a lot after yesterday's hangout and kind

176.26 --> 181.06
of thankful that some of the more

178.75 --> 184.45
trolling commenting is is really dying

you in that studio sixty-eight yeah I've

196.269 --> 200.92000000000002
just been enjoying myself after that and

198.34 --> 205.69
Nathan was like totally on a roll

200.92 --> 207.129
doing his thing pretty pretty well I had

205.69 --> 210.069
my moments as well here and there on the

207.129 --> 215.379
debates but just tried to step back a

210.069 --> 218.53
lot and back and forth with my slicked

215.379 --> 223.06
James that has now decided he's going to

218.53 --> 225.81
be the next Reilly towards me and test

223.06 --> 229.12
my every assertion thing that I say

225.81 --> 230.739
especially during housekeeping but yeah

229.12 --> 233.889
it doesn't realize that I'm very well

230.739 --> 236.739
prepared with yeah the statements that I

233.889 --> 238.66
keep repeating so that yeah that was fun

236.739 --> 243.63
oh yeah Brenda hey Nathan Oakley

238.66 --> 243.63
yeah Brenda Wow what a character

256.08 --> 262.59
yes Lex seems a bit sticky oh well

272.47 --> 284.52000000000004
oh yeah I also got Star Trek Voyager

282.04 --> 288.25
[Music]

284.52 --> 291.19
when you call that again withdrawal

288.25 --> 293.37
symptoms keep wanting to like oh I want

291.19 --> 297.25
to see the next hour that materia snow

293.37 --> 301.53000000000003
so just now watched Star Trek Discovery

297.25 --> 307.66
but it's just such a different show and

301.53 --> 312.15999999999997
doesn't feel natural at all so just some

307.66 --> 314.05
really annoying things I don't know it

312.16 --> 317.65000000000003
just wasn't worked out well it was very

314.05 --> 320.31
sloppily put together and they wanted to

317.65 --> 325.06
get too much out of it and it was just

320.31 --> 329.08
overly dramatized it's just bad story

325.06 --> 331.71
writing I don't know it's this hey

329.08 --> 331.71
what's happening

333.83 --> 344.24
it's just you do yeah yeah so that

342.919 --> 353.94
happened

344.24 --> 357.01
[Music]

353.94 --> 360.28
well right Rambow Jambo well there's

357.01 --> 362.889
just old sci-fi and there's what they

360.28 --> 371.04999999999995
make right now and it seems to be just

362.889 --> 373.41
noisy sloppily put together yeah trying

371.05 --> 376.12
to take like concepts that are

373.41 --> 378.79
interesting that have potential and then

376.12 --> 382.66
sloppily put that all together into some

378.79 --> 386.32
kind of story where the designer of the

382.66 --> 390.01000000000005
story obviously has no true insight unto

386.32 --> 394.27
the things that he's lending ideas from

390.01 --> 397.0
that's just what I get from the second

394.27 --> 401.4
season Star Trek discovery that's my

397.0 --> 401.4
personal opinion about that

405.28 --> 408.28
and

410.1 --> 416.25
I can't actually even directly blame the

413.49 --> 417.90000000000003
actors for it because they seem to be

416.25 --> 420.6
very professional they do their best

417.9 --> 423.92999999999995
it's just that the story is written in a

420.6 --> 427.20000000000005
way that just seems unnatural and I get

423.93 --> 428.55
the feeling that the actors kind of

427.2 --> 433.67
realise that as well

428.55 --> 437.28000000000003
I don't know maybe I'm overanalyzing it

433.67 --> 439.53000000000003
but yeah the serie the series I keep

437.28 --> 444.15
following it but I feel like it's kind

439.53 --> 448.65
of kitsch in a way it's just not not how

444.15 --> 452.21999999999997
I would do it not that I would be able

448.65 --> 456.41999999999996
to just do that because yeah setting up

452.22 --> 458.79
a series or redirecting see redirecting

456.42 --> 464.52000000000004
see rewriting it's a super complex

458.79 --> 469.04
process and I don't really have any

464.52 --> 471.29999999999995
experience with that at all but yeah I

469.04 --> 475.55
can still have an opinion on the

471.3 --> 475.55
internet though right

479.189 --> 490.389
yeah David read it it is but yeah I

485.86 --> 492.78000000000003
concern myself a lot more about the

490.389 --> 496.659
story writing and how it's all done

492.78 --> 499.92999999999995
we're in the acting work how peeling it

496.659 --> 504.18899999999996
is I concern myself with that as well

499.93 --> 506.979
with form I guess because yeah I know it

504.189 --> 509.439
is science fiction but yeah the science

506.979 --> 512.3489999999999
fiction elements and especially the CGI

509.439 --> 514.2090000000001
in that series isn't really that bad at

512.349 --> 516.37
all it's actually pretty good

514.209 --> 519.7289999999999
and almost fascinating by its own

516.37 --> 521.89
volition it's beautiful enough that if

519.729 --> 525.48
there was almost no conversation and

521.89 --> 529.17
social plot lines it would still be very

525.48 --> 532.769
fascinating to look at so the CGI is

529.17 --> 542.2299999999999
extremely extremely well in that series

532.769 --> 543.279
yeah hey gem yeah it was fun to see you

542.23 --> 545.649
on the debates

543.279 --> 550.269
it was pretty ballsy to just come on

545.649 --> 558.899
there and and do your thing good for you

550.269 --> 558.899
man although you do seem to be a bit I

561.209 --> 564.329
don't know

566.98 --> 574.889
you kind of remind me of the nine bladed

569.829 --> 578.7299999999999
sword preacher from life of Ryan a bit

574.889 --> 584.8290000000001
you seem to be very dramatic in your

578.73 --> 589.26
biblical messages but you do it pretty

584.829 --> 594.3389999999999
eloquently little slow maybe but I'm not

589.26 --> 595.959
I'll not get pedantic but but yeah I

594.339 --> 597.519
didn't expect you to just come on the

595.959 --> 603.06
debates to do that I didn't even

597.519 --> 605.92
recognize it with you at first all right

603.06 --> 608.17
AGM that's totally right the world is

605.92 --> 611.5
getting dramatic so you can either

608.17 --> 613.389
choose to be in the eyes in the

611.5 --> 616.32
frequency of the world be seen as

613.389 --> 620.8290000000001
dramatic by making drama out of it

616.32 --> 624.49
dramatizing or you can actually set the

620.829 --> 631.0
right example and avoid the drama and be

624.49 --> 633.99
clear-headed that's what I try to do

631.0 --> 633.99
this oh yeah

636.33 --> 643.2
I try to pull people out of it clear

639.42 --> 646.53
them up not get into the drama - to

643.2 --> 648.9300000000001
reach a wider audience and conveys a

646.53 --> 652.73
message that will most likely be lost

648.93 --> 656.7199999999999
because the people are are dramatized

652.73 --> 656.72
but yeah that's just me

658.64 --> 664.77
all right Ragnar Stefan he'll Larsson I

661.92 --> 670.3499999999999
don't know I haven't actually asked

664.77 --> 672.9
ranty about it but I haven't heard any

670.35 --> 677.5400000000001
emergency message from ranty on the

672.9 --> 680.73
debates even so I think what happened is

677.54 --> 683.0699999999999
that I said it yesterday I think what

680.73 --> 687.33
happened is probably had some kind of

683.07 --> 690.0300000000001
copyright strike for for a song that he

687.33 --> 691.71
uses in his intro or something just like

690.03 --> 695.31
what happened with Globe Buster's a

691.71 --> 698.25
month ago so then he said it all to

695.31 --> 701.4899999999999
private to replace it and it's taking

698.25 --> 704.31
his time maybe he's like really picky on

701.49 --> 707.55
what he's gonna use as a replacement I

704.31 --> 709.92
don't know I'd have to I should ask him

707.55 --> 714.87
as soon as I bump into him in chat or on

709.92 --> 716.76
the debates but yeah that's probably why

714.87 --> 718.68
it's all gone why it all seems to be

716.76 --> 721.2
gone it's not the leaders just set to

718.68 --> 723.9499999999999
private so seems like it's gone for

721.2 --> 723.95
outsiders

725.49 --> 734.3
yeah don't worry about it I wouldn't

728.61 --> 738.35
worry about it until Randy starts to

734.3 --> 738.3499999999999
sound the alarm about it

748.2 --> 754.61
but whose g-men

760.4 --> 770.72
but no no Randy is definitely not gonna

765.65 --> 773.14
turn a globe that's that's a fantasy

770.72 --> 773.14
there

791.57 --> 797.0400000000001
yeah the only downside to having a show

795.39 --> 799.23
and during this time when it's really

797.04 --> 806.6999999999999
good lettuce to actually really want to

799.23 --> 808.5
go outside but oh well that may be

806.7 --> 812.46
eventually I could just set up a mirror

808.5 --> 816.6
or something on the balcony shine the

812.46 --> 825.62
Sun directly at my face Matt don't be

816.6 --> 825.62
weird right it's Friday today

832.56 --> 840.8699999999999
oh yeah should be iron Rome this evening

837.24 --> 842.639
so that that could be nice don't know if

840.87 --> 848.069
they're planning anything haven't kept

842.639 --> 857.66
to close track and of course ball

848.069 --> 857.66
busters Saturday include Buster's Sunday

861.489 --> 872.3290000000001
all right so anyway yeah I am open for

866.779 --> 874.879
guests I've already put out my hangout

872.329 --> 879.579
link in the early bird chat I can put it

874.879 --> 882.5790000000001
in other places as well let's see oh

879.579 --> 882.579
yeah

884.61 --> 892.7090000000001
a guy called mark or contact it mean he

889.86 --> 898.259
was into biochemistry and anthropology

892.709 --> 899.8789999999999
and he wanted to talk so maybe that

898.259 --> 905.809
could be interesting let's see if he's

899.879 --> 905.809
online doesn't say he is but we'll see

921.02 --> 926.74
right that's it that's it for now oh

927.7 --> 936.08
yeah almost forgot of course Joshua

932.089 --> 938.5100000000001

936.08 --> 941.3000000000001
supposedly still coming on this Sunday

938.51 --> 942.95

941.3 --> 944.649
yeah don't forget that that's gonna be

942.95 --> 953.3000000000001
special he's gonna be years I guess

944.649 --> 956.48
we're gonna talk about his lore and his

953.3 --> 959.3299999999999
fuse and Christianity and God and

956.48 --> 962.44
creation very curious to see what he has

959.33 --> 962.44
to has to say

963.73 --> 973.24
seaside go Jim no I don't really gamo I

967.82 --> 973.24
don't don't really like it too much

977.2 --> 980.349
[Music]

986.09 --> 989.289
[Music]

990.29 --> 1000.65
you know Robert cats ipis Tim Osman is

995.76 --> 1005.96
not a flat he is definitely a globe or

1000.65 --> 1008.78
he has been from the start and he's yeah

1005.96 --> 1009.6800000000001
just a nasty baller mostly and he may be

1008.78 --> 1012.26
acting

1009.68 --> 1014.39
he's a flat earther all of a sudden like

1012.26 --> 1017.39
Pete Mars seems to be acting like he's a

1014.39 --> 1022.73
flat earther again but yeah Pete Mars is

1017.39 --> 1025.31
just nuts about Tomas Minh and I don't

1022.73 --> 1029.48
know where why keep hearing this in my

1025.31 --> 1031.79
chat I don't think he is I don't know

1029.48 --> 1040.13
what made you think that he's supposed

1031.79 --> 1043.18
to be a flat earther now no I did not I

1040.13 --> 1043.18
don't watch his hangouts

1077.46 --> 1088.25
hmm this channel is down

1083.549 --> 1088.25
really that's new

1093.68 --> 1098.77
I haven't subscribed to him in a while I

1099.37 --> 1108.4699999999998
mean I unsubscribe him after it just got

1102.62 --> 1110.3899999999999
sick of his stupid one hour just he some

1108.47 --> 1113.45
song he's playing and then eventually

1110.39 --> 1116.39
maybe would be whiny and complaining

1113.45 --> 1118.67
about somebody I got just I just got

1116.39 --> 1122.48
sick of it so I just stopped paying

1118.67 --> 1125.15
attention you know apparently he's not

1122.48 --> 1127.67
ready to get some real debates ago and

1125.15 --> 1131.8700000000001
he's just too damn biased and impulsive

1127.67 --> 1137.47
and I think that Jose Gonzales basically

1131.87 --> 1146.2099999999998
replaced that he's a much better she was

1137.47 --> 1148.309
much more able to be neutral alright

1146.21 --> 1151.82
yeah good tenant good tips for all

1148.309 --> 1156.17
thanks for reminding me yeah that's an

1151.82 --> 1159.61
iron realm tonight crow triple7 and

1156.17 --> 1162.26
Chris mattre are gonna talk about a

1159.61 --> 1164.51
second apparent Sun disc they pick up

1162.26 --> 1167.75
through a special filter very

1164.51 --> 1170.02
fascinating definitely gonna take a good

1167.75 --> 1175.63
look at that and gonna look at how much

1170.02 --> 1178.73
presuppositions they fall into declaring

1175.63 --> 1183.6200000000001
but I'm gonna look at it at my in my own

1178.73 --> 1186.95
way from my lower perspective so yeah

1183.62 --> 1189.3999999999999
looking forward to that that's going to

1186.95 --> 1189.4
be tonight

1207.909 --> 1211.1390000000001
Oh jazz

1217.56 --> 1220.829
[Music]

1238.21 --> 1241.019
see

1249.659 --> 1262.98
that seems like the guest I was hoping

1255.49 --> 1262.98
for is not coming online too bad

1266.67 --> 1271.65
I'm just gonna be following chat now

1268.95 --> 1273.3300000000002
mostly to see if you guys come up with

1271.65 --> 1276.65
something I can talk about because I'm

1273.33 --> 1276.6499999999999
clean out of subjects

1286.05 --> 1294.27
yes because our win said the Sun is not

1291.06 --> 1296.8999999999999
physical and has no distance therefore

1294.27 --> 1300.42
our win must be nutz

1296.9 --> 1303.39
therefore our win declaring people nuts

1300.42 --> 1306.24
must be the other way around right and

1303.39 --> 1308.21
our wind is actually nuts and P Mars and

1306.24 --> 1312.45
Timmy are perfectly normal

1308.21 --> 1316.49
is that your line of reasoning vladimir

1312.45 --> 1316.49
nabokov really

1325.429 --> 1334.679
okay well you go experiment with your

1330.11 --> 1340.79
social media there and do your weird

1334.679 --> 1340.7900000000002
little wizardry go ahead

1345.86 --> 1349.32
[Music]

1351.169 --> 1359.8200000000002
are you asking to become on the panel

1354.24 --> 1363.99
Jessa Conda because I doubt got anything

1359.82 --> 1369.4189999999999
to say that's worth my time I'd rather

1363.99 --> 1373.29
just look at chat I really caught Robert

1369.419 --> 1376.7700000000002
cats if is anthon Antonio did that's

1373.29 --> 1379.73
good I didn't know that but yeah I guess

1376.77 --> 1379.73
he paid attention

1387.74 --> 1394.78
don't worry I was not hoping to get

1390.5 --> 1394.78
Timmy Osmond on definitely not

1402.88 --> 1410.3500000000001
Oh clean that's that's funny that you

1406.21 --> 1414.22
asked that an actual question why use

1410.35 --> 1416.6799999999998
gravity not just ether well they're both

1414.22 --> 1420.67
concepts that are not scientifically

1416.68 --> 1424.5700000000002
provable they can only arise in our

1420.67 --> 1429.01
consciousness in our imagination as a

1424.57 --> 1431.2
concept as a deduction based concept so

1429.01 --> 1433.24
yeah sure you can have all these

1431.2 --> 1436.06
concepts out there and you can say oh

1433.24 --> 1438.88
this must be that and you can't prove

1436.06 --> 1442.6499999999999
Ivor so it doesn't really matter it's

1438.88 --> 1447.4
just juggling with yeah concepts

1442.65 --> 1450.63
unfortunately deduction based things is

1447.4 --> 1450.63
not scientifically provable

1462.16 --> 1469.66
no no Daniel density is not a deduction

1466.72 --> 1477.75
based concept because you can physically

1469.66 --> 1482.0800000000002
prove it you can yeah it is a

1477.75 --> 1486.73
cross-section of volume and mass of

1482.08 --> 1489.76
matter but yet that is provable the

1486.73 --> 1493.2
relation is provable and changeable you

1489.76 --> 1496.56
can use it as an independent variable so

1493.2 --> 1496.56
that's the difference

1506.149 --> 1513.2289999999998
mass oh ho God now we're going to go

1508.909 --> 1517.779
really technical mass is the element of

1513.229 --> 1522.189
matter that makes it susceptible to

1517.779 --> 1522.189
forces and displacement

1525.82 --> 1532.479
like yeah like a sail to catch the wind

1528.7 --> 1536.279
as it were that's what the mass factor

1532.479 --> 1536.279
represents in magic

1547.25 --> 1550.97
you figure it out

1569.24 --> 1582.11
wait so are you saying that gravity is

1576.23 --> 1585.169
okay because mass is just a concept and

1582.11 --> 1588.529
you can scientifically prove it that

1585.169 --> 1591.0490000000002
seems terribly Nia lists that's kind of

1588.529 --> 1593.6
desperate like nothing is true so our

1591.049 --> 1597.3799999999999
imagination can be just as true that's

1593.6 --> 1601.6399999999999
it's a terrible terrible habit to pursue

1597.38 --> 1604.1490000000001
intellectually falls into the category

1601.64 --> 1604.1490000000001
of solipsism

1629.78 --> 1636.47
now the desperate you're being desperate

1632.3 --> 1641.06
Daniel sorry and the gonna entertain

1636.47 --> 1644.5
your line of thinking here sorry got to

1641.06 --> 1644.5
come up with something better than that

1649.01 --> 1662.24
hello Jeremy Bennett yeah it's half past

1658.59 --> 1662.24
2:00 p.m. here

1694.83 --> 1703.4089999999999
well registered berliner yeah that's

1700.24 --> 1705.94
right force of gravity is no theory

1703.409 --> 1713.14
because it can't be scientifically

1705.94 --> 1716.1100000000001
proven so it's just the concept and yeah

1713.14 --> 1718.3300000000002
then you say you deny that by saying

1716.11 --> 1721.4699999999998
that the theory tries to describe the

1718.33 --> 1725.309
mechanism behind it well no the concept

1721.47 --> 1731.2
conceptualizes the mechanism behind it

1725.309 --> 1733.86
and it works out yeah but you can't

1731.2 --> 1739.8400000000001
actually prove it

1733.86 --> 1743.62
not really remains a concept you can

1739.84 --> 1750.1589999999999
deduce it widely from many angles that's

1743.62 --> 1753.6589999999999
part of the grabber ation that's but it

1750.159 --> 1753.659
remains conceptual or

1766.029 --> 1768.629
right

1773.899 --> 1784.0189999999998
no concept of God it's an apparent force

1781.399 --> 1785.5189999999998
gravity is an apparent force it just

1784.019 --> 1788.1490000000001
appears to be there there's an

1785.519 --> 1792.869
aberration causing these suggestions

1788.149 --> 1795.599
from wide approaches that there should

1792.869 --> 1800.629
be some kind of force there if yeah you

1795.599 --> 1800.629
can deduce that you can't prove it

1823.37 --> 1826.06
right

1828.49 --> 1832.95
yeah this seems hopeless

1834.79 --> 1837.99
[Music]

1855.1 --> 1858.8799999999999
daylight-savings god

1864.28 --> 1870.11
right okay this is a totally different

1867.17 --> 1874.5500000000002
type of question but Robert cats hippies

1870.11 --> 1880.6999999999998
think daylight savings is that relating

1874.55 --> 1883.75
to the electricity costs because I think

1880.7 --> 1886.46
that electrical companies like

1883.75 --> 1889.79
electricity to be used not just at night

1886.46 --> 1894.64
at the day as well I don't know maybe

1889.79 --> 1894.6399999999999
I'm just completely off

1918.18 --> 1920.75
Wow

1937.99 --> 1948.309
there's a lot of new people in chat it's

1943.289 --> 1951.7
bit confusing because I not too sure if

1948.309 --> 1954.1789999999999
some of these people are trolls or just

1951.7 --> 1957.72
kind of ballers that are trying to

1954.179 --> 1960.94
figure out what to do with this chat

1957.72 --> 1964.419
Thank You Jeremy Bennett for the super

1960.94 --> 1967.029
chat donation thanks a lot man okay says

1964.419 --> 1969.279
good job Arwen keep pursuing truth I

1967.029 --> 1974.399
know it's exhausting but good job dude

1969.279 --> 1978.52
try not to lose steam thanks yeah I

1974.399 --> 1983.549
agree it can be a little exhausting but

1978.52 --> 1988.899
you get used to it you grow skin for it

1983.549 --> 1991.96
and I look I haven't had a real anger

1988.899 --> 1997.899
outburst in a long time so yeah I try

1991.96 --> 2001.789
not to lose any steam mmm hey Ellie be

1997.899 --> 2001.789
good to see you and chat by the way

2044.48 --> 2056.77
what no I I don't have any need to go

2050.47 --> 2056.77
full hog really I don't have a lot of

2058.18 --> 2063.83
conflicts that I'm trying to suppress

2060.74 --> 2068.6299999999997
that I need to let off some steam no

2063.83 --> 2082.52
thanks not necessarily so but thanks for

2068.63 --> 2086.0
the offer though AGM thanks thanks for

2082.52 --> 2092.06
that seaside go Jim thanks for putting

2086.0 --> 2095.53
me in of putting me and vegan [ __ ] in the

2092.06 --> 2095.5299999999997
same category thanks a lot

2106.61 --> 2114.08
no Daniel relative density isn't a

2111.29 --> 2117.5
deductive based concept because she can

2114.08 --> 2119.36
scientifically prove it so described as

2117.5 --> 2125.99
has been described as has been

2119.36 --> 2128.15
demonstrated on the debates with quantum

2125.99 --> 2134.6299999999997
erasers hangouts if you could bear to

2128.15 --> 2144.17
sit through those no offense John so

2134.63 --> 2148.19
yeah it is it is scientifically provable

2144.17 --> 2151.79
not just a deductive based concept and

2148.19 --> 2154.61
it is beyond an empirical deduction as

2151.79 --> 2156.89
well it is scientifically provable

2154.61 --> 2159.3700000000003
because you can vary the independent

2156.89 --> 2159.37
variable

2169.89 --> 2177.5899999999997
no Daniel you can isolate the effects of

2173.55 --> 2177.59
the other variables very easily

2198.9 --> 2203.98
Daniel if you're gonna spout more

2201.07 --> 2206.7400000000002
[ __ ] out I'm considering just

2203.98 --> 2210.869
removing you for misinformation

2206.74 --> 2214.95
placement here so don't go there because

2210.869 --> 2214.9500000000003
that really pisses me off

2232.43 --> 2253.1499999999996
bye thanks for dropping by yeah

2278.15 --> 2287.79
lotty says I wouldn't ascribe quantum

2281.4 --> 2293.4
eraser that much credit although he did

2287.79 --> 2296.49
help out a lot to clear up certain areas

2293.4 --> 2302.2200000000003
that we wouldn't even have seen existed

2296.49 --> 2306.7799999999997
really so he did help out a lot but yeah

2302.22 --> 2310.77
all of us the debaters Nathan me Anthony

2306.78 --> 2315.15
and John as well of course that is very

2310.77 --> 2320.31
strong rigid input but we all figured it

2315.15 --> 2323.2400000000002
out on the way I got to the optical

2320.31 --> 2326.49
slant he still very proud of that I

2323.24 --> 2328.5
think I was probably among the first

2326.49 --> 2331.5299999999997
people to declare the Sun to be

2328.5 --> 2333.81
holographic in nature did that two years

2331.53 --> 2337.8500000000004
ago at least maybe three now I don't

2333.81 --> 2340.68
know time seems to be flying or recently

2337.85 --> 2342.99
it all feels like it all just happened

2340.68 --> 2345.6299999999997
yesterday or like in the time span of

2342.99 --> 2350.06
half a year but it's been three years

2345.63 --> 2354.33
now four years not three years active

2350.06 --> 2356.93
active YouTube it's incredible how short

2354.33 --> 2356.93
it all seems

2363.51 --> 2373.4500000000003
no not a hologram holographic light

2368.29 --> 2379.81
based in nature and the origin remains a

2373.45 --> 2382.06
mystery although again I've said the I'm

2379.81 --> 2386.11
starting out saying it almost every

2382.06 --> 2389.35
episode okay I have a concept very very

2386.11 --> 2392.53
ethereal numb physically confirmable

2389.35 --> 2396.46
concept by at this time it can it could

2392.53 --> 2398.5
be in some way eventually so it's not

2396.46 --> 2402.76
entirely out of the reach of of

2398.5 --> 2406.18
empirically deducible but that the

2402.76 --> 2408.19
lights including the daylight and the

2406.18 --> 2410.71
moonlight and all the light of the stars

2408.19 --> 2415.27
and everything the globe of the heavens

2410.71 --> 2421.27
will be caused by some kind of critical

2415.27 --> 2425.04
mass in a certain pattern in the high

2421.27 --> 2428.35
atmosphere caused by you have I I

2425.04 --> 2430.81
electricity tension fields what is up

2428.35 --> 2434.68
there some kind of high electricity

2430.81 --> 2437.46
related yeah optical side effect a

2434.68 --> 2441.1
phenomena that just happens to be this

2437.46 --> 2442.41
miraculously this miraculous I think it

2441.1 --> 2445.71
could be like that and it's very

2442.41 --> 2450.43
conceptual it's very ethereal and

2445.71 --> 2452.7400000000002
complex to even and visualize that it's

2450.43 --> 2454.6
still complex to me to even try to and

2452.74 --> 2458.9799999999996
visualize it but I'm getting there

2454.6 --> 2461.86
slowly but yeah that's the only approach

2458.98 --> 2463.57
that I can think of that keeps it kind

2461.86 --> 2467.32
of in the physical realm and not

2463.57 --> 2469.75
something like extra dimensional which

2467.32 --> 2473.25
is just totally unprovable at this point

2469.75 --> 2473.25
so yeah

2477.5 --> 2486.08
Oh what I can't conceptualize things am

2483.44 --> 2490.01
i declaring this science and I declaring

2486.08 --> 2494.09
this to be scientific facts the absolute

2490.01 --> 2496.6090000000004
unavoidable truth no it's a concept it's

2494.09 --> 2499.82
speculation as to what could be causing

2496.609 --> 2503.72
the holographic nature of the heavens

2499.82 --> 2507.07
and there's a lot of evidence not

2503.72 --> 2511.52
scientific evidence but yeah

2507.07 --> 2513.94
observations and deductions based on

2511.52 --> 2517.099
these observations so empirical

2513.94 --> 2518.54
deduction based evidence that the

2517.099 --> 2520.4900000000002
heavenly bodies all of it are

2518.54 --> 2522.68
holographic and I explained it a great

2520.49 --> 2526.7
many times and I'm not going to

2522.68 --> 2531.2799999999997
completely repeat myself over and over

2526.7 --> 2531.2799999999997
again not constantly anyway

2536.33 --> 2539.5
[Music]

2545.08 --> 2550.93
I don't get upset when people don't

2548.26 --> 2555.8500000000004
accept my concepts I actually expected

2550.93 --> 2559.93
it disappoints me a little maybe I get

2555.85 --> 2566.89
upset when people keep asking keep

2559.93 --> 2570.94
ignoring it and and yet keep on asking

2566.89 --> 2573.0899999999997
the same question over again so I have

2570.94 --> 2577.4500000000003
to explain the same thing over again

2573.09 --> 2579.73
that that is the part that annoys me if

2577.45 --> 2581.98
you don't get it then you don't get it

2579.73 --> 2584.5
then just listen to the same thing over

2581.98 --> 2587.23
and over again look if you want to like

2584.5 --> 2589.39
record every response to every question

2587.23 --> 2593.11
and ever made you'll find that I'm

2589.39 --> 2594.4
pretty damn consistent okay you don't

2593.11 --> 2598.15
have to test me on this

2594.4 --> 2601.81
I am very consistent in my explanations

2598.15 --> 2605.35
but I also do evolve and I admit that in

2601.81 --> 2609.7
certain regions but once it's set in a

2605.35 --> 2611.86
way it's optimized it's the best

2609.7 --> 2614.2599999999998
explanation I can give for the time

2611.86 --> 2617.02
being until something new pops up that

2614.26 --> 2620.59
brings an entire different light to the

2617.02 --> 2623.38
whole thing but yeah I will give the

2620.59 --> 2625.42
same explanations very consistently so

2623.38 --> 2628.03
you don't have to ask them over and over

2625.42 --> 2630.76
again okay if you don't get it just

2628.03 --> 2634.21
listen to my explanation over and over

2630.76 --> 2639.7000000000003
again from the same recording it's very

2634.21 --> 2642.57
simple and if you still don't get it

2639.7 --> 2642.5699999999997
yeah tough luck

2647.88 --> 2658.6
morning Hey I guess Oh two guests hello

2656.76 --> 2661.63
you don't know we're here

2658.6 --> 2667.63
I know I hadn't cheated how long have

2661.63 --> 2670.96
you been in there right right

2667.63 --> 2671.65
ah I've been I've been in for about 30

2670.96 --> 2675.46
minutes

2671.65 --> 2679.4100000000003
Jesus oh my weekend or weekend oh and

2675.46 --> 2679.41
I'm just talking a bit fight not even

2680.13 --> 2687.88
okay okay I just fight five minutes me I

2684.4 --> 2691.59
just let you I just ladies all right

2687.88 --> 2695.11
thanks for joining yeah we didn't trust

2691.59 --> 2698.8500000000004
anything you wanted to talk about yeah

2695.11 --> 2701.7400000000002
well it was actually always a always

2698.85 --> 2704.3199999999997
yeah I was a backboard with fly L so I

2701.74 --> 2706.8399999999997
started looking at some old Illuminati

2704.32 --> 2709.8700000000003
stuff well back to the old days and

2706.84 --> 2713.44
there I came across our interests and

2709.87 --> 2716.3199999999997
those are those se hip-hop gaining just

2713.44 --> 2718.39
get sure right and then the black

2716.32 --> 2721.53
community Nicole now folks folks

2718.39 --> 2724.6
flagging stuff it out but the ways are

2721.53 --> 2727.02
of it there was quite a funny thing he

2724.6 --> 2731.68
was actually making a documentary about

2727.02 --> 2734.65
in that's a gang called dr. C B I don't

2731.68 --> 2739.1499999999996
know if you have held of him no and I

2734.65 --> 2741.31
really know right okay so what he he

2739.15 --> 2745.3
started up in the seventies back in

2741.31 --> 2748.72
nineteen seventy less dr. C be spied

2745.3 --> 2751.09
curing people using Helms and stuff like

2748.72 --> 2753.73

and he started advertising and the news

2753.73 --> 2761.82
people seen I can cure AIDS cancer blah

2757.42 --> 2764.23
blah everything so he cleaned it so they

2761.82 --> 2766.1200000000003
would you call this a you know II got

2764.23 --> 2770.65
child the FBI

2766.12 --> 2772.66
clashed and his house arrested them took

2770.65 --> 2775.9900000000002
him in court because he was making

2772.66 --> 2779.8399999999997
fraudulent claims and then he took him

2775.99 --> 2782.06
to court and he won and his court case

2779.84 --> 2786.2000000000003
and he's in cured and counseled and EADS

2782.06 --> 2787.1
for the last well like 40 years is he

2786.2 --> 2791.74
just died

2787.1 --> 2796.79
that was a maybe came across he was 80

2791.74 --> 2799.5499999999997
82 year old 82 years old but I was the

2796.79 --> 2802.13
thing I thought about was nah nah that's

2799.55 --> 2805.25
quite funny that forget about that you

2802.13 --> 2807.83
know he won the court case it's Biden it

2805.25 --> 2810.17
had the news people's again he cure

2807.83 --> 2812.96
leads in cancer and he won the court

2810.17 --> 2815.78
case yeah that is incredible and then he

2812.96 --> 2818.7200000000003
was last lay even the Supreme Court and

2815.78 --> 2820.2200000000003
was a backboard case in the 87 I think

2818.72 --> 2823.91
that was I just found out the other day

2820.22 --> 2828.5899999999997
I was like whoa yeah because the phonic

2823.91 --> 2829.79
ties the that he'd been doing it he'd

2828.59 --> 2833.9900000000002
been doing it for so long but I just

2829.79 --> 2835.46
wondered by nava nava chemo and Wow I

2833.99 --> 2837.6499999999996
can't have an explanation for that

2835.46 --> 2840.92
because it was totally covered up by the

2837.65 --> 2843.9500000000003
media that's like hush-hush don't

2840.92 --> 2845.4500000000003
imagine imagine yeah exactly imagine I

2843.95 --> 2849.08
will just think about imagine a

2845.45 --> 2852.08
scientist write a if they didn't so he'd

2849.08 --> 2854.45
get the Nobel Prize any and he was a

2852.08 --> 2857.18
straight-a partner he was charged and he

2854.45 --> 2860.0899999999997
said we want proof we want nine patients

2857.18 --> 2862.22
of different diseases to come and and

2860.09 --> 2866.81
taste a fire on your behalf

2862.22 --> 2869.0299999999997
he brought in 7777 people came and he

2866.81 --> 2872.18
caught and they taste to find yup we are

2869.03 --> 2874.7000000000003
cured they applauded doctors they blow

2872.18 --> 2877.7
all of doctors shown that they had

2874.7 --> 2880.8999999999996
cancer and wait two weeks later after

2877.7 --> 2884.21
they start eating as cure a monthly on

2880.9 --> 2887.12
or whatever they were killed

2884.21 --> 2890.84
that's awesome great can't tell anything

2887.12 --> 2892.58
about the nature of the treatment right

2890.84 --> 2895.58
he was from the one he was from

2892.58 --> 2897.38
Guatemala right but what it was as he

2895.58 --> 2899.6
was down he was honestly down in

2897.38 --> 2902.12
Guatemala and he got really really le

2899.6 --> 2904.19
her diabetes and everything hmm

2902.12 --> 2907.13
and one of the locals and that's

2904.19 --> 2909.44
happened like you know like 50 years ago

2907.13 --> 2912.42
the guy was like 80 if you stay as I say

2909.44 --> 2917.039
just died he was 81 now

2912.42 --> 2920.869
as I see but he he with a and one of the

2917.039 --> 2923.25
local doctors or whatever cure them

2920.869 --> 2924.69
absolutely everything his wife it taste

2923.25 --> 2928.65
if I she said I couldn't believe her

2924.69 --> 2930.329
so what he did was he ill ill L he's

2928.65 --> 2933.779
actually got a place she can honestly go

2930.329 --> 2935.369
to you know he's got all that and

2933.779 --> 2938.76
they've still got a little refuge and

2935.369 --> 2941.4900000000002
they just make up as like elbow elbow

2938.76 --> 2942.2400000000002
remedies but yeah actually any oh and

2941.49 --> 2945.3799999999997
another thing

2942.24 --> 2949.6499999999996
he actually represented himself in court

2945.38 --> 2952.559
so he actually won thank you exactly he

2949.65 --> 2955.829
actually won he beat in beat them the

2952.559 --> 2959.94
mate of the I'm sure the pharmaceutical

2955.829 --> 2961.44
companies you know so that was just that

2959.94 --> 2962.569
was what I wanted come on and I just

2961.44 --> 2966.2400000000002
found out the other day and I thought

2962.569 --> 2967.89
come on man you know forget no no the

2966.24 --> 2970.799
thing isn't open when people sheriff

2967.89 --> 2974.0389999999998
Andy vaccines and stuff like that with

2970.799 --> 2977.279
II's waffle okay I'll win anyway I've

2974.039 --> 2980.5490000000004
also noticed the chemo about those Hawks

2977.279 --> 2982.44
is about him or doctor ZB was a halt but

2980.549 --> 2984.99
when you actually look at net no he

2982.44 --> 2988.38
wasn't he wasn't actually but was a few

2984.99 --> 2990.45
you use a Hawks but no you know alright

2988.38 --> 2992.1600000000003
they made a lot of conspiracy theories

2990.45 --> 2996.0
about him just like with colloidal

2992.16 --> 2999.21
silver the blue man [ __ ] just all of

2996.0 --> 3002.539
a sudden since he died oh it's right

2999.21 --> 3004.7
then really yeah and that dad definitely

3002.539 --> 3007.009
a sign of desperation because yeah when

3004.7 --> 3010.6699999999996
people died they do get attention one

3007.009 --> 3012.829
way or the other so yeah quickly mock it

3010.67 --> 3016.4900000000002
up to prevent people from being

3012.829 --> 3018.4700000000003
interested quickly man that's amazing I

3016.49 --> 3021.5589999999997
will imagine that raking in claims

3018.47 --> 3023.45
getting taken to court by the United

3021.559 --> 3025.759
States government and the mate of the

3023.45 --> 3027.89
you know the Attorney General they get

3025.759 --> 3031.099
the may Allah and he walks and defends

3027.89 --> 3033.41
himself and one case this must month

3031.099 --> 3036.23
just like that they basically whipped

3033.41 --> 3039.3799999999997
Satan they're right it's pretty clear

3036.23 --> 3042.2
she is a funny yeah she's been terrified

3039.38 --> 3044.92
of him after that point although we died

3042.2 --> 3048.9399999999996
the way he died was even funny alright

3044.92 --> 3053.5
is because what happened he was down in

3048.94 --> 3057.28
Guatemala and he got arrested in

3053.5 --> 3059.86
Guatemala can he go pneumoniae and he

3057.28 --> 3063.5800000000004
here we go the classic he died on the

3059.86 --> 3064.78
way to the hospital he won diesl arrest

3063.58 --> 3067.2999999999997
him I don't know what you got arrested

3064.78 --> 3069.2200000000003
for it was all that's right he came in

3067.3 --> 3072.46
in Guatemala where there is seven

3069.22 --> 3075.79
thousand dollars and they said that he

3072.46 --> 3078.19
was money laundering well he got caught

3075.79 --> 3082.62
coming in in Guatemala and Ivy after he

3078.19 --> 3088.06
got arrested I taken a taken to a jail

3082.62 --> 3089.92
go l that very same day or the day after

3088.06 --> 3092.02
or something and on the way at the

3089.92 --> 3093.85
hospital he died and and I'm I'm

3092.02 --> 3095.83
thinking out when June or it's like

3093.85 --> 3098.11
because I always think you know there's

3095.83 --> 3100.66
a thing called degree a week thing but

3098.11 --> 3103.15
you you know those are the I think the

3100.66 --> 3105.3399999999997
minds with me predicted that I think

3103.15 --> 3107.9500000000003
what they were or when you were talking

3105.34 --> 3112.2000000000003
about herbs it's like a natural thing he

3107.95 --> 3115.98
knew that less with enemies sell me a

3112.2 --> 3118.6
would you call it you know excelling

3115.98 --> 3121.45
less came to thank know this guy I'm

3118.6 --> 3125.11
thinking this guy was you know they've

3121.45 --> 3126.8799999999997
realized that this game a this guy he

3125.11 --> 3129.46
was no afraid you know he's cured can

3126.88 --> 3132.13
summer and stuff like that and I think

3129.46 --> 3134.02
he's been cut off now it's been left in

3132.13 --> 3137.4100000000003
the body only got a really ride was well

3134.02 --> 3140.61
from from what you describe to me it

3137.41 --> 3143.29
gives me the impression that perhaps

3140.61 --> 3145.4500000000003
like worried the well perhaps they were

3143.29 --> 3147.91
trying to like make a deal with him like

3145.45 --> 3151.8399999999997
make him an offer to basically let him

3147.91 --> 3156.16
back in and like give this idea like

3151.84 --> 3158.6200000000003
yeah you can come back just don't remind

3156.16 --> 3161.08
everyone about the past and we'll kind

3158.62 --> 3164.22
of work it out but they actually then

3161.08 --> 3166.36
used it as a trap to just poison him

3164.22 --> 3169.12
yeah but he was allowed to be in

3166.36 --> 3171.88
Guatemala yeah I know I love them

3169.12 --> 3173.68
oh yeah so so he would basically go

3171.88 --> 3176.19
somewhere with a big suitcase of money

3173.68 --> 3178.33
or something or it was handed to him and

3176.19 --> 3181.93
they poison him in some

3178.33 --> 3185.68
way so then it's just appeared to just

3181.93 --> 3188.68
get a sudden disease and then die from

3185.68 --> 3191.23
it that's that could very well be

3188.68 --> 3194.9199999999996
poisoning it's just a way to get him out

3191.23 --> 3198.73
of the way but yeah from him approaching

3194.92 --> 3200.26
them because they probably did offer him

3198.73 --> 3202.15
some kind of deal and he might have

3200.26 --> 3204.2200000000003
thought like yeah well maybe they are

3202.15 --> 3207.4
going to behave now and I can just

3204.22 --> 3210.8799999999997
expand it just being a naive doctor

3207.4 --> 3212.8
basically could could be I don't know

3210.88 --> 3215.11
he's got places he's got places and

3212.8 --> 3218.5
about four countries like you go a less

3215.11 --> 3221.71
refuge and you actually it gets a what

3218.5 --> 3223.51
you call it and you know designed for

3221.71 --> 3225.9700000000003
you you getting different for teams you

3223.51 --> 3227.6800000000003
get me those a couple of recipes you

3225.97 --> 3229.98
know that's it's not the same cure for

3227.68 --> 3233.74
all the diseases it's definitely once

3229.98 --> 3237.16
you know so but his wife still alive and

3233.74 --> 3239.2
I think she she still knows a noise like

3237.16 --> 3242.35
a king the race of Pisa stuff like that

3239.2 --> 3245.9199999999996
but Ryan tracing not was right so it was

3242.35 --> 3247.96
just a herbalist master yeah exactly

3245.92 --> 3252.76
well then it's a really a matter of

3247.96 --> 3257.59
getting the recipes and yeah that could

3252.76 --> 3259.51
be universalized even even against the

3257.59 --> 3261.55
wheel off the medical industry just like

3259.51 --> 3264.0600000000004
yeah it's available now everywhere you

3261.55 --> 3267.4500000000003
can just buy it at any grocery store

3264.06 --> 3269.98
there you go exactly it could be done

3267.45 --> 3273.79
before yields Arwen he's been doing this

3269.98 --> 3276.7
for 40 years I believe it why believe in

3273.79 --> 3279.16
herbs a lot so yes so do all this is a

3276.7 --> 3281.0499999999997
thing I do but imagine you know they

3279.16 --> 3284.2599999999998
scale or less deception but less is what

3281.05 --> 3286.6000000000004
I always seen right this is Agee and

3284.26 --> 3288.01
mate you know obviously you'd have to go

3286.6 --> 3290.02
and look at the court case fainted

3288.01 --> 3293.7700000000004
quarterfinals but known as a good case

3290.02 --> 3295.99
when a when a people when you talk about

3293.77 --> 3298.66
vaccines to all these Global's or their

3295.99 --> 3300.7599999999998
vaccine you know the the promoters

3298.66 --> 3303.7
making that people know you've got proof

3300.76 --> 3305.9500000000003
that the government does lie about less

3303.7 --> 3309.04
precise his health muscles specifically

3305.95 --> 3310.6299999999997
to do her health that ease people the

3309.04 --> 3311.54
more so it's about over it's a good

3310.63 --> 3314.3
example

3311.54 --> 3317.08
uses an argument but I could could you

3314.3 --> 3319.2200000000003
help me with the exact that like not

3317.08 --> 3322.22
necessarily right now but just drop it

3319.22 --> 3324.3199999999997
in Skype like a video the name and the

3322.22 --> 3327.23
date of that court case and everything

3324.32 --> 3330.19
because it is like a really good factoid

3327.23 --> 3331.76
to smack into Absalom Attica

3330.19 --> 3336.58
industrialists face

3331.76 --> 3339.1400000000003
they only whine about the manic

3336.58 --> 3341.5699999999997
industrialists yeah medical

3339.14 --> 3344.12
industrialists there's a lot of

3341.57 --> 3346.2400000000002
corporatists people that are just go

3344.12 --> 3349.81
doing it for the money and there's

3346.24 --> 3352.5499999999997
especially in the younger people so

3349.81 --> 3354.92
wealthy late what schipper it's late

3352.55 --> 3356.51
those on but knows what someone that was

3354.92 --> 3358.34
on the night in knowing sake well I

3356.51 --> 3359.21
think about scientists mail or something

3358.34 --> 3361.9700000000003
right

3359.21 --> 3364.79
she basically takes that she's all for

3361.97 --> 3367.4599999999996
vaccines and shown in bold yeah vaccines

3364.79 --> 3371.2
are good and there's stuff like was she

3367.46 --> 3374.18
actually she's actually I think she's

3371.2 --> 3376.6699999999996
threatening to cool down a channel one

3374.18 --> 3378.41
of these just like might be a herbalist

3376.67 --> 3380.9900000000002
or something I never really I just

3378.41 --> 3384.29
caught it in person being a thing but

3380.99 --> 3387.35
she's and she's got the mate of the non

3384.29 --> 3390.32
sick of community which actually over

3387.35 --> 3392.48
told me got a straight and the Eisley

3390.32 --> 3393.2000000000003
one the I sling over tongue they've got

3392.48 --> 3397.34
a lot of power

3393.2 --> 3400.0099999999998
meanwhile a high up people are in that

3397.34 --> 3402.8
some Bank community non c'est quoi the

3400.01 --> 3404.3300000000004
Eisley overturned one of the YouTube you

3404.33 --> 3408.92
that the ego talking to someone you know

3406.76 --> 3410.9
talking to a person seen like this is a

3408.92 --> 3412.79
real I was blah blah I said not and you

3423.74 --> 3429.89
I was losing the non sacred oh sure I'm

3426.86 --> 3436.19
saying regarding minimal it was to do a

3429.89 --> 3438.3399999999997
YouTube talking about no no you mean he

3436.19 --> 3441.08
got strikes

3438.34 --> 3443.27
sorry I just completely lost track of

3441.08 --> 3445.34
what you reenact explained on you know

3443.27 --> 3447.82
one yeah do tend to do

3445.34 --> 3454.3
the Norden sake once you'll go astray

3447.82 --> 3456.92
and and the the gun turned against it

3454.3 --> 3458.75
basically well well they got talking to

3456.92 --> 3460.94
someone they honestly go physically

3458.75 --> 3463.64
talking to someone and said turn it over

3460.94 --> 3467.06
you know oh yes a connection with one of

3463.64 --> 3467.81
the YouTube hierarchy the moderator yeah

3467.06 --> 3469.64
exactly

3467.81 --> 3473.12
all right they've got that go for him

3469.64 --> 3475.7
goodie yeah yeah but that that's why we

3473.12 --> 3479.87
see in a very so that scientists male

3475.7 --> 3482.21
that is attacking the the people are

3479.87 --> 3484.64
seeing vaccines on bad heels or science

3482.21 --> 3487.34
she's trying to get that channel shot

3484.64 --> 3490.37
down and I was just saying she's got the

3487.34 --> 3492.6200000000003
might of the Norden sake while behind up

3490.37 --> 3496.85
these people are quite dangerous and my

3492.62 --> 3499.0
kinda aspect of things you know the meet

3496.85 --> 3502.8199999999997
the people are trying to shut down the

3499.0 --> 3505.01
just like what we're doing like you know

3502.82 --> 3508.5800000000004
this is a new subject as it has nothing

3505.01 --> 3512.9300000000003
to do with the doctor anymore so just

3508.58 --> 3514.58
feels right yeah yeah right but you

3512.93 --> 3518.48
couldn't I thought you were still kind

3514.58 --> 3521.12
of tying it was it was because that

3518.48 --> 3523.91
scientist male is a fact so she's all

3521.12 --> 3526.7599999999998
thought a vaccines and stuff and she

3523.91 --> 3527.6
would be a good person to say hey look

3526.76 --> 3528.92
at this thing

3527.6 --> 3532.64
what do you think of us are your

3528.92 --> 3535.4300000000003
vaccines is safe here as a guy it was

3532.64 --> 3538.25
just a specific person it it could be

3535.43 --> 3542.6
used against as evidence you know and an

3538.25 --> 3545.21
argument for the vaccine companies and

3542.6 --> 3548.69
chemical companies you know they are

3545.21 --> 3550.9700000000003
hiding certain things you know yeah and

3548.69 --> 3554.41
not just that the medical industrial

3550.97 --> 3558.9199999999996
complex also entails the justice system

3554.41 --> 3562.16
it is a just a system Lobby corruption

3558.92 --> 3564.44
in many complex ways and there is

3562.16 --> 3566.0899999999997
attention to it but they always find a

3564.44 --> 3570.8
way to keep it going

3566.09 --> 3573.8900000000003
so yeah medical industrial complex is

3570.8 --> 3577.1000000000004
very annoying and they keep out real

3573.89 --> 3580.64
cures very persistently

3577.1 --> 3584.12
and they use the entire judicial

3580.64 --> 3587.21
apparatus they have for it to make that

3584.12 --> 3588.83
happen so yeah this story about that

3587.21 --> 3590.66
doctor that I've never even heard of

3588.83 --> 3593.0
that totally fits into the picture of

3590.66 --> 3596.75
that it's been happier than many times

3593.0 --> 3599.57
in the last century there's a documented

3596.75 --> 3601.88
proof now like you said like you clearly

3599.57 --> 3604.6400000000003
stayed it's uncanny

3601.88 --> 3607.4300000000003
no it's a we've got well we've got huh

3604.64 --> 3610.43
but it was no gone documented proof that

3607.43 --> 3611.8999999999996
that's guy you know you know he must

3610.43 --> 3613.91
have been you we do I love I easy with

3611.9 --> 3615.32
the went to jail in the slowly they

3613.91 --> 3618.23
haven't got an argument you know they

3615.32 --> 3620.51
know whatever they say forget it

3618.23 --> 3623.54
you know that's guy is this guy won his

3620.51 --> 3626.3900000000003
case he said he that does the government

3623.54 --> 3629.7799999999997
said no you can't prove he proved that

3626.39 --> 3632.27
in the story so then you can see them so

3629.78 --> 3636.17
you know what of you so how come that

3632.27 --> 3639.59
and that was like four year 42 years ago

3636.17 --> 3643.85
not half so I felt it two years ago not

3639.59 --> 3645.71
happen you know or they don't hide stuff

3643.85 --> 3651.5
you know they don't hide anything from

3645.71 --> 3654.25
us hmm well that the controllers just

3651.5 --> 3657.38
try to keep it out of our attention and

3654.25 --> 3659.93
use peer pressure in very in not so

3657.38 --> 3663.5
obvious ways at first to keep it out of

3659.93 --> 3665.96
the attention I have a counter like

3663.5 --> 3669.8
punishment like social punishment in

3665.96 --> 3672.59
response to people who engage in that

3669.8 --> 3674.3
kind of thing in public that's how they

3672.59 --> 3676.3700000000003
used to do it and now there are social

3674.3 --> 3680.9
media and it's like taking a life on on

3676.37 --> 3684.7599999999998
its own so yeah now they have to amp up

3680.9 --> 3689.12
the the harshness of the strategy and

3684.76 --> 3691.28
they are yeah yeah they are and they're

3689.12 --> 3693.83
getting desperate when taste but this is

3691.28 --> 3696.53
a great thing about almond when people

3693.83 --> 3697.52
get - - but they meet mistakes so

3696.53 --> 3699.65
they're gonna I think they're gonna

3697.52 --> 3703.85
actually start in this it's maybe

3699.65 --> 3705.5
ferocity a pick up and on and point them

3703.85 --> 3707.5899999999997
out or train point a movie but I think

3705.5 --> 3710.0
no gonna start making more and more

3707.59 --> 3713.06
Mystique's I think are getting more

3710.0 --> 3716.83
desperate well they're under attack from

3713.06 --> 3721.2799999999997
many angles now like from the grassroots

3716.83 --> 3724.43
but also from leadership of certain

3721.28 --> 3728.44
countries top-down so yeah they're

3724.43 --> 3730.97
getting attacked from two fronts now and

3728.44 --> 3734.2000000000003
yeah they are getting desperate and they

3730.97 --> 3740.4399999999996
should be because they're in big trouble

3734.2 --> 3743.48
yeah yeah they they basically turned to

3740.44 --> 3747.65
the god of money and not the God of

3743.48 --> 3752.42
healing the what's it called again the

3747.65 --> 3755.69
the oath do you know how the Hippocratic

3752.42 --> 3758.66
oath they stepped away from it in favor

3755.69 --> 3762.41
of making money and propelling in

3758.66 --> 3765.3199999999997
industry and yeah not everyone in it

3762.41 --> 3770.42
knows it as well but a lot of them do

3765.32 --> 3774.88
that I go very far with it like machine

3770.42 --> 3779.06
level psychopathic far even at points

3774.88 --> 3782.1800000000003
yeah yeah no no I'm laughing because I

3779.06 --> 3784.58
give you with yet it's like spawn no

3782.18 --> 3787.46
psychos I mean if you think about that

3784.58 --> 3789.7999999999997
right do you know what FF year if people

3787.46 --> 3792.7400000000002
actually stopped it's quite a scary

3789.8 --> 3795.4100000000003
concept more than bald about it but it's

3792.74 --> 3797.87
a quite scary concept that that these

3795.41 --> 3800.8399999999997
people that know that I saw are killing

3797.87 --> 3803.21
a you know without drugs that are

3800.84 --> 3806.71
administering to the population of the

3803.21 --> 3810.26
world is doing harm rate is actually

3806.71 --> 3812.42
doing harm and that the owner

3810.26 --> 3816.1400000000003
government's que nothing you know I mean

3812.42 --> 3818.51
that's kinda Joel others like our it's

3816.14 --> 3821.42
like good evidence it to prove that

3818.51 --> 3824.21
there has actually a vendetta against

3821.42 --> 3826.61
humanity for some people there's a good

3824.21 --> 3831.62
article in the Lakers well it's more

3826.61 --> 3834.5
likely commercial exploitation yeah but

3831.62 --> 3837.5299999999997
that's that's all that in that sense

3834.5 --> 3839.11
medically it's becoming almost like

3837.53 --> 3842.8700000000003
they're trading cattle

3839.11 --> 3845.09
yeah selling organs and getting as much

3842.87 --> 3847.43
functionality and money out of it as

3845.09 --> 3851.1800000000003
possible and minimum losses that kind of

3847.43 --> 3853.8799999999997
prioritizing so yeah people instead of

3851.18 --> 3856.1
just being focused as like you have to

3853.88 --> 3859.19
heal them and that's the only priority

3856.1 --> 3863.62
it becomes how do we minimize the losses

3859.19 --> 3867.1
and what could yield the most preferable

3863.62 --> 3869.93
results from all angles

3867.1 --> 3874.69
it's very exactly it's cold

3869.93 --> 3877.6099999999997
slowly yeah yep a a nicer thing and and

3874.69 --> 3878.0
the thing is for example thinking that's

3877.61 --> 3880.46
right

3878.0 --> 3885.62
what they do is is they steal the money

3880.46 --> 3888.14
off us and and then buy off a government

3885.62 --> 3890.0299999999997
stuff like that that allow them it's

3888.14 --> 3892.0699999999997
reading our company so we actually you

3890.03 --> 3895.2200000000003
know in a twist did we and I think this

3892.07 --> 3900.0800000000004
is what it came in quite a funny quite

3895.22 --> 3903.56
funny we are actually funding a our own

3900.08 --> 3905.66
destruction if for links for one have a

3903.56 --> 3907.19
bit of clean the fries because we are

3905.66 --> 3909.98
painting they're stealing they were in

3907.19 --> 3912.32
yeah we're funding that the death don't

3909.98 --> 3914.42
fall well you're selling a death trap

3912.32 --> 3917.21
and if we're then stupid and fall in

3914.42 --> 3922.07
that own death trap that we helped build

3917.21 --> 3924.26
yeah my father feels like me as well so

3922.07 --> 3926.1200000000003
yeah yeah but the thing is are when

3924.26 --> 3929.09
you've gotten lost and all these these

3926.12 --> 3931.46
people have created three it done you

3929.09 --> 3933.2000000000003
know even the people take saved to

3931.46 --> 3935.06
accept time they've created I mean this

3933.2 --> 3939.08
guy is a master they've got them they've

3935.06 --> 3941.45
had the best a master psychologist

3939.08 --> 3945.41
sociologist the far the best of these

3941.45 --> 3947.72
people to say like how can we do this

3945.41 --> 3949.0699999999997
and and these sociologists don't be gone

3947.72 --> 3951.5
all this is the best when all they are

3949.07 --> 3952.88
doing is writing a paper explaining from

3951.5 --> 3953.84
their heads in or thinking oh I'm gonna

3952.88 --> 3955.4
take over the world

3953.84 --> 3957.4700000000003
you know you know just right now let all

3955.4 --> 3959.4500000000003
they've been governor project not gonna

3957.47 --> 3961.52
right right what's the best way to get

3959.45 --> 3963.56
to run our society today they hand over

3961.52 --> 3965.36
these people to the people that give

3963.56 --> 3968.27
them the job to find out and they need

3965.36 --> 3971.21
implemented is here a and they gave the

3968.27 --> 3972.77
plans to so many also to implement you

3971.21 --> 3974.87
know in so it's like

3972.77 --> 3977.66
so even through the education system so

3974.87 --> 3978.5899999999997
I do you know I can't you know I don't

3977.66 --> 3980.96
blame us

3978.59 --> 3983.2400000000002
even though as us that's doing it and

3980.96 --> 3985.46
really contributing to it and

3983.24 --> 3987.95
everybody's doing it but we've gotta

3985.46 --> 3990.98
understand we've been conditioned to do

3987.95 --> 3993.29
that and it's hard to bring induction

3990.98 --> 3996.26
for a lot of people like the majority of

3993.29 --> 3999.11
people that don't even realize what the

3996.26 --> 4002.32
hell is going on Armen really you know

3999.11 --> 4004.63
reality struck down the alley beer and

4002.32 --> 4007.09
that story I just told you but I thought

4004.63 --> 4009.76
Percy be your counsel blah blah yeah I'm

4007.09 --> 4013.15
gonna I was still your what's made was

4009.76 --> 4018.3100000000004
very easy to live in a very comforting

4013.15 --> 4021.07
dream but yes very easy but yeah it's

4018.31 --> 4023.68
just a dream and if you keep on sitting

4021.07 --> 4026.9500000000003
in that dream and relying on that dream

4023.68 --> 4028.06
you're gonna walk into death traps it's

4026.95 --> 4032.41
gonna happen

4028.06 --> 4034.42
what do you realize it or not yeah I was

4032.41 --> 4037.18
always even thinking I was I was

4034.42 --> 4039.31
pondering are we it's a Michele really

4037.18 --> 4041.74
help and I was thinking I was wondering

4039.31 --> 4043.96
see when you're born you know what you

4041.74 --> 4046.39
want you may be one of the injections

4043.96 --> 4052.33
that you do get or something it's like

4046.39 --> 4055.18
ah it's like a biological a time bomb

4052.33 --> 4057.5499999999997
Tekin so it's it's caught so what it

4055.18 --> 4059.8599999999997
does is after so many years you know

4057.55 --> 4061.53
once you've you know done made your

4059.86 --> 4065.4
money and all that kinda stuff

4061.53 --> 4068.8300000000004
if other let me she know whatever is

4065.4 --> 4070.96
actually that last you have take me die

4068.83 --> 4073.93
nicely takes off if you don't get hit by

4070.96 --> 4076.66
a bus before but maybe you're injected

4073.93 --> 4078.7
and that thing's taken army just like a

4076.66 --> 4081.58
lot of them all through life so doesn't

4078.7 --> 4084.3999999999996
matter how much crap you eat or whatever

4081.58 --> 4087.67
it's already been decided they've

4084.4 --> 4091.08
discovered us this thing because you can

4087.67 --> 4094.15
you can get slaughtered a slow-release

4091.08 --> 4096.85
injections when they come out over a

4094.15 --> 4099.04
month they react over a month I'm sure

4096.85 --> 4101.049
they could do over a year or artemius or

4099.04 --> 4103.12
whatever I think you do you know mean so

4101.049 --> 4104.049
they put a nice little thing and then

4103.12 --> 4106.71
just see

4104.049 --> 4109.54
take monitor it's got a little I told me

4106.71 --> 4111.849
it's run off your Part B or whatever

4109.54 --> 4114.96
well whatever it takes I'm reading more

4111.849 --> 4118.029
fuel anyway and then he just goes bang

4114.96 --> 4121.839
legal you get canceled or whatever

4118.029 --> 4124.63
multiple sclerosis or disease but it's

4121.839 --> 4130.179
already stopped and Neil I don't know

4124.63 --> 4132.779
it's not beauty yeah that we're all over

4130.179 --> 4135.579
up in a program programmed world and

4132.779 --> 4139.779
then we have to from within being

4135.579 --> 4143.199
program to figure out that it is not

4139.779 --> 4147.67
yeah it's just there to give some kind

4143.199 --> 4150.579
of form with a lot of yeah distant

4147.67 --> 4154.9
control measures that are basically part

4150.579 --> 4158.679
of it the try and control how you think

4154.9 --> 4162.579
and grow up and what you're doing once

4158.679 --> 4166.42
you reach the top that's what it is is

4162.579 --> 4168.759
very difficult most people they don't

4166.42 --> 4172.02
get through it or once they figure out

4168.759 --> 4174.009
always all fake then they just corrupt

4172.02 --> 4176.650000000001
that happens too

4174.009 --> 4178.559
that's terrible it's like you know

4176.65 --> 4182.3189999999995

medical subjects I was good to to learn

4264.64 --> 4270.1900000000005
new things again biology medical things

4268.449 --> 4274.87
there's always something you've

4270.19 --> 4277.299999999999
overlooked twenty years I don't think

4274.87 --> 4279.46
I've ever heard about this or maybe I

4277.3 --> 4281.62
have and it just slipped away

4279.46 --> 4283.92
immediately because I was right in the

4281.62 --> 4286.57
middle of a lot of things that happens

4283.92 --> 4289.78
you you got confronted with something

4286.57 --> 4291.849999999999
while you're just applying your mind to

4289.78 --> 4296.44
figure certain things out that are in a

4291.85 --> 4298.929
different region and it just loop well

4296.44 --> 4300.82
in one year out of the other dudes what

4298.929 --> 4303.07
they say in the Netherlands and that

4300.82 --> 4305.62
happened so maybe I did hear this before

4303.07 --> 4308.28
but I just it slipped by so I'm very

4305.62 --> 4311.199
curious to see about this doctor

4308.28 --> 4313.84
unfortunately they died and his herbal

4311.199 --> 4315.58
cures very curious so oh by the way

4313.84 --> 4317.62

4343.57 --> 4349.87
to be such a smartass again I might

4346.66 --> 4351.67
actually recognize it from having seen

4349.87 --> 4353.7699999999995
it before I just explained that and it

4351.67 --> 4355.72
just slipped bys it's always good to be

4353.77 --> 4358.14
reminded of things that happen in the

4355.72 --> 4360.52
past because sometimes the slip past you

4358.14 --> 4362.950000000001
even though you did see it before but

4360.52 --> 4364.96
you just forgot it or it just didn't
