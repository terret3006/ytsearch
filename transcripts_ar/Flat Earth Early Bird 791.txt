all right so whether today is

94.159 --> 100.64
cloudy but it's actually

97.759 --> 103.04
kind of nice outside it's not really

100.64 --> 105.759
that cold

103.04 --> 107.36000000000001
it's a bit of a breeze but it's like

105.759 --> 114.96000000000001
this

107.36 --> 116.799
mild temperature

114.96 --> 118.83
yeah so it's actually kind of pleasant

116.799 --> 121.95
outside surprisingly

118.83 --> 121.95
[Music]

123.92 --> 129.84
but yeah there's not much sun coming

126.32 --> 129.84
through all that

136.4 --> 138.8
right

143.28 --> 152.08
hello everyone it's

146.319 --> 152.07999999999998
friday the 29th of january 2021.

152.48 --> 157.67999999999998
let's see who's in chat tara 306 was

155.519 --> 162.0
first

157.68 --> 162.0
and here we go again good to see you too

162.64 --> 174.77999999999997
all right

171.7 --> 174.78
[Music]

186.4 --> 190.87900000000002
i should be probably watching my own

188.72 --> 194.239
shows again

190.879 --> 196.56
i think i remember that before i started

194.239 --> 198.72
doing two hour shows i watch my own show

196.56 --> 201.84
a lot more often

198.72 --> 204.319
but now it's like pretty tough to find

201.84 --> 204.31900000000002
the time

208.159 --> 214.959
but yeah because

212.159 --> 215.44
in ways like two hour shows are pretty

214.959 --> 219.12
long

215.44 --> 222.239
and sometimes i really

219.12 --> 225.28
remember everything clearly

222.239 --> 226.08
when it's like very strong subject like

225.28 --> 227.68
that's very strong

226.08 --> 229.12
in me that i wish to share that i

227.68 --> 232.239
remember it

229.12 --> 232.239
but yeah when it's like

232.879 --> 237.28
a bit more spacious i tend to not

235.12 --> 240.48000000000002
remember as strong

237.28 --> 244.48
i'm noticing that about it myself a

240.48 --> 244.48
random explorer good to see you

250.959 --> 254.56
i'm off early today for exercise all

253.68 --> 258.799
right

254.56 --> 261.84
exercising is great especially

258.799 --> 261.84
during this period

262.24 --> 267.52
walking up to springtime having a lot of

265.68 --> 269.199
feel for it myself and

267.52 --> 270.71999999999997
i'm noticing by the way that i have

269.199 --> 273.28000000000003
impulses to kind of like

270.72 --> 273.28000000000003
work out

273.759 --> 279.36
i've been doing it only very sparingly

277.199 --> 280.32
besides just when i go out for grocery

279.36 --> 282.88
shopping

280.32 --> 285.52
because every time i go out i do it

282.88 --> 285.52
actively

288.08 --> 294.639
i never like hang on my bike try

291.12 --> 296.88
to get to my destination with as little

294.639 --> 300.32
effort as possible

296.88 --> 301.12
right a lot of people and myself in the

300.32 --> 304.24
past

301.12 --> 307.28000000000003
i've seen i see them

304.24 --> 309.36
and they're like that but every time i

307.28 --> 311.59999999999997
feel like that it's like no i gotta put

309.36 --> 313.199
i push myself i use my strictness to

311.6 --> 316.0
push myself to make it

313.199 --> 317.36
active anyway even though i don't really

316.0 --> 319.12
want to

317.36 --> 320.47900000000004
push myself out of it and that works

319.12 --> 323.039
really well for me

320.479 --> 325.199
so i've been doing it for a long time

323.039 --> 328.479
like that

325.199 --> 330.32
and yeah in my mind i've framed it as

328.479 --> 332.479
okay if i'm gonna do something i'm gonna

330.32 --> 335.759
do it actively everything

332.479 --> 338.24
that i do that is left to me

335.759 --> 339.68
of physical activity i turn it into

338.24 --> 342.08
sports

339.68 --> 342.96
because i need it for self maintenance

342.08 --> 344.71999999999997
that's basically

342.96 --> 347.19899999999996
a principle that i'm following for

344.72 --> 350.47900000000004
myself like that

347.199 --> 350.479
and it kind of works

351.36 --> 355.6
and i because of this by the way i

353.52 --> 358.96
always find an excuse to basically go

355.6 --> 361.44
out grocery shopping every single day

358.96 --> 363.919
because if i don't then i don't get my

361.44 --> 364.479
exercise like i don't even consciously

363.919 --> 366.56
know that

364.479 --> 369.36
it's just that my subconscious does

366.56 --> 371.6
realize that very clearly

369.36 --> 372.8
and then just says like no you gotta get

371.6 --> 374.72
something

372.8 --> 376.56
you don't have to feel foolish just

374.72 --> 378.96000000000004
forgetting one thing

376.56 --> 380.479
because secretly it's about just getting

378.96 --> 384.0
out there physically

380.479 --> 384.0
even if it's like bad weather

388.319 --> 396.40000000000003
yes here we go again i totally agree

394.08 --> 398.639
is good to hear that you're really doing

396.4 --> 403.44
your best to get out of that

398.639 --> 407.28000000000003
because well we we kind of been friends

403.44 --> 410.639
over chat over skype for a while now

407.28 --> 413.52
and i started to notice that you were

410.639 --> 414.16
displaying well behavior that correlates

413.52 --> 417.12
with

414.16 --> 419.36
staying locked up isolating yourself i

417.12 --> 422.72
recognize it because i've had it many

419.36 --> 425.039
many times in the past

422.72 --> 425.03900000000004
and

428.72 --> 433.759
yeah if you stay like that you become

430.96 --> 437.599
really moody and then

433.759 --> 441.68
that starts to rub off on everybody else

437.599 --> 444.639
it has a stick in the mud effect so

441.68 --> 445.599
i tried to address you a little bit

444.639 --> 448.319
about it

445.599 --> 448.319
the other day

448.72 --> 456.40000000000003
and i guess you took it to heart

453.28 --> 457.039
because in a way i don't tell people

456.4 --> 459.52
that

457.039 --> 461.12
because i want to leave them like to

459.52 --> 463.84
their own decision their own value

461.12 --> 465.919
for themselves to realize it and i'm

463.84 --> 466.63899999999995
kind of afraid to disturb it to hurt

465.919 --> 468.24
them

466.639 --> 472.0
so that's kind of why i've not been

468.24 --> 475.68
saying but i just noticed like

472.0 --> 478.0
this is not going somewhere else and you

475.68 --> 481.28000000000003
didn't seem to notice so maybe you did

478.0 --> 481.28
need somebody to tell you

481.759 --> 489.039
anyway glad to hear your

485.52 --> 491.039
yeah you're you're embracing it and

489.039 --> 494.56
trying to move on because that is very

491.039 --> 496.87899999999996
important it is what i talk about a lot

494.56 --> 500.16
about that moment like the moment of

496.879 --> 500.16
transition of decision

502.56 --> 507.84
to to go through because that's what it

504.96 --> 507.84
is

512.24 --> 516.399
but i'm sure it's gonna do you a lot of

514.159 --> 521.8389999999999
good

516.399 --> 524.0
physical exercise

521.839 --> 534.72
like really does kind of put you back

524.0 --> 536.959
into your body as my healer would say

534.72 --> 539.12
all right anyway eight eagle plane

536.959 --> 541.68
anchor good to see you

539.12 --> 541.68
and m

545.36 --> 554.48
right so yesterday i've been

549.76 --> 554.48
active endorphins too yeah yeah

554.959 --> 559.04
the flat earth debates was pretty good

557.85 --> 562.5600000000001
[Music]

559.04 --> 565.5999999999999
i was i think i was pretty active

562.56 --> 565.5999999999999
during the live show

566.56 --> 571.1199999999999
yeah i had some good moments can't wait

569.92 --> 574.24
to see it back because

571.12 --> 577.2
in a way you know when i'm doing it

574.24 --> 579.36
it's very hard to size up for me what is

577.2 --> 583.0400000000001
how the show is like

579.36 --> 585.2
because i'm really like doing that thing

583.04 --> 587.12
and my mind is constantly focused

585.2 --> 589.2
somewhere else always trying to

587.12 --> 591.519
my mind is more focused on puzzling

589.2 --> 594.32
things

591.519 --> 596.5600000000001
or analyzing the social dynamics of

594.32 --> 600.0
what's happening

596.56 --> 602.959
those types of things but

600.0 --> 603.2
yeah to then afterward watch it back as

602.959 --> 604.959
a

603.2 --> 607.44
and not as a participant not doing

604.959 --> 609.8389999999999
things but just viewing the whole thing

607.44 --> 610.5600000000001
like how is the show it's a totally

609.839 --> 613.839
different

610.56 --> 613.8389999999999
way of composing yourself

614.399 --> 618.079
and it's very interesting to see it back

617.76 --> 622.16
and

618.079 --> 625.4399999999999
also very weird for me to realize

622.16 --> 627.92
every time that when i hear myself back

625.44 --> 627.9200000000001
and all that

628.72 --> 635.6
like it's very different to watch

632.56 --> 639.279
than it was to do it and often

635.6 --> 643.36
i have a i don't know maybe it's like a

639.279 --> 643.36
down skill like i have a very

645.12 --> 648.24
strange ways of

651.12 --> 658.839
i think like what i think how it's like

654.48 --> 661.12
to others i often misjudge this i've

658.839 --> 663.519
noticed

661.12 --> 664.16
and maybe it's because of my mind's

663.519 --> 666.32
focus of

664.16 --> 669.279
how i do things that this just becomes

666.32 --> 669.279
very hard for me

673.12 --> 676.24
but then when i watch it back i re i can

675.279 --> 680.24
see much more

676.24 --> 680.24
how it really is and that's also

680.48 --> 684.24
why i should be kind of watching my own

682.48 --> 685.9200000000001
shows back when i've been kind of

684.24 --> 688.48
reluctant to

685.92 --> 689.92
because it's so long so i'm gonna put

688.48 --> 692.32
him in a bit of a dilemma i

689.92 --> 695.12
almost feeling like maybe i should just

692.32 --> 698.32
take it back to one hour

695.12 --> 701.68
but then again

698.32 --> 704.5600000000001
there have been signs that

701.68 --> 707.12
it is welcomed that i have a two-hour

704.56 --> 709.68
show and i can do it it's just

707.12 --> 711.36
this minor complication of that it

709.68 --> 713.5999999999999
becomes a little bit more difficult for

711.36 --> 716.24
me to watch it back especially like on a

713.6 --> 718.48
daily basis

716.24 --> 720.88
so yeah i'm still trying to figure that

718.48 --> 720.88
one out

723.2 --> 727.12
but yes letters debate yesterday was

724.959 --> 731.04
good

727.12 --> 734.079
hopefully it'll be good today as well

731.04 --> 737.1999999999999
right so

734.079 --> 740.7199999999999
anyway after that i i watched

737.2 --> 741.6
jaren who went live not sure when i came

740.72 --> 744.0
in

741.6 --> 744.72
like in the chat of dear life because i

744.0 --> 747.519
usually

744.72 --> 747.519
go in through there

749.68 --> 753.68
but it is interesting to sit sit there

752.56 --> 758.4799999999999
and at least

753.68 --> 762.7199999999999
like i'm not being

758.48 --> 765.9200000000001
i don't know there's no judgy moderator

762.72 --> 768.0790000000001
hanging over me there at least so that

765.92 --> 770.3199999999999
was good

768.079 --> 771.12
i just do what i always do like the same

770.32 --> 773.519
thing i would do

771.12 --> 774.399
over at patricia steers when she's going

773.519 --> 779.519
live

774.399 --> 779.519
it's just my form of chat commenting

780.32 --> 783.7600000000001
and i really appreciate being able to do

782.72 --> 788.639
that like

783.76 --> 788.639
it offers me a lot to be able to do that

788.72 --> 793.6800000000001
it gives me a specific type of mental

791.44 --> 797.12
freedom

793.68 --> 799.3599999999999
that's hard to attain in other forms

797.12 --> 800.9590000000001
and by the way requires your keyboard to

799.36 --> 803.2
work properly

800.959 --> 806.4799999999999
man and like three days ago my keyboard

803.2 --> 808.88
just had this sort of weird lock up

806.48 --> 810.16
where a whole range of keys just didn't

808.88 --> 813.92
really want to click

810.16 --> 815.12
they don't click they didn't want to

813.92 --> 818.079
register and it

815.12 --> 819.44
and agitating as hell but it's back to

818.079 --> 823.3599999999999
normal thank god

819.44 --> 826.72
so whatever that was it was temporary

823.36 --> 828.9590000000001
it's weird you know and this is a very

826.72 --> 832.72
old keyboard

828.959 --> 834.8
it's like 30 years old or something

832.72 --> 836.72
but it still works but it's sometimes

834.8 --> 841.279
just almost like humans

836.72 --> 842.72
has short moments of malfunction

841.279 --> 845.12
and then after a while it's back to

842.72 --> 845.12
normal

846.079 --> 850.079
yeah odd isn't it all right

851.519 --> 859.519
ah good teeth

856.56 --> 861.92
but yeah it was over jiren and they

859.519 --> 863.04
discussed a lot about christianity and

861.92 --> 864.959
also

863.04 --> 866.88
or at least that came up at some point

864.959 --> 867.5999999999999
and i just thought that was a good

866.88 --> 872.0
discussion

867.6 --> 875.1990000000001
about christianity about how a lot of

872.0 --> 875.839
christians like ecstatically i would add

875.199 --> 879.12
that word

875.839 --> 881.36
esoterically approach the story of

879.12 --> 885.76
christ and make it all about

881.36 --> 887.76
specific words and actions and systems

885.76 --> 888.8
that they kind of project onto the

887.76 --> 892.88
situation

888.8 --> 896.8389999999999
onto what they could what they learn

892.88 --> 898.8
and yeah they the guys in there

896.839 --> 902.32
reflected wisely

898.8 --> 914.399
i would say upon that giving

902.32 --> 916.0
agreeable insights so yeah

914.399 --> 918.8
that was pretty interest yeah it was

916.0 --> 921.12
pretty good to sit through

918.8 --> 921.12
uh

922.24 --> 925.839
pretty much watch it until the end also

924.399 --> 929.199
was like playing a

925.839 --> 929.1990000000001
game on the side of that

930.16 --> 933.4399999999999
and ended up the the day or rather the

932.72 --> 937.0400000000001
night

933.44 --> 941.6
with lift the veil who's been on about

937.04 --> 944.0
he's like kind of my new

941.6 --> 945.839
little max geyser in a way because he's

944.0 --> 946.88
just talking about crypto a lot and

945.839 --> 951.519
following

946.88 --> 953.68
market situations and business and yeah

951.519 --> 954.9590000000001
i used to follow max kaiser for that

953.68 --> 958.399
like

954.959 --> 960.079
up to a decade ago now he doesn't even

958.399 --> 961.92
have his own website anymore he's still

960.079 --> 964.16
active i think

961.92 --> 967.5999999999999
rt maybe i don't know what he's doing i

964.16 --> 969.8389999999999
haven't heard from him in a while

967.6 --> 969.839
uh

976.079 --> 982.4799999999999
but yeah there is this

979.279 --> 982.48
still rt right

983.92 --> 987.519
well there's some weird stock market

985.92 --> 991.12
activity going on

987.519 --> 997.36
so i've heard about people short selling

991.12 --> 1001.199
certain businesses in this case gamestop

997.36 --> 1001.1990000000001
so apparently that's happening now

1003.12 --> 1009.68
and personally i i don't even understand

1006.56 --> 1012.2399999999999
why short selling is allowed

1009.68 --> 1013.199
and well of course i do know because it

1012.24 --> 1016.32
is just an

1013.199 --> 1017.04
another convenient tool for people that

1016.32 --> 1019.1990000000001
has

1017.04 --> 1021.5999999999999
measured the situation with two measure

1019.199 --> 1021.5999999999999
sticks

1021.92 --> 1027.6789999999999
but for the hypocritic people that just

1025.28 --> 1030.959
want the option available

1027.679 --> 1031.3600000000001
right but in general like it's doesn't

1030.959 --> 1034.88
seem

1031.36 --> 1034.8799999999999
like it's a productive thing

1035.439 --> 1043.8390000000002
to bet on something crashing

1040.559 --> 1043.839
because of its influence

1044.959 --> 1049.3600000000001
right but anyway that happened and we'll

1047.12 --> 1051.36
see where that goes and

1049.36 --> 1053.28
getting rumors of that it's what that

1051.36 --> 1056.7199999999998
they want to try it with silver

1053.28 --> 1056.72
with them the best of luck

1056.82 --> 1060.01
[Music]

1062.64 --> 1067.8400000000001
yes chris la jambe i agree

1068.16 --> 1071.8400000000001
right so anyway that's going around

1073.039 --> 1080.4
did you syrian girls

1076.08 --> 1083.84
new one what

1080.4 --> 1084.72
a syrian girl did new video last one i

1083.84 --> 1089.36
saw was with

1084.72 --> 1089.3600000000001
paul joseph watson in

1092.84 --> 1095.84
2020

1096.16 --> 1101.52
but no i haven't seen any new videos of

1099.039 --> 1101.52
her yet

1102.0 --> 1106.559
like i haven't really followed rt in a

1104.32 --> 1106.559
while

1106.88 --> 1110.24
like they used to be really great in my

1109.6 --> 1113.76
opinion

1110.24 --> 1115.76
maybe i just didn't see it yet

1113.76 --> 1118.4
but eventually like i just started to

1115.76 --> 1119.76
notice like certain levels of propaganda

1118.4 --> 1123.8400000000001
in there

1119.76 --> 1123.84
that really rubbed me the wrong way

1124.32 --> 1129.6
and i kind of felt that i just didn't

1127.28 --> 1132.799
like them anymore

1129.6 --> 1135.4399999999998
but i don't know what has happened since

1132.799 --> 1139.039
maybe i should keep yeah check it out

1135.44 --> 1139.039
again on a more regular basis

1142.72 --> 1151.679
there's a new one on this exact subject

1145.6 --> 1153.36
all right

1151.679 --> 1156.0800000000002
anyway i got my information from

1153.36 --> 1156.08
lyftville

1163.52 --> 1167.36
all right also this morning before the

1165.679 --> 1170.24
show i kind of watched a bit of

1167.36 --> 1170.24
over benjamin

1171.679 --> 1178.16
oh that's short upload

1175.12 --> 1180.4799999999998
i didn't completely finish it but

1178.16 --> 1181.52
also yeah a reflection to all this and

1180.48 --> 1184.88
it's just like yeah

1181.52 --> 1188.559
look at all the milk i produce

1184.88 --> 1191.0390000000002
i got milk like yeah you got

1188.559 --> 1192.72
short options and money and virtual

1191.039 --> 1195.2
stuff and

1192.72 --> 1195.919
swings you don't really know what you

1195.2 --> 1199.2
got

1195.919 --> 1207.8400000000001
do you have anything i got milk

1199.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
so that was like a very obvious choice

1217.2 --> 1221.039
but it's funny though you know in a way

1219.6 --> 1222.7199999999998
in my mind i've been kind of

1221.039 --> 1226.0
like trying to figure out what it would

1222.72 --> 1227.919
be like to live like that

1226.0 --> 1229.44
and my problem would be that i would

1227.919 --> 1231.679
have so much

1229.44 --> 1233.679
like too much what do you do with all

1231.679 --> 1236.96
that

1233.679 --> 1239.919
production that would be my

1236.96 --> 1240.64
main problem not even like making it all

1239.919 --> 1242.5590000000002
work

1240.64 --> 1246.159
and doing the work but rather like what

1242.559 --> 1249.44
the hell do i do with all this stuff

1246.159 --> 1252.4
all the milk and all the

1249.44 --> 1255.28
because usually when you produce you

1252.4 --> 1255.2800000000002
produce a lot

1255.919 --> 1260.8400000000001
like if it would just be me just me on

1258.48 --> 1262.64
my own

1260.84 --> 1264.799
i i'd

1262.64 --> 1266.96
completely just get stuck at some point

1264.799 --> 1269.679
i know i would

1266.96 --> 1270.88
i definitely needed would need a partner

1269.679 --> 1274.0800000000002
with that

1270.88 --> 1275.6000000000001
and yeah in a way i thought that my ex

1274.08 --> 1279.12
was gonna be that

1275.6 --> 1282.0
because she didn't have the

1279.12 --> 1282.6399999999999
impulse and all yeah now me again uh

1282.0 --> 1286.159
yeah

1282.64 --> 1291.8400000000001
i had it i almost had it all yeah

1286.159 --> 1291.8400000000001
which means i don't i know

1293.08 --> 1298.799
[Music]

1294.24 --> 1300.96
it's just that in ways

1298.799 --> 1302.84
getting a little dramatic don't get

1300.96 --> 1305.919
stuck up on them

1302.84 --> 1308.0
like something

1305.919 --> 1310.24
really big and good could have happened

1308.0 --> 1313.12
if the circumstances were right for it

1310.24 --> 1316.159
and i didn't even fully understand yet

1313.12 --> 1319.36
with my ex that could have worked out i

1316.159 --> 1323.7600000000002
didn't even fully understand yet

1319.36 --> 1324.3999999999999
why but now with who i am now looking

1323.76 --> 1327.679
back

1324.4 --> 1329.919
i just realized like oh my god damn it

1327.679 --> 1331.679
if that worked i would have been even

1329.919 --> 1334.0
better than i could have foreseen

1331.679 --> 1336.159
right that sort of [ __ ] is happening to

1334.0 --> 1336.159
me

1338.159 --> 1342.64
and i really wish i could have just

1339.76 --> 1345.2
figured out in some way like

1342.64 --> 1346.0800000000002
how could i have prevented that thing

1345.2 --> 1350.0800000000002
from crashing

1346.08 --> 1350.08
and also like what were the typical

1350.559 --> 1355.44
daily issues what became like what was

1354.08 --> 1358.1589999999999
the demeanor

1355.44 --> 1360.0
with me like demeanor like how do you

1358.159 --> 1361.8400000000001
compose yourself towards somebody

1360.0 --> 1363.2
else in their presence like what do you

1361.84 --> 1367.52
do

1363.2 --> 1370.0
like this is not so automated for me

1367.52 --> 1371.44
and it makes me feel a lot like a real

1370.0 --> 1373.36
outsider

1371.44 --> 1376.3200000000002
in the face of other people that just a

1373.36 --> 1379.28
lot of people just do

1376.32 --> 1380.8799999999999
they go by recognition they recognize

1379.28 --> 1384.72
something that they think they can latch

1380.88 --> 1384.72
on to respond to and then they just go

1387.12 --> 1393.84
in the time period where i

1390.24 --> 1397.0
try to learn to do that the

1393.84 --> 1400.1589999999999
the things that i took as part of my

1397.0 --> 1404.64
experimental social self

1400.159 --> 1408.48
it really turned into a disaster

1404.64 --> 1411.5200000000002
and that's yeah in response

1408.48 --> 1412.159
like basically it was kind of shame of

1411.52 --> 1415.52
all those

1412.159 --> 1418.72
failures that really pushed me

1415.52 --> 1422.24
into becoming like a hermit

1418.72 --> 1425.76
sounds really bad when i say it just

1422.24 --> 1425.76
like that but that is what it is

1428.799 --> 1433.039
so for me it's really like

1431.65 --> 1435.039
[Music]

1433.039 --> 1436.4
composure how do you do it and it's

1435.039 --> 1439.6
weird because

1436.4 --> 1444.0
when i'm for example making

1439.6 --> 1447.039
characters in a story or in a game

1444.0 --> 1447.6
then it's so easy to give them like this

1447.039 --> 1449.679
purpose

1447.6 --> 1451.1999999999998
and the way to compose themselves in

1449.679 --> 1454.48
situations

1451.2 --> 1454.88
that i learned from myself it's just

1454.48 --> 1459.84
that

1454.88 --> 1459.8400000000001
when it's me

1460.24 --> 1468.0
the pick is not so easy cause

1464.24 --> 1470.559
well i don't know what i am like i don't

1468.0 --> 1472.88
have a role for myself

1470.559 --> 1476.1589999999999
does that make any sense maybe i'm

1472.88 --> 1478.0800000000002
getting really introspective now

1476.159 --> 1479.8400000000001
i don't have like a social role for

1478.08 --> 1481.4399999999998
myself i don't know how to compose

1479.84 --> 1487.84
myself

1481.44 --> 1487.8400000000001
with what i got

1504.32 --> 1509.76
and maybe that is also what

1507.6 --> 1512.1589999999999
like part of that and the honesty that

1509.76 --> 1515.76
makes you guys think like yeah that's

1512.159 --> 1521.2
just our win right that's just how arwen

1515.76 --> 1523.76
is is that it is that how it feels

1521.2 --> 1525.52
is there some kind of sensibility to it

1523.76 --> 1527.279
or is there some kind of distinct

1525.52 --> 1529.6
asymmetry

1527.279 --> 1530.32
like i'm really trying to freaking

1529.6 --> 1532.9599999999998
identify

1530.32 --> 1532.96
myself here

1533.84 --> 1539.4399999999998
and some feedback would be really nice

1537.2 --> 1541.3600000000001
and i don't mean like oh you i need

1539.44 --> 1544.48
support i need

1541.36 --> 1548.24
a warm heart like yeah we agree no i

1544.48 --> 1548.24
i really need like this

1549.36 --> 1557.84
information i need

1552.72 --> 1557.84
like analytical information

1559.36 --> 1571.84
and the chat goes silent yay

1573.59 --> 1576.6799999999998
[Music]

1582.84 --> 1585.84
do

1591.279 --> 1595.76
so no feedback whatsoever

1596.24 --> 1601.919
i mean i gave you basically a dichotomy

1598.64 --> 1601.919
to choose from at least

1609.44 --> 1613.919
or is this some kind of weird spiritual

1611.919 --> 1616.3200000000002
unspoken time where everybody

1613.919 --> 1618.0800000000002
like subconsciously knows oh no no this

1616.32 --> 1619.6
is when we have to step away

1618.08 --> 1621.84
this is when we have to step away

1619.6 --> 1624.0
because this is irwin's personal thing

1621.84 --> 1626.1589999999999
we can't give him this information for

1624.0 --> 1629.84
some mysterious reason why does nobody

1626.159 --> 1629.8400000000001
ever freaking just answer

1631.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
for crying out loud

1642.0 --> 1645.76
am i asking the wrong question

1648.96 --> 1652.08
is there anybody still left here in the

1651.039 --> 1655.84
chat

1652.08 --> 1655.84
is this too early for you

1666.0 --> 1670.0
i mean there's 90 people 19 people

1669.36 --> 1672.1589999999999
watching

1670.0 --> 1672.159
so

1673.2 --> 1677.2
what am i talking about oh there you go

1680.84 --> 1683.84
see

1692.48 --> 1698.72
trying to stay warm by the fire oh

1694.32 --> 1702.4399999999998
that's nice just got here right

1698.72 --> 1705.44
now i've just been trying to get some

1702.44 --> 1709.52
psychoanalytic feedback

1705.44 --> 1711.3600000000001
concerning my composure demeanor

1709.52 --> 1715.039
not just what i'm trying to do but also

1711.36 --> 1715.039
like what is my social role

1718.64 --> 1722.0800000000002
and describing basically a weakness on

1721.2 --> 1724.72
my part

1722.08 --> 1727.6789999999999
that i like i recognize that is

1724.72 --> 1731.1200000000001
definitely a weakness and i described it

1727.679 --> 1734.48
like the history of it in a way

1731.12 --> 1735.84
what it's like what it does i can't

1734.48 --> 1738.559
repeat it all again

1735.84 --> 1739.279
like i pretty much just talked about it

1738.559 --> 1742.6399999999999
for

1739.279 --> 1742.64
20 minutes or something

1750.32 --> 1754.399
i need a new hairstyle what the

1761.12 --> 1767.84
what's wrong with my hairstyle

1768.24 --> 1773.36
i mean my hair is anything but perfect

1770.64 --> 1773.3600000000001
but it still

1774.559 --> 1778.399
should be fine it's a little messy you

1777.52 --> 1781.6
know

1778.399 --> 1782.32
especially when i start doing things

1781.6 --> 1786.32

live on air messing with my own hair

1786.48 --> 1795.84

1889.919 --> 1893.8400000000001
i mean we'll see

1897.84 --> 1901.519
i think technically he should be

1903.36 --> 1910.08
we'll see what happens

1906.48 --> 1910.08
what yeah what they got planned

1911.679 --> 1921.8400000000001
what cards are left

1932.84 --> 1935.84
um

1959.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
alright timing him out

1965.36 --> 1969.84
what oh my god dude

1970.88 --> 1977.8400000000001
don't know yeah

1988.0 --> 1992.399
right yet technically today it might get

1990.64 --> 1996.0
a little messy

1992.399 --> 1998.0
because i basically unblocked everything

1996.0 --> 2000.399
and everyone

1998.0 --> 2001.76
so it's a clean slate and i'm doing it

2000.399 --> 2004.9599999999998
just to

2001.76 --> 2010.1589999999999
throw a lot of old and probably

2004.96 --> 2012.24
deleted socks out of there or inactives

2010.159 --> 2014.159
and just give a lot of people a new

2012.24 --> 2017.1200000000001
chance and then i'm not going to pick

2014.159 --> 2018.96
out one by one picking niels out of

2017.12 --> 2019.9189999999999
haystack it's a really annoying thing

2018.96 --> 2023.76
it's just that

2019.919 --> 2023.76
currently i don't have anybody

2023.919 --> 2027.6000000000001
banned from my chat let's just say it

2025.84 --> 2030.32
like that

2027.6 --> 2030.7199999999998
but i'm sure they'll all be coming back

2030.32 --> 2033.2
and

2030.72 --> 2033.919
they'll all push me to ban them again

2033.2 --> 2036.96
because it's

2033.919 --> 2037.679
definitely not i'm not gonna not ban

2036.96 --> 2040.72
anyone

2037.679 --> 2040.72
absolutely i will

2042.96 --> 2048.559
but i just had to do some spring

2044.799 --> 2048.559
cleaning early spring cleaning

2049.04 --> 2061.839
get all the old dead socks out of there

2071.919 --> 2079.169
so we'll see who is gonna pop by

2075.679 --> 2079.169
[Music]

2080.56 --> 2089.839
ah hello indie fransen it's been a while

2100.839 --> 2103.839
so

2105.599 --> 2117.839
hello there wes watson good to see you

2118.75 --> 2122.539
[Music]

2125.79 --> 2128.949
[Music]

2164.16 --> 2173.839
right so i went through

2168.64 --> 2173.839
it all

2175.52 --> 2181.44
so is there anything particular any of

2178.64 --> 2187.839
you would like me to address

2181.44 --> 2187.839
or explain because i'm up for anything

2190.16 --> 2195.359
oh wait yeah

2196.56 --> 2203.119
i had an interesting new celestials yeah

2199.52 --> 2203.119
sort of celestial sighting

2203.76 --> 2215.8390000000004
like solar wise some guy

2208.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
found this video

2225.119 --> 2231.52
just post a link

2228.32 --> 2236.2400000000002
that's really fascinating

2231.52 --> 2240.16
because yeah it's like the sun goes down

2236.24 --> 2241.68
and then yeah something weird happens

2240.16 --> 2244.48
there's like this virtual

2241.68 --> 2246.3999999999996
light beam like way afterward that just

2244.48 --> 2249.599
goes around

2246.4 --> 2253.119
almost like a like a beacon

2249.599 --> 2253.119
it's really bizarre

2254.4 --> 2260.56
but like it's very distinct very and

2257.119 --> 2260.56
yeah very fascinating

2261.04 --> 2267.599
so like yeah mysterious phenomena so

2264.4 --> 2267.599
that's your phenomenon

2268.64 --> 2271.839
what is that beam

2273.28 --> 2277.92
like i yeah i might just show it

2276.079 --> 2278.96
although yeah i'm afraid i would be

2277.92 --> 2282.4
stealing it

2278.96 --> 2286.32
or anything but just

2282.4 --> 2286.32
show us short snippet of it

2286.8 --> 2289.04
see

2291.04 --> 2299.839
without sound though just to show it

2294.8 --> 2299.8390000000004
right so let's see

2301.76 --> 2305.5200000000004
all right there you go see that

2308.72 --> 2315.839
so this is time lapse

2312.32 --> 2318.48
sun goes down and then

2315.839 --> 2318.48
on the right

2319.839 --> 2331.599
see that

2326.8 --> 2331.599
let's see if we can get that a little

2338.839 --> 2341.839
better

2352.839 --> 2356.64
there

2354.0 --> 2358.88
yeah then goes through all kinds of

2356.64 --> 2362.0
other

2358.88 --> 2364.8
views but

2362.0 --> 2366.4
that's just like a beam it's like this

2364.8 --> 2369.8390000000004
orange red beam

2366.4 --> 2369.839
wasn't that bizarre

2372.24 --> 2375.359
so that was interesting

2381.359 --> 2388.72
is it the gases what are some what

2385.599 --> 2390.4
no it was light this is the light what

2388.72 --> 2397.839
are you talking about here we go again

2390.4 --> 2397.839
come on

2430.72 --> 2441.9199999999996
gas is being lit

2438.56 --> 2445.2
well you basically

2441.92 --> 2447.119
the light yeah you see that beam because

2445.2 --> 2450.0
it is lighting up things so

2447.119 --> 2451.6800000000003
it would be like the moist in the air

2450.0 --> 2456.4
the cloudishness

2451.68 --> 2456.3999999999996
whatever is over there yes

2458.079 --> 2466.2400000000002
it is being lit up by that beam that's

2460.8 --> 2467.6800000000003
what you saw

2466.24 --> 2469.7599999999998
there's a flare before the sun

2467.68 --> 2472.16
disappears yeah that's that that's

2469.76 --> 2472.1600000000003
different

2478.72 --> 2495.839
hello rufus saint hubbins

2518.16 --> 2521.239
[Music]

2534.839 --> 2537.839
uh

2548.839 --> 2551.839
so

2554.96 --> 2561.04
okay let's see if i can dig something up

2557.599 --> 2561.04
because this chat is

2561.599 --> 2569.52
the worst i had

2565.839 --> 2574.0789999999997
in a month literally nothing

2569.52 --> 2579.839
coming from there let's see

2574.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
what i can dig up

2590.839 --> 2593.839
uh

2598.12 --> 2601.2599999999998
[Music]

2619.76 --> 2622.079
hmm

2628.48 --> 2635.839
all right i'm watching through rt right

2632.839 --> 2635.839
now

2658.56 --> 2663.839
[Music]

2660.64 --> 2663.839
all right

2702.839 --> 2707.599
hmm

2704.079 --> 2707.599
right oh yeah i almost forgot

2708.4 --> 2713.119
because i shared this two in chat

2710.56 --> 2713.119
yesterday

2714.0 --> 2718.72
like alex jones had this interview with

2717.839 --> 2720.72
well

2718.72 --> 2722.9599999999996
it was kind of weird though but it's

2720.72 --> 2725.2
interesting

2722.96 --> 2726.4
to keep in mind and then keep reflecting

2725.2 --> 2728.72
on what that meant

2726.4 --> 2730.48
all of that as time progresses and

2728.72 --> 2734.48
things unfold

2730.48 --> 2738.0
what yeah he had some uh boogaloo

2734.48 --> 2742.2400000000002
leader he would point at him as a leader

2738.0 --> 2746.56
basically on and yeah it's like

2742.24 --> 2747.4399999999996
pretty difficult to yeah perfectly

2746.56 --> 2749.92
figure out

2747.44 --> 2751.68
what is happening there i had a bit of

2749.92 --> 2754.96
difficulty with it

2751.68 --> 2756.7999999999997
because i thought that

2754.96 --> 2758.64
well i'm not even going to expand too

2756.8 --> 2760.0
much on it because i just don't know

2758.64 --> 2762.24
anymore it's

2760.0 --> 2762.24
like

2763.2 --> 2767.52
like those guys or the principles or

2765.68 --> 2770.3999999999996
what it's supposed to be

2767.52 --> 2775.599
that sounded really pretty good just

2770.4 --> 2778.7200000000003
very defiant

2775.599 --> 2781.76
but at the same time

2778.72 --> 2784.7999999999997
it's like yeah is it all is it

2781.76 --> 2787.28
is it safe or is it staving off

2784.8 --> 2789.6800000000003
towards like a disaster situation and

2787.28 --> 2791.6800000000003
like what do you do with

2789.68 --> 2793.52
but it was just interesting that

2791.68 --> 2796.72
interview so i posted that

2793.52 --> 2803.839
in the chat of

2796.72 --> 2803.839
skype earlier chat

2810.64 --> 2815.44
i guess i'll post it over here too if

2812.96 --> 2817.359
people want to see it

2815.44 --> 2820.319
yeah if you want to know this specific

2817.359 --> 2824.4
booloo interview

2820.319 --> 2826.24
then watch after 50 minutes

2824.4 --> 2828.8
because there's yeah there's a whole lot

2826.24 --> 2832.4799999999996
of other stuff before that

2828.8 --> 2835.6800000000003
skit about wearing

2832.48 --> 2839.04
multiple masks like yeah

2835.68 --> 2842.16
it is kind of funny and sad

2839.04 --> 2843.04
but yeah anyway that so now you got it

2842.16 --> 2845.839
all

2843.04 --> 2845.839
this is

2847.2 --> 2852.64
what i've grabbed together off the

2856.839 --> 2859.839
internet

2862.079 --> 2873.8390000000004
right there

2878.96 --> 2887.839
is that did you change your account name

2883.28 --> 2887.8390000000004
point each

2893.22 --> 2896.45
[Music]

2914.24 --> 2918.0
cooking chat you have a cooking channel

2926.839 --> 2929.839
what

2931.52 --> 2946.88
okay here we go again that's okay

2943.839 --> 2957.839
right okay fine

2946.88 --> 2957.839
point it you do whatever you like

2962.079 --> 2967.6800000000003
full moon now in dallas

2965.28 --> 2967.6800000000003
is it

2968.319 --> 2985.839
i can't see the moon right now but yeah

2970.4 --> 2985.839
that's because there's clouds everywhere

3005.65 --> 3009.419
[Music]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
so

3038.88 --> 3041.839
what's this

3052.079 --> 3058.4
all right yeah i should share this too

3055.28 --> 3061.0400000000004
like a flat side made a good video

3058.4 --> 3061.04
but uh

3062.0 --> 3070.64
yeah resolution limit

3065.68 --> 3073.9199999999996
situation just a demonstration video

3070.64 --> 3077.1189999999997
it's pretty good check it out

3073.92 --> 3080.559
to just prove that if yeah the

3077.119 --> 3083.839
not the optical slant effect effectively

3080.559 --> 3085.119
that's how i called it and he

3083.839 --> 3088.4
demonstrate that

3085.119 --> 3097.839
how like even colors can just

3088.4 --> 3097.839
be completely compressed away

3105.68 --> 3110.48
they turn on the chemtrail plane

3108.079 --> 3112.8
yesterday big time where was that david

3110.48 --> 3125.839
blackson

3112.8 --> 3125.8390000000004
hello my thighs

3131.359 --> 3139.839
dallas all right okay

3143.15 --> 3146.34
[Music]

3150.839 --> 3155.46
so

3152.27 --> 3155.46
[Music]

3155.599 --> 3160.8
right yeah i don't know what they spray

3157.68 --> 3160.7999999999997
over there in the u.s

3163.119 --> 3166.559
i really don't know but whenever they're

3165.92 --> 3168.559
spraying

3166.559 --> 3170.2400000000002
over here and sometimes they do think

3168.559 --> 3172.4
they do do that

3170.24 --> 3174.9599999999996
they do leave stuff behind that's just

3172.4 --> 3180.64
not moist

3174.96 --> 3183.68
i don't know what it is though

3180.64 --> 3186.24
i'm not certain it's like chemicals

3183.68 --> 3186.8799999999997
like that i don't know i i don't know i

3186.24 --> 3190.0789999999997
tend to

3186.88 --> 3190.88
think it's not that because that sort of

3190.079 --> 3194.559
thing

3190.88 --> 3198.2400000000002
has been happening out here

3194.559 --> 3200.6400000000003
well for over two decades and

3198.24 --> 3201.9199999999996
well maybe at certain points there was

3200.64 --> 3205.839
like in a

3201.92 --> 3205.839
like it could have been like a chemtrail

3206.16 --> 3211.2799999999997
but in retrospect analyzing that i could

3209.92 --> 3213.52
have just been

3211.28 --> 3215.0400000000004
having seen that and then associated

3213.52 --> 3216.079
something that happened that came from

3215.04 --> 3218.4
something else

3216.079 --> 3219.92
with it like the smell of something like

3218.4 --> 3221.92
some chemical in here

3219.92 --> 3224.2400000000002
well maybe it wasn't because of the

3221.92 --> 3227.839
chemtrails maybe it was because of some

3224.24 --> 3227.839
chemical plant in the distance

3228.48 --> 3232.079
whatever something like that

3232.8 --> 3239.76
so i've never been able to directly

3236.079 --> 3243.44
tie in any kind of chemicals

3239.76 --> 3251.599
with the trails but it's not just

3243.44 --> 3254.079
moist and gases

3251.599 --> 3254.7200000000003
because of just the nature of yeah that

3254.079 --> 3258.2400000000002
it

3254.72 --> 3258.24
stays lingering and then

3259.04 --> 3268.24
um waves out like a feather

3262.96 --> 3268.2400000000002
that if it was just gases and

3269.04 --> 3273.2
and water it wouldn't do that

3275.359 --> 3280.24
so they're doing something with it

3278.48 --> 3282.64
but i've even reasoned out like what if

3280.24 --> 3285.7599999999998
they just spray

3282.64 --> 3285.7599999999998
little bits of dust

3285.839 --> 3289.52
just regular dust sand dust or whatever

3288.24 --> 3291.04
to

3289.52 --> 3293.2
have some kind of influence on the

3291.04 --> 3296.799
weather and it's just basic weather

3293.2 --> 3300.799
modification they sneak in there

3296.799 --> 3304.4
right but that's just my sizing up of it

3300.799 --> 3305.7599999999998
here in the netherlands i don't i don't

3304.4 --> 3308.64
have any experience with

3305.76 --> 3310.88
chemtrails in the united states so maybe

3308.64 --> 3312.0
it's a whole different game over there i

3310.88 --> 3315.599
don't

3312.0 --> 3318.559
know no way

3315.599 --> 3318.96
to know for me right now i'd have to be

3318.559 --> 3322.079
there

3318.96 --> 3322.079
and experience it

3325.76 --> 3331.3590000000004
but yeah i've heard from several people

3327.839 --> 3333.359
that at least like in california areas

3331.359 --> 3334.4
it really does seem like they spray

3333.359 --> 3339.119
chemicals

3334.4 --> 3341.52
so it said can't confirm that either but

3339.119 --> 3341.52
it's just

3343.44 --> 3349.839
pretty strong correlations let's just

3346.72 --> 3349.839
say it like that

3350.319 --> 3354.079
but again like i think that the

3351.68 --> 3357.44
chemtrails whatever that is

3354.079 --> 3360.559
it's not universal it's not everybody

3357.44 --> 3377.839
every region it's dealt it's the

3360.559 --> 3377.8390000000004
the same thing is done i don't think so

3378.96 --> 3382.48
okay guns have never run rmp well i

3380.72 --> 3385.7599999999998
didn't say i didn't believe in

3382.48 --> 3389.68
chemtrails i'm just saying that

3385.76 --> 3393.3590000000004
it's not like universal

3389.68 --> 3394.5589999999997
terrible poison like i don't think

3393.359 --> 3396.5589999999997
that's happening because the

3394.559 --> 3399.2000000000003
consequences would be absolutely

3396.559 --> 3399.2000000000003
palpable

3402.559 --> 3406.48
now in some areas it might actually be

3405.119 --> 3408.7200000000003
palpable

3406.48 --> 3410.72
over here it just doesn't seem like it

3408.72 --> 3414.0
if there was poison

3410.72 --> 3416.8799999999997
then like

3414.0 --> 3418.0
the soil and the water quality which is

3416.88 --> 3420.88
very strictly

3418.0 --> 3422.319
measured here for pollutants in the

3420.88 --> 3424.079
netherlands i know that there's like

3422.319 --> 3426.96
entire institutes that do that

3424.079 --> 3427.52
they would they would report on it it's

3426.96 --> 3430.48
like yeah

3427.52 --> 3433.839
if there's this poison stacking up and

3430.48 --> 3433.839
they're not

3433.92 --> 3437.2000000000003
because yeah those types of chemicals as

3436.72 --> 3441.2
even

3437.2 --> 3442.24
said through chemtrail conspiracy

3441.2 --> 3443.9199999999996
documentaries

3442.24 --> 3445.359
yeah those chemicals would have a

3443.92 --> 3448.079
detrimental influence

3445.359 --> 3449.5989999999997
sizeable so if that's constantly

3448.079 --> 3452.079
happening

3449.599 --> 3454.1600000000003
that would be palpable now in the u.s

3452.079 --> 3455.92
that might be that there's

3454.16 --> 3457.68
places where that is absolutely

3455.92 --> 3460.64
happening all the time

3457.68 --> 3462.0789999999997
and like nature is all dying everywhere

3460.64 --> 3474.8799999999997
not over here

3462.079 --> 3478.48
that's all i'm saying

3474.88 --> 3479.7200000000003
well chemtrails are well even

3478.48 --> 3482.079
well you could consider that

3479.72 --> 3482.5589999999997
geoengineering like that covering up the

3482.079 --> 3488.1600000000003
sky

3482.559 --> 3491.3590000000004
against the sun is not good

3488.16 --> 3493.359
unless they have a very specific careful

3491.359 --> 3494.799
maneuvering system where they for

3493.359 --> 3497.359
example

3494.799 --> 3498.72
plan in to bring more moist in the air

3497.359 --> 3503.839
or something you know that's

3498.72 --> 3503.839
that is weather engineering

3505.76 --> 3509.119
so it doesn't necessarily have to be bad

3508.72 --> 3513.2
right

3509.119 --> 3516.2400000000002
it could be just weather control but

3513.2 --> 3518.64
yeah they would have to

3516.24 --> 3520.0
have that designation that function

3518.64 --> 3522.4
taken on

3520.0 --> 3524.4
to do that that doesn't necessarily have

3522.4 --> 3524.799
to be the case they can just use it to

3524.4 --> 3528.88
just

3524.799 --> 3531.7599999999998
spray [ __ ] whatever they plan

3528.88 --> 3534.0
with whatever reason depending on who is

3531.76 --> 3545.8390000000004
in control of

3534.0 --> 3545.839
that process in that region

3556.839 --> 3559.839
so

3583.2 --> 3587.4399999999996
yeah well here we go again yeah i've

3584.88 --> 3590.1600000000003
heard of it i i know the line

3587.44 --> 3590.16
aluminium

3590.559 --> 3598.1600000000003
strontium barium yeah and more stuff

3594.0 --> 3601.52
fungi and all that i remember that

3598.16 --> 3606.3999999999996
but the thing is there is no

3601.52 --> 3609.599
sizable pollution in everything of that

3606.4 --> 3614.1600000000003
because that would appear in absolutely

3609.599 --> 3617.44
everything then

3614.16 --> 3620.16
in agriculture in

3617.44 --> 3622.079
animals in the meat we eat yeah that

3620.16 --> 3624.319
shit's gonna pile up everything if it

3622.079 --> 3626.96
is actually literally being sprayed like

3624.319 --> 3631.359
that constantly

3626.96 --> 3632.079
so is it is there a particular pollution

3631.359 --> 3635.52
of this

3632.079 --> 3638.079
everywhere or could it be

3635.52 --> 3639.52
that these things are delivered only

3638.079 --> 3642.6400000000003
specific

3639.52 --> 3644.319
in specific regions or that it might

3642.64 --> 3645.7599999999998
actually not be coming through

3644.319 --> 3648.799
chemtrails but

3645.76 --> 3657.8390000000004
in some other fashion that's being

3648.799 --> 3657.839
kept secret right

3680.4 --> 3687.839
no audio

3685.599 --> 3690.4
well that's that's on your side then

3687.839 --> 3690.4
guns never

3694.68 --> 3699.839

3726.16 --> 3729.839
all right see you later here we go again

3730.0 --> 3733.599
yeah have fun out there

3735.44 --> 3741.839
see you next time

3763.76 --> 3766.9790000000003
[Music]

3771.839 --> 3778.24
yes small thighs i know yeah but

3774.96 --> 3779.2
that is like a general thing that they

3778.24 --> 3781.1189999999997
can do

3779.2 --> 3782.48
through geo engineering is basically

3781.119 --> 3786.4
covering up

3782.48 --> 3787.28
the sunlight and that'll cool things

3786.4 --> 3791.92
down

3787.28 --> 3791.92
so yes that is a basic geoengineering

3794.839 --> 3797.839
tactic

3811.15 --> 3816.2290000000003
[Music]

3822.839 --> 3825.839
do

3830.24 --> 3833.4399999999996
oh it's tiny one more gun i don't know i

3832.16 --> 3836.5589999999997
haven't seen him around

3833.44 --> 3838.559
i don't know what's going on maybe like

3836.559 --> 3839.6800000000003
he said yesterday he was just going to

3838.559 --> 3842.96
go

3839.68 --> 3846.72
if i was not going to be

3842.96 --> 3850.079
tolerant of him taking the vaccine

3846.72 --> 3852.16
right he seemed to be very persistent

3850.079 --> 3857.3590000000004
about it

3852.16 --> 3857.359
so i look if if that's it that's it

3864.839 --> 3867.92
fine

3866.0 --> 3880.96
thought it's absolutely absurd that he

3867.92 --> 3884.079
would do that

3880.96 --> 3885.039
yes i heard of that david blackson like

3884.079 --> 3895.8390000000004
seriously who

3885.039 --> 3895.8390000000004
cares about that nonsense

3912.16 --> 3916.5589999999997
huh yes guns have never on rmp yeah yeah

3915.92 --> 3919.44
i know

3916.559 --> 3923.8390000000004
those are great documentaries what on

3919.44 --> 3923.839
earth are they spraying and why

3924.64 --> 3931.44
there's a second one too because

3927.68 --> 3934.72
like i was a lot into that i was really

3931.44 --> 3936.0
afraid of chemtrails it's like part of

3934.72 --> 3939.4399999999996
the reason why i got my

3936.0 --> 3939.44
air filter back in the day

3940.079 --> 3943.6800000000003
like i was seriously afraid of that [ __ ]

3942.0 --> 3945.599
i thought it was constantly happening

3943.68 --> 3948.72
like that i don't

3945.599 --> 3952.48
know for sure anymore if that

3948.72 --> 3952.48
is actually happening like that

3952.96 --> 3956.319
maybe it did maybe it doesn't anymore

3955.839 --> 3965.839
maybe

3956.319 --> 3965.839
it's regional maybe it's region specific

3968.24 --> 3973.2799999999997
but yeah i i even knew face to face some

3971.52 --> 3976.16
of the people that were in that

3973.28 --> 3976.1600000000003
documentary

3977.2 --> 3985.68
because i was part of like this sort of

3982.079 --> 3989.2000000000003
uh grassroots think tank

3985.68 --> 3992.48
like this early woke think tank about

3989.2 --> 3994.0
that sort of thing i would join that

3992.48 --> 3997.119
talk about things i would talk about

3994.0 --> 4000.24
alex jones a lot even back then because

3997.119 --> 4000.2400000000002
it had good info

4003.76 --> 4007.2000000000003
so i met couple of these people that

4005.68 --> 4010.24
were actually appeared

4007.2 --> 4013.2799999999997
in that movie it was

4010.24 --> 4013.2799999999997
it was fascinating

4014.4 --> 4018.559
also remember that at one point i did

4016.72 --> 4020.799
kind of bring up flat earth and they

4018.559 --> 4035.8390000000004
really did not appreciate that

4020.799 --> 4035.839
at all this is

4062.33 --> 4065.4
[Music]

4083.92 --> 4090.0
or mockumentary to cover up the

4086.76 --> 4105.839
revolutionary trends

4090.0 --> 4105.839
1 000 turbofan engines what

4112.239 --> 4119.839
how does that cover it up george sanford

4134.63 --> 4137.77
[Music]

4146.319 --> 4161.839000000001
all right see you later

4170.4 --> 4175.679
right it seems a little weird george

4174.08 --> 4178.239
sanford like

4175.679 --> 4180.159
why would chemtrails be covering up for

4178.239 --> 4189.839
that engine maybe the engine is

4180.159 --> 4189.839
part of that ever thought of that

4189.92 --> 4203.84
maybe the engines allow that

4194.88 --> 4203.84
very easily

4217.679 --> 4221.4400000000005
burn hydrogen makes water

4227.92 --> 4233.6
what are you george sanford are you

4229.52 --> 4233.6
saying that those planes

4233.679 --> 4238.64
use hydrogen engines are is that what

4236.159 --> 4238.639999999999
you're saying

4241.679 --> 4246.96
because i thought that they were using

4243.52 --> 4246.96
like this vacuum engine

4247.679 --> 4250.88
that creates an artificial vacuum that

4249.92 --> 4254.4800000000005
just

4250.88 --> 4259.84
makes it not require any sort of fuel

4254.48 --> 4259.839999999999
once it that point has been achieved

4264.8 --> 4276.08
i have been saying that for years

4272.96 --> 4279.04
so how does that work then do they burn

4276.08 --> 4281.04
hydrogen or don't they burn hydrogen

4279.04 --> 4282.64
are you saying that those planes have

4281.04 --> 4286.159
hydrogen

4282.64 --> 4301.84
storage tanks how does this work this is

4286.159 --> 4301.839999999999
all new to me george sanford

4302.159 --> 4307.219999999999
but hey i am 404 hydrogen engines that's

4305.76 --> 4309.6
pretty cool

4307.22 --> 4312.88
[Music]

4309.6 --> 4315.84
hydrogen out of high altitude what does

4312.88 --> 4315.84
that mean

4329.12 --> 4343.84
hello by the way when that show

4344.0 --> 4351.12
mouth ice isn't it a tesla type vortex

4347.28 --> 4353.28
right that that certain new engine type

4351.12 --> 4357.84
i don't know about the hydrogen part i

4353.28 --> 4357.84
know there's hydrogen engines out there

4364.56 --> 4371.84
they convert air into a burnable source

4368.84 --> 4371.84
what

4384.48 --> 4399.839999999999
i agree with jimmy boy there like do you

4387.6 --> 4399.84
have some sources on that

4406.27 --> 4409.409000000001
[Music]

4412.4 --> 4416.32
engine needs fuel to rotate the turbines

4415.04 --> 4418.56
to suck in the air no

4416.32 --> 4419.759999999999
well what i've gathered is that once

4418.56 --> 4421.6
they started

4419.76 --> 4423.4400000000005
start up the engines at a certain

4421.6 --> 4426.320000000001
capacity

4423.44 --> 4427.49
like an artificial vacuum is created and

4426.32 --> 4430.4
that somehow

4427.49 --> 4432.8
[Music]

4430.4 --> 4433.599999999999
causes like this almost energy lossless

4432.8 --> 4436.159000000001
momentum

4433.6 --> 4438.2390000000005
thing this weird effect that's

4436.159 --> 4439.199
specifically part of the the engine's

4438.239 --> 4442.239
design

4439.199 --> 4444.159
so it doesn't actually need continuous

4442.239 --> 4448.639999999999
fuel to keep on going it needs

4444.159 --> 4448.639999999999
extreme little amounts

4449.44 --> 4452.5599999999995
but it's not like it literally just

4452.0 --> 4454.96
sucks

4452.56 --> 4458.080000000001
up the air and converts that into fuel

4454.96 --> 4458.08
i've never heard of that

4459.84 --> 4463.84
there's no transmutation processes

4462.64 --> 4469.84
involved

4463.84 --> 4469.84
as far as i'm informed about

4508.84 --> 4511.84
hmm

4537.199 --> 4553.839999999999
whoa dude

4557.36 --> 4565.28
holy [ __ ] right so that's

4560.56 --> 4568.2390000000005
literally just a hydrogen engine that

4565.28 --> 4568.8
literally just takes water splits it

4568.239 --> 4572.639999999999
apart

4568.8 --> 4574.2390000000005
on the spot and then uses this split up

4572.64 --> 4577.280000000001
gases

4574.239 --> 4579.839999999999
that's incredible i've been kind of like

4577.28 --> 4581.199
calling for that for that to be designed

4579.84 --> 4585.12
because that would be

4581.199 --> 4587.04
like perfect every car could run on that

4585.12 --> 4589.04
you could literally just run on water

4587.04 --> 4590.239
like super efficiently and without

4589.04 --> 4594.719
danger

4590.239 --> 4597.599999999999
so is that it

4594.719 --> 4600.56
seems from the description of it it's

4597.6 --> 4603.92
super sophisticated

4600.56 --> 4623.84
with like the hydrogen generator

4603.92 --> 4623.84
like within it this is incredible stuff

4628.8 --> 4634.719
now these engines been in use for over

4632.08 --> 4634.719
10 years

4634.84 --> 4638.400000000001
okay

4636.239 --> 4640.639999999999
by airplanes right that's what you're

4638.4 --> 4640.639999999999
saying

4643.92 --> 4653.36
some actual proof would be cool though

4650.0 --> 4657.12
that is really the case that they are

4653.36 --> 4657.12
actually using those engines

4662.84 --> 4665.84
specifically

4686.29 --> 4689.51
[Music]

4690.84 --> 4693.84
hmm

4700.8 --> 4703.84
okay well george sanford right now at

4703.04 --> 4706.32
this moment

4703.84 --> 4707.679
the way you're presenting it it's just a

4706.32 --> 4710.88
giant conspiracy

4707.679 --> 4713.28
theory story to me really it is

4710.88 --> 4714.64
like oh power generation size worldwide

4713.28 --> 4718.4
oh yeah sure here

4714.64 --> 4721.84
yeah so what is the proof again

4718.4 --> 4721.839999999999
i know it would fit

4722.719 --> 4731.92
there's about as much proof for it as my

4726.0 --> 4737.04
giants involved in building the pyramids

4731.92 --> 4737.04
seems circumstantial right now

4738.56 --> 4741.92
like what power generation sites can you

4740.64 --> 4744.56
name some

4741.92 --> 4745.4400000000005
and can you prove that is actually there

4744.56 --> 4748.56
and that it

4745.44 --> 4749.44
uses those engines see like where's the

4748.56 --> 4763.84
proof

4749.44 --> 4763.839999999999
i'd like to get some proof now

4788.84 --> 4791.84
so

4806.159 --> 4810.879999999999
yes i got the patent i've looked through

4808.32 --> 4814.239
that it is pretty impressive

4810.88 --> 4819.84
that's not proof though that

4814.239 --> 4819.839999999999
yeah it's literally being used

4822.239 --> 4826.239
so sure i believe that it is real

4826.56 --> 4832.56
does that mean it is being utilized

4830.84 --> 4835.84
everywhere

4832.56 --> 4839.1990000000005
and in several power generation

4835.84 --> 4847.84
sites as george sanford has just put

4839.199 --> 4847.839999999999
put down in my chat earlier

4857.36 --> 4863.509999999999
this is not going anywhere

4859.99 --> 4863.51
[Music]

4866.88 --> 4870.01
[Music]

4874.32 --> 4877.438999999999
[Music]

4886.84 --> 4889.84
do

4907.04 --> 4911.92
well rufus saint hubbins don't get all

4909.92 --> 4914.639
hard on it it's just that

4911.92 --> 4917.84
yeah it sounds plausible but do you have

4914.639 --> 4917.84
any actual leads

4918.08 --> 4922.639
because just because it might be

4921.36 --> 4931.839999999999
possible doesn't mean

4922.639 --> 4931.84
it is actual right

4942.84 --> 4945.84
what

4970.84 --> 4973.84
uh

4977.199 --> 4987.839999999999
hey daniel field good to see you

5039.92 --> 5046.639
really david blackson you think that

5043.04 --> 5049.5199999999995
airplanes with purely using compressed

5046.639 --> 5049.52
air would work

5050.08 --> 5053.28
that is interesting though

5053.44 --> 5070.799999999999
especially because they're already

5056.4 --> 5085.839999999999
planes are already kind of light

5070.8 --> 5085.84
it might work it's interesting

5087.76 --> 5094.639
look into piezoelectric harvesting

5091.52 --> 5098.639
you mean like electrical charging

5094.639 --> 5101.679
through the antennas and all that

5098.639 --> 5102.639
i still don't completely i i don't fully

5101.679 --> 5106.8
understand how

5102.639 --> 5113.84
how that even works it's pretty bizarre

5106.8 --> 5113.84
and if it works it works

5124.84 --> 5127.84
okay

5173.6 --> 5183.84
oh really rufus and hobbits okay

5176.96 --> 5183.84
if you say so

5223.94 --> 5227.139999999999
[Music]

5236.84 --> 5239.84
huh

5246.32 --> 5252.32
oh moth eyes again

5249.44 --> 5252.96
i think i brought this up a while ago on

5252.32 --> 5256.4
in

5252.96 --> 5258.8
my more inspired shows

5256.4 --> 5261.04
and that is that if there is this free

5258.8 --> 5262.96
electricity around

5261.04 --> 5264.96
like that means there is electricity

5262.96 --> 5268.08
around that that doesn't mean there is

5264.96 --> 5271.199
infinite free energy right

5268.08 --> 5273.5199999999995
that doesn't mean that at all

5271.199 --> 5275.759999999999
understand so any energy that may be

5273.52 --> 5277.84
excessively present out there

5275.76 --> 5280.0
if you start tapping into it it's going

5277.84 --> 5283.12
to detract from something i

5280.0 --> 5286.32
guarantee it so

5283.12 --> 5288.88
there is no infinite free energy

5286.32 --> 5290.32
there might be a lot of it there's no

5288.88 --> 5295.84
infinity

5290.32 --> 5295.84
it can't be possible

5298.56 --> 5309.84
i think that part is science fiction

5361.04 --> 5366.96
you can convert energy just like the sun

5364.719 --> 5366.96
what

5368.8 --> 5375.360000000001
right so by that standard if you would

5372.96 --> 5376.159
tap into all that energy and like

5375.36 --> 5379.36
efficiently

5376.159 --> 5380.799999999999
figure out how to take it all does that

5379.36 --> 5383.28
mean that

5380.8 --> 5385.12
the sun will diminish if you ever

5383.28 --> 5387.44
considered that

5385.12 --> 5389.36
maybe it is tapping into that same

5387.44 --> 5393.759999999999
energy source to provide us

5389.36 --> 5407.839999999999
with the solar energy

5393.76 --> 5407.84
ever thought of that

5419.12 --> 5435.84
free energies against the law one

5437.6 --> 5444.8
that's ridiculous now everybody can

5441.36 --> 5448.32
harness energy in some way

5444.8 --> 5450.8
right sure free energy

5448.32 --> 5452.639
does that mean there's unlimited energy

5450.8 --> 5455.1990000000005
i don't think so

5452.639 --> 5456.0
that notion should be discarded in

5455.199 --> 5459.919999999999
general

5456.0 --> 5463.84
doesn't mean that there isn't like

5459.92 --> 5463.84
quite a sizable amount available

5465.199 --> 5477.839999999999
there's always limits

5532.88 --> 5540.719
what convert used oil into flame

5537.36 --> 5546.159
then into guess what i don't know what

5540.719 --> 5548.4
that means

5546.159 --> 5550.799999999999
well this engine talk is getting kind of

5548.4 --> 5553.839999999999
uh over my head

5550.8 --> 5554.08
i'm not a an engine mechanic or expert

5553.84 --> 5557.04
at

5554.08 --> 5558.8
that sort of thing i think that probably

5557.04 --> 5564.8
a quite a few of you are

5558.8 --> 5564.8
in ways me not so much

5565.04 --> 5569.12
but i am always interested like to

5568.239 --> 5571.199
understand

5569.12 --> 5575.84
like roughly what is happening where it

5571.199 --> 5575.839999999999
can go that sort of thing

5578.65 --> 5583.0199999999995
[Music]

5600.84 --> 5606.0
what

5603.199 --> 5607.04
cars in the 1930s could run on water

5606.0 --> 5609.36
what

5607.04 --> 5609.36
okay

5610.159 --> 5618.5599999999995
well look that big

5613.36 --> 5618.5599999999995
oil the robber barons

5618.719 --> 5625.12
basically did destroy innovation

5622.0 --> 5629.84
hide it all and made er make

5625.12 --> 5633.599999999999
made this society uh

5629.84 --> 5635.76
dependent by design yes

5633.6 --> 5637.0
no doubt whatsoever that that is

5635.76 --> 5640.639
absolutely real

5637.0 --> 5640.639
absolutely confirmed

5640.88 --> 5648.159000000001
like very history is even describing it

5644.32 --> 5648.159
even official histories it

5649.36 --> 5655.36
i don't know what it would be covering

5651.12 --> 5655.36
up for except that it would do that

5656.84 --> 5663.360000000001
so yeah

5661.44 --> 5665.28
a lot of stuff was probably invented

5663.36 --> 5668.5599999999995
very early on and then

5665.28 --> 5672.88
thrown out because

5668.56 --> 5674.96
it was not gonna spread because big

5672.88 --> 5675.92
corporation or the rubber barons back

5674.96 --> 5678.4800000000005
then

5675.92 --> 5679.28
couldn't get a grip on it because it

5678.48 --> 5683.199
wouldn't

5679.28 --> 5686.32
help them long-term financial schemes

5683.199 --> 5690.0
it would not provide enough feeding

5686.32 --> 5692.239
bottom for them to make

5690.0 --> 5695.119
for it to be worth spreading it out

5692.239 --> 5695.119
around in the world

5695.36 --> 5699.599999999999
they would just see it as like a gift to

5698.48 --> 5701.5199999999995
the world

5699.6 --> 5703.52
that would make them lose control so

5701.52 --> 5708.4800000000005
they don't want that

5703.52 --> 5711.1990000000005
that's why they took the gasoline system

5708.48 --> 5713.36
and all that and made that the standard

5711.199 --> 5717.599999999999
because they could profit from that

5713.36 --> 5719.199
for a eternity in their opinion

5717.6 --> 5721.04
because it's not going to run out by the

5719.199 --> 5725.919999999999
way like fuel doesn't

5721.04 --> 5725.92
run out in the sense that

5726.159 --> 5729.759999999999
oil wells refill themselves this is an

5728.719 --> 5732.32
abiotic

5729.76 --> 5734.4800000000005
bacterial process as far as i have

5732.32 --> 5742.32
learned

5734.48 --> 5745.678999999999
and oil wells just refill themselves

5742.32 --> 5748.08
right but there is a lot of stuff

5745.679 --> 5751.04
happening around that and in it in the

5748.08 --> 5752.639
processing there's a lot of processing

5751.04 --> 5755.119
so there's like plenty of stuff that

5752.639 --> 5758.56
needs to be done for it

5755.119 --> 5761.44
and that's what they like they like the

5758.56 --> 5761.4400000000005
complications

5762.0 --> 5771.84
gives them more grip more control

5777.52 --> 5785.84
but yeah it's it's been a long time and

5786.88 --> 5792.400000000001
they've i think a lot of the same groups

5790.4 --> 5795.759999999999
have been actively trying to maneuver

5792.4 --> 5798.159
like the big guys have let go of oil so

5795.76 --> 5801.280000000001
now it's just still oil barrens

5798.159 --> 5802.96
and they should not be erased or removed

5801.28 --> 5804.88
out of existence at all that's

5802.96 --> 5809.199
ridiculous

5804.88 --> 5811.76
but because it's not the problem

5809.199 --> 5814.799999999999
and they're moving to electric now and a

5811.76 --> 5814.8
much wider scale

5814.83 --> 5819.87
[Music]

5820.48 --> 5826.718999999999
and yeah i think they're really own

5824.0 --> 5828.8
if there ever would be a virtual point

5826.719 --> 5829.76
where they would literally just give it

5828.8 --> 5832.0
all to us

5829.76 --> 5833.76
it would be after the vast majority of

5832.0 --> 5837.679
people would be dead

5833.76 --> 5841.119000000001
maybe maybe then they would do it

5837.679 --> 5844.56
if ever right because

5841.119 --> 5847.92
that might just be a false promise

5844.56 --> 5852.080000000001
entirely like why would

5847.92 --> 5855.36
they need to keep promises you see

5852.08 --> 5857.679
when they already have it all

5855.36 --> 5860.08
that's the problem with oligarchical

5857.679 --> 5860.08
power

5862.639 --> 5869.28
why would they need to keep promises

5866.159 --> 5872.799999999999
right that's the problem with power

5869.28 --> 5875.5199999999995
if you have it then yeah

5872.8 --> 5877.679
promises and stories are just sophistry

5875.52 --> 5878.4800000000005
to you because you have the power you

5877.679 --> 5881.76
can just

5878.48 --> 5882.0
decide to do whatever anyway no matter

5881.76 --> 5896.88
what

5882.0 --> 5899.28
everybody thinks

5896.88 --> 5902.32
our lord will deal with these lizards in

5899.28 --> 5911.84
the end okay

5902.32 --> 5911.84
if you say so guns have never owned

5912.48 --> 5917.599999999999
or am i a reptilian lizard human

5915.04 --> 5917.6
believer

5917.84 --> 5926.719
not in a genetic physical sense no

5924.56 --> 5928.639
but there's definitely something weird

5926.719 --> 5931.6
with the reptilian spirit

5928.639 --> 5932.8
in spirit form absolutely there is

5931.6 --> 5936.08
something

5932.8 --> 5939.84
but it's not physical it's purely

5936.08 --> 5939.84
spirit realm based

5964.84 --> 5967.84
foreign

5992.84 --> 5995.84
what

5997.44 --> 6001.5199999999995
any evil that sounds to you like an evil

6000.639 --> 6009.119
piece of [ __ ]

6001.52 --> 6013.040000000001
person as opposed to a lizard

6009.119 --> 6015.28
well that's

6013.04 --> 6017.44
your interpretation of what i said it's

6015.28 --> 6019.679
like it's just a different

6017.44 --> 6021.199
like what makes a lizard a lizard what

6019.679 --> 6024.0
in their behavior what in their

6021.199 --> 6029.119
experience makes them

6024.0 --> 6033.28
so typically lizard right so that

6029.119 --> 6035.679
there may be humans that have basically

6033.28 --> 6037.5199999999995
i guess like in an altered spirit or

6035.679 --> 6040.56
mutated or something

6037.52 --> 6044.56
adapted whatever that is

6040.56 --> 6047.6
that they become lizard-like

6044.56 --> 6049.92
in their in their

6047.6 --> 6051.4400000000005
social habit or the lack thereof or in

6049.92 --> 6054.96
their composure in

6051.44 --> 6054.96
how they conduct themselves

6057.199 --> 6061.44
the system they follow and makes maybe

6060.32 --> 6064.48
that makes their

6061.44 --> 6066.799999999999
spirit like a lizard they just take that

6064.48 --> 6066.799999999999
form

6067.52 --> 6071.679
that way to compose themselves it

6070.0 --> 6079.84
becomes them

6071.679 --> 6079.84
maybe that is what lizard spirit is

6081.92 --> 6086.32
pure survival instinct devoid of empathy

6086.88 --> 6093.84
right well that part is definitely very

6089.119 --> 6093.839999999999
strong with lizards

6110.4 --> 6116.638999999999
right but in a way look

6113.6 --> 6119.679
i have empathy right

6116.639 --> 6121.76
but i also have no empathy

6119.679 --> 6123.76
at the same time it's difficult to

6121.76 --> 6126.159000000001
explain it's like you can't always have

6123.76 --> 6127.679
empathy or the empathy will take control

6126.159 --> 6130.5599999999995
of you

6127.679 --> 6134.4
so i do have like survival instinct i

6130.56 --> 6138.56
have it i just

6134.4 --> 6138.5599999999995
i prefer to be empathic

6144.88 --> 6151.6
but i keep it open that yeah i can

6148.32 --> 6156.159
i can devoid myself of empathy

6151.6 --> 6160.08
if if it would require

6156.159 --> 6162.719
to survive like i'm very sneaky

6160.08 --> 6164.719
like and this it's like being two people

6162.719 --> 6165.52
at the same time home almost sometimes

6164.719 --> 6168.4
to me

6165.52 --> 6169.119000000001
like one hand yeah i am open at the same

6168.4 --> 6172.08
time i'm

6169.119 --> 6174.32
extremely suspicious of people trying to

6172.08 --> 6177.199
sneak their way in

6174.32 --> 6178.96
somehow and sometimes they don't even

6177.199 --> 6180.48
know it themselves

6178.96 --> 6182.56
they don't know that that is what

6180.48 --> 6186.959999999999
they're doing and this

6182.56 --> 6186.96
in that way it's not just

6188.239 --> 6193.5199999999995
normal communication anymore

6191.44 --> 6195.599999999999
there's the normal communication which i

6193.52 --> 6198.159000000001
allowed to happen naturally but at the

6195.6 --> 6205.84
same time there's this whole spectrum

6198.159 --> 6205.839999999999
on top of that of potentials

6206.8 --> 6210.08
and i think that maybe

6210.159 --> 6213.5199999999995
yeah some of the people that would be

6212.88 --> 6216.56
considered

6213.52 --> 6216.96
lizards they just get caught up in that

6216.56 --> 6220.400000000001
part

6216.96 --> 6225.28
so much that that is the only thing they

6220.4 --> 6225.28
they are left being able to see

6225.44 --> 6233.839999999999
and that could be potentially considered

6227.44 --> 6233.839999999999
a bit of a grappler

6235.36 --> 6238.719
because they over focus

6240.88 --> 6245.04
um yeah on the survival instinct on

6244.239 --> 6248.239
building

6245.04 --> 6250.96
their own yeah things for them right

6248.239 --> 6252.718999999999
they over focus on their brain part

6250.96 --> 6261.84
utilizing that

6252.719 --> 6261.84
and then you become a grappler

6293.119 --> 6299.28
hmm we can only be [ __ ] on

6296.8 --> 6300.08
so much before everyone revolts and goes

6299.28 --> 6303.84
crazy

6300.08 --> 6306.48
well the thing is

6303.84 --> 6308.88
does revolting and going crazy even

6306.48 --> 6311.5199999999995
accomplish anything anymore

6308.88 --> 6312.400000000001
or has that all been planned in for

6311.52 --> 6314.96
accounted for

6312.4 --> 6316.159
like that is a thing that can happen

6314.96 --> 6318.4800000000005
that will inevitably

6316.159 --> 6322.0
happen to the planners and they just

6318.48 --> 6322.0
know how to deal with it now

6328.84 --> 6331.84
roughly

6356.84 --> 6362.96
hmm

6359.28 --> 6362.96
hello julie of heaven by the way

6369.28 --> 6374.32
i wish my chat was this failed at the

6371.36 --> 6374.32
beginning of the show

6375.6 --> 6387.84
nah it's okay

6397.56 --> 6400.759
[Music]

6412.84 --> 6415.84
so

6435.52 --> 6440.0
oh i missed you all right sorry about

6438.56 --> 6441.4400000000005
that

6440.0 --> 6443.36
all right yeah guns have never owned

6441.44 --> 6446.4
yeah i totally agree

6443.36 --> 6447.44
these people are human but they're not

6446.4 --> 6450.638999999999
the same

6447.44 --> 6453.199
right because they

6450.639 --> 6454.88
compose themselves differently in in

6453.199 --> 6457.119
ways in an unnatural

6454.88 --> 6458.159000000001
fashion and they do it for power and

6457.119 --> 6460.0
control

6458.159 --> 6462.0
but with doing that they also

6460.0 --> 6465.04
effectively sacrifice

6462.0 --> 6471.84
their humanity literally

6465.04 --> 6471.84
they're very experienced

6475.76 --> 6479.76
and some of them might never haven't

6478.48 --> 6483.599999999999
even haven't

6479.76 --> 6485.280000000001
even ever really realized a choice in

6483.6 --> 6488.4800000000005
this

6485.28 --> 6490.639
it may be done to them

6488.48 --> 6492.48
literally so they just never knew

6490.639 --> 6499.4400000000005
anything else

6492.48 --> 6513.839999999999
you got to realize that too

6499.44 --> 6513.839999999999
