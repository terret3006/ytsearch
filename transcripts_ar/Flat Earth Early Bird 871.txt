160.8 --> 167.64000000000001
uh

163.379 --> 170.22
it's Thursday the 22nd

167.64 --> 173.22
of April

170.22 --> 173.22
2021

176.099 --> 180.67999999999998
ah

178.2 --> 180.67999999999998
all right

183.0 --> 187.28
yeah and yesterday

190.08 --> 194.459
a pretty eventful day overall

193.379 --> 196.5
did

194.459 --> 199.92000000000002
go to bed

196.5 --> 201.72
uh when did I go to bed was it like one

199.92 --> 205.01899999999998
o'clock or something

201.72 --> 208.56
right but I have like I'm a little

205.019 --> 212.4
slower than usual because I kind of

208.56 --> 214.62
like got on some harder liquor that I

212.4 --> 217.14000000000001
usually don't really touch

214.62 --> 219.5
that was like in a weird mood

217.14 --> 219.5
yesterday

220.019 --> 225.12
and yeah like I've been periodically

223.08 --> 228.59900000000002
every now and then

225.12 --> 231.72
like getting like that and it's I take

228.599 --> 234.11999999999998
like very little amounts and then water

231.72 --> 236.159
it down even it's just that it's

234.12 --> 238.37900000000002
something else as beer right because I

236.159 --> 240.29899999999998
do just drink beer but it's I don't

238.379 --> 242.39999999999998
drink that

240.299 --> 246.06
very late

242.4 --> 249.59900000000002
usually drink that in yeah

246.06 --> 252.019
after the after work is done pretty much

249.599 --> 252.01899999999998
here

254.76 --> 258.59999999999997
right

255.959 --> 260.94
but yeah man I like I went a little

258.6 --> 263.22
overboard for my own doing not that it's

260.94 --> 265.32
like anything noteworthy compared to

263.22 --> 269.82000000000005
what some people drink out there the

265.32 --> 272.78
amounts but still I can feel it

269.82 --> 277.62
I could feel that I did that last night

272.78 --> 280.08
and yeah I had fun with it I'm not sick

277.62 --> 284.18
but I can still feel it

280.08 --> 284.18
uh alcohol not good

285.12 --> 287.9
uh

292.199 --> 299.46000000000004
right so anyway yeah yesterday's show

295.5 --> 301.74
was I'm very proud of everything I did

299.46 --> 303.84
there I was very fluent

301.74 --> 305.40000000000003
that's not I don't I doubt it's going to

303.84 --> 308.28
be like that today I think I'm gonna be

305.4 --> 309.71999999999997
stumbling over my tongue a lot today

308.28 --> 311.039
so

309.72 --> 314.52000000000004
right

311.039 --> 318.24
but that's just gonna be today because

314.52 --> 320.84
yeah I'm not gonna drink like I did last

318.24 --> 320.84000000000003
night again

322.139 --> 327.18
and tomorrow

325.02 --> 332.94
I'll be back to normal I'm pretty sure

327.18 --> 332.94
you're grown why not twinkle little what

340.02 --> 342.68
all right

346.919 --> 352.919
well

349.139 --> 355.199
I yeah I don't know it I just try not to

352.919 --> 358.919
make a habit out of it right

355.199 --> 362.16
I'm already drinking beer daily right

358.919 --> 364.31899999999996
that's already far enough for me I

362.16 --> 368.46000000000004
shouldn't be like drinking extra on top

364.319 --> 370.46000000000004
of that but every now and then I get

368.46 --> 373.81899999999996
kind of in a

370.46 --> 373.81899999999996
impulsive mood

376.44 --> 379.68
right

377.759 --> 381.539
uh

379.68 --> 383.88
but yeah yesterday's show Flat Earth

381.539 --> 388.139
early bird was good really proud of that

383.88 --> 390.96
very fluid uh the Flat Earth debate was

388.139 --> 394.979
like really rumpacy everybody was really

390.96 --> 397.25899999999996
rompussy it's like India even in the

394.979 --> 399.44
after show and even after the after show

397.259 --> 403.02000000000004
people just kept

399.44 --> 405.18
interrupting each other halfway halfway

403.02 --> 408.5
through the sentences

405.18 --> 408.5
don't know what that was

411.599 --> 417.139
you're a grown man you could uh yeah

414.419 --> 417.139
Amanda Young

417.36 --> 422.84000000000003
well just because I can do that doesn't

419.819 --> 422.84000000000003
mean that it's good

427.38 --> 432.599
but I know I know I can drink whenever I

430.62 --> 435.24
want

432.599 --> 436.8
man like when I went out for groceries I

435.24 --> 440.22
saw two guys

436.8 --> 443.34000000000003
like I think washing a car with beers

440.22 --> 444.66
like they were drinking beer and that

443.34 --> 447.06
was like

444.66 --> 449.22
around 12 o'clock

447.06 --> 452.94
like weird

449.22 --> 455.78000000000003
12 o'clock in the weekdays just what

452.94 --> 455.78
so yeah

460.139 --> 464.22
drink sometimes why not well yeah as

462.479 --> 466.139
long as it's sometimes

464.22 --> 468.0
you know

466.139 --> 470.94
that's

468.0 --> 473.819
and and you can handle it

470.94 --> 478.039
right because there's people where one

473.819 --> 478.03900000000004
out there the one drink is just too much

478.259 --> 481.58000000000004
then they won't stop

482.16 --> 485.72
so yeah you got to know yourself

498.12 --> 504.18
anyway

500.759 --> 506.58000000000004
yeah later in the day Owen Benjamin it

504.18 --> 509.28000000000003
was pretty early for his doing right it

506.58 --> 511.25899999999996
was like oh almost directly after the

509.28 --> 512.159
after show from flatter debate rounded

511.259 --> 515.279
up

512.159 --> 518.159
oh Benjamin got on and he was like in

515.279 --> 521.519
four man he was like putting down some

518.159 --> 525.6
really awesome [ __ ] he did a whole

521.519 --> 529.5600000000001
Eminem live rap thing and he was like

525.6 --> 533.339
really just like be being a Bard like oh

529.56 --> 536.3389999999999
yeah so easy that's oh it's so easy

533.339 --> 539.1600000000001
and but he would literally improvisingly

536.339 --> 541.2600000000001
roll out rap lyrics

539.16 --> 545.2199999999999
all based on everything that he's

541.26 --> 548.3389999999999
talking about like for like 10 minutes

545.22 --> 552.3000000000001
straight or something that was like what

548.339 --> 554.519
and really awesome it was like whoa

552.3 --> 558.4399999999999
That's The Bard

554.519 --> 558.44
yeah that was kick ass man

562.26 --> 566.66
I drink in the house only right

569.459 --> 572.959
what is it Amanda Young

579.42 --> 583.64
does drinking make you a little sleepy

602.279 --> 607.7
anyway like I was really impressed by

605.1 --> 607.7
that [ __ ] man

608.7 --> 614.6600000000001
like

611.16 --> 614.66
you gotta watch it to know

623.1 --> 627.839
oh and being jamming man yeah yeah it

626.1 --> 630.24
was

627.839 --> 632.94
oh when Benjamin is tired

630.24 --> 635.24
is he tired well he didn't seem tired

632.94 --> 635.24
yesterday

641.82 --> 648.0790000000001
I actually find just watching a show

645.18 --> 648.079
very innovating

651.86 --> 655.519
that's the right word

656.69 --> 662.2790000000001
[Music]

660.24 --> 664.86
no wait

662.279 --> 666.32
that's exactly the opposite of what I

664.86 --> 669.0
meant

666.32 --> 671.0400000000001
energizing not any aggravation is

669.0 --> 675.6
exactly the opposite wow

671.04 --> 677.779
talking about bad news of words no I

675.6 --> 681.26
don't find it innervating I find him

677.779 --> 681.26
exhilarating rather

682.14 --> 686.64
[ __ ]

684.36 --> 688.44
it's a good thing I looked that up

686.64 --> 691.079
because I probably would have been used

688.44 --> 693.36
at exactly 180 degrees of what it

691.079 --> 695.6999999999999
actually meant

693.36 --> 698.72
I got it gotta keep checking my own

695.7 --> 698.72
lingo sometimes

699.06 --> 701.899
ah

706.92 --> 710.0
what the

710.279 --> 715.7
okay hello Jerry Springer

713.1 --> 715.7
whatever

722.519 --> 727.74
um

724.32 --> 732.24

727.74 --> 735.26
this popped up in my recommendation okay

732.24 --> 735.26
good for you

737.1 --> 741.9590000000001
right so anybody see Martin litke

740.04 --> 743.3389999999999
yesterday he had like this spontaneous

741.959 --> 746.76
stream

743.339 --> 748.8000000000001
that almost like lasted three hours

746.76 --> 752.16
but yeah I had a lot of fun hanging

748.8 --> 754.8599999999999
around there I was kind of liquored up

752.16 --> 758.18
when it was but it was just there was

754.86 --> 758.1800000000001
something in the air like

761.94 --> 768.0
like he had a lot of like what they call

765.06 --> 772.459
fairy power in him

768.0 --> 772.459
and yeah that was good stuff

784.2 --> 789.74
what was he discussing uh what was it

787.68 --> 789.7399999999999
again

794.279 --> 798.92
typical

796.32 --> 798.9200000000001
things

803.76 --> 811.019
just the Awakening Flat Earth and the

807.019 --> 813.36
coronu mask situation how people respond

811.019 --> 816.139
to that

813.36 --> 816.139
uh

817.56 --> 821.3599999999999
I don't remember all the details

824.519 --> 830.16
all right yeah he brought up like they

827.279 --> 832.62
had a theme going with the rainbow

830.16 --> 835.199
rainbow path and all that it was like

832.62 --> 838.1
the real yeah

835.199 --> 838.0999999999999
fairy power

838.68 --> 845.42
and that's not like a gay fairy that's

841.38 --> 845.42
like Celtic fairy

850.98 --> 855.139
and yeah I was plenty active in the chat

866.519 --> 871.76

all right

945.78 --> 949.27
[Music]

953.07 --> 956.219
[Music]

965.95 --> 969.07
[Music]

976.92 --> 982.279
what

979.56 --> 982.279
really

991.199 --> 993.92
wow

1006.98 --> 1015.6800000000001
yeah yeah get out of here right

1011.3 --> 1020.18
[ __ ] off with your stupid

1015.68 --> 1023.439
famous people sock account [ __ ]

1020.18 --> 1026.78
and also [ __ ] off with your text message

1023.439 --> 1028.52
stalking nonsense you piece of [ __ ] all

1026.78 --> 1031.12
right

1028.52 --> 1031.12
[ __ ] off

1032.12 --> 1035.1399999999999
get a [ __ ] life

1035.179 --> 1040.939
right I have more of a life than you

1038.12 --> 1044.7199999999998
because you think I don't have a life

1040.939 --> 1047.959
right well you're doing this [ __ ]

1044.72 --> 1050.0
to me so you even have even less of a

1047.959 --> 1052.48
life

1050.0 --> 1052.48
right

1099.62 --> 1103.1
wow

1101.12 --> 1105.86
oh yeah

1103.1 --> 1106.82
let's just get some basic [ __ ] then I

1105.86 --> 1112.1
guess

1106.82 --> 1116.48
why not I'm barely present here anyway

1112.1 --> 1119.1399999999999
tap into low frequency [ __ ]

1116.48 --> 1119.14
uh

1119.36 --> 1122.799
I picked up this story

1122.84 --> 1132.86
apparently like a school in Illinois

1126.74 --> 1135.5
had closed because like a 125 teachers

1132.86 --> 1137.9599999999998
were all vaccinated and they all

1135.5 --> 1141.52
reported in sick afterward

1137.96 --> 1141.52
like dude

1142.94 --> 1147.44
so if they hadn't done that that school

1145.28 --> 1149.48
would probably still be open

1147.44 --> 1152.799
but because they all got the vaccine

1149.48 --> 1152.799
they they literally

1153.679 --> 1157.52
they basically closed it because they

1155.48 --> 1160.0
all got the freaking vaccine isn't that

1157.52 --> 1160.0
just special

1176.9 --> 1184.8200000000002
get me into oh really really no no

1181.88 --> 1187.5200000000002
now I think you're an in cell you're

1184.82 --> 1189.3799999999999
probably a gay incel

1187.52 --> 1192.1399999999999
and nobody

1189.38 --> 1194.3600000000001
wants to put their thing in your stinky

1192.14 --> 1196.039
butt right and I'm not gonna do it

1194.36 --> 1199.52
either

1196.039 --> 1203.539
so I think you're the gay in cell with

1199.52 --> 1204.98
your fake suck identity list faceless

1203.539 --> 1206.6589999999999
nagging

1204.98 --> 1209.48
scumbag

1206.659 --> 1212.0
I think you're the [ __ ] incel right

1209.48 --> 1215.659
I'm not trying

1212.0 --> 1218.78
I'm perfectly fine the way I am

1215.659 --> 1221.72
I'm not desperate for a relationship

1218.78 --> 1223.8799999999999
right if I wanted to get sex I'd

1221.72 --> 1225.38
probably take me about five minutes the

1223.88 --> 1228.2600000000002
problem is is that

1225.38 --> 1232.8200000000002
there is a price to pay and this is like

1228.26 --> 1234.02
well well known well known

1232.82 --> 1236.539
that

1234.02 --> 1239.059
this is even the main message that Owen

1236.539 --> 1240.86
Benjamin has too is that if you have a

1239.059 --> 1243.1399999999999
girlfriend if you're gonna have sex it's

1240.86 --> 1245.8999999999999
gonna take away from your power whatever

1243.14 --> 1247.3400000000001
it is it takes it away

1245.9 --> 1250.3400000000001
right

1247.34 --> 1253.1
my ex-girlfriend was really impressed

1250.34 --> 1256.8999999999999
with the way I conducted myself when we

1253.1 --> 1259.6999999999998
met and then she basically yeah

1256.9 --> 1262.8200000000002
unleashed the succubus

1259.7 --> 1265.94
and then that over time over just two

1262.82 --> 1267.4399999999998
years turned me into a complete

1265.94 --> 1268.8200000000002
drained

1267.44 --> 1272.299
yeah

1268.82 --> 1274.7
barely capable well not barely it just

1272.299 --> 1276.86
didn't have the will left

1274.7 --> 1280.159
because that's what that does right so

1276.86 --> 1283.82
no it's not involuntary

1280.159 --> 1286.88
I just don't need it right I don't need

1283.82 --> 1291.559
it I've seen it I've had every form of

1286.88 --> 1295.7
sex that I ever want to experience I've

1291.559 --> 1298.3999999999999
seen it enough right I've had enough

1295.7 --> 1301.3600000000001
don't need anymore

1298.4 --> 1304.5800000000002
right even literally told my ex this

1301.36 --> 1306.86
told her like

1304.58 --> 1310.52
it you're probably the last girlfriend

1306.86 --> 1315.32
I'm gonna have right not because I can't

1310.52 --> 1318.44
get one yeah my ex was a freaking model

1315.32 --> 1320.72
right one of the most gorgeous women

1318.44 --> 1323.179
I've ever seen with

1320.72 --> 1326.659
like

1323.179 --> 1328.8200000000002
I've shown the picture to some people I

1326.659 --> 1332.3600000000001
wouldn't do that publicly yeah she was

1328.82 --> 1332.36
freaking amazing

1333.62 --> 1341.0
right because yeah women are attracted

1337.88 --> 1343.5200000000002
to me like even as I go out there I know

1341.0 --> 1345.5
they are it's just that I'm not really

1343.52 --> 1347.48
available

1345.5 --> 1349.34
I have a mission

1347.48 --> 1351.919
and

1349.34 --> 1354.4399999999998
I don't want to fail in the same way

1351.919 --> 1357.7990000000002
again by going for it

1354.44 --> 1360.38
and then not really having anything to

1357.799 --> 1361.7
fall back on because with my ex I

1360.38 --> 1364.46
literally just

1361.7 --> 1366.559
took a huge risk

1364.46 --> 1370.039
thinking that I would end up with her

1366.559 --> 1372.1399999999999
forever right and it took a risk with

1370.039 --> 1375.02
that as an Outlook and that literally

1372.14 --> 1378.919
made me pretty much lose everything

1375.02 --> 1382.039
and I'm not going to [ __ ] do that

1378.919 --> 1384.919
ever again do you understand

1382.039 --> 1387.919
ever never going to do that again the

1384.919 --> 1390.38
next time I'm going to have sex is with

1387.919 --> 1394.1200000000001
my wife

1390.38 --> 1398.1200000000001
and that if [ __ ] goes wrong and whatever

1394.12 --> 1400.34
then I don't lose everything we split up

1398.12 --> 1404.6
and I don't lose everything right

1400.34 --> 1406.6999999999998
because I bet it all on some dream

1404.6 --> 1408.26
that's what's gonna happen or it's not

1406.7 --> 1411.32
gonna happen and that I'm literally

1408.26 --> 1415.64
going to stay single until I die I don't

part of being a Christian oh yeah

1783.08 --> 1788.539

1801.679 --> 1804.039
out

1804.2 --> 1810.1000000000001
that's my message

1806.6 --> 1813.74
right anybody else out there

1810.1 --> 1817.24
oh I don't think

1813.74 --> 1817.24
well I don't give a [ __ ]

1818.96 --> 1823.3400000000001
I don't care

1820.82 --> 1826.22
you hear me you piece of [ __ ]

1823.34 --> 1827.84
I don't care I don't care if a

1826.22 --> 1831.52
Christian's not supposed to say that

1827.84 --> 1836.0
yeah if if you are staring at people

1831.52 --> 1839.36
that are absolutely horrible and nothing

1836.0 --> 1841.7
they do benefits anybody including

1839.36 --> 1843.799
themselves they are just demonically

1841.7 --> 1847.64
possessed making other people miserable

1843.799 --> 1850.52
yeah I will tell you to [ __ ] kill

1847.64 --> 1853.22
yourself right

1850.52 --> 1856.12
I might just do it myself for you if you

1853.22 --> 1856.1200000000001
give me the opportunity

1856.64 --> 1862.159
right

1859.039 --> 1865.279
yeah I can't I care not trolls versus

1862.159 --> 1869.419
trolls that's fine dude if people want

1865.279 --> 1870.5
to obsess over my attitude concerning

1869.419 --> 1873.5590000000002
these

1870.5 --> 1876.38
[ __ ] bottom dwellers yeah

1873.559 --> 1880.399
that's fine that's a part of me I say

1876.38 --> 1882.44
this [ __ ] right my only objection is

1880.399 --> 1884.059
that the wrong people

1882.44 --> 1886.22
might hear it

1884.059 --> 1888.799
right

1886.22 --> 1891.08
because people that are actually

1888.799 --> 1893.6589999999999
suffering from depression and all that

1891.08 --> 1895.399
[ __ ] yeah it's terrible and I don't want

1893.659 --> 1898.7
to hurt them

1895.399 --> 1901.5189999999998
right so this message isn't absolutely

1898.7 --> 1904.3400000000001
not towards any of those people that

1901.519 --> 1907.3990000000001
that personally suffer from such things

1904.34 --> 1912.1
I would never want to push them over the

1907.399 --> 1912.1
edge or anything but these people man

1913.279 --> 1918.019
yeah

1915.26 --> 1921.2
yeah if you catch yourself

1918.019 --> 1922.76
trying to make other people Miserable as

1921.2 --> 1925.7
a standard Behavior

1922.76 --> 1928.46
and literally doing nothing else with

1925.7 --> 1932.299
your life nothing that's productive

1928.46 --> 1934.7
you don't even have a face in it right

1932.299 --> 1936.019
you don't even attain an identity in

1934.7 --> 1938.8990000000001
what you do

1936.019 --> 1941.539
yeah get out

1938.899 --> 1943.0
nobody needs you

1941.539 --> 1945.74
get out

1943.0 --> 1947.899
everybody's like if everybody's ends up

1945.74 --> 1951.64
too ashamed to even associate with you

1947.899 --> 1951.6399999999999

1953.779 --> 1959.36

1995.419 --> 1999.8600000000001
wake up

1996.44 --> 2002.88

YouTube and other platforms are

2002.88 --> 2009.279
preventing them from waking up by only

2006.46 --> 2012.159
shoving the worst most overly

2009.279 --> 2013.72
exaggerated Conspiracy Theory videos in

2012.159 --> 2017.6200000000001
their face

2013.72 --> 2020.559
instead of the actual really serious

2017.62 --> 2023.08
like doctorate testimonies which are

2020.559 --> 2025.6789999999999
also out there those are kept away but

2023.08 --> 2028.72
if people make like really

2025.679 --> 2031.8400000000001
annoying attention grabby overly

2028.72 --> 2034.24
exaggerated oh Panic it's

2031.84 --> 2036.8799999999999
good friends old memes and tropes about

2034.24 --> 2039.279
conspiracy theory

2036.88 --> 2041.5590000000002
there goes they get shoved in your face

2039.279 --> 2044.26
with the common folk with the normies

2041.559 --> 2046.84
out there right and every time they see

2044.26 --> 2050.32
it you know what happens it's reinforced

2046.84 --> 2052.5989999999997
it's reinforced that idea it's all just

2050.32 --> 2054.52
conspiracy theory nonsense everything is

2052.599 --> 2056.9190000000003
conspiracy theory nonsense if people

2054.52 --> 2060.099
take it tell you the fact seems not safe

2056.919 --> 2064.179
it's conspiracy theory nonsense to them

2060.099 --> 2067.179
because they were subjected only to the

2064.179 --> 2069.06
most overblown overly exaggerated

2067.179 --> 2071.56
tropish

2069.06 --> 2074.74
conspiracy theory video that talked

about it and not the actual work behind

2074.74 --> 2079.379

2326.859 --> 2332.92
you anyway because you're just in the

2329.8 --> 2335.7400000000002
way like a parasite

2345.33 --> 2348.54
[Music]

2350.92 --> 2356.2000000000003
what the [ __ ] am I watching

2353.26 --> 2359.5600000000004
it's called the flatters early bird show

2356.2 --> 2362.4399999999996
where I respond to a gay stalker that

2359.56 --> 2363.4
literally sends me text messages on my

2362.44 --> 2366.4
phone

2363.4 --> 2369.04
on a daily basis

2366.4 --> 2371.2000000000003
and that is constantly sock spamming in

2369.04 --> 2373.24
my chat and being on complainy pants

2371.2 --> 2376.0
think he can report me

2373.24 --> 2378.8199999999997
for speaking my mind

2376.0 --> 2381.04
why not send out positive because I

2378.82 --> 2383.6800000000003
don't feel like it like happy 10 because

2381.04 --> 2386.2599999999998
I don't [ __ ] feel like it I'm not

2383.68 --> 2388.74
in good form today

2386.26 --> 2388.7400000000002
right

2392.98 --> 2396.4
there's a time and a place for

2394.48 --> 2400.18
everything

2396.4 --> 2402.04
yesterday I was in great form and I did

2400.18 --> 2403.66
a great show

2402.04 --> 2406.48
and today

2403.66 --> 2409.24
I'm kind of troll fishing because he

2406.48 --> 2410.94
came in I don't really have any Focus

2409.24 --> 2415.4799999999996
for anything else

2410.94 --> 2417.52
oh babe I'm bad oh no

2415.48 --> 2419.94
I'm here

2417.52 --> 2419.94
evil

2422.38 --> 2427.44
you're squirting again

2424.96 --> 2427.44
Amanda

2439.839 --> 2445.56
yeah I know I am quick

2442.54 --> 2445.56
it's just squirting

2449.02 --> 2451.5
all right

2458.68 --> 2465.0989999999997
I wonder who it is though like

2461.44 --> 2468.9
this person's too gay to be ranty I

2465.099 --> 2468.9
think it's somebody in the Netherlands

2470.02 --> 2474.22
I also like the text messages they

2472.42 --> 2476.98
reveal a number and it is in the

2474.22 --> 2479.98
Netherlands so it might be Ed

2476.98 --> 2482.859
it might actually be added I wouldn't be

2479.98 --> 2485.92
surprised because I totally borrowed

2482.859 --> 2488.44
into his mind the other day and I think

2485.92 --> 2491.5
that really got to him I really

2488.44 --> 2495.28
basically stirred

2491.5 --> 2496.48
a pot in his head which nobody usually

2495.28 --> 2498.2200000000003
can

2496.48 --> 2500.68
probably got a little freaked out by

2498.22 --> 2504.0
that because he got a really mean act to

2500.68 --> 2504.0
me towards me after that

2506.2 --> 2509.2
no

2527.26 --> 2531.2200000000003
I have it on good authority that your

2529.78 --> 2533.44

2535.3 --> 2539.38

2536.44 --> 2542.28
because it's not going to happen

2539.38 --> 2542.28
you don't understand

2542.92 --> 2550.38
do you understand

2545.44 --> 2550.38
you're not going to have that happen

2551.38 --> 2556.079
right it's not like nobody's tried that

just hide it just throw them out don't

2670.24 --> 2675.52

2678.46 --> 2682.14
throw them in the garbage immediately

2684.04 --> 2686.94

2686.98 --> 2692.64
this is more than one person by the way

2689.38 --> 2692.6400000000003
it's pretty special

2703.96 --> 2709.18
yeah Dave Johnson

2706.24 --> 2710.7999999999997
it is kinda

2709.18 --> 2714.04
yes

2710.8 --> 2715.599
see indo-indo tea I don't know I'm not

2714.04 --> 2720.96
in Amsterdam

2715.599 --> 2720.96
but there are Trails here in Utrecht yes

2722.56 --> 2727.18
after this go out and take a walk no I'm

2724.9 --> 2728.98
fine

2727.18 --> 2732.96
Lottie

2728.98 --> 2732.96
you think it's Lottie good servant

2743.56 --> 2746.099
yeah

2746.319 --> 2751.0
I think for some reason I don't even

2749.02 --> 2752.92
know what reason they're just really

2751.0 --> 2755.2
miserable right now because these are

2752.92 --> 2757.359
baller trolls right there's this one

2755.2 --> 2760.4199999999996
stalker gay guy that literally just

2757.359 --> 2762.5789999999997
texts me harasses me through my phone

2760.42 --> 2764.98
right yeah

2762.579 --> 2767.319
I have a little right to be kind of

2764.98 --> 2770.319
offensive when that [ __ ] happens when

2767.319 --> 2772.06
people like Beyond just the YouTube

2770.319 --> 2774.88
whatever

2772.06 --> 2776.68
are stalking me right yeah I have a

2774.88 --> 2779.98
right to be a little pissed off at that

2776.68 --> 2781.4199999999996
and then express myself

2779.98 --> 2784.119
okay

2781.42 --> 2787.619
nobody can tell me I'm a bad man for

2784.119 --> 2787.619
being a little pissed off at that

2788.2 --> 2794.2799999999997
you can say it I'm just gonna kick you

2790.839 --> 2799.42
out oh wow dude get a [ __ ] life man

2794.28 --> 2803.099
seriously get a [ __ ] life ass wipe

2799.42 --> 2803.099
get a [ __ ] life

2824.26 --> 2827.26
man

2830.5 --> 2832.74
foreign

2845.38 --> 2849.94
because

2846.94 --> 2852.52
I think that how that actually works

2849.94 --> 2854.5
like the whole policy if you're not

2852.52 --> 2856.98
supposed to say that how's the weather

2854.5 --> 2859.599
in Utrecht it's fine it's beautiful

2856.98 --> 2862.66
there are a couple of trails but it's

2859.599 --> 2867.579
still beautiful and nice and warm okay

2862.66 --> 2870.3999999999996
right but when they say like in the

2867.579 --> 2873.52
policy you're not supposed to basically

2870.4 --> 2875.559
make it about this individual like

2873.52 --> 2877.54
telling them to kill themselves and all

2875.559 --> 2880.96
that right because

2877.54 --> 2883.54
that's when you basically use your video

2880.96 --> 2885.7
to stalk somebody else

2883.54 --> 2887.5
right

2885.7 --> 2891.3999999999996
that's different

2887.5 --> 2895.78
from a direct integral response to

2891.4 --> 2899.079
somebody that's stalking you probably in

2895.78 --> 2900.6400000000003
the chat right if they are gonna do it

2899.079 --> 2904.1800000000003
and you tell them to kill themselves

2900.64 --> 2907.24
that's different as when you make a

2904.18 --> 2910.1189999999997
video about a person out there that

2907.24 --> 2914.2
doesn't even know about it and then

2910.119 --> 2917.02
in that video elaborately tell them

2914.2 --> 2920.5589999999997
like in a full-on personal attack to do

2917.02 --> 2923.579
that right because that is sort of her

2920.559 --> 2923.579
that is harassment

2925.18 --> 2931.0789999999997
right that is actual harassment if you

2928.359 --> 2933.819
just make a video about oh this person

2931.079 --> 2935.5
that's a real person and you point at

2933.819 --> 2937.42
them and you docs them and whatever it's

2935.5 --> 2940.66
like oh they should kill them that's

2937.42 --> 2943.92
wrong right but that's different to some

2940.66 --> 2948.339
Anonymous piece of [ __ ] scumbag

2943.92 --> 2950.76
literally stalking me on my phone

2948.339 --> 2954.4
and on YouTube

2950.76 --> 2958.2400000000002
basically throwing out the worst garbage

2954.4 --> 2962.319
imaginable never any real facts only

2958.24 --> 2966.2799999999997
garbage only just garbage barfing right

2962.319 --> 2967.599
yeah I have a right to tell you to kill

2966.28 --> 2970.48
yourself

2967.599 --> 2973.78
because you deserve it and nobody wants

2970.48 --> 2976.26
you or you wouldn't be doing this

2973.78 --> 2976.26
right

2977.559 --> 2985.0
if you are only a burden to everybody

2982.3 --> 2987.099
then yeah

2985.0 --> 2987.76
are you going to climb out of it are you

2987.099 --> 2990.2200000000003
gonna

2987.76 --> 2992.7400000000002
grow out of it do you have an idea of

2990.22 --> 2994.7799999999997
how to stop being that [ __ ] piece of

2992.74 --> 2998.02
[ __ ] that everybody hates

2994.78 --> 3000.48
well if you can good luck with that but

2998.02 --> 3002.7
you're probably there because you don't

3000.48 --> 3005.64
have that plan and you don't want to

3002.7 --> 3008.0989999999997
right or if you don't want to that's the

3005.64 --> 3010.2599999999998
moment where I tell you go [ __ ] kill

3008.099 --> 3013.44
yourself you're a [ __ ] parasite

3010.26 --> 3016.38
everybody hates you right

3013.44 --> 3019.68
that's when I that's when I go for that

3016.38 --> 3020.7200000000003
and I only do it in a direct response to

3019.68 --> 3024.66
somebody

3020.72 --> 3028.5
harassing me in my daily activities

3024.66 --> 3030.48
right that's the difference hey I don't

3028.5 --> 3032.16
think you you can even they're not even

3030.48 --> 3034.38
gonna report

3032.16 --> 3035.46
they're not even gonna respond to such

3034.38 --> 3039.54
things

3035.46 --> 3042.059
because I'm not doing the thing

3039.54 --> 3045.18
that they tell you to report it over

3042.059 --> 3048.3190000000004
right because I'm not making a specific

3045.18 --> 3051.4199999999996
video about a known individual out there

3048.319 --> 3052.98
who's not harassing me and then telling

3051.42 --> 3054.42
them to kill themselves because that

3052.98 --> 3056.52
would be horrific

3054.42 --> 3060.9
that would be a harassment

3056.52 --> 3063.66
right that's not what I'm doing so

3060.9 --> 3066.599
just saying

3063.66 --> 3068.94
something like kill yourself to a really

3066.599 --> 3070.619
file scumbag that's stalking you that's

3068.94 --> 3072.7200000000003
keeping completely Anonymous and all

3070.619 --> 3076.619
that

3072.72 --> 3077.8799999999997
I don't think that's against policy

3076.619 --> 3080.52
it's just

3077.88 --> 3082.8
responding to trolls and hey it's not

3080.52 --> 3085.14
recommended to respond this trolls right

3082.8 --> 3087.2400000000002
there's this whole training thing of how

3085.14 --> 3091.0789999999997
you can just like swipe them on the side

3087.24 --> 3094.5
and not get give any responses to them

3091.079 --> 3096.9
yeah so it's not recommended you do that

3094.5 --> 3097.859
it doesn't mean you're not allowed to do

3096.9 --> 3100.02
that

3097.859 --> 3102.5989999999997
right it just makes things a little

3100.02 --> 3105.78
messy but YouTube's not going to delete

3102.599 --> 3109.98
your channel if you do that that's gas

3105.78 --> 3113.6600000000003
lighting [ __ ] and it doesn't work on

thank you thank you gay stalker

3447.119 --> 3454.26
yes stallion8012 I'm very well aware of

3450.48 --> 3458.299
that that's why I I do want it

3454.26 --> 3458.2990000000004
problem was when I was younger

3459.299 --> 3465.299
uh well my bad

3463.22 --> 3466.319
self-image the way I thought about

3465.299 --> 3470.24
myself

3466.319 --> 3473.88
in combination with still bad

3470.24 --> 3475.859
leftist thinking rubbed off on me and so

3473.88 --> 3478.1400000000003
I didn't want kids when I was younger

3475.859 --> 3480.839
and I'm very sorry that I took that

3478.14 --> 3483.96
attitude right now

3480.839 --> 3487.319
like I am truly sorry that I I was like

3483.96 --> 3490.02
that because my life would have been

3487.319 --> 3493.579
very different if I hadn't

3490.02 --> 3493.579
gone with that attitude

3495.18 --> 3500.5789999999997
so yeah I regret

3497.819 --> 3504.799
not having kids when I was younger

3500.579 --> 3504.799
I absolutely regret it

3508.15 --> 3511.2090000000003
[Music]

3522.599 --> 3527.48
right

3523.74 --> 3527.4799999999996
but yeah in the future

3529.799 --> 3536.78
there will be like as soon as this this

3533.04 --> 3541.5
crazy Hive madness out there is over

3536.78 --> 3544.1400000000003
this cultural satanic pollution

3541.5 --> 3546.54
and the covet Crackdown the medical

3544.14 --> 3547.6189999999997
experiment as soon as this [ __ ] kind of

3546.54 --> 3549.96
ends

3547.619 --> 3552.9
there's going to be a whole range of

3549.96 --> 3555.359
women left

3552.9 --> 3558.2400000000002
that are like going to be more desperate

3555.359 --> 3559.2599999999998
to actually find somebody that's not

3558.24 --> 3561.18
just

3559.26 --> 3565.579
somebody that gave up on life and

3561.18 --> 3565.5789999999997
Humanity that wants to have kids

3567.299 --> 3572.96
right people with the right spirit and

3570.359 --> 3572.96
who knows

3573.119 --> 3580.339
what that's going to be like

3575.28 --> 3580.3390000000004
and hey if not then so be it

3582.54 --> 3586.2799999999997
I know I will try

3590.94 --> 3594.599
when you're getting older your joints

3593.04 --> 3597.18
will remind you when you are chasing

3594.599 --> 3599.42
little ones around well chasing them

3597.18 --> 3599.4199999999996
around

3601.619 --> 3606.96
yeah

3603.78 --> 3609.9
but thankfully my joints are probably

3606.96 --> 3612.359
the last thing to to get in my way

3609.9 --> 3615.14
because my joints are great and I take

3612.359 --> 3615.14
good care of them

3620.96 --> 3625.52
turmeric works really well on me

3629.52 --> 3635.7
right and I've not done like physical

3632.7 --> 3637.98
labor in some kind of career where I

3635.7 --> 3640.74
would like end up typically damaging

3637.98 --> 3643.26
certain parts of my body like my back or

3640.74 --> 3645.6189999999997
your shoulder or something like that

3643.26 --> 3649.6400000000003
right I haven't

3645.619 --> 3649.6400000000003
weared my body out

3649.799 --> 3657.079
so I basically retained much of my use

3654.359 --> 3657.0789999999997
physically

3659.46 --> 3667.339
keep my joints in a little boxes

3662.94 --> 3667.339
that's a different type of joint AGM

3671.16 --> 3676.46
yeah but I appreciate that Dave Johnson

3673.02 --> 3676.46
sharing your personal experience

3691.92 --> 3697.92
that's what you believe back then that's

3694.26 --> 3700.98
in the past I know starting 8012 I know

3697.92 --> 3703.94
it's a bit it's been a real nightmare to

3700.98 --> 3703.94
wake up from that

3705.48 --> 3712.26
right because the real nightmare happens

3708.599 --> 3715.799
when you realize that it's a lie that

3712.26 --> 3718.099
you went with the lies that's the hell

3715.799 --> 3721.98
being Unleashed on you for real right

3718.099 --> 3724.1400000000003
when you believe it it just seems normal

3721.98 --> 3726.359
and you think it's all right

3724.14 --> 3728.64
but then when you realize it's actually

3726.359 --> 3730.819
wrong that's when it really starts to

3728.64 --> 3730.819
hurt

3731.819 --> 3737.88
that's when reality catches up with you

3734.88 --> 3737.88
basically

3757.5 --> 3760.64
a clutch bear

3760.74 --> 3766.5589999999997
seeking star water

3763.5 --> 3768.299
ah well seems like the chat is cleared

3766.559 --> 3771.539
up a little

3768.299 --> 3773.9
seems like trolley scored boy at his

3771.539 --> 3773.9
moment

3774.059 --> 3779.94
although they seem just extremely

3776.48 --> 3782.28
responsive to anything anything negative

3779.94 --> 3784.319
coming out of me they just seem to like

3782.28 --> 3786.619
really go squirt with that and every

3784.319 --> 3786.619
time

3788.46 --> 3796.44
it's really weird it's it's almost like

3791.599 --> 3799.44
jellyfish or just aquatic Behavior

3796.44 --> 3802.38
like they don't do anything literally

3799.44 --> 3805.079
just standing by like in some kind of

3802.38 --> 3808.1400000000003
Trans State and then as soon as I say

3805.079 --> 3810.7200000000003
something that kind of touches upon some

3808.14 --> 3812.9
social justice Warrior outrage element

3810.72 --> 3818.299
and then

3812.9 --> 3818.299
get in the way it's it's really pathetic

3819.539 --> 3825.0200000000004
the Earth is flat yeah it is it's very

3822.24 --> 3825.02
very flat

3828.619 --> 3834.0
oh yeah talking about which I had like

3831.78 --> 3838.46
this whole discussion after the after

3834.0 --> 3841.619
show on the Flat Earth debate offline

3838.46 --> 3844.02
I hated when that happened when

3841.619 --> 3845.88
everybody was discussing the semantics

3844.02 --> 3849.0
of calling it a flat earther and

3845.88 --> 3851.2200000000003
discussing yeah but this it's all you

3849.0 --> 3852.42
can't really if you put a claim to that

3851.22 --> 3855.48
it's flat and then you have

3852.42 --> 3856.859
complications and so what else can we

3855.48 --> 3859.559
call it then

3856.859 --> 3862.38
and literally have everybody in there

3859.559 --> 3865.02
was arguing for this

3862.38 --> 3866.94
and I was like no you call it a flat

3865.02 --> 3870.5389999999998
earther because

3866.94 --> 3871.7400000000002
it triggers because it is

3870.539 --> 3875.1600000000003
like

3871.74 --> 3878.0389999999998
it is just absolutely true like

3875.16 --> 3880.98
absolutely true there is no way around

3878.039 --> 3883.3190000000004
it if either you're a flat earther

3880.98 --> 3885.2400000000002
you're a baller and if you're a flat

3883.319 --> 3888.42
earther that refuses to call themselves

3885.24 --> 3890.7599999999998
a flat earther and I'm gonna call you a

3888.42 --> 3893.16
special boy Arthur

3890.76 --> 3895.44
that's what I'm gonna call you if you

3893.16 --> 3897.66
refuse to call yourself a flat earther

3895.44 --> 3901.68
when you know it's not a globe

3897.66 --> 3904.68
not saying that concave whatever

3901.68 --> 3906.5989999999997
if you're yeah if you don't want to call

3904.68 --> 3908.64
yourself a flat earther for whatever

3906.599 --> 3910.559
reason I'm gonna call you a special boy

3908.64 --> 3913.64
Arthur

3910.559 --> 3913.6400000000003
just so you know

3917.64 --> 3923.4
and the funny thing is just by saying

3920.339 --> 3926.16
that that should click a whole bunch of

3923.4 --> 3929.2200000000003
Clicks in a lot of people's heads of

3926.16 --> 3931.2599999999998
other people out there that do that they

3929.22 --> 3932.819
are special boys

3931.26 --> 3935.539
and that's why they're special boy

3932.819 --> 3935.5389999999998
earthers

3935.76 --> 3941.3390000000004
how do you just say no flat earther yes

3939.18 --> 3946.02
stick my yes conditioning everything

3941.339 --> 3948.5389999999998
gets piled on that's the point

3946.02 --> 3952.2599999999998
you don't want oh you want to evade you

3948.539 --> 3954.9
want to have your cake and eat it well

3952.26 --> 3956.6400000000003
then you're a special boy Arthur

3954.9 --> 3959.039
you think you're special boy you think

3956.64 --> 3961.5
you can have the Flat Earth but not like

3959.039 --> 3963.119
the challenges that come with it

3961.5 --> 3966.74
no

3963.119 --> 3966.7400000000002
Flat Earth it's flat

3967.2 --> 3972.6189999999997
and if you can't handle that then you're

3969.599 --> 3972.619
a special boy earther

3973.2 --> 3976.9399999999996
ah yeah clutch bear gets it

3984.119 --> 3991.579
right flat is a description

3986.64 --> 3991.5789999999997
and it's a geometric orientation

3993.42 --> 4001.7000000000003
right a sphere is a literal shape

3997.14 --> 4004.819
but flat is a geometric aspect

4001.7 --> 4007.4199999999996
and it's a description and yeah it's

4004.819 --> 4007.42
many things

4032.78 --> 4037.51
foreign

4034.46 --> 4037.51
[Music]

4039.53 --> 4043.4390000000003
[Music]

4046.05 --> 4049.079
[Music]

4060.44 --> 4068.02
yeah Tom Parker

4063.559 --> 4068.02
sounds really silly doesn't it

4082.099 --> 4085.9
it's a Fantastical claim

4086.359 --> 4090.2
now that's fine

4088.4 --> 4093.2000000000003
let's find Tom Parker I'm not

4090.2 --> 4093.2
criticizing

4102.319 --> 4108.1
ah

4103.759 --> 4108.1
it's getting a lot chillier here now

4111.38 --> 4115.12
I'm gonna put my sweater back on

4145.64 --> 4151.839
ah right

4148.88 --> 4151.839
so

4157.339 --> 4164.0199999999995
okay Dave Johnson so does that mean

4160.46 --> 4164.02
you're a special boy Arthur then

4170.179 --> 4176.56
how was the universe actually formed

4173.0 --> 4176.56
yeah what universe exactly

4181.759 --> 4188.9
hey thank you good servant for the Super

4184.219 --> 4191.719
Chat donation with the Unicorn nice

4188.9 --> 4194.5
is that in there as an option that's

4191.719 --> 4194.5
interesting

4216.62 --> 4219.219
right

4232.1 --> 4234.820000000001
hmm

4237.14 --> 4240.46
one verse

4241.52 --> 4245.860000000001
it's interesting isn't it

4244.219 --> 4247.82
the universe

4245.86 --> 4250.839999999999
[Music]

4247.82 --> 4250.84
one story

4251.78 --> 4257.719
or you could say like the word of God

4254.36 --> 4259.58
the word of God which he started

4257.719 --> 4261.9800000000005
everything with

4259.58 --> 4265.5199999999995
right creation

4261.98 --> 4267.218999999999
that could be the universe literally

4265.52 --> 4270.26
wouldn't it translate

4267.219 --> 4273.82
Universe word of God

4270.26 --> 4273.820000000001
like he spoke the word

4275.12 --> 4282.5199999999995
so he conjured the universe

4279.38 --> 4282.52
through speech

4284.179 --> 4288.86
hello Al Yanke current topic it's all

4287.12 --> 4291.679
over the place

4288.86 --> 4292.699
had a bit of a troll faster the first

4291.679 --> 4296.4800000000005
hour

4292.699 --> 4299.839999999999
but it's getting better talking about

4296.48 --> 4302.48
Flat Earth in the universe

4299.84 --> 4305.679
word of God

4302.48 --> 4305.678999999999
we're talking about whatever

4317.06 --> 4323.2390000000005
all right so universe

4320.42 --> 4326.08
the word of God what it kind of implies

4323.239 --> 4326.08
is like

4326.9 --> 4334.159
God is literally speaking reality

4331.82 --> 4338.12
and it's funny because that could like

4334.159 --> 4341.9
esoterically lead to yeah God is truth

4338.12 --> 4344.14
like God speaks the truth the truth is

4341.9 --> 4348.28
the reality

4344.14 --> 4348.280000000001
Universe the word of God

4357.739 --> 4362.36
so yeah it kind of plays into the

4359.78 --> 4364.34
concept that

4362.36 --> 4367.639999999999
something that I suspect and that is

4364.34 --> 4371.0
that this third dimensional time bound

4367.64 --> 4372.08
experience in the 3D world within this

4371.0 --> 4376.64
realm

4372.08 --> 4381.32
is literally manifested into reality

4376.64 --> 4384.320000000001
through God who literally speaks it into

4381.32 --> 4388.659
reality so this entire reality May

4384.32 --> 4388.659
Simply Be The Creator's spell

4389.54 --> 4397.48
the spell of the universe

4393.76 --> 4401.06
the word that manifests all things

4397.48 --> 4404.259999999999
within this context Within

4401.06 --> 4404.26
this form

4420.32 --> 4426.92
like in my original conception I thought

4424.1 --> 4430.360000000001
that we are literally in God's

4426.92 --> 4432.26
imagination like the Creator

4430.36 --> 4435.739
envisioned

4432.26 --> 4438.280000000001
the physical reality and is still doing

4435.739 --> 4442.58
so like we are literally

4438.28 --> 4444.0199999999995
his simulation the simulation of the

4442.58 --> 4447.679
creator

4444.02 --> 4451.88
the simulation is real it's simulatory

4447.679 --> 4454.46
it is the only form of this real

4451.88 --> 4457.1
right so it's not even a simulation

4454.46 --> 4458.3
because the idea of simulations as we

4457.1 --> 4459.8
know it is

4458.3 --> 4463.58
it

4459.8 --> 4466.219
it tries to simulate something else well

4463.58 --> 4467.659
guess what physical reality this 3D

4466.219 --> 4469.94
reality

4467.659 --> 4473.719
it's Unique

4469.94 --> 4474.799999999999
so it's not simulating anything it's a

4473.719 --> 4476.12
unique

4474.8 --> 4478.659000000001
thing

4476.12 --> 4481.099999999999
that's why I prefer to call it

4478.659 --> 4483.259999999999
simulatory because it is like a

4481.1 --> 4484.6990000000005
simulation in many ways like a

4483.26 --> 4487.64
simulation

4484.699 --> 4490.28
it's not literally a simulation

4487.64 --> 4492.5
because there is nothing to simulate it

4490.28 --> 4496.719
is the original

4492.5 --> 4496.719
the original physical existence

4503.239 --> 4509.139999999999
hope you guys are still following me

4505.82 --> 4509.139999999999
in this train of thought

4510.38 --> 4514.64
under that before that we are thoughts

4512.54 --> 4516.38
in God's mind right

4514.64 --> 4519.56
and at that

4516.38 --> 4522.56
just like a game master creates a

4519.56 --> 4525.620000000001
simulation that people other people tap

4522.56 --> 4529.64
into and play characters in

4525.62 --> 4532.58
well just as the creator of that of the

4529.64 --> 4535.219
d d Master like myself

4532.58 --> 4537.14
in that world there are literal

4535.219 --> 4540.14
spiritual elements

4537.14 --> 4542.179
of the designers of us of me the one

4540.14 --> 4544.820000000001
that actually made up this that is

4542.179 --> 4547.46
upholding this virtual world in my mind

4544.82 --> 4551.42
in our Collective Minds just as there

4547.46 --> 4554.2390000000005
are elements of my real life character

4551.42 --> 4556.6990000000005
in there and that they're palpable

4554.239 --> 4561.44
just so may

4556.699 --> 4564.98
the Creator have it's him

4561.44 --> 4564.98
let's call him himself

4565.3 --> 4573.7390000000005
within this simulation and at that I've

4569.12 --> 4576.14
assumed early that we are basically

4573.739 --> 4579.0199999999995
fragments

4576.14 --> 4581.4800000000005
of the consciousness of the Creator like

4579.02 --> 4584.8
our spirit our Consciousness is like a

4581.48 --> 4587.78
micro version of the all-knowing one

4584.8 --> 4591.08
that is literally doing this

4587.78 --> 4595.04
to understand everything better for

4591.08 --> 4597.64
learning just like I would play a d and

4595.04 --> 4600.739
d game get to know the guys playing it

4597.64 --> 4604.04
going through that story process playing

4600.739 --> 4607.699
it out and we all learn from it

4604.04 --> 4610.28
personally and from how we are and how

4607.699 --> 4613.5199999999995
social dynamics work there's so much

4610.28 --> 4615.5599999999995
being learned from doing that and I'm

4613.52 --> 4616.6990000000005
kind of like well assuming in that sense

4615.56 --> 4618.860000000001
that

4616.699 --> 4620.299999999999
creation

4618.86 --> 4622.94
is

4620.3 --> 4625.2390000000005
a simulation from the Creator to

4622.94 --> 4625.239
understand

4625.699 --> 4631.28
reality

4628.34 --> 4634.179
in a fractal fashion that there is a

4631.28 --> 4637.219
learning process for the Creator

4634.179 --> 4639.32
transpiring right now

4637.219 --> 4641.4800000000005
with us

4639.32 --> 4644.86
with everybody

4641.48 --> 4644.86
in creation everything

4645.14 --> 4650.679
you think I am the Creator what oh

4647.6 --> 4650.679
junkie don't

4655.699 --> 4658.299999999999
dude

4658.4 --> 4663.5199999999995
one on one debate with Randy about what

4683.0 --> 4689.12
why then I don't like those jokes

4686.48 --> 4693.159
it's not funny

4689.12 --> 4693.159
that's blasphemy actually

4715.1 --> 4717.820000000001
all right

4725.48 --> 4731.36
talking when talking about fossils they

4729.08 --> 4733.0599999999995
are almost 100 how do you know stallion

4731.36 --> 4735.62
8012

4733.06 --> 4740.1990000000005
fossilization process completely

4735.62 --> 4740.199
eliminates any kind of time scale

4740.48 --> 4745.759999999999
right

4742.159 --> 4747.62
carbon can be dated

4745.76 --> 4750.5
because it actually has a breaking down

4747.62 --> 4754.64
process once something is fossilized you

4750.5 --> 4757.04
can't date it anymore at all

4754.64 --> 4760.219
so how can you say oh it's almost 100K

4757.04 --> 4761.659
oh really how how would you know you

4760.219 --> 4763.76
can't know

4761.659 --> 4766.879999999999
because it's fossilized and once that

4763.76 --> 4771.679
happens there is no more way to size up

4766.88 --> 4774.4400000000005
what what time it is from at all at all

4771.679 --> 4777.1
not a single clue

4774.44 --> 4777.099999999999
so

4777.32 --> 4781.88
I guess somebody just made up that 100K

4780.14 --> 4785.320000000001
out of nothing it's just a conjured

4781.88 --> 4785.32
number just like in astronomy

4786.08 --> 4790.94
carbon dating is pseudoscience well

4789.14 --> 4794.0
it depends on what you're going to do

4790.94 --> 4798.259999999999
with it Samson

4794.0 --> 4801.56
it is at least a process right it is a

4798.26 --> 4804.7390000000005
sort of a reliable process it's just

4801.56 --> 4807.02
that on the very very long run

4804.739 --> 4809.839999999999
it is overlooked that there may be other

4807.02 --> 4811.6990000000005
influences altering the way carbon

4809.84 --> 4814.219
breaks down as well

4811.699 --> 4817.159
external influences

4814.219 --> 4820.58
that are that just happen and don't

4817.159 --> 4824.259999999999
leave any other remnants in order for

4820.58 --> 4824.26
you to know that they happen

4824.659 --> 4830.0
that is not realize well yeah Tom Parker

4827.42 --> 4832.82
I get it it's not reliable it is a

4830.0 --> 4836.06
process right it's hey you know a better

4832.82 --> 4839.32
way you know any other way to do it

4836.06 --> 4839.320000000001
like to hear about it

4840.32 --> 4843.739
right not saying it's perfect it's not

4842.6 --> 4848.139
yeah

4843.739 --> 4848.138999999999
but at least it is a process

4850.04 --> 4854.5
five different dates from a sample right

4858.08 --> 4862.78
right there is complications that's

4860.54 --> 4862.78
right

4864.44 --> 4868.839999999999
film is out okay cool

4874.76 --> 4878.8
can't Holden explains it well right

4882.679 --> 4888.52
dude

4885.32 --> 4888.5199999999995
the [ __ ] man

4890.78 --> 4893.44
no

4904.3 --> 4909.62
yeah Dutch sailor

4906.98 --> 4913.638999999999
I still appreciate Kent Hoven

4909.62 --> 4916.34
but he is a globe tart yes he is he

4913.639 --> 4918.7390000000005
actually defended the idea that the

4916.34 --> 4921.02
magnetic iron core

4918.739 --> 4923.299999999999
while that the Malden iron core is

4921.02 --> 4925.46
actually magnetic like

4923.3 --> 4927.92
yeah when you say that you're genuinely

4925.46 --> 4931.4
a globe tart

4927.92 --> 4933.7390000000005
that like he's like last people that

4931.4 --> 4936.44
I've seen that has actually attempted to

4933.739 --> 4938.959999999999
defend the idea of a multi and core like

4936.44 --> 4942.94
the last person that I've seen actually

4938.96 --> 4942.94
even try that even address it

4943.639 --> 4946.6990000000005
but hey other than that he's pretty

4945.56 --> 4948.92
awesome

4946.699 --> 4951.799999999999
right

4948.92 --> 4953.12
Nobody's Perfect

4951.8 --> 4957.02
right

4953.12 --> 4959.36
so yeah he's a bit of a globe tart well

4957.02 --> 4960.38
fine he's other than that he's a good

4959.36 --> 4962.0
person

4960.38 --> 4965.36
I think

4962.0 --> 4968.42
very typical American

4965.36 --> 4969.4
mid Mid-American

4968.42 --> 4973.179
type

4969.4 --> 4973.179
Mid-American Christian type

4978.56 --> 4984.620000000001
right against Evolution he is brilliant

4981.199 --> 4986.599999999999
that he started dude I knew about Kent

4984.62 --> 4991.9
hovind

4986.6 --> 4991.900000000001
like a long time ago since is it

4995.54 --> 5001.659
since

4997.719 --> 5004.12
2005 or something and bumped into him

5001.659 --> 5006.28
when he wasn't talking about the globe

5004.12 --> 5008.5
or Flat Earth at all

5006.28 --> 5012.58
and I got into

5008.5 --> 5015.82
creation creationism as they called it

5012.58 --> 5019.48
way before Flat Earth like I was still

5015.82 --> 5023.08
defending that against my friend circle

5019.48 --> 5025.239
of the time that raw evolutionist so I

5023.08 --> 5027.36
was even already doing it

5025.239 --> 5030.28
and they were already like

5027.36 --> 5033.759999999999
note stupid this Evolution it has to be

5030.28 --> 5036.34
oh but look at this it's

5033.76 --> 5039.1
it's exactly the same as flat first as

5036.34 --> 5041.8
well it's exactly the same the same

5039.1 --> 5045.6990000000005
behaviors to say oh look at the

5041.8 --> 5048.34
preponderance of some vague experiments

5045.699 --> 5049.839999999999
supposedly proven that evolution is

5048.34 --> 5053.08
proven and then you look into the

5049.84 --> 5056.139
details and no it's not like always like

5053.08 --> 5058.54
every freaking remark any baller ever

5056.139 --> 5060.219
makes like oh but these satellites this

5058.54 --> 5061.78
and then I build it myself this proves

5060.219 --> 5063.219
it and then you get into it no it

5061.78 --> 5066.759999999999
doesn't

5063.219 --> 5068.199
it's exactly the same

5066.76 --> 5071.4400000000005
so

5068.199 --> 5073.78
yeah I got into creation

5071.44 --> 5076.719
way before I got into Flat Earth and

5073.78 --> 5079.8
Kent Hoven was like a primary example

5076.719 --> 5079.8
during that time

5101.98 --> 5104.58
okay

5114.06 --> 5120.219
where your race is a particular religion

5117.28 --> 5121.599999999999
denomination

5120.219 --> 5124.5
no

5121.6 --> 5124.5
not really

5128.5 --> 5131.94
we were kind of like

5137.28 --> 5143.679
technically atheist

5139.96 --> 5146.32
but not atheist it's complicated it I

5143.679 --> 5149.8
guess agnostic

5146.32 --> 5151.9
but pretty elaborately like in the

5149.8 --> 5154.179
family we all knew like that there is

5151.9 --> 5155.86
definitely a Creator just by the nature

5154.179 --> 5159.78
of things right

5155.86 --> 5159.78
but we were not religious

5171.219 --> 5174.06
[ __ ] man

5177.58 --> 5182.5
dude whoever is doing these stupid

5180.159 --> 5185.199
soccer counts constantly like

5182.5 --> 5187.36
there's not gonna be a trace of it not a

5185.199 --> 5190.54
trace nobody will ever know you even

5187.36 --> 5193.719
were in the chat doing that

5190.54 --> 5196.36
right you're completely wasting your

5193.719 --> 5197.9800000000005
time completely

5196.36 --> 5201.099999999999
right

5197.98 --> 5204.4
you're spamming me of telling me that

5201.1 --> 5208.179
I'm wasting my time is pure projection

5204.4 --> 5211.179
because I'm not entirely wasting my time

5208.179 --> 5213.28
everything I do is something I learn

5211.179 --> 5215.679
from everything this is one of my

5213.28 --> 5218.759999999999
missions right you're you don't seem to

5215.679 --> 5221.86
be abiding by that same standard you are

5218.76 --> 5224.76
literally wasting your time

5221.86 --> 5224.759999999999
utterly

5229.12 --> 5233.46
I reported his account to YouTube what

5233.5 --> 5239.94
it is you mean the sock trolls don't do

5236.26 --> 5239.9400000000005
that that it's a waste of time

5243.76 --> 5247.8
I think it's Lottie why do you think

5245.139 --> 5247.8
it's Lottie

5252.639 --> 5256.42
the troll

5254.32 --> 5259.799999999999
why do you think it's Lottie

5256.42 --> 5259.8
what gives you that hint

5260.44 --> 5265.178999999999
I mean maybe

5262.78 --> 5267.759999999999
a lot is not the one actually called

5265.179 --> 5269.62
yeah sending me text messages on my

5267.76 --> 5271.900000000001
phone though that's from it within the

5269.62 --> 5273.66
Netherlands

5271.9 --> 5275.159
I think

5273.66 --> 5278.44
[Music]

5275.159 --> 5281.699
conspiracy cats no no conspiracy cats is

5278.44 --> 5281.699
not a sock troll guy

5282.94 --> 5288.159
he's just a ball tart and he has like

5285.76 --> 5289.54
ego issues and he will get really

5288.159 --> 5292.98
defensive

5289.54 --> 5292.98
but he's not like that

5311.5 --> 5318.4
exactly tiny one more

5315.04 --> 5323.58
like he's not really a troll

5318.4 --> 5323.58
he's just an arrogant ball [ __ ] guy

5325.78 --> 5330.88
but they not always arrogant he's just

5328.659 --> 5334.599999999999
can be like that but he can also be kind

5330.88 --> 5337.659000000001
of okay just no okay fine

5334.6 --> 5340.120000000001
but he's not like he doesn't have a

5337.659 --> 5342.219
whole lot of nasty in him

5340.12 --> 5345.46
to really

5342.219 --> 5348.46
like really try to make somebody's life

5345.46 --> 5348.46
yeah

5349.3 --> 5354.52
trying to make their life a hell or

5351.34 --> 5356.92
something he doesn't do that [ __ ]

5354.52 --> 5360.0
good on him all right at least he

5356.92 --> 5360.0
doesn't do that right

5393.46 --> 5399.4
well a lot of atheists are angry against

5396.219 --> 5401.44
Believers because the Believers tell

5399.4 --> 5404.86
them no

5401.44 --> 5406.96
things mean something

5404.86 --> 5409.839999999999
this is how it works

5406.96 --> 5411.76
these are the rules

5409.84 --> 5413.9800000000005
and that's the real thing that pisses

5411.76 --> 5417.219
atheists off because atheists don't want

5413.98 --> 5420.159
to know about the rules that's they want

5417.219 --> 5422.38
to make their own rules that's

5420.159 --> 5425.219
why they really get angry

5422.38 --> 5429.1
because they don't want to be

5425.219 --> 5431.62
reminded about the natural order

5429.1 --> 5434.1990000000005
the order of creation they don't want to

5431.62 --> 5437.099999999999
know that's why they would stay atheist

5434.199 --> 5437.099999999999
because they

5437.199 --> 5443.159
don't want to know

5440.32 --> 5443.159
that it's real

5457.08 --> 5462.94
tiny Womble uh good service not playing

5460.48 --> 5464.218999999999
games like

5462.94 --> 5467.62
okay

5464.219 --> 5471.04
he has an account literally called Bali

5467.62 --> 5475.98
cats right he calls himself Bali cats so

5471.04 --> 5475.98
it's not a play on words it's not

5486.46 --> 5492.6
happy curfew is almost over what are you

5490.12 --> 5492.599999999999
talking about

5492.76 --> 5497.04
what curfew there's a curfew

5498.639 --> 5503.4400000000005
oh right there's supposed to be a curfew

5500.739 --> 5507.178999999999
out here right well I don't think

5503.44 --> 5511.659
anybody gives a [ __ ] because I guess he

5507.179 --> 5513.82
cars drive around come past all [ __ ]

5511.659 --> 5517.54
night long so

5513.82 --> 5522.159
yeah I know what curfew means

5517.54 --> 5524.56
but I don't see people really

5522.159 --> 5527.259999999999
caring about it

5524.56 --> 5529.080000000001
although yesterday somebody did get

5527.26 --> 5534.46
pulled over

5529.08 --> 5536.26
by like a a cup undercover like

5534.46 --> 5539.52
and I think that they were just giving

5536.26 --> 5539.52
him a warning or something

5540.04 --> 5546.78
what was it

5542.139 --> 5546.78
past one o'clock something like that

5551.679 --> 5555.9400000000005
right but it's supposed to end you say

5554.02 --> 5560.34
El Junkie

5555.94 --> 5560.339999999999
I don't even know anymore man I I don't

5561.639 --> 5570.159000000001
I've already I'm settled with that I'm

5566.32 --> 5572.5
just not going to do anything they say

5570.159 --> 5575.259999999999
like I'm not even going to

5572.5 --> 5577.6
recognize it's going on anymore I'm

5575.26 --> 5580.4800000000005
literally just tapping out

5577.6 --> 5582.639
tapping out of that system I don't care

5580.48 --> 5584.739
what they say anymore

5582.639 --> 5586.659000000001
don't care what the government says I

5584.739 --> 5588.58
don't care what corporations say I don't

5586.659 --> 5590.98
care what the news says

5588.58 --> 5594.639
don't care for the recommendations I'm

5590.98 --> 5596.799999999999
just not going to do anything

5594.639 --> 5600.659000000001
with it anymore

5596.8 --> 5600.659000000001
just gonna do whatever I want to do

5606.56 --> 5609.629000000001
[Music]

5611.5 --> 5617.52
bars are gay only gay bars

5614.8 --> 5617.52
clutch bear

5625.179 --> 5628.139
but yeah

5628.84 --> 5634.900000000001
bars can be pretty gay but it's it's the

5631.96 --> 5640.26
people that make it gay not the bars

5634.9 --> 5640.259999999999
all bars are gay okay but why

5664.42 --> 5672.34
you've been tapped out right

5667.9 --> 5677.0199999999995
it's just you ignore you ignore the the

5672.34 --> 5679.360000000001
theater and the suggestions and the the

5677.02 --> 5683.02
urgency and the drama about it's just

5679.36 --> 5687.219
like no it's all fake hundred percent

5683.02 --> 5691.0
fake there is literally no coronavirus

5687.219 --> 5693.46
it's not a virus viruses don't freaking

5691.0 --> 5696.88
exist the way that they say they work

5693.46 --> 5699.159
that doesn't exist it's a condition if

5696.88 --> 5702.76
you have Corona you don't have a disease

5699.159 --> 5704.739
you are not infected you have a

5702.76 --> 5708.219
condition

5704.739 --> 5711.94
body inherent conditions standard

5708.219 --> 5715.32
response mechanism within the body to

5711.94 --> 5717.759999999999
recover that's what it is everything

5715.32 --> 5721.54
they're doing everything they're saying

5717.76 --> 5724.3
is all completely useless it doesn't

5721.54 --> 5728.0199999999995
work it's not even really claimed to

5724.3 --> 5732.3
work it's just rumored to work

5728.02 --> 5735.580000000001
and yeah they tied it in with Mass

5732.3 --> 5738.46
genetic manipulation experimentation and

5735.58 --> 5741.699
basically not even telling people that's

5738.46 --> 5743.619
what it is that's where the real real

5741.699 --> 5748.178999999999
criminality comes in

5743.619 --> 5751.299999999999
like that is supremely Criminal

5748.179 --> 5753.639
to just subject people to genetic

5751.3 --> 5756.6
manipulation and not even tell them

5753.639 --> 5756.6
that's what it is

5756.639 --> 5764.08
or discourage people

5761.08 --> 5766.8
from looking into it and finding out

5764.08 --> 5766.8
what it is

5767.5 --> 5773.679
right but because it doesn't exist

5770.56 --> 5775.719
at all it never exists it's a it's a

5773.679 --> 5778.119
hundred percent psychological warfare

5775.719 --> 5782.38
operation and that's the only thing it

5778.119 --> 5784.54
is combined with just free range genetic

5782.38 --> 5787.179
manipulation experimentation on

5784.54 --> 5792.1
unsuspecting slave public

5787.179 --> 5794.8
right that's why I just say I don't care

5792.1 --> 5797.02
what the government says is supposed to

5794.8 --> 5800.1990000000005
happen right now or what's supposed to I

5797.02 --> 5802.2390000000005
just I'm going to ignore you

5800.199 --> 5805.48
utterly

5802.239 --> 5807.94
ignore you utterly

5805.48 --> 5810.94
like oh you say we're not allowed to

5807.94 --> 5814.379999999999
[ __ ] you we are allowed to do that why

5810.94 --> 5814.379999999999
don't you try and stop me [ __ ]

5814.78 --> 5821.08
you can tell us what we're allowed to do

5817.719 --> 5824.26
when your entire premise of everything

5821.08 --> 5830.04
you've done is based on something that

5824.26 --> 5830.04
literally provably does not exist

5830.44 --> 5836.259999999999
so yeah tap out just say

5833.8 --> 5837.34
I'm not going to listen to your garbage

5836.26 --> 5840.9400000000005
anymore

5837.34 --> 5844.2390000000005
like not even to say do the opposite no

5840.94 --> 5846.638999999999
it's just ignore you yeah blah blah blah

5844.239 --> 5849.759999999999
blah blah nobody's gonna listen to you

5846.639 --> 5853.54
anymore we're going to ignore you

5849.76 --> 5855.76
not to go against you but to just ignore

5853.54 --> 5858.639
everything you're gonna say because it's

5855.76 --> 5861.639
all garbage

5858.639 --> 5863.38
and yeah and by the way at the end of

5861.639 --> 5868.56
the trip you're going to get arrested

5863.38 --> 5868.56
and pay for your war crimes that too

5873.159 --> 5878.379999999999
oh

5875.86 --> 5882.0599999999995
what would you say to a cop that stops

5878.38 --> 5882.06
you from going out after

5882.52 --> 5888.46
how would they stop me like really the

5886.48 --> 5890.08
cops gonna stop me how are they gonna do

5888.46 --> 5892.3
that

5890.08 --> 5894.639
I'm just gonna

5892.3 --> 5896.08
go through a small alley where they

5894.639 --> 5899.219
can't follow me

5896.08 --> 5899.219
because I'm on a bike

5907.36 --> 5912.699
but I guess if they would stop me I

5910.06 --> 5915.52
would tell them you are current taser

5912.699 --> 5919.119
they don't have a reach they have what

5915.52 --> 5922.119000000001
they have you have tasers don't fire

5919.119 --> 5924.159
accurately for like 20 meters right you

5922.119 --> 5926.32
have to get up close right will they

5924.159 --> 5928.179
have to get up close how are they going

5926.32 --> 5930.82
to do that

5928.179 --> 5932.9800000000005
right but if they're not doing that by

5930.82 --> 5936.5199999999995
the way that's completely illegal to do

5932.98 --> 5938.678999999999
that here they're not allowed to do that

5936.52 --> 5940.4800000000005
unless you like have a weapon or

5938.679 --> 5941.92
something you know

5940.48 --> 5944.5
and I don't

5941.92 --> 5946.719
but if they'd stop me I'd tell them uh

5944.5 --> 5949.54
you're committing a crime

5946.719 --> 5951.58
this is illegal these orders are illegal

5949.54 --> 5954.28
it's unconstitutional you're not allowed

5951.58 --> 5957.94
to do that and the entire premise that's

5954.28 --> 5962.92
supposed to justify what you're doing is

5957.94 --> 5965.619
not existing and it will roll out of the

5962.92 --> 5967.84
justice system that this is a giant

5965.619 --> 5972.28
fraudulent situation and you are all

5967.84 --> 5974.139
going to pay for it if you double down

5972.28 --> 5976.78
so that's what I would probably tell

5974.139 --> 5979.54
them I would probably spend quite some

5976.78 --> 5982.619
time informing them about how things

5979.54 --> 5982.619
really are out there

5982.78 --> 5987.0599999999995
right because I do care about cops

5988.06 --> 5992.8
like I want Cops to be good

5991.48 --> 5996.218999999999
but

5992.8 --> 5998.679
to have good cops you gotta support them

5996.219 --> 6000.42
you gotta give them the feeling that the

5998.679 --> 6002.42
people are with them

6000.42 --> 6006.42
and

6002.42 --> 6008.82
hold them to task hold them to moral

6006.42 --> 6011.46
standards and the Constitution and what

6008.82 --> 6014.099999999999
is what really matters right they're not

6011.46 --> 6016.08
just well maybe some of them will be

6014.1 --> 6017.6990000000005
super moral and they will carry through

6016.08 --> 6022.4
no matter what

6017.699 --> 6022.4
but a lot of cops are just people

6022.98 --> 6030.678999999999
and they yeah they need a reminder of

6027.54 --> 6030.679
what they're really doing

6033.78 --> 6038.46
make sure it's all about well I I don't

6036.84 --> 6041.400000000001
have that

6038.46 --> 6044.06
and in the Netherlands that gives issue

6041.4 --> 6044.0599999999995
too right

6045.3 --> 6048.08
I don't know

6049.92 --> 6054.84
I I think that if I wouldn't film them

6052.44 --> 6057.659
and just keep it verbal I think that

6054.84 --> 6060.360000000001
would have more effect than if I would

6057.659 --> 6061.86
film it because then they just take it

6060.36 --> 6063.659
it almost like this then they wouldn't

6061.86 --> 6066.36
listen because they just see oh this is

6063.659 --> 6069.119
just a truther guy trying to get footage

6066.36 --> 6071.759999999999
for a show or whatever right if I just

6069.119 --> 6074.759999999999
directly personally address them no

6071.76 --> 6078.320000000001
camera or anything then I might actually

6074.76 --> 6078.320000000001
get through to them personally

6078.54 --> 6083.28
so

6081.239 --> 6086.879999999999
right so unless there's like this

6083.28 --> 6090.0599999999995
outrageous arrest situation and cops

6086.88 --> 6092.04
going over the line really bad yeah then

6090.06 --> 6094.5
of course get the camera out quick for

6092.04 --> 6096.179
the evidence but when it comes to just

6094.5 --> 6098.52
talking to Cops

6096.179 --> 6101.52
it's kind of invasive invasion of

6098.52 --> 6106.46
privacy to then just also film it

6101.52 --> 6106.46
but that's just my opinion it depends on

6106.679 --> 6110.88
what you want to accomplish you want to

6109.199 --> 6113.96
get through to them or you want to get

6110.88 --> 6113.96
some good footage right

6115.92 --> 6118.1
foreign

6119.0 --> 6124.82
Dave Johnson thanks for being part of

6122.04 --> 6124.82
the show and chat

6125.34 --> 6130.4400000000005
I hope you'll have a better rest of the

6127.56 --> 6134.4800000000005
day well I'm now already feeling a lot

6130.44 --> 6134.48
better than I did like two hours ago

6135.3 --> 6138.719
right I think that

6136.98 --> 6141.138999999999
I think the green tea has done a lot of

6138.719 --> 6141.139
good too

6142.98 --> 6149.178999999999
it's all that drinking I think that it

6145.56 --> 6149.179
mostly just dried me out

6152.42 --> 6158.0
ah

6153.96 --> 6158.0
but I hope I sound a little better too

6172.679 --> 6177.7390000000005
some cops are horrific well not here

6174.78 --> 6177.739
good servant

6178.26 --> 6181.219
not over here

6181.86 --> 6189.0
there are some bad cops in certain

6185.719 --> 6190.5
outfits in Amsterdam there's a big issue

6189.0 --> 6192.84
with them

6190.5 --> 6195.3
but they're not the regular police the

6192.84 --> 6198.659000000001
regular police in the Netherlands is

6195.3 --> 6200.46
they've had all kinds of situations like

6198.659 --> 6202.619
oh that they've been subjected to

6200.46 --> 6204.4800000000005
they're almost not allowed to do

6202.619 --> 6207.299999999999
anything

6204.48 --> 6208.5199999999995
they're not trained as enforcers they're

6207.3 --> 6211.08
really

6208.52 --> 6213.92
trained to

6211.08 --> 6213.92
keep order

6214.5 --> 6217.98
that's that's their primary training to

6216.78 --> 6219.119
keep order

6217.98 --> 6221.28
right

6219.119 --> 6223.44
because as soon as somebody like gets

6221.28 --> 6226.199
out and gets oh

6223.44 --> 6229.44
out of control and personal and dominant

6226.199 --> 6231.36
behavior and such against public they

6229.44 --> 6234.119
get in trouble

6231.36 --> 6235.739
a lot of trouble usually so that doesn't

6234.119 --> 6237.48
happen here it's a very different

6235.739 --> 6239.459999999999
situation

6237.48 --> 6242.0
here in the Netherlands as it is in the

6239.46 --> 6242.0
United States

6242.04 --> 6248.6
because cops there get just insane

6245.04 --> 6248.6
policies and training

6249.36 --> 6253.739
like that that

6250.98 --> 6255.178999999999
the Netherlands has criticized the

6253.739 --> 6257.699
United States

6255.179 --> 6260.28
for doing that for for a long for

6257.699 --> 6262.5599999999995
decades for a long time

6260.28 --> 6264.96
like everybody on the in the Netherlands

6262.56 --> 6266.88
like right wing left wing they would all

6264.96 --> 6268.8
be criticizing like well at least we

6266.88 --> 6270.6
don't have freaking police policies like

6268.8 --> 6271.9800000000005
in the United States because that's just

6270.6 --> 6273.3
nuts

6271.98 --> 6277.099999999999
right

6273.3 --> 6277.1
we all agreed on that here

6287.219 --> 6289.82
all right

6295.08 --> 6299.9
attract a certain type of person right

6297.119 --> 6299.9
well yeah

6301.32 --> 6308.219
but it still depends on the opportunity

6305.639 --> 6309.84
did you ever consider being cop when you

6308.219 --> 6312.84
were younger oh yes

6309.84 --> 6318.139
it's funny that you say because in ways

6312.84 --> 6318.139
I am still considering it it's just that

6318.179 --> 6322.219
the amount of rules

6322.38 --> 6328.26
that's not doable it I can't do it I

6325.32 --> 6332.46
don't want to do that right I'll just be

6328.26 --> 6337.26
a public order figure like a voluntary

6332.46 --> 6340.5
cop not bind by rules a civilian not any

6337.26 --> 6341.9400000000005
Authority like that but I'd rather just

6340.5 --> 6344.639
be me

6341.94 --> 6346.799999999999
and just be known as like somebody that

6344.639 --> 6349.139
very much sympathizes with cops and all

6346.8 --> 6351.42
that but the rules they have to go

6349.139 --> 6354.900000000001
through here it's just I can't do that

6351.42 --> 6358.619
there's no way no way

6354.9 --> 6361.379999999999
way too complicated it's I'm not I'm not

6358.619 --> 6364.08
well built for that for just absorbing

6361.38 --> 6367.56
all those rules and mechanisms because

6364.08 --> 6370.32
it becomes very unnatural like

6367.56 --> 6372.84
and I'm a primary like a naturalist so

6370.32 --> 6375.239
that does not work for me

6372.84 --> 6378.38
does not work like my talents would be

6375.239 --> 6378.379999999999
completely shut in

6381.719 --> 6387.119
but I'm definitely a police sympathizer

6401.46 --> 6404.9
right yeah that's Taylor

6405.659 --> 6410.699
well the police it's a complicated

6407.94 --> 6412.5
situation because the real police in the

6410.699 --> 6414.719
United States

6412.5 --> 6416.58
is really the sheriff

6414.719 --> 6419.4800000000005
who is elected

6416.58 --> 6422.34
and then the sheriff appoints officers

6419.48 --> 6425.5199999999995
and all that

6422.34 --> 6429.0
and well beyond most police are

6425.52 --> 6429.0
basically Mercenaries

6429.119 --> 6433.619
and yeah it's whatever policy they're

6431.699 --> 6435.9
going to have that's going to determine

6433.619 --> 6438.799999999999
how they function right and that's

6435.9 --> 6438.799999999999
partially the problem

6454.56 --> 6460.4400000000005
I love also videos people who are audit

6457.86 --> 6462.739
Taurus filming and getting corrupted

6460.44 --> 6462.739
please

6465.659 --> 6470.94
yeah corrupted police is really sucky

6468.139 --> 6472.92
it's terrible when that's the case

6470.94 --> 6475.44
anywhere

6472.92 --> 6478.5
because corrupted police will let all

6475.44 --> 6482.0
kinds of dark [ __ ] slip through that's

6478.5 --> 6482.0
that's the primary problem

6482.76 --> 6489.900000000001
that's the real corruption

6486.0 --> 6492.9
is that they allow the darker [ __ ] to

6489.9 --> 6494.638999999999
pass through they don't stop that

6492.9 --> 6499.08
they're like

6494.639 --> 6501.2390000000005
yeah they're gimps towards the true evil

6499.08 --> 6504.0199999999995
that's the real corruption that's the

6501.239 --> 6504.0199999999995
real problems

6506.04 --> 6510.86
all right anyway I think I'm rounding

6508.38 --> 6510.86
out the show

6526.5 --> 6529.1
what

6544.26 --> 6550.04
many have been fired by this auditing

6546.96 --> 6550.04
people what

6554.82 --> 6559.44
right

6556.26 --> 6561.360000000001
well in the Netherlands we do definitely

6559.44 --> 6562.86
need to kind of sweep through the

6561.36 --> 6565.5199999999995
situation

6562.86 --> 6568.619
right there's well-known

6565.52 --> 6571.280000000001
long-term problems like mija Cuts have

6568.619 --> 6571.28
you ever heard of him

6571.5 --> 6576.9
like he's been trying to do something

6573.84 --> 6580.04
about like the justice system over here

6576.9 --> 6582.598999999999
some specific individuals involved with

6580.04 --> 6585.48
alleged pedophilia

6582.599 --> 6588.06
like and that's been going on for a long

6585.48 --> 6589.619
time so yeah there's definitely a lot of

6588.06 --> 6592.320000000001
cleanup that needs to be done here in

6589.619 --> 6594.42
the Netherlands I agree that Center

6592.32 --> 6596.88
anyway yeah rounding out the show so

6594.42 --> 6598.38
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6596.88 --> 6601.92
like this show

6598.38 --> 6604.8
despite the start being a little rough

6601.92 --> 6606.84
got a lot of trolls at the start and I

6604.8 --> 6609.78
got yeah pretty

6606.84 --> 6611.88
pretty hard hard on them

6609.78 --> 6613.159
but they deserve it and we're not taking

6611.88 --> 6616.619
it back

6613.159 --> 6620.219
and I don't think this video is going to

6616.619 --> 6623.46
be taken down yeah

6620.219 --> 6626.04
it's not being taken down no it's not so

6623.46 --> 6628.9800000000005

6626.04 --> 6632.3
any kind of grip on what I do you can't

6628.98 --> 6632.299999999999
stop me right

6632.58 --> 6636.139
either you step away

6636.239 --> 6640.0199999999995
or or keep trolling but you can't stop

6639.06 --> 6643.860000000001
me

6640.02 --> 6645.0
because I can do whatever the [ __ ] I

6643.86 --> 6647.639
want

6645.0 --> 6649.82
I know what I'm doing I'll just keep it
