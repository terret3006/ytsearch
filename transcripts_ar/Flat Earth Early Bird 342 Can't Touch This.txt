6.19 --> 29.109
[Music]

31.66 --> 33.72
you

41.829 --> 49.160000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.89 --> 50.809
early-bird number 342 I'm your host

49.16 --> 52.489
Arwen and before I start the show please

50.809 --> 55.01
don't forget to share it on any platform

52.489 --> 56.959999999999994
you deem fit you know so if you haven't

55.01 --> 58.58
already subscribed to my channel and hit

56.96 --> 60.230000000000004
the bell notification so you know when

58.58 --> 62.54
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

60.23 --> 65.17999999999999
p.m. amsterdam time every day also

62.54 --> 67.58
please do support me and my channel

65.18 --> 69.77000000000001
through the paypal patreon ami go fund

67.58 --> 74.63
me and the super chats that will be much

69.77 --> 76.55
appreciated so today is the weather is

74.63 --> 80.05
something else yeah I mean my t-shirt

76.55 --> 84.289
because it is astounding it is like a

80.05 --> 90.08
spring break except it's not spring it's

84.289 --> 92.289
autumn and it's warm like it's not

90.08 --> 100.009
summer level warm but it is really

92.289 --> 102.47
really nice a bit windy but not a cold

100.009 --> 104.72
wind seems to be a lot of chemtrail

102.47 --> 109.099
activity still going on but not a lot of

104.72 --> 113.95
natural cloud formations in contrast to

109.099 --> 119.33
yesterday and yeah bright bright bright

113.95 --> 119.75
Sun so just a really nice smoke over

119.33 --> 122.89
there

119.75 --> 122.89
in the Sun

123.56 --> 130.019
yeah it's strange day

126.78 --> 134.989
very beautiful besides the chemtrails

130.019 --> 137.64000000000001
that is so yeah let's see who is in chat

134.989 --> 146.459
before we do that I got Tamara coffee

137.64 --> 151.13
with me te and and Illuminati car song

146.459 --> 151.13
so for a change

153.23 --> 156.75
yeah today for me what's in a hurry

156.0 --> 160.29
hurry hurry

156.75 --> 162.63
cuz I got up very late because I went to

160.29 --> 167.31
bed very late anyway so let's see who is

162.63 --> 171.06
in chat AGM was first doc Michael silver

167.31 --> 177.39000000000001
umbrella Steve Amanda young CooCoo

171.06 --> 183.29
Irenaeus toll loss tau Asteria stone

177.39 --> 183.29
monkey 3d code tips for all

186.11 --> 194.45000000000002
Steve William be call drunken ballot for

190.31 --> 195.2
one one you go playing an anchor had a

194.45 --> 200.29999999999998
meeting

195.2 --> 203.53
Nathan Oakley 1980 Amanda young

200.3 --> 209.39000000000001
yeah good to see you all Oh Julia Pavan

203.53 --> 217.4
skipped you there da studio 60 egg all

209.39 --> 219.73
right so let's get my bearings for a

217.4 --> 219.73000000000002
moment

227.39 --> 234.61999999999998
man oh yeah yep

231.01 --> 240.85999999999999
yeah the most notable thing from

234.62 --> 244.9
yesterday came in really late chocolate

240.86 --> 250.75
found it somewhere it says clip of this

244.9 --> 254.24
astrophysicist basically just pulling a

250.75 --> 258.32
as I call it a rumpus level coming clean

254.24 --> 260.69
error it basically just comes out clean

258.32 --> 263.59999999999997
and tells the shameful truth and then

260.69 --> 265.16
tries to well he tried to cover it up

263.6 --> 267.23
probably but it didn't work properly so

265.16 --> 271.07000000000005
it just spelled his guts basically I

267.23 --> 276.47
would really want to present it so I'm

271.07 --> 278.89
gonna try to do that let's see yeah the

276.47 --> 278.89000000000004
scat

285.09 --> 294.65999999999997
oh yeah you got to hear it with sound

288.23 --> 299.66900000000004
it's it's special alright so here we go

294.66 --> 302.43
I this is from Russian Fitz if I get it

299.669 --> 305.01
got it right we always say that you make

302.43 --> 307.02
observations you have a theory you could

305.01 --> 312.59999999999997
make more observations and it's a very

307.02 --> 317.69
very tedious process wrong no wait that

312.6 --> 324.99
didn't came through very loud huh

317.69 --> 326.16
how can I improve that and let's let's

324.99 --> 329.91
just keep on going

326.16 --> 332.85
Oh buddy that I know of in my field on

329.91 --> 334.83000000000004
user the so-called scientific method in

332.85 --> 337.65000000000003
our field is by the seat of your pants

334.83 --> 341.35999999999996
it's leaps of logic is guesswork it's

337.65 --> 341.35999999999996
guesswork is guesswork

341.489 --> 346.74899999999997
all right so let's see it again we

345.039 --> 349.179
always say that you make observations

346.749 --> 350.86
you have a theory you make four

349.179 --> 354.849
observations and it's a very very

350.86 --> 357.699
tedious process wrong nobody that I know

354.849 --> 360.12899999999996
of in my field uses the so-called

357.699 --> 361.17900000000003
scientific method in our field is by the

360.129 --> 364.029
seat of your pants

361.179 --> 370.679
it's leaps of logic it's guesswork it's

364.029 --> 380.289
guesswork is guesswork isn't that just

370.679 --> 381.669
special I hope you heard that yeah and

380.289 --> 383.55899999999997
not just guesswork

381.669 --> 386.829
it's leaps of logic yeah that's right

383.559 --> 400.269
it's presuppositional thinking so he hit

386.829 --> 402.129
it right on the head yeah all thanks

400.269 --> 405.749
goes to chocolate for finding it and

402.129 --> 409.959
apparently yeah for a Russian fits for

405.749 --> 412.97900000000004
for catching the original clip yeah

409.959 --> 412.979
that's special

420.11 --> 431.12
oh god no no bill Thompson no Feynman

427.069 --> 435.969
wrote about the atmosphere oh my god the

431.12 --> 435.969
dread this is terrible

436.599 --> 441.37899999999996
are you implying that because he used

439.729 --> 443.75
the word atmosphere that he's

441.379 --> 448.81
automatically implying his fear because

443.75 --> 448.81
of it and that's proof for your sphere

449.11 --> 452.68
bill Thompson

468.23 --> 475.36
yeah Nathan Oakley I think he is

472.19 --> 480.07
probably pointing at bill or at Feynman

475.36 --> 484.69
diamond modeling certain aspects out or

480.07 --> 484.69
indulging in presuppositional thinking

491.53 --> 497.67999999999995
yeah the right to pressure gradient

501.3 --> 503.81
it

505.639 --> 515.62
whoo Wow

510.969 --> 519.74
no he just derived the pressure gradient

515.62 --> 526.149
by the fact of how gas particles slowed

519.74 --> 526.149
down when traveling upwards really Oh

529.329 --> 538.579
what was his experimental setup for this

532.37 --> 541.51
is gas particles slow down when

538.579 --> 541.51
traveling upwards

549.34 --> 555.37
right well in in a way that does kind of

552.22 --> 562.96
make sense although I wouldn't put it as

555.37 --> 565.75
a as an yeah what do you say I let's

562.96 --> 569.71
just say that there may be something to

565.75 --> 572.44
that but I think I can very easily

569.71 --> 574.6
explain that how that works with

572.44 --> 579.5500000000001
relative density theory which is

574.6 --> 584.5
grounded in scientific proof so it makes

579.55 --> 587.89
sense that gas if it was of a lower

584.5 --> 590.65
density as it was traveling up in well

587.89 --> 593.71
and in the dy preponderance of gas

590.65 --> 597.3389999999999
within our container as it would go

593.71 --> 602.62
upward the gas is over there roughly

597.339 --> 605.5290000000001
would get lower in density thus making

602.62 --> 608.71
the density differential between the two

605.529 --> 612.25
less and less as it go up and the less

608.71 --> 617.35
the differential is the slower the rise

612.25 --> 619.3
just as things as I think this is

617.35 --> 622.99
probably even testable with for example

619.3 --> 627.6999999999999
water if you had a big ocean if you

622.99 --> 631.42
dropped a big boulder or a big brick in

627.7 --> 635.32
it I think that probably at the top it

631.42 --> 637.6899999999999
would fall faster then as it starts to

635.32 --> 639.73
approach the bottom if it is booked if

637.69 --> 643.48
it is big enough it is all about the

639.73 --> 644.89
size of of it all because with the

643.48 --> 647.37
shallow layer there's nothing really

644.89 --> 647.37
going to happen

650.17 --> 654.91
see makes sense like if you drop a brick

652.87 --> 657.07
that it would fall faster at the top and

654.91 --> 661.03
slower at the bottom because there's

657.07 --> 664.9300000000001
just the water down there is under more

661.03 --> 671.4399999999999
effective pressure from it all

664.93 --> 674.65
causing an effective shift I guess

671.44 --> 676.45
within the relative density between the

674.65 --> 678.76
water and the brick although the brick

676.45 --> 683.1400000000001
itself would also be subjected to that

678.76 --> 686.02
pressure I don't know exactly but the

683.14 --> 691.42
concept makes sense if you take into

686.02 --> 693.34
account what would happen with objects

691.42 --> 695.4699999999999
or gases or fluids or anything that

693.34 --> 698.11
would be moving towards their

695.47 --> 701.83
equilibrium within the spectrum of all

698.11 --> 704.0500000000001
things it would typically slow down if

701.83 --> 708.25
it had a fast distance to cross and

704.05 --> 712.0
there would be a gradient within the

708.25 --> 715.96
gases or the fluids present which that

712.0 --> 718.93
tends to be like things naturally settle

715.96 --> 722.37
like that so it makes perfect sense I

718.93 --> 724.1999999999999
don't see this as any kind of proof that

722.37 --> 727.72
disproves the second law of

724.2 --> 730.96
thermodynamics that just because gases

727.72 --> 733.21
would slow down as they would rise that

730.96 --> 736.87
that somehow proves that they will stop

733.21 --> 738.4300000000001
at some point without the necessity of a

736.87 --> 740.67
container I think that is what Bill

738.43 --> 745.77
Thompson was trying to imply here

740.67 --> 749.55
they're falsely very obviously falsely

745.77 --> 749.55
because that's not the case

751.9 --> 755.05
all right

756.67 --> 759.3
yeah

763.6 --> 768.44
alright reckoner Stefan huh listen well

765.95 --> 772.7
apparently Bill Thompson is now starting

768.44 --> 775.7600000000001
to say that Fineman said or did

772.7 --> 778.84
something that supposedly proves that

775.76 --> 784.42
the atmosphere is next to a vacuum

778.84 --> 784.4200000000001
that's what I think he's trying to claim

784.63 --> 794.57
by inserting a mechanic within there

788.99 --> 797.9
yeah within our atmosphere but he didn't

794.57 --> 799.82
really elaborate on that so I quickly

797.9 --> 801.62
reverse engineered it built on the

799.82 --> 806.1500000000001
relative density theory explaining

801.62 --> 809.69
exactly why the supposed phenomena would

806.15 --> 816.86
happen grounded in theoretic in

809.69 --> 820.49
scientific facts oh yeah well Bill

816.86 --> 821.0
Thompson that's really cool I agree you

820.49 --> 826.1
get it

821.0 --> 828.29
Bill Thompson I agree that gas particles

826.1 --> 833.47
slow down when traveling upwards because

828.29 --> 836.3299999999999
of what the container is and must be and

833.47 --> 839.6
there is a gradient and if there is a

836.33 --> 841.6700000000001
gradient and for therefore there to be a

839.6 --> 843.59
gradient in the first place there's to

841.67 --> 846.53
be gas pressure and for gas pressure has

843.59 --> 849.35
to be container but yeah if there is a

846.53 --> 851.99
gradient and there is measurably then it

849.35 --> 855.9200000000001
makes sense that gases as days travel

851.99 --> 858.25
upwards will slow down and I can

855.92 --> 864.89
actually explain that in scientific

858.25 --> 866.57
grounded theory contrasts to you so I

864.89 --> 870.11
don't only agree on it I can actually

866.57 --> 872.47
give a foundation as to why Bill

870.11 --> 872.47
Thompson

892.29 --> 895.39
[Music]

899.17 --> 902.1999999999999
[Music]

909.95 --> 917.6600000000001
all right well Philip Cooper what makes

913.639 --> 920.779
it work I don't know it makes it work

917.66 --> 921.56
the circumstances make it work why I

920.779 --> 924.01
don't know

921.56 --> 927.709
but I do know that they do and

924.01 --> 931.04
experimentally proven anyone can do it

927.709 --> 933.3499999999999
it's extremely easy it doesn't matter

931.04 --> 935.769
how complex you make the circumstances

933.35 --> 941.72
the system works

935.769 --> 943.13
always always I've been being more and

941.72 --> 945.1990000000001
more precise with my elaborate

943.13 --> 947.63
descriptions of how it works how the

945.199 --> 948.949
relative density Theory works the

947.63 --> 952.01
displacement caused by the

948.949 --> 956.5699999999999
disequilibrium how it creates a force

952.01 --> 959.0
that causes acceleration and of course

956.57 --> 961.7600000000001
with motion there's always friction

959.0 --> 966.32
involved of the medium it is traveling

961.76 --> 969.61
through that has an involvement and yeah

966.32 --> 973.25
once the maneuverability of an object or

969.61 --> 977.3000000000001
contain liquor or anything stops then

973.25 --> 980.75
the whole body instead starts to exert

977.3 --> 983.5889999999999
pressure towards its equilibrium point

980.75 --> 991.18
with lack of being able to move there

983.589 --> 995.089
that's how it works how it all works and

991.18 --> 997.04
hey gases moving upwards and slowing

995.089 --> 1000.899
down as they're traveling upwards yeah

997.04 --> 1003.519
makes sense I can explain that I can

1000.899 --> 1010.149
describe how that works through the

1003.519 --> 1015.91
relative density theory as I have but

1010.149 --> 1019.39
the direction Y I am NOT concerned with

1015.91 --> 1022.06
such things that's that's a child's

1019.39 --> 1024.6299999999999
question and it's yeah sure it's a

1022.06 --> 1028.24
legitimate question but I am not really

1024.63 --> 1032.709
concerning myself with that I'd rather

1028.24 --> 1037.47
just be correct about things that I know

1032.709 --> 1040.199
and that is

1037.47 --> 1044.759
yeah it's established up and down that's

1040.199 --> 1049.3990000000001
how the relative density spectrum aligns

1044.759 --> 1052.259
itself here in this world and that's it

1049.399 --> 1054.2689999999998
that's all I know I don't exactly know

1052.259 --> 1058.5
why there's been a lot of theorizing as

1054.269 --> 1064.019
to why how polarization electrostatics

1058.5 --> 1069.83
kind of go there but that's really tough

1064.019 --> 1076.019
to to find proof that really cuts wood

1069.83 --> 1078.379
it's tough oh by the way a thank you

1076.019 --> 1082.889
Amanda young for the $10 shop catenation

1078.379 --> 1086.4189999999999
hey Arwen I can stay long I have two

1082.889 --> 1089.0089999999998
hours work have a good day all right

1086.419 --> 1094.3990000000001
thank you for the super chat Amanda

1089.009 --> 1094.3990000000001
young price appreciate you

1112.56 --> 1118.56
all right Gentiles other channel

1115.43 --> 1123.8100000000002
interesting question yeah water is

1118.56 --> 1127.56
incompressible but what it effectively

1123.81 --> 1131.25
does because that is like a crystal it

1127.56 --> 1134.1799999999998
just pushes the whole body apart in all

1131.25 --> 1137.76
directions and the whole pressure shifts

1134.18 --> 1140.5800000000002
you can feel that have you ever

1137.76 --> 1142.92
experienced that you're sitting in a

1140.58 --> 1147.96
relatively big body of water say a

1142.92 --> 1154.71
swimming pool and then like for example

1147.96 --> 1156.54
a very big guy jumps in like hmm yeah of

1154.71 --> 1158.3700000000001
course you're gonna see it the visual

1156.54 --> 1161.22
spectacle is gonna give a response but

1158.37 --> 1164.85
if you would not see it you will feel

1161.22 --> 1168.03
the pressure Ripple

1164.85 --> 1170.3999999999999
once that new body enters the water and

1168.03 --> 1175.82
forces the whole thing to displace its

1170.4 --> 1179.5800000000002
freshest you feel that you understand

1175.82 --> 1182.85
so yeah the whole body of water because

1179.58 --> 1185.28
it isn't compressible it shifts

1182.85 --> 1191.6899999999998
uniformly when it is forced to displace

1185.28 --> 1191.69
by something that is more dense than it

1216.2 --> 1221.019
yeah well Philip Cooper yeah you see

1219.259 --> 1224.419
that's the whole thing

1221.019 --> 1228.109
you people obsess so much about this

1224.419 --> 1230.8690000000001
childish notions why why why why the

1228.109 --> 1235.4189999999999
direction why the direction and there is

1230.869 --> 1238.4889999999998
no distinct direct answer for it that

1235.419 --> 1243.429
yeah that goes into absolutes in

1238.489 --> 1248.019
absolute knowledge and because of that

1243.429 --> 1250.94
you allow yourself to be fooled by

1248.019 --> 1253.179
Wizards that tell you oh yeah that

1250.94 --> 1256.6000000000001
direction right that what you see all

1253.179 --> 1261.049
its it's not always like this it's like

1256.6 --> 1263.6
yes and it's all pointing towards the

1261.049 --> 1265.85
center of a ball that that's what they

1263.6 --> 1270.9189999999999
make you imagine and because we have no

1265.85 --> 1273.4989999999998
very solid answer as to why this

1270.919 --> 1274.6390000000001
specifically we can't physically prove

1273.499 --> 1278.8990000000001
that at this time

1274.639 --> 1282.139
and you allow yourself to be fooled by

1278.899 --> 1284.779
your ball religion saying that this axis

1282.139 --> 1289.149
is all pointing towards the center of a

1284.779 --> 1293.69
big ball that's what you do we know it

1289.149 --> 1297.649
would be good if you'd know it if you

1293.69 --> 1299.3200000000002
realize that you were doing that it'll

1297.649 --> 1302.4199999999998
help yourself

1299.32 --> 1302.4199999999998
[Music]

1303.529 --> 1310.009
anyway chat is lively today

1333.529 --> 1336.529
huh

1339.04 --> 1352.6499999999999
oh damn I see it my side chat is stuck

1343.03 --> 1352.6499999999999
again stupid thing I don't get it

1358.03 --> 1362.01
I don't get why does that

1374.83 --> 1378.51
how did I fix it yesterday

1385.3 --> 1388.26
I don't remember

1404.57 --> 1412.999
oh wait this is it yes it was the

1408.769 --> 1417.289
refresh alright yeah thanks for pointing

1412.999 --> 1420.369
it out bit late

1417.289 --> 1420.369
but oh well

1424.13 --> 1426.94
right

1433.24 --> 1436.34
right

1434.419 --> 1439.21
yeah the Adamic and what I have to do

1436.34 --> 1442.58
every time is just go into the chat and

1439.21 --> 1445.94
of course copy the whole thing for it to

1442.58 --> 1451.6399999999999
work and that works but then I yeah when

1445.94 --> 1458.96
I get stuck I have to press refresh the

1451.64 --> 1462.3700000000001
input there is a special button no just

1458.96 --> 1462.3700000000001
getting used to all the routines

1469.52 --> 1476.47
so yeah I am open for guests by the way

1472.19 --> 1476.47
it is of course Saturday

1483.46 --> 1487.96
yeah I know Adam I don't know why it

1485.74 --> 1493.24
gets stuck it just seems to do that

1487.96 --> 1499.3
sometimes you know it's I'm used to this

1493.24 --> 1501.46
stuff I just have to know the routines

1499.3 --> 1505.33
and then you can quick I can quickly fix

1501.46 --> 1507.88
it if I get pointed at it if I if it's

1505.33 --> 1512.77
the hard to take note is because the

1507.88 --> 1515.71
chats in the actual YouTube video looks

1512.77 --> 1518.2
so different from the YouTube chat so

1515.71 --> 1525.22
it's hard to recognize that it's not the

1518.2 --> 1527.95
same mmm yeah lots of people in chat by

1525.22 --> 1533.64
the way hello sorry bear

1527.95 --> 1533.64
Aaron Johnson the red path

1533.79 --> 1539.61
sorry to Cosentino car stand back

1543.08 --> 1549.739
omona king dank and thanks for reminding

1549.23 --> 1553.879
me

1549.739 --> 1563.539
oh damn you've been reminding me for a

1553.879 --> 1566.48
while didn't pick up on it hmmm alright

1563.539 --> 1570.7
I saw a good question there by the way a

1566.48 --> 1573.83
question that bothers me as well the

1570.7 --> 1576.049
behavior of gas particles and the

1573.83 --> 1580.1589999999999
assumption that it's all bouncing around

1576.049 --> 1584.559
them lead in all directions again I've

1580.159 --> 1584.5590000000002
said this before I think this is a a

1585.039 --> 1591.529
conceptualization to try and make us

1588.139 --> 1598.7299999999998
understand how it works I don't think it

1591.529 --> 1601.549
is all literal I think gas probably in

1598.73 --> 1606.309
its own way has much more of a mashing a

1601.549 --> 1609.1689999999999
MASH property like water and liquids

1606.309 --> 1612.009
with the only difference it just spreads

1609.169 --> 1612.009
out in all directions

1615.49 --> 1622.33
but yeah it's just I don't really have

1619.51 --> 1624.669
anything sensible to replace it with if

1622.33 --> 1627.8799999999999
I did conceive of something it would

1624.669 --> 1632.669
probably be pretty damn complex I think

1627.88 --> 1632.669
if they're if I'll even get there

1651.98 --> 1656.059
that right but Bill Thompson that is not

1655.46 --> 1660.6490000000001
true

1656.059 --> 1661.7
paradoxes nonsense absolute nonsense the

1660.649 --> 1665.1789999999999
thing about it

1661.7 --> 1668.269
the thing about randomness and if you're

1665.179 --> 1673.0700000000002
if you have an actual brain you should

1668.269 --> 1678.6490000000001
know this actual randomness on a vast

1673.07 --> 1683.4189999999999
scale creates statistical reliable

1678.649 --> 1687.289
averages yeah so random on one scale is

1683.419 --> 1691.929
not random on another scale and that is

1687.289 --> 1696.98
that's natural consequence is kind of

1691.929 --> 1701.8700000000001
configured in it because random is not

1696.98 --> 1708.73
really random so need random where it's

1701.87 --> 1708.7299999999998
random random is a matter of perspective

1719.27 --> 1729.35
yeah bill Thompson but it does it does

1722.9 --> 1733.73
move in all directions it tries to fill

1729.35 --> 1739.8799999999999
the space with the best speed it can

1733.73 --> 1742.88
find it tries to spread out and hey if

1739.88 --> 1745.8200000000002
it goes up apparently it goes slower on

1742.88 --> 1746.5700000000002
average the spreading out of pressure go

1745.82 --> 1749.4199999999998
slower

1746.57 --> 1751.1899999999998
apparently upwards then it does in the

1749.42 --> 1753.77
other direction so yeah I'll go with

1751.19 --> 1754.25
that does it mean that it won't do it

1753.77 --> 1757.4
though

1754.25 --> 1761.679
it just there's a difference in the

1757.4 --> 1761.679
speed that's it

1767.69 --> 1771.16
this yeah

1781.75 --> 1784.5
hmm

1788.76 --> 1799.35
now shut up Bill Thompson okay Nathan

1796.64 --> 1801.48
you'll have my full permission to

1799.35 --> 1803.1499999999999
timeout anybody in chat that is

1801.48 --> 1807.63
personally attacking you

1803.15 --> 1810.0590000000002
only if it's very obvious because I'm

1807.63 --> 1811.65
noticing that they're yeah they're all

1810.059 --> 1816.53
trying to pile onto you

1811.65 --> 1819.3600000000001
that's just jealous but we all know that

1816.53 --> 1829.6499999999999
yeah you had a huge pile of super chat

1819.36 --> 1832.6789999999999
yesterday no no bill Thompson now when

1829.65 --> 1836.66
Nathan actually addresses you on your

1832.679 --> 1839.49
[ __ ] claims much more harshly more

1836.66 --> 1842.39
emphasizing the [ __ ] part and the

1839.49 --> 1846.48
foolish part and yet you're just wrong

1842.39 --> 1848.88
instead of what I do and just be a

1846.48 --> 1853.14
little bit more gracious about it a

1848.88 --> 1856.0490000000002
little or indulging in the hopes that

1853.14 --> 1858.48
you can somehow overcome your idiocy

1856.049 --> 1863.37
that's the difference between Nathan and

1858.48 --> 1867.799
me and that's not attacking you it's

1863.37 --> 1867.799
just being a little bit more real

1886.8 --> 1899.27
I don't need to read the chats bill

1890.58 --> 1901.59
Thompson you might not have noticed but

1899.27 --> 1905.25
have to hang out so far I've been

1901.59 --> 1908.6699999999998
addressing your claims what you've been

1905.25 --> 1910.53
saying explaining upon that I don't need

1908.67 --> 1913.8300000000002
to read the chats of what went down

1910.53 --> 1921.3899999999999
between you and Nathan to know that

1913.83 --> 1926.01
you're just totally wrong yeah what's

1921.39 --> 1928.5900000000001
the problem with that I think that

1926.01 --> 1933.69
Nathan was pretty spot on there with

1928.59 --> 1934.1399999999999
Phil because I don't really like Phil at

1933.69 --> 1937.29
all

1934.14 --> 1944.8400000000001
Phil Cooper seems to be just a typical

1937.29 --> 1948.6
stupid baller and hey if Nathan wants to

1944.84 --> 1952.8
express his views and how he sees

1948.6 --> 1958.05
Phillip then why not you people do it

1952.8 --> 1962.3
all the time I don't know if he's ugly

1958.05 --> 1962.3
or old but I don't really care

1967.52 --> 1977.4
okay well piss off there and yeah come

1974.19 --> 1984.27
back with a less ugly ass troll account

1977.4 --> 1986.8200000000002
next time just ramming your hands on

1984.27 --> 1989.9
your keyboard as a as an account name

1986.82 --> 1989.8999999999999
doesn't really do it

2030.73 --> 2040.8700000000001
no bill Thompson there is no paradox

2034.69 --> 2044.92
there bill Thompson because how the gas

2040.87 --> 2048.04
particles travel is still dependent on

2044.92 --> 2054.4900000000002
the gradient which is dependent on the

2048.04 --> 2057.06
size of the container there is no

2054.49 --> 2057.06
paradox

2059.1 --> 2075.61
stop being a ridiculous fantasies bill

2063.04 --> 2079.39
Cooper Bill Thompson sorry it doesn't

2075.61 --> 2083.65
matter if Nathan agrees or not Bill

2079.39 --> 2087.19
Thompson it's all dependent on the

2083.65 --> 2089.53
gradient which is dependent on the size

2087.19 --> 2096.82
of the container stop being a freaking

2089.53 --> 2099.84
[ __ ] he doesn't have a paradox it it's

2096.82 --> 2099.84
not relevant

2123.64 --> 2126.5989999999997
mm-hmm

2142.12 --> 2144.7799999999997
nah

2145.89 --> 2149.0989999999997
don't worry

2159.54 --> 2162.909
[Music]

2188.32 --> 2193.17
mmm

2190.83 --> 2197.33
the curvature where well that would

2193.17 --> 2204.14
probably be Jason mcCormick is that you

2197.33 --> 2210.2999999999997
since you are using capital letters

2204.14 --> 2214.62
that's your little little creepy little

2210.3 --> 2217.98
mark like you always have to prove that

2214.62 --> 2220.14
it is actually you like a certain

2217.98 --> 2224.33
category of people that typically do

2220.14 --> 2224.33
that that I absolutely despise

2234.33 --> 2239.98
just reveal yourself buddy just throw

2237.37 --> 2242.83
out your happy concave weak [ __ ] so

2239.98 --> 2245.01
I can find you again it's never going to

2242.83 --> 2245.0099999999998
end

2264.579 --> 2272.92
good yeah Philip Cooper one day this

2269.529 --> 2275.709
will all fall into place and some of you

2272.92 --> 2279.009
are going to feel rather silly now

2275.709 --> 2281.439
actually you're you're giving a perfect

2279.009 --> 2283.869
description as to what you will one day

2281.439 --> 2288.189
undergo because that is exactly what's

2283.869 --> 2293.4390000000003
going to happen but you're still too

2288.189 --> 2296.319
arrogant and cowardice to see that we

2293.439 --> 2298.569
all know all of your arguments all of

2296.319 --> 2301.089
the evidence that you claim to have and

2298.569 --> 2303.999
you think is so big we all look through

2301.089 --> 2307.66
it all of it we all point it at every

2303.999 --> 2310.479
detail and more and try to argue about

2307.66 --> 2312.3089999999997
the details with all of you and then all

2310.479 --> 2317.4689999999996
of you proceeded to either step away or

2312.309 --> 2319.3590000000004
just claim that we didn't get it red

2317.469 --> 2322.119
herring the [ __ ] out of everything we

2319.359 --> 2324.8489999999997
know all of your information and your

2322.119 --> 2327.4590000000003
entire religion and its mechanics so

2324.849 --> 2333.429
much more better than you do and there

2327.459 --> 2335.14
is no chance in heaven or hell that

2333.429 --> 2339.719
that's going to be the other way around

2335.14 --> 2339.719
ever never ever

2355.68 --> 2360.5699999999997
[Music]

2357.92 --> 2363.56
yeah what about my arguments Ragnar

2360.57 --> 2363.56
Steffen Alderson

2366.52 --> 2369.63
[Music]

2375.47 --> 2382.8489999999997
Wow and as I put down the piece of text

2379.369 --> 2386.54
as I put it down it's so funny you know

2382.849 --> 2388.31
sometimes I don't even have to finish

2386.54 --> 2390.5
the sentence in which I make a

2388.31 --> 2393.14
prediction in order for that prediction

2390.5 --> 2395.75
to just instantly come true just

2393.14 --> 2399.14
instantly the behavior shows itself like

2395.75 --> 2405.17
a virtue signal to your people to to

2399.14 --> 2412.99
bite in the traps you're such animals

2405.17 --> 2416.84
you're such just bass-driven animals

2412.99 --> 2419.93
like you have absolutely no control over

2416.84 --> 2423.349
what drives you at all you're just being

2419.93 --> 2425.72
driven by a program and you have no

2423.349 --> 2428.6800000000003
sensibilities about your responses

2425.72 --> 2432.91
whatsoever the only thing that really

2428.68 --> 2435.2
determines what you do is that neurotic

2432.91 --> 2437.7799999999997
programming that just promises you

2435.2 --> 2440.96
things will be all right and it's not

2437.78 --> 2443.5890000000004
it's a lie all of it and it's gonna run

2440.96 --> 2446.9
out of steam and you're gonna feel

2443.589 --> 2452.63
really ugly and disgusting and stained

2446.9 --> 2454.96
and raped by the own lies that you

2452.63 --> 2454.96
bought

2467.65 --> 2473.23
and not even because of the lies just

2469.54 --> 2476.41
because of how full-on and you went and

2473.23 --> 2478.18
it really does seem almost like a rape

2476.41 --> 2482.73
it yeah

2478.18 --> 2485.9199999999996
it's almost like somebody did that and

2482.73 --> 2489.45
then told you like it was for some

2485.92 --> 2492.88
greater purpose and you bought it and

2489.45 --> 2497.6499999999996
then you held on to that your entire

2492.88 --> 2500.29
life like trying to move around it but

2497.65 --> 2503.53
still believing it until one day it just

2500.29 --> 2506.14
smacks you in the face and then you

2503.53 --> 2511.6800000000003
realize oh my god what did I do

2506.14 --> 2515.47
I feel tainted by delusion I feel like

2511.68 --> 2519.49
much much worse than probably did at the

2515.47 --> 2522.3999999999996
time when the illusion arrived because

2519.49 --> 2526.2999999999997
you held onto it for so long you let it

2522.4 --> 2528.73
hurt you unwittingly for so long that

2526.3 --> 2532.77
does the real damage much more than the

2528.73 --> 2532.77
acts that spawned it

2539.26 --> 2564.9300000000003
it's tough fortunately that's just the

2549.609 --> 2569.1
way this world works we are all farmers

2564.93 --> 2569.1
sheep and hunters

2590.56 --> 2596.56
yeah this is just that's not a question

2594.25 --> 2601.63
Ragnar Stefan hell - and that is a pure

2596.56 --> 2605.14
met a meta a question and then a

2601.63 --> 2607.15
conclusion literally based on a hollow

2605.14 --> 2609.2999999999997
question that didn't actually ask a

2607.15 --> 2611.89
question this is just [ __ ]

2609.3 --> 2616.8300000000004
why didn't you actually ask a question

2611.89 --> 2616.83
instead of spiraling into some inward

2616.95 --> 2619.95
weirdness

2625.73 --> 2628.78
oh my god

2635.76 --> 2642.9900000000002
yeah yeah I can record stuff in Alderson

2638.64 --> 2644.7
oh yes I've been extremely flexible with

2642.99 --> 2648.06
my belief throughout my life and I've

2644.7 --> 2650.64
switched into many different directions

2648.06 --> 2654.99
sometimes big switches back and forth

2650.64 --> 2660.359
and currently really I'm trying to find

2654.99 --> 2663.5699999999997
the best middle path I can find but I

2660.359 --> 2665.97
have to heat that from whatever I've

2663.57 --> 2668.7000000000003
learned that it is also from a certain

2665.97 --> 2671.58
perspective and I cannot conceive all

2668.7 --> 2672.6
the angles to it on the longer run and

2671.58 --> 2678.119
that's why I have to be much more

2672.6 --> 2684.7799999999997
careful as to what I take as a baseline

2678.119 --> 2695.01
belief and add it I take less and less

2684.78 --> 2702.3590000000004
for granted I let go of more beliefs as

2695.01 --> 2705.3900000000003
I go and then replace it by it being a

2702.359 --> 2711.9
concept for example just a story concept

2705.39 --> 2715.2599999999998
that has a certain power because these

2711.9 --> 2718.4100000000003
things do and that's then how I treat it

2715.26 --> 2722.4500000000003
instead instead of truly believing it as

2718.41 --> 2726.06
some kind of almost religious fanatical

2722.45 --> 2728.31
belief about it and hunger for the

2726.06 --> 2732.06
energy and that frequency instead I just

2728.31 --> 2734.79
take it as a concept and don't anchor my

2732.06 --> 2739.08
very existence into it that's the

2734.79 --> 2742.49
difference because I had a lot of very

2739.08 --> 2745.5
powerful personal beliefs very powerful

2742.49 --> 2749.1
that I was very personally zealous about

2745.5 --> 2755.01
and careful with with the outside world

2749.1 --> 2758.19
because yeah and but before I even came

2755.01 --> 2760.71
onto the scene here onto YouTube way

2758.19 --> 2763.07
before that I've already dealt with most

2760.71 --> 2763.07
of them

2766.83 --> 2775.54
and yeah it for example last two years I

2772.56 --> 2778.54
let go of another belief the belief in

2775.54 --> 2781.0
gravity and I truly figured out that the

2778.54 --> 2793.15
conceptualization is an aberration and

2781.0 --> 2796.09
not routed in reality Jesus Christ what

2793.15 --> 2798.19
the hell's up with you can you please

2796.09 --> 2811.51
get your heads out of the gutter for

2798.19 --> 2814.11
freaking out people come on come on

2811.51 --> 2814.11
Nathan

2821.4 --> 2826.109
stop kicking the bum please

2830.15 --> 2836.4100000000003
well be rational through trial and error

2833.329 --> 2839.4500000000003
and an important factor for

2836.41 --> 2843.2889999999998
understanding beliefs is the results and

2839.45 --> 2846.3799999999997
letting it sink in much of beliefs are

2843.289 --> 2848.7490000000003
about the consequences of it all it

2846.38 --> 2855.23
provides a certain energy and strength

2848.749 --> 2860.1189999999997
and purpose but you require wisdom and

2855.23 --> 2863.39
life experience to see where how the how

2860.119 --> 2865.7000000000003
the direction really happens because you

2863.39 --> 2867.019
have to understand where it goes and you

2865.7 --> 2870.3689999999997
can't understand that

2867.019 --> 2873.319
when you don't have enough experience

2870.369 --> 2880.4500000000003
you have to experience things to

2873.319 --> 2880.45
understand them to truly understand

2890.059 --> 2900.5190000000002
well be rational if you really want to

2893.389 --> 2906.429
know I had pretty like megalomaniacal

2900.519 --> 2909.589
beliefs not severe ones but just and

2906.429 --> 2910.699
people are much more prone to that than

2909.589 --> 2914.569
you might imagine

2910.699 --> 2916.579
and I've expressed those beliefs and

2914.569 --> 2920.359
I've even tried to do things with that

2916.579 --> 2923.119
and as I expressed them more and more

2920.359 --> 2927.439
even trying to be modest in a way I just

2923.119 --> 2929.6290000000004
noticed that people that the energy

2927.439 --> 2933.859
stability with the contact it would

2929.629 --> 2936.3089999999997
break it would start to slowly slowly

2933.859 --> 2938.8089999999997
gradually disintegrate and people would

2936.309 --> 2942.5890000000004
some for some reason that even by

2938.809 --> 2945.0190000000002
personal choice just lose their energy

2942.589 --> 2947.689
for me that's one of the ways that I

2945.019 --> 2952.939
figured out like this is wrong it

2947.689 --> 2956.4089999999997
doesn't work it's not supposed to be

2952.939 --> 2964.749
like that it's an illusion

2956.409 --> 2964.7490000000003
oversimplification get the [ __ ] out here

2967.44 --> 2975.009
so that is one of the ways yeah

2972.519 --> 2979.8689999999997
trial and error you figure out what you

2975.009 --> 2982.029
do wrong also one of the bigger trial

2979.869 --> 2984.339
and error things that I learned over my

2982.029 --> 2988.989
life is that even though my intuition

2984.339 --> 2992.969
can be extremely useful and helpful for

2988.989 --> 2996.339
me to improvise in situations like to a

2992.969 --> 2998.859
miraculous level for me I find it like

2996.339 --> 3004.41
incredible what comes out of me at times

2998.859 --> 3007.16
if I forced to improvise but I trusted

3004.41 --> 3011.7
on I figured this skill out pretty young

3007.16 --> 3016.6189999999997
like really young it was fascinating but

3011.7 --> 3020.519
it also made me too reliant on it what

3016.619 --> 3025.5190000000002
it did is make me lazy over reliant upon

3020.519 --> 3028.2889999999998
that skill and made me lose interest in

3025.519 --> 3033.8689999999997
actually figuring out the technicals of

3028.289 --> 3036.1800000000003
the outside world and therefore caused a

3033.869 --> 3039.1800000000003
huge amount of problems even though the

3036.18 --> 3043.8489999999997
improvisation always made me able to get

3039.18 --> 3048.66
by it broke

3043.849 --> 3050.549
much of my interest in the world because

3048.66 --> 3053.819
I thought I don't really need to know it

3050.549 --> 3057.39
I'm just gonna get by anyway and then

3053.819 --> 3059.0389999999998
yeah I had it is ridiculous because at

3057.39 --> 3061.3799999999997
the time especially when I was young I

3059.039 --> 3063.69
really believed it I really believed

3061.38 --> 3066.2690000000002
that I didn't need to know ever it was

3063.69 --> 3067.829
like it's all gonna change anyway why

3066.269 --> 3069.7189999999996
would I memorize any of it it's all

3067.829 --> 3075.989
gonna be useless much of what I'm gonna

3069.719 --> 3077.819
learn and now now in the meantime in a

3075.989 --> 3083.069
long period of time thirty years

3077.819 --> 3085.44
something I bumped my head to my

3083.069 --> 3088.65
temporary in my lack of the temporary

3085.44 --> 3090.96
world so many times that it just was

3088.65 --> 3095.9500000000003
forced upon me that it is just a huge

3090.96 --> 3099.67
mistake that was unavoidable in a way

3095.95 --> 3102.79
the for me to go through all that but

3099.67 --> 3106.2400000000002
that my improvisation is really

3102.79 --> 3108.43
secondary and that I do need to use my

3106.24 --> 3110.62
wider intellect and other skills my

3108.43 --> 3114.31
visualizations is I kind of found the

3110.62 --> 3116.29
entrance for how to do it how to absorb

3114.31 --> 3119.32
all this temporary information of the

3116.29 --> 3122.98
changing world by strengthening my

3119.32 --> 3127.65
visualization capacity and oversight is

3122.98 --> 3130.2400000000002
structuring and building in my mind

3127.65 --> 3132.85
because that is what I spent a lot of my

3130.24 --> 3136.33
time on as I was young as a personal

3132.85 --> 3141.16
skill to refine and yeah now I'm using

3136.33 --> 3144.49
that play skill to subtly be able to

3141.16 --> 3146.3199999999997
assimilate materials of the world much

3144.49 --> 3148.8399999999997
better and place them very quickly

3146.32 --> 3152.11
without having to meticulously study

3148.84 --> 3154.3
[ __ ] and like memorize it no don't need

3152.11 --> 3156.28
to do that just have all these building

3154.3 --> 3161.32
blocks in this playground that is there

3156.28 --> 3165.19
forever as long as I live and that's my

3161.32 --> 3168.06
angle to fix it all and then my

3165.19 --> 3172.54
improvisation is like a blessing that

3168.06 --> 3175.39
comes secondary and it must not fall

3172.54 --> 3177.37
into the trap of completely relying upon

3175.39 --> 3182.8599999999997
it again it's very important that I keep

3177.37 --> 3185.97
on planning and grabbing things from the

3182.86 --> 3190.06
outside world and develop some of that

3185.97 --> 3193.33
because for me a lot of people just do

3190.06 --> 3196.96
this automated for me not so much I

3193.33 --> 3201.4
don't do a lot of new things by myself

3196.96 --> 3204.43
because again improvisation doesn't make

3201.4 --> 3206.71
it necessary for me but I got to do it

3204.43 --> 3210.33
anyway that's what I've learned and

3206.71 --> 3210.33
they've got to learn a lot more about it

3212.28 --> 3220.57
so yeah I'm gonna round out the show the

3216.25 --> 3223.96
chat is all crazy anyway but yeah things

3220.57 --> 3228.13
that I've learned a lot so it's always

3223.96 --> 3229.509
funny when ballers in like this huge

3228.13 --> 3232.869
huge dip

3229.509 --> 3235.329
of desperation is there hurts that I'm

3232.869 --> 3237.429
actually addressing their real problems

3235.329 --> 3241.139
as they're doing the stooping packing

3237.429 --> 3249.1890000000003
back and forth fight with other people

3241.139 --> 3251.259
yeah go [ __ ] yourself Jose stupid troll

3249.189 --> 3257.199
piece of [ __ ] I'm never coming to your

3251.259 --> 3259.509
channel again you're the worst your

3257.199 --> 3263.409
entire channel is [ __ ] your guests are

3259.509 --> 3264.429
[ __ ] you're managing skills have become

3263.409 --> 3267.13
[ __ ]

3264.429 --> 3270.059
your attitude is [ __ ] your [ __ ] Jose

3267.13 --> 3270.059
piss off

3280.63 --> 3297.83
that was Jose it's just I you know this

3295.85 --> 3300.68
is a pretty rough statement of me to

3297.83 --> 3304.09
make but I'd rather watch a Simon than

3300.68 --> 3307.64
video then go back to Jose's okay and

3304.09 --> 3322.7200000000003
most of you know how brutal that

3307.64 --> 3330.7999999999997
comparison is you know it all right

3322.72 --> 3333.62
anyway so ridiculous fathers are

3330.8 --> 3337.28
ridiculous anyway as I was saying before

3333.62 --> 3339.5899999999997
I completely ran out to show it's always

3337.28 --> 3343.7900000000004
good to see that when I really push down

3339.59 --> 3346.55
onto the the real core elements that

3343.79 --> 3350.57
bother ballers why they feel even stuck

3346.55 --> 3353.2400000000002
into what they are I can go there and

3350.57 --> 3356.63
they don't like it so then they try to

3353.24 --> 3358.3399999999997
do the same thing to me by trying to

3356.63 --> 3361.07
zoom in and all the things that I

3358.34 --> 3365.69
honestly have shared about myself and

3361.07 --> 3370.34
try to point at some huge more brooding

3365.69 --> 3372.73
deep flaw that person people would never

3370.34 --> 3376.4300000000003
inquire that about other people unless

3372.73 --> 3379.7
it was a super open atmosphere that was

3376.43 --> 3381.5
very comfortable normal people don't do

3379.7 --> 3384.2
that but they do it as an attack they

3381.5 --> 3386.51
asked very deep personal question as an

3384.2 --> 3387.5299999999997
attack because they feel hurt and they

3386.51 --> 3391.4
want to hurt me too

3387.53 --> 3394.2200000000003
but the result is I actually take it as

3391.4 --> 3399.7400000000002
an inspiration and then elaborately

3394.22 --> 3405.52
answer it for like 10 or 50 minutes just

3399.74 --> 3408.04
to show them you have nothing not a word

3405.52 --> 3413.44
not a thought

3408.04 --> 3419.2
not a feeling that can touch me not a

3413.44 --> 3424.03
word not for real only thing that gets

3419.2 --> 3429.21
to me is what me and my issues with

3424.03 --> 3430.42
myself allow me to be touched by this

3429.21 --> 3433.09
bottom-feeding

3430.42 --> 3434.92
[ __ ] that is just so below my

3433.09 --> 3439.08
intellectual and spiritual level it

3434.92 --> 3444.1
really is not worth looking into it much

3439.08 --> 3446.46
accept accept just put it out there as a

3444.1 --> 3449.88
showcase and to help other people

3446.46 --> 3453.79
understand what is going on how can

3449.88 --> 3456.04
people be this insane don't be dragged

3453.79 --> 3459.82
down with it don't let it normalize

3456.04 --> 3463.84
insanity to you it is not normal it is a

3459.82 --> 3467.17
big big problem with you anity huge

3463.84 --> 3469.4500000000003
problem and it's gonna get worse don't

3467.17 --> 3474.51
be dragged down with it don't let it

3469.45 --> 3480.8199999999997
normalize insanity to you don't do it

3474.51 --> 3483.63
keep to yourself keep to your own human

3480.82 --> 3483.63
directions

3483.69 --> 3490.93
don't let it normalize nastiness right

3488.52 --> 3496.0
so I am definitely gonna round up the

3490.93 --> 3497.71
show now thanks everyone for coming if
