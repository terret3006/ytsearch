still use the support

128.399 --> 135.2
right anyway the weather today

131.94 --> 135.2
it's really kind of beautiful

135.66 --> 142.2
it's a bit windy more than yesterday

139.44 --> 144.78
still clouded a bit but less it seems

142.2 --> 146.76
and there's been a real nice sunny spot

144.78 --> 151.52
here

146.76 --> 151.51999999999998
in the last hour and before that too

152.34 --> 155.12
look at this

159.42 --> 162.73899999999998
isn't that look incredible

164.13 --> 167.76999999999998
[Music]

175.08 --> 178.4
quite beautiful right

189.68 --> 193.22
all right so

193.62 --> 199.92000000000002
hello fluffy snow first in chat Moxie

196.739 --> 205.92000000000002
Richard G good to see you

199.92 --> 205.92
it is Wednesday the 26th of July 2023

206.819 --> 213.17999999999998
I think the temperature is probably

209.519 --> 213.18
around 2021

214.739 --> 220.879
oh 19.

218.4 --> 220.87900000000002
okay

225.659 --> 229.739
it's actually decently warm I'm not in

228.239 --> 232.28
my shorts though

229.739 --> 232.28
just

232.5 --> 236.819
I mean as soon as the sun is not hitting

234.84 --> 237.9
this wall anymore it's gonna drop in

236.819 --> 240.89999999999998
temperature

237.9 --> 242.459
ear so

240.9 --> 246.799
I'm just gonna

242.459 --> 246.799
this anyway how are you guys doing

247.08 --> 253.019
it's been kind of a late night

249.72 --> 255.659
for a lot of you I think because fpd was

253.019 --> 259.94
no fpd but Nathan did start up like a

255.659 --> 259.94
members only live stream extremely late

261.419 --> 267.65999999999997
like uh at basically at the end of Huey

266.04 --> 269.88
live

267.66 --> 273.139
and then went on like to three o'clock

269.88 --> 273.139
or something really late

276.72 --> 281.759
yeah

279.02 --> 284.0
so I'm glad to have some of you at least

281.759 --> 284.0
here

286.38 --> 288.979
right

291.8 --> 295.009
[Music]

302.4 --> 308.75899999999996
anyway I'm feeling kind of strong

306.0 --> 311.36
did the technique yesterday very

308.759 --> 311.36
elaborately

312.18 --> 317.34000000000003
like I made some real effort like even

315.419 --> 320.82
weirdly like

317.34 --> 323.75899999999996
I had this momentum going at some point

320.82 --> 327.62
I didn't know why it it was working so

323.759 --> 327.62
strong as it did yesterday night

328.44 --> 332.639
but

330.0 --> 335.039
yeah I including like

332.639 --> 337.56
I basically

335.039 --> 342.12
projected good weather and felt all

337.56 --> 344.1
kinds of stuff happening when I did that

342.12 --> 346.68
like it felt like there I was like

344.1 --> 350.41900000000004
projecting a beam of energy just in the

346.68 --> 350.419
air it was just happening

350.58 --> 357.419
and well it was forecast to be just

354.6 --> 360.47900000000004
mostly cloudy and raining and it hasn't

357.419 --> 361.979
been like that so far it almost seems

360.479 --> 364.56
like

361.979 --> 366.65999999999997
I'm surrounded by clouds at the Horizon

364.56 --> 368.46
but over here it's all beautiful and

366.66 --> 370.02000000000004
blue

368.46 --> 371.96
like there's a hole

370.02 --> 374.52
it's very odd

371.96 --> 377.039
but I did actually kind of expect

374.52 --> 378.96
something like that because

377.039 --> 380.759
when I did that projection thing

378.96 --> 384.29999999999995
yesterday

380.759 --> 387.78000000000003
like forecast or yeah it's like

384.3 --> 390.18
praying for tomorrow

387.78 --> 391.08
but like with the technique surrounding

390.18 --> 395.3
it

391.08 --> 395.3
instead of some standardized prayer

396.0 --> 400.199
and

397.62 --> 402.5
well things happened I could feel them

400.199 --> 402.5
happen

404.4 --> 408.29999999999995
but I could already kind of feel that

406.08 --> 411.419
even before

408.3 --> 412.919
when I started because there was just as

411.419 --> 415.31899999999996
I was doing it it's like I got

412.919 --> 417.59999999999997
distraction like Suddenly It's Like Whoa

415.319 --> 419.759
you get pulled into into something

417.6 --> 422.28000000000003
moving that's happening

419.759 --> 424.5
that's what it felt like doesn't really

422.28 --> 427.31899999999996
feel like that a lot

424.5 --> 429.9
but sometimes it do it it does and it's

427.319 --> 431.699
almost like magic happens it's really

429.9 --> 433.62
bizarre and you can just like make a

431.699 --> 436.22
wish and it'll just come true like sort

433.62 --> 436.22
of like that

437.9 --> 442.13899999999995
and that seemed to happen yesterday

440.039 --> 444.78
night

442.139 --> 447.66
and so I got great weather and I feel

444.78 --> 450.23999999999995
good and I feel much stronger I really I

447.66 --> 453.139
am trying to kind of like put this

450.24 --> 453.139
frequency

453.36 --> 457.56
that I went through on that Waldorf

455.819 --> 459.72
School which I've been focusing on on my

457.56 --> 461.88
shows a lot kind of trying to put it

459.72 --> 466.16
behind me because

461.88 --> 466.15999999999997
it has shaken me up a little bit

466.259 --> 470.34000000000003
because I'm getting so close

468.79 --> 472.8
[Music]

470.34 --> 475.08
normally like most of my life I just

472.8 --> 477.599
kind of stared at it from a distance and

475.08 --> 480.3
now I was really like trying to get back

477.599 --> 482.099
in what it was like and why I was acting

480.3 --> 484.68
that way and like what was that feeling

482.099 --> 487.699
really like why was I having these

484.68 --> 487.699
nightmares and stuff

487.8 --> 493.74
and remembering like actually getting so

490.68 --> 496.46
[ __ ] up that I I was like fantasizing

493.74 --> 496.46000000000004
killing these

498.18 --> 501.68
skits that were my own age

503.4 --> 507.35999999999996
and then eventually getting snapped out

505.8 --> 509.94
of it

507.36 --> 511.91900000000004
which I'm very happy that I did snap out

509.94 --> 514.5
of that

511.919 --> 517.909
because it was yeah

514.5 --> 517.909
[Music]

518.18 --> 523.8
but like going through that again also

521.76 --> 526.02
well rubbed off some of that

523.8 --> 528.4799999999999
vulnerability that I really used to have

526.02 --> 530.8199999999999
I used to be like much more vulnerable

528.48 --> 533.82
than I'm now when I was a kid I didn't

530.82 --> 538.339
have all these things that I really

533.82 --> 538.339
built through experience and exposure

538.74 --> 542.7
I mean yes the last 10 years I have not

541.5 --> 546.54
been out

542.7 --> 549.24
about people very much

546.54 --> 553.38
but to be fair

549.24 --> 558.019
before 10 years ago I never been

553.38 --> 558.019
on the internet as much like this

559.019 --> 563.94
I mean

560.64 --> 567.54
15 years ago yeah I would like check out

563.94 --> 569.7
a video YouTube video sometimes if it

567.54 --> 573.3
there's like a news article and it's

569.7 --> 575.82
linking to a YouTube video like that

573.3 --> 578.3389999999999
or sometimes I would get curious and

575.82 --> 582.0600000000001
just dig into weird conspiracy videos

578.339 --> 585.3000000000001
like is Earth blowing up like or is it

582.06 --> 588.1199999999999
shrinking that sort of thing but

585.3 --> 591.3
I didn't really spend a lot of time like

588.12 --> 593.22
following people's activities

591.3 --> 595.4399999999999
like I have

593.22 --> 597.779
since I basically came to YouTube myself

595.44 --> 600.019
before that I really didn't do it that

597.779 --> 600.019
much

602.519 --> 608.7
and before that I was just I got my

605.58 --> 610.5600000000001
social interactions through like going

608.7 --> 612.839
out

610.56 --> 615.0189999999999
and just starting conversations with

612.839 --> 615.019
people

615.779 --> 620.12
like at the grocery store that sort of

618.0 --> 620.12
thing

626.279 --> 630.06
which worked great when I was with my ex

628.62 --> 632.94
by the way because

630.06 --> 635.459
I mean she gave like being with her gave

632.94 --> 636.6600000000001
me like a lot of confidence

635.459 --> 639.06
like

636.66 --> 642.24
very easy confidence and it didn't even

639.06 --> 644.3389999999999
like have to have I didn't like need

642.24 --> 646.98
people to see like oh it's really my

644.339 --> 648.72
girlfriend no it's just just being there

646.98 --> 651.1800000000001
with her and

648.72 --> 652.98
that she was with me gave me a lot of

651.18 --> 657.019
confidence and that made socializing

652.98 --> 657.019
just a lot easier too

657.42 --> 662.459
although I feel that at this point I I

660.72 --> 664.37
probably have the same level of

662.459 --> 667.9799999999999
confidence

664.37 --> 667.98
[Music]

669.12 --> 673.5600000000001
so despite losing that I kind of

671.779 --> 676.16
regained it

673.56 --> 676.16
without

678.14 --> 682.14
right anyway don't know if any of you

681.0 --> 685.519
care

682.14 --> 685.519
I'm just rambling

690.6 --> 693.9200000000001
yet kebabs

698.43 --> 701.5999999999999
[Music]

702.72 --> 708.86
did you make it yourself did you buy it

705.0 --> 708.86
in a kebab shop or something

713.64 --> 718.3199999999999
got an Illuminati concern and I really

715.68 --> 720.06
want to dig into it so

718.32 --> 722.279
slow chat

720.06 --> 724.76
well then I'm just gonna have lunch

722.279 --> 724.76
cheers

749.76 --> 755.48
awkward as heck out in the public

752.82 --> 755.48
hmm

756.32 --> 761.3000000000001
right well that sounds familiar Richard

758.76 --> 761.3
G but

762.42 --> 766.62
I don't actually feel like that

765.48 --> 770.7
well

766.62 --> 773.519
I might if I'm like in my pants that are

770.7 --> 776.339
so incredibly worn that does make me

773.519 --> 779.279
feel a bit awkward at times

776.339 --> 780.7790000000001
but in general like I have like a very

779.279 --> 785.7
strong

780.779 --> 788.899
attitude that I worked on to attain

785.7 --> 788.899
out in the public

789.36 --> 796.16
so that I'm always focusing it's like

792.48 --> 796.16
I'm basically representing

803.339 --> 808.74
like anybody's asks me anything or talks

806.279 --> 811.7
to me I will always be ready like and

808.74 --> 814.6800000000001
fully fully functional communicative

811.7 --> 817.98
it's just that

814.68 --> 821.16
if there's like new people that I don't

817.98 --> 823.44
recognize especially women

821.16 --> 826.3199999999999
and I feel like I wish I could like talk

823.44 --> 828.6
to them that's where I like have serious

826.32 --> 832.7
barriers and I'm like

828.6 --> 832.7
I don't know how to do this

834.3 --> 838.459
like that's when it gets awkward with me

839.94 --> 845.12
but my overall stance is not awkward

845.88 --> 849.2
and you can work on that

849.779 --> 851.899
um

859.74 --> 865.44
right random conversations

863.04 --> 868.98
well I'll just

865.44 --> 871.2
have random mini conversations about I

868.98 --> 874.1
don't know products in the grocery store

871.2 --> 874.1
the weather

876.54 --> 881.42
I mean there have absolutely no problem

878.7 --> 881.4200000000001
with that and

882.54 --> 890.279
everybody accepts it

885.66 --> 893.9399999999999
I mean I do rarely get like basically

890.279 --> 895.62
social signals that like you're we don't

893.94 --> 896.639
want to talk to you or anything I don't

895.62 --> 899.0600000000001
get that

896.639 --> 899.0600000000001
at least

903.18 --> 909.7399999999999
unless it's like

906.24 --> 912.24
in the air right that's like there's a

909.74 --> 914.76
temporary depletion where everybody's

912.24 --> 916.8
like really doesn't want to talk but

914.76 --> 918.899
then I'll feel that too and then just

916.8 --> 921.24
don't go

918.899 --> 923.94
but when the energy is there then it's

921.24 --> 926.399
like yeah I can respond

923.94 --> 927.6600000000001
I'm not always stuck in that depleted

926.399 --> 931.079
position

927.66 --> 933.12
and I I actually used to be that that at

931.079 --> 935.579
times but you could really correlate

933.12 --> 937.8
that kind of to depression

935.579 --> 939.7199999999999
your low energy and when everybody's low

937.8 --> 941.519
energy you feel kind of normal but then

939.72 --> 943.38
whenever but when the energy runs back

941.519 --> 944.4590000000001
up everybody's getting busy and you're

943.38 --> 947.519
just like

944.459 --> 949.68
[ __ ] I feel stuck

947.519 --> 951.54
like I can't ride that wave I used to

949.68 --> 953.8389999999999
have that a lot I don't really have that

951.54 --> 953.8389999999999
anymore

956.16 --> 962.279
which is very very pleasant

960.3 --> 964.56
very relieving

962.279 --> 966.06
because it's not pleasant to be stuck in

964.56 --> 968.04
in such it

966.06 --> 971.1199999999999
position where you basically can't even

968.04 --> 971.12
ride the up wave

972.959 --> 981.2399999999999
but I'm also just so much more aware now

976.92 --> 982.5
of like how things work with people with

981.24 --> 984.42
the energy

982.5 --> 986.88
like oh there's energy in there and then

984.42 --> 988.86
everybody responds they really will

986.88 --> 991.26
and I'm like

988.86 --> 993.36
the more time passes the more you get

991.26 --> 995.639
exposed to people the more you get to

993.36 --> 998.74
see how they respond to the different

995.639 --> 1001.929
types of energy that are in the air

998.74 --> 1001.929
[Music]

1004.279 --> 1009.8
and then you find out like

1007.699 --> 1012.139
how are they really

1009.8 --> 1013.88
like mechanically on the inside like how

1012.139 --> 1015.86
do they actually function and not just

1013.88 --> 1019.88
like what are their

1015.86 --> 1021.8000000000001
their modes like like a certain mode way

1019.88 --> 1024.26
of communicating like yeah you get to

1021.8 --> 1027.4389999999999
know that part but you also get to see

1024.26 --> 1029.78
like how they switch around

1027.439 --> 1032.059
when do they do what

1029.78 --> 1034.16
when do they get agitated when do they

1032.059 --> 1035.299
absolutely never get agitated like when

1034.16 --> 1038.1200000000001
are they like

1035.299 --> 1039.1399999999999
almost perfect and when are they kind of

1038.12 --> 1042.02
weaken

1039.14 --> 1044.8390000000002
like I paid like an enormous amount of

1042.02 --> 1047.66
attention to such things

1044.839 --> 1050.4189999999999
I'm very interested in people's

1047.66 --> 1053.14
weaknesses and strengths

1050.419 --> 1057.14
and not to [ __ ] them up

1053.14 --> 1059.96
but it's just really interesting to me

1057.14 --> 1062.0590000000002
because if I would ever get to know them

1059.96 --> 1063.44
in some situation or a conversation got

1062.059 --> 1065.539
brought up and people are like I'm

1063.44 --> 1067.76
trying to figure it out like I certainly

1065.539 --> 1071.6
have all these

1067.76 --> 1074.84
extra data that they're probably not

1071.6 --> 1077.12
considering that I can like graft into

1074.84 --> 1079.1599999999999
the conversation suddenly and give them

1077.12 --> 1080.6
all kinds of insights

1079.16 --> 1083.8600000000001
because of it

1080.6 --> 1083.86
and I just do that

1087.08 --> 1091.8799999999999
I mean I really do have a tendency to

1089.48 --> 1095.0
just break into a random conversation

1091.88 --> 1098.919
that other people are having

1095.0 --> 1102.08
if I feel I can like give some intrinsic

1098.919 --> 1103.94
relevant information

1102.08 --> 1106.48
even though I'm not actually part of the

1103.94 --> 1108.98
conversation I just do that

1106.48 --> 1111.32
and then hope that they're not like ah

1108.98 --> 1113.84
why are you stay out of it

1111.32 --> 1115.9399999999998
but I I don't get that a lot people do

1113.84 --> 1118.22
get like shocked a bit sometimes like

1115.94 --> 1119.539
what hey

1118.22 --> 1123.8600000000001
it's like oh you were in the

1119.539 --> 1126.28
conversation all along huh hmm

1123.86 --> 1126.28
anyway

1131.299 --> 1136.539
take some skills to do that

1133.7 --> 1136.539
yeah

1157.299 --> 1162.559
all right but anyway in conversations

1160.82 --> 1164.8999999999999
what I learned is really the most

1162.559 --> 1168.32
important thing to pay attention for is

1164.9 --> 1171.3200000000002
that I don't get overly comfortable

1168.32 --> 1174.32
because sometimes when I do that I I get

1171.32 --> 1177.58
into this really annoying habit of like

1174.32 --> 1177.58
correcting everything

1179.78 --> 1185.78
because when you give into that you

1181.76 --> 1188.9
could like get really and permanently on

1185.78 --> 1192.2
the nerves of certain types of people

1188.9 --> 1196.52
that to be really [ __ ] careful never

1192.2 --> 1199.039
to do that like never do that

1196.52 --> 1201.86
because if I slip into that like habit

1199.039 --> 1204.08
you could call it sort of autistic it

1201.86 --> 1206.36
can really rub people the wrong way so

1204.08 --> 1209.98
like I will still correct things but

1206.36 --> 1209.9799999999998
only when it's really irrelevant

1214.46 --> 1218.66
hmm anyway

1223.34 --> 1226.48
take another bite

1253.37 --> 1256.56
[Music]

1266.62 --> 1271.4189999999999
[Music]

1269.299 --> 1271.4189999999999
thank you

1294.62 --> 1297.4599999999998
oh yeah

1311.48 --> 1315.039
okay slow moment buggy

1324.57 --> 1327.78
[Music]

1333.26 --> 1337.58
don't mind being crazy yeah me too no

1335.539 --> 1339.559
I'm actually really happy to be

1337.58 --> 1342.86
corrected

1339.559 --> 1344.78
but nobody really does it

1342.86 --> 1347.299
it's like

1344.78 --> 1349.52
people size me up typically as somebody

1347.299 --> 1353.98
who would be like offended to be

1349.52 --> 1353.98
corrected but I'm really not

1354.38 --> 1360.14
I mean yeah I would have been if I

1356.419 --> 1362.96
hadn't like actively trained myself to

1360.14 --> 1365.44
actually do the opposite because it's so

1362.96 --> 1365.44
valuable

1365.6 --> 1370.8799999999999
and like even if somebody tries to

1367.58 --> 1373.039
correct me but they do it incorrectly

1370.88 --> 1374.48
and that happens too it's like they

1373.039 --> 1377.179
think they're correcting something but

1374.48 --> 1379.539
they got an yeah they got an incomplete

1377.179 --> 1379.539
picture

1379.88 --> 1385.46
well then I never take offense and just

1382.58 --> 1388.78
like try to explain to them like why it

1385.46 --> 1388.78
why they're incorrect

1389.96 --> 1394.3400000000001
and then still thank them

1392.24 --> 1397.0
like I always thank people for

1394.34 --> 1397.0
correcting me

1402.799 --> 1408.1589999999999
can you imagine a society where just

1405.919 --> 1410.96
everybody could just apply their inside

1408.159 --> 1413.1200000000001
intelligence and basically just correct

1410.96 --> 1415.58
out in the open and everybody would be

1413.12 --> 1419.08
like oh yeah thanks

1415.58 --> 1419.08
wouldn't that be amazing

1427.659 --> 1433.1200000000001
well the only way to create it is to do

1430.7 --> 1433.1200000000001
it yourself

1437.179 --> 1439.419
foreign

1441.34 --> 1448.299
amount of people out there do not seem

1444.38 --> 1448.2990000000002
to be very fond of being corrected

1453.62 --> 1456.62
squeaking

1467.56 --> 1472.039
[Music]

1469.28 --> 1474.86
opinion based yeah that's annoying yeah

1472.039 --> 1478.28
now that opinions are just

1474.86 --> 1479.78
or like speculation based stuff no this

1478.28 --> 1482.6
would happen

1479.78 --> 1484.46
but I mean that's different

1482.6 --> 1487.0
that's different as like technical

1484.46 --> 1487.0
correction

1489.07 --> 1494.24
[Music]

1492.2 --> 1496.76
I need plenty of people like do that

1494.24 --> 1499.1200000000001
they just have their certain view on

1496.76 --> 1499.12
things

1499.159 --> 1502.94
usually a bit underdeveloped and they

1501.26 --> 1505.22
try to share that

1502.94 --> 1507.8200000000002
that's not the same as like trying to

1505.22 --> 1507.82
correct people

1508.73 --> 1511.839
[Music]

1528.1 --> 1531.25
[Music]

1548.07 --> 1555.339
[Music]

1564.2 --> 1571.039
all right I also realized a lot

1568.22 --> 1575.299
that I'm just so happy

1571.039 --> 1577.64
that I'm like on the right path morally

1575.299 --> 1579.559
like I really do that I have been doing

1577.64 --> 1580.8200000000002
my best because

1579.559 --> 1584.74
guys

1580.82 --> 1584.74
when I'm like demoralized

1586.94 --> 1592.76
I can be like an atrocious person and I

1591.02 --> 1596.36
mean really

1592.76 --> 1599.72
I would like ooze

1596.36 --> 1603.32
like an aura of just like misery and

1599.72 --> 1606.14
patheticness and it's unbelievable

1603.32 --> 1608.12
and it's kind of unfair like it has been

1606.14 --> 1609.38
like unfair to me it feels like it

1608.12 --> 1611.539
because

1609.38 --> 1613.159
when I'm like highly demoralized I just

1611.539 --> 1615.32
like okay I'm crumbling I'm just gonna

1613.159 --> 1616.8200000000002
try to keep going then

1615.32 --> 1620.0
set it out

1616.82 --> 1621.559
but like everything is [ __ ] not because

1620.0 --> 1624.919
it feels like it but like people

1621.559 --> 1627.62
suddenly respond shitty to me

1624.919 --> 1631.3400000000001
like all the time

1627.62 --> 1635.1999999999998
that's been like a huge

1631.34 --> 1635.1999999999998
[ __ ] with my mind

1639.14 --> 1643.159
like when I feel weak or whatever or

1641.299 --> 1645.26
broken there's certainly all kinds of

1643.159 --> 1647.8400000000001
people that are just like gonna try to

1645.26 --> 1650.84
suddenly get in your head or like get

1647.84 --> 1655.299
you under their shoulder

1650.84 --> 1655.299
and I find that extremely unpleasant

1655.64 --> 1660.6200000000001
and it really makes me feel like it's

1658.22 --> 1662.6000000000001
actually just a jungle it's like as soon

1660.62 --> 1664.9399999999998
as you weaken like immediately the

1662.6 --> 1667.8999999999999
parasites just jump on you and just try

1664.94 --> 1667.9
to suck your eye

1668.48 --> 1672.08
right

1669.86 --> 1675.4599999999998
but anyway I'm not in that position I'm

1672.08 --> 1675.46
just really glad that

1675.98 --> 1681.5
I'm not demoralized and then that have

1678.98 --> 1683.799
done so much my best to basically ensure

1681.5 --> 1683.799
that

1686.299 --> 1689.5
hey Mark colored

1700.31 --> 1703.75
[Music]

1705.74 --> 1712.7
most open person here

1709.4 --> 1715.6000000000001
you are colored

1712.7 --> 1715.6000000000001
no thanks

1715.66 --> 1724.059
[Music]

1718.9 --> 1724.0590000000002
I get it I get it I'm joking

1726.2 --> 1729.64
I appreciate that

1735.02 --> 1740.08
to me it's just kind of the only way to

1737.6 --> 1740.08
to go

1742.22 --> 1747.32
like it just works best for me I'm like

1744.74 --> 1750.44
an open computer guy I'm like why can't

1747.32 --> 1752.539
we just all function properly and like

1750.44 --> 1755.9
help each other out and just

1752.539 --> 1758.86
be super honest and and dare to be

1755.9 --> 1758.8600000000001
vulnerable because

1761.539 --> 1765.039
yeah

1762.86 --> 1768.9189999999999
don't look at the world as a giant

1765.039 --> 1770.96
Predator trying to get you

1768.919 --> 1774.3200000000002
like the evil trying to consume just

1770.96 --> 1778.52
look at it as no it's all a computer and

1774.32 --> 1781.399
the computer sometimes gets caught up

1778.52 --> 1783.679
with bugs that are very distracting and

1781.399 --> 1786.559
basically ice yeah prevent certain

1783.679 --> 1789.799
functions from working properly

1786.559 --> 1791.899
but if everything braces against it it

1789.799 --> 1793.8799999999999
only makes it worse

1791.899 --> 1796.2199999999998
so that's it's all a matter of

1793.88 --> 1798.44
perspective and I've really done my best

1796.22 --> 1800.96
to like attain that right perspective

1798.44 --> 1802.52
and just see like no I'm I am a car

1800.96 --> 1805.88
getting a machine

1802.52 --> 1807.98
the machine has problems though a lot of

1805.88 --> 1811.279
problems and it's been pretty severe and

1807.98 --> 1814.48
I even only realized that the depth of

1811.279 --> 1814.48
the problems very late

1817.279 --> 1823.179
but just because of all those

1819.559 --> 1823.1789999999999
circumstances I can't just

1823.64 --> 1827.8990000000001
imagine

1825.08 --> 1830.72
think that like oh well it's

1827.899 --> 1832.34
overwhelming I just won me well then I

1830.72 --> 1834.8600000000001
can't do anything

1832.34 --> 1837.6789999999999
I won't be able to change it and then

1834.86 --> 1839.899
you give up and then you probably will

1837.679 --> 1841.88
slip into fear and all that because it

1839.899 --> 1843.5
is like fear

1841.88 --> 1846.7990000000002
that would drive you to such a

1843.5 --> 1849.02
conclusion instead I literally

1846.799 --> 1851.299
think of it differently and I just see

1849.02 --> 1852.44
myself like I'm just gonna Shine the

1851.299 --> 1854.6589999999999
right light

1852.44 --> 1857.74
just one person

1854.659 --> 1861.0200000000002
and then theoretically

1857.74 --> 1863.84
99.9 percent of people will never even

1861.02 --> 1865.279
see that or feel that or be able to

1863.84 --> 1868.1
resonate with it

1865.279 --> 1869.72
but still it's going to like on the

1868.1 --> 1871.6999999999998
other dimension kind of thing it's like

1869.72 --> 1873.8600000000001
it's still going to

1871.7 --> 1876.74
just as one part of the entire human

1873.86 --> 1879.62
it's I'm going to make it the frequency

1876.74 --> 1881.72
resonant I'm going to make it

1879.62 --> 1885.3799999999999
echo on

1881.72 --> 1887.779
because I'm touching the water like

1885.38 --> 1889.5200000000002
creating a ripple in a very special way

1887.779 --> 1893.38
that people

1889.52 --> 1893.3799999999999
don't go that far

1896.0 --> 1902.72
but I do is like I I'm seriously in the

1899.72 --> 1906.32
belief convinced that I can change the

1902.72 --> 1907.82
frequency of all of mankind slowly and

1906.32 --> 1909.86
gradually

1907.82 --> 1912.1589999999999
by giving the right example and they

1909.86 --> 1916.2199999999998
technically don't even have to

1912.159 --> 1917.659
consciously perceive me for that to work

1916.22 --> 1919.7
yeah

1917.659 --> 1923.679
you could say oh that's magical thinking

1919.7 --> 1923.679
yeah it's also experience

1927.799 --> 1933.74
and it is partially based on lessons

1931.039 --> 1936.74
sort of esoteric spiritual lessons that

1933.74 --> 1940.7
I got from my parents it's like you just

1936.74 --> 1943.1
have to imagine it you just have to

1940.7 --> 1945.5
and visualize

1943.1 --> 1949.4189999999999
what you want it to be how you want it

1945.5 --> 1949.419
to be and be reasonable about it

1951.32 --> 1955.96
find the reasonable vision

1956.659 --> 1963.679
and then carry it out literally like do

1960.559 --> 1967.46
it but also carry it

1963.679 --> 1969.14
out to others so they are like hey

1967.46 --> 1970.3990000000001
that's a good thing

1969.14 --> 1975.2
I'll

1970.399 --> 1976.9399999999998
sample or assimilate some of that

1975.2 --> 1979.7
and then

1976.94 --> 1981.559
it spreads

1979.7 --> 1983.059
and then it certainly it becomes normal

1981.559 --> 1984.6789999999999
and everybody just does that

1983.059 --> 1987.32
automatically

1984.679 --> 1989.24
right so that's kind of like part of the

1987.32 --> 1991.9399999999998
vision

1989.24 --> 1995.84
and I mean yeah an actual

1991.94 --> 1999.5800000000002
uh visualization Vision not not that

1995.84 --> 1999.58
hallucinatory based experience

2009.66 --> 2013.6090000000002
[Music]

2019.72 --> 2022.72
right

2024.279 --> 2031.799
yeah it's a classic one

2026.86 --> 2031.799
Real Eyes Realize Real Lies yeah

2077.139 --> 2083.099
right

2079.659 --> 2083.099
so in conclusion

2083.379 --> 2089.919
it seems like I'm doing exactly

2087.399 --> 2091.839
what I trained to do

2089.919 --> 2093.7599999999998
what I wanted to do and what I'm

2091.839 --> 2096.879
supposed to do

2093.76 --> 2099.28
even though when you look

2096.879 --> 2100.839
at a bigger picture it's like yeah or

2099.28 --> 2103.599
when you're not financially really

2100.839 --> 2106.599
getting anywhere and

2103.599 --> 2108.88
and you seem to have this really hermit

2106.599 --> 2111.2200000000003
type life that you might experience as

2108.88 --> 2115.42
being stuck

2111.22 --> 2119.859
but at the same time I'm doing exactly

2115.42 --> 2121.9
what I had and visualized to do

2119.859 --> 2123.8199999999997
as a teenager it's like one of those

2121.9 --> 2125.7400000000002
things that I actually envisualize

2123.82 --> 2129.9
successfully

2125.74 --> 2129.8999999999996
although I I didn't really

2131.26 --> 2137.5600000000004
go for that immediately because

2134.079 --> 2139.6600000000003
I just got like this yeah the material

2137.56 --> 2142.599
issues it's like yeah I don't want to be

2139.66 --> 2144.22
poor I need stuff I need to be able to

2142.599 --> 2145.839
get stuff

2144.22 --> 2148.6189999999997
I need monies I need to make money

2145.839 --> 2148.619
somehow and

2150.46 --> 2155.619
didn't work out super great

2153.52 --> 2158.8
but now

2155.619 --> 2162.119
decades later I'm I feel like this is

2158.8 --> 2165.7000000000003
what I was supposed to be doing

2162.119 --> 2169.42
I just hope that

2165.7 --> 2172.4199999999996
it's not actually gonna be exclusively

2169.42 --> 2175.2400000000002
poverty I mean I think I've sat through

2172.42 --> 2178.38
the test of poverty and shown that I can

2175.24 --> 2178.3799999999997
deal with it

2181.3 --> 2186.099
that doesn't mean I want to just

2183.64 --> 2188.4
continually be in that position forever

2186.099 --> 2188.4
though

2189.74 --> 2196.109
[Music]

2200.38 --> 2206.339
because in ways I do actually miss doing

2203.859 --> 2206.339
stuff

2212.14 --> 2216.96
because I also found plenty of

2217.2 --> 2225.1189999999997
energizing little challenges in doing

2221.5 --> 2225.119
stuff out there

2226.48 --> 2233.16
and I've kind of like given up on that

2228.94 --> 2233.16
for a more Simple Life

2233.32 --> 2237.579
where I'm just focusing on just get

2235.599 --> 2240.4
being able to get around and just be

2237.579 --> 2243.3390000000004
okay with it like be okay like yeah it's

2240.4 --> 2246.52
much less like you have no idea how much

2243.339 --> 2249.7
I miss having a car like I miss it a lot

2246.52 --> 2254.02
like a real damn lot

2249.7 --> 2257.3799999999997
I really [ __ ] miss it a lot

2254.02 --> 2260.32
but I can't just work myself up over

2257.38 --> 2263.94
that all the time I can't afford that

2260.32 --> 2263.94
because it's bad for my health

2271.96 --> 2275.76
money is at least with your concerns

2273.52 --> 2275.7599999999998
okay

2327.82 --> 2331.599
Family Health maybe it's concerned yes

2330.28 --> 2334.5400000000004
more color

2331.599 --> 2338.02
yeah of course

2334.54 --> 2341.04
well me personally I don't really have

2338.02 --> 2341.04
that issue as much

2349.119 --> 2354.099
I mean

2350.619 --> 2356.619
I think my family did like what remains

2354.099 --> 2359.1400000000003
of my family out there

2356.619 --> 2361.359
like my aunt and my nephew my brother

2359.14 --> 2363.7599999999998
and his family

2361.359 --> 2365.0789999999997
I think they're doing just fine

2363.76 --> 2367.119
I mean

2365.079 --> 2369.52
but I don't know because they don't

2367.119 --> 2373.859
really have I don't really have contact

2369.52 --> 2373.859
with them like for years so

2373.96 --> 2378.28
I don't know if they're trying to avoid

2376.359 --> 2381.839
me if they know I'm in Flat Earth and

2378.28 --> 2381.8390000000004
they're trying to I have no idea

2394.44 --> 2398.16
ALG good to see you

2407.52 --> 2412.2599999999998
[Music]

2409.359 --> 2412.2599999999998
cheers

2418.78 --> 2423.94
wow

2421.54 --> 2426.119
by the way there is caffeine in this

2423.94 --> 2426.119
thing

2432.22 --> 2435.4199999999996
it's weird because

2436.24 --> 2441.7
of drinking coffee and tea had like a

2439.3 --> 2443.7400000000002
response to that

2441.7 --> 2445.4199999999996
I don't seem to have that kind of

2443.74 --> 2448.4199999999996
response to this but maybe it's also

2445.42 --> 2451.42
because I just drink one

2448.42 --> 2453.7200000000003
and tea I would drink like throughout in

2451.42 --> 2453.7200000000003
the evening

2459.09 --> 2464.26
[Music]

2461.579 --> 2467.099
yeah but I'm really liking these Gusto

2464.26 --> 2467.099
energy drinks

2472.619 --> 2478.42
right by the way there's probably a lot

2475.359 --> 2483.339
of friction happening out there

2478.42 --> 2485.26
it seems like there's a war Brewing

2483.339 --> 2489.22
again

2485.26 --> 2492.099
Flat Earth debates versus

2489.22 --> 2494.64
all the other [ __ ] out there several

2492.099 --> 2494.6400000000003
camps

2496.119 --> 2503.2000000000003
I had this whole shitty back and forth

2501.04 --> 2505.3
with refracted curvature John yesterday

2503.2 --> 2509.3999999999996
like he was having a conversation with D

2505.3 --> 2509.4
Rose and Master P

2509.44 --> 2514.66
and it just ran on and on I created a

2512.44 --> 2518.02
separate

2514.66 --> 2520.54
chat for it that I joined

2518.02 --> 2523.06
and then basically lay down like my

2520.54 --> 2524.98
position like how I am towards like the

2523.06 --> 2529.2999999999997
upward moving Earth

2524.98 --> 2531.88
and basically my position is like yeah

2529.3 --> 2535.1400000000003
it's absolutely possible

2531.88 --> 2539.2200000000003
and it works out mechanically it's also

2535.14 --> 2542.56
absolutely and permanently unprovable

2539.22 --> 2545.02
and therefore it's always going to be a

2542.56 --> 2547.359
affirming the consequent pharmacological

2545.02 --> 2550.72
fallacy

2547.359 --> 2554.46
or as I like to oversimplified a

2550.72 --> 2554.4599999999996
presupposition based concept

2556.18 --> 2563.9199999999996
but John is like

2558.72 --> 2566.2
complete he went ape [ __ ] he literally

2563.92 --> 2568.96
turned like like foaming at the mouth

2566.2 --> 2571.2999999999997
and like trying to entrap me in false

2568.96 --> 2573.7
dichotomy and I'm like what the [ __ ] is

2571.3 --> 2575.8
your problem I already said like it's

2573.7 --> 2578.68
not provable

2575.8 --> 2580.96
and it's not my claim and he would just

2578.68 --> 2581.6
act like I was like what the hell is

2580.96 --> 2583.54
wrong with him

2581.6 --> 2587.859
[Music]

2583.54 --> 2590.8
like he went insane over that like what

2587.859 --> 2593.859
the [ __ ] is wrong with you I mean it's

2590.8 --> 2595.7200000000003
just a concept

2593.859 --> 2599.02
it's like are you gonna go foaming at

2595.72 --> 2601.5989999999997
the mouth over theory of relativity are

2599.02 --> 2605.02
you going to go fully come onto your uh

2601.599 --> 2607.48
like no well why the hell would you do

2605.02 --> 2609.819
with upward Rising Earth

2607.48 --> 2613.68
it's the same level

2609.819 --> 2613.68
I was really kind of shocked about that

2616.48 --> 2619.68
so yeah

2620.38 --> 2624.78
oh there's just this Ruckus going and

2624.88 --> 2629.4
I think it's going to be a bloody

2630.16 --> 2634.56
flatter Civil War [ __ ]

2636.94 --> 2641.68
I mean that used to happen or like years

2639.4 --> 2645.6600000000003
ago too

2641.68 --> 2645.66
when Bob nodel was still there

2649.66 --> 2656.68
and now like wits it and Dell have like

2653.92 --> 2660.4
they've declared war pretty much

2656.68 --> 2662.02
well you could also say that

2660.4 --> 2664.839
like

2662.02 --> 2666.4
QE and Nathan have declared war and they

2664.839 --> 2669.64
are now like

2666.4 --> 2672.64
like locked in into that I don't know I

2669.64 --> 2675.52
don't really know how to see it

2672.64 --> 2677.6189999999997
but it is like kind of a bit bizarre

2675.52 --> 2679.359
that there's just groups of flat

2677.619 --> 2682.0
earthers out there that are being super

2679.359 --> 2684.339
popular and going around

2682.0 --> 2686.76
that are like they should be very

2684.339 --> 2689.98
conscious that they're

2686.76 --> 2692.0200000000004
inserting conceptions that can never be

2689.98 --> 2695.319
proven like

2692.02 --> 2698.7599999999998
they're almost like bragging about it

2695.319 --> 2701.319
like they feel proud as a magician

2698.76 --> 2703.8
and it's like what the [ __ ] are these

2701.319 --> 2703.8
people doing

2705.3 --> 2712.1800000000003
it's like creating a new [ __ ]

2709.119 --> 2713.92
ball for people like within Flat Earth

2712.18 --> 2716.16
like you're you're doing the same thing

2713.92 --> 2716.16
again

2717.88 --> 2723.88
and it makes the people

2721.42 --> 2728.7000000000003
especially the ones that follow it

2723.88 --> 2732.7000000000003
it makes them like palpably

2728.7 --> 2735.46
perceivably degenerated like people

2732.7 --> 2737.56
become [ __ ] stupid because of what

2735.46 --> 2740.26
they do like

2737.56 --> 2742.619
because of the the technobabble nonsense

2740.26 --> 2746.0200000000004
and The Ether and

2742.619 --> 2749.2000000000003
reifying it's really bizarre to see that

2746.02 --> 2752.2599999999998
people that are on to that they turn

2749.2 --> 2754.24
[ __ ] they really do that

2752.26 --> 2759.2200000000003
it's not just like oh they get it wrong

2754.24 --> 2762.22
no their behavior like the social

2759.22 --> 2767.2799999999997
component to their behavior becomes like

2762.22 --> 2767.2799999999997
really stupid and absurd and

2768.16 --> 2771.5789999999997
it's

2768.86 --> 2773.76
[Music]

2771.579 --> 2773.76
foreign

2775.14 --> 2780.46
just makes me feel and I'm not the only

2778.24 --> 2781.18
one an fpd everybody feels that by the

2780.46 --> 2783.04
way

2781.18 --> 2786.0989999999997
that that's happening to people out

2783.04 --> 2789.7
there flat earthers that follow that

2786.099 --> 2792.339
it's like why is everybody choosing to

2789.7 --> 2795.0989999999997
be [ __ ] because it's a choice and

2792.339 --> 2797.56
it's probably a choice in which to a

2795.099 --> 2801.579
certain degree peer pressure is involved

2797.56 --> 2803.74
consciously or not consciously

2801.579 --> 2806.319
could be like oh you're just there you

2803.74 --> 2808.7799999999997
just do it and you're gonna go

2806.319 --> 2812.22
find a place in relation to how you feel

2808.78 --> 2812.2200000000003
the pressures that are there

2813.46 --> 2820.06
not subconsciously or you're like oh

2816.099 --> 2821.8590000000004
well the big group thing is on this I

2820.06 --> 2823.72
don't want to be the little guy because

2821.859 --> 2825.2799999999997
they don't have a lot of people that

2823.72 --> 2828.4199999999996
will be against me and that's a

2825.28 --> 2828.42
conscious decision right

2830.2 --> 2833.339
but

2831.88 --> 2836.7400000000002
siding

2833.339 --> 2839.68
with broken reasoning in the face of

2836.74 --> 2842.2
everything we learned like oh where we

2839.68 --> 2844.1189999999997
came from how Flat Earth debate has

2842.2 --> 2846.7
worked so hard on breaking down

2844.119 --> 2848.7400000000002
fallacies of the globe model

2846.7 --> 2851.9399999999996
and religion

2848.74 --> 2851.9399999999996
and then to just

2852.819 --> 2859.359
take a step back from take the bar down

2856.54 --> 2862.9
to basically start doing similar things

2859.359 --> 2866.02
with the Flat Earth I mean it's it makes

2862.9 --> 2868.78
people dumb remember how the Globe made

2866.02 --> 2871.359
people really dumb

2868.78 --> 2874.2400000000002
well it's happening again and now it's

2871.359 --> 2876.46
happening within flattered circles

2874.24 --> 2879.22
because of a bunch of people that have

2876.46 --> 2880.96
set their sights on we're gonna make up

2879.22 --> 2883.18
our [ __ ] and it's gonna be our

2880.96 --> 2885.88
[ __ ] like there's some kind of

2883.18 --> 2887.859
Catholic church or something like not

2885.88 --> 2889.9
saying that all Catholics are

2887.859 --> 2893.56
always wrong or whatever there's

2889.9 --> 2896.079
interesting things in there too but

2893.56 --> 2898.2599999999998
they are making up things up as they go

2896.079 --> 2898.26
along

2899.7 --> 2905.22
and then think that's what you're

2901.72 --> 2905.22
supposed to do when it isn't

2906.099 --> 2911.6800000000003
it's lowering the bar again making it

2909.22 --> 2914.02
more widely accessible to more people

2911.68 --> 2916.48
because it's easier

2914.02 --> 2920.319
but thereby you lose the cohesion and

2916.48 --> 2923.92
everybody's just as fragile to magician

2920.319 --> 2926.859
trickery including from the outside as

2923.92 --> 2929.52
they were as a baller and isn't that the

2926.859 --> 2929.52
entire problem

2929.98 --> 2934.66
people that are delusional or believe in

2932.859 --> 2935.68
delusional things and think that that's

2934.66 --> 2939.8799999999997
logical

2935.68 --> 2943.54
are very vulnerable to manipulation

2939.88 --> 2946.54
especially manipulation from evil

2943.54 --> 2948.94
from people that are eugenicists that

2946.54 --> 2950.87
want to euthanize because you're

2948.94 --> 2954.239
delusional

2950.87 --> 2954.239
[Music]

2956.319 --> 2962.68
so by overall having people side with

2960.099 --> 2966.0
degraded positions within a community

2962.68 --> 2968.68
that strives to

2966.0 --> 2970.96
uphold and bring forth

2968.68 --> 2973.48
certain important information like how

2970.96 --> 2974.56
the Earth is flat and not actually a

2973.48 --> 2977.7400000000002
ball

2974.56 --> 2982.14
like the mainstream claims well if those

2977.74 --> 2984.339
all dilapidate because of poor choices

2982.14 --> 2987.94
in their maneuvering or social

2984.339 --> 2992.619
maneuvering you'll become more of a

2987.94 --> 2995.92
Target yeah it's like percentile wise

2992.619 --> 2998.859
the worse the delusion levels become in

2995.92 --> 3001.14
the entire Community the lower we grow

2998.859 --> 3003.72
and eventually they'll be like ah

3001.14 --> 3005.24
they're ready they're ready for the

3003.72 --> 3008.04
slaughter yeah

3005.24 --> 3009.839
percentage of the illusion is high

3008.04 --> 3010.92
enough now they're ready for the

3009.839 --> 3013.68
slaughter and then they're going to

3010.92 --> 3018.2400000000002
really [ __ ] you up yeah because that's

3013.68 --> 3021.3799999999997
how this [ __ ] world works you see

3018.24 --> 3021.3799999999997
it's how it works

3021.66 --> 3026.5789999999997
yeah if people are really strong and

3023.94 --> 3029.64
sharp you don't just [ __ ] attack them

3026.579 --> 3031.8
unless you can literally literally like

3029.64 --> 3033.72
annihilate them in one moment or

3031.8 --> 3036.78
something like blow them up or mass

3033.72 --> 3040.02
arrest right but that leaves like a big

3036.78 --> 3042.9
question marks and it can only happen in

3040.02 --> 3046.74
in chaotic moments when there is like

3042.9 --> 3049.02
heavy War everywhere not just one region

3046.74 --> 3051.18
and it's tents that's not the same but

3049.02 --> 3052.8
there's like big [ __ ] and chaos and then

3051.18 --> 3054.48
you can do those kinds of things very

3052.8 --> 3056.099
easily

3054.48 --> 3058.339
right but that's not happening now

3056.099 --> 3062.119
luckily

3058.339 --> 3062.119
it's getting there though

3062.22 --> 3065.5789999999997
we're probably not going to be able to

3063.839 --> 3067.0789999999997
hold that off forever I mean it's

3065.579 --> 3068.88
getting worse out there and it's getting

3067.079 --> 3071.7000000000003
more chaotic and it

3068.88 --> 3074.94
New World Order and they're crazy

3071.7 --> 3077.2799999999997
Marxist puppets in power

3074.94 --> 3078.78
that are trying to unlock the gates of

3077.28 --> 3080.94
hell

3078.78 --> 3083.8190000000004
well they are going and it's not going

3080.94 --> 3087.66
to grow any less worse

3083.819 --> 3091.46
unless there's going to be switch moment

3087.66 --> 3091.46
unless there's enough pushback

3093.059 --> 3098.059
and that might happen anyway this I'm

3095.46 --> 3098.059
getting off track

3099.78 --> 3106.0400000000004
part of the reason like why fed gets so

3102.72 --> 3109.2599999999998
hard on other groups and deviant

3106.04 --> 3111.18
opinions that are illogical

3109.26 --> 3114.6600000000003
that are fallacious

3111.18 --> 3117.1189999999997
is because of our realization of this

3114.66 --> 3119.16
vulnerability as a group

3117.119 --> 3120.119
like when we when you're strong and

3119.16 --> 3122.94
sharp

3120.119 --> 3126.359
you're like a a Spartan

3122.94 --> 3131.64
Prime military unit right like the movie

3126.359 --> 3133.619
300 like yeah in general like a squad or

3131.64 --> 3135.96
whatever is not just gonna attack that

3133.619 --> 3137.94
because like they're really sharp

3135.96 --> 3140.04
they're really notorious they're all

3137.94 --> 3141.92
beefed up and they're super strong and

3140.04 --> 3146.4
experienced it's like

3141.92 --> 3149.4
yeah that's scary right but if they were

3146.4 --> 3152.099
all malnutritioned and like

3149.4 --> 3155.52
sore or under

3152.099 --> 3158.94
like dehydrated or something well then

3155.52 --> 3160.619
it's like oh well we could try it now

3158.94 --> 3165.3
that they're a little weekend right well

3160.619 --> 3167.6400000000003
that's how I but Nathan too and the rest

3165.3 --> 3169.619
of fed pretty sure they most of them

3167.64 --> 3172.02
think of it like it's like if the Flat

3169.619 --> 3175.099
Earth Community is weakened

3172.02 --> 3178.2599999999998
with delusion and and fallacies

3175.099 --> 3180.3
then we could become a more serious

3178.26 --> 3182.4
Target other than just trying to shove

3180.3 --> 3184.079
us under the carpet and ridicule us

3182.4 --> 3186.42
among their own

3184.079 --> 3189.319
right

3186.42 --> 3189.319
and I yeah

3189.72 --> 3196.16
you can't just let it Fester you can't

3192.839 --> 3196.16
let the delusion faster

3199.559 --> 3202.94
you gotta point it out

3207.48 --> 3211.68
but also we gotta somehow as fed

3210.24 --> 3214.2599999999998
specific

3211.68 --> 3217.44
deal with all these people that seem to

3214.26 --> 3220.44
be hyper envious

3217.44 --> 3223.44
that are like attacking fed

3220.44 --> 3225.059
because we humiliate them because of

3223.44 --> 3226.92
their fallacies

3225.059 --> 3228.1800000000003
and their inconsistencies in their

3226.92 --> 3231.119
double speak

3228.18 --> 3232.5589999999997
and now they just hate us because we

3231.119 --> 3235.6400000000003
pointed out

3232.559 --> 3235.6400000000003
how they're broken

3237.33 --> 3241.619
[Music]

3239.4 --> 3243.54
and there's so many of these people that

3241.619 --> 3245.46
are kind of broken that are kind of

3243.54 --> 3248.64
[ __ ] up that are just like yeah I'm

3245.46 --> 3250.92
saying really [ __ ] up things

3248.64 --> 3253.68
that aren't just like oh yeah you got

3250.92 --> 3257.0
too angry right no no that just really

3253.68 --> 3257.0
[ __ ] up errors

3257.099 --> 3262.319
which there's no like you can't give an

3260.22 --> 3265.5589999999997
emotional excuse for that or whatever

3262.319 --> 3268.859
it's just really [ __ ] wrong

3265.559 --> 3270.599
and technically broken and all that and

3268.859 --> 3274.16
inconsistent

3270.599 --> 3274.1600000000003
not well researched

3278.46 --> 3281.96
and that's just problematic

3286.64 --> 3291.42
[Music]

3288.66 --> 3295.14
you have to stop doing that you have to

3291.42 --> 3298.26
stop it you can't just go bullshitting

3295.14 --> 3301.44
like I've had to stop that yeah

3298.26 --> 3304.26
I have a giant mechanism

3301.44 --> 3306.42
that I utilize now as I try to explain

3304.26 --> 3309.5400000000004
conceptions

3306.42 --> 3312.54
that have to use default I have to do

3309.54 --> 3315.3
that default every [ __ ] time

3312.54 --> 3318.18
to basically set the premise straight as

3315.3 --> 3321.119
in like I'm going to describe something

3318.18 --> 3325.68
that is a concept and that I do not

3321.119 --> 3329.119
claim as a definitive reality but that I

3325.68 --> 3332.04
might have a percentile a percentage of

3329.119 --> 3334.079
investment on like I I really think like

3332.04 --> 3335.7599999999998
for example I really think there is a

3334.079 --> 3338.7200000000003
looping element to the realm I really

3335.76 --> 3338.7200000000003
think that's the case

3339.0 --> 3344.88
also I really think that Celestial

3342.42 --> 3348.2400000000002
lights are purely holographic

3344.88 --> 3350.2200000000003
and yeah I know I I have no idea how to

3348.24 --> 3353.3999999999996
prove it other than to point at the lack

3350.22 --> 3354.8999999999996
of physical evidence like proximity data

3353.4 --> 3356.46
all that

3354.9 --> 3359.04
right

3356.46 --> 3361.2
so I have to point that out every

3359.04 --> 3363.92
[ __ ] time but it's like it's a bit

3361.2 --> 3368.5789999999997
tedious but it also makes what I do

3363.92 --> 3371.099
extremely correct and very clear and

3368.579 --> 3372.0
other people that get into thinking like

3371.099 --> 3376.4
that

3372.0 --> 3376.4
well they can use that clarity

3376.859 --> 3382.02
to think clearly about it

3380.099 --> 3384.599
so maybe

3382.02 --> 3388.319
attempt to reconstruct some of those

3384.599 --> 3390.7200000000003
processes for their own ideas to be very

3388.319 --> 3393.119
careful

3390.72 --> 3395.04
it's like yeah I'm not like literally

3393.119 --> 3397.1400000000003
making a claim or I'm not saying this is

3395.04 --> 3399.7799999999997
science

3397.14 --> 3401.819
I'm just thinking about mathematical

3399.78 --> 3404.3590000000004
based mechanics

3401.819 --> 3407.099
or practical

3404.359 --> 3408.839
experience based mechanics right

3407.099 --> 3411.96
different angles of approach you can

3408.839 --> 3415.02
work on as long as you preface what you

3411.96 --> 3418.14
are doing very carefully and you don't

3415.02 --> 3421.14
like forget about doing that like you

3418.14 --> 3424.02
hold on to that preface you don't overt

3421.14 --> 3426.5989999999997
you don't overtly get obsessed with the

3424.02 --> 3429.18
concept so that you first preface it and

3426.599 --> 3430.38
then you're like it's absolutely

3429.18 --> 3433.2599999999998
right

3430.38 --> 3435.48
let's all another Pitfall that just too

3433.26 --> 3438.6600000000003
many people out there that get into Flat

3435.48 --> 3442.16
Earth they fall for that [ __ ]

3438.66 --> 3442.16
they fall in that trap

3442.2 --> 3445.339
taking out a whack

3446.099 --> 3451.1400000000003
and it all makes us weak it makes us all

3450.119 --> 3453.9
weak

3451.14 --> 3456.48
the average person displays that kind of

3453.9 --> 3460.319
error then that

3456.48 --> 3463.319
is what everybody that gazes up on Flat

3460.319 --> 3465.0
Earth positively or negatively starts to

3463.319 --> 3467.22
associate with us and then it will

3465.0 --> 3471.3
become like a perceived palpable

3467.22 --> 3473.9399999999996
weakness that will eventually add up

3471.3 --> 3475.619
in a judgment scenario where there will

3473.94 --> 3478.859
be determined whether we're going to

3475.619 --> 3481.319
become a more serious Target or not

3478.859 --> 3483.56
because that does happen periodically

3481.319 --> 3486.73
everywhere in the world

3483.56 --> 3486.73
[Music]

3487.98 --> 3494.9
so we need to stop

3490.22 --> 3494.8999999999996
dilapidating our Behavior

3495.78 --> 3499.559
and

3497.46 --> 3503.04
our code of conduct within the

3499.559 --> 3504.48
conceptualization an explanation of

3503.04 --> 3506.7599999999998
these things

3504.48 --> 3508.68
we need to clear it up we need to do it

3506.76 --> 3511.8590000000004
better I keep working on it but

3508.68 --> 3514.02
everybody else needs to do that too

3511.859 --> 3517.2
because if you don't

3514.02 --> 3518.7
you might end up becoming a collective

3517.2 --> 3523.0989999999997
Target

3518.7 --> 3523.0989999999997
and we are are already targeted

3523.92 --> 3528.02
but it can always become worse

3529.5 --> 3534.059
or can you imagine that just some of

3531.9 --> 3536.04
these asses just become worse and worse

3534.059 --> 3539.28
and they really start to like publicly

3536.04 --> 3541.68
misbehave and [ __ ] well guess what is

3539.28 --> 3543.96
going to be used as an example for

3541.68 --> 3548.04
flutters then

3543.96 --> 3550.319
right you know that's gonna happen

3548.04 --> 3552.42
it will use that

3550.319 --> 3554.88
and I mean undoubtedly in the future

3552.42 --> 3557.46
when that comes they'll dig into my

3554.88 --> 3559.98
archive and take all my kill them all

3557.46 --> 3561.599
footage as an example of how flat

3559.98 --> 3564.059
earthers are completely insane because

3561.599 --> 3566.099
they can of course they will

3564.059 --> 3567.599
tensions are high they can get away with

3566.099 --> 3571.26
that [ __ ]

3567.599 --> 3574.8590000000004
everybody think I'm just a crazy maniac

3571.26 --> 3577.0200000000004
because yeah if you some concentrate

3574.859 --> 3578.94
those moments together in a video yeah

3577.02 --> 3580.859
it'll make me look like a complete

3578.94 --> 3582.059
[ __ ] insane Maniac yeah that's how

3580.859 --> 3583.98
that works

3582.059 --> 3585.6600000000003
I'm very well aware of that and also

3583.98 --> 3589.16
it's kind of too late to do anything

3585.66 --> 3589.16
about that they prevent that

3590.46 --> 3593.359
hmm

3595.2 --> 3599.8799999999997
ah you use my term physicality

3597.42 --> 3601.799
assumption bias often awesome yeah

3599.88 --> 3603.78
thanks yeah

3601.799 --> 3605.7
and

3603.78 --> 3607.3190000000004
that's just

3605.7 --> 3610.14
common sense

3607.319 --> 3613.079
I mean it is a really good

3610.14 --> 3616.319
conception I'm very proud of having

3613.079 --> 3618.119
pointed that out also because I am

3616.319 --> 3621.119
genuinely

3618.119 --> 3624.119
the first to do that

3621.119 --> 3629.2400000000002
like there is no such thing that exists

3624.119 --> 3629.2400000000002
in Psychology before I pointed it out

3631.4 --> 3636.299
I'm very proud

3633.839 --> 3638.52
to have done that and you could argue

3636.299 --> 3641.25
that it is one of my first achievements

3638.52 --> 3643.619
as a psychometer

3641.25 --> 3645.78
[Music]

3643.619 --> 3648.54
most physicality assumption wise because

3645.78 --> 3650.8190000000004
it's like really specifically psychology

3648.54 --> 3652.14
based

3650.819 --> 3655.859
right

3652.14 --> 3658.3799999999997
although I definitely would add like my

3655.859 --> 3660.96
insight on the Mandela effect

3658.38 --> 3662.7000000000003
as a psychotomer thing

3660.96 --> 3665.76
whereas like the psychology

3662.7 --> 3667.3799999999997
psychological aesthetic sense is is

3665.76 --> 3670.8590000000004
playing with you and how that works

3667.38 --> 3672.81
that's also psychology

3670.859 --> 3675.24
and basically psychotomy

3672.81 --> 3677.5789999999997
[Music]

3675.24 --> 3679.859
I'd call it the aesthetic sense it is

3677.579 --> 3681.96
based on what the function is I don't

3679.859 --> 3684.0
know it might be an identified part of

3681.96 --> 3686.46
the brain the front lobe somewhere or

3684.0 --> 3689.64
something that specifically does that

3686.46 --> 3693.5
process I don't know how far that study

3689.64 --> 3695.8799999999997
has gone in in medicine

3693.5 --> 3697.859
precisely they could pinpoint it or if

3695.88 --> 3700.7400000000002
they could pinpoint it at all

3697.859 --> 3702.0589999999997
but I've given it a name and that is the

3700.74 --> 3705.7799999999997
aesthetic sense

3702.059 --> 3707.7000000000003
it's a it's an intermittent processor

3705.78 --> 3713.3590000000004
between

3707.7 --> 3713.359
your input data and your memory

3713.69 --> 3720.42
[Music]

3718.559 --> 3723.26
it is a thing that happens probably

3720.42 --> 3723.26
provably

3732.48 --> 3736.339
all right and by the way physicality

3734.16 --> 3739.92
assumption bias is not

3736.339 --> 3743.099
specifically Celestial but it does apply

3739.92 --> 3745.14
to the celestials the most

3743.099 --> 3747.48
it's really where it comes into play Big

3745.14 --> 3749.2799999999997
Time like oh you're looking at the moon

3747.48 --> 3752.22
oh you think that's an object yeah it

3749.28 --> 3755.2400000000002
looks really like an object yeah

3752.22 --> 3755.24
but it isn't though

3759.96 --> 3762.7400000000002
like that

3763.02 --> 3769.16
what I mean physicality assumption bias

3765.48 --> 3769.16
also applies to rainbows

3769.74 --> 3775.22
you still get an impression like that's

3771.78 --> 3775.2200000000003
a physical thing you're seeing

3775.74 --> 3782.2799999999997
even though it is a hologram

3778.7 --> 3785.4199999999996
interestingly a hologram that is derived

3782.28 --> 3785.42
from the celestials

live FTD show today by the way I have no

4020.72 --> 4024.0389999999998
yeah seems like it

4026.98 --> 4032.96
all right yeah well it depends on like

4030.559 --> 4034.46
how big your like what the resolution on

4032.96 --> 4039.2
your screen is

4034.46 --> 4039.2

4073.28 --> 4078.2000000000003
recently by the way

4075.74 --> 4079.7
like I haven't even seen him around

4078.2 --> 4080.96
since

4079.7 --> 4083.18
you like

4080.96 --> 4085.039
timed out

4083.18 --> 4087.2599999999998
somebody

4085.039 --> 4089.619

him around

all right and there's all kinds of

4146.0 --> 4151.46
ruckus going around I mean already said

4148.04 --> 4154.16
like it got into this Ruckus with John

4151.46 --> 4157.819
got into a Ruckus with Godzilla who

4154.16 --> 4159.8589999999995
apparently is a non-atomist now

4157.819 --> 4162.14
it's like what the [ __ ] is going on with

4159.859 --> 4164.54
this crap

4162.14 --> 4168.64
deal with his upward Rising Earth and

4164.54 --> 4173.14
now Godzilla with oh atoms don't exist

4168.64 --> 4173.14
they've never been measured or proven

4173.719 --> 4178.1
what the hell is going on why is

4175.88 --> 4179.81
everybody like trying to find an excuse

no he didn't even go there she he said

4261.02 --> 4263.9800000000005
that just like

4264.14 --> 4269.719
attempts now exist

4267.38 --> 4271.88
like it's all molecules and they don't

4269.719 --> 4274.04
even know about it it was just really

4271.88 --> 4278.36
ridiculous I tried to tell him like no

4274.04 --> 4281.179
atomism is very much

4278.36 --> 4283.219
been proven because there's chemistry

4281.179 --> 4285.9800000000005
and there's quantum mechanics in both

4283.219 --> 4289.2390000000005

4319.4 --> 4323.599999999999
damn it

4321.62 --> 4327.26
I don't know what it is I think that the

Gusto energy drink didn't really hit

4327.26 --> 4335.56
the spot this time a little bit uneasy

hope that goes away soon

4346.4 --> 4351.259999999999
yeah also I'm gonna get some make some

4349.34 --> 4353.84
proper dinner

4351.26 --> 4356.84
this evening so hopefully I'll be like

4353.84 --> 4359.0
restore tomorrow because I just I it's

4356.84 --> 4361.28
been way too long since I've actually

4359.0 --> 4362.54
made like a really serious complete

4361.28 --> 4365.48
dinner

4362.54 --> 4367.28
for myself I mean yeah chicken broccoli

4365.48 --> 4370.04
is great and all but it's

4367.28 --> 4372.92
it's kind of simplistic

4370.04 --> 4375.86
so I'm gonna make chili con car without

4372.92 --> 4377.659

4375.86 --> 4379.4
there's a lot of different vegetables

4377.659 --> 4382.879999999999
and stuff and

4379.4 --> 4384.86
hopefully that will like fill in certain

4382.88 --> 4386.78
spots that have been blank for a while

4384.86 --> 4390.759999999999

4410.12 --> 4416.719

4413.36 --> 4421.339999999999
need a thousand ADP

4421.34 --> 4427.400000000001
over there just fine

okay Marco cool but I mean why do you

4469.699 --> 4476.919999999999

use niggle in a sentence I didn't catch

4748.28 --> 4750.4

wow mpo that's brutal

4763.66 --> 4766.8099999999995
[Music]

4774.8 --> 4780.679
are electrons in orbit

4778.76 --> 4783.34
but more like a field yeah it is more

4780.679 --> 4783.34
like a field

4785.36 --> 4789.08
you're right to think about it like that

4787.46 --> 4792.9800000000005
because it is

4789.08 --> 4794.659
I think electrons are exactly little

4792.98 --> 4796.699
fields

4794.659 --> 4801.0199999999995
and they're just

4796.699 --> 4803.239
once the field retracts from the shell

4801.02 --> 4807.080000000001
of the

4803.239 --> 4809.419999999999
material mesh proton neutrons then it

4807.08 --> 4812.3
turns into

4809.42 --> 4814.46
like basically like a

4812.3 --> 4817.76
it's like a shell that just collapses

4814.46 --> 4819.44
and then it becomes the electron which

4817.76 --> 4820.64
would be considered like a particle

4819.44 --> 4822.5
because

4820.64 --> 4825.860000000001
well that's how it's considered but

4822.5 --> 4829.46
technically electricity in all forms

4825.86 --> 4831.699
expresses itself in itself in fields

4829.46 --> 4835.4800000000005
magnetic field

4831.699 --> 4835.48
electron field

4836.06 --> 4841.400000000001
right it's all Fields that's what I

4839.54 --> 4843.98
think

4841.4 --> 4845.739
how dare you Arwin you barely even know

4843.98 --> 4847.699
anything about

4845.739 --> 4850.459999999999
electrics yeah

4847.699 --> 4853.12
but what I've seen thus far is that

4850.46 --> 4855.14
there's a lot of talk aways

4853.12 --> 4857.599999999999
electromagnetic waves when it's all

4855.14 --> 4859.88
[ __ ] Fields all of it is just Fields

4857.6 --> 4862.280000000001
it's a field it's a field it's a field

4859.88 --> 4865.04
what do you call that oh this and that

4862.28 --> 4867.38
yeah but it's a field

4865.04 --> 4869.92
it's the thing that just extends beyond

4867.38 --> 4869.92
the physical

4870.38 --> 4874.76
and it's a feel that it stays there it

4872.659 --> 4876.799999999999
has a distance and it's just at that set

4874.76 --> 4878.900000000001
distance and it's this weird Quantum

4876.8 --> 4882.56
locking effect and all that

4878.9 --> 4882.5599999999995
yeah fields

4890.62 --> 4897.159
and interestingly enough one aspect

4893.9 --> 4900.44
about Fields is that there are

4897.159 --> 4902.179
instantaneous right magnetism doesn't

4900.44 --> 4905.9
have a speed

4902.179 --> 4909.7390000000005
it's a field it manifests it's just boom

4905.9 --> 4913.46
it's there it's there it charges up boom

4909.739 --> 4916.099999999999
it's there it doesn't go oh no it's boom

4913.46 --> 4919.94
it's there

4916.1 --> 4922.6990000000005
so if light is instantaneous as well

4919.94 --> 4924.0199999999995
then maybe

4922.699 --> 4927.199
light

4924.02 --> 4930.219
and electricity are more related than I

4927.199 --> 4930.219
originally thought

4930.739 --> 4936.08
what if light and electricity are both

4933.44 --> 4940.04
Fields not waves

4936.08 --> 4942.62
not particles but fields

4940.04 --> 4945.199
a field is instantaneous light is

4942.62 --> 4947.5
instantaneous

4945.199 --> 4952.0
now the thing is is that electric

4947.5 --> 4952.0
discharge is not instantaneous

4956.42 --> 4960.86
but a field created by charged

4959.239 --> 4964.58
electricity

4960.86 --> 4964.58
is instantaneous

4964.94 --> 4971.54
so discharge not instantaneous charge

4969.219 --> 4973.84
instantaneous what do you think about

4971.54 --> 4973.84
that

4976.67 --> 4981.92
[Music]

4978.679 --> 4984.9400000000005

4992.06 --> 4996.400000000001
that's right Emma Peel I like you

5011.08 --> 5018.239
sorry a bit forward it's just

5015.76 --> 5018.2390000000005
all right

5022.32 --> 5025.63
[Music]

5031.14 --> 5034.92
still you look not good

5035.92 --> 5042.04
no complications

5038.98 --> 5043.48
I take it well you're not yeah sounds

5042.04 --> 5045.4
good then

5043.48 --> 5048.339999999999
are you trying like the honey and the

5045.4 --> 5050.82
colloidal silver to Quicken the the skin

5048.34 --> 5050.82
healing

5053.84 --> 5056.869000000001
[Music]

5057.12 --> 5063.88
electron is not a physical particle yeah

5060.699 --> 5065.739
but it's just a quanta just like light

5063.88 --> 5068.62
is considered a quanta

5065.739 --> 5070.9
I mean just because the model is atomic

5068.62 --> 5076.08
doesn't mean that they actually then

5070.9 --> 5076.08
reify it into an atom-like thing

5082.78 --> 5088.659
right in the electron

5085.0 --> 5092.44
is only a particle within the atomic

5088.659 --> 5095.379999999999
model because that way you can organize

5092.44 --> 5098.98
it properly

5095.38 --> 5103.54
that's what they do it for

5098.98 --> 5105.459999999999
atomic model is like a organizing

5103.54 --> 5108.06
structure

5105.46 --> 5108.06
you see

5108.4 --> 5112.299999999999
it's when you start to take everything

5110.199 --> 5114.719
about it literal that it becomes

5112.3 --> 5114.719
deceiving

5124.06 --> 5128.1990000000005
that is your own beat well you should

5125.8 --> 5130.42
learn how to communicate that beef

5128.199 --> 5134.4
better dude because

5130.42 --> 5134.4
there's maggots all over your beef

5136.96 --> 5139.32
should

5139.84 --> 5143.159000000001
put some salt on that

5143.52 --> 5146.719
[Music]

5148.36 --> 5150.839999999999
okay

5155.56 --> 5160.84
now your point is like oh atoms don't

5158.199 --> 5163.36
exist they are not measured

5160.84 --> 5165.2390000000005
and then my point is is that the atomic

5163.36 --> 5170.08
model is

5165.239 --> 5172.659
exclusively the foundation of chemistry

5170.08 --> 5173.92
like exclusively

5172.659 --> 5177.699
as in

5173.92 --> 5181.42
nobody has ever achieved to define

5177.699 --> 5183.9
chemistry in another model like not even

5181.42 --> 5183.9
close

5185.02 --> 5189.52
and thus

5186.94 --> 5192.759999999999
with the preponderance of

5189.52 --> 5195.52
scientific evidence within chemistry

5192.76 --> 5200.320000000001
you could absolutely state that

5195.52 --> 5203.38
the atomic model must be correct

5200.32 --> 5205.96
even though you can't measure it because

5203.38 --> 5209.92
all the things in chemistry work the way

5205.96 --> 5213.36
they do exactly as predicted because of

5209.92 --> 5213.36
the atomic model assumption

5213.52 --> 5216.76
yeah

5214.78 --> 5220.139
chemistry can't work without it and

5216.76 --> 5220.139
neither can quantum mechanics

5233.02 --> 5238.360000000001
so the point is it's it's to point at

5235.36 --> 5240.88
like oh it's not real it's not real

5238.36 --> 5244.239
that's just Pete and Peach [ __ ] man it's

5240.88 --> 5247.0
it's pointless skepticism

5244.239 --> 5251.08
there's a better way to present it like

5247.0 --> 5253.739
I do like I have right now on the show I

5251.08 --> 5253.739
just did that

5255.31 --> 5258.389
[Music]

5270.76 --> 5275.280000000001
you're being friends for it yeah no

5275.679 --> 5278.9400000000005
I don't work like that

5286.42 --> 5292.4800000000005
no the way our Godzilla argued it was

5289.239 --> 5294.82
ridiculous and that remains you made an

5292.48 --> 5297.159
ass up yourself

5294.82 --> 5301.38
a whole bunch of people in fed don't

5297.159 --> 5301.379999999999
trust you Godzilla because of that

5301.6 --> 5307.4800000000005
because you seem to be too casual

5305.139 --> 5310.4400000000005
about your approach of these very

5307.48 --> 5310.44
serious subjects

5318.1 --> 5324.76
they're not talking about in this chat

5321.46 --> 5327.639
I'm talking about what you did yesterday

5324.76 --> 5330.52
it's ridiculous

5327.639 --> 5334.56
keeping harping on oh it's not been

5330.52 --> 5334.56
visual we haven't seen an atom

5335.38 --> 5340.38
yes he and they're doing this [ __ ]

5337.659 --> 5340.379999999999
exactly

5355.06 --> 5360.6990000000005
I can't defend yourself

5358.36 --> 5362.62
what do you call spamming the chat in

5360.699 --> 5366.04
some triggered response defending

5362.62 --> 5367.84
yourself yeah you can definitely do that

5366.04 --> 5370.26
if it's gonna help you is this another

5367.84 --> 5370.26
matter

5380.64 --> 5386.139
[Music]

5383.08 --> 5389.08
the point is is Ryu refused to give

5386.139 --> 5391.3
recognition for my argument as to why

5389.08 --> 5393.58
Atomic models

5391.3 --> 5395.5
have to be

5393.58 --> 5397.96
and it doesn't like there could be stuff

5395.5 --> 5399.34
within the atomic models

5397.96 --> 5403.06
further

5399.34 --> 5406.6
but on that level the atomic model is

5403.06 --> 5409.42
very reliable because the entirety of

5406.6 --> 5412.3
chemistry wouldn't work

5409.42 --> 5415.0
otherwise there's no

5412.3 --> 5417.659000000001
like really blatant

5415.0 --> 5419.8
aberrations where it's just like yeah

5417.659 --> 5423.46
chemistry works like this and there and

5419.8 --> 5426.28
there except for that part that part is

5423.46 --> 5429.1
like yeah it just completely is

5426.28 --> 5431.86
inexplicable this happens like no there

5429.1 --> 5434.8
is no such thing left

5431.86 --> 5439.54
there are some micro aberrations here

5434.8 --> 5442.719
and there especially with like uh

5439.54 --> 5445.659
things like filtering gases there seem

5442.719 --> 5448.0
to be some really weird effects that may

5445.659 --> 5451.08
transpire in such processes when you

5448.0 --> 5454.0
like micro molecular filtering gases

5451.08 --> 5456.699
weird things happen you could argue

5454.0 --> 5458.679
there's even transmutation taking place

5456.699 --> 5461.08
but

5458.679 --> 5463.78
that's really the thing it's with the

5461.08 --> 5465.88
gases when gas behavior happens in

5463.78 --> 5468.88
filtering right that's where the weird

5465.88 --> 5470.679
aberrant stuff comes in but all the

5468.88 --> 5473.02
other things straightforward chemical

5470.679 --> 5475.84
reactions and all that it is like

5473.02 --> 5479.56
perfectly predicted

5475.84 --> 5482.4400000000005
like perfectly guys this is not like oh

5479.56 --> 5485.159000000001
yeah oh it's it's roughly between this

5482.44 --> 5489.28
and that no no it's like perfectly

5485.159 --> 5492.638999999999
predictable yeah that only happens

5489.28 --> 5494.5599999999995
if the foundational core elements that

5492.639 --> 5499.42
you're using to construct the entire

5494.56 --> 5503.1990000000005
lore is correct

5499.42 --> 5505.719
if it wasn't correct then you'd have

5503.199 --> 5508.98
holes everywhere that are continually

5505.719 --> 5512.26
being ignored there aren't any

5508.98 --> 5515.199
thus the only logical conclusion based

5512.26 --> 5520.4800000000005
on the preponderance of evidence is that

5515.199 --> 5523.419999999999
the atomic model very very much works

5520.48 --> 5526.259999999999
it is a reliable assumption to go with

5523.42 --> 5526.26
mechanically

5529.84 --> 5534.639
and it's not about mainstream this is

5532.0 --> 5537.04
about practical application it's about

5534.639 --> 5540.400000000001
the sheer preponderance of applications

5537.04 --> 5545.739
with chemistry it proves it it proves

5540.4 --> 5548.138999999999
the utilization proves it's correct

5545.739 --> 5549.879999999999
and it doesn't matter what it is it

5548.139 --> 5552.639
doesn't matter it is a little ball

5549.88 --> 5554.62
moving around other little balls or how

5552.639 --> 5557.5
they represent it like it's fluents and

5554.62 --> 5560.38
moons that's irrelevant

5557.5 --> 5563.56
what is relevant is the division factor

5560.38 --> 5567.04
it's the ratios how much of this how

5563.56 --> 5570.9400000000005
much of that and that thing how much of

5567.04 --> 5573.82
this how much of that the ratios and the

5570.94 --> 5576.4
ratios within chemistry and atomism are

5573.82 --> 5578.679
correct they got it right and that's why

5576.4 --> 5580.659
it all works

5578.679 --> 5585.159
because it's about the ratios it's not

5580.659 --> 5585.5199999999995
about the representation of the shape of

5585.159 --> 5586.9
it

5585.52 --> 5588.76
[Music]

5586.9 --> 5590.62
like yeah you could represent the

5588.76 --> 5592.96
singular atom and then you have the

5590.62 --> 5595.42
Electoral layer or a little ball

5592.96 --> 5598.3
floating around it supposedly and the

5595.42 --> 5600.76
internal elements proton neutrons

5598.3 --> 5604.2390000000005
stacked up against one another

5600.76 --> 5607.360000000001
right that's just a conceptual

5604.239 --> 5609.4
representation to make it palatable to

5607.36 --> 5611.679
the average mind

5609.4 --> 5615.94
but it doesn't mean that it's literally

5611.679 --> 5619.84
that that part is like a visualization

5615.94 --> 5622.0
experiment because you can't see it and

5619.84 --> 5624.82
that's Godzilla's point you can't see it

5622.0 --> 5626.159
yeah we get it you can't see it oh yeah

5624.82 --> 5628.84
but

5626.159 --> 5631.599999999999
based on the thing that you can't see

5628.84 --> 5636.360000000001
the conception that they made about it

5631.6 --> 5640.179
and how they then utilize it in practice

5636.36 --> 5643.12
proves it's correct you don't always

5640.179 --> 5646.3
have to see something or be able to

5643.12 --> 5649.9
sense something to figure out whether it

5646.3 --> 5651.159000000001
is the way you think it is or not

5649.9 --> 5655.42
yeah

5651.159 --> 5658.12
I mean yes seeing perceiving is very

5655.42 --> 5661.0
useful and like reliable makes it almost

5658.12 --> 5665.159
more empirical immediately but it's not

5661.0 --> 5668.38
the only way yeah yeah you can't see

5665.159 --> 5670.239
gases on average there's some gases you

5668.38 --> 5672.76
can see but most gases you don't see

5670.239 --> 5675.94
them right so perception

5672.76 --> 5678.6990000000005
definitely did not lead to the

5675.94 --> 5680.799999999999
acknowledgment of gases

5678.699 --> 5683.98
because you don't see him

5680.8 --> 5686.1990000000005
so that's really more close to your

5683.98 --> 5687.759999999999
sensory so you should realize that just

5686.199 --> 5690.28
because you can't

5687.76 --> 5694.1990000000005
see an atom doesn't mean that it it's

5690.28 --> 5694.199
not real that it isn't that

5695.02 --> 5701.139
you gotta submit to that

5698.739 --> 5704.459999999999
or you're just gonna end up just being

5701.139 --> 5704.46
stubborn and belligerent

5707.199 --> 5709.62
anyway

5719.92 --> 5724.1990000000005
yeah you did kind of ask for that Emma

5721.96 --> 5724.199
fuel

5738.52 --> 5742.6
but I know no atom has been split yeah

5741.04 --> 5745.0
well that's

5742.6 --> 5747.1
that's the danger what's the danger

5745.0 --> 5751.02
what's the danger about an atom being

5747.1 --> 5751.02
split which says it can be split

5751.719 --> 5757.179
as far as I know if you split an atom

5755.62 --> 5761.8
it

5757.179 --> 5765.1
basically falls into material components

5761.8 --> 5768.04
that do not amount to the same substance

5765.1 --> 5770.26
that's how you know right you divide

5768.04 --> 5772.179
down a substance until you can divide it

5770.26 --> 5773.8
no more and when you then attempt to

5772.179 --> 5778.1990000000005
divide it further

5773.8 --> 5778.1990000000005
it turns into something else

5778.239 --> 5785.44
that's how they came to the conclusion

5781.12 --> 5787.719
of the minimum size of atoms

5785.44 --> 5790.08
it's like we can't split it down any

5787.719 --> 5790.08
further

5792.1 --> 5795.659000000001
that's how they got to that point

5799.239 --> 5802.299999999999
right

5800.5 --> 5803.98
and yes

5802.3 --> 5806.9800000000005
atomic

5803.98 --> 5806.98
fission

5807.46 --> 5812.199
like supposedly nuclear bomb explosions

5810.04 --> 5815.46
yeah that doesn't happen there's no

5812.199 --> 5818.5
immersive the energy of the entire

5815.46 --> 5821.76
universe is secretly locked in every

5818.5 --> 5825.46
atom and then when you split it open

5821.76 --> 5827.9800000000005
yeah that's complete horseshit there's

5825.46 --> 5830.86
definitely not the energy of the entire

5827.98 --> 5836.638999999999
universe locked in every single atom

5830.86 --> 5836.639
yeah that's a horror [ __ ] sci-fi story

5836.92 --> 5841.6
okay

5838.6 --> 5844.0
but I'm pretty damn certain that under

5841.6 --> 5846.9400000000005
the right circumstances you can

5844.0 --> 5849.699
basically split down an atom even

5846.94 --> 5853.259999999999
further it's just not gonna be the same

5849.699 --> 5853.259999999999
substance as leftovers

5853.96 --> 5861.1
right you get you basically get to the

5858.82 --> 5863.799999999999
to this quickly line divination part

5861.1 --> 5865.54
right

5863.8 --> 5868.360000000001
the big

5865.54 --> 5871.32
High drum Collider squiggly line

5868.36 --> 5871.32
definition machine

5872.139 --> 5877.06
but yeah when you shoot an atom and you

5875.44 --> 5879.28
split it apart

5877.06 --> 5881.38
there's not gonna be any leftovers

5879.28 --> 5884.86
except for squiggly lines and energy

5881.38 --> 5887.46
stuff right definitely not an atomic

5884.86 --> 5887.46
explosion

5895.78 --> 5900.12
hadron colliders is Plato's kids

5902.739 --> 5907.659
I think it's just I think it's a giant

5905.44 --> 5909.46
divination machine it's I think

5907.659 --> 5912.58
hadronical light is seriously I think

5909.46 --> 5914.26
the Hadron Collider is basically

5912.58 --> 5915.76
one of those

5914.26 --> 5918.58
bowls

5915.76 --> 5921.219
with a hand of Bones you throw the hand

5918.58 --> 5923.739
the bones and then how it falls in the

5921.219 --> 5925.9
bowl tells you exactly

5923.739 --> 5927.5199999999995
what's going to happen in relation to

5925.9 --> 5930.339999999999
your thought or your feelings right

5927.52 --> 5933.900000000001
divination and I think that the Hadron

5930.34 --> 5936.88
Collider is like the most colossal

5933.9 --> 5939.82
divination machine that has ever been

5936.88 --> 5942.82
created under the guise of science I

5939.82 --> 5945.58
literally think that's what it is

5942.82 --> 5948.639
it's literally reading tea leaves

5945.58 --> 5951.34
throwing the bones it's just a insanely

5948.639 --> 5952.42
absurd giant version of it that's what I

5951.34 --> 5955.2390000000005
think it is

5952.42 --> 5956.8
you like the itching and yeah but the

5955.239 --> 5959.199
itching is there's actually really

5956.8 --> 5960.639
brilliant logic behind you Ching slo-mo

5959.199 --> 5962.799999999999
moon buggy

5960.639 --> 5965.1990000000005
it's magical me itching is magical

5962.8 --> 5966.88
because of the structure I think that

5965.199 --> 5971.08
the iching is the the person that

5966.88 --> 5975.719
figured it out was really close

5971.08 --> 5975.719
really attuned with the pattern

5978.34 --> 5981.9400000000005
etching is very magical like my dad was

5980.38 --> 5985.0
into that for a bit

5981.94 --> 5988.239
like in my 20s

5985.0 --> 5989.38
I was dealing with it a lot it's very

5988.239 --> 5992.739
interesting

5989.38 --> 5994.84
also based on the elements

5992.739 --> 5997.839999999999
which makes it very fascinating because

5994.84 --> 6001.4400000000005
I tried a craft reference things within

5997.84 --> 6004.04
the iching with my element system

6001.44 --> 6004.04
right

6005.28 --> 6010.86
air Spirit fire Consciousness water Soul

6009.3 --> 6013.9800000000005
Earth body

6010.86 --> 6016.08
and then to see how in the itching the

6013.98 --> 6017.879999999999
elements are rearranged in how well

6016.08 --> 6021.0
there is a

6017.88 --> 6022.92
are there any pattern resonations in

6021.0 --> 6026.34
that

6022.92 --> 6028.82
it's like is there another fractal layer

6026.34 --> 6028.82
to it

6034.32 --> 6039.739
always trying to test out those types of

6036.659 --> 6039.739
things anyway

6042.9 --> 6047.9
there are not physical representations

6045.06 --> 6047.900000000001
of atoms

6051.179 --> 6057.9
no that's Tech but there are physical

6054.98 --> 6061.0199999999995
representations there's just no absolute

6057.9 --> 6063.299999999999
it's just a it's just a model it's a

6061.02 --> 6067.639
representation

6063.3 --> 6067.639
you can't really see what it looks like

6068.76 --> 6072.84
right

6069.739 --> 6076.159
the farthest you can get is an electron

6072.84 --> 6076.159000000001
microscope readout

6076.38 --> 6081.96
but all that gives you is just a little

6080.04 --> 6084.8
ball

6081.96 --> 6084.8
that's it

6104.46 --> 6108.719
right and by the way the same goes for

6106.619 --> 6112.46
cells

6108.719 --> 6112.46
I mean do realize that

6115.08 --> 6121.08
I think I got this correct it might be

6117.42 --> 6124.32
wrong but just for for safety I'm saying

6121.08 --> 6126.659
that but I I've gotten strong

6124.32 --> 6129.299999999999
Impressions that

6126.659 --> 6132.599999999999
genetics

6129.3 --> 6135.360000000001
like that this supposed genetic stuff

6132.6 --> 6136.4400000000005
like the the irks and the Y stuff and

6135.36 --> 6139.139
all that

6136.44 --> 6143.159
that

6139.139 --> 6146.46
it has never actually been detected in a

6143.159 --> 6151.199
living cell like at all that it only

6146.46 --> 6154.76
becomes visible detectable after like

6151.199 --> 6158.159
basically dismembering a cell

6154.76 --> 6161.219
by breaking it apart and adding some

6158.159 --> 6163.86
substance or something that then

6161.219 --> 6166.219
colors what they say is the genetic

6163.86 --> 6166.219
strand

6166.32 --> 6172.199
but it's like indetectable

6169.92 --> 6175.139
in a living cell

6172.199 --> 6178.5
so like even if you'd attempt to like

6175.139 --> 6180.96
detect it with micro resonance like it's

6178.5 --> 6183.719
not there and I'm talking about

6180.96 --> 6186.4800000000005
like high-tech German new medicine based

6183.719 --> 6190.26
resonance stuff

6186.48 --> 6192.78
that is like technology of yeah of like

6190.26 --> 6194.06
a hundred years ahead of time like and

6192.78 --> 6195.719
they can't

6194.06 --> 6199.4400000000005
detect

6195.719 --> 6202.9800000000005
the genetics within a living cell

6199.44 --> 6205.379999999999
like not even with resonance detection

6202.98 --> 6208.699
okay

6205.38 --> 6208.6990000000005
that's saying something

6208.86 --> 6214.739
and it's a similar type of concern

6212.28 --> 6217.5599999999995
as Godzilla is having with what we can't

6214.739 --> 6220.08
really see atoms

6217.56 --> 6222.6
except this one has much more impact

6220.08 --> 6224.88
because it's literally biology and

6222.6 --> 6227.04
there's so many claims

6224.88 --> 6230.400000000001
about genetics they even claim that

6227.04 --> 6234.139
they've already deciphered

6230.4 --> 6234.138999999999
or the genetics itself

6234.179 --> 6238.56
even though it's apparently completely

6236.76 --> 6242.46
impossible

6238.56 --> 6245.06
to actually detect genetic material in a

6242.46 --> 6245.06
living cell

6250.739 --> 6256.259999999999
what the [ __ ]

6252.679 --> 6258.3
it doesn't it's a disgusting human

6256.26 --> 6260.9400000000005
obsession

6258.3 --> 6263.4800000000005
it's a human sexual perversion based

6260.94 --> 6263.48
obsession

6263.54 --> 6268.26
to think that people can choose their

6266.219 --> 6272.06
sex

6268.26 --> 6278.719
I mean it's that's like a role-playing

6272.06 --> 6278.719
sexual role-playing mind game sickness

6279.78 --> 6285.48
it falls under

6282.239 --> 6288.659
like kinky stuff

6285.48 --> 6291.239
and all that it's and it's absolutely

6288.659 --> 6295.08
absurd that that's getting involved with

6291.239 --> 6298.638999999999
children it's absolutely absurd

6295.08 --> 6298.639
you don't choose your sex

6298.8 --> 6303.42
yeah you can play whatever you want when

6301.38 --> 6306.4800000000005
you're an adult in the bedroom although

6303.42 --> 6308.76
that stuff is kind of [ __ ] up and you

6306.48 --> 6311.638999999999
you better make sure that not every not

6308.76 --> 6313.92
only everybody that knows you gets to

6311.639 --> 6316.32
know let you do that because it makes

6313.92 --> 6319.139
you kind of [ __ ] up

6316.32 --> 6320.88
yeah weird kinky [ __ ] ooh sounds really

6319.139 --> 6323.88
funny or whatever it's kind of [ __ ] up

6320.88 --> 6326.46
it is it is not healthy

6323.88 --> 6328.679
it isn't and a lot of people that are

6326.46 --> 6330.3
into that do realize and know that and

6328.679 --> 6332.639
they do keep it kind of private because

6330.3 --> 6335.159000000001
they know it's [ __ ] up

6332.639 --> 6337.92
and they're not evil people necessarily

6335.159 --> 6340.0199999999995
right but if you're gonna like try to

6337.92 --> 6344.4
push that level

6340.02 --> 6346.8
of social engagement onto children it is

6344.4 --> 6348.9
beyond [ __ ]

6346.8 --> 6351.84
I mean that it is effectively straight

6348.9 --> 6355.679
out pedophilia to do such things to

6351.84 --> 6357.54
involve that sort of interaction with

6355.679 --> 6362.06
children telling them you can choose

6357.54 --> 6362.06
your that's totally [ __ ] up

6363.96 --> 6369.2390000000005
yeah

6366.659 --> 6371.699
[ __ ] are growing babies in back dude

6369.239 --> 6374.459999999999
they've been doing that for half a

6371.699 --> 6376.638999999999
century Godzilla here was born from a

6374.46 --> 6376.639
pond

6376.679 --> 6383.36
tell him Godzilla

6378.6 --> 6383.360000000001
tell him that you're actually a pot boy

6389.699 --> 6393.32
or did you forget about that

6399.179 --> 6403.26
yes

6400.5 --> 6405.239
yes Godzilla

6403.26 --> 6406.679
I know I called you that last night you

6405.239 --> 6410.218999999999
know why

6406.679 --> 6412.1990000000005
because you can't prove to me that

6410.219 --> 6415.5
you're not a pot boy because you don't

6412.199 --> 6417.54
have a photo of you as a baby coming out

6415.5 --> 6420.719
of your mother's vagina

6417.54 --> 6422.82
so in that case I'm just going to assume

6420.719 --> 6425.52
that you were born from a pod because

6422.82 --> 6428.119
that is technically possible

6425.52 --> 6428.119000000001
right

6432.119 --> 6438.0
just like you don't think that the

6435.06 --> 6441.38
atomic model is real

6438.0 --> 6441.38
because you can't see it

6447.719 --> 6456.679
we all are well yeah might be but I'm

6451.619 --> 6456.679
just gonna assume it of you in this case

6457.98 --> 6460.699
foreign

6469.3 --> 6472.399
[Music]

6475.59 --> 6479.959
[Music]

6489.15 --> 6492.389999999999
[Music]

6508.04 --> 6515.1
mantle conception or sexual conception I

6511.32 --> 6518.94
mean we were talking about your pod

6515.1 --> 6521.6990000000005
background and all that so this is

6518.94 --> 6523.919999999999
getting a little mixed

6521.699 --> 6528.178999999999
oh did anybody notice by the way that

6523.92 --> 6528.179
Twitter now is excellent

6528.98 --> 6535.08
Elon Musk did it again he was playing

6532.08 --> 6538.08
Diablo and laughing evil and now it to

6535.08 --> 6542.46
change a little Tweety Bird into an ax

6538.08 --> 6545.1
oh no who cares I know

6542.46 --> 6548.659
I just

6545.1 --> 6548.659000000001
felt like mentioning that

6553.44 --> 6556.699
let's be right back

6581.699 --> 6585.379999999999
yeah oh yeah

6597.06 --> 6600.1990000000005
down and back

6601.619 --> 6606.239
it was always called axes

6620.699 --> 6624.799999999999
but really if it wasn't Mandela then you

6623.28 --> 6628.5599999999995
would

6624.8 --> 6632.28
then go go look up Angry Birds the game

6628.56 --> 6635.76
now it's angry X

6632.28 --> 6638.699
there was never a Tweety Bird game

6635.76 --> 6642.4400000000005
and Twitter was never a bird there's no

6638.699 --> 6642.44
more birds it's all X now

6654.66 --> 6659.82
[Music]

6657.26 --> 6663.2390000000005
anybody who's listening it's it's not

6659.82 --> 6665.94
actually a Mandela effect it's just

6663.239 --> 6669.718999999999
Elon

6665.94 --> 6672.659
doing his [ __ ] stamp

6669.719 --> 6676.28
it's like his

6672.659 --> 6676.28
what do you call that uh

6681.42 --> 6688.26
damn it what do you call that [ __ ]

6685.08 --> 6692.34
yeah it's his gravity I mean it's just

6688.26 --> 6696.659000000001
oh X is like for Elon Musk that's like

6692.34 --> 6699.119000000001
his signature is like oh Elon Was Here I

6696.659 --> 6700.32
Am the badass

6699.119 --> 6703.759999999999
that's

6700.32 --> 6703.759999999999
him like X

6710.48 --> 6713.62
[Music]

6717.86 --> 6724.259999999999
X little X's okay that is funny Emma

6721.56 --> 6726.54
Peel unfortunately I'm not really that

6724.26 --> 6728.9400000000005
good with CGI

6726.54 --> 6731.239
but that sounds like a really funny idea

6728.94 --> 6731.239
though

6736.44 --> 6742.219
it never was DMX it was always DM tweet

6743.9 --> 6749.239
good one good one LSG

6754.679 --> 6760.9400000000005
stay away from tweep triple tweet

6758.28 --> 6760.94
content

6761.34 --> 6764.719
oh dear right here

6776.1 --> 6781.4400000000005
and have you seen Vin Diesel's trip

6778.98 --> 6784.099999999999
triple tweet

6781.44 --> 6784.099999999999
the movie

6816.78 --> 6822.719
you were on Twitter two weeks and then

6819.0 --> 6825.96
dumped it it's full of bots and crazy

6822.719 --> 6828.26
ass Gammas there anyway Emma Peel I'm

6825.96 --> 6831.6
not I'm kind of hanging around

6828.26 --> 6833.280000000001
because it is sometimes kind of useful

6831.6 --> 6836.04
to see what's happening in the

6833.28 --> 6840.259999999999
Netherlands and

6836.04 --> 6842.94
and I'm doing it well to basically be a

6840.26 --> 6844.3
advertisement point for the YouTube show

6842.94 --> 6846.178999999999
here

6844.3 --> 6848.76
[Music]

6846.179 --> 6850.02
I mean if I'm not showing up live for a

6848.76 --> 6852.360000000001
show

6850.02 --> 6855.360000000001
the go-to places Twitter

6852.36 --> 6857.759999999999
because there if I'm not having a show I

6855.36 --> 6860.04
will post a tweet

6857.76 --> 6862.280000000001
that says not doing a show today be back

6860.04 --> 6862.28
tomorrow

6866.65 --> 6870.119
[Music]

6867.84 --> 6872.04
right and it'll probably also be the

6870.119 --> 6875.719
place if I died somehow or whatever

6872.04 --> 6875.719
you'll probably read it there

6880.38 --> 6885.96
quit Facebook yeah good on you tarot

6883.5 --> 6888.239
although you probably should have never

6885.96 --> 6891.06
started a Facebook page

6888.239 --> 6894.178999999999
they've got your simulacrum

6891.06 --> 6897.679
like they Facebook never relinquishes

6894.179 --> 6897.679
any data they have of you

6897.719 --> 6906.3
I really avoided Facebook from the start

6901.739 --> 6908.94
like really really avoided it like

6906.3 --> 6912.4800000000005
if people would be taking pictures like

6908.94 --> 6915.299999999999
with photographs I'd go to them like

6912.48 --> 6918.299999999999
this is all fine but I'm not giving you

6915.3 --> 6919.320000000001
permission to upload my pictures on

6918.3 --> 6924.54
Facebook

6919.32 --> 6926.639
I'd literally say that around 2010 a lot

6924.54 --> 6928.5
because people were actually doing that

6926.639 --> 6932.04
I had to just say you're not getting

6928.5 --> 6934.739
permission to put that on Facebook

6932.04 --> 6937.139
like anywhere else is just fine but not

6934.739 --> 6939.48
on Facebook because they literally claim

6937.139 --> 6942.92
ownership

6939.48 --> 6942.919999999999
and you can never get it back

6943.32 --> 6949.619
never ever used Instagram no

6946.92 --> 6951.78
it's yeah I've heard a lot about

6949.619 --> 6953.82
Instagram through Owen Benjamin and he's

6951.78 --> 6956.0
getting swarmed by Gammas there all the

6953.82 --> 6956.0
time

6956.04 --> 6958.94
uh-huh

6964.58 --> 6968.46
okay Terry yeah that's fine hey if you'd

6967.32 --> 6970.88
like to hang around I have no problem

6968.46 --> 6970.88
with that

6971.46 --> 6973.639
thank you

6983.34 --> 6986.900000000001
what the [ __ ] Emma feel

6991.86 --> 6995.639
that ridiculous

6993.48 --> 6998.339999999999
[ __ ] are those

6995.639 --> 7001.639
you're from that City so you are a

criminal okay

7001.89 --> 7004.939
[Music]

7026.92 --> 7032.139
yes really that's gross

7037.76 --> 7040.42
yeah

NGL

7042.739 --> 7046.419999999999

7072.739 --> 7074.739
s

7078.38 --> 7082.249
[Music]

7082.52 --> 7091.52
not gonna oh yeah don't don't do that

7086.48 --> 7091.5199999999995
I'm not great with that kind of acronym

7094.82 --> 7101.84
hello by the way akumo virus

7098.02 --> 7104.360000000001
can't you just tighten like

7101.84 --> 7107.54
oh Premiere from Nathan oh yeah there's

7104.36 --> 7111.619
not going to be live fed today I guess

7107.54 --> 7113.54
I'll keep going on a little longer

7111.619 --> 7116.839999999999
but hey evil nightmare can't you just

7113.54 --> 7120.8
like change it into the title of your

7116.84 --> 7123.02
account into akumu virus 2 or something

7120.8 --> 7125.900000000001
that would be kind of helpful I don't

7123.02 --> 7128.719
like the word evil nightmare if you know

7125.9 --> 7131.138999999999
what I mean it's I'd rather have a kumu

7128.719 --> 7131.139
virus

7131.36 --> 7136.339999999999
because evil is real nightmares are real

7134.06 --> 7138.820000000001
viruses are not real so it's not as

7136.34 --> 7138.82
threatening

7140.119 --> 7145.219
on a subconscious level

7142.34 --> 7147.52
would you do that for me

7145.219 --> 7150.199
because you know I can't

7147.52 --> 7151.34
unblock your main account because I

7150.199 --> 7154.299999999999
don't have it blocked there's something

7151.34 --> 7154.3
weird going on there

7167.3 --> 7171.639
try later okay that would be awesome

7169.04 --> 7171.639
thanks

7176.179 --> 7179.7390000000005
this evil virus yes

7186.44 --> 7192.5
inducting yeah but I checked that too I

7189.26 --> 7196.280000000001
know how to get to my blocked list

7192.5 --> 7198.44
and I I have a really [ __ ] up trolls

7196.28 --> 7200.719
like Charlie Welch who stalks me

7198.44 --> 7202.94
literally in every freaking YouTube chat

7200.719 --> 7205.52
ever

7202.94 --> 7208.699
I got him blocked

7205.52 --> 7211.040000000001
but I don't have a Kuma virus blood

7208.699 --> 7212.78
it's something else and it happens to

7211.04 --> 7216.44
more people it's like

7212.78 --> 7219.92
it's just this weird blockage bug

7216.44 --> 7220.94
that YouTube does for no damn reason why

7219.92 --> 7225.4400000000005
the suck

7220.94 --> 7228.5599999999995
it's because it maina virus account is

7225.44 --> 7230.96
somehow blocked by YouTube to come here

7228.56 --> 7233.2390000000005
and by the way so is

7230.96 --> 7235.719
uh Rasta hats

7233.239 --> 7235.718999999999
account

7235.94 --> 7240.86
it might have something to do that they

7237.739 --> 7244.94
had a really weird back and forth like

7240.86 --> 7247.339999999999
really high level racist action stuff

7244.94 --> 7249.259999999999
I mean rest had like went a bit far it

7247.34 --> 7252.5
might be that they like moderator saw

7249.26 --> 7255.02
that like you two are permanently banned

7252.5 --> 7257.36
it might have been something like that

7255.02 --> 7259.76
like that they literally made it unable

7257.36 --> 7261.32
for those accounts to ever come back to

7259.76 --> 7263.4800000000005
my channel again

7261.32 --> 7266.239
without me being able to control

7263.48 --> 7268.699
anything about it

7266.239 --> 7271.098999999999
so

7268.699 --> 7273.28
I didn't block akumo virus's main

7271.099 --> 7273.28
account

7318.28 --> 7322.719
what am I gonna call this show

7326.09 --> 7329.6
[Music]

7333.26 --> 7337.360000000001
I thought it was pretty interesting but

7339.639 --> 7345.28
I guess I get like a draw atomism in it

7356.96 --> 7364.38
[Music]

7362.16 --> 7371.5
[Applause]

7364.38 --> 7371.5
[Music]

7375.25 --> 7378.329
[Music]

7379.14 --> 7384.5
[Applause]

7381.4 --> 7384.5
[Music]

7390.87 --> 7393.92
[Music]

7416.78 --> 7419.78
foreign

7443.06 --> 7446.26
let's try this

7448.54 --> 7455.54
choosing the sex no

7451.54 --> 7459.88
no no no no no no no no don't

7455.54 --> 7459.88
that's that's so evil

7460.159 --> 7465.28
am I you ever

7462.02 --> 7465.280000000001
a dangerous mind

7470.3 --> 7474.92
nah because I've called it the Devil

7472.94 --> 7479.199
comes to divide and conquer from within

7474.92 --> 7479.1990000000005
and how we know atoms exist

7487.699 --> 7491.5
is that good enough for you guys

7495.56 --> 7500.2390000000005
because like

7498.08 --> 7502.099
the darkness coming from within to

7500.239 --> 7505.4
divide has really been like an

7502.099 --> 7509.38
overarching overarching theme

7505.4 --> 7509.379999999999
for most of the subject of today

7511.099 --> 7514.88
atoms just like a globe no

7513.619 --> 7516.739
no it isn't

7514.88 --> 7519.34
kind of shitty remark is that George

7516.739 --> 7519.339999999999
Sanford

7520.099 --> 7524.7390000000005
atoms are not just like a globe

7528.52 --> 7535.400000000001
the point is is that the model for atoms

7532.639 --> 7537.92
is real and it works and it's all about

7535.4 --> 7540.638999999999
ratios

7537.92 --> 7544.34
it's not about the visual

7540.639 --> 7548.84
representations that are used

7544.34 --> 7553.599
for them when we deal

7548.84 --> 7553.599
with atoms as a conception

7555.8 --> 7563.119000000001
and ball Earth is exactly the opposite I

7559.76 --> 7566.780000000001
mean it's absolutely measurable it's all

7563.119 --> 7570.32
visual it's all right there

7566.78 --> 7572.9
and it's basically just being convoluted

7570.32 --> 7575.36
into convincing people that it is a ball

7572.9 --> 7577.339999999999
when it obviously isn't so it's exactly

7575.36 --> 7580.639
the opposite of atoms

7577.34 --> 7583.639
where with atoms it all really works out

7580.639 --> 7585.32
and it's kind of secondary how it's

7583.639 --> 7588.619
being represented oh it's being

7585.32 --> 7591.619
represented as little balls yeah

7588.619 --> 7593.08
but it's really irrelevant because it

7591.619 --> 7597.799999999999
works

7593.08 --> 7601.04
and we can't really tell we can't see

7597.8 --> 7603.02
yeah with the Earth we absolutely can

7601.04 --> 7605.599
tell we can see it right there we can

7603.02 --> 7608.360000000001
measure it we can literally walk it

7605.599 --> 7610.46
it's very palpable it's very measurable

7608.36 --> 7613.0
so it's exactly the opposite as with

7610.46 --> 7613.0
atoms

7615.8 --> 7621.159000000001
so the atoms are not just like the globe

7619.219 --> 7624.7390000000005
you could say that atomism

7621.159 --> 7627.28
representation is inspired on Globe

7624.739 --> 7627.28
cosmology

7627.739 --> 7633.339999999999
but they are not alike

7631.46 --> 7637.34
it's just

7633.34 --> 7637.34
inspiration source

7637.52 --> 7640.4800000000005
foreign

7643.239 --> 7651.4
musk drawings all atoms into a

7647.42 --> 7651.4
this it's funny but

7654.26 --> 7658.46
I mean him doing that is kind of a minor

7656.78 --> 7659.719
Point really I just wanted to bring it

7658.46 --> 7661.76
up because I thought it was kind of

7659.719 --> 7664.219
funny

7661.76 --> 7665.2390000000005
especially thinking of it as a Mandela

7664.219 --> 7668.199
effect

7665.239 --> 7668.199
that was a good one

7669.38 --> 7673.599
was that this was that skeptic

7682.52 --> 7687.820000000001
I don't know who said but it was funny

7685.04 --> 7690.679
and then I thought like yeah

7687.82 --> 7692.84
I always thought that Angry Birds was

7690.679 --> 7694.6990000000005
like Twitter the game I genuinely

7692.84 --> 7696.5
thought that I really was like yeah it's

7694.699 --> 7698.54
exactly like a Twitter bird

7696.5 --> 7701.719
so I thought like Angry Birds is like

7698.54 --> 7702.739
Twitter the game like an advertisement

7701.719 --> 7706.34
thing

7702.739 --> 7710.36
I I really thought that

7706.34 --> 7712.58
so if in my head it's so related then if

7710.36 --> 7714.619
you think that changing the bird into an

7712.58 --> 7717.679
axis and Mandela effect and naturally

7714.619 --> 7720.38
that would retroactively rub on on all

7717.679 --> 7724.099
Associated things so

7720.38 --> 7726.6990000000005
Angry Bird should be angry X

7724.099 --> 7726.6990000000005
right

7731.36 --> 7736.159
and then somebody inserted the uh like

7734.119 --> 7738.5
that everything that's X should be

7736.159 --> 7741.32
turned into a Twitter bird

7738.5 --> 7744.639
so you have Vin Diesel's triple Twitter

7741.32 --> 7744.639
bird the movie

7745.52 --> 7752.5
I don't know it was funny to do but it's

7747.8 --> 7752.5
not really a subject worthy for a title

7752.9 --> 7758.9
you have an angry X

7756.32 --> 7760.94
well better an angry X than an Angry

7758.9 --> 7764.98
Bird

7760.94 --> 7764.98
as in a woman you are still with

7769.46 --> 7774.4
oh wait you right that can be the other

7772.699 --> 7778.04
way around

7774.4 --> 7780.4
Malcolm tweet it's just spreading his

7778.04 --> 7780.4
message

7781.4 --> 7786.0199999999995
oh my God this could be really funny

7784.34 --> 7788.06
I never thought it had that much

7786.02 --> 7790.179
potential thinking of it as a Mandela

7788.06 --> 7790.179
effect

7807.139 --> 7809.679
foreign

7818.08 --> 7824.179
exists through inference and deduction

7822.92 --> 7827.42
and

7824.179 --> 7831.82
wisdom concerning ratios

7827.42 --> 7831.82
that's how we can prove atoms exist

7842.239 --> 7846.678999999999
the only thing we can't really prove

7845.119 --> 7851.78
is

7846.679 --> 7854.84
give them Absolute Visage like show them

7851.78 --> 7857.48
like an actual representation

7854.84 --> 7861.58
is that proof though yes

7857.48 --> 7861.58
yes it's absolute proof

7862.82 --> 7867.38
right

7864.139 --> 7870.38
it's just like proving that the Sun

7867.38 --> 7872.2390000000005
we don't know what the Sun is

7870.38 --> 7875.36
I suspect it's not even a physical

7872.239 --> 7877.58
object but we do know that the sun

7875.36 --> 7881.839999999999
basically

7877.58 --> 7883.94
creates or nourishes all life

7881.84 --> 7885.7390000000005
so just because we don't know what it is

7883.94 --> 7888.199
doesn't mean that it doesn't do that

7885.739 --> 7890.598999999999
with absolute certainty

7888.199 --> 7892.339999999999
so you could absolutely through logical

7890.599 --> 7895.82
inference

7892.34 --> 7897.56
say that there is a sun just because we

7895.82 --> 7899.719
don't know what it is it's absolutely

7897.56 --> 7903.7390000000005
there because of what it does

7899.719 --> 7906.38
and the same goes for the atomic model

7903.739 --> 7909.98
all of chemistry has been defined based

7906.38 --> 7913.88
on the conception of atoms and it works

7909.98 --> 7916.5199999999995
so damn well because of it yeah

7913.88 --> 7920.119
where before there wasn't an atomic

7916.52 --> 7921.92
model to guide Chemists in figuring out

7920.119 --> 7925.82
how it all works

7921.92 --> 7928.639
and then it wasn't as closed it wasn't

7925.82 --> 7931.28
as perfected

7928.639 --> 7934.9400000000005
what they came up with when it was still

7931.28 --> 7937.759999999999
like late Alchemy type chemistry

7934.94 --> 7940.098999999999
was the atomic model that really helped

7937.76 --> 7945.04
to perfect it

7940.099 --> 7945.04
there's no better model since

7952.76 --> 7957.6990000000005
is that proof though it's proof the

7954.86 --> 7957.699
model works yeah

7961.4 --> 7966.32
because of ratios

7963.98 --> 7968.239
because of ratios

7966.32 --> 7970.099
and the share preponderance of

7968.239 --> 7972.678999999999
applications

7970.099 --> 7976.119000000001
but it's really the ratios that that

7972.679 --> 7976.119
make it absolutely certain

7977.239 --> 7982.579
all of chemistry is based on ratios and

7980.3 --> 7987.04
that's how you know

7982.579 --> 7987.04
because it works so damn well

7989.659 --> 7994.82
I mean they got

7991.4 --> 7997.219
the ma the atomic mass and even

7994.82 --> 7999.88
volumetrics

7997.219 --> 7999.88
off

7999.98 --> 8006.459999999999
so they can already tell you how big in

8005.5 --> 8010.239
size

8006.46 --> 8011.44
the minimum size of a certain element is

8010.239 --> 8016.54
yeah

8011.44 --> 8018.098999999999
so there's even volume metric details of

8016.54 --> 8022.98
information

8018.099 --> 8022.9800000000005
I mean what the [ __ ] more do you need

8023.26 --> 8029.579000000001
yeah rations ratios

8026.32 --> 8031.299999999999
not not a food ration a racial

8029.579 --> 8034.42
razio

8031.3 --> 8037.42
divisions divisions

8034.42 --> 8040.3
one versus two you know so much about it

8037.42 --> 8042.159
just because of One Versus two you don't

8040.3 --> 8044.56
know anything about the exact size but

8042.159 --> 8046.98
you know it's one versus two that's your

8044.56 --> 8046.9800000000005
ratio

8049.239 --> 8055.86
and that's how all of chemistry works

8051.88 --> 8055.86
and it works extremely well

8069.099 --> 8075.04
they take that story and go and add

8072.34 --> 8077.5
there be what is the BS though then

8075.04 --> 8078.639
cartela what is the exact BS that is

8077.5 --> 8081.48
misleading

8078.639 --> 8085.719
what about atomism is literally

8081.48 --> 8089.739
misleading as in oh they're leading us

8085.719 --> 8092.5
down a wrong path that you can prove

8089.739 --> 8095.678999999999
what is it Godzilla what is so damn

8092.5 --> 8099.94
misleading about the atomic model

8095.679 --> 8105.719
besides we can't actually see it

8099.94 --> 8105.719
what else is so damn misleading about it

8112.84 --> 8118.2390000000005
used to be orbits oh so they gave it a

8115.599 --> 8120.88
name orbit well that's very cute

8118.239 --> 8124.0599999999995
so what if you just name it oh it's just

8120.88 --> 8127.36
sticking to it

8124.06 --> 8130.06
it's it's magnetically bound

8127.36 --> 8133.0199999999995
I mean can't it be in orbit if it's

8130.06 --> 8133.02
magnetically bound

8133.119 --> 8137.739
if something is gonna stay at a certain

8135.46 --> 8139.659
distance because a magnet is keeping it

8137.739 --> 8141.579
at that distance and it will then go in

8139.659 --> 8143.079
a circle around isn't that technically

8141.579 --> 8146.079
in orbit

8143.079 --> 8149.0199999999995
I mean it's not like the word is illegal

8146.079 --> 8151.719
just because it's used

8149.02 --> 8155.02
as a thing in heliocentrism I mean

8151.719 --> 8156.94
technically there are orbits

8155.02 --> 8161.02
it's just not

8156.94 --> 8163.5599999999995
a naturally occurring phenomenon

8161.02 --> 8163.56
right

8163.78 --> 8170.259999999999
you have to apply man-made devices and

8166.599 --> 8172.42
magnets and stuff to kind of show what

8170.26 --> 8174.46
that could be like what happens with it

8172.42 --> 8176.7390000000005
how an orbit can form it doesn't happen

8174.46 --> 8179.079
with the body we're standing on versus

8176.739 --> 8182.379999999999
other presupposed bodies that are out

8179.079 --> 8185.739
there yeah that orbit is horseshit and

8182.38 --> 8190.84
it's gravity grafted into it but just

8185.739 --> 8193.779999999999
like an orbit is basically a thing being

8190.84 --> 8196.719000000001
locked in with another thing and then

8193.78 --> 8197.859
moving in a circle around it because of

8196.719 --> 8200.32
a pull

8197.859 --> 8203.2
because of an equilibrium between the

8200.32 --> 8206.82
objects that still is in orbit

8203.2 --> 8206.820000000002
I mean what the hell's the problem

8206.979 --> 8211.42
there's no problem with that

8209.04 --> 8215.460000000001
orbits do exist

8211.42 --> 8215.460000000001
they're just not planetary

8221.439 --> 8226.599
you cannot create orbits with magnets

8224.019 --> 8228.78
and Fields that's absolute [ __ ] you

8226.599 --> 8228.78
can

8229.179 --> 8235.0
I can I can literally do it in front of

8232.24 --> 8238.0
your face you dumbass

8235.0 --> 8238.0
here

8238.84 --> 8242.04
take a magnet

8242.62 --> 8245.669000000002
[Music]

8246.28 --> 8249.939
yeah

8247.599 --> 8254.439
look at this this thing here

8249.939 --> 8257.380000000001
this end part here is going to orbit see

8254.439 --> 8260.019
very basic orbit

8257.38 --> 8263.018999999998
it's orbiting

8260.019 --> 8266.32
it's locked in

8263.019 --> 8268.899
yeah low yeah it is though it is exactly

8266.32 --> 8271.96
what that is it's not over a vast

8268.899 --> 8274.0
distance but it can be done over a fast

8271.96 --> 8276.88
distance

8274.0 --> 8279.7
yeah there is Magnetic Locking that

8276.88 --> 8282.279999999999
actually can be done over distance they

8279.7 --> 8286.320000000002
call it quantum locking and it is a

8282.28 --> 8289.42
magnetic effect and that's very real

8286.32 --> 8293.679
neutral or although it has to be natural

8289.42 --> 8296.139
does it now even though I just said

8293.679 --> 8299.08
that it wouldn't be natural

8296.139 --> 8301.358999999999
yeah am I saying that orbits are a

8299.08 --> 8303.16
naturally occurring phenomenon Godzilla

8301.359 --> 8305.08
am I saying that orbits are natural

8303.16 --> 8307.84
science am I

8305.08 --> 8310.019
no I wasn't so don't put me in the

8307.84 --> 8313.0
position of such a false dichotomy there

8310.019 --> 8314.019
I'm just saying that the effect of an

8313.0 --> 8316.3
orbit

8314.019 --> 8320.76
can definitely exist

8316.3 --> 8320.759999999998
it's just not planetary

8324.84 --> 8330.099
and it's definitely not gravity based

8328.54 --> 8332.219000000001
orbit

8330.099 --> 8332.219000000001
yeah

8332.5 --> 8336.719
fundamental forces could create art

8334.24 --> 8336.719
that's right

8339.7 --> 8344.2
but it's not going to be a naturally

8341.8 --> 8348.42
occurring phenomenon and it's definitely

8344.2 --> 8348.42
not going to be terrestrial orbit

8348.7 --> 8355.719000000001
it will very likely be magnetic based

8352.599 --> 8357.460000000001
magnetic orbits

8355.719 --> 8359.199999999999
there is such a thing

8357.46 --> 8362.139
and there's Quantum logging which is

8359.2 --> 8365.139000000001
also magnetic and that's all real that's

8362.139 --> 8367.119999999999
all there it's all created through

8365.139 --> 8370.119999999999
man-made devices though so it's never

8367.12 --> 8371.92
going to be scientific in that sense but

8370.12 --> 8375.04
just because something isn't scientific

8371.92 --> 8377.5
doesn't mean it doesn't exist

8375.04 --> 8380.880000000001
still there it's still happening it's

8377.5 --> 8380.88
just what are you going to claim with it

8387.12 --> 8395.04
tweak going around in the whirlpool yeah

8390.399 --> 8395.039999999999
you could consider it like that yeah

8395.62 --> 8398.399000000001
I'm a feel

8406.06 --> 8408.539999999999
yes

8409.24 --> 8412.74
oh my God

8424.26 --> 8427.74
believe that

8440.14 --> 8447.3
why don't you check out my parsley plant

8443.439 --> 8447.300000000001
is it crushing or what

8452.26 --> 8456.66
in this shoots I'm strong

8460.12 --> 8463.26
the bigger this

8483.04 --> 8485.7
okay

8487.96 --> 8491.64
yeah I'll see yeah it's doing great

8495.16 --> 8501.78
orbit must continue must it why why must

8499.24 --> 8501.78
it continue

8512.92 --> 8517.84
I'm sorry what why wouldn't orbit have

8516.16 --> 8521.819
to continue is is that part of the

8517.84 --> 8524.56
definition or is that just exclusive to

8521.819 --> 8528.0
cosmology based claims

8524.56 --> 8530.26
I'm pretty sure it's exclusively

8528.0 --> 8531.64
cosmology-based claims that say it must

8530.26 --> 8534.7
continue

8531.64 --> 8537.399
in the conception of atoms yeah but it's

8534.7 --> 8540.52
completely irrelevant in the conception

8537.399 --> 8545.26
of atoms though Godzilla

8540.52 --> 8547.54
yeah whenever with atoms micro parts of

8545.26 --> 8549.0
atoms Whenever there is considerations

8547.54 --> 8553.78
of like

8549.0 --> 8555.76
orbits and body things about it like

8553.78 --> 8559.060000000001
that's it

8555.76 --> 8561.04
a teacher will absolutely admit to you

8559.06 --> 8565.0
when they're explaining that and you ask

8561.04 --> 8568.740000000002
that it's just a concept that there's no

8565.0 --> 8568.74
proof that it is like that

8570.84 --> 8576.24
right fields are much better that's

8574.0 --> 8576.24
right

8578.94 --> 8583.18
[Music]

8580.84 --> 8585.28
yeah

8583.18 --> 8590.800000000001
your point yeah your point has been

8585.28 --> 8590.800000000001
reached except atoms are still atoms

8590.859 --> 8596.979000000001
and they do exist

8593.68 --> 8598.899
and whatever electrons do

8596.979 --> 8601.24
yeah I don't think that's a little ball

8598.899 --> 8603.42
moving at an endless field that's just a

8601.24 --> 8606.1
field that doesn't mean it doesn't exist

8603.42 --> 8608.819
it definitely doesn't mean that it's not

8606.1 --> 8608.819
an atom either

8619.439 --> 8625.74
radiation

8621.18 --> 8625.74
strip electrons from atoms

8625.859 --> 8630.960000000001
yeah

8627.819 --> 8630.96
well what about it

8634.18 --> 8638.26
it's more about tension though in that

8637.0 --> 8642.96
sense

8638.26 --> 8642.960000000001
radiation can deplete the charge

8684.3 --> 8688.72
there is no splitting of the atom though

8687.22 --> 8691.899
really

8688.72 --> 8694.42
there is just the breaking apart the

8691.899 --> 8697.92
fundamentals so that there isn't

8694.42 --> 8697.92
more left of the same

8698.08 --> 8702.78
this is like cracking the material

8713.56 --> 8720.76
it's split yeah that's just to say

8716.56 --> 8723.279999999999
splitting an atom versus like that is

8720.76 --> 8726.880000000001
really metaphorical it's not splitting

8723.28 --> 8729.52
of an atom it's just break like going

8726.88 --> 8732.46
further than just splitting material

8729.52 --> 8735.220000000001
apart into more of the same material

8732.46 --> 8737.699999999999
and then using other processes to

8735.22 --> 8737.699999999999
basically

8738.24 --> 8745.24
disintegrate or disassemble the

8742.0 --> 8748.84
components of the material into

8745.24 --> 8750.939
not the material

8748.84 --> 8754.56
so that they would split up in other

8750.939 --> 8754.56
things than the material

8758.76 --> 8762.12
s yeah but

8769.0 --> 8775.96
yeah arguably fission and fusion happens

8772.479 --> 8778.479
but there's no Chain Reaction though

8775.96 --> 8781.3
and definitely one atom does not contain

8778.479 --> 8786.24
the energy of the entire universe that

8781.3 --> 8786.24
sci-fi [ __ ] is absolute garbage

8787.0 --> 8790.479
yeah

8788.08 --> 8792.58
I mean we should absolutely see past

8790.479 --> 8794.319
that by now I used to believe in that so

8792.58 --> 8796.42
much in the 90s because it's like oh

8794.319 --> 8798.699999999999
everything contains Infinite Energy it's

8796.42 --> 8801.42
so promising yeah but it's actually

8798.7 --> 8801.42
[ __ ]

8802.3 --> 8807.399
because it's just not true

8804.46 --> 8810.279999999999
one atom does not contain the energy of

8807.399 --> 8814.5
the entire universe it was always a myth

8810.28 --> 8814.5
tied in with the atom bomb nonsense

8816.72 --> 8821.019999999999
elements don't split to new material

8819.399 --> 8822.819
yeah duh that's why they're called

8821.02 --> 8824.62
elements

8822.819 --> 8828.66
that's why they're atoms because they

8824.62 --> 8828.660000000002
don't split up in other material

8829.24 --> 8835.0
because if it splits up in other

8831.1 --> 8839.52
material then it would be a molecule

8835.0 --> 8839.52
that's why they call it a molecule

8843.1 --> 8850.26
and elements can split up but they are

8845.8 --> 8850.259999999998
not going to be splitting up in material

8850.3 --> 8858.16
we're gonna be splitting up in energy

8853.38 --> 8861.58
and electrons and components

8858.16 --> 8864.28
that are not going to be

8861.58 --> 8866.819
substantial enough to be considered

8864.28 --> 8866.819000000001
material

8885.52 --> 8888.939
all right anyway I hope you guys are

8886.96 --> 8892.06
enjoying the show I might be rounding

8888.939 --> 8894.04
out soon there's no fvd

8892.06 --> 8896.279999999999
been going for almost two and a half

8894.04 --> 8896.28
hour

8901.24 --> 8903.84
laughs

8907.479 --> 8915.479
atoms are as such no that's the entire

8910.66 --> 8915.479
point of atoms and molecules

8915.7 --> 8921.7
they are not essentially molecules

8918.04 --> 8924.460000000001
that's the whole point

8921.7 --> 8926.979000000001
if atoms are essentially molecules then

8924.46 --> 8929.919999999998
there wouldn't be a word atoms or

8926.979 --> 8932.38
molecules that just call it one thing

8929.92 --> 8936.34
they aren't essentially the same thing

8932.38 --> 8937.119999999999
they're very specifically not the same

8936.34 --> 8940.02
thing

8937.12 --> 8940.02
Godzilla

8940.3 --> 8944.5
if you'd say something like that in

8942.34 --> 8949.68
chemistry class you fail the class

8944.5 --> 8949.68
because it's specifically incorrect

8951.04 --> 8955.62
foreign

8952.41 --> 8955.619999999999
[Music]

8973.68 --> 8978.7
to smaller party yeah but what if you

8976.06 --> 8981.519999999999
actually break it down into parts that

8978.7 --> 8985.18
are other type parts that don't have the

8981.52 --> 8985.18
same property Godzilla

8985.479 --> 8989.438999999998
or you don't seem to be taking that into

8987.58 --> 8990.7
a car you seem to be thinking that you

8989.439 --> 8992.62
can just

8990.7 --> 8994.359
take smaller amounts of the same

8992.62 --> 8996.880000000001
substances it just taste the same

8994.359 --> 9000.24
success yeah but you can also break it

8996.88 --> 9002.46
up into other substances yeah that's how

9000.24 --> 9006.979
you know that it's a molecule because

9002.46 --> 9006.979
you can break it up in other substances

9009.06 --> 9016.34
that are still material that's how you

9013.08 --> 9016.34
know it's a molecule

9016.979 --> 9019.519999999999
yeah

9019.7 --> 9026.52
so you combine atoms

9023.88 --> 9029.699999999999
and they are molecules and they have

9026.52 --> 9033.78
specific molecular properties that the

9029.7 --> 9035.880000000001
singular atoms don't have on their own

9033.78 --> 9039.0
and that's how you know it's a molecule

9035.88 --> 9042.358999999999
because you can disassemble the molecule

9039.0 --> 9045.3
into other substances

9042.359 --> 9047.720000000001
that have different properties than the

9045.3 --> 9047.72
molecule

9054.19 --> 9068.52
[Music]

9064.52 --> 9068.52
right anyway

9068.7 --> 9073.62
I'm really hoping to get some support by

9071.16 --> 9075.17
the way from anybody here it's been a

9073.62 --> 9076.800000000001
while by now

9075.17 --> 9080.04
[Music]

9076.8 --> 9082.8
and I really do feel I deserve it I mean

9080.04 --> 9085.319000000001
I've been doing regular three-hour shows

9082.8 --> 9088.58
I've been having great detailed content

9085.319 --> 9088.58
a lot of focus

9091.26 --> 9093.979
foreign

9095.54 --> 9099.560000000001
if I got matching support

9100.02 --> 9106.560000000001
I mean I actually show up every day

9104.16 --> 9109.26
how about that

9106.56 --> 9111.6
right instead of

9109.26 --> 9114.6
the other person that does great work

9111.6 --> 9116.220000000001
and then just doesn't show up because of

9114.6 --> 9118.319
technical reasons

9116.22 --> 9119.938999999998
that just keep going and going and going

9118.319 --> 9123.359
forever

9119.939 --> 9125.76
oh it's all really really reasonable and

9123.359 --> 9128.220000000001
super and all that and I see you guys

9125.76 --> 9129.899
throwing money and then I'm thinking why

9128.22 --> 9132.3
the [ __ ] aren't you throwing money at me

9129.899 --> 9135.06
the guy that actually shows up every

9132.3 --> 9138.358999999999
[ __ ] day and talks about different

9135.06 --> 9142.199999999999
things every single time

9138.359 --> 9145.439
that finds compelling ideas every single

9142.2 --> 9148.640000000001
time every show why aren't you throwing

9145.439 --> 9148.64
money at me guys

9176.58 --> 9179.0
people

9180.23 --> 9185.1
[Music]

9182.52 --> 9186.899000000001
or are the people that are throwing you

9185.1 --> 9191.880000000001
just don't give a [ __ ] about anything

9186.899 --> 9195.599999999999
you just want people to grind down and

9191.88 --> 9197.819
yell and shout and prove how [ __ ]

9195.6 --> 9199.02
anti-flat earthers are is is that what

9197.819 --> 9202.439
deserves money

9199.02 --> 9205.92
is that you just want people to burn

9202.439 --> 9208.68
down obvious clowns is that the only

9205.92 --> 9211.5
thing that makes money nowadays

9208.68 --> 9215.04
and not like actually getting really

9211.5 --> 9217.319
refined complex ideas to the table every

9215.04 --> 9221.300000000001
[ __ ] day

9217.319 --> 9221.3
every day something new

9221.939 --> 9227.42
that doesn't deserve money only burning

9225.479 --> 9231.479
down obvious

9227.42 --> 9233.88
blatantly obvious clowns

9231.479 --> 9235.858999999999
is that what gets my people throwing

9233.88 --> 9238.319
money because like why aren't you

9235.859 --> 9241.319
throwing money at me why and I mean yeah

9238.319 --> 9243.6
you guys in chat you might not be rich

9241.319 --> 9246.0
or anything it's not like you're the

9243.6 --> 9248.16
only ones that even watch my show

9246.0 --> 9250.68
where's the rest why are you all

9248.16 --> 9254.3
throwing money at these other guys that

9250.68 --> 9254.300000000001
half of the time don't even show up

9257.6 --> 9264.56
foreign

9260.18 --> 9264.56
don't take it so personal please

9270.08 --> 9277.34
I can barely afford to pay attention

9272.819 --> 9277.34
okay don't worry about it

9292.26 --> 9296.58
I mean

9293.939 --> 9299.52
do I have to reactivate super chats are

9296.58 --> 9300.72
people just only going to throw super

9299.52 --> 9301.939
chats

9300.72 --> 9304.619999999999
because

9301.939 --> 9306.899
the only thing they want is just

9304.62 --> 9309.84
attention it's like yeah we don't

9306.899 --> 9312.779999999999
actually care about what the [ __ ] you're

9309.84 --> 9314.1
talking about we just want some

9312.78 --> 9316.92
billboard

9314.1 --> 9319.62
we just want to be putting something in

9316.92 --> 9322.439
your face whether it's nonsensical

9319.62 --> 9324.84
or to the point we don't even care we

9322.439 --> 9327.12
just want a billboard in your face that

9324.84 --> 9331.16
we know you're gonna read out

9327.12 --> 9331.160000000002
is that the only reason you do it

9339.54 --> 9344.28
because I get very little PayPal here

9342.319 --> 9347.76
sometimes I do

9344.28 --> 9350.7
but most of the times I absolutely don't

9347.76 --> 9353.399
as in like the last half a week

9350.7 --> 9356.479000000001
when I've done three hour shows almost

9353.399 --> 9356.479
every single time

9366.479 --> 9371.039999999999
people just like you like to be heard oh

9368.88 --> 9375.319
you really

9371.04 --> 9375.319000000001
well why did you go do a Daily Show then

9388.56 --> 9391.16
right

9408.899 --> 9411.08
foreign

9415.96 --> 9419.08
[Music]

9423.78 --> 9431.1
[Music]

9428.76 --> 9433.74
people only really start to throw money

9431.1 --> 9435.899000000001
at you when you just like do a live

9433.74 --> 9437.76
debating against somebody and [ __ ]

9435.899 --> 9440.099999999999
destroy them is that the only thing that

9437.76 --> 9442.380000000001
does it

9440.1 --> 9444.74
it's like you just don't care about

9442.38 --> 9447.3
anything you just want to see somebody

9444.74 --> 9449.28
successfully destroy bullshitters is

9447.3 --> 9450.179999999998
that like the only thing you ever care

9449.28 --> 9453.380000000001
about

9450.18 --> 9453.380000000001
I'm talking in general

9453.66 --> 9460.14
because I see people out there still

9456.84 --> 9462.899
throwing money like it's no man's

9460.14 --> 9467.599999999999
business all over the place

9462.899 --> 9467.599999999999
Super Chat all over the [ __ ] place

9482.1 --> 9486.18
I mean maybe I should just turn on the

9484.26 --> 9488.939
super chats and just say yeah [ __ ] it

9486.18 --> 9490.68
all I mean you're all very content like

9488.939 --> 9492.78
everybody that really wants to help me

9490.68 --> 9494.64
out they're so poor they can't and

9492.78 --> 9497.28
everybody else that will support me just

9494.64 --> 9499.019999999999
doesn't give a [ __ ] for real they don't

9497.28 --> 9501.18
actually care

9499.02 --> 9503.04
they just want to get in your face with

9501.18 --> 9504.66
stupid super chats and they just want

9503.04 --> 9506.34
the attention and they don't give a [ __ ]

9504.66 --> 9507.479
if you [ __ ] kill yourself the next

9506.34 --> 9509.819
day or not

9507.479 --> 9512.039999999999
maybe that's just the case

9509.819 --> 9514.279999999999
maybe people don't really want to

9512.04 --> 9514.28
support

9516.0 --> 9521.1
they just want the attention and they

9518.22 --> 9524.24
don't give a [ __ ] about anything else

9521.1 --> 9524.24
maybe that's the case

9532.3 --> 9535.599999999999
[Music]

9537.54 --> 9543.0
yeah so maybe it's just that it's like

9540.24 --> 9545.28
Oh no you're just you just want to throw

9543.0 --> 9547.26
money at Google

9545.28 --> 9551.16
oh because then you get attention and

9547.26 --> 9555.12
then you send the Super Chat it takes 45

9551.16 --> 9558.359
away from me and the other 55 I have to

9555.12 --> 9560.34
pay back so they literally never get a

9558.359 --> 9563.640000000001
cent out of it ever

9560.34 --> 9565.68
yeah that's how fun your [ __ ] super

money to Google and you get nothing

9573.72 --> 9580.819
Arwin oh I love it so much

link no that never ever means that

9634.14 --> 9640.68
nobody ever wanted that ever

9637.68 --> 9640.68
ridiculous

9641.34 --> 9647.52
when you copy something you highlighted

9644.76 --> 9652.380000000001
you don't want to copy

9647.52 --> 9656.04
the the background code of the page you

9652.38 --> 9659.24
want to copy the link always

9656.04 --> 9659.240000000002
[ __ ] [ __ ]

9660.66 --> 9665.819

it's a warm sunny

9687.899 --> 9693.72
bit Breezy but not cold

9691.319 --> 9696.859
it's really lovely I should get out

9693.72 --> 9696.858999999999
after the show

9699.72 --> 9705.579
hmm

9702.5 --> 9705.579
[Music]

9716.54 --> 9721.04
yes I appreciate that Godzilla

9721.859 --> 9727.7
and I know that you have supported me

9723.899 --> 9727.699999999999
but you also pissed me off

9728.04 --> 9731.84
it's not the first time you've done that

9741.0 --> 9743.54
right

9745.62 --> 9751.5
I don't know maybe I just really need to

9748.8 --> 9753.66
like advertise myself more and really

9751.5 --> 9755.58
get out there to get other new people

9753.66 --> 9757.56
that are just like oh there's something

9755.58 --> 9759.41
new I like it I'm gonna throw money at

9757.56 --> 9762.469
it

9759.41 --> 9762.469
[Music]

9762.6 --> 9765.56
I don't know

9765.84 --> 9771.960000000001
I mean I like collecting loyal people

9769.46 --> 9774.358999999999
even though they're poor

9771.96 --> 9777.96
it would just be cool to get like get

9774.359 --> 9780.06
some rich new blood in there and

9777.96 --> 9782.339999999998
and then hope that they don't actually

9780.06 --> 9783.66
become poor I mean I'm [ __ ] sick of

9782.34 --> 9786.18
that too like

9783.66 --> 9789.18
I really hope that just following me

9786.18 --> 9791.42
doesn't somehow make you lose jobs and

9789.18 --> 9791.42
[ __ ]

9791.46 --> 9795.14
that would be [ __ ] horrendous

9802.58 --> 9810.14
except silly I don't know what that is

9806.06 --> 9810.14
venmo don't know what that is either

9842.88 --> 9846.74
what what do you mean Supreme knowing

9853.2 --> 9856.1
I don't get it

9861.3 --> 9863.84
foreign

9883.04 --> 9888.560000000001
I don't think we're going to be using

9885.359 --> 9888.56
wheelbarrows of cash

9894.0 --> 9899.64
I mean there's not gonna be

9898.14 --> 9903.38
cash

9899.64 --> 9903.38
in order to wheelbarrow

9935.58 --> 9939.3
yeah yeah more colored I mean it's not

9937.8 --> 9941.039999999999
the first time something like that has

9939.3 --> 9943.438999999998
happened though it's like oh buy silver

9941.04 --> 9946.080000000002
and gold and that's I do what I

9943.439 --> 9948.359
recognize like recommend that I have

9946.08 --> 9950.1
done that myself when I still had some

9948.359 --> 9952.800000000001
money

9950.1 --> 9954.899000000001
so yeah it's over gold it's the best way

9952.8 --> 9958.199999999999
to get through a crash but what usually

9954.899 --> 9961.858999999999
happens after it actually crashes

9958.2 --> 9964.439
yeah yeah it really does actually happen

9961.859 --> 9967.140000000001
that governments go out and confiscate

9964.439 --> 9969.479000000001
silver and gold then

9967.14 --> 9972.24
so you gotta take that into account as

9969.479 --> 9974.34
well like yeah I got out of the crash

9972.24 --> 9977.399
yeah guess but they are actually still

9974.34 --> 9979.2
gonna then come for you and just take it

9977.399 --> 9982.76
that's what happens this is what

9979.2 --> 9982.76
happened in the United States

9983.88 --> 9987.72
so

9985.56 --> 9992.06
I mean it's pretty cool to have gold and

9987.72 --> 9992.06
guns but unless you can hide it

9992.16 --> 9997.439
or protect it

9995.28 --> 9999.6
it's not really gonna do you much good

9997.439 --> 10001.939
it's just gonna be confiscated after it

9999.6 --> 10005.319
became really valuable or people will

10001.939 --> 10005.319
literally just rob you

10006.979 --> 10015.438999999998
how is my crypto investment going

10009.859 --> 10019.220000000001
fine it's still I mean it is it is like

10015.439 --> 10021.68
producing its stuff and I am investing

10019.22 --> 10024.8
and it's growing I mean my account is

10021.68 --> 10028.220000000001
really is really like exploding it has

10024.8 --> 10030.38
been for quite a while it's doing great

10028.22 --> 10035.14
but I mean yeah

10030.38 --> 10035.14
I still don't have any usdt

10036.26 --> 10041.479
nobody got into that with me I mean

10038.96 --> 10043.519999999999
everybody's like oh I might borrow it I

10041.479 --> 10045.5
might lend it to you or no no I don't

10043.52 --> 10047.960000000001
lend it to you because it's a scam and

10045.5 --> 10050.06
they're like oh well great well yeah

10047.96 --> 10051.56
that was a complete [ __ ] waste of

10050.06 --> 10054.56
time

10051.56 --> 10056.72
so I'm still in the same position

10054.56 --> 10060.56
that's it it's just still the same

10056.72 --> 10063.619999999999
position I could really use like up to a

10060.56 --> 10066.019999999999
thousand dollars worth of usdt tether

10063.62 --> 10068.84
type

10066.02 --> 10071.18
and then it would take me two years to

10068.84 --> 10074.54
literally get it back

10071.18 --> 10076.399
to double that amount

10074.54 --> 10079.399000000001
and then

10076.399 --> 10080.72
give it back if somebody wanted to lend

10079.399 --> 10082.939
it to me

10080.72 --> 10084.92
and then use the remaining stuff to

10082.939 --> 10086.54
basically keep doing it again and

10084.92 --> 10089.3
transform

10086.54 --> 10092.2
of the GTI based tokens

10089.3 --> 10092.199999999999
over time

10094.28 --> 10099.16
why do people think it's a scam because

10096.319 --> 10099.16
they

10100.46 --> 10105.16
because they call everything a scam

10105.38 --> 10109.88
except the thing that they want to

10107.18 --> 10111.02
invest into that's not a scam you know

10109.88 --> 10114.679999999998
it's

10111.02 --> 10116.960000000001
it's mostly like oh it's something else

10114.68 --> 10118.76
that's not mine so I'm gonna attack it

10116.96 --> 10121.519999999999
because I'll Attack everything that

10118.76 --> 10124.479
isn't mine that's usually what that is

10121.52 --> 10124.479000000001
what piece now

10125.0 --> 10131.56
and I mean when you search for it on the

10127.76 --> 10134.66
internet there's all these [ __ ] pages

10131.56 --> 10137.779999999999
whiny Grapplers that that are all sick

10134.66 --> 10140.84
oh such a scam and this is a scam and

10137.78 --> 10142.939
they never actually have any recorded

10140.84 --> 10145.34
proof that it is a scam but everybody

10142.939 --> 10146.42
endlessly likes to talk about how it's a

10145.34 --> 10150.56
scam though

10146.42 --> 10153.64
including in like news articles so yeah

10150.56 --> 10153.64
they did that

10153.979 --> 10160.76
and so again I can definitely find

10156.74 --> 10163.899
nonsense articles on how it's a scam

10160.76 --> 10163.899
that's out there

10174.5 --> 10179.72
we can disagree um yeah Godzilla that's

10177.319 --> 10182.42
fine I'll just tell you when you're

10179.72 --> 10184.279999999999
wrong and when you're not wrong

10182.42 --> 10186.68
and you can think that we have

10184.28 --> 10188.66
disagreements there that's fine you can

10186.68 --> 10190.1
you can think of it as you like I'm just

10188.66 --> 10191.66
gonna tell you when you're wrong and

10190.1 --> 10194.78
when you're not wrong

10191.66 --> 10196.64
and why and I'll keep doing that as I

10194.78 --> 10198.439
always have

10196.64 --> 10201.08
and you can think you have a different

10198.439 --> 10204.880000000001
opinion or you could just

10201.08 --> 10204.88
get to the point and learn

10205.52 --> 10210.26
you will do the same yeah and you can

10207.859 --> 10212.42
you can definitely point out the things

10210.26 --> 10215.24
that I've admitted are true like hey we

10212.42 --> 10217.88
can't actually see an atom yeah but it

10215.24 --> 10220.64
definitely exists because of inference

10217.88 --> 10221.539999999999
and because of the like everything we've

10220.64 --> 10223.699999999999
done

10221.54 --> 10225.5
with the conception and the Practical

10223.7 --> 10229.460000000001
results that have run

10225.5 --> 10232.1
out of that model utilizing the the

10229.46 --> 10235.938999999998
substance as that model look at what it

10232.1 --> 10240.74
yielded and the Perfection of that

10235.939 --> 10241.939
that has never been achieved before

10240.74 --> 10245.359
yeah

10241.939 --> 10248.24
it's the most refined model ever to roll

10245.359 --> 10250.84
out of science pretty much

10248.24 --> 10250.84
or

10251.12 --> 10254.5
preliminary science

10256.22 --> 10260.479
it's not real it's not a cause and

10258.62 --> 10263.54
effect relationship thing it's more like

10260.479 --> 10266.619999999999
what is and how big is it

10263.54 --> 10266.62
and how does it work

10267.76 --> 10271.6
so anyway

10271.88 --> 10276.319
yeah almost at the three hours I'm gonna

10274.58 --> 10278.84
round out

10276.319 --> 10280.819
