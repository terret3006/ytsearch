119.52 --> 125.479
would be great right the weather today

122.28 --> 125.479
is uh

125.82 --> 130.92
I guess this is closer to like the Mist

128.819 --> 133.85999999999999
that they forecast

130.92 --> 136.379
was supposed to happen a day ago

133.86 --> 140.54000000000002
this is kind of misty-ish this morning

136.379 --> 140.54
but it's already kind of clearing up

141.06 --> 146.4
it's a bit cloudy up there

143.94 --> 148.68
but it's not thick clouds or anything so

146.4 --> 151.68
there's still some sun coming through it

148.68 --> 151.68
occasionally

153.959 --> 159.48
it's very little wind still

157.5 --> 162.86
and yeah it does seem like there's just

159.48 --> 162.85999999999999
more moist in the air

163.379 --> 168.599
so it's just seems a little colder

166.62 --> 170.34
probably isn't much colder than it was

168.599 --> 172.879
yesterday

170.34 --> 172.879
right

174.72 --> 179.599
hello James Mays first in chat good to

177.239 --> 179.59900000000002
see you man

180.0 --> 186.78
it is Thursday the 16th of February 2023

187.7 --> 193.44
[Music]

189.5 --> 195.86
temperature is nine oh nine ten degrees

193.44 --> 195.85999999999999
Celsius

197.84 --> 204.0
it's saying like it also

200.76 --> 206.84
would rain here apparently I have seen a

204.0 --> 206.84
little bit of moist

208.68 --> 212.34
so it might have rained just a little

210.239 --> 214.14000000000001
earlier but I haven't seen it rained

212.34 --> 216.599
thus far

214.14 --> 218.04
I don't know if it's going to rain some

216.599 --> 220.01899999999998
more but yeah according to the forecast

218.04 --> 224.599
it's going to be more cloudy and more

220.019 --> 224.59900000000002
rainy in the coming week we'll see

225.599 --> 230.599
hello Supreme knowing good to see you

237.42 --> 246.5
right so I had a really good night rest

241.58 --> 246.5
I I oh it got up a bit late so

248.78 --> 254.159
roughly and a half hour before the show

251.939 --> 257.519
started when I woke up but I think it

254.159 --> 259.979
still meant to be relatively on time

257.519 --> 262.56
man but I had some intense dreams and I

259.979 --> 265.919
did kind of like call for that too

262.56 --> 268.08
I took extra fish oil and a dosage of

265.919 --> 271.08
iodine yesterday night

268.08 --> 275.419
right before going to sleep

271.08 --> 275.419
and I did get like a lot of Dreams

280.199 --> 285.41900000000004
and it's so funny because every time I

282.479 --> 287.88
like I get more dreams it's all social

285.419 --> 291.08
action interface inter social

287.88 --> 291.08
interaction based

291.96 --> 297.96
it's just me focusing on that and on

295.1 --> 300.47900000000004
doing that what it's like it's almost

297.96 --> 303.84
like I'm subconsciously training myself

300.479 --> 306.78
for face-to-face situations or something

303.84 --> 311.21999999999997
because I I don't interact a lot face to

306.78 --> 314.88
face compared to say 10 years ago

311.22 --> 316.91900000000004
when I was I didn't do this I didn't

314.88 --> 318.84
have my interaction with the internet

316.919 --> 321.53999999999996
like this

318.84 --> 326.039
before I started the YouTube channel

321.54 --> 329.82
here I I didn't do that much at all

326.039 --> 331.8
and my so social media interactions were

329.82 --> 334.09999999999997
really kind of in the background most of

331.8 --> 334.1
the time

334.5 --> 340.759
nervous even to being widely known well

337.979 --> 340.75899999999996
that stopped

341.759 --> 345.78000000000003
anyway

342.96 --> 348.23999999999995
hello tiger bear

345.78 --> 351.79999999999995
discern the Eucharist

348.24 --> 351.8
this journey okay

372.6 --> 377.18
all right

374.639 --> 377.18
okay

388.08 --> 392.75899999999996
unless there's something that you were

390.12 --> 394.139
Discerning the Eucharist about tiger

392.759 --> 396.18
bear I mean

394.139 --> 399.02
I'll talk about it

396.18 --> 399.02
perhaps

399.72 --> 402.96000000000004
I was kind of a blank slate for today's

401.819 --> 406.88
show

402.96 --> 406.88
that's why it doesn't have a title yet

411.0 --> 416.06
if you guys want to talk about something

412.86 --> 416.06
then I'll talk about it

421.139 --> 426.78000000000003
all right well I'll see

424.5 --> 429.06
I mean time I'll talk about what I was

426.78 --> 432.05999999999995
doing yesterday

429.06 --> 434.28000000000003
Flat Earth debates

432.06 --> 437.819
was pretty good

434.28 --> 439.67999999999995
I got into a bit of a issue with QE in

437.819 --> 442.74
the after show

439.68 --> 444.96
was just yelling at me while I tried to

442.74 --> 447.599
give it a technical

444.96 --> 448.38
update to Nathan about the show and all

447.599 --> 451.08
that

448.38 --> 453.9
but after that I mean the show the after

451.08 --> 455.88
show was pretty good

453.9 --> 457.13899999999995
also I noticed that yesterday during the

455.88 --> 459.919
live flight of debate I was pretty

457.139 --> 459.919
hyperactive

460.08 --> 464.84
and seems like Nathan didn't mind

465.3 --> 470.90000000000003
because other days when I'm like that

467.099 --> 474.53999999999996
everybody's like is shut up Arwin

470.9 --> 476.099
what didn't happen yesterday so

474.54 --> 479.53900000000004
[Music]

476.099 --> 479.539
but that was a fun show

481.8 --> 486.8
it's in favor lady is just so nutty

487.259 --> 494.52000000000004
like she really delved into like what it

491.759 --> 498.44
feels like psychotic grounds like

494.52 --> 498.44
crazy things that she says

500.639 --> 506.22
I wonder if she is fully cognitive about

504.18 --> 508.74
what she's rolling out if she's like

506.22 --> 510.56
purposely rolling out some Wizardry or

508.74 --> 513.419
if he's actual if that actually

510.56 --> 515.64
spontaneously happens like that and she

513.419 --> 516.899
doesn't know and everybody just leaves

515.64 --> 519.12
it

516.899 --> 521.099
I don't know

519.12 --> 523.86
not sure with her

521.099 --> 525.48
but she's rolling out some really crazy

523.86 --> 528.5600000000001
things

525.48 --> 528.5600000000001
in her videos

528.899 --> 533.48
she would have seen if you watched Flat

530.7 --> 533.48
Earth debates yesterday

534.32 --> 541.519
navigating by sight

537.779 --> 541.519
you need to see me what

546.6 --> 550.339
what do you mean you need to see it

554.399 --> 562.459
you mean you need to see the ritual

558.0 --> 562.459
because it is a ritual right in church

562.92 --> 567.0
sort of

564.66 --> 571.16
like with the

567.0 --> 571.16
bread and water or the little

571.44 --> 578.5400000000001
thingy whatever you call that

574.68 --> 578.54
but at the moments they use bread

580.08 --> 585.12
they just take some bread and bless it

583.26 --> 588.8
like little pieces and then everybody

585.12 --> 588.8
just takes a piece from a basket

591.6 --> 594.2
what

595.82 --> 600.899
what are you talking about

599.22 --> 604.7
what does the Horizon have to do with

600.899 --> 604.7
the Eucharist that you're confusing me

615.08 --> 619.5600000000001
yeah

617.06 --> 621.8389999999999
okay maybe you're trying to be creative

619.56 --> 626.06
or something but

621.839 --> 626.0600000000001
those two are not related

628.92 --> 632.459
we tried to get metaphorical or

630.72 --> 635.1800000000001
something but I mean it's

632.459 --> 635.18
no point

638.13 --> 642.159
[Music]

646.459 --> 649.8199999999999
tiger bear

654.0 --> 657.029
[Music]

657.779 --> 660.92
you're not helping

672.839 --> 676.8000000000001
right I have been following Owen

674.76 --> 678.8389999999999
Benjamin by the way he's been very

676.8 --> 680.519
interesting but yeah usually in the

678.839 --> 682.8000000000001
middle of the week I have some issues

680.519 --> 684.92
catching up and then I catch up in the

682.8 --> 684.92
weekend

688.14 --> 693.26
I'm now at the

690.12 --> 693.26
Tuesday episode

699.3 --> 702.3
foreign

713.39 --> 716.419
[Music]

731.339 --> 734.36
what are you doing

746.76 --> 751.8
guys Supreme knowing James maze is this

749.7 --> 754.74
just me of this tiger Barrel acting

751.8 --> 758.3
really weird cause I can't make any

754.74 --> 758.3
sense of what he's saying right now

760.33 --> 763.519
[Music]

765.72 --> 768.44
okay

769.26 --> 771.98
foreign

774.26 --> 781.24
[Music]

785.36 --> 788.72
right whatever

793.139 --> 798.0
right but yeah I mean Owen Benjamin also

795.899 --> 800.76
revealed

798.0 --> 803.579
that was really bad I didn't know was

800.76 --> 806.3389999999999
that bad but in in that show the Tuesday

803.579 --> 810.779
show he reveals that basically

806.339 --> 813.1800000000001
some top guy in the Orthodox Church

810.779 --> 815.459
basically promoting

813.18 --> 817.62
the medical experimentation like even

815.459 --> 819.4799999999999
saying like you you're you can't get a

817.62 --> 821.779
religious exemption from us that was

819.48 --> 825.899
really super egregious I mean that was

821.779 --> 828.36
bad that was bad bad

825.899 --> 830.839
didn't know it was that bad

828.36 --> 830.839
like

838.079 --> 843.06
that was disappointing

840.74 --> 846.6800000000001
all right so I'm really curious where

843.06 --> 846.68
this whole thing is going to maneuver to

851.22 --> 854.899
right but yeah

855.36 --> 859.98
you can't say that the Orthodox Church

857.76 --> 862.88
is completely pure blood

859.98 --> 862.88
in this sense

863.16 --> 867.139
they wouldn't be after something like

864.959 --> 867.1389999999999
that

884.519 --> 890.4590000000001
all right

885.72 --> 892.62
any feedback on my show yesterday

890.459 --> 893.8199999999999
or the just the title

892.62 --> 898.32
all right

893.82 --> 901.4590000000001
UV Invasion or occult spy Tech

898.32 --> 901.4590000000001

902.459 --> 905.959
a classical homeopath

908.39 --> 915.13
[Music]

916.32 --> 920.1
really

917.87 --> 922.32
[Music]

920.1 --> 924.36
even in alternative medical community

922.32 --> 925.8000000000001
why

924.36 --> 929.24
I mean

925.8 --> 929.24
that's terrible

932.54 --> 936.51
[Music]

943.26 --> 948.919
[Music]

950.399 --> 954.48
oh Supreme no you didn't know that

952.86 --> 958.5600000000001
Eucharist at the heart of Christian

954.48 --> 961.8000000000001
worship well it's like they're they all

958.56 --> 963.6899999999999
agree upon that at least

961.8 --> 966.899
right for some reason

963.69 --> 966.899
[Music]

971.76 --> 975.92
I think the Eucharist is really weird

976.26 --> 983.279
and I personally think that yeah it's

979.44 --> 986.339
it's really tough to tell because

983.279 --> 988.4399999999999
like as a remembrance ritual I've

986.339 --> 990.5400000000001
partaken in it right with with the

988.44 --> 993.48
Mormon Church even and it's like yeah I

990.54 --> 998.699
mean it's I like to remember Christ

993.48 --> 999.72
but I choose how to remember Christ when

998.699 --> 1002.18
I do it

999.72 --> 1004.519
I'm not going to be like oh he died for

1002.18 --> 1006.56
our sins and now we're free like I I

1004.519 --> 1011.199
don't care about that stuff I literally

1006.56 --> 1011.199
do not believe it never really did

1011.48 --> 1017.54
I only choose to believe it at times

1014.54 --> 1019.399
where I was just feeling so [ __ ] bad

1017.54 --> 1023.4399999999999
that I'm like okay I'll just believe

1019.399 --> 1023.44
anything maybe it'll help like that

1023.779 --> 1029.799
and in a way yeah I would feel I would

1026.9 --> 1029.799
get out of it

1030.5 --> 1034.4
but I mean that's that's kind of

1032.66 --> 1038.179
circumstantial

1034.4 --> 1040.459
and I think that just remembering Christ

1038.179 --> 1043.4
like thinking about Christ what he was

1040.459 --> 1045.559
doing I think that that is to me that is

1043.4 --> 1048.26
the real Eucharist

1045.559 --> 1050.0
not that oh you have to use flush and

1048.26 --> 1054.3799999999999
drink his blood and

1050.0 --> 1056.29
and he's God and all that like that is

1054.38 --> 1059.5400000000002
crazy to me

1056.29 --> 1059.54
[Music]

1066.5 --> 1071.12
but I think even according to the the

1069.14 --> 1071.95
last meal and or the Last Supper what

1071.12 --> 1074.36
was it

1071.95 --> 1076.82
[Music]

1074.36 --> 1078.6789999999999
he just told people like do this to

1076.82 --> 1082.82
remember me

1078.679 --> 1085.76
he didn't like lay down what was going

1082.82 --> 1088.76
to happen it that should be remembered

1085.76 --> 1089.84
like Remember My Sacrifice every time he

1088.76 --> 1093.2
eat that

1089.84 --> 1095.98
right he wasn't he wasn't right or am I

1093.2 --> 1095.98
incorrect with this

1097.16 --> 1103.7
so I it always comes down to every time

1100.34 --> 1105.3799999999999
and this is like continual continue with

1103.7 --> 1108.559
all these freaking churches and all

1105.38 --> 1112.16
these Bible interpreters

1108.559 --> 1113.96
I just tend to look at exactly what

1112.16 --> 1115.94
Christ is saying

1113.96 --> 1120.08
and then keep it

1115.94 --> 1122.179
to the context of him then and what he

1120.08 --> 1124.6599999999999
was thinking and why and what he was

1122.179 --> 1124.66
trying to

1125.12 --> 1132.1399999999999
basically initiate like an echo effect

1128.419 --> 1134.66
and it's just what people conclude out

1132.14 --> 1136.94
there with their churches like it has

1134.66 --> 1141.02
nothing to do when what he was talking

1136.94 --> 1143.179
about like so many times it's like all

1141.02 --> 1146.0
these churches are just there to

1143.179 --> 1149.679
perpetuate misinterpretations

1146.0 --> 1149.679
that's what it's like to me

1151.16 --> 1154.9
and it's everywhere there is

1158.9 --> 1161.5590000000002
yeah

1161.66 --> 1165.919
I've never come across a single

1163.76 --> 1168.62
exception

1165.919 --> 1170.8400000000001
and it's all just like oh are you

1168.62 --> 1173.36
interested in our misinterpretation or

1170.84 --> 1176.24
Christ no no no don't listen to that guy

1173.36 --> 1178.6999999999998
are you this and that'll happen right no

1176.24 --> 1181.58
you have to follow our misinterpretation

1178.7 --> 1184.22
of Christ that's the right way right

1181.58 --> 1187.6
that's what it's that's literally how I

1184.22 --> 1187.6000000000001
hear it foreign

1189.2 --> 1194.299
do this in remembrance of me oh I I did

1191.6 --> 1199.8999999999999
remember it correct right

1194.299 --> 1204.32
so I I just do what he says

1199.9 --> 1205.8200000000002
I try to and and when I'm not doing it

1204.32 --> 1207.559
I'm like

1205.82 --> 1210.3999999999999
really

1207.559 --> 1210.3999999999999
feeling it

1210.5 --> 1216.32
and I'm not gonna make excuses as to

1213.679 --> 1220.64
like oh oh I oh I'm feeling upset

1216.32 --> 1222.26
because I misunderstand it and I have to

1220.64 --> 1225.919
think about it like this and then it's

1222.26 --> 1228.62
okay like no I just don't do that

1225.919 --> 1230.8400000000001
right and in that sense I'm still a

1228.62 --> 1233.0
little conflicted and I would like to

1230.84 --> 1234.9189999999999
elaborate a lot and it still hasn't

1233.0 --> 1236.299
happened about

1234.919 --> 1239.539
Christ

1236.299 --> 1242.299
not liking to eat meat I need to know

1239.539 --> 1245.0
more and I don't give a [ __ ] about

1242.299 --> 1247.8799999999999
Paul's reinterpretation of that

1245.0 --> 1250.52
I want to know what Christ was

1247.88 --> 1252.38
what he was about with that what he had

1250.52 --> 1254.84
to say I bet he had to say a whole bunch

1252.38 --> 1258.74
of things might be in the in one of the

1254.84 --> 1261.559
non-canon books perhaps

1258.74 --> 1265.1
right because I'm just really interested

1261.559 --> 1267.26
as to the why

1265.1 --> 1269.539
he had objection

1267.26 --> 1272.299
was it because

1269.539 --> 1275.36
he couldn't eat it because it would

1272.299 --> 1278.4189999999999
disrupt his spiritual State I've heard

1275.36 --> 1281.24
about it before in the past from

1278.419 --> 1283.4
non-christians okay

1281.24 --> 1285.679
it's like yeah if you eat meat

1283.4 --> 1287.539
it's like good for regeneration but it

1285.679 --> 1289.5800000000002
also like Cuts you off from the highest

1287.539 --> 1292.78
frequency that's something I heard I

1289.58 --> 1292.78
never had any

1292.94 --> 1298.3400000000001
really deep Reflections on it because

1295.52 --> 1300.3799999999999
for some reason I don't feel like I

1298.34 --> 1302.6589999999999
experienced it that much I've never had

1300.38 --> 1305.6000000000001
like oh I've eaten meat now I'm gonna

1302.659 --> 1309.2
get cut off it's only when I like

1305.6 --> 1311.6
really indulged in meat and only as a

1309.2 --> 1314.179
little kid I still used to do that but

1311.6 --> 1316.34
after like my 20s I kind of stopped

1314.179 --> 1318.38
doing that because I started to notice

1316.34 --> 1320.6
like yeah if you just eat a whole lot of

1318.38 --> 1323.0590000000002
meat like you eat a meal and it's 45

1320.6 --> 1326.6
meat

1323.059 --> 1329.12
then it does seem to almost like

1326.6 --> 1332.1789999999999
suppress something higher senses some

1329.12 --> 1336.86
higher sense it it has

1332.179 --> 1338.9
but since I just eat meat never never

1336.86 --> 1340.28
too much it's always very modest with

1338.9 --> 1343.7800000000002
the meat really

1340.28 --> 1343.78
and then I don't have that at all

1345.26 --> 1349.82
so I really wonder was that

1347.659 --> 1352.7
about

1349.82 --> 1356.059
was he talking about that was Jesus

1352.7 --> 1357.8600000000001
Reverend like no meat is for

1356.059 --> 1360.3799999999999
I didn't even know what he said about it

1357.86 --> 1362.539
like whether you're like an animal or

1360.38 --> 1364.2800000000002
you're a lower being or whatever he

1362.539 --> 1366.62
would have said about people that eat

1364.28 --> 1368.6589999999999
meat I don't know if he said anything or

1366.62 --> 1372.82
he just only said no I don't want to eat

1368.659 --> 1372.8200000000002
that it's bad for me I don't know

1375.74 --> 1381.6200000000001
yeah gospels were written

1378.62 --> 1385.039
that's true but the apostles

1381.62 --> 1388.7199999999998
had written about his life which was

1385.039 --> 1388.72
during his him being alive

1390.02 --> 1397.48
Maxwell's metal slugs Masters right

1394.7 --> 1399.799
so there's still some

1397.48 --> 1402.2
trustworthiness to it but yeah there's

1399.799 --> 1404.84
been the problem

1402.2 --> 1407.059
the afterward problem is there's left

1404.84 --> 1409.8799999999999
Works left out and there's Works

1407.059 --> 1412.28
inserted

1409.88 --> 1414.8600000000001
written by people that weren't there

1412.28 --> 1417.86
when he was alive that is the problem

1414.86 --> 1420.02
but there's a lot of written work by

1417.86 --> 1421.6999999999998
people that literally were with him when

1420.02 --> 1424.72
it happened

1421.7 --> 1424.72
when he was there

1426.679 --> 1430.3400000000001
but

1428.0 --> 1433.419
I'm just in wonderment a bit right now

1430.34 --> 1433.4189999999999
stumble into it

1436.039 --> 1441.62
why

1437.78 --> 1444.5
did he bring it up was it because he was

1441.62 --> 1448.34
basically trying to communicate like

1444.5 --> 1450.5
look being really close to God

1448.34 --> 1453.4399999999998
yes

1450.5 --> 1454.28
having basically Miracle power you could

1453.44 --> 1457.7
say

1454.28 --> 1459.3799999999999
or to a certain degree and I can testify

1457.7 --> 1461.24
to that

1459.38 --> 1463.4
in in my own way

1461.24 --> 1465.799
that if you eat meat

1463.4 --> 1467.24
as they would have probably like oh you

1465.799 --> 1469.28
kill an animal yeah you kill the whole

1467.24 --> 1472.34
animal you eat the whole animal right

1469.28 --> 1475.58
especially if this is in warmer climates

1472.34 --> 1479.0
they did not exactly have like efficient

1475.58 --> 1480.559
refrigerators or anything or maybe some

1479.0 --> 1482.9
storage methods

1480.559 --> 1485.0
but if there was meat probably people

1482.9 --> 1487.039
would all stuff themselves with it or it

1485.0 --> 1489.679
would go rotten quickly

1487.039 --> 1491.059
and been Infested by by flies and all

1489.679 --> 1493.5800000000002
that [ __ ] right

1491.059 --> 1495.6789999999999
so because of that it would be logical

1493.58 --> 1497.84
that if meat was on the menu on a

1495.679 --> 1500.0
regular basis that people would then

1497.84 --> 1502.52
stuff themselves and have the higher

1500.0 --> 1506.08
spiritual thing cut off and so was he

1502.52 --> 1506.08
warning about that

1506.9 --> 1514.2800000000002
because that seems very logical to me

1511.7 --> 1516.82
or

1514.28 --> 1519.6789999999999
is it

1516.82 --> 1522.02
more tied into Priestly way of thinking

1519.679 --> 1525.02
is it really about no you shouldn't did

1522.02 --> 1529.6399999999999
he really mean no if you eat meat you'll

1525.02 --> 1529.6399999999999
not wreak heaven right although

1531.14 --> 1534.94
is that really what he would have meant

1540.5 --> 1545.38
it's yeah I'm still not certain about

1543.08 --> 1545.3799999999999
this

1548.659 --> 1551.2600000000002
not have liked it

1554.299 --> 1558.32
liked it that's weird I personally

1556.279 --> 1560.6
really haven't ever met anybody that

1558.32 --> 1564.58
didn't like the taste of me

1560.6 --> 1564.58
they just didn't want to eat it

1566.36 --> 1570.6999999999998
well certain Meats might not taste good

1574.039 --> 1579.32
but I've never met anybody that's like

1576.679 --> 1580.3400000000001
yeah well when I was a kid and my

1579.32 --> 1582.3799999999999
parents

1580.34 --> 1585.02
fed me meat I couldn't eat it it was

1582.38 --> 1588.64
disgusting like I've never heard of such

1585.02 --> 1588.6399999999999
a story ever never

1591.2 --> 1597.799
it would always be some kind of moral

1593.419 --> 1599.659
objection or idealism that would or

1597.799 --> 1601.8799999999999
being raised in a family where they

1599.659 --> 1604.0
simply were vegetarian or vegan or

1601.88 --> 1604.0
whatever

1604.4 --> 1609.44
but mostly idealism that would make

1606.74 --> 1611.1200000000001
people stop eating meat then that's what

1609.44 --> 1613.279
I've seen out here

1611.12 --> 1615.32
that's it I've never met anybody that

1613.279 --> 1618.32
was like oh man I don't eat meat because

1615.32 --> 1621.1399999999999
it's disgusting I've never heard anybody

1618.32 --> 1623.96
say that except for oh it's disgusting

1621.14 --> 1626.0
because it's it's a living being I don't

1623.96 --> 1628.279
want to be like that right so it's more

1626.0 --> 1631.279
about emotions I've never heard anybody

1628.279 --> 1633.02
that actually said like yeah meet ew I

1631.279 --> 1635.059
hate the taste it's so disgusting never

1633.02 --> 1638.1399999999999
heard anybody say that ever

1635.059 --> 1638.1399999999999
ever not once

1639.2 --> 1642.799
except

1640.46 --> 1645.159
as a joke or something like I'm saying

1642.799 --> 1645.1589999999999
right now

1645.5 --> 1647.98
right

1648.02 --> 1653.5
so I don't think that that would make

1650.419 --> 1653.5
little sense to me

1655.94 --> 1659.72
but if Jesus was trying to warn people

1658.1 --> 1661.52
like hey if you don't want to get caught

1659.72 --> 1662.419
off from the higher spiritual senses

1661.52 --> 1664.8799999999999
which

1662.419 --> 1666.98
I'm constantly engaging with

1664.88 --> 1669.679
then don't stuff yourself with me

1666.98 --> 1671.48
because that seems like a pragmatic

1669.679 --> 1673.76
piece of advice

1671.48 --> 1676.299
you see

1673.76 --> 1676.299
foreign

1679.22 --> 1683.14
you don't like the taste of me turret

1685.34 --> 1687.9399999999998
really

1698.84 --> 1704.48
okay fine I guess there's people out

1701.9 --> 1705.679
there that do not tag like the taste

1704.48 --> 1707.72
that I've never

1705.679 --> 1711.159
met anybody

1707.72 --> 1711.159
like that face to face

1712.159 --> 1717.5590000000002
pure vegetarian like okay right okay

1715.52 --> 1719.779
yeah well it makes sense then tear it

1717.559 --> 1722.24
because then you are like literally

1719.779 --> 1725.5
raised like that and then it's gonna

1722.24 --> 1725.5
taste very off

1740.12 --> 1742.7199999999998
right

1748.4 --> 1754.5800000000002
yeah because vegetarians that I was

1752.24 --> 1757.1
or that have been raised vegetarians and

1754.58 --> 1758.96
all that and I've met a couple over the

1757.1 --> 1761.0
years that don't remember their names

1758.96 --> 1763.7
it's just people that I hung around with

1761.0 --> 1766.52
and they happen to be that and

1763.7 --> 1768.5
we'd never talk about eating meat

1766.52 --> 1770.36
so I never asked them like how do you

1768.5 --> 1773.74
think it tastes I never asked them I

1770.36 --> 1773.74
thought that might be offensive

1775.46 --> 1780.08
so you're the first vegetarian to tell

1777.62 --> 1782.1999999999998
me that you also don't like the taste of

1780.08 --> 1782.1999999999998
it

1788.96 --> 1791.98
butter chicken

1801.62 --> 1808.539
right I like butter chicken

1804.559 --> 1808.539
that's how I make my chicken

1808.7 --> 1813.6200000000001
in butter

1810.38 --> 1816.46
that's how I fry it slow fry it

1813.62 --> 1816.4599999999998
it's amazing

1821.96 --> 1829.419
there's lots of pepper and salt and

1826.279 --> 1829.419
I have Rosemary

1831.26 --> 1833.74
anyway

1836.84 --> 1842.02
you dislike the smell of fish yeah but I

1839.899 --> 1842.02
mean

1842.179 --> 1846.74
fish is pretty gross smelling especially

1844.76 --> 1848.899
well if it's really fresh it's not that

1846.74 --> 1851.0
bad but as soon as it's like slightly

1848.899 --> 1852.26
not Super Fresh anymore it starts to

1851.0 --> 1854.299
really reek

1852.26 --> 1856.34
so Tara that I think that even people

1854.299 --> 1858.52
that like eating fish would agree to

1856.34 --> 1858.52
that

1861.2 --> 1865.82
I don't like eating fish by the way but

1863.36 --> 1868.6
I do take fish oil but yes I do not like

1865.82 --> 1868.6
the smell of fish

1869.539 --> 1874.1
uh

1871.039 --> 1877.96
and I don't like the taste either really

1874.1 --> 1877.9599999999998
but it's really healthy for me though

1878.419 --> 1883.88
so just take the oil anyway

1880.71 --> 1883.88
[Music]

1887.059 --> 1894.5
okay tour Casey yeah I never

1890.96 --> 1896.559
I I do not like shellfish never did I

1894.5 --> 1899.12
was really freaked out by that always

1896.559 --> 1903.2
I've seen my parents eat it where I

1899.12 --> 1905.36
would literally just not eat because I

1903.2 --> 1907.94
was so grossed out that I could just I

1905.36 --> 1910.1589999999999
was just waiting for everybody to stop

1907.94 --> 1911.6000000000001
I've actually fled the table because I

1910.159 --> 1915.94
was so grossed out

1911.6 --> 1915.9399999999998
with my family eating like crabs

1917.179 --> 1922.5800000000002
but that's if it's like really the

1919.88 --> 1924.8600000000001
animal like as is that's just so [ __ ]

1922.58 --> 1926.36
gross to me it's it's really really

1924.86 --> 1930.1999999999998
gross to me

1926.36 --> 1932.24
but I do like group book which is

1930.2 --> 1933.44
basically like grounded up shellfish

1932.24 --> 1938.059
chips

1933.44 --> 1940.279
I do really like those occasionally

1938.059 --> 1942.82
and every time I eat it I kind of Wonder

1940.279 --> 1942.82
it's like

1942.86 --> 1949.039
is this bad

1944.899 --> 1952.76
or was Christ really warning about well

1949.039 --> 1955.22
not really processed shellfish but just

1952.76 --> 1958.1
like the shellfish from the sea maybe

1955.22 --> 1961.279
they were toxic because there was

1958.1 --> 1962.84
waste dumped in the ocean like from gold

1961.279 --> 1964.88
mining which there would be a lot of

1962.84 --> 1966.799
mercury waste maybe that was dumped well

1964.88 --> 1968.8400000000001
that would get in the shellfish and

1966.799 --> 1971.0
would make them really bad to eat maybe

1968.84 --> 1974.299
he was worrying about that

1971.0 --> 1976.7
or maybe there was a typical parasite

1974.299 --> 1980.24
situation going on which happens with

1976.7 --> 1983.919
some Wildlife ocean life too

1980.24 --> 1983.919
it was like yeah don't eat it because

1984.2 --> 1991.1000000000001
like you'll get those parasites

1987.74 --> 1992.24
was he warning about that or again was

1991.1 --> 1995.6589999999999
it

1992.24 --> 1998.419
a spiritual thing as in spiritual

1995.659 --> 2000.7
functioning or even Priestly

1998.419 --> 2002.8600000000001
interpretation like in relation to the

2000.7 --> 2004.3600000000001
rules of God that would allow you in

2002.86 --> 2005.57
heaven or not

2004.36 --> 2006.9399999999998
I don't know

2005.57 --> 2009.6399999999999
[Music]

2006.94 --> 2012.159
but I wonder sometimes and I don't like

2009.64 --> 2014.44
oh yeah man I need my daily crab chips

2012.159 --> 2016.659
no no

2014.44 --> 2019.44
and the more I think about it the less I

2016.659 --> 2019.44
actually want them

2021.519 --> 2027.46
but they do

2023.62 --> 2029.9399999999998
seem to be kind of nurturing to me when

2027.46 --> 2029.94
I eat it

2030.7 --> 2034.2
it does make me feel good

2041.44 --> 2047.8600000000001
yuck

2043.6 --> 2050.8199999999997
no I don't like crap I just crab chips

2047.86 --> 2053.379
crab chips like there's nothing

2050.82 --> 2057.28
identifiably crap about that except

2053.379 --> 2060.52
maybe just that distinct smell

2057.28 --> 2062.98
and it doesn't even smell super fishy

2060.52 --> 2065.379
I guess it depends on like what type of

2062.98 --> 2067.48
crab chips how it was fabricated but the

2065.379 --> 2070.419
ones that are there are organic crab

2067.48 --> 2073.54
shifts okay in the store

2070.419 --> 2075.339
and I really like those

2073.54 --> 2077.8
this is just a little expensive

2075.339 --> 2080.5
unfortunately there's like four Euros

2077.8 --> 2083.32
and they wait three but still that's

2080.5 --> 2085.899
like for kind of little bag like yeah I

2083.32 --> 2088.659
don't do that too often anymore because

2085.899 --> 2091.679
that's expensive

2088.659 --> 2091.679
but it was great

2091.78 --> 2097.32
especially like with a beer but yeah

2094.419 --> 2097.3199999999997
don't drink that anymore

2100.14 --> 2107.2599999999998
paste or red dye ew

2104.68 --> 2110.7599999999998
caution you really

2107.26 --> 2110.76
that's so disgusting

2111.4 --> 2117.099
that that red dye right that's usually

2114.4 --> 2120.88
used that's caution you I don't know how

2117.099 --> 2125.04
you pronounce it in English but that's

2120.88 --> 2125.04
literally like a a lice

2125.2 --> 2129.3999999999996
that's grounded up because of its

2127.72 --> 2132.5989999999997
extreme red color

2129.4 --> 2135.2200000000003
that's that's like

2132.599 --> 2138.28
parasitical bugs

2135.22 --> 2140.9199999999996
that are being grounded up for the color

2138.28 --> 2144.579
and there is like it's known to have

2140.92 --> 2147.82
some weird alert allergic responses

2144.579 --> 2149.8590000000004
like I have alert I have minor allergic

2147.82 --> 2154.3
responses to it like it it kind of makes

2149.859 --> 2158.0989999999997
me weird it [ __ ] with my nervous system

2154.3 --> 2158.099
I figured that out in my youth

2160.3 --> 2163.8590000000004
and yes it is an insect

2165.339 --> 2172.2
but it's known it's known for that it's

2168.04 --> 2172.2
known to be relatively toxic

2172.96 --> 2178.32
it's in like the E list right the

2175.66 --> 2178.3199999999997
e-number list

2178.48 --> 2182.339
because you know is right in there

2183.16 --> 2189.3999999999996
when you learned that like 15 years ago

2186.76 --> 2192.0400000000004
like I really learned it but even my

2189.4 --> 2196.7200000000003
parents were concerned with that that

2192.04 --> 2199.8
and as a kid they made sure that was

2196.72 --> 2199.7999999999997
avoided in the food

2202.96 --> 2205.38
oh

2205.66 --> 2208.2599999999998
foreign

2213.88 --> 2219.1600000000003
do you enjoy your food more or more

2217.3 --> 2221.76
before or after

2219.16 --> 2221.7599999999998
what

2224.859 --> 2227.88
I'd say after

2230.2 --> 2235.5989999999997
right when it gets in my system then I

2233.44 --> 2237.339
really feel nourished and that that sets

2235.599 --> 2239.619
in very quickly

2237.339 --> 2242.56
so yeah I actually do enjoy the food

2239.619 --> 2244.3
more after I've eaten it

2242.56 --> 2247.0
I mean

2244.3 --> 2248.92
when I was younger I would really enjoy

2247.0 --> 2252.22
eating

2248.92 --> 2255.339
but yeah my teeth are not what they used

2252.22 --> 2257.7999999999997
to be so eating is a little bit of a

2255.339 --> 2260.7999999999997
chore these days and so

2257.8 --> 2262.96
it's not as like oh yeah let's Chow it

2260.8 --> 2264.6400000000003
down and I could just oh gosh in the

2262.96 --> 2267.88
taster that it doesn't work like that

2264.64 --> 2269.859
and I can't eat like that anymore it's

2267.88 --> 2274.359
physically impossible I would have to

2269.859 --> 2276.88
like have some serious dental work done

2274.359 --> 2281.46
which would would guarantee to be

2276.88 --> 2281.46
running into the thousands of euros

2281.98 --> 2287.26
and I don't exactly I I didn't plan to

2285.22 --> 2288.52
do anything like that even if I could

2287.26 --> 2292.1800000000003
afford it

2288.52 --> 2295.5
so to me yeah after I've eaten it that

2292.18 --> 2295.5
is the best time for me

2298.06 --> 2301.38
give Pizza fish

2301.78 --> 2304.5
okay

2320.92 --> 2324.839
I don't know about all that

2330.54 --> 2337.119
rotted fish you mean fermented

2334.18 --> 2338.98
sequence that rotted that that seems

2337.119 --> 2340.54
kind of unlikely because that would

2338.98 --> 2342.88
literally be

2340.54 --> 2346.0
overtly toxic

2342.88 --> 2348.1600000000003
but if it is fermented that could make

2346.0 --> 2351.0
sense

2348.16 --> 2351.0
foreign

2359.579 --> 2365.26
I've heard of the word the filter fish

2362.74 --> 2366.74
but I have no idea what it is never even

2365.26 --> 2369.7900000000004
seen that before so

2366.74 --> 2369.79
[Music]

2372.47 --> 2375.66
[Music]

2375.94 --> 2378.42
anyway

2397.72 --> 2403.3799999999997
in Jewish food yeah

2400.42 --> 2403.38
probably yeah

2405.22 --> 2411.359
that's where I even get to hear about

2407.079 --> 2414.7000000000003
the word it's through like these

2411.359 --> 2416.859
Jewish related cartoons and all that and

2414.7 --> 2420.72
they bring it up I think there's like

2416.859 --> 2420.72
Family Guy brought it up one time

2421.72 --> 2426.0
or was it South Park I don't remember

2437.38 --> 2442.56
okay

2439.119 --> 2442.56
it's not fermented okay

2443.079 --> 2448.26
do I have to plan do I plant it I have a

2446.02 --> 2448.2599999999998
family

2448.42 --> 2455.7400000000002
well plan is a big word but I do

2452.98 --> 2458.7
intend to have one

2455.74 --> 2458.7
at some point

2459.28 --> 2463.6600000000003
but I mean

2461.38 --> 2465.28
just like it is right now here in the

2463.66 --> 2468.3999999999996
Netherlands

2465.28 --> 2470.38
if I do that there would be a very big

2468.4 --> 2472.96
chance I would literally not be able to

2470.38 --> 2474.46
get control over what happens to my

2472.96 --> 2478.0
children

2474.46 --> 2479.9700000000003
and they would probably be rolled into

2478.0 --> 2481.78
the [ __ ] out there

2479.97 --> 2484.7799999999997
[Music]

2481.78 --> 2484.78
so

2491.02 --> 2499.3
I am effectively waiting until the

2495.82 --> 2500.26
just the Demonic madness has finally

2499.3 --> 2503.02
been

2500.26 --> 2504.94
taken out of the schools again

2503.02 --> 2508.119
right

2504.94 --> 2511.7400000000002
because I do not want my children

2508.119 --> 2515.1400000000003
especially at a young age to ever ever

2511.74 --> 2517.06
be subjected the climate change

2515.14 --> 2518.98
programming

2517.06 --> 2521.7999999999997
if any sort

2518.98 --> 2526.2400000000002
I do not want them to face

2521.8 --> 2529.3
like gender confusion nonsense ever

2526.24 --> 2532.18
I mean hey if they're like socializing

2529.3 --> 2535.7200000000003
and they they get to hear about it like

2532.18 --> 2538.96
when they're 16 or something or 15

2535.72 --> 2543.339
then I'd be like yeah fine whatever

2538.96 --> 2547.2400000000002
but I do not want them to ever ever hear

2543.339 --> 2549.7
about it one single time

2547.24 --> 2552.64
in their pre-teens

2549.7 --> 2556.24
never under any circumstances right

2552.64 --> 2559.02
that's really difficult out here

2556.24 --> 2559.02
I think

2560.32 --> 2563.04
right

2563.38 --> 2568.359
and yeah I mean

2566.14 --> 2572.64
I'm kind of poor

2568.359 --> 2572.64
that's not a good thing out here

2574.599 --> 2579.7000000000003
as a father that's just not good it's

2577.42 --> 2583.359
not good for morale either

2579.7 --> 2587.2
so I'd have to first have more stable

2583.359 --> 2590.14
income situations I really do

2587.2 --> 2593.02
hey I tried it with this but it doesn't

2590.14 --> 2596.6189999999997
seem to really work I mean it works well

2593.02 --> 2600.64
enough to keep me relatively stable at

2596.619 --> 2603.359
times Financial at times okay

2600.64 --> 2603.359
but

2603.819 --> 2610.619
I mean I'm not gonna I don't make a

2606.76 --> 2610.619
profit here I don't

2616.359 --> 2621.88
I mean as soon as I I get donations and

2619.78 --> 2624.46
income through you guys

2621.88 --> 2628.06
enough to actually supersede my social

2624.46 --> 2631.06
welfare then I could actually start to

2628.06 --> 2633.16
think about like hey

2631.06 --> 2635.74
maybe I could like move to a better

2633.16 --> 2638.7999999999997
place and

2635.74 --> 2642.2999999999997
maybe try to get a family going or at

2638.8 --> 2642.3
least like start dating again

2643.78 --> 2648.76
because that's just not happening the

2645.64 --> 2651.52
way things are going right now

2648.76 --> 2652.8
they're not happening just for this

2651.52 --> 2655.359
simple

2652.8 --> 2658.96
psychological reason is that I don't

2655.359 --> 2663.0
want to face a girl and then being poor

2658.96 --> 2663.0
I don't want to be that

2663.579 --> 2666.54
I just don't

2673.19 --> 2677.319
[Music]

2675.22 --> 2679.9199999999996
remember here is the prophet yeah good

2677.319 --> 2679.92
luck with that

2683.02 --> 2685.98
okay

2687.5 --> 2694.48
[Music]

2713.44 --> 2720.819
all right if if I were to give my child

2717.28 --> 2723.0400000000004
at least one child or maybe more

2720.819 --> 2725.38
like the same kind of opportunity as

2723.04 --> 2726.819
that I had to actually develop my

2725.38 --> 2732.579
faculties

2726.819 --> 2733.54
then I cannot be poor it I cannot afford

2732.579 --> 2737.26
that

2733.54 --> 2740.02
or I would in a certain way guaranteed

2737.26 --> 2742.3590000000004
to fail as a as a parent

2740.02 --> 2745.06
to

2742.359 --> 2747.96
to bring my children's intellects to

2745.06 --> 2747.96
their full potential

2755.079 --> 2761.1600000000003
well maybe yeah maybe that's not true I

2757.48 --> 2761.16
don't know it's just that I

2761.56 --> 2767.5
I don't want to like run short and like

2764.02 --> 2769.54
basically be forced to go to the

2767.5 --> 2771.52
government more for support because

2769.54 --> 2773.619
that's what I'm already I'm I'm right

2771.52 --> 2776.079
there right now you do realize that I'm

2773.619 --> 2778.9
still on social welfare yeah I'm still

2776.079 --> 2781.599
dependent on them oh let's also oh I'm

2778.9 --> 2783.52
dependent let's make more people that

2781.599 --> 2786.52
are also going to be dependent I'm sure

2783.52 --> 2789.52
they're gonna be really thankful they're

2786.52 --> 2792.4
not gonna try to [ __ ] around with me

2789.52 --> 2794.319
maybe for some jabbies and that kind of

2792.4 --> 2796.359
[ __ ] right yeah I'm sure they're not

2794.319 --> 2798.7599999999998
gonna do it they'll love it when a guy

2796.359 --> 2800.92
that's already dependent on the

2798.76 --> 2804.46
government to get around they're gonna

2800.92 --> 2806.619
make a family of people that are also

2804.46 --> 2810.3
going to be dependent I'm sure they're

2806.619 --> 2810.3
gonna love it yeah

2914.22 --> 2920.7

2916.9 --> 2920.7000000000003

2920.98 --> 2924.76
because that's an attitude of an

2923.319 --> 2927.4
American

2924.76 --> 2929.6800000000003
I'd say I mean in America yeah that

2927.4 --> 2933.04
works to a certain yeah that works like

2929.68 --> 2936.3999999999996
that this is the Netherlands

2933.04 --> 2938.74
and England yeah guess what it doesn't

2936.4 --> 2941.859
work like that there

2938.74 --> 2945.04

2950.74 --> 2956.74
if you're not wealthy enough government

2953.619 --> 2960.339
will literally like through their little

2956.74 --> 2963.339
weirdo rules try to take control over

2960.339 --> 2965.38
your children away from you that's what

2963.339 --> 2968.68
they do here

2965.38 --> 2972.94
in the Netherlands and England

2968.68 --> 2975.339
if you're not wealthy enough that's what

2972.94 --> 2978.2200000000003
they do yeah

2975.339 --> 2981.2799999999997
so it's really cool tiger bear that

2978.22 --> 2983.319
you'd love to consider children as well

2981.28 --> 2984.88
that's the real wealth in the family as

2983.319 --> 2988.72
the world yeah yeah guess what yeah

2984.88 --> 2990.96
government steals that wealth here you

2988.72 --> 2990.9599999999996
understand

2992.74 --> 2997.5989999999997
if you're not actually physically have

2996.28 --> 3002.1600000000003
money

2997.599 --> 3006.38
then they will try to take that wealth

3002.16 --> 3009.5789999999997
that family well from you

star water do

3026.28 --> 3031.38
I can actually say this with great

3028.98 --> 3034.38
confidence and that if I'd had money I'd

3031.38 --> 3037.5
have women all over me

3034.38 --> 3040.44
women out there do like me

3037.5 --> 3043.26
but they can also see that I'm obviously

3040.44 --> 3046.38
not wealthy since I'm going around in

3043.26 --> 3049.44
what our very weathered clothing

3046.38 --> 3052.02
it's very visible my jacket is like

3049.44 --> 3055.44
very weathered my shoes are

3052.02 --> 3057.3
almost not choose anymore

3055.44 --> 3059.88
there's no clothing that I have that

3057.3 --> 3062.96
doesn't have holes in it

3059.88 --> 3062.96
and they can see that

3063.54 --> 3068.46
they don't need is really rich man oh

3065.819 --> 3070.98
hey hey yeah I'm sure that all they all

3068.46 --> 3074.04
love to have like sex or something or

3070.98 --> 3076.14
have me do something one time there's no

3074.04 --> 3078.3
[ __ ] way that any of those would

3076.14 --> 3079.0789999999997
actually want some kind of family with

3078.3 --> 3081.54
me

3079.079 --> 3084.3
they just find me attractive they want

3081.54 --> 3086.64
me as a side snack or something yeah

3084.3 --> 3087.3590000000004
that's what's happening I know what that

3086.64 --> 3089.64
is

3087.359 --> 3091.2
and in the past when I did actually have

3089.64 --> 3093.359
money yeah

3091.2 --> 3095.3999999999996
I did score

3093.359 --> 3098.46
plenty

3095.4 --> 3101.2200000000003
I had times where I could I was so I was

3098.46 --> 3103.5
very confident I just would buy people

3101.22 --> 3106.02
drinks and their women would literally

3103.5 --> 3108.059
like multiple would line up

3106.02 --> 3109.859
okay

3108.059 --> 3114.079
didn't always wasn't always super

3109.859 --> 3114.0789999999997
interested because I'm extremely picky

3116.28 --> 3123.5
yes you can start but it's true

3119.48 --> 3123.5
these Dutch women man

3124.26 --> 3128.1800000000003
a lot of them are just

3130.02 --> 3133.579
they're spoiled and

3141.599 --> 3145.98
there's very little women that really do

3144.059 --> 3147.7200000000003
want a family here that's the big

3145.98 --> 3149.16
difference I think that that's a really

3147.72 --> 3152.839
big difference

3149.16 --> 3152.839
compared to the United States

3158.16 --> 3162.1189999999997
it's like it's pretty tough here

3159.96 --> 3163.619
sometimes to find a woman that actually

3162.119 --> 3165.0
wants a family

3163.619 --> 3167.099
in general

3165.0 --> 3170.16
although you could argue well if they

3167.099 --> 3172.1400000000003
bumped into the ultimate Superman Alpha

3170.16 --> 3174.96
guy that's really perfect then they'll

3172.14 --> 3176.7
just suddenly want a family

3174.96 --> 3179.059
yeah

3176.7 --> 3179.0589999999997

3223.859 --> 3230.46
sold the house I had some money for a

3230.46 --> 3236.04
I've always been terrible with money

3234.359 --> 3239.46

3241.74 --> 3246.7799999999997
ever

3243.839 --> 3248.88

3246.78 --> 3251.579
my teens because I knew like I am going

3248.88 --> 3253.92
to [ __ ] fail societally

3251.579 --> 3257.819
if I don't figure this out

3253.92 --> 3261.119
and guess what I didn't figure it out

3257.819 --> 3264.74

what a decent income would be to start a

I don't know why you don't just post the

3456.42 --> 3460.339
I mean you do have a wrench

3462.24 --> 3468.8999999999996
I guess I'll do it for you then

3465.18 --> 3471.3799999999997
here's tarot 306 this video that he just

3468.9 --> 3471.38

[Music]

3495.059 --> 3499.7400000000002
all right but anyway look all this talk

3497.819 --> 3501.0589999999997
oh just started from we just do this and

3499.74 --> 3504.839
that yeah

3501.059 --> 3508.6800000000003
look if I'm gonna meet my future wife at

3504.839 --> 3512.16
some point or grow into that or whatever

3508.68 --> 3514.9199999999996
then after that point we'll see because

3512.16 --> 3516.8999999999996
as soon as I get into a relationship I

3514.92 --> 3519.059
literally transform into another

3516.9 --> 3522.42
personality anyway

3519.059 --> 3526.099
which works very differently

3522.42 --> 3526.099
uh has another dynamic

3527.64 --> 3533.64
and depending on who my girlfriend would

3530.16 --> 3536.0589999999997
be I'd have a more data available even

3533.64 --> 3536.0589999999997
to me

3537.599 --> 3542.2200000000003
right

3539.059 --> 3544.5
so yeah I mean once you get into a

3542.22 --> 3547.02
relationship then you can much easier

3544.5 --> 3548.78
tell whether you could actually start a

3547.02 --> 3552.119
family with that

3548.78 --> 3554.3390000000004
right if you don't even have a

3552.119 --> 3557.099
girlfriend then like how can you even

3554.339 --> 3558.9
figure it out because it really does

3557.099 --> 3561.2000000000003
depend on who you're in a relationship

3558.9 --> 3561.2000000000003
with

3570.48 --> 3573.44
no

3577.5 --> 3580.5
uh

3585.359 --> 3590.4
all the parts needed for combustion yeah

3587.88 --> 3593.94
that's super cute be this dentist super

3590.4 --> 3597.42
cute yeah but I mean what is is it

3593.94 --> 3599.4
pressing upon to make it move yeah

3597.42 --> 3603.0
combustion

3599.4 --> 3606.42
gas expansion a control explosion which

3603.0 --> 3608.28
is basically pressure pressing right

3606.42 --> 3610.44
creating propulsing what's it pressing

3608.28 --> 3613.079
on

3610.44 --> 3615.299
now what's your rocket when it goes out

3613.079 --> 3618.319
there in space

3615.299 --> 3621.72
if it wants to push

3618.319 --> 3623.7599999999998
itself to move through the combustion

3621.72 --> 3626.7599999999998
what is it pushing on in order to

3623.76 --> 3630.3190000000004
actually get it moving

3626.76 --> 3630.3190000000004
out there how does that work

3633.0 --> 3636.14
it is dentist

3645.18 --> 3649.16
not pushing on anything

3650.22 --> 3653.72
but then it's not gonna move

3654.599 --> 3659.48
if it's just pushing on nothing it's not

3656.94 --> 3659.48
going to move

3666.359 --> 3674.339
right have you ever tried to jump

3670.619 --> 3676.92
from the surface

3674.339 --> 3678.96
of a pool

3676.92 --> 3682.92
oh it doesn't work oh you're gonna fall

3678.96 --> 3686.7
right through it or whatever yeah

3682.92 --> 3689.54
because when you displace yourself what

3686.7 --> 3689.54
happens is you

3690.839 --> 3697.92
push you push at something

3695.22 --> 3700.2799999999997
and then it displaces yeah just like a

3697.92 --> 3700.28
rocket

3700.559 --> 3706.5
well if there's nothing to push against

3703.079 --> 3709.28
or it's going to move with you then you

3706.5 --> 3709.28
don't displace

3710.88 --> 3717.96
it's just gonna vent off stuff wildly

3714.68 --> 3720.1189999999997
it's not gonna make the object displace

3717.96 --> 3724.14
because it it's not pushing against

3720.119 --> 3726.839
anything it's just venting off gas

3724.14 --> 3728.7599999999998
doesn't matter how much of it comes out

3726.839 --> 3730.319
at the same time it's just venting off

3728.76 --> 3733.559
because there's nothing to push against

3730.319 --> 3736.2599999999998
it's not going to displace a rocket in a

3733.559 --> 3737.8190000000004
vacuum will not displace itself

3736.26 --> 3741.599
because it's not pushing against

3737.819 --> 3744.18
anything it's just venting off

3741.599 --> 3745.799
well the the the combusted exhaustion

3744.18 --> 3747.1189999999997
that's all

3745.799 --> 3751.02
it's not pushing against anything

3747.119 --> 3754.44
Rockets here on Earth work why because

3751.02 --> 3756.599
there's pressure there's gas pressure to

3754.44 --> 3759.119
push

3756.599 --> 3761.7000000000003
you can push with the rocket here

3759.119 --> 3764.1600000000003
because there's local pressure which

3761.7 --> 3766.799
actually is

3764.16 --> 3770.8799999999997
even mid-air something to push against

3766.799 --> 3772.619
for the rocket to start moving yeah in a

3770.88 --> 3774.1800000000003
vacuum that doesn't work there's nothing

3772.619 --> 3777.48
to push against it's not going to

3774.18 --> 3780.98
displace itself just by it venting off

3777.48 --> 3780.98
combusted gases

3783.92 --> 3789.14
hello Nature Boy by the way Orinoco

3786.72 --> 3789.14
bumble

3793.559 --> 3795.559
okay

3799.68 --> 3802.98
you didn't know you can push against air

3801.66 --> 3806.04
to move

3802.98 --> 3808.14
yeah you can but it only works because

3806.04 --> 3811.859
that gas

3808.14 --> 3814.859
is also within a container so a rocket

3811.859 --> 3816.29
is indirectly pushing on the container

3814.859 --> 3817.5
wall

3816.29 --> 3823.2599999999998
[Music]

3817.5 --> 3825.839
with the gas that it's exerting right

3823.26 --> 3827.76
it's indirectly pushing on the container

3825.839 --> 3828.72
hole that's what allows it to actually

3827.76 --> 3831.42
move

3828.72 --> 3834.0
there was no container wall then the gas

3831.42 --> 3835.44
would maybe press against some other gas

3834.0 --> 3837.9
that would press against something else

3835.44 --> 3839.52
and then there would be no container so

3837.9 --> 3841.079
that means it all literally all just

3839.52 --> 3843.92
[ __ ] off

3841.079 --> 3843.92
all of it

3844.44 --> 3847.559
and then there's nothing to press

3845.76 --> 3849.8590000000004
against so

3847.559 --> 3853.7400000000002
Rockets

3849.859 --> 3855.54
within the Earth realm only work and can

3853.74 --> 3858.18
Propel themselves because they are

3855.54 --> 3860.48
indirectly pushing against the container

3858.18 --> 3860.48
wall

3861.54 --> 3865.859
its gas pressures against the most

3863.7 --> 3867.8999999999996
direct gas surrounding it that presses

3865.859 --> 3870.299
against the gas surrounding it that

3867.9 --> 3873.54
against it that against every other

3870.299 --> 3876.799
piece of gas everywhere which presses

3873.54 --> 3876.799
against the container wall

3883.68 --> 3887.7599999999998
fan on a roller yeah but fans or

3885.96 --> 3890.819
propellers work different though because

3887.76 --> 3893.46
propellers literally create local air

3890.819 --> 3895.92
pressure differential to create pressure

3893.46 --> 3897.299
behind it and a vacuum in front of it

3895.92 --> 3899.4
and then

3897.299 --> 3901.319
the local air pressure differential

3899.4 --> 3903.599
which is being artificially kept in this

3901.319 --> 3907.88
equilibrium will Propel It Forward

3903.599 --> 3907.88
literally Propel it right

3911.76 --> 3916.619
that's not a combustion combustion

3913.74 --> 3919.04
literally creates gas where there wasn't

3916.619 --> 3919.04
before

3919.44 --> 3925.02
a propeller just creates an air pressure

3922.619 --> 3927.42
differential in a certain setup which

3925.02 --> 3930.48
causes the this equilibrium of that air

3927.42 --> 3932.96
pressure to propel it forward

3930.48 --> 3932.96
anyway

3937.579 --> 3944.42
the Rockets slow down the higher they go

3940.68 --> 3944.4199999999996
because the pressure is less no

3945.18 --> 3949.2
well it depends on the design of a

3947.579 --> 3952.26
rocket but rockets that are supposed to

3949.2 --> 3953.7599999999998
be super high altitude they build

3952.26 --> 3955.7990000000004
momentum

3953.76 --> 3958.3190000000004
before they go there and then they are

3955.799 --> 3960.119
carried by the momentum

3958.319 --> 3962.04
right so I think that there's one

3960.119 --> 3964.38
missile technique for long distance

3962.04 --> 3966.839
missiles where they basically

3964.38 --> 3968.819
shoot it out of the earth they say it

3966.839 --> 3970.2
like this they presented heliocentric

3968.819 --> 3972.54
white they shoot it out of the

3970.2 --> 3974.52
atmosphere and then it becomes basically

3972.54 --> 3977.339
like a giant bullet

3974.52 --> 3979.92
for a while that just goes Its pathway

3977.339 --> 3982.859
as pre-calculated

3979.92 --> 3985.099
it's not propelling it's just using its

3982.859 --> 3987.96
momentum and then as soon as it

3985.099 --> 3991.079
re-enters the atmosphere the rocket goes

3987.96 --> 3994.52
back on and then it can set speed again

3991.079 --> 3994.52
that's how they use those

3994.559 --> 3999.8390000000004
so there's still momentum if it has

3996.78 --> 4002.119
momentum it will retain that momentum

3999.839 --> 4003.68
even more so in a lower pressure right

4002.119 --> 4005.96
because there's nowhere there's less air

4003.68 --> 4008.4199999999996
friction so whatever momentum it can

4005.96 --> 4013.579
build before

4008.42 --> 4017.38
getting out of the thicker air pressure

4013.579 --> 4017.38
you can still use that momentum

4032.48 --> 4036.28
what are you talking about Howard

4036.38 --> 4040.059
you're saying makes no sense to me

4042.5 --> 4046.52
why do airplanes fly so high when

4044.9 --> 4049.819
there's more air

4046.52 --> 4054.14
to push against lower down

4049.819 --> 4057.5589999999997
well because air friction that's a

4054.14 --> 4060.98
combination of reasons well Series right

4057.559 --> 4064.1600000000003
yeah there's more air to keep themselves

4060.98 --> 4066.92
afloat but that air right there's the

4064.16 --> 4069.64
point is transport right it has to move

4066.92 --> 4074.299
through it well guess what air friction

4069.64 --> 4076.819
is a real slowing down Factor

4074.299 --> 4079.7
so it has to actually make more effort

4076.819 --> 4080.7799999999997
to go through thick air than through

4079.7 --> 4082.7
thin air

4080.78 --> 4085.52
in thin air

4082.7 --> 4087.2599999999998
there's less friction it can get a

4085.52 --> 4090.2
higher speed

4087.26 --> 4092.6600000000003
with less turbulence which would be like

4090.2 --> 4097.719
the shakiness on the plane

4092.66 --> 4100.839
so with less energy it can go faster

4097.719 --> 4100.839
higher up

4102.739 --> 4109.3589999999995
right because that lift

4106.1 --> 4112.819
yeah that's less but if you go faster

4109.359 --> 4115.160000000001
then there will be more air friction it

4112.819 --> 4116.660000000001
will effectively get that lift again so

4115.16 --> 4120.58
it's

4116.66 --> 4120.58
It's a combination of reasons

4122.779 --> 4128.96
this aerodynamics it's a pretty it's a

4126.199 --> 4133.0599999999995
relatively complicated field

4128.96 --> 4133.06
of research even so

4135.859 --> 4141.219
combustion pushes in all directions does

4138.859 --> 4141.219
it not

4144.44 --> 4147.379999999999
well yeah it depends on how it's

4146.239 --> 4149.0
directed

4147.38 --> 4151.88
I mean

4149.0 --> 4154.12
a rocket specifically pushes in One

4151.88 --> 4154.12
Direction

4155.12 --> 4159.92
I mean if it's just open combustion yeah

4157.46 --> 4164.199
it's going to go in all directions sure

4159.92 --> 4164.1990000000005
but you can still direct the flow

4169.04 --> 4172.96
that's the whole point of a rocket

4170.779 --> 4172.96
engine

4173.12 --> 4177.5
and from taking it from uncontrolled

4175.58 --> 4180.46
combustion to controlled combustion

4177.5 --> 4180.46
directional

4198.64 --> 4203.6
okay what was Rhys look

4201.56 --> 4205.280000000001
I'm not good at maths either but you

4203.6 --> 4208.1
don't really need to know Mass to

4205.28 --> 4210.139999999999
understand how it works

4208.1 --> 4212.54
it's just like oh there's less air to

4210.14 --> 4214.820000000001
keep it afloat well

4212.54 --> 4218.36
oh well if you have problem keeping

4214.82 --> 4219.739
afloat just go faster oh yeah but if you

4218.36 --> 4222.739
go faster

4219.739 --> 4225.379999999999
costs more fuel why well because there's

4222.739 --> 4228.379999999999
more air friction

4225.38 --> 4231.7390000000005
it's more counter push so it's it's just

4228.38 --> 4234.38
a simple combination oh so you go higher

4231.739 --> 4237.678999999999
up you have less air friction

4234.38 --> 4239.3
you can go faster and can keep afloat

4237.679 --> 4242.36
easier

4239.3 --> 4247.719
it'll actually cause less fuel in the

4242.36 --> 4247.719
end to go faster the same distance

4256.28 --> 4263.12
[Music]

4260.6 --> 4265.159000000001
yeah I know how that works

4263.12 --> 4267.88
but it doesn't work if there's nothing

4265.159 --> 4267.879999999999
to push against

4269.06 --> 4275.4800000000005
there's no container wall to indirectly

4272.179 --> 4278.4800000000005
push against and there's no gas to push

4275.48 --> 4281.239
against because it will be all going in

4278.48 --> 4286.718999999999
all directions away

4281.239 --> 4286.718999999999
not leaving any footing to push against

4288.679 --> 4293.9
right so yeah you can initially have a

4291.679 --> 4295.82
nozzle that'll cause a directed pressure

4293.9 --> 4298.339999999999
but that's still going to press against

4295.82 --> 4300.199
the gas that surrounds it that is going

4298.34 --> 4302.360000000001
to press against the container so it

4300.199 --> 4304.699
yeah you can

4302.36 --> 4307.159
spin all around it as much as you like

4304.699 --> 4308.12
but without a container a rocket could

4307.159 --> 4311.299999999999
not

4308.12 --> 4314.98
Propel itself it would just wildly vent

4311.3 --> 4314.9800000000005
the gas in all directions

4316.4 --> 4321.759999999999
it couldn't build momentum because

4318.56 --> 4321.76
there's nothing to push against

4354.62 --> 4358.4
they don't fly as efficient what are you

4357.26 --> 4360.8
talking about

4358.4 --> 4364.639999999999
metal slugs master

4360.8 --> 4367.1
those jumbo jets are super efficient

4364.64 --> 4369.14
they bear they use vacuum engines they

4367.1 --> 4373.42
barely take any fuel

4369.14 --> 4373.42
they're very efficient

4376.82 --> 4380.739
what is the purpose of rockets

4383.06 --> 4386.06
what

4388.1 --> 4391.780000000001
what is that kind of question

4392.3 --> 4395.320000000001
a weird question

4399.8 --> 4402.46
thank you

4433.699 --> 4439.879999999999
okay yeah but metal slugness if you say

4437.06 --> 4442.719
they don't flies it as efficient eye up

4439.88 --> 4442.719
do they

4443.06 --> 4447.14
are you saying it actually costs more

4445.219 --> 4449.4800000000005
fuel

4447.14 --> 4453.280000000001
for the same distance to fly high up

4449.48 --> 4453.28
then low down really

4457.0 --> 4463.64
my conclusion would be that they'd burn

4460.0 --> 4467.38
like roughly the same amount

4463.64 --> 4467.38
they just go faster I don't know

4467.659 --> 4473.0599999999995
don't know exactly maybe to get more

4470.6 --> 4476.679
thrust it starts to exponentially

4473.06 --> 4476.679
require more fuel or something

4477.02 --> 4480.860000000001
and I have to make it yeah tricky

4479.36 --> 4484.5199999999995
considerations like you want to get

4480.86 --> 4487.639999999999
there faster it'll cost more fuel

4484.52 --> 4489.92
but you get there faster or you could go

4487.64 --> 4493.0
slower and then it costs a little less

4489.92 --> 4493.0
but it costs more time

4494.0 --> 4496.48
okay

4497.01 --> 4500.209
[Music]

4500.36 --> 4504.46
let's put in a troll no

4504.56 --> 4511.159000000001
that Newton was definitely not a troll

4508.28 --> 4514.58
I think it was a very respected man

4511.159 --> 4518.179
or I respect him at least

4514.58 --> 4520.659
and yeah he was

4518.179 --> 4523.82
fooling around with conceptual things

4520.659 --> 4527.239
but he knew it he knew

4523.82 --> 4529.759999999999
like his gravitation like his invention

4527.239 --> 4531.5
for the club you could say

4529.76 --> 4533.360000000001
of people that are interested in that

4531.5 --> 4535.699
sort of thing

4533.36 --> 4539.0599999999995
he knew it was nonsense and he said

4535.699 --> 4541.58
don't don't freaking ascribe that [ __ ]

4539.06 --> 4543.5
then don't tell it's real and then say

4541.58 --> 4546.08
that I invented because I it's not real

4543.5 --> 4549.1
it's a concept yeah he was an honorable

4546.08 --> 4549.1
man Newton

4562.9 --> 4569.679
Stephen Hawkins or something

4566.36 --> 4569.679
a weird thing to say

4571.04 --> 4576.34
but yeah Stephen Hawking I mean Stephen

4573.38 --> 4576.34
Hawking was

4576.38 --> 4581.42
yeah

4577.82 --> 4584.0599999999995
he was pretty smart I think

4581.42 --> 4588.1990000000005
but he died somewhere like in the late

4584.06 --> 4590.4800000000005
90s and then they got out this guy

4588.199 --> 4591.98
who are all did he die recently or

4590.48 --> 4593.718999999999
something I don't know if it's that I

4591.98 --> 4597.139999999999
don't know

4593.719 --> 4598.94
but Stephen Hawking

4597.14 --> 4602.780000000001
the guy that's been rolling around doing

4598.94 --> 4606.799999999999
presentation doing cameos on Big Bang

4602.78 --> 4609.86
Theory and all that that guy

4606.8 --> 4612.320000000001
that's not Stephen Hawkins

4609.86 --> 4615.799999999999
there's no way

4612.32 --> 4617.54
in in The Logical universe that he could

4615.8 --> 4619.52
have still lived that long with that

4617.54 --> 4624.04
disease

4619.52 --> 4624.040000000001
there's no physical possibilities

4636.199 --> 4639.199
wait what oh you didn't know that Nature

4638.3 --> 4641.360000000001
Boy

4639.199 --> 4644.78
that's Stephen Hawkins that

4641.36 --> 4647.0
he just died in 90s and

4644.78 --> 4648.92
and that new guy

4647.0 --> 4652.1
supposedly rolling around in a

4648.92 --> 4655.1
wheelchair for 20 years

4652.1 --> 4658.04
that's not him it can't be him

4655.1 --> 4660.679
because that disease is absolutely fatal

4658.04 --> 4664.699
and there is absolutely no way in hell

4660.679 --> 4667.04
that that can be stopped in any way

4664.699 --> 4669.5
it's literal this integration of the

4667.04 --> 4671.8
body and it cannot be stopped you just

4669.5 --> 4671.8
die

4672.38 --> 4677.719
so that guy is kind of a look alike but

4675.56 --> 4680.900000000001
he has a different jawline his different

4677.719 --> 4684.08
teeth it's not the same guy

4680.9 --> 4685.879999999999
and I don't think he's ever even studied

4684.08 --> 4688.64
anything

4685.88 --> 4692.06
like astrophysics related like the guy

4688.64 --> 4694.280000000001
literally is just a guy in a chair used

4692.06 --> 4697.04
as a prop

4694.28 --> 4699.86
and they just

4697.04 --> 4702.38
they just remote control the robot voice

4699.86 --> 4704.48
to say what he says but he's not saying

4702.38 --> 4707.06
that half the time he's having speeches

4704.48 --> 4708.86
he's like having trouble even keeping

4707.06 --> 4710.900000000001
awake

4708.86 --> 4714.0199999999995
like he's not there with his attention

4710.9 --> 4716.739
wow the universe is the internet and

4714.02 --> 4716.7390000000005
he's just there like

4717.26 --> 4721.64
like he's not actually doing that he's

4720.08 --> 4725.6
not saying that

4721.64 --> 4729.820000000001
he's just a guy sitting there

4725.6 --> 4729.820000000001
he's not talking it's ridiculous

4732.8 --> 4737.4800000000005
now this is much more straightforward

4736.1 --> 4739.6990000000005
proven

4737.48 --> 4741.919999999999
that it's not him it's impossible that

4739.699 --> 4744.32
it's him

4741.92 --> 4747.08
the Hitler's [ __ ] yeah that's debatable

4744.32 --> 4749.42
it is debatable I'm not a hundred

4747.08 --> 4752.48
percent sure it just that's my

4749.42 --> 4757.0
conclusion it's not the same guy it's it

4752.48 --> 4757.0
was a woman who replaced him

4760.76 --> 4768.320000000001
but I mean Hitler didn't die for that

4764.48 --> 4770.659
it just it was just switched out

4768.32 --> 4773.0599999999995
Stephen Hawking died

4770.659 --> 4775.5199999999995
I guarantee it to you

4773.06 --> 4777.679
there's no person in the world with that

4775.52 --> 4780.620000000001
disease it was it ALS

4777.679 --> 4783.02
that could live that long there's

4780.62 --> 4785.36
absolutely no part like

4783.02 --> 4787.219
you the only way for them to sort of

4785.36 --> 4788.9
survive is to put them in a stasis tank

4787.219 --> 4791.0
and even that's not a guarantee there's

4788.9 --> 4793.699
just no way that anybody could ever

4791.0 --> 4795.62
survive that under any condition

4793.699 --> 4796.94
it's just not possible

4795.62 --> 4800.0599999999995
fact

4796.94 --> 4805.04
known admitted fact

4800.06 --> 4808.34
is the only exception right

4805.04 --> 4812.179
just like 9 11 was the only exception

4808.34 --> 4817.34
for steel frame billing to collapse

4812.179 --> 4820.04
because of the melting of some a bit of

4817.34 --> 4823.64
it like that's the only building ever to

4820.04 --> 4826.5199999999995
collapse because of the fire

4823.64 --> 4830.12
ever in history ever

4826.52 --> 4832.88
right so it's the same kind of scenario

4830.12 --> 4834.22
it's just nonsense

4832.88 --> 4840.609
it's not him

4834.22 --> 4840.609
[Music]

4843.32 --> 4846.82
Beacon of humanity

4848.12 --> 4851.98
yeah just like Helen Keller was

4856.34 --> 4862.12
Alan Keller was the beacon of human

4858.44 --> 4862.12
achievement pre-internet age

4862.82 --> 4867.34
no he didn't Howard don't be [ __ ]

4867.739 --> 4870.739
ridiculous

4876.199 --> 4881.36
you've been watching too many

4879.5 --> 4884.679
cartoons man

4881.36 --> 4884.679
too much Rick and Morty

4885.22 --> 4890.02
[Music]

4887.78 --> 4890.0199999999995
foreign

4893.69 --> 4896.78
[Music]

4933.159 --> 4936.339999999999
get out

4937.1 --> 4942.76
you stupid fly

4940.04 --> 4942.76
uh

4946.58 --> 4952.159
no but Newton had a letter exchange with

4950.719 --> 4954.02
people he was communicating with

4952.159 --> 4956.659
multiple by the way yeah he wrote

4954.02 --> 4958.580000000001
letters and they're all still kept

4956.659 --> 4959.96
they archived everything that he's ever

4958.58 --> 4962.48
written

4959.96 --> 4965.06
I think most of it and there is a letter

4962.48 --> 4967.459999999999
it's online you can find it in which

4965.06 --> 4969.620000000001
he's addressing somebody about how

4967.46 --> 4974.06
outraged he is that people would suggest

4969.62 --> 4976.64
that gravitation was was scientific

4974.06 --> 4979.04
so I do not claim

4976.64 --> 4983.42
any validity

4979.04 --> 4986.239
to the notion that gravitation

4983.42 --> 4988.88
would be scientific something like I'm

4986.239 --> 4991.36
paraphrasing now but that's literally in

4988.88 --> 4991.36
writing

4992.96 --> 4997.219
so you might be able to Google it Google

4995.9 --> 5002.0199999999995
find it

4997.219 --> 5005.8
otherwise I'd like have to ask Nathan

5002.02 --> 5010.1990000000005
or Quantum eraser or Adam meakin

5005.8 --> 5010.1990000000005
if he has like a PDF link

5013.239 --> 5017.82
my favorite famous no

5018.76 --> 5022.62
who gives a [ __ ] a word

5025.239 --> 5031.199
I mean from that era yeah I'm kind of a

5028.54 --> 5031.199
Newton fan

5033.04 --> 5038.92
despite everything that's happened

5035.8 --> 5041.64
yeah I am I I do think Newton was an

5038.92 --> 5041.64
honorable person

5046.96 --> 5051.82
but I mean from that time period I I

5049.6 --> 5054.179
also really happened to like George

5051.82 --> 5054.179
Washington

5059.62 --> 5062.58
or Thomas Jefferson

5063.1 --> 5067.780000000001
very Fascinate Thomas Jefferson because

5065.08 --> 5072.36
of the the Jeffersonian Bible I mean

5067.78 --> 5072.36
that is really fascinating

5072.699 --> 5079.419999999999
potentially really revolutionary even

5077.02 --> 5081.64
for now

5079.42 --> 5084.52
so I wouldn't say Newton's my favorite

5081.64 --> 5085.6
person but he's definitely on my like

5084.52 --> 5088.9800000000005
list

5085.6 --> 5088.9800000000005
for historical characters

5094.54 --> 5097.54
what

5104.8 --> 5108.6
okay Nature Boy I don't know

5110.98 --> 5113.639999999999
what

5116.679 --> 5123.219
but Landon McCartney from what era is

5120.46 --> 5125.58
that I mean aren't they like 19th

5123.219 --> 5125.58
century

5125.98 --> 5132.959999999999
or 20th early 20s I don't know but

5128.739 --> 5132.959999999999
Newton is like way before that so

5134.44 --> 5144.589
talking about a different era I think

5138.12 --> 5144.589
[Music]

5148.5 --> 5153.1
[Music]

5150.699 --> 5155.98
yeah that's really cute orinocobombo he

5153.1 --> 5157.6
said a lot about gravity what he also

5155.98 --> 5160.0
said

5157.6 --> 5162.58
Beatles yeah fine whatever

5160.0 --> 5165.28
what he also said is I do not claim a

5162.58 --> 5168.5199999999995
hypothesis to gravitation

5165.28 --> 5170.86
and that the notion of people doing that

5168.52 --> 5173.620000000001
seems Preposterous to him

5170.86 --> 5176.0199999999995
okay he also said that

5173.62 --> 5179.0199999999995
so it's really cute with all the other

5176.02 --> 5181.6
quotes and all that

5179.02 --> 5183.780000000001
he's on record having said that on

5181.6 --> 5183.780000000001
record

5185.739 --> 5190.839999999999
so yeah it's really nice I mean he'll

5188.08 --> 5193.84
explain exactly to you how to think

5190.84 --> 5197.9800000000005
about Newtonian gravity and how it works

5193.84 --> 5201.52
in his mechanism what he also knows

5197.98 --> 5203.5
explicitly that it isn't scientific it's

5201.52 --> 5206.38
just a model

5203.5 --> 5207.19
he knows it and he's been honest about

5206.38 --> 5211.64
it

5207.19 --> 5211.639999999999
[Music]

5215.739 --> 5219.94
a law and not a theory yeah but it isn't

5218.139 --> 5222.52
a law it's not a natural law though

5219.94 --> 5225.82
Welsh rice it's just his law it's the

5222.52 --> 5229.719
law for his model you see

5225.82 --> 5232.239
Newton had a model of mechanics and in

5229.719 --> 5235.36
that model there had to be the law of

5232.239 --> 5237.879999999999
gravitation for it to make any sense

5235.36 --> 5239.98
that doesn't make it scientific and it

5237.88 --> 5244.900000000001
definitely doesn't make it natural law

5239.98 --> 5247.718999999999
it just makes it a law for his model

5244.9 --> 5249.04
it's the antecedent for the model to

5247.719 --> 5252.659
function

5249.04 --> 5252.659
that's how it's a law

5253.84 --> 5259.32
I use cute a lot because I like that I

5256.6 --> 5259.320000000001
like saying that

5262.78 --> 5267.94
and it is a very indirect reference to

5265.42 --> 5269.02
something that's not really important

5267.94 --> 5270.879999999999
anyway

5269.02 --> 5274.080000000001
it used to be this

5270.88 --> 5274.08
Cartoon Network Cartoon

5274.78 --> 5280.239
with a guy

5277.86 --> 5282.04
it was a stupid cartoon but there was

5280.239 --> 5284.919999999999
this loud man in there it would always

5282.04 --> 5289.06
be saying like yeah isn't that cute

5284.92 --> 5293.26
but it's wrong that's what that's based

5289.06 --> 5295.85
on and I never say the loud it's wrong

5293.26 --> 5298.9890000000005
but that's what I think in my mind

5295.85 --> 5298.9890000000005
[Music]

5299.679 --> 5303.179
he isn't that cute

5316.54 --> 5321.159
can I show that record no I don't have

5319.239 --> 5323.379999999999
it on my computer

5321.159 --> 5325.36
think I might have it on my computer I

5323.38 --> 5329.159000000001
don't have it ready

5325.36 --> 5329.159
it's out there publicly though

5333.659 --> 5338.08
I mean there is a chance that you could

5336.219 --> 5339.58
Google search

5338.08 --> 5340.659
Newton

5339.58 --> 5342.82
right

5340.659 --> 5347.259999999999
Newton

5342.82 --> 5349.98
I claim no hypothesis for gravitation

5347.26 --> 5349.9800000000005
in quotes

5350.139 --> 5353.159000000001
or feign

5353.199 --> 5358.12
right in that but that combination

5355.78 --> 5362.32
there's a chance that you literally get

5358.12 --> 5365.58
the the actual PDF that says that

5362.32 --> 5365.58
it might just work

5371.02 --> 5377.639
otherwise I'll I'd have to ask one of

5373.48 --> 5377.638999999999
the guys that would then have to show up

5380.679 --> 5384.179
Skype is acting weird again

5388.48 --> 5391.739
it's not turning on

5391.96 --> 5396.4
so yeah I can't I literally cannot ask

5394.36 --> 5397.42
the guys right now because Skype seems

5396.4 --> 5400.0599999999995
to be

5397.42 --> 5402.219
another blank screen again that last

5400.06 --> 5405.780000000001
time that happened it had some serious

5402.219 --> 5405.78
issues with the updates for some reason

5444.58 --> 5447.28
hey

5445.43 --> 5450.52
[Music]

5447.28 --> 5453.5199999999995
all right Welsh rice thanks from Wiki

5450.52 --> 5456.42
you found it in Wiki huh

5453.52 --> 5456.42
well there you go

5458.199 --> 5461.638999999999
thank you for finding that

5464.86 --> 5472.299999999999
but yeah see I was right

5467.92 --> 5473.86
the man Newton had honor he knew he was

5472.3 --> 5476.34
about the truth

5473.86 --> 5476.339999999999
foreign

5477.48 --> 5484.678999999999
he was a man of reason with God

5481.36 --> 5484.679
I really feel that

5484.78 --> 5489.699
I think if

5486.46 --> 5491.56
I were to time travel to back then and

5489.699 --> 5493.0599999999995
had the opportunity to meet Newton I

5491.56 --> 5494.92
don't know if we'd connect the probably

5493.06 --> 5496.659000000001
think I'm a freak because he'd think

5494.92 --> 5497.86
everybody from the future would be a

5496.659 --> 5500.5599999999995
freak

5497.86 --> 5503.679
but I think that I would really admire

5500.56 --> 5504.719
him like as like wow that's ease of

5503.679 --> 5508.0
really

5504.719 --> 5510.96
enlightened man I think

5508.0 --> 5510.96
in ways

5514.719 --> 5520.2390000000005
it's weird because hey yeah here we go

5517.719 --> 5521.44
I've had dark World Vision interactions

5520.239 --> 5525.638999999999
with him

5521.44 --> 5528.46
because that happened I just I had like

5525.639 --> 5530.9800000000005
the simulation I guess

5528.46 --> 5533.52
of communicating with Newton quite

5530.98 --> 5533.5199999999995
elaborately

5535.199 --> 5540.46
which was kind of interesting because I

5538.239 --> 5542.678999999999
hadn't looked up all these things about

5540.46 --> 5545.02
it I didn't know as much about Newton

5542.679 --> 5547.4800000000005
when that Vision thing happened so it's

5545.02 --> 5550.6
like plucked from the future again it

5547.48 --> 5552.879999999999
was a simulation based on knowledge I'd

5550.6 --> 5555.58
have about him plucked from the future I

5552.88 --> 5559.96
think in retrospect

5555.58 --> 5563.44
was Newton a glober no no he was not

5559.96 --> 5565.2390000000005
and by the way neither was anybody else

5563.44 --> 5567.58
in that time period

5565.239 --> 5569.32
nobody

5567.58 --> 5572.5599999999995
huh

5569.32 --> 5576.88
yeah that idea that the Earth is really

5572.56 --> 5579.6
a globe that came I think roughly in the

5576.88 --> 5579.6
19th century

5580.38 --> 5586.4800000000005
before that time it was just like

5584.219 --> 5588.52
astronomy it was just the lights they

5586.48 --> 5590.98
didn't

5588.52 --> 5592.659000000001
it was all weird philosophical it was

5590.98 --> 5594.82
more of a thought experience they didn't

5592.659 --> 5597.58
even really think about the Earth being

5594.82 --> 5600.46
a globe they didn't

5597.58 --> 5603.5199999999995
really that's a myth that globers now

5600.46 --> 5608.139
like to say but I mean the real globe

5603.52 --> 5610.900000000001
belief it only really hit off here

5608.139 --> 5614.7390000000005
in the 20th century

5610.9 --> 5616.839999999999
around the 60s and 70s that's when it

5614.739 --> 5620.379999999999
was really hitting off

5616.84 --> 5624.34
before that there was no widespread

5620.38 --> 5628.06
Globe belief it's a lie it's a myth the

5624.34 --> 5632.02
only Globe belief that was really there

5628.06 --> 5636.280000000001
was visible in things like movies

5632.02 --> 5638.8
futurism sci-fi but that wasn't taken

5636.28 --> 5641.679
seriously by anybody it was just seen

5638.8 --> 5644.08
for what it is a bunch of Science

5641.679 --> 5645.9400000000005
Fiction weirdo stories that absolutely

5644.08 --> 5648.28
contradict the Bible

5645.94 --> 5650.44
and everybody knew that nobody was

5648.28 --> 5653.32
buying the Earth was a globe in the

5650.44 --> 5654.94
early 20th century okay nobody was

5653.32 --> 5658.259999999999
buying that [ __ ]

5654.94 --> 5662.138999999999
it's in the newspapers even

5658.26 --> 5664.38
newspaper writers editors would ridicule

5662.139 --> 5664.38
it

5665.92 --> 5670.78
the notion of it there was no Globe

5668.8 --> 5672.639
belief

5670.78 --> 5675.46
that widespread

5672.639 --> 5678.639
the the the whole philosophy or only

5675.46 --> 5682.2390000000005
really even became public outside of the

5678.639 --> 5685.06
occult in the 19th century before that

5682.239 --> 5687.04
it was all occulted the whole idea

5685.06 --> 5689.38
with astronomy and all that that was

5687.04 --> 5692.8
like their little Club

5689.38 --> 5694.3
right the astronomers the Jesuits and

5692.8 --> 5698.26
they were just doing their little

5694.3 --> 5700.96
virtual puzzle basically nobody knew

5698.26 --> 5702.46
about that let alone understand anything

5700.96 --> 5705.28
about it

5702.46 --> 5708.82
that came in the 90th century and then

5705.28 --> 5710.5
it became like a popular belief in the

5708.82 --> 5713.0199999999995
70s

5710.5 --> 5716.02
also with support of course the moon

5713.02 --> 5719.620000000001
landing act and all that and

5716.02 --> 5721.179
popularizing it in schools and all that

5719.62 --> 5722.139
before that

5721.179 --> 5725.4400000000005
it

5722.139 --> 5728.5
it was just not really there

5725.44 --> 5730.48
that's a myth that Global Believers now

5728.5 --> 5732.28
like to say because they're just

5730.48 --> 5734.62
convinced no we always knew it was a

5732.28 --> 5735.94
glove it's pure Bluff they don't know

5734.62 --> 5738.159
what the [ __ ] they're talking about

5735.94 --> 5740.08
there's absolutely no evidence for that

5738.159 --> 5741.4
whatsoever

5740.08 --> 5744.9
oh

5741.4 --> 5744.9
it's just a bluff

5752.38 --> 5758.4400000000005
[Music]

5755.44 --> 5759.759999999999
nowhere else rise not 60s and 70s 80

5758.44 --> 5763.08
what kind of a

5759.76 --> 5763.08
stupid remark is that

5764.4 --> 5771.879999999999
of course I mean the 19 sex 19 20th

5768.82 --> 5774.239
century I already said that I said 20th

5771.88 --> 5774.2390000000005
century

5777.159 --> 5783.46
the whole idea of globe Earth

5780.42 --> 5786.34
really only started arriving in the 19th

5783.46 --> 5789.82
century and then was popularized and

5786.34 --> 5794.92
public more public integrated in schools

5789.82 --> 5796.84
taught in the 20th century 60s and 70s

5794.92 --> 5800.159
this should be very obvious

5796.84 --> 5800.159000000001
that that's what I said

5802.719 --> 5808.0
Fury of the globe became a thing we

5805.9 --> 5811.48
actually got the technology out to mean

5808.0 --> 5814.06
to fool and fake that it's a glove yeah

5811.48 --> 5816.459999999999
yeah yeah once you got proficient

5814.06 --> 5818.8
technology to [ __ ] around and make

5816.46 --> 5822.219
everybody believe it's a globe through

5818.8 --> 5826.4800000000005
little trickery yeah that's

5822.219 --> 5829.0
when it became more popular

5826.48 --> 5831.4
then it became a thing oh look we can

5829.0 --> 5833.26
fool around and lie to everybody about

5831.4 --> 5835.78
how it's a globe to make everybody

5833.26 --> 5838.12
believe that

5835.78 --> 5841.12
so we can then like

5838.12 --> 5844.12
demand giant amounts of money

5841.12 --> 5846.34
to do fake nonsense science fiction

5844.12 --> 5848.98
programs

5846.34 --> 5851.679
and then everybody think it'll be real

5848.98 --> 5853.78
because they're [ __ ] [ __ ] and

5851.679 --> 5855.52
they they want to they want it they'll

5853.78 --> 5858.78
throw money at us for it yeah that's

5855.52 --> 5858.780000000001
that's what happened I know

5867.06 --> 5872.6990000000005
the globe belief was a run before Newton

5870.159 --> 5872.699
no

5879.94 --> 5882.0
no

5886.3 --> 5888.96
prove it

5889.84 --> 5893.02
show me the writing

5891.699 --> 5896.259999999999
show me the letter show me the

5893.02 --> 5897.580000000001
historical documentation of globe belief

5896.26 --> 5902.639
yeah

5897.58 --> 5902.639
from the 18th century show it come on

5908.26 --> 5914.56
why did he talk about the bulging around

5910.6 --> 5917.08
the equator yeah yeah well that's only a

5914.56 --> 5917.9800000000005
model in his mind though and he knew

5917.08 --> 5920.92
that

5917.98 --> 5923.44
it's a model he was Mo this is

5920.92 --> 5925.42
mathematics and geometrics right they

5923.44 --> 5927.04
were doing mathematics and geometrics

5925.42 --> 5929.38
that's what they did back then yeah

5927.04 --> 5932.8
that's what astronomers

5929.38 --> 5934.54
and those people yeah that's what they

5932.8 --> 5937.6
did

5934.54 --> 5941.1
they didn't think that was literal

5937.6 --> 5941.1
it's just a puzzle

5941.44 --> 5944.678999999999
yeah

5942.46 --> 5948.88
they didn't even go

5944.679 --> 5952.56
around to ever check anything physical

5948.88 --> 5952.56
they were just playing with math

5955.9 --> 5962.159
right so it's thought experiments and

5959.199 --> 5962.159
Newton knew it

5962.26 --> 5967.84
that's why separated his speculation

5965.32 --> 5971.259999999999
about this sort of thing glow bulging at

5967.84 --> 5974.1990000000005
the equator Etc so cute it's why he

5971.26 --> 5975.76
separated it from science as you rolled

5974.199 --> 5980.94
out with the quote he's separate because

5975.76 --> 5983.76
he knew it wasn't physically real

5980.94 --> 5987.638999999999
you understand

5983.76 --> 5991.360000000001
the globe of bulging I think that's

5987.639 --> 5995.139
Theory ideas in his head that he knew

5991.36 --> 5998.62
was just playing around with ideas in

5995.139 --> 6000.4800000000005
your head he knew that he knew it wasn't

5998.62 --> 6002.699
physically real

6000.48 --> 6005.339999999999
do you see

6002.699 --> 6009.259999999999
you can literally see that in the

6005.34 --> 6009.26
writing that you posted

6013.16 --> 6016.33
[Music]

6021.01 --> 6024.399
[Music]

6024.98 --> 6030.36
[ __ ] off

6027.6 --> 6033.92
no Navigators did not know about the

6030.36 --> 6033.92
globe you [ __ ] [ __ ]

6035.4 --> 6043.08
Navigators navigated using a celestial

6039.36 --> 6045.599999999999
sphere with a flat [ __ ] plane

6043.08 --> 6049.08
you say the new battle Club you're just

6045.6 --> 6053.280000000001
a [ __ ] you're just a very ill

6049.08 --> 6055.139
researched low comprehension [ __ ] if

6053.28 --> 6058.44
you say that yeah

6055.139 --> 6060.42
so just keep reasserting that garbage oh

6058.44 --> 6062.339999999999
they all knew what they do thousands of

6060.42 --> 6064.9800000000005
years ago oh they were knowing the

6062.34 --> 6067.02
global it's [ __ ] Bluff dude it's not

6064.98 --> 6068.28
true you have no evidence you don't know

6067.02 --> 6071.84
what the [ __ ] you're talking about

6068.28 --> 6075.659
you're just a globe [ __ ]

6071.84 --> 6077.82
venting your Globe tart belief without

6075.659 --> 6079.44
any foundation

6077.82 --> 6081.36
yeah

6079.44 --> 6086.0
so just shut the [ __ ] up if you're gonna

6081.36 --> 6086.0
say that in my chat okay solar brooms

6086.159 --> 6091.28
numpty [ __ ] don't know what you're

6088.86 --> 6091.28
talking about

6103.38 --> 6108.5
right

6105.119 --> 6108.5
I'm gonna round out the show

6118.219 --> 6125.9
how old is surviving globe

6121.739 --> 6125.9
you mean a map

6129.719 --> 6135.3
that's cute

6131.34 --> 6138.860000000001
how accurate was it huh

6135.3 --> 6138.860000000001
how accurate was it Arena

6138.9 --> 6145.0199999999995
not accurate at all was it

6141.719 --> 6148.02
not accurate at all also yeah that's a

6145.02 --> 6151.4400000000005
really cute model for your globe

6148.02 --> 6154.9800000000005
that's actually a projection

6151.44 --> 6160.199
known to be a projection onto a globe

6154.98 --> 6163.98
based off yeah the celestial sphere GP

6160.199 --> 6167.82
positions paralleling with a flat plane

6163.98 --> 6170.759999999999
and that's what it's a projection of

6167.82 --> 6172.739
using the very early figured out ever

6170.76 --> 6174.719
sign formula

6172.739 --> 6177.419999999999
yeah that's now much more much more

6174.719 --> 6180.36
straightforward now but yeah yeah that's

6177.42 --> 6183.4800000000005
still a flat plane

6180.36 --> 6185.46
yeah compared to the GP positions of the

6183.48 --> 6189.839999999999
celestial sphere

6185.46 --> 6192.179
and then warped into a ball because

6189.84 --> 6193.8
that's kind of easy to do relatively I

6192.179 --> 6196.56
mean with the GP positions it's

6193.8 --> 6198.119000000001
celestial sphere you just

6196.56 --> 6200.219
match it

6198.119 --> 6202.44
yeah it's not a sphere though it's not

6200.219 --> 6204.9
actually a sphere

6202.44 --> 6206.099999999999
it's just a projection into a sphere

6204.9 --> 6208.08
[Music]

6206.1 --> 6210.679
because you're just dumb and you just

6208.08 --> 6210.679
won't learn

6210.96 --> 6214.619
yeah

6212.52 --> 6216.360000000001
ah thanks for the PayPal dank I really

6254.159 --> 6261.0
number 1514

6257.36 --> 6262.98
on a Friday and I'm gonna join the Flat

6261.0 --> 6264.78
Earth debates over Nathan Oakley 9080

6262.98 --> 6268.379999999999
Channel which should start up in a few

6264.78 --> 6270.239
minutes hope to see you there in chat

6268.38 --> 6272.1
I haven't really figured out a name for

6270.239 --> 6273.959999999999
today's show

6272.1 --> 6275.820000000001
maybe I'll just keep it blank for a

6273.96 --> 6278.0
while I mean it's been kind of over the

6275.82 --> 6278.0
place

6278.28 --> 6284.099999999999
there was a lot of Flat Earth though

6282.239 --> 6287.759999999999
maybe yeah maybe I'll change it like

6284.1 --> 6290.360000000001
actually talking about flattered

6287.76 --> 6290.360000000001
all right

[Applause]

6295.6 --> 6300.81

6301.02 --> 6304.56
that's

6302.639 --> 6307.82
it's funny

6304.56 --> 6307.820000000001
I'm gonna call it this

6312.78 --> 6318.44
ah come on

6316.02 --> 6318.4400000000005
right

6319.56 --> 6324.320000000001
right anyway I hope you guys all like

6321.9 --> 6324.32
this show

6325.02 --> 6329.820000000001
and yeah again don't forget to Rogan

6326.82 --> 6332.34
said I can only see two upvotes here

6329.82 --> 6335.0599999999995
when there's a lot of people watching I

6332.34 --> 6337.9800000000005
depreciate if you'd actually just do it

6335.06 --> 6340.619000000001
actually really do it

6337.98 --> 6343.0199999999995
don't just roll over my riddle when I

6340.619 --> 6346.0199999999995
ask you to actually do the thumbs up

6343.02 --> 6347.34
Rogan's up then I I appreciate if you'd

6346.02 --> 6351.119000000001
actually do it

6347.34 --> 6353.28
and not just leave only two rogans up on

6351.119 --> 6355.739
this show where I interacted with like a

6353.28 --> 6358.5
whole range of people here

6355.739 --> 6360.36
okay unless you really didn't appreciate

6358.5 --> 6363.06
my show

6360.36 --> 6364.44
and in that case thanks a lot

6363.06 --> 6369.6900000000005
anyway

6364.44 --> 6400.969999999999
right until the next video keep it flat

6369.69 --> 6400.969999999999
