61.1 --> 67.74

you can always use the support

94.5 --> 100.5
please keep it coming

96.54 --> 102.24000000000001
right the weather today again is

100.5 --> 105.32
beautiful

102.24 --> 105.32
but windy

105.78 --> 111.5
look at how quick that those little

108.24 --> 111.5
clouds are rushing my

111.899 --> 117.979
you can literally even on the webcam see

114.24 --> 117.979
them move in relation to the tree

118.92 --> 123.119
just with the bare eyes you see it even

121.38 --> 125.82
more pronounced of course because you

123.119 --> 127.92
can actually see depth

125.82 --> 131.239
but uh

127.92 --> 131.239
yeah it's really beautiful

134.34 --> 139.5
and no Trails or well at least

137.04 --> 143.04
not that I've seen yesterday they were

139.5 --> 145.2
trying it but nothing was left I mean if

143.04 --> 148.62
there's really a lot of wind and they

145.2 --> 150.83999999999997
spray Trails of some kind

148.62 --> 153.12
they just don't stick

150.84 --> 157.16
they just get blown apart and you don't

153.12 --> 157.16
they don't block anything and in the end

157.319 --> 161.28
so

158.94 --> 164.959
yeah

161.28 --> 164.959
with the sun it's really nice

167.06 --> 170.449
[Music]

171.9 --> 177.08
hello Mike saidunich first in chat good

174.66 --> 177.07999999999998
to see you

179.34 --> 185.34
it is Wednesday the 2nd of November

182.34 --> 185.34
2022.

190.2 --> 192.5
foreign

195.2 --> 200.42
two twenty two

197.64 --> 200.42
all right

205.68 --> 209.65900000000002
hey psych bear good to see you

212.4 --> 218.519
right so yeah I'm in a mixed mood today

217.019 --> 219.48000000000002
and it has something to do with the

218.519 --> 221.159
title

219.48 --> 223.5
because yesterday on the flight Earth

221.159 --> 226.319
debate I

223.5 --> 228.36
the same thing happened as

226.319 --> 233.06
on Friday

228.36 --> 233.06
and yeah I'm I'm really sick of it now

234.78 --> 240.659
like I dropped again and then proceeded

238.319 --> 243.0
to go to chat because if I'm gonna talk

240.659 --> 245.519
[ __ ] about people behind their back I'll

243.0 --> 247.98
do it to their face and if they're then

245.519 --> 250.439
dumb enough to complain about it

247.98 --> 252.599
or really you you want me to talk behind

250.439 --> 255.599
your back instead no

252.599 --> 258.739
I'll talk behind your back to your face

255.599 --> 258.739
because that's what I do

262.26 --> 266.46
right so yesterday I have no idea what

264.9 --> 268.28
happened in the after show because I

266.46 --> 272.43
didn't go back

268.28 --> 272.42999999999995
[Music]

273.24 --> 279.6
and I don't know

275.759 --> 282.6
I'll probably still show uh join the

279.6 --> 285.72
show but if this [ __ ] happens or if they

282.6 --> 288.41900000000004
got their idea like oh we need to do an

285.72 --> 289.56
intervention to keep our win in line

288.419 --> 291.53999999999996
again

289.56 --> 293.88
then I'm gonna drop and then I'm not

291.54 --> 295.8
gonna come back for a week

293.88 --> 297.06
just for the record

295.8 --> 299.46000000000004
because

297.06 --> 302.1
it's pathetic and I don't want to

299.46 --> 304.79999999999995
associate with people

302.1 --> 307.86
that are that technically sloppy and

304.8 --> 311.40000000000003
think that they're the king of the world

307.86 --> 315.47900000000004
right because my issue is nitpicky

311.4 --> 320.75899999999996
but it is very technically correct

315.479 --> 324.12
and I think that a lot of people in fvd

320.759 --> 328.32
have by now realized it

324.12 --> 330.84000000000003
except for maybe Brian and Neil

328.32 --> 333.59999999999997
Brian doesn't seem to want to

330.84 --> 335.039
back down for anything even though I'm

333.6 --> 337.91900000000004
just pointing out how he's constantly

335.039 --> 339.78
straw Manning me and others of the panel

337.919 --> 341.52
are actually confirming that in the

339.78 --> 343.5
Skype chat

341.52 --> 346.32
even though they don't like my attitude

343.5 --> 348.76
well boohoo too bad for you cause this

346.32 --> 353.52
is who I am

348.76 --> 358.919
[Music]

353.52 --> 362.96
and hey some days I might be very just

358.919 --> 367.02
comfortable and tolerable tolerant

362.96 --> 368.75899999999996
and just like uh maneuver my way through

367.02 --> 370.919
out of it and

368.759 --> 373.02000000000004
keep it funny or something right well

370.919 --> 375.419
yesterday was not one of those days

373.02 --> 378.71999999999997
because it this was a recurring issue

375.419 --> 382.139
and nobody had corrected it or

378.72 --> 386.3
apologized the entire [ __ ] weekend

382.139 --> 389.639
so if it then pops back up and everybody

386.3 --> 392.58
immediately goes back to the table doing

389.639 --> 396.0
the same [ __ ] like nothing even happened

392.58 --> 397.62
it's gonna piss me the [ __ ] off

396.0 --> 400.5
so you're gonna have to deal with that

397.62 --> 402.24
then because I want to be taken serious

400.5 --> 404.94
yeah

402.24 --> 407.52
and if you have trouble distinguishing

404.94 --> 410.699
between when I'm Baldwin and I'm regular

407.52 --> 414.08
Arwen then you've got a problem

410.699 --> 419.84000000000003
because I'm very outspoken and clear

414.08 --> 419.84
about when I am when which one right

420.9 --> 425.58
if you got a problem with that then

423.0 --> 428.639
maybe you should be taking a few steps

425.58 --> 430.38
back taking a break to get your senses

428.639 --> 433.139
back

430.38 --> 436.15999999999997
because I have my senses and I bloody

433.139 --> 436.16
well know what I'm doing

438.36 --> 442.58000000000004
right

440.099 --> 442.58
so

443.639 --> 449.94
that's the title of the show

447.67 --> 453.12
[Music]

449.94 --> 454.199
you can get an angle to the sun with a

453.12 --> 457.56
plumber

454.199 --> 459.72
without the Horizon you can be stuck in

457.56 --> 462.06
a dry well if it's not too deep because

459.72 --> 464.34000000000003
then you only get a very slim amount of

462.06 --> 466.08
angle that you can actually spot

464.34 --> 468.35999999999996
of the Sun

466.08 --> 469.62
but you don't need to see any Horizon

468.36 --> 472.139
effect

469.62 --> 476.16
in order to establish an angle

472.139 --> 478.86
not that that proves the globe some

476.16 --> 480.66
anti-flatter this would like to suggest

478.86 --> 487.02000000000004
that's not the point that I was making

480.66 --> 489.90000000000003
my point was merely you can do that

487.02 --> 491.94
and anything else about oh but if you

489.9 --> 494.52
it's a vertical so that automatically

491.94 --> 497.759
implies or

494.52 --> 499.979
whatever the horizontal and it has to be

497.759 --> 502.8
that yeah that's all super cute and I

499.979 --> 503.87899999999996
agree I agree that wasn't the point

502.8 --> 506.78000000000003
though

503.879 --> 506.78000000000003
but apparently

507.18 --> 513.899
it's so important to emphasize those

510.12 --> 515.7
other very well-known details that we've

513.899 --> 518.94
all worked out at the Flat Earth debates

515.7 --> 522.0
especially Brian in like the last year

518.94 --> 524.5200000000001
right meticulously getting the details

522.0 --> 527.22
together for how things really work yeah

524.52 --> 529.68
I know that and I'm fully on board it's

527.22 --> 531.4200000000001
just that when somebody asks me a

529.68 --> 535.76
question

531.42 --> 539.64
and I then answer that specific question

535.76 --> 543.6
correctly and that people then spend an

539.64 --> 545.88
hour or a half an hour just blabbering

543.6 --> 548.76
it over it like it's some kind of a

545.88 --> 553.5
danger or like I'm deceiving somebody

548.76 --> 555.48
well [ __ ] you then [ __ ] you

553.5 --> 558.36
yeah

555.48 --> 561.24
if somebody asks me a question and I

558.36 --> 564.32
answer that question correctly [ __ ]

561.24 --> 564.32
deal with it

565.019 --> 570.18
I answered it correctly

567.959 --> 573.18
even though I didn't say it the way you

570.18 --> 575.279
would like to hear it I did and it was

573.18 --> 577.14
correct it's been confirmed by multiple

575.279 --> 580.38
people

577.14 --> 583.5
and I will not back down for that and I

580.38 --> 586.92
will not be walshed over and straw man

583.5 --> 589.44
the [ __ ] out of with yeah I don't

586.92 --> 592.62
tolerate that [ __ ]

589.44 --> 595.86
I answered a question correctly

592.62 --> 599.0600000000001
and then you should confirm it and then

595.86 --> 599.0600000000001
we can move on

606.08 --> 609.269
[Music]

611.94 --> 616.6800000000001
I seeking star water

614.1 --> 621.36
yeah it was weird no it's not weird it's

616.68 --> 624.2399999999999
typical it's just typical it's weakness

621.36 --> 627.42
I mean the guys

624.24 --> 629.7
they're just kind of like I get with

627.42 --> 631.74
days like that it feels to me like

629.7 --> 634.6800000000001
they're just resting on their Laurels

631.74 --> 637.5
like we won we won everything so that

634.68 --> 639.3
means that everything we say have has to

637.5 --> 641.88
always been

639.3 --> 644.399
always be correct

641.88 --> 647.16
but then they de-prioritize just

644.399 --> 649.019
technical correctness even though it

647.16 --> 650.64
might be inconvenient or give them a

649.019 --> 654.36
slight headache or they have to figure

650.64 --> 658.019
out something else whatever or give them

654.36 --> 660.48
a the feeling the vague feeling that the

658.019 --> 662.4590000000001
anti-flat earthers might abuse it which

660.48 --> 664.5600000000001
they will anyway whether I bring

662.459 --> 667.7399999999999
something like that up or not

664.56 --> 670.6199999999999
dude I basically derived that entire

667.74 --> 673.86
point from the anti-flat earthers

670.62 --> 676.079
because that was like a thing that they

673.86 --> 679.26
actually had correct

676.079 --> 682.62
however they then proceeded to add all

679.26 --> 684.959
these nonsense mechanics right and

682.62 --> 687.3
drawing like Celestial navigation and

684.959 --> 689.8199999999999
then it immediately also goes to [ __ ]

687.3 --> 691.8
that's why I didn't do that that's why

689.82 --> 694.2
when I say hey

691.8 --> 696.3599999999999
you could take the angle of the sun

694.2 --> 699.12
using a vertical

696.36 --> 701.7
yeah that has nothing to do with

699.12 --> 703.98
Celestial navigation

701.7 --> 707.1600000000001
at all

703.98 --> 710.04
right I mean getting the angle from a

707.16 --> 712.019
vertical to an angle to the sum using a

710.04 --> 715.62
vertical is not going to help you

712.019 --> 717.899
navigate the oceans I'm bloody well

715.62 --> 720.66
aware of that

717.899 --> 724.88
that's why it wasn't my argument yet

720.66 --> 728.64
everybody kept rambling over me

724.88 --> 731.579
rumpusing me with an argument that I

728.64 --> 734.8199999999999
wasn't even addressing and that I

731.579 --> 736.9799999999999
literally in between had said yeah but

734.82 --> 739.82
that's not what I'm talking about and

736.98 --> 739.82
they ignored it

741.839 --> 749.1
and now I'm here

744.32 --> 752.1
to speak my mind and my heart about it

749.1 --> 752.1
unrumpaced

762.899 --> 767.579
why does a giant snowflakes are falling

765.24 --> 770.399
oh cool

767.579 --> 773.2399999999999
that is cool so you can start water

770.399 --> 777.38
hello Igor

773.24 --> 777.38
ithm grew chick

779.6 --> 784.019
yummy sprouts

782.76 --> 787.139
hello

784.019 --> 790.5
yeah the title is correct I know

787.139 --> 793.62
it doesn't prove anything

790.5 --> 796.92
about a supposed Globe Earth though even

793.62 --> 799.62
though anti-flat Earth this has lovingly

796.92 --> 801.779
used it as like the first little step up

799.62 --> 804.0
to give a suggestion like it's all right

801.779 --> 805.74
and they can all do it on the globe yeah

804.0 --> 809.04
you can't

805.74 --> 811.38
yeah you can't navigate a globe using a

809.04 --> 813.899
plumb bob and the angles to the Sun

811.38 --> 815.459
it doesn't actually work right because

813.899 --> 817.38
if you want to navigate you're going to

815.459 --> 820.3199999999999
have to go over the ocean well have you

817.38 --> 822.36
ever tried to use a plumb bob on a

820.32 --> 825.779
rocking boat

822.36 --> 827.399
hmm yeah oh it keeps moving just like

825.779 --> 830.279
the boat doesn't it yeah so it's

827.399 --> 832.56
completely useless there I know

830.279 --> 835.4399999999999
yeah just like a bubble Saxon is

832.56 --> 837.54
completely useless on the ocean I know

835.44 --> 839.519
that's why they didn't use that they

837.54 --> 841.92
used the horizon

839.519 --> 842.94
which is at a 90 degree from The

841.92 --> 846.12
Observer

842.94 --> 848.22
with yeah slight correction

846.12 --> 852.36
but that's always there even when you're

848.22 --> 854.1
super high up so that's I know that I

852.36 --> 856.5
know everything about that I've been

854.1 --> 859.38
listening for hundreds and hundreds of

856.5 --> 863.76
hours hearing that being explained in

859.38 --> 865.8
detail over and over and over again what

863.76 --> 867.36
you think that I just [ __ ] forgot

865.8 --> 872.4799999999999
that now

867.36 --> 872.48
you have to remind me Brian

873.54 --> 878.04
maybe you should just try to keep it

876.0 --> 880.199
together a little

878.04 --> 883.68
figure out what's real and what's not

880.199 --> 885.66
who who you're talking to yeah I'm not a

883.68 --> 887.279
[ __ ] [ __ ] I'm smarter than you

885.66 --> 889.56
Brian

887.279 --> 891.6
you might be better at math but I'm

889.56 --> 894.68
smarter than you

891.6 --> 897.6
and I've proven that time and time again

894.68 --> 900.3
and they will keep proving that time and

897.6 --> 902.16
time again now if your ego is not in the

900.3 --> 904.56
position to be able to handle that in

902.16 --> 907.26
this very moment then it's your [ __ ]

904.56 --> 910.1389999999999
problem not mine

907.26 --> 912.959
because I like that you're smart I do

910.139 --> 915.899
not like it when you're like this

912.959 --> 918.2399999999999
you're just [ __ ] you're not looking

915.899 --> 920.519
you've got [ __ ] in your ears and you're

918.24 --> 923.04
blabbering out of your mouth and I hate

920.519 --> 925.38
it when you do that sucks

923.04 --> 927.06
I call it the leprechaun

925.38 --> 929.6
because that's what it feels like when

927.06 --> 929.5999999999999
you do that

930.44 --> 934.229
[Music]

934.339 --> 938.639
hey Godzilla

936.959 --> 940.92
yeah thank you for that super chat

938.639 --> 942.839
yesterday that was great that you did

940.92 --> 945.42
that

942.839 --> 947.0400000000001
although you kind of flop the text a bit

945.42 --> 949.4399999999999
at the end but

947.04 --> 951.36
I appreciate that that you guys really

949.44 --> 953.639
took notice of what I was doing in chat

951.36 --> 956.6990000000001
because I was very upset I wasn't gonna

953.639 --> 958.38
go back because I knew I would not I

956.699 --> 960.7199999999999
would barely get a word in I would just

958.38 --> 962.399
be getting oh you're just repeating the

960.72 --> 964.1990000000001
same thing over again you're just

962.399 --> 966.66
repeating the same thing over again let

964.199 --> 968.8199999999999
me Walt over all the rest of it now

966.66 --> 972.0
and reassert the things that we

968.82 --> 975.6600000000001
mistakenly thought about what you said

972.0 --> 976.92
yeah well no thanks I'll just stick to

975.66 --> 979.68
chat then

976.92 --> 981.899
so that it can say the things exactly

979.68 --> 984.899
the way I want to say without other

981.899 --> 987.54
people having trouble reading what I'm

984.899 --> 988.38
saying because I can't get rumpus in the

987.54 --> 990.959
chat

988.38 --> 993.8389999999999
yeah so that's what I did

990.959 --> 997.0999999999999
it's not a joke to me and it's not

993.839 --> 997.1
[ __ ] funny either

999.2 --> 1002.8000000000001
[Music]

1000.71 --> 1005.6
[Applause]

1002.8 --> 1008.779
other than that I've been having a great

1005.6 --> 1011.24
day by the way

1008.779 --> 1014.0
might be some rage amplification because

1011.24 --> 1016.1
of the bright light and the wind

1014.0 --> 1019.579
it's my estimate

1016.1 --> 1022.36
because I don't feel pissed off at all

1019.579 --> 1022.3599999999999
I'm just

1022.519 --> 1025.519
intenser

1026.059 --> 1029.74
am I talking about

1030.799 --> 1033.98
talking about Flat Earth debates

1032.6 --> 1036.74
yesterday

1033.98 --> 1039.14
that's what I'm talking about

1036.74 --> 1040.4
and have been mostly addressing the Flat

1039.14 --> 1044.14
Earth debate

1040.4 --> 1044.14
panel and Nathan

1045.98 --> 1049.66
but in particular Brian

1051.23 --> 1054.489
[Music]

1059.36 --> 1061.84
right

1071.84 --> 1074.559
hmm

1074.86 --> 1078.6399999999999
hey PGC net

1085.76 --> 1088.48
all right

1091.0 --> 1098.48
I got my healer on the phone by the way

1093.919 --> 1100.8200000000002
again just not always easy to get

1098.48 --> 1103.22
and he said I was in a really good

1100.82 --> 1106.1
condition actually

1103.22 --> 1108.02
like I had only one typical issue and I

1106.1 --> 1111.98
always have that every single time he

1108.02 --> 1113.12
read me I've never been like above 50

1111.98 --> 1115.82
percent

1113.12 --> 1118.4599999999998
like 50 earthing

1115.82 --> 1121.4189999999999
in my body as he says all the other

1118.46 --> 1123.76
traits that I was completely undisrupted

1121.419 --> 1126.2
untainted untagged

1123.76 --> 1129.08
balanced Sharp

1126.2 --> 1131.8400000000001
and in good health so

1129.08 --> 1133.6399999999999
yeah that was surprising because I

1131.84 --> 1135.3799999999999
always think that I guess I have a

1133.64 --> 1137.72
tendency to think that I'm doing worse

1135.38 --> 1140.44
than I'm actually doing

1137.72 --> 1140.44
it's weird

1141.679 --> 1146.72
just sort of weird internal pessimism or

1144.44 --> 1149.299
something I don't know

1146.72 --> 1151.46
but I'm doing great and hey my show

1149.299 --> 1155.0
yesterday was like one of the best shows

1151.46 --> 1156.5
maybe that I've done ever it was a great

1155.0 --> 1160.0
show

1156.5 --> 1162.74
it connected a lot of things

1160.0 --> 1166.22
a lot of things

1162.74 --> 1168.38
about myself about all this time and

1166.22 --> 1171.8600000000001
doing things

1168.38 --> 1174.679
just what are you doing in life what

1171.86 --> 1178.9599999999998
have I been doing in life what how was I

1174.679 --> 1178.96
tricked what things are there to like

1179.6 --> 1186.1399999999999
rip yeah to at first seem to give us

1183.679 --> 1189.44
what we need but then turns out to be

1186.14 --> 1191.179
exactly 180 degrees the opposite to

1189.44 --> 1193.5800000000002
destroy that

1191.179 --> 1196.7
to drive us insane and weaponize us

1193.58 --> 1199.8799999999999
against Society without us being

1196.7 --> 1202.539
consciously aware at least at first

1199.88 --> 1204.98
right I connected it all together

1202.539 --> 1207.14
yesterday's show was fantastic I'm

1204.98 --> 1208.94
really proud of it

1207.14 --> 1211.5800000000002
so if you haven't actually watched that

1208.94 --> 1214.8200000000002
I I definitely recommend you watch that

1211.58 --> 1214.82
show yeah

1215.32 --> 1219.32
psychological environmentalism

1219.5 --> 1223.82
episode show number 1409

1224.179 --> 1227.6200000000001
one of my best shows

1228.44 --> 1233.5
anyways

1230.72 --> 1233.5
ah

1233.6 --> 1238.5
today is a bit of a sharing grievances

1236.419 --> 1242.8290000000002
type of Jody

1238.5 --> 1242.829
[Music]

1242.9 --> 1248.14
anyway

1244.94 --> 1248.14
how are you guys doing

1277.82 --> 1283.8799999999999
or maybe you'd like me to also direct my

1281.179 --> 1286.16
shouting at you since there's no several

1283.88 --> 1287.8400000000001
minutes silence again up we just seen it

1286.16 --> 1290.5
Justin Time

1287.84 --> 1290.5
uh

1302.12 --> 1304.9599999999998
what

1310.1 --> 1315.52
why is car who's that I have no idea

1337.159 --> 1344.2990000000002
it says that his

1340.52 --> 1346.34
his any map any Flat Earth what

1344.299 --> 1348.62
that's

1346.34 --> 1351.1589999999999
a bit trouble reading that if you just

1348.62 --> 1351.1589999999999
seeing that

1364.88 --> 1370.5800000000002
okay so mikatun is basically saying you

1368.419 --> 1372.679
can't use any map

1370.58 --> 1374.8999999999999
is that it it's just saying you can't

1372.679 --> 1377.6000000000001
use any map

1374.9 --> 1380.299
it's going to be tough to navigate in

1377.6 --> 1383.539
any type of way without a map

1380.299 --> 1386.1399999999999
and there's only so many maps that we

1383.539 --> 1386.14
even have

1391.46 --> 1398.919
all of which are claimed to be glow

1394.64 --> 1398.919
projections so yeah

1409.4 --> 1414.799
right that's yeah okay well that's a

1412.28 --> 1417.82
highly unreasonable challenge so mctoon

1414.799 --> 1423.02
is basically saying okay Fred earthers

1417.82 --> 1426.58
make a map without the celestial Globe

1423.02 --> 1426.58
template what

1431.179 --> 1436.52
so if you just make a map then

1433.52 --> 1439.039
differently I don't know it sounds like

1436.52 --> 1441.74
a trick question

1439.039 --> 1443.48
did I watch Owen's show yesterday I'm

1441.74 --> 1445.22
I'm kind of in the middle of watching it

1443.48 --> 1447.64
I was watching it before I started the

1445.22 --> 1451.519
show it's like where it was interesting

1447.64 --> 1451.519
[Music]

1456.02 --> 1460.7
it's so weird sometimes I just get the

1458.179 --> 1464.3200000000002
feeling that he watches my shows

1460.7 --> 1464.32
but I'm pretty sure he doesn't

1466.64 --> 1473.539
it's just that starts to address things

1469.94 --> 1477.0800000000002
that well I just addressed and then it's

1473.539 --> 1480.02
like come on did he just naturally come

1477.08 --> 1481.46
up with that all by himself or did he

1480.02 --> 1484.1589999999999
just

1481.46 --> 1486.4
hear it for me it's so weird to see that

1484.159 --> 1486.4
happen

1490.22 --> 1496.4
like how we address the whole Flat Earth

1493.039 --> 1497.539
versus Globe seemed to be very much a

1496.4 --> 1499.88
stance

1497.539 --> 1501.799
well that I've been trying to promote

1499.88 --> 1504.0800000000002
for years

1501.799 --> 1505.8799999999999
right where it just doesn't matter as

1504.08 --> 1508.52
much whether you believe in the globe or

1505.88 --> 1510.8600000000001
the Flat Earth and he was addressing a

1508.52 --> 1512.299
whole bunch of that and it was really

1510.86 --> 1514.6999999999998
admirable

1512.299 --> 1516.44
but it does make me feel like oh come on

1514.7 --> 1518.3600000000001
Owen if you've been watching my streams

1516.44 --> 1520.64
that's been like an item of mine for

1518.36 --> 1523.24
quite a while

1520.64 --> 1523.24
it's like

1524.24 --> 1530.48
and I had pretty much just addressed it

1527.32 --> 1533.5
on yesterday's show no less or or the

1530.48 --> 1533.5
day before I'm not sure

1533.659 --> 1537.22
what yeah that keeps happening

1537.85 --> 1542.04
[Music]

1546.04 --> 1550.1599999999999
[Music]

1550.179 --> 1554.98
you know what is much more weird even

1555.559 --> 1560.48
I watched this show from what is it

1557.9 --> 1564.02
Saturday or something or Friday

1560.48 --> 1565.58
and apparently it is sad now going right

1564.02 --> 1567.98
I don't know I don't follow any of it

1565.58 --> 1572.059
that Andrew Tate

1567.98 --> 1575.679
has supposedly become Muslim

1572.059 --> 1575.6789999999999
well that's certainly

1575.72 --> 1579.559
something

1577.159 --> 1581.48
and gonna have like a whole range of

1579.559 --> 1583.76
weird effects

1581.48 --> 1586.779
I mean Andrew Tate's been like on the

1583.76 --> 1586.779
Alex Jones's show

1590.539 --> 1594.3799999999999
that Alex is not gonna like that he did

1593.539 --> 1597.76
that

1594.38 --> 1597.7600000000002
if he cares at all

1598.22 --> 1601.3600000000001
so that was kind of weird

1609.02 --> 1612.1589999999999
anything else

1617.99 --> 1621.349
[Music]

1637.64 --> 1642.74
foreign

1640.1 --> 1645.02
but anyway back to what you said we just

1642.74 --> 1647.24
needed I mean it's a trick question

1645.02 --> 1649.22
any map that is a projection of the

1647.24 --> 1652.039
globe is not allowed

1649.22 --> 1654.8600000000001
that's very cute because it's not

1652.039 --> 1657.44
actually a projection of the globe

1654.86 --> 1659.8999999999999
that's just what they say it is it's

1657.44 --> 1661.279
flat and it's based of the celestial

1659.9 --> 1665.48
sphere

1661.279 --> 1668.0
then like hammered in lockstep with the

1665.48 --> 1670.279
surface of Earth and through the angular

1668.0 --> 1673.4
correlations of the heavens

1670.279 --> 1676.159
right that's actually what a map

1673.4 --> 1678.679
projection is it's not literally a

1676.159 --> 1681.919
projection of the globe Earth it's a

1678.679 --> 1685.46
projection based off the correlations

1681.919 --> 1687.44
with the celestial globe and the Earth's

1685.46 --> 1690.52
surface

1687.44 --> 1694.7
so it's just a universal stupid little

1690.52 --> 1697.34
anti-flatter trick challenge as usual

1694.7 --> 1701.659
that's why you should just delete like

1697.34 --> 1703.82
leave mc2 just let him rot in a quarter

1701.659 --> 1705.98
he always does this kind of crap it's

1703.82 --> 1709.059
all trick questions all he ever does is

1705.98 --> 1709.059
stupid trick questions

1710.12 --> 1716.6789999999999
so

1712.34 --> 1716.6789999999999
oh yeah Ladle TV I noticed that

1722.299 --> 1726.22
yeah little TV it looked interesting

1734.36 --> 1736.4799999999998
okay

1736.76 --> 1742.76
yeah so there's another way

1739.94 --> 1745.1000000000001
to deal with miktoon's challenge then

1742.76 --> 1746.6
and that is to just call it out exactly

1745.1 --> 1749.84
like I did

1746.6 --> 1752.84
yeah explain exactly what I just said

1749.84 --> 1756.559
and I'm not the first one to say that

1752.84 --> 1760.8799999999999
it's correct yeah the globe projection

1756.559 --> 1764.72
is a projection of the celestial globe

1760.88 --> 1768.679
the apparent star sphere as we perceive

1764.72 --> 1771.44
it and then made in lock step with the

1768.679 --> 1773.179
Earth's surface not the scale yeah it's

1771.44 --> 1776.799
not the scale that's why no map is the

1773.179 --> 1780.98
scale because it's actually anchored

1776.799 --> 1784.7
on the lock stepping of the celestial

1780.98 --> 1786.559
sphere with the flat land surface that's

1784.7 --> 1788.72
why it's not the scale because it's

1786.559 --> 1789.9189999999999
based on the celestial sphere not a

1788.72 --> 1793.52
globe Earth

1789.919 --> 1797.0590000000002
that's just a rumor a ruse

1793.52 --> 1800.2
that just refuses to go away

1797.059 --> 1800.2
because it's not true

1801.02 --> 1806.36
and the only real way to deal with it is

1803.6 --> 1810.559
to just keep calling it out

1806.36 --> 1813.52
keep saying it and then just ignore him

1810.559 --> 1818.1789999999999
because he's setting a false challenge

1813.52 --> 1821.24
it's a setup and it's based on a lie

1818.179 --> 1822.8600000000001
and he literally disqualifies you based

1821.24 --> 1825.38
on his lie

1822.86 --> 1828.4399999999998
so how does a globe projection no it

1825.38 --> 1831.74
isn't there is no Globe Earth projection

1828.44 --> 1835.159
it's the celestial sphere

1831.74 --> 1838.279
that's the sphere that's that globe that

1835.159 --> 1840.0200000000002
seems to be pointed at in the map

1838.279 --> 1842.299
projections because that's what it's

1840.02 --> 1845.36
derived from that's how they got the

1842.299 --> 1850.279
angles how the relations the celestial

1845.36 --> 1853.52
sphere not Globe Earth it's a total

1850.279 --> 1854.6
setup and you shouldn't buy into it at

1853.52 --> 1857.0
all

1854.6 --> 1858.74
and Claire keep clarifying it keep

1857.0 --> 1861.679
saying it in the chat exactly what I

1858.74 --> 1863.779
said keep making a little video response

if that's what you're into and say this

1863.779 --> 1870.08
and just leave it to that because he's

1866.659 --> 1872.419
gonna just keep on [ __ ] out his

1905.48 --> 1910.82
well any qualified Navigator knows that

1908.48 --> 1912.799
you use the horizon

1910.82 --> 1915.74
for navigation

1912.799 --> 1919.46
at a 90 degree angle

1915.74 --> 1922.88
and so it's over immediately

1919.46 --> 1926.24
unless they don't want to officially

1922.88 --> 1929.2990000000002
come out for it right because they know

1926.24 --> 1932.059
that these bunch of demonic scumbags

1929.299 --> 1935.4189999999999
called anti-flat earthers will literally

1932.059 --> 1938.539
start like calling institutions and

1935.419 --> 1941.2990000000002
police on them yeah that's a good reason

1938.539 --> 1943.279
why not to come out for that

1941.299 --> 1945.62
unless you know how to deal with that

1943.279 --> 1948.62

projections it's a lie

1968.24 --> 1973.64
it's based on the celestial sphere not

1998.08 --> 2002.9189999999999
disqualifying people on your challenge

because they use a map

2002.919 --> 2008.2

and maybe never maybe I'm just going to

death

2157.78 --> 2160.8590000000004
I could do that too

something else

2247.0 --> 2252.599
actually take a break that's what I

2249.52 --> 2252.599
think I'm gonna do

2254.079 --> 2259.9
then not listen

2257.02 --> 2262.32
to anything either just have some peace

2259.9 --> 2262.32

change their attitude if Nathan's not

2303.46 --> 2309.28
gonna make an apology

2306.16 --> 2312.52
then I'll just not go back and I mean it

2309.28 --> 2315.94
and I'll disconnect permanently

2312.52 --> 2318.52
yeah I mean there's not it's not like I

2315.94 --> 2321.82
[ __ ] need the Flat Earth debates okay

2318.52 --> 2324.22
I've liked the cooperation and this

supposed friendship

yeah that apparently should be

yeah I don't think so

2333.099 --> 2336.099
right

2334.06 --> 2338.859
and I'd love to continue

2336.099 --> 2341.8
but not like this and I'm not gonna

2338.859 --> 2345.04
[ __ ] apologize and I want an apology

2341.8 --> 2348.0600000000004

2345.04 --> 2348.06
about this [ __ ]

kick me out and I'll never come back you

on the things you're interested in how

about you just listen and start

2384.76 --> 2390.82
blabbering over other people

how about that yeah I mean we don't even

2586.9 --> 2593.859
all right yes I know but look

whatever I do Baldwin

I do it to train you I do it to Train

2596.859 --> 2602.5
everybody and Nathan gets this

2599.38 --> 2605.8
but Nathan I don't know what is going on

2602.5 --> 2607.78
I think that he has just issues feeling

2605.8 --> 2609.579
out when I'm actually doing bowling

2607.78 --> 2612.7200000000003
because a lot of the time he starts to

2609.579 --> 2616.599
roll out weird explanations on how I'm

2612.72 --> 2619.72
accomplishing some anti-flatter trick

2616.599 --> 2622.44
when that's not what I'm doing at all

2619.72 --> 2622.4399999999996
I mean

2623.579 --> 2629.98
sometimes he like overconspiracizes my

2626.859 --> 2632.02
intent as Bowen

2629.98 --> 2633.94
which kind of is funny

2632.02 --> 2637.119
because

2633.94 --> 2638.619
I don't I'm not even focused on a lot of

2637.119 --> 2641.02
that [ __ ]

2638.619 --> 2643.54
and by the way it's interesting because

2641.02 --> 2645.64
I don't think that a lot of anti-flatter

2643.54 --> 2647.859
authors are even consciously focused on

2645.64 --> 2651.52
that it's just the way they do things

2647.859 --> 2653.7999999999997
that just automatically leads to that

2651.52 --> 2655.3
they don't consciously think about it I

2653.8 --> 2657.88
think

2655.3 --> 2661.02
they feel it out

2657.88 --> 2661.02
and so do I

2661.06 --> 2667.06
but yeah I'm not always borrowing

2664.78 --> 2669.94
especially when I'm gonna get pissed off

2667.06 --> 2672.339
I'm not bowing

2669.94 --> 2673.7200000000003
yeah Bowen doesn't get pissed off you

2672.339 --> 2675.7599999999998
might have noticed you might have

2673.72 --> 2678.339
noticed has anybody noticed Bowen

2675.76 --> 2681.3390000000004
doesn't get pissed off

2678.339 --> 2683.92
you might get frustrated

2681.339 --> 2687.94
when he's being rumpus or whatever

2683.92 --> 2689.859
but even then he will go at it on a more

2687.94 --> 2691.96
comedic level on a more comedic

2691.96 --> 2695.56
pissed off

2724.599 --> 2729.7000000000003
boundaries I mean

2727.359 --> 2731.7999999999997
just like last week you know when I'm

2729.7 --> 2734.74
going Baldwin and Nathan's like ah stop

2731.8 --> 2737.2200000000003
it now then I stop it then I'll stop

2734.74 --> 2737.22
doing that

2737.319 --> 2741.599
because I'm not doing it to attack them

2745.119 --> 2749.619
right

2746.5 --> 2752.56
but if something I'm saying is

2749.619 --> 2755.5
interpreted as Baldwin and then like

2752.56 --> 2758.68
politically went against like this

2755.5 --> 2760.9
nonsense about oh you can't get an angle

2758.68 --> 2762.8799999999997

you better damn bro believe it you can

doesn't fix anything it doesn't prove

2773.38 --> 2778.78
without the Horizon I don't give a [ __ ]

2776.079 --> 2781.2400000000002
what your stupid blabbermouth excuses

2778.78 --> 2783.76
are you can do that and that's a fact

2781.24 --> 2785.64
and if you can't get over that then you

2783.76 --> 2788.38
got a really big [ __ ] problem

2785.64 --> 2791.68
emotionally because it's not even an

2788.38 --> 2793.6600000000003

2791.68 --> 2796.7799999999997
the Earth is a [ __ ] Globe you dumbass

2793.66 --> 2799.66
why are you being so neurotic about it

2796.78 --> 2802.9
it doesn't prove the globe

2799.66 --> 2805.359
it's just possible it's just the

2802.9 --> 2807.94
exception yeah you can get that freaking

2805.359 --> 2810.72
angle without the Horizon it's possible

2807.94 --> 2812.859
oh no

2810.72 --> 2816.7
how terrible

2812.859 --> 2820.5989999999997
oh no what you think you lost now is

your trust in God in God's design of the

2820.599 --> 2825.52

2823.119 --> 2828.819

[ __ ] mouth when somebody points out a

fact

2830.22 --> 2835.54
oh no

2832.359 --> 2838.42
well I guess you're a lot more insecure

2835.54 --> 2841.44
about your position in Flat Earth than

2838.42 --> 2844.839
previously assumed then

2841.44 --> 2848.56
weakness is what that's called yeah and

the angle against the elevator what is

2881.38 --> 2886.599
the elevation angle yeah that's cool I

2883.9 --> 2889.119
mean my point is not addressing that

2886.599 --> 2890.6800000000003
but if somebody simply asks me how are

2889.119 --> 2892.599
you going to get that angle to the Sun

2890.68 --> 2895.4199999999996
and they think they're smart for asking

2892.599 --> 2897.52
that because they assume immediately

2895.42 --> 2900.04
that it involves the Horizon and thus

2897.52 --> 2902.38
the 90 degree well no it doesn't I'm

2900.04 --> 2905.98
sorry I'm sorry that you couldn't get

2902.38 --> 2909.339
your instant gratification win I'm so

2905.98 --> 2911.619
sorry but yeah you can actually get that

2909.339 --> 2916.119
freaking angle without the Horizon I'm

2911.619 --> 2919.1800000000003
sorry you can't get your instant squared

2916.119 --> 2920.56
why'd you just get over it and deal with

2919.18 --> 2923.6189999999997
the facts

2920.56 --> 2926.5
mainly that you can actually get that

2923.619 --> 2929.26
angle without the Horizon you just can't

2926.5 --> 2932.74
get it on the ocean yeah because on the

2929.26 --> 2936.3390000000004
ocean the ground rocks and then you have

2932.74 --> 2939.8799999999997
to use the Horizon because a plum Bob or

2936.339 --> 2943.72
a bubble is not gonna work out at all

2939.88 --> 2946.54
at all and I recognize that that's why I

2943.72 --> 2949.18
would never say well you don't need the

2946.54 --> 2951.099
Horizon for Celestial navigation because

2949.18 --> 2953.44
I know it's [ __ ]

2951.099 --> 2956.5
and if you're going to ask me how did

2953.44 --> 2958.78
you get that angle to the sun I'll say I

2956.5 --> 2960.579
use the freaking plumb bob

2958.78 --> 2962.7400000000002
in a well

2960.579 --> 2965.319
no Horizon needed

2962.74 --> 2967.4199999999996
and it's be it'll be true

2965.319 --> 2969.819
and that's a fact that you need to get

2967.42 --> 2971.8
the [ __ ] over that that that's a fact

2969.819 --> 2974.14
and that there's nothing you can do

2971.8 --> 2976.619
about that that's true

2974.14 --> 2976.6189999999997
yeah

2976.92 --> 2983.079
deal with it

2979.66 --> 2985.12
or it's gonna deal with you

2983.079 --> 2988.29
hey Peter Cruiser

2985.12 --> 2988.29
[Music]

2991.18 --> 2998.339
oh no damn it

2994.3 --> 2998.3390000000004
not again with the damn cricket

3013.079 --> 3018.3
correct information Euclid agrees with

3015.359 --> 3019.56
me thank you I I don't think Euclid is

3018.3 --> 3022.619
still alive

3019.56 --> 3025.2
but yeah euclidean geometry definitely

3022.619 --> 3028.7400000000002
agrees with me because I didn't just

3025.2 --> 3031.9199999999996
make this [ __ ] up like a like a red

3028.74 --> 3035.9399999999996
herring excuse nonsense story I made

3031.92 --> 3038.7000000000003
this up as a realization like yeah yeah

3035.94 --> 3042.359
that's actually real and I it Disturbed

3038.7 --> 3044.7599999999998
me before when anti-flat earther through

3042.359 --> 3046.98
the Discord back then would start to

3044.76 --> 3049.2000000000003
talk about like oh yeah but we don't

3046.98 --> 3051.54
need to arise we could use a bubble to

3049.2 --> 3055.2
establish the angle and and it's like

3051.54 --> 3058.079
yeah that's [ __ ] annoying I know but

3055.2 --> 3061.2
it's true it's true

3058.079 --> 3064.7400000000002
it's just that well if that's about

3061.2 --> 3067.02
Celestial navigation if that's involved

3064.74 --> 3069.1189999999997
in the inquiry in the story at hand

3067.02 --> 3071.099
that's being debated well then you can

3069.119 --> 3073.859
simply say oh how did you use that

3071.099 --> 3075.7200000000003
bubble on the boat how did you use that

3073.859 --> 3076.5589999999997
bubble on the boat hey Auntie flat

3075.72 --> 3078.0789999999997
earther

3076.559 --> 3082.1400000000003
oh yes

3078.079 --> 3084.2000000000003
yeah it's not gonna work is it yeah

3082.14 --> 3087.6189999999997
very simple

3084.2 --> 3087.6189999999997
very simple

3090.26 --> 3096.3590000000004
[Music]

3093.119 --> 3099.38
you don't need the Horizon to get an

3096.359 --> 3101.7
angle to any of the celestials

3099.38 --> 3104.48
unless they're very close to the Horizon

3101.7 --> 3104.48
and yeah well

3107.04 --> 3111.24
that's why yeah if you're gonna do the

3109.14 --> 3114.42
celestial navigation you're gonna end up

3111.24 --> 3117.2999999999997
on C aren't you mostly where it's used I

3114.42 --> 3118.079
mean you don't automatically drift on

3117.3 --> 3120.7200000000003
land

3118.079 --> 3123.42
you just your own land it's there it's

3120.72 --> 3125.819
not gonna change

3123.42 --> 3128.28
but on the ocean yeah you do need to get

3125.819 --> 3130.859
your bearing and you can't use a bubble

3128.28 --> 3132.5400000000004
Sextant nor can you use a plumb bob

3130.859 --> 3134.2799999999997
to get a vertical

3132.54 --> 3136.619
in order to get those angles you're

3134.28 --> 3137.8190000000004
going to need the Horizon that's just a

3136.619 --> 3140.28
fact

3137.819 --> 3142.74
but on land you don't so if it's just

3140.28 --> 3146.8190000000004
hey how did you get that angle to the

3142.74 --> 3147.9599999999996
Sun Well I use the vertical done

3146.819 --> 3150.24
right

3147.96 --> 3153.3
if that was the question then that can

3150.24 --> 3155.819
be the answer now if you would amend

3153.3 --> 3158.46
that question a little if you said like

3155.819 --> 3162.5589999999997
how would you get that angle to the sun

3158.46 --> 3162.559
while so while navigating

3163.7 --> 3171.0589999999997
oh yeah now I can say plumb bob yeah

3166.8 --> 3173.099
yeah oh no oh it's so hard it's so hard

3171.059 --> 3174.6600000000003
to get it right to get it correct is it

3173.099 --> 3178.8590000000004
oh

3174.66 --> 3181.6189999999997
oh see why I'm so pissed off

3178.859 --> 3184.0789999999997
see why I'm pissed off

3181.619 --> 3188.46
because it's embarrassing it's

3184.079 --> 3191.46
embarrassing to me that these guys keep

3188.46 --> 3194.099
rolling into this nonsense and that they

3191.46 --> 3196.68
don't see these things that I'm now very

3194.099 --> 3198.839
clearly pointing out

3196.68 --> 3203.819
it pisses me off

3198.839 --> 3205.319
tells me that the level is is slowly

3203.819 --> 3207.42
going down

3205.319 --> 3210.18
it's going downhill that's what it makes

3207.42 --> 3212.2200000000003
me feel and it's pathetic because we are

3210.18 --> 3214.7999999999997
as Flat Earth as an especially Flat

3212.22 --> 3216.72
Earth Debaters in like the most winning

3214.8 --> 3219.599
position ever

3216.72 --> 3222.359
I mean we literally cannot lose this

3219.599 --> 3226.079
debate we've already won

3222.359 --> 3229.319
so why allow yourself to then degenerate

3226.079 --> 3232.02
and get sloppy is intolerable yeah

3229.319 --> 3233.4
that's how they actually can win

3232.02 --> 3237.42
yeah

3233.4 --> 3238.859
if success defeats you

3237.42 --> 3240.42
then

3238.859 --> 3245.24
even

3240.42 --> 3245.2400000000002
the biggest of losers can win

3246.0 --> 3249.599
yeah just because you're in a winning

3247.68 --> 3252.3799999999997
position and doesn't mean that you can't

3249.599 --> 3252.38
[ __ ] it up

3259.14 --> 3263.72
and that and that's not just about the

3261.42 --> 3268.2000000000003
debate it's about everything

3263.72 --> 3270.9599999999996
all things business family

3268.2 --> 3272.819
all these things oh you think you're you

3270.96 --> 3274.5
got the Ultimate Tools you're in the

3272.819 --> 3278.099
ultimate position you got the ultimate

3274.5 --> 3280.5
opportunity well you better then take

3278.099 --> 3284.099
the responsibility serious

3280.5 --> 3285.599
cause you can lose all that you can just

3284.099 --> 3288.1800000000003
lose that [ __ ]

3285.599 --> 3290.46
by not taking it serious by being sloppy

3288.18 --> 3293.22
by being lazy

3290.46 --> 3297.079
by being easily distracted

3293.22 --> 3297.0789999999997
by being arrogant

3297.31 --> 3300.42
[Music]

3302.46 --> 3307.8
yeah I take the Flat Earth debates very

3305.099 --> 3310.44
serious it's not just some YouTube show

3307.8 --> 3312.96
it's a Wizards Council and when I say

3310.44 --> 3314.48
that those things it's not just

3312.96 --> 3317.099
metaphorical

3314.48 --> 3319.8
not just metaphorical

3317.099 --> 3323.7000000000003
it's very serious to me

3319.8 --> 3325.6800000000003
it's a development that is quite unique

3323.7 --> 3328.98
I don't know if I'd be able to find

3325.68 --> 3332.0589999999997
anything back like that in the world

3328.98 --> 3332.059
if this stopped

3332.52 --> 3337.619
and that's why I treasure and protect it

3335.52 --> 3340.74
and the only way I can do that is by

3337.619 --> 3343.4
being myself and being strict and

3340.74 --> 3343.3999999999996
merciless

3345.83 --> 3349.06
[Music]

3351.78 --> 3357.78
the only way you can actually protect

3353.94 --> 3361.04
something that is really valuable

3357.78 --> 3363.8390000000004
to miss either of those fact factors

3361.04 --> 3366.38
it's going to be destroyed You're Gonna

3363.839 --> 3366.38
Lose It

3369.559 --> 3372.8590000000004
so anyway

3373.8 --> 3378.559
that was me rambling on for an hour

3375.96 --> 3378.559
about this

3387.72 --> 3392.0589999999997
[Music]

3390.319 --> 3395.099
foreign

3392.059 --> 3397.6800000000003
yes or in Oklahoma Indeed it can also be

3395.099 --> 3399.6600000000003
done without the Horizon under certain

3397.68 --> 3402.48
circumstances

3399.66 --> 3403.5589999999997
you have to have Solid Ground under your

3402.48 --> 3406.5
feet

3403.559 --> 3408.42
to do it properly because if you're on

3406.5 --> 3410.88
moving ground

3408.42 --> 3413.339
or on the ocean

3410.88 --> 3416.099
you can't use the vertical

3413.339 --> 3417.96
why because you're moving and then yeah

3416.099 --> 3420.3590000000004
Plumb Bob's not gonna sit still it's

3417.96 --> 3422.04
gonna be like a weird instable pendulum

3420.359 --> 3424.68
it's like how are you going to establish

3422.04 --> 3426.42
that vertical you can't it's moving and

3424.68 --> 3428.8999999999996
with a bubble it's the same thing Bob is

3426.42 --> 3428.9
just going to go

3429.079 --> 3435.2400000000002
it's pointless but on land it works and

3433.38 --> 3438.2400000000002
that's just a fact

3435.24 --> 3441.1189999999997
it's not particularly useful for

3438.24 --> 3443.52
Celestial navigation but it is a

3441.119 --> 3446.2200000000003
mechanical possibility and that's just a

3443.52 --> 3447.96
fact and that's really all this was

3446.22 --> 3450.4399999999996
about it's about what is technically

3447.96 --> 3450.44
correct

3451.68 --> 3458.16
because if you lose sight of that

3455.16 --> 3460.92
you lose sight of all of it and it all

3458.16 --> 3465.319
just becomes a political game

3460.92 --> 3465.319
and I refuse to let that happen

3466.74 --> 3473.3889999999997
[Music]

3477.44 --> 3482.7200000000003
by the way

3480.119 --> 3482.7200000000003
right

3495.359 --> 3501.359
I work yeah it's a bit hard dude I'm not

3498.48 --> 3502.5
saying that Effie is a goner absolutely

3501.359 --> 3504.72
not

3502.5 --> 3507.119
but it is getting in a bit of a rut

3504.72 --> 3509.52
again it's not the first time this has

3507.119 --> 3512.28
happened okay this happens every now and

3509.52 --> 3514.92
then like even a team can just kind of

3512.28 --> 3516.5400000000004
get stuck in a ditch for a while yeah

3514.92 --> 3518.94
and then you're gonna have to pull that

3516.54 --> 3521.16
car out of the ditch together because

3518.94 --> 3523.02
alone it's not gonna work

3521.16 --> 3524.46
and then eventually they'll get back on

3523.02 --> 3528.299
the road

3524.46 --> 3531.7200000000003
right unless somebody's gonna be like no

3528.299 --> 3533.28
I refuse to go on with with him he's

3531.72 --> 3536.2799999999997
always in her way

3533.28 --> 3538.1400000000003
okay well then why don't you try pull

3536.28 --> 3540.9
that car back out of the rut without

3538.14 --> 3542.46
with one person less than yeah with the

3540.9 --> 3545.88
knowledge that you kicked somebody out

3542.46 --> 3549.7200000000003
when things went bad yeah

3545.88 --> 3551.96
see how that's gonna weigh on your moral

3549.72 --> 3551.9599999999996
spirit

3556.7 --> 3561.66
[Music]

3558.66 --> 3561.66
hmm

3565.5 --> 3570.839
here it is there's what what is that

3568.98 --> 3573.839
Direct

3570.839 --> 3573.839
no

3573.96 --> 3580.52
damn you and your freaking Cricket no

3577.5 --> 3580.52
Cricket links

3587.66 --> 3591.74
bad parent bad

3610.26 --> 3614.4
show us suffered ever since leaving

3611.94 --> 3617.04
Discord no

3614.4 --> 3619.619
I disagree

3617.04 --> 3623.46
I mean have you tried gilded it works

3619.619 --> 3626.48
fine it works better it actually works a

3623.46 --> 3626.48
lot better than Discord

3627.059 --> 3632.6400000000003
but yeah it's relatively new but it's

3630.0 --> 3634.799
it's really blooming up I mean I have a

3632.64 --> 3640.52
lot of faith in in Guild it it works

3634.799 --> 3640.52
better way way better than this card

3643.02 --> 3648.24
oh it's the Fe show I was stuck oh okay

3646.799 --> 3650.46
sorry

3648.24 --> 3653.359
I thought you were taught that was about

3650.46 --> 3653.359
damn Cricket again

3673.559 --> 3676.3390000000004
okay

3677.52 --> 3683.52
yeah that's like

3679.7 --> 3686.8799999999997
exclusively Indian so I wouldn't be able

3683.52 --> 3689.54
to know what they said there

3686.88 --> 3689.54
a turret

3689.76 --> 3697.2000000000003
why did FTD leave Discord uh because the

3694.02 --> 3700.4
Discord Surfer got basically infiltrated

3697.2 --> 3700.3999999999996
and then taken down

3701.819 --> 3707.2799999999997
innocent yeah Somebody went in and

3704.94 --> 3710.76
started to spam like I don't know

3707.28 --> 3713.52
vertical misinformation or something

3710.76 --> 3716.4
and then write it

3713.52 --> 3718.559
like took a picture of that and sent a

3716.4 --> 3721.2200000000003
complaint and they shut down the surfer

3718.559 --> 3721.2200000000003
completely

3722.4 --> 3726.48
it might be back up I don't think so

3725.04 --> 3730.88
though I think they completely just

3726.48 --> 3730.88
deleted the server so that's why

3731.64 --> 3738.66
yeah fvd then switch the guild it

3735.48 --> 3741.0
because also well apparently Betty had

3738.66 --> 3743.5789999999997
already been kind of preparing it so

3741.0 --> 3746.52
that it was actually like right there to

3743.579 --> 3749.46
get initiated and then this happened so

3746.52 --> 3751.799
it was just there quickly

3749.46 --> 3754.799
and it's working great so far I mean I

3751.799 --> 3759.9
like it when I was on Discord sometimes

3754.799 --> 3760.859
it was so [ __ ] buggy it's annoying as

3759.9 --> 3764.88
[ __ ]

3760.859 --> 3767.96
right constantly had to log out and back

3764.88 --> 3771.1800000000003
in again like every [ __ ] 15 minutes

3767.96 --> 3773.7
because it would just no longer register

3771.18 --> 3777.5989999999997
my sound out of my mic

3773.7 --> 3779.22
for no explicable reason every 15

3777.599 --> 3782.6400000000003
minutes sometimes

3779.22 --> 3784.4399999999996
I cannot believe how annoying and buggy

3782.64 --> 3786.42
Discord is

3784.44 --> 3788.46
I don't want to deal with it I hate it I

3786.42 --> 3792.54
always hated it because it was like that

3788.46 --> 3795.42
from the freaking start from the start

3792.54 --> 3799.619
it would just cut you off

3795.42 --> 3801.78
just like that for no reason just like

3799.619 --> 3803.4
and then like oh oh yeah you can't talk

3801.78 --> 3805.559
anymore oh yeah now you have to log out

3803.4 --> 3807.9
in again because you just can't talk

3805.559 --> 3811.38
anymore yeah for no [ __ ] reason

3807.9 --> 3813.42
freaking Discord man what a piece of

3811.38 --> 3816.42
[ __ ]

3813.42 --> 3816.42
foreign

3820.55 --> 3823.7090000000003
[Music]

3831.46 --> 3837.75
[Music]

3837.78 --> 3842.579
it's owned by Roblox yeah I heard I

3840.66 --> 3843.66
don't know even what Roblox is by the

3842.579 --> 3846.55
way

3843.66 --> 3849.6189999999997
sound a lot like roadblocks

3846.55 --> 3849.619
[Music]

3853.68 --> 3860.16
how many ballets will you find on there

3857.04 --> 3863.22
or as many as are willing to come up

3860.16 --> 3865.74
I mean if those Ballers were only there

3863.22 --> 3868.14
because it was convenient to them

3865.74 --> 3870.5989999999997
because they just happened to have like

3868.14 --> 3872.7
to hang around on Discord

3870.599 --> 3874.38
that's their freaking problem then

3872.7 --> 3876.5989999999997
apparently they don't really care to

3874.38 --> 3880.38
come on right because you can come on

3876.599 --> 3881.7000000000003
you can just come on through gilded it's

3880.38 --> 3883.98
not that difficult

3881.7 --> 3885.48
this might even be simpler than using

3883.98 --> 3888.299
Discord

3885.48 --> 3889.319
and then yeah even as a baller you can

3888.299 --> 3891.059
just

3889.319 --> 3893.339
be part of the show

3891.059 --> 3896.119
Nathan accepts that you're gonna get the

3893.339 --> 3898.099
typical treatment probably but

3896.119 --> 3902.4
I mean

3898.099 --> 3904.619
if you want to come on fvd through Gil

3902.4 --> 3906.599
lip you can

3904.619 --> 3909.599
just because people some people on

3906.599 --> 3912.6600000000003
Discord are just too lazy to actually go

3909.599 --> 3915.839
there and try that out

3912.66 --> 3918.839
yeah that's their problem

3915.839 --> 3921.299
I mean people that are too lazy to do

3918.839 --> 3924.92
things usually aren't really worth it

3921.299 --> 3924.92

oh holy [ __ ]

3963.66 --> 3967.16
what is this

3969.26 --> 3976.619
what okay I don't know who's this is but

3973.98 --> 3980.0
who posted this thing

3976.619 --> 3980.0
what the [ __ ]

3980.86 --> 3988.48
[Music]

3992.28 --> 3998.28
okay I'm going to present that actually

3994.559 --> 4000.2000000000003
lva Paul dug up this picture somewhere

3998.28 --> 4002.8390000000004
and it is

4000.2 --> 4005.2
quite astonishing I don't know if it's

4002.839 --> 4005.2
fiction

4005.68 --> 4011.24
or whether it's kind of recognizable

4009.619 --> 4013.7000000000003
though

4011.24 --> 4015.4399999999996
it it looks a little bit like the moon

4013.7 --> 4017.98
map

4015.44 --> 4017.98
but

4018.14 --> 4024.2
like

4020.059 --> 4027.26
well more accurate dewarped look at this

4024.2 --> 4031.72
this is really fascinating

4027.26 --> 4031.7200000000003
I've never seen this one before just

4041.0 --> 4047.02
I'm presenting it right now take a look

4044.18 --> 4047.02
look at this

4047.059 --> 4050.6800000000003
I mean what

4054.22 --> 4062.18
I've never seen a map like this that is

4057.319 --> 4064.7
so that seems so bloody cohesive

4062.18 --> 4066.2599999999998
I mean this could be it this could be

4064.7 --> 4068.5989999999997
the map

4066.26 --> 4071.48
or it could be somebody's interpretation

4068.599 --> 4074.8590000000004
of what it the map would be

4071.48 --> 4074.859
but this might be it

4093.22 --> 4096.94
absolutely fascinating

4098.6 --> 4101.6
foreign

4111.679 --> 4116.62
I kind of want a higher resolution scan

4114.14 --> 4116.62
of this

4118.279 --> 4124.64
yeah very interesting indeed I know

4122.179 --> 4127.4800000000005
I mean like this like immediately

4124.64 --> 4131.56
triggers my map

4127.48 --> 4131.5599999999995
drawing skills and [ __ ]

4133.819 --> 4139.900000000001
bro look at those islands like in front

4136.4 --> 4139.9
of Africa what

4140.42 --> 4146.95
what the hell

4141.99 --> 4146.95
[Music]

4158.359 --> 4162.56
oh yeah and oh yeah this is yeah and

4160.58 --> 4164.48
this one North America is an incredibly

4162.56 --> 4167.859
tiny by the way

4164.48 --> 4167.8589999999995
which is kind of hilarious

4168.679 --> 4173.14
too bad it's on the ball oh really is it

4173.6 --> 4178.6
I'm sorry this looks like a disc to me

4176.0 --> 4178.6
not a ball

4180.14 --> 4183.6990000000005
how is this on the ball

4187.1 --> 4193.0
looks more like just like there's this

4190.46 --> 4195.7390000000005
the lines on the

4193.0 --> 4198.8
familiar Earth Realm

4195.739 --> 4201.08
space right that's the celestial angles

4198.8 --> 4203.6
so there's a Celestial projection even

4201.08 --> 4208.239
on there but it doesn't seem to reach

4203.6 --> 4208.2390000000005
outside into the unfamiliar zones there

4212.02 --> 4216.76
another friend how the [ __ ] do you know

4231.51 --> 4234.799
[Music]

4234.98 --> 4237.639999999999
anyway

4238.04 --> 4242.32
just wanted to share that for a moment

4243.739 --> 4249.218999999999
I really do hope to get a higher

4245.719 --> 4249.219
resolution Scana then

I don't know

4314.12 --> 4321.4
it's just a freaking black dot

4317.3 --> 4321.400000000001
there is seems to be a thing

4321.5 --> 4328.34
where it's designated but like it's too

4325.699 --> 4331.46
too low resolution to make out what the

4328.34 --> 4334.28
letters are actually saying

4331.46 --> 4336.56
it might be like the water hole or

4334.28 --> 4339.44
something it might be good rain

4336.56 --> 4342.620000000001
I mean it's like a black hole so yeah

4339.44 --> 4344.719
what else would that represent

4342.62 --> 4348.0199999999995
or maybe it's the freaking magnetic

4344.719 --> 4350.86
Mountain maybe that's where it is

4348.02 --> 4350.860000000001
I don't know

4368.48 --> 4371.259999999999
foreign

4386.32 --> 4393.739
from the patents we see on the moon

4388.76 --> 4395.02
maybe it might be I'm not sure

4393.739 --> 4398.48
foreign

4395.02 --> 4401.2390000000005
God I'm getting some really like dreams

4398.48 --> 4403.699
back by the way seeing that thing

4401.239 --> 4408.5
did you know that when I was 17 I had

4403.699 --> 4411.919999999999
like really really heavy deep dreams

4408.5 --> 4415.28
of looking at a map

4411.92 --> 4418.82
like a world map of all kinds of places

4415.28 --> 4421.759999999999
that were completely alien to me and it

4418.82 --> 4425.599999999999
was so curious about it I still remember

4421.76 --> 4428.780000000001
the rough shape of it it was like

4425.6 --> 4430.820000000001
a couple of familiar continents and it

4428.78 --> 4433.04
would basically look like that

4430.82 --> 4434.659
like the image

4433.04 --> 4435.86
that you saw right of the familiar

4434.659 --> 4439.04
continents

4435.86 --> 4441.5
but then much much more there was like

4439.04 --> 4444.92
six times more room around that and I

4441.5 --> 4448.4
could like in my dream scroll around and

4444.92 --> 4452.4800000000005
have all these totally unfamiliar

4448.4 --> 4456.44
land shapes and I would be like huh what

4452.48 --> 4457.94
is that where is that what is there I

4456.44 --> 4460.339999999999
want to know

4457.94 --> 4464.0599999999995
and I didn't even like that was in

4460.34 --> 4466.88
dreams literally in my dreams

4464.06 --> 4470.06
and I don't know where I even saw that

4466.88 --> 4472.34
from maybe I had seen something

4470.06 --> 4475.6990000000005
but it didn't feel like this is a

4472.34 --> 4478.659000000001
fantasy map you know it depth like that

4475.699 --> 4478.659
was the real world

4478.699 --> 4482.96
it was a map of the real world and I

4481.1 --> 4485.6
don't know where I got it other than

4482.96 --> 4488.84
through dreams

4485.6 --> 4491.4800000000005
and I still roughly remember like what

4488.84 --> 4493.9400000000005
it kind of looked like

4491.48 --> 4496.339999999999
and this is like one of the first things

4493.94 --> 4498.678999999999
that actually kind of comes close to

4496.34 --> 4500.42
triggering that memory

4498.679 --> 4503.2390000000005
freaky

4500.42 --> 4505.46
but this shouldn't even be technically

4503.239 --> 4508.699
it

4505.46 --> 4511.76
I mean this is basically like

4508.699 --> 4513.139999999999
a two and a half times the total amount

4511.76 --> 4516.62
of surface

4513.14 --> 4519.02
right well on that map that I saw in my

4516.62 --> 4520.58
dream when I was 17 and didn't even know

4519.02 --> 4522.620000000001
about the freaking Flat Earth or

4520.58 --> 4524.96
couldn't remember at least because it

4522.62 --> 4529.28
was a glober

4524.96 --> 4531.92
like you would have the known continents

4529.28 --> 4536.179
and [ __ ] over here and then you would

4531.92 --> 4537.58
have like giant amounts of land with

4536.179 --> 4540.679
like

4537.58 --> 4544.1
more land and then another giant chunk

4540.679 --> 4547.36
over there and it's like the known Earth

4544.1 --> 4551.900000000001
Realms would have been like

4547.36 --> 4554.0599999999995
one-sixth maybe one tenth of all the

4551.9 --> 4556.58
land surface that I could see

4554.06 --> 4560.06
I mean that entire thing made Africa

4556.58 --> 4562.96
look just like a like a regular Island

4560.06 --> 4562.96
comparison

4566.719 --> 4572.199
so I'm really wondering like where is

4569.179 --> 4572.1990000000005
this coming from and

4573.44 --> 4579.58
how did they establish that

4575.84 --> 4579.58
is it indeed through the Moon

4580.04 --> 4586.82
or is this based on other ways maybe

4583.94 --> 4590.259999999999
they did this through scrying maybe they

4586.82 --> 4592.58
did litcho astro projection map making

4590.26 --> 4593.900000000001
who knows man

4592.58 --> 4596.54
I don't know

4593.9 --> 4598.5199999999995
but certainly extremely fascinating I'm

4596.54 --> 4601.0
going to present it again just so you

4598.52 --> 4601.0
can see

4639.44 --> 4643.5199999999995
what

4640.58 --> 4646.42
more cartoons what what are you talking

4643.52 --> 4646.42
about Orinoco

4647.12 --> 4649.78
what

4655.4 --> 4659.799999999999
I don't understand what you're saying

4671.22 --> 4674.4890000000005
[Music]

4678.23 --> 4681.7
[Music]

4684.46 --> 4691.76
right but anyway just seeing a map like

4688.76 --> 4695.42
this immediately does tell you that

4691.76 --> 4698.84
the chance of an actual Dome becomes

4695.42 --> 4701.12
Slimmer and Slimmer and slimmer

4698.84 --> 4702.5
the more lanter turns out to be because

4701.12 --> 4704.96
what you're going to do is like oh wait

4702.5 --> 4707.54
no oh that actually was like six times

4704.96 --> 4710.06
more land so the Dome has to then be

4707.54 --> 4711.44
different shaped so whatever you think

4710.06 --> 4714.38
is going to be the content is going to

4711.44 --> 4716.5
then in your mind determine how big this

4714.38 --> 4719.96
supposed Dome is

4716.5 --> 4723.98
what if it's just not a freaking don't

4719.96 --> 4725.12
what if it's just a flat top

4723.98 --> 4728.239
right

4725.12 --> 4731.84
that we're like a giant petri dish now

4728.239 --> 4733.159
whether that petri dish is round shaped

4731.84 --> 4738.32
or

4733.159 --> 4740.299999999999
looping or whatever it might be vast

4738.32 --> 4743.179
it might mean

4740.3 --> 4745.6990000000005
that are known Earth realm is just a

4743.179 --> 4748.04
tiny little segment

4745.699 --> 4749.419999999999
within the total amount of available

4748.04 --> 4752.96
space

4749.42 --> 4755.9
which has to have a limit because there

4752.96 --> 4757.58
is no Infinite Space that cannot exist

4755.9 --> 4760.0
logically

4757.58 --> 4760.0
all right

4763.699 --> 4769.699
flat pain with plane Between Heaven and

4766.82 --> 4772.13
Earth yeah that's one way to say it yeah

4769.699 --> 4774.94
Michael Gunn

4772.13 --> 4778.04
[Music]

4774.94 --> 4780.919999999999
are you talking kind of like the picture

4778.04 --> 4783.92
Dave well that David Weiss's picture

4780.92 --> 4785.36
that seems look I think that that

4783.92 --> 4787.46
picture

4785.36 --> 4789.38
it's one of the early ones that we got

4787.46 --> 4792.58
to see I think that that is actually

4789.38 --> 4792.58
completely fictional

4792.679 --> 4797.56
like act actually fictional

4795.98 --> 4802.48
this thing

4797.56 --> 4802.4800000000005
does not look fictional to me

4803.719 --> 4808.42
this looks much more like it could be

4806.12 --> 4808.42
real

4813.679 --> 4819.9800000000005
right I mean just put this next to that

4818.0 --> 4821.6
other one with the supposed Island

4819.98 --> 4823.94
surrounding

4821.6 --> 4827.3
the Antarctic disc

4823.94 --> 4831.08
that one looks like a cheap

4827.3 --> 4833.2390000000005
nerd creation I mean I could draw more

4831.08 --> 4835.64
convincing looking Maps than that

4833.239 --> 4839.0
supposed Chinese map

4835.64 --> 4842.0
it does not look realistic at all not

4839.0 --> 4845.56
even close this thing yeah this thing

4842.0 --> 4845.56
looks like that could be real

4854.3 --> 4857.860000000001
so very interesting

4858.64 --> 4863.900000000001
how can you tell it's more real or less

4861.86 --> 4867.04
real

4863.9 --> 4869.36
I can't explain that to you it's about

4867.04 --> 4873.0199999999995
knowing whether something is actually

4869.36 --> 4876.199
real or not with maps there's something

4873.02 --> 4878.4800000000005
about how land is shaped

4876.199 --> 4880.339999999999
that will tell you whether it is

4878.48 --> 4884.0199999999995
completely made up

4880.34 --> 4884.02
or whether it's realistic

4887.12 --> 4891.04
it's hard to explain

4894.5 --> 4900.4
but as somebody that's actually drawn a

4897.38 --> 4904.219
lot of fictional Maps as a hobby

4900.4 --> 4907.099999999999
I have definitely stumbled upon what

4904.219 --> 4909.679
does make your map look realistic and

4907.1 --> 4912.7390000000005
what makes it look not realistic

4909.679 --> 4915.26
and what is that why

4912.739 --> 4918.62
and about scaling issues

4915.26 --> 4919.400000000001
for the designer I figured out a lot of

4918.62 --> 4922.64
it

4919.4 --> 4925.879999999999
on pure intuition and I know when a map

4922.64 --> 4929.9800000000005
could be real or not based purely on the

4925.88 --> 4929.9800000000005
layout purely on what I'm seeing

4930.44 --> 4936.62
right and this one is one of the first

4933.92 --> 4940.34
maps that I've ever come across

4936.62 --> 4943.179
that I'm actually saying holy [ __ ] this

4940.34 --> 4943.179
could be real

4945.739 --> 4950.9
like a map that just immediately gives

4948.26 --> 4953.360000000001
me that impression

4950.9 --> 4955.4
something I have not experienced with

4953.36 --> 4958.62
any of the other ones

4955.4 --> 4958.62
[Music]

4960.94 --> 4968.5599999999995
colors make it more realistic

4963.5 --> 4968.56
perhaps it's not just the colors though

4968.96 --> 4975.26
it's the way that all that extra land

4972.26 --> 4975.26
looked

4978.14 --> 4983.42
and that there's like there seems to be

4980.36 --> 4985.88
designations of icy regions and not I

4983.42 --> 4987.8
see regions as well and so it was just

4985.88 --> 4990.9800000000005
more elaborate

4987.8 --> 4993.679
anyway so just intuition yeah that's

4990.98 --> 4996.739
right just intuition yeah

4993.679 --> 4999.679
that that just that just that little

4996.739 --> 5003.178999999999
thing that literally helps

4999.679 --> 5006.88
you survive and able to continue

5003.179 --> 5009.88
existing in Harsh Times and complex time

5006.88 --> 5013.659000000001
yeah just intuition yeah

5009.88 --> 5015.76
that that one thing that makes

5013.659 --> 5019.739
entire nations

5015.76 --> 5019.7390000000005
just just intuition yeah

5023.56 --> 5028.3
what extra lives would have been

5025.96 --> 5031.3
discarded of course of course

5028.3 --> 5033.820000000001
of course it would have been

5031.3 --> 5036.159000000001
it's ridiculous to assume that there is

5033.82 --> 5038.92
land in the realm

5036.159 --> 5042.339999999999
that has not been set foot on

5038.92 --> 5044.7390000000005
at some point in history

5042.34 --> 5048.96
it would have had to

5044.739 --> 5048.959999999999
because people don't go to places

5049.36 --> 5052.0
like

5049.9 --> 5053.86
[Music]

5052.0 --> 5055.719
wait

5053.86 --> 5059.199
the way I want to say it now people just

5055.719 --> 5060.94
always go to places where they can

5059.199 --> 5063.58
and they'll do it

5060.94 --> 5066.46
it just happens

5063.58 --> 5068.8
now if they can't because it's literally

5066.46 --> 5071.7390000000005
just completely unlivable it's like all

5068.8 --> 5073.6
just a giant ice cap yeah you're not

5071.739 --> 5076.178999999999
gonna live there then

5073.6 --> 5078.400000000001
right so it might have been thousands of

5076.179 --> 5079.54
years ago that somebody said foot there

5078.4 --> 5080.799999999999
[Music]

5079.54 --> 5083.62
but

5080.8 --> 5085.360000000001
I mean I'm not gonna be theoretically

5083.62 --> 5087.82
shocked

5085.36 --> 5089.62
if like some Expedition at some point

5087.82 --> 5091.48
goes there and they're like holy [ __ ] we

5089.62 --> 5093.64
just found pottery

5091.48 --> 5094.54
he's like yeah duh what do you expect

5093.64 --> 5096.280000000001
man

5094.54 --> 5099.219
what do you think you're the first

5096.28 --> 5101.88
person ever to set foot here you got to

5099.219 --> 5101.88
be joking

5102.51 --> 5108.2390000000005
[Music]

5105.159 --> 5108.239
I mean come on

5110.27 --> 5118.780000000001
[Music]

5115.96 --> 5120.96
right yep you just seen it yeah it's

5118.78 --> 5124.9
more than that intuition makes Kings

5120.96 --> 5126.94
intuition forms Nations

5124.9 --> 5130.599999999999
okay

5126.94 --> 5132.94
intuition is the survival against

5130.6 --> 5136.0
more reasonable odds

5132.94 --> 5138.159
that's the intuition yeah and that forms

5136.0 --> 5141.54
Nations

5138.159 --> 5141.54
it creates winners

5144.52 --> 5150.85
[Music]

5153.13 --> 5157.8
[Music]

5155.38 --> 5157.8
all right

5159.719 --> 5166.679
anyways hope you're enjoying the show

5162.88 --> 5166.679
it's been kind of double

5167.02 --> 5174.1
first hour was pretty much a elaborate

5169.96 --> 5176.199
uh critic piece that I will not take

5174.1 --> 5178.84
back

5176.199 --> 5181.36
crazy to think that I would

5178.84 --> 5183.78
and it's just gonna be what it is and

5181.36 --> 5186.82
we'll see what happens

5183.78 --> 5189.04
just as long as nobody actually thinks

5186.82 --> 5192.179
that they can make me apologize for

5189.04 --> 5194.139
something that I shouldn't do

5192.179 --> 5195.58
apologize for

5194.139 --> 5197.679
and won't

5195.58 --> 5199.78
it doesn't matter if there's like a

5197.679 --> 5202.36
hundred people all going oh come on

5199.78 --> 5203.44
Arwin and say yeah oh come on go [ __ ]

5202.36 --> 5207.12
all of you

5203.44 --> 5207.12
what the [ __ ] do you think I am

5208.179 --> 5213.46
right and I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm

5211.659 --> 5216.4
right and people

5213.46 --> 5218.38
don't give me my right that I have

5216.4 --> 5221.199
because I was right

5218.38 --> 5224.1990000000005
I'm gonna be a bit of an [ __ ] and

5221.199 --> 5227.379999999999
trust me it can be thousands of times

5224.199 --> 5229.419999999999
worse than anything you've ever seen you

5227.38 --> 5232.179
know what I got inside of me so don't

5229.42 --> 5235.42
you [ __ ] complain that I shouldn't

5232.179 --> 5237.04
talk like that because you ain't seen

5235.42 --> 5240.28
nothing

5237.04 --> 5242.98
yeah I'm not planning to go there but

5240.28 --> 5244.9
you cannot seriously expect me to bite

5242.98 --> 5246.48
my tongue after I've just been

5244.9 --> 5251.379999999999
wrongfully

5246.48 --> 5253.78
humiliated by multiple people yeah

5251.38 --> 5258.6
don't you [ __ ] dare tell me to hold

5253.78 --> 5258.599999999999
my tongue I will not ever

5260.66 --> 5264.3589999999995
[Music]

5270.52 --> 5276.900000000001
yeah

5272.76 --> 5276.900000000001
hey the studio 68

5280.12 --> 5285.36
doing a reverse images I don't know how

5282.88 --> 5285.36
that works

5287.5 --> 5292.42
but it's yeah I'm gonna definitely save

5290.199 --> 5295.299999999999
that picture

5292.42 --> 5297.159
to my desktop

5295.3 --> 5300.659000000001
and hopefully we'll find a better

5297.159 --> 5300.659
version of it at some point

5305.02 --> 5307.92
wait what

5312.06 --> 5320.080000000001
[Music]

5315.159 --> 5324.839999999999
is the desktop yeah all right

5320.08 --> 5324.84
yeah so I'm gonna lose it at least now

5328.33 --> 5331.939
[Music]

5342.52 --> 5346.5
30 watching oh nice

5358.98 --> 5364.679999999999
Nazi UFO bases what

5361.659 --> 5367.799
what are you talking about

5364.68 --> 5367.799
[Music]

5370.6 --> 5373.26
oh

5374.139 --> 5377.04
what

5383.739 --> 5388.86
the map I just present oh okay really

5408.46 --> 5414.159
I mean yeah well maybe they were maybe

5411.76 --> 5416.5
they are maybe they're there who are you

5414.159 --> 5418.839999999999
to say that they aren't I mean oh no the

5416.5 --> 5421.659
Nazis building basis

5418.84 --> 5424.6
around the world maybe even beyond the

5421.659 --> 5426.638999999999
known lands who could have thought of

5424.6 --> 5429.400000000001
that would be possible I mean do you

5426.639 --> 5431.7390000000005
automatically think that anytime any map

5429.4 --> 5434.5
is going to show you Nazi bases on there

5431.739 --> 5437.159
that that automatically means that it's

5434.5 --> 5437.159
[ __ ]

5439.719 --> 5445.06
it's a genuine question it's not like a

5442.36 --> 5447.5199999999995
rhetorical question

5445.06 --> 5449.820000000001
do you really think that it that about

5447.52 --> 5454.38
it or

5449.82 --> 5454.38
maybe that's just what it is

5454.42 --> 5461.7390000000005
all right all right fair enough

5457.32 --> 5461.739
[Music]

5461.86 --> 5466.0
stuff originated in August this year

5464.62 --> 5468.84
what

5466.0 --> 5468.84
okay

5494.02 --> 5498.820000000001
is there even any commentary about how

5496.42 --> 5503.1
they made this man

5498.82 --> 5503.099999999999
I mean is it based on the moon

5507.159 --> 5513.299999999999
or

5508.84 --> 5513.3
is it created in some other way

5513.52 --> 5517.659000000001
someone posted it on Twitter okay yeah

5515.8 --> 5520.12
that doesn't really mean anything but

5517.659 --> 5523.42
look if there's literally Nazi bases

5520.12 --> 5526.0
being marked on there then I can pretty

5523.42 --> 5528.1
much guarantee you that it is like early

5526.0 --> 5530.8
20th century then

5528.1 --> 5534.6
because before that there were no there

5530.8 --> 5534.6
yeah why would they Mark that

5535.54 --> 5538.199
so

5538.54 --> 5545.28
it's probably from the 30s then

5542.26 --> 5545.280000000001
or the 40s

5546.28 --> 5552.96
maybe 20s

5549.46 --> 5552.96
but probably 30s

5553.179 --> 5558.2390000000005
what are we talking about Jessica yeah

5555.04 --> 5558.239
God what

5558.78 --> 5563.699
talking about a map again

5566.199 --> 5572.379999999999
this one that I just bumped into on

5569.739 --> 5574.78
Skype lva Paul

5572.38 --> 5577.2390000000005
posted that

5574.78 --> 5579.28
it's really interesting but yeah this

5577.239 --> 5581.678999999999
particular image is not a super high

5579.28 --> 5584.92
resolution so I can't actually read the

5581.679 --> 5586.78
text which is a bit frustrating

5584.92 --> 5589.679
I'd like to get my hands on a higher

5586.78 --> 5589.679
resolution version

5590.139 --> 5593.04
foreign

5597.54 --> 5601.56
surface overlay interesting

5602.139 --> 5608.26
but there is no an issue with that so it

5605.86 --> 5610.659
might have been Loosely inspired on the

5608.26 --> 5613.360000000001
moon then perhaps

5610.659 --> 5615.28
could be I don't know the origin of it I

5613.36 --> 5617.32
just know that is probably from the

5615.28 --> 5619.92
1930s

5617.32 --> 5619.92
but

5620.38 --> 5628.32
to be found at the U.N okay

5625.0 --> 5628.32
the U.N what

5642.76 --> 5649.2390000000005
could be our reflection in the lands of

5645.88 --> 5650.139
God's mic okay good working bunny gummy

5649.239 --> 5652.9
bear

5650.139 --> 5655.42
this is

5652.9 --> 5657.28
yeah I mean

5655.42 --> 5659.26
I've never said that I think it's

5657.28 --> 5663.639
absolutely impossible

5659.26 --> 5665.860000000001
that the moon might be a weird map

5663.639 --> 5669.1
of the entire Realm

5665.86 --> 5670.78
it's just that when you would entertain

5669.1 --> 5674.5
that idea

5670.78 --> 5677.38
it also becomes very or it should become

5674.5 --> 5679.6
very apparent to you very quickly

5677.38 --> 5681.1
that it's completely jumbled and

5679.6 --> 5683.139
distorted

5681.1 --> 5687.280000000001
right

5683.139 --> 5689.139
so this might be inspired

5687.28 --> 5691.179
on the moon map

5689.139 --> 5692.62
which would make it an artistic

5691.179 --> 5694.96
interpretation

5692.62 --> 5697.9
or it might be something else I don't

5694.96 --> 5702.179
know I don't know I don't know

5697.9 --> 5702.179
I basically just bumped into this today

5707.56 --> 5710.280000000001
what's that

5716.08 --> 5720.88
Twitter

5717.88 --> 5720.88
foreign

5725.92 --> 5729.719
how is this a higher resolution

5731.26 --> 5737.639
it's

5732.9 --> 5737.638999999999
literally the exact same resolution

5743.92 --> 5749.9400000000005
now I'm gonna need like a 180

5747.82 --> 5749.94
p

5750.239 --> 5754.379999999999
type visual of this

5759.46 --> 5762.58
because yeah you just can't read the

5761.739 --> 5765.218999999999
text

5762.58 --> 5768.42
which by the way the text seems to be

5765.219 --> 5768.42
all hand written

5768.88 --> 5775.2390000000005
aren't you seeing that I mean this is

5771.159 --> 5777.219
not like a a printed

5775.239 --> 5780.0599999999995
book this seems to be completely

5777.219 --> 5780.06
handwritten

5784.12 --> 5788.28
second image is closer is it though

5788.5 --> 5791.159
foreign

5799.12 --> 5803.76
yeah the second name is that's only a

5801.28 --> 5803.759999999999
small part

5811.9 --> 5814.9
Oscar

5815.62 --> 5820.54
noise

5817.199 --> 5822.4
is in there

5820.54 --> 5824.8
huh

5822.4 --> 5827.138999999999
that's just this tiny little end

5824.8 --> 5829.0
and according to this map it's below

5827.139 --> 5832.4800000000005
Africa I thought it was directly

5829.0 --> 5835.0
connected to Argentina so that's a bit

5832.48 --> 5837.419999999999
weird Argentina is completely on the

5835.0 --> 5837.42
other side

5840.28 --> 5844.62
interesting but very odd

5847.98 --> 5853.36
right anyway if somebody can find a

5851.08 --> 5856.78
super high resolution version on which

5853.36 --> 5858.4
you can actually like scroll in zoom in

5856.78 --> 5860.679
on the

5858.4 --> 5863.92
yeah on the text and then be able to

5860.679 --> 5867.46
read it please please send me that

5863.92 --> 5868.78
version over the email just see if you

5867.46 --> 5870.639
can find it and send me through email

5868.78 --> 5873.28
that would be great

5870.639 --> 5875.32
I'm not super in a hurry about it but if

5873.28 --> 5877.3
you just bump into it I would really

5875.32 --> 5879.54
appreciate it if you email me that

5877.3 --> 5879.54
picture

5884.44 --> 5888.36
looks like written in German yeah yeah

5899.139 --> 5902.04
foreign

5907.57 --> 5915.619
[Music]

5920.679 --> 5924.9400000000005
but I certainly would like to see the

5922.719 --> 5927.82
other neuschwaben Lunt

5924.94 --> 5929.739
map and compare it

5927.82 --> 5931.9
because there's a much bigger map of

5929.739 --> 5934.299999999999
that

5931.9 --> 5937.138999999999
I'm curious let's see if I still if I

5934.3 --> 5937.139
downloaded that one

5939.4 --> 5944.679
the map of London

5943.06 --> 5948.120000000001
because that would be pretty cool to

5944.679 --> 5948.12
compare to this thing

5963.28 --> 5965.28
um

5966.34 --> 5972.179
damn it

5967.78 --> 5972.179
where is it I thought I had it

5980.08 --> 5984.88
well I guess I don't have it then boo

5985.38 --> 5991.179
oh man I should have just

5989.139 --> 5992.92
saved every freaking thing that they've

5991.179 --> 5996.78
ever come across

5992.92 --> 5996.78
but I didn't a lot of the time

6014.1 --> 6019.08
okay well maybe somebody's seen that

6017.159 --> 6022.679
other one

6019.08 --> 6025.739
right as a full-on zoom in fully

6022.679 --> 6028.26
detailed map of neuschwabena has anybody

6025.739 --> 6031.739
ever seen that right if you compare that

6028.26 --> 6033.02
to this map noise it's just this tiny

6031.739 --> 6034.5599999999995
little

6033.02 --> 6037.26
Islands

6034.56 --> 6040.7390000000005
which is I don't know as big as England

6037.26 --> 6043.08
or something or Great Britain

6040.739 --> 6046.339999999999
the islands right together maybe as big

6043.08 --> 6050.12
as that but just this tiny little thing

6046.34 --> 6050.12
compared to all the rest

6060.48 --> 6063.48
bro

6066.48 --> 6069.48
foreign

6085.32 --> 6088.4
there it is

6091.44 --> 6096.36
oh wait no

6094.26 --> 6099.4800000000005
well it's hard to tell

6096.36 --> 6102.239
no but the noise schwabenland looks as

6099.48 --> 6105.299999999999
big as rather is like as big as

6102.239 --> 6108.178999999999
Australia so that yes little bigger than

6105.3 --> 6110.1
the British Isles

6108.179 --> 6113.719
yeah

6110.1 --> 6113.719
that's still pretty freaking big

6130.02 --> 6135.860000000001
gotta get back to work okay see you

6132.06 --> 6135.860000000001
later Orinoco one more good to have you

6136.02 --> 6138.1990000000005
foreign

6143.03 --> 6146.679999999999
[Music]

6149.96 --> 6163.339
[Music]

6166.4 --> 6175.259999999999
45 I mean 15 minutes more to go

6171.84 --> 6177.56
certainly been a very energetic show

6175.26 --> 6177.56
today

6187.5 --> 6191.36
I hope you all enjoyed it at least

6205.44 --> 6207.678999999999
foreign

6226.85 --> 6233.329000000001
[Music]

6236.88 --> 6239.42
thank you

6241.94 --> 6249.299999999999
potential new map yeah yeah the map was

6246.179 --> 6250.619
a just a bonus I literally it it just

6249.3 --> 6254.84
got posted

6250.619 --> 6254.839999999999
by healthy apple and like uh

6259.02 --> 6263.96
yeah quite literally during my show

6264.42 --> 6269.159
in the middle of when I was still

6266.1 --> 6272.54
ranting about the FED situation he

6269.159 --> 6272.54
posted that and then

6273.179 --> 6277.8
at the second hour mark I pretty much

6275.82 --> 6280.199
discovered it and

6277.8 --> 6283.08
shared it with you guys but yeah I think

6280.199 --> 6286.678999999999
it's really interesting

6283.08 --> 6290.719
no guarantee that it's real but it is

6286.679 --> 6290.719
certainly worth figuring it out

6290.84 --> 6295.02
[Music]

6292.26 --> 6297.54
and it looks real to me I mean it does

6295.02 --> 6299.46
it does actually look like that could be

6297.54 --> 6303.659
real and it

6299.46 --> 6307.139
I know I can't really give you more

6303.659 --> 6310.199
as to why I feel bad about it

6307.139 --> 6311.88
is just intuition it's just having seen

6310.199 --> 6316.08
so many freaking maps and having

6311.88 --> 6319.619
attempted to create Maps myself

6316.08 --> 6321.659
in various degrees of quality from

6319.619 --> 6324.36
really primitive not really know what

6321.659 --> 6326.699
I'm doing to having a pretty good feel

6324.36 --> 6329.7699999999995
of it eventually

6326.699 --> 6331.98
right I've shown you a lot of maps

6329.77 --> 6334.56
[Music]

6331.98 --> 6335.94
so

6334.56 --> 6339.2390000000005
[Music]

6335.94 --> 6342.9
there's a lot of some yeah yes I know

6339.239 --> 6344.82
well isn't it even said right staz

6342.9 --> 6346.679
Moretz that

6344.82 --> 6348.36
the Americans basically went to

6346.679 --> 6350.639
Antarctica

6348.36 --> 6352.86
and then they didn't come back and it's

6350.639 --> 6355.02
alleged that they went after the Nazi

6352.86 --> 6356.639
basis

6355.02 --> 6358.9800000000005
isn't it

6356.639 --> 6359.86
like almost common

6358.98 --> 6363.299999999999
lore now

6359.86 --> 6366.42
[Music]

6363.3 --> 6368.639
so yeah that to me that doesn't mean

6366.42 --> 6372.659
like oh well maths eBay that means it

6368.639 --> 6374.28
must be fiction no no I think there's a

6372.659 --> 6375.839999999999
there's a chance that that really

6374.28 --> 6376.7
happened

6375.84 --> 6384.51
mate

6376.7 --> 6384.51
[Music]

6385.86 --> 6390.719
missed most of it it was finishing Jim

6388.38 --> 6394.9800000000005
Bob's geometry history

6390.719 --> 6394.9800000000005
now you can't have kids oh

6397.5 --> 6402.84
yeah just try to avoid game matria and

6400.739 --> 6404.959999999999
and you'll be fine

6402.84 --> 6404.96
okay

6407.76 --> 6414.08
right I mean numbers geometry is just

6410.82 --> 6414.08
another form of escapism

6414.6 --> 6418.869000000001
right

6415.6 --> 6418.869000000001
[Music]

6426.6 --> 6432.42
you've noted it because so that yeah

6429.239 --> 6433.919999999999
well there's like well

6432.42 --> 6436.5
yeah

6433.92 --> 6438.179
they will not see swastika symbols in

6436.5 --> 6440.219
there so yeah that does kind of stand

6438.179 --> 6443.78
out

6440.219 --> 6443.78
at least in the zoomed in version

6446.68 --> 6450.259
[Music]

6454.199 --> 6460.159
Nathan might be skipping a show today

6457.56 --> 6460.159000000001
typical

6462.659 --> 6467.099999999999
and a waste because hey his computer is

6465.06 --> 6471.659000000001
working all great

6467.1 --> 6472.9800000000005
you know as I called as I predicted by

6471.659 --> 6475.08
the way

6472.98 --> 6477.419999999999
now he of course did all the work to

6475.08 --> 6479.699
actually get it to work

6477.42 --> 6482.52
what I did give him is our my Iranian

6479.699 --> 6484.98
guarantee on Monday after he figured out

6482.52 --> 6486.42
that he had to update the chips

6484.98 --> 6488.699
chipset

6486.42 --> 6490.38
then I gave him my Iranian guarantee

6488.699 --> 6492.839999999999
like there's no more bucks it's gonna go

6490.38 --> 6495.84
super smooth now

6492.84 --> 6498.119000000001
and it did yesterday's fvd was super

6495.84 --> 6501.0
smooth there was no issues

6498.119 --> 6503.839999999999
except for social

6501.0 --> 6503.84
but yeah

6505.5 --> 6510.239
we'll see I don't even know if I'm gonna

6507.84 --> 6512.34
go on today if he would go live I might

6510.239 --> 6515.54
just hang around in chat and get a

6512.34 --> 6515.54
little skanky again

6516.179 --> 6521.46
we'll see but I am gonna go out for

6518.58 --> 6523.44
groceries nonetheless

6521.46 --> 6525.2390000000005
it's gonna be nice weather although

6523.44 --> 6526.5599999999995
there's some clouds arriving I don't

6525.239 --> 6531.259999999999
know what to think about that they're

6526.56 --> 6534.780000000001
not particularly ominous or anything but

6531.26 --> 6539.88
I want my son

6534.78 --> 6539.88
oh oh almost forget forgot

6540.3 --> 6546.3
yeah I actually wanted to bring up

6543.36 --> 6548.339999999999
Narnia again

6546.3 --> 6550.860000000001
because I watched the second movie

6548.34 --> 6554.78
yesterday

6550.86 --> 6559.199
and holy [ __ ]

6554.78 --> 6561.42
holy [ __ ] that was one of the best

6559.199 --> 6564.78
like medieval

6561.42 --> 6566.88
style fantasy combat movies that I've

6564.78 --> 6570.32
probably ever seen

6566.88 --> 6570.32
like ever

6570.42 --> 6572.9
was

6573.179 --> 6578.659
sift different

6575.0 --> 6581.94
massive difference from the first one

6578.659 --> 6584.94
massive I was really impressed I mean

6581.94 --> 6585.9
that was a great movie that that that's

6584.94 --> 6588.96
like

6585.9 --> 6590.28
on par with like Lord of the Rings maybe

6588.96 --> 6592.8
even better

6590.28 --> 6594.599999999999
the second one it might actually be

6592.8 --> 6597.0
better than Lord of the Rings although

6594.6 --> 6599.219
yeah of course the total story and the

6597.0 --> 6601.02
background lore Lord of the Rings is

6599.219 --> 6606.42
undeniably awesome

6601.02 --> 6608.96
I will never put it down like that but I

6606.42 --> 6611.88
was really impressed by the second

6608.96 --> 6614.699
Narnia movie

6611.88 --> 6616.5
Narnia movie the second Narnia movie the

6614.699 --> 6618.48
second Narnia movie I mean come on how

6616.5 --> 6620.94
many times

6618.48 --> 6623.299999999999
do I need to say it the second Narnia

6620.94 --> 6623.299999999999
movie

6625.08 --> 6631.38
the second Narnia movie is like three

6628.5 --> 6633.8
times as good as the first one

6631.38 --> 6637.26
it really is

6633.8 --> 6640.320000000001
holy [ __ ] like everything about that

6637.26 --> 6642.900000000001
movie was awesome the opponents were

6640.32 --> 6645.299999999999
awesome the characters were awesome the

6642.9 --> 6647.82
characters were believable this time

6645.3 --> 6650.04
they had a whole lifetime of being kings

6647.82 --> 6653.099999999999
and queens as an experience now to back

6650.04 --> 6654.6
up what they were doing it was much more

6653.1 --> 6657.54
believable

6654.6 --> 6659.46
and the opponent holy [ __ ] it was like a

6657.54 --> 6661.32
Spanish Empire

6659.46 --> 6664.38
that was there

6661.32 --> 6666.659
and that King oh my God that was like

6664.38 --> 6669.6
the most badass

6666.659 --> 6673.679
Spanish King

6669.6 --> 6674.76
it was like I I was so impressed by the

6673.679 --> 6678.38
whole thing

6674.76 --> 6678.38
it was amazing

6678.8 --> 6684.900000000001
very very impressed by this movie and at

6682.739 --> 6685.98
this one I'm gonna watch re-watch in the

6684.9 --> 6688.138999999999
future

6685.98 --> 6691.32
you've only seen the first one oh my God

6688.139 --> 6695.719
you've missed out man that second one is

6691.32 --> 6695.719
three times as good as the first one

6695.82 --> 6700.08
it's

6697.26 --> 6702.96
amazing

6700.08 --> 6705.119
dare I say I liked it more than the

6702.96 --> 6707.94
second Lord of the Rings movie

6705.119 --> 6709.799999999999
it's that good

6707.94 --> 6711.839999999999
the basic storyline which in the

6709.8 --> 6713.820000000001
wardrobe yeah I know I did not care for

6711.84 --> 6716.04
it too much that first movie I did not

6713.82 --> 6717.78
like it it was just too much wrong with

6716.04 --> 6720.9
it it was too

6717.78 --> 6724.159
mixed as in oh it's too much Kitty [ __ ]

6720.9 --> 6729.0599999999995
but then really brutal adult as well no

6724.159 --> 6730.32
wrong bad game master bad I did not like

6729.06 --> 6732.780000000001
it at all

6730.32 --> 6735.44
there were some interesting Parts but I

6732.78 --> 6737.4
did not like it the second one freaking

6735.44 --> 6740.299999999999
awesome man

6737.4 --> 6740.299999999999
watch it

6740.639 --> 6745.6990000000005
is the second one when they go home no

6747.48 --> 6752.339999999999
or maybe I don't know it's just all

6750.78 --> 6755.28
Narnia they're in the train station

6752.34 --> 6757.619000000001
certainly they phase out into Narnia and

6755.28 --> 6758.88
then in the end they go through a portal

6757.619 --> 6760.86
and they face back into the train

6758.88 --> 6764.4800000000005
station so where they're really at in

6760.86 --> 6764.48
the real world that just doesn't matter

6764.639 --> 6769.9800000000005
but what actually happens in that movie

6767.88 --> 6774.0
and what they do it's

6769.98 --> 6776.759999999999
really good I loved the second movie

6774.0 --> 6778.619
it was so much better than the first one

6776.76 --> 6780.900000000001
incredible

6778.619 --> 6783.54
and I'm watching the third one already a

6780.9 --> 6786.42
bit it's probably not as good there's

6783.54 --> 6788.82
issues with it it seems like it doesn't

6786.42 --> 6791.82
have the power as the first one although

6788.82 --> 6793.92
there's like this weirdo extra character

6791.82 --> 6796.5599999999995
British guy that kind of slipped in with

6793.92 --> 6799.1990000000005
them I think he is kind of funny and

6796.56 --> 6801.84
then Super annoying too but anyway the

6799.199 --> 6805.32
second movie is really one of the best

6801.84 --> 6807.0
movies in the fantasy and War genre that

6805.32 --> 6810.42
I've ever seen

6807.0 --> 6813.54
I think it was really impressive it was

6810.42 --> 6816.719
like it made me want to like I want to

6813.54 --> 6818.699
do this as a game master I wanna I wanna

6816.719 --> 6821.04
play this out with players

6818.699 --> 6822.839999999999
and on both sides right because both

6821.04 --> 6826.739
sides were cool

6822.84 --> 6830.6990000000005
they all it was like real but it wasn't

6826.739 --> 6832.86
like the e ve one no they were just like

6830.699 --> 6836.36
humans trying to survive in a very human

6832.86 --> 6839.339999999999
way against well the weird Narnia world

6836.36 --> 6843.119
with corruption issues but it was all

6839.34 --> 6844.26
reasonable it I really really love this

6843.119 --> 6846.54
movie

6844.26 --> 6848.280000000001
it might be the best movie that I've

6846.54 --> 6850.32
seen like

6848.28 --> 6852.3
in a long time

6850.32 --> 6854.219
in the genre

6852.3 --> 6856.26
maybe the best ever I don't know I'd

6854.219 --> 6858.6
have to see it a second time to make up

6856.26 --> 6861.2390000000005
my mind and still like freshly Blown

6858.6 --> 6864.3
Away by it

6861.239 --> 6866.459999999999
all right so watch watch it it's really

6864.3 --> 6868.619000000001
good if you only saw the the first one

6866.46 --> 6870.4800000000005
you're gonna be in for a treat

6868.619 --> 6873.36
it's like everything that was shitty

6870.48 --> 6875.459999999999
about the first one this one totally

6873.36 --> 6878.239
makes all right

6875.46 --> 6878.2390000000005
totally

6879.659 --> 6884.0
uh

6881.28 --> 6884.0
it's the second one

6884.52 --> 6889.4400000000005
Prince Caspian

6886.38 --> 6890.6990000000005
I know I also like Prince Caspian as a

6889.44 --> 6893.28
character

6890.699 --> 6896.339999999999
he was like a basically yeah I don't

6893.28 --> 6898.619
want to spoil too much I just I liked

6896.34 --> 6901.139
all the characters in it they were all

6898.619 --> 6903.96
reasonable good and they developed and

6901.139 --> 6906.659000000001
it was just great I love this movie

6903.96 --> 6910.86
so watch it watch Chronicles of Narnia

6906.659 --> 6913.44
Prince Caspian is really good I loved it

6910.86 --> 6915.839999999999
I loved a lot about it

6913.44 --> 6917.58
and the third one I've not threw it yet

6915.84 --> 6920.639
I don't know it's probably not as good

6917.58 --> 6923.1
as the first as the second one but

6920.639 --> 6926.34
I don't know we'll see

6923.1 --> 6928.4400000000005
anyway I still want yeah I had to

6926.34 --> 6930.659000000001
squeeze that one in maybe I'll talk more

6928.44 --> 6933.0
elaborately about it

6930.659 --> 6933.98
in like the next show

6933.0 --> 6935.78
but uh

6933.98 --> 6939.78
[Music]

6935.78 --> 6942.659
watch the second one it's good

6939.78 --> 6946.0199999999995
how do we have to watch the first one

6942.659 --> 6948.86
yeah you do have to watch the first one

6946.02 --> 6952.1990000000005
it's basically chapter two but it's much

6948.86 --> 6955.139
better written chapter and it explains

6952.199 --> 6959.46
it also expounds upon the lore of how it

6955.139 --> 6961.679
works you could technically watch it

6959.46 --> 6965.82
like it's the first time you're in

6961.679 --> 6967.9800000000005
Narnia but it does really help you get

6965.82 --> 6970.619
into it more if you have at least

6967.98 --> 6972.78
watched the first movie Once even though

6970.619 --> 6975.139
that one is not super great in my

6972.78 --> 6975.139
opinion

6979.26 --> 6983.52
I'm gonna do that okay PJ Christian girl

6981.6 --> 6986.280000000001
you're gonna be in for a treat with the

6983.52 --> 6988.38
second movie the first one yeah

6986.28 --> 6990.239
maybe you'll really like it maybe you'll

6988.38 --> 6993.6
be like totally turned off by some

6990.239 --> 6996.0
ridiculous fantasy type choices in the

6993.6 --> 6997.4400000000005
first one I did not like it it was

6996.0 --> 6999.6
disturbing to me

6997.44 --> 7001.4
like the way they dealt with it I mean

6999.6 --> 7003.4400000000005
the universe was awesome the graphics

7001.4 --> 7005.54
were awesome the music were awesome it's

7003.44 --> 7008.299999999999
just that the story the game master just

7005.54 --> 7009.58
sucked in the first one it was like it

7008.3 --> 7012.38
felt too

7009.58 --> 7014.98
nonsensical in ways

7012.38 --> 7014.9800000000005
the second one

7015.32 --> 7022.4
had no issues with it at all like none

7020.0 --> 7024.86
no issues

7022.4 --> 7027.379999999999
and that's pretty special

7024.86 --> 7029.32
if Arwin does not have any issues with

7027.38 --> 7034.159000000001
the movie that's special

7029.32 --> 7038.679
I liked it I liked the second one a lot

7034.159 --> 7038.679
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

7038.84 --> 7042.860000000001
it seems like Nathan is having a show

7040.52 --> 7045.139
