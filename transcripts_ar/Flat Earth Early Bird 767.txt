yeah there's not a lot of sun coming

90.32 --> 95.52
through

92.24 --> 99.03999999999999
at all and it's kind of

95.52 --> 103.439
yeah it's it's cold also

99.04 --> 115.36000000000001
kind of wet wet and cold outside

103.439 --> 117.91999999999999
definitely not wind still

115.36 --> 120.159
yeah not very interesting weather out

117.92 --> 120.159
there

121.6 --> 129.84
all right so it's the 4th of january

126.84 --> 129.84
2021

130.239 --> 136.0
let's see who's in chat tara306 is first

133.76 --> 143.12
definitely first

136.0 --> 147.04
huh good to see you

143.12 --> 147.04
right so are we all doing

152.16 --> 158.48
let's see yeah went to bed

156.0 --> 160.48
pretty early yesterday for my doing i

158.48 --> 163.599
just felt i needed the extra sleep

160.48 --> 170.16
and i well i did slept pretty much

163.599 --> 173.04
a solid 10 hours

170.16 --> 173.04
here we go again

175.68 --> 178.0
yep

180.64 --> 185.35999999999999
almost felt like sleeping even more than

183.2 --> 187.92
10 hours so i don't know i

185.36 --> 190.48000000000002
feel like i got some catching up to do

187.92 --> 194.39999999999998
for some reason

190.48 --> 195.599
uh maybe it's also because i'm at the

194.4 --> 199.28
end of this

195.599 --> 203.44
sort of cold cycle that i had of which

199.28 --> 206.72
was now two days ago i had some symptoms

203.44 --> 209.84
and then kind of went away and

206.72 --> 213.04
it's like the it's getting

209.84 --> 214.959
rounded out as it were in my body so

213.04 --> 216.72
that's just something i'm noticing and i

214.959 --> 219.12
guess that's probably the cause why i

216.72 --> 227.84
need some extra sleep

219.12 --> 227.84
hey todd wassel good to see you

228.44 --> 232.239
accidentally today

239.599 --> 246.64
okay right

243.28 --> 248.72
but yesterday uh show was pretty fluid

246.64 --> 250.23899999999998
didn't watch it back i don't know why

248.72 --> 255.84
maybe it's because i'm just not in the

250.239 --> 255.84
mood for it

256.72 --> 260.32000000000005
don't have a lot of specific subjects

258.799 --> 262.23999999999995
these days

260.32 --> 263.44
although you have a lot of generalized

262.24 --> 266.479
thought generalized

263.44 --> 268.639
very generalized and

266.479 --> 270.71999999999997
i don't know maybe also has to do with

268.639 --> 274.56
owen benjamin because

270.72 --> 277.759
he's kind of like doing the same

274.56 --> 283.84
thing in his own way

277.759 --> 287.199
he's much more fluid about it though

283.84 --> 291.28
stoned squirrels

287.199 --> 294.0
oh it's just that one scroll and

291.28 --> 294.0
it's yeah

294.32 --> 298.24
i've seen squirrels do that even before

296.32 --> 300.15999999999997
so it's not like the only video in which

298.24 --> 302.639
i saw something like that

300.16 --> 304.24
like scrolls can get in a really deep

302.639 --> 305.919
deep trance

304.24 --> 307.919
and then they just stop noticing

305.919 --> 311.44
everything

307.919 --> 314.08
i think only heavy sharp sounds can snap

311.44 --> 314.08
them out of it

316.56 --> 320.8
yeah it's weird isn't it yeah but that

319.199 --> 323.68
was from the

320.8 --> 324.639
aussie man reviews video relaxing

323.68 --> 339.84000000000003
animals

324.639 --> 339.84000000000003
it was a funny video

347.28 --> 352.88
right anyway uh

350.4 --> 355.35999999999996
went to a bit of uh bible literalists

352.88 --> 358.0
hang out yesterday

355.36 --> 361.68
but then yeah eventually owen benjamin

358.0 --> 361.68
started up and they kind of switched

363.12 --> 367.919
i also noticed that good servant was

365.44 --> 371.759
hanging around there over at paulus

367.919 --> 371.75899999999996
so that was kind of odd

377.039 --> 381.199
i don't know exactly what he was doing

379.68 --> 383.68
or what he is doing

381.199 --> 386.08000000000004
but yeah that's like i just noticed he

383.68 --> 388.0
was there

386.08 --> 390.31899999999996
right i have no idea what he's doing

388.0 --> 395.84
really if he's even still on that show

390.319 --> 395.84000000000003
with tony

397.84 --> 402.0
right anyway did that

402.639 --> 409.84000000000003
he was in ball busters wasn't he what

420.319 --> 427.599
wait wait what who are you talking about

423.52 --> 427.599
terri or i mean here we go again

428.56 --> 432.88
now good serpent's never been on ball

430.56 --> 435.759
busters or

432.88 --> 438.56
fed he's been on my show before and he

435.759 --> 438.56
has his own show

439.52 --> 444.0
or he used to with that guy called tom

442.96 --> 447.599
parker

444.0 --> 447.599
i don't know if he still does his own

448.84 --> 454.4
streams

450.88 --> 457.599
you have seen him in the chat there is

454.4 --> 460.88
yes oh

457.599 --> 465.68
in in ball busters and everything oh i

460.88 --> 479.599
didn't know

465.68 --> 483.12
i haven't noticed that

479.599 --> 486.4
will we see a day where if he behaved

483.12 --> 489.36
as globies and globies as f ears

486.4 --> 493.84
a role reversal come on you've been

489.36 --> 493.84000000000003
watching too much science fiction

495.199 --> 499.44
that typically happens in science

497.36 --> 503.28000000000003
fiction series and all that

499.44 --> 506.479
of the cheaper sort this

503.28 --> 510.87899999999996
kids series

506.479 --> 513.5989999999999
but no the only way i could

510.879 --> 514.9590000000001
roughly conceive of that happening

513.599 --> 518.0
sometime

514.959 --> 518.959
is if i don't know government would

518.0 --> 522.56
suddenly just

518.959 --> 526.399
discard the globe model and start to

522.56 --> 530.7199999999999
refine yeah the specific

526.399 --> 534.08
reified disc domed model

530.72 --> 534.5600000000001
all of a sudden then maybe like the

534.08 --> 536.399
roles

534.56 --> 538.7199999999999
would get reversed maybe that would

536.399 --> 538.72
happen

539.44 --> 545.6
because of just the shift of focus

542.48 --> 548.08
and that yeah the role change

545.6 --> 550.88
that would come from it so maybe that

548.08 --> 550.88
would happen but

552.64 --> 560.16
i don't know it's the problem is is that

556.88 --> 563.36
the ball model is just what it is

560.16 --> 565.04
so it doesn't even by that yeah by that

563.36 --> 568.64
sense

565.04 --> 571.4399999999999
matter what the role is

568.64 --> 572.3199999999999
if they are book consensus through

571.44 --> 575.839
government or

572.32 --> 577.36
if they are separatists rebels against

575.839 --> 579.2
the government it doesn't really matter

577.36 --> 582.72
because their ball model just

579.2 --> 582.72
is broken it is what it is

584.48 --> 591.839
karumpus would still get tea back

597.68 --> 604.399
hey fireside conspiracy chat

600.88 --> 618.16
hello welcome to this chat

604.399 --> 621.76
zack sterling welcome back

618.16 --> 623.76
oh reality our reality is based on

621.76 --> 624.959
models we live in la la land well please

623.76 --> 633.8389999999999
speak for yourself

624.959 --> 633.8389999999999
i don't i don't live in models

643.04 --> 648.48
the guy you guys talk about every day

648.56 --> 657.92
the guy who do we talk about every day

653.92 --> 659.5999999999999
you mean rumpus the baller

657.92 --> 675.8389999999999
good servant i don't talk about good

659.6 --> 675.839
serving every day

687.839 --> 692.1600000000001
zack who are you talking about

695.279 --> 702.24
you mean the good servant well he's

699.6 --> 705.2
before and he's mostly done just

702.24 --> 708.24
christian related stuff

705.2 --> 712.48
he is a flat earther

708.24 --> 714.399
but he never really gets into any

712.48 --> 714.8000000000001
technicals about i've never heard him do

714.399 --> 718.56
that

714.8 --> 721.1999999999999
it's not really his thing

718.56 --> 730.66
so he's always been fixated on

721.2 --> 733.88
christianity and all that

730.66 --> 733.88
[Music]

735.92 --> 739.12
all right let's get some tea

739.2 --> 745.839
man it's cold it's also this

742.839 --> 745.839
door

748.639 --> 754.399
more like that it's really cold out

756.839 --> 759.839
there

763.92 --> 769.8389999999999
right is anybody else having issues with

767.36 --> 771.6800000000001
youtube stalling on them because it

769.839 --> 774.48
stalls on me a lot

771.68 --> 777.279
and but if it's stalling on you then yes

774.48 --> 777.279
because of that

777.6 --> 781.279
there will be a delay when i directly

780.56 --> 784.4799999999999
ask

781.279 --> 786.399
questions to chat and that could turn

784.48 --> 788.0
into a big delay so that is kind of a

786.399 --> 791.76
nuisance

788.0 --> 793.92
but i don't know if others are

791.76 --> 796.0
experiencing that problem i am with my

793.92 --> 797.4399999999999
own videos but it's usually of my own

796.0 --> 801.44
videos only

797.44 --> 803.44
so which is really odd by the way

801.44 --> 804.9590000000001
because if others are not experiencing

803.44 --> 807.6
it then i don't

804.959 --> 810.0
understand the reason why i would be

807.6 --> 812.32
experiencing it

810.0 --> 813.44
and only ever with my own videos even

812.32 --> 816.0
though i'm just

813.44 --> 817.9200000000001
interfacing with it on youtube as a

816.0 --> 829.839
regular

817.92 --> 829.8389999999999
it's weird

831.12 --> 834.24
ah fire fights fireside conspiracy chat

833.92 --> 836.88
where

834.24 --> 839.36
are you at i take it you're in the north

836.88 --> 842.56
as well somewhere

839.36 --> 845.6800000000001
north side of the realm

842.56 --> 845.68
hey hello samson

848.639 --> 853.12
yeah i was a little bit yeah samson good

851.76 --> 855.68
to see you in chat

853.12 --> 858.72
because yesterday bible literalist was

855.68 --> 863.68
like really going after this

858.72 --> 864.24
uh ah now i forget the full name it was

863.68 --> 867.8389999999999
a

864.24 --> 870.32
hebrew something group

867.839 --> 872.48
but like from what she described they

870.32 --> 873.839
were like a bunch of cervantes and there

872.48 --> 875.76
are all kinds of issues but i was

873.839 --> 879.44
wondering if it was the same

875.76 --> 883.8389999999999
group as yeah as your

879.44 --> 888.1600000000001
as what you do samson i'm not

883.839 --> 888.1600000000001
might have been another version

890.24 --> 899.839
right try to find it back

893.76 --> 899.8389999999999
see what she did spell it out

904.639 --> 908.0790000000001
no it's not in the title

909.76 --> 918.639
no samson just know

913.279 --> 918.639
so it's not the same thing i thought so

919.199 --> 922.8
or rather i had hoped so because

921.04 --> 927.8389999999999
everything she described i did not

922.8 --> 927.8389999999999
notice any of that from you so far

940.16 --> 944.0
no i get that samson i know you're not

942.56 --> 947.5999999999999
you are solitary

944.0 --> 949.199
like that i get that of course

947.6 --> 951.44
but i was just wondering if it was

949.199 --> 952.8
completely eclectic or that you did get

951.44 --> 957.2790000000001
into contact with

952.8 --> 960.8
a group that basically

957.279 --> 968.16
inspired you to follow

960.8 --> 970.24
yeah this specific tradition as well

968.16 --> 971.4399999999999
just wondering basically if that group

970.24 --> 974.5600000000001
she's talking about

971.44 --> 977.9200000000001
if it has some kind of

974.56 --> 978.959
relation to your specific faith that is

977.92 --> 980.88
all doesn't mean that

978.959 --> 982.0
you act like that i just was wondering

980.88 --> 984.32
if there is a connection

982.0 --> 984.32
at all

985.759 --> 989.519
i seen her video come up yesterday

990.88 --> 994.88
okay that's thanks because i was really

994.24 --> 998.16
curious

994.88 --> 999.279
if it is the same but then again there

998.16 --> 1002.24
might be

999.279 --> 1002.639
various religious groups out there that

1002.24 --> 1008.9590000000001
have

1002.639 --> 1012.639
hebrew in them hebrew is very popular

1008.959 --> 1014.3199999999999
for yeah new types of groups

1012.639 --> 1016.0790000000001
out there religious groups people that

1014.32 --> 1018.48
are trying to be another

1016.079 --> 1020.2399999999999
like we're going to be the right form of

1018.48 --> 1025.839
christian

1020.24 --> 1025.839
there's a lot of that out there so

1027.36 --> 1030.6399999999999
but anyway yeah it would be good to know

1029.28 --> 1033.76
thanks for

1030.64 --> 1033.76
checking that out later

1037.679 --> 1045.2800000000002

1041.28 --> 1045.28

1053.6 --> 1055.84

warmer there in the south southern half

1063.44 --> 1067.8400000000001

more careful right now to tell me that

1176.559 --> 1182.48
a blue fruit i don't know what is a

1178.16 --> 1182.48
fringe is that an object

1190.08 --> 1193.84
is that like a ribbon or something

1204.4 --> 1208.3200000000002
it's in the old testament okay

1213.679 --> 1217.52
so yeah it's like

1217.679 --> 1221.52
special boy decoration basically it's

1219.84 --> 1223.6
like oh i'm a special boy

1221.52 --> 1225.28
book tells me i have to do this and then

1223.6 --> 1227.9299999999998
i'm a special voice sorry

1225.28 --> 1229.28
not to be too disrespectful

1227.93 --> 1232.88
[Music]

1229.28 --> 1232.8799999999999
but that is how it feels like to me

1232.96 --> 1236.32
the bottom of your clothes

1236.4 --> 1239.039
that's weird

1240.64 --> 1245.76
i've never well maybe i have actually

1243.28 --> 1249.28
noticed that because i have

1245.76 --> 1250.0
i have met dave murphy and he's a pretty

1249.28 --> 1253.84
cool guy

1250.0 --> 1257.36
like he is i wouldn't say like he's

1253.84 --> 1263.1999999999998
just nice but

1257.36 --> 1267.039
he is pretty wise and

1263.2 --> 1269.28
well he does yeah like there's

1267.039 --> 1272.1589999999999
there's something like pretty cool about

1269.28 --> 1272.1589999999999
him he's a pretty

1273.28 --> 1279.76
interesting guy

1277.6 --> 1280.799
it's just that that the whole fringe

1279.76 --> 1283.919
thing i've never

1280.799 --> 1283.9189999999999
noticed that before

1285.84 --> 1292.48
yeah three thi thinker well what's

1289.039 --> 1295.039
really stands out about him is that

1292.48 --> 1297.2
he doesn't just have like a mission to

1295.039 --> 1300.48
make sure that

1297.2 --> 1303.6000000000001
he's not influenced by the world

1300.48 --> 1306.72
it's just he's really there like this

1303.6 --> 1309.52
guy cannot be faced by anything

1306.72 --> 1310.159
like i really can't conceive of anything

1309.52 --> 1313.52
that would

1310.159 --> 1315.2800000000002
alter him or like in any kind of social

1313.52 --> 1317.039
energy type of way

1315.28 --> 1320.96
that's what really stood out to me like

1317.039 --> 1320.96
this guy is just really set

1321.6 --> 1327.6789999999999
in his way of doing things and he can

1324.32 --> 1331.36
also explain about it

1327.679 --> 1334.799
right and even that part sledgehammer

1331.36 --> 1336.0
like he doesn't give a [ __ ] about that

1334.799 --> 1339.52
the whole world

1336.0 --> 1341.52
thinks that that is whatever like he

1339.52 --> 1344.84
literally doesn't give a [ __ ] like

1341.52 --> 1348.1589999999999
really doesn't and not just as a

1344.84 --> 1361.1999999999998
defense an act no he just really doesn't

1348.159 --> 1364.159
give a [ __ ]

1361.2 --> 1364.799
and yeah absolutely there are things i

1364.159 --> 1375.8400000000001
and

1364.799 --> 1375.84
i even disagree on with what he thinks

1377.12 --> 1380.0
neither do i

1380.48 --> 1389.84
well if you did didn't give a [ __ ] then

1382.88 --> 1389.8400000000001
why would you even bring that up

1398.0 --> 1401.039
yeah that sledgehammer the thing is he

1400.4 --> 1406.4
doesn't

1401.039 --> 1411.28
just do it because he can

1406.4 --> 1414.48
now you don't need to hide that come on

1411.28 --> 1415.76
because it's true but there is a thing

1414.48 --> 1418.32
about it

1415.76 --> 1421.44
and it's well studied it's just never

1418.32 --> 1421.4399999999998
going to be popular

1423.039 --> 1431.84
that's why there is something about it

1428.0 --> 1431.84
it's not the first time i've heard it

1432.799 --> 1436.4
yeah and even back in the day there were

1435.2 --> 1438.559
a couple of

1436.4 --> 1439.8400000000001
well flat earthers there was also dave

1438.559 --> 1443.6
murphy

1439.84 --> 1448.24
that would like come out about that

1443.6 --> 1451.36
people have tried and yeah it's not

1448.24 --> 1454.4
it's i never liked that even

1451.36 --> 1457.279
way back way before flat earth i was

1454.4 --> 1458.88
confronted with it several times before

1457.279 --> 1462.0
as like a sort of medical

1458.88 --> 1463.0390000000002
application because there is something

1462.0 --> 1468.24
to it

1463.039 --> 1468.24
it can even be laboratorized

1469.12 --> 1474.32
and all that and it i think it's it

1472.159 --> 1476.88
even falls in a category of medical

1474.32 --> 1480.0
science seriously so

1476.88 --> 1483.279
there is something to it it's just

1480.0 --> 1487.84
never going to be popular

1483.279 --> 1487.84
you see

1490.159 --> 1504.96
and they don't see sledgehammer look

1501.36 --> 1507.1999999999998
you're just emphasizing the

1504.96 --> 1508.32
yeah the impulse that makes you feel

1507.2 --> 1511.44
like

1508.32 --> 1513.6
ridiculous when

1511.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
that's not the only thing that exists

1513.6 --> 1515.84
there

1524.08 --> 1531.6
and it isn't because there is a reason

1528.32 --> 1533.6789999999999
dave murphy does that now there is

1531.6 --> 1536.799
something to say for but oh maybe

1533.679 --> 1537.2
he doesn't do much or something but then

1536.799 --> 1539.36
again

1537.2 --> 1540.48
i've heard him discuss about it like

1539.36 --> 1541.9189999999999
face to face and said

1540.48 --> 1546.159
like during the amsterdam conference

1541.919 --> 1546.159
where i met him he talked about that

1546.559 --> 1551.279
and he says also that yeah he's paying a

1549.44 --> 1554.799
lot of attention to his diet

1551.279 --> 1557.919
specifically because he does that

1554.799 --> 1558.1589999999999
and yeah if you just randomly would do

1557.919 --> 1560.0
it

1558.159 --> 1563.3600000000001
with whatever you're eating and drinking

1560.0 --> 1566.64
yeah it could get pretty disgusting

1563.36 --> 1570.6399999999999
if you adapt your diet as it were

1566.64 --> 1573.6000000000001
to that then it's different it's just

1570.64 --> 1575.5200000000002
different so yeah very weird isn't it

1573.6 --> 1578.1589999999999
very weird

1575.52 --> 1579.44
it's so weird i get it i think it's

1578.159 --> 1581.44
weird too

1579.44 --> 1584.0
but doesn't mean that there it is just

1581.44 --> 1585.3600000000001
on that it is like a form of insanity or

1584.0 --> 1599.84
anything

1585.36 --> 1599.84
that's the mistake

1600.559 --> 1615.76
okay so now

1612.08 --> 1615.76
why would you need to well

1616.559 --> 1621.12
said to be there's like a whole

1618.96 --> 1622.32
transformation process that happens

1621.12 --> 1626.559
through the kidneys

1622.32 --> 1628.3999999999999
with compounds no not thirst stop

1626.559 --> 1631.44
stop [ __ ] around or i'm gonna start

1628.4 --> 1631.44
banning people okay

1631.52 --> 1637.44
i mean it this is not funny you get it

1635.44 --> 1639.6000000000001
and yeah trolls that'll come in i'll

1637.44 --> 1641.279
just ban you i'll just ban you all but i

1639.6 --> 1643.12
want everybody to stop

1641.279 --> 1644.72
trying to make fun of this it's not

1643.12 --> 1649.039
funny

1644.72 --> 1652.24
there's a reason for it okay

1649.039 --> 1655.84
it has to do with your immune system too

1652.24 --> 1655.84
it's that

1655.919 --> 1661.3600000000001
a lot of stuff that that you basically

1661.6 --> 1666.24
take on with your body is also just a

1664.96 --> 1669.3600000000001
lot of bacteria and

1666.24 --> 1673.1200000000001
all kinds of things and yeah

1669.36 --> 1674.6399999999999
through some process it just basically

1673.12 --> 1676.9599999999998
passes through your body and then

1674.64 --> 1680.24
eventually gets ejected in

1676.96 --> 1683.2
yeah your bladder a lot of it but the

1680.24 --> 1686.799
thing is is that

1683.2 --> 1689.919
sometimes like

1686.799 --> 1691.44
at the end there is like there is a

1689.919 --> 1694.72
value to basically

1691.44 --> 1696.96
re in take it because apparently the

1694.72 --> 1699.1200000000001
immune system does kind of work with

1696.96 --> 1701.279
i i don't fully understand but it

1699.12 --> 1705.4399999999998
literally

1701.279 --> 1708.559
helps your immune system

1705.44 --> 1712.159
and that's it that is what it is

1708.559 --> 1715.32
and also yeah but not necessarily

1712.159 --> 1718.3200000000002
good but also in certain type of

1715.32 --> 1718.32
hallucinogenics

1718.88 --> 1722.88
like certain mushrooms this is what i

1720.559 --> 1724.08
heard this is also like the reindeer

1722.88 --> 1727.2
piss and santa claus

1724.08 --> 1729.279
again right is that if you

1727.2 --> 1732.0800000000002
eat certain mushrooms and then you piss

1729.279 --> 1734.88
it out you barely notice anything of it

1732.08 --> 1737.4399999999998
until you drink the piss and then it is

1734.88 --> 1739.919
kind of transformed chemically

1737.44 --> 1740.88
to be better absorbable to be more

1739.919 --> 1744.64
effective yeah

1740.88 --> 1747.1200000000001
weird isn't it is real

1744.64 --> 1749.5200000000002
so there's that part and then there is

1747.12 --> 1752.2399999999998
the immune system

1749.52 --> 1753.36
effect where it can literally help you

1752.24 --> 1757.6
restore quicker

1753.36 --> 1760.7199999999998
it's just i don't know if you can call

1757.6 --> 1764.1589999999999
it medical science

1760.72 --> 1766.559
but there's at least a whole lot of

1764.159 --> 1769.679
people that believe in that and have

1766.559 --> 1771.44
lived by that so

1769.679 --> 1773.279
i'm not promoting anything i'm just

1771.44 --> 1777.1200000000001
trying to be honest about it

1773.279 --> 1780.64
and preventing people from squirting

1777.12 --> 1782.7199999999998
for no good reason

1780.64 --> 1784.3200000000002
also to point out that yeah people out

1782.72 --> 1786.799
there do that not to

1784.32 --> 1787.6789999999999
seem silly not as some controlled

1786.799 --> 1790.799
opposition

1787.679 --> 1796.3200000000002
decision no

1790.799 --> 1796.32
it is there for a reason

1797.2 --> 1805.76
they don't do it just to seem crazy

1800.24 --> 1805.76
you see it's kind of good to realize

1806.84 --> 1809.84
that

1845.12 --> 1849.84
kind of nasty subject well it can become

1847.84 --> 1851.6
nasty if everybody starts squirting

1849.84 --> 1855.84
about it

1851.6 --> 1856.399
because it's so funny oh let's equate it

1855.84 --> 1859.519
with

1856.399 --> 1865.84
with poo yeah no

1859.519 --> 1865.84
it's not the same

1871.84 --> 1875.4399999999998
well slash hammer you can stop now or

1874.159 --> 1876.7990000000002
i'm gonna ban you

1875.44 --> 1880.3990000000001
because she's getting really on my

1876.799 --> 1880.399
nerves it's not funny anymore

1882.0 --> 1885.36
yeah it's really cute

1885.679 --> 1893.8400000000001
you can stop it now

1918.84 --> 1935.84
what are you talking about

1946.84 --> 1949.84
fruitarianism

1968.72 --> 1974.559
uh right yeah

1971.919 --> 1976.64
well ryan just a lot of people in

1974.559 --> 1979.039
beginning of january tend to have those

1976.64 --> 1979.039
moments

1985.919 --> 1991.8400000000001
it'll be all right

1992.159 --> 2005.8400000000001
all right

2019.2 --> 2022.3990000000001
i don't know who that is

2022.64 --> 2025.44
sledgehammer

2031.6 --> 2047.84
hey where are you going todd wuzzle

2050.399 --> 2054.3199999999997
oh wait i think i mixed you up with ryan

2052.96 --> 2061.839
earth

2054.32 --> 2061.839
you're the one feeling kind of down

2070.159 --> 2073.2690000000002
[Music]

2080.399 --> 2089.839
all right see you later

2100.56 --> 2107.2799999999997
right so i think i got the attention of

2103.839 --> 2109.359
a couple of trolls these days

2107.28 --> 2111.92
because i'm still getting like troll

2109.359 --> 2111.92
comments

2112.48 --> 2118.96
like i wonder even like why they even

2115.52 --> 2119.599
come to my show anymore because it's not

2118.96 --> 2122.88
like i

2119.599 --> 2125.119
com yeah i talk a significant portion

2122.88 --> 2128.1600000000003
about flat earth anymore

2125.119 --> 2130.8
it's just regular shows where i didn't

2128.16 --> 2134.0789999999997
even bring it up

2130.8 --> 2136.6400000000003
but they still keep on just

2134.079 --> 2139.28
getting in my comment section and

2136.64 --> 2145.839
telling me how terrible it is and

2139.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
and all that

2146.72 --> 2151.5989999999997
but i yeah i the thing is i don't really

2149.599 --> 2154.48
ask other flat earthers about it

2151.599 --> 2156.7200000000003
i know that nathan just gets swamped by

2154.48 --> 2160.64
those types of comments so he

2156.72 --> 2160.64
he doesn't even pay attention anymore

2162.079 --> 2165.76
and i wonder with others how bad it is

2164.16 --> 2168.3199999999997
i've noticed that a lot of people

2165.76 --> 2173.8390000000004
have just closed down things like they

2168.32 --> 2173.839
just don't want to watch anymore

2181.52 --> 2185.599
and with that i mean the channel owners

2184.079 --> 2187.119
watched the comments

2185.599 --> 2189.76
it's a lot of people that have just

2187.119 --> 2189.76
turned it off

2197.119 --> 2200.4
yeah nathan loves trolls but it's also

2199.28 --> 2202.1600000000003
kind of like

2200.4 --> 2205.28
it's not even that he loves it it's just

2202.16 --> 2205.2799999999997
that it's his thing

2208.48 --> 2213.68
it's his spot he is there to

2213.76 --> 2217.44
for the trolls to share their pain and

2216.4 --> 2229.839
he

2217.44 --> 2229.839
he really looks at it like that

2231.839 --> 2236.0789999999997
and it really helps to look at it like

2233.76 --> 2239.8390000000004
that too like especially if you get

2236.079 --> 2242.2400000000002
if you just get agitated by what they do

2239.839 --> 2243.92
then it's helpful to take a little step

2242.24 --> 2244.7999999999997
back and just look at it and then

2243.92 --> 2247.839
realize

2244.8 --> 2250.88
why they're doing it zone in on the

2247.839 --> 2253.2799999999997
feeling that they have that drives them

2250.88 --> 2254.2400000000002
instead of the feeling that they try to

2253.28 --> 2257.8390000000004
conjure

2254.24 --> 2257.839
with you

2258.079 --> 2263.76
and then you realize they are really

2260.4 --> 2263.76
just sharing their pain

2265.92 --> 2269.119
but they're yeah they're not gonna

2267.44 --> 2272.0
accomplish anything like

2269.119 --> 2274.4
whether you respond to it to temporarily

2272.0 --> 2277.2
distract them from their pain

2274.4 --> 2279.04
or whether you ignore it their pain is

2277.2 --> 2282.0789999999997
not going to go away

2279.04 --> 2285.359
until they confront themselves with

2282.079 --> 2287.119
the reason why it is there and they're

2285.359 --> 2290.96
not that's why they're

2287.119 --> 2290.96
yeah ballers in chat

2291.2 --> 2294.24
that's why they do that

2297.68 --> 2300.96
because they're not getting rid of it

2299.76 --> 2313.8390000000004
[Music]

2300.96 --> 2313.839
they keep doubling down

2317.359 --> 2321.5989999999997
all right some people have a drive to

2319.28 --> 2326.0
ruin people's day

2321.599 --> 2329.119
well zack sterling again it's

2326.0 --> 2331.599
that drive it's only a drive of

2329.119 --> 2333.76
apparent competence like oh i'm so

2331.599 --> 2336.2400000000002
efficient at this

2333.76 --> 2338.5600000000004
thing that is purely there to make

2336.24 --> 2341.839
believe like i'm more in control than

2338.56 --> 2343.68
the people i am communicating with

2341.839 --> 2345.44
so it's just a little spell for

2343.68 --> 2347.04
themselves

2345.44 --> 2350.2400000000002
make believe that they're in control

2347.04 --> 2355.839
again you see

2350.24 --> 2355.839
that's the mechanism behind a lot of it

2362.5 --> 2369.839
[Music]

2366.839 --> 2369.839
right

2376.24 --> 2380.839
all right yeah by the way i've been

2377.92 --> 2383.599
thinking again about that whole balloon

2380.839 --> 2386.24
situation video that stonemonkey3d

2383.599 --> 2388.4
shared with me with huli balloons or

2386.24 --> 2392.3999999999996
something of the like

2388.4 --> 2395.119
being displayed in the vomit comment it

2392.4 --> 2397.599
was exactly what i was looking for

2395.119 --> 2399.28
so he found it i think yeah i want to

2397.599 --> 2401.599
thank him for that

2399.28 --> 2403.119
but i now i am kind of puzzled as to

2401.599 --> 2411.839
what is really

2403.119 --> 2411.839
how is this work

2428.0 --> 2435.28
and i think also i realized that maybe

2431.599 --> 2438.6400000000003
brian's support theory actually might be

2435.28 --> 2442.3190000000004
able to explain it better

2438.64 --> 2445.44
that there's just

2442.319 --> 2447.52
like a centripetal

2445.44 --> 2448.8
like effect like the plane diving

2447.52 --> 2451.68
basically causes a

2448.8 --> 2452.319
push a virtual push in relation to the

2451.68 --> 2456.24
meat yeah

2452.319 --> 2459.2799999999997
to the entire plane upward

2456.24 --> 2460.56
that kind of neutralizes relative

2459.28 --> 2464.8
density

2460.56 --> 2464.7999999999997
i guess it neutralizes yeah

2464.96 --> 2471.44
the seeming force but

2468.24 --> 2474.3999999999996
it's just that it gets a little

2471.44 --> 2478.079
complicated because

2474.4 --> 2478.079
relative density how it works

2478.16 --> 2483.52
but on the other hand look by the

2481.28 --> 2484.7200000000003
relative density theory to explain what

2483.52 --> 2488.16
was happening there

2484.72 --> 2491.2799999999997
i'd have to say that the

2488.16 --> 2492.8799999999997
yeah the sort of centripetal force alike

2491.28 --> 2495.599
effect

2492.88 --> 2496.48
of the diving plane the accelerating

2495.599 --> 2499.52
yeah lockstep

2496.48 --> 2502.8
acceleration diving maybe

2499.52 --> 2503.7599999999998
pushing the inside of the plane the air

2502.8 --> 2507.3590000000004
of it

2503.76 --> 2510.079
to upward causing

2507.359 --> 2512.4
well maybe the yeah the balloon to not

2510.079 --> 2512.4
really

2512.8 --> 2517.119
like it alters the the gradient within

2515.92 --> 2520.56
the plane perhaps

2517.119 --> 2523.839
so that the balloon really does not know

2520.56 --> 2523.839
where to go

2524.16 --> 2528.319
it's very weird i can't just outright

2526.8 --> 2531.599
explain it

2528.319 --> 2534.4
so i i want to definitely bring this up

2531.599 --> 2537.839
at the flat earth debate

2534.4 --> 2537.839
it is really odd to me

2539.68 --> 2546.64
no it did not shoot to the back it

2542.48 --> 2546.64
literally started hovering in neutral

2548.24 --> 2551.839
just like everything else

2562.88 --> 2569.04
it just the thing is is that for

2566.72 --> 2570.56
objects denser than the medium that

2569.04 --> 2573.68
makes sense

2570.56 --> 2575.52
but objects less dense i don't really

2573.68 --> 2577.9199999999996
understand how that's possible

2575.52 --> 2580.88
unless there is some kind of like

2577.92 --> 2584.8
gaseous pressure redistribution which

2580.88 --> 2587.2000000000003
kind of like supports the balloon

2584.8 --> 2588.96
equally from the top as it does from the

2587.2 --> 2590.0
bottom as brian would explain it and

2588.96 --> 2593.599
that's why they

2590.0 --> 2596.88
hover neutral instead of

2593.599 --> 2596.88
yeah shooting to the back

2600.48 --> 2607.92
a relative density feel well

2604.4 --> 2609.599
i don't really think so because it's not

2607.92 --> 2613.6800000000003
a normal situation

2609.599 --> 2616.079
like relative density is really

2613.68 --> 2618.8799999999997
yeah from a euclidean standpoint if

2616.079 --> 2622.0
there is an entire object

2618.88 --> 2624.48
the internal workings like if there is a

2622.0 --> 2626.96
medium within the object

2624.48 --> 2628.4
that is not what relative density is

2626.96 --> 2631.52
about it's always about

2628.4 --> 2634.2400000000002
the euclidean situation within the realm

2631.52 --> 2636.0
that's the anchor point of relative

2634.24 --> 2641.4399999999996
density

2636.0 --> 2641.44
but it is odd it is not what i expected

2642.72 --> 2646.839
relative density theory still stands

2645.04 --> 2648.16
it's still very much scientifically

2646.839 --> 2651.599
provable

2648.16 --> 2656.72
but yeah there is something weird

2651.599 --> 2656.7200000000003
about it within yeah accelerating

2660.839 --> 2663.839
mediums

2672.96 --> 2677.839
what sex sterling

2680.64 --> 2684.319
i know the guy that created

2686.4 --> 2694.48
what are you talking about

2691.44 --> 2695.68
what would a balloon do on a normal

2694.48 --> 2698.48
airplane flight

2695.68 --> 2699.2
well a normal airplane flight is not

2698.48 --> 2704.56
diving

2699.2 --> 2707.2
it's just moving horizontally on average

2704.56 --> 2710.24
so yeah the balloon would just

2707.2 --> 2710.24
just go upwards

2711.2 --> 2716.319
maybe well if the plane was accelerating

2714.64 --> 2718.64
which usually doesn't it

2716.319 --> 2720.319
just flies steady at a steady speed if

2718.64 --> 2722.72
it was accelerating then the balloon

2720.319 --> 2724.96
would go slightly forward

2722.72 --> 2727.9199999999996
just like it would in in an accelerating

2724.96 --> 2731.359
car i've seen that demonstrated

2727.92 --> 2736.0
but as long as the speed is constant

2731.359 --> 2736.0
then the balloon will just hang straight

2744.839 --> 2747.839
up

2749.68 --> 2754.7999999999997
and why does that happen well also

2752.079 --> 2754.8
because of

2755.28 --> 2759.28
well kind of the support theory the gas

2758.4 --> 2763.04
within the

2759.28 --> 2767.2000000000003
accelerating medium moves

2763.04 --> 2767.2
a little is pushed to the back

2768.16 --> 2773.04
and that's why the balloon then goes

2769.92 --> 2777.44
forward in that case

2773.04 --> 2779.359
so by that i think by that effect

2777.44 --> 2781.76
it is the same effect that i think

2779.359 --> 2784.319
causes the

2781.76 --> 2785.92
helium balloons within the vomit comet

2784.319 --> 2789.52
diving plane to

2785.92 --> 2792.079
i guess stay neutral because it is

2789.52 --> 2793.52
going downward at an accelerating rate

2792.079 --> 2797.92
specifically

2793.52 --> 2801.2
downward to that angle and all that

2797.92 --> 2803.04
so that there is an yeah

2801.2 --> 2804.96
an upward force because of the

2803.04 --> 2808.24
acceleration that causes

2804.96 --> 2811.76
things that the gas to push

2808.24 --> 2817.839
more upward causing the balloons to

2811.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
hover neutrally that is my explanation

2832.88 --> 2836.56
and then yeah it's obvious also by the

2834.96 --> 2839.0
way that that explanation

2836.56 --> 2841.52
that lit that it's about pressure

2839.0 --> 2842.48
redistribution due to applied forces

2841.52 --> 2845.7599999999998
right

2842.48 --> 2847.68
that is not a normal relative density

2845.76 --> 2851.3590000000004
setting relative density again

2847.68 --> 2854.24
is anchored within euclidean space

2851.359 --> 2856.88
so an accelerating object technically

2854.24 --> 2858.72
doesn't fall

2856.88 --> 2860.319
under the relative then things that

2858.72 --> 2863.1189999999997
happen within it don't fall under

2860.319 --> 2864.72
relative density theory normally

2863.119 --> 2866.1600000000003
because there's an accelera there's

2864.72 --> 2869.9199999999996
forces applied

2866.16 --> 2887.839
so then it works differently

2869.92 --> 2887.839
it's yeah that's been obvious so far

2891.2 --> 2896.5589999999997
does the gas in the balloon

2894.559 --> 2898.2400000000002
behave differently than the gas in the

2896.559 --> 2903.0400000000004
kevin how so

2898.24 --> 2907.52
what do you mean it's gas

2903.04 --> 2907.52
what type of behavior are you inquiring

2912.839 --> 2915.839
about

2947.76 --> 2952.0
right anyway for those that have don't

2950.16 --> 2954.72
know exactly

2952.0 --> 2955.599
what video i am referring to i'll post

2954.72 --> 2959.359
it

2955.599 --> 2970.88
again in the chat this is worthwhile

2959.359 --> 2972.88
taking a look at it

2970.88 --> 2974.6400000000003
the plane accelerates the air in the

2972.88 --> 2976.4
cabin would go backward but the balloon

2974.64 --> 2979.359
goes forward

2976.4 --> 2981.6800000000003
right because yeah i've had an

2979.359 --> 2983.5989999999997
explanation for that before in another

2981.68 --> 2986.48
sort of terminology and that is that the

2983.599 --> 2988.559
apparent axis for relative density which

2986.48 --> 2992.72
only an apparent axis

2988.559 --> 2994.8
alters when a force is applied

2992.72 --> 2996.64
because in a normal euclidean setting

2994.8 --> 2999.599
that axis is always

2996.64 --> 3001.1189999999997
the z-axis perfectly but when an

2999.599 --> 3003.6800000000003
acceleration happens

3001.119 --> 3005.92
then the things within that accelerating

3003.68 --> 3008.3999999999996
object

3005.92 --> 3009.599
it might have its own medium yeah the

3008.4 --> 3013.839
axis

3009.599 --> 3013.839
for relative density is altered

3014.16 --> 3021.1189999999997
or in the case of diving down it even

3016.8 --> 3021.119
seems to be neutralized entirely

3021.2 --> 3024.96
it's only an apparent axis though

3024.079 --> 3027.44
because

3024.96 --> 3029.359
yeah in the euclidean setting the whole

3027.44 --> 3030.7200000000003
thing is moving so it doesn't really

3029.359 --> 3034.16
work that way it

3030.72 --> 3034.16
gets complicated like that

3037.28 --> 3040.4
but from within the medium or from

3039.92 --> 3042.7200000000003
within

3040.4 --> 3044.7200000000003
the object with its own medium

3042.72 --> 3045.7599999999998
accelerating a force applied to the

3044.72 --> 3049.839
entire thing

3045.76 --> 3049.8390000000004
yeah the apparent axis

3050.24 --> 3054.0
for the relative or yeah in this case an

3053.52 --> 3056.96
apparent

3054.0 --> 3058.72
axis because the axis in the euclidean

3056.96 --> 3062.48
setting will not be altered but

3058.72 --> 3066.0
yeah in a moving object the apparent

3062.48 --> 3070.72
axis for relative density it

3066.0 --> 3073.28
seems to change as a force applies

3070.72 --> 3074.64
it only works in if the move if the

3073.28 --> 3083.8390000000004
object is moving

3074.64 --> 3083.839
within space though

3088.079 --> 3093.2000000000003
so yeah any relative density axis

3091.28 --> 3095.52
alteration or apparent axis

3093.2 --> 3096.48
alteration will always the cause for it

3095.52 --> 3102.16
will always be

3096.48 --> 3104.96
accelerated motion or centripetal force

3102.16 --> 3111.839
which is also a form of motion can be

3104.96 --> 3111.839
steady motion that way though

3122.72 --> 3126.0
yeah ryan eartherton look that ron

3125.28 --> 3128.2400000000002
mitter guy

3126.0 --> 3129.28
you're all cracking you were being so

3128.24 --> 3132.64
laughy about

3129.28 --> 3134.7200000000003
what makes you think that he isn't uh

3132.64 --> 3136.16
really like that did you talk to him

3134.72 --> 3138.5589999999997
before that

3136.16 --> 3140.8799999999997
when he wasn't talking like that because

3138.559 --> 3143.0400000000004
i had not seen any clue that he was

3140.88 --> 3146.4
anything other than

3143.04 --> 3146.4
the way he was acting so

3147.04 --> 3153.839
you were getting a little on my nerves

3148.559 --> 3153.8390000000004
there about that reinertherton

3169.28 --> 3174.48
all right yeah and samson about the

3171.839 --> 3178.4
whole relative density situation and

3174.48 --> 3181.359
this airplane look relative density

3178.4 --> 3184.88
it works the premise works it's

3181.359 --> 3187.52
scientifically experimental

3184.88 --> 3188.4
it's a scientific experiment valid

3187.52 --> 3191.52
scient

3188.4 --> 3194.2400000000002
valid science it's just that

3191.52 --> 3196.559
how it works and the results i've been

3194.24 --> 3199.2799999999997
developing that

3196.559 --> 3200.8
mostly verbal for a long time basically

3199.28 --> 3203.8390000000004
since i switched

3200.8 --> 3206.88
away from the assumption of gravity

3203.839 --> 3208.4
in some way trying to defend that trying

3206.88 --> 3210.0
to explain that and i've just been

3208.4 --> 3211.6800000000003
working on relative density how it

3210.0 --> 3212.64
actually works i've been the one that

3211.68 --> 3215.2799999999997
basically said

3212.64 --> 3217.68
also very proud of that that yeah it's

3215.28 --> 3221.44
very cute if an object

3217.68 --> 3223.2
is resting on another object

3221.44 --> 3224.96
it's not falling oh then there's no

3223.2 --> 3226.96
acceleration yeah there is

3224.96 --> 3229.04
well not literally there's just pressure

3226.96 --> 3231.2
it's the pressure is there because it's

3229.04 --> 3234.0
still surrounded by a medium

3231.2 --> 3235.52
with which it is not in equilibrium

3234.0 --> 3237.839
density wise

3235.52 --> 3238.96
but it can't maneuver further so then it

3237.839 --> 3241.92
translates that

3238.96 --> 3243.119
into pressure and that's i expanded

3241.92 --> 3250.48
relative density

3243.119 --> 3254.4
with that because it is always the case

3250.48 --> 3257.76
so yeah relative density as a theory it

3254.4 --> 3261.04
there's just more to expand

3257.76 --> 3262.7200000000003
about it like how it works the core

3261.04 --> 3264.64
function

3262.72 --> 3266.7999999999997
the scientific proof it's there it's

3264.64 --> 3268.7999999999997
just that it can be

3266.8 --> 3270.48
further developed and i've spent a lot

3268.8 --> 3274.559
of time

3270.48 --> 3277.28
years now on yeah trying to perfect it

3274.559 --> 3278.1600000000003
as a concept scientifically proven

3277.28 --> 3280.1600000000003
concept

3278.16 --> 3282.24
and then just figuring it out how it

3280.16 --> 3285.359
completely works so even

3282.24 --> 3286.4799999999996
me i might be considered some kind of

3285.359 --> 3292.799
expert on it

3286.48 --> 3295.68
but it is still in development

3292.799 --> 3297.839
still trying to figure out how how do

3295.68 --> 3300.0789999999997
you describe what is going on in a way

3297.839 --> 3300.0789999999997
that

3302.16 --> 3310.0
is just not incorrect

3307.2 --> 3311.2
in any way have you written a scientific

3310.0 --> 3314.24
no i have not

3311.2 --> 3316.5589999999997
for peer review of piss off

3314.24 --> 3318.16
i'm not gonna write any scientific paper

3316.559 --> 3320.48
and i don't give a [ __ ] about the

3318.16 --> 3322.8799999999997
supposed science community like that

3320.48 --> 3325.04
they don't give a [ __ ] about me because

3322.88 --> 3326.4
flat earthers

3325.04 --> 3328.4
they're not going to do anything with

3326.4 --> 3330.799
that and besides

3328.4 --> 3333.28
i'm not going to be very good at writing

3330.799 --> 3335.68
a scientific paper

3333.28 --> 3337.599
i'm not about scientific literature at

3335.68 --> 3339.839
all

3337.599 --> 3340.6400000000003
my focus has always been just trying to

3339.839 --> 3344.4
explain

3340.64 --> 3344.4
things so people get it

3346.0 --> 3352.559
that's it and i've tried to

3349.119 --> 3355.92
learn more academics

3352.559 --> 3357.8390000000004
in that process assimilating that to get

3355.92 --> 3358.88
more specific to get technically more

3357.839 --> 3360.839
correct

3358.88 --> 3363.2000000000003
doesn't mean that i'm going to be

3360.839 --> 3365.2
proficient in writing some kind of

3363.2 --> 3371.1189999999997
official scientific paper at

3365.2 --> 3371.1189999999997
all i don't even know where to start

3374.559 --> 3378.1600000000003
although look if somebody is going to do

3377.04 --> 3382.4
that

3378.16 --> 3386.96
i'd love to be a part of it and insert

3382.4 --> 3389.359
the details mechanical wise that i have

3386.96 --> 3390.0
discovered about it i would definitely

3389.359 --> 3392.799
want to be

3390.0 --> 3394.96
part of a team that would be working on

3392.799 --> 3397.44
a scientific paper but i

3394.96 --> 3398.88
me arwin as an individual i'm not gonna

3397.44 --> 3404.319
write a scientific paper

3398.88 --> 3406.2400000000002
it's ridiculous

3404.319 --> 3408.24
peer review of it who gives a [ __ ] about

3406.24 --> 3410.799
peer review peer review is completely

3408.24 --> 3410.799
useless

3411.52 --> 3414.72
it doesn't matter it look

3415.28 --> 3421.0400000000004
peer reviewed like people could

3418.4 --> 3423.119
write a peer review about electrostatics

3421.04 --> 3425.359
being the cause of gravity and then

3423.119 --> 3426.48
potentially thousands of people would

3425.359 --> 3429.5989999999997
sign on to that

3426.48 --> 3433.839
does that make it real no it doesn't

3429.599 --> 3433.839
doesn't help at all

3450.0 --> 3461.839
what right arson

3453.119 --> 3461.839
oh right yeah

3466.24 --> 3470.319
we all thought he was right

3470.559 --> 3476.7200000000003
so you didn't know i thought you

3473.599 --> 3477.04
knew i thought you knew him and you knew

3476.72 --> 3480.16
that

3477.04 --> 3480.64
he was pulling an act so seriously you

3480.16 --> 3483.44
just

3480.64 --> 3485.52
assumed he was acting use you don't

3483.44 --> 3486.96
think a guy from indonesia that can

3485.52 --> 3489.28
barely speak english

3486.96 --> 3490.96
might actually just decide to get in

3489.28 --> 3492.96
chat

3490.96 --> 3494.2400000000002
and try to communicate you can't even

3492.96 --> 3498.96
imagine that

3494.24 --> 3502.0789999999997
really i'm shocked

3498.96 --> 3504.799
because yeah for my empathic senses

3502.079 --> 3506.2400000000002
did not give me that impression at all

3504.799 --> 3508.88
like

3506.24 --> 3510.9599999999996
i even like called him uh a bot and all

3508.88 --> 3513.04
that like that this can't be real

3510.96 --> 3516.079
but then the way he responded he

3513.04 --> 3518.799
immediately disproved that

3516.079 --> 3518.799
immediately

3520.88 --> 3524.319
so at first i thought like this is too

3522.88 --> 3526.799
ridiculous like

3524.319 --> 3529.04
this is a baller trying to be cookie

3526.799 --> 3531.7599999999998
trying to be a cookie flat earther

3529.04 --> 3533.7599999999998
but then just the way he spoke and the

3531.76 --> 3534.1600000000003
way he answered my questions which he

3533.76 --> 3536.6400000000003
did

3534.16 --> 3537.52
every time that's already a sign this is

3536.64 --> 3540.0
not a baller

3537.52 --> 3540.88
ballers don't answer questions quickly

3540.0 --> 3544.48
they don't

3540.88 --> 3546.96
they never do you get it

3544.48 --> 3548.0
and so i figured out no this is not a

3546.96 --> 3552.16
troll

3548.0 --> 3552.16
this guy is actually a real guy

3556.319 --> 3560.72
and yeah the idea actually kind of

3558.079 --> 3562.96
appealed to me it's like oh wow

3560.72 --> 3564.72
so flat earth is not just english

3562.96 --> 3567.04
exclusive

3564.72 --> 3567.9199999999996
and also this guy just didn't seem like

3567.04 --> 3571.04
he was very

3567.92 --> 3572.64
polluted by terrible baller behavior and

3571.04 --> 3575.2
all that

3572.64 --> 3586.48
he's not been soaked into the all that

3575.2 --> 3588.48
nonsense yet

3586.48 --> 3590.4
in your opinion he was right but you

3588.48 --> 3591.599
didn't have any proof because you gave

3590.4 --> 3595.52
me the impression

3591.599 --> 3599.119
that you actually knew him before

3595.52 --> 3600.48
he engaged in acting like he was a flat

3599.119 --> 3602.48
earther that could barely speak

3600.48 --> 3605.599
english you gave me the impression you

3602.48 --> 3608.48
literally knew that

3605.599 --> 3609.119
i asked and you said that pretty much

3608.48 --> 3615.839
probably

3609.119 --> 3615.839
slight miscommunication

3617.28 --> 3620.7200000000003
well i thought that you did

3621.92 --> 3627.599
because you even did that after i said

3624.799 --> 3630.72
no i think this guy is real

3627.599 --> 3632.25
so you acted like you had a

3630.72 --> 3633.7599999999998
knowledge of it

3632.25 --> 3636.4
[Music]

3633.76 --> 3637.599
but apparently yeah like by your own

3636.4 --> 3639.76
saying now you didn't

3637.599 --> 3639.76
so

3641.599 --> 3645.2000000000003
you accidentally gaslighted me right

3644.48 --> 3647.2
eartherton

3645.2 --> 3649.52
you didn't mean to but you accidentally

3647.2 --> 3652.96
did and i didn't fall for it

3649.52 --> 3652.96
i trusted my intuition

3655.04 --> 3657.839
it happens

3679.119 --> 3682.559
audience in the dark of just talking

3680.88 --> 3683.599
about something that happened in chat

3682.559 --> 3685.8390000000004
there was a guy

3683.599 --> 3685.839
there

3688.079 --> 3692.7200000000003
who was a flat earther but he could

3690.16 --> 3695.839
barely speak english

3692.72 --> 3697.68
and everybody thought he was a baller

3695.839 --> 3699.119
acting like a dumb flat earther as a

3697.68 --> 3702.48
troll

3699.119 --> 3704.88
but i was not so sure of that

3702.48 --> 3705.76
and then eventually i thought no this is

3704.88 --> 3707.599
a real guy

3705.76 --> 3713.0400000000004
but everybody just kept acting like he

3707.599 --> 3716.319
was a troll

3713.04 --> 3716.319
that's who we're talking about

3721.119 --> 3727.839
it's opinion

3735.16 --> 3738.3399999999997
[Music]

3738.839 --> 3741.839
uh

3742.559 --> 3745.599
yeah and i wasn't uh in a flat earth

3744.799 --> 3755.839
debate chat

3745.599 --> 3755.839
by the way

3761.839 --> 3765.92
right but anyway back to i like that

3764.16 --> 3768.0
idea of the scientific paper

3765.92 --> 3769.92
i think that probably at some point it

3768.0 --> 3772.96
would be good to have to attempt a

3769.92 --> 3778.319
scientific paper

3772.96 --> 3778.319
get really nitty gritty academic

3779.68 --> 3784.3999999999996
like really getting real with it and

3782.0 --> 3787.44
then see

3784.4 --> 3790.48
what would happen but

3787.44 --> 3792.0
there also might be already a paper like

3790.48 --> 3795.039
that out there

3792.0 --> 3797.68
that would be older like

3795.039 --> 3798.4
probably like at least 50 years old or

3797.68 --> 3802.16
more

3798.4 --> 3802.1600000000003
so there might already be something out

3808.839 --> 3811.839
there

3814.0 --> 3820.64
i just trusted ryan moore so took

3817.2 --> 3823.1189999999997
word for it now zach sterling it's

3820.64 --> 3824.24
it's a little bit more complicated i

3823.119 --> 3828.319
ryan gave me

3824.24 --> 3828.319
an impression he did not say it

3828.64 --> 3834.24
literally like he knew

3832.079 --> 3836.6400000000003
like he had actual confirmed

3834.24 --> 3839.9199999999996
foreknowledge that the guy

3836.64 --> 3842.64
was engaging currently in an act like

3839.92 --> 3844.4
that the same account would be talking

3842.64 --> 3848.0
very differently before that

3844.4 --> 3851.6800000000003
he gave me the impression

3848.0 --> 3855.68
and then basically did not confirm to me

3851.68 --> 3858.48
that it's only a suspicion he had

3855.68 --> 3859.9199999999996
he really pushed it like no it's a troll

3858.48 --> 3862.72
it's a troll

3859.92 --> 3863.76
just didn't believe it but i was trying

3862.72 --> 3867.52
to technically

3863.76 --> 3870.7990000000004
figure out whether he was a troll or not

3867.52 --> 3872.4
yes i called him a larp because at first

3870.799 --> 3875.44
the first impression was like

3872.4 --> 3875.44
this is ridiculous

3875.68 --> 3879.0389999999998
like how bad a speller he was was kind

3878.16 --> 3880.5589999999997
of ridiculous

3879.039 --> 3882.48
and i thought immediately like this is

3880.559 --> 3884.96
alarm but then

3882.48 --> 3886.799
quickly after i tested some more and

3884.96 --> 3888.799
figured out wait no he's not alarmed

3886.799 --> 3889.839
because he's actually responding to my

3888.799 --> 3893.599
questions when i

3889.839 --> 3896.799
directly address him and

3893.599 --> 3899.039
gave pretty the data that

3896.799 --> 3901.119
kind of makes sense basically asked him

3899.039 --> 3902.96
like are you good at english do you

3901.119 --> 3906.4
understand everything we say

3902.96 --> 3909.44
how how good is your english

3906.4 --> 3912.079
and he said that's not good at all

3909.44 --> 3915.28
and i asked like so how much do you

3912.079 --> 3917.039
understand of english like do you know

3915.28 --> 3918.4
like the show what they're talking about

3917.039 --> 3920.2400000000002
can you follow what they're talking

3918.4 --> 3923.52
about and you had to admit like well

3920.24 --> 3927.5989999999997
barely well that's already

3923.52 --> 3930.799
just like it's not a troll

3927.599 --> 3934.2400000000002
like that doesn't make any sense it

3930.799 --> 3936.799
was literally just a non-english person

3934.24 --> 3940.3999999999996
curious as to what is this flat earth

3936.799 --> 3942.48
going on over here because he

3940.4 --> 3944.4
tried to explain that he and his friends

3942.48 --> 3947.2
he had some hindu friends

3944.4 --> 3948.799
that they also were discussing about

3947.2 --> 3952.3999999999996
flat earth

3948.799 --> 3954.96
so yeah there you go it's just

3952.4 --> 3957.039
something outside of the usual circles

3954.96 --> 3959.92
and at first i thought it was a

3957.039 --> 3961.119
larp but then after some further

3959.92 --> 3962.96
inquiring it

3961.119 --> 3964.4
i figured out now this this is not a

3962.96 --> 3967.839
larp this makes

3964.4 --> 3967.839
there's consistency to this

3971.44 --> 3976.88
my instincts were right it's it's fine

3973.68 --> 3976.8799999999997
rainer i'm not trying to

3977.52 --> 3981.119
i'm not trying to shame you it's all

3979.359 --> 3984.319
fine it's logical dude

3981.119 --> 3987.359
look in the chats with all these trolls

3984.319 --> 3988.799
yeah it's very logical you know it's

3987.359 --> 3990.72
like

3988.799 --> 3992.0
see it like this there's like a trench

3990.72 --> 3995.359
like war

3992.0 --> 3997.28
zone going on so everybody that's gonna

3995.359 --> 3999.5989999999997
pop up and it's not gonna be like

3997.28 --> 4001.3590000000004
oh here's the flag flat earth info where

3999.599 --> 4004.079
on your side

4001.359 --> 4004.88
you're automatically gonna assume it's a

4004.079 --> 4007.6800000000003
baller

4004.88 --> 4008.1600000000003
with tricks because it's a war zone and

4007.68 --> 4011.359
if an

4008.16 --> 4013.7599999999998
actual complete outsider just wanders in

4011.359 --> 4014.799
yeah it's very easy to think that they

4013.76 --> 4017.8390000000004
are an act

4014.799 --> 4021.839
to try and fool around you see don't

4017.839 --> 4021.839
worry about it

4025.039 --> 4028.7200000000003
it's just sometimes it isn't

4030.88 --> 4035.2000000000003
also a lot of these trolls that do act

4033.68 --> 4038.799
they have a lot of trouble

4035.2 --> 4042.0
hiding it you know

4038.799 --> 4043.119
foreign knowledge is kind of difficult

4042.0 --> 4046.0
to hide

4043.119 --> 4048.079
that would require a deep act and most

4046.0 --> 4051.68
of these ballers they can't even do they

4048.079 --> 4053.039
can't do that because deep acting

4051.68 --> 4056.319
requires a certain

4053.039 --> 4058.0
insight and peace

4056.319 --> 4060.079
you have to have a certain level of

4058.0 --> 4060.559
peace well it's very obvious the ballers

4060.079 --> 4062.2400000000002
don't

4060.559 --> 4063.92
that's why they're there in the chat

4062.24 --> 4065.1189999999997
doing their thing because they don't

4063.92 --> 4067.2000000000003
have peace

4065.119 --> 4068.4
when you don't have peace you can't do a

4067.2 --> 4071.68
deep act

4068.4 --> 4077.839
not without revealing it

4071.68 --> 4077.839
that's something i've learned

4088.839 --> 4091.839
right

4092.72 --> 4097.119
yes samson i agree and it's also about

4098.4 --> 4104.48
trolls that do nothing else but just

4101.52 --> 4106.0
trying to trick their opponents the flat

4104.48 --> 4109.3589999999995
earthers in this case

4106.0 --> 4113.52
to make them feel foolish or have some

4109.359 --> 4116.719
virtual triumph because their sole focus

4113.52 --> 4118.96
or a big part of it is just doing that

4116.719 --> 4120.4
they're always going to have some of it

4118.96 --> 4121.92
they're always going to find some

4120.4 --> 4123.44
victories because they've spent

4121.92 --> 4125.839
everything on that

4123.44 --> 4128.08
they will always have their moments you

4125.839 --> 4129.839
shouldn't be worried about oh my god i

4128.08 --> 4133.6
can't let the ballers

4129.839 --> 4136.3189999999995
have a single virtual victory

4133.6 --> 4137.120000000001
that's that's kind of wasting your own

4136.319 --> 4139.4400000000005
energy on it

4137.12 --> 4140.3189999999995
they are wasting their energy on what

4139.44 --> 4143.919999999999
they do

4140.319 --> 4145.839000000001
you shouldn't follow suit just give

4143.92 --> 4147.759
him some of it because it doesn't matter

4145.839 --> 4150.5599999999995
it's just a virtual victory for

4147.759 --> 4153.759
themselves to

4150.56 --> 4155.4400000000005
yeah to prevent a few more moments from

4153.759 --> 4156.239
being confronted with their pain that

4155.44 --> 4159.12
they're

4156.239 --> 4160.0
yeah that their belief is just wrong

4159.12 --> 4164.3189999999995
that's why they do

4160.0 --> 4165.92
it so they shall shall always find some

4164.319 --> 4168.0
victories

4165.92 --> 4170.2390000000005
don't worry about it you don't have to

4168.0 --> 4172.08
feel guilty for letting them have it

4170.239 --> 4175.839
sometimes

4172.08 --> 4178.719
and yeah if you just don't bite into

4175.839 --> 4181.12
everything just to not give them the

4178.719 --> 4183.12
virtual victory then you might also

4181.12 --> 4185.199
yeah by accident attack innocent

4183.12 --> 4188.64
bystanders as it were

4185.199 --> 4191.678999999999
that weren't ballers but did not

4188.64 --> 4192.56
fall in line specifically with the yeah

4191.679 --> 4195.1990000000005
the correct

4192.56 --> 4196.320000000001
i guess signaling the flatter signaling

4195.199 --> 4198.32
proving that they

4196.32 --> 4201.04
are on the right side in the argument

4198.32 --> 4202.639999999999
right they will get victimized too if

4201.04 --> 4205.12
you

4202.64 --> 4207.76
are fixated on never letting the ballers

4205.12 --> 4211.12
have any virtual victories

4207.76 --> 4213.76
that's why i tried to prevent that

4211.12 --> 4217.28
when the baller gets on my nerves i will

4213.76 --> 4220.4800000000005
bite down on them

4217.28 --> 4223.44
but i don't do that per default

4220.48 --> 4223.44
because of that reason

4226.239 --> 4231.839999999999
so are people saying all ballers are

4229.04 --> 4231.84
trolls

4234.239 --> 4237.36
well not all the time

4239.04 --> 4246.32
they don't spend all their time trolling

4242.159 --> 4250.32
but yeah a lot of ballers in the chat

4246.32 --> 4253.36
and on youtube these specific ballers

4250.32 --> 4259.84
yeah yeah they kind of are

4253.36 --> 4259.839999999999
trolls almost all of them

4261.12 --> 4267.36
you tiny bumble have like

4265.199 --> 4269.919999999999
some minor troll fragments you have it

4267.36 --> 4273.04
in you you just

4269.92 --> 4273.36
don't feed it a lot and i appreciate

4273.04 --> 4275.76
that

4273.36 --> 4277.92
but it's still in there i know it is

4275.76 --> 4281.1990000000005
i've seen you

4277.92 --> 4281.1990000000005
do some trolling

4281.52 --> 4287.84
but yeah you got it under control

4293.76 --> 4297.1990000000005
steamy traveler i don't know

4297.679 --> 4306.159
my dad is on flatter side

4302.159 --> 4308.719
definitely i'm pretty sure about that

4306.159 --> 4310.879999999999
as for the rest of my family i think

4308.719 --> 4311.76
they're all just blissfully ignorant and

4310.88 --> 4314.88
they don't really

4311.76 --> 4318.719
want to know

4314.88 --> 4319.52
but they would never openly come out for

4318.719 --> 4322.08
flat earth

4319.52 --> 4324.0
even if they did kind of know it then

4322.08 --> 4326.239
they'd keep it a secret they

4324.0 --> 4328.719
they don't want to get involved that's

4326.239 --> 4330.32
what i know from it from the other side

4328.719 --> 4332.2390000000005
of the family

4330.32 --> 4335.28
and it's also probably a reason why i

4332.239 --> 4335.28
never hear from them

4335.52 --> 4338.56
because they're just trying to stay away

4337.36 --> 4341.44
from the open

4338.56 --> 4344.719
flat earther that does a daily show that

4341.44 --> 4344.719
includes flat earth

4347.92 --> 4352.64
i don't even know if they know about it

4350.159 --> 4356.96
or if they've forgotten

4352.64 --> 4358.56
if they figured it out at some point

4356.96 --> 4360.0
and in this case i'm talking about my

4358.56 --> 4364.320000000001
brother and just

4360.0 --> 4364.32
my aunts nephews and all that

4365.04 --> 4374.239
because i never hear from them like ever

4371.76 --> 4376.320000000001
might also have to do with that in my

4374.239 --> 4380.159
teens and everything in that period i

4376.32 --> 4383.759999999999
wasn't a very pleasant person

4380.159 --> 4385.759999999999
it was just very upfront rebellious

4383.76 --> 4387.6
about a lot of things

4385.76 --> 4389.92
i think that might have also kind of

4387.6 --> 4392.2390000000005
started the rift

4389.92 --> 4394.4
and me now turning a flat earther even

4392.239 --> 4397.44
though i am improving my behavior

4394.4 --> 4398.48
significantly in many ways i have grown

4397.44 --> 4401.678999999999
up

4398.48 --> 4401.678999999999
there's still that rift

4404.56 --> 4413.84
and kind of like we

4407.679 --> 4416.8
me myself not really knowing how to

4413.84 --> 4418.56
how to communicate them with them and

4416.8 --> 4427.84
about what

4418.56 --> 4427.84
was your accident fear no no she was not

4429.84 --> 4432.08
like

4433.6 --> 4441.84
she might no

4436.64 --> 4441.84
she doesn't want to know if she did

4449.52 --> 4452.8
she was probably in many ways just

4451.36 --> 4455.599999999999
terrified to kind of like

4452.8 --> 4458.400000000001
lose her job over that [ __ ] because she

4455.6 --> 4458.400000000001
was a dentist

4458.96 --> 4462.719
pretty ingrained in the system up to a

4461.6 --> 4464.64
certain degree

4462.719 --> 4466.32
and i think she was just afraid of it

4464.64 --> 4468.820000000001
she just doesn't didn't want to have

4466.32 --> 4471.978999999999
anything to do with that

4468.82 --> 4471.978999999999
[Music]

4476.4 --> 4483.04
because in ways she kind of let me

4479.44 --> 4484.879999999999
do it like dig into it a little

4483.04 --> 4486.8
she knew i was a conspiracy theorist and

4484.88 --> 4487.84
she even knew i was into alex jones and

4486.8 --> 4489.679
all that

4487.84 --> 4491.360000000001
i think she thought that was more

4489.679 --> 4494.88
annoying than even my

4491.36 --> 4497.5199999999995
yeah my fantasy hollow earth

4494.88 --> 4499.76
things and flatter things she was more

4497.52 --> 4503.120000000001
annoyed by me watching alex jones

4499.76 --> 4504.8
him being very loud and noisy and kind

4503.12 --> 4506.96
of like yeah negative atmosphere

4504.8 --> 4508.2390000000005
i get that in retrospect i totally get

4506.96 --> 4511.04
that now

4508.239 --> 4512.5599999999995
but i was just still very hooked on that

4511.04 --> 4515.12
whole thing

4512.56 --> 4516.96
the new world order still learning about

4515.12 --> 4520.32
it

4516.96 --> 4521.52
but i think i confronted her at one time

4520.32 --> 4524.5599999999995
like

4521.52 --> 4527.040000000001
come on let's do that let's be

4524.56 --> 4528.0
let's get into flat earth and she really

4527.04 --> 4530.56
like no

4528.0 --> 4530.56
no way

4533.92 --> 4540.88
so after that point i kind of didn't

4536.84 --> 4540.88
really bring it up again

4541.28 --> 4546.239
and forgot about it because i didn't

4543.84 --> 4547.92
want to lose her

4546.239 --> 4550.839999999999
and we're talking again yeah it's like

4547.92 --> 4552.08
the last time i woke up before the final

4550.84 --> 4553.84
time

4552.08 --> 4556.32
because again i've said many times i've

4553.84 --> 4559.52
been confronted with flat earth

4556.32 --> 4564.0
many times throughout my life

4559.52 --> 4567.76
learned about it some then got scared

4564.0 --> 4570.0
and forgot about it

4567.76 --> 4572.320000000001
usually scared in a peer pressure kind

4570.0 --> 4572.32
of way

4572.8 --> 4576.400000000001
that's just what happened that's how it

4578.84 --> 4584.0
happened

4581.6 --> 4584.96
and it was extra weird even for me

4584.0 --> 4589.36
because yeah

4584.96 --> 4592.32
in that last time when i was with my ex

4589.36 --> 4594.32
when i got into sort of flat earth i

4592.32 --> 4597.92
also had the vision experience

4594.32 --> 4601.599999999999
of seeing in freaking eric the bay video

4597.92 --> 4604.88
and that was in like 2012

4601.6 --> 4609.84
which there shouldn't have been any it's

4604.88 --> 4609.84
so weird

4610.08 --> 4623.84
so yeah that all that happened on top

4613.199 --> 4623.839999999999
of it it's just really weird

4628.0 --> 4631.679
at least i think it was eric it should

4629.92 --> 4634.56
have been or

4631.679 --> 4637.12
maybe one of the other guys because how

4634.56 --> 4639.6
long have there been like

4637.12 --> 4640.239
flat earth dedicated videos out there on

4639.6 --> 4643.679
the

4640.239 --> 4645.919999999999
on youtube for how long

4643.679 --> 4648.08
i know like the big opening really

4645.92 --> 4651.36
happened 2015 that's when like

4648.08 --> 4655.6
all kinds of people got into it but was

4651.36 --> 4658.639999999999
there any kind of videos out there

4655.6 --> 4662.719
dedicated to like flat earth like

4658.64 --> 4665.1990000000005
bigger summaries of all the things

4662.719 --> 4669.92
that prove the earth is flat was there

4665.199 --> 4669.919999999999
videos of that even in 2012 i don't

4676.84 --> 4683.1990000000005
know

4679.84 --> 4683.1990000000005
never looked yeah

4689.28 --> 4693.599999999999
well i guess that if i'd ever have an

4691.76 --> 4696.4800000000005
opportunity

4693.6 --> 4696.96
to like more directly speak with him on

4696.48 --> 4699.759999999999
a friend

4696.96 --> 4700.96
in a friendly way i'd like to ask eric

4699.76 --> 4703.04
today

4700.96 --> 4704.64
like when is the first video you

4703.04 --> 4706.8
uploaded ever

4704.64 --> 4707.84
because i have a very weird memory of a

4706.8 --> 4710.2390000000005
video

4707.84 --> 4713.52
that might not have been possible in

4710.239 --> 4713.5199999999995
that time for me to see

4713.84 --> 4721.84
because i'm still yeah i've seen that

4717.12 --> 4721.84
i wonder how that's possible

4742.48 --> 4749.5199999999995
haven't told anyone till now turret 306

4747.679 --> 4753.04
so you have told them have you told them

4749.52 --> 4753.040000000001
this christmas

4753.84 --> 4758.56
you can sort his youtube videos by date

4756.32 --> 4760.719
yes but

4758.56 --> 4762.64
is this his first like is he still

4760.719 --> 4764.0
running on his first channel or did it

4762.64 --> 4767.04
get deleted or something

4764.0 --> 4767.679
i don't know i think the only way to

4767.04 --> 4771.12
really know

4767.679 --> 4777.84
is to just ask him anyway uh

4771.12 --> 4777.84
i'll be back in two minutes

4816.84 --> 4819.84
um

4858.84 --> 4863.4490000000005
so

4860.37 --> 4863.449
[Music]

4879.12 --> 4883.76
oh god they believe in covet oh that's

4886.84 --> 4891.679
terrible

4889.12 --> 4893.599999999999
well terror 306 i'd say that that is

4891.679 --> 4903.84
much more problematic than them

4893.6 --> 4903.84
not believing in flat earth

4903.92 --> 4917.84
100 mainstream slaves

4937.12 --> 4942.88
oh god he's not you got a karen after

4940.639 --> 4942.88
you

4943.199 --> 4945.839999999999
that's terrible

4948.56 --> 4963.52
did they never come after me though

4959.52 --> 4965.84
like i still go to my supermarket

4963.52 --> 4968.0
and really i'm the only one not wearing

4965.84 --> 4970.88
a mask there

4968.0 --> 4972.48
it's just i've noticed that like say a

4970.88 --> 4974.159000000001
month ago

4972.48 --> 4976.32
there would still be some people in

4974.159 --> 4979.36
there that would go in without a mask

4976.32 --> 4982.96
but now i just everybody

4979.36 --> 4984.719
is doing that it's almost like a habit

4982.96 --> 4986.56
like they're now associating just going

4984.719 --> 4988.32
into the supermarket with having to wear

4986.56 --> 4989.76
a mask so they just do it they don't

4988.32 --> 4993.5199999999995
even

4989.76 --> 4993.52
figure out if they really have to

4995.36 --> 4998.88
and i just go in there without and i see

4997.6 --> 5002.0
all the people

4998.88 --> 5003.6
they all look at me like like yeah i'm

5002.0 --> 5005.12
not wearing masks and they're just like

5003.6 --> 5008.159000000001
they don't even know

5005.12 --> 5012.32
what to say about it so they just

5008.159 --> 5015.599999999999
ignore me yes okay it's like yeah

5012.32 --> 5017.5199999999995
i'm a non-masked person in a store where

5015.6 --> 5020.400000000001
everybody's wearing masks

5017.52 --> 5022.8
and nobody's even addressing it it's

5020.4 --> 5025.36
kind of weird

5022.8 --> 5026.08
but i'm fine with it i'm fine with being

5025.36 --> 5028.0
ignored

5026.08 --> 5029.28
that's great then i at least can just

5028.0 --> 5032.08
focus on

5029.28 --> 5032.719
getting the food and like smelling it

5032.08 --> 5034.639
you know

5032.719 --> 5036.4800000000005
good reason not to wear a mask you want

5034.639 --> 5039.679
to smell it like hey

5036.48 --> 5040.239
is this fruit ripe does it smell right

5039.679 --> 5042.56
yeah

5040.239 --> 5056.379999999999
yeah wearing a mask is not very handy

5042.56 --> 5059.43
for grocery shopping

5056.38 --> 5059.43
[Music]

5060.08 --> 5066.719
besides i love all the smells in the in

5062.8 --> 5070.4800000000005
the organic grocery store i love it

5066.719 --> 5072.56
it's part of the experience it smells so

5070.48 --> 5076.718999999999
much better than in a regular

5072.56 --> 5076.719
grocery store so much better

5077.76 --> 5082.4800000000005
like the candy aisle

5080.96 --> 5085.679
which you normally have in normal

5082.48 --> 5088.718999999999
grocery stores and like

5085.679 --> 5092.32
just clean aid cleaning agents

5088.719 --> 5095.04
like all those things like they stink

5092.32 --> 5097.28
terribly they smell all over the store

5095.04 --> 5099.199
in a regular supermarket

5097.28 --> 5101.28
and i always found find that very

5099.199 --> 5103.199
repulsive it just feels like i'm walking

5101.28 --> 5106.0
into a store where there's just poison

5103.199 --> 5107.36
gas everywhere so i didn't don't want to

5106.0 --> 5110.0
hang around too long

5107.36 --> 5111.04
well in the organic supermarket there is

5110.0 --> 5114.96
none of that

5111.04 --> 5119.199
none at all it doesn't stink

5114.96 --> 5122.08
like perfume or artificial taste

5119.199 --> 5141.839999999999
artificial smell things it's just great

5122.08 --> 5141.84
i love it actually smells like food

5150.239 --> 5156.879999999999
all right yeah tara 306 i i saw that

5154.56 --> 5159.84
there were some really weird spectacles

5156.88 --> 5162.2390000000005
from india a while back

5159.84 --> 5163.679
i think i remember that like in january

5162.239 --> 5165.839999999999
last year

5163.679 --> 5167.12
where there was footage of literally

5165.84 --> 5170.8
police officers

5167.12 --> 5172.96
just hitting people with sticks

5170.8 --> 5174.8
to get them inside of their homes

5172.96 --> 5178.159
because it was a lockdown

5174.8 --> 5179.12
like what the hell i guess that's how

5178.159 --> 5183.44
they do things in

5179.12 --> 5186.8
india that was really weird

5183.44 --> 5188.638999999999
like just indian police people just

5186.8 --> 5190.88
battering people with sticks to get

5188.639 --> 5192.0
inside their houses because of a covet

5190.88 --> 5197.84
lockdown

5192.0 --> 5197.84
that was really weird

5204.159 --> 5208.879999999999
i don't know if you've seen anything of

5205.679 --> 5210.719
that terror 306 maybe that's

5208.88 --> 5214.2390000000005
other types of neighborhoods i don't

5210.719 --> 5225.84
know it looked pretty poor

5214.239 --> 5225.839999999999
in that footage

5231.04 --> 5235.679
covet costumes oh right yeah the weird

5233.44 --> 5240.239
covet police helmets

5235.679 --> 5243.52
yes i remember that that was so bizarre

5240.239 --> 5246.5599999999995
like these police officers just with

5243.52 --> 5250.320000000001
virus helmets on what the [ __ ]

5246.56 --> 5253.6
that was so idiotic it was like yeah

5250.32 --> 5255.44
they actually thought it was cool

5253.6 --> 5256.88
serious like they they thought it was

5255.44 --> 5260.159
cool to wear that

5256.88 --> 5260.159000000001
i don't get it

5262.4 --> 5267.839999999999
i remember that

5277.36 --> 5281.839999999999
secondhand smoke

5285.76 --> 5288.88
it depends on what you're smoking if

5287.679 --> 5292.2390000000005
you're gonna smoke

5288.88 --> 5295.6
pre prefabricated

5292.239 --> 5296.799999999999
bad quality cigarettes yeah that's not

5295.6 --> 5298.8
going to be healthy is this

5296.8 --> 5302.08
bad for the one that's smoking it as

5298.8 --> 5305.6
anybody that's in their presence

5302.08 --> 5306.639
and yeah i definitely if i'd ever had

5305.6 --> 5309.84
kids i would

5306.639 --> 5309.84
keep it away from them

5311.52 --> 5315.52
i remember that i that it really

5313.76 --> 5316.4800000000005
burdened me as a kid to be in the

5315.52 --> 5318.56
presence of

5316.48 --> 5319.919999999999
people that were smoking when it was

5318.56 --> 5323.360000000001
inside

5319.92 --> 5325.36
so also because of that i just

5323.36 --> 5328.5599999999995
universally decided to never be an

5325.36 --> 5330.5599999999995
inside smoker i always smoke outside

5328.56 --> 5332.8
or if it's like terrible weather then at

5330.56 --> 5337.84
least i'll just try to stay in the open

5332.8 --> 5337.84
door or something

5369.36 --> 5379.839999999999
right having smoking rooms yeah that

5371.84 --> 5379.84
would be sensible

5395.92 --> 5400.08
they used to allow smoking on planes

5402.08 --> 5405.6
that's hilarious can you imagine in that

5404.08 --> 5407.199
time

5405.6 --> 5409.679
there might have been people that would

5407.199 --> 5411.28
literally just bring a joint with them

5409.679 --> 5412.4800000000005
and light those up

5411.28 --> 5414.96
that they would smuggle in their

5412.48 --> 5416.879999999999
cigarette pack or something

5414.96 --> 5420.08
and then everybody would be getting high

5416.88 --> 5423.84
but they wouldn't even know what it is

5420.08 --> 5435.84
because they never smelled it before

5423.84 --> 5435.84
that's not gonna happen anymore

5446.84 --> 5449.84
right

5454.88 --> 5459.28
right but you know what i think that why

5457.44 --> 5462.799999999999
not

5459.28 --> 5465.679
because smoking helps or well smokers

5462.8 --> 5468.08
that have to not smoke for a period are

5465.679 --> 5470.0
very uncomfortable because of it

5468.08 --> 5471.6
so i think that there should be smoking

5470.0 --> 5473.52
compartments even in planes

5471.6 --> 5477.52
just get a good ventilation system and

5473.52 --> 5479.92
keep it separate

5477.52 --> 5479.92
so that

5481.92 --> 5486.4800000000005
yeah i don't know maybe you could uh

5484.719 --> 5487.6
it's complicated i don't know the layout

5486.48 --> 5489.199
of a plane

5487.6 --> 5490.639
but almost like you could have a

5489.199 --> 5493.12
separate

5490.639 --> 5493.76
compartment so that you wouldn't be

5493.12 --> 5497.04
allowed to

5493.76 --> 5499.6
light up a cigarette until the takeoff

5497.04 --> 5500.239
and then it would be truly separated

5499.6 --> 5502.400000000001
like air

5500.239 --> 5504.239
almost airtight separated so no smoke

5502.4 --> 5507.04
can leak

5504.239 --> 5508.08
in the non-smoke area and then yeah have

5507.04 --> 5511.12
your own

5508.08 --> 5519.679
have a separate bathroom even for the

5511.12 --> 5522.159
smokers area

5519.679 --> 5524.4
have them on trains well with trains

5522.159 --> 5527.44
it's different

5524.4 --> 5528.32
because yeah in the trains you can't set

5527.44 --> 5531.44
up that

5528.32 --> 5533.36
proper type of isolation

5531.44 --> 5535.599999999999
yeah the old trains yeah i know

5533.36 --> 5536.719
everybody there was always smoking

5535.6 --> 5541.120000000001
things everywhere

5536.719 --> 5544.159
it's gone away it's all gone away

5541.12 --> 5546.48
that's right it's not what it used to be

5544.159 --> 5548.719
there's no more smoking freedom that's

5546.48 --> 5548.718999999999
right

5550.32 --> 5557.44
and you can't get it back

5554.4 --> 5558.08
just for the record right it's not gonna

5557.44 --> 5560.799999999999
return

5558.08 --> 5562.96
ever it's not gonna happen it's not

5560.8 --> 5565.28
gonna be done

5562.96 --> 5566.719
you understand that there's too much

5565.28 --> 5568.159
people that have been conditioned

5566.719 --> 5570.56
against it to ever

5568.159 --> 5571.28
get it back it's never gonna be that way

5570.56 --> 5574.400000000001
again

5571.28 --> 5576.08
so get over it i mean it get over it's

5574.4 --> 5580.719
never gonna return

5576.08 --> 5582.96
but when it comes to airplanes

5580.719 --> 5585.84
yeah if you'd have to sit in an airplane

5582.96 --> 5588.8
for a very long time and you can't smoke

5585.84 --> 5590.76
right yeah that can be a hassle so there

5588.8 --> 5593.76
might be something for

5590.76 --> 5596.0
reintroducing it but more isolated to

5593.76 --> 5598.4800000000005
really have a smoker's seat

5596.0 --> 5599.84
in an isolated part so that non-smokers

5598.48 --> 5604.32
cannot possibly

5599.84 --> 5608.2390000000005
even pick up the scent of it

5604.32 --> 5610.159
properly isolated ventilated areas

5608.239 --> 5611.5199999999995
with their own bathroom because if

5610.159 --> 5612.879999999999
you're going to share a bathroom with

5611.52 --> 5615.120000000001
non-smokers then

5612.88 --> 5616.0
there there is a yeah there's no proper

5615.12 --> 5619.36
isolation there

5616.0 --> 5623.12
will be issues and that way

5619.36 --> 5624.719
maybe yeah it can make it a little

5623.12 --> 5627.76
easier on the smokers

5624.719 --> 5627.76
in airplane travel

5629.44 --> 5635.599999999999
do i think cancer is real well that

5632.4 --> 5638.879999999999
depends on what you think cancer is

5635.6 --> 5640.400000000001
but yeah the process associated with

5638.88 --> 5643.4400000000005
cancer

5640.4 --> 5645.92
those things happen yeah

5643.44 --> 5647.759999999999
the actual cancer cells as they're

5645.92 --> 5650.159
called everybody's born with like at

5647.76 --> 5651.84
least 20 different types

5650.159 --> 5653.759999999999
which they have in their body at all

5651.84 --> 5659.84
times during their entire lifetime

5653.76 --> 5659.84
yes i believe in cancer

5664.239 --> 5672.638999999999
i do not believe in western approach of

5667.28 --> 5674.4
cancer treatment though

5672.639 --> 5677.12
because they treat it like it's some

5674.4 --> 5679.839999999999
kind of malfunctioning

5677.12 --> 5679.84
mutation

5680.159 --> 5683.28
and i don't think it's that

5683.6 --> 5688.08
there's other ways of dealing with it

5685.52 --> 5692.400000000001
many many other ways

5688.08 --> 5692.4
than mainstream cancer treatment

5693.4 --> 5699.28
[Music]

5696.0 --> 5701.84
there's even like non-interventionist

5699.28 --> 5702.5599999999995
types of treatment yeah because of the

5701.84 --> 5706.159000000001
other approach

5702.56 --> 5709.76
which focuses much more on psychology

5706.159 --> 5712.48
of it and the german new medicine

5709.76 --> 5713.4400000000005
is one of these systems that was even

5712.48 --> 5718.48
originally

5713.44 --> 5718.48
created in relation to cancer

5719.28 --> 5729.84
that's what made it develop

5737.6 --> 5743.84
vitamin b19 what

5771.76 --> 5774.88
oh you mean apricot

5775.04 --> 5780.8
um i heard of that

5778.48 --> 5782.159
patricia steer actually did a show on

5780.8 --> 5784.400000000001
that

5782.159 --> 5786.0
a couple of times that was like a year

5784.4 --> 5789.679
ago

5786.0 --> 5792.32
i think or was it even further

5789.679 --> 5795.679
though it could be several years ago

5792.32 --> 5798.08
before she deleted her original channel

5795.679 --> 5800.88
but she did bring that up apricot seeds

5798.08 --> 5800.88
is interesting

5806.0 --> 5810.8
vitamin b17 what kent hovind

5811.36 --> 5815.92
he believes it is a panacea okey dokey

5823.84 --> 5827.84
cyanide really

5833.44 --> 5841.839999999999
was that it specifically

5842.56 --> 5844.96
all right

5846.08 --> 5850.0
why oh okay well there's cyanide in many

5849.04 --> 5853.04
different types of

5850.0 --> 5854.0
nuts i would i don't even know why you

5853.04 --> 5858.719
would have to go for

5854.0 --> 5858.719
apricot seeds that way

5861.52 --> 5869.84
like uh almonds have cyanide in them

5865.28 --> 5869.84
it's like well known

5873.84 --> 5880.08
hey adam meekin saya no

5876.96 --> 5883.76

or is it like a

5887.119 --> 5892.08
ah wait no that's methylcobalamin

5889.56 --> 5893.84
cyanogen okay

5892.08 --> 5896.08

5893.84 --> 5911.84
ask the chemist adam meekin he

5896.08 --> 5911.84

5964.56 --> 5968.159000000001
oh rick simpson oil right

5971.679 --> 5979.04
that's like yeah that's the

5975.679 --> 5982.56
cannabis resin concentrate right

5979.04 --> 5984.88
the stuff that you work with

5982.56 --> 5985.6
yeah that that definitely happens but

5984.88 --> 5988.96
that had

5985.6 --> 5991.4400000000005
that helps not just

5988.96 --> 5995.84
against cancer i would say it helps for

5991.44 --> 5995.839999999999
a whole lot of things

6002.22 --> 6005.829000000001

6140.639 --> 6142.4800000000005
the

6140.85 --> 6144.719
[Music]

6142.48 --> 6147.36
mind out yeah the mind influencing

6144.719 --> 6152.639
aspect of it

6147.36 --> 6152.639
so that way they prevent getting hassle

6155.679 --> 6159.92
weed in the uk is [ __ ] too much jc well

6158.4 --> 6163.839999999999
that's not just the uk

6159.92 --> 6163.84
it's it's everywhere

6173.6 --> 6179.92
but there's also there's notice of this

6177.52 --> 6182.159000000001
that's why in coffee shops here in the

6179.92 --> 6185.36
netherlands for example

6182.159 --> 6188.638999999999
there's always the strong ones

6185.36 --> 6191.839999999999
and those yeah those are the most

6188.639 --> 6191.84
profitable in ways

6195.04 --> 6202.239
every coffee shop also has lower thc

6198.56 --> 6202.2390000000005
strength cannabis they always do

6202.48 --> 6204.49
all the ones that i've come across so

6204.159 --> 6206.32
far

6204.49 --> 6208.639
[Music]

6206.32 --> 6209.679
because not everybody likes the

6208.639 --> 6212.96
strongest stuff

6209.679 --> 6215.4400000000005
all the time or ever some people are

6212.96 --> 6216.96
just very sensitive to that

6215.44 --> 6233.839999999999
i personally don't really like the

6216.96 --> 6233.84
strongest stuff either

6245.6 --> 6261.84
right anyway

6272.84 --> 6275.84
so

6286.84 --> 6289.84
hmm

6300.84 --> 6303.84
hmm

6304.48 --> 6311.339999999999
yeah chemistry class yeah little welcome

6307.679 --> 6314.669
that's adam meekin he knows what he's

6311.34 --> 6314.669
[Music]

6314.84 --> 6317.84
doing

6318.719 --> 6321.92
maybe one day i'll do something like

6321.04 --> 6325.76
that too

6321.92 --> 6325.76
but i'd have to have a good place for it

6326.09 --> 6331.92
[Music]

6328.639 --> 6334.719
why not a lot of people are going to be

6331.92 --> 6337.6
complaining about the smell which yeah

6334.719 --> 6337.6
that does happen

6338.239 --> 6345.839999999999
unless you have a super special

6341.6 --> 6345.84
filter set up which is kind of expensive

6373.39 --> 6376.539000000001
[Music]

6384.84 --> 6391.76
hmm

6386.56 --> 6391.76
what was my favorite science subject in

6398.84 --> 6401.84
school

6402.48 --> 6405.36
it's hard to tell

6409.119 --> 6415.839999999999
do i have to have a favorite subject

6424.48 --> 6428.239
i just physics in general i was just

6426.96 --> 6431.28
interested in it

6428.239 --> 6435.36
just the the fundamentals

6431.28 --> 6435.36
the basics i like the basics a lot

6438.159 --> 6443.36
never been too much a fan of electronics

6441.6 --> 6445.360000000001
just kind of unfortunate because it

6443.36 --> 6446.96
would have been good to to become good

6445.36 --> 6450.08
at it

6446.96 --> 6452.96
and yeah well

6450.08 --> 6454.719
anything chemistry i was like chemistry

6452.96 --> 6458.08
even though i didn't

6454.719 --> 6459.76
like uh graduate on that didn't have it

6458.08 --> 6462.88
in my package in the end

6459.76 --> 6462.88
i did like chemistry

6464.639 --> 6471.84
especially the practical sides of it

6483.36 --> 6485.679
hmm

6491.44 --> 6499.839999999999
putin butane tube extracting what

6495.76 --> 6499.84
what is that

6504.639 --> 6510.2390000000005
oh god yeah breaking bad is not

6510.84 --> 6513.84
good

6516.239 --> 6520.5599999999995
like as a series i thought it was good

6519.44 --> 6527.839999999999
it's not good

6520.56 --> 6527.84
though it does give you bad ideas

6529.76 --> 6533.360000000001
what are my thoughts on alchemy

6538.96 --> 6543.52
but i have had a thought about alchemy

6541.36 --> 6545.759999999999
but it's not really original

6543.52 --> 6546.719
just the basic thing of turning lead

6545.76 --> 6550.2390000000005
into gold

6546.719 --> 6553.36
it's about war and what i think

6550.239 --> 6555.04
i would probably arise is that at some

6553.36 --> 6559.92
point

6555.04 --> 6562.239
the the age of steel

6559.92 --> 6563.04
weapons and armor was kind of at its

6562.239 --> 6566.239
peak

6563.04 --> 6569.28
and then chemists were just tasked on

6566.239 --> 6572.0
trying to turn lead into gold

6569.28 --> 6573.599
or that is what they started calling it

6572.0 --> 6574.639
because chemists were basically

6573.599 --> 6578.719
developing

6574.639 --> 6580.88
gunpowder and cast lead bullets

6578.719 --> 6582.719
like they probably were tasked to

6580.88 --> 6586.4800000000005
develop

6582.719 --> 6589.119
something that would break through

6586.48 --> 6591.199
armor and all that and that's what

6589.119 --> 6593.5199999999995
became known as turning lead into gold

6591.199 --> 6594.839999999999
it's basically the transition from the

6593.52 --> 6600.56
knights

6594.84 --> 6600.56
age into the musketeer age

6602.8 --> 6611.84
and that's turning lead into gold it's

6604.32 --> 6611.84
one of the alchemy things

6634.48 --> 6639.839999999999
sp gyrix what

6641.04 --> 6646.88
mono atomic gold uh

6645.119 --> 6653.839999999999
what kind of thoughts do would i have to

6646.88 --> 6653.84
have about it

6663.679 --> 6670.56
i had i used to have like colloidal goat

6666.8 --> 6673.1990000000005
gold like there's colloidal silver for

6670.56 --> 6674.639
uh for immune system support and all

6673.199 --> 6677.839999999999
that and

6674.639 --> 6680.0
like topic to help healing

6677.84 --> 6681.28
and prevent infection well there was

6680.0 --> 6683.76
also

6681.28 --> 6685.28
colloidal gold and i used to take that

6683.76 --> 6688.719
under the guys that

6685.28 --> 6692.159
it would make you smarter

6688.719 --> 6695.44
well it did do something

6692.159 --> 6697.36
that was kind of good now i don't know

6695.44 --> 6699.839999999999
if yeah in retrospect so i was like can

6697.36 --> 6702.96
you actually attribute it to that

6699.84 --> 6705.92
or was it more like placebo

6702.96 --> 6705.92
driving me

6706.159 --> 6710.08
to unlock the skills that were dormant

6709.04 --> 6713.199
already there

6710.08 --> 6715.199
it's kind of hard to tell

6713.199 --> 6716.5599999999995
but i have taken colloidal gold in the

6715.199 --> 6723.839999999999
past

6716.56 --> 6723.84
around 2008

6746.48 --> 6751.839999999999
plant alchemy what

6779.28 --> 6793.84
gold schlager i don't know what that is

6804.84 --> 6807.84
one

6812.639 --> 6821.84
oh yeah well that's not going to enhance

6815.84 --> 6821.84
your intelligence at all

6822.0 --> 6825.92
and i think yeah i think you mean gold

6824.8 --> 6828.8
strike right

6825.92 --> 6828.8
that junk

6875.92 --> 6880.96
right so i'm gonna be rounding out the

6878.32 --> 6880.96
show soon

6884.239 --> 6887.5199999999995
i know yeah yeah we know that is gold

6886.719 --> 6891.84
striking

6887.52 --> 6894.959000000001
over here adios

6891.84 --> 6894.959
[Music]

6903.52 --> 6908.080000000001
it does not look like colloidal elixirs

6906.8 --> 6910.8
at all

6908.08 --> 6914.48
there's flakes in it colloidal stuff is

6910.8 --> 6914.4800000000005
per definition not flakes

6914.96 --> 6920.96
it's on an atomic level dissolved so

6918.8 --> 6925.1990000000005
you don't see flakes you can only even

6920.96 --> 6925.199
see it if you shine a laser on it

6926.159 --> 6933.839999999999
with the colloidal gold and silver that

6930.84 --> 6933.84
is

6940.159 --> 6947.44
do i think the balloon well only one way

6942.8 --> 6950.639
to find out i'm gonna bring it up

6947.44 --> 6951.759999999999
but yeah i the subject i brought the

6950.639 --> 6955.84
subject

6951.76 --> 6958.639
up like a few weeks ago

6955.84 --> 6960.08
as an idea like what would happen well

6958.639 --> 6962.32
here is the answer to

6960.08 --> 6963.679
that with the video so i'm definitely

6962.32 --> 6975.84
going to bring that up

6963.679 --> 6975.84
as a continuation the previous process

6979.599 --> 6982.8
on the other hand i don't know if i'm

6981.04 --> 6986.159
going to be there

6982.8 --> 6986.159000000001
the first half of the show

6986.32 --> 6989.36
we'll see because i really want to do

6988.32 --> 6991.679
some groceries

6989.36 --> 6994.88
preferably before it gets dark because

6991.679 --> 6994.88
it's already so cold

6996.639 --> 7002.4800000000005
so maybe they'll turn into an after show

6998.719 --> 7004.88
discussion i don't know for sure but

7002.48 --> 7006.799999999999
on the other hand nathan oakley might

7004.88 --> 7007.52
have picked up on it because he was here

7006.8 --> 7009.119000000001
in chat

7007.52 --> 7012.0
in the beginning and i brought it up

7009.119 --> 7012.0
pretty early

7012.159 --> 7016.08
so it depends it depends on how crowded

7014.4 --> 7018.799999999999
it's going to be if everybody's all

7016.08 --> 7018.8
ready to

7020.88 --> 7026.8
to bring up subjects so it might be a

7022.96 --> 7026.8
little bit crowded i don't know we'll

7028.84 --> 7031.84
see

7042.239 --> 7047.119
all right well yeah i'm gonna round out

7045.92 --> 7050.8
