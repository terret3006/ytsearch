wondering I do kind of keep track of

your overall chat behaviors in other

190.77 --> 198.39000000000001
places as well so everybody that's in my

194.28 --> 208.37
chat I keep an eye on you just so you

198.39 --> 212.16

208.37 --> 214.17000000000002
so yeah today's Saturday so could have

212.16 --> 216.23
potentially a long show we'll see how it

214.17 --> 216.23
goes

227.97 --> 233.25
yeah Robin Stanley you have nothing to

230.04 --> 237.78
worry about I think I've seen from you

233.25 --> 239.3
so far you are awesome yeah I know

237.78 --> 242.34
you're watching me too

239.3 --> 246.36
and I and everybody knows I can get a

242.34 --> 253.5
bit nutty too at times or like

246.36 --> 260.22
overheated especially in the Friday

253.5 --> 265.47
evenings Evil's name is Charlie what no

260.22 --> 270.05
I'm not stalkerish I just look I'm

265.47 --> 275.58000000000004
trying to accomplish like a good

270.05 --> 278.49
tranquil setting for my chat but in

275.58 --> 280.59
order to do that to know what it means

278.49 --> 283.44
when somebody says something I have to

280.59 --> 287.52
understand what they do in general so I

283.44 --> 291.18
pick up on that so I know can better

287.52 --> 293.25
judge what what it is like they are

291.18 --> 296.81
doing if they're just flipping out for

293.25 --> 300.24
something or if they are just yeah

296.81 --> 304.23
perpetuating bad behavior sadly on a

300.24 --> 306.06
regular basis so alright yeah a joke

304.23 --> 308.27000000000004
yeah you know how I am with that kind of

306.06 --> 308.27
[ __ ]

308.3 --> 322.5
hmm you know some teachers I remember do

316.14 --> 324.93
sort of that as well like teachers that

322.5 --> 327.8
care greatly for their students and

324.93 --> 327.8
especially their

330.43 --> 337.21
not just in general if somebody needs

334.33 --> 339.55
some extra help then I've had teachers

337.21 --> 343.57
that would contact my parents as well

339.55 --> 347.65000000000003
and try to really understand what this

343.57 --> 353.639
is because I'm especially when I was

347.65 --> 353.63899999999995
young it was very strange to everyone I

355.02 --> 364.26
would often have like this neurotic

359.25 --> 366.76
defiant attitude but that would always

364.26 --> 370.06
but I was just an attitude because I

366.76 --> 375.4
wasn't actually very cooperative it's

370.06 --> 381.75
very that was just weird you know it was

375.4 --> 384.4
not like other people my age so yeah

381.75 --> 385.59
right oh yeah by the way that was weird

384.4 --> 388.29999999999995
man

385.59 --> 390.96999999999997
when I started up the early bird show

388.3 --> 392.83
usually on the YouTube page it starts

390.97 --> 396.66
out with an advertisement most of the

392.83 --> 402.82
time and this time it was a weird

396.66 --> 405.53900000000004
advertisement like really weird I don't

402.82 --> 410.229
know why I did that

405.539 --> 412.75
it seemed to be yeah some kind of well

410.229 --> 415.93
child advertisement so it seems and I

412.75 --> 419.199
wonder like why you know I'm not

415.93 --> 423.13
I've never clicked on anything really in

419.199 --> 426.03000000000003
that direction I don't get it so I

423.13 --> 426.03
wonder what they're doing

431.21 --> 436.5
if any of you noticed that kind of

434.4 --> 438.69
advertisements popping up for you as

436.5 --> 440.97
well on my channel while you watch my

438.69 --> 448.169
stuff you I would like to be notified

440.97 --> 455.16
about that because that potentially

448.169 --> 458.13
could get me in trouble I think under

455.16 --> 460.43
these weird circumstances that YouTube

458.13 --> 460.43
is in

466.57 --> 470.76
zero heads hmm

472.91 --> 480.05
mainstream political ads well you're in

476.69 --> 482.96
the US right because we we don't get any

480.05 --> 485.98
of that here usually the advertisements

482.96 --> 490.94
that I get to see a lot of the time for

485.98 --> 493.52000000000004
for some other reason are like theme

490.94 --> 495.11
parks like yeah go to this theme park

493.52 --> 501.09999999999997
like all summer it was that

495.11 --> 501.1
advertisement that I got to see this and

501.16 --> 514.61
oh yeah things like cars to technology

508.96 --> 519.3489999999999
stuff phones a lot of code vert Iseman

514.61 --> 521.63
for phones but that yeah that seems kind

519.349 --> 524.24
of normal that seemed seems kind of

521.63 --> 527.99
normal for what they would try to aim at

524.24 --> 533.84
my public pretty typical Ange age range

527.99 --> 537.41
that I have was anyway thought that was

533.84 --> 539.62
a little weird not too much to say about

537.41 --> 539.62
it

543.04 --> 549.12
okay now are vegans healthy

552.19 --> 555.0290000000001
what the

563.84 --> 566.59
hmm

576.56 --> 579.91
what how does this

580.12 --> 584.829
oh right right sorry I'm just screwing

582.999 --> 587.139
around with YouTube and I apparently

584.829 --> 588.79
pinned a tab and I've never seen that

587.139 --> 594.36
before so I got a bit confused

588.79 --> 594.36
couldn't get it away yeah

594.87 --> 601.149
community post no I haven't seen it

599.11 --> 603.4300000000001
Ragnar Stefan Hollis and I heard about

601.149 --> 606.279
it in the master beat chat he was

603.43 --> 606.79
talking about something there I don't

606.279 --> 615.309
know

606.79 --> 620.49
oh yeah and by the way I kind of did put

615.309 --> 624.04
the deed to the word yesterday and I had

620.49 --> 631.9300000000001
yeah the meal that that I said I would

624.04 --> 635.5889999999999
with with beef based sausage and yeah I

631.93 --> 638.319
I I was kind of careful at first eating

635.589 --> 643.509
it but I just noticed like my body was

638.319 --> 645.61
like yeah Ram that [ __ ] in there so I

643.509 --> 649.6
actually ended up eating literally a

645.61 --> 652.149
double meal so I was kind of right I

649.6 --> 655.4390000000001
guess my body just needed that and now

652.149 --> 658.689
I'm not like oh yeah I want more no it's

655.439 --> 661.059
it seems to have hit that spot although

658.689 --> 663.759
for a long run and now I'm just gonna

661.059 --> 665.9699999999999
continue probably eating what I have

663.759 --> 665.97
been

669.79 --> 681.0999999999999
yeah yeah I was on ran teased by the way

672.22 --> 686.1700000000001
yesterday yesterday evening wasn't about

681.1 --> 690.19
again oh yeah I was but weird racism

686.17 --> 699.79
accusations over some strange fringe

690.19 --> 705.6400000000001
leftists cold thing paranoia is Randy

699.79 --> 708.76
still relevant well that that depends on

705.64 --> 712.33
what he does I don't know I'm getting a

708.76 --> 718.06
better vibe of Randy then like before

712.33 --> 720.9100000000001
the long break so I don't know you know

718.06 --> 724.54
what happened in the past happened I'm

720.91 --> 726.85
not just gonna try to forget that but I

724.54 --> 729.49
don't know I thought it was pretty good

726.85 --> 733.5400000000001
yesterday and Randy also just seems to

729.49 --> 738.82
be a lot nicer to me right at least just

733.54 --> 739.03
not poking and [ __ ] and I thank him for

738.82 --> 741.9000000000001
that

739.03 --> 741.9
genuinely

759.4 --> 770.4
got a soup what what can you please say

766.6 --> 770.4
that in proper English right artherton

778.3 --> 783.0089999999999
what yeah

784.11 --> 799.2
Oh supplement protein I don't know I

792.41 --> 801.24
really don't know if I need that you

799.2 --> 807.12
know I'm already getting omega fats from

801.24 --> 810.36
fish oil that I take every day but I

807.12 --> 815.85
think a plenty of protein it's just

810.36 --> 818.27
different type of protein oh yeah Amanda

815.85 --> 822.03
you know it it was so ridiculous it's

818.27 --> 823.8
it's almost it is kind of embarrassing

822.03 --> 827.55
to me to even bring it up because it's

823.8 --> 832.89
so ridiculous it's it's comparable to

827.55 --> 835.43
ballers getting all pissy about somebody

832.89 --> 839.93
saying something a detail wrong in their

835.43 --> 842.8199999999999
high priest presuppositional deep things

839.93 --> 845.28
that they talk about on that level it's

842.82 --> 847.2900000000001
just so stupid but what basically

845.28 --> 849.8
happened is that Nathan during one of

847.29 --> 854.2199999999999
his rants against kosher

849.8 --> 856.53
apparently reminded people in his

854.22 --> 859.4100000000001
authoritarian voice because yeah he is

856.53 --> 862.38
and he said he takes the strict teacher

859.41 --> 864.06
route and to be fair I really respect

862.38 --> 867.12
that when he does it when he does it

864.06 --> 870.63
right and sometimes takes it little he

867.12 --> 873.12
gets a little bit too angry but yeah hey

870.63 --> 874.86
easy easy man he didn't get he's not

873.12 --> 876.72
even a teacher really so it's just the

874.86 --> 878.88
thing that he does and when he does well

876.72 --> 883.28
it's very interesting but apparently

878.88 --> 886.68
some people in chat interpreted

883.28 --> 890.73
something what he said he said like do

886.68 --> 894.54
you understand boy and that apparently

890.73 --> 896.73
is like oh people in the extreme fringe

894.54 --> 899.0699999999999
paranoid left thought have been

896.73 --> 902.99
discussing that when you say that boy

899.07 --> 908.9100000000001
that that is supposed to reflect upon a

902.99 --> 911.61
certain racist spell a way of addressing

908.91 --> 913.61
blacks that the Nazis did or something

911.61 --> 915.98
in some movie yeah

913.61 --> 918.649
yeah it's that stupid it's total

915.98 --> 921.44
paranoia nonsense you know the left

918.649 --> 923.63
decides all the time what kind of things

921.44 --> 926.6300000000001
are supposed to be racist they even said

923.63 --> 927.649
that milk was racist and just so

926.63 --> 931.22
ridiculous

927.649 --> 933.35
so it's it's just embarrassing but yeah

931.22 --> 935.779
that it was mentioned for a while and

933.35 --> 937.91
also that Nathan yeah didn't even

935.779 --> 942.25
realize that Kosho was black I knew it

937.91 --> 949.9699999999999
for a while but I think the craziest

942.25 --> 952.519
really it's it's really silly because us

949.97 --> 955.399
flat-earthers and our arguments and our

952.519 --> 959.24
study within the arguments we are so

955.399 --> 961.82
much winning it would just be [ __ ]

959.24 --> 964.1
to even go there even if you felt that

961.82 --> 969.44
way in some way and I don't think that

964.1 --> 971.72
any of us do well at least on the Flat

969.44 --> 973.49
Earth debates team so far you know we

971.72 --> 977.089
have encountered individuals that were

973.49 --> 980.149
particularly are allergic to Jews this

977.089 --> 982.399
is like overkill and that yeah you could

980.149 --> 985.579
you could consider that racist but yeah

982.399 --> 989.36
is it a really booty there you go but

985.579 --> 990.05
other than that like like anti black

989.36 --> 992.1800000000001
racism

990.05 --> 995.06
I haven't even come across that so far

992.18 --> 1000.6899999999999
at all not even single a single time not

995.06 --> 1004.42
even in secret or like in in offline

1000.69 --> 1007.899
messages or and no never so it's just

1004.42 --> 1012.329
ridiculous like what racism it's so so

1007.899 --> 1012.329
last century who do that

1012.54 --> 1016.1999999999999
[Music]

1013.85 --> 1018.4200000000001
now on the other hand if you're gonna

1016.2 --> 1020.9000000000001
say or if you're gonna talk about like

1018.42 --> 1024.3
hey yeah there seems to be this weird

1020.9 --> 1028.29
Liberals mechanism social engineering

1024.3 --> 1032.61
mechanism very widespread concerning

1028.29 --> 1038.9389999999999
policies media and politics it's a kind

1032.61 --> 1041.3999999999999
of mix all the like mix Intercontinental

1038.939 --> 1046.3700000000001
races it just almost forced displace

1041.4 --> 1046.3700000000001
them and just force everybody to mix up

1047.03 --> 1056.33
that is like maniacally anti-racist or

1053.01 --> 1059.73
super cultural diversity thinking and

1056.33 --> 1062.01
yeah I definitely like to speak out of

1059.73 --> 1064.22
against that because I don't like it and

1062.01 --> 1068.43
there's even been studies in Denmark now

1064.22 --> 1070.23
that have done long term studying and

1068.43 --> 1072.18
they're supposed to be like super

1070.23 --> 1075.24
liberal and they literally just found

1072.18 --> 1077.3400000000001
out like no it doesn't really work out

1075.24 --> 1081.54
well the stability actually goes down

1077.34 --> 1084.27
when you do that uniform groups just

1081.54 --> 1087.09
resonate better stay more stable more

1084.27 --> 1089.4
coherent that's what they figured out

1087.09 --> 1092.58
and yeah I called me a racist for

1089.4 --> 1094.5300000000002
pointing at that study done by people in

1092.58 --> 1098.01
a very liberal country Denmark

1094.53 --> 1100.5
well yeah I'm gonna speak out about that

1098.01 --> 1104.34
now call me a racist if you like really

1100.5 --> 1113.09
don't care I only care about the facts

1104.34 --> 1113.09
and I care about I don't know

1115.89 --> 1122.8200000000002
I even care in ways about the separate

1119.91 --> 1126.3600000000001
groups if like if they were if it were

1122.82 --> 1128.82
to be reverted and yep will it ever this

1126.36 --> 1133.85
point may be halted reverted like yeah

1128.82 --> 1138.559
so many people just now have this I

1133.85 --> 1143.34
don't know if you can or if he should I

1138.559 --> 1147.09
don't think so but I feel that there's

1143.34 --> 1149.01
just so many groups you could say tribes

1147.09 --> 1153.51
around the world that have their own

1149.01 --> 1158.19
unique little resonance thing with their

1153.51 --> 1161.61
genetics and I don't want those things

1158.19 --> 1165.66
to be lost the resonance within the

1161.61 --> 1167.85
genetic groups because of diversity and

1165.66 --> 1170.88
mixing in a lot big making it all

1167.85 --> 1174.5
chaotic and diffuse like the groups

1170.88 --> 1177.2700000000002
would lose those resonance abilities

1174.5 --> 1179.25
that are fine-tuned to their genetics

1177.27 --> 1184.1399999999999
yeah sounds weird doesn't it but I I

1179.25 --> 1187.59
believe in that i resonate very

1184.14 --> 1190.6200000000001
different with with people while from

1187.59 --> 1194.1599999999999
different races like i pick up different

1190.62 --> 1195.8999999999999
type of things from them feels and and i

1194.16 --> 1198.66
noticed different type of

1195.9 --> 1200.429
characteristics so yeah there's

1198.66 --> 1202.65
difference there's difference within the

1200.429 --> 1208.669
races i said it we're different

1202.65 --> 1208.669
oh yeah we're different but i don't mind

1219.8 --> 1227.18
the gin what's the Gentiles are many

1224.87 --> 1230.5
great why would you bring that up just a

1227.18 --> 1230.5
gem this is cheese

1236.94 --> 1247.39
even right right well that would be

1244.57 --> 1250.27
different and difficult because the as

1247.39 --> 1254.26
far as I know like a lot of different

1250.27 --> 1256.42
Asian groups really hate each other and

1254.26 --> 1258.76
have a bad history with one another so

1256.42 --> 1261.79
they're very distrustful and yeah they

1258.76 --> 1268.9
can even they've grown distrustful of

1261.79 --> 1271.21
that frequency of that you see it so to

1268.9 --> 1273.01
even all just group it together based on

1271.21 --> 1275.3500000000001
continent it is already kind of

1273.01 --> 1279.1
ridiculous you could say there is a

1275.35 --> 1282.6999999999998
spectrum effect like one group close to

1279.1 --> 1284.7099999999998
the other will be closer genetically and

1282.7 --> 1291.1000000000001
even frequency wise but could still be

1284.71 --> 1293.8
very off then like five groups along to

1291.1 --> 1299.1999999999998
the other side say from from range of

1293.8 --> 1301.96
China into Russia and then up into the

1299.2 --> 1304.8
Netherlands yes so different it's

1301.96 --> 1304.8
nothing like

1313.54 --> 1316.44
okay

1317.29 --> 1323.68
well Isaac's but I'm not I'm not really

1320.04 --> 1326.53
literally going by DNA strands here you

1323.68 --> 1329.74
know I'm not setting the boxes based on

1326.53 --> 1332.62
specific genetic traits I'm just looking

1329.74 --> 1336.34
at the preponderance of people's in

1332.62 --> 1338.4399999999998
their region what they roughly are like

1336.34 --> 1342.73
in the energy that hangs among them and

1338.44 --> 1344.38
how they have a special frequency among

1342.73 --> 1346.81
their people that they can attune to

1344.38 --> 1349.8700000000001
that they have an understanding of while

1346.81 --> 1352.02
others tend to oversee that overlooked

1349.87 --> 1352.02
that

1366.51 --> 1371.97
and I don't know maybe that has more to

1369.419 --> 1385.2
do with epigenetics I think that

1371.97 --> 1388.71
genetics is just to me when you look at

1385.2 --> 1390.6000000000001
genetics and you start to determine

1388.71 --> 1392.76
things considering that I'd almost say

1390.6 --> 1394.3799999999999
like yeah you're just studying their

1392.76 --> 1397.65
roots of the tree why don't you study

1394.38 --> 1399.38
the rest of it and then see what it does

1397.65 --> 1402.8400000000001
together and that is epigenetics

1399.38 --> 1406.7
epigenetics very critical it is probably

1402.84 --> 1406.6999999999998
the cornerstone of adaptation

1431.56 --> 1444.6299999999999
right a man do you want yeah like old

1438.99 --> 1450.85
cultures that that have been very alike

1444.63 --> 1452.65
fascinating and in a way also yeah even

1450.85 --> 1455.32
in the Netherlands there have been there

1452.65 --> 1458.0500000000002
has been attention for for other

1455.32 --> 1461.8
cultures Asian cultures especially in

1458.05 --> 1464.71
African cultures and I remember seeing

1461.8 --> 1469.29
programs in last 20 years where they

1464.71 --> 1472.45
would like go visit their and they just

1469.29 --> 1475.3
take a good look and talk to the people

1472.45 --> 1477.64
and ask things from a relatively

1475.3 --> 1481.24
sensible point of view not invasive at

1477.64 --> 1483.5700000000002
all and yeah that was very fascinating

1481.24 --> 1483.57
always

1485.79 --> 1488.98
[Music]

1510.43 --> 1514.8500000000001
[Music]

1512.0 --> 1518.68
right well Ryan Heffington you know you

1514.85 --> 1518.6799999999998
don't have to like all the cultures

1519.19 --> 1526.25
yeah there's depth like I you could

1523.91 --> 1529.3700000000001
point at almost any type of culture and

1526.25 --> 1531.08
just see like oh this is awesome or this

1529.37 --> 1532.9699999999998
is unique and then you pointed something

1531.08 --> 1538.4499999999998
else and like yeah that is just totally

1532.97 --> 1538.45
backwards why do they keep doing that or

1539.11 --> 1549.29
or like really slavish in some weird way

1543.43 --> 1553.27
yeah so every culture as upsides and

1549.29 --> 1557.12
downsides and sometimes severe downsides

1553.27 --> 1559.4
you know you could generally point at

1557.12 --> 1564.8
the US and you could point it out just

1559.4 --> 1567.74
as well you don't have to like them if

1564.8 --> 1570.4099999999999
if the bad sites just are too much for

1567.74 --> 1574.24
you yeah you know you shouldn't be

1570.41 --> 1574.24
forced to like that or even accept that

1574.54 --> 1581.54
but yeah if you're just gonna approach

1577.22 --> 1584.06
everything by by the nastiness that is

1581.54 --> 1589.51
somewhere then yeah you know you're

1584.06 --> 1589.51
gonna be pretty isolated you know

1613.68 --> 1617.0900000000001
nice exposed what

1619.27 --> 1626.049
i I'm not too sure I don't remember

1623.62 --> 1628.9189999999999
I probably were at that talking about

1626.049 --> 1628.9189999999999
the Bible right

1637.83 --> 1645.3899999999999
should own a few Wow

1641.27 --> 1647.87
now that is actually funny but that is a

1645.39 --> 1654.0590000000002
typical liberal joke that's just wrong

1647.87 --> 1658.1
because yeah but that yeah that I can

1654.059 --> 1658.1
actually appreciate that joke somewhat

1658.46 --> 1661.8500000000001
but it's wrong

1676.92 --> 1680.8100000000002
yeah my core work that's

1684.48 --> 1690.27
yeah yeah you know what I have like this

1688.26 --> 1692.97
on liberal joke of my own and that's

1690.27 --> 1699.42
kind of terrible really or it can be

1692.97 --> 1705.59
funny but if at some point for example

1699.42 --> 1708.48
in a group I get really was it cornered

1705.59 --> 1712.6499999999999
like I'm not popular about something or

1708.48 --> 1715.23
they don't trust me then to keep it

1712.65 --> 1716.67
light-hearted because I feel I feel

1715.23 --> 1719.4
really pissed off when that kind of

1716.67 --> 1721.5500000000002
thing happens but I'd now say like what

1719.4 --> 1729.0800000000002
is it because I wear all black

1721.55 --> 1733.6699999999998
you know that's my joke because I do

1729.08 --> 1733.6699999999998
it's because I'm wearing black isn't it

1733.75 --> 1743.21
[Music]

1736.58 --> 1743.21
but I haven't had that for a long time

1744.97 --> 1750.359
[Music]

1768.84 --> 1778.62
or lies exposed like liberalism yeah I

1775.08 --> 1784.309
guess if you call it liberalism but it

1778.62 --> 1789.09
is liberalism has become like a an

1784.309 --> 1793.499
ideological cult almost a cultural cult

1789.09 --> 1799.259
that's just been spreading in a position

1793.499 --> 1805.049
to just classical liberal liberalism to

1799.259 --> 1813.169
see the value of freedom but also try to

1805.049 --> 1815.7
be sensible and yeah be a good caretaker

1813.169 --> 1818.669
that's the Oh bleep but they they

1815.7 --> 1825.779
mutated this they they inserted

1818.669 --> 1828.779
communism into it piece by piece until

1825.779 --> 1831.179
it became very socialist and now it's

1828.779 --> 1833.69
just become fanatical now it's like

1831.179 --> 1836.8790000000001
taking on this religious fanatic

1833.69 --> 1840.1490000000001
approach where people literally dwell

1836.879 --> 1843.539
upon the machinations of it in order to

1840.149 --> 1845.6689999999999
avoid letting reality sink in so they're

1843.539 --> 1848.869
literally using it to distract

1845.669 --> 1851.519
themselves like they're trying to bypass

1848.869 --> 1853.59
reality isn't that how that feels when

1851.519 --> 1857.82
you see that that's because they do that

1853.59 --> 1863.249
they bypass reality they insert the

1857.82 --> 1865.649
machination the social construct that

1863.249 --> 1867.809
they play with virtually among their

1865.649 --> 1870.9899999999998
peers and they put it out there and they

1867.809 --> 1874.71
try to use it as a weapon but they also

1870.99 --> 1877.44
use it not let reality of how things

1874.71 --> 1880.8600000000001
really work sink in on purpose because

1877.44 --> 1882.059
they can't allow that and as they're

1880.86 --> 1884.61
doing it they're kind of the railing

1882.059 --> 1889.23
things they're just sewing giant

1884.61 --> 1891.2099999999998
confusion making people driving people

1889.23 --> 1895.22
especially young people to make more

1891.21 --> 1895.22
fanatical mistakes

1928.03 --> 1935.5
indeed Robin Stanley but that's because

1931.37 --> 1941.3
classical liberalism was very much

1935.5 --> 1945.05
guided or accompanied grassroots right

1941.3 --> 1949.58
the people do it from a very based

1945.05 --> 1951.8799999999999
Christian perspective from a very logos

1949.58 --> 1955.3999999999999
approach and then yeah it works great

1951.88 --> 1960.23
but if the grassroots if the base that

1955.4 --> 1963.71
go along with it are not not Christian

1960.23 --> 1966.67
or quite the opposite then yeah it

1963.71 --> 1966.67
becomes a monster

1983.88 --> 1992.2800000000002
Oh AGM yeah you got a very good point

1987.66 --> 1995.94
there because the nature of what propels

1992.28 --> 1998.37
liberalism forward bypassing the reality

1995.94 --> 2000.44
is the first step of luciferianism know

1998.37 --> 2004.84
we're better than God getting another

2000.44 --> 2008.15
path right that's the first step the Act

2004.84 --> 2011.33
but it called constantly everyone in it

2008.15 --> 2015.77
seduces you it all drives forward and

2011.33 --> 2018.47
seduction and that so it is yeah it is

2015.77 --> 2023.3799999999999
very Luciferian in nature the essence of

2018.47 --> 2023.38
it Lucifer is strong with that party

2061.67 --> 2066.53
why dude was it though

2072.0 --> 2078.7
yeah well whoever invented feminism if

2075.79 --> 2081.88
they could oversee the consequences of

2078.7 --> 2084.1299999999997
what it would turn into the only reason

2081.88 --> 2086.35
for them to do it would be sheer hatred

2084.13 --> 2090.19
but on the other hand of hatred for

2086.35 --> 2093.22
women you know but on the other hand I

2090.19 --> 2097.36
don't know who exactly invented it and I

2093.22 --> 2099.7799999999997
don't know if he was aware on the long

2097.36 --> 2102.8700000000003
run of what what was gonna happen I

2099.78 --> 2102.8700000000003
don't know

2117.54 --> 2120.61
[Music]

2125.58 --> 2128.33
all right

2135.45 --> 2140.48
but you know as a such social

2137.94 --> 2144.569
engineering construct Robin Stanley

2140.48 --> 2148.4
feminism it's kind of harsh to a lot of

2144.569 --> 2153.089
people probably but it is probably a

2148.4 --> 2159.9
construct to turn regular based society

2153.089 --> 2163.109
into slaves by separating families yeah

2159.9 --> 2165.27
halting their prosperity and growth and

2163.109 --> 2168.68
then turning them all separately into

2165.27 --> 2172.4
work slaves so yeah

2168.68 --> 2175.3799999999997
instead of having half the families work

2172.4 --> 2178.339
they have the entire family work and

2175.38 --> 2184.549
they extract much more so it is kind of

2178.339 --> 2184.549
in the interest of cold corporatism

2188.9 --> 2199.2690000000002
where it isn't it that feminism in their

2194.749 --> 2204.95
long run really is like hardcore

2199.269 --> 2207.68
capitalist oligarchy style cuz yeah the

2204.95 --> 2209.5989999999997
oligarchs who don't give a [ __ ] they're

2207.68 --> 2212.749
like yeah I we just want to get more

2209.599 --> 2215.779
money from them we want them to work

2212.749 --> 2218.269
harder so yeah feminism great now

2215.779 --> 2230.41
suddenly everybody becomes workers we

2218.269 --> 2230.41
can give a [ __ ] about their future yeah

2237.5 --> 2240.65
all right

2269.86 --> 2273.84
was it what Cleary

2280.579 --> 2286.819
well in a way you could say that

2283.929 --> 2290.029
feminism was utilized by the state

2286.819 --> 2293.8089999999997
during World War two while the men were

2290.029 --> 2295.609
sent out to war and all the females were

2293.809 --> 2298.549
working in the a munitions factory it's

2295.609 --> 2300.589
like even the for wedding history they

2298.549 --> 2303.349
put in now so this it's like oh look

2300.589 --> 2307.189
this is the advantage of it we got more

2303.349 --> 2309.589
because they see that's already giving a

2307.189 --> 2310.339
suggestion like yeah with feminism you

2309.589 --> 2312.5589999999997
can win

2310.339 --> 2318.229
that's that message that comes from that

2312.559 --> 2320.719
do you understand it probably did help

2318.229 --> 2321.5589999999997
him a lot but hey during war times it's

2320.719 --> 2323.959
kind of different

2321.559 --> 2328.1600000000003
and the United States is not the only

2323.959 --> 2330.499
country that did that like when there's

2328.16 --> 2334.5389999999998
real war things get really serious and

2330.499 --> 2339.819
then everybody that can must contribute

2334.539 --> 2339.8190000000004
that's how that worked then

2345.34 --> 2350.9500000000003
but in times when there is when when

2348.49 --> 2351.64
they're in peace times there's really no

2350.95 --> 2357.27
use for it

2351.64 --> 2357.27
it'll just destabilize

2364.65 --> 2368.58
All Right see you later idea

2386.26 --> 2393.55
all right yeah Robin Stanley I saw many

2389.8 --> 2398.59
families turn a tear apart by feminism

2393.55 --> 2401.6800000000003
as well my own included my mother became

2398.59 --> 2403.619
a feminist as she was into that already

2401.68 --> 2407.2599999999998
very young but she also got

2403.619 --> 2409.54
mind-controlled by news and [ __ ] to push

2407.26 --> 2418.3
it further into the insanity level and

2409.54 --> 2420.49
she had issues with that and in a way

2418.3 --> 2423.13
this is all our own fault there was our

2420.49 --> 2426.54
family choices fault because we became a

2423.13 --> 2431.85
typical television watching Dutch

2426.54 --> 2435.46
liberal family and I was very

2431.85 --> 2439.859
influential and my mother despite her

2435.46 --> 2444.52
age was also incredibly influenceable I

2439.859 --> 2446.44
think that my dad was probably the least

2444.52 --> 2448.9
influenced about what he was it was kind

2446.44 --> 2453.94
of it wasn't really a TV watcher guy he

2448.9 --> 2457.06
would like like often be on his own

2453.94 --> 2459.119
which was not morally good either by the

2457.06 --> 2459.119
way

2460.74 --> 2466.56
but yeah my dad and my mom had a lot of

2463.93 --> 2471.609
fights that's a after a certain point

2466.56 --> 2474.52
after my teens and that is what that was

2471.609 --> 2476.44
and it doesn't help when your parents

2474.52 --> 2478.78
have fights and your mom is basically

2476.44 --> 2481.57
then letting herself get indoctrinated

2478.78 --> 2483.73
by the television just get rid of the

2481.57 --> 2486.6400000000003
man it's all worthless and yeah that

2483.73 --> 2489.07
doesn't help demand family relation

2486.64 --> 2491.91
problems between the parents it was

2489.07 --> 2491.9100000000003
terrible influence

2507.28 --> 2513.7400000000002
well bumbaclot gator fish I didn't

2510.5 --> 2515.869
understand the impact of it all really I

2513.74 --> 2518.39
just thought that my mother was being

2515.869 --> 2523.2200000000003
misled and at some point I really did

2518.39 --> 2525.589
try to get her and my dad together like

2523.22 --> 2529.0
on a certain holiday it was probably the

2525.589 --> 2534.5299999999997
last holiday we had together as a family

2529.0 --> 2536.96
and they were just constantly squabbling

2534.53 --> 2538.849
over nonsense and avoiding getting into

2536.96 --> 2540.65
a real conversation but still sticking

2538.849 --> 2543.319
together and that was kind of like going

2540.65 --> 2547.15
on for a long time so I tried to force

2543.319 --> 2549.8
the issue taking on all the the typical

2547.15 --> 2552.56
side effects of the liberal backlash

2549.8 --> 2556.579
from my mom who would go like a baller

2552.56 --> 2559.25
yeah yeah like ballers do like that way

2556.579 --> 2563.9300000000003
go completely cognitive dissonance and

2559.25 --> 2565.94
contradict herself from mega stress not

2563.93 --> 2568.79
being able to handle the situation of

2565.94 --> 2572.359
being able to handle this big relation

2568.79 --> 2574.7
problem and I kind of like took that

2572.359 --> 2577.31
heat because my dad couldn't he couldn't

2574.7 --> 2579.89
handle that at all not a drop of it that

2577.31 --> 2585.44
was part of the problem so I took that

2579.89 --> 2587.3489999999997
on and in the discussion it was 15 okay

2585.44 --> 2589.55
it's crazy but I could do it I

2587.349 --> 2593.42
understood a lot about the interaction

2589.55 --> 2595.04
between squabbling and arguing parents

2593.42 --> 2597.98
because I was there it was happening a

2595.04 --> 2599.63
lot I was studying my parents and I was

2597.98 --> 2603.29
trying to compare it with other people

2599.63 --> 2605.69
so I tried it it kind of worked they got

2603.29 --> 2608.81
a better understanding like I got them

2605.69 --> 2612.68
to spiritually connect again but as a

2608.81 --> 2616.16
result of that they also concluded that

2612.68 --> 2618.23
it was never gonna men again yeah that

2616.16 --> 2620.319
really sucks because I was actually

2618.23 --> 2623.81
trying to really men it again but I

2620.319 --> 2625.73
instead called that it cost them to

2623.81 --> 2629.63
realize that they couldn't do that so

2625.73 --> 2632.9
after that they really started to get

2629.63 --> 2635.48
divorced didn't feel really great about

2632.9 --> 2637.67
that if you know what I mean made me

2635.48 --> 2641.7
feel like I was a giant

2637.67 --> 2643.94
but I just didn't get what happened back

2641.7 --> 2643.9399999999996
then

2689.539 --> 2695.469
oh wow Robin sadly yeah

2701.33 --> 2707.36
well it's very valuable that you chose

2704.57 --> 2709.34
to do that because I don't know this

2707.36 --> 2711.3700000000003
it's something Owen Benjamin kind of

2709.34 --> 2716.63
says and I really believe it too is that

2711.37 --> 2718.0099999999998
you know you can apply all that smarts

2716.63 --> 2723.08
all that inside all the knowledge you

2718.01 --> 2726.7900000000004
gather even so well to to educate your

2723.08 --> 2730.0099999999998
kids on a very fine-tuned level that

2726.79 --> 2734.57
society and other teachers never can

2730.01 --> 2738.01
achieve it's super valuable especially

2734.57 --> 2742.0
if you have had studies and know a lot

2738.01 --> 2749.92
like if I ever have a family I want my

2742.0 --> 2753.32
my wife to be very smart and to realize

2749.92 --> 2762.2200000000003
that that doesn't force her to be a

2753.32 --> 2765.2200000000003
career girl or something low ranty

2762.22 --> 2765.22
morning

2766.35 --> 2769.5099999999998
[Music]

2772.579 --> 2776.1800000000003
right more colored

2813.56 --> 2821.65
oh I bet it was Robin Stanley yeah but

2817.37 --> 2821.65
getting kids is a giant life change

2845.78 --> 2853.55
Oh God oh yeah Robin Stanley I approve

2849.94 --> 2855.4700000000003
well that I can imagine that's very

2853.55 --> 2858.2000000000003
tough because yeah if you got a lot of

2855.47 --> 2861.35
career women in your family they're all

2858.2 --> 2864.47
gonna be poking and trying to be better

2861.35 --> 2867.95
and they're gonna scoff at you for not

2864.47 --> 2869.8999999999996
going with that then probably not saying

2867.95 --> 2871.6099999999997
they as individuals would but that would

2869.9 --> 2873.53
be typically the atmosphere that it

2871.61 --> 2878.44
would arise if you're all together and

2873.53 --> 2878.44
such I think

2896.869 --> 2900.219
oh that's really nice

2920.38 --> 2923.009
yeah

2934.41 --> 2939.2
wow that's really awesome Robin Stanley

2936.63 --> 2939.2000000000003
good to hear

2971.39 --> 2976.67
hmm yeah does studio 60 I think I

2974.63 --> 2978.37
remember that it was pretty bad wasn't

2976.67 --> 2980.42
it

2978.37 --> 2982.49
what's that on the flat earth today I

2980.42 --> 2986.39
remember one time when she like really

2982.49 --> 2991.3399999999997
got totally maniacally angry was

2986.39 --> 2993.71
overkill no wasn't that it was like half

2991.34 --> 2995.6600000000003
a year ago or something I don't know

2993.71 --> 2998.11
maybe that was against right to hand I

2995.66 --> 2998.1099999999997
don't know

3006.77 --> 3019.93
well wasn't rent ease all right yeah

3014.859 --> 3022.93
yeah I watch part of them it was just

3019.93 --> 3022.93
yeah

3055.89 --> 3064.279
I know I seem to be somewhat shy for

3060.299 --> 3064.279
subjects to talk about at the moment

3089.799 --> 3096.92
right at you you're saying that your mom

3093.229 --> 3099.16
came out as a flat earther that's that's

3096.92 --> 3099.16
cool

3111.4 --> 3123.46
yeah it's interesting my dad also but I

3117.9 --> 3128.4100000000003
also look I sometimes just drop like my

3123.46 --> 3131.41
most compressed my most intense ideas

3128.41 --> 3132.819
like on him I it's too much for him but

3131.41 --> 3136.96
he's kind of gotten used to it and he

3132.819 --> 3139.119
has paid a lot of attention to also like

3136.96 --> 3142.089
my psychological studies of society and

3139.119 --> 3149.4100000000003
how people respond to this and he's just

3142.089 --> 3152.349
very very aware that uh that there is

3149.41 --> 3156.0989999999997
mind-control going on everywhere so he

3152.349 --> 3159.069
sees that and that people will respond

3156.099 --> 3161.17
to it he seems to be very aware of this

3159.069 --> 3163.749
it's like almost beyond just flattered

3161.17 --> 3166.2400000000002
so it's not like somebody that really

3163.749 --> 3167.89
wants to talk about Flat Earth but he

3166.24 --> 3170.9399999999996
totally understands and also the

3167.89 --> 3170.94
psychological consequences

3178.28 --> 3184.6800000000003
huh your mama raised you as a flat

3181.56 --> 3186.98
earther Wow Amanda young that's that's

3184.68 --> 3186.98
interesting

3194.16 --> 3201.44
well on the other hand my mother may

3196.349 --> 3201.44
have tried to do that as well but yeah

3207.71 --> 3215.21
then I fell in love with outer space and

3212.18 --> 3219.46
sci-fi so I didn't really work out that

3215.21 --> 3219.46
well after my teens

3223.94 --> 3228.65
like I wonder sometimes what would have

3226.28 --> 3231.3190000000004
happened with my life if I'd never been

3228.65 --> 3237.049
introduced with computers if I'd like

3231.319 --> 3240.77
lived on a well on a farm maybe where

3237.049 --> 3243.5
there was always something to do and you

3240.77 --> 3247.13
wouldn't be subjected to TV as much and

3243.5 --> 3253.329
computers and I wonder if I've I would

3247.13 --> 3253.329
have gone the same route spiritually

3253.839 --> 3262.599
because if you don't see the option

3256.76 --> 3262.599
early on you're not gonna choose them so

3271.299 --> 3281.049
all right well Robin Stanley I wasn't

3273.849 --> 3283.4190000000003
raised as a Christian but not it yet not

3281.049 --> 3287.829
in the classical but I was kind of

3283.419 --> 3290.499
raised with or asked about it like

3287.829 --> 3293.739
everybody was trying to develop their

3290.499 --> 3298.419
spiritual ideas in their own way in the

3293.739 --> 3299.679
family and very early on I was just very

3298.419 --> 3301.419
strong with God

3299.679 --> 3303.579
like I didn't even know the freaking

3301.419 --> 3306.3089999999997
Bible I just freaking felt God

3303.579 --> 3314.4590000000003
everywhere like all the time

3306.309 --> 3314.4590000000003
this is that's how it started out and I

3316.559 --> 3321.219
always knew like I want to be good and I

3319.329 --> 3325.599
want to figure out what good really is

3321.219 --> 3327.549
and I want to do things right but then

3325.599 --> 3332.7690000000002
eventually yeah I got seduced and

3327.549 --> 3335.949
mislead it into yeah they're railing

3332.769 --> 3338.9489999999996
what right really is and then trying to

3335.949 --> 3345.4590000000003
figure out why and yeah getting all

3338.949 --> 3347.919
liberal and complicated deviating and I

3345.459 --> 3350.469
really never knew what hit me when all

3347.919 --> 3352.769
of that happened I really didn't didn't

3350.469 --> 3352.7690000000002
see it

3357.7 --> 3364.3489999999997
right

3359.7 --> 3367.5589999999997
and when I started to see it I still had

3364.349 --> 3369.869
that flame with me that I originally saw

3367.559 --> 3373.77
as God being everywhere but I kept it to

3369.869 --> 3375.96
me as in like okay as long as I don't

3373.77 --> 3378.42
let go of that whatever happens out

3375.96 --> 3384.059
there it's like everything that I did

3378.42 --> 3387.14
was all in a way presupposed it's a

3384.059 --> 3389.7900000000004
presupposing so far that you lose track

3387.14 --> 3393.8689999999997
then this kind of in a way almost what

3389.79 --> 3397.46
liberalism is by passing through endless

3393.869 --> 3397.46
preset presuppositions

3429.519 --> 3432.2389999999996
hmm

3438.12 --> 3444.02
right Brennan cook well that is kind of

3440.49 --> 3447.8999999999996
the approach that my parents did as well

3444.02 --> 3451.38
and as a very young kid that was good

3447.9 --> 3453.39
like but till I was eight that worked

3451.38 --> 3455.33
fantastically I was always doing

3453.39 --> 3458.43
something always developing something

3455.33 --> 3460.98
but after that I should have probably

3458.43 --> 3464.79
got a lot more structure and my parents

3460.98 --> 3468.8
also kind of knew it but it probably

3464.79 --> 3472.35
wasn't enough I needed somebody to

3468.8 --> 3476.3700000000003
direct where I was going because I just

3472.35 --> 3478.17
had no idea I could always build on

3476.37 --> 3483.71
things that I was dealing with but I

3478.17 --> 3491.04
didn't know how to go out in society and

3483.71 --> 3493.41
I really missed yeah missed the guidance

3491.04 --> 3495.5099999999998
in that but maybe in another way like my

3493.41 --> 3502.17
parents weren't that great at it either

3495.51 --> 3506.7000000000003
and they had probably been yeah not very

3502.17 --> 3509.25
well structured into what they how they

3506.7 --> 3512.16
did things and they just stuck to

3509.25 --> 3513.72
something they loved like to music and I

3512.16 --> 3516.5099999999998
went with that and tried to find

3513.72 --> 3520.5299999999997
professional approaches with that and

3516.51 --> 3523.0200000000004
they did that and they kind of tried to

3520.53 --> 3525.03
they hoped for me that I could do the

3523.02 --> 3527.22
same thing but I just couldn't figure it

3525.03 --> 3529.8
out what I would do it's like none of it

3527.22 --> 3532.6699999999996
made any sense and I even already

3529.8 --> 3532.67
noticed that

3535.74 --> 3543.81
yeah no thing that I could think of

3538.44 --> 3546.93
would have truly fit me it's kind of way

3543.81 --> 3550.67
because almost well being on YouTube

3546.93 --> 3553.44
doing my thing here talking trying to

3550.67 --> 3558.06
get as much wisdom out in the open as I

3553.44 --> 3561.0
can it almost seems like this is this is

3558.06 --> 3562.68
much more suitable for me that's why I

3561.0 --> 3565.38
keep on doing it every day even though I

3562.68 --> 3567.27
barely get anything out of it

3565.38 --> 3572.6400000000003
practically compared to some other

3567.27 --> 3579.27
career but I get a lot more energy out

3572.64 --> 3581.97
of it and yeah and I got to know so many

3579.27 --> 3584.7
people and it is a great way for me to

3581.97 --> 3588.7799999999997
have gotten no no to get to know all

3584.7 --> 3590.97
these people because in other ways I'm

3588.78 --> 3593.869
really not that good and getting to know

3590.97 --> 3593.8689999999997
a lot of people

3599.57 --> 3604.55
like I've had a lot of trouble overall

3602.66 --> 3606.95
another every time you know it really

3604.55 --> 3609.4700000000003
depends but overall on average I have a

3606.95 --> 3612.29
lot of trouble representing myself face

3609.47 --> 3616.4199999999996
to face because I don't really know what

3612.29 --> 3616.42
type of attitude I should be taking

3623.7 --> 3628.49
yeah anyway

3638.39 --> 3647.8089999999997
yeah it's good good to hear yeah it's is

3643.77 --> 3650.4
great that everyone really feels like

3647.809 --> 3652.8590000000004
sharing all these things it's really

3650.4 --> 3659.579
good to hear all the similarities and

3652.859 --> 3663.0
also the unique experiences yeah I

3659.579 --> 3665.2200000000003
really appreciate it where we all learn

3663.0 --> 3667.43
a lot from sharing these things with one

3665.22 --> 3667.43
another

3684.339 --> 3693.42
uh no no lies exposed no

3696.0 --> 3699.8
no sorry I can't

3710.079 --> 3714.319
if you really think you got some kind of

3712.549 --> 3716.479
case then make a video about it but I

3714.319 --> 3725.42
will not have you slander people that I

3716.479 --> 3730.339
trust in my chat and hey again for

3725.42 --> 3734.989
anyone don't let somebody be your

3730.339 --> 3738.259
absolute by by voluntary choice dictator

3734.989 --> 3741.259
of information in some regard don't

3738.259 --> 3743.9
blindly take on literally everything

3741.259 --> 3750.049
somebody says as a specialist never do

3743.9 --> 3753.619
that never okay paula is still a person

3750.049 --> 3757.279
but she has studied so much she has her

3753.619 --> 3760.6600000000003
own opinions and kind of feminist angles

3757.279 --> 3765.079
to things for herself right she tries to

3760.66 --> 3767.269
keep that out as much as he can but

3765.079 --> 3770.989
sometimes it comes back a little so yeah

3767.269 --> 3776.6299999999997
she's not a perfect person but she is

3770.989 --> 3777.829
not absolutely not a Bible denier false

3776.63 --> 3780.7690000000002
teacher that is just absolutely

3777.829 --> 3782.9790000000003
ridiculous to say that again you're

3780.769 --> 3782.979
banned

3801.64 --> 3809.3599999999997
yeah Paula is ace indeed and I think

3806.03 --> 3814.13
that she's doing fantastic she's doing a

3809.36 --> 3816.7400000000002
lot better overall in the quality of her

3814.13 --> 3818.33
output and as a person also I think

3816.74 --> 3824.18
she's just doing a lot better than she

3818.33 --> 3825.7999999999997
was a few years ago yeah you're pushing

3824.18 --> 3830.6299999999997
it Amanda young I knew you were gonna do

3825.8 --> 3839.3500000000004
that but thank you for the superjet

3830.63 --> 3842.96
donation let's see how far this goes I

3839.35 --> 3846.25
kind of wanted to get lunch don't really

3842.96 --> 3846.25
feel like getting another banana

3857.39 --> 3860.95
yeah man youngjae's

3883.5 --> 3888.05
bass fishing huh

3901.1 --> 3904.48
Oh dad studio

3906.65 --> 3910.7490000000003
I've had those issues a lot as well

3914.69 --> 3920.03
well you guys have noticed that and of

3917.06 --> 3921.59
course because sometimes they just

3920.03 --> 3924.6200000000003
really feel really shitty and then I

3921.59 --> 3930.83
explained exactly why I'm being haunted

3924.62 --> 3936.91
by some kind of fear or guilt that's

3930.83 --> 3936.91
been somewhat over amplified from within

3938.35 --> 3946.7599999999998
and as for yeah the forgiveness part in

3942.83 --> 3949.16
Jesus like every time and like help-help

3946.76 --> 3951.7700000000004
me please forgive me and it's like yeah

3949.16 --> 3957.2
you're forgiven you just need to get

3951.77 --> 3959.48
over it now it's really tough it's

3957.2 --> 3963.97
really tough sometimes for some people

3959.48 --> 3967.7
and also maybe it should because that

3963.97 --> 3970.97
mechanism and the remembering of that

3967.7 --> 3971.81
will help you not make a bad decision

3970.97 --> 3977.27
again

3971.81 --> 3979.46
that's what conscious does but as for

3977.27 --> 3983.42
the forgiving the ethereal the spiritual

3979.46 --> 3987.4700000000003
part that is not so hard it's really

3983.42 --> 3993.71
about just doing things right stepping

3987.47 --> 3995.81
away from the sin but once you have

3993.71 --> 3997.82
stepped away from the sin yeah you can

3995.81 --> 4000.07
still feel incredibly guilty about it

3997.82 --> 4004.0
it's you could almost say it's like a

4000.07 --> 4006.3700000000003
grieving process but you if you stay on

4004.0 --> 4008.68
guilty feeling guilty about it forever

4006.37 --> 4010.75
then it's more like a curse and I don't

4008.68 --> 4012.8999999999996
know if Jesus could do anything about

4010.75 --> 4012.9
that

4013.08 --> 4016.27
[Music]

4021.74 --> 4027.08
it's just the promise if you just stop

4024.23 --> 4030.95
sitting if you just do your best to get

4027.08 --> 4033.08
right don't don't falter try not to

4030.95 --> 4035.45
falter and if you do then get back up

4033.08 --> 4037.79
again and go and make sure that that is

4035.45 --> 4040.8489999999997
the the right direction is the way you

4037.79 --> 4041.9
want to go that is what you pursue and

4040.849 --> 4045.2000000000003
you can make mistakes

4041.9 --> 4048.92
no devil tricks you a lot fall backs all

4045.2 --> 4052.25
that [ __ ] as long as you really intend

4048.92 --> 4058.46
to go there and put effort in it to make

4052.25 --> 4060.5
it real then yeah you're following the

4058.46 --> 4063.349
path you're trying you're doing your

4060.5 --> 4066.98
bastard yeah and that's really what it's

4063.349 --> 4069.369
about the most and the understanding of

4066.98 --> 4069.369
Jesus

4076.46 --> 4086.44
but yeah the guilt is separate it's like

4081.97 --> 4092.5099999999998
you could say guilt is also can be a

4086.44 --> 4098.33
Romanian punishment it's like pulls you

4092.51 --> 4101.83
down it weakens you but it was designed

4098.33 --> 4104.18
to do that that was the mechanism

4101.83 --> 4106.61
separated from Christ it's like the

4104.18 --> 4111.530000000001
inner mechanism that prevents people

4106.61 --> 4115.639999999999
from just rapidly catalyzing going into

4111.53 --> 4118.759999999999
Cataclysm with derailed insane social

4115.64 --> 4121.01
behavior that's the mechanism to stop

4118.76 --> 4125.47
that naturally without being informed

4121.01 --> 4130.55
about Christ but it will keep on going

4125.47 --> 4132.530000000001
if you have dwelt and sinned badly even

4130.55 --> 4136.25
if you didn't realize that it was that

4132.53 --> 4138.62
or not consciously maybe you felt

4136.25 --> 4140.96
something but you'd misinterpreted

4138.62 --> 4144.38
already ignored it yeah did you

4140.96 --> 4147.32
consciousness your guilts your fears are

4144.38 --> 4151.46
gonna punish you for that afterward once

4147.32 --> 4154.57
it gets through to you and that's

4151.46 --> 4154.57
separate from Christ

4157.779 --> 4165.790000000001
but you can let it direct you towards

4161.23 --> 4170.259
Christ but that doesn't mean that it's

4165.79 --> 4174.1
gonna be over after that just means that

4170.259 --> 4179.5
you can start to take care of it to

4174.1 --> 4182.9400000000005
grieve for the sin of your past it kind

4179.5 --> 4182.94
of is how it feels to me

4186.84 --> 4189.959
[Music]

4210.08 --> 4212.83
hmm

4245.209 --> 4247.869
hmm

4262.3 --> 4269.05
Wow oh my god that's so awesome you're

4267.13 --> 4273.3
actually making little shoes for your

4269.05 --> 4273.3
own kid that is so cool

4306.26 --> 4309.97
a mesh Amish life

4314.8 --> 4324.39
if you can it's awesome the more you can

4319.39 --> 4327.52
make yourself from scratch the better

4324.39 --> 4329.68
because yeah society breaks down

4327.52 --> 4333.370000000001
everybody goes nuts start eating one

4329.68 --> 4335.83
another you're probably just like we'll

4333.37 --> 4338.94
just move a little further down the

4335.83 --> 4344.08
mountains and stay there for a while and

4338.94 --> 4346.2699999999995
keep on doing what we do yeah that's the

4344.08 --> 4349.05
advantage of that if you can really make

4346.27 --> 4349.05
your own stuff

4364.179 --> 4371.53
hmm well Ryan eartha that yeah

4367.83 --> 4374.199
primitives uh I really respect that but

4371.53 --> 4376.509999999999
for me I'm still yeah i'm unfortunately

4374.199 --> 4379.78
i grew up in the netherlands so i'm

4376.51 --> 4382.2390000000005
really just a metropolitan guy well I

4379.78 --> 4384.5199999999995
don't like it it's just that everywhere

4382.239 --> 4388.69
in the Netherlands is either big city or

4384.52 --> 4391.570000000001
suburb there's no barely yeah any wild

4388.69 --> 4394.21
country it's just forests and then it's

4391.57 --> 4399.37
designated for walking so there's really

4394.21 --> 4402.46
no wild thing left actually but I really

4399.37 --> 4404.679
respect that quality of just making your

4402.46 --> 4407.55
own thing so I'm more and more really

4404.679 --> 4412.57
trying to direct myself as to yeah

4407.55 --> 4415.87
repair your own clothing just knit the

4412.57 --> 4419.23
holes tight fixed gloves and it is so

4415.87 --> 4422.0199999999995
much cheaper and hey labor cost for me

4419.23 --> 4424.239
is is free because I got time on my hand

4422.02 --> 4426.85
so I should do it then I'm saving myself

4424.239 --> 4428.889999999999
some money that I don't have to go to a

4426.85 --> 4430.3
shop for somebody else to repair it even

4428.89 --> 4432.55
though they might be professional and

4430.3 --> 4434.469
then of course shoes I don't know how to

4432.55 --> 4440.38
fix my own shoes so I will definitely go

4434.469 --> 4443.409
to a cobbler for that but I respect that

4440.38 --> 4449.5
and in a way it'd be fascinated to try

4443.409 --> 4451.62
and make some of these things from

4449.5 --> 4451.62
scratch

4457.32 --> 4463.08
don't be making your own method that is

4459.45 --> 4469.8
really interesting because for me I'm

4463.08 --> 4473.0599999999995
just very basic really so for show you

4469.8 --> 4475.8
like this cloth like this seam over here

4473.06 --> 4477.780000000001
this just went wide open so it was

4475.8 --> 4479.79
looking ridiculous it wasn't really

4477.78 --> 4483.05
functioning was falling apart and I just

4479.79 --> 4487.83
thought now screw it I'm gonna just

4483.05 --> 4490.22
close it up and it works great now it's

4487.83 --> 4494.1
a little tighter but hey it's not

4490.22 --> 4495.51
totally messed up so yeah and you see it

4494.1 --> 4497.070000000001
like a scar but I don't know it's

4495.51 --> 4500.280000000001
actually kind of charming in a way I

4497.07 --> 4503.389999999999
think it's like proof yeah I fixed this

4500.28 --> 4503.389999999999
I can do that

4510.35 --> 4515.4890000000005
yeah and I don't like throwing away

4512.91 --> 4517.62
things I don't like it at all I'm always

4515.489 --> 4523.11
like no if you're gonna have fabric left

4517.62 --> 4526.8
from some yeah like worn out jacket or

4523.11 --> 4528.299999999999
even shoe I'm like my instinct tells me

4526.8 --> 4533.21
like no I shouldn't throw it away I

4528.3 --> 4537.900000000001
should like take it apart and rebuild it

4533.21 --> 4539.7300000000005
that's that's what I want to to just not

4537.9 --> 4542.78
throw things really because there's some

4539.73 --> 4545.28
hole in it no just really fix it or

4542.78 --> 4547.199
disassemble reassemble with good parts

4545.28 --> 4549.36
and you got something as good as new

4547.199 --> 4556.379999999999
again I wish I could do that with a lot

4549.36 --> 4558.96
of things because I really don't like

4556.38 --> 4563.219
throwing away [ __ ] I hate it

4558.96 --> 4565.86
like I've yeah with food it's inevitable

4563.219 --> 4569.19
but I pay attention like okay as little

4565.86 --> 4571.92
plastic as I can more glass there's

4569.19 --> 4573.9
always gonna be some plastic but there's

4571.92 --> 4575.67
also like alternatives to plastic that

4573.9 --> 4579.36
are starting to get used even in and

4575.67 --> 4581.43
where I go shopping the Eco Plaza and it

4579.36 --> 4584.67
gives me a great comfort because when I

4581.43 --> 4587.52
see a lot of people just getting cheap

4584.67 --> 4589.17
[ __ ] and then throwing the old thing

4587.52 --> 4593.1900000000005
away even though it might still be

4589.17 --> 4596.43
working I'm just like what unless it's

4593.19 --> 4599.549999999999
like archaic you know I wouldn't get

4596.43 --> 4602.06
angry at somebody sir for getting rid of

4599.55 --> 4607.89
their glass TV or something you know

4602.06 --> 4611.64
that's just old junk now but yeah with

4607.89 --> 4614.6990000000005
clothing and and food that you didn't

4611.64 --> 4616.410000000001
finish I don't get why people feel so

4614.699 --> 4620.4
comfortable just throwing it all the way

4616.41 --> 4624.87
I just can't I don't get it on the other

4620.4 --> 4632.299999999999
hand hey I haven't really lived a very

4624.87 --> 4636.179
rich life in the reason the decade so I

4632.3 --> 4638.55
guess that to me I'm just trying to save

4636.179 --> 4640.4800000000005
up as much as possible just to spare

4638.55 --> 4642.71
costs

4640.48 --> 4646.959999999999
but also just instinctively

4642.71 --> 4646.96
I don't like throwing things away

4650.23 --> 4653.459999999999
like in trash

4675.81 --> 4678.160000000001
ooh

4676.3 --> 4681.43
[Music]

4678.16 --> 4684.549
they're weaving loom an actual loom

4681.43 --> 4684.549
[Music]

4688.53 --> 4694.009999999999
from maple huh fascinating stuff

4707.739 --> 4714.129999999999
yeah the old crafts the old crafts are

4711.28 --> 4717.87
extremely valuable because the old

4714.13 --> 4720.1900000000005
crafts came into existence to create

4717.87 --> 4724.84
self-sufficiency in independence and

4720.19 --> 4727.259999999999
that is what rose up the overall output

4724.84 --> 4732.04
and quality of everything and allowed

4727.26 --> 4735.1
industrial society to be sprung forth

4732.04 --> 4738.5199999999995
well that actually probably countered a

4735.1 --> 4742.360000000001
lot of it but the Renaissance like the

4738.52 --> 4745.59
crafts were all at their peaks so well

4742.36 --> 4750.759999999999
developed so long so independent and

4745.59 --> 4752.8
Guilds trade secrets specialist secrets

4750.76 --> 4754.54
that's what comes out of that an

4752.8 --> 4757.06
industrial society where there's just a

4754.54 --> 4762.219
uniform production to make it as cheap

4757.06 --> 4765.13
as possible you lose your specialists

4762.219 --> 4769.54
you lose the ability to start making it

4765.13 --> 4771.46
yourself and then yeah eventually the

4769.54 --> 4775.59
knowledge the deep specialist knowledge

4771.46 --> 4778.03
of such a craft disappears as the old

4775.59 --> 4780.1
generations that had that knowledge no

4778.03 --> 4782.62
longer have anyone to relay it to nobody

4780.1 --> 4785.14
is interested in why did the book start

4782.62 --> 4790.239
to disappear in some drawer somewhere

4785.14 --> 4792.219
and nobody can find it until somebody

4790.239 --> 4798.58
goes really searching and then finds it

4792.219 --> 4802.36
back and they the revival of the of the

4798.58 --> 4805.0
crafts are definitely yeah making that

4802.36 --> 4807.94
happen in ways so a lot of crafts and

4805.0 --> 4810.63
specialized craft tricks are being

4807.94 --> 4810.629999999999
rediscovered

4824.909 --> 4827.539
huh

4832.4 --> 4835.69
hey getting with him

4859.43 --> 4862.06
what

4866.05 --> 4869.26
[Music]

4871.469 --> 4874.61
really Cleary

4875.699 --> 4883.32
it's kind of abrupt thing to say I think

4880.08 --> 4886.98
Joey the already Old Testament God I

4883.32 --> 4892.679
don't think he is Satan I think he may

4886.98 --> 4899.2699999999995
be the unified representation face of

4892.679 --> 4904.01
the of the house of the gods at the time

4899.27 --> 4904.01
it would be the representative

4912.65 --> 4917.8099999999995
and I don't know how that would have

4914.75 --> 4920.57
worked really like there's a lot of

4917.81 --> 4924.59
mystery about the Old Testament for me

4920.57 --> 4928.04
it's like I really wonder sometimes like

4924.59 --> 4933.14
is it always the same it just seems like

4928.04 --> 4935.78
it's it there just seemed these weird

4933.14 --> 4938.12
inconsistencies about the stance and the

4935.78 --> 4940.969999999999
behavior and the responses and I don't

4938.12 --> 4944.18
know I don't know I wouldn't call him

4940.97 --> 4946.93
Satan it's like too pronounced it's too

4944.18 --> 4946.93
specific

4954.519 --> 4958.809
but yeah at this moment I'm entertaining

4956.86 --> 4963.009999999999
that the Old Testament may have actually

4958.809 --> 4966.789
been like a project from the house of

4963.01 --> 4967.7390000000005
gods you know the sons of God where they

4966.789 --> 4970.869
came from

4967.739 --> 4975.039
saying there is not the the whole deal

4970.869 --> 4979.989
the Creator God is there yeah but there

4975.039 --> 4984.489
are others and I think that they may

4979.989 --> 4988.058999999999
have been designated to represent the

4984.489 --> 4991.209999999999
Creator in an indirect way maybe or

4988.059 --> 4995.969
there was a plan to entangle with humans

4991.21 --> 4995.969
do something and I think that may be it

4996.329 --> 5003.119
but to just say he was Satan no that's

4999.61 --> 5004.699
just over generalizing it simply seems

5003.119 --> 5008.489
more complicated than that

5004.699 --> 5011.46
but hey this is just my preliminary like

5008.489 --> 5013.558999999999
I really haven't even read the whole Old

5011.46 --> 5015.15
Testament part I have read big a part

5013.559 --> 5015.92
about it and already got the feel for

5015.15 --> 5022.049999999999
this but

5015.92 --> 5022.05
[Music]

5026.02 --> 5029.849
[Music]

5035.74 --> 5040.67
felting

5038.26 --> 5043.7300000000005
what is that

5040.67 --> 5046.03
that like some kind of basket weaving or

5043.73 --> 5046.03
something

5046.21 --> 5058.39
[Music]

5061.05 --> 5064.169
[Music]

5067.75 --> 5072.389
it

5069.31 --> 5075.63
[Music]

5072.389 --> 5077.909000000001
okay that's funny first thing I'm

5075.63 --> 5080.639
reading about felting in Google is in

5077.909 --> 5083.099999999999
the world of crafting crafting needle

5080.639 --> 5088.1900000000005
felting is one of the cutest activities

5083.1 --> 5088.1900000000005
around okay

5098.899 --> 5105.110000000001
what's that Glary hi this is Bobby

5102.649 --> 5113.059
Collier and I wanted to continue our

5105.11 --> 5117.339999999999
goodness of God teaching sir goody yeah

5113.059 --> 5117.34
sorry I don't need anybody to tell me

5152.35 --> 5159.77
okay lies exposed okay well there's an

5158.15 --> 5163.66
issue with all that and that is I don't

5159.77 --> 5167.120000000001
care I don't care about your freaking

5163.66 --> 5174.08
pronunciation mister Bible Sivan yay get

5167.12 --> 5176.69
out we don't care that you got the right

5174.08 --> 5178.7
magic word and now you've got the keys

5176.69 --> 5182.259999999999
to heaven and everybody else goes to

5178.7 --> 5182.26
hell freakin get out of here

5203.01 --> 5207.780000000001
yeah Bible cellphone yeah you heard me

5251.869 --> 5261.82
okay the studio 68 yeah

5261.92 --> 5266.81
yeah Bible sophronia would technically

5264.5 --> 5269.63
be just like a regular savonia but they

5266.81 --> 5271.1
would say you didn't get it right you're

5269.63 --> 5273.83
doing it wrong you're saying Jesus

5271.1 --> 5278.450000000001
Christ it's wrong you're going to hell

5273.83 --> 5281.0
because you didn't understand so you

5278.45 --> 5283.07
need to do it exactly like I say listen

5281.0 --> 5286.16
to this listen to that let yourself be

5283.07 --> 5289.78
indoctrinated to be extremely fanatical

5286.16 --> 5294.38
and polarized about this detail thing

5289.78 --> 5296.09
that they think is so important and then

5294.38 --> 5298.1
you become a crazy

5296.09 --> 5300.53
Savannah fanatic and start to bother

5298.1 --> 5304.570000000001
everyone with that [ __ ] it's not helping

5300.53 --> 5304.57
anyone especially themselves

5319.07 --> 5324.3099999999995
oh yeah well said rikiya life totally

5322.04 --> 5324.31
agree

5352.78 --> 5359.38
God made Satan good and evil your choice

5356.32 --> 5362.0199999999995
I wish you used commas in that sentence

5359.38 --> 5363.88
that would clear some misunderstandings

5362.02 --> 5368.26
upward key alive but I think I get what

5363.88 --> 5371.02
you were saying I want to put a comma

5368.26 --> 5373.39
between the Satan and the good and evil

5371.02 --> 5379.120000000001
because now you can interpret that as if

5373.39 --> 5381.43
he got made Satan good or evil and it's

5379.12 --> 5386.74
your choice that's I don't think that's

5381.43 --> 5389.77
how it works but on the other hand maybe

5386.74 --> 5393.49
yeah the the weird suspense of disbelief

5389.77 --> 5398.1900000000005
trancing could be considered that in

5393.49 --> 5398.19
that reversed world hypnotize

5398.94 --> 5406.089999999999
one would there see Satan as good it

5403.03 --> 5408.429999999999
would be the what drives you what seems

5406.09 --> 5411.16
good and in that sense maybe it is

5408.43 --> 5416.68
literal maybe God allowed that weird

5411.16 --> 5420.639999999999
satanic opposition trance to be viable

5416.68 --> 5423.150000000001
among humans is that what you were

5420.64 --> 5423.150000000001
trying to say

5469.139 --> 5478.86
what what center of what language of the

5474.69 --> 5481.219
other edge no people why are you talking

5478.86 --> 5481.219
about

5493.35 --> 5497.93
what does that mean Reiner certain

5513.63 --> 5521.46
hmm seeking star water that is a that's

5517.599 --> 5524.139
a bit of a heavy statement to make I'm

5521.46 --> 5529.269
wouldn't put it that far personally but

5524.139 --> 5533.13
yet Jesuits have definitely rearranged

5529.269 --> 5537.6990000000005
certain things maybe but I think that

5533.13 --> 5540.82
they probably inserted inserted just a

5537.699 --> 5542.768999999999
couple of elements somewhere to a

5540.82 --> 5545.92
certain degree where it was allowed and

5542.769 --> 5547.619000000001
outside of it a lot more of that but I

5545.92 --> 5551.71
think that there are most critical

5547.619 --> 5556.889
influences it's not so not not so much

5551.71 --> 5561.099
inserting as leaving out erasing key

5556.889 --> 5567.429
words or read ascribing them I think

5561.099 --> 5570.519
that is the biggest issue the things

5567.429 --> 5573.76
that were left out like what I

5570.519 --> 5577.2390000000005
immediately bumped into and then the

5573.76 --> 5580.269
sons of God did all this and like Oh

5577.239 --> 5582.28
what really the sons of God like a hug

5580.269 --> 5586.21
there so there's gods there's more gods

5582.28 --> 5590.559
what where is all that it's not in there

5586.21 --> 5593.76
so yeah stuff is being left out and it's

5590.559 --> 5593.76
not the only thing it's

5597.04 --> 5600.199
[Music]

5612.809 --> 5619.92
hmm yeah goat servant well I am starting

5615.599 --> 5622.619000000001
to read the the Bible now from where

5619.92 --> 5624.42
Jesus comes into play as it were so I'm

5622.619 --> 5628.11
reading the New Testament now first

5624.42 --> 5635.639
because it was getting kind of weary the

5628.11 --> 5637.829
Old Testament for a while then I was

5635.639 --> 5641.28
advised to do that also by my healer and

5637.829 --> 5644.25
I am gonna read it I'll probably see if

5641.28 --> 5648.599
I can finish reading most of it before

5644.25 --> 5651.53
Christmas that should be properly as

5648.599 --> 5651.53
proper timing

5660.469 --> 5666.9800000000005
hm it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

5664.28 --> 5670.239
if they are gods if there are sons of

5666.98 --> 5673.759999999999
gods that implies something big okay

5670.239 --> 5678.468999999999
humans are not sons of God they were

5673.76 --> 5681.110000000001
created right so sons means a part of

5678.469 --> 5685.969
them that makes them maybe they're my

5681.11 --> 5689.21
gods whatever they are there are sons of

5685.969 --> 5692.0
God and what that implies is massive and

5689.21 --> 5696.41
it's just one freaking sentence in the

5692.0 --> 5698.62
Bible okay one freaking sentence says so

5696.41 --> 5698.62
much

5707.179 --> 5712.46
right mark colored well for me it is

5709.37 --> 5715.489
like immediately just tells me like oh

5712.46 --> 5718.78
oh right so Mount Olympus the Greek

5715.489 --> 5722.0
pantheon whatever the a Pantheon and

5718.78 --> 5726.139999999999
that's per that was there maybe still is

5722.0 --> 5730.73
I don't know how it works but it seems

5726.14 --> 5734.87
like the Creator is not singular in

5730.73 --> 5740.48
where what yeah and how it really works

5734.87 --> 5743.449
it it's yeah there's others and they are

5740.48 --> 5747.889999999999
not capable of enthroning him even

5743.449 --> 5750.0199999999995
though they probably think so I'm just

5747.89 --> 5761.030000000001
saying there's other similar similar

5750.02 --> 5764.09
beings maybe or there were I as I said

5761.03 --> 5768.889999999999
so much is left out it's just that

5764.09 --> 5772.42
really got my imagination associations

5768.89 --> 5772.42
going big time when it saw that

5775.809 --> 5781.929
yeah oh really could you cut that from

5779.199 --> 5786.21
the Bible a gem or did you just pull

5781.929 --> 5786.21
that out of a dark hole

5798.22 --> 5801.589
[Music]

5808.82 --> 5812.37
[Music]

5815.88 --> 5829.79
I haven't seen any direct evidence if

5820.11 --> 5829.79
you only read my god AGM seriously

5830.03 --> 5840.179999999999
please check your attitude yeah look the

5837.45 --> 5842.49
way you're describing it sons of God is

5840.18 --> 5845.280000000001
a title yeah

5842.49 --> 5848.34
there's no indication of a title or a

5845.28 --> 5850.86
hierarchy or what were they right so all

5848.34 --> 5859.35
you got to go with is the words that

5850.86 --> 5866.37
were used sons multiple a son a child

5859.35 --> 5868.83
off offspring right so there's no

5866.37 --> 5871.2
indication that it is a title and that

5868.83 --> 5874.1
that title would change ever

5871.2 --> 5879.3
and what they would be declared

5874.1 --> 5884.04
afterward that's not directly relevant

5879.3 --> 5886.02
it's a what they were what they are you

5884.04 --> 5888.57
could call them fallen angels but were

5886.02 --> 5891.81
they fallen angels were they angels were

5888.57 --> 5899.58
they servants or were they offsprings

5891.81 --> 5902.72
were they sons okay unless you want to

5899.58 --> 5907.17
suggest that angels are sons of God too

5902.72 --> 5911.22
that he you know procreated them into

5907.17 --> 5915.78
existence I don't think so no no I'm

5911.22 --> 5921.21
gonna stick to the word the word sons

5915.78 --> 5924.179999999999
right and I'm not gonna come vini n't

5921.21 --> 5926.49
lis try to maneuver it into some meaning

5924.18 --> 5928.650000000001
something else because then what you

5926.49 --> 5932.45
believe it makes more sense no no no I'm

5928.65 --> 5932.45
gonna stick it to the word

5952.57 --> 5957.7
hey Jim you're starting to seriously

5955.06 --> 5961.47
piss me off here seriously piss me off

5957.7 --> 5961.47
because Europe you're pushing it you

5963.54 --> 5970.84
keep it on pushing it and you're not

5966.73 --> 5972.219999999999
responding to the actual words and all

5970.84 --> 5975.85
the other things you're dragging in

5972.22 --> 5979.72
there and all your books I'm going by

5975.85 --> 5981.34
the Bible not 80 bucks the Bible do you

5979.72 --> 5990.45
do you want me to look it up for you

5981.34 --> 5990.45
again show you yeah

6020.02 --> 6027.700000000001
all right yeah I am I'm telling you

6023.35 --> 6029.71
hm what you're spitting in there is

6027.7 --> 6031.66
you're taking away the word you're

6029.71 --> 6035.32
saying no that that word doesn't mean

6031.66 --> 6040.0
what that word means and I am very

6035.32 --> 6044.219999999999
offended by that that you allow yourself

6040.0 --> 6044.22
in the face of me to do that

6058.59 --> 6061.72
[Music]

6095.239 --> 6103.639999999999
you're terrible a gem you just said you

6100.79 --> 6106.04
were gonna quote something from the

6103.64 --> 6107.75
Bible and then you've talked about the

6106.04 --> 6110.38
scores with the football that's just

6107.75 --> 6110.38
brilliant man

6143.199 --> 6147.969
right yeah well Robin Stanley it's yeah

6146.53 --> 6150.219
I'm gonna round out the show not too

6147.969 --> 6154.36
long from now but I like that point what

6150.219 --> 6157.21
you said it's a classic saying it's

6154.36 --> 6162.25
something that has probably occurred on

6157.21 --> 6168.85
for centuries the saying God believes in

6162.25 --> 6170.679
you but what does that even mean does

6168.85 --> 6173.89
that mean he believes you are real and

6170.679 --> 6176.35
not his fantasy or does it imply

6173.89 --> 6179.17
something more mysterious that is kind

6176.35 --> 6183.219
of echoed on while the original source

6179.17 --> 6186.37
of why that means something has gone

6183.219 --> 6189.04
disappearing let me try to explain

6186.37 --> 6192.3
so I conceptualized pretty early on and

6189.04 --> 6196.92
I still do it in a certain way that

6192.3 --> 6201.820000000001
creation is civil Ettore in nature

6196.92 --> 6206.41
because it may literally be a within the

6201.82 --> 6209.7699999999995
mind of the Creator like his imaginary

6206.41 --> 6213.13
capacity as we have ourselves that

6209.77 --> 6216.64
literally that is where creation exists

6213.13 --> 6219.13
at all times and then to say the creator

6216.64 --> 6221.58
believes in you yeah that gives that a

6219.13 --> 6224.2300000000005
whole new perspective doesn't it because

6221.58 --> 6228.0599999999995
he's literally imagining you and if he

6224.23 --> 6231.428999999999
believes in you that makes you more real

6228.06 --> 6234.160000000001
see how that works and one could say

6231.429 --> 6236.65
that if God believes in you that he's

6234.16 --> 6238.9
actually transferring more of his focus

6236.65 --> 6243.129999999999
more of his energy towards you and that

6238.9 --> 6247.469
that would actually enrich you it's not

6243.13 --> 6247.469
funny when you start to think about that

6262.92 --> 6267.76
hmm

6265.04 --> 6269.81
well by the extension of that fault

6267.76 --> 6271.52
seeking Starwood I always thought that

6269.81 --> 6274.1
we are not the Creator

6271.52 --> 6278.27
we are fragments of the Creator we are

6274.1 --> 6281.650000000001
the Creator reduced to incompletion on a

6278.27 --> 6290.17
certain mental level in order to test

6281.65 --> 6290.17
itself but we are individuals

6294.829 --> 6302.65
you could say derived from God

6297.309 --> 6302.650000000001
design-wise when you say

6321.96 --> 6326.28
yep yes it is a gem

6333.449 --> 6339.15
on the other hand you have to see it

6335.52 --> 6341.820000000001
every time you know like lust

6339.15 --> 6344.75
what is lust right lust as we know it

6341.82 --> 6347.16
now is just like obsession with it and

6344.75 --> 6349.92
addiction to us that's really what we

6347.16 --> 6352.739
think of as lost more but basically it

6349.92 --> 6357.9
is just an impulse and that specific

6352.739 --> 6359.94
impulse is kind of like just like how

6357.9 --> 6363.049999999999
animals have it in have impulses like

6359.94 --> 6367.129999999999
that maybe it's even stronger with us or

6363.05 --> 6371.76
we're just more used to giving in to our

6367.13 --> 6375.150000000001
basic impulses on that level and again

6371.76 --> 6377.46
if you had not known about Christ or any

6375.15 --> 6380.429
wisdom or any parents then that and

6377.46 --> 6386.719
there's none of it left it is that lust

6380.429 --> 6389.34
that will force the human to procreate

6386.719 --> 6393.27
because without it and without guidance

6389.34 --> 6399.81
they would simply all die because why

6393.27 --> 6402.9890000000005
would they procreate but as you were

6399.81 --> 6405.3
send in wisdom and oversight then that

6402.989 --> 6408.57
lust you will figure out how it works

6405.3 --> 6411.39
and then you may risk getting addicted

6408.57 --> 6414.63
to it and there were same works for for

6411.39 --> 6416.429
drugs and foods the more you figure it

6414.63 --> 6418.41
out the more you look at what this

6416.429 --> 6422.64
little gem oh that gives you this kick

6418.41 --> 6425.55
it naturally arrives it's the

6422.64 --> 6429.0
consequence of development and it is the

6425.55 --> 6433.6990000000005
test it is the the price the test is the

6429.0 --> 6433.699
price for the development

6474.499 --> 6479.228999999999
that's weird that you say that rikiya

6476.63 --> 6483.59
life because there is something to that

6479.229 --> 6488.409000000001
but maybe it is just a preliminary of

6483.59 --> 6492.110000000001
sin because what lust does is make you

6488.409 --> 6494.478999999999
overlook things about the individual so

6492.11 --> 6495.92
you start to care less the stronger it

6494.479 --> 6499.039000000001
becomes you start to care less about

6495.92 --> 6501.079
their feelings rather than where you

6499.039 --> 6503.09
could maneuver their feelings toward

6501.079 --> 6507.789
mainly the end goal that you want to do

6503.09 --> 6511.219
kind of thing and those acts are

6507.789 --> 6513.44
actually the sin it's not the lust

6511.219 --> 6516.469
itself it's what the lust makes you do

6513.44 --> 6519.969
and if you're gonna do that in what

6516.469 --> 6519.969
fashion see

6523.459 --> 6528.8
that's kind of how I interpret I did

6525.949 --> 6530.688999999999
yeah it's just a little bit more refined

6528.8 --> 6535.269
more consequential as to what actually

6530.689 --> 6535.269
transpired with these things

6562.15 --> 6569.74
right matrix media well that yeah I

6566.73 --> 6572.379999999999
think this realm is similar Tori in

6569.74 --> 6574.24
nature it has seems to have simulation

6572.38 --> 6576.55
alike elements it may even have a loop

6574.24 --> 6580.36
which would absolutely confirm

6576.55 --> 6586.54
assimilatory nature because it's not all

6580.36 --> 6589.0
literal but that does make this real

6586.54 --> 6592.18
because I see how I see it is that this

6589.0 --> 6595.03
literal reality is simply the construct

6592.18 --> 6599.29
of the Creator and that the creator is

6595.03 --> 6601.99
bigger than this figure physical reality

6599.29 --> 6604.2699999999995
so kind of metaphorically because I

6601.99 --> 6606.55
don't think it can get literal anymore

6604.27 --> 6612.450000000001
at some point when you get on that scale

6606.55 --> 6616.42
it is very much as if creation is the

6612.45 --> 6619.599999999999
very imagination of God but it's set

6616.42 --> 6621.82
it's not as free as ours and come things

6619.6 --> 6629.46
come you know it's set its permanent it

6621.82 --> 6633.3099999999995
happens is literally directing is

6629.46 --> 6635.83
imagination that manifests similar Tori

6633.31 --> 6642.610000000001
wise as are created realm that's kind of

6635.83 --> 6645.76
how I visualize a little don't don't

6642.61 --> 6648.089999999999
take it all too literal yet should work

6645.76 --> 6648.09
on it

6682.44 --> 6685.129999999999
what

6686.12 --> 6692.0599999999995
why should i research the Bible more

6688.73 --> 6694.099999999999
before reading it that's that doesn't

6692.06 --> 6698.900000000001
make any sense miss you definitely read

6694.1 --> 6702.31
it first and then maybe see what other

6698.9 --> 6702.3099999999995
people have to say about it

6712.749 --> 6715.409
right

6724.469 --> 6732.2390000000005
research issue I'm gonna read it and I'm

6726.989 --> 6736.009999999999
gonna relay my findings you know I think

6732.239 --> 6742.11
that something as important as the Bible

6736.01 --> 6744.29
needs to be read undistracted I'm not

6742.11 --> 6747.929999999999
gonna insert other people's niche

6744.29 --> 6751.14
opinions or insights directly on top of

6747.93 --> 6753.84
it as I am literally trying to read it

6751.14 --> 6757.4400000000005
blank and literally just taking

6753.84 --> 6759.81
word-for-word to see if I can find more

6757.44 --> 6761.879999999999
structure like the fineness of the

6759.81 --> 6764.63
structure of it the fabric and the

6761.88 --> 6769.29
hidden things and things like what sons

6764.63 --> 6772.53
like how important some words can be in

6769.29 --> 6774.39
order to see that I need a clear mind as

6772.53 --> 6777.2699999999995
I approach I can't just get all these

6774.39 --> 6780.2390000000005
studies right on top of that that would

6777.27 --> 6782.969
severely distract my research as I as I

6780.239 --> 6785.33
read the Bible I don't want to do that

6782.969 --> 6785.33
just yet

6791.92 --> 6798.2
Jesus is not the Sun buddy

6795.31 --> 6803.450000000001
yeah there's a lot of metaphors there a

6798.2 --> 6807.2
lot of because of the whole the you know

6803.45 --> 6811.07
the the celestial system to replace the

6807.2 --> 6818.36
gods that was put there pretty sure it

6811.07 --> 6820.88
was it's part of the format of how the

6818.36 --> 6823.219999999999
story is told to make it consistent with

6820.88 --> 6826.16
that that doesn't mean that that is that

6823.22 --> 6833.63
only that is part of a deception I'm

6826.16 --> 6838.22
pretty sure again as I said the Bible

6833.63 --> 6842.36
can be interpreted in a wide varieties

6838.22 --> 6844.88
of ways and they all work and some of

6842.36 --> 6848.42
them seem to contract contradict but

6844.88 --> 6851.02
they don't they just seem to contradict

6848.42 --> 6855.56
because the people that uphold that

6851.02 --> 6859.1
specific approach will then also say the

6855.56 --> 6863.150000000001
others are wrong and then you get that

6859.1 --> 6865.55
stuff yeah that's that's when you go

6863.15 --> 6868.009999999999
wrong I don't say I say they're all

6865.55 --> 6870.860000000001
right all of them have this correctness

6868.01 --> 6873.110000000001
even though they seem to contradict in

6870.86 --> 6876.08
ways it's just another frequency it's

6873.11 --> 6881.54
another angle to it there's so much in

6876.08 --> 6883.51
the Bible it's just maddening and a lot

6881.54 --> 6888.71
of it was probably put there on purpose

6883.51 --> 6892.39
was redesigned with these effects

6888.71 --> 6892.39
grafted throughout them

6895.95 --> 6902.23
but that does not make one approach

6899.71 --> 6906.43
correct and the other incorrect

6902.23 --> 6912.04
I think that is actually a Babylonian

6906.43 --> 6914.17
effect it's like then people just wants

6912.04 --> 6917.59
to set they want this cetera they have

6914.17 --> 6919.6
to separate it they have to separate

6917.59 --> 6922.6900000000005
it's like Babylon all over again

6919.6 --> 6925.990000000001
they all reach to the depth suddenly

6922.69 --> 6929.71
they no no this is the only way to know

6925.99 --> 6931.48
this is and suddenly oh it's heaven yet

6929.71 --> 6935.68
but I was so funny I ain't know the only

6931.48 --> 6938.169999999999
right yeah yeah it's like a Babylon

6935.68 --> 6940.72
effect suddenly people start to divide

6938.17 --> 6947.4400000000005
even though they don't need to they will

6940.72 --> 6949.72
and they do yeah that's not gonna happen

6947.44 --> 6954.3099999999995
man I'm definitely gonna round out to

6949.72 --> 6956.9800000000005
show now but thanks for the enthusiasm

6954.31 --> 6959.320000000001
it has been very interesting weird for

6956.98 --> 6964.23
Saturday this seems much more suitable

6959.32 --> 6964.23
for a Sunday episode but I guess it was

6964.38 --> 6971.41
it was the time for it so yeah thanks
