142.67 --> 147.28
[Music]

143.92 --> 150.16
right the weather today is

147.28 --> 151.84
yeah turned around a bit more

150.16 --> 154.72
all that blue

151.84 --> 157.84
sky up there

154.72 --> 157.84
pretty beautiful sight

161.599 --> 166.56
so

163.519 --> 169.12
there's still clouds around

166.56 --> 171.599
the wind has cooled off a lot

169.12 --> 173.20000000000002
went out for groceries

171.599 --> 175.599
earlier

173.2 --> 175.599
and

175.84 --> 181.12
yeah it was

177.36 --> 181.12
fairly warm with the sun but

182.0 --> 186.8
yeah when the wind would be breezing

184.08 --> 189.84
past me it it really did pull me off so

186.8 --> 189.84
it isn't like this

189.92 --> 193.11999999999998
sort of warm

191.28 --> 195.68
wind anymore it's now kind of cold but

193.12 --> 195.68
it's nice

196.879 --> 202.35999999999999
so it's yeah it's kind of a beautiful

199.12 --> 202.36
day outside

222.08 --> 227.83
this wire just always gets caught there

226.159 --> 229.28
try to pull it put it back

227.83 --> 231.68
[Music]

229.28 --> 235.84
and that makes the camera go freeze

231.68 --> 235.84
usually anyway i got lucky this time

238.64 --> 244.159
hello goldie mckernan first in chat

241.28 --> 246.64000000000001
uh you're here early

244.159 --> 249.67999999999998
normal dave

246.64 --> 249.67999999999998
mike sidunich

251.12 --> 258.68
good to see you

252.799 --> 258.68
it is wednesday the 27th of july 2022

260.38 --> 264.05
[Music]

267.54 --> 274.32
[Music]

270.72 --> 276.32000000000005
how am i i am okay

274.32 --> 278.96
i feel like pretty good

276.32 --> 281.199
pretty strong but also like

278.96 --> 283.84
i don't know

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
restless

286.16 --> 290.6
and quick to agitate

288.72 --> 292.32000000000005
that i've noticed so far

290.6 --> 294.08000000000004
[Music]

292.32 --> 294.96
we'll see what happens

294.08 --> 298.96
right

294.96 --> 298.96
all these moods all these impulses

299.04 --> 303.36
when

300.479 --> 305.84
given the right idea in the right time

303.36 --> 307.36
i might just be able to like

305.84 --> 308.4
contain it

307.36 --> 310.72
and

308.4 --> 313.84
turn the energy of it

310.72 --> 313.84000000000003
into focus

314.56 --> 319.44
i'm doing my best

316.639 --> 320.72
just because i've slept past early bird

319.44 --> 322.639
lately

320.72 --> 324.47900000000004
thanks goldie mckernan for the ten

322.639 --> 327.44
dollar ship chat

324.479 --> 327.44
i appreciate that

332.72 --> 337.96000000000004
hey jeff gassett

334.4 --> 337.96
good to see you

349.52 --> 352.52
okay

355.68 --> 358.68
um

366.08 --> 369.039
george sanford

371.6 --> 375.84000000000003
right so

373.919 --> 379.19899999999996
apparently nathan

375.84 --> 381.52
is starting a gofundme for

379.199 --> 382.72
flat side for a new computer

381.52 --> 385.28
which

382.72 --> 387.6
probably i was also part of recommending

385.28 --> 389.039
because yeah his voice is just

387.6 --> 392.8
his sound

389.039 --> 392.8
on the show is is atrocious

393.36 --> 395.84000000000003
so

399.44 --> 404.88
let's say if you got some

401.759 --> 404.88
room to help out

405.28 --> 410.08
and do with me then do it with this guy

408.4 --> 413.75899999999996
because i mean

410.08 --> 413.75899999999996
he's a pretty good video maker

415.84 --> 419.75899999999996
and i i would kind of appreciate

420.639 --> 425.44
if at least his sound quality becomes a

422.88 --> 425.44
bit better

428.88 --> 433.199
because when he's making like real flat

431.28 --> 435.11999999999995
earth videos

433.199 --> 436.88
with like technical details that he's

435.12 --> 438.56
talking about like i could just barely

436.88 --> 441.039
make out what he's saying it's really

438.56 --> 442.639
annoying

441.039 --> 444.8
doesn't really help that he also plays

442.639 --> 447.039
music in the background

444.8 --> 447.039
but

448.84 --> 452.31899999999996
uh anyway

453.97 --> 457.129
[Music]

462.24 --> 465.24
else

468.64 --> 471.829
[Music]

481.68 --> 484.16
right

483.36 --> 485.91900000000004
i

484.16 --> 487.91900000000004
thought it was a pretty yeah yesterday

485.919 --> 490.0
there wasn't a qe life

487.919 --> 493.84
he was just premiering something some

490.0 --> 493.84
debate it was really weird

494.479 --> 499.52
it was all ready to chat skank and all

496.4 --> 503.28
that but then there was just this

499.52 --> 503.28
discord debate that he did

504.4 --> 506.71999999999997
weird

519.76 --> 523.519
he gets a lot of trolls you're not

521.44 --> 527.12
familiar with

523.519 --> 527.12
well he is south african

528.32 --> 532.88
so

530.32 --> 535.839
yeah that attract attracts other types

532.88 --> 535.8389999999999
of trolls i guess

540.56 --> 543.7099999999999
[Music]

569.12 --> 573.9590000000001
right so what can i talk about today

584.0 --> 589.8
everything out there just seems to be

586.32 --> 589.8000000000001
moving steadily

600.88 --> 607.12
uh yeah yesterday there was a flat earth

602.88 --> 611.959
debate it was pretty cool

607.12 --> 611.9590000000001
it was also part of it this time

621.839 --> 625.7600000000001
but i completely forgot what happened

624.24 --> 628.0790000000001
yesterday in the after show i just

625.76 --> 630.079
remembered that i after the show

628.079 --> 632.56
hung around with brian nathan did kind

630.079 --> 634.16
of round it out a bit early

632.56 --> 635.76
that was a bit of a disappointment

634.16 --> 637.8389999999999
because

635.76 --> 640.16
yeah now i remember like it was a little

637.839 --> 640.1600000000001
slow

640.32 --> 642.88
in the after show

641.839 --> 644.72
like

642.88 --> 647.519
first there was energy then it kind of

644.72 --> 649.2
died down and then like in the last

647.519 --> 651.44
moment

649.2 --> 653.6
i kind of got inspiration and so did

651.44 --> 655.6800000000001
adam and we were just like about to

653.6 --> 659.12
unroll the entire conversation but then

655.68 --> 659.12
nathan rounded out on that

659.44 --> 665.0400000000001
but yeah still had conversations

661.279 --> 665.04
afterward which were interesting

670.0 --> 674.56
uh

671.68 --> 677.68
yeah so

674.56 --> 681.04
depends if if brian is still like

677.68 --> 684.079
in the mood for it but we were

681.04 --> 685.1999999999999
gonna have a discussion

684.079 --> 687.12
about

685.2 --> 690.9590000000001
the celestial bodies and their

687.12 --> 692.72
holographic nature versus some idea yeah

690.959 --> 696.0
i don't even remember what the hell we

692.72 --> 698.24
were talking about the details of it

696.0 --> 698.24
but

699.68 --> 703.8389999999999
yeah we'll see today's show might be

702.079 --> 705.76
interesting

703.839 --> 708.32
depend depending on

705.76 --> 710.079
if brian is like in the mood for that or

708.32 --> 713.399
even present

710.079 --> 713.399
i don't know

715.01 --> 718.21
[Music]

740.8 --> 744.7199999999999
anyway

741.839 --> 747.6
if anybody wants to

744.72 --> 749.279
get technical or do you want my services

747.6 --> 751.6
as a

749.279 --> 754.8
flat earth physicist

751.6 --> 757.36
explaining stuff any stuff about flat

754.8 --> 759.519
earth about the model

757.36 --> 761.519
that i

759.519 --> 763.76
uphold

761.519 --> 765.839
which are multiple could go multiple

763.76 --> 767.92
directions then i can

765.839 --> 770.639
detail explain i can explain about

767.92 --> 772.639
relative density

770.639 --> 775.279
which is

772.639 --> 778.399
well the scientifically viable

775.279 --> 781.36
replacement for gravity which people

778.399 --> 783.839
don't even know what that is so

781.36 --> 784.839
within physics

783.839 --> 787.6800000000001
i could do

784.839 --> 790.32
that could try to explain about the

787.68 --> 793.5999999999999
holographic nature

790.32 --> 793.6
of the celestials

794.16 --> 797.68
or yeah

795.44 --> 800.48
which i presume to be

797.68 --> 802.16
that's what i presume i mean there is x

800.48 --> 803.839
yeah there is nothing that indicates

802.16 --> 805.279
that it is physical

803.839 --> 808.5600000000001
it is visible

805.279 --> 811.279
there's no other viable direction it's

808.56 --> 814.4799999999999
not even an option it's just a direction

811.279 --> 816.0
of thinking right do you want to accept

814.48 --> 818.0
that there's something physical

816.0 --> 820.88
happening

818.0 --> 820.88
yeah there's light

821.12 --> 824.399
is there a position traceable

823.44 --> 827.839
no

824.399 --> 830.399
then what the hell else could you even

827.839 --> 832.48
start thinking about in order to draw a

830.399 --> 835.519
conclusion about what it is then

832.48 --> 837.9200000000001
holographic i mean come on come on

835.519 --> 837.92
people

840.32 --> 845.279
but yeah it doesn't mean that i can just

842.56 --> 847.1199999999999
prove that like on a physics platform

845.279 --> 850.48
that's always been

847.12 --> 853.839
the problem and that's why nathan

850.48 --> 857.04
yeah i don't know but overnight oakley

853.839 --> 860.32
1980 debates letter debates they don't

857.04 --> 865.76
really accept that i just talk about

860.32 --> 865.7600000000001
my model's idea or my ideas or whatever

867.76 --> 874.079
make statements like i think celestials

870.72 --> 876.32
are non-local holograms

874.079 --> 879.5999999999999
can't do that with a lot of size or

876.32 --> 879.6
joking about about it

879.68 --> 884.88
i mean not inquiry or anything i mean

882.0 --> 887.519
people or are they actually asking

884.88 --> 889.68
questions that prove they understand

887.519 --> 892.32
that what it is even is that i'm talking

889.68 --> 894.8
about and in order to test

892.32 --> 896.639
like hey what about this and that

894.8 --> 898.56
element what about this and that right

896.639 --> 901.839
the proof you understand ask questions

898.56 --> 903.68
about it no no that's not

901.839 --> 907.44
what happens over at the flat earth

903.68 --> 907.4399999999999
debate no jokes

907.68 --> 911.279
and the emphasis

909.279 --> 913.4399999999999
on how i don't

911.279 --> 918.399
have scientific evidence even though

913.44 --> 921.6800000000001
yeah it's what is and i have no idea

918.399 --> 924.0
how to even attempt to very manipulate

921.68 --> 927.279
anything about its nature in order to

924.0 --> 927.279
prove that scientifically

928.16 --> 932.56
anyway i don't want to start complaining

930.959 --> 935.4399999999999
all that

932.56 --> 938.399
i'm just saying i got things

935.44 --> 941.36
and i would like to talk about it

938.399 --> 945.839
but

941.36 --> 945.839
even as a hermit i never had the

946.399 --> 953.72
i never went that

948.079 --> 953.7199999999999
like the robinson cruise away level

954.32 --> 960.48
permit where i just start talking to

957.759 --> 962.72
myself yeah i've never been a hermit

960.48 --> 965.12
that just talks to themselves because

962.72 --> 968.1600000000001
there's nobody else right if i would

965.12 --> 970.32
have been i'd probably have like a super

968.16 --> 972.3199999999999
easy show where i could just do this

970.32 --> 975.44
live two hours straight and i wouldn't

972.32 --> 978.5600000000001
even look at the chat just once

975.44 --> 981.2790000000001
not even once i wouldn't even get to

978.56 --> 983.5999999999999
understand who you peop like your

981.279 --> 985.68
account names i wouldn't even

983.6 --> 988.5600000000001
have to get involved

985.68 --> 991.68
i would just talk to myself

988.56 --> 994.3199999999999
in the presence of other people

991.68 --> 996.959
but i don't do that i'm not

994.32 --> 999.6
when i'm alone

996.959 --> 1001.8389999999999
i'm more like one of those monks in a

999.6 --> 1003.519
monastery that has a vow of silence i

1001.839 --> 1006.48
just

1003.519 --> 1007.92
i don't converse i don't

1006.48 --> 1010.0790000000001
think

1007.92 --> 1012.8
even in that region i don't use that

1010.079 --> 1014.16
part of my brain

1012.8 --> 1016.56
when i'm alone

1014.16 --> 1017.6
so i don't have that as a standard

1016.56 --> 1019.8389999999999
option

1017.6 --> 1022.16
i'm kind of dependent on interaction

1019.839 --> 1025.52
from other people also it is it is

1022.16 --> 1027.6789999999999
partially a karmic thing just very

1025.52 --> 1029.839
complicated and basically higher

1027.679 --> 1033.1200000000001
dimensional so don't expect to like see

1029.839 --> 1037.28
any direct logic in it it's just that

1033.12 --> 1041.28
i could go all directions and very far

1037.28 --> 1043.36
i don't particularly want to do that

1041.28 --> 1045.76
but if i do it under the condition of

1043.36 --> 1048.799
somebody bringing that level of energy

1045.76 --> 1052.32
to the table and then me matching it

1048.799 --> 1053.679
then i can literally

1052.32 --> 1056.24
keep open

1053.679 --> 1058.72
the entire spectrum of options that i

1056.24 --> 1060.64
have without constantly worrying oh no

1058.72 --> 1065.4
i'm not going too far

1060.64 --> 1065.4
because i just have to match the energy

1066.08 --> 1069.76
right

1067.12 --> 1071.4399999999998
although yeah beside that i still have

1069.76 --> 1074.48
outbursts

1071.44 --> 1076.88
but even those do match

1074.48 --> 1079.2
their response energies

1076.88 --> 1082.0800000000002
and that works

1079.2 --> 1082.0800000000002
keeps me sane

1082.24 --> 1086.819
right

1083.42 --> 1086.819
[Music]

1093.039 --> 1097.52
if you think you in fact talk to

1095.039 --> 1097.52
yourself

1104.32 --> 1106.48
i don't

1105.6 --> 1109.4399999999998
know

1106.48 --> 1112.4
george effort no that

1109.44 --> 1116.16
in that case i don't think then

1112.4 --> 1116.16
i don't spend my time thinking

1118.64 --> 1123.2
it's it doesn't even feel like thinking

1120.88 --> 1124.7990000000002
like when i for example dreamwalk i'm

1123.2 --> 1126.72
not thinking

1124.799 --> 1127.9189999999999
i'm not having a conversation with

1126.72 --> 1129.2
myself

1127.919 --> 1131.039
no

1129.2 --> 1132.48
i look

1131.039 --> 1134.8799999999999
at

1132.48 --> 1137.6
conjured imagery

1134.88 --> 1139.7600000000002
like visual representations of all

1137.6 --> 1144.6399999999999
things and

1139.76 --> 1148.8799999999999
like they're dynamic it's a surreal like

1144.64 --> 1150.48
3d imagery sort of iconography based

1148.88 --> 1153.2
representation

1150.48 --> 1154.799
of like very complex situation

1153.2 --> 1156.88
throughout time like it's all

1154.799 --> 1159.9189999999999
represented in an icon but it's like a

1156.88 --> 1162.96
graph too so there is a fluidity to it

1159.919 --> 1164.4
even as i look at it it's super freaky

1162.96 --> 1168.32
but it's not

1164.4 --> 1168.3200000000002
like verbal communication

1168.88 --> 1176.44
maybe echoes i might hear echo of things

1172.48 --> 1176.44
that have been said

1178.08 --> 1181.52
but i don't dwell upon that

1183.919 --> 1188.3200000000002
it's more likely that i'll dwell on

1186.16 --> 1192.8400000000001
music

1188.32 --> 1192.84
that sticks to mine anyway

1192.96 --> 1199.4
okay truth tube

1195.6 --> 1199.3999999999999
sorry to hear that

1215.12 --> 1221.039
but i don't really believe you

1217.84 --> 1223.039
i think that you're a

1221.039 --> 1225.44
a troll

1223.039 --> 1228.619
sorry

[Music]

1237.28 --> 1241.28
i mean your account was made yesterday

1239.28 --> 1243.28
you have no content and you have a weird

1241.28 --> 1245.76
picture

1243.28 --> 1247.6789999999999
i think that you are a fictional story

1245.76 --> 1248.72
inserter and you're trying to change my

1247.679 --> 1251.679
mood

1248.72 --> 1254.0
because i just broke open a a can of

1251.679 --> 1256.159
very compacted energy and you don't want

1254.0 --> 1258.64
that

1256.159 --> 1259.679
so you're literally conjuring up a sock

1258.64 --> 1262.72
account

1259.679 --> 1265.3600000000001
to start an entire narrative to draw

1262.72 --> 1266.88
attention away from me

1265.36 --> 1270.4799999999998
fulfilling that

1266.88 --> 1273.5200000000002
condensed frequency that's what i think

1270.48 --> 1273.52
and i might be wrong

1273.6 --> 1278.1589999999999
but you have to forgive me then if

1276.0 --> 1282.36
you're actually a real person that's

1278.159 --> 1282.3600000000001
really in that shitty position

1287.81 --> 1290.849
[Music]

1291.12 --> 1295.6
but uh

1293.36 --> 1298.08
because i'm i'm not talking about that

1295.6 --> 1299.6789999999999
sort of thing i'm talking about

1298.08 --> 1302.48
inner mechanics

1299.679 --> 1304.799
and what it's like for me when i

1302.48 --> 1306.08
am alone

1304.799 --> 1308.559
i don't have

1306.08 --> 1311.6789999999999
verbal conversations when my with myself

1308.559 --> 1314.32
when i think never

1311.679 --> 1318.5590000000002
i mean when i was younger

1314.32 --> 1320.799
that would still kind of happen it's

1318.559 --> 1322.48
it's like a fabrication process it's

1320.799 --> 1324.48
just that i don't need verbal

1322.48 --> 1326.72
communication

1324.48 --> 1328.48
for my thought processes

1326.72 --> 1332.4
my thinking is

1328.48 --> 1336.0
away from the sonic

1332.4 --> 1340.24
and much more towards the visual

1336.0 --> 1340.24
so i use like virtual i could

1340.559 --> 1347.84
virtual iconography

1343.76 --> 1347.84
within my mind's eye

1347.919 --> 1353.2
as i described it's like a 3d i cannot

1350.96 --> 1354.72
iconographized

1353.2 --> 1355.559
graph

1354.72 --> 1359.3600000000001
of

1355.559 --> 1361.76
situations and dynamics of a lot of

1359.36 --> 1364.799
different things happening

1361.76 --> 1365.919
that by the way includes like the feel

1364.799 --> 1369.6
of it

1365.919 --> 1372.96
in general like i'm also always now

1369.6 --> 1375.36
focused on morality like the

1372.96 --> 1377.76
supernatural

1375.36 --> 1380.0
substance that is carried over

1377.76 --> 1382.559
information

1380.0 --> 1385.44
that is morality because it has such an

1382.559 --> 1388.1589999999999
influence and it is a fascinating

1385.44 --> 1391.6000000000001
supernatural substance that's what i'm

1388.159 --> 1393.919
yeah i'm basically saying

1391.6 --> 1397.76
i have a suspicion

1393.919 --> 1399.919
that morality is like a unique separate

1397.76 --> 1402.32
factor

1399.919 --> 1405.5200000000002
because but it's always because of

1402.32 --> 1405.52
information you see

1406.72 --> 1411.32
morality comes and goes with information

1418.88 --> 1422.8590000000002
anyway

1419.81 --> 1422.859
[Music]

1424.799 --> 1431.52
so yeah i'm thinking

1427.76 --> 1432.32
a lot spirit mechanics and energies and

1431.52 --> 1436.799
like

1432.32 --> 1440.48
energy separated from us but like how

1436.799 --> 1444.559
are they separated through information

1440.48 --> 1445.76
like morality is directly

1444.559 --> 1448.96
caused

1445.76 --> 1451.44
by information the information influence

1448.96 --> 1453.919
on an individual where a person

1451.44 --> 1455.919
might not have the information and be

1453.919 --> 1457.919
extremely depressed

1455.919 --> 1459.919
than receiving the information and

1457.919 --> 1462.0800000000002
suddenly

1459.919 --> 1464.88
gaining enormous energy

1462.08 --> 1467.36
based on hope and connection and like

1464.88 --> 1469.44
gaining faculties back reaching out

1467.36 --> 1471.279
again spiritually because of the

1469.44 --> 1473.279
information it was the information

1471.279 --> 1475.44
specific information of some kind of

1473.279 --> 1478.32
situation

1475.44 --> 1478.3200000000002
alteration

1479.279 --> 1482.08
in the favor

1480.72 --> 1484.4
of the person

1482.08 --> 1487.039
or perceived to be in the favor of the

1484.4 --> 1488.799
person could just go through iconography

1487.039 --> 1491.2
that causes

1488.799 --> 1492.8799999999999
them to suddenly be released from a

1491.2 --> 1495.76
clamp

1492.88 --> 1495.7600000000002
of depression

1499.679 --> 1504.64
that's effectively like the influences

1502.72 --> 1506.0
that's a very standard influence of

1504.64 --> 1509.1200000000001
morality

1506.0 --> 1511.12
short-term influence now there is like

1509.12 --> 1513.6
the long-term cohesion having the

1511.12 --> 1516.0
knowledge like for example

1513.6 --> 1518.9599999999998
if a group

1516.0 --> 1521.039
is like very loyal to each other that is

1518.96 --> 1522.559
information on itself and that has that

1521.039 --> 1524.72
information that loyalty and the

1522.559 --> 1528.32
knowledge of it and counting on it

1524.72 --> 1530.4
has strong implications on the morality

1528.32 --> 1531.9189999999999
of the group and those associated

1530.4 --> 1532.88
they're going to count on it and they're

1531.919 --> 1536.24
going to

1532.88 --> 1537.919
have confidence because of it

1536.24 --> 1540.159
but yeah

1537.919 --> 1543.8400000000001
and you could keep going and going and

1540.159 --> 1543.8400000000001
going more examples

1546.48 --> 1550.96
right and i'm not reading this of any

1548.32 --> 1552.32
books by the way i'm not re still not

1550.96 --> 1553.919
doing it

1552.32 --> 1555.9189999999999
this is all

1553.919 --> 1557.1200000000001
like legos in my mind i've been

1555.919 --> 1558.24
collecting

1557.12 --> 1561.4399999999998
virtual

1558.24 --> 1563.84
lego pieces for my mind

1561.44 --> 1566.0
for my entire life

1563.84 --> 1568.08
it's been kind of like all that stuff is

1566.0 --> 1570.0
just kind of stuck in the mud and i'm

1568.08 --> 1572.0
like not sure like should i even grab

1570.0 --> 1574.64
that or whatever but

1572.0 --> 1576.72
over the decades it's been washing and

1574.64 --> 1578.72
washing and now

1576.72 --> 1580.88
you can certainly like start picking up

1578.72 --> 1584.32
the pieces that were always there i just

1580.88 --> 1588.48
didn't really reach out to them yet but

1584.32 --> 1593.36
now it's time and i can already see

1588.48 --> 1593.3600000000001
how it will fit together and it does

1594.799 --> 1598.4
and now

1595.76 --> 1599.6
everything that i have experienced

1598.4 --> 1603.2
suddenly

1599.6 --> 1607.799
has a much more enriching value

1603.2 --> 1607.799
including to my morality and confidence

1611.66 --> 1616.48
[Music]

1613.919 --> 1620.24

1616.48 --> 1623.3600000000001

1620.24 --> 1623.36
are you all shocked

1625.44 --> 1630.3200000000002
that i blocked this guy

1627.84 --> 1631.4399999999998
who made his account yesterday had no

1630.32 --> 1634.3999999999999
videos

1631.44 --> 1637.2

1634.4 --> 1640.3990000000001
everybody's dead and [ __ ] like

1637.2 --> 1643.44
a kind of seems like a made-up story

1640.399 --> 1645.9189999999999
of a typical depressed guy

1643.44 --> 1646.72
it makes absolutely no sense to start

1645.919 --> 1650.0
out

1646.72 --> 1650.0
in this chat like that

1651.039 --> 1656.08
chase them off

1652.88 --> 1658.88
them who's them

1656.08 --> 1661.12
in this instance clutch by the way could

1658.88 --> 1665.0390000000002
anybody

1661.12 --> 1665.039
follow anything i was talking about

1667.679 --> 1672.799
some feedback would be great

1670.399 --> 1674.8799999999999
otherwise it's just me rambling

1672.799 --> 1677.44
you know what it's gonna feel like right

1674.88 --> 1680.3200000000002
when there's no feedback it's gonna feel

1677.44 --> 1681.44
like i'm talking to myself like a nut

1680.32 --> 1684.32

1681.44 --> 1688.159
stuck on an island

1684.32 --> 1690.32
with like a football with

1688.159 --> 1692.0800000000002
with a smile drawn on it with my own

1690.32 --> 1695.52
blood yeah that's what it's going to

1692.08 --> 1697.52
feel like otherwise could be all heavy

1695.52 --> 1699.279
intense and detailed

1697.52 --> 1701.12
when i'm literally feeling like i'm

1699.279 --> 1703.2
talking to myself

1701.12 --> 1706.6399999999999
if nobody's gonna give me any kind of

1703.2 --> 1711.2
feedback as to proving that they even

1706.64 --> 1715.96
understand or have a slight grip of any

1711.2 --> 1715.96
level on what i'm talking about

[Music]

1759.52 --> 1764.84
ah that's great thank you for the

1761.84 --> 1764.84
feedback

1767.52 --> 1772.799
it's a personal thing for me

1770.559 --> 1773.84
right yeah when i explained like how i

1772.799 --> 1775.9189999999999
think

1773.84 --> 1779.039
i get that

1775.919 --> 1781.76
but also about the whole concept that

1779.039 --> 1784.8799999999999
maybe morality is like a supernatural

1781.76 --> 1787.2
substance that is

1784.88 --> 1788.0800000000002
isolatable

1787.2 --> 1789.679
from

1788.08 --> 1792.48
just information

1789.679 --> 1794.88
it's like the response to information

1792.48 --> 1796.96
but the information also in context with

1794.88 --> 1799.8400000000001
the consciousness so it's like

1796.96 --> 1799.8400000000001
information

1800.24 --> 1804.559
plus

1801.84 --> 1808.1999999999998
consciousness

1804.559 --> 1808.2
affects morality

1811.53 --> 1815.9189999999999
[Music]

1814.399 --> 1818.08
that's actually that might make an

1815.919 --> 1821.88
interesting title

1818.08 --> 1821.8799999999999
i think i'll do that

1838.46 --> 1841.65
[Music]

1842.0 --> 1846.48
by the way the way that i'm presenting

1844.399 --> 1850.8799999999999
it here in the title is

1846.48 --> 1854.3990000000001
extremely oversimplified of course

1850.88 --> 1856.72
because we all know that morality is all

1854.399 --> 1858.6399999999999
about the subtle details like

1856.72 --> 1860.96
every little

1858.64 --> 1862.5590000000002
tiny little corner can just sweep

1860.96 --> 1865.2
everything around it's

1862.559 --> 1868.24
it's like a plus minus polarized

1865.2 --> 1870.3990000000001
situation the whole morality

1868.24 --> 1872.96
and just a minor detail could just flip

1870.399 --> 1875.7199999999998
it around

1872.96 --> 1878.8400000000001
so it's not really

1875.72 --> 1881.279
universally stable

1878.84 --> 1883.76
information plus

1881.279 --> 1885.679
consciousness is morality

1883.76 --> 1888.08
yeah except

1885.679 --> 1889.2
that's just a rough outline

1888.08 --> 1892.399
because

1889.2 --> 1897.519
in reality it's a very

1892.399 --> 1897.5189999999998
polarized easily switchable situation

1902.48 --> 1907.039
and yes i just did a triangle in front

1904.96 --> 1911.039
of my face

1907.039 --> 1916.039
also i have an illuminati croissant

1911.039 --> 1916.039

[Music]

1944.96 --> 1950.64
listening more painting my fencing

1948.08 --> 1953.1999999999998
hey take what

1950.64 --> 1955.6000000000001
your offense

1964.32 --> 1968.399
illuminati confirmed for sure

1967.44 --> 1969.8400000000001
i mean

1968.399 --> 1975.6399999999999
if it's

1969.84 --> 1975.6399999999999
confirmed twice then you know it's real

1994.64 --> 2000.7990000000002
oh wax on wax off that's

1997.44 --> 2004.88
that's defense training

2000.799 --> 2006.0
you gotta have have a car for that

2004.88 --> 2008.3990000000001
or

2006.0 --> 2010.88
wash somebody else's car

2008.399 --> 2010.8799999999999
wax them

2017.12 --> 2022.6
anyhow just

2018.88 --> 2022.6000000000001
suddenly got silly

2036.96 --> 2039.679
oh god

2042.88 --> 2046.3990000000001
yeah we were not ready oh god i'm not

2045.2 --> 2049.119
gonna say that

2046.399 --> 2051.2
freaking information see i got some

2049.119 --> 2052.8790000000004
stupid information

2051.2 --> 2055.1189999999997
on the frequency

2052.879 --> 2057.5989999999997
that i usually don't like to attract

2055.119 --> 2059.359
especially to my streams

2057.599 --> 2062.8790000000004
but because we all share that

2059.359 --> 2062.879
information and then suddenly

2063.26 --> 2066.329
[Music]

2068.159 --> 2072.48
i'm not gonna review it

2070.079 --> 2072.48
anyway

2073.44 --> 2078.7200000000003
information plus consciousness is

2075.359 --> 2081.679
morality morality

2078.72 --> 2081.6789999999996

2083.2 --> 2086.2
what

2086.84 --> 2091.909
[Music]

2111.44 --> 2113.839
okay

2114.24 --> 2118.56
that's funny

2116.72 --> 2120.85
i guess

2118.56 --> 2124.02
topology

2120.85 --> 2124.02
[Music]

2133.04 --> 2139.5389999999998
don't see how that's really relevant but

2136.48 --> 2139.539
[Music]

2157.28 --> 2161.6800000000003
yeah i know my i don't know darts i i

2160.24 --> 2165.2
looked it up

2161.68 --> 2165.2
but yeah borders boy you're right

2166.96 --> 2171.52
the whole thing

2169.04 --> 2173.7599999999998
about just

2171.52 --> 2176.4
group dynamics is

2173.76 --> 2178.6400000000003
without constant inquiry and keeping

2176.4 --> 2181.6800000000003
tabs

2178.64 --> 2183.7599999999998
people tend to like keep things in their

2181.68 --> 2187.7599999999998
mind in the same model

2183.76 --> 2189.119
about other people right

2187.76 --> 2191.119
how they

2189.119 --> 2195.119
from their side gotten to know the

2191.119 --> 2197.76
person they like to keep it that way

2195.119 --> 2199.6800000000003
even though in reality

2197.76 --> 2200.48
it is actually more natural when a

2199.68 --> 2202.8799999999997
person

2200.48 --> 2205.92
doesn't stay exactly the same

2202.88 --> 2207.839
but changes in response to just doing

2205.92 --> 2210.16
things in their life and

2207.839 --> 2211.92
have a rich and dynamic inner life when

2210.16 --> 2214.16
they're not

2211.92 --> 2218.32
walking away from everything they're

2214.16 --> 2218.3199999999997
gonna probably change on the inside

2221.359 --> 2224.0789999999997
and then often people

2223.28 --> 2226.7200000000003
that

2224.079 --> 2228.86
they knew are gonna just be like you're

2226.72 --> 2230.3199999999997
not who i thought you were

2228.86 --> 2232.32
[Music]

2230.32 --> 2235.6800000000003
and then even on a spiritual level it

2232.32 --> 2239.119
can start disconnecting

2235.68 --> 2240.839
this has also happened to me

2239.119 --> 2244.6400000000003
a

2240.839 --> 2246.64
lot well in the sense that probably most

2244.64 --> 2249.44
people that i've met in my life

2246.64 --> 2250.94
especially like up to

2249.44 --> 2253.2000000000003
25

2250.94 --> 2257.839
[Music]

2253.2 --> 2257.839
they did not really know who i was

2258.0 --> 2263.599
but i didn't either

2261.2 --> 2265.2799999999997
so there now if they're gonna

2263.599 --> 2267.76
bump into me they're still gonna

2265.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
recognize traits but they're gonna think

2267.76 --> 2275.599
like wow that is not

2271.839 --> 2275.599
what i expected in ways

2276.8 --> 2283.2000000000003
but i insisted like i am gonna keep

2280.16 --> 2285.04
growing even if that means i grow

2283.2 --> 2287.839
outside of what

2285.04 --> 2290.56
other people would recognize

2287.839 --> 2292.72
for what they choose for themselves what

2290.56 --> 2295.599
it means to be human right

2292.72 --> 2298.64
i'm going to literally say like no i am

2295.599 --> 2302.6400000000003
not putting limiters

2298.64 --> 2305.2
on my spiritual capacity i am embracing

2302.64 --> 2310.3199999999997
that i am going there i am going to

2305.2 --> 2313.2
claim these powers and really do so

2310.32 --> 2316.1600000000003
not powers through institutions and

2313.2 --> 2317.68
contracts but powers of the spirit and

2316.16 --> 2320.8799999999997
of insight

2317.68 --> 2320.8799999999997
i claim them

2321.04 --> 2327.839
and time proves that my claims

2325.44 --> 2329.839
actually hold ground

2327.839 --> 2331.92
even though there's no other way for a

2329.839 --> 2335.839
lot of people that bump into me making

2331.92 --> 2337.44
those such a claim to even

2335.839 --> 2340.56
understand what i'm talking about in

2337.44 --> 2343.839
order to prove or disprove it

2340.56 --> 2347.96
but just time will show you that i'm

2343.839 --> 2347.96
right about those things

2357.68 --> 2361.1189999999997
so yeah

2358.96 --> 2363.52
group dynamics

2361.119 --> 2363.52
people

2363.599 --> 2368.6400000000003
just oversimplify other people

2366.16 --> 2372.56
especially in group dynamics and hey in

2368.64 --> 2374.0
a group people do reduce their

2372.56 --> 2376.7999999999997
overall

2374.0 --> 2380.079
character content detail

2376.8 --> 2383.119
to adapt for a broader and more easy

2380.079 --> 2385.76
smoother understanding of other people

2383.119 --> 2388.079
in that group of who they are who they

2385.76 --> 2389.0400000000004
represent to be right it's always going

2388.079 --> 2390.32
to be

2389.04 --> 2392.56
less

2390.32 --> 2395.2000000000003
as to what the details of what they

2392.56 --> 2396.72
contain if they have control over that

2395.2 --> 2398.48
if they don't have control over

2396.72 --> 2401.2799999999997
themselves then they're always going to

2398.48 --> 2404.079
be squirting always going to step

2401.28 --> 2406.079
outside of the what they should be doing

2404.079 --> 2408.5600000000004
and going to be demoralizing because of

2406.079 --> 2411.3590000000004
that because they don't have that group

2408.56 --> 2414.72
dynamic adaptation of their character

2411.359 --> 2418.0
which is actually normal

2414.72 --> 2420.0789999999997
although it comes with very weird

2418.0 --> 2422.24
influences

2420.079 --> 2424.7200000000003
not always good but that's just how the

2422.24 --> 2427.359
group dynamic works with your character

2424.72 --> 2427.359
portrayal

2427.44 --> 2433.119
right and if you don't understand that

2430.48 --> 2433.92
if you don't if you don't basically have

2433.119 --> 2437.92
like

2433.92 --> 2440.079
mastery of psychology inside and like uh

2437.92 --> 2441.839
what do you call it like

2440.079 --> 2444.1600000000003
body scanning that you can literally

2441.839 --> 2446.24
just see

2444.16 --> 2447.92
look upon somebody and then suddenly

2446.24 --> 2450.0789999999997
understand so much about them if you

2447.92 --> 2451.6800000000003
don't have that

2450.079 --> 2453.8390000000004
then you're probably going to

2451.68 --> 2455.9199999999996
oversimplify people

2453.839 --> 2458.56
that you're dealing with in a group and

2455.92 --> 2459.6800000000003
then outside of your interactions with

2458.56 --> 2462.61
that group

2459.68 --> 2464.319
still keep underestimating them

2462.61 --> 2467.2000000000003
[Music]

2464.319 --> 2470.0
because you don't understand how complex

2467.2 --> 2470.7999999999997
things really work inside of people

2470.0 --> 2472.48
like

2470.8 --> 2475.44
even people that

2472.48 --> 2477.92
in group dynamic you would consider to

2475.44 --> 2481.92
be kind of dumb

2477.92 --> 2484.7200000000003
that kind of dumb is simply a positional

2481.92 --> 2487.6800000000003
role that they attain

2484.72 --> 2489.839
because they're not really that dumb

2487.68 --> 2494.7599999999998
they might simply not have

2489.839 --> 2494.7599999999998
peak skills in a certain range

2494.88 --> 2500.0
that made them realize yeah i can't have

2498.0 --> 2503.04
that position in the group dynamic so

2500.0 --> 2505.119
i'll choose the to be the dumber guy

2503.04 --> 2507.7599999999998
that's a choice that's an archetype that

2505.119 --> 2510.56
a person takes

2507.76 --> 2513.3590000000004
a lot of people that seem dumb aren't

2510.56 --> 2513.359
actually dumb

2517.359 --> 2520.96
and the ones that are really not

2519.28 --> 2523.28
actually that dumb but will still be

2520.96 --> 2525.92
able to kind of play the dumber role or

2523.28 --> 2528.96
the beta or whatever

2525.92 --> 2530.16
to somebody's alpha

2528.96 --> 2532.7200000000003
behavior

2530.16 --> 2535.2799999999997
they're usually actually very

2532.72 --> 2537.7599999999998
emotionally intelligent to be able to do

2535.28 --> 2539.8390000000004
that which an emotional intelligence in

2537.76 --> 2544.0
my opinion

2539.839 --> 2545.2799999999997
is more prominent and more influential

2544.0 --> 2546.88
than

2545.28 --> 2550.599
act yeah than

2546.88 --> 2550.599
reasoning intelligence

2560.56 --> 2565.0789999999997
i am very inspired today

2578.69 --> 2581.849
[Music]

2588.319 --> 2591.04
authority

2591.2 --> 2596.0
right well look for this boy authority

2593.92 --> 2598.96
and slavery

2596.0 --> 2603.359
are social dynamic

2598.96 --> 2605.839
effects they are polarized

2603.359 --> 2605.839
they're like

2605.88 --> 2610.96
interconnectivity polarizations

2609.359 --> 2614.2999999999997
right

2610.96 --> 2615.599
power versus the opposite of power

2614.3 --> 2617.3590000000004
[Music]

2615.599 --> 2619.28
and that can happen

2617.359 --> 2621.52
it doesn't necessarily have to happen a

2619.28 --> 2623.52
group can stay depolarized where

2621.52 --> 2625.119
everybody is like treating each other

2623.52 --> 2627.44
like equal and they just want to be

2625.119 --> 2629.119
treated like equal but if there is an

2627.44 --> 2630.319
unbalance in that

2629.119 --> 2632.56
and there's no

2630.319 --> 2635.04
there's no true spiritual sense of

2632.56 --> 2637.44
equality because you can talk about it

2635.04 --> 2639.2799999999997
all day but if you feel inside that

2637.44 --> 2642.16
you're actually the special boy and

2639.28 --> 2644.8
they're all just below you

2642.16 --> 2647.1189999999997
then you can talk all day about equality

2644.8 --> 2649.04
you're gonna have a polarizing influence

2647.119 --> 2650.8
on the social dynamic of the people that

2649.04 --> 2653.119
you deal with

2650.8 --> 2654.7200000000003
it's gonna happen automatically you

2653.119 --> 2657.2000000000003
don't even have to be conscious of that

2654.72 --> 2659.68
if if you are

2657.2 --> 2661.68
if you have special boy syndrome if you

2659.68 --> 2663.7599999999998
think that you are better for any reason

2661.68 --> 2665.44
whether it's some religious reason or

2663.76 --> 2667.5200000000004
because of your wealth or your

2665.44 --> 2669.2000000000003
connectivity

2667.52 --> 2671.359
doesn't matter

2669.2 --> 2675.7599999999998
if you have that

2671.359 --> 2678.4
in you where you polarize yourself in

2675.76 --> 2680.0
in contrast to others to be better than

2678.4 --> 2682.4
them you're going to have a polarizing

2680.0 --> 2685.839
influence whether you choose to openly

2682.4 --> 2685.839
talk about that or not

2688.4 --> 2690.88
anyway

2689.52 --> 2693.68
so that's

2690.88 --> 2693.6800000000003
another thing

2698.48 --> 2703.52
right it's interesting how just being

2701.119 --> 2708.2400000000002
there with an intention

2703.52 --> 2708.24
with a social dynamic position

2708.64 --> 2712.48
like you don't even have to open your

2710.4 --> 2715.52
mouth and you're gonna have like a

2712.48 --> 2718.079
palpable influence on the other people

2715.52 --> 2720.72
i've experienced this personally i've

2718.079 --> 2724.0
literally kind of tested this

2720.72 --> 2726.56
when i was like in a really nasty

2724.0 --> 2728.56
patronizing

2726.56 --> 2730.88
dark mood

2728.56 --> 2733.2799999999997
but would just like i'm gonna test this

2730.88 --> 2735.92
now i'm gonna just go in this

2733.28 --> 2738.88
group that's very open

2735.92 --> 2740.8
and i'm gonna like shut it like

2738.88 --> 2743.92
not communicate

2740.8 --> 2746.5600000000004
but just feel like that like feel

2743.92 --> 2750.319
patronizing this and that they would all

2746.56 --> 2752.24
get extremely uncomfortable

2750.319 --> 2754.88
and like almost scared like there's

2752.24 --> 2756.8799999999997
something weird with this guy

2754.88 --> 2759.6800000000003
just because of the way i felt and the

2756.88 --> 2762.2400000000002
way i looked wasn't like making extra

2759.68 --> 2763.1189999999997
effort but just being there in the group

2762.24 --> 2765.5989999999997
and

2763.119 --> 2768.6400000000003
they would just feel like wow what

2765.599 --> 2768.6400000000003
there's something wrong

2768.72 --> 2772.3999999999996
without

2769.92 --> 2774.48
full communication

2772.4 --> 2777.6800000000003
that's the polarizing effect right

2774.48 --> 2780.96
that's because i chose to be

2777.68 --> 2782.7999999999997
autocratic with my spirit with my ego

2780.96 --> 2785.52
even though i didn't communicate just

2782.8 --> 2789.28
being there and radiating that had a

2785.52 --> 2791.7599999999998
palpable influence on the other people

2789.28 --> 2794.079
they would pick up on it even though

2791.76 --> 2795.8390000000004
they couldn't consciously make out what

2794.079 --> 2799.119
was happening

2795.839 --> 2800.0789999999997
their inner radar their social senses

2799.119 --> 2802.56
would

2800.079 --> 2806.4
still pick it up

2802.56 --> 2810.7999999999997
yeah and yes i was kind of a weird

2806.4 --> 2810.8
spiritual mad scientist like that

2811.2 --> 2812.8799999999997
where i

2812.079 --> 2815.599
had

2812.88 --> 2818.319
used my extreme moods

2815.599 --> 2819.2000000000003
for social experiments like this

2818.319 --> 2820.56
never

2819.2 --> 2821.5989999999997
harmful

2820.56 --> 2826.24
but

2821.599 --> 2826.2400000000002
yeah it is kind of like mad science

2828.319 --> 2833.599
but i learned so much from it

2831.119 --> 2836.079
i learned so much about just how these

2833.599 --> 2838.56
things are palpable whatever the [ __ ]

2836.079 --> 2839.52
people think about it whatever they're

2838.56 --> 2842.5589999999997
gonna

2839.52 --> 2845.04
incorporate in their books or whatever

2842.559 --> 2847.0400000000004
it doesn't matter it's testable it's

2845.04 --> 2850.079
palpable

2847.04 --> 2852.88
you can test it if you have the senses

2850.079 --> 2855.04
to recognize like oh i'm in a really

2852.88 --> 2857.119
polarized mood

2855.04 --> 2859.2799999999997
it's gonna have an influence people are

2857.119 --> 2860.6400000000003
gonna notice it even if you don't say

2859.28 --> 2862.96
anything you just stand there they're

2860.64 --> 2865.2
gonna feel it off you like you're a

2862.96 --> 2868.0
lightning rod

2865.2 --> 2869.9199999999996
or like a battery that's building up

2868.0 --> 2871.92
tension and if you like if you touch it

2869.92 --> 2874.079
you could like get shocked that sort of

2871.92 --> 2876.64
effect you don't see it but you feel it

2874.079 --> 2879.76
you feel it at a distance

2876.64 --> 2881.7599999999998
there's no communication required in

2879.76 --> 2883.92
order to pick that up

2881.76 --> 2887.8
somebody can keep it in themselves and

2883.92 --> 2887.8
will still be palpable

2900.24 --> 2906.16
right and by the way this influence

2903.839 --> 2908.0
does not have any

2906.16 --> 2910.8799999999997
physical limits

2908.0 --> 2914.119
it's not like magnetism

2910.88 --> 2914.119
it is

2916.0 --> 2920.96
it it has no distance

2919.359 --> 2923.68
because

2920.96 --> 2925.839
or at least no it doesn't have distance

2923.68 --> 2927.68
i i can prove it why

2925.839 --> 2929.359
because

2927.68 --> 2932.0789999999997
the census

2929.359 --> 2935.52
of what i talked about is palpable

2932.079 --> 2938.7200000000003
even online even when i'm with the guys

2935.52 --> 2938.72
on the flat earth debates

2939.04 --> 2943.7599999999998
and they are

2941.28 --> 2944.5400000000004
halfway around the world

2943.76 --> 2946.2400000000002
but through

2944.54 --> 2948.319
[Music]

2946.24 --> 2951.1189999999997
through the voices

2948.319 --> 2952.88
you can also pick it up through voices

2951.119 --> 2955.04
you cannot pick it up through pure

2952.88 --> 2958.4
silence at a distance you have to have

2955.04 --> 2960.72
some input either it is just somebody's

2958.4 --> 2963.839
body

2960.72 --> 2963.839
like how they are

2967.28 --> 2970.88
how do you say that damn it

2969.04 --> 2972.64
how they are composing themselves

2970.88 --> 2974.8
physically or

2972.64 --> 2976.8799999999997
if you have no visuals no presence of

2974.8 --> 2978.1600000000003
them visually

2976.88 --> 2980.48
just how

2978.16 --> 2982.839
they talk right just

2980.48 --> 2986.16
you're gonna pick up the

2982.839 --> 2988.4
traces of their inner morality of like

2986.16 --> 2989.52
if they're polarized in a social way or

2988.4 --> 2991.119
not

2989.52 --> 2994.96
you're gonna pick it up

2991.119 --> 2996.8
even if that person did not intend to

2994.96 --> 2998.559
be like that

2996.8 --> 3001.52
and then people have their own responses

2998.559 --> 3003.76
and we've had like weird conflicts among

3001.52 --> 3007.52
one another because of this

3003.76 --> 3009.76
because some like we all have a tendency

3007.52 --> 3014.24
like i have it and when i get it i get

3009.76 --> 3014.2400000000002
it really bad brian also has it

3014.319 --> 3018.0
very noticeably for me

3016.319 --> 3020.64
and

3018.0 --> 3022.88
nathan also has it but he's he's got it

3020.64 --> 3024.16
really under

3022.88 --> 3026.8
yeah

3024.16 --> 3028.24
under a tight grip in many ways

3026.8 --> 3029.8390000000004
but

3028.24 --> 3032.319
i could we could just notice it from

3029.839 --> 3035.2799999999997
each other and we even have been trying

3032.319 --> 3038.5589999999997
to point things out

3035.28 --> 3040.88
like hey i'm noticing this

3038.559 --> 3043.3590000000004
thing is though that i have i can

3040.88 --> 3045.76
actually describe in detail and almost

3043.359 --> 3045.7599999999998
to a

3045.92 --> 3051.52
physics level i can almost describe

3049.119 --> 3054.559
these things and try to

3051.52 --> 3057.44
categorize them within some potential

3054.559 --> 3059.76
future framework understanding

3057.44 --> 3062.559
which could connect to physics

3059.76 --> 3066.48
that's why i started to say like maybe

3062.559 --> 3069.92
morality is a supernatural substance

3066.48 --> 3072.559
just like information is a substance

3069.92 --> 3075.52
a morality is like a very specific

3072.559 --> 3077.28
classification of that same supernatural

3075.52 --> 3079.359
substance

3077.28 --> 3081.8390000000004
and it is but it because it's

3079.359 --> 3084.16
it's not just the information it's the

3081.839 --> 3086.7999999999997
response to the information and its

3084.16 --> 3086.7999999999997
influence

3087.28 --> 3090.28
anyway

3092.94 --> 3100.03
[Music]

3101.52 --> 3105.8
yes we just seen it indeed

3114.8 --> 3121.44
i hope you are finding this subject all

3118.319 --> 3121.44
very interesting i

3122.839 --> 3126.64
do for a record

3128.0 --> 3132.04
but i appreciate the feedback

3159.839 --> 3165.04
it's just funny to me that

3161.839 --> 3167.2799999999997
things that has have such a massive

3165.04 --> 3170.4
influence

3167.28 --> 3172.1600000000003
like a really big influence on people's

3170.4 --> 3174.88
lives all people

3172.16 --> 3177.359
because everybody deals with it

3174.88 --> 3178.839
and that it remains

3177.359 --> 3181.7599999999998
just

3178.839 --> 3186.7999999999997
culturally elusive like

3181.76 --> 3186.8
there aren't even standard words

3188.079 --> 3192.319
that are

3189.599 --> 3194.4
normal to everybody to describe exactly

3192.319 --> 3195.599
like oh this that

3194.4 --> 3199.28
right

3195.599 --> 3201.76
i had to basically improvisingly

3199.28 --> 3203.8390000000004
try to fit the right words to

3201.76 --> 3207.76
provide you with the framework for

3203.839 --> 3210.16
describing what i'm talking about

3207.76 --> 3212.48
morality the response within people to

3210.16 --> 3215.2
situation and

3212.48 --> 3216.8
the polarized position that a person can

3215.2 --> 3219.359
take mentally

3216.8 --> 3221.2000000000003
and how that influences socially other

3219.359 --> 3222.96
people surrounding them even if they

3221.2 --> 3225.68
don't speak even if they have no

3222.96 --> 3227.52
information that they're

3225.68 --> 3228.7999999999997
sharing

3227.52 --> 3230.24
right

3228.8 --> 3232.2400000000002
there is no

3230.24 --> 3234.24
standard

3232.24 --> 3237.359
vernacular for this

3234.24 --> 3241.04
it remains elusive even though it is

3237.359 --> 3244.0789999999997
massive in its influence

3241.04 --> 3246.5589999999997
it's like a big part of what can

3244.079 --> 3246.559
literally

3246.8 --> 3251.8390000000004
make or break a person in their life

3270.0 --> 3272.96
right and

3273.04 --> 3278.079
when i talk about like oh my mood for

3275.839 --> 3279.359
today right because i recorded on the

3278.079 --> 3282.4
show

3279.359 --> 3283.2
that's part of the study of that

3282.4 --> 3286.079
like

3283.2 --> 3289.2799999999997
what internal energies am i gonna be

3286.079 --> 3291.52
provided with today

3289.28 --> 3293.6800000000003
it's like what what's the spiritual

3291.52 --> 3296.16
weather for today

3293.68 --> 3297.2
because that

3296.16 --> 3299.7599999999998
happens

3297.2 --> 3301.7599999999998
kind of in a similar way

3299.76 --> 3303.28
it's like we're all spirits in a giant

3301.76 --> 3304.48
garden and then

3303.28 --> 3307.2000000000003
god just

3304.48 --> 3310.4
passes the bucket

3307.2 --> 3312.96
with water and everybody gets

3310.4 --> 3315.119
the same type of energy a lot of the

3312.96 --> 3317.359
times it's never like oh this person has

3315.119 --> 3319.6800000000003
just this all this unique

3317.359 --> 3321.2799999999997
freedom sense and then somebody else has

3319.68 --> 3324.0789999999997
a unique

3321.28 --> 3326.6400000000003
oh that typical pressure in the air it

3324.079 --> 3328.0
that's very rare it's usually everybody

3326.64 --> 3331.359
everywhere

3328.0 --> 3334.48
gets roughly the same type of energy

3331.359 --> 3336.4
and then respond to it in their own way

3334.48 --> 3338.2400000000002
deal with it in their own way

3336.4 --> 3340.799
right it's like oh [ __ ] everything goes

3338.24 --> 3344.64
wrong and you call people up guess what

3340.799 --> 3345.599
everything's going wrong with them too

3344.64 --> 3347.7599999999998
yeah

3345.599 --> 3348.88
but that's part of the energy that is

3347.76 --> 3352.3190000000004
caused

3348.88 --> 3355.28
onto us by god

3352.319 --> 3355.2799999999997
it's what we get

3355.599 --> 3358.319
it's the water

3357.359 --> 3360.24
our

3358.319 --> 3363.839
spirits

3360.24 --> 3363.839
get for the day

3364.079 --> 3368.559
and whatever is in it we usually share

3367.04 --> 3370.799
that trait

3368.559 --> 3372.559
with everybody else like everybody else

3370.799 --> 3375.2
especially if they're attuned to your

3372.559 --> 3376.96
frequency right if you feel very close

3375.2 --> 3379.7599999999998
because you're very alike

3376.96 --> 3382.88
the likelihood for you to receive the

3379.76 --> 3384.1600000000003
same type of energy from the cosmos from

3382.88 --> 3387.44
god

3384.16 --> 3389.04
in the same moment is extremely high

3387.44 --> 3392.0
which by the way

3389.04 --> 3394.88
contributes universally to the

3392.0 --> 3397.839
synchronicity effects

3394.88 --> 3397.839
isn't that interesting

3399.839 --> 3404.7599999999998
spiritual weather interesting for sure

3401.76 --> 3404.76
indeed

3409.93 --> 3413.08
[Music]

3416.4 --> 3421.839
a flatter sage good to see you

3419.28 --> 3424.079
and seeking star water

3421.839 --> 3426.4
this is the premise of my tarot deck

3424.079 --> 3426.4
cool

3426.799 --> 3429.92
weather forecast what energy should i

3428.799 --> 3430.839
focus on

3429.92 --> 3433.599
okay

3430.839 --> 3435.68
but if that is the case seeking star

3433.599 --> 3438.96
wars that is

3435.68 --> 3438.96
kind of risky then

3439.359 --> 3444.4
because

3440.96 --> 3449.28
i don't think you can actually

3444.4 --> 3449.28
like you what if you miss draw you see

3452.4 --> 3457.6800000000003
if you then stick to what you got on the

3455.04 --> 3459.92
cards and what if it's off i mean for

3457.68 --> 3460.96
whatever reason maybe some weird little

3459.92 --> 3463.599
devil

3460.96 --> 3465.2
is on your shoulder like no haha pick

3463.599 --> 3467.76
that one

3465.2 --> 3470.72
and then you get it wrong like i

3467.76 --> 3472.1600000000003
would not want to be dependent

3470.72 --> 3473.7599999999998
on

3472.16 --> 3475.2799999999997
any

3473.76 --> 3476.48
writings

3475.28 --> 3478.96
literally

3476.48 --> 3479.839
in order to determine what's actually

3478.96 --> 3482.64
real

3479.839 --> 3482.64
in that moment

3487.52 --> 3492.799
so to me

3490.16 --> 3496.5589999999997
every form of tarot is always going to

3492.799 --> 3500.16
be secondary like i will never

3496.559 --> 3502.96
allow myself to become dependent on

3500.16 --> 3505.52
dividing a tarot deck in order to figure

3502.96 --> 3508.079
out these spiritual truths i have to be

3505.52 --> 3510.319
able to keep knowing it myself without

3508.079 --> 3510.319
them

3510.559 --> 3518.48
if i become dependent on some device

3513.68 --> 3518.48
and not my own sensory i'd be screwed

3525.92 --> 3532.319
right but it is still interesting though

3527.839 --> 3532.319
because yeah the road does kind of

3533.359 --> 3540.4
describe in ways

3536.72 --> 3542.3999999999996
potential weather forecast influences

3540.4 --> 3545.119
it is kind of what it tends to be

3542.4 --> 3548.48
designed around

3545.119 --> 3551.04
like oh what could typically happen

3548.48 --> 3552.319
energy-wise

3551.04 --> 3554.4
well

3552.319 --> 3557.7599999999998
usually all the cards and what the

3554.4 --> 3561.2000000000003
information associated is comprised of

3557.76 --> 3563.0400000000004
the full palette of what could happen

3561.2 --> 3565.839
so it is a bit like

3563.04 --> 3570.319
spiritual weather forecast

3565.839 --> 3572.64
but then should you draw cards blindly

3570.319 --> 3575.7599999999998
or should you literally just go through

3572.64 --> 3576.96
it until you recognize this is what is

3575.76 --> 3579.44
right now

3576.96 --> 3582.88
until you recognize it through yourself

3579.44 --> 3584.88
from your spirit like this is actually

3582.88 --> 3588.0
matching the energies

3584.88 --> 3589.119
of what is happening here

3588.0 --> 3592.24
right

3589.119 --> 3594.0
that's an important question i'd say i

3592.24 --> 3595.68
guess it depends on the individual and

3594.0 --> 3596.799
how you approach it if you just see it

3595.68 --> 3598.72
like a game

3596.799 --> 3600.88
yeah it doesn't really mean anything but

3598.72 --> 3603.1189999999997
if you take it really serious then you

3600.88 --> 3603.119
might

3605.76 --> 3609.559
have to be careful

3616.559 --> 3619.6800000000003
create your own images

3619.76 --> 3624.6400000000003
now i'm just saying that

3622.0 --> 3624.64
dependent

3625.2 --> 3628.96
i like if you take the word of the cards

3627.92 --> 3631.119
over

3628.96 --> 3632.88
your own sensories that that was kind of

3631.119 --> 3635.52
what i was talking about seeking star

3632.88 --> 3635.52
wars i'm not

3637.44 --> 3642.96
look i i do really like the palette you

3640.4 --> 3645.599
basically made with it it is

3642.96 --> 3645.599
interesting

3645.76 --> 3650.1600000000003
i like the frequency of it

3648.079 --> 3653.319
and i'm very thankful that you sent it

3650.16 --> 3653.319
to me

3679.44 --> 3684.119
what what are you talking about borders

3681.119 --> 3684.119
boy

3698.48 --> 3703.2
ignoring the energies giving off or

3700.64 --> 3706.7599999999998
unable to read it properly well either

3703.2 --> 3706.7599999999998
or both bjcnet

3724.96 --> 3728.16
what are we talking about

3729.28 --> 3733.039
hello at the price of adam we're talking

3731.52 --> 3736.4
about

3733.039 --> 3736.4
spirit mechanics and

3736.64 --> 3744.799
what i suspect to be

3739.839 --> 3744.799
supernatural substance morality

3745.92 --> 3752.2000000000003
because it is so universal

3748.48 --> 3752.2
and so impactful

3754.4 --> 3757.119
right

3755.2 --> 3760.0789999999997
and the funny thing about morality is

3757.119 --> 3762.6400000000003
that it is secondary to information

3760.079 --> 3766.7200000000003
information is supernatural

3762.64 --> 3768.4
so morality also would have to be

3766.72 --> 3770.8799999999997
than it like a supernatural

3768.4 --> 3770.88
effect

3771.599 --> 3775.52
that is caused

3773.52 --> 3777.52
by information

3775.52 --> 3779.839
being received

3777.52 --> 3782.64
through the consciousness

3779.839 --> 3785.2799999999997
and then i expanded upon this

3782.64 --> 3789.68
understanding and getting into like

3785.28 --> 3792.0
influences that are like unspoken of

3789.68 --> 3794.48
in social dynamics

3792.0 --> 3796.88
like if somebody has a very polarized

3794.48 --> 3798.96
inner world and ego they think they're

3796.88 --> 3800.319
better literally than everybody else and

3798.96 --> 3802.96
even though they're gonna say oh we're

3800.319 --> 3804.88
all equal if they literally don't feel

3802.96 --> 3807.599
that and they are like no they're

3804.88 --> 3809.2000000000003
polarizing inside it's gonna have a

3807.599 --> 3811.76
palpable

3809.2 --> 3814.5589999999997
influence on the people that surround

3811.76 --> 3814.559
him or her

3814.88 --> 3818.4
you can literally feel it you can sniff

3816.72 --> 3820.72
that out even though they're not

3818.4 --> 3824.799
revealing information about it

3820.72 --> 3826.3999999999996
you could just feel it in their attitude

3824.799 --> 3830.24
so yeah that's

3826.4 --> 3832.559
morality as a supernatural effect

3830.24 --> 3835.9199999999996
or substance and

3832.559 --> 3839.119
the unspoken about

3835.92 --> 3840.88
social dynamics influences

3839.119 --> 3843.119
that's what this show has been about so

3840.88 --> 3843.119
far

3846.319 --> 3851.16
spiritual weather yeah yeah that also

3852.46 --> 3856.799
[Music]

3854.799 --> 3859.799
do you think some people are born evil

3856.799 --> 3859.799
no

3866.64 --> 3873.52
you see evil requires knowledge

3870.88 --> 3875.839
you have no knowledge

3873.52 --> 3878.16
when you're born so even if you have

3875.839 --> 3879.359
what seem like

3878.16 --> 3883.2799999999997
like

3879.359 --> 3886.0789999999997
aggressive or evil instincts

3883.28 --> 3888.1600000000003
when you just acting

3886.079 --> 3890.799
you're just acting out on an instinct

3888.16 --> 3892.48
you might feel threatened even outside

3890.799 --> 3894.319
of your consciousness

3892.48 --> 3895.76
right like what if you're a really

3894.319 --> 3898.0
little kid

3895.76 --> 3900.48
and you live and everything on the

3898.0 --> 3902.72
surface seems to be fine

3900.48 --> 3905.359
but people around you are actually like

3902.72 --> 3906.16
getting really deranged

3905.359 --> 3908.64
and

3906.16 --> 3909.92
like really [ __ ] up and demonic and

3908.64 --> 3912.48
[ __ ]

3909.92 --> 3915.28
and even like oh black magic or whatever

3912.48 --> 3917.68
right and they don't tell you well you

3915.28 --> 3920.88
might just start to viscerally feel

3917.68 --> 3922.799
threatened and even get like really

3920.88 --> 3924.96
like defensive if somebody's like hey

3922.799 --> 3927.92
come with us and you don't like to feel

3924.96 --> 3929.599
them you're going to be like [ __ ] you

3927.92 --> 3931.52
you could be a very little kid now that

3929.599 --> 3934.48
would be a great instinct now would that

3931.52 --> 3934.48
make them evil

3935.039 --> 3938.1600000000003
no it's your instinct

3938.4 --> 3944.2400000000002
and it could be very savage i've had

3940.72 --> 3945.5989999999997
those i dude i've been in a situation a

3944.24 --> 3947.52
little kid

3945.599 --> 3949.28
that was quite like that

3947.52 --> 3952.799
it went very far

3949.28 --> 3957.2000000000003
and it was literally my berserk

3952.799 --> 3959.92
that prevented me from sustaining

3957.2 --> 3961.52
physical damage

3959.92 --> 3963.359
in ways

3961.52 --> 3966.64
i don't want to

3963.359 --> 3966.64
go further than that but

3969.44 --> 3975.119
because of that triggering

3971.599 --> 3979.039
effect very young i also have this

3975.119 --> 3982.4
character trait now

3979.039 --> 3983.599
does that make me evil

3982.4 --> 3987.44
when i

3983.599 --> 3987.44
tend to take things a little far

3987.599 --> 3991.52
when i tend to get all devilish and like

3990.4 --> 3995.599
yeah

3991.52 --> 3995.599
these people need to be executed

3996.079 --> 4000.7200000000003
and even get all threatening like oh

3998.559 --> 4002.96
you're go like we're gonna get you and

4000.72 --> 4004.72
you can't escape and

4002.96 --> 4007.599
really

4004.72 --> 4010.799
angry

4007.599 --> 4010.799
but still with

4011.839 --> 4016.72
with a remnant

4013.599 --> 4020.2400000000002
of justice when i go there

4016.72 --> 4023.359
right never just ah destroy it all never

4020.24 --> 4026.24
demonic devilish always

4023.359 --> 4028.48
for me means that you still have

4026.24 --> 4030.8799999999997
recognition of god

4028.48 --> 4033.44
what is true and that

4030.88 --> 4036.079
as a devil to me

4033.44 --> 4039.28
a devil not be devil right that the

4036.079 --> 4039.28
devil is a demon

4039.599 --> 4044.079
or rather the people that deal with the

4041.839 --> 4046.319
devil with satan

4044.079 --> 4048.1600000000003
they are demonic i don't think i think

4046.319 --> 4051.599
that the devil probably isn't even a

4048.16 --> 4054.48
demon he is a devil too

4051.599 --> 4054.48
without a body

4054.88 --> 4060.319
but yeah satan is a spirit so it's not

4058.079 --> 4063.8390000000004
even like an individual it's all very

4060.319 --> 4066.64
complicated like that but a devil

4063.839 --> 4069.599
as a devil just think about it of like

4066.64 --> 4072.8799999999997
the dungeons and dragons cosmology

4069.599 --> 4074.559
a devil is like their ultimate enemies

4072.88 --> 4076.96
are the demons

4074.559 --> 4079.599
and they are lawful that means that they

4076.96 --> 4082.0
have recognition for order

4079.599 --> 4085.28
and that they will

4082.0 --> 4085.28
yield to god

4085.599 --> 4088.76
you see

4090.799 --> 4096.4
that can be the truth

4093.76 --> 4099.6
or that can literally be

4096.4 --> 4102.599999999999
the the order the order even within the

4099.6 --> 4102.6
world

4105.6 --> 4111.6
right so but i don't think that

4108.4 --> 4113.679
evil is not born evil is a choice and to

4111.6 --> 4116.159000000001
make a choice you've got to be conscious

4113.679 --> 4116.159
of it

4116.56 --> 4120.56
and then if you're not fully conscious

4118.56 --> 4121.92
of it and you still make the choice then

4120.56 --> 4125.1990000000005
you still

4121.92 --> 4126.719
get time to start realizing what it is

4125.199 --> 4127.759
that you choose

4126.719 --> 4131.679
and then

4127.759 --> 4133.44
upon full realization you can repent

4131.679 --> 4135.679
and that's a true spirit mechanical

4133.44 --> 4138.0
effect that's not a simulation

4135.679 --> 4139.279
it's not an act because if you only act

4138.0 --> 4141.679
it you would

4139.279 --> 4144.2390000000005
not go through the transformation and it

4141.679 --> 4146.64
would be visible

4144.239 --> 4149.44
right on you you would feel it from

4146.64 --> 4151.52
those people like no they're still going

4149.44 --> 4154.3189999999995
down down down

4151.52 --> 4154.319
you'd feel it

4156.799 --> 4161.759
right this is even like part of how

4159.6 --> 4164.2390000000005
parents can determine whether their kids

4161.759 --> 4165.52
are lying or not

4164.239 --> 4169.199
it's through

4165.52 --> 4172.400000000001
sensing that subconscious

4169.199 --> 4174.96
sensing the polarization effect it's all

4172.4 --> 4176.08
unspoken and you can act right through

4174.96 --> 4179.279
it

4176.08 --> 4181.2789999999995
but if you don't focus on the semantics

4179.279 --> 4183.279
and the actions but just on the

4181.279 --> 4186.080000000001
composure and the energy inside and if

4183.279 --> 4188.080000000001
it's polarized tensed whatever

4186.08 --> 4189.759
then you'll see right through the acting

4188.08 --> 4191.0
and this is how a lot of parents just

4189.759 --> 4192.88
can be just

4191.0 --> 4195.199
[Music]

4192.88 --> 4197.04
like their kids cannot get away with any

4195.199 --> 4199.759999999999
lies because the parents just see

4197.04 --> 4202.48
straight through it that's funny right

4199.76 --> 4205.4400000000005
seeing straight through it

4202.48 --> 4205.44
straight through what

4206.64 --> 4212.08
through the material

4208.48 --> 4215.08
seeing the energy through the material

4212.08 --> 4215.08
hmm

4236.64 --> 4241.280000000001
look a psychopath is basically somebody

4239.199 --> 4244.96
that has a

4241.28 --> 4248.32
emotional defect

4244.96 --> 4250.719
and it's up to them and their parents

4248.32 --> 4253.36
whether it like if everybody just fears

4250.719 --> 4254.4800000000005
the psychopath then they're gonna go

4253.36 --> 4256.4
totally

4254.48 --> 4258.718999999999
[ __ ] up

4256.4 --> 4260.5599999999995
but if that doesn't happen and they get

4258.719 --> 4263.679
basically the right training then they

4260.56 --> 4265.679
can learn to deal with their handicap

4263.679 --> 4269.1990000000005
and still

4265.679 --> 4269.1990000000005
kind of go about

4269.44 --> 4275.04
without just destroying or killing

4272.96 --> 4277.679
because

4275.04 --> 4279.679
they can live with it

4277.679 --> 4281.6
and they would like yeah it's it's

4279.679 --> 4283.76
complicated

4281.6 --> 4283.76
so

4283.92 --> 4289.1990000000005
the problem though is that with the real

4286.4 --> 4291.599999999999
born psychopaths with that have that

4289.199 --> 4294.719
emotional distortion not

4291.6 --> 4297.360000000001
inflicted to them but born with that

4294.719 --> 4299.199
like they can usually not tell the

4297.36 --> 4302.5599999999995
difference

4299.199 --> 4304.5599999999995
within the emotional spectrum between

4302.56 --> 4306.96
hatred and like

4304.56 --> 4309.76
destroying things and murdering and

4306.96 --> 4310.96
torture and loving and

4309.76 --> 4314.2390000000005
cherishing

4310.96 --> 4316.8
they don't feel the difference

4314.239 --> 4319.5199999999995
but here's the problem this is actually

4316.8 --> 4322.159000000001
a real problem with psychopaths

4319.52 --> 4324.400000000001
they still have need for emotional

4322.159 --> 4325.199
expression

4324.4 --> 4328.639999999999
yeah

4325.199 --> 4331.28
just like every human being they need

4328.64 --> 4334.320000000001
to be seen in that way

4331.28 --> 4338.96
even though they're deranged so

4334.32 --> 4340.84
how are they are gonna learn to do that

4338.96 --> 4343.52
because if they don't get

4340.84 --> 4345.52
guidance they might just

4343.52 --> 4348.2390000000005
go so oh yeah i'm just going on a

4345.52 --> 4349.1990000000005
holiday for two days and then

4348.239 --> 4352.639999999999
yeah

4349.199 --> 4355.44
people suddenly start disappearing like

4352.64 --> 4357.4400000000005
in a neighborhood a hundred miles away

4355.44 --> 4358.96
like seriously if they don't get

4357.44 --> 4363.28
guidance

4358.96 --> 4364.159
it can't be super dangerous so

4363.28 --> 4366.159
because

4364.159 --> 4369.44
like every human even though they have a

4366.159 --> 4372.4
deranged approach of emotions they still

4369.44 --> 4375.04
have need for emotional expression just

4372.4 --> 4377.599999999999
like all humans it's a mechanic

4375.04 --> 4381.04
that is necessary for the body

4377.6 --> 4384.4400000000005
to process stresses burdens that they

4381.04 --> 4384.44
still experience

4384.64 --> 4386.88
yeah

4387.28 --> 4391.44
i know some things about psychopaths

4390.159 --> 4394.239
because

4391.44 --> 4394.239
i knew one

4394.4 --> 4398.5199999999995
for quite some time

4398.56 --> 4405.280000000001
yeah it's a jesuit guy that i call

4402.719 --> 4407.679
a dude

4405.28 --> 4411.0
i've known the guy for like

4407.679 --> 4411.0
10 years

4418.88 --> 4423.32
anyway what are you guys talking about

4428.0 --> 4433.0
hey ben white

4429.76 --> 4433.0
jim west

4473.92 --> 4478.0
you can be born gay

4476.159 --> 4481.12
no ben white

4478.0 --> 4481.12
absolutely not

4481.199 --> 4485.199
gay

4482.64 --> 4487.52
yeah those weird impulses

4485.199 --> 4488.879999999999
those are

4487.52 --> 4492.2390000000005
all

4488.88 --> 4495.4400000000005
because of social it's a trauma based

4492.239 --> 4498.879999999999
yeah if you turn gay that's basically

4495.44 --> 4502.0
like a form of childhood ptsd

4498.88 --> 4502.0
i'm not joking

4504.719 --> 4511.199
you cannot be born gay you can although

4507.92 --> 4512.719
you can be made like mutated chemically

4511.199 --> 4514.799999999999
or whatever

4512.719 --> 4518.32
even before you're born

4514.8 --> 4521.679
to get a deep disposition to be more

4518.32 --> 4526.639999999999
likely to end up gay or to choose that

4521.679 --> 4528.96
because it is always a choice always

4526.64 --> 4533.08
and that choice has a lot of influence

4528.96 --> 4533.08
on how you're going to develop

4566.4 --> 4570.32
that's interesting borders boy that you

4568.4 --> 4572.239
say that

4570.32 --> 4575.12
yeah that's how it starts out

4572.239 --> 4577.44
mirror responses they just start copying

4575.12 --> 4577.44
things

4577.92 --> 4583.04
and then it's up to the people that

4579.84 --> 4585.1990000000005
interact with them whether they pick up

4583.04 --> 4587.6
that there are

4585.199 --> 4589.36
things missing within the copied

4587.6 --> 4592.719
response

4589.36 --> 4595.599999999999
right the actual impulse from the inside

4592.719 --> 4597.84
that makes you mean it

4595.6 --> 4597.84
right

4598.32 --> 4601.92
if that's missing

4600.239 --> 4605.799999999999
then they actually don't get what

4601.92 --> 4605.8
they're what they're mimicking

4609.92 --> 4613.92
yeah it is a choice single [ __ ] off

4614.239 --> 4620.799999999999
gay is a choice it's a choice you cannot

4618.4 --> 4623.759999999999
be born as gay

4620.8 --> 4628.159000000001
you can be born

4623.76 --> 4628.159000000001
with a predisposition for that

4630.08 --> 4636.12
to be more likely to choose it

4636.4 --> 4641.5199999999995
but gay

4637.76 --> 4643.84
is a internal

4641.52 --> 4646.320000000001
psychological

4643.84 --> 4648.08
identity

4646.32 --> 4651.679
choice

4648.08 --> 4656.04
that is what it is it is literally an

4651.679 --> 4656.04
identity thing

4678.32 --> 4682.32
wasn't the choice for zinno yeah well

4681.04 --> 4684.64
look

4682.32 --> 4687.759999999999
how is it different from

4684.64 --> 4690.56
like being gay and being addicted to

4687.76 --> 4692.8
gay sex gross

4690.56 --> 4695.280000000001
how is that different from a heroine

4692.8 --> 4695.28
junkie

4697.44 --> 4699.839999999999
serious

4700.56 --> 4704.0
how is it different like

4702.719 --> 4707.92
you think

4704.0 --> 4709.44
that maybe they want to stop dying from

4707.92 --> 4710.32
doing that right

4709.44 --> 4712.639999999999
but

4710.32 --> 4715.679
but they just can't stop thinking about

4712.64 --> 4718.320000000001
it they just have to squirt yeah how is

4715.679 --> 4718.32
it different

4719.6 --> 4724.159000000001
what you get born

4721.6 --> 4726.280000000001
addicted to heroin

4724.159 --> 4729.44
or maybe you get born with a

4726.28 --> 4731.199
predisposition that if you ever

4729.44 --> 4733.04
get in the position of being stupid

4731.199 --> 4735.919999999999
enough to try that you're very much

4733.04 --> 4737.36
going to be addicted to it

4735.92 --> 4739.679
guaranteed

4737.36 --> 4742.5599999999995
more right having a predisposition

4739.679 --> 4743.4400000000005
genetically or whatever it could

4742.56 --> 4746.2390000000005
be

4743.44 --> 4748.4
noticeable from just your family history

4746.239 --> 4750.639999999999
like oh yeah there's been multiple

4748.4 --> 4752.799999999999
addicts or like oh we're all smokers or

4750.64 --> 4755.92
something right this type of addiction

4752.8 --> 4759.84
predisposition guess what it's still a

4755.92 --> 4764.159
choice it's a choice

4759.84 --> 4766.719
you don't get born a heroin addict

4764.159 --> 4768.32
you don't get born

4766.719 --> 4773.2390000000005
a smoker

4768.32 --> 4773.239
and you don't get born gay

4778.8 --> 4783.12
so gay is an addiction

4780.8 --> 4783.12
yeah

4786.4 --> 4792.0
you get

4788.48 --> 4794.879999999999
you allow yourself to dwell upon certain

4792.0 --> 4797.199
ideas and fantasies and then

4794.88 --> 4798.4800000000005
you get addicted

4797.199 --> 4799.919999999999
yeah

4798.48 --> 4802.32
and just like

4799.92 --> 4805.28
addiction to heavy drugs

4802.32 --> 4806.96
can have a lot of super hard sickness as

4805.28 --> 4810.88
a side effect because yeah heroin

4806.96 --> 4810.88
junkies dude they get really sick

4811.199 --> 4816.879999999999
like if they can't get their shot right

4814.0 --> 4820.08
or whatever they get sick

4816.88 --> 4822.159000000001
yeah guess what being gay and then thank

4820.08 --> 4824.719
god i don't know from personal

4822.159 --> 4827.92
experience in the physical world

4824.719 --> 4831.28
it gets you sick it gets you really sick

4827.92 --> 4832.96
oh you learn to just push past that yeah

4831.28 --> 4836.4
yeah

4832.96 --> 4840.4800000000005
just like heroin addicts just have to

4836.4 --> 4841.679
push past that you can't stop doing that

4840.48 --> 4845.638999999999
i mean

4841.679 --> 4845.639
it's what you are now

4852.88 --> 4856.719
oh you can't be more incorrect well i

4855.04 --> 4858.639
don't care

4856.719 --> 4860.4
i don't care ben white

4858.639 --> 4861.92
i know what i'm talking about

4860.4 --> 4866.0
it's the same

4861.92 --> 4868.08
gay is a choice it is an identity based

4866.0 --> 4871.12
choice

4868.08 --> 4873.44
it is an atheistic choice because

4871.12 --> 4875.84
otherwise it's just satanic and even

4873.44 --> 4875.839999999999
worse

4877.199 --> 4882.32
it is a choice you don't get born like

4879.84 --> 4884.0
that you might have impulses that make

4882.32 --> 4885.28
you seem

4884.0 --> 4887.199
gay

4885.28 --> 4890.4
that other people would typically

4887.199 --> 4892.799999999999
associate with gay but that doesn't make

4890.4 --> 4895.12
you gay that just makes other people

4892.8 --> 4898.08
dicks that are going to project onto you

4895.12 --> 4901.36
that they want you to be gay

4898.08 --> 4904.0
as long as you don't choose to be that

4901.36 --> 4907.28
you're not gay and you don't get

4904.0 --> 4908.88
addicted to the gross

4907.28 --> 4911.759999999999
gay [ __ ]

4908.88 --> 4913.6
because you don't let it in

4911.76 --> 4915.6
you don't let it into your mind into

4913.6 --> 4920.08
your soul where it's gonna poison you

4915.6 --> 4920.08
forever and drain you of all sensibility

4924.719 --> 4929.52
so i don't care that you disagree with

4927.44 --> 4932.5599999999995
me ben white i know what the hell i'm

4929.52 --> 4935.6990000000005
talking about

4932.56 --> 4935.6990000000005
[Music]

4956.239 --> 4960.159
certainly got things rolling now of

4958.32 --> 4961.599999999999
course they had to make it all about the

4960.159 --> 4964.239
gays again

4961.6 --> 4968.320000000001
oh they just want the the openly

4964.239 --> 4971.678999999999
homophobic person please just get angry

4968.32 --> 4972.88
get angry with gays we need to squirt

4971.679 --> 4975.76
i mean

4972.88 --> 4978.56
everybody just accepts us now it's the

4975.76 --> 4981.360000000001
stupidest thing ever we're just accepted

4978.56 --> 4983.76
now it's not interesting anymore so we

4981.36 --> 4983.759999999999
need

4983.92 --> 4990.2390000000005
the homophobic guy to be angry at us

4987.6 --> 4993.76
so we can squirt again otherwise we're

4990.239 --> 4993.759999999999
gonna be bored to death

4993.84 --> 4997.400000000001
i'm so sorry

5035.36 --> 5038.92
gender dysmorphia

5042.56 --> 5046.8
yeah i'm not even drawing that shitty

5044.56 --> 5049.1990000000005
[ __ ] right i mean

5046.8 --> 5053.04
how is gay

5049.199 --> 5055.44
the the like identity of being good how

5053.04 --> 5058.0
is that different as in like

5055.44 --> 5060.719
no i know i was born with a penis but

5058.0 --> 5063.36
i'm actually a girl

5060.719 --> 5065.44
how is that different

5063.36 --> 5067.92
is that not a choice

5065.44 --> 5070.799999999999
oh oh you're gonna deny

5067.92 --> 5074.159
that they're actually a girl in a boy's

5070.8 --> 5075.84
body are you gonna deny that

5074.159 --> 5078.719
right

5075.84 --> 5082.400000000001
right so if you think that gay isn't the

5078.719 --> 5083.679
choice then you then what makes you

5082.4 --> 5086.32
able to

5083.679 --> 5088.159
set a different standard for trans right

5086.32 --> 5091.12
because if you're born gay then why

5088.159 --> 5095.799999999999
aren't you born trans

5091.12 --> 5095.8
can you please provide the argument

5109.76 --> 5114.88
you've done a video about it on your

5111.44 --> 5114.879999999999
channel alrighty then

5120.32 --> 5124.0
damn it now i feel gross

5123.199 --> 5128.759999999999
and it

5124.0 --> 5132.159
started like such a great show it's also

5128.76 --> 5133.76
non-sexual nonsense related

5132.159 --> 5135.12
ugh

5133.76 --> 5138.2390000000005
i always have to

5135.12 --> 5141.84
pour in the gay

5138.239 --> 5141.839999999999
i always have to do it

5201.52 --> 5203.92
goody

5205.04 --> 5209.76
i've done a video about it

5207.36 --> 5213.759999999999
a video about what you mean you're

5209.76 --> 5213.76
ripping videos from my channel

5219.12 --> 5223.12
i should have your entire channel just

5221.6 --> 5226.96
deleted

5223.12 --> 5230.0
because you're just using my content

5226.96 --> 5234.199
without my permission to try and [ __ ]

5230.0 --> 5234.199
onto what i do

5238.639 --> 5242.8
have you ever considered just making an

5241.12 --> 5244.0
argument

5242.8 --> 5246.639
huh

5244.0 --> 5248.56
them versus them versus us just making

5246.639 --> 5249.4400000000005
an argument just

5248.56 --> 5251.6
oh

5249.44 --> 5255.44
you disagree with this

5251.6 --> 5255.4400000000005
well make an argument then

5265.04 --> 5271.679
did it ages ago yeah i know

5268.08 --> 5273.92
i have talked about it openly

5271.679 --> 5276.4
and now all the [ __ ] gays are all

5273.92 --> 5279.93
trying to stalk me for it

5276.4 --> 5282.999
because yeah i did once

5279.93 --> 5282.999000000001
[Music]

5289.44 --> 5294.48
i did once

5291.12 --> 5297.5199999999995
hang around people that kind of insisted

5294.48 --> 5297.5199999999995
that i was gay

5298.08 --> 5302.8
and i thought like yeah sure why not

5300.32 --> 5304.639
because i didn't even realize what it

5302.8 --> 5306.0
all implied

5304.639 --> 5308.2390000000005
because

5306.0 --> 5310.32
that it was like all about sex and all

5308.239 --> 5313.759999999999
that with men yes

5310.32 --> 5315.36
which is just the worst that's just so

5313.76 --> 5316.159000000001
gross

5315.36 --> 5318.639
like

5316.159 --> 5321.36
i didn't even realize that that is what

5318.639 --> 5323.6
i was sort of agreeing to

5321.36 --> 5324.4
i just thought oh no that's the popular

5323.6 --> 5326.400000000001
thing

5324.4 --> 5328.159
i was in my mind i was just thinking

5326.4 --> 5330.96
like gay happy

5328.159 --> 5334.08
i was that stupid about it i was a

5330.96 --> 5336.96
dumbass hippie i wore sort of hippy

5334.08 --> 5338.4
clothes and i thought like oh yeah okay

5336.96 --> 5340.159
that's the thing

5338.4 --> 5341.839999999999
oh that makes you more popular and

5340.159 --> 5344.08
people are going to listen to you if you

5341.84 --> 5346.8
say you're gay because that was

5344.08 --> 5349.04
literally the [ __ ] situation back

5346.8 --> 5352.4800000000005
then it was

5349.04 --> 5354.96
that's what was happening

5352.48 --> 5357.959999999999
what the [ __ ] is wrong with this [ __ ]

5354.96 --> 5357.96
camera

5372.56 --> 5378.92
why does it even do that i didn't even

5374.96 --> 5378.92
touch anything here

5384.08 --> 5390.32
i've never had an urge no me neither

5386.96 --> 5393.679
yeah yeah you hear me [ __ ]

5390.32 --> 5398.4
gross disgusting threaten

5393.679 --> 5402.4800000000005
i've never had the urge to do that too

5398.4 --> 5404.4
when i did that that one time like one

5402.48 --> 5406.799999999999
time ever

5404.4 --> 5409.04
one time ever you know why

5406.8 --> 5410.4800000000005
you know why i did that

5409.04 --> 5413.5199999999995
because

5410.48 --> 5417.36
i thought maybe i should just put it to

5413.52 --> 5419.6
the test it was literally born from need

5417.36 --> 5423.28
for empiricism

5419.6 --> 5424.2390000000005
and as soon as i did that i immediately

5423.28 --> 5427.44
knew

5424.239 --> 5429.839999999999
that was a huge mistake

5427.44 --> 5431.599999999999
not just testing that

5429.84 --> 5433.679
but thinking

5431.6 --> 5435.4400000000005
all that time like oh you could just

5433.679 --> 5438.56
call yourself gay

5435.44 --> 5440.32
and that's fine i didn't re that's the

5438.56 --> 5442.080000000001
moment when i realized

5440.32 --> 5444.4
holy [ __ ]

5442.08 --> 5447.679

5444.4 --> 5448.5599999999995
so wrong oh my god what the [ __ ] was i

5447.679 --> 5450.56
thinking

5448.56 --> 5452.8
calling myself gay

5450.56 --> 5453.84
that's the stupidest thing you've ever

5452.8 --> 5456.08
done

5453.84 --> 5459.84
that's what i thought that's my response

5456.08 --> 5461.5199999999995
to that thing yeah that wasn't a need

5459.84 --> 5462.639
i've never

5461.52 --> 5464.8
ever

5462.639 --> 5467.52
had a need

5464.8 --> 5473.679
to do anything like that it's [ __ ]

5467.52 --> 5473.679
gross it makes me physically nauseated

5493.44 --> 5496.08
that's just

5494.96 --> 5499.12
[ __ ]

5496.08 --> 5502.08
clutch that's dude

5499.12 --> 5504.8
that's joe rogan level

5502.08 --> 5506.719
of gay joke clutch

5504.8 --> 5509.04
are you even looking at what you're

5506.719 --> 5509.04
saying

5509.36 --> 5512.36
god

5532.719 --> 5535.92
okay adam

5540.56 --> 5544.84
what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

5546.159 --> 5551.759999999999
you actually did it yeah yeah you know

5548.4 --> 5553.679
why you [ __ ] [ __ ] i just told you

5551.76 --> 5556.159000000001
why

5553.679 --> 5558.96
i told you exactly the angle of approach

5556.159 --> 5562.799999999999
for the entire situation

5558.96 --> 5564.719
never had the impulse i just felt i need

5562.8 --> 5568.56
to test whether

5564.719 --> 5568.56
this there is something there

5569.199 --> 5572.799999999999
did not feel like um oh i'm gonna do

5571.679 --> 5575.76
that

5572.8 --> 5578.8
no never

5575.76 --> 5581.6
i just wanted to know

5578.8 --> 5581.6
i didn't know

5582.159 --> 5589.719
and after that i knew like holy [ __ ]

5585.36 --> 5589.719
what the hell was i ever thinking

5596.239 --> 5599.919999999999
the fact that you have such a strong

5597.679 --> 5602.639
reaction against gay people tells me a

5599.92 --> 5605.1990000000005
story yeah you know why

5602.639 --> 5607.6
because every time

5605.199 --> 5610.239
i just get sick because

5607.6 --> 5612.88
physically ill and those freaking gay

5610.239 --> 5616.239
people yeah you think that the whole

5612.88 --> 5620.08
story about that that one incident that

5616.239 --> 5622.159
that was the end of it no after that

5620.08 --> 5623.76
these gay guys

5622.159 --> 5625.679
on the scene

5623.76 --> 5628.4800000000005
kept kind of like

5625.679 --> 5631.679
stalking me almost and they didn't like

5628.48 --> 5634.159
get really [ __ ] up evil or dark

5631.679 --> 5635.6
but they would like no you're gay we

5634.159 --> 5638.32
just have to

5635.6 --> 5640.88
change your mind and they were like

5638.32 --> 5643.679
trying and it was [ __ ] gross and it

5640.88 --> 5646.2390000000005
was like get away from me man

5643.679 --> 5648.08
just get the [ __ ] away from me

5646.239 --> 5651.28
yeah that's

5648.08 --> 5654.719
where my strong reaction against gay

5651.28 --> 5655.92
people came from yeah it's [ __ ] gross

5654.719 --> 5656.88
gay

5655.92 --> 5660.32
people

5656.88 --> 5661.679
trying to rape me and i'm [ __ ] sick

5660.32 --> 5664.32
of it

5661.679 --> 5667.8
yeah that's where it came from you

5664.32 --> 5667.799999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

5673.69 --> 5677.2699999999995
[Music]

5698.4 --> 5701.4
now

5703.6 --> 5707.1990000000005
yeah

5704.4 --> 5709.599999999999
and i have a very weird internal story

5707.199 --> 5712.0
even about it which is hilarious since

5709.6 --> 5714.2390000000005
everything i've learned like from

5712.0 --> 5716.639
when benjamin talks about because you

5714.239 --> 5719.36
know what my immediate conclusion was

5716.639 --> 5720.88
after that yeah it wasn't over after

5719.36 --> 5723.5199999999995
just that

5720.88 --> 5726.56
you know what i concluded

5723.52 --> 5728.8
and yes it's okay to laugh

5726.56 --> 5732.56
after that point i actually concluded i

5728.8 --> 5732.56
was a lesbian in a man's body

5735.36 --> 5740.0
so yeah

5737.119 --> 5743.159
gross encounter with men turned me into

5740.0 --> 5743.159
a lesbian

5743.199 --> 5748.48
that's just the irony of that in

5745.6 --> 5751.119000000001
retrospect is just

5748.48 --> 5751.119
hilarious

5751.52 --> 5755.4400000000005
but you could just think of me as

5752.88 --> 5757.04
heterosexual

5755.44 --> 5759.36
because i am

5757.04 --> 5761.92
and i was born a man

5759.36 --> 5764.159
and i really do like women and i'm drawn

5761.92 --> 5766.08
to women

5764.159 --> 5766.799999999999
a lot more

5766.08 --> 5768.08
like

5766.8 --> 5771.679
as in

5768.08 --> 5775.5199999999995
100 versus like not being drawn to men

5771.679 --> 5775.52
except for like brotherly

5775.639 --> 5782.96
compatriotism and just like being bros

5780.639 --> 5782.96
yeah

5783.119 --> 5789.04
so yeah you want to call me trans

5785.92 --> 5791.119
okay fine i'm i'm a lesbian in a man's

5789.04 --> 5794.32
body okay

5791.119 --> 5794.32
you satisfied now

5795.199 --> 5802.4
i'm not gay

5798.719 --> 5804.88
like that technically cancels out any

5802.4 --> 5807.96
perception of gay right

5804.88 --> 5807.96
i mean

5813.679 --> 5818.96
bros before hoes indeed

5816.32 --> 5822.349999999999
that's a lesson that yeah

5818.96 --> 5829.28
that i've definitely stuck to also

5822.35 --> 5831.92
[Music]

5829.28 --> 5835.28
right and so on that very silly notion

5831.92 --> 5835.28
i'm gonna round up the show

5835.84 --> 5840.1990000000005
i don't know how it came to this

5841.84 --> 5845.92
which if

5843.36 --> 5849.679
i wouldn't know them versus them versus

5845.92 --> 5853.36
us because i'm not and i refuse to even

5849.679 --> 5857.36
imagine yeah i've very successfully

5853.36 --> 5859.28
avoided using my empathic insight

5857.36 --> 5863.44
and

5859.28 --> 5867.36
character acting skills to even imagine

5863.44 --> 5870.96
what it is like to be gay you get it

5867.36 --> 5872.08
that's how much i do not choose to be

5870.96 --> 5874.88
gay

5872.08 --> 5878.239
i don't even want to think about how

5874.88 --> 5881.6
they think about things yeah that's how

5878.239 --> 5883.119
much i'm disgusted with it them versus

5881.6 --> 5885.04
them versus us

5883.119 --> 5888.0
are you hearing me

5885.04 --> 5888.0
i don't know

5888.239 --> 5894.239
what it would be like if i were gay

5890.88 --> 5897.2390000000005
because i'm not i never was i never will

5894.239 --> 5897.239
be

5898.48 --> 5904.638999999999
avoiding it no i refuse

5902.48 --> 5907.799999999999
i'm just not going to try to imagine

5904.639 --> 5910.639
that because even allowing any such

5907.8 --> 5913.6
considerations into your head is gonna

5910.639 --> 5914.88
poison you it does

5913.6 --> 5916.88
it does

5914.88 --> 5920.0
it does every time

5916.88 --> 5922.2390000000005
yeah tolerating gaze

5920.0 --> 5925.76
even in your mind

5922.239 --> 5929.678999999999
it causes to rub off on you yeah

5925.76 --> 5932.639
before you know it you're gay

5929.679 --> 5934.719
are you gay them versus them versus us i

5932.639 --> 5936.08
think you're gay

5934.719 --> 5937.36
seem to be

5936.08 --> 5939.84
very

5937.36 --> 5942.88
very interested in all that

5939.84 --> 5942.88
are you a groomer

5943.36 --> 5947.36
do you like to groom people them versus

5945.679 --> 5948.96
them versus us

5947.36 --> 5952.679
are you a gay

5948.96 --> 5952.679
gross groomer

5953.48 --> 5956.65
[Music]

5964.32 --> 5968.88
you never kissed a guy but

5967.119 --> 5971.679
why then

5968.88 --> 5973.28
dwell on this [ __ ] why being constantly

5971.679 --> 5976.32
bringing that up i mean if you're

5973.28 --> 5977.199
constantly talking about gay

5976.32 --> 5978.96
right

5977.199 --> 5981.5199999999995
that's an indicator that you might be

5978.96 --> 5984.08
obsessed with gay

5981.52 --> 5986.2390000000005
when you're obsessed with gay

5984.08 --> 5987.199
you're gay

5986.239 --> 5988.879999999999
get it

5987.199 --> 5990.32
[ __ ] wit

5988.88 --> 5992.639
yeah

5990.32 --> 5992.639
get it

5992.719 --> 5997.679

no actually it's very very

6047.679 --> 6051.52
very much recorded

6049.6 --> 6054.320000000001
doesn't even matter if like the messages

6051.52 --> 6058.159000000001
are removed in the chat or anything it's

6054.32 --> 6060.48
very much visually recorded that you

6058.159 --> 6061.599999999999
yeah them versus them versus us brought

6060.48 --> 6065.638999999999
it up

6061.6 --> 6065.639
yeah you did that

6068.56 --> 6074.320000000001
ben white brought it up

6071.36 --> 6076.4
that's a fair enough statement

6074.32 --> 6079.04
he did actually kind of bring it up and

6076.4 --> 6082.799999999999
then damn versus them versus us started

6079.04 --> 6086.719
to roll out the slander

6082.8 --> 6088.400000000001
then he said oh no you're you are gay

6086.719 --> 6091.52
yeah

6088.4 --> 6094.719
yeah who must be no you were you're you

6091.52 --> 6095.52
were the one that was actually accusing

6094.719 --> 6097.6
yeah

6095.52 --> 6100.2390000000005
me and ben

6097.6 --> 6101.679
were actually talking about

6100.239 --> 6104.959999999999
whether

6101.679 --> 6106.4800000000005
people are born gay or not and i think

6104.96 --> 6108.96
we're not and we were having a

6106.48 --> 6110.5599999999995
discussion about that not about who is

6108.96 --> 6112.4800000000005
gay or not

6110.56 --> 6114.4800000000005

you did that you were the one that

6119.28 --> 6124.32

6122.08 --> 6126.96
you understand you cannot remove that

6124.32 --> 6128.799999999999
evidence you brought that up

6126.96 --> 6130.8
because you're gay

6128.8 --> 6134.320000000001
you're obsessed with me

6130.8 --> 6136.320000000001
allegedly being gay according to you

6263.28 --> 6268.0
worth continuing the show

6266.719 --> 6270.08
right

6268.0 --> 6273.84
so

6270.08 --> 6305.14
until the next video keep it flat

6273.84 --> 6305.14
