3.29 --> 10.530000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.87 --> 15.54
early-bird number 74 I'm your host

10.53 --> 18.509999999999998
Arwen and well today's quite a different

15.54 --> 28.89
picture from yesterday take a look at

18.51 --> 33.93
this yeah it's like it's this the same

28.89 --> 38.04
place it is but now everything's covered

33.93 --> 41.1
in snow so this is the first time this

38.04 --> 44.539
year it's snowing make sense to me

41.1 --> 48.39
because every time my birthday comes up

44.539 --> 51.300000000000004
like in a couple of weeks for some

48.39 --> 53.789
reason it starts to snow and then

51.3 --> 56.038999999999994
usually when my birthday is over it

53.789 --> 59.730000000000004
stops snowing so it is very typical for

56.039 --> 61.649
me every time it is just like it's

59.73 --> 64.229
coming out of absolutely nowhere just

61.649 --> 66.06
suddenly started snowing and that it

64.229 --> 68.479
stops again like ever ever nothing ever

66.06 --> 68.479
happened

71.21 --> 77.89999999999999
all right guys yeah I have now been

75.98 --> 82.67
fully monetized you may have already

77.9 --> 85.64
seen a an advertisement pop up live I'm

82.67 --> 88.25
not too sure if it does if you look back

85.64 --> 94.31
at older videos yesterday's videos

88.25 --> 98.57
they're there and yeah I'm not asking

94.31 --> 102.14
you to buy those products but if you

98.57 --> 105.47
click on it go to their site for just a

102.14 --> 108.88
second it will register for me and that

105.47 --> 113.869
will help me out will make me more

108.88 --> 115.64
viable for advertisers to sponsor me

113.869 --> 118.52
through the advertisement salesman so

115.64 --> 120.68
yeah do that or not just click it away I

118.52 --> 126.47
don't know whatever you want also yeah

120.68 --> 130.399
the super chat is now open so yeah we'll

126.47 --> 133.19
be ironic did mean I never got anything

130.399 --> 137.299
out of that because yeah I already got I

133.19 --> 139.64
got donations through PayPal already but

137.299 --> 142.34
yeah if you got the super chat and you

139.64 --> 144.85999999999999
think you have special message or

142.34 --> 150.43
anything special question you could

144.86 --> 154.78
always do that even if you're a troll a

150.43 --> 154.78
constant morning

155.97 --> 164.52
yeah Constance I been wanting to contact

159.75 --> 168.51
you over over Skype and you don't seem

164.52 --> 172.38000000000002
to have that open a lot because I asked

168.51 --> 175.95
and I called and no nothing yet I do see

172.38 --> 180.96
you in in chats around so yeah would be

175.95 --> 184.57999999999998
nice if you'd pick up the phone I could

180.96 --> 184.58
have really used it yesterday because

184.7 --> 189.20999999999998
yesterday was an odd day for me

187.08 --> 191.04000000000002
hello what else is new Arwen has a

189.21 --> 193.26000000000002
strange day Wow

well you got to wake up for that for a

193.26 --> 202.57999999999998
moment no everyday seems to be a special

197.58 --> 202.58
day these days well yesterday man I

204.71 --> 211.05
things hit me about a tart Ariens really

208.65 --> 212.07
vividly that vision I described hit me

211.05 --> 217.77
really hard

212.07 --> 220.22
it kept lingering and yeah I was a bit

217.77 --> 224.16
silly got a bottle of a red wine

220.22 --> 226.77
yeah afternoon and I drank it up way too

224.16 --> 229.85999999999999
fast in the evening had a lot of fun I

226.77 --> 234.84
was basically being silly chatting

229.86 --> 237.66000000000003
chatting out loud in esis hangout chat I

234.84 --> 238.5
think it was or I don't know I don't

237.66 --> 241.38

238.5 --> 245.9
I don't remember what happens but yeah

241.38 --> 245.9
it got sick certainly

246.39 --> 255.42999999999998
turned into a pretty excruciating

249.39 --> 258.4
evening for me yeah yeah I got really

255.43 --> 259.329
really sick started throwing up all over

258.4 --> 261.489
the place

259.329 --> 263.02
sorry I know breakfast show I'm not

261.489 --> 266.56
gonna describe the details

263.02 --> 270.4
what safe to say I clean it all off all

266.56 --> 274.03000000000003
of it I thank God I didn't like better

270.4 --> 276.52
or anything I but I clean it all up and

274.03 --> 280.419
that's pretty good because if I hadn't

276.52 --> 282.84999999999997
then yeah covered with snow so I'm

280.419 --> 286.03
really glad I covered I cleaning that

282.85 --> 288.1
everything up before and not just

286.03 --> 290.14
decided oh yeah you know what I'm just

288.1 --> 293.26000000000005
gonna sleep through the entire night

290.14 --> 300.09999999999997
just leave it there for my roommates to

293.26 --> 303.01
wake up to like hi no I was great I was

300.1 --> 306.63
a responsible Arwen and they clean it up

303.01 --> 310.59999999999997
and I'm not even sure they noticed but

306.63 --> 311.14
man yeah it happens to me sometimes it's

310.6 --> 313.24
weird

311.14 --> 316.96
again the alcohol it's always weird with

313.24 --> 319.45
the alcohol one day it's like the best

316.96 --> 324.12
thing ever I am so in a good mood and

319.45 --> 327.81
this time it just hit bad it hit a

324.12 --> 332.169
nostalgic note somehow and it hit hard

327.81 --> 334.72
and I couldn't handle it I got emotional

332.169 --> 337.71999999999997
it started to live its own life and then

334.72 --> 343.24
I got sick from it and then violently so

337.72 --> 344.5
and she's that really hurts like

343.24 --> 347.05
physically

344.5 --> 351.34
it's like I feel I could and I've been

347.05 --> 353.92
squeezed out why actually ended up in

351.34 --> 361.83
the shower hanging around there and that

353.92 --> 361.83000000000004
did some good I slept got up it's like

363.06 --> 369.03000000000003
six o'clock in the morning did stuff for

366.69 --> 372.6
two hours then went back to bed and got

369.03 --> 376.28999999999996
up like half an hour ago yeah but

372.6 --> 379.44
alcohol and me this it's a double-edged

376.29 --> 384.24
sword I have some of my most amazing

379.44 --> 386.82
memories confidence-wise what I do like

384.24 --> 388.62
I'm completely uninhibited no I don't

386.82 --> 390.45
hold back I'm not afraid of anything

388.62 --> 392.16
like it literally anything it's like

390.45 --> 396.47999999999996
death could be staring me right in the

392.16 --> 399.51000000000005
face and I'd be you can't stop me and

396.48 --> 401.66900000000004
the other time it's like completely the

399.51 --> 408.84
opposite it's like oh my god I realized

401.669 --> 411.81
that everything is doomed so yeah I

408.84 --> 414.06
thought I was a literary again and I

411.81 --> 419.34
knew better but I felt like I was gonna

414.06 --> 422.09
die oh my first superjet thank you

419.34 --> 422.09
chocolate scene

423.73 --> 430.03000000000003

444.4 --> 450.25
I'm fine with that you know Legolas is

446.68 --> 453.15000000000003
pretty epic character in both the book

450.25 --> 453.15
and the movies

456.91 --> 463.22
slightly

458.73 --> 466.91
less blonde though but

463.22 --> 468.8
these are Legolas it is ah how you

466.91 --> 471.37
distracted me

468.8 --> 471.37

477.199 --> 480.099
what now

494.25 --> 498.8

button

521.58 --> 525.0500000000001

523.01 --> 529.42
I'm gonna have to figure out how that

525.05 --> 531.65
actually works that the superjet pot

529.42 --> 534.3199999999999
where does it end up what's gonna do

531.65 --> 535.1899999999999
with it then I wonder I'm gonna have to

534.32 --> 537.1700000000001
take a look at that

535.19 --> 541.4000000000001
but anyway yeah I wanna do a little

537.17 --> 543.92
shout out to Nathan again because before

541.4 --> 546.68
I went all apeshit yesterday evening it

543.92 --> 548.54

548.54 --> 554.9599999999999
out get the whole superjet thing going

552.02 --> 556.25
and or I already had that thing that he

554.96 --> 558.08
basically helped me out with the

556.25 --> 563.74
advertisement so again Thank You Nathan

558.08 --> 569.0600000000001
for helping me out with the technicals

563.74 --> 572.78
that's really appreciated and yeah thank

569.06 --> 574.43
all of you guys for being on the

572.78 --> 578.87
receiving end of this show and being

574.43 --> 580.9899999999999
part of the show too and making all this

578.87 --> 580.99
possible

584.79 --> 588.4699999999999
I really do appreciate it

588.71 --> 591.0400000000001
and

592.38 --> 595.79
it's so weird because

597.11 --> 604.899
two years ago guess when I first started

600.76 --> 608.899
doing the flatter talks and everything I

604.899 --> 611.899
really felt like I had to do this like I

608.899 --> 614.959
must do this no matter the cost like

611.899 --> 618.16
because I was literally in my mind

614.959 --> 622.0699999999999
thinking like okay because I do this now

618.16 --> 625.459
everybody's gonna hate me yeah sounds

622.07 --> 627.589
weird doesn't it like for you guys maybe

625.459 --> 631.8499999999999
you know it's all free it's so internet

627.589 --> 633.62
whatever me I got fish and stuff to

631.85 --> 638.69
worry about I got a background I got

633.62 --> 641.2090000000001
this weird overarching thing and the

638.69 --> 644.2090000000001
other side and the force is there to

641.209 --> 647.209
worry about literally and I thought like

644.209 --> 649.51
oh my god if I'm good I have to do this

647.209 --> 654.1999999999999
I must do this but it's almost like

649.51 --> 657.2
sacrificing everything to do that to

654.2 --> 662.0600000000001
gratify that impulse inside that I just

657.2 --> 664.85
can't help but apply and well it turned

662.06 --> 669.5889999999999
out there's a whole bunch of guys out

664.85 --> 673.25
there and gals I hope too that do really

669.589 --> 674.8800000000001
appreciate it and that even like stick

673.25 --> 678.49
up for me and

674.88 --> 682.57
every time I see it it's like wow really

678.49 --> 687.149
oh my god this it's not like what I

682.57 --> 687.149
imagined it would become really

688.47 --> 698.0400000000001
I'm glad that my first fears of

692.84 --> 704.88
basically doing that thing like a last

698.04 --> 712.98
resort it didn't end I'm still here I'm

704.88 --> 717.57
still going yeah there was it's

712.98 --> 721.38
interesting there was a video from Mike

717.57 --> 723.96
Adams from natural news and he did that

721.38 --> 727.74
in the segment last Sunday apparently on

723.96 --> 731.39
the Alex Jones Show he has a special

727.74 --> 731.39
segment there what's it called again

735.26 --> 740.85
yeah countess thing and yeah I sometimes

738.93 --> 743.55
he get very it gets very science

740.85 --> 746.73
fictiony globish but sometimes he gets

743.55 --> 750.6899999999999
spiritual and he did that this time

746.73 --> 756.12
apparently and he talking about demons

750.69 --> 758.7
on the other side and how they possess

756.12 --> 762.39
people especially if they're damaged and

758.7 --> 766.1
he related demonic possession one of

762.39 --> 771.38
demonic possession vulnerability to

766.1 --> 774.2900000000001
vaccine damage and like spiritual

771.38 --> 778.89
mutilation that kind of thing and it was

774.29 --> 782.04
it was terrifying but it was very good

778.89 --> 786.21
he said it very very good I was like mom

782.04 --> 792.38
wow he really structured the whole thing

786.21 --> 792.38
and I agree it's true it's true it's

795.86 --> 801.86
it

798.28 --> 806.81
how do you explain this it's like if you

801.86 --> 808.7
become damaged enough by trusting the

806.81 --> 810.77
world because that's basically what it

808.7 --> 812.9300000000001
is like when you take a vaccine you

810.77 --> 813.86
trust the world like yeah this is good

812.93 --> 816.3499999999999
for me right

813.86 --> 819.08
and it actually damages you in a way

816.35 --> 823.85
that it literally takes pieces of your

819.08 --> 826.5500000000001
mind away from you so you lose a little

823.85 --> 829.4300000000001
bit control over what you are and over

826.55 --> 831.62
your feelings over the way you think

829.43 --> 836.6899999999999
just the structure izing you lose

831.62 --> 839.18
something of yourself then everything

836.69 --> 841.46
becomes really hard and so we have what

839.18 --> 844.3399999999999
if you are then confronted with dark

841.46 --> 847.52
forces and they're gonna tell you just

844.34 --> 849.62
you know you're already lost you're

847.52 --> 852.8
never gonna restore it's probably like

849.62 --> 855.11
you could probably restore your lost

852.8 --> 858.79
you're gonna die anyway why don't you

855.11 --> 863.02
join us and we'll give you a great

858.79 --> 866.02
glorious dream at the end when you die

863.02 --> 866.02
yeah

866.15 --> 874.51
what are you gonna do you know you're so

868.67 --> 882.41
vulnerable you you have no hope people

874.51 --> 885.38
they like dislike your damage don't know

882.41 --> 887.8389999999999
how to deal with it properly you don't

885.38 --> 890.57
know a real healer you know that's

887.839 --> 892.1600000000001
actually able to like okay you seem to

890.57 --> 893.21
have vaccine them but you need to do

892.16 --> 895.9699999999999
this and this and this

893.21 --> 898.7900000000001
eat this stop eating that take care of

895.97 --> 902.2
yourself meditate in a specific way you

898.79 --> 905.3299999999999
think about the lights of Christ or

902.2 --> 907.6400000000001
whatever religious angle of that you

905.33 --> 910.7900000000001
like that kind of thing because that can

907.64 --> 914.24
actually help you out of that [ __ ] but

910.79 --> 916.79
now these people walk or just left to

914.24 --> 921.11
their devices and then they go to

916.79 --> 924.13
college they get among other crazies

921.11 --> 927.0500000000001
that have damaged suggests like this

924.13 --> 928.54
Nigam become completely they let

927.05 --> 931.43
themselves become completely

928.54 --> 935.36
indoctrinated into a cult of evil and

931.43 --> 938.3599999999999
destruction and then they get this false

935.36 --> 943.16
sense of security from their ego like

938.36 --> 945.17
yeah I am among my kind the damaged ones

943.16 --> 948.77
and you get the delusion that that's

945.17 --> 953.18
supposed to be that that's good but it's

948.77 --> 955.4
a sub whew it's an apparition it's an

953.18 --> 958.16
apparition in the consciousness it just

955.4 --> 960.56
looks like is that but you don't see

958.16 --> 963.9499999999999
that everything is wrong basically and

960.56 --> 965.54
that you could still escape from this so

963.95 --> 968.9300000000001
that's what I imagine that a lot of

965.54 --> 971.51
these crazy social justice where your

968.93 --> 978.3389999999999
people must be dealing with in

971.51 --> 986.269
it's very tragic and insane literally

978.339 --> 988.839
and yeah I think that I was roughly like

986.269 --> 988.839
that myself

988.86 --> 994.14
decades ago I was said to have been

992.04 --> 996.8389999999999
vaccine damage and the symptoms were

994.14 --> 1001.36
there with me it was my speech

996.839 --> 1001.36
capability was just

1001.69 --> 1007.57
very late at that I the intellectual

1004.9 --> 1011.47
faculties were there but speech

1007.57 --> 1015.6700000000001
capabilities socializing and at first

1011.47 --> 1018.0400000000001
even I just had a lot of trouble

1015.67 --> 1021.06
actually recognizing that there was

1018.04 --> 1024.6
anything else but me as an entity I

1021.06 --> 1029.77
disbelieved other individuality 'he's

1024.6 --> 1032.11
probably into my team's just couldn't

1029.77 --> 1035.56
see it I just couldn't just thought like

1032.11 --> 1038.1999999999998
everyone's NPC bought me I couldn't feel

1035.56 --> 1043.6
it I couldn't get there I've learned to

1038.2 --> 1047.19
do that all of that now and yeah they

1043.6 --> 1049.1499999999999
did try to ram me into that Marxist

1047.19 --> 1055.3300000000002
railroad to destruction

1049.15 --> 1060.39
and I was raised with very liberal

1055.33 --> 1063.8799999999999
left-wing yeah on the edge frolic II

1060.39 --> 1066.88
culture so they thought yeah this guy's

1063.88 --> 1070.0600000000002
perfect for it you might be a leader of

1066.88 --> 1072.88
the social justice oh you could be you

1070.06 --> 1076.4199999999998
could be the next Nancy Pelosi oh my god

1072.88 --> 1080.22
the honor oh I would love to be the next

1076.42 --> 1086.45
totally insane idiot that everyone hates

1080.22 --> 1090.46
that's just great no thank you so

1086.45 --> 1090.46
yeah I stepped away from all of it

1095.65 --> 1101.88
and don't forget to check about Skype

1098.52 --> 1101.8799999999999
I'm just

1101.93 --> 1107.8200000000002
in the middle of

1104.61 --> 1111.029
deep conversation if you want to be

1107.82 --> 1119.039
parts peanuts Clark if you want to be on

1111.029 --> 1121.86
the panel it's okay I'm open to kinds of

1119.039 --> 1124.559
things I don't really have a big story

1121.86 --> 1126.149
to put outside basically just rolling

1124.559 --> 1128.34
through sifting through all the

1126.149 --> 1132.33
materials and just seeing what comes out

1128.34 --> 1136.9189999999999
oh yeah also another realization that

1132.33 --> 1139.8799999999999
the tartarean vision stuff that story

1136.919 --> 1144.5590000000002
that interface story that I remember I

1139.88 --> 1144.5590000000002
don't think it was at my seventeen

1145.63 --> 1153.8500000000001
although it may have glimpsed at a

1149.26 --> 1157.33
moment there then - but the first time I

1153.85 --> 1164.6599999999999
was confronted with him it was probably

1157.33 --> 1166.6899999999998
when I was a lot younger and could it be

1164.66 --> 1170.499
there's something

1166.69 --> 1173.169
but it was so weird because it was with

1170.499 --> 1176.109
my mother I think my mother like when I

1173.169 --> 1179.679
was 8 attempted to tell me that story

1176.109 --> 1184.809
that occulted story of the Aryans and

1179.679 --> 1188.259
the way they were and allowed me at a

1184.809 --> 1192.519
very young age and basically already

1188.259 --> 1194.349
damaged so it was very fragile it was

1192.519 --> 1197.739
very foolish of her in retrospect

1194.349 --> 1200.769
confronted me with the marvels and the

1197.739 --> 1206.739
bitter bitter tragedy of the tartarean

1200.769 --> 1212.289
and I snapped I couldn't handle that of

1206.739 --> 1214.269
course I couldn't absolutely not and at

1212.289 --> 1216.309
one point yeah it's like oh yeah these

1214.269 --> 1219.659
are amazing people but on the other hand

1216.309 --> 1226.029
it's so terrifying and tragic and

1219.659 --> 1229.5990000000002
surreal away from what we now know as

1226.029 --> 1234.669
kind of the baseline human way of doing

1229.599 --> 1236.59
things did that it also terrified me so

1234.669 --> 1239.529
it had a two-faced response

1236.59 --> 1243.809
I loved the glory and was terrified

1239.529 --> 1248.14
about though the besides that are just

1243.809 --> 1251.53
not my own and I refuse to take

1248.14 --> 1255.5400000000002
like no I'm not gonna do that [ __ ]

1251.53 --> 1258.8799999999999
because I love you so much you know no I

1255.54 --> 1262.75
may be some kind of like far-fetched

1258.88 --> 1265.6000000000001
ascendant some cherry blossom I in me or

1262.75 --> 1268.87
whatever but that that way of doing

1265.6 --> 1272.11
things it's in the past that it's not

1268.87 --> 1277.51
gonna work anymore in my opinion not

1272.11 --> 1283.51
like that has to be different so I

1277.51 --> 1288.01
rejected it and I guess I guess that

1283.51 --> 1294.309
that could have been the moment when the

1288.01 --> 1296.35
dark side came for me because I I was

1294.309 --> 1300.6689999999999
basically open up to the door of the

1296.35 --> 1305.1999999999998
spiritual out there and since I walked

1300.669 --> 1308.0200000000002
away from that side another side used

1305.2 --> 1310.63
abused the opportunity to walk to me

1308.02 --> 1315.6399999999999
from the other side and started to now

1310.63 --> 1317.5300000000002
get involved in my in my nightmares and

1315.64 --> 1320.7990000000002
all this weird [ __ ] started to happen

1317.53 --> 1323.79
with the Jesuits and everything and the

1320.799 --> 1323.79
Flat Earth stuff

1327.23 --> 1330.76
my reality is weird

1341.75 --> 1350.15
but yeah I think that my mother a

1344.32 --> 1355.7
staunch believer and inspired lover of

1350.15 --> 1360.2900000000002
the Tartarian past she was much more

1355.7 --> 1364.72
like that much more passionate and like

1360.29 --> 1364.72
obsessed with art and music

1368.49 --> 1372.8
so I think she basically tried to

1372.91 --> 1384.8200000000002
follow that way and the Dark One's came

1378.91 --> 1388.03
after her she got cancer she got all

1384.82 --> 1393.25
weird Oh social justice warrior involved

1388.03 --> 1395.92
the extreme left East [ __ ] I don't even

1393.25 --> 1399.4
maybe she did even like stuff that I

1395.92 --> 1401.95
don't even want to know about because of

1399.4 --> 1407.17
these people she hung around with me

1401.95 --> 1413.68
extreme left and yet dang she turned

1407.17 --> 1415.78
into a troll went insane and died so

1413.68 --> 1419.97
thanks again for the dark side to

1415.78 --> 1419.97
completely ruin somebody

1434.19 --> 1437.3600000000001
and what it is

1439.89 --> 1446.179
you can hear me I can't hear you yeah

1446.6 --> 1449.6
yeah

1452.09 --> 1455.139
can you hear me

1457.38 --> 1468.47
getting up here we can you I am sorry

1461.49 --> 1468.47
about all that too when James AE sound

1469.99 --> 1481.72
new are well a peanuts what it is yeah I

1478.559 --> 1485.95
think I forgot to put up my volume again

1481.72 --> 1486.69
so up in low noise again sorry about

1485.95 --> 1489.73
that

1486.69 --> 1496.99
yeah there's there's also an echo I can

1489.73 --> 1500.919
hear myself there your speaker mmm yeah

1496.99 --> 1503.98
that's not my that's not supposed to be

1500.919 --> 1505.1490000000001
that's technical issue that's the case I

1503.98 --> 1508.75
can't help that

1505.149 --> 1511.899
okay only thing you can do is turn off

1508.75 --> 1515.649
the volume I try headphones to bypass

1511.899 --> 1517.899
them yeah anyway

1515.649 --> 1519.039
anyway we're off to a bad start man how

1517.899 --> 1522.33
was your weekend

1519.039 --> 1529.35
mm-hmm I said how was your weekend

1522.33 --> 1532.48
well my weekend was pretty okay good I

1529.35 --> 1535.4189999999999
stayed home yesterday I didn't feel good

1532.48 --> 1543.97
at all so today kind of feels like my

1535.419 --> 1546.5800000000002
Monday really I was I was listening to

1543.97 --> 1549.789
what you were you're talking about your

1546.58 --> 1554.49
mom while ago is that correct yeah it's

1549.789 --> 1557.95
I was basically - putting together

1554.49 --> 1561.01
pieces of my entire life and the other

1557.95 --> 1564.549
side experiences which my mom was

1561.01 --> 1569.289
definitely a part of in the beginning

1564.549 --> 1573.789
Wow I can't even I can't even get my mom

1569.289 --> 1579.339
to accept Kimbrough well we weren't

1573.789 --> 1580.089
dealing with any of that yet you know it

1579.339 --> 1584.729
wasn't there

1580.089 --> 1584.729
chemtrails only really started up in 95

1585.509 --> 1591.489
hmm my mom says she like she she'll give

1589.33 --> 1596.259
me a hug and she'll say dad you need to

1591.489 --> 1598.089
stop she's like they're just airplanes

1596.259 --> 1601.1490000000001
I'm like oh my god huh

1598.089 --> 1603.639
remember my mother wasn't like that but

1601.149 --> 1606.339
she would be very hurt by the

1603.639 --> 1609.879
realization of these things and that

1606.339 --> 1612.219
would make her want to forget but she

1609.879 --> 1616.4399999999998
wouldn't like flat out deny these things

1612.219 --> 1619.23
because yeah she did have good senses

1616.44 --> 1625.3500000000001
yeah

1619.23 --> 1627.51
yeah my um I tried to infer everybody

1625.35 --> 1631.32
listening uh that a bad thing you should

1627.51 --> 1633.93
do is talk about flutter or conspiracy

1631.32 --> 1637.62
theories any type of family gathering

1633.93 --> 1640.47
don't ever do that don't ever I wouldn't

1637.62 --> 1647.7299999999998
even talk about flutter that work but

1640.47 --> 1648.45
anyway my mom is a she's a civil

1647.73 --> 1655.4
engineer

1648.45 --> 1659.3400000000001
and she's actually a surveyor and and I

1655.4 --> 1661.71
I kind of asked her questions about you

1659.34 --> 1665.61
know the college that she went to and

1661.71 --> 1668.6100000000001
kind of what they taught her and she she

1665.61 --> 1672.2099999999998
was actually taught the eight inch per

1668.61 --> 1676.34
mile squared yeah and and so when she

1672.21 --> 1681.18
surveys she actually factors that in Wow

1676.34 --> 1687.51
so uh yeah she she totally think she

1681.18 --> 1690.8700000000001
don't her glove and it makes sense to me

1687.51 --> 1695.66
why a lot of people say that if you've

1690.87 --> 1699.27
gone through that that education system

1695.66 --> 1701.4
if you've had that then it's gonna be

1699.27 --> 1704.25
harder for that type of person to accept

1701.4 --> 1708.66
butter and worse I got a first-hand

1704.25 --> 1711.45
experience on why but it's everywhere

1708.66 --> 1715.53
it's the it's not just flat earth it's

1711.45 --> 1718.02
the complete replacement cosmology

1715.53 --> 1720.57
history everything everything is

1718.02 --> 1725.31
replaced with a lie and yeah there's

1720.57 --> 1728.1899999999998
entire careers based on these lies like

1725.31 --> 1732.69
certain branches of archaeology for

1728.19 --> 1736.74
example it's all based on reinforcing

1732.69 --> 1740.79
the fiction story to replace reality

1736.74 --> 1743.61
all of it and yet if you are part of

1740.79 --> 1746.04
this profession yet it's like just like

1743.61 --> 1749.03
oh yeah I am a professional astronomy

1746.04 --> 1751.92
I'm honored for my intelligence and the

1749.03 --> 1755.6399999999999
the philosophies I worked out but yeah

1751.92 --> 1758.3400000000001
it's all freaking fake you know and are

1755.64 --> 1763.71
these people gonna allow that to sink in

1758.34 --> 1766.6499999999999
I don't think so right and you know and

1763.71 --> 1771.1200000000001
I've overheard a lot of people ask you

1766.65 --> 1774.69
know is is is all of the astronomers

1771.12 --> 1778.4099999999999
lying you know and is all the teachers

1774.69 --> 1781.3700000000001
lying and I don't see it that that way I

1778.41 --> 1788.16
don't I don't see it as if they're lying

1781.37 --> 1791.33
I see it as if it's something that that

1788.16 --> 1794.13
they that was taught to them right and

1791.33 --> 1795.4499999999998
they're just following through what

1794.13 --> 1800.3090000000002
they've been taught all right therefore

1795.45 --> 1803.25
just perpetuating what they know so it

1800.309 --> 1805.17
but that only thing is it makes me think

1803.25 --> 1808.14
of more did this start

1805.17 --> 1813.38
you know I mean started with the

1808.14 --> 1813.38
designers of this system

1813.61 --> 1821.32
and then have it gradually put it into

1817.06 --> 1830.6699999999998
place in education and in all the

1821.32 --> 1834.79
institutions and just for an example the

1830.67 --> 1837.94
distance to the Sun it's it's changed so

1834.79 --> 1843.72
many times right yeah right yeah

1837.94 --> 1847.8400000000001
supposedly yeah supposedly right and

1843.72 --> 1852.04
being that that is it couldn't we call

1847.84 --> 1856.26
that theoretical science I guess no the

1852.04 --> 1861.8799999999999
entire thing the entire cosmos is all a

1856.26 --> 1863.95
presuppositional option it's all this

1861.88 --> 1867.2800000000002
giant thing that we worked out in utter

1863.95 --> 1869.98
detail we mapped out the entire galaxy

1867.28 --> 1873.8799999999999
based on the assumption that that is

1869.98 --> 1877.09
possible that's literally what it all is

1873.88 --> 1883.6000000000001
it's all based on the assumption that

1877.09 --> 1886.74
that is possible well all of it it's the

1883.6 --> 1890.4399999999998
one that one little stone that one

1886.74 --> 1894.82
pedestal that it's all resting on if

1890.44 --> 1902.05
it's possible and it's not they don't

1894.82 --> 1907.0
tell you that and I another thing is

1902.05 --> 1910.72
that I think most people most are want

1907.0 --> 1913.87
to be good right and I think that has

1910.72 --> 1917.95
been taken advantage of mmm-hmm does

1913.87 --> 1921.6399999999999
that make sense well wanting to be good

1917.95 --> 1924.28
is like a natural state of when you are

1921.64 --> 1927.6100000000001
balanced because hey if you're freaking

1924.28 --> 1929.47
hungry if there's a lot of people being

1927.61 --> 1932.08
very shitty around you yeah you don't

1929.47 --> 1933.55
want to be nice you don't want peace you

1932.08 --> 1937.58
want it to stop

1933.55 --> 1940.46
so being nice is in is

1937.58 --> 1944.99
natural state when things have found the

1940.46 --> 1947.0900000000001
balance so yeah

1944.99 --> 1952.16
it's both there it's all dependent on

1947.09 --> 1954.1699999999998
the entire scenario of things and one of

1952.16 --> 1959.5700000000002
the reasons why I kind of started

1954.17 --> 1962.14
thinking this is because it this is this

1959.57 --> 1964.76
topic has really changed the way that

1962.14 --> 1969.14
did I see things and then the way that I

1964.76 --> 1972.94
do things and even if you know like the

1969.14 --> 1976.1000000000001
other day I I was pulling out of

1972.94 --> 1979.28
somewhere and I was trying to hurry and

1976.1 --> 1981.26
get out of somebody's way and apparently

1979.28 --> 1983.54
you know I didn't get out of their way

1981.26 --> 1985.37
quick enough and they haunted me and

1983.54 --> 1988.19
flipped me off you know what I'm

1985.37 --> 1991.76
thinking damn that person is really on a

1988.19 --> 1995.51
globe you know what I mean like it makes

1991.76 --> 1999.02
you not really care about the next man

1995.51 --> 2000.61
and here lately night yeah here lately I

1999.02 --> 2002.41
excuse me go ahead go ahead

2000.61 --> 2004.06
no no no you make it you make a very

2002.41 --> 2006.67
good point it's one of the things that

2004.06 --> 2008.95
the globe religion does right it makes

2006.67 --> 2013.0
you stick to the image in your mind

2008.95 --> 2019.96
instead of reality right yeah I mean you

2013.0 --> 2022.95
in that fantasy world right and it's not

2019.96 --> 2029.74
like you buy reckless all these things

2022.95 --> 2031.57
typical correct and I don't really know

2029.74 --> 2034.93
how to explain it I'm trying to bring

2031.57 --> 2036.6399999999999
out words to explain the way I feel over

2034.93 --> 2039.91
these past four years because I think

2036.64 --> 2043.24
totally different I care about the

2039.91 --> 2045.88
people around me I care about my you

2043.24 --> 2050.35
know bitching neighbor you know and I

2045.88 --> 2055.03
don't care about him in a sense that you

2050.35 --> 2059.14
know I'll do anything for him but it

2055.03 --> 2061.7200000000003
does affect me you knowing that I don't

2059.14 --> 2065.47
live on a ball and it's change the way

2061.72 --> 2067.899
that I interact with people yep and I

2065.47 --> 2070.1299999999997
was just trying to Express

2067.899 --> 2071.8399999999997
you know a lot of people say we know

2070.13 --> 2072.79
what does it matter if it's flat what

2071.84 --> 2077.69
does it matter

2072.79 --> 2080.27
III have subjective evidence in myself

2077.69 --> 2084.23
to show that it's even changed the way

2080.27 --> 2086.6
that I treat other people it brings you

2084.23 --> 2089.78
down to earth literally and

2086.6 --> 2091.72
metaphorically because that outer space

2089.78 --> 2095.0600000000004
that infinite outer space makes us

2091.72 --> 2098.2599999999998
insignificant and if you think that has

2095.06 --> 2102.43
no influence on our being you are wrong

2098.26 --> 2107.7200000000003
it matters everything if this place is

2102.43 --> 2112.0099999999998
insignificant then if you accept that

2107.72 --> 2114.74
and don't defend against that like real

2112.01 --> 2116.84
life false realization then nothing

2114.74 --> 2119.0299999999997
matters and you can just destroy the

2116.84 --> 2121.76
freaking planet and just leave on that

2119.03 --> 2124.46
spaceship to another world it doesn't

2121.76 --> 2126.6200000000003
matter if you're reckless because it's

2124.46 --> 2130.13
all insignificant but with the Flat

2126.62 --> 2132.5899999999997
Earth and the taking away of the

2130.13 --> 2135.62
infinite space that all goes away

2132.59 --> 2139.58
because suddenly it's very confined and

2135.62 --> 2142.58
defined and there is like a number now

2139.58 --> 2145.22
of things in existence and of spirits in

2142.58 --> 2147.11
existence you can now start actually

2145.22 --> 2149.06
counting it's no longer we're no longer

2147.11 --> 2152.06
just a bunch of bacterias on a little

2149.06 --> 2154.79
sphere in an infinity no we are now

2152.06 --> 2159.17
suddenly really the entities that we are

2154.79 --> 2160.7599999999998
in the set scale of things and that

2159.17 --> 2166.89
makes everything significant and it

2160.76 --> 2170.13
strengthens our spirit this realization

2166.89 --> 2172.3799999999997
and I know I know you may not want to

2170.13 --> 2176.82
talk about it but I did want to bring it

2172.38 --> 2180.5
up just a little bit and I don't agree

2176.82 --> 2184.86
with you but I kind of understand why

2180.5 --> 2187.34
when Jose did that on your show I kind

2184.86 --> 2191.31
of understand why that upset you because

2187.34 --> 2195.9900000000002
everything that I just said that is what

2191.31 --> 2202.44
Jose is going Akins if he says that it's

2195.99 --> 2204.66
a ball right is that is that nothing I

2202.44 --> 2208.05
said well it is so much more than just

2204.66 --> 2209.91
it's visible on the surface the problem

2208.05 --> 2212.79
is we have two ball symptoms and

2209.91 --> 2215.0099999999998
everything in the typical behaviors but

2212.79 --> 2218.7
these subtle energies that come with

2215.01 --> 2220.7700000000004
that the irresponsibility that comes

2218.7 --> 2223.62
with it that is seated in the spirit

2220.77 --> 2225.45
that's not that obvious you have to

2223.62 --> 2227.73
figure that out that it actually works

2225.45 --> 2232.8599999999997
that way by studying people that are so

2227.73 --> 2234.9
deeply in this the regression of being

2232.86 --> 2236.58
in that mode and I talked to Jose about

2234.9 --> 2238.9500000000003
it like yeah you think now it's all

2236.58 --> 2241.47
right you know also such a relief not

2238.95 --> 2244.9199999999996
having to care and just being free but

2241.47 --> 2249.99
that's only for a short moment because

2244.92 --> 2254.01
after that the changes come it it's what

2249.99 --> 2256.4599999999996
happens when you let I'll just call him

2254.01 --> 2260.19
Satan put a hole in your consciousness

2256.46 --> 2263.15
when you actively allow a lie in your

2260.19 --> 2265.8
spirit knowingly that is what that is

2263.15 --> 2268.37
you allow him to mutilate you

2265.8 --> 2271.59
spiritually that is what that is and

2268.37 --> 2274.14
then you get the whole and then the

2271.59 --> 2280.1600000000003
spirit no longer grows naturally because

2274.14 --> 2282.62
it's damaged you know

2280.16 --> 2287.24
when you damage a tree when it's very

2282.62 --> 2291.44
young it if it survives then how it

2287.24 --> 2294.2599999999998
grows will be entirely sent rated around

2291.44 --> 2298.03
the damaged spots that damage spots

2294.26 --> 2300.1400000000003
gonna be absolutely visible absolutely

2298.03 --> 2303.05
noticeable for the rest of that trees

2300.14 --> 2306.23
life you will always see where and how

2303.05 --> 2309.65
it was damaged and how it overcame that

2306.23 --> 2311.96
group or through that and the spirit is

2309.65 --> 2316.34
very similar if you allow holes in there

2311.96 --> 2322.37
the damage will show and it will change

2316.34 --> 2327.46
the way everything grows that's just how

2322.37 --> 2330.29
I see that right yeah I understand and

2327.46 --> 2335.12
in a way it kind of made me mad too

2330.29 --> 2336.5299999999997
because I mean go watch that you know

2335.12 --> 2339.47
I'm not telling you to do this but I'm

2336.53 --> 2343.55
just saying you know the last 30 flag

2339.47 --> 2347.6899999999996
debate shows on Nathan you know I I see

2343.55 --> 2351.38
a flat earther defending flutter yeah

2347.69 --> 2356.12
and a lot of energy yeah and I really I

2351.38 --> 2358.79
I took it I believed it I could say me

2356.12 --> 2361.7
too and that's what hurt me I don't give

2358.79 --> 2363.77
a [ __ ] if he's a globe or a flattered or

2361.7 --> 2365.5699999999997
whatever or if he's just a nutcase I

2363.77 --> 2369.53
don't give a [ __ ] it's not about them

2365.57 --> 2374.9500000000003
it's about that friendship thing that

2369.53 --> 2378.86
connection that's what hurt me

2374.95 --> 2382.1
you know I guess I said about some guy

2378.86 --> 2384.56
thinking that the globe is real welcome

2382.1 --> 2387.65
to the club welcome to the troll club

2384.56 --> 2390.44
there are thousands of these okay it

2387.65 --> 2398.48
doesn't matter it's about how you did it

2390.44 --> 2401.0
and I'm getting over it yeah I know I

2398.48 --> 2406.37
didn't forgive me for bringing it up I

2401.0 --> 2408.46
just it's okay it's still I can't I

2406.37 --> 2411.64
can't really process it because it's

2408.46 --> 2417.77
when I first started hearing Jose I

2411.64 --> 2421.3399999999997
thought he was kind of kind of flip-flop

2417.77 --> 2423.98
kind of you know because he would always

2421.34 --> 2425.57
kind of the end with the ballers and

2423.98 --> 2429.11
then and then he would come chitchat

2425.57 --> 2431.4500000000003
with us and then I kind of I kind of had

2429.11 --> 2434.6
my guard up against him but after a

2431.45 --> 2438.08
while my I let it I let it down and I I

2434.6 --> 2441.29
considered him as a flatterers plotters

2438.08 --> 2444.43
there and I considered him as somebody

2441.29 --> 2448.39
who wants to promote this and wants to

2444.43 --> 2451.2799999999997
people to know that you know you're

2448.39 --> 2456.2599999999998
we're on we're in something very very

2451.28 --> 2458.42
very special here and I when he did that

2456.26 --> 2463.01
it felt like he threw all that away

2458.42 --> 2466.53
exactly exactly it's how you felt it too

2463.01 --> 2470.73
I guess

2466.53 --> 2472.8
I did and you know you know Anthony's

2470.73 --> 2474.36
telling people you know don't don't give

2472.8 --> 2478.53
him [ __ ] don't give him [ __ ] and I'm

2474.36 --> 2480.81
like I once I'm not yeah I'm like I

2478.53 --> 2482.6400000000003
don't want to give him [ __ ] you know

2480.81 --> 2483.45
we're gonna have to pretend like nothing

2482.64 --> 2487.25
ever happened

2483.45 --> 2493.02
yeah it's okay to do that it's okay just

2487.25 --> 2494.67
just have emergency spiritual surgery on

2493.02 --> 2498.24
your soul is that just okay is that

2494.67 --> 2499.8
normal to have somebody you're going

2498.24 --> 2503.9399999999996
through a spiritual journey with

2499.8 --> 2505.98
suddenly betrayed that journey right in

2503.94 --> 2511.05
between you you know you know what

2505.98 --> 2514.11
really bugged me in the mouth on on

2511.05 --> 2518.9300000000003
Nathan's show there was a few a few

2514.11 --> 2523.8
clips where Jose did the perspective

2518.93 --> 2528.4199999999996
observation in a grocery store and that

2523.8 --> 2532.13
had let me know that he was 100% aware

2528.42 --> 2535.14
of how our eyes work right you got it

2532.13 --> 2538.05
yeah there and now he doesn't get it

2535.14 --> 2541.73
anymore he literally became mentally and

2538.05 --> 2545.25
kneecaps and he did it to himself

2541.73 --> 2548.1
spiritual surgery it's psycho it's

2545.25 --> 2551.43
psychotic only a maniac will do that

2548.1 --> 2558.3199999999997
it's almost like committing suicide but

2551.43 --> 2558.3199999999997
not on the physical level it's so freaky

2560.68 --> 2563.3689999999997
this

2564.21 --> 2569.52
and I think that's why I'm having a

2567.329 --> 2573.4500000000003
difficult time I mean it's not like it's

2569.52 --> 2576.66
bothered me my day or anything but every

2573.45 --> 2579.02
time I hear him basically prove that he

2576.66 --> 2581.3689999999997
doesn't get it anymore now that's just

2579.02 --> 2585.9
nauseating to me every single time no

2581.369 --> 2589.4100000000003
it's you know I'd rather hear didn't do

2585.9 --> 2592.02
that same thing because he never got it

2589.41 --> 2595.8289999999997
and he probably will over God get it and

2592.02 --> 2598.98
that's kind of like sad but yeah it is

2595.829 --> 2604.94
his freakin thing Jose actually did get

2598.98 --> 2604.94
it and now I lost it my god

2608.4 --> 2616.559
he I yeah he actually called in to Jared

2612.39 --> 2620.339
show last night and now is he yeah but

2616.559 --> 2623.849
he called him at the end so they kind of

2620.339 --> 2626.67
he had to hang up on him but you know it

2623.849 --> 2629.789
was Jaron obviously had heard somebody

2626.67 --> 2632.509
had told him but Jaron actually asked

2629.789 --> 2636.029
him he was like he was like so you've

2632.509 --> 2640.339
you're back on the ball now and Jose was

2636.029 --> 2645.329
like well I've had a change of heart and

2640.339 --> 2648.42
I'm sorry but you know personal reasons

2645.329 --> 2651.989
is not scientific evidence I'm sorry

2648.42 --> 2655.259
it's not yeah that's it makes no sense

2651.989 --> 2656.88
if he had trouble then just walk away I

2655.259 --> 2658.099
told him I'm like why didn't you just

2656.88 --> 2662.099
walk away

2658.099 --> 2664.829
enjoy your surroundings make some video

2662.099 --> 2667.9500000000003
and don't think about it don't don't

2664.829 --> 2670.619
force yourself to draw conclusion again

2667.95 --> 2674.729
if it's so burdensome just walk away do

2670.619 --> 2680.1600000000003
it don't think about it and stop being

2674.729 --> 2681.93
in this in this place where there is so

2680.16 --> 2683.969
much pressure all the time if that

2681.93 --> 2686.0989999999997
pressure is killing you and I really

2683.969 --> 2689.4
switched you let it the pressure

2686.099 --> 2691.349
corrupted you didn't walk away to let it

2689.4 --> 2693.779
die down so he could come to his senses

2691.349 --> 2696.289
no he let the pressure corrupt him

2693.779 --> 2701.219
because he refused to walk away how

2696.289 --> 2706.1400000000003

2808.15 --> 2813.01
that's it's really really storming it's

2811.42 --> 2816.13
no storming out there because evening

2813.01 --> 2818.86
the road which has cars driving over it

2816.13 --> 2824.17
rectally even that thing just keeps on

2818.86 --> 2826.65
being snowy I'm glad that I got all my

2824.17 --> 2826.65
food

2830.24 --> 2835.27
and outside in this weather on a bike is

2832.52 --> 2835.27
kind of a chore

2856.72 --> 2861.4599999999996
no one always is kind of weird about the

2859.48 --> 2867.599
whole thing when I get like really

2861.46 --> 2867.599
violently ill and my spirit is like

2867.82 --> 2872.29
hormonal system as a responsible panic

2870.55 --> 2874.3
all that it is Lyra literally like when

2872.29 --> 2878.35
I get that sick my entire system just

2874.3 --> 2882.3100000000004
goes into alarm mode into physiological

2878.35 --> 2883.18
panic but every time that happens

2882.31 --> 2887.57
afterward it

2883.18 --> 2890.44
I feel cleansed

2887.57 --> 2890.44
isn't that on

2890.49 --> 2893.9599999999996
it is almost like

2894.28 --> 2900.67
when you are physically sick you have a

2897.64 --> 2902.83
very bad cold or whatever now you go

2900.67 --> 2906.34
through this metabolic cleanup process

2902.83 --> 2910.93
basically that's what it is and then

2906.34 --> 2913.9900000000002
afterward you feel fresh suddenly you

2910.93 --> 2916.0
see clear you smell clear well it was

2913.99 --> 2918.7
all ears first was dimmed down and

2916.0 --> 2922.57
confusing and and then suddenly you're

2918.7 --> 2926.109
clearer than before when you than before

2922.57 --> 2928.51
when you became ill and this is kind of

2926.109 --> 2932.7
the same like yeah I've been squeezed

2928.51 --> 2937.3900000000003
like a freaking lemon okay totally

2932.7 --> 2940.33
mangled but afterward now I feel almost

2937.39 --> 2944.97
like I had like a very heavy sporty

2940.33 --> 2948.24
esporting day and it kind of feels good

2944.97 --> 2952.95
still like my stomach is still little

2948.24 --> 2952.95
yeah let's not go pounding them

2956.74 --> 2968.29
there are hey welcome back yeah anyway

2964.54 --> 2972.46
man I I just wanted to let you know that

2968.29 --> 2974.05
I kind of can relate you know to the way

2972.46 --> 2978.609
you feel the way it made you feel

2974.05 --> 2987.3900000000003
and I'm imagine just imagine how Jun

2978.609 --> 2987.39
sniffles I wait what do you mean

2988.29 --> 2993.64
think about it dude

2990.099 --> 2997.63
I don't know

2993.64 --> 3000.45
well what context sorry well I mean so

2997.63 --> 3002.04
you know Jared obviously thought it the

3000.45 --> 3005.5499999999997
same as we did we thought he was

3002.04 --> 3008.099
aflutter you know so nice about the who

3005.55 --> 3010.53
say you mean you're right you know and

3008.099 --> 3014.849
you know he was gifted you know that

3010.53 --> 3017.73
camera which it is it was gifted to it

3014.849 --> 3020.19
you know and and what they do with that

3017.73 --> 3024.2400000000002
camera that's that's really between Jose

3020.19 --> 3026.88
and Jaron really I know where Anthony is

3024.24 --> 3027.5989999999997
saying some things but it's really none

3026.88 --> 3030.059
of our business

3027.599 --> 3034.8900000000003
well you know you know the issue with

3030.059 --> 3037.5890000000004
her the weird weird issue is is yeah we

3034.89 --> 3039.569
could from our perspective consider that

3037.589 --> 3043.5589999999997
ours I basically had a mental breakdown

3039.569 --> 3048.0589999999997
it seems very similar to that very well

3043.559 --> 3051.02
covered up by him so she but yeah he's

3048.059 --> 3055.4100000000003
still making that great footage he just

3051.02 --> 3057.54
turned insane over what he's doing

3055.41 --> 3060.74
really like but he still does the same

3057.54 --> 3063.869
thing he still brings he will bring on

3060.74 --> 3066.27
magnificent proofs for the flat earth

3063.869 --> 3068.67
but he just can't see it anymore

3066.27 --> 3072.42
and maybe he even knows it it's like oh

3068.67 --> 3075.0
this is worth gold but I chose the globe

3072.42 --> 3076.14
and I don't understand really what I'm

3075.0 --> 3078.119
seeing anymore but it's really

3076.14 --> 3080.64
interesting and I'll just keep on going

3078.119 --> 3082.319
because everyone appreciates it so yeah

3080.64 --> 3084.17
he turned insane but he's still doing

3082.319 --> 3089.04
good stuff with that camera

3084.17 --> 3092.04
that's it like what what's the worst he

3089.04 --> 3097.73
could do you could stop stop doing that

3092.04 --> 3102.29
stop filming and just do nothing

3097.73 --> 3105.7400000000002
well I uh I did I did go unsub from his

3102.29 --> 3112.569
channel because I I don't he goes

3105.74 --> 3114.7099999999996
against everything that I promote and

3112.569 --> 3117.2599999999998
you know that's that's just we're on

3114.71 --> 3118.7
that with it he you know he's he I don't

3117.26 --> 3124.579
really know the guy I've already spoke

3118.7 --> 3128.0789999999997
so cute on but how just like ISA says

3124.579 --> 3130.94
you know how dare you use an optical

3128.079 --> 3136.6600000000003
phenomenon to determine the shape of the

3130.94 --> 3136.66
earth how dare you you know

3139.07 --> 3148.52
or you can get some geometrical

3142.4 --> 3151.9700000000003
deductions there about yeah that's right

3148.52 --> 3154.97
but I mean if I can't see I think I know

3151.97 --> 3158.0
what you mean it is basically like it's

3154.97 --> 3160.73
an obstruction you assume its curvature

3158.0 --> 3163.07
and that's that no further no more

3160.73 --> 3166.73
thinking required you got the solution

3163.07 --> 3169.25
that's basically it all right see

3166.73 --> 3172.52
something and used two ends like and

3169.25 --> 3175.4
this is what it is and stop thinking

3172.52 --> 3177.71
about it that's the effect its curvature

3175.4 --> 3179.51
yeah it doesn't make any sense how it

3177.71 --> 3182.9
looks with the other things there

3179.51 --> 3187.67
it's curvature just that's it no more

3182.9 --> 3190.34
thinking about it right they do and in

3187.67 --> 3194.1800000000003
the in the 90s

3190.34 --> 3197.0
Bill Nye he he really really he really

3194.18 --> 3200.45
got a lot of us on that boats going over

3197.0 --> 3204.71
the over the curvature that really got a

3200.45 --> 3207.95
lot of people absolutely it was the

3204.71 --> 3209.81
start of the this mecca nation apparatus

3207.95 --> 3216.7
that the globus now have mastered

3209.81 --> 3220.869
themselves right in its

3216.7 --> 3222.9399999999996
you know as me as a flutter there I I

3220.869 --> 3224.799
can't I can't

3222.94 --> 3228.2200000000003
combat somebody's argument with

3224.799 --> 3231.43
something that a heliocentric priest

3228.22 --> 3233.6189999999997
says you know just like you no no

3231.43 --> 3237.24
deGrasse Tyson says you know that stuff

3233.619 --> 3240.579
is flat you know what I mean if if I'm

3237.24 --> 3243.49
going against what they are saying I

3240.579 --> 3248.619
can't use what they're saying as my

3243.49 --> 3251.6499999999996
evidence you should assume maybe I

3248.619 --> 3256.9900000000002
didn't say that right little confusing

3251.65 --> 3259.9
yeah okay so okay so look let's say

3256.99 --> 3263.74
let's say that that I show you a clip

3259.9 --> 3266.76
that says that hold on a second

3263.74 --> 3266.7599999999998
somebody's not gonna Markkula

3271.6 --> 3278.98
are you there yeah okay so it might show

3275.56 --> 3281.68
you a clip showing showing the little

3278.98 --> 3284.71
fake astronauts in the ISS you know

3281.68 --> 3287.7999999999997
saying that as far as we can go as low

3284.71 --> 3290.23
Earth orbit right if I show that to you

3287.8 --> 3293.53
and I say look they can't leave the

3290.23 --> 3296.86
Earth's orbit but me as a flat earther I

3293.53 --> 3299.53
don't believe anything NASA said so why

3296.86 --> 3302.1600000000003
would I use something that they say as

3299.53 --> 3307.0
my evidence that's brilliant that's

3302.16 --> 3309.6099999999997
really an yeah you're right I can't do

3307.0 --> 3310.48
it it's just like it's just like I still

3309.61 --> 3313.09
here today

3310.48 --> 3317.23
I hear flat earthers using the word

3313.09 --> 3319.7200000000003
buoyancy and I'm like no don't say that

3317.23 --> 3324.34
when you say buoyancy you are emitting

3319.72 --> 3329.7999999999997
little G you are emitting to do not say

3324.34 --> 3333.9700000000003
buoyancy it is weird

3329.8 --> 3336.82
yeah but that's the whole I think

3333.97 --> 3340.62
there's an issue with NASA in general

3336.82 --> 3344.77
and that is yeah they obviously do

3340.62 --> 3347.3399999999997
fakery and they do lies but I think that

3344.77 --> 3350.44
they also here and there tell some truth

3347.34 --> 3354.1600000000003
and I think they're doing it as a thumb

3350.44 --> 3358.84
of rule a rule of thumb like they have

3354.16 --> 3360.73
to give some truth out there even if it

3358.84 --> 3362.8
doesn't actually fit the entire

3360.73 --> 3364.69
overarching picture they're trying to

3362.8 --> 3367.27
share with everyone

3364.69 --> 3372.55
because they have to do it they have to

3367.27 --> 3375.1
be like they have to anchor that dream

3372.55 --> 3377.53
in the in the earth it's like that giant

3375.1 --> 3380.5
dream they're weaving if there's no

3377.53 --> 3385.0
anchors in the earth then it's just

3380.5 --> 3387.4
gonna disintegrate it won't maintain any

3385.0 --> 3390.55
strength it has to have some truth

3387.4 --> 3393.07
somewhere in it has to be proof that

3390.55 --> 3394.09
there are some truthful things happening

3393.07 --> 3398.3900000000003
at all

3394.09 --> 3400.4900000000002
and I don't know with when it comes to

3398.39 --> 3402.7999999999997
truth and lies I think that it is an art

3400.49 --> 3407.5099999999998
to basically distinguish what is true

3402.8 --> 3411.2000000000003
and what is lies by the essence of it in

3407.51 --> 3414.17
itself and not judging based on the

3411.2 --> 3417.79
people that share it like a liar can

3414.17 --> 3421.7000000000003
share the truth knowingly unknowingly

3417.79 --> 3425.0
the thing is it doesn't matter really

3421.7 --> 3429.02
who share it it is what is shared is

3425.0 --> 3433.67
that the truth or is it not and how can

3429.02 --> 3436.67
you know through the essence of how it's

3433.67 --> 3439.2200000000003
shared and through the gathered

3436.67 --> 3444.17
knowledge and basically putting it all

3439.22 --> 3447.47
together is this true or is it false and

3444.17 --> 3451.2200000000003
that's the only real way to to be truly

3447.47 --> 3453.08
certain because she just can never trust

3451.22 --> 3456.2
your information blindly on any

3453.08 --> 3459.56
individual or any book you can only

3456.2 --> 3462.7599999999998
determine if it is true from the inside

3459.56 --> 3465.16
I believe

3462.76 --> 3470.92
and they only get some tea right now so

3465.16 --> 3473.47
that's good yeah man I'm uh I'm actually

3470.92 --> 3475.56
about to head to work I just wanted to

3473.47 --> 3481.72
come on he's still here me

3475.56 --> 3485.44
no you're gone anyway

3481.72 --> 3488.6499999999996
I don't know I've always kind of

3485.44 --> 3493.27
wondered you know someone asked me one

3488.65 --> 3497.08
day they said they said what if what if

3493.27 --> 3505.03
you found out that NASA rolled out

3497.08 --> 3507.42
flatter what would you do it had me

3505.03 --> 3507.42
trigger

3508.51 --> 3531.73
I don't know what I would do I was just

3526.05 --> 3535.4500000000003
but someone asked me a nine father asked

3531.73 --> 3536.079
me a long time ago they said what would

3535.45 --> 3539.0789999999997
you do

3536.079 --> 3548.1400000000003
or what would you think if you found out

3539.079 --> 3550.51
that NASA rolled out flat earth and I

3548.14 --> 3551.74
don't know I don't know what I don't

3550.51 --> 3557.8900000000003
know I don't know what that would do to

3551.74 --> 3563.97
me rolled it out rolled out row well the

3557.89 --> 3568.3289999999997
the specific ID model the idea no oh

3563.97 --> 3572.5
maybe they did maybe NASA indeed gave us

3568.329 --> 3575.4700000000003
the fish boil the fishbowl again seems

3572.5 --> 3578.859
to be the thing that's shaft in from all

3575.47 --> 3582.7599999999998
directions so maybe they did that maybe

3578.859 --> 3585.819
they gave us this false paradigm because

3582.76 --> 3589.75
maybe it is more because that model kind

3585.819 --> 3593.319
of excludes more land all that and yeah

3589.75 --> 3595.829
my model as you can clearly see in the

3593.319 --> 3595.829
Hangout itself

3602.01 --> 3613.8
we could hear that but yeah who knows

3608.28 --> 3617.9100000000003
maybe NASA did roll out a form of Flat

3613.8 --> 3621.51
Earth as an attempt to control the

3617.91 --> 3624.2999999999997
awakening and give it boundaries little

3621.51 --> 3627.119
literal physical boundaries in the form

3624.3 --> 3631.53
of a dome that we have to assume is

3627.119 --> 3633.7400000000002
there another presupposition not a

3631.53 --> 3636.8390000000004
presupposition we have to rest on

3633.74 --> 3639.589
because yeah are you are you gonna be

3636.839 --> 3642.81
allowed to touch that dome you know

3639.589 --> 3644.5499999999997
because the more I think about it the

3642.81 --> 3648.18
more I think it's not there and it is

3644.55 --> 3652.67
actually a surreal looping spatially

3648.18 --> 3652.6699999999996
irregular world

3654.35 --> 3663.71
and why do I think that because no body

3660.46 --> 3668.2400000000002
talks about it except me

3663.71 --> 3674.23
there is no touching upon it from any

3668.24 --> 3677.24
higher of media that I've seen ever ever

3674.23 --> 3679.7
well there's no globe thingy

3677.24 --> 3680.24
yeah that's popping up all over the

3679.7 --> 3685.72
place

3680.24 --> 3690.04
gloat here but it's getting there

3685.72 --> 3694.7
rectangular looping a domeless world

3690.04 --> 3697.93
spatial non-linearity never never never

3694.7 --> 3705.9199999999996
seen that outside of my own hangouts and

3697.93 --> 3710.39
free and energy and those folk it's

3705.92 --> 3713.7200000000003
never it's never even entertained by a

3710.39 --> 3717.14
mainstream source never even entertained

3713.72 --> 3721.97
it's always oh Flat Earth oh so crazy

3717.14 --> 3725.5699999999997
but look they believe in the dome worlds

3721.97 --> 3730.5499999999997
right a flat disc with the dome that's

3725.57 --> 3733.3700000000003
every time Flat Earth is touching more

3730.55 --> 3736.46
wide media it's always that it's the

3733.37 --> 3740.21
only thing the only only only only thing

3736.46 --> 3743.09
you will ever see never any other

3740.21 --> 3743.9900000000002
options never even suggested that they

3743.09 --> 3748.3
could exist

3743.99 --> 3750.5299999999997
it's only that that the dough disc

3748.3 --> 3753.02
versus the globe that's the battle

3750.53 --> 3755.4500000000003
that's the paradigm that's what you have

3753.02 --> 3758.39
to choose between there is nothing else

3755.45 --> 3763.73
according to the wider media nothing

3758.39 --> 3767.02
else yeah yeah you got a sec could be

3763.73 --> 3772.5
the the ones that are putting it there

3767.02 --> 3778.99
as a controlled opposition

3772.5 --> 3784.81
migration a cultural migration because

3778.99 --> 3788.14
the globe is yeah it's it's probably

3784.81 --> 3792.13
pragmatic because yeah the globe is kind

3788.14 --> 3795.5099999999998
of a mess and will wreak heaven if left

3792.13 --> 3801.369
in its place long enough the culture

3795.51 --> 3803.9500000000003
allows that to happen yeah

3801.369 --> 3806.349
yeah I mean look the globe hasn't

3803.95 --> 3809.2889999999998
exactly softened people up okay

3806.349 --> 3811.299
right like thee there has to be active

3809.289 --> 3813.579
messages like come on we have to protect

3811.299 --> 3814.69
their blood and it's like it doesn't

3813.579 --> 3818.38
touch anymore

3814.69 --> 3820.989
because everybody's like no it is well

3818.38 --> 3823.239
if I'd say all these things in the

3820.989 --> 3825.46
context of any type of Flat Earth I

3823.239 --> 3829.39
think the response would be very

3825.46 --> 3832.39
different because yeah you literally are

3829.39 --> 3836.44
here in this confined space you could

3832.39 --> 3838.5989999999997
call it a cage or maybe not a cage but a

3836.44 --> 3841.329
limited space and we are together and

3838.599 --> 3844.119
yeah it is our task to make it all

3841.329 --> 3847.17
survive and it is the only thing here so

3844.119 --> 3851.049
there's no [ __ ] to distract you

3847.17 --> 3854.2290000000003
this is what we got to do this is the

3851.049 --> 3857.729
only sensible thing to do is to be the

3854.229 --> 3857.729
caretakers in this world

3860.34 --> 3866.09
and the globe doesn't do that just does

3863.55 --> 3869.7000000000003
it I think every time even

3866.09 --> 3872.3700000000003
environmentalism and the globe I think

3869.7 --> 3876.1499999999996
that most people just look at the the

3872.37 --> 3878.13
globe CGI and just think oh yeah it's so

3876.15 --> 3880.9500000000003
doomed yeah I can't wait until we all

3878.13 --> 3882.48
leave to another planet they're just

3880.95 --> 3885.18
gonna do that in their mind because they

3882.48 --> 3887.34
don't want to care about the world

3885.18 --> 3889.3199999999997
because it's insignificant it's just a

3887.34 --> 3890.2200000000003
freakin little dot in an endless

3889.32 --> 3892.02
universe

3890.22 --> 3895.5
who cares who gives a [ __ ] about that

3892.02 --> 3897.42
place you know when there's infinite

3895.5 --> 3899.94
possibilities out there who gives a [ __ ]

3897.42 --> 3902.7000000000003
about Earth when there's infinite room

3899.94 --> 3906.9900000000002
out there and that's just a

3902.7 --> 3912.6899999999996
psychological effect of it it's what

3906.99 --> 3924.0
people will end up with in their minds

3912.69 --> 3927.21
in their souls no you're right and

3924.0 --> 3929.58
that's that's actually a good answer to

3927.21 --> 3931.11
you know a lot of people ask you what

3929.58 --> 3932.94
does it matter what because that's kind

3931.11 --> 3935.9700000000003
of what I thought at first you know my

3932.94 --> 3936.54
first second year I was like okay well I

3935.97 --> 3942.6
didn't matter

3936.54 --> 3945.42
and of course as I've had time to digest

3942.6 --> 3950.13
this and had time to think about it a

3945.42 --> 3952.38
lot it does change the way that I that I

3950.13 --> 3958.01
think and the and little things that I

3952.38 --> 3962.31
do like this may sound kind of weird but

3958.01 --> 3965.67
I don't even want to kill a bug like

3962.31 --> 3968.7
it's weird and leather unless I don't

3965.67 --> 3971.85
kill notes done that's different I will

3968.7 --> 3974.5499999999997
say this if there's a spider in my

3971.85 --> 3978.18
bathtub I'm sorry I gotta kill it yeah

3974.55 --> 3981.3900000000003
oh I got to know you're gonna rescue it

3978.18 --> 3982.1699999999996
no yeah you just pick it up put it

3981.39 --> 3984.99
somewhere else

3982.17 --> 3988.369
spiders are invaluable they actually

3984.99 --> 3991.7099999999996
take away the shitty insects

3988.369 --> 3994.05
but the only reason I said that is

3991.71 --> 3996.33
because I'm I'm trying to make a point

3994.05 --> 4000.02
to relate to where I came from

3996.33 --> 4002.81
yeah when I was when I was younger I was

4000.02 --> 4003.59
I mean during during the seasons that we

4002.81 --> 4006.38
could huh

4003.59 --> 4010.79
I was always hard it never bothered me

4006.38 --> 4016.79
to kill a deer a pig a coyote or

4010.79 --> 4019.73
anything like that now I could never I

4016.79 --> 4022.91
could never kill one of it never right

4019.73 --> 4025.67
because you feel more right your senses

4022.91 --> 4027.6499999999996
are open now you suddenly can't ignore

4025.67 --> 4030.73
that they really are being with the

4027.65 --> 4030.73
spirit anymore

4033.53 --> 4041.21
and that's I know that's subjective and

4036.83 --> 4042.56
it's just my personal view on it but

4041.21 --> 4045.19
it's nothing you're not the only one

4042.56 --> 4045.19
trust me

4052.14 --> 4056.44

4171.299 --> 4177.089
hope they're they're kind of interesting

4173.549 --> 4179.249
I had like the first advertisement that

4177.089 --> 4182.8189999999995
I bumped into on my own channel was like

4179.249 --> 4184.559
a shaman in the Native American shaman

4182.819 --> 4187.589000000001
there was like really funny to see that

4184.559 --> 4190.17
pop up on yesterday's hangout at the

4187.589 --> 4191.849
beginning and the end it's like oh yeah

4190.17 --> 4193.859
I guess it's kind of fitting I am

4191.849 --> 4195.869000000001
talking about the original Native

4193.859 --> 4200.249000000001
Americans and I were talking about the

4195.869 --> 4203.369
shaman figure and all that so I guess it

4200.249 --> 4205.26
just thought you know what Shyama Native

4203.369 --> 4207.15
American okay that just put this Native

4205.26 --> 4210.2300000000005
American shaman advertisement in there

4207.15 --> 4217.219
