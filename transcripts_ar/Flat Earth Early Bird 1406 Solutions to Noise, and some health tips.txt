117.299 --> 121.2
great

119.46 --> 123.24
all right

121.2 --> 126.86
so whether

123.24 --> 126.86
changed a bit

128.22 --> 132.66
there is more sun

130.5 --> 135.18
clouds are less thick but there's now

132.66 --> 138.06
there's just this

135.18 --> 140.22
sheep cloud

138.06 --> 144.2
covering

140.22 --> 144.2
looks really cute though but

144.54 --> 149.12
and plenty of Sun still coming through

146.819 --> 149.11999999999998
that

154.32 --> 158.76
[Music]

155.4 --> 160.56
yeah and yesterday there was no storm

158.76 --> 161.34
which I did not expect

160.56 --> 164.4
foreign

161.34 --> 166.68
because it really did seem

164.4 --> 168.66
the sudden temperature increased that it

166.68 --> 172.28
might storm

168.66 --> 172.28
lightning and all that but it didn't

172.68 --> 175.28
ah

175.379 --> 180.739
low Elise G good to see you first in

178.379 --> 180.739
chat

181.319 --> 187.01899999999998
right so yeah I'm a little wonky

184.44 --> 188.94
because I don't know lots of people

187.019 --> 190.14000000000001
yesterday thought that it was party time

188.94 --> 193.26
and

190.14 --> 196.61999999999998
literally kept I actually got to the

193.26 --> 199.98
point where I called the police

196.62 --> 202.98000000000002
because it was like past four

199.98 --> 204.54
and there was some I don't know it must

202.98 --> 206.879
have been like a druggie because he'd

204.54 --> 209.76
been sitting there for hours and hours

206.879 --> 213.0
like three hours at least

209.76 --> 215.76
just playing damn music in his car

213.0 --> 220.4
really loud

215.76 --> 220.39999999999998
and like super distractive music

220.5 --> 224.76
just

221.94 --> 228.06
incredibly annoying

224.76 --> 229.67999999999998
and yeah so like not all that rested

228.06 --> 232.099
today

229.68 --> 232.09900000000002
but

232.98 --> 236.19899999999998
[Music]

237.18 --> 241.44
also

239.28 --> 243.54
Robin Stanley

241.44 --> 246.06
said hello

243.54 --> 249.67999999999998
through the chat also it's nice to hear

246.06 --> 249.68
from her she's doing fine

253.439 --> 259.38
anyway yeah yesterday's weather debate

256.139 --> 262.86
was interesting but

259.38 --> 266.65999999999997
I was I don't know

262.86 --> 266.66
that was very passionate

267.0 --> 272.94
but then yeah I ran into just

270.78 --> 275.03999999999996
issues I don't even remember what the

272.94 --> 279.38
first case was the second it happened

275.04 --> 279.38
twice during the live show

283.72 --> 286.84900000000005
[Music]

289.32 --> 292.46
what that was about

302.52 --> 307.56
damn it I don't even remember what it

304.5 --> 311.28
was but I'm like a little not actually

307.56 --> 313.919
too focused right now but I just like I

311.28 --> 316.44
got annoyed and left went out for

313.919 --> 319.32
groceries got back during the after show

316.44 --> 322.56
and then it happened again

319.32 --> 327.8
and I'm sick of it because I was

322.56 --> 327.8
absolutely not incorrect in either cases

328.8 --> 333.419
and

330.96 --> 333.78999999999996
yeah it's just really annoying when that

333.419 --> 335.75899999999996
happens

333.79 --> 338.46000000000004
[Music]

335.759 --> 340.74
especially if everybody then suddenly

338.46 --> 344.039
for an inexplicable reasons start to

340.74 --> 347.699
side with the opposition when my

344.039 --> 350.4
opposition when they are obviously wrong

347.699 --> 352.32
so it just makes me feel like yeah

350.4 --> 354.23999999999995
you're making Flat Earth look stupid by

352.32 --> 356.84
just not understanding how this is

354.24 --> 356.84000000000003
supposed to work

358.08 --> 364.58
and they I don't know I don't know if

360.3 --> 364.58
they even care that much but I do

364.74 --> 368.82
so yeah

366.479 --> 371.419
I don't know my mood was not all that

368.82 --> 371.419
great yesterday

372.36 --> 378.44
anyway hello PG CNET good to see you

374.759 --> 378.44
then Lennox good to see you

382.319 --> 386.1
uh

383.9 --> 388.62
and by the way if I hadn't mentioned

386.1 --> 392.16
already it is Saturday the 29th of

388.62 --> 392.16
October 2022

394.22 --> 398.759
it should be pretty warm actually

397.09 --> 401.52
[Music]

398.759 --> 405.97900000000004
said it was going to be yesterday

401.52 --> 405.979
all right it's still the same 21 degrees

418.71 --> 421.78999999999996
[Music]

425.84 --> 431.09999999999997
all right so yeah I don't know how how

429.24 --> 433.08
this show is going to roll out or how

431.1 --> 435.86
long it's gonna last because again I'm a

433.08 --> 435.85999999999996
little wonky I

436.02 --> 440.81899999999996
it's hard to tell whether I am going to

438.3 --> 442.74
properly recover and have just a great

440.819 --> 443.699
like second half of the show or

442.74 --> 446.699
something

443.699 --> 449.22
or if I'm just gonna like get even more

446.699 --> 451.74
sick-ish and then cut it off and but

449.22 --> 454.16
then I'll for sure be back tomorrow back

451.74 --> 454.16
to normal

454.199 --> 457.68
uh

455.58 --> 460.52
well let's hope that's not

457.68 --> 460.52
necessary

463.46 --> 466.75899999999996
fresh air

471.3 --> 473.479
thank you

476.73 --> 483.74
[Music]

478.979 --> 483.74
Scott catching up on some Owen Benjamin

487.86 --> 491.06
Wednesday I think

505.919 --> 508.099
foreign

510.08 --> 516.659
went up against another anti-flatter

514.32 --> 518.7
now mctoon

516.659 --> 521.8199999999999
I mean he's doing this a lot I don't

518.7 --> 524.839
even know where he gets the stamina from

521.82 --> 524.839
to do all this

525.42 --> 529.68
it's really annoying dealing with these

528.06 --> 532.399
people

529.68 --> 532.399
uh

541.56 --> 547.1999999999999
but anyway yeah

543.779 --> 550.9399999999999
if he likes to do that you know hey

547.2 --> 550.94
price of Adam good to see you

551.45 --> 555.649
[Music]

568.64 --> 571.85
[Music]

576.14 --> 579.4399999999999
[Music]

579.66 --> 582.4399999999999
mm-hmm

584.339 --> 589.86
yeah

585.8 --> 592.52
he's getting more annoying over time

589.86 --> 595.72
hey jedo good to see you

592.52 --> 595.72
[Music]

614.58 --> 617.58
uh

618.31 --> 627.3789999999999
[Music]

631.019 --> 636.66
you heard more about that yeah pgco but

633.959 --> 638.899
this has been a long going situation by

636.66 --> 638.899
now

644.94 --> 650.0600000000001
but yeah it's pretty rough out there

650.779 --> 655.22
and bad news I mean

655.5 --> 664.72
this craziness has to be stopped

658.44 --> 664.72
[Music]

668.459 --> 673.4399999999999
and I think that there is at least some

670.92 --> 676.62
Headway in this process

673.44 --> 678.36
there is some progress

676.62 --> 680.16
like more

678.36 --> 683.16
people are being more specifically

680.16 --> 685.4399999999999
identified for their actions in the

683.16 --> 688.1
whole ordeal of what's going on it's a

685.44 --> 692.1
vast and complex

688.1 --> 693.98
situation but it is being mapped

692.1 --> 698.279
and

693.98 --> 702.0
[Music]

698.279 --> 704.04
right what what is now known about our

702.0 --> 706.019
government and the people running it and

704.04 --> 708.959
people in Media

706.019 --> 712.399
is more extensive than it was for

708.959 --> 712.399
example two years ago

713.16 --> 716.519
and I think that is a lot of people

715.14 --> 719.16
catching up

716.519 --> 723.3
out there in the Netherlands

719.16 --> 726.24
to it so yeah I really hope that Trend

723.3 --> 727.43
continues and that it's gonna amount to

726.24 --> 729.72
a solution

727.43 --> 732.92
[Music]

729.72 --> 732.9200000000001
final solution

734.579 --> 739.9799999999999
right no more temporary solutions I mean

737.519 --> 742.079
this [ __ ] just has to stop I mean the

739.98 --> 743.64
marxists need to get the [ __ ] out of our

742.079 --> 746.3599999999999
government

743.64 --> 746.36
period

748.32 --> 751.23
no more of that

750.12 --> 764.519
ever

751.23 --> 764.519
[Music]

765.3 --> 770.0
you heard that crazy [ __ ] about Trudeau

770.339 --> 774.839
was now supposedly legalizing

774.899 --> 781.339
doctors being able to euthanize children

778.56 --> 785.18
without their parents consent

781.339 --> 785.1800000000001
I mean come on

796.76 --> 803.859
you didn't hear what yeah no [ __ ] what

800.72 --> 803.859
[Music]

813.44 --> 818.24
let's see if I can find some link to it

819.0 --> 822.0
foreign

834.44 --> 839.94
okay I don't have a direct link or

836.82 --> 842.399
anything but if you just look if you

839.94 --> 844.2600000000001
Google it or search engine it

842.399 --> 847.5
Trudeau

844.26 --> 849.779
child euthanization

847.5 --> 852.899
I'm pretty sure you're gonna find

849.779 --> 854.9399999999999
some official stuff

852.899 --> 857.04
of that because it's not like something

854.94 --> 861.62
that leaked no that's just something

857.04 --> 861.62
they rolled out recently totally insane

863.7 --> 867.019
right anyway

867.06 --> 871.0189999999999
yeah

868.68 --> 872.8199999999999
unsettling things are also rolling out

871.019 --> 875.1
but yeah there is just much more

872.82 --> 878.279
resistance I mean it's not just gonna

875.1 --> 880.98
roll out and nobody

878.279 --> 883.62
nobody's taking note of it except for

880.98 --> 885.27
you the price of atom now it does just

883.62 --> 888.49
kidding

885.27 --> 888.49
[Music]

894.839 --> 897.839
foreign

899.2 --> 903.95
[Music]

908.0 --> 913.62
but every time something like this

910.26 --> 915.779
happens I see comments like who's this

913.62 --> 919.26
the world's this what the rule is coming

915.779 --> 922.92
to right well that's not my response at

919.26 --> 925.079
all because I immediately start figuring

922.92 --> 926.16
out the fractal implications of such a

925.079 --> 928.88
thing

926.16 --> 928.88
you see

929.04 --> 935.519
by doing something like that it doesn't

932.22 --> 936.72
actually just turn everything grim and

935.519 --> 939.839
Evil

936.72 --> 943.26
what it actually does is well shock the

939.839 --> 946.3800000000001
public as to how far

943.26 --> 947.579
down the Eugenics Rabbit Hole Trudeau

946.38 --> 950.639
really is

947.579 --> 952.26
so instead like a little wake-up call

950.639 --> 955.6800000000001
like oh you thought it couldn't get any

952.26 --> 958.26
further oh yeah I can and

955.68 --> 962.8389999999999
it gives uh well

958.26 --> 962.8389999999999
a long-term entrapment opportunity

963.06 --> 969.42
which it seems like it exactly doesn't

965.82 --> 971.399
but two doctors that actually like to do

969.42 --> 975.0
that

971.399 --> 977.79
which I guess is a thing I don't want to

975.0 --> 980.919
know it's very creepy

977.79 --> 980.919
[Music]

983.279 --> 988.92
right so they'll then be green lighted

986.579 --> 991.7399999999999
to start doing that and feel like they

988.92 --> 993.7199999999999
have legal covering well how that really

991.74 --> 996.32
works I don't even know but they'll be

993.72 --> 996.32
like

996.48 --> 999.0790000000001
uh

999.18 --> 1005.8389999999999
lured out to start acting on it see

1003.68 --> 1009.56
and now whether they actually have legal

1005.839 --> 1013.399
cover or if it's just a ruse

1009.56 --> 1016.9399999999999
on the long run there they will then buy

1013.399 --> 1019.279
and by doing that have effective

1016.94 --> 1022.0400000000001
entrapments like people will identify

1019.279 --> 1024.38
them like hey that is actually one that

1022.04 --> 1026.36
freaking kills kids

1024.38 --> 1027.5590000000002
without telling the parents and [ __ ]

1026.36 --> 1030.62
right

1027.559 --> 1032.8999999999999
so fractal implications I'm not just

1030.62 --> 1035.7399999999998
gonna oh is this what is this what the

1032.9 --> 1039.3190000000002
world's coming to yeah it is but also

1035.74 --> 1041.86
look at what that does

1039.319 --> 1041.86
you know

1042.919 --> 1048.26
I mean it's only it will only become

1045.74 --> 1051.14
truly disastrous when something like

1048.26 --> 1054.2
that rolls out when literally everybody

1051.14 --> 1058.179
in the country is gonna fall in line and

1054.2 --> 1058.179
say like yeah we agreed to that

1058.94 --> 1064.5800000000002
and that

1060.799 --> 1067.039
people's kids die this way

1064.58 --> 1068.96
and then they don't do anything about it

1067.039 --> 1071.78
then they don't protest they'll like

1068.96 --> 1076.16
yeah okay yeah

1071.78 --> 1079.28
I guess uh Lil Timmy really had to go

1076.16 --> 1081.98
you know if that happens then it's

1079.28 --> 1084.86
[ __ ] then it's hell on Earth

1081.98 --> 1088.72
but that's like that's not realistic

1084.86 --> 1093.62
something like that would only really

1088.72 --> 1095.24
hopefully mostly pop up in Crazy comedy

1093.62 --> 1098.0
sketches right

1095.24 --> 1100.94
Monty python-esque situations

1098.0 --> 1103.94
but in reality that should not ever

1100.94 --> 1107.2
happen if it did then it's really

1103.94 --> 1110.3600000000001
[ __ ] scary because then those people

1107.2 --> 1113.3600000000001
potentially a nation entirely is just

1110.36 --> 1115.3999999999999
completely demonically possessed in a

1113.36 --> 1116.6599999999999
collective way which is incredibly

1115.4 --> 1119.6200000000001
dangerous

1116.66 --> 1119.6200000000001
on the long run

1120.14 --> 1127.3400000000001
because when demons get actual power in

1124.16 --> 1129.38
people they're gonna make moves

1127.34 --> 1132.82
they're going to spread it

1129.38 --> 1136.72
we we should know that right now anyway

1132.82 --> 1136.72
so that's how I see it

1143.78 --> 1149.26
right and it's very well known Trudeau

1146.12 --> 1149.26
is wef

1149.6 --> 1154.8799999999999
it's like one of the first one that was

1152.12 --> 1158.84
publicly identified and bragged about by

1154.88 --> 1163.1200000000001
Cloud swab so yeah

1158.84 --> 1166.76
I mean the more it's exposed and seen

1163.12 --> 1169.6399999999999
the more it will have a sink in effect

1166.76 --> 1172.22
one way or the other towards slave or

1169.64 --> 1174.8600000000001
towards independence mentally

1172.22 --> 1177.26
right so it's kind of like forcing the

1174.86 --> 1179.6
The Awakening and the polarization

1177.26 --> 1180.28
against it simultaneously depending on

1179.6 --> 1185.299
the

1180.28 --> 1187.58
life Spirit choice of the individual

1185.299 --> 1191.3799999999999
that is part of it

1187.58 --> 1191.3799999999999
right hmm

1196.54 --> 1201.049
[Music]

1203.96 --> 1208.46
yeah of course price of Adam

1206.0 --> 1209.419
yeah because in Pixar movies and all

1208.46 --> 1212.78
that

1209.419 --> 1215.48
Disney movies it's okay it's not

1212.78 --> 1219.02
supposed to be scientific right you

1215.48 --> 1221.74
don't have to necessarily criticize the

1219.02 --> 1221.74
technicals

1229.039 --> 1234.58
so you have your

1231.7 --> 1238.3400000000001
presuppositional outer space

1234.58 --> 1242.26
enjoyment and excitement without all the

1238.34 --> 1242.26
math and the complications and [ __ ]

1242.539 --> 1245.84
and like how is it actually supposed to

1244.58 --> 1247.8799999999999
be

1245.84 --> 1248.9599999999998
right you can improvise more in the

1247.88 --> 1252.2
movies

1248.96 --> 1255.28
make it more about the visuals

1252.2 --> 1255.28
right so

1274.29 --> 1281.79
[Music]

1314.95 --> 1318.18
[Music]

1324.62 --> 1327.28
foreign

1340.9 --> 1346.4
by the way I thought that on yesterday's

1343.76 --> 1349.58
show it didn't really title it what that

1346.4 --> 1351.8600000000001
the whole part about the microscope

1349.58 --> 1354.3999999999999
was actually a turnout to be really

1351.86 --> 1354.3999999999999
interesting

1355.1 --> 1361.6399999999999
I mean when it when we dug in there

1358.94 --> 1364.5800000000002
was a touch person then it was caught

1361.64 --> 1365.68
counterfeiting I mean that that like

1364.58 --> 1367.24
totally

1365.68 --> 1370.76
[Music]

1367.24 --> 1373.159
crystallized like more detail of just

1370.76 --> 1375.559
what was actually going on

1373.159 --> 1378.14
it was so revealing to me

1375.559 --> 1379.22
and in retrospect I also make this kind

1378.14 --> 1382.64
of sense

1379.22 --> 1384.679
seeing as that like well telescopes and

1382.64 --> 1386.9
microscopes are really not all that

1384.679 --> 1392.14
different technologically

1386.9 --> 1392.14
and while the telescopes come from well

1394.94 --> 1399.679
I said

1396.82 --> 1402.26
Jesuits I think mostly

1399.679 --> 1405.799
and then a microscope

1402.26 --> 1407.6
would probably either be

1405.799 --> 1411.2
Lent

1407.6 --> 1413.299
from that concept or

1411.2 --> 1415.1000000000001
there's yeah there might be some like

1413.299 --> 1417.9189999999999
two involvement it makes sense because

1415.1 --> 1420.86
yeah Jews had it

1417.919 --> 1424.2800000000002
there's like nothing actual Jews not

1420.86 --> 1426.08
like crazy satanic ones in the media or

1424.28 --> 1427.46
whatever but like the actual ones

1426.08 --> 1430.6999999999998
traditionally had like

1427.46 --> 1432.74
gem cutting right that's like an old

1430.7 --> 1436.48
Jewish profession

1432.74 --> 1439.4
a very long time well gem cutting is

1436.48 --> 1442.1
not really all that different an

1439.4 --> 1444.26
approach as like lens making

1442.1 --> 1448.28
right

1444.26 --> 1451.82
so makes sense that that all comes from

1448.28 --> 1455.24
the same skill source

1451.82 --> 1457.6399999999999
so I would State roughly

1455.24 --> 1459.5
that like

1457.64 --> 1461.6000000000001
telescopes

1459.5 --> 1462.98
and microscopes

1461.6 --> 1467.62
are

1462.98 --> 1467.6200000000001
are like a logical development

1467.78 --> 1472.7
from gem cutting

1470.659 --> 1475.64
right

1472.7 --> 1478.1000000000001
and therefore basically not surprising

1475.64 --> 1479.659
that that that these inventions won't

1478.1 --> 1483.86
pop forth

1479.659 --> 1483.8600000000001
from Jews right

1484.1 --> 1487.8999999999999
I just thought it was really interesting

1498.08 --> 1504.32
yeah microscopes are fascinating

1501.919 --> 1507.0200000000002
also because it's just this micro world

1504.32 --> 1509.78
and it's not digital right that's like

1507.02 --> 1511.7
the remarkable part about is that you're

1509.78 --> 1515.44
actually looking at something that is

1511.7 --> 1515.44
really just that

1518.24 --> 1523.7
I always liked like microscopes during

1520.76 --> 1525.62
biology and all that I like microscopes

1523.7 --> 1527.659
I think microscopes are very interesting

1525.62 --> 1530.03
and useful

1527.659 --> 1532.22
a great tool and

1530.03 --> 1535.52
[Music]

1532.22 --> 1537.919
it's mostly just mechanical right it's

1535.52 --> 1541.34
not so all you have to do electronic now

1537.919 --> 1543.98
it's it's lenses and and gear

1541.34 --> 1546.98
and yeah usually a little

1543.98 --> 1549.5
electronic light right to shine it extra

1546.98 --> 1551.659
right so you can see it more easily

1549.5 --> 1555.559
and in the olden days they would have

1551.659 --> 1558.17
probably yeah use like a candle right a

1555.559 --> 1560.4189999999999
candle with a small mirror or something

1558.17 --> 1562.46
[Music]

1560.419 --> 1565.76
so

1562.46 --> 1568.1000000000001
you don't even necessarily need it's not

1565.76 --> 1570.3799999999999
like an automatically Electronics

1568.1 --> 1574.48
dependent device

1570.38 --> 1574.48
that's always interesting and good

1577.45 --> 1580.999
[Music]

1591.2 --> 1594.339
[Music]

1596.659 --> 1601.46
I don't know

1598.94 --> 1603.679
right yeah once you go into this super

1601.46 --> 1607.179
deep magnification you're eventually

1603.679 --> 1607.179
gonna need electronic light

1607.76 --> 1610.48
of course

1612.679 --> 1616.4
I mean the more Precision yeah

1614.72 --> 1619.76
Electronics will start to become

1616.4 --> 1622.8200000000002
involved but just for the rudimentaries

1619.76 --> 1624.3799999999999
and originally they used it

1622.82 --> 1627.08
without

1624.38 --> 1630.0800000000002
and they made progress and

1627.08 --> 1630.08
discovery

1630.14 --> 1635.6000000000001
like within biology thanks to it without

1633.38 --> 1638.679
electronics

1635.6 --> 1638.6789999999999
and that's pretty cool

1647.26 --> 1653.0
magpies no way the jackdaws

1650.14 --> 1655.0400000000002
territorially bickering

1653.0 --> 1664.179
puffy

1655.04 --> 1667.039
[Music]

1664.179 --> 1669.64
starting to feel a little better

1667.039 --> 1669.64
awesome

1674.779 --> 1680.299
it's just that like my my guts really do

1678.08 --> 1682.34
not like it when I don't sleep properly

1680.299 --> 1685.52
and get like

1682.34 --> 1688.4599999999998
I'm kept from sleeping that's really bad

1685.52 --> 1690.62
for my intestines and all that so but I

1688.46 --> 1693.6200000000001
think they're recovering already

1690.62 --> 1696.1399999999999
who was in that car I don't know

1693.62 --> 1698.7199999999998
I didn't see

1696.14 --> 1701.0590000000002
if I'd had to guess I'd say from the

1698.72 --> 1705.159
music it was either

1701.059 --> 1708.1399999999999
a black guy or like a

1705.159 --> 1710.179
Moroccan or a Turkish an Arabian or a

1708.14 --> 1713.48
black guy because he had like

1710.179 --> 1717.3200000000002
kind of Arabian Style music and typical

1713.48 --> 1719.919
just Congo Bongo

1717.32 --> 1719.9189999999999
music

1720.14 --> 1725.539
that sort of stuff but I didn't get to

1722.659 --> 1728.48
see a it was night and I was like trying

1725.539 --> 1729.99
to sleep and I didn't care I just wanted

1728.48 --> 1736.819
the noise to stop

1729.99 --> 1736.819
[Music]

1739.1 --> 1744.799
[Music]

1741.64 --> 1746.659
right but apparently also yeah when the

1744.799 --> 1749.059
police gave me a ring back apparently

1746.659 --> 1752.679
they like forbade him to drive away

1749.059 --> 1752.6789999999999
which is like oh thanks

1753.2 --> 1758.8990000000001
thank you for that but they didn't start

1756.679 --> 1762.799
he did they I did actually stop playing

1758.899 --> 1764.899
the music so that's good but yeah I

1762.799 --> 1768.76
hadn't anticipated that like yeah the

1764.899 --> 1772.039
guy is probably on drugs and [ __ ]

1768.76 --> 1775.039
I mean you would have to be if you well

1772.039 --> 1777.64
do that in the middle of the night

1775.039 --> 1777.64
uh

1783.38 --> 1788.96
all right and hey I get it man you won a

1786.559 --> 1792.46
little party and all that

1788.96 --> 1792.46
you don't want like

1792.799 --> 1798.98
the wife or something if they even have

1796.159 --> 1801.44
one or their kids around when they do

1798.98 --> 1803.0
that they want to decompress right and

1801.44 --> 1805.279
this yeah I'm gonna address it even

1803.0 --> 1808.039
though I don't really want to because I

1805.279 --> 1811.46
hate it I hate people

1808.039 --> 1814.1
that put on loud [ __ ] music

1811.46 --> 1816.98
hate it I hate those people it doesn't

1814.1 --> 1818.0
matter why you do it I hate it and I

1816.98 --> 1820.76
hate you

1818.0 --> 1822.62
I hate that you like that it's so

1820.76 --> 1825.26
disturbing

1822.62 --> 1827.12
and usually your music sucks

1825.26 --> 1829.399
because the people that do that their

1827.12 --> 1832.4599999999998
music also sucks

1829.399 --> 1833.4189999999999
right but why do they do it

1832.46 --> 1835.46
right

1833.419 --> 1839.38
it's like the same reason as why some

1835.46 --> 1839.38
people go to like disc attacks

1840.02 --> 1846.679
right they just want to go into the

1843.919 --> 1851.38
vibrating chamber they do it like a sort

1846.679 --> 1851.38
of Massage Therapy they want you to

1851.86 --> 1858.559
right they want to be vibrated by the

1856.94 --> 1861.0800000000002
[ __ ] loud noise and they're probably

1858.559 --> 1862.52
all deaf and if they aren't then you

1861.08 --> 1866.72
will be

1862.52 --> 1868.82
but they do it like a sort of a massage

1866.72 --> 1871.159
that's why I think that some of these

1868.82 --> 1874.279
people get addicted to that [ __ ] and do

1871.159 --> 1876.44
it even though it's extremely disturbing

1874.279 --> 1879.2
to everybody in the environment because

1876.44 --> 1881.419
if some [ __ ] does that then you're

1879.2 --> 1884.0
literally like waking up or keeping

1881.419 --> 1885.3200000000002
awake ruining people's day

1884.0 --> 1887.659
for like

1885.32 --> 1890.0
50 people

1887.659 --> 1891.8600000000001
potentially right

1890.0 --> 1893.299
because not all of them are like even

1891.86 --> 1894.4399999999998
gonna call the police they're going to

1893.299 --> 1895.82
try to sit through it but it's still

1894.44 --> 1898.7
going to ruin their day

1895.82 --> 1901.8799999999999
so it's [ __ ] annoying

1898.7 --> 1904.039
and people do that but I do get it and

1901.88 --> 1907.1000000000001
everyone was like yeah those types of

1904.039 --> 1910.76
people just need like little private

1907.1 --> 1912.08
rooms not for squirting

1910.76 --> 1914.24
hopefully

1912.08 --> 1916.1
but where they're just

1914.24 --> 1918.6200000000001
where they could like sit in this

1916.1 --> 1921.32
isolated little bunker chamber or

1918.62 --> 1925.34
something and just put on [ __ ] loud

1921.32 --> 1929.0
music until their head explodes but in a

1925.34 --> 1933.34
way that nobody else can hear it now

1929.0 --> 1933.34
that's a solution

1933.5 --> 1937.58
huh

1934.88 --> 1941.48
how about that

1937.58 --> 1945.4399999999998
like a safe room but uh but not for oh

1941.48 --> 1947.6
no burglars or War but literally so you

1945.44 --> 1949.7
can just sit in there play your [ __ ]

1947.6 --> 1952.279
loud music as loud as you want as a

1949.7 --> 1953.48
[ __ ] just to Shake Yourself Loose and

1952.279 --> 1956.24
all that

1953.48 --> 1958.279
but that nobody else is gonna be

1956.24 --> 1961.6
bothered about it

1958.279 --> 1961.6
with it yeah

1963.44 --> 1968.6200000000001
I hope

1965.26 --> 1970.52
that this might

1968.62 --> 1973.6999999999998
develop

1970.52 --> 1975.98
an idea like this

1973.7 --> 1977.6100000000001
that can't stand cars with a loud

1975.98 --> 1978.98
exhaust well that's yeah

1977.61 --> 1981.1399999999999
[Music]

1978.98 --> 1984.32
well that's illegal here by the way

1981.14 --> 1986.8400000000001
Alicia I mean if your exhaust is too

1984.32 --> 1990.02
loud that's literally like in the code

1986.84 --> 1993.1399999999999
of of the road you're not even allowed

1990.02 --> 1995.779
that here right but people playing

1993.14 --> 1999.38
super loud music with their [ __ ]

1995.779 --> 2001.779
little subwoofers so cool subwoofer yeah

1999.38 --> 2003.88
those [ __ ]

2001.779 --> 2006.1
that just

2003.88 --> 2008.98
they're just doing that

2006.1 --> 2011.74
and I I wish they wouldn't

2008.98 --> 2014.5
I really wish people would not use their

2011.74 --> 2016.539
stupid car sit out somewhere thinking

2014.5 --> 2019.299
that nobody can hear them in the middle

2016.539 --> 2020.44
of the night and play Inc insanely loud

2019.299 --> 2022.179
music

2020.44 --> 2025.419
that literally is going to keep

2022.179 --> 2029.019
everybody awake in like a radius of half

2025.419 --> 2030.76
a mile or something like [ __ ] off

2029.019 --> 2033.7
foreign

2030.76 --> 2036.58
and like don't do that like don't ever

2033.7 --> 2039.1000000000001
do that yeah if you want to play music

2036.58 --> 2042.46
like that that loud

2039.1 --> 2045.519
then you have to find a designated place

2042.46 --> 2047.26
where literally you cannot keep people

2045.519 --> 2051.24
awake

2047.26 --> 2051.24
like find a bunker or something

2059.08 --> 2063.239
anyway

2061.839 --> 2066.5589999999997
yeah

2063.239 --> 2066.559
[Music]

2070.06 --> 2074.08
yeah my mother used to be even worse by

2072.46 --> 2077.76
the way with this because my mother

2074.08 --> 2077.7599999999998
would complain about any noise

2078.94 --> 2084.2200000000003
so she was even yeah she was more

2081.399 --> 2086.98
annoying about it and like annoyed us

2084.22 --> 2089.2
when we would barely even hear anything

2086.98 --> 2091.72
so she would just complain if there was

2089.2 --> 2093.8199999999997
an absolute perfect silence in the

2091.72 --> 2095.7999999999997
Netherlands right

2093.82 --> 2097.599
how reasonable

2095.8 --> 2100.2400000000002
ugh

2097.599 --> 2104.28
but yeah I'm not that sensitive but if

2100.24 --> 2104.2799999999997
it's subwoofers man I mean

2108.46 --> 2114.579
I'm all almost like

2111.54 --> 2119.32
considering ideas like

2114.579 --> 2122.94
maybe subwoofers should be illegal to

2119.32 --> 2122.94
have installed in cars

2124.24 --> 2129.72
how about that how about just making it

2127.119 --> 2129.7200000000003
illegal

2131.2 --> 2137.98
I mean in Europe I think that that might

2136.0 --> 2139.18
be doable they might actually do

2137.98 --> 2140.76
something like that and everybody's

2139.18 --> 2144.94
going to be oh that'd be a rock Crush

2140.76 --> 2148.119
yeah but it's really [ __ ] annoying

2144.94 --> 2151.7200000000003
[ __ ] subwoofers I hate subwoofers

2148.119 --> 2153.82
[ __ ] subwoofers yeah oh I got a

2151.72 --> 2155.56
subwoofer oh that means that every time

2153.82 --> 2157.54
you turn that [ __ ] thing on you're

2155.56 --> 2160.66
gonna ruin somebody's day

2157.54 --> 2163.32
even like if it's in your house because

2160.66 --> 2166.839
you hear that right through the walls

2163.32 --> 2169.06
very far even when you think oh I'm not

2166.839 --> 2171.099
doing that loud but you got your

2169.06 --> 2173.619
subwoofer on oh you that's not that loud

2171.099 --> 2177.3590000000004
yeah but everybody can [ __ ] hear it

2173.619 --> 2183.78
then yeah subwoofers

2177.359 --> 2183.7799999999997
hate them I hate [ __ ] subwoofers

2189.119 --> 2193.6800000000003
what the [ __ ] hello Adam Aiken

2195.579 --> 2201.4
now this is just practical Solutions I

2198.52 --> 2203.56
mean yeah people want to party well make

2201.4 --> 2206.46
sure that you're not gonna bother other

2203.56 --> 2206.46
people with it then

2207.3 --> 2212.76
and dude maybe this can be like

2211.0 --> 2217.24
almost like

2212.76 --> 2221.1600000000003
industrial yeah like what for example

2217.24 --> 2221.16
if there was just like a

2221.32 --> 2225.7000000000003
sort of

2222.64 --> 2227.14
sort of but not exactly like a parking

2225.7 --> 2229.4199999999996
garage

2227.14 --> 2231.5789999999997
where you can just literally Drive in

2229.42 --> 2233.98
with your car

2231.579 --> 2236.7400000000002
and for like I don't know a few bucks

2233.98 --> 2240.16
you can stay there for the night and

2236.74 --> 2242.68
then inside in the designated parking

2240.16 --> 2245.5
spot you can literally sit there

2242.68 --> 2249.22
in separated compartments or a more open

2245.5 --> 2251.56
and just listen to music and [ __ ] as

2249.22 --> 2255.2999999999997
long as you don't leave any garbage

2251.56 --> 2255.2999999999997
there will be cameras there of course

2255.339 --> 2258.4
right

2256.66 --> 2260.68
just to be sure

2258.4 --> 2264.88
and that you can just play your [ __ ]

2260.68 --> 2266.68
music and be alone bro oh we're having a

2264.88 --> 2270.7000000000003
special

2266.68 --> 2272.44
party music and loud right but in that

2270.7 --> 2276.06
building that building would then be

2272.44 --> 2276.06
designed to specifically

2276.3 --> 2281.3390000000004
absorb that [ __ ] noise right

2281.98 --> 2286.42
if they just had some building

2284.74 --> 2288.8199999999997
in a city

2286.42 --> 2291.2200000000003
and yeah people like that would be

2288.82 --> 2293.079
sitting nagging with their stupid music

2291.22 --> 2295.48
keeping people awake calling the police

2293.079 --> 2298.1800000000003
well then the police might be like hey

2295.48 --> 2301.119
dude you want to do this

2298.18 --> 2303.339
you want your own music

2301.119 --> 2304.2400000000002
are you one of your special time on your

2303.339 --> 2307.54
own

2304.24 --> 2310.2999999999997
well don't come here there's a special

2307.54 --> 2312.82
building there where you can drive in

2310.3 --> 2315.2200000000003
with your car and do that and it's not

2312.82 --> 2318.88
gonna bother anybody right so you just

2315.22 --> 2321.8799999999997
go there don't come back here

2318.88 --> 2321.88
solved

2323.65 --> 2328.48
[Music]

2326.74 --> 2330.2799999999997
idea headphone yeah but that doesn't

2328.48 --> 2332.619
work seeking star water it's not about

2330.28 --> 2333.8390000000004
hearing the music it's about day one

2332.619 --> 2337.2400000000002
that

2333.839 --> 2340.119
vibration [ __ ] right it like they put

2337.24 --> 2342.339
the music on like loud idiots there's

2340.119 --> 2344.32
people that don't like that like to

2342.339 --> 2347.74
refer to them as

2344.32 --> 2350.6800000000003
not because they want to hear it so loud

2347.74 --> 2352.4199999999996
no they want to be

2350.68 --> 2355.2999999999997
[Music]

2352.42 --> 2358.2400000000002
they want to be shaken they want to be

2355.3 --> 2361.119
physically vibrated by their stupid bass

2358.24 --> 2364.54
noises because it is like a massage to

2361.119 --> 2367.7200000000003
them it probably loosens up a whole

2364.54 --> 2369.52
bunch of stuff related to deep stress

2367.72 --> 2372.7599999999998
and [ __ ] because people that do that

2369.52 --> 2374.74
often have really serious trash issues

2372.76 --> 2376.599
that's why they do it

2374.74 --> 2378.339
they do it to kind of like Shake

2376.599 --> 2380.56
themselves loose and I don't want to

2378.339 --> 2382.66
necessarily deprive them of that option

2380.56 --> 2384.04
they might go really depressed or

2382.66 --> 2387.8199999999997
something if they don't

2384.04 --> 2391.9
but then accommodate for it

2387.82 --> 2394.96
make sure you don't do it in the open

2391.9 --> 2397.78
and [ __ ] keep people awake

2394.96 --> 2401.2
have a special place where you're sure

2397.78 --> 2404.02
you're not gonna bother other people and

2401.2 --> 2407.3999999999996
have the cops call on you again

2404.02 --> 2407.4
for keeping them awake

2407.619 --> 2412.1800000000003
right

2409.66 --> 2415.48
so fix it

2412.18 --> 2419.04
have a designated building it would be

2415.48 --> 2421.9
like it was like a like a parking garage

2419.04 --> 2424.24
downward right into the ground because

2421.9 --> 2427.7200000000003
there's nothing more absorbent of sound

2424.24 --> 2430.8999999999996
than just a giant wall of dirt

2427.72 --> 2433.0
so it's like a parking basement

2430.9 --> 2436.06
where you can just play your [ __ ]

2433.0 --> 2438.9
music as loud as you want

2436.06 --> 2441.2799999999997
and it could even be in that building

2438.9 --> 2443.2000000000003
compartmentalized so that there can be

2441.28 --> 2446.5
multiple people

2443.2 --> 2449.5
that can play different musics without

2446.5 --> 2451.839
like noising each other out

2449.5 --> 2453.099
right

2451.839 --> 2455.38
so they can have like their own

2453.099 --> 2457.839
compartment where they can be just one

2455.38 --> 2459.94
guy in their car in a compartment thing

2457.839 --> 2461.5
and who knows man you could even like

2459.94 --> 2464.5
install

2461.5 --> 2466.96
whatever projectors screens I don't know

2464.5 --> 2469.18
how elaborate you want to do that make

2466.96 --> 2471.28
it almost like a drive-in situation that

2469.18 --> 2473.5
they could move what you you could do it

2471.28 --> 2476.02
as elaborate as they want but the more

2473.5 --> 2478.18
important thing is that

2476.02 --> 2480.64
that the people that have these

2478.18 --> 2482.0789999999997
Tendencies to want to play Loud [ __ ]

2480.64 --> 2485.98
music in their car in the middle of the

2482.079 --> 2488.32
night that they have a place to go where

2485.98 --> 2490.66
that sound is not gonna bother other

2488.32 --> 2493.02
people and that they can still do that

2490.66 --> 2493.02
yeah

2494.74 --> 2498.8999999999996
this is actually a pretty serious idea

2504.359 --> 2510.94
right because well noise pollution

2507.7 --> 2512.2799999999997
creates stress stress creates Health

2510.94 --> 2516.099
detriment

2512.28 --> 2520.3590000000004
and well a detriment also um I don't

2516.099 --> 2522.1600000000003
know economics um work quality right so

2520.359 --> 2524.7
it's you almost have to do something

2522.16 --> 2524.7
like this

2531.22 --> 2537.3999999999996
right and just say oh baddies they're

2534.22 --> 2539.14
very bad it's just illegal and just

2537.4 --> 2540.7000000000003
arrest them every time well these people

2539.14 --> 2543.7
or who knows man maybe they're doing

2540.7 --> 2545.52
this just to like get back to normal

2543.7 --> 2547.7799999999997
they're just

2545.52 --> 2550.72
and they're drugs and [ __ ] just because

2547.78 --> 2553.2400000000002
they're like ah I'm trying to prevent

2550.72 --> 2555.52
from turning into a homicidal maniac

2553.24 --> 2558.0989999999997
because my colleagues are so [ __ ] up

2555.52 --> 2559.9
but I gotta keep going it could be

2558.099 --> 2562.42
anything right

2559.9 --> 2565.599
you don't know these people

2562.42 --> 2568.0
they're probably doing it because they

2565.599 --> 2571.119
really need that because they're just

2568.0 --> 2573.64
otherwise they'd go insane

2571.119 --> 2577.359
so if they're gonna do that and you

2573.64 --> 2580.42
don't want to just like ruin them

2577.359 --> 2582.46
well maybe they can

2580.42 --> 2584.8
make it fit

2582.46 --> 2586.9
yeah

2584.8 --> 2588.94
I mean

2586.9 --> 2590.5
wouldn't it wouldn't everybody be better

2588.94 --> 2591.7000000000003
off if there was just this basement

2590.5 --> 2594.339
building

2591.7 --> 2596.74
where you could drive in with your car

2594.339 --> 2600.4
in your own separate compartment

2596.74 --> 2601.9599999999996
and just play that music [ __ ] loud as

2600.4 --> 2605.92
loud as you want

2601.96 --> 2609.359
right maybe even have like a a screen or

2605.92 --> 2609.359
a projector for whatever

2609.579 --> 2614.2000000000003
I mean those are all bonuses right those

2611.8 --> 2615.88
are all things that you can like you can

2614.2 --> 2617.9199999999996
have this special room with the

2615.88 --> 2620.26
projector and that costs a little extra

2617.92 --> 2622.92
like then you adapt to pay to get in

2620.26 --> 2622.92
there right

2623.2 --> 2627.85
and it yeah it could be a dude you could

2626.26 --> 2629.26
make a freaking industry out of this

2627.85 --> 2632.02
[Music]

2629.26 --> 2634.599
I mean and everybody's going to be

2632.02 --> 2637.98
happier they're not kept awake in the

2634.599 --> 2637.98
middle of the night you know

2638.92 --> 2644.02
so

2640.599 --> 2648.28
yeah I'm literally Conjuring this thing

2644.02 --> 2650.44
and I really hope that somebody's gonna

2648.28 --> 2652.1800000000003
consider it consider doing something

2650.44 --> 2655.06
like that

2652.18 --> 2657.52
sounds like an fnf Tokyo Drift scene

2655.06 --> 2661.44
what is that

2657.52 --> 2661.44
Final Fantasy Tokyo what

2676.72 --> 2681.339
murderers would use that place

2679.42 --> 2684.339
well that's why you gotta have cameras

2681.339 --> 2687.22
of course I mean there's got to be like

2684.339 --> 2689.38
a just like a parking garage right a

2687.22 --> 2691.839
security

2689.38 --> 2694.7400000000002
I mean it it's gonna have to be sort of

2691.839 --> 2694.74
paid for system

2696.339 --> 2702.099
but yeah I mean it's worth not getting a

2700.48 --> 2704.44
police record

2702.099 --> 2707.7400000000002
you know or potentially getting arrested

2704.44 --> 2711.339
and nobody's gonna like disturb you for

2707.74 --> 2713.5
I don't know doing your drugs as long as

2711.339 --> 2714.819
you don't cause damage because then of

2713.5 --> 2716.38
course they're gonna call the police

2714.819 --> 2718.9
immediately

2716.38 --> 2719.92
because you're like well vandalizing or

2718.9 --> 2722.4
whatever

2719.92 --> 2722.4
right

2724.24 --> 2728.7599999999998
oh movie right

2739.92 --> 2744.88
the best speakers are a way for people

2743.2 --> 2746.319
who don't have anything interesting to

2744.88 --> 2748.7200000000003
say they have a large fear of influence

2746.319 --> 2751.0
maybe or if they're doing it

2748.72 --> 2753.0989999999997
specifically for that then immediately

2751.0 --> 2755.079
call the police

2753.099 --> 2757.599
if you know they're just doing it

2755.079 --> 2760.7400000000002
they're like if these people are just

2757.599 --> 2764.02
putting their car on loud and

2760.74 --> 2765.64
then they're outside of their car and

2764.02 --> 2768.24
looking around if they're getting

2765.64 --> 2771.0989999999997
noticed yeah if it's like that

2768.24 --> 2773.68
immediately call the police

2771.099 --> 2776.38
immediately

2773.68 --> 2778.359
right that's not somebody trying to

2776.38 --> 2780.52
enjoy themselves or getting their own

2778.359 --> 2783.0989999999997
private time

2780.52 --> 2785.2599999999998
right if they're just doing it on

2783.099 --> 2786.819
purpose yeah that's literally like

2785.26 --> 2789.099
harassment

2786.819 --> 2791.44
so

2789.099 --> 2795.32
there is no soundproof place to go well

2791.44 --> 2798.5190000000002
it doesn't seem like like it right now

2795.32 --> 2798.5190000000002
[Music]

2798.76 --> 2805.6600000000003
oh okay Adam making yeah I got the photo

2802.06 --> 2807.819
that's from that movie Tokyo Drift right

2805.66 --> 2809.859
well this is it

2807.819 --> 2813.18
kind of interesting but this is

2809.859 --> 2813.18
basically kind of like a party

2813.4 --> 2816.88
right

2814.839 --> 2820.119
it shouldn't be for that it shouldn't be

2816.88 --> 2822.339
like a party ground if there was just a

2820.119 --> 2824.619
public party ground and everybody can

2822.339 --> 2827.68
just run in and have a party that's

2824.619 --> 2832.3
going to be a giant mess

2827.68 --> 2834.2799999999997
I mean you might potentially also use it

2832.3 --> 2835.2400000000002
for that but then there's gonna be entry

2834.28 --> 2837.94
fees

2835.24 --> 2841.359
right you can't have people just give

2837.94 --> 2842.859
them free party room unless yeah because

2841.359 --> 2845.04
somebody's gonna have to take care of

2842.859 --> 2845.04
that

2849.16 --> 2855.24
maybe we could then no no then that

2852.4 --> 2855.2400000000002
makes no sense

2855.339 --> 2861.2799999999997
the speakers are specifically made to be

2858.04 --> 2863.5
loud the subwoofers

2861.28 --> 2866.079
right so it

2863.5 --> 2871.0
if it continues to be a problem then I

2866.079 --> 2873.1600000000003
would definitely say forbid them

2871.0 --> 2876.64
make them forbidden for public

2873.16 --> 2879.819
consumption like sure special like if

2876.64 --> 2883.54
you're a party like an official party

2879.819 --> 2886.119
like or a stage performer right

2883.54 --> 2889.96
sure

2886.119 --> 2893.2200000000003
but not just any [ __ ] can have one in

2889.96 --> 2893.2200000000003
his car or in his home

2893.5 --> 2900.099
right

2895.599 --> 2902.94
so maybe in that sense license it

2900.099 --> 2907.8590000000004
sounds really bad I know it's very

2902.94 --> 2907.859
non-free but I mean come on

2909.88 --> 2915.6400000000003
if you just mandate that you need a

2913.599 --> 2917.5
license to have a subwoofer based on the

2915.64 --> 2920.14
conditions as to what you're using it

2917.5 --> 2922.66
for so that you don't

2920.14 --> 2924.52
keep people awake with your stupid

2922.66 --> 2928.839
Hobbies

2924.52 --> 2932.7
right then that would solve a lot

2928.839 --> 2932.7
at least on the short run I'd say

2936.339 --> 2943.72
license now any

2939.52 --> 2946.359
then then Winfield there are no non-loud

2943.72 --> 2948.4599999999996
subwoofers

2946.359 --> 2950.7999999999997
yeah

2948.46 --> 2953.339
all of them are like some of them are

2950.8 --> 2956.1400000000003
insane they're like the the

2953.339 --> 2958.599
cubic meter things right that's really

2956.14 --> 2961.0
[ __ ] insane things that are actually

2958.599 --> 2962.98
that could potentially like rip your

2961.0 --> 2965.56
organs or whatever if it was turned on

2962.98 --> 2969.099
loud enough yeah but that's just a

2965.56 --> 2971.98
straight out Hazard right that's not but

2969.099 --> 2975.7000000000003
any subwoof or even like a subwoofer as

2971.98 --> 2977.92
big as this can make a [ __ ] on a noise

2975.7 --> 2982.0
and it's always going to be used like

2977.92 --> 2983.6800000000003
that so forbid it just

2982.0 --> 2986.68
say no

2983.68 --> 2989.2599999999998
you can only have any form of subwoofers

2986.68 --> 2991.54
with a special license

2989.26 --> 2993.4
like because you're an Entertainer and

2991.54 --> 2995.74
you have scheduled

2993.4 --> 2999.1800000000003
use of the time

2995.74 --> 2999.18
right specific

3008.819 --> 3013.02
so yeah

3010.859 --> 3015.38
that's what you get for keeping me awake

3013.02 --> 3015.38
at night

3017.099 --> 3020.94
I feel a little bit like a Jew for for

3019.38 --> 3024.599
doing all this

3020.94 --> 3027.98
but I mean I have actually strived for

3024.599 --> 3032.04
for real solutions and not just

3027.98 --> 3034.98
bad so they must suffer without any

3032.04 --> 3039.38
anything to replace whatever they're

3034.98 --> 3039.38
doing yeah I wouldn't do that like that

3050.64 --> 3057.359
all right yeah but we just seen it look

3055.02 --> 3059.94
it all depends you know I mean if the

3057.359 --> 3063.18
police doesn't come anymore

3059.94 --> 3065.4
to stop people that do that constantly

3063.18 --> 3067.9199999999996
and I'm not recommending to do this

3065.4 --> 3069.78
because it's probably illegal but I just

3067.92 --> 3072.119
start throwing rocks man

3069.78 --> 3074.1600000000003
like oh really oh you're just gonna

3072.119 --> 3075.6600000000003
police not coming you're just gonna keep

3074.16 --> 3078.839
doing I'm just gonna start throwing

3075.66 --> 3080.94
rocks just trash the [ __ ] car

3078.839 --> 3083.42
just keep throwing rocks until they

3080.94 --> 3083.42
speed away

3083.88 --> 3089.6400000000003
[ __ ] you [ __ ] you and your [ __ ] noise

3086.88 --> 3092.04
I don't care what you are how you look

3089.64 --> 3094.44
what you associate with

3092.04 --> 3097.079
if you're just gonna keep making that

3094.44 --> 3099.599
[ __ ] noise and nobody's there to stop

3097.079 --> 3102.42
you police doesn't come or whatever

3099.599 --> 3105.599
just start throwing rocks yeah

3102.42 --> 3109.28
enjoy your [ __ ] little music with

3105.599 --> 3109.28
broken windows and dents

3109.559 --> 3114.059
but don't do this it's illegal but I

3112.44 --> 3115.68
mean yeah if the police just doesn't

3114.059 --> 3119.48
come what the hell are you supposed to

3115.68 --> 3119.48
do just suffer through it

3125.819 --> 3130.5
right right I'm glad that at least the

3128.099 --> 3134.839
police here does actually come really

3130.5 --> 3134.839
happy about it really happy

3135.72 --> 3140.9599999999996
I'm very happy with the police here in

3137.7 --> 3140.96
this city I really am

3143.579 --> 3148.52
throw rocks in the hood

3146.04 --> 3152.0
you gotta figure it out I was just

3148.52 --> 3152.0
generalizing you know

3152.04 --> 3157.52
I mean don't just don't don't throw

3154.859 --> 3160.739
rocks just just don't do it

3157.52 --> 3160.739

3178.68 --> 3181.68
that's

3186.44 --> 3191.46
dude what the [ __ ] is this I'm still

3189.54 --> 3194.18
hearing some [ __ ] bass where the hell

3191.46 --> 3194.18
is that coming from

3199.74 --> 3202.74
foreign

3211.339 --> 3216.38
crap it might be somebody in the

3214.2 --> 3216.3799999999997
building

3217.68 --> 3221.819
it's really weird I don't hear it

3219.359 --> 3224.4
outside I hear it inside so I think some

3221.819 --> 3227.4
ass in the building is now playing live

3224.4 --> 3230.46
see that's the [ __ ] problem once some

3227.4 --> 3231.78
[ __ ] starts doing that

3230.46 --> 3234.18
yeah

3231.78 --> 3237.48
it starts to spread other people are

3234.18 --> 3239.46
like oh I want a little party too I'm

3237.48 --> 3241.64
gonna make a [ __ ] ton of noise now as

3239.46 --> 3241.64
well

3242.04 --> 3245.94
it's really annoying and that's why you

3244.02 --> 3248.339
should nip it in the bud quickly before

3245.94 --> 3251.04
other people get the idea

3248.339 --> 3253.859
same idea have you got a car I used to

3251.04 --> 3256.319
MTC mtrc

3253.859 --> 3259.0789999999997
don't anymore

3256.319 --> 3262.619
I do miss it though and yes I really

3259.079 --> 3263.46
liked playing music very loudly in my

3262.619 --> 3266.76
car

3263.46 --> 3270.18
but guess what I did not have a

3266.76 --> 3272.88
subwoofer and so with my windows rolled

3270.18 --> 3277.2599999999998
up I could put it louder than I would be

3272.88 --> 3279.9
comfortable with and nobody at like 10

3277.26 --> 3282.78
meters away from my car would even hear

3279.9 --> 3286.579
that there is music there yeah that's

3282.78 --> 3286.579
how I enjoy loud music

3286.92 --> 3292.5
because I don't enjoy loud music if I

3289.8 --> 3295.559
know it's bothering other people then I

3292.5 --> 3298.559
hate it makes me feel really

3295.559 --> 3298.559
disgusting

3316.319 --> 3321.54
how are you gonna help the base without

3318.359 --> 3324.72
a subwoofer well you just use the base

3321.54 --> 3326.4
I mean I don't have a subwoofer here and

3324.72 --> 3330.66
this

3326.4 --> 3332.579
like these little speakers they give

3330.66 --> 3335.2999999999997
plenty of Base

3332.579 --> 3335.3
I mean

3336.0 --> 3342.0
I can't have I even have a base dial on

3339.66 --> 3342.7799999999997
this thing so I can put the bass further

3342.0 --> 3345.599
up

3342.78 --> 3349.559
but it's base it's not breaking

3345.599 --> 3353.28
subwoofer I don't have to go vibrating

3349.559 --> 3356.94
because I don't need a vibrating massage

3353.28 --> 3359.579
because I I don't know how to manage my

3356.94 --> 3361.7400000000002
own stress I do know how to manage my

3359.579 --> 3363.98
own stress and I don't need that

3361.74 --> 3367.0789999999997
procedure

3363.98 --> 3369.2400000000002
which I tend to associate with being a

3367.079 --> 3371.8390000000004
[ __ ] because you can't deal with it in

3369.24 --> 3371.839

[Music]

3379.559 --> 3383.28
anyway

3381.42 --> 3385.319
are you all enjoying the show I feel a

3383.28 --> 3388.02
lot better right now I think I just had

3385.319 --> 3390.119
this on my heart also and I needed to

3388.02 --> 3395.22
just talk about it

3390.119 --> 3397.8
but I I think that my idea of the

3395.22 --> 3400.2
special

3397.8 --> 3402.2400000000002
car park Style

3400.2 --> 3404.5789999999997
sound proof

3402.24 --> 3407.22
zones

3404.579 --> 3408.96
for yeah for people in their cars that

3407.22 --> 3410.8799999999997
want to play really loud music and

3408.96 --> 3413.4
they're stupid subwoofers I think that

3410.88 --> 3415.98
would be a great solution as an

3413.4 --> 3418.6800000000003
alternative to just making subwoofers

3415.98 --> 3420.119
universally illegal

3418.68 --> 3422.339
yeah

3420.119 --> 3425.1600000000003
without special

3422.339 --> 3427.21
permits for having them because you're

3425.16 --> 3431.42
like in the music industry

3427.21 --> 3434.54
[Music]

3431.42 --> 3434.54
all right

3435.3 --> 3440.1600000000003
so yeah

3437.04 --> 3442.339
those are my ideas that's that's what I

3440.16 --> 3442.339
got

3443.16 --> 3447.44
I don't even know how to put that in the

3445.079 --> 3447.44
title

3465.0 --> 3471.3
the country doesn't know what

3468.42 --> 3475.5
no no they do actually then Winfield

3471.3 --> 3478.079
rich people in the country have [ __ ]

3475.5 --> 3481.02
with more or less expensive cars on

3478.079 --> 3483.559
average that do exactly the same thing

3481.02 --> 3483.559
right

3487.2 --> 3492.7799999999997
so no I mean yeah more people are

3490.859 --> 3494.52
bothered in cities

3492.78 --> 3496.92
because they're simply more people

3494.52 --> 3500.42
around to be bothered with it

3496.92 --> 3500.42
but in the country

3501.0 --> 3509.66
they have those same problems

3504.9 --> 3509.6600000000003
they have noise pollution as well

3509.96 --> 3517.079
actually like a lot of people in the

3513.42 --> 3520.079
country like farmer regions a lot of

3517.079 --> 3523.5
them actually like doing this

3520.079 --> 3528.3590000000004
they're hard workers a lot of them

3523.5 --> 3532.619
and they need their sound therapy

3528.359 --> 3535.2
to massage that [ __ ] out right that's

3532.619 --> 3538.04
actually a lot of like farmer types that

3535.2 --> 3538.04
also do this

3539.4 --> 3543.299
like especially in the east of our

3541.319 --> 3545.7599999999998
countries like they're kind of Infamous

3543.299 --> 3547.38
for that but there can be a good

3545.76 --> 3549.8390000000004
solution

3547.38 --> 3553.7400000000002
right I don't want to take their therapy

3549.839 --> 3557.0
away I just want to make it stop being a

3553.74 --> 3557.0
bother on everybody else

3561.059 --> 3566.3390000000004
beside to have animals make noise what

3564.48 --> 3568.02
yeah but that's not disturbing that's

3566.339 --> 3569.88
not gonna keep you awake then Winfield

3568.02 --> 3571.319
doesn't with me I mean there's chickens

3569.88 --> 3573.599
over there and they don't keep me awake

3571.319 --> 3575.64
even if I'd stay up very late and in the

3573.599 --> 3576.839
morning and I hear chickens I can still

3575.64 --> 3579.54
sleep

3576.839 --> 3582.319
I actually find it quite

3579.54 --> 3582.319
soothing

3582.72 --> 3585.74
animal sound

3591.72 --> 3597.54

Maybe

3643.5 --> 3647.46
what

3645.119 --> 3650.359
I have no idea Dan Winfield's first time

3647.46 --> 3650.359
I'm hearing about it

3652.079 --> 3656.48
it sounds like a a rumor

3662.22 --> 3667.02
thousand frogs chirp yeah okay but

3664.44 --> 3669.78
thousand frogs can be a little loud I

3667.02 --> 3672.18
have to agree LSG also because they they

3669.78 --> 3674.8190000000004
get louder when there's more they start

3672.18 --> 3678.359
louding it up to be the one heard right

3674.819 --> 3681.599
so yeah frogs lots of frogs together can

3678.359 --> 3684.119
become very loud yeah I agree there's

3681.599 --> 3686.54
limits I mean nature can keep you awake

game yeah subwoofer frogs would be

3865.14 --> 3870.359
pretty cool there's already like giant

3866.88 --> 3873.9
frogs that can swallow like Hobbits

3870.359 --> 3875.7
swallow a hole but you could have like a

3873.9 --> 3877.319
special version where they have like a

3875.7 --> 3879.48
Sonic attack so they're literally

3877.319 --> 3881.22
subwoofer frogs they're just gonna like

3879.48 --> 3886.94
rabbit and then if you come too close

3881.22 --> 3886.9399999999996
it's like you're just stand to fall over

3887.819 --> 3892.319
I mean

3890.04 --> 3894.299
I could actually see that

3892.319 --> 3896.22
in nature

3894.299 --> 3898.14
that something like that would be done

3896.22 --> 3900.0099999999998

crickets already freaking loud as they

3908.819 --> 3912.72
are

3910.26 --> 3916.619
it would make them explode

3912.72 --> 3918.839
well not if they're specifically built

3916.619 --> 3921.319
to be able to handle that type of

3918.839 --> 3921.319
vibration

3923.76 --> 3927.42
but then we're talking about giant frogs

3926.4 --> 3932.339
now

3927.42 --> 3934.799
like a frog that is like

3932.339 --> 3939.0589999999997
two meters tall

3934.799 --> 3941.88
yeah so not very realistic on Earth I

3939.059 --> 3942.92

hmm

4065.72 --> 4070.52
if you blew your back out

4067.78 --> 4072.38
all you really need to do is just take

4070.52 --> 4075.02
it easy and just

4072.38 --> 4077.78
minimize

4075.02 --> 4080.359

massage like that okay

4097.0 --> 4103.46

up tension over the day because you

4103.46 --> 4107.62
don't know how to express it or

4105.08 --> 4110.54
something you're just bottling it up

4107.62 --> 4112.88
that's what that releases it's not like

4110.54 --> 4116.299
oh my back is wrong or my muscles no no

4112.88 --> 4120.58
it's not that sort of therapy

4116.299 --> 4120.58
it has more to do with like your organs

4121.339 --> 4124.0599999999995

4124.46 --> 4128.14

constructive it's all just pure

4358.58 --> 4363.92
distraction to prevent themselves from

4361.28 --> 4366.44
getting getting it in their head that

4363.92 --> 4367.88
they're fundamentally wrong about their

4366.44 --> 4369.678999999999

they're not even helping out

just there to try to prevent themselves

4377.719 --> 4381.9800000000005

4380.42 --> 4383.4800000000005

4383.48 --> 4386.659
you're gonna learn something from it at

least

4386.659 --> 4391.58

you mean the Artemis no of course not

4410.96 --> 4415.4
it's never going to take off never

4415.94 --> 4420.44
I think that there's a bigger chance

4417.98 --> 4423.139999999999
that they're literally going to build a

4420.44 --> 4426.5599999999995

4423.14 --> 4429.14
the launch site with that rocket just

4426.56 --> 4430.88
sitting there

to show it off

4430.88 --> 4434.9800000000005
I think there's a bigger chance of that

4432.739 --> 4437.718999999999
than it actually coming off the ground

4434.98 --> 4439.099999999999
unless it is exploding but I I even

4437.719 --> 4441.38
doubt that I think it's just going to

4439.1 --> 4442.6990000000005
keep sitting there it's just never going

4441.38 --> 4444.25

we're going there but it never does it

is

4464.5 --> 4469.04

4467.12 --> 4471.199
just NE it's not even gonna explode

4469.04 --> 4473.239
they're just not gonna launch it it's

4471.199 --> 4476.178999999999
just gonna sit there

4473.239 --> 4477.44
forever or until dismantle but maybe

4476.179 --> 4479.06
they're not gonna do this now maybe

4477.44 --> 4481.46
they're just gonna have it like a piece

4479.06 --> 4483.5

maybe they'll build a museum around it

really mad Harry how does it do that

4634.34 --> 4637.54
really now

4647.739 --> 4653.78
it it doesn't actually explain

4651.8 --> 4656.679
perspective

4653.78 --> 4661.34
mad Harry because orthographic View

4656.679 --> 4665.96
naturally excludes perspective

4661.34 --> 4668.0
from what it is from that view

4665.96 --> 4671.36
yeah it's not a part of it perspective

4668.0 --> 4672.38
is not represented within orthographic

4671.36 --> 4675.5199999999995
View

4672.38 --> 4679.04
so to say orthographic View

4675.52 --> 4681.679
explains perspective is quite bizarre

4679.04 --> 4683.9
because it literally has nothing to do

4681.679 --> 4685.6990000000005
with it

4683.9 --> 4689.239
it's not a form of perspective

4685.699 --> 4693.08
perspective is perspective

4689.239 --> 4696.0199999999995
perspective is the only perspective

4693.08 --> 4698.84
yeah orthographic view is not another

4696.02 --> 4701.5
form of perspective it is orthographic

4698.84 --> 4705.76
view it's a

4701.5 --> 4710.36
geometric representation it's not visual

4705.76 --> 4711.8
in nature I mean there's visual markers

4710.36 --> 4714.199
right

4711.8 --> 4718.1
but those are more like measured markers

4714.199 --> 4721.04
with actual alleged actual distances Etc

4718.1 --> 4723.1990000000005
it's not perspective and it does not

4721.04 --> 4726.38
explain perspective I mean there is

4723.199 --> 4729.379999999999
orthographic diagrams that can sort of

4726.38 --> 4731.78
show you how the lens works and all that

4729.38 --> 4734.4400000000005
and that is shown in an orthographic

4731.78 --> 4734.44
little picture

4734.78 --> 4740.9
but that doesn't automatically make

4737.3 --> 4744.34
orthographic view explain perspective

4740.9 --> 4747.259999999999
you can potentially explain perspective

4744.34 --> 4750.04
using orthographic View to a limited

4747.26 --> 4752.900000000001
degree but orthographic Hue does not

4750.04 --> 4754.94
automatically explain perspective

4752.9 --> 4756.86
because it literally has nothing to do

4754.94 --> 4760.178999999999
with it

4756.86 --> 4760.179
it excludes it

4763.58 --> 4772.219
they say orthographic views

4766.76 --> 4773.719
really or they say oh they say of course

4772.219 --> 4776.12
yes

4773.719 --> 4778.719
well that's wrong because orthographic

4776.12 --> 4782.3
view is not perspective it excludes

4778.719 --> 4785.42
perspective specifically

4782.3 --> 4787.52
it's not a part of orthographic field

4814.3 --> 4820.400000000001
records sizes and distances yeah it's

4817.82 --> 4823.639999999999
not what meant to be what viewers see

4820.4 --> 4826.759999999999
yeah well what viewers see is

4823.64 --> 4829.280000000001
perspective based and indeed they don't

4826.76 --> 4831.08
so orthographic view has nothing to do

4829.28 --> 4833.9
with perspective which

4831.08 --> 4835.82
is basically contradicting what you said

4833.9 --> 4838.839999999999
earlier but hey

4835.82 --> 4838.84
you want to correct

4839.239 --> 4842.0199999999995
it's all good

4843.08 --> 4846.679
when you fact check yeah but I don't

4845.12 --> 4849.28
know where you fact yet but that's

4846.679 --> 4849.28
[ __ ]

4851.78 --> 4856.58
it's just wrong

4853.719 --> 4858.38
orthographic view does not have

4856.58 --> 4862.84
perspective

4858.38 --> 4862.84
it's not part of what it is

4862.94 --> 4870.639999999999
you you can't explain something

4866.84 --> 4870.64
if it's not a part of it

4873.32 --> 4878.44
yeah he did contradict himself literally

4875.96 --> 4878.44
he did

4886.4 --> 4890.86
it's right there in the chatakumu

4899.06 --> 4906.9400000000005
foreign

4901.54 --> 4906.94
used to work out can be used

4908.06 --> 4910.84
perhaps

4911.12 --> 4917.38
perhaps you could

4913.34 --> 4917.38
but it doesn't explain it though

4919.699 --> 4926.0
right but yeah you can

4922.82 --> 4928.48
try to use orthographic View

4926.0 --> 4934.179
to figure out an actual

4928.48 --> 4934.178999999999
visual picture and analyze it

4934.219 --> 4939.9800000000005
but it's not a perfect system mind you

4938.42 --> 4943.46
right

4939.98 --> 4947.44
and why would it be it it literally does

4943.46 --> 4947.44
not have perspective within it

4949.46 --> 4955.68
so yeah you can I mean

4952.67 --> 4955.68
[Music]

4956.54 --> 4963.92
there's a lot of things you can do

4959.6 --> 4968.42
right I mean you could use a lighter

4963.92 --> 4970.9400000000005
to write a message on a chalk wall

4968.42 --> 4972.5
does that mean that you should

4970.94 --> 4976.48
know

4972.5 --> 4976.48
does it prove anything no

4977.54 --> 4982.719
right

4978.86 --> 4982.719
but you could do it

4987.26 --> 4990.400000000001
this is pointless

[Music]

5011.199 --> 5013.799999999999
foreign

5015.42 --> 5020.02
representation that's right yeah I know

5017.86 --> 5021.5199999999995
orthographic view can be used to

5020.02 --> 5024.64
represent

5021.52 --> 5025.659000000001
yeah that doesn't mean that it explains

5024.64 --> 5027.04
it

5025.659 --> 5030.699
foreign

5027.04 --> 5030.699
[Music]

5045.179 --> 5051.64
the only real thing that explains

5049.48 --> 5053.099999999999
perspective

5051.64 --> 5057.52
is

5053.1 --> 5059.88
analyzing an actual visual picture right

5057.52 --> 5062.38
actual first person view

5059.88 --> 5065.02
[Music]

5062.38 --> 5067.92
you analyze it and then you explain

5065.02 --> 5071.14
what's going on there yeah

5067.92 --> 5073.42
that's much better to actually explain

5071.14 --> 5075.820000000001
perspective

5073.42 --> 5079.02
because it has perspective so you can

5075.82 --> 5079.0199999999995
literally point it out

5080.26 --> 5085.780000000001
yeah why the [ __ ] would you even want to

5083.08 --> 5090.0599999999995
point out how perspective Works using

5085.78 --> 5090.0599999999995
orthographic view it's a waste of time

5092.02 --> 5097.780000000001
just use actual view how about that

5094.96 --> 5100.96
first person view

5097.78 --> 5103.599999999999
and then analyze it yeah much better

5100.96 --> 5105.58
much more effective

5103.6 --> 5107.8
more straightforward more intuitive

5105.58 --> 5110.38
because that's literally how you see

5107.8 --> 5113.5
things yeah why the [ __ ] would you want

5110.38 --> 5115.96
to draw in orthographic view anyway

5113.5 --> 5118.96
could it be because then you could

5115.96 --> 5120.58
draw your stupid little ball again is

5118.96 --> 5122.38
that the reason because that's the only

5120.58 --> 5124.48
reason that I can think of why you would

5122.38 --> 5127.12
do that why the hell else would you use

5124.48 --> 5128.5599999999995
orthographic View

5127.12 --> 5130.96
because if you want to explain

5128.56 --> 5134.620000000001
perspective

5130.96 --> 5137.38
well you might want to utilize a

5134.62 --> 5139.72
representation of a visual that actually

5137.38 --> 5142.839
has perspective in it

5300.96 --> 5308.52
seems many comments don't show

5304.0 --> 5308.52
I don't see why George Sanford

5309.52 --> 5315.0
maybe there are certain subjects you

5311.62 --> 5315.0
just shouldn't be mentioning

5315.28 --> 5319.139
I have a couple of words banned

5327.88 --> 5337.06
[Music]

5332.52 --> 5339.88
what has been said that is anti-flatter

5337.06 --> 5340.900000000001
it's very simple the orthographic view

5339.88 --> 5343.12
thing

5340.9 --> 5345.28
that orthographic view explains

5343.12 --> 5347.679
perspective that's an anti-flatter thing

5345.28 --> 5350.32
to say

5347.679 --> 5352.659
yeah because the anti-flat earthers and

5350.32 --> 5354.88
globers but mostly anti-flat Earth is

5352.659 --> 5356.739
they want their autographic view because

5354.88 --> 5360.28
on that orthographic View

5356.739 --> 5364.718999999999
they can very easily replace perspective

5360.28 --> 5366.58
with supposed orthographic curvature

5364.719 --> 5369.34
there's a little tricksy for that and

5366.58 --> 5371.38
they want they want that that's why they

5369.34 --> 5373.6
keep pulling it back in

5371.38 --> 5375.6990000000005
right because orthographic view doesn't

5373.6 --> 5379.2390000000005
explain perspective

5375.699 --> 5382.419999999999
yeah perspective view explains

5379.239 --> 5384.699
perspective you look at it and then you

5382.42 --> 5386.679
can point it out to somebody that might

5384.699 --> 5389.5599999999995
not be super

5386.679 --> 5391.2390000000005
informed about it exactly what it is

5389.56 --> 5392.9800000000005
they're looking at like oh look at that

5391.239 --> 5394.419999999999
thing it's smaller right than they think

5392.98 --> 5395.638999999999
before that yes because it's further

5394.42 --> 5398.58
away

5395.639 --> 5402.58
you get the convergent line so it's just

5398.58 --> 5406.48
rudimentary teaching you use perspective

5402.58 --> 5412.08
view to teach people about perspective

5406.48 --> 5415.599999999999
yeah you don't use orthographic View

5412.08 --> 5418.5
that's anti-flatterther propaganda

[ __ ]

5432.6 --> 5438.9400000000005
no akumu virus no it isn't anti-flat

5437.139 --> 5442.0
earthers are anti-flat earthers you see

5438.94 --> 5444.28
globers just happen to think yeah the

5442.0 --> 5446.62
Earth is a globe whatever

5444.28 --> 5448.54
they're not gonna say yeah of course we

5446.62 --> 5450.5199999999995
learn perspective we learn about

5448.54 --> 5453.58
perspective through artographic view

5450.52 --> 5455.92
because they're not [ __ ] retards or

5453.58 --> 5459.88
political Liars

5455.92 --> 5463.08
yeah like anti-flat earthers

5459.88 --> 5466.84
yeah they're not standard scumbags

5463.08 --> 5469.96
they'll maneuver whatever they can to

5466.84 --> 5471.96
somehow get some micro Advantage every

5469.96 --> 5475.06
single time yeah

5471.96 --> 5477.88
architectural maneuvering of Lies yeah

5475.06 --> 5481.4800000000005
globers don't do that anti-flat earthers

5477.88 --> 5484.6
do yeah and and this is one of them

5481.48 --> 5486.94
yeah you don't need artographic view to

5484.6 --> 5490.120000000001
explain perspective that's not how it's

5486.94 --> 5494.08
taught nobody was taught about

5490.12 --> 5497.679
perspective using artographic View

5494.08 --> 5499.78
you were shown perspective View and then

5497.679 --> 5501.76
you get to analyze then you get to know

5499.78 --> 5504.04
about how it works you don't use

5501.76 --> 5507.3
orthographic view yeah

5504.04 --> 5507.3

5532.06 --> 5534.659000000001
up teacher

5534.88 --> 5539.82
because you don't need

5536.86 --> 5542.739
orthographic view doesn't help explain

5539.82 --> 5545.5199999999995
anything about perspective because it

5542.739 --> 5545.5199999999995
excludes it

5545.92 --> 5550.12
you have no reason to lie well not that

5547.9 --> 5552.94
you're aware of

5550.12 --> 5554.199
right I know you can compartmentalize

5552.94 --> 5556.78
that [ __ ]

5554.199 --> 5558.759999999999
so you saying I have no reason to lie

5556.78 --> 5560.44
for well yeah that's what your

5558.76 --> 5562.780000000001

5560.44 --> 5565.98
because it's so easy

5562.78 --> 5565.98
to say that right

now you do have a reason to lie to

5573.88 --> 5578.9800000000005
double down on what you said before

5575.56 --> 5581.620000000001

hard [ __ ]

5588.58 --> 5592.6
yeah didn't have no reason to like yeah

5591.219 --> 5594.52
you do

you're an anti-flat earther and you have

5594.52 --> 5598.3
a lot of reason to lie continually

5971.739 --> 5978.759999999999
it was made in in a place in China oh oh

5976.3 --> 5982.659000000001
yes no no there is literally nothing

5978.76 --> 5987.159000000001
it's all made up [ __ ] every part of it

5982.659 --> 5991.839999999999
is made up [ __ ] yeah viruses don't even

5987.159 --> 5994.48
exist yeah literally in any form like

5991.84 --> 5997.84
the entire concept of viruses is

5994.48 --> 6001.259999999999
complete made up hogwash

5997.84 --> 6003.9800000000005
it does not exist

6001.26 --> 6003.9800000000005
fact

6004.679 --> 6011.159
so anything you say about oh where do

6008.1 --> 6015.06
did it what where it's all horseshit

6011.159 --> 6018.96
it's all theater it's all the plants the

6015.06 --> 6021.780000000001
desperate wanting you to believe that

6018.96 --> 6024.54
there is something that is real that is

6021.78 --> 6026.759999999999
the spell the spell is to make you

6024.54 --> 6028.08
believe that there actually is something

6026.76 --> 6031.8
real there

6028.08 --> 6033.48
it isn't it's all social engineering

6031.8 --> 6036.06
[ __ ]

6033.48 --> 6039.36
yeah all of it

6036.06 --> 6041.88
it's made up it's Science Fiction it's

6039.36 --> 6044.12
not proven that viruses exist in any

6041.88 --> 6044.12
form

6044.639 --> 6050.28
so they just call things a virus usually

6048.6 --> 6053.400000000001
when they cannot find a more

6050.28 --> 6054.96
straightforward reason as to why it is

6053.4 --> 6058.32
the way it is

6054.96 --> 6060.9
because yeah there's these axis ohms

6058.32 --> 6062.82
which is like a little byproduct of the

6060.9 --> 6065.879999999999
body

6062.82 --> 6067.92
that helps clean up things when you get

6065.88 --> 6070.02
in like a pretty bad State when your

6067.92 --> 6072.54
condition goes pretty bad then they come

6070.02 --> 6074.76
out and they help fix things yeah come

6072.54 --> 6077.219
out of your body where they come from

6074.76 --> 6079.26
because your body made them specifically

6077.219 --> 6082.44
to do that because they're part of your

6079.26 --> 6085.92
body's infrastructure they're part of

6082.44 --> 6088.739
your body yeah it's not a virus

6085.92 --> 6091.38
a virus is a concept that was basically

6088.739 --> 6093.5599999999995
put on top of that so it's a

6091.38 --> 6097.26
misidentification

6093.56 --> 6099.659000000001
continual Perpetual misidentification of

6097.26 --> 6101.76
what actually goes on in the body and

6099.659 --> 6104.4
then models made with it

6101.76 --> 6107.400000000001
based on fear porn like it's a danger

6104.4 --> 6111.0
that's a micro particle would come unto

6107.4 --> 6113.04
you it isn't it's a complete [ __ ]

6111.0 --> 6116.58
nonsense

6113.04 --> 6119.4
there is organic material flying

6116.58 --> 6121.32
everywhere around you all the time of

6119.4 --> 6124.739
all kinds of animals other people

6121.32 --> 6127.94
everything there's literal organic

6124.739 --> 6130.739
particulates everywhere

6127.94 --> 6133.678999999999
everywhere you're breathing it it's on

6130.739 --> 6136.5
you it's in you everywhere yeah

6133.679 --> 6139.32
this notion that there could be the

6136.5 --> 6141.06
ultimate particle of some kind and it

6139.32 --> 6143.58
touches down and you it gets in you and

6141.06 --> 6147.719
then it starts to multiply and you get

6143.58 --> 6150.0599999999995
sick is a [ __ ] myth it's a myth it

6147.719 --> 6153.2390000000005
doesn't happen it's never been proven to

6150.06 --> 6155.6
happen it can't happen it's not how it

6153.239 --> 6155.599999999999
works

6156.48 --> 6161.58
yeah

6158.46 --> 6164.699
it's all horseshit

6161.58 --> 6166.619
always was harsh [ __ ] it's just a fair

6164.699 --> 6169.0199999999995
porn it's just like the atom bomb

6166.619 --> 6174.179
nonsense it's there to make you really

6169.02 --> 6176.9400000000005
really scared and disengage figuring out

6174.179 --> 6181.679
what's happening because it's too scary

6176.94 --> 6187.5599999999995
yeah that's what it's there for

6181.679 --> 6190.02
to scare you in discontinuing inquiry

6187.56 --> 6194.1
that's what it exists for

6190.02 --> 6197.159000000001
to distract you from what it is covering

6194.1 --> 6198.679
up like the situation underneath it

6197.159 --> 6202.679
the corruption

6198.679 --> 6204.659
conspiracy like known admitted in the

6202.679 --> 6207.06
open conspiracies that are illegal

6204.659 --> 6208.679
illegal actions that are not being

6207.06 --> 6211.4400000000005
punished

6208.679 --> 6213.3
by government people yeah all of that

6211.44 --> 6217.08
sort of [ __ ] that's what it's the cover

6213.3 --> 6220.679
for to let the real virus

6217.08 --> 6224.219
which is the wef agenda

6220.679 --> 6227.04
and a bunch of stinky snobs with way too

6224.219 --> 6229.26
much money and no soul yeah that's the

6227.04 --> 6231.179
real virus

6229.26 --> 6234.3
that's the the thing that's actually

6231.179 --> 6238.86
infecting yeah the society is being

6234.3 --> 6242.159000000001
infected by people that are like viruses

6238.86 --> 6244.139
the the idea of the virus because actual

6242.159 --> 6248.638999999999
viruses don't exist but the idea

6244.139 --> 6252.56
infiltrate take over destroy yeah

6248.639 --> 6256.38
that's that's what humans can do

6252.56 --> 6259.26
infiltrators traitors marxists

6256.38 --> 6260.9400000000005
they're the real virus the only real

6259.26 --> 6264.360000000001
virus

6260.94 --> 6266.28
because in biology there is no virus it

6264.36 --> 6268.199
doesn't exist it's a concept

6266.28 --> 6273.599999999999
heavily promoted by science fiction

6268.199 --> 6274.66
never backed by actual scientific fact

6273.6 --> 6280.43
done

6274.66 --> 6280.43
[Music]

6283.57 --> 6289.5599999999995
[Music]

6286.56 --> 6289.56
ah

6292.56 --> 6297.42
some of your [ __ ] business why'd you

6294.9 --> 6300.78
pay attention [ __ ]

6297.42 --> 6303.56
get the [ __ ] out of my chat

6300.78 --> 6303.5599999999995
wanker

6307.139 --> 6311.9400000000005
yeah German new medicine but that's just

6309.3 --> 6313.5
a tiny fragment of it there's so much

6311.94 --> 6315.48
information

6313.5 --> 6317.52
I don't have a grasp on all that

6315.48 --> 6321.299999999999
information but I have been exposed and

6317.52 --> 6324.360000000001
I counted uh I gathered a lot of

6321.3 --> 6326.6990000000005
metadata spiritual metadata but the

6324.36 --> 6329.46
people that do it I learned a lot about

6326.699 --> 6331.138999999999
what it actually is to be a doctor out

6329.46 --> 6333.4800000000005
there

6331.139 --> 6335.76
right what these people are like on the

6333.48 --> 6337.259999999999
inside what they are conflicted about

6335.76 --> 6341.900000000001
what they have to deal with with

6337.26 --> 6346.400000000001
colleagues and spiritual plagues of evil

6341.9 --> 6346.4
among colleagues and [ __ ]

6348.36 --> 6353.239
yeah if only akumu virus if only

6360.659 --> 6366.0
all right but there's many different

6362.46 --> 6368.4
directions you can look at to fill out

6366.0 --> 6370.679
the void of the concept of a virus and

6368.4 --> 6374.48
that's German new medicine

6370.679 --> 6374.4800000000005
it's terrain Theory

6375.0 --> 6379.86
well that'll pretty much cover most of

6378.06 --> 6381.96
it

6379.86 --> 6384.119
but yeah it's

6381.96 --> 6386.46
kind of alien

6384.119 --> 6388.139
I mean if you've never seen German new

6386.46 --> 6389.28
medicine you'll be like what the hell is

6388.139 --> 6391.9800000000005
this

6389.28 --> 6395.159
it's so different it's completely

6391.98 --> 6396.299999999999
another world compared to allopathic

6395.159 --> 6400.98
medicine

6396.3 --> 6405.92
so end Homeopathy yeah

6400.98 --> 6405.919999999999
maybe I'm not sure about homeopathy

6413.159 --> 6417.42
I mean if you're like a specialist in

6415.5 --> 6420.3
that then I bet you could do a lot of

6417.42 --> 6422.58
good but as a general form of medical

6420.3 --> 6424.8
practice I don't know about Homeopathy

6422.58 --> 6427.32
too much

6424.8 --> 6429.719
I mean yeah

6427.32 --> 6432.239
you are yeah you're called classical

6429.719 --> 6434.76
homeopath so I take that you understand

6432.239 --> 6436.919999999999
that homeopathy

6434.76 --> 6439.92
or if you're really specialized in it I

6436.92 --> 6443.2390000000005
bet you could do some good with it

6439.92 --> 6443.2390000000005
I'm just not a fan

6451.98 --> 6457.138999999999
but I'm not gonna like crack down on it

6454.98 --> 6459.619
either so I'm kind of neutral about it

6457.139 --> 6459.619
right

6459.92 --> 6466.679
foreign

6462.679 --> 6470.06
about however is freaking vaccination

6466.679 --> 6473.219
which is technically classified under

6470.06 --> 6477.2390000000005
virology and allopathic Medical Practice

6473.219 --> 6480.6
right now that part I am absolutely shut

6477.239 --> 6482.638999999999
it down shut it down

6480.6 --> 6485.820000000001
yeah

6482.639 --> 6488.28
freaking vaccine Laboratories shut it

6485.82 --> 6490.0199999999995
down shut down production of that sort

6488.28 --> 6492.3
of thing entirely

6490.02 --> 6495.119000000001
there's better ways to spend resources

6492.3 --> 6498.5
than concocting poison to make people

6495.119 --> 6498.5
[ __ ] and dead

6505.159 --> 6511.619
food is medicine yeah very wise yeah of

6508.5 --> 6514.88
course I mean know what you eat

6511.619 --> 6514.88
know what's in the food

6519.8 --> 6526.860000000001
right and try to bypass standard food

6523.86 --> 6529.38
advice like that is official food advice

6526.86 --> 6532.0199999999995
like the food pyramid is complete

6529.38 --> 6533.9400000000005
horseshit

6532.02 --> 6537.06
and there's all kinds of myths like oh

6533.94 --> 6538.619
no don't use salt what the [ __ ] you mean

6537.06 --> 6540.900000000001
now you salt

6538.619 --> 6542.699
give me the salt I just don't want

6540.9 --> 6544.98
refined salt I want

6542.699 --> 6549.178999999999
complete salt with minerals and

6544.98 --> 6552.54
everything like Himalayan sea salt or

6549.179 --> 6556.1990000000005
because the Celtic seesaw

6552.54 --> 6558.659
from like Normandy right that's good and

6556.199 --> 6561.0
I like it give me more salt right so

6558.659 --> 6563.94
that's like a myth like [ __ ] you it's

6561.0 --> 6566.1
[ __ ] I mean some people like really

6563.94 --> 6568.44
don't take salt well for some reason but

6566.1 --> 6571.9800000000005
that's like a few people

6568.44 --> 6574.46
I am great with salsa it's just [ __ ]

6571.98 --> 6580.86
who knew it's meant for your heart even

6574.46 --> 6584.82
no no it isn't like no no it isn't salt

6580.86 --> 6587.339999999999
bad for me no it isn't it's not bad for

6584.82 --> 6589.199
my heart like even my kidneys are kind

6587.34 --> 6593.219
of okay with it even when I get

6589.199 --> 6595.44
excessive okay when I eat like two rolls

6593.219 --> 6597.719
of lacres salt like straight in a row

6595.44 --> 6600.719
normal people that are not used to Salt

6597.719 --> 6602.94
would probably get really sick from that

6600.719 --> 6606.2390000000005
I have no problem with it

6602.94 --> 6608.638999999999
at all like at all I don't it doesn't

6606.239 --> 6611.94
even nauseate me anymore

6608.639 --> 6614.219
when that happens also I eat a lot of

6611.94 --> 6618.0599999999995
fat

6614.219 --> 6620.04
yeah but I'm very picky about which fats

6618.06 --> 6622.320000000001
I actually use

6620.04 --> 6625.139
very very picky

6622.32 --> 6628.0199999999995
so I like fried

6625.139 --> 6629.6990000000005
fries right fries

6628.02 --> 6634.8
ripe potatoes

6629.699 --> 6637.199
I use olive oil organic olive oil works

6634.8 --> 6640.58
great if I use anything else it would

6637.199 --> 6644.219
suck if I'd use like uh

6640.58 --> 6646.5599999999995
sunflower oil I'd literally get [ __ ]

6644.219 --> 6649.38
sounds weird right what's the difference

6646.56 --> 6653.159000000001
well the difference is that when you fry

6649.38 --> 6655.92
fries in sunflower oil the fat is

6653.159 --> 6658.92
different and when I then eat it I

6655.92 --> 6660.96
literally start to get numb in my head

6658.92 --> 6663.719
literally

6660.96 --> 6666.6
I tried it like twice a few years ago

6663.719 --> 6668.699
and I had this whole thing with that oil

6666.6 --> 6672.139
and it just like [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm

6668.699 --> 6672.138999999999
never using that ever again

6674.219 --> 6679.58
fried meat is better for you than fruits

6677.04 --> 6679.58
okay

6681.119 --> 6685.5199999999995
whatever

6682.32 --> 6685.5199999999995
I I like fat

6686.1 --> 6692.46
fat is good for me I like like good

6689.639 --> 6694.32
quality butter

6692.46 --> 6698.76
olive oil

6694.32 --> 6702.659
and I like fat on meat

6698.76 --> 6704.58
I like it when it just has good fat

6702.659 --> 6706.138999999999
which is kind of weird because when I

6704.58 --> 6707.82
was a kid I would always used to avoid

6706.139 --> 6709.38
it because of the texture I don't like

6707.82 --> 6712.259999999999
the texture of like

6709.38 --> 6714.719
baked fat and all that but when animal

6712.26 --> 6716.58
fat but it's actually really healthy so

6714.719 --> 6718.8
I just forced myself to eat it now

6716.58 --> 6721.08
because I know like that's really good

6718.8 --> 6724.56
for my body might not like the texture

6721.08 --> 6729.629
but screw that I'm gonna eat that

6724.56 --> 6729.629000000001
[Music]

6731.88 --> 6737.96
all right anyway probably making you

6735.119 --> 6737.96
hungry right now

6738.54 --> 6743.219
I did just say again

6740.699 --> 6746.04
we were talking about like real medicine

6743.219 --> 6748.86
or health tips

6746.04 --> 6751.44
food very important and also to realize

6748.86 --> 6753.599999999999
like what does your body actually need

6751.44 --> 6755.4
don't just conform to some stupid

6753.6 --> 6759.38
government standard of what you're

6755.4 --> 6759.379999999999
supposed to have because it's [ __ ]

6759.719 --> 6763.159
they don't know anything

6763.56 --> 6769.8
like actual dietary like Diet people

6767.159 --> 6771.54
that are like specialists in that they

6769.8 --> 6775.08
know you have to adapt the diet

6771.54 --> 6777.42
specifically to the individual and like

6775.08 --> 6778.5
well the genetic background effectively

6777.42 --> 6780.54
like

6778.5 --> 6783.84
for example

6780.54 --> 6786.3
the average person from India is not

6783.84 --> 6787.8
going to do well with milk

6786.3 --> 6790.38
right

6787.8 --> 6791.9400000000005
on average so

6790.38 --> 6794.88
they don't

6791.94 --> 6796.44
they shouldn't be then forced to drink

6794.88 --> 6798.719
that because they're told yeah you have

6796.44 --> 6800.4
to do that because it's in a stupid food

6798.719 --> 6801.2390000000005
pyramid because it's not good for them

6800.4 --> 6804.0
right

6801.239 --> 6806.218999999999
that well that's just one rudimentary

6804.0 --> 6807.659
and it's full of that [ __ ] right what

6806.219 --> 6811.08
they say about what you're supposed to

6807.659 --> 6813.78
eat or not you should completely shove

6811.08 --> 6816.719
that in the trash can and start to

6813.78 --> 6818.34
actually figure it out also through your

6816.719 --> 6821.84
own intuition

6818.34 --> 6826.139
right so one of these

6821.84 --> 6829.08
counter intuitive little trixies that

6826.139 --> 6831.54
they have the industry is to say oh

6829.08 --> 6835.5599999999995
you're fat you're fat that means you eat

6831.54 --> 6838.88
too much fat you have to go diet oh yes

6835.56 --> 6838.88
well guess what

6839.58 --> 6845.699
you know what what's usually the best to

6843.119 --> 6847.5599999999995
get rid of your fat

6845.699 --> 6849.9
fat

6847.56 --> 6852.6
because why do you build fat why are you

6849.9 --> 6855.98
bloated with that for example or see you

6852.6 --> 6860.9400000000005
seem bloated well it's because fat

6855.98 --> 6863.5199999999995
is like not just there being like too

6860.94 --> 6866.339999999999
much why does your body Heap up fat well

6863.52 --> 6870.780000000001
it's usually to kind of store

6866.34 --> 6873.26
fat soluble poisons that are just in the

6870.78 --> 6876.84
food in the environment that you get in

6873.26 --> 6880.92
usually unhealthy food has bad fats

6876.84 --> 6883.02
those fats then start getting stored in

6880.92 --> 6885.54
your body because your system cannot

6883.02 --> 6889.080000000001
process it your liver

6885.54 --> 6892.139
and now yeah what is it

6889.08 --> 6894.119
the other organs right it's like it's

6892.139 --> 6897.179
too much there's too much toxins they

6894.119 --> 6900.239
can't afford to even get rid of that fat

6897.179 --> 6903.2390000000005
in your body because then they it would

6900.239 --> 6905.94
also expose your body to the toxins that

6903.239 --> 6909.419999999999
were stored in that fat as like an

6905.94 --> 6912.48
emergency storage system right

6909.42 --> 6915.119
so the idea oh you're bloated eat less

6912.48 --> 6916.799999999999
fat well that might actually make it

6915.119 --> 6920.4
worse

6916.8 --> 6923.52
what you should do is start really

6920.4 --> 6927.179
paying attention getting getting away

6923.52 --> 6928.040000000001
from really disgusting types of bad fats

6927.179 --> 6931.38
like

6928.04 --> 6933.36
Magnum ice cream [ __ ] right this is a

6931.38 --> 6934.139
stick of butter but the worst kind of

6933.36 --> 6940.679
butter

6934.139 --> 6943.32
right never ever eat those ever ever

6940.679 --> 6947.1
if you see a freaking Magnum smash it

6943.32 --> 6949.38
it's evil it's poison it will make you

6947.1 --> 6951.719
fat

6949.38 --> 6952.9800000000005
yeah that's the bad fat

6951.719 --> 6956.28
but

6952.98 --> 6959.419999999999
eat good fat leave the bad fat eat good

6956.28 --> 6961.86
fat eat good organic butter

6959.42 --> 6965.46
organic Meats

6961.86 --> 6968.099999999999
and be very careful to avoid the bad

6965.46 --> 6970.5
fats now if you start eating like this

6968.1 --> 6972.659000000001
guess what's gonna happen

6970.5 --> 6976.92
you're gonna sleep down

6972.659 --> 6981.0
why because suddenly you get less fat

6976.92 --> 6983.88
soluble toxins in your system and good

6981.0 --> 6986.639
fats so what happens then well the good

6983.88 --> 6989.34
fats will help your body actually get

6986.639 --> 6991.7390000000005
rid of the toxic fats it has something

6989.34 --> 6994.619000000001
to replace it with and now all that

6991.739 --> 6998.28
garbage certainly

6994.619 --> 7001.5199999999995
starts to go away it will slink you down

6998.28 --> 7005.0599999999995
yeah eating good organic fats

7001.52 --> 7007.52
with Consciousness you can't just shove

7005.06 --> 7009.8
[ __ ] in your face anymore you have to

7007.52 --> 7010.76
stop that forever

7009.8 --> 7013.820000000001
right

7010.76 --> 7019.659000000001
take care of your food eat good fats and

7013.82 --> 7019.659
it will slink you down it will

7020.619 --> 7029.839999999999
yeah that's why I've never

7024.92 --> 7031.52
seen a bloated fat person in an organic

7029.84 --> 7033.56
supermarket

7031.52 --> 7035.659000000001
I mean they might be like the first few

7033.56 --> 7037.04
times they come there but eventually if

7035.659 --> 7038.96
they're like you know I'm real this is

7037.04 --> 7041.48
going to be my Supermarket now they're

7038.96 --> 7043.46
gonna slink they're gonna turn to more

7041.48 --> 7045.5599999999995
normal size I mean

7043.46 --> 7047.0
you're not gonna turn into a supermodel

7045.56 --> 7050.080000000001
doing this

7047.0 --> 7050.08
it's a lot more work

7050.239 --> 7055.4
so really worth it

7051.8 --> 7058.820000000001
but you don't have to be like a meatball

7055.4 --> 7062.199
or a boulder you could be a little

7058.82 --> 7066.639
chubby instead and feel a lot healthier

7062.199 --> 7066.638999999999
yeah less tired

7066.679 --> 7071.78
all you need to do is just get rid of

7069.08 --> 7074.719
bad fats and that's not a universal it's

7071.78 --> 7077.54
specific products specific mainstream

7074.719 --> 7082.04
products that have fat in them yet are

7077.54 --> 7084.86
not healthy and then eat healthy fats

7082.04 --> 7089.0199999999995
only make sure that you never eat

7084.86 --> 7089.0199999999995
anything that is fat that isn't organic

7089.54 --> 7095.3
and in it universally stay away from

7092.8 --> 7097.58
pre-packaged Foods

7095.3 --> 7099.619000000001
things like cookies

7097.58 --> 7101.599
as well

7099.619 --> 7103.5199999999995
it will help

7101.599 --> 7106.76
it will slink you down you'll feel

7103.52 --> 7109.580000000001
you'll be less bloaty you'll have more

7106.76 --> 7112.400000000001
energy you'll have more clarity of mind

7109.58 --> 7115.88
because hey your brain

7112.4 --> 7119.0
is a lot of fat actually it's like 90 or

7115.88 --> 7121.88
more it's fat so yeah if you have bad

7119.0 --> 7124.88
fats in your system that's also going to

7121.88 --> 7128.36
burden your brain not just build a fat

7124.88 --> 7131.54
layers yeah so all those good fats are

7128.36 --> 7135.259999999999
really important

7131.54 --> 7138.8
yet on the food pyramid that is all the

7135.26 --> 7140.599
way down there yes oh

7138.8 --> 7144.02
of course

7140.599 --> 7145.88
don't eat fats it's a luxury

7144.02 --> 7149.3
unless you actually want to be a

7145.88 --> 7153.28
competent slim smart person

7149.3 --> 7153.28
and then fat is really important

7155.0 --> 7157.42
right

7160.42 --> 7163.619
[Music]

7165.699 --> 7169.638999999999
foreign

7167.56 --> 7173.139
so there we go

7169.639 --> 7173.139
little food advice

7182.0 --> 7186.099
yeah correct steamy Traveler

7196.119 --> 7203.0199999999995
constantly overeating

7198.34 --> 7203.02
okay well Como virus I don't know

7203.9 --> 7209.239
well look if you're just gonna eat

7207.02 --> 7211.280000000001
yourself the death kind of situation

7209.239 --> 7213.919999999999
just keep shoving and shoving and if

7211.28 --> 7216.679
you're like a compulsive

7213.92 --> 7218.84
eater yeah then even if you go to

7216.679 --> 7221.659
organic food stores then you'll still

7218.84 --> 7225.159000000001
get fat I mean if you just overeat

7221.659 --> 7225.159
yeah then you'll get fat

7228.98 --> 7233.48
but I don't know since I started eating

7231.56 --> 7235.46
organic which is now

7233.48 --> 7238.159
a long time ago

7235.46 --> 7239.54
it's almost two decades

7238.159 --> 7242.48
right

7239.54 --> 7244.699
when I ate before that I ate more I

7242.48 --> 7247.04
stuffed myself

7244.699 --> 7250.58
quite a bit since I started eating

7247.04 --> 7253.34
organic I eat half of what I used to

7250.58 --> 7256.28
yet I'm feeling better

7253.34 --> 7259.42
more satisfied and a lot more healthy

7256.28 --> 7259.42
compared to before

7259.46 --> 7264.32
so

7261.08 --> 7266.719
yeah but hey if you insist if you if you

7264.32 --> 7269.239
have the freaking money to like spend

7266.719 --> 7271.52
two hundred dollars every time you go to

7269.239 --> 7273.86
a supermarket to get a car full of stuff

7271.52 --> 7275.84
and you shove it all out yeah if you

7273.86 --> 7278.54
have a lot of money to spend on organic

7275.84 --> 7280.52
food you can still fatten yourself up I

7278.54 --> 7281.719
mean if you just overeat then you'll get

7280.52 --> 7284.84
fat anyway

7281.719 --> 7287.78
right but that's not what I was talking

7284.84 --> 7291.38
about specifically

7287.78 --> 7293.48
on average you don't see like really

7291.38 --> 7295.84
bloaty fat people in organic

7293.48 --> 7299.718999999999
supermarkets because if they shop there

7295.84 --> 7302.3
they will eventually start slinking down

7299.719 --> 7304.84
like even if they don't diet that will

7302.3 --> 7304.84
just happen

7306.47 --> 7316.229
[Music]

7317.3 --> 7324.88
okay as well I'll know what you'll be

7320.06 --> 7324.88
looking like when you're 60. then

7327.38 --> 7333.219
because yeah that metabolism

7330.08 --> 7333.219
good luck with that

7335.38 --> 7343.719
that stuff kind of starts to run out

7338.179 --> 7343.719
after 30. so good luck anyway

7346.639 --> 7350.119
process that yeah steamy travel I know

7348.8 --> 7353.54
it's terrible stuff

7350.119 --> 7356.54
I avoid that sort of stuff

7353.54 --> 7356.54
foreign

7363.56 --> 7366.56
like

7368.54 --> 7373.34
even like organic cookies that are

7371.179 --> 7374.599
really well made in the organic

7373.34 --> 7377.659000000001
supermarket

7374.599 --> 7380.06
like I cannot really handle them

7377.659 --> 7382.82
like if I eat it like an entire package

7380.06 --> 7385.34
that I will get sick

7382.82 --> 7389.119
now can you imagine what would happen if

7385.34 --> 7392.119000000001
I would like get Walmart cookies

7389.119 --> 7395.36
and stuff myself that I would get really

7392.119 --> 7397.5199999999995
sick then I mean I could like

7395.36 --> 7398.78
I don't want to speculate about it it's

7397.52 --> 7400.88
never going to happen

7398.78 --> 7404.119
right

7400.88 --> 7407.78
so yeah process types of foods even

7404.119 --> 7409.639
organic are not really great any form of

7407.78 --> 7411.86
processed food is not great it's just

7409.639 --> 7415.58
that the organic version is going to be

7411.86 --> 7417.739
slightly less detrimental it will be

7415.58 --> 7419.719
okay not great

7417.739 --> 7423.619
if you really want the healthy food you

7419.719 --> 7427.4800000000005
got to make it yourself every part of it

7423.619 --> 7427.48
or as many parts as you can

7431.52 --> 7435.889
[Music]

7444.199 --> 7449.0199999999995
anyway yeah show has been all over the

7446.599 --> 7449.02
place today

7451.219 --> 7454.219
viruses

7455.0 --> 7458.0
food

7465.679 --> 7471.08
I certainly do feel a lot better right

7467.78 --> 7473.8
now than when I started the show

7471.08 --> 7473.8
so that's good

7480.92 --> 7486.1990000000005
yeah aspartame yeah we talked about

7483.199 --> 7488.598999999999
aspartame was it two days ago

7486.199 --> 7491.86
I had I have a show with a title in that

7488.599 --> 7491.860000000001
from last week

7492.619 --> 7495.339999999999
so yeah

7496.46 --> 7499.78
to borrow ing okay

7518.239 --> 7522.98
right but anyway yeah

7521.06 --> 7525.4400000000005
there

7522.98 --> 7527.659
I think I'm gonna round out the show

7525.44 --> 7528.98
but that certainly did fly by in the

7527.659 --> 7531.879999999999
last

7528.98 --> 7531.879999999999
three quarters

7532.54 --> 7537.44
hopefully I'll just have like a good

7535.159 --> 7541.299999999999
night rest this time

7537.44 --> 7541.299999999999
and then I'll be really fresh tomorrow

7552.619 --> 7556.839999999999
all right so I hope you guys enjoyed the

7554.599 --> 7556.84
show

7558.86 --> 7562.699
what's for dinner tonight nothing

7561.56 --> 7566.84
special

7562.699 --> 7569.48
probably french fries maybe a hamburger

7566.84 --> 7573.08
not sure yet

7569.48 --> 7576.199
I mean I don't even eat that much

7573.08 --> 7578.719
like a full dinner type meal

7576.199 --> 7582.44
I usually like have

7578.719 --> 7585.92
two or three times a week Max

7582.44 --> 7588.58
most of the time I just settle with like

7585.92 --> 7588.58
lunch

7589.219 --> 7595.82
and french fries and that's usually it

7592.82 --> 7598.58
I mean I should eat more vegetables I do

7595.82 --> 7600.5599999999995
realize that but

7598.58 --> 7602.48
I don't have that many full dinners and

7600.56 --> 7605.4800000000005
I'm doing just fine now on the other

7602.48 --> 7608.0
hand I also use supplements so that

7605.48 --> 7610.159
might be part of that

7608.0 --> 7612.38
why I don't feel like I need to have

7610.159 --> 7614.42
like a full dinner every day

7612.38 --> 7616.219
but

7614.42 --> 7618.46
yeah it seems to be working out just

7616.219 --> 7618.46
fine

7619.239 --> 7622.299999999999
thank you

7624.02 --> 7631.639
more greens yeah yeah

7627.139 --> 7635.3
especially lettuce I mean I like lettuce

7631.639 --> 7638.900000000001
why almost exactly like the picture

7635.3 --> 7642.38
the emoticon you pull out there

7638.9 --> 7643.638999999999
so yeah I have like this little gem

7642.38 --> 7645.56
lattice

7643.639 --> 7647.900000000001
and you could just break off a couple of

7645.56 --> 7650.3
leaves and chew them down it's great

7647.9 --> 7652.879999999999
it stays fresh for quite long quite a

7650.3 --> 7655.219
long time so that's like a good solution

7652.88 --> 7656.719
solution to get some greens that's I had

7655.219 --> 7658.88
that yesterday too it's like french

7656.719 --> 7662.36
fries but then I felt like I need some

7658.88 --> 7664.400000000001
kind of lettuce I just took a couple of

7662.36 --> 7666.86
leaves

7664.4 --> 7669.259999999999
wash them off and then just chew them

7666.86 --> 7671.9
down just like that before french fries

7669.26 --> 7673.46
it was a good decision

7671.9 --> 7675.739
but I got it

7673.46 --> 7677.9800000000005
yeah I gotta keep my mind packed on that

7675.739 --> 7681.98
like don't forget the greens

7677.98 --> 7684.0199999999995
I I I'm the real guy man I guess like

7681.98 --> 7686.709999999999
that I really like greens it's just that

7684.02 --> 7688.400000000001
