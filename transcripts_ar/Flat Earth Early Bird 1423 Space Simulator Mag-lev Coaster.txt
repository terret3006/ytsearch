super clear as yesterday but

108.72 --> 112.46
still a bit of sun

112.92 --> 118.64
and some blue in between the hazy like

116.04 --> 118.64
clouds

121.72 --> 126.29899999999999
[Music]

123.659 --> 128.6
it's still kind of cold I mean like the

126.299 --> 128.6
the

128.64 --> 134.099
temperature is like migrating towards

131.7 --> 136.51999999999998
water cold typically which is kind of

134.099 --> 136.51999999999998
annoying

137.22 --> 141.58
but yeah that's what you get when it

139.92 --> 144.83999999999997
becomes winner

141.58 --> 147.739
[Music]

144.84 --> 147.739
but uh

149.099 --> 153.76999999999998
yeah it still looks

151.98 --> 155.28
pretty nice out there

153.77 --> 158.9
[Music]

155.28 --> 158.9
but yesterday was better

159.78 --> 163.16
okay what's this

163.26 --> 166.819
YouTube installing again

169.43 --> 172.689
[Music]

176.74 --> 180.86
[Music]

186.72 --> 193.739
okay hmm yeah my internet was stalling

190.98 --> 197.23899999999998
for some reason it still kept streaming

193.739 --> 197.239
though weird anyway

197.58 --> 205.98000000000002
hello jindali first in chat LSG

201.84 --> 207.48
Gideon sick Crockett Welsh rice good to

205.98 --> 209.459
see you all

207.48 --> 212.57999999999998
it's a

209.459 --> 216.0
lot of people right away

212.58 --> 217.64000000000001
anyway it's Tuesday the 15th of November

216.0 --> 223.669
2022

217.64 --> 223.66899999999998
[Music]

224.76 --> 229.56
all right oh it's still raining in the

227.459 --> 232.22
UK

229.56 --> 232.22
huh

234.12 --> 238.20000000000002
yeah we're we're not having a lot of

236.34 --> 241.62
rain here it's

238.2 --> 244.01899999999998
kind of a bit of a dry

241.62 --> 246.36
autumn

244.019 --> 248.4
but yeah I might be speaking too soon

246.36 --> 251.42000000000002
because yeah this could all turn around

248.4 --> 251.42000000000002
just like that

254.939 --> 261.239
but so far it's been relatively dry

258.82 --> 264.78
[Music]

261.239 --> 268.73999999999995
degrees Celsius right now here

264.78 --> 269.52
it says it should be raining but

268.74 --> 271.38
what

269.52 --> 274.09999999999997
[Music]

271.38 --> 274.1
okay

277.38 --> 282.65999999999997
it says raining but there's literally

279.9 --> 285.96
not a cloud inside that could actually

282.66 --> 288.90000000000003
yield rain so that's kind of weird

285.96 --> 291.56
but maybe it will be predicted to rain

288.9 --> 291.56
later on

291.66 --> 294.139
today

296.4 --> 300.21
anyway hey Mike zidernitch good to see

299.82 --> 303.63
you

300.21 --> 303.63
[Music]

305.28 --> 310.63899999999995
snow forecast the shower oh okay

312.9 --> 318.78
all right yeah over here usually

316.32 --> 323.09999999999997
I mean in the last

318.78 --> 327.02
two decades we barely even get snow

323.1 --> 328.82000000000005
like in November December

327.02 --> 332.88
and

328.82 --> 335.52
well my experience usually if it snows

332.88 --> 339.74
at all it usually comes early in

335.52 --> 339.74
February around my birthday

342.539 --> 346.5
that's what's been happening so far so

344.699 --> 352.779
we'll see what happens this year

346.5 --> 352.779
[Music]

353.28 --> 358.02
personally wouldn't mind a little bit

355.02 --> 360.18
more snow it does kind of help scatter

358.02 --> 364.15999999999997
the light

360.18 --> 364.16
the sunlight that's kind of nice

364.979 --> 369.62
unless you're driving then it's kind of

367.199 --> 369.62
annoying

374.24 --> 379.34000000000003
ah AP you seen it good to see you

380.93 --> 384.439
[Music]

390.78 --> 396.25899999999996
right so yes this Flat Earth debate was

393.78 --> 396.25899999999996
pretty cool

396.84 --> 399.84
foreign

400.88 --> 405.9
did not last long Nathan probably had to

404.22 --> 407.759
go or something because it yeah the

405.9 --> 410.81899999999996
after show after the live show ended

407.759 --> 412.8
only lasted half an hour

410.819 --> 415.8
but it was kind of interesting because

412.8 --> 417.84000000000003
the guys were working on

415.8 --> 420.66
kind of like figure out a new

417.84 --> 422.539
housekeeping question

420.66 --> 426.74
that's like

422.539 --> 426.74
geometric in nature again

427.139 --> 431.699
and yeah that was interesting so we'll

430.199 --> 434.46000000000004
see it

431.699 --> 437.34000000000003
we might continue that today on the live

434.46 --> 438.9
show if the guys have continued thinking

437.34 --> 440.34
about it might come up another day as

438.9 --> 442.14
well we'll see

440.34 --> 443.94
but yeah that was interesting

442.14 --> 445.86
[Music]

443.94 --> 450.0
it was very interesting also because

445.86 --> 453.47900000000004
basically they consulted my bow in

450.0 --> 456.84
and that works yeah I I can actually

453.479 --> 457.46999999999997
function like that exactly like that

456.84 --> 458.75899999999996
yeah

457.47 --> 462.08000000000004
[Music]

458.759 --> 462.08000000000004
it was a good show yeah

466.56 --> 472.099
I don't know what's that

469.08 --> 472.099
that's my camera

481.74 --> 484.40000000000003
right

486.85 --> 493.02000000000004
[Music]

490.86 --> 496.759
hello by the way dank

493.02 --> 496.75899999999996
I haven't said hello yet

500.28 --> 505.46
right so yeah I've been

502.5 --> 505.46
yesterday

506.4 --> 510.29999999999995
didn't watch any Netflix or anything

508.44 --> 512.52
even though that series is still gonna

510.3 --> 515.279
that Transformers thing I kind of want

512.52 --> 516.7189999999999
to continue it but I didn't get to it

515.279 --> 519.5
uh

516.719 --> 519.5
let's see

522.24 --> 528.839
Jim Bob was live that was hilarious

526.279 --> 531.62
uh yeah also caught up on some old

528.839 --> 531.62
Benjamin again

533.1 --> 537.9200000000001
I did that pretty much before this show

538.08 --> 543.839
Eric Dubai had an interesting video

541.44 --> 545.82
like a really generalized video but

543.839 --> 549.24
pretty well made

545.82 --> 551.1
why is Flat Earth important I might have

549.24 --> 554.1800000000001
picked up on that

551.1 --> 554.1800000000001
it's a pretty good one

556.74 --> 560.159
[Music]

564.6 --> 569.76
hmm

566.76 --> 569.76
foreign

593.76 --> 598.519
oh yeah and of course

602.7 --> 610.1600000000001
one of my favorite videos

607.14 --> 611.58
this season

610.16 --> 613.14
[Music]

611.58 --> 616.26
I don't know if I linked it up yesterday

613.14 --> 619.3199999999999
but I'm going to link it up again I mean

616.26 --> 622.58
oh Benjamin made a separate video

619.32 --> 622.58
on bit shoot about it

623.7 --> 629.58
I mean that that's like old-fashioned oh

626.82 --> 631.58
and Benjamin hilarious

629.58 --> 631.58
um

634.89 --> 640.6999999999999
[Music]

637.74 --> 643.98
hello seeking star water

640.7 --> 646.26
Yellowstone right

643.98 --> 648.54
I've heard you mentioned that before I

646.26 --> 651.68
haven't been able to like I didn't it's

648.54 --> 651.68
not on Netflix I think

653.399 --> 658.23
or if it is they're trying to keep it

655.56 --> 666.6389999999999
out of my face

658.23 --> 666.639
[Music]

667.579 --> 670.9399999999999
oh my God

671.16 --> 676.64
YouTube is acting weird

673.74 --> 676.64
stalling

681.0 --> 684.98
not on Netflix okay that would explain

694.36 --> 698.969
[Music]

699.779 --> 713.349
all right

701.54 --> 713.3489999999999
[Music]

714.6 --> 720.9590000000001
Paramount okay on some other

718.44 --> 725.1800000000001
streaming thing

720.959 --> 725.18
well there's a lot of them these days

729.42 --> 734.76
I mean I can barely keep track and is it

732.12 --> 736.7
even worth it I mean this whole

734.76 --> 740.279
sort of like

736.7 --> 741.779
streaming platforms like Netflix and the

740.279 --> 744.959
way it's developing it's kind of

741.779 --> 748.38
starting to feel like a console war

744.959 --> 750.42
like video game console Wars

748.38 --> 751.8
from the 90s it's kind of starting to

750.42 --> 755.0999999999999
feel like that

751.8 --> 756.7199999999999
because they're all just like oh no me

755.1 --> 760.88
me

756.72 --> 760.88
but is it really worth it

761.459 --> 766.16
well I guess that every one of those

764.1 --> 767.72
streaming platforms has their own

766.16 --> 770.899
Keystone

767.72 --> 770.899
Rosetta Stone

771.18 --> 774.68
like quality series

776.399 --> 780.44
Paramount Studios Movie Makers

787.8 --> 793.3199999999999
okay

790.38 --> 795.779
I mean I'm gonna take that there is a

793.32 --> 798.8000000000001
streaming platform like Netflix right

795.779 --> 798.8
seeking style water

806.519 --> 815.72
or is it just basically the company

810.72 --> 815.72
the company movie store or something

816.3 --> 822.18
where you can just look at a few of

818.76 --> 825.42
their very specific products

822.18 --> 826.38
like a micro stream house or something I

825.42 --> 829.019
don't know

826.38 --> 830.82
but I mean seriously they all this

829.019 --> 833.639
entire thing is starting to feel like

830.82 --> 834.839
just like the console Wars

833.639 --> 837.36
to me

834.839 --> 841.339
except now it's

837.36 --> 841.339
video streaming platforms

847.62 --> 850.62
oh

851.0 --> 856.139
yeah pirating becomes even more useful

854.459 --> 859.0999999999999
but also it is just super

856.139 --> 859.1
counterproductive

859.5 --> 866.12
except from well sort of a slavery type

863.399 --> 866.12
viewpoint

866.279 --> 872.82
because you want everybody to be able to

870.6 --> 875.12
know about your product if it's really

872.82 --> 875.12
good

876.66 --> 881.16
you know

878.04 --> 884.899
I mean effectively

881.16 --> 891.06
a really in my

884.899 --> 891.06
untried but like in my Oracle views

891.54 --> 897.959
I'd say that if you just if you have

895.199 --> 900.8389999999999
like a really fantastic product

897.959 --> 903.079
then you should literally just like hand

900.839 --> 903.0790000000001
out

903.66 --> 908.06
hand out the show for free

910.86 --> 916.1
or like have

913.62 --> 917.639
like a

916.1 --> 920.94
yeah

917.639 --> 924.019
maybe not completely for free but like a

920.94 --> 924.019
free view of it

924.54 --> 931.92
I used to remember even like with uh

929.279 --> 934.5
it's kind of like sort of video

931.92 --> 935.88
stream Services directly tied in with

934.5 --> 938.04
television

935.88 --> 939.959
this I think this even existed in the

938.04 --> 942.54
90s

939.959 --> 944.6389999999999
where you could just like

942.54 --> 945.8389999999999
pay them a little and then you can watch

944.639 --> 950.1
a movie

945.839 --> 953.22
just pay per a movie

950.1 --> 955.62
whatever they had in their database

953.22 --> 957.779
well what if they could do something

955.62 --> 960.6
similar but just like

957.779 --> 963.8389999999999
okay you can just watch the first season

960.6 --> 965.279
for free of our Master product and

963.839 --> 967.98
here's

965.279 --> 972.24
like there's two more seasons

967.98 --> 976.519
right I mean that would like boom spread

972.24 --> 976.519
like a wildfire if it's really that good

979.079 --> 983.0999999999999
right they used to call that like a

981.899 --> 985.8
sampler

983.1 --> 987.48
just give out the sampler completely for

985.8 --> 990.18
free spread it far and wide and

987.48 --> 992.6990000000001
everybody can see it and then a lot of

990.18 --> 995.579
them if it's a good product will be

992.699 --> 995.89
gripped by it and they wanna see the

995.579 --> 1000.8
rest

995.89 --> 1003.98
[Music]

1000.8 --> 1005.7199999999999
it's much better than just like yeah

1003.98 --> 1008.12
you pay us first and you'll have to

1005.72 --> 1011.0
trust that it's not garbage we have

1008.12 --> 1013.699
yeah and if you then have like hundreds

1011.0 --> 1016.18
of those out there that's just like very

1013.699 --> 1016.18
annoying

1016.759 --> 1022.3000000000001
it it's annoying to me I'm basically not

1019.759 --> 1022.3000000000001
interested

1032.78 --> 1038.72
anyway it's just a rough idea to kind of

1035.839 --> 1041.36
like give an alternative to well this

1038.72 --> 1044.3600000000001
situation as it's growing

1041.36 --> 1047.4799999999998
it'll be streaming platforms they all

1044.36 --> 1049.6
want you to pay first

1047.48 --> 1049.6
yeah

1049.88 --> 1053.2990000000002
right but of course there's like

1051.5 --> 1056.179
different Natures to every streaming

1053.299 --> 1058.4
platform I mean Netflix is like it

1056.179 --> 1060.44
really is attempting to be like a a

1058.4 --> 1064.179
replacement for television

1060.44 --> 1064.179
by just having so much

1066.14 --> 1074.0
unfortunately also a lot of garbage but

1069.2 --> 1077.299
it just has so much right and that way

1074.0 --> 1078.43
there's always something you can view

1077.299 --> 1081.459
hopefully

1078.43 --> 1081.459
[Music]

1082.52 --> 1090.34
right but we don't need like 20

1085.9 --> 1090.3400000000001
netflixes that all have everything

1091.34 --> 1095.4399999999998
because that would that would be just

1092.9 --> 1095.44
annoying

1099.14 --> 1104.7800000000002
version but with ads

1101.559 --> 1107.1399999999999
okay that is also annoying but hey it

1104.78 --> 1107.1399999999999
could work

1121.7 --> 1126.99
foreign

1123.09 --> 1126.99
[Music]

1130.41 --> 1133.929
[Music]

1158.02 --> 1167.5
yeah I'm looking at their logo

1162.2 --> 1167.5
it's a mountain surrounded by stars

1169.28 --> 1174.26
but you think that's a reference to

1171.14 --> 1176.98
mount meru and and the Dome

1174.26 --> 1176.98
could be

1181.7 --> 1186.2
oh right yeah hey Lenox yeah I did

1184.28 --> 1187.1
appreciate your PayPal thank you for

1186.2 --> 1190.179
that

1187.1 --> 1190.1789999999999
that's awesome

1190.99 --> 1197.089
[Music]

1197.419 --> 1201.5800000000002
hello also or Ronaldo Wombo

1205.94 --> 1208.96
the comment

1211.58 --> 1214.059
what

1223.039 --> 1228.3799999999999
about I've been around for years yeah

1224.96 --> 1230.8400000000001
yeah it's one of the older groups

1228.38 --> 1232.88
movie groups

1230.84 --> 1235.1599999999999
or yeah

1232.88 --> 1236.96
what do you call that a movie company

1235.16 --> 1239.5
Studio

1236.96 --> 1239.5
whatever

1250.76 --> 1259.12
I had a comment to the bed oh oh I I did

1254.24 --> 1259.1200000000001
not see that or well I did not read it

1260.26 --> 1265.48
I was kind of in the middle of doing

1263.179 --> 1265.48
stuff

1281.96 --> 1287.14
oh wait I see a comment about Phil Bell

1297.94 --> 1301.1200000000001
come on

1302.179 --> 1305.98
so taking so damn long

1325.22 --> 1333.039
Bell said I'm scared of cylons

1330.08 --> 1333.039
uh

1335.72 --> 1338.5
okay

1338.84 --> 1344.12
well I mean even in the old Battlestar

1341.539 --> 1346.1589999999999
Galactica yeah I did actually think the

1344.12 --> 1349.3999999999999
cylons were kind of scary

1346.159 --> 1351.2600000000002
even though they look kind of silly

1349.4 --> 1353.299
really

1351.26 --> 1357.02
but yeah I watched it when I was much

1353.299 --> 1359.96
younger I did think they were scary

1357.02 --> 1361.82
but uh I don't think that's really the

1359.96 --> 1364.159
reason

1361.82 --> 1366.3999999999999
the reason is is that I just can't find

1364.159 --> 1366.4
it

1370.41 --> 1379.46
[Music]

1376.64 --> 1381.98
they were yeah hello getting sick but

1379.46 --> 1383.8400000000001
yeah they were

1381.98 --> 1386.419
I mean they were basically just

1383.84 --> 1390.4399999999998
Terminator robots

1386.419 --> 1392.0
but slower and less like ooh scary

1390.44 --> 1394.6000000000001
skeleton

1392.0 --> 1394.6
right

1395.179 --> 1401.38
but they were effectively just

1397.4 --> 1401.38
terminated robots so

1408.39 --> 1414.0890000000002
[Music]

1417.88 --> 1423.98
BBC iPlayer free app

1421.4 --> 1426.94
yeah but I Len I don't think that works

1423.98 --> 1426.94
outside of England

1427.94 --> 1434.96
I think that's like a British thing

1431.9 --> 1437.8600000000001
we have some of that too here with Dutch

1434.96 --> 1437.8600000000001
stuff

1442.46 --> 1445.589
[Music]

1447.98 --> 1452.3600000000001
in the original did they have robots

1449.96 --> 1455.77
that appear human yeah

1452.36 --> 1455.77
[Music]

1456.02 --> 1462.74
I mean they had like the golden helmets

1458.72 --> 1464.659
with the the light thingy just like kit

1462.74 --> 1467.72
from Knight Rider

1464.659 --> 1470.6200000000001
and like it's like all black with golden

1467.72 --> 1475.299
helmets and they were like robotic

1470.62 --> 1475.299
golden Centurion like looking

1476.78 --> 1479.52
let's see if I can find a picture of

1478.64 --> 1493.5
that

1479.52 --> 1493.5
[Music]

1495.62 --> 1502.58
hmm I'm seeing a picture of the the new

1500.299 --> 1505.94
they look pretty they look even scarier

1502.58 --> 1508.22
but yeah the old one looked kind of like

1505.94 --> 1510.559
is well it's kind of funny most of the

1508.22 --> 1513.58
silence kind of just look like fat dudes

1510.559 --> 1513.58
in costumes really

1515.06 --> 1518.46
[Music]

1519.86 --> 1524.6789999999999
but yeah I mean it worked well enough

1528.02 --> 1531.98
scared me

1529.539 --> 1535.0
anyway as a kid

1531.98 --> 1535.0
right yeah

1536.71 --> 1540.71
[Music]

1550.94 --> 1556.46
and the new version they have some

1553.58 --> 1558.32
models yeah but they had that too

1556.46 --> 1561.32
they had that too in the old Battlestar

1558.32 --> 1563.059
Galactica I think Lynn Lennox

1561.32 --> 1565.52
it's just that

1563.059 --> 1568.1589999999999
you didn't really notice because they

1565.52 --> 1571.4
were basically like well human so it's

1568.159 --> 1573.0800000000002
like they were the Emperors they were

1571.4 --> 1575.72
all human looking but they were actually

1573.08 --> 1579.1
robots I think

1575.72 --> 1579.1000000000001
or at least some of them

1580.94 --> 1586.7
I'm not entirely sure anymore but

1584.299 --> 1590.6589999999999
I would not be surprised if that was

1586.7 --> 1593.14
also in the old Battlestar Galactica

1590.659 --> 1593.14
right

1607.82 --> 1612.1
because they had that sound come yeah

1609.62 --> 1612.1
yeah

1613.88 --> 1619.0
I mean that was that that was also

1616.34 --> 1619.0
intimidating

1619.52 --> 1626.86
it was like the 80s voice robot

1623.12 --> 1626.86
Transformer sound like thing

1632.659 --> 1639.46
or 70s I guess anyway he reflected

1636.38 --> 1639.46
curvature good to see you

1648.74 --> 1667.43
foreign

1651.44 --> 1667.43
[Music]

1674.36 --> 1681.039
it's kind of weird now that I think

1675.98 --> 1685.539
about it because like the robot from

1681.039 --> 1689.08
uh from the newer Series in Netflix

1685.539 --> 1689.08
Lost in Space

1689.36 --> 1695.4189999999999
or 80 gallons be sufficient but yeah the

1692.24 --> 1698.86
newer one that thing also reminded me of

1695.419 --> 1702.3200000000002
the cylons like that would be like a

1698.86 --> 1705.3999999999999
super futuristic Silo like the most

1702.32 --> 1705.3999999999999
advanced version

1706.76 --> 1711.86
but like in that the way they put it in

1709.7 --> 1713.419
that series and there were others it

1711.86 --> 1715.76
really did make me feel like yeah they

1713.419 --> 1719.8600000000001
are actually cylons

1715.76 --> 1724.58
they kind of grafted that concept into

1719.86 --> 1727.539
that new Lost in Space series

1724.58 --> 1731.3799999999999
didn't you think so

1727.539 --> 1731.3799999999999
anybody who's seen that

1741.14 --> 1744.74
never seen that oh okay

1742.98 --> 1745.88
[Music]

1744.74 --> 1748.34
yeah

1745.88 --> 1751.3600000000001
it's on Netflix it's a series it's been

1748.34 --> 1751.36
out for a long time

1751.7 --> 1756.0800000000002
it has

1753.26 --> 1759.1
annoying things about it and it has like

1756.08 --> 1761.779
really awesome role-playing

1759.1 --> 1765.52
awesomeness things to it as well

1761.779 --> 1765.52
especially in like the last season

1768.51 --> 1773.049
[Music]

1775.039 --> 1778.399
never could get into yeah I know what

1776.899 --> 1781.58
you mean PG cinet that's so funny

1778.399 --> 1784.58
because I had exactly the same thing

1781.58 --> 1787.399
but then I thought like no you know what

1784.58 --> 1789.4399999999998
it annoys me but I'm just gonna push

1787.399 --> 1794.26
through and just keep watching

1789.44 --> 1794.26
and then it actually becomes much better

1794.779 --> 1799.0
they mostly redeem it

1804.44 --> 1810.799
but yeah the exaggerated characters are

1807.5 --> 1812.84
what they are and it is annoying I agree

1810.799 --> 1815.779
especially at first you're like what the

1812.84 --> 1817.779
[ __ ] is this theatrical over exaggerated

1815.779 --> 1822.44
[ __ ]

1817.779 --> 1824.84
but later it just day up

1822.44 --> 1826.64
the the quality of the dynamic a little

1824.84 --> 1828.3799999999999
and it really does become a lot more

1826.64 --> 1830.2990000000002
interesting but you got to get through

1828.38 --> 1833.0
that first part I agree it was very

1830.299 --> 1834.32
annoying I I halted watching it too for

1833.0 --> 1837.58
like two years

1834.32 --> 1837.58
before I tried it again

1840.679 --> 1845.419
no not Gary Oldman Gary Oldman is like

1843.62 --> 1848.36
in the movie

1845.419 --> 1850.8200000000002
from the 90s

1848.36 --> 1853.1589999999999
that's just one movie and it was I

1850.82 --> 1854.539
thought that movie was entertaining

1853.159 --> 1857.2990000000002
but

1854.539 --> 1859.8799999999999
yeah

1857.299 --> 1862.76
not super impressive it's not yeah it

1859.88 --> 1865.3400000000001
had some like uh okay the acting was

1862.76 --> 1866.6589999999999
cool Gary Oldman was very cool

1865.34 --> 1871.039
but

1866.659 --> 1873.3990000000001
yeah I mean it's kind of forgettable

1871.039 --> 1873.399
still

1876.74 --> 1880.1200000000001
but I've seen worse movies

1880.52 --> 1884.48
foreign

1882.26 --> 1887.5
but I'm talking about the Netflix series

1884.48 --> 1887.5
which is from like

1887.72 --> 1892.659
12 years ago or something

1890.24 --> 1892.659
I think

1895.659 --> 1912.17
I might need to look it up

1898.83 --> 1912.1699999999998
[Music]

1915.02 --> 1921.1399999999999
whoa

1916.82 --> 1924.9399999999998
no okay not from 12 years ago 2018.

1921.14 --> 1924.94
apparently it's much newer than that

1944.179 --> 1949.22
huh

1946.34 --> 1951.35
right anyway

1949.22 --> 1954.55
that's the one I'm talking about

1951.35 --> 1954.55
[Music]

1976.399 --> 1980.899
but to consider is a different of course

1978.799 --> 1984.3799999999999
seeking star of course

1980.899 --> 1989.1399999999999
I mean the original Lost in Space was

1984.38 --> 1989.14
like a classic Sci-fi thingy

1989.48 --> 1995.6200000000001
it was like the unique chemistry of like

1992.6 --> 1997.2199999999998
the possibilities like just like uh

1995.62 --> 1999.4299999999998
[Music]

1997.22 --> 2002.66
like oh my God

1999.43 --> 2002.66
[Music]

2006.34 --> 2012.519
The Twilight Zone right it's roughly the

2009.88 --> 2014.919
same time I think too

2012.519 --> 2017.2
well in that time it was like science

2014.919 --> 2021.1200000000001
fiction it was all very mental it was

2017.2 --> 2025.059
all like get let's get very seriously

2021.12 --> 2028.539
presuppositional here right and Lost in

2025.059 --> 2031.98
Space the old movie it was just that or

2028.539 --> 2031.98
mini whatever it was

2033.22 --> 2039.519
it was just very sci-fi of that time you

2037.36 --> 2041.9189999999999
can't do that again it doesn't work

2039.519 --> 2044.08
anymore because it wasn't meant

2041.919 --> 2047.38
for the future it was meant for the

2044.08 --> 2049.48
people then as like an introduction to

2047.38 --> 2052.3
science fiction Concepts is how a lot of

2049.48 --> 2055.48
stuff was done back then

2052.3 --> 2057.8790000000004
you can't you it's no point trying to

2055.48 --> 2062.619
remake the same thing exactly the same

2057.879 --> 2065.379
so I thought that well the

2062.619 --> 2067.54
the newer series did actually

2065.379 --> 2068.7599999999998
they made it something completely

2067.54 --> 2071.859
different

2068.76 --> 2075.2200000000003
culturally because yeah what is it now

2071.859 --> 2077.919
50 years later or something

2075.22 --> 2080.7999999999997
but it was still interesting and the I

2077.919 --> 2083.859
like the actors the actors were all

2080.8 --> 2085.8990000000003
doing their best

2083.859 --> 2088.0
and like the little kid yeah I think

2085.899 --> 2090.22
he's a little annoying but like you

2088.0 --> 2092.379
supposed to be annoying I think

2090.22 --> 2094.839
and when he's like getting a little

2092.379 --> 2097.7799999999997
bigger like his character like

2094.839 --> 2100.48
dramatically improves and I really like

2097.78 --> 2102.5800000000004
that that he grew up and like certainly

2100.48 --> 2104.82
wasn't such an annoying little [ __ ]

2102.58 --> 2104.8199999999997
anymore

2105.04 --> 2110.14
I really like that in the series the new

2107.44 --> 2112.78
one so

2110.14 --> 2114.94
and it was so much about family spirit

2112.78 --> 2117.7000000000003
and guys

2114.94 --> 2120.64
to have that as Siri where it's like

2117.7 --> 2124.24
centered around very serious family

2120.64 --> 2126.22
Dynamics that's kind of rare to even

2124.24 --> 2128.7599999999998
find out there

2126.22 --> 2128.7599999999998
okay

2128.98 --> 2132.3
I mean seriously

2130.96 --> 2135.339
how many

2132.3 --> 2138.46
family-oriented series of any sort are

2135.339 --> 2140.02
out there that are not like just

2138.46 --> 2143.38
deranged

2140.02 --> 2146.44
that's rare okay that's actually rare

2143.38 --> 2149.02
now and this series did did do their

2146.44 --> 2152.26
best to really make it serious the

2149.02 --> 2154.839
family Dynamics and I really liked it

2152.26 --> 2155.98
I thought that dad was a freaking epic

2154.839 --> 2160.66
dad

2155.98 --> 2163.06
and so was the mom and like all of them

2160.66 --> 2166.5
they were all really into their family

2163.06 --> 2166.5
function and I loved it

2168.46 --> 2171.54
he did voyage

2181.599 --> 2186.9990000000003
foreign

2183.78 --> 2186.9990000000003
[Music]

2189.82 --> 2195.28
[Music]

2192.06 --> 2197.68
so again the new series it had some

2195.28 --> 2201.1600000000003
really good points that are kind of rare

2197.68 --> 2203.75
it is kind of unique as a series I think

2201.16 --> 2205.0
that makes it like worth remembering

2203.75 --> 2208.3
[Music]

2205.0 --> 2210.94
but yeah it's not been like the best

2208.3 --> 2214.42
series ever or anything it had some

2210.94 --> 2216.16
really annoying shitty things in it

2214.42 --> 2219.04
I mean

2216.16 --> 2221.56
they basically sort of whether they did

2219.04 --> 2223.96
it intentionally or not like Paula

2221.56 --> 2226.839
George Lucas on the stupid robot making

2223.96 --> 2228.46
him constantly say

2226.839 --> 2230.02
uh

2228.46 --> 2231.88
you know what

2230.02 --> 2234.099
and that's probably one of the things

2231.88 --> 2238.96
that at when you're watching it at first

2234.099 --> 2243.0
it's like oh my God no no that's so

2238.96 --> 2243.0
cheesy and so lame

2243.4 --> 2249.04
I mean that's like being in the future

2245.8 --> 2251.28
and then suddenly waving your Nostalgia

2249.04 --> 2255.06
flag in the middle of nowhere like

2251.28 --> 2255.0600000000004
pointless it was lame

2256.24 --> 2263.02
but eventually that just it the soreness

2261.099 --> 2266.94
of that goes down and they just start

2263.02 --> 2266.94
focusing on more interesting things

2268.72 --> 2273.91
anyway

2270.7 --> 2273.91

2293.14 --> 2296.5
uh

2294.339 --> 2299.56
yeah only the lonely has got a point

2296.5 --> 2301.54
there Tara 306 I mean the word flawless

2299.56 --> 2303.5789999999997
is very specific

2301.54 --> 2306.64
if you say Flawless but you don't mean

2303.579 --> 2310.6800000000003
it's totally Flawless well then you

2306.64 --> 2310.68
didn't use the word correctly

2313.24 --> 2319.1189999999997
right if it's not Flawless then yeah you

2316.42 --> 2321.46
could call it nearly flawless

2319.119 --> 2323.8
you can't just call it Flawless and then

2321.46 --> 2327.46
expect somebody else to think that no

2323.8 --> 2330.2200000000003
but it's not actually ex 100 flaws well

2327.46 --> 2332.76
then it's not Flawless just it's an

2330.22 --> 2332.7599999999998
English thing

2333.579 --> 2338.4590000000003

foreign

2354.339 --> 2357.9
what are you talking about anyway

2359.98 --> 2363.72
all right just referencing

2363.88 --> 2371.32

2366.22 --> 2374.6189999999997
stuff I think when Landing program

[Music]

2382.44 --> 2385.859
okay Terry

2390.16 --> 2394.42
well tered maybe you just mean

2392.92 --> 2396.099
unhindered

2394.42 --> 2397.7200000000003
right

2396.099 --> 2400.1800000000003
I think that's the word you're looking

2397.72 --> 2401.98
for it's not Flawless or Flawless it's

2400.18 --> 2405.339
unhindered they

2401.98 --> 2407.92
they got to just do it all of it

2405.339 --> 2410.02
immediately right

2407.92 --> 2412.839
there was no like oh we need another

2410.02 --> 2414.46
five years or something like no none of

2412.839 --> 2417.64
that it was just like no we're doing

2414.46 --> 2418.56
this all of it right now so there was no

2417.64 --> 2421.96
delay

2418.56 --> 2424.42
[Music]

2421.96 --> 2426.64
that's the big difference

2424.42 --> 2430.3
because now everything is always just

2426.64 --> 2431.68
getting delayed delayed delay

2430.3 --> 2437.3390000000004
it's like they're not even trying

2431.68 --> 2437.339
anymore because in reality well they are

2438.22 --> 2442.5989999999997
it's a scam they're just

2440.38 --> 2445.9
trying to collect as many monies on your

2442.599 --> 2447.82
hopes and dreams as you'll give them

2445.9 --> 2454.859
hoping you'll Double Down

[Music]

2469.9 --> 2475.1800000000003
space tourism

2472.42 --> 2477.64
yeah but Terry to be fair there sort of

2475.18 --> 2481.72
is already space tourism

2477.64 --> 2483.4
right so the the Bezos penis rockets and

2481.72 --> 2487.3799999999997
all that [ __ ]

2483.4 --> 2487.38
it supposedly already is there

2490.24 --> 2493.7799999999997
but I mean any type of look in the

2492.76 --> 2496.3590000000004
future

2493.78 --> 2498.82
as if this keeps on going and going then

2496.359 --> 2500.859
in the future then space tourism will

2498.82 --> 2501.94
also be an act

2500.859 --> 2505.42
right

2501.94 --> 2508.119
it will be like this only Freemasons

2505.42 --> 2510.7000000000003
will effectively be able to engage in

2508.119 --> 2512.619
space terrorism and then they can

2510.7 --> 2515.98
have it filmed

2512.619 --> 2518.619
have a story about it whatever they

2515.98 --> 2521.26
choose to do with that

2518.619 --> 2523.839
and then they go and go

2521.26 --> 2526.42
I don't know and just say like yeah we

2523.839 --> 2528.46
went to the moon base or we went to

2526.42 --> 2532.7400000000002
Mars again and

2528.46 --> 2535.78
right but yeah non-initiated civilians

2532.74 --> 2537.64
of course are never going to engage in

2535.78 --> 2540.6400000000003
space tourism so it's only going to be

2537.64 --> 2542.74
for the connected the super rich which

2540.64 --> 2543.52
are also connected in Freemasons of

2542.74 --> 2546.7799999999997
course

2543.52 --> 2546.78
a lot of them at least

2547.0 --> 2552.16
no all of them the super rich I'm

2549.82 --> 2552.94
talking about and just like part of the

2552.16 --> 2555.64
club

2552.94 --> 2557.92
so those are going to be the ones that

2555.64 --> 2560.5789999999997
can engage in space tourism but they can

2557.92 --> 2560.579
never actually

2561.82 --> 2565.48
like

2563.02 --> 2567.88
they could give you an a fascinating

2565.48 --> 2571.599
ride at some point perhaps I've I've

2567.88 --> 2574.78
even conceived systems

2571.599 --> 2579.1600000000003
on how to fake it

2574.78 --> 2580.599
which I'm not gonna like hand over just

2579.16 --> 2582.64
like that

2580.599 --> 2584.7400000000002
and perhaps they've already been working

2582.64 --> 2587.44
on this [ __ ] right maybe they already

2584.74 --> 2591.4799999999996
have it because there's ways to fake it

2587.44 --> 2591.48
even to a civilian

2594.16 --> 2600.7599999999998
but it is like it's gonna take a lot

2596.859 --> 2603.94
more effort to actually achieve that to

2600.76 --> 2606.0400000000004
basically get ignore me through it and

2603.94 --> 2609.2200000000003
then completely believing it because it

2606.04 --> 2613.54
like if you actually try an operation

2609.22 --> 2616.839
like that and you can't make it succeed

2613.54 --> 2619.24
by having flaws in plain sight that

2616.839 --> 2620.98
those people will pick up on and then

2619.24 --> 2622.9599999999996
ask about and then you having to tell

2620.98 --> 2625.119
them don't think about it

2622.96 --> 2627.339
then it's ruined

2625.119 --> 2629.619
right for some numpties it might work

2627.339 --> 2631.66
but you can't expect only to have

2629.619 --> 2634.0
numpty's trying to do that

2631.66 --> 2637.859
I mean I if there was some kind of thing

2634.0 --> 2637.859
like that I'd be really interested

2638.2 --> 2643.4199999999996
like if they're at some point would be

2641.079 --> 2645.94
like space tourism that's like more

2643.42 --> 2647.6800000000003
readily available and not just for the

2645.94 --> 2649.96
Mega Ultra rich

2647.68 --> 2653.2
in some way

2649.96 --> 2656.079
then I'd like to like try it out like as

2653.2 --> 2657.52
a skeptic like as an Insider skeptic

2656.079 --> 2659.6400000000003
almost like

2657.52 --> 2662.92
you know

2659.64 --> 2664.9
lock developers they want people that

2662.92 --> 2667.54
know how to pick locks

2664.9 --> 2669.7000000000003
they they need them to figure out the

2667.54 --> 2673.2599999999998
flaws in their in their designs right

2669.7 --> 2673.2599999999998
well I could be that

2673.96 --> 2680.02
for for this type of trickery it's like

2678.22 --> 2682.0
be like okay going in the ride is like

2680.02 --> 2682.96
wow this looks really real and then like

2682.0 --> 2685.06
oh

2682.96 --> 2686.26
you missed the spot you got to take care

2685.06 --> 2688.599
of that

2686.26 --> 2690.579
if people bump into that the suspension

2688.599 --> 2692.619
of disbelief is going to be ruined I

2690.579 --> 2695.98
mean I could do that

2692.619 --> 2699.48
I could do that really well

2695.98 --> 2699.48
I'm up for higher

2706.78 --> 2713.2000000000003
but yeah man I mean

2709.78 --> 2715.3190000000004
roller coasters to the next level roller

2713.2 --> 2718.1189999999997
coasters

2715.319 --> 2719.98
specifically designed to actually make

2718.119 --> 2724.44
you believe you're going to space or

2719.98 --> 2724.44
some other planet now that would be epic

2725.74 --> 2731.7
right that's roller coaster to the next

2728.02 --> 2731.7
level wouldn't it wouldn't it be

2739.18 --> 2744.66
or maybe I'm going too far now with my

2742.18 --> 2744.66
Ballwin

2755.16 --> 2760.24
roller space

2758.26 --> 2763.2000000000003
no

2760.24 --> 2763.2
uh

2763.66 --> 2768.54
it's a space roller coaster

2775.119 --> 2779.92
right I mean with the right setup you

2778.54 --> 2783.4
could have like

2779.92 --> 2787.06
instead of a vomit Comet plane you could

2783.4 --> 2788.079
have like a tunnel roller coaster system

2787.06 --> 2792.64
or

2788.079 --> 2796.1800000000003
well how about maglev roller coaster

2792.64 --> 2798.64
that could for a very much longer

2796.18 --> 2802.2
prolonged time with perfect stability

2798.64 --> 2806.5
without the stupid turbulence Tremors

2802.2 --> 2809.56
actually simulate zero g

2806.5 --> 2812.14
for like more than two minutes right

2809.56 --> 2815.819
what if you could like build one of like

2812.14 --> 2815.819
a really big tunnel

2816.579 --> 2820.9
that would make it happen for like five

2819.819 --> 2823.72
minutes

2820.9 --> 2828.06
and then you well then it stops and then

2823.72 --> 2828.06
you have to go all the way back up

2832.359 --> 2838.86
but yeah I don't know I I don't know why

2836.319 --> 2851.32
I think of these things

2838.86 --> 2851.32
[Music]

2874.72 --> 2876.8999999999996
thank you

2879.04 --> 2885.9
right no I get it you can actually make

2882.88 --> 2885.9
it a two-way ride

2889.78 --> 2894.76
yeah

2892.0 --> 2897.4
dude you could literally make this into

2894.76 --> 2901.119
a ride

2897.4 --> 2903.04
but like a super heavy advanced roller

2901.119 --> 2903.819
coaster ride it would be expensive as

2903.04 --> 2906.22
[ __ ]

2903.819 --> 2907.9
by the way com like for maintenance

2906.22 --> 2910.2999999999997
probably

2907.9 --> 2913.54
but you could have like a two-way ride

2910.3 --> 2916.599
where one it's basically gonna launch

2913.54 --> 2918.88
you up and and gonna simulate you're

2916.599 --> 2921.52
you're in a rocket now guys you're in a

2918.88 --> 2924.52
rocket Bridge yourself for launching you

2921.52 --> 2926.079
hear you like behind you and you can

2924.52 --> 2929.44
have like a screen that's just gonna

2926.079 --> 2932.02
make you look like you're

2929.44 --> 2934.0
going into the atmosphere right and

2932.02 --> 2935.92
super fast and then at some point it

2934.0 --> 2938.14
reaches the top and then it's like poof

2935.92 --> 2940.96
now it stops

2938.14 --> 2944.14
and then it basically the track right

2940.96 --> 2946.839
it's gonna be a track like this

2944.14 --> 2948.7
like an up way and a downway and the up

2946.839 --> 2951.099
way is going to be the simulation oh

2948.7 --> 2952.8999999999996
we're bringing a rocket you're gonna

2951.099 --> 2955.7400000000002
feel the pressure like oh because you're

2952.9 --> 2958.839
being pushed up pretty fast

2955.74 --> 2960.52
right rocket simulation

2958.839 --> 2964.359
awesome

2960.52 --> 2969.099
and then at the top turns around

2964.359 --> 2972.5789999999997
and now it's the actual space

2969.099 --> 2975.339
yeah and then you get like zero g

2972.579 --> 2976.599
and dude you could even do that entire

2975.339 --> 2979.24
thing

2976.599 --> 2981.7000000000003
with like sound cancellation so that

2979.24 --> 2985.8999999999996
there's perfect silence can you imagine

2981.7 --> 2988.66
that is zero g simulator free fall

2985.9 --> 2991.359
that's perfectly smooth without Tremors

2988.66 --> 2994.5989999999997
because it's Mac left based

2991.359 --> 2997.9
and there's no turbulence right no like

2994.599 --> 3000.3590000000004
that [ __ ] like in the vomit Comet and

2997.9 --> 3002.1600000000003
that's and then like a noise

3000.359 --> 3004.74
cancellation

3002.16 --> 3008.04
systems so there's like perfect silence

3004.74 --> 3011.8799999999997
as you just float around for I mean dude

3008.04 --> 3016.2
is that a ride or what

3011.88 --> 3019.6400000000003
rocket launch zero g I mean do wouldn't

3016.2 --> 3019.64
that be freaking Epic Man

3020.42 --> 3024.48
thought there never was any though there

3022.92 --> 3027.2400000000002
isn't any

3024.48 --> 3029.099
but you can simulate it

3027.24 --> 3031.859
yeah that's what the vomit Comet

3029.099 --> 3035.04
attempts it's a simulation of a concept

3031.859 --> 3037.02
that doesn't actually exist in real life

3035.04 --> 3040.339
that doesn't mean that we cannot enjoy

3037.02 --> 3040.339
the fantasy of that

3043.859 --> 3047.839
please fasten your seat belts

3057.119 --> 3062.819
right well yeah

3060.66 --> 3064.5
how would you do that for the rocket

3062.819 --> 3065.819
launch you're definitely like for the

3064.5 --> 3067.5
rocket launch but you're definitely

3065.819 --> 3069.359
going to have to be seated and strapped

3067.5 --> 3072.119
up right just for the experience alone

3069.359 --> 3074.7599999999998
but then afterward you want to be able

3072.119 --> 3078.6800000000003
to unbuckle and then be able to kind of

3074.76 --> 3078.6800000000003
flee float around a bit

3078.72 --> 3084.9599999999996
and it must be well just like the vomit

3081.54 --> 3086.88
Comet kind of like damage proof like

3084.96 --> 3088.92
you shouldn't like just suddenly like

3086.88 --> 3090.839
bang go it shouldn't stop like that

3088.92 --> 3093.48
should smoothen out slightly so that you

3090.839 --> 3097.02
slow yeah

3093.48 --> 3100.02
that the gravity slowly comes back

3097.02 --> 3102.599
I mean dude I I don't know why but this

3100.02 --> 3106.079
ride yeah it could be done

3102.599 --> 3110.52
and it would be like an actual very much

3106.079 --> 3115.02
space simul space ride simulator

3110.52 --> 3117.42
can be done it's a crazy thing but

3115.02 --> 3120.54
if you give me hundreds of billions of

3117.42 --> 3123.02
dollars I will make the ultimate space

3120.54 --> 3123.02
simulator

3123.839 --> 3128.5789999999997
okay

3126.18 --> 3130.98
yeah seeing all those penis rocket

3128.579 --> 3132.9
[ __ ] they can all just go [ __ ]

3130.98 --> 3136.26
themselves I'll make an actual

3132.9 --> 3139.079
experience that literally any numpty can

3136.26 --> 3141.1800000000003
actually experience doesn't just have to

3139.079 --> 3144.059
be all show and that it doesn't actually

3141.18 --> 3146.3999999999996
happen you just oh you have to bragging

3144.059 --> 3148.92
rights to say you went to space yeah how

3146.4 --> 3149.92
about actually experience a simulation

3148.92 --> 3151.619
like that

3149.92 --> 3155.16
[Music]

3151.619 --> 3157.1400000000003
yeah I can make it happen

3155.16 --> 3159.319
I just need like a hundred billion or

3157.14 --> 3159.319
something

3162.72 --> 3165.319
foreign

3169.7 --> 3176.9399999999996
if I then get that funds then yeah I'm

3174.78 --> 3179.46
actually gonna have it built

3176.94 --> 3180.7200000000003
and it's not gonna be postponed every

3179.46 --> 3182.099
year

3180.72 --> 3185.8799999999997
how about that

3182.099 --> 3187.7400000000002
or sorry every few weeks

3185.88 --> 3189.6600000000003
right it's just gonna be a project

3187.74 --> 3192.0
you're gonna build it I think it's

3189.66 --> 3194.16
probably gonna take like well with 100

3192.0 --> 3197.94
billion you can really rush it

3194.16 --> 3200.7
and still be perfect quality

3197.94 --> 3202.8
so I'd say like two years

3200.7 --> 3205.6499999999996
three years

3202.8 --> 3208.02
and people could get in it

3205.65 --> 3211.92
[Music]

3208.02 --> 3213.0
now where however would I build such a

3211.92 --> 3215.2200000000003
thing

3213.0 --> 3217.619
you know because that thing's gonna take

3215.22 --> 3219.7799999999997
up a lot of space

3217.619 --> 3221.76
you're gonna literally have to like be

3219.78 --> 3223.94
able to build a giant tunnel in the

3221.76 --> 3223.94
ground

3225.119 --> 3232.319
and potentially in rock I mean I think

3228.9 --> 3234.42
yeah and like is that you're gonna have

3232.319 --> 3237.3
to find the right spot it's gonna take a

3234.42 --> 3239.88
lot of like geologists field research

3237.3 --> 3241.319
and chip but like in the side of a

3239.88 --> 3243.7400000000002
mountain right

3241.319 --> 3247.8
just Mountain

3243.74 --> 3250.0989999999997
big tunnel like straight into it and

3247.8 --> 3250.099
back

3250.859 --> 3253.339
right

3254.04 --> 3259.319
maybe use like one of those big digging

3257.94 --> 3261.7200000000003
worms

3259.319 --> 3263.16
tunnel diggers for that

3261.72 --> 3266.16
I don't know

3263.16 --> 3268.319
I'm very roughly speculating but I have

3266.16 --> 3269.64
this in my mind I mean this could be

3268.319 --> 3273.2
done

3269.64 --> 3273.2

3298.74 --> 3304.02

3301.079 --> 3305.579
I mean people can contact me about this

3304.02 --> 3308.04
or

3305.579 --> 3311.78
another likelihood is that somebody's

3308.04 --> 3311.7799999999997
actually gonna steal my idea

3312.3 --> 3314.9
right

3319.28 --> 3325.1600000000003
you don't just get giant amounts of

3322.02 --> 3325.16
money for a good idea

3326.28 --> 3330.2000000000003
couldn't you do it underwater

3330.9 --> 3335.04
um

3332.46 --> 3337.079
no

3335.04 --> 3340.079
you know why do you need sick because

3337.079 --> 3342.6600000000003
you need the stability

3340.079 --> 3345.6600000000003
yeah what's more stable than solid rock

3342.66 --> 3351.7799999999997
around you nothing pretty much nothing

3345.66 --> 3354.24
water is still Tremor sensitive it is

3351.78 --> 3358.52
subjectable to turbulence just like air

3354.24 --> 3358.52
it will give those stain problems

3360.059 --> 3366.0
I mean if you want to make it a cheaper

3363.18 --> 3368.819
ride like without the maglev without the

3366.0 --> 3370.619
perfect Stillness and all that yeah sure

3368.819 --> 3372.48
you could make a cheaper version and

3370.619 --> 3375.359
then you could just literally make it

3372.48 --> 3376.559
like a like a roller coaster ride even

3375.359 --> 3379.2599999999998
in midair

3376.559 --> 3381.96
and then it would be less Long etc etc

3379.26 --> 3383.8190000000004
etc but if you want that ultimate space

3381.96 --> 3386.599

3719.76 --> 3724.559
fine

3721.799 --> 3729.02
I mean look at this point I am

3724.559 --> 3729.02
personally not super invested in this

3729.2 --> 3735.5
legitimate in fighting War

3732.839 --> 3735.5
I just

3737.46 --> 3741.359
it's necessary

but it's also kind of boring today

3741.359 --> 3743.96
already

3744.0 --> 3749.64
so I'll be supportive of the guys but

3746.579 --> 3752.78
I'm just not super invested anymore it's

3749.64 --> 3752.7799999999997
just like I get it now

3753.42 --> 3758.579
good morning

3758.579 --> 3762.0
hammering in it

3760.26 --> 3766.44
hammering it in

3762.0 --> 3769.02
and good on him I mean he is actually

3766.44 --> 3771.059
well Nathan is almost yeah almost

3769.02 --> 3772.5
single-handedly just fighting the

3771.059 --> 3776.059
situation

3772.5 --> 3776.059

3780.119 --> 3787.7400000000002
where yeah in the last two years Nathan

3783.9 --> 3789.96
has held back a lot consistently and it

3787.74 --> 3793.9399999999996
felt at times like he was holding us

3789.96 --> 3793.94
back me and Brian

3794.819 --> 3801.18
like like no no no just uh

3797.819 --> 3805.339
let's just all be friends and work

3801.18 --> 3805.339
together and like just be colleagues

3807.0 --> 3811.98

3809.52 --> 3815.04
with this [ __ ]

3811.98 --> 3816.2400000000002
I try he tried Nathan absolutely tried I

3815.04 --> 3819.7799999999997
mean he did

3816.24 --> 3823.319
and he did honestly and admirably

3819.78 --> 3827.8390000000004
but yeah unfortunately uh it was not met

3823.319 --> 3827.839
with proper reciprocation

no

3868.76 --> 3873.0200000000004
especially not in capital letters

3881.64 --> 3886.68
more energy against debunking anti-flat

3884.579 --> 3888.119
earthers but he doesn't need more energy

3886.68 --> 3890.64
to that

3888.119 --> 3893.599
I mean the anti-flat earthers are so

3890.64 --> 3893.5989999999997
freaking predictable

3894.66 --> 3899.7
it's barely even a challenge for Nathan

3897.059 --> 3901.2900000000004
at this point it really is

3899.7 --> 3902.9399999999996
I mean

3901.29 --> 3905.579
[Music]

3902.94 --> 3909.059
like to eat that Nathan can like

3905.579 --> 3912.2400000000002
literally just be called out of bed by a

3909.059 --> 3914.8190000000004
screaming baby or something

3912.24 --> 3917.5789999999997
and if then an anti-flat earth just pops

3914.819 --> 3919.98
up somehow and immediately starts

3917.579 --> 3923.099
running he'll be like even half asleep

3919.98 --> 3926.099
he'll be able to just immediately figure

3923.099 --> 3929.059
out what's going on and how to

3926.099 --> 3929.059
negate it

3930.9 --> 3934.38
so

3932.28 --> 3936.059
I mean the anti-flight earthers are

3934.38 --> 3938.94
barely even a challenge and he is

3936.059 --> 3940.1400000000003
tackling them still

3938.94 --> 3942.96
but

3940.14 --> 3945.9
you know just giving them all your

3942.96 --> 3948.299
energy analyzing how stupid they am

3945.9 --> 3950.7000000000003
constantly will eventually basically

3948.299 --> 3953.28
give them more energy than they deserve

3950.7 --> 3955.319
because when you're that stupid for that

3953.28 --> 3958.0400000000004
long

3955.319 --> 3958.04
then

3958.619 --> 3963.319
is it even worth

all that energy

3964.859 --> 3969.7799999999997

correct an idiot for being wrong before

you basically figure out that they're

the actions from the flat earthers are

you seeing that

what they're doing is mimicking what the

flat earthers did balloons rockets and

4093.559 --> 4098.900000000001
just show them see we can do it more and

4096.38 --> 4102.38
we believe the Earth is a globe they're

4266.42 --> 4270.7390000000005
fireworks then

4268.06 --> 4274.3
oh goody it didn't have anything to

4270.739 --> 4274.299999999999
prove wow how useful

[Music]

4294.4 --> 4298.239
once with who

4300.5 --> 4304.36
PJ Cena who are you talking about

4304.94 --> 4309.5599999999995
with Mr sensible with Eddie Bravo who

4307.64 --> 4312.159000000001
are you talking about mctoon like who

4309.56 --> 4312.159000000001
are you talking about

4320.0 --> 4323.5
Mr sensor okay

4323.96 --> 4329.199
right it's a waste of your time

4326.6 --> 4329.1990000000005
I mean

4329.42 --> 4337.58
it there is no reason for any

4334.46 --> 4341.3
yeah Flat Earth or

4337.58 --> 4344.12
or not demonically possessed super gross

4341.3 --> 4348.08
person to get on with Mr sensible

4344.12 --> 4350.36
no use for that

4348.08 --> 4353.54
say avoid him avoid him all you can

4350.36 --> 4356.179
because it's just gross every time every

4353.54 --> 4358.58
time I like I remember it enough how

4356.179 --> 4361.159
freaking gross he is

4358.58 --> 4362.45
thank God I don't have to like overtly

4361.159 --> 4366.719999999999

4399.739 --> 4406.659
okay fishermen in the Box interesting I

4403.58 --> 4406.659
never heard of that

4417.64 --> 4422.7390000000005
don't exactly know what you're talking

4419.719 --> 4426.8
about but I was talking about basically

4422.739 --> 4428.659
a heavy heavy Improvement upon the vomit

4426.8 --> 4431.96
Comet system

4428.659 --> 4433.699
using a big tunnel in rock and using a

4431.96 --> 4436.46
maglev

4433.699 --> 4439.5199999999995
instead of Wheels

4436.46 --> 4441.62
right to minimize friction and to

4439.52 --> 4445.219
maximize stabilization of the

4441.62 --> 4448.28
trajectories while it's going

4445.219 --> 4451.28
also minimize the amount of vibration

4448.28 --> 4451.28
resonance

4451.34 --> 4456.14
so that well the thing can literally

4454.4 --> 4459.58
just

4456.14 --> 4459.58
fall parabolically

4460.52 --> 4466.06
and Achieve like perfect zero g

4463.46 --> 4466.06
Stillness

4467.42 --> 4471.7390000000005
which of course the vomit Comet does not

4470.239 --> 4474.379999999999
perfectly achieve because it's

4471.739 --> 4476.5
constantly it has issues with tremors

4474.38 --> 4480.56
and with

4476.5 --> 4483.28
uh with turbulence right

4480.56 --> 4487.2390000000005
so that's basically that's like that

4483.28 --> 4487.239
that's the idea behind it

4493.699 --> 4498.62
right it's not literally like I'm not

4495.92 --> 4501.26
trying to engineer like oh no we you can

4498.62 --> 4504.08
use magnets and then have like a Still

4501.26 --> 4506.4800000000005
Standing like a stationary system in

4504.08 --> 4508.94
which you have grg no absolutely not

4506.48 --> 4511.419999999999
even close nothing like that

4508.94 --> 4514.099999999999
not figuring out some special

4511.42 --> 4517.6
anti-gravity blah blah blah

4514.1 --> 4517.6
this is just a simulator

yeah

4555.98 --> 4561.639999999999
I've seen those really weird but

4559.1 --> 4561.64
interesting

4573.08 --> 4579.86
I still remember there was a sci-fi

4575.179 --> 4583.46
movie that had it which one was that

4579.86 --> 4585.099999999999
I think it was the uh

4583.46 --> 4588.249
call again

4585.1 --> 4588.249000000001
[Music]

4594.679 --> 4602.12
there was a sci-fi movie made after a

4598.219 --> 4603.92
very famous sci-fi anime

4602.12 --> 4606.199
uh

4603.92 --> 4608.84
with the guy who has no eyes but like

4606.199 --> 4613.219
these robot eyes things

4608.84 --> 4616.58
she's like a robot too sort of

4613.219 --> 4619.34
what's it called again but yeah if I

4616.58 --> 4621.44
remember correctly in like the live

4619.34 --> 4623.360000000001
action movie of that

4621.44 --> 4625.46
can't remember the name sorry about that

4623.36 --> 4628.159
it's pretty famous though

4625.46 --> 4630.62
I they have I remember seeing that they

4628.159 --> 4632.96
had like lifts too that did that like

4630.62 --> 4635.62
just blocks that would slide along

4632.96 --> 4639.94
buildings and [ __ ] like vertical

4635.62 --> 4639.94
horizontal it was really interesting

4642.679 --> 4648.02
what's that movie wasn't it

4645.26 --> 4649.820000000001
ah or some other sci-fi movie I remember

4648.02 --> 4651.26
seeing things like that it was really

4649.82 --> 4659.46
like fascinating

4726.679 --> 4730.179
well-known [ __ ]

4750.219 --> 4753.34
all right

4762.52 --> 4768.580000000001
ah damn it wow that took long enough

4765.32 --> 4768.58
yeah Ghost in the Shell

4770.06 --> 4772.9400000000005
five minutes

4772.94 --> 4777.678999999999
Sixth Element that's hilarious not

4775.219 --> 4779.78
minority well Minority Report had

4777.679 --> 4783.5
another interesting way of approaching

4779.78 --> 4786.44
it with basically the Mac left type cars

4783.5 --> 4788.719
which was yeah it was basically also

4786.44 --> 4791.54
like a maglev system

4788.719 --> 4794.179
but very different they use it as a

4791.54 --> 4796.4
maglev Highway which was like really

4794.179 --> 4798.56
fascinating the way they made that in

4796.4 --> 4800.0599999999995
that movie but no I think I was talking

4798.56 --> 4802.04
about

4800.06 --> 4804.1990000000005
Ghost in the Shell but I'm not sure

4802.04 --> 4806.0
anymore it's kind of frustrating it

4804.199 --> 4808.159
might have been some weird obscure

4806.0 --> 4810.44
sci-fi movie that I have absolutely

4808.159 --> 4813.639999999999
don't even know

4810.44 --> 4813.639999999999
what it was anymore

4814.64 --> 4818.679
remember seeing that in my head

4820.46 --> 4825.199
I really thought it was Ghost in the

4822.38 --> 4827.4800000000005
Shell the movie like the action the

4825.199 --> 4829.5199999999995
live-action movie but anyway

4827.48 --> 4833.139999999999
self-driving yes

4829.52 --> 4833.14
yes they were self-driving

4834.56 --> 4840.4400000000005
you basically just set your destination

4837.32 --> 4844.299999999999
and then the car would just go there

4840.44 --> 4844.299999999999
that's how it worked in Minority Report

4847.76 --> 4851.900000000001
unless you got off the maglev and then

4850.219 --> 4855.04
you could actually kind of use the

4851.9 --> 4855.04
wheels and just drive

4856.1 --> 4859.06
on the road

4859.88 --> 4865.96
it was pretty ingenious how they how

4863.12 --> 4865.96
they envisioned that

4866.0 --> 4868.6
anyway

really basic cars that kind of looked

4940.159 --> 4947.839999999999
weird and futuristic boxy like

4943.64 --> 4947.84
nothing really spectacular

4948.38 --> 4953.38

still got another half hour to go

keep coming up with this type of thing

5056.86 --> 5062.739
don't I

5059.679 --> 5064.9800000000005
just all these like projects you could

5062.739 --> 5064.98
do

5065.02 --> 5067.92
my weird

5070.3 --> 5074.9800000000005
what did I call it again

5072.699 --> 5079.12
with the whole

5074.98 --> 5081.5199999999995
private space car park system it was

5079.12 --> 5086.34
also like a project

5081.52 --> 5086.34
right but this is also a project

5090.28 --> 5095.04
just something that could be done

5103.14 --> 5111.360000000001
Drive in private space that's what it

5107.44 --> 5111.36
was called yeah yeah still like the name

5124.54 --> 5130.0199999999995

only make sense

5173.62 --> 5179.0199999999995
man I think that dude I'm I'm thinking

5176.38 --> 5181.179
again about the space simulator maglev

5179.02 --> 5183.400000000001
coaster

5181.179 --> 5185.4
I mean it

5183.4 --> 5190.08
you could make that

5185.4 --> 5190.08
quite a spectacular experience

5190.719 --> 5194.139
I mean you could like have the parabolic

5192.88 --> 5197.92
flight

5194.139 --> 5201.639
not just like perfectly like the whole

5197.92 --> 5205.4800000000005
path of the coaster the tunnel

5201.639 --> 5208.2390000000005
not just to be perfectly parabolic and

5205.48 --> 5210.699
just get that zero g as much as possible

5208.239 --> 5214.36
and then some kind of dead Hall but no

5210.699 --> 5218.04
you could even like make it

5214.36 --> 5222.639
go like this and then eventually like

5218.04 --> 5226.179
very slowly smooth it up what the [ __ ]

5222.639 --> 5230.38
is off with this [ __ ] YouTube

5226.179 --> 5233.04
why is it screwing around all the time

5230.38 --> 5233.04
God

5234.34 --> 5237.82
like are you guys having this is just

5236.32 --> 5240.46
constantly

5237.82 --> 5244.9
breaking up and [ __ ]

5240.46 --> 5247.2390000000005
ah sorry but you could have it

5244.9 --> 5250.48
like first zero g

5247.239 --> 5254.5
simulation for as long as possible and

5250.48 --> 5255.82
then the last part like the last quarter

5254.5 --> 5258.88
of the ride

5255.82 --> 5262.0599999999995
not just a continuation but instead like

5258.88 --> 5265.06
a slow

5262.06 --> 5267.179
slow decline so that it's not just like

5265.06 --> 5270.159000000001
oh I'm floating

5267.179 --> 5272.9800000000005
but instead it's like oh I'm floating

5270.159 --> 5275.259999999999
and then suddenly like oh there's a slow

5272.98 --> 5276.4
pool oh I'm slowly drifting to the

5275.26 --> 5280.96
ground

5276.4 --> 5285.159
and then like that the gravity

5280.96 --> 5287.679
experience like really slowly comes back

5285.159 --> 5289.42
like with perfect subtlety I mean that

5287.679 --> 5291.82
would be one hell of an experience

5289.42 --> 5294.1
wouldn't it

5291.82 --> 5296.5599999999995
you have to like really carefully

5294.1 --> 5299.76
designed the tunnel trajectory before

5296.56 --> 5299.76
you start digging it

5302.38 --> 5306.82
um okay you guys are not having any

5304.48 --> 5310.0199999999995
problems good maybe it's just YouTube

5306.82 --> 5310.0199999999995
trying to screw with me

5310.239 --> 5312.839999999999
ah

5313.6 --> 5317.92
but I mean that that would be pretty

5315.46 --> 5320.02
badass wouldn't it I'm really like

5317.92 --> 5323.34
thinking about

5320.02 --> 5323.34
the design of this ride

5331.96 --> 5337.719
[Music]

5334.719 --> 5337.719
foreign

5348.82 --> 5355.0599999999995
have you ever thought about writing a

5351.04 --> 5358.3
Sci-Fi story no but I do sometimes just

5355.06 --> 5360.780000000001
write sci-fi stories but really little

5358.3 --> 5360.78
ones

5361.36 --> 5365.38
I mean I had a whole like micro series

5364.06 --> 5368.92
like a

5365.38 --> 5372.04
a few pages with like

5368.92 --> 5375.4800000000005
what is it three sentence

5372.04 --> 5375.48
micro stories

5377.199 --> 5381.96
remember like my my time-based thing

5382.0 --> 5389.5
this whole weird time travel system game

5386.26 --> 5392.1990000000005
even that's also very compatible for

5389.5 --> 5396.54
stories like that was years ago that I

5392.199 --> 5396.54
made that in like 2014 I think

5398.679 --> 5404.08
but the thing is that every time I write

5402.04 --> 5406.48
it's like oh I'm going to write a book

5404.08 --> 5409.6
and then it's just like yeah no no I

5406.48 --> 5411.58
just wrote a page and that page is

5409.6 --> 5414.52
literally like reading an entire book

5411.58 --> 5416.739
except it's just a page

5414.52 --> 5420.219
this is just kind of how I ended up

5416.739 --> 5423.28
writing like that's how I do it

5420.219 --> 5426.88
I've just lost the patience for all the

5423.28 --> 5429.099999999999
endless padding and blabbering

5426.88 --> 5430.0
I'm just like no just get straight to

5429.1 --> 5433.360000000001
the point

5430.0 --> 5437.8
like if you could just summarize like an

5433.36 --> 5441.04
entire period of time in three words

5437.8 --> 5443.320000000001
without actually losing oversight or

5441.04 --> 5445.48
cohesion as to its implication in the

5443.32 --> 5448.799999999999
rest of the story right I mean that's

5445.48 --> 5448.799999999999
kind of how I write now

5452.32 --> 5459.46
I don't do padding anymore

5455.98 --> 5462.718999999999
no more like slow approach

5459.46 --> 5462.719
just no

5465.1 --> 5469.3
and by the way what I showed yesterday

5467.08 --> 5471.58
that text

5469.3 --> 5473.860000000001
is written like that too there's no

5471.58 --> 5477.5199999999995
padding it's all to the point

5473.86 --> 5480.639
like that eight pages of history of one

5477.52 --> 5483.52
city yeah guess what that eight pages

5480.639 --> 5486.46
every part of it is all strictly

5483.52 --> 5490.080000000001
directly to the point yeah that's how

5486.46 --> 5490.08
freaking big that history is

5491.139 --> 5493.7390000000005
hmm

5495.719 --> 5500.44
I could read a page of that

5498.46 --> 5502.12
just to see what it's like it's in

5500.44 --> 5505.0
English by the way because I write

5502.12 --> 5507.82
everything in English always have

5505.0 --> 5509.38
actually since I I grabbed that out of

5507.82 --> 5510.88
the closet I've been kind of curious as

5509.38 --> 5513.659000000001
to like

5510.88 --> 5513.659000000001
read it

5517.9 --> 5522.099999999999
although a lot of it just will contain

5520.12 --> 5525.0
names that will mean absolutely nothing

5522.1 --> 5525.0
to anybody here

5526.0 --> 5528.179
foreign

5529.61 --> 5534.25
[Music]

5544.46 --> 5547.4890000000005
[Music]

5551.26 --> 5557.400000000001
it's super descriptive and it's all

5553.42 --> 5557.4
using just these names as snap

5558.28 --> 5563.08
but I bet that if I like set up a role

5561.4 --> 5565.659
play and I'm not going to unfortunately

5563.08 --> 5568.0
for you guys if I'd set up like a

5565.659 --> 5570.28
role-playing game in this world

5568.0 --> 5574.62
and after playing them out I'll bet your

5570.28 --> 5574.62
ass you're gonna want to read this [ __ ]

5578.72 --> 5581.919
[Music]

5582.88 --> 5589.2390000000005
this is kind of funny though

5586.3 --> 5591.6
how much did I write with the new

5589.239 --> 5591.599999999999
version

5605.02 --> 5609.219
yeah I didn't really write any text at

5608.139 --> 5611.56
this one

5609.219 --> 5614.04
did I

5611.56 --> 5617.56
except for just the story

5614.04 --> 5620.86
reports that are still in text it's like

5617.56 --> 5622.26
a hundred Pages or something

5620.86 --> 5625.659
foreign

5622.26 --> 5627.9400000000005
yeah I never wrote down any texts

5625.659 --> 5628.9
for the newer campaign I was just kind

5627.94 --> 5632.5
of like

5628.9 --> 5635.379999999999
making it on the spot a lot more

5632.5 --> 5638.26
but with the older campaign

5635.38 --> 5640.719
with this one I wasn't I was literally

5638.26 --> 5643.0
just trying to write an entire world

5640.719 --> 5646.42
into existence

5643.0 --> 5648.639
and then afterwards sort of subjective

5646.42 --> 5650.92
players into it so it's very different

5648.639 --> 5653.92
development process

5650.92 --> 5653.92
foreign

5675.96 --> 5680.86
you do come up with ideas that would fit

5678.88 --> 5682.96
the genre I know

5680.86 --> 5684.639
got plenty ideas I got all kinds of

5682.96 --> 5688.42
ideas too because

5684.639 --> 5692.4400000000005
my ideas for space space Bridge

5688.42 --> 5695.26
that's been out there for a while and

5692.44 --> 5697.178999999999
all time Travel how that would work how

5695.26 --> 5699.280000000001
it would start like through the spirit

5697.179 --> 5701.7390000000005
internally

5699.28 --> 5704.46
and that then eventually potentially

5701.739 --> 5707.5599999999995
some kind of weird

5704.46 --> 5710.38
electromagnetic device could be figured

5707.56 --> 5713.46
out on how to actually physically take

5710.38 --> 5713.46
your whole body there

5714.4 --> 5720.879999999999
but that would then in accordance to

5718.12 --> 5724.54
that sci-fi story that I wrote it would

5720.88 --> 5726.76
disrupt literally the stability of exist

5724.54 --> 5729.219
of physical existence itself

5726.76 --> 5732.76
and so like the Paradox would start to

5729.219 --> 5735.159
creep up on you wherever you go then

5732.76 --> 5740.34
and basically consume the entire world

5735.159 --> 5740.339999999999
it was quite dark in ways

5748.9 --> 5753.099999999999
which is by the way kind of weird too

5751.36 --> 5756.839999999999
because

5753.1 --> 5759.76
there is like this German Sci-Fi

5756.84 --> 5761.62
time-based series I think it's called

5759.76 --> 5763.780000000001
Dark too

5761.62 --> 5766.12
and they really

5763.78 --> 5768.159
I don't yeah I don't know who was first

5766.12 --> 5770.92
I didn't know about that series when I

5768.159 --> 5772.9
was writing a little sci-fi piece but it

5770.92 --> 5775.659
it kind of had the same feel it's like

5772.9 --> 5777.638999999999
time has doomed them all

5775.659 --> 5779.92
like the meddling with time has

5777.639 --> 5781.0
basically locked everything up in a

5779.92 --> 5783.6990000000005
paradox

5781.0 --> 5786.1
and that was a part of the spirit of my

5783.699 --> 5788.799999999999
story as well so it was kind of

5786.1 --> 5791.1990000000005
fascinating to see someone else out

5788.8 --> 5794.219
there having actually manifested it and

5791.199 --> 5794.219
turned it into a series

5801.94 --> 5807.299999999999
rip Justina yeah I'll see you later

5803.98 --> 5807.299999999999
thanks for popping by

5811.78 --> 5817.96
do your sci-fi store short stories

5815.46 --> 5820.56
explore both flat and Globe Earth

5817.96 --> 5820.56
storylines

5822.159 --> 5825.0599999999995
no

5829.12 --> 5835.659
I haven't really engaged in actually

5831.699 --> 5838.0
writing stories about well my

5835.659 --> 5840.82
cosmogonical ideas

5838.0 --> 5843.04
but there's other stories out there that

5840.82 --> 5843.84
have

5843.04 --> 5846.82
like

5843.84 --> 5849.28
one of the more surprising ones is like

5846.82 --> 5851.5199999999995
a role-playing system what's it called

5849.28 --> 5851.5199999999995
again

5854.62 --> 5856.62
um

5857.56 --> 5860.400000000001
damn it

5859.3 --> 5863.38
damn it

5860.4 --> 5865.42
I don't remember

5863.38 --> 5868.2390000000005
there's a role-playing system that

5865.42 --> 5870.58
basically had like

5868.239 --> 5871.9
other planes

5870.58 --> 5874.0599999999995
from like

5871.9 --> 5876.5199999999995
it was all flat plain it's all

5874.06 --> 5879.34
interconnected and they had the setting

5876.52 --> 5882.639
it wasn't overt but where it's like like

5879.34 --> 5886.12
the atlanteans return from their

5882.639 --> 5888.58
continent and they basically enter our

5886.12 --> 5889.84
continent and that's the setting of the

5888.58 --> 5893.1
role-playing game

5889.84 --> 5893.1
what's it called again

5893.92 --> 5898.34
don't remember

5894.95 --> 5898.34
[Music]

5900.94 --> 5904.739
so there there are

5905.26 --> 5911.62
sci-fi type systems and role-playing

5908.62 --> 5914.62
games and that do kind of explore off

5911.62 --> 5917.0199999999995
just like they don't mention Globe Earth

5914.62 --> 5918.46
or anything or another planet it's just

5917.02 --> 5920.860000000001
like oh there turn out to be another

5918.46 --> 5923.26
continent and that's it right so there's

5920.86 --> 5924.82
like oh just stick another continent

5923.26 --> 5926.38
there you go you got a science fiction

5924.82 --> 5928.92
universe

5926.38 --> 5931.659000000001
and yeah I mean

5928.92 --> 5934.42
who's there to stop you it is the Earth

5931.659 --> 5936.339999999999
is flat there might be more continents

5934.42 --> 5939.219
that we're not aware of and there might

5936.34 --> 5941.26
also be even a loop like it that can be

5939.219 --> 5944.62
opened like a gate where suddenly an

5941.26 --> 5947.7390000000005
entirely new region is just revealed

5944.62 --> 5950.139
connected to our region

5947.739 --> 5953.379999999999
so

5950.139 --> 5956.26
but thus far I mostly just stick to

5953.38 --> 5958.6
attempting to describe these effects

5956.26 --> 5963.04
instead of building a story with it

5958.6 --> 5967.0
because just describing these things

5963.04 --> 5970.36
like what I just said the loop and then

5967.0 --> 5972.58
the loop opening up to to connect to a

5970.36 --> 5975.699
new region

5972.58 --> 5977.86
that's really difficult to even follow

5975.699 --> 5979.48
what I was just trying to describe in

5977.86 --> 5981.159
your mind that's difficult

5979.48 --> 5984.218999999999
maybe for you guys that have been

5981.159 --> 5986.5
following me for quite a while that goes

5984.219 --> 5989.38
easier for you but for any Outsiders

5986.5 --> 5991.54
like what the hell did he just say

5989.38 --> 5993.1
really

5991.54 --> 5996.94
like

5993.1 --> 5999.639
so if you just incorporate that's kind

5996.94 --> 6002.28
of like really complicated mechanism in

5999.639 --> 6004.8
the story it would just go over people's

6002.28 --> 6006.84
head they wouldn't understand it

6004.8 --> 6010.139
they would just say like oh oh so it's

6006.84 --> 6012.3
like a gate it's like a portal right

6010.139 --> 6015.06
that's what would happen they wouldn't

6012.3 --> 6017.46
get anything about it but what I was

6015.06 --> 6019.1990000000005
describing there if I was describing

6017.46 --> 6020.46
like the loop opening they wouldn't get

6019.199 --> 6023.099999999999
it

6020.46 --> 6024.84
we just say oh so it's like a gate in a

6023.1 --> 6026.46
special way of describing it they

6024.84 --> 6028.5
wouldn't understand what I was actually

6026.46 --> 6031.92
describing so that

6028.5 --> 6034.32
why mostly stick to just describing it

6031.92 --> 6036.36
here on my show

6034.32 --> 6037.98
describing what is it like what's

6036.36 --> 6040.94
happening there what I what I think

6037.98 --> 6040.94
could be possible

6046.56 --> 6051.719
right and no I don't waste my time

6049.139 --> 6054.92
writing about Globe stories

6051.719 --> 6054.92
I never really have

6056.31 --> 6062.52
[Music]

6057.96 --> 6065.219
except for like hyper sci-fi

6062.52 --> 6067.8
but that's all that's like it's

6065.219 --> 6070.9800000000005
basically post human sci-fi

6067.8 --> 6074.1
which is kind of like transhuman really

6070.98 --> 6075.9
and pointless but I've had I some ideas

6074.1 --> 6078.659000000001
about that

6075.9 --> 6082.92
like how

6078.659 --> 6086.719
basically people would become digitized

6082.92 --> 6086.719
in like a matrix

6086.94 --> 6090.299999999999
but like by their own volition that

6088.98 --> 6092.879999999999
they're literally they have a physical

6090.3 --> 6096.119000000001
body in a pod

6092.88 --> 6098.159000000001
by choice and then that pause just

6096.119 --> 6100.98
connected into the Matrix and you can

6098.159 --> 6104.699
leave it again but that eventually like

6100.98 --> 6106.799999999999
the world goes to cataclysm like the

6104.699 --> 6109.678999999999
global warming or something [ __ ]

6106.8 --> 6110.58
right and then they have to go into the

6109.679 --> 6112.619
pods

6110.58 --> 6114.78
and then eventually I thought of like

6112.619 --> 6117.48
yeah what would it be like if then they

6114.78 --> 6119.58
basically all took their pods and

6117.48 --> 6121.5599999999995
launched it off into space and then

6119.58 --> 6123.5
would be like almost like a Battle Star

6121.56 --> 6129.38
Galactica

6123.5 --> 6129.38
space journey except in a matrix spot

6130.619 --> 6139.0199999999995
yeah where people know it like it's not

6135.06 --> 6140.6990000000005
a secret Matrix an occult Matrix where

6139.02 --> 6144.0
the people aren't told that they're in

6140.699 --> 6146.759999999999
the Matrix but it's like their thing

6144.0 --> 6149.4
it's like their social media

6146.76 --> 6151.619000000001
right super Advanced holographics you

6149.4 --> 6153.599999999999
could call people would just like plug

6151.619 --> 6156.0
in and just do

6153.6 --> 6157.679
and that would be the typical virtue

6156.0 --> 6160.92
environment that they would live in and

6157.679 --> 6162.139
they would also be well built

6160.92 --> 6164.6990000000005
or

6162.139 --> 6166.679
pre-engineered or whatever genetics I

6164.699 --> 6168.239
don't know where it would go in order to

6166.679 --> 6170.04
just be able to do that all the time

6168.239 --> 6171.718999999999
without like degenerating and getting

6170.04 --> 6174.54
sick

6171.719 --> 6176.219
and how they would then in that virtual

6174.54 --> 6180.179
world

6176.219 --> 6182.76
like pods in a big spaceship like go out

6180.179 --> 6185.04
and try to find another place

6182.76 --> 6188.219
so it's sort of like a Battle Star

6185.04 --> 6191.0
Galactica story but like more hyper

6188.219 --> 6191.0
sci-fi Tech

6191.34 --> 6197.9400000000005
I've conceived that idea like in

6194.94 --> 6197.94
2012.

6202.86 --> 6209.659
I mean that could make a setting for

6205.5 --> 6209.659
some like cyber Tech

6210.48 --> 6214.919999999999
series

6211.86 --> 6218.1089999999995
or a movie whatever

6214.92 --> 6218.109
[Music]

6222.92 --> 6231.32
Tales From The Flat Earth what the [ __ ]

6226.38 --> 6231.32
I know what do you mean Ward a winning

6233.88 --> 6236.42
what

6236.86 --> 6240.61
[Music]

6251.159 --> 6253.28
what

6255.96 --> 6260.659
what the [ __ ] does that have to do with

6258.179 --> 6260.659
flat Earth

6276.42 --> 6279.42
okay

6284.82 --> 6287.54
huh

6288.6 --> 6294.119000000001
okay it seems kind of like a DND type

6292.679 --> 6296.52
Realm

6294.119 --> 6299.639
but why the [ __ ] would they call it flat

6296.52 --> 6301.4400000000005
Earth though that's just weird I mean

6299.639 --> 6305.159000000001
uh

6301.44 --> 6308.04
I have the manual of the planes from

6305.159 --> 6312.54
Dungeons and Dragons

6308.04 --> 6315.659
and they don't call it flat even though

6312.54 --> 6318.48
it's literally visually flat even drawn

6315.659 --> 6320.339999999999
as flat like floating flat Islands in

6318.48 --> 6322.86
nothing and [ __ ] so

6320.34 --> 6326.58
why the hell did they call that Flat

6322.86 --> 6326.58
Earth I mean what

6328.98 --> 6336.48
how the hell did that ever win is a

6333.06 --> 6338.6990000000005
win an award with that name like what

6336.48 --> 6339.9
what the [ __ ] is going on steamy

6338.699 --> 6343.638999999999
Traveler

6339.9 --> 6343.638999999999
where the hell did you dig that up

6349.139 --> 6354.38
and how the hell did that ever win a one

6352.02 --> 6354.38
award

people in chat when I just don't get a

6447.96 --> 6451.28
response at all that's great

6451.44 --> 6457.32

6454.02 --> 6459.96
what you guys say do I oh yes that's

6457.32 --> 6462.0
exactly what I do constantly

6459.96 --> 6463.86
and then I ask questions and then I

6462.0 --> 6465.659
don't get a response and it's kind of

6463.86 --> 6468.739
frustrating

6465.659 --> 6468.739
