this even or yesterday night yeah there

86.85 --> 93.33
was a bit of a storm almost felt like it

90.69 --> 103.97
was gonna get colder again but yeah that

93.33 --> 103.97
didn't last for long hot

105.289 --> 108.289
yeah

109.51 --> 117.97
it's just advertisement for swimming

112.21 --> 123.63999999999999

117.97 --> 129.78
have a a great income these couple of

123.64 --> 133.99
days so yeah hello everyone I have water

129.78 --> 138.13
but it was so cold that it was almost

133.99 --> 140.56
frozen just from being in my in my

138.13 --> 142.6
cooler I guess because the back of it

140.56 --> 145.93
was pretty much against the cooling

142.6 --> 153.09
element and it was so cold I took a

145.93 --> 153.09
glass of it almost froze my teeth off

155.04 --> 165.79
nothing better than cold filtered water

162.21 --> 168.04000000000002
Cheers so I got that and I got a couple

165.79 --> 172.29
of blueberries that's it I'm not getting

168.04 --> 172.29
Tamera coffee today definitely no tea

176.74 --> 188.65
I got some lemonade but it's still in

181.96 --> 192.09
the cooler mm-hmm I'm thinking hold on

188.65 --> 192.09
I'll be right back

232.62 --> 241.6
right yes sir for the day I just thought

236.4 --> 243.34
if I just put the lemonade bottle in the

241.6 --> 247.06
same way I did the water then it'll

243.34 --> 248.86
probably cool a lot quicker so you're

247.06 --> 253.18
good to see everyone sorry for being a

248.86 --> 255.06900000000002
bit late it's just that everything takes

253.18 --> 256.98900000000003
more time it's weird

255.069 --> 261.549
so I thought okay I'll just quickly

256.989 --> 263.5
smoke of a sticky small joint and it

261.549 --> 269.31
just took longer than I thought it would

263.5 --> 273.18
weird this heat I guess hmm

269.31 --> 273.18
let's you isn't yet

275.94 --> 285.86
okay stone monkey 3d was an early Steve

281.0 --> 292.8
over moco matthäus the walking witness

285.86 --> 295.16
or Mathias I mean gaining wisdom mana

292.8 --> 295.16
young

296.12 --> 313.94
Fyodor Dostoevsky HM more colored and a

305.22 --> 313.94000000000005
bear Louise yeah good to see you all so

315.59 --> 324.41999999999996
yeah I'm I don't know how good of an

321.65 --> 328.2
early bird show it's gonna be today like

324.42 --> 332.0
yesterday it's just so hot I with this

328.2 --> 335.7
kind of heat I can barely sleep because

332.0 --> 341.01
around 2 o'clock at night the

335.7 --> 343.05
temperature became good enough that it's

341.01 --> 347.82
even like you could even consider

343.05 --> 354.36
sleeping in it for me very early on it

347.82 --> 356.19
just started warming up again and it's

354.36 --> 359.82
just too warm for me to properly

356.19 --> 363.27
function so I'm almost half asleep half

359.82 --> 365.49
of that it's weird like I I'm just doing

363.27 --> 373.52
things but I'm really tired but I can't

365.49 --> 373.52
sleep and I'll manage but I'm just like

374.78 --> 378.46
I know

386.72 --> 391.79
there's a lot of people out there by the

388.49 --> 396.14
way now being very very happy having

391.79 --> 397.67
aired air-conditioner because in a lot

396.14 --> 401.53999999999996
of the stores that I go to they

397.67 --> 405.98
definitely do have that so makes

401.54 --> 408.59000000000003
shopping kind of almost you got to do it

405.98 --> 410.75
just to get an excuse to get in the

408.59 --> 416.95
air-conditioned store and cool off for a

410.75 --> 416.95
moment but anyway I got some blueberries

422.799 --> 435.82899999999995
very good stuff I do notice that even in

430.849 --> 438.409
past years like if last year or when was

435.829 --> 448.159
that year when it was incredibly hot in

438.409 --> 453.469
the in May I think because I now eat

448.159 --> 455.659
vegetarian that I'm having less negative

453.469 --> 458.719
side effects which is really nice

455.659 --> 468.469
because when it's this hot normally I

458.719 --> 470.80899999999997
get more negative side effects I don't

468.469 --> 474.289
know like heat rashes more people get

470.809 --> 476.389
that kind of thing I don't have it i

474.289 --> 479.329
yeah I'm sweating the hell out of

476.389 --> 481.099
everything that's kind of a bit

479.329 --> 482.479
embarrassing at times because it just

481.099 --> 486.979
keeps on going and going and going

482.479 --> 490.849
doesn't it looks surreal like even in a

486.979 --> 493.159
in in a air-conditioned store it just

490.849 --> 495.11
keeps on going to go and go it can stand

493.159 --> 499.699
there for ten minutes and it will just

495.11 --> 501.86
keep on going it's surreal and I feel a

499.699 --> 503.839
little bit weird because of that because

501.86 --> 507.379
there's not that many people you see

503.839 --> 508.939
that they're just that yeah just keep on

507.379 --> 512.059
sweating like that or I don't know maybe

508.939 --> 514.399
I don't know why I have this I've always

512.059 --> 515.99
had this my whole life I thought it's

514.399 --> 520.24
always I always thought it was annoying

515.99 --> 523.24
and it made me prefer to be in cooler

520.24 --> 523.24
situations

532.18 --> 541.04
although I i've never had trouble for

536.779 --> 544.43
example with the Sun I'm not allergic to

541.04 --> 547.759
the Sun that I have to cover up or put

544.43 --> 549.8599999999999
in all the sun blockers because

547.759 --> 554.1800000000001
otherwise I'll turn into a lobster I

549.86 --> 559.399
don't have that with me the problem is

554.18 --> 561.3789999999999
literally cooking so what is it called a

559.399 --> 565.519
heat stroke that for me that is

561.379 --> 570.259
potentially a serious risk if if I'm not

565.519 --> 574.22
careful like if I for some weird reason

570.259 --> 577.069
decided to get really drunk in the

574.22 --> 581.6
afternoon say with friends that I just

577.069 --> 583.639
got to know and yeah things happen you

581.6 --> 585.98
know and I'd get drunk and I'd like save

583.639 --> 589.189
somewhere on a balcony in this heat and

585.98 --> 590.779
with the alcohol kind of fall asleep

589.189 --> 593.12
well that could be extremely dangerous

590.779 --> 600.019
because then I could definitely get a

593.12 --> 602.149
heat stroke yeah more than others

600.019 --> 605.29
I think

602.149 --> 605.29
I don't know what it is

613.77 --> 619.17
Melony well what does melanin got to do

616.9 --> 619.17
with it

623.47 --> 632.14
well anyway I'm walking around like this

627.76 --> 638.29
and I'm not putting on any any kind of

632.14 --> 641.47
sunscreen normally if I let's say five

638.29 --> 643.63
six years ago if I'd go out and be a day

641.47 --> 649.72
out in the Sun then I'd probably bring

643.63 --> 653.86
some la Vera either juice or like a leaf

649.72 --> 657.5500000000001
and just put it on constantly or I take

653.86 --> 660.01
certain concentrate tablets because that

657.55 --> 663.25
works really well then you don't get

660.01 --> 665.92
sunburned and you don't have to put any

663.25 --> 667.9
blockers on that worked for me I don't

665.92 --> 670.81
know if it works for everyone I've had

667.9 --> 673.99
I've heard other stories of people who

670.81 --> 682.7199999999999
that works for including my father and

673.99 --> 684.82
his wife so but I haven't even needed to

682.72 --> 688.62
do that and maybe that is because I've

684.82 --> 691.24
been eating well organic berries and and

688.62 --> 694.0600000000001
that thing more often and I don't eat

691.24 --> 699.07
meat anymore because I really do think

694.06 --> 702.9399999999999
that since I've become vegetarian things

699.07 --> 703.3900000000001
like heat rash just totally gone hundred

702.94 --> 706.1500000000001
percent

703.39 --> 708.43
no no beginnings nothing it just doesn't

706.15 --> 712.54
manifest that feels very directly

708.43 --> 716.2299999999999
related to to the side effects of eating

712.54 --> 719.88
meat so that's one thing that I'm now

716.23 --> 719.88
realizing in this heatwave

728.12 --> 733.46
okay Ben Adams could be

735.81 --> 745.649
I think it all depends probably as a as

742.68 --> 750.06
you go all there and you become more

745.649 --> 752.189
vulnerable to sunburn I think for a lot

750.06 --> 756.8889999999999
of people that'll probably be the case

752.189 --> 756.889
not necessarily for everyone though

779.1 --> 786.48
you know that's interesting more colored

782.07 --> 791.1600000000001
yeah my mother was kind of like that as

786.48 --> 794.97
well she could burn very easily if she

791.16 --> 797.93
wasn't careful but if she approached

794.97 --> 800.1800000000001
getting a suntan very carefully and

797.93 --> 805.1099999999999
structured and paying a lot of attention

800.18 --> 810.4499999999999
then eventually yeah she'd get a proper

805.11 --> 813.69
tan and wouldn't have that anymore but

810.45 --> 815.76
if he got over-enthusiastic at the

813.69 --> 819.1800000000001
beginning of a holiday when we went to

815.76 --> 824.01
Spain for example then she'd get all

819.18 --> 829.1099999999999
burned and be very sad about it but

824.01 --> 831.92
after that then yet she get a proper tat

829.11 --> 836.54
and so she was kind of sensitive but not

831.92 --> 836.54
not super pale skin level

840.81 --> 849.9
and my dad yeah my dad can just handle

843.93 --> 854.79
any son although he can't get a burn

849.9 --> 856.8299999999999
though if he really doesn't pay

854.79 --> 860.79
attention and just sits in the Sun all

856.83 --> 863.82
day but he doesn't burn easily anyway

860.79 --> 868.02
and I'm seemed to be more towards my

863.82 --> 870.5600000000001
dad's skin type I had it and I kind of

868.02 --> 870.56
glad of it

885.27 --> 894.5699999999999
don't wear sunglasses stops you burning

888.75 --> 896.97
oh you mean that if you had a maken if

894.57 --> 900.0600000000001
you wear sunglasses then you'll be more

896.97 --> 904.4590000000001
inclined to forget that you may be

900.06 --> 904.459
burning like that right

921.14 --> 933.6899999999999
Falcon now activated charcoal experiment

925.31 --> 936.829
what probably not too long

933.69 --> 936.8290000000001
[Music]

951.39 --> 954.23
really

955.86 --> 959.87
that's interesting Adam Eakin

963.85 --> 968.85
I have worn sunglasses at time and I can

967.12 --> 972.3
say that there are definitely

968.85 --> 974.6800000000001
psychosomatic consequences

972.3 --> 979.89
psychologically at least so I wouldn't

974.68 --> 986.62
be surprised I never wear sunglasses

979.89 --> 988.93
I've always avoided that I don't know

986.62 --> 995.8
why maybe because I want people to be

988.93 --> 1001.1099999999999
able to look me in the eye to test me if

995.8 --> 1002.91
if they wanted to and there's a lot of

1001.11 --> 1009.1800000000001
people that are literally just hiding

1002.91 --> 1011.6
behind sunglasses and I don't want to be

1009.18 --> 1011.5999999999999
one of them

1029.91 --> 1032.48
Wow

1033.41 --> 1041.47
I am mr. Pendlebury you have photophobia

1037.63 --> 1041.47
what is that

1044.53 --> 1048.329
that sounds extremely convoluted

1061.86 --> 1067.37
what what is either Lukie Kalin I have

1065.34 --> 1071.6999999999998
no idea

1067.37 --> 1073.9499999999998
look guys for starters it's perfectly

1071.7 --> 1076.89
fine everything but I'm not gonna be as

1073.95 --> 1081.51
quick as usual because with this heater

1076.89 --> 1083.13
I'm just gonna be very slow so if I

1081.51 --> 1086.179
didn't pay too much attention please

1083.13 --> 1086.179
excuse me for that

1090.71 --> 1097.8500000000001
whoa I don't know what lens lenses law

1095.84 --> 1100.12
is really never heard of that looky

1097.85 --> 1100.12
Kayla

1125.65 --> 1136.0590000000002
oh yeah by the way is just a side now

1128.47 --> 1141.73
did anyone like get the feeling just

1136.059 --> 1146.8
like me that Muller was literally during

1141.73 --> 1151.21
that report just but what is it

1146.8 --> 1155.53
fleeing ignorance and that is a an

1151.21 --> 1159.4
actual tactic I've seen politic I

1155.53 --> 1165.3999999999999
remember vividly politicians from my

1159.4 --> 1167.5590000000002
country doing that as well and how

1165.4 --> 1170.3200000000002
bizarre I thought it was always when

1167.559 --> 1173.32
they do it when they literally like yeah

1170.32 --> 1176.29
you're responsible for it all you're the

1173.32 --> 1179.26
one that supposedly wrote it and then

1176.29 --> 1180.97
they're like yeah I don't really know

1179.26 --> 1183.73
after double check with the thing that I

1180.97 --> 1188.679
supposedly wrote and it seems so

1183.73 --> 1191.559
ridiculous but that is a tactic that's

1188.679 --> 1196.17
literally one of the boxes they can

1191.559 --> 1196.17
choose when they approach the situation

1196.29 --> 1202.21
didn't you notice it

1198.929 --> 1207.6100000000001
it was very persistent and I'm I'm

1202.21 --> 1212.25
almost kind of disappointed that the

1207.61 --> 1215.05
right-wing isn't picking up on it and

1212.25 --> 1219.25
trying to make him look foolish for it

1215.05 --> 1221.71
when he obviously is not that stupid

1219.25 --> 1227.5
and is literally following a playbook

1221.71 --> 1230.32
tactic he's acting like he's an idiot

1227.5 --> 1234.55
and innocent and it all got mucked up

1230.32 --> 1237.3
that's the that's the resulting image

1234.55 --> 1239.98
that comes from from it that'll roll out

1237.3 --> 1240.96
whoever picks up on it will pick up on

1239.98 --> 1245.23
it

1240.96 --> 1250.29
it's wizardry it it changes it switches

1245.23 --> 1254.35
around how people look at the situation

1250.29 --> 1256.57
that are not really deeply into how it

1254.35 --> 1258.84
all works people still talk about it

1256.57 --> 1258.84
though

1259.12 --> 1263.35
so that that's what that is

1264.55 --> 1284.8999999999999
in a way it is pandering indeed so what

1280.31 --> 1287.69
it makes me feel like is like Trump

1284.9 --> 1291.94
basically made a deal with the deep

1287.69 --> 1296.81
state like yes you are gonna go down and

1291.94 --> 1300.8300000000002
if you're gonna make it harder I will be

1296.81 --> 1304.61
more brutal on you and if you're just

1300.83 --> 1307.73
gonna be smooth you can still hold up

1304.61 --> 1311.1799999999998
your image of how you oh I am the enemy

1307.73 --> 1315.38
you know that but as long as you don't

1311.18 --> 1320.5700000000002
do more damage and just go down in your

1315.38 --> 1325.4
way and save face for your 90-84 crowd

1320.57 --> 1330.6399999999999
as it were then yeah I'm not gonna give

1325.4 --> 1332.8700000000001
you the chair that kind of I would that

1330.64 --> 1336.2
that would be logical that they're

1332.87 --> 1338.11
basically the Democratic Party just

1336.2 --> 1341.66
seems to be wasting everyone's time

1338.11 --> 1345.58
there's no real new spirit there's no

1341.66 --> 1348.8300000000002
viable new option there's no it's all

1345.58 --> 1353.29
they just try out new hypes but they

1348.83 --> 1353.29
don't have any substance anymore

1355.38 --> 1362.679
and I wonder sometimes if they're really

1359.14 --> 1365.5200000000002
just trying or if what we get to see is

1362.679 --> 1369.6100000000001
more done out of boredom and and

1365.52 --> 1372.549
arrogance rather than actual structured

1369.61 --> 1376.6
plans because there don't seem to be any

1372.549 --> 1379.6
real structured plans there seem to be

1376.6 --> 1382.27
settings like typical settings of how

1379.6 --> 1384.82
they want things to function the

1382.27 --> 1389.559
direction they want things to have but

1384.82 --> 1391.779
there's no real planner anymore it's

1389.559 --> 1398.71
always a general approach and it seems

1391.779 --> 1401.52
to be all there's no one nobody leading

1398.71 --> 1401.52
really

1407.5 --> 1413.83
and I'm talking about the Democrats in

1409.6 --> 1422.4289999999999
this case by the way so it feels to me

1413.83 --> 1422.4289999999999
almost like this is literal theater

1423.03 --> 1432.039
because the Democrats have basically

1426.07 --> 1439.24
already business-wise decided to fail at

1432.039 --> 1442.83
this time and what they're doing is all

1439.24 --> 1445.63
just fully and keeping the masses busy

1442.83 --> 1449.1299999999999
trying to keep as many people in the

1445.63 --> 1453.3090000000002
spell for as long as they can for

1449.13 --> 1457.15
potential future changing around of the

1453.309 --> 1460.84
situation but for now it seems to be

1457.15 --> 1465.13
very stuck on a railroad with extremely

1460.84 --> 1468.58
little surprises and that gives me the

1465.13 --> 1471.0700000000002
feeling like it was decided like yeah

1468.58 --> 1474.28
you are gonna go down if you're gonna go

1471.07 --> 1476.47
down soft I'll be merciful if you're

1474.28 --> 1484.6789999999999
gonna go down hard then I'll be

1476.47 --> 1484.679
merciless that's what I think

1486.249 --> 1491.929
we'll see how things unroll if at some

1489.44 --> 1497.299
point anything is going to get in the

1491.929 --> 1502.789
way of Trump for real I'd be astounded

1497.299 --> 1507.339
at this point I think there's going to

1502.789 --> 1511.759
be insane amounts of crazy rumors

1507.339 --> 1514.009
probably but that yeah come on

1511.759 --> 1518.169
not like that hasn't been like that in

1514.009 --> 1518.169
the last three years so

1530.19 --> 1538.56
anyway yeah it is political theater at

1532.95 --> 1541.77
least on that level so that that's how I

1538.56 --> 1545.6699999999998
like to see it it's not always theater

1541.77 --> 1548.7
it is sometimes a play the interaction

1545.67 --> 1551.27
becomes like a play and sometimes there

1548.7 --> 1553.56
are deals made and then the play is

1551.27 --> 1560.52
pre-arranged but that's not always the

1553.56 --> 1563.48
case so you've got to figure out what is

1560.52 --> 1567.18
a preset stage where they are literally

1563.48 --> 1572.8700000000001
cooperating players and when is it an

1567.18 --> 1576.3
improvised match and how do you know

1572.87 --> 1582.4799999999998
like a feel it and you can feel it by

1576.3 --> 1587.45
the sudden sudden changes which usually

1582.48 --> 1587.45
tend to be caused by real things

1595.18 --> 1598.0800000000002
hmm

1605.71 --> 1616.21
uh-uh anyway this is not yeah there were

1612.799 --> 1618.799
no debates yesterday I have no idea why

1616.21 --> 1620.839
maybe Nathan thought it was too hot

1618.799 --> 1624.009
maybe you went to a swimming pool with

1620.839 --> 1632.389
his family or something or the beach I

1624.009 --> 1642.739
would if I was him so but other than

1632.389 --> 1645.349
that I haven't done really much yeah red

1642.739 --> 1649.759
pill was live debating a globe and there

1645.349 --> 1655.33
was kind of fresh man the guy is really

1649.759 --> 1658.969
good at completely letting the opponent

1655.33 --> 1661.879
go through and express their entire

1658.969 --> 1666.6190000000001
sentence even though that sentence could

1661.879 --> 1668.6589999999999
be so incredibly outdated and he has

1666.619 --> 1672.4089999999999
some real serious patience there and

1668.659 --> 1674.019
self-control I have to respect that so

1672.409 --> 1676.3090000000002
that was interesting

1674.019 --> 1678.339
Reptil philosophy dude check out his

1676.309 --> 1678.339
channel

1681.82 --> 1694.4399999999998
oh yeah rent ease round Oh God

1688.239 --> 1698.859
oh that was just amazing yeah rent ease

1694.44 --> 1703.659
flat earth a round table aftermath show

1698.859 --> 1706.359
with rumpus well that was just exactly

1703.659 --> 1709.45
what you'd expect it to be although it

1706.359 --> 1712.33
started out pretty now you know what it

1709.45 --> 1714.909
started out pretty meta just talking

1712.33 --> 1720.129
about other people not really in content

1714.909 --> 1722.1090000000002
but after a while rumpus went back into

1720.129 --> 1724.7389999999998
his old track and it just became

1722.109 --> 1724.739
malarious

1740.11 --> 1744.779
what are you talking about henry

1742.059 --> 1744.779
cavendish

1748.94 --> 1753.8600000000001
clinging on an opinion what are you

1752.879 --> 1756.6899999999998
talking about

1753.86 --> 1762.33
you mean entertaining people that are

1756.69 --> 1764.8790000000001
obviously delusional yeah I have little

1762.33 --> 1768.36
patience with that and it's not that I

1764.879 --> 1771.149
don't like to entertain illusion because

1768.36 --> 1773.6999999999998
I find it very amusing it's just the

1771.149 --> 1776.1899999999998
attitude that comes with it and the

1773.7 --> 1783.269
religious conviction that is the part

1776.19 --> 1785.789
that where my spirit is tested because I

1783.269 --> 1790.22
just feel like that shouldn't be

1785.789 --> 1790.22
accepted it should be corrected that's

1790.999 --> 1797.669
so hey if Randy wants to just be like oh

1794.97 --> 1799.6490000000001
yeah you can be all liberal and oh you

1797.669 --> 1803.519
can say whatever you want hey if he

1799.649 --> 1805.4089999999999
wants to do that it's his show he's the

1803.519 --> 1808.86
one to do that if he wants to do that

1805.409 --> 1812.5490000000002
then he can do that I don't really want

1808.86 --> 1817.7589999999998
to do that like that you know I'll try

1812.549 --> 1821.759
to have sensible conversations or

1817.759 --> 1823.999
discussion potentially debate about some

1821.759 --> 1827.159
subjects doesn't even have to be a

1823.999 --> 1833.07
concerning the shape of the world or the

1827.159 --> 1839.97
realm but I'm not gonna suck up to

1833.07 --> 1842.549
ballers and yeah watch them play with

1839.97 --> 1844.499
their fantasy Legos and being all smug

1842.549 --> 1848.46
about it I just can't handle that [ __ ]

1844.499 --> 1851.009
anymore at least I can with some people

1848.46 --> 1855.809
that are fresh that are not aware of

1851.009 --> 1858.84
that but yeah these players rompers

1855.809 --> 1861.32
brand you know they've been doing that

1858.84 --> 1861.32
for so long

1863.82 --> 1871.08
and it just feels like I'm spending my

1867.269 --> 1874.249
time babysitting any cat people and it

1871.08 --> 1874.249
just gets really old

1885.32 --> 1889.6899999999998
rage win why

1893.83 --> 1899.1899999999998
yeah red pill did destroy the dude

1895.95 --> 1899.19
absolutely did

1912.7 --> 1921.3690000000001
I've only praise for red pill philosophy

1915.46 --> 1922.989
I hope you didn't mistake my analysis or

1921.369 --> 1926.499
whatever has some kind of criticism

1922.989 --> 1928.8400000000001
because he did great no I actually was

1926.499 --> 1934.509
very impressed by the way he was able to

1928.84 --> 1936.4599999999998
handle such a stupid thing so

1934.509 --> 1938.1390000000001
elaborately without the need to

1936.46 --> 1941.009
interrupted that that's impressive

1938.139 --> 1941.0089999999998
discipline

1954.0 --> 1970.11
and gradient chart on Nathan show Wow

1962.01 --> 1972.6299999999999
I don't know what I think last there was

1970.11 --> 1979.37
I was on a show where that was discussed

1972.63 --> 1984.24
I think wasn't on debates probably and I

1979.37 --> 1986.2199999999998
don't know what is there there's some

1984.24 --> 1987.29
conclude there's some ways to approach

1986.22 --> 1991.71
it

1987.29 --> 1994.94
but it could be a lot of things or well

1991.71 --> 1998.6100000000001
it could be a few things at least and

1994.94 --> 2003.46
it's more of unknown factors just like

1998.61 --> 2003.4599999999998
all the others you know that's it to me

2048.78 --> 2051.3790000000004
yeah

2054.129 --> 2061.419
Wow that that's hilarious I am mr. panda

2058.389 --> 2067.7490000000003
bear that's an interesting question

2061.419 --> 2072.8489999999997
at least islands in like the Galapagos

2067.749 --> 2076.509
have allegedly well said moved according

2072.849 --> 2078.489
to National Geographic ooh same National

2076.509 --> 2083.049
Geographic that shows ancient aliens

2078.489 --> 2090.849
right I think it was about 30 miles in

2083.049 --> 2094.839
about 40 years does that mean the earth

2090.849 --> 2098.589
does move no no doesn't what it means is

2094.839 --> 2101.13
that parts of the surface in relation to

2098.589 --> 2103.869
other parts of the surface moves

2101.13 --> 2107.079
apparently so

2103.869 --> 2109.869
the surface in relation to other parts

2107.079 --> 2114.279
of surface does seem to move and

2109.869 --> 2117.309
maneuver and do things but that that's

2114.279 --> 2120.299
not the whole that doesn't make the

2117.309 --> 2120.299
whole moving

2166.819 --> 2173.029
well I am mr. panda bear look a

2170.14 --> 2174.979
countenance floating on what although to

2173.029 --> 2178.939
say continents would be a mistake

2174.979 --> 2181.7889999999998
because I'm pretty sure they're now just

2178.939 --> 2184.3089999999997
saying tectonic plates and they have a

2181.789 --> 2187.1890000000003
supposed explanation as to what is going

2184.309 --> 2192.559
on with the tectonic plates but at least

2187.189 --> 2196.999
there is data that points out that there

2192.559 --> 2198.4990000000003
is some kind of movement of or what you

2196.999 --> 2202.459
can't consider plates

2198.499 --> 2207.589
however they presume they work plates

2202.459 --> 2213.89
and they move and cause pressure cause

2207.589 --> 2219.41
voids all that that is happening so what

2213.89 --> 2223.999
is that sitting on is it just more earth

2219.41 --> 2227.479
beneath there or does the friction

2223.999 --> 2234.529
process of the push cause I don't know

2227.479 --> 2237.049
things to liquefy into magma or I know

2234.529 --> 2240.039
it's too hard for me to try to think

2237.049 --> 2240.0389999999998
about that right house

2261.19 --> 2264.389
[Music]

2283.4 --> 2287.1800000000003
alright by the way for those who don't

2285.619 --> 2288.92
know yet

2287.18 --> 2291.019
tomorrow there's not gonna be an early

2288.92 --> 2294.109
bird show because tomorrow in the

2291.019 --> 2300.41
morning very early I'm gonna go over to

2294.109 --> 2302.119
a friend of mine over in MA and yeah I'm

2300.41 --> 2305.41
not gonna have time for an early bird

2302.119 --> 2306.98
show so you're gonna have to miss me

2305.41 --> 2311.799
this Saturday

2306.98 --> 2311.799
but I will be back of course Sunday so

2315.95 --> 2321.319
we're gonna have to find some other way

2318.2 --> 2324.9199999999996
to spend your time tomorrow morning or

2321.319 --> 2327.25
afternoon or however whatever time it is

2324.92 --> 2327.25
for you

2331.66 --> 2334.66
okay

2383.24 --> 2397.1299999999997
yeah sorry guys I am just so hot here

2387.18 --> 2397.1299999999997
dad you probably see it that's just yeah

2399.89 --> 2401.92
I

2418.85 --> 2423.68
I haven't done too much media-wise

2421.61 --> 2427.31
yesterday because because of the heat

2423.68 --> 2432.2599999999998
and probably not gonna do too much today

2427.31 --> 2434.87
either so right

2432.26 --> 2440.38
is there a debates today or is in there

2434.87 --> 2440.38
I don't see it probably not

2460.94 --> 2470.5
I have no idea leoch I haven't seen her

2467.75 --> 2470.5
in chat today

2508.48 --> 2514.2
oh she did did she look good on her

2518.46 --> 2523.9
maybe she figured out it was finally

2521.23 --> 2525.79
time to stop troll baiting because she

2523.9 --> 2534.4900000000002
did kind of have a problem with that and

2525.79 --> 2537.0299999999997
I think she realized that as well so

2534.49 --> 2537.0299999999997
good on her

2542.839 --> 2550.4
I hope she still comes by on my on my

2546.679 --> 2556.9
show though because I do appreciate when

2550.4 --> 2556.9
she's in my chat okay

2568.78 --> 2573.9700000000003
nice one matheus the walking witness

2587.19 --> 2594.81
oh all that talk about showers this

2593.04 --> 2597.15
isn't making me feel like I'm probably

2594.81 --> 2602.46
gonna take it a cold shower right after

2597.15 --> 2609.15
this because it's it's just maximum heat

2602.46 --> 2611.25
right now it's almost 3 o'clock that's

2609.15 --> 2616.4100000000003
when most of the heat has pretty much

2611.25 --> 2619.05
been collected the air outside is now

2616.41 --> 2624.42
the hottest and you see stuff floating

2619.05 --> 2630.6800000000003
you see if like Fluffy's floating around

2624.42 --> 2630.6800000000003
everywhere it's hot

2631.97 --> 2634.6299999999997
so

2640.26 --> 2651.7900000000004
yeah so yeah sorry for not really

2646.57 --> 2654.76
helping with the Haiti issue but for in

2651.79 --> 2657.19
order for that to do for me to do that I

2654.76 --> 2660.1600000000003
have to kind of help my own heat issue

2657.19 --> 2661.38
here first and that's not gonna happen

2660.16 --> 2669.16
anytime soon

2661.38 --> 2679.0
but at least I'll keep up the right

2669.16 --> 2682.6299999999997
vitamins and plenty of drinks and I'll

2679.0 --> 2685.99
survive until everything can cool down a

2682.63 --> 2692.02
bit I can start to really use my brain

2685.99 --> 2694.6499999999996
again or my mind and brain is just a

2692.02 --> 2694.65
registry

2694.96 --> 2698.19
[Music]

2723.13 --> 2725.79
hmm

2729.71 --> 2736.27
I've recognized Stefan he'll derson I

2737.049 --> 2747.25
haven't really seen any I don't think so

2742.299 --> 2750.74
but there's still a couple of stripes

2747.25 --> 2753.319
hanging around what seemed to have been

2750.74 --> 2757.7
chemtrails so they probably did do some

2753.319 --> 2762.049
of it but not as much as I've seen two

2757.7 --> 2766.779
days ago for example Daniel you're

2762.049 --> 2766.779
cooking as well yep

2817.7 --> 2832.72
little bit more aggressive I don't have

2829.76 --> 2839.26
a flight Raider app because I don't have
