99.84 --> 104.04
I was almost like not gonna do a show

101.7 --> 106.259
today because it was just late and had a

104.04 --> 107.4
late night and Nathan's not doing a show

106.259 --> 108.659
and

107.4 --> 110.88000000000001
but

108.659 --> 114.54
yeah

110.88 --> 117.06
so I just started the show an hour late

114.54 --> 118.5
we'll see what happens

117.06 --> 122.119
right

118.5 --> 122.119
whether today is

123.54 --> 128.03900000000002
yeah not as blue sky as it was yesterday

126.119 --> 131.94
in the days before

128.039 --> 135.26
it's a bit more grayish soup

131.94 --> 137.52
there is signs of trails

135.26 --> 138.959
but I don't know if they're the direct

137.52 --> 141.9
cause of this

138.959 --> 145.739
kind of hazy sky

141.9 --> 149.48000000000002
it looks quite uniform so

145.739 --> 149.48000000000002
yeah not so much sun

150.12 --> 156.08
it's not really cold though but it's not

153.12 --> 156.08
exactly warm either

158.4 --> 163.34
I guess today would make for like a good

160.62 --> 163.34
working day

163.77 --> 166.869
[Music]

171.3 --> 178.62
hello psych bear first in chat BJC net

175.26 --> 179.94
slow-mo moon buggy Terry 306 good to see

178.62 --> 185.54
you all

179.94 --> 185.54
it is Monday the 3rd of October 2022

186.84 --> 190.879
oh lva Paul good to see you

196.26 --> 207.92999999999998
[Music]

221.459 --> 226.34
right so

223.2 --> 226.33999999999997
hey steamy Traveler

240.319 --> 245.45899999999997
right so yesterday was

243.42 --> 248.099
I don't know the guys were really chatty

245.459 --> 249.84
again so it was just another

248.099 --> 252.92
call

249.84 --> 252.92000000000002
in Skype

258.18 --> 262.56
so yeah I mean I think the guys are

261.18 --> 265.94
going to be frustrated today that

262.56 --> 265.94
there's no life letters debate

266.16 --> 270.74
but I don't know I'm thinking maybe I

268.38 --> 270.74
could like

271.139 --> 275.24
open the Gilded panel or something

280.979 --> 287.4
at some point and moving the guys and

284.639 --> 289.699
just have them talk a lot I mean they're

287.4 --> 292.02
gonna want to talk right

289.699 --> 294.44
it's what they do at the Flat Earth

292.02 --> 294.44
debates

okay

313.35 --> 316.53900000000004
[Music]

338.4 --> 341.12
all right

343.38 --> 347.28
right yeah Tara it's not necessarily

345.3 --> 349.44
going to be a short show

347.28 --> 351.479
I'm just starting an hour late there's

349.44 --> 353.84
not going to be a live letter debates

351.479 --> 353.84
today

361.18 --> 364.389

367.28 --> 371.32

374.53 --> 381.02
[Music]

383.479 --> 388.74
foreign

386.0 --> 391.94
I don't know

388.74 --> 391.94
I don't think so

392.1 --> 398.03900000000004
maybe Nathan's just worked like all

395.28 --> 399.9
weekend or something to get things right

398.039 --> 401.52
I think he's been working on this sound

399.9 --> 405.5
system

401.52 --> 405.5
and he just needed a day off

406.199 --> 410.16
that could be it too

408.419 --> 413.94
it's not it wouldn't be the first time

410.16 --> 415.86
that happened so but yeah I didn't say

413.94 --> 418.4
because of technical issues or anything

415.86 --> 418.40000000000003
so

420.539 --> 428.71999999999997
what motor Nathan has I don't think he

424.319 --> 428.72
uses a monitor I think he uses a beamer

430.02 --> 436.81899999999996
unlike a wall

432.66 --> 436.819
or yeah a projector

437.19 --> 442.279
[Music]

452.759 --> 455.759
foreign

462.0 --> 467.34
so my head is filled up with something

464.52 --> 469.79999999999995
that's very unusual

467.34 --> 472.73999999999995
to me

469.8 --> 475.16
I was watching Netflix yesterday that

472.74 --> 479.699
was just this weird

475.16 --> 484.38000000000005
documentary miniseries about Finance

479.699 --> 488.66
about the uh GameStop

484.38 --> 491.88
thing that apparently happened in 2021

488.66 --> 493.86
vaguely remember about it but those

491.88 --> 495.419
things tend to like completely Pass Me

493.86 --> 499.16
By

495.419 --> 499.15999999999997
but yeah watching that

501.66 --> 507.53900000000004
and there's just so much spiritual

505.02 --> 509.52
metadata it's crazy

507.539 --> 512.36
so I'm kind of still in the middle of

509.52 --> 512.36
processing that

512.58 --> 517.5
because yeah this financial world and

515.64 --> 519.419
how it works and it's like I'm thinking

517.5 --> 521.82
like could I do that what would be the

519.419 --> 523.14
consequences what am I doing now

521.82 --> 526.2600000000001
what

523.14 --> 527.1
that I do now would be disrupted if I do

526.26 --> 531.56
that

527.1 --> 531.5600000000001
and yeah I did absolutely fine things

536.94 --> 542.6400000000001
right

539.459 --> 544.5
but yeah that's kind of fresh on my mind

542.64 --> 547.459
pretty much was watching that right

544.5 --> 547.459
before going to bed

555.14 --> 562.459
here a Miss type

558.48 --> 568.5600000000001
and yeah Eat the Rich the game stuff

562.459 --> 573.5999999999999
oh great I specifically clicked mute

568.56 --> 577.1999999999999
and then it unmuted it didn't just

573.6 --> 581.1
not stay muted it unmuted

577.2 --> 584.94
because I hovered over and it said muted

581.1 --> 587.58
and then suddenly clicked on the site

584.94 --> 590.58
and then it wasn't muted oh yes

587.58 --> 590.58
consistency

591.0 --> 594.32
uh anyway

601.74 --> 606.6
to the rich

603.48 --> 610.6800000000001
it's like it's all but it's all Jews

606.6 --> 613.98
it's all of it the entire thing like

610.68 --> 616.019
very distinctly

613.98 --> 620.1800000000001
I didn't have to mention the word even

616.019 --> 620.18
once it was just blatantly obvious

628.91 --> 634.1999999999999
[Music]

631.1 --> 638.0
but it was kind of interesting because

634.2 --> 641.1
they did give a bit of a stable I think

638.0 --> 643.08
stable enough look into like how they

641.1 --> 646.4200000000001
look at things so it was also a bit

643.08 --> 648.9590000000001
about ordinance culture

646.42 --> 653.12
[Music]

648.959 --> 653.1199999999999
but God some of these people just

654.959 --> 660.959
spent so much of their intelligence of

657.839 --> 663.839
on on just having oversight over

660.959 --> 666.2399999999999
everything involved I mean they don't

663.839 --> 668.4590000000001
just invest they literally just learn

666.24 --> 670.92
everything by heart and [ __ ] it's crazy

668.459 --> 673.92
I mean I could never do that I

670.92 --> 677.04
absolutely do not have the

673.92 --> 678.779
the patience to ever do something like

677.04 --> 680.0999999999999
that

678.779 --> 683.04
like

680.1 --> 684.8000000000001
on a whim or like quickly just as an

683.04 --> 686.2199999999999
investment or something

684.8 --> 688.5
[Music]

686.22 --> 690.839
I mean I'd have to be pretty passionate

688.5 --> 692.59
about something to ever even do any

690.839 --> 694.9200000000001
elaborate research

692.59 --> 697.5600000000001
[Music]

694.92 --> 700.64
but yeah anyway they were in a way it

697.56 --> 700.64
was kind of like a game

703.019 --> 708.14
yeah criminal that Robin Hood disable

705.6 --> 708.14
the button

708.24 --> 716.42
yeah I got to that part yeah

713.399 --> 716.42
pretty bizarre

716.459 --> 720.7399999999999
I mean that is just blatant rigging

725.48 --> 730.38
now I wonder like

728.04 --> 732.18
not that I know I mean I haven't like

730.38 --> 734.16
completely finished the whole series I

732.18 --> 736.6999999999999
still have to like watch half of the

734.16 --> 736.6999999999999
last part

737.64 --> 741.66
but I don't even know like what's that

739.92 --> 744.36
even

741.66 --> 746.16
legal of them to do that did they ever

744.36 --> 747.899
really get into trouble for that I don't

746.16 --> 750.18
remember they might have

747.899 --> 752.12
I mean I do remember like the word Robin

750.18 --> 755.88
Hood

752.12 --> 758.22
2021 through news and all that

755.88 --> 761.42
it's just I'm never really interested in

758.22 --> 761.4200000000001
finance I just

761.519 --> 765.5
yeah for obvious reasons

765.75 --> 769.029
[Music]

769.139 --> 771.32
foreign

779.7 --> 790.22
[Music]

792.48 --> 796.339
oh

794.04 --> 796.3389999999999
right

802.139 --> 806.82
but they'll come soon enough I mean

804.839 --> 810.3000000000001
especially as soon as they figure out

806.82 --> 813.139
that the Flat Earth debates not live

810.3 --> 813.139
so

818.55 --> 821.67
[Music]

825.57 --> 830.7600000000001
[Music]

828.3 --> 832.2199999999999
hey dang ah there uh there you go

830.76 --> 835.98
tominoid

832.22 --> 838.32
no live show today well no live show on

835.98 --> 840.5600000000001
the FED I mean there's a live show right

838.32 --> 840.5600000000001
here

841.44 --> 847.7600000000001
and I think I'm uh trying out a open

844.139 --> 847.76
Panel with gilded for a bit

847.86 --> 852.6800000000001
OVA pull already linked through

857.96 --> 861.08
[Music]

878.279 --> 881.54
what is this

886.17 --> 891.42
[Music]

888.12 --> 895.279
all right I'm in there

891.42 --> 895.279
just gonna put it on deafen

895.56 --> 900.9499999999999
we'll see if somebody shows up

897.77 --> 900.9499999999999
[Music]

903.899 --> 906.38
all right

910.86 --> 914.36
the animatronic

915.21 --> 920.1
[Music]

917.519 --> 921.779
well even if I was an animatronic it

920.1 --> 924.44
would still be a live show because it's

921.779 --> 924.4399999999999
a live stream

925.38 --> 930.18
hilarious though

927.14 --> 932.9399999999999
[Music]

930.18 --> 934.079
no Nathan is not having PC issues I

932.94 --> 937.1400000000001
think

934.079 --> 940.3499999999999
you didn't say so at least

937.14 --> 940.35
[Music]

946.38 --> 952.5
now hey Jeff gashead wonder what

950.399 --> 954.899
what would happen if we ignored the

952.5 --> 957.36
trolls completely or they'll just find

954.899 --> 959.54
new ways to be trolls that's what

957.36 --> 959.54
happens

962.98 --> 973.58
[Music]

976.62 --> 979.16
foreign

991.44 --> 997.98
yeah no passive cooling systems

996.0 --> 1000.44
I mean I have

997.98 --> 1003.32
pretty basic passive cooling radiator

1000.44 --> 1006.139
but

1003.32 --> 1009.62
like heat distribution and

1006.139 --> 1014.36
like especially for heavier computers

1009.62 --> 1016.339
that's all pretty sophisticated design

1014.36 --> 1018.94
I mean

1016.339 --> 1018.94
yeah

1018.99 --> 1022.21
[Music]

1023.72 --> 1029.48
I be they have to basically like create

1025.939 --> 1031.699
a heat for a long for the Heat

1029.48 --> 1036.38
that's very much what it's like so it's

1031.699 --> 1040.1000000000001
like as much surface as possible

1036.38 --> 1042.8190000000002
to radiate that heat towards

1040.1 --> 1042.819
so

1043.64 --> 1049.76
and I think also part of it is that

1047.12 --> 1051.02
you had then have like just a really

1049.76 --> 1054.74
silent

1051.02 --> 1057.98
super slow fan right next to it that you

1054.74 --> 1060.26
just want here and it blows very slowly

1057.98 --> 1061.7
but because of the sheer surface of the

1060.26 --> 1063.62
radiator

1061.7 --> 1065.419
that will still

1063.62 --> 1067.7099999999998
then

1065.419 --> 1069.0200000000002
yeah cool it off

1067.71 --> 1072.02
[Music]

1069.02 --> 1073.6399999999999
that's kind of the setup that I had

1072.02 --> 1077.029
right anyway

1073.64 --> 1077.029
[Music]

1091.52 --> 1096.02
oh wait I have my own group huh

1105.559 --> 1109.8999999999999

1273.4 --> 1278.7800000000002
I mean I think my computer is very

1276.38 --> 1280.7600000000002
decent it's not like oh you got the

1278.78 --> 1284.059
latest stuff and you can have three

1280.76 --> 1286.82
monitors and blah blah

1284.059 --> 1288.86
but it's really effective

1286.82 --> 1291.039
I mean it runs everything that I want to

1288.86 --> 1291.039
run

1296.84 --> 1301.1589999999999
all right it's only when you want to get

1298.76 --> 1303.98
excessive if you want like the extra

1301.159 --> 1306.38
special Graphics or whatever yeah then

1303.98 --> 1307.52
you're screwed you're always going to be

1306.38 --> 1309.46
screwed

1307.52 --> 1312.679
it's going to be a lot of electricity

1309.46 --> 1316.24
and a lot of noise or just insane

1312.679 --> 1316.24
amounts of money and endless trouble

1316.94 --> 1321.74
so

1318.799 --> 1324.49
I like to keep my computer simple and my

1321.74 --> 1335.02
video games old

1394.33 --> 1412.78
[Music]

1410.24 --> 1412.78
but

1417.62 --> 1420.52
tons

1424.22 --> 1430.7
and for stable diffusion what

1427.64 --> 1433.8200000000002
air oh okay

1430.7 --> 1436.5800000000002
is that the one that I brought up

1433.82 --> 1439.3999999999999
that I got I said one of those like

1436.58 --> 1442.1589999999999
visualizers

1439.4 --> 1445.6000000000001
initializing engines I had a segment

1442.159 --> 1448.46
about that like a month ago

1445.6 --> 1450.799
through mind and failed who did a whole

1448.46 --> 1454.0
video about it

1450.799 --> 1454.0
is that what you're talking about

1457.82 --> 1461.08
text image right

1466.64 --> 1470.44
hey Susie s good to see you

1476.23 --> 1479.67
[Music]

1496.36 --> 1501.9799999999998
watching the awareness of the Flat Earth

1498.86 --> 1505.76
growing into normal YouTube sides right

1501.98 --> 1507.98
it's become discussable

1505.76 --> 1510.799
right but this has been ongoing for a

1507.98 --> 1513.919
long time though Jeff gassad I mean

1510.799 --> 1516.1399999999999
you're in it now so you're getting used

1513.919 --> 1519.2
to getting used to it but

1516.14 --> 1521.0590000000002
like for example seven years ago 10

1519.2 --> 1524.9
years ago

1521.059 --> 1527.6
like there was such overreaction like

1524.9 --> 1530.299
the overreaction was so heavy that

1527.6 --> 1533.059
people would literally be afraid get

1530.299 --> 1536.679
like anxious when it was brought up

1533.059 --> 1536.6789999999999
like this shut up

1537.679 --> 1540.98
like that's crazy We're not gonna talk

1539.6 --> 1543.82
about that

1540.98 --> 1543.82
and

1544.72 --> 1548.26
for some reason

1548.84 --> 1554.059
even in like a mainstream thinking there

1551.9 --> 1556.88
has been a Consciousness forming of that

1554.059 --> 1559.82
there is just flat earthers

1556.88 --> 1561.98
that they exist and you can either look

1559.82 --> 1564.5
at it they'll either look at it as like

1561.98 --> 1568.1
oh it's just this weirdo cult that just

1564.5 --> 1569.6
has to go against it it just have to go

1568.1 --> 1571.6999999999998
against the ball

1569.6 --> 1575.779
not because it isn't a ball but because

1571.7 --> 1577.88
they just had to go against the thing

1575.779 --> 1579.26
that if we all know they're just being

1577.88 --> 1580.46
rebellious

1579.26 --> 1582.919
right

1580.46 --> 1583.7
plenty of excuses but the thing is is

1582.919 --> 1586.279
that

1583.7 --> 1588.5
there is just general awareness that

1586.279 --> 1589.46
there is a whole bunch of people out

1588.5 --> 1591.919
there

1589.46 --> 1594.559
that are really

1591.919 --> 1596.179
like not as a joke

1594.559 --> 1601.1789999999999
thinking that the Earth is flat and

1596.179 --> 1601.179
arguing that and debating it endlessly

1602.179 --> 1607.22
that's become normalized people are

1605.12 --> 1609.02
figuring out that that is a thing like

1607.22 --> 1610.84
there's flat earthers out there just

1609.02 --> 1614.3799999999999
like

1610.84 --> 1614.3799999999999
other groups

1619.34 --> 1624.9189999999999
I think really like with all the new

1622.22 --> 1627.32
weirdo friends that are getting bigger

1624.919 --> 1629.48
subcultures that are popping up

1627.32 --> 1632.6
and even likes from within the old left

1629.48 --> 1634.88
movement and all that

1632.6 --> 1637.279
I think that flat earthers are really

1634.88 --> 1639.14
the most

1637.279 --> 1641.98
benign

1639.14 --> 1641.98
of them all

1642.62 --> 1649.039
and I think that people subconsciously

1645.74 --> 1651.26
are even figuring that out

1649.039 --> 1652.94
like yeah there's all these cultures out

1651.26 --> 1655.1
there they're all like oh we're gonna

1652.94 --> 1657.8600000000001
win and they're getting aggressive and

1655.1 --> 1661.2199999999998
lying and disgusting and they're all

1657.86 --> 1664.4599999999998
gradually sliding down that this gross

1661.22 --> 1668.419
slippery shitty slope of gay

1664.46 --> 1671.5
and well flat earthers typically don't

1668.419 --> 1671.5
do any of that

1673.1 --> 1679.8799999999999
and people will feel that

1677.779 --> 1682.88
and instead of being like oh they're so

1679.88 --> 1684.74
crazy at first they'll be like wow you

1682.88 --> 1687.0200000000002
know they're so

1684.74 --> 1689.48
I mean I think they're wrong the Earth

1687.02 --> 1693.22
has to be a glow but at least they're

1689.48 --> 1696.919
like as human beings they seem like very

1693.22 --> 1699.02
attentative and perceptive and

1696.919 --> 1702.14
they know a lot about

1699.02 --> 1704.12
crazy mind control things in the world

1702.14 --> 1707.539
on average

1704.12 --> 1710.6
right people could see that

1707.539 --> 1712.279
so it's it's just starting to trickle in

1710.6 --> 1713.84
like there's an awareness like oh

1712.279 --> 1715.58
there's Flat Earth there's just like oh

1713.84 --> 1718.58
there is

1715.58 --> 1718.58
Christians

1718.76 --> 1723.799
or Jews

1721.34 --> 1725.539
like that's a thing a pretty big thing

1723.799 --> 1730.12
and people are like oh yeah flat

1725.539 --> 1730.12
earthers okay that's the thing now

1731.6 --> 1737.4189999999999
oh that's a huge huge massive difference

1734.419 --> 1739.46
from seven years ago

1737.419 --> 1742.4
that was not there

1739.46 --> 1743.659
people were hyper nervous if it was

1742.4 --> 1745.8300000000002
brought up

1743.659 --> 1748.8200000000002
some of them

1745.83 --> 1751.6999999999998
[Music]

1748.82 --> 1753.9189999999999
now it's a thing that people even people

1751.7 --> 1755.48
that aren't necessarily smart can just

1753.919 --> 1757.76
talk about

1755.48 --> 1759.799
like it's something that you can just

1757.76 --> 1762.32
slip in the conversation like oh I

1759.799 --> 1764.779
bumped into this Flat Earth or something

1762.32 --> 1766.6399999999999
and it doesn't have to ruin everybody's

1764.779 --> 1768.26
day if it's brought up that's the

1766.64 --> 1770.72
difference

1768.26 --> 1773.059
except for with anti-flat Earth they

1770.72 --> 1775.279
will still have their day ruined if

1773.059 --> 1777.02
somebody in the real life in the

1775.279 --> 1778.94
physical world around them actually

1777.02 --> 1781.279
brings it up

1778.94 --> 1783.3200000000002
it will ruin their day but yeah that's

1781.279 --> 1785.62
what you get when you become a anti-flat

1783.32 --> 1785.62
earther

1785.72 --> 1788.38
huh

1791.0 --> 1796.84
if I'm trying to find a curve elevation

1794.36 --> 1796.84
angle

1797.899 --> 1802.9599999999998
now it's an elevation angle to a curved

1800.36 --> 1802.9599999999998
Baseline

1805.279 --> 1810.76
but I I understood that that's what you

1807.5 --> 1810.76
meant uh

1819.799 --> 1824.3799999999999
oh okay PG seen it

1824.419 --> 1828.14
fortunately have to go out with my well

1826.88 --> 1831.2

1828.14 --> 1832.88

1960.22 --> 1964.22
hitting the bank

1962.24 --> 1967.58
afterwards

1964.22 --> 1970.76

1970.76 --> 1975.64

how does that work

1977.779 --> 1982.58
do you like get

1979.82 --> 1984.4399999999998
do you get all your business in cash

1982.58 --> 1986.6
so you have to like

1984.44 --> 1989.799
put it on the bank in order to transfer

1986.6 --> 1989.799
it is that what you mean

1991.58 --> 1994.0
oh

1995.0 --> 2001.6
bought the book of the sun okay

1999.019 --> 2005.58
yeah he did he did write that book is it

2001.6 --> 2005.58
any good I've never seen it

2005.799 --> 2013.6589999999999
is it actually any good or is it just

2008.32 --> 2013.6589999999999
really like old 2015 material

2015.46 --> 2019.299
I need to cash a check oh okay okay

2017.74 --> 2022.48
right

2019.299 --> 2024.039
you miss Antonio sad loss

2022.48 --> 2027.94
yeah

2024.039 --> 2030.94
to be fair I mean he was also a real

2027.94 --> 2034.24
gamut backstabbing [ __ ]

2030.94 --> 2036.22
he had pretty Advanced savonia complex

2034.24 --> 2039.46
but still

2036.22 --> 2043.299
in between that he was

2039.46 --> 2046.48
a very interesting man

2043.299 --> 2049.54
he had ways like he had a bit of like

2046.48 --> 2052.119
magic a bit of fairy magic

2049.54 --> 2055.3
it was just I I thought he was very

2052.119 --> 2058.659
inspirational like even even after the

2055.3 --> 2061.54
whole stupid Patricia stair Fiasco

2058.659 --> 2063.879
nonsense that he rolled out

2061.54 --> 2068.339
I mean that was like a real bummer to me

2063.879 --> 2068.339
I really like like the guy before that

2068.56 --> 2071.7
I thought he was my friend

2072.23 --> 2079.98
[Music]

2077.32 --> 2079.98
but

2080.619 --> 2084.639
I mean it would have been more

2082.839 --> 2086.679
interesting if he had still been around

2084.639 --> 2089.5
for sure

2086.679 --> 2091.179
unless he would have like gone all ranty

2089.5 --> 2093.7
and [ __ ] but I

2091.179 --> 2095.56
yeah you never know he's he's not there

2093.7 --> 2097.24
anymore so you don't know if he would

2095.56 --> 2100.75
have done that or not

2097.24 --> 2105.0099999999998
he might have he might have not

2100.75 --> 2105.01
[Music]

2117.339 --> 2121.66
right and one of the things that I

2119.14 --> 2124.5989999999997
really did like about him is that he did

2121.66 --> 2125.68
like very careful analysis of other

2124.599 --> 2128.8
people

2125.68 --> 2131.0789999999997
and not just to mock them

2128.8 --> 2134.579
and that's what I really appreciate this

2131.079 --> 2134.579
is one of the things that I do too

2137.64 --> 2142.44
Tricia's claims that extend

2143.079 --> 2146.82
bye what

2149.92 --> 2153.7200000000003
I don't even remember what it is I just

2152.44 --> 2156.339
know that

2153.72 --> 2158.3199999999997
Antonio's started blabbering and

2156.339 --> 2160.72
spreading rumors that she was a

2158.32 --> 2164.7000000000003
transsexual even though he literally had

2160.72 --> 2164.7
like sex with her for like half a year

2166.74 --> 2174.5989999999997
and that was really the main issue I

2170.02 --> 2174.599
think she may have like tried to

2175.0 --> 2179.74
sue for rape or something I don't know I

2178.06 --> 2182.68
don't really care

2179.74 --> 2186.4799999999996
it got really it got like a nasty

2182.68 --> 2186.48
divorce type situation and

2191.26 --> 2197.2000000000003
I don't really care

2193.38 --> 2199.42
I just know that like until the end

2197.2 --> 2201.7599999999998
pretty much he persisted with spreading

2199.42 --> 2204.3
really nasty rumors that are totally

2201.76 --> 2204.3
insane

2206.26 --> 2212.0200000000004
I mean saying yeah yeah she's actually a

2210.16 --> 2214.1189999999997
man

2212.02 --> 2217.66
that I've lived with for half a years

2214.119 --> 2221.92
and had sex with on a regular basis

2217.66 --> 2225.7
yes you know in other words hi I'm

2221.92 --> 2228.28
Antonio subarot I'm actually gay are you

2225.7 --> 2230.6189999999997
catching on yet

2228.28 --> 2232.2400000000002
but I don't think he actually was gay I

2230.619 --> 2234.96
think he's just

2232.24 --> 2238.5
was really

2234.96 --> 2238.5
butt hurt over

2238.599 --> 2245.2200000000003
yeah Patricia not

2240.82 --> 2245.2200000000003
basically staying in love with him

2247.72 --> 2252.66
and that's it

2250.18 --> 2255.64
anyway

2255.64 --> 2261.94

2264.04 --> 2267.2799999999997
got that

2265.48 --> 2269.7400000000002
from Antonio

2267.28 --> 2271.48
although piche might have already spread

2269.74 --> 2275.0789999999997
that kind of nonsense even before that

2271.48 --> 2277.54
but he said everybody's a [ __ ] so

2275.079 --> 2279.88
I mean I don't think he believes there's

2277.54 --> 2281.44
actual women out there in the world

2279.88 --> 2284.92
not really

2281.44 --> 2287.76
it's just a ruse that's being upheld

2284.92 --> 2287.76
collectively

2288.28 --> 2295.3
like it's just some men just get like

2293.14 --> 2296.7999999999997
sexual operations to turn them into

2295.3 --> 2299.6800000000003
apparent women

2296.8 --> 2301.8390000000004
that in their youth that's it that's how

2299.68 --> 2303.7599999999998
Humanity actually works there's only one

2301.839 --> 2305.2
sex man

2303.76 --> 2308.4
but

2305.2 --> 2311.3799999999997
I don't know for psychological reasons

2308.4 --> 2313.2400000000002
there's just a percentage of men that at

2311.38 --> 2316.48
Birth are immediately sexually

2313.24 --> 2318.52
surgically transformed into women

2316.48 --> 2320.56
I think that piche actually believes

2318.52 --> 2323.2599999999998
that

2320.56 --> 2325.42
or don't not literally wouldn't say that

2323.26 --> 2329.0200000000004
but that's pretty much the conclusion

2325.42 --> 2332.46
you will derive from

2329.02 --> 2332.46
how he talks about it

2333.16 --> 2339.8199999999997
I think Patricia is a mega hottie yeah

2336.579 --> 2342.42
she's a regular beauty queen

2339.82 --> 2342.42
serious

2342.53 --> 2348.05
[Music]

2355.54 --> 2360.7599999999998
yes I remember when I was on the show

2358.3 --> 2363.04
too I still have it on my channel

2360.76 --> 2365.0400000000004
and there's the videos of course out

2363.04 --> 2368.44
there

2365.04 --> 2371.38
Arwin came on patrol

2368.44 --> 2373.96
those videos you probably some of you

2371.38 --> 2375.94
probably remember that if you are if you

2373.96 --> 2378.04
Google Arwin you'll still bump into them

2375.94 --> 2379.96
I think although some of them I actually

2378.04 --> 2384.96
had taken down

2379.96 --> 2384.96
and Patricia also did because yeah

2388.66 --> 2392.98
but God did they like to poke fun of

2391.06 --> 2396.2999999999997
that

2392.98 --> 2396.3
what a big deal

2399.91 --> 2403.1099999999997
[Music]

2406.119 --> 2411.42
hey is there someone else in here

2408.94 --> 2411.42
huh

2420.16 --> 2425.2799999999997
right

2421.42 --> 2425.28
so what do you guys think if I

2426.52 --> 2431.92
if I open a conversation with lva Paul I

2429.94 --> 2433.7200000000003
mean I barely know anything about this

2431.92 --> 2437.26
guy

2433.72 --> 2440.2799999999997
maybe he wants to actually

2437.26 --> 2440.28
a bit of a talk

2441.46 --> 2446.2200000000003
what do you think

2443.5 --> 2446.22
in chat

2466.48 --> 2471.119
all right

2467.74 --> 2471.1189999999997
hey Paul you there

2474.94 --> 2477.359
hello

2483.579 --> 2488.98
can you hear me ah yeah

2486.88 --> 2493.2000000000003
who is the the other

2488.98 --> 2493.2
really is level oh

2494.8 --> 2502.0600000000004
that's my shock account oh oh all right

2499.54 --> 2504.16
all right I just wanted to check the new

2502.06 --> 2506.38
role I created works because anyone with

2504.16 --> 2509.2
the Armenian role gets to see this group

2506.38 --> 2513.1600000000003
so they can join

2509.2 --> 2514.4199999999996
anyone with the arwenian role

2513.16 --> 2518.04
really

2514.42 --> 2518.04
what what is that

2519.28 --> 2523.619
just just the role so they can see this

2521.38 --> 2523.619
group

2524.26 --> 2528.46
how do you change it if you want if you

2526.42 --> 2531.52
don't like it I don't know how that

2528.46 --> 2535.32
works I mean I wasn't even all that

2531.52 --> 2535.32
familiar with Discord but

2535.54 --> 2540.16
well basically you can make separate

2537.82 --> 2541.96
categories and separate groups so you've

2540.16 --> 2543.64
got your own tile we can see with your

2541.96 --> 2546.04
tree and Avatar

2543.64 --> 2548.3799999999997
and you can make roles so people can see

2546.04 --> 2550.599
certain groups but they're not others so

2548.38 --> 2553.3
you can have like a mod group

2550.599 --> 2554.6800000000003
which we have on fed and you can just

2553.3 --> 2557.5600000000004
restrict people from seeing certain

2554.68 --> 2559.72
things it's a bit too complicated really

2557.56 --> 2560.74
it's more complicated than it needs to

2559.72 --> 2564.3999999999996
be

2560.74 --> 2566.4399999999996
okay so it's really like a yeah a

2564.4 --> 2569.02
moderator thing

2566.44 --> 2570.64
so that they they build it that you can

2569.02 --> 2574.599
basically

2570.64 --> 2576.7599999999998
need a very unique special invite right

2574.599 --> 2579.52
somebody's going to be like oh oh we

2576.76 --> 2582.579
like him to know that we exist so we're

2579.52 --> 2583.839
gonna Mark him to be able to see this

2582.579 --> 2586.619
group

2583.839 --> 2586.619
is it like that

2591.46 --> 2597.119
that that's handy

2594.94 --> 2599.5
especially

2597.119 --> 2602.819
they've had like people like Brenda

2599.5 --> 2602.819
trying to join several times

2603.7 --> 2608.6189999999997
because I have a voice verify situation

2606.4 --> 2610.06
where only newcomers can speak in one

2608.619 --> 2613.3
room and they can't do anything else

2610.06 --> 2615.339
until someone like me or QE comes along

2613.3 --> 2617.5
and gives them perms

2615.339 --> 2620.14
right

2617.5 --> 2622.119
yeah no that that's a good system

2620.14 --> 2625.0
I mean it's very sensible you don't want

2622.119 --> 2626.78
anybody to just suddenly jump into a

2625.0 --> 2627.94
life situation

2626.78 --> 2630.2200000000003
[Music]

2627.94 --> 2631.7200000000003
you hear that that guy that joined

2630.22 --> 2634.06
Nathan's the other week and he was

2631.72 --> 2635.2
claiming he knew why the Discord server

2634.06 --> 2637.24
was shut down

2635.2 --> 2639.46
but that sort of thing probably won't

2637.24 --> 2641.68
happen if we voice verify new people in

2639.46 --> 2644.14
the future

2641.68 --> 2648.2799999999997
I'm not sure what he was up to

2644.14 --> 2650.859
well but he didn't actually do it

2648.28 --> 2652.3
he was just in a text

2650.859 --> 2653.74
right

2652.3 --> 2655.48
so

2653.74 --> 2657.819
do you mean that you have to have

2655.48 --> 2660.42
attacked even to be able to like enter

2657.819 --> 2660.42
the text

2660.7 --> 2666.5789999999997
to see the entire world so a newcomer

2664.599 --> 2667.2400000000002
can't do anything except going

2666.579 --> 2670.3590000000004
um

2667.24 --> 2672.5789999999997
the voice verify rooms

2670.359 --> 2674.44
right the members

2672.579 --> 2676.2400000000002
because the Discord issue was that

2674.44 --> 2678.64
someone waited until everyone had gone

2676.24 --> 2680.4399999999996
to sleep posted some stuff and then

2678.64 --> 2683.2599999999998
reported it from another account

2680.44 --> 2684.39
and that's how they got them shut down

2683.26 --> 2687.6000000000004
hmm

2684.39 --> 2687.6
[Music]

2688.06 --> 2692.16
right

2689.68 --> 2692.16
okay

2692.38 --> 2696.339
it's apparently quite common it's not

2694.54 --> 2697.24
just flat Earth people do this to lots

2696.339 --> 2699.22
of

2697.24 --> 2701.14
um servers just to see if they can get

2699.22 --> 2703.359
them taken down

2701.14 --> 2704.68
not like a game or something

2703.359 --> 2707.859
for some people

2704.68 --> 2711.1189999999997
well and I'm certain that it has

2707.859 --> 2714.5789999999997
absolutely nothing to do with attempt of

2711.119 --> 2717.1600000000003
covert Financial sabotage and all that

2714.579 --> 2719.8590000000004
like in relation to shorts and put

2717.16 --> 2722.98
options or anything probably and it has

2719.859 --> 2727.56
nothing to do with that at all I mean

2722.98 --> 2727.56
why would you think such a thing right

2728.859 --> 2731.619
yeah I mean it could have been anyone

2730.54 --> 2734.5
really couldn't it could have been a

2731.619 --> 2736.1800000000003
glue but seeking the opportunity yeah or

2734.5 --> 2737.44
it could have been somebody that was

2736.18 --> 2740.02
like hey

2737.44 --> 2741.63
we want this to crash so we can profit

2740.02 --> 2744.16
of this

2741.63 --> 2745.5
[Music]

2744.16 --> 2748.0
right

2745.5 --> 2749.079
if you think about it fed is actually

2748.0 --> 2751.42
quite a

2749.079 --> 2753.099
percentage of Flat Earth

2751.42 --> 2754.9
yeah I'm not really sure what anyone

2753.099 --> 2758.26
would want to Target Betty server

2754.9 --> 2760.78
especially because of the actual people

2758.26 --> 2765.1800000000003
that listen to us and are influenced by

2760.78 --> 2765.1800000000003
us and the metadata proves that

2765.4 --> 2770.2000000000003
you understand

2766.9 --> 2772.359
so if a channel doesn't matter how big

2770.2 --> 2775.2
the numbers are that might matter for

2772.359 --> 2778.06
their financial gains or whatever

2775.2 --> 2782.02
man I shouldn't have watched that thing

2778.06 --> 2785.339
now I'm like I'd become a Jew I'm

2782.02 --> 2785.339
thinking about this [ __ ] now

2785.92 --> 2794.819
but uh what was I saying uh

2790.54 --> 2794.819
I what the hell was I saying

2796.66 --> 2801.52
you still there that's probably best not

2799.48 --> 2803.079
to speculate isn't it if it was actually

2801.52 --> 2806.079
another Flat Earth or it's probably best

2803.079 --> 2808.78
not to oh wait no I remember again

2806.079 --> 2813.579
um what I was saying is that Flat Earth

2808.78 --> 2816.94
debates has a massive influence

2813.579 --> 2819.6400000000003
right it doesn't have the numbers but it

2816.94 --> 2822.28
has an actual reach it's the program

2819.64 --> 2825.8799999999997
that nobody dares to mention but

2822.28 --> 2828.46
everybody wants to know about

2825.88 --> 2831.1600000000003
see

2828.46 --> 2834.28
like Flat Earth debate has influence

2831.16 --> 2837.3999999999996
like with engineers and designers and

2834.28 --> 2839.8590000000004
people that are actually doing High

2837.4 --> 2842.26
function function yeah have high

2839.859 --> 2845.859
functions in society

2842.26 --> 2848.2000000000003
I'm certain of it you can see it you can

2845.859 --> 2850.839
see how the words spread around that

2848.2 --> 2852.22
what we talk about how we basically by

2850.839 --> 2856.0
what we address

2852.22 --> 2857.7999999999997
we create themes that Echo out even

2856.0 --> 2860.38
within art

2857.8 --> 2864.099
and this goes like to mainstream levels

2860.38 --> 2867.1600000000003
like to on TV type ship

2864.099 --> 2868.98
we have influence and so if we have

2867.16 --> 2874.0
influence then

2868.98 --> 2877.48
sabotaging us can like create a dip

2874.0 --> 2879.339
in or a ripple in everybody that

2877.48 --> 2882.94
typically listens to us and is

2879.339 --> 2887.0789999999997
influenced by us and thereby like could

2882.94 --> 2890.98
be see its Financial sabotage

2887.079 --> 2892.9
it could be it's like disrupting a group

2890.98 --> 2895.18
even though they don't even know what's

2892.9 --> 2898.7200000000003
going on everybody that's influenced by

2895.18 --> 2900.46
that group will get the shock of the

2898.72 --> 2904.359
sabotage and it might disrupt whatever

2900.46 --> 2905.2
they were doing or push them in into a

2904.359 --> 2907.38
choice

2905.2 --> 2910.5989999999997
that was already laid out right

2907.38 --> 2913.2400000000002
manipulation manipulation

2910.599 --> 2915.76
so every time something just gets hacked

2913.24 --> 2919.5
and taken down I always like okay who is

2915.76 --> 2919.5
who's going to benefit from this

2920.02 --> 2926.6
because it's not just a lead hack source

2924.04 --> 2930.22
that want to show that they're so badass

2926.6 --> 2933.5789999999997
[Music]

2930.22 --> 2935.3799999999997
it's illegal

2933.579 --> 2938.76
right

2935.38 --> 2938.76
it's illegal to do that

2943.96 --> 2948.4
yeah it's certainly not just the

2945.94 --> 2951.06
influence of fpd on certain people who

2948.4 --> 2953.56
go on lots of interviews

2951.06 --> 2955.48
laugh Dave for example I think he's

2953.56 --> 2958.359
picked up a lot of Nathan Willow and all

2955.48 --> 2959.859
of your points the trouble with your

2958.359 --> 2962.56
points is and what Nathan does

2959.859 --> 2964.7799999999997
specifically is that it's a bit it cuts

2962.56 --> 2966.88
both ways doesn't it it also cuts off a

2964.78 --> 2968.5600000000004
lot of the Feast of nonsense stuff which

2966.88 --> 2970.42
people don't like

2968.56 --> 2972.339
they like to be able to prove Flat Earth

2970.42 --> 2973.9
but they don't like to disprove their

2972.339 --> 2976.119
own ideas

2973.9 --> 2978.52
just sort of

2976.119 --> 2980.26
they can choose don't they and then when

2978.52 --> 2984.04
it comes to a head we see what happens

2980.26 --> 2985.5600000000004
with some other people well we pop dream

2984.04 --> 2990.64
bubbles see

2985.56 --> 2993.22
Nathan as a very as a tenacious act as

2990.64 --> 2995.02
an act principle of like bursting

2993.22 --> 2996.16
bubbles

2995.02 --> 2999.339
right

2996.16 --> 3002.7599999999998
that includes

2999.339 --> 3005.52
like scam bubbles

3002.76 --> 3008.8190000000004
right anything anything that is like

3005.52 --> 3011.04
that Nathan just has has a eye to pick

3008.819 --> 3012.599
it out and be like poop

3011.04 --> 3016.079
break it

3012.599 --> 3018.839
and that is like a trait that is an

3016.079 --> 3021.6600000000003
attitude of a person that he basically

3018.839 --> 3023.7
translates that he puts down a frequency

3021.66 --> 3026.64
of that a lot of people out there

3023.7 --> 3029.819
resonate with because they're surrounded

3026.64 --> 3033.48
by all people bullshitting Bubbles

3029.819 --> 3035.64
getting people caught and then just

3033.48 --> 3039.599
bleeding them dry

3035.64 --> 3043.3799999999997
scammers right and he's also very much

3039.599 --> 3046.2000000000003
about that about popping those bubbles

3043.38 --> 3048.1800000000003
about breaking that down and not just

3046.2 --> 3049.5589999999997
about Flat Earth it's not just oh we're

3048.18 --> 3051.0
gonna go against the globe we're gonna

3049.559 --> 3052.92
give it his all

3051.0 --> 3055.619
but then

3052.92 --> 3057.839
will behave exactly the same way when

3055.619 --> 3062.579
it's not directly about flat earth right

3057.839 --> 3065.5789999999997
like a politician like globusters team

3062.579 --> 3067.8590000000004
yeah Nathan specifically doesn't do that

3065.579 --> 3070.7400000000002
at the flight Earth debate we do don't

3067.859 --> 3074.819
do that we're not supposed to do that

3070.74 --> 3076.9799999999996
and that is a big influence there's a

3074.819 --> 3078.72
lot of people I know out there in the

3076.98 --> 3080.88
world that are resonating with that

3078.72 --> 3083.52
enormously

3080.88 --> 3085.6800000000003
see so there is an influence and when

3083.52 --> 3087.54
there's an influence there's a potential

3085.68 --> 3090.359
for sabotage

3087.54 --> 3093.0
with financial gain because that's how

3090.359 --> 3096.2999999999997
it all works I I've become a Jew

3093.0 --> 3098.64
overnight this is so annoying

3096.3 --> 3102.059
a Jew that doesn't even know how to make

3098.64 --> 3106.339
money personally but I know now more how

3102.059 --> 3106.3390000000004
it works how is the what's going on

3110.099 --> 3115.2000000000003
when I add anything to that

3112.92 --> 3117.059
a lot of it just seems to be passion for

3115.2 --> 3119.16
me because we like to see on telegram

3117.059 --> 3121.92
there's tens of thousands of people

3119.16 --> 3125.2799999999997
following tataria mud flood that sort of

3121.92 --> 3127.2000000000003
stuff Lisa and there's no financial gain

3125.28 --> 3128.28
in that as far as I know so it's just

3127.2 --> 3130.68
the

3128.28 --> 3134.6400000000003
being able to believe in something again

3130.68 --> 3137.7
I guess is where where the power is yeah

3134.64 --> 3141.5989999999997
but there is a value in that and a very

3137.7 --> 3143.7
specific setting for it right it's a

3141.599 --> 3146.819
comfortable Dream It's a hobby project

3143.7 --> 3149.2799999999997
something to distract you away from the

3146.819 --> 3152.7599999999998
Less Pleasant things out there

3149.28 --> 3155.3590000000004
right but if it were enhanced it can

3152.76 --> 3159.3
also distract you away from opportunity

3155.359 --> 3162.359
and potentially even be used as a mimic

3159.3 --> 3166.099
to trap you into a scam into an

3162.359 --> 3166.0989999999997
investment of something that's a scam

3169.619 --> 3173.2200000000003
yeah it's definitely a possibility I'm

3171.599 --> 3175.079
not I don't really come across it much

3173.22 --> 3177.48
myself I think most people just do super

3175.079 --> 3180.1800000000003
chats and that sort of stuff patreon

3177.48 --> 3182.339
maybe right

3180.18 --> 3185.16
well I know a lot of people don't like

3182.339 --> 3188.2999999999997
giving 30 to Google though yeah well

3185.16 --> 3188.2999999999997
that's why I've turned it off

3189.48 --> 3197.059
and because like I would also end up

3192.48 --> 3199.92
giving the rest of the 69 that's left so

3197.059 --> 3203.099
I wouldn't get any of it anyway I mean

3199.92 --> 3205.38
if I had some regular income and not on

3203.099 --> 3207.96
social welfare which I am

3205.38 --> 3209.819
and then I easily open it up

3207.96 --> 3212.2200000000003
because then it actually

3209.819 --> 3215.04
get something out of it now in my

3212.22 --> 3217.14
situation I don't

3215.04 --> 3219.619
huh

3217.14 --> 3219.6189999999997
right

3220.66 --> 3226.029
[Music]

3232.8 --> 3236.4
foreign

3234.18 --> 3239.819
but I do Wonder though

3236.4 --> 3242.28
like the anti-flat earthers

3239.819 --> 3245.099
I mean they must have like Financial

3242.28 --> 3247.26
things that they're doing

3245.099 --> 3250.2000000000003
and I really think that they're probably

3247.26 --> 3253.44
like involved with

3250.2 --> 3255.24
yeah investment corporations and Banks

3253.44 --> 3257.839
and [ __ ] and they are playing these

3255.24 --> 3257.839
types of games

3258.48 --> 3263.04
I mean you could feel it off them

3260.76 --> 3265.1400000000003
they're like that they are people like

3263.04 --> 3267.02
that

3265.14 --> 3271.2599999999998
foreign

3267.02 --> 3273.119
do have money Ruf is like a potentially

3271.26 --> 3275.8190000000004
like a billionaire or something even

3273.119 --> 3276.9
yeah we don't know but he's pretty

3275.819 --> 3280.339
loaded

3276.9 --> 3280.339
from what I've seen

3281.76 --> 3286.619
I've heard him about stock markets and

3283.92 --> 3289.7400000000002
all that so he is into that for sure and

3286.619 --> 3292.94
I think a lot of them out there are also

3289.74 --> 3292.9399999999996
and I wonder like

3295.319 --> 3301.02
they must realize that their business

3298.38 --> 3302.339
plan for what they do with the ball

3301.02 --> 3305.099
Earth

3302.339 --> 3308.2799999999997
that Flat Earth debate on the long term

3305.099 --> 3310.44
and long run must actually be a serious

3308.28 --> 3312.6600000000003
Financial Risk for them

3310.44 --> 3315.059
because the more time passes the more

3312.66 --> 3317.46
people will just start to look through

3315.059 --> 3319.8590000000004
their cheap act their temporary act

3317.46 --> 3322.68
contemporary Act

3319.859 --> 3324.2999999999997
and realize that pretty much every Point

3322.68 --> 3327.18
we've made at the Flat Earth debates

3324.3 --> 3328.98
most of it the the of all the parts that

3327.18 --> 3331.44
we haven't even corrected because we

3328.98 --> 3334.02
didn't need to because it was right

3331.44 --> 3335.7000000000003
that those things will just sink in more

3334.02 --> 3338.28
and more over time and people will just

3335.7 --> 3340.859
re will lose interest and we'll just see

3338.28 --> 3344.2200000000003
them as Spin Doctors and

3340.859 --> 3347.359
and not throw money at them anymore to

3344.22 --> 3347.359
save them from Flat Earth

3347.579 --> 3351.2400000000002
because I think that's what they're

3348.96 --> 3354.119
really trying to cash in on right now

3351.24 --> 3356.8799999999997
it's just people that are like

3354.119 --> 3359.7000000000003
but I love the globe I still want to go

3356.88 --> 3361.92
to space damn it and now these flat

3359.7 --> 3363.1189999999997
earthers are gonna ruin it for us all

3361.92 --> 3366.7200000000003
they're gonna

3363.119 --> 3369.859
change democracy so that like

3366.72 --> 3373.4399999999996
just like in interstellar people will

3369.859 --> 3376.38
de-prioritize go into space over making

3373.44 --> 3379.14
food how dare they

3376.38 --> 3382.5
so they're like ah quickly throw money

3379.14 --> 3385.98
at the anti-flat earther so that Society

3382.5 --> 3388.76
will not change I think that this is

3385.98 --> 3388.76
part of their model

3390.18 --> 3392.96
what do you think

3394.079 --> 3397.7400000000002
yeah I'm not really sure what they're up

3395.76 --> 3400.44
to but definitely with YouTube

3397.74 --> 3401.2799999999997
if you search right I always recommend

3400.44 --> 3403.98
them

3401.28 --> 3406.8590000000004
you always get a follow-on from one of

3403.98 --> 3408.54
if I don't choose personalized ads so if

3406.859 --> 3411.0589999999997
your show-ins and sometimes it will go

3408.54 --> 3414.0589999999997
to NASA or sometimes it will go to not a

3411.059 --> 3415.3700000000003
professor Dave so they definitely

3414.059 --> 3424.26
falling

3415.37 --> 3427.14
[Music]

3424.26 --> 3429.5400000000004
sorry about that

3427.14 --> 3432.48
say again

3429.54 --> 3434.819
I put a link in master D so people from

3432.48 --> 3437.42
the panel can join in if they want oh

3434.819 --> 3437.42
right yeah

3438.42 --> 3441.359
I know it's close to impossible to add

3440.28 --> 3444.1800000000003
in a

3441.359 --> 3445.74
Meats at the same time because Nathan

3444.18 --> 3447.96
sort of told me how to do it but it's

3445.74 --> 3450.4799999999996
extremely complicated to have a meets

3447.96 --> 3452.46
and a gilded at the same time

3450.48 --> 3455.4
I don't really know how he does that oh

3452.46 --> 3458.099
the Google meet thing right

3455.4 --> 3459.6600000000003
well he just takes like half an hour to

3458.099 --> 3462.0
put it all together he's got a system

3459.66 --> 3464.339
for it so

3462.0 --> 3467.46
I mean it's doable

3464.339 --> 3469.68
it's just kind of oh elaborate but yeah

3467.46 --> 3471.0
he does use the projector to literally

3469.68 --> 3473.5789999999997
have

3471.0 --> 3475.74
an enormous amount of space in front of

3473.579 --> 3478.2000000000003
him in with sorry that that he can

3475.74 --> 3480.9599999999996
actually have oversight so

3478.2 --> 3483.5989999999997
he basically has just a giant giant

3480.96 --> 3487.4
panel with all kinds of different things

3483.599 --> 3487.4
at the same time that he keeps track of

3491.76 --> 3494.46
yeah the hammer was trying to work that

3493.26 --> 3496.6800000000003
out and we were getting a little bit of

3494.46 --> 3499.16
Reverb on one end or the other but we're

3496.68 --> 3499.16
getting close

3499.2 --> 3505.3799999999997
a Reverb what

3502.2 --> 3508.5789999999997
like a double sound like a like a very

3505.38 --> 3508.579
close Echo oh

3509.64 --> 3514.74
okay

3511.859 --> 3516.72
that's just a software thing oh right

3514.74 --> 3518.3999999999996
right

3516.72 --> 3520.859
I hope

3518.4 --> 3523.2000000000003
um but um so yeah so people can Join

3520.859 --> 3527.339
This Server if they want to I think

3523.2 --> 3528.96
Scott's put a link in Fe gilded

3527.339 --> 3530.339
I think a lot of people have joined

3528.96 --> 3533.04
Betty's gilded

3530.339 --> 3535.5589999999997
um so they can hold their username on

3533.04 --> 3537.66
gilded so nobody else takes it and then

3535.559 --> 3540.8590000000004
they just sort of staying on Discord at

3537.66 --> 3540.859
the moment as far as I can tell

3541.079 --> 3544.559
the hold on to your name what do you

3542.88 --> 3546.42
mean you can't can't you just change

3544.559 --> 3548.52
your name

3546.42 --> 3549.599
I don't know I don't know we're just

3548.52 --> 3551.819
sort of like

3549.599 --> 3553.7400000000002
you know just making an account in case

3551.819 --> 3555.599
they want to use it but I noticed that

3553.74 --> 3558.24
maybe 10 people come on Nathan's show

3555.599 --> 3561.2000000000003
not anymore but we've got 120 or so

3558.24 --> 3561.2
members on veggies

3563.24 --> 3567.359
I guess most people just want to listen

3565.5 --> 3569.819
in or

3567.359 --> 3571.68
walk outside of the show yeah well there

3569.819 --> 3573.9
is that there's a lot of people that are

3571.68 --> 3576.1189999999997
actually listening to the show over

3573.9 --> 3577.2000000000003
Discord because they don't want to go on

3576.119 --> 3580.6400000000003
to

3577.2 --> 3580.64
Google or YouTube

3581.819 --> 3586.799
foreign that used to be the case whereas

3584.64 --> 3590.48
like 50 people in there nobody's talking

3586.799 --> 3590.48
they're all just listening

3591.839 --> 3595.38
yeah

3592.799 --> 3597.42
yeah I think Nathan Ken in the future

3595.38 --> 3599.04
especially with his new pc he can

3597.42 --> 3602.339
broadcast the Odyssey at the same time

3599.04 --> 3603.7799999999997
or D live at the same time and then you

3602.339 --> 3605.22
get more interaction with people who

3603.78 --> 3606.7200000000003
don't like YouTube

3605.22 --> 3608.5789999999997
because a lot of people have been banned

3606.72 --> 3612.4199999999996
from YouTube over the last two years as

3608.579 --> 3614.4
I'm sure you're aware oh really I had no

3612.42 --> 3617.339
idea

3614.4 --> 3618.78
Oh you mean they have had their channels

3617.339 --> 3621.599
banned from YouTube

3618.78 --> 3623.8390000000004
or did you mean had me ban them from the

3621.599 --> 3623.839
chat

3623.9 --> 3628.02
YouTube censorship you know because the

3626.339 --> 3630.0
last two years and the stuff going on

3628.02 --> 3632.22
right yeah yeah two channels getting

3630.0 --> 3634.26
deleted and all that yeah

3632.22 --> 3637.14
well that's been going on by the way for

3634.26 --> 3640.1400000000003
a long time even before

3637.14 --> 3642.359
like the whole covet nonsense happened

3640.14 --> 3643.6189999999997
that sort of [ __ ] would happen for other

3642.359 --> 3646.98
reasons

3643.619 --> 3649.26
so I mean YouTube has been doing such

3646.98 --> 3651.78
things for quite some time but like with

3649.26 --> 3655.7400000000002
the whole covet rollout they kind of

3651.78 --> 3658.44
like try to justify it not keep it under

3655.74 --> 3660.66
wraps right because before they would

3658.44 --> 3662.7000000000003
just like ah delete it no nobody's

3660.66 --> 3664.74
talking about it they just do it

3662.7 --> 3666.96
secretly and then

3664.74 --> 3669.18
covet was like oh yeah if you bring up

3666.96 --> 3671.16
Miracle this information

3669.18 --> 3673.0789999999997
then we take you down so they kind of

3671.16 --> 3675.1189999999997
like officially started doing it but

3673.079 --> 3677.46
they've been like Banning channels for

3675.119 --> 3680.299
quite a while

3677.46 --> 3680.299
I mean

3680.76 --> 3683.7200000000003
quite a while

3684.25 --> 3687.599
[Music]

3692.819 --> 3697.079
yeah so a lot of people don't like um

3694.859 --> 3698.64
using YouTube now because someone they

3697.079 --> 3701.04
like someone they follow has been struck

3698.64 --> 3702.7799999999997
off YouTube so they just stay on Odyssey

3701.04 --> 3704.46
or glitch you and that's actually where

3702.78 --> 3706.26
I first look for stuff because I thought

3704.46 --> 3707.28
you wouldn't find it on YouTube to be

3706.26 --> 3708.96
honest

3707.28 --> 3711.6600000000003
little did I know that they actually

3708.96 --> 3713.7
allow it right they encourage certain

3711.66 --> 3716.46
types of it

3713.7 --> 3718.9199999999996
now that makes sense I mean when it

3716.46 --> 3721.38
comes to like the inter integral medical

3718.92 --> 3722.4
videos I really like the look on bit

3721.38 --> 3725.1600000000003
shoot

3722.4 --> 3727.319
but also Odyssey but mostly [ __ ]

3725.16 --> 3729.299
there's like space Busters is there

3727.319 --> 3731.94
which is really one of the best most

3729.299 --> 3734.7
researched channels in my opinion

3731.94 --> 3736.38
that takes it to that next level where

3734.7 --> 3739.2
I've gone

3736.38 --> 3741.299
like viruses don't actually exist and

3739.2 --> 3743.8799999999997
why that's all

3741.299 --> 3745.619
um just to concentrate on health

3743.88 --> 3747.48
sorry

3745.619 --> 3748.799
they stopped doing Flat Earth stuff

3747.48 --> 3750.54
space Busters just to do the health

3748.799 --> 3751.74
stuff for the last two years because I

3750.54 --> 3753.599
think one of the last things they did

3751.74 --> 3756.4799999999996
was The Ether stuff I think

3753.599 --> 3758.7000000000003
before health is that true

3756.48 --> 3761.2400000000002
I don't know about that I don't know if

3758.7 --> 3761.24
they came up

3761.359 --> 3767.88
on Easter part two

3764.4 --> 3770.54
okay what was it what was it I haven't

3767.88 --> 3770.54
seen that one

3770.819 --> 3775.5589999999997
um it's about how like connecting ether

3773.46 --> 3777.799
with Chi and how some people claim they

3775.559 --> 3781.619
can set fire to things with their hands

3777.799 --> 3785.4
right spiritual either okay not stupid

3781.619 --> 3788.1600000000003
light based ether okay fine

3785.4 --> 3790.14
spiritual ether sure I mean there's so

3788.16 --> 3792.8999999999996
many ethers so

3790.14 --> 3797.22
right there's the electric ether there's

3792.9 --> 3799.859
the spirit ether there's the radio and

3797.22 --> 3802.98
wireless transmission ether then there's

3799.859 --> 3805.14
the elemental ether the Ancient One

3802.98 --> 3807.54
right uh

3805.14 --> 3810.5
did I miss anything

3807.54 --> 3812.7
there's like eight

3810.5 --> 3814.38
I guess someone said to me that there's

3812.7 --> 3816.839
The Ether and then there's the effers

3814.38 --> 3818.88
and they're all connected somehow for

3816.839 --> 3821.4
Less

3818.88 --> 3822.599
and they're not there's quite a diverse

3821.4 --> 3824.64
group of people actually because a lot

3822.599 --> 3826.559
of people come from the King wheeler

3824.64 --> 3828.66
camp but then there's some people who

3826.559 --> 3830.099
started out with Ken wheeler but then

3828.66 --> 3832.6189999999997
don't really know anything about its

3830.099 --> 3835.5
modern stuff so his modern stuff is like

3832.619 --> 3838.1400000000003
heliocentric cosmology stuff I know Ken

3835.5 --> 3840.119
Wheeler's pretty pathetic

3838.14 --> 3842.0989999999997
because they're flat earthers so they

3840.119 --> 3844.859
don't like his cosmology space-time

3842.099 --> 3846.599
nonsense so they they don't really know

3844.859 --> 3848.22
that Ken wheeler has gone this direction

3846.599 --> 3850.2000000000003
But soonly Ken wheeler has gone this

3848.22 --> 3852.48
direction because it's popular it's like

3850.2 --> 3854.7
a heliocentric electric Universe type

3852.48 --> 3856.859
stuff as far as I know yeah he's just

3854.7 --> 3859.2599999999998
moving on to another story playground

3856.859 --> 3862.5589999999997
that's all

3859.26 --> 3866.0400000000004
right but can wheeler look Ken wheeler

3862.559 --> 3868.8590000000004
is so highly overestimated I mean he's a

3866.04 --> 3871.44
good wizard he's pretty good he invented

3868.859 --> 3872.819
the wheelie as I like to call it the

3871.44 --> 3875.64
spin around

3872.819 --> 3878.16
where you just scatter gun with like

3875.64 --> 3880.0789999999997
what is ether oh well look at this thing

3878.16 --> 3882.299
with electricity

3880.079 --> 3884.2200000000003
that's ether and look at that thing

3882.299 --> 3886.619
something else that is either and look

3884.22 --> 3888.0
at that thing something again else this

3886.619 --> 3890.7000000000003
is ether and it's either it's not

3888.0 --> 3892.5
manifested till you know it has to be

3890.7 --> 3894.96
there

3892.5 --> 3897.24
right ether

3894.96 --> 3899.579
you know it's there because it's

3897.24 --> 3902.52
non-manifested

3899.579 --> 3905.1600000000003
like that it's The Ether wheelie it's

3902.52 --> 3909.24
just all these things that actually do

3905.16 --> 3912.299
not address anything of the any question

3909.24 --> 3915.359
this combination of the story is The

3912.299 --> 3918.299
Ether just like gravity nobody knows

3915.359 --> 3922.0789999999997
what it is but the combination like oh

3918.299 --> 3923.66
the consistent acceleration rate and Oh

3922.079 --> 3927.8390000000004
look The

3923.66 --> 3930.72
the axis that would have have to form in

3927.839 --> 3932.64
in like how things displace because of

3930.72 --> 3934.5589999999997
the force nudge of gravity even though

3932.64 --> 3936.72
the gravity is not a force right so

3934.559 --> 3939.299
another unrelated thing associated with

3936.72 --> 3942.54
why gravity has to be and just one thing

3939.299 --> 3945.54
after the other it's all spun together

3942.54 --> 3947.04
typically for an aberration into one

3945.54 --> 3949.5589999999997
thing

3947.04 --> 3951.9
but if you take every section every

3949.559 --> 3954.96
element of it separately then it doesn't

3951.9 --> 3957.9
make any sense ether the Ken wheeler

3954.96 --> 3961.44
ether is exactly the same right as I

3957.9 --> 3963.42
said earlier like there's like six five

3961.44 --> 3966.18
ethers dedicated on the top of my head

3963.42 --> 3968.2200000000003
oh yeah chemical ether is one on the top

3966.18 --> 3970.02
of my head I could just like Name six

3968.22 --> 3972.72
totally different ethers that have

3970.02 --> 3976.14
absolutely nothing to do with each other

3972.72 --> 3977.3999999999996
but that are like in the vernacular of

3976.14 --> 3981.18
people

3977.4 --> 3983.7000000000003
right well Ken wheeler basically took

3981.18 --> 3987.1189999999997
all of these little thingies put them

3983.7 --> 3991.14
into uh put a thread right through it

3987.119 --> 3993.1800000000003
and sue them all together into a wheelie

3991.14 --> 3997.5589999999997
so that's certainly all these separate

3993.18 --> 3998.7
things can be reified into One Singular

3997.559 --> 4002.6800000000003
thing

3998.7 --> 4002.68
and that's the true aberration

4003.26 --> 4007.3590000000004
see that's the wheelie trick

4008.059 --> 4012.98
yeah I can't really watch much of him

4010.039 --> 4015.079
but do you understand what I mean though

4012.98 --> 4018.5
have you ever been through like him

4015.079 --> 4020.48
explaining or anybody else I mean Bob no

4018.5 --> 4022.46
Dell will explain it like that which it

4020.48 --> 4024.38
will explain it like that they all do

4022.46 --> 4026.839
the same thing they all perform the

4024.38 --> 4029.78
wheelie right

4026.839 --> 4031.4
scatter gunning from one this argument

4029.78 --> 4033.3190000000004
oh the next argument oh the next

4031.4 --> 4035.96
argument the next and never ever

4033.319 --> 4038.839
resolving it really is just ethos this

4035.96 --> 4041.539
oh wait yeah this is also that and it's

4038.839 --> 4043.839
also that but none of it actually is

4041.539 --> 4043.8390000000004
anything

4044.18 --> 4048.14
yeah they say lots without explaining

4045.92 --> 4051.2000000000003
anything yeah right scatter gunning a

4048.14 --> 4054.2
wheelie one thing to another it's like

4051.2 --> 4056.48
making a wheel of bullets being fired

4054.2 --> 4059.1189999999997
and then expecting that you can actually

4056.48 --> 4063.4
ride on it like a tire

4059.119 --> 4063.4
but it's literally just bullets flying

4065.119 --> 4073.839
foreign

4066.24 --> 4077.0
[Music]

4073.839 --> 4080.0589999999997
subscribers Ken wheeler

4077.0 --> 4081.859
well he does have a lot to show for it I

4080.059 --> 4085.28
mean he does have like the best

4081.859 --> 4088.24
interesting man-made gadgets

4085.28 --> 4091.6400000000003
that he can show off and be like Oh

4088.24 --> 4093.859
science look at this electric and a

4091.64 --> 4096.38
light thingy look it's so science it's

4093.859 --> 4098.96
so science

4096.38 --> 4099.7390000000005
and then talk his wheelie [ __ ] about

4098.96 --> 4100.88
it

4099.739 --> 4103.218999999999
right

4100.88 --> 4105.799
oh look this and that though that means

4103.219 --> 4106.819
I was right it is that this and that and

4105.799 --> 4108.44
that blah

4106.819 --> 4112.339000000001
blah blah that's what he does it's just

4108.44 --> 4115.639999999999
a wizard I mean I on the internet he is

4112.339 --> 4118.8189999999995
one of the most fitting

4115.64 --> 4122.0
when come his profile fits like one of

4118.819 --> 4124.46
the best for like what I would see as a

4122.0 --> 4127.04
techno babbling wizard

4124.46 --> 4129.38
pretty much more than anybody I've ever

4127.04 --> 4132.38
seen on the internet

4129.38 --> 4135.62
because he's really focused on that

4132.38 --> 4137.900000000001
and he's good at it I mean he he's he

4135.62 --> 4140.0
made that wheelie

4137.9 --> 4142.94
I mean he really did

4140.0 --> 4145.219
and he's good at it and he he does it

4142.94 --> 4146.299
intuitively I mean he improvises these

4145.219 --> 4148.279
things

4146.299 --> 4150.56
this is not something he has to read off

4148.279 --> 4152.6
a script that he preferably carefully

4150.56 --> 4156.319
prepared like

4152.6 --> 4160.64
the the hours before now he does this by

4156.319 --> 4163.04
heart so he is pretty impressive at it

4160.64 --> 4165.1990000000005
it's just that the end result is a

4163.04 --> 4167.359
freaking ether wheelie and it's super

4165.199 --> 4169.04
annoying because people think it's all

4167.359 --> 4170.42
the [ __ ] and they just start repeating

4169.04 --> 4174.58
it

4170.42 --> 4174.58
like a psychological weapon

4176.06 --> 4180.7390000000005
because that's kind of what it is

4178.759 --> 4182.96
anyway and

4180.739 --> 4184.459999999999
anybody here in the YouTube chat still

4182.96 --> 4186.7390000000005
around

4184.46 --> 4188.779
are you enjoying this conversation I'm

4186.739 --> 4190.759
kind of enjoying it

4188.779 --> 4193.660000000001
Paul it's nice to have somebody to talk

4190.759 --> 4196.04
to again on my show

4193.66 --> 4199.099999999999
here we have a guest occasionally there

4196.04 --> 4202.28
on Skype or something

4199.1 --> 4204.4400000000005
I used to but that's like two years ago

4202.28 --> 4206.599999999999
last

4204.44 --> 4209.839999999999
it's been a long time

4206.6 --> 4211.76
I really can you imagine that for like

4209.84 --> 4215.6
two years

4211.76 --> 4219.400000000001
it was just me on camera every day and

4215.6 --> 4219.400000000001
that somehow worked

4222.34 --> 4226.82
ready

4224.26 --> 4229.04
oh yeah I think Neil's been trying to

4226.82 --> 4231.799999999999
join for a bit we can't get in so oh

4229.04 --> 4234.8
yeah sure you can come in

4231.8 --> 4237.92
yeah it must be a technical problem is

4234.8 --> 4239.42
end up I'll send an invite but it's

4237.92 --> 4241.04
always sometimes it depends if you're

4239.42 --> 4243.62
still on his phone because if he's got

4241.04 --> 4245.48
Skype open and guild at the same time

4243.62 --> 4247.82
Gilda doesn't like that you have to

4245.48 --> 4249.739
close everything but yielded

4247.82 --> 4253.46
if you're on an iPhone

4249.739 --> 4255.0199999999995
I don't know I think he is on one

4253.46 --> 4256.4
but he said he was at home today that's

4255.02 --> 4258.8
why there's not a show because you know

4256.4 --> 4261.92
the curse of Neil not working right

4258.8 --> 4264.64
which is true isn't it

4261.92 --> 4264.64
foreign

4267.32 --> 4273.04
and then

4269.0 --> 4273.04
there will always be flat Earth debates

4277.219 --> 4281.12
we could move over to MIDI server if you

4280.28 --> 4282.92
want

4281.12 --> 4285.46
um that way people won't be able to join

4282.92 --> 4285.46
more easily

4286.179 --> 4292.159
okay who is in there

4289.88 --> 4293.96
oh no one at the moment but

4292.159 --> 4296.0
I'm not sure if there's an issue joining

4293.96 --> 4297.5
my service specifically but Neil is in

4296.0 --> 4300.08
there already and he's got the role to

4297.5 --> 4302.0
see the group so can't you invite him in

4300.08 --> 4305.179
here

4302.0 --> 4308.8
yeah I did I sent an invite but um

4305.179 --> 4308.8
he's not coming just yet

4314.89 --> 4319.52
[Music]

4317.3 --> 4321.14
I don't think Neil was too keen on

4319.52 --> 4323.780000000001
Discord either so he's probably not that

4321.14 --> 4328.06
familiar with this type of system

4323.78 --> 4328.0599999999995
now when he has been on here I think

4329.239 --> 4333.08
wasn't he already

4334.159 --> 4337.159
the ball busters mostly

4336.07 --> 4339.139999999999
[Music]

4337.159 --> 4342.86
right but wasn't he there on ball

4339.14 --> 4345.64
busters this Saturday as well

4342.86 --> 4345.639999999999
not sure

4347.15 --> 4350.21
[Music]

4350.78 --> 4353.92
anyway we'll see

4355.52 --> 4358.580000000001
yeah Adam could join us couldn't he

4357.42 --> 4362.14
[Music]

4358.58 --> 4362.14
he's there in chat

4365.54 --> 4370.4
I'm getting some feedback apparently or

4367.76 --> 4372.76
the guys in the chatter getting some

4370.4 --> 4372.759999999999
feedback

4380.72 --> 4384.119000000001
[Music]

4385.48 --> 4391.459999999999
all right

4387.86 --> 4391.46
[Music]

4396.26 --> 4398.4400000000005
thank you

4414.38 --> 4418.719
if I can are you getting any feedback

4416.36 --> 4418.719
now Adam

4428.659 --> 4431.5599999999995
hopefully not

4431.92 --> 4435.159
thank you Adam

4440.84 --> 4444.4400000000005
you did YouTube so I can't tell what it

4443.12 --> 4447.0199999999995
sounds like on there because otherwise

4444.44 --> 4448.46
I'd have to um deaf and gilded and then

4447.02 --> 4449.96
I don't think I can talk either if I

4448.46 --> 4451.94
deaf and gilded because it mutual as

4449.96 --> 4454.76
well right

4451.94 --> 4458.199
no but it was really just my microphone

4454.76 --> 4458.1990000000005
versus my speakers

4461.84 --> 4465.08
yeah Nathan's got a good setup but he's

4463.699 --> 4467.0599999999995
probably spent a long time working on

4465.08 --> 4469.3
that so his mic doesn't pick up his

4467.06 --> 4469.3
speakers

4479.06 --> 4483.26
right so we're talking about space

4481.159 --> 4485.679999999999
Busters weren't we and their um videos

4483.26 --> 4487.159000000001
that they've done

4485.68 --> 4490.159000000001
[Music]

4487.159 --> 4492.5599999999995
right about I think just like more

4490.159 --> 4493.5199999999995
detailed information we find on bit

4492.56 --> 4496.52
shoot

4493.52 --> 4500.3
and odyssey apparently also and not so

4496.52 --> 4502.820000000001
much on YouTube but on YouTube is

4500.3 --> 4507.38
I do think that YouTube still is kind of

4502.82 --> 4507.38
like a social media representation

4507.62 --> 4512.26
thing hey one deck low

4512.84 --> 4518.0
but yeah but I do think that YouTube is

4515.659 --> 4522.259999999999
just like a place where people can have

4518.0 --> 4524.36
a more stable media presence I mean

4522.26 --> 4528.76
there really is that thing of just like

4524.36 --> 4528.759999999999
going live on your YouTube channel

4531.32 --> 4537.219
it building

4533.239 --> 4540.139999999999
just yeah I mean YouTube is so wide

4537.219 --> 4543.38
you always just have a much wider

4540.14 --> 4545.84
potential audience there

4543.38 --> 4548.36
I don't know what it is maybe it's just

4545.84 --> 4550.58
me having stuck to YouTube for such a

4548.36 --> 4552.799999999999
long time

4550.58 --> 4554.6
well it is a very good platform and the

4552.8 --> 4556.219
algorithm does help you find good videos

4554.6 --> 4558.320000000001
based on the things you like And

4556.219 --> 4560.36
subscribe to so it does work really well

4558.32 --> 4563.32
because YouTube didn't design it they

4560.36 --> 4563.32
bought it didn't they so

4566.22 --> 4569.719
[Music]

4567.739 --> 4572.12
it's one of the best it's one of the

4569.719 --> 4574.04
best video programs I think you can find

4572.12 --> 4575.84
I mean people seem to like broadcasting

4574.04 --> 4577.58
from it it's functionality and that sort

4575.84 --> 4579.4400000000005
of thing I think some of the things like

4577.58 --> 4581.239
Odyssey can be a bit more clunky a bit

4579.44 --> 4582.799999999999
more difficult to manage

4581.239 --> 4584.659
but then they don't have the budget that

4582.8 --> 4586.52
YouTube had

4584.659 --> 4589.759999999999
right

4586.52 --> 4591.679
and they don't have the server a room

4589.76 --> 4594.62
I mean that's really where YouTube and

4591.679 --> 4597.5
Google stand out so much that they just

4594.62 --> 4599.739
have this insane amount of servers

4597.5 --> 4599.739
available

4601.76 --> 4608.42
but yeah the problem is that they're

4604.699 --> 4610.639999999999
the majority of their

4608.42 --> 4612.7390000000005
of their capabilities they kind of just

4610.64 --> 4616.42
like abuse politically

4612.739 --> 4616.419999999999
and that's really annoying

4618.56 --> 4622.280000000001
we you have to assume that someone at

4620.54 --> 4623.9
some point went to Google or YouTube and

4622.28 --> 4625.82
just said look you can't allow this

4623.9 --> 4628.099999999999
stuff anymore if you do we're gonna

4625.82 --> 4630.08
start making some extra taxes against

4628.1 --> 4631.64
you because they have special deals

4630.08 --> 4634.34
Google now so they don't pay anything

4631.64 --> 4636.02
hardly in a lot of countries

4634.34 --> 4638.0
so there's a lot that can be done to

4636.02 --> 4640.040000000001
them that's not currently being done

4638.0 --> 4644.08
let's guess how they would respond to

4640.04 --> 4644.08
that but there already is attacks

4644.6 --> 4651.38
there is tax well not to Google itself

4647.54 --> 4652.58
but to people that yeah that get income

4651.38 --> 4654.62
from Google

4652.58 --> 4658.48
so

4654.62 --> 4658.48
at least in the United States there is

4660.26 --> 4663.320000000001
yeah they still want you to pay if

4662.06 --> 4665.719
you're outside the United States don't

4663.32 --> 4667.699
they which is interesting first

4665.719 --> 4669.44
we like the EU they want people to do

4667.699 --> 4671.599999999999
their tax returns for them and collect

4669.44 --> 4672.139999999999
that for them if you sell to the EU but

4671.6 --> 4673.9400000000005
um

4672.14 --> 4675.7390000000005
that's voluntary so I'm not sure why

4673.94 --> 4676.879999999999
anyone would do that

4675.739 --> 4678.919999999999
hmm

4676.88 --> 4681.02
but I could send stuff to Europe and I

4678.92 --> 4682.88
could charge that and collect for them

4681.02 --> 4685.040000000001
and send it to the EU but then I'd have

4682.88 --> 4687.4400000000005
to take account of all the different vat

4685.04 --> 4689.679
rates in Europe so that's just a pain in

4687.44 --> 4689.678999999999
the ass

4691.76 --> 4694.9400000000005
doing their bookkeeping for them for

4694.04 --> 4697.94
free

4694.94 --> 4697.94
right

4698.179 --> 4701.6
well that's the favorite thing isn't it

4700.52 --> 4705.6990000000005
it's just

4701.6 --> 4705.6990000000005
make the employees just do everything

4708.5 --> 4712.219
well that is how fascism Works doesn't

4710.3 --> 4714.26
it you get the companies to do the stuff

4712.219 --> 4716.179
that the government can't do

4714.26 --> 4718.04
and people like

4716.179 --> 4720.14
social media companies are very useful

4718.04 --> 4722.179
in the fascia system aren't they because

4720.14 --> 4724.64
they basically control people's lives

4722.179 --> 4726.679
now along with banks

4724.64 --> 4728.96
and telecoms companies for the internet

4726.679 --> 4731.4800000000005
if you get them to put in put in place

4728.96 --> 4732.9800000000005
rules like ID and stuff like I think

4731.48 --> 4734.9
they're trying to go for this digital ID

4732.98 --> 4737.12
for the internet aren't they so you have

4734.9 --> 4738.259999999999
to have an ID to access online as the

4737.12 --> 4740.659
idea

4738.26 --> 4743.360000000001
well they've been trying they've been

4740.659 --> 4746.839999999999
rolling out that idea

4743.36 --> 4749.36
for over a decade

4746.84 --> 4752.360000000001
I mean if that happens the internet's

4749.36 --> 4754.46
gone it's over then

4752.36 --> 4756.62
because what actually made it work is

4754.46 --> 4757.46
that it's so freaking easy to get on

4756.62 --> 4759.92
there

4757.46 --> 4761.659
that you don't need to own anything you

4759.92 --> 4764.719
just need access

4761.659 --> 4767.719
right well if they do that and you need

4764.719 --> 4769.76
like a digital identification

4767.719 --> 4771.32
Etc then it's just over

4769.76 --> 4773.659000000001
[Music]

4771.32 --> 4777.4
or accept tour would probably get a bit

4773.659 --> 4777.4
more user-friendly if they did that

4779.6 --> 4783.860000000001
well they don't like the dark web yeah

4781.28 --> 4787.699
but I don't know if that then Works look

4783.86 --> 4788.96
what you see if you then like go in VPN

4787.699 --> 4791.719
somewhere

4788.96 --> 4793.64
well then it's like oh so you're going

4791.719 --> 4795.38
through some weird random

4793.64 --> 4797.42
person

4795.38 --> 4799.34
well

4797.42 --> 4801.679
they're just gonna figure out that

4799.34 --> 4805.42
you're not really an identified person

4801.679 --> 4805.42
and and then you'll be locked out

4806.48 --> 4811.639999999999
right it's not about having your

4809.0 --> 4814.04
information kept hidden so that people

4811.64 --> 4816.320000000001
can identify you it's like oh so you

4814.04 --> 4820.04
don't provide identification upon entry

4816.32 --> 4822.139999999999
no entry then right so

4820.04 --> 4824.179
what do you mean VPN tour that wouldn't

4822.14 --> 4826.219
matter anymore

4824.179 --> 4828.08
well I mean the dark web just uses the

4826.219 --> 4830.659
infrastructure but it doesn't use their

4828.08 --> 4832.4
software so if you set up a tour now

4830.659 --> 4835.0599999999995
they probably run their own servers to

4832.4 --> 4839.42
run tour oh dark web

4835.06 --> 4841.52
yeah yeah but I don't know I have no

4839.42 --> 4843.62
idea if that still would work I mean

4841.52 --> 4846.080000000001
they they probably will try to do

4843.62 --> 4848.599999999999
something against that as well

4846.08 --> 4850.46
because if that just then develops

4848.6 --> 4852.26
further further people can literally

4850.46 --> 4854.78
just make like dark

4852.26 --> 4857.38
web interfaces

4854.78 --> 4860.719
where it's like just

4857.38 --> 4862.82
yeah you could have like a completely

4860.719 --> 4866.42
Anonymous interface

4862.82 --> 4868.94
that would just like hide in between the

4866.42 --> 4870.56
regular official internet

4868.94 --> 4873.0199999999995
I don't know

4870.56 --> 4874.34
it's getting a bit beyond me so I

4873.02 --> 4876.5
imagine people like three letter

4874.34 --> 4878.54
agencies like the dark web for their own

4876.5 --> 4880.1
activities so they could probably keep

4878.54 --> 4882.38
something like that like a back door

4880.1 --> 4884.0
open and of course clever people find

4882.38 --> 4885.7390000000005
these back doors so they can use them

4884.0 --> 4887.3
well the dark web's never going to go

4885.739 --> 4889.639999999999
down I mean how else are they gonna

4887.3 --> 4893.7390000000005
smuggle children and

4889.64 --> 4893.7390000000005
and illegal drugs and [ __ ] so

4893.96 --> 4897.26
you know

4895.52 --> 4899.3
it's definitely a good Revenue source

4897.26 --> 4901.219
for him that's true yeah no but it's the

4899.3 --> 4903.62
only way they can do it

4901.219 --> 4905.84
right now

4903.62 --> 4908.12
except just through like government

4905.84 --> 4909.38
corruption and bribing and blackmailing

4908.12 --> 4912.14
people

4909.38 --> 4914.12
but dark web makes it a lot easier and

4912.14 --> 4918.46
just less

4914.12 --> 4918.46
Loose Ends to worry about

4919.34 --> 4926.3
so that's not gonna go away

4922.54 --> 4928.82
look I don't think this idea of oh

4926.3 --> 4930.320000000001
digital digital internet and they're

4928.82 --> 4934.179
going to change it like I don't believe

4930.32 --> 4934.179
it I don't think it's gonna happen it's

4935.6 --> 4943.400000000001
I mean that it's too much right

4940.219 --> 4946.0
look at where's already so dependent on

4943.4 --> 4948.98
internet activities and things just to

4946.0 --> 4951.62
survive this freaking crisis situation

4948.98 --> 4953.0
where we're being besieged and deprived

4951.62 --> 4956.12
of energy

4953.0 --> 4959.36
and other stuff right

4956.12 --> 4962.179
I mean if you just turn it off then

4959.36 --> 4963.92
people will literally have nothing left

4962.179 --> 4966.02
to hold them back

4963.92 --> 4968.42
of just burning the entire place down

4966.02 --> 4971.120000000001
and with the entire place I mean the

4968.42 --> 4974.06
very specific politicians and conspiring

4971.12 --> 4974.7699999999995
industrialists their houses and all

4974.06 --> 4977.6
their possessions

4974.77 --> 4979.64
[Music]

4977.6 --> 4982.46
so

4979.64 --> 4985.46
they can't they can't take it away

4982.46 --> 4989.7390000000005
everything will totally collapse too

4985.46 --> 4989.7390000000005
rapidly if they did can't do it

4993.739 --> 4997.159
they sort of offer these things don't

4995.36 --> 4998.78
they and if a good number of people join

4997.159 --> 5001.0
up they start to try and make them

4998.78 --> 5003.28
mandatory which you still need to agree

5001.0 --> 5005.5
to but they make it sound like an order

5003.28 --> 5007.48
and then they go into sanctioning people

5005.5 --> 5009.699
who don't join but that's only once they

5007.48 --> 5011.919999999999
get the numbers so people just need to

5009.699 --> 5015.219
not agree to this new digital ID stuff

5011.92 --> 5017.7390000000005
it's all voluntary based what they do is

5015.219 --> 5020.679
all voluntary based even their Eugenics

5017.739 --> 5022.54
death system it's all voluntary based

5020.679 --> 5025.42
and

5022.54 --> 5028.179
I don't like it but maybe there could be

5025.42 --> 5031.659
worse systems in place instead

5028.179 --> 5034.179
so indeed just don't take part of it

5031.659 --> 5036.219
just literally ignore them to death just

5034.179 --> 5038.679
build everything from scratch imagine

5036.219 --> 5042.04
like there's literally nothing out there

5038.679 --> 5045.76
and you only can start from scratch

5042.04 --> 5048.76
and just don't build anything on

5045.76 --> 5052.3
anything that they own

5048.76 --> 5054.9400000000005
nothing not a single thing like no

5052.3 --> 5060.58
interaction and you will be safe

5054.94 --> 5064.08
you will be less Rich less connected but

5060.58 --> 5064.08
you will be actually safe

5067.12 --> 5071.8
probably not true of people in major

5069.28 --> 5073.659
cities though you need to be with some

5071.8 --> 5074.5
country around you don't need to be able

5073.659 --> 5076.0
to live

5074.5 --> 5078.159
self-sufficiently

5076.0 --> 5080.62
you need to be able to hunt and stuff if

5078.159 --> 5083.199
you're really outside the system

5080.62 --> 5085.179
now I'm not talking about outside the

5083.199 --> 5088.9
system I mean

5085.179 --> 5091.0
there's yeah that's just like go outdoor

5088.9 --> 5092.379999999999
nature and get lost right that's not

5091.0 --> 5093.52
really what I'm talking about I'm

5092.38 --> 5095.02
talking about

5093.52 --> 5097.780000000001
just

5095.02 --> 5100.96
Mega corporations that are obviously

5097.78 --> 5102.88
satanic and evil and dark and look at

5100.96 --> 5105.94
where they're investing and literally

5102.88 --> 5109.06
retract from everything they touch it's

5105.94 --> 5111.159
like oh oh you you will allow yourself

5109.06 --> 5114.400000000001
to be assimilated by that Mega

5111.159 --> 5117.159
Corporation then we all retract and we

5114.4 --> 5118.239
literally let you burn and bleed to

5117.159 --> 5120.4
death

5118.239 --> 5124.678999999999
yeah oh you want to be part of the

5120.4 --> 5124.679
monster die then die

5125.199 --> 5131.98
that should be the response like oh oh

5127.96 --> 5133.3
you want to invoke your covet policy on

5131.98 --> 5136.36
your star

5133.3 --> 5140.56
boycott it immediately let it literally

5136.36 --> 5143.08
go bust as quickly as humanly possible

5140.56 --> 5146.7390000000005
right that's the only weapon we really

5143.08 --> 5150.04
got against this system is Mass

5146.739 --> 5152.739
formation but not psychosis but a mass

5150.04 --> 5156.1
formation of determination where you

5152.739 --> 5159.5199999999995
literally just say like oh this is the

5156.1 --> 5160.96
enemy of everyone you will not be

5159.52 --> 5164.4400000000005
allowed

5160.96 --> 5168.34
to just be a whatever

5164.44 --> 5171.599999999999
a sidestepper a scab perhaps you could

5168.34 --> 5174.88
call it like with uh

5171.6 --> 5177.52
protesting situations and labor

5174.88 --> 5179.92
like you will not do that or you will

5177.52 --> 5182.8
literally be ostracized by The Wider

5179.92 --> 5186.28
Community like you will be marked as you

5182.8 --> 5189.46
are a corrupter you are part of that

5186.28 --> 5192.699
prepare for poverty and just like people

5189.46 --> 5195.46
not helping you anymore and hating you

5192.699 --> 5197.739
like you will not cooperate with the

5195.46 --> 5199.54
mega corporations that are satanists you

5197.739 --> 5201.94
will not do it

5199.54 --> 5205.78
you will step out

5201.94 --> 5210.04
and you will reject anything they do

5205.78 --> 5211.12
that will basically be evil

5210.04 --> 5214.9
right

5211.12 --> 5217.179
do not abuse opportunities that come on

5214.9 --> 5219.339999999999
top of that right because every time

5217.179 --> 5221.56
some satanic bastard

5219.34 --> 5224.38
goes ballistic does something [ __ ] up

5221.56 --> 5226.179
it's always gravel time always everybody

5224.38 --> 5229.2390000000005
starts swarming around it's like oh

5226.179 --> 5231.46
there's people going getting destroyed

5229.239 --> 5233.86
their runes lives are getting ruined oh

5231.46 --> 5235.84
we can make money off that

5233.86 --> 5238.9
and that's how it all goes around

5235.84 --> 5242.639
because that remains possible because

5238.9 --> 5244.9
people can make money of satanists

5242.639 --> 5248.92
destroying the world

5244.9 --> 5249.65
because that is possible they win

5248.92 --> 5256.179
you see

5249.65 --> 5258.96
[Music]

5256.179 --> 5261.66
they win because our freedom to corrupt

5258.96 --> 5263.5
freedom to corrupt makes them win

5261.66 --> 5266.26
[Music]

5263.5 --> 5268.3
because they can always find a new

5266.26 --> 5270.04
victim that's going to be stripped and

5268.3 --> 5271.62
exploited and everybody can have their

5270.04 --> 5274.719
way with them

5271.62 --> 5277.48
every single time every moment every

5274.719 --> 5279.55
year the rest of their lives

5277.48 --> 5283.36
that's what they do

5279.55 --> 5284.860000000001
[Music]

5283.36 --> 5286.599999999999
yeah but then you follow people we know

5284.86 --> 5287.739
whether it be Health people or flower of

5286.6 --> 5290.1990000000005
people and they'll release something

5287.739 --> 5292.178999999999
maybe a book and that will be available

5290.199 --> 5294.28
on Amazon

5292.179 --> 5297.219
which I find interesting

5294.28 --> 5299.44
well then don't buy it

5297.219 --> 5301.659
I'm not buying it

5299.44 --> 5303.759999999999
I'm not buying anything from Amazon I've

5301.659 --> 5306.219
never bought anything from Amazon I will

5303.76 --> 5307.659000000001
never buy anything from Amazon no matter

5306.219 --> 5310.179
what

5307.659 --> 5313.179
no matter if like that's the only place

5310.179 --> 5315.52
you can get a certain thing good then

5313.179 --> 5318.4
let it die

5315.52 --> 5320.820000000001
they will not get my business no matter

5318.4 --> 5320.82
what

5321.58 --> 5324.46
yeah them people say to me and said why

5323.26 --> 5326.1990000000005
wouldn't you xam and they're just so

5324.46 --> 5327.639
great like I can get groceries delivered

5326.199 --> 5329.799999999999
in 15 minutes because they live near

5327.639 --> 5330.88
London or in American city but then I

5329.8 --> 5332.62
just say to them yeah they're great now

5330.88 --> 5335.38
but wait until they're the only company

5332.62 --> 5336.82
then see how they treat you they'll be

5335.38 --> 5339.82
like the Umbrella Corporation from

5336.82 --> 5342.04
Resident Evil worse will soon be like

5339.82 --> 5345.599999999999
that dude if they could they would

5342.04 --> 5345.6
literally just steal money

5345.699 --> 5350.379999999999
right I would say I mean if they get

5348.58 --> 5353.32
that kind of power you have situations

5350.38 --> 5355.36
where you will order things and then you

5353.32 --> 5357.699
will just not receive it

5355.36 --> 5360.4
you will have paid it to them and then

5357.699 --> 5362.5
you will just not get the product

5360.4 --> 5365.138999999999
and then there will be nothing you can

5362.5 --> 5366.76
do about it's just like thanks thanks

5365.139 --> 5368.32
for giving me that money oh you thought

5366.76 --> 5369.88
you were buying so yeah thanks you just

5368.32 --> 5371.44
gave it to me what are you gonna do

5369.88 --> 5372.82
about it huh what are you gonna do about

5371.44 --> 5375.219
it nothing

5372.82 --> 5377.92
just mope and complain about it don't

5375.219 --> 5381.88
get too cocky or send her a judge or

5377.92 --> 5384.34
drudges against you our private Army

5381.88 --> 5386.56
that's what will happen eventually

5384.34 --> 5389.08
with companies like this they will just

5386.56 --> 5391.92
rob you and there will be nothing that

5389.08 --> 5391.92
will be done about it

5394.18 --> 5397.900000000001
[Music]

5395.86 --> 5399.4
that's why some people are so Keen about

5397.9 --> 5402.339999999999
crypto even though I don't understand

5399.4 --> 5404.199
how it works it's because it takes Banks

5402.34 --> 5406.0
and PayPal and people like out totally

5404.199 --> 5409.78
out of the equation no it doesn't in

5406.0 --> 5412.26
interactions between you and this server

5409.78 --> 5412.259999999999
you know

5412.3 --> 5417.76
no it doesn't

5414.06 --> 5421.42
cryptocurrency is the most in control

5417.76 --> 5424.659000000001
of the banking Elite of any Financial

5421.42 --> 5426.9400000000005
system that has ever existed thus far

5424.659 --> 5429.04
if it's fully under control

5426.94 --> 5431.138999999999
I mean we're talking we're talking about

5429.04 --> 5433.3
something that is electronically

5431.139 --> 5435.82
dependent

5433.3 --> 5438.28
fully

5435.82 --> 5440.44
yeah guess who's in control of

5438.28 --> 5443.679
electronics

5440.44 --> 5448.419999999999
and of electricity supplies and

5443.679 --> 5451.42
everything yeah no no

5448.42 --> 5454.3
turning to digital currency over well

5451.42 --> 5457.42
the fiat currency and gold and silver

5454.3 --> 5460.02
is literally taking our last chip we had

5457.42 --> 5460.02
against them

5460.239 --> 5465.94
because when it's digital like you think

5463.6 --> 5468.76
you're free with it but

5465.94 --> 5471.5199999999995
like if you just you can trade it but if

5468.76 --> 5473.679
nobody's gonna cash it in if nobody will

5471.52 --> 5475.780000000001
like just be like yeah or I'll trade

5473.679 --> 5479.86
that for like two Bitcoins and then it's

5475.78 --> 5483.5199999999995
like okay deal I I get the Bitcoin

5479.86 --> 5485.799999999999
then you try to cash it in right and

5483.52 --> 5488.38
then it's like oh oh yeah there's a

5485.8 --> 5491.38
little history detail on there because

5488.38 --> 5494.56
the history is all recorded and it and

5491.38 --> 5496.78
all that and yeah it seems like this was

5494.56 --> 5500.860000000001
owned by somebody that's on The

5496.78 --> 5501.94
Blacklist of the banks so it's nullified

5500.86 --> 5504.639
now

5501.94 --> 5508.419999999999
yeah you don't get to cash it in yeah

5504.639 --> 5511.4400000000005
that's what's going to happen

5508.42 --> 5514.36
you understand it will be the most

5511.44 --> 5516.159
restricted form of payment that you

5514.36 --> 5519.639
could ever imagine because they can

5516.159 --> 5520.96
literally flick it off with a switch at

5519.639 --> 5523.659000000001
a distance yeah

5520.96 --> 5526.0
mean paper you can burn that and it's

5523.659 --> 5530.98
gone yeah they can add a distance to

5526.0 --> 5532.6
click and suddenly it it's evaporated it

5530.98 --> 5534.699
doesn't exist anymore and you wouldn't

5532.6 --> 5536.320000000001
even realize it until you try to cash it

5534.699 --> 5539.32
in

5536.32 --> 5541.599999999999
that's what I see is gonna happen

5539.32 --> 5543.88
with cryptocurrency

5541.6 --> 5546.46
it's also great so Anonymous now it's

5543.88 --> 5548.7390000000005
absolutely the least Anonymous form of

5546.46 --> 5550.84
payment that has ever existed everything

5548.739 --> 5553.48
is recorded in that [ __ ]

5550.84 --> 5556.719
because it is a history profile with

5553.48 --> 5559.959999999999
every crypto coin

5556.719 --> 5562.78
or most of them anyway

5559.96 --> 5563.92
yeah some are private Bitcoin is the

5562.78 --> 5565.48
main one that's open but that was

5563.92 --> 5568.42
designed to be open but if it's a

5565.48 --> 5570.339999999999
private coin then it's it you know what

5568.42 --> 5573.58
that is right that's basically like

5570.34 --> 5575.38
chips at a casino that's it it's like

5573.58 --> 5576.4
yeah that's their chips they use it for

5575.38 --> 5579.219
them

5576.4 --> 5581.5599999999995
but it's literally worth nothing

5579.219 --> 5584.86
yeah that's a private cryptocurrency

5581.56 --> 5587.92
it's literally just

5584.86 --> 5588.699
yeah like shells on a beach it's just a

5587.92 --> 5591.639
game

5588.699 --> 5593.799999999999
it's a set of rules it's within that and

5591.639 --> 5594.6990000000005
then yeah that's it it's not worth

5593.8 --> 5596.02
anything

5594.699 --> 5598.178999999999
it's just

5596.02 --> 5600.88
shells on a beach

5598.179 --> 5601.96
and playing cards fiat currency though

5600.88 --> 5605.139
isn't it it's just more people are

5601.96 --> 5607.2390000000005
willing to play the game right yeah

5605.139 --> 5610.679
but when you then want to cash it in so

5607.239 --> 5610.678999999999
you can actually buy things

5611.56 --> 5615.400000000001
yeah

5612.76 --> 5617.860000000001
If eventually there will be like crypto

5615.4 --> 5619.599999999999
police and their secret service will be

5617.86 --> 5621.82
on top of that and then there will just

5619.6 --> 5623.860000000001
be Mark since like yeah this crypto

5621.82 --> 5625.42
that you're trying to cash in has been

5623.86 --> 5628.239
marked as

5625.42 --> 5630.219
having been in possession of somebody

5628.239 --> 5632.379999999999
that's like

5630.219 --> 5633.699
a terrorist or something right and this

5632.38 --> 5635.92
could even be like politically

5633.699 --> 5638.199
designated so they could just like bully

5635.92 --> 5641.1990000000005
people like that

5638.199 --> 5643.299999999999
and then you just can't cash it

5641.199 --> 5644.919999999999
so you just lost something in a trade

5643.3 --> 5647.4400000000005
you got this crypto and then you can't

5644.92 --> 5650.32
cash it like ever ever again it's

5647.44 --> 5651.5199999999995
literally been blacklisted that piece of

5650.32 --> 5653.32
crypto

5651.52 --> 5656.080000000001
that [ __ ] can happen

5653.32 --> 5657.639
yeah how do you do that with cash you

5656.08 --> 5660.28
don't you can't do it you have to

5657.639 --> 5661.36
physically find it take it away Burn It

5660.28 --> 5663.759999999999
Whatever

5661.36 --> 5665.94
with the crypto they will be able to do

5663.76 --> 5665.9400000000005
that

5666.94 --> 5671.919999999999
so yes for connecting sorry for the doom

5670.36 --> 5673.9
and glue

5671.92 --> 5675.76
we created our own system where we only

5673.9 --> 5678.04
traded with each other then we'd never

5675.76 --> 5680.1990000000005
reject right or a certain type of

5678.04 --> 5683.0199999999995
account right but that's just but but

5680.199 --> 5684.82
that's just barter that's just chips in

5683.02 --> 5687.159000000001
a casino they're only worth something

5684.82 --> 5689.739
within the casino right you take those

5687.159 --> 5692.739
chips from the casino you go

5689.739 --> 5696.459999999999
to some other place it's like yeah

5692.739 --> 5699.638999999999
that's that's like worth three cents

5696.46 --> 5701.92
like that's not cash like we are not

5699.639 --> 5703.36
going to be able to pay with that right

5701.92 --> 5705.34
so

5703.36 --> 5707.139
yeah of course you can have a barter

5705.34 --> 5710.38
system and then use your own private

5707.139 --> 5712.84
crypto to manage that barter system but

5710.38 --> 5715.84
that barter system will only work as

5712.84 --> 5718.12
long as there is agreement upon it so

5715.84 --> 5721.0
you have to have a group of Traders and

5718.12 --> 5722.92
like Farmers whatever trading eggs milk

5721.0 --> 5725.739
all that

5722.92 --> 5727.86
services and then you can have your

5725.739 --> 5730.599999999999
private crypto

5727.86 --> 5732.639
barter system right that's not a

5730.6 --> 5735.34
currency that's not legal tender that's

5732.639 --> 5737.26
an agreement-based system

5735.34 --> 5739.84
so yeah sure you could do that crypto

5737.26 --> 5743.6990000000005
but that's not really money

5739.84 --> 5743.6990000000005
see that's an agreement system

5744.639 --> 5750.3
I why the [ __ ] do I know so much about

5747.94 --> 5750.299999999999
this

5752.02 --> 5756.400000000001
I really like about the amount of people

5754.06 --> 5759.159000000001
though isn't it it goes from being just

5756.4 --> 5760.659
a private key a private coin to a actual

5759.159 --> 5762.159
currency once you get enough people on

5760.659 --> 5763.9
board once you get like a million people

5762.159 --> 5765.28
then it's real

5763.9 --> 5767.5599999999995
so

5765.28 --> 5770.139
you know it only works with with

5767.56 --> 5773.320000000001
convention doesn't it with

5770.139 --> 5774.82
enough people on board but I'm surprised

5773.32 --> 5777.78
someone like Amazon doesn't pay their

5774.82 --> 5779.799999999999
staff in Amazon tokens only because

5777.78 --> 5781.42
shipbuilders used to do that and cotton

5779.8 --> 5784.06
Mills used to have tokens that you could

5781.42 --> 5785.679
only spend on the land of the um meal

5784.06 --> 5787.6
owner and you had to buy all your

5785.679 --> 5790.12
necessaries your clothes and groceries

5787.6 --> 5792.58
well they will probably they already do

5790.12 --> 5794.86
that they just don't do it exclusively

5792.58 --> 5796.659
right they just incentivize that but

5794.86 --> 5798.759999999999
they have their own Amazon thingies

5796.659 --> 5800.379999999999
their own Amazon credit and all that and

5798.76 --> 5802.3
you get discounts on everything in

5800.38 --> 5804.639
Amazon etc etc

5802.3 --> 5807.76
so it's called a company store by the

5804.639 --> 5809.08
way that system The Company Store make

5807.76 --> 5812.1990000000005
you work there

5809.08 --> 5814.679
and then you what you make you can

5812.199 --> 5818.739
partially or or

5814.679 --> 5821.4400000000005
exclusively only use that that gaining

5818.739 --> 5822.638999999999
on the store of what they have

5821.44 --> 5825.95
right

5822.639 --> 5828.52
but that is basically a form of slavery

5825.95 --> 5832.0599999999995
[Music]

5828.52 --> 5835.120000000001
yes because if you did that then you

5832.06 --> 5838.06
cannot mark up your workers as actually

5835.12 --> 5840.4
being workers because you're not giving

5838.06 --> 5844.6
them legal tender

5840.4 --> 5846.4
see that works with slavery

5844.6 --> 5850.06
and it doesn't really work in a modern

5846.4 --> 5853.599999999999
society where slavery is outlawed

5850.06 --> 5855.76
right but they can make you trade your

5853.6 --> 5858.219
income which will be very little so

5855.76 --> 5860.320000000001
actual legal tender income for their

5858.219 --> 5862.78
special tokens under the prompts oh you

5860.32 --> 5865.36
can get so much more if you just

5862.78 --> 5866.5
take it all through Amazon coin or

5865.36 --> 5868.659
whatever

5866.5 --> 5870.88
and sure that they're gonna I'm sure

5868.659 --> 5873.96
they're doing that right now

5870.88 --> 5873.96
I mean why not

5879.159 --> 5881.679
yeah they're just going to make things a

5880.54 --> 5883.54
bit more difficult aren't they because

5881.679 --> 5885.58
like at the moment I'm managing to get

5883.54 --> 5887.739
by without having any photographic idea

5885.58 --> 5891.219
ID but a lot of people will require it

5887.739 --> 5892.659
so I can't do business with some people

5891.219 --> 5893.8
but it's just going to keep creeping

5892.659 --> 5895.96
like that isn't it it's going to become

5893.8 --> 5898.12
digital ID from now on

5895.96 --> 5899.32
they're gonna request

5898.12 --> 5901.239
and then they're going to start big

5899.32 --> 5902.739
companies will require at some point so

5901.239 --> 5905.259999999999
you won't be able to go on Amazon unless

5902.739 --> 5907.419999999999
you have a digital ID and hopefully they

5905.26 --> 5910.06
will lose business when they try that

5907.42 --> 5911.7390000000005
and then they'll have to stop it because

5910.06 --> 5913.659000000001
these things they like fly kites don't

5911.739 --> 5915.638999999999
they they see what works if people agree

5913.659 --> 5917.5
to it they they roll with it if not then

5915.639 --> 5919.06
they try something else maybe after a

5917.5 --> 5922.78
little break

5919.06 --> 5925.4800000000005
with this U.N agenda 20 early stuff look

5922.78 --> 5928.659
if you're gonna have to have ID just to

5925.48 --> 5932.919999999999
buy that's not gonna go well but if you

5928.659 --> 5936.04
have to have like fair I idea to be a

5932.92 --> 5938.56
seller I mean that's only fair enough

5936.04 --> 5940.48
isn't it

5938.56 --> 5942.52
in general

5940.48 --> 5944.638999999999
I'm going to talk about some covet past

5942.52 --> 5946.900000000001
nonsense but just a regular

5944.639 --> 5949.0
identification I mean if you're going to

5946.9 --> 5950.739
be a seller somewhere

5949.0 --> 5952.78
on Amazon

5950.739 --> 5954.638999999999
shouldn't you have like a proper

5952.78 --> 5956.5599999999995
identification I mean

5954.639 --> 5958.96
you're selling

5956.56 --> 5961.120000000001
right oh yes but then who determines

5958.96 --> 5962.26
whether I'm a real honest teller or not

5961.12 --> 5963.94
the government

5962.26 --> 5967.719
do you trust them no but that's not

5963.94 --> 5969.94
about that it's about that if you're not

5967.719 --> 5973.4800000000005
a trustworthy seller

5969.94 --> 5975.28
then that will be directly marked on

5973.48 --> 5979.12
your identity

5975.28 --> 5981.4
so if you are a scammer then you will be

5979.12 --> 5984.239
marked as a scammer

5981.4 --> 5984.239
with your ID

5984.639 --> 5988.36
right yeah that's how they bring these

5986.86 --> 5990.94
control systems in with that thought

5988.36 --> 5993.159
it's a genuine thought but it just

5990.94 --> 5997.259999999999
brings in control Power which they don't

5993.159 --> 5997.259999999999
deserve and definitely don't have

5999.58 --> 6002.34
just like say take passport driving

6001.26 --> 6004.5
license

6002.34 --> 6006.3
I mean why have those

6004.5 --> 6008.219
there aren't any less accidents than it

6006.3 --> 6009.659000000001
used to be there's just aware control on

6008.219 --> 6011.4
people so they can stop you on the road

6009.659 --> 6013.799999999999
and ask you to get out and search your

6011.4 --> 6014.638999999999
car because you've agreed to be in that

6013.8 --> 6017.04
system

6014.639 --> 6018.78
they like that sort of stuff but they

6017.04 --> 6020.5199999999995
don't actually have the power to do it

6018.78 --> 6022.0199999999995
but when it comes down to it of course

6020.52 --> 6023.159000000001
they do because they have the police

6022.02 --> 6025.56
don't they

6023.159 --> 6027.48
but at least in their own law system

6025.56 --> 6029.88
they don't actually have the power to do

6027.48 --> 6032.659
it but they still do it anyway because

6029.88 --> 6032.659000000001
they're criminals

6038.699 --> 6043.799999999999
that's why when you you take an American

6040.32 --> 6045.9
city that has no guns by law they have

6043.8 --> 6047.820000000001
more gun violence because criminals

6045.9 --> 6049.799999999999
don't care about laws so all the honest

6047.82 --> 6051.0599999999995
people aren't protected but all the

6049.8 --> 6052.4400000000005
criminals are running around with guns

6051.06 --> 6054.900000000001
so the only people with guns are the

6052.44 --> 6056.94
police and the criminals so that's why

6054.9 --> 6058.379999999999
it gets worse yeah and I think that

6056.94 --> 6060.36
works out across the board doesn't it

6058.38 --> 6062.34
the more place places that have loads of

6060.36 --> 6064.32
guns especially open carry have

6062.34 --> 6066.900000000001
virtually zero gun violence right

6064.32 --> 6069.96
because the actual application of guns

6066.9 --> 6071.82
will then be too high risk to make it

6069.96 --> 6074.28
worth it

6071.82 --> 6076.139
right I mean take the American

6074.28 --> 6077.88
conventions known as the Constitutions

6076.139 --> 6080.82
and Trust in other trust and Dentures

6077.88 --> 6084.4800000000005
they're supposed to be on clad but

6080.82 --> 6086.699
there's all these gun rules in America

6084.48 --> 6090.299999999999
yeah but they're not actually lost

6086.699 --> 6092.9
though not actually

6090.3 --> 6095.1
no they're policies they're just stupid

6092.9 --> 6098.299999999999
they're just stupid mind control

6095.1 --> 6098.3
policies so

6098.4 --> 6101.82
right they're just and that's the

6100.08 --> 6104.76
problem is that

6101.82 --> 6108.239
maybe worse than everywhere else in the

6104.76 --> 6110.219
world Americans are so easily convinced

6108.239 --> 6112.619
they're so easily herded into doing

6110.219 --> 6114.54
something stupid

6112.619 --> 6116.639
I mean really

6114.54 --> 6119.34
Europe is not that great with it either

6116.639 --> 6122.400000000001
I mean we have our problems like that

6119.34 --> 6125.46
especially Germany but Americans are

6122.4 --> 6127.199
just like you just have to be some

6125.46 --> 6130.92
stupid media person or a government

6127.199 --> 6132.9
person tell people what to do and just

6130.92 --> 6135.92
so many Americans will actually do it

6132.9 --> 6135.92
it's unbelievable

6137.94 --> 6140.82
yeah but you imagine that anyone who's

6139.619 --> 6142.679
read the Constitution the Second

6140.82 --> 6144.9
Amendment the right to bear arms to form

6142.679 --> 6146.6990000000005
a militia that would be against a

6144.9 --> 6149.159
corrupt Authority known as a government

6146.699 --> 6150.599999999999
but then you you have to register your

6149.159 --> 6152.638999999999
firearm with the government so they know

6150.6 --> 6154.860000000001
how many guns people have got do people

6152.639 --> 6157.02
not think about these things

6154.86 --> 6159.599999999999
that can't possibly be constitutional

6157.02 --> 6162.0
yet no but you don't have to find to

6159.6 --> 6163.9800000000005
have a serial number on your gun

6162.0 --> 6166.08
yeah but constitutionally you don't have

6163.98 --> 6167.4
to register your gun

6166.08 --> 6171.179
but

6167.4 --> 6174.299999999999
that's usually like state law and [ __ ]

6171.179 --> 6175.679
right it's policy it's another type of

6174.3 --> 6177.6
law it's just

6175.679 --> 6180.0
America is a little complicated like

6177.6 --> 6182.159000000001
that right you have national law you

6180.0 --> 6184.639
have state law and then if you county

6182.159 --> 6187.619
law and

6184.639 --> 6190.8
well actually the state constitutions

6187.619 --> 6191.46
brings people a few more rights really

6190.8 --> 6193.139
um

6191.46 --> 6194.52
if you look at them a lot of them like

6193.139 --> 6196.1990000000005
the Virginia Constitution says something

6194.52 --> 6199.139
about like the government is formed to

6196.199 --> 6201.299999999999
make people's lives more enjoyable they

6199.139 --> 6202.679
use that sort of language which is the

6201.3 --> 6204.78
whole idea of a government was to

6202.679 --> 6207.0
administer to govern to make things

6204.78 --> 6209.82
better to make life Peaceable and

6207.0 --> 6212.1
enjoyable and easier to but governments

6209.82 --> 6214.32
don't do that though do they they don't

6212.1 --> 6216.96
make life more enjoyable for you well

6214.32 --> 6219.54
they should but the problem is is that a

6216.96 --> 6222.659
corporate model is taking over

6219.54 --> 6224.639
and corporations are there to exploit

6222.659 --> 6226.679
and not really to

6224.639 --> 6230.46
make life easier for people right

6226.679 --> 6233.6990000000005
because if people have an easy life then

6230.46 --> 6235.5
they cannot be as exploited as easily

6233.699 --> 6238.32
and that's the problem that's also by

6235.5 --> 6240.119
the way fascist because it is basically

6238.32 --> 6242.34
the government conspiring with

6240.119 --> 6244.259999999999
corporations and what they want is

6242.34 --> 6247.32
government conspiring with the zombie

6244.26 --> 6248.280000000001
corporations to literally strip the

6247.32 --> 6250.679
people

6248.28 --> 6252.659
of their defense so the zombies can just

6250.679 --> 6255.179
swallow them

6252.659 --> 6256.699
right it's a form of like

6255.179 --> 6260.34
yeah

6256.699 --> 6263.759999999999
exploitative fascism

6260.34 --> 6265.8
and it comes from a corporatization it

6263.76 --> 6268.02
comes from a corporatist attitude within

6265.8 --> 6270.84
government

6268.02 --> 6273.2390000000005
that they prioritize welfare of

6270.84 --> 6275.159000000001
companies and company business doing

6273.239 --> 6278.718999999999
well over

6275.159 --> 6282.179
just this sanity cultural cohesion

6278.719 --> 6284.46
morality of the people

6282.179 --> 6286.02
it is corporatocracy by the way it's not

6284.46 --> 6288.42
really fascism it's really more

6286.02 --> 6291.360000000001
corporatocracy because

6288.42 --> 6293.76
yeah fascism

6291.36 --> 6295.199
still has some other traits to it as

6293.76 --> 6298.58
well

6295.199 --> 6298.58
so then they're more elaborate

6299.58 --> 6303.239
it's an interesting conversation by the

6301.199 --> 6306.199
way we've been going for

6303.239 --> 6306.199
quite some time

6308.4 --> 6311.339999999999
yeah I just find it interesting how

6310.08 --> 6313.26
they've managed to pull this off really

6311.34 --> 6314.52
because it's like um most countries

6313.26 --> 6316.860000000001
although I know Netherlands are

6314.52 --> 6319.080000000001
different you have two parties and they

6316.86 --> 6322.32
fund both of them so no matter who wins

6319.08 --> 6324.659
they get their people in and they're all

6322.32 --> 6326.34
and the people who they talk to they're

6324.659 --> 6327.599999999999
hit people at Banks and stuff they've

6326.34 --> 6329.52
all gone to school with these top

6327.6 --> 6331.5
politicians so they're all friends of

6329.52 --> 6333.4800000000005
them they have you know lunches with

6331.5 --> 6335.4
them every every day right sometimes

6333.48 --> 6336.9
these people so they don't even need to

6335.4 --> 6338.638999999999
have control of politicians although

6336.9 --> 6341.04
they do seem to have control of certain

6338.639 --> 6342.659000000001
people with videotape evidence that sort

6341.04 --> 6344.04
of stuff but they can just be friends

6342.659 --> 6346.259999999999
with them and they can just pitch these

6344.04 --> 6347.94
ideas and sell it to them and by the

6346.26 --> 6350.1
time it gets down to

6347.94 --> 6352.259999999999
civil servants actually putting the laws

6350.1 --> 6354.179
into place if you actually look at laws

6352.26 --> 6355.8
they don't actually say anything like

6354.179 --> 6357.179
what the government says they say if you

6355.8 --> 6359.159000000001
actually look at the text of laws

6357.179 --> 6360.0
they're so vague they could mean

6359.159 --> 6362.099999999999
anything

6360.0 --> 6364.38
see when they say like in my country in

6362.1 --> 6366.06
England you have to have a photo ID to

6364.38 --> 6368.28
transact with a bank or for them to

6366.06 --> 6369.0
verify your identity that's not in the

6368.28 --> 6370.5599999999995
law

6369.0 --> 6372.06
never going to be in the law because

6370.56 --> 6374.84
they can't require it because it would

6372.06 --> 6377.820000000001
break a previous law that's on the books

6374.84 --> 6379.4400000000005
so they just a suggestion all these

6377.82 --> 6382.98
things like you say are they're like

6379.44 --> 6385.799999999999
mandates so that's corporatism because

6382.98 --> 6388.379999999999
they get their big corporate friends to

6385.8 --> 6390.900000000001
impose all this stuff on people Drip by

6388.38 --> 6393.179
drip step by step right the corporation

6390.9 --> 6395.5199999999995
stick the corporations take over

6393.179 --> 6397.86
people's lives and the governments allow

6395.52 --> 6399.719
it to happen

6397.86 --> 6402.839999999999
and basically

6399.719 --> 6404.699
phase try to work with the unrest and

6402.84 --> 6405.01
settle it down but they're not stopping

6404.699 --> 6408.228999999999
it

6405.01 --> 6408.229
[Music]

6408.84 --> 6411.96
I mean that's the main reason why I try

6410.34 --> 6413.9400000000005
and deal with independent people well

6411.96 --> 6416.46
one because I do it myself I'm

6413.94 --> 6418.44
self-employed businessman and also it's

6416.46 --> 6421.02
not that they need the money Amazon

6418.44 --> 6423.239
it's got the people who own Amazon print

6421.02 --> 6424.7390000000005
their own money so that it's that your

6423.239 --> 6426.599999999999
money could go to someone else who could

6424.739 --> 6429.419999999999
actually use it

6426.6 --> 6431.280000000001
and make an alternative economy

6429.42 --> 6433.08
four of us all to live in and if we

6431.28 --> 6435.48
don't support the things you love then

6433.08 --> 6437.76
they disappeared right right it's like

6435.48 --> 6440.339999999999
this by the way ten dollars well I've

6437.76 --> 6441.659000000001
got a new conception and it's kind of

6440.34 --> 6447.54
weird though

6441.659 --> 6449.759999999999
but remember how to say like Buy Local

6447.54 --> 6451.44
right you know that saying right Buy

6449.76 --> 6454.5
Local that's basically what we're

6451.44 --> 6456.54
describing here like don't buy from the

6454.5 --> 6458.46
big corporations to get a little bit of

6456.54 --> 6460.619
profit you have to buy local or it'll go

6458.46 --> 6463.32
away well

6460.619 --> 6466.679
what if it just said like Buy Local

6463.32 --> 6469.5599999999995
everywhere so that means just don't buy

6466.679 --> 6470.9400000000005
from Big corporations buy from

6469.56 --> 6472.9800000000005
like

6470.94 --> 6474.599999999999
small businessmen

6472.98 --> 6477.0
that it's just doing a very simple

6474.6 --> 6479.219
business and focusing on that

6477.0 --> 6480.36
and then buy from them like I like to

6479.219 --> 6485.82
buy

6480.36 --> 6487.739
raw tobacco from yeah a tobacco farmer

6485.82 --> 6490.5
in America

6487.739 --> 6493.259999999999
like it's a corporation but it's

6490.5 --> 6495.239
probably pretty big farmer but like I

6493.26 --> 6498.2390000000005
know that's it's just that it's just

6495.239 --> 6500.879999999999
doing that right and it's no stupid

6498.239 --> 6502.5
interest in all these not trying to plan

6500.88 --> 6505.139
anything to do with it he's not trying

6502.5 --> 6508.199
to create a new

6505.139 --> 6510.06
uh tobacco Mega Corporation he's just

6508.199 --> 6512.099999999999
doing that he's just farming that now

6510.06 --> 6514.619000000001
that's also local it's not local right

6512.1 --> 6517.92
here in the Netherlands but it's local

6514.619 --> 6520.0199999999995
way over there in the United States

6517.92 --> 6523.139
and and that's what I like to do I like

6520.02 --> 6526.280000000001
to buy local everywhere buy a local

6523.139 --> 6526.28
around the world

6527.58 --> 6531.3
yeah yeah I agree and if you do that

6529.5 --> 6533.76
very good then it's like the mega

6531.3 --> 6537.06
corporations will just see their easy

6533.76 --> 6541.280000000001
quick money just slip away

6537.06 --> 6541.280000000001
while the little guys get reinforced

6543.54 --> 6547.56
yeah I mean the cash that they actually

6545.4 --> 6549.96
generate from their businesses seems to

6547.56 --> 6551.76
go to their minions you know the actual

6549.96 --> 6553.26
puppets because they enjoy the money

6551.76 --> 6554.9400000000005
they obviously want to have the boats

6553.26 --> 6557.34
and the fast cars and that sort of stuff

6554.94 --> 6559.86
but the real people behind this who own

6557.34 --> 6561.659000000001
the banks they can print their own money

6559.86 --> 6563.639
I mean they just swap their debt for

6561.659 --> 6565.0199999999995
Reserve currency and then they've got

6563.639 --> 6566.159000000001
any amount of money they want and that's

6565.02 --> 6568.38
how they've got control because they've

6566.159 --> 6571.679
managed to buy huge waves of mineral

6568.38 --> 6573.96
rights and land with this fake money and

6571.679 --> 6575.9400000000005
then they just use it to carry on so

6573.96 --> 6578.28
you've got people like Bill Gates buying

6575.94 --> 6580.08
up farmland and stuff because you can

6578.28 --> 6581.5199999999995
because his backers want him to have

6580.08 --> 6583.86
that much because he's like one of their

6581.52 --> 6585.540000000001
totems in it to focus on all your anger

6583.86 --> 6588.739
on and then they'll just do away with

6585.54 --> 6588.739
him when he's no long kissable

6589.44 --> 6593.879999999999
yeah it's a mess when things get when

6591.659 --> 6596.719
corporations get that big

6593.88 --> 6596.719
it yeah

6596.82 --> 6600.719
the um one of the spacebusters videos

6598.98 --> 6602.82
they did something about Bill Gates they

6600.719 --> 6604.679
said he's somehow related to the

6602.82 --> 6606.78
Rothschilds on both sides of his family

6604.679 --> 6609.0
from his mother and his father

6606.78 --> 6611.04
wouldn't surprise me but

6609.0 --> 6612.6
you know how people like to link all of

6611.04 --> 6615.42
the president's families together how

6612.6 --> 6616.92
they're all sort of cousins or distant

6615.42 --> 6618.96
cousins a bit like royal families like

6616.92 --> 6619.97
you could say they're just like a new

6618.96 --> 6621.719
version of that

6619.97 --> 6623.030000000001
[Music]

6621.719 --> 6626.22
for their adult people

6623.03 --> 6626.219999999999
[Music]

6627.96 --> 6631.219
putting you in the title

6632.1 --> 6636.4800000000005
but a bit like Einstein I can't remember

6634.38 --> 6637.92
which way around it was but he he had a

6636.48 --> 6640.259999999999
first wife and he divorced her and his

6637.92 --> 6642.179
second wife was his second cousin on his

6640.26 --> 6643.92
mother's side but his first cousin on

6642.179 --> 6646.4400000000005
his father's side so he did marry his

6643.92 --> 6648.54
second cousin so the E equals MC squared

6646.44 --> 6650.28
does work with the with you know

6648.54 --> 6652.199
reflective curvature's joke

6650.28 --> 6654.54
he married his cousin twice yeah he

6652.199 --> 6657.54
married his second cup I know so still

6654.54 --> 6659.82
work but that's that's a very incestuous

6657.54 --> 6662.219
sort of relationship isn't it being a

6659.82 --> 6664.08
different cousin with someone twice from

6662.219 --> 6665.88
both sides of your family that's like a

6664.08 --> 6668.34
Rothschild sort of

6665.88 --> 6671.78
banking cartel sort of set up isn't it

6668.34 --> 6673.9800000000005
right with Einstein well let's just re

6671.78 --> 6675.96
reformulate it it's kind of

6673.98 --> 6677.699
old-fashioned

6675.96 --> 6682.139
I mean

6677.699 --> 6684.719
really like let's say 200 years ago I

6682.139 --> 6687.42
think that it wasn't really all that

6684.719 --> 6689.6
big a deal I think that more people did

6687.42 --> 6692.88
that actually

6689.6 --> 6697.139
but yeah to do that in the 20th century

6692.88 --> 6701.0
is a bit weird and very grapply so

6697.139 --> 6701.0
and he was obviously a pervert

6707.219 --> 6711.3
yes but she must have been that his

6709.26 --> 6712.860000000001
second cousin once removed on one side

6711.3 --> 6714.659000000001
and then his first cousin on the other

6712.86 --> 6716.82
side of his family

6714.659 --> 6719.78
a bit weird he's a bit weird definitely

6716.82 --> 6719.78
first cousins anyway

6721.56 --> 6727.1
right well he's just really into his own

6724.38 --> 6727.1
family I guess

6729.119 --> 6735.0599999999995
but yeah that that particular formula so

6732.84 --> 6736.679
that's refractive just joking that the

6735.06 --> 6738.2390000000005
formula for general relativity is

6736.679 --> 6740.6990000000005
special relativity because it involves

6738.239 --> 6745.218999999999
marrying his cousin and that is special

6740.699 --> 6748.678999999999
relativity isn't it special relatives

6745.219 --> 6750.36
yeah it's hilarious I I really think

6748.679 --> 6754.139
that

6750.36 --> 6757.86
the E equals m c squared was actually a

6754.139 --> 6760.92
mock formula I think that it it was a

6757.86 --> 6763.94
gravel it's like let's bring up the

6760.92 --> 6766.9800000000005
ultimate idea that's gonna be like the

6763.94 --> 6769.5
Anchor Point for people to reflect on

6766.98 --> 6772.0199999999995
when they think of a brilliant idea E

6769.5 --> 6774.42
equals MC square I'll throw the papers

6772.02 --> 6779.34
right it's all so popular

6774.42 --> 6781.86
when it was always and exclusively just

6779.34 --> 6783.84
a trick to show you how incredibly

6781.86 --> 6786.48
[ __ ] everybody is

6783.84 --> 6788.400000000001
that's what I think about it I think it

6786.48 --> 6790.799999999999
it isn't anything it doesn't mean

6788.4 --> 6794.699
anything it makes no sense and it

6790.8 --> 6795.6
literally was theirs specifically to

6794.699 --> 6798.119
mean

6795.6 --> 6800.46
Einstein married his cousin twice I

6798.119 --> 6801.599999999999
really think it was I think that is what

6800.46 --> 6804.2390000000005
made it

6801.6 --> 6806.1
not actually the thing that supposedly

6804.239 --> 6808.919999999999
he figured out

6806.1 --> 6810.84
because it's [ __ ]

6808.92 --> 6813.119
it's just like Ness or not they make

6810.84 --> 6815.4800000000005
their videos terrible on purpose I think

6813.119 --> 6815.48
they do

6817.32 --> 6823.44
no but I I think it was specifically

6820.199 --> 6825.419999999999
grafted it was procured

6823.44 --> 6827.759999999999
as a gravel

6825.42 --> 6829.619
it's like okay this is going to be the

6827.76 --> 6831.84
most intelligent thing that you've ever

6829.619 --> 6834.299999999999
come up with Einstein and we're gonna

6831.84 --> 6837.360000000001
put it in the history book so it's gonna

6834.3 --> 6840.900000000001
be you married your cousins twice and

6837.36 --> 6842.4
say yeah that's gonna be in there and

6840.9 --> 6844.138999999999
you figure out how you're gonna explain

6842.4 --> 6846.78
I'm sure you figure out something that's

6844.139 --> 6849.3
going to blow everybody's mind

6846.78 --> 6851.28
the time me right I think that's what

6849.3 --> 6852.96
happened

6851.28 --> 6854.58
I don't think it was something he

6852.96 --> 6857.34
naturally came up with I think it was

6854.58 --> 6859.32
probably procured like you have to do

6857.34 --> 6860.76
this now we're gonna pay you you're

6859.32 --> 6862.799999999999
gonna come up with the smartest thing

6860.76 --> 6864.91
ever and it's gonna be the biggest joke

6862.8 --> 6867.54
ever

6864.91 --> 6870.659
[Music]

6867.54 --> 6872.82
and you have to do it

6870.659 --> 6874.44
of course

6872.82 --> 6876.9
I don't think Einstein would have been

6874.44 --> 6877.259999999999
given a choice to do that

6876.9 --> 6879.5599999999995
foreign

6877.26 --> 6882.119000000001
[Music]

6879.56 --> 6884.52
The Story Goes is that he was a patent

6882.119 --> 6885.9
Clerk and he wasn't very rich so maybe

6884.52 --> 6888.119000000001
someone just offered him loads of money

6885.9 --> 6891.48
in this formula and just said make it

6888.119 --> 6894.119
work now not just

6891.48 --> 6895.86
no but he was getting promoted first I

6894.119 --> 6900.42
mean I don't think like the E equals MC

6895.86 --> 6902.58
square was even his entry thing right

6900.42 --> 6905.52
it's something that it was supposedly

6902.58 --> 6906.3
the Capstone or the Rosetta Stone of his

6905.52 --> 6908.580000000001
work

6906.3 --> 6911.46
wasn't something he came up with at the

6908.58 --> 6913.679
beginning of this journey

6911.46 --> 6915.619
he was working with light he was trying

6913.679 --> 6919.6990000000005
to prove that light was a wave I think

6915.619 --> 6919.699
Einstein yeah yeah

6919.94 --> 6923.879999999999
[Music]

6921.3 --> 6926.78
he was trying all kinds of things but he

6923.88 --> 6926.78
wasn't very good at it

6930.0 --> 6935.58
someone saw potential in him somewhere

6932.34 --> 6937.9800000000005
whether it's the normal types but the

6935.58 --> 6940.739
funny thing the funny thing though about

6937.98 --> 6944.94
Einstein is he is he does have a

6940.739 --> 6949.32
function now historically because

6944.94 --> 6951.178999999999
you can literally measure somebody's wit

6949.32 --> 6953.699
how sharp they are and how much

6951.179 --> 6957.84
attention they pay how quick Reddit they

6953.699 --> 6961.799999999999
are buy what they think of Einstein

6957.84 --> 6963.900000000001
right because Einstein is like not that

6961.8 --> 6967.08
high a threshold

6963.9 --> 6969.0
of a gravel like you don't have to be an

6967.08 --> 6971.82
absolute genius to figure out that he's

6969.0 --> 6974.04
totally full of [ __ ] you just have to

6971.82 --> 6975.84
have some grasp

6974.04 --> 6977.76
you have to realize like hey wait May

6975.84 --> 6980.639
sue your remote in Force Base isn't

6977.76 --> 6984.360000000001
actually real it's a conceptual medium

6980.639 --> 6986.159000000001
right oh oh yeah you have to basically

6984.36 --> 6988.38
realize like oh it's all relative oh

6986.159 --> 6990.36
that's cute so how are you negating the

6988.38 --> 6992.76
forces that that things are being

6990.36 --> 6994.86
subjected to because those are still

6992.76 --> 6997.08
there oh wait so yeah it doesn't

6994.86 --> 6999.0599999999995
actually work at all these are the

6997.08 --> 7000.86
rudimentaries

6999.06 --> 7003.92
you'll just have to figure out to

7000.86 --> 7007.58
realize like Einstein is a pretend

7003.92 --> 7010.52
brilliant man and he is there to test

7007.58 --> 7013.34
you how smart you are so if somebody

7010.52 --> 7015.679
brings up Einstein like oh yeah Einstein

7013.34 --> 7016.76
is like it's the [ __ ] right he's so

7015.679 --> 7020.36
smart

7016.76 --> 7023.38
then you know he's a [ __ ] you

7020.36 --> 7023.38
immediately know

7024.26 --> 7029.780000000001
right you know it if someone's like oh

7027.08 --> 7033.32
Einstein man he's [ __ ] genius I'm

7029.78 --> 7035.9
you know they're stupid

7033.32 --> 7038.659
because they don't see it they don't

7035.9 --> 7041.36
understand that he's he's basically a

7038.659 --> 7044.0
a mock figure

7041.36 --> 7047.54
that's being put on a pedestal of being

7044.0 --> 7050.54
super brilliant when he obviously isn't

7047.54 --> 7053.239
so it's like an intelligence test

7050.54 --> 7055.699
do you think Einstein is all super smart

7053.239 --> 7060.159
and you're all in love with it and all

7055.699 --> 7060.159
that [ __ ] then you're a numpty

7062.719 --> 7067.28
yeah I mean they lose these um general

7065.239 --> 7069.138999999999
relativity for the flyoffs so you don't

7067.28 --> 7070.82
think the ground moving up at 9.81

7069.139 --> 7074.659000000001
meters per second per second God they

7070.82 --> 7076.159
lent that from Einstein yeah and they

7074.659 --> 7077.598999999999
say isn't Flat Earth stupid they believe

7076.159 --> 7079.46
the ground is moving up into the

7077.599 --> 7081.56
object's Future No that's Einstein

7079.46 --> 7083.179
that's what you believe numpy now but he

7081.56 --> 7085.52
didn't actually say that it's literally

7083.179 --> 7089.42
moving up it's all from within the

7085.52 --> 7091.46
relativity idea so it's like as if it is

7089.42 --> 7092.54
moving up he didn't actually literally

7091.46 --> 7094.34
say that

7092.54 --> 7096.32
and if he has he must have been like

7094.34 --> 7098.0
drunk off his ass or something at the

7096.32 --> 7100.639
time so

7098.0 --> 7102.38
yeah yeah it's the bending of a medium

7100.639 --> 7104.9800000000005
that doesn't exist yeah that's much more

7102.38 --> 7104.9800000000005
intelligible

7105.139 --> 7109.76
no but it's like when everything becomes

7107.42 --> 7112.4
relative motions and all that it doesn't

7109.76 --> 7114.56
matter anymore right there's no more

7112.4 --> 7117.759999999999
consequences of physical motion and

7114.56 --> 7120.02
acceleration right forces are basically

7117.76 --> 7122.84
being ignored

7120.02 --> 7123.92
within relativity they're just being

7122.84 --> 7126.8
ignored

7123.92 --> 7128.96
so Einstein was just like yeah oh what

7126.8 --> 7132.26
is gravity uh

7128.96 --> 7134.179
well think of it mathematically as if

7132.26 --> 7137.179
the Earth was accelerating up infinitely

7134.179 --> 7141.38
right so he's basically saying like

7137.179 --> 7144.02
think of gravity as an acceleration

7141.38 --> 7145.6990000000005
and how would that be it's something

7144.02 --> 7148.580000000001
that's nothing and it's accelerating

7145.699 --> 7150.799999999999
everything what well just imagine as if

7148.58 --> 7152.54
you were a thing that's accelerating

7150.8 --> 7154.88
upwards that's kind of what it's like

7152.54 --> 7157.219
that's basically what he said he didn't

7154.88 --> 7159.1990000000005
literally say oh the Earth is literally

7157.219 --> 7161.36
accelerating up that makes absolutely no

7159.199 --> 7163.36
sense it was purely a conceptual

7161.36 --> 7166.94
statement

7163.36 --> 7170.54
like imagine if this was the scenario

7166.94 --> 7173.0
well that's kind of what gravity is like

7170.54 --> 7176.44
and it was not even Einstein gravity it

7173.0 --> 7180.58
was just Newtonian so there's just

7176.44 --> 7180.58
Einstein was so all over the place

7186.5 --> 7190.119
I'm being really chatty

7191.0 --> 7196.159
no it's not very coherent is it Einstein

7194.3 --> 7197.54
that's why you know certain people on

7196.159 --> 7200.0599999999995
the panel have made a connection between

7197.54 --> 7201.92
that and the ether people because

7200.06 --> 7204.56
you're getting a similar sort of vibes

7201.92 --> 7207.08
from that and Einstein aren't you really

7204.56 --> 7210.4400000000005
even though one of their main people is

7207.08 --> 7213.739
a guy called um

7210.44 --> 7216.259999999999
uh Eric P something dollar and his

7213.739 --> 7218.299999999999
theory is the theory of anti-relativity

7216.26 --> 7220.280000000001
so he's positioning himself as against

7218.3 --> 7221.900000000001
Einstein

7220.28 --> 7223.94
but still

7221.9 --> 7226.219
sounding like

7223.94 --> 7228.379999999999
you know another medium that you need

7226.219 --> 7229.639
that doesn't exist at least they can't

7228.38 --> 7233.0
show it

7229.639 --> 7235.34
space time and stuff even on the um the

7233.0 --> 7238.159
quantum field Theory now we're trying to

7235.34 --> 7239.42
add Einstein into Quantum Mechanics for

7238.159 --> 7242.179
some reason I suppose it's just

7239.42 --> 7244.82
cosmology or theoretical physics they're

7242.179 --> 7247.76
calling the ether quantum foam or

7244.82 --> 7249.5599999999995
space-time foam now so the heliotenses

7247.76 --> 7252.08
do have ether in their model whether

7249.56 --> 7254.42
either people accept that or not it's

7252.08 --> 7257.48
it's in there right well it's just the

7254.42 --> 7259.28
next Gravity look even in the late 90s I

7257.48 --> 7261.259999999999
was hearing that gravity was getting

7259.28 --> 7263.84
disproven and all that

7261.26 --> 7265.6990000000005
right like within the actual Community

7263.84 --> 7267.139
even though colloquially it's never

7265.699 --> 7269.659
going to go away

7267.139 --> 7271.6990000000005
so yeah I guess they've moved on to the

7269.659 --> 7273.86
ether aberration and now it's like oh

7271.699 --> 7276.739
now it's all Ethan out it's not gravity

7273.86 --> 7279.5
anymore we're looking for its ether now

7276.739 --> 7282.799999999999
right and ether is a much bigger

7279.5 --> 7283.58
aberration than gravity much bigger I

7282.8 --> 7285.320000000001
mean

7283.58 --> 7287.659
not a lot of people throughout history

7285.32 --> 7291.34
were particularly concerned about

7287.659 --> 7294.92
figuring out gravity but a lot of people

7291.34 --> 7296.02
have been very concerned about this

7294.92 --> 7298.34
weird

7296.02 --> 7301.099
consistency of patterns that they've

7298.34 --> 7304.46
bumped into during their experiments and

7301.099 --> 7306.8
research like Tesla and so the

7304.46 --> 7309.38
speculation of ether has a Riven

7306.8 --> 7311.0
naturally

7309.38 --> 7313.58
with a lot of people throughout history

7311.0 --> 7316.159
so it's a much more prevalent aberration

7313.58 --> 7318.0199999999995
that you will bump into so yeah this is

7316.159 --> 7320.78
the etherean

7318.02 --> 7322.52
Wars right these These Are The Ether

7320.78 --> 7324.739
Wars it's now really coming to light

7322.52 --> 7327.370000000001
it's taking over from all sides it's

7324.739 --> 7329.0599999999995
also being popularized

7327.37 --> 7331.28
[Music]

7329.06 --> 7332.900000000001
but it's an aberration just like gravis

7331.28 --> 7334.46
it's just like gravity it's the same

7332.9 --> 7336.699
process and will have the same end

7334.46 --> 7336.699
result

7341.48 --> 7344.959999999999
yeah it's just a thing that you know

7343.34 --> 7347.900000000001
kiwi and Nathan doing these shows

7344.96 --> 7349.76
telling people about this most of jiren

7347.9 --> 7352.78
and Whitsett and Bob's followers are

7349.76 --> 7352.780000000001
never going to see those videos

7352.94 --> 7357.739
but maybe you know right now maybe

7354.86 --> 7359.299999999999
they'll see him at some point later on

7357.739 --> 7361.58
when they get bored of whatever they're

7359.3 --> 7364.88
watching now no no they are watching

7361.58 --> 7367.58
those videos they are

7364.88 --> 7370.28
I mean they watch everything you're

7367.58 --> 7372.26
talking about people that are now

7370.28 --> 7374.0
engaged with hostilities social

7372.26 --> 7377.84
hostilities with us

7374.0 --> 7379.94
and you do they watch everything we do

7377.84 --> 7381.92
just like the anti-flatter authors they

7379.94 --> 7385.04
do that too by the way right when they

7381.92 --> 7387.26
engage it's like oh we have to now be a

7385.04 --> 7389.9
spy agency and absorb everything they're

7387.26 --> 7392.599
saying so we can nitpick anything and

7389.9 --> 7394.339999999999
have as much maneuvering room for our

7392.599 --> 7396.9800000000005
constructed narrative that we're going

7394.34 --> 7399.26
to respond with as possible so yeah

7396.98 --> 7402.08
you'll bet your ass

7399.26 --> 7406.6990000000005
that Bob and Jaren and whitsid are

7402.08 --> 7409.699
watching every single Flat Earth debates

7406.699 --> 7412.28
since that time and probably some of

7409.699 --> 7414.5599999999995
mine as well I think that actually even

7412.28 --> 7417.44
jiren watched my show

7414.56 --> 7419.659000000001
a couple of times after I had like a

7417.44 --> 7422.178999999999
little segment it's like every time I I

7419.659 --> 7423.219
start criticizing anybody from over

7422.179 --> 7425.719
there

7423.219 --> 7428.119
they literally just watched my whole

7425.719 --> 7430.159
thing and just try to figure out how if

7428.119 --> 7432.5
they can respond to that in a sensible

7430.159 --> 7436.0
way or something they can get out of it

7432.5 --> 7436.0
but that rarely actually happens

7437.06 --> 7442.820000000001
no I think the best reference I got was

7439.76 --> 7444.5
Jaren saying about me like oh he'll just

7442.82 --> 7446.78
rage quit and throw something at the

7444.5 --> 7448.04
wall so that was the extent of what he

7446.78 --> 7450.259999999999
got out of me

7448.04 --> 7452.06
I guess everything I actually did say

7450.26 --> 7454.219
must have been a little bit too

7452.06 --> 7455.0
reasonable to be able to criticize it

7454.219 --> 7457.099
then

7455.0 --> 7461.98
ah Sharon

7457.099 --> 7461.9800000000005
I know I know I'm very good at what I do

7462.219 --> 7466.4
I was thinking more of their followers

7464.48 --> 7467.9
people who watch their videos how many

7466.4 --> 7471.44
of them are actually going to see me and

7467.9 --> 7473.9
Nathan and QE stuff Lots because

7471.44 --> 7476.9
yeah they do they watch their enemies

7473.9 --> 7479.119
right keep your enemies closer than your

7476.9 --> 7481.098999999999
friends

7479.119 --> 7482.9
what does it keep your friends close you

7481.099 --> 7486.56
keep your enemies closer that's what

7482.9 --> 7489.199
they do and in a way we have our people

7486.56 --> 7491.42
in effiti that do that too

7489.199 --> 7494.48
that are like oh we're going against

7491.42 --> 7497.78
them okay now we're going to like really

7494.48 --> 7500.178999999999
analyze every detail like I don't even

7497.78 --> 7502.5199999999995
do that because literally makes me kind

7500.179 --> 7504.9800000000005
of throw up like I really don't like

7502.52 --> 7508.88
these

7504.98 --> 7511.159
these battles because it's just so gross

7508.88 --> 7513.38
the opponent is so gross

7511.159 --> 7515.54
it's really [ __ ] up and it makes me

7513.38 --> 7520.3
ill but yeah

7515.54 --> 7520.3
people like Brian and slatsoid and

7521.119 --> 7526.46
Elijah they really just are like oh oh

7524.48 --> 7528.98
so we're out of comeback with them now

7526.46 --> 7531.38
so we're at a spot well they're gonna go

7528.98 --> 7533.36
full in and they absolutely they

7531.38 --> 7536.96
literally watch just the entire show and

7533.36 --> 7539.839999999999
all that like three hours of Whitsett

7536.96 --> 7543.56
rambling off against somebody they do

7539.84 --> 7545.54
that I I can't do it it literally gives

7543.56 --> 7546.619000000001
me a headache I cannot do that they do

7545.54 --> 7550.34
that though

7546.619 --> 7552.38
so it's not just glow Busters sending

7550.34 --> 7555.26
people over to analyze everything we say

7552.38 --> 7558.6990000000005
because we're in a spat with them no we

7555.26 --> 7558.6990000000005
have our guys that do that too

7559.099 --> 7563.179
it's just the principle of keep your

7561.5 --> 7565.719
friends close but keep your enemies

7563.179 --> 7565.719
closer

7566.179 --> 7570.8
anyway I just thought we all Busters the

7568.52 --> 7571.9400000000005
other day that um you know if John was

7570.8 --> 7573.7390000000005
going to go to all the trouble of making

7571.94 --> 7576.0199999999995
a presentation about widgets video I

7573.739 --> 7580.419999999999
might as well let him explain it I don't

7576.02 --> 7580.42
want to watch it twice yeah I know right

7580.46 --> 7584.599
uh

7582.26 --> 7586.099
no I didn't watch that

7584.599 --> 7589.52
I I like

7586.099 --> 7592.400000000001
looked at it for like 30 seconds and

7589.52 --> 7595.599
then it was oh God not this [ __ ] again

7592.4 --> 7598.339999999999
I'm not gonna do that

7595.599 --> 7602.84
like I don't want to ruin my evening

7598.34 --> 7605.38
just to be hyper specifically informed

7602.84 --> 7605.38
right

7606.32 --> 7609.92
you always think people especially

7607.82 --> 7612.5
Elijah is just trying to keep

7609.92 --> 7614.599
Bridges open sort of thing

7612.5 --> 7615.739
so you're not completely cut off from

7614.599 --> 7617.54
each other but

7615.739 --> 7620.119
I'm not sure what you could say to Bob

7617.54 --> 7621.8
or jiren or Whitsett to you know they've

7620.119 --> 7624.08
doubled down on all their nonsense

7621.8 --> 7626.360000000001
haven't they there's nothing you can see

7624.08 --> 7628.46
there's nothing we can do they've

7626.36 --> 7631.28
already they burned the bridge already

7628.46 --> 7633.32
they already did it

7631.28 --> 7635.42
right and they could just like oh but

7633.32 --> 7637.759999999999
maybe we should put out the flames and

7635.42 --> 7639.38
maybe slowly start rebuilding their

7637.76 --> 7641.780000000001
bridge but no they're just letting it

7639.38 --> 7645.5
burn they have from the start and if

7641.78 --> 7650.119
especially wits it is shown just like

7645.5 --> 7653.32
real Savage level psychological warfare

7650.119 --> 7656.299999999999
like with his will where he's like

7653.32 --> 7658.699
he's literally just like I'm going in

7656.3 --> 7659.659000000001
like a Sith Lord and just I'm gonna [ __ ]

7658.699 --> 7663.638999999999
you up

7659.659 --> 7663.638999999999
not with arguments but mentally

7664.639 --> 7668.900000000001
he's gone there

7666.56 --> 7672.26
and he is doing it and keeping doing it

7668.9 --> 7674.86
I mean that's psychological warfare with

7672.26 --> 7674.860000000001
lies

7676.52 --> 7681.139
so

7678.679 --> 7684.099
they burned that bridge it's It's Gonna

7681.139 --> 7684.099
Keep On burning

7688.82 --> 7692.78
right I think I'm gonna end the show

7691.28 --> 7694.5199999999995
though it's been going on for over two

7692.78 --> 7694.88
hours by now

7694.52 --> 7700.969
okay

7694.88 --> 7700.969
[Music]

7703.2 --> 7706.95
[Music]

7707.78 --> 7715.84
all right so yeah this

7710.84 --> 7715.84
Guild it seems to work relatively okay

7716.119 --> 7722.78
I do not like yeah issues the only issue

7721.04 --> 7725.119
is wearing this freaking headphone I

7722.78 --> 7728.179
really don't like that

7725.119 --> 7730.699
but yeah it's been interesting it's good

7728.179 --> 7732.619
to have somebody just do your speaker

7730.699 --> 7735.259999999999
position so your mic doesn't pick them

7732.619 --> 7736.82
up so well you might have to play around

7735.26 --> 7739.280000000001
with it quite a bit

7736.82 --> 7741.82
can't do that

7739.28 --> 7745.159
okay I mean

7741.82 --> 7746.0599999999995
I do not have enough room to get the key

7745.159 --> 7749.239
part

7746.06 --> 7752.42
I mean my mic is literally like 30

7749.239 --> 7754.5199999999995
centimeters away from my speaker

7752.42 --> 7756.38
and it works fine I mean in Google Plus

7754.52 --> 7758.42
and all that works great but apparently

7756.38 --> 7760.52
there is some feedback when I do it in

7758.42 --> 7762.5
this setup

7760.52 --> 7764.540000000001
it's also because I don't really have a

7762.5 --> 7767.659
good centralized sound

7764.54 --> 7770.0
banana system right I don't have that it

7767.659 --> 7771.799999999999
wouldn't work

7770.0 --> 7774.8
I've got a whole bunch of things that

7771.8 --> 7777.02
just won't work and then Nathan and

7774.8 --> 7780.34
I had a meeting try to help me out and

7777.02 --> 7780.34
then it just doesn't work

7781.4 --> 7785.839999999999
no so it hasn't worked for like three

7783.44 --> 7788.54
years and it still doesn't work

7785.84 --> 7790.82
just like telegram still doesn't work

7788.54 --> 7793.58
yes

7790.82 --> 7795.5
anyway I'm not gonna complain about that

7793.58 --> 7797.0599999999995
too much but I am going to round out the

7795.5 --> 7798.32
