hold on

89.59 --> 101.84
[Music]

95.52 --> 101.84
right uh yeah

104.56 --> 108.56
good morning it's sunday our sunday

107.439 --> 111.6
afternoon in europe

108.56 --> 114.24000000000001
morning in the united states the weather

111.6 --> 115.05999999999999
today is quite remarkably beautiful

114.24 --> 119.119
check this out

115.06 --> 121.92
[Music]

119.119 --> 121.92
look at that

127.52 --> 130.879
pretty clear and blue there are some

129.84 --> 133.599
yeah

130.879 --> 134.39999999999998
trails no i don't even call them cram

133.599 --> 136.16
trails these

134.4 --> 138.56
these days because i literally don't

136.16 --> 140.48
know what type of trails they are they

138.56 --> 143.76
could be dust trails it could be

140.48 --> 146.39999999999998
whatever they're certainly not moist

143.76 --> 147.35999999999999
because moist doesn't really spread out

146.4 --> 149.59900000000002
like that

147.36 --> 150.72000000000003
that's simply not possible moist

149.599 --> 153.04
absolutely

150.72 --> 154.48
behaves in a different way so i just

153.04 --> 156.16
call them trails

154.48 --> 157.84
right and then yeah you can think of

156.16 --> 160.64
those trails whatever they are i'm not

157.84 --> 163.36
sure whether they just friendly dust for

160.64 --> 164.95899999999997
basic matter weather modification covert

163.36 --> 167.28
or not

164.959 --> 168.56
or whether they are like i don't know

167.28 --> 173.519
experiment [ __ ]

168.56 --> 173.519
or maybe just to freak us out but

174.0 --> 177.68
there's very little of it and yeah look

176.4 --> 180.8
at the bright

177.68 --> 184.4
bright bright zone very beautiful

180.8 --> 185.59900000000002
i went for some groceries right before

184.4 --> 188.239
the show

185.599 --> 189.28
like i had 45 minutes rushed it even

188.239 --> 190.879
stopped over

189.28 --> 192.4
at the church because somebody was

190.879 --> 194.0
standing in front of it that i knew

192.4 --> 195.76000000000002
and that i really liked the person that

194.0 --> 198.879
i remember from

195.76 --> 201.12
my year that i went there every sunday

198.879 --> 202.159
and yeah i talked to him for just a few

201.12 --> 203.36
minutes quickly

202.159 --> 205.2
and asked him yeah what do you think

203.36 --> 208.959
about covetings yeah of course

205.2 --> 210.72
and so oh right yeah yeah it's all fake

208.959 --> 212.64000000000001
and i'm embarrassed to death for the

210.72 --> 214.239
entire christian world

212.64 --> 216.95899999999997
how they are responding to this and that

214.239 --> 220.239
they are letting themselves

216.959 --> 220.879
basically get evicted and all that over

220.239 --> 223.92000000000002
this

220.879 --> 224.319
incredible nonsense so it was pretty

223.92 --> 228.07999999999998
hard

224.319 --> 232.48
on even showed some

228.08 --> 232.959
some tongue some bad words that normally

232.48 --> 235.439
it's

232.959 --> 237.04
[ __ ] and all that yeah that's i

235.439 --> 238.239
didn't do that back that was free like

237.04 --> 241.35999999999999
they don't like that

238.239 --> 242.239
i apologize because yeah it is it's a

241.36 --> 244.56
good guy

242.239 --> 245.84
basically telling like it's all a lie

244.56 --> 249.28
it's all a giant

245.84 --> 252.0
mega corporate sponsored scam

249.28 --> 254.4
and it's there specifically to destroy

252.0 --> 257.28
the goodwill and

254.4 --> 257.68
freedom you didn't expect that then

257.28 --> 260.479
again

257.68 --> 260.79900000000004
it's me he knew me so he knew that he

260.479 --> 262.479
would

260.799 --> 266.08
should be expecting that sort of thing

262.479 --> 268.71999999999997
from me when he says hello

266.08 --> 271.19899999999996
but it was good uh he said that at least

268.72 --> 274.32000000000005
the church is still open but that people

271.199 --> 275.52000000000004
apparently quickly go away again and i

274.32 --> 278.32
said why

275.52 --> 280.24
yeah well because yeah because of the

278.32 --> 282.08
contamination danger and i was like oh

280.24 --> 284.40000000000003
my god

282.08 --> 286.8
don't you read the bible you know that

284.4 --> 289.52
the bible talks about this

286.8 --> 292.32
about what that is the plagues maybe you

289.52 --> 295.35999999999996
should look into that

292.32 --> 298.08
and then draw the parallels

295.36 --> 299.84000000000003
the the comparisons the parallels to now

298.08 --> 301.68
what is actually happening

299.84 --> 303.19899999999996
maybe you could learn something from

301.68 --> 306.56
that

303.199 --> 308.40000000000003
but i don't i don't know i don't

306.56 --> 311.44
maybe he caught on a little you know

308.4 --> 314.71999999999997
that guy is not a complete fool

311.44 --> 318.32
he has a spirit that's good

314.72 --> 321.44000000000005
he's just a mormon and

318.32 --> 322.479
very nice and going along so that's kind

321.44 --> 326.32
of that problem

322.479 --> 328.479
but it was kind of good to bump into him

326.32 --> 329.759
right and yeah i'm not really that

328.479 --> 331.84
mormon anymore

329.759 --> 333.6
especially when you look at this title

331.84 --> 338.08
savage another politic

333.6 --> 340.47900000000004
and all of an apologetic murderous truth

338.08 --> 341.38
because that's really me now that's what

340.479 --> 344.0
i am

341.38 --> 346.71999999999997
[Music]

344.0 --> 348.4
or yeah maybe you could call me a

346.72 --> 351.6
extremist

348.4 --> 355.19899999999996
a free speech extremist

351.6 --> 360.47900000000004
i like that yeah that's it

355.199 --> 360.479
that's it i'm a free speech extremist

361.36 --> 364.639
and that doesn't mean that i'm gonna

363.039 --> 367.12
push free speech

364.639 --> 369.68
into destruction which is what the

367.12 --> 372.88
pharisees do

369.68 --> 375.6
where they literally push people's

372.88 --> 377.36
boundaries and like no you can say this

375.6 --> 380.47900000000004
too you can say

377.36 --> 383.6
the most disgusting vile lies

380.479 --> 385.75899999999996
provable lies that you want and then get

383.6 --> 388.56
away with it that's free speech

385.759 --> 390.24
no no no no i'm gonna say the most

388.56 --> 393.12
horrific

390.24 --> 394.0
unapologetic murderous truth that'll

393.12 --> 397.72
drive people

394.0 --> 402.199
to suicide if necessary

397.72 --> 406.56
because it is true and potentially

402.199 --> 409.759
unbearable and it must be said

406.56 --> 410.4
and i will have every [ __ ] spirit in

409.759 --> 414.0
the world

410.4 --> 416.88
hear it whether they have eyes to see

414.0 --> 417.44
ears the hair or a brain to understand

416.88 --> 419.84
they will

417.44 --> 421.36
hear it they will hear it in their dream

419.84 --> 423.919
they will hear it

421.36 --> 426.08000000000004
in death in their spirit in the

423.919 --> 429.44
afterlife they will hear it

426.08 --> 433.28
i'm gonna wake up this world and

429.44 --> 436.759
drive the devil out forever

433.28 --> 440.23999999999995
so that people will not be

436.759 --> 443.52000000000004
susceptible anymore to this

440.24 --> 445.599
[ __ ] [ __ ] eternal corruption

443.52 --> 451.84
cycle from which you cannot escape in

445.599 --> 451.84
which you are poured into from birth

458.16 --> 462.08000000000004
yeah welcome back

462.8 --> 466.479
i got a lot of stuff here and i'm gonna

465.28 --> 469.919
try out some

466.479 --> 472.15999999999997
cup yeah some drinky stuffies i got

469.919 --> 474.479
really good quality high grade apple

472.16 --> 475.52000000000004
juice this time they're real organic

474.479 --> 478.08
stuff

475.52 --> 480.79999999999995
damage air quality just like the

478.08 --> 483.039
agriculture god from the greeks right

480.8 --> 484.56
it's i don't care if it's pantheonic or

483.039 --> 486.639
whatever the [ __ ]

484.56 --> 488.16
this basically means this is the best

486.639 --> 490.8
freaking quality

488.16 --> 492.0
in industry possible the only better

490.8 --> 495.44
thing i can conceive of

492.0 --> 498.639
is if you have your own very special

495.44 --> 499.36
buddhist monk grilled apple vinegar or

498.639 --> 503.039
apple

499.36 --> 504.8
vineyard where every freaking tree has

503.039 --> 505.44
is like surrounded by a circle of

504.8 --> 507.68
buddhists

505.44 --> 508.71999999999997
meditating to it all day long since its

507.68 --> 511.039
conception

508.72 --> 513.279
and then every apple is squeezed

511.039 --> 514.3199999999999
specifically by the heel of the dalai

513.279 --> 516.32
lama or something

514.32 --> 518.0
i don't know it sounds ridiculous you

516.32 --> 519.279
know it's always something better as

518.0 --> 521.599
always possible but this

519.279 --> 523.12
is basically the best apple juice that i

521.599 --> 526.9590000000001
can find

523.12 --> 529.76
so i always love that brand demeter

526.959 --> 534.2399999999999
it's not a brand it's it's like a yeah a

529.76 --> 537.4399999999999
quality mark

534.24 --> 539.6
so yeah hey if you want to

537.44 --> 540.8800000000001
would it be pretty cool to have an apple

539.6 --> 544.8000000000001
vineyard

540.88 --> 547.92
with do you call it a an archery sorry

544.8 --> 553.519
vineyard that's why that's

547.92 --> 553.519
cherries an apple or archer

553.68 --> 557.12
like with buddhists that just meditate

556.16 --> 561.1999999999999
their whole day

557.12 --> 563.279
around the trees yeah i also got this

561.2 --> 565.6800000000001
kind of experimental i had another thing

563.279 --> 570.08
too i left it in the fridge

565.68 --> 574.8389999999999
and yeah this is just raw ginger juice

570.08 --> 577.839
seems interesting smells extremely

574.839 --> 577.839
gingery

578.0 --> 584.399
oh wow

581.76 --> 584.399
it's hot

584.8 --> 587.8389999999999
and yeah this way it's funny enough it

587.2 --> 590.72
can

587.839 --> 592.24
le it could probably last a lot longer

590.72 --> 596.24
than just having these

592.24 --> 597.519
things which yeah tend to dry out over

596.24 --> 600.399
time

597.519 --> 601.92
so maybe gonna mix it up a little

600.399 --> 603.92
because there's also you can also just

601.92 --> 606.079
buy apple juice with a little ginger in

603.92 --> 606.079
it

606.64 --> 609.68
let's taste it like this for

610.48 --> 615.519
oh that's already really nice

616.079 --> 620.3199999999999
boop a little

624.399 --> 629.839
got some honey squirt

628.0 --> 631.839
for if i didn't think it's sweet enough

629.839 --> 634.9590000000001
but yeah i just tasted the apple juice

631.839 --> 634.9590000000001
probably not necessary

642.16 --> 646.64
yeah that's nice it doesn't really taste

645.04 --> 649.92
like ginger but it has like a light

646.64 --> 649.92
flare of it now i like it

655.279 --> 658.64
right yeah because i went all through

656.959 --> 662.7199999999999
the apple juice and i was like

658.64 --> 662.72
but i want more apple juice

663.2 --> 668.88
by the way stomach it's yeah i've eaten

666.56 --> 670.88
i've had a full meal yesterday broccoli

668.88 --> 673.2
chicken it was freaking awesome it took

670.88 --> 675.04
some time to chow down

673.2 --> 676.72
like took me over an hour while normally

675.04 --> 680.0
when i'm eating i'm pretty pretty much

676.72 --> 682.64
done in in between 20 to 30 minutes

680.0 --> 684.399
taking longer so yeah it's still taking

682.64 --> 686.64
its time but i actually ate

684.399 --> 688.0
i'm not nauseated anymore i just have a

686.64 --> 691.76
little like my stomach

688.0 --> 694.16
a little slightly cramped sour still an

691.76 --> 694.16
issue

699.6 --> 705.6800000000001
terret 3006 when i told you

702.959 --> 708.0
have you looked into apples that was a

705.68 --> 708.0
joke

709.04 --> 712.48
you do realize that right that was not

712.24 --> 714.88
an

712.48 --> 716.16
order for you to now become an apple

714.88 --> 718.8
specialist and know

716.16 --> 721.12
everything relating to apples just so

718.8 --> 721.12
you know

725.2 --> 729.6
oh yeah another little bonus i gave

727.44 --> 730.24
myself because i really missed kind of

729.6 --> 732.8000000000001
the the

730.24 --> 735.519
at the acid stuff which is mint paste i

732.8 --> 737.1999999999999
kind of bought just regular mints

735.519 --> 739.36
because i'm not gonna keep eating those

737.2 --> 742.0790000000001
anti-acid things but i did really miss

739.36 --> 742.0790000000001
the mint taste

742.24 --> 748.8
my saliva has only slightly died down

745.519 --> 748.8
it's still very annoying

748.959 --> 753.5999999999999
but having had a full meal yesterday

751.04 --> 757.04
night definitely did help oh yeah

753.6 --> 759.9200000000001
also ate like bread again

757.04 --> 760.639
it was very nice eight uh still got one

759.92 --> 762.4799999999999
left and then

760.639 --> 764.0790000000001
bought two whole new packets with six

762.48 --> 767.6
each

764.079 --> 772.959
it's like these little

767.6 --> 776.24
blocks with uh

772.959 --> 777.279
pumpkin seeds on them and like cheese

776.24 --> 779.839
sprinkles

777.279 --> 782.16
delicious i got an oven put them in

779.839 --> 785.2790000000001
there for like 10 minutes

782.16 --> 788.079
absolutely gorgeous and i don't need

785.279 --> 788.079
anything on them

797.44 --> 802.0
and you might be noticing that yeah i've

800.16 --> 804.56
absolutely strengthened up

802.0 --> 804.56
overall

806.959 --> 809.76
since last week

812.079 --> 815.76
i look like i lost some weight since i

814.399 --> 819.36
you last see me

815.76 --> 822.079
really well

819.36 --> 824.639
if you would have said that uh literally

822.079 --> 824.6389999999999
last week

838.88 --> 846.0
hungry a lot

842.48 --> 847.44
insanity insanity right so anyway let's

846.0 --> 850.48
look for this chat

847.44 --> 852.0
before it gets too big george sanford

850.48 --> 855.519
was first

852.0 --> 858.88
turret 306. gary bennett ryan

855.519 --> 862.399
q vincent ray d

858.88 --> 864.16
barry davis stone monkey 3d here we go

862.399 --> 866.88
again

864.16 --> 866.88
sledgehammer

868.24 --> 872.8
yeah no yeah make a remark like that

870.88 --> 874.72
first and banning you

872.8 --> 876.4799999999999
don't you [ __ ] tell me to drive the

874.72 --> 878.32
devil out of me what do you think this

876.48 --> 881.44
is

878.32 --> 884.72
this is the inquisitor coming out

881.44 --> 888.1600000000001
yeah i'm a paladin i'm an inquisitor

884.72 --> 892.24
this is what i do i'm here to

888.16 --> 894.8
basically purify this [ __ ] world

892.24 --> 895.519
and i have no devil in me my only devil

894.8 --> 899.279
is a

895.519 --> 902.72
furious furious will

899.279 --> 905.12
of persecuting the darkness

902.72 --> 907.6800000000001
and that's not oh attack everyone

905.12 --> 910.32
because everyone is inferior and i'm the

907.68 --> 914.56
only one special boy now that means

910.32 --> 917.839
i am going to savagely brutally address

914.56 --> 920.399
and point out with great accuracy

917.839 --> 923.0400000000001
and spiritual precision the darkness

920.399 --> 926.24
that you even try to hide from yourself

923.04 --> 929.68
not to expose you but

926.24 --> 932.48
to make it scene for those who are

929.68 --> 936.3199999999999
willing to look

932.48 --> 940.16
just so you know sledgehammer

936.32 --> 942.9590000000001
right hello samson

940.16 --> 942.959
see it's a doubt

948.399 --> 951.759
i never believe labels it could be

950.32 --> 954.9590000000001
anything inequality

951.759 --> 958.5600000000001
no that's wrong no it's a specific

954.959 --> 961.5189999999999
paid for registered quality mark

958.56 --> 963.4399999999999
has very specific demands and if the

961.519 --> 964.16
people that do the quality checking do

963.44 --> 967.519
it wrong

964.16 --> 969.68
they go to jail yeah

967.519 --> 973.12
and that's why i like it because it's

969.68 --> 976.6389999999999
literally enforced quality control

973.12 --> 979.92
it's of course basically a an owned

976.639 --> 982.5600000000001
system but they are bound to it

979.92 --> 984.3199999999999
and if they falsify it they become

982.56 --> 987.3599999999999
liable

984.32 --> 990.24
they they'll go to jail it's basically

987.36 --> 990.8000000000001
fraud it's false advertising it's like

990.24 --> 992.88
saying oh

990.8 --> 994.56
this is organic oh it's not organic by

992.88 --> 996.399
the official standards oh

994.56 --> 998.3199999999999
so you've committed fraud well you're

996.399 --> 999.279
going to jail now and your business is

998.32 --> 1001.519
closed

999.279 --> 1003.36
yeah that's what i like that's what i

1001.519 --> 1006.8
like that's what i want

1003.36 --> 1007.36
when people advertise that it is special

1006.8 --> 1009.4399999999999
or good

1007.36 --> 1010.399
it's all very cute but if there's a

1009.44 --> 1013.6800000000001
specific

1010.399 --> 1014.399
mark for that that actually guarantees

1013.68 --> 1017.3599999999999
it

1014.399 --> 1018.639
by specifically set out rules and rule

1017.36 --> 1020.88
enforcement

1018.639 --> 1022.0790000000001
then you know it's not going to be some

1020.88 --> 1025.36
[ __ ]

1022.079 --> 1027.76
schemer you get it

1025.36 --> 1029.6789999999999
no i didn't vote in the election i don't

1027.76 --> 1030.8799999999999
vote in elections i haven't voted in

1029.679 --> 1032.88
years

1030.88 --> 1034.5590000000002
i wouldn't even know what freaking party

1032.88 --> 1036.48
to vote for at this point you know if

1034.559 --> 1037.12
i'm gonna get involved in politics then

1036.48 --> 1039.76
i will

1037.12 --> 1041.839
be that freaking politics i'm not gonna

1039.76 --> 1045.199
vote on a party

1041.839 --> 1048.1599999999999
they're all corrupt as [ __ ]

1045.199 --> 1050.559
it's like an industry here man like you

1048.16 --> 1053.52
have to become like a corporation first

1050.559 --> 1056.559
before you can even approach

1053.52 --> 1060.48
being part of politics it's

1056.559 --> 1062.0
sick there's too many rules too many

1060.48 --> 1065.52
bureaucracy [ __ ] to

1062.0 --> 1068.88
ever really do anything normally

1065.52 --> 1071.6
you know so i'm yeah i've retracted from

1068.88 --> 1073.2800000000002
politics some time ago last party that i

1071.6 --> 1075.6
had some interest in was the pirate

1073.28 --> 1076.799
party still kind of think they're kind

1075.6 --> 1079.12
of cool

1076.799 --> 1080.32
but yeah there are leftists they're

1079.12 --> 1083.3999999999999
leftists

1080.32 --> 1085.52
kind of like in the yeah

1083.4 --> 1087.44
anti-technocrats

1085.52 --> 1089.039
then again there's a great likelihood

1087.44 --> 1091.039
that they have been invaded by

1089.039 --> 1092.96
technocrats and i already noticed that

1091.039 --> 1094.559
when i started the first deal with like

1092.96 --> 1095.1200000000001
meetings and [ __ ] which they also have

1094.559 --> 1097.28
online

1095.12 --> 1099.6789999999999
that there's some really disgusting

1097.28 --> 1103.6789999999999
politic political people in there

1099.679 --> 1107.039
that are all day the only thing they do

1103.679 --> 1108.24
the only thing they do is research

1107.039 --> 1110.16
people

1108.24 --> 1112.0
trying to find dirt on them and then

1110.16 --> 1113.6000000000001
kick them out that's the only [ __ ]

1112.0 --> 1115.76
thing they seem to be doing

1113.6 --> 1117.36
and they whine about everything

1115.76 --> 1121.039
conceivable

1117.36 --> 1124.799
terrible right and that's a good party

1121.039 --> 1124.799
compared to most so

1125.6 --> 1129.52
yeah that's what i think about elections

1132.4 --> 1140.799
right let me continue the list

1135.84 --> 1140.799
sanity man hancock

1141.12 --> 1144.4799999999998
various vogans

1146.0 --> 1149.28
what jared needs no help for that well

1148.48 --> 1152.64
what

1149.28 --> 1153.2
know oh wait that's like five minutes

1152.64 --> 1156.3200000000002
ago

1153.2 --> 1158.799
whatever uh eagle played an anchor good

1156.32 --> 1158.799
to see you

1159.6 --> 1165.28
feeling better yeah seated out of course

1162.96 --> 1166.4
i wouldn't be rambling like this as

1165.28 --> 1170.08
fluid as i was

1166.4 --> 1170.0800000000002
if i wasn't uh

1171.679 --> 1178.4
needs 95 needs percent 95

1175.36 --> 1181.1999999999998
needs to be organic in uk

1178.4 --> 1182.3200000000002
before you can call it organic so a

1181.2 --> 1185.8400000000001
producer can

1182.32 --> 1188.08
seal a product at 95

1185.84 --> 1189.76
and call it organic but it actually

1188.08 --> 1193.9189999999999
ain't say

1189.76 --> 1196.0
said it ain't says for it's what

1193.919 --> 1199.2800000000002
can you please write down a coherent

1196.0 --> 1199.28
sentence agm

1199.76 --> 1203.039
all right hello amanda young

1203.28 --> 1207.84
good to see you

1210.58 --> 1213.71
[Music]

1233.52 --> 1238.08
yeah yeah that's correct agm yes there

1236.96 --> 1240.4
is a standard

1238.08 --> 1241.4399999999998
european policy it's probably the same

1240.4 --> 1243.44
in england

1241.44 --> 1245.8400000000001
because england and europe is very much

1243.44 --> 1247.6000000000001
synchronized concerning food

1245.84 --> 1249.36
it's pretty decent it's still one of the

1247.6 --> 1253.12
best standards in the world

1249.36 --> 1256.799
in the world right we are very

1253.12 --> 1257.9189999999999
very unbelievably lucky we have a

1256.799 --> 1260.559
relatively good

1257.919 --> 1261.2800000000002
organic standard for food we could have

1260.559 --> 1263.28
also been

1261.28 --> 1265.32
right in the middle of 1984 where

1263.28 --> 1268.32
everything is absolutely

1265.32 --> 1271.52
exclusively poison okay

1268.32 --> 1274.08
thank your lucky stars and god

1271.52 --> 1274.8799999999999
the almighty we have a freaking organic

1274.08 --> 1278.08
standard that's

1274.88 --> 1279.2
halfway decent here so don't [ __ ]

1278.08 --> 1282.32
complain about it or

1279.2 --> 1282.88
kick you out you hear me we're [ __ ]

1282.32 --> 1285.76
lucky

1282.88 --> 1287.2800000000002
we're not all eating poison right now

1285.76 --> 1291.2
because there is nothing else

1287.28 --> 1294.48
okay right

1291.2 --> 1295.3600000000001
yeah it's true there is this stupid rule

1294.48 --> 1297.76
system

1295.36 --> 1300.0
where there is some margin where you can

1297.76 --> 1303.44
get non-organic [ __ ] in there

1300.0 --> 1304.32
but this is not just unconditional it's

1303.44 --> 1307.919
not like oh wait

1304.32 --> 1308.6399999999999
yeah you take the 95 that's absolutely

1307.919 --> 1310.48
pure

1308.64 --> 1312.4
and then you fill it up with five

1310.48 --> 1316.48
percent pure poison

1312.4 --> 1319.76
no no that's not how it works

1316.48 --> 1321.919
it's not how it works at all at all so

1319.76 --> 1324.24
if you think it works like that you're

1321.919 --> 1327.2
wrong and you're delusional

1324.24 --> 1327.52
get it it's not how it works no it's

1327.2 --> 1330.799
phil

1327.52 --> 1331.84
still very much said that there is any

1330.799 --> 1334.8799999999999
trace

1331.84 --> 1337.12
of certain types of things in the food

1334.88 --> 1338.159
it's not organic doesn't matter even if

1337.12 --> 1342.08
it's like a

1338.159 --> 1345.2800000000002
pro mill it's a hundredth of a percent

1342.08 --> 1346.08
no it's organic when certain conditions

1345.28 --> 1349.44
are met

1346.08 --> 1352.1589999999999
no matter what it's just that

1349.44 --> 1355.52
if you have side products that are just

1352.159 --> 1361.8400000000001
unattainable organic for some reason

1355.52 --> 1361.84
like okay i can't use uh

1364.4 --> 1368.88
or something and there is just not

1366.48 --> 1371.039
enough organic in the industry

1368.88 --> 1374.48
to have that now that can you you could

1371.039 --> 1376.48
use everything organic except the misena

1374.48 --> 1378.559
and then you have that nun in there and

1376.48 --> 1379.3600000000001
then you can still sell it as an organic

1378.559 --> 1381.6789999999999
product

1379.36 --> 1383.28
it will be have to be registered that

1381.679 --> 1385.76
it's not organic that part

1383.28 --> 1386.799
right it's very important so it won't be

1385.76 --> 1390.559
perfect

1386.799 --> 1391.679
that's not the same as that oh okay well

1390.559 --> 1394.32
that means that

1391.679 --> 1395.8600000000001
all the things about no msg oh by the

1394.32 --> 1397.6
way that's not even a rule no

1395.86 --> 1400.6399999999999
[Music]

1397.6 --> 1403.1999999999998
no aspartame and no

1400.64 --> 1404.0800000000002
artificial sweeteners and collar [ __ ]

1403.2 --> 1407.1200000000001
that that's still

1404.08 --> 1410.3999999999999
in there in the other five no

1407.12 --> 1413.52
no that's not the case at

1410.4 --> 1416.72
all so don't misconstrue that don't

1413.52 --> 1420.1589999999999
slander the organic label or i'll

1416.72 --> 1420.799
kick you out you get it you don't want

1420.159 --> 1423.7600000000002
to eat it

1420.799 --> 1424.559
fine you go to the regular supermarket

1423.76 --> 1428.559
you go to the

1424.559 --> 1430.0
bony or to the slico or whatever the

1428.559 --> 1432.32
[ __ ] kind of supermarket you

1430.0 --> 1434.159
got for the base people you go get your

1432.32 --> 1434.96
base things it's very cheap it's good

1434.159 --> 1437.919
enough for you

1434.96 --> 1440.559
good go and eat it i'm gonna get organic

1437.919 --> 1443.44
brand only and i don't give a [ __ ]

1440.559 --> 1445.039
if it's not a hundred percent you know

1443.44 --> 1447.679
why they even did that

1445.039 --> 1449.84
so that it would be halfway viable and

1447.679 --> 1451.039
there wouldn't be some nazi regime that

1449.84 --> 1453.76
would constantly just

1451.039 --> 1454.4
pick out any company they selectively

1453.76 --> 1457.76
liked

1454.4 --> 1460.24
that had a half percent oops somebody

1457.76 --> 1461.039
secret some agent threw some non-organic

1460.24 --> 1464.96
[ __ ] in there

1461.039 --> 1469.12
oh shut down the company right that's

1464.96 --> 1472.24
why they did that not to sneak in poison

1469.12 --> 1474.799
it was a safeguard to prevent total

1472.24 --> 1477.679
corruption and collapse of the industry

1474.799 --> 1477.679
do you understand

1478.48 --> 1483.679
right walmart yeah that's what it meant

1484.72 --> 1490.08
aspartame is a get the [ __ ] out of here

1490.72 --> 1495.679
aspartame is not a freaking organic

1493.52 --> 1497.9189999999999
product you freak

1495.679 --> 1499.76
it's literally you know what that is

1497.919 --> 1504.3200000000002
that [ __ ]

1499.76 --> 1506.0
what aspartame is what the hell

1504.32 --> 1508.96
and i'm not gonna censor you that's

1506.0 --> 1510.559
disgusting you know what that is

1508.96 --> 1513.679
do you actually know what the [ __ ]

1510.559 --> 1517.039
you're saying seeds are down

1513.679 --> 1519.44
yeah but do you know what it is

1517.039 --> 1522.08
you know where it comes from the history

1519.44 --> 1525.2
of aspartame

1522.08 --> 1525.76
you know where they came it up with it

1525.2 --> 1528.88
was

1525.76 --> 1533.52
during the iraq war when they

1528.88 --> 1536.64
figured out that their chemical warfare

1533.52 --> 1540.08
agent to kill

1536.64 --> 1543.679
people turned out to have a little

1540.08 --> 1547.4399999999998
sea sweetie sweetie cytast

1543.679 --> 1551.3600000000001
yeah that's what [ __ ] aspartame is

1547.44 --> 1555.1200000000001
it's literally a chemical warfare

1551.36 --> 1559.1999999999998
agent officially

1555.12 --> 1562.559
do you understand you freak

1559.2 --> 1565.919
it's organic you know what it is it's

1562.559 --> 1569.12
modified bacteria that eat

1565.919 --> 1569.1200000000001
chemical [ __ ]

1569.2 --> 1573.76
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

1570.96 --> 1573.76
saying buddy

1573.919 --> 1580.88
it's it's the most unorganic thing

1578.0 --> 1583.039
humans have probably ever produced

1580.88 --> 1584.0
before there was any real genetic

1583.039 --> 1586.4
modification

1584.0 --> 1587.44
it's like an early stage genetic

1586.4 --> 1590.88
modification

1587.44 --> 1594.48
side product experiment the hell

1590.88 --> 1596.0
are you saying man learn your [ __ ]

1594.48 --> 1599.84
history you don't know what the [ __ ]

1596.0 --> 1599.84
you're saying sees it out

1600.08 --> 1602.48
freak

1604.559 --> 1610.24
like that's unacceptable

1607.679 --> 1611.1200000000001
it's absolutely unacceptable to say

1610.24 --> 1613.84
something that's

1611.12 --> 1613.84
stupid here

1614.24 --> 1621.279
aspartame being natural

1617.84 --> 1624.0
freak it's a chemical warfare

1621.279 --> 1624.72
agent that's literally where it came

1624.0 --> 1629.0
from

1624.72 --> 1631.679
how it was discovered you understand

1629.0 --> 1634.88
officially ron

1631.679 --> 1638.8400000000001
don rumsfeld discovered it

1634.88 --> 1641.8400000000001
and introduced it into the food

1638.84 --> 1641.84
circuit

1647.36 --> 1652.24
right if you want look and there's

1648.64 --> 1656.3200000000002
plenty of alternative

1652.24 --> 1658.72
non-sugar sweeteners like stevia

1656.32 --> 1661.2
which is actually purely natural it's

1658.72 --> 1664.559
literally squished from a plant

1661.2 --> 1668.3990000000001
right it's really damn sweet

1664.559 --> 1672.48
and there's others by now there's plenty

1668.399 --> 1674.559
but aspartame is the absolute counter

1672.48 --> 1678.0
opposite of natural you cannot get

1674.559 --> 1681.76
something more unnatural than aspartame

1678.0 --> 1682.0
you cannot you don't know what the [ __ ]

1681.76 --> 1684.559
you're

1682.0 --> 1684.559
saying man

1692.2 --> 1698.32
[Music]

1695.12 --> 1701.6
look it up youtube it it's open history

1698.32 --> 1701.6
since the freaking 80s

1702.559 --> 1708.32
i knew this [ __ ] 20 years ago 20 years

1708.84 --> 1711.84
ago

1712.559 --> 1717.44
really sad man sorry to get rough on you

1716.08 --> 1721.1999999999998
but that's just

1717.44 --> 1724.97
that's too much

1721.2 --> 1728.039
it's too much

1724.97 --> 1728.039
[Music]

1730.159 --> 1737.2
oh everywhere you look it says organic

1734.159 --> 1741.2
ready so it says organic

1737.2 --> 1744.24
oh right so

1741.2 --> 1753.1200000000001
if you have a a product

1744.24 --> 1756.88
like um let's see

1753.12 --> 1756.8799999999999
all right so let's just say

1761.44 --> 1768.159
oh let's see what can i find

1765.52 --> 1769.36
what can i find that is absolutely

1768.159 --> 1773.6000000000001
blatantly

1769.36 --> 1773.6
not organic right

1774.32 --> 1778.399
right so let's say this thing this thing

1776.72 --> 1781.44
right

1778.399 --> 1784.4799999999998
this very special little

1781.44 --> 1788.799
rubber thingy club right

1784.48 --> 1791.6
yeah if it has if it says organic

1788.799 --> 1793.039
on it right it says organic i write

1791.6 --> 1796.6399999999999
organic

1793.039 --> 1801.76
on it does that mean that it's

1796.64 --> 1804.88
organic that it is part of the

1801.76 --> 1806.64
like the food industry right yeah you're

1804.88 --> 1809.0390000000002
getting a timeout for that agm next time

1806.64 --> 1812.3990000000001
you're banned

1809.039 --> 1815.2
yeah does it if that says organic

1812.399 --> 1815.6
on it does that mean that it actually

1815.2 --> 1818.799
has

1815.6 --> 1822.559
the checked food standard

1818.799 --> 1826.559
label no

1822.559 --> 1830.0
no it doesn't people can write organic

1826.559 --> 1833.039
on whatever the [ __ ] they want

1830.0 --> 1836.159
that's not organic if it says

1833.039 --> 1838.8799999999999
organic that doesn't mean it's organic

1836.159 --> 1840.48
it just means they wrote organic on it

1838.88 --> 1844.0
if something

1840.48 --> 1848.08
has an approved label

1844.0 --> 1851.2
then it has to show the approved

1848.08 --> 1854.24
label not say

1851.2 --> 1857.44
organic on it think

1854.24 --> 1857.44
with your brain

1861.36 --> 1867.519
right so

1864.48 --> 1868.32
let's see how do i know this is approved

1867.519 --> 1870.48
organic

1868.32 --> 1871.76
can you help me out here can you can you

1870.48 --> 1875.039
point out

1871.76 --> 1879.84
can you point it how do i know this

1875.039 --> 1883.44
is organic how do i know

1879.84 --> 1886.0
tell me in chat how do i know this

1883.44 --> 1886.799
is an officially european approved

1886.0 --> 1892.0
organic

1886.799 --> 1897.44
product does it say organic on it

1892.0 --> 1900.48
no it doesn't well how do i know then

1897.44 --> 1902.559
the top left symbol yes

1900.48 --> 1904.84
well not even directly but that's like

1902.559 --> 1906.559
the extra improved organic that's the

1904.84 --> 1909.6789999999999
diameter but that's

1906.559 --> 1914.96
like an extra seal of quality

1909.679 --> 1919.2
level now how do i know it by this

1914.96 --> 1922.64
this little green flag

1919.2 --> 1925.8400000000001
with the stars that's the officially

1922.64 --> 1928.64
approved organic seal

1925.84 --> 1930.799
if your product does not have this you

1928.64 --> 1931.1200000000001
can say whatever the [ __ ] you want about

1930.799 --> 1934.799
it

1931.12 --> 1938.1589999999999
it's not organic do you get it

1934.799 --> 1941.2
no green flag with stars

1938.159 --> 1943.0390000000002
not organic don't listen to whatever the

1941.2 --> 1945.6000000000001
[ __ ] the product says if it doesn't have

1943.039 --> 1948.0
the label it's not organic

1945.6 --> 1948.6399999999999
doesn't always mean it's bad right

1948.0 --> 1951.6
because

1948.64 --> 1952.48
it is tends to be kind of expensive so

1951.6 --> 1954.799
especially for

1952.48 --> 1956.559
say if you're like a farmer or something

1954.799 --> 1958.96
and you're kind of small time yeah you

1956.559 --> 1961.6
can't pay for that [ __ ] because it is

1958.96 --> 1962.24
yeah it costs extra it's annoying that

1961.6 --> 1963.84
way

1962.24 --> 1966.32
and understand like okay if you have

1963.84 --> 1970.0
like an apple

1966.32 --> 1972.399
archer and you're like damn i'm gonna

1970.0 --> 1973.6
make organic quality apples right i'm

1972.399 --> 1976.559
gonna do it all right

1973.6 --> 1977.1999999999998
even better but yeah i can't pay for

1976.559 --> 1979.36
that [ __ ]

1977.2 --> 1981.6000000000001
i can't pay for the labeling and all

1979.36 --> 1982.7199999999998
that so i'm just gonna say look this is

1981.6 --> 1984.799
organic grade

1982.72 --> 1988.24
i this is how i do it this is what i put

1984.799 --> 1991.2
into it this is how i farm it

1988.24 --> 1992.08
is it good for you well if you just ask

1991.2 --> 1996.48
pay attention

1992.08 --> 1996.48
go to the place know it then yeah

1999.519 --> 2002.799
yeah then you can research and know okay

2002.159 --> 2006.0800000000002
this is

2002.799 --> 2008.8799999999999
organic but it's not labeled organic

2006.08 --> 2010.799
that's right and then you just know okay

2008.88 --> 2012.3990000000001
he didn't have the label

2010.799 --> 2015.279
because he can't pay for it but it's

2012.399 --> 2017.279
still organic i had a farm

2015.279 --> 2018.559
in the south of the netherlands where we

2017.279 --> 2022.08
went to for

2018.559 --> 2025.039
all kinds of things eggs even meat

2022.08 --> 2026.799
that did not have the organic label

2025.039 --> 2027.6
because it was a really small farm it

2026.799 --> 2031.2
was just

2027.6 --> 2034.6399999999999
a farmer and his wife they had the best

2031.2 --> 2039.279
the best beef the best x you could

2034.64 --> 2041.44
ever imagine so good so good

2039.279 --> 2043.12
it was organic i knew it was organic you

2041.44 --> 2045.3600000000001
could see exactly how do we were

2043.12 --> 2047.6789999999999
they would show us the farm exactly what

2045.36 --> 2048.24
was could pick your own strawberries

2047.679 --> 2051.119
there

2048.24 --> 2052.879
in the season amazing place they

2051.119 --> 2054.48
couldn't pay for that freaking brand

2052.879 --> 2056.24
they didn't sell it to a wider

2054.48 --> 2057.2
supermarket chain no they just did it

2056.24 --> 2059.04
locally

2057.2 --> 2060.399
but i knew it was organic even though

2059.04 --> 2064.32
they didn't have the label

2060.399 --> 2067.1189999999997
why because i checked it out myself

2064.32 --> 2067.839
that's how you know right and if you

2067.119 --> 2069.9190000000003
can't do that

2067.839 --> 2072.0789999999997
and you're delivered to the wider food

2069.919 --> 2074.56
chain yeah you're going to

2072.079 --> 2076.2400000000002
have to either take wild gamble see what

2074.56 --> 2077.04
you like see what you like oh this is

2076.24 --> 2078.9599999999996
feel good

2077.04 --> 2080.879
or you're gonna have to trust on the

2078.96 --> 2084.879
label and not somebody

2080.879 --> 2089.839
writing organic on it and no label

2084.879 --> 2089.839
because then it's just a [ __ ] lie

2098.88 --> 2105.76
yeah no you don't have my permission to

2103.28 --> 2105.76
get back

2109.2 --> 2112.3999999999996
all right so that's uh

2112.8 --> 2120.2400000000002
that's about organic food yeah

2116.0 --> 2120.24
you don't like it get the [ __ ] out of

2128.839 --> 2133.359
here

2130.24 --> 2133.68
thank you seeds of doubt and thank you

2133.359 --> 2136.72
for

2133.68 --> 2136.72
bearing with me there

2136.8 --> 2142.6400000000003
i know can be pretty brutal to you guys

2140.88 --> 2146.1600000000003
even though you don't mean it sometimes

2142.64 --> 2148.72
i got pretty rough on tarik

2146.16 --> 2150.72
306 yesterday with uh have you looked

2148.72 --> 2152.8799999999997
into apples

2150.72 --> 2154.72
and i kind of hurt his feelings i think

2152.88 --> 2157.839
a little but he got over it

2154.72 --> 2159.9199999999996
because he's not a little [ __ ] and he

2157.839 --> 2161.44
actually appreciated what at the point

2159.92 --> 2164.88
that i tried to make

2161.44 --> 2167.119
after it so i hope

2164.88 --> 2169.119
you all do too with what i'm trying to

2167.119 --> 2173.76
say right now

2169.119 --> 2176.4

2173.76 --> 2176.4
you're awesome

2177.28 --> 2181.0400000000004
but the lesson still stands though i

2179.04 --> 2182.16
really want you to pay attention to what

2181.04 --> 2184.64
you're typing

2182.16 --> 2187.1189999999997
before you type enter i think that's

2184.64 --> 2189.68
like a personal thing with you

2187.119 --> 2189.6800000000003
so yeah

2209.92 --> 2214.32
with

2210.32 --> 2218.32

uh yeah that was so

2225.76 --> 2232.8
stop that for me [ __ ] oh

2229.52 --> 2234.72
that that piece that that piece needs to

2232.8 --> 2237.2000000000003
be sampled and that's like one of the

2234.72 --> 2239.5989999999997
best samples i've ever heard

2237.2 --> 2240.56
oh that's got to be a standard flat

2239.599 --> 2244.1600000000003
earth wrap

2240.56 --> 2257.839
sample it has to be it has to be that

2283.04 --> 2286.32
really weird but i think that in a

2284.32 --> 2286.6400000000003
direct in an indirect sense i've had

2286.32 --> 2289.3590000000004
this

2286.64 --> 2290.96
issue for like three years probably

2289.359 --> 2291.92
since the start of the early bird and i

2290.96 --> 2295.28
just thought like this

2291.92 --> 2297.52
is untenable who wants me to be

2295.28 --> 2298.96
like a really loud mouse super

2297.52 --> 2302.079
aggressive

2298.96 --> 2305.359
almost invasive personal attacking

2302.079 --> 2306.1600000000003
personal corrector it's like because i

2305.359 --> 2309.5989999999997
feel like i'm an

2306.16 --> 2312.16
[ __ ] when i do it but i can't

2309.599 --> 2312.6400000000003
not do it it's literally bad for my

2312.16 --> 2315.68
health

2312.64 --> 2319.2
not to do it i have to [ __ ] be this

2315.68 --> 2321.52
i have to be this i have to ram it

2319.2 --> 2324.0
violently down your throat when you make

2321.52 --> 2324.4
a stupid mistake i have to i must do

2324.0 --> 2327.52
this

2324.4 --> 2331.44
or it's gonna kill me it's gonna kill me

2327.52 --> 2332.72
if i don't do it i know it sounds so

2331.44 --> 2335.839
dramatic it's

2332.72 --> 2338.9599999999996
not joking i'm not joking i

2335.839 --> 2339.44
have to do it i have to be like this or

2338.96 --> 2341.839
it's gonna

2339.44 --> 2341.839
kill me

2342.64 --> 2346.4
because there is so much wrong with this

2345.28 --> 2348.5600000000004
world

2346.4 --> 2350.32
so many mistakes they have to be

2348.56 --> 2352.0
corrected nobody corrects

2350.32 --> 2354.079
each other's mistakes anymore

2352.0 --> 2358.4
everybody's just being a tolerant little

2354.079 --> 2362.079
[ __ ] stop doing it correct one another

2358.4 --> 2369.839
improve don't let it slide

2362.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
don't let it slide

2373.71 --> 2383.839
[Music]

2397.2 --> 2401.359
what gay show would you host

2402.24 --> 2404.7999999999997
joseph

2407.359 --> 2411.839

2452.96 --> 2456.8
smart ass

2465.599 --> 2470.319
don't tell me to calm the [ __ ] down

2467.599 --> 2471.2000000000003
nobody tells me to calm the [ __ ] down

2470.319 --> 2475.119
you hear me

2471.2 --> 2477.1189999999997

2477.119 --> 2480.8

2479.04 --> 2482.64
nathan

2480.8 --> 2484.0

2482.64 --> 2488.16

2484.0 --> 2495.839
i said no never and i meant it

2488.16 --> 2495.839

2497.839 --> 2502.96
nobody calls me chicken what

2504.88 --> 2509.839
are you a mcfly or something

2510.64 --> 2523.839

2533.52 --> 2538.56
yeah drunken bullet 411 gets me

2536.8 --> 2542.1600000000003
because that was the big flaw that was

2538.56 --> 2543.7599999999998
the big personal trial in the whole

2542.16 --> 2545.839
in the whole back to the future series

2543.76 --> 2550.2400000000002
that was his big trial

2545.839 --> 2553.7599999999998
that's where everything went wrong

2550.24 --> 2553.7599999999998
but it was used and all that [ __ ]

2556.48 --> 2563.04
oh really yeah i would and i have

2561.04 --> 2566.72
i've actually done that in the face of

2563.04 --> 2569.2799999999997
several people doing that to me

2566.72 --> 2569.2799999999997
that's right

2571.28 --> 2577.6800000000003
you see i might be a black dressed

2574.56 --> 2579.04
kind of small guy but if i kick you in

2577.68 --> 2581.44
the right time

2579.04 --> 2584.96
i can [ __ ] break your skull with a

2581.44 --> 2584.96
single hit you piece of [ __ ]

2585.599 --> 2592.0
yeah and i'm very good at aiming

2588.96 --> 2607.839
very good so go [ __ ] yourself

2592.0 --> 2607.839
you scumbag

2609.04 --> 2612.16
hey robert stanley

2614.8 --> 2618.0
yeah and don't you [ __ ] think you can

2616.4 --> 2620.8
sneak up on me because i can

2618.0 --> 2622.72
literally hear everything surrounding me

2620.8 --> 2626.96
with perfect precision

2622.72 --> 2626.9599999999996
i can blindly evade [ __ ]

2629.68 --> 2634.72
try me out but yeah know that if you try

2632.88 --> 2636.079
if you actually think you're a smart ass

2634.72 --> 2638.72
and you can get away with it

2636.079 --> 2639.76
i am going to make you end up in the

2638.72 --> 2642.319
hospital

2639.76 --> 2643.0400000000004
with pain that's going to last your

2642.319 --> 2645.2
entire

2643.04 --> 2646.839
lifetime and no surgeon can ever get

2645.2 --> 2649.0499999999997
away

2646.839 --> 2650.96
[ __ ] so yeah

2649.05 --> 2663.8390000000004
[Music]

2650.96 --> 2663.839
better be worth it

2674.88 --> 2677.839
okay

2679.839 --> 2687.359
how does that work i just have senses

2683.92 --> 2690.319
i have senses i have senses probably at

2687.359 --> 2692.56
300 percent of what the average human

2690.319 --> 2695.2799999999997
being has at this point

2692.56 --> 2697.119
because i was built for that i trained

2695.28 --> 2700.8
myself for that i fed myself

2697.119 --> 2703.76
very meticulously my entire life yes

2700.8 --> 2704.079
our martial arts i've done taekwondo for

2703.76 --> 2706.0
a

2704.079 --> 2708.2400000000002
significant amount of years in a very

2706.0 --> 2711.28
critical growth period of my life

2708.24 --> 2713.2799999999997
i'm a very good swimmer i've trained my

2711.28 --> 2715.2000000000003
reflexes and my balance i've trained my

2713.28 --> 2719.119
intuition on many levels

2715.2 --> 2721.5989999999997
mentally intuitively perceptively

2719.119 --> 2723.52
i can i've trained freaking dreaming

2721.599 --> 2726.1600000000003
okay i can [ __ ] control my dream

2723.52 --> 2728.56
so yeah you better damn well believe i

2726.16 --> 2731.04
can sense [ __ ]

2728.56 --> 2733.52
i can't sense [ __ ] you'll never [ __ ]

2731.04 --> 2735.359
know right i can sense people's

2733.52 --> 2737.68
feelings on a distance and they don't

2735.359 --> 2747.839
even have to see their face

2737.68 --> 2747.839
you got it

2758.839 --> 2762.88
uh

2761.2 --> 2764.64
yeah that's another type of sense it's a

2762.88 --> 2768.079
smell sense agm

2764.64 --> 2775.52
i bet you'll have plenty of those

2768.079 --> 2778.6400000000003
i bet you're a pretty big nosed guy

2775.52 --> 2781.7599999999998
no i shouldn't be an mma fighter

2778.64 --> 2784.8799999999997
i'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ] what you think

2781.76 --> 2788.2400000000002
i'm building all these senses

2784.88 --> 2791.52
and just to be constantly bashed an

2788.24 --> 2794.64
adult and tolerated and like

2791.52 --> 2796.8
worse [ __ ] by a bunch of [ __ ] retards

2794.64 --> 2798.56
and be like oh i'm so precious oh look

2796.8 --> 2800.8390000000004
at that look i'm so precious why i'm

2798.56 --> 2804.4
being bashed apart now if my senses are

2800.839 --> 2805.7599999999998
broken what you think i'm a [ __ ]

2804.4 --> 2808.2400000000002
not saying that all these people are

2805.76 --> 2811.0400000000004
retards by the way no offense men

2808.24 --> 2813.5989999999997
but yeah i'm not going to [ __ ] waste

2811.04 --> 2815.7599999999998
my precious senses and my faculties

2813.599 --> 2818.0
on just being popular and being bashed

2815.76 --> 2822.4
in the face a lot

2818.0 --> 2825.2
i don't even like fighting i just

2822.4 --> 2825.92
need to be able to laugh out extremely

2825.2 --> 2828.839
lethally

2825.92 --> 2831.04
if it's really necessary that's what i

2828.839 --> 2834.48
learned it's like okay

2831.04 --> 2837.119
okay i need to be absolutely

2834.48 --> 2837.68
[ __ ] lethal absolutely lethal it has

2837.119 --> 2840.7200000000003
no

2837.68 --> 2843.1189999999997
seconds notice seconds notice because

2840.72 --> 2844.16
i have a very dangerous level of

2843.119 --> 2846.8
intelligence

2844.16 --> 2847.7599999999998
and insight and spirit to defend against

2846.8 --> 2850.559
the [ __ ]

2847.76 --> 2852.7200000000003
devils in this world that will

2850.559 --> 2855.3590000000004
absolutely out of nowhere

2852.72 --> 2856.3999999999996
just start to attack you in the back

2855.359 --> 2859.2799999999997
because

2856.4 --> 2861.119
the demons will possess husks of people

2859.28 --> 2864.4
just to do that because they don't

2861.119 --> 2867.28
like the feel of me i need it

2864.4 --> 2869.2000000000003
and i need that i need to radiate that

2867.28 --> 2870.1600000000003
so that people don't actually do that

2869.2 --> 2873.2
because then they

2870.16 --> 2876.3999999999996
intuitively no i will [ __ ] break

2873.2 --> 2878.24
their necks if they try that

2876.4 --> 2880.2400000000002
yeah and if you think that's out of

2878.24 --> 2883.9199999999996
nowhere that's paranoia

2880.24 --> 2887.1189999999997
no no it's not because in my [ __ ]

2883.92 --> 2901.839
youth people actually did

2887.119 --> 2901.839
that to me okay

2919.76 --> 2926.2400000000002
yeah they did that to me even

2923.2 --> 2930.0
preteen they [ __ ] did that to me

2926.24 --> 2933.1189999999997
yeah so i had to one choice

2930.0 --> 2937.2
two choices one you let you become a

2933.119 --> 2940.1600000000003
[ __ ] rag doll pushed around

2937.2 --> 2941.2
battered slave [ __ ] the rest of your

2940.16 --> 2944.72
life probably end up

2941.2 --> 2947.9199999999996
gay just to seem less threatening

2944.72 --> 2952.16
or i'm gonna become a [ __ ] paladin

2947.92 --> 2957.839
and purify this [ __ ] world of demons

2952.16 --> 2957.839
i chose the latter

2972.0 --> 2975.119
hey robin stanley

2980.4 --> 2999.839
hmm gotta stop chugging these mints

3010.839 --> 3017.119
okay

3013.599 --> 3020.1600000000003
i'm so mean i'm so mean well

3017.119 --> 3023.28
you know if you had a youth

3020.16 --> 3027.1189999999997
where you were literally

3023.28 --> 3030.6400000000003
spit upon by entire classes of people

3027.119 --> 3032.96
20 people of your same age in school

3030.64 --> 3036.8799999999997
grounds that would line up in a row

3032.96 --> 3036.88
push you around spit on you

3037.92 --> 3044.559
like do disgusting things

3041.04 --> 3046.0
deprive everything you love at a regular

3044.559 --> 3047.44
basis

3046.0 --> 3050.0
and the teachers wouldn't even do

3047.44 --> 3052.48
anything about it

3050.0 --> 3054.0
until you ended up so embarrassed about

3052.48 --> 3057.599
yourself that you wouldn't even tell

3054.0 --> 3059.359
your parents anymore what do you think

3057.599 --> 3061.52
would happen to you

3059.359 --> 3063.359
eventually because that is my [ __ ]

3061.52 --> 3066.48
youth

3063.359 --> 3069.359
it is it is

3066.48 --> 3069.76
that's happened to me between the ages

3069.359 --> 3073.7599999999998
of

3069.76 --> 3077.0400000000004
8 and 12.

3073.76 --> 3079.5200000000004
i had a very very terrible time back

3077.04 --> 3082.319
then it was a giant challenge

3079.52 --> 3085.28
and that i took it as a challenge was

3082.319 --> 3088.16
probably the only reason i'm still alive

3085.28 --> 3090.7200000000003
because i did like a challenge it's just

3088.16 --> 3093.1189999999997
that it was completely insane and i felt

3090.72 --> 3095.68
alone and isolated

3093.119 --> 3096.48
and excluded constantly and manipulate

3095.68 --> 3098.64
because they

3096.48 --> 3099.52
noticed that i was desperate to be part

3098.64 --> 3101.52
of something

3099.52 --> 3103.839
and they would lure me in like oh if you

3101.52 --> 3105.839
just like oh you can become part of this

3103.839 --> 3108.4
all you have to do is this

3105.839 --> 3110.64
and then they [ __ ] you over and then

3108.4 --> 3114.559
they kick you in the corner again

3110.64 --> 3116.8799999999997
and again and again and again

3114.559 --> 3117.92
yeah yeah that's what happens that's

3116.88 --> 3120.48
what happens

3117.92 --> 3121.599
you turn into this or you [ __ ] kill

3120.48 --> 3125.68
yourself

3121.599 --> 3139.3590000000004
so yeah that's what happens [ __ ]

3125.68 --> 3142.24
deal with it

3139.359 --> 3142.24
dammit these mints

3145.599 --> 3149.119
right and if you think this is just some

3147.76 --> 3152.48
random story

3149.119 --> 3152.88
i'll bring my [ __ ] dad on and have

3152.48 --> 3156.64
him

3152.88 --> 3159.28
testify about it because that is real

3156.64 --> 3159.2799999999997
it's real

3161.2 --> 3168.7999999999997
i wish i had the photographs at hand

3166.079 --> 3169.92
because i do still have photographs like

3168.8 --> 3171.6800000000003
of myself

3169.92 --> 3173.599
from that school period you can see it

3171.68 --> 3176.8799999999997
on my face how [ __ ]

3173.599 --> 3179.44
miserable i am but also still

3176.88 --> 3180.8
pride you know you know one of these

3179.44 --> 3182.8
things

3180.8 --> 3184.48
oh and this is like oh my god this is

3182.8 --> 3187.119
gonna have squirt

3184.48 --> 3190.079
overkill so globbers get ready you're

3187.119 --> 3194.0
gonna squirt over this for weeks

3190.079 --> 3196.48
you know what really set it off at first

3194.0 --> 3199.359
of me being absolutely exercised from

3196.48 --> 3202.88
the rest of the groups

3199.359 --> 3205.839
because i really love my teddy bear

3202.88 --> 3208.8
and i took my teddy bear to school when

3205.839 --> 3211.68
i was eight

3208.8 --> 3212.48
and i violently defended him like i

3211.68 --> 3214.8799999999997
literally

3212.48 --> 3216.8
bashed people's face in if they tried to

3214.88 --> 3219.44
take him away from me

3216.8 --> 3221.3590000000004
right yeah that made me kind of weird

3219.44 --> 3224.48
yeah it made me like oh why

3221.359 --> 3227.2799999999997
do you stupid little kid yeah yeah

3224.48 --> 3229.04
but i really needed him because i was

3227.28 --> 3231.8390000000004
emotionally

3229.04 --> 3233.7599999999998
kind of like dependent i was very

3231.839 --> 3236.72
emotional back then

3233.76 --> 3237.76
and i was very insecure like that had a

3236.72 --> 3239.9199999999996
lot of feelings

3237.76 --> 3240.88
very little maneuvering room knowing

3239.92 --> 3243.92
what to do with it

3240.88 --> 3246.319
i couldn't let go i would be mortified

3243.92 --> 3248.64
at the time eventually of course let it

3246.319 --> 3250.96
go but it took a very long time for me

3248.64 --> 3251.68
unusually long and i'm not embarrassed

3250.96 --> 3254.64
about it

3251.68 --> 3254.96
but everybody else exorcized me because

3254.64 --> 3256.96
i

3254.96 --> 3259.04
started out like that because they were

3256.96 --> 3259.839
all oh we're cool kids oh we don't need

3259.04 --> 3262.24
that anymore

3259.839 --> 3264.0
we're not kids anymore we're gonna just

3262.24 --> 3268.0
pretend to be adults

3264.0 --> 3271.2
and be [ __ ] corrupted pieces of [ __ ]

3268.0 --> 3271.64
well i still had some feelings and just

3271.2 --> 3274.72
some

3271.64 --> 3276.96
imagination and [ __ ] eve

3274.72 --> 3278.3999999999996
despite constantly being bullied to

3276.96 --> 3281.839
death by people

3278.4 --> 3285.04
yeah yeah you know what

3281.839 --> 3286.5589999999997
you know what minder i still have the

3285.04 --> 3290.64
teddy bear

3286.559 --> 3294.0

3290.64 --> 3295.839
okay he's in the box sure he's in a box

3294.0 --> 3297.599
but i'll never throw him away

3295.839 --> 3298.96
ever and he's still whole he's not

3297.599 --> 3302.079
broken

3298.96 --> 3303.119
i'll show him you one day because that

3302.079 --> 3305.52
became the thing

3303.119 --> 3306.319
you know when everybody starts bullying

3305.52 --> 3309.119
you

3306.319 --> 3310.96
because you have your teddy bear you

3309.119 --> 3311.92
either throw him in the shredder burn

3310.96 --> 3314.96
him

3311.92 --> 3317.119
or you protect him with your life for

3314.96 --> 3321.839
the rest of your life

3317.119 --> 3321.839
that's what i did

3330.48 --> 3335.839
right i really appreciate the good

3332.48 --> 3335.839
comments here

3336.4 --> 3340.2400000000002
the boys that come in are wins face

3338.64 --> 3342.48
aggressively during high school

3340.24 --> 3344.16
regret it now no high school was a

3342.48 --> 3345.92
completely different period i'm really

3344.16 --> 3349.2799999999997
talking in between

3345.92 --> 3351.76
my eighth age of 8 and 12.

3349.28 --> 3352.6400000000003
that's not high school after that things

3351.76 --> 3354.4
changed

3352.64 --> 3357.2
i went to a completely different type of

3354.4 --> 3359.04
school very different type of mindset

3357.2 --> 3363.359
more intellectuals

3359.04 --> 3366.72
more yeah liberals that are actually

3363.359 --> 3369.52
like more social

3366.72 --> 3369.9199999999996
and the teachers kind of got me and they

3369.52 --> 3372.559
they

3369.92 --> 3374.079
respected that i also had very big

3372.559 --> 3377.0400000000004
intelligence because i was

3374.079 --> 3379.04
even back then very smart like i had

3377.04 --> 3380.079
philosophical discussions with adult

3379.04 --> 3383.839
when i was freaking

3380.079 --> 3387.04
six okay six

3383.839 --> 3389.68
six right

3387.04 --> 3391.2799999999997
right yeah well kids don't give a [ __ ]

3389.68 --> 3393.359
about that

3391.28 --> 3395.0400000000004
but after some point yeah there will be

3393.359 --> 3395.2799999999997
adults that will be like okay this kid

3395.04 --> 3397.119
is

3395.28 --> 3399.28
really freaking smart he's just very

3397.119 --> 3402.48
emotionally sensitive

3399.28 --> 3405.0400000000004
okay so yeah

3402.48 --> 3407.44
in when i was 12 to the other school the

3405.04 --> 3411.04
things really changed

3407.44 --> 3412.96
not all for the better but

3411.04 --> 3415.04
at least some for the better at least i

3412.96 --> 3418.7200000000003
got some peace of mind

3415.04 --> 3421.96
people kind of left me alone finally

3418.72 --> 3426.0789999999997
until the jesuit guy and then he

3421.96 --> 3430.2400000000002
absolutely [ __ ] me up one final time

3426.079 --> 3433.52
basically but not before i had a lot of

3430.24 --> 3434.9599999999996
time to calm the [ __ ] down at least and

3433.52 --> 3438.319
realize that i wouldn't have to

3434.96 --> 3440.319
exterminate the entirety of humanity

3438.319 --> 3442.64
because that would have happened if that

3440.319 --> 3443.44
[ __ ] between 8 and 12 would have

3442.64 --> 3445.44
continued

3443.44 --> 3447.44
eternally that would have happened i

3445.44 --> 3450.64
would have probably just become a

3447.44 --> 3453.52
absolutely vengeful murderer because

3450.64 --> 3454.24
yeah when everybody shits on you like

3453.52 --> 3457.599
that

3454.24 --> 3459.359
that's what you do nobody respects you

3457.599 --> 3463.2000000000003
and it's not some stupid

3459.359 --> 3464.88
fake news story blah blah blah politics

3463.2 --> 3468.16
oohs who said

3464.88 --> 3470.4
no no that's real sick bullying and when

3468.16 --> 3472.0789999999997
nobody [ __ ] does anything about it

3470.4 --> 3474.7200000000003
when they know they should

3472.079 --> 3476.079
when parents literally hear it's

3474.72 --> 3479.2
happening and they're like oh

3476.079 --> 3481.6800000000003
[ __ ] him let him kill himself

3479.2 --> 3482.64
when you hear parents of kids in the

3481.68 --> 3485.52
distance say

3482.64 --> 3486.72
no let him kill himself yeah yeah that's

3485.52 --> 3489.7599999999998
what happens to you

3486.72 --> 3491.9199999999996
that's what happens to you

3489.76 --> 3492.88
yeah that happened to me that sort of

3491.92 --> 3495.2000000000003
[ __ ]

3492.88 --> 3495.2000000000003
get it

3496.079 --> 3504.48
right but it ended eventually

3501.28 --> 3504.48
thank god it ended

3510.559 --> 3515.119
right so yeah a little dramatic no i'm

3513.44 --> 3516.64
not gonna destroy humility you know i'm

3515.119 --> 3517.6800000000003

[Music]

4545.84 --> 4550.8
that's a more subtle thing that you're

4548.159 --> 4550.799999999999
talking about

4551.12 --> 4555.04
yes do you think you can see the future

4552.88 --> 4558.56
in your dreams i know you talk about

4555.04 --> 4561.6
thing probably things that came true

4558.56 --> 4563.04
right spelling just do do

4561.6 --> 4564.719
check your chat spelling people i have

4563.04 --> 4565.84
the same problem my keyboard is really

4564.719 --> 4568.56
shitty

4565.84 --> 4570.719
like half the keys i need to like tap

4568.56 --> 4573.76
them three or four times before they go

4570.719 --> 4576.08
sometimes really annoying but just do it

4573.76 --> 4577.679
just do it don't leave that letter out

4576.08 --> 4579.84
of there just check what you write

4577.679 --> 4581.84
just please it doesn't matter if it

4579.84 --> 4584.400000000001
takes like 30 seconds longer it's so

4581.84 --> 4587.4400000000005
much better if you just do it right

4584.4 --> 4587.44
so please double check

4588.08 --> 4591.04
but yeah

4591.6 --> 4594.8
you think you see the future in dreams

4593.36 --> 4598.239
yes i can

4594.8 --> 4600.64
and i can see the past in dreams too

4598.239 --> 4603.199
my own past and i have actually like i

4600.64 --> 4605.52
have seen extra dimensional things

4603.199 --> 4606.32
like extra dimensional objects objects

4605.52 --> 4609.120000000001
that exist

4606.32 --> 4611.199
in dreams persistently so you dream

4609.12 --> 4611.76
about a place where you are in a certain

4611.199 --> 4614.0
time

4611.76 --> 4616.159000000001
you have the things in that room

4614.0 --> 4619.44
wherever that is

4616.159 --> 4621.5199999999995
and then you have extra things that

4619.44 --> 4623.919999999999
in your dream at the time you dream it's

4621.52 --> 4625.52
like whoa i got this amazing book i

4623.92 --> 4626.2390000000005
found i don't know where it came from

4625.52 --> 4628.0
look at this i

4626.239 --> 4629.599999999999
this looks like this and it looks like

4628.0 --> 4633.12
this

4629.6 --> 4634.4800000000005
and then 20 years later you have the

4633.12 --> 4636.88
dream that's like hey

4634.48 --> 4638.08
i dream i'm dreaming like i'm in my room

4636.88 --> 4641.1990000000005
again

4638.08 --> 4642.719
wow it's exactly like it was amazing my

4641.199 --> 4646.08
brother's there

4642.719 --> 4650.4
and whoa look it's that book again

4646.08 --> 4652.239
it's exactly the same book yeah

4650.4 --> 4654.239
yeah that happened to me yesterday was

4652.239 --> 4657.36
pretty astounding i literally

4654.239 --> 4660.718999999999
dreamt of designs

4657.36 --> 4663.28
that i still have i showed them and then

4660.719 --> 4664.2390000000005
designs that i never made that i dreamt

4663.28 --> 4666.96
back then

4664.239 --> 4668.799999999999
that i flicked through again absolutely

4666.96 --> 4672.8
astounding

4668.8 --> 4673.76
right as for future dreams yeah i've had

4672.8 --> 4675.6
that

4673.76 --> 4677.1990000000005
but then again with the dream world

4675.6 --> 4678.0
things can become quite complicated

4677.199 --> 4680.799999999999
especially when

4678.0 --> 4682.88
you are really traumatized and [ __ ] up

4680.8 --> 4685.04
and fearful

4682.88 --> 4686.159000000001
things can get things can get weird in

4685.04 --> 4688.159
dreams

4686.159 --> 4690.32
like i've been to sleep when i was

4688.159 --> 4690.799999999999
utterly traumatized and i thought my

4690.32 --> 4693.84
life's

4690.8 --> 4696.0
ended and when that happens really

4693.84 --> 4698.4800000000005
weird things can happen in my dreams

4696.0 --> 4701.04
like really weird things

4698.48 --> 4704.0
that's when i get projection type

4701.04 --> 4707.84
situations and dark world experiences

4704.0 --> 4711.679
and those have [ __ ] me up as a kid

4707.84 --> 4715.28
you can imagine because between 8 and 12

4711.679 --> 4718.0
i had a lot of them a lot

4715.28 --> 4720.639999999999
so much that i thought that i was living

4718.0 --> 4722.96
in two different worlds at the same time

4720.64 --> 4726.08
and one world told me to keep them

4722.96 --> 4731.44
absolutely secret for the outside world

4726.08 --> 4736.08
and i did that up until i was 21

4731.44 --> 4737.919999999999
roughly and then i blurted out help help

4736.08 --> 4740.239
they're they're they're trying to take

4737.92 --> 4742.159
me away i don't even know where that is

4740.239 --> 4743.759999999999
i've been to these places but i can't

4742.159 --> 4747.679
trace it how can this be

4743.76 --> 4747.679
i don't understand anymore help me

4747.84 --> 4751.12
yeah i i thought i'm going completely

4750.4 --> 4753.839999999999
insane

4751.12 --> 4756.4
and in retrospect yeah that's kind of

4753.84 --> 4759.679
plausible way to describe it

4756.4 --> 4760.08
but now i figured out holy [ __ ] i have

4759.679 --> 4764.32
these

4760.08 --> 4766.88
really freaky dream like

4764.32 --> 4769.12
dream related experiences that i call

4766.88 --> 4771.84
dark world experiences that

4769.12 --> 4773.92
run all throughout my life that are just

4771.84 --> 4775.92
more than just dreams and they are

4773.92 --> 4778.0
well prophetic it's like a big word

4775.92 --> 4781.04
because they're prophetic

4778.0 --> 4783.199
it's just they seem to transcend time

4781.04 --> 4786.48
and the entities therein are like

4783.199 --> 4790.08
transcend time transcendent and they

4786.48 --> 4793.5199999999995
and they want to have power over you

4790.08 --> 4796.88
with that foreknowledge it's very

4793.52 --> 4800.64
creepy and they are not nice they are

4796.88 --> 4803.28
never nice they're not necessarily

4800.64 --> 4806.719
brutally violent or anything but they

4803.28 --> 4806.719
are just never nice

4807.6 --> 4812.2390000000005
so yeah i've had plenty of that and i'm

4810.639 --> 4813.679
glad that i don't really have that

4812.239 --> 4815.759999999999
anymore

4813.679 --> 4818.0
and i think that it also kind of ended

4815.76 --> 4819.84
when i basically broke the silence on it

4818.0 --> 4822.48
i think that that is when it kind of

4819.84 --> 4825.12
when they scared away because i spoke

4822.48 --> 4825.12
out about it

4825.6 --> 4829.04
and then yeah that was i think when i

4828.239 --> 4832.32
was 21

4829.04 --> 4835.199
and then after that i basically had to

4832.32 --> 4836.48
completely rediscover myself and what is

4835.199 --> 4838.879999999999
reality actually

4836.48 --> 4839.919999999999
and that's why i took so long and that's

4838.88 --> 4841.679
why i've had

4839.92 --> 4843.76
a lot of trouble integrating with

4841.679 --> 4844.719
society and even getting normal jobs and

4843.76 --> 4846.56
[ __ ] and why i

4844.719 --> 4848.32
felt like i'm an i'm a reject i feel

4846.56 --> 4850.2390000000005
like a complete loser i'm super

4848.32 --> 4852.08
intelligent and i can't even

4850.239 --> 4853.759999999999
act like a normal human being among

4852.08 --> 4854.88
other humans and i can't have a normal

4853.76 --> 4858.4800000000005
job before

4854.88 --> 4859.6
without going nuts and i felt very

4858.48 --> 4861.919999999999
incompetent

4859.6 --> 4862.88
very bad about myself for a very long

4861.92 --> 4866.4
time

4862.88 --> 4870.2390000000005
well that's over i'm through it now

4866.4 --> 4874.08
i'm done and i'm i've leveled up

4870.239 --> 4877.28
i'm i'm a wizard now i've learned my

4874.08 --> 4880.5599999999995
lessons i've learned a lot of lessons

4877.28 --> 4883.199
way more than most can ever even figure

4880.56 --> 4883.1990000000005
out exist

4883.679 --> 4889.84
so i'm here and i'm gonna get my buns

4914.84 --> 4917.84
uh

4930.08 --> 4936.719
no earth passenger there is no best job

4932.56 --> 4940.320000000001
i ever had and i don't have a dream job

4936.719 --> 4940.32
this is my dream job

4940.719 --> 4945.84
other than that i like to think up

4943.76 --> 4948.0
things i like to be a think tank guy i

4945.84 --> 4950.2390000000005

5961.04 --> 5966.48
right but i'm getting distracted here

5964.4 --> 5968.0
but what he basically said was that

5966.48 --> 5971.119
apparently bob

5968.0 --> 5974.0
let it out of his mouth without even any

5971.119 --> 5977.36
sort of objection or regret

5974.0 --> 5981.36
but apparently child

5977.36 --> 5983.839999999999
rape victims don't have souls

5981.36 --> 5986.96
and don't even have a person are not

6006.84 --> 6013.4400000000005
huh

6009.84 --> 6014.2390000000005
and the weird thing is i think i even

6013.44 --> 6018.0
remembered him

6014.239 --> 6022.159
saying that life it just blotted it out

6018.0 --> 6024.32
of my mind

6022.159 --> 6027.679
so i i couldn't i couldn't listen to the

6060.08 --> 6064.8

6063.92 --> 6068.719

6064.8 --> 6072.08
skills are subpar and inept

6068.719 --> 6073.119
so [ __ ] off your fake ass psychology or

6072.08 --> 6076.84

what oh i have emotions oh no i'm can be

6123.28 --> 6127.44
irrational

6124.639 --> 6129.4400000000005
because you can never be rational

6127.44 --> 6131.599999999999
together with emotions right

6129.44 --> 6132.719
you can never be coherent if you

6131.6 --> 6136.88
experience the most

6132.719 --> 6139.28
what kind of a [ __ ] wussy are you man

6136.88 --> 6140.32
you're really a psychologist no you're a

6140.32 --> 6144.48
you you read a book written by a bunch

6142.96 --> 6148.0
of atheists

eugenics freaks

6148.0 --> 6153.84

[Music]

6188.84 --> 6191.84
this

6223.92 --> 6233.84
crap i'm still [ __ ] emotional

6235.04 --> 6241.5199999999995
just that that bob said that it it hurts

6238.32 --> 6241.5199999999995
me so much guys

6243.92 --> 6247.28
they all just let him do that and he

6246.0 --> 6251.52
never

6247.28 --> 6251.5199999999995
never even really apologized it's

6251.679 --> 6254.96
just let him do that

6256.4 --> 6261.839999999999
it's so disgusting

[Music]

6271.64 --> 6274.81
[Music]

6283.28 --> 6286.5599999999995
what do i think about jesus as a

6285.28 --> 6290.32
metaphor

6286.56 --> 6290.320000000001
of our internal connection to god

6291.36 --> 6294.4
uh no

6298.8 --> 6305.679
it's not a metaphor

6302.0 --> 6307.84
but there is an esoteric essence to it

6305.679 --> 6309.04
oh that's kind of double so it's

6307.84 --> 6311.360000000001
esoteric

6309.04 --> 6312.32
jesus to me is esoteric it's very

6311.36 --> 6315.04
complicated

6312.32 --> 6317.36
jesus is the most complicated subject in

6315.04 --> 6320.6
the [ __ ] world

6317.36 --> 6323.679
literally it's almost

6320.6 --> 6324.8
paradoxical level complicated but it's a

6323.679 --> 6328.159
paradox

6324.8 --> 6330.719
that is absolutely true yeah how do you

6328.159 --> 6333.36
[ __ ] explain that

6330.719 --> 6335.36
yeah that's the best way i can quickly

6333.36 --> 6337.839999999999
describe it

6335.36 --> 6337.839999999999
jesus

6338.48 --> 6347.44
is the ultimate paradox that is real

6344.8 --> 6351.04
yeah and i know just on the top of that

6347.44 --> 6351.04
that makes no [ __ ] sense and that's

6351.119 --> 6357.199
it's real though but what does that mean

6355.52 --> 6360.159000000001
yeah well most people don't even

6357.199 --> 6360.159
understand that so

6361.04 --> 6364.4
all right i did though when i was

6363.04 --> 6368.239
[ __ ] five

6364.4 --> 6373.839999999999
i said it when i was five

6368.239 --> 6373.839999999999
five yeah i told my parents

6373.92 --> 6378.4800000000005
god doesn't exist but he's there

6379.04 --> 6385.76
yeah when i was five

6382.719 --> 6388.08
i never really understood

6385.76 --> 6390.88
what i actually understood back then

6388.08 --> 6390.88
what i do now

6397.92 --> 6401.52
but yeah to me the way that i describe

6400.719 --> 6404.32
jesus

6401.52 --> 6405.84
right now i don't really care too much

6404.32 --> 6408.719
about history

6405.84 --> 6411.360000000001
or details or did he ever live it's

6408.719 --> 6413.6
actually another person

6411.36 --> 6414.88
time doesn't even go back that far no

6413.6 --> 6418.08
it's all wrong and

6414.88 --> 6420.96
the jesuits and everything changed

6418.08 --> 6421.76
everything but jesus can just be as it

6420.96 --> 6425.44
is

6421.76 --> 6428.2390000000005
everything but everything but unless you

6425.44 --> 6429.44
blind faith and it doesn't matter what

6428.239 --> 6432.4
anybody says

6429.44 --> 6433.28
the bible is absolute truth and you must

6432.4 --> 6436.4
believe

6433.28 --> 6440.0
blindly or you go to hell see

6436.4 --> 6440.0
it's both [ __ ]

6440.84 --> 6444.7300000000005
yes

6443.679 --> 6447.9400000000005
it's true

6444.73 --> 6447.94
[Music]

6451.199 --> 6458.48
your mind still working

6454.4 --> 6461.199
because mine has some trouble with that

6458.48 --> 6461.199
it is though

6463.92 --> 6469.36
right but what i know is is that

6467.04 --> 6471.199
i've read what i've heard from jesus

6469.36 --> 6473.199
when people speak about jesus when they

6471.199 --> 6475.28
speak about the bible in relation to

6473.199 --> 6475.759999999999
jesus when other people in the bible

6475.28 --> 6479.119
speak

6475.76 --> 6482.2390000000005
about jesus one thing becomes

6479.119 --> 6487.44
very apparent to me through my intuition

6482.239 --> 6492.239
now this is a frequency and a method

6487.44 --> 6495.919999999999
and a nature of creation

6492.239 --> 6499.28
and that that in the end to me

6495.92 --> 6502.56
is what christ is

6499.28 --> 6505.679
it's the principles the method

6502.56 --> 6509.04
and the nature and the spirit of

6505.679 --> 6512.2390000000005
god how did

6509.04 --> 6514.639
he intend to

6512.239 --> 6516.239
design things how did he intend the

6514.639 --> 6518.8
things he had designed to

6516.239 --> 6518.799999999999
unroll

6519.36 --> 6527.599999999999
the optimum the optimus

6523.36 --> 6531.839999999999
the the perfection the intended

6527.6 --> 6534.4800000000005
creation the powers within every part

6531.84 --> 6536.639
of creation within time within every

6534.48 --> 6539.04
combination within every crossover

6536.639 --> 6542.32
within every accident

6539.04 --> 6546.239
everything the entirety of creation

6542.32 --> 6549.599999999999
what is the best way

6546.239 --> 6553.28
christ's way the path of christ the

6549.6 --> 6556.96
middle road the way through

6553.28 --> 6556.96
the narrow path

6558.159 --> 6569.839999999999
that is what christ is to me

[Music]

6589.19 --> 6592.2699999999995
[Music]

6594.84 --> 6597.84
so

6598.08 --> 6603.84
and of course the great mystery of the

6605.599 --> 6610.0
yeah of what the [ __ ] like from the more

6608.4 --> 6614.0
internal christians say

6610.0 --> 6617.44
which i have some contemplation about of

6614.0 --> 6621.04
basically the living god come to earth

6617.44 --> 6623.28
that sacrificed himself to change

6621.04 --> 6624.8
the functionality of how things work in

6623.28 --> 6626.88
the world

6624.8 --> 6628.56
right to change the plan to change the

6626.88 --> 6631.119
rules

6628.56 --> 6632.320000000001
as part of it by taking on the sin with

6631.119 --> 6636.839999999999
his death

6632.32 --> 6639.28
within a flawless life or perceived as

6636.84 --> 6641.1990000000005
such

6639.28 --> 6644.0
there's something really freaking

6641.199 --> 6646.32
mysterious about that

6644.0 --> 6647.199
more than just no it's just that it's

6646.32 --> 6649.5199999999995
just that just

6647.199 --> 6653.119
memorize those sentences just like that

6649.52 --> 6656.4800000000005
no no no there is something

6653.119 --> 6659.839999999999
there's something really bizarre

6656.48 --> 6663.04
that's there and i have kind of

6659.84 --> 6666.719
curiosities about it more and more

6663.04 --> 6668.56
like and i don't wish to blaspheme so

6666.719 --> 6671.199
please don't take it as such

6668.56 --> 6672.96
please christianity i love christ i'll

6671.199 --> 6674.879999999999
die for christ

6672.96 --> 6676.719
like i'm at the point where i don't even

6674.88 --> 6678.400000000001
care whether he was real or not i

6676.719 --> 6681.28
believe in him anyway

6678.4 --> 6682.0
do you understand i don't care whether

6681.28 --> 6684.8
christ

6682.0 --> 6685.679
was actually historically real or not i

6684.8 --> 6689.4400000000005
believe

6685.679 --> 6692.719
in him and the path anyway

6689.44 --> 6695.36
understand this it's a clear

6692.719 --> 6696.96
clear i can't say it any more clear

6695.36 --> 6700.159
right

6696.96 --> 6703.52
but i think that maybe the story in

6700.159 --> 6705.759999999999
itself how it was eventually written

6703.52 --> 6707.1990000000005
might have been a cover story for

6705.76 --> 6711.1990000000005
something much

6707.199 --> 6714.5599999999995
grander even and much more insane

6711.199 --> 6716.159
and much more dramatic but i can't

6714.56 --> 6719.360000000001
really confirm it

6716.159 --> 6721.44
it's just that it just keeps seeping

6719.36 --> 6723.839999999999
into my mind every now and then and it's

6721.44 --> 6727.119
just freaks me out also

6723.84 --> 6729.52
because consider just a consideration of

6727.119 --> 6733.28
mine experiment don't take this

6729.52 --> 6736.88
literal at least not yet

6733.28 --> 6738.159
and just don't just consider it what if

6736.88 --> 6741.36
god

6738.159 --> 6742.239
like the first creator the one the

6741.36 --> 6744.5599999999995
nephilim

6742.239 --> 6745.44
the one that actually put the world

6744.56 --> 6747.92
together that

6745.44 --> 6750.159
actually was there when adam and eve got

6747.92 --> 6753.36
out of the paradise

6750.159 --> 6756.638999999999
that actually sat there in heaven

6753.36 --> 6760.0
on the throne delegating things as a

6756.639 --> 6760.0
physical entity

6760.48 --> 6767.119
what if it was him that actually

6764.0 --> 6771.28
died what if god

6767.119 --> 6774.88
himself the original creator the being

6771.28 --> 6774.88
that shaped the world

6775.08 --> 6782.639
sacrificed himself

6778.4 --> 6786.879999999999
in humility to prevent

6782.639 --> 6786.88
the ultimate destruction of humanity

6787.28 --> 6793.84
and what if his very design

6790.48 --> 6796.879999999999
of the world from the beginning on was

6793.84 --> 6800.4800000000005
even accounting for that

6796.88 --> 6803.4400000000005
so much that he basically designed

6800.48 --> 6805.598999999999
all things into as far as life and all

6803.44 --> 6806.719
existence can go all creational physical

6805.599 --> 6810.400000000001
creation

6806.719 --> 6812.719
that it was already accounted for

6810.4 --> 6815.199
that he the physical being that could

6812.719 --> 6817.36
physically alter the design potentially

6815.199 --> 6818.32
would no longer physically be there

6817.36 --> 6821.44
alive

6818.32 --> 6823.599
to do it that it was not necessary for

6821.44 --> 6825.199
him as a physical being the original

6823.599 --> 6829.04
creator of all things

6825.199 --> 6832.08
to basically physically be alive anymore

6829.04 --> 6834.96
what if that is actually what

6832.08 --> 6836.639
the christ crucifixion death story the

6834.96 --> 6839.76
death of the god

6836.639 --> 6841.4800000000005
is for it's

6839.76 --> 6843.679
when you think it like that it's just

6841.48 --> 6846.879999999999
unbelievably tragic and

6843.679 --> 6850.56
spooky and then maybe

6846.88 --> 6853.28
the simpler version of a christ story

6850.56 --> 6854.320000000001
might be a good metaphor to make people

6853.28 --> 6858.679
kind of understand

6854.32 --> 6862.159
why the spirit of it why because it's so

6858.679 --> 6863.1990000000005
unbelievably massive to imagine that the

6862.159 --> 6868.4
creator the

6863.199 --> 6871.199
physical being of creation itself

6868.4 --> 6873.92
would sacrifice himself for his own

6871.199 --> 6873.919999999999
creation

6874.719 --> 6882.4
not send somebody to die

6877.84 --> 6884.96
to do that no that the original one

6882.4 --> 6884.96
did it

6885.76 --> 6888.88
for his creation

6889.28 --> 6894.08
what do you think about that guys leave

6891.599 --> 6894.08
a comment

6895.44 --> 6900.4
it's just a thought but if it was

6898.88 --> 6902.0
anything like that then i would

6900.4 --> 6904.239
understand

6902.0 --> 6905.679
why the christ cover story would have

6904.239 --> 6907.839999999999
been made

6905.679 --> 6910.8
because it's too much most people can't

6907.84 --> 6910.8
handle that [ __ ]

6916.48 --> 6933.839999999999
what do you think i'm i'm gonna run out

6919.84 --> 6933.84
the show soon anyway

6943.04 --> 6946.96
now i'm not asking you about the power

6945.199 --> 6949.28
of of course the power of the creator's

6946.96 --> 6950.719
mind blowing he literally designed from

6949.28 --> 6954.0
scratch into in

6950.719 --> 6957.04
into infinity or into

6954.0 --> 6958.84
yeah the physical limitation possibility

6957.04 --> 6961.36
all things so yeah of course it's

6958.84 --> 6964.96
mind-blowing it's beyond mind-blowing

6961.36 --> 6966.719
that's not it's not to enforce respect

6964.96 --> 6968.719
of the creator that i just said that i

6966.719 --> 6972.56
just said it as the concept and

6968.719 --> 6972.88
why the christ cover could potentially

6972.56 --> 6975.76
be

6972.88 --> 6976.56
a cover story for it what do you think

6975.76 --> 6978.639
about that

6976.56 --> 6980.96
guys i i put it down with some

6978.639 --> 6982.88
hesitation i really want you to

wow look at the 63 down votes

7061.599 --> 7074.400000000001
that's amazing

7072.719 --> 7076.159
thank you earth passenger do you have

7074.4 --> 7078.159
any comments on the last

7076.159 --> 7079.679
thing that i said that i specifically

7078.159 --> 7087.839999999999
asked about

7079.679 --> 7087.84
you tara 306.

7089.679 --> 7095.28
that's very cute but that's not what i

7092.96 --> 7095.28
asked

7095.92 --> 7099.4400000000005
and i don't know if he's not a

7097.28 --> 7100.4
historical figure there's actually signs

7099.44 --> 7103.759999999999
that there were

7100.4 --> 7109.36
even two jesus people

7103.76 --> 7109.360000000001
historically so that's not what i

7112.84 --> 7116.639
asked

7114.4 --> 7119.5199999999995
thank you bobby stills i still would

7116.639 --> 7119.52
like a comment

7123.28 --> 7127.84
all right samson i do absolutely

7125.76 --> 7128.8
appreciate i know you're a very smart

7127.84 --> 7131.84
person

7128.8 --> 7134.88
and i know that when you say that

7131.84 --> 7134.88
that means something

7135.599 --> 7138.4800000000005
here we go again

7138.639 --> 7143.84
thank you

7152.8 --> 7157.04
right but yeah just for the record for

7155.84 --> 7161.28
everything i put down

7157.04 --> 7164.0
again it doesn't matter to me

7161.28 --> 7165.28
whether jesus jesus christ jesus

7164.0 --> 7168.56
nazareth

7165.28 --> 7171.199
was a real historical

7168.56 --> 7171.76
human being that supposedly did all

7171.199 --> 7176.08
these

7171.76 --> 7178.8
literal things it doesn't matter to me

7176.08 --> 7179.119
doesn't matter to me if he ever existed

7178.8 --> 7182.88
i

7179.119 --> 7184.88
still believe in him and what that means

7182.88 --> 7186.0
is i believe in everything that's

7184.88 --> 7189.36
written everything that

7186.0 --> 7192.32
i heard of him heard him say

7189.36 --> 7194.48
other people said of it that is the real

7192.32 --> 7196.88
thing that spirit it's the spirit it's

7194.48 --> 7200.159
the essence it's the frequency it's the

7196.88 --> 7203.4400000000005
path it's the way through

7200.159 --> 7205.36
that is jesus christ to me

7203.44 --> 7206.638999999999
it doesn't matter whether he was a

7205.36 --> 7209.679
living person

7206.639 --> 7214.8
once it doesn't matter to me

7209.679 --> 7214.8
i believe in him so you take that in

7224.84 --> 7229.28
mind

7227.44 --> 7232.239
are you saying that you think it might

7229.28 --> 7232.239
be an archetype

7234.639 --> 7241.84
no i think that

7238.56 --> 7241.84
maybe the creator

7243.28 --> 7247.44
was just not born in a village and grew

7246.96 --> 7250.719
up

7247.44 --> 7251.598999999999
but he just came exactly looking like

7250.719 --> 7254.639
jesus

7251.599 --> 7259.679
and he always did look like jesus maybe

7254.639 --> 7259.679
and he just came there and he just

7260.08 --> 7264.239
yeah he he chose to live like a man and

7263.28 --> 7267.36
basically

7264.239 --> 7270.959999999999
discard his eternal powers

7267.36 --> 7274.32
just for this something like that see

7270.96 --> 7278.719
it's like a god approaches the armies

7274.32 --> 7281.199
and just says no i have the power to

7278.719 --> 7281.76
instantly vaporize every single one of

7281.199 --> 7284.96
you

7281.76 --> 7287.280000000001
instantly and i will not do it

7284.96 --> 7287.28
that

7288.08 --> 7297.84
something like that

7306.08 --> 7309.44
oh yeah well lumi ki i'm sorry that

7308.4 --> 7311.92
you're too

7309.44 --> 7313.759999999999
simple-minded to understand the grand

7311.92 --> 7317.1990000000005
this the grandocity

7313.76 --> 7320.320000000001
grandiosity of such a scenario

7317.199 --> 7322.638999999999
and that's probably why the jesus christ

7320.32 --> 7324.4
story is much more tannable

7322.639 --> 7326.32
that's the whole point so yeah i just

7324.4 --> 7328.96
expect this i expect this there's a lot

7326.32 --> 7331.04
of people it makes no sense

7328.96 --> 7339.84
yeah i don't give a [ __ ] buddy don't

7331.04 --> 7339.84
give a [ __ ]

7342.48 --> 7346.239
he should do it this place is a disaster

7344.719 --> 7350.0
well

7346.239 --> 7352.48
i'm correct with my assessment

7350.0 --> 7353.199
then he's not there anymore to do it

7352.48 --> 7357.04
there is

7353.199 --> 7360.0
nobody left to do that

7357.04 --> 7360.0
there's just the

7361.119 --> 7367.759999999999
the the grips the mechanisms

7364.159 --> 7368.719
left that the creator used as part of

7367.76 --> 7371.1990000000005
the design

7368.719 --> 7372.159
that he made to interface and apply his

7371.199 --> 7374.5599999999995
powers with

7372.159 --> 7375.759999999999
that people can basically attempt to

7374.56 --> 7378.8
abuse through

7375.76 --> 7382.08
magic and dark [ __ ] that's what's left

7378.8 --> 7386.320000000001
i think that's what's giving so much

7382.08 --> 7388.96
trouble but i don't think that

7386.32 --> 7390.88
yeah if i if i were correct then it yeah

7388.96 --> 7393.04
it sounds really horrific it would mean

7390.88 --> 7396.159000000001
that god is dead

7393.04 --> 7399.199
but he cannot really die because he

7396.159 --> 7399.679
is creation as well it's just that the

7399.199 --> 7403.5199999999995
body

7399.679 --> 7405.679
that did it is dead something like that

7403.52 --> 7407.76
it's it's weird man but again it's a

7405.679 --> 7408.0
mind experiment i don't know for sure

7407.76 --> 7411.92
it's

7408.0 --> 7411.92
just an idea that's popping in there and

7414.4 --> 7417.598999999999
like yeah god is dead but he can't be

7417.04 --> 7420.159
dead

7417.599 --> 7422.8
because it's still there you can still

7420.159 --> 7425.44
hear him he's it's still there

7422.8 --> 7427.28
like death doesn't mean anything to

7425.44 --> 7430.32
something that created all things

7427.28 --> 7430.88
and time itself you see but it's still

7430.32 --> 7433.92
true

7430.88 --> 7435.119
then so yeah paradox paradox the [ __ ]

7433.92 --> 7438.0
out of the place

7435.119 --> 7438.32
god doesn't exist but he's not there

7438.0 --> 7440.32
he's

7438.32 --> 7441.599
or he's there it's a c see i said it

7440.32 --> 7445.199
when i was five

7441.599 --> 7447.4400000000005
five ah

7445.199 --> 7449.759999999999
god is not there but he exists but it's

7447.44 --> 7465.839999999999
not there

7449.76 --> 7465.84
said it when i was five

7468.239 --> 7472.799999999999
the ontological argument no no it's not

7470.4 --> 7475.759999999999
an ontological argument

7472.8 --> 7479.84
not really because it still has to be

7475.76 --> 7479.84
created no matter what

7486.8 --> 7492.0
right that's a good one delay fila

7489.679 --> 7494.88
elfinor double meaning although that's

7492.0 --> 7496.96
that's like downsizing it the the bible

7494.88 --> 7499.04
has so many different parallel meanings

7496.96 --> 7500.8
it's unbelievable

7499.04 --> 7502.159
i don't think there's a limit to the

7500.8 --> 7505.599
amount of

7502.159 --> 7507.119
context angles to reading it

7505.599 --> 7508.719
in which it is true i don't think

7507.119 --> 7511.92
there's a limit to it i think that the

7508.719 --> 7515.76
bible is not really a normal

7511.92 --> 7519.4400000000005
human-made book maybe written down by

7515.76 --> 7521.76
humans but it was definitely not

7519.44 --> 7523.44
like there were some there was something

7521.76 --> 7524.56
there was probably like the spirit of

7523.44 --> 7526.799999999999
god of angels

7524.56 --> 7535.84
something incredible involved it's not

7526.8 --> 7535.84
normal human work

7551.199 --> 7554.239
a question for you how would you go good

7553.199 --> 7556.239
for you for this

7554.239 --> 7557.5199999999995
evil one reveal the other word is free

7556.239 --> 7560.839999999999
with him

7557.52 --> 7563.84
yeah well why don't you

7560.84 --> 7563.84
ask

7564.239 --> 7567.839999999999
your 5 000 year old bloodline of

7566.239 --> 7570.32
ancestors they've been asking that

7567.84 --> 7573.1990000000005
question for 5 000 years

7570.32 --> 7576.88
so let's not address that right now if

7573.199 --> 7580.5599999999995
you don't mind samson

7576.88 --> 7591.84

man i need to round out the show but i

7602.4 --> 7605.839999999999

7860.56 --> 7863.360000000001
nowhere out of

7861.679 --> 7865.119
nowhere and just have a nice

7863.36 --> 7867.28
conversation just suddenly start to

7865.119 --> 7870.239
brutally verbally attack people

7867.28 --> 7870.639
for no damn reason just really calling

7870.239 --> 7873.759999999999
them

7870.639 --> 7877.119
absolutely disgusting horrific things

7873.76 --> 7879.84
out of nowhere when they never even

7877.119 --> 7880.719
talk bad about anyone this guy is a

7879.84 --> 7884.0
[ __ ]

7880.719 --> 7887.119
psychopath like really

7884.0 --> 7890.56
psycho not a like a bad mood guy that's

7887.119 --> 7892.799999999999
for example like dell you know dell

7890.56 --> 7894.719
he's not like that but dell gets like

7892.8 --> 7896.639
really moody sometimes

7894.719 --> 7898.56
right he's like that right well you know

7896.639 --> 7901.1990000000005
that that's just delhi radiate that this

7898.56 --> 7902.96
guy is like

7901.199 --> 7904.239
just you can't even read his feeling

7902.96 --> 7907.36
because he is a

7904.239 --> 7910.718999999999
literal psychopath like worse

7907.36 --> 7912.239
he's like born like that or super damage

7910.719 --> 7916.719
i don't know man but he is an

7912.239 --> 7919.28
actual psychopath totally insane

7916.719 --> 7920.4
and paranoid delusional that literally

7919.28 --> 7924.32
thinks

7920.4 --> 7927.44
god approached him and told him that

7924.32 --> 7930.48
everybody in the world is demons

7927.44 --> 7934.799999999999
to come after him and only he

7930.48 --> 7941.839999999999
is the good guy psychopath

7934.8 --> 7941.84
totally [ __ ] insane

7945.199 --> 7948.48
that's what you get when you interface

7947.52 --> 7952.079000000001
with spirits

7948.48 --> 7955.44
when you trust other things huh

7952.079 --> 7957.44
huh jason is it nice there in hell

7955.44 --> 7960.0
i know you're burning there right now as

7957.44 --> 7962.079
this demon is possessing your husk

7960.0 --> 7963.84
that is desperately trying to assert its

7962.079 --> 7967.36
power over everything

7963.84 --> 7968.0
i know it is i know how is it there in

7967.36 --> 7970.159
hell

7968.0 --> 7971.28
where your actual remnant of spirit is

7970.159 --> 7974.159
that's probably gone along

7971.28 --> 7976.239
how is it there in a birdering

7974.159 --> 7978.079
smoldering hell

7976.239 --> 7979.598999999999
yeah i can feel you there i can

7978.079 --> 7982.32
literally

7979.599 --> 7984.400000000001
i i don't it doesn't matter that you're

7982.32 --> 7987.84
in america or whatever

7984.4 --> 7988.879999999999
i can transcend space and time just like

7987.84 --> 7994.400000000001
that

7988.88 --> 7994.400000000001
with my spirit i know you're in hell

7995.28 --> 7999.84
and i know that you probably deserve to

7996.96 --> 7999.84
be there as well

7999.93 --> 8004.56
[Music]

8001.36 --> 8004.5599999999995
but yeah

8007.28 --> 8011.119
it's good of you to show up so that i

8009.28 --> 8016.4
can remind everybody

8011.119 --> 8016.4
who you really are a [ __ ] psychopath

8016.96 --> 8025.199
really disgusting creepy narcissistic

8020.8 --> 8025.1990000000005
dumb dumb as [ __ ]

8036.84 --> 8039.84
psychopath

8047.679 --> 8051.52
what are you eating are when they got a

8049.52 --> 8054.4800000000005
filler no i'm just being weird i'm

8051.52 --> 8054.4800000000005
hollowing out the bun

8054.96 --> 8058.079
i know it's kind of weird to eat all

8056.639 --> 8060.88
that in front of the mic

8058.079 --> 8062.48
i know it's just i don't give a [ __ ] i'm

8060.88 --> 8067.02
just doing whatever the [ __ ] i want

8062.48 --> 8071.8589999999995
right now

8067.02 --> 8071.859
[Music]

8071.92 --> 8081.84
and i am enjoying it indeed

8084.48 --> 8087.75
[Music]

8088.48 --> 8094.079
what kind of role you're eating it's not

8090.48 --> 8097.598999999999
a roll it's a bun

8094.079 --> 8100.079
and it's a yeah

8097.599 --> 8102.0
like one of the square bread thingies

8100.079 --> 8104.639
with

8102.0 --> 8105.76
pumpkin seeds on them and a little

8104.639 --> 8107.679
cheese sprinkles

8105.76 --> 8109.04
and i put them in the oven it's great

8107.679 --> 8111.76
love it

8109.04 --> 8111.76
very nice

8120.56 --> 8123.84
god it's hot

8124.0 --> 8127.199
i forget it's like oh wait it's not like

8126.48 --> 8129.759999999999
ginger

8127.199 --> 8137.839999999999
lemonade no it's just pure ginger juice

8129.76 --> 8137.84
it's freaking hot

8139.72 --> 8142.85
[Music]

8158.72 --> 8161.859
[Music]

8162.84 --> 8165.92
hmm

8164.32 --> 8167.84
if you can't stand the heat choose

8165.92 --> 8170.4800000000005
another kitchen forever

8167.84 --> 8173.119000000001
that's now that's a good joke again i

8170.48 --> 8173.119
like that one

8175.679 --> 8193.84
that's really smart i like that

8195.83 --> 8201.439
[Music]

8197.519 --> 8207.84
hmm go down the sun is down

8201.439 --> 8207.84
i miss it already

8212.96 --> 8216.559
it's gonna get dark pretty quick

8217.359 --> 8221.84
probably already in about 30 minutes

8238.479 --> 8243.358999999999
right anyway please by the way if you're

8241.599 --> 8249.84
gonna leave or anything don't forget the

8243.359 --> 8249.84
rogens it up

8252.96 --> 8256.08
white out here hmm

8256.399 --> 8260.559
right well if it's white then at least

8258.639 --> 8262.479
it's not going to be as cold

8260.559 --> 8265.119999999999
because these types of skies do tend to

8262.479 --> 8268.399
get pretty damn cold at night

8265.12 --> 8277.84
in the middle of the winter i'm not

8268.399 --> 8277.84
really enjoying all this cold too much

8279.359 --> 8286.800000000001
oh well at least i got a nice hot shower

8283.28 --> 8286.800000000001
to warm up if i wanted to

8289.439 --> 8291.84
hmm

8318.719 --> 8327.039999999999
okay that's interesting delay fila

8322.8 --> 8328.8
elfinor i'd like to talk to you about

8327.04 --> 8330.639000000001
philosophy of the bible found some

8328.8 --> 8332.96
curious analogies which talk about flat

8330.639 --> 8335.679
earthers of infinite plane

8332.96 --> 8337.518999999998
right well again physically that's

8335.679 --> 8341.359
impossible

8337.519 --> 8344.960000000001
so yeah that remains a physical

8341.359 --> 8348.479000000001
yeah physics fact physicality

8344.96 --> 8352.24
is physically impossible or if

8348.479 --> 8354.639
i mean infinity is physic is physically

8352.24 --> 8356.639
impossible right you got to take that it

8354.639 --> 8357.598999999998
doesn't really matter if the bible says

8356.639 --> 8360.08
something

8357.599 --> 8361.439
if you interpret it in that fashion

8360.08 --> 8364.639
you're wrong

8361.439 --> 8368.16
because there is no infinity in

8364.639 --> 8373.759999999998
physical nature it's impossible

8368.16 --> 8373.76
right but if you consider

8374.08 --> 8380.639
you basically but all the aspects

8377.84 --> 8382.0
might be infinite let's say it like

8380.639 --> 8384.24
passability

8382.0 --> 8386.88
how much you can move in one direction

8384.24 --> 8390.0
that might be infinite

8386.88 --> 8391.679999999998
but only if it's looping

8390.0 --> 8394.72
and you end up at the same place and

8391.68 --> 8397.28
then you can go by that route

8394.72 --> 8398.96
for all eternity for as long as you can

8397.28 --> 8401.28
move

8398.96 --> 8402.16
that's basically moving over an infinite

8401.28 --> 8405.439
plane it's the

8402.16 --> 8405.84
same piece of plane you will infinitely

8405.439 --> 8409.28
move

8405.84 --> 8412.960000000001
over because there is no

8409.28 --> 8416.0
infinite surface there is no

8412.96 --> 8419.358999999999
infinite surface that's impossible

8416.0 --> 8422.08
infinite surface is impossible

8419.359 --> 8423.84
understand there's no supernatural about

8422.08 --> 8427.12
that either

8423.84 --> 8427.12
now supernatural

8427.28 --> 8434.640000000001
like for example information

8430.319 --> 8438.0
and also is also defined

8434.64 --> 8440.88
you understand so yeah

8438.0 --> 8440.88
it's impossible

8443.28 --> 8449.439
there is no infinite surface but

8446.319 --> 8450.399
there may be a direction you might move

8449.439 --> 8453.12
at

8450.399 --> 8454.24
for all eternity you might pass by the

8453.12 --> 8456.479000000001
same

8454.24 --> 8458.56
spot by moving in a singular direction

8456.479 --> 8460.64
for all eternity

8458.56 --> 8462.56
that could be true that could even

8460.64 --> 8463.358999999999
physically be true if there was a loop

8462.56 --> 8466.16
within

8463.359 --> 8467.84
the spatial confine of the realm which i

8466.16 --> 8470.479
think there is because that's why

8467.84 --> 8472.64
a progenitor of the rectangular looping

8470.479 --> 8475.679999999998
flat earth concept

8472.64 --> 8478.08
but no the world is not supernatural

8475.68 --> 8480.800000000001
here we go again

8478.08 --> 8483.92
the world is natural that's why it's

8480.8 --> 8487.84
called the natural world and natural law

8483.92 --> 8487.84
what kind of asinine statement is that

8492.88 --> 8496.0
no the world is not supernatural that's

8495.2 --> 8499.52
the whole point

8496.0 --> 8502.479
it is natural kind of

8499.52 --> 8502.479000000001
listen to yourself

8510.0 --> 8517.52
yeah well your soul is not the world

8514.399 --> 8518.56
the world is the world your soul is your

8517.52 --> 8521.2
soul

8518.56 --> 8522.16
the world is the world your soul

8521.2 --> 8525.2
supernatural

8522.16 --> 8530.96
information supernatural the world

8525.2 --> 8530.960000000001
physical realm not supernatural

8538.24 --> 8543.84
this place is a dumpster fire okay

8539.84 --> 8543.84
you're out of here get the [ __ ] out

8551.04 --> 8556.240000000002
i'm putting that dumpster fire out right

8554.84 --> 8571.84
now

8556.24 --> 8571.84
you are it

8581.359 --> 8588.0
i'm sorry if physics

8584.64 --> 8590.88
is too much for you but uh yeah

8588.0 --> 8592.96
i am practically a physics teacher and

8590.88 --> 8594.88
theoretical cosmogenist

8592.96 --> 8596.399
if you're going to make stupid aside

8594.88 --> 8598.479
statements like

8596.399 --> 8601.119999999999
the world is supernatural there is

8598.479 --> 8605.679999999998
nothing natural about the world

8601.12 --> 8608.880000000001
yeah then out of here that's too dumb

8605.68 --> 8608.880000000001
i don't allow that here

8611.359 --> 8614.960000000001
especially after everything i've said

8622.96 --> 8627.519999999999
why did qe say electrical resistance

8624.96 --> 8630.0
isn't it i don't even know what that is

8627.52 --> 8632.08
i don't even know if he said that and i

8630.0 --> 8633.439
don't know the context of what he said

8632.08 --> 8636.399
so i have no idea what you're talking

8633.439 --> 8636.399
about stone monkey

8639.04 --> 8644.0
that's not true either without

8642.24 --> 8644.64
supernatural information there is no

8644.0 --> 8647.28
physical

8644.64 --> 8647.279999999999
[ __ ]

8648.0 --> 8652.08
and there's no way to prove it either

8649.84 --> 8654.56
there's plenty of stuff out there

8652.08 --> 8657.36
it's not information it's still physical

8654.56 --> 8660.479
though so it's just wrong

8657.36 --> 8660.479000000001
[Music]

8664.399 --> 8669.76
we're not in there stop the blabbering

8667.28 --> 8673.68
all of you shut the [ __ ] up

8669.76 --> 8674.960000000001
shut the [ __ ] up with your philosophical

8673.68 --> 8678.64
garbage

8674.96 --> 8680.72
yeah just because i gave you a good idea

8678.64 --> 8683.039999999999
an interesting idea about massive

8680.72 --> 8686.319
philosophy doesn't mean you can now

8683.04 --> 8689.92
just assert your mind weirdo

8686.319 --> 8693.76
[ __ ] hippy dippy [ __ ] philosophy

8689.92 --> 8696.24
on physics [ __ ] off

8693.76 --> 8697.28
the physical world is physical the

8696.24 --> 8699.76
supernatural

8697.28 --> 8700.560000000001
is supernatural these things are defined

8699.76 --> 8703.76
and you are

8700.56 --> 8705.439
not gonna just mock that [ __ ] up all of

8703.76 --> 8711.84
a sudden yeah

8705.439 --> 8711.84
get it straight right now right now

8722.91 --> 8725.959
[Music]

8726.88 --> 8739.839999999998
yeah physics teacher that's right

8742.479 --> 8746.72
yeah because i understand physics by now

8744.96 --> 8748.96
i'm a hobbyist

8746.72 --> 8750.84
i can be a physics teacher with

8748.96 --> 8753.358999999999
everything i know

8750.84 --> 8754.8
absolutely just not gonna do it on some

8753.359 --> 8757.04
[ __ ] school because they're gonna

8754.8 --> 8759.519999999999
make me do all kinds of [ __ ] things

8757.04 --> 8761.92
and indoctrinate people and i refuse to

8759.52 --> 8764.640000000001
do that no matter the cost

8761.92 --> 8766.64
i will never teach lies that i have

8764.64 --> 8768.64
figured out to people

8766.64 --> 8770.319
i might mistakenly teach them wrong

8768.64 --> 8773.68
things i will never

8770.319 --> 8776.0
teach anyone lies ever under

8773.68 --> 8778.399
any circumstance i'd [ __ ] rather kill

8776.0 --> 8781.76
myself

8778.399 --> 8782.72
right but yeah after all dude after like

8781.76 --> 8784.72
more than two

8782.72 --> 8786.88
what is it two and a half hour show this

8784.72 --> 8789.119999999999
just stop

8786.88 --> 8791.199999999999
don't assert [ __ ] all of a sudden

8789.12 --> 8795.68
just because things got philosophical

8791.2 --> 8798.560000000001
all right

8795.68 --> 8798.56
unacceptable

8803.92 --> 8807.92
yeah and i'll unban you because i

8805.92 --> 8810.72
realized that maybe you didn't mean it

8807.92 --> 8814.0
exactly as i thought you would

8810.72 --> 8815.039999999999
but yeah you might have meant it

8814.0 --> 8818.56
metaphorical

8815.04 --> 8821.6
but yeah the world is natural

8818.56 --> 8822.479
you know you can call the situation in

8821.6 --> 8824.56
the world

8822.479 --> 8826.64
a natural yeah that's fine that's very

8824.56 --> 8828.08
cute that's not what we're talking about

8826.64 --> 8830.56
we were talking about the physical

8828.08 --> 8830.56
nature

8830.88 --> 8835.119999999999
right and the physical world out there

8833.439 --> 8838.56
the nature is physical it's

8835.12 --> 8842.240000000002
not supernatural don't assert that

8838.56 --> 8846.72
ever it's a lie it's a lie

8842.24 --> 8846.72
it's as bad as what ballers do yeah

8848.96 --> 8855.279999999999
physical world is physical

8852.16 --> 8857.92
nothing will ever change that except

8855.28 --> 8861.04
the end of all that is physical that is

8857.92 --> 8861.04
what's going to change that

8861.6 --> 8865.92
all right forever consciously research

8863.92 --> 8869.52
channel yeah yeah

8865.92 --> 8869.52
i know that's why i unbanned you

8873.68 --> 8877.359
it took me a while to realize that

8877.6 --> 8884.319
sorry about that i hope you understand

8881.34 --> 8893.84
[Music]

8884.319 --> 8893.84
and yes

8895.12 --> 8899.76
heavenly realm physical what the [ __ ]

8897.2 --> 8902.16
are you talking about

8899.76 --> 8903.76
did anybody claim the heavenly realm is

8902.16 --> 8907.84
physical

8903.76 --> 8907.84
what the [ __ ]

8923.04 --> 8928.240000000002
if i can go past the three hour mark

8924.88 --> 8928.24
well i could probably

8928.88 --> 8931.759999999998
although i'll probably have to put

8930.16 --> 8935.84
another bun in the oven because i will

8931.76 --> 8935.84
get hungry again

8945.439 --> 8951.04
yeah and that's right perfection

8948.64 --> 8951.84
if you're yeah if you're above average

8951.04 --> 8953.84
intelligence

8951.84 --> 8955.92
or if you below it you're not gonna hole

8953.84 --> 8956.72
out here you're either gonna fall asleep

8955.92 --> 8958.8
get confused

8956.72 --> 8960.84
we'll move away or you're gonna blabber

8958.8 --> 8962.0
your stupid mouth up and then get banned

8960.84 --> 8963.68
instantly

8962.0 --> 8977.28
so yeah you're correct about everything

8963.68 --> 8979.53
you just said here

8977.28 --> 8982.719000000001
speaks better english than the english

8979.53 --> 8982.719000000001
[Music]

8983.92 --> 8989.52
i don't know i think that my particular

8988.16 --> 8993.039999999999
accent is somewhere

8989.52 --> 8996.399000000001
a bland in between proper british

8993.04 --> 8996.399000000001
and standard american

8996.64 --> 9000.8
and yeah i think that english have on

8999.52 --> 9004.16
average a better

9000.8 --> 9006.479
word range like more fine fine-tuned

9004.16 --> 9007.68
way to use certain types of words to

9006.479 --> 9009.92
express themselves

9007.68 --> 9011.52
much more refined than i do nathan just

9009.92 --> 9012.0
comes up with ways of saying things that

9011.52 --> 9014.399000000001
it's like

9012.0 --> 9015.359
whoa yeah that wow that you could say it

9014.399 --> 9018.8
like that yeah

9015.359 --> 9020.16
damn so british right on the other hand

9018.8 --> 9022.88
he can have this like

9020.16 --> 9025.68
really weird accent tricks traits

9022.88 --> 9032.72
sometimes and so do all of them

9025.68 --> 9034.800000000001
i don't have that at least

9032.72 --> 9036.96
but i've always very much appreciated

9034.8 --> 9036.96
the

9037.04 --> 9045.04
just the the wide variety of roots

9041.04 --> 9047.12
the british take within their language

9045.04 --> 9048.319000000001
and i know that the british language

9047.12 --> 9051.68
itself english

9048.319 --> 9053.359
was designed specifically for that

9051.68 --> 9054.479000000001
originally there's a movie about it by

9053.359 --> 9056.960000000001
the way and i thought it was awesome

9054.479 --> 9056.96
that movie

9058.96 --> 9063.199999999999
about how important the language in the

9061.12 --> 9065.12
development for the language was for the

9063.2 --> 9067.84
entire empire at the time

9065.12 --> 9069.6
that it meant everything to the ones

9067.84 --> 9072.960000000001
that were making it but also that the

9069.6 --> 9076.319
rulers took it very serious

9072.96 --> 9076.319
and yeah i respect that

9083.6 --> 9088.24
right intelligence is more about the

9086.319 --> 9091.6
ability to create

9088.24 --> 9091.6
real intelligence is

9091.68 --> 9097.359
creative dynamics

9094.8 --> 9098.88
that's real intelligence that's the core

9097.359 --> 9102.319
of what people

9098.88 --> 9106.8
feel out recognize as

9102.319 --> 9110.88
intelligence creative dynamics

9106.8 --> 9113.92
finding new ways way through

9110.88 --> 9117.599999999999
an unforeseen approach that fixes things

9113.92 --> 9120.8
that's intelligence

9117.6 --> 9120.800000000001
creative dynamics

9121.28 --> 9126.319000000001
and there's no real way to truly define

9123.76 --> 9129.12
it or to even measure out how it just

9126.319 --> 9131.199999999999
happens or it doesn't and you recognize

9129.12 --> 9134.479000000001
it when it is there

9131.2 --> 9136.800000000001
so real intelligence is very mysterious

9134.479 --> 9143.199999999999
to define it that is

9136.8 --> 9145.84
[Music]

9143.2 --> 9145.84
um

9152.319 --> 9159.039999999999
nathan could be accused of being

9156.84 --> 9162.880000000001
paraphrasing

9159.04 --> 9162.880000000001
uh how

9163.12 --> 9169.359
i isn't paraphrasing like taking things

9166.72 --> 9171.92
out of context basically

9169.359 --> 9173.92
not too sure what you mean anyway yeah

9171.92 --> 9176.399
learning spanish is hard

9173.92 --> 9177.84
and spanish is a completely different

9176.399 --> 9180.88
type of language

9177.84 --> 9183.2
with a whole different type of purpose

9180.88 --> 9185.199999999999
spanish is a much more expressive

9183.2 --> 9188.399000000001
cultural

9185.2 --> 9189.359
language that is much more attuned to

9188.399 --> 9192.24
the heart

9189.359 --> 9192.880000000001
to feelings and not so much to the to

9192.24 --> 9196.56
the brain

9192.88 --> 9196.56
to the russia that azio

9197.6 --> 9201.84
it's a rationality

9202.319 --> 9206.96
i think spanish is an incredibly

9204.16 --> 9210.319
beautiful language when spoken properly

9206.96 --> 9213.599999999999
like really well verbalized

9210.319 --> 9217.039999999999
good vocal chords spanish language

9213.6 --> 9220.16
is very beautiful even

9217.04 --> 9222.720000000001
a proper spanish accent is very very

9220.16 --> 9222.72
beautiful

9222.96 --> 9228.56
but yeah i don't

9226.319 --> 9230.319
i couldn't hear it i can recognize it i

9228.56 --> 9233.76
am not very good at it

9230.319 --> 9236.08
although i can do a decent

9233.76 --> 9238.880000000001
spanish accent english because i had a

9236.08 --> 9240.88
lot of training

9238.88 --> 9242.399
i knew respect i went to spain all the

9240.88 --> 9245.839999999998
time as a kid

9242.399 --> 9249.119999999999
on vacations like almost every year

9245.84 --> 9252.72
and it was kind of funny because

9249.12 --> 9255.04
there was a kid that i knew that was

9252.72 --> 9256.8
uh yeah he was studying for english but

9255.04 --> 9258.640000000001
he couldn't really get rid of his accent

9256.8 --> 9260.399
and he had trouble just understanding my

9258.64 --> 9263.199999999999
quality english which i

9260.399 --> 9265.68
learned english very young very very

9263.2 --> 9268.479000000001
young i was very fanatical about it

9265.68 --> 9270.24
and he was trying to learn from me but

9268.479 --> 9273.679999999998
to adapt to him

9270.24 --> 9276.24
i had to talk with a bit of a spanish

9273.68 --> 9278.0
accent so that he would comprehend it

9276.24 --> 9280.8
better

9278.0 --> 9282.08
so i learned the the different ways to

9280.8 --> 9285.679999999998
speak

9282.08 --> 9288.16
spanish english or sp english

9285.68 --> 9290.0
and then they would he would absolutely

9288.16 --> 9293.039999999999
understand me when i talked like that

9290.0 --> 9293.359
if i actually spoke proper british then

9293.04 --> 9295.12
he

9293.359 --> 9296.56
would barely comprehend a word i was

9295.12 --> 9300.01
saying

9296.56 --> 9302.72
so yeah it's funny how that works

9300.01 --> 9306.08
[Music]

9302.72 --> 9308.0
my russian spanish my russian spanish

9306.08 --> 9311.12
accent

9308.0 --> 9313.76
my i don't know how to speak russian

9311.12 --> 9314.720000000001
you just get stupid voice zones it's

9313.76 --> 9316.72
kind of dumb

9314.72 --> 9317.84
i think yeah russians find that very

9316.72 --> 9320.16
annoying when

9317.84 --> 9322.16
english people do that especially in

9320.16 --> 9324.84
hollywood

9322.16 --> 9326.24
no actual russian is just way more

9324.84 --> 9328.56
complicated

9326.24 --> 9330.8
because russian is just a whole is just

9328.56 --> 9334.08
an alien language compared to

9330.8 --> 9336.72
the others but

9334.08 --> 9338.84
like real classical well-spoken russian

9336.72 --> 9341.84
is absolutely

9338.84 --> 9341.84
magical

9346.64 --> 9354.399
ho ho ho count of

9350.399 --> 9369.84
sesame street but here is more

9354.399 --> 9369.84
italian not a russian

9370.16 --> 9373.6
you seem to have a little bit of trouble

9372.08 --> 9375.92
between

9373.6 --> 9376.960000000001
the yeah the crossover region between

9375.92 --> 9380.8
italy

9376.96 --> 9384.319
this the more western slavic

9380.8 --> 9387.119999999999
into russian because there is a big

9384.319 --> 9388.0
amount of changes that happen now on the

9387.12 --> 9391.28
surface

9388.0 --> 9393.76
they kind of sound alike they're not

9391.28 --> 9395.84
alike at all

9393.76 --> 9399.02
they really aren't

9395.84 --> 9399.02
[Music]

9422.24 --> 9427.68
like if you think that

9425.359 --> 9428.56
what is it that transylvanian sounds

9427.68 --> 9430.56
exactly like

9428.56 --> 9431.68
russian well have you ever listened to

9430.56 --> 9433.359
turkish

9431.68 --> 9435.52
because yeah if you think that

9433.359 --> 9437.68
transylvanian sounds just like russian

9435.52 --> 9438.880000000001
well then turkish is as good as russian

9437.68 --> 9442.16
as well

9438.88 --> 9444.399
it's really not it's very different but

9442.16 --> 9446.08
it still has some certain tones in it

9444.399 --> 9449.76
certain ways

9446.08 --> 9452.0
that you will recognize probably

9449.76 --> 9454.56
you know because it is it's all a it's

9452.0 --> 9457.04
like an average bland it's just like

9454.56 --> 9458.8
after a hundred or after another 100

9457.04 --> 9460.720000000001
kilometers it's slightly more

9458.8 --> 9462.479
this way in another hundred kilometers

9460.72 --> 9464.479
it's slightly more that way

9462.479 --> 9467.84
that's really how it seems to work as

9464.479 --> 9467.84
far as i figured out

9469.2 --> 9473.84
yes of course there's a lot of slavic in

9470.88 --> 9477.039999999999
russian that's its main origin

9473.84 --> 9481.52
it's pretty much that it's the caucasus

9477.04 --> 9483.359
caucasian that big mountain range

9481.52 --> 9495.52
that's where the the that all that

9483.359 --> 9509.84
accent came from pretty much

9495.52 --> 9509.84
hmm keivin

9512.24 --> 9518.319
oh god forever conscious research

9516.319 --> 9521.439
channel you better not dare me be

9518.319 --> 9524.399
asking a concave question

9521.439 --> 9527.2
don't you dare i was just proud that i

9524.399 --> 9527.199999999999
didn't ban you

9535.28 --> 9541.2
okay okay

9539.6 --> 9543.04
i don't know if you specifically looked

9541.2 --> 9545.12
it up but i'll say it for you

9543.04 --> 9546.160000000002
what you're saying here is i'm

9545.12 --> 9549.52
surprisingly

9546.16 --> 9551.84
not very good in english in dutch

9549.52 --> 9551.84
well

9552.64 --> 9558.319
in netherlands i'm not surprised because

9556.16 --> 9560.479
yeah yeah here's a funny one you thought

9558.319 --> 9563.439
that chinese was difficult right

9560.479 --> 9565.92
well officially in the linguist syntax

9563.439 --> 9568.800000000001
dutch is a more complicated language

9565.92 --> 9568.8
than chinese

9568.88 --> 9573.839999999998
now of course the dutch don't think so

9572.0 --> 9576.0
but pretty much everyone else in the

9573.84 --> 9579.52
world does when they're really

9576.0 --> 9582.24
linguists because dutch is just

9579.52 --> 9583.52
something else hey we're we're the gray

9582.24 --> 9587.119999999999
elves where

9583.52 --> 9587.84
we're we're dutch just yeah nothing else

9587.12 --> 9593.84
we touch

9587.84 --> 9593.84
just that's what it is

9615.76 --> 9621.84
you can talk all these ways it is what

9618.479 --> 9621.84
it is

9622.0 --> 9625.279
but yeah this little little country has

9624.319 --> 9629.119999999999
like

9625.279 --> 9631.439
like 20 different radically different

9629.12 --> 9635.54
accents within that tiny tiny little

9631.439 --> 9638.729000000001
country it's really funny

9635.54 --> 9638.729000000001
[Music]

9641.6 --> 9645.6
like we got specific accent for this

9644.479 --> 9648.08
city

9645.6 --> 9648.960000000001
can you get it for this city has its own

9648.08 --> 9652.24
specific

9648.96 --> 9654.56
type of accent and so does amsterdam

9652.24 --> 9656.72
and so does dan hague and so does

9654.56 --> 9658.72
rotterdam like so much so that they're

9656.72 --> 9659.679999999998
even like officially registered that

9658.72 --> 9662.88
this city

9659.68 --> 9664.880000000001
has its own accent and it's very audible

9662.88 --> 9666.56
you can hear it

9664.88 --> 9668.56
like and people in the past has like

9666.56 --> 9670.479
gotten into fights because they didn't

9668.56 --> 9673.039999999999
have the same accent and [ __ ] was

9670.479 --> 9675.199999999999
kind of silly in retrospect but that

9673.04 --> 9678.800000000001
happened

9675.2 --> 9681.84
and then we got freeze land freeze land

9678.8 --> 9684.479
and that that that province

9681.84 --> 9685.2
like its own official language what the

9684.479 --> 9688.24
[ __ ]

9685.2 --> 9692.640000000001
like a province of the netherlands

9688.24 --> 9695.52
which is that province is smaller

9692.64 --> 9696.08
than an average city in the united

9695.52 --> 9704.720000000001
states

9696.08 --> 9707.68
and it has its own official language

9704.72 --> 9707.679999999998
and then yeah

9708.16 --> 9711.6
and then there's the languages in the

9709.92 --> 9712.88
east and then there's the languages in

9711.6 --> 9716.720000000001
the south we've got

9712.88 --> 9718.88
bra brahmans

9716.72 --> 9718.88
and

9731.12 --> 9736.319000000001
and a yellow lot uh

9739.359 --> 9746.640000000001
but these days it's just a lot of

9743.84 --> 9747.04
yeah there i don't know there's there

9746.64 --> 9750.08
they

9747.04 --> 9753.12
the accent amounts is kind of dwindling

9750.08 --> 9755.439
but not really it's just that we got a

9753.12 --> 9757.84
lot of migrants pumped into us

9755.439 --> 9759.84
and yeah surprises you'd be surprised

9757.84 --> 9760.56
how many of them actually adapted but

9759.84 --> 9762.880000000001
that's because

9760.56 --> 9765.119999999999
dutch are [ __ ] awesome they're

9762.88 --> 9766.96
awesome they're awesome not that people

9765.12 --> 9768.560000000001
at first be like we're going to take

9766.96 --> 9769.679999999998
over and they think whoa these dutch are

9768.56 --> 9771.76
[ __ ] awesome

9769.68 --> 9774.479000000001
okay i'll be dutch yeah because we're

9771.76 --> 9776.319
awesome dutch are [ __ ] awesome

9774.479 --> 9779.039999999999
they used to be before they all become

9776.319 --> 9781.519999999999
liberal [ __ ] maniacs

9779.04 --> 9783.2
but most of us are naturally awesome we

9781.52 --> 9785.6
are the gray elves people

9783.2 --> 9787.359
like us so much they will become us or

9785.6 --> 9789.84
try

9787.359 --> 9789.84
so

9793.84 --> 9797.12
west germanic well did you know that

9795.68 --> 9801.2
dutch originally was

9797.12 --> 9805.12
ditz and dietz

9801.2 --> 9809.84
was an a branch off of germanic

9805.12 --> 9813.04
of german which is doubts deutsch

9809.84 --> 9815.04
dietz was like the we were the swamp

9813.04 --> 9816.160000000002
germans because the netherlands was

9815.04 --> 9819.84
basically the river

9816.16 --> 9822.399
mount of of a big river system

9819.84 --> 9825.04
that would come together at us into a

9822.399 --> 9827.599999999999
big swamp area and that was

9825.04 --> 9829.2
yeah we were the swamp dwellers at the

9827.6 --> 9830.960000000001
edge of germany

9829.2 --> 9833.359
and germany was already kind of sort of

9830.96 --> 9835.358999999999
an empire pretty early on the

9833.359 --> 9836.720000000001
did yeah we were just a bunch of swamp

9835.359 --> 9840.800000000001
dwellers

9836.72 --> 9844.16
mock farmers and [ __ ] yeah

9840.8 --> 9846.88
and with that also probably

9844.16 --> 9850.16
mud flutters we were like the number one

9846.88 --> 9854.0
mudflatter industrialists pretty much

9850.16 --> 9854.399
always have been we became great on that

9854.0 --> 9858.24
and

9854.399 --> 9862.319
banking right but yeah

9858.24 --> 9865.52
so but we started out as dietz

9862.319 --> 9867.359
and only during the supposed renaissance

9865.52 --> 9869.2
we really started to develop our own

9867.359 --> 9871.52
official language kind of parallel to

9869.2 --> 9873.52
the english

9871.52 --> 9875.52
and also landing some of the english

9873.52 --> 9876.319000000001
because dutch yeah you'd be surprised

9875.52 --> 9878.640000000001
but dutch

9876.319 --> 9879.6
if you really look into the origins of

9878.64 --> 9883.119999999999
it

9879.6 --> 9886.720000000001
it's very much a blend between

9883.12 --> 9890.640000000001
german french and english

9886.72 --> 9890.64
or german and french

9890.88 --> 9896.64
became dutch and then english kind of

9894.08 --> 9900.24
lent from dutch it's complicated because

9896.64 --> 9903.278999999999
english learnt from german and french

9900.24 --> 9906.56
but also from dutch

9903.279 --> 9908.800000000001
but the dutch also kind of shaped ours

9906.56 --> 9911.119999999999
we shaped ourselves in a similar way we

9908.8 --> 9913.438999999998
just had a lot of vowel rotating we

9911.12 --> 9915.84
wanted to do it the dutch we

9913.439 --> 9917.84
do it dutch we just oh we do it exactly

9915.84 --> 9920.960000000001
the same but exactly opposite we

9917.84 --> 9923.76
we're the dutch yeah

9920.96 --> 9924.64
so it's a very curious history to all

9923.76 --> 9926.84
that

9924.64 --> 9928.08
i was found that was very fascinating

9926.84 --> 9943.84
myself

9928.08 --> 9943.84
man it's getting dark

9952.72 --> 9956.24
no no dutch does not have too many rules

9955.52 --> 9959.76
dutch has

9956.24 --> 9962.8
exactly enough rules

9959.76 --> 9966.399
in the language that is politics

9962.8 --> 9966.399
don't be getting about that but

9966.64 --> 9970.24
now i think the dutch language is

9968.0 --> 9972.0
absolutely perfect i've never

9970.24 --> 9974.08
come across anything that i thought yeah

9972.0 --> 9976.24
this is just wrong

9974.08 --> 9977.37
nope dutch language is the best language

9976.24 --> 9980.399
in the [ __ ] world

9977.37 --> 9983.439
[Music]

9980.399 --> 9987.119999999999
too bad nobody can speak it but us

9983.439 --> 9991.12
and too bad for everybody else that is

9987.12 --> 9991.12
because we can damn well speak english

9991.68 --> 9994.829
[Music]

9996.24 --> 10000.0
or gaelic people in amsterdam is it i

9998.88 --> 10002.96
didn't know that

10000.0 --> 10003.439
i didn't know amsterdam was popular with

10002.96 --> 10005.919999999998
the

10003.439 --> 10005.92
irish

10007.279 --> 10012.08
then again yeah it is it is cannabis and

10009.68 --> 10014.56
prostitute country

10012.08 --> 10017.76
so maybe that i don't know is probably

10014.56 --> 10017.76
popular with a lot of people

10020.8 --> 10024.319
latin is the most beautiful well again i

10023.359 --> 10028.0
addressed it before

10024.319 --> 10031.199999999999
latin the spanish

10028.0 --> 10034.08
latin specific was designed

10031.2 --> 10034.960000000001
to be a language of the heart and the

10034.08 --> 10036.72
feelings

10034.96 --> 10038.96
so yeah that typically makes it

10036.72 --> 10043.519999999999
beautiful

10038.96 --> 10046.319
gaelic origins uh no

10043.52 --> 10047.92
no don't know where you're getting that

10046.319 --> 10050.24
no

10047.92 --> 10050.960000000001
amsterdam does not have gaelic origins

10050.24 --> 10054.68
that's a

10050.96 --> 10059.119999999999
very nice fantasy amsterdam was

10054.68 --> 10059.12
absolutely founded by the dutch

10059.359 --> 10062.56
i don't know where you're getting this

10066.479 --> 10072.96
i've become the daughter what duchess of

10069.84 --> 10076.0
uh well

10072.96 --> 10079.039999999999
look south africa was

10076.0 --> 10081.04
originally colonized by the dutch and so

10079.04 --> 10084.479000000001
that's how they got to

10081.04 --> 10085.68
afrikaans which is basically a very

10084.479 --> 10088.8
extreme accent

10085.68 --> 10097.84
version of dutch they got it from us not

10088.8 --> 10097.84
the other way around

10103.439 --> 10111.84
you can order a beer and dutch

10122.84 --> 10125.84
wow

10141.439 --> 10148.24
okay terret 306 i haven't really

10145.279 --> 10150.720000000001
tried to learn any language you might be

10148.24 --> 10153.84
surprised

10150.72 --> 10155.438999999998
i learned english i tried to learn a bit

10153.84 --> 10158.319
of spanish

10155.439 --> 10159.359
didn't stick too much i used to know a

10158.319 --> 10161.439
couple of

10159.359 --> 10162.960000000001
things in spanish i don't i lost it i

10161.439 --> 10165.439
completely lost it

10162.96 --> 10167.599999999999
just english overtook it all so you

10165.439 --> 10170.56
might be surprised at

10167.6 --> 10171.68
actual mastery of the language i'm not

10170.56 --> 10174.96
that great

10171.68 --> 10176.479000000001
except for english and dutch but english

10174.96 --> 10179.679999999998
probably even more

10176.479 --> 10180.08
although yeah dutch yeah i'm probably

10179.68 --> 10183.2
pretty

10180.08 --> 10186.56
damn good at dutch too i could very

10183.2 --> 10186.560000000001
easily be a dutch teacher

10187.359 --> 10194.800000000001
but yeah knowing other languages no i

10192.24 --> 10196.88
i had a technical package in school

10194.8 --> 10198.8
because i was not good at languages i

10196.88 --> 10200.479
was terrible at it i hated it it gave me

10198.8 --> 10202.0
a headache every [ __ ] time and i

10200.479 --> 10204.399
hated it

10202.0 --> 10205.12
like this stupid basic sentence it's

10204.399 --> 10208.319
also

10205.12 --> 10210.160000000002
dumb it didn't catch on

10208.319 --> 10212.24
and it was just like i don't want to

10210.16 --> 10214.479
know these stupid languages

10212.24 --> 10215.68
they're dumb the people there are

10214.479 --> 10219.519999999999
[ __ ] dumb

10215.68 --> 10222.56
if this is the what the books say

10219.52 --> 10223.12
that is like useful for you to learn and

10222.56 --> 10225.68
i just

10223.12 --> 10226.960000000001
never want to go there [ __ ] those people

10225.68 --> 10231.52
[ __ ] germany

10226.96 --> 10231.519999999999
[ __ ] friends just [ __ ] them

10231.6 --> 10238.319
and yeah looking now in the worlds i

10236.08 --> 10241.439
wasn't that far off

10238.319 --> 10241.439
if you know what i mean

10241.52 --> 10246.399000000001
english now english was always fun for

10243.68 --> 10246.399
me always

10246.479 --> 10250.0
and i had a great english teacher that

10248.0 --> 10252.399
would show us

10250.0 --> 10255.68
blackadder so yeah can have better

10252.399 --> 10255.68
english class than that

10257.76 --> 10261.52
but i've never really learned other

10259.279 --> 10264.960000000001
languages but i have

10261.52 --> 10267.2
learned to recognize the sound

10264.96 --> 10269.599999999999
and the feeling of language and

10267.2 --> 10271.52
recognize the spirit of the people that

10269.6 --> 10273.279
wield the language so i learned almost

10271.52 --> 10275.359
everything but the language itself

10273.279 --> 10277.52
everywhere

10275.359 --> 10279.279
so i recognize i can recognize okay this

10277.52 --> 10281.359
person sounds kind of turkish or hey

10279.279 --> 10283.68
this person sounds moroccan or hey this

10281.359 --> 10287.2
person sounds greek

10283.68 --> 10288.56
or hey this person is like kazakhstan or

10287.2 --> 10290.960000000001
something

10288.56 --> 10293.199999999999
i'm not sure then but you know that in

10290.96 --> 10295.039999999999
that direction i can recognize like

10293.2 --> 10297.12
like no this is slightly different this

10295.04 --> 10299.359
is not that that's not bad

10297.12 --> 10307.84
i know how to feel it although i don't

10299.359 --> 10307.84
know what they're saying even

10322.7 --> 10325.799
[Music]

10327.04 --> 10335.84
never heard of that duolingo

10330.72 --> 10335.84
that sounds interesting

10343.2 --> 10350.560000000001
where are you talking to

10346.84 --> 10363.84
perfection he hasn't spoken a long time

10350.56 --> 10363.84
here here we go again what

10382.8 --> 10390.0
right besides you know

10385.92 --> 10392.16
reading languages just reading it

10390.0 --> 10394.08
and then seeing oh this is what it says

10392.16 --> 10395.84
in that language that you do get

10394.08 --> 10397.52
that doesn't really teach you as much

10395.84 --> 10399.52
you know because

10397.52 --> 10401.439
if you don't know what it actually

10399.52 --> 10404.640000000001
sounds like

10401.439 --> 10406.56
then you don't really know what it is if

10404.64 --> 10409.199999999999
somebody's gonna say that sentence that

10406.56 --> 10412.24
you read you won't even recognize it

10409.2 --> 10413.76
you see because it's for me it's very if

10412.24 --> 10415.6
you're actually gonna learn the language

10413.76 --> 10418.399
then you have to understand

10415.6 --> 10419.04
the sonics of it you have to understand

10418.399 --> 10422.0
the

10419.04 --> 10423.92
intonations and exactly what what means

10422.0 --> 10425.439
so that you recognize it

10423.92 --> 10427.84
when it is said otherwise you're not

10425.439 --> 10431.04
learning anything you're just learning

10427.84 --> 10432.319
code that's not the language it's just

10431.04 --> 10436.0
reading

10432.319 --> 10438.96
see so actual

10436.0 --> 10439.84
language teaching requires a physical

10438.96 --> 10447.839999999998
person that can

10439.84 --> 10447.84
speak it in my opinion

10450.399 --> 10456.96
right holy [ __ ]

10453.52 --> 10461.84
three hour show guys three hours

10456.96 --> 10465.119999999999
how about that

10461.84 --> 10467.52
sunscreen this sony code

10465.12 --> 10467.52
could be

10468.96 --> 10474.319
four more hours yeah good luck with that
