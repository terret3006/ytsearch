7.85 --> 45.239000000000004
[Music]

41.67 --> 49.079
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

45.239 --> 51.959999999999994
early-bird number 211 I'm your host

49.079 --> 53.879
Arwen and before we start the show

51.96 --> 56.46
please don't forget to share it on any

53.879 --> 57.9
platform you deem fit and also if you

56.46 --> 60.51
haven't already subscribed to my channel

57.9 --> 62.55
and hit about notification so you know

60.51 --> 66.21
when I'm going live which is normally 2

62.55 --> 68.78
p.m. Amsterdam time please also support

66.21 --> 73.5
my show through the Super chats paypal

68.78 --> 80.16
patreon link and my GoFundMe so yeah the

73.5 --> 84.03
weather today is nice little cloudy here

80.16 --> 86.75
there bit windy but not constantly warm

84.03 --> 97.89
although the wind can be kind of fresh

86.75 --> 100.44
yeah that's just a nice day so let's see

97.89 --> 103.59
yeah I'm gonna have Riley onto the show

100.44 --> 107.759
but before we do that let's see who's in

103.59 --> 110.4
chat so CH am James Mason Jason

107.759 --> 120.5
McCormack in the middle road matrix

110.4 --> 125.22
media good to see you guys so let's see

120.5 --> 131.97
before I get Riley on so anything

125.22 --> 135.93
specific oh yeah I just passed the 1000

131.97 --> 137.97
and 300 subscriber mark although yeah

135.93 --> 140.79000000000002
even though yeah now I just mentioned it

137.97 --> 143.4
so I'll bet that before the show ends

140.79 --> 145.5
it'll be below it but because it's

143.4 --> 147.72
always like going up and down up and

145.5 --> 150.36
down like there's weird fluctuations

147.72 --> 150.75
going on there but oh well it is what it

150.36 --> 155.07000000000002
is

150.75 --> 159.52
e hello a Mackenzie peanuts Clark and

155.07 --> 162.5
over moco so

159.52 --> 166.0
yeah that was Owen Benjamin with Fox Day

162.5 --> 166.0
yesterday that was really interesting

168.31 --> 174.8
also the debates were just really good

171.41 --> 179.03
there was a very long after show yeah I

174.8 --> 181.43
even joined josé's although yeah it it

179.03 --> 186.02
was kind of funny there was a battle

181.43 --> 187.97
going on within the globus like to globe

186.02 --> 191.59
cosmogenic concepts the electric

187.97 --> 195.59
universe against the classical classical

191.59 --> 199.54
vacuum of space universe and it was very

195.59 --> 203.56
messy and it was getting all nerd rage

199.54 --> 205.54999999999998
like I couldn't really get in between

203.56 --> 209.03
like there was nothing I could really

205.55 --> 212.84
say they were just so nitpicking way out

209.03 --> 215.87
there it was a nerd rage but I did

212.84 --> 218.27
mention the earth is flat between there

215.87 --> 222.35
couple of times and I think I had a good

218.27 --> 225.83
discussion also yeah I started to just

222.35 --> 227.63
function like a moderator because I did

225.83 --> 230.18
think it was kind of interesting but

227.63 --> 232.49
these guys were just not very much in

230.18 --> 235.55
control of themselves so that they

232.49 --> 239.09
really just moderate I guess how they

235.55 --> 244.34
was just standing by I was moderating I

239.09 --> 253.06
don't know couldn't help but hello

244.34 --> 253.06
Daffy Duck ran and Cooke misty incognita

254.819 --> 261.78
a McKinsey oh yeah by the way I got to

259.41 --> 280.05
wear a coffee with me today and Aunty

261.78 --> 283.32
and that's it hmm yes I was very active

280.05 --> 287.28000000000003
yesterday and I went on to stay up

283.32 --> 297.12
pretty late like three o'clock just kept

287.28 --> 300.80999999999995
on doing stuff so yeah let's get Riley

297.12 --> 303.979
on he was very eager to present

300.81 --> 306.96
something so we're getting an exclusive

303.979 --> 308.94
and was had to do with relative relative

306.96 --> 324.75
density disequilibrium so I'm kind of

308.94 --> 329.389
curious well it's gonna be hello good

324.75 --> 334.59
morning you good yeah done great you

329.389 --> 338.729
know let's just get this noise and we

334.59 --> 340.44
live yes we are all right have you

338.729 --> 344.07
you've not watched my last couple of

340.44 --> 346.889
videos of you know sorry oh oh well

344.07 --> 351.0
maybe maybe I have actually but I'd look

346.889 --> 353.789
I watch a lot of snippet videos and like

351.0 --> 357.539
a world snippets of ranty and Nathan and

353.789 --> 360.479
you but I mean well I may have missed

357.539 --> 362.58
the last one well you know that you and

360.479 --> 364.53
I started off on like a bad footing in

362.58 --> 366.24
that we disagreed vehemently against

364.53 --> 368.159
whatever this gravity downward

366.24 --> 370.8
acceleration force thing is and we were

368.159 --> 372.389
arguing over probably the meaning of

370.8 --> 373.91900000000004
words more than the physics because the

372.389 --> 376.77
physics were on the same page with now

373.919 --> 378.63
bore transcribe or distinguish what we

376.77 --> 380.159
were arguing again is so difficult when

378.63 --> 382.83
the science doesn't even exist for what

380.159 --> 384.84
we're arguing about right oh yeah I'm

382.83 --> 387.82
pretty sure I'll never be allowed to

384.84 --> 390.31
forget that yes thanks to you

387.82 --> 392.17
but well now that work now that me and

390.31 --> 393.64
you were on the same page in the sense

392.17 --> 395.14000000000004
that we realized that whatever it is

393.64 --> 396.96999999999997
going on it's not the same as what we're

395.14 --> 398.62
being told we're able to have a

396.97 --> 400.87
conversation now without it being really

398.62 --> 402.58
aggressive but a lot of people that are

400.87 --> 404.35
in our community right now are at the

402.58 --> 406.81
point that you and I were at maybe eight

404.35 --> 408.99
months ago and when you realize that

406.81 --> 411.33
there's such a resistance against

408.99 --> 413.41
accepting this relative density is

411.33 --> 419.44
causing things when there's a state of

413.41 --> 421.09000000000003
disequilibrium that it's it's not the in

419.44 --> 424.96
acceptance of the relative density

421.09 --> 427.81
Theory it is the it's like a hurt

424.96 --> 429.96999999999997
because of the aberration of gravity

427.81 --> 434.89
it's like you can fall in love with the

429.97 --> 438.1
smoothness of the framework yeah and I I

434.89 --> 440.59
do it like I still it is still like a

438.1 --> 442.66
broken up relationship to me but I still

440.59 --> 444.96999999999997
like to look back at it like yeah it is

442.66 --> 447.94
kind of impressive and awesome and I

444.97 --> 451.15000000000003
shudder to think if I couldn't have let

447.94 --> 453.7
that go but I agree it is an aberration

451.15 --> 457.51
and that's why that's why I really gave

453.7 --> 460.36
it that name because it is like a ghost

457.51 --> 463.45
that can haunt people because of its

460.36 --> 466.45
fluid fluidity it is so useful it is

463.45 --> 468.59999999999997
such a great tool but yeah when you

466.45 --> 471.4
really get to the physical part that's

468.6 --> 474.25
that's just where it ends because it's a

471.4 --> 477.19
ghost it's an aberration or what I've

474.25 --> 479.11
done is I've I've collaborated with

477.19 --> 481.93
somebody that I can't reveal who because

479.11 --> 483.43
he doesn't even isn't is it he's in a

481.93 --> 485.8
position that he needs to protect that's

483.43 --> 487.51
all I can all I can say and but he

485.8 --> 489.13
totally he's all he's on my page he

487.51 --> 490.45
understands or he's on our page he

489.13 --> 492.04
understands what we're trying to say

490.45 --> 493.84
even though we don't really have the

492.04 --> 495.52000000000004
words to describe what we're saying when

493.84 --> 497.65
we know what we're saying and he gets it

495.52 --> 499.47999999999996
and what he offered was he said I'll

497.65 --> 501.72999999999996
help you he said you tell me what you

499.48 --> 502.93
want and I'll do it and I said I don't

501.73 --> 504.19
know what I want I don't know how this

502.93 --> 505.21
works I said I just know what's

504.19 --> 507.88
happening and I don't know how to

505.21 --> 509.38
demonstrate it better he said well if I

507.88 --> 511.27
give you some suggestions you tell me

509.38 --> 513.88
what you think and then I'll go and do

511.27 --> 516.25
and I said well Sally what what are you

513.88 --> 517.599
gonna do the video first and then talk

516.25 --> 519.099
me through it I said because if you talk

517.599 --> 520.96
me through it before you do it without

519.099 --> 521.37
me being able to see it it might not

520.96 --> 523.14
work

521.37 --> 524.97
way that you intended it to work when

523.14 --> 526.17
you were describing it so maybe just do

524.97 --> 528.24
it and then shoot me the video and then

526.17 --> 529.529
talk me through it so we didn't render

528.24 --> 531.72
what you went away and he did so much

529.529 --> 534.36
luck to me maybe a little bit more

531.72 --> 536.9100000000001
specific because this is very meta like

534.36 --> 541.0500000000001
what exactly well what's the setup that

536.91 --> 543.48
was okay so the guy the guy in question

541.05 --> 546.0889999999999
has got access to chemistry like lab

543.48 --> 548.4
materials like stands and clamps and

546.089 --> 550.44
stuff leather conical flasks the things

548.4 --> 552.3299999999999
that we had in like school but he's got

550.44 --> 555.0600000000001
him up in a lab and but he basically

552.33 --> 557.5200000000001
said to me said I can demonstrate to you

555.06 --> 560.3389999999999
that what you're telling people is true

557.52 --> 561.72
and I said okay so he went and put some

560.339 --> 563.82
words together for me and then he showed

561.72 --> 565.98
it me and when he first showed it to me

563.82 --> 567.8100000000001
and he started to explain why what was

565.98 --> 569.49
happening was happening I didn't even

567.81 --> 571.56
get it I didn't get what it was point

569.49 --> 573.029
was but you have to talk me through it

571.56 --> 575.43
spoon feed me through it and I even

573.029 --> 578.87
understand what's going on but when he

575.43 --> 581.279
told me what he told me and I realized I

578.87 --> 585.0
mean just cover the cover this for me

581.279 --> 588.75
nice one satphone give me one sec sure

585.0 --> 595.29
I really like where you're going with

588.75 --> 600.9
this it makes me want to get involved so

595.29 --> 603.38
if you want to show a video just link me

600.9 --> 603.38
up with it

607.13 --> 622.07
Lu no I think he's doing something right

618.96 --> 622.07
[Music]

640.029 --> 651.3389999999999
yeah are you guys enjoying yourself some

642.279 --> 661.029
Chet hope so it's gonna weird Riley just

651.339 --> 664.11
went silent for a moment a Dark Star a

661.029 --> 664.11
long time no see

675.19 --> 680.99
not I don't know I think Riley probably

679.25 --> 687.59
got like a business phone call or

680.99 --> 690.16
something yeah it is kind of rude but

687.59 --> 693.49
yeah what can you do

690.16 --> 699.5899999999999
yeah we'll see

693.49 --> 704.27
so in the meantime yeah right it's a

699.59 --> 707.1800000000001
density so somebody's gonna prove it in

704.27 --> 711.25
a laboratory experiment relative density

707.18 --> 714.77
well that shouldn't be too hard really

711.25 --> 717.92
what I am kind of curious that about is

714.77 --> 720.8299999999999
if this colleague this guide is friends

717.92 --> 724.75
also has a vacuum chamber now then

720.83 --> 724.75
things can get really interesting

728.99 --> 739.46
you know we flat-earthers really should

734.54 --> 742.61
have like a I'm I'm jet and I'm kind of

739.46 --> 744.5
like dreaming aloud but almost like we

742.61 --> 747.92
should have our own laboratory like

744.5 --> 751.49
things you could have membership off and

747.92 --> 754.76
just a laboratory to do stuff typically

751.49 --> 761.72
for this science laboratories that are

754.76 --> 763.76
like under our I don't know maybe it's

761.72 --> 766.34
not even necessary it all depends on the

763.76 --> 769.49
openness of whatever laboratory if

766.34 --> 771.5600000000001
they're interested and they and they're

769.49 --> 773.99
not highly allergic to flatter then it

771.56 --> 776.5999999999999
it would work fine as well I guess just

773.99 --> 780.14
like this friend I don't know if he is a

776.6 --> 782.1800000000001
flatterer or not I'm just gonna keep

780.14 --> 784.9
speculating until Riley actually get

782.18 --> 784.9
back get back

791.47 --> 798.1600000000001
now was it is a comprehensive

794.83 --> 801.1800000000001
description you just don't comprehend it

798.16 --> 801.18
that's not the same thing

811.24 --> 816.85
yeah and again I'd like to just

814.509 --> 819.869
emphasize that the relative density why

816.85 --> 823.149
the relative part is to make it

819.869 --> 829.899
accessible to physical experimentation

823.149 --> 833.259
it's like the key to that okay but yeah

829.899 --> 835.629
in reality everything surrounding that

833.259 --> 838.059
because yeah relative density is not the

835.629 --> 840.1
only thing happening obviously but

838.059 --> 844.24
that's just a way to prove it with

840.1 --> 845.74
science that's the way to enable that if

844.24 --> 850.3
you then look at everything surrounding

845.74 --> 854.23
it there is of course still the the axis

850.3 --> 857.29
of the spectrum the directions in which

854.23 --> 860.29
relative density spectrum is divided and

857.29 --> 865.74
all that and all the aberrations and all

860.29 --> 869.259
that makes it gravity so suggestible so

865.74 --> 871.439
the relative density does it's not like

869.259 --> 874.809
it makes everything relative it only

871.439 --> 875.4699999999999
concerns the relative density theory to

874.809 --> 879.54
prove it

875.47 --> 883.0590000000001
you've got to realize that that is

879.54 --> 885.9989999999999
really important to take into mind that

883.059 --> 888.549
it's better definitely is more it's just

885.999 --> 893.2900000000001
doesn't concern the relative density

888.549 --> 897.1
Theory I'm back sorry it's not on

893.29 --> 899.23
cellphone am i interrupting well it is

897.1 --> 901.6890000000001
kind of rude to just walk out like that

899.23 --> 905.49
but I filled it up I talked a bit about

901.689 --> 908.199
relative density and why it is relative

905.49 --> 910.509
concerning the scientific method and how

908.199 --> 913.4799999999999
yeah that it creates access to

910.509 --> 917.47
scientific prove ability but that it

913.48 --> 918.549
also kind of excludes just it doesn't

917.47 --> 920.259
need it

918.549 --> 923.199
everything that's surrounding it like

920.259 --> 925.569
the axes and all kinds of other

923.199 --> 931.54
influences only concerns the relative

925.569 --> 932.949
density theory so what I'm gonna do what

931.54 --> 934.449
I want people to do is just go to my

932.949 --> 936.429
channel and check out my most recent

934.449 --> 937.959
video one of the hang one of the

936.429 --> 940.8389999999999
comments on the video that I've just

937.959 --> 943.209
done is basically crediting me and

940.839 --> 944.98
criticising conspiracy cats or Baldy

943.209 --> 947.17
cats now basically because I'm gonna try

944.98 --> 949.0
do I'm trying to prove my point right

947.17 --> 950.199
I'm actually doing science I'm trying to

949.0 --> 951.699
do science I might not be getting it

950.199 --> 953.649
right but I'm making an attempt to do

951.699 --> 955.209
some work right and I'm not just

953.649 --> 957.61
providing rhetoric which is what

955.209 --> 959.8199999999999
conspiracy counts does so in the context

957.61 --> 962.0790000000001
of like what I've actually achieved

959.82 --> 964.149
people are noticing it and it's nice to

962.079 --> 965.8889999999999
see that I'm getting credited for trying

964.149 --> 966.97
to do stuff even if it's wrong at least

965.889 --> 968.7090000000001
I'm trying and it's making the

966.97 --> 973.5600000000001
conversation move forward and that's

968.709 --> 979.18
only a good thing yeah I agree

973.56 --> 980.709
do what are you doing oh I'm just

979.18 --> 984.79
cleaning my microphone is it dead loud

980.709 --> 986.079
yeah sorry I've got a chrome bezel on my

984.79 --> 987.579
microphone and it's got all their dust

986.079 --> 990.6389999999999
on it so I wanted it to be clean so I

987.579 --> 995.279
just cleaned off and well next time mute

990.639 --> 997.9300000000001
it as you start to clean anyway yeah so

995.279 --> 1000.6
anything more in-depth you wanted to

997.93 --> 1003.3889999999999
discuss about it like what was the setup

1000.6 --> 1005.399
can you get it were there chemical

1003.389 --> 1009.87
reactions involved or was it really just

1005.399 --> 1014.37
all the density things and oh no we

1009.87 --> 1016.44
burnt magnesium sorry we burnt magnesium

1014.37 --> 1018.569
- what we did was report magnesium

1016.44 --> 1020.97
bromide in a conical flask and set fire

1018.569 --> 1023.069
to it and what it did was it created an

1020.97 --> 1025.14
exothermic reaction which was heat given

1023.069 --> 1026.8799999999999
off which you would expect the syringe

1025.14 --> 1029.1000000000001
it would you would expect it to increase

1026.88 --> 1030.929
the pressure inside the inside the

1029.1 --> 1032.85
conical flask because it's burning and

1030.929 --> 1035.2800000000002
it's created energy whilst it's burning

1032.85 --> 1037.4099999999999
but it's also burning the oxygen content

1035.28 --> 1039.6
of the earth that's inside the conical

1037.41 --> 1040.919
flask but what it actually did was it

1039.6 --> 1042.6
pulled the plunger because we had a

1040.919 --> 1044.22
syringe attached to this the conical

1042.6 --> 1045.78
flask so that the syringe was

1044.22 --> 1048.15
demonstrating what was at what the ER

1045.78 --> 1049.71
was doing was it being was it expanding

1048.15 --> 1052.65
or was it was introducing the mass

1049.71 --> 1054.179
inside the conical flask and it actually

1052.65 --> 1055.74
went the opposite way to what I expected

1054.179 --> 1058.5900000000001
given that we're adding energy to the

1055.74 --> 1060.809
situation by setting fire to someone but

1058.59 --> 1062.6999999999998
it's really it's a chemical reaction so

1060.809 --> 1064.5
you should expect that every time a

1062.7 --> 1067.02
chemical reaction is involved there

1064.5 --> 1070.71
usually is some kind of interaction with

1067.02 --> 1072.24
air with so yeah but the opposite way I

1070.71 --> 1074.3400000000001
thought it would increase the mass that

1072.24 --> 1075.84
was inside the thing it went in the

1074.34 --> 1078.01
opposite way it reduced the mass that

1075.84 --> 1081.58
was inside but it doesn't create

1078.01 --> 1085.09
a gas mostly it creates smoke particles

1081.58 --> 1087.85
and that solids much denser in relation

1085.09 --> 1090.3999999999999
to the gas so that makes sense there's

1087.85 --> 1093.4599999999998
gasoline taking away smaller particles

1090.4 --> 1094.75
being ejected you see say that but you

1093.46 --> 1096.01
should watch it and see if it does what

1094.75 --> 1097.87
you expected it to do it did the

1096.01 --> 1099.76
opposite of why I expected it did what I

1097.87 --> 1101.02
expected in the sense that it moved but

1099.76 --> 1104.44
it didn't go the way I thought it went

1101.02 --> 1108.16
survived the cork in oh yeah it's okay

1104.44 --> 1109.8700000000001
now sense sure but it wasn't what I

1108.16 --> 1111.28
expected that I expected it to increase

1109.87 --> 1112.6299999999999
the mass but in any event it doesn't

1111.28 --> 1117.61
matter it's still worth watch it's still

1112.63 --> 1119.8300000000002
worth watching fire fire yeah so fire -

1117.61 --> 1124.1689999999999
so school yeah a magnesium is like

1119.83 --> 1124.1689999999999
incredibly bright it's fascinating

1124.38 --> 1130.21
right yeah somebody just bought you

1128.44 --> 1131.799
demonstrated the principle of earthy

1130.21 --> 1132.13
hoon equilibrium the same principal

1131.799 --> 1134.23
causes

1132.13 --> 1139.8400000000001
airplanes to generate enough lift no

1134.23 --> 1141.16
it's not well I should I should be on

1139.84 --> 1147.4599999999998
mute shouldn't hang on give me a second

1141.16 --> 1152.65
all right so fire yeah if you gonna burn

1147.46 --> 1157.38
something burning almost always involves

1152.65 --> 1160.21
interaction with gases unless the the

1157.38 --> 1165.8500000000001
chemical substance that is reacting has

1160.21 --> 1168.6100000000001
its own oxygenator then it can react

1165.85 --> 1172.24
yeah even without exposure to the air

1168.61 --> 1174.79
that's how for example high explosives

1172.24 --> 1178.0
work they detonate because of that

1174.79 --> 1181.0
because oxygen is inside of it again

1178.0 --> 1184.48
explosives as well like gunpowder has

1181.0 --> 1191.5
its own oxygenator within it and nitrate

1184.48 --> 1194.98
I think third poo and yeah that is an

1191.5 --> 1197.559
oxygenator so in that case it doesn't

1194.98 --> 1200.26
necessarily interact with the air and

1197.559 --> 1203.49
it's gonna burn it up but usually with

1200.26 --> 1206.74
every type of chemical reaction burning

1203.49 --> 1211.78
it's always very apparent with burning

1206.74 --> 1214.57
where fire is is smoke and smoke is all

1211.78 --> 1218.82
yeah it's not gas it's not transparent

1214.57 --> 1222.9099999999999
its particulates that are solids but

1218.82 --> 1226.4099999999999
microscope yeah very small and poor yeah

1222.91 --> 1229.51
solid particles are always more dense

1226.41 --> 1231.64
than gases so if there is going to be

1229.51 --> 1234.43
interaction with gases it's logical that

1231.64 --> 1237.67
those gases get absorbed those gases

1234.43 --> 1241.1200000000001
have quite a lot of volume compared to

1237.67 --> 1246.43
the dust the smoke particles that then

1241.12 --> 1248.53
manifest out of that that are yeah much

1246.43 --> 1251.23
slow much smaller in volume so it

1248.53 --> 1253.51
definitely logical to me that in a

1251.23 --> 1256.1200000000001
chemical reaction yeah if you cork it

1253.51 --> 1256.89
the cork would be sucked in totally

1256.12 --> 1259.36
logical

1256.89 --> 1260.71
yeah it's logical it just wasn't what I

1259.36 --> 1262.81
thought would happen based on what we

1260.71 --> 1264.97
were doing I thought that the heat that

1262.81 --> 1266.5
was generated by the magnesium would

1264.97 --> 1268.45
expand the earth that much it would

1266.5 --> 1270.31
increase the pressure because I know

1268.45 --> 1272.77
that I remember that magnesium burning

1270.31 --> 1274.57
was really bright and hot so I thought

1272.77 --> 1276.85
that would increase the pressure but it

1274.57 --> 1278.3799999999999
doesn't matter it's just one of those

1276.85 --> 1280.4499999999998
interesting reactions that did the

1278.38 --> 1282.5800000000002
opposite of our thought with pure

1280.45 --> 1284.6200000000001
magnesium that's logical but if you

1282.58 --> 1292.6
would oxygenate it if you would mix it

1284.62 --> 1294.6699999999998
up with a night ray or a peroxide anyway

1292.6 --> 1296.32
an oxygenator I don't know the the

1294.67 --> 1300.43
chemical term instead the fireworks

1296.32 --> 1303.31
stuff there's like really regular ones

1300.43 --> 1305.29
and very high ones that make things very

1303.31 --> 1308.1699999999998
reactive but if you combine that then

1305.29 --> 1310.36
it's then it's gonna probably flash

1308.17 --> 1313.0500000000002
really quickly and then the tube will

1310.36 --> 1315.25
explode or the cork will burst out

1313.05 --> 1319.03
because it's not burning up the air

1315.25 --> 1324.3
instead it's very quickly burning up the

1319.03 --> 1324.3
oxygenator so yeah

1324.86 --> 1334.56
chemistry love it yeah yeah I used to my

1332.4 --> 1338.64
brother used to be a lot into chemistry

1334.56 --> 1340.83
even like during New Year's Eve or

1338.64 --> 1343.23
before that he would start to like

1340.83 --> 1346.74
really build his own fireworks and [ __ ]

1343.23 --> 1349.95
sometimes really impressive love that a

1346.74 --> 1351.6
lot I was always like the assistant

1349.95 --> 1355.19
looking over the shoulder and like oh my

1351.6 --> 1355.1899999999998
god he has to be really really careful

1355.97 --> 1366.44
love it yeah well I'm just looking

1363.81 --> 1368.76
through the omens

1366.44 --> 1370.14
what's your position with Matt doxy

1368.76 --> 1379.77
these days are you guys friends or

1370.14 --> 1381.8700000000001
acquaintances or I I don't know when he

1379.77 --> 1386.04
we have a non-aggression pact let's just

1381.87 --> 1389.07
call it like that non-aggression part I

1386.04 --> 1392.58
know it's aggression understanding not a

1389.07 --> 1394.47
product really it's just that yeah when

1392.58 --> 1397.26
we don't really get in one another's way

1394.47 --> 1400.47
we definitely do not agree on certain

1397.26 --> 1403.95
things and there's no prospect of yeah

1400.47 --> 1406.59
one of each other moving closer towards

1403.95 --> 1411.3300000000002
one another so we're just like okay you

1406.59 --> 1412.86
just do your thing I'll do my thing it's

1411.33 --> 1416.61
an interesting guy he's turned into a

1412.86 --> 1419.25
hater of mine yeah that's one of the bad

1416.61 --> 1422.1299999999999
things like Mark doxy for some reason

1419.25 --> 1425.28
just can suddenly start to hate on

1422.13 --> 1427.7900000000002
someone for personal reasons and he

1425.28 --> 1430.5
doesn't stop doing that he keeps on

1427.79 --> 1434.84
doubling down and that's a terrible

1430.5 --> 1434.84
habit to have so

1436.16 --> 1441.78
but yeah something eventually he slow

1439.35 --> 1445.1399999999999
but it's just I don't know he's a

1441.78 --> 1451.41
character he's an interesting guy he's

1445.14 --> 1452.8200000000002
very well-spoken was just like I mean I

1451.41 --> 1453.98
don't hate Bob just because I disagree

1452.82 --> 1456.96
with him on gravity

1453.98 --> 1459.33
he's just so impassionate ly in love

1456.96 --> 1459.93
with gravity yeah it's Stockholm

1459.33 --> 1463.6799999999998
Syndrome

1459.93 --> 1466.25
don't take my gravity away nobody why

1463.68 --> 1469.23
he's basically doing what I kind of do

1466.25 --> 1471.48
except he is literally in love with it

1469.23 --> 1473.94
so he's saying odd but come on it works

1471.48 --> 1476.25
oh well it has to be there but I just

1473.94 --> 1478.74
say yeah it works really well you don't

1476.25 --> 1480.87
really need to take it away but you just

1478.74 --> 1485.49
got to be real about what it is and what

1480.87 --> 1489.9599999999998
it's not that's the difference he's not

1485.49 --> 1492.03
yeah you'll get there eventually you

1489.96 --> 1498.3600000000001
really it can take a long time to get

1492.03 --> 1501.84
over gravity these are so we so well

1498.36 --> 1504.7199999999998
well ingrained into our minds I agree

1501.84 --> 1506.9399999999998
it's difficult not to see it well we we

1504.72 --> 1514.5
get taught to work and reason with it

1506.94 --> 1516.69
all the time yeah when you realize when

1514.5 --> 1520.5
you realize that it's not even there it

1516.69 --> 1522.3600000000001
it's like it's like when the rose-tinted

1520.5 --> 1523.71
spectacles come off in a relationship we

1522.36 --> 1526.56
start to see the problems that are there

1523.71 --> 1527.88
that you didn't see initially he comes

1526.56 --> 1529.3799999999999
obvious that there's problems with

1527.88 --> 1531.6000000000001
gravity when she realized that it's not

1529.38 --> 1533.6100000000001
even there and then you radically

1531.6 --> 1535.74
changes the way that your mind is rewire

1533.61 --> 1537.27
you it rewires your mind and you

1535.74 --> 1538.77
instantly start looking for the but

1537.27 --> 1542.25
what's the it's never the alternative

1538.77 --> 1546.69
hold on no but hold on it's to just say

1542.25 --> 1549.69
it is not really there that's like you

1546.69 --> 1553.56
you don't really it's hard to even

1549.69 --> 1557.28
figure out what is going on basically by

1553.56 --> 1561.48
these divisions the this life is a

1557.28 --> 1563.76
parent force this equilibrium and only

1561.48 --> 1567.03
because we can't really trace the cause

1563.76 --> 1569.28
of it actually we are like pretty much

1567.03 --> 1571.71
in the dark about it concern

1569.28 --> 1574.02
the scientists people that try to figure

1571.71 --> 1575.82
it out are pretty much in the dark in

1574.02 --> 1581.1299999999999
relation to a lot of other things that

1575.82 --> 1586.9399999999998
are much easier to basically develop so

1581.13 --> 1592.1100000000001
it's like much harder to to deal with it

1586.94 --> 1594.66
yeah I think I think it's lost track

1592.11 --> 1596.6699999999998
when I was saying I think it's more

1594.66 --> 1599.13
interesting when you realize that see

1596.67 --> 1601.41
the problem is I think this is where me

1599.13 --> 1603.0200000000002
and Bob do agree but it's also where the

1601.41 --> 1605.43
balls raped the meanings of words

1603.02 --> 1607.11
because Bob and I actually agree that

1605.43 --> 1609.27
there may well be something else that's

1607.11 --> 1611.7299999999998
the the telenosis gravity but they're

1609.27 --> 1613.2
describing this gravity as a mass of

1611.73 --> 1615.09
tractive masses not really a must but

1613.2 --> 1617.91
you can think of it as a mass all men in

1615.09 --> 1619.77
space-time and now whatever there may be

1617.91 --> 1622.02
that's there is not what we're being

1619.77 --> 1623.91
told is and we're in the realms of

1622.02 --> 1625.95
spitballing that is outside of the

1623.91 --> 1627.5400000000002
current model and me and Bob agree on

1625.95 --> 1629.7
that in principle we agree that there is

1627.54 --> 1631.11
probably something else that is doing

1629.7 --> 1633.57
somewhere else that we're not aware of

1631.11 --> 1635.6999999999998
and it's matter at the Mac it's at the

1633.57 --> 1636.62
macro level right micro though it's

1635.7 --> 1639.15
really tiny

1636.62 --> 1641.79
exactly because we just don't know what

1639.15 --> 1644.19
causes it doesn't mean that there isn't

1641.79 --> 1647.04
something there it's just beyond our

1644.19 --> 1651.21
reach we just can't seem to grab it yeah

1647.04 --> 1654.1499999999999
I like it yes well the problem is

1651.21 --> 1656.28
because Bob describes it as a downwards

1654.15 --> 1658.77
acceleration force or gravity uses those

1656.28 --> 1660.6299999999999
words the ball is immediately invoked

1658.77 --> 1662.37
mass attractor must after and that's

1660.63 --> 1664.2900000000002
well it's dishonest and that's why I

1662.37 --> 1666.54
have to say Bob look if you're gonna use

1664.29 --> 1668.3999999999999
these words you have to realize that

1666.54 --> 1670.47
bowlers are gonna bastardize the

1668.4 --> 1672.45
meanings and they're gonna translate it

1670.47 --> 1674.1000000000001
into their own language and basically

1672.45 --> 1675.6000000000001
say that what we all agree in gravity

1674.1 --> 1681.54
then and we don't agree in gravity at

1675.6 --> 1684.87
all right so I would very much be for

1681.54 --> 1687.33
just renaming it the apparent force this

1684.87 --> 1689.76
equilibrium it's pretty clear what that

1687.33 --> 1692.72
means we can't even call it a powerful

1689.76 --> 1695.8799999999999
force no though now when it is well

1692.72 --> 1698.6100000000001
definitely a parents definitely a parent

1695.88 --> 1700.95
is just as apparent as the Sun disc

1698.61 --> 1702.4799999999998
which for which we have no physical

1700.95 --> 1705.39
proof it even is face

1702.48 --> 1707.4
ago so a parent definitely you can't

1705.39 --> 1709.1100000000001
just call it a force disequilibrium but

1707.4 --> 1713.3600000000001
it is definitely in a parent force

1709.11 --> 1717.03
equilibrium and even the official baller

1713.36 --> 1719.9399999999998
priests echo this kind of in between

1717.03 --> 1722.8799999999999
tongue and cheek they're saying it as

1719.94 --> 1725.19
well it's not reinforced what you can

1722.88 --> 1727.49
treat it as if it's for is it's a parent

1725.19 --> 1731.0700000000002
and true

1727.49 --> 1732.9
they also say that with all the mass

1731.07 --> 1735.84
attracting mass and all that [ __ ] I

1732.9 --> 1738.39
completely agree with you and but me and

1735.84 --> 1739.8899999999999
Bob agree on this point and we agree

1738.39 --> 1741.8090000000002
that there is possibly something else

1739.89 --> 1743.7
going on but the problem is the minute

1741.809 --> 1745.62
we describe it in the lingo that they

1743.7 --> 1747.1200000000001
use then they are all the ballers

1745.62 --> 1748.6789999999999
immediately say well its gravity comes

1747.12 --> 1750.33
like no no no that's not what we're

1748.679 --> 1751.71
saying stop taking our words into a

1750.33 --> 1754.799
totally different meaning that's not

1751.71 --> 1756.78
what we said right so then call it a

1754.799 --> 1759.09
parent force disequilibrium because

1756.78 --> 1762.809
that's much more narrow an apparent

1759.09 --> 1765.9289999999999
force this equilibrium is almost kind of

1762.809 --> 1767.82
implying a universal direction just by

1765.929 --> 1771.69
the way it's worded otherwise it would

1767.82 --> 1773.8799999999999
be to a central point and that is not it

1771.69 --> 1775.47
within the description so I would call

1773.88 --> 1777.6000000000001
it a parody apparent force

1775.47 --> 1781.95
disequilibrium because that kind of

1777.6 --> 1783.54
emphasizes the aberration of it well I'd

1781.95 --> 1785.82
rather call it our the relative density

1783.54 --> 1787.4099999999999
disequilibrium because it's a unique

1785.82 --> 1789.24
word or a unique phrase that we've

1787.41 --> 1791.13
coined that does make sense even though

1789.24 --> 1793.86
they don't exactly depth or that's

1791.13 --> 1798.419
hilarious that you would say because I

1793.86 --> 1801.36
already literally defend it publicly no

1798.419 --> 1804.99
relative density disequilibrium causes

1801.36 --> 1806.6999999999998
force we're on the same page but if

1804.99 --> 1810.179
that's too much of a month it's not the

1806.7 --> 1812.07
same thing now well it doesn't matter

1810.179 --> 1813.51
what we can call it is a downward

1812.07 --> 1815.97
acceleration force cuz they imply

1813.51 --> 1817.5
gravity immediately so we cannot call it

1815.97 --> 1819.3600000000001
anything like that where we might as

1817.5 --> 1820.679
well call it gada t because just to piss

1819.36 --> 1822.6299999999999
in their face because it needs to be

1820.679 --> 1824.8500000000001
contrasted it can't be compared you

1822.63 --> 1829.65
can't use the word acceleration because

1824.85 --> 1832.02
there is nothing actually the - nah tie

1829.65 --> 1834.63
in but yeah that apparent force

1832.02 --> 1835.879
disequilibrium that is a mechanical

1834.63 --> 1839.3290000000002
description it is a

1835.879 --> 1842.2089999999998
setting description yes no but that's

1839.329 --> 1844.9089999999999
the thing it is technical that is why it

1842.209 --> 1849.44
is the most correct it's it emphasizes

1844.909 --> 1850.94
the mystery of the setup well in any

1849.44 --> 1852.529
event they still steal the meaning of

1850.94 --> 1853.909
what we say in the context of what we're

1852.529 --> 1856.579
saying and if you say it's like that's

1853.909 --> 1858.979
got to be very hard for them because you

1856.579 --> 1861.709
can deflect it much easier because

1858.979 --> 1864.699
there's no words that tie into that line

1861.709 --> 1867.909
of reasoning if you say it like that

1864.699 --> 1870.799
so what we can agree is that whatever is

1867.909 --> 1872.69
what whatever it may or may not be in

1870.799 --> 1875.329
that context it was definitely not what

1872.69 --> 1881.929
we're being told we can agree on that

1875.329 --> 1883.729
yes so given that we can agree everybody

1881.929 --> 1885.739
go to my channel like watch that lamont

1883.729 --> 1888.079
recent video and basically ram it down

1885.739 --> 1890.69
their [ __ ] throats sorry Alan the

1888.079 --> 1892.999
reality is we can prove that relative

1890.69 --> 1894.919
density disequilibrium is causing

1892.999 --> 1897.3790000000001
movement right so that's the reason why

1894.919 --> 1899.2990000000002
the egg moved in the in the liquid when

1897.379 --> 1901.279
I did my test that's why the cherry

1899.299 --> 1903.859
tomato when you pull it out of its state

1901.279 --> 1905.659
of equilibrium either up or down it'll

1903.859 --> 1907.519
go back to that position and the

1905.659 --> 1909.5890000000002
movement is caused by the disequilibrium

1907.519 --> 1911.839
it's not being caused by gravity or

1909.589 --> 1912.979
buoyancy it's being caused by being in a

1911.839 --> 1914.9289999999999
state of disequilibrium

1912.979 --> 1917.739
I can prove it right right but there's a

1914.929 --> 1920.269
couple of more aspects even that are

1917.739 --> 1925.3990000000001
because you do not realize for example

1920.269 --> 1927.44
that a solid object in a surrounding of

1925.399 --> 1929.6899999999998
regular gas that's no longer can no

1927.44 --> 1931.249
longer maneuver because it's basically

1929.69 --> 1934.219
sitting on something there's no more

1931.249 --> 1935.929
falling room and it's perfectly level so

1934.219 --> 1939.789
it's not gonna roll to one side or

1935.929 --> 1943.1290000000001
something it is gonna cause pressure

1939.789 --> 1944.539
even though it's not moving and the

1943.129 --> 1946.399
pressure the pressures coming from the

1944.539 --> 1949.069
change in the density right now hold on

1946.399 --> 1952.879
it is still in this equilibrium but it

1949.069 --> 1954.799
has no maneuvering so that that force

1952.879 --> 1956.839
this equilibrium that the that the

1954.799 --> 1959.4189999999999
relative density disequilibrium because

1956.839 --> 1961.729
though is in relation to the medium that

1959.419 --> 1964.0990000000002
surrounds it not on where what it rests

1961.729 --> 1966.469
on what it rests is basically the

1964.099 --> 1968.749
maneuverability factor is also important

1966.469 --> 1969.8
to mention but it's gonna cause pressure

1968.749 --> 1972.53
because the

1969.8 --> 1974.75
relative density disequilibrium is still

1972.53 --> 1976.76
functioning but so that force is gonna

1974.75 --> 1979.22
then be expressed in pressure because

1976.76 --> 1983.24
that's the only way it can and that's

1979.22 --> 1988.33
gonna be constant do you see how the

1983.24 --> 1991.34
chain of things then work think so yeah

1988.33 --> 1994.82
it's funny how it's it's a framework

1991.34 --> 1997.73
it's just another type of framework just

1994.82 --> 2000.1799999999998
like gravity only difference is this

1997.73 --> 2004.33
framework is actually anchored on

2000.18 --> 2009.76
scientific proof that's why it's more

2004.33 --> 2016.6599999999999
viable that's why we're pursuing it yeah

2009.76 --> 2021.1
I like it but so yeah there's still a

2016.66 --> 2023.8300000000002
lot of training and work to basically

2021.1 --> 2025.81
defend what's going on

2023.83 --> 2028.6299999999999
concerning forces concerning the

2025.81 --> 2031.6599999999999
relative density this equilibria all

2028.63 --> 2036.5500000000002
that the effects the maneuverability all

2031.66 --> 2038.8600000000001
these factors it's it's gonna take some

2036.55 --> 2040.69
training I think I pretty much mastered

2038.86 --> 2043.6599999999999
it by now like it took like half a year

2040.69 --> 2046.81
I think I really get the entire

2043.66 --> 2048.73
framework of how yeah how it really can

2046.81 --> 2056.919
be explained pearly through relative

2048.73 --> 2058.659
density forces including yeah and yeah

2056.919 --> 2060.22
it's up to everyone else to start doing

2058.659 --> 2062.23
that as well and then the ballers

2060.22 --> 2064.6589999999997
absolutely have no chance because we

2062.23 --> 2066.97
will have widespread arguments

2064.659 --> 2070.57
explaining things all anchored within

2066.97 --> 2073.77
science and they will not they will be

2070.57 --> 2078.04
keep on clay they will be keep stuff

2073.77 --> 2080.5
they will stay stuck in claiming that

2078.04 --> 2084.37
there are experiments that prove gravity

2080.5 --> 2088.649
are mass and weight every time a spring

2084.37 --> 2088.649
tension pressure so

2089.74 --> 2095.7099999999996
yeah let's do this I'm ready yeah it's

2095.08 --> 2098.59
all good

2095.71 --> 2100.09
that's only gonna get better but I don't

2098.59 --> 2102.4300000000003
think people I don't think people are

2100.09 --> 2104.56
able to deny relative densities so what

2102.43 --> 2105.49
is a thing at the minute I don't think

2104.56 --> 2107.02
you can go because you don't have to

2105.49 --> 2108.97
disprove the science there because I'm

2107.02 --> 2111.28
trying to do my own bit where I prove

2108.97 --> 2112.6899999999996
what I'm claiming and it seems to be

2111.28 --> 2114.19
working but if you're just gonna

2112.69 --> 2115.54
flippantly dismiss it then that makes

2114.19 --> 2116.89
your science denial but you have to

2115.54 --> 2118.93
demonstrate that there is something

2116.89 --> 2120.46
wrong and prove that there is something

2118.93 --> 2121.72
wrong because I don't think that you can

2120.46 --> 2123.13
go much further than this this is the

2121.72 --> 2132.4599999999996
end of the line that is the cause and

2123.13 --> 2136.54
the effect demonstrated also by the way

2132.46 --> 2138.55
to double what I just explained about

2136.54 --> 2140.2
relative density in relation to the

2138.55 --> 2142.84
medium that it would cause pressure if

2140.2 --> 2145.48
there's a lack of maneuverability that

2142.84 --> 2148.33
also counts for the other way around

2145.48 --> 2150.97
like a big helium balloon that would

2148.33 --> 2153.8199999999997
really push up especially if you've

2150.97 --> 2156.3689999999997
thickened the pressure in the room then

2153.82 --> 2159.4300000000003
any scale it will be pushing at it would

2156.369 --> 2162.34
experience the same thing if it's

2159.43 --> 2166.0
basically stuck no more maneuverability

2162.34 --> 2168.28
its rel dance at relative density this

2166.0 --> 2171.55
equilibrium because of the medium will

2168.28 --> 2177.1000000000004
make it cause a constant pressure again

2171.55 --> 2181.1800000000003
in the same fashion how about that try

2177.1 --> 2182.68
to do that with gravity you know that's

2181.18 --> 2184.81
a little bit more difficult than you

2182.68 --> 2186.91
yeah most people can't even do it I

2184.81 --> 2190.18
could do it but I just don't because I

2186.91 --> 2192.6299999999997
don't want to sharpen their tools at

2190.18 --> 2192.6299999999997
this point

2193.59 --> 2196.5
sometimes I think that they'll do

2195.12 --> 2198.39
anything anyway they'll just be [ __ ]

2196.5 --> 2200.61
my weapons they'll just be [ __ ]

2198.39 --> 2203.19
anyway well that's their fallback

2200.61 --> 2204.7200000000003
position yeah

2203.19 --> 2208.23
oh and a big shout-out to Sean Haugh

2204.72 --> 2211.1699999999996
fraud audio guy he claims out have any

2208.23 --> 2213.18
tracking yeah well he claimed that the

2211.17 --> 2214.62
previous video of mine not the one I've

2213.18 --> 2217.29
just released the one that was cried -

2214.62 --> 2218.39
it yesterday you clay but I stole it

2217.29 --> 2221.1
from somewhere

2218.39 --> 2223.2599999999998
because I don't know what I don't know

2221.1 --> 2224.49
why he thought that but he said it and I

2223.26 --> 2226.11
called him on it and he hasn't got

2224.49 --> 2227.97
because it was my content it's our

2226.11 --> 2230.27
content it's original content it's ours

2227.97 --> 2232.7599999999998
right we made it for this purpose um

2230.27 --> 2234.66
Sean what are some huh

2232.76 --> 2236.8500000000004
well he's trying to create a distraction

2234.66 --> 2239.3999999999996
so that people follow the destruction I

2236.85 --> 2240.93
missed the point of the video so he's

2239.4 --> 2242.81
taking one for the team really but he's

2240.93 --> 2245.73
just being a dishonest work anyway so

2242.81 --> 2249.47
shouts - Sean Holford audio guy gotta

2245.73 --> 2255.39
love him definitely shout out retracted

2249.47 --> 2260.7799999999997
yeah definitely okay I think yeah

2255.39 --> 2263.4
Jessica wants to come on hey my ladder

2260.78 --> 2266.34
so that was your bleeping noise in the

2263.4 --> 2270.06
background what no no it's something

2266.34 --> 2270.6600000000003
bleep no no you know all right I didn't

2270.06 --> 2278.5499999999997
hear that

2270.66 --> 2288.14
oh no it was me yeah okay that's

2278.55 --> 2293.32
I got right to do that okay

2288.14 --> 2295.6
[Music]

2293.32 --> 2302.07
yeah if anyone else wants to join as

2295.6 --> 2302.0699999999997
well how did I want let me know on skype

2303.27 --> 2307.77
rather do a few are what is it well oh

2306.0 --> 2313.33
hello Jessica

2307.77 --> 2315.7
hey somebody just woke up I was like oh

2313.33 --> 2321.0699999999997
my god cuz I have to go in a little bit

2315.7 --> 2322.72
so I okay Jessica the most important

2321.07 --> 2323.6200000000003
question of the day have you seen my

2322.72 --> 2328.4199999999996
latest video

2323.62 --> 2329.2599999999998
I haven't watch it later on you need to

2328.42 --> 2331.21
it's really good

2329.26 --> 2337.03
ballers are gonna hate really bad

2331.21 --> 2338.41
they're gonna hate it doesn't matter how

2337.03 --> 2340.3300000000004
much since you're making you're just

2338.41 --> 2344.6499999999996
they're gonna continue to get sugar and

2340.33 --> 2346.21
say oh this is stupid and yeah I've got

2344.65 --> 2349.87
actually someone crediting me for doing

2346.21 --> 2353.23
more science than conspiracy caps that's

2349.87 --> 2354.43
not really hard no it stopped what given

2353.23 --> 2357.3
the East supposed to be the science guy

2354.43 --> 2360.2799999999997
right exactly

2357.3 --> 2363.34
remembering remembering his earlier like

2360.28 --> 2366.55
attempts to explain gas particle

2363.34 --> 2369.19
sticking to a ball yeah he did it with

2366.55 --> 2371.05
his bloody whiteboard Nick doc without

2369.19 --> 2376.2400000000002
the balloon there is no pressure and

2371.05 --> 2379.15
that came back to haunt him I think he

2376.24 --> 2385.2599999999998
was literally improvising I think that

2379.15 --> 2385.26
guy is used to really embrace this stuff

2386.25 --> 2390.28
I can't explain okay so let me just do

2389.44 --> 2391.9
this what it was like a

2390.28 --> 2394.57
spur-of-the-moment type thing like he

2391.9 --> 2407.17
just had to throw it in there like I

2394.57 --> 2409.1800000000003
don't realize yeah so definitely watch

2407.17 --> 2412.12
obviously like on then I get a chance

2409.18 --> 2413.71
I'll go and look at it yeah you should

2412.12 --> 2414.94
write Alan what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

2413.71 --> 2416.83
drop because I need to get nip to the

2414.94 --> 2419.59
loop I need to move the vehicle rattling

2416.83 --> 2421.27
yeah gonna get myself a broom and then

2419.59 --> 2422.71
I'll be back online but and by the time

2421.27 --> 2424.54
I've done that it's gonna be like it's

2422.71 --> 2425.77
how it'll be time for Nathan so I'm

2424.54 --> 2426.7889999999998
gonna drop hutch to see you in Nathan's

2425.77 --> 2429.64
and I shall catch

2426.789 --> 2431.949
in a bit okay alright yeah thanks for

2429.64 --> 2434.739
coming on and sharing that with us

2431.949 --> 2435.579
come on no worries alright in a bit see

2434.739 --> 2445.989
you later

2435.579 --> 2448.2290000000003
alright so I'm fine I'm actually gonna

2445.989 --> 2452.0190000000002
get like surprisingly even though I was

2448.229 --> 2455.5589999999997
like on on discord for a little bit like

2452.019 --> 2459.189
I took a break from go what are you

2455.559 --> 2460.719
doing no no it was fine I clearly I've

2459.189 --> 2462.489
been on here and I haven't I haven't

2460.719 --> 2464.89
allowed myself to get like trigger or

2462.489 --> 2466.839
blow up like I did before but like I'm

2464.89 --> 2468.759
just basically like if I'm in a

2466.839 --> 2471.13
conversation if I'm locked on to someone

2468.759 --> 2473.65
I stay in that conversation I don't pay

2471.13 --> 2475.179
attention to the other stuff and that

2473.65 --> 2477.489
helps a lot because like people will

2475.179 --> 2479.349
just be talking in blah blah blah late

2477.489 --> 2481.66
if you know when that happens I'm just

2479.349 --> 2483.339
like okay let me just focus on this the

2481.66 --> 2485.739
point that I'm trying to make and when I

2483.339 --> 2487.689
do that and then I have the person on

2485.739 --> 2490.63
the ropes then it helps but when I start

2487.689 --> 2493.5989999999997
to get angry I thought too easily though

2490.63 --> 2495.609
wasn't so bad really so I started doing

2493.599 --> 2497.1090000000004
that and that helps a lot and then it

2495.609 --> 2501.419
also helps when you do have someone else

2497.109 --> 2503.2889999999998
like right the hand was simple or Amazo

2501.419 --> 2505.239
and what I was saying and I was

2503.289 --> 2506.679
supporting him and opener so we were

2505.239 --> 2508.929
going back and forth you know we weren't

2506.679 --> 2510.819
just on our own if we were it would have

2508.929 --> 2512.14
been a lot harder is this lately there

2510.819 --> 2516.15
was like four of them I know it's just

2512.14 --> 2518.6189999999997
the two of us and that's really funny is

2516.15 --> 2522.9
even dawn was kind of agreeing with this

2518.619 --> 2525.369
a certain but I was like wait more often

2522.9 --> 2528.1890000000003
yeah it's because this is like because

2525.369 --> 2529.7490000000003
the arguments make too much sense it's

2528.189 --> 2531.459
not like we're not making sense I

2529.749 --> 2533.6189999999997
couldn't it were saying was convoluted

2531.459 --> 2536.169
no but look Don has already reconciled

2533.619 --> 2538.509
with that he just isn't smart enough to

2536.169 --> 2541.509
really get a lot of it like really he

2538.509 --> 2544.809
really does get it that he doesn't get

2541.509 --> 2547.839
it so he just says honestly not even as

2544.809 --> 2550.2690000000002
a joke like yeah I just believe it but

2547.839 --> 2552.7889999999998
he does still have some moral senses and

2550.269 --> 2556.209
you will just defend people almost like

2552.789 --> 2558.8190000000004
a good Christian sort of when he just

2556.209 --> 2559.39
notices people are off or behaving like

2558.819 --> 2561.819
terrible

2559.39 --> 2564.519
and being deceptive that's when he'll

2561.819 --> 2568.72
actually help you out it's weird

2564.519 --> 2570.3689999999997
the guy's weird he's really sweet like

2568.72 --> 2572.6699999999996
you he actually have a real he seems

2570.369 --> 2578.319
like a really nice person he's just yeah

2572.67 --> 2580.569
he's okay you know like there's not like

2578.319 --> 2582.19
he's cool like you there's not what you

2580.569 --> 2585.519
can really get out of a conversation

2582.19 --> 2587.619
like that like you can't get to you know

2585.519 --> 2590.14
I don't know what it is ladies

2587.619 --> 2592.089
he said he smokes weed a lot like more

2590.14 --> 2593.91
than he probably should so maybe that's

2592.089 --> 2597.279
a part of it I don't know but that's

2593.91 --> 2599.71
like when he's like I don't really feel

2597.279 --> 2602.079
like not saying that if you smoke a lot

2599.71 --> 2604.7200000000003
of weed yours like you can't get things

2602.079 --> 2607.0
it's just that oh like if you like you

2604.72 --> 2609.0989999999997
were saying it too much of it can cause

2607.0 --> 2611.17
he's just not really meant to think you

2609.099 --> 2614.589
know no but it all depends on what

2611.17 --> 2616.42
you're doing right if you don't have

2614.589 --> 2618.5099999999998
anything to look forward to if you have

2616.42 --> 2623.38
no focus then you'll become just

2618.51 --> 2625.029
literally dumb but right yeah if you

2623.38 --> 2626.829
have real things to do then it can

2625.029 --> 2630.519
actually help you focus it it all

2626.829 --> 2643.21
depends on how you arrange your life to

2630.519 --> 2644.7099999999996
be what I need something like like on

2643.21 --> 2646.299
things I need to do like I really need

2644.71 --> 2650.65
help to like just because we're not

2646.299 --> 2652.269
cause like I said I tend to okay I gotta

2650.65 --> 2655.359
do is I gotta today I do this and I get

2652.269 --> 2658.089
overwhelmed like instead of like if I if

2655.359 --> 2659.619
I finish one thing at a time and light

2658.089 --> 2663.0589999999997
remember remember to focus on finishing

2659.619 --> 2665.319
that one task then I can you know

2663.059 --> 2669.3390000000004
efficiently and some days I'm able to do

2665.319 --> 2671.5
that but other days unexpected stuff

2669.339 --> 2674.8289999999997
just kind of says I can't really control

2671.5 --> 2677.17
I forgot and I have to and that letting

2674.829 --> 2681.7000000000003
that happen basically and maybe a little

2677.17 --> 2684.4
cannabis will help you know but it's it

2681.7 --> 2687.549
so a little more to get it where I am

2684.4 --> 2690.2200000000003
it's mostly discipline it's I could you

2687.549 --> 2691.82
could compare it as having like a little

2690.22 --> 2694.7
anxious dog

2691.82 --> 2698.8700000000003
and the dog like is always gonna be

2694.7 --> 2700.73
making a hassle being very like the out

2698.87 --> 2702.5299999999997
of control so you're just gonna have to

2700.73 --> 2705.8
be stricter you're gonna have to keep it

2702.53 --> 2707.7200000000003
under control and then if you are

2705.8 --> 2710.15
persistent with that then things calm

2707.72 --> 2713.06
down it becomes unsteady but under

2710.15 --> 2716.89
control that's that's how I would treat

2713.06 --> 2716.89
it it's our right to read it with myself

2719.83 --> 2725.18
that's something that just it takes

2722.42 --> 2728.09
practice it takes a lot of you got like

2725.18 --> 2732.2
you have to really want that result that

2728.09 --> 2734.48
you get from get from improving with

2732.2 --> 2735.77
euro we're getting things done and

2734.48 --> 2737.78
everything like that you have to lay its

2735.77 --> 2739.28
egg if you're really determined to get

2737.78 --> 2742.25
to that point where you can just bam bam

2739.28 --> 2744.7400000000002
down then yeah like then that open that

2742.25 --> 2747.23
really oh yeah that's yeah but you can't

2744.74 --> 2749.3599999999997
really guarantee that that's sort of

2747.23 --> 2752.45
cool that's the exception actually so

2749.36 --> 2758.1800000000003
you gotta learn a way to basically do it

2752.45 --> 2761.1099999999997
and then stop your mind from yeah using

2758.18 --> 2764.72
the tension to distract you

2761.11 --> 2768.38
he's gotta like focus on the focusing

2764.72 --> 2773.0
and that can be done through is like a

2768.38 --> 2777.4100000000003
sub meditation yes yes exactly focus on

2773.0 --> 2780.71
I was gonna say that that's what you

2777.41 --> 2782.0899999999997
have to do it's just you know but it

2780.71 --> 2783.92
does it does take time does take

2782.09 --> 2786.58
practice like Serb there are certain

2783.92 --> 2789.08
things that do get better with age like

2786.58 --> 2790.67
something like that's and I can't stay

2789.08 --> 2792.7999999999997
for everyone but a lot of things didn't

2790.67 --> 2794.33
like from what I've seen the pattern is

2792.8 --> 2796.52
that older people aren't really really

2794.33 --> 2799.37
good with routine they're they're better

2796.52 --> 2801.68
at routine tasks and like younger people

2799.37 --> 2803.41
you know from my experience like but of

2801.68 --> 2807.5299999999997
course there's exceptions to that and

2803.41 --> 2810.7
everything oh yeah you know I think as

2807.53 --> 2814.1600000000003
I've always been easily distracted by oh

2810.7 --> 2816.3199999999997
by most of things or just not just that

2814.16 --> 2818.2
but like I there are certain things I

2816.32 --> 2819.32
can lock my cell phone and focus on

2818.2 --> 2822.5299999999997
intensively

2819.32 --> 2824.36
oh but like what if it's if there's a

2822.53 --> 2825.11
stagnation I can't but what just sitting

2824.36 --> 2827.69
in silence

2825.11 --> 2830.42
not even a it's even hard for me to

2827.69 --> 2832.79
silence my mind like and everything like

2830.42 --> 2834.08
that and focus on just like you're

2832.79 --> 2836.75
trying to find that one thing to focus

2834.08 --> 2838.34
on and embellish on that that's really

2836.75 --> 2840.23
hard for me to do because I'll think of

2838.34 --> 2842.69
one thing and it'll lead to another at

2840.23 --> 2845.45
least right but that's but that's an

2842.69 --> 2849.08
addictive process it is basically the

2845.45 --> 2853.9399999999996
gushing of energy that makes you move

2849.08 --> 2855.5
into that mode because there's yeah it's

2853.94 --> 2858.05
like the inner pressure of the inner

2855.5 --> 2859.91
mind that can't really properly manifest

2858.05 --> 2865.52
the energy and so then you stir it

2859.91 --> 2867.62
starts to come out in a tick yeah yeah

2865.52 --> 2870.2599999999998
you gotta be careful with that because

2867.62 --> 2872.54
that'll also drain you down from

2870.26 --> 2875.96
actually doing it in another way so I

2872.54 --> 2878.75
don't know it's it's a it's a tough

2875.96 --> 2883.43
thing to deal with that but it can

2878.75 --> 2885.77
absolutely be done of course yeah you

2883.43 --> 2889.22
just gotta like it is really almost like

2885.77 --> 2893.21
you gotta start literally dealing with

2889.22 --> 2898.16
the actual tension itself and try to see

2893.21 --> 2902.81
like if you can like reroute it as it

2898.16 --> 2906.41
manifests to prevent making you do the

2902.81 --> 2909.11
things that will get you to then go into

2906.41 --> 2911.2999999999997
that loop and start spiraling basically

2909.11 --> 2914.96
in in a non constructive way in a

2911.3 --> 2917.0
disruptive way to yourself and I don't

2914.96 --> 2919.31
know it's the only way I can describe it

2917.0 --> 2922.33
but it's always about when it arrives

2919.31 --> 2926.9
just immediately start working on it

2922.33 --> 2930.59
just know that makes a lot of sense

2926.9 --> 2932.62
um it's just like like a noose anyway it

2930.59 --> 2936.7400000000002
definitely takes practice and it takes

2932.62 --> 2939.08
the it's a fact like when you have a

2936.74 --> 2941.6899999999996
goal that you are trying to reach you

2939.08 --> 2943.52
know that it's necessary for you to

2941.69 --> 2947.0
before you take it over this obstacle

2943.52 --> 2948.59
and everything like you then like even

2947.0 --> 2950.09
if it's you know there are certain

2948.59 --> 2952.1600000000003
things that we end up developing that

2950.09 --> 2956.21
just looking a part of our personality

2952.16 --> 2958.0299999999997
so that's why you can't always certain

2956.21 --> 2959.92
things you you always can't control

2958.03 --> 2962.71
like when you're able to overcome them

2959.92 --> 2964.42
in those moments it's like when you you

2962.71 --> 2967.6
know let stuff like someone who's scared

2964.42 --> 2969.52
of let me give a good analogy okay like

2967.6 --> 2971.38
you're you're scared of spiders right

2969.52 --> 2973.45
okay so you and then a situation you're

2971.38 --> 2975.9700000000003
trying to avoid spires you're like okay

2973.45 --> 2979.93
I'm just gonna little it was say there

2975.97 --> 2983.7599999999998
comes an instance where this is what let

2979.93 --> 2986.8599999999997
go you have a friend in the abolutely

2983.76 --> 2990.9700000000003
that's not a good to go let's stop

2986.86 --> 2995.38
interrupting yourself no it's not funny

2990.97 --> 2997.45
it's not funny no that's that I'm sorry

2995.38 --> 2997.84
I I just wanna make sure it's making

2997.45 --> 3000.6299999999997
sense

2997.84 --> 3006.2400000000002
what's all this light or that it's a

3000.63 --> 3007.9500000000003
good okay so okay so I'm saying like so

3006.24 --> 3010.04
let's say that spider like it's a big

3007.95 --> 3013.1
black widow spider on your friend and

3010.04 --> 3015.06
and that is like in that instance like

3013.1 --> 3017.06
normally he would run away from the

3015.06 --> 3020.91
spider but in that instance you have to

3017.06 --> 3022.98
like you have to deal with that spider

3020.91 --> 3024.87
you have in order to get it off your

3022.98 --> 3026.25
friend basically like you have to but it

3024.87 --> 3029.2799999999997
may not be aware so you have to like

3026.25 --> 3030.48
quickly like remove the spider even

3029.28 --> 3031.5600000000004
though you're terrified in like oh my

3030.48 --> 3034.77
god I don't even want to deal with this

3031.56 --> 3036.75
you go ahead and you do it like even

3034.77 --> 3038.46
though you're even though you're afraid

3036.75 --> 3041.19
even though that wasn't possible for you

3038.46 --> 3044.01
and you so like it like the situations

3041.19 --> 3046.11
matter like when when the situation

3044.01 --> 3048.36
comes to be that's when you have to deal

3046.11 --> 3049.7400000000002
with that that thing that's always

3048.36 --> 3052.29
blocking you that thing that you have

3049.74 --> 3056.7
trouble with right like buttah phobia is

3052.29 --> 3058.68
always about you so if you're phobic for

3056.7 --> 3060.93
spiders then as soon as you see the

3058.68 --> 3061.9199999999996
spider it becomes all about your you

3060.93 --> 3065.6099999999997
being in danger

3061.92 --> 3067.6800000000003
that's the sensation but if yeah like

3065.61 --> 3070.26
you described it's on some on your

3067.68 --> 3073.2
friend and you really like that friend

3070.26 --> 3075.57
then you can actually take the

3073.2 --> 3078.96
opportunity you it can doesn't always

3075.57 --> 3081.1200000000003
happen a lot of people just cower but

3078.96 --> 3084.09
it's possible to then just say no I

3081.12 --> 3086.19
instead of protecting me the energy

3084.09 --> 3088.6800000000003
shifts to protecting your friend and

3086.19 --> 3091.62
that's a different type of energy and

3088.68 --> 3093.7799999999997
that actually brings out bravery and

3091.62 --> 3097.41
sadly where before you were locked into

3093.78 --> 3099.3900000000003
this self-directing fear spiral you can

3097.41 --> 3103.2
suddenly take action against it as if

3099.39 --> 3105.96
it's nothing that happens but it's

3103.2 --> 3108.4199999999996
because of our focus of the energy what

3105.96 --> 3111.11
it does to you how it if you get into

3108.42 --> 3115.32
some type of default position like fear

3111.11 --> 3117.1200000000003
very self-directed but if then the focus

3115.32 --> 3121.52
becomes different then suddenly that

3117.12 --> 3125.3399999999997
mechanism doesn't work the same for it

3121.52 --> 3127.2
right yeah this yeah that's almost right

3125.34 --> 3129.27
bestest always trying to say in that and

3127.2 --> 3131.8799999999997
that does that doesn't make sense let's

3129.27 --> 3133.5
all you do have certain habits you're

3131.88 --> 3136.83
trying to overcome you can break those

3133.5 --> 3138.39
habits by put like putting your focus

3136.83 --> 3140.88
and what it is that you're trying to

3138.39 --> 3143.19
achieve like you you can't keep allowing

3140.88 --> 3144.9300000000003
it to the future every single time never

3143.19 --> 3148.08
know doesn't even have to be on what you

3144.93 --> 3151.77
try to achieve it is a upon the the

3148.08 --> 3154.14
motivation angle is very important what

3151.77 --> 3156.54
is arriving not what are you technically

3154.14 --> 3160.17
trying to accomplish but what is driving

3156.54 --> 3164.16
you to do it and how can that overcome

3160.17 --> 3166.23
any personal obstacles basically so the

3164.16 --> 3168.6299999999997
more motivated you are the more brave

3166.23 --> 3178.44
you will be in the face of whatever

3168.63 --> 3181.29
you're facing you know that's so like

3178.44 --> 3184.68
that's why it definitely just it's at

3181.29 --> 3185.88
that like it becomes yeah but I guess

3184.68 --> 3188.5499999999997
you just have to make it a habit you

3185.88 --> 3192.0
have to make that you're not just a

3188.55 --> 3195.32
habit a constant a discipline isn't a

3192.0 --> 3199.35
discipline it's not a habit is continual

3195.32 --> 3202.17
right so almost like there's Lich I when

3199.35 --> 3204.27
I get strict with myself with these

3202.17 --> 3207.03
types of issue when they slip back for

3204.27 --> 3209.67
example I treated literally like a demon

3207.03 --> 3212.34
is like taking control of me and as soon

3209.67 --> 3214.44
as I noticed like that like oh [ __ ] that

3212.34 --> 3217.4
behavior is gonna is trying to come

3214.44 --> 3219.55
forth then immediately like in a

3217.4 --> 3222.9100000000003
microsecond I just dish

3219.55 --> 3225.2200000000003
like change the energies around block it

3222.91 --> 3230.3199999999997
prevent it from coming through and

3225.22 --> 3233.95
trying to take over and it works really

3230.32 --> 3238.84
well but you it's continual like forever

3233.95 --> 3241.0899999999997
it's just part of what I've become and

3238.84 --> 3243.7000000000003
it'll always be there but if you keep on

3241.09 --> 3246.1000000000004
strict then it it'll become weaker and

3243.7 --> 3248.23
weaker and eventually you barely even

3246.1 --> 3251.62
have to pay attention but then you get

3248.23 --> 3254.26
the risk of them becoming deluded like

3251.62 --> 3257.3199999999997
there's nothing there and then getting

3254.26 --> 3260.9700000000003
seduced into behaviors again and then it

3257.32 --> 3265.21
will definitely try to rear its head so

3260.97 --> 3267.49
that's that's always the backlash of

3265.21 --> 3269.05
once you build up you've overcome

3267.49 --> 3271.39
obstacles then you get the luxury

3269.05 --> 3276.9700000000003
problems and those are those tend to

3271.39 --> 3279.94
practically be a lot harder it's like

3276.97 --> 3281.5
you so what are you saying it's like

3279.94 --> 3284.23
when you when you do get to that certain

3281.5 --> 3286.57
point you've gotten really really far

3284.23 --> 3287.92
when you it's kind of like you can't

3286.57 --> 3289.57
like you're climbing up it's kind of

3287.92 --> 3291.4
like climbing up a mountain as I way you

3289.57 --> 3294.31
mean you're climbing you get to a

3291.4 --> 3296.23
certain height you know so far than well

3294.31 --> 3298.54
said you trip and you end up falling and

3296.23 --> 3302.47
crashing all all the way back down like

3298.54 --> 3306.49
that can ya very metaphorical but yeah

3302.47 --> 3310.1499999999996
the whole thing yes but more important

3306.49 --> 3312.64
is that originally like when you're poor

3310.15 --> 3315.1600000000003
for example you really try to work your

3312.64 --> 3316.5699999999997
way up and then you know what's out

3315.16 --> 3319.54
there you're in the middle of it it's

3316.57 --> 3321.8500000000004
slapping you in the face but as you grow

3319.54 --> 3323.2599999999998
overcome these obstacles event yeah

3321.85 --> 3326.02
you'll still have them as memory have

3323.26 --> 3328.51
this oversight but if you're no longer

3326.02 --> 3329.83
in there only you have only your

3328.51 --> 3331.21
memories you don't really know how

3329.83 --> 3337.7799999999997
everything's changing in the meantime

3331.21 --> 3341.71
and eventually yeah it will find its way

3337.78 --> 3344.88
back because you've overcame it and then

3341.71 --> 3347.86
lost track of it because you overcame it

3344.88 --> 3351.4300000000003
like the reflex no longer has a function

3347.86 --> 3353.05
because it just went away but then you

3351.43 --> 3355.1499999999996
risk that it'll come back

3353.05 --> 3359.65
again and especially at unexpected

3355.15 --> 3362.08
moments and yeah gradual and it's not

3359.65 --> 3365.86
just sunny blah or maybe it will if you

3362.08 --> 3369.37
like snap but it's weird oh yeah my god

3365.86 --> 3372.9100000000003
it does you know I know that was a one

3369.37 --> 3375.64
two example but it's like within a more

3372.91 --> 3378.19
in a more on specific sense it's like

3375.64 --> 3381.04
you it can also be a certain chain of

3378.19 --> 3382.87
events that can send you crashing down

3381.04 --> 3385.84
when you have made it to a certain point

3382.87 --> 3387.3399999999997
that's why you have so that's why even

3385.84 --> 3389.53
when those money and you may not be all

3387.34 --> 3390.8500000000004
the way down or you may not like start

3389.53 --> 3393.25
all the way from the beginning again

3390.85 --> 3395.71
so for some people that may happen and

3393.25 --> 3398.56
for something that may not but the whole

3395.71 --> 3399.85
point is is that you wouldn't know when

3398.56 --> 3402.73
you get to those points maybe the

3399.85 --> 3404.5299999999997
situations like oh yeah I know you you

3402.73 --> 3406.72
did it you went there and even though

3404.53 --> 3409.8100000000004
you came back down you know what it's it

3406.72 --> 3411.16
for you to get to that point so you've

3409.81 --> 3414.7599999999998
already been through it you've already

3411.16 --> 3416.5899999999997
experienced it so it's like you didn't

3414.76 --> 3417.55
you know like for some people maybe like

3416.59 --> 3419.32
oh I don't want to go through this again

3417.55 --> 3422.6800000000003
but because you know what to expect

3419.32 --> 3424.42
you're like okay I things won't seem as

3422.68 --> 3426.52
difficult as they were when you were

3424.42 --> 3430.0
going through it and like what a fresh

3426.52 --> 3431.89
mind or fresh like fresh understanding

3430.0 --> 3433.84
of everything now you're like okay now I

3431.89 --> 3437.5899999999997
know what to do and I know what to avoid

3433.84 --> 3439.4500000000003
this time I know what it takes to well I

3437.59 --> 3441.31
know what I did wrong here you can

3439.45 --> 3443.3199999999997
observe you can observe what is it that

3441.31 --> 3447.85
caused you to you have that breakdown in

3443.32 --> 3449.26
the first place yeah well so it was like

3447.85 --> 3452.77
it's a combination of those things

3449.26 --> 3454.9900000000002
mm-hmm well learning spirits it's weird

3452.77 --> 3456.97
yeah I think I'm taking it kind of

3454.99 --> 3459.7299999999996
literal but when I think when you said

3456.97 --> 3462.31
like going up a mountain if that was the

3459.73 --> 3464.08
first time I definitely had it

3462.31 --> 3466.5099999999998
completely I would definitely have a

3464.08 --> 3470.95
completely different feel on it because

3466.51 --> 3473.5600000000004
I had no real feeling for how tough it

3470.95 --> 3475.99
would be at the beginning and then I

3473.56 --> 3479.32
would be almost terrified at the end

3475.99 --> 3482.1099999999997
because yeah it would be seemingly

3479.32 --> 3484.27
probably too much to me but if I do it

3482.11 --> 3486.4
again then it would be completely

3484.27 --> 3489.43
different because the start my word

3486.4 --> 3491.2000000000003
remember it all be much more nervous

3489.43 --> 3493.21
about it because I have much more

3491.2 --> 3495.97
insight on how tough it's really going

3493.21 --> 3499.75
to be but because of that mindset

3495.97 --> 3502.75
because I'm basically more cautious not

3499.75 --> 3504.91
wandering as much with my mind then in

3502.75 --> 3507.13
the end it will actually be a lot easier

3504.91 --> 3509.859
because I'm now mentally prepared for

3507.13 --> 3515.73
how tough it actually turned turns out

3509.859 --> 3520.5989999999997
to be so that's yeah that's my

3515.73 --> 3521.95
reflection upon all that right and

3520.599 --> 3524.799
that's a good way and that's a good way

3521.95 --> 3527.74
to look at any any challenge any

3524.799 --> 3530.02
obstacle like you've um you make it when

3527.74 --> 3531.6699999999996
you make it physical then you're a looks

3530.02 --> 3534.819
it like really tackle it in a certain

3531.67 --> 3538.27
way you make it entity as opposed to

3534.819 --> 3540.549
just being um so conscious in your in

3538.27 --> 3543.16
your mind you know it's just all these

3540.549 --> 3545.109
things all mixed around all over the

3543.16 --> 3547.93
place I mean combine those things

3545.109 --> 3550.21
together and make it into a to an actual

3547.93 --> 3555.0389999999998
thing you're trying to tackle that hope

3550.21 --> 3560.02
so alright yeah oversight over what

3555.039 --> 3562.42
comes into an entire endeavor it helps a

3560.02 --> 3564.809
lot if you have actual experience with

3562.42 --> 3568.51
it to complete it because it helps you

3564.809 --> 3569.799
in your focus during the process because

3568.51 --> 3571.9900000000002
you have an oversight you have a

3569.799 --> 3575.44
framework you can put yourself within

3571.99 --> 3578.02
that framework and basically realize

3575.44 --> 3580.39
okay this is how how far we've taken

3578.02 --> 3583.71
this is how far it could take because

3580.39 --> 3587.71
you have some kind of feel for it now

3583.71 --> 3591.539
well anyways I think I'm gonna round out

3587.71 --> 3594.789
the show because it's almost 3 o'clock

3591.539 --> 3599.529
