H Bob Saget fan really Arc

show well there's a good chance that you

839.92 --> 844.68
were probably banned on this channel

850.839 --> 856.12
anyway with a name like that

867.0 --> 873.16
uh yeah would work

869.48 --> 873.16
of course yeah it's I

875.839 --> 881.399
mean they're like at an exponential drop

879.16 --> 883.4399999999999
and so they have to like the hysteria

881.399 --> 885.16
they have to keep pumping out to

883.44 --> 889.5600000000001
distract away

885.16 --> 889.56
from the more increasingly

890.88 --> 897.199
obvious wait

892.92 --> 897.199
that's let me try to reconstruct

897.68 --> 902.3199999999999
that

899.399 --> 904.24
it's getting exponentially worse and so

902.32 --> 909.0400000000001
the distractions that they throw out

904.24 --> 914.0
have to be exponentially more egregious

909.04 --> 914.0
and more quickly following one another

915.199 --> 923.399
up until it's like this nonstop Panic

920.519 --> 927.6
Fest that was just because it's meant to

923.399 --> 931.519
paralyze people specifically to paralyze

927.6 --> 933.8000000000001
them so they don't do anything and don't

931.519 --> 933.8

goofball from TV yeah from Full House

1035.919 --> 1041.48

1038.439 --> 1043.8390000000002
Video the guy is always like completely

1041.48 --> 1046.919
off tone with

1043.839 --> 1050.3999999999999
everything and he likes that he's a

1046.919 --> 1050.4
freaking weirdo

1060.0 --> 1065.64
and also did like standof comedy beside

1062.76 --> 1065.64
that which was

1072.78 --> 1076.22
[Music]

1077.4 --> 1080.4

[Music]

1137.32 --> 1140.32
that

1141.919 --> 1147.88
yeah woodworking gy Bear yeah no that's

1143.799 --> 1151.2
a good point but you see the thing

1147.88 --> 1155.919
is the more tense It all becomes the

1151.2 --> 1155.919
more pan in panic they

1156.159 --> 1163.24
get it's like the rolls weirdly flipped

1159.32 --> 1167.24
there it's something really surreal that

1163.24 --> 1170.2
happens because well it stops

1167.24 --> 1173.28
working on the public that they try to

1170.2 --> 1175.48
enthrall and manipulate with

1173.28 --> 1178.52
it and then

1175.48 --> 1183.919
eventually is only

1178.52 --> 1186.679
there for them to convince

1183.919 --> 1189.88
themselves that they got everybody by

1186.679 --> 1191.3200000000002
the balls and under control you see even

1189.88 --> 1195.6000000000001
when it's not

1191.32 --> 1199.4399999999998
working so yeah again my weird little

1195.6 --> 1202.799
saying they it ends up into gaslighting

1199.44 --> 1204.64
themselves it should seem very familiar

1202.799 --> 1208.039
right overall

1204.64 --> 1208.039
Behavior with the

1211.919 --> 1219.039
seat so what was originally meant as a

1215.919 --> 1223.0800000000002
managing and manipulation system for The

1219.039 --> 1226.24
Wider public as as it's all slipping

1223.08 --> 1229.24
away out of their

1226.24 --> 1233.039
control they Double Down more and

1229.24 --> 1235.1200000000001
more but the entire function of it all

1233.039 --> 1238.24
basically switches because it's not

1235.12 --> 1240.52
fooling people anymore but it is fooling

1238.24 --> 1245.76
them

1240.52 --> 1245.76
themselves into that they still have

1253.0 --> 1260.12
control it's like they just become very

1256.799 --> 1260.12
impressed by themselves

1264.4 --> 1273.76
and that distracts them away from how

1268.88 --> 1273.7600000000002
little their manipulation is actually

1274.039 --> 1277.039
working

1281.6 --> 1289.6399999999999
see clear sign of Beginning of the

1284.84 --> 1293.3999999999999
End cuz once that happens you can't read

1289.64 --> 1296.1200000000001
really continue on it's only going to

1293.4 --> 1299.3600000000001
get worse and it's literally like yeah

1296.12 --> 1302.799
it just becomes so dysfunctional that

1299.36 --> 1302.799
they can't achieve anything

1304.6 --> 1312.8799999999999
anymore the cohesion will just

1309.32 --> 1315.2
unravel and all the the mafia families

1312.88 --> 1318.44
and their power and what they do will

1315.2 --> 1322.2
kind of just like stop pretending ending

1318.44 --> 1323.76
to be other things and just

1322.2 --> 1327.0800000000002
like

1323.76 --> 1327.08
be more

1328.159 --> 1333.0
straightforward I mean there's chances

1330.159 --> 1335.8400000000001
it will be that like Mafia wars type

1333.0 --> 1335.84
things might

1338.08 --> 1344.039
breakout which is also well part of the

1341.24 --> 1346.4
entire Middle East

1344.039 --> 1350.48
situation it's just all these freaking

1346.4 --> 1350.48
mafia families trying to duke it

1676.039 --> 1680.8799999999999
slavery how the hell hell would that

1678.32 --> 1683.12
apply to Scotland it's the most [Â __Â ]

1680.88 --> 1683.1200000000001
thing

1687.559 --> 1693.9189999999999
ever like Scottish people didn't really

1692.6 --> 1696.4399999999998
have

1693.919 --> 1700.8400000000001
slaves they

1696.44 --> 1702.76
were used as slaves like they or they

1700.84 --> 1706.4399999999998
had to fight it off all the

1702.76 --> 1708.2
time like it's so

1706.44 --> 1710.799
ridiculous

1708.2 --> 1712.8400000000001

1710.799 --> 1715.039
what the [Â __Â ] are you doing here like

1712.84 --> 1717.799
it's none of your damn business it's

1715.039 --> 1720.0
like you're a delusional [Â __Â ] you

1717.799 --> 1723.2
don't belong

1720.0 --> 1728.6
there they should literally catapult him

1723.2 --> 1728.6000000000001
out of the country like with a a giant

1730.84 --> 1735.1589999999999
catapult and maybe give him a

1736.399 --> 1739.399
parachute

1746.88 --> 1751.96
name a country that made Scots slaves or

1749.76 --> 1751.96
they

1754.159 --> 1759.44
tried I never said they actually

1756.519 --> 1761.47
succeeded low fruit but I mean they

1759.44 --> 1764.579
would succeed with

1761.47 --> 1764.579
[Music]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
individuals

1770.64 --> 1775.3600000000001
it's because it's so hard that they

1773.0 --> 1778.36
really wanted it it's like the harder it

1775.36 --> 1781.519
is the get a slave of a certain type of

1778.36 --> 1784.12
people the more badass you look when you

1781.519 --> 1786.96
actually have a slave of that kind of

1784.12 --> 1789.799
people that's how those [Â __Â ] nobility

1786.96 --> 1789.799
of those times

1796.32 --> 1799.32
think

1800.44 --> 1806.24
the Romans gave up trying and build a

1803.76 --> 1806.24
wall

1811.039 --> 1816.279
yeah but the point is is that they

1813.64 --> 1816.279
definitely

1823.76 --> 1829.919
tried I mean what I'm really expecting

1826.88 --> 1832.48
and I'm really really high high

1829.919 --> 1835.64
expectation from freaking

1832.48 --> 1838.919
Scotland is that they would actually

1835.64 --> 1838.919
completely break

1839.0 --> 1846.12
face and maybe actually have well a

1843.279 --> 1847.159
racist Revolution and literally kick

1846.12 --> 1851.32
these

1847.159 --> 1854.44
disgusting foreign sjw Marxist infield

1851.32 --> 1856.6
trador poit like literally like kidnpped

1854.44 --> 1857.76
them and like dump them outside of the

1856.6 --> 1860.039

1857.76 --> 1866.72
like never come back or we [Â __Â ] kill

1860.039 --> 1866.72
you like I really of any country in like

1866.76 --> 1873.76
Scotland but it seems like no we gladly

1870.76 --> 1878.039
have become complete cocked [Â __Â ] that

1873.76 --> 1883.6
would be gladly euthanized out of

1878.039 --> 1883.6
existence that's so yeah that's it

1886.159 --> 1889.159
then

1889.93 --> 1894.439
[Music]

1907.08 --> 1912.12
I think maybe it's just the general

1913.6 --> 1920.639
Scottish what do you call that that

1917.2 --> 1922.919
Scottish attitude has been leaned upon

1920.639 --> 1925.559
for so long by the

1922.919 --> 1929.48
Scots like the reputation of their

1925.559 --> 1932.36
ancestors has been held on so so

1929.48 --> 1934.76
long that they've actually all become

1932.36 --> 1937.12
completely the opposite and totally

1934.76 --> 1939.48
weakened everybody expects Scots to be

1937.12 --> 1942.1589999999999
strong when they're all completely

1939.48 --> 1945.559
sniveling babyish

cowards really they all have like

1945.559 --> 1950.559
courage issues

1948.48 --> 1953.559
because everybody expects them to be the

1950.559 --> 1955.9189999999999
Scots from hundreds of years ago and

1953.559 --> 1955.9189999999999
they're

1958.519 --> 1965.279
not their ancestors literally that they

1962.24 --> 1969.08
were badasses is making it really hard

1965.279 --> 1970.919
on them because they've all weakened and

1969.08 --> 1975.1999999999998
bit down on

1975.2 --> 1980.0800000000002
fearful yet but they are the Scots so

1978.639 --> 1982.639
everybody's like yeah but they're

1980.08 --> 1986.1999999999998
badasses right no they're not they're

1982.639 --> 1986.1999999999998
completely collapsing

1991.399 --> 1998.12
[Â __Â ] they're not just not doing

1995.76 --> 2001.96
it so

1998.12 --> 2004.4399999999998
yeah enjoy getting euthanized cuz that's

2001.96 --> 2008.96
what is happening and will happen and

2004.44 --> 2008.96
will continue to happen yeah

2009.0 --> 2015.72
yeah it's not as dramatic as getting

2012.2 --> 2015.72
bombed by some

2017.84 --> 2024.08

2020.84 --> 2027.399

whole Ira stuff right in Northern

2258.88 --> 2265.0
like sexual inuendo especially on this

2371.92 --> 2377.319
seems like like Ireland is turning out

2375.28 --> 2379.1600000000003
to have way more

character than

Scotland

2382.0 --> 2387.359
overall and that Scotland like almost

2385.2 --> 2389.96
doesn't deserve to actually be called

2695.079 --> 2701.319
badass and with the ships and yeah yeah

2697.48 --> 2704.64
I'm not pretending like it's actually

2701.319 --> 2704.64
still anything

2705.4 --> 2711.7200000000003
okay we are like a deep

2708.839 --> 2715.16
State satellite

2711.72 --> 2715.16
country at this

2720.079 --> 2726.76
point I mean half the freaking people

2723.319 --> 2730.359
you face here are from another country

2726.76 --> 2733.48
I'm not even joking it's so it's like

2730.359 --> 2733.48
it's a gigantic

2733.92 --> 2739.8
mess and I don't think that anything can

2737.04 --> 2741.88
fix it anymore maybe maybe some of the

2739.8 --> 2744.76
fian

2741.88 --> 2747.4
people may yeah some of the more outer

2744.76 --> 2749.3190000000004
provinces that aren't so

2747.4 --> 2752.1600000000003
cified [Â __Â ]

2749.319 --> 2755.04
ified they may still

2752.16 --> 2759.0789999999997
like get something together but I mean

2755.04 --> 2759.079
it's all so terrible

2766.37 --> 2769.58
[Music]

2771.0 --> 2776.88
here Sweden is even

2774.119 --> 2779.92
worse well the weird thing is it's it's

2776.88 --> 2782.359
not like we're overrun by

2779.92 --> 2785.04
migrants like that in the Netherlands

2782.359 --> 2788.2
they have sort of held that off a bit

2785.04 --> 2790.4
more than other countries that's Sur us

2788.2 --> 2794.3999999999996
but we are like this [Â __Â ]

2790.4 --> 2796.92
international corporation [Â __Â ] where

2794.4 --> 2797.96
like oh you're from another country you

2796.92 --> 2800.04
got the

2797.96 --> 2803.52
job

2800.04 --> 2806.599
immediately like like and so like half

2803.52 --> 2808.559
the freaking people that work around

2806.599 --> 2809.8
here sometimes you have to check if

2808.559 --> 2813.8
they're even

2809.8 --> 2816.4
Dutch it used to be worse

2813.8 --> 2818.92
actually but they were so

2816.4 --> 2821.64
internationalized that I would like like

2818.92 --> 2821.64
I don't even

2822.559 --> 2829.44
recognize the people like I don't get

2826.76 --> 2831.76
it what the hell does any of this have

2829.44 --> 2835.319
to do with the Netherlands and it was so

2831.76 --> 2839.5200000000004
it's been such a scoffing and disrespect

2835.319 --> 2839.52
at everything Dutch for such a long

2839.8 --> 2843.6800000000003
time like 20 years

2844.44 --> 2849.68
straight the Marxism has like leaked in

2847.52 --> 2851.7599999999998
here like everything that like happened

2849.68 --> 2854.96
in the United States like the

2851.76 --> 2858.0400000000004
Netherlands would like really like a a

2854.96 --> 2860.359
good little slave follow suit with

2858.04 --> 2863.04
everything including the Marxist

2860.359 --> 2863.04
Revolution

2873.04 --> 2878.0
[Â __Â ] there should have been like a civil

2875.52 --> 2881.28
war I mean when there's when governments

2878.0 --> 2883.72
are rolling out Marxist [Â __Â ] the only

2881.28 --> 2886.119
sensible explanation is an immediate

2883.72 --> 2886.1189999999997
Civil

2888.319 --> 2894.599
War to like get them out immediately at

2892.28 --> 2894.599
all

2897.359 --> 2904.44
cost but I mean yeah it's not really

2900.88 --> 2907.319
happening isn't it not

2904.44 --> 2908.559
anymore we just got our own supposed

2907.319 --> 2910.96
trump-like

2908.559 --> 2913.0
politician who's much better by the way

2910.96 --> 2917.359
than Trump

2913.0 --> 2917.359
well less compromised I

2918.079 --> 2926.119
think but I mean it's all just a stupid

2921.359 --> 2928.359
game like yay we are completely

2926.119 --> 2930.799
discriminatory like this person can be

2928.359 --> 2934.5589999999997
treated like complete

2930.799 --> 2936.2
[Â __Â ] like have lies being published

2934.559 --> 2939.4
about him

2936.2 --> 2941.1189999999997
that are provably lies and and like

2939.4 --> 2944.1600000000003
they're not even

2941.119 --> 2947.2000000000003
retracting it's

2944.16 --> 2951.48
like the country my country has been so

2947.2 --> 2956.0
severely compromised like I don't see

2951.48 --> 2958.559
any I don't see it recovering like

2956.0 --> 2961.2
ever cuz even if there was some kind of

2958.559 --> 2964.079
Civil War like the actual Dutch people

2961.2 --> 2964.0789999999997
would literally be

2964.52 --> 2967.52
outnumbered

2968.119 --> 2972.1600000000003
Dutch people that would be willing to do

2969.88 --> 2974.599
that which is the

2972.16 --> 2979.5989999999997
minority because the rest all [Â __Â ]

2974.599 --> 2979.599
cocked and gay and like just

2983.599 --> 2989.28
dying I've had an idea for a while and

2986.64 --> 2991.48
that is like cocking and people that are

2989.28 --> 2994.52
like that should like be publicly

2991.48 --> 2997.52
punished and shamed like pretty

2994.52 --> 2997.52
harshly

2998.119 --> 3002.52
it's like not just enough to be like H

3000.52 --> 3005.839
yeah we don't like people that no it has

3002.52 --> 3009.28
to like actually you're [Â __Â ] evil

3005.839 --> 3011.0
you're a problem to the nation you and

3009.28 --> 3015.6400000000003
your

3011.0 --> 3015.64
weakness is a detriment to our

3016.319 --> 3022.319
nation and you should be punished for

3018.839 --> 3024.839
that behavior like you must correct you

3022.319 --> 3029.799
must stop cocking or you will be

3024.839 --> 3033.52
punished for cocking yeah that that's

3029.799 --> 3034.78
something that's on my heart for like

3033.52 --> 3036.16
two

3034.78 --> 3038.559
[Music]

3036.16 --> 3040.68
decades but it's not there I mean

3038.559 --> 3043.6800000000003
cocking is fully

3040.68 --> 3043.68
systemic

3044.04 --> 3047.319
here it's

3050.119 --> 3055.6400000000003
industrialized so I'm

3052.599 --> 3057.04
not I'm actually what I said to this the

3055.64 --> 3059.7599999999998
Scots is

3057.04 --> 3063.0
because I guess I have more hope for

3059.76 --> 3067.76
them than I even have for my own people

3063.0 --> 3072.599
here although that might simply be all

3067.76 --> 3076.88
false maybe the Scots really are much

3072.599 --> 3079.44
worse they're just really badass at

3076.88 --> 3082.76
making people shut up so that they don't

3079.44 --> 3085.44
get reminded how absolutely [Â __Â ] they

3082.76 --> 3088.119
all are because of their own stupid

3085.44 --> 3090.7200000000003
stupidity and weak

3088.119 --> 3093.88
willness they're really good at beating

3090.72 --> 3097.3599999999997
your face up if you remind them about

3093.88 --> 3102.359
how [Â __Â ] insanely cowardly you

3097.36 --> 3105.52
[Music]

3102.359 --> 3107.799
are right you're I bet you're good at

3105.52 --> 3110.839
that well that shit's not happening

3107.799 --> 3114.359
we're actually cucked here like people

3110.839 --> 3115.88
are like oh don't be

3114.359 --> 3119.319
mean

3115.88 --> 3122.4
or like oh but that's but that means

3119.319 --> 3125.2
you're a racist or you're

3122.4 --> 3127.4700000000003
bad because you're not following along

3125.2 --> 3130.6499999999996
with this with the Marxist

3127.47 --> 3130.6499999999996
[Music]

3130.72 --> 3137.3999999999996
narrative like people are scared of

3134.88 --> 3139.079
people that resist the Marxist narrative

3137.4 --> 3141.1600000000003
like there are

3139.079 --> 3144.28
literally

3141.16 --> 3147.2799999999997
scared of

3144.28 --> 3147.28
them

3147.799 --> 3154.28
yeah we need

3150.559 --> 3158.4
liberals it's a widespread mental

3154.28 --> 3160.48
disease here and they are

3158.4 --> 3163.2000000000003
scared of

3160.48 --> 3166.319
people that don't

3163.2 --> 3168.839
follow the Marxist narrative and way to

3166.319 --> 3171.68
do things they're scared of

3168.839 --> 3176.4
them it's that

3171.68 --> 3179.52
bad so yeah I hope that

3176.4 --> 3179.52
helps explain

3180.04 --> 3185.2
things yeah I'm not saying oh we

3183.04 --> 3187.48
dutchies we're so much better than you

3185.2 --> 3189.5989999999997
Scots why are you letting this have no

3187.48 --> 3192.44
I'm just saying

3189.599 --> 3194.44
like just please freaking do something

3192.44 --> 3197.2000000000003
about it be before you become as

3194.44 --> 3197.2000000000003
terrible as the

3203.24 --> 3208.1189999999997
Netherlands and I mean yeah the the

3205.44 --> 3210.2400000000002
Dutch people are probably very nice when

3208.119 --> 3212.96
you come and visit and they're very nice

3210.24 --> 3216.04
to you I know yeah that's really cool

3212.96 --> 3219.28
right if you look more deeply at what's

3216.04 --> 3221.7599999999998
behind the the the nice attitude to the

3219.28 --> 3223.079
stranger you'll find out that our

3221.76 --> 3227.5200000000004
country

3223.079 --> 3231.6800000000003
is suffering severely from anti-white

3227.52 --> 3234.319
racist persecution and anti-nationalist

3231.68 --> 3237.16
sentiment that's like not just on the

3234.319 --> 3237.16
surface

3241.68 --> 3247.0
like we're being invaded continually by

3244.44 --> 3247.0
Foreign

3247.16 --> 3252.8799999999997
corporations and just giant punishing

3251.119 --> 3256.599
rules on any

3252.88 --> 3259.119
actual National Corporation or people

3259.119 --> 3266.0
locals they [Â __Â ] them up

3263.359 --> 3268.5589999999997
it's it's Absolut abolutely bizarre it

3266.0 --> 3270.68
needs to be turned around dramatically

3268.559 --> 3273.2400000000002
and there needs to be things put in

3270.68 --> 3275.72
place to ensure that that can never

3273.24 --> 3275.72
happen

3383.92 --> 3386.92
yesterday

the Netherlands sold it so to the gra

3389.44 --> 3396.359
globalist the

3392.24 --> 3399.4399999999996
grabs yeah well the Netherlands is like

3396.359 --> 3401.96
these snubs here they Pride themselves

3399.44 --> 3404.559
of like creating it they think they

3401.96 --> 3404.559
invented

3411.76 --> 3418.6800000000003
globalism but I mean these globalists

3414.319 --> 3418.68
are par sites to the Netherlands it's

3418.72 --> 3424.68
like they

3420.72 --> 3427.56
just globalists as as they they have

3424.68 --> 3430.68
absolutely no respect for

3470.44 --> 3475.68
does I

3472.44 --> 3478.799
have a theory though that that I

3475.68 --> 3481.04
think is the more popular and that's I

3478.799 --> 3484.099
don't

3481.04 --> 3484.099

3519.44 --> 3523.2400000000002
okay gaining wisdom thank you for

3523.559 --> 3530.599
that yeah I mean I was like I didn't

3527.119 --> 3533.599
care about him when he was alive in

3530.599 --> 3535.6800000000003
stupid series and I certainly don't care

3533.599 --> 3538.1600000000003
about him now that he's dead

3535.68 --> 3540.96
it's like good now you can go to that

3538.16 --> 3542.72
place on the other side that nobody

3540.96 --> 3545.92
cares about where you

3542.72 --> 3548.5589999999997
belong not Hell or Heaven it's just some

3545.92 --> 3551.119
place that nobody cares about because

3548.559 --> 3554.6400000000003
that's how I felt about you in life and

3551.119 --> 3557.92
that's how we going to feel about you in

3607.359 --> 3611.24
right anyway I hope everybody's enjoying

3609.2 --> 3614.72
themselves this

3611.24 --> 3617.24
Monday there will be live

3614.72 --> 3620.16
fed in 45

3617.24 --> 3622.68
minutes Nathan says he's got everything

3620.16 --> 3622.68
working

3623.559 --> 3627.3190000000004
again

3625.119 --> 3631.839
or at least he thinks so so it might be

3627.319 --> 3634.119
some weird glitching stuff again I mean

3631.839 --> 3637.44
he's Bas Nathan's had to basically

3634.119 --> 3640.599
reinstall everything from

3637.44 --> 3644.44
scratch I don't know

3640.599 --> 3648.839
why seems really stupid but I mean he's

3644.44 --> 3651.599
done that it's huge amount of

3648.839 --> 3653.52
time and he's not going to be there by a

3651.599 --> 3655.119
long shot

3653.52 --> 3657.319
but

3655.119 --> 3659.4
because you can only really all work it

3657.319 --> 3662.68
out by actually running it and then

3659.4 --> 3662.6800000000003
figuring out how it goes

3665.599 --> 3673.1600000000003
wrong anyway saying gaining wisdom that

3670.0 --> 3676.96
Jo not true

3673.16 --> 3676.96
what is he saying

3677.799 --> 3682.44
that oh because he said y'

3683.44 --> 3686.44
way

3698.319 --> 3705.599
yeah I don't trust any of

3702.119 --> 3710.52
that and I've suspected that like Old

3705.599 --> 3713.119
Testament God that did those things was

3710.52 --> 3716.44
seemed much more like what the devil

3713.119 --> 3716.44
would do

3720.96 --> 3726.2400000000002
and in that sense I do think that Jesus

3723.92 --> 3731.88
when he did

3726.24 --> 3731.8799999999997
come actually like opened the gateway

3732.079 --> 3737.079
to well the actual

3738.92 --> 3743.16
God you like cleared the

3743.359 --> 3749.5589999999997
roots

3745.559 --> 3749.559
cleared the way that's how I see

3769.46 --> 3776.359
[Music]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
it

3779.64 --> 3785.16
right but you also have to take into

3782.599 --> 3788.44
account this is often overlooked that

3785.16 --> 3794.0789999999997
back then ancient

3788.44 --> 3797.319
times we did there was no like modern

3794.079 --> 3800.3590000000004
standards it really wasn't so like there

3797.319 --> 3802.52
was no civilization standards really

3800.359 --> 3805.48
there were peoples that were so

3802.52 --> 3808.88
unbelievably Savage

3805.48 --> 3811.559
that genocide was really kind of common

3808.88 --> 3814.44
place and when you live in a world where

3811.559 --> 3817.079
like genocide is like happening all the

3814.44 --> 3821.0
time and like entire peoples just get

3817.079 --> 3822.6800000000003
erased all of a sudden and like all the

3821.0 --> 3826.24
information all the history and

3822.68 --> 3826.24
everything and

3826.319 --> 3834.319
that's what if when you think about that

3830.319 --> 3836.48
then a radical God that would literally

3834.319 --> 3838.839
basically so you're like yeah if they do

3836.48 --> 3841.64
this it's okay to genocide them well

3838.839 --> 3844.24
that wouldn't even be that weird that

3841.64 --> 3848.64
wouldn't even be that evil in the face

3844.24 --> 3850.7599999999998
of such atrocities around you you

3848.64 --> 3855.0389999999998
see

3850.76 --> 3857.48
but if that would enter the world here

3855.039 --> 3859.8390000000004
as it is now everything yeah of course

3857.48 --> 3862.92
that would seem like totally

3859.839 --> 3866.52
evil and it is totally

3862.92 --> 3869.96
evil if that Spirit were to

3866.52 --> 3873.359
not undergo all the developments over

3869.96 --> 3877.88
the centuries and the Millennia and go

3873.359 --> 3877.88
directly here yeah pure

3890.44 --> 3895.599
Carnage so yeah it's it's a matter of

3893.44 --> 3899.559
perspective you know know was the god

3895.599 --> 3903.3590000000004
from the Old Testament was he the

3899.559 --> 3908.039
devil still ruling the Earth or was it

3903.359 --> 3911.0389999999998
rather was it really God but in another

3908.039 --> 3915.119
directive because it was the god that

3911.039 --> 3915.119
had to clean up the [Â __Â ]

3915.359 --> 3918.359
first

3920.359 --> 3928.119
see and that means the same God but

3924.599 --> 3930.96
literally with a different

3928.119 --> 3935.48
directive because there's so much crap

3930.96 --> 3935.48
everywhere and like random

3935.53 --> 3943.46
[Music]

3945.68 --> 3951.96
genocides the serpent seed

3948.96 --> 3951.96
Theory

3953.079 --> 3956.079
me

3956.839 --> 3960.4
I think that's all Catholic

3961.039 --> 3967.3190000000004
nonsense anything that goes about

3963.559 --> 3967.3190000000004
serpent seed and all

3969.039 --> 3975.6400000000003
that and like original sin is all a

3973.16 --> 3979.5989999999997
bunch of Catholic hor

3975.64 --> 3980.89
[Â __Â ] it's all theocracy spiritual scams

3979.599 --> 3983.0
to control

3980.89 --> 3986.0
[Music]

3983.0 --> 3986.0
you

3990.04 --> 3994.449
[Music]

4003.0 --> 4009.559
very Gnostic F that the Old Testament

4006.0 --> 4012.559
God is the Dei

4009.559 --> 4012.559
urge

4013.0 --> 4016.0
okay

4017.319 --> 4020.24
gnostics

4023.52 --> 4029.279
Catholics I'm not talking about what

4026.2 --> 4032.7599999999998
people in current day believe clutch

4029.279 --> 4032.76
that's not what I was

4042.92 --> 4048.359
referencing most Christians against

4045.92 --> 4050.92
serpent seed

4048.359 --> 4054.5589999999997
Theory so you're saying that serpent

4050.92 --> 4056.92
seed theory is nostic but gnosticism is

4054.559 --> 4056.92
not

4061.4 --> 4067.64
Christian I don't get

4064.279 --> 4069.4
it so what the who the [Â __Â ] care like

4067.64 --> 4072.92
why the hell would Christians care what

4069.4 --> 4075.119
gnostics have to say about

4072.92 --> 4077.06
their

4075.119 --> 4084.719
religion I don't get

4077.06 --> 4084.719
[Music]

4093.039 --> 4098.4800000000005
it couldn in the eyes tell me that you

4095.599 --> 4098.4800000000005
believe original

4100.279 --> 4104.759
sin original sin is

4102.839 --> 4108.2789999999995
[Â __Â ]

4104.759 --> 4113.12
and so is Heaven and Hell in after

4108.279 --> 4115.92
death like that and oh you oh yes oh

4113.12 --> 4117.799
don't you believe you have to chant

4115.92 --> 4122.12
these [Â __Â ]

4117.799 --> 4123.96
words before they die or they go to

4122.12 --> 4128.3189999999995
Eternal

4123.96 --> 4131.56
torture you really believe that or you

4128.319 --> 4134.400000000001
really think that's a Theocratic mind

4131.56 --> 4137.319
control scam

4134.4 --> 4137.3189999999995
cuz that's what I

4141.88 --> 4150.899
[Music]

4151.239 --> 4155.2789999999995
think it's sewing

4156.96 --> 4162.52
Superstition it's literally like say

4159.239 --> 4164.879999999999
these magic words or you get Eternal

4162.52 --> 4167.88
torture I mean

4164.88 --> 4167.88
me

4175.12 --> 4183.839
it if you'd if you'd had to think up the

4180.679 --> 4186.56
the devil's

4183.839 --> 4188.799
religion well that would be

4186.56 --> 4192.96
it

4188.799 --> 4195.679
exactly it's like the ultimate unaware

4192.96 --> 4200.6
hypocrisy

4195.679 --> 4200.6
system it's crazy everything about it is

4203.679 --> 4210.04
crazy and I I'd love to see

4207.04 --> 4213.92
like experiments with this psychological

4210.04 --> 4216.6
experiments of with Christianity of like

4213.92 --> 4221.12
what if you let a kid actually

4216.6 --> 4224.280000000001
read like the parts of the Bible with

4221.12 --> 4226.719
Jesus specifically that not Old

4224.28 --> 4228.639999999999
Testament stuff not like oh it's really

4226.719 --> 4230.8
important that you know the correlation

4228.64 --> 4233.8
between these Prophet blah blah no just

4230.8 --> 4236.52
the actions

4233.8 --> 4238.2390000000005
Jesus how he thinks and all that right

4236.52 --> 4241.2390000000005
like so they get to know

4238.239 --> 4243.159
Jesus and then really like talk with

4241.239 --> 4245.919999999999
them with about it like they really get

4243.159 --> 4247.679
it like yeah you're a disciple of Jesus

4245.92 --> 4250.6
you understand them you follow his

4247.679 --> 4255.04
teachings you recognize the wisdom and

4250.6 --> 4257.2390000000005
the benefit of following that wisdom

4255.04 --> 4259.64
and then you expose them to like the

4257.239 --> 4259.639999999999
church

4261.52 --> 4266.88
Community how long is it going to take

4263.92 --> 4269.56
before they find out like this is

4266.88 --> 4272.8
actually the

4269.56 --> 4278.080000000001
devil it is the Antichrist the church is

4272.8 --> 4281.159000000001
the Antichrist pretending to be

4278.08 --> 4284.28
Christ it's

4281.159 --> 4287.159
everything that that comes out of it is

4284.28 --> 4289.4
doing the opposite of what they should

4287.159 --> 4289.4
be

4297.12 --> 4301.92
doing and you know what the funny thing

4299.6 --> 4305.1990000000005
is actually in a way is that my parents

4301.92 --> 4308.4400000000005
did that with me what I just

4305.199 --> 4310.678999999999
described they taught me about Jesus

4308.44 --> 4313.12
specifically not like about the Bible

4310.679 --> 4315.4
and you must believe in this and that or

4313.12 --> 4318.04
they were just they were

4315.4 --> 4320.0
not they didn't believe it really they

4318.04 --> 4323.5199999999995
didn't believe like heaven or hell they

4320.0 --> 4325.639
had ideas and dreams and but they didn't

4323.52 --> 4327.56
really believe it they would talk about

4325.639 --> 4329.92
it but they wouldn't be like oh this is

4327.56 --> 4331.96
really important or anything and it

4329.92 --> 4335.84
would just like yeah just look at this

4331.96 --> 4338.0
man and amazing things that he's said

4335.84 --> 4340.92
especially what he said not the like the

4338.0 --> 4343.88
the Miracles because we my parents

4340.92 --> 4346.36
didn't necessarily believe that it it's

4343.88 --> 4348.32
just that let just listen to the words

4346.36 --> 4352.28
listen to what he actually says and then

4348.32 --> 4355.679
think about it and realize the power of

4352.28 --> 4358.199
it I had that as a

4355.679 --> 4362.4
kid not the

4358.199 --> 4365.48
Bible not all go to church or Sunday

4362.4 --> 4370.4
school but they just taught me about

4365.48 --> 4370.4
Jesus from I guess a non-Christian

4371.8 --> 4375.88
perspective just for the wisd wisdom of

4376.199 --> 4383.799999999999
it and then I did actually like go out

4380.44 --> 4386.4
and like try to con yeah meet Christians

4383.8 --> 4389.0
and go go to churches and just see what

4386.4 --> 4392.28
it's like and then totally realize like

4389.0 --> 4396.04
holy [Â __Â ] everything about this is

4392.28 --> 4398.12
wrong like pain feeling pain of like

4396.04 --> 4399.92
everything is so out of place all these

4398.12 --> 4403.92
people are all thinking they're doing

4399.92 --> 4405.76
something and they're completely off

4403.92 --> 4408.36
and they will feel good it will still

4405.76 --> 4411.2390000000005
work physically they will still go along

4408.36 --> 4414.679
and all that it's just that they're

4411.239 --> 4416.799999999999
completely wrong they just don't

4414.679 --> 4418.52
understand what the hell they're doing

4416.8 --> 4421.12
at all with this spiritual stuff and

4418.52 --> 4423.679
they don't they don't have a grip they

4421.12 --> 4426.159
don't have any grip on Spirit mechanics

4423.679 --> 4428.32
whatsoever on their own sensories they

4426.159 --> 4433.0
barely have

4428.32 --> 4435.36
grip yeah Christians don't study their

4433.0 --> 4435.36
own

4438.08 --> 4443.5599999999995
senses they typically don't do

4441.04 --> 4447.28
that and you

4443.56 --> 4450.679
should like how can you judge spiritual

4447.28 --> 4452.599999999999
matters how can you see the light when

4450.679 --> 4455.1990000000005
you don't train your

4452.6 --> 4457.1990000000005
senses you just let anything happen and

4455.199 --> 4459.879999999999
whatever somebody says and if it feels

4457.199 --> 4462.28
right oh that it's good no you have to

4459.88 --> 4464.8
train your

4462.28 --> 4467.84
senses you have to train your senses to

4464.8 --> 4470.4400000000005
pay attention to things the things that

4467.84 --> 4470.4400000000005
aren't that

4472.159 --> 4477.28
straightforward otherwise how would you

4474.4 --> 4480.159
know the Devil in

4477.28 --> 4483.44
Disguise right I know the Devil in

4480.159 --> 4488.04
Disguise by his methods that's what I

4483.44 --> 4490.12
look at it's like oh Christians oh like

4488.04 --> 4492.76
how

4490.12 --> 4495.4
much how much compromised is this

4492.76 --> 4497.52
Christian person and you can test that

4495.4 --> 4499.92
like where are they compromised where

4497.52 --> 4501.320000000001
will they fall back to like theocracy

4499.92 --> 4504.639
type

4501.32 --> 4507.679
actions or will they like really honor

4504.639 --> 4507.679
the good and

4507.84 --> 4512.8
like be good with their ego surrendering

4511.44 --> 4515.919999999999
to the

4512.8 --> 4518.4400000000005
moment like you can test all these

4515.92 --> 4518.4400000000005
things with

4522.199 --> 4527.96
Christians

4524.679 --> 4529.4800000000005
but in my overall life experience

4527.96 --> 4531.4
especially when I was younger it's

4529.48 --> 4535.5199999999995
really

4531.4 --> 4538.199
like church goers they just go because

4535.52 --> 4539.4800000000005
they're lonely and they want some social

4538.199 --> 4543.159
contact

4539.48 --> 4545.839999999999
and and feel good about

4543.159 --> 4548.5199999999995
themselves but the real Christians

4545.84 --> 4552.0
they're not super Church

4548.52 --> 4554.92
going they're like in the

4552.0 --> 4557.199
world and they're like really making

4554.92 --> 4559.78
effort to hold things together and to

4557.199 --> 4562.36
have a plan and to be

4559.78 --> 4565.5199999999995
[Music]

4562.36 --> 4568.719
prepared yeah I know Jason I know you're

4565.52 --> 4571.6
lonely I mean it's got to be very lonely

4568.719 --> 4574.679
when you believe in something that is

4571.6 --> 4579.400000000001
utterly repugnantly ridiculous and

4574.679 --> 4582.639
without proof yeah so you Church going

4579.4 --> 4584.879999999999
don't do not I'm not surprised at all

4582.639 --> 4586.56
because it's very isolating when you

4584.88 --> 4589.0
believe in something that is that

4586.56 --> 4589.0
freaking

4589.159 --> 4594.08
stupid I would go to church too if I

4591.92 --> 4598.12
believe what you

4594.08 --> 4601.08
believe just to try to deal with that

4598.12 --> 4602.599999999999
belief it's like yeah I'm [Â __Â ] I I

4601.08 --> 4605.08
need to go to church because I'm

4602.6 --> 4607.159000000001
[Â __Â ] I can't stop being [Â __Â ] I

4605.08 --> 4610.44
need to go to church hopefully God will

4607.159 --> 4610.44
save me

4610.48 --> 4614.32
[Music]

4612.08 --> 4617.28
yeah

4614.32 --> 4617.28
I do that too

4618.89 --> 4622.81
[Music]

4630.21 --> 4638.0
[Music]

4634.32 --> 4641.799999999999
Jason oh Lord Jesus yeah yeah I can of

4638.0 --> 4641.8
bear I'm not a big fan of that sort of

4642.0 --> 4645.0
thing

4645.719 --> 4651.92
the baby Jesus yeah it's very annoying

4648.239 --> 4656.759999999999
to me I mean I like Jesus to be

4651.92 --> 4660.76
addressed as a worthy powerful creature

4656.76 --> 4662.96
which is what he is incredibly

4660.76 --> 4666.159000000001
powerful

4662.96 --> 4667.36
lasting I mean he I'm pretty convinced

4666.159 --> 4670.36
that

4667.36 --> 4674.44
Jesus what he did is like the Christ

4670.36 --> 4678.12
spirit that we actually deal with

4674.44 --> 4681.199
right the Holy Spirit I think that the

4678.12 --> 4685.36
holy spirit is Jesus

4681.199 --> 4687.879999999999
Christ then he created that he made that

4685.36 --> 4690.839999999999
deal with God to be like on the other

4687.88 --> 4696.28
side and make that

4690.84 --> 4699.679
available for a thousand years or

4696.28 --> 4699.679
forever I don't

4701.28 --> 4706.8
know I think that Jesus is just is in

4704.88 --> 4709.1990000000005
the other dimension he's in the Dark

4706.8 --> 4712.04
World on the other side and he always

4709.199 --> 4712.04
was

4713.48 --> 4716.879999999999
like or at

4717.679 --> 4723.36
least after he

4720.719 --> 4725.12
lived I don't know what was there before

4723.36 --> 4726.679
I can't imagine a world where there

4725.12 --> 4729.199
isn't

4726.679 --> 4732.6
some Christ

4729.199 --> 4733.719
Spirit some holy ghost that you can just

4732.6 --> 4736.92
like

4733.719 --> 4739.719
in yourself have contact with I

4736.92 --> 4742.12
mean I can't imagine that there would

4739.719 --> 4744.84
that it wouldn't be

4742.12 --> 4746.84
there so I wonder

4744.84 --> 4751.6
sometimes is

4746.84 --> 4754.52
it there because of Christ or was it

4751.6 --> 4759.4800000000005
always there and he simply had the

4754.52 --> 4759.4800000000005
senses to stumble upon it recognize

4760.239 --> 4766.718999999999
it and then share about it

4764.32 --> 4766.719
I'm not

4768.57 --> 4771.79
[Music]

4773.76 --> 4778.2390000000005
sure call no man father that's

4778.28 --> 4786.5599999999995
right yeah and

4781.88 --> 4788.52
that right that a building is not a that

4786.56 --> 4789.360000000001
the church is not a building that is

4788.52 --> 4793.8
like

4789.36 --> 4795.96
where two or three of us meet

4793.8 --> 4798.360000000001
that is where I am that's where the

4795.96 --> 4798.36
church

4798.44 --> 4803.28
is something like that I'm paraphrasing

4801.12 --> 4807.679
terribly I'm sorry

4803.28 --> 4809.639
guys so my Christ quotations is not

4807.679 --> 4814.76
actually is not really

4809.639 --> 4814.76
topnotch like verbally I'm sorry about

4814.84 --> 4822.52
that but the point is that so many

4817.639 --> 4824.12
things that Jesus so clearly said are

4822.52 --> 4828.159000000001
being being

4824.12 --> 4831.48
directly contradicted by all forms of

4828.159 --> 4834.32
established Christianity all churches

4831.48 --> 4837.32
and starting with the Catholics Catholic

4834.32 --> 4839.719
was the most blatantly in opposition to

4837.32 --> 4843.199
Everything Jesus

4839.719 --> 4847.36
taught they created that they created

4843.199 --> 4851.719
that sense that no you can be a follower

4847.36 --> 4853.239
of Jesus without literally doing what he

4851.719 --> 4856.6
said

4853.239 --> 4859.44
yeah that's thank you Catholicism thank

4856.6 --> 4862.84
you Council of NAA for giving us the

4859.44 --> 4865.159
Antichrist version of Christianity that

4862.84 --> 4867.76
everybody's built upon like all

4865.159 --> 4870.239
Christianity is based upon that

4867.76 --> 4873.2390000000005
Antichrist version of

4870.239 --> 4873.239
Christianity

4875.52 --> 4882.360000000001
brilliant and I mean every every form of

4879.04 --> 4886.04
it I'd love to see a Christianity that

4882.36 --> 4888.599999999999
that isn't in some way with any form of

4886.04 --> 4891.12
tradition based in the Antichrist

4888.6 --> 4891.120000000001
version of

4892.08 --> 4896.5199999999995
Christianity maybe it's out there maybe

4894.639 --> 4899.639
there are some weird

4896.52 --> 4902.52
Fringe Christian

4899.639 --> 4904.2390000000005
Cults but they probably wouldn't call

4902.52 --> 4906.679
themselves Christian that's the weirdest

4904.239 --> 4906.678999999999
thing about

4907.48 --> 4912.839999999999
it I mean there arguably are and I don't

4910.84 --> 4916.360000000001
literally know this but I wouldn't be

4912.84 --> 4919.28
surprised at all that there are like

4916.36 --> 4923.759999999999
religious organizations or groups or

4919.28 --> 4926.96
Cults like over Asia or whatever and

4923.76 --> 4930.4400000000005
Africa that aren't like even directly

4926.96 --> 4933.8
recognizably Christian but that

4930.44 --> 4936.839999999999
literally just live like that the right

4933.8 --> 4939.360000000001
way it's just yeah they're not really

4936.84 --> 4943.719
Christian because

4939.36 --> 4945.48
Christian is the Antichrist

4943.719 --> 4948.92
this is

4945.48 --> 4950.32
and it's is so weird trying to explain

4948.92 --> 4953.88
this

4950.32 --> 4959.0
because I am not

4953.88 --> 4962.08
anti-christian I really like hold Christ

4959.0 --> 4964.0
high in reverence I I think that Jesus

4962.08 --> 4967.159
is wisdom like I think he was the

4964.0 --> 4971.04
Messiah and he's done unbelievable

4967.159 --> 4973.159
things that are incredibly important and

4971.04 --> 4975.04
then I think that that was literally

4973.159 --> 4979.08
followed up by a

4975.04 --> 4981.719
complete corruption like the devil just

4979.08 --> 4984.88
came encapsulate

4981.719 --> 4987.08
this now let's take everything he said

4984.88 --> 4989.92
like the council's nice like how do we

4987.08 --> 4992.76
take everything he said and then create

4989.92 --> 4996.159
a tradition around it that literally

4992.76 --> 4997.679
convinces people of exactly the opposite

4996.159 --> 5000.44
of what it

4997.679 --> 5004.4800000000005
means and then we teach him that and

5000.44 --> 5004.48
then we call it Christianity

5010.76 --> 5014.76
that's how I feel about

5016.48 --> 5022.0
it and I think there was probably an

5019.44 --> 5026.199
original

5022.0 --> 5029.679
Christianity and it was just killed

5026.199 --> 5034.28
off and what wasn't killed off is very

5029.679 --> 5038.4400000000005
likely has like undergone transformation

5034.28 --> 5042.679
out there and may have been absorbed by

5038.44 --> 5045.759999999999
by the Muslim religion that well then

5042.679 --> 5045.76
had their Prophet

5046.32 --> 5051.04
Muhammad so yeah that's what I I think

5048.84 --> 5055.12
that the actual Christians

5051.04 --> 5058.48
are Muslims but I mean Muslims have

5055.12 --> 5061.36
their own issue now they have their own

5058.48 --> 5062.919999999999
Antichrist version yeah which we know of

5061.36 --> 5065.92
as radical Islam

5062.92 --> 5065.92
that's their

5066.4 --> 5071.48
Antichrist and it's quite literally

5068.84 --> 5074.12
Antichrist like they kill

5071.48 --> 5076.959999999999
Christians so there's the Antichrist

5074.12 --> 5080.08
from Catholicism which is the root of

5076.96 --> 5082.4
all forms of modern Christian religion

5080.08 --> 5084.96
which is the Antichrist religion then

5082.4 --> 5088.799999999999
you have the Muslims which really hold

5084.96 --> 5091.4800000000005
the remnants of original

5088.8 --> 5093.76
Christianity and they have their own

5091.48 --> 5098.678999999999
Antichrist

5093.76 --> 5098.679
manifestation now with the radical

5099.4 --> 5106.159
Islam and so

5103.08 --> 5111.119
yeah that's what it feels to me like

5106.159 --> 5114.239
where we're at oh and did I forget the

5111.119 --> 5117.4
Jews on top of

5114.239 --> 5120.32
that so it's like yeah which of these

5117.4 --> 5120.32
three aren't

5121.28 --> 5124.28
[Â __Â ]

5124.48 --> 5131.04
yeah you tell me which of the three

5128.44 --> 5131.04
aren't

5137.32 --> 5144.4
[Â __Â ] I mean the devil's taken all of

5141.159 --> 5146.08
it it's taken all the religions it's

5144.4 --> 5149.32
taken the

5146.08 --> 5151.679
power within the religions and corrupted

5149.32 --> 5154.04
it I mean there's still people that are

5151.679 --> 5157.119
just able to follow those religions

5154.04 --> 5158.6
without following the power and like do

5157.119 --> 5161.759999999999
their best to live a good life and

5158.6 --> 5162.96
follow God's laws and all that from

5161.76 --> 5165.88
their

5162.96 --> 5167.679
perspective and they will do great they

5165.88 --> 5170.0
will be good people they will be

5167.679 --> 5173.639
productive they will be

5170.0 --> 5173.639
protected actually

5174.88 --> 5180.0
protected right

5177.08 --> 5183.239
[Music]

5180.0 --> 5186.679
but the powers with Within These

5183.239 --> 5186.678999999999
religions there's

5188.0 --> 5193.119
Satan and you can trace the origins you

5190.92 --> 5195.76
can trace the roots you can trace how

5193.119 --> 5195.759999999999
they are

5196.92 --> 5200.069
[Music]

5200.56 --> 5208.8
Satan that's no I don't that's not

5205.639 --> 5211.1990000000005
really a proper joke appropr

5208.8 --> 5214.1990000000005
inappropriate as they would

5211.199 --> 5214.199
say

5217.65 --> 5225.389999999999
[Music]

5229.7 --> 5232.849999999999
[Music]

5238.84 --> 5242.76
right so I'm going to have to figure out

5240.4 --> 5246.119
a title for the show

5242.76 --> 5248.8
but I've been pretty good haven't I I'm

5246.119 --> 5251.96
fluid I literally prayed for this

5248.8 --> 5255.04
yesterday like cuz yesterday I was like

5251.96 --> 5258.56
had a lot of just issues functioning

5255.04 --> 5260.199
like hurt tension hurt it's very

5258.56 --> 5263.360000000001
annoying because it just

5260.199 --> 5266.239
like yeah shuts me down makes me

5263.36 --> 5269.04
incapable of really manifesting

5266.239 --> 5270.678999999999
anything but I really prayed hard on

5269.04 --> 5273.92
that like

5270.679 --> 5276.4
anticipatory prayer

5273.92 --> 5278.84
the technique and everything preparation

5276.4 --> 5281.32
and it worked it worked great I didn't

5278.84 --> 5283.6
have any issues with it today at all

5281.32 --> 5283.599999999999
just

5285.239 --> 5290.48
fantastic and I've been capable of

5287.84 --> 5293.32
explaining the things in accordance to

5290.48 --> 5295.199
my vision to my view on it's not Vision

5293.32 --> 5296.719
It's Not Dark World Vision related

5295.199 --> 5299.5599999999995
everything that I'm figuring out here

5296.719 --> 5304.04
with the religion is not Dark World

5299.56 --> 5304.04
related I want to emphasize that

5304.76 --> 5310.8
I did have one experience in the Dark

5307.76 --> 5314.119000000001
World With Jesus which was pretty

5310.8 --> 5314.119000000001
freaking bizarre and

5317.56 --> 5321.6
amazing but not super

5321.76 --> 5327.2390000000005
relevant it's just that I tried to like

5325.159 --> 5330.638999999999
approach him to

5327.239 --> 5332.32
like like what about this world like how

5330.639 --> 5334.37
everything that you've done is has been

5332.32 --> 5337.5599999999995
turned against you

5334.37 --> 5341.28
[Music]

5337.56 --> 5343.080000000001
and but I think that Jesus the Christ

5341.28 --> 5346.36
Spirit on the other side if that was

5343.08 --> 5349.5199999999995
really him that I got to see is just

5346.36 --> 5353.239
tired of like hundreds of billions of

5349.52 --> 5355.8
people over the ages asking him that

5353.239 --> 5355.799999999999
probably

5357.239 --> 5363.599999999999
continually he wasn't like like o I

5360.52 --> 5366.8
really have an important answer for you

5363.6 --> 5370.56
he wasn't like that at all he was more

5366.8 --> 5370.56
like just leave me

5371.87 --> 5374.96
[Music]

5376.639 --> 5383.159000000001
alone like just do the

5380.32 --> 5386.92
things and leave me

5383.159 --> 5389.5199999999995
alone that was Jesus's response in my

5386.92 --> 5389.52
Dark World

5390.92 --> 5393.92
Vision

5410.0 --> 5417.08
show us on this door where Jesus touched

5413.76 --> 5417.08
you right

5420.84 --> 5423.84
here

5434.92 --> 5441.329
[Music]

5448.28 --> 5453.84
no but seriously where Jesus really

5450.159 --> 5453.839999999999
touched me the most was here

5456.08 --> 5462.0
because I believe in like

5458.639 --> 5464.4400000000005
serious it's not just the goodness of it

5462.0 --> 5468.719
it's the wisdom and

5464.44 --> 5472.32
the the logic of what he

5468.719 --> 5475.6
does that's like the the part that I'm

5472.32 --> 5475.599999999999
very fascinated

5478.8 --> 5483.76
[Music]

5480.76 --> 5483.76
with

5504.24 --> 5507.41
[Music]

5509.84 --> 5516.96
no but as far as I'm concerned like

5512.44 --> 5520.96
Jesus is indestructible not because he

5516.96 --> 5524.2390000000005
is God and he is his son and no it's

5520.96 --> 5525.4
because of the power of His contribution

5524.239 --> 5528.159
and his

5525.4 --> 5530.879999999999
decisions and even the Antichrist

5528.159 --> 5536.5599999999995
Christianity

5530.88 --> 5536.56
delusion can't destroy his actual

5540.52 --> 5546.6
power it's it's like even if the last

5543.36 --> 5550.28
Christian the last person to know about

5546.6 --> 5553.88
him even as they would

5550.28 --> 5553.88
leave like it

5554.0 --> 5560.8
still it still can't destroy his power

5557.4 --> 5564.08
it's like his power will persist through

5560.8 --> 5565.119000000001
knowledge through practical knowledge

5564.08 --> 5570.08
you

5565.119 --> 5572.159
see Jesus's Insight was so powerful

5570.08 --> 5575.639
because it just

5572.159 --> 5578.0
works now better the more pure the

5575.639 --> 5581.08
background and the context the better

5578.0 --> 5583.48
right but it's like you can't get rid of

5581.08 --> 5586.44
it you can never get rid of that

5583.48 --> 5588.839999999999
knowledge it will always persist like

5586.44 --> 5591.239
even if you destroy exterminate

5588.84 --> 5592.8
Christianity all of it and forbid it

5591.239 --> 5596.28
destroy all the

5592.8 --> 5600.400000000001
Bibles can you imagine that I not

5596.28 --> 5602.36
me but even then you wouldn't be able to

5600.4 --> 5605.4
get rid

5602.36 --> 5608.32
of the actual influence of

5605.4 --> 5612.199
Christ through the wisdom

5608.32 --> 5615.239
because it's become people humanity and

5612.199 --> 5619.5199999999995
even the powers have become inevitably

5615.239 --> 5621.44
dependent upon aspects of it for

5619.52 --> 5625.119000000001
existence

5621.44 --> 5628.96
itself you can never get rid of it

5625.119 --> 5628.96
ever even when it's

5630.56 --> 5636.84
unknown

5633.159 --> 5638.638999999999
because the wisdom itself will find its

5636.84 --> 5641.4400000000005
way through even if it's not called

5638.639 --> 5641.4400000000005
Christianity

5641.8 --> 5648.04
anymore it's out there now it's gone

5645.04 --> 5650.84
around it and that means it's also come

5648.04 --> 5653.84
with us to the afterlife and

5650.84 --> 5658.0
back you can never get rid of it

5653.84 --> 5661.639
anymore when something is known it can

5658.0 --> 5665.679
never be completely forgotten again if

5661.639 --> 5668.639
will always dwell in the subconscious in

5665.679 --> 5671.4400000000005
the realm of subconscious

5668.639 --> 5673.76
information on the other side it was it

5671.44 --> 5677.0
will always have been there and

5673.76 --> 5677.0
therefore will always

5683.239 --> 5693.5199999999995
be Jesus used the force of No Force yeah

5688.679 --> 5698.0
Jesus Jesus didn't use Force but you can

5693.52 --> 5701.4400000000005
think of him using Force because

5698.0 --> 5704.32
effectively it was as effective as if he

5701.44 --> 5704.32
were using

5705.66 --> 5714.679
[Music]

5710.48 --> 5714.678999999999
Force okay I still got to think of a

5720.4 --> 5723.4
title

5740.14 --> 5751.71
[Music]

5750.4 --> 5759.099999999999
what

5751.71 --> 5759.1
[Music]

5767.04 --> 5770.4
I think that's a funny title

5778.8 --> 5783.76
actually yeah I'm going to use it so

5781.4 --> 5786.599999999999
Jesus didn't use Force but you can think

5783.76 --> 5786.6
of him using

5787.6 --> 5791.159000000001
Force I mean why

5792.46 --> 5795.499
[Music]

5796.639 --> 5802.56
not taking the typing test again no not

5801.36 --> 5806.36
right

5802.56 --> 5809.6
now I mean sure I'll do that tomorrow or

5806.36 --> 5813.28
something but uh yeah I'm going to be

5809.6 --> 5813.280000000001
rounding out the show soon because

5813.679 --> 5817.64
Flat Earth debate is going to be

5815.199 --> 5823.6089999999995
starting up in about 7 minutes from

5817.64 --> 5823.609
[Music]

5826.44 --> 5829.639999999999
[Music]

5835.88 --> 5839.14
[Music]

5840.199 --> 5843.199
now

5858.239 --> 5865.5599999999995
there shouldn't have fed started 50 no

5861.679 --> 5865.56
because there's a time change

5867.48 --> 5873.199
teret there's a time zone

5870.199 --> 5873.199
change

5873.83 --> 5877.01
[Music]

5880.36 --> 5888.44
is it one or two

5883.04 --> 5892.639
hours it the the time zone change is 1

5888.44 --> 5894.159
hour so it's now over here in the

5892.639 --> 5896.92
Netherlands

5894.159 --> 5899.719
it's 5 to

5896.92 --> 5902.119
three three is when Nathan normally

5899.719 --> 5906.199
starts Fe

5902.119 --> 5906.199
on the show on this channel

5910.96 --> 5916.44
live what video they discussing to I

5913.92 --> 5916.4400000000005
have no

5916.639 --> 5922.400000000001
idea I don't know if they've gotten to

5919.04 --> 5925.159
that point yet it it might be a lot of

5922.4 --> 5927.48
Nathan just trying to test things out it

5925.159 --> 5929.5199999999995
dude might even like crash immediately

5927.48 --> 5932.08
we don't know

5929.52 --> 5934.679
yet let's hope every everything just

5932.08 --> 5934.679
works out

5953.679 --> 5959.32
immediately as well stay here the rwi

5960.04 --> 5966.159
what

5962.36 --> 5969.159
yeah there's so many people in chat it's

5966.159 --> 5972.96
great I feel very lucky today I'm so

5969.159 --> 5975.239
happy that I'm not like like yesterday

5972.96 --> 5977.4
so I'm not in pain yeah I didn't really

5975.239 --> 5979.0
want to complain about it because

5977.4 --> 5980.5199999999995
complaining about it doesn't help

5979.0 --> 5983.88
actually makes it

5980.52 --> 5985.0
worse and I'm just feeling so much

5983.88 --> 5987.52
better

5985.0 --> 5990.0
today and I'm fluid and we're having

5987.52 --> 5994.119000000001
this conversation I'm rolling out my

5990.0 --> 5997.4
idea right I mean this idea that I have

5994.119 --> 6000.598999999999
about Christianity actually being

5997.4 --> 6004.08
anti-christianity without realizing it

6000.599 --> 6008.08
it's a pretty risque idea like I it

6004.08 --> 6011.159
makes me a bit nervous a little and I

6008.08 --> 6014.159
really don't mean to

6011.159 --> 6017.96
be I don't mean to be evil with it at

6014.159 --> 6019.96
all I it's very serious it's very risky

6017.96 --> 6023.96
and I'm

6019.96 --> 6027.44
like I hope to see other people like

6023.96 --> 6030.199
considering this and if anybody Owen

6027.44 --> 6031.48
Benjamin seems to be considering things

6030.199 --> 6034.719
like

6031.48 --> 6036.48
this also very funny like he brought on

6034.719 --> 6041.4
his last show

6036.48 --> 6044.36
Friday up up about Jesus and how

6041.4 --> 6047.48
like he's pretty much signing with the

6044.36 --> 6050.159
story that I laid down that there was a

6047.48 --> 6054.36
double that he had the the lesbian

6050.159 --> 6058.5199999999995
double in in the end that he went to

6054.36 --> 6058.5199999999995
Argentina and Antarctica

6060.52 --> 6066.159000000001
potentially so Owen is kind kind of

6063.159 --> 6070.36
stepping away from that joke originally

6066.159 --> 6072.96
saying that oh no he was always a woman

6070.36 --> 6074.839999999999
like uh

6072.96 --> 6078.4800000000005
no not

6074.84 --> 6081.360000000001
so that's extreme like always a woman

6078.48 --> 6085.598999999999
going through like World War

6081.36 --> 6089.159
like that and then still staying on top

6085.599 --> 6092.04
no that just does not happen

6089.159 --> 6094.44
ever right so I'm convinced they are two

6092.04 --> 6094.44
different

6094.719 --> 6100.159
people and and man I wish in a way that

6097.8 --> 6102.360000000001
I could just have a conversation with

6100.159 --> 6106.36
Owen about

6102.36 --> 6109.48
this just to like duke it out because

6106.36 --> 6113.04
Owen has had so much book research that

6109.48 --> 6117.36
I did not have by the way I have no I

6113.04 --> 6117.36
barely have read any books in my life

6117.84 --> 6123.28
really and even though that helped me to

6120.639 --> 6126.4400000000005
keep my mind clear in

6123.28 --> 6129.08
ways I do sometimes just miss the

6126.44 --> 6129.08
specialist

6129.239 --> 6135.48
knowledges that you do get when you

6131.679 --> 6135.4800000000005
really study into a specific

6135.599 --> 6143.84
subject for me that specific subject was

6138.599 --> 6147.679
really like symbol is M and that sort of

6143.84 --> 6150.96
thing symbols and patterns so I just did

6147.679 --> 6153.719
my own thing not like

6150.96 --> 6157.28
a pile of material that I studied I

6153.719 --> 6160.2390000000005
didn't do that really not really anyway

6157.28 --> 6162.199
I'm rounding out thanks everyone for

6160.239 --> 6164.959999999999

6162.199 --> 6166.28
