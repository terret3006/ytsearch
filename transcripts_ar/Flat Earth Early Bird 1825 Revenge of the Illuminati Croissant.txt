98.72 --> 104.479
lot it's mostly

101.52 --> 107.28
clouded again it's not raining it's been

104.479 --> 110.36
raining like all

107.28 --> 113.799
night and keeps like during the show

110.36 --> 115.759
drying up but I'm okay with that because

113.799 --> 118.60000000000001
I usually tend to get cranky when it's

115.759 --> 118.6
raining during my

118.84 --> 122.96000000000001
show so I don't

124.079 --> 127.079
mind

129.959 --> 136.959
right oh man there's just so much water

134.0 --> 140.44
everywhere like the field there just has

136.959 --> 143.28
this pool sitting there and it's not and

140.44 --> 143.28
it's not going

145.2 --> 148.44
down all

148.76 --> 151.76
right

160.519 --> 167.0
okay hello Albert

162.76 --> 167.0
tlock hello Tommy good to see

168.959 --> 171.959
you

176.48 --> 183.64
yeah right so it is Thursday the 4th of

180.959 --> 183.64000000000001
January

186.12 --> 191.59900000000002
2024 let check the

189.08 --> 194.59900000000002
temperature 8°

191.599 --> 194.599
C

208.519 --> 214.20000000000002
okay right right so how you guys doing

211.28 --> 216.72
I'm late so it's going to be short show

214.2 --> 219.48
but I'm going to make the most of it and

216.72 --> 219.48
just compress

220.68 --> 226.84
it all right but yeah I'm having night

224.0 --> 231.319
issues this night

226.84 --> 235.56
again but I mean yeah I'm also

231.319 --> 237.64
like sort of sickish not really

235.56 --> 240.439
though

237.64 --> 243.64
just at night man like

240.439 --> 246.07899999999998
especially this night just my guts just

243.64 --> 246.07899999999998
being

246.439 --> 252.959
painful like yeah I mean they've had

250.04 --> 256.59999999999997
that before but it like it it's been

252.959 --> 260.0
like getting back recently I really

256.6 --> 262.36
wonder if that's because of the

260.0 --> 264.479
coffee I mean if it's not just a

262.36 --> 266.40000000000003
periodic thing and it's not going to die

264.479 --> 268.75899999999996
down by itself then I'm going to have to

266.4 --> 272.32
completely quit coffee again because

268.759 --> 275.199
then it very likely linked because it

272.32 --> 278.32
really started to get back when I

275.199 --> 282.16
started to drink coffee

278.32 --> 284.24
again I think vaguely remember from when

282.16 --> 286.16
I quit coffee the first time that it was

284.24 --> 288.6
also an

286.16 --> 292.44
issue but then it didn't really go away

288.6 --> 292.44
and I had to quit the green tea as

292.84 --> 299.28
well right but I'll figure it out I mean

297.52 --> 304.08
while it's happening I can still do

299.28 --> 307.67999999999995
pretty intense healing and all that just

304.08 --> 311.56
like basically just

307.68 --> 313.56
giving spiritual pain relief and it

311.56 --> 316.6
really works it's like

313.56 --> 319.4
oh if I only had some drug I could just

316.6 --> 320.68
not feel that pain or I can literally

319.4 --> 323.67999999999995
just

320.68 --> 326.8
like make the nerves that are like

323.68 --> 330.44
signaling that for whatever reason just

326.8 --> 334.24
like bypass them like

330.44 --> 336.71999999999997
their energy I can just like instead of

334.24 --> 340.44
like it routing into doing what it's

336.72 --> 340.44000000000005
normally doing I can basically

340.479 --> 347.71999999999997
like yeah like give it another electric

344.6 --> 350.319
line to go through instead of the normal

347.72 --> 352.88000000000005
route it does feel like that sometimes

350.319 --> 356.319
like I'm using my hand I'm just putting

352.88 --> 359.08
it there and it feels like suddenly the

356.319 --> 360.08000000000004
normal wires just wire in a different

359.08 --> 362.52
way

360.08 --> 365.639
and I mean it does freaking hurt my arm

362.52 --> 367.68
when I do that but it yeah it's just

365.639 --> 369.28000000000003
like getting really cramped up but I

367.68 --> 374.0
mean it's my

369.28 --> 374.0
arm and it can take

375.0 --> 382.319
it

377.599 --> 384.36
right and I mean it does really help so

382.319 --> 387.199
but yeah having a bit of issues here and

384.36 --> 391.40000000000003
there and then being late regularly it's

387.199 --> 391.40000000000003
also because of that

393.28 --> 397.919
all right but despite that I had a

395.319 --> 402.12
really good dinner

397.919 --> 405.12
yesterday took me long enough to make 3

402.12 --> 406.88
hours but I make made another ginger

405.12 --> 409.88
chicken

406.88 --> 409.88
thing

412.08 --> 420.039
rice like chicken ketchup mostly Ginger

417.199 --> 422.039
herb and uh

420.039 --> 423.12
yeah man that takes like three hours to

422.039 --> 426.71999999999997
make

423.12 --> 431.24
that it's like complaining like when do

426.72 --> 434.91900000000004
it ever end because it's like 3 hours of

431.24 --> 440.0
just cutting little cutting roots and

434.919 --> 443.639
onion and garlic in little blocks a lot

440.0 --> 445.639
like so much time spent doing that but I

443.639 --> 447.919
mean it is so worth it I mean I got a

445.639 --> 450.919
meal for like half a week and it's

447.919 --> 453.35999999999996
amazing it's my one of my favorite foods

450.919 --> 453.35999999999996
of all

456.68 --> 462.199
times right so let me describe the

463.24 --> 468.72
ingredients 3 hours hope I enjoy yeah

466.52 --> 471.4
like it's three hours work didn't eat it

468.72 --> 473.40000000000003
all in those three it's not like oh made

471.4 --> 475.4
three hours of work for one dinner no no

473.4 --> 478.4
no that's food for a

475.4 --> 481.0
while all right but it's yeah got

478.4 --> 484.0
chicken blocks and you cover it in a

481.0 --> 486.56
ginger powder turmeric powder a little

484.0 --> 489.159
bit of turmeric powder salt and pepper

486.56 --> 493.12
just let let it soak it

489.159 --> 495.24
in for a bit then bake that in olive

493.12 --> 498.879
oil not too

495.24 --> 501.84000000000003
hard uh and then yeah add the freshly

498.879 --> 505.12
cut stuff which you have to do before

501.84 --> 507.28
that because it just takes too much time

505.12 --> 509.879
your chicken will be all blacken and

507.28 --> 512.12
hard before you finish cutting it and

509.879 --> 515.44
adding it so you got to cut that ahead

512.12 --> 518.8
of time but yeah you cut fresh ginger

515.44 --> 523.7600000000001
root quite a bit of it like I got like a

518.8 --> 526.68
root like a whole Branch thing this big

523.76 --> 529.64
and like cut it all of it in little

526.68 --> 534.56
blocks takes

529.64 --> 537.08
forever and yeah cut onion and garlic

534.56 --> 541.92
also in little blocks just all of it in

537.08 --> 545.2
little blocks and then you add that to

541.92 --> 546.88
the to the chicken already a little bit

545.2 --> 549.1600000000001
baked

546.88 --> 552.32
up and then you add a little bit of

549.16 --> 553.8389999999999
water because like otherwise it's not

552.32 --> 558.279
really going to

553.839 --> 562.9590000000001
work it yeah and then you and add like

558.279 --> 564.8389999999999
the other details like more ginger syrup

562.959 --> 567.04
yeah more Ginger Ginger in every

564.839 --> 570.24
conceivable form is in that

567.04 --> 572.4399999999999
meal but it's also for the sweetness

570.24 --> 574.88
and some lemon juice for the sourness

572.44 --> 576.6400000000001
but you can also like use uh apple

574.88 --> 578.279
vinegar it's actually better but I

576.64 --> 581.72
didn't have

578.279 --> 583.48
any all right and you just let that stew

581.72 --> 585.72
for a while hello dank by the way good

583.48 --> 585.72
to see

586.32 --> 591.88
you and then I can actually show you of

592.6 --> 597.0400000000001
course yeah let me do that I'll be right

598.12 --> 601.12
back

628.36 --> 635.0
right but I mean this not the only thing

631.12 --> 635.0
because alongside that is

637.399 --> 645.6
also a little side dish of sual

642.56 --> 648.399
Bones right but first ginger chicken

645.6 --> 650.88
yeah guess what it's going to be looking

648.399 --> 654.32
yellow especially with all the turmeric

650.88 --> 656.48
root added on top of it but like yeah

654.32 --> 658.0400000000001
this is

656.48 --> 660.0
it

658.04 --> 664.279
and

660.0 --> 668.92
oh my God that that smells so

664.279 --> 671.76
good yeah but this stuff this is

668.92 --> 674.3199999999999
intense like for some people this is so

671.76 --> 677.519
intense tasting like you can just like a

674.32 --> 680.1600000000001
little scoop with a big bunch of rice

677.519 --> 683.0
because it's just so intense but it's

680.16 --> 686.68
supposed to be super

683.0 --> 688.8
intense right so there's that and then

686.68 --> 691.0
inside this your sble bones with this

688.8 --> 693.24
with is like green beans you cook it in

691.0 --> 694.959
water a little bit not too

693.24 --> 699.5600000000001
hard then

694.959 --> 702.1199999999999
you throw out the water and then you add

699.56 --> 704.88
more cut onions a different type of

702.12 --> 709.12
onion I Ed Purple Onion for

704.88 --> 712.12
that uh literally add like an

709.12 --> 712.12
entire

713.0 --> 718.44
uh

714.88 --> 722.279
sball like a a little pot sball entire

718.44 --> 724.6
thing in in there uh fresh cut Chili

722.279 --> 726.519
Peppers yeah that on top of that I I

724.6 --> 728.8000000000001
decided to put that on top of it because

726.519 --> 731.92
I don't think the SBO is is hot enough

728.8 --> 734.16
so I put some fresh Red Hot Chili

731.92 --> 737.279
Peppers cut in little blocks surprice

734.16 --> 741.959
surprise some Javan sugar sugar and

737.279 --> 741.959
coconut oil and then you get

742.24 --> 747.04
this which is it's kind of harden up

745.24 --> 750.92
because of the coconut oil but this is

747.04 --> 754.0
so good it's a side

750.92 --> 757.519
dish so that's that's another scoop of

754.0 --> 759.92
that alongside you get like the red and

757.519 --> 765.079
green stuff and you get the

759.92 --> 765.079
yellow with some rice this is so

765.92 --> 773.7199999999999
nice nice sized pot full yeah this is

770.0 --> 776.079
like food for another 3 days at least

773.72 --> 776.0790000000001
maybe

776.68 --> 782.92
more right so

780.199 --> 785.24
spent a lot of the evening doing

782.92 --> 788.24
that but it was all worth

785.24 --> 788.24
it

807.76 --> 810.76
right

836.12 --> 843.36
oh hey dank PayPal you say I love those

840.959 --> 843.3599999999999

850.24 --> 855.839
checking

852.279 --> 855.8389999999999
oh is it

867.68 --> 870.68
you

879.199 --> 885.519

882.04 --> 888.519
Dan that's a nice PayPal thank you very

885.519 --> 893.92
much that is going to be incredibly

888.519 --> 897.16
helpful cuz I was like really running

893.92 --> 898.8389999999999
out this gives me some breathing room

897.16 --> 900.3199999999999
for the rest of the month thank you very

898.839 --> 903.48
much dank for the

900.32 --> 903.48
support love

911.639 --> 921.04
it you use a razor blade to cut your

915.12 --> 925.639
garlic super okay that's kind of

921.04 --> 927.5999999999999
weird just got to do flight simulator oh

925.639 --> 930.6
really

927.6 --> 930.6
okay

931.199 --> 935.92
well they do make it like look super

933.639 --> 940.279
realistic at least

935.92 --> 942.16
now like it used to be super accurate it

940.279 --> 944.4399999999999
works really like the real thing but it

942.16 --> 946.639
was like super ugly vector graphics now

944.44 --> 949.639
they the graphics are just

946.639 --> 949.639
amazing

953.68 --> 960.5999999999999
naturally if you got the computer for it

956.88 --> 960.6
that can handle that kind of graphics

977.72 --> 984.9200000000001
oh yeah so yeah for the time being I'm

981.079 --> 987.7199999999999
kind of like suspending my habit of

984.92 --> 990.519
getting an Illuminati cant during the

987.72 --> 990.519
show because

991.56 --> 999.7199999999999
uh I think it's now two days

995.68 --> 1002.279
ago uh yeah I broke a tooth again or

999.72 --> 1003.88
rather one that's already kind of like

1002.279 --> 1006.56
had

1003.88 --> 1008.759
issues but it's now like kind of stuck

1006.56 --> 1011.7199999999999
there and it happened while I was eating

1008.759 --> 1014.72
in lumatic or something I think two days

1011.72 --> 1018.3190000000001
ago it's

1014.72 --> 1020.9590000000001
like but it's like stuck there sort it's

1018.319 --> 1023.24
not not a super bad situation I assessed

1020.959 --> 1026.559
it but it is

1023.24 --> 1028.839
like kind of like in the way and like

1026.559 --> 1031.12
I'm not just going to like on camera now

1028.839 --> 1033.839
eat if you know what I mean I have to be

1031.12 --> 1037.0
a bit more careful doing

1033.839 --> 1040.76
that right because I mean it's not even

1037.0 --> 1045.52
hurting like it'll just eventually like

1040.76 --> 1047.959
the gums will just let Let It Go

1045.52 --> 1050.72
and you'll get out I think even like

1047.959 --> 1055.48
eating this like ginger chicken kind of

1050.72 --> 1058.32
thing sort of helps that

1055.48 --> 1061.84
process of letting it go basically so

1058.32 --> 1064.24
it's like H bit

1061.84 --> 1066.12
weird but weirdly enough I'm kind of

1064.24 --> 1067.28
looking forward to it because it's going

1066.12 --> 1070.6
to make

1067.28 --> 1072.12
room cuz the thing that's like there was

1070.6 --> 1075.32
kind of in the

1072.12 --> 1078.039
way in

1075.32 --> 1079.8799999999999
ways so yeah looking at it from a

1078.039 --> 1082.6
different perspective instead of like oh

1079.88 --> 1085.44
my God my teeth are falling out I'm like

1082.6 --> 1087.559
oh yeah if that piece goes away it

1085.44 --> 1090.0
actually will be more

1087.559 --> 1093.52
convenient

1090.0 --> 1097.919
yay right as long as my front teeth are

1093.52 --> 1099.559
all excellent I'm perfect it's like Yay

1097.919 --> 1102.64
I'm

1099.559 --> 1105.52
very like the amount of care that I have

1102.64 --> 1108.72
for it is extremely little

1105.52 --> 1111.2
actually because like yeah it's just

1108.72 --> 1113.72
back there nobody gives a [ __ ] nobody

1111.2 --> 1116.76
can see that like I could open my mouth

1113.72 --> 1116.76
you wouldn't be able to see

1119.0 --> 1124.2
it I'd have to like really point it out

1121.799 --> 1126.6399999999999
and like you'd have to look up close

1124.2 --> 1129.4
because you can't see it so I don't have

1126.64 --> 1129.4
to worry about

1133.44 --> 1137.88
that but yeah I'm not going to eat

1135.48 --> 1139.52
Illuminati C on for a while on camera

1137.88 --> 1141.8400000000001
because just have to be a bit more

1139.52 --> 1147.2
careful with

1141.84 --> 1151.32
that until the situation like

1147.2 --> 1151.32
settles in there

1167.24 --> 1170.24
right

1171.039 --> 1177.52
all right also had a shower much

1174.12 --> 1181.3999999999999
needed it also helped a

1177.52 --> 1185.0
lot cuz like if you're like in pain or

1181.4 --> 1187.4
something the whole healing process

1185.0 --> 1189.12
works like what I do with energy works

1187.4 --> 1190.44
just so much better when the blood is

1189.12 --> 1192.9599999999998
all flowing

1190.44 --> 1194.72
everywhere so it's like taking a shower

1192.96 --> 1199.039
naturally assists that and of course

1194.72 --> 1202.28
also just helps like Universal

1199.039 --> 1204.96
stimulation of nutrient transport around

1202.28 --> 1204.96
the body and

1206.039 --> 1212.64
everything yeah like everything all

1209.12 --> 1216.32
those things I look at all of

1212.64 --> 1218.3600000000001
that like all my activities I'm like

1216.32 --> 1220.32
looking at it not like oh I'm just the

1218.36 --> 1222.6399999999999
person doing this and that no I'm just

1220.32 --> 1224.8799999999999
looking at like oh what is happening

1222.64 --> 1227.5200000000002
like with the organs and with the blood

1224.88 --> 1230.2800000000002
and and how does it affect my healing

1227.52 --> 1233.9189999999999
ability it's like

1230.28 --> 1237.2
this complicated system that I'm just

1233.919 --> 1240.48
trying to figure out better and

1237.2 --> 1242.96
better like nobody yeah I don't think

1240.48 --> 1245.159
I've ever mentioned but like when I

1242.96 --> 1249.4
first discovered like my healing ability

1245.159 --> 1251.4
like uh my late teens and started reg

1249.4 --> 1255.6000000000001
using it more regularly like in my early

1251.4 --> 1259.2800000000002
20s I had like some real painful issues

1255.6 --> 1262.12
with it because I didn't understand

1259.28 --> 1265.28
what I was doing with it like what the

1262.12 --> 1268.2399999999998
what that is what it was that I was

1265.28 --> 1268.24
doing even though it

1268.48 --> 1273.84
worked

1270.6 --> 1276.9599999999998
right but now I just understand it all

1273.84 --> 1279.3999999999999
so much better on intuitively alone but

1276.96 --> 1281.88
I'm just starting to realize like that

1279.4 --> 1286.3200000000002
blood itself the blood flowing in your

1281.88 --> 1289.279
body like has a mechanical

1286.32 --> 1291.6
function probably with in my healing

1289.279 --> 1294.279
process within the healing that I do

1291.6 --> 1298.12
blood is involved I feel like I feel

1294.279 --> 1300.72
it's like electric and blood is

1298.12 --> 1303.039
electric hey slowo moony good to see you

1300.72 --> 1303.039
hello

1303.32 --> 1312.8799999999999
Earthling what was in that cro

1306.72 --> 1312.88
nothing it's just I bit I bit down on it

1317.039 --> 1321.6
incorrectly

1319.279 --> 1323.2
right it was like a risky sit like

1321.6 --> 1325.12
there's like there was like a piece of

1323.2 --> 1328.679
tooth like sticking out there that

1325.12 --> 1331.1589999999999
didn't have a stable Foundation really

1328.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
anymore so it's just biting down wrong

1331.159 --> 1333.8400000000001
on it and

1335.799 --> 1343.48
Clack right because it wasn't like

1338.96 --> 1346.88
connected up to the rest of the tooth to

1343.48 --> 1348.6
redistribute the pressures coming on it

1346.88 --> 1352.2
right that's kind of the sit situation

1348.6 --> 1352.1999999999998
and that's why that happened

1352.64 --> 1355.96
so the weird thing is that it happened

1355.039 --> 1359.84
so

1355.96 --> 1359.8400000000001
quickly I didn't expect

1360.44 --> 1364.8400000000001
that I thought I would be like walking

1362.88 --> 1366.4
around with that situation for like half

1364.84 --> 1369.9189999999999
a year at least before anything would

1366.4 --> 1372.72
happen but it actually happened quite

1369.919 --> 1375.76
quickly cuz that started with like just

1372.72 --> 1379.32
a tiny piece of filling falling out like

1375.76 --> 1382.1589999999999
uh I think that happened during Christ

1379.32 --> 1385.1589999999999
Christmas somewhere around

1382.159 --> 1386.7600000000002
there all right anyway it's boring I

1385.159 --> 1391.44
don't really like to talk about it but

1386.76 --> 1391.44
in this case it is like

1391.48 --> 1396.799
affecting what I'm doing so I'm I'm

1394.36 --> 1399.08
mentioning it because I don't really

1396.799 --> 1400.34
want to like always talk about like oh

1399.08 --> 1403.46
my medical

1400.34 --> 1403.4599999999998
[Music]

1406.039 --> 1409.8799999999999
issues right I'm managing

1414.0 --> 1419.96
anyway but it does almost feel like

1417.36 --> 1422.6
there's just like a weird piece of tooth

1419.96 --> 1426.08
like sort of loose and it almost it it

1422.6 --> 1429.0
kind of feels intuitively like oh I'm

1426.08 --> 1430.9189999999999
losing my tooth as a little kid like

1429.0 --> 1434.559
that it's kind of stuck there and you

1430.919 --> 1434.5590000000002
wobbly it's like

1435.52 --> 1439.8799999999999
huh flashbacks

1441.36 --> 1448.12
except this one's is going to stay gone

1443.679 --> 1450.679
pretty much but oh well who cares like

1448.12 --> 1452.12
I'm very capable of like chewing and

1450.679 --> 1456.159
enjoying my

1452.12 --> 1460.4399999999998
food with what I got so it's all

1456.159 --> 1465.3600000000001
good right no complaints

1460.44 --> 1465.3600000000001
like Anyway revenge of the

1465.76 --> 1473.0
Illuminati ah

1469.679 --> 1473.0
that's hilarious Low Mo moon

1487.84 --> 1494.6
buggy one day an Illuminati Gran will

1492.12 --> 1494.6
eat

1496.76 --> 1504.8799999999999
you Illuminati C is made out of

1501.48 --> 1504.88
Arwin no it's

1507.36 --> 1512.6789999999999
not that will be

1509.679 --> 1512.679
freaky

1515.32 --> 1520.2
anyway no they're going to like update

1518.039 --> 1522.6
the ingredients to have like soil in

1520.2 --> 1525.76
green instead of vegetable Pace then I'm

1522.6 --> 1525.76
going to pass

1526.08 --> 1529.6789999999999
thanks uh

1552.039 --> 1559.679
what okay slowmo what

1556.679 --> 1559.679
that

1563.64 --> 1570.6000000000001
so were they literally old or did the

1568.44 --> 1571.919
did you hallucinate them being really

1570.6 --> 1574.9189999999999
old

1571.919 --> 1574.919
slow-mo

1576.919 --> 1582.64
what that's a weird story thanks for

1580.039 --> 1582.64
sharing

1586.6 --> 1589.6
though

1590.88 --> 1595.0
oh they were

1592.0 --> 1595.0
old

1606.799 --> 1614.6
right are they still

1610.399 --> 1617.6789999999999
around before I start making cruel

1614.6 --> 1621.08
jokes like maybe they'll have their own

1617.679 --> 1621.0800000000002
[ __ ] version as

1621.799 --> 1628.72
well still tour

1625.799 --> 1631.0
okay they're probably like we can't die

1628.72 --> 1633.559
we can't die we have to keep going we

1631.0 --> 1637.799
have to keep going as soon as we

1633.559 --> 1638.6789999999999
stop like the monster system will like

1637.799 --> 1642.12
will

1638.679 --> 1644.799
like like a the call of the Triffids

1642.12 --> 1646.9189999999999
will like create a pod with a [ __ ]

1644.799 --> 1650.039
version of us that will like take over

1646.919 --> 1653.159
the tour when we died we got to keep

1650.039 --> 1653.1589999999999
going we got to keep

1657.36 --> 1663.6
going I mean yeah that's kind of a joke

1660.64 --> 1666.3990000000001
isn't it but at this point is it

1663.6 --> 1669.48
really that far

1666.399 --> 1671.799
off oh we got a super popular band we're

1669.48 --> 1675.84
like we're astronomical everybody knows

1671.799 --> 1678.76
us uh yeah you better you better keep

1675.84 --> 1682.72
going you better like like have that

1678.76 --> 1684.76
brand name strong or like up with

1682.72 --> 1687.72
protection because otherwise like there

1684.76 --> 1690.72
will be like a [ __ ] clone version of

1687.72 --> 1692.84
you resurrecting to try and take your

1690.72 --> 1695.76
place like that will

1692.84 --> 1698.76
happen at this

1695.76 --> 1698.76
time

1701.279 --> 1709.24
so better keep

1704.039 --> 1712.44
going to protect your own music

1709.24 --> 1712.44
[Music]

1720.64 --> 1726.159
what

1723.039 --> 1729.399
put it's skeletons the stage

1726.159 --> 1732.0800000000002
weird yeah but I mean you got to realize

1729.399 --> 1735.039
though that those old

1732.08 --> 1736.399
these they're old right but I mean it

1735.039 --> 1739.399
does keep them

1736.399 --> 1739.399
going

1740.12 --> 1745.4399999999998
playing music is like very enervating

1742.32 --> 1745.4399999999998
for people that do

1753.96 --> 1760.8500000000001
that or it just pays really well and it

1757.159 --> 1763.91
just like they'd be crazy to give it

1760.85 --> 1763.9099999999999
[Music]

1765.36 --> 1770.039
up right but then it's going to wear on

1767.64 --> 1773.2
them over time though because it'll get

1770.039 --> 1778.08
boring if they're just doing it for the

1773.2 --> 1778.0800000000002
money the stall Century yeah yeah

1783.08 --> 1788.039
yeah right because all the new ones well

1785.88 --> 1790.159
they can only take the new format and

1788.039 --> 1793.1589999999999
then they have to be gay and whatever

1790.159 --> 1796.24
and all that [ __ ] and either they don't

1793.159 --> 1799.3200000000002
want to do it or the people don't want

1796.24 --> 1801.799
it so what are you going to get old

1799.32 --> 1805.48
people they're just going to keep going

1801.799 --> 1805.48
cuz they're just still doing their

1820.32 --> 1828.48
thing yeah Tommy well the Rolling

1825.159 --> 1831.2
Stones yeah MC Jagger is just just like

1828.48 --> 1833.3990000000001
attention horny too so like that guy's

1831.2 --> 1836.44
never going to get enough like he could

1833.399 --> 1839.32
fall apart be in a wheelchair and need

1836.44 --> 1839.3200000000002
still want to keep

1840.039 --> 1843.039
going

1856.24 --> 1862.76
so

1859.12 --> 1865.9189999999999
yeah slow-mo yeah that's yeah that's

1862.76 --> 1865.919
like the Mad Quantum of

1865.96 --> 1871.44
conscience like he's I heard him one

1868.76 --> 1873.84
time he talked about MC Jagger like the

1871.44 --> 1877.2
skeleton is like oh yeah they just have

1873.84 --> 1878.799
the he like being animated by Satan or

1877.2 --> 1881.8400000000001
something like you got to keep going you

1878.799 --> 1886.1589999999999
got to keep going got to keep doing the

1881.84 --> 1889.36
agenda and yeah I totally get that

1886.159 --> 1893.159
thinking but I mean I think that mger is

1889.36 --> 1896.76
just like actually enjoying it

1893.159 --> 1900.0390000000002
though doing that he probably kind of

1896.76 --> 1900.039
cranky outside of

1905.519 --> 1912.159
that but I don't know yeah I mean why

1909.96 --> 1914.279
speculate about it but you could think

1912.159 --> 1917.679
of it like okay the guy literally

1914.279 --> 1920.88
sacrificed everything to that thing

1917.679 --> 1923.919
to that thing that he does and he's like

1920.88 --> 1927.2
he always enjoyed that but now like he

1923.919 --> 1928.44
must enjoy it because he sacrificed

1927.2 --> 1931.48
everything for

1928.44 --> 1934.919
it so it could also be

1931.48 --> 1937.6
that like no he's doing that because he

1934.919 --> 1940.96
literally gave up

1937.6 --> 1940.9599999999998
everything for

1941.84 --> 1946.639
that and then it's like no I'm going to

1944.279 --> 1948.08
enjoy it until I literally drop dad

1946.639 --> 1951.039
doing it

1948.08 --> 1951.039
that might be what he's

1954.48 --> 1963.48
doing and I

1956.44 --> 1963.48
mean there's worse ways to go really

1967.6 --> 1973.6
so for a musician that's like the

1976.039 --> 1979.039
way

1981.08 --> 1984.559
what Chuck

1985.48 --> 1988.48
Perry

1988.88 --> 1995.3990000000001
what

1990.72 --> 1998.3990000000001
that's that is kind of

1995.399 --> 1998.399
bizarre

2000.48 --> 2007.159
my like what the [ __ ] so they rolled him

2003.2 --> 2009.679
out in dementia were they trying to see

2007.159 --> 2012.0
if the experience would wake him up out

2009.679 --> 2014.039
of it or something did they hope that he

2012.0 --> 2017.08
would just wake up and suddenly start

2014.039 --> 2019.679
playing again like he was the old self

2017.08 --> 2019.6789999999999
like what the

2035.96 --> 2038.96
[ __ ]

2041.399 --> 2046.4399999999998
people couldn't leave it but I mean if

2044.279 --> 2048.159
he was already in that state how was

2046.44 --> 2052.96
there even a

2048.159 --> 2052.96
tour or was he just a

2057.96 --> 2061.44
cameo I don't get

2063.2 --> 2069.56
it did they have

2065.72 --> 2070.839
like uh uh what do you call that an an

2069.56 --> 2073.879
yeah

2070.839 --> 2076.359
somebody what do you call that just a

2073.879 --> 2078.5989999999997
reenactment actor somebody that's like

2076.359 --> 2081.56
taking his place or so how what the hell

2078.599 --> 2081.56
was that setup

2082.119 --> 2086.2400000000002
then hey Richard G good to see

2091.159 --> 2096.2400000000002
you I'm going to turn on my coffee and

2093.679 --> 2099.2000000000003
I'll be right back good to see you all

2096.24 --> 2099.2
still got half half an

2125.8 --> 2128.8
hour

2154.319 --> 2160.64
right all right so I feel good now no no

2157.8 --> 2163.96
hurt in there if that coffee is going to

2160.64 --> 2166.8799999999997
like immediately make it

2163.96 --> 2167.88
hurt in that place then I know it's the

2166.88 --> 2170.96
freaking

2167.88 --> 2173.52
coffee so it's like almost like a final

2170.96 --> 2175.44
test which is kind of tragic because I

2173.52 --> 2179.96
was really starting to like the coffee

2175.44 --> 2182.839
again although it like the real wake up

2179.96 --> 2185.28
kick is starting to wear off also so

2182.839 --> 2188.56
maybe I just have to

2185.28 --> 2191.48
like maybe coffee with me is just like a

2188.56 --> 2193.2
periodic thing I take it for a while and

2191.48 --> 2195.2400000000002
then I have to

2193.2 --> 2198.64
quit I leave

2195.24 --> 2202.2
it and then after a

2198.64 --> 2204.2799999999997
while like in an opportune moment like

2202.2 --> 2207.52
when there's a lot of activity where

2204.28 --> 2210.119
there's a lot of planning or work a

2207.52 --> 2212.319
thing that is to be done like get it

2210.119 --> 2215.2400000000002
back and then I can get the active Boost

2212.319 --> 2217.72
from it to for to actual practical use

2215.24 --> 2221.52
instead of just oh I enjoy

2217.72 --> 2224.52
coffee right it's just I'm trying to

2221.52 --> 2228.0
re-evaluate how I do these

2224.52 --> 2232.16
things I want the the things that I

2228.0 --> 2235.24
consume all of it to have a stable

2232.16 --> 2238.7599999999998
practical use it has to have a

2235.24 --> 2238.7599999999998
reason to be

2238.88 --> 2245.1600000000003
there anyway man it's getting dark all

2241.44 --> 2245.16
of a sudden big cloud flying over

2245.599 --> 2248.599
there

2259.359 --> 2261.72
Bob

2265.839 --> 2272.599
Dyan I don't even know how he sings but

2269.319 --> 2274.8
I love Omen Benjamin doing Bob Dylan

2272.599 --> 2274.8
it's

2275.28 --> 2278.599
hilarious yeah

2282.079 --> 2288.4
terrible I hated

2285.04 --> 2290.079
it it's like it's annoying because some

2288.4 --> 2292.119
people like including my mother would

2290.079 --> 2293.2000000000003
say like oh no it's very respected this

2292.119 --> 2296.44
and

2293.2 --> 2296.4399999999996
that and

2303.76 --> 2309.8
like then is his there's the the deal

2306.839 --> 2314.0
with the devil interview [ __ ] God is

2309.8 --> 2317.3590000000004
that stupid I just can't stand the guy

2314.0 --> 2320.52
really or his

2317.359 --> 2323.04
music maybe he had a couple of

2320.52 --> 2325.8
interesting songs but probably not I

2323.04 --> 2328.079
would have actually remembered

2325.8 --> 2330.6800000000003
them but he's still going that's

2328.079 --> 2330.6800000000003
something I

2334.4 --> 2341.839
guess the ritual and

2338.04 --> 2344.92
anti-is anti-is

2341.839 --> 2349.0789999999997
establishmentarian he is you

2344.92 --> 2351.6800000000003
think positively for streat okay great

2349.079 --> 2355.0
song okay

2351.68 --> 2358.48
cool I don't know I don't recognize the

2355.0 --> 2360.72
name so that might be a good sign

2358.48 --> 2364.359
that it might be

2360.72 --> 2369.5989999999997
good hello seeking star

2364.359 --> 2369.5989999999997
water hey hello ter 3 6 good see

2385.8 --> 2391.88
you free tickets to P the number yeah

2388.88 --> 2393.92
slowmo because I mean seriously that guy

2391.88 --> 2398.8
sort of did deal with the

2393.92 --> 2401.8
devil like he's not not that good yet

2398.8 --> 2405.319
he's being treated like a superstar like

2401.8 --> 2407.079
that's a ticket that's literally one of

2405.319 --> 2410.319
those

2407.079 --> 2410.319
tickets with

2410.8 --> 2417.079
Satan that's what he did he basically

2414.359 --> 2417.0789999999997
confessed to

2417.839 --> 2424.319
it right and there's a lot of mediocre

2421.44 --> 2426.48
people by the way in media like that

2424.319 --> 2429.24
that are exactly in the same position

2426.48 --> 2430.72
they just take the ticket to the devil

2429.24 --> 2432.5989999999997
and then they get treated like a

2430.72 --> 2435.16
superstar in their field even though

2432.599 --> 2435.1600000000003
they're kind of

2437.52 --> 2440.96
mediocre that's a

2448.04 --> 2454.44
thing oh okay see that what thanks I

2451.0 --> 2454.44
guess I'm not going to listen to that

2455.319 --> 2458.319
now

2485.88 --> 2491.96
all right but every time I hear that guy

2488.88 --> 2494.52
it just reminds me of there's a a Dutch

2491.96 --> 2497.48
guy I always forget his

2494.52 --> 2499.88
name who's been like it pretty much the

2497.48 --> 2503.44
same setups pretty basic like with a

2499.88 --> 2506.88
guitar and just singing and he's made

2503.44 --> 2509.839
like hundreds and hundreds of songs it's

2506.88 --> 2511.88
all Dutch though but that guy is

2509.839 --> 2515.119
actually pretty good and I feel almost

2511.88 --> 2518.52
like Bob Dylan is like a wannabe clone

2515.119 --> 2522.28
of that guy in

2518.52 --> 2522.28
English what the hell is his

2525.16 --> 2529.68
name I feel really stupid for not

2527.76 --> 2532.6800000000003
knowing

2529.68 --> 2532.68
that

2535.56 --> 2538.7599999999998
H damn

2538.8 --> 2545.1600000000003

2578.76 --> 2585.2000000000003
good and very

2582.2 --> 2585.2
Dutch

2587.16 --> 2594.1189999999997

really which is like to me in a way sort

3284.76 --> 3287.7990000000004
of a pinnacle of

3289.48 --> 3293.96
Electro still going by the way that

3294.079 --> 3297.559
guy

3295.799 --> 3300.839
like I'm subscribed to his YouTube

3297.559 --> 3302.6400000000003

3300.839 --> 3306.16
little promos of like oh this is what

I've made

3311.28 --> 3320.76

it the theatrical side of it and then

3339.119 --> 3345.6400000000003
like I got from that point I kind of got

3342.16 --> 3348.68
drawn into

3345.64 --> 3351.319
metal but then like I figured like

3348.68 --> 3353.319
during the metal phase I figured out how

3351.319 --> 3355.92
[ __ ]

3353.319 --> 3360.2
up certain

3355.92 --> 3363.0
people really are It's like because I

3360.2 --> 3363.0
went there and

3364.0 --> 3369.16
went right because I went there all

3366.96 --> 3371.119
these people that were like certain

3369.16 --> 3373.52
types that had been like looking at me

3371.119 --> 3376.1600000000003
at a distance and kept their they

3373.52 --> 3380.2
suddenly like came to me and like oh so

3376.16 --> 3382.0789999999997
you're like really dark too and they

3380.2 --> 3385.8799999999997
would like it's almost like an evil

3382.079 --> 3388.799
coming out thing that they would

3385.88 --> 3390.76
and to me I sort of had that too but for

3388.799 --> 3395.72
me it was different because I had to

3390.76 --> 3399.6800000000003
push it I had I had to like

3395.72 --> 3401.72
Rebel in a way but not against God but

3399.68 --> 3404.0389999999998
against my

3401.72 --> 3407.7599999999998
own

3404.039 --> 3407.76
passivity I hope that makes

3408.24 --> 3413.5989999999997
sense but man I did I during that period

3411.16 --> 3416.8799999999997
I figured out how freaking messed up

3413.599 --> 3416.88
reality really is

3418.16 --> 3421.68
that there's people that have like

3419.76 --> 3424.4
compartmentalized

3421.68 --> 3427.0789999999997
Consciousness and that in these types of

3424.4 --> 3431.559
scenes that part comes out and it's

3427.079 --> 3434.6400000000003
really [ __ ] up and it's like actually

3431.559 --> 3437.6800000000003
dangerous not therapeutical time now

3434.64 --> 3439.44
those people actually conspire with that

3437.68 --> 3442.7599999999998
Spirit

3439.44 --> 3445.88
sometimes it's it's real evil

3442.76 --> 3449.48
there it dwells among

3445.88 --> 3452.48
it but on the scene even back then it's

3449.48 --> 3454.76
like the people that were really evil

3452.48 --> 3456.359
they were identified by the other people

3454.76 --> 3459.2400000000002
that weren't really evil that like to

3456.359 --> 3463.2799999999997
hang around that scene so there was like

3459.24 --> 3467.24
a split in that in a way all very

3463.28 --> 3469.7200000000003
intuitive but I was sort

3467.24 --> 3473.799
of

3469.72 --> 3475.319
not I wasn't abiding by The

3473.799 --> 3478.16
Format

3475.319 --> 3482.0389999999998
rebelling against everything including

3478.16 --> 3484.92
that including like the recognition of

3482.039 --> 3488.599
evil still knowing it for what was

3484.92 --> 3491.44
happening but not

3488.599 --> 3492.92
like I was just [ __ ] neutral in

3491.44 --> 3496.96
everything even when you actually

3492.92 --> 3496.96
shouldn't be now I'm not like that

3498.319 --> 3507.119
anymore but I was just the rage win man

3502.68 --> 3509.48
the rage win that is I found that in the

3507.119 --> 3511.92
metal scene I found that part of me

3509.48 --> 3514.16
that's like really

3511.92 --> 3518.119
sick of it

3514.16 --> 3522.72
all and the the sickness of appearances

3518.119 --> 3525.839
and of and not just like being

3522.72 --> 3529.2799999999997
direct but I had a lot of problems with

3525.839 --> 3533.0389999999998
that in society it's like that I can't

3529.28 --> 3533.039
just be super straightforward

3533.72 --> 3540.16
honest cuz I

3535.92 --> 3542.599
just I'm like from birth naturally

3540.16 --> 3548.0389999999998
expecting that everybody just lives like

3542.599 --> 3550.079
that and they don't I do but nobody else

3548.039 --> 3553.119
does barely anybody else and the ones

3550.079 --> 3555.2400000000002
that do they over time become damaged

3553.119 --> 3557.6400000000003
kind of like I

3555.24 --> 3560.2
have because the world just doesn't do

3557.64 --> 3562.319
that and you can't handle that people

3560.2 --> 3564.839
don't do that and like when you're

3562.319 --> 3568.2
honest then people that are not honest

3564.839 --> 3569.2799999999997
they they start to conspire against you

3568.2 --> 3572.0789999999997
cuz they

3569.28 --> 3574.2000000000003
feel the

3572.079 --> 3576.119
contrast right you don't even have to

3574.2 --> 3578.799
know anything about them you don't even

3576.119 --> 3582.2400000000002
have to address them they just feel the

3578.799 --> 3582.24
contrast and they go after

3582.68 --> 3585.68
you

3589.92 --> 3594.359
anyway all the dudes that knew that

3592.28 --> 3596.6400000000003
joined the army were in yeah I knew a

3594.359 --> 3596.64
couple

3598.119 --> 3604.52
I knew Satanist that got into the army

3602.119 --> 3604.52
really

3609.4 --> 3615.64
creepy like really

3612.839 --> 3619.2799999999997
creepy pretty actual

3615.64 --> 3622.92
satanists I mean I don't have any leads

3619.28 --> 3626.559
to like oh child this or that thank

3622.92 --> 3626.559
God but

3627.039 --> 3634.8390000000004
they did do things that went pretty

3630.4 --> 3634.839
far that were like really messed

3643.44 --> 3647.96
up hello ili by the way good to see

3651.119 --> 3654.839
you you know what is even weirder though

3653.72 --> 3661.16
now that we're bringing up up the

3654.839 --> 3661.16
military for a bit cuz I'm just really

3661.88 --> 3668.039
wondering like a whole while back I knew

3664.96 --> 3672.0
a couple of people also through the

3668.039 --> 3675.039
gothic scene by the way it's a while ago

3672.0 --> 3679.16
that kind of turned out to be sort of

3675.039 --> 3681.0
Nazis like Neo-Nazi types and they were

3679.16 --> 3683.5589999999997
also like at those parties like oh

3681.0 --> 3685.599
stompy stompy oh reenactment oh we're

3683.559 --> 3687.2000000000003
just reenacting

3685.599 --> 3688.92
is Nazi out forms they're just

3687.2 --> 3690.3999999999996
reenactment and yeah there's people

3688.92 --> 3693.319
there that are literally it's just

3690.4 --> 3694.88
reenactment they're really not Nazis and

3693.319 --> 3696.88
they like continually have to bicker

3694.88 --> 3700.6800000000003
with people like no we're really not

3696.88 --> 3703.2000000000003
Nazis guess what among those people some

3700.68 --> 3706.2
are actually Nazis they're like no no

3703.2 --> 3710.2799999999997
we're just acting like Naz no they are

3706.2 --> 3710.2799999999997
secretly but they'll keep it really

3711.319 --> 3718.119
secret and I got to know some of those

3714.76 --> 3720.5200000000004
and even back like well I shared

3718.119 --> 3724.279
hallucinations with

3720.52 --> 3726.7599999999998
them got like the Dark World stuff like

3724.279 --> 3730.0
that happened with them sort of in the

3726.76 --> 3732.039
light version was

3730.0 --> 3734.24
after and

3732.039 --> 3738.4
then there's a good chance they're

3734.24 --> 3740.7599999999998
actually dead because they were even

3738.4 --> 3743.1600000000003
then on about there's something going to

3740.76 --> 3745.039
happen in Ukraine they they try to trick

3743.16 --> 3747.24
me into like

3745.039 --> 3750.0
getting in debt to them or something

3747.24 --> 3751.5989999999997
giving everything away they wanted me to

3750.0 --> 3753.92
go

3751.599 --> 3756.48
there and they were talking about like

3753.92 --> 3756.48
around

3756.68 --> 3764.1189999999997
2005 he was going to go there the guy

3759.359 --> 3766.359
that I knew that was like that and I try

3764.119 --> 3769.48
to warm like everybody that's going to

3766.359 --> 3772.799
go there is going to die yeah yeah

3769.48 --> 3772.799
that's right I said that in

3773.359 --> 3779.4
2005

3776.079 --> 3781.599
because hey when remember when all the

3779.4 --> 3785.119
Ukraine [ __ ] started going loose and I

3781.599 --> 3786.6400000000003
said like yeah no Russia's going to win

3785.119 --> 3790.0
like doesn't really matter what's going

3786.64 --> 3792.279
to they're going to win like Ukraine's

3790.0 --> 3794.48
going to be completely annihilated

3792.279 --> 3797.24
completely

3794.48 --> 3800.16
annihilated right I said that I said

3797.24 --> 3802.52
that right away why because I knew it's

3800.16 --> 3805.24
one of the parts that I actually through

3802.52 --> 3808.24
the big Dark World Vision you got a real

3805.24 --> 3811.0789999999997
scope on a real zoom in shot and

3808.24 --> 3813.279
basically seeing people getting blown up

3811.079 --> 3820.559
and their legs blown up yeah I got I got

3813.279 --> 3823.319
that part fun in Hell In in like 2001 97

3820.559 --> 3825.599
somewhere over there a nice four look

3823.319 --> 3829.44
that I knew like yeah Ukraine is

3825.599 --> 3832.1600000000003
absolutely [ __ ] like anybody that I

3829.44 --> 3834.559
care for that might for whatever reason

3832.16 --> 3838.92
want to be part of that War I got to

3834.559 --> 3838.92
warn them cuz they are all going to

3839.599 --> 3847.52
die and I wonder now is that guy did he

3844.559 --> 3850.0
actually take my tip because I really

3847.52 --> 3853.96
tried to warn him like from my Visions

3850.0 --> 3856.079
like please don't do that like save the

3853.96 --> 3859.039
battle for another day it's a trick it's

3856.079 --> 3860.76
a trap they're just trying to kill off

3859.039 --> 3863.7990000000004
all the

3860.76 --> 3866.4
Nazis and he was really shocked when I

3863.799 --> 3868.48
told him that in all serious it was very

3866.4 --> 3870.88
serious it was like grabbing him by the

3868.48 --> 3874.92
shoulders look him in in the eyes like

3870.88 --> 3877.88
dude like May I drop that if I'm

3874.92 --> 3882.359
lying I really because I cared about

3877.88 --> 3887.2400000000002
that guy despite him being a Nazi he had

3882.359 --> 3890.5589999999997
very interesting qualities and he was a

3887.24 --> 3893.68
very he had a lot of knowledge just good

3890.559 --> 3895.48
tricks I learned some things from him

3893.68 --> 3897.72
and it was like that knowledge just

3895.48 --> 3900.559
needs to be preserved that was my

3897.72 --> 3903.3999999999996
attitude I don't know I don't know if

3900.559 --> 3905.52
he's still out there or that he actually

3903.4 --> 3907.799
did go to Ukraine and then he's probably

3905.52 --> 3907.799
dead

3910.119 --> 3916.44
now he might have been in some way like

3913.2 --> 3920.2
contractually bound that he like took

3916.44 --> 3922.279
money from Nazis and then they basically

3920.2 --> 3924.5989999999997
Force you it's like okay here now you

3922.279 --> 3927.0
pay us back you pay us back by in

3924.599 --> 3931.119
listing if you try to flee we will find

3927.0 --> 3931.119
you and kill you like that's the

3935.44 --> 3940.799
thing he might have been in that

3939.2 --> 3943.359
situation I'm not

3940.799 --> 3945.16
sure I didn't really ask further I

3943.359 --> 3948.799
didn't like want to

3945.16 --> 3950.8799999999997
be getting involved right but I mean

3948.799 --> 3955.279
this is the kind of thing that I was

3950.88 --> 3958.279
sort of doing back then like getting

3955.279 --> 3960.96
myself in like involved in not really

3958.279 --> 3964.16
involved but my nose dipped into like

3960.96 --> 3966.88
really complicated and Shady situations

3964.16 --> 3970.2
just to try to figure out what the hell

3966.88 --> 3971.88
is real man what is actually really

3970.2 --> 3973.72
happening not all the oh blah blah blah

3971.88 --> 3975.88
it's supposed to be yeah yeah yeah no

3973.72 --> 3979.48
what is actually happening how does it

3975.88 --> 3982.279
actually happen and I and I got to

3979.48 --> 3984.359
stumble upon this really unexpectedly

3982.279 --> 3985.76
too I never thought like when I got to

3984.359 --> 3988.319
know these people like that they were

3985.76 --> 3993.8390000000004
going to turn out to be

3988.319 --> 3993.839
Nazis they were just like into Nordic

3994.68 --> 4001.1189999999997
stuff I didn't think that that would

3997.68 --> 4004.24
actually lead to like

4001.119 --> 4005.88
real the real hardcore

4004.24 --> 4008.4799999999996
stuff

4005.88 --> 4011.96
and I think that with most people that

4008.48 --> 4014.96
are into that that religion old religion

4011.96 --> 4017.039
is more like just a format is just

4014.96 --> 4019.64
they're not really into the really

4017.039 --> 4019.6400000000003
creepy

4024.92 --> 4031.559
parts but I guess that some of the Nazis

4028.4 --> 4035.359
like really are into the creepy

4031.559 --> 4038.44
parts freaky stuff all right anyway this

4035.359 --> 4038.44
is as far as I'm going to

4039.2 --> 4042.9199999999996
go how the hell did I get stumble upon

4042.039 --> 4045.92
that

4042.92 --> 4045.92
subject

4046.079 --> 4051.8390000000004
oh yeah

4047.799 --> 4056.48
Army how one sentence can just

4051.839 --> 4056.48
like roll me into all

4061.96 --> 4067.68
that yes elg yeah that's but that's

4065.119 --> 4070.2400000000002
always how they work satanists they

4067.68 --> 4073.5589999999997
always get you involved in things that

4070.24 --> 4075.9599999999996
you don't understand and the real trick

4073.559 --> 4078.799
is after you figure it out right the

4075.96 --> 4081.0
real trial for Satanist is when you find

4078.799 --> 4083.72
out are you going to

4081.0 --> 4087.76
stop or will you continue when you

4083.72 --> 4087.7599999999998
continue that's when you are the

4101.839 --> 4105.839
Satanist right but I mean most things

4104.92 --> 4109.319
now

4105.839 --> 4111.4
coming being Unleashed on the people is

4109.319 --> 4115.120000000001

4536.0 --> 4545.32
illegal because he will never ever give

[ __ ]

4598.4 --> 4605.4
uh

4601.08 --> 4608.88
right I think yeah L debate has

4605.4 --> 4613.44
started right so until the next video

4608.88 --> 4615.88
keep it flat and yeah false PR Promises

4613.44 --> 4619.28
of money for proving it's a flat Earth

4615.88 --> 4622.36
yeah shove it up your ass you'd be in

4619.28 --> 4626.5599999999995
jail if it were up to me

4622.36 --> 4628.639
yeah false promises never ever delivered

4626.56 --> 4631.280000000001
under any conditions right the

4628.639 --> 4633.4400000000005
conditions for like how that's going to

4631.28 --> 4636.36
work yeah guess what yeah those

4633.44 --> 4640.32
standards are really fluid so it's just

4636.36 --> 4642.04
mun says oh he didn't prove it and guess

4640.32 --> 4645.4
what yeah that means you don't get the

4642.04 --> 4648.12
money because it's completely arbitrary

4645.4 --> 4651.5599999999995
because any proof that mun refuses to

4648.12 --> 4655.199
recognize as proof will allow him to not

4651.56 --> 4655.1990000000005
give the money
