162.64 --> 167.2
insane

163.68 --> 170.48000000000002

he called me up uh pretty late but it

170.48 --> 174.64
yeah we had a really fun conference yeah

172.4 --> 176.64000000000001
fun and intense conversation that lasted

174.64 --> 181.67999999999998
like three hours so

176.64 --> 181.67999999999998

202.48 --> 209.51899999999998
and thank you for sharing good servant

207.04 --> 213.0
but you had the number wrong because

209.519 --> 215.76
it's flattered early bird number 650 not

213.0 --> 218.56
660.

215.76 --> 220.319
but i appreciate that you yeah that you

218.56 --> 223.599
put

220.319 --> 226.79899999999998
the extra text with that link

223.599 --> 230.0
thank you

226.799 --> 232.08
yeah i was a bit of a in a crowdy mood

230.0 --> 240.239
this morning and that showed itself in

232.08 --> 245.36
the early bird chat but

240.239 --> 245.36
uh it's it's okay good servant

246.56 --> 250.48
if you can edit those by the way

250.959 --> 255.12
yeah although yeah you have to then edit

253.68 --> 258.0
every

255.12 --> 259.519
separate line you posted but you can

258.0 --> 268.16
edit it

259.519 --> 270.56
but yeah thank you for the effort

268.16 --> 272.08000000000004
yeah david weiss uploaded the video i

270.56 --> 274.8
just saw it being uploaded i haven't

272.08 --> 274.8
seen it though

279.919 --> 284.71999999999997
so anybody in here noticed yesterday's

283.44 --> 289.44
hangout

284.72 --> 292.639
also ended up with the zero votes

289.44 --> 292.639
isn't that just special

294.96 --> 299.59999999999997
so yeah even right now and i remember

298.16 --> 302.72
that

299.6 --> 304.16
i think i asked good servant pressed

302.72 --> 307.12
ahead

304.16 --> 310.47900000000004
to upvote it yesterday but it's just set

307.12 --> 313.199
back to zero now

310.479 --> 315.84
flutter 30 bird number 649 and it was a

313.199 --> 318.88
pretty good show so yeah they

315.84 --> 318.88
they didn't like it again

320.08 --> 324.15999999999997
because they set the up votes to zero

322.0 --> 325.36
and they had all kinds of troll comments

324.16 --> 328.16
again

325.36 --> 331.28000000000003
that thought that oh we got it we got

328.16 --> 333.84000000000003
irwin because now we can

331.28 --> 334.32
try to peer pressure him with that [ __ ]

333.84 --> 337.19899999999996
like

334.32 --> 337.199
like that matters

337.36 --> 340.47900000000004
you know in the end it's only gonna just

339.6 --> 343.68
make me

340.479 --> 345.59999999999997
look like more of an of a secret threat

343.68 --> 348.0
that's being secretly suppressed so i

345.6 --> 350.88
must be very effective then

348.0 --> 352.96
and yeah you know i don't even need

350.88 --> 355.039
those hints because i already know i'm

352.96 --> 356.71999999999997
effective

355.039 --> 359.28
because there is people out there that

356.72 --> 361.68
do give me really good feedback

359.28 --> 363.44
and highlight things to me like for

361.68 --> 365.919
example rasta hat

363.44 --> 367.84
i really appreciate that because he has

365.919 --> 368.479
a very sharp eye and he really just

367.84 --> 371.28
points at

368.479 --> 371.28
situations

371.52 --> 375.84
and yeah i do notice those situations

373.52 --> 378.71999999999997
but i get kind of used to them

375.84 --> 379.75899999999996
so i just tend to glance over it until

378.72 --> 383.199
i'm just

379.759 --> 387.199
too annoyed to do that and then i

383.199 --> 389.68
uh yeah i might push back

387.199 --> 390.8
but i know i'm effective i know i come

389.68 --> 394.96
up with

390.8 --> 397.52000000000004
good concepts i explain things

394.96 --> 399.84
better and better and yeah not

397.52 --> 404.08
everybody's like that

399.84 --> 404.08
well people are trying so

406.24 --> 410.56
right yeah and like i said yesterday i'm

409.199 --> 413.36
gonna keep on going

410.56 --> 413.36
until the end

413.68 --> 419.039
just it's not even out of desperation

417.52 --> 421.35999999999996
it's just because this

419.039 --> 423.84
right now it seems the only viable

421.36 --> 423.84000000000003
course

423.919 --> 427.28
it's just the only viable thing kind of

426.24 --> 431.12
left for me to do

427.28 --> 433.11999999999995
at this point and i do feel like there's

431.12 --> 436.56
yeah that it's a it's a good road

433.12 --> 440.08
there's more coming up even had some

436.56 --> 440.08
interesting dreams about that

442.24 --> 445.84000000000003
like before i went to bed

446.72 --> 452.47900000000004
i had like the day before

450.0 --> 454.479
i had a pretty dark night i even said

452.479 --> 456.31899999999996
that it was weird it almost felt like i

454.479 --> 458.31899999999996
was getting attacked by spirit well

456.319 --> 459.52000000000004
yesterday night i didn't have that at

458.319 --> 461.599
all

459.52 --> 465.84
although it was kind of i was a bit over

461.599 --> 465.84
exhausted because it was just too late

465.919 --> 469.12
it was interesting because i kind of

467.68 --> 471.12
like

469.12 --> 473.919
before i even went to sleep i already

471.12 --> 473.919
started dreaming

474.16 --> 481.68
and i was also directing my focus a lot

478.479 --> 484.479
i was like okay let's see if i can

481.68 --> 486.72
get myself to really focus on what i'm

484.479 --> 489.52
gonna do what i wanna do and

486.72 --> 491.68
what i could do what could i catch out

489.52 --> 494.87899999999996
of my dream

491.68 --> 497.599
and basically make it real not

494.879 --> 498.56
yeah not in a magical thinking kind of

497.599 --> 500.24
way but

498.56 --> 502.879
rather in an extra dimensional kind of

500.24 --> 504.72
way and

502.879 --> 508.08000000000004
i've really been trying this for some

504.72 --> 511.199
time and yesterday i really felt like

508.08 --> 515.279
like it was actually happening because

511.199 --> 518.32
i kind of started

515.279 --> 521.4399999999999
dreaming before i even went to sleep

518.32 --> 524.0
it's kind of funny because

521.44 --> 524.0
way back

525.2 --> 529.12
like that sort of thing typically

527.2 --> 532.5600000000001
happens but there is this weird

529.12 --> 535.04
element that if your conscious becomes

532.56 --> 537.5999999999999
like if i take pay attention in the

535.04 --> 539.36
moment that it's actually happening

537.6 --> 541.0400000000001
then usually just like typically with

539.36 --> 543.92
dreams

541.04 --> 545.5999999999999
it dispels it it's almost like this this

543.92 --> 547.76
quantum effect like okay

545.6 --> 549.2
you actually take notice of it then it

547.76 --> 552.399
goes away

549.2 --> 554.6400000000001
but in this half dream state that

552.399 --> 557.04
doesn't happen

554.64 --> 560.16
i don't snap out of it i stay in it it's

557.04 --> 560.16
really fascinating

560.24 --> 563.92
so yeah that was kind of an interesting

562.56 --> 567.1999999999999
experience

563.92 --> 571.36
i was basically looking into like a

567.2 --> 571.36
short-term midterm and long-term

575.12 --> 580.24
virtual ground represented in like

578.24 --> 583.44
energy frequencies

580.24 --> 583.44
like an energy field

583.839 --> 587.2
and and just it kind of showed me like

586.64 --> 589.4399999999999
yeah this

587.2 --> 591.0400000000001
is exactly what it's now and it made

589.44 --> 593.6800000000001
total sense

591.04 --> 594.3199999999999
then this is where where it's going to

593.68 --> 597.76
go

594.32 --> 599.9200000000001
and it was the same but different

597.76 --> 602.399
in a natural way i can't even describe

599.92 --> 605.519
it it's all literally situations and

602.399 --> 609.76
feelings translated into like

605.519 --> 615.12
some kind of weird color light spectrum

609.76 --> 615.12
yeah very ethereal

615.839 --> 621.2790000000001
but it yeah the thing is i can read that

619.519 --> 625.04
light spectrum but it's only

621.279 --> 628.16
for my spirit i have

625.04 --> 631.04
you know every thing i would do to

628.16 --> 632.959
literally try to explain it

631.04 --> 635.36
what it is that i saw and basically in

632.959 --> 637.1199999999999
that moment

635.36 --> 639.44
is just too difficult it would always

637.12 --> 640.32
become very convoluted and distract away

639.44 --> 644.0790000000001
from

640.32 --> 646.72
well from that concise assets

644.079 --> 647.279
so yeah you can't explain it you can

646.72 --> 650.88
only

647.279 --> 650.88
roughly describe what it's like

651.04 --> 656.959
right kevin horizon's waking trans

654.48 --> 656.9590000000001
dreams

658.56 --> 663.5189999999999
all right so i had i had one of those

661.12 --> 667.12
yesterday night

663.519 --> 670.5600000000001
and it's funny because yeah

667.12 --> 671.12
it it the way i recognize that it's

670.56 --> 673.8389999999999
actually

671.12 --> 675.6
real and not some inner projection that

673.839 --> 678.6400000000001
i'm trying to enforce to be

675.6 --> 681.0400000000001
real for myself is by

678.64 --> 683.76
that i look at it and then see things

681.04 --> 687.8389999999999
that i didn't expect

683.76 --> 689.6
based on my own typical ego insertions

687.839 --> 692.72
and that's kind of how i feel like

689.6 --> 695.6
there's something real going on here

692.72 --> 696.0790000000001
because there's elements to it that i

695.6 --> 699.76
didn't

696.079 --> 703.04
expect but i should

699.76 --> 704.64
but to see it despite having a virtual

703.04 --> 709.12
expectation to actually

704.64 --> 709.12
see that that's something different

710.16 --> 717.8389999999999
anyway hello julia pavin

722.24 --> 725.92
all right i see you corrected

726.24 --> 731.839
the titles thank you good servant

740.079 --> 744.0
birthing freedom demo oh yeah over mccoy

742.8 --> 747.4399999999999
i heard something about

744.0 --> 752.0
that or i read some titles didn't

747.44 --> 752.0
didn't watch it or read into it though

754.399 --> 760.88
oh man

758.88 --> 762.399
it's weird my shoulder is like really

760.88 --> 766.24
sore for some reason

762.399 --> 769.68
like really sore and it's funny because

766.24 --> 771.279
it almost feels like it's migrated from

769.68 --> 773.4399999999999
here to there

771.279 --> 775.8389999999999
because yeah my jaw situation seems to

773.44 --> 777.7600000000001
be completely stabilized

775.839 --> 780.24
when a couple of nights before i had

777.76 --> 783.519
like weird

780.24 --> 785.92
just was it

783.519 --> 787.279
cracking bones like you're just sitting

785.92 --> 788.88
there suddenly the pressure does

787.279 --> 791.77
something and it's like back

788.88 --> 793.36
ah like really this is

791.77 --> 794.8
[Music]

793.36 --> 797.2
that kind of starters yo when that

794.8 --> 797.1999999999999
happens

799.519 --> 803.519
it's like some people have like knee

801.6 --> 805.279
joints that get a little stiff and then

803.519 --> 808.5600000000001
it like really

805.279 --> 810.639
it like snaps and [ __ ] well that's

808.56 --> 812.7199999999999
that kind of experience but without

810.639 --> 814.16
joint movement it's not in the joint and

812.72 --> 817.0400000000001
it's like in the middle of

814.16 --> 817.68
basically your skull so that yeah

817.04 --> 820.56
because

817.68 --> 823.8389999999999
that snap really resonates through the

820.56 --> 823.8389999999999
rest of your bones so

824.16 --> 829.519
right but that kind of stopped very glad

826.48 --> 832.0790000000001
about it because it's extremely annoying

829.519 --> 832.5600000000001
but now yeah there i got a sore muscle

832.079 --> 834.7199999999999
in

832.56 --> 838.079
basically behind my shoulder or

834.72 --> 841.1990000000001
somewhere i can't even pinpoint it

838.079 --> 843.8389999999999
i'll get over that as well it's all

841.199 --> 843.8389999999999
normal

863.76 --> 870.8
i heard about co2 releasing

867.36 --> 872.8000000000001
with voice from inside points and joint

870.8 --> 885.4399999999999
what

872.8 --> 887.12
what do you mean

885.44 --> 890.9590000000001
right there was love by the way this

887.12 --> 893.519
article i posted in the early bird chat

890.959 --> 895.279
and right when i did i think adam meekin

893.519 --> 898.399
picked up on it

895.279 --> 900.079
because like not too long after that

898.399 --> 902.639
they started talking about it on the

900.079 --> 904.7199999999999
iron realm

902.639 --> 906.5600000000001
live on the show so i think anime can

904.72 --> 906.88
pick up on it and immediately put that

906.56 --> 910.8389999999999
for

906.88 --> 912.639
because it is kind of bizarre and

910.839 --> 915.0400000000001
interesting

912.639 --> 916.88
seems to be in development some

915.04 --> 921.92
non-lethal

916.88 --> 921.92
technology in this case lasers

922.079 --> 926.2399999999999
that that literally yeah when they hit

925.76 --> 928.639
you

926.24 --> 929.44
apparently they have yeah very

928.639 --> 933.279
fine-tuned

929.44 --> 933.2790000000001
sound technology that basically

934.079 --> 940.8
that is projected with the lasers

938.48 --> 942.5600000000001
so they kind of managed how to figure

940.8 --> 945.7589999999999
out how to

942.56 --> 948.8
yeah how to mix sound or how to use

945.759 --> 950.48
light lasers to bring across sound in a

948.8 --> 952.4799999999999
resonance way it has to be

950.48 --> 953.6800000000001
so they can basically when they point at

952.48 --> 957.279
you project

953.68 --> 960.399
messages that you will literally hear

957.279 --> 963.199
kind of freaky but also

960.399 --> 963.199
expected

965.04 --> 969.8389999999999
so let me post that in chat you can take

966.959 --> 969.8389999999999
a look

976.079 --> 979.92
co2 builds up and gets released in

978.639 --> 983.279
certain time spans

979.92 --> 985.8389999999999
that is fascinating over mukul really is

983.279 --> 989.36
that a thing

985.839 --> 990.0790000000001
that could be it it does feel like that

989.36 --> 992.9590000000001
there's just

990.079 --> 993.68
pressure building up and then it's just

992.959 --> 997.8389999999999
and then it

993.68 --> 997.8389999999999
yeah the pressure's away

1002.32 --> 1007.0400000000001
maybe that is it but that is really odd

1004.8 --> 1007.519
to me like where's the co2 then coming

1007.04 --> 1011.519
from

1007.519 --> 1014.24
how is that generated inside

1011.519 --> 1014.24
inside there

1022.24 --> 1027.439
heard that's the voice i don't know what

1024.24 --> 1027.439
you're saying over michael

1028.0 --> 1039.839
hey mark collard by the way welcome

1049.679 --> 1055.8400000000001
right uh yeah

1053.36 --> 1058.9599999999998
i don't know if ajm is listening and i

1055.84 --> 1058.9599999999998
got a little rough on him

1059.36 --> 1066.08
now i feel mixed about it

1063.44 --> 1068.0
because it's just that he does kind of

1066.08 --> 1069.84
annoy me he knows it

1068.0 --> 1072.88
he doesn't seem to know how to stop

1069.84 --> 1074.3999999999999
doing that even when i point it out

1072.88 --> 1077.44
it's like a little i kicked him out of

1074.4 --> 1081.6000000000001
the early bird chat because it just

1077.44 --> 1082.96
yeah like i tried to keep that chat for

1081.6 --> 1086.24
very serious

1082.96 --> 1089.3600000000001
conversations and information

1086.24 --> 1092.16
placement like videos and all that and

1089.36 --> 1092.4799999999998
i don't know he likes to just cover it

1092.16 --> 1094.799
with

1092.48 --> 1097.039
general banter and i don't appreciate

1094.799 --> 1097.039
that

1097.36 --> 1102.3999999999999
and he pissed me off so

1100.559 --> 1106.32
but yeah that doesn't mean that he's

1102.4 --> 1110.0800000000002
basic that he's not welcome in my chat

1106.32 --> 1111.6789999999999
just so he knows i'm a little grouchy

1110.08 --> 1115.6
today and yeah he got a

1111.679 --> 1115.6000000000001
he got a slap because of it

1117.039 --> 1123.84
yeah kevin horizons i i just post the

1119.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
link with that

1126.96 --> 1130.799
right walmart colored i guess you like

1129.28 --> 1137.84
that

1130.799 --> 1137.84
i typically don't like that

1143.12 --> 1148.4799999999998
but i do know that he doesn't mean any

1147.2 --> 1150.0800000000002
harm

1148.48 --> 1152.08
you know he gets a little squirty

1150.08 --> 1155.12
sometimes but i guess that we all have

1152.08 --> 1158.559
our moments like that

1155.12 --> 1165.84
he's not a mean person but it just

1158.559 --> 1165.84
pisses me off

1168.08 --> 1172.32
especially when i'm grouchy so anyway

1176.96 --> 1193.8400000000001
yes right more color

1193.919 --> 1197.6000000000001
i'll get in sick by the way

1204.84 --> 1207.84
right

1216.3 --> 1221.6
[Music]

1218.24 --> 1224.88
okay more colored i'll try not to

1221.6 --> 1224.8799999999999
bore you back to sleep

1229.12 --> 1235.84
but yeah uh

1241.76 --> 1247.36
i didn't make a lot of notes

1244.96 --> 1248.96
besides most of the night was just

1247.36 --> 1251.12
talking to rasta hat

1248.96 --> 1253.1200000000001
oh right yeah it was also watch the

1251.12 --> 1256.08
silly movie again

1253.12 --> 1257.4399999999998
spider-man 3. i hadn't actually just

1256.08 --> 1258.559
watched that thing i think that the

1257.44 --> 1261.6000000000001
first time i saw

1258.559 --> 1263.52
part of it it just pissed me off so bad

1261.6 --> 1266.24
because there's some really annoying

1263.52 --> 1270.08
parts in there as well

1266.24 --> 1272.0
it's like too stereotypical and [ __ ]

1270.08 --> 1273.6789999999999
and that pissed me off but i watched it

1272.0 --> 1276.72
again and yeah it's

1273.679 --> 1280.4
a bit draggy but

1276.72 --> 1283.44
it wasn't as bad as i remembered even

1280.4 --> 1286.0
some interesting parts but

1283.44 --> 1288.4
overall yeah it is it is what it is

1286.0 --> 1292.48
[Music]

1288.4 --> 1295.76
i mean the old spider-man 3 remember

1292.48 --> 1298.88
and yeah i don't know

1295.76 --> 1301.44
uh i thought that my conversation with

1298.88 --> 1303.919
rasta had was more interesting

1301.44 --> 1305.039
basically went through of well we

1303.919 --> 1309.2
basically

1305.039 --> 1311.2
reviewed a lot of people out there

1309.2 --> 1313.76
because there's just a lot of issues

1311.2 --> 1313.76
going around

1316.64 --> 1323.8400000000001
for some reason there is a trend going

1320.24 --> 1326.159
and it's everywhere

1323.84 --> 1330.32
also in the flat earth scene pretty much

1326.159 --> 1330.3200000000002
everywhere that for some reason

1330.4 --> 1337.679
it seems like there's a couple of really

1335.44 --> 1337.679
just

1339.36 --> 1346.1589999999999
dumb people i don't know else to say it

1342.4 --> 1349.039
just people that they don't got it

1346.159 --> 1349.44
and yet they're welcomed in like they're

1349.039 --> 1352.72
the

1349.44 --> 1355.76
the hottest latest [ __ ] ever

1352.72 --> 1357.1200000000001
this seems to be happening in a lot of

1355.76 --> 1360.08
places

1357.12 --> 1360.3999999999999
and it's creepy it's creepy because yeah

1360.08 --> 1362.8799999999999
with

1360.4 --> 1364.0
if you're got one group it's maybe a

1362.88 --> 1366.3200000000002
little annoying

1364.0 --> 1368.159
but when you notice that it's happening

1366.32 --> 1372.6399999999999
everywhere

1368.159 --> 1375.0390000000002
like every freaking media show

1372.64 --> 1375.76
seems to be doing that all of a sudden

1375.039 --> 1378.559
like it's

1375.76 --> 1378.96
the thing to do like oh we definitely

1378.559 --> 1382.24
need

1378.96 --> 1383.039
more dumb people now that talk more like

1382.24 --> 1387.44
the average

1383.039 --> 1390.799
[ __ ] because

1387.44 --> 1393.2
because that's essential

1390.799 --> 1395.039
to get more media coverage or something

1393.2 --> 1397.8400000000001
that's the only theory i could get out

1395.039 --> 1401.76
of it to justify that

1397.84 --> 1405.039
because like this is not

1401.76 --> 1408.72
helping intellectual development this is

1405.039 --> 1410.96
not helping clearing up situations

1408.72 --> 1412.72
it just turns everything into blabbering

1410.96 --> 1417.6000000000001
nonsense

1412.72 --> 1420.88
and that seems to be a trend

1417.6 --> 1421.1999999999998
the acceptance of fools not people that

1420.88 --> 1425.1200000000001
are

1421.2 --> 1425.44
wrong like ballers or that are deceiving

1425.12 --> 1428.799
but

1425.44 --> 1432.3200000000002
just blabbering nonsense yeah

1428.799 --> 1432.32
also kind of like agm

1432.559 --> 1436.32
but yeah ajm is not being put on a

1434.559 --> 1438.1589999999999
pedestal like he's the hottest

1436.32 --> 1440.48
[ __ ] out there all of a sudden and

1438.159 --> 1441.1200000000001
getting coverage on wide wide platforms

1440.48 --> 1444.96
and [ __ ]

1441.12 --> 1449.039
you know that's the difference

1444.96 --> 1451.2
so yeah rasta had really rubbed that in

1449.039 --> 1452.24
he always likes to emphasize that sort

1451.2 --> 1453.8400000000001
of [ __ ] you know

1452.24 --> 1455.52
and he's done that for a long time and

1453.84 --> 1457.4399999999998
the funny thing is that pretty much

1455.52 --> 1460.72
every person he criticizes and i'm not

1457.44 --> 1462.72
going to reveal everything

1460.72 --> 1465.039
he's always on target it's actually kind

1462.72 --> 1468.08
of annoying

1465.039 --> 1470.559
right but yeah

1468.08 --> 1472.3999999999999
one thing that i will talk about we'll

1470.559 --> 1474.48
get a little personal

1472.4 --> 1475.44
right i wonder if he even picks up on

1474.48 --> 1478.48
this

1475.44 --> 1480.96
is that for some reason on the flat

1478.48 --> 1484.84
earth debates

1480.96 --> 1488.08
yeah i everybody knows i don't always

1484.84 --> 1490.32
basically get the respect i deserve now

1488.08 --> 1493.6
sometimes i'm a little silly

1490.32 --> 1495.12
and then yeah it's okay to shove me

1493.6 --> 1496.0
aside that's fine because i'm kind of

1495.12 --> 1498.7199999999998
annoying anyway

1496.0 --> 1499.44
but yeah that's not the majority of the

1498.72 --> 1502.88
cases

1499.44 --> 1505.279
often i just very patient and then try

1502.88 --> 1507.3600000000001
to quickly put out a concise important

1505.279 --> 1512.32
point that everybody could get

1507.36 --> 1516.32
that will help and for some reason

1512.32 --> 1519.9189999999999
tenth man a lot of the times

1516.32 --> 1522.08
tends to literally waltz right over me

1519.919 --> 1524.72
either completely ignoring my point or

1522.08 --> 1527.76
even halfway interrupting my sentences

1524.72 --> 1528.0
and it's mostly him like others also

1527.76 --> 1529.84
have

1528.0 --> 1531.2
like they talk and then they realize oh

1529.84 --> 1533.6789999999999
somebody else is talking

1531.2 --> 1534.799
they stop i do that too you know let's

1533.679 --> 1537.919
do it sometimes

1534.799 --> 1539.44
like want to get in oh wait no oh he

1537.919 --> 1542.72
doesn't

1539.44 --> 1544.24
with me mostly

1542.72 --> 1546.48
and i even addressed him a couple of

1544.24 --> 1548.64
times live on the show like dude why

1546.48 --> 1550.159
are you just watching over my why i just

1548.64 --> 1553.919
made a good point why are you

1550.159 --> 1555.919
moving on like it didn't mean anything

1553.919 --> 1558.72
and yeah rest ahead has definitely taken

1555.919 --> 1561.919
notice of that i wonder why that is it's

1558.72 --> 1565.3600000000001
because it is kind of disrespectful

1561.919 --> 1568.96
and i am going to eventually

1565.36 --> 1572.1589999999999
get pretty rough and

1568.96 --> 1574.559
yeah 10th man thinks that he's

1572.159 --> 1576.96
that's all right well yeah that's not

1574.559 --> 1576.96
all right

1577.279 --> 1580.48
it won't be all right

1581.279 --> 1586.72
because i think i'm pretty critical

1584.96 --> 1588.72
to the flat earth debate yeah i said it

1586.72 --> 1591.76
i'm a critical component

1588.72 --> 1594.64
i bring a lot to the table i develop

1591.76 --> 1596.1589999999999
i master i master explanation which is

1594.64 --> 1598.159
an absolutely critical

1596.159 --> 1599.8400000000001
thing in the whole show and nathan

1598.159 --> 1602.0
values that greatly

1599.84 --> 1603.36
because he also tries to master

1602.0 --> 1606.32
explanations

1603.36 --> 1608.24
and qe also very much values it and i

1606.32 --> 1610.24
really appreciate that and it really

1608.24 --> 1612.559
gives me this

1610.24 --> 1613.679
brotherly feeling towards them too

1612.559 --> 1615.279
specifically

1613.679 --> 1617.8400000000001
oh there's two you know they're all

1615.279 --> 1617.84
pretty cool

1618.159 --> 1624.7990000000002
so yeah

1621.52 --> 1627.2
i'm gonna do something about that but of

1624.799 --> 1628.32
course only when i actually have a valid

1627.2 --> 1631.1200000000001
point to make

1628.32 --> 1634.3999999999999
it's not always the case sometimes i too

1631.12 --> 1636.559
just want to make a silly joke a little

1634.4 --> 1638.3200000000002
and then if somebody ignores that that's

1636.559 --> 1640.0
that's fine

1638.32 --> 1641.4399999999998
but when i'm actually trying to make a

1640.0 --> 1643.44
technical point

1641.44 --> 1645.76
and people watch over that that's not

1643.44 --> 1647.44
fine especially if it is

1645.76 --> 1649.039
not a regurgitated point that

1647.44 --> 1649.679
everybody's already heard a hundred

1649.039 --> 1651.679
times

1649.679 --> 1652.96
and they don't necessarily need it to

1651.679 --> 1657.3600000000001
hear it a hundred

1652.96 --> 1657.3600000000001
and one time in that specific moment

1660.72 --> 1669.84
so yeah

1670.159 --> 1674.3990000000001
right more colored and i appreciate the

1672.48 --> 1676.88
recognition

1674.399 --> 1678.32
now of course you guys on my show are

1676.88 --> 1682.72
are good

1678.32 --> 1686.799
you yeah

1682.72 --> 1686.799
you're very respectful sometimes

1686.88 --> 1690.88
more than i would even give me but then

1689.039 --> 1692.72
again i'm kind of a dick when it comes

1690.88 --> 1695.0390000000002
to respect towards myself

1692.72 --> 1697.3600000000001
just do my best not to be because it's

1695.039 --> 1700.1589999999999
not good

1697.36 --> 1701.12
but yeah i have a problem with myself

1700.159 --> 1702.96
like that in

1701.12 --> 1705.039
overcoming that problem and then when

1702.96 --> 1708.32
other people are doing it that's extra

1705.039 --> 1709.2
tough because i'm trying to not do that

1708.32 --> 1710.96
now of course when

1709.2 --> 1714.96
ballers try something like that yeah

1710.96 --> 1714.96
that absolutely doesn't work

1716.24 --> 1720.48
at all so yeah they can't stop trying

1719.12 --> 1723.4399999999998
but they won't because they

1720.48 --> 1724.0
they have to squirt they got to do it

1723.44 --> 1726.3990000000001
they don't

1724.0 --> 1728.96
have any other thing they can do in

1726.399 --> 1728.9599999999998
their life

1736.84 --> 1741.76
anyway

1739.679 --> 1742.799
right they seem to have a certain amount

1741.76 --> 1746.559
disdain

1742.799 --> 1748.96
for me which people specifically

1746.559 --> 1750.8799999999999
because i don't know in the flat earth

1748.96 --> 1753.2
debate i don't feel they really have

1750.88 --> 1755.279
disdain

1753.2 --> 1758.48
i think some of them just find me

1755.279 --> 1758.48
slightly disruptive

1759.84 --> 1764.08
because i can be but the thing is i

1762.32 --> 1766.72
always try to be disruptive with

1764.08 --> 1770.08
quality information i'm not just going

1766.72 --> 1770.08
to disrupt with nonsense

1776.72 --> 1780.0
yeah it's the archaico oh by the way

1779.279 --> 1781.76
thank you kevin

1780.0 --> 1783.279
horizons for the five pound super chat

1781.76 --> 1785.279
donation drink on me sir

1783.279 --> 1787.2
enjoy the chat thanks yeah thank you

1785.279 --> 1790.159
very much

1787.2 --> 1790.159
i appreciate that

1792.84 --> 1795.84
um

1796.48 --> 1801.039
you're not that late still got a half an

1798.799 --> 1801.039
hour

1801.6 --> 1804.8799999999999
right but yes your checkout self-hatred

1803.6 --> 1808.24
is not good

1804.88 --> 1812.72
i don't i have

1808.24 --> 1815.919
regrets i have shame

1812.72 --> 1819.679
tied in all that but i'm never

1815.919 --> 1822.3200000000002
letting that cause me to basically give

1819.679 --> 1825.1200000000001
up on myself and let it turn to hatred

1822.32 --> 1826.6399999999999
i'm never doing that ever again even

1825.12 --> 1829.52
though

1826.64 --> 1831.5200000000002
my subconscious may kind of push me even

1829.52 --> 1834.0
neurotically in that directions if i'm

1831.52 --> 1839.2
for example really overstressed

1834.0 --> 1839.2
i'm never letting that slide again

1840.96 --> 1843.2
so

1845.2 --> 1853.52
shame is so self-disturbing yes it is

1849.76 --> 1854.799
but it only really real shame only

1853.52 --> 1859.36
becomes destructive

1854.799 --> 1862.1589999999999
when you only look at the shame moment

1859.36 --> 1862.799
and you don't get practical with it and

1862.159 --> 1865.919
just

1862.799 --> 1867.679
see like okay did i learn from it am i

1865.919 --> 1869.6000000000001
gonna do anything like that again

1867.679 --> 1873.279
will i ever be fooled in anything or

1869.6 --> 1876.84
seduced in anything like that again

1873.279 --> 1880.24
and then i just realized that if you

1876.84 --> 1881.9189999999999
really really learn the lesson lesson of

1880.24 --> 1885.44
something you're

1881.919 --> 1889.919
like viscerally ashamed of

1885.44 --> 1892.96
then it's okay to let it go

1889.919 --> 1894.7990000000002
and it works it's not gonna come back

1892.96 --> 1895.6000000000001
like an elastic effect and slap you in

1894.799 --> 1897.9189999999999
the face

1895.6 --> 1898.799
that only happens when you try to push

1897.919 --> 1900.7990000000002
it away

1898.799 --> 1902.96
try to forget about it when you don't

1900.799 --> 1904.8799999999999
know what to do

1902.96 --> 1906.159
that's when it slaps you back in the

1904.88 --> 1910.48
face but when you

1906.159 --> 1914.0800000000002
actually address the cause

1910.48 --> 1917.1200000000001
of the effect then

1914.08 --> 1917.12
you can basically

1919.12 --> 1925.76
explain and justify that it is being

1923.12 --> 1928.7199999999998
resolved and then when you let it go

1925.76 --> 1930.24
it's actually it's not gonna slap you

1928.72 --> 1932.159
back in the face it's just gonna hang

1930.24 --> 1934.559
around there

1932.159 --> 1936.159
still being out there reminding you like

1934.559 --> 1938.24
yeah you can if you get

1936.159 --> 1940.96
reckless or careless you could make that

1938.24 --> 1940.96
mistake again

1941.279 --> 1949.84
but the tension is going to be off

1953.679 --> 1958.0800000000002
so that's my experience with that in

1960.84 --> 1963.84
general

1967.919 --> 1977.8400000000001
blue eternal

1988.84 --> 1991.84
right

1996.24 --> 2001.919
right so anyway where's amanda and robin

2000.08 --> 2003.4399999999998
well amanda usually gets in a little

2001.919 --> 2004.0800000000002
late because i don't know she's just

2003.44 --> 2006.559
very busy

2004.08 --> 2007.6789999999999
with work these days so she usually

2006.559 --> 2012.0
tends to pop in

2007.679 --> 2013.679
five minutes before the show ends as for

2012.0 --> 2015.279
robin stanley i haven't heard from her

2013.679 --> 2016.3990000000001
in a while i think she's just way too

2015.279 --> 2019.84
busy

2016.399 --> 2022.4799999999998
still you know moving like that

2019.84 --> 2024.1589999999999
in a in a complex situation it can take

2022.48 --> 2028.08
a long time to really

2024.159 --> 2030.159
get settled and then yeah

2028.08 --> 2032.1589999999999
she probably really needs to get settled

2030.159 --> 2035.8400000000001
before getting back to us again

2032.159 --> 2037.8400000000001
i don't mind you know she needs to take

2035.84 --> 2047.84
a time

2037.84 --> 2047.84
because moving can be quite impactful

2058.839 --> 2064.639
uh

2061.679 --> 2064.639
anyway uh

2070.079 --> 2089.8390000000004
right let's see

2074.24 --> 2089.839
what's going on out there

2100.839 --> 2103.839
hmm

2106.32 --> 2110.6400000000003
what oh my god

2110.8 --> 2118.4
corona masks for dogs really

2114.88 --> 2121.599
jesus oh

2118.4 --> 2121.599
i didn't want to know that

2127.119 --> 2132.4
so any any little details out there

2134.16 --> 2145.839
that i should know

2146.56 --> 2158.7999999999997
oh that's interesting iron fe i didn't

2148.56 --> 2161.52
know that

2158.8 --> 2163.599
right yeah that makes sense though that

2161.52 --> 2166.16
the thoughts would actually

2163.599 --> 2167.2000000000003
like pre-activate the muscles like get

2166.16 --> 2170.3999999999996
them warmed up

2167.2 --> 2173.1189999999997
in order to start moving fluid

2170.4 --> 2174.4
instead of just springing into action

2173.119 --> 2177.2000000000003
from a rested state

2174.4 --> 2177.2000000000003
that makes sense

2185.44 --> 2190.2400000000002
arthritics ooh more colored

2190.8 --> 2194.2400000000002
something natural for arthritic pain

2192.64 --> 2196.64
yeah it's a difficult one

2194.24 --> 2197.4399999999996
well what i immediately would say is

2196.64 --> 2201.839
tumeric

2197.44 --> 2201.839
it's it's the best

2203.119 --> 2210.079
and but yeah our arthritics is

2206.72 --> 2212.56
also like a chronic problem so you

2210.079 --> 2215.8390000000004
probably yeah it would be good to add

2212.56 --> 2215.839
some other things too

2220.0 --> 2224.4
you know because it is also i don't know

2222.079 --> 2226.6400000000003
it has to do with metabolics as well

2224.4 --> 2229.2000000000003
so it's very important you get all the

2226.64 --> 2233.2
fluoride out of your system

2229.2 --> 2237.52
like if you deprive your body from

2233.2 --> 2241.2
any poisonous influence also by the way

2237.52 --> 2243.28
milk i heard there is a connection that

2241.2 --> 2244.72
if you have arthritis and you like milk

2243.28 --> 2246.5600000000004
you kind of got a problem because it

2244.72 --> 2248.64
makes it worse now i'm talking about

2246.56 --> 2251.68
pasteurized milk and all that

2248.64 --> 2256.3199999999997
makes it worse uh

2251.68 --> 2258.96
so yeah take care to prevent

2256.32 --> 2261.839
your diet from aggravating it because it

2258.96 --> 2265.359
is an inflammation situation on the bone

2261.839 --> 2268.96
right so yeah get away from

2265.359 --> 2272.0789999999997
pasteurized milk and similar

2268.96 --> 2275.76
food products and

2272.079 --> 2277.76
tumeric i'd personally also get an

2275.76 --> 2279.76
iodine cure

2277.76 --> 2281.6800000000003
make sure that's in order it also kind

2279.76 --> 2284.88
of takes care of

2281.68 --> 2287.2
like remnant fluoride absorbing problems

2284.88 --> 2287.92
like any fluoride in your pineal gland

2287.2 --> 2290.96
will be it

2287.92 --> 2292.8
will be ejected because of that it would

2290.96 --> 2295.119
help your overall organs

2292.8 --> 2296.7200000000003
so yeah if you got your body in order

2295.119 --> 2297.2000000000003
then the arthritis will become a lot

2296.72 --> 2301.2799999999997
less

2297.2 --> 2303.839
and any direct symptoms the inflammation

2301.28 --> 2306.1600000000003
the joint problems most of it will

2303.839 --> 2309.599
probably be

2306.16 --> 2311.68
yeah properly suppressed gotten out of

2309.599 --> 2313.3590000000004
the way effectively

2311.68 --> 2315.44
not just that you don't feel it anymore

2313.359 --> 2318.48
but it will really kind of go away

2315.44 --> 2319.359
with turmeric but you got to have your

2318.48 --> 2321.359
body in

2319.359 --> 2323.119
yeah you know for all the right

2321.359 --> 2324.88
conditions

2323.119 --> 2326.6400000000003
for it to be truly lasting otherwise

2324.88 --> 2329.119
you're yeah you might

2326.64 --> 2330.56
just pile on the tumeric but if you

2329.119 --> 2331.6800000000003
still have the other influence it's

2330.56 --> 2334.7999999999997
still going to come back

2331.68 --> 2337.68
it's etc like that right and

2334.8 --> 2339.76
yeah it's not like a one-time thing also

2337.68 --> 2342.96
you know if you got

2339.76 --> 2345.44
arthritis you got basically have to keep

2342.96 --> 2349.28
taking the tumeric

2345.44 --> 2353.28
it it doesn't like permanently solve it

2349.28 --> 2356.8
because it is a chronic situation

2353.28 --> 2356.8
it always is unfortunately

2357.76 --> 2362.8
but you can get you can keep most of the

2360.8 --> 2366.32
symptoms off

2362.8 --> 2366.32
if you take really good care of your

2366.839 --> 2369.839
body

2379.92 --> 2385.28
eating cannabis sure cbd probably also

2384.24 --> 2388.7999999999997
will

2385.28 --> 2388.8
help a little extra

2390.48 --> 2394.96
but in the most direct sense it's it's

2392.56 --> 2399.7599999999998
tumeric it's really tumeric that's

2394.96 --> 2399.76
very very effective on that

2402.24 --> 2405.52
it's weird man if i'd know that if i had

2404.48 --> 2408.319
known that like

2405.52 --> 2410.319
30 years ago i would have given it to my

2408.319 --> 2413.44
grandmother she had arthritis and it

2410.319 --> 2413.44
it really bothered her

2413.52 --> 2417.44
would have been good if she had that we

2415.92 --> 2420.56
didn't know about it

2417.44 --> 2424.079
or i think maybe she did

2420.56 --> 2426.24
she didn't or i it's probably that

2424.079 --> 2428.079
i didn't pay attention to it i didn't

2426.24 --> 2429.52
care about people's food habits that

2428.079 --> 2432.88
much

2429.52 --> 2436.4
back then i was more interested in

2432.88 --> 2440.48
big ideas and space and

2436.4 --> 2442.0
blah religion and god and what is real

2440.48 --> 2445.28
and

2442.0 --> 2447.359
dreams not so much food

2445.28 --> 2449.2000000000003
i just wanted to shove all that candy in

2447.359 --> 2453.839
my mouth without worrying you know

2449.2 --> 2453.839
back then as i think a lot of kids do

2454.72 --> 2457.79
[Music]

2464.8 --> 2472.7200000000003
oh really insanity is sanity

2468.0 --> 2472.72
okay i don't know about that

2477.44 --> 2484.0
that doesn't ring a bell i mean mms

2481.92 --> 2485.839
miracle mineral supplement is really

2484.0 --> 2489.119
pretty astounding how it works

2485.839 --> 2492.839
and it will absolutely get situations

2489.119 --> 2494.88
away especially like inflammation

2492.839 --> 2498.0
situations

2494.88 --> 2498.8
but i don't yeah permanently i haven't

2498.0 --> 2501.28
heard that

2498.8 --> 2502.96
i don't know where you're getting that

2501.28 --> 2509.8390000000004
i've never heard anybody

2502.96 --> 2509.839
permanently getting rid of arthritis

2520.839 --> 2525.52
so

2523.2 --> 2525.52
right

2528.24 --> 2532.72
yeah i probably will be lucky enough not

2530.48 --> 2536.2400000000002
to get arthritis

2532.72 --> 2537.04
my net dad doesn't have it either i got

2536.24 --> 2539.52
a

2537.04 --> 2540.56
really good set of jeans from my dad

2539.52 --> 2543.839
when my mother had

2540.56 --> 2545.92
all kinds of problems

2543.839 --> 2548.0789999999997
i have some of those mainly the

2545.92 --> 2548.7200000000003
sensitivity but it seems like there's a

2548.079 --> 2552.2400000000002
lot of

2548.72 --> 2554.48
i don't know physical foundational gene

2552.24 --> 2556.0789999999997
situation from my dad that i got that's

2554.48 --> 2559.44
actually

2556.079 --> 2561.8390000000004
prevented me from

2559.44 --> 2564.7200000000003
basically going through the same things

2561.839 --> 2566.16
as my mother did physically now she also

2564.72 --> 2569.7599999999998
kind of aggravated that with

2566.16 --> 2571.839
all this doctor pharmaceutical [ __ ]

2569.76 --> 2575.44
that wouldn't help hey if i did that i

2571.839 --> 2575.44
would probably go the same way anyway

2576.839 --> 2583.2
but yeah i feel kind of lucky

2580.56 --> 2585.04
now my dad has his own physical problem

2583.2 --> 2585.5989999999997
everybody has physical problems and as

2585.04 --> 2588.96
you go

2585.599 --> 2592.0
grow older those typically become more

2588.96 --> 2595.76
emphasized but yeah those

2592.0 --> 2595.76
problems are not really that bad

2595.839 --> 2607.839
they're very mild uh yeah old age

2599.839 --> 2607.839
problems so i'll be all right

2614.24 --> 2618.16
manipulation helps a little to get some

2616.48 --> 2620.8
movement back

2618.16 --> 2622.7999999999997
well you got it tiny wumble the issue

2620.8 --> 2624.8
with arthritis is you gotta get the

2622.8 --> 2629.44
inflammation away

2624.8 --> 2632.5600000000004
you know because the worse that gets

2629.44 --> 2635.04
what is it yeah there it it there's like

2632.56 --> 2637.52
this weird sediment happening

2635.04 --> 2639.68
and that on the bone i think and that is

2637.52 --> 2641.28
really what then starts to irritate and

2639.68 --> 2649.839
cause the inflammation

2641.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
to get worse

2650.079 --> 2655.6800000000003
yeah once the issues are really there

2653.76 --> 2657.5200000000004
there's really nothing you can yeah

2655.68 --> 2659.44
manipulation is only going to make it

2657.52 --> 2661.92
worse

2659.44 --> 2664.079
most important thing is is that once you

2661.92 --> 2666.4
start to have traits of it

2664.079 --> 2668.5600000000004
you kind of really put effort into it

2666.4 --> 2669.359
that it that you don't get the sediment

2668.56 --> 2671.68
situation

2669.359 --> 2673.2
happening because after that it's going

2671.68 --> 2674.56
to be a lot worse and you won't be able

2673.2 --> 2676.24
to get rid of it really

2674.56 --> 2678.88
you will only just be able to get the

2676.24 --> 2682.7999999999997
inflammation away temporary or not

2678.88 --> 2682.8
bother you as much so

2683.839 --> 2691.839
at least that's what i learned about it

2697.92 --> 2705.839
my hair what the [ __ ]

2701.44 --> 2705.839
the heroine doesn't help anything

2712.88 --> 2719.52
like the only reason for something like

2716.839 --> 2721.839
that would be

2719.52 --> 2722.88
yeah under extreme traumatic wound

2721.839 --> 2725.04
situation

2722.88 --> 2727.44
like if you're literally just gonna die

2725.04 --> 2729.68
from stress of the pain and [ __ ]

2727.44 --> 2731.44
and you need to be calmed down in order

2729.68 --> 2732.319
to do the surgery right or something

2731.44 --> 2735.68
like that that's

2732.319 --> 2738.4
really the only reason

2735.68 --> 2740.56
to have something like that but as a

2738.4 --> 2743.6800000000003
symptomatic

2740.56 --> 2747.359
combatic thing combating drug

2743.68 --> 2748.319
yeah that's terrible because it has so

2747.359 --> 2752.56
many long-term

2748.319 --> 2752.56
side effects that it will start to build

2752.8 --> 2761.8390000000004
it's terrible

2777.52 --> 2783.92
it's all opioids i don't know what all

2780.72 --> 2787.1189999999997
is that but i'm not taking it

2783.92 --> 2789.28
you know i don't take pain medication i

2787.119 --> 2792.56
never do

2789.28 --> 2794.96
like ever since i stopped taking

2792.56 --> 2795.599
all forms of pain medication even in

2794.96 --> 2798.88
pretty

2795.599 --> 2802.56
bad circumstances it actually helped

2798.88 --> 2804.6400000000003
the pain to just last shorter

2802.56 --> 2807.44
that's my experience the more i got used

2804.64 --> 2811.68
to pain medication the longer the pain

2807.44 --> 2811.68
in such situations would actually last

2812.16 --> 2817.44
so i don't take it anymore and then the

2814.16 --> 2819.44
pain doesn't last as long

2817.44 --> 2822.64
i deal with it i think that even pain

2819.44 --> 2825.44
sometimes is kind of like a

2822.64 --> 2827.04
a thing that needs to happen for the

2825.44 --> 2829.119
psyche

2827.04 --> 2831.04
to be able to move on or something i

2829.119 --> 2832.4
don't know i think it really has this

2831.04 --> 2837.04
weird

2832.4 --> 2837.04
extra function that people overlook

2837.119 --> 2840.48
because they just got taught that pain

2840.0 --> 2842.48
should

2840.48 --> 2844.8
is something that you should only get

2842.48 --> 2848.8
rid of

2844.8 --> 2848.8
well it's obviously there for a good

2856.839 --> 2859.839
reason

2867.64 --> 2878.24
non-inflammation arthritis what

2872.319 --> 2878.24
how does that work does acupuncture help

2880.16 --> 2886.3999999999996
well acupuncture is basically like

2883.359 --> 2889.52
meridian energy

2886.4 --> 2892.0
stabilization so

2889.52 --> 2894.48
yeah it can help for all kinds of things

2892.0 --> 2898.4
but how that works

2894.48 --> 2900.72
it's not my expertise you know

2898.4 --> 2901.599
but i personally would classify it in

2900.72 --> 2904.3999999999996
the same

2901.599 --> 2906.0
category as kind of what i do is lay on

2904.4 --> 2909.92
hands healing

2906.0 --> 2909.92
is literally just yeah

2910.0 --> 2913.52
putting attention on my hand focusing

2912.24 --> 2915.5989999999997
with my mind

2913.52 --> 2917.839
putting my mind there and then literally

2915.599 --> 2919.92
just like a scanner feel what's going on

2917.839 --> 2923.52
i would do this on myself

2919.92 --> 2925.76
i can literally you know sometimes

2923.52 --> 2926.72
pain when you actually experience it

2925.76 --> 2928.559
yourself

2926.72 --> 2929.839
like for example in your leg or

2928.559 --> 2932.7200000000003
something then

2929.839 --> 2934.16
you experience that pain through the

2932.72 --> 2936.7999999999997
body and how it

2934.16 --> 2938.48
waves out and all that and it can be

2936.8 --> 2941.44
kind of like

2938.48 --> 2943.359
hard to figure out where it is because

2941.44 --> 2945.44
especially if it's like bad

2943.359 --> 2947.7599999999998
because where the actual pain is coming

2945.44 --> 2949.76
from might be even numb

2947.76 --> 2951.599
because of i don't know tensions or

2949.76 --> 2953.0400000000004
muscle on the nerve

2951.599 --> 2954.88
and then you feel the pain in other

2953.04 --> 2956.16
places yeah this kind of thing can

2954.88 --> 2959.599
happen

2956.16 --> 2962.64
but when i use this i can literally

2959.599 --> 2963.3590000000004
just scan it and then feel wait it's

2962.64 --> 2966.64
right here

2963.359 --> 2969.04
that's where the tension is and that

2966.64 --> 2971.52
works i can literally just take it out

2969.04 --> 2972.5589999999997
like absorb it then on my oh my whole

2971.52 --> 2974.64
arm will

2972.559 --> 2975.92
literally absorb that tension it damn

2974.64 --> 2979.04
well hurts

2975.92 --> 2979.04
okay it's literally like

2979.119 --> 2985.2000000000003
but there is no

2982.559 --> 2986.1600000000003
wound or anything it it settles on so it

2985.2 --> 2989.359
immediately

2986.16 --> 2991.1189999999997
basically just waves out into my arm and

2989.359 --> 2994.319
gets

2991.119 --> 2995.52
resolved by my bloodstream and by my

2994.319 --> 2999.44
system

2995.52 --> 3002.48
and then i shake it off

2999.44 --> 3006.64
also spreads the blood extra to

3002.48 --> 3010.839
get all the stuff out and attention

3006.64 --> 3013.359
it it just works it just

3010.839 --> 3016.5589999999997
works and i think that

3013.359 --> 3019.119
acupuncture probably in a very

3016.559 --> 3020.2400000000002
ancient refined mechanical way does the

3019.119 --> 3024.0
same thing

3020.24 --> 3027.359
but without like physical

3024.0 --> 3029.68
fleshly intervention it just kind of

3027.359 --> 3031.04
uses how the natural streams in the body

3029.68 --> 3035.2
works and then

3031.04 --> 3038.839
refinedly rearranges it

3035.2 --> 3040.8799999999997
something like that it's a very rough

3038.839 --> 3043.7599999999998
explanation

3040.88 --> 3045.52
sounds a little like reiki well reiki is

3043.76 --> 3049.119
different

3045.52 --> 3049.44
what i do what how i learned to call it

3049.119 --> 3053.6400000000003
is

3049.44 --> 3056.88
it's called magnetizing magnetization

3053.64 --> 3059.2
magnetization you actually use

3056.88 --> 3062.559
tension and then you absorb that's

3059.2 --> 3065.2799999999997
typically magnetization you take it out

3062.559 --> 3066.0
like a magnet you ship you take it out

3065.28 --> 3068.96
literally

3066.0 --> 3070.0
like it's physically gone in the in the

3068.96 --> 3071.839
body

3070.0 --> 3073.76
where you took it from even if it's

3071.839 --> 3076.0
another person it's just gone

3073.76 --> 3078.079
like really it's gone it's like you

3076.0 --> 3079.839
you're taking a chunk of tension out and

3078.079 --> 3081.599
it's gone

3079.839 --> 3084.0
but that's different than reiki because

3081.599 --> 3088.0
reiki is actually the opposite

3084.0 --> 3092.0
reiki does is you don't absorb it no no

3088.0 --> 3094.72
you actually completely

3092.0 --> 3095.599
relax and you do the opposite you kind

3094.72 --> 3099.4399999999996
of like

3095.599 --> 3102.6400000000003
take energy from the ether

3099.44 --> 3103.76
from god or yeah however you've learned

3102.64 --> 3106.0
to visualize that

3103.76 --> 3107.92
you make sure you don't take the energy

3106.0 --> 3110.88
literally from your own

3107.92 --> 3112.7200000000003
aura because then you're you'll drain

3110.88 --> 3114.96
yourself in the process

3112.72 --> 3116.0
you have to learn that and you then

3114.96 --> 3118.8
inject

3116.0 --> 3120.319
that energy almost like a sunbeam and it

3118.8 --> 3120.96
even kind of feels like that when you do

3120.319 --> 3124.079
that gets

3120.96 --> 3128.96
really hot and it is almost like the

3124.079 --> 3131.52
sun is locally then radiating that spot

3128.96 --> 3133.52
and yeah that has also like a healing

3131.52 --> 3136.96
effect

3133.52 --> 3140.319
but it's very different from magnetizing

3136.96 --> 3140.96
quite the opposite like from reiki you

3140.319 --> 3143.04
don't

3140.96 --> 3144.7200000000003
you don't get any tense muscles or

3143.04 --> 3146.4
anything from doing that

3144.72 --> 3148.16
although some people like if something

3146.4 --> 3150.559
goes wrong you can't typically get a

3148.16 --> 3151.68
headache

3150.559 --> 3154.0
i never get a headache from

3151.68 --> 3156.16
magnetization i just feel like i can't

3154.0 --> 3158.8
take anymore and then you just stop

3156.16 --> 3161.04
never gives me a headache never shoots

3158.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
to that location

3161.04 --> 3167.839
the tensions anyway

3187.599 --> 3191.839
all right now we'll get in sick look if

3189.52 --> 3194.88
the painting would be so extreme that

3191.839 --> 3197.2
it's literally almost making you

3194.88 --> 3198.559
faint yeah i get it that you'd probably

3197.2 --> 3202.0789999999997
just want to try

3198.559 --> 3205.2000000000003
to stop you know

3202.079 --> 3206.88
like if i'd had like super severe tooth

3205.2 --> 3211.4399999999996
ache pain

3206.88 --> 3211.44
yeah i will try to take something

3211.839 --> 3218.5589999999997
but it has to be pretty damn real

3214.88 --> 3220.559
pretty severe because i have regular jaw

3218.559 --> 3223.92
issues and sometimes it can be painful

3220.559 --> 3226.0
but i'm just going to ignore that

3223.92 --> 3227.079
as long as it's just in the way and it's

3226.0 --> 3230.079
not like

3227.079 --> 3233.92
paralyzingly

3230.079 --> 3237.6800000000003
yeah in your conscious and

3233.92 --> 3240.559
i don't know by training

3237.68 --> 3242.319
to just resist it it doesn't get as

3240.559 --> 3247.0400000000004
paralyzing anymore either

3242.319 --> 3247.04
so it also becomes easier to take

3248.64 --> 3265.839
don't broke your back [ __ ] that sucks

3267.359 --> 3272.88
hmm beasting therapy yeah that's

3270.64 --> 3276.72
interesting

3272.88 --> 3280.4
it that actually does something good

3276.72 --> 3280.3999999999996
although it's kind of sad for the bee

3291.2 --> 3295.52
yeah yeah right these things for

3293.2 --> 3298.5589999999997
arthritis i heard about that

3295.52 --> 3303.839
it's a bit unusual

3298.559 --> 3303.8390000000004
it's a very old feeling to it

3304.079 --> 3309.599
that sounds like a very ancient trick

3307.119 --> 3311.839
i don't know it might work i i never

3309.599 --> 3314.0
personally tried i don't have arthritis

3311.839 --> 3316.0
on the other hand i think that my mother

3314.0 --> 3319.2
actually did try that

3316.0 --> 3319.68
and she said that it did work except

3319.2 --> 3322.24
yeah

3319.68 --> 3324.0
freaking bee stings you know although

3322.24 --> 3327.4399999999996
there was also

3324.0 --> 3330.96
a cream basically with b

3327.44 --> 3332.799
poison that would do the same thing i

3330.96 --> 3335.599
think

3332.799 --> 3337.52
i don't know this is all a long time ago

3335.599 --> 3349.839
for me

3337.52 --> 3349.839
like at least 20 years ago

3360.839 --> 3363.839
so

3368.72 --> 3377.839
no wait twit let's not do that

3380.319 --> 3386.0
but you can try if you like i'm not

3383.52 --> 3386.0
going to

3410.319 --> 3414.24
sounds like today is a medical episode

3413.2 --> 3419.839
uh if i can

3414.24 --> 3419.839
dare to call it that

3430.839 --> 3433.839
hmm

3445.44 --> 3450.559
hmm interesting putting mud on bee

3448.319 --> 3453.599
stings

3450.559 --> 3460.1600000000003
well it's probably the

3453.599 --> 3463.28
the minerals in the mud that do it

3460.16 --> 3467.44
you know because

3463.28 --> 3469.8390000000004
it's like clay it has to be the right

3467.44 --> 3471.52
type of mud but clay is also like a

3469.839 --> 3474.5589999999997
poison absorbent

3471.52 --> 3477.28
did you know that

3474.559 --> 3478.2400000000002
just like a charcoal can be for certain

3477.28 --> 3481.8390000000004
type of

3478.24 --> 3485.2
toxic substances clay too

3481.839 --> 3488.0
and even like your body itself

3485.2 --> 3489.839
literally just uses those mineral type

3488.0 --> 3493.44
components to

3489.839 --> 3495.839
clean up the place so hey even if if you

3493.44 --> 3499.119
put it locally on there yeah sure

3495.839 --> 3501.599
i bet it would do something

3499.119 --> 3503.44
not necessarily like get the sting pain

3501.599 --> 3504.559
out or anything but it would probably

3503.44 --> 3508.4
soothe in

3504.559 --> 3510.559
the situation a little and hey

3508.4 --> 3513.28
mud baths are actually really healthy

3510.559 --> 3513.28
for your skin

3514.839 --> 3517.839
so

3529.839 --> 3533.839
oh by the way thank you for the for

3532.48 --> 3538.72
becoming a member of

3533.839 --> 3538.72
reggie bernanke awesome

3541.44 --> 3545.839
thank you for joining

3562.0 --> 3565.2
mud by nature

3565.44 --> 3570.799
well kevin horizons look again it really

3568.64 --> 3573.04
depends on the type

3570.799 --> 3576.24
if you're just gonna take mud from the

3573.04 --> 3578.799
wood from the woods

3576.24 --> 3581.04
and there's like earthly dirt in there

3578.799 --> 3583.68
then yeah there's also gonna be fungi

3581.04 --> 3585.2
and bacteria that are very necessary for

3583.68 --> 3589.2
the ground to

3585.2 --> 3591.1189999999997
to be alive and and viable for plants

3589.2 --> 3592.96
it might not always be good you know

3591.119 --> 3594.1600000000003
it's like open wounds dirt and open

3592.96 --> 3598.0
wounds can be

3594.16 --> 3601.04
tough but if it's like raw mud

3598.0 --> 3604.24
or clay like a specific

3601.04 --> 3607.119
patch of clay that you're literally just

3604.24 --> 3608.5589999999997
taking a chunk out of the out of the

3607.119 --> 3611.44
yeah out of the wall

3608.559 --> 3612.799
a wall of clay now that is that's not

3611.44 --> 3615.599
gonna be

3612.799 --> 3616.48
heavily infected or any did that's not

3615.599 --> 3618.799
really

3616.48 --> 3620.4
mushed up ground where all this stuff

3618.799 --> 3623.44
went through it like at most

3620.4 --> 3625.52
waters been through that so that's

3623.44 --> 3627.76
more likely to be clean unless like the

3625.52 --> 3629.44
ground has been like polluted with

3627.76 --> 3631.5200000000004
i don't know pesticides or some

3629.44 --> 3633.28
something else because that might

3631.52 --> 3635.359
typically still stick in there you got

3633.28 --> 3638.48
to realize it's very important

3635.359 --> 3640.0789999999997
to know how clean the ground is where

3638.48 --> 3642.72
you're going to be extracting

3640.079 --> 3644.4
mud clay from because it could be

3642.72 --> 3645.52
poisoned you got to be informed about

3644.4 --> 3647.28
this sort of thing

3645.52 --> 3651.68
don't just randomly start digging

3647.28 --> 3651.6800000000003
somewhere you got to know if it's clean

3651.92 --> 3661.52
but uh

3657.44 --> 3663.76
yeah clay on i don't know on wounds

3661.52 --> 3666.16
maybe if it's yeah if it's really open

3663.76 --> 3669.599
wound i wouldn't do that

3666.16 --> 3673.1189999999997
but maybe if it's like scrapey

3669.599 --> 3675.52
like a surface scratch i know yeah it

3673.119 --> 3678.0
might help

3675.52 --> 3680.24
but then again apparently there's also

3678.0 --> 3682.64
certain types of moss

3680.24 --> 3684.0
that you can put on there that also does

3682.64 --> 3686.4
the job so i hear

3684.0 --> 3687.2
so i've seen i don't know what kind of

3686.4 --> 3691.839
mosque i'm

3687.2 --> 3691.839
i'm not a moss healer most

3692.72 --> 3696.24
but yeah there's all kinds of things in

3695.2 --> 3698.16
nature that

3696.24 --> 3701.52
yeah if you know about it you can use it

3698.16 --> 3701.52
it actually works really well

3702.319 --> 3710.5589999999997
but you gotta really know how it works

3706.559 --> 3710.559
and there is research for this you know

3710.88 --> 3714.2400000000002
there's people that have written books

3713.04 --> 3716.88
about this

3714.24 --> 3718.24
even very long ago that are still out

3716.88 --> 3721.359
there

3718.24 --> 3721.359
you gotta know where to look

3722.0 --> 3726.16
right honey and open wounds that

3723.76 --> 3730.88
actually is really good if it's

3726.16 --> 3730.8799999999997
if it's real honey if it's pure

3731.039 --> 3738.1600000000003
yes honey are

3734.079 --> 3738.1600000000003
like amazingly disinfectant

3738.319 --> 3742.72
is amazingly disinfectant that's right

3745.92 --> 3750.96
all right but yeah finding honey in

3748.48 --> 3753.119
nature is not that easy

3750.96 --> 3754.48
compared to clay which is almost

3753.119 --> 3758.0
everywhere

3754.48 --> 3761.44
