88.4 --> 95.78
Only videos number three I just uploaded

92.03 --> 99.47
last night and some of you have already

95.78 --> 104.51
seen it I went up against Jackie it's

99.47 --> 107.119
just a hopeless individual but yeah this

104.51 --> 112.34
time I was focused on doing everything

107.119 --> 115.1
extremely calmly and I was very

112.34 --> 116.99000000000001
satisfied with the result and then ad

115.1 --> 119.33
kind of came in and ruined it with this

116.99 --> 122.99
troll of [ __ ] so I gotta cut it off stop

119.33 --> 127.369
the recording and afterward not on

122.99 --> 131.42
record started yeah doing that because

127.369 --> 134.05
nobody really needs that but him he's

131.42 --> 134.04999999999998
such an [ __ ]

135.58 --> 146.99
so yeah the weather today warm there's

144.68 --> 152.12
almost no wind the wind is extremely

146.99 --> 156.97
warm itself it's a little bit moist but

152.12 --> 156.97
it's especially just really really sunny

157.03 --> 160.93
and warm

166.52 --> 172.37
and yeah bugs everywhere they're all

170.52 --> 177.12
having a blast

172.37 --> 179.16
that's an interesting update for the

177.12 --> 180.78
birdies because I figured out now

179.16 --> 183.09
there's two there there's two little

180.78 --> 184.59
birds and one has grown quicker than the

183.09 --> 186.5
other and it was at first like worried

184.59 --> 189.06
like oh no they're not like gonna

186.5 --> 190.74
abandon lil one or something you know

189.06 --> 194.49
because that sometimes happens with some

190.74 --> 197.51000000000002
birds in nature but no there's both

194.49 --> 200.25
still there and the one is has his

197.51 --> 202.29
jackdaw voice and the other one still

200.25 --> 207.27
doesn't but they both get fed and they

202.29 --> 209.64
both kind of get yeah you can see for

207.27 --> 213.09
example this is what some birds can do

209.64 --> 216.14999999999998
when little birdies poo they have like

213.09 --> 218.04
this membrane around it and then the

216.15 --> 220.29
parent bird can basically pick that up

218.04 --> 223.59
in its beak without it bursting and

220.29 --> 226.92
carried it away and that only happens

223.59 --> 230.52
with the with the really little birds as

226.92 --> 233.7
far as I know and yeah that still goes

230.52 --> 235.82000000000002
on I basically spotted that third update

233.7 --> 238.85999999999999
indeed so it's interesting to see that

235.82 --> 244.10999999999999
that it keeps going you have them a

238.86 --> 249.08
fresh batch of energized water with a

244.11 --> 251.37
slight very small amount of pink

249.08 --> 255.27
Himalayan salt I put in there it's just

251.37 --> 257.01
just a sprinkle because it's good you

255.27 --> 259.10900000000004
know it's extra minerals of the right

257.01 --> 260.96999999999997
type it helps for the electrification it

259.109 --> 263.64
helps right I'm just giving them some

260.97 --> 265.52000000000004
magical water and they really appreciate

263.64 --> 269.01
that so the first thing that I saw was

265.52 --> 270.9
parent bird checking it out taking a sip

269.01 --> 273.28999999999996
and then just like it's feathers when

270.9 --> 277.44
all straight up and this was like okay

273.29 --> 281.09000000000003
big huge gulp it was like oh sitting

277.44 --> 285.15
there went straight up and then fed that

281.09 --> 289.4
you could hear you could hear like the

285.15 --> 293.72999999999996
the little one gulping it down so yeah

289.4 --> 297.2
it's just gives me a good feeling in my

293.73 --> 297.20000000000005
little birdie world here

297.61 --> 301.88
anyway I got Tamera coffee with me

300.2 --> 310.7
despite the white shirt I'm gonna be

301.88 --> 316.34
careful hmm green tea as usual and some

310.7 --> 318.17
orange juice just felt like it you had

316.34 --> 321.77
the taste of it mostly just mmm

318.17 --> 328.0
and some extra vitamin C but this hot

321.77 --> 328.0
weather you know huh it was on sale

332.39 --> 338.65
trained them bro brewed how to fly hmm

340.84 --> 344.14
well I'm certainly gonna pay attention

343.37 --> 347.48
to that

344.14 --> 349.87
you know I'm even surprised that their

347.48 --> 353.15000000000003
nest is holding up as well as it is

349.87 --> 356.57
because it is in the middle of a chimney

353.15 --> 359.03
so they really somehow got this a couple

356.57 --> 362.24
of branches crossover really stuck

359.03 --> 363.91999999999996
really well somehow because yeah if

362.24 --> 365.99
there's a little Jack doll in there

363.92 --> 368.3
probably hopping up and down if it's

365.99 --> 370.97
already got its voice it's got to be

368.3 --> 374.18
some sturdy [ __ ] to last for like a

370.97 --> 375.71000000000004
month or something like that because I

374.18 --> 377.12
thought at first that maybe it had

375.71 --> 379.96999999999997
dropped down there was so much activity

377.12 --> 382.97
going on but I think it was basically

379.97 --> 386.93
other young jackdaws that it already

382.97 --> 389.99
have left the nest that we're paying a

386.93 --> 392.36
visit like you know like older kids

389.99 --> 394.46000000000004
visit like oh yeah look you are gonna be

392.36 --> 395.93
big one day to to kind of encourage it

394.46 --> 404.18
that's really what that felt like

395.93 --> 406.24
in retrospect because there were like 10

404.18 --> 408.89
of them like flocking around that Jimmy

406.24 --> 418.19
look like what the hell was all going on

408.89 --> 422.28999999999996
there all cackling you know what Carter

418.19 --> 422.29
no birds are by the way

429.58 --> 438.10999999999996
okay anyway I'm gonna look through chat

432.76 --> 443.21
so mandiant was first Robin Stanley

438.11 --> 452.2
yabba / moco Sarita Cosentino alone eel

443.21 --> 452.2
Tom Parker rat Sabbath

458.279 --> 461.149
fine each

461.8 --> 482.41
Missouri bear good servant yeah I think

471.069 --> 484.0
I got you all right yeah so yeah there

482.41 --> 487.69
was no wolf leathers debate life

484.0 --> 491.65
yesterday for some reason it was told to

487.69 --> 496.24
me third hand that he was on a holiday

491.65 --> 499.23999999999995
or something I don't know if it's that's

496.24 --> 502.599
gonna continue today or not but we'll

499.24 --> 504.819
see but it was kind of a bummer for me

502.599 --> 507.28
because I'm really used to like getting

504.819 --> 511.86
very active at that moment socially and

507.28 --> 514.63
then suddenly there's only the chat yeah

511.86 --> 520.0500000000001
so I guess that that also fueled

514.63 --> 520.05
eventually me to to make the extra video

523.35 --> 527.9200000000001
cuz the ballers also get frustrated you

526.209 --> 530.5889999999999
know the ballers in the disk or chat

527.92 --> 533.9799999999999
that get on the discord panel they got

530.589 --> 538.2900000000001
frustrated when Nathan doesn't show up

533.98 --> 542.0500000000001
as expected to totally crush them and

538.29 --> 544.209
yeah and like verbally assaults them for

542.05 --> 546.579
their stupidity and ignorance and

544.209 --> 548.64
stubbornness like they need that and if

546.579 --> 551.079
it's suddenly gun they get off o

548.64 --> 555.8199999999999
hyperactive and [ __ ] it's that's real

551.079 --> 557.4399999999999
that that happens and you can hear it in

555.82 --> 561.5500000000001
the video that Chucky was kind of

557.44 --> 565.2600000000001
hyperactive like he was bored because he

561.55 --> 565.26
didn't get his daily lashing

570.05 --> 584.0999999999999
hmm no red priest 'hey i watch the

580.68 --> 589.17
little documentary series it seems to be

584.1 --> 592.2900000000001
played everyday like by chance on the

589.17 --> 594.15
dutch television it's concerning rivers

592.29 --> 598.3399999999999
it's like a nature documentary around

594.15 --> 605.01
rivers yes they was the amazon today was

598.34 --> 608.46
denial and poor yeah that type of thing

605.01 --> 611.09
it has great shots and it has just a lot

608.46 --> 615.48
of rich information in white fright

611.09 --> 618.39
variety of directions that's just really

615.48 --> 624.41
inspiring for somebody like me like it

618.39 --> 628.43
is fascinating how much is it yeah is

624.41 --> 630.81
affected by just a stream of water

628.43 --> 635.4599999999999
because of the layout of the land and

630.81 --> 643.26
everything like where the life settles

635.46 --> 646.5600000000001
in and just these different read parts

643.26 --> 648.5699999999999
of denial like it has like four very

646.56 --> 651.6199999999999
distinctly different parts that look

648.57 --> 657.12
completely different and art like it has

651.62 --> 659.37
even a big swamp area as well in between

657.12 --> 661.17
not like at the end or whatever i did

659.37 --> 663.71
that no it's like in between there's

661.17 --> 667.29
just a swamp like area that's very weird

663.71 --> 670.71
never fully realize that and that that

667.29 --> 673.92
was apparently originally a problem with

670.71 --> 676.5600000000001
attempt the earlier attempts to explore

673.92 --> 680.64
what the origin of the Nile was because

676.56 --> 687.14
that swampland is so wide nobody could

680.64 --> 687.14
get past it yeah anyway

689.0 --> 693.89
so I still got all those pictures in my

691.74 --> 693.89
head

707.67 --> 721.29
you're right what are you guys on to low

716.35 --> 721.2900000000001
hm leave me more

723.43 --> 727.3499999999999
that's a troll what whatever

760.36 --> 769.44
I think Amanda Young has been working a

763.3 --> 772.18
lot and then she earlier said in this

769.44 --> 772.6300000000001
time she feels like sleeping right after

772.18 --> 776.3499999999999
work

772.63 --> 779.92
so she's probably working at it really

776.35 --> 782.2900000000001
hard and then yeah you don't have time

779.92 --> 786.4799999999999
to pay attention to a lot of things on

782.29 --> 786.48
media world don't blame her

802.99 --> 814.509
but the Shoebill okay never heard of

807.05 --> 817.91
that you haven't you want to know what

814.509 --> 821.48
like the most annoying birds in the

817.91 --> 823.24
world are that are like fervent

821.48 --> 827.9590000000001
obsessive bullies

823.24 --> 831.41
it's the kookaburra I think it's in

827.959 --> 835.699
Australia it's a very weird bird and

831.41 --> 841.55
it's like it's sports the specifically

835.699 --> 844.0089999999999
poo on people's faces is sometimes when

841.55 --> 847.7589999999999
they get near humans that kind of day

844.009 --> 849.009
they like to lay traps just to [ __ ] with

847.759 --> 853.6990000000001
people

849.009 --> 865.939
kookaburra fascinated me as a kid when

853.699 --> 867.889
my brother told me about that they're

865.939 --> 871.9989999999999
like really annoying they're they're

867.889 --> 874.129
like Looney Tunes birds really like what

871.999 --> 876.529
Woody Woodpecker kind of supposed to be

874.129 --> 879.889
that's really a cook aboard that's how a

876.529 --> 880.48
kookaburra acts anybody ever heard of

879.889 --> 884.3290000000001
that

880.48 --> 887.889
let me see if I can find a picture it's

884.329 --> 887.8889999999999
not a really common bird I think

892.149 --> 895.149
kookaburra

895.749 --> 902.8000000000001
no that's cafe what the hell

908.0 --> 924.569
yeah Oh kookaburra they they're related

920.79 --> 941.009
to two birds that are a little bit more

924.569 --> 950.54
common although alright let me present

941.009 --> 950.54
that for a second right

953.36 --> 962.779
so yeah that's a kookaburra and then

958.49 --> 964.5790000000001
they are as cheeky as they look you can

962.779 --> 968.95
tame these creatures they make

964.579 --> 974.42
incredibly loud noises very unexpectedly

968.95 --> 977.2090000000001
and they sport [ __ ] people making

974.42 --> 979.7299999999999
yeah startling people and like [ __ ]

977.209 --> 983.2689999999999
on people's heads and stuff it's it's

979.73 --> 987.86
pretty bizarre but hilarious anyway

983.269 --> 988.7
that's a kookaburra I think they're from

987.86 --> 996.62
Australia

988.7 --> 999.73
I don't know how common they are what's

996.62 --> 999.73
that on a plane

1005.67 --> 1008.76
[Applause]

1010.609 --> 1020.669
it's a Cincinnati's you cool oh nice a

1018.359 --> 1023.9390000000001
live-action I've never even seen that

1020.669 --> 1026.01
I've only seen the pictures and heard

1023.939 --> 1028.019
the stories because it's a long time ago

1026.01 --> 1034.47
I kind of forgot about it until it just

1028.019 --> 1036.709
popped into my head yeah see how that

1034.47 --> 1036.709
sounds

1041.96 --> 1050.78
[Laughter]

1054.83 --> 1060.139
well that's that's gonna drive you nuts

1067.75 --> 1081.75
[Laughter]

1077.72 --> 1086.549
well I didn't expect it to be that

1081.75 --> 1090.299
freaky that well you can't get more

1086.549 --> 1094.1589999999999
Looney tune sounding than that sounds

1090.299 --> 1094.1589999999999
like I see a tenner for her head yeah

1099.169 --> 1109.8890000000001
he's just trying to your name it's a

1107.7 --> 1116.3600000000001
kind of a grappler bird isn't it

1109.889 --> 1116.36
Missouri bear what a weird creature

1125.49 --> 1130.44
like well from what I've seen not all

1128.55 --> 1134.3899999999999
kookaburras are nasty

1130.44 --> 1143.39
yeah there's apparently even tame ones

1134.39 --> 1143.39
huh weird

1152.32 --> 1157.0
it first like sounded almost like a

1155.139 --> 1160.99
monkey and then it kind of sounded like

1157.0 --> 1165.389
a hyena and then it's just like what the

1160.99 --> 1165.389
hell was going on so what is that

1180.97 --> 1185.28
and they can chop your finger off yeah

1186.24 --> 1198.28
I'll just look at the size of the beak

1190.95 --> 1203.95
as Owen and remember that part yeah

1198.28 --> 1206.289
limit and just just look at that look

1203.95 --> 1210.75
how big that is let me find a good

1206.289 --> 1210.75
moment just huge

1221.51 --> 1225.429
someone's like duck-sized beat

1233.45 --> 1236.32
anyway

1243.84 --> 1250.4089999999999
swallow a small fish in one go perhaps I

1247.679 --> 1256.3400000000001
don't know if it's a Fisher type of bird

1250.409 --> 1259.529
I think it probably uses its beak to I

1256.34 --> 1263.3999999999999
don't know to dig into fruit or nuts oh

1259.529 --> 1272.159
[ __ ] don't think it's a fishing bird but

1263.4 --> 1274.169
I don't know I would have to look it up

1272.159 --> 1276.2700000000002
and some fall in a book I don't know

1274.169 --> 1278.13
that much about a bird I just remembered

1276.27 --> 1288.059
the story that really stuck to be from

1278.13 --> 1290.0100000000002
when I was like 17 because I don't have

1288.059 --> 1292.83
like this wide memory that I can

1290.01 --> 1294.75
remember every dove distinctly every

1292.83 --> 1298.86
single bird I've ever seen there are so

1294.75 --> 1300.87
many it's just I don't my memory doesn't

1298.86 --> 1304.32
really work like that I can't like

1300.87 --> 1306.51
memorize a thousand things like in the

1304.32 --> 1309.26
same spectrum it's that it doesn't work

1306.51 --> 1309.26
for me like that

1314.65 --> 1318.4
hey you sleeping warrior

1324.059 --> 1328.039
oh god I knew it

1367.34 --> 1374.0
okay

1370.34 --> 1374.0
that's well oh really

1381.9 --> 1387.27
wait hm are you actually talking about

1384.39 --> 1390.15
the kookaburra now are you looking this

1387.27 --> 1394.1399999999999
up or something because I wasn't I kind

1390.15 --> 1396.0300000000002
of moved on interesting to know though

1394.14 --> 1400.76
that they're apparently also hunters

1396.03 --> 1404.7
then I guess it must be pretty quick

1400.76 --> 1407.79
like for a bird to catch a mouse you got

1404.7 --> 1410.28
to be extremely quick just look at well

1407.79 --> 1415.35
the the birds out there that do hunt for

1410.28 --> 1417.99
mice and all that they're like really

1415.35 --> 1420.27
rapid and [ __ ] so yeah that just goes to

1417.99 --> 1425.46
show that this weird silly kookaburra

1420.27 --> 1429.83
bird basically sounds ridiculous but

1425.46 --> 1434.75
it's potentially lethal and very quick

1429.83 --> 1440.58
they feed them mice in captivity Wow

1539.1 --> 1548.07
for my credit card to come in should

1541.32 --> 1550.739
arrive any day now then then I can

1548.07 --> 1556.9089999999999
finally get that fresh air system for

1550.739 --> 1562.6190000000001
for a good price that is Dede the Alexa

1556.909 --> 1565.279
Alexa pure thing right Alexa breeze

1562.619 --> 1565.279
that's the one

1583.84 --> 1591.1499999999999
oh you did nice yeah I hope I'm not

1588.52 --> 1595.42
gonna be too late

1591.15 --> 1598.93
might be a bit of a bummer if I have to

1595.42 --> 1601.0
wait like another week but it should

1598.93 --> 1603.76
like the credit card should come in like

1601.0 --> 1606.3
any day now I hope today perhaps

1603.76 --> 1606.3
tomorrow

1649.55 --> 1654.62
all right yeah drunken bullet for one

1651.65 --> 1659.93
now I do wear my white shirt sometimes

1654.62 --> 1667.01
especially when it's really hot because

1659.93 --> 1669.5
it feels better now stop akin traffic

1667.01 --> 1671.24
and my arrest I had with with me like I

1669.5 --> 1673.76
haven't bumped into that yet I have

1671.24 --> 1680.1200000000001
looked around but I couldn't even just

1673.76 --> 1681.86
find a bank they even so but it turned

1680.12 --> 1684.5
out that just getting a credit card

1681.86 --> 1687.4099999999999
directly tied into my bank system which

1684.5 --> 1690.58
is much more convenient so it turns out

1687.41 --> 1692.8400000000001
not to be that expensive after all

1690.58 --> 1694.55
because I'm not gonna spend giant

1692.84 --> 1698.24
amounts anyway and then it's not that

1694.55 --> 1700.3899999999999
bad so I'm just gonna do that

1698.24 --> 1704.41
it's gonna make things a lot easier and

1700.39 --> 1704.41
I should be able to manage that

1710.62 --> 1713.62
this

1724.039 --> 1735.259
hey that sounds familiar who's that Rob

1727.519 --> 1736.369
levels guy I remember you mentioned him

1735.259 --> 1742.22
in your videos

1736.369 --> 1746.299
Satan warrior oh I think it's I think

1742.22 --> 1748.45
it's time to remove some trolls lots of

1746.299 --> 1748.45
them

1753.98 --> 1760.22
yeah sorry sleeping worried about this

1756.13 --> 1762.529
there they're just being annoying you

1760.22 --> 1764.51
know you've already basically put out

1762.529 --> 1767.809
your entire case and this is all just

1764.51 --> 1771.11
padding gas lighting they're trying to

1767.809 --> 1773.12
gasp like whoever this supposedly as we

1771.11 --> 1775.6299999999999
all know who it is their track the gas

1773.12 --> 1775.6299999999999
light you

1786.14 --> 1789.429
[Music]

1792.5 --> 1796.53
[Music]

1793.559 --> 1799.42
and I find it kind of distracting

1796.53 --> 1801.58
because it's not a conversation that

1799.42 --> 1804.64
leads to any information for me to

1801.58 --> 1808.71
basically utilize so it's just a

1804.64 --> 1808.71
distraction for me for running my show

1809.1 --> 1818.35
now of course if you have some kind of

1811.36 --> 1820.3
update I'm always interested to hear

1818.35 --> 1822.99
about that in chat or if you want I

1820.3 --> 1822.99
could call you up

1828.679 --> 1841.89
from occult oh god you're gonna say it's

1833.64 --> 1842.8200000000002
a code it's a bit odd though to hear

1841.89 --> 1845.19
that from you

1842.82 --> 1849.1789999999999
you're probably trolling a little too

1845.19 --> 1855.8600000000001
because yeah the guy in question he does

1849.179 --> 1858.72
have a lot of fans and like even yeah

1855.86 --> 1861.8999999999999
that's like other people beside us that

1858.72 --> 1868.47
just don't feel like that about him now

1861.9 --> 1870.71
of course we know more about yeah we've

1868.47 --> 1874.77
experienced it more firsthand with him

1870.71 --> 1879.15
but yet that's not it's not just not

1874.77 --> 1882.87
gonna be enough so yeah all that's

1879.15 --> 1885.02
really left to do for you it's just yeah

1882.87 --> 1888.8999999999999
keep on doing what you set out to do and

1885.02 --> 1897.48
and don't don't try just try not to get

1888.9 --> 1902.3300000000002
gas lit by all these trolls because if

1897.48 --> 1904.8600000000001
you got your judicial framework in order

1902.33 --> 1906.6899999999998
then everything is just gonna work out

1904.86 --> 1911.1
doesn't really matter what anybody's

1906.69 --> 1914.549
going to say except yeah they could of

1911.1 --> 1917.82
course make it worse but you don't

1914.549 --> 1921.08
necessarily need that to happen in order

1917.82 --> 1925.61
to get things done right

1921.08 --> 1925.61
you're just petting your trolls okay

1929.72 --> 1936.39
yeah gendell

1931.44 --> 1940.25
I'm trying it is still happening though

1936.39 --> 1940.25
you know this is going on

1942.74 --> 1949.11
he has his show I have my show there's

1946.919 --> 1952.169
the Flat Earth debates and it happens

1949.11 --> 1954.6299999999999
and all the people that follow us they

1952.169 --> 1958.64
also follow him so it just has an

1954.63 --> 1958.64
influence it's gonna be brought up

1959.74 --> 1965.679
so yeah I brought it just had my

1963.46 --> 1972.059
insights on how to do with that properly

1965.679 --> 1972.0590000000002
I save it for court right Yendo

1977.62 --> 1980.6999999999998
[Music]

1987.17 --> 1993.14
a scared little painter scold hilarious

1990.95 --> 1993.92
rest and I don't exactly know what you

1993.14 --> 1996.5900000000001
mean by that

1993.92 --> 1997.3100000000002
where's the painters coming from oh of

1996.59 --> 2002.7099999999998
course

1997.31 --> 2004.78
oh my god that just sneaked in there I

2002.71 --> 2012.22
didn't even see it at first that you're

2004.78 --> 2014.11
hilarious I was thinking of globe

2012.22 --> 2016.65
painters but you meant another type of

2014.11 --> 2016.6499999999999
painters

2030.94 --> 2034.1090000000002
[Music]

2037.2 --> 2051.98
right uh bang-bang okay we're gonna have

2048.6 --> 2051.98
25 minutes ago

2064.909 --> 2069.859
what did I watch yesterday

2077.0 --> 2083.48
yeah I think it mostly just scrolled by

2079.399 --> 2105.52
lots of stuff I know I'm Benjamin as

2083.48 --> 2105.52
usual it's really warm in here

2110.74 --> 2115.72
see if I can get some air current going

2113.359 --> 2115.72
here

2125.84 --> 2137.2400000000002
are they easing up on the restrictions

2128.75 --> 2140.3
by you it seems so Tom Parker like

2137.24 --> 2142.91
officially it's the first of June when

2140.3 --> 2145.46
things are opening up here but there's

2142.91 --> 2149.0
already moves towards it and there are a

2145.46 --> 2154.13
lot of things open already so yeah

2149.0 --> 2157.01
everybody's sick of like the yet the

2154.13 --> 2159.35
lockdown and there's a lot and a lot of

2157.01 --> 2164.69
criticism articles like from all fronts

2159.35 --> 2169.3399999999997
all fronts medical just top down bottoms

2164.69 --> 2174.29
up people all kinds people that just

2169.34 --> 2178.4900000000002
like this is completely useless and it's

2174.29 --> 2183.44
a fraud and like even yeah but it's it's

2178.49 --> 2185.06
so overwhelmingly blatantly obvious at

2183.44 --> 2187.88
this point it's like it feels just

2185.06 --> 2191.72
complete waste of it feels superfluous

2187.88 --> 2195.23
for me to try to like say anything about

2191.72 --> 2198.0699999999997
it because it's all being said also and

2195.23 --> 2198.07
much further

2202.16 --> 2206.72
school are on line here okay

2208.859 --> 2216.5099999999998
Oh with some people that works great

2212.64 --> 2220.5
with others it really doesn't you know

2216.51 --> 2222.63
some kids need like physical attention

2220.5 --> 2226.829
they need somebody to be present

2222.63 --> 2236.9700000000003
physically to get like a yeah social

2226.829 --> 2239.27
chemistry going especially when they're

2236.97 --> 2239.27
really young

2248.01 --> 2252.15
now about lit with little kids it's

2250.109 --> 2256.92
always just about personal attention

2252.15 --> 2258.4500000000003
that's really what it's all about and

2256.92 --> 2262.109
then when they get older when they get

2258.45 --> 2265.97
self-conscious a lot and try to take

2262.109 --> 2265.97
responsibility try to develop that's

2266.06 --> 2271.77
when the need for personal attention

2268.32 --> 2274.619
drops down and it yeah and they can just

2271.77 --> 2278.7
start to focus more and then I guess

2274.619 --> 2281.25
yeah when your teenager online schools

2278.7 --> 2285.98
what could potentially be better but as

2281.25 --> 2285.98
little kids it isn't it's really not

2290.75 --> 2302.04
it's time trafficking my rest dad yeah

2293.34 --> 2306.3
yeah well it's it's weird man if I could

2302.04 --> 2309.93
drive by graduation okay miss Very Berry

2306.3 --> 2312.21
a drive by graduation it's all about the

2309.93 --> 2314.1299999999997
the graduation process you know when you

2312.21 --> 2317.34
go to university or school or whatever

2314.13 --> 2322.26
you're signed in for a year and then

2317.34 --> 2325.53
eventually like you graduate based on on

2322.26 --> 2328.05
the curriculum you had all right but if

2325.53 --> 2331.2000000000003
you do a home schooling you don't have

2328.05 --> 2334.6800000000003
to go to school you just got to show up

2331.2 --> 2339.5099999999998
for for graduation for the exams and all

2334.68 --> 2342.2999999999997
that and then do that officially that's

2339.51 --> 2345.51
it so you could call that a drive-by

2342.3 --> 2346.92
graduation unless you mean that there

2345.51 --> 2349.7700000000004
wouldn't be any tests that our people

2346.92 --> 2352.7400000000002
would just get the diploma on some other

2349.77 --> 2355.38
condition that would be a fraud by the

2352.74 --> 2356.0899999999997
way but is that what you're talking

2355.38 --> 2360.59
about

2356.09 --> 2360.59
Missouri bear I have no idea

2367.78 --> 2375.3700000000003
how do you buy subs well yeah I don't

2372.52 --> 2378.19
know you contact Google I think they'll

2375.37 --> 2382.99
be glad to provide you extra support or

2378.19 --> 2385.06
extra connections if you pay them but

2382.99 --> 2393.6699999999996
instead really what you want do you have

2385.06 --> 2396.34
money for that I don't I'd rather just

2393.67 --> 2400.12
collect real viewers real watches real

2396.34 --> 2408.13
people that I can slowly but gradually

2400.12 --> 2410.43
get to know and then just have Giant

2408.13 --> 2410.4300000000003
Steps

2426.89 --> 2432.14
alright Jane Doe yeah sure there are

2429.11 --> 2437.0
other websites as well but I'm not

2432.14 --> 2440.0899999999997
interested I'm really not like for

2437.0 --> 2441.92
especially for this you know look who

2440.09 --> 2443.59
knows maybe in the future somewhere

2441.92 --> 2447.38
there will be more like a business

2443.59 --> 2449.8700000000003
oriented escapade you know who knows I

2447.38 --> 2452.12
might be at some point just like be a

2449.87 --> 2453.95
representative on the video even I have

2452.12 --> 2456.2599999999998
the skills you know but I wouldn't be

2453.95 --> 2459.08
like our win I would be probably wearing

2456.26 --> 2461.1800000000003
a suit or something and that could

2459.08 --> 2463.34
happen at some point I don't know if it

2461.18 --> 2464.6299999999997
will I'm not necessarily looking forward

2463.34 --> 2467.9
to doing that but it might happen at

2464.63 --> 2470.84
some point and then I might have another

2467.9 --> 2473.29
channel not our win and be like your

2470.84 --> 2476.81
business represented and then yeah

2473.29 --> 2478.82
depending on what the project is buying

2476.81 --> 2483.71
subs especially for an advertisement

2478.82 --> 2486.4
project is logical do you need the

2483.71 --> 2489.77
spread that's what it's all about

2486.4 --> 2491.6600000000003
doesn't really matter if you get a lot

2489.77 --> 2493.67
of following because it's not about that

2491.66 --> 2497.12
it's about getting seen by everyone and

2493.67 --> 2498.23
everything so yeah that good happen but

2497.12 --> 2501.8199999999997
I'm not going to do that for this

2498.23 --> 2506.65
channel because that would be cheating

2501.82 --> 2506.65
no that's not how I want to do this

2515.79 --> 2530.08
what stuff a traffic of arrests that

2518.43 --> 2537.5099999999998
well I do but you're purchasing loyalty

2530.08 --> 2540.25
huh Wow

2537.51 --> 2544.2700000000004
really misery so you think that when you

2540.25 --> 2546.85
buy subs you literally by people that

2544.27 --> 2549.1
fake follow you and fake um and that

2546.85 --> 2551.23
literally spend time in their day to act

2549.1 --> 2554.29
like they care about your work and

2551.23 --> 2557.2
follow you I don't think that that is

2554.29 --> 2559.3
real that's absurd

2557.2 --> 2565.8399999999997
that would be so visible that it's fake

2559.3 --> 2568.53
I don't think yeah that I know it would

2565.84 --> 2571.33
be more logical to then just have BOTS

2568.53 --> 2573.82
just have one guy or something just

2571.33 --> 2575.62
figure it out and then make BOTS that

2573.82 --> 2578.0800000000004
spam messages that would correlate I

2575.62 --> 2579.97
think that's not going to be like a lot

2578.08 --> 2583.45
of people like hundreds of people that

2579.97 --> 2585.3399999999997
are like yeah I have a computer in a lot

2583.45 --> 2586.93
of time two ways that would then act

2585.34 --> 2591.58
like they are following you I don't

2586.93 --> 2594.3599999999997
think it works like that I think it's

2591.58 --> 2599.85
just tricking with stats mostly a douche

2594.36 --> 2599.85
okay why are you saying that

2608.52 --> 2613.47
all righty cabbie well that is that is

2610.92 --> 2616.77
the most logical just the increase of

2613.47 --> 2621.5699999999997
the stats but who knows maybe there are

2616.77 --> 2624.33
like like fake follower group type of

2621.57 --> 2626.61
subsystems out there probably would cost

2624.33 --> 2628.5
a little more like yeah we got like ten

2626.61 --> 2632.28
people and they can pretend to be like a

2628.5 --> 2634.77
thousand and then it would really seem

2632.28 --> 2636.57
crowded ever maybe that does exist but

2634.77 --> 2641.13
it probably is not going to be super

2636.57 --> 2644.8500000000004
cheap I don't know man I don't know what

2641.13 --> 2646.619
this world is really like out there when

2644.85 --> 2649.5899999999997
the money starts flowing or how it would

2646.619 --> 2666.6600000000003
how it would appear to look like I don't

2649.59 --> 2668.6400000000003
know I think eventually if if the money

2666.66 --> 2672.6299999999997
numbers are high enough anything could

2668.64 --> 2679.77
be achieved including that kind of silly

2672.63 --> 2684.69
setups no but yeah must be really

2679.77 --> 2687.47
important then it's worth wasting so

2684.69 --> 2687.4700000000003
much money on that

2704.16 --> 2710.3399999999997
what are you talking about sleeping

2706.65 --> 2719.61
warrior how many like says he have life

2710.34 --> 2727.52
is it is videos let me check him out 3.1

2719.61 --> 2727.52
K that's not like spy ways that's fuse

2734.32 --> 2742.1400000000003
a hundred and eighty four what's so

2737.2 --> 2742.14
special about that it's not that many

2742.5 --> 2747.61
just means that the subject is very

2745.66 --> 2749.71
polarizing and that there's a lot of

2747.61 --> 2752.17
people agreeing and there's also a lot

2749.71 --> 2754.6
of down votes by the way so it's just a

2752.17 --> 2756.1
very attention to wrong polarizing

2754.6 --> 2760.96
subject apparently that's weighing

2756.1 --> 2765.19
heavily on a lot of people so that

2760.96 --> 2767.32
doesn't mean that sleeping warrior has

2765.19 --> 2772.15
certainly bought subs or something or

2767.32 --> 2775.21
votes no just means that what he's just

2772.15 --> 2776.83
put forth a very polarizing video and

2775.21 --> 2779.61
that's drawing a lot of attention that's

2776.83 --> 2779.61
just what it is

2794.76 --> 2802.2400000000002
yeah yeah I uploaded that video even

2799.119 --> 2805.0
though yeah I wouldn't personally never

2802.24 --> 2810.0099999999998
put out a video like that but it's you

2805.0 --> 2821.19
and I know what you're trying to do and

2810.01 --> 2821.19
I support you as a friend he's a malsky

2824.88 --> 2829.71
thank you now that's ridiculous Jane Doe

2831.45 --> 2840.1
why why look if somebody is buying subs

2835.99 --> 2842.56
and you just share that with your public

2840.1 --> 2847.2
it's like yeah it seems like we I have a

2842.56 --> 2851.2599999999998
lot of views now right guys well I

2847.2 --> 2854.3199999999997
bought subs right you could just say

2851.26 --> 2856.63
that like I did that and I did it to try

2854.32 --> 2859.27
to reach this level or something and

2856.63 --> 2861.04
just roll it out as like yeah it's like

2859.27 --> 2863.71
a business investment for the channel

2861.04 --> 2865.21
and then what's wrong with that doesn't

2863.71 --> 2866.56
have to be wrong as long as you're

2865.21 --> 2869.38
always going to be honest about it and

2866.56 --> 2871.66
not gonna be like oh or have more subs

2869.38 --> 2873.4
than you trying to show off with it

2871.66 --> 2875.5299999999997
because then it would just be ridiculous

2873.4 --> 2878.28
because you bought some of them you know

2875.53 --> 2880.9900000000002
so as long as you're just being honest

2878.28 --> 2883.8100000000004
buying subs hey if you're doing it for

2880.99 --> 2886.4799999999996
some kind of business investment then I

2883.81 --> 2888.2799999999997
don't see a direct problem within as

2886.48 --> 2891.19
long as you're just being honest about

2888.28 --> 2894.03
it but I don't think that the case will

2891.19 --> 2894.03
be more you're here

2896.58 --> 2899.71
[Music]

2903.36 --> 2908.09
[Music]

2917.98 --> 2933.68
it harass that I'm having a bit trouble

2926.45 --> 2936.5
figuring out what you're onto subject

2933.68 --> 2938.8689999999997
focal point plaintiff it's a real

2936.5 --> 2942.369
sausage fest build up around that I who

2938.869 --> 2942.369
is plaintiff I don't know who that is

2952.62 --> 2960.3599999999997
Oh Jane Doe right Simon then right yeah

2956.58 --> 2962.1
but that yeah I remember that when he

2960.36 --> 2966.63
came onto the scene he just had this

2962.1 --> 2969.99
mighty boost measuredly was all all laid

2966.63 --> 2972.51
out as a subject back then and he should

2969.99 --> 2975.4199999999996
be honest about it but yet he absolutely

2972.51 --> 2977.7900000000004
tries to use his weight of the supposed

2975.42 --> 2981.26
amount of subscriptions to try to bully

2977.79 --> 2981.2599999999998
people that's right

2988.759 --> 2994.099
okay rust I had righty dokey

3005.08 --> 3009.5699999999997
I still don't know who plaintiff is by

3007.36 --> 3009.57
the way

3050.04 --> 3052.79
hmm

3053.549 --> 3059.7889999999998
I don't know did sleeping or he said I

3056.63 --> 3063.739
think he asked I think he was

3059.789 --> 3063.739
considering it I don't think he has

3064.819 --> 3071.849
liked and if he did he didn't buy a lot

3068.089 --> 3075.269
you know usually when Pro when sub

3071.849 --> 3078.3590000000004
buying programs are initiated you get

3075.269 --> 3081.419
like an incremental linear step-up

3078.359 --> 3083.669
amount it you don't just get splat ten

3081.419 --> 3088.3799999999997
thousand subs now it just builds up but

3083.669 --> 3089.459
quickly suddenly rapidly and that then I

3088.38 --> 3092.7290000000003
died

3089.459 --> 3094.6789999999996
that hasn't happened you know usually

3092.729 --> 3099.089
when somebody buys up you don't have to

3094.679 --> 3107.2690000000002
ask you just look at the stats it's very

3099.089 --> 3107.269
obvious when it's happened okay

3108.65 --> 3111.55
that's fine

3113.52 --> 3118.74
okay good to know sleeping warrior aye I

3116.1 --> 3120.69
was just wondering because it was a

3118.74 --> 3122.2799999999997
little unclear to me why that was

3120.69 --> 3126.42
brought up about buying subs and all

3122.28 --> 3128.52
that but hey look if you did that and

3126.42 --> 3129.9
you just was on we're honest about it

3128.52 --> 3135.06
and you did it for a very specific

3129.9 --> 3137.19
purpose then I wouldn't even mind you

3135.06 --> 3138.75
know as I explained before as long as

3137.19 --> 3141.33
you're just being honest you're doing it

3138.75 --> 3143.88
and you're not going to try yeah once

3141.33 --> 3146.58
you do that you can't really try to

3143.88 --> 3148.32
outweigh people socially with bragging

3146.58 --> 3149.85
with the amount of subs you have because

3148.32 --> 3156.42
if you do that then you're just an idiot

3149.85 --> 3160.47
you're an a liar read my last comment

3156.42 --> 3165.619
what Roxanne's case is like an Indian

3160.47 --> 3165.6189999999997
dance club a ton of duo guards

3168.43 --> 3173.37
I

3168.79 --> 3173.37
[Laughter]

3189.53 --> 3196.4100000000003
yeah I think I get where you're going

3191.91 --> 3204.12
with this it does seem like there's a

3196.41 --> 3207.39
lot of yeah it's basically a white night

3204.12 --> 3210.95
situation that certainly has turned into

3207.39 --> 3218.7
a politicized polarized grouping

3210.95 --> 3222.4399999999996
situation I'm not seeing a lot of women

3218.7 --> 3222.4399999999996
basically even talking about this

3228.75 --> 3234.48
alright supplicant traffic I'm arrested

3231.06 --> 3238.04
well it is spring time you know so it's

3234.48 --> 3238.04
not surprising that this is happening

3243.99 --> 3249.959
[Music]

3250.94 --> 3263.19
woman should a Missouri bear now that's

3262.17 --> 3273.41

well for that I would kind of like a

3330.29 --> 3338.07
subject than to dig into it because I

3333.83 --> 3340.41
know there hasn't been any specific new

3338.07 --> 3344.34
subject that came up recently it's just
