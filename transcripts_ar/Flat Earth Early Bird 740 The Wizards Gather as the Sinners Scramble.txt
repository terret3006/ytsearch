metal

80.88 --> 85.67999999999999
some money together from well from my

83.84 --> 89.52000000000001
supporters here from you guys all

85.68 --> 94.0
especially for some equipment

89.52 --> 96.79899999999999
and yesterday i bought another thing

94.0 --> 98.799
tried to make it cheap but yeah i i

96.799 --> 100.799
needed a new pair of headphones because

98.799 --> 105.119
the old one

100.799 --> 107.119
was very old

105.119 --> 108.32
and yeah kind of even as i bought it

107.119 --> 110.24
pretty shitty

108.32 --> 112.24
it's like a headphone one of the foams

110.24 --> 114.079
is missing the other one's broken

112.24 --> 115.759
and yeah these things are like super

114.079 --> 118.479
cheap ass they're like

115.759 --> 119.43900000000001
five euros and they're pretty damn

118.479 --> 122.799
decent for

119.439 --> 124.55999999999999
five euros right but i really wanted a

122.799 --> 126.56
good set of headphones

124.56 --> 129.2
because i kind of need them so that i

126.56 --> 134.239
can still

129.2 --> 137.51999999999998
listen music and such and other things

134.239 --> 140.8
like late at night without waking up

137.52 --> 143.76000000000002
my roommates in the process because i do

140.8 --> 144.959
sometimes stay up really late and i

143.76 --> 146.959
didn't want to

144.959 --> 148.879
bother them especially now that the

146.959 --> 149.92000000000002
atmosphere is a little bit more tense

148.879 --> 153.51899999999998
than before since

149.92 --> 154.55999999999997
my landlord started getting all worked

153.519 --> 158.0
up and

154.56 --> 161.12
riding gossipy slandering letters

158.0 --> 163.04
again that's just [ __ ] it's uh

161.12 --> 164.16
right so i bought a new pair of

163.04 --> 166.879
headphones

164.16 --> 167.599
pretty decent when i thought over the

166.879 --> 172.0
internet

167.599 --> 175.76
it should arrive tomorrow for 36

172.0 --> 177.76
euros so

175.76 --> 180.48
right i thought i could still afford

177.76 --> 183.519
that also went to the computer store

180.48 --> 186.72
another one that had second hand

183.519 --> 188.72
things was like this guy and

186.72 --> 189.84
i think like his store is probably very

188.72 --> 192.959
similar to that of

189.84 --> 194.959
geo shifters like he's it was like a geo

192.959 --> 197.68
shifter guy but in my city

194.959 --> 199.28
pretty awesome and i even asked like oh

197.68 --> 202.959
do you have one of these old

199.28 --> 205.519
dell keyboards from the 90s it's like

202.959 --> 206.72
oh one of those right right with the two

205.519 --> 209.04
different colored

206.72 --> 210.64
keys right that kind of looks like an

209.04 --> 213.67999999999998
amiga 1200

210.64 --> 217.11999999999998
yeah yeah well not right now but if

213.68 --> 220.4
if i find one i'll call you

217.12 --> 224.159
that was awesome so yeah

220.4 --> 226.08
found a really cool computer store

224.159 --> 228.64
yeah landlords can be awful i know yeah

226.08 --> 232.31900000000002
this one is just

228.64 --> 234.879
he's an is it a decent guy

232.319 --> 237.04
until suddenly and it typically happens

234.879 --> 240.39999999999998
in this period of the year

237.04 --> 241.84
he i don't know man i don't know exactly

240.4 --> 244.72
how it happens

241.84 --> 245.12
i think he might be the tensions run

244.72 --> 250.239
high

245.12 --> 250.239
at home with his gay husband

250.56 --> 254.56
and then he just started starts to freak

252.64 --> 257.759
out and starts to just

254.56 --> 259.759
like have this blaming gossipy mode

257.759 --> 260.88
and it just projects it onto whatever's

259.759 --> 262.639
at hand

260.88 --> 264.4
and with me that results that he's

262.639 --> 266.96000000000004
literally just

264.4 --> 268.56
messaging slandering letters to my dad

266.96 --> 270.79999999999995
like oh my god your son's gone

268.56 --> 273.52
completely insane again he oh he needs

270.8 --> 276.56
mental help right now because people

273.52 --> 278.32
like everybody's in danger like total

276.56 --> 281.28000000000003
[ __ ] up madness

278.32 --> 284.96
madness and i told him like stop sending

281.28 --> 287.52
these freaking gossip letters to my dad

284.96 --> 289.19899999999996
he doesn't like that and he knows me and

287.52 --> 293.28
he knows that's [ __ ]

289.199 --> 295.68
stop it right now and he's just like

293.28 --> 296.88
don't let me hear another complaint

295.68 --> 300.16
again

296.88 --> 301.84
like whatever man

300.16 --> 303.91900000000004
you're not even getting any complaints

301.84 --> 306.32
from me from anybody else because i'm

303.919 --> 306.96
extremely well behaved and communicative

306.32 --> 309.59999999999997
with

306.96 --> 311.12
my roommates i don't even think he even

309.6 --> 313.03900000000004
got to complain about me he got a

311.12 --> 314.24
complaint about somebody else and then

313.039 --> 316.24
he proceeded to

314.24 --> 318.479
literally just start targeting me out of

316.24 --> 320.24
nowhere because nobody did make a

318.479 --> 323.039
complaint about me it's absolutely

320.24 --> 323.039
preposterous

323.36 --> 327.52000000000004
yeah but as long as i just ignore it he

326.24 --> 330.32
leaves me alone

327.52 --> 330.639
as he should because he thinks that he

330.32 --> 333.59999999999997
can

330.639 --> 334.16
bully me out of his room he can't

333.6 --> 336.24
there's

334.16 --> 339.28000000000003
nothing he can do if i want i can live

336.24 --> 341.84000000000003
here the rest of my [ __ ] life

339.28 --> 342.479
there's nothing he can do absolutely

341.84 --> 345.52
nothing

342.479 --> 346.71999999999997
zero criminal record barely any

345.52 --> 349.919
complaints

346.72 --> 352.24
i'm super helpful i literally clean up

349.919 --> 354.639
the mess of other roommates

352.24 --> 356.96000000000004
because they are just regular people

354.639 --> 359.759
that leave [ __ ] behind i clean

356.96 --> 360.63899999999995
that [ __ ] sometimes right so there's

359.759 --> 364.0
absolutely

360.639 --> 366.639
nothing he can do and he knows it

364.0 --> 367.199
so he just starts to write slandering

366.639 --> 370.40000000000003
letters

367.199 --> 371.52000000000004
to my dad it's completely madness i know

370.4 --> 374.0
my rights indeed i

371.52 --> 376.15999999999997
even went to a lawyer about it and he

374.0 --> 378.319
confirmed like yeah that's all very cute

376.16 --> 379.68
there's absolutely nothing he can do

378.319 --> 382.40000000000003
like you have like

379.68 --> 383.28000000000003
it's almost unreasonable almost

382.4 --> 386.4
unreasonable

383.28 --> 389.75899999999996
how much [ __ ] you have to pull as

386.4 --> 390.63899999999995
as an occupant for a landlord to have

389.759 --> 393.28000000000003
you evicted

390.639 --> 394.16
it's almost unreasonable how bad it has

393.28 --> 398.88
to get

394.16 --> 401.84000000000003
before that can happen and i am zero

398.88 --> 403.039
total clean record like the worst thing

401.84 --> 405.84
that comes out of me

403.039 --> 407.12
is that that i've been very like pissed

405.84 --> 410.56
off and loud and yelly

407.12 --> 413.759
sometimes never violence not a

410.56 --> 415.36
single fragment or example of physical

413.759 --> 418.47900000000004
violence ever

415.36 --> 421.039
only just yelling sometimes and

418.479 --> 422.31899999999996
people complain about it i immediately

421.039 --> 425.44
stop it immediately

422.319 --> 427.84000000000003
never get shut up go away no

425.44 --> 429.039
no no immediately like oh i'm sorry i'm

427.84 --> 431.44
sorry i didn't know

429.039 --> 432.24
you were there or something always every

431.44 --> 435.68
single time

432.24 --> 438.72
he has nothing to stand on nothing

435.68 --> 440.319
it's hilarious in a way but it's also

438.72 --> 441.84000000000003
freaking annoying every time he starts

440.319 --> 444.319
doing that again and it's

441.84 --> 446.15999999999997
now pretty much every year that that

444.319 --> 449.12
happened so it's like ah

446.16 --> 450.319
okay he's gone into squirting mode again

449.12 --> 452.24
he's all

450.319 --> 453.36
riled up probably in a fight with his

452.24 --> 456.639
gay

453.36 --> 459.759
husband and all that [ __ ] whatever

456.639 --> 462.40000000000003
i don't really care anymore

459.759 --> 465.84000000000003
right so i didn't really want to talk

462.4 --> 465.84
about that

466.8 --> 471.28000000000003
and that that was like a week ago now by

469.759 --> 471.68
the way so i haven't heard from him in a

471.28 --> 473.919
while

471.68 --> 475.84000000000003
it was exact it was like the day after

473.919 --> 477.75899999999996
the shower situation when the shower

475.84 --> 479.599
broke i fixed it and the day after you

477.759 --> 482.639
started writing those letters like

479.599 --> 485.68
the worst timing imaginable

482.639 --> 487.28000000000003
the guy is not really all there

485.68 --> 489.52
is funnily enough he even kind of

487.28 --> 491.44
admitted it to my face

489.52 --> 493.75899999999996
like yeah i get it worked up but he

491.44 --> 498.0
doesn't draw the conclusion like oh

493.759 --> 501.199
so this guy gets me like really gets me

498.0 --> 503.68
maybe i should stop abusing him with

501.199 --> 504.56
slander nonsense whenever i go over the

503.68 --> 506.319
top

504.56 --> 507.599
no he doesn't draw that conclusion even

506.319 --> 511.68
though he's like

507.599 --> 511.68
60 or something it's very weird

513.599 --> 519.0390000000001
right hey jim west yes it's cold here

516.24 --> 522.9590000000001
not super cold but cold enough

519.039 --> 525.919
right it's the weather

522.959 --> 525.919
it's kind of nice

528.32 --> 533.279
it's like a cloud bank with some room in

531.76 --> 537.519
between

533.279 --> 541.2
not a lot of blue not a lot of sun

537.519 --> 543.92
it's like a nice dry windless

541.2 --> 543.9200000000001
winter day

545.36 --> 549.04
and it's dry especially that part is

547.519 --> 552.08
kind of

549.04 --> 555.76
kind of happy about that oh oh

552.08 --> 559.519
oh i had an amazing experience yesterday

555.76 --> 563.12
amazing one of a kind

559.519 --> 566.9590000000001
and i've is really amazing

563.12 --> 571.68
guys yesterday i had a

566.959 --> 574.3199999999999
very very extensive wizards council

571.68 --> 576.7199999999999
skype call with a couple of very

574.32 --> 579.839
important people

576.72 --> 581.9200000000001
basically and colleagues like nathan

579.839 --> 582.9590000000001
adam it was wizards council i'm not

581.92 --> 585.92
going to

582.959 --> 587.1199999999999
get into the content of that but it was

585.92 --> 591.36
good

587.12 --> 595.279
gave me a lot of reassurance

591.36 --> 598.88
like that like yeah

595.279 --> 601.8389999999999
i'm not alone in the in the whole

598.88 --> 602.64
debacle everything the weird [ __ ] that

601.839 --> 605.7600000000001
going down

602.64 --> 607.92
everywhere around us other people and

605.76 --> 611.6
other groups and all that [ __ ]

607.92 --> 614.959
and then afterward

611.6 --> 616.8000000000001
i was like i had rolled this this joint

614.959 --> 618.7199999999999
and hadn't smoked it the entire call

616.8 --> 620.079
which lasts like two hours or something

618.72 --> 621.97
or more

620.079 --> 623.279
and then afterwards like yeah

621.97 --> 627.2
[Music]

623.279 --> 631.68
okay one last joint before i go to bed

627.2 --> 635.0400000000001
and i went outside and it looked

631.68 --> 637.68
like australia i just took a look it was

635.04 --> 638.7199999999999
a very dark so there was no clear sky or

637.68 --> 642.2399999999999
anything

638.72 --> 646.5600000000001
and see that chimney you see over there

642.24 --> 650.48
right that thing sticking out

646.56 --> 653.76
they're right there

650.48 --> 658.0
silently was this thing

653.76 --> 659.8389999999999
sitting on it it's like what that a bird

658.0 --> 661.76
there's a bird sitting on there in the

659.839 --> 664.8800000000001
middle of the night guess what it was an

661.76 --> 667.6
owl it was an owl just sitting there

664.88 --> 668.8
looking at me as it was just smoking

667.6 --> 672.0
there like okay and

668.8 --> 672.4799999999999
let's not make any sudden moves it's

672.0 --> 676.48
just an

672.48 --> 680.0790000000001
owl sitting on that chimney

676.48 --> 683.279
looking at me in the middle of this

680.079 --> 685.519
i've seen owls fly by pretty close but

683.279 --> 688.64
he was literally just sitting there

685.519 --> 691.279
and looking at me for like

688.64 --> 691.279
two minutes

692.32 --> 698.0
that was pretty amazing it felt pretty

695.44 --> 701.2790000000001
amazing it was almost like oh

698.0 --> 703.44
maybe me coming out as a wizard and

701.279 --> 704.56
actually saying it seriously and not as

703.44 --> 706.5600000000001
a joke

704.56 --> 708.0
and declaring myself like that it has

706.56 --> 710.4799999999999
drawn in

708.0 --> 712.399
the attention of some other wizards and

710.48 --> 713.6
they're sending their owls to check me

712.399 --> 716.72
up or something

713.6 --> 719.279
that's almost like how it felt it was

716.72 --> 719.279
amazing

722.32 --> 726.24
all right yeah there and i know there

725.519 --> 728.16
are owls

726.24 --> 730.0
over here in this in this region and

728.16 --> 731.1999999999999
sometimes in the night do hear the isles

730.0 --> 734.079
in the distance

731.2 --> 734.72
they like to hang around in some of the

734.079 --> 738.16
more

734.72 --> 739.2
foresty like areas like parks sort of a

738.16 --> 741.76
park over there

739.2 --> 743.12
with walking ways and just close trees

741.76 --> 745.2
together and they like that

743.12 --> 746.16
the owls like to hang around there but

745.2 --> 749.2
this time he was just

746.16 --> 750.88
literally sitting on that chimney which

749.2 --> 753.44
is like

750.88 --> 754.399
five meters away from me from my balcony

753.44 --> 757.44
from my door and

754.399 --> 760.48
exit pretty pretty interesting

757.44 --> 762.5600000000001
did not expect that of course other

760.48 --> 763.12
wizards know it's flat too absolutely

762.56 --> 766.8
they do

763.12 --> 766.8
they wouldn't be wizards if they weren't

767.12 --> 770.8
otherwise you're just a delusional

769.839 --> 772.8800000000001
hippie

770.8 --> 774.7199999999999
figure that thinks they're a wizard and

772.88 --> 776.48
they're not because they constantly fall

774.72 --> 778.8000000000001
for [ __ ] stories that

776.48 --> 780.32
demons just make up out of nothing pull

778.8 --> 780.639
out of their ass and then they believe

780.32 --> 782.1600000000001
it

780.639 --> 784.839
you're not a wizard if you do that a

782.16 --> 788.3199999999999
wizard does not believe

784.839 --> 791.6
nonsense right but you can think

788.32 --> 791.6
you're a wizard if you like

792.88 --> 797.04
all right anyway let's see who is in

795.519 --> 799.279
chat

797.04 --> 801.8389999999999
after 15 minutes almost flat earth

799.279 --> 804.399
accord or flat accord music's first

801.839 --> 807.519
aramistan stone

804.399 --> 811.519
jim west zeptappy dark steve

807.519 --> 812.24
84 michael jones yeah good to see you

811.519 --> 815.279
all

812.24 --> 818.9590000000001
this tuesday

815.279 --> 818.959
the 8th of december

819.68 --> 825.8389999999999
i never met a risen in real life

822.72 --> 827.9200000000001
i've never oh well i might have

825.839 --> 829.519
but they were probably ball squirting

827.92 --> 832.639
wizards at the time

829.519 --> 832.639
you know because

832.8 --> 840.0
like even at like uh renaissance fair

836.959 --> 841.04
places there are people that do come

840.0 --> 842.639
there

841.04 --> 844.639
there are people that are like very

842.639 --> 846.8
seriously witches

844.639 --> 848.9590000000001
i hope not in the evil fashion but i

846.8 --> 849.8389999999999
can't confirm or deny that because i

848.959 --> 852.6389999999999
don't know them

849.839 --> 854.639
and they did seem kind of ominous at

852.639 --> 857.6
times some of them

854.639 --> 858.9590000000001
there are like those people that do have

857.6 --> 860.8000000000001
like covens and all that

858.959 --> 863.68
for real and they take it very serious

860.8 --> 865.4399999999999
and i have seen some of them i've

863.68 --> 867.519
met some of them they never wanted to

865.44 --> 870.24
get to know me really though at the time

867.519 --> 874.24
because at the time i was kind of like

870.24 --> 874.88
yeah tagged i was entangled with a

874.24 --> 878.32
certain

874.88 --> 879.92
jesuit guy and they could see that on me

878.32 --> 881.519
and that's good for them it's good that

879.92 --> 883.4399999999999
they know that and then kept their

881.519 --> 887.44
distance because it would have probably

883.44 --> 891.839
not worked out too well at the time

887.44 --> 894.72
because i was kind of like a yeah

891.839 --> 896.32
slightly mind controlled drone and i i

894.72 --> 898.24
sort of did realize there's just nothing

896.32 --> 901.6
i could do about it

898.24 --> 904.9590000000001
i was not capable of basically throwing

901.6 --> 904.9590000000001
off all the shackles yet

906.639 --> 910.24
right so there are probably other

908.24 --> 912.0
wizards out there i don't know what they

910.24 --> 913.6800000000001
think about cosmogene i'm pretty

912.0 --> 916.0
sure they're aware the earth is actually

913.68 --> 918.0
flat and that the globe's a line that's

916.0 --> 919.199
giant satanic apparatus trying to mind

918.0 --> 922.56
control everybody

919.199 --> 923.12
it's like the first lesson that even

922.56 --> 925.76
makes you

923.12 --> 927.199
able to sort of become a wizard in the

925.76 --> 930.56
first place

927.199 --> 933.199
you know because at the time i was

930.56 --> 934.88
i kind of like got into this little

933.199 --> 936.959
witches circle sort of thing

934.88 --> 938.0
kind of friendly and one of the things

936.959 --> 940.0
they did was

938.0 --> 941.199
absolutely tell me oh you think the

940.0 --> 945.44
globe

941.199 --> 949.04
it's flat it was like what what

945.44 --> 949.44
yeah so pretty sure that that's kind of

949.04 --> 953.5999999999999
like

949.44 --> 955.0400000000001
fact number one for that sort of stuff

953.6 --> 956.48
and then they just test you can you

955.04 --> 958.399
handle it or are you going to turn into

956.48 --> 961.1990000000001
a global squirter and then

958.399 --> 963.839
obviously absolutely get ejected never

961.199 --> 965.7589999999999
to be seen again

963.839 --> 968.399
because they don't want to freaking deal

965.759 --> 970.399
with with crazy maniac that constantly

968.399 --> 972.32
watching no they're gonna shut you down

970.399 --> 974.639
you're evil oh you're actually evil

972.32 --> 976.9590000000001
because you don't believe the globe

974.639 --> 979.6
yeah they don't like that [ __ ] very

976.959 --> 979.5999999999999
obviously

980.839 --> 985.839
so

982.56 --> 987.4399999999999
all right yeah that good

985.839 --> 989.36
and well it's good that it makes perfect

987.44 --> 990.8000000000001
sense to use zap tappy it makes perfect

989.36 --> 993.6
sense

990.8 --> 994.56
to me that it makes perfect sense to you

993.6 --> 997.6800000000001
although

994.56 --> 1000.4799999999999
not really but yeah it's just

997.68 --> 1001.3599999999999
logical because why the [ __ ] would

1000.48 --> 1004.0790000000001
somebody that's

1001.36 --> 1006.16
really into the truth go with all that

1004.079 --> 1007.199
nonsense when obviously most of it's

1006.16 --> 1010.88
just made up

1007.199 --> 1013.3599999999999
blatantly blatantly made up you know

1010.88 --> 1015.12
at i was at the point back then that i

1013.36 --> 1018.0790000000001
still believe the globe

1015.12 --> 1019.36
i just knew everything that was being

1018.079 --> 1022.8
told about it was

1019.36 --> 1024.799
made up [ __ ] that was where i was i

1022.8 --> 1028.799
believe the globe i thought

1024.799 --> 1031.36
why aren't we actually going up there

1028.799 --> 1032.0
and checking it out why is it all

1031.36 --> 1035.52
[ __ ]

1032.0 --> 1037.28
cgi and [ __ ] nonsense stories

1035.52 --> 1040.0
why is everybody doing that and thinks

1037.28 --> 1042.8799999999999
it's okay to literally never find out

1040.0 --> 1043.839
that was my frustration right and that

1042.88 --> 1045.919
was before i

1043.839 --> 1048.48
actually figured out that that there

1045.919 --> 1051.2800000000002
really was no possibility for any of it

1048.48 --> 1053.44
that it's just that it's flat right but

1051.28 --> 1054.8799999999999
i already knew like yeah everything

1053.44 --> 1057.039
that's being told about is just

1054.88 --> 1058.64
obviously lies and [ __ ]

1057.039 --> 1061.6
it doesn't make any damn sense there's

1058.64 --> 1067.8400000000001
no logical consistency in any of it

1061.6 --> 1067.84
it's blatantly made up stories

1068.16 --> 1075.679
what is or something like that

1071.84 --> 1078.8799999999999
oh whatever it is what it is

1075.679 --> 1081.919
it's what people can call themselves

1078.88 --> 1085.679
it's not very christian they though

1081.919 --> 1085.679
yeah i wasn't very christian at the time

1086.4 --> 1090.96
and yeah doesn't necessarily have to be

1089.679 --> 1093.039
nefarious

1090.96 --> 1094.16
but yeah some of these people do get

1093.039 --> 1096.4
like kind of

1094.16 --> 1098.16
nefarious minded and then the others

1096.4 --> 1100.5590000000002
just let them

1098.16 --> 1101.44
they don't try to correct them that that

1100.559 --> 1103.36
was a thing

1101.44 --> 1105.3600000000001
like in that group culture that i did

1103.36 --> 1107.6789999999999
not appreciate it's like okay if people

1105.36 --> 1109.76
are really starting to behave badly

1107.679 --> 1111.52
why the [ __ ] aren't you correcting them

1109.76 --> 1114.799
morally like this that's

1111.52 --> 1115.2
bad policy so i didn't agree with that

1114.799 --> 1118.799
part

1115.2 --> 1120.48
at all right and it's also why i

1118.799 --> 1122.72
eventually decide like okay i'm not a

1120.48 --> 1124.96
group wizard i'm a solitary wizard

1122.72 --> 1125.76
i'm eclectic i will figure this out on

1124.96 --> 1128.88
my own

1125.76 --> 1131.679
because other people are just

1128.88 --> 1132.96
everybody's corrupted everybody in the

1131.679 --> 1136.3200000000002
[ __ ] world

1132.96 --> 1136.72
is corrupted so the only way to do it

1136.32 --> 1140.08
right

1136.72 --> 1143.679
is to do it completely on my own

1140.08 --> 1146.8799999999999
i'm not gonna bind myself with any other

1143.679 --> 1146.88
type of person like that

1148.84 --> 1153.28
right but this is all like 15 years ago

1152.32 --> 1156.559
and [ __ ]

1153.28 --> 1160.6399999999999
more even yeah

1156.559 --> 1163.28
no yeah 15 years ago most of it

1160.64 --> 1164.0800000000002
i did go to like this group for like two

1163.28 --> 1166.799
years

1164.08 --> 1169.28
on a weekly basis was no longer at

1166.799 --> 1172.16
school or anything so had all that time

1169.28 --> 1173.28
just went there and then come together

1172.16 --> 1175.679
and

1173.28 --> 1177.12
was really disappointing in retrospect

1175.679 --> 1180.16
because most of what we did was like

1177.12 --> 1183.12
ooh make candles with which theme

1180.16 --> 1183.919
thingies like it's kind of lame like

1183.12 --> 1187.6
that

1183.919 --> 1192.4
most of it was kind of lame but

1187.6 --> 1194.799
yeah it's what it was what it was

1192.4 --> 1196.64
and eventually like there was just a

1194.799 --> 1200.24
giant argument with the

1196.64 --> 1202.48
coven leader supposedly who turned out

1200.24 --> 1204.48
to be quite a little psychopath

1202.48 --> 1207.919
and control freak and would literally

1204.48 --> 1211.039
lie about people including myself

1207.919 --> 1211.76
in the to the faces of others in the

1211.039 --> 1214.24
group

1211.76 --> 1216.48
like blatantly disgusting lies like you

1214.24 --> 1219.84
like rape accusations and [ __ ] totally

1216.48 --> 1222.0
out of nowhere pathological eye level

1219.84 --> 1224.24
when i wasn't there and she i wasn't

1222.0 --> 1226.159
alone and did that to others too

1224.24 --> 1229.52
and so people eventually find out like

1226.159 --> 1232.5590000000002
okay she's a deranged psychopath

1229.52 --> 1234.08
and a pathological liar okay well that

1232.559 --> 1236.72
was that

1234.08 --> 1238.1589999999999
see you later we're not gonna do this

1236.72 --> 1240.96
anymore

1238.159 --> 1242.72
so yeah that was kind of sad how that

1240.96 --> 1246.4
all unrolled

1242.72 --> 1249.44
but i did learn a couple of

1246.4 --> 1252.159
just general things

1249.44 --> 1252.48
that in retrospect you don't need to go

1252.159 --> 1254.64
to

1252.48 --> 1256.48
freaking coven to learn that you can

1254.64 --> 1258.48
just find a couple of wise people and

1256.48 --> 1260.24
they'll just straight out tell you

1258.48 --> 1262.159
probably from a more christian

1260.24 --> 1263.84
perspective which makes it much more

1262.159 --> 1268.0800000000002
viable

1263.84 --> 1271.12
so yeah that all happened like

1268.08 --> 1271.12
15 years ago

1274.08 --> 1280.559
we can earth worship no no not really

1277.6 --> 1281.76
or maybe i don't care i'm not like that

1280.559 --> 1284.799
at all

1281.76 --> 1288.96
i'm a wizard but i'm also

1284.799 --> 1292.96
a esoteric eclectic christian

1288.96 --> 1293.28
no person will tell me how to do things

1292.96 --> 1296.0
no

1293.28 --> 1296.96
book will tell me how to do things only

1296.0 --> 1300.32
the essence

1296.96 --> 1303.52
itself that i may attain from a book

1300.32 --> 1307.2
or a person will tell me what to do

1303.52 --> 1308.559
and that is basically exactly how it's

1307.2 --> 1311.919
going to work

1308.559 --> 1314.1589999999999
so nobody can ever tell me you did it

1311.919 --> 1314.159
wrong

1315.039 --> 1320.72
right they can point at a mistake and if

1318.96 --> 1321.679
i recognize that mistake i will try to

1320.72 --> 1324.0
correct it

1321.679 --> 1325.6000000000001
they can never say you are doing it the

1324.0 --> 1326.799
wrong way you should do it like this

1325.6 --> 1329.039
then i say immediately okay

1326.799 --> 1330.559
go [ __ ] yourself i don't want to talk to

1329.039 --> 1333.2
you ever again

1330.559 --> 1334.0
because you just try to manipulate me

1333.2 --> 1337.3600000000001
and i do not

1334.0 --> 1340.48
accept that ever again right

1337.36 --> 1340.4799999999998
that's how i do things

1342.799 --> 1349.44
by the way nathan oakley good to see you

1346.24 --> 1352.88
robin stanley or robin stanley is

1349.44 --> 1355.3600000000001
in a in in a personal little golden age

1352.88 --> 1355.3600000000001
right now

1355.52 --> 1361.9189999999999
it's had some really great

1358.64 --> 1363.76
things happening around her like for her

1361.919 --> 1366.88
entire region that's gonna be

1363.76 --> 1368.32
like golden she talked to me over skype

1366.88 --> 1371.2
yesterday about it

1368.32 --> 1373.12
i'll not basically lay it all out but

1371.2 --> 1376.48
really good news for her

1373.12 --> 1378.9599999999998
and for her her hometown really happy

1376.48 --> 1378.96
about that

1379.36 --> 1388.0
uh right

1383.12 --> 1392.559
jim west george sanford

1388.0 --> 1392.559
steve 84 mchanon

1395.52 --> 1398.72
everyone is corrupted and if we try to

1397.84 --> 1402.24
correct

1398.72 --> 1405.919
it we get chewed out as heretic

1402.24 --> 1408.72
or ego driven i'm sick of it

1405.919 --> 1410.64
i almost feel like just letting it go

1408.72 --> 1413.52
they can have it the world is lost well

1410.64 --> 1415.5200000000002
that that would be

1413.52 --> 1417.52
foolish decision though you know

1415.52 --> 1420.96
everybody can feel like that

1417.52 --> 1423.6
i would not do it though ever

1420.96 --> 1425.3600000000001
you know i feel i even still sometimes

1423.6 --> 1428.559
feel kind of hopeless about it

1425.36 --> 1432.08
when just the world just

1428.559 --> 1434.08
creeps up on me on my heart it's very

1432.08 --> 1436.48
disgusting when i realized like holy

1434.08 --> 1439.36
[ __ ] like everybody is just like

1436.48 --> 1440.24
eager to corrupt in the face of the

1439.36 --> 1443.36
truth like they're

1440.24 --> 1444.32
eager for it the eager to switch to

1443.36 --> 1447.4399999999998
darkness

1444.32 --> 1448.96
that's the [ __ ] that i feel sometimes

1447.44 --> 1450.799
like they're all

1448.96 --> 1452.48
normal people and they're almost like

1450.799 --> 1455.12
respon like waiting

1452.48 --> 1456.559
for me to go to the next level so they

1455.12 --> 1459.039
can then

1456.559 --> 1459.9189999999999
take off another cloak of good and

1459.039 --> 1462.72
reveal more

1459.919 --> 1464.64
evil that they want to be that's the

1462.72 --> 1466.32
[ __ ] that i have to deal with sometimes

1464.64 --> 1469.2
mentally

1466.32 --> 1469.6
really painful but it is what it is and

1469.2 --> 1473.1200000000001
there's

1469.6 --> 1473.9189999999999
nothing i can do about it and basically

1473.12 --> 1476.559
giving up

1473.919 --> 1477.2
is giving all of it exactly what it

1476.559 --> 1480.24
wants

1477.2 --> 1483.8400000000001
it's iron man's victory if you do that

1480.24 --> 1486.48
so you have to or i decide for myself

1483.84 --> 1489.1999999999998
myself i have to basically continue i

1486.48 --> 1491.2
have to not let it phase me

1489.2 --> 1493.44
and if that means that everybody else in

1491.2 --> 1494.799
the world decides to commit suicide

1493.44 --> 1497.76
because they are all obsessed with

1494.799 --> 1499.52
demonics then so be it then i'll be the

1497.76 --> 1500.559
last person in the world and that's my

1499.52 --> 1503.44
decision

1500.559 --> 1505.12
now let's hope it doesn't get to that

1503.44 --> 1508.64
point

1505.12 --> 1510.6399999999999
right but i will never give up no matter

1508.64 --> 1512.4
how horrific

1510.64 --> 1514.0
no matter how horrific things get out

1512.4 --> 1517.1200000000001
there literally the entire

1514.0 --> 1518.24
world would have to be destroyed and

1517.12 --> 1520.32
then even like if

1518.24 --> 1522.96
everything was destroyed there's only

1520.32 --> 1524.6399999999999
smoldering craters every only smoldering

1522.96 --> 1526.96
craters nothing left

1524.64 --> 1528.3200000000002
i will still not give up i will continue

1526.96 --> 1531.44
on

1528.32 --> 1532.3999999999999
right because there is nothing that can

1531.44 --> 1535.679
ever happen

1532.4 --> 1536.799
to stop me as long as i live and maybe

1535.679 --> 1539.8400000000001
even beyond

1536.799 --> 1540.96
life maybe even into death i will just

1539.84 --> 1544.0
never give up

1540.96 --> 1548.72
until basically god says to me in

1544.0 --> 1551.919
face like it's time to stop

1548.72 --> 1553.3600000000001
and that means like the end so yeah

1551.919 --> 1557.76
that's the only thing that's going to

1553.36 --> 1563.9189999999999
make me stop nothing else will

1557.76 --> 1563.919
right flat record music what's that link

1569.039 --> 1573.84
the darkness has to face those of us

1571.6 --> 1574.24
with inspiration be bold and hold your

1573.84 --> 1576.72
ground

1574.24 --> 1577.44
absolutely good advice there robin

1576.72 --> 1585.84
stanley

1577.44 --> 1585.8400000000001
i totally do

1587.279 --> 1592.159
if all men are corrupt where's satan if

1589.52 --> 1595.76
the truth doesn't exist

1592.159 --> 1597.6000000000001
what that what because everybody is

1595.76 --> 1598.24
corrupt then the truth doesn't exist

1597.6 --> 1600.9599999999998
that's

1598.24 --> 1602.88
that's self-contradictory just because

1600.96 --> 1605.2
everybody rejects the truth doesn't mean

1602.88 --> 1607.919
that the truth no longer exists

1605.2 --> 1609.6000000000001
the corruption itself is basically the

1607.919 --> 1610.96
rejection of truth

1609.6 --> 1613.4399999999998
that doesn't mean that the truth no

1610.96 --> 1616.64
longer exists that's like saying that

1613.44 --> 1619.1200000000001
if everybody lies then the lies becomes

1616.64 --> 1620.88
the truth that's totally incorrect no it

1619.12 --> 1622.799
just means that everybody lies

1620.88 --> 1624.24
and that means that everybody is

1622.799 --> 1626.4
avoiding

1624.24 --> 1628.159
that specific truth that pertains to the

1626.4 --> 1630.96
lie

1628.159 --> 1631.44
see remember yesterday's hangout the

1630.96 --> 1635.279
title

1631.44 --> 1637.039
how i explained that make a mistake

1635.279 --> 1638.559
and you correct that mistake as soon as

1637.039 --> 1640.48
you find out it's a mistake and if you

1638.559 --> 1642.8799999999999
don't then it becomes a lie

1640.48 --> 1643.84
but that never takes away from what the

1642.88 --> 1646.3200000000002
truth is

1643.84 --> 1649.36
the truth is the truth it can never be

1646.32 --> 1652.399
made anything other than the truth

1649.36 --> 1653.9189999999999
can only be avoided that's the only

1652.399 --> 1655.6789999999999
thing you can do with it the truth can

1653.919 --> 1658.48
never go away

1655.679 --> 1660.3990000000001
can be forgotten it can be avoided but

1658.48 --> 1662.96
it always will be what it is

1660.399 --> 1663.4399999999998
the truth no matter what happens no

1662.96 --> 1665.8400000000001
matter

1663.44 --> 1670.799
what happens so that trainer thought

1665.84 --> 1670.799
kind of illogical in my opinion there

1671.52 --> 1680.84
because the truth always exists

1674.559 --> 1683.84
god exists he has to be it's ontological

1680.84 --> 1683.84
primitive

1684.88 --> 1689.2
without truth there cannot be lies

1690.08 --> 1694.799
see because if there is no more truth

1693.44 --> 1698.96
then

1694.799 --> 1698.96
the concept of lie doesn't mean anything

1699.039 --> 1702.24
if there's no truth then how do you

1700.64 --> 1706.3990000000001
evade it

1702.24 --> 1706.3990000000001
you see so no

1709.6 --> 1713.039
that's correct george sanford the truth

1711.44 --> 1716.24
is the truth no matter what you believe

1713.039 --> 1718.399
exactly oh

1716.24 --> 1720.72
god the movie excalibur yeah i still

1718.399 --> 1722.7199999999998
have it i still have it on my computer i

1720.72 --> 1725.279
haven't watched it didn't get to it

1722.72 --> 1726.48
i'm so sorry i i really haven't watched

1725.279 --> 1730.0
any movies now

1726.48 --> 1731.2
in over a week and i

1730.0 --> 1733.279
like to be fair it's not like i'm

1731.2 --> 1735.52
getting distracted by anything specific

1733.279 --> 1737.36
like i haven't played baldur's gate 3

1735.52 --> 1741.6
either

1737.36 --> 1744.6399999999999
i've just been basically skype calling

1741.6 --> 1745.76
and being in chats and hangouts all day

1744.64 --> 1748.64
long yesterday just

1745.76 --> 1750.1589999999999
all day the entire day from beginning to

1748.64 --> 1753.6000000000001
end just non-stop

1750.159 --> 1756.88
skype calling another skype call

1753.6 --> 1759.9189999999999
then a really really long skype call

1756.88 --> 1763.0390000000002
and then eventually i went to bed

1759.919 --> 1764.88
so it was just online all day

1763.039 --> 1767.84
no time to do anything else no time to

1764.88 --> 1767.8400000000001
watch a movie

1778.96 --> 1782.159
right but it's on my computer i can

1780.96 --> 1785.039
watch it i just

1782.159 --> 1786.88
haven't got it to it i haven't found a

1785.039 --> 1790.24
call moment where i'd actually have the

1786.88 --> 1790.24
time to just watch a movie

1796.32 --> 1801.9189999999999
oh man i clean up a lot of stuff

1799.84 --> 1803.76
they wanted to say [ __ ] but it's a lot

1801.919 --> 1806.64
of stuff yesterday

1803.76 --> 1807.279
like total of eight bags filled with

1806.64 --> 1810.64
paper

1807.279 --> 1812.399
and glass not mixed in one was glass

1810.64 --> 1815.44
really big one and the rest was all just

1812.399 --> 1817.6
paper paper lots of newspapers

1815.44 --> 1819.3600000000001
like two times where i hadn't delivered

1817.6 --> 1820.6399999999999
the newspapers because i was sick or it

1819.36 --> 1822.7199999999998
was raining too hard

1820.64 --> 1825.039
they just stacked up i all had to put it

1822.72 --> 1827.679
in into the paper bin

1825.039 --> 1831.2
so i spent like an hour yesterday just

1827.679 --> 1833.2
going back and forth like three times

1831.2 --> 1834.64
dumping all that paper in the glass and

1833.2 --> 1839.039
now finally it's

1834.64 --> 1844.3200000000002
all cleaned up it's empty it's been like

1839.039 --> 1844.32
half a year i just needed to do it

1844.559 --> 1851.84
glad i did it finally all that junk's

1848.84 --> 1851.84
gone

1861.84 --> 1867.279
and even like in the download scene

1865.039 --> 1870.24
it's a pretty popular movie i noticed

1867.279 --> 1874.24
like there were a lot of people actually

1870.24 --> 1874.24
seeding it so

1874.32 --> 1877.4399999999998
it's not like some weird movie from the

1876.399 --> 1879.5189999999998
80s that

1877.44 --> 1880.88
that nobody cares about and there's like

1879.519 --> 1883.519
one person that's

1880.88 --> 1885.3600000000001
seeding it no there was plenty plenty of

1883.519 --> 1888.3990000000001
people seeding that movie so i think

1885.36 --> 1891.039
it's a pretty popular movie

1888.399 --> 1892.0
i am going to watch it at some point

1891.039 --> 1895.039
just

1892.0 --> 1895.039
haven't gotten to it

1904.84 --> 1907.84
right

1912.32 --> 1915.4399999999998
because it's very white known with no

1914.48 --> 1921.84
nectars okay

1915.44 --> 1921.8400000000001
sure sure

1922.559 --> 1926.1589999999999
all right got a couple of notes from

1924.159 --> 1929.2
yesterday not too extensive but just

1926.159 --> 1932.0800000000002
for a reminder like the flatter debates

1929.2 --> 1932.48
was very good i was very active in it

1932.08 --> 1935.84
too

1932.48 --> 1937.3600000000001
in the sense that it wasn't i

1935.84 --> 1939.1999999999998
just got a couple of good moments in

1937.36 --> 1941.6
there

1939.2 --> 1944.24
then yeah at the end at the end of the

1941.6 --> 1946.399
after show i kind of left

1944.24 --> 1948.159
to do all to dump all that paper because

1946.399 --> 1950.32
i was like yeah i can't postpone this

1948.159 --> 1953.3600000000001
[ __ ] anyway i gotta do this right now

1950.32 --> 1956.24
just gotta do it all right now

1953.36 --> 1957.4399999999998
and i did so i missed the last part

1956.24 --> 1960.64
don't know what happened

1957.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
on the after show at the last part i'll

1960.64 --> 1966.24
hear that back at some point

1963.84 --> 1968.32
also later the evening there was owen

1966.24 --> 1971.039
benjamin live again

1968.32 --> 1971.039

1971.36 --> 1974.1589999999999
that's good stuff

1974.72 --> 1979.1200000000001
what is it about again i kind of

1978.159 --> 1980.7990000000002
forgotten

1979.12 --> 1983.76
i've kind of forgotten what it was about

1980.799 --> 1986.399
again because afterwards like yeah

1983.76 --> 1989.36
i still got like the the skype call in

1986.399 --> 1992.6399999999999
my head that we had yesterday

1989.36 --> 1994.8799999999999
me nathan and qe

1992.64 --> 1994.88
and

1995.84 --> 2005.84
and adam because that was pretty long

2000.08 --> 2005.84

2005.919 --> 2008.96
because like a little wizards council

2007.76 --> 2011.919

2008.96 --> 2012.48
it was good stuff did it kind of also

2011.919 --> 2016.159
like

2012.48 --> 2017.44
did give me a lot of reassuring feelings

2016.159 --> 2019.7600000000002
like

2017.44 --> 2020.48
i'm not being like i'm being taken

2022.96 --> 2026.08
because

2023.6 --> 2028.1589999999999
yeah when you go against when you got a

2026.08 --> 2030.8799999999999
lot of people facing you like this freak

2065.359 --> 2071.839
try to avoid talking

2068.48 --> 2074.2400000000002
about it because it's just

2071.839 --> 2076.32
big trouble it's a cave troll don't

2074.24 --> 2080.72
don't do it don't engage

2093.76 --> 2097.0400000000004
don't know his voice i heard that it's

2095.52 --> 2099.04
very annoying and

2097.04 --> 2100.96
some people said it's scary or something

2099.04 --> 2103.839
i don't care

2100.96 --> 2103.839
the guy's a freak

2106.56 --> 2109.7599999999998

2109.2 --> 2113.04
they have

2109.76 --> 2113.6800000000003
like in the last month or so it really

2113.04 --> 2116.24
makes you

2113.68 --> 2118.64
feel like oh god are every is everybody

2116.24 --> 2121.2799999999997
going to abandon me now

2118.64 --> 2122.16
because yeah because suddenly i got all

2121.28 --> 2124.4
these enemies

2122.16 --> 2126.16
that's a fear i have it's like i'm

2124.4 --> 2127.599
afraid like people are going to abandon

2126.16 --> 2129.2
me because it's going to be too much

2127.599 --> 2130.32
hassle it's going to be too much strain

2129.2 --> 2133.1189999999997
and they can't

2130.32 --> 2134.079
they can't deal with it but i basically

2133.119 --> 2138.4
got some

2134.079 --> 2138.4
yeah some verbal reassurances

2138.72 --> 2142.56
in the meeting that basically yeah they

2142.079 --> 2145.6800000000003
said

2142.56 --> 2148.24
well we we we got your back

2145.68 --> 2149.9199999999996
and i knew that from adam adams had my

2148.24 --> 2152.24
back since the very start

2149.92 --> 2153.599
even when i was a little wilder than i

2152.24 --> 2157.2799999999997
am now

2153.599 --> 2159.52
a little less responsible natured

2157.28 --> 2160.48
a little less control over myself he's

2159.52 --> 2163.839
always backed me he's

2160.48 --> 2166.72
awesome adam is awesome

2163.839 --> 2168.4
but it was just good to hear everybody's

2166.72 --> 2173.68
standing and

2168.4 --> 2177.28
yeah was very reassuring

2173.68 --> 2179.5989999999997
so i went to bed like with a calm heart

2177.28 --> 2181.2000000000003
and a little bit of wonder having seen

2179.599 --> 2183.04
that owl

2181.2 --> 2184.56
staring me in the face sitting there on

2183.04 --> 2186.72
the chimney

2184.56 --> 2190.0789999999997
right after the skype call so that was

2186.72 --> 2190.0789999999997
pretty much my day yesterday

2194.64 --> 2199.5989999999997
yeah mac hadn't exactly that's exactly

2197.839 --> 2202.24
it

2199.599 --> 2204.7200000000003
that's not boromir that's aragorn that

2202.24 --> 2204.72
says that

2208.88 --> 2212.7200000000003
like remember they're shooting like

2211.76 --> 2216.5600000000004
shooting

2212.72 --> 2219.52
through the door and then aragorn like

2216.56 --> 2221.68
looks quickly through it's like they

2219.52 --> 2225.04
have a cave troll

2221.68 --> 2225.04
yeah i love that scene

2225.28 --> 2231.3590000000004
it's so fitting it's insane like

2228.88 --> 2232.4
that i call him that i even described

2231.359 --> 2235.5989999999997
that to the guys

2232.4 --> 2238.7200000000003
in skype call yesterday it fits it fits

2235.599 --> 2240.4
perfectly even device like yeah how do

2238.72 --> 2243.7599999999998
you deal with a cave troll

2240.4 --> 2247.599
describe that and yeah it's

2243.76 --> 2249.44
it fits perfectly it's crazy how well

2247.599 --> 2251.92
the analogy works

2249.44 --> 2251.92
crazy

2253.28 --> 2257.52
damn it youtube stop freaking stalling

2256.24 --> 2260.9599999999996
you stupid thing

2257.52 --> 2263.7599999999998
just keep it playing stop winding behind

2260.96 --> 2263.76
ten minutes

2264.079 --> 2271.8390000000004
jesus freaking youtube

2267.44 --> 2271.839
every time he does that [ __ ] so annoying

2273.53 --> 2278.7200000000003
[Music]

2275.2 --> 2278.72
love to see a wild owl

2279.28 --> 2285.3590000000004
i think it was like a typical church out

2283.2 --> 2286.72
although it was purely in the dark right

2285.359 --> 2290.0789999999997
but they could still make out

2286.72 --> 2291.52
slightly what it was like so it seemed

2290.079 --> 2294.96
like it had like

2291.52 --> 2297.52
gray and a little white

2294.96 --> 2299.44
and some black spot it was like a black

2297.52 --> 2302.0
spotted gray and white owl

2299.44 --> 2303.2000000000003
very typical type of owl i think it was

2302.0 --> 2306.079
it wasn't like super

2303.2 --> 2306.3999999999996
mini one it was like a pretty big one

2306.079 --> 2309.2000000000003
like

2306.4 --> 2311.119
this big sitting on the chimney it stuck

2309.2 --> 2312.8799999999997
out this much so the tail might have

2311.119 --> 2315.92
stuck out a little more but i could see

2312.88 --> 2318.2400000000002
so it was like this high so it's pretty

2315.92 --> 2322.079
average sized owl i don't know what type

2318.24 --> 2323.7599999999998
it was you could probably look that up

2322.079 --> 2326.8
but that's the one that that was sitting

2323.76 --> 2329.28
there staring me in the face

2326.8 --> 2331.44
as i was smoking my last joint of the

2329.28 --> 2335.44
evening

2331.44 --> 2338.8
my cat got a bed oh wow that's pretty

2335.44 --> 2341.839
how did he do that because bats don't

2338.8 --> 2341.8390000000004
come to the ground

2342.079 --> 2347.04
that's bizarre and sad because bats are

2345.92 --> 2350.48
really nice

2347.04 --> 2353.68
they're awesome creatures they've been

2350.48 --> 2357.119
slandered to no end even through

2353.68 --> 2358.3999999999996
folklore [ __ ] bats are awesome they eat

2357.119 --> 2361.2000000000003
mosquitoes

2358.4 --> 2361.2000000000003
a lot of them

2364.72 --> 2370.0789999999997
and they don't bother anybody else

2368.0 --> 2372.16
that yeah there are bats that do though

2370.079 --> 2375.44
like real vampire bats

2372.16 --> 2377.1189999999997
but not all bats are like that most bats

2375.44 --> 2382.7200000000003
just eat mosquitoes for blood

2377.119 --> 2384.7200000000003
that's it

2382.72 --> 2386.3999999999996
but there are bigger ones that are like

2384.72 --> 2387.9199999999996
more like flying i don't know how do

2386.4 --> 2390.8
they call that it's not

2387.92 --> 2390.8
bad but like a

2391.599 --> 2395.52
winged cat or something is what they

2393.76 --> 2396.079
call them they're really big ones yeah

2395.52 --> 2399.359
those

2396.079 --> 2401.44
do like they do need too much so they

2399.359 --> 2403.68
usually start

2401.44 --> 2405.359
sitting and sucking off cattle and that

2403.68 --> 2407.359
sort of [ __ ] now there's none of that

2405.359 --> 2408.4
here that those are in the tropical

2407.359 --> 2411.839
regions

2408.4 --> 2411.839
they're really big bats

2414.64 --> 2419.52
no that's that's [ __ ] september

2417.52 --> 2420.72
that's absolute nonsense i don't know

2419.52 --> 2423.52
where you got that

2420.72 --> 2425.1189999999997
that that'll never happen i'll never

2423.52 --> 2426.319
attack people that's absolutely

2425.119 --> 2429.359
ridiculous

2426.319 --> 2432.8
they never do unless you're literally

2429.359 --> 2435.2
literally climbing in their trees

2432.8 --> 2436.88
trying to take their eggs from the nests

2435.2 --> 2437.5989999999997
yeah then they'll attack you that's the

2436.88 --> 2439.839
only time it

2437.599 --> 2441.92
will ever happen because owls don't

2439.839 --> 2444.96
attack people

2441.92 --> 2448.64
that's really stupid

2444.96 --> 2451.92
um the news well that um the news

2448.64 --> 2453.68
really so the news well the news never

2451.92 --> 2457.119
lies right

2453.68 --> 2458.319
like oh yeah bats are the source of the

2457.119 --> 2461.76
corona fires oh

2458.319 --> 2465.44
the news never lies about that right

2461.76 --> 2466.4
yeah yeah well unless you got that on

2465.44 --> 2468.319
camera

2466.4 --> 2470.2400000000002
unless you got it on camera that an

2468.319 --> 2472.24
owl's actually attacking a person

2470.24 --> 2474.24
i'm going to instantly assume that's a

2472.24 --> 2475.359
lie because it's the most ridiculous

2474.24 --> 2478.8799999999997
thing i've ever heard an

2475.359 --> 2484.96
owl attacking people that's totally dumb

2478.88 --> 2484.96
it's just [ __ ] absolutely stupid

2488.8 --> 2493.28
it was on camera was it okay well then

2491.68 --> 2496.48
it's really bizarre

2493.28 --> 2497.28
it's still ridiculous because owls don't

2496.48 --> 2499.76
do that

2497.28 --> 2501.76
so i don't know maybe it was diseased or

2499.76 --> 2504.1600000000003
something i can't imagine why would ever

2501.76 --> 2504.1600000000003
do that

2504.96 --> 2508.2400000000002
like that's not even like territorial

2507.359 --> 2512.56
behavior for an

2508.24 --> 2512.56
hour it's just ridiculous

2513.2 --> 2520.48
so oh and i just jumped oh are you

2517.76 --> 2522.4
are you disrespecting me sept happy are

2520.48 --> 2524.48
you disrespecting me

2522.4 --> 2527.359
for analyzing the situation and saying

2524.48 --> 2532.4
it's absolutely preposterous

2527.359 --> 2532.4
are you disrespecting me jumping the gun

2533.52 --> 2538.16
yeah it is [ __ ] and if it's on

2536.16 --> 2541.359
camera then it's really freaky

2538.16 --> 2543.92
because owls never do that it's totally

2541.359 --> 2543.92
bizarre

2544.48 --> 2550.64
right and yes

2547.76 --> 2551.599
assuming at first glance that something

2550.64 --> 2554.8799999999997
coming on the news

2551.599 --> 2555.76
is a total fabricated lie is really not

2554.88 --> 2560.48
that far off

2555.76 --> 2562.6400000000003
zapped happy yeah yeah that's right

2560.48 --> 2565.839
that's right you want to get a timeout

2562.64 --> 2565.839
you want to get banned

2566.16 --> 2572.56
are you done because

2569.68 --> 2574.72
yes seeing something on the news and

2572.56 --> 2576.24
instantly assuming it's a complete

2574.72 --> 2579.2
fabricated lie

2576.24 --> 2580.8799999999997
is really not that weird zapped happy

2579.2 --> 2585.1189999999997
because that [ __ ] happens

2580.88 --> 2585.119
a lot you understand

2586.8 --> 2592.96
now you might have seen the video of it

2590.079 --> 2593.3590000000004
right so yeah maybe it is true it's

2592.96 --> 2596.079
still

2593.359 --> 2596.7999999999997
pretty [ __ ] up and bizarre because

2596.079 --> 2599.8390000000004
owls

2596.8 --> 2602.319
never attack people so that was really

2599.839 --> 2605.68
weird exception

2602.319 --> 2606.4
all right zapped happy yeah jumping the

2605.68 --> 2608.0789999999997
gun

2606.4 --> 2609.76
you gotta you gotta realize that when i

2608.079 --> 2612.1600000000003
jump the gun

2609.76 --> 2614.2400000000002
if you disrespect me after that i will

2612.16 --> 2616.8799999999997
shoot you in the face and ban you

2614.24 --> 2617.839
you understand don't [ __ ] disrespect

2616.88 --> 2620.319
me

2617.839 --> 2622.88
yeah i decide that's right don't [ __ ]

2620.319 --> 2626.64
disrespect me

2622.88 --> 2628.88
all right it's not strange what i said

2626.64 --> 2630.72
it's not that far off yeah yeah it might

2628.88 --> 2631.2000000000003
be that exception that doesn't mean that

2630.72 --> 2633.5989999999997
it's

2631.2 --> 2634.8799999999997
jumping the gun when i say it's probably

2633.599 --> 2636.96
completely fake

2634.88 --> 2638.56
because it's on the news because that

2636.96 --> 2641.28
happens a lot

2638.56 --> 2643.92
all right zepped happy do we have an

2641.28 --> 2643.92
understanding

2644.0 --> 2648.24
oh oh oh okay okay well you're gonna get

2646.72 --> 2650.7999999999997
a timeout now

2648.24 --> 2652.319
because you are not complying you

2650.8 --> 2654.5600000000004
understand

2652.319 --> 2655.359
if you speak up again and you talk to me

2654.56 --> 2657.359
like that again

2655.359 --> 2659.04
you're banned i don't give a [ __ ] how

2657.359 --> 2662.96
long you've been in my chat

2659.04 --> 2663.2799999999997
you're banned don't [ __ ] disrespect

2662.96 --> 2668.48
me

2663.28 --> 2671.3590000000004
do you hear me it's not a request

2668.48 --> 2672.4
you will stop doing that i don't care

2671.359 --> 2674.88
what you feel

2672.4 --> 2676.0
about what i said i don't care you will

2674.88 --> 2680.48
stop disrespecting

2676.0 --> 2680.48
me or your band understand

2688.839 --> 2691.839
right

2707.599 --> 2714.0
deaths from house attacks that wow

2710.96 --> 2716.7200000000003
there have been deaths really

2714.0 --> 2716.72
that's bizarre

2717.599 --> 2721.44
must be a big freaking aisle then or

2719.359 --> 2723.7599999999998
they'll like pack them right on the head

2721.44 --> 2725.52
of a spot where they're just instantly

2723.76 --> 2727.5200000000004
dire so i can't imagine like an

2725.52 --> 2729.119
owl actually killing a person that's

2727.52 --> 2732.0
really weird

2729.119 --> 2734.8
but yes of course defending their young

2732.0 --> 2734.8
their nests

2736.48 --> 2739.68
their territory i don't know for sure

2738.319 --> 2742.48
though

2739.68 --> 2742.96
maybe if it's like really deep forest

2742.48 --> 2744.72
wild

2742.96 --> 2746.96
owls or something that they are more

2744.72 --> 2749.4399999999996
aggressive could be could be

2746.96 --> 2750.079
i don't know but as for owls that i've

2749.44 --> 2752.319
seen

2750.079 --> 2754.319
that are like hanging around at the edge

2752.319 --> 2757.92
of cities and all that

2754.319 --> 2757.92
never since anything like that

2758.839 --> 2761.839
ever

2766.96 --> 2773.599
had them swoop at the tractor

2770.079 --> 2775.8390000000004
really swoop at the tractor in the field

2773.599 --> 2778.8
what does that mean

2775.839 --> 2778.7999999999997
they'd fly by

2782.88 --> 2788.0
you know but sometimes look owls hunt

2786.24 --> 2791.7599999999998
mice right

2788.0 --> 2795.839
so maybe they thought there was a mouse

2791.76 --> 2797.8390000000004
like hiding somewhere on the tractor

2795.839 --> 2803.839
something like i don't know i'm just

2797.839 --> 2803.839
spitballing here

2810.96 --> 2815.2
oh well noah just if you didn't see the

2813.44 --> 2816.8
full context then why are you giving

2815.2 --> 2818.96
your opinion i don't give a [ __ ] about

2816.8 --> 2820.2400000000002
your opinion about how i should deal

2818.96 --> 2824.16
with my channel

2820.24 --> 2824.16
right i can just kick people

2824.4 --> 2827.44
it's very simple don't disrespect me

2826.88 --> 2830.4
don't

2827.44 --> 2832.0
smartmouth me ever you can tell me i'm

2830.4 --> 2833.2000000000003
technically wrong that's fine if you're

2832.0 --> 2836.079
gonna smart mouth me

2833.2 --> 2837.68
like saying i'm jumping the gun and [ __ ]

2836.079 --> 2840.079
then you are disrespecting me

2837.68 --> 2842.48
and i will punish you for it doesn't

2840.079 --> 2844.96
matter how long i've known you

2842.48 --> 2847.599
people you don't smartmouth me and the

2844.96 --> 2850.0
people in my chat that

2847.599 --> 2850.96
like really get me they know that you

2850.0 --> 2853.839
just don't do that

2850.96 --> 2854.48
i can be wrong at times but i'm never

2853.839 --> 2856.839
wrong

2854.48 --> 2858.72
without a logical trainer thought behind

2856.839 --> 2861.7599999999998
it

2858.72 --> 2862.0789999999997
right i was just being skeptical saying

2861.76 --> 2864.3190000000004
like

2862.079 --> 2866.96
oh wow in the news well that that

2864.319 --> 2869.839
doesn't mean it's real at all

2866.96 --> 2871.92
that's not like a proof that it's real

2869.839 --> 2874.319
because the news lies about the most

2871.92 --> 2876.7200000000003
ridiculous [ __ ] all the time

2874.319 --> 2879.119
because they can get away with it and

2876.72 --> 2882.48
sometimes they like to plant

2879.119 --> 2883.04
like they like to seed weird ideas in

2882.48 --> 2885.28
people

2883.04 --> 2887.68
about things out there for later

2885.28 --> 2890.3190000000004
purposes that we don't even understand

2887.68 --> 2891.7599999999998
until it starts to happen like with the

2890.319 --> 2894.16
whole bad nonsense

2891.76 --> 2895.5200000000004
corona bad nonsense remember that as

2894.16 --> 2898.64
complete nonsense

2895.52 --> 2900.64
absolute trash right

2898.64 --> 2902.0
but they do it they do it and it's all

2900.64 --> 2905.52
spreading around

2902.0 --> 2907.04
right so yeah and i'll attack the person

2905.52 --> 2910.16
it was on the news well that

2907.04 --> 2913.119
means [ __ ] to me that does not make me

2910.16 --> 2915.359
believe that's actually real at all

2913.119 --> 2916.1600000000003
it doesn't mean that it's not real

2915.359 --> 2918.0789999999997
necessary

2916.16 --> 2920.24
because apparently it does happen

2918.079 --> 2923.8390000000004
sometimes in rare occasions

2920.24 --> 2926.4799999999996
as george sanford says in a much more

2923.839 --> 2928.64
civilized manner right instead of oh

2926.48 --> 2931.52
you're jumping the gun now arwen

2928.64 --> 2932.4
oh you're so wrong oh i finally have

2931.52 --> 2935.92
something to

2932.4 --> 2938.1600000000003
somehow latch onto to think that irwin

2935.92 --> 2940.079
may be not entirely right after and i'm

2938.16 --> 2941.7599999999998
going to keep on emphasizing that with

2940.079 --> 2943.119
what i say in my feelings and all that

2941.76 --> 2944.96
yeah that's disrespecting

2943.119 --> 2946.1600000000003
i will eventually kick you if you keep

2944.96 --> 2950.079
that up

2946.16 --> 2952.96
don't have that attitude to me ever

2950.079 --> 2954.4
ever don't care don't care for your

2952.96 --> 2958.4
reasons or your motivation

2954.4 --> 2961.599
never have that attitude to be never

2958.4 --> 2964.2400000000002
yeah and now you're banned

2961.599 --> 2965.2000000000003
people can read exactly what he's saying

2964.24 --> 2968.839
right now

2965.2 --> 2971.839
yeah yeah you are banned get the [ __ ]

2968.839 --> 2971.839
out

2978.96 --> 2982.96
your input's not that important to me

2983.44 --> 2987.52
if you can't [ __ ] respect me you're

2985.68 --> 2991.04
banned i don't give a [ __ ]

2987.52 --> 2993.52
what you feel about that at all

2991.04 --> 2995.04
i don't give a [ __ ] you can run to

2993.52 --> 2997.68
whoever you like

2995.04 --> 2999.359
go on the troll bandwagon become a

2997.68 --> 3002.72
[ __ ] demon again

2999.359 --> 3005.52
right because apparently you don't care

3002.72 --> 3006.8799999999997
you don't you just don't care well if

3005.52 --> 3013.839
you don't care

3006.88 --> 3013.839
get the [ __ ] out

3020.96 --> 3025.119
i'm not gonna lose any sleep over that

3022.72 --> 3025.1189999999997
you know

3025.44 --> 3028.2400000000002
just so you know

3031.119 --> 3035.04
jim wes what do you think about this

3033.76 --> 3037.28
metal monolith

3035.04 --> 3041.52
what metal monolith and i don't think

3037.28 --> 3044.48
anything about it

3041.52 --> 3044.48
doesn't mean [ __ ]

3046.0 --> 3055.2
no you haven't really looked into it yet

3049.44 --> 3057.52
all right

3055.2 --> 3059.5989999999997
two claim to be found yeah yeah well let

3057.52 --> 3062.72
me tell you somebody put them there

3059.599 --> 3065.04
to be found to be another mystery

3062.72 --> 3067.1189999999997
i think that probably the eugenicists

3065.04 --> 3071.119
are trying to

3067.119 --> 3074.559
create an illusion like there's aliens

3071.119 --> 3075.92
or something that are basically imposing

3074.559 --> 3079.2000000000003
on humanity

3075.92 --> 3083.2000000000003
you must depopulate we

3079.2 --> 3084.3999999999996
will give you no choice and the more you

3083.2 --> 3087.2
ignore it

3084.4 --> 3087.839
the more signs will come from the

3087.2 --> 3090.48
heavens

3087.839 --> 3091.359
and the pillars will rise with the

3090.48 --> 3093.88
message

3091.359 --> 3095.2799999999997
to tell you and remind you you must

3093.88 --> 3099.44
depopulate

3095.28 --> 3102.2400000000002
or we will come

3099.44 --> 3104.319
yeah yeah it's all a ruse all of it it's

3102.24 --> 3106.319
eugenics mind control there is no

3104.319 --> 3108.64
freaking aliens there is no freaking

3106.319 --> 3110.079
overlords it's all humans

3108.64 --> 3111.359
and they are trying to mind control

3110.079 --> 3112.0
everybody into [ __ ] killing

3111.359 --> 3125.839
themselves

3112.0 --> 3125.839
that's what's going on

3128.96 --> 3133.839
the army plunked it there could be could

3131.68 --> 3133.839
be

3134.72 --> 3139.1189999999997
and who knows man i don't know maybe the

3136.8 --> 3141.52
army is [ __ ] tied into eugenics maybe

3139.119 --> 3143.52
they do have like a million people

3141.52 --> 3145.44
death squad that's that at some point is

3143.52 --> 3147.04
going to be unleashed and literally just

3145.44 --> 3150.7200000000003
start genociding

3147.04 --> 3152.88
everybody just like okay drop in europe

3150.72 --> 3154.8799999999997
and then like okay we're gonna kill

3152.88 --> 3156.2400000000002
five million in this city and move on to

3154.88 --> 3157.6800000000003
the next then we're gonna kill 10

3156.24 --> 3160.8799999999997
million over there

3157.68 --> 3163.04
who knows there might be a army of

3160.88 --> 3164.96
freaks that are literally just going to

3163.04 --> 3167.92
execute everything and everyone

3164.96 --> 3169.2
with super high-tech weapons and [ __ ]

3167.92 --> 3172.96
maybe it will

3169.2 --> 3174.7999999999997
could be it's not [ __ ] aliens

3172.96 --> 3176.079
and it's not some freaking god or

3174.8 --> 3179.119
anything no it's

3176.079 --> 3179.6800000000003
people with too much power that have

3179.119 --> 3182.7200000000003
become

3179.68 --> 3183.68
absolutely possessed by the spirit of

3182.72 --> 3186.8799999999997
death and iron

3183.68 --> 3189.2799999999997
which is the primary factor in eugenics

3186.88 --> 3190.079
it's the spirit of death spirit that

3189.28 --> 3193.52
says

3190.079 --> 3195.2000000000003
no i don't care that people actually

3193.52 --> 3196.72
start to function better with good

3195.2 --> 3197.2
spirit if they're in good spirit when

3196.72 --> 3199.68
they're

3197.2 --> 3200.5589999999997
in with more numbers that it becomes we

3199.68 --> 3203.7599999999998
don't care

3200.559 --> 3205.44
we just want to be in a world where

3203.76 --> 3208.3190000000004
you're looking around and not

3205.44 --> 3209.68
see people that's what they want it's

3208.319 --> 3212.4
the only thing they want

3209.68 --> 3214.0
and they will literally kill everything

3212.4 --> 3216.2400000000002
including their own soul

3214.0 --> 3219.599
their connection to god to achieve it

3216.24 --> 3219.5989999999997
and that's called eugenics

3219.839 --> 3223.04
and i really do hope that they don't

3221.68 --> 3225.52
have like a

3223.04 --> 3226.96
10 million people army to start doing

3225.52 --> 3228.72
that [ __ ] at some point

3226.96 --> 3230.559
but they might and i don't know where

3228.72 --> 3231.359
they would come from whether they would

3230.559 --> 3234.96
be

3231.359 --> 3235.44
like this globalist gathered psychopath

3234.96 --> 3237.76
army

3235.44 --> 3239.119
because there's psychopaths in armies

3237.76 --> 3240.559
all over the place

3239.119 --> 3242.48
right so they might have just gathered

3240.559 --> 3244.88
them up like

3242.48 --> 3245.599
identified them like oh this person

3244.88 --> 3248.2400000000002
seems to have

3245.599 --> 3249.3590000000004
very little objection just murdering the

3248.24 --> 3252.0
entire family and

3249.359 --> 3253.7599999999998
still sleeping the next day they might

3252.0 --> 3256.16
have just gathered up all these people

3253.76 --> 3259.2000000000003
in early armies in the world like

3256.16 --> 3262.319
israel united states china

3259.2 --> 3265.359
turkey everything

3262.319 --> 3266.88
every other country france england and

3265.359 --> 3268.64
australia whatever every

3266.88 --> 3269.92
country that is army and then just like

3268.64 --> 3271.839
okay

3269.92 --> 3273.6800000000003
retire in that army and then come and

3271.839 --> 3276.88
join the freaking eugenics

3273.68 --> 3278.319
execution squad for the world it might

3276.88 --> 3280.96
be out there

3278.319 --> 3281.44
they might just at some point start to

3280.96 --> 3284.4
drop

3281.44 --> 3285.52
in like these weird hovering helicopters

3284.4 --> 3288.96
without

3285.52 --> 3289.68
without wings and just start killing

3288.96 --> 3291.92
everybody

3289.68 --> 3293.04
it might happen and it'll be humans it

3291.92 --> 3296.48
will be humans

3293.04 --> 3298.24
eugenicists scumbag demons with

3296.48 --> 3299.52
high-tech weapons that are just

3298.24 --> 3301.7599999999998
subtly i don't know we're going to

3299.52 --> 3303.599
indiscriminately murder everybody yeah

3301.76 --> 3307.599
that might happen at some point

3303.599 --> 3310.7200000000003
it might

3307.599 --> 3314.88
and when it does i will freaking

3310.72 --> 3317.2
gut them if i get the chance

3314.88 --> 3318.04
because every person in such a group

3317.2 --> 3321.359
needs to be

3318.04 --> 3323.7599999999998
exterminated forever hopefully

3321.359 --> 3325.839
ritually in a way that their soul can

3323.76 --> 3328.7200000000003
never reincarnate ever again if there is

3325.839 --> 3328.72
even such a thing

3329.119 --> 3335.44
they even have any right

3333.28 --> 3337.44
so who knows if that's out there or

3335.44 --> 3340.079
maybe it's not

3337.44 --> 3349.839
maybe it's not i certainly hope it's not

3340.079 --> 3349.8390000000004
but it could be

3355.86 --> 3358.9790000000003
[Music]

3360.839 --> 3363.839
foreign

3365.359 --> 3369.68
your favorite bible teacher my canon is

3368.319 --> 3373.68
punan

3369.68 --> 3376.0
from india awesome man of god

3373.68 --> 3378.3999999999996
no one like him on earth today in my

3376.0 --> 3378.4
opinion

3378.64 --> 3384.8799999999997
okay that sounds

3382.319 --> 3384.88
interesting

3387.599 --> 3390.7200000000003
you did know there is like this big

3390.0 --> 3392.88
temple of

3390.72 --> 3395.1189999999997
of christ right in india it's really

3392.88 --> 3398.48
weird where it is said that

3395.119 --> 3401.76
jesus actually traveled to that and then

3398.48 --> 3404.0
supposedly he died there this always

3401.76 --> 3407.119
mystified me and so he's like

3404.0 --> 3408.72
controversy in the bible but i heard

3407.119 --> 3412.96
that

3408.72 --> 3416.16
i heard that there is this temple

3412.96 --> 3419.119
completely dedicated to christ in

3416.16 --> 3419.7599999999998
india where it is like kind of recorded

3419.119 --> 3421.839
that he

3419.76 --> 3424.559
got there arrived there it's pretty

3421.839 --> 3424.5589999999997
fascinating

3425.04 --> 3429.839
rastarwin no no it's just an indian

3429.04 --> 3433.04
accent

3429.839 --> 3436.319
it's not that special it's really

3433.04 --> 3438.96
easy to do this you know

3436.319 --> 3441.68
it's very very easy to talk like an

3438.96 --> 3441.68
indian person

3442.64 --> 3446.0
and there's a lot of people that

3444.319 --> 3449.599
literally can do that it's

3446.0 --> 3460.24
very easy to mimic an indian accent

3449.599 --> 3463.6800000000003
very very easy

3460.24 --> 3466.8799999999997
it don't has nothing to do with rasta

3463.68 --> 3467.44
a rastaman is is much more difficult as

3466.88 --> 3471.2000000000003
much

3467.44 --> 3474.48
i can't even do it rastafari is

3471.2 --> 3477.839
it's not the same is different

3474.48 --> 3480.96
in donations it's difficult i when i try

3477.839 --> 3482.88
rastafari i usually end up sounding

3480.96 --> 3485.76
weirdly like russian or something it's

3482.88 --> 3488.0
i can't really do it right but indian is

3485.76 --> 3491.28
very easy

3488.0 --> 3491.28
i totally get it

[Music]

3501.52 --> 3506.799
ah oh that's a good question there noah

3503.52 --> 3508.16
justi crazy thought not crazy at all

3506.799 --> 3509.599
something i've been wondering about do

3508.16 --> 3511.839
you think there's a difference between

3509.599 --> 3513.599
sunlight and the actual daylight

3511.839 --> 3515.2
it's different different probably they

3513.599 --> 3517.839
are different they're two completely

3515.2 --> 3517.839
different things

3518.72 --> 3523.839
what you don't speak like that or what

3521.44 --> 3527.359
are you indian territ

3523.839 --> 3530.88
i did not know that well yeah

3527.359 --> 3533.44
but why not

3530.88 --> 3535.76
but yes the sunlight and the daylight

3533.44 --> 3538.2400000000002
are completely different things i agree

3535.76 --> 3539.6800000000003
it's even separated in the freaking

3538.24 --> 3542.16
bible genesis so

3539.68 --> 3544.16
yes daylight is completely something

3542.16 --> 3546.48
else as sunlight

3544.16 --> 3547.839
all the luminary lights are completely

3546.48 --> 3552.079
different from the day

3547.839 --> 3552.0789999999997
light night time cycle

3552.319 --> 3557.68

3561.359 --> 3564.16

3569.92 --> 3574.559
good to know do you actually live in

3572.799 --> 3576.64
india or are you like an

3574.559 --> 3577.59
indian guy in america or something i

3576.64 --> 3579.2799999999997

3577.59 --> 3582.48
[Music]

3579.28 --> 3585.6800000000003
you're more fluent than that

3582.48 --> 3589.28
i know this is just old

3585.68 --> 3592.24
old-fashioned indian accent like before

3589.28 --> 3592.2400000000002
you modernized

3592.72 --> 3597.04
full indian born there too cool

3597.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
it's nice

3606.559 --> 3616.88
you learn something every day

3614.72 --> 3618.24
i don't know man i always pray default

3616.88 --> 3620.4
with everybody think that they're

3618.24 --> 3622.24
american i can't help it it's just like

3620.4 --> 3625.76
i always just think they're american

3622.24 --> 3628.3999999999996
just every time unless they like speak

3625.76 --> 3630.3190000000004
really they use certain type of words

3628.4 --> 3631.76
that only british person

3630.319 --> 3634.24
would and then they assume they're

3631.76 --> 3637.28
british but i just always assume

3634.24 --> 3637.2799999999997
everybody is american

3637.92 --> 3643.839
i don't know why maybe because a lot of

3640.4 --> 3643.839
them are

3647.2 --> 3657.839
american tv shows have shown that indian

3649.92 --> 3657.839
accent i know

3658.96 --> 3662.48
do you know short circuit that's kind of

3661.44 --> 3665.76
where i got the

3662.48 --> 3667.44
silly indian accent from because of the

3665.76 --> 3670.3190000000004
programmer in that that it's

3667.44 --> 3672.16
just very much that accent and we like

3670.319 --> 3676.24
me and my dad always used to make

3672.16 --> 3678.3999999999996
fun with that trying to do that accent

3676.24 --> 3682.24
but seriously in the real world i have

3678.4 --> 3684.48
had people from india on the phone

3682.24 --> 3686.0
scammers in retrospect not saying that

3684.48 --> 3689.92
they all are but that would

3686.0 --> 3692.079
exactly have that accent even worse

3689.92 --> 3694.48
like they would be less capable at

3692.079 --> 3694.48
english

3696.839 --> 3702.96
okay don't know why you needed to say

3700.64 --> 3702.96
that

3706.88 --> 3710.4
i thought short circuit was a pretty

3708.4 --> 3713.6800000000003
funny movie pretty

3710.4 --> 3715.839
interesting in many ways

3713.68 --> 3717.2
it's kind of outdated though but still i

3715.839 --> 3719.7599999999998
thought it was pretty good

3717.2 --> 3721.0389999999998
don't need death to america for that

3719.76 --> 3725.039
come on

3721.039 --> 3728.2400000000002
it's america's right to make

3725.039 --> 3730.7990000000004
like almost racist jokes

3728.24 --> 3733.1189999999997
about other countries accents they have

3730.799 --> 3736.4
the right to do this

3733.119 --> 3739.599
i expect america to do this

3736.4 --> 3742.2400000000002
it just goes because it gives the world

3739.599 --> 3743.2000000000003
an image of how they see the rest of the

3742.24 --> 3745.0389999999998
world

3743.2 --> 3747.1189999999997
it's their right to do this and it's

3745.039 --> 3749.92
real that's how a lot of people do

3747.119 --> 3751.52
think not all of them of course but it's

3749.92 --> 3754.7200000000003
just there

3751.52 --> 3757.839
it's that's america

3754.72 --> 3759.1189999999997
stop being so complainy like do you even

3757.839 --> 3761.44
realize how much

3759.119 --> 3763.039
other countries make fun of americans

3761.44 --> 3764.0
constantly and how dumb they are and all

3763.039 --> 3767.599
that

3764.0 --> 3768.079
so yeah that's normal so america has the

3767.599 --> 3770.96
freaking

3768.079 --> 3774.0
right to have racist accents about

3770.96 --> 3776.88
people from other countries okay

3774.0 --> 3776.88
they have the right

3779.28 --> 3784.4
if you got a squirt over that then go

3781.92 --> 3784.4

3795.039 --> 3800.7200000000003
i don't watch shows especially these

3798.88 --> 3803.119

3800.72 --> 3805.52
i used to watch some cartoons like the

3803.119 --> 3808.88
transformers and all that

3805.52 --> 3825.839
that's about it movies

3808.88 --> 3825.839
sure never really watched any us series

3826.48 --> 3830.96
it's not just how unintelligible they

3828.64 --> 3830.96
sound

3834.24 --> 3839.839
oh yeah yeah the aussie accent they're

3837.039 --> 3839.8390000000004
pretty decent

3840.88 --> 3845.28
it's no good oh they're not good at it

3843.599 --> 3848.319
right okay i'd go with that

3845.28 --> 3852.4
but look these days there's like

3848.319 --> 3855.599
just like all these australian series

3852.4 --> 3858.96
australian they literally use

3855.599 --> 3859.599
australians to do it so yeah if it's

3858.96 --> 3862.7200000000003
like this

3859.599 --> 3865.599
hollywood high rich people

hollywood people with too much money and

3871.92 --> 3875.92
no respect for a life whatsoever

3874.079 --> 3878.48
yeah if they get together and they start

3875.92 --> 3881.839
to do accent it's atrocious

3878.48 --> 3881.839
a true

3883.92 --> 3891.119
yeah i agree i agree

3888.4 --> 3891.119
absolutely

3902.64 --> 3910.5499999999997
liberal demon hollywood people do that

3905.76 --> 3913.7290000000003

3931.52 --> 3935.7599999999998
again zoey or something

3934.0 --> 3937.119
she would always do that sort of thing

3935.76 --> 3939.28
and then be

3937.119 --> 3941.6800000000003
and then be basically scoffed at by the

3939.28 --> 3944.799
others too oh phoebe it's phoebe sorry

3941.68 --> 3946.64
you're right phoebe that's right

3954.4 --> 3957.6800000000003
of made sense

3955.68 --> 3958.96
and sometimes made a lot of sense and

3957.68 --> 3961.68
would freak people out

3958.96 --> 3963.039
i agree it was really funny it was kind

3961.68 --> 3964.3999999999996
of the only thing that i

3963.039 --> 3966.079
thought was good about the series

3964.4 --> 3969.119
because

3966.079 --> 3972.319
friends and how these people

3969.119 --> 3973.6800000000003
deal with one another i'm pretty

3972.319 --> 3975.7599999999998
disgusted by like

3973.68 --> 3977.2
half of the people in that group like

3975.76 --> 3979.28
really disgusted

3977.2 --> 3980.8799999999997
i would like if i'd meet them and they

3979.28 --> 3982.7200000000003
were really like that in the real world

3980.88 --> 3987.119
i would literally spit on the ground and

3982.72 --> 3990.16
say you are [ __ ] disgusting scumbags

3987.119 --> 3992.4
because i do feel like that like

3990.16 --> 3994.3999999999996
the way they act they're absolutely

3992.4 --> 3998.319
disgusting scumbags

3994.4 --> 4001.599
half of them like really repulsive

3998.319 --> 4006.88
i did not like friends that much

4001.599 --> 4009.119
probably get that

4006.88 --> 4011.28
and i absolutely decided oh wait no

4009.119 --> 4021.839
that's another series

4011.28 --> 4021.8390000000004
never mind it's not relevant

4022.88 --> 4028.4
like this chad all right well it's nice

4025.839 --> 4031.599
to have you mac hannan

4028.4 --> 4034.319
people are nice yeah yeah

4031.599 --> 4036.1600000000003
i know except sometimes there's just

4034.319 --> 4037.839
this

4036.16 --> 4039.44
you know and it's people that have been

4037.839 --> 4040.0789999999997
here for a long time you know is that

4039.44 --> 4042.16
tapi's

4040.079 --> 4043.44
been following my show for like at least

4042.16 --> 4045.44
three years

4043.44 --> 4047.359
but when he then thinks like he has the

4045.44 --> 4048.0
right to basically tell me i'm jumping

4047.359 --> 4051.5989999999997
the gun and

4048.0 --> 4054.64
[ __ ] and disrespecting me

4051.599 --> 4056.1600000000003
not correcting me in a in a yeah in a

4054.64 --> 4058.0
reasonable fashion

4056.16 --> 4059.5989999999997
and then doubles down on it then i kick

4058.0 --> 4060.72
them you know even if they've been here

4059.599 --> 4062.079
for three years

4060.72 --> 4063.52
it's not the first time by the way i

4062.079 --> 4064.559
kicked september before that kind of

4063.52 --> 4066.16
behavior

4064.559 --> 4067.6800000000003
eventually it you know when they

4066.16 --> 4070.5589999999997
approach me in other chats and say like

4067.68 --> 4073.2
ah can i be unbanned again

4070.559 --> 4075.119
and they have the right tone in their

4073.2 --> 4077.2
voices weird because it's all text but i

4075.119 --> 4080.559
can feel that from how they say it

4077.2 --> 4082.64
and i'll bend them again eventually

4080.559 --> 4083.76
because i don't hold grudges it's just

4082.64 --> 4085.7599999999998
about the behavior

4083.76 --> 4087.039
and yeah when somebody's doubling down

4085.76 --> 4088.96
on that behavior

4087.039 --> 4090.48
that i do not accept in my chat then i

4088.96 --> 4093.52
will ban them

4090.48 --> 4093.52
it's just the way it is

4101.6 --> 4105.6
israel in contact with the galactic

4104.159 --> 4108.96
federation yeah yeah

4105.6 --> 4110.88
well they invented it so that doesn't

4108.96 --> 4113.759
surprise me at all

4110.88 --> 4115.839
you know it's their little fantastical

4113.759 --> 4119.359
realm

4115.839 --> 4121.5199999999995
it's their narnia they they wrote that

4119.359 --> 4123.359
they designed that they have the people

4121.52 --> 4126.159000000001
in place to actually

4123.359 --> 4128.0
play that game with the world i'm pretty

4126.159 --> 4133.839
sure it's israel that does that

4128.0 --> 4133.839
ah deal with it

4143.199 --> 4146.48
and i'm fine with that it's all very

4144.96 --> 4148.2390000000005
cute it's cool why not

4146.48 --> 4149.839
you know it's cool story i like the idea

4148.239 --> 4152.4
oh this is outer space and it's a

4149.839 --> 4154.239
galactic federation and they're all

4152.4 --> 4155.5199999999995
looking at earth like how are we going

4154.239 --> 4157.839
to evolve

4155.52 --> 4159.040000000001
and in the meantime we have to deal with

4157.839 --> 4161.04
the eu genesis

4159.04 --> 4162.48
because this is basically a standoff

4161.04 --> 4166.319
between

4162.48 --> 4168.3189999999995
free humanity and the eugenics cult

4166.319 --> 4169.4400000000005
that's what this is that's where we are

4168.319 --> 4171.759
now

4169.44 --> 4173.599999999999
and the eugenics cult will use any kind

4171.759 --> 4173.92
of method to try and convince us that

4173.6 --> 4176.799
they

4173.92 --> 4178.719
are correct and that all must be done to

4176.799 --> 4182.08
fulfill their goal or everything

4178.719 --> 4185.04
everything must be sacrificed literally

4182.08 --> 4186.88
literally sacrificed on an altar of

4185.04 --> 4189.359
ireland on death

4186.88 --> 4191.839
sacrifice so that the eugenics goal is

4189.359 --> 4193.92
met that is their only goal

4191.839 --> 4194.96
and they will do anything make up any

4193.92 --> 4197.4400000000005
story

4194.96 --> 4198.4
manipulate to any degree in order to

4197.44 --> 4200.159
achieve that

4198.4 --> 4202.48
so that is what we all face as free

4200.159 --> 4205.5199999999995
humanity eugenics

4202.48 --> 4209.919999999999
is the main enemy of free humanity

4205.52 --> 4211.280000000001
like that supersedes even the concept of

4209.92 --> 4214.56
globalism and all that

4211.28 --> 4215.599999999999
and nationalism it's eugenics eugenics

4214.56 --> 4218.8
is the main

4215.6 --> 4221.6
ideological enemy of free humanity

4218.8 --> 4222.56
and it is world encompassing it's

4221.6 --> 4224.2390000000005
everywhere

4222.56 --> 4226.88
and there's a lot of people that are

4224.239 --> 4231.839999999999
have been indoctrinated in this

4226.88 --> 4231.84
they are the it's the main challenge

4247.679 --> 4251.52

4249.84 --> 4254.719
it is the main goal

4251.52 --> 4257.4400000000005
the main goal is depopulation

4254.719 --> 4258.0
to insanely low levels because they

4257.44 --> 4261.5199999999995
think it

4258.0 --> 4263.52
is effective but they should know better

4261.52 --> 4265.6
they should know better they should know

4263.52 --> 4267.4400000000005
that everything actually functions

4265.6 --> 4269.04
because there are this many people

4267.44 --> 4270.639999999999
even though there are a lot of freaking

4269.04 --> 4273.12
demons out there also making it

4270.64 --> 4276.0
miserable for everyone

4273.12 --> 4277.12
right if you take those away not that we

4276.0 --> 4280.159
that i'm saying that we

4277.12 --> 4282.32
should literally do that physically

4280.159 --> 4284.719
that stops then everything will be

4282.32 --> 4287.599999999999
amazingly smooth

4284.719 --> 4289.199
and if you all cut it down to like this

4287.6 --> 4291.1990000000005
crazy

4289.199 --> 4294.239
few like five percent or whatever of

4291.199 --> 4297.96
what exists now

4294.239 --> 4301.28
then it all collapses

4297.96 --> 4304.4
everything collapses absolute

4301.28 --> 4306.4
world encompassing disaster everything

4304.4 --> 4309.28
will die

4306.4 --> 4311.199
because it cannot function anymore with

4309.28 --> 4312.88
too little people

4311.199 --> 4315.599999999999
in a situation where also everything

4312.88 --> 4318.8
will be extremely demoralized because of

4315.6 --> 4319.76
all the loss and it will die everything

4318.8 --> 4324.08
will be destroyed

4319.76 --> 4324.08
everything will go back to people just

4324.719 --> 4331.12
living in a forest

4328.08 --> 4331.84
maybe some farmers will be left that's

4331.12 --> 4334.48
it

4331.84 --> 4336.159000000001
everything else will we die it will die

4334.48 --> 4339.36
there will be no more cities

4336.159 --> 4341.44
no more trade no more craft

4339.36 --> 4343.759999999999
no more factories nothing it will all

4341.44 --> 4347.199
die no more electricity because

4343.76 --> 4349.1990000000005
if all these people are gone then who's

4347.199 --> 4351.12
going to repair the machines who's going

4349.199 --> 4352.4
to repair the computers who's going to

4351.12 --> 4356.4
keep it running

4352.4 --> 4358.719
nobody will it will all die

4356.4 --> 4360.719
everything everything we've ever known

4358.719 --> 4363.28
all the civilization everything all the

4360.719 --> 4367.28
developments since the 1900s

4363.28 --> 4369.5199999999995
will all go away forever

4367.28 --> 4371.44
because there will not be enough people

4369.52 --> 4373.679
to keep it all running anymore

4371.44 --> 4374.799999999999
it will all go away everything so this

4373.679 --> 4376.719
idea

4374.8 --> 4378.719
that the eu genesis even tried to

4376.719 --> 4379.84
project on their followers like oh if we

4378.719 --> 4382.4
just all kill

4379.84 --> 4384.32
enough people then we will have

4382.4 --> 4386.4
everything to ourselves

4384.32 --> 4387.92
yeah that's a pipe dream because you

4386.4 --> 4390.639999999999
will literally have

4387.92 --> 4391.52
nothing nothing will be left there might

4390.64 --> 4393.6
be some stuff

4391.52 --> 4394.64
in storage that you can use maybe even

4393.6 --> 4396.719
for 100 years

4394.64 --> 4398.320000000001
but there will be no production there

4396.719 --> 4401.199
will be no development

4398.32 --> 4403.04
there will be no updates and eventually

4401.199 --> 4404.4
there will be no electricity because

4403.04 --> 4406.0
nobody's there to run it

4404.4 --> 4408.879999999999
and you can't automate it because

4406.0 --> 4411.6
automation requires people to maintain

4408.88 --> 4413.76
the systems that keep it running and

4411.6 --> 4415.92
there won't be any

4413.76 --> 4417.360000000001
there will be nothing nothing will be

4415.92 --> 4420.4
left it will all

4417.36 --> 4422.799999999999
be destroyed by the erosion of time

4420.4 --> 4424.639999999999
everything and we will be back to square

4422.8 --> 4426.64
one that is what happens if the

4424.64 --> 4430.320000000001
eugenicists win

4426.64 --> 4433.4400000000005
do you understand absolutely it will i

4430.32 --> 4437.04
guarantee it i guarantee it

4433.44 --> 4437.04
there is no way

4437.28 --> 4440.5599999999995
that their pipe dream about the end

4440.0 --> 4442.48
result

4440.56 --> 4443.679
is going to unfold the way that they

4442.48 --> 4445.839999999999
hope it is

4443.679 --> 4447.84
impossible it is a physical

4445.84 --> 4451.6
impossibility

4447.84 --> 4454.2390000000005
what happens instead everything will die

4451.6 --> 4456.64
every development all the technology all

4454.239 --> 4459.199
the convenience every little detail

4456.64 --> 4461.1990000000005
it will all go away and it will not be

4459.199 --> 4463.12
able to come back

4461.199 --> 4464.4
not for a long time maybe like in a

4463.12 --> 4469.76
couple of hundred years

4464.4 --> 4471.759999999999
it might

4469.76 --> 4472.88
yeah that's very cute faye decker it's

4471.76 --> 4476.159000000001
all very cute

4472.88 --> 4479.679
yeah yeah but without any of that

4476.159 --> 4481.199
you will not have computers you will not

4479.679 --> 4483.4400000000005
have plumbing

4481.199 --> 4484.96
you will have no have no kitchen

4483.44 --> 4489.44
appliances

4484.96 --> 4492.4
at all you will not have heat

4489.44 --> 4493.839999999999
there will be nothing there will be

4492.4 --> 4497.839999999999
nothing left

4493.84 --> 4499.76
you understand oh who needs computers

4497.84 --> 4500.96
well you need a computer you need a

4499.76 --> 4504.719
computer to

4500.96 --> 4504.719
say that in my chat right now

4506.96 --> 4511.6
without a computer you wouldn't even

4508.56 --> 4513.92
know my show was going

4511.6 --> 4515.76
oh you don't well okay well then get the

4513.92 --> 4517.52
[ __ ] out

4515.76 --> 4525.84
you don't need a computer so you don't

4517.52 --> 4525.84
need to be here so get the [ __ ] out

4530.239 --> 4539.839999999999
it's the most [ __ ] argument i've

4531.92 --> 4539.84
ever heard

4549.73 --> 4556.639999999999
[Music]

4552.48 --> 4556.639999999999
oh virus what are you doing here

4557.36 --> 4562.5599999999995
you know i don't entertain coriolis

4560.0 --> 4567.84
virus victims right

4562.56 --> 4567.84
i'm not gonna entertain that

4570.64 --> 4574.88
i just happen to be up okie dokie

4575.12 --> 4581.5199999999995
make sure you join the discord over at

4578.84 --> 4585.360000000001
nathan's

4581.52 --> 4588.8
you are a virus you're immune okay

4585.36 --> 4591.44
well that's cute but because actual

4588.8 --> 4594.08
viruses don't exist

4591.44 --> 4595.36
right you do realize that right terrain

4594.08 --> 4598.08
theory

4595.36 --> 4598.96
virus theory is debunked doesn't

4598.08 --> 4600.8
actually work

4598.96 --> 4602.4
it's terrain theory is a more plausible

4600.8 --> 4606.0
alternative

4602.4 --> 4607.44
that can be proven yeah so

4606.0 --> 4609.76
yeah that's really cute you are the

4607.44 --> 4613.12
virus that means you don't exist

4609.76 --> 4616.159000000001
just saying you have no problem with

4613.12 --> 4616.159
that okay that's fine

4616.56 --> 4625.4400000000005
just so you know you don't exist

4623.08 --> 4628.719
[Music]

4625.44 --> 4637.839999999999
you're just an echo of a notion

4628.719 --> 4637.84
of an idea that's been disproved

4639.76 --> 4643.04
no you're not my imagination i don't

4641.84 --> 4648.719
imagine

4643.04 --> 4648.719
you i imagine things that interest me

4648.84 --> 4651.84
more

4663.36 --> 4667.92
is free energy a possibility nope

4670.0 --> 4676.8
not really can be a lot of

4673.36 --> 4678.32
easy energy though and it is never free

4676.8 --> 4679.84
it's impossible it's physically

4678.32 --> 4681.599999999999
impossible and it is always going to

4679.84 --> 4685.1990000000005
come from somewhere

4681.6 --> 4685.84
now there is an incredible amount of

4685.199 --> 4690.5599999999995
energy

4685.84 --> 4692.159000000001
available but it's never free

4690.56 --> 4694.4800000000005
and that doesn't mean that oh that means

4692.159 --> 4698.08
that all the energy has to be

4694.48 --> 4700.959999999999
made by fossil fuels and all no no no no

4698.08 --> 4702.48
there's definitely electrostatic energy

4700.96 --> 4705.52
in the air

4702.48 --> 4706.4
like tesla recognized this right it's

4705.52 --> 4708.0
there

4706.4 --> 4709.5199999999995
but that doesn't mean that you we can

4708.0 --> 4712.0
all just start erecting

4709.52 --> 4714.080000000001
towers everywhere to start tapping into

4712.0 --> 4716.08
this without consequences

4714.08 --> 4717.28
because there will be consequences

4716.08 --> 4718.8
always is

4717.28 --> 4720.5599999999995
because that energy is going to come

4718.8 --> 4722.4800000000005
from something it's going to be

4720.56 --> 4725.84
detracted from something

4722.48 --> 4727.919999999999
what will that do well i've speculated

4725.84 --> 4730.159000000001
speculated mind you i don't have proof

4727.92 --> 4731.52
i've never seen it tested but i have a

4730.159 --> 4733.5199999999995
great suspicion

4731.52 --> 4735.6
that if that would happen if a certain

4733.52 --> 4738.320000000001
region say a big city

4735.6 --> 4740.2390000000005
would start to suddenly erect all these

4738.32 --> 4742.48
energy gathering towers that like

4740.239 --> 4743.919999999999
reach up for like three miles or

4742.48 --> 4747.199
something and it's like every

4743.92 --> 4748.719
big spikes everywhere big big spikes

4747.199 --> 4752.08
like towering

4748.719 --> 4753.92
even above the the big buildings

4752.08 --> 4756.239
and you'd see these big spikes that were

4753.92 --> 4759.679
literally tapping into the energy

4756.239 --> 4760.959999999999
above and then turn that into appliance

4759.679 --> 4762.96
energy right

4760.96 --> 4764.0
that might be a possibility that that

4762.96 --> 4767.04
can be done

4764.0 --> 4769.04
but i suspect that this would not be

4767.04 --> 4771.84
without consequences because

4769.04 --> 4773.44
i've suspected for some time that the

4771.84 --> 4776.719
celestial lights

4773.44 --> 4779.759999999999
including the sunlight actually

4776.719 --> 4782.88
utilizes this electrical energy

4779.76 --> 4786.400000000001
locally so that if you then start to

4782.88 --> 4788.400000000001
tap into it and detract from it

4786.4 --> 4790.4
for your electrical appliances and all

4788.4 --> 4793.5199999999995
that that it would

4790.4 --> 4794.239
effectively dim down the celestial light

4793.52 --> 4797.6
output

4794.239 --> 4800.239
there in that specific space where those

4797.6 --> 4801.92
energy energy is tapped that could

4800.239 --> 4802.718999999999
potentially mean that if you have all

4801.92 --> 4807.28
these things up

4802.719 --> 4809.6
detracting energy that the sun would dim

4807.28 --> 4811.36
in that specific region specifically

4809.6 --> 4813.280000000001
there not around it

4811.36 --> 4815.44
there's no spikes tapping energy then it

4813.28 --> 4818.48
won't be dimmed in that location

4815.44 --> 4819.28
and if there are then yeah the sun might

4818.48 --> 4820.959999999999
like be

4819.28 --> 4822.96
half strength and that might have all

4820.96 --> 4826.2390000000005
kinds of crazy consequences

4822.96 --> 4828.88
like maybe it would start to freeze

4826.239 --> 4829.919999999999
because all that electricity is being

4828.88 --> 4832.2390000000005
tapped into

4829.92 --> 4833.28
and then the sun cannot utilize it

4832.239 --> 4836.159
anymore

4833.28 --> 4838.8
whatever it is to output the light

4836.159 --> 4842.4
energy to warm everything up

4838.8 --> 4847.84
see that is how i've imagined it

4842.4 --> 4847.839999999999
to work at this point

4848.08 --> 4853.04
all right hey guns have never run rmp

4850.32 --> 4853.04
good to see you

4858.88 --> 4863.679
matt mccann and come on this is a kumu

4860.96 --> 4867.84
virus you're talking to

4863.679 --> 4871.36
you know he is an absolute global zealot

4867.84 --> 4874.2390000000005
beyond redemption this guy will never

4871.36 --> 4875.5199999999995
never admit the earth is not a globe

4874.239 --> 4878.32
ever

4875.52 --> 4878.96
he'd rather be executed i suspect than

4878.32 --> 4881.44
go there

4878.96 --> 4883.679
ever like he will literally if he's the

4881.44 --> 4884.32
only one left in the world that lives in

4883.679 --> 4886.88
the globe

4884.32 --> 4889.12
then he will remain believing in the

4886.88 --> 4890.56
globe even if everybody else he knows

4889.12 --> 4892.48
that believes in the globe tells him

4890.56 --> 4894.080000000001
wait it's not a globe after all even if

4892.48 --> 4895.199
rump has told him look dude you got to

4894.08 --> 4898.239
give this up

4895.199 --> 4899.12
he will never stop see he's even

4898.239 --> 4901.44
admitting it he

4899.12 --> 4904.0
is a religious fanatic he cannot be

4901.44 --> 4906.799999999999
convinced no matter what you say no

4904.0 --> 4909.36
no preponderance of reason will ever

4906.8 --> 4913.1990000000005
make him change his mind and he knows it

4909.36 --> 4914.799999999999
which is really creepy by the way dude

4913.199 --> 4916.48
because you're literally now just

4914.8 --> 4919.76
confessing yes i am

4916.48 --> 4922.959999999999
insane only

4919.76 --> 4924.719
insane nothing can convince you the

4922.96 --> 4928.32
earth is not a globe

4924.719 --> 4930.08
that includes all reason all evidence

4928.32 --> 4932.5599999999995
you are literally confessing you're

4930.08 --> 4932.5599999999995
insane

4932.8 --> 4936.639
but that's fine you can call that

4935.199 --> 4939.919999999999
reality if you like

4936.639 --> 4943.52
it's not though it's just your delusion

4939.92 --> 4946.639
right right nw dude

4943.52 --> 4948.719
yeah i'm definitely feeling a lot better

4946.639 --> 4950.400000000001
although yeah i was sick like weeks ago

4948.719 --> 4953.36
so that's been a while you know i've

4950.4 --> 4954.879999999999
been up and running a new show to our

4953.36 --> 4958.4
show these days for

4954.88 --> 4962.8
almost two weeks now is it two weeks

4958.4 --> 4962.799999999999
i don't know
