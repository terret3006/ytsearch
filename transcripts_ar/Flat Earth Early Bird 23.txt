2.439 --> 9.11
good morning

4.75 --> 12.92
this is Flat Earth early-bird number 23

9.11 --> 15.98
I'm your host Arwen today and starting

12.92 --> 19.04
out with no guests but maybe somebody

15.98 --> 23.119
will come and join pretty soon so hello

19.04 --> 25.7
everyone it's been quiet in chat so far

23.119 --> 31.669
but I did kind of start up pretty late

25.7 --> 32.21
so but started in time I see Alan be in

31.669 --> 35.86
chat

32.21 --> 42.85
Asura and righteous force good morning

35.86 --> 46.22
so I kind of like the way the show ended

42.85 --> 51.02
yesterday and I wish that could kind of

46.22 --> 55.339999999999996
be from start instead of me just staring

51.02 --> 56.720000000000006
at chat and trying to interact that way

55.34 --> 59.06
because it's kind of slow

56.72 --> 63.829
although yeah yesterday's hangout was

59.06 --> 66.82000000000001
pretty okay plenty of uses so though

63.829 --> 66.82000000000001
Oliver Farney

79.509 --> 87.039
oh yeah you know what I kind of forgot

84.729 --> 89.32
to talk about yes it's just like a weird

87.039 --> 94.81
little thing that happened it's kind of

89.32 --> 98.47
funny and but it was it happened not

94.81 --> 101.07900000000001
yesterday night but the day before in in

98.47 --> 103.929
the evening and I went down the

101.079 --> 106.689
staircase in the evening was dark and

103.929 --> 109.36
like as soon as I stepped in there and

106.689 --> 115.02999999999999
it's pretty much one giant open

109.36 --> 118.24
staircase there was just this mouse just

115.03 --> 121.06
like trying to hide there like on the

118.24 --> 125.649
side on the rock on these stone floors

121.06 --> 128.709
like okay that's something you don't see

125.649 --> 131.44
every day a mouse like there's lots of

128.709 --> 136.06
cats walking around but a mouse was like

131.44 --> 140.019
okay how did you get there and yeah kind

136.06 --> 142.989
of yeah I'm not aggressive to vermin at

140.019 --> 145.45000000000002
all unless they look really disgusting

142.989 --> 147.97
and aggressive acting and everything but

145.45 --> 148.6
this was just a regular house mouse it

147.97 --> 153.069
looked pretty

148.6 --> 154.78
okay now not all to scuffie but he was

153.069 --> 158.98
really nervous at my presence I like

154.78 --> 162.67
okay maybe if I just like stand a little

158.98 --> 165.459
bit more walk on the outer side of the

162.67 --> 168.01
building I'll walk past that maybe not

165.459 --> 170.29
to start off but yeah he absolutely said

168.01 --> 171.97
to me and he just tried to sneak away

170.29 --> 176.67999999999998
around the corner try to get out of

171.97 --> 179.38
sight but yeah I then accelerated my

176.68 --> 183.22
attempt like okay maybe if I just move

179.38 --> 186.549
past and quickly he'll be compelled to

183.22 --> 188.799
walk the other way at least and yeah I'm

186.549 --> 192.16
not being chasing him around but yeah he

188.799 --> 195.09900000000002
just then suddenly burst it off like

192.16 --> 197.29
running down the staircase

195.099 --> 200.47
and then he took a shortcut at the

197.29 --> 203.85899999999998
corner and basically right in front of

200.47 --> 207.13
my face that he just jumped and I

203.859 --> 208.989
thought okay Youth sure that safe and

207.13 --> 212.82999999999998
she little rush there and yeah I looked

208.989 --> 217.36
down at squat and I thought oh

212.83 --> 220.87
[ __ ] oh [ __ ] I looked down and yeah

217.36 --> 223.72000000000003
there was a mouse lying there no blood

220.87 --> 225.76
splatter I was like oh [ __ ]

223.72 --> 228.63
he's probably in bad shape so yeah I

225.76 --> 230.23
walked all the way down which is three

228.63 --> 234.1
stories high

230.23 --> 235.51
one giant hole in the in between the

234.1 --> 238.66
staircase yeah you could technically

235.51 --> 241.09
fall over the rail and ya get really

238.66 --> 244.03
seriously hurt or dead yeah the mouse

241.09 --> 246.34
just jumped down all the way to the

244.03 --> 249.31
bottom on the hearthstone floor and I

246.34 --> 252.19
went down and yeah he was still kind of

249.31 --> 254.95
moving but he was very barely moving not

252.19 --> 257.01
really moving around so it's like oh my

254.95 --> 260.5
god you actually survived the impact

257.01 --> 267.52
it's little creatures of such resilience

260.5 --> 269.23
physically and I thought okay well he he

267.52 --> 271.75
started to respond a little bit more and

269.23 --> 273.67
more so I was like okay what I'm gonna

271.75 --> 275.2
do yeah I could try to pick him up he's

273.67 --> 278.38
probably gonna panic and get a heart

275.2 --> 280.75
attack yeah even though I would like to

278.38 --> 283.57
put him outside or something so he eyed

280.75 --> 285.13
properly find a hole or whatever anyway

283.57 --> 288.04
it's not the staircase it's not the

285.13 --> 290.86
place for a mouse but yeah he sneaked

288.04 --> 294.31
away in the corner and later when I came

290.86 --> 299.77000000000004
back nothing Hauer later he was gone so

294.31 --> 300.64
he actually survived that that was

299.77 --> 303.28
pretty astounding

300.64 --> 305.97999999999996
so nature that's yeah one of these

303.28 --> 311.04999999999995
little experiences after two days ago

305.98 --> 313.33000000000004
was weird and I have all kinds of

311.05 --> 316.93
encounters with animals in that sense I

313.33 --> 319.27
don't know maybe it's just because I

316.93 --> 322.45
really pay attention to them as I would

319.27 --> 326.59
pay attention to the potential depths of

322.45 --> 333.88
a person so I really look at them like

326.59 --> 337.27
how are they yeah but a mouse in the in

333.88 --> 340.56
the flat apartment staircase something

337.27 --> 340.56
you don't see any everyday

341.199 --> 347.71000000000004
we do get a lot of exotic parrots or

344.289 --> 351.729
just like a heart of green parrots that

347.71 --> 355.02
are squeaking and flying around yeah

351.729 --> 358.06
they day and nights are usually evening

355.02 --> 359.62
but during the summer especially but

358.06 --> 367.3
also during the winter they just keep

359.62 --> 369.49
them perfectly a horde of released

367.3 --> 374.259
parrots that have gathered over the

369.49 --> 377.49
years and actually managed to yeah

374.259 --> 380.969
to survive on their own as a as a group

377.49 --> 388.68
they've been there for over a decade

380.969 --> 396.46
it's funny so more people joined to see

388.68 --> 403.169
Nicholas and ajm Jessa combi right so

396.46 --> 403.169
hey if anyone wants to dive in you know

403.229 --> 410.889
he's in their age cool nice for you to

408.129 --> 413.77000000000004
join hey it's in there if you want to

410.889 --> 415.99
get on the panel add me on skype it's

413.77 --> 419.83
kind of their requirement I'm not gonna

415.99 --> 422.129
put link public here all the trolls and

419.83 --> 425.68
I don't have the security set of us

422.129 --> 430.509
that's Nathan s so what yeah if you want

425.68 --> 432.909
to join add me on skype and I can send

430.509 --> 435.879
you a hang of me otherwise so yeah

432.909 --> 445.149
welcome to the chat the flutters early

435.879 --> 449.589
bird shows its Paul yeah what's with

445.149 --> 453.069
Nathan's perspective thing well what's

449.589 --> 458.62
with it is that it's really important

453.069 --> 462.279
cause ballers use the workings of

458.62 --> 466.629
perspective and camouflage its functions

462.279 --> 469.36
and portray the results of these

466.629 --> 472.959
functions as though it were physically

469.36 --> 474.72900000000004
literal yeah using all kinds of

472.959 --> 477.849
mathematical trickery and

474.729 --> 484.99
a graphic view which ya doesn't you

477.849 --> 488.43899999999996
can't the effects of real vision of 3d

484.99 --> 490.089
vision cannot have effects side effects

488.439 --> 490.719
that are provable you can test them

490.089 --> 497.199
yourself

490.719 --> 499.539
that cannot be literally demonstrated in

497.199 --> 505.21000000000004
an orthographic view these functions

499.539 --> 507.639
will not yeah that you can't show it you

505.21 --> 511.74899999999997
can't show it through the diagram you

507.639 --> 513.909
can only describe it so that's up with

511.749 --> 517.529
perspective that's why we're talking

513.909 --> 517.529
about it for two months now

532.38 --> 538.03
all right okay Oliver Forney that's a

536.35 --> 540.4
very very good question

538.03 --> 542.53
what do you think scientists will claim

540.4 --> 544.93
when flood or turn out to be true with

542.53 --> 547.36
people like Neil deGrasse Tyson claimed

544.93 --> 551.68
ignorance what should their punishment

547.36 --> 555.97
for misleading people well it's very

551.68 --> 560.7399999999999
interesting I guess I could say that

555.97 --> 563.6800000000001
I've seen what happened when what

560.74 --> 566.77
happened is they will claim yeah we were

563.68 --> 570.31
just working according to the principles

566.77 --> 572.46
we were just presupposing and well it

570.31 --> 575.04
turned out not to be true

572.46 --> 580.5400000000001
they will claim innocence and

575.04 --> 584.3499999999999
technically they will be correct you

580.54 --> 589.39
judicially in that sense so on the other

584.35 --> 592.48
hand they're the real optical clarity of

589.39 --> 595.51
the studio works for the space stuff

592.48 --> 599.44
that's something else but that can

595.51 --> 601.74
easily be thrown on government

599.44 --> 606.73
manipulation with an agenda that will

601.74 --> 608.29
required to exist it as they will say to

606.73 --> 612.1
keep things stable under the

608.29 --> 615.91
circumstances so they too will have a

612.1 --> 618.16
cover government purpose what they're

615.91 --> 622.6
doing is just like why do secret surfers

618.16 --> 624.76
manipulate and place lies sometimes now

622.6 --> 626.38
it's like really bad but even in the old

624.76 --> 628.83
days they did that with a specific

626.38 --> 631.99
agenda and they would be tolerated for

628.83 --> 633.61
eventually being revealed as Liars in

631.99 --> 635.2
what they said because they did it for

633.61 --> 638.32
that purpose and that kind of

635.2 --> 641.4100000000001
construction will be put forward so

638.32 --> 643.9300000000001
judicially defend the NASA the real

641.41 --> 646.93
studio set up people that are working on

643.93 --> 650.2299999999999
that because it's done for common

646.93 --> 652.3599999999999
purpose and more people that are talkers

650.23 --> 655.4200000000001
that are like the faces you know

652.36 --> 657.76
deGrasse Tyson all these people they

655.42 --> 660.9599999999999
will just say yeah look I just followed

657.76 --> 663.49
the rules of science and yeah

660.96 --> 665.82
technically it is presupposition of what

663.49 --> 668.05
what do you got to do you know

665.82 --> 669.73
that's what people they will say that's

668.05 --> 672.55
what people like to talk about and

669.73 --> 674.9200000000001
they're correct of course conditions

672.55 --> 678.0089999999999
into society but yeah technically it's

674.92 --> 680.5889999999999
correct and well when things change the

678.009 --> 683.44
game is just up when the people see

680.589 --> 685.74
through it it's just up and they will

683.44 --> 688.5400000000001
just claim yeah we were just doing what

685.74 --> 692.019
we were doing on own nefarious thing we

688.54 --> 693.819
just yeah we love the concept we love

692.019 --> 696.37
thinking about me we love the ball on

693.819 --> 697.66
space and all science fiction so why not

696.37 --> 700.6
and yeah

697.66 --> 709.06
that will probably work so don't expect

700.6 --> 716.62
any serious punishment no and I don't

709.06 --> 719.7399999999999
know if look even if that earth would be

716.62 --> 724.019
declassified and say that government

719.74 --> 725.699
will be very harsh against these globe

724.019 --> 729.3100000000001
proponents the ones that's been

725.699 --> 731.769
upholding it that's gonna hurt Globus

729.31 --> 735.9399999999999
like the real globe believers the ones

731.769 --> 739.18
that refuse to accept the change they

735.94 --> 742.5400000000001
will be really really hurt by that it's

739.18 --> 745.51
like an insult a religious attack they

742.54 --> 747.639
will see it like they will be more

745.51 --> 751.3
inclined to see like flat earthers are

747.639 --> 752.86
actually a religious ideology group that

751.3 --> 757.029
are trying to conquer the world and now

752.86 --> 760.779
attacking the opponent them so it'll

757.029 --> 764.05
only play into like a social war a

760.779 --> 768.3
principled war that is gonna be shitty

764.05 --> 771.189
and missing and so punishment is no

768.3 --> 773.41
let's just come to an understanding

771.189 --> 777.5999999999999
that's basically what it's all about so

773.41 --> 780.16
don't get aggressive don't be vengeful

777.6 --> 785.259
because it's it's only gonna make things

780.16 --> 788.139
worse we got to think about who's here

785.259 --> 792.1
how they all have to deal with the

788.139 --> 795.01
transition and just make it the world a

792.1 --> 797.62
good place as good as possible for as

795.01 --> 800.01
many people as possible that's how I

797.62 --> 805.12
like to see

800.01 --> 808.26
goody two-shoes as they say that says so

805.12 --> 811.54
no I don't think this should be punished

808.26 --> 814.96
maybe they should be ridiculed through

811.54 --> 818.23
comedy and I bet you as soon as flatter

814.96 --> 820.9000000000001
it becomes reclassified the comedy scene

818.23 --> 823.21
will be making fun of space all over the

820.9 --> 826.23
place so much so much in your face

823.21 --> 828.9100000000001
probably eventually because it works

826.23 --> 832.1800000000001
that people will even become sick of it

828.91 --> 834.49
it's like yeah yeah we know now how this

832.18 --> 836.9499999999999
place is fake so stupid people will even

834.49 --> 840.46
get sick of it when bombarded by the

836.95 --> 842.47
media enough and hey media's just gonna

840.46 --> 845.02
be on the winning side they just want

842.47 --> 847.1800000000001
the viewer so a suddenly society

845.02 --> 849.49
switches then they will just go with the

847.18 --> 851.41
switch even though they're completely

849.49 --> 854.4300000000001
contradicting everything they've been

851.41 --> 857.26
saying before that that's how that works

854.43 --> 862.3599999999999
especially for the domain lyst

857.26 --> 869.73
of stream media so that's my forecast of

862.36 --> 869.73
what will happen and it's better just

870.39 --> 877.93
you know it's not entirely over yet even

875.47 --> 882.1
even if there would be a societal

877.93 --> 884.9499999999999
transition because then the seduction

882.1 --> 888.1
phase which happened earlier is how it

884.95 --> 891.01
came into the entire society will to

888.1 --> 894.28
start over again they have to inspire

891.01 --> 896.89
people or announce something incredible

894.28 --> 900.55
get people caught up in it until they're

896.89 --> 902.74
fully reinfect in the dream again that

900.55 --> 906.13
space is real and you must be mistaken

902.74 --> 909.25
because food is so incredible there and

906.13 --> 916.72
they could do that so we have to be very

909.25 --> 919.15
careful as to what their countermove is

916.72 --> 922.1800000000001
because they're likely to be

919.15 --> 923.92
countermoves and not even necessarily by

922.18 --> 926.41
the main people that we see now like

923.92 --> 929.65
neil degrasse tyson or whatever but like

926.41 --> 931.5699999999999
subtly really amazing new people that

929.65 --> 932.17
we've never heard of might just pop out

931.57 --> 941.46
you know

932.17 --> 944.29
and just through refined and pop-culture

941.46 --> 948.52
thinking and just social engineering

944.29 --> 951.1899999999999
managed to get everyone on to the

948.52 --> 953.56
adventure that wagon again and maybe

951.19 --> 954.94
even at first say that's just a fantasy

953.56 --> 957.01
it's alright

954.94 --> 959.94
but if you start out saying it's a fancy

957.01 --> 963.27
people just alcohol but if they jump

959.94 --> 968.83
hang on long enough they might

963.27 --> 971.47
accidentally slip into believing that

968.83 --> 975.64
it's actually real again that happens it

971.47 --> 978.94
happened to me in the past that you just

975.64 --> 981.22
start to believe it again it all depends

978.94 --> 983.59
on the average guard person has of

981.22 --> 985.75
course look.we the flat earthers that

983.59 --> 987.96
are dealing with this yet we have so

985.75 --> 992.47
build up so much defense so much guards

987.96 --> 994.6
extremely unlikely to slip into leaving

992.47 --> 997.57
the ball again but that's not the same

994.6 --> 999.52
for the general public they're not that

997.57 --> 1002.9100000000001
strengthened in their defenses so they

999.52 --> 1006.39
may just like oh look

1002.91 --> 1008.43
oh it's flat oh sure okay fine well I'm

1006.39 --> 1015.42
still going to work I'm still gonna go

1008.43 --> 1017.8199999999999
to the pub you know just have my normal

1015.42 --> 1020.67
life and then so the oh wow the space

1017.82 --> 1022.5
guy again oh look at these some amazing

1020.67 --> 1024.87
footage yeah I love space yeah it's all

1022.5 --> 1027.72
real again you know some people just

1024.87 --> 1029.79
switch on a whim they don't really care

1027.72 --> 1031.64
they're just going with the dream and

1029.79 --> 1034.68
they don't really care about the reality

1031.64 --> 1035.8500000000001
in that sense it's not prioritized in

1034.68 --> 1038.16
their consciousness in their

1035.85 --> 1042.4489999999998
decision-making they just go with

1038.16 --> 1044.6000000000001
whatever that happens so anyway rambling

1042.449 --> 1044.6000000000001
on

1049.63 --> 1059.779
mmm right well a Jessica makes a

1057.13 --> 1061.19
somewhat fair statement perspective

1059.779 --> 1069.039
doesn't work on any model

1061.19 --> 1073.25
well it doesn't unregular purely you say

1069.039 --> 1075.799
geometry models that only take into

1073.25 --> 1081.649
account location in that kind of thing

1075.799 --> 1085.1589999999999
location but ray-tracing which is like a

1081.649 --> 1088.3899999999999
CGI process it's it's been around for a

1085.159 --> 1092.3300000000002
while I used to work on it with it on my

1088.39 --> 1102.679
Amiga 1200 and then in the 90s and the

1092.33 --> 1106.37
process is really simulate in in in a

1102.679 --> 1109.49
system with reflection refraction

1106.37 --> 1113.1789999999999
quality so it's really emulating the

1109.49 --> 1114.95
light and in that thing that fraction

1113.179 --> 1119.659
actually does happen

1114.95 --> 1122.57
because it's not just a wireframe model

1119.659 --> 1125.3600000000001
that's being displayed with coordinates

1122.57 --> 1127.7
that are just the court no there's

1125.36 --> 1131.029
actual visuals happen there's actual

1127.7 --> 1133.929
lights happening and being affected and

1131.029 --> 1136.549
then that fraction does set it so that

1133.929 --> 1139.779
that's something to think about

1136.549 --> 1143.809
actually actual real ray tracing visual

1139.779 --> 1146.539
systems will apply that there will have

1143.809 --> 1149.6789999999999
the obstruction effects all that it's

1146.539 --> 1153.529
just when you're doing basic models

1149.679 --> 1157.6100000000001
representative models that are only with

1153.529 --> 1162.98
coordinate bastes details that yeah that

1157.61 --> 1165.77
these things don't work like yeah the

1162.98 --> 1170.63
two and a half D model the auto graphic

1165.77 --> 1172.549
view just yeah it's not meant to have

1170.63 --> 1177.3400000000001
you in from she's not meant to emulate

1172.549 --> 1179.96
light it's only a representation a

1177.34 --> 1180.51
visual aid to conceptualize what's

1179.96 --> 1182.309
happening

1180.51 --> 1184.65
that's the only function it can really

1182.309 --> 1188.48
have you can't use it for specifics

1184.65 --> 1192.0
because it can't represent the actual

1188.48 --> 1196.58
ray-tracing process because of its

1192.0 --> 1196.58
limitations this is very complex process

1196.64 --> 1202.94
anyway I hope that explains a little

1219.64 --> 1223.89
right now Nikolas also makes a fair

1222.88 --> 1227.5
statement

1223.89 --> 1231.15
we are disclosure for flatter slowly

1227.5 --> 1236.17
seeps out through the people well I

1231.15 --> 1240.75
suggested pretty early on that first the

1236.17 --> 1244.39
Flat Earth will be because of the

1240.75 --> 1247.84
competition power company knowledge of

1244.39 --> 1249.929
power competition with the elites with

1247.84 --> 1253.0
the controllers within the ones that

1249.929 --> 1254.89
program the media for us we're in

1253.0 --> 1258.79
competition with them they're not likely

1254.89 --> 1261.5800000000002
to embrace quickly unless they can't

1258.79 --> 1266.02
help resist the seduction of the

1261.58 --> 1268.6299999999999
populist advantage is very commercial

1266.02 --> 1271.96
advantage very lowering like all big

1268.63 --> 1274.0590000000002
audience big people so even if they hate

1271.96 --> 1276.3700000000001
it they might be inclined to do that but

1274.059 --> 1278.35
that's not really gonna help on the long

1276.37 --> 1282.25
run because it's not gonna break out

1278.35 --> 1284.35
that way but what it can do because of

1282.25 --> 1285.61
the natural interest because of the

1284.35 --> 1288.309
truth

1285.61 --> 1290.26
the dispelling of lies and because it

1288.309 --> 1295.09
can really sink in even with basic

1290.26 --> 1297.91
people it can become really come the

1295.09 --> 1301.23
folklore a big folklore a thing that

1297.91 --> 1304.5700000000002
everybody's talked about heard about and

1301.23 --> 1306.25
considered maybe elementally believe it

1304.57 --> 1309.85
or maybe just like yeah maybe it's

1306.25 --> 1311.35
possible I I'm not too sure maybe I'll

1309.85 --> 1313.51
look into it a little late that kind of

1311.35 --> 1316.33
thing it will be common knowledge it

1313.51 --> 1318.64
will be folklore and it doesn't have to

1316.33 --> 1320.53
be a media they might even keep on going

1318.64 --> 1322.179
and doing the space and the globe and

1320.53 --> 1325.809
everything and everybody will know like

1322.179 --> 1329.77
yeah it's cool but it's kind of fantasy

1325.809 --> 1331.84
in a way they will have more perspective

1329.77 --> 1334.3899999999999
of what's actually going on and this is

1331.84 --> 1336.6399999999999
already leaking through in the

1334.39 --> 1338.1100000000001
alternative media concerning false flags

1336.64 --> 1343.14
that kind of thing like yeah it's not

1338.11 --> 1346.57
all real and that is the same kind of

1343.14 --> 1348.88
transition in consciousness as the Flat

1346.57 --> 1350.6899999999998
Earth concept and figure out like yeah

1348.88 --> 1355.429
that's also not entirely

1350.69 --> 1357.1090000000002
so the movement spiritually is already

1355.429 --> 1359.299
happening the big awakening and fire

1357.109 --> 1361.309
earth is a part of that it's one of the

1359.299 --> 1366.229
more niche higher spectrum part of it

1361.309 --> 1369.139
but yeah eventually it will and it can

1366.229 --> 1372.44
and it probably will become a common

1369.139 --> 1374.629
lore thing thing that people just talk

1372.44 --> 1377.929
about here and they're like yeah what do

1374.629 --> 1380.84
you think about this fantasize about it

1377.929 --> 1383.8590000000002
kind of like what I'm doing I'm just

1380.84 --> 1386.6589999999999
thinking like yeah what could be fun

1383.859 --> 1388.639
could you see this working could you see

1386.659 --> 1393.669
that working that kind of thing it it is

1388.639 --> 1396.019
great fun you know I'm here every day I

1393.669 --> 1399.3790000000001
mean every day on the flat earth debates

1396.019 --> 1401.599
talking about it discussing and bringing

1399.379 --> 1404.049
forth ideas figuring things out yes so

1401.599 --> 1407.059
much to work through

1404.049 --> 1411.739
so yeah common knowledge I think it will

1407.059 --> 1416.119
be that first and then it'll be like a

1411.739 --> 1418.82
public barrier against overly deluded

1416.119 --> 1422.599
propositions to prevent people from

1418.82 --> 1424.849
blindly stumbling into a deathtrap for

1422.599 --> 1427.6689999999999
example that kind of setup which the

1424.849 --> 1432.799
government made or something does do I

1427.669 --> 1437.419
guess presumably and can definitely do

1432.799 --> 1439.999
with this stuff yeah it'll just prevent

1437.419 --> 1442.0990000000002
people from voting against her own

1439.999 --> 1444.47
interest or being panicked that kind of

1442.099 --> 1446.539
thing it will make the public more

1444.47 --> 1450.049
resistant against the mind control and

1446.539 --> 1458.299
it's very necessary and over time that

1450.049 --> 1460.879
may give a chance to yeah to let the old

1458.299 --> 1463.6689999999999
controlling type of media die down and

1460.879 --> 1466.1899999999998
the old fashioned real journalism the

1463.669 --> 1469.0700000000002
classic journalism probably going to be

1466.19 --> 1471.499
a grassroots because so many people are

1469.07 --> 1473.809
already almost kind of doing it as they

1471.499 --> 1475.759
go just life or - they go the whole

1473.809 --> 1482.479
learning process everything they don't

1475.759 --> 1482.75
go to school then yeah get a contract

1482.479 --> 1485.1200000000001
and

1482.75 --> 1488.39
then do it and go for it no they just

1485.12 --> 1490.3999999999999
like hi I'm this guy I want to try this

1488.39 --> 1492.8000000000002
out and they try it out and to get

1490.4 --> 1494.99
better and there's something yeah over

1492.8 --> 1497.12
the years they might really like you

1494.99 --> 1499.28
know what I'm really gonna try to be a

1497.12 --> 1503.06
serious journalist now and to put in one

1499.28 --> 1505.25
step up and then eventually yeah that's

1503.06 --> 1507.01
how that works it's how it can work

1505.25 --> 1514.03
these days it doesn't have to be just

1507.01 --> 1518.39
contract study you baste the fruits of

1514.03 --> 1523.1299999999999
your work are much easier to put out to

1518.39 --> 1525.5900000000001
advertise with so that people that know

1523.13 --> 1528.44
how people work and develop can already

1525.59 --> 1530.81
see like well this guy has potential can

1528.44 --> 1532.97
pick him out on the internet now you

1530.81 --> 1535.8799999999999
don't have to go to a specific event

1532.97 --> 1537.89
there now as a talent finder could you

1535.88 --> 1539.75
go through the freaking internet and ya

1537.89 --> 1543.1100000000001
stumble upon a lot of freaking idiots

1539.75 --> 1545.15
and then find interesting people in

1543.11 --> 1546.83
between them and yeah interesting people

1545.15 --> 1550.19
tend to have other interesting people

1546.83 --> 1552.08
surrounding them and that can work now

1550.19 --> 1556.31
you don't even have to leave your house

1552.08 --> 1562.97
to do it it's very easy anyway I'm

1556.31 --> 1569.1399999999999
wandering off yeah so anyone still wants

1562.97 --> 1569.14
to join the show you know what to do

1574.179 --> 1576.99
Cheers

1595.49 --> 1598.57
talking about

1637.7 --> 1647.4
right award makes a statement like to

1644.04 --> 1652.28
respond to it doesn't understand the

1647.4 --> 1657.89
dependency in faith for knowledge well

1652.28 --> 1663.48
they are connected they faith can give

1657.89 --> 1666.72
confidence and this confidence can allow

1663.48 --> 1671.49
you to be stable enough to actually see

1666.72 --> 1675.8700000000001
clearly so it's not directly related but

1671.49 --> 1681.09
it assists through the back door

1675.87 --> 1683.3
you could say you know but religion can

1681.09 --> 1687.51
do that or like having a fantastic

1683.3 --> 1692.1
parents can do that too especially when

1687.51 --> 1697.32
you're really young or having like these

1692.1 --> 1699.48
really close colleagues or like bodies

1697.32 --> 1701.8799999999999
in the military that you like went

1699.48 --> 1708.27
through really deep things and have the

1701.88 --> 1711.42
action and yeah that also can drive you

1708.27 --> 1713.34
can give you extreme confidence to know

1711.42 --> 1715.1100000000001
that these people are out there and that

1713.34 --> 1720.72
you can rely on them and that they rely

1715.11 --> 1724.4399999999998
on you and that can be a foundation for

1720.72 --> 1727.53
you to see more clearly or something

1724.44 --> 1730.1000000000001
else it can happen but anyway your

1727.53 --> 1731.6399999999999
character hey Jose e yo are we with that

1730.1 --> 1734.1899999999998
what's happening

1731.64 --> 1738.0600000000002
ah just me talking again I'm on my way

1734.19 --> 1741.75
huh um just got off work so I'm a my my

1738.06 --> 1744.3899999999999
being cold right here you can see kind

1741.75 --> 1750.06
of in the street Tony's coming out

1744.39 --> 1754.74
it is 729 in the morning insects I'll be

1750.06 --> 1756.11
in tech stuff so as I go home kind of

1754.74 --> 1759.9
ride my way around oops

1756.11 --> 1762.57
only my camera on and the channel so you

1759.9 --> 1765.7800000000002
can see you can you can to stop you know

1762.57 --> 1768.27
mill myself I'm about to to is a

1765.78 --> 1770.46
different track I'm like maybe five

1768.27 --> 1771.45
minutes away so I'll keep riding and I

1770.46 --> 1773.96
can do a little

1771.45 --> 1782.519
a little Thai view on the famous

1773.96 --> 1789.3890000000001
Pontchartrain track cool well it's the

1782.519 --> 1794.24
weather really mild there - no yeah yeah

1789.389 --> 1797.1899999999998
if here - it's cloudy

1794.24 --> 1799.409
the Sun is kind of peeking through the

1797.19 --> 1800.8500000000001
clouds but if not I mean you can see

1799.409 --> 1803.7890000000002
it's not really powerful

1800.85 --> 1807.809
by this time sometimes he's just burning

1803.789 --> 1810.6589999999999
hard but yeah if he was really foggy and

1807.809 --> 1814.11
I were ago but now the fog dissipated

1810.659 --> 1816.8990000000001
and pretty clear but just cloudy it

1814.11 --> 1818.49
feels good it's not too cold not warm at

1816.899 --> 1820.9499999999998
all all right

1818.49 --> 1827.25
I'll move myself I keep riding a little

1820.95 --> 1831.24
bit all right cool yeah well yeah the

1827.25 --> 1833.87
weather here in contrast to the last few

1831.24 --> 1836.85
days has been extremely mild as well

1833.87 --> 1841.9499999999998
like really nice you can just stand

1836.85 --> 1846.75
outside and not too cool very pleasant

1841.95 --> 1851.179
so it's birthday I don't have my lamp on

1846.75 --> 1851.179
and I know because it's that lesson

1862.08 --> 1873.06
bicycle by a mystical anyway

1880.05 --> 1883.62
I stopped for a second to amuse myself

1881.43 --> 1885.93
do you see the train passing by the

1883.62 --> 1894.05
train is going across all the way at the

1885.93 --> 1894.05
end the resolutions not that great

1906.25 --> 1911.13
now I missed it

1941.99 --> 1946.66
yeah

1944.03 --> 1946.66
yeah

1948.59 --> 1952.2099999999998
ah this is really distracting

1982.66 --> 2003.5700000000002
so I'm stuck

2137.08 --> 2143.41
get home so you guys keep chatting on

2139.63 --> 2146.19
our relief and in the background what

2143.41 --> 2149.23
we're talking about today are when

2146.19 --> 2152.25
everything in nothing again I was about

2149.23 --> 2155.95
to share like an experience ahead of

2152.25 --> 2159.34
what's at the coffee shop and yeah I got

2155.95 --> 2162.85
really talking mood back it was

2159.34 --> 2166.56
yesterday night and I got to talk with

2162.85 --> 2170.35
this guy like real extensive and he was

2166.56 --> 2173.2
studying for being a theatre person

2170.35 --> 2176.7999999999997
basically like an axe hurt you and yeah

2173.2 --> 2179.41
I can talk about that I have some

2176.8 --> 2181.63
knowledge so basically really got it

2179.41 --> 2184.21
into it for him so he was very happy

2181.63 --> 2187.33
about somebody that he could share all

2184.21 --> 2189.25
these details with and he also shared

2187.33 --> 2191.14
lots of psychological stuff and

2189.25 --> 2194.53
apparently had a lot of trouble with

2191.14 --> 2199.3599999999997
depression but he's still in that phase

2194.53 --> 2201.0400000000004
where he in his mind constantly he's

2199.36 --> 2203.65
addicted to it let's just say it like

2201.04 --> 2205.36
that you become obsessed with it so you

2203.65 --> 2207.19
constantly want to think about it talk

2205.36 --> 2211.27
about it about something necked and that

2207.19 --> 2214.12
was a bit of issue he had but yeah

2211.27 --> 2217.45
eventually we got talking about a lot of

2214.12 --> 2220.2999999999997
things and I basically through flattered

2217.45 --> 2221.02
that him or well I had to because he was

2220.3 --> 2224.05
really in

2221.02 --> 2226.45
it said like yeah what do you do and I

2224.05 --> 2227.9500000000003
said like yeah I do hangouts talk about

2226.45 --> 2232.27
a lot of things about science about

2227.95 --> 2235.21
psychology about history everything and

2232.27 --> 2239.14
he was very enthusiastic science I said

2235.21 --> 2241.27
okay here's my channel name yeah before

2239.14 --> 2246.0699999999997
you go there there's something you need

2241.27 --> 2252.3
to know about what we talked about Flat

2246.07 --> 2256.51
Earth and he immediately it's like okay

2252.3 --> 2259.3
but isn't that he basically had a very

2256.51 --> 2261.19
basic response and didn't know it so

2259.3 --> 2263.65
that was really one of the first times

2261.19 --> 2265.81
he was ever confronted with it in a

2263.65 --> 2269.05
serious manner and he already knew that

2265.81 --> 2272.56
I was a damn well intelligent person

2269.05 --> 2276.5800000000004
because I basically expressed it in

2272.56 --> 2278.77
detail to him in many things and so here

2276.58 --> 2280.48
that's the use of it you know if you

2278.77 --> 2282.31
start out with flat earth people will

2280.48 --> 2284.349
have this preconception and will filter

2282.31 --> 2286.119
everything you say but if you don't

2284.349 --> 2290.5
start out with Flat Earth and just talk

2286.119 --> 2293.589
about everything and show your knowledge

2290.5 --> 2297.88
and skill then they know that that is

2293.589 --> 2299.859
real and they can't replace that if you

2297.88 --> 2302.9500000000003
say talk about Flat Earth afterwards

2299.859 --> 2305.83
they just know like what how does this

2302.95 --> 2308.2599999999998
instead of like oh my god this is a flat

2305.83 --> 2310.75
earth or anything he may say maybe sound

2308.26 --> 2312.6400000000003
intelligent but he's a loony but if they

2310.75 --> 2315.28
don't have that preconception they just

2312.64 --> 2317.41
like how does this really intelligent

2315.28 --> 2319.48
person believe Flat Earth they'll be

2317.41 --> 2322.66
mystified about that instead and it's

2319.48 --> 2325.23
much better than just not having

2322.66 --> 2329.68
absorbed any of your skills

2325.23 --> 2331.93
so that's what happened and I don't know

2329.68 --> 2335.02
if he's gonna be a flat earther probably

2331.93 --> 2337.8999999999996
not from the feeling of it but he is

2335.02 --> 2340.21
yeah like so many people still open to

2337.9 --> 2343.06
learning a little about it about what's

2340.21 --> 2347.31
happening and then maybe stay on the

2343.06 --> 2350.95
sidelines or sit on it sit on it just

2347.31 --> 2353.5
digest it over a period see what happens

2350.95 --> 2357.24
you know a lot of people do that do you

2353.5 --> 2357.24
think you need to evangelize about it

2357.96 --> 2365.349
how evangelize how how does that work

2362.05 --> 2368.5600000000004
well think it's the preaching to people

2365.349 --> 2369.28
turning people onto it do you think you

2368.56 --> 2372.2799999999997
need to do that

2369.28 --> 2374.8
I don't preach about it we told people

2372.28 --> 2378.099
about it yeah yeah that's called talking

2374.8 --> 2382.0890000000004
with people preaching evangelizing

2378.099 --> 2384.4
that's taking a box I'm standing on it

2382.089 --> 2387.43
and speaking publicly out loud

2384.4 --> 2390.369
that's evangelizing that's not what I do

2387.43 --> 2392.3199999999997
ever that would not be appreciated if a

2390.369 --> 2394.53
person like me the way that I look would

2392.32 --> 2397.42
be doing that freak people out

2394.53 --> 2399.52
well it's gonna evangelizing that's my

2397.42 --> 2401.589
understanding of the world please just

2399.52 --> 2405.099
having a conversation and talking about

2401.589 --> 2408.73
things it's like bringing up stories you

2405.099 --> 2411.099
know well just spreading the word

2408.73 --> 2418.089
preaching the gospel so to speak it's

2411.099 --> 2420.069
spreading the subject with yuka Center

2418.089 --> 2423.46
we're not even realizing we're not

2420.069 --> 2424.56
saying let's believe this or I will be

2423.46 --> 2433.89
in trouble

2424.56 --> 2438.49
well I import an unicorns that has right

2433.89 --> 2440.0789999999997
can you hear anybody shouting Jose No No

2438.49 --> 2442.8689999999997
maybe I gonna come back when the

2440.079 --> 2444.73
telethon and try to pick an ear to see

2442.869 --> 2445.3
by here it will be show hasn't started

2444.73 --> 2455.44
yet

2445.3 --> 2457.98
I was joking goin joking no there's an

2455.44 --> 2462.25
only shouts like that during the debates

2457.98 --> 2468.4
do you think that's an act no I think he

2462.25 --> 2470.44
means it yeah I think he means that I

2468.4 --> 2472.75
have joined the show before the show

2470.44 --> 2475.03
started before he used to transmit it to

2472.75 --> 2476.4
recorder to the second channel I used to

2475.03 --> 2481.119
be just sitting in the background and in

2476.4 --> 2484.42
talking to Riley or whatever and yeah he

2481.119 --> 2484.82
he just acts the same as his life or not

2484.42 --> 2489.35
you know

2484.82 --> 2493.1600000000003
the active thing it's probably going to

2489.35 --> 2500.18
give himself aneurysm before his forte

2493.16 --> 2503.24
nonsense what why not that's not how you

2500.18 --> 2505.8799999999997
get aneurysm b9 being angry and up

2503.24 --> 2509.24
tights no no no that's not how it works

2505.88 --> 2511.4300000000003
you sure know you'd know how it works

2509.24 --> 2514.6099999999997
I'll tell ya it's through German new

2511.43 --> 2517.6699999999996
medicine anyway it's very obvious you

2514.61 --> 2523.2400000000002
don't get it from being angry you get it

2517.67 --> 2525.92
from being angry and being like an

2523.24 --> 2528.1699999999996
unresolved tension like something you

2525.92 --> 2530.66
can fix and you're frustrated about if

2528.17 --> 2533.36
you're gonna act out on that that's

2530.66 --> 2537.41
where you get any risen from you're just

2533.36 --> 2541.04
expressing dominance and direct

2537.41 --> 2543.3199999999997
agitation over something you hate that's

2541.04 --> 2545.54
not a problem - no - no no that doesn't

2543.32 --> 2548.84
create that friction that will bring

2545.54 --> 2551.6
that tension that will disrupt your time

2548.84 --> 2554.6000000000004
uzuki you know it has to have that

2551.6 --> 2557.9
strain over time that's constant stress

2554.6 --> 2561.0499999999997
in order to actually get to that do you

2557.9 --> 2561.4100000000003
know what's an onion resumes yes what is

2561.05 --> 2563.78
it

2561.41 --> 2566.6
it's basically the blood vessels

2563.78 --> 2568.8500000000004
rupturing yeah it's a weakened wall and

2566.6 --> 2571.49
yeah and that happens because of very

2568.85 --> 2574.85
specific type of circumstance yeah but

2571.49 --> 2579.04
it can game mad and frustrated and

2574.85 --> 2581.96
stress and adrenaline Mittman makes it

2579.04 --> 2584.12
more prevalent to happen and to both

2581.96 --> 2584.96
you'll have that weakness if you have a

2584.12 --> 2587.81
bodily weakness

2584.96 --> 2589.31
it'll give himself fault no but that

2587.81 --> 2591.47
doesn't work that way you have to have

2589.31 --> 2593.63
the weakness in order for it to even

2591.47 --> 2597.95
happen some people will just never get

2593.63 --> 2599.7400000000002
it and then over stress it through

2597.95 --> 2602.4199999999996
circumstance especially chronic

2599.74 --> 2603.02
circumstances that makes the risk even

2602.42 --> 2606.01
higher

2603.02 --> 2610.25
some people just don't get it ever

2606.01 --> 2613.3900000000003
that's true that's true so yeah he's not

2610.25 --> 2616.67
gonna get it there's only ridiculous

2613.39 --> 2618.68
you'd be serious today Owen I'm always

2616.67 --> 2622.7200000000003
serious all the time

2618.68 --> 2627.74
yeah now the worst Nathan's gonna get is

2622.72 --> 2629.33
go too far like be too fibrous cuz he

2627.74 --> 2631.4799999999996
does tend to do that because he's so

2629.33 --> 2635.27
good at it and it's almost like a it's

2631.48 --> 2637.37
like an arts I agree it's cool it's kind

2635.27 --> 2639.83
of like own [ __ ] are you really going

2637.37 --> 2643.04
there he's so good at it but yeah that

2639.83 --> 2645.41
could eventually and him help him up in

2643.04 --> 2647.45
being all of a sudden being smacked in

2645.41 --> 2649.85
the face by somebody that he really

2647.45 --> 2651.95
insulted really painfully and just pay

2649.85 --> 2653.96
attention to that could happen instead

2651.95 --> 2657.0499999999997
so you think but he's not gonna get some

2653.96 --> 2659.09
medical condition out of it

2657.05 --> 2662.6000000000004
so you think one day he might pick on

2659.09 --> 2663.98
the wrong person now what so you think

2662.6 --> 2668.0299999999997
one day he might pick on the wrong

2663.98 --> 2669.62
person the wrong person yeah it might

2668.03 --> 2678.9500000000003
pick on somebody that he meets in real

2669.62 --> 2683.23
life yeah he might like the thing is he

2678.95 --> 2686.33
is he is being a little bit reckless and

2683.23 --> 2690.44
yeah it it's just how he is it's not

2686.33 --> 2692.96
that can cause in the wrong circumstance

2690.44 --> 2695.18
if you're not careful enough you can hit

2692.96 --> 2699.23
the people in the wrong spot and they

2695.18 --> 2701.6299999999997
can freak out and obviously you in that

2699.23 --> 2705.53
[ __ ] and like in karma

2701.63 --> 2706.52
hm do you believe in karma what goes

2705.53 --> 2711.2000000000003
around comes around

2706.52 --> 2712.85
yeah absolutely I think you know in

2711.2 --> 2714.77
social environments and communities that

2712.85 --> 2717.2
we live in that tends to be true I think

2714.77 --> 2718.85
you you've got to be careful and I think

2717.2 --> 2720.5299999999997
the other thing I when I was thinking

2718.85 --> 2723.11
about that I want to talk to you about

2720.53 --> 2726.71
was you know what we I think we've

2723.11 --> 2728.54
discussed it before in like 20 years

2726.71 --> 2730.61
somebody's gonna have copies of those

2728.54 --> 2733.46
videos or the videos might still be up

2730.61 --> 2737.02
and I often wonder what people will

2733.46 --> 2739.94
think of themselves and their behavior

2737.02 --> 2742.18
they will be nostalgic about it do you

2739.94 --> 2744.35
think so absolutely

2742.18 --> 2746.8599999999997
no embarrass depending on the

2744.35 --> 2749.18
circumstances it depends on if we've

2746.86 --> 2751.29
gotten credit for it if the world has

2749.18 --> 2753.5099999999998
become a better place

2751.29 --> 2757.05
with then yeah we would be nostalgic

2753.51 --> 2759.8700000000003
about it if we're completely Fox and the

2757.05 --> 2762.36
New World Order is basically declaring

2759.87 --> 2763.83
world dictatorship and literally there's

2762.36 --> 2764.7000000000003
no more freedom and there's nothing

2763.83 --> 2766.56
you're going to do about it

2764.7 --> 2772.5299999999997
yeah it's kind of just like another

2766.56 --> 2776.25
painful memory about better days so yeah

2772.53 --> 2777.63
I've often wondered what in this day an

2776.25 --> 2779.79
era when we're talking about it's

2777.63 --> 2781.7000000000003
different for kids growing up you know

2779.79 --> 2784.86
with you could you could quite possibly

2781.7 --> 2788.04
have your whole history online for

2784.86 --> 2790.02
people to look at and view whereas right

2788.04 --> 2797.13
for somebody older like me that that's

2790.02 --> 2800.48
not not possible I guess Darla pence and

2797.13 --> 2804.84
the level of dignity you want to have

2800.48 --> 2807.83
even recognize that exists because some

2804.84 --> 2814.98
people it's like this courage to even

2807.83 --> 2818.2799999999997
regard dignity as a thing well the idea

2814.98 --> 2820.35
is always to attack me fear the idea is

2818.28 --> 2822.5
to attack the idea and not the person

2820.35 --> 2824.52
isn't it

2822.5 --> 2827.01
there's no need to

2824.52 --> 2832.59
I forgot the individual you attack the

2827.01 --> 2834.9300000000003
idea what do you mean you'd be more

2832.59 --> 2835.4700000000003
specific well the fat was arguing with

2834.93 --> 2838.14
you

2835.47 --> 2839.43
I wouldn't attack your personality or

2838.14 --> 2841.47
how you looked

2839.43 --> 2845.81
I would attack the idea that you were

2841.47 --> 2848.79
talking about or discuss that right

2845.81 --> 2850.59
whereas you know slinging insults and

2848.79 --> 2852.89
things like that you know gets people's

2850.59 --> 2856.1400000000003
back up and I think for me yeah

2852.89 --> 2858.42
necessarily depends on the timing yeah

2856.14 --> 2860.67
well it can it can be entertaining we

2858.42 --> 2863.03
know we both know but not just that it

2860.67 --> 2866.79
can also be very justified look Nathan

2863.03 --> 2870.5400000000004
gets angry and really viperous for a

2866.79 --> 2874.08
good reason he doesn't start out yelling

2870.54 --> 2876.27
to people no he asks a question he

2874.08 --> 2878.58
demands a certain answer and then people

2876.27 --> 2880.53
don't give that or they say really

2878.58 --> 2882.7799999999997
stupid things and they just keep on get

2880.53 --> 2884.38
he usually gets really vipers after

2882.78 --> 2886.599
three or four time

2884.38 --> 2889.15
the same process has been repeated

2886.599 --> 2892.42
that's when he gets really pissed off

2889.15 --> 2896.17
and that's damn well logical I don't get

2892.42 --> 2898.119
that you don't get it well it's not that

2896.17 --> 2902.41
I don't get it oh it it's that I don't

2898.119 --> 2908.0190000000002
trust it I think it's an act that's of a

2902.41 --> 2911.17
logical statement boy if you get it then

2908.019 --> 2914.41
how could you not trust it I get it

2911.17 --> 2916.599
because it works on a number of levels

2914.41 --> 2919.96
first you got the argument in which he

2916.599 --> 2920.799
builds a gotcha that is impossible to

2919.96 --> 2924.579
answer

2920.799 --> 2928.48
ie the evidence required when demand

2924.579 --> 2932.289
when all the Ptolemaic gotcha

2928.48 --> 2935.079
he uses John's scripts doesn't he know

2932.289 --> 2936.9700000000003
he goes no he rarely does

2935.079 --> 2940.9
we've been hammering mostly on real

2936.97 --> 2943.93
facts the last few days yeah so ask me

2940.9 --> 2947.7690000000002
these these kind of arguments have been

2943.93 --> 2949.8999999999996
used like John basis niall ism and I

2947.769 --> 2952.3289999999997
agree to that but that's rarely they

2949.9 --> 2955.15
will know that now they know there's

2952.329 --> 2957.19
trouble with that so they're I've rarely

2955.15 --> 2960.039
heard them use them anymore good to see

2957.19 --> 2963.2200000000003
from the stupid natural world [ __ ]

2960.039 --> 2965.4900000000002
it's likely misunderstood they rarely

2963.22 --> 2967.9199999999996
hear them approach it now it's 40 better

2965.49 --> 2972.3999999999996
because it's just a snake

2967.92 --> 2974.17
yes I'm ever agreed with John son

2972.4 --> 2979.69
definition of the scientific method

2974.17 --> 2985.1800000000003
that's all well agree he's basically

2979.69 --> 2989.349
using an outdated model and made it even

2985.18 --> 2993.16
more regressive well it is his model he

2989.349 --> 2994.9
uses suppose it's the ancient classical

2993.16 --> 2996.3089999999997
model how it started out but if you're

2994.9 --> 2999.67
gonna look through the history of the

2996.309 --> 3003.69
scientific method it's a huge library of

2999.67 --> 3005.9700000000003
things so much has happened with it and

3003.69 --> 3009.93
the concept and how its applied and how

3005.97 --> 3013.0789999999997
change and why so he's using like one of

3009.93 --> 3015.6299999999997
the oldest concepts how it started out

3013.079 --> 3019.8
but yeah that's not

3015.63 --> 3021.9900000000002
we use anymore it still kind of works

3019.8 --> 3025.53
but there's so little lady you can

3021.99 --> 3028.29
actually do with it that's why it's come

3025.53 --> 3030.6000000000004
out dated nobody uses it anymore what do

3028.29 --> 3034.46
you think you use a little Asif e what

3030.6 --> 3041.25
you think he uses that particular on

3034.46 --> 3047.1
well because it's an easy win if you

3041.25 --> 3050.1
yeah if you were accepted it's an easy

3047.1 --> 3053.33
fallback position that yeah I don't like

3050.1 --> 3058.95
it but that is what it is

3053.33 --> 3062.79
sure sure I'm some shoutouts

3058.95 --> 3067.68
shoutout to roon yeah sure let me do the

3062.79 --> 3075.95
shoutouts it's my show only Larson and

3067.68 --> 3084.0

3084.0 --> 3098.31
sayin of course peanuts Clark yeah shut

3089.7 --> 3100.4399999999996
up to what I'm being attracted no shout

3098.31 --> 3108.87
out to our wing in the shed over here in

3100.44 --> 3114.9500000000003
there so alright anyway yeah just gonna

3108.87 --> 3119.5499999999997
end in within 5 minutes somewhere anyway

3114.95 --> 3122.0099999999998
you know but for all your poking holes

3119.55 --> 3126.8100000000004
and trying to emphasize negative things

3122.01 --> 3128.76
about Nathan and about yeah yeah you are

3126.81 --> 3131.5499999999997
no questions

3128.76 --> 3133.3500000000004
yeah I know I know it's very lawyer

3131.55 --> 3134.73
speak to say that but that's what you're

3133.35 --> 3136.29
doing you're not even doing it

3134.73 --> 3139.2
aggressively but that's what you're

3136.29 --> 3141.39
doing you always do that but you're only

3139.2 --> 3144.66
really pointing at a pretty small

3141.39 --> 3149.43
fragment of the entire thing and even

3144.66 --> 3153.66
these negative elements have a function

3149.43 --> 3155.91
in the hole for the whole and not just

3153.66 --> 3157.47
for anyone Outsiders that think oh yeah

3155.91 --> 3159.99
it's gonna be ruined by that no

3157.47 --> 3161.5499999999997
everything has a functioning like

3159.99 --> 3167.0699999999997
otherwise it wouldn't be running like

3161.55 --> 3169.07
this for year just like asking difficult

3167.07 --> 3171.84
uncomfortable questions sometimes our

3169.07 --> 3174.3300000000004
alright and I'd like to give extremely

3171.84 --> 3175.4700000000003
elaborate details all-encompassing

3174.33 --> 3179.43
answers

3175.47 --> 3181.3799999999997
shout out to was this is a really

3179.43 --> 3183.5699999999997
interesting question to ask because when

3181.38 --> 3185.76
I'm let's stay in the gym panda that I

3183.57 --> 3187.8
was maybe two days ago I was hanging in

3185.76 --> 3191.07
there for a few hours later at night

3187.8 --> 3193.38
and one of the guys didn't recognize me

3191.07 --> 3196.38
he never heard me and it's true because

3193.38 --> 3198.63
I'm like nobody you know and one of the

3196.38 --> 3200.82
guys say he said have I heard you in the

3198.63 --> 3202.86
Nathan in the Florida bass show talking

3200.82 --> 3205.11
over there yeah probably you have always

3202.86 --> 3207.1800000000003
there he said alright and then the

3205.11 --> 3209.9700000000003
conversation changed and they started

3207.18 --> 3212.25
telling me about how nathan is if Nathan

3209.97 --> 3213.93
believe this and and his reason act the

3212.25 --> 3216.54
same thing that Adam does so it is

3213.93 --> 3219.48
interesting when people realize that we

3216.54 --> 3222.48
are participants of the Florida Bay show

3219.48 --> 3224.82
they target their focus to pursue

3222.48 --> 3226.8
internal personalities is I don't know

3224.82 --> 3229.65
odd to me this approach

3226.8 --> 3232.4100000000003
it's not odd at all Nathan's freaking

3229.65 --> 3235.4100000000003
triggering he's the guy that literally

3232.41 --> 3237.93
out brings out the freakin whip is

3235.41 --> 3240.68
difficult on before interested you know

3237.93 --> 3245.6099999999997
so far and he's so good at it's so

3240.68 --> 3248.43
poison sofa 9 like real like an

3245.61 --> 3250.56
old-fashioned teacher and that tends to

3248.43 --> 3254.0699999999997
get to people may be triggered and will

3250.56 --> 3257.79
obsess over it I think we we do oh and I

3254.07 --> 3260.46
think I think most of us think is an

3257.79 --> 3262.98
addict yeah but the thing is you're

3260.46 --> 3267.9
thinking about it so you do that's what

3262.98 --> 3270.2400000000002
it is that's I don't lose any sleep over

3267.9 --> 3272.7000000000003
it no but you're spending a lot of time

3270.24 --> 3275.6099999999997
actually having it in your present in

3272.7 --> 3277.41
your conscious under skin you because

3275.61 --> 3280.9500000000003
she'll go on also and so does

3277.41 --> 3282.69
Jose that's right yeah but you're not

3280.95 --> 3284.5499999999997
asking questions about us

3282.69 --> 3286.4700000000003
it's a lot of questions about Nathan

3284.55 --> 3288.1200000000003
about you is this how is that yeah

3286.47 --> 3290.7799999999997
you're thinking about him a lot whether

3288.12 --> 3292.89
you like it or not that's a reality I
