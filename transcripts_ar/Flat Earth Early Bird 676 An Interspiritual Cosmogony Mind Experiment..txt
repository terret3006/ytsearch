77.68 --> 81.68
and please also do support me through

79.84 --> 83.68
paypal patreon the super chat and

81.68 --> 87.84
membership system join button

83.68 --> 91.68
they'll be much appreciated so

87.84 --> 95.52000000000001
starting on time today for change

91.68 --> 97.60000000000001
today is quite different though it's

95.52 --> 99.119
yeah another one of those very cloudy

97.6 --> 102.399
days

99.119 --> 106.799
and it's yeah misty so also

102.399 --> 109.6
raining very lightly

106.799 --> 110.0
up and down every now and then and it's

109.6 --> 112.83999999999999
been

110.0 --> 115.84
very moist it's been very moist all

112.84 --> 115.84
night

116.24 --> 119.28
although even though yeah in the evening

118.479 --> 122.399
there was

119.28 --> 124.32000000000001
quite a bit of clear sky i could even

122.399 --> 127.68
see the moon

124.32 --> 131.039
and some stars but yes the night

127.68 --> 134.72
progressed eventually it started to get

131.039 --> 134.72
more clouded and rainy

140.84 --> 147.68
so

143.12 --> 147.68
yeah let's see who's in chat

148.16 --> 151.28
i got green tea

153.519 --> 159.59900000000002
okay michael o'rourke was first brendam

156.959 --> 160.0
tom parker and alexander with the super

159.599 --> 163.92
chat

160.0 --> 166.64
99 rsd

163.92 --> 166.64
is that again

167.04 --> 171.84
i don't remember what it was but thanks

174.879 --> 181.84
uh right i had a very late

178.879 --> 184.48
night again last night i tried not to

181.84 --> 188.64000000000001
it's really difficult not

184.48 --> 190.879
because yeah once you get stuck

188.64 --> 193.35999999999999
in that rhythm it's very tough to get

190.879 --> 193.35999999999999
out again

195.599 --> 200.879
but yeah i've mostly been up just

198.4 --> 200.87900000000002
watching

210.84 --> 213.84
films

216.48 --> 219.92
yeah i just should make a habit of it

219.12 --> 222.08
it's like hey

219.92 --> 223.28
i'm seeing a new movie i want to watch

222.08 --> 225.519
that

223.28 --> 226.56
let's not watch it now from beginning to

225.519 --> 228.31900000000002
end

226.56 --> 230.72
that would be a good habit to have in

228.319 --> 230.72
the night

233.28 --> 237.92
hey good servant what is that

238.799 --> 242.87900000000002
is it's a very small american flag

244.959 --> 249.599
thank you for the super chat donation 99

252.84 --> 255.84
cents

262.8 --> 269.84000000000003
yeah i saw your stream with tom parker

265.84 --> 269.84
your upload this morning

272.479 --> 275.52
it was it was good

277.12 --> 280.88
but yeah tom park you should realize

279.12 --> 283.919
there is no proof of

280.88 --> 287.68
the the dome even the

283.919 --> 290.639
mentioning of the encyclopedia are

287.68 --> 292.639
like hints there are certain things

290.639 --> 295.52
going on

292.639 --> 296.0
there is an obstruction in some way but

295.52 --> 299.28
that does

296.0 --> 302.16
not yeah imply the dome

299.28 --> 304.23999999999995
like as in a very specific geometrical

302.16 --> 308.08000000000004
structure

304.24 --> 310.88
and yet yeah you really put

308.08 --> 312.8
that in there and that i almost want to

310.88 --> 314.71999999999997
comment about it but i'm just commenting

312.8 --> 318.32
here on this show

314.72 --> 325.84000000000003
per enok there is so sure

318.32 --> 325.84
the dome all right

334.24 --> 342.56
oh god you believe in a dome too

338.24 --> 346.08
right well

342.56 --> 349.6
when you believe in something

346.08 --> 350.32
as basic as that then you could close

349.6 --> 354.0
off

350.32 --> 357.28
oh yeah your doors

354.0 --> 357.28
to other conceptions

358.56 --> 367.84
a sleeping warrior

375.199 --> 378.56
now if he signs when when we're talking

377.44 --> 382.479
down we're talking a

378.56 --> 385.6
physical container not

382.479 --> 386.56
a presumed to be endless amounts of

385.6 --> 389.91900000000004
lights

386.56 --> 392.8
very very far away not that definitely

389.919 --> 396.15999999999997
not that this is about containment

392.8 --> 396.16
the containment of the realm

397.28 --> 402.31899999999996
but yeah all these uses of the word dome

404.639 --> 408.0
yeah what what kind of dome i have no

407.199 --> 410.479
doubt that

408.0 --> 412.16
the realm is contained and the container

410.479 --> 415.199
must be

412.16 --> 417.91900000000004
physical or or cons

415.199 --> 418.24
have the same aspects as a physical dome

417.919 --> 419.599
here

418.24 --> 421.599
because here we go again with

419.599 --> 425.12
speculation about what it should be

421.599 --> 427.44
it could literally be the end of space

425.12 --> 428.16
and nothing can go beyond and that would

427.44 --> 432.88
be

428.16 --> 432.88000000000005
as if it was made of something

432.96 --> 437.68
like unbreakably solid

436.08 --> 439.52
but it doesn't have to be if it's

437.68 --> 440.72
unbreakable then it could simply be the

439.52 --> 444.479
end of space

440.72 --> 448.72
in that specific geometry

444.479 --> 449.199
so and we don't know the specific shape

448.72 --> 452.56
of it

449.199 --> 454.479
so to just call it a dome it implies so

452.56 --> 457.759
much

454.479 --> 460.56
that we don't have proof for and even a

457.759 --> 460.56
translation

461.759 --> 464.8
from the book of enoch and i don't know

463.759 --> 468.24
the the

464.8 --> 470.24
the details of this what it says exactly

468.24 --> 473.039
but it is of course a translation to

470.24 --> 476.879
english you gotta realize that

473.039 --> 479.84
oh wanna add me uh hey sleeping warrior

476.879 --> 479.84000000000003
got something on your mind

484.8 --> 493.84000000000003
what about

503.599 --> 507.52
so i believe in the two no

510.96 --> 515.36
dome is not the right there's not enough

514.56 --> 518.8389999999999
proof to

515.36 --> 520.34
be as specific as to be calling it a

518.839 --> 524.5390000000001
dome

520.34 --> 524.539
[Music]

525.279 --> 529.2
and as long as there is no possibility

527.6 --> 533.6800000000001
to go outside of

529.2 --> 537.76
this enclosure to call it a dome is

533.68 --> 540.8
already kind of incorrect because it's

537.76 --> 543.36
just an enclosure while a dome

540.8 --> 544.0
specifically is like a separation

543.36 --> 549.839
between

544.0 --> 549.839
spaces and there's no proof of that

551.279 --> 557.2
right yeah a firmament

554.72 --> 558.08
but right but firmer the word firmament

557.2 --> 561.36
even is

558.08 --> 564.72
yeah when you're thinking about it

561.36 --> 564.72
it implies much more

565.279 --> 571.12
containment than the separation between

574.839 --> 580.08
spaces

576.88 --> 581.8389999999999
yeah a dome encloses something but it

580.08 --> 584.5600000000001
also implies there's something

581.839 --> 584.5600000000001
outside of it

585.839 --> 590.399
when we make domes there may be

589.2 --> 592.08
something in it but

590.399 --> 594.24
but there's always something outside of

592.08 --> 594.24
it

595.2 --> 599.44
now physically outside other space

597.92 --> 605.8389999999999
outside

599.44 --> 605.839
that is what it kind of implies

618.399 --> 621.76
oh really so what physical space is

620.32 --> 624.0100000000001
outside

621.76 --> 626.48
space not a being

624.01 --> 630.16
[Music]

626.48 --> 630.16
which i kind of find the meaning

631.44 --> 638.8800000000001
to imply that that specifically but

636.079 --> 640.079
the space outside you don't know that

638.88 --> 644.079
what what are you

640.079 --> 644.079
on what are you on here what is this

645.12 --> 652.16
heaven other physical

648.959 --> 652.959
space outside of the dome and i'm not

652.16 --> 655.36
talking about

652.959 --> 656.0
a compart what are you saying that the

655.36 --> 660.32
earth

656.0 --> 664.56
is a dome within a heavenly realm

660.32 --> 664.5600000000001
what the [ __ ] where are you getting this

672.839 --> 675.839
from

686.839 --> 689.839
so

698.88 --> 708.16
okay so your guess

703.839 --> 711.6
cosmogeny that you are now implying

708.16 --> 717.36
like savants spamming in my chat almost

711.6 --> 720.16
right i have to take note of that

717.36 --> 721.6800000000001
it's i don't know an undefined amount of

720.16 --> 725.36
space

721.68 --> 725.3599999999999
which is heavenly i guess

725.519 --> 733.12
and then a separated dome inside of it

730.32 --> 734.1600000000001
and in that dome is the earth realm with

733.12 --> 737.519
the earth rules

734.16 --> 741.36
and the creator of it

737.519 --> 744.5600000000001
has made his throne on top of it

741.36 --> 747.6
in the wider heavenly space

744.56 --> 750.16
surrounding the dome

747.6 --> 750.88
that is the suggestion so you say

750.16 --> 754.16
there's like an

750.88 --> 754.16
outer space heaven

755.12 --> 759.519
or does it have its own landmass that's

757.6 --> 761.36
connected with earth and it's just the

759.519 --> 764.88
separation of heaven

761.36 --> 770.839
what sounds about right

764.88 --> 773.8389999999999
okay goody oh that sounds very

770.839 --> 773.839
fantastical

796.0 --> 802.079
great so the original conception of

799.36 --> 804.9590000000001
just a bunch of clouds and floating

802.079 --> 804.959
rocks maybe

805.279 --> 808.8
and flying

809.04 --> 811.5999999999999
creatures

812.16 --> 817.279
like the serebins that that like

814.639 --> 819.76
medieval idea of heaven that's it

817.279 --> 821.12
that that is literally what you think is

819.76 --> 828.16
real

821.12 --> 831.279
it's outside there it's physically there

828.16 --> 833.76
yeah that sounds really fantastical

831.279 --> 837.36
who knows man i'm not i'm not even gonna

833.76 --> 840.8389999999999
perfectly exclude it but the adamantness

837.36 --> 843.36
of your assertion here you're basically

840.839 --> 847.839
claiming claiming scientific

843.36 --> 851.519
literal physicality

847.839 --> 851.9200000000001
and things to the level of geometry

851.519 --> 855.36
that's

851.92 --> 857.279
that's quite bold

855.36 --> 859.519
based on something that's written in a

857.279 --> 859.519
book

860.24 --> 863.199
but okay

864.8 --> 868.079
now i said almost scientific but you're

867.199 --> 870.639
taking it

868.079 --> 872.7199999999999
on the same level or or is this just a

870.639 --> 874.72
story you really really like

872.72 --> 878.639
because i'm a cosmogenist i want to

874.72 --> 881.76
physically figure out what things are

878.639 --> 884.24
and then try to describe it so i take it

881.76 --> 887.4399999999999
very seriously and

884.24 --> 889.279
i'm also yeah and not

887.44 --> 891.36
taking things for granted just like that

889.279 --> 893.279
oh like oh yeah there is just more space

891.36 --> 895.1990000000001
there and it is heaven and the rules

893.279 --> 897.199
work different natural law doesn't apply

895.199 --> 901.4399999999999
there if things float

897.199 --> 904.24
there's no gravity no relative density

901.44 --> 904.24
separation

905.36 --> 910.5600000000001
an infinite energy or something almost

908.16 --> 914.079
like the bubble would be

910.56 --> 917.5999999999999
yeah the degeneration of heaven

914.079 --> 918.6389999999999
in a specific location and relative

917.6 --> 922.399
density

918.639 --> 925.6
application and yeah and then

922.399 --> 928.639
periodic energy insertion

925.6 --> 930.0
so there's like parts of heavenly energy

928.639 --> 933.04
going through the realm

930.0 --> 935.279
according to that periodically

933.04 --> 940.24
through basically through the sun the

935.279 --> 943.4399999999999
moments of sun

940.24 --> 945.6
i don't know man it actually i don't

943.44 --> 948.639
like to say these things it actually

945.6 --> 951.519
feels like it's halfway fireball it

948.639 --> 954.32
i can model it quickly in my head that's

951.519 --> 956.9590000000001
already kind of surprising because i've

954.32 --> 960.88
seen imagery like this

956.959 --> 963.4399999999999
just imagery and very suggestive

960.88 --> 964.639
never really had somebody describe it

963.44 --> 967.9200000000001
literally to me

964.639 --> 968.8
in just in terms and like this is this

967.92 --> 970.959
that is that

968.8 --> 974.3199999999999
and describe piece by piece without

970.959 --> 978.959
getting all glory about something

974.32 --> 982.32
right but just the raw description

978.959 --> 984.6389999999999
but who knows maybe that is kind of like

982.32 --> 988.88
how this is it it's so it would be like

984.639 --> 988.88
an experiment from heaven almost

989.279 --> 993.8389999999999
the entire earth realm would be like an

991.44 --> 997.839
experiment from heaven

993.839 --> 997.839
very weird

998.72 --> 1003.1990000000001
or maybe earth is like and this i

1001.68 --> 1006.56
wouldn't be the first one to say it's

1003.199 --> 1006.56
more like a pandemonium

1006.639 --> 1015.36
it's like a gateway between the two

1011.199 --> 1015.3599999999999
dimensions of heaven and hell

1016.0 --> 1025.839
it's like a cross over space where both

1018.24 --> 1025.839
can interface with that space

1027.12 --> 1033.839
it's interesting and any way you're

1030.959 --> 1036.799
gonna think about it

1033.839 --> 1037.6
but yeah as for actual geometrics and

1036.799 --> 1041.039
all that

1037.6 --> 1043.6789999999999
and physical space and how that works

1041.039 --> 1044.4
it doesn't really help a lot with that

1043.679 --> 1047.1200000000001
although i

1044.4 --> 1047.52
yeah for example what i just put down

1047.12 --> 1051.52
about

1047.52 --> 1055.36
okay so if geometrically the earth

1051.52 --> 1058.559
is within the space of heaven

1055.36 --> 1060.799
if heaven surrounds it from all

1058.559 --> 1062.24
sides including the bottom because the

1060.799 --> 1063.9189999999999
entire earth room would be like a

1062.24 --> 1067.6
floating rock

1063.919 --> 1068.16
enclosed within heaven that surrounds it

1067.6 --> 1070.32
from

1068.16 --> 1073.039
all sides and i don't know is infinite

1070.32 --> 1074.96
or another looping square from us i

1073.039 --> 1077.12
don't know how the

1074.96 --> 1079.679
mechanics of heavenly space work if it's

1077.12 --> 1082.8799999999999
even literal and here is the problem

1079.679 --> 1084.88
is it actually literal or is that just

1082.88 --> 1087.3600000000001
the way the spirit would perceive it and

1084.88 --> 1090.7990000000002
there is no physical space

1087.36 --> 1092.84
in the same sense as it is here bound by

1090.799 --> 1095.36
matter

1092.84 --> 1098.48
because the conditions do not

1095.36 --> 1100.9599999999998
exist there or persist

1098.48 --> 1103.6
for that form of physical yeah that

1100.96 --> 1105.919
physical form of reality to be there so

1103.6 --> 1108.559
it can only ever be a reflection of the

1105.919 --> 1111.6000000000001
mind like a dark world experience

1108.559 --> 1114.3999999999999
you know so again see

1111.6 --> 1115.36
it's a you you just took all these

1114.4 --> 1118.4
things

1115.36 --> 1119.28
as i described the description for

1118.4 --> 1122.4
granted

1119.28 --> 1126.08
but you overlooked that maybe that is

1122.4 --> 1129.3600000000001
a spirit description like people

1126.08 --> 1132.559
having out of body experiences

1129.36 --> 1133.4399999999998
being taken along by angels or by higher

1132.559 --> 1135.52
spirits

1133.44 --> 1136.799
can also happen darker spirits i don't

1135.52 --> 1140.559
recommend it i

1136.799 --> 1143.679
know how that works it's horrific

1140.559 --> 1145.9189999999999
but you can be taken with them and

1143.679 --> 1147.8400000000001
you are assuming you're seeing it with

1145.919 --> 1151.919
physical eyes

1147.84 --> 1152.799
no physicality assumption bias at work

1151.919 --> 1155.5200000000002
again

1152.799 --> 1158.16
through another root no no no that may

1155.52 --> 1162.559
be the spiritual representation of

1158.16 --> 1164.4
how the spirit without the body sees it

1162.559 --> 1166.48
and the spirit without the body will

1164.4 --> 1170.72
very likely see the physical

1166.48 --> 1174.96
realm also as as it looks physically

1170.72 --> 1178.799
perhaps plus some spiritual

1174.96 --> 1182.0
things on top of that like add-ons

1178.799 --> 1182.6399999999999
auras you could for example classify as

1182.0 --> 1185.36
almost

1182.64 --> 1189.2800000000002
spirit side that kind of thing you could

1185.36 --> 1189.28
probably as a spirit see a little more

1190.32 --> 1194.6399999999999
right but then to assume that you're

1192.64 --> 1195.6000000000001
looking out on heaven and that that is

1194.64 --> 1198.64
all physical

1195.6 --> 1200.3999999999999
reality in some way like what if you

1198.64 --> 1203.039
took the spirit side away

1200.4 --> 1203.76
would that mean it's actually all a

1203.039 --> 1207.039
infinite

1203.76 --> 1209.2
blackness with a bunch of random floaty

1207.039 --> 1210.72
rocks

1209.2 --> 1212.559
and that's what's really there and the

1210.72 --> 1214.72
rest is all energy

1212.559 --> 1215.84
is that what's really good see there's

1214.72 --> 1218.799
all these

1215.84 --> 1220.24
questions that i typically come up with

1218.799 --> 1223.6
like what

1220.24 --> 1226.4
is specifically the physical

1223.6 --> 1228.8799999999999
what is specifically the spirit energy

1226.4 --> 1231.039
reality

1228.88 --> 1234.3200000000002
because i've had experiences that kind

1231.039 --> 1238.0
of separates them

1234.32 --> 1238.0
in a very consistent manner

1238.64 --> 1248.4
he went up there physically oh really

1242.32 --> 1251.84
are you sure about that

1248.4 --> 1254.4
because trust me when you go out of body

1251.84 --> 1258.32
it's very easy to mistake your body

1254.4 --> 1258.3200000000002
being there because you still feel it

1258.96 --> 1262.64
and psychosomatically your interactions

1261.52 --> 1265.28
with your spirit

1262.64 --> 1267.919
will make you feel it just like kind of

1265.28 --> 1271.52
in the matrix that idea

1267.919 --> 1273.44
remember like all these things

1271.52 --> 1274.799
yeah gotta realize that all these

1273.44 --> 1277.039
science fiction writers

1274.799 --> 1278.24
these are all people that typically do

1277.039 --> 1282.0
drugs

1278.24 --> 1286.08
heavy [ __ ] psychedelics

1282.0 --> 1288.24
have these types of experiences and then

1286.08 --> 1289.1999999999998
try to translate some of these

1288.24 --> 1293.36
experiences

1289.2 --> 1293.679
into fiction elements of movies and that

1293.36 --> 1296.0
make

1293.679 --> 1299.76
that makes it so appealing because it is

1296.0 --> 1299.76
kind of based on real things

1302.0 --> 1319.84
real experiences from people

1305.039 --> 1319.84
in in the surreal

1324.559 --> 1333.2
you know walk with god

1328.159 --> 1336.159
all right sure it's all these

1333.2 --> 1338.4
all these claims about you yeah of

1336.159 --> 1339.679
course you are asserting oh of course

1338.4 --> 1344.0
physical again you're doing it

1339.679 --> 1344.0
physicality assumption by is doing it

1344.84 --> 1361.84
again

1347.12 --> 1361.84
people can't help yourselves can you

1365.28 --> 1371.28
ew well tiny wumble yeah

1368.88 --> 1373.2
yeah the disgusting thing about that

1371.28 --> 1376.08
description is

1373.2 --> 1376.88
that might also be true it's just not

1376.08 --> 1378.799
going to be

1376.88 --> 1382.0800000000002
the same type of spirit you're

1378.799 --> 1388.8799999999999
interacting with if you know what i mean

1382.08 --> 1392.96
see tiny wombo

1388.88 --> 1396.0800000000002
there's some freaky entities out there

1392.96 --> 1398.64
because yeah well because earth

1396.08 --> 1400.08
might be potentially pandemonium a

1398.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
gateway between

1400.08 --> 1403.84
heaven and hell

1417.28 --> 1425.84
proves a spirit or entity

1421.2 --> 1427.6000000000001
uh yeah well i'm sorry

1425.84 --> 1431.84
it's a little difficult to go there

1427.6 --> 1431.84
scientifically if you know what i mean

1432.799 --> 1439.039
although there's plenty of research with

1435.84 --> 1442.0
like paranormal experiences

1439.039 --> 1443.52
that are have gone pretty fast in just

1442.0 --> 1445.6
cataloging

1443.52 --> 1446.559
how things seem to function and

1445.6 --> 1450.0
persistent

1446.559 --> 1454.96
unique abilities and traits of things

1450.0 --> 1455.36
so there's definitely probably something

1454.96 --> 1459.8400000000001
there

1455.36 --> 1459.84
it's just yeah

1460.64 --> 1463.8400000000001
it's very hard to basically translate

1463.52 --> 1467.2
that

1463.84 --> 1473.6
into into physics

1467.2 --> 1475.76
and all that

1473.6 --> 1477.039
you know the spirit and human

1475.76 --> 1478.72
consciousness says oh

1477.039 --> 1481.919
have always had their own kind of

1478.72 --> 1484.84
separate domains anyway from physics

1481.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
because it's kind of supernatural

1484.84 --> 1487.84
consciousness

1515.36 --> 1529.84
oh god

1540.84 --> 1543.84
hmm

1551.6 --> 1570.32
yo could you please

1555.2 --> 1585.8400000000001
just calm it down

1570.32 --> 1585.84
hey julio pavin good to see you

1624.84 --> 1627.84
so

1638.84 --> 1641.84
hmm

1647.84 --> 1651.84
oh you got heavy wins julio heaven

1652.399 --> 1655.84
now be careful with that

1667.2 --> 1673.279
yeah man up it's all this

1670.24 --> 1673.76
judgment day talk and all that [ __ ] i'm

1673.279 --> 1676.0
just

1673.76 --> 1678.1589999999999
look i'm just trying to be a cosmogenist

1676.0 --> 1681.279
here because

1678.159 --> 1682.96
i find it all not it doesn't make me

1681.279 --> 1687.44
very happy

1682.96 --> 1690.559
oh okay hello guns have never owned rmp

1687.44 --> 1694.48
paypal well that sounds really

1690.559 --> 1694.48
bad but that does typically make me

1694.84 --> 1710.24
happy

1696.08 --> 1712.559
uh i'll check it out

1710.24 --> 1712.559
ooh

1713.36 --> 1720.399
nice thank you very much

1717.679 --> 1723.52
that's awesome thank you very much guns

1720.399 --> 1725.84
of nephron rmp

1723.52 --> 1725.84
ah

1726.72 --> 1732.72
it's a miracle how much

1730.0 --> 1733.36
like moments like these for me like

1732.72 --> 1735.279
lighten

1733.36 --> 1737.52
things up literally it's like oh wait

1735.279 --> 1739.84
that's not really a problem anymore now

1737.52 --> 1741.12
yes awesome thank you thank you very

1739.84 --> 1745.52
much

1741.12 --> 1745.52
for your continual support great

1745.84 --> 1749.84
as for the whole apocalypse thing i'm

1748.0 --> 1751.2
just thinking about it like a game

1749.84 --> 1755.039
master

1751.2 --> 1758.24
like a cosmogenist and also i'm doing it

1755.039 --> 1761.44
to kind of keep my feelings out of it

1758.24 --> 1762.3990000000001
because i find it all rather distressing

1761.44 --> 1764.88
the idea

1762.399 --> 1767.4399999999998
realizing that it might actually be

1764.88 --> 1771.0390000000002
directly applicable

1767.44 --> 1774.48
to the place where i am standing

1771.039 --> 1777.6
so i find it all very

1774.48 --> 1779.1200000000001
unnerving but

1777.6 --> 1781.52
yeah when i think about it as a

1779.12 --> 1783.6789999999999
cosmogenist then i'm just trying to

1781.52 --> 1785.2
figure out okay what is the mechanics

1783.679 --> 1787.2
going on it's like

1785.2 --> 1790.24
the earth to heaven and hell is like a

1787.2 --> 1790.24
big puzzle box

1790.799 --> 1798.399
you know

1794.559 --> 1802.32
puzzle box almost like a sphere

1798.399 --> 1804.32
with one square on top heaven and

1802.32 --> 1806.799
one square on the bottom hill or

1804.32 --> 1806.799
something

1807.6 --> 1810.799
and then i'm thinking about gates and

1809.679 --> 1814.48
all that so okay

1810.799 --> 1818.08
maybe the end

1814.48 --> 1818.08
game of the creation

1818.399 --> 1822.0
judgment day would be that first the

1821.52 --> 1825.76
barrier

1822.0 --> 1827.279
between hell and the earth realm is

1825.76 --> 1830.08
lifted and then

1827.279 --> 1832.0
between heaven and the earth realm and

1830.08 --> 1834.08
then there's like a direct gateway

1832.0 --> 1836.0
opening between the two it's like

1834.08 --> 1837.6789999999999
the two sides have suddenly got an open

1836.0 --> 1840.399
gate between them

1837.679 --> 1840.3990000000001
through earth

1840.96 --> 1848.0
through the earth dimension setting and

1843.919 --> 1850.3200000000002
then they have to kind of duke it out

1848.0 --> 1852.559
and it's probably like the cosmic battle

1850.32 --> 1852.559
that

1853.2 --> 1856.72
that has been building since the

1854.88 --> 1858.3200000000002
beginning of creation as it were i don't

1856.72 --> 1860.559
know

1858.32 --> 1860.559
so

1863.12 --> 1866.399
very fantastical

1866.72 --> 1870.24
but also very scary

1872.159 --> 1877.0390000000002
we are going to stay on earth or a

1874.32 --> 1879.84
thousand what

1877.039 --> 1879.84
really

1889.679 --> 1896.48
okay hurry

1893.84 --> 1898.9599999999998
yeah i guess although a thousand years

1896.48 --> 1900.88
is a lot you know

1898.96 --> 1902.08
and it all depends on the type of

1900.88 --> 1904.3990000000001
mechanisms that

1902.08 --> 1906.8799999999999
propel us because we're constantly

1904.399 --> 1910.08
slaves of meaning

1906.88 --> 1912.159
and purpose senses of purpose and our

1910.08 --> 1913.9189999999999
own impulses will that still work the

1912.159 --> 1915.919
same then

1913.919 --> 1918.24
because then yeah a thousand years is a

1915.919 --> 1920.88
whole freaking lot of time

1918.24 --> 1922.96
and if you still have an ego which is

1920.88 --> 1925.8400000000001
kind of like the antecedent

1922.96 --> 1928.08
to what it means to be a human being

1925.84 --> 1931.6789999999999
like without the ego

1928.08 --> 1934.559
would you even be you for me the ego

1931.679 --> 1935.919
and what i've learned about him it that

1934.559 --> 1939.12
side of me

1935.919 --> 1941.279
i've really utilized it in in my being

1939.12 --> 1942.6399999999999
and in my decision making so without an

1941.279 --> 1945.76
ego would you even be you

1942.64 --> 1946.96
and then okay taking that ego with you

1945.76 --> 1950.24
into heaven

1946.96 --> 1952.96
a thousand years with

1950.24 --> 1954.72
a thousand other people would the

1952.96 --> 1958.0
complete loss

1954.72 --> 1960.3990000000001
or the the drop away of the the typical

1958.0 --> 1962.559
experience of losing people around you

1960.399 --> 1966.1589999999999
would that be sufficient to not go

1962.559 --> 1966.1589999999999
insane in a thousand years

1966.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
yes existential questions

1978.0 --> 1981.84
yeah a thousand years of peace like that

1980.48 --> 1983.84
seems

1981.84 --> 1988.0
from the perspective of being a person

1983.84 --> 1988.0
with an ego it seems completely insane

1988.399 --> 1992.1589999999999
but hey do the mechanics of everything

1991.519 --> 1995.919
still

1992.159 --> 1998.72
work the way that we're used to

1995.919 --> 2000.159
when the earth is lifted into the

1998.72 --> 2004.24
heavenly

2000.159 --> 2008.48
frequencies like that

2004.24 --> 2011.039
when the old uh binding mechanisms are

2008.48 --> 2011.039
dissolved

2011.919 --> 2017.3600000000001
will it still be will we

2015.36 --> 2019.1999999999998
would it be still be an experience like

2017.36 --> 2022.4799999999998
a human being then

2019.2 --> 2025.039
or will we become something else

2022.48 --> 2028.24
and we're not propelled anymore by what

2025.039 --> 2028.24
typically propels us

2028.32 --> 2032.72
will not be seduced constantly by a

2031.76 --> 2035.919
certain type of

2032.72 --> 2039.44
impulses or ideas i don't know

2035.919 --> 2039.44
i have no idea

2052.33 --> 2055.58
[Music]

2057.839 --> 2063.44
okay good so yeah when you say that i'm

2060.32 --> 2066.8790000000004
gonna be a complete smart ass now

2063.44 --> 2067.44
and kind of break this holy tension

2066.879 --> 2069.2799999999997
because

2067.44 --> 2071.76
i find it kind of uncomfortable it makes

2069.28 --> 2074.96
me feel too floaty

2071.76 --> 2076.8
and i'm here on earth now so if you say

2074.96 --> 2079.04
that jesus will be

2076.8 --> 2080.48
light the sun is gone does that mean

2079.04 --> 2083.359
that jesus will go

2080.48 --> 2083.359
into orbit

2084.879 --> 2088.879
because the earth is still a ball in

2086.399 --> 2090.24
heaven right hey if you're a baller and

2088.879 --> 2092.879
you're going to heaven

2090.24 --> 2094.0
because you still believe in jesus does

2092.879 --> 2097.7599999999998
that mean that

2094.0 --> 2103.839
it will represent to you as a ball earth

2097.76 --> 2103.8390000000004
in heaven and then jesus will orbit it

2105.92 --> 2109.04
sorry i had to do that

2109.28 --> 2117.8390000000004
i have to get back down to earth and

2110.96 --> 2117.839
we're still here dealing with ballers

2136.72 --> 2140.0789999999997
and i'm wondering sometimes if there's

2138.64 --> 2144.0789999999997
like a whole group of

2140.079 --> 2146.96
or that there's giant amounts of people

2144.079 --> 2147.599
in churches say in churches where the

2146.96 --> 2151.28
globe

2147.599 --> 2154.32
is just part of the vernacular

2151.28 --> 2156.7200000000003
with everything and even with heaven are

2154.32 --> 2157.6800000000003
they in circles like gonna ask questions

2156.72 --> 2159.7599999999998
like this is like

2157.68 --> 2161.839
oh if jesus is the light according to

2159.76 --> 2165.44
the bible does that mean that he's

2161.839 --> 2166.88
instead of the sun he's going to orbit

2165.44 --> 2170.88
the earth

2166.88 --> 2174.0
i wonder how many kids

2170.88 --> 2174.4
and all that have asked this question by

2174.0 --> 2178.32
now

2174.4 --> 2178.32
in churches i'm really wondering

2179.359 --> 2183.119
because it's not too weird to think up

2182.16 --> 2187.2799999999997
of

2183.119 --> 2201.44
because of heliocentric indoctrination

2187.28 --> 2204.8
i will be i wonder like that

2201.44 --> 2205.599
can you imagine like oh the everybody is

2204.8 --> 2209.04
lifted now

2205.599 --> 2212.1600000000003
into the heavenly scenario

2209.04 --> 2215.2
like the evil ones have all truly been

2212.16 --> 2217.359
they're going away

2215.2 --> 2218.56
and we're in heaven now but we still got

2217.359 --> 2221.119
globers

2218.56 --> 2223.119
and what if these globers like what if

2221.119 --> 2226.0
we still have to deal

2223.119 --> 2227.839
with the flat earth versus globe issue

2226.0 --> 2230.079
because it's not so much an earthly

2227.839 --> 2233.52
issue it's a spiritual issue it's an

2230.079 --> 2234.96
issue about mind things about the

2233.52 --> 2237.28
imagination

2234.96 --> 2238.32
and what if that problem basically

2237.28 --> 2241.8390000000004
ascends with us

2238.32 --> 2244.079
into heaven and we still have to do this

2241.839 --> 2246.48
even though we're not even in the

2244.079 --> 2248.6400000000003
physical reality anymore

2246.48 --> 2251.52
because because it could cause a divide

2248.64 --> 2251.52
within heaven

2252.16 --> 2255.359
yeah this is really fantastic now at

2254.0 --> 2258.4
this point but

2255.359 --> 2262.0789999999997
hey science fiction you know it's the

2258.4 --> 2262.079
natural consequence of being a

2268.839 --> 2271.839
cosmogenesis

2275.75 --> 2279.099
[Music]

2296.839 --> 2299.839
hmm

2300.4 --> 2307.52
right maybe that's like

2304.24 --> 2310.64
the ultimate devil's trick

2307.52 --> 2312.56
it's like the devil's revenge

2310.64 --> 2314.72
the last thing he could do before he was

2312.56 --> 2318.24
cut off from the earth realm

2314.72 --> 2322.48
is create a giant

2318.24 --> 2325.52
amazing religion of what the and

2322.48 --> 2326.56
what of what reality is is like and that

2325.52 --> 2329.52
that

2326.56 --> 2330.0
may as almost like a curse carry forth

2329.52 --> 2333.92
even

2330.0 --> 2337.119
into heaven after heaven

2333.92 --> 2341.04
has yeah has settled has opened up

2337.119 --> 2342.96
its gates to the earth roman takes over

2341.04 --> 2344.079
and then maybe it's like the final

2342.96 --> 2347.44
struggle

2344.079 --> 2351.92
and it will eventually dissolve

2347.44 --> 2354.8
naturally but it's like the last breath

2351.92 --> 2355.76
of this truth that through our spirits

2354.8 --> 2358.8
carried forth

2355.76 --> 2360.8
into heaven so very faint weird and

2358.8 --> 2363.44
esoteric and fantastical at this point

2360.8 --> 2363.44
this idea

2363.839 --> 2368.96
if you would imagine that the devil or

2368.24 --> 2372.16
some

2368.96 --> 2376.32
specific dark entity or spirit

2372.16 --> 2380.48
from hell originally

2376.32 --> 2384.32
engaged with humanity by suggesting

2380.48 --> 2388.079
this fantastical reversed world reality

2384.32 --> 2390.88
did did the darkness itself envision

2388.079 --> 2393.04
this specifically like an escape dream

2390.88 --> 2394.839
and it just happened to be so amazing

2393.04 --> 2397.44
that

2394.839 --> 2399.68
humanity some you may some wizards

2397.44 --> 2402.2400000000002
latched onto this fit this

2399.68 --> 2402.7999999999997
dark vision basically this reversed

2402.24 --> 2405.5989999999997
world

2402.8 --> 2406.4
vision of a dark entity that was

2405.599 --> 2409.76
extremely

2406.4 --> 2412.1600000000003
all-encompassing like reaching into

2409.76 --> 2414.3190000000004
science fiction future just captivating

2412.16 --> 2415.359
captivating captivating away from

2414.319 --> 2418.0
reality

2415.359 --> 2419.119
and that they just took a they grasped

2418.0 --> 2422.4
onto it

2419.119 --> 2426.88
they grabbed it and then they made it

2422.4 --> 2426.88
into their own spiritual lego set

2427.28 --> 2430.4
and it worked really well because it

2429.119 --> 2435.119
rubbed off on people

2430.4 --> 2437.28
like little kids if you give them a toy

2435.119 --> 2438.48
eventually yeah one might figure out

2437.28 --> 2441.119
what you can do with the toy and then

2438.48 --> 2444.16
everybody wants to play with it too

2441.119 --> 2446.2400000000002
and maybe this is kind of what

2444.16 --> 2448.0789999999997
outer space and all that and science

2446.24 --> 2451.2799999999997
fiction futurism

2448.079 --> 2453.2000000000003
what that is and because

2451.28 --> 2456.0
yeah if you show what you can do with it

2453.2 --> 2467.839
everybody wants to play with it too

2456.0 --> 2467.839
in their minds fantasizing about it

2473.119 --> 2481.839
all right

2491.68 --> 2495.52
right and it it could even go as far but

2494.88 --> 2497.44
this is like

2495.52 --> 2499.68
yeah this gets really creepy like that

2497.44 --> 2502.0
you know

2499.68 --> 2504.48
it could even go as far as that like the

2502.0 --> 2508.72
globe cosmology

2504.48 --> 2511.839
idea was designed by the devil

2508.72 --> 2514.8799999999997
for his own agents to prevent them from

2511.839 --> 2514.88
killing themselves

2515.68 --> 2520.839
so they had a dream to escape in and

2517.92 --> 2522.2400000000002
kind of shut out all the dark

2520.839 --> 2524.7999999999997
consequences

2522.24 --> 2527.1189999999997
and it was designed for that as like a

2524.8 --> 2528.6400000000003
counter spell to prevent logos from

2527.119 --> 2531.6800000000003
triggering

2528.64 --> 2531.68
through escapism

2535.2 --> 2539.04
or maybe that is what it eventually

2538.48 --> 2542.4
became

2539.04 --> 2544.56
used for because it's basically just a

2542.4 --> 2547.44
very simple thing

2544.56 --> 2550.4
you can put you can describe it in as a

2547.44 --> 2552.88
very simple mechanism the entire

2550.4 --> 2555.28
first world globe cosmology

2552.88 --> 2556.1600000000003
heliocentrism outer space futurism

2555.28 --> 2559.6800000000003
science

2556.16 --> 2562.24
all that thing is literally

2559.68 --> 2564.16
just reimagining the world from a

2562.24 --> 2566.9599999999996
reversed world vantage point

2564.16 --> 2568.7999999999997
an escapism the fantasy can do this the

2566.96 --> 2572.079
fantasy can typically create

2568.8 --> 2573.8390000000004
fill up what reality lacks

2572.079 --> 2575.119
so yeah if you're going to build a

2573.839 --> 2578.64
completely you can

2575.119 --> 2580.7200000000003
then utilize that mechanism to reap to

2578.64 --> 2583.52
let automatically build an entire

2580.72 --> 2585.5989999999997
reversed world reality

2583.52 --> 2587.839
that the imagination will latch on very

2585.599 --> 2590.0
easily

2587.839 --> 2592.56
and it's an effective escape mechanism

2590.0 --> 2594.319
the imagination is an escapist mechanism

2592.56 --> 2597.92
to prevent

2594.319 --> 2601.52
getting stressed out getting burned out

2597.92 --> 2607.839
to relieve some stress

2601.52 --> 2607.839
by evading your focus to imagination

2626.319 --> 2628.64
right

2631.839 --> 2638.0789999999997
but yeah it's just that it's an escapist

2635.92 --> 2641.119
mechanism

2638.079 --> 2644.319
that yeah it's very

2641.119 --> 2648.6400000000003
can be very fast

2644.319 --> 2652.48
it's like these a couple of weird

2648.64 --> 2655.839
it's almost like it works so well

2652.48 --> 2657.76
because it breaks natural law

2655.839 --> 2660.0
because it has a vacuum without a

2657.76 --> 2663.119
container

2660.0 --> 2664.0
for example like because there is no

2663.119 --> 2666.48
curve it's like

2664.0 --> 2670.56
it's literally the reversed world thing

2666.48 --> 2670.56
and it's almost like the imagination

2673.119 --> 2678.48
yeah when you use the imagination as an

2675.52 --> 2680.079
escapist mechanism right

2678.48 --> 2681.76
well just think about it when you

2680.079 --> 2684.7200000000003
realize wait

2681.76 --> 2685.599
what i thought is out there is not true

2684.72 --> 2688.72
that's

2685.599 --> 2690.8
very stressful then what happens what

2688.72 --> 2693.52
can happen what can be conditioned

2690.8 --> 2696.6400000000003
even by yourself by other people that

2693.52 --> 2699.7599999999998
then the escapism mechanism

2696.64 --> 2703.7599999999998
triggers and you mistake it

2699.76 --> 2705.8390000000004
for trying to figure out the answer

2703.76 --> 2707.0400000000004
but what happens instead is you go into

2705.839 --> 2709.44
the

2707.04 --> 2711.2
imagination escapist mechanism looking

2709.44 --> 2714.319
at it again

2711.2 --> 2715.4399999999996
believing it because in your imagination

2714.319 --> 2718.8
it's glorious

2715.44 --> 2720.2400000000002
then forgetting about that you just that

2718.8 --> 2722.48
it's not real

2720.24 --> 2723.7599999999998
that you just heard that argument and

2722.48 --> 2725.359
that this is for

2723.76 --> 2727.92
the cause of a lot of the cause

2725.359 --> 2733.5989999999997
cognitive dissonance of ballers

2727.92 --> 2738.64
that that is the mechanism behind it

2733.599 --> 2742.079
and i had that mechanism in me

2738.64 --> 2742.0789999999997
i think roughly up until

2743.2 --> 2751.2799999999997
i was 19 or something maybe longer

2747.2 --> 2751.2799999999997
and then eventually i broke out of it

2751.839 --> 2757.599
and that really made me really badly

2755.119 --> 2757.599
depressed

2759.76 --> 2766.96
but not in a passive way but like

2763.2 --> 2770.16
yeah rage win time in

2766.96 --> 2772.079
a but not as visceral or well visceral

2770.16 --> 2775.92
but not as expressive

2772.079 --> 2777.92
but just really bad it was definitely

2775.92 --> 2789.839
subjected to a lot of dark spirits

2777.92 --> 2789.839
during that period

2791.04 --> 2797.2799999999997
right but i got out of it

2794.24 --> 2801.68
by just being very careful not get

2797.28 --> 2804.48
fooled to be drawn into escapism

2801.68 --> 2806.7999999999997
back to try and get back into the matrix

2804.48 --> 2806.8
you know

2807.119 --> 2811.359
to not get back again to stay out to get

2809.839 --> 2814.0
used to being staying

2811.359 --> 2814.96
out to get used to that that is the new

2814.0 --> 2817.76
default i

2814.96 --> 2819.76
must use that as a new default i must

2817.76 --> 2821.0400000000004
learn to build up from there as a

2819.76 --> 2823.599
vantage point

2821.04 --> 2823.599
and i have

2829.2 --> 2835.7599999999998
but it's yeah it took a lot of time

2832.96 --> 2835.76
and agony

2836.0 --> 2839.52
and i'm not even talking about the flat

2837.92 --> 2843.6800000000003
earth i'm just talking about

2839.52 --> 2847.2
not going along with like this naive

2843.68 --> 2847.2
autopilot situation

2847.52 --> 2850.8
thinking that you can just go along with

2849.599 --> 2852.88
all of it

2850.8 --> 2855.2000000000003
and then still do a couple of good

2852.88 --> 2858.6400000000003
things here and there

2855.2 --> 2860.96
well that doesn't work

2858.64 --> 2863.1189999999997
i figured that out like as i was going

2860.96 --> 2865.76
it doesn't work

2863.119 --> 2866.88
it's it becomes the supposed good

2865.76 --> 2869.92
intentions become

2866.88 --> 2871.6800000000003
folly they're snowed under by just going

2869.92 --> 2874.079
along

2871.68 --> 2876.16
with the bigger agenda that is really

2874.079 --> 2879.119
bad and you don't know how bad because

2876.16 --> 2880.73
you prevent yourself from seeing it

2879.119 --> 2882.96
it's too scary

2880.73 --> 2887.28
[Music]

2882.96 --> 2890.64
like a hostage situation

2887.28 --> 2894.1600000000003
that's more pushed to the side

2890.64 --> 2894.16
in your subconscious anyway

2898.72 --> 2904.3999999999996
what are you talking about good servant

2900.64 --> 2904.4
i'm talking about a long time ago now

2912.72 --> 2917.4399999999996
i've been here the whole time i just got

2915.119 --> 2920.4
my hands full

2917.44 --> 2922.0
all right dank now of course i'm not

2920.4 --> 2928.4
going to take a vaccine why would you

2922.0 --> 2932.0
even say that

2928.4 --> 2934.2400000000002
no not gonna take a vaccine

2932.0 --> 2935.839
i'm not just gonna stand by and take a

2934.24 --> 2938.64
bullet either

2935.839 --> 2941.44
you know so hey if they insist that

2938.64 --> 2943.2
they're gonna do that

2941.44 --> 2945.28
i'm gonna take that as they're gonna

2943.2 --> 2949.2
attempt to kill me

2945.28 --> 2949.2000000000003
it's i'm it's not gonna be accepted

2953.04 --> 2956.48
and if that means that they're gonna

2954.48 --> 2960.079
confine me from doing

2956.48 --> 2964.64
anything at all that i will break out

2960.079 --> 2967.92
i will violate absolutely i will

2964.64 --> 2970.8799999999997
and if people don't take that

2967.92 --> 2972.16
take me undercover like a robin hood

2970.88 --> 2975.119
situation

2972.16 --> 2976.96
if if shop owners would actually get to

2975.119 --> 2978.96
the point that where they would refuse

2976.96 --> 2984.079
my business

2978.96 --> 2987.44
then i will start stealing it

2984.079 --> 2988.0
that's just and i i would even like try

2987.44 --> 2990.48
to steal

2988.0 --> 2992.64
like rob them and then pay them like no

2990.48 --> 2993.599
you will take my money and i will take

2992.64 --> 2996.8799999999997
the food

2993.599 --> 3000.319
like that because i don't want to

2996.88 --> 3001.2000000000003
yeah you know what i mean but i i

3000.319 --> 3004.5589999999997
wouldn't know

3001.2 --> 3005.5989999999997
what else to do really i'm just very

3004.559 --> 3007.44
adamant about this

3005.599 --> 3009.92
like now these are the rights there's

3007.44 --> 3010.96
people and business owners too making

3009.92 --> 3013.599
mistakes

3010.96 --> 3016.319
and they all need to realize that it's a

3013.599 --> 3020.319
legal game

3016.319 --> 3023.2799999999997
it's like a huge casino the giant corona

3020.319 --> 3025.68
business casino and if you play with

3023.28 --> 3029.28
that game

3025.68 --> 3029.2799999999997
eventually you're gonna lose

3037.119 --> 3043.92
so don't play with that game and

3040.72 --> 3045.7599999999998
but if you do then realize that there's

3043.92 --> 3048.0
people out there that know what

3045.76 --> 3048.96
you are doing what you're playing with

3048.0 --> 3051.2
and that care

3048.96 --> 3053.04
actually more probably about your

3051.2 --> 3054.0
business than you do because you're

3053.04 --> 3056.5589999999997
freaking obsessed

3054.0 --> 3059.119
with it and you're making bad decisions

3056.559 --> 3059.119
because of it

3059.2 --> 3065.04
see so i yeah if for example

3062.64 --> 3065.7599999999998
i really really hope it never comes to

3065.04 --> 3067.68
this

3065.76 --> 3070.2400000000002
it's like the organic grocery store

3067.68 --> 3073.2799999999997
owner suddenly says like no you

3070.24 --> 3075.359
this isn't on lockdown and [ __ ]

3073.28 --> 3078.2400000000002
i would care more about their business

3075.359 --> 3081.68
than they do at that point

3078.24 --> 3084.319
and i would get yeah i would really

3081.68 --> 3084.8799999999997
almost like try to take over just say

3084.319 --> 3089.52
like no

3084.88 --> 3092.48
no nobody do what he says

3089.52 --> 3093.359
you guys gotta stop this and besides

3092.48 --> 3095.28
what is he gonna do

3093.359 --> 3096.7999999999997
fire everyone that means the entire

3095.28 --> 3098.7200000000003
business is gone anyway

3096.8 --> 3100.079
so this person has to it has to be

3098.72 --> 3102.3999999999996
stopped

3100.079 --> 3104.1600000000003
has to be bypassed somehow what is the

3102.4 --> 3107.44
issue why is he doing this

3104.16 --> 3110.0
anyway it's it's not my business

3107.44 --> 3111.599
it isn't right now but it is kind of my

3110.0 --> 3115.52
food source

3111.599 --> 3118.079
so if it is endangered i will get

3115.52 --> 3118.079
involved

3118.88 --> 3123.2000000000003
i will try at least anyway

3123.52 --> 3129.92
but yeah no no masks

3127.04 --> 3129.92
no vaccine

3131.52 --> 3136.8
social distancing yeah

3135.2 --> 3139.2799999999997
yeah if you're gonna if people are gonna

3136.8 --> 3141.3590000000004
be arrested for that that's absurd

3139.28 --> 3142.8
but it's like okay if people want to

3141.359 --> 3144.96
social distance then

3142.8 --> 3146.559
yeah you probably want a social distance

3144.96 --> 3148.4
from them too

3146.559 --> 3150.6400000000003
because if they're that anxious that

3148.4 --> 3154.319
they really believe in that

3150.64 --> 3155.839
then they're probably not that healthy

3154.319 --> 3157.599
you won't might want to keep your

3155.839 --> 3160.48
distance from these people anyway

3157.599 --> 3162.559
see so if you feel comfortably

3160.48 --> 3164.48
comfortable not social distancing then

3162.559 --> 3166.3190000000004
just don't

3164.48 --> 3168.4
if there's people that want you to do

3166.319 --> 3169.839
that then you probably want to keep your

3168.4 --> 3172.2400000000002
distance from them anyway

3169.839 --> 3174.64
see so that's not even that much of a

3172.24 --> 3174.64
problem

3175.68 --> 3178.96
it's actually it reveals more of the

3177.599 --> 3180.559
symptoms who

3178.96 --> 3182.4
what type of people are caught up in

3180.559 --> 3183.2000000000003
this and the natural consequences that

3182.4 --> 3185.28
come with that

3183.2 --> 3188.5589999999997
you can basically point at it that way

3185.28 --> 3188.559
just like with the mask people

3192.0 --> 3197.28
but yeah well you guys know but what i

3194.8 --> 3197.28
mean like

3198.48 --> 3203.68
the other 10 million people talking

3201.839 --> 3208.5589999999997
about this on the internet

3203.68 --> 3210.48
so yeah

3208.559 --> 3212.48
what am i saying at 10 million probably

3210.48 --> 3223.839
100 million

3212.48 --> 3223.839
if not a billion like i don't know

3224.02 --> 3227.92
[Music]

3234.839 --> 3237.839
so

3254.24 --> 3265.839
okay yeah that's weird tiny momo

3275.96 --> 3279.079
[Music]

3290.839 --> 3293.839
okay

3304.839 --> 3307.839
do

3326.4 --> 3330.319
tonight covet is a thing

3331.119 --> 3337.119
oh it's not a infectious disease if if

3334.079 --> 3337.119
that's what you want to know

3337.52 --> 3340.799
it's more of a symptom

3342.64 --> 3346.8799999999997
it's the effect not a cause it's just

3346.079 --> 3349.76
part of the

3346.88 --> 3353.119
body's response mechanisms cleanup

3349.76 --> 3353.119
mechanism specifically

3355.119 --> 3358.319
it's a response to

3359.599 --> 3364.799
psychosomatic impulses and to general

3362.72 --> 3368.319
levels of toxicity

3364.799 --> 3370.96
being present and then

3368.319 --> 3372.4
the virus body starts to start to

3370.96 --> 3375.52
produce

3372.4 --> 3379.04
reproduce in order to yeah

3375.52 --> 3381.7599999999998
get a grip on the situation prevent

3379.04 --> 3383.599
atrophy local atrophy that's what

3381.76 --> 3385.8390000000004
viruses really do they clean it up

3383.599 --> 3386.48
prevent local atrophy but yet to do it

3385.839 --> 3390.48
they do

3386.48 --> 3392.72
sacrifice cells

3390.48 --> 3395.2
it's basically they it's a process where

3392.72 --> 3398.24
some cells are sacrificed to

3395.2 --> 3405.839
for the greater good for the rest that's

3398.24 --> 3405.839
what really happens

3430.839 --> 3433.839
so

3440.799 --> 3445.119
hooray symptoms completely different

3443.52 --> 3447.839
yeah it's still not an infectious

3445.119 --> 3447.839
disease though

3450.64 --> 3454.799
can be psychosomatically transferred

3457.04 --> 3463.52
and if your body's conditions are just

3460.24 --> 3466.8799999999997
not very good then yeah

3463.52 --> 3469.7599999999998
being physically exposed directly

3466.88 --> 3472.319
saliva and all that will i guess also

3469.76 --> 3473.92
typically trigger

3472.319 --> 3476.0
but that's like locked in also with

3473.92 --> 3479.2000000000003
psychosomatics and it's

3476.0 --> 3481.839
it comes from within the body not

3479.2 --> 3489.839
not from an infection from the outside

3481.839 --> 3489.839
it's just not how it works

3491.599 --> 3496.079
it's not even a virus tomorrow what

3498.24 --> 3503.839
well that that's it's not even

3501.44 --> 3503.839
well

3504.72 --> 3511.2799999999997
what is a virus you know it is probably

3508.48 --> 3512.0
a virus but what is that that's the

3511.28 --> 3515.52
issue

3512.0 --> 3518.72
what is a virus well the virus

3515.52 --> 3520.319
comes from the word poison even that's

3518.72 --> 3522.16
that's what it means it just means

3520.319 --> 3525.599
poison

3522.16 --> 3529.359
originally and what is suggested

3525.599 --> 3530.0
is it's an infections infectious agents

3529.359 --> 3533.2799999999997
like a very

3530.0 --> 3536.079
hostile bacteria that invades and just

3533.28 --> 3537.6800000000003
eats like an amoeba off it and then

3536.079 --> 3540.2400000000002
replicates

3537.68 --> 3542.16
right because there are bacteria sorts

3540.24 --> 3543.68
that do do that flesh-eating bacteria

3542.16 --> 3548.96
and all that

3543.68 --> 3551.7599999999998
but viruses are super microscopic

3548.96 --> 3553.92
and they're not anime they're not living

3551.76 --> 3554.3190000000004
mechanisms they can't really do anything

3553.92 --> 3557.92
they're

3554.319 --> 3558.48
only responsing so it's then suggested

3557.92 --> 3562.559
like they

3558.48 --> 3564.799
are ants in a giant ant farm system

3562.559 --> 3567.119
that despite not being animated do

3564.799 --> 3569.359
things because of the cycle

3567.119 --> 3570.6400000000003
like an interaction cycle with the

3569.359 --> 3573.7599999999998
organism well that's

3570.64 --> 3576.5589999999997
science fiction because it's not that's

3573.76 --> 3576.559
not what it is

3581.52 --> 3584.88
it's actually a mechanism that is part

3584.0 --> 3588.079
of the body

3584.88 --> 3589.6800000000003
it's a cleanup crew mechanism they're

3588.079 --> 3592.799
construction workers

3589.68 --> 3596.48
in uh what do you got

3592.799 --> 3598.839
in mammal type species

3596.48 --> 3600.48
and or what do you call in all animal

3598.839 --> 3602.319
species

3600.48 --> 3603.52
i don't think plants have it although

3602.319 --> 3606.799
yeah

3603.52 --> 3608.72
the cantaloupe did also get corona virus

3606.799 --> 3611.04
right

3608.72 --> 3613.9199999999996
i don't know maybe plants get it too

3611.04 --> 3614.799
it's it's biology it's just an inherent

3613.92 --> 3618.079
mechanism

3614.799 --> 3620.88
that's part of a bigger organism it's a

3618.079 --> 3620.88
useful tool

3621.599 --> 3628.0
and in yeah it literally people

3624.96 --> 3631.2
can get calls out of nothing

3628.0 --> 3634.4
not exposed to anyone carrying it

3631.2 --> 3636.16
even being isolated for very long times

3634.4 --> 3638.4
and then just suddenly because of

3636.16 --> 3641.44
certain conditions

3638.4 --> 3644.88
get a cold or like a really

3641.44 --> 3648.2400000000002
bad bronchitis out of nothing

3644.88 --> 3650.7200000000003
not an infection it's part of the body's

3648.24 --> 3652.8799999999997
mechanisms and they can't test

3650.72 --> 3654.3999999999996
themselves then for viruses or something

3652.88 --> 3657.28
and they will get it

3654.4 --> 3658.079
they will show like oh yeah you got it

3657.28 --> 3660.1600000000003
yeah

3658.079 --> 3665.119
not because they were infected but

3660.16 --> 3665.1189999999997
because the body basically created it

3665.359 --> 3670.88
because that's what it is right anyway

3668.72 --> 3672.799
i'm gonna round out the show

3670.88 --> 3674.7200000000003
probably gonna get demonetized for this

3672.799 --> 3677.2
i don't care

3674.72 --> 3678.64
this is what i've learned about biology

3677.2 --> 3683.52
and about the

3678.64 --> 3686.4
science fiction conception of viruses

3683.52 --> 3688.4
because there is such a thing as it's

3686.4 --> 3691.359
just that the story they tell you about

3688.4 --> 3691.359
it is incorrect

3691.839 --> 3698.5589999999997
there's even other scientific scientists

3695.44 --> 3701.119
and doctors that have

3698.559 --> 3702.559
yeah made testimonies and presentations

3701.119 --> 3706.48
about this

3702.559 --> 3709.2000000000003
and i yeah i echo that sentiment anyway

3706.48 --> 3711.44
thanks everyone for coming if you like
