83.2 --> 88.72
button

84.159 --> 92.4
that would be much appreciated so

88.72 --> 97.119
whether today is yeah

92.4 --> 100.32000000000001
dreary cloudy

97.119 --> 102.0
the wind isn't as aggressive as it was

100.32 --> 105.119
in the last few days

102.0 --> 105.6
so it's still a bit of a it's not wind

105.119 --> 110.799
still

105.6 --> 114.56
but yeah it seems like maybe this storm

110.799 --> 117.2
has finally gone down or

114.56 --> 117.2
receded

117.6 --> 122.64
but yeah it's still rainy and moist it's

120.719 --> 125.119
not raining right now but it has been

122.64 --> 125.119
pretty much

125.36 --> 132.56
the entire night so it is kind of moist

128.479 --> 134.8
it's not outside it's not cold

132.56 --> 135.84
but it's not really warm either it's

134.8 --> 138.239
just

135.84 --> 138.239
moist

139.04 --> 146.16
anyway hello rocket blimps first in chat

143.44 --> 146.16
good to see you

147.04 --> 157.84
it's monday the 24th

150.56 --> 157.84
of april 2021

160.16 --> 165.76
and yeah it don't feel exactly optimal

163.28 --> 165.76
right now

165.92 --> 170.72
because it was very late last night like

168.48 --> 174.23899999999998
five o'clock it's just incredible

170.72 --> 174.239
how time slipped by

176.16 --> 180.959
doesn't really feel too great when that

178.0 --> 184.56
happens in the next day

180.959 --> 187.68
yeah also yeah

184.56 --> 189.2
i think i made it i made a bit of an

187.68 --> 193.04000000000002
error in my diet

189.2 --> 195.83999999999997
because i yeah i bought cheese again

193.04 --> 196.64
it's been a long time over a year i

195.84 --> 199.84
think

196.64 --> 202.48
since i even did that and

199.84 --> 204.31900000000002
yeah thought okay let's have a pizza

202.48 --> 207.76
with cheese for a change

204.319 --> 211.35999999999999
instead of salami

207.76 --> 212.319
but man it had much more impact than i

211.36 --> 215.68
had expected

212.319 --> 215.67999999999998
because i really felt it like

217.519 --> 220.959
it's it's a good reminder

221.519 --> 224.799
right i do tests

225.36 --> 232.31900000000002
and this was one and yeah it

229.28 --> 235.84
i don't handle it well so it

232.319 --> 237.35999999999999
it really is kind of a confirmation of

235.84 --> 238.879
what i've been doing in the last two

237.36 --> 242.4
years

238.879 --> 243.67999999999998
and yeah cheese it's just not gonna work

242.4 --> 246.959
out

243.68 --> 246.959
unfortunately for me

248.72 --> 254.319
so learn that lesson

252.159 --> 256.56
now of course yeah if if it was

254.319 --> 259.59999999999997
completely

256.56 --> 263.28000000000003
organically made

259.6 --> 266.32000000000005
without pasteurization then perhaps

263.28 --> 267.67999999999995
that effect would be less the negative

266.32 --> 271.199
impact

267.68 --> 272.479
but yeah even this this cheese which is

271.199 --> 275.759
organic made and

272.479 --> 278.71999999999997
it's a good quality it just

275.759 --> 278.72
didn't sit right

279.04 --> 284.56
of course i'm not used to it so that

281.12 --> 284.56
effect is even enhanced

285.04 --> 289.36
but it's good to know anyway

295.52 --> 301.12
ah youtube's just acting weird again

298.56 --> 301.12
blinking

304.72 --> 311.03900000000004
i hope that changes soon it's very

308.84 --> 313.44
annoying

311.039 --> 313.44
all right

317.84 --> 322.63899999999995
so yeah plenty of flutter debate

320.0 --> 327.039
premieres yesterday

322.639 --> 330.16
small snippets the sunday show which was

327.039 --> 330.8
of course uh from friday and it was a

330.16 --> 338.08000000000004
good show

330.8 --> 340.479
it was a lot of fun good hearing it back

338.08 --> 342.56
other than that kind of yeah the part of

340.479 --> 345.199
why why it was so late

342.56 --> 345.84
stuck playing a game had a good run in

345.199 --> 350.0
that game

345.84 --> 350.0
and then like forgot about the time

350.479 --> 357.59999999999997
also this morning right pretty much

353.84 --> 357.59999999999997
right until right before the show

359.36 --> 362.8
all right now remember yeah i watched

361.199 --> 366.56
this video of annette

362.8 --> 368.8
some anatomy video basically about the

366.56 --> 370.72
influence of alcohol but it was really

368.8 --> 372.08
interesting i posted it in the flat

370.72 --> 375.52000000000004
earth earlier chat

372.08 --> 376.71999999999997
it was interesting because the guy

375.52 --> 380.08
actually

376.72 --> 383.12
like had a physical like

380.08 --> 385.68
set of organs and all that so yeah it

383.12 --> 386.4
was really like biology class it's very

385.68 --> 389.44
detailed

386.4 --> 389.84
so that was interesting to actually have

389.44 --> 392.71999999999997
him

389.84 --> 392.71999999999997
point at the

393.84 --> 397.11999999999995
well that is just a set of i think i

395.919 --> 399.919
guess sort of dried up

397.12 --> 401.52
conserved organs kind of disgusting like

399.919 --> 405.039
that but

401.52 --> 406.79999999999995
yeah i don't know i still thought it was

405.039 --> 411.84
very interesting uh

406.8 --> 415.44
piece of biology class hey hello agm

411.84 --> 415.44
good to see you good to see you

418.16 --> 425.12
right uh but yeah stop playing that game

422.08 --> 425.44
and i lit listened 24 7 discord didn't

425.12 --> 428.639
really

425.44 --> 429.199
didn't join it but as i was playing my

428.639 --> 432.88
game

429.199 --> 433.759
listening to 24 7 discord for like hours

432.88 --> 437.919
on end

433.759 --> 441.84000000000003
until like the video time for it ran

437.919 --> 444.24
out it was a very interesting uh

441.84 --> 446.56
lesson they talked about all kinds of

444.24 --> 446.56
things

449.039 --> 454.479
i don't remember what didn't make any

451.919 --> 456.79999999999995
notes of it was just playing the game

454.479 --> 456.8
uh

462.84 --> 470.87899999999996
right

465.759 --> 470.879
yeah and that was it for my day

476.84 --> 481.67999999999995
yesterday

479.44 --> 483.039
right right now i'm feeling a little

481.68 --> 486.879
queasy or rather

483.039 --> 491.599
cheesy because of that

486.879 --> 494.96000000000004
and yeah now i know

491.599 --> 494.96
is not for me anymore

496.72 --> 507.84000000000003
right so yeah how are you guys doing

516.24 --> 521.839
hello seeking stir water good to see you

571.12 --> 574.24
all right yeah sorry just checking my

573.279 --> 576.399
email

574.24 --> 578.399
because this is some yeah some technical

576.399 --> 582.08
things

578.399 --> 585.92
the gti trying to rearrange

582.08 --> 588.88
to make sure nothing like goes to error

585.92 --> 590.24
it is a bit of a hassle sometimes but

588.88 --> 592.88
yeah everything pretty much

590.24 --> 593.76
going well dairy doesn't bother me but

592.88 --> 596.0
alcohol does

593.76 --> 596.0
okay

597.12 --> 600.0
you love cheese

601.12 --> 606.0
well i used to eat a lot of cheese but

603.92 --> 608.88
since i've taken it out i think

606.0 --> 610.48
i'm doing better so it's not like i have

608.88 --> 613.92
like a

610.48 --> 616.0790000000001
total lactose intolerance or something

613.92 --> 619.1999999999999
it's just that i don't know maybe it's

616.079 --> 621.5999999999999
because of the age that does make sense

619.2 --> 621.6
also

624.0 --> 633.839
but i guess that for you that it's not

625.92 --> 633.8389999999999
the same

640.48 --> 644.0790000000001
with alcohol for me what i really

642.48 --> 646.0
learned about it is that

644.079 --> 647.92
it's just important that there's plenty

646.0 --> 650.64
of recovery time

647.92 --> 652.4799999999999
before i go to sleep so that i'm

650.64 --> 653.92
actually when i go to sleep that i'm

652.48 --> 655.519
sober

653.92 --> 657.92
that seems to matter a lot it's

655.519 --> 659.6
interesting also because the anatomy

657.92 --> 661.76
video

659.6 --> 662.64
now i'll just post it so you guys can

661.76 --> 665.36
watch it

662.64 --> 665.36
at some point

667.6 --> 671.36
but it actually yeah

672.399 --> 676.8
it is addressed like how chemically it

675.2 --> 680.0
gets in the way of certain

676.8 --> 683.279
protein uh synthesis

680.0 --> 685.04
in the body process like yeah

683.279 --> 687.36
including like muscle development and

685.04 --> 689.8389999999999
then if you still have like

687.36 --> 693.6
our yeah if you're is still processing

689.839 --> 696.32
the alcohol which goes in several phases

693.6 --> 698.24
then that's going to include influence

696.32 --> 701.279
the synthesis of protein which

698.24 --> 704.0
typically happens when you sleep so it's

701.279 --> 705.519
it was kind of cool watching that and

704.0 --> 708.24
then realizing

705.519 --> 708.64
that my strategy concerning alcohol that

708.24 --> 710.88
that

708.64 --> 713.279
actually does matter like there's

710.88 --> 715.279
there's physical

713.279 --> 716.72
biological proof for that and that's

715.279 --> 718.959
interesting

716.72 --> 718.9590000000001
right

720.72 --> 724.0790000000001
so to me yeah drinking alcohol not too

722.959 --> 727.4399999999999
much of course

724.079 --> 729.4399999999999
but it matters a lot that that i get it

727.44 --> 732.0790000000001
out of my system

729.44 --> 733.12
that i don't really noticing much about

732.079 --> 735.519
it anymore

733.12 --> 737.68
when i go to sleep because if it's still

735.519 --> 738.72
there if you're like spinny when i go to

737.68 --> 743.279
sleep

738.72 --> 743.279
then usually the repercussions

743.36 --> 750.0
will be much more dramatic and there is

746.48 --> 752.16
physical proof why so that's interesting

750.0 --> 754.24
because yeah you do regenerate during

752.16 --> 758.0
your sleep

754.24 --> 761.04
and start to synthesize protein put it

758.0 --> 764.959
all into place and all that so

761.04 --> 764.959
yeah is i don't know what's interesting

766.079 --> 773.8389999999999
didn't say anything about cheese though

785.36 --> 791.839
right so yeah i'm pretty much open for

789.04 --> 801.8389999999999
any discussion it's of course two hour

791.839 --> 801.839
show today

805.12 --> 811.76
oh yeah i almost forgot i was also

808.24 --> 813.36
through rt came yeah posted it in early

811.76 --> 815.6
bird chat too

813.36 --> 817.12
i don't know who still keeps track in

815.6 --> 818.9590000000001
there

817.12 --> 821.44
often i get a lot of responses from

818.959 --> 821.4399999999999
samson

822.32 --> 826.88
i haven't seen him active around

825.44 --> 829.7600000000001
recently

826.88 --> 830.959
but yeah i was looking into like israel

829.76 --> 834.3199999999999
and all that

830.959 --> 837.4399999999999
there's this group of jews and like an

834.32 --> 839.0400000000001
organization they're small i don't know

837.44 --> 841.2790000000001
how small it is

839.04 --> 845.36
they were just having a speech of

841.279 --> 845.36
basically like how to stop the

846.399 --> 853.44
the war with palestine and all that

849.6 --> 855.76
like in in intricate detail of like

853.44 --> 857.7600000000001
what the religious groups really are and

855.76 --> 860.48
how the laws works and

857.76 --> 862.88
i don't know it was interesting to look

860.48 --> 864.9590000000001
through that

862.88 --> 867.6
so i did also watch that somewhere in

864.959 --> 867.5999999999999
the afternoon

868.839 --> 871.839
uh

872.0 --> 877.199
oh yeah but anyway

880.32 --> 886.8000000000001
ask me questions ask me to

884.079 --> 899.8389999999999
explain things and i'll do it that's

886.8 --> 899.8389999999999
what i do here on the show

938.839 --> 941.839
so

942.639 --> 947.759
maybe it's a bit of a slow monday

944.399 --> 955.839
morning for a whole bunch of people

947.759 --> 955.839
yeah it is monday so

967.759 --> 973.12
troll-free zone oh yeah yesterday too by

971.199 --> 983.8389999999999
the way

973.12 --> 983.839
you know they they come in waves

983.92 --> 991.759
yeah trolls usually come rolling in

987.44 --> 995.6800000000001
when there is like damage control effort

991.759 --> 998.9590000000001
necessarily like if somebody did

995.68 --> 1001.4399999999999
like a stream it went viral

998.959 --> 1002.0
in their community and flat earthers

1001.44 --> 1005.0400000000001
started

1002.0 --> 1008.079
maybe pointing out like oh you

1005.04 --> 1011.519
you made another mistake

1008.079 --> 1013.7589999999999
and then i don't know

1011.519 --> 1014.8
like people from the flat earth debates

1013.759 --> 1017.04
and all that and

1014.8 --> 1019.3599999999999
the general flat earther community pick

1017.04 --> 1022.079
up on it start making videos that's when

1019.36 --> 1023.92
then the trolls come rolling out then

1022.079 --> 1026.48
they feel like oh they need to do damage

1023.92 --> 1027.76
control and nag everybody and straw man

1026.48 --> 1031.439
them

1027.76 --> 1031.439
but apparently nothing really

1031.76 --> 1037.679
happened this weekend

1035.039 --> 1040.48
notice i don't even know why i had a

1037.679 --> 1043.8390000000002
notification of that

1040.48 --> 1046.72
but brenda went live yesterday

1043.839 --> 1049.28
against some flat earther it didn't last

1046.72 --> 1049.28
very long

1050.84 --> 1055.4399999999998
octangelo don't know who that is i

1053.6 --> 1057.28
didn't actually really watch it i just

1055.44 --> 1060.88
noticed it went live and that like i

1057.28 --> 1064.16
have a notification for that what

1060.88 --> 1067.8400000000001
how did that happen but

1064.16 --> 1067.8400000000001
oh well

1080.799 --> 1086.32
right so yeah troll-free zone it's kind

1084.08 --> 1087.039
of nice and relaxing i guess but on the

1086.32 --> 1090.8799999999999
other hand

1087.039 --> 1092.799
when ballers get in here

1090.88 --> 1094.48
doing their thing they do kind of wake

1092.799 --> 1098.32
up people and i like that

1094.48 --> 1098.32
because then i get a more active chat

1100.96 --> 1104.32
otherwise you guys just put on my show i

1103.919 --> 1106.4
guess

1104.32 --> 1107.52
listen to me in the background as you do

1106.4 --> 1110.5590000000002
chores

1107.52 --> 1112.32
i guess it's something people

1110.559 --> 1114.08
get into the habit of doing you know

1112.32 --> 1117.12
it's good to

1114.08 --> 1118.559
find stuff that on a regular basis in

1117.12 --> 1120.6399999999999
your habit pattern

1118.559 --> 1124.16
you can listen to while you do the

1120.64 --> 1127.6000000000001
chores i remember that myself

1124.16 --> 1130.72
like in many ways

1127.6 --> 1132.8799999999999
especially like 10 years ago it was all

1130.72 --> 1133.52
more fresh i did that with like alex

1132.88 --> 1136.64
jones

1133.52 --> 1138.799
constantly listen to him like

1136.64 --> 1140.96
pretty much hours on end but yeah to

1138.799 --> 1143.28
just staring at the screen for

1140.96 --> 1144.48
three hours or just getting active

1143.28 --> 1148.3999999999999
finding things

1144.48 --> 1151.52
googling stuff sometimes

1148.4 --> 1154.64
there's just things you need to do

1151.52 --> 1156.48
out there clean up or whatever and then

1154.64 --> 1158.4
having things on in the background yeah

1156.48 --> 1161.52
that's nice

1158.4 --> 1163.1200000000001
for my show however i personally have a

1161.52 --> 1164.96
bit of objection

1163.12 --> 1166.8799999999999
against that habit because then you

1164.96 --> 1170.4
don't interact with my chat

1166.88 --> 1170.4
like i really need you here

1170.88 --> 1177.5200000000002
because i work off my chat

1174.16 --> 1180.88
right when i get people in chat

1177.52 --> 1183.9189999999999
they forward me questions then

1180.88 --> 1183.919
i know like

1185.6 --> 1189.039
well like technically i could just roll

1188.48 --> 1192.16
out

1189.039 --> 1193.28
subjects it's just for me it's a little

1192.16 --> 1197.2
difficult to get

1193.28 --> 1198.48
the hook to get me going and if somebody

1197.2 --> 1202.159
asks the question

1198.48 --> 1204.32
then that is the hook then i have like a

1202.159 --> 1206.96
reason to do it

1204.32 --> 1208.24
other than to just keep on talking and

1206.96 --> 1211.52
lay things down

1208.24 --> 1214.08
that's why i like chat

1211.52 --> 1214.08
questions

1215.76 --> 1219.039
compared to most i guess i put a loop on

1217.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
it

1219.039 --> 1221.84
but yeah

1222.08 --> 1228.08
in order for me to do that i actually

1224.559 --> 1228.08
need people active in chat

1232.64 --> 1236.0
and hey i'll address pretty much

1234.559 --> 1239.6789999999999
anything

1236.0 --> 1242.159
as long as it it yeah it's relevant

1239.679 --> 1246.3200000000002
right so if people are going to ask me

1242.159 --> 1246.3200000000002
basic questions like how old are you

1246.64 --> 1250.5590000000002
or is that a crossbow behind you yeah

1249.84 --> 1254.0
that's not an

1250.559 --> 1254.0
interesting question right

1256.0 --> 1259.44
like what am i gonna talk about about

1258.08 --> 1261.1999999999998
that that's

1259.44 --> 1262.64
just annoying right if you just

1261.2 --> 1266.24
genuinely want to know

1262.64 --> 1268.3200000000002
at some point like after

1266.24 --> 1270.159
having an interesting conversation then

1268.32 --> 1272.32
i'd understand and i have no objection

1270.159 --> 1275.6000000000001
but if you get in here and only ask

1272.32 --> 1278.3999999999999
that and then just nothing else yeah

1275.6 --> 1279.52
it's not like you can just insert some

1278.4 --> 1282.159
random

1279.52 --> 1284.24
yes or no or basic answer question like

1282.159 --> 1285.2800000000002
a coin into a machine and then i'll keep

1284.24 --> 1288.48
going that's not

1285.28 --> 1291.84
how i work it requires actual

1288.48 --> 1291.84
intellectual participation

1294.64 --> 1307.24
hello shatner's bassoon

1304.06 --> 1307.24
[Music]

1312.23 --> 1315.769
[Music]

1326.64 --> 1330.159
okay seeking star wars

1330.32 --> 1336.1589999999999
this nasa or yeah nasa

1334.32 --> 1338.48
how can they send communications from

1336.159 --> 1341.5200000000002
worse in possible distance what's

1338.48 --> 1343.2
their supposed tech well i think that

1341.52 --> 1347.84
they claim that you can send

1343.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
radio even into outer space

1349.28 --> 1354.3999999999999
like how how that actually works is a

1352.559 --> 1355.44
bit of a mystery because of course there

1354.4 --> 1358.3200000000002
is no fast

1355.44 --> 1359.44
gap of space anywhere in order to truly

1358.32 --> 1361.12
test it

1359.44 --> 1362.48
they might have tested like sending

1361.12 --> 1365.32
radio signals through

1362.48 --> 1367.919
vacuum and it's i've heard this

1365.32 --> 1370.08
visualization of what supposedly happens

1367.919 --> 1372.5590000000002
that

1370.08 --> 1374.24
yeah the radio signal kind of compacts

1372.559 --> 1377.9189999999999
into what they say is it

1374.24 --> 1378.96
is a laser right i always thought that

1377.919 --> 1381.8400000000001
was a bit weird

1378.96 --> 1383.52
so maybe that is what they will claim

1381.84 --> 1386.24
it's like you know they send the signal

1383.52 --> 1390.08
and then it compacts like a laser

1386.24 --> 1393.1200000000001
through space and there because there's

1390.08 --> 1393.6789999999999
barely any material to distort the

1393.12 --> 1396.6399999999999
signal

1393.679 --> 1397.3600000000001
it would be lossless and that way it can

1396.64 --> 1400.72
carry

1397.36 --> 1405.28
at these astronomical distances

1400.72 --> 1405.28
although there would always be a delay

1406.159 --> 1412.72
there would always be some delay so

1409.6 --> 1416.9599999999998
how do they do that supposedly well

1412.72 --> 1420.74
through radio probably some special

1416.96 --> 1423.2
space radio to make it even quicker but

1420.74 --> 1426.64
[Music]

1423.2 --> 1429.679
of course it's all made up because there

1426.64 --> 1433.6000000000001
is no outer space there is no

1429.679 --> 1437.2
distance of 33 million miles within

1433.6 --> 1437.1999999999998
within the physical reality

1438.08 --> 1444.6399999999999
or well it's not very likely right

1442.4 --> 1447.44
technically it could be possible that

1444.64 --> 1450.64
there is a distance of 33 million miles

1447.44 --> 1453.2
if there were to be many

1450.64 --> 1455.2
more realm segments directly connected

1453.2 --> 1458.159
to ours north and south of us

1455.2 --> 1459.76
then maybe right but it's very unlikely

1458.159 --> 1462.4
and the 33 million is

1459.76 --> 1464.32
a lot of distance don't think there's

1462.4 --> 1467.6000000000001
that much

1464.32 --> 1467.6
earth surface really

1470.88 --> 1474.64
special space radio of course

1475.14 --> 1478.189
[Music]

1478.559 --> 1487.84
hello tom parker

1491.2 --> 1493.52
right

1496.24 --> 1502.48
nixon has a bad phone to the moon

1500.159 --> 1505.0390000000002
then sure sure yeah i was just about to

1502.48 --> 1507.6
bring that up

1505.039 --> 1509.76
because that was even sillier because of

1507.6 --> 1509.76
the

1510.0 --> 1515.76
yeah that was like 60s radio technology

1513.84 --> 1518.48
or maybe a little better because of

1515.76 --> 1522.4
secret development whatever

1518.48 --> 1523.44
but yeah to have such a direct

1522.4 --> 1526.72
connection

1523.44 --> 1527.3600000000001
with so little with like no virtually no

1526.72 --> 1529.6000000000001
delay

1527.36 --> 1531.76
that's ridiculous like there would

1529.6 --> 1534.08
always be a delay the further that

1531.76 --> 1535.039
presupposed distance the longer the

1534.08 --> 1538.559
delay

1535.039 --> 1538.559
and they didn't really get that right

1538.799 --> 1544.0
hey tomonoid three six nine

1547.6 --> 1552.6399999999999
inverse square law make the brightness

1549.52 --> 1557.84
of stars in tenable

1552.64 --> 1557.8400000000001
well in the current model

1561.76 --> 1568.799
but there's also yeah the issue of

1565.76 --> 1572.559
like infrasquare law

1568.799 --> 1575.2
how do how is it affected in a vacuum

1572.559 --> 1575.84
right because we all know that light

1575.2 --> 1579.919
gets

1575.84 --> 1582.32
of course absorbed by material even air

1579.919 --> 1584.0
even gases transparent gases that it

1582.32 --> 1587.36
passes through over distance

1584.0 --> 1590.08
it will have like uh refracting effects

1587.36 --> 1593.36
causing it to become incohesive and then

1590.08 --> 1593.36
you don't really pick it up

1596.159 --> 1600.3200000000002
so i do wonder like does the infrasquare

1598.799 --> 1603.76
law

1600.32 --> 1606.6399999999999
work in a vacuum or

1603.76 --> 1607.2
yeah does the vacuum actually cause the

1606.64 --> 1613.8400000000001
full

1607.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
power of the light to transfer right

1615.12 --> 1621.1999999999998
and that could technically be tested

1618.72 --> 1622.08
like if you really wanted to test it

1621.2 --> 1624.32
properly

1622.08 --> 1627.9189999999999
you'd need a very large vacuum chamber

1624.32 --> 1630.799
so that the giant chamber from nasa

1627.919 --> 1634.0
would probably be very helpful in

1630.799 --> 1637.039
figuring that out specifically

1634.0 --> 1641.36
like does the infrasquare law actually

1637.039 --> 1644.399
still apply to light if it's in a vacuum

1641.36 --> 1647.76
does anybody know was that already

1644.399 --> 1650.1589999999999
taken into account with the infrasquare

1647.76 --> 1653.2
law or is it more like a

1650.159 --> 1656.0800000000002
rule of fist law based on the dynamics

1653.2 --> 1656.64
of the actual real world system where

1656.08 --> 1659.76
there is

1656.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
gas pressure everywhere

1659.76 --> 1669.84
because it's contained

1670.559 --> 1677.9189999999999
um see but this is what i see people

1673.84 --> 1679.6789999999999
bringing in the subject thinking with me

1677.919 --> 1683.8400000000001
and now there's a discussion now got

1679.679 --> 1683.8400000000001
something to go on

1685.039 --> 1689.44
what vacuum well it's all

1687.96 --> 1691.279
presuppositional right

1689.44 --> 1694.159
if you're going to presuppose that there

1691.279 --> 1697.12
is a super far distance communication to

1694.159 --> 1699.279
another planet then with that you

1697.12 --> 1701.6789999999999
presuppose also that there's a vacuum in

1699.279 --> 1701.679
between

1703.279 --> 1708.72
and so that's going to influence it

1706.48 --> 1710.24
if you presuppose that setup right if

1708.72 --> 1712.96
you presuppose that it's

1710.24 --> 1714.559
actually set up like that and then you

1712.96 --> 1718.24
could test it you could test

1714.559 --> 1722.08
like okay will vacuum make

1718.24 --> 1725.279
radio signals go quicker

1722.08 --> 1729.52
is that a thing and does vacuum

1725.279 --> 1729.52
influence the infrasquare law of light

1733.2 --> 1739.8400000000001
yeah thank you seeking star wars

1758.64 --> 1763.6000000000001
and i i wonder if anybody ever addressed

1761.679 --> 1765.8400000000001
that even

1763.6 --> 1767.4399999999998
like with light inverse square laws yeah

1765.84 --> 1771.9189999999999
we get it

1767.44 --> 1774.72
but what actually causes the light to

1771.919 --> 1774.72
become less

1776.159 --> 1782.5590000000002
right it's kind of like over distance

1779.52 --> 1783.279
it splits up so the intensity it splits

1782.559 --> 1785.6
up so there

1783.279 --> 1785.6
i guess

1786.88 --> 1792.48
it it would still stand

1790.24 --> 1793.44
in for square law because it's not as

1792.48 --> 1795.1200000000001
much about how

1793.44 --> 1797.1200000000001
much of the light is being absorbed

1795.12 --> 1799.84
rather than

1797.12 --> 1801.12
yeah the actual source presumed to be a

1799.84 --> 1803.52
specific surface

1801.12 --> 1805.6
giving off a certain intensity of light

1803.52 --> 1808.0
and then over distance

1805.6 --> 1808.6399999999999
that light yeah since it's going in all

1808.0 --> 1812.48
directions

1808.64 --> 1815.3600000000001
f effectively splits up and that way

1812.48 --> 1816.96
the infrasquare law yeah decreases the

1815.36 --> 1819.84
amount of light that will eventually

1816.96 --> 1819.8400000000001
reach the target

1821.6 --> 1827.1999999999998
all right it's a good question to ask

1823.6 --> 1827.1999999999998
right to think about that

1831.039 --> 1839.919
right so maybe the inverse square law

1836.48 --> 1842.96
does take the absorption of

1839.919 --> 1846.159
of light by gases into account

1842.96 --> 1848.08
it's just that yeah

1846.159 --> 1850.0800000000002
that it doesn't matter that much in the

1848.08 --> 1852.72
face of it that maybe the amount of

1850.08 --> 1857.12
light output from the original source

1852.72 --> 1861.039
having or yeah effectively decreasing

1857.12 --> 1864.32
over distance as much as how it is

1861.039 --> 1868.48
being received by the other end

1864.32 --> 1879.84
that yeah that that still counts

1868.48 --> 1879.84
that it still won't work i wonder right

1887.2 --> 1891.039
the moon's surface should be blinding

1889.519 --> 1896.3990000000001
bright

1891.039 --> 1896.399
yeah the way that we see it

1904.96 --> 1910.799
ah seems some of the trolls have finally

1907.279 --> 1910.799
found their way into the chat

1915.12 --> 1920.559
presupposing a dome that's nice don't

1918.399 --> 1922.7199999999998
really claim a literal dome

1920.559 --> 1925.519
right dome implies a certain shape i

1922.72 --> 1927.6000000000001
don't claim that shape

1925.519 --> 1928.88
if you'd if you would have said to the

1927.6 --> 1930.8799999999999
flat top

1928.88 --> 1932.24
i would be actually more willing to

1930.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
entertain

1932.24 --> 1935.84
that question

1936.32 --> 1941.12
because how far could we

1941.36 --> 1949.76
derive the container wall to have to be

1945.919 --> 1950.0800000000002
roughly based on well the dynamics of

1949.76 --> 1953.2
the

1950.08 --> 1955.76
system around us the air

1953.2 --> 1957.6000000000001
how much it decreases in pressure over

1955.76 --> 1960.799
distance

1957.6 --> 1964.559
the pattern of it we might be able to

1960.799 --> 1968.559
calculate based on just that as to where

1964.559 --> 1970.96
it is most likely the container wall

1968.559 --> 1971.9189999999999
wall flat top that's what i think is

1970.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
more likely

1971.919 --> 1977.8400000000001
should be roughly

1999.12 --> 2006.9599999999998
yeah well yes joseph369

2004.88 --> 2008.72
see light from the stars in the

2006.96 --> 2011.8400000000001
atmosphere when you go up

2008.72 --> 2014.64
it seems to not be as pronounced

2011.84 --> 2014.6399999999999
that's true but

2016.48 --> 2022.08
yeah good point of course but with

2019.84 --> 2024.8799999999999
that notion you also bypass the

2022.08 --> 2027.76
presupposition of the

2024.88 --> 2028.64
of the model heliocentric model setup of

2027.76 --> 2030.96
course

2028.64 --> 2032.24
because they require all those things to

2030.96 --> 2035.679
be physical and at

2032.24 --> 2035.679
astronomical distances

2036.32 --> 2040.559
but yeah in reality the celestial sphere

2039.6 --> 2043.84
all the stars

2040.559 --> 2046.6399999999999
moon sun planets they're just

2043.84 --> 2048.0
light holographic light to be more

2046.64 --> 2051.04
precise

2048.0 --> 2053.679
they don't seem to be originating from

2051.04 --> 2057.04
objects in euclidean space anywhere it's

2053.679 --> 2057.04
rather light manifest

2057.52 --> 2062.079
and there does seem to be a direct

2059.44 --> 2065.599
correlation between

2062.079 --> 2068.079
the visibility of them and being closer

2065.599 --> 2069.9190000000003
to the surface where of the earth where

2068.079 --> 2072.96
there just so happened to be

2069.919 --> 2075.359
more air pressure so is there a direct

2072.96 --> 2077.119
correlation to the celestial light

2075.359 --> 2081.52
manifestation

2077.119 --> 2089.839
and the amount of air pressure there is

2081.52 --> 2089.839
could be

2112.24 --> 2119.7599999999998
could it be sound frequency well

2115.68 --> 2119.7599999999998
no i don't think it's sound really

2120.16 --> 2126.56
it's light the stars

2123.359 --> 2128.48
celestial sphere lights they're light

2126.56 --> 2130.48
right the light is really the only thing

2128.48 --> 2134.4
that can be

2130.48 --> 2134.4
definitely observed about it

2142.4 --> 2147.04
right and things like sound is is

2145.28 --> 2150.48
different

2147.04 --> 2152.64
because yeah sound is

2150.48 --> 2156.96
what is sound sound is actually the

2152.64 --> 2156.96
vibration of physical material so

2157.44 --> 2165.04
literal holographic sound

2161.359 --> 2167.92
is not really possible although you can

2165.04 --> 2168.4
yeah you can sort of on the other hand

2167.92 --> 2170.839
make

2168.4 --> 2172.2400000000002
holographic effects where you can just

2170.839 --> 2174.32
like

2172.24 --> 2177.1189999999997
like even with sound technology this has

2174.32 --> 2179.6800000000003
been perfected for decades

2177.119 --> 2180.2400000000002
we can just like have multiple sources

2179.68 --> 2182.48
create

2180.24 --> 2185.1189999999997
like this certain type of wave and where

2182.48 --> 2185.119
they cross

2185.44 --> 2188.56
it's very complicated very refined there

2188.16 --> 2191.2
yeah

2188.56 --> 2193.44
then you can like almost have local

2191.2 --> 2197.5989999999997
sound effects that you will

2193.44 --> 2200.48
be able to triangulate with your brain

2197.599 --> 2201.599
but yeah that's just like physical

2200.48 --> 2203.92
holograms

2201.599 --> 2204.88
of light that we make with technology

2203.92 --> 2207.6800000000003
that those are

2204.88 --> 2208.7200000000003
definitely originating from a certain

2207.68 --> 2211.2
location

2208.72 --> 2211.9199999999996
also those sound holograms you don't see

2211.2 --> 2214.64
them over

2211.92 --> 2217.04
fast distance you only see them or list

2214.64 --> 2219.1189999999997
here so what am i saying

2217.04 --> 2220.24
the sound you can only hear them in

2219.119 --> 2223.04
proximity

2220.24 --> 2224.9599999999996
to it right while with a hologram that

2223.04 --> 2227.119
is being projected you can see that over

2224.96 --> 2230.0
a vast distance

2227.119 --> 2230.8
there's a big difference so i don't

2230.0 --> 2233.599
think that

2230.8 --> 2235.28
the celestial lights are literally

2233.599 --> 2238.32
directly caused by

2235.28 --> 2241.52
sound in any way because that

2238.32 --> 2244.079
yeah i don't foresee how that can be

2241.52 --> 2245.92
done in any way

2244.079 --> 2247.92
so although i might be wrong maybe it is

2245.92 --> 2257.839
sound but it's so difficult

2247.92 --> 2257.839
to even imagine how that could work

2258.079 --> 2264.5600000000004
right there's no real sign of sound

2261.359 --> 2268.7999999999997
being involved directly

2264.56 --> 2271.839
like it's just the light and sound

2268.8 --> 2275.28
in any form can't just be

2271.839 --> 2278.7999999999997
made to create light without

2275.28 --> 2280.7200000000003
any sound being there

2278.8 --> 2282.1600000000003
involved with it and also being

2280.72 --> 2284.72
measurable right

2282.16 --> 2286.0
so there's no way that i know that you

2284.72 --> 2289.2799999999997
can actually use

2286.0 --> 2293.119
sound to directly create light without

2289.28 --> 2293.119
the sound being detectable in the

2296.839 --> 2299.839
process

2300.32 --> 2304.88
frequency yeah but a frequency is a

2303.04 --> 2308.079
concept

2304.88 --> 2312.4
a frequency of what right a frequency

2308.079 --> 2313.76
is a is a pattern unless it is has a

2312.4 --> 2316.8
substance then

2313.76 --> 2319.76
frequency or what

2316.8 --> 2321.44
right frequency a light frequency is

2319.76 --> 2326.2400000000002
sound

2321.44 --> 2328.32
uh like molecular frequency

2326.24 --> 2330.0
like what are the effective material

2328.32 --> 2332.079
sizes right you can have material

2330.0 --> 2334.96
frequency that you can use sound to

2332.079 --> 2335.3590000000004
basically find resonance and all that

2334.96 --> 2338.4
there's

2335.359 --> 2338.4
technology for that

2339.04 --> 2342.72
right frequency sound

2344.32 --> 2352.7200000000003
yeah that's like

2349.119 --> 2357.359
the oscillation frequency

2352.72 --> 2357.359
of material that's sound based

2362.0 --> 2370.4
okay seeking star wars really sound

2365.52 --> 2372.32
of earth from space really

2370.4 --> 2374.8
and what does that sound like is it just

2372.32 --> 2374.8
silence

2381.44 --> 2386.2400000000002
or is it the human resonance is it just

2384.0 --> 2386.24
that

2393.599 --> 2400.88
whales huh

2397.359 --> 2404.4
how are you supposed to hear whales

2400.88 --> 2407.6800000000003
through a vacuum i'm pretty sure that

2404.4 --> 2407.6800000000003
all forms of sound

2407.92 --> 2415.2000000000003
are still going to be

2411.76 --> 2417.28
waves of material of gas right that's

2415.2 --> 2418.0789999999997
what create that's what actually enables

2417.28 --> 2420.079
the sound

2418.079 --> 2421.28
sound is one of the things that actually

2420.079 --> 2426.1600000000003
does completely get

2421.28 --> 2429.119
isolated through vacuum probably

2426.16 --> 2439.2799999999997
it's even like used to detect whether

2429.119 --> 2452.7200000000003
there is a vacuum

2439.28 --> 2457.0400000000004
hello andrew

2452.72 --> 2457.04
sounds like metal and wheel singing

2457.92 --> 2460.2400000000002
okay

2461.92 --> 2467.839
oh that makes no sense though

2483.119 --> 2489.599
same thing as thunder and lightning

2486.24 --> 2491.359
no they are one in the same no

2489.599 --> 2493.44
no they're actually two distinct

2491.359 --> 2495.52
different things

2493.44 --> 2497.92
the lightning is the electrical

2495.52 --> 2500.48
connection lighting things up

2497.92 --> 2501.76
and the energy release of that is what

2500.48 --> 2504.2400000000002
creates

2501.76 --> 2506.3190000000004
the pressure shock waves we know as

2504.24 --> 2523.839
thunder

2506.319 --> 2523.839
so it's absolutely two different things

2526.319 --> 2532.56
and sound and frequency

2530.0 --> 2534.88
consequence of why not no there is sound

2532.56 --> 2535.359
and then there is the frequency of the

2534.88 --> 2538.6400000000003
sound

2535.359 --> 2541.68
right frequency is an element

2538.64 --> 2542.4
it's part of the spectrum of sound so

2541.68 --> 2545.04
it's

2542.4 --> 2548.0
yeah not a very good comparison but

2545.04 --> 2548.0
thank you for trying

2548.88 --> 2554.0
right but sound is not the only thing

2550.96 --> 2557.92
that has a frequency

2554.0 --> 2557.92
that that was part of my point earlier

2560.72 --> 2566.0789999999997
so if you just exclusively say frequency

2564.24 --> 2568.319
then that could mean a whole range of

2566.079 --> 2568.319
things

2570.64 --> 2575.92
right and it gets even more complicated

2575.359 --> 2579.04
when

2575.92 --> 2582.56
yeah when you bring in all other fields

2579.04 --> 2585.839
because i use the word frequency for

2582.56 --> 2588.4
non-physics related things as well like

2585.839 --> 2589.52
the frequency of the spirit that's a

2588.4 --> 2592.64
whole other deal

2589.52 --> 2595.2
that's also considered as a frequency

2592.64 --> 2596.319
by basically comes comparing spirit

2595.2 --> 2598.48
activity

2596.319 --> 2607.839
to the light spectrum which is

2598.48 --> 2607.839
definitely frequency based

2612.24 --> 2615.839
right but if there is a frequency of

2614.96 --> 2618.16
something

2615.839 --> 2620.0
then there is a spectrum that's one

2618.16 --> 2622.319
conclusion that i've drawn

2620.0 --> 2623.68
intuitively a long time ago if there's a

2622.319 --> 2627.359
frequency

2623.68 --> 2627.359
you can change that means there's a

2632.839 --> 2635.839
spectrum

2652.64 --> 2658.319
yes joseph 369 the higher up you go the

2656.16 --> 2660.7999999999997
less you see

2658.319 --> 2661.599
of the celestial bodies right pointing

2660.8 --> 2664.48
at well

2661.599 --> 2667.28
the correlation of the mysterious

2664.48 --> 2670.88
celestial light phenomena

2667.28 --> 2673.599
and the thickness of the air

2670.88 --> 2674.88
there is a correlation now how that

2673.599 --> 2677.04
actually works

2674.88 --> 2678.8
is going to remain a little difficult

2677.04 --> 2680.48
since we can't really pinpoint the

2678.8 --> 2684.319
origin of the light

2680.48 --> 2684.319
can't really reverse engineer it

2684.8 --> 2690.8
yet maybe ever

2687.92 --> 2692.0
in order to truly understand the the

2690.8 --> 2694.4
direct

2692.0 --> 2696.56
relation whether there is a causal

2694.4 --> 2698.56
relation in any way

2696.56 --> 2699.599
between the celestial light

2698.56 --> 2702.64
manifestations

2699.599 --> 2704.8
and the air pressure locally

2702.64 --> 2707.04
right because it's already been pointed

2704.8 --> 2709.3590000000004
out that it's holographic so

2707.04 --> 2711.2
it's always going to be locally because

2709.359 --> 2714.48
a holographic thing is pretty much

2711.2 --> 2714.48
present everywhere

2714.64 --> 2718.56
like and nowhere it's not nowhere

2717.68 --> 2720.72
specific

2718.56 --> 2724.88
it's always in related in relation to

2720.72 --> 2724.8799999999997
the observer where there is an apparent

2730.839 --> 2733.839
location

2735.28 --> 2739.8390000000004
right so to say a product of

2741.04 --> 2746.96
that's direct that's basically claiming

2743.92 --> 2750.079
a causal relationship joseph

2746.96 --> 2752.7200000000003
and you can't really prove that

2750.079 --> 2755.2000000000003
there is only a correlation but we don't

2752.72 --> 2758.56
we can't really pinpoint the cause

2755.2 --> 2761.359
of the stars we can't isolate

2758.56 --> 2763.839
the phenomena are very manipulated in

2761.359 --> 2764.7999999999997
order to actually establish a literal

2763.839 --> 2768.24
cause

2764.8 --> 2770.88
and then yeah figuring out

2768.24 --> 2772.64
how how it actually manifests completely

2770.88 --> 2775.28
but there it does seem to be a direct

2772.64 --> 2778.319
correlation between

2775.28 --> 2780.4
the gas pressure

2778.319 --> 2789.839
in the location and the celestial

2780.4 --> 2789.839
manifestations to the observer

2806.96 --> 2812.56
a result of yeah still causal

2815.76 --> 2820.4
with frequency there will always be a

2818.56 --> 2824.0
reaction called sound

2820.4 --> 2826.319
no sorry andrew

2824.0 --> 2829.359
you're trying but it's wrong right

2826.319 --> 2832.56
there's light frequencies

2829.359 --> 2834.96
there is no proof that any sound is

2832.56 --> 2838.24
associated with that

2834.96 --> 2839.599
it doesn't if you make light frequencies

2838.24 --> 2840.0
change the frequency there's not going

2839.599 --> 2845.839
to be

2840.0 --> 2845.839
sound coming from that

2848.559 --> 2853.8390000000004
right frequency is is not exclusive to

2852.72 --> 2855.68
sound

2853.839 --> 2857.2
and that's just a fact there's other

2855.68 --> 2859.839
things with frequencies

2857.2 --> 2859.839
light

2863.68 --> 2873.839
lightning creates nitrogen okay

2866.96 --> 2873.839
that's interesting

2875.359 --> 2887.839
cymatics proves his point which point

2893.52 --> 2898.0
make audio files music from the stars

2899.119 --> 2906.6400000000003
yeah iron f e i i've heard about that oh

2903.44 --> 2906.64
the sound frequency

2908.0 --> 2912.319
is that literal like how are you even

2910.319 --> 2912.8
gonna isolate the sound coming from

2912.319 --> 2915.119
there

2912.8 --> 2918.119
it sounds rather like it's a similar

2915.119 --> 2921.28
process to uh

2918.119 --> 2925.839
spectroscopy but instead of

2921.28 --> 2930.1600000000003
like interpreting the color it's then

2925.839 --> 2930.64
somehow it into sound so i don't think

2930.16 --> 2933.839
there's

2930.64 --> 2937.2
literal sound coming off it

2933.839 --> 2940.88
not sure though like how are you gonna

2937.2 --> 2943.5989999999997
isolate the vibration

2940.88 --> 2944.079
from a point of holographic light in the

2943.599 --> 2946.559
sky

2944.079 --> 2947.76
like how are you going to isolate that

2946.559 --> 2949.92
right like

2947.76 --> 2951.3590000000004
sound is supposed to be coming to you

2949.92 --> 2954.839
through the atmosphere

2951.359 --> 2957.119
sound goes in all directions like what

2954.839 --> 2959.52
how

2957.119 --> 2960.2400000000002
that doesn't make any sense to me in a

2959.52 --> 2962.48
technical

2960.24 --> 2962.4799999999996
way

2964.72 --> 2967.839
so there might have been a little bit of

2966.559 --> 2970.4
wizardry

2967.839 --> 2970.88
inserted with that concept like oh the

2970.4 --> 2974.7200000000003
sound

2970.88 --> 2977.76
frequency from the stars

2974.72 --> 2979.1189999999997
it seems like wizardry to me are they

2977.76 --> 2981.3590000000004
actually going to pick up

2979.119 --> 2982.4
literal sound from that it sounds like

2981.359 --> 2986.319
it's a

2982.4 --> 2989.6800000000003
similar process to spectroscopy

2986.319 --> 2990.24
they just translate it to sound or

2989.68 --> 2993.359
something

2990.24 --> 2996.8799999999997
i don't know maybe i'm incorrect

2993.359 --> 2999.92
another mystery right celestial

2996.88 --> 3001.6800000000003
lights non-local holographic phenomena

2999.92 --> 3005.04
well maybe there is sound coming off

3001.68 --> 3005.04
that how does that work

3006.0 --> 3016.0
cymatics are visuals of sound no

3012.96 --> 3019.92
no cymatics

3016.0 --> 3023.04
is sound it's not visuals of sound

3019.92 --> 3026.44
it's the patterns of the the sound

3023.04 --> 3028.079
waves that will in cymatics

3026.44 --> 3030.88
demonstrations

3028.079 --> 3032.2400000000002
rearrange the materials in order for you

3030.88 --> 3035.6800000000003
to see

3032.24 --> 3039.359
a direct result of the sound

3035.68 --> 3041.9199999999996
influencing the material right

3039.359 --> 3044.0
because of pressure differentials that

3041.92 --> 3047.119
pressure differential patterns that come

3044.0 --> 3047.119
from the cymatics

3048.4 --> 3052.48
so it's not literally visual that's

3050.72 --> 3054.5589999999997
coming off the sound

3052.48 --> 3055.52
it's the sound that causes pressure

3054.559 --> 3060.0
differentials

3055.52 --> 3060.0
to reshape the materials

3060.079 --> 3066.48
and then you can see how how the shape

3064.48 --> 3069.04
is affecting the material that's what

3066.48 --> 3071.76
you get to see

3069.04 --> 3083.839
hey steli in 80 12. yeah doing great how

3071.76 --> 3083.8390000000004
are you

3100.079 --> 3105.2000000000003
to hear sound one must have an ear well

3102.4 --> 3108.88
you can still pick up vibrations

3105.2 --> 3110.16
even if you don't have an ear or on top

3108.88 --> 3113.92
of it

3110.16 --> 3118.24
right there's plenty of animals that

3113.92 --> 3121.839
use non-hearing based sonar

3118.24 --> 3125.839
to pick up things sharks do it

3121.839 --> 3127.839
bats do it it's not a hearing mechanism

3125.839 --> 3131.04
but they do

3127.839 --> 3134.96
use vibration of sounds even

3131.04 --> 3137.52
with the bats like non-hearable

3134.96 --> 3138.16
frequencies of sound in order to pick up

3137.52 --> 3140.64
things

3138.16 --> 3141.2799999999997
right and deaf people also feel sound

3140.64 --> 3145.44
that's right

3141.28 --> 3146.559
the vibrations like the earring is

3145.44 --> 3148.88
basically a fine

3146.559 --> 3149.92
tuning and amplifying mechanism to

3148.88 --> 3153.92
isolate

3149.92 --> 3166.559
details in sound right sound is just

3153.92 --> 3169.76
pressure is vibration and pressure

3166.559 --> 3172.2400000000002
bone phone no ear used yeah it is

3169.76 --> 3172.2400000000002
actually

3173.04 --> 3177.359
it's just that your bones are then used

3176.48 --> 3180.48
as a

3177.359 --> 3184.48
sound vibration conductor

3180.48 --> 3188.2400000000002
and because the air is connected to it

3184.48 --> 3188.2400000000002
that way it's transmitted

3188.4 --> 3195.28
so yeah you if you're going to make out

3191.839 --> 3198.16
sounds even through bone phone

3195.28 --> 3200.3190000000004
through that system it's because it's

3198.16 --> 3202.7999999999997
reaching your ear where the

3200.319 --> 3205.04
where it's being refined and translated

3202.8 --> 3209.8390000000004
to your brain so you pick it up as

3205.04 --> 3209.839
sound separate from just vibration

3222.88 --> 3231.04
the pyramids designed

3226.0 --> 3234.319
in the shape of the frequencies

3231.04 --> 3237.839
the stars emit what

3234.319 --> 3237.839
what does that mean andrew

3237.92 --> 3244.4
this is kind of a big claim there i

3240.8 --> 3251.8390000000004
don't know what you mean with that

3244.4 --> 3251.839
it seems a little vague

3255.52 --> 3265.28
whoa sees palm shape

3259.04 --> 3268.319
tree shapes missing well hmm

3265.28 --> 3268.88
that's weird joseph361 well that that

3268.319 --> 3271.44
could be

3268.88 --> 3271.44
simply the

3272.64 --> 3277.5989999999997
the visualization mechanism right behind

3276.079 --> 3280.0
the eye

3277.599 --> 3280.96
that it is playing tricks on him that it

3280.0 --> 3284.24
is kind of like

3280.96 --> 3287.92
dream memory inputting

3284.24 --> 3290.9599999999996
or something right

3287.92 --> 3293.839
when you visualize you

3290.96 --> 3294.799
you conjure images in your mind in order

3293.839 --> 3297.92
to visualize

3294.799 --> 3300.4
things you see shapes or whatever

3297.92 --> 3302.88
that's not literally your eyes seeing

3300.4 --> 3305.92
that that's the mechanism

3302.88 --> 3307.2000000000003
that translates the visuals and relays

3305.92 --> 3309.52
them to the brain

3307.2 --> 3310.64
that can do things separately from the

3309.52 --> 3313.68
eyes and kind of

3310.64 --> 3316.0789999999997
project things over the visuals

3313.68 --> 3317.44
right that mechanism could be the cause

3316.079 --> 3323.28
of

3317.44 --> 3323.28
yeah what your friend is experiencing

3324.24 --> 3329.359
the last thing the ice well that could

3326.24 --> 3335.839
be seeking star wars but

3329.359 --> 3335.839
doesn't have to be

3336.319 --> 3339.359
but yeah it does

3339.44 --> 3343.76
it does seem to be like a phantom limb

3342.24 --> 3349.839
or phantom pain type

3343.76 --> 3349.8390000000004
effect if that's the case weird

3355.76 --> 3365.599
yes iron iffy i've heard of that

3362.24 --> 3377.839
thinking speech can be picked up

3365.599 --> 3377.839
i've heard that it's very fascinating

3382.72 --> 3386.0789999999997
well andrew look

3387.04 --> 3390.079
i don't want to be mean or anything but

3389.2 --> 3392.799
where did you pick

3390.079 --> 3395.3590000000004
that up because that sounds like a whole

3392.799 --> 3396.48
bunch of new age wishy-washy nonsense to

3395.359 --> 3400.0789999999997
me

3396.48 --> 3402.2400000000002
and i don't say that easily i've heard

3400.079 --> 3404.1600000000003
this type of thing before oh pyramids

3402.24 --> 3406.3999999999996
and frequency and this and that

3404.16 --> 3406.3999999999996
but

3411.359 --> 3415.5989999999997
yeah you could have heard that story

3413.359 --> 3417.04
like how do you know any of that is true

3415.599 --> 3419.2000000000003
do you actually understand what they're

3417.04 --> 3421.599
talking about or does it just sound very

3419.2 --> 3422.72
fascinating i know pyramid star so it's

3421.599 --> 3425.119
fascinating

3422.72 --> 3426.0789999999997
right in the whole thing about giza

3425.119 --> 3429.2000000000003
pyramid

3426.079 --> 3429.599
with the weird tunnels in it and that

3429.2 --> 3432.64
were

3429.599 --> 3433.76
theorized like oh that yeah the way it's

3432.64 --> 3436.799
designed

3433.76 --> 3438.559
it shows like serious you could see it

3436.799 --> 3440.559
exactly through it there's something

3438.559 --> 3443.76
magical about that

3440.559 --> 3446.1600000000003
yeah i remember that part but that's

3443.76 --> 3448.6400000000003
about as far as it goes for me when yeah

3446.16 --> 3452.3999999999996
when it comes to

3448.64 --> 3455.04
any direct correlation with the stars

3452.4 --> 3456.319
so i don't know about this frequency of

3455.04 --> 3458.799
stars

3456.319 --> 3459.52
the frequency of a pyramid i know that

3458.799 --> 3463.44
shapes of

3459.52 --> 3463.44
pyramids have an influence

3464.16 --> 3470.24
perhaps because of frequencies

3467.2 --> 3474.3999999999996
it would be in the in the line of

3470.24 --> 3476.8799999999997
function function how do you say that

3474.4 --> 3480.4
effect where like yeah the shapes how

3476.88 --> 3480.4
it's arranged it matters

3481.28 --> 3486.8390000000004
but is that sound based maybe because of

3484.72 --> 3492.0
how the sound will typically

3486.839 --> 3493.52
flow and deflect off the objects

3492.0 --> 3496.88
and what type of effects come out of

3493.52 --> 3496.88
that might be an influence

3500.0 --> 3506.4
or yeah different like spirit

3503.44 --> 3507.599
what is the spirit energy actually what

3506.4 --> 3510.079
what are the

3507.599 --> 3512.0
influences directly of the environment

3510.079 --> 3513.8390000000004
on the spirit like that maybe

3512.0 --> 3517.839
yeah maybe it's even different from

3513.839 --> 3517.839
sound or light

3518.24 --> 3522.72
it's depicted in heroes dude

3523.839 --> 3530.0
what you mean a hieroglyph where you see

3528.64 --> 3535.2799999999997
a pyramid and then a light

3530.0 --> 3535.28
above it how is that supposed to

3535.68 --> 3539.52
prove what you said earlier andrew sorry

3538.16 --> 3545.839
i'm being a little

3539.52 --> 3545.839
tough on you but it's just

3556.839 --> 3564.799
yeah frequency of 33 hertz

3561.04 --> 3568.48
it's called inside great pyramid

3564.799 --> 3572.64
well george sanford i don't know

3568.48 --> 3575.839
could be i remember something from the

3572.64 --> 3578.96
pyramid code but there's more

3575.839 --> 3582.319
because like the way the

3578.96 --> 3585.52
stones and the types of stones

3582.319 --> 3587.599
are arranged inside of it

3585.52 --> 3589.28
there is all kinds of influences

3587.599 --> 3591.599
electrical

3589.28 --> 3592.3190000000004
and sound based like there are like

3591.599 --> 3595.44
specific

3592.319 --> 3601.839
sound chambers

3595.44 --> 3601.839
thinking like even inside the pyramid

3602.799 --> 3615.839
but i still don't see how that

3604.4 --> 3615.839
correlates anything to the stars though

3626.72 --> 3633.9199999999996
it's hard to explain in on here yeah

3630.0 --> 3636.48
i get that but i think that's also

3633.92 --> 3636.48
because

3636.799 --> 3642.48
you're feeling something in this idea

3639.839 --> 3643.839
but you're overlooking that it's not

3642.48 --> 3645.76
really

3643.839 --> 3647.92
connecting all that well there's a whole

3645.76 --> 3649.3590000000004
lot a lot of suspense of disbelief in

3647.92 --> 3652.4
the process you'll have to

3649.359 --> 3655.44
take in as well in order for it

3652.4 --> 3657.76
it to seem like it could work

3655.44 --> 3659.119
right i'm just trying to keep it real

3657.76 --> 3661.6800000000003
here

3659.119 --> 3662.4
because i've had heard those things as

3661.68 --> 3665.7599999999998
well and

3662.4 --> 3668.48
and yeah it fascinated me but i've just

3665.76 --> 3670.1600000000003
i guess i've been trained by the flat

3668.48 --> 3672.72
earth debate

3670.16 --> 3674.8799999999997
to kind of like not go with such

3672.72 --> 3677.5989999999997
fantastical ideas unless i can

3674.88 --> 3680.319
literally pin it down like how it could

3677.599 --> 3680.319
roughly work

3680.559 --> 3686.88
as soon as things are said like oh

3684.4 --> 3688.7200000000003
frequency of stars and the building of

3686.88 --> 3690.559
things in relation to the frequency of

3688.72 --> 3691.2799999999997
the stars that just seems a whole bunch

3690.559 --> 3699.8390000000004
of leaps

3691.28 --> 3699.8390000000004
that i can't really bridge

3707.59 --> 3710.7290000000003
[Music]

3710.839 --> 3713.839
hmm

3718.88 --> 3723.2000000000003
maybe they were trying to build heaven

3720.64 --> 3724.96
on earth well i have my own theory as to

3723.2 --> 3728.0
what pyramids were built for

3724.96 --> 3732.4
i think that they were hydroelectric

3728.0 --> 3734.16
electric field generators

3732.4 --> 3736.2400000000002
that were probably part of the

3734.16 --> 3741.839
technology and perhaps also

3736.24 --> 3741.839
feeding the giants with mana

3769.76 --> 3777.039
yes iron fe exactly

3773.52 --> 3779.0389999999998
it's not just piezoelectric stone

3777.039 --> 3780.96
there were also underneath the great

3779.039 --> 3786.079
pyramidal giza

3780.96 --> 3789.119
there's literally tunnels like in a in a

3786.079 --> 3793.28
almost like veins

3789.119 --> 3794.559
underneath meant for fluid to go through

3793.28 --> 3797.28
so

3794.559 --> 3801.039
probably there was water running through

3797.28 --> 3802.96
that when the nile was closer to it

3801.039 --> 3804.7990000000004
and that would have sparked running

3802.96 --> 3806.7200000000003
water sparks electricity

3804.799 --> 3809.2
that would be absorbed by the stone

3806.72 --> 3812.48
specifically designed for that

3809.2 --> 3815.2799999999997
which would be the powering source for

3812.48 --> 3818.319
the electric field generator that

3815.28 --> 3819.3590000000004
yeah the great pyramid very likely was

3818.319 --> 3821.92
and it would have had an

3819.359 --> 3822.4
influence when it was just completely

3821.92 --> 3825.76
fit

3822.4 --> 3828.799
yeah complete and not disassembled

3825.76 --> 3829.8390000000004
with the capstone and all the sidestone

3828.799 --> 3832.88
the pyramid would have been

3829.839 --> 3832.88
perfectly smooth

3833.039 --> 3836.4
and all the types of stone that are part

3834.88 --> 3839.039
of it all everything and the

3836.4 --> 3839.92
in the cap which probably was gold or

3839.039 --> 3842.2400000000002
something

3839.92 --> 3843.76
yeah it would have generated just this

3842.24 --> 3846.799
field of energy that would have

3843.76 --> 3851.6800000000003
positively influenced like all life

3846.799 --> 3855.7599999999998
like all plants and perhaps

3851.68 --> 3859.44
yeah even more dramatic with giants

3855.76 --> 3862.48
because i theorize that the giants

3859.44 --> 3864.4
were basically too big for their own

3862.48 --> 3866.319
metabolism

3864.4 --> 3868.64
like they would have engorged themselves

3866.319 --> 3870.48
constantly just to survive

3868.64 --> 3873.2799999999997
and that would have made them like

3870.48 --> 3875.44
hostile towards other life

3873.28 --> 3876.88
eventually and that's why they needed

3875.44 --> 3881.52
another source of food

3876.88 --> 3883.92
which could be electric

3881.52 --> 3885.7599999999998
right and then the great flood happened

3883.92 --> 3888.64
all the pyramids got covered

3885.76 --> 3891.119
it didn't work anymore the energy from

3888.64 --> 3893.44
them stopped and then the giants

3891.119 --> 3894.6400000000003
turned into hungry monsters and starting

3893.44 --> 3896.559
eating everything

3894.64 --> 3898.72
and then they got killed like the big

3896.559 --> 3901.6800000000003
ones

3898.72 --> 3902.72
and only the lesser big ones survived

3901.68 --> 3906.24
and then inbred with

3902.72 --> 3909.839
humanity and that's yeah the new era

3906.24 --> 3909.839
then it happened preceded

3910.0 --> 3913.2
it's part of my theory

3921.119 --> 3928.799
hi clutch bear power stations indeed

3926.16 --> 3929.68
right and it's it's not even really my

3928.799 --> 3932.88
theory

3929.68 --> 3937.839
i got it from the pyramid code

3932.88 --> 3937.839
a a mini series documentary that

3938.4 --> 3945.119
came out in the early 2000s

3941.839 --> 3945.119
and it really impressed me

3945.76 --> 3951.8390000000004
like it really impressed me and this was

3948.24 --> 3951.839
way before flat earth and all that

3957.76 --> 3965.8390000000004
hey multis good to see you

3969.02 --> 3972.099
[Music]

3973.52 --> 3978.24
all right but yeah effectively iron fe

3977.039 --> 3980.88
the great pyramid

3978.24 --> 3983.1189999999997
and how i presume it was an electric

3980.88 --> 3985.44
generator so i'm a field generator

3983.119 --> 3988.4
it's very close to even like how

3985.44 --> 3988.4
organized works

3989.28 --> 3994.48
right it would have been like electro

3992.52 --> 3999.44
hydroelectrically enforced

3994.48 --> 3999.44
organized generator very much like that

4004.839 --> 4007.839
massive

4018.839 --> 4021.839
mm-hmm

4025.52 --> 4030.72
i know right iron fe well that's that's

4028.72 --> 4032.72
why i'm very proud that i was able to

4030.72 --> 4034.5589999999997
bring that forward that theory of the

4032.72 --> 4036.319
giants putting the giants in there

4034.559 --> 4037.6800000000003
putting atlantis in there putting the

4036.319 --> 4041.2
flood in there

4037.68 --> 4044.0
and really making it clear

4041.2 --> 4044.64
what the pyramids were built for right

4044.0 --> 4047.119
because

4044.64 --> 4048.4
you're not gonna build like this insane

4047.119 --> 4050.88
giant tomb

4048.4 --> 4054.079
for somebody that's ridiculous now why

4050.88 --> 4056.1600000000003
do really big things get built

4054.079 --> 4059.2000000000003
because they serve a function because

4056.16 --> 4062.48
it's worth building it that big

4059.2 --> 4064.0
right nobody builds [ __ ] just for

4062.48 --> 4065.839
giggles

4064.0 --> 4067.28
when it's that big it has to have a

4065.839 --> 4070.319
function right

4067.28 --> 4073.44
well a power generator would be

4070.319 --> 4076.88
a very good function for a

4073.44 --> 4079.92
huge device would be a good enough

4076.88 --> 4079.92
reason to build that

4080.799 --> 4083.92
right you're not going to build a

4082.96 --> 4087.2
insanely

4083.92 --> 4087.839
large ornament it's not going to be an

4087.2 --> 4089.5989999999997
ornament

4087.839 --> 4091.52
it has to have some technological

4089.599 --> 4094.0
function or it makes no damn sense that

4091.52 --> 4104.56
they built it

4094.0 --> 4119.839
it would have have to be worth it

4104.56 --> 4119.839000000001
yep moth eyes indeed

4125.199 --> 4129.04
right and hey if you had if they had

4127.92 --> 4132.4800000000005
that technology

4129.04 --> 4135.2789999999995
pyramids causing energy

4132.48 --> 4136.718999999999
allowing giants to grow bigger and less

4135.279 --> 4139.1990000000005
hungry what a blessing

4136.719 --> 4140.4800000000005
the giants before that was figured out

4139.199 --> 4144.5599999999995
giants were just

4140.48 --> 4144.5599999999995
hungry brutes perhaps

4145.12 --> 4149.12
unless that energy that pyramids would

4147.04 --> 4151.2789999999995
have later created was there

4149.12 --> 4153.44
originally in another fashion and then

4151.279 --> 4154.64
perhaps it was destroyed maybe the giant

4153.44 --> 4157.759
trees or whatever

4154.64 --> 4160.400000000001
wonders were out there pre-atlantean

4157.759 --> 4163.6
aged in the age of wonders

4160.4 --> 4166.799
but yeah if giants would have been

4163.6 --> 4169.839
titanic sized like

4166.799 --> 4171.6
the impact if it's just external food

4169.839 --> 4174.64
would be too dramatic they would still

4171.6 --> 4177.679
be crushed under their own weight

4174.64 --> 4180.400000000001
so they would have have to had survived

4177.679 --> 4181.679
somehow well the only way that i could

4180.4 --> 4185.679
think of is like

4181.679 --> 4185.679
yeah electrically

4185.759 --> 4192.159
and yeah if you have

4188.799 --> 4192.88
really large giants how easy would that

4192.159 --> 4195.839999999999
make

4192.88 --> 4196.32
for things like transport if you're

4195.84 --> 4199.76
gonna

4196.32 --> 4203.28
have a giant amount of materials well

4199.76 --> 4206.320000000001
yeah have giants they could just

4203.28 --> 4207.5199999999995
pick up like a what is it a 10 ton piece

4206.32 --> 4210.799999999999
of stone

4207.52 --> 4211.76
and just carry it you don't need like a

4210.8 --> 4213.92
thousand people

4211.76 --> 4216.0
and no people dying in accidents and

4213.92 --> 4217.36
[ __ ] and getting stuck in it taking a

4216.0 --> 4219.28
year or more

4217.36 --> 4221.759999999999
no you just have a couple of giants they

4219.28 --> 4225.12
just pick it up

4221.76 --> 4226.159000000001
yeah so much efficient so much efficient

4225.12 --> 4229.04
efficiency

4226.159 --> 4232.08
right but it would have been like well

4229.04 --> 4234.159
the pyramid scheme for giants

4232.08 --> 4235.36
because the giants would need the

4234.159 --> 4237.599999999999
pyramids

4235.36 --> 4238.719
in order to become that big then

4237.6 --> 4243.360000000001
becoming that big

4238.719 --> 4246.32
would allow them to build more pyramids

4243.36 --> 4249.92
to stay like that and to stay fed to not

4246.32 --> 4252.159
get drained and super hungry

4249.92 --> 4253.1990000000005
so it would have been the first pyramid

4252.159 --> 4255.839999999999
scheme

4253.199 --> 4255.839999999999
literally

4256.88 --> 4261.36
and that would be also very logical as

4259.199 --> 4262.0
to why there are so many pyramids around

4261.36 --> 4272.159
the world

4262.0 --> 4276.159
in all kinds of locations

4272.159 --> 4278.159
or giant doors are a giveaway well

4276.159 --> 4279.5199999999995
those giant doors would have been for

4278.159 --> 4282.879999999999
the

4279.52 --> 4283.280000000001
not oversized giants yet they they're

4282.88 --> 4286.400000000001
still

4283.28 --> 4289.44
giant doors for like two

4286.4 --> 4292.159
three times size of a normal human

4289.44 --> 4293.04
right but the giants that i'm talking

4292.159 --> 4296.639999999999
about would have been

4293.04 --> 4300.4
colossal say 20

4296.64 --> 4303.6
30 meters high maybe more

4300.4 --> 4304.48
colossal right they won't fit through

4303.6 --> 4306.320000000001
those doors but

4304.48 --> 4308.4
they were never meant to fit through any

4306.32 --> 4310.32
door right they become that big

4308.4 --> 4312.32
you reconcile yeah you're not gonna get

4310.32 --> 4313.36
in any kind of building or cave ever

4312.32 --> 4315.04
again

4313.36 --> 4329.839999999999
you're always going to be outside if

4315.04 --> 4329.84
you're that big

4331.36 --> 4334.4
right tom parker and it's even testified

4333.84 --> 4337.6
to

4334.4 --> 4341.36
in the bible how freaking insanely

4337.6 --> 4343.52
large some of these giants were right

4341.36 --> 4344.639999999999
they always stuck to me like no no

4343.52 --> 4346.56
they're not just two

4344.64 --> 4347.76
three times as big no they're like

4346.56 --> 4351.120000000001
really freaking

4347.76 --> 4351.679
insanely large so yeah how did they

4351.12 --> 4353.44
survive

4351.679 --> 4354.88
they must have been able to survive

4353.44 --> 4356.799999999999
somehow

4354.88 --> 4359.04
like they're not just gonna grow that

4356.8 --> 4361.679
large in a year time

4359.04 --> 4363.44
and then yeah drop dead because of

4361.679 --> 4364.2390000000005
malnutrition and breaking under their

4363.44 --> 4366.799999999999
own weight

4364.239 --> 4367.678999999999
they would have to had grown at a very

4366.8 --> 4370.320000000001
prolonged

4367.679 --> 4370.88
time and survive in all that time have

4370.32 --> 4374.239
to have

4370.88 --> 4377.4400000000005
the nutrition and be able to

4374.239 --> 4380.239
not ravage everybody in order to

4377.44 --> 4382.32
make everybody turn against them for a

4380.239 --> 4384.639999999999
very long time

4382.32 --> 4386.32
right if they were always just hungry

4384.64 --> 4389.84
and just snatching

4386.32 --> 4392.239
food and people and yeah

4389.84 --> 4394.4800000000005
how long can you live like that not very

4392.239 --> 4395.919999999999
long everybody's gonna hate you and hunt

4394.48 --> 4399.5199999999995
you

4395.92 --> 4401.84
and band together to get you down right

4399.52 --> 4404.4800000000005
so they must have been able to survive

4401.84 --> 4407.28
for a very long time

4404.48 --> 4409.599999999999
and not be consumed by their own hunger

4407.28 --> 4412.719
and crushed under their their own weight

4409.6 --> 4414.0
somehow so to me the only way that could

4412.719 --> 4416.96
have happened

4414.0 --> 4418.56
that i can envision is that that there

4416.96 --> 4419.28
would have been devices that would

4418.56 --> 4423.76
provide

4419.28 --> 4423.759999999999
that nourishment and in this case the

4424.84 --> 4427.84
pyramids

4436.4 --> 4439.5199999999995
how many were there

4439.76 --> 4443.84
well how many pyramids are there right

4442.4 --> 4445.839999999999
there would have always been a direct

4443.84 --> 4448.08
correlation with uh

4445.84 --> 4449.04
with how many giants or how big the

4448.08 --> 4452.84
total

4449.04 --> 4456.239
amount of giant length and

4452.84 --> 4458.64
pyramids and probably

4456.239 --> 4462.4
two that the bigger they got the closer

4458.64 --> 4462.400000000001
they needed to be to the pyramids

4464.159 --> 4468.0
right because when the giants were still

4466.88 --> 4470.2390000000005
because i think giants

4468.0 --> 4471.52
like they don't get born that big they

4470.239 --> 4474.799999999999
start out

4471.52 --> 4477.679
human size and then they keep growing

4474.8 --> 4477.679
and they don't stop

4479.52 --> 4486.719
so in the beginning they would not have

4482.56 --> 4488.96
the burden of requiring that

4486.719 --> 4490.4800000000005
electricity as much because they're not

4488.96 --> 4493.92
that large they can still

4490.48 --> 4496.959999999999
just survive like a normal human being

4493.92 --> 4498.8
with that diet and then as they grow

4496.96 --> 4499.679
bigger it becomes more difficult and

4498.8 --> 4501.679
then they really

4499.679 --> 4503.52
eventually get reached that point where

4501.679 --> 4505.6
they need to be in the presence of a

4503.52 --> 4507.280000000001
pyramid or they'll grow really hungry

4505.6 --> 4508.84
and if they stay way too long then

4507.28 --> 4511.84
they'll

4508.84 --> 4511.84
collapse

4515.36 --> 4525.839999999999
hey unbelievable productions good to see

4517.92 --> 4525.84
you in chat

4536.84 --> 4539.84
do

4543.04 --> 4548.56
they were covered in stone until they

4545.52 --> 4551.4400000000005
could no longer move

4548.56 --> 4552.2390000000005
that's interesting well who knows iron

4551.44 --> 4554.32
fe

4552.239 --> 4556.4
like yeah if you're gonna be a big giant

4554.32 --> 4557.759999999999
and you're also gonna be utilized for

4556.4 --> 4560.96
combat

4557.76 --> 4564.56
well then maybe they had giant

4560.96 --> 4568.159
armor built can you imagine like a piece

4564.56 --> 4572.8
of armor plating like a breastplate

4568.159 --> 4574.96
that is 10 meters high

4572.8 --> 4574.96
just

4576.159 --> 4583.199
like a building sized

4579.199 --> 4584.5599999999995
plate armor yeah

4583.199 --> 4586.719
and that armor could have been

4584.56 --> 4589.120000000001
incredibly thick like a tank

4586.719 --> 4590.159
like nothing could come through that

4589.12 --> 4592.4
right

4590.159 --> 4593.5199999999995
or it could have been made from rock

4592.4 --> 4596.96
right if they can

4593.52 --> 4599.92
mold rock then you can mold rock armor

4596.96 --> 4600.64
funny thing is i even incorporated that

4599.92 --> 4604.0
effect

4600.64 --> 4605.92
in d d there is spells in dungeons and

4604.0 --> 4608.48
dragons that can literally make you mold

4605.92 --> 4609.5
stone like literally it's not even that

4608.48 --> 4612.5599999999995
high level

4609.5 --> 4612.56
[Music]

4613.199 --> 4616.639999999999
and so i've made a standard option like

4615.52 --> 4619.120000000001
yeah you can make

4616.64 --> 4620.400000000001
armor off certain types of stone carry

4619.12 --> 4623.76
its hardness they will be

4620.4 --> 4626.239
very heavy so your character has to be

4623.76 --> 4626.88
super strong really to be able to be

4626.239 --> 4637.839999999999
able to

4626.88 --> 4637.84
have stone armor

4639.92 --> 4644.4
bigger trees see giant broccoli that's

4642.4 --> 4646.799999999999
that's that's really funny idea good

4644.4 --> 4646.799999999999
servant

4650.0 --> 4655.92
giant broccoli well who knows man if it

4654.239 --> 4658.08
if the giants

4655.92 --> 4659.4400000000005
could have grown that big then perhaps a

4658.08 --> 4661.44
lot of plants could have

4659.44 --> 4662.799999999999
even crops could have grown that big as

4661.44 --> 4665.28
well

4662.8 --> 4667.52
right maybe they did have like giant

4665.28 --> 4670.159
broccoli trees that would grow up to 20

4667.52 --> 4670.159000000001
meters tall

4670.96 --> 4682.0
who knows

4679.84 --> 4682.88
ah hello aaron brown yeah i love this

4682.0 --> 4693.84
topic as well

4682.88 --> 4693.84
it's great

4698.239 --> 4701.28
big ass carrot well carrots are going to

4700.0 --> 4704.719
be more well

4701.28 --> 4707.759999999999
still possible all right carrots are

4704.719 --> 4711.199
like a root roots

4707.76 --> 4714.159000000001
so yeah big ass carrots means digging

4711.199 --> 4716.4
deep like really freaking deep like

4714.159 --> 4718.32
having a carrot a giant carrot growing

4716.4 --> 4719.44
somewhere is going to literally over

4718.32 --> 4722.639999999999
time just

4719.44 --> 4724.96
displace the land it's gonna

4722.64 --> 4727.12
it's gonna be pretty tough to dig that

4724.96 --> 4727.12
out

4728.56 --> 4732.320000000001
but of course any plant any type of crop

4731.04 --> 4734.239
always has roots

4732.32 --> 4736.0
right but if you're going to if that's

4734.239 --> 4737.678999999999
going to be the food part

4736.0 --> 4740.32
then if it's really giant it's going to

4737.679 --> 4742.64
be a giant hassle to dig that out

4740.32 --> 4743.759999999999
and it's going to basically pressure

4742.64 --> 4748.08
press against the

4743.76 --> 4750.08
land root vegetables pull it out

4748.08 --> 4752.159
well if it's strong enough for that good

4750.08 --> 4756.08
servant

4752.159 --> 4759.36
because if the substance is like

4756.08 --> 4761.199
as fragile as a carrot then trying to

4759.36 --> 4762.88
pull it out it would simply break off

4761.199 --> 4766.5599999999995
the top

4762.88 --> 4769.36
right because it's going to be stuck

4766.56 --> 4771.1990000000005
in that land that's been pressing so

4769.36 --> 4773.839999999999
it's going to be even more compacted

4771.199 --> 4776.0
it's going to be tough to pull that out

4773.84 --> 4777.76
i don't know why i'm being so incredibly

4776.0 --> 4781.6
pragmatic about this

4777.76 --> 4785.1990000000005
but i think that yeah just

4781.6 --> 4785.1990000000005
whatever giant vegetables

4785.679 --> 4790.159
i'm not too sure there were even giant

4787.36 --> 4794.239
vegetables right and would they need it

4790.159 --> 4796.48
if yeah the giants could simply

4794.239 --> 4797.839999999999
feed off the mana energy from the

4796.48 --> 4800.0
pyramids

4797.84 --> 4802.2390000000005
but then again maybe they did have just

4800.0 --> 4805.199
giant gardens

4802.239 --> 4807.04
at pyramid sites like a little further

4805.199 --> 4810.4
away so that it wouldn't

4807.04 --> 4812.4
damage the structure itself

4810.4 --> 4813.679
but yeah maybe they did have giant

4812.4 --> 4815.679
gardens

4813.679 --> 4817.1990000000005
and that they fed of that and that they

4815.679 --> 4818.96
needed the pyramids to grow the

4817.199 --> 4821.919999999999
vegetables instead

4818.96 --> 4825.36
i don't know it just could go in all

4821.92 --> 4825.36
kinds of directions like that

4830.719 --> 4836.4
i'm now trying to imagine that like

4833.28 --> 4840.239
archaeologists would be baffled

4836.4 --> 4844.0
because they found a giant petrified

4840.239 --> 4845.12
carrot like a carrot like of 30 meters

4844.0 --> 4846.719
long or something

4845.12 --> 4848.8
petrified and they could really like

4846.719 --> 4850.08
whoa yeah this is really a carrot when

4848.8 --> 4853.04
we

4850.08 --> 4853.92
cut into it and split it into you could

4853.04 --> 4856.639
really see

4853.92 --> 4858.159
the structure of the growth giant

4856.639 --> 4860.56
carrots people

4858.159 --> 4862.799999999999
a giant petrified carrot of 20 meters

4860.56 --> 4862.8
long

4863.6 --> 4868.88
i guess some of that would have to be

4867.199 --> 4875.839999999999
found at some point

4868.88 --> 4875.84
i hope that would be kind of cool

4880.719 --> 4884.159
yes oh yes moth eyes i've seen a lot of

4883.44 --> 4886.839999999999
it

4884.159 --> 4888.159
rock formations that look like giant

4886.84 --> 4891.92
animals

4888.159 --> 4891.92
or yeah humanoids

4892.88 --> 4899.92
it is certainly worth considering

4896.88 --> 4903.52
on the other hand though it's very

4899.92 --> 4906.08
difficult because

4903.52 --> 4906.639
how can you be absolutely certain that

4906.08 --> 4909.44
those are

4906.639 --> 4911.679
actually creatures and not like

4909.44 --> 4914.719
sculptures

4911.679 --> 4915.1990000000005
in honor of those creatures after they

4914.719 --> 4918.8
were

4915.199 --> 4922.08
killed like we missed the giants

4918.8 --> 4924.400000000001
i'm gonna make a statue out of it

4922.08 --> 4927.44
so that it can still feel like the good

4924.4 --> 4930.799999999999
old giants are still with us

4927.44 --> 4932.879999999999
right you know how do you know

4930.8 --> 4934.8
right unless you actually go into those

4932.88 --> 4936.719
stone formations and start like

4934.8 --> 4938.08
digging into it cutting into it and then

4936.719 --> 4941.199
noticing like whoa

4938.08 --> 4943.28
the way this part here is petrified yeah

4941.199 --> 4944.879999999999
it totally proved that this was kind of

4943.28 --> 4947.759999999999
like a ligament

4944.88 --> 4950.88
and a piece of bone and that you could

4947.76 --> 4950.88
literally see the

4952.0 --> 4958.159
the autonomy of the creature in the

4955.6 --> 4960.2390000000005
in the petrified rock formation right

4958.159 --> 4962.879999999999
then i'd say like okay yeah

4960.239 --> 4964.879999999999
that's if you spot all that then maybe

4962.88 --> 4968.96
it was a petrified giant

4964.88 --> 4971.04
or something but that doesn't exclude

4968.96 --> 4972.08
the possibility from just a whole bunch

4971.04 --> 4974.56
of people

4972.08 --> 4976.32
making giant sculptures out of local

4974.56 --> 4977.679
rock formations because they kind of

4976.32 --> 4980.0
missed the giants

4977.679 --> 4981.36
right i'm not even convinced that all

4980.0 --> 4983.679
the giants were evil

4981.36 --> 4985.759999999999
right hey if they didn't eat people

4983.679 --> 4987.6
constantly because they didn't need to

4985.76 --> 4989.52
then they could turn out to be kind of

4987.6 --> 4992.159000000001
really nice and helpful

4989.52 --> 4993.280000000001
and protective against wild animals and

4992.159 --> 4995.599999999999
[ __ ]

4993.28 --> 4998.0
right so the whole bunch of people and

4995.6 --> 5000.56
tribes might actually

4998.0 --> 5001.52
have really appreciated the giant's

5000.56 --> 5004.8
presence

5001.52 --> 5006.719
some of them right because of course

5004.8 --> 5008.56
even the bible says there were a whole

5006.719 --> 5011.28
bunch of them that were probably very

5008.56 --> 5011.280000000001
evil as well

5011.6 --> 5015.84
kind of just like with mankind

5018.32 --> 5021.92
so that could be all kinds of things

5026.84 --> 5032.08
right

5029.28 --> 5033.04
but yes i've seen many many different

5032.08 --> 5035.36
pictures

5033.04 --> 5037.679
of stone formations that are just like a

5035.36 --> 5041.679
cup that's a freaking giant face

5037.679 --> 5044.88
or something or a hand or

5041.679 --> 5044.88
yeah lots of that

5046.639 --> 5050.400000000001
but yeah that could be several things

5048.8 --> 5053.12
that could even people

5050.4 --> 5053.44
dude that could be photoshop you don't

5053.12 --> 5056.88
know

5053.44 --> 5060.638999999999
until you actually like find motion

5056.88 --> 5065.4400000000005
video of it and it can also be

5060.639 --> 5068.4800000000005
just a really old sculpture

5065.44 --> 5070.719
to honor them but hey it could actually

5068.48 --> 5073.28
turn out to be a real petrified giant or

5070.719 --> 5077.44
something and you would figure it out by

5073.28 --> 5081.199
analyzing the petrified anatomy of it

5077.44 --> 5083.678999999999
to make sure so yeah don't

5081.199 --> 5084.638999999999
just automatically assume that every

5083.679 --> 5088.159
picture of

5084.639 --> 5091.4400000000005
some kind of suspicious giant

5088.159 --> 5093.199
a lot giant looking rock formation

5091.44 --> 5095.5199999999995
that it's always going to be a giant you

5093.199 --> 5099.839999999999
don't know for sure until you actually

5095.52 --> 5099.84
yeah figure out what is necessary

5104.0 --> 5108.48
yeah that's a very poor comparison tiny

5110.84 --> 5115.1
womble

5111.97 --> 5115.1
[Music]

5124.84 --> 5127.84
wow

5132.48 --> 5140.959999999999
my happy just a woman lying oh that's

5134.48 --> 5155.839999999999
fascinating moth eyes

5140.96 --> 5155.84
all right

5166.84 --> 5169.84
hmm

5180.84 --> 5183.84
uh

5195.92 --> 5202.32
hmm okay unbelievable productions where

5198.88 --> 5202.32
is that described exactly

5206.239 --> 5211.839999999999
oh you're gonna retype that

5217.28 --> 5220.8
having some keyboard issues

5222.96 --> 5226.96
oh with abraham's signing one ah

5229.84 --> 5233.029
[Music]

5236.159 --> 5239.36
yeah that's okay unbelievable

5237.52 --> 5242.159000000001
productions i

5239.36 --> 5243.679
appreciate your trying to put it down

5242.159 --> 5247.92
correctly

5243.679 --> 5247.92
i appreciate the effort uh

5248.639 --> 5253.84
but where did you read that exactly

5255.52 --> 5262.4800000000005
is that some side book from the bible

5260.239 --> 5263.5199999999995
is that the book of giants or something

5262.48 --> 5266.718999999999
is it from that

5263.52 --> 5267.52
i haven't actually read it but it does

5266.719 --> 5271.44
sound very

5267.52 --> 5274.159000000001
interesting what you're talking about

5271.44 --> 5275.12
like any wars where there's literally

5274.159 --> 5281.599999999999
giants in them

5275.12 --> 5284.719
are very fascinating

5281.6 --> 5284.719
it wasn't genesis

5285.44 --> 5287.678999999999
what

5289.28 --> 5298.48
the only thing i remember from the bible

5294.159 --> 5301.36
is where david went up against goliath

5298.48 --> 5302.5599999999995
right that's the only giant that i

5301.36 --> 5305.5199999999995
really remember

5302.56 --> 5309.84
significantly because like the sizes and

5305.52 --> 5309.84
all that mattered

5345.679 --> 5351.84
all right cool thanks

5362.8 --> 5366.2390000000005
yes moth eyes i know that

5366.88 --> 5371.04
book of enoch and the book of the giants

5371.76 --> 5376.0
like i know about the book of the giants

5373.6 --> 5378.56
through flat water

5376.0 --> 5379.12
he's talked about he has had some really

5378.56 --> 5393.84
good

5379.12 --> 5393.84
videos about that

5424.27 --> 5427.619000000001
[Music]

5432.84 --> 5435.84
hmm

5467.6 --> 5470.96
right aaron iffy well

5472.56 --> 5478.8
how about ballistics like giants

5475.6 --> 5480.88
can throw really big rocks

5478.8 --> 5491.84
right who needs a catapult when you got

5480.88 --> 5491.84
a giant

5494.159 --> 5497.599999999999
right and with a catapult you kind of

5496.08 --> 5500.719
have to use like oh

5497.6 --> 5501.1990000000005
the dynamics the path or the strength of

5500.719 --> 5503.44
the thing

5501.199 --> 5505.36
a giant can literally pick up a giant

5503.44 --> 5508.5599999999995
boulder like the big ones and then

5505.36 --> 5519.839999999999
freaking aim it like a ball

5508.56 --> 5519.84
just directly at the target like man

5524.48 --> 5530.32
also giants are going to be kind of

5527.92 --> 5531.6
kind of handy when it comes to like

5530.32 --> 5533.5199999999995
giant walls like

5531.6 --> 5537.04
what do you mean giant wall the giant

5533.52 --> 5546.8
can literally just step over it or just

5537.04 --> 5548.32
pull it apart right like oh they're all

5546.8 --> 5560.400000000001
bottled up in the fortress

5548.32 --> 5563.04
bang now there's a hole in the fortress

5560.4 --> 5564.96
story of goliath isn't lit what the [ __ ]

5563.04 --> 5574.239
are you talking about tiny wumbo

5564.96 --> 5576.4
how do you know were you there

5574.239 --> 5578.638999999999
feeding battle giants would be expensive

5576.4 --> 5578.638999999999
though

5580.48 --> 5582.718999999999
well

5585.44 --> 5588.719
i don't i i don't know what iron fe

5588.08 --> 5591.84
that's

5588.719 --> 5593.36
that kind of depends right because the

5591.84 --> 5595.4400000000005
amount of power they have

5593.36 --> 5598.48
in very short time like a giant really

5595.44 --> 5600.879999999999
big giants could totally turn the entire

5598.48 --> 5601.5199999999995
scenario around and like quickly

5600.88 --> 5603.92
relative

5601.52 --> 5605.76
to what if humans had to do it like

5603.92 --> 5610.08
quickly just destroy

5605.76 --> 5610.08
something a fortress or whatever

5610.239 --> 5614.32
so to feed them would be actually kind

5612.639 --> 5615.52
of cheap compared to what they could

5614.32 --> 5617.92
accomplish

5615.52 --> 5619.679
it's rather that yeah keeping them

5617.92 --> 5623.28
around

5619.679 --> 5625.6
not for battle would be more expensive

5623.28 --> 5627.28
if they would indeed be consuming a lot

5625.6 --> 5629.120000000001
if they wouldn't be able to if you

5627.28 --> 5631.199
wouldn't be able to feed them by like a

5629.12 --> 5632.96
pyramid at close proximity

5631.199 --> 5636.719
something like that yeah then it would

5632.96 --> 5639.199
be expensive to keep them around

5636.719 --> 5644.56
but to actually utilize them in battle

5639.199 --> 5659.839999999999
would be an enormous advantage

5644.56 --> 5659.84
literally enormous advantage

5674.08 --> 5677.679
did they use money back then

5678.32 --> 5683.199
yeah why not why wouldn't they

5684.0 --> 5690.159
but it would be more based on services

5687.199 --> 5690.719
just like loyalty and all that would

5690.159 --> 5693.839999999999
have been

5690.719 --> 5693.84
much more important

5694.32 --> 5701.84
right because money is just a mechanism

5698.96 --> 5704.4
to make trade a little bit more easy but

5701.84 --> 5714.08
if there's no trust

5704.4 --> 5716.08
then yeah what good is it

5714.08 --> 5717.119
so as long as the money would be

5716.08 --> 5720.48
guaranteed to

5717.119 --> 5722.88
represent something that would be more

5720.48 --> 5724.4
important

5722.88 --> 5726.4800000000005
like whatever they used like even if

5724.4 --> 5727.759999999999
they used seashells or something right

5726.48 --> 5730.08
as long as it actually

5727.76 --> 5732.0
represents something and nobody tries to

5730.08 --> 5735.199
grapple the situation by collecting all

5732.0 --> 5737.36
the seashells in the world

5735.199 --> 5739.36
well if somebody did that then everybody

5737.36 --> 5742.32
would just say yeah [ __ ] off

5739.36 --> 5757.839999999999
you're trying to break our trade system

5742.32 --> 5757.84
and get the hell out of here

5765.04 --> 5773.76
into slime pits

5768.719 --> 5773.76
slime pits what the ew

5774.159 --> 5778.159
body's being preserved well that depends

5776.159 --> 5779.92
on the nature of the slime like if it's

5778.159 --> 5785.839999999999
acidic

5779.92 --> 5785.84
yuck what a way to go

5794.159 --> 5799.119
i think that especially because of the

5796.88 --> 5801.6
time span and everything that's happened

5799.119 --> 5803.5199999999995
including the flood it's very unlikely

5801.6 --> 5806.320000000001
you're gonna find

5803.52 --> 5809.040000000001
like an intact giant somewhere although

5806.32 --> 5812.4
dude maybe

5809.04 --> 5814.48
freaking antarctica somewhere you know

5812.4 --> 5818.32
could be could be that there's like

5814.48 --> 5818.32
freaking frozen giants in there

5821.59 --> 5827.679
[Music]

5824.239 --> 5829.5199999999995
but if it's not like in a very prolonged

5827.679 --> 5832.0
deep freeze of some kind yeah

5829.52 --> 5841.84
how there's very unlikely that it's not

5832.0 --> 5841.84
gonna be petrified or just withered away

5842.4 --> 5848.638999999999
quicksand what is that iron fp what

5845.92 --> 5848.639
quicksand

5849.04 --> 5854.32
do you even know what quicksand is

5852.639 --> 5856.400000000001
you think that there's going to be

5854.32 --> 5860.5599999999995
quicksand that could actually

5856.4 --> 5864.0
sink an entire giant really

5860.56 --> 5864.0
well that's got to be like

5864.08 --> 5868.8
no no quicksand is never going to be

5866.8 --> 5870.4800000000005
that big that it could actually sink an

5868.8 --> 5872.639
entire giant now that's

5870.48 --> 5872.638999999999
no

5873.679 --> 5877.119
tar pits maybe

5877.28 --> 5880.96
i don't know i don't think they get that

5879.44 --> 5885.199
big either

5880.96 --> 5887.52
you know like if it if a giant

5885.199 --> 5888.48
would go down in a tarpon it would have

5887.52 --> 5891.76
really had to be

5888.48 --> 5894.08
like they would slip and dive in

5891.76 --> 5895.280000000001
face first get knocked out and then

5894.08 --> 5898.159
literally just

5895.28 --> 5899.84
sink into it because tar pits aren't

5898.159 --> 5902.239
really that deep

5899.84 --> 5903.4400000000005
so they would have to fall in and then

5902.239 --> 5906.799999999999
yeah basically

5903.44 --> 5911.199
drown in the tar face down

5906.8 --> 5914.08
and then maybe

5911.199 --> 5915.04
yes i know i rent a fee but i think that

5914.08 --> 5917.679
like

5915.04 --> 5920.88
a quicksand liquefied sand as you say i

5917.679 --> 5924.639
think that a lot of that is a myth

5920.88 --> 5930.08
i think it's very rare and it's not

5924.639 --> 5930.08
big quick sand locations are not big

5934.96 --> 5938.4800000000005
right because if it becomes too big it

5937.52 --> 5952.159000000001
just becomes

5938.48 --> 5954.5599999999995
swamp it's more like a swamp

5952.159 --> 5955.839999999999
uh we're talking about giants right so

5954.56 --> 5959.280000000001
yeah a person

5955.84 --> 5960.96
who knows get unlucky enough

5959.28 --> 5962.96
like it's more likely to be hit by

5960.96 --> 5964.4800000000005
lightning than to actually drown in

5962.96 --> 5967.84
quicksand okay

5964.48 --> 5967.839999999999
okay think about it

5968.32 --> 5972.159
but yeah a human could potentially sink

5970.8 --> 5975.679
into it and then like

5972.159 --> 5978.0
yeah it would be two meters three meters

5975.679 --> 5981.04
deep and then they would be [ __ ]

5978.0 --> 5983.119
how are you gonna get a giant 20 meters

5981.04 --> 5986.4
tall

5983.119 --> 5988.719
to get to die from quicksand

5986.4 --> 5990.239
right they might get their foot stuck or

5988.719 --> 5992.84
something

5990.239 --> 5994.32
but yeah unless you're gonna sink in

5992.84 --> 5998.0
completely

5994.32 --> 6002.639
yeah you will be able to get out so

5998.0 --> 6005.52
no no giant has ever died from quicksand

6002.639 --> 6007.84
i can guarantee you that unless they

6005.52 --> 6009.92
were like a half giant and not that big

6007.84 --> 6013.4400000000005
like two meters to three meters

6009.92 --> 6017.119
maybe but a real giant from old no

6013.44 --> 6023.839999999999
no way i guarantee it's not

6017.119 --> 6023.839999999999
is not happening

6034.84 --> 6037.84
so

6048.84 --> 6051.84
wow

6054.0 --> 6059.04
how tall do i think the tallest giants

6056.8 --> 6059.04
were

6060.239 --> 6065.839999999999
so what era

6067.04 --> 6073.28
right i the way it's divided over time

6071.04 --> 6075.28
roughly i think with the giants is that

6073.28 --> 6077.44
post flop there were still some giants

6075.28 --> 6080.4
but they weren't really big so

6077.44 --> 6080.4
probably wouldn't have been

6080.56 --> 6085.84
bigger than three meters perhaps

6083.76 --> 6087.6
because the bigger couldn't survive and

6085.84 --> 6089.119000000001
the smaller ones that would grow that

6087.6 --> 6091.280000000001
big eventually would also

6089.119 --> 6094.48
just start starving going mad being

6091.28 --> 6098.719
executed by the locals

6094.48 --> 6102.718999999999
but atlantean age yeah 20 meters

6098.719 --> 6106.2390000000005
surely maybe 30 and then you got

6102.719 --> 6108.08
like even pre-atlantean era who knows

6106.239 --> 6109.678999999999
how big things could have been and

6108.08 --> 6113.679
wouldn't even in my

6109.679 --> 6116.32
field have to be necessarily human

6113.679 --> 6117.28
humanoid giants all of it could be all

6116.32 --> 6120.5599999999995
kinds of just

6117.28 --> 6123.04
colossal insane colossal titanic-sized

6120.56 --> 6123.04
creatures

6123.44 --> 6130.96
like godzilla sized

6127.28 --> 6133.199
[ __ ] real titans that's all

6130.96 --> 6135.119
ajo wonders that's where just everything

6133.199 --> 6138.32
was just

6135.119 --> 6140.0
just totally unlimited like out of

6138.32 --> 6142.719
control

6140.0 --> 6143.679
super vast creatures giant dragons giant

6142.719 --> 6146.719
humanoids

6143.679 --> 6152.4800000000005
whatever giant trees

6146.719 --> 6152.4800000000005
giant mushrooms all kinds of things

6152.719 --> 6155.92
age of wonders right

6157.119 --> 6163.839999999999
what couldn't have been possible in the

6158.8 --> 6163.84
age of oneness

6183.76 --> 6186.08
what

6187.28 --> 6191.759999999999
mortar slime pits were used in the

6190.08 --> 6196.5599999999995
construction of babel

6191.76 --> 6198.719
how what how

6196.56 --> 6200.8
i don't understand unbelievable

6198.719 --> 6205.84
productions i'm fascinated though but i

6200.8 --> 6205.84
don't understand

6209.28 --> 6213.84
monsters in the newer godzilla movies

6210.96 --> 6213.84
are called titans

6215.679 --> 6221.76
yeah why not right titan is kind of like

6219.44 --> 6223.919999999999
a size based designation so yeah if

6221.76 --> 6232.320000000001
you're that freaking large yeah you are

6223.92 --> 6235.04
effectively a titan

6232.32 --> 6237.44
do you think some of the very large yard

6235.04 --> 6240.56
giants were able to travel to antarctica

6237.44 --> 6240.5599999999995
and beyond the ice wall

6244.84 --> 6249.1990000000005
no

6246.32 --> 6249.759999999999
are there any pyramids on antarctica

6249.199 --> 6253.599999999999
then

6249.76 --> 6256.639
no if it was always an ice scape

6253.6 --> 6259.6
and they could not be fed

6256.639 --> 6261.36
by pyramid energy then how could they

6259.6 --> 6263.1990000000005
have ever

6261.36 --> 6265.679
went across that they would have also

6263.199 --> 6268.32
just frozen to death and [ __ ]

6265.679 --> 6271.119
and what what would they be looking for

6268.32 --> 6271.119
out there even

6271.76 --> 6275.76
right the only way that could have

6273.44 --> 6279.839999999999
happened if at some point

6275.76 --> 6282.159000000001
the antarctica region the ice wall

6279.84 --> 6285.76
wasn't ice then perhaps they could have

6282.159 --> 6287.92
just traveled beyond in another realm

6285.76 --> 6290.400000000001
yeah sure then it could be possible

6287.92 --> 6292.4
maybe if there is really

6290.4 --> 6295.839999999999
that if if that opportunity at some

6292.4 --> 6295.839999999999
point had presented itself

6297.6 --> 6301.1990000000005
whales to eat well you don't find whales

6300.88 --> 6304.32
on

6301.199 --> 6307.44
dry land good servant right

6304.32 --> 6310.799999999999
yeah at the ice wall they could have

6307.44 --> 6313.36
gone at the ice wall in proximity to it

6310.8 --> 6315.04
and just ate a bunch of whales perhaps

6313.36 --> 6317.679
they were curious at some point or

6315.04 --> 6320.96
something or they were told by the

6317.679 --> 6323.36
like the atlantean kings

6320.96 --> 6324.88
like yeah you need to explore that and

6323.36 --> 6328.839999999999
then they would have gone there but

6324.88 --> 6330.56
they're not gonna just cross a giant

6328.84 --> 6332.159000000001
icescape

6330.56 --> 6334.0
what are they gonna eat there's no

6332.159 --> 6336.0
there's no whales on land

6334.0 --> 6338.239
and like how long are you gonna last if

6336.0 --> 6339.04
you're a really big giant that's not

6338.239 --> 6341.678999999999
used to

6339.04 --> 6344.0
eating just to survive like that because

6341.679 --> 6345.92
you're not close to pyramids

6344.0 --> 6348.08
how many whales do you would have to

6345.92 --> 6349.52
carry

6348.08 --> 6351.28
and how far would they have come with

6349.52 --> 6354.8
that they would have just

6351.28 --> 6358.08
been shoving that [ __ ] and then run out

6354.8 --> 6360.8
quickly so yeah depending on how

6358.08 --> 6361.92
big antarctica or that region really is

6360.8 --> 6365.6
of course

6361.92 --> 6366.4
but no i don't think it doesn't seem too

6365.6 --> 6370.0
likely to me

6366.4 --> 6372.5599999999995
unless it wasn't always frozen

6370.0 --> 6374.96
if it wasn't frozen at any point during

6372.56 --> 6376.0
any of those eras where the titan-sized

6374.96 --> 6377.84
giants were

6376.0 --> 6380.0
then they might have just moved across

6377.84 --> 6380.0
it

6380.239 --> 6388.4
penguins like no penguins

6383.84 --> 6391.6
only are at the ocean again good servant

6388.4 --> 6392.0
because there's no food land inwards

6391.6 --> 6396.0
it's

6392.0 --> 6398.48
only ice nothing can live there

6396.0 --> 6402.239
no pink penguins only stay at the coast

6398.48 --> 6402.239
whales only stay in the ocean

6413.6 --> 6417.679
and like why would they even want to do

6415.679 --> 6420.639
that

6417.679 --> 6422.4800000000005
if it was as icy as it is now like why

6420.639 --> 6425.04
why would they want to go there

6422.48 --> 6429.44
why would they risk their giant lives to

6425.04 --> 6431.5199999999995
do that

6429.44 --> 6433.04
like they're not really going to be able

6431.52 --> 6436.719
to make it a viable

6433.04 --> 6441.28
path to whatever is beyond there

6436.719 --> 6444.8
right what what use is it for the atlant

6441.28 --> 6447.199
for the atlantean empire or the kingdom

6444.8 --> 6449.76
the whatever what it was for atlantis

6447.199 --> 6452.96
what use would it be to

6449.76 --> 6456.320000000001
send somebody across just a unattainable

6452.96 --> 6458.2390000000005
ice skate

6456.32 --> 6460.639
what are they going to do with it

6458.239 --> 6460.638999999999
nothing

6466.4 --> 6473.5199999999995
but hey maybe i'm wrong

6469.6 --> 6476.400000000001
maybe at some point a giant did try to

6473.52 --> 6478.88
try to get across and then just ended up

6476.4 --> 6481.5199999999995
like ah

6478.88 --> 6483.119
it's too far frick i'm too far in i

6481.52 --> 6486.56
can't i'm gonna die

6483.119 --> 6486.88
and just died right there on the ice and

6486.56 --> 6490.88
then

6486.88 --> 6495.04
over time kind of like melted its way

6490.88 --> 6496.2390000000005
into the ice or got covered by other ice

6495.04 --> 6498.96
layered i don't know

6496.239 --> 6500.4
and something maybe there is a giant

6498.96 --> 6502.719
frozen

6500.4 --> 6505.199
somewhere in antarctica deep inside of

6502.719 --> 6509.679
the ice layer

6505.199 --> 6509.678999999999
somewhere land inwards i don't know

6510.56 --> 6514.8
it would certainly be a fascinating find

6521.679 --> 6526.719
said to be a land beyond antarctica as

6524.08 --> 6530.159
large as america yeah

6526.719 --> 6533.76
i know admiral byrd said that

6530.159 --> 6533.759999999999
but yeah

6534.159 --> 6538.159
admiral byrd had specific technology

6537.119 --> 6540.32
available

6538.159 --> 6542.5599999999995
and really the mission to do that

6540.32 --> 6545.599999999999
exploration in a much more

6542.56 --> 6548.8
in a different age and

6545.6 --> 6549.76
who's yeah who says that the atlanteans

6548.8 --> 6552.88
would have been

6549.76 --> 6555.280000000001
capable of exploring there

6552.88 --> 6557.28
right but yeah it's so it's all

6555.28 --> 6559.5199999999995
speculation though

6557.28 --> 6562.32
it's interesting to think about it

6559.52 --> 6565.280000000001
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

6562.32 --> 6565.28
time has flown

6565.76 --> 6570.4800000000005
it was very interesting i'm gonna
