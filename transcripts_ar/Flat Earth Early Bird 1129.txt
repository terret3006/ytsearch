118.719 --> 120.96
yeah

121.119 --> 123.68
it's

122.079 --> 126.55999999999999
skipped out

123.68 --> 131.03900000000002
yesterday explain

126.56 --> 131.03900000000002
anyway the weather now is super misty

131.2 --> 133.67999999999998
check it out

137.92 --> 143.39999999999998
so yeah

139.76 --> 143.39999999999998
it's moist outside

160.48 --> 168.92
all right

162.56 --> 168.92000000000002
it is tuesday the 18th of january 2022

170.4 --> 175.519
hey good servant first in chat

172.8 --> 175.519
good to see you

177.36 --> 180.239
yeah i'm

178.319 --> 184.92
feeling better

180.239 --> 184.92000000000002
yesterday i was just completely broken

185.36 --> 189.59900000000002
but yeah nothing like that's going to

187.04 --> 192.56
happen again

189.599 --> 195.44
because this time

192.56 --> 197.84
is a complicated situation

195.44 --> 198.959
but might seem more simple than it

197.84 --> 202.159
really is

198.959 --> 205.04
but basically yeah i tapped into the

202.159 --> 207.599
infamous bottle again sunday i don't

205.04 --> 211.04
even know why i did it

207.599 --> 212.959
and yeah i got really sick from it like

211.04 --> 215.04
i didn't think it was gonna be that bad

212.959 --> 216.879
but it did uh and but it's not gonna

215.04 --> 219.67999999999998
happen again because this time i flushed

216.879 --> 219.67999999999998
it down the toilet

220.48 --> 225.2
and

222.56 --> 226.879
i'm relieved that i got myself as far as

225.2 --> 230.23899999999998
to doing that

226.879 --> 230.239
because it's just not worth it

231.04 --> 233.84
going there again

234.4 --> 236.64000000000001
right

237.68 --> 241.59900000000002
but yeah yesterday i've i slept most of

240.64 --> 243.439
the

241.599 --> 244.39999999999998
time well yeah i didn't start out

243.439 --> 246.07999999999998
because

244.4 --> 250.159
pretty much the entirety of the sunday

246.08 --> 250.15900000000002
night i was not able to sleep

252.48 --> 257.84
last time was bad too yeah

255.92 --> 260.88
yeah but that time i kind of did

257.84 --> 263.11999999999995
expected it because i pushed it

260.88 --> 264.71999999999997
this time i thought like oh just

263.12 --> 268.32
one or two little

264.72 --> 270.639
but no absolutely no it was but it's

268.32 --> 270.639
yeah

271.12 --> 279.28000000000003
the bottle was too old the herb

274.88 --> 281.199
the absentee herb had been basically

279.28 --> 284.23999999999995
sitting in there for too long it was too

281.199 --> 286.639
concentrated it's just not

284.24 --> 288.08
not good it's almost pure poison at this

286.639 --> 291.6
point or was

288.08 --> 291.59999999999997
because now it's in the sewers

292.0 --> 295.36
so yeah that's not gonna happen again

294.08 --> 297.919
not gonna be

295.36 --> 301.12
tricked by myself

297.919 --> 301.12
into going there again

302.639 --> 308.88
but yeah in a way it is to be expected

305.84 --> 310.479
because why because sunday

308.88 --> 313.36
i peaked

310.479 --> 315.59999999999997
very much so anybody who's seen my

313.36 --> 317.44
sunday show realizes that it was a

315.6 --> 321.28000000000003
really good show

317.44 --> 321.28
i was super focused

321.36 --> 324.8
and

323.68 --> 327.44
yeah

324.8 --> 330.479
after that it usually does happen that i

327.44 --> 332.56
crash it's almost like i push the crash

330.479 --> 335.039
to get back to the peak again as soon as

332.56 --> 335.039
possible

335.6 --> 339.6
i think

337.84 --> 342.79999999999995
all very intuitive

339.6 --> 345.12
but yeah it's not gonna happen again

342.8 --> 346.88
because it was terrible

345.12 --> 350.0
yesterday was

346.88 --> 353.84
mostly just agony

350.0 --> 353.84
it really was it was really terrible

355.039 --> 358.71999999999997
and uh

356.4 --> 362.479
yeah today i feel a lot better but all

358.72 --> 365.36
in all i've slept so much it's crazy

362.479 --> 369.199
this night i slept 12 hours

365.36 --> 369.199
yesterday during the daytime i

370.08 --> 375.919
once i was finally able to sleep i slept

372.639 --> 375.919
a whole lot as well

379.199 --> 384.319
all right just thinking back about it

381.52 --> 386.88
back to it makes me a little nauseated

384.319 --> 388.56
so i'm just trying to

386.88 --> 392.15999999999997
focus

388.56 --> 392.16
right hello kevlar good to see you

392.24 --> 395.84000000000003
it is good to be back

397.85 --> 402.40000000000003
[Music]

399.68 --> 405.6
right but yeah there's another part

402.4 --> 407.039
that's kind of driven all this

405.6 --> 409.28000000000003
doing this

407.039 --> 412.31899999999996
and that's that my financial situation

409.28 --> 415.67999999999995
is really painful right now

412.319 --> 415.68
i'm so on the edge of broke

416.24 --> 419.52
i've already been like that

419.84 --> 424.88
sunday

420.84 --> 427.599
somewhere as a joke i beg to nathan

424.88 --> 430.08
like if i could have 10 euros i could

427.599 --> 432.8
get through tuesday

430.08 --> 434.88
and he gave it to me and that's why

432.8 --> 436.56
that's why i'm not currently perfectly

434.88 --> 437.52
broke

436.56 --> 440.08
right

437.52 --> 441.28
that's the reason and it's like

440.08 --> 443.68
painful

441.28 --> 443.67999999999995
because

443.759 --> 449.12
whether it is meant to or not or simply

446.72 --> 451.68
because of opportunity out there

449.12 --> 453.68
i feel like when i don't get

451.68 --> 456.479
finances that i need

453.68 --> 459.84000000000003
i feel like i fail

456.479 --> 462.84
and yeah since sunday

459.84 --> 467.19899999999996
was so great i just felt

462.84 --> 467.19899999999996
like what am i doing this for

472.24 --> 474.56
right

475.68 --> 483.52
giving it my all for nothing

480.8 --> 487.199
and yeah i talked to my healer

483.52 --> 489.599
about it too it's quite emotional even

487.199 --> 492.56
and yeah i was in a bad shape he helped

489.599 --> 494.0
me out he also gave me basic sort of

492.56 --> 496.72
training

494.0 --> 498.8
and i'm gonna try to do that even more

496.72 --> 501.28000000000003
but how to

498.8 --> 503.759
actively

501.28 --> 505.11999999999995
get in my body

503.759 --> 507.84000000000003
sounds weird

505.12 --> 507.84000000000003
but

508.72 --> 514.159
there is like a it's very similar to

511.44 --> 515.68
prayer except

514.159 --> 517.919
it's more about

515.68 --> 520.0799999999999
energy it's complicated

517.919 --> 522.159
but i've tried it yesterday night and it

520.08 --> 524.159
worked pretty decently and the funny

522.159 --> 527.279
thing is if it really works

524.159 --> 528.8
you get immediate physical responses

527.279 --> 532.08
from your body

528.8 --> 535.64
like immediately it's like oh we're back

532.08 --> 535.64
to business again

542.56 --> 544.88
right

545.12 --> 550.64
i'll get back to that at some point try

547.519 --> 553.12
next because i i'm gonna trade it

550.64 --> 556.08
i'm gonna get better at it

553.12 --> 556.08
right hello crockett

556.24 --> 559.8
good to see you

566.0 --> 569.36
all right

566.88 --> 569.36
so yeah

570.48 --> 574.88
i might not be sick anymore but not all

572.72 --> 576.399
is better

574.88 --> 579.4399999999999
although

576.399 --> 581.92
i did bump into a news article

579.44 --> 585.839
this morning that was

581.92 --> 585.8389999999999
actually good news for a change

588.48 --> 591.839
because

589.36 --> 594.16
in the net it's in dutch news

591.839 --> 596.08
they've been trying to get like the v

594.16 --> 597.8389999999999
passport thing

596.08 --> 599.76
integrated

597.839 --> 601.6
but it seems like there's been a tipping

599.76 --> 603.6
point they literally call it a tipping

601.6 --> 606.24
point where it's now

603.6 --> 607.76
come afloat that

606.24 --> 609.92
no matter how

607.76 --> 614.16
they arrange the data

609.92 --> 617.12
it's just not effective the policy

614.16 --> 619.1999999999999
and that's now

617.12 --> 622.88
like settled pretty much

619.2 --> 625.839
apparently in our cabinet and all that

622.88 --> 628.16
so that means that it's gonna end

625.839 --> 630.6400000000001
it does mean that

628.16 --> 632.88
like nobody's buying it it's not gonna

630.64 --> 634.64
get like there's not gonna be a v

632.88 --> 635.92
passport

634.64 --> 638.3199999999999
they're not gonna

635.92 --> 639.76
forward the agenda and aggravate it as

638.32 --> 642.0790000000001
they always do

639.76 --> 644.8
it's it's completely at a dead run and

642.079 --> 649.399
i'm really happy to hear that i

644.8 --> 649.399
can't wait to see more about that

655.59 --> 658.82
[Music]

668.8 --> 671.5999999999999
right

670.0 --> 674.48
because there there have been like

671.6 --> 677.36
they've been like doing qr codes and

674.48 --> 679.76
things and this whole mechanism of going

677.36 --> 681.6800000000001
about here

679.76 --> 683.76
and

681.68 --> 685.04
like without

683.76 --> 688.16
forced

685.04 --> 690.079
these involved to get that is just oh no

688.16 --> 691.68
you got it oh you're gonna get tested oh

690.079 --> 693.68
you

691.68 --> 695.76
blah blah blah you had it then you get a

693.68 --> 697.519
qr code or something like that it's like

695.76 --> 698.959
all kinds of tests like even my

697.519 --> 702.079
stepmother

698.959 --> 703.5999999999999
during christmas talked about it

702.079 --> 705.76
i would remember how she was going to

703.6 --> 707.519
get a test to get qr codes so things

705.76 --> 710.16
would be a lot easier etc that's because

707.519 --> 712.639
of the roll out of this thing and it

710.16 --> 714.0
seems like it's grinding to a dead halt

712.639 --> 717.839
now

714.0 --> 717.839
really happy and relieved about that

719.2 --> 724.48
right

720.48 --> 724.48
so yeah i'll keep you guys up to date

729.519 --> 734.76
let's see

731.519 --> 734.76
what else

750.639 --> 753.639
what

775.2 --> 778.639
hmm

776.399 --> 779.92
right bump justin bumped into something

778.639 --> 782.8
but i don't know what to think about

779.92 --> 782.8
that yet anyway

784.639 --> 789.2
had a dream that the egg was destroyed

787.36 --> 790.32
last night wow

789.2 --> 793.36
the goods

790.32 --> 793.36
that sounds creepy

793.44 --> 798.8000000000001
i had a lot of dreams too

796.16 --> 801.12
this night

798.8 --> 804.639
and i have been having dreams like but

801.12 --> 806.0
yesterday my dreams were terrible

804.639 --> 808.5600000000001
like they were

806.0 --> 811.68
actual night i did i haven't had actual

808.56 --> 814.7199999999999
nightmares like that in a long time

811.68 --> 817.12
hope they won't come back

814.72 --> 819.44
because they were

817.12 --> 820.8
basically relivings

819.44 --> 823.44
of

820.8 --> 825.12
well nightmarish situations especially

823.44 --> 828.48
the feeling

825.12 --> 830.639
of things that happen in my past when

828.48 --> 832.399
dealing with really [ __ ] up people and

830.639 --> 834.48
basically

832.399 --> 835.68
turning myself off in a way just to be

834.48 --> 838.0
able to

835.68 --> 843.12
go about

838.0 --> 845.36
and i felt that back that's like

843.12 --> 849.839
that's so such a terrible sensation it

845.36 --> 849.839
literally makes me burst out crying

850.24 --> 853.92
it's yeah it's just pain

854.8 --> 859.199
right so i relived a lot of nightmares

857.279 --> 861.68
from my past and

859.199 --> 863.04
it's like every time i drink that absent

861.68 --> 865.519
crap

863.04 --> 868.639
like it connects me with every previous

865.519 --> 871.44
time it's really weird because my mind

868.639 --> 873.839
starts to work differently

871.44 --> 875.9200000000001
and this the dreaming it's so weird i'm

873.839 --> 878.0790000000001
glad i flushed it all down the toilet i

875.92 --> 878.079
hope

878.399 --> 883.48
i'll never have the seduction ever again

892.639 --> 897.199
right but yeah the this night i had

894.48 --> 899.6
better dreams is just

897.199 --> 902.0
dreams about women again

899.6 --> 904.72
and that's not just sex guys i don't

902.0 --> 905.68
just oh i dream of orgies so thank god

904.72 --> 907.519
no

905.68 --> 908.399
it'll be gross

907.519 --> 910.88
no

908.399 --> 913.199
i dream just a regular interaction of

910.88 --> 916.959
what it is to

913.199 --> 916.959
to have a relationship and all that

917.44 --> 922.0
so they're really nice dreams i'm almost

919.6 --> 926.1990000000001
trying to

922.0 --> 926.199
see if i can still do it

928.399 --> 931.839
if i can still

929.92 --> 934.4799999999999
allow myself to go there in a

931.839 --> 934.48
relationship

937.6 --> 942.72
and yeah

938.8 --> 942.7199999999999
because of women and how they are

947.6 --> 949.36
and

948.48 --> 951.36
like

949.36 --> 954.639
in the past what did i actually find

951.36 --> 956.8000000000001
attractive or was i just trying to get

954.639 --> 960.32
in their pants a lot of guys typically

956.8 --> 962.079
do well yeah in most cases i was but now

960.32 --> 964.72
it's like even

962.079 --> 966.959
yesterday during some of the were better

964.72 --> 969.1990000000001
not so nice dreams

966.959 --> 970.399
it's like i was getting my face shoved

969.199 --> 972.24
into that

970.399 --> 974.32
like look at what you did look at what

972.24 --> 976.5600000000001
you what you were doing

974.32 --> 979.0400000000001
you ignored these things you potentially

976.56 --> 983.8389999999999
hurt them just because you were only

979.04 --> 983.8389999999999
thinking about that one thing you wanted

990.399 --> 993.36
all right

992.0 --> 994.839
and i don't want to do it like that

993.36 --> 999.04
anymore i

994.839 --> 999.0400000000001
want relationship to be

1000.16 --> 1005.12
wise

1002.56 --> 1005.1199999999999
and clear

1008.0 --> 1011.0
anyway

1036.64 --> 1040.3190000000002
right but i don't think that the hague

1038.4 --> 1042.24
is gonna get destroyed anytime soon

1040.319 --> 1044.3999999999999
besides what what what would that even

1042.24 --> 1044.4
do

1045.36 --> 1050.3999999999999
except destroy a big state city in my

1047.919 --> 1051.44
country which you don't want

1050.4 --> 1054.3200000000002
right

1051.44 --> 1055.76
but it wouldn't stop it just because the

1054.32 --> 1056.8799999999999
court system

1055.76 --> 1059.76
is

1056.88 --> 1061.0390000000002
the world courts

1059.76 --> 1063.44
is there

1061.039 --> 1066.08
doesn't mean that oh it's destroyed now

1063.44 --> 1068.799
there's no more no they'll just appoint

1066.08 --> 1070.48
another city and then all the lawyers

1068.799 --> 1072.08
and all that

1070.48 --> 1074.32
that are part of that which are not

1072.08 --> 1075.6789999999999
going to be all in the same building all

1074.32 --> 1077.84
the time

1075.679 --> 1080.48
they're just going to move to that right

1077.84 --> 1084.28
so don't have to be afraid that it's the

1080.48 --> 1084.28
entire thing is that vulnerable

1095.28 --> 1099.3999999999999
okay the goods that's weird

1111.28 --> 1116.32
oh that kind of a dream like it all

1113.6 --> 1118.24
broke apart

1116.32 --> 1120.84
yeah those those are very interesting

1118.24 --> 1123.76
symbolic dreams when that happens

1120.84 --> 1125.4399999999998
yeah it's like

1123.76 --> 1127.679
a building of some kind it looks all

1125.44 --> 1128.1000000000001
really solid and then one thing doesn't

1127.679 --> 1130.0
work

1128.1 --> 1132.1599999999999
[Music]

1130.0 --> 1135.36
like you said try to close the window on

1132.16 --> 1138.4
some creature getting in this big spider

1135.36 --> 1140.4799999999998
then it won't close and then suddenly

1138.4 --> 1142.5590000000002
things start falling apart apart like a

1140.48 --> 1144.96
house of cards yeah that's inter those

1142.559 --> 1147.76
are very interesting symbolic dreams

1144.96 --> 1150.849
i've had my share of those

1147.76 --> 1150.849

thank you thanks for all the hard work

1256.64 --> 1260.88
you do keep crushing thank you very much

1259.44 --> 1263.44
however

1260.88 --> 1265.919
i actually quite desperate

1263.44 --> 1268.64
for donations right now

1265.919 --> 1270.64
and super chat donations i don't really

1268.64 --> 1272.4
get any of that

1270.64 --> 1273.679
so

1272.4 --> 1274.96
please

1273.679 --> 1276.4
if you can

1274.96 --> 1278.88
use the paypal

1276.4 --> 1280.24
because then i get it get almost all of

1278.88 --> 1283.6000000000001
it

1280.24 --> 1286.88
the vast majority and i get it quickly

1283.6 --> 1288.799
but i appreciate the super chat

1286.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
flattered sage

1288.799 --> 1291.84
thank you

1294.92 --> 1298.799
[Music]

1299.52 --> 1303.039
you know that i actually considered

1301.679 --> 1305.039
turning off

1303.039 --> 1306.08
the super chat system just because of

1305.039 --> 1309.039
that

1306.08 --> 1311.039
but yeah i don't know how to

1309.039 --> 1313.36
so it's kind of just a billboard that's

1311.039 --> 1315.039
kind of expensive to the ones that use

1313.36 --> 1317.4399999999998
it

1315.039 --> 1320.96
because i barely get any of it

1317.44 --> 1322.72
it is a fun way to communicate though

1320.96 --> 1325.3600000000001
anyway

1322.72 --> 1327.84
if you still have some left then please

1325.36 --> 1330.7199999999998
donate to my paypal

1327.84 --> 1332.72

1344.0 --> 1348.72
like i am depleting in all my sources

1357.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
anyway

1358.88 --> 1361.8400000000001

like with the anti-flat earthers and all

1440.4 --> 1443.52

except that they're trying to all now

1445.44 --> 1450.24
gas light

1447.6 --> 1451.9189999999999
about the sexton

1450.24 --> 1454.0
they're all kind of desperate oh look

1451.919 --> 1456.24
it's very easy to use it on the on the

1454.0 --> 1458.96
ball earth

1456.24 --> 1461.76
so they're doing that which is all

1458.96 --> 1461.76
preposterous

1463.44 --> 1467.0800000000002
and very late

1474.48 --> 1476.72
huh

1481.84 --> 1487.6399999999999
uh brian had a couple of

1484.64 --> 1487.64
shorts

1493.52 --> 1496.96
oh wait yeah that's

1496.0 --> 1498.559
yeah

1496.96 --> 1500.559
i'm a little mixed up i didn't really

1498.559 --> 1503.6789999999999
watch a lot of youtube yesterday i was

1500.559 --> 1503.6789999999999
mostly just sleeping

1509.2 --> 1514.1200000000001
made by jimbock was live and that was

1511.12 --> 1514.12
awesome

1515.68 --> 1520.919
[Music]

1516.88 --> 1520.919
did manage to catch that

1524.35 --> 1527.74
[Music]

1530.96 --> 1535.6000000000001
right or we could talk more some some

1533.2 --> 1537.679
more about dreams you know i did still

1535.6 --> 1541.8799999999999
have a lot of dreams it's just that

1537.679 --> 1541.88
because they were quite unpleasant

1551.12 --> 1555.039
when i have like really pleasant dreams

1553.12 --> 1557.039
again or that word that stand out in

1555.039 --> 1560.559
some special way

1557.039 --> 1562.48
because i do dream a lot like

1560.559 --> 1565.76
when i even when i'm normal again but

1562.48 --> 1568.0
it's also it's almost always just me

1565.76 --> 1572.1589999999999
trying to puzzle

1568.0 --> 1572.159
human interactions usually with women

1572.559 --> 1577.44
and i'm not even talking about oh if i

1574.64 --> 1580.3200000000002
say this how will i don't it's not even

1577.44 --> 1582.88
about the words like sometimes in my

1580.32 --> 1586.24
human interactions there's like no words

1582.88 --> 1587.8400000000001
involved at all it's all just feelings

1586.24 --> 1590.72
all of it it's just

1587.84 --> 1592.08
woman feeling and radiating

1590.72 --> 1594.64
and me

1592.08 --> 1596.96
being in a certain composure feeling and

1594.64 --> 1599.279
radiating like i'm experimenting with

1596.96 --> 1602.24
non-verbal communication in my dreams or

1599.279 --> 1604.24
something that happens a lot

1602.24 --> 1608.039
now

1604.24 --> 1608.039
in the last month

1619.919 --> 1624.24
what's my view on astral projection

1622.32 --> 1627.52
or just bunk no

1624.24 --> 1630.159
no no no well it all depends

1627.52 --> 1630.96
on exactly

1630.159 --> 1633.2
what

1630.96 --> 1637.039
what you're seeing is astral projection

1633.2 --> 1637.039
if you mean like out of body

1638.84 --> 1644.0
observations or

1641.84 --> 1646.399
right because it's a projection it's

1644.0 --> 1649.039
like your spirit projection outside of

1646.399 --> 1651.52
your body that sort of astral projection

1649.039 --> 1653.2
or you talk because there's multiple

1651.52 --> 1655.44
ways to designate it

1653.2 --> 1656.88
or simply like what i call dark world

1655.44 --> 1660.559
experiences

1656.88 --> 1663.679
where you are in a dream realm

1660.559 --> 1665.9189999999999
for prolonged time usually and then

1663.679 --> 1668.64
it's like a holodeck around you but

1665.919 --> 1672.159
other entities can also

1668.64 --> 1672.159
like approach you there

1673.6 --> 1676.9599999999998
so

1674.399 --> 1676.9599999999998
which one

1677.679 --> 1682.919
because i've had a lot of dark world

1679.919 --> 1682.919
experiences

1718.559 --> 1721.2
right ob

1721.679 --> 1727.1200000000001
so you were talking about basically

1723.52 --> 1729.84
spirit projection in the waking world

1727.12 --> 1732.7199999999998
yeah yeah that's real that's all real it

1729.84 --> 1735.76
was always real it's been like

1732.72 --> 1739.2
researched by official departments and

1735.76 --> 1741.12
[ __ ] it's real it's very very real

1739.2 --> 1744.96
it's also something that's not going to

1741.12 --> 1744.9599999999998
be like a standard skill

1746.08 --> 1748.48
because it's

1747.12 --> 1750.399
actually not

1748.48 --> 1751.6
all that great for you

1750.399 --> 1753.279
to do that

1751.6 --> 1755.76
because what is it what you do you're

1753.279 --> 1756.559
effectively

1755.76 --> 1761.279
well

1756.559 --> 1761.279
disconnecting your spirit from your body

1762.08 --> 1766.08
that's really not healthy

1764.159 --> 1768.5590000000002
right

1766.08 --> 1770.24
like an occasional experience like that

1768.559 --> 1772.32
might be interesting

1770.24 --> 1774.96
but let's just say theoretically you're

1772.32 --> 1775.9189999999999
gonna do that every day

1774.96 --> 1778.0
uh

1775.919 --> 1779.6000000000001
i'll bet you

1778.0 --> 1782.24
i'll bet you you're going to get into

1779.6 --> 1785.36
big trouble

1782.24 --> 1786.88
either health problems or

1785.36 --> 1789.279
you suddenly

1786.88 --> 1791.44
might be like locked outside of your

1789.279 --> 1793.6
body and then somebody else taking over

1791.44 --> 1794.3990000000001
your body or something else

1793.6 --> 1795.52
yeah

1794.399 --> 1798.399
dude

1795.52 --> 1798.399
it's dangerous

1801.279 --> 1805.52
because yeah remember i talked about

1804.24 --> 1806.96
earlier

1805.52 --> 1809.52
with my healer

1806.96 --> 1810.32
about getting yourself in your body

1809.52 --> 1812.399
right

1810.32 --> 1814.1589999999999
that's what you need that's where

1812.399 --> 1815.279
actually the really good things come

1814.159 --> 1817.2
from

1815.279 --> 1819.2
is being inside your body so it's safe

1817.2 --> 1820.48
to say that

1819.2 --> 1823.039
moving your

1820.48 --> 1824.72
spirit outside of your body to do things

1823.039 --> 1827.279
in the physical world

1824.72 --> 1830.32
is pretty much exactly the opposite of

1827.279 --> 1832.399
what is healthy to you

1830.32 --> 1834.1589999999999
you see how that works out

1832.399 --> 1838.4799999999998
right it doesn't mean it's not possible

1834.159 --> 1838.48
it's just that it's not recommended

1841.76 --> 1844.799
it might

1842.96 --> 1847.279
weaken you

1844.799 --> 1849.52
there might like i could only even

1847.279 --> 1853.039
imagine doing anything like that if i

1849.52 --> 1855.279
was like seething seething

1853.039 --> 1858.24
like i was 20 years old with energy and

1855.279 --> 1860.48
confidence like so much spirit

1858.24 --> 1862.159
that i could just afford to basically

1860.48 --> 1864.96
split up

1862.159 --> 1867.8400000000001
like that but then

1864.96 --> 1870.64
if i had done that really a lot with

1867.84 --> 1873.1999999999998
crazy people dangerous

1870.64 --> 1875.44
dangerous spirits around me

1873.2 --> 1877.44
then that might have absolutely

1875.44 --> 1881.679
destroyed me

1877.44 --> 1884.0
it ended up happening in another way

1881.679 --> 1886.64
because i got basically trapped in dark

1884.0 --> 1888.48
world for 80 years

1886.64 --> 1890.48
right which in the physical reality

1888.48 --> 1893.2
turned into five minutes didn't

1890.48 --> 1895.279
literally just sit there for 80 years or

1893.2 --> 1896.559
something

1895.279 --> 1898.559
but

1896.559 --> 1900.1589999999999
yeah

1898.559 --> 1902.08
that's what you when you're probably

1900.159 --> 1903.7600000000002
going to do it when you're still very

1902.08 --> 1905.84
young and you're super overconfident

1903.76 --> 1908.64
have so much energy you literally feel

1905.84 --> 1909.76
like bursting out of your skin

1908.64 --> 1911.919
and then

1909.76 --> 1914.0
it might almost come natural to you to

1911.919 --> 1915.279
try something like that

1914.0 --> 1917.679
but

1915.279 --> 1921.84
it's like you're

1917.679 --> 1922.799
gambling with all that spirit energy

1921.84 --> 1926.32
because

1922.799 --> 1929.679
what if things go wrong and they can

1926.32 --> 1931.9189999999999
then you'll suddenly lose it all

1929.679 --> 1931.919
right

1932.0 --> 1938.32
i wouldn't i wouldn't risk it unless

1934.88 --> 1938.3200000000002
yeah not even unless and

1940.159 --> 1943.7600000000002
i don't know i don't understand the

1941.84 --> 1946.1589999999999
conditions under which that would be

1943.76 --> 1948.24
advisable

1946.159 --> 1949.919
i've personally never bumped in into any

1948.24 --> 1951.919
such situation where it was like yeah

1949.919 --> 1953.2
this is now where need to do now we need

1951.919 --> 1954.7990000000002
to do that

1953.2 --> 1957.3600000000001
because usually everything you can do

1954.799 --> 1962.12
with astro projection you can easily do

1957.36 --> 1962.12
in some other way without going there

1963.039 --> 1966.96
right unless you're just not supposed to

1966.0 --> 1969.519
know

1966.96 --> 1972.48
right if you're going to be a spy with

1969.519 --> 1976.24
that [ __ ] which is the reason most

1972.48 --> 1979.6
people was witchy types do it yeah

1976.24 --> 1979.6
that's completely wrong

1979.76 --> 1984.64
it's like breaking privacy and [ __ ]

1982.0 --> 1987.36
that's just wrong dark

1984.64 --> 1989.6000000000001
right you're already tainted even if you

1987.36 --> 1991.1999999999998
want to do it for that reason

1989.6 --> 1993.12
you're tainted

1991.2 --> 1996.0800000000002
when you do that

1993.12 --> 1996.08
when you want to do that

1999.76 --> 2005.48
is lucid dreaming safer yeah

2002.48 --> 2005.48
absolutely

2016.96 --> 2019.279
there's nothing wrong with lucid

2018.24 --> 2023.6
dreaming i

2019.279 --> 2023.6
i have it regularly where i'm like

2024.559 --> 2030.1589999999999
suddenly find myself into a

2028.24 --> 2031.36
virtual reality

2030.159 --> 2033.279
view

2031.36 --> 2035.4399999999998
of a dream

2033.279 --> 2037.2
and then actually like okay i'm going to

2035.44 --> 2041.039
hold still now

2037.2 --> 2043.3600000000001
and look at this pattern here like this

2041.039 --> 2044.8799999999999
this weird piece of rock or something

2043.36 --> 2047.36
anything

2044.88 --> 2051.52
with a shape that's there

2047.36 --> 2051.52
and then i literally see it

2051.919 --> 2056.879
i literally see it like i'm seeing a

2054.56 --> 2058.639
shape

2056.879 --> 2061.359
behind my closed eyes and it's like

2058.639 --> 2064.879
really a shape my mind is like made up

2061.359 --> 2064.879
that's physically there

2065.599 --> 2070.159
now that's lucid

2068.399 --> 2073.5989999999997
because it's not like in a half

2070.159 --> 2076.32
distracted dream state which is normal

2073.599 --> 2079.2000000000003
but like i wake up and it's like really

2076.32 --> 2082.079
there it's there until my mind lets it

2079.2 --> 2084.3199999999997
go and then it it dissipates but like

2082.079 --> 2085.119
until that moment where i let it go it's

2084.32 --> 2089.56
like

2085.119 --> 2089.56
visually perfectly there

2090.159 --> 2094.96
i've had that many times and it's like

2092.56 --> 2096.7999999999997
it's like a miracle to me every time

2094.96 --> 2099.76
that happens it's like i am seeing

2096.8 --> 2102.079
something that isn't physically there

2099.76 --> 2105.6800000000003
but it's still there even as i realize

2102.079 --> 2107.6800000000003
it's not physically there it's there

2105.68 --> 2110.48
until i let it go and that's just

2107.68 --> 2110.48
amazing to me

2115.76 --> 2121.3590000000004
right because it's not just

2119.119 --> 2124.079
your inner space your imagination inner

2121.359 --> 2127.04
space while you're awake you can see

2124.079 --> 2129.76
things but it's always like a half

2127.04 --> 2132.32
transparent vague thing that when you

2129.76 --> 2134.32
focus on it clears up

2132.32 --> 2136.4
and you unfocus and then it's kind of

2134.32 --> 2137.76
like yeah it doesn't really mean

2136.4 --> 2140.079
anything

2137.76 --> 2142.079
but in this case

2140.079 --> 2145.28
like

2142.079 --> 2148.8
when you focus on it

2145.28 --> 2151.28
with eyes closed you really see it

2148.8 --> 2153.8390000000004
you actually see it as if it was really

2151.28 --> 2154.8
there like a hollow holodeck

2153.839 --> 2158.2799999999997
thing

2154.8 --> 2158.28
and that's amazing

2160.16 --> 2166.3199999999997
i've had that like several times

2164.0 --> 2169.2
in the last year alone

2166.32 --> 2172.2400000000002
right and that falls in what i think

2169.2 --> 2174.96
would be classified as lucid dreaming

2172.24 --> 2177.4399999999996
where literally your inner

2174.96 --> 2178.96
thing your brain just

2177.44 --> 2181.68
makes

2178.96 --> 2185.079
the visuals real

2181.68 --> 2185.0789999999997
that's amazing

2196.72 --> 2202.0789999999997
and i think that that is also

2198.88 --> 2203.839
the mechanism that makes that possible

2202.079 --> 2207.44
is the thing that is

2203.839 --> 2209.2799999999997
engaged when a dark world experience is

2207.44 --> 2211.44
actually happening

2209.28 --> 2213.6800000000003
when it's like on all the time

2211.44 --> 2215.32
there's like a persistent existence of

2213.68 --> 2217.04
the hollow

2215.32 --> 2218.48
representations

2217.04 --> 2220.32
and then goes as far as that you can

2218.48 --> 2222.0
actually even touch it if you're

2220.32 --> 2224.6400000000003
supposed to be able to

2222.0 --> 2229.32
because not everything in dark world is

2224.64 --> 2229.3199999999997
actually really physically real

2229.359 --> 2233.7599999999998
sometimes it's just there as an

2231.2 --> 2233.7599999999998
impression

2234.56 --> 2238.0
then you can touch it

2236.24 --> 2239.9199999999996
and sometimes it's supposed to be

2238.0 --> 2241.839
touchable as an object and then you can

2239.92 --> 2243.599
actually touch it and grab it and feel

2241.839 --> 2245.92
it it's weird

2243.599 --> 2245.92
right

2250.48 --> 2253.48
hmm

2254.44 --> 2261.2000000000003
[Music]

2280.19 --> 2283.4
[Music]

2327.44 --> 2332.2400000000002
all right but anyway to get back to your

2329.76 --> 2334.48
question flatter sage

2332.24 --> 2336.4799999999996
i think lucid dreaming would overall be

2334.48 --> 2338.0
safe you still

2336.48 --> 2340.16
like

2338.0 --> 2342.88
yeah the deeper you go into a dream

2340.16 --> 2345.92
state of any sort the more you risk

2342.88 --> 2347.359
outside entities

2345.92 --> 2349.839
getting involved

2347.359 --> 2351.359
and meddling with you right if you're

2349.839 --> 2353.2
only very lightly into your dream

2351.359 --> 2355.119
they're not gonna be able to do anything

2353.2 --> 2357.9199999999996
they're not even going to get to you

2355.119 --> 2359.839
literally in the experience

2357.92 --> 2361.839
right but

2359.839 --> 2365.2
the difference is in with lucid dreaming

2361.839 --> 2370.24
is that you're still in your body

2365.2 --> 2370.24
your spirit is still in your body so

2371.04 --> 2375.7599999999998
like

2372.88 --> 2377.52
yeah you could get a nasty experience

2375.76 --> 2380.1600000000003
out of it potentially

2377.52 --> 2381.7599999999998
bumping into some dark entity if that

2380.16 --> 2385.359
yeah if ever

2381.76 --> 2385.3590000000004
usually that doesn't really happen

2385.68 --> 2390.48
yeah but at least you can't like risk

2388.079 --> 2395.0
really separating your spirit from your

2390.48 --> 2395.0
body or something terrible like that

2397.52 --> 2401.7599999999998
right and by the way nobody would ever

2399.839 --> 2403.04
testify to that

2401.76 --> 2406.4
yeah

2403.04 --> 2410.4
because they would be gone

2406.4 --> 2412.88
another would have replaced them you see

2410.4 --> 2415.92
and so of course nobody's going to ever

2412.88 --> 2418.319
testify to oh yeah yeah i tried that

2415.92 --> 2419.359
once and then i got locked out of my

2418.319 --> 2421.839
body

2419.359 --> 2423.52
yeah because they're not going to be

2421.839 --> 2426.24
able to get back

2423.52 --> 2429.119
in order to tell you that and the person

2426.24 --> 2431.68
or whatever it was taking over is not

2429.119 --> 2434.079
going to talk about that of course

2431.68 --> 2437.52
right because they're undercover

2434.079 --> 2439.8390000000004
they've just snatched the body

2437.52 --> 2439.839
so

2465.2 --> 2469.9199999999996
i think if you have the armor of god you

2467.359 --> 2473.839
may be protected well guess what god

2469.92 --> 2473.839
does not condone you doing that

2478.72 --> 2482.0789999999997
right

2479.599 --> 2484.8
and then i don't mean like biblically

2482.079 --> 2487.28
described or anything it's just that

2484.8 --> 2489.76
it's an unsafe thing to do it's a high

2487.28 --> 2491.6800000000003
risk to take

2489.76 --> 2494.3190000000004
dark entities

2491.68 --> 2495.7599999999998
that are not favorable to humankind to

2494.319 --> 2498.48
mankind

2495.76 --> 2498.48
abuse it

2499.359 --> 2504.319
they snatch bodies with it safe to say

2502.0 --> 2506.0
that because of that risk it's not a

2504.319 --> 2508.56
thing that god would recommend you

2506.0 --> 2511.28
anybody to do

2508.56 --> 2513.2799999999997
so armor of god that doesn't matter it's

2511.28 --> 2516.0
a mechanical thing

2513.28 --> 2519.8390000000004
it's not about facing off with another

2516.0 --> 2523.839
entity it's about them literally

2519.839 --> 2523.839
sneak attacking the connection

2524.64 --> 2528.96
right you don't even have to be aware

2526.64 --> 2532.8799999999997
that it is going to happen or that it

2528.96 --> 2532.88
has happened you'll just be locked out

2533.119 --> 2538.48
suddenly you can't snap out of it

2534.64 --> 2539.7599999999998
anymore right so yeah armor of god armor

2538.48 --> 2542.72
of god is

2539.76 --> 2544.88
is about one spirit facing another

2542.72 --> 2546.48
spirit using the information which all

2544.88 --> 2550.2400000000002
comes from god

2546.48 --> 2553.2
the knowledge of god and his wisdom

2550.24 --> 2555.7599999999998
that you use that and then whatever they

2553.2 --> 2556.7999999999997
try nastiness they they

2555.76 --> 2558.96
launch

2556.8 --> 2561.119
forward at you

2558.96 --> 2563.359
is gonna like bounce off that's the

2561.119 --> 2564.8
armor of god effect that only works with

2563.359 --> 2566.24
a face off

2564.8 --> 2571.079
right

2566.24 --> 2571.0789999999997
when your spirit faces something

2579.359 --> 2584.56
would you need to separate your body to

2581.52 --> 2584.56
do remote viewing

2589.76 --> 2596.88
i don't know

2592.8 --> 2600.4
if that depends if remote viewing is

2596.88 --> 2601.92
found by the sim by the same procedure

2600.4 --> 2604.92
it might be a slightly different

2601.92 --> 2604.92
mechanism

2606.8 --> 2611.76
but if it's the same

2608.56 --> 2611.7599999999998
yeah same risks

2616.319 --> 2619.68
but i consider remote viewing and out of

2618.64 --> 2622.4
body

2619.68 --> 2624.72
project like astral traveling or without

2622.4 --> 2627.44
astral projection i consider it as

2624.72 --> 2631.9599999999996
exactly the same i don't know if it is

2627.44 --> 2631.96
mechanically perfectly the same

2634.16 --> 2637.7599999999998
right

2634.96 --> 2640.56
i think that most astral projections are

2637.76 --> 2643.119
much closer by your direct surroundings

2640.56 --> 2645.2799999999997
with limited window of time

2643.119 --> 2646.319
more ability to actually perceive

2645.28 --> 2649.599
through it

2646.319 --> 2652.56
and that remote viewing was always

2649.599 --> 2654.319
like meant like even any reference now

2652.56 --> 2656.7999999999997
is about oh they

2654.319 --> 2658.319
tested people at the cia if they could

2656.8 --> 2660.8
spy on

2658.319 --> 2662.88
a location

2660.8 --> 2664.7200000000003
right they used it they attempted to use

2662.88 --> 2666.48
it for espionage well

2664.72 --> 2669.2
i think that

2666.48 --> 2672.0
if the distance is vast

2669.2 --> 2673.04
then the spirit will be stretched

2672.0 --> 2675.04
literally

2673.04 --> 2676.88
the line between your body and your

2675.04 --> 2681.0
spirit will be stretched which would

2676.88 --> 2681.0
limit the amount of information

2696.56 --> 2701.2
right so theoretically it would be

2699.119 --> 2704.96
really easy

2701.2 --> 2707.2
to basically astroproject yourself into

2704.96 --> 2709.76
what's happening right on the other side

2707.2 --> 2709.7599999999998
of this wall

2710.56 --> 2715.2799999999997
but yeah if you want to check out

2712.8 --> 2718.4
something that's like

2715.28 --> 2721.3590000000004
thousands of kilometers away yeah that's

2718.4 --> 2724.8
gonna require like a specific type of

2721.359 --> 2728.16
focus training to even achieve that

2724.8 --> 2730.96
unless again for some peculiar reason

2728.16 --> 2733.52
you have that talent always

2730.96 --> 2736.079
i don't know

2733.52 --> 2740.319
i've never had that talent i don't even

2736.079 --> 2740.319
care for it like i don't even want that

2740.56 --> 2744.56
remote viewing what a waste of time

2744.64 --> 2748.64
the remote feeling is much easier

2749.119 --> 2752.44
much easier

2764.079 --> 2768.4
right anyway so it's a lot of spirit

2766.0 --> 2771.4
talk here now

2768.4 --> 2771.4
dreams

2778.319 --> 2781.319
so

2798.72 --> 2806.72
hmm they're negative and you won't be

2803.079 --> 2808.319
perceptive to you or vice versa

2806.72 --> 2811.1189999999997
different planes

2808.319 --> 2815.079
no fear yeah depends on how you're gonna

2811.119 --> 2815.079
tune of course

2817.76 --> 2822.8
right but that's the whole thing about

2819.68 --> 2826.3999999999996
it about remote feeling is

2822.8 --> 2829.04
what are you gonna size up

2826.4 --> 2832.48
right what feeling are you going to tune

2829.04 --> 2834.64
into to see how much of it is there

2832.48 --> 2837.04
you can attune to fear i just wouldn't

2834.64 --> 2839.2
recommend it

2837.04 --> 2840.72
but sometimes you can just feel it

2839.2 --> 2842.64
anyway

2840.72 --> 2844.7999999999997
even if you don't tune

2842.64 --> 2846.7999999999997
just by

2844.8 --> 2850.04
sending your spirit in that direction

2846.8 --> 2850.04
for sensory

2860.72 --> 2866.1189999999997
yeah good morning good gaining wisdom

2862.64 --> 2866.1189999999997
good to see you

2872.49 --> 2879.9689999999996
[Music]

2889.2 --> 2892.64
all right so anyway

2894.0 --> 2897.359
halfway through the show

2897.599 --> 2903.44
yeah i'm still uh gonna have to complain

2900.8 --> 2906.0
some more about money

2903.44 --> 2906.0
because again

2906.4 --> 2909.839
i'm

2907.92 --> 2912.88
pretty much at the edge of dead broke i

2909.839 --> 2914.88
really need some paypal donations small

2912.88 --> 2917.44
ones would do like anything at this

2914.88 --> 2917.44
point would do

2918.4 --> 2925.04
like even five bucks would matter

2921.359 --> 2928.0
so if any of you got anything

2925.04 --> 2930.5589999999997
that would just be a great relief also

2928.0 --> 2932.96
give me some more

2930.559 --> 2934.96
earthly type confidence that it's act

2932.96 --> 2938.96
that i'm actually worth it and not just

2934.96 --> 2938.96
like everybody's just being nice

2940.4 --> 2946.4
right because appreciation without

2943.28 --> 2949.44
like physical backup

2946.4 --> 2951.92
that just gives my mind

2949.44 --> 2953.04
just weird other perspectives eventually

2951.92 --> 2955.28
like i'm

2953.04 --> 2955.2799999999997
yeah

2955.359 --> 2958.64
i don't know

2956.559 --> 2961.599
i know you guys are just

2958.64 --> 2961.5989999999997
cool in chat

2961.68 --> 2966.7999999999997
and it's good having a conversation i

2963.68 --> 2966.7999999999997
like the back of forts

2967.2 --> 2970.5589999999997
but yeah

2968.88 --> 2973.92
hey that flat fellow

2970.559 --> 2973.92
thanks for the 99 cents

2975.599 --> 2981.76
anybody can spare some through paypal

2978.4 --> 2983.28
that would help me just a real big

2981.76 --> 2987.3590000000004
amount

2983.28 --> 2987.3590000000004
even if it was actually a small amount

2992.24 --> 2998.5589999999997
yeah the super chats though in yeah this

2996.16 --> 3001.359
that's not literally helping

2998.559 --> 3001.3590000000004
but it is fun

3001.599 --> 3006.319
so thanks that flat fellow you're

3003.44 --> 3008.8
helping my stats

3006.319 --> 3008.8
with that

3010.8 --> 3013.8
okay

3038.16 --> 3042.72
okay that platform look

3040.079 --> 3045.76
i appreciate you now spamming my chat

3042.72 --> 3048.0789999999997
full with the super chats but

3045.76 --> 3048.079
again

3048.319 --> 3052.5589999999997
if that's like the only thing you can

3050.319 --> 3054.8
give then just leave it to one every

3052.559 --> 3057.599
time you show up it's fun

3054.8 --> 3060.2400000000002
right it's it's not though actually

3057.599 --> 3062.319
helping my financial situation

3060.24 --> 3064.72
really it isn't unless you're literally

3062.319 --> 3068.8
going to keep on doing that for the next

3064.72 --> 3072.0
hour until you've donated like

3068.8 --> 3074.2400000000002
99 euros like a hundred times right but

3072.0 --> 3075.359
that's going to be kind of obstructive

3074.24 --> 3079.319
so

3075.359 --> 3079.319
i appreciate the gesture

3082.24 --> 3087.24
let's just stick to

3083.839 --> 3087.24
chat participation

3100.24 --> 3106.1189999999997
right anyway

3101.92 --> 3106.119
what was i talking about again

3114.16 --> 3118.04
oh yeah remote viewing

3133.599 --> 3139.6400000000003
that's all you can do all right that's

3135.359 --> 3139.64
the fellow i appreciate that

3159.28 --> 3164.4
seems like the mist is clearing up also

3161.92 --> 3164.4
a little

3164.96 --> 3167.839
that's good

3168.24 --> 3173.319
otherwise i get so moist when i go out

3170.16 --> 3173.319
for groceries

3212.079 --> 3216.6400000000003
stopped watching remote viewing videos

3214.319 --> 3219.04
when they said iss had people in it

3216.64 --> 3222.5589999999997
that's amazing

3219.04 --> 3224.8
oh hey guns have never owned

3222.559 --> 3224.8
oh

3225.04 --> 3228.24
oh

3225.92 --> 3228.2400000000002
that's

3229.359 --> 3234.5989999999997
yes

3230.4 --> 3234.599
oh my god thank you

3244.319 --> 3249.2799999999997
that is such a relief

3246.4 --> 3251.52
yeah 25 euros that's

3249.28 --> 3252.88
ah that's epic that's exactly what i

3251.52 --> 3254.319
needed

3252.88 --> 3255.92
thank you

3254.319 --> 3258.96
ron again

3255.92 --> 3258.96
saving my hide

3263.2 --> 3267.04
why do i not get the super cache

3269.2 --> 3273.839
because

3270.4 --> 3276.88
well it's all funneled into the

3273.839 --> 3279.839
uh yeah the google payment system

3276.88 --> 3281.359
uh and yeah i have to pay everything

3279.839 --> 3283.04
back

3281.359 --> 3284.48
right because i'm living on social

3283.04 --> 3286.079
welfare

3284.48 --> 3287.839
i have to report it in because it's

3286.079 --> 3289.8390000000004
officially a job

3287.839 --> 3292.24
it's a job payment i have to report that

3289.839 --> 3294.4
so i don't actually get anything out of

3292.24 --> 3294.3999999999996
it

3294.799 --> 3300.48
really

3296.559 --> 3302.48
it's like two percent or something

3300.48 --> 3303.52
that's it that's all i receive from it

3302.48 --> 3306.64
so

3303.52 --> 3309.52
yeah that's why however paypal

3306.64 --> 3312.96
i can classify under

3309.52 --> 3315.04
like actual gift donations

3312.96 --> 3318.079
as long as it doesn't exceed a certain

3315.04 --> 3320.88
yearly limit which it absolutely doesn't

3318.079 --> 3324.1600000000003
so far

3320.88 --> 3326.079
and then i yeah and i just receive it

3324.16 --> 3329.359
like it's on my paypal i send it

3326.079 --> 3332.2400000000002
directly to my bank it it arrives

3329.359 --> 3335.04
roughly two days later or sometimes one

3332.24 --> 3337.2
day later right so that's direct help

3335.04 --> 3339.2799999999997
it's money i get immediately i can

3337.2 --> 3341.5989999999997
immediately use for groceries and the

3339.28 --> 3341.599
like

3342.799 --> 3349.16
don't have to report paypal

3344.88 --> 3349.1600000000003
well have to i don't

3349.359 --> 3354.72
so yeah if you want you you might be

3351.52 --> 3354.72
able to [ __ ] me over

3355.52 --> 3360.72
if you really wanted to but i don't

3358.319 --> 3362.799
i did tell my social worker i do get

3360.72 --> 3364.24
that and he said oh you might want to

3362.799 --> 3365.92
report that and i'm like no i'm not

3364.24 --> 3367.2
going to do that

3365.92 --> 3369.6800000000003
he's not going to

3367.2 --> 3372.96
spill the beans or anything

3369.68 --> 3374.0789999999997
because i like guys if i don't get that

3372.96 --> 3377.52
money

3374.079 --> 3379.92
i will literally starve to death

3377.52 --> 3384.88
like i can't get around on my social

3379.92 --> 3384.88
welfare i cannot it's not enough

3386.559 --> 3391.1600000000003
i am in a corner here

3392.4 --> 3397.6800000000003
and now if suddenly for some reason is

3395.2 --> 3400.64
never gonna happen people start like

3397.68 --> 3401.839
throwing hundred boxes at me on a daily

3400.64 --> 3403.44
basis

3401.839 --> 3405.68
yeah then it would become a different

3403.44 --> 3408.16
story then i actually get an income that

3405.68 --> 3409.5989999999997
might even like

3408.16 --> 3410.48
like

3409.599 --> 3412.88
go

3410.48 --> 3414.88
beyond what i get from my social welfare

3412.88 --> 3416.88
yeah well then i'm going to have to

3414.88 --> 3420.079
report it of course

3416.88 --> 3422.799
but until that time i'm just not going

3420.079 --> 3424.48
to do it i'm sorry i'm not doing it i

3422.799 --> 3427.52
want to eat

3424.48 --> 3428.64
i want to have kind of a very very

3427.52 --> 3430.319
modest

3428.64 --> 3433.04
living here

3430.319 --> 3435.68
and not just constantly

3433.04 --> 3438.88
die from stress because i don't have

3435.68 --> 3438.8799999999997
enough to do anything

3440.24 --> 3443.24
okay

3449.76 --> 3454.119
hey julio pebbin good to see you

3476.559 --> 3482.88
all right well yeah classical homeopath

3479.119 --> 3482.88
that's how i feel about it too

3484.4 --> 3486.96
right

3485.2 --> 3490.48
so yeah if that's going to be it well

3486.96 --> 3491.359
then i'm going to do that

3490.48 --> 3495.68
right

3491.359 --> 3495.68
i'll i'll be a grabbler in my own way

3496.319 --> 3500.799
but i'm going to be honest

3498.48 --> 3503.119
to everybody that actually gives that

3500.799 --> 3505.599
gives the money to me about it

3503.119 --> 3507.6800000000003
i'm not gonna say oh no sure i'm gonna

3505.599 --> 3510.48
no i'm not gonna lie

3507.68 --> 3514.8799999999997
but i am not going to literally

3510.48 --> 3517.04
be irrationally honest in a broken world

3514.88 --> 3519.28
in order to make my own living

3517.04 --> 3520.5589999999997
impossible yeah that's something i'm not

3519.28 --> 3521.52

i can only go by

3787.039 --> 3791.599
other people's experiences

3789.44 --> 3794.0
about my experiences

3791.599 --> 3795.3590000000004
which were non-trained when i was much

3794.0 --> 3797.119
younger

3795.359 --> 3799.44
reflecting on that

3954.48 --> 3958.0
e-bagging with success

3957.119 --> 3960.4
right

3958.0 --> 3962.839
although yeah at least i didn't do like

3960.4 --> 3965.92
half an episode about

3962.839 --> 3969.7599999999998
it i've just been talking about

3965.92 --> 3971.599
a subject that people are interested in

3969.76 --> 3974.7990000000004
i wanna

3971.599 --> 3978.319
what's his name again

3974.799 --> 3982.079
because there's another guy

3978.319 --> 3982.079
had his own logo and everything

3982.88 --> 3987.6800000000003
that was talking about astro projection

3985.68 --> 3989.359
a lot something that he still actually

3987.68 --> 3992.96
practiced

3989.359 --> 3995.359
what's his name again

3992.96 --> 3997.359
he had like this whole

3995.359 --> 3999.0389999999998
show thing going with a green screen

3997.359 --> 4002.4
he's pretty much like one of the first

3999.039 --> 4002.4
green screen guys

4003.359 --> 4007.16
it's his name again

4010.4 --> 4014.1600000000003
i think his channel is no longer there

4015.76 --> 4018.88
let me check my list

4018.96 --> 4022.799
i haven't heard from him in ages

4023.359 --> 4026.48
what's his name again

4028.559 --> 4033.48
it's on the tip of my tongue when i can

4030.48 --> 4033.48
recall

4041.28 --> 4045.3190000000004
it's also flatter than

4056.0 --> 4061.2
yes no i can't even look it up because

4059.039 --> 4064.0
i had contact with him

4061.2 --> 4068.0
on my previous skype account

4064.0 --> 4068.0
but yeah i no longer have access to that

4072.48 --> 4080.44
oh okay julio pablo no worries

4075.359 --> 4080.44
you know family comes first guys

4096.799 --> 4099.04
dude

4108.319 --> 4112.88
maybe it's even before all of you guys

4110.799 --> 4115.839
for before your time

4112.88 --> 4117.6
i haven't like streamed in

4115.839 --> 4118.48
he hasn't streamed in like over two

4117.6 --> 4120.319
years

4118.48 --> 4122.159
like he already disappeared off the

4120.319 --> 4123.6
scene even before

4122.159 --> 4128.239
the

4123.6 --> 4128.2390000000005
the sea situation started

4129.199 --> 4136.08
ah i'm just annoyed that it i almost

4132.0 --> 4136.08
know his name is just missing it

4141.679 --> 4145.679
right anyway that guy had like fully

4144.0 --> 4147.839
dedicated shows

4145.679 --> 4151.279
talking about astral projection how it

4147.839 --> 4153.759
works how it actually feels and

4151.279 --> 4156.159000000001
like what it's like

4153.759 --> 4158.319
because he he still was doing it

4156.159 --> 4160.96
like even though he's already

4158.319 --> 4164.0
like he was in his 30s already

4160.96 --> 4164.0
he's still doing it

4165.92 --> 4169.839
all right so i learned some from him as

4167.6 --> 4169.839
well

4170.799 --> 4174.96
but i myself

4172.56 --> 4177.52
i've always had an issue where i'm like

4174.96 --> 4180.0
not very good at wandering away from my

yourself

4356.8 --> 4363.04
must have been an extra nasty mood today

4359.84 --> 4366.2390000000005
maybe he realized today the price

4363.04 --> 4366.239
of his corruption

4367.04 --> 4371.199
right

4368.56 --> 4373.6
usually people that are this nasty they

4371.199 --> 4375.199
have somebody even more nasty kicking

4373.6 --> 4377.1990000000005
down on them

4375.199 --> 4380.919999999999
so when they then see that it's actually

4377.199 --> 4380.919999999999
working in some way

4384.8 --> 4387.84
for somebody else

4389.28 --> 4395.36
they get really pissed off because they

4391.92 --> 4397.52
can feel their own slavery

4395.36 --> 4399.199
that's why they're doing it

4397.52 --> 4402.080000000001
they're lashing out because they can

4399.199 --> 4403.5199999999995
feel their own change of chains of

4402.08 --> 4406.0
somebody

4403.52 --> 4408.159000000001
that cares very little about them that's

4406.0 --> 4412.08
making them do

4408.159 --> 4414.639999999999
annoying life-draining [ __ ]

4412.08 --> 4416.96
and so they're just looking for

4414.64 --> 4418.400000000001
yeah they're just gammying out they're

4416.96 --> 4420.4800000000005
like

4418.4 --> 4422.96
you can't have that

4420.48 --> 4425.28
you can't have that i'm suffering all

4422.96 --> 4428.96
this [ __ ] because your own stupid

4425.28 --> 4431.679
choices in life and your own nastiness

4428.96 --> 4433.04
and you can have that you can't just

4431.679 --> 4435.36
have

4433.04 --> 4437.6
gifts from people that

4435.36 --> 4439.679
do give it voluntarily they don't have

4437.6 --> 4442.8
to

4439.679 --> 4442.8
beg them a little maybe

4442.88 --> 4446.719
right but they do it because they like

4445.199 --> 4447.839999999999
it

4446.719 --> 4450.159
right

4447.84 --> 4452.96
because my life is better than this

4450.159 --> 4454.48
trolls guy's life it has to be

4452.96 --> 4455.679
otherwise he wouldn't be lashing out

4454.48 --> 4457.839999999999
like that

4455.679 --> 4460.64
it's just nasty

4457.84 --> 4462.88
he's he's the one that's really [ __ ]

4460.64 --> 4464.88
because he is himself

4462.88 --> 4467.36
and he is in a package

4464.88 --> 4469.12
where he needs to lash out in response

4467.36 --> 4472.239
to

4469.12 --> 4476.719
to yeah what i'm doing right here

4472.239 --> 4478.0
that means his life hurts a lot

4476.719 --> 4481.12
and i say

4478.0 --> 4484.64
yeah man it's your own damn fault

4481.12 --> 4487.36

4484.64 --> 4488.8
let's let you to that position

4487.36 --> 4489.92

4488.8 --> 4491.1990000000005
it

4489.92 --> 4493.1990000000005
you can either

4491.199 --> 4495.599999999999
to try to turn around

4493.199 --> 4497.36
lay down your gamma ways and go for the

4495.6 --> 4499.6
delta

4497.36 --> 4502.88
fix your life actually become a halfway

4499.6 --> 4504.2390000000005
decent human being or you can [ __ ]

4502.88 --> 4505.4400000000005

4595.36 --> 4598.599999999999
get out

4627.6 --> 4631.120000000001
they love doing it but not really pj

4629.92 --> 4634.0
crew shank

4631.12 --> 4634.0
they don't really

4634.48 --> 4639.28
they just like to feel that temporary

4637.28 --> 4642.159
very temporary

4639.28 --> 4644.159
like a little shocking job sensation of

4642.159 --> 4646.719
feeling a little more powerful by

4644.159 --> 4649.199
tearing somebody down

4646.719 --> 4652.2390000000005
but it's very short-lived it's a very

4649.199 --> 4652.239
petty addiction

4653.679 --> 4656.4800000000005
right

4654.48 --> 4659.04
the bigger problem is is what has led

4656.48 --> 4660.0
them to be in that position in their

4659.04 --> 4662.239
life

4660.0 --> 4665.239
to be addicted to that that's the real

4662.239 --> 4665.239
problem

4665.45 --> 4669.46
[Music]

4677.52 --> 4681.679
right so they don't really love it

4679.36 --> 4685.199
they're desperate they're desperate to

4681.679 --> 4685.1990000000005
somehow wreak havoc

4685.36 --> 4689.44
it's not working they just need to get

4687.6 --> 4692.679
the [ __ ] out

4689.44 --> 4692.678999999999
get out

4704.32 --> 4708.239
what can someone change the personal

4707.12 --> 4711.679
timeline

4708.239 --> 4714.718999999999
and does the mode and means matter i

4711.679 --> 4716.56
don't understand the question

4714.719 --> 4718.719
gaining wisdom that sounds interesting

4716.56 --> 4721.679
but i don't exactly know what you mean

4718.719 --> 4726.04
with that

4721.679 --> 4726.04

anyway

4791.199 --> 4796.259999999999
yeah gaining wisdom can you elaborate a

4793.36 --> 4799.329
little on that question

[Music]

4840.56 --> 4844.84

4848.159 --> 4853.44
doesn't actually change your timeline

4850.719 --> 4857.44
gaining wisdom i do that all the time

4853.44 --> 4857.44
it's called sizing up reality

4859.199 --> 4863.839999999999
it's what i do in my dreams a lot i test

4862.32 --> 4865.84
things i test

4863.84 --> 4868.0
energy things

4865.84 --> 4870.4800000000005
test how a person

4868.0 --> 4871.84
would respond

4870.48 --> 4874.959999999999
right so

4871.84 --> 4877.52
i've observed somebody out there

4874.96 --> 4879.52
i might have an idea about them like

4877.52 --> 4880.400000000001
that girl could potentially be really

4879.52 --> 4882.56
nice

4880.4 --> 4884.48
in some way i might want something else

4882.56 --> 4886.2390000000005
out of her then

4884.48 --> 4889.44
i basically create

4886.239 --> 4892.159
through the dream a simulacrum of her

4889.44 --> 4894.159
then i don't like some squirt boys start

4892.159 --> 4896.32
like oh let's put it in a sex don't you

4894.159 --> 4897.92
know that's something i don't do i just

4896.32 --> 4900.0
try to emulate

4897.92 --> 4901.76
right how would it be to

4900.0 --> 4903.84
get to know her

4901.76 --> 4906.88
what would she be like

4903.84 --> 4909.76
how would she respond to certain things

4906.88 --> 4912.159000000001
i have especially that part

4909.76 --> 4914.639
so i basically use the essence of an

4912.159 --> 4917.12
observation of somebody

4914.639 --> 4919.4400000000005
create a simulacrum

4917.12 --> 4921.76
in my dream

4919.44 --> 4924.4
and then test it to test

4921.76 --> 4926.400000000001
how would she respond

4924.4 --> 4927.759999999999
and what would that be like

4926.4 --> 4930.48
as into

4927.76 --> 4933.1990000000005
well yeah to simulate it

4930.48 --> 4936.159
but but really in detail actually it's

4933.199 --> 4938.159
much more detailed

4936.159 --> 4940.638999999999
than just thinking about it right

4938.159 --> 4942.719
because in your head you can do that

4940.639 --> 4944.639
but then in your head you often get

4942.719 --> 4947.679
stuck into

4944.639 --> 4949.36
less perceptive points of views that

4947.679 --> 4951.36
typically happens when you just think

4949.36 --> 4953.44
about it in the waking time

4951.36 --> 4955.839999999999
because you're influenced by

4953.44 --> 4958.799999999999
hormones and things you want

4955.84 --> 4961.12
right well in a dream can all be much

4958.8 --> 4963.4400000000005
more subtle you can actually simulate

4961.12 --> 4966.48
tender moments

4963.44 --> 4966.48
that's what i've noticed

4967.679 --> 4971.1990000000005
right

4968.8 --> 4973.6
and so in a way i am

4971.199 --> 4975.04
looking around for women and testing

4973.6 --> 4978.400000000001
them like

4975.04 --> 4978.4
do they have what it takes

4979.199 --> 4983.919999999999
because i'm looking for something big

4982.159 --> 4986.879999999999
like on the inside

4983.92 --> 4989.4400000000005
somebody that would actually be

4986.88 --> 4992.0
in a similar position to me

4989.44 --> 4994.159
yet getting around

4992.0 --> 4996.639
that would know like that would know

4994.159 --> 5000.0
about the spiritual war that's actually

4996.639 --> 5002.2390000000005
happening as we speak

5000.0 --> 5005.44
i need somebody

5002.239 --> 5008.959999999999
a girl a woman

5005.44 --> 5011.36
that has taken on that mission as well

5008.96 --> 5013.28
and that like myself is kind of looking

5011.36 --> 5016.799999999999
for a partner in it

5013.28 --> 5019.04
i thought i had found it with my ex

5016.8 --> 5022.0
and then it turned out that she

5019.04 --> 5025.28
wasn't actually that she but she knew

5022.0 --> 5029.199
that about me and she basically

5025.28 --> 5031.36
acted her way in

5029.199 --> 5033.36
and it worked really well

5031.36 --> 5035.199
and i thought like i've made it i

5033.36 --> 5037.5199999999995
finally made it and then it turned out

5035.199 --> 5040.08
that i hadn't made it at all

5037.52 --> 5043.719
and she basically fooled me into falling

5040.08 --> 5043.719
in love with her

5044.159 --> 5048.239
and then at some point she actually told

5046.159 --> 5051.5199999999995
me like oh i was actually in love with

5048.239 --> 5053.599999999999
you and i just knew like no

5051.52 --> 5055.4400000000005
you don't even know

5053.6 --> 5057.360000000001
what that's like

5055.44 --> 5060.96
you acted it all

5057.36 --> 5060.96
i know you did now

5061.199 --> 5065.839999999999
right you were vulnerable with me and i

5064.08 --> 5069.199
took care of you

5065.84 --> 5072.08
that's not the same as being in love

5069.199 --> 5075.199
she wasn't because if she had been then

5072.08 --> 5077.5199999999995
she could have never acted like that

5075.199 --> 5079.04
never ended it like that like the way

5077.52 --> 5080.719
she did

5079.04 --> 5082.08
so yeah

5080.719 --> 5084.08
that's i don't know why i brought that

5082.08 --> 5085.84
up but

5084.08 --> 5089.04
that's part of the reason why i'm so

5085.84 --> 5089.04
freaking careful now

5090.159 --> 5094.08
and why i've been single for what is it

5092.88 --> 5096.08
eight

5094.08 --> 5098.48
nine years now

5096.08 --> 5100.88
like i'm not even trying

5098.48 --> 5102.4
then sure there's some girls women out

5100.88 --> 5104.639
there that are like ooh

5102.4 --> 5106.719
that's kind of nice i'm not doing it i'm

5104.639 --> 5109.04
just not going for it i i don't want

5106.719 --> 5110.8
anymore

5109.04 --> 5112.48
because i'm looking for something very

5110.8 --> 5115.1990000000005
specific

5112.48 --> 5115.199
not a fling

5115.36 --> 5120.88
and maybe a fling at some point might

5118.56 --> 5122.96
just happen

5120.88 --> 5125.36
but i'm not gonna look for it

5122.96 --> 5127.36
if it happens it happens if some woman's

5125.36 --> 5129.839999999999
finds me absolutely irresistible and

5127.36 --> 5131.92
chooses to bump into me

5129.84 --> 5135.360000000001
then

5131.92 --> 5135.36
i might just do that

5137.28 --> 5141.04
but

5138.0 --> 5143.28
it will always turn out that actually my

5141.04 --> 5145.12
real priority is finding a

5143.28 --> 5146.239
like a sorceress

5145.12 --> 5147.679
really

5146.239 --> 5150.48
a person that's

5147.679 --> 5152.639
on a high level spiritually

5150.48 --> 5154.4
and that is aware of what's happening in

5152.639 --> 5156.32
the world and that is looking for a

5154.4 --> 5158.4
partner that's the thing i really want

5156.32 --> 5160.4
that's the thing i'm really looking for

5158.4 --> 5162.879999999999
don't know if i'll ever find it within

5160.4 --> 5165.839999999999
my lifetime

5162.88 --> 5165.84
but that's what i want

5166.239 --> 5170.159
and i want kids with that person

5174.0 --> 5179.28
and yeah safe to say they're all going

5175.92 --> 5181.4400000000005
to be have to be very much anti-vaxxers

5179.28 --> 5182.719
and willing to actually

5181.44 --> 5185.5199999999995
defend

5182.719 --> 5188.56
our children against it with

5185.52 --> 5191.360000000001
violence if necessary

5188.56 --> 5191.360000000001
great caution

5192.639 --> 5198.56
right anyway

5195.28 --> 5198.5599999999995
uh let's move on

5201.199 --> 5205.28
hello steamy traveler

5203.76 --> 5209.12
yeah steam traveler we had a bit of

5205.28 --> 5209.12
conversation yesterday on skype

5209.36 --> 5213.5199999999995
i find that as i find myself being able

5212.0 --> 5215.84
to talk

5213.52 --> 5219.88
quite directly and

5215.84 --> 5219.88
and all that with steamy traveler

5226.88 --> 5229.88
um

5249.76 --> 5253.360000000001
marriage and divorce oh that sucks pj

5252.0 --> 5255.84
crew shank

5253.36 --> 5257.839999999999
right so you had your fair share

5255.84 --> 5261.04
well i haven't even had that many

5257.84 --> 5261.04
serious relationships

5261.28 --> 5265.44
it comes to like

5262.96 --> 5267.6
serious relationships where i was like

5265.44 --> 5268.879999999999
really invested

5267.6 --> 5270.08
it's been

5268.88 --> 5272.08
two

5270.08 --> 5274.719
that's my ex and it's my third

5272.08 --> 5274.719
girlfriend

5277.04 --> 5279.6
first

5278.159 --> 5281.839999999999
the first one

5279.6 --> 5283.6
or yeah the last one

5281.84 --> 5287.04
three years

5283.6 --> 5289.52
and my third girlfriend two years

5287.04 --> 5292.159
and the rest has all kind of like

5289.52 --> 5294.639
yeah was a little bit just really

5292.159 --> 5298.0
sexually attracted or something and

5294.639 --> 5300.4800000000005
maybe even a bit emotionally in love

5298.0 --> 5302.239
and then like yeah after

5300.48 --> 5304.239
it's run its course

5302.239 --> 5306.718999999999
i just kind of lose interest

5304.239 --> 5308.638999999999
then doesn't work anymore

5306.719 --> 5310.56
i've had some of that

5308.639 --> 5312.4800000000005
i've i think i've probably broken a

5310.56 --> 5315.4400000000005
couple of hearts

5312.48 --> 5318.159
but i never really drew them in

5315.44 --> 5322.839999999999
like i never really tried to enchant

5318.159 --> 5322.839999999999
women to really fall in love with me

5322.88 --> 5326.32
although i kind of did try that with my

5325.44 --> 5328.159
ex

5326.32 --> 5332.239
a bit

5328.159 --> 5332.239
because i wanted to be with her forever

5332.56 --> 5337.1990000000005
and then you just do that

5335.52 --> 5341.0
you just want them to be like that

5337.199 --> 5341.0
towards you as well

5350.79 --> 5355.89
[Music]

5368.239 --> 5371.678999999999
if you really should never have happened

5370.32 --> 5375.12
just

5371.679 --> 5377.84
write the ones that drag on

5375.12 --> 5381.5199999999995
right well yeah i i've i've had some of

5377.84 --> 5384.0
that and yeah when i noticed that women

5381.52 --> 5386.080000000001
girls that i was with were really

5384.0 --> 5388.48
holding on even when i was giving signs

5386.08 --> 5391.04
like this is not going to work

5388.48 --> 5394.32
i just

5391.04 --> 5394.32
i don't let them hang

5394.48 --> 5398.239
i've had some of those they were

5396.239 --> 5399.919999999999
actually kind of nice women really in

5398.239 --> 5401.5199999999995
retrospect it just

5399.92 --> 5403.679
wasn't good enough for me sorry it's

5401.52 --> 5406.679
just the way it is they were not smart

5403.679 --> 5406.679
enough

5408.08 --> 5411.84
they just weren't

5409.52 --> 5411.84
and

5412.159 --> 5415.36
i just

5413.199 --> 5418.879999999999
like eventually start like getting more

5415.36 --> 5421.36
aggressive not physically but just like

5418.88 --> 5422.4800000000005
more reckless and just like no no i

5421.36 --> 5424.639
really don't

5422.48 --> 5426.48
no it's really not going to last

5424.639 --> 5428.8
i don't just let them

5426.48 --> 5430.959999999999
linger and like i'll keep going i don't

5428.8 --> 5433.04
want to confront it right

5430.96 --> 5435.84
i don't do that because

5433.04 --> 5439.5199999999995
if that point arrives it literally makes

5435.84 --> 5440.400000000001
me sick it makes me nauseated

5439.52 --> 5444.080000000001
so

5440.4 --> 5447.879999999999
then i'm just like nope

5444.08 --> 5447.88
just letting it go

5453.92 --> 5460.4
it's weird because i think that maybe in

5456.08 --> 5462.48
a way that's exactly how my ex

5460.4 --> 5464.08
experienced me

5462.48 --> 5466.718999999999
in the last period

5464.08 --> 5469.04
because i was not letting go

5466.719 --> 5471.6
i was like literally on my knees begging

5469.04 --> 5471.6
at times

5473.92 --> 5478.0
because all my dreams were invested with

5476.0 --> 5480.239
her all of it

5478.0 --> 5482.88
we were like

5480.239 --> 5484.879999999999
doing all that

5482.88 --> 5488.0
we had plans for the future even and

5484.88 --> 5490.32
building it and i just i did not want to

5488.0 --> 5492.4
let it go

5490.32 --> 5494.32
anyway

5492.4 --> 5496.799999999999
that's all in the past it's almost a

5494.32 --> 5497.599999999999
decade ago god i'm still talking about

5496.8 --> 5500.6
it

5497.6 --> 5500.6
sheesh

5510.639 --> 5514.08
i

5511.6 --> 5515.360000000001
just split up for christmas oh that

5514.08 --> 5518.6
sucks

5515.36 --> 5518.599999999999
yeah logs

5521.84 --> 5526.159000000001
is going nowhere right

5524.159 --> 5528.32
well yeah well if it just fizzles you

5526.159 --> 5531.92
know then there's really not a lot of

5528.32 --> 5533.759999999999
harm done of if on both sides it fizzles

5531.92 --> 5536.4800000000005
yeah you're just like yeah

5533.76 --> 5537.280000000001
just nah

5536.48 --> 5539.44
right

5537.28 --> 5541.679
but at least those don't really damage

5539.44 --> 5541.678999999999
you

5543.679 --> 5548.639
right you just both move on and you can

5545.679 --> 5548.639
still be friends

5549.12 --> 5552.8
or at least

5550.48 --> 5554.959999999999
it you might start out being able to do

5552.8 --> 5557.28
that right because you never really know

5554.96 --> 5559.36
where the dynamics go after you split up

5557.28 --> 5561.84
you don't know how that's gonna turn out

5559.36 --> 5561.839999999999
but

5567.6 --> 5572.96
it's weird because i kind of had that

5570.4 --> 5575.44
sort of relationship with

5572.96 --> 5577.6
who's now my friend in neymar which is

5575.44 --> 5579.919999999999
still it's like my longest lasting

5577.6 --> 5579.92
friend

5580.56 --> 5584.2390000000005
the one with the

5582.08 --> 5586.8
with the kid

5584.239 --> 5589.36
that i talk over the phone we had a very

5586.8 --> 5590.719
short relationship and we just both knew

5589.36 --> 5593.36
like yeah this is

5590.719 --> 5595.04
like we really like we were really close

5593.36 --> 5597.04
to each other but it just eventually

5595.04 --> 5599.36
started feel more like we were actually

5597.04 --> 5601.6
brother and sister or something

5599.36 --> 5602.719
like we were family

5601.6 --> 5605.6
not like

5602.719 --> 5606.719
we were like in a relationship it was

5605.6 --> 5608.8
weird

5606.719 --> 5611.36
so it yeah that just stopped

5608.8 --> 5612.88
and we didn't neither of us really had a

5611.36 --> 5615.759999999999
big problem with it

5612.88 --> 5617.76
when it eventually ended

5615.76 --> 5619.52
actually the troubles we had between

5617.76 --> 5623.360000000001
each other

5619.52 --> 5623.360000000001
ended once we figured that out

5625.52 --> 5631.120000000001
where do you think the best place is to

5627.199 --> 5632.799999999999
meet a perspective this church is

5631.12 --> 5635.44
museums

5632.8 --> 5639.1990000000005
nightclubs oh my god

5635.44 --> 5639.199

5647.84 --> 5651.96
in a on a dance floor

5660.239 --> 5664.879999999999
in a church i would just get so freaking

5666.8 --> 5671.6
like shy and [ __ ]

5669.04 --> 5673.28
unless some woman there

5671.6 --> 5675.6
that i happen to like would really find

5673.28 --> 5677.199
that cute i don't know how to really

5675.6 --> 5679.76
meet women

5677.199 --> 5679.759999999999
in church

5680.4 --> 5686.799999999999
i i don't know i haven't been there long

5682.8 --> 5688.320000000001
enough to really test it in just a year

5686.8 --> 5690.639
although there were some really cute

5688.32 --> 5693.92
girls there

5690.639 --> 5693.92
girls women sorry

5698.48 --> 5703.28
my your ex at uni hmm

5701.28 --> 5705.199
right well my first girlfriend i met in

5703.28 --> 5707.84
school she actually turned out to be in

5705.199 --> 5707.839999999999
my class

5709.679 --> 5714.88
like we'd been in the same class for

5711.679 --> 5717.6
over a year and i didn't even notice her

5714.88 --> 5717.6
it was weird

5722.96 --> 5729.84
but yeah that's a long long time ago 24

5726.48 --> 5729.839999999999
years sheesh

5739.52 --> 5743.52
you get into a relationship with a girl

5741.52 --> 5747.360000000001
if she also listens

5743.52 --> 5749.76
to jeffrey daughtry's streams okay

5747.36 --> 5749.759999999999
all right

5750.96 --> 5758.719
flat earth convention

5754.159 --> 5758.719
well an actual flat earth girl

5760.639 --> 5767.4400000000005
that would be something really new bj

5762.8 --> 5770.639
krishank like really something else

5767.44 --> 5774.08
i've never met women that were

5770.639 --> 5777.1990000000005
too many steps beyond normie

5774.08 --> 5779.36
and then i would be the one to really

5777.199 --> 5781.36
show it to them right it's like that was

5779.36 --> 5783.28
my entry is

5781.36 --> 5785.599999999999
like sharing what i know

5783.28 --> 5788.32
that's like those are the goods i have

5785.6 --> 5790.159000000001
to present even in a relationship my

5788.32 --> 5792.08
wisdom

5790.159 --> 5793.28
i was trying to do that all the time

5792.08 --> 5795.36
with my ex

5793.28 --> 5796.88
and then she was

5795.36 --> 5798.96
a dentist

5796.88 --> 5801.04
just graduated

5798.96 --> 5802.96
and i would even do it with that like

5801.04 --> 5804.639
with that profession i would help out

5802.96 --> 5806.32
and i would like help out with the

5804.639 --> 5808.400000000001
social dynamics because she was having a

5806.32 --> 5809.36
bit of trouble with like

5808.4 --> 5811.759999999999
the

5809.36 --> 5813.36
dentist she worked for and all that

5811.76 --> 5816.56
and i would help because that's

5813.36 --> 5818.639
something i'm really good at even

5816.56 --> 5821.1990000000005
even with professional things that are

5818.639 --> 5824.159000000001
outside of my personal reach i can do

5821.199 --> 5825.759999999999
that i'm really good at that

5824.159 --> 5828.96
right so it's one of the skills i have

5825.76 --> 5828.96
to offer as a boyfriend

5838.08 --> 5843.679
right but yeah i would be curious like

5840.56 --> 5846.719
what would a flatter the girl be like

5843.679 --> 5846.719
wouldn't she like be

5846.88 --> 5851.76
i don't know most women that i see

5849.92 --> 5854.719
that are into flat earth are kind of

5851.76 --> 5858.639
like a little too old for me sorry

5854.719 --> 5861.44
i do like younger women i really do

5858.639 --> 5863.6
not super super young but

5861.44 --> 5866.638999999999
i think that my most attractive range is

5863.6 --> 5869.1990000000005
around 30 right now

5866.639 --> 5871.4400000000005
like 25 30

5869.199 --> 5873.678999999999
20 30 to be fair

5871.44 --> 5875.44
depends on their character right

5873.679 --> 5878.08
but

5875.44 --> 5879.28
the really young ones i seem to

5878.08 --> 5881.04
come across

5879.28 --> 5884.48
out there on the scene

5881.04 --> 5886.639
they're all kind of aggressive

5884.48 --> 5888.638999999999
i don't really like women that are like

5886.639 --> 5890.8
that

5888.639 --> 5890.8
so

5891.28 --> 5896.159
i don't know

5892.96 --> 5900.44
i don't know about that

5896.159 --> 5900.44
do you understand what i mean though

5932.719 --> 5935.719
hmm

5942.56 --> 5944.88
hmm

5948.88 --> 5954.8
your ex was your first real boyfriend

5952.48 --> 5954.799999999999
right

5956.88 --> 5960.96
yeah it does hurt

5958.48 --> 5963.28
but it's more like nostalgia

5960.96 --> 5966.6
when that happens lydia logs thanks for

5963.28 --> 5966.599999999999
sharing that

5974.159 --> 5979.839999999999
yeah well pg crew shank not like

5977.36 --> 5981.839999999999
normies one thing but if they're like tv

5979.84 --> 5982.96
slaves i don't want to have anything to

5981.84 --> 5985.6
do with that

5982.96 --> 5987.04
i'd feel gross even having sex with that

5985.6 --> 5990.52
literally

5987.04 --> 5990.5199999999995
there's no way

5998.4 --> 6003.44
right it's like

6000.4 --> 6006.32
normies one thing but if they're like

6003.44 --> 6009.04
tv slave normie that's just way too far

6006.32 --> 6011.599999999999
for me

6009.04 --> 6012.96
because i'd end up freaking sitting next

6011.6 --> 6016.159000000001
to them

6012.96 --> 6019.199
kind of staring at tv commerce i'm not

6016.159 --> 6021.44
gonna do that i refuse i will not do

6019.199 --> 6022.719
that i will not spend the rest of my

6021.44 --> 6023.839999999999
life

6022.719 --> 6026.2390000000005
doing that

6023.84 --> 6026.2390000000005
never

6026.4 --> 6029.638999999999
no way

6042.0 --> 6048.56
wow flat off stage that's crazy sorry

6045.6 --> 6051.84
so she sees

6048.56 --> 6051.84
did she steal your car

6057.84 --> 6062.0
your ex is a hard normie

6060.239 --> 6065.36
stay away from conversation about the

6062.0 --> 6067.04
truth yeah exactly well that's very

6065.36 --> 6068.0
simple

6067.04 --> 6070.0
if

6068.0 --> 6071.84
if yeah

6070.0 --> 6074.239
we would literally have nothing to talk

6071.84 --> 6078.119000000001
about because that's the almost the only

6074.239 --> 6078.119
thing i ever think about

6078.8 --> 6084.52
so what what are you gonna end up

6080.719 --> 6084.52
talking about nothing

6100.0 --> 6105.92
wow okay flatter state shows so she

6103.679 --> 6107.52
she just used your car to basically

6105.92 --> 6109.84
cheat on you that's

6107.52 --> 6113.159000000001
that's rough man

6109.84 --> 6113.159000000001
that's rough

6133.98 --> 6137.639999999999
[Music]

dreams and even astral projection and

6204.239 --> 6208.718999999999
all the forums and now it's gone

6207.119 --> 6212.08
into rolling

6208.719 --> 6213.84
rolled into talking about relationships

6212.08 --> 6215.679
so i guess

6213.84 --> 6216.84
yeah

6215.679 --> 6220.32

6233.84 --> 6239.52
heard that saying like oh but you're not

6236.08 --> 6242.159

6242.159 --> 6246.159
of of those struggles from other people
