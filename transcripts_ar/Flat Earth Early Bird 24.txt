1.45 --> 9.588999999999999
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.27 --> 13.998999999999999
early-bird episode 24 I'm your host our

9.589 --> 17.3
twin today not starting out with guests

13.999 --> 18.28
yep but I'm expecting some to arrive

17.3 --> 21.89
soon

18.28 --> 22.67
Travis said he wants to come on so that

21.89 --> 32.39
would be nice

22.67 --> 36.32
in the meantime Travis don't worry about

32.39 --> 47.569
it I just started like a minute ago so

36.32 --> 51.079
perfect timing how are you well I am Sam

47.569 --> 53.809000000000005
I'm riding on just like fumes I've got

51.079 --> 56.629
65 hours in from work this week a news

53.809 --> 58.309
all five o'clock at night till 5:00 in

56.629 --> 66.11
the morning so my sleep schedule is all

58.309 --> 68.81
screwed up sorry I don't know if it's my

66.11 --> 70.52
computer or the sound but I'm not

68.81 --> 74.18
hearing you all too well

70.52 --> 76.61
okay test one two three yeah better

74.18 --> 79.7
better now I could hear you but just not

76.61 --> 84.65
loud enough but yeah hearing you fine

79.7 --> 88.16
now like that okay so you you're at home

84.65 --> 92.69
or getting ready to go on the road or no

88.16 --> 97.19
no I just got in from my my work tonight

92.69 --> 101.53999999999999
or last night so oh you had a night

97.19 --> 105.37
shift yeah yeah I went in it I went in

101.54 --> 109.49000000000001
at five o'clock and worked until 5:30

105.37 --> 111.5
whoa so it was yeah it's it's peak

109.49 --> 117.97999999999999
season for male so it's pretty heavy it

111.5 --> 122.32
slows everybody down oh right right the

117.98 --> 124.79
mail delivery post postal uh-huh yeah

122.32 --> 127.61
everybody suddenly starts to send cards

124.79 --> 128.74
again out of nothing because it's

127.61 --> 131.96
tradition

128.74 --> 134.77
yeah well this is also a lot of business

131.96 --> 141.41
to it's not just

134.77 --> 149.06
indeed yeah lots of things happen during

141.41 --> 152.78
Christmas season right so what do you do

149.06 --> 156.68
postal delivery as well or no I just

152.78 --> 161.0
take the large bulk to the post offices

156.68 --> 163.70000000000002
so then they distribute them and they

161.0 --> 164.42
get sent out in the smaller trucks right

163.7 --> 166.64
right right

164.42 --> 170.92999999999998
yeah you're not I didn't mean delivery

166.64 --> 173.77999999999997
but you do all postal package is

170.93 --> 177.79000000000002
basically yeah yeah like the from the

173.78 --> 177.79
collector side not from the distributor

178.57 --> 187.12
so I I can I could go get a whole load

182.84 --> 191.11
of Target supply or Target product or

187.12 --> 198.19
you know Amazon product yes

191.11 --> 203.60000000000002
but last night it was all mixed Oh

198.19 --> 205.43
plenty of work I guess that's for sure

203.6 --> 206.89
odds for sure all that there's there's

205.43 --> 211.25
tons of junk mail that goes out it's

206.89 --> 214.92999999999998
just it's crazy how much revenue there

211.25 --> 218.6
is for that stuff a lot of slike

214.93 --> 224.57
packages with bottles of wine and such

218.6 --> 230.81
as well or you know I don't I mean I

224.57 --> 234.26
don't look to see really what's in the

230.81 --> 236.44
flats that I take out so but no nothing

234.26 --> 240.709
nothing perishable as far as I know all

236.44 --> 242.32999999999998
right right right now didn't more like

240.709 --> 245.99
just wondering what would be in there

242.33 --> 248.54000000000002
and yeah I like a lot of businesses send

245.99 --> 250.37
around Christmas packages and there's

248.54 --> 255.73999999999998
usually like bottles of wine in there

250.37 --> 257.84000000000003
and so yeah that's gonna like huge

255.74 --> 259.60900000000004
companies doing that thousands of times

257.84 --> 266.15
it's gonna be a lot of packages

259.609 --> 271.28999999999996
basically being sent everywhere anyway

266.15 --> 274.40999999999997
so anything on your mind or your heart

271.29 --> 279.90000000000003
we want to talk about something talk

274.41 --> 282.45000000000005
about ah let's see I gotta do I've

279.9 --> 287.03999999999996
gotten into a quite a long thread on

282.45 --> 291.69
roux hips latest video hmm I made some

287.04 --> 295.98
comments and trolls and others are you

291.69 --> 299.7
know making follow-up comments hmm I'm

295.98 --> 302.07
basically challenging their their idea

299.7 --> 306.51
of science not in the business of

302.07 --> 308.46
proving anything and I don't I don't

306.51 --> 315.78
particularly hold that you I don't I

308.46 --> 317.64
don't buy into that that spin of science

315.78 --> 324.33
is in the business of disproving things

317.64 --> 326.82
not proving them and whatnot so I'm

324.33 --> 331.26
getting called a lot of interesting

326.82 --> 333.54
names and denier denier of science and

331.26 --> 335.84999999999997
things like that but I mean it just

333.54 --> 337.29
seems to be it just seems silly to me to

335.85 --> 339.15000000000003
make that kind of a distinction that

337.29 --> 340.91900000000004
science isn't the bit isn't in the

339.15 --> 343.02
business it's it's gonna be proving

340.919 --> 345.45
something by default if you if you

343.02 --> 349.77
disprove something than the then the

345.45 --> 352.83
opposite is proven in my opinion you

349.77 --> 355.53
can't get around establishing something

352.83 --> 357.78
it all depends on the nature of what

355.53 --> 359.72999999999996
you're dealing with sure if you're going

357.78 --> 362.94
to approach things geometrically for

359.73 --> 365.76
example then yeah one type of sign or

362.94 --> 368.88
measured element will exclude specific

365.76 --> 373.83
others due to the nature of the geometry

368.88 --> 377.12
of it for sure but with other things it

373.83 --> 379.85999999999996
can easily turn into a false dichotomy

377.12 --> 381.66
because there could be a lot of things

379.86 --> 387.59000000000003
possible some of which we don't even

381.66 --> 387.59000000000003
haven't even realized yet it all depends

387.98 --> 390.98
yeah

391.82 --> 397.8
anyway yeah good that you're you're at

394.62 --> 404.19
it although you know with the ballers

397.8 --> 408.93
we're at such a point right now it's the

404.19 --> 412.08
further we push the less real arguing is

408.93 --> 414.72
going to be done in reciprocation

412.08 --> 416.52
because we're just hooking them in there

414.72 --> 419.87
sensitives fault and they have no real

416.52 --> 423.47999999999996
defense so they will ramp up the

419.87 --> 426.72
psychological defenses in any way

423.48 --> 429.90000000000003
possible and look they're already at the

426.72 --> 431.70000000000005
point where in a regular conversation

429.9 --> 434.4
they will admit their so all are wrong

431.7 --> 437.37
with science and that there's bad habits

434.4 --> 439.34999999999997
in their presupposing things basically

437.37 --> 441.69
that turn out to be false they all admit

439.35 --> 443.79
this but when you bring it in the

441.69 --> 446.64
context of global forces Flat Earth

443.79 --> 450.20000000000005
right and they don't think with that

446.64 --> 452.88
calm reason they're completely

450.2 --> 455.61
politicized and they can't help it and

452.88 --> 457.74
they don't even see the transition

455.61 --> 462.3
anymore they just got this impulse and

457.74 --> 465.93
the impulse just rules over there their

462.3 --> 468.83
decision-making even though they feel

465.93 --> 474.57
that it is them doing it better fit

468.83 --> 480.21
right and you can't overcome it with

474.57 --> 483.9
reason if the only way to really do it

480.21 --> 487.16999999999996
is to somehow enable these people to let

483.9 --> 489.15
down their guard by not posing a threat

487.17 --> 491.85
to the thing you're literally

489.15 --> 498.27
threatening but that's extremely

491.85 --> 501.90000000000003
difficult it's like trying to fix a

498.27 --> 504.29999999999995
psychological issue with somebody who

501.9 --> 507.47999999999996
gets really triggered when you mention

504.3 --> 510.66
it how do you talk about it without

507.48 --> 514.74
triggering them it's extremely difficult

510.66 --> 516.479
very in psychology where they do things

514.74 --> 518.76
pretty systematically this is even

516.479 --> 522.599
approach is a very long-winded process

518.76 --> 524.099
and yeah you could paste in it if you

522.599 --> 526.3190000000001
really focus with

524.099 --> 528.24
one person on that other person and just

526.319 --> 531.75
invest a lot of energy yeah you could do

528.24 --> 535.05
it fast but it will always take a lot of

531.75 --> 538.889
effort because it's all about breaking

535.05 --> 542.91
through a barrier without it's like

538.889 --> 544.74
trying to dismantle bomb you've got a

542.91 --> 546.86
deal with it - deal with it but if you

544.74 --> 549.86
deal with it you risk it from exploding

546.86 --> 554.16
that's pretty much the setup and it's

549.86 --> 555.69
gonna be like that more and more and on

554.16 --> 559.639
the other hand yeah we got people like

555.69 --> 562.47
this in there who suddenly just wake up

559.639 --> 564.54
suddenly this region in them and their

562.47 --> 570.1990000000001
mind just unfolds and they don't you see

564.54 --> 574.11
like hey you can think about it without

570.199 --> 576.779
losing your mind without becoming

574.11 --> 579.149
extremely sad over the loss of some

576.779 --> 583.4399999999999
things because they already been in

579.149 --> 585.899
their mind been reasonable at least not

583.44 --> 588.509
pushed on their own emotions to keep it

585.899 --> 592.23
going and just start to look carefully

588.509 --> 594.72
and yeah that's how it works it as long

592.23 --> 597.689
as you're reasonable and you're really

594.72 --> 599.97
out for the truth and you allow doubts

597.689 --> 603.569
into study new things or things that

599.97 --> 606.4490000000001
contrast what you like and eventually

603.569 --> 608.819
yeah it will be able to settle and just

606.449 --> 610.079
give you a clear overview of what's

608.819 --> 611.37
really happening and I think that's

610.079 --> 617.25
what's happening within there and it's

611.37 --> 621.48
very very inspiring to see and to

617.25 --> 627.839
recognize because she can't fake it you

621.48 --> 631.589
can just hear it let's not get too too

627.839 --> 635.1890000000001
sticky but I was almost like gushing the

631.589 --> 637.5600000000001
way he described his experiences like oh

635.189 --> 640.769
my god you're using my lingo and it's

637.56 --> 642.9899999999999
not I can't hear in your tone that

640.769 --> 644.79
you're trying to copy me you're really

642.99 --> 649.05
thinking like that you really get it

644.79 --> 651.66
good feel it's like ah my son is growing

649.05 --> 653.939
up and it's not my son Wizards

651.66 --> 657.8
Apprentice I guess but yeah that was

653.939 --> 661.3389999999999
special and I think more people

657.8 --> 665.209
that will eventually turn around one way

661.339 --> 668.36
or the other or I think some globus may

665.209 --> 670.91
just end up admitting defeat but we'll

668.36 --> 673.49
say yeah but I'm still gonna believe

670.91 --> 674.18
it's a globe because I can and you can't

673.49 --> 679.3100000000001
stop me

674.18 --> 681.3199999999999
but yeah you win that kind of thing yeah

679.31 --> 683.63
I've got another conversation going with

681.32 --> 688.45
somebody that I've known for quite some

683.63 --> 693.1
time and then I I just I just trigger

688.45 --> 693.1
everything in him he gets he gets a

695.17 --> 702.019
phone call their problems yeah I had a

698.959 --> 705.0189999999999
phone call come in he gets he gets very

702.019 --> 710.6
triggered talking about he so we were

705.019 --> 712.85
discussing trusting our senses and when

710.6 --> 714.44
I challenged the physicality of the Sun

712.85 --> 717.74
and the moon he thinks that that's a

714.44 --> 720.2600000000001
denial of our senses he he's adamant

717.74 --> 722.6
about the fact that he knows the moon is

720.26 --> 727.0699999999999
physical because of the terrain that he

722.6 --> 729.2
can see and he he's not comfortable I

727.07 --> 731.9590000000001
think that the one thing that I've

729.2 --> 733.76
noticed about our camp is that you know

731.959 --> 735.4699999999999
we're comfortable with not only are we

733.76 --> 737.899
comfortable was saying that we don't

735.47 --> 742.4300000000001
know definitively but we're also

737.899 --> 746.42
comfortable with thinking a little bit

742.43 --> 749.329
more loosely about the moon or the Sun

746.42 --> 753.25
and he's just he's just not willing to

749.329 --> 757.37
relinquish he will not feel comfortable

753.25 --> 759.529
saying of course you want it is very

757.37 --> 764.449
uncomfortable because it reaches into a

759.529 --> 767.0889999999999
very foundational way of thinking

764.449 --> 769.16
programming it is he thinks it's an

767.089 --> 772.2790000000001
attack on the senses because that's the

769.16 --> 775.3
region where he feels the conflict but

772.279 --> 779.209
what he doesn't realize is it's sensory

775.3 --> 782.51
programming people at a young age when

779.209 --> 785.9899999999999
they awaken have been taught to think in

782.51 --> 790.029
that structure type and that's why

785.99 --> 791.72
you'll more easily accept and hold on to

790.029 --> 795.47
physicality assumption

791.72 --> 797.6890000000001
is basically so it's the sensory Pro

795.47 --> 801.0500000000001
it's not the senses it's the sensory

797.689 --> 805.73
programming what what you are taught in

801.05 --> 807.5
how to interpret your senses that's what

805.73 --> 813.519
we touch upon with that it's very

807.5 --> 819.519
sensitive and it's not it's unusual to

813.519 --> 819.519
question that depth easily of things

819.879 --> 827.54
rare people rarely do that so it's like

823.97 --> 828.98
yeah every time like flat earth is one

827.54 --> 831.4699999999999
thing you bring a flat earth you get

828.98 --> 833.3000000000001
typical responses so that's obvious

831.47 --> 835.4300000000001
because of the programming the specific

833.3 --> 837.8599999999999
programming but if I bring up things

835.43 --> 839.9899999999999
like yeah these some is just a

837.86 --> 843.259
holographic light and there's day lights

839.99 --> 844.97
that hits us but yeah we don't

843.259 --> 847.04
understand really where it's coming from

844.97 --> 853.0690000000001
my theories about it they just look at

847.04 --> 854.509
me like wait and they just try to

853.069 --> 857.4799999999999
imagine what I'm saying and just

854.509 --> 860.24
everything switches into a totally new

857.48 --> 862.0690000000001
way of looking and they sometimes can

860.24 --> 863.9300000000001
get it in or sometimes it's just like

862.069 --> 866.4799999999999
what is this

863.93 --> 869.149
I don't you're talking another language

866.48 --> 874.0690000000001
I don't get this they get really like

869.149 --> 878.54
anxious about it yeah because it is in

874.069 --> 881.12
that deep sensory program it's suddenly

878.54 --> 883.819
looking like a totally new way at things

881.12 --> 886.55
and just people are not prepared for to

883.819 --> 891.3789999999999
do that they're so used to that standard

886.55 --> 898.04
approach even more than flat earth

891.379 --> 901.129
versus cloak yeah anyway sorry for

898.04 --> 902.629
rambling on yeah so I just got a I just

901.129 --> 910.279
got a notification I was labeled a

902.629 --> 912.49
serial [ __ ] yeah somebody in that

910.279 --> 912.49
thread

1162.29 --> 1170.37
one time yet the quality is really

1165.45 --> 1172.41
really bad or you can take a decent

1170.37 --> 1176.01
photograph off yourself and just use

1172.41 --> 1179.0700000000002
that as your icon yeah I could too

1176.01 --> 1182.82
well maybe one day um you know what I

1179.07 --> 1185.7
find funny some some club offers here

1182.82 --> 1189.48
those trolls they spend more time on the

1185.7 --> 1193.44
Flat Earth than I did they just chill

1189.48 --> 1198.66
here all day long watching from other

1193.44 --> 1201.51
streams and only anything to do else I

1198.66 --> 1203.43
mean they're obsessed they've lost it

1201.51 --> 1206.61
and they're obscene negatively obsessed

1203.43 --> 1209.19
with the subject all they want is to go

1206.61 --> 1211.08
away so they can move on but I don't

1209.19 --> 1213.18
wanna that's a cover for not actually

1211.08 --> 1215.51
being able to move on it's just their

1213.18 --> 1221.5800000000002
escapism

1215.51 --> 1223.89
they're either mentally ill and deranged

1221.58 --> 1227.8799999999999
that their religion being challenged and

1223.89 --> 1235.95
its mission in life or they're being

1227.88 --> 1237.8100000000002
paid no person would I mean there's a

1235.95 --> 1240.0900000000001
lot of things that people think out

1237.81 --> 1242.6399999999999
there in the world that I don't spend

1240.09 --> 1245.6999999999998
all my time trying to call them dumb and

1242.64 --> 1249.75
you know like what would you do that

1245.7 --> 1253.41
there's no logical yeah there is

1249.75 --> 1256.76
yeah it's called a need it's ego related

1253.41 --> 1261.0900000000001
people in their real face-to-face life

1256.76 --> 1263.82
usually don't have a lot of capability

1261.09 --> 1265.62
to express themselves their inner

1263.82 --> 1267.6299999999999
feelings without getting into huge

1265.62 --> 1269.6699999999998
trouble and getting smacked in the face

1267.63 --> 1271.95
or getting fired that kind of [ __ ]

1269.67 --> 1274.44
getting in a fight with their lives but

1271.95 --> 1277.23
on the internet you can be a complete

1274.44 --> 1279.69
beast especially if you're anonymous you

1277.23 --> 1281.73
can just walk away I think it's the time

1279.69 --> 1289.8
they invest like was talking mostly

1281.73 --> 1291.78
about it's not the attitude well they

1289.8 --> 1293.84
have a lot of time to waste a lot of

1291.78 --> 1298.5
people have a lot of time to waste

1293.84 --> 1300.6
because they don't have a coherent goal

1298.5 --> 1303.06
in their life that requires them to

1300.6 --> 1305.28
invest a lot of time and attention into

1303.06 --> 1307.94
that the growing process and in

1305.28 --> 1311.029
developing skills so that just

1307.94 --> 1313.909
hanging around goofing off all day long

1311.029 --> 1316.339
and some people do this in getting the

1313.909 --> 1320.449
games and these people like to do it

1316.339 --> 1322.9089999999999
more socially interactive [ __ ] around

1320.449 --> 1326.049
with Flat Earth all day long yeah I

1322.909 --> 1328.699
guess to be a troll if your gaming

1326.049 --> 1330.829
simultaneously kind of like Mr P Mars or

1328.699 --> 1336.039
something whatever he does he control

1330.829 --> 1339.1689999999999
and kind of multitask with his I know

1336.039 --> 1342.709
the guy must never go outside like he

1339.169 --> 1344.929
just I don't know or dependent depending

1342.709 --> 1347.6290000000001
on where he live he might now be afraid

1344.929 --> 1350.779
to do so because people have recognized

1347.629 --> 1356.059
him from his fail it'll mood of the

1350.779 --> 1358.279
n-words free so it's like okay I just

1356.059 --> 1359.719
order everything from internet now and

1358.279 --> 1363.489
then that's going outside anymore

1359.719 --> 1365.809
because it's dangerous that would be

1363.489 --> 1368.719
that would be kind of funny that were

1365.809 --> 1374.9289999999999
the situation poor Pete Mars funny and

1368.719 --> 1376.969
sad yeah he is that reckless so I mean

1374.929 --> 1378.979
there are ways to use these certain

1376.969 --> 1382.699
words like in context but the way he

1378.979 --> 1386.709
does it it's just literal like thickness

1382.699 --> 1386.709
you know it's almost like Tourette's

1387.579 --> 1391.999
somebody is saying it because it's

1389.629 --> 1394.7289999999998
forbidden and by the way that is also

1391.999 --> 1398.779
the instinctive impulse in Tourette's

1394.729 --> 1402.529
actually that drives you yeah forces you

1398.779 --> 1404.799
to use words that are specific you very

1402.529 --> 1408.919
much realize you're not supposed to use

1404.799 --> 1410.869
like sometimes Tourette's can even that

1408.919 --> 1412.249
it's usually a standard cycle of the

1410.869 --> 1413.749
same type of word and they don't

1412.249 --> 1416.089
interact with a lot of new people if

1413.749 --> 1417.799
they would and it would rise they would

1416.089 --> 1421.309
typically say something that they would

1417.799 --> 1427.969
feel would insult the most in in the

1421.309 --> 1433.699
circle because you have to it's really

1427.969 --> 1435.799
funny and sad hmm so they never use

1433.699 --> 1442.479
standard curse it's always something

1435.799 --> 1442.479
disgusting you know you ever notice that

1443.019 --> 1450.529
yeah I guess it's it's a weird complex

1448.279 --> 1452.149
I've only ever seen it on TV I've never

1450.529 --> 1457.69
experienced anybody and look real-life

1452.149 --> 1461.6589999999999
with Tourette's I have I met some as

1457.69 --> 1464.3890000000001
really just is it like is it like just

1461.659 --> 1466.3700000000001
like normal humans really the only thing

1464.389 --> 1468.4089999999999
is that like normal humans when they are

1466.37 --> 1471.2299999999998
getting stressed out they will find in

1468.409 --> 1473.1200000000001
between there talking ways to express it

1471.23 --> 1474.83
so they'll be complaining and yet those

1473.12 --> 1477.86
stupid government stupid this type of

1474.83 --> 1479.99
person and the Tourette's and don't have

1477.86 --> 1482.6899999999998
control over how to delegate that

1479.99 --> 1484.85
process so it'll just break in and just

1482.69 --> 1489.909
hold it out that's basically what's

1484.85 --> 1496.009
happening they can delegate that process

1489.909 --> 1497.8090000000002
it's weird it just breaks them so don't

1496.009 --> 1500.809
stress them out Audrey start doing that

1497.809 --> 1520.7
a lot and they get stressed out from

1500.809 --> 1523.549
doing it as well so no no absolutely you

1520.7 --> 1525.8600000000001
know real influence the only difference

1523.549 --> 1529.22
is is that there there don't have typing

1525.86 --> 1531.2589999999998
Tourette's it's purely a verbal impulse

1529.22 --> 1533.929
so they can evade their Tourette's

1531.259 --> 1537.409
easily in that sense it's very useful

1533.929 --> 1539.3300000000002
but the internet doesn't stimulate that

1537.409 --> 1542.96
what it does stimulate however is

1539.33 --> 1545.059
neurotic behavior in general but that's

1542.96 --> 1548.539
not what Tourette's is it's not it's

1545.059 --> 1550.61
more it's not a habit that you can let

1548.539 --> 1553.669
up it's really an impulse that you just

1550.61 --> 1556.519
don't have control of you never had you

1553.669 --> 1561.44
have to really learn through it a

1556.519 --> 1564.11
difficult outside approach of it

1561.44 --> 1568.21
basically and really gain control of it

1564.11 --> 1571.269
it's not the same as neurotic behavior

1568.21 --> 1575.83
but yeah the internet definitely

1571.269 --> 1575.83
stimulates neurotic behavior

1584.29 --> 1589.559
[Music]

1586.59 --> 1592.1789999999999
sort of a note saying like I find that

1589.559 --> 1593.769
if I'm watching the the chat in the

1592.179 --> 1595.419
YouTube that's just like a totally

1593.769 --> 1597.309
different experience and it just gets

1595.419 --> 1598.8990000000001
more even I just feel like myself

1597.309 --> 1601.6299999999999
getting neurotic where it's something

1598.899 --> 1603.6399999999999
like this it's just I guess it's the

1601.63 --> 1606.13
next best thing to actually being with

1603.64 --> 1608.289
somebody at all especially for those of

1606.13 --> 1610.1200000000001
us that what our face like I'm not doing

1608.289 --> 1612.309
it right now right I do you know what I

1610.12 --> 1613.4189999999999
mean and I cannot do other things like

1612.309 --> 1616.539
right now I'm just kind of straightening

1613.419 --> 1620.2
up my kitchen so I'm not you know zoomed

1616.539 --> 1624.1299999999999
in on the computer and the chat so right

1620.2 --> 1626.529
all right you know reading something is

1624.13 --> 1629.3500000000001
a very different and writing is a

1626.529 --> 1632.769
different level from actually seeing or

1629.35 --> 1636.519
hearing the other person and directly

1632.769 --> 1638.6200000000001
interacting when you can read the face

1636.519 --> 1642.159
language or just hear the way they speak

1638.62 --> 1644.049
it so much more depth so you then

1642.159 --> 1648.0390000000002
automatically fall back to a more

1644.049 --> 1649.33
complete sensible approach because

1648.039 --> 1652.87
otherwise you're just going to be

1649.33 --> 1654.58
awkward or antisocial and you don't

1652.87 --> 1656.529
that's not a pleasant experience for

1654.58 --> 1659.6789999999999
most I'll admit when I when I get into

1656.529 --> 1662.649
the side shed whatever we want to call

1659.679 --> 1664.8990000000001
the video chat I do the rage beast I

1662.649 --> 1667.299
just curse people mm-hmm

1664.899 --> 1669.1299999999999
it's like two different personas because

1667.299 --> 1672.25
that's what the text is it's just so

1669.13 --> 1675.429
it's just text it's so it's easy yeah

1672.25 --> 1679.029
exactly and it's not the same as

1675.429 --> 1681.94
actually speaking it out that has an old

1679.029 --> 1684.73
mother wait you actually verbally speak

1681.94 --> 1686.429
it out especially with anger or

1684.73 --> 1688.929
something that's so much more than

1686.429 --> 1691.1200000000001
nothing and it's even different from

1688.929 --> 1693.76
writing like say an essay or a blog or

1691.12 --> 1695.649
just you know even a short new a short

1693.76 --> 1698.889
piece it's very difficult like how many

1695.649 --> 1703.4499999999998
characters do you get in 200 or

1698.889 --> 1705.6799999999998
something and the YouTube app think what

1703.45 --> 1709.46
admitted to 200 characters or something

1705.68 --> 1711.44
oh yeah in one message it's a lot of

1709.46 --> 1714.1100000000001
characteristic yeah so it's even

1711.44 --> 1717.01
different from normal writing it's just

1714.11 --> 1720.1699999999998
you know fu you piece of crap done s

1717.01 --> 1722.3
well well that does fit easily but you

1720.17 --> 1725.18
can't look I've been specializing in

1722.3 --> 1729.32
basically making concise statements that

1725.18 --> 1731.45
fit within 200 letters got it gotten

1729.32 --> 1733.76
better at it usually first it would

1731.45 --> 1737.9
start out splitting it up but you can

1733.76 --> 1740.9
put a lot of data in it you just don't

1737.9 --> 1743.15
do it super super super elaborately

1740.9 --> 1745.5800000000002
because that is not gonna fit you don't

1743.15 --> 1747.8000000000002
always need to do that so yeah I have no

1745.58 --> 1750.77
problem the chat system it's good 200

1747.8 --> 1752.6299999999999
characters is good if they would shorten

1750.77 --> 1755.08
it to a hundred that would be very

1752.63 --> 1760.0100000000002
problematic because then you can barely

1755.08 --> 1762.56
put out a complex sentence anymore so I

1760.01 --> 1765.67
never got into the whole Twitter thing

1762.56 --> 1768.6799999999998
it was just like okay so it's too small

1765.67 --> 1771.3500000000001
yeah just like Facebook was dumb enough

1768.68 --> 1773.15
the whole idea of Facebook and then you

1771.35 --> 1782.11
even make it more DOM and just oh I uh

1773.15 --> 1786.1100000000001
orange man bad it's the total NPC it's

1782.11 --> 1788.57
the only way to really get across to

1786.11 --> 1791.3899999999999
draw attention is to be really Mimi so

1788.57 --> 1797.99
it's become more meme dependent because

1791.39 --> 1802.16
of the shortness of the message yeah I

1797.99 --> 1805.19
don't think it's been good for the human

1802.16 --> 1806.68
mind overall it's just part of the

1805.19 --> 1811.4
things that have dumbed people down

1806.68 --> 1813.5600000000002
massively I don't know I think that

1811.4 --> 1817.1000000000001
Twitter is kind of like a bulletin board

1813.56 --> 1819.98
and look like with all things all

1817.1 --> 1822.05
mediums all communication mediums yeah

1819.98 --> 1827.72
if you start to obsess over it or use it

1822.05 --> 1830.8999999999999
as an escapist thing hobby to evade your

1827.72 --> 1833.33
weaknesses in actual society then yeah

1830.9 --> 1835.94
you're gonna turn into a an annoying

1833.33 --> 1838.77
nerd that's just nitpicky or whatever

1835.94 --> 1842.76
just constantly on that [ __ ]

1838.77 --> 1845.8799999999999
that's annoying but yeah that's gonna

1842.76 --> 1848.16
happen with pretty much any medium you

1845.88 --> 1851.0100000000002
know people like that on Facebook people

1848.16 --> 1853.0800000000002
people like that I'm all the under all

1851.01 --> 1859.25
the other platforms and so many out

1853.08 --> 1859.25
there so it's not specifically Twitter

1859.86 --> 1865.6499999999999
[Music]

1862.5 --> 1872.09
but yeah the shorter the message you can

1865.65 --> 1875.8500000000001
post the harder it becomes to output

1872.09 --> 1878.6699999999998
complex intellectual messages that is

1875.85 --> 1884.27
just a fact so it will lower the average

1878.67 --> 1886.95
a little which is a commercially

1884.27 --> 1891.9
convenient because that's the biggest

1886.95 --> 1894.6000000000001
audience but yeah it'll it will not be a

1891.9 --> 1897.0590000000002
good platform to educate people it's

1894.6 --> 1900.6
really like a bulletin board like shouty

1897.059 --> 1902.85
like oh look at this all these people

1900.6 --> 1904.02
holding up signs with a couple of

1902.85 --> 1912.27
sentences on it

1904.02 --> 1916.5
that's twitter yeah I mean I guess just

1912.27 --> 1919.86
for me it doesn't suit my just not for

1916.5 --> 1922.59
me I don't know angry me me neither

1919.86 --> 1926.6999999999998
I did try it some time but just didn't

1922.59 --> 1929.34
feel like yeah I could be saying things

1926.7 --> 1932.059
making statements shorts just sort of

1929.34 --> 1935.52
like nothing it's a waste of time

1932.059 --> 1938.37
I'm sorry Twitter like if I'd have a

1935.52 --> 1941.49
like a real corporation or a company or

1938.37 --> 1944.04
a big plan that really requires

1941.49 --> 1950.94
widespread attention I would probably

1944.04 --> 1952.44
use Twitter but for a more you say yeah

1950.94 --> 1956.28
like the Flat Earth platform and

1952.44 --> 1958.77
communicating socializing having complex

1956.28 --> 1960.84
conversation it's just either you could

1958.77 --> 1963.78
use it as a bulletin board like hey go

1960.84 --> 1965.8799999999999
to youtube and yeah that's pretty much

1963.78 --> 1969.059
it because you can't do anything with it

1965.88 --> 1970.8990000000001
other than just points you know

1969.059 --> 1973.119
sometimes I don't know

1970.899 --> 1975.7289999999998
leaving my Facebook and all the social

1973.119 --> 1977.559
media stuff because it's just not you

1975.729 --> 1980.559
too but like Facebook Twitter all this

1977.559 --> 1982.809
crap I think wow you know if I'm if I'm

1980.559 --> 1984.549
ever doing what I do like marketing back

1982.809 --> 1986.529
again it's like that's what it's really

1984.549 --> 1992.739
designed it's just marketing it's just

1986.529 --> 1995.019
the new media it's just yeah right well

1992.739 --> 1998.679
Facebook is a very wide good platform

1995.019 --> 2002.089
the problem is it was designed to be

1998.679 --> 2005.969
corrupted as it has been politically

2002.089 --> 2009.599
corrupted so it's just me so much

2005.969 --> 2014.669
problems but it's yeah it had superior

2009.599 --> 2016.95
potential yeah yeah stop using it 2011

2014.669 --> 2023.46
because I just didn't have any interest

2016.95 --> 2027.269
in it anymore I always avoided the most

2023.46 --> 2029.909
people just post like the bright side of

2027.269 --> 2033.119
their life and people get depressed

2029.909 --> 2037.44
because they don't have such a nice life

2033.119 --> 2041.099
as the other person who actually just

2037.44 --> 2043.6190000000001
makes it look better right so I think

2041.099 --> 2045.389
Facebook in general never really

2043.619 --> 2047.9689999999998
interested me too much I never put a

2045.389 --> 2051.029
real picture of me inside Facebook

2047.969 --> 2059.309
anyway just use it a little bit as a

2051.029 --> 2061.649
joke then I lost interest in it no I

2059.309 --> 2065.01
don't think there's any real picture of

2061.649 --> 2069.359
me in Facebook maybe if some friends

2065.01 --> 2074.579
posted one of me some point and tagged

2069.359 --> 2077.129
my name then probably but yeah never

2074.579 --> 2079.3790000000004
posted by myself hilarious that's not

2077.129 --> 2080.819
even gonna happen with me because a lot

2079.379 --> 2083.129
of people in the Netherlands have

2080.819 --> 2087.5099999999998
Facebook like almost everyone that I

2083.129 --> 2089.909
know almost everyone yeah so it'd have

2087.51 --> 2095.029
been a big confrontation at first but I

2089.909 --> 2098.73
always like refused refused refused and

2095.029 --> 2103.41
ya know I'm on YouTube but everybody has

2098.73 --> 2107.099
it and it is really nobody really thinks

2103.41 --> 2109.049
about it it's just a another way of

2107.099 --> 2111.48
socially connecting for so many people

2109.049 --> 2113.609
here well I don't think instead of

2111.48 --> 2115.17
calling their networks on the phone they

2113.609 --> 2119.2799999999997
have the Facebook or they have their

2115.17 --> 2122.339
their snapchat circle that kind of thing

2119.28 --> 2122.3390000000004
[Music]

2126.289 --> 2134.579
it's some very basic chat room system

2132.39 --> 2137.819
where you can be where you can basically

2134.579 --> 2140.94
invite people and works on phones and

2137.819 --> 2143.69
it's just like a message board program

2140.94 --> 2147.2400000000002
and it's really popular here everywhere

2143.69 --> 2148.9500000000003
it's completely separate so it's not

2147.24 --> 2152.7599999999998
like Facebook or anything but a lot of

2148.95 --> 2159.8089999999997
people use that everybody just always on

2152.76 --> 2164.2200000000003
their phones do you think companies have

2159.809 --> 2169.23
an algorithm that can hear what you say

2164.22 --> 2180.5389999999998
and then put right publicity for you on

2169.23 --> 2184.17
the screen I was I was kind of surprised

2180.539 --> 2186.8390000000004
because I am at a friend's and she told

2184.17 --> 2189.569
me about her new car and we talked like

2186.839 --> 2191.88
half an hour about it and usually I

2189.569 --> 2195.839
don't I don't really give a [ __ ] about

2191.88 --> 2198.42
cars sorry usually I don't get the

2195.839 --> 2201.869
publicity of those and after we talked

2198.42 --> 2204.119
about it I watched I opened my phone and

2201.869 --> 2206.279
I went to Google and the first thing

2204.119 --> 2212.25
that publicity about cars and it was

2206.279 --> 2216.21
really a network of things and Google is

2212.25 --> 2218.609
played all into it so everything if

2216.21 --> 2222.079
there is an electronic device that's

2218.609 --> 2224.94
like built after the year 2000 roughly

2222.079 --> 2228.869
it's going to be part of this network

2224.94 --> 2233.059
and there is basically just listen

2228.869 --> 2235.98
devices in everything and they can be

2233.059 --> 2238.6800000000003
like recycled and then the data

2235.98 --> 2241.47
extracted like metadata extraction for

2238.68 --> 2243.749
that process or there can be interactive

2241.47 --> 2247.049
connections through program that through

2243.749 --> 2250.0789999999997
your computer through Wi-Fi devices just

2247.049 --> 2254.099
tap into the network of things and get

2250.079 --> 2256.849
the data can go very far

2254.099 --> 2260.1600000000003
Google usually doesn't even need to do

2256.849 --> 2263.9700000000003
like extreme other files like through

2260.16 --> 2266.759
your washing machine or anything but it

2263.97 --> 2269.819
is basically available and open for

2266.759 --> 2272.279
networking so there are programs or like

2269.819 --> 2275.579
mobile phone apps they'll just do that

2272.279 --> 2280.619
and you agree to it without looking at

2275.579 --> 2284.009
that little detail honestly I I have no

2280.619 --> 2288.359
problem in companies having where theta

2284.009 --> 2293.249
yet the problem only comes up if you

2288.359 --> 2295.769
become a person of interest then it can

2293.249 --> 2299.16
be dangerous having so much data of you

2295.769 --> 2300.45
because people can get access to it and

2299.16 --> 2304.0789999999997
use it against you

2300.45 --> 2315.6299999999997
you know that's why I've been extremely

2304.079 --> 2317.46
careful in my public what I do they just

2315.63 --> 2319.92
they want to get everybody and you know

2317.46 --> 2323.759
awaken I can't believe I mean I like

2319.92 --> 2325.829
Nami but he pushes this idea that the

2323.759 --> 2328.589
government the state never kills anybody

2325.829 --> 2331.549
really like nobody ever dies in wars I

2328.589 --> 2335.0589999999997
mean we all know these things are staged

2331.549 --> 2338.16
right al nami Nam who goes into these

2335.059 --> 2340.92
downward nihilist spirals where and

2338.16 --> 2345.8999999999996
anything that life potentially be real

2340.92 --> 2348.66
will always be fake yet he's he has very

2345.9 --> 2351.359
bizarre conspiracy theories that stretch

2348.66 --> 2355.47
extremely far that he adamantly believes

2351.359 --> 2357.96
despite their nature being so wild it's

2355.47 --> 2361.1189999999997
just extremely unlikely and he has a lot

2357.96 --> 2362.829
of these theories so like

2361.119 --> 2366.369
I'm with them that a lot of this stuff

2362.829 --> 2368.799
is fake a lot of world war two you know

2366.369 --> 2373.089
especially the big battles were yeah

2368.799 --> 2374.74
maybe not what they were what told as in

2373.089 --> 2377.92
the movies and what but that's not how

2374.74 --> 2382.0589999999997
he sees it he thinks it didn't happen at

2377.92 --> 2384.369
all nothing happened yeah exactly and he

2382.059 --> 2386.2000000000003
always thinks that well listen I said

2384.369 --> 2389.17
look at budget if it's true so I mean

2386.2 --> 2391.18
come on dummy I bet he refuses I say we

2389.17 --> 2393.339
all know that I mean especially if you

2391.18 --> 2395.339
look at the u.s. right with how violent

2393.339 --> 2397.749
the police are in our prison population

2395.339 --> 2400.839
and you know throwing people in a cage

2397.749 --> 2402.279
for no really good reason so they're

2400.839 --> 2404.88
willing to do that but they draw the

2402.279 --> 2408.19
line at killing a few thousand people

2404.88 --> 2410.799
and in an attack a staged attack really

2408.19 --> 2411.309
why you'd have to see you have to answer

2410.799 --> 2413.65
that

2411.309 --> 2416.8590000000004
like they torture people throw them in

2413.65 --> 2420.579
cages but they won't kill them makes no

2416.859 --> 2425.3489999999997
sense whatsoever it's me what do you

2420.579 --> 2426.3390000000004
mean like we got somebody liking on me

2425.349 --> 2427.63
and I don't want to pick on dummy

2426.339 --> 2429.519
because there's other people that kind

2427.63 --> 2431.2000000000003
of go this way but you know that yeah

2429.519 --> 2433.3289999999997
all the wars are fake nobody really ever

2431.2 --> 2437.6189999999997
dies it's all hologram whatever their

2433.329 --> 2440.92
their logic but I asked them like okay

2437.619 --> 2443.259
so the government throws people in cages

2440.92 --> 2446.6800000000003
for having a plan Tasers you know shoots

2443.259 --> 2450.4
people it's like why would why would

2446.68 --> 2452.2
they not kill people in a false flag or

2450.4 --> 2455.579
you know some kind of battle like it

2452.2 --> 2455.5789999999997
just doesn't make sense that they know

2455.609 --> 2461.529
don't know but look there's different

2458.95 --> 2464.589
types of felt the problem is it's over

2461.529 --> 2468.67
generalization as usual and look a

2464.589 --> 2470.769
staged events can be a lot of things up

2468.67 --> 2473.109
until a lot of levels you have stage

2470.769 --> 2475.269
defense where basically almost everyone

2473.109 --> 2478.3289999999997
is involved or where it's portrayed like

2475.269 --> 2481.93
oh this is like a stunt and then later

2478.329 --> 2483.9990000000003
it turns out that it's like yeah it's it

2481.93 --> 2485.2889999999998
was kind of fun to do but then you

2483.999 --> 2487.1189999999997
realize because you see it on the news

2485.289 --> 2488.65
like oh there was a real terror attack

2487.119 --> 2492.19
and you turned out to be part of it and

2488.65 --> 2494.7400000000002
it's like okay this is weird interesting

2492.19 --> 2497.14
I might brag about this or something

2494.74 --> 2499.99
just go with the story like the the

2497.14 --> 2502.8689999999997
Manchester thing that was like the most

2499.99 --> 2505.4799999999996
false off flat you can gets like this

2502.869 --> 2507.6400000000003
total fake event everything and so many

2505.48 --> 2509.59
people are in it really silly crisis

2507.64 --> 2512.98
actors that are just embarrassed you

2509.59 --> 2517.119
know and then you get a false flag like

2512.98 --> 2518.65
for example the hospital shooting which

2517.119 --> 2521.77
I also think is a false fact it's

2518.65 --> 2526.78
completely hold on let me finish hold on

2521.77 --> 2530.32
because the public was not aware of this

2526.78 --> 2532.3300000000004
they it was an act and nobody was

2530.32 --> 2534.4300000000003
informed and it was deemed safe enough

2532.33 --> 2537.7
they had a police that was obviously in

2534.43 --> 2540.79
on it so nobody would jump towards it

2537.7 --> 2543.49
with a gun and just shoot this actor so

2540.79 --> 2545.59
the people around it believe it is real

2543.49 --> 2548.47
and they witnessed what they thought was

2545.59 --> 2551.32
real violence that's another type of

2548.47 --> 2552.79
false flag so the actors were in on it

2551.32 --> 2554.65
they probably all survived and

2552.79 --> 2557.04
everything or weren't really wounded but

2554.65 --> 2559.9
it was believable and it was scary

2557.04 --> 2563.5
that's another type of false flag where

2559.9 --> 2565.7200000000003
not everybody is included know I think

2563.5 --> 2567.58
my point is I'm not talking about the

2565.72 --> 2569.2599999999998
different kinds of false flag but put

2567.58 --> 2571.48
put the idea of a false flag everybody

2569.26 --> 2574.3300000000004
here knows that a lot of [ __ ] is fake

2571.48 --> 2576.4900000000002
okay whatever to what level what degree

2574.33 --> 2578.43
how they did it put that aside what I'm

2576.49 --> 2583.39
saying is if you if you go down this

2578.43 --> 2584.56
this Avenue of oh it's all fake it's all

2583.39 --> 2586.6
fake none of its real

2584.56 --> 2588.46
nobody ever died you know the government

2586.6 --> 2591.88
nobody ever gets killed in these these

2588.46 --> 2594.19
wars these attacks nobody ever dies it

2591.88 --> 2596.65
just doesn't make sense because we can

2594.19 --> 2599.14
see bootable the government can be just

2596.65 --> 2601.21
by you know like like I said locking

2599.14 --> 2605.3199999999997
people in a cage for having a plant and

2601.21 --> 2605.98
tasering them in the street so it's

2605.32 --> 2608.8590000000004
nonsense

2605.98 --> 2612.22
people do die they people do die they

2608.859 --> 2614.3199999999997
just die for something it was told to

2612.22 --> 2616.8399999999997
them and it's not really that what's

2614.32 --> 2619.4100000000003
going on but they still die it's just

2616.84 --> 2625.9
not for the reason they were told

2619.41 --> 2627.3399999999997
they're being used a lot of times like

2625.9 --> 2629.02
in wars

2627.34 --> 2631.03
I think you can go a little too extreme

2629.02 --> 2636.16
with this whole everything is a fake

2631.03 --> 2636.8500000000004
staged event and no worries never

2636.16 --> 2639.96
happened

2636.85 --> 2641.2
it's a celeb solipsistic

2639.96 --> 2644.65
overgeneralization

2641.2 --> 2647.95
i mean it's basically a weakness of the

2644.65 --> 2651.4900000000002
mind to allow yourself to over simplify

2647.95 --> 2653.62
things because actually looking at the

2651.49 --> 2655.2599999999998
big picture is more it requires more

2653.62 --> 2661.0899999999997
energy requires more characters

2655.26 --> 2663.8500000000004
stabilization I mean how difficult is it

2661.09 --> 2667.6000000000004
to fake every war I think it is

2663.85 --> 2670.15
impossible because you can of course can

2667.6 --> 2673.96
fake the motives and so but the deaths

2670.15 --> 2677.29
the people who actually die it they have

2673.96 --> 2679.9
their family and everything and then you

2677.29 --> 2683.2599999999998
have to pay the people who act like they

2679.9 --> 2687.28
lost someone and of course you can fake

2683.26 --> 2688.0
it to a certain dimension yet a whole

2687.28 --> 2690.25
war

2688.0 --> 2693.46
it is impossible yeah and how about the

2690.25 --> 2695.29
journalism like back then the journalism

2693.46 --> 2698.43
wasn't as controllers now and there were

2695.29 --> 2702.22
were journalists that would reveal

2698.43 --> 2704.9199999999996
really shameful influential things that

2702.22 --> 2707.7999999999997
happened and would get people into big

2704.92 --> 2710.23
trouble that's also a sign it's not fake

2707.8 --> 2714.04
because there's real [ __ ] happening it's

2710.23 --> 2717.27
having consequences very quickly usually

2714.04 --> 2720.04
did back then well I was I was proposing

2717.27 --> 2722.92
these ideas to somebody I know an older

2720.04 --> 2725.38
guy a Vietnam vet and he was a Navy

2722.92 --> 2727.03
medic so you know I mean of course he

2725.38 --> 2729.01
could have been brainwashed and bla bla

2727.03 --> 2730.27
but let's put that aside but you know

2729.01 --> 2732.67
what do you say to these people that

2730.27 --> 2734.59
were you know that stitched people back

2732.67 --> 2738.12
together with uh I mean what was it all

2734.59 --> 2741.3700000000003
just I mean it's a little hmm

2738.12 --> 2743.02
listen that happens I would very simple

2741.37 --> 2746.29
war happens it just doesn't always

2743.02 --> 2748.39
happen for the reason you are told the

2746.29 --> 2751.45
story if we are presented is often a

2748.39 --> 2755.5899999999997
cover story for much more complex and

2751.45 --> 2758.08
much more pragmatic and harsh decisions

2755.59 --> 2759.6400000000003
that are being made in another context

2758.08 --> 2761.0
that we're not told about because it's

2759.64 --> 2764.15
none of our business because

2761.0 --> 2769.01
we are the cattle and we're supposed to

2764.15 --> 2771.02
believe the government story that's of

2769.01 --> 2772.73
course but Ward though do happen they

2771.02 --> 2776.5
just usually rarely happen for the

2772.73 --> 2779.12
reason that we are being told they are

2776.5 --> 2780.5
either way there's no justification

2779.12 --> 2782.8399999999997
whether it's all a lie it's it's just

2780.5 --> 2785.81
it's an insane thing to engage in

2782.84 --> 2787.94
whether it's just a story or whether

2785.81 --> 2790.25
you're actually blowing stuff up for oh

2787.94 --> 2791.2400000000002
I didn't know Khan you know rebuilding

2790.25 --> 2795.74
is just insane

2791.24 --> 2801.25
the whole idea however it's done well

2795.74 --> 2801.25
its destructive but yeah you know it

2802.12 --> 2809.42
it's like Wars can be revolutions can be

2806.93 --> 2811.7
a revolution seeking help from the

2809.42 --> 2814.9
outside and another party from another

2811.7 --> 2818.0
government actually is riding on that

2814.9 --> 2819.9500000000003
and that's an opportunist yeah that can

2818.0 --> 2823.04
lead to all kinds of troubles but the

2819.95 --> 2825.74
thing is there are people often that do

2823.04 --> 2828.14
want to genuinely liberate the country

2825.74 --> 2831.02
and when they get the opportunity they

2828.14 --> 2832.79
will try and they'll just get more

2831.02 --> 2836.45
friction going and get more schemes

2832.79 --> 2841.65
going from the outside of course but I

2836.45 --> 2844.529
don't know it's you know necessity

2841.65 --> 2850.23
when a local government is just too

2844.529 --> 2852.749
shitty and too evil and just nasty

2850.23 --> 2856.17
against the common people then people

2852.749 --> 2861.1499999999996
will eventually just there will be a war

2856.17 --> 2865.4990000000003
could be a revolution could be a once

2861.15 --> 2867.9
again a civil war or another party

2865.499 --> 2871.97
jumping in and basically going with the

2867.9 --> 2876.2400000000002
rebels and then a real serious war so

2871.97 --> 2879.779
wars do happen it's just things like

2876.24 --> 2886.1899999999996
world wars are more complex because it's

2879.779 --> 2890.279
all riding on diplomatic setups and

2886.19 --> 2894.15
polarization like the dual polar world

2890.279 --> 2896.249
and when eventually everything all

2894.15 --> 2898.829
countries all regions are all split up

2896.249 --> 2900.99
in both parties then things suddenly

2898.829 --> 2902.67
become really inflexible because if

2900.99 --> 2904.6499999999996
anything happens to any of these

2902.67 --> 2906.989
countries the entire machine will have

2904.65 --> 2910.5190000000002
to respond and then the other part will

2906.989 --> 2913.5190000000002
have to respond at once that's world war

2910.519 --> 2913.519
materiel

2913.7 --> 2922.3289999999997
it's crazy but yeah it happens because

2918.859 --> 2926.119
of pragmatic reasons why do countries

2922.329 --> 2928.2200000000003
like Ally and become a giant Network

2926.119 --> 2930.23
because of the convenience is usually

2928.22 --> 2935.2099999999996
the financial conveniences that come

2930.23 --> 2937.369
with it and defense security of having a

2935.21 --> 2939.95
larger group of military at your

2937.369 --> 2942.4700000000003
disposal from the combined countries so

2939.95 --> 2945.6699999999996
it is logical but yeah the further it

2942.47 --> 2947.93
goes that the higher scale it goes

2945.67 --> 2950.15
eventually either there's a giant world

2947.93 --> 2953.99
government and that's never the

2950.15 --> 2958.2200000000003
Buddhists dangerous or you get a dual

2953.99 --> 2961.0
polar world where [ __ ] will eventually

2958.22 --> 2962.8999999999996
break loose and big Wars will happen

2961.0 --> 2965.68
it's just inevitable

2962.9 --> 2965.6800000000003
it's just how it goes

2967.37 --> 2976.29
ranting ranting um I know I think most

2972.03 --> 2979.1400000000003
people here or everyone thinks the Cold

2976.29 --> 2986.1
War was faked and I don't have a strong

2979.14 --> 2988.29
opinion on it yet I I think the real

2986.1 --> 2990.45
wars that were going on during the Cold

2988.29 --> 2993.18
War right of conflicts like the Korean

2990.45 --> 2995.85
conflict and so on those things I think

2993.18 --> 2998.6099999999997
were real I mean people diets their I

2995.85 --> 3002.7799999999997
guess as a result of the Cold War

2998.61 --> 3007.46
let's say but the Cold War wasn't that

3002.78 --> 3010.21
cold it was just not a full in war it

3007.46 --> 3013.25
was a lot of read you know unrest

3010.21 --> 3016.7
surrounding the border yeah there's a

3013.25 --> 3019.55
lot of conflict but more on a revolution

3016.7 --> 3021.14
scale than real countries attacking

3019.55 --> 3024.53
other countries because then the

3021.14 --> 3028.21
Cataclysm breaks loose and they they've

3024.53 --> 3031.13
managed to avoid that most of the time

3028.21 --> 3033.11
that's how it is a cold war but yeah

3031.13 --> 3035.4700000000003
[ __ ] does happen a lot and a lot of

3033.11 --> 3040.63
people were killed during this period

3035.47 --> 3044.12
because of the setup of the geopolitics

3040.63 --> 3047.15
socially the word in English for the

3044.12 --> 3049.0699999999997
deputy war I think is what was going on

3047.15 --> 3051.4100000000003
there right

3049.07 --> 3054.67
never heard this word yet a Google

3051.41 --> 3063.1099999999997
Translate tells me do you know this term

3054.67 --> 3068.9
no deputy or it's like it from a Korean

3063.11 --> 3072.65
word no I'm like remembering stealth or

3068.9 --> 3076.58
traitor Creek which means when for

3072.65 --> 3080.42
example in the Cold War Russia or the

3076.58 --> 3082.97
UDS air was for North Korea and America

3080.42 --> 3087.02
was for South Korea right so they had

3082.97 --> 3091.0099999999998
this deputy war Soto so-called deputy

3087.02 --> 3092.96
war which means yeah

3091.01 --> 3095.78
the there wasn't a war going on between

3092.96 --> 3098.12
Russia and America yet they take the

3095.78 --> 3100.7000000000003
took sides of other countries we fought

3098.12 --> 3106.48
against in other news proxies

3100.7 --> 3109.3689999999997
yeah XS through D ideology and yeah

3106.48 --> 3110.809
addiction before I go I have to just so

3109.369 --> 3113.4500000000003
what's your haven't seen in a while

3110.809 --> 3118.46
what's your what's your position on the

3113.45 --> 3120.47
spinning ball in space now well I don't

3118.46 --> 3125.63
really believe in it anymore

3120.47 --> 3127.97
I had like before when I started joining

3125.63 --> 3131.859
the show with Nathan show there were

3127.97 --> 3135.799
like two things that kept me away from

3131.859 --> 3138.589
letting go from the global model which

3135.799 --> 3141.349
first one were ships disappearing behind

3138.589 --> 3146.18
the horizon which for me was the proof

3141.349 --> 3149.3590000000004
that we live on a goober right so then I

3146.18 --> 3151.6699999999996
often after debating and debating and

3149.359 --> 3155.63
denying and everything I some point I

3151.67 --> 3157.839
accepted the angle of view a alternative

3155.63 --> 3161.03
explanation as a valid one and

3157.839 --> 3162.859
considerable one and that was still the

3161.03 --> 3167.349
other thing in the way which I couldn't

3162.859 --> 3172.25
accept that the Sun and the moon aren't

3167.349 --> 3176.03
material objects so at some point I just

3172.25 --> 3178.13
realized that if they could be non

3176.03 --> 3181.099
tangible they don't have to be material

3178.13 --> 3183.109
because if they were material the flat

3181.099 --> 3187.579
earth wouldn't make sense to me right

3183.109 --> 3189.17
because how the Sun would behave why

3187.579 --> 3192.52
would they be floating physically out

3189.17 --> 3195.319
there it's such a short distance then

3192.52 --> 3202.309
even for me the moon is still a hard one

3195.319 --> 3205.4
what I do with create even to me of

3202.309 --> 3207.98
course it's what we've been trained but

3205.4 --> 3210.14
it does it looks it looks but I don't

3207.98 --> 3212.66
look like rock to me it just well it

3210.14 --> 3214.5789999999997
looks like dust which would suggest

3212.66 --> 3216.47
obviously it's not cheese if you're

3214.579 --> 3218.63
gonna have crater crater of ice dirt and

3216.47 --> 3222.2
rock you know to make a crater you need

3218.63 --> 3224.4500000000003
a foundation of you know I'm saying it

3222.2 --> 3226.7
just looks like sand to me that's it

3224.45 --> 3229.73
just sand whatever you want to call it

3226.7 --> 3231.6499999999996
it's dirt it does look material it looks

3229.73 --> 3233.28
earthy it looks cursed you put it that

3231.65 --> 3237.21
way

3233.28 --> 3240.6600000000003
no no it didn't there's no raucous or

3237.21 --> 3243.9900000000002
any mountains it's all just bunch of

3240.66 --> 3246.0899999999997
dirt and sand and these weird shadow

3243.99 --> 3249.9599999999996
things on it that's how it looks to me

3246.09 --> 3254.25
every time when you made looks like this

3249.96 --> 3263.73
although - no no no it looks more like a

3254.25 --> 3269.67
frisbee or something okay no it looks

3263.73 --> 3273.75
really flat it looks like like this I've

3269.67 --> 3281.01
to me it looks really comics lenses hey

3273.75 --> 3284.31
yeah does it look completely flat it

3281.01 --> 3287.82
looks like it has curved a little yes

3284.31 --> 3290.0099999999998
looks man [ __ ] but I yeah

3287.82 --> 3294.9300000000003
in the me in the middle it's not as

3290.01 --> 3297.15
sharp as on the outer green ring of the

3294.93 --> 3300.6
moon as well so there's all these

3297.15 --> 3302.85
elements to it that just should be clear

3300.6 --> 3307.5
signs of you like yeah it's not perfect

3302.85 --> 3309.48
it's not a perfect illusion there it

3307.5 --> 3312.09
could be something else it could just be

3309.48 --> 3315.03
the only other aberration making another

3312.09 --> 3318.09
suggestion but I think to your

3315.03 --> 3331.8900000000003
physicality assumption bias even the

3318.09 --> 3336.06
modern ball religion I have to admit it

3331.89 --> 3340.35
looks kinda like a hole a ball or ball

3336.06 --> 3343.11
ish yet since the globe model tells us

3340.35 --> 3347.7
this tidally locked we always see the

3343.11 --> 3350.82
same side right so if if the moon but

3347.7 --> 3352.3799999999997
like like every month or I don't know

3350.82 --> 3354.69
every day depends

3352.38 --> 3357.2400000000002
I could see another side I would say

3354.69 --> 3362.2200000000003
alright it is a ball right yes we always

3357.24 --> 3365.1899999999996
see the same side so I kind I don't know

3362.22 --> 3366.6189999999997
if there is even another side to it or

3365.19 --> 3370.789
so Adams

3366.619 --> 3377.2400000000002
I can tell right just got assumed yeah

3370.789 --> 3379.809
side to it because an image doesn't have

3377.24 --> 3382.6699999999996
a side it's just an image it's just

3379.809 --> 3389.7690000000002
light that you're seeing it doesn't

3382.67 --> 3389.7690000000002
really have a side yeah probably

3392.769 --> 3405.499
again do you call yourself no not really

3398.749 --> 3408.5589999999997
um I because for the earth to be flat I

3405.499 --> 3410.569
mean I it doesn't mean that when I deny

3408.559 --> 3413.1800000000003
the globe the earth has to be flat I

3410.569 --> 3415.88
mean there's still a lot of things that

3413.18 --> 3417.98
the Flat Earth has to explain in order

3415.88 --> 3423.319
for me to believe in it because like

3417.98 --> 3426.47
seasons no flat or forever came up with

3423.319 --> 3436.7889999999998
any concept how season could be

3426.47 --> 3439.0389999999998
explained really they influence peaks in

3436.789 --> 3444.44
the seasons obviously like for example

3439.039 --> 3445.94
the do it spring break

3444.44 --> 3448.46
there's a moment where they're suddenly

3445.94 --> 3450.349
heated where right before their snow

3448.46 --> 3453.109
that's also like a seasonal effect that

3450.349 --> 3455.809
has to do with the the moon and the Sun

3453.109 --> 3457.73
be like the Sun being at their max and

3455.809 --> 3461.1400000000003
the moon being at its minimum at the

3457.73 --> 3465.14
specific period and the seasons are

3461.14 --> 3468.3489999999997
obviously driven by the intensity of the

3465.14 --> 3471.14
Sun cycles mostly because the Sun in

3468.349 --> 3474.1090000000004
every season just pretty much from day

3471.14 --> 3477.019
to day switches into a new type of Sun

3474.109 --> 3480.98
and object really like another ball but

3477.019 --> 3483.7299999999996
the type of light that appears that is

3480.98 --> 3487.549
actually expressed and hits the earth

3483.73 --> 3491.119
suddenly changes to another spectrum -

3487.549 --> 3493.549
like during the spring from winter it

3491.119 --> 3495.6800000000003
becomes more intense little warmer

3493.549 --> 3499.249
during the summer the heat is ramped up

3495.68 --> 3500.33
the most and then during fall it

3499.249 --> 3502.91
retracts

3500.33 --> 3504.47
and the moon actually becomes little

3502.91 --> 3506.17
stronger and then during the winter the

3504.47 --> 3509.72
moon is the strongest

3506.17 --> 3512.0
yeah but it's directly responsible for

3509.72 --> 3515.24
the average heat that's being exerted

3512.0 --> 3516.83
and yeah why does it work that way why

3515.24 --> 3519.77
is it there what is it

3516.83 --> 3522.68
no I mean then it happens we can measure

3519.77 --> 3526.55
the outputs and it really does change

3522.68 --> 3528.8599999999997
pretty much from day to day only only

3526.55 --> 3530.78
half the world experience that the other

3528.86 --> 3535.1
half of the world experience exact

3530.78 --> 3539.09
contrary their cycle is reversed

3535.1 --> 3541.79
yeah the same thing happens yeah exactly

3539.09 --> 3545.8700000000003
the this preserves this time during the

3541.79 --> 3547.67
winter in the North just it is Nikolas

3545.87 --> 3549.17
it is like this smallest you could say

3547.67 --> 3552.56
with the farthest away if you're gonna

3549.17 --> 3557.33
be physical about it and in the southern

3552.56 --> 3562.5499999999997
hemisphere it's warm it's big it's just

3557.33 --> 3567.23
a summer Sun okay so there are two suns

3562.55 --> 3571.6400000000003
or what no there is no Sun oh yeah it's

3567.23 --> 3574.01
all just a projection frequency latitude

3571.64 --> 3576.65
longitude based projection and just in

3574.01 --> 3580.25
the right time it will have this certain

3576.65 --> 3584.21
intensity from a certain period and it's

3580.25 --> 3589.37
just a different setting on the yeah

3584.21 --> 3594.86
beyond the equator they said it is high

3589.37 --> 3599.0299999999997
certainty pretty damn sure okay

3594.86 --> 3601.67
especially yeah if you just approach it

3599.03 --> 3603.8
with the holographic heavenly body

3601.67 --> 3607.4
concepts certainly less you can measure

3603.8 --> 3609.6200000000003
it the existence of seasons as we have

3607.4 --> 3610.64
them in the world we know right now

3609.62 --> 3614.0
mm-hmm

3610.64 --> 3616.7
are a little suspicious to me especially

3614.0 --> 3620.87
if we take in this account of the out of

3616.7 --> 3625.16
africa theory and evolution the idea

3620.87 --> 3629.8399999999997
that we all came from a fertile tropical

3625.16 --> 3631.64
bush and and we went up to like Siberia

3629.84 --> 3633.21
and said yeah let's stay here I'm sorry

3631.64 --> 3635.25
I mean I'm sorry

3633.21 --> 3640.619
this is people up especially people with

3635.25 --> 3643.23
Scandinavian heritage no cause it's

3640.619 --> 3652.71
[ __ ] it's all the evolution story

3643.23 --> 3654.329
right it's not I'm sorry I know it's

3652.71 --> 3657.079
part of people's culture because it's in

3654.329 --> 3661.44
there for generations but it's not like

3657.079 --> 3663.9900000000002
you're not a furry animal sorry it's

3661.44 --> 3666.089
just you're no no hold on hold on but

3663.99 --> 3667.7999999999997
you can adapt and their circumstance

3666.089 --> 3670.109
yeah but no one's kind of depth and

3667.8 --> 3675.15
these people can live there if man is

3670.109 --> 3678.45
naked strip man of the technology and

3675.15 --> 3680.94
knowledge and you don't last long you're

3678.45 --> 3683.64
not just stop about this adaption yes I

3680.94 --> 3685.68
get it but we're not designed I'm sorry

3683.64 --> 3687.72
but there are a lot of North from

3685.68 --> 3692.8689999999997
northern Russian natives that kind of

3687.72 --> 3692.8689999999997
disagree up to a certain if they adapted

3695.39 --> 3702.42
like you're just not come on I'm talking

3699.75 --> 3704.64
about the basic man the naked man you're

3702.42 --> 3708.78
not designed to to survive in these

3704.64 --> 3713.91
places it's not natural are we supposed

3708.78 --> 3717.03
to survive without houses or shelter the

3713.91 --> 3727.0789999999997
cell technology it's all it's part of

3717.03 --> 3730.4
the human state we're not designed to

3727.079 --> 3736.6800000000003
live in these places we're not I

3730.4 --> 3739.859
disagree if the necessity is high enough

3736.68 --> 3741.1499999999996
we can do anything so simple as that by

3739.859 --> 3743.2799999999997
the way I'm gonna round out the show

3741.15 --> 3746.339
because yeah we're kind of over time and

3743.28 --> 3750.5400000000004
debates I started so but thank you for

3746.339 --> 3752.849
coming Eric and Zinder and remote rain

3750.54 --> 3754.81
truth earlier so I'm gonna run that show

3752.849 --> 3760.1000000000004
knows

3754.81 --> 3761.63
because I will see you later right so

3760.1 --> 3765.02
yeah thank you all for coming it's been

3761.63 --> 3766.73
a long show this time yeah it's kind of

3765.02 --> 3772.0
hard to stop the conversation was good

3766.73 --> 3774.77
so thanks one for coming in chat please

3772.0 --> 3778.78
don't forget to subscribe to my channel

3774.77 --> 3781.91
and about this video if you liked it and

3778.78 --> 3782.15
I will be back tomorrow on the flat

3781.91 --> 3786.08
earth

3782.15 --> 3789.7400000000002
early-bird number 25 so please tune in

3786.08 --> 3791.7799999999997
tomorrow same time same place I will be

3789.74 --> 3796.4599999999996
at the Flat Earth debates on it Ann

3791.78 --> 3800.71
Oakley Channel 1980 so until the next

3796.46 --> 3800.71
time keep it flat
