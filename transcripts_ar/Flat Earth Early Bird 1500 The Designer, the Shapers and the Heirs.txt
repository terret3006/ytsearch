60.739 --> 66.24
1500 I'm your host Arwin and before we

PayPal patreon and membership system

85.2 --> 93.06
join button it'll be much appreciated

88.14 --> 94.979
and yeah I can use it a lot right

93.06 --> 99.0
so

94.979 --> 101.579
whether today is uh

99.0 --> 105.32
Cloud covered

101.579 --> 105.32
it's not wet or anything but

106.38 --> 113.759
less windy also but still some are still

109.799 --> 113.759
a bit of a breeze sometimes

113.88 --> 118.28
and yeah it's not super cold

122.28 --> 129.239
but yeah I mean it's

125.219 --> 131.28
not very uh not very bright so many of a

129.239 --> 134.54
gray day but oh well

131.28 --> 134.54
maybe that'll clear up

134.7 --> 137.54
uh

138.959 --> 142.20000000000002
right

140.879 --> 148.319
so

142.2 --> 148.319
it is Thursday the 2nd of February 2023

150.239 --> 153.62
check the temperature

155.22 --> 161.72
nine degrees Celsius right

158.459 --> 161.72
so it's not cold

165.66 --> 169.14
it's going to be like that in the

167.16 --> 171.48
weekend too then according to the

169.14 --> 173.45899999999997
prediction it might start freezing a bit

171.48 --> 176.89999999999998
at night

173.459 --> 176.9
in the new week

177.36 --> 179.84
all right

186.42 --> 190.319
all right on Monday it's going to be my

188.7 --> 193.39999999999998
birthday by the way and it seems like

190.319 --> 193.39999999999998
it's not snowing

193.56 --> 196.64000000000001
for a change

197.519 --> 202.98000000000002
because we had the snow

199.62 --> 205.459
a few weeks ago right anyway

202.98 --> 205.459
hey

207.18 --> 213.26000000000002
is the chat starting at the top

210.48 --> 213.26
that's funny

216.18 --> 218.72
huh

222.36 --> 226.019
normally yeah I'm just looking at like

224.22 --> 227.819
hey there's the chat over there of me

226.019 --> 229.98000000000002
saying good morning normally that's like

227.819 --> 232.44
in the bottom you don't get to see it

229.98 --> 233.879
until more people say something in my

232.44 --> 238.62
chat anyway

233.879 --> 240.959
right 500 uh 1500 episode

238.62 --> 243.0
not a clip show because I don't really

240.959 --> 244.86
do that and I'm not really that great at

243.0 --> 246.72
editing at all

244.86 --> 247.62
I haven't actually edited anything since

246.72 --> 250.379
my

247.62 --> 253.4
flat cat video which still kind of

250.379 --> 253.39999999999998
haunts me

254.879 --> 260.459
from all those years ago was so silly

258.419 --> 263.15999999999997
it's just that I don't really have the

260.459 --> 264.36
equipment or the patience for that sort

263.16 --> 267.0
of thing

264.36 --> 268.91900000000004
and again it's kind of embarrassing

267.0 --> 271.62
because a lot of people just do that

268.919 --> 272.94
they know how to do it

271.62 --> 275.46
so

272.94 --> 278.34
but

275.46 --> 279.12
maybe I'll try to get into it at some

278.34 --> 281.28
point

279.12 --> 283.259
because I do think that for example I

281.28 --> 285.78
could probably make interesting short

283.259 --> 289.58000000000004
clips just from things that I've said

285.78 --> 289.58
maybe put some visuals

291.12 --> 297.24
right but through video editing

294.6 --> 299.58000000000004
I mean I could even make a short out of

297.24 --> 302.16
it so who knows

299.58 --> 304.5
could just use my own voice from my own

302.16 --> 308.22
shows a recording of that and then like

304.5 --> 311.36
make a little clip show I I mean that is

308.22 --> 311.36
not super hard to do

311.4 --> 314.35999999999996
relatively

315.479 --> 319.919
I just have to find a good point

318.3 --> 323.12
but yeah

319.919 --> 323.12
maybe I'll do that

323.46 --> 329.75899999999996
I mean I think because I'm not drinking

325.74 --> 332.46000000000004
anymore there's more room in my life now

329.759 --> 333.36
and I've been feeling urges to like I

332.46 --> 336.419
wanna

333.36 --> 339.66
like build something like I used to

336.419 --> 341.82
build on my DND book

339.66 --> 343.91900000000004
or the campaigns of it

341.82 --> 345.3
that was playing with the the game group

343.919 --> 346.62
at the time

345.3 --> 349.139
because I don't really have anything

346.62 --> 350.52
like that anymore

349.139 --> 353.94
and

350.52 --> 356.35999999999996
yeah I kind of need that when I'm just

353.94 --> 356.36
normal

356.9 --> 362.039
[Music]

358.5 --> 363.9
so yeah might also be a good idea for

362.039 --> 366.18
the channel

363.9 --> 368.15999999999997
just have a couple of Clips out there

366.18 --> 370.979
also

368.16 --> 372.3
and I'm gonna nag Adam making over it as

370.979 --> 373.85999999999996
soon as he has a bit of time again

372.3 --> 377.639
because he doesn't really have a lot so

373.86 --> 380.52000000000004
it seems these days very busy

377.639 --> 383.819
but this

380.52 --> 386.639
with this yeah

383.819 --> 390.24
with the store and all that uh

386.639 --> 393.08
is like maybe get some special emoticons

390.24 --> 393.08
for the membership

394.56 --> 400.259
because there is a membership system and

398.22 --> 402.36
that is like a typical thing and I

400.259 --> 403.91900000000004
should re I mean I can't think of some

402.36 --> 406.319
things

403.919 --> 412.25899999999996
and that is also a project that I can

406.319 --> 415.819
work on to basically expand just

412.259 --> 415.819
gimmicks of this channel

416.94 --> 421.44
because compared to most out there that

419.28 --> 423.5
have had a channel for that long I am

421.44 --> 426.71999999999997
lacking behind

423.5 --> 429.0
lagging behind like that anyway when

426.72 --> 432.08000000000004
somebody got to show up and chat

429.0 --> 432.08
seven watching

435.3 --> 439.38
right anyway I connected up yesterday

437.699 --> 442.02000000000004
with

439.38 --> 443.94
uh

442.02 --> 445.62
somebody in my chat recommended the

443.94 --> 449.039
channel

445.62 --> 451.38
I'm not entirely sure who it was

449.039 --> 453.9
don't remember sorry

451.38 --> 456.599
but it was like a Dutch

453.9 --> 457.919
channel that was gonna do a flat Earth

456.599 --> 462.3
show

457.919 --> 465.78
and yeah I actually was there live and

462.3 --> 467.759
it seemed like it's

465.78 --> 471.11999999999995
kind of a newbie

467.759 --> 474.0
okay but I mean it was really

471.12 --> 476.4
interesting just seeing him talk saying

474.0 --> 480.78
flatter stuff in Dutch and being all

476.4 --> 483.539
Dutch and all that it was just like wow

480.78 --> 485.81899999999996
I basically never really watched

483.539 --> 488.039
anything like that and I'm just so used

485.819 --> 490.74
to English shows anyway hello landline

488.039 --> 493.74
locks first in chat

490.74 --> 496.44
D and D mainstream nah Dungeons and

493.74 --> 499.199
Dragons tabletop role-playing

496.44 --> 501.599
that's what it means to me

499.199 --> 505.08000000000004
Lynn Lennox anyway I watched that

501.599 --> 508.68
channel and like he actually played a

505.08 --> 512.2189999999999
clip a sound bite of Nathan Oakley

508.68 --> 514.919
it was like Hey I know that guy

512.219 --> 517.5
did do you know Nathan Oakley and they

514.919 --> 520.8
didn't know him so it's like they didn't

517.5 --> 523.62
know me Nathan they were using his voice

520.8 --> 525.899
clips the guy but he didn't actually

523.62 --> 526.92
know the channel so I connected him I

525.899 --> 529.56
was like hey

526.92 --> 532.26
here's the channel I'm actually on that

529.56 --> 535.5189999999999
channel I also have my own show

532.26 --> 535.519
it's all English though

535.62 --> 539.88
so it would be kind of funny if some

538.019 --> 542.72
people perhaps

539.88 --> 542.72
pop up

543.72 --> 547.44
like in their afternoon break or

545.82 --> 549.899
something in my chat that would be kind

547.44 --> 552.12
of funny some Dutch people Pro that saw

549.899 --> 554.399
me yesterday would show up I because I

552.12 --> 559.339
was basically just going laying it down

554.399 --> 559.339
in the chat in Dutch how I see it

560.82 --> 565.62
kind of typically what I did typically

562.86 --> 567.9590000000001
do and well they were all very much like

565.62 --> 570.18
oh oh tell me more kind of it was like

567.959 --> 573.18
they were really fresh in that sense and

570.18 --> 575.459
that's not bad by the way it I mean the

573.18 --> 578.64
guys started this channel like

575.459 --> 581.18
in 21 I think

578.64 --> 583.98
so he's probably like really freshly

581.18 --> 587.04
rolled into the Flat Earth and he they

583.98 --> 589.26
all seem to know about glow Busters and

587.04 --> 591.68
David Weiss and all that

589.26 --> 591.68
but

592.92 --> 597.4799999999999
there wasn't like a lot of like

594.66 --> 601.8
technical Acumen going around so these

597.48 --> 603.779
guys are not like physicist types at all

601.8 --> 607.1999999999999
but maybe they are interested in

603.779 --> 608.9399999999999
learning about that some of them

607.2 --> 610.86
because it is kind of important I mean

608.94 --> 613.5
you can just like say oh the Earth's

610.86 --> 616.1
flat and then just like oh I don't care

613.5 --> 620.22
or you could actually know

616.1 --> 623.64
precisely how and why

620.22 --> 625.86
like in the fields where typically

623.64 --> 627.24
Ballers and the math nerds that are into

625.86 --> 629.64
that

627.24 --> 631.74
like that's their specialty well you can

629.64 --> 633.54
basically break their specialty by

631.74 --> 635.82
really figuring out how what's going on

633.54 --> 638.279
and how they how they do things how they

635.82 --> 640.44
establish things and how they pick

638.279 --> 643.38
together their arguments

640.44 --> 645.24
how that works where they lend their

643.38 --> 646.68
data from what are their sources like

645.24 --> 650.4590000000001
because all of these things really

646.68 --> 653.64
matter the source is really matter

650.459 --> 656.16
like where you get where what you base

653.64 --> 658.74
your information on

656.16 --> 661.26
sourcing is very important really that's

658.74 --> 662.76
why like citation please is a typical

661.26 --> 665.9399999999999
thing

662.76 --> 668.9399999999999
like among the Flat Earth debaters

665.94 --> 668.94
and

670.26 --> 674.18
because it matters anyway yeah

676.82 --> 681.3000000000001
yeah they also but God dude Len they

680.519 --> 682.86
don't

681.3 --> 685.5
they're fresh

682.86 --> 686.519
like to them it's like wow new Flat

685.5 --> 689.459
Earth

686.519 --> 691.82
like that typical that that's what it

689.459 --> 691.8199999999999
looked like

695.64 --> 701.76
so

698.22 --> 704.339
they probably don't really see the

701.76 --> 706.56
difference and I don't know but I look I

704.339 --> 710.1
just was there like one little stream

706.56 --> 712.4399999999999
with a jet it lasted not very long like

710.1 --> 715.44
20 minutes or half an hour or something

712.44 --> 715.44
but

716.7 --> 721.5790000000001
yeah they all seemed like they were kind

718.92 --> 721.579
of new to it

722.959 --> 727.6199999999999
and a lot of people were just goofing

725.519 --> 729.6
around and there were also Dutch Ballers

727.62 --> 732.839
there too by the way

729.6 --> 735.5
oppositional and all that

732.839 --> 735.5
uh

736.74 --> 742.6800000000001
Jared and Bob are then then no problem

740.04 --> 744.66
no they haven't probably like watched

742.68 --> 747.0
they haven't like kept the track record

744.66 --> 748.92
because they're all fresh to it so they

747.0 --> 751.64
haven't seen all the weird [ __ ] that has

748.92 --> 755.0999999999999
happened in the conflicts

751.64 --> 758.279
they don't have that Community awareness

755.1 --> 760.5600000000001
about the scene yet they're all very

758.279 --> 765.32
Dutch

760.56 --> 765.3199999999999
that's what it felt like just Dutch and

765.8 --> 770.3
not so much into English I guess

771.06 --> 776.88
anyway but it wasn't it was an

773.639 --> 778.98
interesting experience being there and

776.88 --> 781.4399999999999
yeah left a comment with a link to

778.98 --> 784.8000000000001
Nathan's show

781.44 --> 785.82
and I might have some new subscribers at

784.8 --> 787.1999999999999
least

785.82 --> 788.4590000000001
although I don't know if they're going

787.2 --> 792.12
to be here live but that would be

788.459 --> 792.1199999999999
interesting anyway hmm

794.459 --> 798.8
right what else was going on yesterday

799.5 --> 805.44
Flat Earth debates was interesting live

802.139 --> 808.5
but yeah Nathan had a very short show

805.44 --> 811.7
again he rounded out very quickly

808.5 --> 811.7
with the after show

814.68 --> 819.899
[Music]

820.139 --> 822.98
right

825.24 --> 831.3
yeah flat side as show too

829.019 --> 834.54
but that was kind of simultaneous to

831.3 --> 836.04
well that other screen that I visited

834.54 --> 839.24
you know what I'll link up to that

836.04 --> 839.24
stream because it was

839.76 --> 844.519
saying it

840.839 --> 844.519
you can see me and chat there

845.1 --> 852.36
hey whoa

847.26 --> 855.959
those skeptic936 Nathan Oakley 9080.

852.36 --> 859.139
you let the after show die no

855.959 --> 862.079
It's just sometimes you need a couple of

859.139 --> 863.88
moments to like recover Nathan you were

862.079 --> 867.1999999999999
just looking for an excuse to quickly

863.88 --> 867.2
run out and you know it

870.72 --> 878.76
and hey you could also maybe throw out a

875.16 --> 880.9399999999999
subject sometimes in the after show

878.76 --> 880.9399999999999
thank you

894.42 --> 900.199
all right that it doesn't matter it was

896.519 --> 900.199
a good show overall and

900.3 --> 902.8389999999999
uh

906.72 --> 914.899
right flat side had to show about Giants

911.82 --> 914.899
that was fun

916.92 --> 921.12
I mean it was just kind of like a theme

918.779 --> 922.86
just like oh Giants here there photos

921.12 --> 924.839
ideas

922.86 --> 928.32
talking about it

924.839 --> 930.24
so yeah but I mean I am a believer of

928.32 --> 931.38
giants I think that our ancestors were

930.24 --> 934.199
giants

931.38 --> 935.699
like that humans were basically bigger

934.199 --> 938.459
and that now

935.699 --> 939.7199999999999
to us if we would see them they would be

938.459 --> 944.04
Giants

939.72 --> 946.279
right this is exactly the opposite

944.04 --> 949.56
of what

946.279 --> 951.24
Evolution based reasoners think they

949.56 --> 955.7399999999999
think that no we're actually growing

951.24 --> 957.66
bigger oh really no no I don't think so

955.74 --> 960.24
I think that over the ages will grow

957.66 --> 961.98
smaller or while we

960.24 --> 964.019
are Offspring just keeps growing small

961.98 --> 966.24
and it's probably environmental is

964.019 --> 969.24
probably related to that

966.24 --> 970.38
because I've been speculating about this

969.24 --> 972.0
is a

970.38 --> 973.8
it's kind of ethereal

972.0 --> 976.26
but that

973.8 --> 978.06
it's because of the environment

976.26 --> 979.86
that

978.06 --> 981.9799999999999
is just

979.86 --> 985.98
more and more

981.98 --> 988.139
transforming receding in a way but not

985.98 --> 989.94
super dramatically like it's not like

988.139 --> 992.76
climate change everything is destroyed

989.94 --> 996.7790000000001
it's just that there used to be

992.76 --> 1000.74
well basically one colossal world tree

996.779 --> 1003.98
that was cut down and then other smaller

1000.74 --> 1006.699
giant trees that were still gigantic to

1003.98 --> 1012.019
us grew out of that they were cut down

1006.699 --> 1015.199
until eventually we have like really big

1012.019 --> 1016.4590000000001
regular trees and only some of them are

1015.199 --> 1019.3389999999999
left and

1016.459 --> 1021.6199999999999
most are just smaller trees right well

1019.339 --> 1022.5790000000001
because of that process of that scaling

1021.62 --> 1025.1
down

1022.579 --> 1028.579
the environment has transformed I'm

1025.1 --> 1031.819
pretty sure that that is what caused

1028.579 --> 1034.52
the gradient to become more pronounced

1031.819 --> 1036.62
because I think that in the super far

1034.52 --> 1039.3799999999999
past there was basically much more

1036.62 --> 1042.9799999999998
pressure with more oxygen because there

1039.38 --> 1045.919
was literally more tree body because it

1042.98 --> 1048.919
was like almost everything

1045.919 --> 1051.919
and that made more air which made it

1048.919 --> 1054.38
more viable to be super big

1051.919 --> 1057.26
and because it was cut down

1054.38 --> 1059.66
is probably the reason why the children

1057.26 --> 1062.48
became smaller and smaller and became

1059.66 --> 1065.8600000000001
harder for the older generation and that

1062.48 --> 1065.8600000000001
kept going and going

1066.44 --> 1073.5800000000002
and I think that that is probably the

1069.679 --> 1075.679
reason why or that is a reason why

1073.58 --> 1077.78
outside of just like being purely

1075.679 --> 1080.0
esoteric about it

1077.78 --> 1082.539
anyway

1080.0 --> 1082.539
uh

1083.66 --> 1089.6000000000001
but yeah that was fun

1085.88 --> 1092.6000000000001
being in the chat with flat swords uh

1089.6 --> 1094.28
yeah also

1092.6 --> 1097.039
I missed

1094.28 --> 1099.6789999999999
Jim Bob show entirely

1097.039 --> 1101.72
but they all go simultaneously drives me

1099.679 --> 1104.1200000000001
nuts sometimes

1101.72 --> 1106.4
all in that same freaking time slot

1104.12 --> 1108.559
there's like four good shows at the same

1106.4 --> 1110.72
time like oh man why do you guys have to

1108.559 --> 1113.5
do that

1110.72 --> 1113.5
uh

1117.2 --> 1122.539
what was I gonna say right yeah but I've

1119.96 --> 1124.8400000000001
been kind of

1122.539 --> 1128.12
feeling

1124.84 --> 1130.34
uneasy about my performance on GM Bob

1128.12 --> 1132.559
and I've had very little feedback from

1130.34 --> 1134.8999999999999
you guys by the way about it

1132.559 --> 1137.12
even though I've kind of liked that been

1134.9 --> 1138.3200000000002
sharing like I hear I've been here check

1137.12 --> 1140.86
it out

1138.32 --> 1140.86
but

1141.5 --> 1146.72
and it's also because

1144.16 --> 1148.88
well because of how that conversation

1146.72 --> 1150.44
ended and then I was kind of flustered

1148.88 --> 1153.3200000000002
like didn't understand when he said

1150.44 --> 1157.3400000000001
arbitrary and I kind of want to go back

1153.32 --> 1160.22
and just ask him like could you please

1157.34 --> 1162.1399999999999
again explain what you meant and just

1160.22 --> 1164.84
like be really patient about it because

1162.14 --> 1168.44
I'm very frustrated

1164.84 --> 1170.8999999999999
that I still don't really get it

1168.44 --> 1174.559
it's like it's really nagging on me that

1170.9 --> 1177.02
I just don't understand what he meant

1174.559 --> 1179.0
I couldn't understand the context but it

1177.02 --> 1181.16
was like at the end of a show he wanted

1179.0 --> 1183.26
to round out so it was no point trying

1181.16 --> 1184.8200000000002
to ask him and like open up that can

1183.26 --> 1186.74
right at the end

1184.82 --> 1190.1
probably didn't have the energy for it

1186.74 --> 1191.78
but I really want to understand what he

1190.1 --> 1194.1789999999999
was saying

1191.78 --> 1198.08
a paganism

1194.179 --> 1200.24
that from my from my vantage point it

1198.08 --> 1202.1599999999999
was just arbitrary I just don't

1200.24 --> 1203.96
understand didn't understand the context

1202.16 --> 1205.3400000000001
and it's kind of been nagging on me a

1203.96 --> 1208.52
bit

1205.34 --> 1212.24
so I'm gonna try to go back there on on

1208.52 --> 1215.059
a Jim Bob show when he goes live again

1212.24 --> 1218.179
and at the beginning

1215.059 --> 1220.1789999999999
when there's more energy and just try to

1218.179 --> 1223.7800000000002
see if he will

1220.179 --> 1223.7800000000002
explain it to me

1228.86 --> 1232.6999999999998
because

1230.179 --> 1236.0590000000002
even though I I dealt with it graciously

1232.7 --> 1236.9
it it did really hurt like my ego in a

1236.059 --> 1240.08
way

1236.9 --> 1242.48
I have to admit because it's just like I

1240.08 --> 1244.52
I can't stand it when I just really

1242.48 --> 1246.38
don't understand something I cannot

1244.52 --> 1248.299
stand it and it's very rare these days

1246.38 --> 1251.5390000000002
but

1248.299 --> 1255.74
I have just like I yeah

1251.539 --> 1260.48
I mean I don't know all things literally

1255.74 --> 1264.5
but I do understand like almost anything

1260.48 --> 1266.3600000000001
just I just hop on the structure of the

1264.5 --> 1269.96
reasoning of the person explaining to me

1266.36 --> 1272.84
and thereby I can like decipher a whole

1269.96 --> 1274.76
bunch of things but I just didn't get it

1272.84 --> 1276.6789999999999
it's just like I don't understand what

1274.76 --> 1278.9
you mean with arbitrary in the context

1276.679 --> 1282.2
of what I've been talking about

1278.9 --> 1286.76
and that's still nagging on me anyway

1282.2 --> 1286.76
maybe you don't care whatever

1289.46 --> 1292.94
uh

1291.32 --> 1294.98
maybe you do

1292.94 --> 1297.46
maybe some feedback would be great

1294.98 --> 1297.46
sometime

1297.799 --> 1302.72
so that it don't just get the feeling

1299.96 --> 1304.52
that I'm just rambling incoherently to

1302.72 --> 1307.3600000000001
other people and they don't pay

1304.52 --> 1307.36
attention at all

1307.58 --> 1310.6
would be nice

1320.299 --> 1328.24
hit blur duck

1323.419 --> 1328.24
next level or whatever what

1337.539 --> 1344.98
oh the new the newer new level thing

1342.32 --> 1344.98
yeah but

1345.08 --> 1349.76
I haven't seen it Lane Linux

1347.6 --> 1353.6789999999999
but I mean those movies are not

1349.76 --> 1353.679
supremely interesting

1360.76 --> 1364.6589999999999
so I mean

1365.419 --> 1368.0800000000002
foreign

1374.679 --> 1379.64
I'll take a glimpse at it I I will watch

1378.14 --> 1383.1200000000001
it

1379.64 --> 1385.88
and if it's digestible to me then I

1383.12 --> 1388.4599999999998
might even watch the whole thing but

1385.88 --> 1391.4
seeing of what the previous versions

1388.46 --> 1393.32
have been like there's a good chance

1391.4 --> 1395.24
that I'm not gonna watch the whole thing

1393.32 --> 1397.78
because it's gonna be filled with some

1395.24 --> 1397.78
nonsense

1403.28 --> 1408.58
hit my suspect I don't even know who

1405.559 --> 1408.58
hibbler is really

1409.4 --> 1415.96
I mean he made that film oh okay I don't

1413.299 --> 1415.96
know who he is

1438.799 --> 1441.52
foreign

1444.98 --> 1447.98
anyway

1448.039 --> 1452.72
that's pretty much the material that I

1450.799 --> 1454.52
had

1452.72 --> 1457.52
to talk about

1454.52 --> 1460.1
so yeah I can talk about whatever

1457.52 --> 1461.72
when I got a title but it's it's like

1460.1 --> 1463.6399999999999
super esoteric

1461.72 --> 1466.46
it's not going to lead to a giant

1463.64 --> 1470.179
conversation or anything

1466.46 --> 1472.7
but yeah I like this formula the

1470.179 --> 1476.48
designers the Shapers or the designer

1472.7 --> 1478.88
the Shapers and The Heirs

1476.48 --> 1480.799
I've been attempting to formulate this

1478.88 --> 1482.9
for some time

1480.799 --> 1486.3799999999999
and I couldn't like get the words right

1482.9 --> 1488.419
for some reason and now I figured it out

1486.38 --> 1491.1200000000001
and this is a Formula because this

1488.419 --> 1493.159
basically describes the

1491.12 --> 1496.82
creation

1493.159 --> 1500.24
so I see the designer is

1496.82 --> 1503.26
like well the designer the god that is

1500.24 --> 1503.26
not here

1503.419 --> 1508.8200000000002
he's not like in the Physical Realm he's

1506.059 --> 1510.86
only in the spirit realm and he designed

1508.82 --> 1513.6789999999999
it

1510.86 --> 1518.0
right he designed everything

1513.679 --> 1521.179
he designed Spirits like us

1518.0 --> 1523.159
and the Shapers the Elohim the ones that

1521.179 --> 1525.8600000000001
actually well shape that's why I'm

1523.159 --> 1527.2990000000002
calling they shape the Earth that's the

1525.86 --> 1529.76
Elohim

1527.299 --> 1532.7
believe they were multiple

1529.76 --> 1537.1589999999999
and I believe that they might be what

1532.7 --> 1537.159
eventually becomes like the pantheon

1537.5 --> 1539.98
yeah

1540.38 --> 1545.659
all right but it's still a bit

1542.779 --> 1547.1
complicated but the Shapers like the

1545.659 --> 1549.5200000000002
original

1547.1 --> 1552.1999999999998
things that basically made everything

1549.52 --> 1555.679
and that created man

1552.2 --> 1557.3600000000001
and the man were The Heirs they were

1555.679 --> 1560.419
meant for the Earth

1557.36 --> 1563.299
but yeah I mean that's not like us tiny

1560.419 --> 1565.94
humans that was Adam and Adam was in my

1563.299 --> 1569.559
opinion a gigantic

1565.94 --> 1569.559
Titan of a human

1569.72 --> 1574.88
everything was big by the way back then

1571.46 --> 1578.779
I think that even the animals in the

1574.88 --> 1581.6000000000001
garden of Eve like if it was like that

1578.779 --> 1584.919
then everything was huge and everything

1581.6 --> 1584.9189999999999
became smaller when

1584.96 --> 1588.039
things changed

1591.38 --> 1595.94
right

1592.7 --> 1599.24
so there's a bit of a mystery in this

1595.94 --> 1602.779
kind of setup that I've figured out that

1599.24 --> 1606.559
I think happened in the far past my

1602.779 --> 1607.94
version of the Adam Eve situation what I

1606.559 --> 1610.46
think happened

1607.94 --> 1613.7
right there's some issues because like

1610.46 --> 1616.82
what is that Apple of Good and Evil

1613.7 --> 1619.4
is that literal or does it have to do

1616.82 --> 1623.3799999999999
with what eventually leads to the

1619.4 --> 1623.38
cutting down of the world tree

1626.96 --> 1632.179
or does that all happen later it's I'm

1629.96 --> 1634.659
not entirely sure whether directly

1632.179 --> 1634.659
connected

1636.26 --> 1643.7
because think of like there's so many

1638.72 --> 1644.659
logical direct switches right

1643.7 --> 1647.1200000000001
like

1644.659 --> 1647.96
if you were gigantic and every you were

1647.12 --> 1651.799
like

1647.96 --> 1654.44
yeah you were Proto like perfect

1651.799 --> 1657.44
design

1654.44 --> 1659.9
like meant the yeah the air of the world

1657.44 --> 1664.52
Adam and Eve

1659.9 --> 1667.52
like why would you even like procreate

1664.52 --> 1670.82
if you're just gonna live forever right

1667.52 --> 1672.44
well if the gigantic tree of the world

1670.82 --> 1675.02
suddenly died

1672.44 --> 1677.419
got cut down something like that

1675.02 --> 1680.36
well then it's essentially becomes not

1677.419 --> 1683.179
livable for you start to die and then

1680.36 --> 1685.1
procreating suddenly yields smaller

1683.179 --> 1687.38
children

1685.1 --> 1690.9189999999999
and to them they don't have that problem

1687.38 --> 1695.179
as much as you do being huge

1690.919 --> 1696.98
right and suddenly there is a reason

1695.179 --> 1700.3400000000001
to procreate

1696.98 --> 1704.26
because you can't live forever anymore

1700.34 --> 1704.26
because the giant tree is gone

1705.2 --> 1712.159
I mean this is mechanical logic that

1708.679 --> 1715.539
applies to that scenario

1712.159 --> 1715.5390000000002
you see see what I mean

1720.25 --> 1724.88
[Music]

1721.94 --> 1729.44
so maybe

1724.88 --> 1732.8600000000001
maybe Adam cut down the world tree

1729.44 --> 1735.679
maybe he was poisoned

1732.86 --> 1738.799
by the devil or something and maybe he

1735.679 --> 1741.02
himself got it down

1738.799 --> 1744.3799999999999
like the devil made him do it he

1741.02 --> 1748.22
suddenly knew that evil

1744.38 --> 1750.44
and he destroyed his own Survival like

1748.22 --> 1752.3600000000001
his own infinite Infinity like he

1750.44 --> 1755.44
couldn't handle Infinity anymore and he

1752.36 --> 1758.36
just destroyed it right I mean

1755.44 --> 1761.38
this would all make more mechanical

1758.36 --> 1761.3799999999999
sense to me

1762.2 --> 1767.8990000000001
to relate to the Adam story anyway

1765.44 --> 1769.76
I Ponder on these things I hope you

1767.899 --> 1772.9399999999998
don't think I'm blind streaming or

1769.76 --> 1776.2
something it's just that

1772.94 --> 1776.2
I really want to understand

1778.64 --> 1782.2
lojetto Crockett

1782.419 --> 1785.5590000000002
for Casey

1796.399 --> 1798.58
foreign

1801.62 --> 1808.4189999999999
so is anybody following what I'm even

1803.779 --> 1808.419
saying is he are you guys even listening

1814.64 --> 1817.2990000000002
guys

1818.72 --> 1822.64
okay can I have some connection here

1823.04 --> 1826.19
[Music]

1828.74 --> 1832.039
are you all getting it what I'm talking

1830.96 --> 1835.46
about

1832.039 --> 1837.2
do I need to clarify things further do

1835.46 --> 1840.02
you have any questions are there ideas

1837.2 --> 1842.419
in your head that pop in there when you

1840.02 --> 1846.08
listen to what I just said

1842.419 --> 1848.779
about the Adam and Eve situation

1846.08 --> 1852.399
about the formula of the designer

1848.779 --> 1852.399
the Shapers and The Heirs

1857.419 --> 1860.919
I hear you yeah but

1869.299 --> 1875.36
I mean how is that guys

1873.38 --> 1878.0
in content

1875.36 --> 1879.26
feedback

1878.0 --> 1881.419
like

1879.26 --> 1884.24
you're making me feel

1881.419 --> 1886.76
like I'm just a radio show in the

1884.24 --> 1888.14
background that you just have on for

1886.76 --> 1892.96
sound in the background or something

1888.14 --> 1892.96
because I'm not getting actual feedback

1893.72 --> 1897.52
this is a persistent problem

1898.039 --> 1901.48
why is this happening

1906.2 --> 1911.8990000000001
of the okay fair enough skeptic

1910.179 --> 1914.179
yeah

1911.899 --> 1917.6
I forget about that sometimes it's very

1914.179 --> 1921.76
early for people in the United States

1917.6 --> 1921.76
but still I find it very frustrating

1925.0 --> 1931.419
I guess it's a hazard that comes with

1928.64 --> 1931.419
the time slot

1933.26 --> 1937.7
people were smaller in the Middle Ages

1935.419 --> 1941.0590000000002
allegedly

1937.7 --> 1943.82
but there's a very logical reason for

1941.059 --> 1945.5
that too space comma troll

1943.82 --> 1947.899
yeah

1945.5 --> 1950.299
you know what that is yeah people were

1947.899 --> 1953.299
literally deprived of necessary food

1950.299 --> 1953.299
literally

1954.799 --> 1960.5
they just didn't get the right food

1958.039 --> 1963.02
like people in my country in medieval

1960.5 --> 1965.059
times if I'm to believe the records of

1963.02 --> 1968.0
it historically

1965.059 --> 1971.12
they mostly just ate a couple of

1968.0 --> 1974.539
potatoes and that's it every day at like

1971.12 --> 1976.82
one meal a day a lot of farmers and [ __ ]

1974.539 --> 1981.399
like yeah you know Wonder people stay

1976.82 --> 1981.399
small because they're very malnourished

1981.62 --> 1990.8799999999999
right that adds to getting smaller

1985.399 --> 1990.8799999999999
but that's not the normal genetic state

1991.34 --> 1997.6
and so when a lot of that ended a lot of

1994.399 --> 1997.6
people got bigger again

2004.6 --> 2008.58
right so that's not a

2011.44 --> 2017.519
H yeah it's not

2013.72 --> 2017.519
it's not completely irreversible

2018.039 --> 2022.559
it's just that if you get deprived of

2020.82 --> 2026.08
necessary

2022.559 --> 2029.86
energy or feed or oxygen

2026.08 --> 2033.4189999999999
yeah then your growth stifles

2029.86 --> 2033.4189999999999
and you will stay smaller

2034.299 --> 2040.48
but then consider that like hundreds of

2038.5 --> 2042.1
thousand a hundred thousand years ago or

2040.48 --> 2045.1
something perhaps

2042.1 --> 2047.26
or maybe even not even that long ago

2045.1 --> 2049.659
maybe just like eight thousand who knows

2047.26 --> 2052.679
don't know exactly the time scale but

2049.659 --> 2052.679
very long ago

2052.899 --> 2058.419
it was probably a lot thicker atmosphere

2056.139 --> 2060.879
the gigantic trees were there it's just

2058.419 --> 2063.2799999999997
it was so much easier to survive think

2060.879 --> 2065.56
of like oh you're going in a forest like

2063.28 --> 2067.96
in the spring day and it's like oh so

2065.56 --> 2070.899
good the air now think that like times

2067.96 --> 2073.179
10 like under pressure and it's even

2070.899 --> 2075.04
more glorious like yeah you're gonna

2073.179 --> 2077.08
like ah

2075.04 --> 2079.119
be aesthetic

2077.08 --> 2080.919
ecstatic

2079.119 --> 2083.859
right

2080.919 --> 2086.1389999999997
and probably be very healthy very

2083.859 --> 2089.08
focused and just feel like a little kid

2086.139 --> 2091.4190000000003
well that was probably the general

2089.08 --> 2092.619
condition back then and that has kind of

2091.419 --> 2095.6189999999997
receded

2092.619 --> 2099.78
because of the environmental alteration

2095.619 --> 2099.78
of the giant trees all being taken away

2107.14 --> 2114.16
right so this Medieval Time

2109.839 --> 2116.22
that's like just a few days ago compared

2114.16 --> 2116.22
to

2116.68 --> 2119.8199999999997
a year ago

2120.82 --> 2126.46
when that or or three years ago when

2124.18 --> 2128.6189999999997
those giant trees might have still been

2126.46 --> 2129.82
there right

2128.619 --> 2132.04
foreign

2129.82 --> 2135.04
Medieval Times not that long ago and

2132.04 --> 2138.16
it's very obvious that people were small

2135.04 --> 2142.0
because they were purposely

2138.16 --> 2146.2799999999997
kept malnourished by the rulers

2142.0 --> 2146.28
that well treated them like slaves

2155.92 --> 2163.14
right I'll bet you that the free people

2159.04 --> 2163.14
the people that would like

2163.24 --> 2170.68
flee and survive in the wild

2167.14 --> 2172.7799999999997
from those yeah that Society

2170.68 --> 2174.8199999999997
and that weren't just criminals or

2172.78 --> 2176.7400000000002
something but would really try to

2174.82 --> 2179.56
survive on their own in the wild that

2176.74 --> 2182.68
they would be freaking huge

2179.56 --> 2185.88
they wouldn't be the small

2182.68 --> 2185.8799999999997
shriveled peons

2186.16 --> 2191.3199999999997
in the cities and and the Farms right

2189.16 --> 2193.2999999999997
they would be pretty damn huge they

2191.32 --> 2196.3
would be able to just hunt out there

2193.3 --> 2200.2200000000003
because no like nobody comes there

2196.3 --> 2200.2200000000003
have great nourishment

2200.74 --> 2205.859
and

2202.42 --> 2205.859
become very large

2211.72 --> 2218.14
like two meters tall

2215.38 --> 2220.48
two and a half

2218.14 --> 2223.48
right they wouldn't be small because

2220.48 --> 2225.839
they were very well fed compared to the

2223.48 --> 2225.839
peons

2227.5 --> 2229.92
right

2232.42 --> 2238.839
for living naturally because even like

2235.06 --> 2241.54
the actual Kings and Lords and all that

2238.839 --> 2244.06
that were super supposedly well fed well

2241.54 --> 2247.3
they were living very unnaturally they

2244.06 --> 2248.859
were often like over feeding so they

2247.3 --> 2252.52
would have their own problem and get

2248.859 --> 2254.14
things like gout and all that [ __ ] and

2252.52 --> 2256.48
right

2254.14 --> 2259.7799999999997
so they wouldn't get very large either

2256.48 --> 2261.64
because they were living unhealthy

2259.78 --> 2263.92
even though they had all the food in the

2261.64 --> 2266.859
world they would probably indulge in all

2263.92 --> 2268.9
kinds of [ __ ] and sugar and like all the

2266.859 --> 2270.8199999999997
latest things not knowing what it even

2268.9 --> 2273.88
does to your body not being moderate

2270.82 --> 2277.06
about it yeah you get other problems

2273.88 --> 2280.839
health problems you get fat you don't

2277.06 --> 2283.119
grow Taro and muscular and right

2280.839 --> 2285.94
it's the same thing

2283.119 --> 2288.119
so that's how I see that about Medieval

2285.94 --> 2288.119
Times

2298.3 --> 2301.02
foreign

2305.94 --> 2311.82
yeah because I know that that person is

2309.4 --> 2311.82
a troll

2314.76 --> 2321.0400000000004
and so are you who complains and whines

2318.76 --> 2324.3390000000004
that's not feedback that's just gamma's

2321.04 --> 2326.5
complaining and whining yeah

2324.339 --> 2329.56
you're very lucky that I don't just

2326.5 --> 2334.48
immediately kick you out so not talking

2329.56 --> 2338.2
about feedback from you lot

2334.48 --> 2342.46
all right talking about people

2338.2 --> 2345.2799999999997
that actually follow my show

2342.46 --> 2349.14
and not just to try and tear it down

2345.28 --> 2349.1400000000003
you get it you dummy

2354.28 --> 2357.78
the black Sun you mean

2358.359 --> 2362.0989999999997
do I believe in it

2365.5 --> 2370.5
that's kind of complicated I mean I

2368.2 --> 2375.04
can't say I haven't seen one

2370.5 --> 2377.76
in my Visions I literally saw it

2375.04 --> 2377.7599999999998
but

2378.579 --> 2382.96
I don't think it's like a thing in the

2380.92 --> 2385.66
physical world I think it's a thing in

2382.96 --> 2388.38
the astral Realm

2385.66 --> 2388.3799999999997
or something

2392.28 --> 2397.78
I mean it was a spirit thing it like I

2395.56 --> 2399.52
was even like told like you want to snap

2397.78 --> 2404.02
out of it you want to get out of the

2399.52 --> 2406.66
dream you fly into the black Sun

2404.02 --> 2408.7599999999998
and I was really scared at first because

2406.66 --> 2411.52
I thought like no I'm gonna die then or

2408.76 --> 2414.46
something but I do I wouldn't I didn't I

2411.52 --> 2417.24
mutually then just snapped out of it out

2414.46 --> 2417.2400000000002
of the vision

2417.94 --> 2424.78
later got back into it like in my dreams

2422.26 --> 2428.32
but still like in that locked in moment

2424.78 --> 2430.6600000000003
that is how I got out so in that sense a

2428.32 --> 2432.7000000000003
black moon or the black Sun

2430.66 --> 2436.24
I believe in it but do I think that it's

2432.7 --> 2439.1189999999997
a physical thing out there or even a

2436.24 --> 2442.22
waking World phenomenon

2439.119 --> 2445.119
no no I don't

2442.22 --> 2446.859
[Music]

2445.119 --> 2449.859
okay

2446.859 --> 2449.859
foreign

2454.42 --> 2458.82
I know that's what everybody would think

2456.579 --> 2458.82
of

2481.74 --> 2485.64
metal slugs master

2486.47 --> 2489.6099999999997
[Music]

2495.16 --> 2498.48
right anyway

2513.7 --> 2516.2999999999997
foreign

2518.32 --> 2524.7400000000002
Story the Adam and Eve situation and

2522.4 --> 2528.04
the cutting down the tree and how that

2524.74 --> 2530.5
would have started the entropy cycle

2528.04 --> 2532.66
and caused The Offspring to become

2530.5 --> 2535.839
smaller

2532.66 --> 2538.5989999999997
because I mean I think that's a pretty

2535.839 --> 2541.74
brilliant Insight if I may say so myself

2538.599 --> 2547.2000000000003
because it's like mechanical logic

2541.74 --> 2551.7599999999998
like actual empirical confirmable

2547.2 --> 2555.46
processes that are now part of

2551.76 --> 2558.0600000000004
yeah of trying to explain what has been

2555.46 --> 2558.06
going on

2561.42 --> 2567.04
instead of it being oh esoteric and

2565.06 --> 2569.32
mystical and no it would not entirely

2567.04 --> 2572.619
sure if that's literal and like yeah I

2569.32 --> 2576.099
get that that was my problem too

2572.619 --> 2580.48
like also mystical in ways

2576.099 --> 2583.54
like a symbolic yeah but what if

2580.48 --> 2585.7
right I mean you just want to know only

2583.54 --> 2589.2
the symbol or do you want to actually

2585.7 --> 2591.0989999999997
know what physically literally happened

2589.2 --> 2595.56
well I do

2591.099 --> 2595.56
and this was my conclusion

2596.56 --> 2601.7799999999997
right and who knows what it even would

2599.14 --> 2604.2599999999998
have been like for Adam maybe he had

2601.78 --> 2604.26
like a

2605.859 --> 2615.0989999999997
a giant internal Cosmos like he had a

2610.66 --> 2617.56
internal imagination that was so vast

2615.099 --> 2619.599
maybe he could even like see just

2617.56 --> 2621.339
standard C into the future everything

2619.599 --> 2623.92
and that

2621.339 --> 2626.68
because of all that concentrated power

2623.92 --> 2630.4
that was all his

2626.68 --> 2632.859
by God's design and that he literally

2630.4 --> 2635.02
decided like seeing into the future like

2632.859 --> 2636.819
this is nothing

2635.02 --> 2638.56
it's just us

2636.819 --> 2641.619
there's no point

2638.56 --> 2644.4
and that that made him basically decide

2641.619 --> 2644.4
to destroy

2644.56 --> 2649.06
what was given

2646.48 --> 2650.44
to make to give himself a challenge

2649.06 --> 2653.2599999999998
almost

2650.44 --> 2657.04
in in arrogance one would say because it

2653.26 --> 2660.8390000000004
is like enormously arrogant

2657.04 --> 2663.52
but or maybe he just like got depressed

2660.839 --> 2666.22
didn't like I don't want to live like

2663.52 --> 2669.46
this forever this is so boring

2666.22 --> 2673.839
so I am going to end myself

2669.46 --> 2679.42
right maybe he wanted to die because

2673.839 --> 2681.72
he knew too much like that right it's

2679.42 --> 2685.48
when you really think about it

2681.72 --> 2687.52
reflecting to how such things work when

2685.48 --> 2689.619
real people that we know and ourselves

2687.52 --> 2692.079
think about things

2689.619 --> 2694.359
and then

2692.079 --> 2697.7200000000003
you get a whole different sets of

2694.359 --> 2701.7
reasoning right other than just the

2697.72 --> 2701.7
original mystical story about it

2702.28 --> 2706.02
because it's like assumed like oh

2706.599 --> 2712.599
you're not gonna die when you eat this

2709.3 --> 2715.42
apple what if he wanted to

2712.599 --> 2717.96
what if he was like no there's no point

2715.42 --> 2717.96
to all this

2722.98 --> 2729.52
or maybe it was a trick like that and he

2726.4 --> 2730.78
did eat from it whatever changed his

2729.52 --> 2734.079
mind

2730.78 --> 2736.92
maybe he did eat that apple and that

2734.079 --> 2736.92
because of that

2736.96 --> 2741.46
that he realized that it was all

2739.18 --> 2743.859
pointless

2741.46 --> 2745.7200000000003
and he needed to basically have the

2743.859 --> 2748.9
entropy started like

2745.72 --> 2751.5
that I don't know maybe I'm overthinking

2748.9 --> 2751.5
it a bit now

2761.38 --> 2764.4
low Cleary

2779.56 --> 2781.859
foreign

2789.9 --> 2792.63
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying

2792.099 --> 2793.78
yourselves

2792.63 --> 2797.1400000000003
[Music]

2793.78 --> 2799.5600000000004
here on my 1500th blood Earth early bird

2797.14 --> 2799.56
episode

2810.7 --> 2813.7
foreign

2820.079 --> 2823.2000000000003
say hello

2832.18 --> 2835.2
but oh well

2842.02 --> 2845.97
foreign

2842.74 --> 2845.97
[Music]

2864.94 --> 2871.38
well look it's just that

2868.24 --> 2871.3799999999997
there would have been different

2871.74 --> 2877.06
speeds at which The Descendants would

2874.96 --> 2879.2200000000003
become smaller so it's like almost you

2877.06 --> 2881.74
have Generations like that

2879.22 --> 2884.2599999999998
and they would probably just pick that

2881.74 --> 2888.22
the older Generations because they were

2884.26 --> 2889.599
living longer and learning to be wiser

2888.22 --> 2892.4199999999996
right they would have been naturally

2889.599 --> 2894.7000000000003
better Kings so

2892.42 --> 2897.4
yeah you take the long one because they

2894.7 --> 2899.3799999999997
live very long

2897.4 --> 2901.6600000000003
and they're wiser

2899.38 --> 2904.26
on average

2901.66 --> 2904.2599999999998
all right

2907.66 --> 2913.18
but I mean that doesn't mean that all

2909.819 --> 2916.66
Kings would be like that especially like

2913.18 --> 2920.74
if it's like a warfaring situation or a

2916.66 --> 2924.819
warlord more like that then

2920.74 --> 2927.24
it's less likely to be a giant

2924.819 --> 2927.24
because

2928.02 --> 2935.68
a shorter living person

2932.14 --> 2937.839
might just be more rash and like going

2935.68 --> 2939.52
after power doing all that because

2937.839 --> 2941.02
they're not going to live that long

2939.52 --> 2942.22
anyway if you're gonna Live Like A

2941.02 --> 2944.02
Thousand Years you're not just gonna

2942.22 --> 2946.0
trash the place because that means

2944.02 --> 2949.06
everybody's gonna hit any historically

2946.0 --> 2951.72
hate you for the next 900 years if you

2949.06 --> 2951.72
know what I mean

2952.66 --> 2955.3799999999997
right

2956.56 --> 2961.859
again mechanics

2958.96 --> 2961.859
it's all logical

2963.579 --> 2968.8590000000004
how do you think the giant tree stumps

2966.16 --> 2971.7599999999998
transformed from wood to Stone

2968.859 --> 2971.7599999999998
uh

2975.04 --> 2979.72
not entirely sure

2977.2 --> 2982.2999999999997
petrified yes

2979.72 --> 2985.18
but

2982.3 --> 2988.3
I mean it could be the flood

2985.18 --> 2991.0789999999997
right it could be that maybe even before

2988.3 --> 2991.079
the flood

2991.42 --> 2995.7000000000003
it was actually mostly just wood

2997.599 --> 3002.42
maybe even before the flood

3002.579 --> 3007.7000000000003
like sand didn't really exist like that

3008.22 --> 3015.359
maybe it was just all soil it was just

3011.88 --> 3017.579
like like wood pulp right

3015.359 --> 3019.38
well that makes great soil so maybe

3017.579 --> 3022.6800000000003
there wasn't even things like maybe

3019.38 --> 3025.76
there wasn't barely any stone at all

3022.68 --> 3025.7599999999998
Before the Flood

3027.92 --> 3033.1800000000003
or maybe there were I don't know several

3030.9 --> 3035.579
flood type events

3033.18 --> 3038.2799999999997
small ones bigger ones that basically

3035.579 --> 3041.2200000000003
Cause part of the tree

3038.28 --> 3044.9
to petrify

3041.22 --> 3048.7799999999997
but yeah it seems like flooding would be

3044.9 --> 3052.2000000000003
the most logical course of reasoning to

3048.78 --> 3056.599
figure out why the giant tree is

3052.2 --> 3056.5989999999997
petrified through some kind of flooding

3058.28 --> 3063.1400000000003
experiment turns into dirt right

3064.02 --> 3068.9
that

3066.3 --> 3068.9
foreign

3084.2 --> 3090.48
back then maybe termites

3087.059 --> 3093.26
didn't really function like that even

3090.48 --> 3093.26
right maybe

3095.4 --> 3101.7000000000003
it they wouldn't literally just not

3098.7 --> 3104.3999999999996
really do anything terrible to the tree

3101.7 --> 3107.16
they wouldn't like wreck it

3104.4 --> 3108.9
wouldn't burrow into it when it's still

3107.16 --> 3111.7799999999997
alive

3108.9 --> 3114.3
maybe it would only like termites

3111.78 --> 3116.0400000000004
because who knows what that giant tree

3114.3 --> 3117.9
would have been like maybe it had like

3116.04 --> 3121.079
all kinds of like chemical defense

3117.9 --> 3123.2400000000002
systems even so it would just like make

3121.079 --> 3125.52
sure that it doesn't get attacked by

3123.24 --> 3126.8999999999996
insects

3125.52 --> 3130.2
like that

3126.9 --> 3134.54
right we're talking about like gigantic

3130.2 --> 3134.54
things in the age way past

3134.7 --> 3140.5789999999997
with the entropy cycle seeing how

3137.16 --> 3143.52
amazing life still is now the processes

3140.579 --> 3144.92
of it how incredible that all works well

3143.52 --> 3148.94
then think like

3144.92 --> 3148.94
ages and ages ago

3149.04 --> 3155.2799999999997
it would have been like way better and

3152.76 --> 3157.619
more perfected and a higher frequency

3155.28 --> 3159.599
functioning of like everything

3157.619 --> 3161.7000000000003
so who know it would have probably been

3159.599 --> 3164.6400000000003
much better

3161.7 --> 3166.7999999999997
much more stable less subjected to

3164.64 --> 3170.24
entropy naturally because it would just

3166.8 --> 3170.2400000000002
all function so well

3173.76 --> 3180.38
so I don't think the giant tree would

3175.98 --> 3180.38
have been damaged by term termites

3182.339 --> 3188.4
probably only dead wood would be removed

3185.76 --> 3189.6600000000003
by thermal termites right probably would

3188.4 --> 3192.48
have been a perfect they would have said

3189.66 --> 3194.3999999999996
the perfect reason to be there it's like

3192.48 --> 3195.44
they probably the termites would only

3194.4 --> 3199.52
just

3195.44 --> 3199.52
gnaw out the dead wood

3200.339 --> 3204.02
and leave the rest of the tree alone

3211.4 --> 3216.78
right so arguably you could even say

3215.16 --> 3219.359
that soil

3216.78 --> 3221.3390000000004
the soil in the world

3219.359 --> 3225.42
is the way it is because it was

3221.339 --> 3226.94
originally all just

3225.42 --> 3229.26
yeah

3226.94 --> 3232.859
pulped wood

3229.26 --> 3234.96
all of it was probably originally pulped

3232.859 --> 3237.2999999999997
wood and that's why it became soil and

3234.96 --> 3240.2
not just rock

3237.3 --> 3240.2000000000003
and sand

3249.059 --> 3252.2400000000002
let's take a piece of wood in the ground

3250.74 --> 3254.72
and turn lights more funny yeah

3252.24 --> 3254.72
interesting

3258.9 --> 3261.9
foreign

3274.579 --> 3279.02
hello by the way steamy traveler thanks

3283.859 --> 3289.14
anyway thanks for a good question Arrow

3286.02 --> 3291.3
laning I appreciate that

3289.14 --> 3295.319
any more good questions would be great

3291.3 --> 3298.099
because it's a good question how did the

3295.319 --> 3298.099
wood Turn to Stone

3301.02 --> 3304.02
foreign

3313.94 --> 3320.64
by the way also just thinking about it

3317.88 --> 3324.059
so it's just an open question

3320.64 --> 3327.48
like could Forks could

3324.059 --> 3330.9
a tree that would still be alive

3327.48 --> 3333.18
could like for example The Roots be

3330.9 --> 3336.359
petrified

3333.18 --> 3338.0589999999997
and that the rest of the tree isn't or

3336.359 --> 3340.5589999999997
would it then break would it die

3338.059 --> 3341.76
probably die I mean the roots are going

3340.559 --> 3343.079
to be if they're going to be petrified

3341.76 --> 3344.1600000000003
it's not going to get any nourishment

3343.079 --> 3346.8590000000004
right

3344.16 --> 3350.5789999999997
but is that even possible could you like

3346.859 --> 3353.339
have a tree and then like submerge it

3350.579 --> 3356.3390000000004
and I don't know through the whatever in

3353.339 --> 3359.94
the water cause the bottom of it to

3356.339 --> 3363.14
petrify and not the top is that is that

3359.94 --> 3363.14
something that is possible

3363.66 --> 3366.319
foreign

3376.559 --> 3381.1800000000003
or does it really have to be entirely

3379.079 --> 3384.599
submerged

3381.18 --> 3386.64
for the petrification process to to

3384.599 --> 3389.839
engage

3386.64 --> 3389.839
do any of you know that

3394.93 --> 3399.4199999999996
[Music]

3397.619 --> 3401.7200000000003
yeah whatever Orinoco one more I

3399.42 --> 3401.7200000000003
disagree

3403.22 --> 3408.54
dude there's been there's a literal the

3406.44 --> 3411.2400000000002
petrification of that thing

3408.54 --> 3414.42
reaches further did you know that it

3411.24 --> 3417.4199999999996
literally has a gigantic root system

3414.42 --> 3420.059
that spread miles

3417.42 --> 3425.1800000000003
that's of the same material it's exactly

3420.059 --> 3425.1800000000003
like tree roots did you even know that

3428.16 --> 3434.52
I mean I've seen like stories about that

3432.359 --> 3436.819
I'm not even entirely sure though but I

3434.52 --> 3436.819
mean

3439.44 --> 3442.099
foreign

3443.76 --> 3450.26
people have basically done geology

3446.819 --> 3455.359
testing and figured out like yeah

3450.26 --> 3455.3590000000004
it's a it continues Underground

3455.46 --> 3459.38
and it goes very wide

3460.319 --> 3465.42
like several kilometers like 20

3462.599 --> 3466.92
kilometers radius or something

3465.42 --> 3468.599
so

3466.92 --> 3471.559
we're going to go on by disagree

3468.599 --> 3471.559
actually

3473.04 --> 3478.16
it very much seems like it was indeed a

3475.98 --> 3478.16
tree

3490.26 --> 3495.8390000000004
it's a piece of certain oh I'm sure it

3492.78 --> 3498.6800000000003
did I'm sure

3495.839 --> 3498.68
sure it did

3505.079 --> 3511.1600000000003
so Orinoco are you just stating then

3507.54 --> 3514.44
that that entire research

3511.16 --> 3516.72
geology research about

3514.44 --> 3518.52
the root system that that's all just

3516.72 --> 3520.8799999999997
makeup made up is that what you're

3518.52 --> 3520.88
saying

3521.22 --> 3526.9199999999996
oh they're just saying it's not an old

3523.319 --> 3528.839
tree oh yes yes except for the

3526.92 --> 3531.42
geologists that actually figured out

3528.839 --> 3534.119
that it has a giant root system and that

3531.42 --> 3536.28
it's like yeah that is kind of suspect

3534.119 --> 3540.02
that is kind of suspect isn't it that

3536.28 --> 3540.02
like why is it even there

3540.42 --> 3545.2200000000003
why does it reach out all the way there

3543.0 --> 3548.22
how's that work

3545.22 --> 3548.22
geologist

3561.2 --> 3567.2599999999998
yeah so so keep just saying no no

3564.44 --> 3569.4
orinocobo but you're not really

3567.26 --> 3571.92
achieving anything

3569.4 --> 3574.799
yeah it doesn't matter look there's all

3571.92 --> 3577.619
kinds of gaslighting [ __ ] going on out

3574.799 --> 3579.72
there on purpose where they say oh look

3577.619 --> 3581.819
it's so funny it's a tree and now it

3579.72 --> 3585.18
isn't actually a tree right

3581.819 --> 3586.98
that's called gaslighting

3585.18 --> 3588.72
happens

3586.98 --> 3590.64
yeah

3588.72 --> 3592.98
cause

3590.64 --> 3595.44
they want to

3592.98 --> 3597.66
make sure that you have a conditioned

3595.44 --> 3601.319
response of ridicule

3597.66 --> 3603.92
when it starts to get more out there

3601.319 --> 3608.46
in Media

3603.92 --> 3612.54
popularized by conspiracy theorists

3608.46 --> 3615.0
so they showed you that [ __ ] first

3612.54 --> 3616.92
yeah saying like haha oh it said you're

3615.0 --> 3620.94
intrigued no it isn't here's why and why

3616.92 --> 3623.28
Bloody blah blah blah blah boring

3620.94 --> 3625.68
nonsense

3623.28 --> 3628.2000000000003
yeah well at the same time there's other

3625.68 --> 3631.2599999999998
people that actually done field studies

3628.2 --> 3634.5
and measured things and they come to the

3631.26 --> 3637.8590000000004
conclusion has a giant root system

3634.5 --> 3640.68
whatever it is like we can't necessarily

3637.859 --> 3643.02
say it is a tree but it's like well if

3640.68 --> 3646.02
it is shaped exactly like a giant tree

3643.02 --> 3648.18
with roots and oh I mean you have an

3646.02 --> 3650.66
alternative idea of what it is

3648.18 --> 3650.66
right

3650.819 --> 3653.839
I mean

3660.26 --> 3667.46
it's all the whole feel of feed geology

3663.0 --> 3667.46
well a lot of it is yeah absolutely

3667.619 --> 3674.28
but geologists are also tasked with

3671.339 --> 3676.02
actual field study and measurements like

3674.28 --> 3678.0
scanning the ground figuring out the

3676.02 --> 3682.14
rock types that part

3678.0 --> 3686.46
is not BS that's just a field discipline

3682.14 --> 3689.46
yeah now the theories and the models

3686.46 --> 3692.7
that they make with that with their math

3689.46 --> 3693.9
and geometry that's another matter

3692.7 --> 3696.72
right

3693.9 --> 3699.0
but they do actually perform in the

3696.72 --> 3701.64
field measurements and have good

3699.0 --> 3704.76
technology for that these days that is

3701.64 --> 3707.22
still just measurement that's what it is

3704.76 --> 3709.0200000000004
I'm not going to rely on what they are

3707.22 --> 3711.18
going to say about it but hey the

3709.02 --> 3713.54
measurements are pretty cool that they

3711.18 --> 3713.54
do that

3728.22 --> 3734.48
geologists no I don't even know if they

3730.559 --> 3734.48
were officially geologists

3735.599 --> 3742.92
I don't really give a [ __ ] Aries

3738.48 --> 3746.52
geology is a [ __ ] feel most of it

3742.92 --> 3747.9
and I even figured that out before Flat

3746.52 --> 3750.96
Earth

3747.9 --> 3753.059
it's mostly [ __ ]

3750.96 --> 3756.26
you don't really learn anything you just

3753.059 --> 3756.26
get conditioned

3756.9 --> 3759.38
really

3762.059 --> 3768.44
and there isn't cherry picking that's

3764.28 --> 3768.44
just you not understanding the context

3777.98 --> 3780.98
foreign

3782.24 --> 3785.7599999999998
volcanic yeah but that's just [ __ ] I

3784.859 --> 3791.0589999999997
mean

3785.76 --> 3791.059
that's absolutely ridiculous for canning

3797.52 --> 3805.98
besides that hexagonal stuff yeah it

3802.619 --> 3808.26
doesn't go straight down it doesn't

3805.98 --> 3810.9
that's what would happen in a volcano

3808.26 --> 3813.599
yeah yeah you know that right you're

3810.9 --> 3815.579
like got common sense right like oh

3813.599 --> 3818.28
really oh yeah that that would go down

3815.579 --> 3820.619
like a volcano track like deep in the

3818.28 --> 3825.299
Earth yeah that's not what it's doing

3820.619 --> 3831.059
it's a big chunk and then suddenly it

3825.299 --> 3832.92
stops and roots go sideways yes like a

3831.059 --> 3835.26
giant tree

3832.92 --> 3839.339
yeah

3835.26 --> 3842.099
doesn't go keeps on going down like what

3839.339 --> 3845.119
would be like some kind of idea of a

3842.099 --> 3848.0
solidified volcanic

3845.119 --> 3851.2200000000003
eruption stuff whatever

3848.0 --> 3854.04
lava solidified

3851.22 --> 3855.7799999999997
yeah that that would go down in the

3854.04 --> 3857.819
earth like where that stuff came from

3855.78 --> 3859.38
right yeah that's not what this thing is

3857.819 --> 3861.96
doing

3859.38 --> 3864.42
it doesn't go straight down goes

3861.96 --> 3866.7200000000003
sideways like a root system in all

3864.42 --> 3866.7200000000003
directions

3883.339 --> 3886.94
yeah

3885.059 --> 3892.52
all right Clary

3886.94 --> 3892.52
yeah I don't really care at this point

3894.18 --> 3901.9199999999996
I mean oh the field the field has a

3898.26 --> 3903.96
story oh are you doubting their entire

3901.92 --> 3906.96
legitimacy

3903.96 --> 3911.42
no they just are indoctrinated by

3906.96 --> 3911.42
[ __ ] just like all the other fields

3911.7 --> 3918.359
to put it in a certain model

3914.94 --> 3919.38
but yeah whatever field measurements

3918.359 --> 3921.24
they do

3919.38 --> 3923.1600000000003
they still do and that's still

3921.24 --> 3926.22
interesting

3923.16 --> 3928.68
right it's just like astronomers they

3926.22 --> 3930.48
make up [ __ ] stories but they also

3928.68 --> 3932.8799999999997
look through telescope and get to see

3930.48 --> 3935.579
Celestial phenomenon

3932.88 --> 3937.26
well they make that measurement then

3935.579 --> 3939.119
they actually

3937.26 --> 3941.46
do

3939.119 --> 3943.44
data collection like that and that is

3941.46 --> 3946.799
like I'm not going to listen to their

3943.44 --> 3951.619
stories but I'll look at their sightings

3946.799 --> 3951.619
if it's not freaking CGI that is

3959.04 --> 3963.319
doesn't lava inside a volcano look like

3961.76 --> 3966.8390000000004
trees

3963.319 --> 3969.0589999999997
into a river well that's when it comes

3966.839 --> 3972.599
out of it

3969.059 --> 3976.2000000000003
like a Roots no

3972.599 --> 3979.5
body doesn't look like that at all yeah

3976.2 --> 3981.18
because it's not when a volcano erupts

3979.5 --> 3984.059
you there's lava coming out of it yeah

3981.18 --> 3986.8799999999997
you know what happens there's like two

3984.059 --> 3990.059
or three streams and those are like flat

3986.88 --> 3993.48
a flatten out they spread out and you

3990.059 --> 3994.6400000000003
get like this plaque yeah let's know

3993.48 --> 3998.819
what happened

3994.64 --> 4001.94
root system that means like tunnels

3998.819 --> 4003.98
singular tunnels that spread out that

4001.94 --> 4006.859
Branch out yeah that's not what happens

4003.98 --> 4009.64
with lava flow yeah that's not what

4006.859 --> 4009.64
happens at all

4024.68 --> 4029.14
inside on the edge okay

4030.92 --> 4036.14
I guess that yeah I guess that does

4033.5 --> 4038.0
happen like if especially if a volcano

4036.14 --> 4040.2799999999997
is like under pressure

4038.0 --> 4042.559
like before it explodes so the top

4040.28 --> 4045.559
explodes off then usually yeah it kind

4042.559 --> 4047.539
of like pushes to the sideway like and

4045.559 --> 4050.0
that might even seem a bit like a

4047.539 --> 4053.7200000000003
rooting branch

4050.0 --> 4056.74
because it's like pressing through Rock

4053.72 --> 4056.74
cracks and all that

4056.96 --> 4060.26
but that's not what this thing looked

4059.059 --> 4063.5
like at all

4060.26 --> 4066.1600000000003
just no it just isn't like that doesn't

4063.5 --> 4066.16
look like that

4069.5 --> 4074.92
it literally just doesn't go very deep

4076.72 --> 4082.339
I mean logically any kind of volcano

4080.0 --> 4085.28
it's gonna keep going down until you

4082.339 --> 4087.859
reach the still molten lava

4085.28 --> 4090.559
that's usually how that works if you're

4087.859 --> 4091.7
gonna find some solidified volcano or

4090.559 --> 4094.3390000000004
whatever

4091.7 --> 4096.5
right it doesn't

4094.339 --> 4098.62
it doesn't go deeper down into the

4096.5 --> 4098.62
ground

4100.31 --> 4103.539000000001
[Music]

4104.259 --> 4109.88
fossils of animals yeah yeah the

4106.64 --> 4112.400000000001
trilobites yes

4109.88 --> 4113.779
I find all kinds of weird I found like

4112.4 --> 4117.2789999999995
uh

4113.779 --> 4117.279
pyrite squids

4117.38 --> 4122.179
that was really interesting whereas

4119.359 --> 4126.02
literally like Squid's shape

4122.179 --> 4127.819
but instead of like being filled up with

4126.02 --> 4130.400000000001
rock or whatever it got filled with

4127.819 --> 4132.38
Pyrite I still have it somewhere but

4130.4 --> 4134.839
it's yeah

4132.38 --> 4140.1990000000005
don't know where it's like a little

4134.839 --> 4140.199
pyrite squid that was really interesting

4158.279 --> 4164.900000000001
[Music]

4161.0 --> 4168.44
such a wacker space comma

4164.9 --> 4173.0
have actually done that with my parents

4168.44 --> 4175.879999999999
in the 90s it was great I loved it

4173.0 --> 4178.339
we went to Carl sahua

4175.88 --> 4182.0
in Germany

4178.339 --> 4183.92
and just like yeah you can just go there

4182.0 --> 4186.799
and dig

4183.92 --> 4189.1990000000005
in the walls if you like and I did that

4186.799 --> 4193.5199999999995
and I found a whole bunch of stuff

4189.199 --> 4195.799999999999
including a pyrite squid

4193.52 --> 4198.38
that was like entirely intact

4195.8 --> 4201.14
so I did actually do that numpty dip

4198.38 --> 4202.88
[ __ ] and you're out here now just I'm

4201.14 --> 4205.88
just done with your gamma whining and

4202.88 --> 4207.11
they're retracting your message [ __ ] off

4205.88 --> 4210.26
anchor

4207.11 --> 4210.259999999999
[Music]

4213.32 --> 4216.389999999999
[Music]

4218.96 --> 4223.4
rise the Devil's Tower flat on top well

4221.6 --> 4227.679
that's interesting isn't it

4223.4 --> 4227.679
that's why I asked before

4228.08 --> 4237.08
can you petrify a tree

4233.48 --> 4240.86
with the most of the tree sticking up

4237.08 --> 4242.96
that's why I

4240.86 --> 4246.28
if it could

4242.96 --> 4248.6
yeah if that is a physical possibility

4246.28 --> 4251.78
then it could be

4248.6 --> 4254.6
that the trees weren't cut off

4251.78 --> 4256.94
but at literally all of the bottoms

4254.6 --> 4261.4400000000005
petrified

4256.94 --> 4263.139999999999
and then the Living Part died and broke

4261.44 --> 4264.799999999999
off

4263.14 --> 4267.1990000000005
like

4264.8 --> 4269.0
that's just still wood this is all

4267.199 --> 4270.32
petrified and at some point it's just

4269.0 --> 4274.34
like yeah

4270.32 --> 4276.199
a bit of wind a bit of shaking and

4274.34 --> 4279.02
poof

4276.199 --> 4281.0599999999995
it wouldn't have to even be cut off it

4279.02 --> 4285.64
could have just been naturally petrified

4281.06 --> 4285.64
and then suddenly the trees just broke

4285.86 --> 4288.099999999999
foreign

4288.38 --> 4293.54
would explain why it's all at the same

4292.04 --> 4296.48
height

4293.54 --> 4299.14
yeah why are all these plateaus at the

4296.48 --> 4299.139999999999
same height

4300.5 --> 4306.1
huh

4301.94 --> 4306.099999999999
if you guys even thought about that

4306.679 --> 4311.7390000000005
erosion

4308.6 --> 4311.7390000000005
gotta be kidding right

4314.9 --> 4317.92
I'm just saying guys

4318.98 --> 4322.12
hey Nature Boy

4328.46 --> 4333.32
you would like to see yeah I will yeah

4331.28 --> 4336.32
although I'm not gonna dig it out

4333.32 --> 4338.179
anytime soon unfortunately

4336.32 --> 4341.5
I don't even know if it's still intact

4338.179 --> 4341.5
it might be like broken

4345.56 --> 4349.64
but I was just really impressed that I

4347.78 --> 4351.32
just dug that out it's just like whoa

4349.64 --> 4354.58
look at that

4351.32 --> 4354.58
that's the squid

4357.739 --> 4361.759999999999
I mean it wasn't like a giant squid it

4359.84 --> 4364.219
was just a tiny little squid like this

4361.76 --> 4367.84
but still was like wow that shape that's

4364.219 --> 4367.84
that's a squid that's amazing

4378.8 --> 4385.04
that's very funny there Aries 106.

4382.52 --> 4388.219
what do you need a logical in the end

4385.04 --> 4390.8
because I just do

4388.219 --> 4394.159
because I can I mean

4390.8 --> 4396.28
did nobody think of this before like

4394.159 --> 4398.42
nobody

4396.28 --> 4402.5
all right

4398.42 --> 4404.4800000000005
the no trees oh caught up joint trees oh

4402.5 --> 4407.659
that's cute did nobody thought of that

4404.48 --> 4409.82
no it was sword

4407.659 --> 4411.139999999999
they sawed It Off

4409.82 --> 4413.259999999999
or

4411.14 --> 4415.34
a giant flood happen

4413.26 --> 4418.88
receded somewhat

4415.34 --> 4422.900000000001
and then the bottoms of the trees all

4418.88 --> 4424.9400000000005
got petrified in the slurry

4422.9 --> 4428.659
and then at some point

4424.94 --> 4431.48
snapped and they just fell over and then

4428.659 --> 4434.5
brought it away

4431.48 --> 4434.5
causing more dirt

4434.719 --> 4440.199
and that would absolutely like well give

4437.96 --> 4442.88
more bottom for life to grow in there

4440.199 --> 4444.44
right mulch

4442.88 --> 4446.719
eventually

4444.44 --> 4450.62
and maybe some of those broken off

4446.719 --> 4453.9800000000005
pieces also even as they fell over

4450.62 --> 4456.32
also still petrified

4453.98 --> 4459.98
right see it like that but it's like

4456.32 --> 4461.9
yeah saw it off a perfectly flat oh

4459.98 --> 4465.678999999999
really somebody's gonna make that effort

4461.9 --> 4467.0599999999995
or there's like a a giant laser beam

4465.679 --> 4469.82
like

4467.06 --> 4471.8
and there are certainly the giant trade

4469.82 --> 4473.0599999999995
like I mean come on

4471.8 --> 4475.58
or

4473.06 --> 4477.9800000000005
it just flooded partially then the

4475.58 --> 4481.159
bottom petrified and then the rest just

4477.98 --> 4485.0
fell over off guess what might leave

4481.159 --> 4485.9
just as much as a fleeing clean cut like

4485.0 --> 4488.12
that

4485.9 --> 4489.92
the same height everywhere with all

4488.12 --> 4492.08
those things

4489.92 --> 4495.26
could it be that

4492.08 --> 4500.48
that's why I'm asking is it possible to

4495.26 --> 4503.12
actually petrify the bottom of a tree

4500.48 --> 4505.639999999999
with the the rest of the tree still

4503.12 --> 4508.34
sticking up is that possible because

4505.64 --> 4511.4800000000005
that would certainly explain

4508.34 --> 4511.4800000000005
how it could have happened

4518.659 --> 4522.799999999999
foreign

4520.48 --> 4525.199
explanation before people studied it

4522.8 --> 4527.38
what do you mean before people studied

4525.199 --> 4527.379999999999
it

4530.42 --> 4535.46
I don't think that petrification

4532.88 --> 4537.8
knowledge is all that General

4535.46 --> 4539.96
or has been I don't think that a lot of

4537.8 --> 4542.860000000001
people know about it

4539.96 --> 4542.86
historically

4560.36 --> 4562.9
foreign

4563.719 --> 4569.6
but the point is is that people I think

4567.56 --> 4571.219
that are into the giant trees they think

4569.6 --> 4573.26
that oh they were cut off and then the

4571.219 --> 4575.86
rest of it petrified during the flood

4573.26 --> 4575.860000000001
but

4575.9 --> 4581.44
Who the hell's gonna cut it off so

4577.699 --> 4581.44
perfectly like that's ridiculous

4586.159 --> 4589.94
just seems more logical that they would

4588.199 --> 4591.799999999999
petrified with the rest of the trees

4589.94 --> 4594.339999999999
still there

4591.8 --> 4597.62
and that the petrification itself

4594.34 --> 4601.179
basically made that clean cut

4597.62 --> 4601.179
that is my idea

4603.44 --> 4610.78
so in that sense the theory would be

4606.86 --> 4613.5199999999995
that the plateau line the plateau height

4610.78 --> 4616.88
would have been

4613.52 --> 4618.860000000001
how the flood settled once the turmoil

4616.88 --> 4621.7390000000005
stopped that's the height it probably

4618.86 --> 4624.32
was at for a long time and everything

4621.739 --> 4626.419999999999
petrified in that and the rest was

4624.32 --> 4628.58
probably

4626.42 --> 4630.7390000000005
in the giant trees

4628.58 --> 4632.84
Sheltering

4630.739 --> 4635.12
waiting for the flood to end and then

4632.84 --> 4637.04
those trees broke over like broke and

4635.12 --> 4640.82
they probably turned them into boats or

4637.04 --> 4642.86
something right temporarily or rafts at

4640.82 --> 4645.0199999999995
least

4642.86 --> 4647.42
until the rest of the flood basically

4645.02 --> 4650.2390000000005
dried up

4647.42 --> 4653.84
and they could settle on land again and

4650.239 --> 4655.759999999999
now all the Treetops or the tree where

4653.84 --> 4659.9800000000005
it's cut off

4655.76 --> 4659.9800000000005
there were suddenly Stone plateaus

4660.14 --> 4666.64
I mean I'm just thinking about it

4663.56 --> 4666.64
how could it have happened

4666.679 --> 4671.3
and the funny thing is that this model

4668.42 --> 4673.4
still very much fit my

4671.3 --> 4675.92
my old

4673.4 --> 4678.0199999999995
story of creation

4675.92 --> 4680.42
of the old Story the one that I made

4678.02 --> 4682.820000000001
like in 2016.

4680.42 --> 4685.58
17 somewhere over there

4682.82 --> 4688.4
the flatter talks days

4685.58 --> 4691.5199999999995
it's still compatible with that

4688.4 --> 4693.379999999999
wood petrifice yeah yeah

4691.52 --> 4696.6990000000005

[Music]

4721.699 --> 4725.719
yeah but that thanks for the article

4723.92 --> 4728.86
seeing someone but that doesn't really

4725.719 --> 4728.86
tell me about

4729.98 --> 4734.199
actual petrification process itself

4735.92 --> 4738.58
anyway

4757.159 --> 4759.94
foreign

4768.28 --> 4773.139999999999
interesting

4770.12 --> 4773.14
thing to talk about

4775.82 --> 4780.799999999999
giant trees how they petrified I would

4778.76 --> 4783.400000000001
have then I wouldn't that how would that

4780.8 --> 4783.400000000001
have happened

4789.679 --> 4792.679
foreign

4794.6 --> 4797.6
okay

4811.58 --> 4816.5
all right I have the Earth Observer yeah

4813.92 --> 4819.76
it's cool

4816.5 --> 4819.76
but the thing is though

4821.6 --> 4827.659000000001
you can actually like Trace those

4824.78 --> 4831.94
Plateau type mountains like what's

4827.659 --> 4831.94
happening Rock wise underneath

4832.34 --> 4839.179
and then make out if it is actually

4835.48 --> 4842.419999999999
continuing to be very similar to it

4839.179 --> 4845.54
giant tree underground if it has some

4842.42 --> 4847.52
kind of a root system or a parent loop

4845.54 --> 4850.5199999999995
system

4847.52 --> 4852.56
right that's the point and that was with

4850.52 --> 4854.780000000001
the Devil's Tower they have done that

4852.56 --> 4857.84
apparently

4854.78 --> 4860.3
and they did notice that there is just

4857.84 --> 4862.46
something that they can only identify as

4860.3 --> 4865.9400000000005
that's Roots that's there's no way

4862.46 --> 4869.08
that's lava that doesn't correlate at

4865.94 --> 4869.08
all pattern wise

4887.179 --> 4891.7390000000005
I can't even remember where I saw that

4889.64 --> 4894.9400000000005
it's in a

4891.739 --> 4894.94
a recent video

4894.98 --> 4899.239
I linked it up on my early bird show at

4897.86 --> 4902.92
the time

4899.239 --> 4902.919999999999
it's like a week ago or more

4906.86 --> 4910.96
maybe I posted it in the early bird

4911.9 --> 4915.159
no [ __ ]

4929.0 --> 4931.9
hmm

4933.679 --> 4939.86
would you noticed that video

4937.58 --> 4941.239
it was on YouTube

4939.86 --> 4945.139999999999
but

4941.239 --> 4949.419999999999
yeah I kind of lost the link

4945.14 --> 4949.42
I didn't like bookmark it or anything

4951.92 --> 4957.5
channel was it

4954.5 --> 4957.5
foreign

4992.719 --> 4998.14
damn it yeah I'm sorry guys I don't know

5000.94 --> 5006.339999999999
I mean if I just YouTube search giant

5004.12 --> 5009.94
trees then I might recognize the video

5006.34 --> 5014.159000000001
if it shows up in the search results

5009.94 --> 5014.159
uh I might just as well do that

5016.5 --> 5022.0
like in 2000

5019.12 --> 5025.0599999999995
15 16 and 70. I would like bookmark

5022.0 --> 5028.06
everything that I came across now it's

5025.06 --> 5030.9400000000005
just like yeah it's another Drop in the

5028.06 --> 5034.120000000001
Ocean and it's just

5030.94 --> 5037.259999999999
it's too much I don't have any more room

5034.12 --> 5037.26

5070.06 --> 5075.1900000000005

foreign

5155.26 --> 5160.320000000001
whatever YouTube is not really helping

5158.08 --> 5160.32
me

5178.42 --> 5181.08
come on

5189.36 --> 5193.659
yeah no I'm not going to waste any more

5191.739 --> 5197.678999999999
time trying to find that I can't find it

5193.659 --> 5200.32
I'm sorry guys I just it

5197.679 --> 5203.34
it's a video that came out somewhere

5200.32 --> 5203.34
this year I think

5203.38 --> 5208.06
and I did actually

5205.719 --> 5210.88
I maybe even put it in the title of the

5208.06 --> 5215.219
show at the time but I just can't find

5210.88 --> 5215.219
it YouTube's not really helping me

5219.3 --> 5225.42
have you prepared my Channel with other

5221.62 --> 5225.42
Fe channels German show count

5225.639 --> 5231.06
I have one of the highest show accounts

5227.8 --> 5231.06
yeah I mean

5233.98 --> 5241.5
I do have a pretty high show con

5237.34 --> 5241.5
but yeah I mean

5244.12 --> 5249.88
my shows are relatively monotonous

5247.239 --> 5252.4
compared to other channels I have to say

5249.88 --> 5255.159000000001
everybody's all very entertaining and oh

5252.4 --> 5257.58
look at this oh video oh flash you

5255.159 --> 5261.9
with me I'm just like I don't want that

5257.58 --> 5261.9
I want to keep things kind of simple

5264.58 --> 5270.58
like all that flashiness just gives me a

5266.8 --> 5272.9800000000005
headache usually with other channels

5270.58 --> 5275.98
just makes me zone out it's like ah it's

5272.98 --> 5278.799999999999
just I don't need

5275.98 --> 5281.199
Keys being dangled in front of me just

5278.8 --> 5285.2390000000005
to prevent me from falling asleep please

5281.199 --> 5285.239
stop it but that's what I'm like

5312.159 --> 5314.4
foreign

5332.86 --> 5335.86
ah

5337.36 --> 5341.4
that's right

5339.1 --> 5341.400000000001
foreign

5346.96 --> 5351.699
Facebook or Facebook page

5349.84 --> 5354.58
well that

5351.699 --> 5357.9
this is misleading

5354.58 --> 5360.979
that's not the picture that I saw at all

5357.9 --> 5360.978999999999
[Music]

5372.88 --> 5375.12
foreign

5375.639 --> 5378.639

no make sure that it's not real oh

5397.92 --> 5404.88
thanks for that link seeking star water

5400.54 --> 5404.88
I mean but yeah no

5405.1 --> 5408.1
foreign

5438.1 --> 5440.6990000000005
hmm

5450.88 --> 5457.29
okay Orinoco one more

5454.03 --> 5457.29
[Music]

5461.76 --> 5467.8
you have a new video

5464.44 --> 5470.5599999999995
but you don't have any videos on your

5467.8 --> 5473.04
channel it's a the first video you're

5470.56 --> 5473.04
going to post

5483.1 --> 5489.1
oh your other channel what

5486.04 --> 5491.5199999999995
it does pretty look pretty tree like

5489.1 --> 5491.52
well

5493.239 --> 5498.718999999999
I don't know man

5495.4 --> 5498.719
your music channel okay

5504.52 --> 5509.92
I mean just an article saying like oh no

5507.88 --> 5514.2390000000005
it's just not

5509.92 --> 5516.639
well that's just a hoax I mean no

5514.239 --> 5519.5199999999995
I'd like to actually see more

5516.639 --> 5521.56
information about that claim that it is

5519.52 --> 5524.1990000000005
just a hoax

5521.56 --> 5527.4400000000005
I want to see who those people were that

5524.199 --> 5530.62
originally rolled out that claim

5527.44 --> 5532.15
and what information they actually have

5530.62 --> 5533.86
to present for it

5532.15 --> 5536.92
[Music]

5533.86 --> 5539.44
and not just hear other people say oh no

5536.92 --> 5542.08
it's just a hoax I mean and that's it

5539.44 --> 5544.54
that's all it is

5542.08 --> 5546.4
I'm not buying it

5544.54 --> 5548.739
that the same thing they've done with

5546.4 --> 5550.659
like claims of giant Graves and all that

5548.739 --> 5552.879999999999
that's exactly what they do it's just oh

5550.659 --> 5554.44
it's just a hoax oh really that that's

5552.88 --> 5555.88
enough that's your evidence it's just a

5554.44 --> 5559.299999999999
hoax okay

5555.88 --> 5562.5
yeah yeah no no

5559.3 --> 5562.5
I need more than that

5566.44 --> 5568.62
thank you

5591.87 --> 5596.62
[Music]

5593.86 --> 5599.139
foreign what's the favor of the evidence

5596.62 --> 5601.179
of it being a tree

5599.139 --> 5605.38
that it is shaped like a tree and that

5601.179 --> 5609.88
it has root systems continuations

5605.38 --> 5613.84
of these hexagonal shapes in the ground

5609.88 --> 5617.159000000001
not all the way like a giant rock

5613.84 --> 5617.159000000001
but like a root system

5633.58 --> 5640.0
right but I guess that it's a bit hard

5637.12 --> 5641.26
to find on Google well that must mean it

5640.0 --> 5644.139
fake

5641.26 --> 5647.46
because Google never tries to hide

5644.139 --> 5647.46
information from you

5653.08 --> 5659.58
but I mean it is kind of sloppy that I

5655.6 --> 5659.58
don't have the original video link

5665.139 --> 5670.08
I should have really posted it in the

5667.239 --> 5670.08
early bird chat

5674.62 --> 5677.82
unfortunately I haven't

5687.04 --> 5689.699
all right

5698.1 --> 5702.6990000000005
browser history yeah but dude that could

5701.139 --> 5707.1
take me

5702.699 --> 5707.099999999999
a very very long time

5709.179 --> 5711.719
I mean

5715.6 --> 5722.620000000001
I I don't even know exactly when it was

5719.86 --> 5724.0599999999995
it could have been months and months it

5722.62 --> 5726.699
could have been like in the summer I

5724.06 --> 5729.6990000000005
don't remember exactly when maybe it was

5726.699 --> 5731.98
in December or something

5729.699 --> 5735.54
but oh my God

5731.98 --> 5735.54
you know how long that's gonna take

5736.179 --> 5740.7390000000005
maybe I can let's see

5739.09 --> 5743.139
[Applause]

5740.739 --> 5746.82
trees

5743.139 --> 5746.82
strange hey what the

5747.82 --> 5750.719
no

5753.82 --> 5760.38
did I I literally got it in a second

5756.96 --> 5760.38
this is crazy

5761.139 --> 5765.84
no

5763.239 --> 5765.839999999999
really

5770.679 --> 5774.719
but

5772.239 --> 5774.718999999999
I mean

5776.82 --> 5780.96
where's the time stamp though

5782.32 --> 5789.46
is this really from December timestamp

5786.699 --> 5792.04
let's see how this works yeah it was oh

5789.46 --> 5793.5
my God so it was that video that I

5792.04 --> 5796.12
actually bumped into that's really

5793.5 --> 5796.96
idiotic I didn't recognize it but I

5796.12 --> 5799.659
didn't

5796.96 --> 5801.04
right strange theory that mountains are

5799.659 --> 5803.799999999999
trees

5801.04 --> 5806.34
from unveiled

5803.8 --> 5806.34
yeah

5807.04 --> 5810.04
foreign

5829.38 --> 5835.08
no no it was definitely not this one

5838.54 --> 5842.38
yeah I guess that it was the uh the one

5840.699 --> 5845.699
that I did actually bump into I don't

5842.38 --> 5845.6990000000005
know why I didn't recognize it

5848.92 --> 5851.1
thank you

5856.0 --> 5858.9
where is it

5862.199 --> 5868.44
this is not the right pictures I'm

5864.639 --> 5868.4400000000005
looking for where is it

5870.28 --> 5873.12
where is it

5883.5 --> 5887.699
oh this is another video

5890.04 --> 5895.36
okay let's dig further

5893.62 --> 5898.44
okay this actually does work

5895.36 --> 5898.44
surprisingly well

5902.98 --> 5906.78
I should do this more often

5933.34 --> 5935.9400000000005
foreign

5946.9 --> 5951.46
this is really weird though I mean

5949.12 --> 5954.4
there's things showing up in my results

5951.46 --> 5955.719
that I'm absolutely certain I've never

5954.4 --> 5959.58
clicked on

5955.719 --> 5959.58
that is really weird to me

5972.46 --> 5977.28
and why does it keep yielding the same

5975.04 --> 5977.28
results

5979.12 --> 5982.199
really odd

5991.84 --> 5994.02
thank you

6010.4 --> 6015.679
sorry guys for I'm not letting this go

6016.5 --> 6019.699
it's taking a lot of time

6023.639 --> 6026.0
foreign

6034.62 --> 6037.46
no

6050.28 --> 6053.179
foreign

6062.48 --> 6067.218999999999
anyway I am going to move on now

6070.98 --> 6075.54
same videos keep popping back up over

6073.5 --> 6077.639
and over again it's really weird like

6075.54 --> 6079.92
what do you mean more than six months

6077.639 --> 6082.62
ago the same videos pop up in the search

6079.92 --> 6085.62
result like I was watching them then

6082.62 --> 6090.26
that's really weird

6085.62 --> 6090.26
doesn't really get get it anyway

6100.199 --> 6105.138999999999
why are these videos

6102.139 --> 6108.719
sounds like R1 Sports is more detailed

6105.139 --> 6110.9400000000005
it had like the best footage but look it

6108.719 --> 6112.92
can literally be that the video is

6110.94 --> 6117.259999999999
deleted or something that that's why

6112.92 --> 6117.26
it's not popping up I'm not sure

6118.08 --> 6125.0
Bloomers are hacking you no

6121.4 --> 6125.0
hilarious but no

6129.26 --> 6134.58
maybe I still do have it in my freaking

6132.36 --> 6137.639
bookmarks I'm gonna check it after all

6134.58 --> 6139.5
maybe I still did actually say that I

6137.639 --> 6143.0
should have because it was a really good

6139.5 --> 6143.0
like really good video

6146.04 --> 6152.699
where

6149.04 --> 6154.56
where did I put it then

6152.699 --> 6157.46
other bookmarks

6154.56 --> 6157.46
there maybe

6159.9 --> 6162.799999999999
no

6163.679 --> 6166.34
damn it

6167.699 --> 6172.678999999999
no it's helpless I'm stopping it I'm

6170.88 --> 6174.659000000001
gonna spend the rest of the show a

6172.679 --> 6177.139
little less boring

6174.659 --> 6177.138999999999
right

6183.3 --> 6186.08
foreign

6195.179 --> 6199.32
well Nature Boy they probably did it

6197.58 --> 6200.54
with like

6199.32 --> 6202.92
metal

6200.54 --> 6206.159
wires like a

6202.92 --> 6208.32
like that I mean you can't make a blade

6206.159 --> 6209.638999999999
that like that big that would be too

6208.32 --> 6212.82
clunky

6209.639 --> 6215.58
you you'd probably just do it with like

6212.82 --> 6218.42
wire cutting then

6215.58 --> 6220.38
if it's that big I mean

6218.42 --> 6223.619
[Music]

6220.38 --> 6226.1990000000005
or maybe they literally just have

6223.619 --> 6227.94
thousands and thousands of people with

6226.199 --> 6230.879999999999
axes and they

6227.94 --> 6233.82
just all chop their bit but then it

6230.88 --> 6236.88
would become really messy

6233.82 --> 6240.659
that wouldn't give like a flat top but

6236.88 --> 6243.06
who knows who says they even like saw a

6240.659 --> 6245.5199999999995
tree maybe they literally just dug it

6243.06 --> 6246.780000000001
out they just cut the roots off or

6245.52 --> 6249.540000000001
something

6246.78 --> 6252.0599999999995
although that would be pretty tough

6249.54 --> 6253.679
but I mean just a gigantic tree like

6252.06 --> 6256.34
that

6253.679 --> 6256.34
poof

6258.84 --> 6264.139
but then again Noah was probably pretty

6261.42 --> 6264.139
big himself

6277.139 --> 6281.96
all right who knows who knows how they

6279.54 --> 6281.96
did that

6282.48 --> 6284.718999999999
foreign

6313.44 --> 6316.099999999999
foreign

6324.54 --> 6327.199
yep

6327.54 --> 6332.6
I know Jared said for right this is only

6330.119 --> 6332.599999999999
logical

6351.32 --> 6355.5
and I mean I mean you have it lying

6354.36 --> 6358.679
around

6355.5 --> 6361.44
so not sticking out of the ground then

6358.679 --> 6363.619
it's just chunks of it lying around of

6361.44 --> 6366.299999999999
that unique type Rock that's only

6363.619 --> 6368.04
solidly there

6366.3 --> 6370.679
I mean

6368.04 --> 6373.1
how the hell are you gonna explain that

6370.679 --> 6373.1
at all

6376.5 --> 6379.159
like

6379.199 --> 6382.04
come on

6387.84 --> 6391.4400000000005
that's right big Branch like chunks and

6390.42 --> 6393.36
cutting

6391.44 --> 6395.839999999999
sizes yeah yeah

6393.36 --> 6395.839999999999
sure

6405.739 --> 6411.239
a good source would be nice by the way

6408.6 --> 6413.88
to get some of those details here at

6411.239 --> 6415.86
Sanford like somebody that's actually

6413.88 --> 6418.9400000000005
I mean it would be really cool if there

6415.86 --> 6418.94
was basically a

6419.1 --> 6426.3
a person that like is geology interested

6422.639 --> 6429.900000000001
but not part of the system per se

6426.3 --> 6432.2390000000005
doing it paid by the system

6429.9 --> 6434.159
that is just like gonna do some

6432.239 --> 6435.599999999999
exploration in that region like yeah

6434.159 --> 6438.0599999999995
where are they then just make some

6435.6 --> 6440.46
footage like hey here's a piece that's

6438.06 --> 6443.159000000001
obviously of the same Rock

6440.46 --> 6444.9
there and there and maybe a drone view

6443.159 --> 6448.199
or something that would be really

6444.9 --> 6450.839999999999
helpful like a more in the field View

6448.199 --> 6453.178999999999
instead of like Oh see it looks like a

6450.84 --> 6456.360000000001
tree oh yeah other all the footage not

6453.179 --> 6458.52
related yeah that's all very cool

6456.36 --> 6461.639
I'd like to see more like on the ground

6458.52 --> 6462.780000000001
imagery of all that like what is there

6461.639 --> 6464.219
actually

6462.78 --> 6466.44
these other chunks what did they

6464.219 --> 6467.82
actually look like is there any footage

6466.44 --> 6469.86
of that

6467.82 --> 6471.659
that would be great George Sanford if

6469.86 --> 6474.259999999999
you have a source for that

6471.659 --> 6474.259999999999
do you

6479.04 --> 6485.159
oh my God look at Jim Smith nerd dumbass

6485.34 --> 6488.34
ridiculous

6491.4 --> 6497.638999999999
you cannot seriously believe

6494.699 --> 6500.299999999999
what you just wrote down there you can't

6497.639 --> 6500.3
be serious

6508.02 --> 6514.080000000001
Panic Rock

6509.6 --> 6517.38
hey Jim Smith hey could you show me

6514.08 --> 6521.3
somewhere else in the world in the

6517.38 --> 6526.08
vicinity of actual volcanic activity

6521.3 --> 6530.54
show me these hexagonal blocks yeah show

6526.08 --> 6530.54
me that then okay

6530.58 --> 6535.46
huh

6532.44 --> 6535.46
good luck with that

6536.36 --> 6543.719
this is ridiculous you think that that

6539.76 --> 6545.9400000000005
stuff is volcanic in origin you have

6543.719 --> 6548.179
absolutely no idea what you're talking

6545.94 --> 6548.178999999999
about

6548.58 --> 6555.659
maybe mountain ranges are Fallen trees

6552.0 --> 6558.119
yeah maybe

6555.659 --> 6560.339999999999
some of them certainly very much seem

6558.119 --> 6564.299999999999
like it

6560.34 --> 6567.900000000001
right and hey in my theory or theory in

6564.3 --> 6571.38
my view my vision you could say of the

6567.9 --> 6574.379999999999
past I believe that it was all once tree

6571.38 --> 6576.0
all of it the entire Earth was basically

6574.38 --> 6580.4400000000005
a giant tree

6576.0 --> 6582.6
as in and I've said this like years ago

6580.44 --> 6586.678999999999
and I believe that all the continents

6582.6 --> 6588.6
are literally the cut off roots of the

6586.679 --> 6591.3
original world tree

6588.6 --> 6593.639
upon after that was gone

6591.3 --> 6599.119000000001
more

6593.639 --> 6599.119
smaller trees basically grew out of it

6600.239 --> 6605.04
right which were like the the giant

6602.94 --> 6606.54
trees like the plateaus

6605.04 --> 6609.119
that we know

6606.54 --> 6611.4
and then they were cut off and then

6609.119 --> 6615.739
there's smaller trees that basically

6611.4 --> 6615.739
attempted and now there aren't anymore

6616.26 --> 6621.360000000001
there's just other Woody yeah the

6619.679 --> 6623.82
regular smaller trees that grow

6621.36 --> 6625.5599999999995
everywhere and maybe they in the right

6623.82 --> 6627.96
circumstances they would grow pretty

6625.56 --> 6629.6990000000005
huge as well

6627.96 --> 6633.36
but

6629.699 --> 6635.159
I've thought of that like it is all a

6633.36 --> 6637.98
giant tree like

6635.159 --> 6640.46
there was probably no

6637.98 --> 6640.459999999999
Rock

6642.42 --> 6648.54
not really rock

6645.26 --> 6650.6990000000005
minerals around but I think that maybe

6648.54 --> 6652.86
it was just oh a giant tree that the

6650.699 --> 6655.099999999999
land was originally a giant tree in

6652.86 --> 6655.099999999999
water

6658.02 --> 6662.88
and the tree itself was probably filled

6661.26 --> 6665.4800000000005
with minerals

6662.88 --> 6665.4800000000005
foreign

6665.719 --> 6671.82
RPG lore generator that's hilarious

6669.54 --> 6673.46
but yeah I mean

6671.82 --> 6676.84
I am

6673.46 --> 6676.84
[Laughter]

6678.78 --> 6683.179
but this is just how I think about it

6683.219 --> 6688.32
I think everything was gigantic and I

6685.619 --> 6691.5
mean insanely gigantic that makes us

6688.32 --> 6693.84
look like ants

6691.5 --> 6695.76
smaller than ants

6693.84 --> 6699.84
and

6695.76 --> 6702.3
it all got downsized again and again and

6699.84 --> 6706.76
again and again

6702.3 --> 6706.76
until it all turn into what it is now

6709.5 --> 6714.02
right anyway I'm gonna run out to show

6715.44 --> 6718.86
it's fun

6716.94 --> 6721.5
I thought so at least

6718.86 --> 6724.38
sorry for like the silent pauses me

6721.5 --> 6726.42
trying to find that video and not really

6724.38 --> 6728.34
succeeding

6726.42 --> 6733.34
