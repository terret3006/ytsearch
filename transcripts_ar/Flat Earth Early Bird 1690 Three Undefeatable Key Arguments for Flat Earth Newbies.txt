I know you guys helped me out yesterday

102.9 --> 105.799
but uh

111.72 --> 116.34
I could really use some more support

113.399 --> 118.74
that would be fantastic

116.34 --> 121.799
right anyway

118.74 --> 125.479
weather is yeah

121.799 --> 125.47900000000001
it's been kind of clouded

126.0 --> 131.34
and a little bit rainy although I

128.22 --> 133.92
haven't really that's been this night

131.34 --> 135.36
so yeah it doesn't look like it's gonna

133.92 --> 138.42
be

135.36 --> 139.18
nice and sunny today with this much

138.42 --> 140.94
clouds around

139.18 --> 143.94
[Music]

140.94 --> 146.22
but I don't know they are flying up

143.94 --> 148.5
there so maybe

146.22 --> 151.68
in like half an hour or an hour it will

148.5 --> 156.08
clear up who knows

151.68 --> 156.08
but it isn't right now it's like this

159.42 --> 164.7
I think it's still decently warm I think

161.879 --> 169.26
probably like

164.7 --> 172.01899999999998
21 degrees or something

169.26 --> 175.379
we'll see right anyway

172.019 --> 181.019
hello dank first in chat good to see you

175.379 --> 181.01899999999998
it is Tuesday the 15th of August 2023

185.04 --> 189.319
temperature 22 degrees right

194.94 --> 202.879
right and I'm starting a little bit late

198.84 --> 202.879
I don't know how that happened but

207.0 --> 210.099
[Music]

211.8 --> 217.519
low fuzzy Bush monk Richard G

227.04 --> 231.12
right

228.599 --> 234.42
so yeah uh

231.12 --> 237.62
today I'm just gonna try to like not be

234.42 --> 237.61999999999998
so freaking aggressive

247.019 --> 253.31900000000002
feel overall pretty good but I guess

249.659 --> 255.599
that can be a bit snarly or something

253.319 --> 257.94
whatever you're gonna call that

255.599 --> 259.68
what happened yesterday at the last part

257.94 --> 262.919
of the show

259.68 --> 267.02
I don't want to have that happen

262.919 --> 267.02
today like at all

268.259 --> 272.36
preferably for a long time to come

273.419 --> 277.979
because for All Forever all that

275.759 --> 280.16
passionate expression and all that it

277.979 --> 280.15999999999997
just

280.919 --> 284.78
it's so freaking pointless

297.919 --> 301.58
right so

311.22 --> 315.68
okay hello slow mo buggy good to see you

330.479 --> 335.59999999999997
I think weirdly enough I didn't eat

333.0 --> 335.6
enough yesterday

337.02 --> 343.44
but today I do have an Illuminati Castle

341.34 --> 347.0
really looking forward to it because I'm

343.44 --> 347.0
actually really hungry right now

347.699 --> 353.46000000000004
but also still like in the middle of

350.88 --> 356.88
trying to wake up properly

353.46 --> 360.18
because I woke up like 15 minutes before

356.88 --> 362.94
the show would normally start

360.18 --> 366.02
so I have to hurry at all and that's

362.94 --> 366.02
reason why I'm like

378.66 --> 381.66
ah

390.08 --> 397.38
right so yeah yesterday was typical day

395.22 --> 401.66
Flat Earth debates

397.38 --> 404.4
lasted pretty long the after show

401.66 --> 406.139
uh and then even after the after show

404.4 --> 409.75899999999996
recording stopped Nathan still hung

406.139 --> 409.759
around for like an over an hour

415.319 --> 421.97900000000004
it's a discussing Community things

419.22 --> 427.319
uh Owen Benjamin also

421.979 --> 430.4

427.319 --> 430.40000000000003
that was interesting

432.05 --> 435.139
[Music]

442.919 --> 449.46
continued watching

446.28 --> 451.31899999999996
ghost Wars I'm like at the last episode

449.46 --> 456.0
now

451.319 --> 458.94
and I mean like it it is definitely not

456.0 --> 461.46
what it started out to be

458.94 --> 464.099
and it is basically full of negative

461.46 --> 466.71999999999997
programming and [ __ ]

464.099 --> 476.34
like it all slips in

466.72 --> 478.319
[Music]

476.34 --> 481.56
yeah that's pretty much it other than

478.319 --> 488.94
that I'm kind of a blank slate

481.56 --> 492.0
[Music]

488.94 --> 494.28
from the Dutch alternative news sources

492.0 --> 496.199
I'm getting that like

494.28 --> 498.9
[Music]

496.199 --> 502.91900000000004
the propaganda is still going but like

498.9 --> 505.979
people are just not buying it at all

502.919 --> 508.31899999999996
and these parties here the cartel

505.979 --> 509.81899999999996
parties have like been all these people

508.319 --> 513.659
in there

509.819 --> 515.64
they're definitely involved with the

513.659 --> 518.8199999999999
with the Corruptions and all that

515.64 --> 521.159
they're like leaving all of a sudden for

518.82 --> 523.5600000000001
a while that's been happening and then

521.159 --> 525.36
new people come to replace them and they

523.56 --> 528.899
are those new people are basically

525.36 --> 532.74
trying to do exactly the same damn thing

528.899 --> 534.42
so they just rouletted the puppets

532.74 --> 536.94
that's what it's starting to feel like

534.42 --> 540.0
and everybody's recognize it Rising that

536.94 --> 541.9200000000001
like it's like oh you're just exactly

540.0 --> 544.16
the same you're gonna try to do exactly

541.92 --> 547.019
the same aren't you

544.16 --> 550.1
just the new wall artists come back so

547.019 --> 550.1
yeah that's going on

568.8 --> 575.279
stupid gas lighting

571.74 --> 577.86
about how Russia is leaving a trail of

575.279 --> 580.64
Destruction that kind of [ __ ]

577.86 --> 583.74
from the EU

580.64 --> 587.31
bureaucrat puppets nobody's buying it

583.74 --> 590.36
like just nobody's buying it

587.31 --> 590.3599999999999
[Music]

590.7 --> 593.12
right

593.22 --> 596.779
hey LSG good to see you

596.82 --> 601.46
[Music]

603.95 --> 615.74
[Music]

611.279 --> 615.74
uh-huh that's hilarious dank

615.899 --> 623.22
can you imagine that

619.019 --> 625.68
okay I mean seriously like in the United

623.22 --> 627.9590000000001
States killing the welfare

625.68 --> 630.12
especially in those [ __ ] up cities

627.959 --> 633.8599999999999
dude

630.12 --> 633.86
I mean that's gonna be like

634.14 --> 638.399
that's gonna be like a civil war from

636.66 --> 640.68
all those people that are just gonna

638.399 --> 644.7
like

640.68 --> 646.8
just start attacking and looting things

644.7 --> 649.399
as far as they haven't already been

646.8 --> 649.399
doing that

651.06 --> 655.1999999999999
what is it gonna take I don't think

652.56 --> 657.06
anything is going to take it like I mean

655.2 --> 658.6800000000001
I think America's just gonna take it and

657.06 --> 660.3599999999999
they're just gonna take everything and

658.68 --> 661.56
they're just gonna keep Grand standing

660.36 --> 664.38
and

661.56 --> 667.04
feeling also cure with their stockpiles

664.38 --> 667.04
and all that

667.32 --> 672.96
or not getting [ __ ] over and then

669.6 --> 680.279
ending up on the streets

672.96 --> 682.2
[Music]

680.279 --> 685.38
I think that

682.2 --> 688.0790000000001
the what is it gonna take stages

685.38 --> 691.56
kind of past bank I don't think

688.079 --> 693.7199999999999
Americans are gonna do anything

691.56 --> 696.3
and yeah although

693.72 --> 698.779
there might be like more people that are

696.3 --> 702.5
just gonna be like okay we're the local

698.779 --> 702.5
guards are sounded

703.74 --> 708.86
so I'm sure that like smaller towns and

706.5 --> 708.86
all that

708.959 --> 713.579
that they're probably gonna be

711.24 --> 717.62
relatively safe

713.579 --> 717.62
from any chaos out there

718.2 --> 722.7
but yeah

720.899 --> 725.459
yeah nobody's actually gonna do it

722.7 --> 728.94
nobody's gonna move into the

725.459 --> 731.16
the Mayors and police Chiefs and all

728.94 --> 734.1300000000001
that [ __ ] that I recommended nobody

731.16 --> 737.1899999999999
gives a [ __ ] nobody's gonna do anything

734.13 --> 737.1899999999999
[Music]

739.98 --> 744.779
I think the overall American strategy is

742.44 --> 747.6
just let it all die I think that that's

744.779 --> 751.5
the overall strategy

747.6 --> 755.64
just let everything die everything

751.5 --> 757.14
and you waited the last one standing I

755.64 --> 758.64
think that's the strategy and I think

757.14 --> 761.04
that's what's going to keep playing out

758.64 --> 762.48
no matter what happens literally no

761.04 --> 767.0
matter what

762.48 --> 767.0
no matter how many cities get burned

767.519 --> 773.54
no many no matter how many people get

770.639 --> 773.54
just

773.72 --> 777.4200000000001
assassinated and playing daylight on the

776.279 --> 780.959
street

777.42 --> 784.56
by thugs like I don't think

780.959 --> 786.0189999999999
there is any level to which like it's

784.56 --> 789.66
going to

786.019 --> 791.94
trigger Americans into action I don't

789.66 --> 794.399
think there is any limit I think it'll

791.94 --> 796.9200000000001
literally be let everything die

794.399 --> 799.019
literal hell on Earth and they'll all

796.92 --> 802.5
just sit there

799.019 --> 804.3
on their stockpiles and that's it I

802.5 --> 804.89
think that's all that's ever gonna

804.3 --> 810.3199999999999
happen

804.89 --> 810.3199999999999

1131.78 --> 1136.78

of those

1137.419 --> 1142.1000000000001
I think that most of those typical

1139.76 --> 1144.08
Russian families that did get kicked out

1142.1 --> 1146.8999999999999
they all moved to Russia what happened

1144.08 --> 1149.539
they all moved to the United States

1146.9 --> 1151.8200000000002
[Music]

1149.539 --> 1154.039
like

1151.82 --> 1155.1789999999999
Robin Stanley hasn't been around for a

1154.039 --> 1159.52
while

1155.179 --> 1159.52
it was like a curator in a museum

1160.28 --> 1166.3999999999999
that was in a town that was like mostly

1163.24 --> 1170.679
Russian families

1166.4 --> 1170.679
that had all been kicked out of Russia

1170.78 --> 1174.74
during that time so the United States is

1173.48 --> 1180.959
full of those

1174.74 --> 1180.959
[Music]

1183.2 --> 1187.22
right and not all of them are like

1187.22 --> 1193.1000000000001
creepy and [ __ ] at all

1190.82 --> 1196.36

1193.1 --> 1196.36
of the Communist Revolution

1196.88 --> 1199.46
yeah

1197.74 --> 1201.38
[Music]

1199.46 --> 1203.679
but yeah that doesn't mean that some of

1201.38 --> 1207.7990000000002
them will actually

1203.679 --> 1211.48
fall back into their old ways

1207.799 --> 1211.48
as you could call it

1217.55 --> 1222.1889999999999
[Music]

state

1267.62 --> 1272.9189999999999
apparatus

1269.96 --> 1272.919
he's part of that

1273.98 --> 1278.6
because I mean being part or connected

1276.44 --> 1280.46
in Government doesn't necessarily have

1278.6 --> 1283.58
to be bad

1280.46 --> 1285.72

black magic wizard

1363.08 --> 1368.62

1365.84 --> 1368.62

he's like a Kabbalah guy or whatever

1379.34 --> 1381.82

1392.559 --> 1398.44
I guess then occult it was better picked

1403.1 --> 1406.9599999999998
it's just really weird like

1409.039 --> 1416.12

1608.0 --> 1610.84
okay

1612.679 --> 1617.6000000000001

1937.46 --> 1940.72

that looks like a Ram's Horn

1998.679 --> 2005.3200000000002
like a metal made one

2012.82 --> 2016.3799999999999

somebody probably made an airplane in

2367.54 --> 2374.02
I don't like continually repeating

2369.76 --> 2375.7000000000003
myself but hey if people have questions

2374.02 --> 2377.859
or they think they have arguments

2375.7 --> 2382.14
against us

2377.859 --> 2382.14
then I can definitely respond to that

2382.3 --> 2389.619
and sometimes I have like Curiosities

2386.5 --> 2392.76
and conceptual ideas about Flat Earth

2389.619 --> 2392.76

list what okay

2414.88 --> 2418.32
that's very odd

2423.94 --> 2429.94
but you thought that way Flat Earth

2427.06 --> 2431.859
early bird you thought that style stood

2429.94 --> 2433.66
out so much that you actually clicked it

2431.859 --> 2436.2
it's like you wanted to know what the

2433.66 --> 2436.2
hell is this

2437.02 --> 2439.74
that's good

2441.46 --> 2446.26
Earth is supposed to be round

2444.4 --> 2449.02
well that's what they like you to think

2446.26 --> 2451.42
gamer guy

2449.02 --> 2454.32
and I mean there's definitely a lot of

2451.42 --> 2457.1800000000003
like psychological reinforcement through

2454.32 --> 2460.96
media production

2457.18 --> 2465.7799999999997
right they show you a globe

2460.96 --> 2465.78
every time you see a new the news

2466.119 --> 2471.099
they teach you about globe in school

2468.42 --> 2475.839
there's every

2471.099 --> 2479.26
big movie company of old starts their

2475.839 --> 2482.44
movie or their company logo basically on

2479.26 --> 2484.3590000000004
a globe right that sort of thing

2482.44 --> 2487.359
so yeah there's a lot of psychological

2484.359 --> 2490.74
reinforcement of that notion but there's

2487.359 --> 2490.74
no actual proof though

2497.32 --> 2503.1400000000003
all right and even any high altitude

2500.32 --> 2506.26
footage that they're going to show you

2503.14 --> 2508.66
that and then tell you like oh see you

2506.26 --> 2511.599
can see the curve at the distance well

2508.66 --> 2513.7599999999998
that's fisheye lens every single time

2511.599 --> 2516.3
every single time that's like a natural

2513.76 --> 2516.3
camera

2516.7 --> 2522.64
that is actually designed to be broader

2520.3 --> 2525.28
in view

2522.64 --> 2528.8199999999997
but guess what when you turn a fisheye

2525.28 --> 2532.48
lens camera not dead reckoning at the

2528.82 --> 2533.46
Horizon but slightly downward guess what

2532.48 --> 2539.7400000000002
it does

2533.46 --> 2541.7200000000003
it bends it all into a sphere like shape

2539.74 --> 2546.04
that's what happens with the fisheye

2541.72 --> 2547.8999999999996
lens when you bend it slightly downward

2546.04 --> 2551.079
and that's the trick that they keep

2547.9 --> 2553.06
using every single time

2551.079 --> 2555.78
if they're not just straight out doing

2553.06 --> 2555.7799999999997
CGI

2564.7 --> 2569.2599999999998
the Earth is actually really flat it

satanic in origin

2576.64 --> 2581.02
it's a cult

2578.14 --> 2583.9
Edward actually came forth from the

2581.02 --> 2585.88
Catholic Church who created it and then

2583.9 --> 2588.46
pretended

2585.88 --> 2590.8
like they were a Grassroots Uprising

2588.46 --> 2593.02
among them and they had to fight off the

2590.8 --> 2596.619
rest of the church no no no they were

2593.02 --> 2600.28
the the new players in town that were

2596.619 --> 2602.7400000000002
being forced through using the theocracy

2600.28 --> 2604.9
that was there back then with the

2602.74 --> 2607.66
Catholic Church they had all the power

2604.9 --> 2609.9
and these were the Wizards that were

2607.66 --> 2614.0789999999997
gonna recreate

2609.9 --> 2616.1800000000003
a new world a scientific world

2614.079 --> 2619.3
Catholic Church did that they created

2616.18 --> 2620.98
that it never really caught on until the

2619.3 --> 2623.26
20th century

2620.98 --> 2625.48
because even like the 19th century has

2623.26 --> 2627.94
newspapers where there were like

2625.48 --> 2629.92
bickering and debating about people

2627.94 --> 2633.4
claiming the Earth was a globe and then

2629.92 --> 2636.46
people proving the proving against it

2633.4 --> 2638.319
like there was in newspapers in the 19th

2636.46 --> 2641.8
century okay

2638.319 --> 2644.859
so yeah oh we did not always know it was

2641.8 --> 2646.42
a glow for 500 years is a [ __ ] myth

2644.859 --> 2649.359

2646.42 --> 2651.64
it's a bluff it's a bluff that that

2649.359 --> 2654.16
Globe Believers like to say to basically

2651.64 --> 2655.359
silence their opponents because it's all

2654.16 --> 2658.2999999999997
lies

2655.359 --> 2660.2799999999997
yeah the real globe wasn't even enforced

2658.3 --> 2663.04
at the beginning of the 20th century

2660.28 --> 2666.4
they started doing that

2663.04 --> 2669.099
after World War II

2666.4 --> 2672.099
that's when they started doing that and

2669.099 --> 2675.04
then NASA came along and put the cherry

2672.099 --> 2677.7400000000002
on top to prove that a person walked on

2675.04 --> 2680.38
the moon to really enforce that that's

2677.74 --> 2683.0789999999997
actually a place you can go to

2680.38 --> 2688.319
that proves the Earth is a globe right

2683.079 --> 2688.319
next to it yeah that's all 20th century

2689.8 --> 2695.079
the Earth isn't actually a globe the

2692.56 --> 2698.2599999999998
moon isn't a globe either

2695.079 --> 2700.3
it's not even a physical place it's a

2698.26 --> 2701.6800000000003
light in the sky that you can never

2700.3 --> 2704.5
reach

2701.68 --> 2708.0989999999997
you can never fly towards that sighting

2704.5 --> 2712.66
keep flying straight at it and then see

2708.099 --> 2716.2000000000003
the angular size of it increase as you

2712.66 --> 2718.96
should when you know you're approaching

2716.2 --> 2720.819
a physical object so guess what that

2718.96 --> 2723.579
never happens ever

2720.819 --> 2726.7
and here is another mind Bender the same

2723.579 --> 2729.099
goes for the freaking Sun

2726.7 --> 2730.7799999999997
the sun isn't an object either and

2729.099 --> 2733.2400000000002
that's even a bigger mystery because

2730.78 --> 2736.119
there's definitely a lot of light and

2733.24 --> 2738.64
energy arriving here but it's not coming

2736.119 --> 2741.28
from a thing

2738.64 --> 2743.44
it just seems to be manifesting and

2741.28 --> 2746.26
that's why I say

2743.44 --> 2748.599
or I describe all the celestial lights

2746.26 --> 2751.2400000000002
as non-local Holograms

2748.599 --> 2753.04
not everybody seems to be easier to

2751.24 --> 2755.02
agree with me on that

2753.04 --> 2758.079
there's a lot of physicality assumption

2755.02 --> 2760.119
bias going around with people insisting

2758.079 --> 2763.3590000000004
no I'm seeing it so it must be a

2760.119 --> 2766.9
physical thing and if in an actual place

2763.359 --> 2769.119
when there's no proof for that at all

2766.9 --> 2771.359
so yeah there's been some stuff going

2769.119 --> 2771.359
around

2785.68 --> 2791.16
right seems like you're getting the gist

2787.599 --> 2791.1600000000003
of it gamer guy

2799.619 --> 2804.819
more than likely a sock no not

2802.839 --> 2806.02
necessarily but even if they were then

2804.819 --> 2808.8
whatever

2806.02 --> 2808.8
hmm

2810.4 --> 2814.7200000000003
all right gamer guy just for the record

2812.14 --> 2817.359
if you're really new here and you never

2814.72 --> 2819.52
heard of Flat Earth before

2817.359 --> 2821.859
take it easy

2819.52 --> 2823.599
if it's really the first time you ever

2821.859 --> 2824.74
heard about it you're probably a bit

2823.599 --> 2827.319
shocked

2824.74 --> 2829.4199999999996
I get it that happens it happens when

2827.319 --> 2831.94
people actually figure out like wait

2829.42 --> 2833.6800000000003
it's actually real

2831.94 --> 2836.14
yeah flat earthers aren't those

2833.68 --> 2838.7799999999997
ridiculous archaic idiots

2836.14 --> 2842.2
they have really elaborate arguments

2838.78 --> 2845.0400000000004
that Globe proponents can absolutely not

2842.2 --> 2847.7799999999997
counter without

2845.04 --> 2850.859
egregious doubles speak

2847.78 --> 2854.8
like egregious like in your face

2850.859 --> 2857.02
self-contradiction and just say no no it

2854.8 --> 2859.48
works like that yeah that sort of stuff

2857.02 --> 2862.3
is what we have to deal with facing

2859.48 --> 2865.42
globers on a daily basis

2862.3 --> 2868.42
that's actually how it is

2865.42 --> 2872.7400000000002
because the globe is a religious cult

2868.42 --> 2874.2400000000002
that is Catholic in origin a covert

2872.74 --> 2876.3999999999996
cult

2874.24 --> 2880.6189999999997
that was created

2876.4 --> 2884.92
by the top the Catholic Church which is

2880.619 --> 2888.339
arguably very arguably very satanic

2884.92 --> 2891.88
yeah the Vatican is bad bad news always

2888.339 --> 2896.22
has been they are the like the keepers

2891.88 --> 2896.2200000000003
of Consciousness they erase information

2896.38 --> 2901.42
so that it is like completely lost to

2899.26 --> 2904.2400000000002
the general consciousness

2901.42 --> 2906.04
and then they keep the remnants of it in

2904.24 --> 2907.8999999999996
their secret Library

2906.04 --> 2910.839
like stuff

2907.9 --> 2913.42
that they basically erased out of the

2910.839 --> 2916.619
world yeah they're [ __ ] evil and they

2913.42 --> 2916.619
created this globe

2921.52 --> 2926.68
they designed it

2923.68 --> 2929.14
or arguably it was Lucifer's plan and

2926.68 --> 2934.2599999999998
they helped to create it

2929.14 --> 2934.2599999999998
using astronomers and mathematicians

2934.72 --> 2938.6189999999997
you're just a gamer girl

2937.3 --> 2940.54
what

2938.619 --> 2943.079
then why the hell are you called gamer

2940.54 --> 2943.079
guy

2952.48 --> 2957.599
um

2954.46 --> 2957.599
Hello Johnny

2960.16 --> 2964.54
yeah yeah don't worry gamer guy that's

2962.92 --> 2967.1800000000003
actually a girl which is really weird

2964.54 --> 2968.5
but we're just a little bit paranoid

2967.18 --> 2969.819
here

2968.5 --> 2972.04
because

2969.819 --> 2974.619
we get trolls

2972.04 --> 2977.44
that have been like sticking around for

2974.619 --> 2979.7200000000003
seven years straight and that are just

2977.44 --> 2980.92
looking for an opportunity to get in

2979.72 --> 2983.9199999999996
here and

2980.92 --> 2986.079
and then suddenly latch out and [ __ ] so

2983.92 --> 2988.7200000000003
people are a bit paranoid when it comes

2986.079 --> 2991.8
to new people

2988.72 --> 2994.5989999999997
because there have been many many times

2991.8 --> 2997.1800000000003
over the years where trolls would come

2994.599 --> 2998.619
in pretend to be a new person and

2997.18 --> 3001.7999999999997
they'll do pretty much what you're doing

2998.619 --> 3003.359
and then suddenly like turn into a sick

3001.8 --> 3007.92
bastard

3003.359 --> 3009.48
so excuse us if we're a bit paranoid

3007.92 --> 3011.46
it comes with the territory

3009.48 --> 3015.599
unfortunately there's a lot of people

3011.46 --> 3018.599
that are just are professional haters

3015.599 --> 3021.3590000000004
against Flat Earth and flat earthers

3018.599 --> 3024.6600000000003
they're obsessed and they probably get

3021.359 --> 3027.66
paid for it too which is crazy

3024.66 --> 3027.66
foreign

3030.079 --> 3033.619
great that's cool

3033.839 --> 3038.72
well then stick around

3035.64 --> 3038.72
I'll teach you everything

3043.26 --> 3047.5400000000004
oh ferret them out and [ __ ] Cannon yeah

3047.579 --> 3051.079
it's like a packaging Factory

3053.04 --> 3063.0099999999998
glober in a can

3055.37 --> 3063.0099999999998
[Music]

3063.839 --> 3069.66
and it's not like we have to like have

3066.18 --> 3072.0589999999997
steady delivery of globers I mean the

3069.66 --> 3073.859
globers they just like they're very hard

3072.059 --> 3076.7400000000002
to keep up

3073.859 --> 3081.38
they will make hundreds of sock accounts

3076.74 --> 3081.3799999999997
just to be able to get in my face

3083.46 --> 3088.02
fortunately I'm very very quick with the

3086.28 --> 3092.579
band button

3088.02 --> 3094.2
like I can ban people like eight times

3092.579 --> 3097.2000000000003
as quick as they can make new soccer

3094.2 --> 3099.839
cards and some of them are really quick

3097.2 --> 3101.339
so it's it's a whole keyboard Wars

3099.839 --> 3103.38
sometime

3101.339 --> 3104.27
with the Trolls but not right now it

3103.38 --> 3107.389
seems

3104.27 --> 3107.389
[Music]

3118.859 --> 3121.7599999999998
what do you think

3121.859 --> 3124.7
okay

3130.2 --> 3134.7599999999998
cool

3131.94 --> 3137.46
all right but anyway let me explain you

3134.76 --> 3141.559
since you haven't really figured

3137.46 --> 3141.559
anything about flatter that out yet

3141.72 --> 3144.6189999999997
right so

3145.079 --> 3150.1400000000003
how do we know the Earth is flat and not

3147.66 --> 3150.14
a glow

3152.819 --> 3155.819
well

3154.14 --> 3158.7
one of the

3155.819 --> 3161.099
there's like basically three go-to's and

3158.7 --> 3165.18
the most basic one is

3161.099 --> 3168.42
every time Ballers and even teachers in

3165.18 --> 3172.5589999999997
school will tell you boats go over the

3168.42 --> 3174.48
horizon they go over the curve and then

3172.559 --> 3177.3590000000004
oh I don't see it anymore because the

3174.48 --> 3179.28
curve is blocking it right they say that

3177.359 --> 3182.52
but guess what

3179.28 --> 3186.7200000000003
it's a complete straw man fabrication it

3182.52 --> 3189.359
was a lie it was a intended originally

3186.72 --> 3191.3999999999996
planned lie now the people that now

3189.359 --> 3193.98
around you might say oh boats go over

3191.4 --> 3197.52
the curve they're not lying

3193.98 --> 3201.119
they didn't construct the idea of that

3197.52 --> 3203.579
of a boat goes over the curve no no that

3201.119 --> 3205.859
was an original basically Vatican

3203.579 --> 3209.04
Construction

3205.859 --> 3211.98
where they argue okay we must think of

3209.04 --> 3214.38
the Horizon to be Earth curve because

3211.98 --> 3216.059
that's what you have to have on a bull

3214.38 --> 3218.4
Earth

3216.059 --> 3221.099
but the Horizon is actually an optical

3218.4 --> 3224.52
effect you see what is the Horizon

3221.099 --> 3227.099
really it's it's purely an effect

3224.52 --> 3229.44
what it kind of what is like is you see

3227.099 --> 3232.319
you have a broad view

3229.44 --> 3235.319
close to you and then well everything is

3232.319 --> 3240.66
further away becomes smaller to you and

3235.319 --> 3244.04
then eventually it kind of Falls into

3240.66 --> 3244.04
a disappearing point

3244.44 --> 3249.9
yeah

3246.54 --> 3252.3
that's why things seem to disappear

3249.9 --> 3254.1600000000003
bottom up and then you don't they kind

3252.3 --> 3255.0
of get blurry and [ __ ] and then it's

3254.16 --> 3256.5
gone

3255.0 --> 3258.42
right

3256.5 --> 3261.0
and then you might

3258.42 --> 3262.7400000000002
move up with the camera if you have like

3261.0 --> 3265.38
a drone and then suddenly the things

3262.74 --> 3268.02
that were folded into that Horizon

3265.38 --> 3270.42
suddenly like they become visible

3268.02 --> 3274.079
against like the The Horizon like a book

3270.42 --> 3277.76
just unfolds when you go upward and the

3274.079 --> 3277.76
fold is certainly farther away

3278.94 --> 3284.4
that's the effect of the Horizon it's an

3281.76 --> 3287.76
optical effect it's a side effect of how

3284.4 --> 3291.0
Optics and sight work which is a really

3287.76 --> 3294.2400000000002
complicated elaborate subject to delve

3291.0 --> 3296.579
into but that's their why really The

3294.24 --> 3299.0989999999997
Horizon is and what they wanted needed

3296.579 --> 3300.599
it to be replaced with because that

3299.099 --> 3303.3
works on a flat Earth what I just

3300.599 --> 3306.3590000000004
described right

3303.3 --> 3310.619
they need it people to think of the

3306.359 --> 3314.88
Horizon not as things that pull out of

3310.619 --> 3317.76
sight but as something that moves

3314.88 --> 3320.819
over a curve and then beyond it and

3317.76 --> 3323.8190000000004
that's the reason why you don't see it

3320.819 --> 3326.2799999999997
they suggest that typical effects of

3323.819 --> 3328.02
things disappearing slightly from the

3326.28 --> 3330.599
bottom up when they go into the distance

3328.02 --> 3333.66
that that is because Earth curve is

3330.599 --> 3336.96
blocking it that's what they tell you

3333.66 --> 3339.92
in reality however none of that is the

3336.96 --> 3339.92
case in reality

3340.02 --> 3345.72
you can have

3341.94 --> 3349.98
an incredibly far sight

3345.72 --> 3353.16
at a very low distance to the ground

3349.98 --> 3355.5
so there have been many occasions this

3353.16 --> 3357.7799999999997
is really key this is key for you to

3355.5 --> 3360.54
understand in many occasions where

3357.78 --> 3362.099
people have taken their camera

3360.54 --> 3366.839
put it like

3362.099 --> 3369.8590000000004
one foot or maybe three foot above

3366.839 --> 3373.74
sea level like right on the beach like

3369.859 --> 3377.2799999999997
the the tripod is literally sticking

3373.74 --> 3379.6189999999997
into the sand that's getting water

3377.28 --> 3382.7400000000002
splashed on it right and put in there

3379.619 --> 3385.859
very stable at aiming at the Horizon and

3382.74 --> 3388.2599999999998
then taking pictures or live footage

3385.859 --> 3391.2
and then guess what you see

3388.26 --> 3393.9
the beach in the distance or you see an

3391.2 --> 3395.0989999999997
oil platform

3393.9 --> 3398.339
right

3395.099 --> 3399.3590000000004
and then you take the you take the the

3398.339 --> 3402.0789999999997
map

3399.359 --> 3402.0789999999997
of everything

3402.599 --> 3407.2200000000003
right you did you take the map and you

3404.46 --> 3409.98
look up hey where is this beach that I'm

3407.22 --> 3412.4399999999996
seeing oh where is this oil platform and

3409.98 --> 3414.48
then you take a look where you are at

3412.44 --> 3416.4
and then you calculate the distance and

3414.48 --> 3417.839
see like oh it's that far away what I'm

3416.4 --> 3420.9
seeing

3417.839 --> 3424.68
well if you do this and you do it at

3420.9 --> 3425.64
like one foot height one foot above the

3424.68 --> 3428.2999999999997
sea

3425.64 --> 3431.04
and you see something that is let's say

3428.3 --> 3432.3590000000004
five six miles away

3431.04 --> 3434.4
right

3432.359 --> 3436.92
at the Horizon and you still see it

3434.4 --> 3439.14
stick at five six miles when you're at

3436.92 --> 3443.16
one foot observation height with a

3439.14 --> 3445.92
camera at that distance well guess what

3443.16 --> 3449.46
if the Earth were a globe

3445.92 --> 3451.88
you would never ever be able to see

3449.46 --> 3451.88
anything

3452.579 --> 3458.099
at that observation height because the

3455.339 --> 3460.2599999999998
curve of Earth would always block it

3458.099 --> 3463.26
it's a geometric blockage that would

3460.26 --> 3465.599
have to be there if you really believe

3463.26 --> 3471.42
the Earth is a globe but it never

3465.599 --> 3473.4
happens you can see things at fast fast

3471.42 --> 3475.6800000000003
distances

3473.4 --> 3478.559
there's been even like hundreds of

3475.68 --> 3480.0
kilometers it would be slightly higher

3478.559 --> 3481.619
though it's not like one foot

3480.0 --> 3483.66
observation right that never reaches

3481.619 --> 3487.319
that far

3483.66 --> 3490.2
but there's been huge distance sightings

3487.319 --> 3494.22
at very low observation Heights which

3490.2 --> 3496.5589999999997
are absolutely impossible on the globe

3494.22 --> 3499.0789999999997
yet it happens all over the place now

3496.559 --> 3502.1400000000003
there is an there's a name tied into

3499.079 --> 3504.42
this phenomenon this thing that we've

3502.14 --> 3505.7999999999997
keep discovering and we call that a

3504.42 --> 3509.76
Black Swan

3505.8 --> 3512.3390000000004
Black Swan is an argument type

3509.76 --> 3515.76
that is uh

3512.339 --> 3518.04
it's a and Carl popper analogies like

3515.76 --> 3520.1400000000003
old

3518.04 --> 3522.38
science and debating

3520.14 --> 3524.5789999999997
so this is like classical

3522.38 --> 3526.559
teachings like that you get at

3524.579 --> 3532.1400000000003
University and all that actual debating

3526.559 --> 3534.599
right and Carl popper analogy is that

3532.14 --> 3537.0789999999997
there was somebody that said all swans

3534.599 --> 3537.079
are white

3537.299 --> 3541.799
because in that country where Carl

3539.94 --> 3544.2000000000003
popper and his colleagues lived all

3541.799 --> 3545.64
swans were white but Carl popper had

3544.2 --> 3549.54
heard

3545.64 --> 3552.1189999999997
from a colleague who traveled south

3549.54 --> 3554.16
and East very far that there were also

3552.119 --> 3556.44
black swans there

3554.16 --> 3558.7799999999997
but the guy I didn't believe it it said

3556.44 --> 3561.119
no all swans are white so Carl popper

3558.78 --> 3563.52
then said okay I'm gonna prove you wrong

3561.119 --> 3567.059
you traveled abroad

3563.52 --> 3569.4
and then he found a Black Swan kept it

3567.059 --> 3571.8590000000004
alive transported it all the way back

3569.4 --> 3574.799
and here you go not all swans are white

3571.859 --> 3576.7799999999997
Black Swan you were wrong and there's

3574.799 --> 3578.94
nothing you can do now to prove yourself

3576.78 --> 3582.2400000000002
right because here is the ultimate

3578.94 --> 3585.78
exception here's a Black Swan not all

3582.24 --> 3588.5989999999997
swans are right you're incorrect sir

3585.78 --> 3589.7400000000002
that's the Black Swan argument well that

3588.599 --> 3591.96
same

3589.74 --> 3594.66
setup

3591.96 --> 3598.799
is very applicable

3594.66 --> 3603.18
to the ball Earth and Flat Earth because

3598.799 --> 3606.059
if you violate optically the geometry of

3603.18 --> 3608.64
the sphere Earth that means you can see

3606.059 --> 3611.3390000000004
too far at too low in observation height

3608.64 --> 3613.2
and you can still see things in the

3611.339 --> 3615.0
distance very distinctly when they

3613.2 --> 3617.7599999999998
should be completely out of sight

3615.0 --> 3620.579
completely behind the curve at that

3617.76 --> 3623.099
observation height well guess what Black

3620.579 --> 3625.5
Swan that should never be able to happen

3623.099 --> 3628.319
it's a violation of the spherical

3625.5 --> 3630.059
geometry you can see it and it should

3628.319 --> 3632.7
never be seeable

3630.059 --> 3635.579
on the globe and so that's the Black

3632.7 --> 3637.68
Swan analogy

3635.579 --> 3639.599
that's the Black Swan argument

3637.68 --> 3641.46
the Earth is definitely not a globe

3639.599 --> 3643.619
because if it were then you would never

3641.46 --> 3646.619
be able to see things

3643.619 --> 3649.2000000000003
at that vast distance at that low an

3646.619 --> 3650.2200000000003
observation height and we do so all the

3649.2 --> 3653.339
time

3650.22 --> 3655.5
many many flat earthers have gone out

3653.339 --> 3658.14
there with their p900s and other cameras

3655.5 --> 3660.42
and captured these Black Swan

3658.14 --> 3663.0
photographs like oh look I see this

3660.42 --> 3666.66
thing that's like kilometers away and

3663.0 --> 3669.599
I'm like one one meter from the ground

3666.66 --> 3671.7599999999998
that's impossible on the glow Black Swan

3669.599 --> 3675.0
right that's what we keep doing so

3671.76 --> 3678.3590000000004
that's one that's one part

3675.0 --> 3680.339
now we get to the second big argument

3678.359 --> 3684.54
and that is

3680.339 --> 3687.18
natural law within physics

3684.54 --> 3689.94
yeah there's natural laws one of those

3687.18 --> 3692.8799999999997
natural laws which means it happens

3689.94 --> 3695.46
always and it can never be demonstrated

3692.88 --> 3697.02
to be not happening and one of these

3695.46 --> 3698.64
laws is called the second law of

3697.02 --> 3701.22
Thermodynamics and the second law of

3698.64 --> 3704.04
thermodynamic States a lot of things but

3701.22 --> 3707.359
one very important thing about it is

3704.04 --> 3707.359
that gas pressure

3707.76 --> 3712.7990000000004
always

3709.319 --> 3715.799
I guess always presses and it always

3712.799 --> 3718.92
moves from high pressure to low pressure

3715.799 --> 3721.44
within the available volume

3718.92 --> 3724.98
yeah well guess what

3721.44 --> 3727.799
the globe religion the globe Earth

3724.98 --> 3730.02
cosmology and you all know about your

3727.799 --> 3732.42
offseed Neil deGrasse Tyson on the

3730.02 --> 3734.94
History Channel and all that [ __ ] all of

3732.42 --> 3736.799
you have all your newcomers every single

3734.94 --> 3739.44
one I did I used to watch that all the

3736.799 --> 3741.24
time I loved it yeah they all suggest

3739.44 --> 3743.88
that the Earth

3741.24 --> 3746.16
it's right here and we have this lovely

3743.88 --> 3748.319
yummy gas pressure that we breathe all

3746.16 --> 3752.2799999999997
day long right the life exists because

3748.319 --> 3755.7
of that but then they suggest that you

3752.28 --> 3758.94
go further up you go away from the ball

3755.7 --> 3760.859
Earth into outer space and suddenly

3758.94 --> 3763.2000000000003
oh you have to have your astronaut

3760.859 --> 3765.24
helmet on or you're gonna choke and then

3763.2 --> 3766.68
you're gonna freeze and your eyeballs

3765.24 --> 3768.7799999999997
are going to shatter blah blah blah

3766.68 --> 3769.68
right yeah yeah you know why that

3768.78 --> 3772.079
happens

3769.68 --> 3774.5989999999997
because nature of course a vacuum and

3772.079 --> 3777.42
everything that is going to be in a

3774.599 --> 3781.619
vacuum is gonna die

3777.42 --> 3783.78
because liquids will evaporate

3781.619 --> 3786.42
or freeze

3783.78 --> 3788.52
and gas is all going to move away so

3786.42 --> 3790.44
everything chokes right that's the

3788.52 --> 3792.299
hazard of vacuum we've seen it in in

3790.44 --> 3793.64
space movies all the time like oh my God

3792.299 --> 3797.64
I got a liquor

3793.64 --> 3799.5
I'm joking right yeah this vacuum of

3797.64 --> 3802.44
space it's so dangerous well guess what

3799.5 --> 3806.52
that vacuum of space is suggested to be

3802.44 --> 3810.54
sitting right next to the pressurized

3806.52 --> 3814.02
gas pressure World breathing ball Earth

3810.54 --> 3816.48
without any barrier to prevent all this

3814.02 --> 3819.059
gas pressure here on Earth to

3816.48 --> 3822.119
immediately boom

3819.059 --> 3824.2200000000003
move into that vacuum to try and even

3822.119 --> 3826.26
out the gas pressure because gas

3824.22 --> 3829.3799999999997
pressure moves from high pressure to low

3826.26 --> 3831.8390000000004
pressure to try and even out

3829.38 --> 3834.359
the pressure within the available volume

3831.839 --> 3837.599
of the container

3834.359 --> 3840.66
but the heliocentric model

3837.599 --> 3842.7000000000003
religion says

3840.66 --> 3846.859
that it the gas pressure is just sitting

3842.7 --> 3850.9199999999996
on a bowl next to an endless volume of

3846.859 --> 3855.119
absolutely no pressure whatsoever

3850.92 --> 3859.26
like insane vacuums they say is are

3855.119 --> 3862.44
there that we can't even create using

3859.26 --> 3865.5
Machinery we can't even create the level

3862.44 --> 3871.04
of vacuum

3865.5 --> 3874.98
that they claim is naturally passively

3871.04 --> 3877.799
out there in outer space it's completely

3874.98 --> 3881.099
insane yeah

3877.799 --> 3885.48
you can't have gas pressure without a

3881.099 --> 3887.819
container to help the gas pressurize

3885.48 --> 3891.0
you see gas pressure requires a

3887.819 --> 3894.02
container to do that but if we're up on

3891.0 --> 3897.42
a ball with all this gas here in an

3894.02 --> 3900.18
endless Outer Space Universe volume with

3897.42 --> 3903.299
absolutely no pressure whatsoever well

3900.18 --> 3905.819
then natural law would always always

3903.299 --> 3908.94
that's why it's natural law

3905.819 --> 3912.359
dictate that the gas would immediately

3908.94 --> 3915.079
disperse and try to even out with the

3912.359 --> 3915.0789999999997
available volume

3915.18 --> 3919.5589999999997
because that's what gas does it does it

3917.819 --> 3922.319
always it's natural law it's the second

3919.559 --> 3927.299
law of Thermodynamics so

3922.319 --> 3929.94
Earth obviously isn't a ball in a giant

3927.299 --> 3933.359
space vacuum because we have gas

3929.94 --> 3936.68
pressure which means there has to be a

3933.359 --> 3936.68
limited available volume

3937.079 --> 3943.2000000000003
which suggests that we live in a realm

3940.619 --> 3946.319
and a realm means

3943.2 --> 3948.96
a container we live in a container we do

3946.319 --> 3951.66
not know the exact dimensions of this

3948.96 --> 3954.42
container but we do know

3951.66 --> 3957.0
it has to be pretty high

3954.42 --> 3959.099
there has to be a barrier there in some

3957.0 --> 3961.079
way now there's some people speculate

3959.099 --> 3962.76
that oh it's a dome it's a spherical

3961.079 --> 3965.819
structure that surrounds us and then

3962.76 --> 3967.92
touches down like Way Beyond the poles

3965.819 --> 3970.319
and we can't get there

3967.92 --> 3972.119
or something we might get there one day

3970.319 --> 3974.339
well I think that's not the only

3972.119 --> 3977.4
solution but

3974.339 --> 3980.04
there is definitely gas pressure so

3977.4 --> 3981.599
there is definitely a limited available

3980.04 --> 3985.079
volume

3981.599 --> 3988.559
for that gas pressure to be able to form

3985.079 --> 3991.7400000000002
and there's definitely not a endless

3988.559 --> 3995.76
amount of volume out there that surround

3991.74 --> 3998.2799999999997
us without a barrier to separate

3995.76 --> 4000.92
this place with all that gas pressure

3998.28 --> 4002.1800000000003
from the outside suggests the giant

4000.92 --> 4005.359
vacuum

4002.18 --> 4010.5789999999997
right so that's the second argument

4005.359 --> 4013.2799999999997
the globe Earth is not a feasible setup

4010.579 --> 4016.46
for gas pressure like that can happen

4013.28 --> 4018.619
they made you believe something that's

4016.46 --> 4021.079
crazy and that is absolutely

4018.619 --> 4022.039
contradictory with natural law within

4021.079 --> 4024.319
physics

4022.039 --> 4026.599
like it can never happen yet they say

4024.319 --> 4029.299
that that is what happens and they don't

4026.599 --> 4031.76
even give proper excuses for it I mean

4029.299 --> 4034.22
ball Believers often do say like yeah

4031.76 --> 4036.6800000000003
but gravity is doing that

4034.22 --> 4038.4199999999996
well ball Believers don't even know what

4036.68 --> 4040.7599999999998
gravity is

4038.42 --> 4042.02
most people don't actually know what

4040.76 --> 4044.599
gravity is

4042.02 --> 4047.96
and to be fair there's no proof that

4044.599 --> 4050.42
gravity actually even is a thing gravity

4047.96 --> 4053.539
is a myth that is intricately tied in

4050.42 --> 4055.46
with the globe cosmology it was a factor

4053.539 --> 4058.5200000000004
that they needed

4055.46 --> 4061.64
to make an excuse as to why material

4058.52 --> 4065.299
would gather together

4061.64 --> 4066.02
into a ball like what we're claimed to

4065.299 --> 4068.9
be

4066.02 --> 4071.18
according to Globe Earth cosmology right

4068.9 --> 4074.619
but gravity

4071.18 --> 4078.2
in every form that it exists is actually

4074.619 --> 4081.079
logically mechanically if it even it

4078.2 --> 4083.96
would be there just by the suggestion of

4081.079 --> 4086.1800000000003
how they say it is and it isn't there

4083.96 --> 4089.539
but even by the suggestion of that like

4086.18 --> 4092.96
even if there I thought of gravity would

4089.539 --> 4095.78
exist and it doesn't if it would it

4092.96 --> 4100.819
would not be mechanically capable

4095.78 --> 4103.88
of counteracting the enormous power of

4100.819 --> 4105.38
gas trying to expand to fill the

4103.88 --> 4107.96
available volume

4105.38 --> 4111.38
because that is like one of the most

4107.96 --> 4113.359
powerful forces in the universe gas

4111.38 --> 4116.54
pressure trying to expand within an

4113.359 --> 4120.319
available volume is extremely explosive

4116.54 --> 4124.1
it's so explosive that well creating a

4120.319 --> 4126.160000000001
really heavy vacuum is extremely hard it

4124.1 --> 4130.6990000000005
requires like

4126.16 --> 4133.639999999999
giant thick concrete walls and

4130.699 --> 4135.04
enormously powerful Motors and it's like

4133.64 --> 4137.6
completely

4135.04 --> 4138.799
completely impossible

4137.6 --> 4141.14
to do

4138.799 --> 4142.699
creating a vacuum is actually really

4141.14 --> 4144.4400000000005
hard

4142.699 --> 4147.08
if you want to have a large volume

4144.44 --> 4150.94
that's evacuated like in a small vacuum

4147.08 --> 4154.96
chamber it's it's easier but

4150.94 --> 4154.96
this big no

4157.59 --> 4160.789
[Music]

4161.179 --> 4164.5
what's going on here

4165.799 --> 4170.44
no [ __ ]

4167.719 --> 4170.44
don't

4171.859 --> 4174.819
what's going on here

4179.42 --> 4184.9400000000005
right well I'm in the middle of

4181.16 --> 4187.5199999999995
explaining so don't bicker with them

4184.94 --> 4190.94
if they're obviously trolls then you

4187.52 --> 4193.160000000001
whatever tell me they're not trolls they

4190.94 --> 4195.44
don't seem to be trolls there might be

4193.16 --> 4200.12
some trolling

4195.44 --> 4202.16
of the new guy whatever the new guy is a

4200.12 --> 4205.34
guy and if he turns out to be a [ __ ]

4202.16 --> 4211.84
troll afterwards to [ __ ] bad then

4205.34 --> 4211.84
okay stop bickering with the new guys

4212.239 --> 4218.12
you hear me I don't care how much you

4215.9 --> 4220.04
know it's a [ __ ] Troll he's not

4218.12 --> 4224.14
acting like a troll

4220.04 --> 4224.14
so stop bickering with him

4226.82 --> 4234.58
I'm trying to have a [ __ ] show here I

4230.3 --> 4234.58
don't need [ __ ] fighting all the time

4239.239 --> 4241.718999999999
right

4241.88 --> 4247.52
so there you go the second argument

4245.659 --> 4249.46
can't have gas pressure without a

4247.52 --> 4253.280000000001
container second law of Thermodynamics

4249.46 --> 4255.92
proves that the conception of a globe

4253.28 --> 4259.28
Earth that has gas pressure on it versus

4255.92 --> 4262.04
an outer space infinite vacuum is

4259.28 --> 4264.44
absolutely impossible

4262.04 --> 4266.0
definite proof that the Earth is not a

4264.44 --> 4268.099999999999
globe in outer space

4266.0 --> 4271.58
right

4268.1 --> 4273.860000000001
then you have more argument but a third

4271.58 --> 4276.08
was very typical would be do all the

4273.86 --> 4277.639999999999
clear the Earth's ball is claimed to be

4276.08 --> 4279.98
spinning

4277.64 --> 4283.159000000001
and that's supposedly the reasons why we

4279.98 --> 4285.86
see these the star Sky spinning around

4283.159 --> 4288.199
us and it's claimed by baller

4285.86 --> 4290.0599999999995
cosmologists that that is because the

4288.199 --> 4292.159
Earth is actually rotating underneath

4290.06 --> 4295.34
all of that and it's the stars that are

4292.159 --> 4299.0
standing still well this is provably

4295.34 --> 4303.02
wrong for multiple reasons

4299.0 --> 4304.64
one of them being there is no parallax

4303.02 --> 4306.1990000000005
uh

4304.64 --> 4309.4400000000005
there's

4306.199 --> 4310.159
why they call it a Taiko Bry I think was

4309.44 --> 4313.099999999999
it

4310.159 --> 4316.82
that measured some stuff

4313.1 --> 4318.56
with the Stars and then figured out like

4316.82 --> 4321.199
because of

4318.56 --> 4325.6990000000005
oh my God this is officially classified

4321.199 --> 4329.178999999999
as experiment it's was it Aries failure

4325.699 --> 4333.08
not Tycho Bry Aries failure

4329.179 --> 4336.1990000000005
you try to test like whether the stars

4333.08 --> 4338.48
are moving around us or whether we are

4336.199 --> 4342.5
moving underneath the stars that are

4338.48 --> 4345.82
standing still he used a like a water

4342.5 --> 4345.82
based telescope

4346.46 --> 4351.26
and yeah and now this is basically where

4348.98 --> 4351.98
my specialty starts lacking a bit you'd

4351.26 --> 4354.26
need

4351.98 --> 4355.5199999999995
somebody else to explain it that's one

4354.26 --> 4357.62
thing

4355.52 --> 4360.1990000000005
we're not moving underneath the Stars

4357.62 --> 4363.5
it's the stars that are moving over us

4360.199 --> 4365.12
provably and then there is the matter of

4363.5 --> 4367.28
Coriolis effect

4365.12 --> 4368.719
you see if the Earth was actually an

4367.28 --> 4370.699
object that's spitting there should be

4368.719 --> 4374.62
all kinds of forces that are subjected

4370.699 --> 4378.379999999999
to things that spin or move

4374.62 --> 4381.62
centripetal forces but above all the

4378.38 --> 4384.7390000000005
deviation right coriolis deviation so

4381.62 --> 4387.98
here's the thing objects

4384.739 --> 4392.299999999999
and solid and liquid material have

4387.98 --> 4395.178999999999
momentum right you throw a stone

4392.3 --> 4397.52
you give it a push and then you let it

4395.179 --> 4399.9800000000005
go and hey guess what the stone keeps

4397.52 --> 4403.400000000001
flying right

4399.98 --> 4405.678999999999
well you can even like take a handful of

4403.4 --> 4409.099999999999
water and then throw it and yeah it'll

4405.679 --> 4412.34
move apart but it will also keep its

4409.1 --> 4416.02
momentum and and move in that direction

4412.34 --> 4416.02
well guess what gas

4416.54 --> 4421.159
doesn't do that gas doesn't have

4419.659 --> 4425.0599999999995
momentum

4421.159 --> 4426.98
what gas does instead is you push you

4425.06 --> 4429.14
push you feel a little pressure on your

4426.98 --> 4431.9
hand don't you when you do that and then

4429.14 --> 4433.46
you feel some really feelings behind you

4431.9 --> 4435.799999999999
your hair is on your back or your hand

4433.46 --> 4438.14
are gonna feel that moving because what

4435.8 --> 4440.1990000000005
happens you create more pressure when

4438.14 --> 4444.34
you move forward in front of your hand

4440.199 --> 4446.54
that pressure immediately tries to

4444.34 --> 4449.659000000001
equalize with its surrounding so it's

4446.54 --> 4452.179
going to move around my hands

4449.659 --> 4455.659
where there's less pressure because I

4452.179 --> 4456.8
just made that Gap there by moving in

4455.659 --> 4459.08
that direction and it's going to

4456.8 --> 4462.38
immediately fill it up

4459.08 --> 4464.96
SO gas doesn't have momentum as soon as

4462.38 --> 4466.58
my stop my hand everything just evens

4464.96 --> 4469.04
out again

4466.58 --> 4470.719
when you move you press forward you

4469.04 --> 4474.56
create local air pressure and a little

4470.719 --> 4475.94
vacuum behind yeah but it doesn't have

4474.56 --> 4478.820000000001
momentum

4475.94 --> 4481.28
so here's the thing if the Earth was a

4478.82 --> 4484.94
ball with all this gas that surrounds us

4481.28 --> 4487.099999999999
right and it's spinning well guess what

4484.94 --> 4490.159
that gas

4487.1 --> 4492.820000000001
is gonna stand still

4490.159 --> 4495.86
as that ball would be spinning

4492.82 --> 4498.219
underneath it yeah

4495.86 --> 4501.259999999999
and guess what's happening in the world

4498.219 --> 4504.679
not that

4501.26 --> 4507.320000000001
yeah because if that would be happening

4504.679 --> 4510.56
then hot air balloons

4507.32 --> 4513.38
would simply lift off

4510.56 --> 4515.42
and then they would stand still as the

4513.38 --> 4519.38
Earth spins underneath them and they

4515.42 --> 4521.54
would in 24 hours be able to LIT in 24

4519.38 --> 4526.1
hours pretty much no matter where they

4521.54 --> 4528.14
are go in a circle around the entire

4526.1 --> 4532.1
world

4528.14 --> 4534.26
and then end up in the same spot yeah

4532.1 --> 4538.42
that's what would happen

4534.26 --> 4538.42
if the Earth were a spinning ball

4538.58 --> 4543.679
because gas doesn't have momentum it

4541.34 --> 4545.84
will just stand still as the Earth is

4543.679 --> 4548.42
spinning underneath it and that isn't

4545.84 --> 4550.64
happening because if you send up a hot

4548.42 --> 4554.36
air balloon or a drone or a helicopter

4550.64 --> 4556.1
it's not immediately Gonna Move off

4554.36 --> 4559.639999999999
because we're the ones spinning

4556.1 --> 4561.8
underneath it no they hang still they

4559.64 --> 4564.1990000000005
hang still air hot air balloons yeah

4561.8 --> 4565.400000000001
they move around a little bit but they

4564.199 --> 4569.0
pretty much

4565.4 --> 4572.659
stay where they are why because the

4569.0 --> 4574.699
Earth isn't spinning underneath the

4572.659 --> 4577.639999999999
Still Standing gas

4574.699 --> 4580.339999999999
there's no coriolis deviation

4577.64 --> 4582.08
it's stationary

4580.34 --> 4583.219
yeah and it's not an extraordinary

4582.08 --> 4586.28
Clinic

4583.219 --> 4589.4
so there's the third one these are the

4586.28 --> 4591.679
main arguments

4589.4 --> 4593.78
now there's more detail

4591.679 --> 4595.52
arguments but they are they get a little

4593.78 --> 4599.0599999999995
bit more difficult

4595.52 --> 4601.280000000001
right so there is something you probably

4599.06 --> 4604.46
heard of it even in school Celestial

4601.28 --> 4606.86
navigation very important right learning

4604.46 --> 4609.5
in in basic history class everybody

4606.86 --> 4611.239
pretty much gets to opt this they don't

4609.5 --> 4613.64
know how it works but they get told

4611.239 --> 4616.759999999999
about it like yeah Celestial navigation

4613.64 --> 4618.62
it revolutionized sea travel because now

4616.76 --> 4620.0
suddenly you didn't need the land

4618.62 --> 4624.14
anymore

4620.0 --> 4627.199
you could use the stars in the sky to

4624.14 --> 4630.4400000000005
coordinate Where You Are

4627.199 --> 4633.919999999999
using a map that requires for knowledge

4630.44 --> 4636.678999999999
of well how the star positions are

4633.92 --> 4638.96
longitude latitude all that

4636.679 --> 4639.9800000000005
and then you can find your way even if

4638.96 --> 4642.02
you

4639.98 --> 4645.44
are completely surrounded by ocean

4642.02 --> 4646.900000000001
because you have the stars as a map well

4645.44 --> 4651.259999999999
guess what

4646.9 --> 4653.299999999999
Celestial navigation only works because

4651.26 --> 4656.719
the Earth is flat

4653.3 --> 4659.320000000001
because if we were actually on a

4656.719 --> 4659.32
spinning ball

4659.659 --> 4663.139999999999
and

4660.98 --> 4667.159
the stars are out there well guess what

4663.14 --> 4669.7390000000005
you could never use the Horizon then you

4667.159 --> 4671.659
wouldn't be able to use the Horizon on

4669.739 --> 4674.36
the ball Earth

4671.659 --> 4675.86
for Celestial navigation which is a

4674.36 --> 4678.08
standard procedure in Celestial

4675.86 --> 4680.54
navigation you take the position of the

4678.08 --> 4682.28
Sun or the star you take the Horizon

4680.54 --> 4685.58
then you

4682.28 --> 4688.159
match it so you get the exact angle

4685.58 --> 4689.96
but guess what if the Horizon would be

4688.159 --> 4694.219
geometric

4689.96 --> 4696.5
then it wouldn't really be in the same

4694.219 --> 4698.84
location there would be dramatic

4696.5 --> 4701.48
deviations it would make Celestial

4698.84 --> 4703.58
navigation completely unstable and

4701.48 --> 4706.718999999999
unreliable

4703.58 --> 4709.88
right in the most basic

4706.719 --> 4711.5
mathematical explanation you need a flat

4709.88 --> 4715.04
Baseline

4711.5 --> 4717.98
for an angle that you require

4715.04 --> 4720.92
in Celestial navigation and on the ball

4717.98 --> 4724.58
you can't get a flat Baseline because

4720.92 --> 4729.08
it's a ball and a ball doesn't have

4724.58 --> 4731.239
flat lines on it and you need that in

4729.08 --> 4733.699
order for Celestial navigation to work

4731.239 --> 4736.218999999999
this is a more complicated Advanced

4733.699 --> 4738.98
argument so I wouldn't recommend using

4736.219 --> 4741.08
this if you're a newbie but it's

4738.98 --> 4743.78
important to take note of

4741.08 --> 4745.5199999999995
this is one of those things there's more

4743.78 --> 4746.92
of them out there but this is a really

4745.52 --> 4751.400000000001
important one

4746.92 --> 4754.6990000000005
Celestial navigation can only work on a

4751.4 --> 4756.98
flat Earth the procedure of the

4754.699 --> 4760.639999999999
navigation the processes that you do

4756.98 --> 4763.459999999999
could not work if you were on a globe

4760.64 --> 4764.360000000001
it can only work because the Earth is

4763.46 --> 4767.38
flat

4764.36 --> 4770.54
people that use Celestial navigation

4767.38 --> 4772.82
no from practical experience that the

4770.54 --> 4775.34
Earth must be flat

4772.82 --> 4778.34
because if it was a ball then Celestial

4775.34 --> 4779.360000000001
navigation couldn't work

4778.34 --> 4781.46
right

4779.36 --> 4783.259999999999
so that's

4781.46 --> 4787.12
that's pretty much it

4783.26 --> 4787.12
for now that's what I can give you

4790.219 --> 4795.02
hope you appreciate that those are like

4792.32 --> 4797.0599999999995
pretty much the the main bulk of the

4795.02 --> 4798.620000000001
arguments of Flat Earth

4797.06 --> 4803.179
and

4798.62 --> 4805.4
there have been no logical rep rebuttals

4803.179 --> 4807.9800000000005
from the from the globe side I mean they

4805.4 --> 4810.44
invent crazy things to try to counter us

4807.98 --> 4812.178999999999
and they ignore

4810.44 --> 4814.58
other things

4812.179 --> 4816.14
like they they say oh second law of

4814.58 --> 4819.739
Thermodynamics doesn't apply to the

4816.14 --> 4821.42
Earth like oh it can have gas pressure

4819.739 --> 4823.759999999999
it's like oh that was natural law is

4821.42 --> 4826.4
wrong right Ballers will say rather say

4823.76 --> 4828.7390000000005
no natural law is wrong than to admit

4826.4 --> 4831.379999999999
that their model cannot happen that it

4828.739 --> 4832.699
can't be like that

4831.38 --> 4835.34
because they're crazy and they're

4832.699 --> 4838.4
religious Fanatics a lot of them

4835.34 --> 4841.04
right and also in response to the Black

4838.4 --> 4842.5
Swan a lot of Ballers love to say oh

4841.04 --> 4846.5
refraction

4842.5 --> 4849.92
which isn't like refraction is an

4846.5 --> 4853.88
invention it's a mathematical invention

4849.92 --> 4856.52
that is really betrayal to the namesake

4853.88 --> 4859.34
which is actual refraction actual

4856.52 --> 4861.400000000001
refraction is usually insignificant and

4859.34 --> 4865.52
it is the slight

4861.4 --> 4867.86
deviation of the light path like of a

4865.52 --> 4870.02
of a line of sight

4867.86 --> 4873.08
there's stuff that can interfere with it

4870.02 --> 4876.1990000000005
like a lot of air a lot of water vapor

4873.08 --> 4879.0199999999995
that gets in between it distorts the

4876.199 --> 4881.36
past light the lights path and then

4879.02 --> 4883.9400000000005
create a refraction it causes things

4881.36 --> 4886.04
like shimmering and blurring and that's

4883.94 --> 4888.199
refraction right and guess what the

4886.04 --> 4890.62
deviation the angular deviation of

4888.199 --> 4894.639999999999
refraction is always

4890.62 --> 4897.98
insignificant it's always a very small

4894.64 --> 4900.7390000000005
percentage of angle

4897.98 --> 4904.159
right now here's the thing when Ballers

4900.739 --> 4905.78
say refraction as a supposed rebuttal to

4904.159 --> 4908.54
the Black Swan argument about the

4905.78 --> 4911.0599999999995
Horizon being too far all that

4908.54 --> 4913.64
well that refraction isn't actually

4911.06 --> 4917.3
refraction it's very

4913.64 --> 4919.820000000001
very let me say that uh

4917.3 --> 4922.159000000001
sneaky it's very sneaky that they say

4919.82 --> 4924.0199999999995
that because when they say refraction as

4922.159 --> 4926.9
a rebuttal to the Black Swan argument

4924.02 --> 4929.6
what they mean is terrestrial refraction

4926.9 --> 4933.44
or also known as standard refraction

4929.6 --> 4936.1990000000005
which is a mathematical fictional

4933.44 --> 4938.96
invention

4936.199 --> 4941.178999999999
their refraction what they think is

4938.96 --> 4944.36
happening

4941.179 --> 4946.28
says that light

4944.36 --> 4950.299999999999
isn't straight

4946.28 --> 4951.679
but that it's actually bending around a

4950.3 --> 4954.14
ball

4951.679 --> 4956.84
they say that the light isn't just like

4954.14 --> 4960.320000000001
slightly insignificantly deviating but

4956.84 --> 4962.54
that it's deviating enormous amounts so

4960.32 --> 4963.86
much that you can literally

4962.54 --> 4967.5199999999995
see

4963.86 --> 4969.0199999999995
around the corner because of terrestrial

4967.52 --> 4972.580000000001
refraction yeah the terrestrial

4969.02 --> 4976.34
refraction formula has the radius value

4972.58 --> 4978.26
of presupposed spherical Earth within

4976.34 --> 4981.32
the mathematics of it

4978.26 --> 4984.5
so they claim that the Horizon basically

4981.32 --> 4987.679
looks so flat it looks so flat because

4984.5 --> 4990.92
terrestrial refraction

4987.679 --> 4992.54
is bending it from the what they think

4990.92 --> 4995.84
is the ball Earth

4992.54 --> 4998.78
into a flat plane visually

4995.84 --> 5001.900000000001
that's what they think refraction is and

4998.78 --> 5004.84
that's what their rebuttal is

5001.9 --> 5009.0
they think that terrestrial refraction

5004.84 --> 5013.4400000000005
bends the actual to them ball Earth

5009.0 --> 5016.239
geometry into an apparent flat plane

5013.44 --> 5018.159
it's really magical thinking when you

5016.239 --> 5020.799999999999
really look at it but that's what they

5018.159 --> 5022.719
say and it's a complete bunk formula

5020.8 --> 5026.26
it's it's a paradox actually because

5022.719 --> 5028.659
they have the very radius value

5026.26 --> 5032.860000000001
of the supposed ball Earth in the

5028.659 --> 5034.78
formula even though you the existence of

5032.86 --> 5037.599999999999
terrestrial refraction would logically

5034.78 --> 5040.36
make it impossible for you to actually

5037.6 --> 5043.2390000000005
measure the radius value

5040.36 --> 5045.94
because the Horizon isn't where it's

5043.239 --> 5048.28
supposed to be anymore it all looks flat

5045.94 --> 5051.58
now or if it all looks flat then how can

5048.28 --> 5054.219
you properly measure the radius of this

5051.58 --> 5055.96
Earth using visuals which is the only

5054.219 --> 5057.52
way you can measure it because the Earth

5055.96 --> 5059.9800000000005
is so big

5057.52 --> 5062.26
it's a paradox

5059.98 --> 5064.239
right but this is really more advanced

5062.26 --> 5066.6
it's not really relevant to newbies to

5064.239 --> 5066.599999999999
know that

5069.76 --> 5073.42
right

5071.5 --> 5076.12
but I get the GS well that's the most

5073.42 --> 5077.62
important part gamer guy I was trying to

5076.12 --> 5080.86
explain it

5077.62 --> 5082.599999999999
in a way like you don't have to feel

5080.86 --> 5084.219
stupid for not knowing all the words and

5082.6 --> 5087.34
that's why I made so much effort to

5084.219 --> 5089.5
really try to describe every single one

5087.34 --> 5092.02
of them but it's a lot it's a lot to

5089.5 --> 5094.06
take in as a new guy I get it

5092.02 --> 5096.540000000001
just

5094.06 --> 5099.52
it takes some time

5096.54 --> 5102.34
just realize the Earth is flat

5099.52 --> 5104.02
it's not a ball and we're like but to

5102.34 --> 5106.719
uphold

5104.02 --> 5108.88
that knowledge of that it is flat brings

5106.719 --> 5111.04
huge struggle with it because there's a

5108.88 --> 5113.7390000000005
whole bunch of people out there in the

5111.04 --> 5116.04
world that are conditioned to go after

5113.739 --> 5118.0599999999995
flat earthers and to hate them and to

5116.04 --> 5120.34
bully them

5118.06 --> 5122.92
so

5120.34 --> 5126.04
keep that in mind if you're going to

5122.92 --> 5128.32
like personally in your own private

5126.04 --> 5129.88
YouTube account or whatever or in your

5128.32 --> 5132.46
own private chat room start talking

5129.88 --> 5135.04
about Flat Earth realize all your

5132.46 --> 5137.8
friends that you had

5135.04 --> 5140.62
some of them will certainly hate you

5137.8 --> 5142.719
forever if you suddenly bring up Flat

5140.62 --> 5147.099999999999
Earth when you've never done that

5142.719 --> 5150.36
yeah I've lost many friends because I

5147.1 --> 5150.360000000001
came out as a flat earther

5150.699 --> 5155.678999999999
that happens so consider it very

5154.36 --> 5158.5
carefully

5155.679 --> 5161.56
be very like

5158.5 --> 5164.32
if you're gonna like you're really into

5161.56 --> 5167.620000000001
Flat Earth well break it carefully break

5164.32 --> 5169.84
it to one person at a time don't just go

5167.62 --> 5173.679
to your friend's Circle and announce I'm

5169.84 --> 5176.679
into Flat Earth now because that friend

5173.679 --> 5180.04
circle is going to [ __ ] blow up

5176.679 --> 5181.9
then if you just do that out of nowhere

5180.04 --> 5183.639
there's going to be many triggered

5181.9 --> 5186.28
reactions it's never going to be the

5183.639 --> 5187.96
same again so be very careful

5186.28 --> 5191.38
Flat Earth

5187.96 --> 5194.02
is a very psychologically challenging

5191.38 --> 5196.179
subject to a lot of people out there

5194.02 --> 5197.679
that then that don't know about it so be

5196.179 --> 5200.139
very careful

5197.679 --> 5202.36
if you're new with this

5200.139 --> 5204.52
yeah and I'm not exaggerating exactly

5202.36 --> 5208.54
blue pill Devolution that it really is

5204.52 --> 5210.9400000000005
that really does happen be very careful

5208.54 --> 5212.32
yeah just because you suddenly know the

5210.94 --> 5214.419999999999
Earth is flat doesn't mean that

5212.32 --> 5217.659
everybody's just gonna go and agree with

5214.42 --> 5219.219
you not at all so be prepared for that

5217.659 --> 5221.62
if you're gonna do that if you're gonna

5219.219 --> 5224.199
come out as a flat earther think about

5221.62 --> 5227.679
it carefully

5224.199 --> 5230.44
I personally would try to learn more

5227.679 --> 5232.6
about it get more used to it see what

5230.44 --> 5236.44
happens out there with flat earthers

5232.6 --> 5238.120000000001
before you choose to actually like yeah

5236.44 --> 5240.638999999999
I'm gonna do this

5238.12 --> 5242.8
by that time you might think like wait

5240.639 --> 5244.54
I'm glad that I didn't do this but it's

5242.8 --> 5246.52
good to know the Earth is flat but I'm

5244.54 --> 5248.56
definitely not gonna talk about Flat

5246.52 --> 5250.96
Earth with people because I've now seen

5248.56 --> 5251.8
how crazy people can get when you do

5250.96 --> 5256.139
that

5251.8 --> 5256.139
be very careful it's very serious

5262.92 --> 5268.139
oh there's a troll

5265.179 --> 5268.139
bye bye

5269.58 --> 5273.3
see that's a troll

5278.32 --> 5283.12
right but this has been a great show I

5280.9 --> 5286.32
really appreciate it gamer guy that you

5283.12 --> 5286.32
uh came over

5286.48 --> 5292.659
and yeah I hope that that has been

5289.6 --> 5295.1990000000005
interesting to you being new with flat

5292.659 --> 5295.199
Earth and all

5305.139 --> 5309.159000000001
yeah and it wasn't it was nice for me

5307.179 --> 5312.159
too to basically go through the basics

5309.159 --> 5314.679
because I can't just go through the

5312.159 --> 5315.82
basics with all these guys that are in

5314.679 --> 5318.46
my chat

5315.82 --> 5321.04
because they all know this [ __ ] we've

5318.46 --> 5325.4800000000005
heard all of this what I just all rolled

5321.04 --> 5328.36
out that's like standard stuff and I'm

5325.48 --> 5330.218999999999
I'm decently able to explain it because

5328.36 --> 5332.199
it can be difficult to explain it

5330.219 --> 5334.84
properly but everybody knows about

5332.199 --> 5337.659
everything that I just talked about

5334.84 --> 5340.06
but yeah if there's a new person that

5337.659 --> 5343.239
that's a really good opportunity a good

5340.06 --> 5345.159000000001
reason and a good motivation to roll it

5343.239 --> 5347.739
out once again so thank you for giving

5345.159 --> 5349.78
me that opportunity and with that I'm

5347.739 --> 5353.379999999999
gonna round out the show which has been

5349.78 --> 5356.679
an actually really positive good show

5353.38 --> 5358.719
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

5356.679 --> 5361.12
like this show if you did then please

5358.719 --> 5363.1
don't forget to rogans it up and if you

5361.12 --> 5365.5
haven't already subscribe to my channel

5363.1 --> 5367.4800000000005
hit the Bell notification so you know

5365.5 --> 5370.179
when I'm going live which is normally

5367.48 --> 5372.218999999999

Amsterdam time in the weekend and please

5372.219 --> 5376.36
also do support me through the PayPal

5374.62 --> 5378.639
and the patreon that'll be much

5376.36 --> 5380.199
appreciated and it can really still use

5378.639 --> 5385.36
the support guys

5380.199 --> 5388.599999999999
so please if anybody could spare some

5385.36 --> 5390.88
some shackles to good old are when I

5388.6 --> 5392.9800000000005
can't really use it yeah being a flat

5390.88 --> 5394.179
earther does not make you rich trust me

5392.98 --> 5396.58
on that

5394.179 --> 5399.6990000000005
but I still need food and all that so

5396.58 --> 5402.82
please support me or somewhere this week

5399.699 --> 5405.5199999999995
still like I really do need it

5402.82 --> 5408.82
right anyway I'll be back tomorrow with

5405.52 --> 5410.56
flat Earth early bird number 1691 on a

5408.82 --> 5412.659
Wednesday and I'm gonna join the Flat

5410.56 --> 5414.639
Earth debates over at Nathan Oakley 1980

5412.659 --> 5417.5199999999995
Channel which is sort of any minute now

5414.639 --> 5422.58
hope to see you there in the chat and

5417.52 --> 5422.580000000001
until the next video keep it flat

5422.94 --> 5432.82
[Music]

5430.92 --> 5435.82
thank you
