for that

105.6 --> 113.65899999999999
both financial and verbal

109.5 --> 113.659
right so the weather today is

114.72 --> 119.939
well one thing that's really standing

116.82 --> 121.979
out is that it seems like the big the

119.939 --> 124.74
wind that has been blowing for quite a

121.979 --> 126.17999999999999
while a half a week is has kind of

124.74 --> 128.34
stopped

126.18 --> 130.619
it's a little bit of a breeze here and

128.34 --> 132.84
there still but it's nothing like it was

130.619 --> 135.3
yesterday

132.84 --> 137.22
that's completely

135.3 --> 141.12
changed how

137.22 --> 143.29
the weather Dynamic works

141.12 --> 146.63
also it became kind of cold

143.29 --> 146.63
[Music]

146.879 --> 152.0
still some blue sky here and there but

150.72 --> 154.56
a lot

152.0 --> 157.62
I had a bit of Summer earlier that was

154.56 --> 160.28
really nice but yeah not anymore

157.62 --> 160.28
okay

163.08 --> 165.56
all right

165.72 --> 168.319
so

169.5 --> 175.019
hello jindali first in chat Supreme

172.26 --> 177.06
knowing Daniel Robles Mike saidunich

175.019 --> 182.76
good to see you all

177.06 --> 182.76
it is Friday the 4th of November 2022

183.36 --> 188.34
yeah I wasn't sure I was gonna actually

185.94 --> 190.379
do a show today because I had a very

188.34 --> 193.5
rough night I

190.379 --> 194.819
and a bad response to the alcohol for

193.5 --> 196.86
some reason

194.819 --> 200.04
and it already started to even show

196.86 --> 202.26000000000002
during the Flat Earth debates I kind of

200.04 --> 204.599
went a bit slurry which was really

202.26 --> 209.76
surprising to me

204.599 --> 212.099
and yeah I had I was just not great this

209.76 --> 213.54
night I thought I was gonna be like

212.099 --> 215.459
really sick

213.54 --> 218.94
had not thrown up

215.459 --> 221.76
but I did get like these weird

218.94 --> 224.64
sweat attacks

221.76 --> 226.44
so maybe this was basically my body

224.64 --> 228.11999999999998
doing another cleanup routine or

226.44 --> 230.34
something

228.12 --> 234.299
because I had to like sleep

230.34 --> 235.86
with a a towel literally in between my

234.299 --> 239.04000000000002
blanket and me

235.86 --> 242.04000000000002
to yeah to absorb the periodic sweating

239.04 --> 243.84
and with that it was doable I mean

242.04 --> 247.2
overall I've had actually pretty good

243.84 --> 249.12
rest despite all that and weirder

247.2 --> 250.98
is that I had

249.12 --> 253.5
very

250.98 --> 256.26
the extensive dreams

253.5 --> 259.04
in between all that and that was really

256.26 --> 259.03999999999996
weird I

262.199 --> 267.12
I think I might have like dream

264.12 --> 271.62
simulated Narnia

267.12 --> 275.18
because it all seemed very familiar

271.62 --> 275.18
I think I meant Aslan

276.62 --> 282.84000000000003
it was really bizarre to experience that

280.139 --> 285.979
because I did not expect that I don't

282.84 --> 285.979
usually dream like that

286.08 --> 290.0
but uh yeah

290.699 --> 296.94
finished watching the Third

294.08 --> 299.21999999999997
Chronicles of Narnia movie

296.94 --> 300.9
and even though the third movie was kind

299.22 --> 302.88000000000005
of messy

300.9 --> 305.12
I still thought it was really good it's

302.88 --> 305.12
like

305.639 --> 309.96000000000004
the first one was the only one that

307.5 --> 313.56
really kind of like

309.96 --> 315.71999999999997
was a bit off but after that second and

313.56 --> 317.28000000000003
the third movie they really built this

315.72 --> 320.22
lore

317.28 --> 322.4
and his history with them and their

320.22 --> 325.139
experience like in the real world versus

322.4 --> 329.15999999999997
well Narnia

325.139 --> 330.479
and yeah so the third movie was actually

329.16 --> 333.06
pretty good

330.479 --> 335.34
although not as inspiring to me as the

333.06 --> 337.68
second one but still pretty good and

335.34 --> 339.0
even like the annoying kid got a really

337.68 --> 342.08
great

339.0 --> 343.74
well Redemption sort of situation thing

342.08 --> 345.96
[Music]

343.74 --> 348.539
which make me really like him afterward

345.96 --> 352.21999999999997
even though he was super annoying but

348.539 --> 352.21999999999997
yeah that's just who he was

352.41 --> 357.86
[Music]

354.419 --> 357.85999999999996
those streets of gold

360.139 --> 363.919
okay good for you

365.94 --> 371.78
no I do have alcohol but I'm always very

368.94 --> 371.78
careful with it

375.3 --> 379.56
it's Lewis stuff well me neither

376.919 --> 381.24
tominoid I'm I've always been a Tolkien

379.56 --> 383.639
guy

381.24 --> 386.52
but

383.639 --> 388.8
well it is known that

386.52 --> 390.62
C.S Lewis and Tolkien hung around

388.8 --> 394.62
together they were in the same book club

390.62 --> 397.68
right and

394.62 --> 400.139
it does show I mean I do I do think that

397.68 --> 401.58
there's a lot of like really

400.139 --> 403.919
it's about

401.58 --> 406.62
about dreams in themselves really that's

403.919 --> 410.0
what Narnia is about

406.62 --> 410.0
it's really interesting

412.5 --> 415.46
in that sense

416.22 --> 420.78000000000003
but I was never a huge fan of it either

418.74 --> 422.40000000000003
that's why it took so long for me to

420.78 --> 424.63899999999995
actually watch the movies in the first

422.4 --> 424.63899999999995
place

436.74 --> 443.18
damn I just really bumped my heart at my

439.38 --> 443.18
head hard this is that sucks

447.419 --> 449.539
okay

451.74 --> 454.88
right anyhow

458.58 --> 465.419
it's in pan in the book

461.58 --> 468.419
there's all cut there's like the entire

465.419 --> 471.419
Greek mythological Pantheon is per like

468.419 --> 475.88
of Pantheon like all the weird animals

471.419 --> 475.88
are pretty much all in there all of it

480.36 --> 485.40000000000003
you might like the black Towers yeah

482.52 --> 489.139
I've seen the Black Tower

485.4 --> 489.13899999999995
I thought it was pretty interesting

489.3 --> 495.139
not not fantastic but interesting

496.5 --> 500.94
anyway

498.16 --> 502.97900000000004
[Music]

500.94 --> 504.479
so yeah I'm still a little wonky so

502.979 --> 507.139
today is probably not going to be the

504.479 --> 510.71999999999997
best show ever but

507.139 --> 513.36
I mean I've had some really heavy good

510.72 --> 517.2
and detailed shows recently so maybe I

513.36 --> 518.289
just kind of deserve a bit of a break

517.2 --> 520.8000000000001
uh

518.289 --> 522.659
[Music]

520.8 --> 525.12
but yeah I'm

522.659 --> 527.519
I'm barely gonna drink anything today so

525.12 --> 530.839
I'll probably be just fully restored

527.519 --> 530.839
tomorrow as usual

534.3 --> 536.8389999999999
but

542.16 --> 546.66
my mom's online I have no idea what

544.62 --> 548.519
you're talking about

546.66 --> 552.1999999999999
look I've never been really a book

548.519 --> 552.2
reader in the first instance so

552.68 --> 559.1999999999999
there might be all kinds of things out

556.08 --> 562.14
there that yeah I'll probably never even

559.2 --> 565.1
bump into it during my lifetime

562.14 --> 565.1
it's all fine

566.63 --> 570.029
[Music]

574.68 --> 577.8299999999999
[Music]

581.339 --> 586.2
right so today's title

583.56 --> 588.5999999999999
the Galaxy axis

586.2 --> 591.12
was yeah it's basically a little bowl

588.6 --> 593.72
with invention

591.12 --> 593.72
right

594.72 --> 599.399
you might have heard me about it earlier

596.82 --> 601.08
or like last month or something on the

599.399 --> 604.44
Flat Earth debates

601.08 --> 607.74
in response to any evidence for actual

604.44 --> 611.36
rotation of the earth-based variety

607.74 --> 611.36
and then my response could be

612.48 --> 619.64
well no but the galaxial axis is

617.339 --> 619.6400000000001
spinning

620.88 --> 625.32
and we're sitting still in between all

623.7 --> 628.2
that

625.32 --> 629.7600000000001
right and that's it that's basically the

628.2 --> 633.0600000000001
joke

629.76 --> 637.16
right also I've been catching up on Owen

633.06 --> 637.16
Benjamin heavy stuff

637.5 --> 641.32
really happy I mean

639.66 --> 643.0799999999999
I'm like

641.32 --> 644.82
[Music]

643.08 --> 645.9590000000001
clustered

644.82 --> 648.779
to it

645.959 --> 652.0189999999999
listening it

648.779 --> 654.779
it's good stuff uh this whole item about

652.019 --> 658.2
this Cohen guy

654.779 --> 662.04
who's a songwriter and like like I'm

658.2 --> 665.1
halfway through that it's really intense

662.04 --> 669.68
and very revealing what a scary guy that

665.1 --> 669.6800000000001
is I mean genuinely scary guy

669.899 --> 678.74
very creepy anyway a flatten the Curve

674.76 --> 678.74
Terry 306 good to see you

690.959 --> 696.5
right so yeah

692.94 --> 696.5
I mean it's

696.779 --> 701.88
open for subjects I don't have anything

699.3 --> 703.74
else to really get into

701.88 --> 707.519
yes to this yesterday's Flat Earth

703.74 --> 710.04
debate did not continue on the point

707.519 --> 712.14
I think it was sufficiently made

710.04 --> 714.06
Nathan had technical difficulties again

712.14 --> 716.16
and therefore the live show basically

714.06 --> 719.579
started an hour later

716.16 --> 722.04
low x 320 could you please uh take care

719.579 --> 725.2399999999999
of that caps don't do that in my chat

722.04 --> 725.24
please thank you

725.279 --> 730.26
but yeah it was fine

727.68 --> 732.12
the show was fine it lasted a bit long

730.26 --> 733.98
and yeah

732.12 --> 738.0600000000001
I basically

733.98 --> 739.99
got a bit tipsy halfway

738.06 --> 741.3
also because well normally

739.99 --> 743.22
[Music]

741.3 --> 745.9799999999999
yeah it's because of the Rhythm like

743.22 --> 748.5600000000001
suddenly it being an hour later and I

745.98 --> 750.3000000000001
had already kind of broke open a beer

748.56 --> 751.8599999999999
the hour before

750.3 --> 755.12
so

751.86 --> 755.12
yeah whatever

756.66 --> 761.519
if I looked into the war Shaw radio mess

759.54 --> 764.519
no why should I be looking into that

761.519 --> 767.12
flatten the Curve

764.519 --> 767.12
foreign

780.54 --> 783.5
anyway

789.42 --> 793.56
I think I was I'm really lucky that I

791.88 --> 797.279
did actually have proper dinner

793.56 --> 801.56
yesterday I mean if I wouldn't have had

797.279 --> 801.56
that I'd probably be pretty sick now

801.959 --> 807.8
I'll be glad that I did just still eat

805.26 --> 807.8
properly

808.019 --> 811.16
chicken broccoli

812.459 --> 817.6199999999999
that's great

815.16 --> 820.1999999999999
although I think that a lot of it is

817.62 --> 823.2
actually now only really starting to

820.2 --> 825.6
digest now that my

823.2 --> 828.0
system is more cleared up it often

825.6 --> 829.5600000000001
happens like that right you eat then it

828.0 --> 832.019
doesn't really digest all that much

829.56 --> 833.88
until your body gets to the point where

832.019 --> 835.079
it's like okay we're ready now to

833.88 --> 838.279
finally

835.079 --> 838.279
process this

839.76 --> 844.3199999999999
I can feel when that happened I

841.62 --> 846.42
literally feel that when my body is like

844.32 --> 849.5400000000001
oh yeah fine we can now start the

846.42 --> 853.92
conveyor belt again let's start rolling

849.54 --> 853.92
that's a very distinct feeling anyway

854.579 --> 858.06
that thing could be heard across the

856.26 --> 860.639
world yeah of course

858.06 --> 862.4399999999999
I mean if it's just a really high radial

860.639 --> 865.019
mask yeah it's gonna

862.44 --> 867.1800000000001
reach everywhere

865.019 --> 869.42
of course

867.18 --> 869.42
foreign

882.88 --> 886.88
[Music]

904.68 --> 909.199
or is there a larger antenna now

913.139 --> 918.64
collapsed in nine it collapsed oh

916.56 --> 920.16
okay

918.64 --> 921.42
[Music]

920.16 --> 923.8389999999999
all right

921.42 --> 923.8389999999999
fine

932.54 --> 939.12
right well look if a radio Master could

936.42 --> 941.699
reach that far then

939.12 --> 944.72
and it collapsed at one point well why

941.699 --> 944.7199999999999
not build another one

954.06 --> 958.5189999999999
right well maybe the time is just not

956.04 --> 958.519
right yet

960.25 --> 963.35
[Music]

989.579 --> 992.579
okay

999.3 --> 1004.959
they didn't know the Earth was a ball or

1001.82 --> 1004.9590000000001
they just didn't care

1008.019 --> 1012.8
it proved the Earth yeah I know flatten

1011.18 --> 1014.66
the curve I mean come on everything

1012.8 --> 1016.16
proves the Earth is flat because it is

1014.66 --> 1019.18
flat

1016.16 --> 1019.18
everything does

1021.019 --> 1023.68
like

1024.14 --> 1029.5400000000002
if you don't go by

1026.78 --> 1033.98
Flat Earth geometry

1029.54 --> 1036.359
then you cannot be a competent architect

1033.98 --> 1037.64
that's just a fact

1036.359 --> 1038.6699999999998
[Music]

1037.64 --> 1044.8390000000002
it just is

1038.67 --> 1044.8390000000002
[Music]

1046.1 --> 1050.98
realtor broadcast communist propaganda

1048.62 --> 1050.9799999999998
okay

demolish it like

can you demonstrate

to my inquiry

1209.179 --> 1213.3400000000001
yeah similar sandpaper

1213.62 --> 1221.08
you gotta prove to me that ions actually

1217.1 --> 1221.08
bounce radio signals

1221.66 --> 1225.799
yeah

1223.7 --> 1228.919
I don't I mean otherwise you could just

1225.799 --> 1232.7
as well say no don't you know that the

1228.919 --> 1234.6200000000001
radio signals bounce off the ozone layer

1232.7 --> 1237.679
yeah

1234.62 --> 1240.7399999999998
if you'd say that it's technically not

1237.679 --> 1242.9
claimed but it's very similar I'll just

1240.74 --> 1244.82
say like oh oh really so where's this

1242.9 --> 1246.3200000000002
ozone layer how does that work how can

1244.82 --> 1247.8799999999999
it be there

1246.32 --> 1251.48
high up

1247.88 --> 1254.6000000000001
surrounded by gases that are much less

1251.48 --> 1256.94
dense how is it staying there

1254.6 --> 1258.62
and then that whole nonsense comes

1256.94 --> 1261.5
rolling out

1258.62 --> 1262.82
and will reveal that there is no ozone

1261.5 --> 1266.24
layer

1262.82 --> 1267.799
and that there is no ionosphere either

1266.24 --> 1270.679
it's just another stupid little

1267.799 --> 1272.66
construct excuse

1270.679 --> 1276.02
right I mean I'm pretty sure that

1272.66 --> 1278.3600000000001
signals will bounce off a flat top that

1276.02 --> 1279.98
we must have because otherwise we

1278.36 --> 1282.4399999999998
wouldn't have gas pressure

1279.98 --> 1286.179
I'm pretty sure if you have signals

1282.44 --> 1286.179
powerful enough it'll bounce off that

1286.299 --> 1292.46
potentially Maybe

1289.28 --> 1295.76
I think it's probably why they say that

1292.46 --> 1296.96
the ionosphere is probably just the

1295.76 --> 1299.86
firmament

1296.96 --> 1299.8600000000001

it's just bouncing around the

oh oh oops

1348.86 --> 1352.76
but uh

1350.36 --> 1354.32
yeah no it just works because there's a

1352.76 --> 1356.48
straight line aside because the Earth is

1354.32 --> 1359.059
flat

1356.48 --> 1361.659
doesn't have the bounce off anything to

1359.059 --> 1361.6589999999999
go over

1488.12 --> 1493.6
yeah yeah I didn't have any teachers

1490.7 --> 1496.5800000000002
either that would try to

1493.6 --> 1500.6
propagandize me

1496.58 --> 1503.36
I mean subjects like these came up under

1500.6 --> 1505.52
the guise of environmentalism

1503.36 --> 1507.74
but when I was in school and that

1505.52 --> 1510.02
happened nobody actually like forced

1507.74 --> 1511.7
everybody or shamed people

1510.02 --> 1513.559
there was none of that going on there

1511.7 --> 1516.559
was like a strict supervision against

1513.559 --> 1518.48
that intense doing that it pretty much

1516.559 --> 1521.78
every school I've been to

1518.48 --> 1525.32
and like the one school I went to

1521.78 --> 1527.059
like right after kindergarten it turned

1525.32 --> 1529.8799999999999
out not to do it that's like the one

1527.059 --> 1532.46
place where they Globe shamed me

1529.88 --> 1534.44
where they where that's the moment where

1532.46 --> 1536.24
it's like oh wow the flight model I want

1534.44 --> 1538.52
to know more about this and then they

1536.24 --> 1541.58
shamed me publicly in in the class and

1538.52 --> 1544.1589999999999
it was like my first day or something

1541.58 --> 1546.9189999999999
and I haven't been like my my parents

1544.159 --> 1548.779
pulled me out of that school

1546.919 --> 1550.94
and no other school that I've been to

1548.779 --> 1553.22
has actually done that like tried to

1550.94 --> 1555.559
shame me with environmentalism

1553.22 --> 1557.72
they would just try to bring awareness

1555.559 --> 1559.3999999999999
about it and like bring it up as a

1557.72 --> 1563.24
subject and see

1559.4 --> 1565.64
like what is it how real is it how

1563.24 --> 1568.34
legitimate is such a danger such things

1565.64 --> 1571.8400000000001
right a public discussion and that's a

1568.34 --> 1571.84
much better way to learn about it

1576.38 --> 1578.38
um

1584.03 --> 1591.02
[Music]

1587.72 --> 1593.659
right but then again that was like in

1591.02 --> 1596.0
the 90s 80s

1593.659 --> 1598.64
times have changed pretty dramatically

1596.0 --> 1601.34
in the west so

1598.64 --> 1603.98
they do definitely now have teachers

1601.34 --> 1606.559
that reckon indoctrinated kids in all

1603.98 --> 1609.22
kinds of ways that wasn't happening when

1606.559 --> 1609.22
I was younger

1609.919 --> 1617.659
that sort of [ __ ] they tried to like

1613.4 --> 1619.76
just pull you in by being all trendy

1617.659 --> 1622.2990000000002
but that would never be like in school

1619.76 --> 1622.299
or anything

1627.02 --> 1633.1399999999999
I think that that is a much more

1629.48 --> 1635.84
sensible way to go about it all I mean

1633.14 --> 1637.94
this like all these indoctrination

1635.84 --> 1640.58
things

1637.94 --> 1642.14
this should not be in school it really

1640.58 --> 1647.079
shouldn't

1642.14 --> 1647.0790000000002
[Music]

1649.58 --> 1654.5
but yeah parents need to guard their

1652.1 --> 1657.1999999999998
children for that they need to be the

1654.5 --> 1660.2
ones that keep an eye out for what the

1657.2 --> 1662.24
teachers do at their school

1660.2 --> 1665.24
and how they treat

1662.24 --> 1667.58
your child so

1665.24 --> 1671.24
it's what my parents did and they pulled

1667.58 --> 1676.039
me out of that one school immediately

1671.24 --> 1676.94
so they had a vision on like what what I

1676.039 --> 1679.22
needed

1676.94 --> 1681.919
and I'm very happy about that I mean my

1679.22 --> 1684.08
parents took great care

1681.919 --> 1686.96
when it came to where I went to school

1684.08 --> 1690.1399999999999
and I always had the choice and they

1686.96 --> 1692.6000000000001
like even at the Waldorf School

1690.14 --> 1694.88
they actually gave me the option to like

1692.6 --> 1696.5
you wanna you wanna go to another school

1694.88 --> 1699.74
when they started to figure out that it

1696.5 --> 1702.74
was getting really bullied and I was no

1699.74 --> 1703.82
I'm gonna win this I'm gonna sit through

1702.74 --> 1706.64
this

1703.82 --> 1710.2
and I'm gonna win this I I kind of

1706.64 --> 1710.2
wanted the challenge right

1716.72 --> 1720.34
so that was such a troublemaker

1733.7 --> 1738.44
yeah I did end up learning a lot on that

1737.059 --> 1741.44
school

1738.44 --> 1743.539
social wise like social communication

1741.44 --> 1745.52
what people what they are what they are

1743.539 --> 1747.86
on the inside people's different beliefs

1745.52 --> 1750.74
there were a lot of different kids there

1747.86 --> 1753.559
with completely different beliefs

1750.74 --> 1757.22
there was no like oh everybody has to be

1753.559 --> 1759.08
religious in this way or that way

1757.22 --> 1762.88
it was very

1759.08 --> 1762.8799999999999
they kept that private

1762.919 --> 1769.3400000000001
that nobody could be pushy about it

1766.88 --> 1771.88
that was not appreciated

1769.34 --> 1771.8799999999999
anyway

1773.659 --> 1777.98
although there was Bible class by the

1776.0 --> 1779.899
way in that school in that welder school

1777.98 --> 1781.82
they did have Bible class

1779.899 --> 1784.2199999999998
you just had to sit through it you

1781.82 --> 1785.72
didn't have to be invested or

1784.22 --> 1789.46
learn about it

1785.72 --> 1789.46
you just had to kind of sit through it

1815.0 --> 1819.14
hey Godzilla good to see you man

1817.39 --> 1821.8600000000001

1828.38 --> 1833.8990000000001
okay get a cool movie so good on you you

1830.84 --> 1837.26
were never forced to

1833.899 --> 1841.1589999999999
to adapt to indoctrination you just

1837.26 --> 1845.059
wanted the indoctrination and hey

1841.159 --> 1848.3600000000001
to a certain degree fair enough so did I

1845.059 --> 1851.4189999999999
I mean in my Walter school I was highly

1848.36 --> 1852.86
frustrated there was no teaching about

1851.419 --> 1854.779
planets

1852.86 --> 1857.1789999999999
and outer space

1854.779 --> 1859.82
in space travel at all there was no

1857.179 --> 1862.22
mention of that they well turned out

1859.82 --> 1864.4399999999998
later didn't believe that and that was

1862.22 --> 1868.64
to be like what

1864.44 --> 1870.8600000000001
like what I was totally shocked by that

1868.64 --> 1874.3400000000001
thought they were crazy for a while but

1870.86 --> 1876.5
then started to feel out like

1874.34 --> 1878.539
holy [ __ ] there is something here

1876.5 --> 1881.0
there's something there

1878.539 --> 1884.059
but I just couldn't let it go I was in

1881.0 --> 1885.799
love with space and I wanted it I wanted

1884.059 --> 1890.36
to do that I

1885.799 --> 1892.899
love the video games with space

1890.36 --> 1892.899
right

1893.539 --> 1896.44
and all that

1899.36 --> 1903.62
and then like later as I became more

1901.7 --> 1906.8600000000001
teenager like I rolled into the space

1903.62 --> 1909.6789999999999
movies and like alien 2 for example like

1906.86 --> 1912.4399999999998
or aliens like wow what a movie

1909.679 --> 1914.8990000000001
Incredible

1912.44 --> 1917.419
so yeah Myspace enthusiasm has been

1914.899 --> 1922.1589999999999
there for quite a long time and it was

1917.419 --> 1925.5800000000002
me I wanted it I wanted that

1922.159 --> 1927.98
and even like as I was a very little kid

1925.58 --> 1931.34
it still fascinated me

1927.98 --> 1934.3600000000001
so I was pulled towards it

1931.34 --> 1934.36
I wanted it

1935.539 --> 1940.009
anyways

1936.99 --> 1940.009
[Music]

1946.58 --> 1951.1999999999998
shoot kids in school be exposed to the

1949.22 --> 1952.58
old fake Globe model if it would be

1951.2 --> 1954.5
Declassified

1952.58 --> 1956.6589999999999
yes

1954.5 --> 1960.08
absolutely

1956.659 --> 1961.22
I mean what better to learn critical

1960.08 --> 1965.08
thinking

1961.22 --> 1969.919
what better way than to show

1965.08 --> 1972.3799999999999
a persistent mistake from the past

1969.919 --> 1973.7
now if you're just going to like roll it

1972.38 --> 1975.2
out like oh we're going to teach you

1973.7 --> 1977.96
about the globe and then have everybody

1975.2 --> 1980.419
like this is real no no I teach them

1977.96 --> 1982.52
well kind of like how I would teach it

1980.419 --> 1984.38
and that is like this is how it worked

1982.52 --> 1986.84
this is how they built it it's not real

1984.38 --> 1989.8400000000001
but this is their game

1986.84 --> 1991.1589999999999
and it is very convincing right so that

1989.84 --> 1994.34
they could

1991.159 --> 1996.7990000000002
learn to appreciate how it works get it

1994.34 --> 1999.799
correct as much as they can

1996.799 --> 2002.5
and see it as a game as a mind game

1999.799 --> 2004.96
which it really is it's just that it's

2002.5 --> 2007.84
being rolled out to some like it's

2004.96 --> 2010.6000000000001
literally real and people buy into that

2007.84 --> 2012.5
that's where it becomes a trick that's

2010.6 --> 2014.019
where it becomes a spell

2012.5 --> 2016.84
[Music]

2014.019 --> 2019.48
but yeah if there's Flat Earth is

2016.84 --> 2021.6399999999999
Declassified officially uh yeah they

2019.48 --> 2023.799
should the curriculum should definitely

2021.64 --> 2025.8990000000001
adapt

2023.799 --> 2027.7
and there's all kinds of ways you can

2025.899 --> 2031.779
keep the globe in there you can keep it

2027.7 --> 2033.5800000000002
in as like a an opportunity for debate

2031.779 --> 2036.88
right that we've even suggested this

2033.58 --> 2041.019
years ago like yeah why not

2036.88 --> 2042.7600000000002
have kids debate Flat Earth versus globe

2041.019 --> 2045.159
in school

2042.76 --> 2046.899
this like a mini Flat Earth debate with

2045.159 --> 2049.54
kids

2046.899 --> 2051.52
on their strict supervision that things

2049.54 --> 2052.359
don't get out of control emotionally and

2051.52 --> 2055.839
Etc

2052.359 --> 2060.2999999999997
right and just have that done so kids

2055.839 --> 2060.2999999999997
can literally experience it first hand

2061.139 --> 2066.52
so they can start to understand what it

2064.48 --> 2069.119
is the philosophical struggle between

2066.52 --> 2069.119
these two

2098.32 --> 2101.98
some say it's the start of the modern

2100.839 --> 2103.839
movement

2101.98 --> 2106.3
oh yeah

2103.839 --> 2108.7599999999998
well I might have even witnessed that a

2106.3 --> 2112.3
bit it's just that

2108.76 --> 2114.28
everybody would be like poo pooing

2112.3 --> 2116.1400000000003
those that would oppose the globe if

2114.28 --> 2118.2400000000002
they actually did their best

2116.14 --> 2120.7
it's like they would be expected to just

2118.24 --> 2122.9799999999996
say dumb Flat Earth arguments so that

2120.7 --> 2125.2
the globe side could like immediately

2122.98 --> 2126.4
roll out all the technical reasons

2125.2 --> 2129.8999999999996
supposedly

2126.4 --> 2129.9

directed at me or anything you want me

2363.46 --> 2369.599
to talk about

2365.859 --> 2369.5989999999997
share my ideas about

2395.98 --> 2402.54
right Aries 106 you asked that question

2398.44 --> 2402.54
anything to expand upon that

2407.68 --> 2413.56
share my ideas about the metaverse

2411.38 --> 2416.56
[Music]

2413.56 --> 2419.68
I mean what's to share it's boring it's

2416.56 --> 2422.56
a waste of time it doesn't work

2419.68 --> 2424.72
when there's like a recession it's

2422.56 --> 2428.0789999999997
stupid it was a bad move

2424.72 --> 2432.16
Zuckerberg should probably not roll it

2428.079 --> 2434.6800000000003
out or waited until the next

2432.16 --> 2437.68
Golden Age moment where things suddenly

2434.68 --> 2440.98
go good financially and people then have

2437.68 --> 2444.22
money to waste on Virtual nonsense

2440.98 --> 2447.22
and he got this wrong totally wrong

2444.22 --> 2448.99
and that's wise yeah he's not doing all

2447.22 --> 2452.24
that great

2448.99 --> 2452.24
[Music]

2452.32 --> 2457.7200000000003
the market

2454.24 --> 2459.8199999999997
so that's my thoughts about that

2457.72 --> 2461.14
I wonder if virtual reality will ever

2459.82 --> 2462.92
take off

2461.14 --> 2465.7599999999998
not on a massive scale

2462.92 --> 2468.4
[Music]

2465.76 --> 2471.0400000000004
I mean it's effectively already taken

2468.4 --> 2473.619
off it's already there's been virtual

2471.04 --> 2476.339
reality projects that have been in there

2473.619 --> 2476.339
for quite a while

2478.48 --> 2484.359
but it's never going to be good enough

2480.7 --> 2488.3999999999996
to like compete with regular just screen

2484.359 --> 2488.4
based games for example

2488.68 --> 2493.8999999999996
thank you

2490.06 --> 2497.98
and yeah there's the issue of

2493.9 --> 2501.64
physical incompatibility you see I would

2497.98 --> 2505.119
never actually get

2501.64 --> 2507.8199999999997
a 3D goggle system why because it

2505.119 --> 2510.88
physically makes me sick

2507.82 --> 2514.1800000000003
and by the way so does even 3D first

2510.88 --> 2516.4
person stuff on screen if I watch it too

2514.18 --> 2520.48
long it literally makes me physically

2516.4 --> 2523.119
nauseated and 3D goggles I tried them a

2520.48 --> 2524.98
couple of times does that much quicker

2523.119 --> 2528.52
much worse

2524.98 --> 2531.76
so it's not going to be for me ever

2528.52 --> 2534.24
I don't even play first person 3D games

2531.76 --> 2534.2400000000002
at all

2536.859 --> 2541.72
I already find it quite challenging now

2539.32 --> 2544.06
that I basically have to watch Minecraft

2541.72 --> 2546.3999999999996
and all that [ __ ] on Nathan's streams

2544.06 --> 2548.38
because that is a 3D

2546.4 --> 2551.56
and now watching that it doesn't

2548.38 --> 2554.46
actually make me sick

2551.56 --> 2554.46
thus far

2556.359 --> 2562.7799999999997
but every 3D thing that I'm gonna watch

2560.32 --> 2564.82
I don't even have to play it myself just

2562.78 --> 2569.079
watching other people play it will also

2564.82 --> 2571.1800000000003
give me that risk of getting nauseated

2569.079 --> 2575.6400000000003
especially if it's really flashy and

2571.18 --> 2575.64
quick and lots of special effects

anyway

[Music]

2589.0 --> 2593.859
virtual reality go yeah but that's look

2591.64 --> 2597.339
virtual reality goggles have more

2593.859 --> 2599.98
applications than just like oh we want

2597.339 --> 2603.22
it to become the new mobile phone super

2599.98 --> 2606.4
popular everybody who has one no

2603.22 --> 2608.7599999999998
there's other things that are kind of

2606.4 --> 2608.76
Handy

2609.64 --> 2614.3799999999997
there's like military applications

2612.52 --> 2618.119
and for which it's already being

2614.38 --> 2618.119
utilized for decades so

2621.64 --> 2624.5989999999997
but it's yeah

2626.25 --> 2631.42
[Music]

2628.18 --> 2633.46
you can't force people like in The

2631.42 --> 2635.56
Matrix right if that's what you're

2633.46 --> 2637.119
afraid of with the 3D goggles that one

2635.56 --> 2638.56
day you'll put them on and then you

2637.119 --> 2640.359
won't be able to take them off and

2638.56 --> 2642.4
before you know it

2640.359 --> 2646.0789999999997
you don't even know who you are anymore

2642.4 --> 2646.079

ew you do Aries 106 wow

2684.819 --> 2693.16
yeah okay so what if it goes wrong

2690.16 --> 2697.18
what if that means you're gonna need to

2693.16 --> 2699.94
take certain drugs just to prevent your

2697.18 --> 2701.5
body from rejecting the implants the

2699.94 --> 2703.18
rest of your life

2701.5 --> 2705.839
you thought about that

2703.18 --> 2705.839
huh

2707.319 --> 2712.949
but you haven't

2708.55 --> 2712.949

2713.819 --> 2719.02
no I don't want to chip implants

2717.46 --> 2722.579
never

2719.02 --> 2722.579
and it's not necessary

2722.92 --> 2729.88
I mean you already have Google Glasses

2725.38 --> 2732.4
that already proves you don't need it

2729.88 --> 2734.5
you don't need a freaking chip in your

2732.4 --> 2737.56
brain it's stupid and it's going to give

2734.5 --> 2741.9
you medical problems that might be

2737.56 --> 2741.9
with you the rest of your life so

2758.74 --> 2764.64
okay everyone I hope you're joking

2760.9 --> 2764.64
because that's really disgusting

2789.339 --> 2796.599
and besides you're technically already

2792.099 --> 2799.319
living in one yeah just look at we got

2796.599 --> 2803.26
there's video calls now

2799.319 --> 2805.92
standard video calls I mean

2803.26 --> 2805.92
hello

2807.099 --> 2812.44
no that's not good enough that we're all

2809.8 --> 2814.7200000000003
connected technologically and constantly

2812.44 --> 2816.28
everywhere oh no you need a chip in your

2814.72 --> 2819.7599999999998
brain you need to be

2816.28 --> 2821.2000000000003
unable to disconnect from those screens

2819.76 --> 2826.44
do you

2821.2 --> 2826.4399999999996
what a dumb idea Ares 106 really

2832.839 --> 2837.7
different people different preferences

2835.72 --> 2839.9199999999996
yeah

2837.7 --> 2842.14
the mine are based on long-term

2839.92 --> 2845.04

it's not interesting

2909.88 --> 2914.079
it does is it's gonna give you a novelty

2912.579 --> 2915.4
you're gonna feel special and then

2914.079 --> 2917.5600000000004
enough that he's going to wear off and

2915.4 --> 2921.28
then you're in [ __ ] hell

2917.56 --> 2925.66
yeah that's the reality

2921.28 --> 2930.2200000000003
that is the reality that is how it works

2925.66 --> 2932.3799999999997
I have been among cybers okay I used to

2930.22 --> 2935.2
be in the goth scene remember there's

2932.38 --> 2937.3
literal cyber freaks there that were

2935.2 --> 2940.54
wearing masks

2937.3 --> 2943.42
a decade ago and more

2940.54 --> 2945.04
okay those people were like yeah I want

2943.42 --> 2948.16
to plug it I want to plug in

2945.04 --> 2952.0
those people were all [ __ ] depressed

I've never met one that isn't

2954.42 --> 2961.5
anti-social or depressed or or both

2958.72 --> 2961.5
so

2963.18 --> 2969.16
that kind of tells me something about

2965.619 --> 2969.1600000000003
you aries106

2973.42 --> 2979.599
right live a good life be a good person

2976.42 --> 2981.76
take responsibility like a man

2979.599 --> 2985.56
and you won't need

2981.76 --> 2989.1400000000003
a virtual world to escape in because

2985.56 --> 2991.119
life might actually be halfway enjoyable

2989.14 --> 2994.2999999999997
and you might actually feel good about

2991.119 --> 2997.48
who you really are then isn't that a

better approach

3000.79 --> 3005.8
[Music]

3008.16 --> 3014.2999999999997
what initially attracted me to the

3010.74 --> 3014.2999999999997
godson when I was younger

3015.06 --> 3019.98
Gothic Rock

3016.859 --> 3023.64
the art of it

3019.98 --> 3026.04
like the the beauty Renaissance

3023.64 --> 3028.44
to me goth was a beauty Renaissance

3026.04 --> 3032.819
started with Gothic Rock

3028.44 --> 3034.859
then got into metal then like black

3032.819 --> 3037.079
metal so it was pretty freaking dark and

3034.859 --> 3039.18
yeah I Le I liked the beauty of the

3037.079 --> 3040.44
darkness too in a way

3039.18 --> 3043.5789999999997
it was

3040.44 --> 3043.579
impressed by it

3044.16 --> 3051.359
I did not [ __ ] to it though I literally

3048.0 --> 3055.04
went to like dimu Borgir concerts live

3051.359 --> 3059.52
where I would be standing there like

3055.04 --> 3061.619
basically like I was in a war like I am

3059.52 --> 3063.599
fighting the devil right now while

3061.619 --> 3066.98
people were around me like oh I'm

3063.599 --> 3069.599
praying for you I'm practicing to curse

3066.98 --> 3071.22
these you [ __ ] [ __ ] I never got

3069.599 --> 3073.2000000000003
pissed off at any of them because it's

3071.22 --> 3077.2799999999997
pointless but I was literally there to

3073.2 --> 3079.68
just like I oppose Satan I'm right here

3077.28 --> 3082.44
what are you gonna do about it

3079.68 --> 3086.3999999999996
yeah not I'm not a bible thumper but I

3082.44 --> 3090.48
freaking oppose evil and surrender to it

3086.4 --> 3092.099
and I will be seduced to the maximum

3090.48 --> 3094.559
level

3092.099 --> 3098.7000000000003

3115.88 --> 3122.2400000000002
those people are insane

3119.04 --> 3122.24
and disgusting

3122.88 --> 3127.319
but I was kind of impressed at the time

3125.04 --> 3129.859
now I would never listen to that crap

3127.319 --> 3129.859
ever again

3129.9 --> 3133.6800000000003
except maybe to remind me how [ __ ] up

3132.3 --> 3136.8
it really is

3133.68 --> 3141.3799999999997
but I went into it to fight it

3136.8 --> 3141.38
not to be a slave to that retardation

3147.18 --> 3151.14
so he didn't like demo Burger but you

3149.04 --> 3154.8
went to the no I did like it I'd like to

3151.14 --> 3156.2
fight I liked to be drenched in evil and

3154.8 --> 3161.78
not

3156.2 --> 3161.7799999999997
enslaved by it it's crazy but yeah

3162.96 --> 3167.88
but anyway that eventually transitioned

3165.42 --> 3172.559
into just uh

3167.88 --> 3175.6400000000003
more Electro wave type music

3172.559 --> 3175.6400000000003
which is very different

3175.92 --> 3180.7200000000003
and that's where I hung around a lot the

3178.319 --> 3183.0
longest and like my favorite band that I

3180.72 --> 3186.54
got out of that is like mind in the Box

3183.0 --> 3189.44
very much my style

3186.54 --> 3189.44
anyways

3190.619 --> 3193.099
foreign

3201.66 --> 3206.359
is there's a lot of miserable people

3206.64 --> 3209.839
in the Cyber scene

3211.02 --> 3217.98
like genuinely miserable people that

3215.099 --> 3220.26
would just ooze misery from their face

3217.98 --> 3222.48
in their life it's like

3220.26 --> 3224.8190000000004
I've seen people like that where I was

3222.48 --> 3226.8
literally surprised like how how are

3224.819 --> 3229.16
they actually preventing from killing

3226.8 --> 3229.1600000000003
themselves

3229.8 --> 3235.52
because

3231.18 --> 3235.52
if I was that I'd freaking ended

3236.42 --> 3242.2200000000003
and probably a lot of them actually did

3239.22 --> 3242.22
eventually

3247.13 --> 3250.139
[Music]

3250.92 --> 3254.339
right but yeah I did not make a lot of

3253.26 --> 3257.2200000000003
friends

3254.339 --> 3258.89
in the Golf Scene but it just got to see

3257.22 --> 3263.0299999999997
a lot of sights

3258.89 --> 3263.0299999999997
[Music]

3286.559 --> 3291.059
toward an implant to interface with

3288.78 --> 3294.5400000000004
machines well why do you need an implant

3291.059 --> 3298.2000000000003
why not have a freaking headset thing

3294.54 --> 3300.96
like a little circlet you put it on or

3298.2 --> 3303.96
Google Glasses it should do it why the

3300.96 --> 3307.819
[ __ ] would you want to risk

3303.96 --> 3312.079
like a medical infraction on yourself

3307.819 --> 3312.079
you're crazy for that

3313.14 --> 3320.0989999999997
you don't need to do that to have your

3316.74 --> 3322.4399999999996
beloved interface

3320.099 --> 3324.78
ability for your machines

3322.44 --> 3328.079
yeah you don't need

3324.78 --> 3332.599
to have surgery to get to that point

3328.079 --> 3332.599
you're an idiot if you insist on that

3333.599 --> 3340.869
I mean it

3336.21 --> 3340.869
[Music]

3344.599 --> 3350.099
did I know anyone but myself that

3347.64 --> 3352.64
escaped The Goth scene intact

3350.099 --> 3352.6400000000003
no

3354.119 --> 3356.119
no

3356.76 --> 3359.8190000000004
not a single one

3358.43 --> 3362.7599999999998
[Music]

3359.819 --> 3365.7
I mean the best person that I still

3362.76 --> 3369.619
was friends with long after

3365.7 --> 3372.66
was the transsexual person

3369.619 --> 3375.7400000000002
who was a really good person overall but

3372.66 --> 3375.74
eventually like

3377.22 --> 3384.359
I haven't spoken to

3379.619 --> 3388.88
hidden her in years but no I do not know

3384.359 --> 3388.88
anybody from the god scene that has not

3389.599 --> 3394.8590000000004
been kind of screwed over by it except

3392.64 --> 3397.92
though in the electro scene in the

3394.859 --> 3400.22
electro scene there's plenty of decent

3397.92 --> 3400.2200000000003
people

3403.7 --> 3408.4199999999996
but yeah it's like just a group of

3406.74 --> 3411.5989999999997
people that kind of just happened to

3408.42 --> 3415.16
like music from the 80s and the 90s and

3411.599 --> 3415.1600000000003
a bit of good wave and [ __ ]

3415.74 --> 3419.9399999999996
but

3417.96 --> 3423.0
those are usually already kind of

3419.94 --> 3426.059
Oddball people anyway

3423.0 --> 3429.92
foreign but when it comes to like the

3426.059 --> 3433.5
real party scene with all the Cyber [ __ ]

3429.92 --> 3437.64
and and especially like black metal

3433.5 --> 3440.04
stuff and death metal dude

3437.64 --> 3442.2
I mean I'm not saying that people can't

3440.04 --> 3445.8
come out of it well and just have a good

3442.2 --> 3448.339
time but it does [ __ ] to you just by the

3445.8 --> 3453.02
exposure there is

3448.339 --> 3453.02
programming [ __ ] in that music

3463.7 --> 3466.8999999999996
[Music]

3467.88 --> 3473.819
Supreme knowing just leave a Como virus

3470.88 --> 3476.42
alone he's never going to convert

3473.819 --> 3476.42
ever

3476.88 --> 3484.98
you would have to like freaking

3480.54 --> 3487.74
no this is not just not gonna do it

3484.98 --> 3490.619
I tried yeah

3487.74 --> 3492.4799999999996
he's not gonna do it no point there's no

3490.619 --> 3497.54
point in doing it all you're doing is

3492.48 --> 3497.54
wasting your own energy this man is like

3497.7 --> 3503.7599999999998
he has his own built-in

3500.4 --> 3506.52
padded room okay inside of his own mind

3503.76 --> 3509.6600000000003
there's nothing you can do to change his

3506.52 --> 3509.66
mind about it ever

3510.23 --> 3516.02
[Music]

3516.24 --> 3518.839
foreign

3522.36 --> 3529.4
[Music]

3529.799 --> 3534.839
it's his problem

3532.26 --> 3536.88
he can't he can't do it in his mind so

3534.839 --> 3539.88
it's his freaking problem

3536.88 --> 3542.12
let it be his problem and not yours

3539.88 --> 3544.799
you shouldn't care about it anyway

3542.12 --> 3548.5989999999997
[Music]

3544.799 --> 3548.599
he could be on the payroll no

3554.16 --> 3559.0989999999997
I don't think so you would behave

3556.619 --> 3559.099
differently

3560.27 --> 3563.48
[Music]

3574.799 --> 3577.099
foreign

3588.68 --> 3606.5
[Music]

3602.7 --> 3606.5
you want to convert

3607.02 --> 3610.339
what do you mean with that

3613.319 --> 3618.66
if you want to convert you're already

3615.299 --> 3621.42
converted this is ridiculous

3618.66 --> 3624.0
yeah the whole point about it is that

3621.42 --> 3626.2200000000003
you want to know about it

3624.0 --> 3627.54
that's mean that means you're already

3626.22 --> 3629.5789999999997
converted

3627.54 --> 3632.9
unless you're just making it up because

3629.579 --> 3632.9
you're a [ __ ] or troll

3637.2 --> 3641.1189999999997
no you don't Supreme knowing

thank you

3646.72 --> 3652.9399999999996
[Music]

3651.54 --> 3656.96
okay

3652.94 --> 3660.0
it seems like you're very

3656.96 --> 3661.44
compartmentalized person

3660.0 --> 3663.0
yeah

3661.44 --> 3665.339
I mean

3663.0 --> 3667.5
what kind of a question is that did did

3665.339 --> 3671.52
you did you check out the title of the

3667.5 --> 3673.92
show hey dummy newcomer dummy

3671.52 --> 3674.88
that the title of the show did you check

3673.92 --> 3677.48
it

3674.88 --> 3677.48
huh

3686.48 --> 3696.459
[Music]

3709.2 --> 3713.8999999999996
yeah because you straw man does dick

3718.22 --> 3724.14
stupid flat

3721.26 --> 3726.96
disc in space there's no flat earther

3724.14 --> 3728.46
that's actually a legitimate Flat Earth

3726.96 --> 3731.4
they're trying to figure out how this

3728.46 --> 3733.38
world works that believes that crap from

3731.4 --> 3735.78
the Flat Earth Society that was

3733.38 --> 3738.7200000000003
specifically designed and placed and

3735.78 --> 3741.7200000000003
popularized to a certain degree just to

3738.72 --> 3743.7599999999998
mock flat earthers and discourage them

3741.72 --> 3747.0
from engaging because it looks so

3743.76 --> 3751.0200000000004
[ __ ] that way yeah

3747.0 --> 3753.74
nobody actually takes that serious

3751.02 --> 3753.74
nobody

3755.16 --> 3758.72
there is no space

3759.9 --> 3765.7400000000002
yeah and there's no proof that the Earth

3762.54 --> 3765.74
is literally a disc

3768.96 --> 3775.5
it's flat but

3772.68 --> 3778.2599999999998
yeah there are all kinds of complication

3775.5 --> 3780.18
factors

3778.26 --> 3782.46
it's not just going to be a

3780.18 --> 3786.0589999999997
straightforward thing that you can make

3782.46 --> 3787.799
in a little model in your hand yeah

3786.059 --> 3790.2200000000003
it's very likely that that's not

3787.799 --> 3790.22
possible

3791.579 --> 3796.7000000000003
yeah it's not just a little snow globe

3794.22 --> 3796.7
thing

3812.339 --> 3820.0789999999997
okay okay mate well maybe you are just a

3817.079 --> 3822.9
person that just came in let me check

3820.079 --> 3825.3590000000004
your channel to see if you're a troll

3822.9 --> 3828.839
huh

3825.359 --> 3831.54
okay don't have videos your account has

3828.839 --> 3835.46
been around for a while

3831.54 --> 3835.46
probably don't look that young anymore

3835.859 --> 3840.42
right okay

3838.14 --> 3841.44
oh if you re if you just bumped into

3840.42 --> 3843.48
this

3841.44 --> 3845.16
and you're really curious about Flat

3843.48 --> 3847.319
Earth and why

3845.16 --> 3852.359
then check out the Flat Earth debates

3847.319 --> 3855.96
over at Nathan Oakley 9080 Channel

3852.359 --> 3858.9
and you'll learn a lot

3855.96 --> 3861.54
this main focus of that show

3858.9 --> 3863.61
my show is a little bit more widespread

3861.54 --> 3867.72
than whatever comes to mind

3863.61 --> 3869.88
[Music]

3867.72 --> 3872.339
that's right it is very hard to include

3869.88 --> 3873.07
the phenomenon of looping in the snow

3872.339 --> 3876.7599999999998
globe

3873.07 --> 3876.76
[Music]

3881.4 --> 3887.46
you could simulate it in

3884.099 --> 3889.86
a computer simulation though

3887.46 --> 3902.579
but not in a physical object

3889.86 --> 3907.04
[Music]

3902.579 --> 3907.04
Auto crap project what

3907.76 --> 3912.7990000000004
all five graph what does that mean

3922.68 --> 3925.22
okay

3945.72 --> 3951.0589999999997
[Music]

3948.599 --> 3953.819

on and I'm still freezing

3958.14 --> 3962.4
foreign

3959.64 --> 3965.18
maybe it's also because I just did not

3962.4 --> 3965.1800000000003
have a great rest

3971.599 --> 3975.98
although I'm feeling a lot better by now

3984.48 --> 3989.46
there it says there's a lot of rain

3986.22 --> 3993.859
around but I'm not seeing it so far

3989.46 --> 3993.859
so there's a really big cloud over there

3995.819 --> 3999.319

4514.04 --> 4519.56
of the Milky Way galaxy or whatever

4517.34 --> 4521.96
right which is supposed to be like a

4519.56 --> 4524.2390000000005
super black hole at the center Etc yeah

4521.96 --> 4526.699
that has an axis but I'm talking about

4524.239 --> 4529.718999999999
the Galaxy axis specifically in relation

4526.699 --> 4529.719
to stationary Earth

4530.3 --> 4538.6990000000005
right and the that Galaxy axis would be

4534.98 --> 4542.178999999999
the line the virtual line

4538.699 --> 4544.839999999999
between Polaris and the dead center of

4542.179 --> 4544.84
the Southern Cross

4553.1 --> 4561.14
[Music]

4558.5 --> 4566.179
good

4561.14 --> 4567.4400000000005
oh that's right yeah LBA pull I had lva

4566.179 --> 4571.12
poll on

4567.44 --> 4571.12
is it last week or the week before

4571.94 --> 4574.78
let me look that up

4591.76 --> 4602.360000000001
man I've had a lot of titles recently

4597.04 --> 4605.6
oh yeah LPA Paul about corporatocracy

4602.36 --> 4608.599999999999
yeah it's a show 1382.

4605.6 --> 4613.04
it does not have more viewers

4608.6 --> 4617.2390000000005
I mean 1383 at 312.

4613.04 --> 4619.5199999999995
one with lva poll had 262.

4617.239 --> 4623.36
oh what does get a lot of views though

4619.52 --> 4627.5
is when I put rage win in the title like

4623.36 --> 4630.219
1384 which is 406 views

4627.5 --> 4630.219
so

4636.98 --> 4643.48
me getting pissed off does attract a lot

4639.92 --> 4643.4800000000005
of squirty people I guess

4643.94 --> 4648.86
on the other hand yeah

4646.4 --> 4651.5
it is gratifying I actually like

4648.86 --> 4653.98
watching Miko Ray twin I like watching

4651.5 --> 4653.98
that back

4654.08 --> 4659.96
because I do it right I'm not a loose

4657.02 --> 4661.360000000001
cannon that's just blowing himself up

4659.96 --> 4664.4
laughs

4661.36 --> 4668.19
because that would be embarrassing if it

4664.4 --> 4671.32
it would be if it was just that

4668.19 --> 4671.32
[Music]

4671.84 --> 4675.860000000001
great twin cells yeah I guess it does

4674.0 --> 4679.06
but that doesn't mean I'm going to be a

4675.86 --> 4679.0599999999995
rage win salesman

4685.4 --> 4692.0599999999995
like to watch my own Rage that's amazing

4688.88 --> 4695.900000000001
well why wouldn't I

4692.06 --> 4698.2390000000005
like my when I do that it's Justified

4695.9 --> 4701.139999999999
it's there for a reason

4698.239 --> 4701.139999999999
I'm honest

4704.42 --> 4710.84
and I don't have an objective to destroy

4707.6 --> 4714.02
everything merely to get my internals

4710.84 --> 4717.64
under control again and for that I need

4714.02 --> 4717.64
to get a little expressive

4720.199 --> 4724.0
raytrain must take a toll on you

4722.0 --> 4727.1
absolutely

4724.0 --> 4729.679
absolutely it does it's

4727.1 --> 4732.9800000000005
going rate when

4729.679 --> 4735.8
and yeah well when it's as heavy as like

4732.98 --> 4738.379999999999
episode 82 that's like

4735.8 --> 4741.7390000000005
dangerous because that's like almost

4738.38 --> 4743.96
like a psychotic break effect it's so

4741.739 --> 4746.659
shocking to suddenly

4743.96 --> 4749.659
having some held back something so long

4746.659 --> 4751.639999999999
which I had at that point I had like

4749.659 --> 4754.04
completely censored myself

4751.64 --> 4756.1990000000005
from that entire subject

4754.04 --> 4758.06
since the start and that was the moment

4756.199 --> 4760.699
where it's basically like okay this is

4758.06 --> 4763.820000000001
actually also inside of me and then it

4760.699 --> 4766.4
just got pulled out like a waterfall and

4763.82 --> 4768.86
it went completely berserk

4766.4 --> 4770.659
without destroying anything by the way

4768.86 --> 4773.179
physical

4770.659 --> 4775.4
and yeah that was super shocking

4773.179 --> 4780.08
afterward I was like

4775.4 --> 4782.12
I felt raw like my throat hurt my lungs

4780.08 --> 4785.0
were like because I was just pissed off

4782.12 --> 4787.58
and that hurts it's like if you get in a

4785.0 --> 4790.82
spousal fight with a lot of yelling

4787.58 --> 4792.26
that's super draining well being rage

4790.82 --> 4796.0599999999995
win

4792.26 --> 4796.06
is a little like that too

4803.719 --> 4806.92
whatever is

4807.02 --> 4809.320000000001
foreign

4812.14 --> 4817.46
I kind of think it's a bit of a silly

4814.64 --> 4821.5
name but I like that

4817.46 --> 4821.5
I like that it sounds a little silly

4822.08 --> 4827.36
because it's not I don't think it's cool

4825.199 --> 4829.94
to do that

4827.36 --> 4832.4
I do rage when basically because I have

4829.94 --> 4834.259999999999
no other choice I need to do that to

4832.4 --> 4836.12
process through things and get it

4834.26 --> 4839.4800000000005
resolved and move on

4836.12 --> 4842.719
it's not like oh yeah I'm rich way to

4839.48 --> 4845.799999999999
get oh yeah it was so cool badass Rachel

4842.719 --> 4845.8
no no no

4847.76 --> 4853.46
I don't see it like that at all

4851.36 --> 4855.639999999999
and it is kind of unpleasant when it

4853.46 --> 4855.64
happens

4858.5 --> 4863.6
like in that moment but I am just better

4862.58 --> 4866.78
at

4863.6 --> 4870.620000000001
dealing with it

4866.78 --> 4872.659
and to not accidentally shoot myself in

4870.62 --> 4874.159
the foot or something when I'm in when

4872.659 --> 4876.379999999999
I'm like that

4874.159 --> 4878.179
because there's a lot of tendencies that

4876.38 --> 4882.02
basically just go

4878.179 --> 4884.3
and attack or like like

4882.02 --> 4886.9400000000005
dump people

4884.3 --> 4888.679
like I'm done with it I'm like you can

4886.94 --> 4890.9
all go [ __ ] yourself I never want to see

4888.679 --> 4893.06
you again that sort of [ __ ] yeah because

4890.9 --> 4894.5
that happens when you're really pissed

4893.06 --> 4896.6
off

4894.5 --> 4898.82
it happens to me at least and I always

4896.6 --> 4901.159000000001
have to like keep in mind like yeah yeah

4898.82 --> 4904.159
yeah it's a little exaggerated right now

4901.159 --> 4906.159
so you can't actually do that you have

4904.159 --> 4909.5599999999995
to be reasonable

4906.159 --> 4912.5
even if you're enraged

4909.56 --> 4914.2390000000005
and that's a bit of a juggle to get a

4912.5 --> 4916.82
good balance in that

4914.239 --> 4919.48
but I think that I've progressed in the

4916.82 --> 4919.48
last few years

4924.739 --> 4929.839999999999
no and I'm not gonna make a heavy metal

4927.02 --> 4932.080000000001
that it's Rachel videos that would be

4929.84 --> 4932.08
weird

4938.38 --> 4946.6990000000005
right that would be like dramaticizing

4942.08 --> 4950.239
it taking the actual power away from it

4946.699 --> 4953.659
because the real power is not the rage

4950.239 --> 4957.699
it's the intention that lies underneath

4953.659 --> 4957.699
that the reason why

4959.5 --> 4964.54
meaningful chaos no it's not chaos

4964.82 --> 4968.179
chaos

4966.08 --> 4970.58
doesn't exist

4968.179 --> 4975.26
chaos is a

4970.58 --> 4978.44
is a subjective concept that is based in

4975.26 --> 4981.1990000000005
tellectual fatigue

4978.44 --> 4984.62
where you simply cannot understand the

4981.199 --> 4986.78
patterns that are and must be there

4984.62 --> 4990.38
because there is no such thing as no

4986.78 --> 4993.5599999999995
pattern everything is a pattern like the

4990.38 --> 4995.54
pattern all of it everything everything

4993.56 --> 4998.179
no exception

4995.54 --> 5000.36
so chaos technically doesn't exist in my

4998.179 --> 5000.36
book

5000.4 --> 5006.58
but there are times where I fatigue and

5003.4 --> 5008.259999999999
then it's chaos to me but that's only to

5006.58 --> 5012.5199999999995
me because I know there's other people

5008.26 --> 5015.6
out there to which it will not be chaos

5012.52 --> 5015.6
in that moment

5016.179 --> 5019.9800000000005
maybe the music or Apple

5021.28 --> 5027.42
whatever man I'm not gonna make metal

5023.44 --> 5027.419999999999
videos and that's final

5033.34 --> 5038.5
I mean if somebody else wants to make a

5036.1 --> 5042.76
little video like that of me I'm like

5038.5 --> 5046.0
okay fine as long as it's yeah

5042.76 --> 5048.34
as long as the context isn't lost and I

5046.0 --> 5051.159
it doesn't make me look just like a

5048.34 --> 5053.360000000001
madman going insane because that's not

5051.159 --> 5054.5199999999995
what I want out of that at all

5053.36 --> 5056.799999999999
[Music]

5054.52 --> 5059.4400000000005
but hey if somebody's inspired to make a

5056.8 --> 5062.56
sort of a music video with some of these

5059.44 --> 5064.48
moments okay as long as it's done with

5062.56 --> 5068.5
the best intentions and in Good Taste

5064.48 --> 5070.959999999999
I'm fully okay with that I mean trolls

5068.5 --> 5074.56
are already making [ __ ] about me I'm

5070.96 --> 5077.14
crazy stupid videos of psychopaths and

5074.56 --> 5079.4800000000005
then pasting my face over that movie and

5077.14 --> 5081.88
[ __ ] I mean so yeah there's already [ __ ]

5079.48 --> 5083.82
out there anyway somebody wants to make

5081.88 --> 5087.82
a metal

5083.82 --> 5090.219
music video with like some of my rage

5087.82 --> 5093.94
win moments then okay sure if you can

5090.219 --> 5096.88
actually kind of make it sound cool

5093.94 --> 5099.04
and honor that the underlying message

5096.88 --> 5101.86
then yeah that's fine with me but I'm

5099.04 --> 5104.38
not gonna do that

5101.86 --> 5105.58
I'm not really good at video editing

5104.38 --> 5108.28
anyway

5105.58 --> 5110.5
barely any experience

5108.28 --> 5113.5
like

5110.5 --> 5116.5
last time I tried that was flat cat

5113.5 --> 5116.5
wow

5117.76 --> 5123.04
I mean it's not my thing if you know

5120.94 --> 5125.5
what I mean

5123.04 --> 5129.06
just not

5125.5 --> 5129.06
not ever wanted to do that anyway

5136.78 --> 5140.88
but hey if you want to do it fine

5142.659 --> 5148.5
as long as it's in good taste with good

5145.96 --> 5148.5
intentions

5155.38 --> 5158.38
foreign

5176.46 --> 5182.08
the power of my message well you know

5179.5 --> 5184.96
what Aries I mean if you're really gonna

5182.08 --> 5187.679
go that direction then yeah

5184.96 --> 5192.04
I could technically make

5187.679 --> 5194.62
very angry lyrics for people

5192.04 --> 5197.88
that have like a metal band

5194.62 --> 5197.88
I could do that

5199.0 --> 5203.94
I can write words just as intense

5206.08 --> 5213.699
now do I have an ambition to that no

5211.12 --> 5217.84
but I know I can

5213.699 --> 5220.0
if somebody would call upon me to try

5217.84 --> 5223.360000000001
out something like that I'd probably

5220.0 --> 5227.199
just do it just to see what it's like

5223.36 --> 5229.54
and I know that what I do will

5227.199 --> 5232.419999999999
yeah the results will be beyond my

5229.54 --> 5234.28
expectations because when I actually do

5232.42 --> 5236.62
things they usually are beyond my

5234.28 --> 5239.38
expectations

5236.62 --> 5241.54
I'm actually a lot better in things than

5239.38 --> 5242.38
I size myself up in

5241.54 --> 5244.659
as

5242.38 --> 5246.82
so

5244.659 --> 5250.54
don't have a flat Earth metal band well

5246.82 --> 5253.0599999999995
maybe because the vibe would be off with

5250.54 --> 5256.239
that Aries 106.

5253.06 --> 5258.820000000001
yeah maybe we don't want to associate

5256.239 --> 5261.78
flat earth with like metal

5258.82 --> 5261.78
too much

5261.94 --> 5269.339999999999
ever thought about that

5265.12 --> 5269.34
have I ever written songs no

5270.58 --> 5273.96
not that I remember anyway

5281.26 --> 5284.26
what

5288.4 --> 5291.239
subtle

5351.52 --> 5356.38

5353.219 --> 5359.699
would YouTube censor a word like that

5356.38 --> 5359.6990000000005
that's kind of ridiculous

5388.6 --> 5392.38
I guess it's raining over there but yeah

5390.699 --> 5394.48
I see a rainbow

5392.38 --> 5398.34
see that

5394.48 --> 5398.339999999999
like right over that building

5399.82 --> 5404.5599999999995
it's also a really dark cloud there by

5402.159 --> 5406.78
the way you see it

5404.56 --> 5411.4800000000005
yeah I think yeah

5406.78 --> 5411.48
it's a bit vague but it's right there

5412.3 --> 5415.08
you see it

5418.659 --> 5423.28
it's

5419.86 --> 5425.5
right atop that building there

5423.28 --> 5427.48
but doesn't the webcam doesn't seem to

5425.5 --> 5431.04
be really picking up the colors all that

5427.48 --> 5431.04
much not as much as my eyes

5431.5 --> 5434.52
to yeah

5434.8 --> 5440.28
just look at how freaking thick that

5437.32 --> 5440.28
cloud there is it's

5440.32 --> 5443.94
well very thick

5453.04 --> 5458.949
let's do parts of blue

5455.91 --> 5458.949

hmm

5535.239 --> 5539.339999999999
oh wow seeking star wired that's cool

5543.94 --> 5549.78
so you found back a song you wrote or

5546.52 --> 5549.780000000001
actually a recording

5558.4 --> 5565.659
and then

5559.69 --> 5565.659
[Music]

5573.3 --> 5577.719
not too bad

5576.159 --> 5580.92
that would have been cool

5577.719 --> 5580.92
to have that

5593.4 --> 5599.799999999999
so are you gonna record it then are you

5597.4 --> 5604.199
gonna record it now I mean

5599.8 --> 5604.1990000000005

that is weird

5789.88 --> 5794.86
I'm gonna google it to see if it's

5791.98 --> 5797.459999999999
actually some fragrance that's really

5825.639 --> 5830.400000000001
they don't have a fragrance called Thor

poor Casey I have no idea man

5870.639 --> 5875.62
I hate it

I I hate deodorant

5875.62 --> 5881.62
I hate all that [ __ ] it's super bad for

5878.98 --> 5883.718999999999
me so I like every time it's like oh the

5881.62 --> 5885.699
newest fragrance is like oh my God not

5883.719 --> 5888.76
more chemical warfare because that's

5885.699 --> 5891.879999999999
what it's to me chemical warfare unless

5888.76 --> 5894.280000000001
it's a Well an organic extract

5891.88 --> 5897.54
where it's just like flowers dissolved

5894.28 --> 5897.54
in oil or something right

5898.78 --> 5904.42
that all except but all that perfume

5901.84 --> 5907.0
crap I hate it I think it's

5904.42 --> 5909.42
I think it's actually bad for the

5907.0 --> 5909.42
environment

5952.12 --> 5955.08
Kansas City

5957.659 --> 5964.08

hey what's that link

foreign

6015.239 --> 6018.138999999999
okay

6023.94 --> 6030.9
wow so it's like a whole the word

6026.639 --> 6035.04
flankers is apparently a sales strategy

6030.9 --> 6036.96
thing okay this is I thought it was just

6035.04 --> 6040.199
a fragrance called flankers or something

6036.96 --> 6043.38
whatever I don't know man I don't care I

6040.199 --> 6044.94
hate perfume I don't like it I think it

6043.38 --> 6047.36
stinks I think it's bad for the

6044.94 --> 6047.36
environment

6047.48 --> 6054.239
and I think that using it actually on

6051.239 --> 6056.099999999999
the long run makes you stink more

6054.239 --> 6058.08
because you're subjecting yourself to

6056.1 --> 6059.820000000001
chemical [ __ ]

6058.08 --> 6064.139
a lot of the time unless you get

6059.82 --> 6068.36
Perfectly Natural perfumes you know

6064.139 --> 6068.36
but that's not the mainstream crap

6078.239 --> 6083.94
yeah don't don't use deodorant it just

6081.12 --> 6086.159
it like deposits aluminum

6083.94 --> 6090.0199999999995
or aluminum

6086.159 --> 6090.0199999999995
on you it's very unhealthy

6096.0 --> 6103.52
if you want to stink less eat healthier

6100.02 --> 6106.4400000000005
and yeah don't over wash yourself

6103.52 --> 6109.02
because over washing yourself if you

6106.44 --> 6110.638999999999
take a shower like twice a day your body

6109.02 --> 6114.1990000000005
is going to overcompensate you're

6110.639 --> 6114.1990000000005
actually gonna stink more then

6120.3 --> 6123.3
foreign

6124.28 --> 6129.9
's cool well look if you're like a a

6127.86 --> 6133.139
hard laborer type

6129.9 --> 6135.78
then I guess that yeah

6133.139 --> 6137.9400000000005
it would be more preferable you know but

6135.78 --> 6139.139
a lot of it really has to do with what

6137.94 --> 6141.9
they're eating

6139.139 --> 6144.119
I mean if you're sloppy with eating

6141.9 --> 6146.82
you get cheap crap

6144.119 --> 6149.5199999999995
in some yeah from some snack bar at the

6146.82 --> 6151.139
corner a lot of the times you're gonna

6149.52 --> 6153.4800000000005
stink

6151.139 --> 6155.28
that's their reason the most of the

6153.48 --> 6158.04
reason why people really stink it's

6155.28 --> 6160.92
because of what they eat

6158.04 --> 6162.719
and then they try to wash it off and

6160.92 --> 6165.719
that makes it even worse

6162.719 --> 6165.719
right

6166.199 --> 6170.48
I learned this very young

6170.699 --> 6177.239
that just don't take showers continually

6174.54 --> 6180.56
don't use deodorant like don't start

6177.239 --> 6180.5599999999995
using it at a young age

6180.84 --> 6187.82
I did actually use it for a while

6184.08 --> 6187.82
and then like around

6191.36 --> 6197.04
17 or 18 I stopped

6194.94 --> 6199.5
because I was noticing that it was

6197.04 --> 6202.08
literally like poisoning myself

6199.5 --> 6204.119
I was starting to feel

6202.08 --> 6206.219
that [ __ ] getting absorbed in my system

6204.119 --> 6208.46
and like doing something that that's not

6206.219 --> 6208.46
right

6208.56 --> 6214.9800000000005
and then I learned to wash my feet every

6211.8 --> 6216.119000000001
day instead of going under the shower

6214.98 --> 6217.919999999999
every day

6216.119 --> 6220.679
and I've done that

6217.92 --> 6224.4
for more than half my life now

6220.679 --> 6224.4
it's working fantastic

6226.139 --> 6232.32
don't stink

6228.36 --> 6233.759999999999
don't use perfume deodorants ever and I

6232.32 --> 6237.719
don't stink

6233.76 --> 6240.2390000000005
eat all organic and now I don't stink

6237.719 --> 6243.32
how about that huh

6240.239 --> 6243.32
you can do that too

6249.13 --> 6257.4890000000005
[Music]

6263.82 --> 6271.0199999999995
that's what you eat is also what to wear

6265.739 --> 6273.119
yeah yeah okay fair enough that too

6271.02 --> 6275.400000000001
I mean if you're gonna like if you're

6273.119 --> 6277.679
gonna be a hard laborer type

6275.4 --> 6279.78
yeah you better well make sure that

6277.679 --> 6282.84
after one of those hard days work you

6279.78 --> 6284.94
put your clothes in the wash I'm not

6282.84 --> 6287.28
saying not to wash your clothes every

6284.94 --> 6289.678999999999
day if you're like a hard labor type of

6287.28 --> 6292.5
course you should or have your wife do

6289.679 --> 6293.9400000000005
it or something right

6292.5 --> 6297.06
I mean

6293.94 --> 6299.219
otherwise it's gross but if you're not a

6297.06 --> 6302.1
hard labor type

6299.219 --> 6304.34
then you don't need to constantly do

6302.1 --> 6304.34
that

6305.219 --> 6308.58
right

6306.36 --> 6310.98
and it's weird by the way because it's

6308.58 --> 6313.5599999999995
not like I have a lack of sweating or

6310.98 --> 6316.86
anything I mean every freaking time I go

6313.56 --> 6319.56
out for groceries I'm sweating like

6316.86 --> 6322.08
insane there's like a liter of sweat

6319.56 --> 6323.76
coming out of me it's gross but it

6322.08 --> 6327.3
always happens doesn't matter if it's

6323.76 --> 6328.820000000001
hot or if it's cold it always happens

6327.3 --> 6331.9800000000005
well

6328.82 --> 6335.4
that sweat apparently is really

6331.98 --> 6338.299999999999
unpolluted because it just dries up and

6335.4 --> 6341.28
I keep wearing

6338.3 --> 6345.08
roughly the same clothes quite long

6341.28 --> 6345.08
without it getting disgusting

6348.719 --> 6352.86
it just doesn't

6350.76 --> 6355.92
because I think that my sweat is really

6352.86 --> 6357.659
like an emergency cooling system at that

6355.92 --> 6360.06
point and it's mostly just water it's

6357.659 --> 6362.759999999999
not like oh what a good opportunity to

6360.06 --> 6365.400000000001
dump all that toxic waste that we had

6362.76 --> 6367.9800000000005
gathered up because of our bad food

6365.4 --> 6370.32
habits right that could happen then I

6367.98 --> 6372.659
mean multifunctional sweating and

6370.32 --> 6374.88
multifunctional has multiple functions

6372.659 --> 6378.0
right

6374.88 --> 6380.639
including dumping [ __ ]

6378.0 --> 6382.5
that's waiting to be dumped because

6380.639 --> 6384.119
your body's not taking care of it in

6382.5 --> 6385.98
another way

6384.119 --> 6388.5599999999995
right then there's also like the

6385.98 --> 6390.718999999999
bacteria issue right

6388.56 --> 6393.3
you know what makes sweat really stink

6390.719 --> 6394.92
what that actually is it's the bacteria

6393.3 --> 6397.5
there

6394.92 --> 6400.56
it's it's like a specific bacterial

6397.5 --> 6401.76
flora and that is what makes it stink so

6400.56 --> 6402.900000000001
incredible

6401.76 --> 6405.900000000001
right

6402.9 --> 6408.839999999999
well guess what if you take really good

6405.9 --> 6411.179
care of your bacteria well for example

6408.84 --> 6414.78
by not freaking washing with with

6411.179 --> 6417.06
shampoo every day and [ __ ] yeah because

6414.78 --> 6421.699
of that

6417.06 --> 6426.6
my natural skin bacterial Flora

6421.699 --> 6428.4
eats stinky bacteria and so I do not

6426.6 --> 6429.719
stink

6428.4 --> 6431.339999999999
ever

6429.719 --> 6434.1
huh

6431.34 --> 6436.679
took a lot of dedication you could say

6434.1 --> 6439.38
but yeah it's never been oh I have to do

6436.679 --> 6441.42
all of this just not the stink now the

6439.38 --> 6443.58
not stinking has been like a really good

6441.42 --> 6445.56
bonus

6443.58 --> 6449.42
because I'm actually doing it just to be

6445.56 --> 6449.42
healthier sharper and live longer

6451.739 --> 6456.0
that's right Jeff gas head

6453.84 --> 6457.92
interior fart anyway I'm rounding out

6456.0 --> 6459.719
the show before it starts to stink too

6457.92 --> 6461.159
much

6459.719 --> 6463.199
uh

6461.159 --> 6465.739
been all over the place today but it's

6463.199 --> 6465.739
been fine

6467.94 --> 6472.619
glad that it did work out because like

6470.699 --> 6474.78
