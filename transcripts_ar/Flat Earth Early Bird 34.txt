2.159 --> 9.370000000000001
good morning welcome to a flat earth

6.069 --> 14.7
early-bird number 34 I'm your host

9.37 --> 19.15
Arwen uh yeah it's a beautiful day today

14.7 --> 23.74
really cold though got very clear no

19.15 --> 32.519
ring and it's even nice and sunny every

23.74 --> 32.519
now and then see ya see nice

32.98 --> 40.33
plenty of birds spotted as well it's

37.87 --> 42.76
funny just walking around a couple of

40.33 --> 46.12
bushes in like this very tiny little

42.76 --> 48.12
birds are just hiding in there it's

46.12 --> 53.32
funny like blackbirds

48.12 --> 56.29
they're hilarious because what they

53.32 --> 58.3
always do is they try to hide and yet

56.29 --> 62.65
you can't really spot them but they are

58.3 --> 64.66
always so noisy and like even when they

62.65 --> 68.05
try to hide they just make noise so it's

64.66 --> 71.83
like oh I can't see something oh I can

68.05 --> 73.33
hear something moving okay that's likely

71.83 --> 78.07
gonna be a black bird because they're

73.33 --> 79.42
very messy even when I try to hide but

78.07 --> 81.63999999999999
yeah this wasn't the black bird was a

79.42 --> 84.1
[ __ ] very small bird I just happened

81.64 --> 86.49
to look right at it through the bushes

84.1 --> 88.6
when it was walking around there

86.49 --> 92.71
otherwise I wouldn't never never have

88.6 --> 94.0
noticed yeah the birds like this weather

92.71 --> 97.24
and I like it too

94.0 --> 101.62
so guys have been having a very

97.24 --> 104.74
extensive chat before dystocia before

101.62 --> 108.10000000000001
the show started with Daniel field and

104.74 --> 116.53
Joseph Saunders interesting about the

108.1 --> 119.11
pineal gland and very extensive I guess

116.53 --> 122.979
I inspired some people with my wizard

119.11 --> 127.0
lecture yesterday hmm that's not that

122.979 --> 130.08
just be careful be very very careful and

127.0 --> 132.79
know who you are

130.08 --> 138.01000000000002
or

132.79 --> 141.28
at least an erection path have a purpose

138.01 --> 146.79899999999998
before you engage in this engaging it

141.28 --> 149.2
knowingly and willingly don't do it the

146.799 --> 150.989
way I did it basically not even knowing

149.2 --> 157.409
what I was doing

150.989 --> 157.409
don't be reckless don't be naive and

158.099 --> 164.819
yeah don't take drugs from strangers

161.5 --> 167.62
well that's kind of obvious you know I

164.819 --> 172.29899999999998
guess to me it wasn't that obvious

167.62 --> 177.22
I was really reckless and as I call it

172.299 --> 187.0
morbidly curious when I was younger up

177.22 --> 190.389
until the end of my teens see so David

187.0 --> 195.819
Rees also in Chatwin Thorson Ragnar

190.389 --> 199.09
Stephan Halverson Nicholas so thanks

195.819 --> 202.86999999999998
guys for coming yeah I almost have an

199.09 --> 205.18
intro I got some really good video

202.87 --> 209.31900000000002
material together I got an excellent

205.18 --> 214.0
song again from Chris Barrie he even

209.319 --> 216.16
perfected it and yeah all that's left

214.0 --> 219.459
really is a title card so yeah who's

216.16 --> 220.799
gonna help me with that you know I could

219.459 --> 224.29
just do something

220.799 --> 226.359
ultra basic basically a picture who

224.29 --> 231.0
knows I could draw a still picture and

226.359 --> 235.18
then added that in it would look really

231.0 --> 238.209
sketchy and cheap I presume maybe I

235.18 --> 240.73000000000002
don't know but it's probably not a

238.209 --> 244.15
proper title card I would have I would

240.73 --> 246.73
prefer one that's animated and I need

244.15 --> 251.199
some help so if you know anyone out

246.73 --> 254.069
there if you have any doesn't even have

251.199 --> 257.79900000000004
to be elaborate but experience making

254.069 --> 262.3
title cards and I made it once then

257.799 --> 265.47999999999996
please contact me and let's see if we

262.3 --> 267.97
can make this early bird show into

265.48 --> 272.5
they're real shots is it real showing

267.97 --> 275.41
more than just me talking and have a

272.5 --> 277.75
good title card cuz yeah I'm really

275.41 --> 281.53000000000003
enthusiastic about this title card I

277.75 --> 285.1
like it I like what I got so far like

281.53 --> 287.52
the song I like the concept feels good

285.1 --> 290.71000000000004
feels right for the show

287.52 --> 293.5
can't wait to present it oh I have to

290.71 --> 297.19
learn first how to do that i i'm not

293.5 --> 300.34
using OBS so i'll have to somehow play

297.19 --> 306.55
it and present it and hope that the

300.34 --> 309.58
sound just comes through properly and

306.55 --> 312.58
maybe yeah this is just gonna force me

309.58 --> 314.68
one step closer to actually using OBS i

312.58 --> 318.72999999999996
hope nathan is gonna give me some tips

314.68 --> 320.62
on this when i'm ready to receive them

318.73 --> 324.25
first i want the material ready first

320.62 --> 328.02
they want the intro ready and then then

324.25 --> 328.02
get there so

334.83 --> 340.039
lots of stuff happening in the world I

340.55 --> 351.629
think I made a new enemy although this

344.61 --> 358.289
person is not shy making enemies you

351.629 --> 362.159
know who he is it's vegan [ __ ] maybe I'll

358.289 --> 367.02
start calling him vegan gay but yeah

362.159 --> 369.81
that's I don't know I think on average

367.02 --> 372.479
the gay people that I've come across in

369.81 --> 380.159
my life are a lot more tolerable than

372.479 --> 383.87899999999996
this guy but I triggered him I went to

380.159 --> 386.069
his hangout and I started to do what I

383.879 --> 389.46000000000004
like to do I basically gave him a Lhari

386.069 --> 392.94
treatment a troll treatment and just

389.46 --> 396.419
told him exactly what he was doing and

392.94 --> 398.639
he got so triggered he literally started

396.419 --> 401.789
yelling and calling me a [ __ ] in an

398.639 --> 402.659
effing [ __ ] like repeatedly like a

401.789 --> 411.539
twelve-year-old

402.659 --> 415.289
was kind of hilarious so yeah that

411.539 --> 417.479
happens I don't know it it was it wasn't

415.289 --> 420.84
gonna come anyway this guy is just I

417.479 --> 426.71
can't stand him he's so incredibly

420.84 --> 426.71
negative always and he doesn't care and

428.419 --> 437.4
he goes over lines that of lines of

432.99 --> 439.199
common decency and yeah yesterday on his

437.4 --> 443.4
show I don't know if anybody even

439.199 --> 446.58000000000004
noticed this but he was basically in

443.4 --> 447.539
between tongue and cheek trying to help

446.58 --> 450.96
a friend

447.539 --> 453.18
fence stolen goods life on air hey does

450.96 --> 455.34
anybody want this really Keith it's

453.18 --> 460.59000000000003
really good it fell off the back of a

455.34 --> 467.17999999999995
truck hahaha so funny yeah you you want

460.59 --> 469.96999999999997
to be associated with that guy not me

467.18 --> 472.61
and I didn't really like him anyway you

469.97 --> 476.06
know this is crazy

472.61 --> 481.31
tips of like denying the state in every

476.06 --> 483.71
opportunity which is very practical bad

481.31 --> 486.77
advice although technically yeah he may

483.71 --> 491.08
be right but yet you can't do that stuff

486.77 --> 491.08
without consequences and he may have

491.53 --> 495.85999999999996
rearranged his life to apply that and

494.81 --> 498.26
Wow

495.86 --> 502.13
credit to him you know it's tough to do

498.26 --> 506.51
that it's a big decision with a lot of

502.13 --> 509.3
consequences and it's brave I guess up

506.51 --> 511.43
to a certain degree but yeah that's not

509.3 --> 513.95
for everyone you can't just tell a

511.43 --> 517.67
random person who's still in the system

513.95 --> 519.32
to just do that because yeah you also

517.67 --> 524.24
have to tell them about all the other

519.32 --> 526.49
consequences that come with it and he

524.24 --> 528.47
doesn't do that because oh yeah don't be

526.49 --> 530.9300000000001
a [ __ ] don't be a [ __ ] yeah you're

528.47 --> 534.0500000000001
gonna get into arguments non-stop you're

530.93 --> 537.1999999999999
gonna constantly be harassed by police

534.05 --> 539.39
and [ __ ] and yeah you're gonna be more

537.2 --> 542.09
complaining like oh the system so sucks

539.39 --> 544.1
yeah why do you think that is I know I

542.09 --> 548.5300000000001
know it shouldn't be that way but that's

544.1 --> 553.49
how it works and what he's doing isn't

548.53 --> 556.85
changing it not really he is avoiding it

553.49 --> 558.74
it's maybe giving an example but at the

556.85 --> 565.52
same time he's not very nice person so

558.74 --> 569.45
that example isn't very good not

565.52 --> 571.93
partaking in the system it's only really

569.45 --> 576.5600000000001
gonna be functional when it is done on a

571.93 --> 580.1899999999999
on a wider more public scale like in the

576.56 --> 581.51
direct response the group if you're just

580.19 --> 583.99
gonna stay out of everything and

581.51 --> 586.49
basically not be on the radar anywhere

583.99 --> 588.5600000000001
yeah you're not gonna have any influence

586.49 --> 591.74
the government's still going to keep on

588.56 --> 593.6899999999999
doing what its gonna be doing yeah it

591.74 --> 596.21
may not be getting your tax money or

593.69 --> 599.84
whatever I don't know if you pay taxes

596.21 --> 600.96
or not you suggest you give the

599.84 --> 604.73
impression you don't

600.96 --> 611.88
I don't really care it's your business

604.73 --> 613.74
but ya know participating is not gonna

611.88 --> 616.35
get that gun run away they're not gonna

613.74 --> 622.86
fall because you don't pay so many

616.35 --> 625.89
people yeah as I said it's a difficult

622.86 --> 628.26
dilemma and it only really works when a

625.89 --> 632.51
lot of people do it so that can actually

628.26 --> 635.55
be felt and yeah you're gonna have some

632.51 --> 637.38
effects like the more people there the

635.55 --> 642.24
bigger the threat the more likely there

637.38 --> 645.959
are to be raids to be autocratic

642.24 --> 648.839
measures to counter it so you also got

645.959 --> 651.66
to keep that in mind and I don't even

648.839 --> 654.149
know why I am giving him advice at this

651.66 --> 657.74
point I hope that you're gonna take this

654.149 --> 661.17
advice when you think about what he does

657.74 --> 663.99
it's just not so simple as this over

661.17 --> 672.4499999999999
generalization over simplification it is

663.99 --> 680.76
the the bane of progress of any type any

672.45 --> 684.24
type in any region so if you diplomat

680.76 --> 690.05
sense memetics good to see you in chat

684.24 --> 695.61
spherical cow Jose Gonzales to see you

690.05 --> 698.0
and track Matic so yeah I got a pretty

695.61 --> 701.279
good chat here

698.0 --> 701.279
[Music]

702.58 --> 712.5200000000001
so yeah that happened and I'll see what

709.04 --> 716.9
goes I don't know I think at this point

712.52 --> 721.61
I pretty much consider freaking go as

716.9 --> 724.0699999999999
another flavor of PJ and though they're

721.61 --> 726.89
very different not really comparable

724.07 --> 730.69
they are pretty much isolated in their

726.89 --> 733.4
own ways and they are antisocial

730.69 --> 737.6600000000001
exceptionally antisocial in their own

733.4 --> 739.79
unique different ways so yeah it's just

737.66 --> 741.41
gonna be be Shay is gonna be doing what

739.79 --> 742.91
he does and what he's always been doing

741.41 --> 745.3399999999999
and if you can go he's gonna be doing

742.91 --> 747.53
what he's always been doing or he's

745.34 --> 749.48
gonna get too sick of it and drown in

747.53 --> 753.41
his own negativity and just leave the

749.48 --> 756.9200000000001
scene PJ is probably never gonna leave

753.41 --> 759.3199999999999
the scene because he's too addicted to

756.92 --> 761.75
attention and he is kind of amusing so

759.32 --> 766.97
you always get some attention no matter

761.75 --> 769.25
how ridiculous he is although when he

766.97 --> 773.1800000000001
gets totally whiny and complainy that's

769.25 --> 774.8
not really interesting but he doesn't do

773.18 --> 782.1099999999999
that all the time the vegan guy gets

774.8 --> 793.06
agitated and offensive all that time all

782.11 --> 795.32
so if I'm not enough about that you know

793.06 --> 798.7399999999999
already keep some doing what he does

795.32 --> 802.7900000000001
they do and I'm gonna keep on doing what

798.74 --> 804.89
I do and I'm really much more interested

802.79 --> 806.78
here in the people in chat that I have a

804.89 --> 809.93
lot of interesting things to say I

806.78 --> 812.3299999999999
already invited then you'll feel to come

809.93 --> 814.4
on my show and said you considered it

812.33 --> 817.61
but he's at the phone and doesn't have

814.4 --> 821.26
Skype but yeah we'll be really cool to

817.61 --> 825.02
have him in to talk some about these

821.26 --> 829.16
about the Akashic record and about the

825.02 --> 831.1999999999999
MT and I think he has had experiences

829.16 --> 835.1
with them probably a lot more pleasant

831.2 --> 835.76
than mine and yeah I have no problem

835.1 --> 839.21
talking

835.76 --> 844.64
about this as long as the context is to

839.21 --> 847.3100000000001
be very very careful and don't you know

844.64 --> 854.59
especially don't do this when you're not

847.31 --> 858.3399999999999
an adult it is it has so much impact

854.59 --> 860.8100000000001
when you're young it did with me and

858.34 --> 863.33
when you're young you just don't have

860.81 --> 866.15
the skills to deal with the experience

863.33 --> 872.2700000000001
and what it does to you and that is

866.15 --> 874.76
dangerous so I'll always keep on whining

872.27 --> 880.5799999999999
about this for as long as I publicly

874.76 --> 883.22
speak so you know you know not gonna say

880.58 --> 884.21
it's doing nothing it's just the devil

883.22 --> 888.2900000000001
bla bla bla

884.21 --> 892.3000000000001
no but it is dangerous it should not be

888.29 --> 901.31
illegal in my opinion but it is a

892.3 --> 903.0799999999999
dangerous thing potentially so you got

901.31 --> 907.88
to know what you're doing before you

903.08 --> 914.7700000000001
start to do it in this in general that's

907.88 --> 914.77
good advice but with so

921.87 --> 925.88
see what you got something bad

941.349 --> 945.849
okay this is hilarious

947.499 --> 960.4390000000001
yeah nerd the word nerd I don't know I I

952.22 --> 964.3090000000001
used it and yeah in my time people said

960.439 --> 971.029
nerd a lot and I don't know it's just

964.309 --> 976.0989999999999
ingrained from my teenage times in my in

971.029 --> 978.709
my labeling system you could call it but

976.099 --> 980.4490000000001
yeah it doesn't have the giant negative

978.709 --> 983.3889999999999
connotations I don't look down upon

980.449 --> 985.909
nerds but I do recognize that people

983.389 --> 989.019
that could be considered nurse usually

985.909 --> 992.299
fall into a certain spectrum of problems

989.019 --> 996.169
personal often social related problems

992.299 --> 999.919
and yeah that's I don't know it's just a

996.169 --> 1002.439
type I have no problems with them

999.919 --> 1006.549
although some nerds especially the more

1002.439 --> 1011.529
hyperactive ones can be quite a chore to

1006.549 --> 1015.8389999999999
end your yeah but yeah especially as

1011.529 --> 1019.059
they get older and they don't slow down

1015.839 --> 1024.009
they know that about themselves and they

1019.059 --> 1027.279
will try to spare people off their

1024.009 --> 1029.409
gibbering or their ramblings I know in

1027.279 --> 1038.019
that sense I am kind of a nerd as well

1029.409 --> 1040.029
but for me it's different because I had

1038.019 --> 1042.069
a lot of trouble really talking and

1040.029 --> 1047.079
explaining myself when I was younger so

1042.069 --> 1050.08
I'm almost like allowing myself or even

1047.079 --> 1052.6589999999999
pushing myself to just move beyond and

1050.08 --> 1054.549
to keep on rambling and now I have a

1052.659 --> 1059.529
show so I also have to keep on rambling

1054.549 --> 1062.95
so yeah I guess some of that nerd that

1059.529 --> 1067.99
was hidden in a way in me in silence is

1062.95 --> 1070.779
coming out a little more yeah my parents

1067.99 --> 1072.519
my brother who I did talk to a lot

1070.779 --> 1072.85
because I really trusted them from

1072.519 --> 1076.21
pretty

1072.85 --> 1080.77
early on I say I'd say like since was 10

1076.21 --> 1083.049
or 12 not 10 they do know I am a nerd

1080.77 --> 1085.809
and they always wants to ask every

1083.049 --> 1088.96
freaking detail about everything until

1085.809 --> 1091.9289999999999
my attention just ran off because it was

1088.96 --> 1093.8500000000001
kind of hyperactive and that was very

1091.929 --> 1097.8700000000001
annoying for them as well because they

1093.85 --> 1100.36
had the first obliged and then get

1097.87 --> 1102.76
really into subject details and then

1100.36 --> 1104.1999999999998
when I got yeah halfway or

1102.76 --> 1106.48
three-quarters of the way of their

1104.2 --> 1109.419
explanation I would just I know enough

1106.48 --> 1113.1100000000001
and then walk off that's really freaking

1109.419 --> 1122.38
annoying when people do that but yeah I

1113.11 --> 1126.27
do when I look back at who I was man no

1122.38 --> 1129.5200000000002
wonder I barely had any friends it's

1126.27 --> 1132.34
it's really weird now because when I

1129.52 --> 1134.26
socialize now when I walk do things meet

1132.34 --> 1136.059
people even the way I look and I didn't

1134.26 --> 1140.799
look that extreme when I was young I

1136.059 --> 1144.97
really started like after my 20s when I

1140.799 --> 1146.5
was really young I be intolerable from

1144.97 --> 1148.409
it and I and I didn't know how to

1146.5 --> 1150.64
properly socialize and communicate

1148.409 --> 1155.95
didn't have the right attitude to know

1150.64 --> 1158.8300000000002
how to just the back and forth and yeah

1155.95 --> 1161.46
some traces of that still leaked through

1158.83 --> 1171.76
in heavy stressful situations

1161.46 --> 1174.45
unfortunately but and now I have so much

1171.76 --> 1179.289
more social skills but intuitively

1174.45 --> 1182.1100000000001
there's I'm still also my teen himself I

1179.289 --> 1185.47
remember all that I remember so much of

1182.11 --> 1187.3899999999999
my social experience and insight in the

1185.47 --> 1189.039
world is still based on that although

1187.39 --> 1193.179
I've learned so much more on top of it

1189.039 --> 1196.289
and it's really weird to me that it's

1193.179 --> 1201.7900000000002
pretty easy for me to make friends now

1196.289 --> 1204.22
if I wanted to that's the thing I'm so

1201.79 --> 1205.82
used to being pretty much on my own a

1204.22 --> 1208.04
lot of the time

1205.82 --> 1209.81
and I don't have much social stamina to

1208.04 --> 1213.8799999999999
be around a lot of people all the time

1209.81 --> 1216.8899999999999
so I do get saturated by other people

1213.88 --> 1221.21
relatively quickly for an average human

1216.89 --> 1223.73
being also because I just get so much

1221.21 --> 1228.26
more information from people in the same

1223.73 --> 1232.55
time span that I yeah that makes that

1228.26 --> 1235.55
saturation just go quicker so the

1232.55 --> 1239.78
problem now is that like yeah who do I

1235.55 --> 1241.79
pick to be my friends that's like the

1239.78 --> 1244.1
roles have reversed and it's really odd

1241.79 --> 1248.6599999999999
it's surreal to me because I'm usually

1244.1 --> 1253.8799999999999
that was so desperate he's younger to be

1248.66 --> 1256.28
liked and all that [ __ ] and now yeah

1253.88 --> 1259.7
things worked out really surprisingly

1256.28 --> 1262.36
well for myself and I'm very happy that

1259.7 --> 1262.3600000000001
they have

1272.43 --> 1275.76
something's burning

1278.38 --> 1299.3200000000002
[Music]

1286.35 --> 1302.02
that happens yeah when they go past you

1299.32 --> 1317.32
hear it very hard right through the

1302.02 --> 1319.33
walls T yeah the yellow fest riots yeah

1317.32 --> 1321.37
it's going heavy in France apparently

1319.33 --> 1327.25
and they're not conceding to anything at

1321.37 --> 1330.04
this point and I've been hearing there's

1327.25 --> 1335.61
also yellow vests in the Netherlands and

1330.04 --> 1340.42
other countries and I wish I had some

1335.61 --> 1343.06
more to spend because I'd love to join

1340.42 --> 1346.1200000000001
them sometime I don't know if I'd like

1343.06 --> 1349.6
to even have me because they might like

1346.12 --> 1352.78
look down upon me for not having a real

1349.6 --> 1354.79
job for example I don't know if they

1352.78 --> 1357.58
told her it kind of people but I do

1354.79 --> 1362.74
really sympathize because yeah the

1357.58 --> 1366.4299999999998
government is so screwed up you know so

1362.74 --> 1369.19
I almost feel like mm-hmm I should be

1366.43 --> 1375.22
part of that so anyway yeah I support

1369.19 --> 1381.67
the yellow vests just just don't go

1375.22 --> 1385.8600000000001
ballistic but it it is necessary hey

1381.67 --> 1385.8600000000001
Adam good morning

1388.17 --> 1397.74
some L&B mmm I di

1392.1 --> 1397.74
HC chat see you

1419.06 --> 1429.71
now now Adam doesn't I Adam has a

1424.61 --> 1431.81
spanner because I absolutely trust him

1429.71 --> 1433.63
he's one of the most trustworthy persons

1431.81 --> 1437.51
I've ever met

1433.63 --> 1440.21
and I basically told him no don't edit

1437.51 --> 1444.83
anything unless it's very obvious spam

1440.21 --> 1448.48
or like total disgusting [ __ ] and he

1444.83 --> 1451.34
knows that he doesn't get personal and

1448.48 --> 1454.4
other than that hey the guy has craic

1451.34 --> 1456.35
resource so if he has like a appropriate

1454.4 --> 1459.0500000000002
link he can just put it out there in

1456.35 --> 1462.32
chat at his discretion so that's why I

1459.05 --> 1465.05
gave Adam the spanner or rather I didn't

1462.32 --> 1468.5
take it away from him and so goes with

1465.05 --> 1473.0
Nathan he Nathan knows rules so you know

1468.5 --> 1475.82
he wants he foolish with it and yeah he

1473.0 --> 1479.27

1475.82 --> 1481.84
for him for his shows and absolutely

1479.27 --> 1486.02
find them and my show is basically in

1481.84 --> 1489.1999999999998

1486.02 --> 1491.3799999999999
so yeah of course I giving him a link

1489.2 --> 1496.16
and I trust him

1491.38 --> 1502.0100000000002

1496.16 --> 1504.44
trollish every now and then hmm but yeah

1502.01 --> 1506.75

1550.39 --> 1555.5
friendship hostility going but I don't

1555.5 --> 1561.68
I take it I'll put his name in it and he

1558.41 --> 1565.67
can still be an ass to me if he likes or

1561.68 --> 1567.5600000000002
being funny that's no problem he can be

1565.67 --> 1571.0700000000002

Thanks

1675.45 --> 1682.05
so yeah good to hear so not wanting to

1680.61 --> 1684.4499999999998
push but the sooner the better

1682.05 --> 1686.58
if I could get it today then I could

1684.45 --> 1690.3
have a title cart at the start of the

1686.58 --> 1697.8899999999999
next shelf laterthe earlybird 35 so that

1690.3 --> 1699.33
would be really cool but yeah whenever

1697.89 --> 1713.3700000000001
possible

1699.33 --> 1717.1799999999998
sooner the better oh I wish I wish I

1713.37 --> 1722.58
could just talk about D&D a lot and that

1717.18 --> 1726.24
you will guys would love it I know that

1722.58 --> 1729.36
it's just not that interesting to most

1726.24 --> 1735.41
of you but yeah I'm working so much with

1729.36 --> 1738.8999999999999
like I don't play a lot like I play like

1735.41 --> 1740.52
every two weeks on average sometimes

1738.9 --> 1742.91
quicker if the players and have a lot of

1740.52 --> 1745.8899999999999
time and they are they are really

1742.91 --> 1748.77
addicted so they some of them are just

1745.89 --> 1751.26
like the first possible opportunity no

1748.77 --> 1753.6
matter what like really fanatically they

1751.26 --> 1756.78
want this game and I love it because I

1753.6 --> 1760.08
feel the same but yeah in between I have

1756.78 --> 1762.57
a lot of preparation time that I really

1760.08 --> 1765.8999999999999
need to work out the details and fit I

1762.57 --> 1767.1899999999998
have to scheme plans like okay they're

1765.9 --> 1769.92
gonna have to have some kind of

1767.19 --> 1773.25
opposition or some kind of events for

1769.92 --> 1776.94
them to handle and what am I gonna throw

1773.25 --> 1783.18
at them and what angle like a mystery or

1776.94 --> 1790.98
a combat or like a just like a bandit

1783.18 --> 1793.38
attack or maybe ship based pirate attack

1790.98 --> 1801.21
those are in this world as well

1793.38 --> 1803.18
or maybe further with a nobility related

1801.21 --> 1807.3600000000001
assassination because yeah there's also

1803.18 --> 1808.809
kind of a bit of a game of Thrones thing

1807.36 --> 1811.7199999999998
going I'm not yeah

1808.809 --> 1813.6689999999999
there's different kingdoms and nobility

1811.72 --> 1817.96
that are trying to manifest their own

1813.669 --> 1819.8200000000002
little miniature city empires that kind

1817.96 --> 1825.009
of thing so there's so much to work with

1819.82 --> 1829.629
and I am constantly just like a giant

1825.009 --> 1831.879
bag the bag of ethereal Legos just

1829.629 --> 1833.86
constantly seeing like oh what what

1831.879 --> 1835.84
could I make what could I make oh I

1833.86 --> 1840.519
could how could I put it in here this

1835.84 --> 1843.61
and have basically by now a library of

1840.519 --> 1846.249
potential characters some that I made

1843.61 --> 1849.2199999999998
really long ago that have have been in

1846.249 --> 1853.21
wait for literally over three years now

1849.22 --> 1856.45
that I made three years ago that are

1853.21 --> 1859.6000000000001
like okay I could always make that

1856.45 --> 1861.6100000000001
maneuver right now because yeah the

1859.6 --> 1863.1999999999998
players have become so much stronger it

1861.61 --> 1866.4399999999998
typically happens in Eevee

1863.2 --> 1869.6490000000001
you start out like a civilian basically

1866.44 --> 1873.0700000000002
or just a fresh noob starter and you're

1869.649 --> 1876.6999999999998
very weak and yeah by the power of

1873.07 --> 1879.009
experience and magic I guess it's kind

1876.7 --> 1880.69
of a the world is super magical so yeah

1879.009 --> 1884.049
then what

1880.69 --> 1886.0900000000001
what's the reason magic of course just

1884.049 --> 1889.389
the magic the natural magic of the realm

1886.09 --> 1891.9399999999998
and they grow and they become incredibly

1889.389 --> 1894.789
powerful until they basically can face

1891.94 --> 1899.019
off against Titans and Dragons and [ __ ]

1894.789 --> 1902.11
and like take on dragon breath without

1899.019 --> 1904.36
just instantly dying in that ship and

1902.11 --> 1907.57
they become so incredibly strong it's

1904.36 --> 1909.1899999999998
just beyond Hercules proportions but

1907.57 --> 1911.049
yeah I have to keep on building the

1909.19 --> 1912.97
challenge for them and the challenges

1911.049 --> 1914.32
have to be stronger and stronger so the

1912.97 --> 1919.45
opponents have to be stronger and

1914.32 --> 1922.869
stronger and I somehow have to also give

1919.45 --> 1926.3500000000001
them a reason to be that strong in the

1922.869 --> 1930.58
world like okay this is a super mighty

1926.35 --> 1932.86
rope thingy creature yeah it's not just

1930.58 --> 1934.99
gonna be like that when it was born so I

1932.86 --> 1936.519
have to give it kind of a beckster what

1934.99 --> 1938.23
has it been doing to get all that

1936.519 --> 1941.019
experience and all that loot that it's

1938.23 --> 1942.19
using so every time there's a bigger

1941.019 --> 1945.279
character after that

1942.19 --> 1947.679
or history for it more quickly made

1945.279 --> 1952.509
background story basically that has to

1947.679 --> 1958.0900000000001
fit the world so yeah D&D game mustering

1952.509 --> 1960.789
it is a fast fast hobby and to some

1958.09 --> 1963.9399999999998
people it's just like how can you keep

1960.789 --> 1966.639
track of all that [ __ ] with so much in

1963.94 --> 1968.409
your head because they can't some people

1966.639 --> 1969.9699999999998
just can't they just don't have the

1968.409 --> 1970.3600000000001
oversight to deal with something like

1969.97 --> 1976.09
this

1970.36 --> 1978.34
I think yeah that's they just can't do

1976.09 --> 1981.1
it but others yeah they can do it they

1978.34 --> 1983.59
can do it to some degree some use very

1981.1 --> 1986.32
being extremely systematic with

1983.59 --> 1988.809
everything and planning it ahead and

1986.32 --> 1995.9189999999999
just following the system that they've

1988.809 --> 1998.83
built and yeah that that does yield a

1995.919 --> 2001.1390000000001
pretty decent game when you do that but

1998.83 --> 2002.85
there will be a lot of hiccups here and

2001.139 --> 2005.6999999999998
there or unexpected things that happen

2002.85 --> 2007.5
that you don't have read yeah that they

2005.7 --> 2008.909
don't have an answer to it so just like

2007.5 --> 2014.879
okay just move on

2008.909 --> 2016.95
I literally improvise almost every

2014.879 --> 2019.7099999999998
single step of the way and that means

2016.95 --> 2022.0800000000002
with the entire swing of what could

2019.71 --> 2024.75
happen every time because it is up to

2022.08 --> 2028.58
the players and I really give them that

2024.75 --> 2031.44
absolute choice destiny freedom although

2028.58 --> 2034.379
it has to make sense to their characters

2031.44 --> 2037.049
but yeah their characters are chaotic

2034.379 --> 2040.34
neutral and chaotic neutral pretty much

2037.049 --> 2044.19
means totally in predictable

2040.34 --> 2050.429
anti-authoritarian so yeah once you've

2044.19 --> 2052.909
eaten goys but a little more funny I'm

2050.429 --> 2058.26
gonna have the craziest wildest

2052.909 --> 2061.26
adventures and crazy social interactions

2058.26 --> 2065.01
and sexual stuff even yeah I don't know

2061.26 --> 2068.3100000000004
it's part of their identity they're into

2065.01 --> 2071.5200000000004
that liberal and I I do find it amusing

2068.31 --> 2073.29
what that's the things that do happen

2071.52 --> 2075.11
because of this it it makes an

2073.29 --> 2076.6
interesting story funnily enough

2075.11 --> 2082.94
because I do write it down every now

2076.6 --> 2088.13
like every time it's like 300 pages now

2082.94 --> 2089.69
this story may be even more it's big but

2088.13 --> 2094.25
it keeps on going they're not even

2089.69 --> 2099.01
halfway yeah that's the indeed a real

2094.25 --> 2101.99
big D&D campaign can last 10 years and

2099.01 --> 2104.21
if the game master is like making its

2101.99 --> 2107.0899999999997
life dedication yeah it can literally go

2104.21 --> 2113.02
on forever there's gamers out there that

2107.09 --> 2122.63
have been playing one game for 30 years

2113.02 --> 2126.68
yeah can you imagine that that's aa long

2122.63 --> 2129.44
although could be argue yes my brother

2126.68 --> 2132.71
they also did another type of game

2129.44 --> 2135.4700000000003
similar to the indie and he did that for

2132.71 --> 2138.23
eight years but yeah they played every

2135.47 --> 2140.9599999999996
two or three months it's really

2138.23 --> 2143.84
different when you do it like that we my

2140.96 --> 2151.13
group plays every two weeks for years

2143.84 --> 2156.53
now no three years three years a long

2151.13 --> 2158.06
time and it's awesome it's my first

2156.53 --> 2159.98
series the indie group I had a little

2158.06 --> 2163.85
one right before that but one of the

2159.98 --> 2168.26
players we really had like he was this

2163.85 --> 2174.44
weird old liberal weird a hipster type

2168.26 --> 2176.78
and yeah I was just getting into

2174.44 --> 2178.82
basically being more Christian and he

2176.78 --> 2180.17
hated that so we didn't get along and

2178.82 --> 2182.06
like after half a year and that's

2180.17 --> 2184.28
preaches pretty long we got in such a

2182.06 --> 2187.43
heavy fight online that they just

2184.28 --> 2189.53
stopped so then I got this group and I

2187.43 --> 2191.69
like this one a lot better although the

2189.53 --> 2193.4900000000002
previous one did have potential but you

2191.69 --> 2196.94
couldn't get along that's also a problem

2193.49 --> 2199.0099999999998
you know in the gamer circles there's a

2196.94 --> 2201.59
lot of nerds and especially the

2199.01 --> 2204.8900000000003
intelligent ones they have character

2201.59 --> 2208.1000000000004
issues and that means they often don't

2204.89 --> 2208.91
get along with others off especially

2208.1 --> 2213.08
better

2208.91 --> 2214.52
also intelligent competing thingy I'm

2213.08 --> 2217.37
smarter than you I'm smarter than you

2214.52 --> 2220.97
I'm the boss no I'm the boss that kind

2217.37 --> 2224.54
of [ __ ] so yeah and I don't have that in

2220.97 --> 2227.9599999999996
this group thank God although they are

2224.54 --> 2231.82
especially one guys like oh he is so

2227.96 --> 2236.18
long in love with the globe hmm

2231.82 --> 2239.84
but it's not that bad he's a very very

2236.18 --> 2243.5
likable funny and social and tolerant

2239.84 --> 2245.21
guy he I he knows how I think and feel

2243.5 --> 2248.09
about things we had really personal

2245.21 --> 2255.67
talks and he's a he's just a good guy

2248.09 --> 2258.29
but it's just so liberal it's like a

2255.67 --> 2260.96
little bit too liberal to be sensible

2258.29 --> 2264.77
for me but absolutely not social justice

2260.96 --> 2269.06
where you level thank God no not not

2264.77 --> 2275.5
that bad I guess he's Swedish I guess

2269.06 --> 2278.06
he's just typically Swedish yeah yes

2275.5 --> 2280.88
yeah you have to know the Swedes to know

2278.06 --> 2283.42
how they are and they're very very very

2280.88 --> 2288.5
tolerant and liberal on averaging

2283.42 --> 2291.89
welcoming and selfless sometimes up to

2288.5 --> 2294.08
in his insane proportions others are

2291.89 --> 2296.48
really egotistical so there's a contrast

2294.08 --> 2298.73
and that of course with all the

2296.48 --> 2307.34
Scandinavian countries that contrasts

2298.73 --> 2309.44
very much present anyway yeah I still

2307.34 --> 2313.31
really like that guy and he is a

2309.44 --> 2315.4700000000003
fantastic player role plays really cool

2313.31 --> 2319.07
really one character place is really

2315.47 --> 2322.6699999999996
charismatic Bard halfling like a bard

2319.07 --> 2328.4
hobbit and he doesn't sound so good any

2322.67 --> 2333.26
even sometimes kind of like seats live

2328.4 --> 2335.06
that's really funny it's just yeah not

2333.26 --> 2338.3900000000003
like real performance singing but just

2335.06 --> 2341.0499999999997
yeah the character sings and so then he

2338.39 --> 2343.12
also does

2341.05 --> 2350.8900000000003
it's funny and like it role-playing is

2343.12 --> 2354.25
such a great hobby and you always pretty

2350.89 --> 2357.64
much end up either splitting up or being

2354.25 --> 2359.5
the best of friends ever because you get

2357.64 --> 2363.2799999999997
to know each other from so many angles

2359.5 --> 2367.0
you get really get to know how we how

2363.28 --> 2369.19
are the other things cuz she just get

2367.0 --> 2370.99
together with your mind so many times in

2369.19 --> 2373.68
this and you just figure out how they

2370.99 --> 2375.1
think how they work how they reason and

2373.68 --> 2379.21
it's awesome

2375.1 --> 2389.2599999999998
so sorry D&D I did talk about it for 10

2379.21 --> 2396.2200000000003
minutes the easiest possible and making

2389.26 --> 2397.8300000000004
characters is also awesome something

2396.22 --> 2401.9399999999996
else

2397.83 --> 2401.94
yeah flat earth

2408.49 --> 2412.54
Construction is not curvature

2412.6 --> 2418.93
terrestrial refraction ISM complete

2416.06 --> 2418.93
fabrication

2426.2 --> 2432.769
having the body's not physical I love to

2431.059 --> 2433.9700000000003
say that every time I see some article

2432.769 --> 2436.7
like ooh

2433.97 --> 2439.25
maybe the American astronauts haven't

2436.7 --> 2444.069
been to the moon after all in in a

2439.25 --> 2447.5
typical sub mainstream alternative

2444.069 --> 2449.8089999999997
article somewhere and I'll just post

2447.5 --> 2451.519
there yeah nobody land in the moon

2449.809 --> 2453.71
because the moon is not a physical place

2451.519 --> 2459.2
you can land on it's just part of the

2453.71 --> 2462.589
heavenly bodies that can be all oh yeah

2459.2 --> 2466.069
observe like a hologram by the observers

2462.589 --> 2470.69
it's always funny because almost nobody

2466.069 --> 2474.049
is prepared to read that these people it

2470.69 --> 2475.849
is not aimed at this it's so I don't

2474.049 --> 2478.49
know it works well I always get

2475.849 --> 2480.6800000000003
elaborate responses and the funny thing

2478.49 --> 2484.1299999999997
is if I just mention it like that

2480.68 --> 2486.74
I don't even have to involve the shape

2484.13 --> 2489.26
of the earth entirely they can even

2486.74 --> 2495.14
believe that the world is a globe and

2489.26 --> 2498.039
that still be the case so I like doing

2495.14 --> 2498.0389999999998
that I like

2501.17 --> 2512.6800000000003
oh my god Flat Earth is a Saudi saya Wow

2509.68 --> 2512.68
Wow

2513.039 --> 2516.9500000000003
dude you really gotta explain that one

2516.349 --> 2529.299
to me

2516.95 --> 2548.0789999999997
oh wow oh look who's that this foxnews

2529.299 --> 2554.63
fake news I have the evil Legolas okay

2548.079 --> 2560.26
sure I don't know I don't know what I'd

2554.63 --> 2560.26
ever done to be evil though you know

2576.85 --> 2587.2
oh yes and by the way Jose I did not

2585.1 --> 2592.33
send our circus

2587.2 --> 2595.87
I swear no I I don't mention that it's

2592.33 --> 2599.5
not really relevant you know although it

2595.87 --> 2603.3399999999997
could be she actually except first that

2599.5 --> 2605.47
it is holographic element then you can

2603.34 --> 2607.33
speculate on the nature of it and who

2605.47 --> 2609.6299999999997
knows if somebody is going to engage

2607.33 --> 2612.9
with me in a conversation of that I

2609.63 --> 2616.96
might actually bring up peaches

2612.9 --> 2621.67
Aristarchus theory which as I said

2616.96 --> 2624.85
before he may have very good points he's

2621.67 --> 2629.07
an idiot but he may be an idiot that

2624.85 --> 2630.31
just happened to be on the right track

2629.07 --> 2632.26
yeah

2630.31 --> 2634.39
constantly whining about it and

2632.26 --> 2638.59
obsessing over it however is not gonna

2634.39 --> 2641.85
help progress confirming it that's

2638.59 --> 2650.8900000000003
another matter but yeah maybe he is

2641.85 --> 2654.73
right in some strange momentary idiot

2650.89 --> 2659.14
savant kind of way maybe he did had like

2654.73 --> 2664.48
a remarkable vision thing and he just

2659.14 --> 2666.8199999999997
saw that like I don't know maybe he is

2664.48 --> 2670.09
right in that aspect to a certain point

2666.82 --> 2673.23
I don't know could be so I will not

2670.09 --> 2676.96
exclude it but yeah I'm not gonna be a

2673.23 --> 2678.94
peach shade jr. and obsess over that

2676.96 --> 2681.04
[ __ ] as he would love you would love

2678.94 --> 2685.09
everyone to constantly talk about

2681.04 --> 2687.82
Aristarchus all day one in the world

2685.09 --> 2695.4300000000003
must be upset with her darkest that's

2687.82 --> 2698.7400000000002
what he wants not gonna do it hmm Oh

2695.43 --> 2703.99
chocolate Shane that is so funny that

2698.74 --> 2707.41
you mention it he says Arwen we can

2703.99 --> 2710.2599999999998
debate dragon ball versus D&D or guess

2707.41 --> 2714.04
what I actually made a

2710.26 --> 2716.9700000000003
the prestige class that pretty much

2714.04 --> 2721.09
turns you into a Dragonball Z character

2716.97 --> 2725.41
it gives you a default it's a crossover

2721.09 --> 2728.7400000000002
between a cleric and a monk and it gives

2725.41 --> 2735.16
you flying abilities and super punching

2728.74 --> 2738.58
and energy blasts so yeah if you like

2735.16 --> 2740.77
DME and you want to play or if you like

2738.58 --> 2743.89
Dragon Ball Z and you want to play the

2740.77 --> 2747.39
indie you can have a sort of Dragon Ball

2743.89 --> 2752.41
Z character in my daily game if you like

2747.39 --> 2754.75
that's possible it happen and I also

2752.41 --> 2757.1499999999996
kind of included a Pirates of the

2754.75 --> 2763.51
Caribbean Thai prestige class where you

2757.15 --> 2767.6800000000003
can get like turn into an undead pirate

2763.51 --> 2770.26
ship figure or a outerworld monstrous

2767.68 --> 2773.5299999999997
pirate ship figure or you can turn into

2770.26 --> 2777.2200000000003
an almost Peter Pan setting like pirate

2773.53 --> 2780.3700000000003
figure so yeah I integrated a lot of

2777.22 --> 2783.3399999999997
[ __ ] in my D&D because it's cool and

2780.37 --> 2785.7999999999997
people like that kind of [ __ ] they liked

2783.34 --> 2788.5

2972.64 --> 2976.7799999999997
in the D in the world and imaginable

2975.85 --> 2981.9
amounts I

2976.78 --> 2985.96
on this game for twenty years and I have

2981.9 --> 2989.28
no outlook of ever getting an overview

2985.96 --> 2996.2200000000003
of what the totality of it is because

2989.28 --> 3003.1800000000003
there's so much it's just insane but I

2996.22 --> 3013.02
do know a lot of it right so guess that

3003.18 --> 3017.24
was that - take a look it's at sea yeah

3013.02 --> 3021.12
traulsen tyrants dot wordpress.com

3017.24 --> 3022.77
that's where it is if you want to check

3021.12 --> 3025.68
it out if you want to look through some

3022.77 --> 3028.92
D&D [ __ ] get a feel for it whatever

3025.68 --> 3031.0499999999997
you're curious you're all fan you know

3028.92 --> 3036.4500000000003
what if you are D&D player out there

3031.05 --> 3039.03
that uses a three point five system you

3036.45 --> 3040.68
can use this that is the older D&D

3039.03 --> 3042.9900000000002
system by the way there's a lot of D&D

3040.68 --> 3044.8199999999997
four and five being played which are

3042.99 --> 3049.08
completely different totally different

3044.82 --> 3052.13
systems and they are decent I really

3049.08 --> 3055.5299999999997
like 3.5 because it is insanely

3052.13 --> 3058.8900000000003
extensive and this version trolls and

3055.53 --> 3067.59
tyrants basically called it D in D 3

3058.89 --> 3068.58
point 8 yeah free point but again three

3067.59 --> 3072.3
point eight seven

3068.58 --> 3074.43
right because it is still the indie

3072.3 --> 3077.34
three it's the three point five version

3074.43 --> 3080.2799999999997
but up created significantly overhauled

3077.34 --> 3082.38
and it is compatible with all three

3080.28 --> 3084.5400000000004
point five materials so you can just if

3082.38 --> 3086.76
you want look in here see like oh I

3084.54 --> 3091.74
really think this is cool you can use

3086.76 --> 3094.4100000000003
that in your 3.5 game as a game master

3091.74 --> 3096.8999999999996
or as a player but yeah you need to ask

3094.41 --> 3099.12
permission from your game master if

3096.9 --> 3106.23
you're going to use unknown materials of

3099.12 --> 3109.069
course so anyway ma'am filled up 2025

3106.23 --> 3112.049
minutes with you need that's crazy

3109.069 --> 3117.089
hmm it's part of me

3112.049 --> 3119.519
I like the in the world Society building

3117.089 --> 3123.63
learning experimenting storyline

3119.519 --> 3126.39
creating it's all of that all of that in

3123.63 --> 3130.049
one and you learn an incredible amount

3126.39 --> 3134.549
of things you learn about pragmatic

3130.049 --> 3137.999
situations in movies things are 10

3134.549 --> 3142.049
movies and series especially actual

3137.999 --> 3146.8089999999997
scenarios tend to be tuned down or toned

3142.049 --> 3149.4
down to fit the structure and yeah

3146.809 --> 3151.259
especially smart people often when they

3149.4 --> 3153.71
watch things they're just complaining

3151.259 --> 3157.079
like that this is not a logical choice

3153.71 --> 3158.729
this form of reasoning sounds on the

3157.079 --> 3159.989
surface kind of reasonable but when you

3158.729 --> 3162.66
really think about it it's kind of

3159.989 --> 3166.7690000000002
stupid a really smart person would never

3162.66 --> 3169.71
do that like you would yeah and some

3166.769 --> 3171.269
series and movies do get this completely

3169.71 --> 3174.93
right but that's pretty rare it's

3171.269 --> 3176.9689999999996
usually the more simple basic story type

3174.93 --> 3179.3999999999996
thing with stereotyped characters and

3176.969 --> 3183.569
they make stupid decisions based on

3179.4 --> 3189.1800000000003
faulty reasoning or just superficial

3183.569 --> 3191.609
reasoning and by having really smart

3189.18 --> 3194.0989999999997
players being the decision makers of

3191.609 --> 3197.069
what is gonna happen in the story based

3194.099 --> 3200.94
you with the characters you are forced

3197.069 --> 3205.739
to adapt and keep entertaining a story

3200.94 --> 3209.009
to them as well as the reader on a very

3205.739 --> 3212.64
smart level with real seriously

3209.009 --> 3215.309
pragmatic choices and often moral

3212.64 --> 3217.17
boundaries surpassing pragmatically

3215.309 --> 3219.96
forced choices that country and I do

3217.17 --> 3222.599
force them into this on on purpose to

3219.96 --> 3225.42
test I put them in impossible situations

3222.599 --> 3228.21
whether to choose between two evils that

3225.42 --> 3230.279
kind of thing and then give them the

3228.21 --> 3232.229
proper time to deal with it and reflect

3230.279 --> 3234.93
on it and potentially change their

3232.229 --> 3237.3289999999997
characters all that make it into a real

3234.93 --> 3239.7
character development a real serious

3237.329 --> 3241.8300000000004
character development and that's good

3239.7 --> 3246.35
stuff and it reflects our

3241.83 --> 3249.72
on the story that I write down I do

3246.35 --> 3252.24
write down important thoughts or

3249.72 --> 3254.04
character contemplations if they're

3252.24 --> 3258.54
important to the development of the

3254.04 --> 3260.79
story in the story no I don't just draw

3258.54 --> 3263.19
report like oh they do this they don't

3260.79 --> 3268.77
that this happens that happens it's not

3263.19 --> 3270.69
like a no just a couple of notes of

3268.77 --> 3273.0
what's going on I really presented in

3270.69 --> 3278.67
story format so yeah if you want to read

3273.0 --> 3284.19
that then you can go to trolls and

3278.67 --> 3290.76
tyrants at meetup.com show you some of

3284.19 --> 3296.04
that let's see it's not such an easy

3290.76 --> 3298.4100000000003
link oh by the way I'll give out the

3296.04 --> 3298.95
trolls and tyrunt's link in the chat as

3298.41 --> 3303.29
well

3298.95 --> 3313.2
I forgot to do that I just presented

3303.29 --> 3317.19

3317.19 --> 3335.13
present and yeah i'll yeah i'll link you

3327.44 --> 3341.27
know to episode 88 let me delete this

3335.13 --> 3348.87
one it's not good and here you can see

3341.27 --> 3350.79
part of typical story and it'll read

3348.87 --> 3353.5499999999997
really weird because yeah there is

3350.79 --> 3359.15
actually now a fairy which is like a

3353.55 --> 3359.15
small human with wings in the party and

3359.27 --> 3363.99
all the characters are pretty weird and

3362.1 --> 3368.63
unique in their own way it's it's a

3363.99 --> 3373.1899999999996
ragtag band like even worse than the

3368.63 --> 3376.08
what is it the from

3373.19 --> 3378.42
the Fellowship of the Ring which was

3376.08 --> 3379.98
considered pretty odd have been all the

3378.42 --> 3382.31
different races well here they're like

3379.98 --> 3386.04
really freaking weirdos

3382.31 --> 3388.83
because yeah it's not that uncommon that

3386.04 --> 3391.44
different races cooperate it's not usual

3388.83 --> 3395.8199999999997
in this world but yeah they are truly

3391.44 --> 3400.14
weirdos like a half-orc half elf a fairy

3395.82 --> 3405.4500000000003
a female dwarf that with a beard that's

3400.14 --> 3408.74
very dominant and a halfling part which

3405.45 --> 3411.27
is kind of be more calm yeah the more

3408.74 --> 3414.4799999999996
sensible character among them all and

3411.27 --> 3417.78
the diplomat so that's very useful they

3414.48 --> 3419.13
still have a good face character but

3417.78 --> 3422.0400000000004
they're a weird Bunch

3419.13 --> 3424.609
all of them so yeah if you want to read

3422.04 --> 3428.2799999999997
some story you can look into this and

3424.609 --> 3432.42
yeah you yeah you have to dig back into

3428.28 --> 3436.0800000000004
the past tabletop RPG and beyond

3432.42 --> 3440.79
Utrecht group to read the other stories

3436.08 --> 3443.2799999999997
basically a new path part one up to 87

3440.79 --> 3446.07
if you want to read that I will

3443.28 --> 3448.65
eventually craft it all together into a

3446.07 --> 3450.2400000000002
book maybe a more apart book because I

3448.65 --> 3452.9700000000003
think it is really an interesting read

3450.24 --> 3454.589
but for now it's just available for free

3452.97 --> 3457.14
piece by piece

3454.589 --> 3458.849
