9.85 --> 32.78
[Music]

35.42 --> 37.480000000000004
you

45.96 --> 48.02
you

52.13 --> 60.18000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

56.28 --> 62.79
early-bird number 572 I'm your host

60.18 --> 64.89
Arwen and before we start to show please

62.79 --> 66.6
don't forget to share it on any platform

64.89 --> 68.49
you deem fit and if you haven't already

66.6 --> 70.05
subscribed to my channel and hit the

68.49 --> 72.05999999999999
bell notification so you know when I'm

70.05 --> 74.82
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

72.06 --> 77.28
Amsterdam time every day and please also

74.82 --> 80.3
do support me through the paypal patreon

77.28 --> 83.34
my GoFundMe oh wait no more funny right

80.3 --> 85.83
PayPal patreon super chat and the

83.34 --> 88.619
membership system that we much

85.83 --> 95.13
appreciated join button right oh this is

88.619 --> 98.13
too tough to do at the same time right

95.13 --> 101.33999999999999
yeah I was trying to do the early bird

98.13 --> 104.6
show intro from the ISS here but it was

101.34 --> 107.52000000000001
a little bit tough to focus on both

104.6 --> 114.06
right so the weather is pretty beautiful

107.52 --> 117.50999999999999
today yeah kind of stopped raining cuz

114.06 --> 120.27
it did rain and yeah still a lot of

117.51 --> 123.299
clouds there or chemtrails whenever that

120.27 --> 126.53999999999999
was I'm not too sure lots of cloud

123.299 --> 129.86
activity still going there's also still

126.54 --> 129.86
plenty of moist in the air

133.39 --> 142.51899999999998
but yeah still it's it's better than

136.73 --> 152.66
yesterday and I feel a little less tired

142.519 --> 158.75
than yesterday - all right but yeah in

152.66 --> 165.489
retrospect I thought that the that was

158.75 --> 177.95
pretty funny so gotta make sure that

165.489 --> 184.64000000000001
nothing starts floating away right

177.95 --> 187.569
anyway let's see who is in chat oh yeah

184.64 --> 190.069
before that I got tumeric coffee with me

187.569 --> 193.04
it's barely staying in the cup I don't

190.069 --> 194.75
know it must be the surface tension

193.04 --> 197.84
that's keeping the water together or

194.75 --> 200.38
something and the same goes for the

197.84 --> 200.38
green tea you

200.89 --> 214.80999999999997
[Music]

204.9 --> 221.58
hmm all right so anyway let's see you

214.81 --> 231.12
isn't yet a gem was first Missouri Bear

221.58 --> 231.12
Steve over macaw

234.4 --> 241.81
Tom Parker good servant Phil ko ooh yeah

240.73 --> 256.57
good to see you all

241.81 --> 258.6
Thursday and let's see do yesterday all

256.57 --> 261.28
right

258.6 --> 263.71000000000004
yeah I didn't stay up too late or rather

261.28 --> 269.61999999999995
I kind of like halfway fell asleep

263.71 --> 271.84
somewhere and then just went to bed but

269.62 --> 274.36
I'm so used to going to bed early these

271.84 --> 276.07
days that it's my real is kind of

274.36 --> 283.12
adapted to it but but that's good I'm

276.07 --> 284.86
actually happy about that right so yeah

283.12 --> 286.51
I wasn't super active on the Flat Earth

284.86 --> 290.71000000000004
to bits on that that's not entirely true

286.51 --> 294.90999999999997
but did my newspaper around somewhere in

290.71 --> 298.83
between did have a relatively long chat

294.91 --> 303.61
afterward with chocolate and Brian and

298.83 --> 307.93
that was kind of good but yeah also try

303.61 --> 312.039
to go on Jose's like a bit later well I

307.93 --> 315.33
was just trying to test the waters again

312.039 --> 315.33
and yeah

317.169 --> 324.99899999999997
I've got this guy again do I believe

321.729 --> 327.849
there is a 24-hour Arctic son never seen

324.999 --> 329.62
it I've seen a clip that was forwarded

327.849 --> 331.3
as supposed to evidence for this a long

329.62 --> 332.949
time ago was treated everywhere

331.3 --> 339.449
including Globus that's like three years

332.949 --> 346.449
ago and it was definitely not unedited

339.449 --> 350.039
so yeah I don't think so but even if

346.449 --> 353.02000000000004
there were I don't know I have no

350.039 --> 354.789
cosmogonic abased objection to that

353.02 --> 357.24899999999997
because they're all lights you know if

354.789 --> 360.599
somebody told me dude there's this place

357.249 --> 365.56
where there's two suns or like the Sun

360.599 --> 367.81
Goes Down over there and then really

365.56 --> 370.15
quickly after like after an hour it goes

367.81 --> 376.68
up right on the other side yeah I'd be

370.15 --> 376.67999999999995
like yeah dude sure that can happen oh

377.759 --> 382.509
god yeah random ex flora you already

380.71 --> 384.54999999999995
caught where was going with that josé's

382.509 --> 387.159
thing yeah I really just wanted to go on

384.55 --> 390.039
there I just see like okay

387.159 --> 391.719
and hey I was being received again in

390.039 --> 394.21
the way that I like to be received

391.719 --> 396.899
basically ballers wanting to ask me

394.21 --> 399.52
questions you know at least they try and

396.899 --> 404.139
and then right the hand just came in and

399.52 --> 405.81899999999996
started whining about how I manage my

404.139 --> 408.249
channel first about how he was

405.819 --> 413.139
supposedly banned and then I lied about

408.249 --> 414.84900000000005
it I lied it's ridiculous I I don't

413.139 --> 416.969
believe yeah it was kind of embarrassing

414.849 --> 422.71
your retrospect that I even just

416.969 --> 425.889
responded to that but yeah he you know

422.71 --> 427.659
he he wasn't he wasn't giving me

425.889 --> 429.61
anything he was just there to tear me

427.659 --> 433.18
down for no good reason and I put it out

429.61 --> 435.06
there like yeah right then you are a

433.18 --> 438.939
visceral traitor

435.06 --> 443.86
we're here in enemy grounds and you come

438.939 --> 445.87
here after I'm already there only to

443.86 --> 449.219
attack my character and how I do think

445.87 --> 449.219
in a very personal way that is

449.58 --> 455.31899999999996
that's sociopathic it's no good reason

452.65 --> 457.38899999999995
for him to do that whatsoever you know

455.319 --> 460.449
he didn't even criticize any any

457.389 --> 462.129
technical thing that I did you know when

460.449 --> 464.949
I asked him like yeah how about my

462.129 --> 467.83000000000004
everything that I put down how about my

464.949 --> 469.87
my moonlight experiment to figure out

467.83 --> 471.75899999999996
what's really going on with the

469.87 --> 483.849
temperature and he couldn't even give it

471.759 --> 485.65000000000003
back to me he did what now i dude I

483.849 --> 489.31
didn't even I didn't want to waste time

485.65 --> 492.219
with him he just came in and Jose

489.31 --> 494.59
thought I don't know why but he put him

492.219 --> 496.389
there and I was asking like yeah can we

494.59 --> 499.479
please move on to something when he just

496.389 --> 501.879
wouldn't do it and it's adventure I just

499.479 --> 505.0
had to leave because Jose was literally

501.879 --> 508.509
just letting him for no good reason

505.0 --> 510.61
attack my character like I'm kind of

508.509 --> 515.13
pissed off that house I didn't even just

510.61 --> 518.14
tell right and like dude stop it perhaps

515.13 --> 520.719
we were really talking about Flat Earth

518.14 --> 522.88
and space things and all that you know

520.719 --> 523.99
isn't that what we're supposed to be

522.88 --> 527.14
talking about right

523.99 --> 528.5790000000001
anyway misery bear no I didn't watch ken

527.14 --> 534.1
wheeler sweetie I don't watch Ken

528.579 --> 537.149
wheeler and I'd even subscribe to him so

534.1 --> 543.3100000000001
he had something about gravity again

537.149 --> 545.11
goody yeah let's reinforce the

543.31 --> 547.5
aberration some more and it's a great

545.11 --> 547.5
idea

559.9 --> 563.039
[Music]

567.17 --> 571.939
right well a gem look in Chet I'm not

569.839 --> 574.4590000000001
even gonna respond to that [ __ ] you know

571.939 --> 576.189
like ya bollock trolls and all that it's

574.459 --> 578.4799999999999
pretty disgusting in the chat

576.189 --> 581.779
especially at Jose's but yeah and

578.48 --> 584.48
debates too but but I'm not going to get

581.779 --> 585.859
triggered by that only respond to

584.48 --> 590.089
something if I can actually get

585.859 --> 592.489
something funny out of it you know but

590.089 --> 596.4390000000001
when somebody's just gonna firmly get in

592.489 --> 596.4390000000001
my way and do that that's something else

598.16 --> 601.299
[Music]

608.74 --> 614.33
evaluated flat earther food Missouri

612.5 --> 616.58
where I wouldn't even want to go there

614.33 --> 621.32
you know ken wheeler I don't trust that

616.58 --> 623.45
guy whatsoever and it's yeah you had

621.32 --> 626.5600000000001
some interesting things that he's doing

623.45 --> 631.48
and all that but he's just like his

626.56 --> 631.4799999999999
techno babbler babbles a lot

636.48 --> 641.82
so yeah of course look everything that

639.48 --> 643.98
is real that happens you can pretty much

641.82 --> 645.57
eventually come to the conclusion the

643.98 --> 648.96
earth is flat from it one way or the

645.57 --> 651.59
other because it is so yeah readouts

648.96 --> 654.24
from reality data tends to reflect

651.59 --> 656.5500000000001
reality which is that the earth is flat

654.24 --> 660.0
that doesn't mean that ken wheeler

656.55 --> 662.13
because he did that set out to find

660.0 --> 666.21
proof for the Flat Earth cuz I don't

662.13 --> 670.52
think he is a flat earther like that you

666.21 --> 670.52
know that's you seeing that in there

680.92 --> 686.4989999999999
he gave credible information of science

683.47 --> 689.529
being [ __ ] okey-dokey well if it was

686.499 --> 691.869
about the scientific method the

689.529 --> 694.449
scientific method and yeah that could be

691.869 --> 702.749
good I don't know I haven't watched that

694.449 --> 702.7489999999999
so yeah you what it is

725.78 --> 730.31
right yeah Owen Benjamin was pretty good

728.3 --> 733.67
too yesterday if I remember correctly

730.31 --> 735.29
but this yeah I had a bit of a

733.67 --> 743.7199999999999
connection issue so I couldn't really

735.29 --> 745.0999999999999
follow everything didn't yeah luckily it

743.72 --> 747.6800000000001
doesn't happen every single time

745.1 --> 757.82
extremes but it does happen a lot these

747.68 --> 759.62
days he sounded just like Bob from

757.82 --> 762.0400000000001
Globus as well that doesn't surprise me

759.62 --> 766.91
one bit because Bob from globe Buster's

762.04 --> 770.02
latches on to Ken wheeler a lot so a

766.91 --> 770.02
Boomer magic baby

781.66 --> 784.789
[Music]

790.8 --> 795.1099999999999
what kind of question is that hm

811.05 --> 817.62
any more vids with the camera coming I

813.79 --> 817.62
don't know maybe

827.73 --> 832.019
oh great well I hope misery bear could

830.249 --> 834.089
take a joke a gem because if you told

832.019 --> 836.779
something like that to me I just take it

834.089 --> 836.7790000000001
as an insult

845.53 --> 858.4
the last moon for ya there was okay are

849.28 --> 860.5899999999999
you sleeping or by the way ya sleeping

858.4 --> 862.93
were yeah well we've talked about

860.59 --> 866.8000000000001
gravity so many times just the two of us

862.93 --> 869.7099999999999
alone separately by the way and on the

866.8 --> 872.65
flat earth debates yeah it's clear what

869.71 --> 878.47
gravity is you know it's it's the effect

872.65 --> 880.15
it is the framed results comes forth

878.47 --> 884.8000000000001
from relative density disequilibrium

880.15 --> 888.52
forces so everything divides itself up

884.8 --> 891.0699999999999
and down but it's basically the name

888.52 --> 895.96
that could be given to the describe end

891.07 --> 898.84
result rather than a original factor

895.96 --> 901.84
that is as play at play causing it all

898.84 --> 903.97
and because of that smith's assumption

901.84 --> 907.47
it's a giant aberration that's really

903.97 --> 910.96
the grand core of it it really is that

907.47 --> 915.57
that perceived convenience to just

910.96 --> 920.2800000000001
assume that it is that force and that

915.57 --> 920.2800000000001
you could somehow alter that

924.91 --> 933.04
but yeah how do you you can you can't

929.44 --> 936.22
even prove that if you're gonna cause

933.04 --> 938.76
some kind of force to basically

936.22 --> 943.24
counteract the normal activities of

938.76 --> 946.72
relative density that you are countering

943.24 --> 949.96
gravity it is other forces being

946.72 --> 952.09
introduced to just like motion just

949.96 --> 955.48
motion alone you know the vomit comet is

952.09 --> 957.4300000000001
basically a neutralized relative density

955.48 --> 960.91
because of the motion because of that

957.43 --> 962.26
extra force added making the suggestion

960.91 --> 964.5699999999999
of the aberration of gravity even

962.26 --> 969.93
greater it's so easy to counteract it

964.57 --> 976.4200000000001
with just motion in a specific way but

969.93 --> 978.67
yeah you can add on or do with material

976.42 --> 980.56
which is the thing being subjected to

978.67 --> 982.39
relative density there's equilibrium you

980.56 --> 985.03
can do all these things with it that

982.39 --> 988.09
doesn't mean then that you're actually

985.03 --> 991.9499999999999
altering gravity no you're just

988.09 --> 996.37
introducing something else to it that

991.95 --> 998.88
counteracts the normal natural function

996.37 --> 998.88
see

1002.59 --> 1007.48
so if you would originally it was kind

1005.68 --> 1010.39
of suggested through science fiction as

1007.48 --> 1014.44
anti-gravity well that in itself is

1010.39 --> 1016.72
already just that's already based based

1014.44 --> 1021.4300000000001
on the base assumption that gravity is a

1016.72 --> 1024.72
thing that you can negate or yeah like a

1021.43 --> 1027.9099999999999
like a bar switch just alter like that

1024.72 --> 1030.43
which is well heavily and grinded in the

1027.91 --> 1032.77
entire heliocentric cosmogony conception

1030.43 --> 1035.89
of a distance to the earth lessening

1032.77 --> 1047.3799999999999
gravity no that well yeah there's no

1035.89 --> 1049.5700000000002
actual proof of any of that an

1047.38 --> 1055.5700000000002
acceleration is not proof of gravity

1049.57 --> 1058.0
either it is simply what happens when

1055.57 --> 1064.51
forces apply for any sort including

1058.0 --> 1067.99
relative density disequilibrium force so

1064.51 --> 1073.35
the entire gravity framework is a straw

1067.99 --> 1073.35
man in itself for the actual functions

1073.44 --> 1076.6200000000001
all right

1083.14 --> 1091.64
anyway I'm glad that I marked it as an

1085.55 --> 1094.7
aberration when I did because it's not

1091.64 --> 1098.21
just about it being fake it is also why

1094.7 --> 1103.1000000000001
I call it the aberration is because the

1098.21 --> 1106.16
structure of it enthralls the human

1103.1 --> 1110.3
consciousness to want to make it real

1106.16 --> 1112.6100000000001
and that is what makes it an aberration

1110.3 --> 1114.1699999999998
it's not just an illusion

1112.61 --> 1117.1999999999998
now it's an illusion that is very

1114.17 --> 1120.13
convenient that the mind wants to be

1117.2 --> 1120.13
make it real

1142.57 --> 1148.74
all right anyway uh gravity right so

1146.32 --> 1151.74
apparently Ken wheelers thought that he

1148.74 --> 1155.19
was doing something with gravity I guess

1151.74 --> 1155.19
what was it about

1162.0 --> 1170.71
unbalanced density what does that mean

1165.96 --> 1177.19
you mean ACH asymmetry within the

1170.71 --> 1181.6000000000001
density of an object or isn't that known

1177.19 --> 1185.71
that the denser part of the object will

1181.6 --> 1187.9599999999998
typically if left to its devices be

1185.71 --> 1190.0
displaced downwards when fall things

1187.96 --> 1195.07
fall the heavy part of it falls the

1190.0 --> 1200.23
falls at the bottom eventually be after

1195.07 --> 1202.6
the friction turbulence from the mouth

1200.23 --> 1204.94
during the motion has kind of settled

1202.6 --> 1208.48
into an equilibrium causing it to

1204.94 --> 1213.13
stabilize it's it's yeah its position

1208.48 --> 1214.81
during the fall and then the heavy part

1213.13 --> 1216.42
will be at the bottom that's how it

1214.81 --> 1219.97
works

1216.42 --> 1222.15
heavy denser the denser part of the

1219.97 --> 1222.15
object

1240.96 --> 1246.48
I really Missouri bear whose video is

1244.44 --> 1250.6100000000001
taken down now I I wouldn't know man

1246.48 --> 1253.83
like my videos don't get taken down I

1250.61 --> 1256.9799999999998
don't know why I guess that I'm at the

1253.83 --> 1260.82
either just they nobody cares or they

1256.98 --> 1264.0
think I'm crazy anyway so they're just

1260.82 --> 1265.71
leaving me to do my thing and keep it

1264.0 --> 1268.049
out of the way I don't know but yeah

1265.71 --> 1272.309
I've done plenty of like really angry

1268.049 --> 1274.86
[ __ ] and they don't care like my

1272.309 --> 1279.059
advertisement may be a little lesson but

1274.86 --> 1282.4189999999999
apparently I'm super modest compared to

1279.059 --> 1286.1689999999999
the average now or something I guess I

1282.419 --> 1292.7700000000002
can barely believe it I think I'm pretty

1286.169 --> 1295.5590000000002
outrageous at times okay I can't believe

1292.77 --> 1299.58
that I used to be like oh my god I can't

1295.559 --> 1301.86
do this because I'll do things that I'll

1299.58 --> 1306.4499999999998
regret for the rest of my life well it

1301.86 --> 1308.85
turns out to be like absolutely not this

1306.45 --> 1311.6100000000001
apparently does things that I was really

1308.85 --> 1313.1589999999999
nervous about even sharing or showing of

1311.61 --> 1316.62
myself

1313.159 --> 1321.44
turns out the world didn't feel the same

1316.62 --> 1321.4399999999998
way about it it was weird

1322.61 --> 1329.01
still takes getting used to that

1325.62 --> 1334.559
the world doesn't really see me the same

1329.01 --> 1337.4089999999999
way as I see myself and the with the

1334.559 --> 1340.799
world I mean just the average of people

1337.409 --> 1344.7890000000002
out there that actually have valid

1340.799 --> 1346.26
valuable opinions because if it's just

1344.789 --> 1350.52
trolls yeah I don't really care I know

1346.26 --> 1352.97
why they do that it's not about me there

1350.52 --> 1352.97
really is

1366.56 --> 1372.45
so-called truthers telling stories of

1369.18 --> 1373.46
you to banning as a globe spins in the

1372.45 --> 1381.47
background

1373.46 --> 1381.47
those get banned what really

1391.19 --> 1396.26
like I talked about YouTube as well you

1394.61 --> 1399.83
know I've had complaints I have

1396.26 --> 1402.2
technical complaints and worries

1399.83 --> 1405.71
sometimes I tried to take everything

1402.2 --> 1409.1000000000001
like realistic just realizing okay it is

1405.71 --> 1411.02
basically people doing that and they

1409.1 --> 1412.58
those people like everyone else are

1411.02 --> 1415.73
going to be subjected to personal

1412.58 --> 1418.25
pressures and to delusions and to

1415.73 --> 1421.19
political issues that will probably tear

1418.25 --> 1423.38
them apart and [ __ ] so I just try to get

1421.19 --> 1427.01
as most realistic approach as possible

1423.38 --> 1429.95
and realize that despite all the

1427.01 --> 1432.8
craziness most of the people at work

1429.95 --> 1436.82
probably just want it to function right

1432.8 --> 1443.75
and that's my that's how I try to keep

1436.82 --> 1446.99
my attitude and I don't know I've never

1443.75 --> 1454.96
even got is a light tap on the fingers

1446.99 --> 1458.48
for that or anything I don't know

1454.96 --> 1460.7
sometimes wandering like this what is

1458.48 --> 1463.1200000000001
good is like ban is there abandoning

1460.7 --> 1468.38
economy is that it like a shadow economy

1463.12 --> 1471.9199999999998
like hey I want to be relevant so I'm

1468.38 --> 1475.3700000000001
gonna like ask YouTube ok I'm gonna do

1471.92 --> 1477.8000000000002
this video will you ban me and then I

1475.37 --> 1484.36
can brag to my crowd that I got banned

1477.8 --> 1488.12
and sounds really ridiculous right but I

1484.36 --> 1490.9099999999999
don't know man dealing with with like

1488.12 --> 1496.37
the people out there the ballers how far

1490.91 --> 1500.96
they go like how just they don't know

1496.37 --> 1504.82
any limits in how treacherous or sneaky

1500.96 --> 1508.55
or just straight-out lying

1504.82 --> 1511.1
they have no limits in this so yeah if

1508.55 --> 1513.59
there was some kind of economy like that

1511.1 --> 1516.02
yeah maybe if I got banned then I'll be

1513.59 --> 1520.8999999999999
more relevant and maybe that just works

1516.02 --> 1523.19
statistically now so who knows who knows

1520.9 --> 1524.27
channels like that supposedly getting

1523.19 --> 1529.49
banned

1524.27 --> 1536.1
maybe it is [ __ ] I don't know man

1529.49 --> 1539.82
I'm not getting anything despite me

1536.1 --> 1542.07
saying lots of things despite me echoing

1539.82 --> 1544.5
jokes from Owen Benjamin about bike

1542.07 --> 1548.49
thieves and small hats and grab lers and

1544.5 --> 1567.3
and everything you know it doesn't seem

1548.49 --> 1571.74
to really matter but you guys think

1567.3 --> 1573.81
there's any possible legitimacy that

1571.74 --> 1575.85
there might be like a covert banning

1573.81 --> 1580.85
economy the secret deals like get me

1575.85 --> 1580.85
banned you just ask and they do it

1587.53 --> 1595.99
or is it just is it really just personal

1593.35 --> 1599.07
people abusing power that are like

1595.99 --> 1602.91
maneuvering through these reigns of the

1599.07 --> 1606.1
technology doing that [ __ ]

1602.91 --> 1608.8600000000001
because I don't know why certain people

1606.1 --> 1613.35
do get targeted like they do and I

1608.86 --> 1613.35
really don't seem to be getting targeted

1619.88 --> 1623.2890000000002
what dank

1649.97 --> 1655.54
certain people in the shadows doing it

1652.54 --> 1655.54
okay

1658.43 --> 1665.66
well I've had proof I've had dealings

1663.11 --> 1669.83
with people in shadows in my past too

1665.66 --> 1672.3400000000001
but I don't know they're not they're not

1669.83 --> 1672.34
coming back

1677.779 --> 1684.979
you know the worst I'm dealing with is

1680.119 --> 1688.58
the trolls here and even the the really

1684.979 --> 1690.979
nasty ones they I've had a couple of

1688.58 --> 1693.9189999999999
really freaky ones that they put down

1690.979 --> 1701.479
really dark [ __ ] and they don't come

1693.919 --> 1706.029
back like the worst out there is just

1701.479 --> 1710.8990000000001
these miserable baller trench dwellers

1706.029 --> 1712.879
and yeah they're just really sad and

1710.899 --> 1714.859
depressed and aggressive and that's

1712.879 --> 1719.139
really it they're not really this this

1714.859 --> 1721.749
power threat in reality no they're just

1719.139 --> 1724.7489999999998
getting in everyone's way at trolls

1721.749 --> 1724.749
right

1726.9 --> 1742.5600000000002
yeah trench dwellers they dwell in the

1732.57 --> 1744.6899999999998
trenches remember trench level it's it's

1742.56 --> 1747.51
what Nathan talks about sometimes in the

1744.69 --> 1750.27
trench level of information warfare with

1747.51 --> 1752.85
flat earth and then you have the trench

1750.27 --> 1754.77
dwellers there they are the trolls that

1752.85 --> 1756.4199999999998
don't really have a point but they

1754.77 --> 1759.09
constantly follow in everyone's

1756.42 --> 1762.8100000000002
footsteps and tries to echo it somehow

1759.09 --> 1782.03
or echo against it or those are the

1762.81 --> 1786.1499999999999
trench dwellers yeah hey Sean Hawkins

1782.03 --> 1788.6399999999999
yeah I'm probably gonna regret it but

1786.15 --> 1790.47
yeah Sean Hawkins also in over Jose's

1788.64 --> 1795.47
actually had a nice thing to say about

1790.47 --> 1795.47
me I was surprised about that

1811.72 --> 1817.1000000000001
mmm-hmm but yeah that doesn't mean of

1815.27 --> 1819.98
course there is now certainly some kind

1817.1 --> 1826.6999999999998
of different way we're gonna go about

1819.98 --> 1829.34
things concerning him but yeah yeah I

1826.7 --> 1832.49
just wanted to say thanks you like you

1829.34 --> 1836.1399999999999
technically didn't need to do that but

1832.49 --> 1839.33
yeah you felt like doing that and yeah I

1836.14 --> 1841.1000000000001
appreciate it it's almost like stepping

1839.33 --> 1845.3899999999999
out of our roles all of a sudden just

1841.1 --> 1848.1499999999999
saying like yeah that guy's okay I

1845.39 --> 1851.14
appreciate that it made me feel slightly

1848.15 --> 1851.14
different about you

1880.37 --> 1884.9899999999998
right so yeah now that you're here

1882.47 --> 1887.08
anyway Sean what did you think about

1884.99 --> 1890.15
what happened yesterday like after that

1887.08 --> 1892.4289999999999
with the right to hand because I thought

1890.15 --> 1894.3500000000001
we were gonna have an interesting

1892.429 --> 1897.23
conversation and all that and then he

1894.35 --> 1899.36
just bought it in there and started

1897.23 --> 1908.09
attacking my personality and how I do

1899.36 --> 1910.52
things and all that I like I thought it

1908.09 --> 1913.4189999999999
was a complete waste like we could have

1910.52 --> 1913.4189999999999
had a great hangout

1939.62 --> 1942.87
[Music]

1944.87 --> 1958.07
michelson-morley he owes you what he

1952.53 --> 1958.07
owes you money really how does that work

1958.16 --> 1964.49
is it about some battery that you made

1961.65 --> 1964.49
or something

1971.25 --> 1977.28
because I wouldn't make a bet with that

1974.34 --> 1978.3
guy for any reason you know I like he

1977.28 --> 1980.73
can't be trusted

1978.3 --> 1986.0
he's he's so double down on the Suhani

1980.73 --> 1991.65
attitude that he'll just break anything

1986.0 --> 1995.55
anything it's like almost Nietzschean

1991.65 --> 1999.6000000000001
like he prides himself to to be the most

1995.55 --> 2002.4099999999999
treacherous one you know terrible

1999.6 --> 2002.4099999999999
terrible attitude

2008.37 --> 2017.84
anyway enough about the right hand it

2013.5 --> 2020.79
was technically not banned in my Google

2017.84 --> 2023.04
system not like I can still see his

2020.79 --> 2027.75
comments so he's not bad like that and

2023.04 --> 2031.05
he's not in my moderation list for my

2027.75 --> 2034.41
own channel so I think I've even showed

2031.05 --> 2036.6599999999999
a couple of times that I dig dug through

2034.41 --> 2038.9
there it's just not in there so I don't

2036.66 --> 2042.21
know what the hell's going on with that

2038.9 --> 2045.38
but yeah he should definitely stop

2042.21 --> 2048.57
complaining about that ridiculous

2045.38 --> 2052.2000000000003
although on the other hand if he is just

2048.57 --> 2054.4500000000003
like banned in some higher way that we

2052.2 --> 2057.7799999999997
don't have access to anyway I kind of

2054.45 --> 2061.77
want to thank whoever did that because

2057.78 --> 2067.61
he is a pain in the ass every single

2061.77 --> 2067.61
time he pops up every single time

2074.97 --> 2086.7799999999997
Wow only [ __ ] so he actually bet you a

2079.95 --> 2086.7799999999997
hundred bucks that's just

2091.41 --> 2095.5099999999998
it's pretty special though you know that

2096.44 --> 2102.81
like just goes to show that even Sean

2100.17 --> 2104.9700000000003
Hawkins is kind of feeling like a

2102.81 --> 2109.77
halfway decent person now compared to

2104.97 --> 2112.1899999999996
this guy like he's really bad I can't

2109.77 --> 2112.19
believe it

2123.18 --> 2127.6499999999996
like I think sometimes that he thinks he

2125.76 --> 2130.23
lives in the wild wild west and it's

2127.65 --> 2137.809
just what it take whatever you can tell

2130.23 --> 2137.809
autocracy a hello enemy can right away

2150.65 --> 2156.789
he's done his rattle he's sober now what

2165.34 --> 2173.8700000000003
he dated life on rent ease Wow alright

2171.16 --> 2176.6
well I don't really watch her antes

2173.87 --> 2180.1
anymore but yeah that would be the place

2176.6 --> 2180.1
for him to do something like that

2180.82 --> 2186.7400000000002
because as it is well established thanks

2183.89 --> 2189.41
to the precedent that Randy has set

2186.74 --> 2191.5699999999997
himself doesn't really matter what is

2189.41 --> 2193.73
said anymore on this show because yeah

2191.57 --> 2196.25
you can tell you just do whatever you

2193.73 --> 2197.84
want you can just say whatever you want

2196.25 --> 2205.93
without any consequences there now

2197.84 --> 2205.9300000000003
apparently Randy started it

2218.59 --> 2225.6400000000003
all right yeah that's right random

2221.89 --> 2231.48
explorer I forgot about that yeah I did

2225.64 --> 2231.48
in the on camera I saw that that was so

2234.63 --> 2245.94
like his attitude was all cocked out

2237.94 --> 2248.35
that guy's all just talk incredible man

2245.94 --> 2251.34
but yeah thanks for reminding me I

2248.35 --> 2251.3399999999997
almost forgot about that

2256.95 --> 2262.31
a Guns of Navarone RMP or better late

2259.95 --> 2262.31
than ever

2275.75 --> 2280.75
[Music]

2277.75 --> 2280.75
what

2295.72 --> 2302.609
what are you talking about Missouri Bell

2298.15 --> 2302.609
there what

2316.5 --> 2321.29
which which troll are you talking about

2326.35 --> 2329.13
okay

2346.44 --> 2350.73
control tossing contest

2363.61 --> 2368.81
I'm getting crazy ideas in my head as

2366.68 --> 2374.35
you're saying that now I'm suddenly

2368.81 --> 2376.97
seeing just this computer game project

2374.35 --> 2378.92
where he could do like a ping-pong and

2376.97 --> 2383.27
instead of a ping pong ball you'd be

2378.92 --> 2386.81
ping pong game with a troll and every

2383.27 --> 2389.18
time you hit him he starts talking with

2386.81 --> 2390.86
a troll response like a rumpus ball or

2389.18 --> 2393.56
something every time I hit him he

2390.86 --> 2397.1600000000003
responds typically as he does it no no

2393.56 --> 2399.2
no and depending on how long his

2397.16 --> 2401.8399999999997
response is that's going to be like the

2399.2 --> 2405.4399999999996
speed of the ball going to the other

2401.84 --> 2407.63
side then you hit it again and then

2405.44 --> 2410.48
immediately another troll responds I

2407.63 --> 2414.8900000000003
don't know it's a weird imagination of

2410.48 --> 2416.95
mine dwarf-tossing yeah I've heard of

2414.89 --> 2416.95
that

2421.53 --> 2429.9300000000003
scaredy-cat scaredy-cat scaredy-cat

2426.18 --> 2429.93
scaredy-cat scaredy-cat

2459.74 --> 2465.14
yeah guns enough for an RMP I have heard

2462.5 --> 2474.849
of dwarf-tossing don't need to look that

2465.14 --> 2474.8489999999997
up make a great cartoon well

2484.5 --> 2489.84
look I'd love to be like an art director

2487.32 --> 2494.7200000000003
but as to the one technically putting

2489.84 --> 2494.7200000000003
that together I'm not good at

2521.3 --> 2527.6600000000003
Oh God Missouri bear coming Cassie Gill

2525.74 --> 2529.25
well now I thought of something else if

2527.66 --> 2534.3399999999997
you want to get really silly in this

2529.25 --> 2536.96
fashion okay then make like a typical

2534.34 --> 2539.6000000000004
old-fashioned Olympics game you know one

2536.96 --> 2543.35
of those really basic ones but on an

2539.6 --> 2547.64
autograph ik few ball planet and then do

2543.35 --> 2550.73
a dwarf tossing contest right and the

2547.64 --> 2560.35
purpose is to throw it him so hard that

2550.73 --> 2560.35
he goes into orbit how about that

2563.83 --> 2570.85
and then you have dwarf stars orbiting

2569.1 --> 2576.25
the autographic

2570.85 --> 2578.88
earth it should be really basic to do

2576.25 --> 2578.88
this in a game

2595.73 --> 2602.39
Yeah right Missouri berry you get it

2597.859 --> 2604.13
yeah what would be fun and the the funny

2602.39 --> 2607.4
thing about doing that kind of thing is

2604.13 --> 2608.15
you can take a basic setup for a game

2607.4 --> 2611.63
like that

2608.15 --> 2614.39
that's all prefab and then if you can

2611.63 --> 2618.1400000000003
just make sure you add on graphics and

2614.39 --> 2621.89
sound and some type of response system

2618.14 --> 2624.98
on top of that yeah just a little

2621.89 --> 2630.25
programming and a few adding on stuff

2624.98 --> 2633.52
and you can make a really funny yeah

2630.25 --> 2636.35
themed game out of it all of a sudden

2633.52 --> 2638.869
I've seen other people do that it should

2636.35 --> 2640.0699999999997
not be too hard if you actually know

2638.869 --> 2642.2200000000003
what you're doing with that kind of

2640.07 --> 2642.2200000000003
thing

2664.67 --> 2671.599
okay so the autographic ball planet game

2669.079 --> 2674.17
throwing Dwarfs into orbit didn't appeal

2671.599 --> 2674.17
to anyone

2689.809 --> 2692.38
yeah

2693.09 --> 2697.82
right you could call it orbital

2695.16 --> 2697.8199999999997
dwarf-tossing

2699.55 --> 2702.679
[Music]

2719.57 --> 2722.7690000000002
[Music]

2729.619 --> 2735.05
Missouri bear there's no firmament in

2732.03 --> 2735.05
the autographic view

2752.39 --> 2755.739
[Music]

2763.34 --> 2767.239
[Music]

2767.5 --> 2770.5
hmm

2781.26 --> 2785.28
that's kind of funny

2786.15 --> 2792.64
now I'm thinking about the bet yeah the

2789.78 --> 2795.0400000000004
ping-pong game again you could turn the

2792.64 --> 2799.06
ping-pong bats into Flat Earth disk

2795.04 --> 2801.73
models like printed over the bat

2799.06 --> 2804.49
animation like literally and the

2801.73 --> 2807.82
top-down model and then the ball could

2804.49 --> 2812.1899999999996
be yeah the globe earth ball being

2807.82 --> 2814.57
bounced around by the Flat Earth bats

2812.19 --> 2817.81
and every time you hit the ball there's

2814.57 --> 2822.7000000000003
a troll trying to get away from an

2817.81 --> 2825.0099999999998
argument yeah you hear a voice recording

2822.7 --> 2828.6099999999997
of one of the trolls rumbas or George or

2825.01 --> 2836.4300000000003
one of them giving some kind of weird

2828.61 --> 2838.75
response back that should be doable

2836.43 --> 2845.19
shouldn't be too difficult to get that

2838.75 --> 2848.56
all together now of course I can't do it

2845.19 --> 2852.76
because I'm completely incompetent when

2848.56 --> 2855.63
it comes to programming the actual

2852.76 --> 2855.63
technical part

2860.31 --> 2868.11
yeah $20,000 for an authentic video

2865.77 --> 2874.65
footage of ice as being assembled in

2868.11 --> 2876.8900000000003
fake space yeah afraid that's not gonna

2874.65 --> 2876.89
happen

2885.57 --> 2892.6000000000004
although I bet there's already

2888.24 --> 2895.0
animations out there of how it

2892.6 --> 2898.5099999999998
supposedly has been done I'll bet I'll

2895.0 --> 2903.09
bet you they've got that ready but it

2898.51 --> 2906.73
can be video footage they can't claim it

2903.09 --> 2908.8900000000003
they can just show you an animation that

2906.73 --> 2910.93
would be so satisfying that you would

2908.89 --> 2917.92
just be like yeah that's exactly how it

2910.93 --> 2920.8599999999997
would look like that's the best they

2917.92 --> 2925.27
could do at this point otherwise they

2920.86 --> 2927.28
would have to had pre yet to prepare for

2925.27 --> 2930.16
it before they started up the project

2927.28 --> 2932.5600000000004
and apparently they didn't there's no

2930.16 --> 2935.31
hidden footage of how the supposedly

2932.56 --> 2937.75
assemble assembly work or some kind of

2935.31 --> 2940.96
discontinued footage you know they might

2937.75 --> 2943.8
have potentially they might have thought

2940.96 --> 2946.63
like yeah we should definitely do that

2943.8 --> 2949.0600000000004
but as they were filming it for the

2946.63 --> 2953.5
eventual publication it was like like no

2949.06 --> 2955.48
this is this like this is so so bad that

2953.5 --> 2959.65
could never be present like it would

2955.48 --> 2962.71
completely ruin the careful moment so

2959.65 --> 2965.29
they just discontinued it and scrapped

2962.71 --> 2968.95
it and even from the records so who

2965.29 --> 2971.77
knows maybe there is some kind of raw

2968.95 --> 2974.46
footage that was potentially going to be

2971.77 --> 2979.11
used to show how they assembled it but

2974.46 --> 2979.11
yeah a fish aliy there definitely isn't

2996.04 --> 3006.329
can't have footage of building the

2998.26 --> 3012.4500000000003
imaginary space station they could but

3006.329 --> 3014.69
it's still gonna be trickery hey Amanda

3012.45 --> 3014.6899999999996
young

3033.77 --> 3041.15
well tiny womble the point isn't of what

3037.73 --> 3045.41
we're gonna think about it point is is

3041.15 --> 3047.48
that it's not there and there's no good

3045.41 --> 3050.72
reason for it not to be there according

3047.48 --> 3053.33
to common logical thinking right tiny

3050.72 --> 3055.64
womble you gotta agree to that they were

3053.33 --> 3060.0699999999997
building it there's no damn reason not

3055.64 --> 3064.79
to film it this is a momentous

3060.07 --> 3066.7400000000002
international event tell me about one

3064.79 --> 3070.869
event of some kind of international

3066.74 --> 3074.54
project being constructed that isn't

3070.869 --> 3078.9500000000003
yeah that's not like covertly military

3074.54 --> 3084.32
that's not widely recorded as it is

3078.95 --> 3086.1499999999996
being done there's no such thing so yeah

3084.32 --> 3089.15
there's no good reason for there not to

3086.15 --> 3092.4700000000003
be any assembly footage for the ISS it's

3089.15 --> 3092.4700000000003
just no good reason at all

3117.25 --> 3124.599
lots of footage ISS coming together

3120.94 --> 3126.839
really can anybody confirm that what

3124.599 --> 3126.839
that is

3136.69 --> 3140.819
what what is that

3147.84 --> 3154.04
what is that link you you posted their

3150.69 --> 3154.04
misery bear

3170.15 --> 3180.7400000000002
yeah it doesn't work you're literally

3176.39 --> 3188.18
linking us to your email that's not how

3180.74 --> 3191.5089999999996
that works the only thing the way you

3188.18 --> 3195.3799999999997
can web address share a picture is if

3191.509 --> 3197.569
you got the raw picture traced back to a

3195.38 --> 3200.9
website that is open for everyone to see

3197.569 --> 3206.2889999999998
not a specific source of a program that

3200.9 --> 3206.289
only you can interface with okay

[Music]

3250.9 --> 3262.39
Scott faeo okay Scott I'm Scott Fitch he

3259.3 --> 3263.53
has a video of ISS being built in space

3262.39 --> 3265.54
well that's great

3263.53 --> 3268.9
somebody could link me up to that video

3265.54 --> 3273.37
I'll study it it it probably was already

3268.9 --> 3275.77
dealt with for years because I know I'm

3273.37 --> 3278.23
not typically the person that's gonna be

3275.77 --> 3281.59
like oh what's the latest space footage

3278.23 --> 3284.8
so that I can show everybody how fake it

3281.59 --> 3286.4500000000003
is no I might have noticed I'm not that

3284.8 --> 3289.69
person at all

3286.45 --> 3295.6299999999997
no I'm rather a person that's kind of

3289.69 --> 3298.2400000000002
looking at it and just feeling like like

3295.63 --> 3300.06
I wish they weren't nefarious I wish

3298.24 --> 3307.0299999999997
they just put out a good dream and

3300.06 --> 3309.25
weren't up to all this dark stuff that's

3307.03 --> 3315.13
really my response I don't even yeah I'm

3309.25 --> 3322.42
more sad that I'm like excited to get to

3315.13 --> 3326.07
attack them or anything yeah but that

3322.42 --> 3328.54
the religious double Downers however oh

3326.07 --> 3331.02
yeah that that's a matter that's a

3328.54 --> 3331.02
different matter

3345.08 --> 3350.7799999999997
right well dank am Scott Fitch yeah he

3349.07 --> 3353.57
might have hit pieces on everyone

3350.78 --> 3356.7400000000002
whatever that means but he's supposedly

3353.57 --> 3361.1200000000003
the son of an astronaut by his own claim

3356.74 --> 3364.75
his debts told him he went to space and

3361.12 --> 3371.24
he's holding on to that with his life

3364.75 --> 3373.46
and I don't know look if somebody has

3371.24 --> 3376.39
this video of the supposed to Diocese

3373.46 --> 3378.83
assembly I'd love to take a look at it

3376.39 --> 3382.93
because I don't think there was any I

3378.83 --> 3382.93
don't remember there being any

3402.83 --> 3406.33
Oh what's that neck

3417.78 --> 3420.77
okay

3428.53 --> 3431.13
yeah

3443.48 --> 3447.98
right well flicking through that yeah

3446.36 --> 3456.58
that's great

3447.98 --> 3459.29
whoo dear God fisheye lens warping I

3456.58 --> 3462.61
don't know I'm not seeing any assembly

3459.29 --> 3462.61
here of the ISS

3487.31 --> 3490.09
hmm

3516.94 --> 3523.65
yeah okay now take it easy

3539.81 --> 3545.02
giant heads in the background what ALJ

3565.31 --> 3568.449
[Music]

3570.04 --> 3580.39
yeah tiny one well this is not a

3572.56 --> 3581.65
political war okay everybody has people

3580.39 --> 3585.04
in their family

3581.65 --> 3588.42
that'll believe the globe it's not gonna

3585.04 --> 3591.94
be a single exception I can't imagine it

3588.42 --> 3596.5
because you somebody in the family

3591.94 --> 3598.18
despite all the a brings all the the

3596.5 --> 3601.9
good raising is the good lessons they

3598.18 --> 3606.19
will be like polled fascinated to the

3601.9 --> 3607.9300000000003
other side to find a ego opposition to

3606.19 --> 3609.48
everyone else I was kind of like that in

3607.93 --> 3613.5099999999998
my own way

3609.48 --> 3616.2400000000002
so yeah Dell doesn't matter some people

3613.51 --> 3620.0200000000004
will just grab ahold of that globe and

3616.24 --> 3623.16
they're just too curious that doesn't

3620.02 --> 3626.05
make them the enemy it just makes them

3623.16 --> 3629.0499999999997
spellbound they have to go through the

3626.05 --> 3634.69
steps they have to take that challenge

3629.05 --> 3637.9500000000003
and see how long we'll take for them to

3634.69 --> 3637.9500000000003
let it go again

3646.37 --> 3650.6
well tiny one will you political you're

3649.52 --> 3652.52
talking about hate

3650.6 --> 3655.1
why would somebody have to hate their

3652.52 --> 3656.75
family because they believe in the globe

3655.1 --> 3660.62
when they're a flat earther that don't

3656.75 --> 3662.78
be ridiculous that's not how it works we

3660.62 --> 3665.7999999999997
don't hate ballers we just hate the

3662.78 --> 3669.2000000000003
freakin lying piece of [ __ ] trolls that

3665.8 --> 3671.42
are constantly just avoiding answering

3669.2 --> 3673.49
questions in tough subjects that's the

3671.42 --> 3674.33
one we can those are the people we can't

3673.49 --> 3676.8799999999997
stand okay

3674.33 --> 3680.5699999999997
not just ballers it's not a politics

3676.88 --> 3682.4
type of situation because most people

3680.57 --> 3684.77
are ballers so what why would you

3682.4 --> 3686.87
suggest that somebody would hate their

3684.77 --> 3691.18
family for believing in the ball or

3686.87 --> 3691.18
whatever that's ridiculous

3695.08 --> 3700.4
anyway I'm gonna round out the show so

3698.45 --> 3702.8599999999997
