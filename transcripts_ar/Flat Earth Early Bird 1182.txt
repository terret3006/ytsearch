very much needed

92.64 --> 94.96
right

96.4 --> 102.159
well today is

99.36 --> 105.36
yeah it's a bit hazy

102.159 --> 108.24000000000001
a bit cloudy still some

105.36 --> 109.84
sun in between there but

108.24 --> 112.399
it's a

109.84 --> 114.56
bit of a hazy soup and yeah it does seem

112.399 --> 115.6
like it's

114.56 --> 118.88
plain

115.6 --> 118.88
trail caused

119.759 --> 122.56
but yeah it's still kind of nice and

121.439 --> 124.079
sunny and

122.56 --> 128.119
temperature is

124.079 --> 128.119
decently warm outside

130.879 --> 133.2
right

133.28 --> 137.44
so even with all the haze it

135.36 --> 140.08
it doesn't really seem to suppress the

137.44 --> 142.0
temperature that much

140.08 --> 144.4
anyway yeah there's a lot less wind

142.0 --> 144.4

373.759 --> 379.639
i didn't watch it

375.28 --> 379.63899999999995
it was just yeah not

380.639 --> 384.40000000000003
not really focused at the time

384.88 --> 389.36
and brian does get very technical always

387.039 --> 392.36
with this video so but yeah i did notice

389.36 --> 392.36
it

415.039 --> 418.52
all right come on

428.24 --> 431.88
hey adam price

440.88 --> 443.12
right

444.639 --> 448.16
so yeah i don't know if i'm going to be

446.16 --> 451.199
as

448.16 --> 452.56
fluid as it was yesterday

451.199 --> 455.68
got some

452.56 --> 457.68
weird issue with my jaw

455.68 --> 460.08
like i think like during eating i might

457.68 --> 460.08
have like

460.4 --> 467.35999999999996
bitten down kind of wrong on something

463.759 --> 467.36
it's kind of sore now

471.28 --> 476.479
which is kind of distracting but yeah

473.52 --> 479.479
other than that i'm doing fine

476.479 --> 479.479
uh

496.8 --> 499.52000000000004
hey crockett

504.24 --> 507.24
what

507.28 --> 513.4789999999999
a man came to your job looking exactly

509.84 --> 513.4789999999999
like me really

524.24 --> 526.48
hmm

530.56 --> 535.1999999999999
well i don't know what i'm going to be

532.0 --> 537.04
doing in 20 years

535.2 --> 539.2
maybe i'll be time traveling to visit

537.04 --> 539.1999999999999
you

541.12 --> 545.04
nah

543.36 --> 547.279
yeah i don't

545.04 --> 550.48
i don't really notice a lot of people

547.279 --> 550.48
out there that look like me

556.959 --> 562.5189999999999
maybe my doppelganger

559.519 --> 562.519
the

563.36 --> 568.08
except not really because he seems 20

565.44 --> 568.08
years older

573.12 --> 576.72
darwin is a time travel he doesn't know

575.04 --> 577.76
it yet

576.72 --> 580.0
really

577.76 --> 582.64
now i kind of do know it i just don't

580.0 --> 585.2
know if i'm going to yeah at some point

582.64 --> 587.68
somehow break the barriers and like

585.2 --> 590.6800000000001
actually physically displace myself in

587.68 --> 590.68
time

591.2 --> 597.9200000000001
i mean

593.2 --> 597.9200000000001
that was weirdly a part of the visions

598.32 --> 600.8000000000001
really

600.08 --> 601.6
but

600.8 --> 603.76
yeah

601.6 --> 606.5600000000001
that could have very easily just been

603.76 --> 608.079
there just to distract me

606.56 --> 610.399
there were a lot of things that i was

608.079 --> 612.7199999999999
being preoccupied with during that

610.399 --> 615.04
entire giant process

612.72 --> 618.0400000000001
a lot of which are like absolutely not

615.04 --> 618.04
real

621.44 --> 625.12
and like time

623.2 --> 626.8000000000001
things were also part of that it was

625.12 --> 630.519
really weird

626.8 --> 630.519
but yeah this

634.56 --> 638.959
let's just say it was somebody that kind

636.64 --> 641.1999999999999
of looked like me it's much more likely

638.959 --> 643.8389999999999
i mean there's a lot of people here in

641.2 --> 643.839
this realm

645.36 --> 649.76
everybody has look-alikes everybody

657.76 --> 660.76
huh

671.279 --> 675.8389999999999
anybody seen guns have never run around

678.48 --> 683.76
he said he would support me

680.56 --> 686.64
on friday but i haven't noticed anything

683.76 --> 688.72
could really use that because i am like

686.64 --> 690.88
again

688.72 --> 692.88
getting very close to broke and i still

690.88 --> 695.04
need to get through the rest of the

692.88 --> 697.6
month

695.04 --> 700.8389999999999
which is like at least another one and a

697.6 --> 700.839
half week

708.16 --> 711.76
right

709.279 --> 713.04
yeah do you think that if i'd be like a

711.76 --> 715.92
time traveler

713.04 --> 717.76
that at least i'd be able to like give

715.92 --> 719.4399999999999
myself money from the future or

717.76 --> 720.639
something

719.44 --> 724.6800000000001
but

720.639 --> 724.6800000000001
no of course not

730.639 --> 735.519
i was getting your surgery hmm

733.519 --> 736.88
right okay in that case he must have

735.519 --> 740.04
forgotten i hope everything went well

736.88 --> 740.04
with that

748.16 --> 751.8
hello len lenox

775.11 --> 778.159
[Music]

778.39 --> 786.1899999999999
[Applause]

810.16 --> 812.48
right

813.04 --> 818.399
so yeah i've been playing this game for

816.16 --> 821.6
a while now what is it a little over a

818.399 --> 823.68
week hey borders boy

821.6 --> 826.639
off world trading company and i think i

823.68 --> 826.6389999999999
really mastered it

826.959 --> 831.5999999999999
and it's it took me quite a while

830.72 --> 832.639
because

831.6 --> 835.0400000000001
like

832.639 --> 837.04
you really have to have like very tight

835.04 --> 838.8
focus on certain things and you have to

837.04 --> 840.56
figure out what those things are you

838.8 --> 844.24
need to focus on every time you have to

840.56 --> 847.279
size up like the entire scene

844.24 --> 850.16
and then like figure out what is

847.279 --> 852.32
what are the players

850.16 --> 854.16
which are ai players like

852.32 --> 856.32
on player character

854.16 --> 859.04
competition like what will they

856.32 --> 861.44
naturally do and like what would i do

859.04 --> 863.8389999999999
because there it is a marketing type

861.44 --> 866.1600000000001
based game

863.839 --> 868.32
but i think i got the hang of it quicker

866.16 --> 870.16
than i thought i would like when i

868.32 --> 872.24
started playing that i really expected

870.16 --> 874.0
that i was gonna get sick of it and just

872.24 --> 875.92
like ugh

874.0 --> 877.839
i'm not doing that again but it turns

875.92 --> 882.079
out that

877.839 --> 885.9200000000001
i'm pretty i'm getting decent at it

882.079 --> 890.399
like even upping the difficulty level

885.92 --> 892.7199999999999
a little back to more neutral

890.399 --> 892.72
right

894.48 --> 900.639
and it is kind of a good game to play in

896.88 --> 900.639
the background while listening to

900.72 --> 906.48
yeah shows like fed

904.16 --> 910.16
premieres or like alex jones in the

906.48 --> 910.16
background works really well for that

910.839 --> 917.1990000000001
right maybe i'll join elijah some point

914.399 --> 919.839
and actually play that

917.199 --> 921.3599999999999
with something in the background

919.839 --> 924.6
like fed

921.36 --> 924.6
who knows

930.72 --> 935.72
hey nathan oakley 9080 good to see you

941.839 --> 944.839
um

959.68 --> 963.7589999999999
i'm not a member though what

964.0 --> 968.56
now this is not a members only chat

966.16 --> 972.0
linda looks this is a subscribers only

968.56 --> 972.0
chat it's a new option that's

972.16 --> 976.0
in the editor

974.079 --> 978.959
that i had noticed before and it worked

976.0 --> 978.959
really well so far

980.56 --> 984.88
it is certainly

982.399 --> 987.12
turning out to be a relatively effective

984.88 --> 990.24
troll deterrent

987.12 --> 990.24
at least so far

993.759 --> 997.839
yeah yeah man oh yesterday's live show

997.04 --> 1000.3199999999999
had

997.839 --> 1002.8000000000001
so many live views that was pretty

1000.32 --> 1005.6
impressive

1002.8 --> 1005.5999999999999
over 200

1007.44 --> 1011.519
but yeah there was a lot of energy in

1009.199 --> 1013.519
the air yesterday overall like

1011.519 --> 1014.639
all streams

1013.519 --> 1017.04
right

1014.639 --> 1021.199
you you guys might think

1017.04 --> 1024.48
it seems a bit silly but like i pay

1021.199 --> 1026.3999999999999
attention right a lot to like the energy

1024.48 --> 1029.039
in there i literally name it i call it

1026.4 --> 1031.52
energy in there it's like oh wow today i

1029.039 --> 1033.679
feel really focused this that's why i

1031.52 --> 1035.52
always address this on my show every

1033.679 --> 1036.5590000000002
time it's like hey what kind of a day is

1035.52 --> 1038.559
this

1036.559 --> 1040.3999999999999
you know why

1038.559 --> 1042.559
because

1040.4 --> 1045.919
it has an influence

1042.559 --> 1048.3999999999999
not what i'm doing or that i am doing it

1045.919 --> 1051.8400000000001
it's just that it seems that the energy

1048.4 --> 1053.2
that just arrived in the day

1051.84 --> 1054.8799999999999
widely

1053.2 --> 1057.52
the same

1054.88 --> 1057.5200000000002
for people

1058.48 --> 1062.4
it's interesting

1059.919 --> 1064.7990000000002
it's it's like what's in the spiritual

1062.4 --> 1067.1200000000001
feeding trough today what did god give

1064.799 --> 1068.48
us available what do we have available

1067.12 --> 1070.6399999999999
today

1068.48 --> 1072.64
it's spirit-wise so it's not like the

1070.64 --> 1074.96
physical food necessary

1072.64 --> 1076.72
and it comes and goes with the days and

1074.96 --> 1078.32
it seems to like

1076.72 --> 1082.32
resonate

1078.32 --> 1084.6399999999999
very far so for example i follow still

1082.32 --> 1086.72
follow like the alex jones show

1084.64 --> 1088.88
a lot and like the other shows around

1086.72 --> 1088.88
that

1089.12 --> 1093.4399999999998
like when it's not too too fair poorly

1092.0 --> 1095.2
annoying

1093.44 --> 1096.24
not too alarmist

1095.2 --> 1097.919
because there's still a lot of

1096.24 --> 1100.48
interesting stuff but i'm just noticing

1097.919 --> 1101.76
that if i have a very good

1100.48 --> 1104.559
energy day

1101.76 --> 1106.799
fed usually has a good energy day and

1104.559 --> 1110.08
then when i tune in to

1106.799 --> 1113.52
infowars then the the show hosts there

1110.08 --> 1116.799
are having the same type of energy day

1113.52 --> 1118.72
right and then when i'm like weakened

1116.799 --> 1120.84
then i notice that

1118.72 --> 1124.24
the same thing well they're not

1120.84 --> 1127.6
like retreating but they then start

1124.24 --> 1131.36
applying different strategies

1127.6 --> 1133.28
in how they do the show

1131.36 --> 1136.08
like if i'm having a bit of a weakened

1133.28 --> 1140.3999999999999
energy day it they tend to like play

1136.08 --> 1140.3999999999999
more into gamma and savage

1140.88 --> 1145.8400000000001
so they're feeling it too it's not just

1143.679 --> 1147.76
me here

1145.84 --> 1151.28
when i feel like oh it's this kind of a

1147.76 --> 1153.44
day no that actually reflects widely

1151.28 --> 1157.12
on people

1153.44 --> 1159.039
and people in media and they adapt to it

1157.12 --> 1161.039
if they're well if they're

1159.039 --> 1163.039
serious

1161.039 --> 1164.96
and i've just noticed that

1163.039 --> 1167.12
it's like oh i'm having this kind of day

1164.96 --> 1169.919
oh fed is having that kind of day like

1167.12 --> 1172.8799999999999
oh look yeah this that and that

1169.919 --> 1174.72
all these media people all having those

1172.88 --> 1177.1200000000001
types of days

1174.72 --> 1179.28
and it reflects on like how they're

1177.12 --> 1180.4799999999998
composing themselves on their live

1179.28 --> 1183.12
streams

1180.48 --> 1186.08
and just really noticing that that it's

1183.12 --> 1186.08
pretty synchronous

1186.32 --> 1189.28
and that's interesting

1191.12 --> 1195.12
to me

1192.64 --> 1196.5590000000002
i have the senses for it

1195.12 --> 1198.32
so i'm like

1196.559 --> 1201.36
finding this

1198.32 --> 1201.36
thing that's happening

1201.6 --> 1206.84
and just trying to figure out like what

1203.679 --> 1206.8400000000001
it means

1207.039 --> 1212.4
and then also it kind of does help

1210.4 --> 1214.4
give you a little bit of an edge in

1212.4 --> 1216.3200000000002
being able to predict how people are

1214.4 --> 1218.0
going to respond depending on what kind

1216.32 --> 1220.32
of energy is in the air

1218.0 --> 1222.08
oh this kind of energy okay that means

1220.32 --> 1225.2
if i'm gonna bump into somebody it's

1222.08 --> 1227.4399999999998
very likely they're gonna have

1225.2 --> 1231.52
this array of responses because it's

1227.44 --> 1231.52
more likely they'll have that energy too

1233.679 --> 1239.52
right so it's really comes down to oh

1235.679 --> 1241.76
it's this kind of a day it's a day for

1239.52 --> 1246.0
opportunities it's a day for

1241.76 --> 1248.1589999999999
for getting contact it's a day to

1246.0 --> 1249.2
like start a new project with a bunch of

1248.159 --> 1251.44
people

1249.2 --> 1252.96
or like oh it's this is a shitty day

1251.44 --> 1255.3600000000001
it's a day where everybody's gonna be

1252.96 --> 1258.88
like distracted and then yes you better

1255.36 --> 1262.0
not try to do like start a new plan in

1258.88 --> 1264.24
such a day

1262.0 --> 1265.919
right

1264.24 --> 1268.0
so

1265.919 --> 1270.0800000000002
what kind of energy

1268.0 --> 1272.64
god brings for the day

1270.08 --> 1277.039
this spiritual feeding trough that we

1272.64 --> 1279.679
are all presented with matters a lot

1277.039 --> 1282.4
for what you can do in that day

1279.679 --> 1282.4
and it's

1282.799 --> 1288.559
it's debatable how predictable it even

1285.2 --> 1290.64
is right i think that astrologers

1288.559 --> 1293.76
have been widely utilized even in the

1290.64 --> 1296.3200000000002
past to try to be able to predict that

1293.76 --> 1299.12
when a good energy day is coming right

1296.32 --> 1301.36
it almost seems like a lot of like

1299.12 --> 1301.36
more

1301.84 --> 1307.9189999999999
standardized astrologers tip yeah more

1305.28 --> 1310.72
mainstream type astrologers

1307.919 --> 1313.3600000000001
that that's what they kind of want to

1310.72 --> 1315.44
make you believe that they can help you

1313.36 --> 1317.1999999999998
with the point that oh this is going to

1315.44 --> 1318.559
be a good day

1317.2 --> 1320.159
this is going to be a day where you can

1318.559 --> 1322.72
finally do that

1320.159 --> 1325.679
or oh you have to be careful right

1322.72 --> 1329.6000000000001
that's what they try to aim at

1325.679 --> 1333.1200000000001
but can they act does astrology actually

1329.6 --> 1336.799
accurately predict exactly

1333.12 --> 1339.039
what type of spirit food god is gonna

1336.799 --> 1340.48
put in the spirit feeding trough for the

1339.039 --> 1343.2
day

1340.48 --> 1346.48
does astrology actually predict that

1343.2 --> 1349.28
accurately now that's a big question

1346.48 --> 1351.44
right it's not like oh they're trying to

1349.28 --> 1353.84
play you they're they're witches oh

1351.44 --> 1356.0800000000002
they're trying to fool you no

1353.84 --> 1357.6789999999999
do they actually have that knowledge

1356.08 --> 1359.039
through astrology

1357.679 --> 1361.039
or

1359.039 --> 1363.6
have they learned a couple of things

1361.039 --> 1366.559
within astrology like for example this

1363.6 --> 1367.9189999999999
moon cycle and its influence

1366.559 --> 1371.76
right

1367.919 --> 1375.6000000000001
that also add a bit to it

1371.76 --> 1379.039
but not that main feeding chunk that we

1375.6 --> 1381.12
all just wake up with every day because

1379.039 --> 1383.6
it's like they know about what could

1381.12 --> 1386.1589999999999
color that like oh it's a full moon and

1383.6 --> 1389.039
more likely that people will be riled up

1386.159 --> 1391.2800000000002
and we're looking for conflict

1389.039 --> 1393.2
pms or something right

1391.28 --> 1394.32
but

1393.2 --> 1396.64
still

1394.32 --> 1398.799
that yeah that has a big influence when

1396.64 --> 1399.76
that happens when it's a day like that

1398.799 --> 1402.799
but

1399.76 --> 1406.1589999999999
still the other

1402.799 --> 1409.6
factor seems more random

1406.159 --> 1411.919
it's like i haven't seen an astrologer

1409.6 --> 1414.6399999999999
like perfectly back engineer through

1411.919 --> 1416.48
astrology exactly like oh

1414.64 --> 1418.3200000000002
remember that day was this kind of

1416.48 --> 1420.0
energy days exactly because of these

1418.32 --> 1420.799
constellations the next day was like

1420.0 --> 1423.279
this

1420.799 --> 1426.24
lower energy or like oh four days in a

1423.279 --> 1428.64
row building up and then a sudden halt

1426.24 --> 1430.559
through australia i've never seen

1428.64 --> 1432.96
any astrologer

1430.559 --> 1434.32
like really back engineer like how

1432.96 --> 1436.159
things go

1434.32 --> 1438.3999999999999
and the energy that we get presented

1436.159 --> 1440.24
with by god in our spiritual feeding

1438.4 --> 1442.64
trough in the day

1440.24 --> 1446.799
through astrology

1442.64 --> 1448.88
it seems separated to me

1446.799 --> 1452.1589999999999
this is what i'm paying attention to

1448.88 --> 1452.159
right this is all super

1453.2 --> 1456.96
mechanical this is all about the spirit

1455.279 --> 1459.12
mechanics like

1456.96 --> 1461.1200000000001
because it happens right it happens we

1459.12 --> 1463.4399999999998
wake up and suddenly it's like oh it's a

1461.12 --> 1464.559
different day it's very different i feel

1463.44 --> 1467.52
different

1464.559 --> 1469.36
i slept different i am more calm

1467.52 --> 1472.24
i feel more focused have more senses

1469.36 --> 1474.9599999999998
available to me and

1472.24 --> 1478.08
i'm not so burdened by the

1474.96 --> 1479.1200000000001
the bad news ideas

1478.08 --> 1481.6789999999999
right

1479.12 --> 1483.84
well what determines

1481.679 --> 1486.0800000000002
that it is going to be a day like that

1483.84 --> 1487.6789999999999
and that everybody seems to have that

1486.08 --> 1488.799
response

1487.679 --> 1491.44
right

1488.799 --> 1493.76
that's my question is that related to

1491.44 --> 1497.279
astrology exactly is that perfectly back

1493.76 --> 1499.76
engineerable through astrology or is it

1497.279 --> 1502.96
really like a unique

1499.76 --> 1503.84
influence that the designer just it's

1502.96 --> 1506.159
like

1503.84 --> 1508.72
this is gonna be it and you can't

1506.159 --> 1508.72
predict it

1510.08 --> 1513.84
right these are some of the things that

1512.0 --> 1516.64
little old

1513.84 --> 1516.6399999999999
ponders upon

1516.72 --> 1522.24
right falls under spirit mechanics

1518.799 --> 1524.559
because yeah what where else is it

1522.24 --> 1526.159
it is a spirit mechanic right we wake up

1524.559 --> 1527.6
and suddenly there's a lot of energy

1526.159 --> 1529.8400000000001
available

1527.6 --> 1531.4399999999998
right even though the day before

1529.84 --> 1534.72
might have been relatively the same

1531.44 --> 1536.96
weather and then everybody was like oh

1534.72 --> 1538.24
distracted i got a headache or something

1536.96 --> 1539.8400000000001
and then the next day it's just as

1538.24 --> 1542.08
beautiful weather and suddenly it's like

1539.84 --> 1544.0
oh we're all released and everybody's

1542.08 --> 1547.6
like oh we're free

1544.0 --> 1547.6
what determines

1548.32 --> 1551.12
that effect

1551.44 --> 1554.96
at this point my only

1555.279 --> 1559.12
the only the the keystone for that that

1557.919 --> 1562.0
i can

1559.12 --> 1564.1589999999999
deduce is that it's literally the

1562.0 --> 1566.24
creator that determines that

1564.159 --> 1568.88
again because i don't know

1566.24 --> 1570.4
any astrologer that can perfectly back

1568.88 --> 1572.3200000000002
engineer

1570.4 --> 1575.8400000000001
how this energy

1572.32 --> 1578.24
of the day influence works perfectly

1575.84 --> 1579.36
even though they there's a lot of

1578.24 --> 1581.2
ads

1579.36 --> 1583.76
for astrologers

1581.2 --> 1587.279
that kind of suggest that they do have

1583.76 --> 1588.8799999999999
that prediction capability

1587.279 --> 1592.679
so what do you guys think about that

1588.88 --> 1592.679
train of thought of mine

1610.559 --> 1614.24
i think this is why the ancients were

1612.159 --> 1617.8400000000001
upset ancients not just the ancients all

1614.24 --> 1619.039
the rich people all have astrologers

1617.84 --> 1622.24
right

1619.039 --> 1624.8799999999999
and it's logical because astrologers

1622.24 --> 1626.88
know about

1624.88 --> 1628.48
like

1626.88 --> 1631.1200000000001
tanable

1628.48 --> 1632.88
spiritual influences through

1631.12 --> 1634.559
things like the moon cycle right

1632.88 --> 1635.679
constellations

1634.559 --> 1637.76
like

1635.679 --> 1638.5590000000002
the astral astrological influence of

1637.76 --> 1641.76
that

1638.559 --> 1642.799
and yeah as a giant

1641.76 --> 1645.039
money

1642.799 --> 1647.76
and influence wielding

1645.039 --> 1650.1589999999999
figure you need to have every little

1647.76 --> 1651.76
edge you need to

1650.159 --> 1654.7990000000002
plan out

1651.76 --> 1656.08
complex unroll plans with like thousands

1654.799 --> 1658.0
of people

1656.08 --> 1660.0
when they're all exactly in the right

1658.0 --> 1662.24
mood for to be able to do that

1660.0 --> 1665.44
efficiently so you need astrology to get

1662.24 --> 1665.44
every little edge right

1667.2 --> 1669.8400000000001
it makes sense

1671.44 --> 1674.48
but

1672.64 --> 1677.679
again

1674.48 --> 1680.799
can astrologers actually perfectly back

1677.679 --> 1682.799
engineer exactly how things are going

1680.799 --> 1685.679
how how they went

1682.799 --> 1687.76
influence-wise energy influence-wise

1685.679 --> 1690.3200000000002
to the degree where they can literally

1687.76 --> 1692.1589999999999
predict like this is the the schedule

1690.32 --> 1694.1589999999999
for the next two weeks

1692.159 --> 1695.8400000000001
it's going to be halfway energy day then

1694.159 --> 1698.159
it's going to slow down slow down oh and

1695.84 --> 1699.52
then a sudden jump and then it's going

1698.159 --> 1701.1200000000001
to stay that high and then it's going to

1699.52 --> 1703.76
go down slowly

1701.12 --> 1708.2399999999998
and then up like can they actually

1703.76 --> 1711.84
perfectly predict how that cycle works

1708.24 --> 1711.84
i don't think so

1713.76 --> 1718.8799999999999
like not based on like things that they

1716.24 --> 1720.799
can actually point out exactly how they

1718.88 --> 1723.679
determine that they might have like a

1720.799 --> 1726.48
perfect visionary intuition moment

1723.679 --> 1728.64
right where they like just envision like

1726.48 --> 1729.44
this is coming i can see it

1728.64 --> 1732.24
right

1729.44 --> 1734.0800000000002
but those things are not like oh

1732.24 --> 1736.799
i see it coming

1734.08 --> 1738.559
here's exactly how i technically worked

1736.799 --> 1741.039
out how that works through the moon

1738.559 --> 1742.32
influence then and the plan is there

1741.039 --> 1743.919
see

1742.32 --> 1747.279
that part

1743.919 --> 1747.279
you don't get to see that

1747.52 --> 1750.559
so it's separate

1750.72 --> 1756.48
the influence of the astrology

1754.08 --> 1758.559
is kind of separate

1756.48 --> 1761.2
what that's what i think i can't prove

1758.559 --> 1763.6789999999999
it but i strongly have this sense that

1761.2 --> 1766.0800000000002
this is the case

1763.679 --> 1768.48
astrology influence are separate from

1766.08 --> 1771.6789999999999
what god basically

1768.48 --> 1773.84
scoops up for the day

1771.679 --> 1776.3990000000001
and presents for everybody

1773.84 --> 1776.399
to wield

1778.08 --> 1780.399
right

1779.52 --> 1782.6399999999999
this is why

1780.399 --> 1784.08
mega corporations etc are big rich

1782.64 --> 1786.24
people that have a large organization

1784.08 --> 1787.76
they always have to have like fallback

1786.24 --> 1789.6
plans always

1787.76 --> 1792.24
because you can't perfectly predict it

1789.6 --> 1794.8799999999999
you can try to aim it at the right

1792.24 --> 1797.679
moment the right time of the month

1794.88 --> 1799.44
to get the best chances that it'll work

1797.679 --> 1801.76
fluid right because they'll save money

1799.44 --> 1803.039
but there's always chance that it's not

1801.76 --> 1805.279
exactly going to work something

1803.039 --> 1807.2
unexpected happened that the astrologers

1805.279 --> 1809.52
didn't predict and some people are gonna

1807.2 --> 1811.919
be reporting in sick and then suddenly

1809.52 --> 1812.8799999999999
it slows down you're gonna have profit

1811.919 --> 1816.24
loss

1812.88 --> 1816.24
right that's how it works

1818.48 --> 1822.0
yeah

1820.559 --> 1823.9189999999999
i guess it's really showing that i've

1822.0 --> 1826.64
been playing that game because just

1823.919 --> 1830.0
really getting into like

1826.64 --> 1830.0
what it is like to like

1831.919 --> 1835.679
have the reins over

1833.679 --> 1837.52
an organization even if it's just

1835.679 --> 1840.52
virtual in a game

1837.52 --> 1840.52
right

1862.88 --> 1867.0390000000002
uh borders boy

1864.48 --> 1868.159
that's weird thing to say you think they

1867.039 --> 1870.72
can

1868.159 --> 1873.7600000000002
it is knowledge we have turned away from

1870.72 --> 1875.279
in favor oh really what no hey if you're

1873.76 --> 1878.32
gonna say turn away

1875.279 --> 1881.039
what knowledge

1878.32 --> 1881.039
what is it then

1883.84 --> 1886.24
i mean

1887.36 --> 1891.6789999999999
just the suggestion

1889.76 --> 1893.76
that they do have that power and that

1891.679 --> 1896.64
they're keeping it for from us right

1893.76 --> 1898.559
secret technology type of idea

1896.64 --> 1900.96
that gives them

1898.559 --> 1904.32
power and influence

1900.96 --> 1904.32
if people believe that

1905.279 --> 1910.88
why why give it to them unless you have

1907.6 --> 1910.8799999999999
palpable proof of it

1912.399 --> 1917.84
that they do have that knowledge

1914.72 --> 1920.0
and the oh we lost it really like the

1917.84 --> 1922.32
moon landing technology oh we used to

1920.0 --> 1923.679
have it we just lost it

1922.32 --> 1925.6
or

1923.679 --> 1928.159
they never had it

1925.6 --> 1930.48
and it's just a ploy to make everybody

1928.159 --> 1932.88
believe they had it

1930.48 --> 1938.76
so that you dream

1932.88 --> 1938.7600000000002
with hopes or frustrations towards them

1943.49 --> 1946.559
[Music]

1959.44 --> 1963.0800000000002
hey geo shifter

1988.88 --> 1994.3990000000001
right okay uh borders yeah it might i'm

1992.159 --> 1995.7600000000002
not sure if you're addressing what i was

1994.399 --> 1997.76
talking about

1995.76 --> 1999.84
the spiritual feeding trough that god

1997.76 --> 2001.76
presents for us in day

1999.84 --> 2004.399
or the astrological influence because

2001.76 --> 2006.799
the astrological influences

2004.399 --> 2009.5189999999998
by the wider dumb public have certainly

2006.799 --> 2009.519
been ignored

2011.039 --> 2013.679
it's like a

2013.76 --> 2020.24
western society atheist kind of thing

2016.32 --> 2020.24
it's like oh no it's all nonsense

2024.96 --> 2029.1200000000001
right

2026.159 --> 2032.24
but to suggest that there is like a

2029.12 --> 2034.559
perfect mechanism to

2032.24 --> 2037.2
give us oversight into

2034.559 --> 2040.48
how much energy like what type of day

2037.2 --> 2040.48
it's going to be exactly

2042.159 --> 2046.7990000000002
it's kind of pointless to just believe

2044.559 --> 2050.0
that that knowledge is there

2046.799 --> 2051.599
if you have no lead for it other than

2050.0 --> 2054.56
somebody that might be claiming they

2051.599 --> 2057.8790000000004
have it and they're not telling it right

2054.56 --> 2057.879
that's pointless

2063.04 --> 2067.679
believe we have lost our abilities

2066.24 --> 2071.56
no

2067.679 --> 2071.56
we just lose the knowledge

2074.96 --> 2078.96
right you perish for a lack of knowledge

2077.44 --> 2081.44
famous

2078.96 --> 2083.919
biblical saying was it even jesus that

2081.44 --> 2085.52
said it himself could be

2083.919 --> 2087.2
people perish for a lack of knowledge

2085.52 --> 2090.8
it's true

2087.2 --> 2094.0
right we don't lose the abilities unless

2090.8 --> 2096.079
you like kind of sacrifice them because

2094.0 --> 2096.079
of

2097.28 --> 2103.6800000000003
your greed or something right because

2099.28 --> 2106.2400000000002
you on purpose denounce an ability

2103.68 --> 2108.3999999999996
in favor of something else

2106.24 --> 2111.52
you don't just lose the ability you lose

2108.4 --> 2113.52
the knowledge of it

2111.52 --> 2117.32
right you have to be you have to figure

2113.52 --> 2117.32
out how to do it

2119.52 --> 2125.119
you don't literally lose those abilities

2122.88 --> 2125.119
like

2127.2 --> 2133.2
like let's just say

2129.839 --> 2137.119
a bit of an astrologer witchy type

2133.2 --> 2139.68
mother somewhere in a family and then

2137.119 --> 2141.6800000000003
like her kids are like for some reason

2139.68 --> 2143.9199999999996
like super atheist right they're like

2141.68 --> 2145.68
really they don't like a store they just

2143.92 --> 2148.16
think their mother's crazy

2145.68 --> 2151.5989999999997
and then they have a family

2148.16 --> 2151.5989999999997
hopefully they're not all gay

2151.68 --> 2155.9199999999996
and then

2153.119 --> 2158.4
like those kids might be like yeah

2155.92 --> 2160.56
atheism hell yeah

2158.4 --> 2161.92
you know it works perfectly for them

2160.56 --> 2163.839
they're maybe

2161.92 --> 2166.4
maybe not so maybe they'll corrupt like

2163.839 --> 2168.24
they become political or something right

2166.4 --> 2170.56
but let's see then

2168.24 --> 2174.0
at some point one of them might still

2170.56 --> 2177.2
have kids well

2174.0 --> 2179.04
that kid third generation might just

2177.2 --> 2181.2
suddenly

2179.04 --> 2181.2
be

2181.599 --> 2185.599
a natural witch type

2183.52 --> 2189.44
and they will be like

2185.599 --> 2192.0
really offended by the entire

2189.44 --> 2194.48
direction the family culture has been

2192.0 --> 2196.64
taking at a very young age detect that

2194.48 --> 2200.32
and be like no i'm actually gonna do the

2196.64 --> 2202.4
astrology thing again

2200.32 --> 2203.6800000000003
right

2202.4 --> 2206.64
like my

2203.68 --> 2206.64
great grandma

2206.8 --> 2210.4
oh look at that i found an old journal

2208.64 --> 2212.0
from my great grandma man i'm going to

2210.4 --> 2214.2400000000002
look into this right and then they'll

2212.0 --> 2216.32
just have that ability again they don't

2214.24 --> 2217.839
lose it just because two generations

2216.32 --> 2221.44
don't use it

2217.839 --> 2222.88
it's still there it's still internal

2221.44 --> 2225.44
it's that just

2222.88 --> 2227.28
the people don't use it

2225.44 --> 2229.839
they ignore it

2227.28 --> 2232.48
in favor of something else

2229.839 --> 2234.32
the ability gen just remains dormant you

2232.48 --> 2235.28
don't lose it

2234.32 --> 2237.2000000000003
by not

2235.28 --> 2239.3590000000004
using it like

2237.2 --> 2241.359
i mean as an individual

2239.359 --> 2243.2799999999997
if you don't train something or if you

2241.359 --> 2245.04
lay something down in favor of something

2243.28 --> 2247.52
else then you

2245.04 --> 2249.2
will erode in the quality of that

2247.52 --> 2250.96
ability right

2249.2 --> 2253.68
that doesn't mean that the

2250.96 --> 2256.16
the seed of the ability

2253.68 --> 2257.5989999999997
goes out of your out of your genetics

2256.16 --> 2259.52
out of your bloodline it's not like the

2257.599 --> 2261.44
ability is literally genetically

2259.52 --> 2264.16
extracted from you by god if you don't

2261.44 --> 2267.44
use it it just remains dormant the

2264.16 --> 2271.839
ability the talent will still be there

2267.44 --> 2271.839
in the next generations you see

2280.88 --> 2285.839
do i think knowledge has been suppressed

2283.52 --> 2285.839
yeah

2286.88 --> 2290.32
people suppress knowledge

2293.04 --> 2297.599
usually because they can't handle it or

2294.96 --> 2299.359
they don't want to handle it

2297.599 --> 2301.52
and they think that they can get away

2299.359 --> 2303.7599999999998
with it because everybody else is doing

2301.52 --> 2303.7599999999998
that

2308.96 --> 2315.359
why do you think most scientists

2311.119 --> 2315.359
now don't believe in astrology

2315.839 --> 2320.24
because it's probably because of

2317.839 --> 2324.24
political reasons because it's such a

2320.24 --> 2324.24
blatant contrast with their

2324.839 --> 2329.359
astronomical heliocentric space science

2327.92 --> 2333.359
fiction

2329.359 --> 2335.5989999999997
right astrology makes no sense

2333.359 --> 2337.04
the suggestions of astrology make no

2335.599 --> 2340.4
sense

2337.04 --> 2341.7599999999998
in the heliocentric model universe

2340.4 --> 2343.6800000000003
right

2341.76 --> 2344.5600000000004
it literally doesn't make sense it's

2343.68 --> 2345.839
just like

2344.56 --> 2348.64
[Music]

2345.839 --> 2352.56
to them because like no

2348.64 --> 2355.2799999999997
these are big fat bodies of dirt

2352.56 --> 2357.68
at extreme distances away that just

2355.28 --> 2359.92
happened to be in a certain cycle how

2357.68 --> 2362.24
could that have an influence on the

2359.92 --> 2364.64
energy on earth right it makes no sense

2362.24 --> 2368.0
from that perspective

2364.64 --> 2371.92
so of course they're ignoring astrology

2368.0 --> 2374.32
it conflicts with their model sci-fi

2371.92 --> 2374.32
dream

2380.4 --> 2384.2400000000002
because they rely on funding

2383.359 --> 2386.56
uh

2384.24 --> 2388.8799999999997
no because it conflicts they can't

2386.56 --> 2390.72
officially just like put it right next

2388.88 --> 2392.48
to astronomy

2390.72 --> 2394.0789999999997
because it doesn't

2392.48 --> 2397.72
fit

2394.079 --> 2397.7200000000003
doesn't fit together

2399.04 --> 2402.48
logically

2400.48 --> 2404.72
right i mean you could still be like oh

2402.48 --> 2407.119
i still believe in astrology and i'm

2404.72 --> 2409.52
like oh yeah i like spirits and [ __ ]

2407.119 --> 2411.76
right but you can't that has to be

2409.52 --> 2413.52
personal then you can't just say oh yeah

2411.76 --> 2417.6800000000003
i am going to justify this in a

2413.52 --> 2420.24
scientific way no that that doesn't work

2417.68 --> 2425.0789999999997
the scientific way right

2420.24 --> 2425.0789999999997
heliocentric scientific way

2440.64 --> 2446.16
no i wasn't gonna read the name matthew

2442.8 --> 2448.5600000000004
i don't read troll if it i only i rarely

2446.16 --> 2453.3999999999996
read the names of

2448.56 --> 2453.4
people that could potentially be trolls

2460.48 --> 2463.359
and by the way what makes you say he's a

2462.319 --> 2467.839
troll

2463.359 --> 2467.839
i mean that was a pretty decent question

2478.24 --> 2483.04
even though it is a zero subscriber

2480.64 --> 2483.04
account

2487.2 --> 2491.72
all right mfpo have fun with that

2546.88 --> 2551.839
okay well yeah borders boy yeah of

2549.599 --> 2551.839
course

2554.48 --> 2558.079
book burnings

2555.92 --> 2562.359
it does happen

2558.079 --> 2562.3590000000004
but the thing is is that

2565.599 --> 2569.44
nothing that's really valuable is truly

2568.24 --> 2572.3999999999996
lost

2569.44 --> 2577.44
when it comes to knowledge

2572.4 --> 2577.44
because people will figure it out again

2577.599 --> 2582.079
i have kind of a theory about that which

2580.079 --> 2585.2000000000003
is very

2582.079 --> 2585.2000000000003
it's not scientific

2586.319 --> 2590.4
that

2587.28 --> 2592.48
technically once some a person somewhere

2590.4 --> 2593.839
in time has discovered something and

2592.48 --> 2597.28
wrote it out

2593.839 --> 2599.52
had put that idea that that idea

2597.28 --> 2602.1600000000003
is basically

2599.52 --> 2605.28
in the akashic library forever it's

2602.16 --> 2607.52
manifested once and that means

2605.28 --> 2611.3590000000004
that after that point somebody can

2607.52 --> 2613.28
literally just click bump into it easier

2611.359 --> 2615.68
than if it weren't

2613.28 --> 2617.76
already discovered you see

2615.68 --> 2619.2799999999997
it doesn't have to be written down to be

2617.76 --> 2621.599
rediscovered

2619.28 --> 2623.52
it's it's like it's related to the

2621.599 --> 2626.0
hundred monkey

2623.52 --> 2627.44
effect the popular

2626.0 --> 2631.28
idea

2627.44 --> 2633.52
that if you just like if monkeys

2631.28 --> 2635.599
learn a trick on an island

2633.52 --> 2637.28
in a group that's certainly on the other

2635.599 --> 2639.3590000000004
side of the world

2637.28 --> 2642.0
they will simultaneously figure out the

2639.359 --> 2643.92
same trick right it's kind of based

2642.0 --> 2644.88
adjacent to that idea i think that's

2643.92 --> 2647.2000000000003
real

2644.88 --> 2649.6800000000003
so it's not like oh this precious

2647.2 --> 2652.0789999999997
knowledge is like no no

2649.68 --> 2653.839
if it was really precious

2652.079 --> 2657.119
even if it is destroyed it will be

2653.839 --> 2657.119
figured out quicker

2659.359 --> 2664.0
it will just be rediscovered

2661.68 --> 2666.319
and it will probably be quicker

2664.0 --> 2670.0
because the idea the idea if it was

2666.319 --> 2673.04
really that precious has manifested once

2670.0 --> 2673.04
and then it stays

2673.52 --> 2679.04
it's a permanent addition to the akashic

2675.76 --> 2681.2000000000003
library whether whether people

2679.04 --> 2684.319
forget about it or not

2681.2 --> 2686.8799999999997
right they will be able to re-stumble

2684.319 --> 2690.44
upon it

2686.88 --> 2690.44
purely internally

2706.8 --> 2711.599
astrology reading no i'm not in

2708.88 --> 2713.52
astrology rufus ain't hobbins

2711.599 --> 2717.6400000000003
i'm not an astrologer

2713.52 --> 2717.64
right just like i'm not a programmer

2731.839 --> 2735.359
all right glenn linox have fun

2736.24 --> 2742.1189999999997
richard dawkins morphic resin what

2746.079 --> 2748.5600000000004
okay

2752.48 --> 2756.88
i'm not particularly familiar with

2754.88 --> 2759.76
richard dawkins

2756.88 --> 2761.44
intellectual legacy

2759.76 --> 2764.0
maybe he's

2761.44 --> 2766.96
he had the same idea right i think that

2764.0 --> 2770.56
richard dawkins is mostly full of [ __ ]

2766.96 --> 2773.04
if i'm if i can trust jim bob on that

2770.56 --> 2775.839
since he is like his prominent

2773.04 --> 2775.839
evolutionist

2776.079 --> 2780.4
right

2777.52 --> 2782.88
but if he came up with that concept then

2780.4 --> 2784.7200000000003
i'm like yeah

2782.88 --> 2787.52
that's a good idea right

2784.72 --> 2791.64
like even the worst of propagandists can

2787.52 --> 2791.64
have a great idea sometimes

2816.48 --> 2820.56
rupert shell drake theory

2821.68 --> 2825.5989999999997
okay

2823.839 --> 2827.44
look that up

2825.599 --> 2831.2400000000002
don't remember

2827.44 --> 2831.2400000000002
bumped into that name

2838.56 --> 2841.56
hmm

2844.079 --> 2847.3590000000004
oh man that guy's old

2854.16 --> 2859.04
wait is he really that old damn

2857.44 --> 2861.92
it's looking pretty good or that's an

2859.04 --> 2861.92
older photograph

2870.16 --> 2873.16
right

2880.24 --> 2882.64
right

2883.04 --> 2887.5589999999997
a researcher in the field of

2884.559 --> 2887.559
parapsychology

2890.4 --> 2895.44
no it's pseudoscience oh

2892.72 --> 2895.4399999999996
yeah fine

2895.68 --> 2899.5589999999997
that's what you want to think

2902.16 --> 2907.16
but it isn't science technically so yeah

2916.8 --> 2920.6800000000003
is my chat stuck

2932.48 --> 2937.839
didn't egyptians believe in a river of

2934.559 --> 2940.3190000000004
knowledge that could be tapped into

2937.839 --> 2942.7999999999997
i'm not specifically aware about what

2940.319 --> 2945.52
the the supposed ancient egyptians

2942.8 --> 2949.92
believed or didn't believe

2945.52 --> 2949.92
but it could be they were very esoteric

2951.2 --> 2956.5589999999997
like i technically don't even know what

2953.2 --> 2959.68
like where the akashic record

2956.559 --> 2961.8390000000004
idea came from

2959.68 --> 2963.68
i don't know

2961.839 --> 2965.44
i just know that as soon as i learned

2963.68 --> 2968.839
about it was like yeah that makes

2965.44 --> 2968.839
perfect sense

2991.119 --> 2994.119
do

3011.359 --> 3015.52
shown it in nature all over the place

3018.559 --> 3023.52
even how crystals grow oh wow that's

3020.8 --> 3025.6800000000003
fascinating really

3023.52 --> 3029.4
that is very interesting rig back i

3025.68 --> 3029.3999999999996
didn't know that part

3032.24 --> 3035.24
hmm

3048.4 --> 3050.64
hmm

3051.44 --> 3056.16
right yeah elise g

3054.24 --> 3058.9599999999996
as though the sky is an

3056.16 --> 3063.2799999999997
allegorical holographic

3058.96 --> 3065.359
projection of the collective conscious

3063.28 --> 3068.44
all history and thought on display in

3065.359 --> 3068.44
the moment

3068.88 --> 3076.6800000000003
i don't know if that's literal but it

3071.44 --> 3076.68
does kind of have a feel like that to it

3086.4 --> 3094.0
i mean it's not strange how you would

3089.68 --> 3094.0
draw such a conclusion based on

3094.72 --> 3100.359
yeah on like how astrology even works

3152.88 --> 3155.88
so

3176.8 --> 3179.8
hmm

3188.88 --> 3192.52
oh look at that

3198.559 --> 3202.0400000000004
that looks beautiful

3217.599 --> 3221.6400000000003
the moon is still up there

3288.4 --> 3291.4
hmm

3339.04 --> 3344.04
ah sorry guys i'm a little distracted

3341.04 --> 3344.04
here

3364.0 --> 3369.68
what am i doing

3366.72 --> 3373.0
yeah i'm just it's hurting a little

3369.68 --> 3373.0
kind of annoying

3422.72 --> 3426.64
right but yeah borders void makes sense

3431.119 --> 3433.839
all right

3452.24 --> 3454.64
right

3457.839 --> 3463.2799999999997
yes you can think edward bernay for that

3460.799 --> 3463.28
a lot

3463.68 --> 3468.799
it was really like the

3466.319 --> 3472.0
something that came with the

3468.799 --> 3475.839
atomic family as well

3472.0 --> 3475.839
is like to kind of

3478.72 --> 3484.799
yeah

3480.319 --> 3484.799
to cast off like a long lineage

3486.319 --> 3489.839
family tradition

3491.2 --> 3494.8799999999997
right because that's not part of the

3492.88 --> 3496.7200000000003
atomic family it's like you can be

3494.88 --> 3498.48
whatever family

3496.72 --> 3499.52
and you just

3498.48 --> 3503.839
go with

3499.52 --> 3503.839
society that's really part of that

3504.72 --> 3510.319
atomic family is not typically

3507.04 --> 3510.319
traditionalist you see

3514.24 --> 3519.7599999999998
i mean it is in the face of where we're

3518.0 --> 3521.76
at now

3519.76 --> 3525.0400000000004
it is right

3521.76 --> 3526.88
but in the face of

3525.04 --> 3529.04
what it used to be

3526.88 --> 3532.1600000000003
like real family traditions where you

3529.04 --> 3534.079
would have like records

3532.16 --> 3535.44
of your great grandfathers and all that

3534.079 --> 3539.76
right

3535.44 --> 3539.76
that's not incorporated in that system

3540.0 --> 3543.799
it's not part of that

3571.839 --> 3573.92
you

3587.44 --> 3590.44
uh

3618.319 --> 3621.319
hmm

3637.52 --> 3640.52
uh

3654.319 --> 3657.319
hmm

3658.319 --> 3661.319
so

3693.92 --> 3699.92
right okay uh you guys seem to be having

3696.96 --> 3704.2
a great conversation among one another

3699.92 --> 3704.2000000000003
i'll just take a two minute break

3744.799 --> 3747.799
so

3809.44 --> 3814.88
massive worldwide mudblood yeah but did

3811.76 --> 3817.5200000000004
the mud flood actually kill

3814.88 --> 3821.48
those masses of people did it jeff guy

3817.52 --> 3821.48
said where's the proof of that

3829.68 --> 3834.48
i mean where are all the

3831.599 --> 3836.96
the bodies still buried in that in those

3834.48 --> 3838.72
old layers of mud or the mass graves

3836.96 --> 3842.0
when they were all

3838.72 --> 3842.0
dug up right

3846.4 --> 3852.1600000000003
like how do you know that the mud flood

3849.839 --> 3855.0389999999998
killed a lot of people really where's

3852.16 --> 3857.2799999999997
where's even the leads for that

3855.039 --> 3859.6800000000003
where's the lead

3857.28 --> 3862.2400000000002
like where are all the graves like the

3859.68 --> 3865.24
mass graves for that specific

3862.24 --> 3865.24
moment

3873.52 --> 3876.52
do

3885.68 --> 3888.0789999999997
jeff

3889.44 --> 3893.119
it's kind of a

3890.799 --> 3895.92
random

3893.119 --> 3897.6800000000003
assertion there to say that oh there

3895.92 --> 3899.2000000000003
were so many people and then the mud

3897.68 --> 3902.64
flood happened and they all died oh

3899.2 --> 3904.96
really where's the mass graves

3902.64 --> 3908.16
for the mud flooded

3904.96 --> 3910.7200000000003
dead people

3908.16 --> 3910.72
where are they

3911.359 --> 3915.319
have you thought about that

3931.04 --> 3934.199
[Music]

3940.64 --> 3943.64
so

3958.96 --> 3965.2400000000002
massive birds yeah but those were not

3961.039 --> 3965.2400000000002
freaking mud flood victims

3976.559 --> 3981.3590000000004
right oh by the way

3979.119 --> 3981.359
uh

3982.24 --> 3986.9599999999996
i've seen some of like those supposed

3985.28 --> 3988.799
bone

3986.96 --> 3991.76
catacombs

3988.799 --> 3995.68
and they're fake they're actually

3991.76 --> 3995.6800000000003
like fake cast bones

3996.88 --> 4001.359
buried house yeah but where's where's

3999.28 --> 4003.92
all the mass graves where's the mass

4001.359 --> 4006.799
graves jess jeff gassett i'm i'm a

4003.92 --> 4009.039
little annoyed here because you just

4006.799 --> 4012.48
laid that link there like there's some

4009.039 --> 4014.4
supposed evidence there is none

4012.48 --> 4016.96
there's no evidence that anybody got

4014.4 --> 4018.0
killed in these mud floods

4016.96 --> 4019.119
right

4018.0 --> 4021.839
i mean

4019.119 --> 4025.039
even like wars from

4021.839 --> 4027.2799999999997
200 300 years ago

4025.039 --> 4029.6800000000003
there would be like war

4027.28 --> 4031.52
graves and memorials

4029.68 --> 4033.1189999999997
all that time ago

4031.52 --> 4036.88
so they'd made

4033.119 --> 4040.2400000000002
graves and even memorials for that

4036.88 --> 4042.48
but not for like a massive

4040.24 --> 4044.3999999999996
worldwide

4042.48 --> 4046.96
disaster

4044.4 --> 4048.4
where massive amounts they just they

4046.96 --> 4051.359
don't mention that

4048.4 --> 4053.52
it's just like oh it's just gone

4051.359 --> 4057.92
bones in paris are not fake yeah some of

4053.52 --> 4061.48
them are gadge inspector yes they are

4057.92 --> 4061.48
yes they are

4066.799 --> 4072.64
no graves you're right so yeah so then

4070.64 --> 4074.4
you must conclude

4072.64 --> 4076.24
based on the evidence and the lack

4074.4 --> 4078.559
thereof

4076.24 --> 4083.0389999999998
that whatever the mud flood was it

4078.559 --> 4083.039
didn't kill a giant amount of people

4086.16 --> 4090.52
because there would be evidence for that

4108.64 --> 4112.6
okay so you can store water

4131.679 --> 4136.4800000000005
or we speak i don't know jeff gas had

4133.92 --> 4136.4800000000005
brought it up

4138.799 --> 4143.2789999999995
like i am not too i'm not a hundred

4141.359 --> 4147.08
percent sure about this supposed mud

4143.279 --> 4147.080000000001
flood at all

4153.92 --> 4158.2390000000005
i mean things may have happened there

4156.0 --> 4160.4
may have been some weird liquefaction

4158.239 --> 4162.3189999999995
event or something right mud flood

4160.4 --> 4164.799
though

4162.319 --> 4166.719
like the way

4164.799 --> 4168.719
for example martin luther suggests like

4166.719 --> 4171.44
literally a flood of whatever i don't

4168.719 --> 4173.679
know i don't think so and if it did then

4171.44 --> 4176.0
it would have not been worldwide it

4173.679 --> 4180.6
would have been local

4176.0 --> 4180.6
in multiple places perhaps

4199.52 --> 4204.159000000001
the empty cities in the orphan trade

4202.239 --> 4206.4
yeah but

4204.159 --> 4208.719
where are the graves then seeking star

4206.4 --> 4208.719
water

4209.199 --> 4215.159
so the orphans that's cool

4211.76 --> 4215.159000000001
where are the graves

4247.04 --> 4250.56
and like

4248.0 --> 4251.84
besides like how does that even work a

4250.56 --> 4253.6
train

4251.84 --> 4255.92
full of orphans

4253.6 --> 4259.6
like huge amounts

4255.92 --> 4262.4800000000005
so how did they survive

4259.6 --> 4266.400000000001
but all the parents didn't

4262.48 --> 4266.4
how does any of this make sense

4266.88 --> 4273.4800000000005
relating to a mudflood

4269.199 --> 4273.48
it doesn't make sense to me

4293.04 --> 4296.04
do

4300.8 --> 4304.8
maybe the rules of kingdom evacuate yeah

4303.199 --> 4309.32
that's cool

4304.8 --> 4309.320000000001
where are the graves

4314.239 --> 4317.44
i mean

4315.28 --> 4319.5199999999995
as far as i know it's like oh when

4317.44 --> 4323.28
people get killed in like a

4319.52 --> 4325.679
mud flood or whatever pyroclastic flow

4323.28 --> 4328.639999999999
you know the thing is that

4325.679 --> 4332.2390000000005
there's dead bodies that remain behind

4328.64 --> 4332.2390000000005
they don't just boom

4332.88 --> 4337.92
vanish into thin air it's just oh

4335.199 --> 4337.919999999999
they're just gone

4341.92 --> 4344.8
that doesn't happen

4346.08 --> 4349.44
where is the mass graves

4350.48 --> 4355.5199999999995
or if they couldn't dig it up

4353.52 --> 4357.52
where are the

4355.52 --> 4359.84
petrified mud

4357.52 --> 4362.96
flood sites

4359.84 --> 4365.1990000000005
where people are pretty certain like all

4362.96 --> 4367.52
those dead bodies are like in the middle

4365.199 --> 4367.5199999999995
of it

4367.92 --> 4370.32
right

4369.04 --> 4371.84
because they're like still stuck in the

4370.32 --> 4374.0
mud they couldn't dig it out because it

4371.84 --> 4376.4800000000005
petrified again or something i get it

4374.0 --> 4378.719
they're not just gonna like

4376.48 --> 4380.799999999999
like literally dig them out of the rock

4378.719 --> 4382.88
right that's kind of weird they would

4380.8 --> 4386.0
have probably left them well that means

4382.88 --> 4388.719
that there is like a rock face somewhere

4386.0 --> 4392.56
with like people corpses like a lot of

4388.719 --> 4394.08
them in the middle of it right

4392.56 --> 4398.04
where

4394.08 --> 4398.04
where are the corpses

4402.159 --> 4407.12
i'm kind of astonished you guys all like

4405.12 --> 4409.28
oh what blood oh they died like why

4407.12 --> 4411.199
haven't you thought about this

4409.28 --> 4413.759999999999
where are the corpses where are the mass

4411.199 --> 4418.599999999999
graves where where are they i haven't

4413.76 --> 4418.6
had a single answer from any of you

4430.76 --> 4433.9490000000005
[Music]

4436.56 --> 4444.0
civil war famine right well random look

4440.239 --> 4446.32
if it were civil war famine graves

4444.0 --> 4449.52
guess what

4446.32 --> 4450.48
yeah you can actually have a

4449.52 --> 4452.88
pretty

4450.48 --> 4456.48
pretty detailed investigation or

4452.88 --> 4458.400000000001
archaeol archaeological investigation

4456.48 --> 4459.919999999999
dig up these graves and then see oh

4458.4 --> 4461.04
famine

4459.92 --> 4464.32
oh

4461.04 --> 4465.679
a war oh really oh so where are the war

4464.32 --> 4469.599999999999
wounds

4465.679 --> 4471.84
where are the the famine like the proofs

4469.6 --> 4473.52
that they were basically self-digesting

4471.84 --> 4476.56
right which is really what happens with

4473.52 --> 4479.6
the terrible death-causing famine

4476.56 --> 4482.400000000001
there's all this proof that will remain

4479.6 --> 4484.64
in the corpses of what happened they all

4482.4 --> 4486.639999999999
died in a war they will have holes in

4484.64 --> 4490.159000000001
them they will have shattered bones they

4486.64 --> 4492.88
will have holes in skulls etc etc

4490.159 --> 4495.199
proof of the wounds that they died from

4492.88 --> 4495.1990000000005
right

4495.36 --> 4497.92
if they were

4496.64 --> 4501.04
famine death

4497.92 --> 4503.04
there will be like these things that you

4501.04 --> 4504.32
could just see on the bones like oh that

4503.04 --> 4506.32
person

4504.32 --> 4507.92
basically starved to death

4506.32 --> 4510.96
literally i know about i don't know

4507.92 --> 4513.04
exactly how just paid attention i know

4510.96 --> 4514.64
that that's the case you can investigate

4513.04 --> 4516.719
and prove like yeah

4514.64 --> 4519.76
these people died of famine

4516.719 --> 4521.92
these people died of war wounds

4519.76 --> 4521.92
so

4522.64 --> 4528.2390000000005
has there been an investigation

4525.04 --> 4529.5199999999995
if it was actually real or were they all

4528.239 --> 4531.839999999999
drowned

4529.52 --> 4534.56
did they all drown

4531.84 --> 4536.159000000001
or like get crushed

4534.56 --> 4539.6
through what you would expect if they

4536.159 --> 4542.599999999999
died in a mud flood

4539.6 --> 4542.6
right

4554.8 --> 4560.159000000001
no one can date what you're not allowed

4558.64 --> 4562.320000000001
serious

4560.159 --> 4566.199
indian group what the hell does indian

4562.32 --> 4566.199
graves have to do with it

4566.4 --> 4568.719
what

4571.44 --> 4574.44
what

4589.92 --> 4595.4400000000005
oh

4591.6 --> 4597.280000000001
cool random i didn't know that

4595.44 --> 4601.159
so you did actually do a study that's

4597.28 --> 4601.159
interesting that's cool

4628.64 --> 4633.679
have you ever like

4630.48 --> 4635.5199999999995
made an official case with that random

4633.679 --> 4637.12
ever like

4635.52 --> 4639.52
actually

4637.12 --> 4640.719
they did excavations

4639.52 --> 4643.76
and then

4640.719 --> 4645.76
well did the the forensic studies

4643.76 --> 4648.2390000000005
on corpses like to determine like yeah

4645.76 --> 4649.76
this person died of a

4648.239 --> 4653.08
famine or

4649.76 --> 4653.08
or war

4666.08 --> 4671.199
what

4667.199 --> 4674.719
so are you saying they're actually

4671.199 --> 4676.719
basically classifying graves by calling

4674.719 --> 4679.199
them indian even though indians had

4676.719 --> 4681.199
absolutely nothing to do with it

4679.199 --> 4686.879999999999
that is such a

4681.199 --> 4686.879999999999
gross gross fraud that's so evil

4688.56 --> 4690.8
like

4690.88 --> 4694.8
that's

4693.6 --> 4697.4400000000005
like

4694.8 --> 4700.0
if i was a native american i would be so

4697.44 --> 4702.32
insulted

4700.0 --> 4705.679
that like the government would literally

4702.32 --> 4708.5599999999995
forbid just classify graves by calling

4705.679 --> 4712.56
them indian even though they aren't

4708.56 --> 4716.88
that's a grave in the grave insult

4712.56 --> 4719.4400000000005
literally that's a grave insult like why

4716.88 --> 4721.92
aren't native americans

4719.44 --> 4726.799999999999
fighting against that like how dare you

4721.92 --> 4726.8
call that site indian graves they aren't

4727.84 --> 4730.84
why

4742.8 --> 4749.12
hmm okay brandon that's fascinating i

4745.52 --> 4751.360000000001
would i would kind of like to hear

4749.12 --> 4753.599999999999
or like to see you do a report about

4751.36 --> 4756.639999999999
that sometime

4753.6 --> 4759.92
where you actually detail what you did

4756.64 --> 4763.12
that and testify that you did actually

4759.92 --> 4765.6
dig up one of these sites and its study

4763.12 --> 4767.04
and your findings that would be really

4765.6 --> 4768.8
interesting and i think that a lot of

4767.04 --> 4770.8
the mud flutters

4768.8 --> 4772.719
would also be very interested to hear

4770.8 --> 4776.1990000000005
your your testimony

4772.719 --> 4776.199
about that brandon

4816.159 --> 4820.32
what

4817.36 --> 4822.88
underwater what the hell are you talking

4820.32 --> 4822.88
about get

4824.08 --> 4827.08
no

4833.76 --> 4836.8
you're not serious gadget inspect come

4835.84 --> 4839.1990000000005
on

4836.8 --> 4841.6
you're not seriously suggesting like the

4839.199 --> 4847.32
worldwide mudflood was caused by

4841.6 --> 4847.320000000001
underwater volcanoes that's ridiculous

4851.04 --> 4856.639
well you think some volcanoes are just

4853.44 --> 4856.638999999999
gonna spew mud

4857.12 --> 4860.679
that what

4885.679 --> 4889.84
yeah why not because it makes no damn

4887.679 --> 4889.84
sense

4897.28 --> 4903.12
that that falls like seriously

4899.92 --> 4904.88
underground volcano caused the mud flood

4903.12 --> 4907.28
right i think it's more likely that

4904.88 --> 4909.84
there was like a massive spontaneous

4907.28 --> 4913.04
diarrhea worldwide and that that caused

4909.84 --> 4914.88
the bot flood i think that that's a more

4913.04 --> 4918.159
sensible

4914.88 --> 4920.639
cause for the mud flood than underground

4918.159 --> 4923.638999999999
like underwater volcanoes is absolutely

4920.639 --> 4923.639
ridiculous

4937.44 --> 4941.199
yeah there's no such thing as a mud

4939.52 --> 4945.120000000001
volcano

4941.199 --> 4948.239
i mean there are mud pits

4945.12 --> 4951.36
but those are kind of more like geysers

4948.239 --> 4951.36
it's not a volcano

4955.52 --> 4962.719
and they don't like

4957.36 --> 4962.719
pump out astronomical amounts of mud

4963.92 --> 4966.8
makes no sense

4967.6 --> 4971.6
it's much more likely to have been some

4969.6 --> 4972.639
kind of a liquefaction event which would

4971.6 --> 4976.2390000000005
be

4972.639 --> 4976.2390000000005
sound vibration based

4979.199 --> 4987.839999999999
that that could cause like a

4982.56 --> 4987.84
yeah a much more decentralized event

4989.12 --> 4993.76
than just one

4990.88 --> 4995.28
physical thing somewhere spouting out a

4993.76 --> 4996.159000000001
bunch of mud

4995.28 --> 5000.44
which

4996.159 --> 5000.44
yeah that doesn't work at all

5009.199 --> 5013.5199999999995
liquefaction find some rocks get some

5011.28 --> 5019.159
raw wish

5013.52 --> 5019.159000000001
yeah liquefaction is really scary

5068.4 --> 5071.638999999999
hey kevlar

5079.52 --> 5082.56
yeah well with the real liquefaction

5081.52 --> 5084.719
it's

5082.56 --> 5086.0
when it's really serious not just some

5084.719 --> 5088.08
local

5086.0 --> 5091.12
minor liquefact it's really you got a

5088.08 --> 5094.5599999999995
problem in one way or the other

5091.12 --> 5094.5599999999995
because like the only thing that

5094.639 --> 5099.84
only safe spot would be like a giant

5097.6 --> 5101.84
giant solid

5099.84 --> 5103.52
piece of rock

5101.84 --> 5106.639
like a really

5103.52 --> 5109.52
stable mountain right

5106.639 --> 5111.52
because if it's just a really large

5109.52 --> 5113.360000000001
bowler somewhere

5111.52 --> 5115.679
then you might be like oh that's that's

5113.36 --> 5117.759999999999
a safe spot well guess what

5115.679 --> 5120.96
it might just roll

5117.76 --> 5123.84
slide right into the mud right

5120.96 --> 5127.04
yeah it has to really be like

5123.84 --> 5129.4400000000005
a rock that's footed into the solid

5127.04 --> 5130.88
rock foundation

5129.44 --> 5134.4
because rocks

5130.88 --> 5137.04
can just be kind of lying around on dirt

5134.4 --> 5139.04
and those will just slide and sink and

5137.04 --> 5140.639
roll over

5139.04 --> 5142.8
not very safe

5140.639 --> 5144.8
even if they're really big

5142.8 --> 5146.320000000001
so you really got to kind of find a

5144.8 --> 5150.28
mountain

5146.32 --> 5150.28
a really stable mountain

5158.96 --> 5163.4890000000005
so

5160.3 --> 5163.4890000000005
[Music]

5178.0 --> 5183.719
huh okay kevlar no problem that sounds

5180.719 --> 5183.719
great

5198.159 --> 5202.4
my reason what came from no they didn't

5203.199 --> 5211.799999999999
no it wasn't much from the a flood

5206.88 --> 5211.8
that's not how that works at all gadget

5217.199 --> 5224.04
if it's literally mud that's created

5219.36 --> 5224.04
like in a flood then

5224.56 --> 5231.4400000000005
yeah that's gonna literally like

5227.44 --> 5231.44
completely rearrange the landscape

5231.76 --> 5235.6
and that's the whole point about the mud

5233.44 --> 5237.839999999999
flood is that it isn't suggested that

5235.6 --> 5240.2390000000005
the entire landscape is rearranged it's

5237.84 --> 5242.4800000000005
just a layer of mud came there

5240.239 --> 5242.48
well

5242.719 --> 5246.2390000000005
if there was an actual

5244.639 --> 5249.76
flood like

5246.239 --> 5251.919999999999
the the flood the great flood

5249.76 --> 5254.320000000001
it's literally gonna just completely

5251.92 --> 5256.639
rearrange the landscape right it's not

5254.32 --> 5259.04
just gonna oh a little layer of mud

5256.639 --> 5261.04
there cover some building no no

5259.04 --> 5263.199
literally buildings everything will just

5261.04 --> 5263.199
be

5264.719 --> 5267.84
completely trashed

5268.159 --> 5272.4
i mean you'd be lucky if a pyramid still

5270.56 --> 5276.0
is in one place

5272.4 --> 5276.0
after a flood right

5279.6 --> 5282.719
waters below no

5284.639 --> 5288.0
no

5285.76 --> 5288.0
what

5288.639 --> 5291.52
no

5289.44 --> 5294.08
that would literally just mean oceans

5291.52 --> 5296.080000000001
rising effectively

5294.08 --> 5298.32
and ocean's rising is not going to cause

5296.08 --> 5301.48
a mudflow it's just going to cause

5298.32 --> 5301.48
a flood

5317.44 --> 5320.4
yeah

5318.239 --> 5321.839999999999
yeah i've seen that too

5320.4 --> 5324.638999999999
and there's also just natural

5321.84 --> 5327.28
liquefaction events like seeing plenty

5324.639 --> 5330.719
of videos where in brazil

5327.28 --> 5333.759999999999
like just seemingly out of nowhere like

5330.719 --> 5337.04
a hill just an entire hill just suddenly

5333.76 --> 5339.280000000001
breaks off and just

5337.04 --> 5341.36
right liquefaction

5339.28 --> 5346.5199999999995
just out of nowhere

5341.36 --> 5346.5199999999995
like grass patches on it and all

5356.96 --> 5361.36
right with vibration you don't need

5358.96 --> 5361.36
water

5361.6 --> 5366.159000000001
but the water

5363.28 --> 5370.679
can also like if there's a lot of water

5366.159 --> 5370.679
it does kind of help the condition

5386.4 --> 5390.719
okay i don't know what kind of drugs you

5388.08 --> 5393.84
are on jose but

5390.719 --> 5393.84
i don't want some of that

5403.12 --> 5407.84
right yeah flatters yeah that is a

5405.199 --> 5408.96
potential

5407.84 --> 5413.679
possible

5408.96 --> 5415.84
cause for the mudblood indeed a giant

5413.679 --> 5418.32
like

5415.84 --> 5421.1990000000005
earthquake that's just that just

5418.32 --> 5423.28
resonated in exactly

5421.199 --> 5424.879999999999
the right frequency and then just

5423.28 --> 5427.36
suddenly cost

5424.88 --> 5428.88
caused a massive cascade of

5427.36 --> 5430.32
liquefaction

5428.88 --> 5435.0
yeah

5430.32 --> 5435.0
it's what i think probably caused it

5472.719 --> 5477.84
oh really start singing style

5475.36 --> 5477.839999999999
okay

5480.56 --> 5485.4400000000005
you think that like a polarity switch

5486.48 --> 5491.599999999999
would cause liquefaction

5489.28 --> 5494.48
huh

5491.6 --> 5494.4800000000005
how would that work

5501.92 --> 5506.0
i mean i can't really connect it in my

5503.679 --> 5508.639
mind but

5506.0 --> 5511.639
there might be something to it i don't

5508.639 --> 5511.639
know

5536.0 --> 5541.199
yeah borders but yeah right you could

5538.08 --> 5542.0
literally be on a floating island

5541.199 --> 5545.04
just

5542.0 --> 5547.36
a patch with grass and all

5545.04 --> 5549.6
that's literally just moving like

5547.36 --> 5551.839999999999
literally the entire entire piece of

5549.6 --> 5553.360000000001
landscape could just be moving if you're

5551.84 --> 5555.12
lucky it's not going to break up right

5553.36 --> 5560.12
where you stand right

5555.12 --> 5560.12
but yeah so crazy sights there

5560.48 --> 5565.48
really scary by the way very dangerous

5577.64 --> 5580.899
[Music]

5605.44 --> 5608.44
so

5626.88 --> 5629.88
this

5633.679 --> 5637.4400000000005
the tarot teaches this what

5640.639 --> 5645.6
i think i'm gonna round out the

5642.84 --> 5646.639
show not too long from now

5645.6 --> 5649.1990000000005
it's just

5646.639 --> 5651.76
my jaw still nagging

5649.199 --> 5651.759999999999
it's just

5652.96 --> 5656.32
i blame it for all the silent moments

5655.04 --> 5659.12
today

5656.32 --> 5661.04
it's just very distracting i really hope

5659.12 --> 5664.04
it's gonna recede

5661.04 --> 5664.04
tomorrow

5678.56 --> 5683.8
are those birds and yeah that was a hen

5686.08 --> 5690.0
there's like a chicken coo somewhere

5687.76 --> 5691.4400000000005
very close here

5690.0 --> 5693.95
right down there

5691.44 --> 5695.119
and sometimes the hand goes

5693.95 --> 5698.679
[Music]

5695.119 --> 5698.679
gets very enthusiastic

5708.56 --> 5711.56
hmm

and

6074.32 --> 6082.08
regenerate myself out of this nuisance

6079.52 --> 6084.88
keep an eye on paypal oh okay thanks

6082.08 --> 6088.04
rick beck i really appreciate that

6084.88 --> 6088.04
i will

6096.48 --> 6099.5199999999995
right

6097.36 --> 6101.119
yeah but anyway again thanks everyone

6099.52 --> 6103.52
for coming it's been really nice you

6101.119 --> 6107.36
guys were like pretty

6103.52 --> 6109.280000000001
chatty today i like that

6107.36 --> 6112.0
it's just that

6109.28 --> 6114.639
it's it's yeah the throughout the entire

6112.0 --> 6115.52
show it's been hurting

6114.639 --> 6116.96
so

6115.52 --> 6119.360000000001
not really like

6116.96 --> 6122.56
hurting but still like me

6119.36 --> 6124.88
and it's just distracting it's it's very

6122.56 --> 6126.8
tough to focus for a longer period like

6124.88 --> 6128.56
if i have a really strong train of

6126.8 --> 6131.6
thought then yeah i can roll it and i

6128.56 --> 6133.119000000001
have in the show it's just as as soon as

6131.6 --> 6134.400000000001
a thought is rounded out it's just

6133.119 --> 6136.08
immediately like

6134.4 --> 6138.08
get back

6136.08 --> 6141.5199999999995
and just like

6138.08 --> 6144.0
basically zone out because that's when i

6141.52 --> 6146.639
zone out it's kind of part of a

6144.0 --> 6149.92
spiritual restoration meditation effect

6146.639 --> 6152.56
it's literally what i do to stop pain

6149.92 --> 6152.56
and it works

6153.44 --> 6158.4
but yeah it is very distracting

6156.08 --> 6159.92
what happened nothing special it's just

6158.4 --> 6162.48
a freaking jaw

6159.92 --> 6164.08
you know i've all this like weird broken

6162.48 --> 6166.239
feelings and [ __ ]

6164.08 --> 6168.639
and it's been going great

6166.239 --> 6170.718999999999
yeah it's like

6168.639 --> 6173.76
just don't panic

6170.719 --> 6177.28
it's a bit of a nuisance but

6173.76 --> 6179.76
i think i bit on like a piece of pizza

6177.28 --> 6181.5199999999995
in the wrong way yesterday and now it's

6179.76 --> 6183.6
kind of sore

6181.52 --> 6186.159000000001
and it's really distracting so that is

6183.6 --> 6187.1990000000005
all it's nothing really bad

6186.159 --> 6189.119
i hope

6187.199 --> 6190.638999999999
probably not it's not like the first

6189.119 --> 6193.04
time that's happened it's but it's

6190.639 --> 6193.92
really distracting what it does

6193.04 --> 6196.239
so

6193.92 --> 6198.56
but i'll be all right

6196.239 --> 6201.199
strokers i don't i don't take sugar

6198.56 --> 6204.88
george sanford i literally don't at all

6201.199 --> 6207.759999999999
last time i had sugar was in my

6204.88 --> 6212.4800000000005
coffee test when is it two weeks ago

6207.76 --> 6214.639
already i had one coffee test with sugar

6212.48 --> 6216.48
i don't take sugar

6214.639 --> 6218.159000000001
never on anything

6216.48 --> 6220.4
like except accepting coffee and i don't

6218.159 --> 6222.239
drink coffee anymore and so that's not

6220.4 --> 6225.5199999999995
the problem

6222.239 --> 6225.5199999999995
also yeah some of these

6226.0 --> 6233.199
the situation is is that

6229.36 --> 6235.5199999999995
well teeth also kind of in ways restore

6233.199 --> 6238.719
themselves and maybe potentially

6235.52 --> 6241.119000000001
regenerate to some degree

6238.719 --> 6242.88
right well all regeneration typically

6241.119 --> 6246.599999999999
has like

6242.88 --> 6246.6
make things soar

6246.88 --> 6252.96
so this could literally be a good thing

6250.96 --> 6256.159
from a certain perspective

6252.96 --> 6258.2390000000005
right it could end up better afterward

6256.159 --> 6260.48
so

6258.239 --> 6262.4
go fund me for a dental care it's a good

6260.48 --> 6264.638999999999
luck with that you know how freaking

6262.4 --> 6265.599999999999
much money that costs

6264.639 --> 6267.6
dude

6265.6 --> 6269.92
i just want to eat i just want to be

6267.6 --> 6272.400000000001
able to eat okay

6269.92 --> 6275.04
i don't have a freaking i

6272.4 --> 6277.04
i can't get money together for

6275.04 --> 6280.96
for like a serious dental offer you know

6277.04 --> 6284.0
how many thousands of euros that cost

6280.96 --> 6285.679
to get that all done properly

6284.0 --> 6287.76
or maybe not well

6285.679 --> 6291.76
maybe that a lot

6287.76 --> 6291.76
more than i have available right

6296.719 --> 6300.4800000000005
so

6297.76 --> 6302.8
it's a nice idea but unless you actually

6300.48 --> 6305.04
want to lay down the money for that

6302.8 --> 6306.320000000001
dental plan

6305.04 --> 6310.639
i'm not gonna

6306.32 --> 6310.639
do that it just won't work out

6310.719 --> 6315.719
oh damn i didn't know what's l what's

6312.719 --> 6315.719
yeah

6316.0 --> 6321.199
i mean

6317.119 --> 6321.199
i have basically two broken fillings

6323.28 --> 6328.159
it's not gonna be like a devastating

6325.52 --> 6329.040000000001
operation or anything

6328.159 --> 6332.32
but

6329.04 --> 6332.32
it's still gonna cost

6334.159 --> 6338.08
if i

6335.119 --> 6339.839999999999
if i really needed to do that

6338.08 --> 6341.92
but i'm mostly just trying to learn and

6339.84 --> 6343.4400000000005
live with it because that's a lot

6341.92 --> 6347.76
cheaper

6343.44 --> 6349.919999999999
and i do kind of want to trust

6347.76 --> 6353.76
how nature works at that right

6349.92 --> 6357.4400000000005
animals don't get dentists either

6353.76 --> 6359.04
and they can survive they have survived

6357.44 --> 6360.96
species over

6359.04 --> 6362.88
countless generations have survived

6360.96 --> 6365.52
without dentists so

6362.88 --> 6368.159000000001
i'm trying to figure it out

6365.52 --> 6370.4800000000005
and basically relying on my own

6368.159 --> 6373.679
confidence to just not be like oh you

6370.48 --> 6376.638999999999
need to get it done right now

6373.679 --> 6380.4800000000005
like that right don't fear

6376.639 --> 6380.4800000000005
don't fear anything there

6383.119 --> 6386.36
i don't

6386.4 --> 6392.4
not afraid of any kind of pain

6389.04 --> 6396.56
unless it's like mind-blowing but yeah

6392.4 --> 6396.5599999999995
it's not it isn't so far thank god

6397.6 --> 6403.679
right but yeah i do need support for

6400.239 --> 6406.08
food though because yeah lack of money

6403.679 --> 6408.639
will cause stress

6406.08 --> 6410.96
on the short run and that will actually

6408.639 --> 6412.56
negatively influence my health condition

6410.96 --> 6414.96
overall

6412.56 --> 6416.320000000001
so i think that if i just get money for

6414.96 --> 6419.199
food and all that

6416.32 --> 6422.08
maybe a couple of smokes here and there

6419.199 --> 6425.919999999999
that would probably help restore my

6422.08 --> 6427.76
issues with my jaw a lot better

6425.92 --> 6430.0
than just getting money together for

6427.76 --> 6433.92
some dental plan

6430.0 --> 6433.92
which i doubt that's gonna work

6434.639 --> 6439.04
but it's a nice thought though maybe in

6436.159 --> 6442.719
the future somewhere

6439.04 --> 6443.76
right anyway sorry for the long outro

6442.719 --> 6445.44
