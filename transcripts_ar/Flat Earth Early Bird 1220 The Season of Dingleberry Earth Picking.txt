beautiful again

91.28 --> 96.479
though there's

93.92 --> 99.68
some trails

96.479 --> 102.96
in there well not so much directly above

99.68 --> 103.759
me i also noticed this yesterday

102.96 --> 105.67999999999999
that

103.759 --> 108.399
it stayed clear pretty much throughout

105.68 --> 110.56
the entire day but i could like see

108.399 --> 112.399
way in the distance a spot where there

110.56 --> 116.399
were trails

112.399 --> 116.399
they just never really moved

116.799 --> 120.71900000000001
over me right

118.399 --> 122.719
and it's not also like oh it's right

120.719 --> 125.19999999999999
above the city center or anything no it

122.719 --> 125.19999999999999
was just

125.6 --> 131.68
i think more west from here

128.399 --> 132.959
like significant amounts more west

131.68 --> 135.28
so

132.959 --> 137.84
yeah up here it seems all pretty blue

135.28 --> 137.84
and clear

138.64 --> 143.83999999999997
but i have seen some planes leaving

141.44 --> 143.84
things

144.239 --> 149.59900000000002
even this morning

146.48 --> 152.16
but yeah not so much right above more in

149.599 --> 156.2
the distance and yeah beside that it's

152.16 --> 156.2
still super beautiful

160.319 --> 165.04
birds are really enjoying the water i

162.319 --> 165.04
leave behind

165.599 --> 170.48
i just put a fresh bowl of water there

168.0 --> 172.08
and like immediately this magpie just

170.48 --> 175.35999999999999
dove into it

172.08 --> 177.68
and he took three baths

175.36 --> 180.0
i was like oh yeah nice bath then you

177.68 --> 182.31900000000002
walk to the side and then like hmm i

180.0 --> 184.48
want to go again

182.319 --> 186.64
went in again

184.48 --> 188.0
then he came out i was like yeah yeah oh

186.64 --> 190.39999999999998
that was great

188.0 --> 192.319
one more time

190.4 --> 194.159
and yeah now there's almost nothing left

192.319 --> 197.39999999999998
so i'm gonna have to refill that after

194.159 --> 197.4
the show

198.4 --> 201.84
but

199.44 --> 203.04
beautiful

201.84 --> 206.239
warm

203.04 --> 206.239
sun is nice and warm

210.08 --> 215.28
there's some gardening activities going

212.72 --> 218.56
on here and there

215.28 --> 218.56
grass has been moaned

219.519 --> 226.12
because it does start to grow a lot

222.56 --> 226.12
during this time

226.159 --> 228.48
all right

231.12 --> 235.92000000000002
hello borders boy first in chat

234.64 --> 240.92
wrath

235.92 --> 240.92
m kevlar good to see you all

240.959 --> 247.159
it is thursday the 21st of april 2022.

252.799 --> 258.23900000000003
yeah my jaw's feeling better just a

255.36 --> 260.47900000000004
little bit better every time

258.239 --> 262.23999999999995
i think like the overall regeneration

260.479 --> 263.59999999999997
process

262.24 --> 264.40000000000003
which is like

263.6 --> 266.56
uh

264.4 --> 268.63899999999995
post inflammation because i don't think

266.56 --> 272.0
it's really there anymore

268.639 --> 273.84000000000003
like no issues it's only just like

272.0 --> 276.4
yeah

273.84 --> 278.4
redecorated flesh

276.4 --> 280.56
that's the kind of

278.4 --> 283.03999999999996
yeah get back to the old shape that

280.56 --> 284.96
might take a while

283.04 --> 288.639
but yeah doing good

284.96 --> 288.63899999999995
feeling good feeling strong

293.04 --> 297.28000000000003
getting more inspiration and yeah

295.04 --> 300.0
yesterday's show was very inspired i

297.28 --> 301.52
watched part of it back

300.0 --> 303.36
because i really wanted to give it a

301.52 --> 306.639
title because it was a good show like

303.36 --> 306.639
every part of it was good

307.28 --> 311.19899999999996
so i did

309.36 --> 312.72
gave it a

311.199 --> 315.039
a title

312.72 --> 317.6
scattered befitting to like all the

315.039 --> 319.68
different subjects that i addressed

317.6 --> 322.8
right so yeah hopefully i can do a show

319.68 --> 322.8
like that today as well

322.84 --> 325.59999999999997
depends

324.479 --> 328.0
of course

325.6 --> 330.0
the interaction with chat

328.0 --> 331.52
so how's the weather

330.0 --> 332.96
where you are at

331.52 --> 336.71999999999997
is it

332.96 --> 336.71999999999997
as beautiful as this

336.96 --> 342.0
because yeah some spots that seems to be

339.759 --> 344.32
snowing in the united states

342.0 --> 347.28
neil was completely like neil cosentino

344.32 --> 350.88
was complaining about how his

347.28 --> 353.19899999999996
uh his pepper crops basically all in

350.88 --> 354.8
paprika or whatever all died out because

353.199 --> 356.16
it suddenly snowed

354.8 --> 357.759
on top of it

356.16 --> 360.8
apparently he didn't build it in some

357.759 --> 360.8
kind of a greenhouse

362.0 --> 364.319
all right

364.639 --> 368.40000000000003
i mean

365.52 --> 371.039
it's not like new york is definitely not

368.4 --> 371.039
mexico

377.28 --> 381.84
uh hey elise g good to see you

382.08 --> 385.59999999999997
right got some green tea

386.8 --> 391.199
and some blood orange juice

392.08 --> 396.71999999999997
which might be my

395.759 --> 398.639
favorite

396.72 --> 401.03900000000004
drink now

398.639 --> 405.6
even yeah at least during this spring

401.039 --> 405.59999999999997
it's tasting so good and it feels great

407.039 --> 410.71999999999997
normally i'm really big fan of

408.56 --> 413.84
grapefruit juice but like this

410.72 --> 413.84000000000003
it feels even better

414.0 --> 417.0
anyway

422.96 --> 427.35999999999996
i was having like this silly

425.36 --> 429.759
but not silly just a conversation with

427.36 --> 432.08000000000004
this this baller guy who's also donated

429.759 --> 432.08000000000004
to me

435.84 --> 441.52
yeah i talked to him over skype and i i

438.8 --> 444.319
tried to like explain some things

441.52 --> 448.84
like oh yeah i did pretty good on fed

444.319 --> 452.24
and he was like what is fed it's like

448.84 --> 454.79999999999995
uh nathan oakley's flatters debate

452.24 --> 457.039
he's never heard of that

454.8 --> 460.56
what

457.039 --> 462.88
i referenced that all the time

460.56 --> 464.639
that was very confusing there

462.88 --> 466.319
but apparently there are ballers out

464.639 --> 468.96000000000004
there that don't know what flat earth

466.319 --> 468.96000000000004
the bait is

470.72 --> 475.52000000000004
he doesn't really seem to care he's just

472.639 --> 478.56
apparently interested in my show so

475.52 --> 481.599
okay cool

478.56 --> 486.16
talking about which i've had

481.599 --> 487.36
an influx of subscribers recently

486.16 --> 489.59900000000005
like

487.36 --> 493.24
is it

489.599 --> 493.24
30 or so

495.12 --> 501.96
and it's sticking so yeah there's new

497.199 --> 501.96000000000004
subscribers uh yeah welcome

506.0 --> 509.759
lot of you might just be watching

511.28 --> 515.76
because of course you gotta figure out

512.959 --> 518.8
who is this guy you know

515.76 --> 521.2
and i'm kind of like a bit notorious for

518.8 --> 523.12
getting really pissed off so you yeah i

521.2 --> 524.48
get it you want to figure out like the

523.12 --> 526.08
code

524.48 --> 527.279
how to deal with that before you

526.08 --> 529.0400000000001
approach

527.279 --> 531.06
very sensible

529.04 --> 532.56
right just like with owen benjamin

531.06 --> 535.1199999999999
[Music]

532.56 --> 538.56
who's by the way a lot stricter with it

535.12 --> 543.12
but then again he there's so many people

538.56 --> 543.1199999999999
basically rolling over his digital floor

545.76 --> 549.8389999999999
hey flatter sage good to see you

552.8 --> 555.3599999999999
rick beck

559.519 --> 564.16
new england yeah at least yeah but new

561.839 --> 566.24
england

564.16 --> 569.12
yeah you you will absolutely need a

566.24 --> 569.12
greenhouse there

572.64 --> 577.1999999999999
because that is very far north

575.6 --> 579.6800000000001
i think that's like on the level of

577.2 --> 579.6800000000001
iceland

587.839 --> 592.32
right but yeah greenhouses you know are

590.88 --> 594.48
pretty simple

592.32 --> 597.279
or they can be simple you can make them

594.48 --> 599.839
like super fancy

597.279 --> 603.4399999999999
like really professional level if you

599.839 --> 606.0
gotta plan out how like you wanna

603.44 --> 608.8000000000001
do tomatoes it's like okay how big do

606.0 --> 611.6
you want it right you could make like

608.8 --> 613.04
towering tomato plants that are that are

611.6 --> 614.72
just like

613.04 --> 617.36
crawling up a rope or something i've

614.72 --> 619.36
seen like professional

617.36 --> 621.2
people do it like that

619.36 --> 622.72
like there was this farm that where we

621.2 --> 623.839
used to go for

622.72 --> 625.6
like

623.839 --> 626.8000000000001
fresh

625.6 --> 627.76
organic

626.8 --> 630.56
beef

627.76 --> 632.959
it's just amazing like really high

630.56 --> 635.68
quality and so fresh it's like

632.959 --> 638.3199999999999
the next the day after slaughter

635.68 --> 638.3199999999999
in the morning

639.36 --> 644.399
or even like i don't know but it's that

641.36 --> 647.04
was the best and they also had tomato

644.399 --> 649.36
plants and the way they did had this

647.04 --> 651.519
big greenhouse

649.36 --> 653.12
and they just had these ropes suspended

651.519 --> 654.64
and they just

653.12 --> 655.6
tomato plants

654.64 --> 657.4399999999999
would

655.6 --> 659.6800000000001
yeah they would kind of tie them up to

657.44 --> 662.0
crawl up the rope

659.68 --> 663.92
genius

662.0 --> 665.92
that's what i'm gonna remember because

663.92 --> 667.12
tomatoes is definitely something that i

665.92 --> 670.0
wanna

667.12 --> 671.76
like produce because i like tomatoes and

670.0 --> 673.6
like well there's nothing better than

671.76 --> 677.6
like

673.6 --> 679.9200000000001
spaghetti sauce with fresh

677.6 --> 681.6800000000001
home-grown tomatoes

679.92 --> 683.279
and i like spaghetti

681.68 --> 684.56
especially when i got home-grown

683.279 --> 685.76
tomatoes

684.56 --> 689.0
so

685.76 --> 689.0
but yeah

690.959 --> 693.8389999999999
so many tricks

696.88 --> 701.12
yeah and with when i was still with my

699.76 --> 703.92
ex

701.12 --> 707.76
like we made a like a tiny little

703.92 --> 709.92
greenhouse which is basically just a

707.76 --> 712.3199999999999
like

709.92 --> 715.519
a half a box with the with a plate of

712.32 --> 715.519
plexiglas on it

715.68 --> 721.1999999999999
that you could like hold open

718.72 --> 723.6
and that's it and that did great for

721.2 --> 727.2
some peppers

723.6 --> 727.2
and like cherry tomatoes and

728.079 --> 734.16
yeah that was great and it's so small so

731.68 --> 736.079
simple like all of that together like

734.16 --> 738.56
wouldn't have cost more than like 50

736.079 --> 738.56
euros

742.399 --> 750.24
oh thank you for showing that leg

746.0 --> 750.24
he's showing me his greenhouse

750.72 --> 754.32
so plastic sheet based

755.12 --> 758.9590000000001
is it

756.959 --> 760.959
it doesn't look very transparent or is

758.959 --> 763.1999999999999
that because of like the moist that's in

760.959 --> 763.1999999999999
there

765.2 --> 768.48
i mean i hope you still get plenty of

766.88 --> 771.72
sun

communicating with anybody in chat so

962.8 --> 965.8

991.279 --> 994.72
the lid

992.32 --> 994.72
i guess

994.959 --> 999.5999999999999
cucumbers tomatoes carrots cool

1007.759 --> 1012.88
it's measuring the heaven rotation right

1020.32 --> 1026.4
or at least like the the light the

1022.399 --> 1030.16
angles of the light operation up there

1026.4 --> 1031.679
that's that's what you're measuring

1030.16 --> 1033.679
oh wait you were not talking about

1031.679 --> 1036.72
angles you're talking about a gyroscope

1033.679 --> 1036.72
rotation really

1037.36 --> 1045.039
you're you're still gonna like it

1040.959 --> 1048.0
did like are you sean hawkins or

1045.039 --> 1053.24
somebody that hangs out with him

1048.0 --> 1053.24
or you you have amnesia issues

1054.72 --> 1057.52
because

1055.6 --> 1059.6
how many times have i explained about

1057.52 --> 1064.12
the gyroscope by now

1059.6 --> 1064.12
in the last seven years

1068.24 --> 1070.88
yeah

1069.12 --> 1073.1999999999998
right so

1070.88 --> 1074.0
yeah about the gyroscope there was only

1073.2 --> 1075.6000000000001
one

1074.0 --> 1079.84
gyroscope

1075.6 --> 1082.3999999999999
which had a an apparent 15 degree

1079.84 --> 1084.0
and there was a ring laser gyroscope

1082.4 --> 1085.2
right

1084.0 --> 1086.64
done

1085.2 --> 1088.0800000000002
over

1086.64 --> 1089.76
it's over

1088.08 --> 1092.96
right

1089.76 --> 1095.52
you know why why it's over

1092.96 --> 1097.28
when i say there's only one gyroscope

1095.52 --> 1098.559
that actually had a drift

1097.28 --> 1102.32
because

1098.559 --> 1103.6
if the gyroscope would have been

1102.32 --> 1104.72
drifting

1103.6 --> 1107.9189999999999
because

1104.72 --> 1111.3600000000001
it is placed on top of a ball earth

1107.919 --> 1114.0
that's rotating underneath it

1111.36 --> 1116.32
then all of the gyroscopes would have

1114.0 --> 1118.48
had to have drifted

1116.32 --> 1121.4399999999998
and they haven't it was only the ring

1118.48 --> 1123.2
laser gyroscope that drifted

1121.44 --> 1124.96
so it can't be because the earth is

1123.2 --> 1127.76
spinning because if the earth were

1124.96 --> 1130.48
spinning underneath it then all of the

1127.76 --> 1134.48
gyroscopes in exactly the same fashion

1130.48 --> 1134.48
would have had to have drifted

1134.64 --> 1140.24
and they didn't

1137.6 --> 1142.7199999999998
so it's over right there

1140.24 --> 1145.52
now of course you can explore us to what

1142.72 --> 1146.799
why did the ring laser gyroscope drift

1145.52 --> 1149.039
yeah that's

1146.799 --> 1151.12
it's a bit of a mystery isn't it yeah

1149.039 --> 1153.44
well a ring laser gyroscope isn't

1151.12 --> 1155.36
actually like a mechanical gyroscope an

1153.44 --> 1159.039
object

1155.36 --> 1160.32
where it is an object that is

1159.039 --> 1163.6
yeah

1160.32 --> 1164.48
put into like the the spinning momentum

1163.6 --> 1166.799
thing

1164.48 --> 1168.799
where it stays rigid

1166.799 --> 1170.799
it's not like that it's light there's

1168.799 --> 1173.039
something happening with light and the

1170.799 --> 1176.0
readout of light

1173.039 --> 1178.16
so yeah there is light drifting in the

1176.0 --> 1180.96
ring laser gyroscope because that's the

1178.16 --> 1183.6000000000001
effective substance

1180.96 --> 1186.0
that is being manipulated through the

1183.6 --> 1188.8799999999999
design of the device it's light so

1186.0 --> 1189.919
there's a light drift fascinating right

1188.88 --> 1192.64
yeah

1189.919 --> 1193.6000000000001
there's also happens to be this light

1192.64 --> 1195.5200000000002
drift

1193.6 --> 1196.32
in the lights in the sky

1195.52 --> 1198.0
so

1196.32 --> 1199.4399999999998
is there a direct

1198.0 --> 1200.72
connection

1199.44 --> 1202.4
perhaps

1200.72 --> 1204.08
it's interesting

1202.4 --> 1206.88
but one thing

1204.08 --> 1209.6
it absolutely isn't and that is proof

1206.88 --> 1211.5200000000002
that the earth is rotating underneath it

1209.6 --> 1214.0
because if that would have been the

1211.52 --> 1216.72
cause then all gyroscopes would have to

1214.0 --> 1219.36
drift in exactly the same fashion and

1216.72 --> 1222.08
they don't

1219.36 --> 1222.08
so it's over

1222.96 --> 1227.1200000000001
your name is debunked

1227.36 --> 1231.6399999999999
as a ball earth proof

1238.4 --> 1241.439
[Music]

1247.6 --> 1251.76
yeah the bowlers are

1249.44 --> 1254.64
they probably have blue balls right now

1251.76 --> 1257.2
i mean it is spring

1254.64 --> 1261.3200000000002
they must be squirting so they probably

1257.2 --> 1261.32
got blue balls right now

1268.08 --> 1275.84
they're trying to restock up on balls by

1271.6 --> 1277.84
basically harvesting for globe belief

1275.84 --> 1280.24
so so they're just hoping they're

1277.84 --> 1282.08
basically seeking in rough territory

1280.24 --> 1283.039
where everybody knowingly is a flat

1282.08 --> 1284.96
earther

1283.039 --> 1287.12
is pretty much immune to them but

1284.96 --> 1288.559
they're still seeking basically to

1287.12 --> 1290.52
harvest like these

1288.559 --> 1293.36
little berries like

1290.52 --> 1295.36
accidental globe belief in us in a

1293.36 --> 1298.0
singular moment right they go around

1295.36 --> 1300.0
flat earth is hoping to pick like this

1298.0 --> 1302.24
oh he still said

1300.0 --> 1305.2
that something that could hint at that

1302.24 --> 1308.4
it might be a globe by mistake

1305.2 --> 1311.2
so they go out and harvest like those

1308.4 --> 1313.2800000000002
mistaking those dingleberries basically

1311.2 --> 1315.3600000000001
the accidental dingleberries that flat

1313.28 --> 1319.1589999999999
earthers might yield

1315.36 --> 1319.1589999999999
that's what they do now

1319.52 --> 1325.2
because just picking the

1322.48 --> 1328.799
does the overripe

1325.2 --> 1330.32
regular normie globe beliefs that's

1328.799 --> 1332.1589999999999
i think yeah

1330.32 --> 1334.799
they're not nutritious enough it's not

1332.159 --> 1336.5590000000002
enough globe essence

1334.799 --> 1339.2
within those things because the normies

1336.559 --> 1341.28
don't really know enough

1339.2 --> 1343.1200000000001
about the globe belief right we know

1341.28 --> 1344.8799999999999
more so

1343.12 --> 1346.7199999999998
our nutrition

1344.88 --> 1350.7990000000002
when it comes to global leave to be

1346.72 --> 1354.08
harvested is much more rich and

1350.799 --> 1356.24
nourishing the globe belief in itself

1354.08 --> 1358.84
so they come by

1356.24 --> 1362.08
globe trolls and anti-flat earthers to

1358.84 --> 1365.4399999999998
basically see if they can pick some

1362.08 --> 1368.08
dingleberries from the flat earthers

1365.44 --> 1370.559
for when the moments of interaction

1368.08 --> 1372.96
where they accidentally say something

1370.559 --> 1374.96
that could hint at that it might be a

1372.96 --> 1377.8400000000001
globe by accident right

1374.96 --> 1380.88
they harvest that

1377.84 --> 1382.32
it's like a religious ceremony like

1380.88 --> 1384.24
picking the berries picking the

1382.32 --> 1386.0
dingleberries

1384.24 --> 1389.2
among flat earthers right of these

1386.0 --> 1391.2
really hostile bushes that yields

1389.2 --> 1392.96
very little glow belief

1391.2 --> 1395.679
but if you know what you're doing then

1392.96 --> 1397.6000000000001
you might pick these these accidental

1395.679 --> 1400.0800000000002
dingleberries and that's like very

1397.6 --> 1402.3999999999999
nutritious for some reason

1400.08 --> 1406.559
so the anti-flat earthers

1402.4 --> 1408.5590000000002
it reinvigorates their globe belief

1406.559 --> 1410.48
i mean in ways i think that many

1408.559 --> 1412.559
anti-flat earthers that are truly and

1410.48 --> 1414.96
permanently stuck in that mindset in the

1412.559 --> 1416.72
reverse role of it

1414.96 --> 1417.919
that they might even go as far as to

1416.72 --> 1419.28
believe that

1417.919 --> 1421.6000000000001
flat earthers

1419.28 --> 1424.1589999999999
are like a resource to them because they

1421.6 --> 1427.52
know so much about the globe despite not

1424.159 --> 1430.7990000000002
believing in it maybe they treasure our

1427.52 --> 1433.039
knowledge of the globe

1430.799 --> 1436.08
not in interactions because we use it

1433.039 --> 1438.08
defensively but because there is the

1436.08 --> 1440.72
knowledge there

1438.08 --> 1444.08
and they are probably catching on that

1440.72 --> 1445.44
there's just general dementia going on

1444.08 --> 1448.32
people are becoming dumber more

1445.44 --> 1450.4
idiocratic and flat earthers might be

1448.32 --> 1452.48
the last hope

1450.4 --> 1455.039
for the globe religion because we're the

1452.48 --> 1456.88
ones that actually know all the details

1455.039 --> 1459.84
because of our interaction

1456.88 --> 1459.8400000000001
with the globers

1467.44 --> 1470.3200000000002
yes rick back

1471.36 --> 1475.36
dude i've i've got

1473.2 --> 1476.799
like seven years of field experience

1475.36 --> 1479.279
with this

1476.799 --> 1484.0
i know what globers do

1479.279 --> 1486.24
they love to go out among flat earthers

1484.0 --> 1488.4
and then see if they can make flat

1486.24 --> 1491.279
earther say something

1488.4 --> 1493.039
that could accidentally prove the ball

1491.279 --> 1495.279
earth even though they'd never stand

1493.039 --> 1497.84
behind it right

1495.279 --> 1500.84
and yeah dingleberry picking they love

1497.84 --> 1500.84
it

1505.2 --> 1510.0
i'm gonna call this episode that

1507.919 --> 1512.48
dingleberry picking that's

1510.0 --> 1517.159
that's great

1512.48 --> 1517.159
it's a season of dingleberry picking

1561.0 --> 1565.679
interdementia travel is possible i like

1563.6 --> 1567.52
that dominoid

1565.679 --> 1569.44
i like the way you get creative with

1567.52 --> 1574.279
words like that

1569.44 --> 1574.279
i i do that too in chats

1585.2 --> 1590.48
wow look look at bob nodell's gyroscope

1588.4 --> 1592.799
there he's not even

1590.48 --> 1595.3600000000001
these he's already just completely

1592.799 --> 1597.52
abandoned even the the title of his

1595.36 --> 1599.76
account

1597.52 --> 1604.0
he's abandoned the argument very wise by

1599.76 --> 1604.0
the way because there is absolutely no

1604.159 --> 1609.0390000000002
no where you can go with that one

1606.88 --> 1612.3200000000002
i mean

1609.039 --> 1615.279
that's like hoping you can get low

1612.32 --> 1617.2
hanging dingleberry fruits from flat

1615.279 --> 1619.2
earth or spot no dell's gyroscope it's

1617.2 --> 1621.679
not gonna happen

1619.2 --> 1623.8400000000001
like there's no low hanging dingleberry

1621.679 --> 1625.679
fruits coming it's not gonna happen

1623.84 --> 1627.6
really

1625.679 --> 1630.0800000000002
right but this at home is not really

1627.6 --> 1632.24
going to yield any

1630.08 --> 1633.76
any dingleberries either

1632.24 --> 1637.6
so i don't know what you're still doing

1633.76 --> 1637.6
here you might want to move on to more

1638.84 --> 1644.0
yeah

1640.64 --> 1644.0
more ignorant grounds

1644.24 --> 1648.6
maybe you could try somewhere else

1657.679 --> 1661.8400000000001
and

1659.36 --> 1663.4399999999998
no you're just not well you used it as

1661.84 --> 1667.08
an argument didn't you

1663.44 --> 1667.0800000000002
for your ball earth

1668.559 --> 1672.559
then i explained it

1671.12 --> 1674.9599999999998
in detail

1672.559 --> 1676.799
why that doesn't work

1674.96 --> 1680.039
and now you're just at homing people in

1676.799 --> 1680.039
my chat

1691.1 --> 1694.3
[Music]

1695.84 --> 1697.9189999999999
you

1697.98 --> 1701.099
[Music]

1713.76 --> 1718.48
doesn't get more ignorant than flat

1715.44 --> 1718.48
earth based on what

1719.12 --> 1725.32
that's just kind of i think that falls

1721.44 --> 1725.3200000000002
under ad hoc statement

1733.25 --> 1736.45
[Music]

1749.2 --> 1753.679
he's having problems explaining how you

1751.6 --> 1755.76
establish an elevation angle from a

1753.679 --> 1757.52
curved adjacent

1755.76 --> 1759.36
well anybody would have trouble with

1757.52 --> 1761.6
that right

1759.36 --> 1765.84
because

1761.6 --> 1768.1589999999999
what that does is basically force like a

1765.84 --> 1770.24
globe reality

1768.159 --> 1772.0
onto like

1770.24 --> 1774.32
to supersede

1772.0 --> 1776.88
them the way they think

1774.32 --> 1779.6789999999999
when they apply their model

1776.88 --> 1781.919
like the globe earth is never like they

1779.679 --> 1783.8400000000001
don't really treat it like a euclidean

1781.919 --> 1786.3200000000002
object you know

1783.84 --> 1786.32
they don't

1786.64 --> 1790.24
like when they actually do the

1788.48 --> 1791.84
measurements and all that and the

1790.24 --> 1794.159
calculations

1791.84 --> 1797.9189999999999
they they always start with a flat plane

1794.159 --> 1797.919
and then just start to bend [ __ ]

1798.48 --> 1802.72
like when they start to feed it back to

1800.64 --> 1804.48
actual physical observation and

1802.72 --> 1806.72
measurements

1804.48 --> 1806.72
so

1807.2 --> 1813.2
like

1809.039 --> 1816.559
the way they treat the globe mechanism

1813.2 --> 1819.679
is not like literally oh look here's a

1816.559 --> 1822.32
literal ball of dirt

1819.679 --> 1824.64
they don't do that

1822.32 --> 1827.279
because it doesn't work because in every

1824.64 --> 1829.2
conceivable

1827.279 --> 1831.919
way through the senses

1829.2 --> 1833.279
immediately that's dispelled and like

1831.919 --> 1837.7990000000002
engineering

1833.279 --> 1837.799
would reveal like no that's not possible

1838.799 --> 1842.0
the

1839.679 --> 1845.679
radar goes for thousands of miles in

1842.0 --> 1848.84
straight lines and all that's like no

1845.679 --> 1850.88
no no that's just simply not

1848.84 --> 1852.9599999999998
possible right and that's why in the

1850.88 --> 1855.3600000000001
globe mechanics they basically they just

1852.96 --> 1857.44
bend everything with r

1855.36 --> 1858.8799999999999
it's like oh you got this flat plane

1857.44 --> 1861.039
everything is straight and then they

1858.88 --> 1863.679
just say r

1861.039 --> 1866.399
and then it all bends circular and then

1863.679 --> 1868.64
all the technology now works circular

1866.399 --> 1871.12
that's what they do right

1868.64 --> 1874.5590000000002
if you don't say

1871.12 --> 1874.559
was it that you said again

1877.12 --> 1883.1999999999998
yeah elevation angle with curved

1880.24 --> 1886.72
adjacent adjacent that's like taking the

1883.2 --> 1888.559
measurement to a real object ball earth

1886.72 --> 1890.08
that's not what they do

1888.559 --> 1892.1589999999999
right

1890.08 --> 1893.039
like in their demonstrations even they

1892.159 --> 1895.2
just

1893.039 --> 1897.6
like compare it to

1895.2 --> 1900.72
what's happening from the center of

1897.6 --> 1902.9599999999998
presupposed ball earth

1900.72 --> 1906.3990000000001
that's the process they go for not

1902.96 --> 1909.2
actually based on what it would be on

1906.399 --> 1909.1999999999998
the ball earth

1910.0 --> 1914.0
they just wrap it around

1915.36 --> 1920.4799999999998
but that's not like your real euclidean

1918.84 --> 1922.799
approach

1920.48 --> 1924.3990000000001
they don't actually just really take a

1922.799 --> 1926.559
ball and then

1924.399 --> 1929.6
treat it like it's the real world they

1926.559 --> 1929.6
don't even do that

1929.84 --> 1933.9189999999999
so when you say elevation angle with the

1932.32 --> 1936.08
curved adjacent and it's like yeah

1933.919 --> 1938.48
that's not possible

1936.08 --> 1942.0
even though these things exist and are

1938.48 --> 1944.08
utilized in the real world

1942.0 --> 1947.12
you couldn't do that on a ball

1944.08 --> 1949.84
so that's like that's where

1947.12 --> 1949.84
it's revealed

1950.24 --> 1956.3990000000001
the globe model is not real

1953.12 --> 1959.12
it's not euclidean it's a machination

1956.399 --> 1962.399
it's the wrapping around

1959.12 --> 1964.799
of a flat plane onto a virtual

1962.399 --> 1968.6399999999999
in your mind ball

1964.799 --> 1972.6399999999999
using a radius value and a radial

1968.64 --> 1972.64
constant bending process

1973.36 --> 1977.0
that's what you do

1996.24 --> 1999.24
jesus

2008.64 --> 2013.519
yeah i mean

2010.24 --> 2016.32
we're only just talking about it

2013.519 --> 2016.32
constantly

2017.279 --> 2023.76
so yeah this elevation angle

2019.919 --> 2023.76
thing that's used right

2024.24 --> 2029.32
how can you get that on a ball earth

2034.799 --> 2039.519
it's it's a practical

2037.76 --> 2041.519
geometric

2039.519 --> 2043.36
question

2041.519 --> 2044.88
easily oh really

2043.36 --> 2047.84
explain it to me

2044.88 --> 2047.8400000000001
how does it work

2050.96 --> 2055.919
and if you really know it other than you

2053.919 --> 2058.56
of course we know it because we have to

2055.919 --> 2061.1189999999997
say we know it against the flat earther

2058.56 --> 2061.119
use a a sex

2067.599 --> 2070.8
yeah

2068.56 --> 2070.7999999999997
no

2073.04 --> 2077.2799999999997
sexton uses the horizon

2080.24 --> 2083.4399999999996
yeah

2081.28 --> 2086.3990000000003
because the horizon is constant because

2083.44 --> 2086.399
the earth is flat

2087.04 --> 2092.159
it wasn't a ball

2088.48 --> 2094.8
you couldn't use the sextant

2092.159 --> 2094.8
doesn't work

2095.359 --> 2102.2799999999997
horizon would be highly unreliable to

2098.88 --> 2102.28
get a bearing

2117.2 --> 2122.0
yes yes of course just say yeah yeah you

2120.16 --> 2124.16
can do it you can do that you can do

2122.0 --> 2126.64
that

2124.16 --> 2128.3199999999997
of course you could pull a unicorn from

2126.64 --> 2130.7999999999997
a portal

2128.32 --> 2133.2000000000003
right you just open the portal and get

2130.8 --> 2135.92
the unicorn out i mean come on of course

2133.2 --> 2135.9199999999996
you can do that

2136.0 --> 2141.28
i mean you can just say that you can do

2138.56 --> 2145.839
that that's super cute

2141.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
that doesn't actually prove that you can

2157.68 --> 2161.44
i'm just pointing at the horizon

2161.839 --> 2166.64
if it's the horizons

2164.96 --> 2170.079
geometric

2166.64 --> 2170.0789999999997
supposed to be geometric

2171.2 --> 2176.0789999999997
it's not gonna be steady how can you use

2173.839 --> 2176.0789999999997
it

2180.88 --> 2186.0
like at this point i'm like this is

2183.44 --> 2187.52
threading outside of my personal

2186.0 --> 2189.92
expertise

2187.52 --> 2194.4
like i'd get 10th man in here he he

2189.92 --> 2194.4
would he's very sharp on the details

2195.76 --> 2200.0
i just know that

2197.599 --> 2202.56
exploration really works because it's

2200.0 --> 2204.48
all flat

2202.56 --> 2207.119
and because the star map

2204.48 --> 2207.119
is flat

2207.359 --> 2211.2799999999997
and treated as parallel

2210.16 --> 2213.5989999999997
with

2211.28 --> 2216.5600000000004
the earth

2213.599 --> 2216.56
and that's how it works

2218.24 --> 2220.72
shut up

2221.52 --> 2223.7599999999998
uh

2225.44 --> 2229.56
this is getting kind of tiresome

2239.27 --> 2243.52
[Music]

2241.119 --> 2245.76
really

2243.52 --> 2248.72
oh you can do that oh you can all do

2245.76 --> 2250.2400000000002
that oh you're all such experts you can

2248.72 --> 2253.2799999999997
all do it

2250.24 --> 2254.3999999999996
just like fight the flat earth

2253.28 --> 2256.6400000000003
yes

2254.4 --> 2259.2000000000003
and mctoon

2256.64 --> 2261.7599999999998
i'm sure you can do it why don't you

2259.2 --> 2264.0
actually then go and demonstrate that

2261.76 --> 2265.28
you can

2264.0 --> 2268.16
present

2265.28 --> 2270.6400000000003
your method of doing that

2268.16 --> 2273.2799999999997
on the flat earth debate just go to

2270.64 --> 2275.92
their discord

2273.28 --> 2275.92
sign in

2276.079 --> 2281.6800000000003
and then speak up

2278.16 --> 2281.68
during the housekeeping question

2282.72 --> 2288.3999999999996
we demonstrate it all the time oh sure

2285.2 --> 2290.56
you do yes yes i'm sure

2288.4 --> 2293.599
it's just a daily occurrence where you

2290.56 --> 2294.72
open up a portal and get a unicorn out

2293.599 --> 2297.119
right

2294.72 --> 2300.9599999999996
i mean it only rests like

2297.119 --> 2303.28
it only lasts for like one round a level

2300.96 --> 2303.28
right

2304.079 --> 2308.96
so it might be there for like 30 seconds

2307.599 --> 2312.8
at best

2308.96 --> 2315.2
but i know you do that every day

2312.8 --> 2317.44
i know you have proof that

2315.2 --> 2319.68
like you can open a portal and like get

2317.44 --> 2320.96
a unicorn out and then have it around

2319.68 --> 2324.0
and

2320.96 --> 2326.7200000000003
make horse sounds and all that and

2324.0 --> 2329.599
give their magical farts and then they

2326.72 --> 2331.7599999999998
go away again i know i know you do that

2329.599 --> 2332.88
every day

2331.76 --> 2338.119
but

2332.88 --> 2338.119
yeah you never really show us you see

2344.88 --> 2349.359
i mean just do it yourself you too can

2347.92 --> 2352.2400000000002
do it on a ball

2349.359 --> 2355.04
yes i'm i'm sure that

2352.24 --> 2358.3999999999996
i don't know if i'd know how

2355.04 --> 2361.92
i too could open up a portal right here

2358.4 --> 2365.839
on camera and get a unicorn out

2361.92 --> 2369.76
i know i could do it if i only knew how

2365.839 --> 2372.0789999999997
so please please tell me how to do that

2369.76 --> 2377.119
right don't just tell me you you just do

2372.079 --> 2377.119
it we do it all the time yeah wow how

2378.0 --> 2382.88
aren't you demonstrated why don't you

2380.24 --> 2385.4399999999996
make a little presentation

2382.88 --> 2388.6400000000003
show us step by step what you do in

2385.44 --> 2390.48
order to accomplish that

2388.64 --> 2392.96
yeah and then

2390.48 --> 2396.0
make that presentation

2392.96 --> 2399.2400000000002
on the flat earth debates

2396.0 --> 2399.24
be great

2416.74 --> 2423.68
[Laughter]

2421.839 --> 2425.359
yes nick rupert

2423.68 --> 2427.2799999999997
yeah

2425.359 --> 2429.92
but

2427.28 --> 2431.92
how can that work though if you're

2429.92 --> 2434.4
if the horizon's geometric and you're

2431.92 --> 2435.44
standing on a ball

2434.4 --> 2438.4
could you

2435.44 --> 2439.52
like show that how that actually works i

2438.4 --> 2443.2000000000003
know

2439.52 --> 2444.319
that you point a sextant to the horizon

2443.2 --> 2445.9199999999996
and then

2444.319 --> 2448.24
to the sun

2445.92 --> 2449.119
and then compare the angles

2448.24 --> 2453.7999999999997
but

2449.119 --> 2453.8
how does that work out on a ball

2459.599 --> 2461.599
right

2460.8 --> 2464.0
because

2461.599 --> 2466.56
the whole issue with an elevation angle

2464.0 --> 2469.92
is that

2466.56 --> 2471.7599999999998
you can't have a uniform elevation angle

2469.92 --> 2472.56
on the globe

2471.76 --> 2475.2000000000003
that

2472.56 --> 2478.2
like defeats the point of an elevation

2475.2 --> 2478.2
angle

2481.04 --> 2487.04
you still need it though for celestial

2483.599 --> 2488.96
navigation so how does that work

2487.04 --> 2493.359
with your sextant

2488.96 --> 2495.839
on an actual globe how do you do that

2493.359 --> 2495.839
why not

2499.92 --> 2504.7200000000003
because an elevation angle

2503.04 --> 2506.16
is based

2504.72 --> 2510.8799999999997
on a plane

2506.16 --> 2513.2
it's a plane it's a uh

2510.88 --> 2515.839
this is getting outside of my geometric

2513.2 --> 2515.839
expertise

2519.119 --> 2522.2400000000002
i would have to like

2520.56 --> 2523.92
go through one of tenth man's

2522.24 --> 2527.359
presentations again and he does it

2523.92 --> 2527.359
pretty much every day so

2528.319 --> 2531.7599999999998
like even as a kid this [ __ ] gave me a

2530.48 --> 2534.0
headache

2531.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
but i did pick up on the details like oh

2534.0 --> 2539.92
star maps they're flat and like parallel

2537.839 --> 2542.72
i was like what

2539.92 --> 2545.119
what the hell

2542.72 --> 2545.1189999999997
okay

2547.119 --> 2551.52
i really didn't i didn't even understand

2549.52 --> 2554.0
like how that makes the earth not a bowl

2551.52 --> 2556.0
i just remember that i was taught that i

2554.0 --> 2558.4
was given this like this little kitty

2556.0 --> 2558.4
course

2558.56 --> 2561.44
by my parents

2562.24 --> 2565.839
when i was like 10 or something

2567.359 --> 2572.64
unfortunately doesn't know what he's

2568.96 --> 2575.52
talking about oh yes yes oh god nick

2572.64 --> 2578.52
robert just get out

2575.52 --> 2578.52
just

2578.8 --> 2581.8390000000004
go

2579.839 --> 2585.52
an fed

2581.839 --> 2585.52
do your little presentation

2586.56 --> 2589.92
don't

2587.599 --> 2591.6800000000003
come in here and talk [ __ ] about people

2589.92 --> 2593.839
that actually know what they're talking

2591.68 --> 2593.839
about

2614.88 --> 2619.599
guys asking for glow proof

2617.44 --> 2622.88
but they keep calling [ __ ] on all of

2619.599 --> 2625.839
it yeah because it is it's fallacious

2622.88 --> 2629.359
the globe proof is fallacious

2625.839 --> 2633.359
it's all presupposed all of it

2629.359 --> 2637.5989999999997
all of the entire globe model is based

2633.359 --> 2639.7599999999998
on the presupposition that it is a globe

2637.599 --> 2642.2400000000002
that's literally the cornerstone of the

2639.76 --> 2646.8390000000004
entire thing

2642.24 --> 2650.56
the cornerstone of the entire model is a

2646.839 --> 2654.0789999999997
conjuration literally

2650.56 --> 2655.839
the entire belief literally conjures the

2654.079 --> 2657.44
globe

2655.839 --> 2660.319
that's what it is

2657.44 --> 2662.2400000000002
there's no evil invocation there right

2660.319 --> 2664.16
because it isn't there it all

2662.24 --> 2667.1189999999997
presupposes

2664.16 --> 2670.0
it's a conjuration

2667.119 --> 2673.2000000000003
right when all of it the entire thing

2670.0 --> 2675.599
the entire universe crystal

2673.2 --> 2678.3999999999996
all the math all of it if it all rests

2675.599 --> 2680.7200000000003
on one singular thing and that is the

2678.4 --> 2683.04
presupposition that it is a globe within

2680.72 --> 2686.0
the argumentation

2683.04 --> 2689.96
then it's one giant conjuration and that

2686.0 --> 2689.96
is what it is it's a dream

2690.8 --> 2697.3590000000004
it's basically a what if story the

2694.24 --> 2700.24
entire globe cosmology all of it

2697.359 --> 2701.04
astronomy astrophysics all of it is all

2700.24 --> 2702.839
a

2701.04 --> 2706.4
what if

2702.839 --> 2707.599
story what if the earth was a glow

2706.4 --> 2709.92
story

2707.599 --> 2712.0
all of it the entire thing

2709.92 --> 2713.599
the entire legacy thousands and

2712.0 --> 2717.28
thousands of

2713.599 --> 2719.28
hundreds of thousands of pages of people

2717.28 --> 2722.1600000000003
giving their opinion

2719.28 --> 2724.8
giving their technical insight

2722.16 --> 2728.48
on what if the earth was a globe that's

2724.8 --> 2730.5600000000004
what it is all of it all of it is that

2728.48 --> 2733.119
it's a giant conjuration based on the

2730.56 --> 2734.96
presupposition that the earth is a globe

2733.119 --> 2739.359
it doesn't demonstrate it it doesn't

2734.96 --> 2739.359
prove it it presupposes it all of it

2742.4 --> 2747.28
every demonstration that claims to be

2744.8 --> 2749.44
approved that the earth is a globe

2747.28 --> 2750.96
presupposes that the earth is a globe

2749.44 --> 2754.0
within it

2750.96 --> 2757.92
the entire thing all of it no exception

2754.0 --> 2760.88
yeah there is no exception to this

2757.92 --> 2764.28
zero exception all of it have it

2760.88 --> 2764.28
all of it

2784.72 --> 2787.72
right

2794.16 --> 2800.04
watch this [ __ ] disappear over the rice

2800.87 --> 2803.909
[Music]

2815.52 --> 2821.68
the ship's zoom lens trick never truly

2819.119 --> 2824.0
works yeah it does

2821.68 --> 2827.1189999999997
it absolutely does

2824.0 --> 2827.119
mandy lifeboats

2828.839 --> 2833.119
right you look at the horizon you don't

2831.68 --> 2836.319
see a ship

2833.119 --> 2838.8
take a camera you zoom in and suddenly

2836.319 --> 2841.2799999999997
you see the ship

2838.8 --> 2842.8390000000004
it's right there

2841.28 --> 2847.6800000000003
now if the

2842.839 --> 2850.4
horizon was a geometric block object

2847.68 --> 2852.319
like the edge of a sphere blocking it

2850.4 --> 2854.6800000000003
that could never happen

2852.319 --> 2857.44
because once something is basically

2854.68 --> 2859.1189999999997
geometrically obstructing something else

2857.44 --> 2862.96
behind it

2859.119 --> 2864.559
it's not gonna come back into focus

2862.96 --> 2867.04
you see

2864.559 --> 2868.96
that doesn't happen

2867.04 --> 2871.119
if it's geometrically blocked it's

2868.96 --> 2873.52
blocked doesn't matter matter how much

2871.119 --> 2875.44
you zoom out you zoom in

2873.52 --> 2878.72
it's blocked because it's physically

2875.44 --> 2880.8
blocking it right the horizon however

2878.72 --> 2882.8799999999997
isn't geometric

2880.8 --> 2887.28
the black swan observations already

2882.88 --> 2891.44
proved that horizon is purely optical

2887.28 --> 2893.599
based on lens and resolution

2891.44 --> 2895.52
it's like that's a complex field within

2893.599 --> 2898.6400000000003
optics so that's what the horizon

2895.52 --> 2899.599
effectively is and that's why

2898.64 --> 2903.04
things

2899.599 --> 2904.2400000000002
seem to disappear into the horizon

2903.04 --> 2906.72
that's what it really looks like it

2904.24 --> 2908.72
doesn't go behind it it disappears into

2906.72 --> 2909.9199999999996
the horizon

2908.72 --> 2911.52
yeah

2909.92 --> 2914.4
well

2911.52 --> 2916.319
you can then zoom in and you and you get

2914.4 --> 2917.839
the full picture again you get to see it

2916.319 --> 2920.319
again right

2917.839 --> 2922.48
that's only possible because it's not a

2920.319 --> 2926.319
geometric horizon

2922.48 --> 2928.8
but an apparent one a visual effect

2926.319 --> 2930.5589999999997
a side effect of optics that's what the

2928.8 --> 2934.0
horizon is

2930.559 --> 2934.0
and it's flat

2935.44 --> 2940.319
it's the flatness of the the surface

2937.92 --> 2943.76
orientation that allows

2940.319 --> 2946.88
the horizon to be like that to be

2943.76 --> 2948.559
things that just appear to fold into it

2946.88 --> 2951.44
and disappear

2948.559 --> 2952.559
so if it was geometric then there would

2951.44 --> 2954.96
be

2952.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
a different effect of the horizon there

2954.96 --> 2960.0
would be a rigid blocking

2957.839 --> 2962.88
no matter how much you zoom in or out

2960.0 --> 2964.8
that amount of rigid blocking would not

2962.88 --> 2966.48
alter

2964.8 --> 2970.559
it would always be

2966.48 --> 2973.44
visual visible in the same amount

2970.559 --> 2976.48
depending on the geometry

2973.44 --> 2978.7200000000003
now that isn't the real case with real

2976.48 --> 2980.4
observations in the real world

2978.72 --> 2982.16
so the horizon definitely isn't

2980.4 --> 2985.28
geometric

2982.16 --> 2987.52
it's optical

2985.28 --> 2990.6400000000003
things disappear into it

2987.52 --> 2993.839
but with another observation medium in

2990.64 --> 2996.72
the same position you can then still

2993.839 --> 2996.72
get to see it

2996.96 --> 3001.599
even though to another

2998.8 --> 3005.44
visual medium it's completely invisible

3001.599 --> 3007.839
it's just disappeared within the horizon

3005.44 --> 3011.319
because it's optical not geometric

3007.839 --> 3011.319
blocking things

3015.56 --> 3018.81
[Music]

3023.93 --> 3027.06
[Music]

3027.52 --> 3029.839
ah

3033.92 --> 3037.119
okay

3035.52 --> 3039.359
guys you want me to

3037.119 --> 3041.6800000000003
kick out bob nodell's gyroscope he seems

3039.359 --> 3045.0789999999997
to be just kind of like useless spamming

3041.68 --> 3045.0789999999997
at this point

3064.319 --> 3074.72
nobody can provide a video for [ __ ] dude

3070.0 --> 3074.72
that's like in every standard video

3075.04 --> 3079.359
what the hell is wrong with you man it's

3077.44 --> 3082.2400000000002
just a lie

3079.359 --> 3083.5989999999997
that's just a straight-faced [ __ ]

3082.24 --> 3086.3999999999996
lie

3083.599 --> 3088.079
only somebody that would literally never

3086.4 --> 3090.7200000000003
click

3088.079 --> 3093.04
a flat earth video

3090.72 --> 3094.839
would think that that might be true what

3093.04 --> 3100.599
you just said there

3094.839 --> 3100.599
pz3 like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

3110.24 --> 3114.9599999999996
show me a video then

3112.96 --> 3117.28
no

3114.96 --> 3121.04
go to eric dubay

3117.28 --> 3122.96
he has videos that are literally titled

3121.04 --> 3124.5589999999997
concerning that

3122.96 --> 3128.16
ships don't

3124.559 --> 3128.1600000000003
go over the horizon

3129.119 --> 3133.359
this is like he's got like i think even

3131.04 --> 3135.44
like 10 second videos about it's just a

3133.359 --> 3137.68
thing that he constantly

3135.44 --> 3141.52
brings back up in his videos which is

3137.68 --> 3141.52
greatly appreciated because it's true

3142.24 --> 3146.319
show me if you go and look for it

3146.64 --> 3151.5989999999997
i'm not going to provide you a full

3149.599 --> 3153.839
library

3151.599 --> 3156.6400000000003
on how to figure out the earth is not a

3153.839 --> 3158.96
ball right here right now you're gonna

3156.64 --> 3161.359
have to go and look out for it unless

3158.96 --> 3164.2400000000002
you literally are just trying to guess

3161.359 --> 3167.2799999999997
like yourself and us

3164.24 --> 3170.16
into no it can't be out there well then

3167.28 --> 3172.48
you're just a [ __ ] that's unwilling to

3170.16 --> 3176.52
actually face the truth

3172.48 --> 3176.52
and you're wasting our time

3190.4 --> 3195.0
yeah

3191.28 --> 3195.0
now [ __ ] off

3198.64 --> 3204.64
you understand anti-flat earthers

3201.28 --> 3204.6400000000003
this is not your show

3205.68 --> 3209.5989999999997
yeah

3207.359 --> 3211.68
i allow people with

3209.599 --> 3213.92
global beliefs

3211.68 --> 3216.5589999999997
reservations

3213.92 --> 3220.64
maybe creative ideas whatever i allow

3216.559 --> 3223.3590000000004
that i am kind of a global fan myself

3220.64 --> 3227.92
what i do not allow though is mentally

3223.359 --> 3227.92
deranged dementia riddled

3228.48 --> 3234.88
idiot anti-flat earthers yeah

3231.68 --> 3237.2799999999997
i don't tolerate that if dementia is all

3234.88 --> 3239.92
you're spreading then you just get the

3237.28 --> 3239.92
[ __ ] out

3240.8 --> 3245.04
don't waste our time don't lower our

3243.119 --> 3247.52
level with your [ __ ] and your

3245.04 --> 3247.52
ignorance

3249.599 --> 3257.52
we're not going to keep explaining

3254.52 --> 3259.119
2015 arguments that are widespread

3257.52 --> 3261.44
widely known

3259.119 --> 3262.319
not gonna keep doing that like you're

3261.44 --> 3264.559
some

3262.319 --> 3266.4
reoccurring amnesia

3264.559 --> 3267.44
idiot

3266.4 --> 3270.4
no

3267.44 --> 3272.96
i'm sorry if you literally do not have a

3270.4 --> 3275.76
memory of any sort and you're constantly

3272.96 --> 3278.16
stuck in this [ __ ] position

3275.76 --> 3280.7990000000004
where you believe it's a globe i'm sorry

3278.16 --> 3283.44
i can't help it that you're a [ __ ]

3280.799 --> 3286.96
demented [ __ ] okay i can't help it

3283.44 --> 3290.2400000000002
it's your own damn problem

3286.96 --> 3292.559
i'm not gonna try to snap you out of

3290.24 --> 3294.9599999999996
something when you don't even have a

3292.559 --> 3298.1600000000003
basic memory function

3294.96 --> 3300.7200000000003
just get the [ __ ] out

3298.16 --> 3305.0
seek some help elsewhere and stop

3300.72 --> 3305.0
nagging us with your dementia

3326.96 --> 3330.92
right

3327.92 --> 3330.92
anyway

3341.359 --> 3344.359
ah

3350.48 --> 3354.2400000000002
no

3352.4 --> 3356.64
why just get so triggered what do you

3354.24 --> 3359.359
mean triggered

3356.64 --> 3362.96
i'm not triggered

3359.359 --> 3366.16
dude i'm super relaxed

3362.96 --> 3367.76
you don't know what trigger it is

3366.16 --> 3370.3999999999996
you don't know what i'm like when i'm

3367.76 --> 3372.96
triggered apparently i mean you must

3370.4 --> 3374.88
have just shown up like a complete

3372.96 --> 3378.48
deranged idiot

3374.88 --> 3381.599
has never seen me before in his life

3378.48 --> 3381.599
her life whatever

3382.24 --> 3386.72
i think that that's triggered

3384.559 --> 3386.7200000000003
no

3386.96 --> 3394.0
if somebody is just a disruptive idiot

3389.92 --> 3396.319
in my class i eventually kick them out

3394.0 --> 3400.0
because they're distracting everybody

3396.319 --> 3400.0
with pointless [ __ ]

3400.119 --> 3404.7200000000003
regurgitating

3401.839 --> 3406.799
endlessly debunked arguments over and

3404.72 --> 3408.799
over again

3406.799 --> 3412.24
and then expecting more than just an

3408.799 --> 3416.079
auditory explanation it is just no

3412.24 --> 3418.5589999999997
we're not some like wizards to entertain

3416.079 --> 3421.8390000000004
you with your stupid little

3418.559 --> 3424.2400000000002
dementia dreams i'm sorry

3421.839 --> 3428.0
we're not here to help you

3424.24 --> 3430.16
you can just get the [ __ ] out

3428.0 --> 3431.119
go wallow in your delusion somewhere

3430.16 --> 3433.839
else

3431.119 --> 3433.839
you're not welcome

3433.92 --> 3439.839
now if you actually got an argument

3436.319 --> 3442.4
you can be honest about what

3439.839 --> 3444.0
what's out there what's really out there

3442.4 --> 3446.0
because you explored and you can

3444.0 --> 3448.16
remember it and you're not like

3446.0 --> 3451.44
politically obsessed with your globe

3448.16 --> 3453.5989999999997
belief being reinforced

3451.44 --> 3456.599
well yeah then you then we can have a

3453.599 --> 3456.599
conversation

3461.2 --> 3466.3999999999996
but this is not the place to just

3463.839 --> 3468.72
regurgitate your dementia

3466.4 --> 3468.7200000000003
okay

3469.52 --> 3474.96
you might want to seek out some like

3472.559 --> 3476.48
mental health care professionals they do

3474.96 --> 3478.079
that right

3476.48 --> 3480.559
they're the ones that are like okay

3478.079 --> 3483.599
what's on your mind today

3480.559 --> 3484.88
the boats go over horizon

3483.599 --> 3487.28
yeah

3484.88 --> 3488.559
they'll be like oh oh yes yes i've heard

3487.28 --> 3489.76
that before

3488.559 --> 3492.2400000000002
yes

3489.76 --> 3495.44
keep talking

3492.24 --> 3497.839
yeah go go there do that

3495.44 --> 3502.48
don't do that here yeah

3497.839 --> 3504.88
unless you like put down the big bucks

3502.48 --> 3504.88
get it

3506.0 --> 3510.559
i'm not gonna play

3508.319 --> 3513.68
a psychiatrist

3510.559 --> 3518.079
or a psychologist to somebody that like

3513.68 --> 3522.16
clearly has hostile intent towards me

3518.079 --> 3522.1600000000003
directly or indirectly yeah

3522.24 --> 3528.0789999999997
unless you like prove your loyalty

3525.839 --> 3530.799
and your personal investment because a

3528.079 --> 3534.0
personal investment like money

3530.799 --> 3536.4
well it will actually make you want to

3534.0 --> 3537.839
pull through with what you're

3536.4 --> 3539.28
coming to do

3537.839 --> 3541.52
you see

3539.28 --> 3543.2000000000003
you can't just walk away forget about it

3541.52 --> 3545.92
all again and do it over again

3543.2 --> 3549.04
immediately within 10 minutes

3545.92 --> 3553.839
yeah so pay money

3549.04 --> 3555.2799999999997
put it down in my paypal in for me

3553.839 --> 3557.599
i will

3555.28 --> 3562.76
shout you out for that and and then we

3557.599 --> 3562.76
can entertain your dementia for a bit

3573.839 --> 3577.44
yeah it's gonna require some personal

3575.52 --> 3580.079
investment because it's very tedious

3577.44 --> 3582.559
it's tedious for me dealing with people

3580.079 --> 3582.559
like you

3582.96 --> 3587.359
i don't enjoy

3584.839 --> 3589.839
it i mean i know that some of the

3587.359 --> 3592.72
viewers enjoyed when i get like rage win

3589.839 --> 3596.0789999999997
on on your ass

3592.72 --> 3598.24
or get a little creative with my

3596.079 --> 3601.04
analysis

3598.24 --> 3603.7599999999998
i know you guys appreciate that

3601.04 --> 3607.2
but i personally don't enjoy it i do

3603.76 --> 3610.1600000000003
that kind of out of defense

3607.2 --> 3612.799
i don't enjoy dealing with these people

3610.16 --> 3615.44
to be fair i wish none of them ever

3612.799 --> 3617.599
existed i wish they would literally just

3615.44 --> 3617.599
be

3618.52 --> 3622.4
disintegrated into nothing

3622.48 --> 3627.119
like

3623.68 --> 3627.1189999999997
infinity gauntlet [ __ ]

3627.28 --> 3630.96
right

3628.96 --> 3633.119
i i really kind of do

3630.96 --> 3635.76
but then again

3633.119 --> 3638.48
i also realized that they're still there

3635.76 --> 3640.88
probably with a purpose

3638.48 --> 3644.4
designated by god like all the that are

3640.88 --> 3646.799
cursed that are lost

3644.4 --> 3649.839
are still guided by god

3646.799 --> 3651.92
they're tortured by them too

3649.839 --> 3653.52
because of their own sins and their own

3651.92 --> 3655.04
stupidity

3653.52 --> 3657.28
but

3655.04 --> 3659.839
they still serve upon function because

3657.28 --> 3662.079
everything serves a function of some

3659.839 --> 3665.52
sort everything there's always something

3662.079 --> 3665.52
that you can do with everything

3666.4 --> 3671.52
right god does not

3668.799 --> 3673.28
leave things to chance

3671.52 --> 3674.4
at all

3673.28 --> 3676.559
like

3674.4 --> 3679.04
not even close anyway

3676.559 --> 3681.28
it's just up for us to figure out like

3679.04 --> 3683.359
just like every mistake you make you can

3681.28 --> 3684.88
you just hammer yourself on the head all

3683.359 --> 3686.319
your life about it or you could

3684.88 --> 3688.96
literally like

3686.319 --> 3691.04
what can i learn out of this

3688.96 --> 3694.079
that i would not have been able to learn

3691.04 --> 3698.079
if i hadn't made that mistake

3694.079 --> 3700.1600000000003
that's depend that's the penance

3698.079 --> 3702.559
that's the real penance and their growth

3700.16 --> 3706.48
comes out of it

3702.559 --> 3706.48
and then you become a better person

3706.64 --> 3712.4
but it requires that dedication and that

3709.599 --> 3714.96
focus in that realization like you have

3712.4 --> 3717.039
to learn from it you don't learn from it

3714.96 --> 3719.28
it's nothing but something being taken

3717.039 --> 3721.119
away from you

3719.28 --> 3723.599
anyway thank you flatter sage for the

3721.119 --> 3726.599
paypal i will i will check it out right

3723.599 --> 3726.599

3734.319 --> 3737.48

dude

3801.28 --> 3804.88
freaking paypal dude

3807.52 --> 3812.48
well that was pointless ah so you just

3810.799 --> 3814.319
have to refresh and then i didn't have

3812.48 --> 3815.92
to do that it's like what's the point of

3814.319 --> 3817.52
that

3815.92 --> 3818.64
anyway

3817.52 --> 3820.88
thank you

3818.64 --> 3823.0389999999998
for the paypal donation

3820.88 --> 3826.319
letter sage thanks for the continuing

3823.039 --> 3828.88

3826.319 --> 3831.2
in these last few months thank you so

3828.88 --> 3831.2000000000003
much

3831.28 --> 3836.76
i

3832.0 --> 3836.76
really really appreciate that

3845.839 --> 3851.64
it's listening to awakes oh dude

3848.319 --> 3851.64
dude white

3853.28 --> 3856.799
talk about siemens transition like

3854.96 --> 3859.68
hyperspace in the old video game

3856.799 --> 3859.68
asteroids right

3859.92 --> 3865.76
yeah that's so funny about awake souls

3862.48 --> 3868.48
is that he actually like has the

3865.76 --> 3870.88
the internal visual ability to actually

3868.48 --> 3873.039
get that concept of looping

3870.88 --> 3875.44
he's like one of the few people that

3873.039 --> 3876.6400000000003
outside of myself actually talks about

3875.44 --> 3879.359
that

3876.64 --> 3882.48
he also talks about a whole bunch of

3879.359 --> 3885.0389999999998
super super supportive crazy [ __ ] and

3882.48 --> 3886.48
fear porn but

3885.039 --> 3888.7200000000003
yeah

3886.48 --> 3890.96
it's the one thing about him that

3888.72 --> 3894.2799999999997
actually

3890.96 --> 3894.28
was interesting

3894.48 --> 3900.0
i just wish he wasn't such a crazy

3896.64 --> 3900.0
person on top of that

3901.2 --> 3906.0789999999997
also he's openly gay

3903.359 --> 3906.0789999999997
just gross

3907.68 --> 3911.7599999999998
hey dan winfield yeah did you guys know

3909.92 --> 3915.039
by the way i actually did a hangout with

3911.76 --> 3917.44
him it's like in my flat earth talks is

3915.039 --> 3919.039
like the eighth or tenth show or

3917.44 --> 3921.76
something

3919.039 --> 3923.6800000000003
so i actually was on with awake souls

3921.76 --> 3925.5200000000004
and i i didn't know him back then i

3923.68 --> 3927.0389999999998
thought i was actually kind of a cool

3925.52 --> 3929.599
guy and smart

3927.039 --> 3931.92
and then halfway the actual show i

3929.599 --> 3933.839
figured out that he's kind of deranged i

3931.92 --> 3936.079
didn't know that when i started the show

3933.839 --> 3938.72
with him

3936.079 --> 3938.7200000000003
it's weird

3941.119 --> 3945.52
very old indeed dan winfield yeah dan

3943.92 --> 3948.079
winfield here

3945.52 --> 3951.079

3980.24 --> 3985.2
that that one video no it's always been

3982.96 --> 3985.2

4060.72 --> 4063.79
[Music]

4073.359 --> 4079.92
want to see some old fe videos

4076.88 --> 4082.48
yeah also because in that time i i

4079.92 --> 4083.28
wouldn't go crazy yet

4082.48 --> 4085.839
like

4083.28 --> 4088.88
i was dealing with like massive amount

4085.839 --> 4090.799
of stress from my visions and [ __ ] that

4088.88 --> 4092.48
were literally like the door had just

4090.799 --> 4094.079
opened and i was like

4092.48 --> 4096.64
help me

4094.079 --> 4098.719
there's this nightmare staring me in the

4096.64 --> 4101.4400000000005
face and i need to talk about it but

4098.719 --> 4102.2390000000005
it's crazy and it's like really vicious

4101.44 --> 4103.759
and

4102.239 --> 4105.599999999999
help

4103.759 --> 4106.799
but i couldn't talk about it right i

4105.6 --> 4108.159000000001
just couldn't

4106.799 --> 4110.319
barely

4108.159 --> 4112.159
i was scared of it i was scared to like

4110.319 --> 4114.0
reveal it like

4112.159 --> 4116.5599999999995
that something would come after me or

4114.0 --> 4119.199
something really

4116.56 --> 4122.0
i had a lot of paranoia issues so in the

4119.199 --> 4124.0
flatter talks days i was very reserved i

4122.0 --> 4126.159
of course didn't have to like

4124.0 --> 4129.279
or yeah i didn't by my own standards

4126.159 --> 4132.0
have to do it and an everyday show

4129.279 --> 4133.92
so i did i do like every tuesday or

4132.0 --> 4135.359
something i did a show

4133.92 --> 4138.159
sometimes

4135.359 --> 4142.64
in with other people

4138.159 --> 4142.639999999999
on other shows in the weekends and such

4143.359 --> 4148.159000000001
but i i yeah i would never then have

4145.839 --> 4150.159
like crazy outbursts

4148.159 --> 4151.199
as kind of started to happen during the

4150.159 --> 4153.44
flat earth

4151.199 --> 4157.44
early bird show

4153.44 --> 4157.44
when i was doing an everyday show

4159.679 --> 4164.56
so i still had a lot of that

4162.4 --> 4166.5599999999995
suppressed and you could probably see

4164.56 --> 4168.719
that i mean i might have had a little

4166.56 --> 4170.0
bit of a crazy glimmer in my eye every

4168.719 --> 4171.839
now and then

4170.0 --> 4173.6
in the flatter talk shows i don't

4171.839 --> 4175.679
remember i really would have to watch

4173.6 --> 4177.92
back

4175.679 --> 4181.04
but just remember

4177.92 --> 4183.12
i don't that i was getting overwhelmed

4181.04 --> 4185.839
by my visions

4183.12 --> 4187.679
that had kind of just returned they just

4185.839 --> 4189.5199999999995
knocked on my door

4187.679 --> 4191.4400000000005
of my mind

4189.52 --> 4193.839000000001
just started to remember it in a big

4191.44 --> 4193.839
picture

4194.56 --> 4199.8
and that was quite a burden on me

4196.8 --> 4199.8
psychologically

4213.199 --> 4217.839999999999
the big and what the hell are you

4214.64 --> 4217.84
talking about

4227.52 --> 4231.1990000000005
then when do you remember in our

4229.36 --> 4233.199
conversations that i would be talking

4231.199 --> 4236.08
about my visions and stuff do you

4233.199 --> 4236.08
remember any of that

4237.28 --> 4240.8
because

4238.239 --> 4243.12
when i wasn't like being recorded i

4240.8 --> 4246.159000000001
would pretty much try to talk to

4243.12 --> 4246.159
everybody about it

4249.44 --> 4254.159
i still remember having this skype

4251.679 --> 4256.8
conversation with mark sargent

4254.159 --> 4259.12
and literally going like full blast

4256.8 --> 4260.719
manic about and just like dude look at

4259.12 --> 4263.84
this

4260.719 --> 4265.84
like a complete the like crazy person

4263.84 --> 4267.92
but i knew that

4265.84 --> 4269.4400000000005
he was getting that sort of [ __ ] all the

4267.92 --> 4271.4400000000005
time

4269.44 --> 4273.759999999999
so i kind of like

4271.44 --> 4275.12
just like i knew he could take it and i

4273.76 --> 4278.56
was hoping like

4275.12 --> 4278.5599999999995
can you see this

4279.04 --> 4284.88
laying out like ah this is like a giant

4282.4 --> 4286.5599999999995
death star-sized ship

4284.88 --> 4288.8
powered by

4286.56 --> 4291.52
lit by buddhists that are literally

4288.8 --> 4293.84
meditating it into a floating state

4291.52 --> 4296.080000000001
arriving in a giant desert and then

4293.84 --> 4298.96
opening up and all kinds of

4296.08 --> 4300.4
like weird people and it's probably in

4298.96 --> 4303.92
the future

4300.4 --> 4303.92
i think i told him that story

4308.88 --> 4312.08
because yeah i did actually see that one

4310.96 --> 4314.8
time

4312.08 --> 4317.199
in the vision i've seen like i've seen

4314.8 --> 4319.52
dark [ __ ] but i've also seen like just

4317.199 --> 4321.36
incredible

4319.52 --> 4323.84
surreal stuff

4321.36 --> 4324.96
that just kind of seemed like it could

4323.84 --> 4329.400000000001
be real

4324.96 --> 4329.4
it's just like mind boggling

4330.88 --> 4333.28
anyway

4336.8 --> 4343.56
right yeah then winfield

4339.52 --> 4343.56
where did everybody else go

4351.679 --> 4358.56
right yeah but anyway i i have started

4354.719 --> 4358.56
to talk about it publicly now

4359.92 --> 4363.52
and i just kind of

4361.52 --> 4367.360000000001
filter out

4363.52 --> 4367.360000000001
like the worst parts of it

4367.76 --> 4373.4400000000005
because i don't think anybody should

4369.36 --> 4373.44
ever talk about such things in public

4382.96 --> 4389.28
just letting you guys catch up

4386.08 --> 4389.28
all right now that's okay

4389.84 --> 4394.159000000001
i mean i've i've seen dan winfield

4392.8 --> 4396.320000000001
around

4394.159 --> 4397.5199999999995
like i think he also said hello like

4396.32 --> 4399.92
what is it

4397.52 --> 4403.6
two months ago or something

4399.92 --> 4403.6
so just i'm glad he's still around

4405.04 --> 4409.88
he's a really nice guy from england

4419.52 --> 4423.88
oh goody it's a kumu virus

4439.84 --> 4446.159000000001
you're late okay jeff gas head

4442.88 --> 4446.159000000001
oh you missed quite a show

4451.04 --> 4457.199
yeah akuma virus dude you yesterday on

4454.56 --> 4459.92
the letter debate because the kuma fires

4457.199 --> 4459.919999999999

4460.56 --> 4466.320000000001
dude you were just

4462.719 --> 4469.36
dude you were rumpus level [ __ ]

4466.32 --> 4471.36
i mean you were just straight lying

4469.36 --> 4473.679
through your teeth it was really

4471.36 --> 4475.92
terrible akumavirus the way you

4473.679 --> 4478.0
composed yourself yesterday that was

4475.92 --> 4479.6
terrible

4478.0 --> 4484.96
i mean

4479.6 --> 4484.96
never go full brenda okay never do that

4485.92 --> 4489.679
it's really unhealthy for you

4488.56 --> 4492.159000000001
like

4489.679 --> 4494.88
whatever cohesion you think you may

4492.159 --> 4496.879999999999
still have within your character if you

4494.88 --> 4499.52
keep doing that

4496.88 --> 4502.0
you will you will lose that last little

4499.52 --> 4502.88
bit as well okay you don't want to do

4502.0 --> 4507.88
that

4502.88 --> 4507.88
you want to remain a human being

4512.56 --> 4517.1990000000005
for some reason they thought i needed to

4514.32 --> 4518.639999999999
define coriolis yeah but you literally

4517.199 --> 4522.32
lied

4518.64 --> 4522.320000000001
you lied about what you said

4523.44 --> 4527.48
it come on

4554.8 --> 4559.1990000000005
i'm just going to ask do you know what a

4556.64 --> 4561.6
dingle berry is

4559.199 --> 4563.5199999999995
well dingleberry i don't know

4563.52 --> 4566.569
[Music]

4572.64 --> 4577.92
a foolish or inept person that's

4575.28 --> 4578.96
hilarious i didn't

4577.92 --> 4581.679
no

4578.96 --> 4584.0
it was actually

4581.679 --> 4584.0
wow

4584.88 --> 4589.92
damn i didn't that dingleberry is a

4587.6 --> 4591.76
foolish or a napped person

4589.92 --> 4594.76
apparently

4591.76 --> 4594.76
huh

4595.77 --> 4601.6
[Music]

4597.36 --> 4601.599999999999
but it's also a fruit let's see

4603.6 --> 4606.6
right

4610.239 --> 4614.0
i guess it's like typical woods

4612.88 --> 4615.76
fruit like

4614.0 --> 4618.0
wild

4615.76 --> 4618.0
like

4618.239 --> 4623.919999999999
brambles strawberries

4620.88 --> 4625.52
red berries blueberries

4623.92 --> 4628.32
i think those fall under the

4625.52 --> 4628.320000000001
dingleberries

4634.0 --> 4639.52
i'm not entirely sure

4636.88 --> 4642.0
i don't think it's a gross thing

4639.52 --> 4644.2390000000005
oh my lord what what are you talking

4642.0 --> 4644.239
about

4646.48 --> 4650.678999999999
it's a real thing dude

4663.199 --> 4668.239
cut do i don't know what the hell kind

4665.44 --> 4670.719
of language you're into

4668.239 --> 4673.28
maybe to the gays that's what that is

4670.719 --> 4674.88
right because every single word that was

4673.28 --> 4677.199
ever made

4674.88 --> 4679.76
you can have some kind of a gay gross

4677.199 --> 4682.239
reference of that yeah

4679.76 --> 4683.6
it didn't come up in the google search

4682.239 --> 4685.44
okay

4683.6 --> 4689.280000000001
didn't

4685.44 --> 4691.36
that's not what it said at all so

4689.28 --> 4694.159
don't know where you're getting your

4691.36 --> 4694.159
language from

4696.88 --> 4702.679
no it's it's

4699.199 --> 4702.678999999999
urban dictionary

4710.239 --> 4715.44
all right well yeah that's

4712.239 --> 4717.36
gross urban dictionary

4715.44 --> 4721.159
but that's not the definition that i'm

4717.36 --> 4721.159
using so

4726.8 --> 4731.320000000001
slang for the win no

4743.6 --> 4748.320000000001
okay well maybe i should just call it

4746.08 --> 4749.5199999999995
the show dingleberry earth picking

4748.32 --> 4752.159
because i guess

4749.52 --> 4752.159000000001
i don't want to

4754.159 --> 4760.12
conjure or invoke gross

4757.12 --> 4760.12
imagination

4764.159 --> 4770.159
and it is kind of it was referencing to

4766.64 --> 4770.159000000001
the dingleberry earth so

4770.64 --> 4774.320000000001
i guess thank you for the heads up

4774.96 --> 4778.4
one more thing i didn't really want to

4776.8 --> 4781.8
know but

4778.4 --> 4781.799999999999
now i do

4790.0 --> 4795.939
okay

4792.86 --> 4795.938999999999
[Music]

4830.719 --> 4835.04
right but anyway i don't like to think

4832.719 --> 4837.44
about that at all so i'm just going to

4835.04 --> 4838.56
wipe that from my mind again

4837.44 --> 4841.678999999999
yeah

4838.56 --> 4844.4800000000005
i i don't want like

4841.679 --> 4847.4400000000005
a full-fledged dictionary in my head

4844.48 --> 4849.678999999999
filled with like a thousand metaphors

4847.44 --> 4853.12
referencing to literal

4849.679 --> 4854.639
fishy somehow like i don't give a [ __ ]

4853.12 --> 4855.76
quite literally

4854.639 --> 4858.84
yeah

4855.76 --> 4863.1990000000005
i'm just gonna go with a berry an actual

4858.84 --> 4863.1990000000005
berry going to shut up

4866.4 --> 4870.48
damn it

4868.239 --> 4875.199
this is terrible

4870.48 --> 4878.159
oh and my camera froze of course yeah

4875.199 --> 4878.159
of course it did

4878.48 --> 4881.919999999999
i mean

4879.6 --> 4883.679
why not right

4881.92 --> 4886.92
why wouldn't you freeze right there

4883.679 --> 4886.92
right then

4902.16 --> 4905.71
[Music]

4908.08 --> 4912.4
please don't call my show that

4910.639 --> 4914.639
what do you mean it's called the season

4912.4 --> 4916.799999999999
of dingleberry earth picking

4914.639 --> 4919.679
and it's referencing to my explanation

4916.8 --> 4921.12
earlier of how the trolls

4919.679 --> 4922.639
get in

4921.12 --> 4925.28
and then

4922.639 --> 4927.4400000000005
or yeah anti-flood earth is how they

4925.28 --> 4929.36
basically get into these hostile woods

4927.44 --> 4933.04
which is known as flat earthers and then

4929.36 --> 4935.28
try to make them accidentally

4933.04 --> 4937.12
presuppose the ball earth with whatever

4935.28 --> 4939.599999999999
they're talking and then they pick that

4937.12 --> 4941.5199999999995
like a dingleberry it's like oh it's the

4939.6 --> 4945.4400000000005
precious

4941.52 --> 4949.1990000000005
concentrate of a flat earther

4945.44 --> 4951.44
sort of admitting the ball earth right

4949.199 --> 4953.599999999999
invoking it and that's like a precious

4951.44 --> 4955.44
good to them that's like precious energy

4953.6 --> 4958.2390000000005
so they go out

4955.44 --> 4959.759999999999
picking dangleberry earths

4958.239 --> 4962.48
like that

4959.76 --> 4965.52
that's what it's referencing to not this

4962.48 --> 4968.5199999999995
[ __ ] joe

4965.52 --> 4968.52
thing

oh

4980.4 --> 4986.28
hello it's taking star wars oh

4982.96 --> 4986.28

4989.84 --> 4993.28
festival good and you it is the place

4992.239 --> 4995.599999999999
for that

4993.28 --> 4998.599999999999
absolutely

4995.6 --> 4998.6
cool

5000.05 --> 5003.04
[Music]

5001.44 --> 5005.04
i'm glad you were

5003.04 --> 5009.719
you sell a bunch of

5005.04 --> 5009.719
of your tarot decks that's cool

5014.239 --> 5019.199
i'd actually kind of like one myself

5016.32 --> 5021.5199999999995
seeing star wars

5019.199 --> 5021.5199999999995
i mean

5021.679 --> 5027.76
i would i would like it for my uh yeah

5025.52 --> 5029.84
for my stepmom because she's really into

5027.76 --> 5033.1990000000005
that sort of thing

5029.84 --> 5033.1990000000005
she basically collects it

5035.199 --> 5039.44
who's the most aggravating anti-flat

5037.12 --> 5041.28
earther you can think of

5039.44 --> 5043.839999999999
brenda

5041.28 --> 5043.84
by far

5046.719 --> 5053.84
i mean did you listen to brenda on jim

5050.239 --> 5057.5599999999995
bob like the second time

5053.84 --> 5057.56
she's just

5061.04 --> 5064.159
she's like

5062.32 --> 5068.239
fanatically

5064.159 --> 5071.679
reversed world like fanatical about

5068.239 --> 5073.839999999999
opposing every foundation

5071.679 --> 5076.159
like opposing it on purpose and and

5073.84 --> 5080.159000000001
being almost good at it

5076.159 --> 5081.759999999999
yeah fanatically reversed world

5080.159 --> 5084.239
there's not a lot of

5081.76 --> 5089.719
anti-flat earth there's surpass her in

5084.239 --> 5089.718999999999
that level of like devious insanity

5104.0 --> 5107.679
this

5105.28 --> 5109.84
right gorzilla yeah yeah the amount you

5107.679 --> 5112.4800000000005
can literally write a book just about

5109.84 --> 5115.6
all the crazy things that she said you

5112.48 --> 5115.599999999999
could fill a book with that

5117.36 --> 5122.08
brenderp indeed let's go brenda

5125.6 --> 5130.719
i mean i've argued that maybe brenda is

5128.48 --> 5131.678999999999
actually

5130.719 --> 5134.0
like

5131.679 --> 5134.0
uh

5135.36 --> 5140.799999999999
don pettit's wife

5138.239 --> 5143.199
and gatekeeper like brenda

5140.8 --> 5144.88
maybe brenda is like secretly don

5143.199 --> 5147.44
pettit's wife

5144.88 --> 5150.400000000001
and literally brainwashing him to keep

5147.44 --> 5152.879999999999
him believing everything and staying

5150.4 --> 5155.28
like a [ __ ] just completely making him

5152.88 --> 5159.679
last and that would explain

5155.28 --> 5159.679
why don pettit is the way he is

5160.8 --> 5164.8
right

5161.679 --> 5164.8
it only makes sense

5165.6 --> 5169.84
if brenda would be don pettit's wife

5171.28 --> 5175.5199999999995
because he's

5172.48 --> 5176.638999999999
like she's the only one that's truly

5175.52 --> 5179.1990000000005
like

5176.639 --> 5181.76
crazy enough and fanatical enough with

5179.199 --> 5184.48
the reversed world [ __ ] to actually keep

5181.76 --> 5187.4400000000005
don pettit brainwashed and [ __ ]

5184.48 --> 5190.48
i mean nobody is like that naturally

5187.44 --> 5193.678999999999
nobody's that stupid naturally like don

5190.48 --> 5196.239
pettit that's just impossible

5193.679 --> 5198.8
somebody has to keep them that stupid

5196.239 --> 5202.159
and i think brenda is exactly the person

5198.8 --> 5202.159000000001
that would be able to do that

5209.44 --> 5213.5199999999995
cross

5210.48 --> 5216.239
she is done no no they don't have the

5213.52 --> 5216.2390000000005
same voice

5217.92 --> 5222.719
brenda has a completely different type

5220.159 --> 5226.719
of voice very controlled

5222.719 --> 5226.719
don it as kind of a feeble voice

5234.88 --> 5240.159000000001
i mean brenda has more

5236.8 --> 5241.4400000000005
as a voice that's more close to like

5240.159 --> 5245.12
uh

5241.44 --> 5247.759999999999
matt from quantum of conscious

5245.12 --> 5251.12
right they have kind of a similar

5247.76 --> 5253.84
vocal cord system i think

5251.12 --> 5256.4
but brenda is much more cold and just

5253.84 --> 5260.08
like robotic

5256.4 --> 5260.08
when she applies her voice

5261.36 --> 5264.0
and matt from quantum conscience is much

5263.28 --> 5267.0
more

5264.0 --> 5267.0
natural

5283.12 --> 5289.12
what happens when you get a leak

5285.679 --> 5289.12
well then you have a leak

5291.36 --> 5296.5599999999995
he was just taking a piss out of you

5293.679 --> 5296.56
when he said that

5306.719 --> 5311.639
talking by which we'll be back in two

5308.639 --> 5311.639
minutes

5398.159 --> 5401.159
hmm

5422.8 --> 5428.8
what no flatter sage

5425.44 --> 5431.5199999999995
now brenda is not actually stupid she's

5428.8 --> 5434.320000000001
just really deranged

5431.52 --> 5435.76
i think she's like emotionally very

5434.32 --> 5438.96
damaged

5435.76 --> 5442.8
but she is actually kind of smart

5438.96 --> 5445.6
in a sort of autistic way

5442.8 --> 5447.679
right but she is like completely

5445.6 --> 5450.0
detached

5447.679 --> 5451.12
from reality that doesn't make her

5450.0 --> 5454.8
stupid

5451.12 --> 5457.04
it just makes her really delusional

5454.8 --> 5459.84
but she actually does have like

5457.04 --> 5463.199
reasoning capabilities she is very

5459.84 --> 5465.52
observant observant right

5463.199 --> 5468.96
she does have observation skills she's

5465.52 --> 5470.639
just really deranged as in like on

5468.96 --> 5473.84
purpose

5470.639 --> 5475.36
just denying foundations of logic and

5473.84 --> 5478.96
anything

5475.36 --> 5478.96
right that's what she does

5479.84 --> 5483.679
but she's not

5482.239 --> 5487.718999999999
dumb

5483.679 --> 5487.719
she's just really deranged

5491.6 --> 5496.320000000001
and akuma virus is definitely not

5494.159 --> 5499.199
smarter than brenda

5496.32 --> 5502.0
yeah akuma virus

5499.199 --> 5505.04
no no you're not you're actually a kuma

5502.0 --> 5507.199
virus is actually dumb

5505.04 --> 5509.28
he's pretty damn dumb

5507.199 --> 5513.12
you learn a couple of tricks

5509.28 --> 5515.759999999999
but he's not dynamic about it at all

5513.12 --> 5518.5599999999995
yeah akuma virus you're not dynamic in

5515.76 --> 5520.56
your thinking you are actually dumb

5518.56 --> 5522.400000000001
that's okay

5520.56 --> 5525.280000000001
you can do still a little bit of techno

5522.4 --> 5529.04
babble juggling whenever it suits you

5525.28 --> 5529.04
but you are freaking dumb

5529.28 --> 5534.0
that's it a great opinion yeah it's also

5531.6 --> 5536.159000000001
technically true

5534.0 --> 5537.44
go ask rest ahead how he thinks about

5536.159 --> 5539.679
you

5537.44 --> 5539.678999999999
yeah

5540.159 --> 5544.96
you are technically dumb

5542.4 --> 5547.28
akuma virus you're not as smart as you

5544.96 --> 5549.43
feel you are

5547.28 --> 5550.8
you probably have more

5549.43 --> 5553.84
[Music]

5550.8 --> 5556.88
range within your social

5553.84 --> 5558.8
senses and your way of social dealing

5556.88 --> 5560.8
going about you're probably

5558.8 --> 5563.1990000000005
halfway sociable

5560.8 --> 5564.96
but like when it comes to mechanics no

5563.199 --> 5566.48
you are not smart

5564.96 --> 5568.4800000000005
you aren't

5566.48 --> 5570.48
compared to everybody else you're not

5568.48 --> 5573.12
smart

5570.48 --> 5574.718999999999
but what you got you do know something

5573.12 --> 5576.639
you can do with that

5574.719 --> 5578.88
but when you're like

5576.639 --> 5580.8
pushed pushed

5578.88 --> 5585.4400000000005
really put to the test no you're really

5580.8 --> 5585.4400000000005
not that smart dude i'm sorry you're not

5586.639 --> 5593.52
brenda kind of is

5588.4 --> 5597.879999999999
she's just really really deranged

5593.52 --> 5597.88
like seriously lost person

5607.36 --> 5610.88
it's good when flat earthers call you

5609.12 --> 5612.159
dumb

5610.88 --> 5615.56
no

5612.159 --> 5615.5599999999995
no it's not

5617.44 --> 5623.36
now but you have to realize there's a

5619.36 --> 5625.36
difference between delusional and dumb

5623.36 --> 5628.839999999999
dumb

5625.36 --> 5631.839999999999
basically signifies a lack of

5628.84 --> 5634.2390000000005
dynamics you don't know what to do with

5631.84 --> 5637.76
the information as much

5634.239 --> 5637.759999999999
to somebody that's really smart

5638.08 --> 5642.48
and now of course like

5640.239 --> 5644.879999999999
there's another factor and that is

5642.48 --> 5646.959999999999
what are you actually doing with the

5644.88 --> 5649.679
range of information you have available

5646.96 --> 5651.679
that determines how delusional you are

5649.679 --> 5653.76
or how

5651.679 --> 5655.84
sensible you are

5653.76 --> 5656.8
right

5655.84 --> 5660.08
that's

5656.8 --> 5660.08
both are factors

5660.32 --> 5667.04
you're delusional akuma virus but you're

5663.04 --> 5668.88
not the worst of them right you still

5667.04 --> 5670.56
kind of still know what it is to be

5668.88 --> 5673.36
human

5670.56 --> 5676.0
you haven't detached yourself from that

5673.36 --> 5677.199
as much like randa did just completely

5676.0 --> 5679.84
detached

5677.199 --> 5679.839999999999
completely

5682.08 --> 5687.84
but yeah you don't have that much

5683.679 --> 5690.56
dynamic you're not really that smart

5687.84 --> 5690.56
you're kind of dumb

5691.04 --> 5696.32
compared to other anti-flat earthers and

5693.84 --> 5698.96
all that that we deal with you're not

5696.32 --> 5701.679
you're not smart

5698.96 --> 5705.119
has nothing to do with a flat earther

5701.679 --> 5708.0
like calling a baller stupid no this is

5705.119 --> 5710.159
a technical analysis i'm being very

5708.0 --> 5714.199
serious

5710.159 --> 5714.199
never show your full intelligence

5714.8 --> 5718.1990000000005
yeah right

5741.679 --> 5745.6
because i don't have to shut up you're

5744.48 --> 5749.119
lying

5745.6 --> 5749.119000000001
hey you know you're lying

5749.92 --> 5752.84
you literally

5751.76 --> 5756.4800000000005
say come

5752.84 --> 5758.719
self-conflicting things

5756.48 --> 5761.44
like in the singular sentence you've

5758.719 --> 5763.36
been caught many times and you're lying

5761.44 --> 5766.159
about what you said

5763.36 --> 5768.799999999999
you literally say no i didn't say that

5766.159 --> 5771.44
and where you forbade and say what you

5768.8 --> 5775.04
supposedly didn't say when you literally

5771.44 --> 5777.599999999999
on record on audio record literally did

5775.04 --> 5777.6
say that

5777.92 --> 5783.36
so

5779.28 --> 5783.36
don't do that it's not working yeah

5783.679 --> 5787.36
lying doesn't work

5787.52 --> 5793.040000000001
it might work on really dumb people that

5790.48 --> 5794.879999999999
you probably deal with on a regular

5793.04 --> 5796.88
basis it might work on them right

5794.88 --> 5800.2390000000005
because they don't have the

5796.88 --> 5803.28
the oversight to catch on

5800.239 --> 5807.119
it doesn't work on people that do

5803.28 --> 5809.679
have smarts and that do have oversight

5807.119 --> 5812.239
we just know you're lying

5809.679 --> 5814.719
you're only fooling yourself in that

5812.239 --> 5815.919999999999
moment gaslighting yourself about what

5814.719 --> 5819.639
you said

5815.92 --> 5819.639
when you were lying

5834.159 --> 5837.48
which is

5861.6 --> 5866.84
make you seem dumber than you is a wise

5864.159 --> 5868.5599999999995
man once said

5866.84 --> 5870.4800000000005
well

5868.56 --> 5872.2390000000005
you know it's very easy to basically

5870.48 --> 5875.04
accomplish that all you have to do is

5872.239 --> 5876.959999999999
just be natural and not chisel

5875.04 --> 5879.28
everything to make yourself seem really

5876.96 --> 5882.28
smart

5879.28 --> 5882.28
right

5886.56 --> 5892.4800000000005
i don't know why you would have to like

5889.76 --> 5893.76
make effort to make yourself seem less

5892.48 --> 5895.919999999999
smart

5893.76 --> 5898.08
that that doesn't seem like something a

5895.92 --> 5899.52
wise man would say

5898.08 --> 5902.0
except maybe

5899.52 --> 5904.719
in a situation where tensions are very

5902.0 --> 5905.76
high and there's potentially war

5904.719 --> 5908.88
yes

5905.76 --> 5910.56
then i get it that's when you want to

5908.88 --> 5914.2390000000005
seem

5910.56 --> 5914.2390000000005
non-useful in ways

5914.88 --> 5920.400000000001
right

5917.04 --> 5920.4
but in general no

5921.199 --> 5924.4
just

5923.04 --> 5927.84
don't

5924.4 --> 5930.32
throw everything overboard that's human

5927.84 --> 5932.96
don't overthrow like

5930.32 --> 5935.92
human weakness too much

5932.96 --> 5937.6
or you'll just seem too threatening

5935.92 --> 5940.159
right

5937.6 --> 5944.8
my tactic through what i'm doing is

5940.159 --> 5944.799999999999
always show that i still have weaknesses

5948.8 --> 5952.1990000000005
then i do

5955.119 --> 5960.32
but i would never like try to downplay

5958.08 --> 5962.5599999999995
how smart i am

5960.32 --> 5964.159
absolutely not

5962.56 --> 5966.4800000000005
at the same time i wouldn't want to

5964.159 --> 5968.159
overplay it

5966.48 --> 5969.839999999999
i mean i've tried that a couple of

5968.159 --> 5973.119
occasions in the past and it's

5969.84 --> 5973.119000000001
completely pointless

5975.76 --> 5980.8
right but i've also known that just

5978.08 --> 5982.32
impression of people of how smart

5980.8 --> 5984.8
somebody is

5982.32 --> 5987.199
especially if they are not super smart

5984.8 --> 5988.2390000000005
themselves and don't really they look up

5987.199 --> 5991.199
to you

5988.239 --> 5994.919999999999
then it's not about smarts anymore

5991.199 --> 5994.919999999999
it's about a feeling

5998.08 --> 6002.8
it becomes more about respect and all

6000.719 --> 6005.28
that

6002.8 --> 6007.119000000001
that's the weird thing right

6005.28 --> 6009.36
people that you think are super

6007.119 --> 6010.799999999999
brilliant

6009.36 --> 6013.599999999999
you don't

6010.8 --> 6015.92
actually analyze a lot of the time their

6013.6 --> 6019.84
actual brilliance

6015.92 --> 6019.84
you end up more focused on

6020.159 --> 6023.839999999999
just like

6021.36 --> 6023.839999999999
who they are

6024.48 --> 6027.879999999999
and their balance

6041.52 --> 6047.6
i mean nobody likes a super smart person

6044.719 --> 6049.119
that's not likable

6047.6 --> 6050.96
yeah

6049.119 --> 6054.0
everybody usually just thinks there are

6050.96 --> 6054.0
pains in the ass

6060.159 --> 6065.5199999999995
if you're smart and you do not have the

6062.239 --> 6066.718999999999
likeability to accompany it

6065.52 --> 6069.360000000001
then

6066.719 --> 6072.32
you're gonna run into a lot of problems

6069.36 --> 6073.5199999999995
because with smarts also become comes

6072.32 --> 6075.599999999999
envy

6073.52 --> 6078.639
and jealousy from others always it

6075.6 --> 6080.96
always does

6078.639 --> 6084.2390000000005
and if you can't basically help them

6080.96 --> 6089.36
remedy that with what you do

6084.239 --> 6092.5199999999995
then they will like try to sabotage you

6089.36 --> 6092.5199999999995
it happens

6102.639 --> 6106.8
the wider i get the more my heroes die

6105.119 --> 6108.96
you know what i mean yes of course

6106.8 --> 6111.679
because all your heroes are still just

6108.96 --> 6113.04
human beings

6111.679 --> 6114.96
sometimes

6113.04 --> 6116.239
portraying an image

6114.96 --> 6118.32
right

6116.239 --> 6121.44
that's not real

6118.32 --> 6123.36
to the person but hey you

6121.44 --> 6124.719
people latch on to that and need it

6123.36 --> 6126.639
right sometimes

6124.719 --> 6129.6
especially younger people they often

6126.639 --> 6131.679
need icons they'll look up against so

6129.6 --> 6134.639
they can

6131.679 --> 6136.96
spiritually grow towards that like that

6134.639 --> 6139.6
yeah as an example

6136.96 --> 6142.159
even though that image they have of an

6139.6 --> 6145.4400000000005
individual is has nothing to do with who

6142.159 --> 6145.44
those people really are

6147.119 --> 6152.0
to them it's still like

6150.159 --> 6153.36
a sun

6152.0 --> 6156.0
to a plant

6153.36 --> 6158.08
it like it makes that it pulls them

6156.0 --> 6159.84
forward it makes them want to go it

6158.08 --> 6160.639
makes them want to be more than what

6159.84 --> 6163.84
they're

6160.639 --> 6163.84
where than where they're at

6164.0 --> 6166.32
right

6166.48 --> 6172.959999999999
but the individual

6168.639 --> 6172.96
that they often look up towards

6173.28 --> 6178.88
most of the time what they see in that

6175.84 --> 6181.28
is more about symbols and less about who

6178.88 --> 6183.76
the individual actually is

6181.28 --> 6185.5199999999995
and yeah if you that's very simple if

6183.76 --> 6187.400000000001
you really like a person and you start

6185.52 --> 6191.040000000001
looking up against them you'll

6187.4 --> 6193.28
automatically start dismissing things

6191.04 --> 6195.199
about them that you don't like

6193.28 --> 6197.44
it's almost like when you fall in love

6195.199 --> 6201.04
that happens but pretty extremely you

6197.44 --> 6202.879999999999
literally just can't see the flaws

6201.04 --> 6206.239
because you're in love

6202.88 --> 6208.719
that's a more extreme version

6206.239 --> 6211.5199999999995
people do that

6208.719 --> 6214.08
i notice it all the time it's confusing

6211.52 --> 6214.080000000001
as [ __ ]

6216.0 --> 6222.239
like i am very confused about how people

6219.199 --> 6224.32
are driven forth within their social

6222.239 --> 6228.919999999999
regards of others

6224.32 --> 6228.92
it's very confusing to me

6237.6 --> 6242.280000000001
hey man like me lou

6293.6 --> 6296.6
wow

6304.4 --> 6307.36
hey adam price

6308.08 --> 6312.88
yeah i'm probably gonna run out the show

6310.8 --> 6316.1990000000005
very soon

6312.88 --> 6316.1990000000005
what's interesting

6330.159 --> 6334.719
oh okay a man like me again i wasn't

6332.48 --> 6334.718999999999
sure

6338.56 --> 6344.679
oh that's okay cool i'm glad you're

6341.199 --> 6344.678999999999
enjoying it

6346.159 --> 6350.719
i may be finding a new flow guys like

6348.719 --> 6354.2390000000005
i've literally been wishing for that

6350.719 --> 6356.8
right i talked about the

6354.239 --> 6359.199
the easter challenge and the effects

6356.8 --> 6360.4800000000005
like the challenge and the reward and if

6359.199 --> 6365.199
you focus

6360.48 --> 6365.199
well i've been focusing like i want

6365.28 --> 6370.719
a new spring

6367.28 --> 6374.96
like how my inspiration works i've been

6370.719 --> 6374.96
doing things in a certain way right

6375.28 --> 6379.92
and like with certain energy and i've

6377.44 --> 6381.759999999999
just like yeah this

6379.92 --> 6385.119
it didn't feel

6381.76 --> 6387.6
stable anymore i was literally like in

6385.119 --> 6391.36
in the need for a new

6387.6 --> 6391.360000000001
way the energy comes through me

6392.08 --> 6397.44
and that's kind of what i wished for and

6394.4 --> 6398.96
i think it's happening i think that

6397.44 --> 6401.599999999999
the way

6398.96 --> 6403.52
i do my show now has been like

6401.6 --> 6406.159000000001
stabilized in a way

6403.52 --> 6407.6
i'd like to hear your long-term input

6406.159 --> 6410.96
about that

6407.6 --> 6413.679
guys i mean it's it's pretty recent

6410.96 --> 6416.4
like a week or so but i'd love to

6413.679 --> 6420.08
see like on the long run if that if it

6416.4 --> 6422.799999999999
is really significant if it like it is

6420.08 --> 6425.679
if it's really steady now anyway i'm

6422.8 --> 6425.679
rounding out the show

6426.159 --> 6431.36
uh

6427.199 --> 6431.36
good show thanks yeah thank you poppy

6434.639 --> 6439.52
i'm slowly becoming your favorite flat

6437.28 --> 6443.599999999999
earther i know everybody just

6439.52 --> 6446.4800000000005
i just grow on people i guess

6443.6 --> 6449.1990000000005
it's so funny because

6446.48 --> 6452.4
it's that includes people that i've

6449.199 --> 6455.599999999999
just like mercilessly analyzed and was

6452.4 --> 6456.799999999999
very harsh in my judgment about judge

6455.6 --> 6458.88
like

6456.8 --> 6460.88
harsh but fair

6458.88 --> 6463.92
and for some reason a lot of them just

6460.88 --> 6464.96
end up like really being fans i and i

6463.92 --> 6467.28
think

6464.96 --> 6469.199
i think that's good

6467.28 --> 6471.44
right

6469.199 --> 6472.879999999999
my motto for a long time

6471.44 --> 6474.799999999999
inspired

6472.88 --> 6477.28
by christ is that

6474.8 --> 6480.159000000001
technically most of the time we don't

6477.28 --> 6480.159
have enemies

6481.679 --> 6486.4800000000005
people just present themselves like

6483.679 --> 6488.719
enemies but those might just as well be

6486.48 --> 6489.599999999999
your friends in the future

6488.719 --> 6491.52
so

6489.6 --> 6493.280000000001
threat carefully

6491.52 --> 6495.1990000000005
like a lot of people think they're my

6493.28 --> 6496.84
enemies i just see them as future

6495.199 --> 6500.879999999999
friends that are still under the

6496.84 --> 6500.88
delusion that they're my enemy

6501.84 --> 6509.360000000001
and i think in a way that is christian

6506.08 --> 6511.679
that is like yeah don't just like attack

6509.36 --> 6513.44
your enemies know that they could be

6511.679 --> 6515.04
your friends at some point they have

6513.44 --> 6517.759999999999
inner things

6515.04 --> 6520.96
they have needs they want to be better

6517.76 --> 6523.280000000001
potentially recognize that and then

6520.96 --> 6525.28
feed into the good parts

6523.28 --> 6528.639
even as your enemies

6525.28 --> 6530.8
inspire nobility even in your enemies

6528.639 --> 6534.2390000000005
and then at some point they might stop

6530.8 --> 6536.400000000001
being your enemy and become your friend

6534.239 --> 6540.36
or at least be

6536.4 --> 6540.36
like on even terms

6540.96 --> 6545.84
right so that's yeah that's part

6543.76 --> 6549.119000000001
walking the path part of my

6545.84 --> 6551.119000000001
psychological route

6549.119 --> 6552.839999999999
and yeah i hope that everybody learns

6551.119 --> 6556.08
from

6552.84 --> 6558.2390000000005
that i certainly know that jim bob is

6556.08 --> 6559.679
doing the same thing in his own way even

6558.239 --> 6562.5599999999995
stronger right

6559.679 --> 6564.4
he's like really doing that like he can

6562.56 --> 6567.76
actually like

6564.4 --> 6569.679
go on with people into their delusions

6567.76 --> 6571.679
very strongly like he did with brenda

6569.679 --> 6574.639
like i wouldn't be able to

6571.679 --> 6575.76
get into brenda's mind and then on her

6574.639 --> 6577.84
level

6575.76 --> 6580.400000000001
work that out i would get a headache

6577.84 --> 6584.4800000000005
really quickly he's able to do that very

6580.4 --> 6584.48
eloquently so i feel like

6584.639 --> 6590.4800000000005
he's doing what i'm trying to do

6588.159 --> 6592.08
on the long run just regard like oh

6590.48 --> 6594.4
these people think they're your enemies

6592.08 --> 6596.4
but they're not they're just

6594.4 --> 6598.719
in a delusion

6596.4 --> 6600.638999999999
and you have to get help them get out of

6598.719 --> 6603.52
it

6600.639 --> 6606.08
that delusion specifically about the the

6603.52 --> 6607.92
hostility part right not necessarily

6606.08 --> 6610.08
their philosophical conviction because

6607.92 --> 6610.96
they might hold on to that their entire

6610.08 --> 6613.28
life

6610.96 --> 6614.08
but they don't need to hold on to that

6613.28 --> 6616.159
and

6614.08 --> 6618.48
think you're their enemy at the same

6616.159 --> 6618.48
time

6618.719 --> 6623.44
right anyway i'm rounding out

6620.88 --> 6626.639
