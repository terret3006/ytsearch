solar eclipse really

252.84 --> 255.84
what

256.32 --> 260.799
a solar eclipse on the summer solstice

266.84 --> 270.63899999999995
really

268.24 --> 270.639
let me

271.6 --> 283.84000000000003
[Applause]

273.919 --> 283.84
all right

285.6 --> 289.759
june 21st

292.56 --> 298.56
huh yeah

295.68 --> 298.56
apparently so

301.199 --> 308.32
all right it's it's not going to be

304.8 --> 308.32
visible from europe though

309.36 --> 316.16
seems to go over

313.039 --> 321.36
china moving past

316.16 --> 324.88000000000005
south of arabia into middle of africa

321.36 --> 328.16
if i am to believe this chart

324.88 --> 328.15999999999997
hmm all right

332.479 --> 335.44
yeah let's see if i can

337.44 --> 339.84
show that

341.36 --> 352.8
hold on it is interesting though it's a

345.039 --> 357.28
little interesting factoid

352.8 --> 357.28000000000003
right so this is apparently the path

357.44 --> 360.33
let's see if i can zoom that no that's

359.44 --> 363.51
not going to work

360.33 --> 363.51
[Music]

364.8 --> 370.639
oh wait i could full screen this huh

368.319 --> 370.639
right

372.0 --> 381.84
so okay that's gonna happen in

376.4 --> 381.84
two weeks

383.039 --> 395.84
thanks for the update

411.36 --> 416.96000000000004
oh dear yeah let's not get into that

414.24 --> 416.96000000000004
missouri bear

420.84 --> 425.599
ah

422.0 --> 428.8
it is pretty odd but yeah to me the

425.599 --> 432.88
the most illogical thing about the whole

428.8 --> 436.319
situation is that you don't see the moon

432.88 --> 439.52
at all when approaching you

436.319 --> 442.88
you just don't see it well

439.52 --> 446.0
there's no real reason for that like if

442.88 --> 448.08
it's gonna block the light then there's

446.0 --> 451.84
gonna be a shadow that you're gonna see

448.08 --> 451.84
it's like it would have to

458.24 --> 462.319
unless it's like light coming through a

461.28 --> 465.039
hole

462.319 --> 467.28000000000003
type situation and then the hole is

465.039 --> 469.44
closed off

467.28 --> 470.96
that's always what i thought it was like

469.44 --> 473.52
like there was a hole

470.96 --> 474.15999999999997
through which the sunlight is coming and

473.52 --> 479.84
then

474.16 --> 479.84000000000003
a stone rolls in front of it like that

480.0 --> 483.36
that's always what the yeah this solar

482.319 --> 486.40000000000003
eclipse

483.36 --> 489.91900000000004
reminded me of not really like an

486.4 --> 489.919
object is moving in front of it

490.72 --> 495.84000000000003
because you can't see it before the

492.56 --> 495.84
eclipse actually happens

503.599 --> 508.08
partial lunar eclipse friday evening

505.84 --> 508.08
okay

513.07 --> 516.109
[Music]

morning neil

545.44 --> 550.32
all right so uh

551.92 --> 555.8389999999999
yeah i went to bed really early

553.6 --> 556.399
yesterday i got up really early as a

555.839 --> 560.0
result

556.399 --> 561.12
it's kind of weird because i do feel

560.0 --> 564.0
like tired a lot

561.12 --> 566.48
i don't know yeah maybe it's because of

564.0 --> 566.48
the weather

567.76 --> 572.3199999999999
this type of weather does typically kind

569.92 --> 576.399
of tire me out especially if it

572.32 --> 579.0400000000001
proves proceeds really good

576.399 --> 579.04
sunny weather

585.279 --> 591.8389999999999
wow was it doing

592.11 --> 595.179
[Music]

602.839 --> 607.0400000000001
what okay

616.88 --> 621.519
all right and we're visited by troll

619.12 --> 621.519
goody

625.12 --> 633.839
lots of rainier

638.05 --> 643.2199999999999
[Music]

644.839 --> 647.839
hmm

658.839 --> 663.36
uh

660.64 --> 663.36
perfect piece

667.04 --> 669.36
what

671.519 --> 675.839
a voynich

679.76 --> 689.8389999999999
what the [ __ ]

696.959 --> 703.279
i think i

700.64 --> 704.0
i'm guessing something happened to rudy

703.279 --> 707.68
arthur

704.0 --> 707.68
because somebody's making trolls

709.76 --> 712.8
or maybe not i don't know did i miss

711.839 --> 717.44
something guys

712.8 --> 719.1999999999999
i haven't like watched a lot

717.44 --> 720.5600000000001
or anything at all really i i was kind

719.2 --> 724.1600000000001
of disconnected

720.56 --> 725.279
last yesterday after well i did good

724.16 --> 729.1999999999999
watch own benjamin

725.279 --> 732.399
which was cool but yeah after that

729.2 --> 732.399
pretty much disconnected

739.36 --> 745.839
i don't know maybe this is just my time

741.92 --> 745.8389999999999
where i just need to retract a little

748.48 --> 759.839
although yeah i'm gonna be back

752.0 --> 759.839
at the debates of course

767.04 --> 773.12
get some peace of mind from these trolls

770.079 --> 773.92
well it's it's a little bit more complex

773.12 --> 776.5600000000001
than that

773.92 --> 778.959
like i'm dealing with some weird

776.56 --> 780.4799999999999
personal issues i don't know man

778.959 --> 783.04
i think i'm i'm just gonna say it's

780.48 --> 786.8000000000001
because i'm 40 or something

783.04 --> 789.12
it's easy to say that

786.8 --> 789.12
what

790.959 --> 800.3199999999999
yeah i'm just not

794.24 --> 803.6800000000001
feeling in my spot like

800.32 --> 805.2
it's hard to describe i think that good

803.68 --> 808.399
surface probably

805.2 --> 808.399
feeling it from me

810.639 --> 817.6800000000001
it's weird and maybe he's experiencing

814.32 --> 820.72
something similar it's just

817.68 --> 825.279
like i worry a lot about my own

820.72 --> 829.839
inner feelings you know i really do

825.279 --> 829.8389999999999
it's like

831.04 --> 835.8389999999999
like often i just don't like where they

832.959 --> 838.56
go and then i

835.839 --> 839.519
like try to separate myself from

838.56 --> 842.2399999999999
something when it

839.519 --> 843.279
pulses and then get rid of it put it

842.24 --> 846.88
away

843.279 --> 847.199
but yeah that's it's kind of been part

846.88 --> 850.72
of

847.199 --> 852.56
my life and

850.72 --> 854.24
like i'm always trying to figure out

852.56 --> 856.399
like where is this coming from where's

854.24 --> 860.16
this impulse coming from

856.399 --> 863.36
and like can i ever truly

860.16 --> 865.279
tame it as it were is that possible

863.36 --> 867.6
what's gonna happen

865.279 --> 867.6
and

868.56 --> 871.8389999999999
yeah comparing myself to other people

871.12 --> 874.0
like

871.839 --> 876.399
what is the absence of that impulse

874.0 --> 879.04
basically leaving

876.399 --> 879.6
for people what is it like to not have

879.04 --> 883.8389999999999
that

879.6 --> 886.9590000000001
because yeah it is detectable

883.839 --> 890.8800000000001
doesn't have it or is when they they've

886.959 --> 894.2399999999999
gotten rid of it and my dad seems to be

890.88 --> 897.6
like yeah as i said extremely zen and he

894.24 --> 901.12
yeah he doesn't really have

897.6 --> 901.12
that that impulse anymore

901.44 --> 906.72
like which are ego related that's like

904.16 --> 908.88
the the mechanism that i've identified

906.72 --> 913.839
it to be tied in with

908.88 --> 913.8389999999999
what's going on

919.279 --> 927.8389999999999
did kiwi remove me from fed

922.399 --> 927.839
i don't know did he

928.56 --> 931.3599999999999
don't think so

934.48 --> 938.639
all right i remember now yeah one of the

937.68 --> 940.88
last

938.639 --> 942.72
yeah the ball busters thing i i really

940.88 --> 944.0
it was a premiere anyway but it was from

942.72 --> 948.0790000000001
way back

944.0 --> 952.32
when i first came on basically trying to

948.079 --> 955.519
put the issue with the whole light wave

952.32 --> 957.6800000000001
duality false dichotomy situation

955.519 --> 960.079
and yeah it was constantly being shoved

957.68 --> 962.56
in my shoes like i was trying to claim

960.079 --> 964.2399999999999
a wave which i obviously wasn't and

962.56 --> 966.2399999999999
spoke out about it

964.24 --> 968.32
and hey i did a good performance back

966.24 --> 971.36
then but i

968.32 --> 973.839
i did get kind of shoved

971.36 --> 976.72
around and yeah kiwi was in chat and he

973.839 --> 979.2790000000001
was doubling down like an [ __ ]

976.72 --> 980.88
because i think the qe just doesn't want

979.279 --> 982.16
to understand what i'm trying to point

980.88 --> 984.72
at

982.16 --> 987.279
it just doesn't wanna and i don't know

984.72 --> 990.24
what that means

987.279 --> 993.8389999999999
but i am going to absolutely do exactly

990.24 --> 993.839
the same thing as i always have

995.6 --> 1002.399
i'm going to yeah explain

999.12 --> 1004.079
what i think is wrong and then point out

1002.399 --> 1007.279
what i think it is and i've even

1004.079 --> 1009.279
figured out oh stop whining

1007.279 --> 1011.04
stop whining about kiwi it doesn't mean

1009.279 --> 1014.56
anything it's just

1011.04 --> 1016.56
it's just a base like kiwi response to

1014.56 --> 1019.1199999999999
anyone that kind of disagrees

1016.56 --> 1020.8
as if they have turned full-blown

1019.12 --> 1024.4
religious zealotard

1020.8 --> 1028.0
that that's what he always does and

1024.4 --> 1030.5590000000002
yeah it's not very nice to experience

1028.0 --> 1032.4
that but that's just how he does things

1030.559 --> 1035.199
and yeah i'm going to have to somehow

1032.4 --> 1037.199
disprove it to him

1035.199 --> 1039.1200000000001
his particle assumption and that's not

1037.199 --> 1041.919
going to work out because he has the

1039.12 --> 1043.1599999999999
the giant preponderance of quantum

1041.919 --> 1046.0790000000002
mechanics

1043.16 --> 1050.8400000000001
extrapolations to support

1046.079 --> 1054.1599999999999
his supposed claim on this

1050.84 --> 1057.28
so yeah all i can do is

1054.16 --> 1059.76
like try to re-examine it all

1057.28 --> 1060.799
like what is this the fraction cascade

1059.76 --> 1063.44
with light happening

1060.799 --> 1065.2
why does light always split up in more

1063.44 --> 1067.919
bands

1065.2 --> 1069.76
than any matter ever does it's not the

1067.919 --> 1072.48
same type of diffraction

1069.76 --> 1072.48
it just isn't

1074.16 --> 1081.8400000000001
i don't give a [ __ ] what he said rod

1076.24 --> 1081.84
levels you can piss off too

1105.36 --> 1110.24
yeah you can go too you know

1108.48 --> 1112.24
you don't really you're not really

1110.24 --> 1113.52
contributing anything you're just trying

1112.24 --> 1115.76
to

1113.52 --> 1117.28
create a rift of some kind because of

1115.76 --> 1119.679
something

1117.28 --> 1122.08
that's still going on that doesn't

1119.679 --> 1124.3200000000002
involve you

1122.08 --> 1125.28
you know you don't even know what the

1124.32 --> 1128.24
[ __ ] we're

1125.28 --> 1129.6
we're discussing why we have a problem

1128.24 --> 1132.32
what my problem with

1129.6 --> 1134.32
with kiwi's false dichotomy presentation

1132.32 --> 1137.28
is you don't even understand that

1134.32 --> 1138.24
or you would actually maybe feed me back

1137.28 --> 1143.44
some arguments

1138.24 --> 1147.039
instead of trying to oh kiwi hate you

1143.44 --> 1151.8400000000001
piss off you don't even know

1147.039 --> 1151.84
what the hell we're talking about

1154.799 --> 1160.72
right because there is an issue

1158.72 --> 1162.799
yeah i think light is infinitely

1160.72 --> 1164.96
divisible that's right

1162.799 --> 1165.84
but it seems that every time i suggest

1164.96 --> 1168.24
it

1165.84 --> 1171.039
it's never copied i've never heard

1168.24 --> 1174.32
nathan or kiwi or anyone

1171.039 --> 1178.28
other than you just repeat it like that

1174.32 --> 1181.9189999999999
nobody says it it's like they're afraid

1178.28 --> 1186.24
afraid to say that it might not be this

1181.919 --> 1189.8400000000001
this set mechanical globule of energy

1186.24 --> 1192.48
right no no no it can't be

1189.84 --> 1194.6399999999999
it can't be just that right because then

1192.48 --> 1198.799
everything becomes much more complicated

1194.64 --> 1200.3200000000002
oh no what about all the conclusions

1198.799 --> 1202.0
drawn from the mathematical

1200.32 --> 1203.52
extrapolations we know as quantum

1202.0 --> 1206.08
mechanics

1203.52 --> 1207.84
oh yeah yeah there is a problem there

1206.08 --> 1209.4399999999998
that's right

1207.84 --> 1211.28
i'd like to get that problem out of the

1209.44 --> 1213.679
way

1211.28 --> 1215.6789999999999
and to do that i have to figure out what

1213.679 --> 1218.5590000000002
light really is

1215.679 --> 1220.159
and what the mistaken assumptions have

1218.559 --> 1222.32
been so far

1220.159 --> 1224.4
and i highlight that on my show and

1222.32 --> 1227.9189999999999
every time it's brought up

1224.4 --> 1230.24
unless i'm not in the mood to

1227.919 --> 1232.48
yeah go against it then i'll probably

1230.24 --> 1234.32
speak out about it and then if nothing

1232.48 --> 1235.919
starts shaping me for it or whatever

1234.32 --> 1237.84
kiwi starts blasting over me

1235.919 --> 1241.039
then i'll just say go [ __ ] yourself and

1237.84 --> 1243.12
leave and then they can be

1241.039 --> 1246.0
then they can start squirting like a

1243.12 --> 1246.0
bunch of ballers

1246.08 --> 1249.4399999999998
and they can do that if they want

1247.6 --> 1253.12
because i don't give a [ __ ]

1249.44 --> 1257.039
it just makes me hate them lose respect

1253.12 --> 1259.84
not be as gracious in times of peace

1257.039 --> 1259.84
it's up to them

1260.32 --> 1263.9189999999999
because i don't like being disrespected

1263.039 --> 1265.919
when i make an

1263.919 --> 1267.3600000000001
actual good point and i don't like being

1265.919 --> 1270.72
rumpussed over and i don't

1267.36 --> 1273.039
like being oh complain complain

1270.72 --> 1274.64
why are you saying the same thing three

1273.039 --> 1276.1589999999999
times over again

1274.64 --> 1278.0800000000002
well it's because i'm not getting a

1276.159 --> 1279.8400000000001
freaking rebuttal

1278.08 --> 1282.08
i'm not getting a response from any of

1279.84 --> 1285.4399999999998
it i'm not getting told

1282.08 --> 1287.6
no that's not true this is why

1285.44 --> 1287.6000000000001
no

1288.799 --> 1306.8799999999999
so yeah that's just what it is

1304.32 --> 1306.8799999999999
hey tony

1307.48 --> 1311.63
[Music]

1313.12 --> 1316.8799999999999
what what's sleeping what is there to

1315.6 --> 1320.559
prevent

1316.88 --> 1320.5590000000002
the infinite splitting up

1320.799 --> 1325.52
and by the way infinite is is doesn't

1323.919 --> 1328.7990000000002
necessarily have to be

1325.52 --> 1332.24
absolutely literal it just means

1328.799 --> 1336.8799999999999
it is very likely it'll split up far

1332.24 --> 1339.1200000000001
beyond our capability of even sensing it

1336.88 --> 1341.2800000000002
that doesn't mean it is absolutely

1339.12 --> 1344.7199999999998
mathematically infinite

1341.28 --> 1346.48
it's just too infinite for us to ever

1344.72 --> 1348.64
figure out how small it really is

1346.48 --> 1349.52
it could be presupposed estimated

1348.64 --> 1352.64
calculated

1349.52 --> 1353.28
you know how that works but yeah if you

1352.64 --> 1355.5200000000002
can't

1353.28 --> 1356.799
figure it out you can't figure it out

1355.52 --> 1359.12
it's too small

1356.799 --> 1360.32
because yeah you can only figure it out

1359.12 --> 1363.1999999999998
by using

1360.32 --> 1364.32
other things that are small right and

1363.2 --> 1366.96
then comparing it

1364.32 --> 1366.96
like matter

1370.32 --> 1376.32
right and i've been thinking even

1373.6 --> 1378.559
you know if it is infinitely splittable

1376.32 --> 1381.9189999999999
and it's constantly refracting and

1378.559 --> 1383.6
just warping around in its in its

1381.919 --> 1387.3600000000001
smallness and splitting up

1383.6 --> 1390.0
compacting through various effects

1387.36 --> 1390.7199999999998
then yeah it does actually when i just

1390.0 --> 1393.76
thought about it

1390.72 --> 1396.24
again for like a hundredth time it just

1393.76 --> 1397.919
came to me like well maybe that's why it

1396.24 --> 1400.559
seems

1397.919 --> 1402.96
like it's behaving somewhat like a wave

1400.559 --> 1407.2
it's because of its infinite smallness

1402.96 --> 1411.28
it's like it almost becomes like a sea

1407.2 --> 1414.88
of lines and then then

1411.28 --> 1414.8799999999999
the wave-like behavior

1415.2 --> 1419.919
makes a little bit more sense it starts

1417.44 --> 1422.96
to you start to get a hint as to why

1419.919 --> 1425.1200000000001
it could behave

1422.96 --> 1427.44
somewhat like that but it doesn't mean

1425.12 --> 1431.9189999999999
that light itself is the wave

1427.44 --> 1435.2
it is not a wave but yeah

1431.919 --> 1438.5590000000002
you know when something is not

1435.2 --> 1440.159
a set size as much as everything else

1438.559 --> 1443.84
that surrounds it

1440.159 --> 1446.7990000000002
yeah it's gonna it's gonna lose the

1443.84 --> 1449.4399999999998
typical effects that are subjected

1446.799 --> 1449.44
to matter

1452.159 --> 1462.3200000000002
no it's no friction

1459.12 --> 1464.6399999999999
yeah anyway i'm basically this

1462.32 --> 1465.52
is not really going anywhere i'm just

1464.64 --> 1468.3200000000002
figuring out yeah

1465.52 --> 1469.6
i have suspicions i have a feel i have a

1468.32 --> 1472.6399999999999
direction but yeah it's

1469.6 --> 1473.6
it's gonna be have to be some real

1472.64 --> 1476.0800000000002
research

1473.6 --> 1477.12
that i would have to do hopefully with

1476.08 --> 1481.6
some assistance in

1477.12 --> 1484.1589999999999
optics to to clear it more up

1481.6 --> 1484.1589999999999
what it is

1485.279 --> 1489.919
and what causes the diffraction cascade

1488.4 --> 1501.8400000000001
effect

1489.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
what that is

1513.52 --> 1516.72
hey guppkin

1519.12 --> 1522.4799999999998
5 22 am

1524.159 --> 1529.8400000000001
all right you're uh on the west coast in

1527.36 --> 1532.7199999999998
the us

1529.84 --> 1532.72
good morning to you

1540.159 --> 1543.2
right yeah that's right sleeping warrior

1542.4 --> 1545.6000000000001
it's because

1543.2 --> 1547.76
after the scientific method the

1545.6 --> 1550.3999999999999
philosophy

1547.76 --> 1551.279
was subjected and that's what all the

1550.4 --> 1553.52
ballers are

1551.279 --> 1554.64
yeah hanging on to on all the

1553.52 --> 1558.1589999999999
philosophical

1554.64 --> 1559.8400000000001
refined ideas of what science the spirit

1558.159 --> 1563.44
of science is

1559.84 --> 1566.559
right overlooking the the critical

1563.44 --> 1567.679
empirical and rigid nature that makes it

1566.559 --> 1571.12
so solid

1567.679 --> 1573.76
and so reliable so yeah

1571.12 --> 1575.6
ballers always refer to science as the

1573.76 --> 1577.36
spirit of science pretty much in the

1575.6 --> 1580.7199999999998
philosophy

1577.36 --> 1584.08
and then even take it out of proportion

1580.72 --> 1587.2
like take away the critical

1584.08 --> 1588.8799999999999
elements of it and just make it as the

1587.2 --> 1590.64
spirit of science this is what it's

1588.88 --> 1593.3600000000001
supposed to be doing

1590.64 --> 1594.72
so you can be flexible well in reality

1593.36 --> 1599.84
you can't

1594.72 --> 1599.84
it's a very rigid method

1610.24 --> 1626.88
no and that's not true either september

1613.76 --> 1630.4
it's it's not true

1626.88 --> 1632.88
i knew a physicist and he he

1630.4 --> 1633.919
he figured out about flat earth and then

1632.88 --> 1636.0800000000002
somebody

1633.919 --> 1640.0
got to him intimidated him and then he

1636.08 --> 1642.96
stopped doing that

1640.0 --> 1644.48
but yeah he's a phys he was a physicist

1642.96 --> 1646.72
and he figured it out

1644.48 --> 1650.96
[Music]

1646.72 --> 1653.2
by himself and that was even before eric

1650.96 --> 1657.279
tobay and all that

1653.2 --> 1657.279
before 2015 way before that

1663.039 --> 1666.48
was it two thousand

1666.88 --> 1671.6000000000001
ten 2009 or something

1671.84 --> 1675.36
so yeah there are physicists that are

1674.159 --> 1678.24
flat earthers but

1675.36 --> 1678.8799999999999
yeah concerning their profession and all

1678.24 --> 1680.96
they

1678.88 --> 1682.159
probably don't really like to talk about

1680.96 --> 1686.159
it that much

1682.159 --> 1689.8400000000001
especially with how unbelievably

1686.159 --> 1693.7600000000002
manipulative and politicized

1689.84 --> 1695.84
media and institutions have become now

1693.76 --> 1697.52
yeah because yeah everybody's afraid to

1695.84 --> 1698.559
lose their job now if you're in that

1697.52 --> 1701.2
system

1698.559 --> 1702.24
so you're gonna subject yourself to

1701.2 --> 1705.279
censorship

1702.24 --> 1708.0
self-censorship because it sucks

1705.279 --> 1708.799
being honest in the system you get

1708.0 --> 1712.08
penalized

1708.799 --> 1713.039
all the time you get ejected just like

1712.08 --> 1715.36
that

1713.039 --> 1719.12
for no good reason other than you're

1715.36 --> 1721.6
telling the truth as you figured it out

1719.12 --> 1722.2399999999998
you dare to evade the narrative and

1721.6 --> 1726.32
doesn't have

1722.24 --> 1730.88
even have to really be

1726.32 --> 1733.4399999999998
like provably crazy

1730.88 --> 1734.24
it's just that saying like i don't think

1733.44 --> 1737.6000000000001
that this

1734.24 --> 1739.36
is legitimate while it's officially

1737.6 --> 1741.1999999999998
accepted as legitimate

1739.36 --> 1743.279
you know that can even bring you into

1741.2 --> 1746.3990000000001
trouble it doesn't even have to be

1743.279 --> 1746.399
related to flat earth

1749.039 --> 1756.1589999999999
you know there's just no go

1752.559 --> 1759.9189999999999
zones kind of yeah

1756.159 --> 1762.96
shared with teachers and

1759.919 --> 1764.8400000000001
and all these people and yeah

1762.96 --> 1766.3990000000001
if you go there you get a warning

1764.84 --> 1769.4399999999998
probably

1766.399 --> 1773.36
and then if you ignore that

1769.44 --> 1773.3600000000001
just just like that ignore it

1774.0 --> 1778.08
if you ignore it and you just go ahead

1776.08 --> 1780.0
anyway yeah you're probably going to

1778.08 --> 1782.399
lose your job

1780.0 --> 1795.84
and then they'll concoct all kinds of

1782.399 --> 1795.84
reasons for that

1803.84 --> 1810.72
are we convinced that atoms exist

1807.52 --> 1813.9189999999999
well i've seen

1810.72 --> 1816.72
like the the results of electron

1813.919 --> 1819.919
microscopes

1816.72 --> 1820.88
i thought it was convincing enough but

1819.919 --> 1824.3990000000001
does that mean we

1820.88 --> 1828.159
understand it the whole thing about it

1824.399 --> 1828.7199999999998
no just the existence of transmutation

1828.159 --> 1831.5200000000002
alone

1828.72 --> 1832.24
already puts in a lot of questions

1831.52 --> 1835.6
because

1832.24 --> 1837.84
the model is not foolproof that

1835.6 --> 1838.8799999999999
the entire yeah the chemistry model is

1837.84 --> 1842.0
not

1838.88 --> 1845.7600000000002
complete there's still just

1842.0 --> 1847.679
many big factors

1845.76 --> 1849.919
that don't make any sense in the current

1847.679 --> 1852.799
model like transmutation doesn't make

1849.919 --> 1852.7990000000002
any sense to me

1855.12 --> 1860.4799999999998
although yeah somebody that really has a

1858.32 --> 1862.72
fast understanding within physics and

1860.48 --> 1863.039
has experimented on this they probably

1862.72 --> 1868.0
will

1863.039 --> 1873.12
will be able to model how that effect

1868.0 --> 1873.12
works what what seems to be happening

1875.36 --> 1879.84
but yeah we don't get that in school

1892.08 --> 1909.6
hello guaranty well seeking star wars

1907.2 --> 1912.64
how i see atoms

1909.6 --> 1915.519
more universal manner is that

1912.64 --> 1916.3990000000001
what makes an atom an atom is that after

1915.519 --> 1918.24
a certain point

1916.399 --> 1921.84
if you try to split it up further it

1918.24 --> 1921.84
becomes something else

1929.519 --> 1935.84
bouncy balls devised by silly people

1942.32 --> 1948.559
i don't know i i'm not

1946.0 --> 1949.84
yeah i don't really have any problems

1948.559 --> 1952.96
with the

1949.84 --> 1955.279
idea of atomics just how that works

1952.96 --> 1957.519
it's when it gets even smaller you know

1955.279 --> 1959.279
when it gets to yeah what are electrons

1957.519 --> 1963.1200000000001
and protons and neutrons

1959.279 --> 1964.48
now that basic floating for chemistry it

1963.12 --> 1967.84
works great

1964.48 --> 1969.1200000000001
okay it does works fantastically

1967.84 --> 1971.6789999999999
but does that mean that the

1969.12 --> 1976.9599999999998
representation of it is exactly

1971.679 --> 1980.0
like the representation well

1976.96 --> 1981.8400000000001
probably not and that's where like

1980.0 --> 1982.799
making everything into little balls

1981.84 --> 1985.1999999999998
comes in

1982.799 --> 1986.72
and it's standard is used as standard

1985.2 --> 1990.0
practice even in

1986.72 --> 1993.039
in what is it the

1990.0 --> 1994.399
making atomic models it's all balls and

1993.039 --> 1999.039
sticks

1994.399 --> 2002.0
sticks connect the balls so yeah that's

1999.039 --> 2002.399
we are for default kind of condition

2002.0 --> 2006.0
just

2002.399 --> 2008.9599999999998
to visualize those things as little

2006.0 --> 2008.96
balls that's true

2015.279 --> 2020.0
toroids okay i was talking to rights

2018.0 --> 2023.039
okay

2020.0 --> 2023.039
i don't know if they are

2027.76 --> 2036.08
you know it it also kind of yeah

2032.559 --> 2038.48
what what is really going on within the

2036.08 --> 2038.48
atom

2040.88 --> 2048.7200000000003
and why are atoms like spherical

2044.72 --> 2052.0
or at least yeah they could they form

2048.72 --> 2053.5989999999997
in yeah it could be considered a a

2052.0 --> 2056.72
circuit a disk

2053.599 --> 2060.56
circle disk no a sphere

2056.72 --> 2061.04
and it's also like surface tension and

2060.56 --> 2064.72
all that

2061.04 --> 2068.56
would typically cause that anyway

2064.72 --> 2068.56
tensions so there's like

2068.639 --> 2071.839
i don't know i'm stumbling

2072.879 --> 2076.3199999999997
nobody's ever seen an atom

2078.96 --> 2082.639
all right well look if you don't want to

2080.639 --> 2083.28
believe in that if you don't want to go

2082.639 --> 2086.3990000000003
there

2083.28 --> 2089.44
then don't i'm not

2086.399 --> 2092.879
i don't see why i would just

2089.44 --> 2096.399
shove that entire thing aside like that

2092.879 --> 2098.56
i don't see what what the use of that is

2096.399 --> 2101.5989999999997
in in yeah getting further understanding

2098.56 --> 2103.44
i'd rather just get the

2101.599 --> 2105.44
the weird little things that haven't

2103.44 --> 2117.839
been explained properly and get them

2105.44 --> 2117.839
in view and understand them

2121.119 --> 2126.4
seen the periodic table based on the

2122.8 --> 2126.4
golden ratio no i haven't

2128.32 --> 2132.96
can we either photograph it oh please

2143.52 --> 2145.839
right

2146.8 --> 2150.5600000000004
in a way it is kind of funny though

2148.32 --> 2154.1600000000003
because if you consider that

2150.56 --> 2157.44
light is infinitely divisible

2154.16 --> 2159.92
or seemingly infinite much more

2157.44 --> 2163.2000000000003
divisible than any atom would be

2159.92 --> 2165.52
then yet theoretically even it might be

2163.2 --> 2169.5989999999997
possible to somehow

2165.52 --> 2172.56
photograph an atom in some way sort of

2169.599 --> 2174.1600000000003
because yeah if if you can gain control

2172.56 --> 2176.96
of that light

2174.16 --> 2177.7599999999998
even in microscopic levels then maybe it

2176.96 --> 2181.68
somehow is

2177.76 --> 2185.0400000000004
possible to do that although yeah the

2181.68 --> 2189.04
electron microscope

2185.04 --> 2189.04
you does it in another way

2189.599 --> 2193.2000000000003
it's not really photographing it's

2191.44 --> 2194.48
rather just sending these electric

2193.2 --> 2197.5989999999997
pulses

2194.48 --> 2199.52
and then by their pathway

2197.599 --> 2201.599
figure out what is in between in order

2199.52 --> 2202.0
to for them to go the pathways or that

2201.599 --> 2203.599
that's

2202.0 --> 2205.119
rather what it works how it works and

2203.599 --> 2207.52
then you get a model based on that

2205.119 --> 2207.52
readout

2211.839 --> 2216.48
walter was a water russell periodic

2214.16 --> 2216.48
table

2222.24 --> 2229.839
images of a hydrogen atom an image is

2226.839 --> 2229.839
it's

2240.839 --> 2243.839
right

2246.59 --> 2249.6490000000003
[Music]

2262.0 --> 2273.44
look it up i know walter russell is

2271.17 --> 2278.4
[Music]

2273.44 --> 2278.4
oh oh

2278.72 --> 2285.839
right that's the guy that ah that

2282.32 --> 2289.2000000000003
dejan came back with it has like this

2285.839 --> 2289.2
intricate idea

2289.599 --> 2299.839
yeah all right

2292.64 --> 2299.839
oh that chart looks interesting

2310.839 --> 2313.839
hmm

2328.48 --> 2334.32
i think it's like divided in frequency

2331.92 --> 2335.52
right that's what this periodic table is

2334.32 --> 2341.839
ordered like

2335.52 --> 2341.839
it's interesting

2343.68 --> 2346.48
i don't care

2347.92 --> 2352.0
stop getting my trying to get my

2350.0 --> 2352.8
attention you're not getting it i'm not

2352.0 --> 2356.0
interested

2352.8 --> 2357.92
okay not interested in conspiracy cats

2356.0 --> 2359.68
and whenever he does and even if he wins

2357.92 --> 2362.56
a million dollars

2359.68 --> 2365.04
and suddenly becomes a famous show host

2362.56 --> 2367.359
or whatever i'm still not gonna be

2365.04 --> 2371.2
interested in talking to him

2367.359 --> 2374.0
okay and if he wants to come on here and

2371.2 --> 2374.96
have a normal discussion again he could

2374.0 --> 2376.64
try that

2374.96 --> 2379.04
he's not gonna last very long because he

2376.64 --> 2382.3199999999997
always does the same [ __ ]

2379.04 --> 2385.2799999999997
so drop it anyway

2382.32 --> 2388.4
i'll share that image that walter

2385.28 --> 2397.8390000000004
russell's periodic table by the way

2388.4 --> 2397.839
yeah it is really impressive

2422.839 --> 2425.839
hmm

2427.2 --> 2432.72
yeah well hey the sine wave

2430.72 --> 2434.72
or however you're going to call it

2432.72 --> 2435.5989999999997
certainly seems to be a reoccurring

2434.72 --> 2440.3999999999996
theme

2435.599 --> 2440.4
in creation itself it's like even that

2440.96 --> 2444.079
swing of the pendulum is kind of what i

2442.64 --> 2446.72
call it and yeah

2444.079 --> 2449.04
it's fascinating how this guy figured

2446.72 --> 2453.839
that out and modeled it

2449.04 --> 2453.839
on chemistry

2464.839 --> 2467.839
hmm

2479.76 --> 2495.8390000000004
amen young

2506.16 --> 2513.68
oh god kind of a question is that

2510.96 --> 2523.839
conspiracy cats donated a million to me

2513.68 --> 2523.839
that's ridiculous

2539.72 --> 2543.62
[Music]

2546.73 --> 2551.839
[Music]

2548.839 --> 2551.839
hmm

2566.72 --> 2570.24
crazy when you have a better idea of the

2568.56 --> 2572.0789999999997
world than the respected leaders of the

2570.24 --> 2576.0789999999997
same place no that's not crazy at all

2572.079 --> 2576.079
that's actually historically normal

2576.64 --> 2580.24
people that attain a lot of power lose

2579.119 --> 2583.76
their minds

2580.24 --> 2589.2799999999997
or people that

2583.76 --> 2589.28
lose their minds seek a lot of power

2590.0 --> 2593.839
so yeah

2596.8 --> 2601.119
you don't need to know everything to be

2600.079 --> 2604.4
in control you just

2601.119 --> 2608.56
need to be able to fool everyone in

2604.4 --> 2608.56
thinking that you know everything

2610.01 --> 2613.1690000000003
[Music]

2617.119 --> 2620.2400000000002
and that's why they can be yeah

2618.96 --> 2624.16
completely dumb

2620.24 --> 2624.56
they just know what type of story to

2624.16 --> 2626.7999999999997
tell

2624.56 --> 2629.52
people in the right moment in order to

2626.8 --> 2631.599
make them do exactly what they want

2629.52 --> 2632.88
they don't need to know anything they

2631.599 --> 2635.839
don't need to know

2632.88 --> 2637.6800000000003
anything for sure they just need to know

2635.839 --> 2640.0789999999997
how to play

2637.68 --> 2641.68
things and stories and narratives and

2640.079 --> 2642.3300000000004
that's all they don't even have to

2641.68 --> 2645.44
understand it

2642.33 --> 2645.44
[Music]

2647.119 --> 2649.839
right

2655.92 --> 2660.4
right and often also not understanding

2659.2 --> 2663.7599999999998
things

2660.4 --> 2665.2000000000003
even has tactical advantages if winning

2663.76 --> 2666.8
and all that [ __ ]

2665.2 --> 2668.72
being on top is the only thing you

2666.8 --> 2669.2000000000003
really care about or if you don't know

2668.72 --> 2670.7999999999997
it

2669.2 --> 2672.72
if you don't understand it then you

2670.8 --> 2673.3590000000004
won't have to care for it you don't have

2672.72 --> 2677.839
to feel

2673.359 --> 2677.839
anything about it

2678.56 --> 2691.839
you know

2694.53 --> 2697.639
[Music]

2702.839 --> 2705.839
so

2719.14 --> 2722.21
[Music]

2735.599 --> 2740.319
right missouri bear well look everybody

2740.88 --> 2748.96
has a choice and freedom is really

2746.64 --> 2750.64
one of these choices it's like what

2748.96 --> 2754.2400000000002
exactly kind of freedom are you going to

2750.64 --> 2754.24
get and what is it going to cost you

2754.36 --> 2758.6400000000003
[Music]

2755.599 --> 2761.6800000000003
right so just

2758.64 --> 2762.4
unconditional freedom can never be

2761.68 --> 2765.9199999999996
correct

2762.4 --> 2767.6800000000003
it's never possible so just just freedom

2765.92 --> 2770.0
it doesn't mean anything

2767.68 --> 2772.319
it's actually an open playbook basically

2770.0 --> 2774.24
saying yeah if you take this

2772.319 --> 2776.079
that means that we can change whatever

2774.24 --> 2777.839
we want

2776.079 --> 2779.3590000000004
and then give you something in return

2777.839 --> 2780.88
and then call that freedom

2779.359 --> 2782.64
while it has nothing to do with that

2780.88 --> 2786.7200000000003
really

2782.64 --> 2788.64
so but i think that we do

2786.72 --> 2790.48
have freedom really especially in the

2788.64 --> 2791.5989999999997
west we have a lot of freedom it's just

2790.48 --> 2793.839
that

2791.599 --> 2794.96
with that freedom also comes that we're

2793.839 --> 2797.119
constantly being

2794.96 --> 2799.2
barraged by peer pressure and mind

2797.119 --> 2802.8
control from all sides

2799.2 --> 2806.0789999999997
even from within our own family

2802.8 --> 2808.079
that's the price for that actual freedom

2806.079 --> 2810.6400000000003
the freedom you actually have it's just

2808.079 --> 2813.8390000000004
that most people are made incapable of

2810.64 --> 2817.839
utilizing it because they're enslaved

2813.839 --> 2817.839
through their minds

2818.88 --> 2825.04
see so technically you are free

2823.359 --> 2827.68
that freedom comes with a price though

2825.04 --> 2830.56
and that price is

2827.68 --> 2831.839
fighting off mind control fighting off

2830.56 --> 2835.359
seductions and

2831.839 --> 2837.04
basically blackmailing that just happens

2835.359 --> 2841.44
you won't even realize it

2837.04 --> 2845.839
until it's too late complex [ __ ]

2841.44 --> 2845.839
that's the price for that freedom

2863.359 --> 2867.7599999999998
politicians think in terms of money not

2866.0 --> 2872.24
really

2867.76 --> 2874.559
no i don't think so

2872.24 --> 2876.8799999999997
politicians are in general much more

2874.559 --> 2879.76
concerned with

2876.88 --> 2882.079
getting things done and finding momentum

2879.76 --> 2882.079
and just

2882.16 --> 2888.64
yeah being able to drag people

2885.599 --> 2891.28
behind you money is

2888.64 --> 2893.04
really it's all fluid you know a lot of

2891.28 --> 2896.4
politicians have to do with just

2893.04 --> 2898.48
perpetual debt like they if they

2896.4 --> 2901.839
re if it's really about the money it's

2898.48 --> 2904.0
they're gonna drive them nuts

2901.839 --> 2906.64
sometimes politicians have to do just

2904.0 --> 2910.0
impossible things financially

2906.64 --> 2915.839
have to get it done somehow so

2910.0 --> 2915.839
yeah it's more about power exactly

2916.0 --> 2919.92
now of course money can provide all

2917.839 --> 2922.96
kinds of power but it is

2919.92 --> 2923.6800000000003
limited because if you don't have any

2922.96 --> 2925.92
respect

2923.68 --> 2929.52
then eventually people will stop taking

2925.92 --> 2933.52
your money

2929.52 --> 2933.52
unless things get really freaking

2934.33 --> 2937.46
[Music]

2940.839 --> 2943.839
complicated

2964.4 --> 2971.839
all right adam

2984.16 --> 2990.7999999999997
wow the u.s

2987.359 --> 2995.2
rap republicans spend 80

2990.8 --> 2995.2000000000003
percent of their time raising election

2996.839 --> 2999.839
funds

3006.64 --> 3013.839
but they can't just take any level of

3008.88 --> 3013.839
money you know

3014.0 --> 3021.04
so yeah raising funds

3017.68 --> 3024.5589999999997
that's gonna be from certain yeah

3021.04 --> 3027.599
certain people like if you're a

3024.559 --> 3030.4
what is it a

3027.599 --> 3030.8
republican or a good guy or something

3030.4 --> 3032.96
yeah

3030.8 --> 3034.8
taking money from george soros all of a

3032.96 --> 3037.839
sudden you know that's

3034.8 --> 3038.319
not gonna help that's gonna certainly

3037.839 --> 3040.48
switch

3038.319 --> 3041.359
everything around for that person unless

3040.48 --> 3044.319
they were

3041.359 --> 3045.839
kind of building towards that and

3044.319 --> 3046.72
everybody already felt it coming or

3045.839 --> 3049.52
something

3046.72 --> 3051.359
but yeah just just taking money no it's

3049.52 --> 3055.28
also about

3051.359 --> 3057.68
like the rep reputation and

3055.28 --> 3059.52
what are you associating with what can

3057.68 --> 3060.48
what do these people that are giving the

3059.52 --> 3062.96
money want

3060.48 --> 3064.319
most likely where are their interests

3062.96 --> 3069.839
going to be

3064.319 --> 3069.839
etc etc

3078.24 --> 3083.839
representatives okay fine

3086.92 --> 3093.38
[Music]

3099.14 --> 3102.33
[Music]

3108.839 --> 3115.92
wow all right

3113.2 --> 3116.96
i'm not very familiar about the details

3115.92 --> 3119.839
uh

3116.96 --> 3125.839
the u.s election system i just know how

3119.839 --> 3125.839
it roughly works

3132.0 --> 3138.72
billion just to run for president yes

3134.24 --> 3143.4199999999996
that's insane

3138.72 --> 3143.4199999999996
[Music]

3150.64 --> 3153.839
my mom

3157.68 --> 3167.839
hey miss kang

3178.839 --> 3181.839
okay

3192.839 --> 3197.2
hmm only the very very rich can apply i

3196.64 --> 3201.52
don't know

3197.2 --> 3202.319
i don't think so but if a not so very

3201.52 --> 3205.359
very rich

3202.319 --> 3208.079
person would apply then they might have

3205.359 --> 3209.52
too much trouble with the

3208.079 --> 3213.2000000000003
what they would be facing from the

3209.52 --> 3213.2
opposition after that you know

3214.8 --> 3219.2000000000003
because yeah if your competition is

3217.44 --> 3221.28
gonna be billionaires and all that

3219.2 --> 3224.0789999999997
they're gonna use that against you if

3221.28 --> 3224.079
you try to run

3234.839 --> 3237.839
so

3240.96 --> 3250.16
right i can push

3244.24 --> 3253.7599999999998
anyone forward well not anyone

3250.16 --> 3255.04
this on they i don't know so far it

3253.76 --> 3259.8390000000004
seems like they just

3255.04 --> 3262.24
shoved the most popular people forward

3259.839 --> 3264.5589999999997
people that just won't get in the way of

3262.24 --> 3279.839
the presidential program as it is being

3264.559 --> 3279.8390000000004
rolled out

3283.68 --> 3293.2
all right yeah you go squirt

3286.72 --> 3293.2
fine let's get outraged about all the

3304.839 --> 3307.839
individuals

3323.28 --> 3328.559
hmm right well they lie ohio the

3326.319 --> 3329.92
the idea of endless supply for

3328.559 --> 3332.6400000000003
advertising

3329.92 --> 3334.0
and that that's what the money is used

3332.64 --> 3336.96
for so much

3334.0 --> 3338.559
it is because the advertising in the

3336.96 --> 3341.68
united states has become

3338.559 --> 3344.079
very high-tech weaponized

3341.68 --> 3344.96
very effective so what they're then just

3344.079 --> 3347.6800000000003
counting on

3344.96 --> 3349.44
is that if you just throw enough

3347.68 --> 3351.68
programming

3349.44 --> 3353.04
hard enough program that is just you

3351.68 --> 3355.04
can't escape from

3353.04 --> 3356.88
you won't even know in what sense it's

3355.04 --> 3358.96
going to be programming to some degree

3356.88 --> 3359.52
you'll see the more apparent programming

3358.96 --> 3363.2
and then

3359.52 --> 3365.52
not see the much deeper pro if they just

3363.2 --> 3367.04
throw powerful enough programming

3365.52 --> 3368.64
against the entire public

3367.04 --> 3370.079
they are probably convinced that they'll

3368.64 --> 3372.24
just get control that people will

3370.079 --> 3373.119
literally just fall to their knees from

3372.24 --> 3375.839
a headache

3373.119 --> 3379.6800000000003
basically i think that is part of the

3375.839 --> 3379.68
strategy in the united states for the

3380.559 --> 3386.88
yeah for the empire that's their

3383.92 --> 3386.88
that's their tactic

3387.68 --> 3394.24
just brainwash the citizens into

3391.599 --> 3394.2400000000002
submission

3395.599 --> 3400.88
and i guess they're doing it because it

3397.2 --> 3400.8799999999997
seems to work pretty damn well

3402.16 --> 3410.0
like completely

3405.52 --> 3411.839
like idiotic aggressive lunatics are not

3410.0 --> 3412.48
a rare thing anymore in the united

3411.839 --> 3414.5589999999997
states

3412.48 --> 3417.52
like people that literally go with

3414.559 --> 3421.8390000000004
whatever no matter how shameful it is

3417.52 --> 3424.4
there is plenty of that and that's a

3421.839 --> 3425.2
yeah telltale sign that the waters are

3424.4 --> 3427.44
perfect for

3425.2 --> 3429.04
absolute mind control that it'll work

3427.44 --> 3430.799
enough

3429.04 --> 3432.64
so the people at the bottom there that

3430.799 --> 3437.04
are completely lost

3432.64 --> 3438.799
they will resonate like animated puppets

3437.04 --> 3440.079
for that mind control because they have

3438.799 --> 3442.319
no control

3440.079 --> 3443.6800000000003
of their own so they become the mind

3442.319 --> 3446.64
control

3443.68 --> 3447.1189999999997
it is their program it's what they then

3446.64 --> 3450.24
will

3447.119 --> 3452.079
latch onto and become and resonate it

3450.24 --> 3454.16
and push it on others as well

3452.079 --> 3456.48
so the waters are perfect for absolute

3454.16 --> 3458.0789999999997
mind control domination

3456.48 --> 3461.839
have been for a while it's been growing

3458.079 --> 3461.8390000000004
and growing worse

3463.839 --> 3468.96
and in a way so with europe to some

3466.799 --> 3471.2
degree as well but the united states is

3468.96 --> 3471.2
just

3471.52 --> 3476.92
several degrees further and we are

3474.559 --> 3478.559
getting barraged by mind control and

3476.92 --> 3482.319
nitpickyness and just

3478.559 --> 3485.0400000000004
liberal whininess to no end

3482.319 --> 3486.48
but if you then look at the people yeah

3485.04 --> 3488.96
the normies are kind of

3486.48 --> 3490.079
drenched in that but there's still just

3488.96 --> 3494.96
plenty of people

3490.079 --> 3498.799
that are like just trying to

3494.96 --> 3499.76
er yeah ignore that part just move past

3498.799 --> 3502.88
it

3499.76 --> 3506.2400000000002
or outgrow it

3502.88 --> 3506.2400000000002
overcome it make their own thing

3507.2 --> 3514.0
but in the united states it's just not

3510.319 --> 3517.839
yeah it's not so good

3514.0 --> 3517.839
it's worse

3528.839 --> 3531.839
yep

3544.96 --> 3573.839
what all right

3559.839 --> 3573.839
it's not surprising john bernard

3578.92 --> 3581.969
[Music]

3595.2 --> 3600.0789999999997
okay guns of their own rmp could be in a

3597.92 --> 3602.319
way an indirect way

3600.079 --> 3603.92
like if you land yourself in a position

3602.319 --> 3604.48
where your spirit just has no more

3603.92 --> 3607.92
control

3604.48 --> 3610.799
whatsoever then you're gonna be a puppet

3607.92 --> 3614.079
by your own choice and it's

3610.799 --> 3616.319
and your your needs

3614.079 --> 3617.76
what you can't let go of is going to

3616.319 --> 3620.079
keep you effectively in

3617.76 --> 3622.88
in place like a carrot on the stick is

3620.079 --> 3625.599
gonna make you keep going

3622.88 --> 3626.88
and you will then effectively adapt to

3625.599 --> 3630.319
whatever

3626.88 --> 3633.599
mode you need including satan

3630.319 --> 3638.5589999999997
himself in order to yeah

3633.599 --> 3638.559
to keep that all going you know

3641.52 --> 3657.839
but you do it by choice

3662.52 --> 3665.869
[Music]

3668.839 --> 3673.909
ah

3670.86 --> 3673.909
[Music]

3679.66 --> 3682.8799999999997
[Music]

3688.88 --> 3693.92
two different ideas on what satan is of

3691.68 --> 3697.52
probably all over the place

3693.92 --> 3698.88
i see satan as a a spirit almost like an

3697.52 --> 3702.48
aberration of the

3698.88 --> 3702.48
design of creation itself

3708.559 --> 3714.559
in a way satan is the spirit of control

3711.92 --> 3719.76
it is the mechanisms that

3714.559 --> 3723.119
keep people in their control position

3719.76 --> 3726.48
as their life is effectively ravaged

3723.119 --> 3728.7200000000003
spiritually from the inside out as part

3726.48 --> 3730.88
of that whole process

3728.72 --> 3730.8799999999997
but

3734.96 --> 3741.839
so yeah anyway

3739.28 --> 3741.8390000000004
uh

3766.839 --> 3769.839
so

3775.29 --> 3778.429
[Music]

3787.839 --> 3793.92
all right satan worshipping zombies like

3791.2 --> 3793.9199999999996
power and

3795.2 --> 3804.24
and yeah power without responsibility

3799.68 --> 3806.24
that's basically the promotion of satan

3804.24 --> 3810.0789999999997
it's just saying no you have all that

3806.24 --> 3814.0
freedom and no responsibility

3810.079 --> 3817.2000000000003
effectively what that is and it is

3814.0 --> 3820.24
a a childish

3817.2 --> 3822.96
seduction also it's very

3820.24 --> 3839.839
it it's ignorant in nature and it

3822.96 --> 3839.839
perpetuates ignorance

3859.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
all right

3874.64 --> 3881.839
a little more colored you're late

3894.24 --> 3898.16
legal rights to the whole world

3898.48 --> 3903.599
yeah you know what i'm just kind of sick

3902.079 --> 3907.2000000000003
of staring at satan

3903.599 --> 3909.3590000000004
i'm not interested in him i i'm getting

3907.2 --> 3911.52
kind of sick of him

3909.359 --> 3913.0389999999998
you know first your discovery means like

3911.52 --> 3916.0
what the [ __ ] is this

3913.039 --> 3918.2400000000002
like with christianity and like god and

3916.0 --> 3920.16
all that and

3918.24 --> 3924.4799999999996
and then yeah you can get obsessed with

3920.16 --> 3926.5589999999997
it i'm just really sick of it

3924.48 --> 3929.599
like i'm at the point where i just

3926.559 --> 3929.599
having trouble even

3929.76 --> 3936.079
like i almost want to

3932.799 --> 3938.799
just deny its existence not because i

3936.079 --> 3939.54
can't handle it but because i

3938.799 --> 3942.16
deemed to

3939.54 --> 3944.079
[Music]

3942.16 --> 3945.2799999999997
maneuver the world in some way to a

3944.079 --> 3948.8390000000004
point where it will

3945.28 --> 3950.0
be gone i don't know if that makes any

3948.839 --> 3952.0
sense

3950.0 --> 3954.16
maybe i'm just being really really

3952.0 --> 3955.76
intolerant

3954.16 --> 3959.1189999999997
of something that nobody should be

3955.76 --> 3959.119
tolerant of but

3959.46 --> 3962.53
[Music]

3977.28 --> 3981.039
why would i say satan's he because

3979.359 --> 3981.44
that's the first thing that comes to

3981.039 --> 3984.0
mind

3981.44 --> 3984.0
that's all

3988.24 --> 3991.68
thanks to miss kang it gets exhausting

3990.799 --> 3994.88
yeah

3991.68 --> 3998.5589999999997
and i get exhausted a lot these days

3994.88 --> 4002.1600000000003
it's and it's almost hard to justify

3998.559 --> 4005.3590000000004
like for real so please don't take this

4002.16 --> 4006.319
too personal but it's every time people

4005.359 --> 4009.7599999999998
bring that up

4006.319 --> 4013.2
i get annoyed i think that

4009.76 --> 4015.5200000000004
owen benjamin has had similar issues

4013.2 --> 4017.5989999999997
although yeah his crowd can get even

4015.52 --> 4019.599
more rowdy and on average

4017.599 --> 4020.799
and i don't want to offend anyone but

4019.599 --> 4023.76
it's

4020.799 --> 4025.44
i'd like to move on like i realize

4023.76 --> 4029.2000000000003
creation

4025.44 --> 4032.48
and i'm actually i've adapted everything

4029.2 --> 4034.0
to that insight but to then just keep on

4032.48 --> 4038.64
reverting back to like

4034.0 --> 4041.28
the intro story to the inside basically

4038.64 --> 4043.0389999999998
it's getting a bit annoying to me maybe

4041.28 --> 4046.3190000000004
i'm just sick of it

4043.039 --> 4049.3590000000004
for now like tired of

4046.319 --> 4051.44
the story you know people do get tired

4049.359 --> 4051.44
of

4060.839 --> 4063.839
stories

4065.2 --> 4070.0
jesus comes daily but it is

4071.119 --> 4078.1600000000003
he's he's just there it's there

4074.799 --> 4083.28
it's always there he was always there

4078.16 --> 4083.2799999999997
it's there why would he be coming

4083.839 --> 4091.839
when he's there

4092.4 --> 4096.16
the converter of energy right

4098.319 --> 4102.2390000000005
and not just energy also purpose

4103.12 --> 4106.08
there's more than that

4106.319 --> 4119.839000000001
it can be quite radical

4126.159 --> 4134.159
worry why would you worry worry for what

4130.159 --> 4137.12
for yourself uh technically i'm not

4134.159 --> 4138.08
even well yeah it's not like i'm not

4137.12 --> 4141.44
worrying ever

4138.08 --> 4143.679
i worry a lot about things but i'm not

4141.44 --> 4145.678999999999
even worried about that like yeah the

4143.679 --> 4146.0
world has gone freaking insane and

4145.679 --> 4147.679
people

4146.0 --> 4149.12
are sick and encouraged to get even

4147.679 --> 4151.279
worse and

4149.12 --> 4152.64
nobody upholding the flame of honor

4151.279 --> 4156.080000000001
anymore it's like

4152.64 --> 4158.839
people are afraid or ashamed to do that

4156.08 --> 4160.0
as a natural thing as i feel kind of

4158.839 --> 4163.2789999999995
alone

4160.0 --> 4166.159
but i'm not afraid

4163.279 --> 4166.159000000001
to be alone

4166.56 --> 4172.96
it gets really lonely really

4170.159 --> 4175.3589999999995
really lonely and that's a loneliness

4172.96 --> 4177.839
that cannot be

4175.359 --> 4179.279
altered it can be taken away by just

4177.839 --> 4182.4
being among people

4179.279 --> 4182.400000000001
it doesn't work like that

4182.48 --> 4188.639999999999
but i'm not afraid i'm not afraid

4186.56 --> 4190.64
because i understand like what that

4188.64 --> 4193.12
satan is what this

4190.64 --> 4194.400000000001
the weakness is and where it's coming

4193.12 --> 4197.679
from

4194.4 --> 4200.0
why people are in that

4197.679 --> 4202.159
and it yeah it also pisses me off but it

4200.0 --> 4204.4
pisses me off because i kind of

4202.159 --> 4205.199
understand it if i wouldn't understand

4204.4 --> 4207.92
it

4205.199 --> 4209.759999999999
then i'd probably probably be afraid and

4207.92 --> 4212.56
hey the mechanism itself of

4209.76 --> 4213.4400000000005
evil is a defense mechanism because

4212.56 --> 4216.719
you're

4213.44 --> 4219.28
there's no evil without fear

4216.719 --> 4220.159
critical evil is usually fear based

4219.28 --> 4224.239
purely

4220.159 --> 4227.5199999999995
it's another mind and it is like a

4224.239 --> 4232.239
also a bluff mechanism partially

4227.52 --> 4232.2390000000005
it's to just make people submit

4233.04 --> 4237.6
but yeah if you don't understand what it

4235.6 --> 4240.719
is yeah it can be extremely

4237.6 --> 4244.64
scary if you can

4240.719 --> 4247.679
distinguish between just dark minds

4244.64 --> 4250.719
and people bluffing and [ __ ] or

4247.679 --> 4252.88
rubbing off nasty ideas

4250.719 --> 4254.4800000000005
and people that are actually like in the

4252.88 --> 4256.719
middle of engaging

4254.48 --> 4260.239
of lethal force for some reason because

4256.719 --> 4260.2390000000005
those things are very different

4266.159 --> 4273.28
but you need to really understand

4270.0 --> 4276.64
evil in order to figure that out

4273.28 --> 4277.92
and through experience or it's usually

4276.64 --> 4279.280000000001
you only learn that thing through

4277.92 --> 4280.08
experience and i think that anybody

4279.28 --> 4283.84
that's

4280.08 --> 4287.44
been in the military can con yeah

4283.84 --> 4288.96
can agree to that

4287.44 --> 4301.839999999999
not that i've been in the military by

4288.96 --> 4301.84
the way it's been through plenty of [ __ ]

4314.96 --> 4321.84
rice experiments what

4318.64 --> 4321.84
what rice experiments

4322.8 --> 4329.84
george sanford

4345.84 --> 4357.84
what looks like i i could scrap

4348.88 --> 4357.84
what does that mean

4365.36 --> 4371.839999999999
what's scrapping

4372.159 --> 4389.04
accept cancelling

4385.12 --> 4391.04
fighting oh no

4389.04 --> 4392.08
look i'm a terrible fighter well no i'm

4391.04 --> 4394.64
not

4392.08 --> 4395.76
it's just that i'm not somebody to

4394.64 --> 4399.84
constantly

4395.76 --> 4403.52
yeah i'm not even

4399.84 --> 4405.84
yeah i can i could survive i've had some

4403.52 --> 4408.88
training

4405.84 --> 4410.88
but i'm not really a big guy

4408.88 --> 4412.08
and even if i had more muscles it

4410.88 --> 4415.1990000000005
probably wouldn't help

4412.08 --> 4419.199
too much c is red

4415.199 --> 4419.199
yeah well for me

4419.44 --> 4424.879999999999
i think that my strength lies in my

4422.64 --> 4427.52
speed and potential viciousness that

4424.88 --> 4431.28
literally would come out of nothing

4427.52 --> 4434.400000000001
so like a yeah wolverine style

4431.28 --> 4437.599999999999
but like

4434.4 --> 4441.839999999999
i really don't like fighting

4437.6 --> 4441.84
it really repulses me

4446.32 --> 4451.28
you know the idea of fighting

4449.44 --> 4453.44
kind of appealed to me even as it was a

4451.28 --> 4455.36
boy you know computer games or

4453.44 --> 4456.719
slaughter more and shoot them all and

4455.36 --> 4459.839999999999
blah blah

4456.719 --> 4461.28
but the more

4459.84 --> 4462.88
i came loose from that and actually

4461.28 --> 4463.92
looked in the world the more i realized

4462.88 --> 4466.88
is that

4463.92 --> 4468.08
in reality it's just disgusting it

4466.88 --> 4472.400000000001
should be avoided at

4468.08 --> 4472.4
all costs almost all cost

4474.08 --> 4479.04
and i can feel that more i i don't

4476.32 --> 4482.08
associate that original like fantasy

4479.04 --> 4484.239
violence and [ __ ] in your head

4482.08 --> 4486.5599999999995
and in games and movies i don't

4484.239 --> 4489.759999999999
associate that with the real

4486.56 --> 4497.84
thing anymore i keep that apart don't

4489.76 --> 4497.84
mix them in

4501.12 --> 4505.37
right fighting is the last resort well

4504.32 --> 4506.48
look

4505.37 --> 4509.679
[Music]

4506.48 --> 4511.28
if i if i do some training you know and

4509.679 --> 4513.12
i wouldn't do that on my own because

4511.28 --> 4515.44
it's like boring [ __ ]

4513.12 --> 4517.04
but yeah if i'd like get back into some

4515.44 --> 4519.599999999999
fighting sport or something

4517.04 --> 4520.48
back to taekwondo or any other type

4519.6 --> 4522.4800000000005
thing

4520.48 --> 4524.48
some guys or something yeah sure i could

4522.48 --> 4525.199
get a lot better again especially now

4524.48 --> 4528.879999999999
that i am

4525.199 --> 4531.28
supplementing on a way

4528.88 --> 4532.4800000000005
my food is just so much better than like

4531.28 --> 4534.48
20 years ago

4532.48 --> 4535.599999999999
it's a whole world of different so in a

4534.48 --> 4539.839999999999
way i kind of like

4535.6 --> 4539.84
to try it out at some point again

4543.6 --> 4547.120000000001
but for now the yeah the physical

4545.36 --> 4553.12
exercise that i do is just

4547.12 --> 4555.76
whatever i'm gonna do on my bicycle or

4553.12 --> 4556.5599999999995
just walking the stairs whatever i do

4555.76 --> 4559.679
i'm gonna do it

4556.56 --> 4559.679
as if it were sport

4560.48 --> 4563.44
or an exercise

4563.76 --> 4570.159000000001
and that's kind of how i keep fit enough

4567.199 --> 4570.159
not to go nuts

4574.64 --> 4581.84
all right

4592.239 --> 4597.04
right yeah that's sensible rain

4594.56 --> 4597.04
arthritis

4597.28 --> 4603.12
yeah that's right you can't lose it if

4600.239 --> 4603.12
you're carrying a gun

4606.84 --> 4609.84
never

4620.84 --> 4623.84
oh

4625.6 --> 4630.8
yeah well missouri bear sometimes you

4627.679 --> 4630.8
know a bigger guy

4631.04 --> 4637.12
it doesn't really matter if they're not

4633.92 --> 4639.12
ready to do it because sometimes bigger

4637.12 --> 4640.0
guys are just like oh i'm too tough for

4639.12 --> 4642.0
you anyway

4640.0 --> 4643.52
so they think they'll just dominate you

4642.0 --> 4645.6
but if you're then going

4643.52 --> 4647.92
fighting then they'll be like what the

4645.6 --> 4651.84
[ __ ] and they're not

4647.92 --> 4651.84
prepared to actually do it

4661.6 --> 4666.64
i think on average unless you're like

4664.48 --> 4669.919999999999
completely cocked out

4666.64 --> 4672.4800000000005
naturally smaller people tend to be

4669.92 --> 4673.84
ready to fight on a moment's notice more

4672.48 --> 4675.44
because they have to because they're

4673.84 --> 4679.84
smaller

4675.44 --> 4679.839999999999
it's more dangerous

4680.64 --> 4693.84
i think i don't know

4706.4 --> 4721.839999999999
figure there are they fall don't tell

4708.08 --> 4721.84
big bear

4737.92 --> 4743.12
all right missouri bear it's a bit

4741.36 --> 4745.599999999999
weird that he'd fall in love with the

4743.12 --> 4747.84
weapon though but

4745.6 --> 4750.08
i don't know maybe it's an american

4747.84 --> 4750.08
thing

4757.92 --> 4762.719
although i don't know if i'd had a

4760.32 --> 4765.84
decent gun and it was okay

4762.719 --> 4766.8
and normal and i could shoot and train

4765.84 --> 4777.84
then i'd probably

4766.8 --> 4777.84
learn to appreciate it too

4788.84 --> 4791.84
so

4802.84 --> 4805.84
so

4809.44 --> 4816.08
right yeah it's true guns of nephron rmp

4813.36 --> 4818.239
short man syndrome yeah you can turn

4816.08 --> 4822.679
into a total [ __ ]

4818.239 --> 4825.678999999999
and just constantly ego issues and

4822.679 --> 4827.84
overcompensating or you can literally

4825.679 --> 4830.88
just say okay i'm i'm small that means

4827.84 --> 4830.88
i'm gonna have to be tough

4831.44 --> 4834.638999999999
like i'm not gonna stay behind just

4832.96 --> 4837.28
because i'm smaller

4834.639 --> 4838.56
and then they yeah if they have the

4837.28 --> 4839.759999999999
spirit

4838.56 --> 4841.6
and if they don't yeah if it gets

4839.76 --> 4845.6
distinguished then they get cocked and

4841.6 --> 4848.2390000000005
annoying and start to behave

4845.6 --> 4849.1990000000005
like a certain people in a certain

4848.239 --> 4851.759999999999
category

4849.199 --> 4851.759999999999
of hats

4854.96 --> 4859.36
but yeah it doesn't have to turn out

4856.56 --> 4862.8
that way and you can become mighty

4859.36 --> 4866.719
like that as big bear call it

4862.8 --> 4867.360000000001
like mighty mouse small but very

4866.719 --> 4875.84
powerful

4867.36 --> 4875.839999999999
very strong willed

4883.12 --> 4886.32
people don't get weird when you're

4884.639 --> 4889.84
swinging a hammer

4886.32 --> 4891.199
well i'd get a little weird this is

4889.84 --> 4893.28
and then again when you're swinging a

4891.199 --> 4893.678999999999
hammer the path of where that hammer

4893.28 --> 4895.679
could

4893.679 --> 4899.36
do damage is a lot more apparent with a

4895.679 --> 4899.36
gun because a gun it's

4900.8 --> 4903.84
a lot more sudden

4910.88 --> 4916.8
but i guess you're talking about

4912.4 --> 4931.839999999999
swinging a hammer outside i i wouldn't

4916.8 --> 4931.84
do that inside my house

4939.6 --> 4945.84
what okay that's crazy more colored

4963.44 --> 4969.44
well did you tell them uh she had

4966.48 --> 4972.32
attempted to freaking bash my head in

4969.44 --> 4973.839999999999
with a hammer

4972.32 --> 4976.96
like show them like hey there's the

4973.84 --> 4976.96
hammer see

4983.199 --> 4988.799999999999
and they still arrested you a bunch of

4986.239 --> 4988.799999999999
[ __ ]

4993.36 --> 5001.839999999999
a bunch of white knight [ __ ]

5007.52 --> 5014.080000000001
oh yeah that that could be an issue

5010.639 --> 5015.12
yeah but i'm not gonna even talk about i

5014.08 --> 5018.5599999999995
don't even wanna know

5015.12 --> 5018.5599999999995
