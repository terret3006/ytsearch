so yeah as you can already

106.079 --> 113.119
deduce from my attire

109.36 --> 115.2
it's hot again although there's a lot of

113.119 --> 118.64
this

115.2 --> 120.88
a lot of haze up there i'm not sure

118.64 --> 123.28
it's all due to planes there are some

120.88 --> 125.92
trails see

123.28 --> 128.0
if you can see it i don't know if it's

125.92 --> 132.64000000000001
all from that

128.0 --> 135.52
because i yeah i kept slapping sleeping

132.64 --> 137.599
until like 10 o'clock so and it was

135.52 --> 140.84
already like this then

137.599 --> 143.83999999999997
anyway it's a very hot day it's more

140.84 --> 146.959
moist

143.84 --> 148.239
thick feels more moist anyway i still

146.959 --> 150.48
got my fan

148.239 --> 151.68
my roommate hasn't claimed it back yet

150.48 --> 155.04
so

151.68 --> 157.519
it's been very nice last night

155.04 --> 158.239
although i can't yeah because it has a

157.519 --> 160.16
usb

158.239 --> 162.4
interface i can basically install it

160.16 --> 165.92
next to my bed

162.4 --> 165.92000000000002
but as long as i'm sitting here

166.08 --> 175.12
i got noise and refreshment all right

171.599 --> 177.11999999999998
anyway yeah i got

175.12 --> 179.59900000000002
plenty of drinks with me today i got the

177.12 --> 182.48000000000002
same drink as yesterday

179.599 --> 184.319
with the carrot yeah the fruit the

182.48 --> 186.879
fruits with some carrot and

184.319 --> 189.35999999999999
yeah i thought it was too sweet so i

186.879 --> 191.51899999999998
diluted it with two thirds water

189.36 --> 192.48000000000002
and then i put it in a cooler overnight

191.519 --> 195.68
guess what

192.48 --> 198.159
it's the perfect drink now like

195.68 --> 199.20000000000002
one bottle basically now means three

198.159 --> 201.599
bottles

199.2 --> 205.04
of really good drink i just have to yeah

201.599 --> 205.04
dilute it into another bottle

209.44 --> 217.12
ah it really is

212.72 --> 220.319
great maybe even better than

217.12 --> 224.08
than just the lemon juice

220.319 --> 225.51899999999998
that i had also just some general water

224.08 --> 229.12
also cool

225.519 --> 231.68
and a another half of an illuminati

229.12 --> 231.68
croissant

233.92 --> 237.76
because yeah i don't know that's

235.2 --> 238.48
actually kind of nice when it's this hot

237.76 --> 243.04
too it's

238.48 --> 243.04
better than yeah other options

246.56 --> 251.519
there's only one downside to it and yeah

249.68 --> 253.68
that is that i have to basically warm it

251.519 --> 256.0
up in a microwave for a minute

253.68 --> 258.799
it's not the best of things my opinion

256.0 --> 263.28
but yeah i don't have a functioning oven

258.799 --> 266.32
and they don't like

263.28 --> 268.4
eat it over at the eco plaza

266.32 --> 270.24
anymore they used to that's where i

268.4 --> 272.63899999999995
brought it from every time

270.24 --> 275.04
they still sell them pre-packaged and

272.639 --> 275.04
cooled

275.52 --> 279.919
and yeah it's the only way i'm gonna get

277.28 --> 284.55999999999995
it for now until we get a new

279.919 --> 284.56
oven basically that is working so

286.479 --> 290.0
yeah let's see who is in chat

292.56 --> 300.08
okay ajm was first amanda young

295.6 --> 302.8
kim robinson good servant

300.08 --> 302.8
obermoco

304.8 --> 313.28000000000003
estez moretz julio pavin good to see you

310.32 --> 313.28
purple rock star

314.16 --> 318.40000000000003
guns of navarone rnp hana koala

322.84 --> 328.88
dank

325.28 --> 333.039
yeah good to see you all on a monday

328.88 --> 334.8
it's monday again weekend a hot weekend

333.039 --> 336.84
it seems like the weather forecast over

334.8 --> 341.759
here is saying it's gonna cool down

336.84 --> 341.75899999999996
somewhat pretty much until next weekend

346.4 --> 353.84
those guns this is no this is just

350.08 --> 353.84
arms i'm not that strong

354.479 --> 358.4
but at least i'm not chubby

362.4 --> 372.08
so ah right oh god

368.0 --> 377.36
i really should learn to make more notes

372.08 --> 377.35999999999996
i keep on not doing it stupid

378.84 --> 381.84
uh

385.84 --> 397.84
let's see

394.24 --> 397.84000000000003
what do you mean purple rockstar

404.319 --> 409.84000000000003
you're right guns of nephron

410.16 --> 413.759
certainly seems to be my primary focus

412.479 --> 417.52
of strength

413.759 --> 418.0
at least although i've never been really

417.52 --> 421.039
like

418.0 --> 424.16
weak you know not really

421.039 --> 426.8
it's just like this mid strength and

424.16 --> 428.56
yeah i don't know i just have like very

426.8 --> 431.44
burst like energies

428.56 --> 433.68
but it doesn't last very long and i have

431.44 --> 435.199
worked on that too on my condition as it

433.68 --> 438.639
were

435.199 --> 440.0
but yeah i was never like i was always

438.639 --> 443.919
like a sprinter guy

440.0 --> 448.479
and not a last long kind of condition

443.919 --> 448.479
guy compared to like some of my friends

449.039 --> 453.12
i don't know why it's just the way i

450.88 --> 453.12
work

458.24 --> 464.24
yeah and speed is a big part of that

462.0 --> 465.44
but it is also to do it has to do with

464.24 --> 467.759
the spirit

465.44 --> 470.879
as well yeah yeah your spirit has to

467.759 --> 470.879
just do that

470.96 --> 479.84
anyway uh putting the cooler back on

475.12 --> 479.84000000000003
it's really freaking

482.16 --> 485.12
sorry for the noise

491.039 --> 497.599
so yeah i'm kind of curious like what

494.24 --> 500.879
what was that with the volume yesterday

497.599 --> 502.639
why was it turned back

500.879 --> 504.16
i still have to kind of fine tune it i

502.639 --> 504.479
think it's probably still a bit too high

504.16 --> 507.44
but

504.479 --> 508.08
it just doesn't seem like the what is it

507.44 --> 512.959
the pop

508.08 --> 515.68
filter mechanism the thing

512.959 --> 517.4399999999999
that i installed a while back it just

515.68 --> 518.8
doesn't seem to work anymore i don't

517.44 --> 521.839
understand why

518.8 --> 521.8389999999999
it didn't change anything

522.64 --> 526.0
anyway figured out

532.399 --> 535.839
right uh

540.16 --> 545.4399999999999
all right yeah that's right yeah

543.6 --> 548.48
yeah there was no owen benjamin except

545.44 --> 550.24
like an older episode

548.48 --> 554.8000000000001
restream he's just too busy with his

550.24 --> 554.8
family that's nobody's gonna blame him

558.56 --> 562.399
sorry guys it's probably gonna take a

560.64 --> 565.76
while for me to

562.399 --> 567.519
get it all in order because it's just

565.76 --> 570.48
really hot

567.519 --> 572.399
but i did watch man of steel again

570.48 --> 575.76
yesterday

572.399 --> 578.0
it's been a long time since i seen that

575.76 --> 581.36
when i first saw it i wasn't in the mood

578.0 --> 581.36
of it for it at all

581.68 --> 585.04
this time a little bit more

585.92 --> 590.0
and it's it's kind of a conflicting

589.36 --> 592.16
movie because

590.0 --> 594.0
there are parts of it that is that i do

592.16 --> 594.48
really appreciate and on the other side

594.0 --> 599.12
there's

594.48 --> 601.9200000000001
a lot of this like this christ

599.12 --> 604.32
or yeah luciferian christ projection

601.92 --> 606.0
situation going on it always has been

604.32 --> 608.32
concerning superman you know the story

606.0 --> 611.279
of superman

608.32 --> 612.1600000000001
but yeah they kind of like really

611.279 --> 614.399
doubled down

612.16 --> 617.4399999999999
on those things in this movie it's very

614.399 --> 620.0
apparent that they have

617.44 --> 620.5600000000001
but yeah at the same time it also gives

620.0 --> 624.64
like a

620.56 --> 628.2399999999999
a wider context to general zod

624.64 --> 631.36
and also the yeah their kryptonia

628.24 --> 632.399
their their krypton culture like they

631.36 --> 635.92
went for

632.399 --> 638.88
eugenics uh basically yeah they went

635.92 --> 641.36
full eugenics like okay

638.88 --> 643.519
natural born is no longer allowed and

641.36 --> 645.6800000000001
they're all grown in pots specifically

643.519 --> 646.8
genetically designed for a purpose and

645.68 --> 649.1999999999999
all that like

646.8 --> 652.4799999999999
it's that sort of futurism and they give

649.2 --> 656.24
some backstory to that as well

652.48 --> 660.16
and that they did kind of put

656.24 --> 663.2
into a fair context i

660.16 --> 666.399
like that about it you know so

663.2 --> 669.36
yeah but like some of the action is kind

666.399 --> 674.079
of like out of proportion

669.36 --> 677.6
like superman is trying to

674.079 --> 679.68
be very responsible he has some anger

677.6 --> 682.88
issues it seems that it's not strange

679.68 --> 686.079
with the world and the way it is and

682.88 --> 689.8389999999999
life lessons with dad and all that

686.079 --> 689.8389999999999
so he's more human that way

692.0 --> 696.959
but yeah like

695.12 --> 698.72
the amount of damage that he causes

696.959 --> 700.3199999999999
eventually when he goes face to face

698.72 --> 703.839
with zod in the end is just

700.32 --> 703.839
like insane

704.48 --> 706.8000000000001
and

710.8 --> 716.079
yeah there like i heard it before the

713.36 --> 719.44
way he like cries out about eventually

716.079 --> 722.079
killing zod is kind of ridiculous

719.44 --> 723.2790000000001
after everything that has just happened

722.079 --> 726.079
in that sense

723.279 --> 727.519
although everybody will at least get the

726.079 --> 729.4399999999999
idea behind it but it's

727.519 --> 732.0
kind of seen misplaced like that one

729.44 --> 734.5600000000001
scene was right like misplaced

732.0 --> 737.04
also yeah i noticed in this movie how

734.56 --> 739.4399999999999
weird the whole mechanics are about

737.04 --> 741.279
what supposedly provides superman his

739.44 --> 742.8800000000001
powers and how that works and the

741.279 --> 744.88
atmosphere in the sun and

742.88 --> 747.8389999999999
then it works then it doesn't that was

744.88 --> 751.12
kind of messed up in it they

747.839 --> 753.2790000000001
they were too switcheroo

751.12 --> 756.24
with on and off and on and off with it

753.279 --> 757.8389999999999
that was kind of ridiculous about it

756.24 --> 759.6800000000001
on the technical side other than that i

757.839 --> 764.8800000000001
thought it was pretty a cool movie

759.68 --> 764.88
i guess bit long bit over the top

767.12 --> 772.24
why not place behind your mic

770.32 --> 773.6800000000001
because then it's going to blow onto the

772.24 --> 777.04
mic what do you think

773.68 --> 777.04
here you think this is better

782.24 --> 786.0
it doesn't seem to make much difference

784.0 --> 787.68
except that if i put it behind

786.0 --> 789.92
the mic it's not going to reach me as

787.68 --> 794.079
well so

789.92 --> 794.079
i think it's better like this actually

795.519 --> 800.9590000000001
hey viola literally yeah good to see you

798.88 --> 804.16
yeah yeah i i did

800.959 --> 804.16
follow your hangout too

808.48 --> 817.12
it's nice to see you are here

814.48 --> 817.9200000000001
because i did ask you like would you

817.12 --> 820.32
review

817.92 --> 820.3199999999999
my

821.519 --> 826.16
my form of christianity basically and we

823.6 --> 828.88
had a very long conversation over skype

826.16 --> 831.68
which was kind of intense

828.88 --> 833.4399999999999
i yeah you know that about me i think i

831.68 --> 834.88
am like that you know once there is like

833.44 --> 837.44
a one-on-one connection i

834.88 --> 839.6
really pile the whole thing on there

837.44 --> 842.639
sorry about that

839.6 --> 845.279
it's kind of i guess

842.639 --> 845.6800000000001
some people think say that's like like

845.279 --> 848.72
an

845.68 --> 852.399
autistic spectrum kind of thing

848.72 --> 855.44
with me i hope you understand it

852.399 --> 857.839
just yeah i can be very intense just one

855.44 --> 857.839
one anyway

858.8 --> 865.68
yeah yeah thanks for being very

861.839 --> 868.5600000000001
understanding and yeah you were

865.68 --> 870.2399999999999
basically you put yourself into yeah a

868.56 --> 872.7199999999999
priest function

870.24 --> 875.839
and i was kind of like confessing that

872.72 --> 878.0790000000001
was the energy flow how it established

875.839 --> 881.44
i do have need for that because like

878.079 --> 884.0
yeah i burden myself with a lot of like

881.44 --> 885.12
ideas like i've done a lot wrong and

884.0 --> 888.16
that i'm

885.12 --> 888.5600000000001
scared of doing more wrong and all that

888.16 --> 890.88
so

888.56 --> 890.88
anyway

894.32 --> 900.72
but yeah thanks for the conversation

897.76 --> 901.92
it was full chat conversation by the way

900.72 --> 904.32
but

901.92 --> 904.3199999999999
anyway

908.079 --> 911.4399999999999
yeah and and the things you said were

910.72 --> 914.1600000000001
very

911.44 --> 915.6
they were very encouraging i was just

914.16 --> 916.88
you know sometimes when you're like

915.6 --> 920.32
dwelling

916.88 --> 923.6
in something if

920.32 --> 927.1990000000001
if a retort you get is like almost

923.6 --> 928.399
is like it just shoves it off the table

927.199 --> 930.959
and just says no it's

928.399 --> 932.32
it really is all right like you really

930.959 --> 935.1199999999999
have nothing to worry about then

932.32 --> 937.759
sometimes it just bounces off

935.12 --> 939.6
and i have noticed that with other

937.759 --> 942.8000000000001
people too

939.6 --> 945.6
you know even though i typically don't

942.8 --> 946.7199999999999
approach them on that hardline christian

945.6 --> 949.44
thing

946.72 --> 950.1600000000001
because i do think it's important i'm

949.44 --> 952.399
just

950.16 --> 953.6
not that interested in it because it's

952.399 --> 956.72
almost like too simple

953.6 --> 957.9200000000001
it seems too simple my mind i guess or

956.72 --> 962.32
my ego doesn't

957.92 --> 965.36
like it that it's that simple

962.32 --> 965.36
but that's my problem

967.12 --> 971.759
anyway nice yeah nice of you to join me

972.32 --> 974.639
uh

975.44 --> 983.839
right this morning it didn't do too much

979.519 --> 983.839
oh wait i did watch another video

995.6 --> 1010.0
let me find it what the

999.68 --> 1012.56
okay that's not what i was looking for

1010.0 --> 1012.56
hold on

1015.04 --> 1020.639
all right yeah for another video from

1017.6 --> 1020.639
robert saffier

1022.399 --> 1031.28
was it uh he did this one on

1027.12 --> 1033.52
july 30th so that's like

1031.28 --> 1035.199
not even yeah a little over a week ago i

1033.52 --> 1037.12
i missed these things

1035.199 --> 1038.48
i don't know why but i missed it back

1037.12 --> 1042.0
then

1038.48 --> 1044.48
this one was about high brazil

1042.0 --> 1046.48
or as he calls it the irish atlantis it

1044.48 --> 1048.4
was really interesting because hey i

1046.48 --> 1052.72
talked about it

1048.4 --> 1055.2
a bit before that very raw speculation

1052.72 --> 1055.76
because of high brazil also being

1055.2 --> 1058.4
mentioned

1055.76 --> 1060.16
in eric the viking and i yeah i

1058.4 --> 1062.72
recommend that people watch that movie

1060.16 --> 1064.16
it's like yeah you're a flat earther

1062.72 --> 1066.08
right you're interested in that you

1064.16 --> 1067.76
gotta freaking watch it like they have a

1066.08 --> 1068.559
freaking edge that they're going over

1067.76 --> 1071.76
with the button

1068.559 --> 1073.6789999999999
you just gotta see it it's it's very

1071.76 --> 1075.679
fascinating that a movie like that was

1073.679 --> 1081.039
just there

1075.679 --> 1082.799
and also because it's really impressive

1081.039 --> 1085.44
you know the way they've done that those

1082.799 --> 1087.76
scenes but yeah hi brazil is in there

1085.44 --> 1088.72
and this guy robert shaffer he's like

1087.76 --> 1090.64
really

1088.72 --> 1092.96
really well read into things and he

1090.64 --> 1094.72
basically put down all the history

1092.96 --> 1096.799
this high brazil i never even heard of

1094.72 --> 1100.72
that before apparently it was

1096.799 --> 1102.8799999999999
really like an island

1100.72 --> 1104.0
also the meaning of the word brazil he

1102.88 --> 1106.64
gave so much back

1104.0 --> 1107.36
information about it but it was

1106.64 --> 1112.16
apparently an

1107.36 --> 1112.1599999999999
island somewhere was it again

1113.36 --> 1119.1999999999998
yeah next to next to ireland

1116.96 --> 1120.32
ireland roughly yeah maybe i'll i'll

1119.2 --> 1123.039
show the uh

1120.32 --> 1124.32
i'll share the map on which it is

1123.039 --> 1128.0
visible

1124.32 --> 1129.6789999999999
also put the link of it in the chat

1128.0 --> 1132.24
because i do recommend you watch this

1129.679 --> 1134.24
this is a good stuff

1132.24 --> 1136.4
oh by the way thank you that flat that

1134.24 --> 1137.679
flat fella for the 99 cent super chat

1136.4 --> 1140.5590000000002
donation

1137.679 --> 1140.5590000000002
thank you very much

1142.16 --> 1144.64
hold on

1146.88 --> 1151.2800000000002
yeah this noise i think it kind of sucks

1149.919 --> 1153.679
even for me

1151.28 --> 1155.36
but it is helping me keeping me cool a

1153.679 --> 1157.919
lot

1155.36 --> 1159.28
it really does help as long as i just

1157.919 --> 1161.76
don't dry myself up

1159.28 --> 1161.76
anyway

1162.84 --> 1165.84
see

1173.52 --> 1176.6399999999999
right so here

1177.2 --> 1185.3600000000001
uh see i hope you can see my mouse

1181.52 --> 1185.36
yeah yeah you can see it right here see

1186.48 --> 1192.24
bra feel so

1189.84 --> 1193.6789999999999
this was apparently a little island

1192.24 --> 1196.96
called brazil it's

1193.679 --> 1198.24
it's under the sea now it sank sank back

1196.96 --> 1202.24
into the sea

1198.24 --> 1202.24
and even robert zephyr later

1202.32 --> 1207.84
mentioned that there is another island

1204.08 --> 1207.84
that's also called brazil

1208.64 --> 1216.159
here's another one here

1213.12 --> 1216.1589999999999
hi brazil

1219.12 --> 1224.4799999999998
and let's see no mentions of eric the

1222.559 --> 1226.6399999999999
viking by the way

1224.48 --> 1228.96
probably didn't want to all right you

1226.64 --> 1228.96
got some

1229.36 --> 1232.24
some scanning

1232.88 --> 1239.44
and look see there is like this

1236.4 --> 1242.4
slightly heightened region there

1239.44 --> 1244.559
and even yes he also talked about how

1242.4 --> 1248.0
probably during

1244.559 --> 1251.9189999999999
the ice age the the ocean

1248.0 --> 1253.36
was lower so europe and england was

1251.919 --> 1257.039
probably more mainland

1253.36 --> 1263.36
back then you know so yeah anyway

1257.039 --> 1265.44
interesting thing it's a 22

1263.36 --> 1268.3999999999999
minute video which is not that long at

1265.44 --> 1271.52
all so i recommend you watch that

1268.4 --> 1272.3200000000002
and subscribe to robert zaffir if you

1271.52 --> 1274.48
haven't already

1272.32 --> 1276.0
he has some very interesting videos he

1274.48 --> 1279.919
makes and he has a lot of books too

1276.0 --> 1282.24
and all that it's of course a bigger

1279.919 --> 1282.24
channel

1283.12 --> 1290.08
also he he does also like

1287.039 --> 1294.799
address tartaria and all that a lot

1290.08 --> 1294.799
so anyway

1300.64 --> 1305.76
oh thank you good servant for the 99

1303.6 --> 1319.84
cent super chat donation as well

1305.76 --> 1319.84
much appreciated

1326.48 --> 1333.6
hmm yeah guns of nephron rmp

1331.52 --> 1335.6
like you said i wonder if when an

1333.6 --> 1338.08
atheist dies and all of a sudden their

1335.6 --> 1339.84
soul resurrects out of their dead body

1338.08 --> 1341.6
quite a surprise for someone expect to

1339.84 --> 1344.9599999999998
be worm food

1341.6 --> 1348.48
well i think that even among

1344.96 --> 1350.0
atheists there is like this idea that

1348.48 --> 1352.96
your spirit might live

1350.0 --> 1356.08
without your body at least for a while

1352.96 --> 1359.1200000000001
because there is so much

1356.08 --> 1362.48
i guess empirical evidence or

1359.12 --> 1366.2399999999998
pointers for that you know

1362.48 --> 1368.559
many ideas that even atheists can latch

1366.24 --> 1368.559
onto

1372.84 --> 1375.84
so

1382.24 --> 1386.84
when a christian dies they wonder what

1384.32 --> 1389.84
they got dressed up for

1386.84 --> 1389.84
what

1403.2 --> 1417.8400000000001
all right

1420.0 --> 1422.32
hmm

1424.24 --> 1431.84
okay again

1437.039 --> 1445.84
yeah i could go with that anyway

1456.84 --> 1459.84
uh

1461.039 --> 1473.84
and make a note

1491.44 --> 1495.8400000000001
yeah i hope there's going to be a flat

1492.88 --> 1497.3600000000001
earth debate today by the way

1495.84 --> 1501.84
i don't know if nathan's got his

1497.36 --> 1501.84
computer together just yet

1520.72 --> 1529.76
soul sleep right

1524.799 --> 1532.8799999999999
but yeah i don't know about that either

1529.76 --> 1536.559
you know does a soul even need sleep

1532.88 --> 1539.679
it's i guess it's kind of like

1536.559 --> 1544.32
a way to describe a sensation from an

1539.679 --> 1544.3200000000002
earthly living perspective there paula i

1554.84 --> 1559.9189999999999
think

1556.96 --> 1562.159
good and evil conscious in the afterlife

1559.919 --> 1564.96
wow

1562.159 --> 1564.96
what does that mean

1567.36 --> 1575.52
does that mean that your spirit

1571.36 --> 1579.039
might split up in the afterlife

1575.52 --> 1579.039
is that what what you mean or

1580.799 --> 1584.0
weirdly enough that would might actually

1583.039 --> 1588.08
kind of make sense

1584.0 --> 1591.12
to me based on my dark world experiences

1588.08 --> 1599.84
it all seemed very compartmentalized

1591.12 --> 1599.84
i don't know

1603.6 --> 1613.84
the person's spirit is conscious whether

1605.76 --> 1613.84
they are good or bad

1616.88 --> 1619.1200000000001
okay

1623.6 --> 1631.4399999999998
now to be fair biblically i i haven't

1628.159 --> 1634.4
really looked into the story of lazarus

1631.44 --> 1636.4
i recognize the name i recognize he had

1634.4 --> 1639.279
some serious issues

1636.4 --> 1639.679
but i i have yeah i haven't really in

1639.279 --> 1644.72
that

1639.679 --> 1644.72
study yet you know

1646.72 --> 1650.24
except for what i catch on to through

1649.279 --> 1653.6
others like you

1650.24 --> 1655.679
when you talk about in-depth subjects

1653.6 --> 1657.4399999999998
and i happen to be there i really like

1655.679 --> 1659.44
that because for me that's a really good

1657.44 --> 1661.52
opportunity to get to

1659.44 --> 1664.559
refine some of my insight and i do

1661.52 --> 1668.0
absorb it very well you do

1664.559 --> 1670.72
provide information in a very good

1668.0 --> 1683.279
and broad and clear way i like that it

1670.72 --> 1687.2
helps a lot

1683.279 --> 1687.2
two lazarus okay

1688.88 --> 1697.8400000000001
and the other was a poor beggar okay

1715.039 --> 1731.529
down here

1725.26 --> 1731.529
[Music]

1733.95 --> 1737.029
[Music]

1750.84 --> 1753.84
one

1753.919 --> 1763.5200000000002
j m l r what who

1758.0 --> 1763.52
i don't see him oh wait there is

1765.12 --> 1769.6789999999999
when do i think nathan will be back

1766.88 --> 1772.3200000000002
while as soon as his computer is working

1769.679 --> 1775.039
uh hopefully that's already there but it

1772.32 --> 1775.039
could be that

1775.12 --> 1778.32
yeah he doesn't have it yet i know his

1776.96 --> 1780.32
fridge is repaired

1778.32 --> 1783.36
at least but i don't know about his

1780.32 --> 1783.36
computer just yet

1783.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
and even if he had the money it still

1785.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
had to build the thing probably

1806.84 --> 1809.84
so

1828.559 --> 1831.6789999999999
yeah i don't know about that the menu i

1830.399 --> 1837.84
don't know if i'm gonna have like a

1831.679 --> 1837.8400000000001
multiple hour show in weekdays

1838.88 --> 1846.0
well in in on another note

1842.159 --> 1849.5200000000002
if there's really no debates of any kind

1846.0 --> 1852.72
then maybe i might just

1849.52 --> 1856.799
do a second hour or something and

1852.72 --> 1856.799
and get some people in there maybe

1857.279 --> 1862.96
i don't know the problem is just

1860.88 --> 1865.279
if it's gonna be as hot as it is right

1862.96 --> 1866.159
now i don't really feel like doing that

1865.279 --> 1869.2
too much

1866.159 --> 1870.5590000000002
like actually leading the show now if i

1869.2 --> 1873.6000000000001
just have to sit back

1870.559 --> 1875.44
and be a panelist then yeah it's more

1873.6 --> 1877.1999999999998
doable because i can pass out from the

1875.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
heat every now and then and nobody will

1877.2 --> 1879.8400000000001
notice

1880.88 --> 1888.0
or just go under sit in the shadow

1884.96 --> 1890.48
with the wind on the roof somewhere and

1888.0 --> 1892.48
cool off for real

1890.48 --> 1894.799
because even with this thing here it's

1892.48 --> 1896.72
still just extremely hot only this

1894.799 --> 1907.84
helps prevent me from constantly

1896.72 --> 1907.84
sweating in my own eyes

1933.679 --> 1952.72
okay some rats

1949.039 --> 1952.72
hey drunken bullet 411

1957.44 --> 1962.88
yeah it's a flat earther early bird show

1959.32 --> 1966.72
drunkenbold411 you should know that

1962.88 --> 1969.0200000000002
and when it's extremely hot and it is

1966.72 --> 1972.7
then yeah i'll probably be shirtless

1969.02 --> 1972.7
[Music]

1974.0 --> 1991.84
because it's 30 degrees

1977.279 --> 1991.84
celsius right now here

1996.48 --> 2005.84
10 degrees celsius here wow that's

2001.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
where are you then

2038.96 --> 2042.32
all right yeah amanda young yeah she she

2041.12 --> 2045.4399999999998
did she said

2042.32 --> 2047.12
she wanted to come on my show i i would

2045.44 --> 2049.2000000000003
be okay with it except that

2047.12 --> 2050.96
yeah i don't know when i'm here all

2049.2 --> 2052.72
shirtless it kind of feels weird having

2050.96 --> 2061.839
guests on

2052.72 --> 2061.839
lady gaga

2065.2 --> 2071.04
you could build an air conditioner yeah

2067.839 --> 2071.04
by the literalist but

2071.44 --> 2075.839
put an ice

2076.639 --> 2079.04
uh

2079.76 --> 2083.44
yeah i don't have any of that equipment

2081.76 --> 2084.7200000000003
i never even had a fan i'm just

2083.44 --> 2088.48
borrowing this from

2084.72 --> 2091.7599999999998
from a roommate and

2088.48 --> 2093.76
yeah i don't have the money for like a

2091.76 --> 2094.5600000000004
real air conditioner and i think that if

2093.76 --> 2096.639
i did

2094.56 --> 2097.839
that my landlord would not appreciate

2096.639 --> 2101.119
that at all because

2097.839 --> 2101.7599999999998
those things like really eat electricity

2101.119 --> 2104.56
like a

2101.76 --> 2104.5600000000004
like a maniac

2108.32 --> 2111.92
like my computer already uses up quite a

2110.88 --> 2115.44
lot of electricity

2111.92 --> 2118.56
running well half the day

2115.44 --> 2118.56
every single day so

2127.839 --> 2132.48
but yeah i got all kinds of cooling

2130.0 --> 2134.8
things that i can do i got drinks

2132.48 --> 2137.119
i got a foot bath although i didn't get

2134.8 --> 2139.44
one today i got this fan

2137.119 --> 2141.599
i got a good place on the roof in the

2139.44 --> 2143.359
shadow that's actually kind of cool even

2141.599 --> 2146.4
if it's extremely hot

2143.359 --> 2150.3199999999997
so yeah i'll be all right but

2146.4 --> 2152.48
if it's just above 30 degrees celsius

2150.32 --> 2159.839
it's it's still gonna be too hot to wear

2152.48 --> 2159.839
a t-shirt even if it is a wise t-shirt

2163.28 --> 2166.88
ice in front of a fan

2167.04 --> 2171.68
now i think if you would do that in this

2170.32 --> 2174.56
weather

2171.68 --> 2175.52
it that ice is just gonna melt extremely

2174.56 --> 2187.839
fast

2175.52 --> 2187.839
like really really fast

2196.48 --> 2203.76
well i do have like cooling elements

2200.32 --> 2207.2000000000003
in the freezer i might

2203.76 --> 2207.76
try that although it's going to be a bit

2207.2 --> 2210.3199999999997
tricky

2207.76 --> 2211.119
just aiming it right you know this fan

2210.32 --> 2214.48
thing

2211.119 --> 2216.8
doesn't exactly have a big place

2214.48 --> 2217.92
in which it actually blows the air it's

2216.8 --> 2222.0
really like a

2217.92 --> 2226.079
very directed beam so i'd have to yeah

2222.0 --> 2226.079
build something to suspend it

2227.76 --> 2230.8
i don't know but it's a funny idea i

2230.32 --> 2234.079
don't know

2230.8 --> 2238.96
who knows i might try that

2234.079 --> 2238.96
yeah that would be all right

2240.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
swamp cooler what

2256.32 --> 2260.079
hey dr rukovsky

2267.76 --> 2275.76
okay i get it

2271.76 --> 2277.6800000000003
i get it a million ways to cool off and

2275.76 --> 2279.599
the internet is all full of it all you

2277.68 --> 2281.7599999999998
have to do is

2279.599 --> 2286.2400000000002
get stuff together build something and

2281.76 --> 2286.2400000000002
you have it i get it thanks

2290.24 --> 2294.3199999999997
i'm not gonna buy anything though and i

2293.119 --> 2299.359
don't really have

2294.32 --> 2303.04
the things to build anything properly so

2299.359 --> 2305.839
missed fans you have seen them

2303.04 --> 2305.839
very interesting

2307.839 --> 2311.2799999999997
on the other hand i think yeah having a

2310.079 --> 2313.2000000000003
missed fan here

2311.28 --> 2316.2400000000002
like with electronics running and all

2313.2 --> 2327.839
that i don't think it will be too great

2316.24 --> 2327.839
for just the uh for the equipment

2338.839 --> 2341.839
so

2356.32 --> 2362.32
ah you took the words off my keyboard

2359.839 --> 2362.32
all right

2363.119 --> 2366.32
well you know it's not even that it's

2365.599 --> 2369.599
like oh

2366.32 --> 2371.76
you would get like a shock or something

2369.599 --> 2373.599
no it's just that if there's a lot of

2371.76 --> 2376.079
moist going around

2373.599 --> 2378.0
especially when it's hot it's going to

2376.079 --> 2381.76
literally erode

2378.0 --> 2384.88
it's going to basically rust

2381.76 --> 2387.0400000000004
and the likes the computer

2384.88 --> 2388.1600000000003
so it's yeah it's not good for the

2387.04 --> 2391.599
computer to have it

2388.16 --> 2391.5989999999997
have it around in a lot of mice

2392.0 --> 2397.76
so don't expect to be shocked you'd

2395.52 --> 2399.119
really have to over kill the miss then

2397.76 --> 2404.1600000000003
that it's literally gonna

2399.119 --> 2404.1600000000003
do on everything that's a lot of mist

2405.99 --> 2412.0789999999997
[Music]

2409.04 --> 2414.8
all right be careful with the caps there

2412.079 --> 2414.8
drunken bullet

2415.52 --> 2419.2
and yeah i am preaching to the choir

2417.2 --> 2425.839
that's typically what i do

2419.2 --> 2425.839
you guys are the choir

2436.839 --> 2439.839
so

2451.599 --> 2458.48
what oh that makes sense

2455.52 --> 2459.7599999999998
i think somebody saying it's a sphere is

2458.48 --> 2464.16
not a flat earther

2459.76 --> 2467.8390000000004
not a real nor a fake one yeah the

2464.16 --> 2467.839
yeah that makes sense

2468.4 --> 2473.04
you want a sailboat yeah

2471.44 --> 2474.96
on this kind of weather that's just

2473.04 --> 2477.2799999999997
great

2474.96 --> 2478.079
and there's a lot of boats passing by

2477.28 --> 2480.96
like

2478.079 --> 2483.2000000000003
all the time it's a lot of people just

2480.96 --> 2485.68
going around in their boats

2483.2 --> 2490.16
most of them are motorized though or

2485.68 --> 2490.16
well every single one to be more precise

2491.2 --> 2496.3999999999996
although i bet that some of them could

2493.28 --> 2498.1600000000003
have sails installed on them

2496.4 --> 2501.119
but most people just have motorized

2498.16 --> 2501.1189999999997
boats these days

2502.4 --> 2506.56
but yeah sailing like on a lake i've

2505.359 --> 2509.2
done that in the past

2506.56 --> 2510.24
that's really fascinating sailing and

2509.2 --> 2513.5989999999997
surfing

2510.24 --> 2515.839
done some surfing as well

2513.599 --> 2517.92
my brother was a lot into surfing and i

2515.839 --> 2521.04
kind of like

2517.92 --> 2523.2000000000003
learned from him a bit of it

2521.04 --> 2525.04
and hey it's mostly balance so yeah

2523.2 --> 2527.04
that's totally down my lane i can

2525.04 --> 2529.119
definitely do it because i have an

2527.04 --> 2531.119
excellent balance skill i just have to

2529.119 --> 2534.4
figure out how it works and then

2531.119 --> 2536.88
i catch on really quick when it concerns

2534.4 --> 2536.88
balance

2548.839 --> 2553.7599999999998
skills

2551.119 --> 2554.96
surfing on the lake well yeah it all

2553.76 --> 2558.079
depends

2554.96 --> 2559.2
on what type of weather it is if there

2558.079 --> 2560.8
is some wind

2559.2 --> 2562.64
like if it's completely wind still it's

2560.8 --> 2564.079
kind of useless but if there is wind and

2562.64 --> 2567.2
it's not too strong

2564.079 --> 2570.96
a lake can be great you know there's

2567.2 --> 2570.96
there's not going to be any waves

2572.72 --> 2575.839
so you can just keep on going

2574.54 --> 2579.04
[Music]

2575.839 --> 2580.7999999999997
and make quite a lot of speed my brother

2579.04 --> 2584.48
used to make so much speed that

2580.8 --> 2587.44
literally he would just like a

2584.48 --> 2590.0
speedboat start bouncing off you know

2587.44 --> 2591.92
bouncing off the water like that

2590.0 --> 2594.24
because he was just going so incredibly

2591.92 --> 2594.2400000000002
fast

2595.359 --> 2607.839
it's kind of dangerous though

2619.92 --> 2637.44
would you want to fake being crazy

2634.16 --> 2640.64
no i meant surfing on a

2637.44 --> 2642.96
board that's right it was pretty strong

2640.64 --> 2646.319
winds

2642.96 --> 2649.52
and he went just incredibly fast

2646.319 --> 2651.68
you literally start bouncing

2649.52 --> 2652.8
yeah just like a speedboat but it wasn't

2651.68 --> 2656.7999999999997
motorized at all

2652.8 --> 2659.8390000000004
oh okay

appreciate that

2701.119 --> 2709.599
you need a leash or awake to surf on

2704.72 --> 2709.5989999999997

yeah you guys have been very generous

2726.96 --> 2730.2400000000002
with the pay pals i don't mention them

2728.88 --> 2734.6400000000003
anymore for

2730.24 --> 2736.64
i guess judicial reasons or whatever

2734.64 --> 2738.319
yeah with the super chat yeah it's no

2736.64 --> 2746.72
use not mentioning it because it's all

2738.319 --> 2749.04
going to go on record anyway

2746.72 --> 2749.839
but yeah no the the the support has been

2749.04 --> 2753.119
great i just

2749.839 --> 2756.16
wish i'd get more people

2753.119 --> 2758.48
to to chime in but hey

2756.16 --> 2759.2
you know i already get plenty of support

2758.48 --> 2762.48
compared to

2759.2 --> 2766.0789999999997
a lot of other people and yeah

2762.48 --> 2766.96
i i am not even that specialized in

2766.079 --> 2768.6400000000003
flatter

2766.96 --> 2772.0
what am i talking about i'm i'm a

2768.64 --> 2773.7599999999998
freaking cosmogonical theorist but

2772.0 --> 2775.119
at the issue i don't really talk about

2773.76 --> 2777.6800000000003
that all day long

2775.119 --> 2777.6800000000003
every day

2779.68 --> 2789.839
but yeah anyway

2806.319 --> 2811.92
right good one kim robinson if you can

2808.72 --> 2811.9199999999996
be anything be kind

2812.0 --> 2816.88
i always like the word kind added you

2814.96 --> 2819.68
know there's

2816.88 --> 2822.96
there's no bad way you can interpret the

2819.68 --> 2822.96
word kind in any way

2823.359 --> 2828.96
i even like the word mankind

2826.48 --> 2828.96
at it

2829.599 --> 2835.28
because it kind of implies the kind the

2832.72 --> 2835.2799999999997
kindness

2836.24 --> 2840.0789999999997
i know it can also be interpreted as

2838.72 --> 2842.8799999999997
like the species

2840.079 --> 2844.559
mankind blue species of man does it

2842.88 --> 2844.96
really mean that or is that something

2844.559 --> 2847.3590000000004
they

2844.96 --> 2849.119
made out of it is that another

2847.359 --> 2852.5589999999997
transmutation of words

2849.119 --> 2852.559
from the eugenics roots

2852.96 --> 2860.88
did it not just mean

2856.24 --> 2865.839
the gentle folk the gentle man

2860.88 --> 2865.839
woman kind nah i'm not going with that

2868.559 --> 2873.52
but hey you know man can do without

2871.2 --> 2873.52
women

2880.079 --> 2886.88
we would all yeah we yes

2883.92 --> 2887.76
mankind would end pretty quickly if it

2886.88 --> 2891.44
wasn't for

2887.76 --> 2891.44
women so

2892.24 --> 2896.9599999999996
i don't think yeah i don't feel the need

2894.96 --> 2899.44
to basically

2896.96 --> 2901.359
make everything some kind of uniformity

2899.44 --> 2903.68
you know that's

2901.359 --> 2903.68
again

2907.2 --> 2910.5589999999997
we all know what where it eventually

2909.04 --> 2914.07
leads it's just a

2910.559 --> 2917.1090000000004
a directive and it always leads

2914.07 --> 2917.1090000000004
[Music]

2917.28 --> 2924.559
to things where we don't want to go

2921.119 --> 2929.76
eventually even if it starts out great

2924.559 --> 2931.2000000000003
if it starts out good it's

2929.76 --> 2934.48
it's better to just make a clear

2931.2 --> 2937.68
distinction i think

2934.48 --> 2940.319
prevent all the craziness out there

2937.68 --> 2943.839
but um yeah i'm kind of like really

2940.319 --> 2943.839
old-fashioned that way i guess

2950.72 --> 2956.8799999999997
right eyes right shut yeah exactly

2953.92 --> 2957.52
you know i always want to emphasize yeah

2956.88 --> 2961.359
man

2957.52 --> 2964.64
woman very different yet

2961.359 --> 2966.319
they definitely need each other

2964.64 --> 2969.359
even though they drive each other nuts

2966.319 --> 2971.92
sometimes it's all part of the challenge

2969.359 --> 2973.92
do they really drive each other nuts or

2971.92 --> 2977.04
is it

2973.92 --> 2979.52
that they drive each other

2977.04 --> 2985.04
to drive themselves nuts you know it's

2979.52 --> 2988.319
about the confrontation

2985.04 --> 2991.04
even in relationships if my lady

2988.319 --> 2992.5589999999997
was in a certain mood trying to drive me

2991.04 --> 2995.359
nuts

2992.559 --> 2997.28
then yeah you could blame it all on her

2995.359 --> 2999.359
like oh she's getting all nutty

2997.28 --> 3001.28
or you could just see the situation for

2999.359 --> 3002.72
what it is and that she's actually kind

3001.28 --> 3006.8
of like

3002.72 --> 3010.7999999999997
trying to break me because she's

3006.8 --> 3012.88
like dissatisfied with something

3010.8 --> 3014.7200000000003
then it's up to me to figure out what

3012.88 --> 3018.319
that is get to the problem

3014.72 --> 3022.0789999999997
find the middle way through and just

3018.319 --> 3022.079
solve it to break that

3023.04 --> 3030.24
that need of hers to basically do that

3027.119 --> 3030.559
see like within relations i've always

3030.24 --> 3033.2799999999997
been

3030.559 --> 3034.0
very very forthcoming like too

3033.28 --> 3037.28
forthcoming

3034.0 --> 3040.559
for comfort for most of my girlfriends

3037.28 --> 3042.4
like i'm too i'm like

3040.559 --> 3044.0
almost like yeah you want a relation

3042.4 --> 3047.6800000000003
with me that means

3044.0 --> 3050.079
we are now almost like a a secret empire

3047.68 --> 3052.0
together

3050.079 --> 3054.319
i have so much to share and there's so

3052.0 --> 3054.88
much to safeguard and i need to trust

3054.319 --> 3058.72
you

3054.88 --> 3062.8
to the maximum possibility

3058.72 --> 3065.68
and can you handle that well

3062.8 --> 3066.079
answer is no i really haven't come

3065.68 --> 3068.96
across

3066.079 --> 3071.52
anyone that could so far but i was

3068.96 --> 3071.52
willing to

3073.359 --> 3083.839
but yeah it's been a while since i even

3075.04 --> 3083.839
tried last

3089.2 --> 3093.2799999999997
how did i end up talking about

3090.48 --> 3097.839
relationships again sheesh

3093.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
must be the heat

3099.559 --> 3106.559
thermonuclear experimental reactor

3102.72 --> 3111.839
what international

3106.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
what does that mean thermal nuclear

3117.2 --> 3125.839
that just sounds just like a regular

3121.52 --> 3127.68
uh nuclear reactor and a koala

3125.839 --> 3130.0
are you sure you didn't mean like the

3127.68 --> 3131.359
the fusion reactor

3130.0 --> 3138.16
because they're supposed to be like a

3131.359 --> 3140.48
fusion reactor too

3138.16 --> 3142.24
been hearing about that thing being

3140.48 --> 3144.8
built for a long time i have no

3142.24 --> 3146.9599999999996
idea if that was ever real if anything

3144.8 --> 3147.92
about that was ever real or if it was a

3146.96 --> 3151.44
completely

3147.92 --> 3153.76
fake cover story it wasn't just another

3151.44 --> 3155.92
nasa-like fake technical project that

3153.76 --> 3158.1600000000003
people are working on then they hand

3155.92 --> 3160.88
over their works to the next layer who

3158.16 --> 3162.8799999999997
basically make the cover story

3160.88 --> 3164.48
in order for the wider public to believe

3162.88 --> 3165.599
that that is going on even though it's

3164.48 --> 3168.079
not going on

3165.599 --> 3169.2000000000003
just like with all the satellites all of

3168.079 --> 3172.7200000000003
them every

3169.2 --> 3175.52
single freaking one all fake

3172.72 --> 3176.16
so yeah if they do that sort of thing i

3175.52 --> 3178.96
think that

3176.16 --> 3180.64
there's going to be more technologies

3178.96 --> 3183.92
that are going to be pumped out as

3180.64 --> 3187.04
being done which are just literally

3183.92 --> 3190.559
not happening at all

3187.04 --> 3193.68
one of them then of course is the

3190.559 --> 3196.48
the big cyclotron this is called again

3193.68 --> 3196.48
you know the one

3197.2 --> 3203.5989999999997
the big thing forget the name

3200.48 --> 3206.839
but yeah that thing is completely

3203.599 --> 3210.8
and utterly fake it just doesn't do

3206.839 --> 3212.88
anything that they say it does or

3210.8 --> 3214.6400000000003
at least not it doesn't produce the

3212.88 --> 3216.96
things that they

3214.64 --> 3218.8799999999997
seem to get out of it it's more like

3216.96 --> 3222.8
this weird

3218.88 --> 3226.96
magnetic device they yeah

3222.8 --> 3227.6800000000003
they do some minutes particle crashing

3226.96 --> 3230.559
[ __ ]

3227.68 --> 3233.52
and then they start to divine what the

3230.559 --> 3235.3590000000004
[ __ ] that's supposed to mean with math

3233.52 --> 3236.88
a bunch of lines and they're gonna

3235.359 --> 3241.359
divine oh this means a

3236.88 --> 3243.839
pattern the giant preponderance of works

3241.359 --> 3246.0789999999997
of presupposition and what it means

3243.839 --> 3248.0
the divination that's what it is it's

3246.079 --> 3249.8390000000004
the only thing it ever was

3248.0 --> 3252.559
because it doesn't do anything else it

3249.839 --> 3255.2799999999997
definitely does not reveal

3252.559 --> 3256.2400000000002
any fundamental particle and it never

3255.28 --> 3259.6800000000003
will

3256.24 --> 3262.319
you can't you can't do it with it

3259.68 --> 3263.04
it's completely [ __ ] all science

3262.319 --> 3265.839
fiction

3263.04 --> 3265.839
garbage

3268.16 --> 3272.96
so yeah is the fusion energy thing real

3270.96 --> 3274.96
i've seen like a photograph of a

3272.96 --> 3276.0
supposed inner chamber it looked very

3274.96 --> 3277.839
high techy

3276.0 --> 3279.68
but yeah then again you know i've seen

3277.839 --> 3282.64
plenty of movies with that sort of [ __ ]

3279.68 --> 3293.839
as well so does that mean that it's real

3282.64 --> 3293.839
no doesn't mean that at all

3300.079 --> 3307.52
being in france makes it open to attack

3303.04 --> 3321.839
what does that mean

3307.52 --> 3321.839
attack from who

3324.39 --> 3327.6
[Music]

3332.839 --> 3335.839
um

3344.88 --> 3348.48
the cube worshipers are you kidding me

3347.04 --> 3352.079
there is no place safe

3348.48 --> 3352.64
on earth for the cube worshippers not a

3352.079 --> 3355.2000000000003
place

3352.64 --> 3355.2
on earth

3359.119 --> 3366.319
they are literally literally

3362.48 --> 3370.16
everywhere everywhere

3366.319 --> 3370.16
no place on earth without them

3374.799 --> 3378.0
if they're gonna blow something up

3376.16 --> 3381.1189999999997
they're gonna blow something up

3378.0 --> 3381.839
problem is you don't know you know if

3381.119 --> 3384.1600000000003
anything

3381.839 --> 3386.48
if anything diffusion reactor would be

3384.16 --> 3387.2799999999997
blown off by a terrorist attack oh my

3386.48 --> 3389.839
god

3387.28 --> 3390.4
all the billions oh no it's all for

3389.839 --> 3391.839
nothing

3390.4 --> 3393.92
well guess what you know what that could

3391.839 --> 3396.799
have been

3393.92 --> 3398.319
nothing an empty building with some

3396.799 --> 3400.799
trash being blown up with

3398.319 --> 3401.68
high explosive and all the money all

3400.799 --> 3404.079
being

3401.68 --> 3405.68
funneled away into nothing there was

3404.079 --> 3407.6800000000003
nothing ever there

3405.68 --> 3410.64
but they're definitely gonna use it to

3407.68 --> 3412.8799999999997
claim oh my god the damage look at all

3410.64 --> 3414.64
the tax money that was destroyed because

3412.88 --> 3415.359
of the terrorist attack we got to

3414.64 --> 3419.68
declare

3415.359 --> 3423.5989999999997
war now right

3419.68 --> 3426.319
now that's some cube [ __ ] right there

3423.599 --> 3426.96
that's what they do they're not gonna

3426.319 --> 3430.4
blow up

3426.96 --> 3431.52
anything real no no no but they want you

3430.4 --> 3434.48
to think

3431.52 --> 3436.88
that they do because what's better than

3434.48 --> 3439.68
to build something that doesn't exist

3436.88 --> 3441.839
takes a huge amount of money and then

3439.68 --> 3442.5589999999997
you basically hide that it never even

3441.839 --> 3445.839
existed

3442.559 --> 3447.6800000000003
by blowing it up and then using it as a

3445.839 --> 3451.04
political excuse

3447.68 --> 3453.2
to do more damage take more control ruin

3451.04 --> 3456.4
more lives

3453.2 --> 3461.839
get more money sources more slavery

3456.4 --> 3461.839
that's what they do so

3462.16 --> 3466.319
i'm gonna destroy actual value

3469.119 --> 3472.48
it's the only thing they even care about

3471.44 --> 3474.96
they're not gonna destroy

3472.48 --> 3477.599
actual value they just want it for

3474.96 --> 3477.599
themselves

3478.16 --> 3483.5989999999997
and one of the best ways in this age in

3481.44 --> 3486.2400000000002
the age of illusions is by making

3483.599 --> 3488.2400000000002
something up fantastical

3486.24 --> 3489.839
get a conspiracy to keep it a secret

3488.24 --> 3493.5989999999997
keep it in the black box

3489.839 --> 3496.319
keep it mystic make people pay for it

3493.599 --> 3498.2400000000002
create the virtual existence of it so

3496.319 --> 3500.64
that all people believe it's real

3498.24 --> 3503.5989999999997
and then destroy it and then blaming

3500.64 --> 3507.04
something out there for destroying it

3503.599 --> 3510.799
and you got another thing you can do

3507.04 --> 3510.799
thanks to something that never was even

3514.839 --> 3517.839
there

3520.079 --> 3531.8390000000004
that's called efficiency

3545.2 --> 3550.0
i don't even know why we're calling him

3546.88 --> 3552.799

3550.0 --> 3552.799
by this point

3555.119 --> 3560.6400000000003
but yeah it is kind of a thing it's more

3557.68 --> 3560.64
like a metaphor

3570.72 --> 3576.24
well it seems nathan is not

3573.839 --> 3576.24
live

3576.88 --> 3587.839
what a bummer

don't do that amanda

3668.839 --> 3674.0789999999997
hmm

3670.319 --> 3677.119
right maybe i'll check out discord

3674.079 --> 3677.119
what's going on in there

3681.28 --> 3686.0
just to take a look though oh god it's

3684.079 --> 3689.119
updating

3686.0 --> 3689.119

well drunken bullet for one to reach

3740.72 --> 3746.16
their own

you may think that nathan teabagging

3746.16 --> 3750.64
absolute [ __ ] globers is not really

3749.2 --> 3752.72
worth your time well there's a lot of

3750.64 --> 3754.64
people that really do think it's worth

3752.72 --> 3757.1189999999997
their time

3754.64 --> 3759.0389999999998
i for one am one of these people at

3757.119 --> 3762.0
times

3759.039 --> 3762.7990000000004
because they get really on my nerves a

3762.0 --> 3765.119
lot of the time

3762.799 --> 3767.599
i don't show it i'm not gonna give them

3765.119 --> 3770.6400000000003
the satisfaction of it

3767.599 --> 3771.44
and i want somebody to metaphorically

3770.64 --> 3774.0789999999997
bash their

3771.44 --> 3775.119
face in every now and then to make them

3774.079 --> 3778.1600000000003
really

3775.119 --> 3778.1600000000003
really feel it

3778.24 --> 3781.52
so yeah i find it very satisfying you

3780.64 --> 3784.799
may not like it

3781.52 --> 3787.17
i do i'm not always for

3784.799 --> 3790.369
in the mood for that by the way but

3787.17 --> 3790.369
[Music]

3795.52 --> 3797.839
all right

3812.64 --> 3815.0389999999998
okay

3815.92 --> 3819.76
well there's a few people in there

3823.359 --> 3825.5989999999997
hmm

3830.799 --> 3839.839
no i didn't just seem to be hanging

3832.4 --> 3839.839
around no big players

3856.48 --> 3860.16
yeah stairs moretz yeah he is

3863.039 --> 3868.1600000000003
he is condescending definitely

3866.319 --> 3871.2
but yeah most of the time it's very

3868.16 --> 3871.2
deservedly so

3873.68 --> 3877.7599999999998
you know there's another group typically

3876.4 --> 3880.4
involved that is

3877.76 --> 3881.92
generally very condescending as well you

3880.4 --> 3883.6800000000003
might have heard of them they're called

3881.92 --> 3886.559
ballers

3883.68 --> 3886.5589999999997
so yeah

3887.28 --> 3894.2400000000002
it's basically shoving a cookie in their

3889.599 --> 3897.119
face of their own dough

3894.24 --> 3899.7599999999998
now sometimes unfortunately he also

3897.119 --> 3901.52
redirects that condescendingness towards

3899.76 --> 3904.7200000000003
me for example

3901.52 --> 3908.96
but it's usually has more to do with

3904.72 --> 3911.0389999999998
just personal mood

3908.96 --> 3913.039
because he has been overall very

3911.039 --> 3916.1600000000003
gracious to me

3913.039 --> 3916.88
beside those moments and he shouts me

3916.16 --> 3919.2
out a lot

3916.88 --> 3920.88
and gives me a lot of credit even though

3919.2 --> 3923.839
i do actually deserve some of that

3920.88 --> 3923.839
credit

3924.0 --> 3928.319
but yeah you know that doesn't mean that

3925.92 --> 3929.76
you're going to get it from people

3928.319 --> 3932.4
how many other people have actually

3929.76 --> 3934.7200000000003
given me credit or even mentioned my

3932.4 --> 3934.7200000000003
name

3935.599 --> 3940.48
without me being there for example it

3938.24 --> 3941.1189999999997
seems like a whole swath of people out

3940.48 --> 3944.079
there are

3941.119 --> 3945.92
literally like censoring my name by

3944.079 --> 3949.2000000000003
personal decision they're just

3945.92 --> 3953.119
never mentioning me ever because

3949.2 --> 3954.16
i'm a nobody you know i live on social

3953.119 --> 3958.319
welfare

3954.16 --> 3961.2
i only have 1.75k subscribers

3958.319 --> 3962.16
you know i have mood swings no i'm not

3961.2 --> 3966.3999999999996
worthy

3962.16 --> 3969.7599999999998
so you know it's not like i completely

3966.4 --> 3972.48
created a wide oversight over all the

3969.76 --> 3975.5200000000004
possibilities of cosmogeny

3972.48 --> 3977.44
laid out extremely early on

3975.52 --> 3979.839
that the heavenly bodies are all

3977.44 --> 3980.559
holographic and not physical literal

3979.839 --> 3984.64
items

3980.559 --> 3987.2000000000003
in the sky right

3984.64 --> 3988.5589999999997
basically pointed out not as early on

3987.2 --> 3990.319
but early on enough

3988.559 --> 3992.2400000000002
that the sun is not the cause of the

3990.319 --> 3993.0389999999998
daylight that's actually more recent

3992.24 --> 3995.1189999999997
discovery

3993.039 --> 3997.5200000000004
and all that but yeah who's gonna give

3995.119 --> 3998.2400000000002
me credit because i'm no one i'm in no

3997.52 --> 4000.4
one

3998.24 --> 4002.0789999999997
they are much higher subscribers than me

4000.4 --> 4006.1600000000003
they make more money than me

4002.079 --> 4010.319
they think they're a lot better than me

4006.16 --> 4010.319
because that's how they act overall

4011.039 --> 4014.7200000000003
and yeah so why would you then mention

4013.599 --> 4020.48
me

4014.72 --> 4022.799
you know

4020.48 --> 4024.4
it's better to just avoid me than just

4022.799 --> 4026.0
not talk about me talk about other

4024.4 --> 4027.839
blabblers out there that you

4026.0 --> 4029.2
just bumped into and they're all that

4027.839 --> 4031.44
great oh it's fresh

4029.2 --> 4034.0
it's fresh and new a new person that's

4031.44 --> 4038.0
just great

4034.0 --> 4042.0
you know i don't care man

4038.0 --> 4048.4
if they don't like me let's screw them

4042.0 --> 4052.88
that's the truth of it anyway

4048.4 --> 4052.88
i'm not part of any club

4053.599 --> 4060.0
i'm part of a crew i work i work for

4056.64 --> 4060.0
people that i respect

4061.119 --> 4069.2000000000003
and i hope to not be super poor

4064.88 --> 4072.2400000000002
on top of that but yeah i'm not part of

4069.2 --> 4072.24
anyone's club

4073.039 --> 4077.5200000000004
i don't like this club formation people

4076.319 --> 4080.799
like oh oh

4077.52 --> 4083.359
we are this group and the rest

4080.799 --> 4084.24
is outsiders because they don't think

4083.359 --> 4087.2799999999997
and talk like

4084.24 --> 4092.319
us or oh these people

4087.28 --> 4097.76
are too strict they don't allow us to

4092.319 --> 4097.76
have to reify a model into literalness

4102.839 --> 4107.679
oh

4104.08 --> 4107.679
not saying that everybody's doing that

4107.839 --> 4112.0
but they certainly don't like it do they

4116.719 --> 4120.0
they don't like it when people point out

4118.719 --> 4121.839
like no

4120.0 --> 4124.4
you're fooling around and you're just

4121.839 --> 4128.3189999999995
doing it wrong

4124.4 --> 4131.679
and you're still over responding to past

4128.319 --> 4133.759
global reactions which are just straight

4131.679 --> 4136.96
out attacks no matter what

4133.759 --> 4139.12
but yeah if somebody on flat earth side

4136.96 --> 4140.64
is giving you legitimate criticism maybe

4139.12 --> 4142.88
even getting a little pissed off

4140.64 --> 4144.0
that does not mean it's okay to just

4142.88 --> 4147.279
ignore it all

4144.0 --> 4150.159
or to be like oh he's a nobody

4147.279 --> 4151.52
oh let's not talk about him let's just

4150.159 --> 4153.44
keep on blabbering

4151.52 --> 4155.120000000001
about total [ __ ] and confirmed

4153.44 --> 4159.678999999999
[ __ ]

4155.12 --> 4161.679
you know more masks politics

4159.679 --> 4165.839
and like really talking about it not

4161.679 --> 4165.839
just mentioning something quickly

4166.159 --> 4177.04
it's more important you know

4174.64 --> 4178.159000000001
yeah i know still in 8012 but it is a

4177.04 --> 4180.88
critical

4178.159 --> 4180.879999999999
cornerstone

4181.6 --> 4184.88
and there is more work to be done

4183.759 --> 4188.0
cosmogeny

4184.88 --> 4192.64
figuring out what it is and not just

4188.0 --> 4196.08
reifying one singular model

4192.64 --> 4199.4400000000005
with all kinds of literalness like oh

4196.08 --> 4201.84
it must be a disk because

4199.44 --> 4204.4
electricity and magnetism it's the only

4201.84 --> 4208.0
way we understand it can even work and

4204.4 --> 4211.28
uh so it must be that because we don't

4208.0 --> 4213.36
understand how it could work otherwise

4211.28 --> 4215.199
right yeah that seemed to be a universal

4213.36 --> 4220.5599999999995
problem

4215.199 --> 4220.5599999999995
a lot of uh flat earthers out there

4221.76 --> 4225.1990000000005
yeah and that's and it's not a victory

4223.76 --> 4231.84
for ballers either

4225.199 --> 4231.839999999999
it's just a really bad habit

4244.239 --> 4248.5599999999995
time is money dedication and consistency

4246.08 --> 4252.64
deserves rewards i certainly hope so

4248.56 --> 4254.88
otherwise i'd be yeah i am giving a lot

4252.64 --> 4254.88
here

4255.52 --> 4260.0
now the alternative is to do something

4258.159 --> 4262.4
completely different and give a lot of

4260.0 --> 4264.56
energy to things that i don't like doing

4262.4 --> 4266.48
at all and that i don't have a lot of

4264.56 --> 4268.320000000001
intellectual things that i can

4266.48 --> 4272.0
contribute to without people

4268.32 --> 4275.679
telling me stop doing that you're making

4272.0 --> 4278.239
me look bad yeah that [ __ ]

4275.679 --> 4280.0
been haunting my life all just from the

4278.239 --> 4282.48
beginning

4280.0 --> 4283.44
stop being so good at this you're just a

4282.48 --> 4285.44
stupid temp

4283.44 --> 4289.919999999999
you're not supposed to improve the

4285.44 --> 4289.919999999999
system you just walked into in an hour

4291.84 --> 4295.04
right so yeah i am doing that that's

4294.159 --> 4297.679
exactly

4295.04 --> 4299.12
what i do i'm doing it right here and i

4297.679 --> 4301.12
don't have anybody

4299.12 --> 4303.599999999999
that's my boss telling me that i'm gonna

4301.12 --> 4305.92
do that or it's making him look bad

4303.6 --> 4306.64
except maybe some of the flat earth

4305.92 --> 4309.52
debaters

4306.64 --> 4311.52
and hey i do get into trouble there and

4309.52 --> 4313.679
i do apologize and then i get into

4311.52 --> 4315.360000000001
trouble again and i don't apologize for

4313.679 --> 4317.679
it because i'm just saying like you do

4315.36 --> 4318.719
just freaking deal with it this is how i

4317.679 --> 4321.92
work

4318.719 --> 4324.159
it's worth it it's worth sitting through

4321.92 --> 4324.159
that

4324.64 --> 4328.56
just take it you just like you take

4327.84 --> 4331.12
kiwi's

4328.56 --> 4332.8
[ __ ] and he has some [ __ ] definitely if

4331.12 --> 4334.159
you can take that you can definitely

4332.8 --> 4342.08
take mine

4334.159 --> 4344.159
just take it it's worth it

4342.08 --> 4345.199
yeah at that i do have to kind of like

4344.159 --> 4348.5599999999995
more defend

4345.199 --> 4350.799999999999
my unusual

4348.56 --> 4351.76
stance i guess my behavior it's not

4350.8 --> 4354.88
because i think

4351.76 --> 4357.1990000000005
what i do my like my pushy behavior or

4354.88 --> 4360.56
whatever is right it's just because i

4357.199 --> 4364.239
must defend myself to kind of stay

4360.56 --> 4365.679
natural and not be kind of forced in a

4364.239 --> 4367.599999999999
corner where i'm gonna just be

4365.679 --> 4369.6
suppressing myself constantly

4367.6 --> 4371.280000000001
you know that even in the debates of

4369.6 --> 4372.719
latter debates in the beginning like the

4371.28 --> 4374.88
first year

4372.719 --> 4377.92
it was a lot like that for me i felt

4374.88 --> 4380.159000000001
like i had to suppress myself constantly

4377.92 --> 4384.32
i was afraid of peer pressure from flat

4380.159 --> 4386.879999999999
earthers i was

4384.32 --> 4388.96
now i wasn't planning to settle to it

4386.88 --> 4392.08
but it was still there

4388.96 --> 4396.56
and i had to literally just say like

4392.08 --> 4396.5599999999995
yeah i'm going to defy everything

4396.84 --> 4401.6
everything

4399.199 --> 4403.04
there's only one real thing that i'm

4401.6 --> 4406.0
answering to

4403.04 --> 4407.76
and that is the creator and the rules of

4406.0 --> 4411.52
creation

4407.76 --> 4414.96
there's no person that i will not defy

4411.52 --> 4418.56
when it comes to principles

4414.96 --> 4422.719
or thoughts or ideas

4418.56 --> 4425.679
or opinions of how things should be done

4422.719 --> 4426.0
i will always resort back to myself

4425.679 --> 4429.28
because

4426.0 --> 4432.96
i'm eclectic nobody will teach me but me

4429.28 --> 4436.8
but hey people can say great things at

4432.96 --> 4436.8
the right time and it will help me

4437.12 --> 4441.679
so it's not like it's only coming from

4439.04 --> 4445.84
me and nobody's words are gonna matter

4441.679 --> 4449.4400000000005
but nobody can make me do anything

4445.84 --> 4449.4400000000005
unless i want it

4449.679 --> 4454.4800000000005
or unless i accept it because i think

4452.64 --> 4456.4800000000005
it's worth doing that

4454.48 --> 4458.4
because it'll might it might change

4456.48 --> 4459.12
somebody else's attitude for the better

4458.4 --> 4462.239
and that

4459.12 --> 4465.679
bring more constructive room

4462.239 --> 4469.04
so yeah i have been

4465.679 --> 4473.84
basically elbowing and muscling

4469.04 --> 4477.04
for myself to make some room and to just

4473.84 --> 4480.32
put me out there saying yes

4477.04 --> 4481.44
i'm not gonna be pushed away you're not

4480.32 --> 4484.32
gonna do that

4481.44 --> 4486.719
and i don't care if you don't like me if

4484.32 --> 4489.679
you're going to be in a group

4486.719 --> 4490.8
poo pooing irwin even if you're

4489.679 --> 4493.84
supposedly on

4490.8 --> 4495.679
our side the flatter i don't care

4493.84 --> 4497.92
i don't care i don't care over at

4495.679 --> 4498.8
ranties i don't care over at globe

4497.92 --> 4502.719
busters

4498.8 --> 4505.6
i don't care i don't care

4502.719 --> 4506.4
and i don't want your convenient

4505.6 --> 4510.159000000001
trinkets

4506.4 --> 4512.879999999999
either if that's what that means because

4510.159 --> 4516.4
i don't care for bribery

4512.88 --> 4518.64
at all or convenience i don't want to be

4516.4 --> 4519.599999999999
part of a club i just want to do what i

4518.64 --> 4522.4800000000005
can do

4519.6 --> 4524.320000000001
because i want to do it right i don't

4522.48 --> 4526.32
want things to be

4524.32 --> 4528.639999999999
nice for me i'm not looking for this

4526.32 --> 4530.239
convenient ground to just hang around

4528.64 --> 4533.6
and waste everybody's time

4530.239 --> 4534.879999999999
no i'm gonna get crawl in there i'm

4533.6 --> 4538.08
gonna crawl

4534.88 --> 4541.28
straight into hell if i need to

4538.08 --> 4544.199
get it right to figure

4541.28 --> 4553.719999999999
it out for real and not to dwell on

4544.199 --> 4558.299999999999
presuppositional [ __ ]

4553.72 --> 4558.3
[Music]

4564.84 --> 4570.0
hmm

4567.84 --> 4571.04
and at the same time yeah i will damn

4570.0 --> 4574.56
well

4571.04 --> 4577.6
make up make up out of nothing

4574.56 --> 4581.280000000001
i made it up out of nothing

4577.6 --> 4583.719
i will make up fantastical ideas as well

4581.28 --> 4585.5199999999995
far reaching presuppositions certain

4583.719 --> 4589.12
presuppositions that are

4585.52 --> 4591.84
naturally going to be there i will reach

4589.12 --> 4594.159
beyond that in consequences and i will

4591.84 --> 4595.12
come up with some really fantastical

4594.159 --> 4598.08
[ __ ] that'll

4595.12 --> 4599.36
blow my own mind in the spot as i make

4598.08 --> 4602.64
it up

4599.36 --> 4604.32
i will do that but be very clear about

4602.64 --> 4606.64
what it means

4604.32 --> 4608.0
what it really is what it's not i'm not

4606.64 --> 4611.12
going to reify

4608.0 --> 4614.08
any fantastical there into absolute

4611.12 --> 4614.96
reality and works towards that because

4614.08 --> 4618.159
it sounds

4614.96 --> 4621.44
the best because it appeals to the most

4618.159 --> 4622.879999999999
people don't give a [ __ ] i wanna know

4621.44 --> 4625.44
what's real

4622.88 --> 4627.1990000000005
absolutely real even if that means hell

4625.44 --> 4630.32
itself

4627.199 --> 4631.599999999999
i'm gonna find out and nothing's gonna

4630.32 --> 4634.5599999999995
stop me

4631.6 --> 4634.56
except god

4635.12 --> 4638.32
if he even wants to

4641.28 --> 4645.12
nathan is not as real as are we not it's

4643.6 --> 4647.4400000000005
not a a real

4645.12 --> 4649.199
competition okay this is i'm just saying

4647.44 --> 4650.719
this for me

4649.199 --> 4652.719
you know i'm not i don't want a

4650.719 --> 4656.2390000000005
measuring stick

4652.719 --> 4657.199
i'm just real and other people may think

4656.239 --> 4660.32
that they're real

4657.199 --> 4661.44
up to a certain degree but yeah i happen

4660.32 --> 4664.4
to have this

4661.44 --> 4665.919999999999
insane standard that no person in their

4664.4 --> 4669.199
right mind

4665.92 --> 4672.719
most of them are going to do like that

4669.199 --> 4676.0
because people want to have lives

4672.719 --> 4678.88
right so they

4676.0 --> 4681.36
they don't become as fanatical about

4678.88 --> 4681.36
this [ __ ]

4687.679 --> 4693.84
yeah and as for nathan look nathan real

4691.44 --> 4693.839999999999
nathan

4695.6 --> 4699.84
he is what he is he doesn't want to get

4698.88 --> 4702.56
that real

4699.84 --> 4703.76
and at the same time he's super strict

4702.56 --> 4708.080000000001
real

4703.76 --> 4711.1990000000005
when it comes to academics

4708.08 --> 4712.8
very very very real but when it comes to

4711.199 --> 4715.199
i don't know spirituality

4712.8 --> 4717.4400000000005
broader ideas yeah he's colloquial as

4715.199 --> 4719.28
caget he's just a common man

4717.44 --> 4721.44
and he knows it he's very honest about

4719.28 --> 4724.4
it you know you gotta

4721.44 --> 4725.36
you got to appreciate that nathan is

4724.4 --> 4728.08
really honest

4725.36 --> 4729.199
in how he does and sees things as well

4728.08 --> 4731.44
so

4729.199 --> 4732.48
in a way i'd like to dispute that amanda

4731.44 --> 4737.04
you i think nathan

4732.48 --> 4740.239
is pretty real i think he is

4737.04 --> 4742.32
and he's become better you know four

4740.239 --> 4744.959999999999
years ago he had some dubious [ __ ] going

4742.32 --> 4747.199
on sometimes socially

4744.96 --> 4749.199
just he had some weird things that he

4747.199 --> 4751.759999999999
did some real dark [ __ ]

4749.199 --> 4753.28
with words and yeah but a lot of flat

4751.76 --> 4757.12
earthers in the beginning had

4753.28 --> 4760.32
those issues and he really

4757.12 --> 4762.64
he really improved he really did

4760.32 --> 4764.88
he looks better he looks more

4762.64 --> 4766.88
symmetrical even

4764.88 --> 4769.1990000000005
so he's fixed things about himself he's

4766.88 --> 4771.52
worked on himself and it's it's palpable

4769.199 --> 4771.5199999999995
to me

4772.56 --> 4777.280000000001
i respect him a lot more now

4775.679 --> 4779.84
you know back in the day i didn't really

4777.28 --> 4779.84
trust him

4780.159 --> 4783.5199999999995
and i don't think it would have been

4781.36 --> 4786.0
wise to have trusted him back then

4783.52 --> 4788.320000000001
because he just didn't show like he was

4786.0 --> 4789.679
trustworthy at times to me at least i

4788.32 --> 4792.239
don't know i don't know

4789.679 --> 4792.8
it's a long time ago but i think he's

4792.239 --> 4795.678999999999
just

what the [ __ ]

5037.44 --> 5040.5599999999995
that is so messed up

5040.719 --> 5047.84
yeah sorry i'm just watching some

5044.48 --> 5051.12
video apparently from beirut

5047.84 --> 5053.92
it's like a cctv camera

5051.12 --> 5055.5199999999995
security camera that basically digitally

5053.92 --> 5057.52
but yeah the whole place is just

5055.52 --> 5057.92
disintegrated pretty much from what i'm

5057.52 --> 5062.0
seeing

5057.92 --> 5071.84
ugh it's [ __ ] up man

5062.0 --> 5071.84
[ __ ] up

5093.12 --> 5101.84
living up to your name drunk okay

5098.08 --> 5106.159
where are you are you like

5101.84 --> 5113.84
in new zealand or australia or something

5106.159 --> 5113.839999999999
that would make a little bit more sense

5115.12 --> 5117.84
i forgot

5119.679 --> 5127.84
yeah australia i thought so all right

5132.96 --> 5141.84
guns of never own rmp and drunken bullet

5135.84 --> 5141.84
411 yeah

5145.04 --> 5155.84
so yeah

5161.6 --> 5165.84
collection of beirut explosion videos oh

5164.88 --> 5168.08
god

5165.84 --> 5169.28
yeah but there's a lot around just goes

5168.08 --> 5173.199
to show that

5169.28 --> 5173.199
there's plenty of cameras around there

5178.8 --> 5182.0
do you think all aussies are this drunk

5181.44 --> 5184.5599999999995
yeah you

5182.0 --> 5184.56
are right

5186.639 --> 5198.159000000001
i don't know

5196.239 --> 5199.5199999999995
i don't know how it works in australia

5198.159 --> 5203.04
with the alcohol

5199.52 --> 5205.040000000001
but i can imagine that a lot of you

5203.04 --> 5206.08
yeah you like there's a lot of like

5205.04 --> 5209.28
hearty

5206.08 --> 5212.159
muscly sources of humans

5209.28 --> 5212.96
from it being prison colonies and

5212.159 --> 5216.159
farming

5212.96 --> 5217.28
and all that that there's probably heavy

5216.159 --> 5219.839999999999
drinking

5217.28 --> 5220.639
like they would probably drink more

5219.84 --> 5225.84
compared to

5220.639 --> 5225.84
other peoples right

5227.92 --> 5234.2390000000005
so like i take two beers right

5231.44 --> 5235.28
and then probably the typical australian

5234.239 --> 5237.04
that would drink

5235.28 --> 5238.88
if they drink not saying the old drink

5237.04 --> 5240.32
they would they would definitely drink

5238.88 --> 5242.8
an entire crate

5240.32 --> 5244.08
right something like that am i onto

5242.8 --> 5253.1990000000005
something with that or is this

5244.08 --> 5255.36
just nonsense

5253.199 --> 5257.199
how are the coronavirus rates in

5255.36 --> 5260.239
amsterdam zero

5257.199 --> 5261.678999999999

5260.239 --> 5267.839999999999
coronavirus it's all

5261.679 --> 5267.84
[ __ ] all of it

5271.84 --> 5276.639
doesn't cause anything it's an effect

5277.199 --> 5280.239
it's just a condition you can arrive

5279.36 --> 5283.199
into

5280.239 --> 5283.199
doesn't do anything

5288.4 --> 5292.5599999999995
what is the noise it's a fan see this

5291.36 --> 5295.679
thing here

5292.56 --> 5309.84

5323.04 --> 5329.199
censor the word and i say karo

5325.04 --> 5331.84

i determine what the best interest for

5340.88 --> 5344.88

5342.0 --> 5344.88

13 30 right

5431.36 --> 5436.48
thank you very much drunken bullet i

5433.6 --> 5439.360000000001
really appreciate that

5436.48 --> 5439.36
that is gonna help

5442.96 --> 5447.44
yeah zap tappy youtube has been killing

5445.44 --> 5448.48
a lot of channels over it yeah but guess

5447.44 --> 5451.919999999999
what

5448.48 --> 5453.839999999999
those channels make it into you you know

5451.92 --> 5457.4400000000005
how this works right

5453.84 --> 5460.8
it's about traffic specific

5457.44 --> 5461.599999999999
traffic so if somebody is going to make

5460.8 --> 5463.679
a video

5461.6 --> 5464.88
about corona blah blah blah this and

5463.679 --> 5467.4400000000005
that

5464.88 --> 5468.719
and they're making it very specifically

5467.44 --> 5472.32
about that and they put

5468.719 --> 5474.96
all the tactics in there to like

5472.32 --> 5477.599999999999
i am going to get everyone i'm going to

5474.96 --> 5481.36
be famous with this video right

5477.6 --> 5482.96
yeah those videos yeah

5481.36 --> 5484.719
that's how they take away channels

5482.96 --> 5486.88
because they're basically saying

5484.719 --> 5488.4
no you're not allowed to do that you're

5486.88 --> 5490.8
not allowed to break

5488.4 --> 5492.159
out like you're a real doctor or

5490.8 --> 5493.679
something and even if you were a real

5492.159 --> 5494.159
doctor you're still not allowed to do

5493.679 --> 5496.719
that

5494.159 --> 5498.239
because we don't want you to do that it

5496.719 --> 5498.639
doesn't mean that you can't talk about

5498.239 --> 5501.759999999999
it

5498.639 --> 5505.28
are you serious i'd say

5501.76 --> 5508.56
90 percent every

5505.28 --> 5512.239
youtube channel out there 90 percent

5508.56 --> 5514.719
at this point has talked or still

5512.239 --> 5516.4
is currently talking about kuronu

5514.719 --> 5520.96
related nonsense

5516.4 --> 5523.44
in some way societal national protests

5520.96 --> 5524.4800000000005
the medical implications the the side

5523.44 --> 5527.678999999999
effects

5524.48 --> 5532.08
90 and they're going to be blocked

5527.679 --> 5535.76
no of course not it's only the ones

5532.08 --> 5538.239
that really try to weaponize it to

5535.76 --> 5540.08
break out and get like a million

5538.239 --> 5543.28
subscribers or something

5540.08 --> 5546.719
through attention or whatever those

5543.28 --> 5550.08
people yeah those they get like

5546.719 --> 5552.88
swiped off i've meant i talked about it

5550.08 --> 5553.84
i literally have an episode that just

5552.88 --> 5557.1990000000005
says

5553.84 --> 5560.719
it's fake it's there

5557.199 --> 5564.0
they didn't even delete it okay

5560.719 --> 5567.52
you know why because i am not making it

5564.0 --> 5570.56
into this big breakout piece

5567.52 --> 5572.88
separate subject that is going to

5570.56 --> 5576.080000000001
conquer the world and change things no

5572.88 --> 5578.2390000000005
it's just a minor thing in my program

5576.08 --> 5580.5599999999995
i'm just addressing it like everybody

5578.239 --> 5583.5199999999995
else

5580.56 --> 5586.159000000001
so all this hype bro it's gonna delete

5583.52 --> 5586.159000000001
[ __ ]

5586.48 --> 5592.959999999999
just be careful what you're doing it and

5589.76 --> 5596.639
how you're saying it and what claims you

5592.96 --> 5596.96
lay the words you use all of it matters

5596.639 --> 5600.96
this

5596.96 --> 5603.28
is literally a judicial puzzle

5600.96 --> 5606.4800000000005
that's what it is that's the fouchy

5603.28 --> 5610.719
[ __ ] and all this w-h-o

5606.48 --> 5614.5599999999995
it's a judicial puzzle

5610.719 --> 5618.88
that's the only thing it is

5614.56 --> 5621.280000000001
you just gotta realize how it works

5618.88 --> 5623.36
what the real rules are and not the

5621.28 --> 5625.36
rules they flaunt in your face

5623.36 --> 5627.199
that are totally unreasonable and going

5625.36 --> 5630.36
to shut everything down

5627.199 --> 5633.04
right how it really works where the

5630.36 --> 5636.08
responsibilities are

5633.04 --> 5638.48
how it all works and then you can say

5636.08 --> 5639.5199999999995
whatever you like as long as you're not

5638.48 --> 5643.04
going to

5639.52 --> 5646.0
i am going to

5643.04 --> 5647.92
rise up and get all these people to

5646.0 --> 5651.04
protest it right now

5647.92 --> 5652.96
or something you know yeah yeah that

5651.04 --> 5654.88
that's probably gonna get you a strike

5652.96 --> 5658.4
or something

5654.88 --> 5660.88
i'm not doing that just for the record

5658.4 --> 5661.759999999999
but i can damn well freaking tell

5660.88 --> 5664.159000000001
everyone

5661.76 --> 5665.6
what i think it is and what it's not and

5664.159 --> 5669.12
what's really going on

5665.6 --> 5671.76
and where is it gonna lead to yeah

5669.12 --> 5672.8
i can do that and it's not gonna get my

5671.76 --> 5676.400000000001
channel erased

5672.8 --> 5680.2390000000005
because that's not how it works

5676.4 --> 5683.44
despite the rumors that everybody

5680.239 --> 5685.839999999999
seems to persist on a voluntary basis

5683.44 --> 5686.48
without even realizing that it's not

5685.84 --> 5688.76
really

5686.48 --> 5691.759999999999
how it works it's just an

5688.76 --> 5691.76
oversimplification

5693.28 --> 5701.84
anyway yeah that's all fine septeppy

5706.159 --> 5710.96
yes they monitor me there's several

5708.56 --> 5712.88
professionals monitoring me

5710.96 --> 5715.84
and there's probably think tanks on my

5712.88 --> 5715.84
ass as well

5716.0 --> 5722.159
but they're yeah they're doing that we

5718.8 --> 5725.360000000001
are literally being data product we are

5722.159 --> 5727.92
like a petri dish to the corporatists

5725.36 --> 5729.599999999999
and they literally have dozens of people

5727.92 --> 5731.36
on almost everyone

5729.6 --> 5733.360000000001
but especially the people that make the

5731.36 --> 5735.599999999999
most sense

5733.36 --> 5738.32
have them hover over there maybe place

5735.6 --> 5741.679
some suggestions here and there

5738.32 --> 5745.599999999999
oh was from benson bennett not me

5741.679 --> 5748.4800000000005
okay oh right

5745.6 --> 5748.4800000000005
i mixed you up

5749.52 --> 5751.679
wait

5752.719 --> 5759.84
uh sorry band saw that madness

5756.96 --> 5759.84
right thank you

5760.0 --> 5771.84
yeah i mix you up sorry about that

5780.719 --> 5785.84
and thank you for the super chat the

5782.08 --> 5785.84
notion to remind me by the way

5788.159 --> 5791.759999999999
it's the kiwi all right

5810.84 --> 5813.84
right

5817.12 --> 5820.149
[Music]

5820.4 --> 5824.719
right and also by the way it's kind of

5823.76 --> 5826.56
funny

5824.719 --> 5829.199
you know if we're gonna talk yeah

5826.56 --> 5830.400000000001
continue that oh hydroxychloroquine

5829.199 --> 5833.36
situation

5830.4 --> 5834.32
you know the funny thing is is that i

5833.36 --> 5837.119
think there's probably

5834.32 --> 5837.119
a lot to it

5837.6 --> 5843.84
no matter what it's like yeah if you

5840.4 --> 5846.879999999999
have severe breathing condition

5843.84 --> 5847.6
through the inflammation i guess just

5846.88 --> 5851.76
any kind

5847.6 --> 5853.76
any kind and i think hydroxychloroquine

5851.76 --> 5855.1990000000005
basically no matter what you have is

5853.76 --> 5857.6
probably gonna help that

5855.199 --> 5858.96
that's kind of like what i'm getting

5857.6 --> 5860.639
echoes from out there

5858.96 --> 5863.52
that it's like yeah it's gonna be

5860.639 --> 5867.679
helpful with breathing problems

5863.52 --> 5869.92
so yeah

5867.679 --> 5871.1990000000005
does it mean that this corona thing

5869.92 --> 5875.1990000000005
coronu

5871.199 --> 5875.919999999999
is real but yeah if you got breathing

5875.199 --> 5878.32
problems

5875.92 --> 5881.04
that are probably related to some kind

5878.32 --> 5884.239
of infectious situation or anything

5881.04 --> 5888.96
then hydroxychloroquine seems to be very

5884.239 --> 5891.199
effective basically no matter what it is

5888.96 --> 5891.199
so

5894.48 --> 5901.36
no but you will be if you don't start

5898.88 --> 5904.32
saying anything else but being stupid

5901.36 --> 5904.32
completely pants

5908.84 --> 5911.84
there

5922.84 --> 5925.84
right

5948.719 --> 5955.199
they have started to take kyonen

5951.76 --> 5957.52
out of tonic water really was it in

5955.199 --> 5961.199
there i didn't even know that

5957.52 --> 5963.679
i did like it i i did drink some tonic

5961.199 --> 5966.08
back in the day

5963.679 --> 5968.8
in my at my teens especially when we

5966.08 --> 5968.8
went to spain

5969.6 --> 5974.400000000001
and it was also like said to be like oh

5972.0 --> 5977.44
that's like what the

5974.4 --> 5979.679
high class people take

5977.44 --> 5981.5199999999995
and i was like really bit of a snob i i

5979.679 --> 5983.28
really wanted to be like that you know

5981.52 --> 5985.119000000001
when i was a kid

5983.28 --> 5987.599999999999
got horseback riding and all that so i

5985.119 --> 5990.639
was like oh yeah i'm

5987.6 --> 5993.1990000000005
i'm going to marry a princess someday

5990.639 --> 5994.0
that that was in my head it's quite

5993.199 --> 5996.799999999999
ridiculous

5994.0 --> 5996.8
in retrospect

5998.56 --> 6004.119000000001
anyway i guess that from that

6000.4 --> 6007.44
perspective i didn't have a lot of

6004.119 --> 6010.4
self-worthiness issues

6007.44 --> 6010.719
it's just that socially i had issues

6010.4 --> 6023.839999999999
with

6010.719 --> 6023.84
other people but yeah whatever

6027.28 --> 6034.4
is in tonic water anti-malaria drug

6030.32 --> 6034.4
what never heard of that that's

6034.84 --> 6037.84
interesting

6046.0 --> 6051.84
what does that mean

6062.84 --> 6067.76
ugh

6065.04 --> 6071.44
it's still very warm despite that the

6067.76 --> 6071.4400000000005
the sun no longer hits the wall

6072.0 --> 6079.84
egg gearing me on what

6082.05 --> 6085.14
[Music]

6099.36 --> 6107.839999999999
what does that mean

6113.36 --> 6119.199
it was up until friday yes

6117.28 --> 6121.04
up until friday no i don't know the

6119.199 --> 6123.759999999999
weather said

6121.04 --> 6124.4
that's gonna die down like pretty much

6123.76 --> 6125.84
dip in

6124.4 --> 6127.44
at wednesday which is nice because

6125.84 --> 6128.88
that's when i have to do my paper rounds

6127.44 --> 6130.638999999999
and then afterwards it's gonna go up

6128.88 --> 6135.84
again actually

6130.639 --> 6135.84
let me go we'll check that by the way

6143.6 --> 6150.88
oh wait no it's gonna dip on saturday to

6147.679 --> 6150.88
22 degrees

6153.199 --> 6157.5199999999995
right after thursday it's supposed to

6154.96 --> 6159.6
start raining

6157.52 --> 6160.719
and then sunday it'll get better again

6159.6 --> 6165.4400000000005
and after that

6160.719 --> 6165.44
roughly get back to 33 degrees i think

6165.92 --> 6176.0
so that's nice like wednesday it's

6169.199 --> 6178.48
gonna be a little bit cooler

6176.0 --> 6178.48
i think

6179.28 --> 6185.679
wait no i looked at it wrong

6183.04 --> 6187.44
now it's gonna stay according to this 33

6185.679 --> 6190.08
degrees up until wednesday and now

6187.44 --> 6192.32
only thursday it's gonna get down a

6190.08 --> 6192.32
little

6197.52 --> 6202.320000000001
right 26 28 anyway we'll see what

6201.6 --> 6204.8
happens

6202.32 --> 6205.759999999999
i don't mind you know heat it's it's

6204.8 --> 6208.08
okay

6205.76 --> 6211.04
but if it stays too long it gets on my

6208.08 --> 6211.04
nerves eventually

6211.44 --> 6214.719
because it does slow me down

6216.84 --> 6233.84
significantly hmm

6234.48 --> 6238.5599999999995
yeah by the way thanks for sticking with

6236.159 --> 6241.599999999999
me this has been uh

6238.56 --> 6243.280000000001
unusually long episode longer than it

6241.6 --> 6245.360000000001
was yesterday

6243.28 --> 6246.96
because there is no flat earth debates

6245.36 --> 6250.32
apparently nathan hasn't been able to

6246.96 --> 6250.32
fix his computer just yet

6259.199 --> 6264.08
i don't know maybe i'll do this again

6261.52 --> 6264.080000000001
tomorrow

6265.84 --> 6269.76
i i don't mind sort of stepping in

6272.0 --> 6275.92
at least be some time filler for you of

6273.92 --> 6276.88
course it's not not really a flat earth

6275.92 --> 6280.56
debates here i'm not

6276.88 --> 6283.119
going up against bowlers or anything but

6280.56 --> 6283.119000000001
yeah it's

6283.92 --> 6287.1990000000005
i have done that in the past too by the

6285.92 --> 6289.52
way but

6287.199 --> 6291.28
i prefer to do those kind of things in

6289.52 --> 6293.1990000000005
the winter when i can just get really

6291.28 --> 6303.84
heated up without literally getting a

6293.199 --> 6303.839999999999
heat stroke

6306.96 --> 6317.84
i'm glad you're enjoying it amanda

6328.88 --> 6331.84
oh

6332.719 --> 6336.08
well thank you again drunkenmullet411

6334.88 --> 6336.56
for the five dollar ship with chad

6336.08 --> 6339.199
donation

6336.56 --> 6339.76
australian dollars keep it rolling my

6339.199 --> 6342.32
dude

6339.76 --> 6342.8
come on flatties show some love if you

6342.32 --> 6345.84
can

6342.8 --> 6345.84
you know

6351.36 --> 6355.36
if you really do want to help me out the

6353.44 --> 6358.32
most then

6355.36 --> 6360.48
paypal would be best i think most of the

6358.32 --> 6362.4
people in my chat already know that

6360.48 --> 6364.32
because yeah technically because of my

6362.4 --> 6366.5599999999995
circumstances being still on social

6364.32 --> 6369.36
welfare and having to report my income

6366.56 --> 6372.320000000001
from google to the government

6369.36 --> 6373.839999999999
pretty much 98 of everything that is

6372.32 --> 6378.159
donated through the super chat

6373.84 --> 6380.4800000000005
is lost is like i gotta give it all back

6378.159 --> 6381.679
and i'm even faced with literally that

6380.48 --> 6385.5199999999995
problem since

6381.679 --> 6388.8
i got this bonus unannounced from google

6385.52 --> 6389.52
in may and it kind of like slipped

6388.8 --> 6392.0
through

6389.52 --> 6394.4800000000005
and now i have to pay it back because i

6392.0 --> 6394.48
forgot

6394.56 --> 6398.639
so i could really use the support but

6396.88 --> 6401.84
yeah it would help the most if i got it

6398.639 --> 6401.84
through paypal

6406.239 --> 6410.239
the three figure super chats come on agm

6409.28 --> 6413.04
that's

6410.239 --> 6413.5199999999995
i'm not gonna abuse a guy like that

6413.04 --> 6417.36
that's

6413.52 --> 6419.679
that's wrong but hey if he

6417.36 --> 6421.199
sent me three figures through the paypal

6419.679 --> 6424.719
yeah

6421.199 --> 6426.48
i don't know it'd still be dubious

6424.719 --> 6429.199
i don't think he will i don't think

6426.48 --> 6430.638999999999
drunken bullet 411 is particularly rich

6429.199 --> 6433.678999999999
individual

6430.639 --> 6433.679
though he's not poor

6435.199 --> 6445.5199999999995
who knows by the way i don't know

6442.159 --> 6448.638999999999
where is the link the link

6445.52 --> 6452.159000000001
to my paypal is in the description box

6448.639 --> 6452.159000000001
below it's the first sentence

6452.96 --> 6457.84
and youtube crashed again yay

6470.8 --> 6476.639
grabbing me is on a roll yeah no but uh

6474.719 --> 6479.119
oh wait no it's not the first set my

6476.639 --> 6482.32
first sense is the skype address

6479.119 --> 6482.32
now that the paypal

6482.48 --> 6486.638999999999
yeah just send it to my email address

6484.88 --> 6491.679
that should work

6486.639 --> 6491.679
there's also a direct link

6492.96 --> 6496.639
so it's like the third and the fourth

6494.719 --> 6497.28
sentence in the description box of the

6496.639 --> 6500.639
youtube

6497.28 --> 6503.36
if you want to paypal me

6500.639 --> 6504.719
it would really help and thank you guns

6503.36 --> 6507.839999999999

add it to the live chat okay well

6518.32 --> 6521.5199999999995
i guess i'll just

6522.159 --> 6527.28
copy the whole sentence and paste it in

6538.84 --> 6541.84
there

6546.56 --> 6548.88
all right

6549.6 --> 6555.84
oh paypal means that dash arwin should

6552.84 --> 6555.84
work

6559.599 --> 6569.84
right yeah that should definitely work

6580.48 --> 6585.839999999999
you're slightly pushing it aren't you

6583.04 --> 6597.84
but sure i'll make it very easy on you

6585.84 --> 6597.84
here you go

6622.84 --> 6625.84

yeah party time indeed although

6813.599 --> 6821.84
it says it's still pending i don't know

6815.599 --> 6821.84
what that means

6825.28 --> 6835.84
i have to accept it okay

6845.679 --> 6850.639
okay i have to convert it

6860.84 --> 6866.32
what

6863.44 --> 6866.32
this is weird

6871.52 --> 6878.159000000001

6887.84 --> 6894.56
no that's that's okay aussie dollars

6891.76 --> 6895.1990000000005
it's just that normally it auto accepts

6894.56 --> 6897.599
and then

6895.199 --> 6899.04
changes it to euros and this time i had

6897.599 --> 6902.08
to like

6899.04 --> 6904.56
manually confirm that for some reason

6902.08 --> 6905.679
weird i never happened before but thank

6904.56 --> 6910.4800000000005
you so much

6905.679 --> 6910.4800000000005
serious support it's awesome

6913.44 --> 6923.5199999999995
whoever that was yeah it's from

6919.84 --> 6923.52
from drunkenbullet411

6927.36 --> 6933.839999999999
and worth much

6937.199 --> 6941.759999999999
i guess yeah i weirdly know if it isn't

6942.159 --> 6946.96
maybe that's why i don't know i

6945.679 --> 6948.719
don't want to bring up a whole new

6946.96 --> 6950.96
subject it's just that i've seen these

6948.719 --> 6953.92
videos from just

6950.96 --> 6955.599
police trading australians like really

6953.92 --> 6957.679
shitty

6955.599 --> 6959.76
even when they were wearing masks just

6957.679 --> 6960.2390000000005
physically mistreating them and [ __ ]

6959.76 --> 6963.92
over

6960.239 --> 6967.678999999999
curfew daytime curfew what the [ __ ]

6963.92 --> 6971.599
who the hell came up with daytime curfew

6967.679 --> 6971.599
that's the most insane thing i've ever

6972.84 --> 6975.84
heard

6976.08 --> 6989.84
anyway thank you

6979.119 --> 6989.839999999999
very much

6995.04 --> 7003.28
it's it's so absurd then some and

6998.4 --> 7003.28
i find that like truly truly

7014.84 --> 7017.84
disconcerting

7024.96 --> 7029.28
yeah yeah but who is doing that who is

7028.32 --> 7032.96
screwing you

7029.28 --> 7035.199
you know because i don't know if

7032.96 --> 7037.28
like what australia really is like but

7035.199 --> 7040.159
at this point it's like they turned it

7037.28 --> 7044.08
all into a giant death cam

7040.159 --> 7046.638999999999
like really really so

7044.08 --> 7048.639
is it too late is it just you there's

7046.639 --> 7052.08
nowhere left to go and everybody's just

7048.639 --> 7055.28
going to be slowly exterminated

7052.08 --> 7056.0
and turn into absolute slaves nowhere

7055.28 --> 7059.28
else to go

7056.0 --> 7061.44
or is there still some potential for

7059.28 --> 7062.8
i don't know real grassroots australians

7061.44 --> 7066.08
to actually just

7062.8 --> 7068.0
freaking exterminate that

7066.08 --> 7069.599
[ __ ] up government these people that

7068.0 --> 7073.119
made these decisions and just

7069.599 --> 7075.52
shoot them through the [ __ ] face

7073.119 --> 7075.5199999999995
you know

7078.159 --> 7081.44
because yeah if they're gonna do that

7081.04 --> 7086.48
yeah

7081.44 --> 7090.239
they they definitely need to die

7086.48 --> 7094.239
really they do that's not

7090.239 --> 7094.239
disputable as far as i'm concerned

7098.84 --> 7102.8
right so i don't know

7104.0 --> 7110.239
it's fine no mask i don't get why

7107.84 --> 7112.8
it's literally not just the people are

7110.239 --> 7115.36
just going to literally

7112.8 --> 7116.400000000001
just attack the police and just kill

7115.36 --> 7118.48
them

7116.4 --> 7119.759999999999
like oh you're gonna do that when we're

7118.48 --> 7122.718999999999
gonna kill you

7119.76 --> 7123.679
all not like a bunch of [ __ ] antifa

7122.719 --> 7126.159
morons

7123.679 --> 7127.679
just literally just oh you are going to

7126.159 --> 7130.879999999999
attack us

7127.679 --> 7132.96
like a occupational force

7130.88 --> 7134.8
then you're going to die and it's just

7132.96 --> 7138.159
going to swarm them all

7134.8 --> 7139.92
swarm them you know i bet there's more

7138.159 --> 7143.679
australians than there's police

7139.92 --> 7146.8
swarm them take their weapons from them

7143.679 --> 7149.84
go to the city council

7146.8 --> 7153.4400000000005
find the people who demanded this

7149.84 --> 7153.4400000000005
and kill them

7153.679 --> 7158.96
do it on camera so that everybody can be

7157.36 --> 7161.28
assured that they are

7158.96 --> 7161.28
dead

7163.44 --> 7169.598999999999
that's that's what i

7166.88 --> 7171.76
kind of would do want to do at least i

7169.599 --> 7172.08
don't know i'm a bit radical that way

7171.76 --> 7175.52
but

7172.08 --> 7176.239
i think it's really not that far off

7175.52 --> 7179.599
because

7176.239 --> 7181.44
the country is literally by these decree

7179.599 --> 7182.88
of these people and the cooperation of

7181.44 --> 7187.598999999999
the police being turned

7182.88 --> 7199.28
into a death camp

7187.599 --> 7201.84
do you understand

7199.28 --> 7201.84
refresh

7204.96 --> 7215.44
refresh what what does that mean

7212.88 --> 7215.4400000000005
so yeah

7216.0 --> 7220.719
i don't know that probably gave me a

7218.08 --> 7224.239
strike there but i mean it

7220.719 --> 7226.159
i really mean it and if you know if my

7224.239 --> 7229.04
government was like that as well i i'd

7226.159 --> 7230.799999999999
probably do that

7229.04 --> 7232.4
i think it's worth going to jail for

7230.8 --> 7234.96
something like that

7232.4 --> 7236.719
if you know like yeah i literally killed

7234.96 --> 7239.199
the person

7236.719 --> 7240.2390000000005
that was kind of openly trying to

7239.199 --> 7242.799999999999
exterminate

7240.239 --> 7242.799999999999
my people

7246.32 --> 7250.239
you know i i know that the system

7248.56 --> 7252.320000000001
doesn't give a [ __ ] whatever reason you

7250.239 --> 7254.638999999999
did that they'll pile it on oh

7252.32 --> 7256.48
they might even get an exception for

7254.639 --> 7261.119
death penalty just

7256.48 --> 7261.119
because of what i would have done jesus

7261.28 --> 7269.84
okay okay that's

7264.56 --> 7269.84
that's that's twice as much there

7270.32 --> 7283.84
thank you very much drunkenbullet411

7274.239 --> 7283.839999999999
i guess i really hit the snare there

7288.56 --> 7293.679
but yeah i'm very lucky that they're not

7291.44 --> 7296.48
literally doing that in the netherlands

7293.679 --> 7297.04
because the netherlands is just more

7296.48 --> 7300.239
active

7297.04 --> 7303.5199999999995
more proactively against it

7300.239 --> 7306.159
like the dutch people are like mini

7303.52 --> 7307.280000000001
level vigilant when they are vigilant

7306.159 --> 7311.598999999999
they are kind of like

7307.28 --> 7314.639
predisposition to be savagnes in ways

7311.599 --> 7316.4800000000005
but like that shit's not happening here

7314.639 --> 7318.32
yet the the worst thing they're doing is

7316.48 --> 7321.598999999999
just trying to

7318.32 --> 7323.04
shove our tax money towards these

7321.599 --> 7326.56
corrupt organizations

7323.04 --> 7327.199
and people are like dude no no you did

7326.56 --> 7331.1990000000005
not make

7327.199 --> 7334.159
us like tighten everything up

7331.199 --> 7335.199
to save in order for you to just give

7334.159 --> 7337.679
billions away

7335.199 --> 7339.119
you know that's that's also unacceptable

7337.679 --> 7342.4800000000005
but at least we don't have this

7339.119 --> 7345.199
ridiculous curfews here

7342.48 --> 7346.4
and no real fines at least not where i

7345.199 --> 7348.0
am and if they would

7346.4 --> 7350.0
then yeah they're going to be in trouble

7348.0 --> 7352.48
because i am going to

7350.0 --> 7355.44
jail if that happens because i'm not

7352.48 --> 7360.0
gonna pay and i'm going to attack

7355.44 --> 7362.638999999999
i will attack you for that

7360.0 --> 7363.44
first i'm going to just not cooperate

7362.639 --> 7365.4400000000005
and then if

7363.44 --> 7366.638999999999
some kind of physical action i'm going

7365.44 --> 7368.32
to attack you

7366.639 --> 7370.719
and you are going to end up in the

7368.32 --> 7371.119
hospital and i might end up dead or in

7370.719 --> 7374.4800000000005
jail

7371.119 --> 7381.839999999999
i don't care i'm gonna do it anyway

7374.48 --> 7381.839999999999
hear that

7390.4 --> 7393.5199999999995
take your [ __ ] taser and shove it in

7392.719 --> 7396.2390000000005
your face

7393.52 --> 7396.2390000000005
how about that

7404.96 --> 7409.679
right but anyway yeah i don't get why in

7407.679 --> 7411.92
australia this is happening

7409.679 --> 7412.88
and why people are literally just saying

7411.92 --> 7414.719
okay

7412.88 --> 7416.719
okay we'll do whatever you say even if

7414.719 --> 7421.119
that means that you're going to

7416.719 --> 7424.96
execute us literally going to break

7421.119 --> 7426.88
our health severely shorten our lifespan

7424.96 --> 7431.92
and our pleasure in life

7426.88 --> 7431.92
yeah i don't know man

7435.36 --> 7438.48
be careful well i'm always careful eyes

7437.679 --> 7441.04
white shut

7438.48 --> 7442.079
you know i'm not looking for this

7441.04 --> 7445.5199999999995
situation i'm not

7442.079 --> 7448.96
going to like the [ __ ] what i'm not

7445.52 --> 7452.0
even going to the freaking protests

7448.96 --> 7454.8
okay but if i am

7452.0 --> 7456.159
somewhere i just happen to be there and

7454.8 --> 7459.1990000000005
there is this

7456.159 --> 7461.598999999999
corona police or whatever coming

7459.199 --> 7462.4
first off i'll get away i will always

7461.599 --> 7464.639
flee

7462.4 --> 7466.96
because i feel it i know when it's

7464.639 --> 7470.0
trouble i know when they're scouting

7466.96 --> 7473.44
to attack i know how that works i can

7470.0 --> 7476.639
feel it i can feel it ten minutes away

7473.44 --> 7478.48
so i will simply not be there if i'm

7476.639 --> 7480.32
somehow cornered

7478.48 --> 7482.718999999999
and i can't get away and they're going

7480.32 --> 7484.96
to do that to me

7482.719 --> 7486.4800000000005
it's going to mean somebody's going to

7484.96 --> 7490.159
end up in a hospital and somebody's

7486.48 --> 7490.159
going to end up dead or in jail

7490.239 --> 7493.919999999999
and that's the way it's going to be i

7491.679 --> 7497.119
will not accept no matter

7493.92 --> 7499.36
the consequence no matter the

7497.119 --> 7502.159
consequence

7499.36 --> 7502.96
you try something on me i'm going to

7502.159 --> 7505.5199999999995
show you the

7502.96 --> 7506.079
full force of my spirit through my flesh

7505.52 --> 7509.360000000001
and it's going

7506.079 --> 7509.36
to hurt a lot

7509.52 --> 7514.56
and i don't need a freaking external

7512.32 --> 7517.119
weapon for that

7514.56 --> 7518.84
just so you know i can be butt naked i

7517.119 --> 7521.759999999999
can still put you in the [ __ ]

7518.84 --> 7525.84
hospital

7521.76 --> 7535.84
okay and i will

7525.84 --> 7535.84
if you try that [ __ ] on me

7536.48 --> 7549.839999999999
right so enough of that

7560.079 --> 7563.36
a drinking bullet for one you know i

7562.0 --> 7565.76
wonder

7563.36 --> 7567.839999999999
like if i'm gonna talk radical anyway

7565.76 --> 7570.2390000000005
like what would happen

7567.84 --> 7571.4400000000005
if like everybody that still had some

7570.239 --> 7573.119
weapon left

7571.44 --> 7574.638999999999
just got it out of their basement and

7573.119 --> 7576.96
started open carrying

7574.639 --> 7578.88
just with the police you know if

7576.96 --> 7579.679
literally everyone they encounter is

7578.88 --> 7582.719
going to have a gun

7579.679 --> 7584.56
guess what's going to happen it's going

7582.719 --> 7585.44
to hold be a whole lot of hassle a whole

7584.56 --> 7588.079000000001
lot of police

7585.44 --> 7588.879999999999
deaths and then eventually they'll just

7588.079 --> 7591.599
stop it

7588.88 --> 7594.079
they'll just recognize okay the public

7591.599 --> 7597.360000000001
has decided to self-arm

7594.079 --> 7601.44
we can't go up against that

7597.36 --> 7603.44
you're [ __ ] i hope they're gonna do it

7601.44 --> 7605.919999999999
i really hope for australia it's not

7603.44 --> 7608.239
just gonna all die

7605.92 --> 7609.28
because if this continues if you just

7608.239 --> 7613.759999999999
let it all happen

7609.28 --> 7613.759999999999
you're all going to be exterminated

7614.76 --> 7622.159000000001
exterminated either killed

7618.639 --> 7624.0
sterilized or defaced in a terrible way

7622.159 --> 7625.759999999999
that you can never take care of yourself

7624.0 --> 7627.76
again

7625.76 --> 7629.360000000001
that is what's going to happen you

7627.76 --> 7631.76
cannot let it continue

7629.36 --> 7633.598999999999
it's better to go berserk and just

7631.76 --> 7636.719
destroy them

7633.599 --> 7637.76
brute force better to do that than to

7636.719 --> 7641.84
slither

7637.76 --> 7644.56
away and yeah just like the freaking

7641.84 --> 7645.04
freaking disgusting pito basement murder

7644.56 --> 7648.320000000001
[ __ ]

7645.04 --> 7649.5199999999995
be that you're going to be that maybe

7648.32 --> 7652.32
not as overt

7649.52 --> 7653.040000000001
as raw evil like that that's going to

7652.32 --> 7656.0
happen

7653.04 --> 7656.96
very very slowly to everyone you know

7656.0 --> 7658.8
everyone

7656.96 --> 7660.2390000000005
everyone around you your entire family

7658.8 --> 7662.639
old young

7660.239 --> 7664.718999999999
that's what's going to happen if you let

7662.639 --> 7668.8
it if you let this continue

7664.719 --> 7668.8
they're all going to die

7673.44 --> 7680.638999999999
so yeah people that are responsible for

7676.96 --> 7685.44
for initiating this arrest them

7680.639 --> 7685.4400000000005
try them for treason and execute them

7685.92 --> 7692.32
they are marxist invaders

7689.84 --> 7693.52
they borrow themselves in and then they

7692.32 --> 7697.04
convert it

7693.52 --> 7700.639
to a hostile entity

7697.04 --> 7704.159
and they are traitors to the the very

7700.639 --> 7705.1990000000005
essence of the country to the spirit the

7704.159 --> 7708.079
people

7705.199 --> 7708.638999999999
the the what is necessary what is real

7708.079 --> 7710.799999999999
it's all

7708.639 --> 7713.36
lies all the corona lockdown [ __ ] it's

7710.8 --> 7715.679
all lies pure power grab

7713.36 --> 7718.639
they are traitors and they need to be

7715.679 --> 7718.639
executed

7718.8 --> 7722.56
i'm not talking four australians here

7721.679 --> 7724.2390000000005
and i hope

7722.56 --> 7726.639
they're listening and they're taking

7724.239 --> 7730.239
this to heart and i hope they

7726.639 --> 7733.119
let that seed grow because you know

7730.239 --> 7733.119
it's got to be done

7736.239 --> 7739.119
executed

7740.079 --> 7746.48
it's the only way it's the only thing

7743.36 --> 7748.4
that's going to stop it you can't you

7746.48 --> 7750.5599999999995
can't let them get away with slap on the

7748.4 --> 7755.379999999999
hand or just being fired or

7750.56 --> 7756.84
whatever fines no no they need to be

7755.38 --> 7759.84
[Music]

7756.84 --> 7759.84
executed

7760.639 --> 7764.639
because otherwise it's just gonna happen

7762.8 --> 7768.2390000000005
again very quickly

7764.639 --> 7771.36
and again and again and again no

7768.239 --> 7774.48
they need to be executed

7771.36 --> 7777.5199999999995
killed publicly not a secret

7774.48 --> 7778.638999999999
publicly they need to die and everyone

7777.52 --> 7787.84
needs to see it

7778.639 --> 7787.84
that they die when you do that

7788.32 --> 7793.679
no no no no i'm not gonna if you say

7791.599 --> 7796.719
that again i'm going to ban you

7793.679 --> 7799.599
do you understand eyes white shut

7796.719 --> 7801.119
everything i said is my opinion it's

7799.599 --> 7805.4400000000005
what i would do

7801.119 --> 7807.92
australia is not my country i'd say

7805.44 --> 7808.879999999999
if it were like that here i'd probably

7807.92 --> 7810.4
risk

7808.88 --> 7812.2390000000005
severe problems but that's my

7810.4 --> 7814.0
responsibility because it's everybody's

7812.239 --> 7817.119
own responsibility in how they

7814.0 --> 7820.639
act and not and they're not telling you

7817.119 --> 7824.719
to just go nuts for no good reason or go

7820.639 --> 7827.679
looking for a fight right

7824.719 --> 7828.4
but you need to take really radical

7827.679 --> 7831.599
action

7828.4 --> 7834.159
in australia against this situation

7831.599 --> 7834.96
and don't wait too long for it because

7834.159 --> 7839.44
otherwise

7834.96 --> 7843.04
everyone there is going to die

7839.44 --> 7847.919999999999
as if it was all a slow burning

7843.04 --> 7847.92
death camp and that's just the truth

7849.52 --> 7854.159000000001
what dude don't give me all your money

7852.679 --> 7857.36

hours

8027.92 --> 8039.84
this is my longest weekday show ever

8089.84 --> 8095.360000000001
sandals

8091.52 --> 8099.4400000000005
because yeah these boots

8095.36 --> 8101.28
i really love them they're very good

8099.44 --> 8102.96
but in this weather they're just so

8101.28 --> 8106.159
[ __ ] insanely hot it's

8102.96 --> 8107.76
not even funny anymore so i was

8106.159 --> 8109.759999999999
considering maybe getting a pair of

8107.76 --> 8111.52
sandals and i could definitely afford

8109.76 --> 8123.84
that with this

8111.52 --> 8123.84
so yeah just a small part of it

8124.079 --> 8129.28
all right thank you so much mandarin

8126.079 --> 8132.0
gold for one i really hope you uh

8129.28 --> 8132.719
you get through this this situation

8132.0 --> 8135.599
there and

8132.719 --> 8136.4800000000005
yeah keep me updated about it you know

8135.599 --> 8139.599
because

8136.48 --> 8141.44
i've i've been looking at it

8139.599 --> 8143.1990000000005
you know i know kind of what's happening

8141.44 --> 8144.5599999999995
in england but dave have been having

8143.199 --> 8148.079
issues for a long time

8144.56 --> 8150.079000000001
america it's bad but still mixed but in

8148.079 --> 8152.48
australia it's just

8150.079 --> 8153.759999999999
i've never seen anything like that it is

8152.48 --> 8159.28
so

8153.76 --> 8159.280000000001
so bad like something's got to break

8160.719 --> 8166.32
and just the punishment for yeah

8164.079 --> 8167.28
for the people that have done this to

8166.32 --> 8170.639
the country that

8167.28 --> 8173.599
needs to be extreme it needs to be the

8170.639 --> 8176.96
maximum punishment

8173.599 --> 8178.0
so that nobody would ever get it in

8176.96 --> 8183.199
their mind to do that

8178.0 --> 8183.199
again ever ever again under no

8189.33 --> 8193.28
[Music]

8190.84 --> 8196.24
circumstances

8193.28 --> 8197.2
it's only the state of victoria okay

8196.24 --> 8199.28
okay

8197.2 --> 8200.800000000001
okay i didn't know that i thought it was

8199.28 --> 8204.08
in the entire australia but

8200.8 --> 8205.039999999999
okay well that's certainly going to

8204.08 --> 8208.719
narrow down

8205.04 --> 8208.719000000001
down things at least

8209.359 --> 8212.0
that's better

8215.519 --> 8220.639000000001
now glad to hear that your that is not

8218.559 --> 8235.84
around you as it were that you're still

8220.639 --> 8235.839999999998
in a place where it's kind of livable

8236.639 --> 8240.559
all right bandsaw but that's where you

8238.319 --> 8240.559
were

8240.96 --> 8249.839999999998
right yeah you got a problem man

8254.08 --> 8258.88
maybe you guys could connect up and i

8256.16 --> 8264.08
dude if i were you i just flee

8258.88 --> 8264.08
that place well flee try to get out

8265.2 --> 8269.12
go yeah although yeah it's almost kind

8267.12 --> 8272.319000000001
of like a little bit too late for that

8269.12 --> 8274.479000000001
at this point who's gonna freaking buy a

8272.319 --> 8276.479
house in victoria now that this shit's

8274.479 --> 8280.88
going on

8276.479 --> 8280.88
it's so disastrous for the entire thing

8288.88 --> 8292.8
right and you know what it's going to do

8290.88 --> 8293.279999999999
it's going to create more debt and then

8292.8 --> 8296.399
people

8293.28 --> 8298.960000000001
are going to go to the who

8296.399 --> 8299.599
and the what is it the world bank and

8298.96 --> 8302.08
get more

8299.599 --> 8304.0
loans to compensate for the losses of

8302.08 --> 8307.76
covert oh

8304.0 --> 8311.679
was that the plan all along after all

8307.76 --> 8312.960000000001
was it yeah it was that's exactly the

8311.679 --> 8316.719000000001
plan

8312.96 --> 8319.839999999998
after all of it ruin everything

8316.719 --> 8323.358999999999
buy everything off cheap then get a lot

8319.84 --> 8325.92
of bailout money for what's left

8323.359 --> 8327.12
from the people that cost it so the

8325.92 --> 8330.559
country has more debt

8327.12 --> 8331.519
so they can dictate more policy to the

8330.559 --> 8334.719
country

8331.519 --> 8336.800000000001
create new disasters

8334.719 --> 8337.759999999998
so that they get more debt and then they

8336.8 --> 8341.039999999999
can yeah

8337.76 --> 8342.880000000001
appeal for more bailout money from the

8341.04 --> 8345.84
people who cause it again

8342.88 --> 8347.199999999999
yay yeah that's the plan that's covet

8345.84 --> 8350.0
that's the plan

8347.2 --> 8352.719000000001
that's what it is that's the whole

8350.0 --> 8352.719
situation

8353.359 --> 8362.24
it's all a giant bank extortion

8356.88 --> 8362.24
fraud scam governments are in on it

8371.2 --> 8376.240000000002
right so

radical speech a little concerning the

australian situation

8566.72 --> 8571.76
it is kind of radical but yeah that's

8568.64 --> 8574.64
really how i think it should be

8571.76 --> 8576.64
and yeah sometimes literally radicalness

8574.64 --> 8580.08
is the only thing that can stop

8576.64 --> 8581.279999999999
insanity from aggravating over time

8580.08 --> 8584.479
because it will

8581.28 --> 8588.16
if you don't really radically stop it

8584.479 --> 8591.199999999999
anyway uh i will be back tomorrow with
