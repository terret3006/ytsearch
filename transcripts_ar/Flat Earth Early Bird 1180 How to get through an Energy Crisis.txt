this month since i'm not going to have

110.32 --> 115.83999999999999
to pay something extra back because of

126.399 --> 132.239
a little loan but

130.0 --> 134.08
yeah that should stop this month but i'm

132.239 --> 135.59900000000002
still gonna have to basically get by

134.08 --> 137.20000000000002
until that time

135.599 --> 140.39999999999998
anyway

137.2 --> 144.79999999999998
somebody who has actually done that

140.4 --> 146.959
flat earth sage like one of my latest

144.8 --> 148.959
really loyal supporters sent me a paypal

146.959 --> 151.04
this night thank you very much man i

148.959 --> 155.56
really appreciate that

151.04 --> 155.56
it's guys like you that keep me going

157.519 --> 164.0
right anyway the weather today again is

161.76 --> 167.44
getting beautiful

164.0 --> 171.84
huh and i actually as a little bonus i i

167.44 --> 171.84
clean my windows before the show

172.319 --> 175.92
because they were kind of getting dirty

174.239 --> 178.159
and yeah when it's all rainy you don't

175.92 --> 180.0
really see that but when the sun shines

178.159 --> 182.159
through bright you see

180.0 --> 184.239
every little dot

182.159 --> 187.28
so i did my best to kind of clean it up

184.239 --> 187.28
it's not perfect

188.8 --> 193.20000000000002
but it's a lot cleaner right now yeah

190.56 --> 195.36
the skies are pretty blue and beautiful

193.2 --> 198.23899999999998
but there is some

195.36 --> 200.4
trail lingering going on as you can see

198.239 --> 201.92000000000002
right there

200.4 --> 204.0
so

201.92 --> 205.67999999999998
they're not leaving the sky completely

204.0 --> 208.08
untouched

205.68 --> 208.08
today

208.56 --> 213.2
although yeah

211.44 --> 215.68
don't know if that's gonna end up in a

213.2 --> 217.83999999999997
big haze later in this evening or if

215.68 --> 219.44
it's gonna just blow away

217.84 --> 221.92000000000002
with the wind

219.44 --> 221.92
we'll see

222.08 --> 226.799
but yeah it's actually nice and warm

224.4 --> 229.36
outside because there is not much i'm

226.799 --> 231.36
not a lot of wind

229.36 --> 234.239
so i was just literally sitting on the

231.36 --> 238.239
balcony on a chair

234.239 --> 238.239
and just enjoying the sun

238.84 --> 242.48
so it feels

241.04 --> 244.72
like it's warmer i'll check the

242.48 --> 248.51899999999998
temperature

244.72 --> 248.519
beautiful day overall

259.12 --> 265.44
hello wrath first in chat

262.0 --> 267.759
jado it's been a while

265.44 --> 271.84
jeff gas had

267.759 --> 271.84000000000003
borders boy good to see you all

272.0 --> 278.28
it is thursday the 10th of march 2022.

280.8 --> 283.8
ah

283.919 --> 291.03999999999996
i feel pretty good

286.4 --> 291.03999999999996
i did have a bit of a late night but

292.08 --> 296.24
still

293.44 --> 298.0
still rested pretty well yeah because i

296.24 --> 299.759
was basically

298.0 --> 301.759
playing that game again off world

299.759 --> 303.44
trading company i'm getting better at it

301.759 --> 306.0
so it's actually getting kind of

303.44 --> 306.0
interesting

307.6 --> 311.199
because there is definitely like a lot

309.919 --> 313.44
of

311.199 --> 313.44
uh

313.759 --> 318.639
difficulty curve

315.759 --> 321.84000000000003
within the game like if you start like

318.639 --> 324.72
oh for as a newbie

321.84 --> 326.96
newbie difficulty yeah it's doable but

324.72 --> 329.03900000000004
if you slide that up it actually does

326.96 --> 332.0
become more difficult and

329.039 --> 333.68
i'm just very curious to see if i if i

332.0 --> 334.88
got what it takes

333.68 --> 337.68
but yeah that

334.88 --> 340.32
it's a game that i can't like window up

337.68 --> 341.919
it it somehow for some reason demands

340.32 --> 344.479
full screen

341.919 --> 346.479
so i can't really multitask all too well

344.479 --> 349.199
with it and then i just end up playing

346.479 --> 352.56
that game and then it's like whoa

349.199 --> 354.479
did i just spend three hours on that and

352.56 --> 356.56
that way i ended up

354.479 --> 358.479
basically eating dinner

356.56 --> 361.36
starting to cook dinner at one o'clock

358.479 --> 363.59999999999997
at night which is not really good

361.36 --> 363.6
but

363.759 --> 366.639
yeah

364.56 --> 369.6
like my yeah

366.639 --> 371.44
because it gets a bit rumbling like if i

369.6 --> 372.56
am not feeling all that great and i eat

371.44 --> 376.24
that late

372.56 --> 378.08
then it's a problem it usually ends up

376.24 --> 379.759
like me feeling getting getting kind of

378.08 --> 381.59999999999997
sickish

379.759 --> 384.40000000000003
but it worked out

381.6 --> 386.639
chicken broccoli

384.4 --> 388.71999999999997
and i did i like had to

386.639 --> 390.479
i had to go and cook it because like it

388.72 --> 394.28000000000003
was on the

390.479 --> 394.28
expiration date

396.56 --> 398.88
ah

399.52 --> 404.479
hey that flat fellow

401.919 --> 404.479
rick back

405.68 --> 410.08
good to see

406.84 --> 412.71999999999997
you yeah yesterday show i thought was

410.08 --> 412.71999999999997
really good

415.599 --> 419.599
up until the troll

417.52 --> 421.12
the troll because i think it's one guy

419.599 --> 422.71999999999997
came in

421.12 --> 424.639
and then

422.72 --> 426.639
yeah

424.639 --> 429.759
at first i thought that i could like

426.639 --> 431.919
basically get rid of them

429.759 --> 437.319
even though i got a bit pissed off

431.919 --> 437.31899999999996
but he just he kind of ruined it

440.319 --> 445.12
so yeah that was like yeah the way it

442.8 --> 445.12
ended

445.599 --> 449.71999999999997
i'm yeah a bit disappointed

450.08 --> 453.599
yeah what do you what can you do he was

451.84 --> 455.44
just being really disruptive and

453.599 --> 458.08
constantly spamming with more sock

455.44 --> 458.08
accounts and

462.84 --> 467.75899999999996
yeah broccoli has to be the best green

me to the punch

764.399 --> 767.56
all right

785.68 --> 790.16
nine hours ago

787.839 --> 792.5600000000001
oh wow yeah well for me that would have

790.16 --> 795.36
been like in the middle of the night so

792.56 --> 795.3599999999999
no surprise

796.399 --> 803.079
yes that's like way too late for me to

799.04 --> 803.079
watch something like that

823.12 --> 826.88
yeah flat earth debate was also pretty

825.04 --> 830.16
interesting

826.88 --> 833.68
the aftershow lasted

830.16 --> 838.56
not super long but it did go away

833.68 --> 843.399
did take it's like a probably uh

838.56 --> 843.399
gonna be a four hour complete show

843.6 --> 846.48
something like that

848.32 --> 854.9590000000001
uh i think kumu got in there for a

851.279 --> 857.36
little not too long though

854.959 --> 859.279
did i watch the latest umbrella i've

857.36 --> 863.9590000000001
yeah i've i've been i'm still in the

859.279 --> 863.959
middle of watching that flatter sage

872.32 --> 875.6
i'm like halfway

880.48 --> 884.24
in a way i'm i'm kind of glad that owen

882.399 --> 886.959
benjamin doesn't do streams in the

884.24 --> 889.04
weekend usually because then i have some

886.959 --> 892.6389999999999
time to kind of catch up to his streams

889.04 --> 892.639
because it's just way too much

896.32 --> 899.839
and also yeah

904.48 --> 909.36
it is like he is treating in the last

907.44 --> 912.72
show he is training it's like there's

909.36 --> 915.6
this level of tension and it's kind of

912.72 --> 915.6
it's pretty heavy

920.0 --> 923.92
so yeah i didn't think it was like a

921.68 --> 925.8389999999999
stream let's just comfortably listen to

923.92 --> 928.3199999999999
that in the background it does like

925.839 --> 930.5600000000001
require a bit of focus

928.32 --> 933.44
because it is all pretty tense it's

930.56 --> 933.4399999999999
tense subject

934.56 --> 937.56
um

940.079 --> 945.199
got the jose computer fi what on your

942.88 --> 945.199
phone

945.68 --> 948.68
what

959.12 --> 961.44
what

961.759 --> 965.32
is that a thing

978.639 --> 981.639
hmm

985.839 --> 988.1600000000001
right

989.279 --> 993.6
i've been thinking by the way like how

991.199 --> 995.3599999999999
could have i solved how could i have

993.6 --> 996.8000000000001
solved the issues with the trolls

995.36 --> 1000.72
yesterday

996.8 --> 1000.7199999999999
i was thinking what if i had

1004.56 --> 1011.199
like initiated

1006.959 --> 1013.04
members only mode

1011.199 --> 1017.24
but here's the thing i don't really know

1013.04 --> 1017.24
how to do that mid stream

1029.679 --> 1032.959
let me see

1030.959 --> 1036.72
already i've never done it

1032.959 --> 1036.72
before live midstream

1037.52 --> 1039.839
uh

1056.48 --> 1060.919
where do i change that customization

1061.039 --> 1067.559
slow mode subscribers

1064.559 --> 1067.559
oh

1067.76 --> 1072.16
okay

1069.919 --> 1072.16
that's

1072.24 --> 1077.84
minimum subscribe time

1074.96 --> 1077.8400000000001
five minutes

1077.919 --> 1080.919
huh

1082.16 --> 1085.1200000000001
that's interesting

1086.32 --> 1090.039
let me try that

1096.4 --> 1099.2800000000002
see if that worked

1103.6 --> 1108.9599999999998
it's interesting

1105.28 --> 1111.6789999999999
there was another option

1108.96 --> 1114.32
so this is not members and ranches only

1111.679 --> 1115.1200000000001
but subscribers only

1114.32 --> 1116.72
so

1115.12 --> 1119.52
yeah

1116.72 --> 1121.039
if they want to suck spam me

1119.52 --> 1124.72
about something then they'll have to

1121.039 --> 1127.76
like pre-register subscribe their

1124.72 --> 1129.679
all their youtube accounts

1127.76 --> 1131.52
first

1129.679 --> 1134.52
maybe that'll make it a bit more of a

1131.52 --> 1134.52
hassle

1137.919 --> 1145.039
so yeah i'm gonna it's not members only

1141.679 --> 1147.2800000000002
i could turn on members only

1145.039 --> 1149.44
but then again there are still just

1147.28 --> 1153.28
people that come here and follow me

1149.44 --> 1153.28
regularly that don't have wrenches

1155.2 --> 1163.32
that i'm not planning to give wrenches

1159.039 --> 1163.32
but that i still like to have around

1167.36 --> 1173.32
so i'm gonna try this

1169.84 --> 1173.32
see what happens

1187.12 --> 1190.12
kevlar

1198.16 --> 1202.0
right and if the trolls do kind of want

1200.24 --> 1203.44
to get involved

1202.0 --> 1205.36
then i'm going to have some weird

1203.44 --> 1206.96
fluctuation going on with the amount of

1205.36 --> 1208.8799999999999
subscribers because then they're gonna

1206.96 --> 1210.88
have to effectively

1208.88 --> 1213.1200000000001
not just make their socks

1210.88 --> 1214.0
but also have them subscribe to do that

1213.12 --> 1215.76
thing

1214.0 --> 1218.72
and of course later would be deleted but

1215.76 --> 1221.44
it would give like a sort of

1218.72 --> 1223.679
pump and dump in our wind subs and by

1221.44 --> 1225.1200000000001
the way my rwin subs has actually gone

1223.679 --> 1226.799
up

1225.12 --> 1230.36
a bit

1226.799 --> 1230.36
took long enough

1235.28 --> 1238.0
what is that

1241.52 --> 1248.2
it's now at 2143

1245.2 --> 1248.2
woohoo

1255.2 --> 1259.919
so thanks everybody for subscribing if

1257.679 --> 1262.0
you actually genuinely wanted to

1259.919 --> 1264.3200000000002
subscribe

1262.0 --> 1265.52
and not just

1264.32 --> 1267.28
the screw

1265.52 --> 1270.6
with me

1267.28 --> 1270.6
but now

1279.679 --> 1283.76
yeah hey brendam good see you yeah i

1282.0 --> 1286.24
know you don't have a wrench i could

1283.76 --> 1289.24
give you one

1286.24 --> 1289.24
but

1291.039 --> 1295.36
yeah you you don't really come in a lot

1293.12 --> 1295.36
so

1302.08 --> 1308.72
i kind of want to give you a wrench

1304.64 --> 1308.72
unless you're gonna say i don't want one

1309.039 --> 1313.44
which some people in chat have said

1314.799 --> 1318.72
and some don't know how to use it

1316.799 --> 1321.039
properly and they look out looking for

1318.72 --> 1325.24
fights

1321.039 --> 1325.24
you're not one of those by the way

1346.159 --> 1349.8400000000001
give you a red no wrath

1348.799 --> 1353.36
oh

1349.84 --> 1353.36
no that's not how that works

1355.52 --> 1360.96
i was kind of thinking of giving you a

1357.679 --> 1364.8400000000001
wrench at some point but yeah you should

1360.96 --> 1364.8400000000001
read the chat rules

1376.24 --> 1379.84
right but

1378.08 --> 1382.0
yeah because you don't well you're not

1379.84 --> 1383.9189999999999
really a newcomer

1382.0 --> 1387.559
but technically you're not supposed to

1383.919 --> 1387.5590000000002
ask for rich

1399.12 --> 1404.08
really flat fellow

1401.12 --> 1404.08

1480.88 --> 1486.96
on camera

1483.12 --> 1489.36
because i did notice you had a channel

1486.96 --> 1490.88
but yeah last video you uploaded there

1489.36 --> 1494.52
was like

1490.88 --> 1494.5200000000002
two years ago

1505.039 --> 1510.72
i don't see your face on those and

1507.84 --> 1510.72
they're very short

1511.679 --> 1516.4
first all right

1514.72 --> 1519.039
it's your flat earth

1516.4 --> 1521.76
youtube coming out

whoa kevlar you're trying to get a date

1570.0 --> 1575.32
no nobody love i love seeking star water

1587.52 --> 1592.4
all right so yeah for those that have

1589.6 --> 1595.039
just joined i'm trying out subscriber

1592.4 --> 1598.0800000000002
only mode

1595.039 --> 1600.24
which i didn't even know existed

1598.08 --> 1601.84
i thought it was just members only mode

1600.24 --> 1603.84
or just regular but there's a

1601.84 --> 1606.1589999999999
subscribers only mode as well and i'm

1603.84 --> 1608.48
gonna see if that actually works against

1606.159 --> 1610.88
those nagging

1608.48 --> 1612.559
anti-flat earther troll

1610.88 --> 1616.48
wretches

1612.559 --> 1616.48
that tend to come in the last half hour

1618.4 --> 1622.2
yeah right kevlar

1630.559 --> 1632.799
um

1637.84 --> 1643.039
i still remember like well my first show

1641.12 --> 1646.08
i was nervous

1643.039 --> 1647.36
but i was like so much into the models

1646.08 --> 1650.1589999999999
right

1647.36 --> 1653.279
because i had basically like grabbed

1650.159 --> 1657.5200000000002
towards the future big time like guys if

1653.279 --> 1657.52
you've seen my very first video

1658.48 --> 1662.72
let's see which one was that

1666.64 --> 1671.3600000000001
the first video where i actually came on

1668.96 --> 1671.3600000000001
camera

1673.6 --> 1679.6399999999999
right

1674.559 --> 1679.6399999999999
with robert shortman where are we

1688.799 --> 1692.48
like

1689.6 --> 1693.76
i was so into it that i wasn't even all

1692.48 --> 1697.52
that nervous

1693.76 --> 1699.279
when i that i was really nervous for

1697.52 --> 1702.32
was the time that i went on with

1699.279 --> 1702.32
patricia stare

1702.64 --> 1705.76
which was much later

1707.6 --> 1712.24
was yeah i basically mirrored it it's

1710.08 --> 1715.6789999999999
like i rarely mirror

1712.24 --> 1715.679
anything anyway right

1716.159 --> 1721.5200000000002
but it was like episode 187 flat earth

1719.36 --> 1725.24
and other hot potatoes that one i was

1721.52 --> 1725.24
really nervous for

1728.32 --> 1732.559
because yeah i knew that

1730.799 --> 1734.08
she was kind of

1732.559 --> 1736.0
interested in me

1734.08 --> 1740.08
and really proving that

1736.0 --> 1744.559
like in detail so i was really honored

1740.08 --> 1744.559
but also like yeah that means that

1744.72 --> 1748.3990000000001
you could be expecting absolutely

1747.039 --> 1752.24
anything

1748.399 --> 1754.2399999999998
question wise from her and she did like

1752.24 --> 1755.279
ask pretty broad so yeah it was really

1754.24 --> 1759.039
but

1755.279 --> 1759.039
i was really nervous for that one

1765.52 --> 1770.48
your tarot deck is your baby

1768.96 --> 1773.1200000000001
right

1770.48 --> 1775.2
yeah yeah well if you're like really

1773.12 --> 1776.399
serious with your cards

1775.2 --> 1778.0800000000002
right

1776.399 --> 1780.6399999999999
there's a lot of energy invested in

1778.08 --> 1783.6789999999999
there purity to be maintained

1780.64 --> 1786.96
then it's always kind of

1783.679 --> 1788.24
like it can be unnerving to be with

1786.96 --> 1790.32
new

1788.24 --> 1792.159
people

1790.32 --> 1794.32
oh yeah and you made that terror deck

1792.159 --> 1795.279
didn't you

1794.32 --> 1796.559
yeah

1795.279 --> 1799.279
that's right

1796.559 --> 1802.279
oh yeah that makes it even more

1799.279 --> 1802.279
special

1842.799 --> 1845.96
thank you

1857.76 --> 1861.919
yeah now i'm i'm really curious now to

1860.159 --> 1863.7600000000002
actually watch that but yeah i'm gonna

1861.919 --> 1867.6000000000001
have to wait until my own show is over

1863.76 --> 1867.6
i'm not going to watch it during my show

1867.76 --> 1870.76
oh

1878.159 --> 1881.519
okay mortars boy

1882.08 --> 1884.32
well

1885.039 --> 1890.08
i mean if it didn't cost you a big chunk

1887.76 --> 1893.84
of cash

1890.08 --> 1893.84
then yeah i don't know

1894.88 --> 1899.679
if if you're feeling something might be

1897.36 --> 1900.9599999999998
coming then yeah better safe than sorry

1899.679 --> 1902.3990000000001
right

1900.96 --> 1905.3600000000001
fire extinguisher i have fire

1902.399 --> 1909.4399999999998
extinguishers here too

1905.36 --> 1909.4399999999998
you never really know what could happen

1910.399 --> 1915.6789999999999
well you you have a reasonable oversight

1913.679 --> 1918.48
is what can happen but

1915.679 --> 1920.24
yeah i mean i wouldn't i'm not blaming

1918.48 --> 1924.0
you for buying an extinguished fire

1920.24 --> 1924.0
extinguisher after a dream like that

1924.96 --> 1930.159
15 bucks oh yeah 15 pounds yeah that's

1928.08 --> 1932.6399999999999
that's

1930.159 --> 1935.64
that's not really a rib out of your body

1932.64 --> 1935.64
right

1949.84 --> 1953.519
hey wrath are you all right

1959.12 --> 1967.0
you seem to be acting a little odd

1962.96 --> 1967.0
did you have a proper sleep

1988.64 --> 1991.64
right

2011.039 --> 2016.08
right yeah fire extinguisher hope you

2013.44 --> 2018.72
never have to use it but still you know

2016.08 --> 2021.76
if you have one

2018.72 --> 2024.159
and your full availability over the

2021.76 --> 2025.919
area because it's your house in a garden

2024.159 --> 2028.0
i don't know what what your living

2025.919 --> 2030.0
situation is

2028.0 --> 2032.08
but then it's always kind of handy to

2030.0 --> 2036.64
have one around like for if you wanted

2032.08 --> 2036.6399999999999
to make a campfire or something right

2039.2 --> 2043.6000000000001
because usually nothing goes wrong with

2041.679 --> 2046.0800000000002
that and there's other ways to fix it

2043.6 --> 2048.159
but yeah if you just happen to have a

2046.08 --> 2050.3199999999997
fire extinguisher and something does get

2048.159 --> 2055.0
out of hand it's always super handy

2050.32 --> 2055.0
right if you're gonna have one anyway

2063.44 --> 2068.56
in a coal fire household what really

2070.24 --> 2076.24
it's like a a coal burn kettle for the

2073.76 --> 2076.2400000000002
heating

2077.76 --> 2081.9190000000003
or is it more like a coal fire hearth

2086.32 --> 2089.8
matthew hall

2104.8 --> 2108.3590000000004
yeah agreed

2120.56 --> 2125.04
oh really you got an all-in-one system

2127.599 --> 2133.52
the radiators too move and heat water

2131.119 --> 2135.599
heating so it's like this giant central

2133.52 --> 2139.599
heating

2135.599 --> 2139.599
coal fire kettle huh

2139.68 --> 2145.839
i didn't even know these those still

2141.359 --> 2145.839
existed is it a really old model

2158.32 --> 2165.0
is it like one of those

2160.8 --> 2165.0
things that really makes noise

2176.96 --> 2182.28
ah

2178.16 --> 2182.2799999999997
you live rural yeah

2193.04 --> 2197.52
yeah well if you live rural you're

2195.04 --> 2200.079
basically surrounded by

2197.52 --> 2205.2
flammable things especially if it gets

2200.079 --> 2205.2000000000003
hot and dry in the summer right so yeah

2207.839 --> 2210.7999999999997
it's always

2209.04 --> 2215.48
good to have

2210.8 --> 2215.48
a fire extinguisher around i guess

2230.16 --> 2236.3999999999996
ah wow matthew hall fascinating right i

2233.52 --> 2238.64
i was i was gonna ask but i thought

2236.4 --> 2240.88
let's not ask like is it like one of

2238.64 --> 2240.8799999999997
those

2240.96 --> 2249.44
late 19th century designs like cast iron

2245.68 --> 2252.24
and those are can get noisy and [ __ ]

2249.44 --> 2254.56
but they do like last forever

2252.24 --> 2258.3999999999996
they don't really break down

2254.56 --> 2258.4
and when they do you're like screwed

2264.0 --> 2267.44
because

2264.88 --> 2270.44
they're like notoriously difficult to

2267.44 --> 2270.44
fix

2282.48 --> 2285.48
hmm

2296.4 --> 2300.48
i do kind of like the old tech though

2302.16 --> 2307.92
it's not so click easy

2304.56 --> 2309.599
as like modern conveniences

2307.92 --> 2314.4
but like

2309.599 --> 2314.4
it does have like such a

2315.04 --> 2319.7599999999998
central functioning to it

2317.28 --> 2322.0
all the old tech

2319.76 --> 2324.5600000000004
from late 19th century

2322.0 --> 2327.28
and like all of that oh it was always

2324.56 --> 2328.96
built to last very long right big

2327.28 --> 2330.8
difference with now

2328.96 --> 2332.2400000000002
everything is just like oh it works

2330.8 --> 2334.4
perfectly

2332.24 --> 2336.0789999999997
oh and it breaks you just exchange it

2334.4 --> 2339.2000000000003
for a new one

2336.079 --> 2341.2000000000003
but then it tends to like break very

2339.2 --> 2343.839
quickly

2341.2 --> 2346.48
so you become dependent on the store

2343.839 --> 2350.64
basically for your new version well the

2346.48 --> 2350.64
old tech didn't have that at all

2350.72 --> 2356.3199999999997
right at best you'd become dependent on

2353.92 --> 2358.079
their specialist repairman

2356.32 --> 2360.2400000000002
because they needed more specialist

2358.079 --> 2362.88
repairmen because like those devices

2360.24 --> 2362.8799999999997
were all

2364.079 --> 2369.04
like

2365.2 --> 2371.839
more handmade and all that

2369.04 --> 2374.4
right it wasn't all just prefab parts

2371.839 --> 2374.4
and everything

2376.0 --> 2380.32
so you definitely if you wanted to have

2378.0 --> 2383.2
those types of appliances you needed a

2380.32 --> 2385.3590000000004
repairman at hand that was like really

2383.2 --> 2387.2799999999997
necessary

2385.359 --> 2389.119
because or you'd have to be like a

2387.28 --> 2391.0400000000004
pretty talented

2389.119 --> 2392.6400000000003
engineer type that could fix their own

2391.04 --> 2396.32
car and then you might be able to

2392.64 --> 2399.1189999999997
maintain your own

2396.32 --> 2400.32
centralized cattle as well

2399.119 --> 2405.599
kettle

2400.32 --> 2407.04
nah do i like steampunk not particularly

2405.599 --> 2409.04
it's the weird thing i don't

2407.04 --> 2411.2799999999997
particularly i don't like the style

2409.04 --> 2413.839
really

2411.28 --> 2416.4
but i do get it

2413.839 --> 2419.52
and i will recognize it my ex used to be

2416.4 --> 2419.52
in steampunk a lot

2421.839 --> 2424.4
but a lot

2423.2 --> 2427.9199999999996
partially

2424.4 --> 2429.359
also also kind of renaissance style

2427.92 --> 2431.599
but

2429.359 --> 2434.48
me not so much

2431.599 --> 2436.8
but i do like appreciate

2434.48 --> 2439.839
how things worked

2436.8 --> 2442.7200000000003
and i i really love

2439.839 --> 2442.72
just the old

2443.599 --> 2449.079
the old trade of mechanic and all that

2453.44 --> 2457.92
and how things were designed back then

2455.2 --> 2459.9199999999996
to last a long time right

2457.92 --> 2462.16
it was a big hassle to make

2459.92 --> 2465.28
big hassle to repair

2462.16 --> 2467.92
but they wouldn't break a lot

2465.28 --> 2469.76
it would last a very long time

2467.92 --> 2472.16
and yeah things are usually kind of

2469.76 --> 2472.1600000000003
heavy

2473.52 --> 2477.68
it's all that pre-electronic era

2477.92 --> 2482.48
steampunk-ish like designs because that

2480.56 --> 2485.72
was the technology that was available

2482.48 --> 2485.72
back then

2501.52 --> 2505.64
yeah yeah borders boy yeah

2514.4 --> 2516.64
well

2517.44 --> 2521.92
it's great to kind of have both right

2519.599 --> 2524.319
it's it's just kind of cool to have a

2521.92 --> 2527.6800000000003
fireplace that could work

2524.319 --> 2529.68
but still have like modern

2527.68 --> 2531.2799999999997
modern equipment for your central

2529.68 --> 2532.3999999999996
heating

2531.28 --> 2534.5600000000004
but it's

2532.4 --> 2538.0
it's just great if you could choose to

2534.56 --> 2540.48
basically like hey let's

2538.0 --> 2543.68
make a hearthfire

2540.48 --> 2547.44
and just sit around that and

2543.68 --> 2547.44
have a drink or something have a talk

2548.96 --> 2552.68
those are great moments

2582.96 --> 2589.2
put a wood burner

2586.079 --> 2591.119
yeah or just like a regular hearth yeah

2589.2 --> 2593.2
if you if the chimney is still there and

2591.119 --> 2596.079
you could open it

2593.2 --> 2599.2
you got to be careful though that

2596.079 --> 2601.04
if there's like uh what is it not ashes

2599.2 --> 2603.839
but

2601.04 --> 2605.04
the black stuff is pure carbon that kind

2603.839 --> 2606.88
yeah

2605.04 --> 2609.04
if it's been closed off for a long time

2606.88 --> 2611.44
you got to be careful because that stuff

2609.04 --> 2612.48
could potentially ignite right that's

2611.44 --> 2615.04
why

2612.48 --> 2617.04
they used to have chimney cleaners

2615.04 --> 2618.56
because if they didn't clean the chimney

2617.04 --> 2620.64
either it would

2618.56 --> 2622.16
get clogged up

2620.64 --> 2625.04
and then smoke would get inside the

2622.16 --> 2626.7999999999997
house or it could just suddenly ignite

2625.04 --> 2630.16
or at least so i've heard i've never

2626.8 --> 2632.5600000000004
actually seen that that's what was said

2630.16 --> 2634.64
to me i don't know if that's actually a

2632.56 --> 2636.88
real thing that really happens

2634.64 --> 2638.16
but i believed it

2636.88 --> 2640.079
so you got to be

2638.16 --> 2641.7599999999998
i would be careful when opening up a

2640.079 --> 2643.599
chimney make sure that the whole thing

2641.76 --> 2646.599
is kind of

2643.599 --> 2646.599
clean

2666.319 --> 2669.2799999999997
yeah

2667.52 --> 2672.0
see your dream coming into play with

2669.28 --> 2672.0
this side yeah

2672.079 --> 2675.119
right well if you're going to try out a

2673.76 --> 2678.0
fireplace

2675.119 --> 2682.6800000000003
you know it's pretty handy to have

2678.0 --> 2682.68
a fire extinguisher around so

2695.68 --> 2698.56
right

2697.359 --> 2701.7599999999998
but yeah yeah

2698.56 --> 2704.0789999999997
the whole thing though is that

2701.76 --> 2706.079
the only chimneys only really start to

2704.079 --> 2708.2400000000002
clog up when you like

2706.079 --> 2709.52
get a chimney

2708.24 --> 2712.0789999999997
based uh

2709.52 --> 2715.28
hearthfire every night right if you're

2712.079 --> 2717.28
like dependent on your house heating

2715.28 --> 2719.0400000000004
the fireplace yeah then it's gonna clog

2717.28 --> 2720.4
up you have to clean it regularly but if

2719.04 --> 2724.56
you're just gonna have it for

2720.4 --> 2726.56
opportunities and like light it maybe

2724.56 --> 2728.72
a couple of times a year

2726.56 --> 2731.44
it's not really gonna clog it although

2728.72 --> 2734.72
it might clog up with spider webs right

2731.44 --> 2734.7200000000003
which can ignite too

2737.52 --> 2741.2
so it's just mostly just clean it out

2739.68 --> 2742.96
first time and if you already have

2741.2 --> 2744.72
central heating you're not gonna like

2742.96 --> 2747.2
use it every day

2744.72 --> 2750.319
so if you just got it cleaned one time

2747.2 --> 2754.0789999999997
then after that it should be

2750.319 --> 2758.52
yeah very little effort to maintain that

2754.079 --> 2758.52
why are we talking about this anyways

2762.88 --> 2766.2400000000002
roast bat

2764.24 --> 2770.2
what the

2766.24 --> 2770.2
bird's nest yeah yeah

2780.4 --> 2783.76
creo saute

2784.079 --> 2789.1600000000003
creo salt never heard of that word

2789.359 --> 2796.96
in dutch we call it a root

2792.56 --> 2796.96
which is like the pure black stuff

2797.76 --> 2802.88
and that is basically pure carbon and it

2800.16 --> 2804.319
can ignite

2802.88 --> 2806.079
so that's called

2804.319 --> 2808.4
kryot

2806.079 --> 2810.0
hmm in english that's a very different

2808.4 --> 2812.96
word

2810.0 --> 2815.359
fire marshall arwin yeah it dude

2812.96 --> 2819.04
yeah you might not know this about me

2815.359 --> 2820.16
i'm a freaking fire master

2819.04 --> 2823.04
i can

2820.16 --> 2825.2799999999997
and i think people witness this

2823.04 --> 2827.68
i can literally pick

2825.28 --> 2830.8
hot burning coals out of fires with my

2827.68 --> 2832.0789999999997
bare hands without getting burned yeah

2830.8 --> 2835.44
i know

2832.079 --> 2835.44
i know just how to do it

2836.4 --> 2839.119
but i

2837.599 --> 2842.1600000000003
am

2839.119 --> 2845.839
really good with fires i i make them i

2842.16 --> 2847.359
organize them i make sure that like the

2845.839 --> 2850.0789999999997
wood

2847.359 --> 2852.4
doesn't burn up quickly that the smoke

2850.079 --> 2855.04
is minimized and that the heat output is

2852.4 --> 2855.04
maximized

2855.119 --> 2860.2400000000002
i love wood fires but i love them more

2858.319 --> 2863.2799999999997
when they're out in the open but it can

2860.24 --> 2865.2799999999997
also be built like kilns

2863.28 --> 2867.28
for purposes

2865.28 --> 2871.0400000000004
like for example if i didn't have any

2867.28 --> 2872.8
like gas tank based fire things

2871.04 --> 2874.96
right if it didn't have those resources

2872.8 --> 2879.119
i could literally make a kill

2874.96 --> 2879.119
and still do goats goldsmithing

2880.319 --> 2886.079
i mean anybody could technically do it

2882.96 --> 2888.8
most people wouldn't probably do it i

2886.079 --> 2891.119
know i can do it because i really trust

2888.8 --> 2892.7200000000003
in my skills with fire

2891.119 --> 2895.839
and i'm not afraid of fire i'm not

2892.72 --> 2898.16
afraid of extreme heat

2895.839 --> 2900.88
well i don't like to get burned right i

2898.16 --> 2902.48
could get burned but i really know how

2900.88 --> 2906.6400000000003
to deal with heat i have a good

2902.48 --> 2906.64
intuition with it and i'm not afraid

2907.839 --> 2911.2
hey david weiss

2911.76 --> 2914.76
hello

2920.64 --> 2925.2799999999997
you had a really interesting little film

2923.2 --> 2929.2799999999997
the other day

2925.28 --> 2932.0
little video from 1946

2929.28 --> 2932.0
david weiss

2933.119 --> 2938.0
the v2 rocket film

2936.0 --> 2941.2
that one i love that one i've never seen

2938.0 --> 2943.52
that before this that's archaic that

2941.2 --> 2945.9199999999996
video is like so old

2943.52 --> 2949.88
i'll link you guys up this

2945.92 --> 2949.88
is david weiss's video

2956.64 --> 2961.92
crayola suit

2958.8 --> 2964.92
okay also what

2961.92 --> 2964.92
hmm

2981.28 --> 2985.8
ah

2982.8 --> 2985.8
okay

2996.839 --> 3000.72
huh

2998.48 --> 3003.44
that's funny it then it must be

3000.72 --> 3003.4399999999996
synonymous

3006.05 --> 3010.88
[Applause]

3009.92 --> 3013.92
oh

3010.88 --> 3016.92
in english root is called suit

3013.92 --> 3016.92
s-o-o-t

3018.96 --> 3024.2400000000002
is that exactly the same thing or is it

3021.119 --> 3024.2400000000002
like really close

3024.4 --> 3029.92
maybe it's like a different type of

3026.88 --> 3032.2400000000002
influence i don't know

3029.92 --> 3032.2400000000002
right

3032.8 --> 3038.079
never heard of that word though creosote

3035.839 --> 3041.0789999999997
suits

3038.079 --> 3041.079
hmm

3055.119 --> 3059.119
and a wesk

3056.64 --> 3061.92
and a wear mask on board the plane to

3059.119 --> 3064.8
max oh how dare you david

3061.92 --> 3066.839
you're one of them you wore a mask on a

3064.8 --> 3070.2400000000002
plane oh my

3066.839 --> 3071.2
god you're in on the whole thing weren't

3070.24 --> 3074.0789999999997
you

3071.2 --> 3074.0789999999997
david wise

3074.559 --> 3080.7200000000003
uh rv i can't believe he's still like

3078.559 --> 3083.7200000000003
trying to go after you like that so

3080.72 --> 3083.72
ridiculous

3106.8 --> 3112.319
suit can result from the poor combustion

3109.28 --> 3115.6800000000003
of oil and gas and wood

3112.319 --> 3115.68
was the tarp reduced

3117.839 --> 3122.0
oh okay

3118.96 --> 3123.76
thank you for that detail

3122.0 --> 3125.76
comparison

3123.76 --> 3128.7200000000003
punani

3125.76 --> 3132.4
huh so there is it's not exactly the

3128.72 --> 3136.319
same it's just like very adjacent

3132.4 --> 3139.839
creole creosote and suit

3136.319 --> 3139.839
learn something every day

3152.16 --> 3158.16
steamy who is rv that's russian vids

3155.599 --> 3158.1600000000003
it's this

3158.96 --> 3166.44
supposed flat earther conspiracy guy but

3162.0 --> 3166.44
he is like mega savage

3166.48 --> 3170.4
is literally always just creating

3168.88 --> 3172.48
paranoia

3170.4 --> 3175.04
i think he probably is genuinely

3172.48 --> 3175.04
paranoid

3176.559 --> 3180.96
and i would be too if i constantly was

3178.96 --> 3183.2
making up just

3180.96 --> 3185.44
[ __ ] slander about everybody

3183.2 --> 3190.359
including people that are supposedly on

3185.44 --> 3190.359
your side yeah i'd be paranoid too

3225.52 --> 3227.839
hmm

3228.079 --> 3233.599
yeah yeah borders boy yeah i know

3232.079 --> 3236.7200000000003
yeah basically

3233.599 --> 3237.6800000000003
cars running on coal

3236.72 --> 3239.7599999999998
really

3237.68 --> 3242.3999999999996
they were really dirty though

3239.76 --> 3242.4
but it worked

3246.319 --> 3253.2799999999997
it's like yeah if

3248.839 --> 3255.839
literally oil would be cut off

3253.28 --> 3257.8390000000004
completely right

3255.839 --> 3260.7999999999997
it's like a really bad situation then

3257.839 --> 3263.599
technically you could just

3260.8 --> 3265.76
start to modify cars

3263.599 --> 3267.44
with wood gasification

3265.76 --> 3268.8
because i mean wood is pretty much

3267.44 --> 3270.48
always around

3268.8 --> 3272.4
unless i guess you're in the middle of

3270.48 --> 3274.0
the desert but yeah over there there is

3272.4 --> 3277.559
always going to be oil in the

3274.0 --> 3277.559
neighborhood anyway

3282.559 --> 3289.6800000000003
right but that's why they had it in 1930

3286.799 --> 3291.7599999999998
because it was cut off they did yeah so

3289.68 --> 3296.0789999999997
it would like those types of

3291.76 --> 3296.079
modifications are born out of necessity

3300.16 --> 3305.52
wood burning trucks

3302.64 --> 3308.72
montana what you mean act trucks that

3305.52 --> 3308.72
actually run on that

3310.24 --> 3315.3999999999996
what

3312.0 --> 3315.4
modern trucks

3321.44 --> 3328.16
i mean i guess it could be like

3323.76 --> 3328.1600000000003
modernized and made pretty efficient

3329.359 --> 3334.839
that's interesting

3330.72 --> 3334.839
call the gasifier right

3335.92 --> 3339.6800000000003
hey stalin 8012 what am i doing today

3338.079 --> 3341.8390000000004
i'm doing good i was doing good

3339.68 --> 3344.48
yesterday

3341.839 --> 3346.24
yeah but then indeed that freaking [ __ ]

3344.48 --> 3349.839
kind of made me

3346.24 --> 3349.839
go ballistic

3352.96 --> 3357.599
right but today i figured out that there

3355.119 --> 3360.559
is a subscribers only mode

3357.599 --> 3362.88
so hopefully that will deter

3360.559 --> 3364.6400000000003
him from start nagging me to the same

3362.88 --> 3366.559
degree we'll see

3364.64 --> 3369.04
maybe he's not going to show up today uh

3366.559 --> 3373.3590000000004
if he will probably show up in like

3369.04 --> 3373.359
20 minutes from now he usually does

3373.95 --> 3380.52
[Music]

3375.52 --> 3380.52
they used enterocyte coal okay

3394.88 --> 3397.88
so

3404.88 --> 3411.359
that chrysler waited turbine car

3409.2 --> 3412.799
sounded like a jet

3411.359 --> 3415.68
huh

3412.799 --> 3419.319
a turbine car that's

3415.68 --> 3419.319
that's kind of crazy

3425.599 --> 3428.96
there would have been a very james bond

3428.0 --> 3431.599
ask

3428.96 --> 3434.0
type of car probably

3431.599 --> 3437.2000000000003
1963

3434.0 --> 3440.2
like ooh futurist oh now our cars are

3437.2 --> 3440.2
jets

3449.68 --> 3454.8799999999997
it's because the trolls really love you

3452.799 --> 3456.72
matthew hall i don't care

3454.88 --> 3461.1600000000003
they want to love me

3456.72 --> 3461.16
then send me money yo

3461.28 --> 3463.52
and then i'll

3462.48 --> 3466.72
like

3463.52 --> 3469.7599999999998
maybe start to halfway tolerate some of

3466.72 --> 3469.7599999999998
the things they say

3473.599 --> 3477.6800000000003
i mean i tolerate professor phil bell

3476.0 --> 3479.92
even though some of you like really

3477.68 --> 3482.799
can't stand him

3479.92 --> 3486.799
because he actually supports me guys he

3482.799 --> 3489.799
does send me paper not as much as

3486.799 --> 3489.799
like

3489.92 --> 3496.16
you guys but he does

3493.28 --> 3498.96
and i respect that

3496.16 --> 3500.839
right it does give you

3498.96 --> 3503.68
some wiggle

3500.839 --> 3506.799
room right but it doesn't allow you to

3503.68 --> 3509.2
bypass the general rule system that i

3506.799 --> 3509.2
apply

3511.04 --> 3515.52
so yeah if they're really such if

3513.04 --> 3518.96
they're so in love with me then freaking

3515.52 --> 3518.96
support me financially

3521.839 --> 3526.72
so i matthew i think that especially

3524.72 --> 3529.2
that one guy that's doing that and

3526.72 --> 3530.72
making like those calls and [ __ ] i don't

3529.2 --> 3533.4399999999996
think he loves me i think that he

3530.72 --> 3533.4399999999996
genuinely

3533.52 --> 3536.799
is just

3534.96 --> 3540.0
well probably a very depressed

3536.799 --> 3540.0
individual in general

3541.04 --> 3547.2799999999997
and he's really just trying to bully me

3544.72 --> 3549.1189999999997
to like make me look crazy

3547.28 --> 3551.52
because he thinks that that is like the

3549.119 --> 3555.319
ultimate thing that discredits me is if

3551.52 --> 3555.319
somebody gets angry

3558.96 --> 3564.319
completely overlooking that

3561.359 --> 3567.2799999999997
well nathan but me too

3564.319 --> 3567.2799999999997
have basically

3567.52 --> 3572.48
grasped

3569.2 --> 3574.96
the anger factor and actually

3572.48 --> 3577.92
constructively

3574.96 --> 3577.92
utilized it

3579.76 --> 3585.119
yeah

3581.68 --> 3586.799
i mean i am blatantly utilizing my anger

3585.119 --> 3589.119
when it arrives

3586.799 --> 3590.559
i go in a certain mode i have certain

3589.119 --> 3591.44
things that i do

3590.559 --> 3595.44
and i

3591.44 --> 3597.839
go out of it with with confidence

3595.44 --> 3599.839
because i still have

3597.839 --> 3602.16
the most important faculties available

3599.839 --> 3606.0
to me even when i am angry i don't get

3602.16 --> 3607.52
like completely blindsided

3606.0 --> 3610.64
i mean i guess

3607.52 --> 3612.16
such situations might be more inclined

3610.64 --> 3614.64
to happen

3612.16 --> 3617.1189999999997
if it's like involving

3614.64 --> 3619.04
my girlfriend if i would have one

3617.119 --> 3621.119
like if i if they

3619.04 --> 3623.2
got nagged or something and i was there

3621.119 --> 3625.04
and i noticed that they couldn't

3623.2 --> 3627.4399999999996
that they were really getting hurt by

3625.04 --> 3629.92
then you get to see the real freaking

3627.44 --> 3631.28
rage win

3629.92 --> 3633.119
and then

3631.28 --> 3636.0
not going to be as subtle

3633.119 --> 3638.88
right but in this case it's just people

3636.0 --> 3641.04
with blabber mouths

3638.88 --> 3643.119
setting the worst example for human

3641.04 --> 3644.24
behavior that you can find right and

3643.119 --> 3646.88
that just

3644.24 --> 3649.04
is like in direct opposition to what i

3646.88 --> 3651.76
personally want to achieve and that is

3649.04 --> 3654.48
the improvement of people's behavior

3651.76 --> 3656.4
based on self-awareness

3654.48 --> 3658.4
taking responsibility

3656.4 --> 3659.76
and just realizing

3658.4 --> 3662.2400000000002
the patterns

3659.76 --> 3664.3190000000004
the patterns of ascension and realizing

3662.24 --> 3665.52
that yeah if you actually climb that

3664.319 --> 3669.04
staircase

3665.52 --> 3671.92
you will bump into new insights that you

3669.04 --> 3673.599
will have to take the responsibility for

3671.92 --> 3677.52
and if you don't

3673.599 --> 3681.44
then you go on a sliding scale

3677.52 --> 3681.44
and start to turn into a grabbler

3682.72 --> 3690.0789999999997
and it's always going to be in your own

3686.4 --> 3692.88
disadvantage in the end

3690.079 --> 3695.6800000000003
right and the trolls these trolls are

3692.88 --> 3698.88
just so terrible is that they're never

3695.68 --> 3701.04
achieving anything they're just like

3698.88 --> 3703.2000000000003
it hurts that people have so much

3701.04 --> 3706.0
cohesion and purpose it hurts them

3703.2 --> 3707.7599999999998
because they can't get it

3706.0 --> 3710.319
but they're afraid to get it they don't

3707.76 --> 3712.6400000000003
want to get it or even if they could get

3710.319 --> 3714.5589999999997
it for a moment it just eludes them

3712.64 --> 3717.52
again they just lose it

3714.559 --> 3719.119
it drops out of their hands again

3717.52 --> 3721.839
they can't wield it

3719.119 --> 3724.88
so they then just end up super jealous

3721.839 --> 3727.839
and trying to ruin it for others that's

3724.88 --> 3727.839
what bullies do

3736.319 --> 3742.0
my most absolute patchy

3738.64 --> 3743.7599999999998
yeah well i'm surprised i even have

3742.0 --> 3746.0
a mustache

3743.76 --> 3747.6800000000003
i never thought that i i thought most of

3746.0 --> 3750.0
my life that i couldn't even properly

3747.68 --> 3752.839
get one because i'm an elf

3750.0 --> 3756.48
i don't have a lot of facial hair except

3752.839 --> 3756.48
for these

3756.72 --> 3759.839
i'm very happy with that

3760.559 --> 3765.2000000000003
my eyebrows

3762.079 --> 3767.119
right but over here like i'm never gonna

3765.2 --> 3769.5989999999997
grow like a real

3767.119 --> 3770.799
man beard and never gonna happen this is

3769.599 --> 3773.119
not a cat

3770.799 --> 3776.0
i can't

3773.119 --> 3778.0
right but i can't have a mustache

3776.0 --> 3778.88
and i can't even have it grow a little

3778.0 --> 3781.359
long

3778.88 --> 3783.52
if i want

3781.359 --> 3785.44
but don't get sick of it getting in my

3783.52 --> 3787.599
teeth and [ __ ] because that can that

3785.44 --> 3789.44
does actually happen every now and then

3787.599 --> 3791.92
because it's pretty long on the sides

3789.44 --> 3793.28
but i'm just i'm just trying to do it

3791.92 --> 3794.839
you know

3793.28 --> 3799.2000000000003
just doing what i'm

3794.839 --> 3799.2
doing i'm not afraid

3801.76 --> 3805.3590000000004
thank you for the troll alert though

3805.76 --> 3812.6400000000003
dash looks good yeah it looks fine

3808.24 --> 3814.16
i mean it's not like the super mustachey

3812.64 --> 3818.16
right but it's

3814.16 --> 3818.16
cool i'm i'm happy with it

3818.48 --> 3821.52
i'm not getting like

3820.559 --> 3824.48
looks

3821.52 --> 3826.16
i mean girls i do get like

3824.48 --> 3828.319
where they basically look at me they're

3826.16 --> 3829.92
like hmm

3828.319 --> 3832.88
and that's good

3829.92 --> 3832.88
that's a good sign

3833.119 --> 3837.839
if i get them to compliment contemplate

3835.839 --> 3840.799
whether they think i'm attractive or not

3837.839 --> 3840.799
that's a good thing

3842.079 --> 3847.2000000000003
and i've had that more since i got my

3844.559 --> 3847.2000000000003
mustache

3848.48 --> 3851.72
so yeah

3857.039 --> 3861.8390000000004
see but this again

3858.88 --> 3861.839
like i like

3862.079 --> 3867.039
i like sporadic troll comments like that

3865.039 --> 3868.2400000000002
you see i did that yesterday too it's

3867.039 --> 3870.4
like

3868.24 --> 3872.8799999999997
look in the army i'm gonna try to bully

3870.4 --> 3874.64
you it literally calls himself that it's

3872.88 --> 3877.839
like dude

3874.64 --> 3877.839
it doesn't really work

3878.079 --> 3883.8390000000004
and i can actually just do it

3881.119 --> 3886.48
i can use it it's

3883.839 --> 3888.319
it's only really a problem to me when

3886.48 --> 3891.839
it's constant

3888.319 --> 3894.88
spam when i can't read um when it like

3891.839 --> 3899.839
outnumbers the amount of messages

3894.88 --> 3899.839
from yeah guys that genuinely follow me

3900.079 --> 3904.96
right then it starts to really annoy me

3905.52 --> 3910.88
but if it's just a troll sometimes

3908.079 --> 3913.28
trying to say something mean

3910.88 --> 3916.2400000000002
i can just like oh thanks thanks for the

3913.28 --> 3918.7200000000003
opportunity to prove how confident i am

3916.24 --> 3922.319
about myself thank you

3918.72 --> 3924.24
i mean you project your and your lack of

3922.319 --> 3926.24
confidence onto me

3924.24 --> 3928.799
to hope to take away my confidence but

3926.24 --> 3932.799
all it does is give me the opportunity

3928.799 --> 3935.119
to prove how confident i actually am

3932.799 --> 3937.839
yeah

3935.119 --> 3939.52
so thank you for the opportunity

3937.839 --> 3943.359
troll

3939.52 --> 3943.359
just don't freaking spam me

3945.92 --> 3949.2000000000003
right i don't even need to ban you like

3947.839 --> 3952.0
that

3949.2 --> 3955.68
bobby loves me i don't care i don't care

3952.0 --> 3959.96
for his gay infatuations jeff gassett if

3955.68 --> 3959.96
he wants to hang around that's fine

3983.359 --> 3988.16
40 of us power comes from natural gas

3986.0 --> 3992.039
turbine generators it does george

3988.16 --> 3992.0389999999998
sanford i didn't know that

3996.64 --> 3999.77
[Music]

4024.88 --> 4029.039
wow seeking star you're ready for a

4026.799 --> 4029.0389999999998
fight

4029.119 --> 4033.6800000000003
oh but yeah they do get after the women

4031.52 --> 4036.24
like women make them squirt more than

4033.68 --> 4036.24
anybody

4040.72 --> 4045.1189999999997
flat earth women are like

4042.96 --> 4046.839
they always get like twice to three

4045.119 --> 4048.799
times the amount of

4046.839 --> 4051.92
hassle

4048.799 --> 4053.92
flat earth men get for some reason

4051.92 --> 4055.92
i guess because there's not too many of

4053.92 --> 4057.839
those there's not too many flat earth

4055.92 --> 4058.96
women that are like actually active on

4057.839 --> 4061.7599999999998
media

4058.96 --> 4061.76
compared to men

4061.839 --> 4065.48
when i was a man

4083.44 --> 4086.44
hmm

4094.64 --> 4099.2789999999995
go from off to full power output in

4096.88 --> 4099.279
seconds

4099.92 --> 4105.839
that's pretty cool george i didn't know

4102.0 --> 4105.839
that there was so much

4106.64 --> 4111.359
gas based

4108.159 --> 4111.3589999999995
electric generators

4112.0 --> 4115.199
i mean it makes sense to me

4115.6 --> 4118.6
i'm

4119.04 --> 4123.44
i'm wondering though like why

4122.159 --> 4126.159
is it

4123.44 --> 4129.599999999999
still more efficient to just use natural

4126.159 --> 4133.759
gas and not switch to

4129.6 --> 4136.319
creating hydrogen from from electrolysis

4133.759 --> 4136.319
on water

4137.92 --> 4145.04
that's what i'm wondering like because

4140.64 --> 4147.04
hydrogen gas engines are pretty much

4145.04 --> 4150.319
super clean like all that's going to

4147.04 --> 4150.319
come out of that is water

4151.679 --> 4156.719
and yeah guess how much water there is

4153.839 --> 4158.799
around a lot

4156.719 --> 4160.319
and if you're going to be at a power

4158.799 --> 4162.0
generator

4160.319 --> 4164.719
well guess what you're going to have a

4162.0 --> 4166.96
lot of electricity right there in order

4164.719 --> 4168.56
to create the electrolysis in order to

4166.96 --> 4170.4800000000005
provide the gas

4168.56 --> 4172.64
that you're actually using so it's like

4170.48 --> 4175.12
this

4172.64 --> 4177.6
internal cycle you could create

4175.12 --> 4180.239
uh so i'm wondering like where is where

4177.6 --> 4182.4800000000005
are the hydrogen electric plants

4180.239 --> 4185.44
where are they

4182.48 --> 4189.2789999999995
takes a lot of power to make hydrogen no

4185.44 --> 4190.96
no george sanford it actually doesn't

4189.279 --> 4192.400000000001
it doesn't anymore

4190.96 --> 4194.64
there's a lot of engineering

4192.4 --> 4196.48
developments that if people have done

4194.64 --> 4199.360000000001
like even in their own

4196.48 --> 4200.639999999999
spare time in their garages

4199.36 --> 4204.799999999999
that have

4200.64 --> 4207.360000000001
made hydrogen creation become a lot more

4204.8 --> 4210.2390000000005
efficient than it was like 30 years ago

4207.36 --> 4212.639999999999
a lot more right 30 years ago was still

4210.239 --> 4213.44
like oh we have to use platinum plates

4212.64 --> 4216.400000000001
and

4213.44 --> 4218.0
was super expensive to get a good height

4216.4 --> 4219.12
oh

4218.0 --> 4221.92
it was

4219.12 --> 4225.5199999999995
yeah my camera is frozen i see

4221.92 --> 4227.92
it was super expensive to get a good

4225.52 --> 4230.96
hydrogen generator and it would suck up

4227.92 --> 4232.8
a lot of electricity but it's like

4230.96 --> 4234.719
i

4232.8 --> 4237.52
threw somebody

4234.719 --> 4240.0
no like i knew somebody

4237.52 --> 4241.92
fellow conspiracy theorist that also we

4240.0 --> 4243.679
got into flat earth and then he was the

4241.92 --> 4246.08
one actually threatened and then stepped

4243.679 --> 4248.32
out of it and they kind of became a ball

4246.08 --> 4250.239
earth kent hovinder

4248.32 --> 4252.4
like he he was afraid to talk about it

4250.239 --> 4256.0
after that point

4252.4 --> 4256.0
the hell is going on with my camera

4256.4 --> 4262.239
this is weird

4259.36 --> 4262.239
let me reset

4263.6 --> 4265.92
right

4268.4 --> 4273.759999999999
but he knew a guy because he was an

4271.36 --> 4277.839999999999
actual physicist

4273.76 --> 4280.2390000000005
and engineer guy from a university

4277.84 --> 4281.84
and he knew somebody who was literally

4280.239 --> 4284.718999999999
being

4281.84 --> 4287.12
in the process of patenting

4284.719 --> 4290.159
an invention that he had made where you

4287.12 --> 4291.599999999999
could make hydrogen cells extremely

4290.159 --> 4294.159
cheap for like

4291.6 --> 4294.159000000001
what was it

4294.8 --> 4298.84
like a 50th

4297.28 --> 4302.719
of the cost

4298.84 --> 4305.28
one like 50 times cheaper

4302.719 --> 4307.28
and it was super efficient i never

4305.28 --> 4309.28
really heard what happened after that it

4307.28 --> 4311.44
could very well be that it was literally

4309.28 --> 4312.48
bought up by a mega corporation and then

4311.44 --> 4315.28
put

4312.48 --> 4317.199
in some safe in some vault somewhere not

4315.28 --> 4320.8
to be used right

4317.199 --> 4320.799999999999
but i know it's possible

4321.44 --> 4326.839999999999
i know it's possible to really get very

4324.08 --> 4329.6
efficient hydrogen gas out of

4326.84 --> 4332.8
water to the point where you could

4329.6 --> 4334.719
actually use that to drive

4332.8 --> 4338.56
gas-based engines

4334.719 --> 4339.84
for cars and i guess for electric plants

4338.56 --> 4342.320000000001
so i'm like

4339.84 --> 4344.159000000001
where is it then i mean okay yeah sure

4342.32 --> 4346.48
we still have plenty of natural gas

4344.159 --> 4347.759999999999
around them all for that natural gas is

4346.48 --> 4349.678999999999
super clean

4347.76 --> 4352.0
i mean what else are you gonna do with

4349.679 --> 4352.96
it just let it vent off in the in the in

4352.0 --> 4356.0
the air

4352.96 --> 4358.32
right it's gonna be there's gas there

4356.0 --> 4361.04
it's there like yeah if you just let it

4358.32 --> 4364.0
go it's just gonna vent off in

4361.04 --> 4366.239
in the realm so why not use it

4364.0 --> 4367.04
right

4366.239 --> 4369.5199999999995
but

4367.04 --> 4371.12
if there was none available then you

4369.52 --> 4374.88
could technically

4371.12 --> 4378.0
have hydrogen based

4374.88 --> 4378.0
gas engines

4379.04 --> 4384.48
because that is viable now to do it is

4382.48 --> 4387.599999999999
actually more efficient you just need

4384.48 --> 4387.599999999999
good water source

4389.44 --> 4394.0
constant water influx

4392.0 --> 4396.32
and then you basically have unlimited

4394.0 --> 4396.32
power

4397.28 --> 4402.239
it's super clean

4400.32 --> 4404.48
right

4402.239 --> 4406.32
there's literally only water coming out

4404.48 --> 4408.239
of that only water

4406.32 --> 4411.759999999999
so there's no like

4408.239 --> 4413.36
carbon molecule types that are gonna

4411.76 --> 4415.92
over time

4413.36 --> 4418.799999999999
cause wearing

4415.92 --> 4421.1990000000005
right it's just water

4418.8 --> 4422.400000000001
you can literally

4421.199 --> 4425.44
even

4422.4 --> 4429.839999999999
design engines based on that so that

4425.44 --> 4432.0
like if it were more like uh what is it

4429.84 --> 4435.4400000000005
carbon plastic

4432.0 --> 4439.12
hybrid material something engines

4435.44 --> 4440.96
so that it would literally like water

4439.12 --> 4443.28
wouldn't even cause any kind of rust

4440.96 --> 4445.2390000000005
under extreme temperatures right and

4443.28 --> 4448.32
then you literally have like an

4445.239 --> 4451.44
indestructible engine that runs

4448.32 --> 4451.44
on hydrogen gas

4452.08 --> 4456.719
because it's never gonna wear out

4454.4 --> 4458.32
this is just water coming out it's never

4456.719 --> 4462.64
gonna

4458.32 --> 4465.759999999999
like give up you could make that

4462.64 --> 4467.1990000000005
and then basically have a

4465.76 --> 4469.84
renewable

4467.199 --> 4469.839999999999
source of energy

4471.12 --> 4478.679
you don't even have to really exchange

4473.52 --> 4478.679
much in what's already there out there

4487.12 --> 4494.48
and romanian and hydroclerk and a dude

4491.6 --> 4497.76
yeah george sanford uh

4494.48 --> 4500.239
that's really cute

4497.76 --> 4502.320000000001
i bet you though that there's not just

4500.239 --> 4504.48
gonna be hydrogen coming out of that

4502.32 --> 4507.28
there's also going to be a lot of

4504.48 --> 4508.5599999999995
chemical waste coming out of that

4507.28 --> 4512.48
right that

4508.56 --> 4516.4800000000005
so let's not do that

4512.48 --> 4517.919999999999
use aluminium and hydrochloric acid

4516.48 --> 4521.04
let's just use

4517.92 --> 4524.32
water it's a lot cleaner

4521.04 --> 4525.36
right it's going to split up in the gas

4524.32 --> 4528.239
no

4525.36 --> 4530.239
junk no chemical remnant right that's

4528.239 --> 4531.919999999999
that's the main problem

4530.239 --> 4532.879999999999
with gasoline

4531.92 --> 4533.84
fuel

4532.88 --> 4535.4400000000005
is that

4533.84 --> 4537.1990000000005
when you have the crude oil and you're

4535.44 --> 4540.159
gonna split it up you're gonna break it

4537.199 --> 4542.48
up and create the gasoline you have

4540.159 --> 4545.5199999999995
another side product

4542.48 --> 4548.4
it keeps building up it's really gross

4545.52 --> 4550.96
it's really bad for nature right

4548.4 --> 4553.599999999999
so don't then just like oh we can make

4550.96 --> 4555.28
hydrogen gas based oh let's take

4553.6 --> 4558.400000000001
chemicals and put them together they

4555.28 --> 4561.12
create hydrogen so we can build up more

4558.4 --> 4562.639999999999
toxic waste no that was the whole

4561.12 --> 4565.5199999999995
freaking point

4562.64 --> 4568.08
of a water engine is that you don't have

4565.52 --> 4572.1990000000005
freaking chemical waste buildup that was

4568.08 --> 4572.199
the whole point of it

4594.64 --> 4598.159000000001
i'm gonna give you a wrench

4599.6 --> 4602.96
i've seen you around for a while

4606.56 --> 4612.1990000000005
they even gave me paypals

4609.199 --> 4612.199
so

4651.52 --> 4657.120000000001
i shouldn't use salt as electrolyte

4655.28 --> 4658.159
well

4657.12 --> 4660.48
i'll bet

4658.159 --> 4663.28
that there's you could probably even

4660.48 --> 4666.0
improve on that process right

4663.28 --> 4669.759999999999
i mean as i said

4666.0 --> 4671.84
via via i knew a guy

4669.76 --> 4673.360000000001
that has had like

4671.84 --> 4676.4800000000005
invented

4673.36 --> 4680.639999999999
a hydrogen cell like a hydrogen

4676.48 --> 4680.639999999999
generator that was super efficient

4681.6 --> 4685.76
so

4682.88 --> 4687.4400000000005
and yeah that's just somebody developing

4685.76 --> 4688.56
that on their own time that's not even

4687.44 --> 4691.199
like

4688.56 --> 4693.52
funded development

4691.199 --> 4695.759999999999
by a mega corporation or something right

4693.52 --> 4699.4400000000005
then you get like millions and you get a

4695.76 --> 4699.4400000000005
laboratory etc and then

4699.6 --> 4703.92
right it's just what somebody did on

4701.679 --> 4705.76
their own time so if that is possible

4703.92 --> 4708.2390000000005
then i bet you

4705.76 --> 4711.12
you can eventually make hydrogen

4708.239 --> 4714.12
generators that are like super super

4711.12 --> 4714.12
clean

4732.48 --> 4736.159
hydrogen cells yeah yeah once in a

4734.48 --> 4738.32
lifetime

4736.159 --> 4740.239
bus route yeah there's someone there was

4738.32 --> 4743.36
that in the netherlands as well where

4740.239 --> 4744.959999999999
they tried to run on hydrogen cells

4743.36 --> 4748.639999999999
and then

4744.96 --> 4751.44
oh no it's dangerous

4748.64 --> 4754.719
we can't do this for some reason

4751.44 --> 4754.719
and they just canceled it

4754.88 --> 4758.64
just out of nowhere like nobody wanted

4756.96 --> 4761.199
that to be cancelled and they just

4758.64 --> 4763.04
canceled it

4761.199 --> 4766.08
had it roll out and then they canceled

4763.04 --> 4766.08
it it's ridiculous

4769.12 --> 4774.0
right and now then they transition oh no

4771.76 --> 4778.2390000000005
it's all electric so now we got these

4774.0 --> 4778.239
electric buses driving around

4778.64 --> 4784.320000000001
right and yeah they're

4780.88 --> 4784.32
they're a lot less efficient

4785.36 --> 4791.44
because electric cars in general are

4787.92 --> 4793.679
less efficient a lot less efficient they

4791.44 --> 4795.678999999999
waste more energy

4793.679 --> 4798.08
yeah more electricity

4795.679 --> 4801.679
a lot more

4798.08 --> 4803.12
it costs a lot more electricity

4801.679 --> 4806.56
technically

4803.12 --> 4807.84
to have electric type cars and etc

4806.56 --> 4810.159000000001
drive around

4807.84 --> 4812.639
cost more energy than it would cause

4810.159 --> 4814.48
energy to actually create

4812.639 --> 4816.84
hydrogen

4814.48 --> 4820.959999999999
cells

4816.84 --> 4823.360000000001
whatever four cars to run on

4820.96 --> 4825.12
and then it would be no waste either

4823.36 --> 4827.839999999999
just a little bit more moist in the air

4825.12 --> 4827.84
probably that's it

4829.199 --> 4833.36
right the electric vehicle situation is

4831.92 --> 4835.6
a terrible

4833.36 --> 4837.759999999999
terrible development

4835.6 --> 4840.2390000000005
all it's done really is

4837.76 --> 4842.4800000000005
stimulate industry like oh rare

4840.239 --> 4844.48
materials oh yeah

4842.48 --> 4845.5199999999995
right that's the real thing it's done

4844.48 --> 4847.12
it's just

4845.52 --> 4849.4400000000005
driven

4847.12 --> 4851.84
mining schemes and [ __ ]

4849.44 --> 4855.12
that's it that's what electric cars have

4851.84 --> 4858.719
done driven mining schemes

4855.12 --> 4861.5199999999995
because it's not actually electrically

4858.719 --> 4864.159
efficient it's less efficient it's an

4861.52 --> 4865.84
energy wasting system i mean

4864.159 --> 4867.599999999999
yeah it could be kind of cool to have

4865.84 --> 4870.159000000001
your electric thing but if you're gonna

4867.6 --> 4874.08
like standardize that [ __ ]

4870.159 --> 4875.92
incentivize it it on the long run

4874.08 --> 4879.5199999999995
becomes less

4875.92 --> 4881.6
efficient you waste more energy

4879.52 --> 4883.120000000001
all that energy

4881.6 --> 4885.52
is still going to be

4883.12 --> 4887.12
made somehow right and what's it going

4885.52 --> 4889.280000000001
to run do that with

4887.12 --> 4891.28
coal plants and nuclear plants and all

4889.28 --> 4892.4
that

4891.28 --> 4896.4
so

4892.4 --> 4900.44
and gas turbine plants i guess

4896.4 --> 4900.44
so it doesn't actually work

4903.04 --> 4908.08
as a measure to make things more

4905.52 --> 4910.56
environmentally friendly it doesn't work

4908.08 --> 4912.8
it just costs more energy

4910.56 --> 4914.56
it's going to create an energy crisis if

4912.8 --> 4917.04
it keeps persisting

4914.56 --> 4919.360000000001
through industry

4917.04 --> 4919.36
yeah

4919.44 --> 4922.719
looking around yet

4921.679 --> 4925.4400000000005
noticed

4922.719 --> 4928.719
prices going up yeah that's including

4925.44 --> 4930.799999999999
like gas prices going up for gasoline

4928.719 --> 4932.4
that's not just for your car or your

4930.8 --> 4937.360000000001
truck yeah

4932.4 --> 4939.679
that includes the electric generators

4937.36 --> 4942.08
the electric generators powering your

4939.679 --> 4943.4400000000005
electric cars yeah

4942.08 --> 4944.48
yeah

4943.44 --> 4947.839999999999
that's

4944.48 --> 4950.32
gonna end up with a big bill

4947.84 --> 4952.88
because you wanted to be environmentally

4950.32 --> 4955.679
friendly but effectively played into a

4952.88 --> 4957.04
industrial scheme mega corporation

4955.679 --> 4959.04
scheme

4957.04 --> 4962.56
that has caused you to become

4959.04 --> 4965.44
less energy efficient and now now you're

4962.56 --> 4967.4400000000005
gonna pay you're gonna pay right now

4965.44 --> 4970.239
because guess what's happening

4967.44 --> 4973.36
energy price is going up yeah you're

4970.239 --> 4974.239
happy with your electric car now

4973.36 --> 4975.839999999999
no

4974.239 --> 4978.48
you aren't aren't you

4975.84 --> 4979.679
yeah because energy prices gone up and

4978.48 --> 4982.959999999999
that means

4979.679 --> 4984.32
electric car owners become screwed

4982.96 --> 4986.4
yeah

4984.32 --> 4987.92
that's your environmentally friendly

4986.4 --> 4990.92
policy there

4987.92 --> 4990.92
huh

5011.92 --> 5016.0
yeah solar no solar panels can be pretty

5014.719 --> 5019.36
good

5016.0 --> 5021.36
but it's not it's a support system right

5019.36 --> 5023.92
just like windmills are right if you

5021.36 --> 5026.0
have like a farm

5023.92 --> 5028.2390000000005
well you could basically put up one

5026.0 --> 5030.4
electric windmill

5028.239 --> 5032.159
to have a bit of support energy

5030.4 --> 5034.32
especially if it's like a really flat

5032.159 --> 5035.5199999999995
land and there's going to be wind right

5034.32 --> 5037.5199999999995
local

5035.52 --> 5040.159000000001
as well as like oh you're in a sunny

5037.52 --> 5042.56
region you're like a nevada or something

5040.159 --> 5044.799999999999
right yeah solar panels dude freaking

5042.56 --> 5047.4400000000005
solar panels but where

5044.8 --> 5048.159000000001
not in some remote field

5047.44 --> 5050.08
no

5048.159 --> 5052.239
on your freaking roof

5050.08 --> 5054.5599999999995
because it's close

5052.239 --> 5058.159
and then it's not wasted and then it

5054.56 --> 5059.84
doesn't cost as much right local

5058.159 --> 5061.759999999999
all these

5059.84 --> 5063.679
supposed environmentally friendly

5061.76 --> 5065.84
systems yeah they are they have their

5063.679 --> 5068.56
function but you have to keep it close

5065.84 --> 5070.4800000000005
to where the energy is going to be used

5068.56 --> 5073.120000000001
you can't have like a

5070.48 --> 5075.12
compartmentalized centralized system

5073.12 --> 5077.36
like all the solar panels are here and

5075.12 --> 5078.719
they're going to feed in a pipeline

5077.36 --> 5080.08
electric

5078.719 --> 5081.6
pipeline

5080.08 --> 5083.92
to a city like

5081.6 --> 5086.639
100 kilometers away because then it's

5083.92 --> 5089.28
all lost all that energy is all lost

5086.639 --> 5092.4800000000005
right the more distance it has to go

5089.28 --> 5096.08
from a windmill or a solar panel the

5092.48 --> 5098.718999999999
less you actually receive from it

5096.08 --> 5099.679
that's why they are useful

5098.719 --> 5102.4800000000005
on

5099.679 --> 5105.12
the very location the electricity is

5102.48 --> 5107.199
going to be used then it works

5105.12 --> 5109.28
that's the only way

5107.199 --> 5111.28
it works

5109.28 --> 5114.48
if it's going to be presented in any

5111.28 --> 5116.8
other way it's going to be a scam

5114.48 --> 5118.638999999999
it's going to be an industrial scam to

5116.8 --> 5121.04
make you pay a whole bunch of money

5118.639 --> 5123.04
through taxes probably

5121.04 --> 5126.08
and then end up with

5123.04 --> 5128.4
not efficient energy and a big bill and

5126.08 --> 5130.5599999999995
probably a lot of maintenance cost yeah

5128.4 --> 5131.679
that's what's going to happen

5130.56 --> 5133.76
because

5131.679 --> 5136.159
all the natural

5133.76 --> 5141.6
environmentally friendly electric

5136.159 --> 5142.638999999999
systems have to all be applied locally

5141.6 --> 5144.8
like

5142.639 --> 5147.04
in the spot it's going to be used like

5144.8 --> 5150.320000000001
right next to the socket of the

5147.04 --> 5152.8
industrial machine right next to it

5150.32 --> 5154.5599999999995
right you have to gonna have this big

5152.8 --> 5156.8
electric engine that's gonna do

5154.56 --> 5159.360000000001
something right

5156.8 --> 5162.719
whatever it is

5159.36 --> 5164.48
have the solar panel have the windmill

5162.719 --> 5166.32
right next to it

5164.48 --> 5169.5599999999995
then it's actually gonna work then it's

5166.32 --> 5169.5599999999995
gonna help

5170.0 --> 5175.52
right this is something by the way that

5172.239 --> 5176.959999999999
is very well understood in germany

5175.52 --> 5179.52
right

5176.96 --> 5182.96
that's they don't have like solar panel

5179.52 --> 5183.76
fields that kind of nonsense

5182.96 --> 5186.719
right

5183.76 --> 5189.1990000000005
or windmills like the netherlands

5186.719 --> 5191.6
it's complete waste what we did complete

5189.199 --> 5193.599999999999
waste it is it's terrible

5191.6 --> 5195.120000000001
everybody's dissatisfied with it in

5193.6 --> 5198.88
germany they got it because they

5195.12 --> 5200.96
subsidized companies farmers etc and

5198.88 --> 5203.679
even

5200.96 --> 5205.76
individuals with their households to get

5203.679 --> 5208.719
solar panels

5205.76 --> 5211.04
and then use it right there right

5208.719 --> 5214.2390000000005
locally because that's the way it works

5211.04 --> 5215.92
it worked much better for them

5214.239 --> 5219.28
because they actually applied the

5215.92 --> 5220.88
environmentally electric technologies

5219.28 --> 5222.96
the way you should

5220.88 --> 5225.679
local right there where you're going to

5222.96 --> 5227.6
use it

5225.679 --> 5229.92
so it worked out a lot better they have

5227.6 --> 5233.1990000000005
less cost because of that compared to

5229.92 --> 5235.76
other countries that have attempted

5233.199 --> 5238.638999999999
to integrate environmentally friendly

5235.76 --> 5240.2390000000005
electric systems

5238.639 --> 5242.8
like the netherlands who completely

5240.239 --> 5245.28
ruined it with their stupid windmills

5242.8 --> 5248.159000000001
they're just a giant waste

5245.28 --> 5248.159
don't do anything

5249.199 --> 5254.159
right because they have to have fields

5251.36 --> 5257.12
of them instead of just saying no you

5254.159 --> 5259.44
want a windmill energy

5257.12 --> 5261.5199999999995
on the farm and that's the way it is

5259.44 --> 5263.678999999999
that's the way it's gonna work otherwise

5261.52 --> 5264.4800000000005
it's gonna just be wasted it's just

5263.679 --> 5267.28
gonna

5264.48 --> 5269.839999999999
squash a bunch of birds all the time

5267.28 --> 5271.84
and then break down and then yeah you

5269.84 --> 5273.360000000001
have all this plastic waste that you

5271.84 --> 5276.159000000001
can't do anything with you're just gonna

5273.36 --> 5279.96
bury it in a landfill somewhere

5276.159 --> 5279.96
and it's a giant waste

5281.12 --> 5283.5199999999995
anyway

5287.28 --> 5292.48
does the netherlands utilize modern

5288.8 --> 5292.4800000000005
windmills for energy production

5293.679 --> 5297.28
well they have went

5295.6 --> 5299.84
through that they've been doing that for

5297.28 --> 5301.599999999999
quite a while like oh look at how modern

5299.84 --> 5304.96
environmentally friendly we are but we

5301.6 --> 5306.159000000001
have we have giant landfills now with

5304.96 --> 5309.159
broken

5306.159 --> 5309.159
windmills

5309.28 --> 5312.639
it's a giant disaster

5312.96 --> 5319.199
an environmental disaster

5317.12 --> 5321.679
right so i think that

5319.199 --> 5322.719
they're probably going to move away from

5321.679 --> 5324.4800000000005
that

5322.719 --> 5326.719
on the other hand there have also been

5324.48 --> 5328.879999999999
technological developments to make them

5326.719 --> 5331.36
a little bit more efficient

5328.88 --> 5333.6
so they won't be they'll be a little bit

5331.36 --> 5335.199
more recyclable they won't break down as

5333.6 --> 5337.76
quickly

5335.199 --> 5342.239
but it's still not

5337.76 --> 5343.679
it's still not viable in my in my future

5342.239 --> 5345.12
view on this

5343.679 --> 5347.76
my vision

5345.12 --> 5349.679
still not viable to make freaking fields

5347.76 --> 5351.360000000001
out of windmills

5349.679 --> 5352.96
right

5351.36 --> 5354.4
that sort of thing is just never going

5352.96 --> 5356.8
to work

5354.4 --> 5358.96
you want to go through natural like

5356.8 --> 5361.92
solar energy or wind energy it's going

5358.96 --> 5363.679
to have to be on the spot where the

5361.92 --> 5366.08
electricity is going to be used or it's

5363.679 --> 5369.04
just going to be wasted

5366.08 --> 5369.04
just going to be wasted

5373.12 --> 5379.04
right so in my opinion hydroelectrics

5375.84 --> 5382.92
are still

5379.04 --> 5382.92
a much better solution

5402.32 --> 5408.08
what the hell

5404.32 --> 5410.0
trying to melt gold powder in a potato

5408.08 --> 5412.0
what

5410.0 --> 5415.0
why the hell would you do that can a

5412.0 --> 5415.0
bear

5423.28 --> 5426.599999999999
like why

5434.56 --> 5438.2390000000005
nuclear power of don't say please very

5436.4 --> 5440.96
good yeah i agree

5438.239 --> 5440.959999999999
absolutely

5441.28 --> 5445.92
and there's very

5443.04 --> 5449.84
modern nuclear power plant designs that

5445.92 --> 5449.84
are incredibly safe

5451.36 --> 5456.0
like that are just

5452.8 --> 5459.639
built to basically not get destroyed if

5456.0 --> 5459.639
something goes wrong

5464.719 --> 5469.36
like any nuclear power plant with the

5467.679 --> 5471.679
risks that are supposedly there of

5469.36 --> 5474.159
overheating of the rods and all that

5471.679 --> 5476.0
should always be that oh if it keeps

5474.159 --> 5478.638999999999
running it just keeps running and but if

5476.0 --> 5482.239
it then turns off or something breaks

5478.639 --> 5485.12
that automatically as a passive action

5482.239 --> 5486.239
everything is put in a safe spot

5485.12 --> 5488.719
like that

5486.239 --> 5491.44
the rods would automatically sink

5488.719 --> 5493.679
or spread out to basically make sure

5491.44 --> 5497.36
that if everything is turned off that

5493.679 --> 5499.6
like it it would never be able to melt

5497.36 --> 5499.599999999999
right

5500.0 --> 5505.84
real safety mechanisms those are those

5503.12 --> 5507.84
exist they have existed for a while

5505.84 --> 5510.56
those designs and they have already been

5507.84 --> 5512.4800000000005
built here and there

5510.56 --> 5514.400000000001
right

5512.48 --> 5516.239
the majority right now of power plants

5514.4 --> 5517.679
as far as i remember

5516.239 --> 5520.32
haven't really been modernized so

5517.679 --> 5521.84
there's like 80 year old designs and

5520.32 --> 5524.5599999999995
[ __ ]

5521.84 --> 5527.84
like really old

5524.56 --> 5529.52
and metal fatigue and [ __ ] start to

5527.84 --> 5531.12
happen it's

5529.52 --> 5533.120000000001
it's kind of

5531.12 --> 5535.679
risky

5533.12 --> 5539.199
you should really in my opinion have

5535.679 --> 5542.4800000000005
those closed down and new ones built

5539.199 --> 5542.48
of the modern time

5544.08 --> 5548.639
because yeah

5546.4 --> 5550.239
these things are just gonna break down

5548.639 --> 5552.8
one way or the other

5550.239 --> 5552.799999999999
eventually

5553.76 --> 5557.159000000001
the old ones

5565.12 --> 5569.28
nuclear is not what you are told

5568.0 --> 5572.08
yeah

5569.28 --> 5574.159
and atom cannot be i don't know

5572.08 --> 5576.159
i don't know how that works there is

5574.159 --> 5578.96
something going on but

5576.159 --> 5581.5199999999995
yeah it's mostly just material uranium

5578.96 --> 5582.8
just heating water that's it

5581.52 --> 5586.320000000001
atoms doing

5582.8 --> 5586.320000000001
what you don't know that

5587.84 --> 5591.6
stern is still true they're always

5590.159 --> 5594.879999999999
trying

5591.6 --> 5596.88
yeah cern is just a bunch of

5594.88 --> 5598.96
bunch of wizards

5596.88 --> 5601.28
bad wizards that are conjuring up

5598.96 --> 5603.679
[ __ ]

5601.28 --> 5606.159
from giant magnetic experiments where

5603.679 --> 5607.12
afterward they look at squiggly lines

5606.159 --> 5609.199
yeah

5607.12 --> 5611.44
that's certain they're not proving

5609.199 --> 5614.799999999999
anything

5611.44 --> 5617.199
it's just like a science

5614.8 --> 5619.6
tea leaf reading process that's what

5617.199 --> 5619.599999999999
that is

5625.28 --> 5629.32
oh man time has flown

5630.639 --> 5635.679
solar panels probably last longer than

5632.719 --> 5638.679
car batteries depending on the design of

5635.679 --> 5638.679
them

5644.0 --> 5649.12
you know there are several there's been

5646.159 --> 5650.879999999999
a lot of developments in solar panels as

5649.12 --> 5652.96
well

5650.88 --> 5656.56
and there is like

5652.96 --> 5659.84
really efficient forms of it

5656.56 --> 5659.84
that are rather like

5660.96 --> 5666.719
quick solar panel but that that does run

5664.239 --> 5669.599999999999
out it doesn't last like forever but

5666.719 --> 5672.4800000000005
it's really cheap and it's not dirty

5669.6 --> 5675.84
there's all kinds of weird solar panels

5672.48 --> 5678.239
this yeah technological

5675.84 --> 5682.32
developments that have happened in the

5678.239 --> 5682.32
last what is it 20 years or so

5682.4 --> 5687.44
so yeah we're still seeing the standard

5685.679 --> 5689.28
solar panels right what we're all

5687.44 --> 5691.36
familiar with like

5689.28 --> 5693.679
big boards glass

5691.36 --> 5696.32
with the squares and all that like

5693.679 --> 5698.639
that's one type of solar panel and it's

5696.32 --> 5701.679
kind of gross they have chemicals in

5698.639 --> 5703.52
them it's actually

5701.679 --> 5704.88
not very environmentally friendly but

5703.52 --> 5706.56
that's one

5704.88 --> 5710.159000000001
type

5706.56 --> 5713.1990000000005
right there's other types of solar panel

5710.159 --> 5713.199
technology now

5713.36 --> 5717.599999999999
and i haven't really seen them being

5715.04 --> 5720.88
applied they are they are being applied

5717.6 --> 5722.56
like in little little devices

5720.88 --> 5724.400000000001
right

5722.56 --> 5726.719
like solar powered

5724.4 --> 5729.839999999999
calculators

5726.719 --> 5732.4800000000005
right that's not the typical type of

5729.84 --> 5735.4400000000005
solar cell that we see

5732.48 --> 5737.839999999999
when we see like the big squared glass

5735.44 --> 5737.839999999999
things

5738.32 --> 5741.599999999999
so there's different types of material

5740.08 --> 5743.84
and they can be applied in different

5741.6 --> 5743.84
ways

5744.32 --> 5750.08
so there's still more options for solar

5748.88 --> 5753.04
power

5750.08 --> 5755.44
generation application but it just

5753.04 --> 5757.44
should never it should never be a

5755.44 --> 5759.44
centralized thing

5757.44 --> 5762.96
because again you need to apply it

5759.44 --> 5765.36
locally like in the device on the device

5762.96 --> 5766.88
right next to the device that's gonna

5765.36 --> 5771.48
use the energy

5766.88 --> 5771.4800000000005
otherwise it's just all gonna be lost

5774.08 --> 5778.48
and that problem remains

5776.8 --> 5780.96
like that's problem's not going to be

5778.48 --> 5782.799999999999
solved by having more efficient solar

5780.96 --> 5785.679
panels it's still just going to be

5782.8 --> 5787.92
wasted if you all generate that

5785.679 --> 5789.679
power with solar panels in one region

5787.92 --> 5793.04
then have it

5789.679 --> 5796.32
have all that electricity moved

5793.04 --> 5799.84
for a lot of kilometers a lot of

5796.32 --> 5799.84
distance it's going to be wasted

5800.08 --> 5804.119
and that problem is going to remain

5818.32 --> 5823.799999999999
what

5819.28 --> 5823.8
i don't understand that question poonami

5830.239 --> 5833.759999999999
if i could

5832.159 --> 5836.638999999999
take the credit

5833.76 --> 5838.639
for something out there that isn't mine

5836.639 --> 5842.2390000000005
which piece would it why the hell would

5838.639 --> 5842.2390000000005
i even answer such question

5848.48 --> 5853.44
i'm not gonna choose anything unless i

5851.04 --> 5855.679
made it

5853.44 --> 5857.28
why the hell would i want to take it

5855.679 --> 5858.4800000000005
take the credit for something that i

5857.28 --> 5861.8
haven't made

5858.48 --> 5861.799999999999
that's ridiculous

5870.159 --> 5872.5599999999995
anyway

5872.8 --> 5881.320000000001
it seems like the subscribers only

5876.48 --> 5881.32
chat system is working out just fine

5883.119 --> 5887.04
you convert to higher voltage there's

5885.36 --> 5890.32
less loss in

5887.04 --> 5892.719
sending it a big distance

5890.32 --> 5892.719
yes

5893.119 --> 5898.08
but it isn't

5895.52 --> 5901.040000000001
gear shifted that's the problem

5898.08 --> 5901.92
they don't do that

5901.04 --> 5902.96
yeah

5901.92 --> 5904.88
yeah

5902.96 --> 5906.719
if the electrical system could be

5904.88 --> 5908.96
completely

5906.719 --> 5911.76
rearranged and just like yeah let's do

5908.96 --> 5914.639
it freaking tesla style now like stop

5911.76 --> 5914.639
screwing around

5915.119 --> 5919.839999999999
let's let's

5916.639 --> 5921.76
use electrical systems high voltage

5919.84 --> 5923.76
and we could even like

5921.76 --> 5926.639
if you go high voltage you could go to

5923.76 --> 5930.159000000001
wireless energy transfer right it would

5926.639 --> 5932.2390000000005
solve so much of energy crisis problems

5930.159 --> 5934.0
they don't do it though

5932.239 --> 5937.5599999999995
doesn't seem like they're gonna do it at

5934.0 --> 5937.56
any point either

5938.239 --> 5942.5599999999995
so

5939.52 --> 5945.679
yeah another solution would be to just

5942.56 --> 5945.679
have the electric

5946.8 --> 5953.04
device the electric generator device

5949.28 --> 5954.719
solar panel wind right next to the

5953.04 --> 5956.88
to the piece of machinery that's going

5954.719 --> 5960.28
to utilize the energy and then it's

5956.88 --> 5960.28
solved too

5971.679 --> 5974.679
do

5981.52 --> 5986.639
can't wait to hear this 18 year old

5984.0 --> 5990.44
coming to nathan what

5986.639 --> 5990.4400000000005
what are you talking about

6003.04 --> 6008.44
18 year old train wreck coming right up

6005.44 --> 6008.44
right

6015.84 --> 6021.76
it's been a good show today very happy

6018.96 --> 6024.159
it's a lot about electrics

6021.76 --> 6026.56
energy well it is a good discussion to

6024.159 --> 6029.599999999999
have right because the world is now

6026.56 --> 6032.56
thanks to stupid war [ __ ]

6029.6 --> 6035.52
which is mostly the west's fault yeah i

6032.56 --> 6037.52
i said it i blame the west

6035.52 --> 6039.76
all of it is completely unnecessary it's

6037.52 --> 6041.76
because the west wanted to keep freaking

6039.76 --> 6043.119000000001
poking the bear at the virtue signal

6041.76 --> 6045.280000000001
against a bunch of

6043.119 --> 6046.88
satanic media controllers

6045.28 --> 6049.28
[Music]

6046.88 --> 6051.28
yeah and now you got a shitty situation

6049.28 --> 6054.32
on your hands

6051.28 --> 6056.5599999999995
so yeah power

6054.32 --> 6059.36
is gonna be more

6056.56 --> 6062.639
in the minds of men

6059.36 --> 6065.44
because there's shortage and people

6062.639 --> 6067.76
will want to figure out how do i fix

6065.44 --> 6068.799999999999
this situation can i generate something

6067.76 --> 6071.679
myself

6068.8 --> 6074.56
guess what i can give you superficial

6071.679 --> 6076.96
tips on where to go

6074.56 --> 6078.96
what to do what to avoid

6076.96 --> 6081.52
right i've just done that i've just

6078.96 --> 6083.92
basically given basic

6081.52 --> 6086.96
electrical advice

6083.92 --> 6089.1990000000005
for free on our win show

6086.96 --> 6089.199
right

6089.84 --> 6092.4800000000005
i'm not

6091.679 --> 6095.52
a

6092.48 --> 6097.5199999999995
company representative

6095.52 --> 6099.84
i'm just interested

6097.52 --> 6102.4800000000005
i'm just interested i care

6099.84 --> 6103.84
in how this works i care

6102.48 --> 6106.08
in

6103.84 --> 6108.639
keeping the power going because hey i

6106.08 --> 6112.239
need it i use a computer i use the

6108.639 --> 6114.400000000001
internet i need that power to stay there

6112.239 --> 6116.959999999999
or everything that i've built is gonna

6114.4 --> 6116.96
just like

6117.199 --> 6121.48
yeah drop out of existence

6122.0 --> 6126.639
so i'm sharing this knowledge in the

6123.44 --> 6129.5199999999995
hope that people will pay attention and

6126.639 --> 6131.52
think carefully about their choices and

6129.52 --> 6134.719
like what are they gonna

6131.52 --> 6136.080000000001
set up for their business or their home

6134.719 --> 6137.28
when it comes to

6136.08 --> 6139.76
heat

6137.28 --> 6141.119
and electricity generation how are you

6139.76 --> 6143.52
going to arrange that how are you going

6141.119 --> 6146.48
to save your costs

6143.52 --> 6149.040000000001
right and there is a lot of engineering

6146.48 --> 6149.839999999999
developments in all this

6149.04 --> 6152.239
so

6149.84 --> 6154.96
definitely worth looking into

6152.239 --> 6154.959999999999
in this age

6155.04 --> 6159.199
is trying to get a deal with octopus

6156.88 --> 6159.1990000000005
energy

6160.96 --> 6165.76
that would be funny

6163.36 --> 6165.759999999999
sure

6168.639 --> 6172.56
i mean

6170.56 --> 6174.88
i wouldn't mind having them as a sponsor

6172.56 --> 6177.04
i guess but although it is an english

6174.88 --> 6178.96
company that haven't heard of that of

6177.04 --> 6180.719
them in the netherlands

6178.96 --> 6182.96
right anyway i'm gonna round out the

6180.719 --> 6182.96
show

6187.92 --> 6190.92
hmm

6191.28 --> 6196.44
the earth came in and said to redirect

6193.199 --> 6196.44
him what

6208.719 --> 6212.08
right

6209.6 --> 6214.320000000001
so thanks everyone for coming

6212.08 --> 6216.88
i hope you liked this show i thought it

6214.32 --> 6218.96
was a great show and i really liked the

6216.88 --> 6220.719
subscriber only mode

6218.96 --> 6223.44
it's definitely cutting down on the

6220.719 --> 6226.159
troll spam

6223.44 --> 6228.48
so if you like this show as well then

6226.159 --> 6230.4

weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

6238.4 --> 6243.199
weekend and please also do support me

6241.28 --> 6244.88
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

6243.199 --> 6248.0
super chat and the membership system

6244.88 --> 6250.08
join button they'll be much appreciated

6248.0 --> 6252.32
you can definitely still use the

6250.08 --> 6254.8
financial support i'm getting some but i

6252.32 --> 6257.119
i kind of i need more

6254.8 --> 6259.28
i'm sorry guys i really do i got bills

6257.119 --> 6262.159
and they're building

6259.28 --> 6263.679
there's going to be a price if i don't

6262.159 --> 6266.32
get to like

6263.679 --> 6267.679
cut some of this debt away

6266.32 --> 6269.679
it's going to cost me more it's

6267.679 --> 6272.84
basically debt inflation for me

6269.679 --> 6274.4800000000005
personally so please keep supporting

6272.84 --> 6276.32
right

6274.48 --> 6278.159
maybe you could like make a profit out

6276.32 --> 6280.5599999999995
of the energy market with what i just

6278.159 --> 6282.159
told you and then send that part of that

6280.56 --> 6283.76
profit to me and that would be greatly

6282.159 --> 6286.08
appreciated

6283.76 --> 6290.159000000001
right anyway i'll be back tomorrow with

6286.08 --> 6291.199
flat earth early bird number 1181

6290.159 --> 6292.879999999999
on a

6291.199 --> 6294.638999999999
friday and i'm going to join the flat

6292.88 --> 6297.52
earth debates which should start up any

6294.639 --> 6302.84
minute now hope to see you there in chat

6297.52 --> 6334.080000000001
and until the next video keep it flat

6302.84 --> 6334.08
[Music]

6351.76 --> 6353.84
you
