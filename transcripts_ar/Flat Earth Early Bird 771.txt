86.479 --> 89.84
so today the weather is

90.24 --> 95.759
yeah it's okay it was a lot sunnier this

93.759 --> 97.759
morning

95.759 --> 101.04
but yeah now there's currently like

97.759 --> 104.24
these clouds hanging over

101.04 --> 106.96000000000001
but it's been overall pretty nice still

104.24 --> 106.96
very cold

108.399 --> 111.84
doesn't seem to be a lot of wind ground

111.2 --> 115.28
level

111.84 --> 118.32000000000001
even though the clouds are gradually

115.28 --> 118.32000000000001
sliding over

118.399 --> 123.43900000000001
don't know if the camera can show you

121.04 --> 123.43900000000001
that but

126.84 --> 129.84
anyway

131.52 --> 133.92000000000002
right

135.2 --> 143.83999999999997
so it's friday

148.72 --> 157.28
and nobody's in chat just yet

153.599 --> 160.56
but see where it's going

157.28 --> 164.8
uh yeah i have to address

160.56 --> 164.8
yesterday i didn't watch it back really

165.04 --> 169.35999999999999
but yeah the memory of everything said

167.599 --> 172.39999999999998
was definitely there

169.36 --> 172.4
and i feel like i

172.56 --> 175.76
it's not even that i went overboard or

174.8 --> 179.36
anything

175.76 --> 184.72
or maybe because in a way i did

179.36 --> 188.48000000000002
it's just that

184.72 --> 192.319
i just really fell for the trick like

188.48 --> 194.48
the trick if it isn't is it even a trick

192.319 --> 196.319
like the whole situation with the

194.48 --> 196.879
storming of the capital and everything

196.319 --> 203.11999999999998
it's

196.879 --> 203.12
just so convoluted and i overreacted

203.2 --> 207.44
because it kind of got to me and now i

205.84 --> 210.72
feel kind of stupid for that

207.44 --> 213.68
even though yeah i'm not even entirely

210.72 --> 216.319
sure what happened

213.68 --> 216.31900000000002
completely

216.72 --> 221.35999999999999
but it kind of got to me and now i feel

218.56 --> 221.36
stupid for

221.68 --> 227.84
getting all worked up over it

228.72 --> 235.439
it's just the old program

231.84 --> 238.48
almost one could say it's just

235.439 --> 240.72
because i've been very invested in alex

238.48 --> 242.23899999999998
jones and the whole movement for a very

240.72 --> 244.959
long time

242.239 --> 245.76
very long time and it's just very hard

244.959 --> 248.879
not to

245.76 --> 254.56
step right back in there sometimes when

248.879 --> 258.56
things get intense

254.56 --> 260.479
hello by the way zack and rob h

258.56 --> 262.079
yeah rob h you've been sending me a lot

260.479 --> 266.15999999999997
of emails

262.079 --> 269.84000000000003
lately i think it was you at least

266.16 --> 269.84000000000003
or maybe not maybe it's

274.16 --> 277.36
no it is you i think

280.88 --> 284.08
oh by the way i have to shout out a

282.96 --> 297.84
paypal

284.08 --> 297.84
was it again

302.08 --> 307.039
yeah yeah cameron gilmore so thank you

305.36 --> 307.68
very much cameron gilmore for your

307.039 --> 311.52
support i

307.68 --> 314.32
really appreciate that yeah i was you

311.52 --> 317.039
yeah because sometimes this other i

314.32 --> 319.919
think another guy

317.039 --> 321.52
that's very similar named rh i'm not

319.919 --> 323.59999999999997
sure if it is

321.52 --> 325.19899999999996
it gets kind of confusing because i get

323.6 --> 329.12
like these baller

325.199 --> 330.88
messages too like somebody still threw

329.12 --> 334.72
my email trying to convince me that

330.88 --> 334.71999999999997
somehow the earth is a ball it's very

336.84 --> 342.71999999999997
confusing

338.639 --> 342.72
hello here we go again

344.639 --> 347.68
right but anyway i do appreciate the

347.039 --> 350.639
emails

347.68 --> 350.639
it is kind of nice

351.12 --> 357.6
but like that earth rotation message

354.96 --> 357.59999999999997
that was just

363.759 --> 367.36
was not entirely prepared for a message

365.919 --> 370.31899999999996
like that

367.36 --> 370.319
but anyway

374.24 --> 381.039
so yeah i've been feeling kind of

375.759 --> 383.91900000000004
conflicted yesterday

381.039 --> 385.759
because in a way i did i was just

383.919 --> 389.12
throwing out my honest feelings

385.759 --> 391.759
kind of old feelings but then as it was

389.12 --> 394.639
rolling out i was already

391.759 --> 396.16
i was more focused on okay let's let's

394.639 --> 398.479
try to prevent

396.16 --> 400.40000000000003
extra damage because like when you're in

398.479 --> 403.44
a state like that you can throw at some

400.4 --> 406.71999999999997
really stupid things

403.44 --> 410.24
and i was just trying to be

406.72 --> 413.03900000000004
angry and not incriminate myself somehow

410.24 --> 415.599
because i yeah that's completely stupid

413.039 --> 415.599
to do that

417.599 --> 422.0
somebody in the chat was even trying to

420.16 --> 424.8
pull it out of me at some point that was

422.0 --> 424.8
really annoying

426.0 --> 430.8
but even like as that was rounding out i

428.479 --> 433.199
was just feeling kind of stupid

430.8 --> 435.12
because i just fell for the trap kind of

433.199 --> 437.84000000000003
that's what it feels like and i already

435.12 --> 440.16
did it yeah as soon as i kind of stuck

437.84 --> 440.88
my toe out i just got trapped in it and

440.16 --> 444.16
then you

440.88 --> 444.15999999999997
have to roll it out

446.24 --> 452.56
and besides like yeah it was an event

450.0 --> 455.12
it was kind of an event and it probably

452.56 --> 457.599
pulled a whole lot of people in

455.12 --> 460.56
and then afterward it was like hearing

457.599 --> 463.68
alex jones about it afterward

460.56 --> 463.68
even yesterday

463.759 --> 468.47900000000004
like it was a really weird situation in

466.879 --> 471.28000000000003
many ways

468.479 --> 471.28
and i think that

475.36 --> 479.199
it was even like even alex jones had

477.52 --> 482.15999999999997
kind of trouble

479.199 --> 483.199
trying to fight or find a good angle to

482.16 --> 486.24
the situation

483.199 --> 488.96000000000004
because yeah

486.24 --> 489.36
like i wonder if he completely knows

488.96 --> 491.52
what

489.36 --> 493.12
what really went down and he's trying to

491.52 --> 495.68
figure it out maybe he did

493.12 --> 497.039
it's just either way it's become really

495.68 --> 500.08
confusing

497.039 --> 502.479
what really transpired

500.08 --> 504.8
not even like the things that

502.479 --> 507.84
specifically happened but rather how it

504.8 --> 507.84000000000003
all got there

508.4 --> 512.7189999999999
is anybody else getting this that it's

510.96 --> 515.76
just

512.719 --> 518.0
it's just this unclarity as to like how

515.76 --> 521.039
did it

518.0 --> 523.68
what really happened down there

521.039 --> 525.919
and alex has brought forth this idea

523.68 --> 525.919
that

525.92 --> 530.399
that it's all antifa that yeah somehow

528.64 --> 532.24
they

530.399 --> 533.839
came through the barriers and the police

532.24 --> 534.5600000000001
just let it happen while in other

533.839 --> 537.44
moments they

534.56 --> 537.76
obviously did not so it there seems it's

537.44 --> 541.44
just

537.76 --> 541.4399999999999
really weird how that all happened

545.6 --> 552.16
and maybe they sorta did let

548.72 --> 556.24
that happen as some kind of

552.16 --> 559.92
counter-op to try and make

556.24 --> 559.92
the trump supporters look bad

560.24 --> 568.16
it's just

563.44 --> 568.1600000000001
jb gunner came to the same conclusion

570.64 --> 573.68
right well from that perspective you

572.48 --> 576.72
know from making

573.68 --> 578.88
the other side look bad yeah me what i

576.72 --> 581.76
even called for anyway

578.88 --> 584.08
yeah that that didn't help at all and

581.76 --> 586.56
that's why i feel kind of bad

584.08 --> 588.48
about it after learning what really

586.56 --> 589.4399999999999
happened yeah it was a natural response

588.48 --> 592.32
yeah it's

589.44 --> 592.6400000000001
anchored in pretty serious situation

592.32 --> 596.08
like

592.64 --> 598.16
it like all of it is just making a

596.08 --> 600.48
mockery of the constitution all of

598.16 --> 601.519
everything that's going down how bad

600.48 --> 604.32
it's gone

601.519 --> 606.64
like it's already gone it's just that we

604.32 --> 607.279
forget sometimes i forget sometimes i

606.64 --> 610.88
just hope

607.279 --> 610.88
it's better than it really is

612.16 --> 615.68
it was planned months ago

616.839 --> 622.32
right but it was planned months ago as

619.6 --> 624.64
just a protest i think

622.32 --> 627.279
i don't know if they ever plan for it to

624.64 --> 633.8389999999999
go this far

627.279 --> 633.8389999999999
here we go again

637.43 --> 642.64
[Music]

639.6 --> 646.48
so yeah i feel conflicted and

642.64 --> 648.88
kind of have regrets

646.48 --> 650.48
but i still like i'm not going like i

648.88 --> 651.76
even felt at the moment like maybe i

650.48 --> 654.16
should take it down but that's just

651.76 --> 656.24
gonna have a stress and effect

654.16 --> 657.8389999999999
besides i think people out there aren't

656.24 --> 661.92
even gonna take it

657.839 --> 664.0790000000001
as bad as i take it

661.92 --> 667.279
because to me it just feels like i got

664.079 --> 670.88
fooled got full again

667.279 --> 673.6
but it's like an old wound now yeah

670.88 --> 676.079
not necessarily salt that is all just

673.6 --> 681.2
damage

676.079 --> 684.64
an old belief i got tricked

681.2 --> 686.48
by my own longings and i feel kind of

684.64 --> 689.519
stupid now for that

686.48 --> 691.44
but at least yeah i already knew like

689.519 --> 695.279
i'm definitely gonna address that

691.44 --> 695.2790000000001
not gonna pretend like nothing happened

698.399 --> 705.12
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

702.48 --> 706.72
it wasn't antifa just terrible back

705.12 --> 709.68
pedaling

706.72 --> 711.76
well yeah well antifa you know alex

709.68 --> 714.079
jones calls that antifa but

711.76 --> 715.68
it could simply have been police

714.079 --> 719.12
operatives

715.68 --> 719.76
in plain clothing you know alex tends to

719.12 --> 722.72
call them

719.76 --> 724.88
antifa too because well it is kind of

722.72 --> 728.32
happening a lot a lot of

724.88 --> 730.639
kids are like family in the with police

728.32 --> 731.6800000000001
like it's so many so much convoluted

730.639 --> 734.639
[ __ ] going on

731.68 --> 736.7199999999999
so he just kind of synchronized and then

734.639 --> 738.72
calls them antifa but

736.72 --> 740.9590000000001
there is a likelihood that there were

738.72 --> 740.9590000000001
just

741.36 --> 745.839
police in trump outfits

746.16 --> 752.3199999999999
like yeah sort of pushing

749.2 --> 753.76
that making that happen there was

752.32 --> 756.24
and there were some people that were

753.76 --> 758.56
just like vandalizing too

756.24 --> 760.48
and that's really completely out of

758.56 --> 762.56
character

760.48 --> 764.72
there's no reason and the way it

762.56 --> 767.92
happened too it's just completely that's

764.72 --> 770.88
antifa style it's not something that

767.92 --> 772.639
general trump supporters would ever do

770.88 --> 776.48
because i seen that footage

772.639 --> 779.12
just smashing windows and [ __ ]

776.48 --> 782.8000000000001
that that was antifa style there's no

779.12 --> 786.8
trumper would ever do that

782.8 --> 789.5999999999999
so i do get the suspicion like that

786.8 --> 791.1999999999999
it's not just terrible terrible back

789.6 --> 794.9590000000001
pedaling

791.2 --> 801.839
back paddling by who exactly

794.959 --> 801.8389999999999
just can you be more specific

815.12 --> 832.0
what are you talking about

829.44 --> 833.6800000000001
i know that it seems like alex was kind

832.0 --> 837.44
of backpaddling

833.68 --> 837.92
it's just that i don't know what he was

837.44 --> 840.0790000000001
doing

837.92 --> 841.92
really i don't know what the entire

840.079 --> 843.92
thing was what they were really having

841.92 --> 846.959
in mind

843.92 --> 846.959
what was gonna happen

849.44 --> 856.8800000000001
right yeah yeah yeah trump definitely

853.44 --> 859.839
backpedaled there and just

856.88 --> 862.16
and the whole thing with pants terrible

859.839 --> 864.399
situation

862.16 --> 866.7199999999999
so i guess that the momentum was kind of

864.399 --> 869.279
dispelled like this

866.72 --> 870.1600000000001
or something it's just a really

869.279 --> 874.639
confusing

870.16 --> 878.7199999999999
mess i bet that a lot of people

874.639 --> 885.36
feel like it all turned in a way that

878.72 --> 887.44
was unexpected

885.36 --> 890.0790000000001
no i'm not part of the trump support

887.44 --> 890.0790000000001
email list

892.88 --> 900.24
hard aggressive propaganda really

896.959 --> 900.2399999999999
do you have some proof of that

900.399 --> 903.44
i don't know what email list you were a

902.48 --> 913.839
part of but

903.44 --> 913.839
are you sure that's the real thing

916.06 --> 919.17
[Music]

932.959 --> 935.92
hello samson

939.04 --> 943.92
okay how do you fight me but

947.199 --> 949.7589999999999
i don't know

951.519 --> 955.92
email list so are you saying that just

955.199 --> 958.079
people

955.92 --> 960.24
in the email list were just emailing all

958.079 --> 961.519
in all directions and some people got

960.24 --> 965.759
really pissed off

961.519 --> 969.839
and aggressive because to say that the

965.759 --> 969.839
the organizing factors

970.399 --> 976.079
we're planning aggression that's

973.759 --> 976.88
that seems just that seems like a setup

976.079 --> 981.3599999999999
that seems

976.88 --> 983.92
not real so

981.36 --> 986.48
yeah would be nice if you were more

983.92 --> 986.4799999999999
specific

991.92 --> 997.8389999999999
hey rojay good to see you

999.279 --> 1002.959
oh right well the fear-mongering about

1001.36 --> 1007.04
communism

1002.959 --> 1008.3199999999999
right well it is a real situation it's

1007.04 --> 1011.8389999999999
just that

1008.32 --> 1011.839
they're kind of a part of it

1014.24 --> 1017.199
you could say that

1018.639 --> 1025.6
like the liberals the democrats

1022.56 --> 1027.76
are open overt communist

1025.6 --> 1031.039
and the trump administration are kind of

1027.76 --> 1031.039
communist in denial

1032.0 --> 1034.48
like that

1035.36 --> 1042.1599999999999
but yeah that fear-mongering that's

1038.799 --> 1043.839
there is a point to it but just because

1042.16 --> 1046.24
of the fear-mongering doesn't

1043.839 --> 1047.6789999999999
mean that they're go that that is the

1046.24 --> 1053.84
same as inciting

1047.679 --> 1053.8400000000001
violence or anything

1056.72 --> 1067.3600000000001
it's just inciting waking up

1060.16 --> 1069.28
and taking it serious like

1067.36 --> 1071.1999999999998
like inciting violence is inciting

1069.28 --> 1072.96
violence when you get specific like do

1071.2 --> 1077.28
this do that

1072.96 --> 1079.679
specifically something i tried to avoid

1077.28 --> 1082.96
yesterday

1079.679 --> 1084.72
to get yeah to stay far away from being

1082.96 --> 1087.919
specific with that sort of

1084.72 --> 1090.1000000000001
like yeah

1087.919 --> 1091.76
calling for action

1090.1 --> 1093.4399999999998
[Music]

1091.76 --> 1096.799
and i should have because i went way too

1093.44 --> 1096.799
far with that

1100.48 --> 1107.679
read between the lines okay well if your

1104.76 --> 1109.039
incrimination comes from in between the

1107.679 --> 1115.2
lines

1109.039 --> 1115.2
then it seems yeah that seems extremely

1120.84 --> 1125.039
unreliable

1122.16 --> 1126.48
zach and zach gets it it is all

1125.039 --> 1137.84
contrived

1126.48 --> 1137.84
it's just a giant mess now

1161.12 --> 1167.4399999999998
14 year old vet what

1164.48 --> 1167.44
are you talking about

1176.84 --> 1179.84
what

1187.36 --> 1193.84
right here we go again yeah well that's

1189.12 --> 1193.84
what i feel about it too

1209.44 --> 1216.88
right okay audio fight me well

1213.76 --> 1217.84
then yeah what the the entire angle you

1216.88 --> 1221.1200000000001
brought to it

1217.84 --> 1222.0
is just wrong then because as i thought

1221.12 --> 1225.28
it's just

1222.0 --> 1228.32
people squirting basically getting

1225.28 --> 1230.559
overly worked out like

1228.32 --> 1232.6399999999999
worked up about it kind of like i was

1230.559 --> 1234.559
yesterday that doesn't mean that they

1232.64 --> 1237.8400000000001
literally were

1234.559 --> 1249.84
planning extremities that's just people

1237.84 --> 1249.84
getting worked up

1272.96 --> 1277.8400000000001
h that still doesn't make any damn sense

1278.48 --> 1284.96
a babbitt a 14 year old vet

1281.52 --> 1288.0
what okay a person

1284.96 --> 1290.4
you mean the woman that got shot right

1288.0 --> 1291.84
and there were other yes choked on tear

1290.4 --> 1293.2800000000002
gas

1291.84 --> 1305.84
somebody got a heart attack yeah we

1293.28 --> 1305.84
didn't see that

1323.84 --> 1327.1999999999998
wow so you guys really think that it was

1326.799 --> 1331.9189999999999
all

1327.2 --> 1334.24
like the inside was all a crisis act

1331.919 --> 1336.7990000000002
that's just nutty

1334.24 --> 1338.48
who knows man i can't tell i really

1336.799 --> 1347.84
can't

1338.48 --> 1347.84
but i i don't think so just

1367.28 --> 1374.08
wow okay so you think it was all like a

1371.28 --> 1374.8799999999999
controlled obstacle course like

1374.08 --> 1379.52
situation

1374.88 --> 1383.2800000000002
a fake micro revolution

1379.52 --> 1383.28
that the people were not aware of

1384.48 --> 1388.96
because it did feel a little bit like

1386.32 --> 1391.2
that like it was some kind of a

1388.96 --> 1392.64
squirt revolution sounds very harsh like

1391.2 --> 1394.72
that because to the people

1392.64 --> 1397.44
that were part of it it probably wasn't

1394.72 --> 1397.44
like that at all

1399.12 --> 1406.0
but that trump maybe sort of

1402.48 --> 1409.28
wanted to give them the feel for that

1406.0 --> 1409.919
for taking it back but wasn't able to

1409.28 --> 1417.84
actually

1409.919 --> 1417.8400000000001
secure it and actually achieve that

1430.559 --> 1437.12
so he just yeah executed a

1434.24 --> 1437.84
a larp scenario yeah although people did

1437.12 --> 1439.52
get

1437.84 --> 1442.08
killed i think that woman didn't get

1439.52 --> 1445.84
killed and the other three i don't know

1442.08 --> 1445.84
haven't seen anything about it but sure

1446.4 --> 1462.0
so yeah that it's just crazy

1458.72 --> 1464.4
so so you guys think i guess

1462.0 --> 1465.76
i'm not even sure any point anymore what

1464.4 --> 1467.44
you guys think i'm just

1465.76 --> 1470.48
throwing out ideas there i don't

1467.44 --> 1475.1200000000001
necessarily support it i think it's all

1470.48 --> 1475.1200000000001
very confusing you guys are saying that

1475.84 --> 1482.8799999999999
basically trump himself

1478.88 --> 1482.88
stopped the revolution from happening

1483.919 --> 1488.4
well from a political angle that kind of

1487.12 --> 1491.9189999999999
makes sense because

1488.4 --> 1495.44
i very much believe that trump

1491.919 --> 1499.679
is part of the deep state

1495.44 --> 1503.1200000000001
he's just he wants to be another faction

1499.679 --> 1507.52
like with another way of executing

1503.12 --> 1510.4799999999998
the agenda so he's like a

1507.52 --> 1512.8799999999999
deep state competitor not somebody who's

1510.48 --> 1514.799
trying to get rid of it

1512.88 --> 1516.5590000000002
i've been having that feeling for a long

1514.799 --> 1519.039
time and it's even been sort of

1516.559 --> 1521.2
like when things were really good it was

1519.039 --> 1522.48
kind of hinted at like yeah he's just

1521.2 --> 1528.96
gonna take it over

1522.48 --> 1533.679
and things will be much better so

1528.96 --> 1533.679
yeah super convoluted like that

1535.12 --> 1543.84
damn it youtube stop freaking stalling

1537.6 --> 1543.84
my video this is super annoying

1551.2 --> 1557.8400000000001
he is owned

1575.52 --> 1584.4
by who how

1580.159 --> 1587.5200000000002
like i don't i don't see it like that

1584.4 --> 1590.159
he's just he's

1587.52 --> 1592.799
into everything he's into all the groups

1590.159 --> 1594.72
he's a businessman like that

1592.799 --> 1596.72
they have dirt on trump well they're not

1594.72 --> 1598.32
revealing it

1596.72 --> 1601.1200000000001
so if they're not revealing it that

1598.32 --> 1603.84
means that he is

1601.12 --> 1604.7199999999998
part of it so i don't think so i really

1603.84 --> 1609.1999999999998
don't

1604.72 --> 1609.2
here we go again at this point

1609.76 --> 1613.919
if there was actually any dirt on him

1611.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
then it would have been

1613.919 --> 1627.8400000000001
all over the place

1637.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
can't revealing it because

1642.399 --> 1646.6599999999999

1653.12 --> 1659.4399999999998
helpful at all

1654.08 --> 1661.6
[Music]

1659.44 --> 1663.52
that makes it just a giant terrible

1661.6 --> 1666.799
situation

1663.52 --> 1667.76
that's just unredeemable and terrible

1666.799 --> 1671.279
and

1667.76 --> 1671.279
it can only get worse so

1677.44 --> 1681.2
they could ruin him if they wanted to

1679.76 --> 1684.559
it's already rude

1681.2 --> 1686.64
dude seriously

1684.559 --> 1689.039
you think trump is going to have any

1686.64 --> 1691.679
kind of normal life

1689.039 --> 1696.72
after he becomes president in any sort

1691.679 --> 1699.039
of way

1696.72 --> 1700.799
after everything that's happened really

1699.039 --> 1711.84
you think that

1700.799 --> 1711.84
no not at all

1714.399 --> 1718.399
his business is family oh yeah and how

1716.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
how great is that doing

1718.399 --> 1725.84
you heard anything about his business

1750.84 --> 1753.84
um

1757.679 --> 1762.159
right i heard that too samson pretty

1760.08 --> 1766.72
ridiculous

1762.159 --> 1769.279
so yeah where is this going along

1766.72 --> 1771.6000000000001
to not get targeted and to get out of it

1769.279 --> 1773.12
all right here we go again

1771.6 --> 1776.0
how do you think he's gonna get out of

1773.12 --> 1778.32
this let's get realistic here

1776.0 --> 1781.84
let's not ignore everything that's been

1778.32 --> 1781.84
going down in the last four years

1785.44 --> 1809.8400000000001
oh now it's his ego was exploited sure

1795.84 --> 1809.84
that's all really

1810.64 --> 1815.1200000000001
so if you were in his position how how

1812.88 --> 1823.8400000000001
do you think you would get out of that

1815.12 --> 1823.84
ever after everything that's happened

1828.08 --> 1831.12
i don't know who that is

1834.48 --> 1850.63
really you think he's going to just flee

1836.559 --> 1854.279

i've learned a lot about it but yeah i

1922.72 --> 1925.44
am getting tricked again every now and

1924.48 --> 1928.48
then

1925.44 --> 1931.679
and i'm just getting really

1928.48 --> 1931.679
really pissed off

1933.2 --> 1949.8400000000001
about it because

1936.399 --> 1949.84
it's just all [ __ ] all of it

1956.24 --> 1962.799
all these people with all their gun

1959.76 --> 1963.44
piles and all their food are just going

1962.799 --> 1965.9189999999999
to be

1963.44 --> 1968.159
stuck there until everything is all

1965.919 --> 1970.72
choked to death

1968.159 --> 1971.2
so that's that's going to be the united

1970.72 --> 1974.24
states

1971.2 --> 1979.2
like it is communist and it's so

1974.24 --> 1979.2
it there is no turning back it's over

1980.96 --> 1986.3990000000001
what probably was over from the start

1984.48 --> 1987.6
we just were tricked into believing it

1986.399 --> 1992.559
wasn't over

1987.6 --> 1992.559
but it is over it's all [ __ ] all of

2002.84 --> 2007.84
it

2005.44 --> 2009.679
yeah and with the the rest of the world

2007.84 --> 2013.4399999999998
too it's over

2009.679 --> 2016.0800000000002
it's just over there is no more freedom

2013.44 --> 2017.2
it doesn't exist anymore we lost

2016.08 --> 2020.0
everything is lost

2017.2 --> 2021.76
this is all just letting us squirt out

2020.0 --> 2024.0
our blabbering opinions

2021.76 --> 2026.399
until we all get tired out and realized

2024.0 --> 2029.679
we lost and there's nothing left

2026.399 --> 2032.08
i think that's the strategy now

2029.679 --> 2035.039
just let her give us our opinions don't

2032.08 --> 2037.4399999999998
attack it they'll just encourage us more

2035.039 --> 2038.559
just let us blabber on and squirt all

2037.44 --> 2040.24
over the place

2038.559 --> 2042.08
until we're done until we're all

2040.24 --> 2044.64
exhausted

2042.08 --> 2047.12
done with it don't want to associate in

2044.64 --> 2050.56
any form any longer ever again

2047.12 --> 2054.0789999999997

2050.56 --> 2057.0
piece by piece let it all happen until

2054.079 --> 2059.599
everybody is so miserable and

2057.0 --> 2061.76
deteriorated physically

2061.76 --> 2066.0
systematically kill themselves

2066.0 --> 2070.879

i should have just punched myself in the

2131.76 --> 2135.92
[ __ ]

2133.359 --> 2138.0789999999997
and even flat earth all of this it can

just happen because it doesn't matter

2138.079 --> 2142.5600000000004
anymore

2140.48 --> 2145.04
just let the people that have any kind

2142.56 --> 2145.839
of sensibility left just squirt it all

2145.04 --> 2148.32
out

2145.839 --> 2150.72
notice how it doesn't matter people that

are delusional will stay delusional will

2150.72 --> 2153.839
grow

worse in their delusion they will attain

power

2154.4 --> 2158.079
through their delusion hand it down to

2156.88 --> 2161.119
them

2158.079 --> 2163.04
until it's all gone and there's only

2161.119 --> 2165.2000000000003
those nasty people left because the

2163.04 --> 2166.64
newer generations aren't going to do any

2165.2 --> 2169.2
of it

2166.64 --> 2170.24
they know it per default and they will

2169.2 --> 2172.48
just let it all

die everything and everyone they won't

2172.48 --> 2176.0
give a [ __ ]

that are just there putting us in an

inescapable bubble

2186.079 --> 2189.6800000000003
where everything can just consume itself

2188.4 --> 2201.839
until it's all gone

2189.68 --> 2201.839
and dead

2205.76 --> 2211.599
you can't give up on what

on just squirting the truth the rest of

2211.599 --> 2216.56
your life well literally

2213.28 --> 2219.599
nothing happens with it because there is

no way out it's literally

2219.599 --> 2223.6800000000003
allowed because it doesn't matter

2222.079 --> 2226.7200000000003
anymore

2223.68 --> 2228.3199999999997
the system's just gonna wait until these

2226.72 --> 2230.9599999999996
generations die

2228.32 --> 2231.599
and there's nobody left with a spirit to

2230.96 --> 2234.4
share it with

2231.599 --> 2236.079
everybody that's what they're waiting

2234.4 --> 2238.2400000000002
for they're waiting us

2236.079 --> 2239.599
for the last generations that had any

2238.24 --> 2244.16
kind of hope left

2239.599 --> 2246.1600000000003
to die so that the next generations

2244.16 --> 2247.839
won't have anything to replace it with

2246.16 --> 2250.72
because they

2247.839 --> 2252.0789999999997
inescapably know there is no more hope

2250.72 --> 2255.04
of escaping

2252.079 --> 2257.3590000000004
so they want they won't attain that

2255.04 --> 2259.359
spirit they don't want to anymore

2257.359 --> 2262.64
because they know it's completely

2259.359 --> 2262.64
[ __ ] useless

2263.839 --> 2268.72
it's all gonna die the spirit is going

2266.0 --> 2271.839
to die people

2268.72 --> 2275.1189999999997
no more spirit in your children

2271.839 --> 2277.119
at some point very young very young

2275.119 --> 2279.359
you don't even you're going to try to

2277.119 --> 2279.6800000000003
keep your kids stupid to prevent them

2279.359 --> 2282.88
from

2279.68 --> 2283.1189999999997
realizing this [ __ ] at some point you're

2282.88 --> 2285.44
go

2283.119 --> 2287.2000000000003
you're going to actually lie to your own

2285.44 --> 2290.2400000000002
children the newer generations

2287.2 --> 2292.96
to prevent them from realizing this [ __ ]

2290.24 --> 2295.1189999999997
because when they do it's all going down

2292.96 --> 2298.2400000000002
the drain all of it

2295.119 --> 2299.44
because there is no more reason to keep

2298.24 --> 2302.72
on doing that

2299.44 --> 2306.8
because nothing is going to change

2302.72 --> 2308.3999999999996
nothing only you only yourself is going

2306.8 --> 2312.48
to change

2308.4 --> 2313.839
so are you gonna keep on summoning all

2312.48 --> 2315.76
that energy

2313.839 --> 2317.7599999999998
that comes from the the feelings the

2315.76 --> 2319.92
necessity of a change

2317.76 --> 2321.44
when it's never going to happen or

2319.92 --> 2323.44
you're just going to go along to get

2321.44 --> 2326.16
along like everybody else and just

2323.44 --> 2326.88
put on the mask and take the vaccine and

2326.16 --> 2330.0
[ __ ]

2326.88 --> 2332.56
die because there is no

other way out there is nothing gonna

2332.56 --> 2336.0
change it

2333.2 --> 2337.839
it's only gonna get worse the world is a

giant death camp

2337.839 --> 2341.2
the entire thing it's all a giant death

2340.56 --> 2343.599
camp

2341.2 --> 2346.96
just waiting the last of the spirited

people to fade away and die

2346.96 --> 2350.56
so that there is no more example of fake

hope

2350.56 --> 2356.7999999999997
false hope that the kind of corral

2354.079 --> 2357.8390000000004
people to get out of it because there is

2356.8 --> 2360.96
no way out of it

2357.839 --> 2364.64
it's just those nasty [ __ ]

2360.96 --> 2366.88
competing on how nasty they can be

2364.64 --> 2367.7599999999998
and nothing to stop them because nobody

2366.88 --> 2370.8
gives a [ __ ]

anymore nobody actually wants to give up

2370.8 --> 2374.32
their life to change anything

2374.56 --> 2377.68
and that's the only thing that's gonna

2376.0 --> 2379.76
do anything it's just

2377.68 --> 2381.44
a lot of dead people it's the only thing

2379.76 --> 2383.2000000000003
that's gonna change anything and nobody

2381.44 --> 2387.359
wants to do it

2383.2 --> 2391.2799999999997
because yeah

2387.359 --> 2393.68
the [ __ ] fake slavery life

2391.28 --> 2395.92
is too gratifying i guess it's too

2393.68 --> 2398.3999999999996
gratifying to be a hopeless [ __ ]

2395.92 --> 2401.359
zombie

2398.4 --> 2402.32
it's too gratifying you're too afraid it

2401.359 --> 2404.0789999999997
doesn't yeah

2402.32 --> 2406.319
it's only people that are actually

2404.079 --> 2408.48
gratified

2406.319 --> 2411.119
that have a life and a family and

2408.48 --> 2413.92
everything worth defending

2411.119 --> 2414.319
that might actually muster the courage

2413.92 --> 2416.64
to

2414.319 --> 2417.52
really do something to really risk

2416.64 --> 2421.1189999999997
something

2417.52 --> 2421.119
somebody that doesn't have that

2422.72 --> 2425.839
it's like when you have nothing left to

2424.88 --> 2429.359
lose

2425.839 --> 2431.2
then it doesn't mean anything anymore

2429.359 --> 2433.359
if you don't have anything to defend

2431.2 --> 2434.7999999999997
that's real then it doesn't mean

2433.359 --> 2438.2999999999997
anything

2434.8 --> 2441.4190000000003

dipping into all of this [ __ ]

2457.839 --> 2462.0
they're just ignoring everything i think

2459.92 --> 2462.319
that's the only way left to be any kind

2462.0 --> 2464.16
of

2462.319 --> 2466.64
yeah to attain some kind of happiness it

2464.16 --> 2468.48
is really like the owen benjamin way

2466.64 --> 2471.04
although he does dip into it and then

2468.48 --> 2473.04
tries to extract comedy from it

2471.04 --> 2474.24
i guess that's the only effective way to

2473.04 --> 2477.2
do anything with it

2474.24 --> 2479.7599999999998
because the rest is all gone i'm not

suited for that

it's just going to be the new nazis

2838.56 --> 2843.7599999999998
that's how the media will then

2840.64 --> 2844.0789999999997
portray it there's no escape either you

2843.76 --> 2846.7200000000003
are

2844.079 --> 2848.7200000000003
murderous nazis and everybody in the

2846.72 --> 2851.1189999999997
world is going to be made to hate you

2848.72 --> 2853.7599999999998
all the new generations will fear you

2851.119 --> 2856.8
nobody's ever going to trust you again

2853.76 --> 2859.28
if they haven't already right

2856.8 --> 2862.2400000000002
or you're all going to be slowly

2859.28 --> 2864.96
tortured to death and exterminated

2862.24 --> 2867.2
slowly tortured to death mentally and

2864.96 --> 2870.4
physically exterminated

2867.2 --> 2872.96
right so that's the option they have

2870.4 --> 2874.7200000000003
and in a way it's the option we all have

2872.96 --> 2877.28
they're just being put

2874.72 --> 2878.7999999999997
on the slaughter block right now and

2877.28 --> 2880.96
after they're done

2878.8 --> 2882.88
yeah everybody else is going to be next

2880.96 --> 2884.079
i'm probably going to be next my country

2882.88 --> 2887.44
is already so

2884.079 --> 2889.28
[ __ ] and they're not just gonna leave

2887.44 --> 2891.2000000000003
it like that

2889.28 --> 2892.48
when america is done they're literally

2891.2 --> 2895.04
gonna do the same

2892.48 --> 2896.4
level of [ __ ] even to the defenseless

2895.04 --> 2897.92
countries

2896.4 --> 2899.599
to the countries that have already

2897.92 --> 2902.48
surrendered that have already cocked

2899.599 --> 2905.119
that have already let all their children

2902.48 --> 2907.68
cut their dicks off this [ __ ] they're

2905.119 --> 2908.559
still going to [ __ ] exterminate you

2907.68 --> 2911.2799999999997
anyway

2908.559 --> 2912.3190000000004
they don't care how badly you [ __ ] and

2911.28 --> 2929.8390000000004
[ __ ] yourself

2912.319 --> 2929.839
they're going to kill you anyway

2941.04 --> 2947.2
understand that you may be

2944.88 --> 2948.4
getting used to cocking just to get

2947.2 --> 2949.5989999999997
around

2948.4 --> 2951.76
because it gives you slight

2949.599 --> 2953.52
opportunities here and there it's all

2951.76 --> 2956.8
going to end up with you

2953.52 --> 2960.16
getting exterminated

2956.8 --> 2963.3590000000004
in a way where you can't escape it

2960.16 --> 2965.839
everything you've ever done

2963.359 --> 2966.48
badly will be used against you it's

2965.839 --> 2970.0
going to be

2966.48 --> 2973.28
very torturous mentally

2970.0 --> 2974.96
mostly because yeah

2973.28 --> 2977.119
just because you cocked to get around

2974.96 --> 2981.28
doesn't mean that

2977.119 --> 2981.28
that you're going to be spared in the

2982.839 --> 2985.839
contrary

2992.24 --> 2995.7599999999998
yeah your astronaut dream it's all a

2994.559 --> 2998.0400000000004
[ __ ] dream

2995.76 --> 3000.8
for you to stare at as you're being

2998.04 --> 3002.96
exterminated

3000.8 --> 3005.119
that's your astronaut dream that's your

3002.96 --> 3007.8
[ __ ] nasa space dream

3005.119 --> 3009.52
oh more opportunity while you're being

3007.8 --> 3011.76
exterminated

3009.52 --> 3013.04
it's the dream to stare at as you're

3011.76 --> 3016.1600000000003
being tortured to

3013.04 --> 3027.839
death is it really worth it is that

3016.16 --> 3027.839
really worth it

3033.52 --> 3038.64
yeah now those globers are in the matrix

3036.72 --> 3040.8799999999997
it is a literal matrix they're literally

3038.64 --> 3042.7999999999997
just being used as

3040.88 --> 3044.0
batteries or whatever you want to see it

3042.8 --> 3046.8
it's

3044.0 --> 3048.72
just being used as parts of a machine

3046.8 --> 3051.28
and they have no control over it and

3048.72 --> 3052.48
the only consolidation the price they

3051.28 --> 3056.0
ever had

3052.48 --> 3057.599
it's a stupid ball belief how pathetic

3056.0 --> 3060.24
is that

3057.599 --> 3062.0
peer pressure based on ball belief and

3060.24 --> 3065.7599999999998
trickery [ __ ]

3062.0 --> 3067.92
fake intellectualism so you can feel

3065.76 --> 3068.3190000000004
very good about yourself in the face of

3067.92 --> 3070.96
even

3068.319 --> 3073.599
dumber people than you or easily peer

3070.96 --> 3083.839
pressured people yeah

3073.599 --> 3083.839
brilliant brilliant tactic

3111.119 --> 3117.359
yeah now what makes the ball successful

3114.24 --> 3121.359
is the willingness to

3117.359 --> 3124.319
utilize lies and fake dreams

3121.359 --> 3125.359
for virtual social peer pressure based

3124.319 --> 3128.0
authority

3125.359 --> 3129.44
and you're willing to abuse that lie

3128.0 --> 3131.359
system to get ahead

3129.44 --> 3134.0
that's what it's proving it's just proof

3131.359 --> 3135.7599999999998
you're a scumbag that deserves

3134.0 --> 3137.44
everything that they are getting and

3135.76 --> 3138.7200000000003
that's what they want they want

3137.44 --> 3141.839
everybody

3138.72 --> 3144.8799999999997
to just convolute and shame themselves

3141.839 --> 3148.5589999999997
so badly horrifically

3144.88 --> 3151.04
so that yeah as it's all going down as

3148.559 --> 3151.76
everybody's being slowly exterminated at

3151.04 --> 3155.04
least you

3151.76 --> 3158.0
deserved it yeah

3155.04 --> 3159.7599999999998
that's what they want that's what they

3158.0 --> 3162.88
want

3159.76 --> 3163.28
they want you to deserve it they want

3162.88 --> 3167.04
you

3163.28 --> 3170.7200000000003
to deserve what they're giving you

3167.04 --> 3172.5589999999997
you understand globers that's what

3170.72 --> 3174.72
the controllers the programmers the

3172.559 --> 3175.3590000000004
people that roll out the programs that

3174.72 --> 3178.64
planet

3175.359 --> 3182.16
that's what they want they want you

3178.64 --> 3186.4
to [ __ ] up your life so you deserve

3182.16 --> 3186.3999999999996
what they're gonna do to you you

3192.839 --> 3195.839
understand

3209.68 --> 3214.0
yeah a seeking star war

3223.839 --> 3228.4
yeah now look even this idea of flat

3226.88 --> 3230.88
earth like

3228.4 --> 3232.96
oh god because i'm doing flat earth that

3230.88 --> 3234.4
is causing all the problems

3232.96 --> 3236.2400000000002
right that's what the ballers think

3234.4 --> 3237.6800000000003
that's what they were trying to put in

3236.24 --> 3241.04
the chat there

3237.68 --> 3242.319
it's all [ __ ] because before i got

3241.04 --> 3245.04
into flat earth you know

3242.319 --> 3246.96
what was the situation i couldn't

3245.04 --> 3249.599
communicate with a lot of people

3246.96 --> 3250.0
i had a lot of trouble connecting or

3249.599 --> 3252.559
finding

3250.0 --> 3253.119
some kind of composure like how do i

3252.559 --> 3256.559
present

3253.119 --> 3259.04
myself when i i'm trying to meet

3256.559 --> 3261.3590000000004
somebody

3259.04 --> 3262.24
because when i meet somebody new all my

3261.359 --> 3265.2
psionics

3262.24 --> 3267.2
set in and i get completely overwhelmed

3265.2 --> 3269.9199999999996
by what i pick up on the person

3267.2 --> 3271.2799999999997
and it literally tends to mute me yeah

3269.92 --> 3274.8
yeah

3271.28 --> 3278.0
that happened before flat earth

3274.8 --> 3281.2000000000003
you get it when

3278.0 --> 3282.96
i meet somebody flat earth is not on my

3281.2 --> 3285.4399999999996
mind it's not the first thing i'm going

3282.96 --> 3289.119
to mention on my freaking list

3285.44 --> 3290.319
it never is it's kind of the last thing

3289.119 --> 3293.599
i want to bring up

3290.319 --> 3295.52
unless i think that the person might

3293.599 --> 3298.48
actually appreciate it and i'll

3295.52 --> 3299.68
derive that from hopefully starting up

3298.48 --> 3303.359
communication

3299.68 --> 3305.04
and even better if they feel

3303.359 --> 3307.359
comfortable enough to naturally

3305.04 --> 3309.52
communicate with me

3307.359 --> 3311.2799999999997
that's even better and then eventually i

3309.52 --> 3314.559
might bring it up

3311.28 --> 3315.52
right so yeah flat earth was never the

3314.559 --> 3317.76
issue

3315.52 --> 3320.64
was never the cause of suddenly no

3317.76 --> 3323.599
longer being social no longer

3320.64 --> 3324.319
knowing how to communicate with people

3323.599 --> 3327.2000000000003
that

3324.319 --> 3327.52
no the only time that became a problem

3327.2 --> 3330.0789999999997
is

3327.52 --> 3330.559
when i woke up to flat earth in that

3330.079 --> 3332.48
moment

3330.559 --> 3334.799
and realizing i was surrounded by

3332.48 --> 3337.839
ballers that were never going to change

3334.799 --> 3337.839
that was the moment

3338.319 --> 3343.2
it was never the cause of suddenly no

3341.28 --> 3344.0
longer being able to communicate with

3343.2 --> 3345.5989999999997
people

3344.0 --> 3347.599
because i've always had that sort of

3345.599 --> 3352.0
problem always been

3347.599 --> 3352.0
i guess it's classified as very shy

3354.16 --> 3358.48
i've always had that problem always my

3357.28 --> 3363.44
entire life it's

3358.48 --> 3365.28
part of what i am

3363.44 --> 3367.359
i've even learned at times to kind of

3365.28 --> 3370.799
play into it to just

3367.359 --> 3373.359
like give up in the sense like yeah i am

3370.799 --> 3376.16
shy i'm not gonna try to

3373.359 --> 3377.7599999999998
be anything else than i am and that even

3376.16 --> 3378.799
worked at times there are people that

3377.76 --> 3381.44
get that

3378.799 --> 3383.04
that don't mind people that are shy at

3381.44 --> 3386.0
first

3383.04 --> 3388.0
or even better that look at me and

3386.0 --> 3390.48
recognize that i have a lot of

3388.0 --> 3392.64
intellectual things

3390.48 --> 3394.2400000000002
but i also have the shyness so i still

3392.64 --> 3398.0789999999997
have to get over that

3394.24 --> 3400.24
first and that'll accept it

3398.079 --> 3401.76
i'm talking to face-to-face situations

3400.24 --> 3404.72
not people that

3401.76 --> 3407.2000000000003
meet me here on the internet and just

3404.72 --> 3409.359
see me openly talking completely like

3407.2 --> 3411.5989999999997
because the way that i'm talking to this

3409.359 --> 3413.52
show to you guys in chat

3411.599 --> 3415.76
to everybody else is watching out that's

3413.52 --> 3416.4
not how i normally communicate face to

3415.76 --> 3420.079
face

3416.4 --> 3423.04
just for the record and people that even

3420.079 --> 3423.44
have talked to me face to face or just

3423.04 --> 3428.4
over

3423.44 --> 3428.4
chat not on record know

3429.52 --> 3437.7599999999998
that i'm not that forward normally i'm

3433.92 --> 3437.76
also forward here because

3438.799 --> 3442.319
because i need to communicate these

3440.48 --> 3443.119
things that's part of what i do in the

3442.319 --> 3448.4
show

3443.119 --> 3448.4
i'm being extremely open

3448.799 --> 3453.04
because otherwise what would i talk

3450.72 --> 3453.04
about

3454.079 --> 3458.559
it's kind of what i came to do here to

3456.48 --> 3462.319
show

3458.559 --> 3465.599
everything that's real to lay myself

3462.319 --> 3467.119
out as a case study how just inner

3465.599 --> 3469.76
feelings and

3467.119 --> 3473.119
with an intellectual person because i am

3469.76 --> 3475.119
yeah yeah i know i am

3473.119 --> 3476.319
does it make me the smartest person in

3475.119 --> 3478.48
the world does

3476.319 --> 3481.2
definitely not make me the wisest person

3478.48 --> 3484.559
in the world in many categories

3481.2 --> 3484.5589999999997
but i am an intellect

3486.16 --> 3493.04
and yeah having it also

3490.4 --> 3495.599
doesn't mean that you're like even at an

3493.04 --> 3498.799
advantage over everybody

3495.599 --> 3499.04
because not having an intellect is also

3498.799 --> 3501.599
an

3499.04 --> 3503.44
advantage at times because it just makes

3501.599 --> 3506.6400000000003
things easier

3503.44 --> 3507.92
and you're not as hurt when you when you

3506.64 --> 3509.839
made a mistake

3507.92 --> 3512.0
because you know well i'm not that smart

3509.839 --> 3516.88
anyway so it's not that big a deal

3512.0 --> 3519.839
you see so

3516.88 --> 3519.839
yeah every time

3520.079 --> 3532.559
every time all that nonsense

3530.24 --> 3534.8799999999997
yeah compare i i don't know where i was

3532.559 --> 3534.88
going

3540.64 --> 3545.839
but i've just been bumping into that

3542.319 --> 3545.839
issue is that

3546.799 --> 3553.2
i think that my current problem of

3551.119 --> 3555.119
because i already laid it out my current

3553.2 --> 3556.839
communication problem is like how do i

3555.119 --> 3558.799
approach somebody how do i talk with

3556.839 --> 3562.24
somebody

3558.799 --> 3564.72
i just don't meet enough people

3562.24 --> 3565.359
if i bump into more people more other

3564.72 --> 3568.799
people

3565.359 --> 3570.0
then i will definitely end up opening

3568.799 --> 3572.64
communication

3570.0 --> 3573.04
it's because i don't go out enough i

3572.64 --> 3576.16
don't

3573.04 --> 3578.24
meet enough people

3576.16 --> 3580.64
that i get hung up on the people that i

3578.24 --> 3581.52
do meet and do not know how to open a

3580.64 --> 3584.4
communication

3581.52 --> 3585.359
and that even starts to make my

3584.4 --> 3587.2000000000003
imagination

3585.359 --> 3588.4
fill in details that it shouldn't do

3587.2 --> 3590.16
that

3588.4 --> 3592.0
because it usually ends up in a mistake

3590.16 --> 3593.04
that's my experience with that in the

3592.0 --> 3595.76
past

3593.04 --> 3598.16
yet because i don't meet enough people

3595.76 --> 3600.6400000000003
face to face

3598.16 --> 3602.16
the mistake is going to transpire

3600.64 --> 3604.4
whether i know it or not

3602.16 --> 3605.7599999999998
it is going to happen it's just going to

3604.4 --> 3609.599
process like that

3605.76 --> 3609.599
i know that from myself now

3609.76 --> 3617.5200000000004
and so i've been thinking like how do i

3614.319 --> 3620.24
engage once again

3617.52 --> 3620.64
where do i go what do i actually do out

3620.24 --> 3623.04
there

3620.64 --> 3624.799
to meet people because i kind of lost

3623.04 --> 3629.119
all my sources

3624.799 --> 3631.839
i literally lost

3629.119 --> 3633.52
excuses to basically go out and meet

3631.839 --> 3635.839
people

3633.52 --> 3637.359
because the places that i associated

3635.839 --> 3640.16
with gave me

3637.359 --> 3640.5589999999997
that groundworks to always be able to

3640.16 --> 3644.0
just

3640.559 --> 3647.119
go there party like that

3644.0 --> 3647.92
it's like my gothic days because when

3647.119 --> 3650.7200000000003
you're like that

3647.92 --> 3652.2400000000002
i just used it it's like yeah you can do

3650.72 --> 3655.359
that because i am

3652.24 --> 3657.4399999999996
that and then you do

3655.359 --> 3660.0
bump into new people a lot of stupid

3657.44 --> 3661.76
people too and even really repulsive

3660.0 --> 3664.319
people but sometimes you meet

3661.76 --> 3666.6400000000003
you at least meet new people in order to

3664.319 --> 3668.4
establish what is out there

3666.64 --> 3670.0789999999997
and then reflect yourself on it so

3668.4 --> 3671.839
there's always something to learn

3670.079 --> 3674.319
now i don't have that anymore because i

3671.839 --> 3677.359
don't associate

3674.319 --> 3677.359
with that anymore

3678.48 --> 3682.96
and now all i associate with in a

3681.28 --> 3684.7200000000003
certain way is flat earth but yeah

3682.96 --> 3687.599
that's only really online

3684.72 --> 3690.0789999999997
there's no thing out there and i don't

3687.599 --> 3691.839
want to end up in a physical

3690.079 --> 3694.1600000000003
group like that that's just going to be

3691.839 --> 3696.0
a few people constantly talking about it

3694.16 --> 3698.799
i already do that on the internet that's

3696.0 --> 3701.119
good enough for me

3698.799 --> 3704.079
i don't feel a need to have like this

3701.119 --> 3708.48
closed group of people that think alike

3704.079 --> 3708.48
no i actually feel more need to

3708.72 --> 3713.5989999999997
get out there and maybe figure it out on

3712.319 --> 3717.119
a superficial level

3713.599 --> 3719.52
a more superficial level because

3717.119 --> 3719.52
it's just

3720.319 --> 3723.839
i'm used to isolation but it's just

3722.559 --> 3725.76
getting to me a little

3723.839 --> 3727.839
i think maybe it's also the time of year

3725.76 --> 3729.28
maybe it's january i have also realized

3727.839 --> 3731.2
that it's just because of the certain

3729.28 --> 3732.3190000000004
type of mood that i now have a problem

3731.2 --> 3735.52
with this

3732.319 --> 3735.52
when in better days

3735.92 --> 3741.839
i have no problem with it at all

3749.359 --> 3758.24
what is going on in chat

3754.079 --> 3760.1600000000003
hey cameron gilmore yeah thanks for the

3758.24 --> 3761.7599999999998
the paypal donation buddy i really

3760.16 --> 3765.0389999999998
appreciate that

3761.76 --> 3768.7200000000003
you guys are really helping me

3765.039 --> 3770.48
lockdowns are shite yes yes i also

3768.72 --> 3783.839
realized that is that the freaking

3770.48 --> 3783.839
lockdown situation is not helping

3801.76 --> 3804.88
right so

3805.52 --> 3812.0
do i just have to dig like get a

3809.52 --> 3813.68
i don't want to even go there but to

3812.0 --> 3816.72
meet people

3813.68 --> 3819.68
social media and then just

3816.72 --> 3822.0789999999997
connect like that is that really because

3819.68 --> 3825.1189999999997
everywhere

3822.079 --> 3826.559
it seems to happen like that it's just

3825.119 --> 3828.96
you meet somebody

3826.559 --> 3831.28
you might like them and say like okay

3828.96 --> 3836.319
you got facebook or something and then

3831.28 --> 3841.8390000000004
you get to know them through that

3836.319 --> 3844.319
is that because i've always avoided that

3841.839 --> 3845.68
and now i kind of in my own way regret

3844.319 --> 3848.24
it but at least i

3845.68 --> 3850.24
in yeah i did it for a good reason and i

3848.24 --> 3851.0389999999998
if i would re-engage in anything like

3850.24 --> 3854.64
that

3851.039 --> 3854.6400000000003
specifically for that reason

3854.96 --> 3858.079
then at least i know the pitfalls and

3857.28 --> 3861.2000000000003
risks now

3858.079 --> 3862.1600000000003
very clearly i know what's going on much

3861.2 --> 3867.839
better

3862.16 --> 3867.839
than say 10 years ago or 20 years ago

3874.799 --> 3882.96
i see you guys are just going at it

3879.92 --> 3882.96
ballers in chat

3884.56 --> 3888.469
[Music]

3892.839 --> 3895.839
so

3906.839 --> 3909.839
what

3915.44 --> 3923.839
trying to mental train mental gymnastics

3919.92 --> 3923.839
on yourself

3925.44 --> 3930.2400000000002
into accepting fallacy fallacious

3927.839 --> 3934.839
arguments

3930.24 --> 3937.839
are okay no that's literally fooling

3934.839 --> 3937.839
yourself

3938.72 --> 3943.839
informal logic douglas walton

3948.839 --> 3951.839
okay

3958.72 --> 3964.64
that sounds really repulsive are you

3961.68 --> 3969.2
fight me

3964.64 --> 3969.2
that's literally a book on manipulation

3976.839 --> 3979.839
why

3989.52 --> 3994.96
ah hey lamel forever yeah i know you're

3991.44 --> 3994.96
not a bother i remember you

3999.76 --> 4006.6400000000003
all right yeah yeah well why it shrinks

4004.079 --> 4008.079
why the apparent moon shrinks or grows

4006.64 --> 4010.48
bigger

4008.079 --> 4012.0
uh well it's an apparent moon first so

4010.48 --> 4017.28
it's purely a light

4012.0 --> 4017.28
based optical effect side effect

4018.839 --> 4023.92
probably a correlation

4021.52 --> 4025.119
at least could be the thickness of the

4023.92 --> 4029.359
atmosphere

4025.119 --> 4029.359
that would cause it to appear smaller

4029.76 --> 4037.2000000000003
yeah that's and then as it goes up the

4034.16 --> 4040.72
amount of air pressure over there

4037.2 --> 4040.72
due to relative density

4041.52 --> 4047.0389999999998
uh lower density gases being more

4044.72 --> 4048.0789999999997
up there as you look up that yeah

4047.039 --> 4052.0
there's not going to be

4048.079 --> 4055.3590000000004
as much gas in between the apparent

4052.0 --> 4058.4
optical effect of the moon causing it to

4055.359 --> 4062.319
yeah seem a little bigger

4058.4 --> 4066.48
i think or is it the other way around uh

4062.319 --> 4066.48
no wait yeah it grows bigger

4067.76 --> 4073.599
right or does the moon get

4071.28 --> 4077.8390000000004
smaller as it approaches the horizon or

4073.599 --> 4077.839
does it get bigger

4078.88 --> 4082.0
i'm a little confused

4087.52 --> 4091.839
no it grows smaller

4093.359 --> 4097.199
so that would suggest it correlative

4096.48 --> 4100.0
wise

4097.199 --> 4100.0
a lensing

4102.799 --> 4107.12
isn't the layers horizontal

4116.839 --> 4119.839
what

4120.16 --> 4123.2789999999995
[Music]

4134.48 --> 4138.718999999999
yeah that's a good point samson if you

4136.88 --> 4140.96
don't first understand formal logic how

4138.719 --> 4142.319
could you understand how to use a formal

4140.96 --> 4147.839
logic

4142.319 --> 4147.839000000001
that's right a guns have never run rmp

4180.0 --> 4185.679
what a fallacy is never appropriate out

4183.04 --> 4185.679
of fight me

4185.759 --> 4192.56
and it can only be effective for

4189.44 --> 4193.839
yeah deviant tactics it's it's

4192.56 --> 4196.2390000000005
manipulation

4193.839 --> 4198.32
a fallacy is only ever functional as

4196.239 --> 4200.5599999999995
some kind of manipulation otherwise it

4198.32 --> 4204.719
is predefinition as a fallacy

4200.56 --> 4204.719
dysfunctional that's why it's a fallacy

4204.88 --> 4217.84
this is really odd that you would say it

4207.44 --> 4217.839999999999
like that

4233.52 --> 4241.040000000001
calling out fallacies okay

4237.84 --> 4242.84
well we don't really need a book for

4241.04 --> 4245.92
that at this point

4242.84 --> 4249.1990000000005
because we have live field

4245.92 --> 4250.96
studies lots of cases in practical

4249.199 --> 4254.08
reality

4250.96 --> 4256.96
interactively for study so we

4254.08 --> 4259.04
already kind of know the fallacies we

4256.96 --> 4260.2390000000005
have live examples we don't need to read

4259.04 --> 4262.96
a book about our

4260.239 --> 4265.759999999999
i don't need to read a book about it to

4262.96 --> 4265.76
recognize it

4267.04 --> 4270.88
this statement that there is some kind

4268.56 --> 4273.360000000001
of appropriate time to

4270.88 --> 4277.28
apply a fallacy is just a ridiculous

4273.36 --> 4277.28
that's that's a really silly thing to

4284.84 --> 4287.84
say

4298.84 --> 4301.84
hmm

4312.84 --> 4315.84
hmm

4315.87 --> 4324.51
[Music]

4328.719 --> 4334.4
gaslighting red herring oh

4332.08 --> 4335.44
well audio fight me let me give you an

4334.4 --> 4337.36
example

4335.44 --> 4340.719
how about saying that there is an

4337.36 --> 4343.36
appropriate time to apply a fallacy

4340.719 --> 4345.6
how about that one sounds pretty gas

4343.36 --> 4347.5199999999995
lighting and red herring to me

4345.6 --> 4349.679
doesn't have to do anything with any

4347.52 --> 4350.8
technical flat earth versus globe

4349.679 --> 4353.6
arguments

4350.8 --> 4355.679
and it is just wrong and it's basically

4353.6 --> 4357.76
trying to convince us that applying

4355.679 --> 4360.08
fallacies okay that sounds pretty damn

4357.76 --> 4363.280000000001
red herring and gaslighting to me

4360.08 --> 4371.84
so i think that seeking star wars kind

4363.28 --> 4371.84
of called it

4395.199 --> 4400.32
what the [ __ ] mark zweiler what are

4397.28 --> 4400.32
you blabbering about

4405.76 --> 4413.84
and why are you repeating the same [ __ ]

4407.76 --> 4413.84
over and over again

4424.84 --> 4428.64
no what the [ __ ] why are you putting

4427.44 --> 4432.239
that in my mouth

4428.64 --> 4434.96
i never said that no their fallacies

4432.239 --> 4436.799999999999
are always wrong when you apply a

4434.96 --> 4440.08
fallacy you literally make an

4436.8 --> 4444.0
error there is no appropriate time to

4440.08 --> 4444.719
apply an error kind of an idiotic

4444.0 --> 4447.12
statement

4444.719 --> 4447.12
come on

4450.8 --> 4454.320000000001
oh there are good fallacies are there oh

4453.199 --> 4456.159
really

4454.32 --> 4457.44
that's really cute that you believe that

4456.159 --> 4460.32
there is such a thing as good

4457.44 --> 4460.32
fallacies that's

4460.48 --> 4469.839999999999
really deluded of you but fine

4481.679 --> 4485.04
well mark smiler

4485.52 --> 4489.360000000001
have you ever realized that i am not

4488.08 --> 4493.44
obligated

4489.36 --> 4496.96
to read out your stuff yeah

4493.44 --> 4500.48
you are not my dictator what you have to

4496.96 --> 4504.159
say i have no obligation to read

4500.48 --> 4505.36
anything about that and your giant piles

4504.159 --> 4508.239
of text

4505.36 --> 4509.5199999999995
they're not really that interesting a

4508.239 --> 4513.36
lot of it is just

4509.52 --> 4516.96
old stuff rehashed in your way

4513.36 --> 4519.12
i'm not that interested so i don't owe

4516.96 --> 4519.12
you

4522.84 --> 4527.92
anything

4525.6 --> 4529.84
and i think you need to to drop that

4527.92 --> 4533.1990000000005
attitude it's it's getting kind of on my

4529.84 --> 4533.1990000000005
nerves it's getting annoying

4554.08 --> 4558.159
gas lighting about the flat earth oh

4557.04 --> 4563.12
really

4558.159 --> 4565.679
so you think that it's okay to just

4563.12 --> 4567.44
this is this is just preposterous dude

4565.679 --> 4571.4400000000005
how do you fight me i'm just

4567.44 --> 4571.44
this far away from just kicking you out

4572.0 --> 4575.28
what else is it going to be gaslighting

4574.0 --> 4577.6
about

4575.28 --> 4579.44
you're a baller aren't you and you

4577.6 --> 4581.52
literally just declared oh look at this

4579.44 --> 4584.678999999999
book it's really interesting

4581.52 --> 4588.64
because it tells you when it is

4584.679 --> 4595.4400000000005
appropriate to apply a fallacy

4588.64 --> 4598.2390000000005
are you listening to yourself man

4595.44 --> 4599.28
no i'm not you don't care about the

4598.239 --> 4603.12
shape of the ear oh

4599.28 --> 4606.719
okay okay well then your

4603.12 --> 4608.8
cosmogeny neutral diluted

4606.719 --> 4610.8
still deluded there is no appropriate

4608.8 --> 4613.84
time to apply a fallacy

4610.8 --> 4616.8
it's called manipulation

4613.84 --> 4618.08
it's not a good tactic it's to fool the

4616.8 --> 4621.1990000000005
opponent

4618.08 --> 4624.159
if they fall for it it's bad

4621.199 --> 4625.12
false maybe you could classify it good

4624.159 --> 4628.4
in the range of

4625.12 --> 4628.96
politics perhaps it's not really my

4628.4 --> 4632.719
thing

4628.96 --> 4636.0
see i like to be honest about things

4632.719 --> 4640.2390000000005
and get things right those i see as

4636.0 --> 4651.84
virtues not a correct time to apply

4640.239 --> 4651.839999999999
a fallacy seriously

4655.04 --> 4662.4
oh i don't understand really

4659.04 --> 4665.36
so how maybe

4662.4 --> 4666.879999999999
somebody could give me an alternative

4665.36 --> 4670.0
way to

4666.88 --> 4672.2390000000005
interpret an appropriate time to apply a

4670.0 --> 4674.32
fallacy

4672.239 --> 4676.5599999999995
maybe somebody could explain that to me

4674.32 --> 4680.0
in a way that is

4676.56 --> 4682.080000000001
not deluded or morally dubious

4680.0 --> 4684.8
because i don't see any other way to

4682.08 --> 4684.8
interpret that

4690.84 --> 4693.84
sorry

4704.84 --> 4707.84
okay

4710.88 --> 4714.96
if you don't care about the shape of the

4712.64 --> 4714.96
earth

4715.04 --> 4718.84
might as well remain a well-trained lab

4717.76 --> 4735.84
rat

4718.84 --> 4735.84
well i wouldn't go that far

4740.0 --> 4742.4
you know

4743.199 --> 4746.96
there's plenty of people that literally

4745.12 --> 4751.36
don't care

4746.96 --> 4753.52
but they will look more at behavior

4751.36 --> 4756.159
and some will look at behavior for what

4753.52 --> 4757.92
is the weaning behavior like oh can they

4756.159 --> 4761.199
manipulate like a

4757.92 --> 4764.32
like a pro and get to the top that

4761.199 --> 4767.36
way of looking at other people or like

4764.32 --> 4770.719
do they actually have integrity

4767.36 --> 4776.48
and yeah then it's a matter of

4770.719 --> 4779.76
how serious do they take it

4776.48 --> 4781.678999999999
so i think yeah you don't necessarily

4779.76 --> 4786.08
have to be

4781.679 --> 4786.08
a cosmetic cosmogeny interested

4787.12 --> 4790.96
you can still be a good yeah yeah you

4789.36 --> 4793.199
don't have to be a slave if you're not

4790.96 --> 4796.2390000000005
interested in that

4793.199 --> 4798.32
and there's plenty of people that know

4796.239 --> 4800.239
that are not necessarily a baller that

4798.32 --> 4801.44
just wouldn't care that still realize

4800.239 --> 4804.718999999999
that the world

4801.44 --> 4807.04
has a lot of liars in it

4804.719 --> 4807.76
no and the people might casually say

4807.04 --> 4809.679
like yeah

4807.76 --> 4811.4400000000005
sure the earth might be flat you might

4809.679 --> 4814.08
be right but i'm not

4811.44 --> 4816.159
interested they don't have to

4814.08 --> 4817.199
necessarily default on believing the

4816.159 --> 4820.0
ball like that

4817.199 --> 4821.839999999999
not everybody does that some people just

4820.0 --> 4824.159
don't really care that much

4821.84 --> 4825.6
they do realize that there's a lot of

4824.159 --> 4833.839999999999
lies going on and big

4825.6 --> 4833.84
lie stories

4844.84 --> 4847.84
what

4857.52 --> 4862.159000000001
wait are you fighting are you talking

4859.44 --> 4864.4
about calling out fallacies

4862.159 --> 4866.5599999999995
because that would place it into a whole

4864.4 --> 4868.32
new context

4866.56 --> 4870.0
you did you should have done that before

4868.32 --> 4873.84
if that is what you meant because

4870.0 --> 4875.92
every time you didn't emphasize that you

4873.84 --> 4876.88
just set the right time to apply a

4875.92 --> 4879.92
fallacy

4876.88 --> 4883.76
as in the one who is actually making

4879.92 --> 4886.8
a declaration making a claim

4883.76 --> 4887.360000000001
fallaciously like what is the right time

4886.8 --> 4889.4400000000005
to

4887.36 --> 4891.44
be fallacious that's basically the way

4889.44 --> 4894.159
you said it

4891.44 --> 4895.28
calling out fallacies jesus it's like

4894.159 --> 4896.719
english not your first

4895.28 --> 4898.48
language because that's like the

4896.719 --> 4899.36
clumsiest way you could have ever said

4898.48 --> 4902.638999999999
that

4899.36 --> 4905.92
persistently mind you

4902.639 --> 4917.84
[ __ ] be

4905.92 --> 4917.84
back in two minutes

4984.84 --> 4987.84
so

4998.84 --> 5001.84
okay

5026.84 --> 5029.84
hmm

5039.12 --> 5045.679
i don't know what audio fight me is

5042.8 --> 5046.56
supposedly not a flat earther or a

5045.679 --> 5049.84
baller

5046.56 --> 5054.320000000001
not interested might just be an

5049.84 --> 5057.4400000000005
act but yeah this whole notion about the

5054.32 --> 5060.0
right moment to apply a fallacy

5057.44 --> 5061.04
it's just ridiculous and we don't need

5060.0 --> 5064.4
to learn

5061.04 --> 5068.08
tactics from a book we have

5064.4 --> 5070.5599999999995
live examples of tactics all the time

5068.08 --> 5072.32
which is much better to train you in

5070.56 --> 5085.780000000001
that sort of thing

5072.32 --> 5088.0
yes i know you're a baller tiny womble

5085.78 --> 5090.48
[Music]

5088.0 --> 5091.44
at least you're not trying to tell

5090.48 --> 5094.48
people that it

5091.44 --> 5096.839999999999
there's a right time to apply a fallacy

5094.48 --> 5099.839999999999
you know at least you got that going for

5096.84 --> 5099.84
you

5101.36 --> 5104.5599999999995
even though you might be thinking it at

5104.0 --> 5113.84
least you're

5104.56 --> 5113.84
wise enough not to say that

5119.92 --> 5124.08
clovers that have an agenda usually say

5122.48 --> 5124.638999999999
they don't care about the shape of the

5124.08 --> 5126.8
earth

5124.639 --> 5129.679
yeah yeah they all they do in the heat

5126.8 --> 5129.679
of the argument

5130.88 --> 5137.6
i've even heard like really

5133.92 --> 5137.6
obvious ballers say that too

5137.92 --> 5140.96
like people over at jose's that they

5140.32 --> 5143.12
would just

5140.96 --> 5145.12
let's they would be like oh let's just

5143.12 --> 5147.28
lay that down like i'm not gonna care

5145.12 --> 5149.92
about that right now

5147.28 --> 5150.88
right because that's not the entire

5149.92 --> 5152.96
reason you've

5150.88 --> 5155.12
brought forth the entire argument in the

5152.96 --> 5156.88
first place right then they just try to

5155.12 --> 5158.639
suggest like no no

5156.88 --> 5162.0
right now it's not going to be about

5158.639 --> 5165.4400000000005
proving the ball right

5162.0 --> 5166.4
because it's like you would ever do

5165.44 --> 5169.839999999999
anything

5166.4 --> 5171.28
towards us that isn't purely because of

5169.84 --> 5173.6
that

5171.28 --> 5176.48
although sometimes they just say nice

5173.6 --> 5178.4800000000005
nice things just to be nice

5176.48 --> 5180.5599999999995
because they still have to kind of give

5178.48 --> 5184.239
off some kind of resemblance like they

5180.56 --> 5184.2390000000005
do have a human nature left

5184.719 --> 5188.159
which is kind of a good thing you know

5186.88 --> 5191.84
we don't always need

5188.159 --> 5194.08
to be 100 psychological warfare all the

5191.84 --> 5194.08
time

5194.239 --> 5199.5199999999995
that way they can remain a little bit

5196.0 --> 5199.52
more human and all

5206.8 --> 5211.84
yeah that's a good one samson indeed

5208.88 --> 5211.84
they do

5248.239 --> 5253.839999999999
right cool

5258.239 --> 5267.839999999999
hmm hey 101 rock count

5261.44 --> 5267.839999999999
late again yeah indeed

5268.48 --> 5281.839999999999
ah well it's good to see so many people

5270.719 --> 5281.84
in the chat

5289.84 --> 5298.32
right well you know samson in a way

5294.88 --> 5301.679
it could be the main branch of their

5298.32 --> 5303.599999999999
philosophical attempt right

5301.679 --> 5305.28
globe is technically a philosophy so

5303.6 --> 5308.96
they will

5305.28 --> 5312.96
yeah since they need fallacies to be

5308.96 --> 5314.56
overlooked in their model explanation

5312.96 --> 5318.0
and defense

5314.56 --> 5320.080000000001
then yeah it's very useful and they have

5318.0 --> 5321.36
they've already have some back work for

5320.08 --> 5324.5599999999995
this

5321.36 --> 5327.679
from within philosophy to basically

5324.56 --> 5331.1990000000005
reify to argue why

5327.679 --> 5333.12
reification or fallacies in general

5331.199 --> 5334.799999999999
should be allowed you know and if they

5333.12 --> 5336.88
can't just fully reify

5334.8 --> 5338.08
something then start with something

5336.88 --> 5340.400000000001
small

5338.08 --> 5342.639
just like oh no you can apply some

5340.4 --> 5343.28
fallacies in some cases and then as soon

5342.639 --> 5346.0
as people

5343.28 --> 5348.639
officially start to accept that then

5346.0 --> 5350.719
over the ages

5348.639 --> 5352.639
it will probably start to apply some

5350.719 --> 5354.56
more and more and then suddenly they

5352.639 --> 5357.12
don't have a ground to stand on

5354.56 --> 5359.1990000000005
when confronted with a baller anymore

5357.12 --> 5361.12
and saying but no that's a fallacy and

5359.199 --> 5363.44
then they say but you apply fallacies

5361.12 --> 5367.679
all the time

5363.44 --> 5370.96
you see and that way yeah you don't

5367.679 --> 5374.4
you don't have logic anymore

5370.96 --> 5378.159
to take them down with so yeah

5374.4 --> 5380.5599999999995
of course convincing everybody that

5378.159 --> 5384.08
applying fallacies is okay

5380.56 --> 5388.56
is going to be a primary objective

5384.08 --> 5388.5599999999995
at some point maybe already is

5389.679 --> 5393.679
you know it's like saying no lying is

5391.679 --> 5396.719
okay lying is okay guys

5393.679 --> 5398.96
so little lies blah blah blah explaining

5396.719 --> 5399.52
in all kinds of ways and when and why

5398.96 --> 5402.0
and then

5399.52 --> 5403.4400000000005
just say nah but that means you can push

5402.0 --> 5405.76
it a little

5403.44 --> 5408.96
and then a little more and little more

5405.76 --> 5421.84
and before you know it you're a baller

5408.96 --> 5421.84
not you specifically tiny wumbo

5426.32 --> 5435.84
or a baller or a politician or

5430.08 --> 5435.84
i think you guys know what i mean

5455.92 --> 5460.2390000000005
well guns have never owned it would be

5457.679 --> 5461.4400000000005
interesting to have more specific leads

5460.239 --> 5463.5199999999995
to this

5461.44 --> 5467.36
because i bet they are it's even to

5463.52 --> 5467.360000000001
think been declared at times

5467.44 --> 5477.839999999999
but it would be good to have some real

5470.0 --> 5477.84
proof for that

5478.159 --> 5483.36
i think it's slightly different in

5480.239 --> 5483.36
reality i think that

5484.48 --> 5492.32
the need to defend your own dream

5488.08 --> 5497.12
is probably what propels the globers

5492.32 --> 5500.719
more but that it is also being

5497.12 --> 5501.92
digitally subtly encouraged so you get

5500.719 --> 5503.92
more rich you get

5501.92 --> 5505.679
more people that would typically be

5503.92 --> 5506.719
willing to subscribe to that sort of

5505.679 --> 5508.719
thing

5506.719 --> 5509.92
not because there's more of them but

5508.719 --> 5514.0
because their

5509.92 --> 5516.4800000000005
the gates will specifically help you

5514.0 --> 5518.48
people will find you you will get you

5516.48 --> 5521.04
suggested and that way

5518.48 --> 5522.879999999999
yeah you'll be more successful i think

5521.04 --> 5524.48
it works that way i don't even know for

5522.88 --> 5526.08
sure if anybody ever got

5524.48 --> 5528.239
literally paid it's just that the

5526.08 --> 5531.84
algorithm will help you out

5528.239 --> 5534.239
will favor you more if you engage as a

5531.84 --> 5534.2390000000005
baller

5538.96 --> 5544.2390000000005
and in that way yeah you will get

5542.08 --> 5545.679
indirect sponsors you will be made more

5544.239 --> 5548.959999999999
successful

5545.679 --> 5552.4
gradually slightly depending

5548.96 --> 5552.4
on how much you put into it

5553.679 --> 5558.0
and how much confidence you inspire in

5556.0 --> 5558.84
the other ballers on the internet

5558.0 --> 5561.84
basically

5558.84 --> 5561.84
right

5564.719 --> 5568.159
but if you do that then at the same time

5567.44 --> 5570.4
yeah

5568.159 --> 5575.839999999999
when you inspire confidence you will get

5570.4 --> 5575.839999999999
a lot of people

5577.52 --> 5581.360000000001
it's like natural charisma pool if

5579.679 --> 5583.1990000000005
you're just very confident

5581.36 --> 5586.32
all the time you will draw in people

5583.199 --> 5586.32
that's just how it works

5586.8 --> 5590.8
and if the algorithm helps you out by

5589.52 --> 5593.76
making you

5590.8 --> 5596.4800000000005
visible then that way you will draw on a

5593.76 --> 5596.4800000000005
lot of people

5599.6 --> 5604.320000000001
right and so like that i sometimes feel

5602.639 --> 5608.56
gaslighted

5604.32 --> 5609.759999999999
by youtube and the algorithm

5608.56 --> 5612.080000000001
because i don't have a lot of

5609.76 --> 5617.4400000000005
subscribers

5612.08 --> 5619.679
yet i have i'm very confident

5617.44 --> 5621.199
in the way that i put things down and

5619.679 --> 5631.84
i'm very open and honest

5621.199 --> 5631.839999999999
which is a sign of confidence

5633.76 --> 5642.400000000001
right but yeah it is what it is

5638.4 --> 5644.799999999999
also i did notice by the way that i have

5642.4 --> 5645.5199999999995
my amount of subscribers have grown

5644.8 --> 5649.2390000000005
slightly

5645.52 --> 5653.040000000001
so i now have a 1

5649.239 --> 5656.32
840 something subscribers these days so

5653.04 --> 5658.08
yeah a couple of hundred have subscribed

5656.32 --> 5658.96
recently now of course i've noticed that

5658.08 --> 5661.12
in chat

5658.96 --> 5662.88
by just new people joining the show and

5661.12 --> 5663.92
those are the types of subscribers i

5662.88 --> 5666.32
like the most

5663.92 --> 5667.04
the ones that actually show up and not

5666.32 --> 5672.0
just look at

5667.04 --> 5674.32
me and look at me from a distance

5672.0 --> 5677.679
but yeah what if the algorithm would

5674.32 --> 5677.679
suddenly open the gates

5678.239 --> 5687.839999999999
suddenly like that then yeah a whole

5682.239 --> 5687.839999999999
bunch of people would be piling on

5688.88 --> 5695.119
what what are you talking about here we

5692.639 --> 5695.119
go again

5698.84 --> 5701.84
huh

5717.679 --> 5722.159
notifications demonetization oh really

5720.56 --> 5724.96
well that's not really the things i'm

5722.159 --> 5724.96
complaining about

5725.679 --> 5730.08
the notification look that's just

5727.679 --> 5730.56
technicals and the demonetization that's

5730.08 --> 5733.679
about

5730.56 --> 5735.280000000001
what you bring to the table i don't

5733.679 --> 5738.4
complain about that a lot

5735.28 --> 5738.4
it's not the same thing

5740.32 --> 5743.84
tiny womble

5743.92 --> 5748.4
but i'm sure that the ballers complain

5746.08 --> 5750.08
about that a lot

5748.4 --> 5751.44
now i'm talking about something

5750.08 --> 5757.84
different i'm talking about

5751.44 --> 5757.839999999999
algorithm reach

5758.159 --> 5762.638999999999
because the algorithm can absolutely

5760.639 --> 5766.719
help you out

5762.639 --> 5770.0
like that but on the other hand

5766.719 --> 5772.159
i don't know man maybe i just because of

5770.0 --> 5774.0
who i am because of what i do i don't

5772.159 --> 5776.48
appeal to a lot of people maybe a lot of

5774.0 --> 5777.119
people just think i'm a weirdo no matter

5776.48 --> 5778.959999999999
what

5777.119 --> 5781.44
and in a way they're right i am kind of

5778.96 --> 5784.56
a weirdo

5781.44 --> 5787.599999999999
and not just with a regular

5784.56 --> 5788.719
solid guy with a quirk no i'm pretty

5787.6 --> 5791.84
much a weirdo

5788.719 --> 5794.159
i know i am i've been very open about it

5791.84 --> 5797.28
i'm trying to figure it out

5794.159 --> 5798.638999999999
i'm trying to figure myself out and i

5797.28 --> 5803.119
think i'm doing pretty good

5798.639 --> 5803.119
so far but there's still more to go

5803.44 --> 5808.48
but i my vantage point was from somebody

5808.719 --> 5814.08
that in many ways socially it's

5811.76 --> 5817.04
completely lost

5814.08 --> 5819.04
but yeah that was not because of flat

5817.04 --> 5821.36
earth it's just that flat earth was kind

5819.04 --> 5823.36
of the first it was a real big project

5821.36 --> 5826.88
for me

5823.36 --> 5828.159
that is yeah that i'm very enthusiastic

5826.88 --> 5830.8
about and that i feel

5828.159 --> 5832.638999999999
i can actually mechanically contribute

5830.8 --> 5835.360000000001
something for real

5832.639 --> 5835.36
and i have

5835.92 --> 5840.8
but i've always been this i've always

5838.239 --> 5843.5199999999995
been a weirdo

5840.8 --> 5845.119000000001
i've been weirder than this there were

5843.52 --> 5848.4800000000005
times where i literally

5845.119 --> 5849.28
would not put any form of restraints on

5848.48 --> 5852.959999999999
myself

5849.28 --> 5855.5199999999995
in my behavior and i would be very weird

5852.96 --> 5858.0
like really weird this is this is all

5855.52 --> 5859.679
very controlled

5858.0 --> 5861.28
except for the moment when i get really

5859.679 --> 5863.04
pissed off

5861.28 --> 5864.719
and that's a big difference because back

5863.04 --> 5867.36
in the past

5864.719 --> 5868.4
that pissed off side i would never show

5867.36 --> 5872.96
it

5868.4 --> 5876.96
i would never show it i was afraid of it

5872.96 --> 5876.96
i was afraid of getting angry even

5877.52 --> 5882.0
because it just pumped too much hormones

5881.76 --> 5884.719
in

5882.0 --> 5886.32
me and i would not be able to control

5884.719 --> 5888.159
myself

5886.32 --> 5890.0
and yeah even these days when i get

5888.159 --> 5892.159
really fired up

5890.0 --> 5894.0
probably to a lot of people it already

5892.159 --> 5897.199
looks like kind of out of control

5894.0 --> 5898.96
almost even though the physical actions

5897.199 --> 5900.32
i have that very much under control

5898.96 --> 5904.0
never done anything

5900.32 --> 5906.5599999999995
to anybody physically

5904.0 --> 5907.52
but can you imagine that even like 20

5906.56 --> 5911.52
years ago

5907.52 --> 5916.4800000000005
it was worse it was bad enough for me to

5911.52 --> 5916.4800000000005
basically just not let it out at all

5917.119 --> 5924.88
so i felt like i was not allowed

5921.76 --> 5927.679
to be emotional

5924.88 --> 5928.719
to have a demo an emotional experience

5927.679 --> 5932.8
in life

5928.719 --> 5934.88
other than just happiness or something

5932.8 --> 5936.88
and express it show it to others i i

5934.88 --> 5937.6
felt like i wasn't allowed that it was

5936.88 --> 5940.0
dangerous

5937.6 --> 5942.159000000001
and the times that i did actually like

5940.0 --> 5945.04
open the gates 100

5942.159 --> 5947.679
without much control or oversight yeah

5945.04 --> 5950.84
that did get me into trouble

5947.679 --> 5952.639
it absolutely polarized everyone and

5950.84 --> 5954.639
everything

5952.639 --> 5956.88
and sometimes i would just through my

5954.639 --> 5959.119
own clumsiness and short-sightedness end

5956.88 --> 5961.52
up in situations where

5959.119 --> 5962.48
i got really despised in a moment

5961.52 --> 5965.280000000001
because i

5962.48 --> 5967.839999999999
chose to contradict something in the

5965.28 --> 5967.84
wrong time

5968.48 --> 5972.959999999999
just because i could just because i felt

5970.56 --> 5972.96
like it

5975.36 --> 5980.88
when people really did not want that

5978.8 --> 5983.1990000000005
in those moments and i would do it

5980.88 --> 5986.2390000000005
anyway because it was like

5983.199 --> 5988.719
my way in a way yeah to attention grab

5986.239 --> 5989.44
it was a bad habit it was like live

5988.719 --> 5995.84
trolling

5989.44 --> 5995.839999999999
and it wasn't even on the internet

5996.4 --> 6000.239
but yeah that was sort of my autopilot

5998.96 --> 6003.84
and it

6000.239 --> 6005.759999999999
didn't really help out a lot so

6003.84 --> 6008.88
now i do things differently and i'm

6005.76 --> 6011.6
trying to give my

6008.88 --> 6011.6
emotions

6013.04 --> 6016.45
some some room to manifest to

6016.239 --> 6019.36
and

6016.45 --> 6022.8
[Music]

6019.36 --> 6026.48
figure out how to

6022.8 --> 6026.96
humanly reintegrate with the people and

6026.48 --> 6030.08
how

6026.96 --> 6032.32
everything has become out there

6030.08 --> 6034.32
and for that i cannot close off my

6032.32 --> 6034.719
emotions anymore because that has been

6034.32 --> 6038.5599999999995
the

6034.719 --> 6038.56
mess the biggest obstacle

6038.96 --> 6044.2390000000005
the biggest obstacle in my ability to

6042.32 --> 6045.5199999999995
connect with other people physically out

6044.239 --> 6049.04
there

6045.52 --> 6053.1990000000005
it's been having gates on my emotion

6049.04 --> 6053.199
being my own emotional gatekeeper

6053.82 --> 6059.04
[Music]

6055.44 --> 6059.759999999999
when yeah the most effective way to just

6059.04 --> 6064.32
communicate

6059.76 --> 6067.04
is not having so much weight hung on it

6064.32 --> 6068.719
just being yourself just being my silly

6067.04 --> 6071.76
self don't have to overdo

6068.719 --> 6075.119
anything just being myself

6071.76 --> 6077.52
and not having so much weight on the

6075.119 --> 6080.88
situation is usually enough to

6077.52 --> 6081.360000000001
get through things because i build up

6080.88 --> 6084.4800000000005
tension

6081.36 --> 6085.5199999999995
and then again correlating ideas that

6084.48 --> 6088.239
overreach

6085.52 --> 6088.8
it happens every time i get socially

6088.239 --> 6091.28
tense

6088.8 --> 6093.84
tense about like trying to connect with

6091.28 --> 6093.84
somebody

6099.199 --> 6103.199
i do piss on my subscribers sometimes

6102.4 --> 6108.799999999999
what

6103.199 --> 6108.799999999999
what are you talking about how do i do

6118.84 --> 6121.84
that

6120.0 --> 6125.199
you mean i can be a little bit blunt

6121.84 --> 6125.1990000000005
sometimes yeah

6126.96 --> 6130.0
you've know i've been the opposite as

6129.04 --> 6133.28
well right

6130.0 --> 6137.119
like very careful

6133.28 --> 6141.04
very nurturing i've been like that

6137.119 --> 6141.04
pretty much up to a few months ago

6141.679 --> 6144.639
talk down to them

6144.88 --> 6152.8
really you mean i point

6148.0 --> 6152.8
out mistakes try to correct them

6154.48 --> 6157.759999999999
addressing faults

6159.44 --> 6163.839999999999
or just say i don't think this is funny

6170.88 --> 6175.679
do i anybody in the chat just

6175.76 --> 6179.04
hey creation bear

6180.0 --> 6187.44
no but who knows maybe there's a

6184.8 --> 6189.1990000000005
you do but your delivery is abrupt and

6187.44 --> 6193.919999999999
demeaning

6189.199 --> 6197.5199999999995
is it though is that the meaning

6193.92 --> 6198.4
you think i should like when somebody is

6197.52 --> 6200.4800000000005
just

6198.4 --> 6202.719
doing something that i dislike should i

6200.48 --> 6203.599999999999
just take all my emotions back in that

6202.719 --> 6206.0
moment and then

6203.6 --> 6209.1990000000005
carefully try to break it to them is

6206.0 --> 6209.199
that how i should do it

6210.0 --> 6214.4
because that's what i tried to do in the

6211.92 --> 6219.84
past you know where that led me

6214.4 --> 6219.839999999999
absolutely nowhere

6223.28 --> 6227.28
guess of course he's taking me for a

6225.119 --> 6227.92
ride but sometimes she just got to take

6227.28 --> 6230.84
the ride

6227.92 --> 6233.84
and then just get off at the right

6230.84 --> 6233.84
moment

6251.119 --> 6254.799999999999
right but hey look in a way i agree yeah

6254.239 --> 6258.839999999999
i can be

6254.8 --> 6260.56
rude well you know what just point it

6258.84 --> 6263.679
out

6260.56 --> 6265.76
because if i've actually hurt somebody

6263.679 --> 6267.4400000000005
with being a little bit blunt i think

6265.76 --> 6270.4800000000005
you can call it just being blunt

6267.44 --> 6272.239
right that is how they say that just

6270.48 --> 6275.119
being blunt i'm being very blunt

6272.239 --> 6276.239
a lot of the time i just ram it in there

6275.119 --> 6278.4
just like that

6276.239 --> 6281.04
not because i want to hurt them it's

6278.4 --> 6284.638999999999
just because

6281.04 --> 6285.92
that's the quickest it's the quickest

6284.639 --> 6289.84
and that way

6285.92 --> 6289.84
i don't have to hang on to it so much

6289.92 --> 6296.719
yeah nathan is yeah but nathan is just

6293.119 --> 6299.04
nathan just really bashes but

6296.719 --> 6301.36
people know that it's like yeah it's

6299.04 --> 6303.76
it's a guy with a really big club

6301.36 --> 6305.599999999999
wisconsin there's like dents everywhere

6303.76 --> 6307.4400000000005
and blood laying on the ground yeah

6305.6 --> 6308.639
yeah if you step up to them guess what's

6307.44 --> 6311.919999999999
going to happen

6308.639 --> 6313.119
you know that's nathan now i'm not that

6311.92 --> 6315.679
blunt

6313.119 --> 6317.36
because it's not my shtick it's not what

6315.679 --> 6319.4400000000005
i do

6317.36 --> 6320.4
it's not what i'm doing on my show it's

6319.44 --> 6331.839999999999
not what i'm here for

6320.4 --> 6331.839999999999
overall but i am kind of blunt

6333.36 --> 6337.599999999999
thank you adamican i really appreciate

6335.679 --> 6342.08
that

6337.6 --> 6344.56
yes and the same goes for you by the way

6342.08 --> 6345.679
and you are one of those guys that is

6344.56 --> 6348.88
not blunt

6345.679 --> 6350.8
even though i i feel through empathy in

6348.88 --> 6352.96
those moments that you definitely have

6350.8 --> 6354.719
those feelings but you know somehow how

6352.96 --> 6357.199
to

6354.719 --> 6359.84
hold that back in a very gentlemanly

6357.199 --> 6359.839999999999
like way

6363.119 --> 6367.199
but i i just don't have the patience for

6365.92 --> 6370.56
that sometimes you know

6367.199 --> 6371.119
i have maybe yeah i don't know what it

6370.56 --> 6373.1990000000005
is

6371.119 --> 6374.32
it's just my emotions get a little bit

6373.199 --> 6377.759999999999
too strong to

6374.32 --> 6377.759999999999
hold it all back like that

6381.119 --> 6384.4
and other times i am more into just like

6384.0 --> 6387.76
not

6384.4 --> 6389.839999999999
being so on the front

6387.76 --> 6391.6
i said there's times where i just

6389.84 --> 6392.88
literally just sit back

6391.6 --> 6394.96
you know you can even hear it on the

6392.88 --> 6396.88
flat earth debates

6394.96 --> 6398.56
that at times i'm just like almost like

6396.88 --> 6400.32
tenth man every constantly in

6398.56 --> 6402.080000000001
everybody's face

6400.32 --> 6403.84
until i notice like okay i'm getting

6402.08 --> 6406.8
annoying now

6403.84 --> 6408.639
let others take over because it's just

6406.8 --> 6411.119000000001
like i would be annoyed

6408.639 --> 6413.679
if i would watch that back i can feel

6411.119 --> 6415.839999999999
that now

6413.679 --> 6417.76
and other times i'm not so upfront and

6415.84 --> 6420.08
then i'm just much more

6417.76 --> 6421.119000000001
sitting outside of the circle as it's

6420.08 --> 6422.88
all going

6421.119 --> 6425.839999999999
and then finding my moments to just

6422.88 --> 6425.84
certainly get in there and just

6426.8 --> 6432.159000000001
do something really concise quickly

6430.08 --> 6434.239
and i function very well like that but

6432.159 --> 6437.119
it's a different type of strategy

6434.239 --> 6439.5199999999995
of approach it did it all depends on my

6437.119 --> 6441.599999999999
mood sometimes i just

6439.52 --> 6443.52
i'm ready for the frontline sometimes i

6441.6 --> 6446.88
kind of sit in the back

6443.52 --> 6457.84
and just pick out my moments more like

6446.88 --> 6457.84
hit and run

6458.639 --> 6462.56
eight tera306 thanks

6468.8 --> 6472.8
oh getting out of the hospital in three

6470.56 --> 6474.400000000001
hours nice good to hear guns have never

6472.8 --> 6485.84
run rmp

6474.4 --> 6485.839999999999
man you've been in there for a while

6502.96 --> 6506.8
yeah but good to hear you're gonna

6509.679 --> 6514.639
please be able to get back home and all

6512.4 --> 6514.638999999999
that

6538.84 --> 6543.28
god

6540.4 --> 6545.199
your blood pressure was a bit up what

6543.28 --> 6554.88
the hell does that have to do with covet

6545.199 --> 6558.0
19 that's just ridiculous

6554.88 --> 6560.32
uh teret 3006.

6558.0 --> 6560.32
i

6561.04 --> 6564.8
if that's not really true

6565.04 --> 6572.0
although it might be becoming true

6568.719 --> 6574.96
but like even a year ago there's flat

6572.0 --> 6578.159
earthers going to global channels

6574.96 --> 6583.84
to do their flat earthing

6578.159 --> 6583.839999999999
on a regular basis so i wouldn't be that

6584.719 --> 6589.92
i wouldn't say that there's definitely

6588.239 --> 6592.159
flat earthers also

6589.92 --> 6594.0
globe channel trolling and hey it can be

6592.159 --> 6595.679
a lot of fun to just get in there and

6594.0 --> 6597.52
suddenly

6595.679 --> 6598.8
just putting down the housekeeping

6597.52 --> 6601.84
questions and all that

6598.8 --> 6606.719
it is funny to do but

6601.84 --> 6606.719
yeah it's not like that's all we ever do

6607.84 --> 6614.4800000000005
well last time i did it was with the

6611.119 --> 6615.839999999999
with kent hovind whose work in

6614.48 --> 6618.879999999999
creationism is really

6615.84 --> 6621.52
nice and awesome very

6618.88 --> 6622.159000000001
thankful for that it helped me back in

6621.52 --> 6625.280000000001
the day

6622.159 --> 6626.799999999999
but yeah he's like this tenacious glober

6625.28 --> 6628.5599999999995
that even believes in the modern iron

6626.8 --> 6631.76
core and all that so

6628.56 --> 6632.400000000001
but it's just and like with becky that

6631.76 --> 6634.639
time

6632.4 --> 6636.32
it's funny to do that it's not doesn't

6634.639 --> 6639.76
mean that i do it all the time it's just

6636.32 --> 6643.119
sometimes i'm like oh it's life

6639.76 --> 6645.1990000000005
and then just wait until they go in

6643.119 --> 6646.5599999999995
in that comfort zone where i think it's

6645.199 --> 6649.598999999999
all right

6646.56 --> 6651.52
to just say some really stupid things

6649.599 --> 6653.92
and then believe it and then just to get

6651.52 --> 6656.8
in there and just

6653.92 --> 6656.8
just correct it

6657.119 --> 6660.719
because it has a huge impact

6661.76 --> 6665.280000000001
it doesn't mean that i'm then gonna spam

6663.679 --> 6666.08
or anything because i don't end up

6665.28 --> 6669.28
getting banned

6666.08 --> 6672.88
you know they don't ban me

6669.28 --> 6672.88
this is very wise by the way

6679.04 --> 6683.679
pretender if you what am i a pretender a

6681.52 --> 6685.92
flat earther

6683.679 --> 6685.92
what

6686.96 --> 6694.0
or the thing is tara

6691.199 --> 6695.919999999999
when you are a ball or a flat earther

6694.0 --> 6699.36
and you're going in a ballers

6695.92 --> 6701.679
hangout chat they do

6699.36 --> 6703.759999999999
usually just consider you a troll for

6701.679 --> 6704.08
just asking the honest questions and all

6703.76 --> 6706.639
that

6704.08 --> 6709.84
the housekeeping situation they will

6706.639 --> 6709.84
call you a troll anyway

6711.44 --> 6715.36
because they think that the real globe

6713.84 --> 6717.92
believers think that everybo

6715.36 --> 6720.48
all flat earthers are trolls that's why

6717.92 --> 6721.119
they bring up the nonsense and regularly

6720.48 --> 6723.44
like

6721.119 --> 6725.28
they don't really believe the earth is

6723.44 --> 6728.799999999999
flat seriously because they

6725.28 --> 6729.679
really think that you know once you go

6728.8 --> 6731.84
over those

6729.679 --> 6734.639
obstacles of delusion and you think it's

6731.84 --> 6736.4800000000005
okay to make a fallacious argument

6734.639 --> 6738.2390000000005
then at some point yeah if you're that

6736.48 --> 6740.5599999999995
deluded then why not

6738.239 --> 6742.5599999999995
make yourself believe that actual flat

6740.56 --> 6743.92
earthers can't really exist it's just a

6742.56 --> 6745.76
giant troll joke

6743.92 --> 6747.679
you know if you're already tapping into

6745.76 --> 6751.119000000001
the illusion then why not

6747.679 --> 6753.599
convince yourself of that

6751.119 --> 6755.28
to just make it all right like oh no no

6753.599 --> 6756.719
the housekeeping question no it's just

6755.28 --> 6757.84
trolling because they don't really

6756.719 --> 6760.08
believe in the ball

6757.84 --> 6761.52
they're just they found these questions

6760.08 --> 6764.48
and then

6761.52 --> 6765.92
yeah yeah that that's very confusing and

6764.48 --> 6768.0
difficult

6765.92 --> 6769.28
to deal with but we have our answers

6768.0 --> 6771.119
even though they don't make any sense

6769.28 --> 6773.5199999999995
they're all fallacious

6771.119 --> 6775.598999999999
but then to just say no no they're they

6773.52 --> 6777.119000000001
don't really mean it

6775.599 --> 6780.88
they don't really think the earth is

6777.119 --> 6783.04
flat they're just trolling us with this

6780.88 --> 6785.1990000000005
and then if you think of it like that

6783.04 --> 6786.96
then it doesn't

6785.199 --> 6788.879999999999
it yeah you can take a little bit of

6786.96 --> 6789.679
distance because then it's just meant as

6788.88 --> 6791.84
a joke

6789.679 --> 6793.84
so you don't actually have to remember

6791.84 --> 6795.76
or really read into the details of what

6793.84 --> 6806.56
the flat earthers said

6795.76 --> 6821.84
you can just walk away much easier

6806.56 --> 6821.84
because i see it all the time

6822.49 --> 6826.95
[Music]

6831.92 --> 6838.279
[Music]

6841.55 --> 6844.649
[Music]

6868.639 --> 6874.84
what does that mean steamy travelers

6871.679 --> 6877.84
the most popular flat earthers might be

6874.84 --> 6877.84
posed

6878.719 --> 6882.08
or the legitimate

6883.36 --> 6886.4
what you think they are posers look if

6885.679 --> 6889.119
you're gonna go

6886.4 --> 6891.199
full in flat earth like that how can you

6889.119 --> 6893.92
pose

6891.199 --> 6897.759999999999
if you got winning arguments how can you

6893.92 --> 6900.96
it's like the most ridiculous thing ever

6897.76 --> 6902.96
like what uses it for an actual ball

6900.96 --> 6904.96
believer to

6902.96 --> 6906.88
basically get into the skin of

6904.96 --> 6910.08
everything that opposes the ball

6906.88 --> 6911.92
for real be a convincing flat earther

6910.08 --> 6913.76
and then literally oppose your own

6911.92 --> 6915.679
belief that makes no sense that's like a

6913.76 --> 6917.679
paradox

6915.679 --> 6919.84
psychological paradox that makes no

6917.679 --> 6919.84
sense

6922.32 --> 6926.5599999999995
it doesn't mean that if you're a flat

6924.08 --> 6929.44
earther you're all good

6926.56 --> 6930.719
right there's still plenty of dubious

6929.44 --> 6933.04
people out there

6930.719 --> 6933.76
that might believe the earth is flat and

6933.04 --> 6936.8
then just

6933.76 --> 6940.639
apply their dubious characteristics to

6936.8 --> 6942.400000000001
everything yeah

6940.639 --> 6944.08
just because you think the earth is flat

6942.4 --> 6947.36
doesn't make you perfect

6944.08 --> 6947.92
not even close it usually just brings

6947.36 --> 6949.839999999999
out more

6947.92 --> 6951.28
pressure on the individual so that they

6949.84 --> 6954.08
will

6951.28 --> 6956.159
show more of their weaknesses that

6954.08 --> 6958.88
naturally happens

6956.159 --> 6959.36
when you yeah when you open up as a flat

6958.88 --> 6960.639
earther

6959.36 --> 6963.598999999999
and then have to deal with all the

6960.639 --> 6966.639
trolls and the ballers

6963.599 --> 6972.159000000001
it will test you and it will reveal

6966.639 --> 6972.159000000001
your character but it doesn't mean that

6972.32 --> 6975.599
you can literally just pretend to be a

6974.639 --> 6977.4400000000005
flat earther

6975.599 --> 6979.360000000001
you might be able to do it but not for

6977.44 --> 6981.5199999999995
long there's people

6979.36 --> 6983.679
like jose that sort of tried it that

6981.52 --> 6985.360000000001
didn't last very long

6983.679 --> 6988.159
it's just months and after that they

6985.36 --> 6990.719
just can't handle it anymore

6988.159 --> 6991.28
because yeah if you're going to go along

6990.719 --> 6994.4800000000005
with

6991.28 --> 6997.119
things that literally dispel

6994.48 --> 6998.799999999999
not just oppose but dispel the things

6997.119 --> 7003.36
that you believe in and you

6998.8 --> 7006.88
repeat that that kind of breaks it

7003.36 --> 7010.96
it really hurts the feelings

7006.88 --> 7015.36
associated with the dreams integrity

7010.96 --> 7017.92
in the experience so you can't really

7015.36 --> 7021.36
be a fake flat earther that only a

7017.92 --> 7021.36
baller would believe that

7022.48 --> 7027.5199999999995
it's like okay baller you you believe

7024.32 --> 7029.04
we're we're fake flat earthers right

7027.52 --> 7030.88
or some of us that we don't really

7029.04 --> 7034.08
believe it okay why don't you

7030.88 --> 7035.76
try to convincingly act like a flat

7034.08 --> 7038.0
earther why don't you try that out

7035.76 --> 7039.599
see how well that fares for you see how

7038.0 --> 7043.04
come how convinced

7039.599 --> 7045.92
other flat earthers will be you know

7043.04 --> 7048.08
just make his new random account

7045.92 --> 7050.4
nobody's heard of

7048.08 --> 7052.159
and start out as a flat earther just to

7050.4 --> 7053.759999999999
see what it's like let's see how well

7052.159 --> 7055.839999999999
you do with that

7053.76 --> 7057.360000000001
yeah if you think it's so easy to

7055.84 --> 7059.52
pretend

7057.36 --> 7060.48
as a baller to be a flat earther good

7059.52 --> 7063.679
luck with that

7060.48 --> 7066.799999999999
now in reality it's actually a lot

7063.679 --> 7069.84
easier to pretend

7066.8 --> 7071.52
to be a baller when you're actually a

7069.84 --> 7073.84
flat earther

7071.52 --> 7075.92
yeah how ironic is that and i'm the

7073.84 --> 7078.400000000001
living proof of that because

7075.92 --> 7080.32
i act like a baller for the comedic

7078.4 --> 7083.598999999999
value a lot of

7080.32 --> 7084.799999999999
plenty of times over at the flat earth

7083.599 --> 7088.0
debate

7084.8 --> 7091.28
you know why because as a flat earther

7088.0 --> 7093.199
you know how the ball works really well

7091.28 --> 7095.599
and why it doesn't work

7093.199 --> 7098.08
and then you can choose to play around

7095.599 --> 7098.08
with that

7098.88 --> 7103.1990000000005
that's the difference it's much easier

7100.8 --> 7104.4800000000005
to be a flat earther and pretend to be a

7103.199 --> 7107.5199999999995
baller

7104.48 --> 7109.759999999999
really successfully so

7107.52 --> 7112.0
than to be an actual baller and

7109.76 --> 7115.84
pretending to be a flat earther

7112.0 --> 7115.84
which nobody's really gonna fall for

7116.96 --> 7122.2390000000005
so yeah that's uh

7122.56 --> 7126.4800000000005
it's not gonna work anyway i'm rounding

7124.4 --> 7127.04
