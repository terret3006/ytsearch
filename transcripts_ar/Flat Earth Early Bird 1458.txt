right Christmas days are coming

189.78 --> 192.56
foreign

199.2 --> 204.17999999999998
so yeah I I seem to be pretty much

201.659 --> 206.28
restored

204.18 --> 208.31900000000002
although yeah still

206.28 --> 210.0
but that happened like as it was getting

208.319 --> 213.29999999999998
a lot colder

210.0 --> 215.4
during Autumn just like standard

213.3 --> 217.519
a little bit more burden on the back and

215.4 --> 220.44
I'm kind of back to that

217.519 --> 222.42000000000002
that was kind yeah secretly I'm hoping

220.44 --> 224.4
for like a total full recovery but that

222.42 --> 227.33999999999997
doesn't really happen until

224.4 --> 232.519
like springtime

227.34 --> 232.519
so I'm just in Winter mode my body now

232.98 --> 239.159
that's all very doable right

236.76 --> 242.39999999999998
hello Supreme knowing first in chat good

239.159 --> 245.04
to see you stazz moratz good to see you

242.4 --> 247.58

249.18 --> 254.93900000000002
low Only the Lonely

251.99 --> 257.84000000000003
[Music]

254.939 --> 257.84
foreign

258.14 --> 265.74
[Music]

276.74 --> 281.12
so

278.52 --> 281.12
yeah

282.12 --> 287.639
I'm just taking it easy today don't have

285.54 --> 291.02000000000004
to go out

287.639 --> 291.02
but everything I need

300.24 --> 308.479
right well yesterday's Flat Earth

303.9 --> 308.479
debates was again very long

309.12 --> 313.81
was it though

311.46 --> 316.08
yeah

313.81 --> 318.6
[Music]

316.08 --> 321.25899999999996
so yeah there's a lot of development

318.6 --> 321.259
happening

321.84 --> 326.21
uh

322.84 --> 326.21
[Music]

341.52 --> 346.639
let's see what else yeah kiwi live also

346.68 --> 349.639
Jim Bob

349.68 --> 354.259
pretty much at the same time of course

355.02 --> 358.52
I followed a bit of both

361.86 --> 366.96000000000004
and yeah then after that like Nathan

364.68 --> 370.8
Oakley's premiere

366.96 --> 370.79999999999995
from show 1791

371.28 --> 375.19899999999996
man so many long shows now

376.86 --> 382.319
it's hard to keep track of it all

379.32 --> 383.4
right anyway eight fiber out it's good

382.319 --> 385.88
to see you

383.4 --> 385.88
thank you

386.23 --> 389.67900000000003
[Music]

394.65 --> 408.58
[Music]

422.64 --> 426.86
[Music]

428.18 --> 433.44
yeah

430.1 --> 435.12
all right I feel pretty good but I am a

433.44 --> 439.46
little bit

435.12 --> 439.46
sleepy still I don't know

440.52 --> 445.08
maybe it's just because my back's

442.56 --> 447.599
feeling so much better and then

445.08 --> 452.12
I feel like or my body feels like you

447.599 --> 452.12
got some catching up to do with sleeping

454.319 --> 461.03900000000004
because yeah in the last week I mean it

458.28 --> 462.0
worked it I managed to sleep but it is

461.039 --> 465.36
like

462.0 --> 467.46
trying to sleep when you're sick

465.36 --> 470.099
and then you yeah

467.46 --> 474.0
you get enough rest to basically restart

470.099 --> 476.34
but you don't really rest from it a lot

474.0 --> 478.919
so I think that's part of it

476.34 --> 480.81
I'm a little

478.919 --> 485.00899999999996
sleepy

480.81 --> 485.009
[Music]

489.259 --> 495.259
feels like a happy day already

492.66 --> 495.259
foreign

495.78 --> 498.44
Maybe

499.8 --> 504.259
means plenty of heavy things happening

512.059 --> 519.8199999999999
[Music]

542.6 --> 546.4200000000001
right anyway

544.43 --> 548.519
[Music]

546.42 --> 552.42
maybe it's because it is the shortest

548.519 --> 554.339
day of the year then I feel like this

552.42 --> 556.14
don't do a bowling Channel

554.339 --> 561.12
learn too much

556.14 --> 564.74
well it's not just that DJ deck 100 DJ

561.12 --> 564.74
one deck I mean

565.62 --> 571.5600000000001
I can do ball win

568.08 --> 573.72
because he's surrounded by

571.56 --> 577.68
Flat Earth disclaimers

573.72 --> 580.019
because of I basically encapsulate

577.68 --> 582.3
what he does

580.019 --> 585.92
preface it carefully

582.3 --> 589.8599999999999
if I do a full suspense

585.92 --> 594.019
Baldwin act that would actually be very

589.86 --> 594.019
bad for me for my health

595.019 --> 599.66
I've tried to communicate this to the

597.18 --> 602.16
guys but they just ignore it

599.66 --> 603.0899999999999
because they don't understand what that

602.16 --> 605.04
is

603.09 --> 609.4200000000001
[Music]

605.04 --> 613.279
it can be bowling in between those guys

609.42 --> 613.279
because they are there

613.62 --> 620.24
like they are there with their common

615.959 --> 620.2399999999999
sense as a Lifeline in that moment

623.7 --> 627.32
doesn't it drain you yeah

628.62 --> 634.5
I mean why do you think I'm what is like

631.74 --> 638.24
the longest time even on fed that I'm

634.5 --> 638.24
like in character as Baldwin

639.839 --> 644.72
I mean that is probably like one minute

642.3 --> 644.7199999999999
Max

645.12 --> 649.1
and it's usually all I need

650.04 --> 653.64
but after that I have to like Let It Go

652.14 --> 657.72
and it's like ah

653.64 --> 661.76
to let go again because it is

657.72 --> 661.76
it is kind of unnatural

661.86 --> 664.76
to do that

672.72 --> 676.339
15 minutes no

679.32 --> 683.49
I might hold on to like one point or

681.839 --> 686.0
something but that's not like

683.49 --> 690.0790000000001
[Music]

686.0 --> 690.079
that's not full Baldwin

692.76 --> 697.38
anyway I don't want to do it

695.82 --> 699.8000000000001
to me I'm comfortable even thinking

697.38 --> 699.8
about it

700.86 --> 703.94
like that's not how it works it just

703.079 --> 711.2399999999999
isn't I'm sorry

703.94 --> 711.24
[Music]

722.16 --> 726.81
foreign

723.91 --> 734.0
[Applause]

726.81 --> 737.5189999999999
[Music]

734.0 --> 740.72
even noticed but I've not really used a

737.519 --> 740.72
lot of Ballwin recently

741.42 --> 745.56
[Music]

743.04 --> 748.68
it works really easily when I have

745.56 --> 754.5189999999999
Access Energy like in the summer

748.68 --> 754.519
but it's just not really a winter thing

754.62 --> 760.62
also because when you do high energy

757.5 --> 762.839
stuff in the winter it usually draws in

760.62 --> 766.7
like aggression as well

762.839 --> 768.36
and that doesn't work at all with Bowen

766.7 --> 770.5790000000001
[Music]

768.36 --> 772.47
how do you think I feel writing my

770.579 --> 775.559
probes I don't know

772.47 --> 775.5590000000001
[Music]

777.18 --> 783.42
right but when you're writing a poem

779.88 --> 785.21
you're not held to task live on the spot

783.42 --> 786.42
it's different

785.21 --> 788.5790000000001
[Music]

786.42 --> 791.0
you can create it on your own pace

788.579 --> 791.0
without

791.459 --> 796.7399999999999
like

792.72 --> 799.5790000000001
having to invest a lot of energy in

796.74 --> 799.5790000000001
in acting

801.12 --> 804.38
you're just focusing

804.839 --> 810.37
letting it flow

807.24 --> 812.16
right but it still costs energy

810.37 --> 814.62
[Music]

812.16 --> 816.6
but it's like that's a that's a design

814.62 --> 820.82
that's designing something it's

816.6 --> 820.82
different from like live performing

822.48 --> 825.26
foreign

856.92 --> 859.579
this is

869.399 --> 872.6
what the hell

875.639 --> 879.26
hold on I'll be right back

890.339 --> 893.339
foreign

922.74 --> 925.74
foreign

942.24 --> 945.369
[Music]

947.519 --> 951.0600000000001
okay guys I don't feel very good right

950.279 --> 953.1
now

951.06 --> 955.0189999999999
it's probably because I got the back

953.1 --> 958.16
plate

955.019 --> 960.3
but I feel not good

958.16 --> 965.42
[Music]

960.3 --> 965.42
I think it's shower time and all that so

976.74 --> 981.839
so it's gonna be a short show today

979.279 --> 984.12
typical because it's the shortest day of

981.839 --> 985.44
the year

984.12 --> 987.72
thank you

985.44 --> 990.32
maybe I'll get on the Flat Earth debate

987.72 --> 990.32
after this

990.839 --> 994.6990000000001
but I need some recovery time

997.56 --> 1004.7589999999999
it's the 21st yes anyway

1002.3 --> 1007.579
thanks for coming everyone

1004.759 --> 1011.0600000000001
sorry it's been such a short show

1007.579 --> 1013.7199999999999
please don't forget the rogans it up

1011.06 --> 1013.7199999999999
and

1014.42 --> 1016.779
yeah

1017.24 --> 1022.76
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

1019.22 --> 1024.679
early bird number 1459

1022.76 --> 1026.9
[Music]

1024.679 --> 1028.8190000000002
Thursday

1026.9 --> 1032.299
I might join the Flat Earth debate after

1028.819 --> 1035.5
this over at Nathan Oakley 1980 Channel

1032.299 --> 1035.5
hope to see you there

1035.839 --> 1039.9099999999999
