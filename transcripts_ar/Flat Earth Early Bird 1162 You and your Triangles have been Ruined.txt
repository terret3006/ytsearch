you could stir still use it

82.159 --> 84.56
a lot

84.799 --> 89.04
right so yeah the weather today is

91.119 --> 97.439
it the storm's kind of back

93.6 --> 97.439
and it's raining a lot this time

98.84 --> 106.399
yeah big clouds up there rushing by

103.439 --> 106.39899999999999
very rapidly

110.24 --> 115.28
it's no more incredible ripping winds

113.2 --> 119.68
though

115.28 --> 119.68
my my chair managed to stay in one place

124.0 --> 128.119
right although yeah yesterday

128.8 --> 133.52
everything has like

130.56 --> 137.599
blown away from the roof like

133.52 --> 137.59900000000002
the uh bug house

139.52 --> 144.87900000000002
was suspended by a thread and it

142.08 --> 147.04000000000002
literally just ripped clean off

144.879 --> 148.72
very lucky it didn't blow off the entire

147.04 --> 151.2
building then it would probably have

148.72 --> 151.2
shattered

152.0 --> 157.28
and so did the water bowl

154.72 --> 158.879
and it luckily got stuck somewhere in

157.28 --> 160.72
the corner

158.879 --> 163.2
of the roof because

160.72 --> 165.68
yeah that could have very easily blown

163.2 --> 167.92
all the way into like the river

165.68 --> 167.92000000000002
so

168.4 --> 173.59900000000002
so i'm keeping those inside until this

170.8 --> 173.59900000000002
storm is over

174.72 --> 178.4
ah

176.56 --> 180.48
low stone monkey 3d

178.4 --> 185.519
i keep calling you 3d if you don't have

180.48 --> 187.76
the 3d anymore first in chat low nathan

185.519 --> 191.44
so you sent me a buck on paper yeah you

187.76 --> 194.39999999999998
did and that was very helpful

191.44 --> 197.2
unfortunately yeah

194.4 --> 199.68
i need more

197.2 --> 203.35999999999999
because i like to eat

199.68 --> 203.36
because that's really what i use it for

206.4 --> 211.12
right

208.64 --> 215.11999999999998
anyway

211.12 --> 215.12
yeah yesterday's show was was great

216.72 --> 221.599
it's very focused

219.44 --> 224.959
uh of course yeah the weather was kind

221.599 --> 228.48
of different so i i hope that i can do

224.959 --> 231.12
a similar type of job today

228.48 --> 234.23899999999998
and have a good rest

231.12 --> 236.08
finished watching that movie the natural

234.239 --> 237.68
and was really

236.08 --> 239.12
surprised by

237.68 --> 241.04000000000002
like

239.12 --> 243.20000000000002
the positive

241.04 --> 244.64
outcome of that

243.2 --> 247.76
it it was

244.64 --> 250.23899999999998
like really unexpected end because there

247.76 --> 252.319
were like this was some gravel grabbler

250.239 --> 253.92000000000002
situation

252.319 --> 256.56
was basically the second half of the

253.92 --> 258.479
movie was like grabbler situation they

256.56 --> 259.919
were trying to basically bribe him

258.479 --> 260.959
discourage him

259.919 --> 263.12
and

260.959 --> 267.12
it seemed in the end like he was gonna

263.12 --> 270.24
get killed not i'm not gonna spoil how

267.12 --> 271.68
but then he didn't and he basically just

270.24 --> 274.56
like

271.68 --> 278.08
freaking won everything

274.56 --> 279.44
and that was just awesome

278.08 --> 282.4
unexpected

279.44 --> 284.24
like i was surprised by that ending

282.4 --> 286.4
because it's like but this is a

284.24 --> 288.8
hollywood movie

286.4 --> 291.19899999999996
when that happened they always tend to

288.8 --> 293.44
die or more tear or something but that

291.199 --> 295.52000000000004
didn't happen and that was like really

293.44 --> 297.68
like whoa

295.52 --> 298.88
you're not going to do that

297.68 --> 302.16
huh

298.88 --> 302.15999999999997
who could have seen that coming

303.12 --> 307.44
you would have sent super chat

305.44 --> 311.12
but i prefer definitely because super

307.44 --> 315.039
chats don't actually do anything for me

311.12 --> 315.039
they don't end up in my pocket nathan

317.44 --> 321.759
mctoon's gotta tell yeah there's no way

322.0 --> 325.36
guys

323.36 --> 326.96000000000004
somebody's gonna lay down that amount of

325.36 --> 328.0
money

326.96 --> 330.56
that's

328.0 --> 331.919
that means they're of course they're not

330.56 --> 334.639
going to pay it

331.919 --> 336.88
there's no way in hell

334.639 --> 339.84000000000003
that would ever

336.88 --> 339.84
ever be transferred

342.24 --> 345.919
it's just a carrot on the stick it's

343.919 --> 347.84
just like david weiss you think david

345.919 --> 350.15999999999997
weiss is ever at some point going to

347.84 --> 351.52
give his bitcoin

350.16 --> 353.199
because somebody proved the earth

351.52 --> 355.52
supposedly was about it's it's all

353.199 --> 357.6
nonsense

355.52 --> 360.71999999999997
and mctoon's never gonna

357.6 --> 363.91900000000004
actually concede to the point that he

360.72 --> 366.319
will admit defeat and transfer 10 000

363.919 --> 369.59999999999997
it's just not gonna happen ever it's

366.319 --> 371.03900000000004
[ __ ] to think that could actually

369.6 --> 373.91900000000004
happen

371.039 --> 373.919
it never does

374.96 --> 378.96
you just fall you're just

378.08 --> 381.75899999999996
dude

378.96 --> 383.59999999999997
like yeah carrots on sticks that's cute

381.759 --> 387.759
yeah it's a carrot it's on the stick i'm

383.6 --> 387.759
not gonna chase that i'm not an idiot

388.479 --> 393.28
right i'd rather just dig my carrots out

390.8 --> 394.88
of the ground somewhere

393.28 --> 397.28
or grow my own

394.88 --> 397.28
anyway

397.96 --> 401.06
[Music]

401.68 --> 404.72
yeah nathan

405.28 --> 410.79999999999995
a little light before the tunnel

408.72 --> 413.03900000000004
mctoon is a fraud

410.8 --> 414.08
well he's an anti-flat earther and a

413.039 --> 415.599
liar

414.08 --> 418.08
but

415.599 --> 418.08
at it

418.639 --> 423.919
but he did send me that bible

422.0 --> 426.24
so i am thankful for that

423.919 --> 426.24
right

432.16 --> 437.03900000000004
but yeah there's no way he's ever gonna

433.919 --> 439.84
pay out ten thousand dollars never this

437.039 --> 439.84
is ridiculous

443.599 --> 446.8
right

445.12 --> 449.039
i mean

446.8 --> 451.12
the only people you could ever expect

449.039 --> 452.639
somebody

451.12 --> 454.8
the only people you could expect to

452.639 --> 458.16
actually pay out that kind of money for

454.8 --> 460.479
a challenge are ones that you before

458.16 --> 462.84000000000003
they set that challenge

460.479 --> 467.12
actually hand out that kind of

462.84 --> 467.11999999999995
money right probably

467.44 --> 472.56
then you know they that it's not that

470.4 --> 474.23999999999995
high threshold to them it's not a bluff

472.56 --> 476.479
it's not a carrot on a stick that they

474.24 --> 477.44
could actually dispense that

476.479 --> 480.4
right

477.44 --> 483.12
to just somebody just out of nowhere

480.4 --> 485.039
saying oh huge stack of money for a

483.12 --> 487.28000000000003
challenge it's just no way

485.039 --> 489.84
there's no way you should in your right

487.28 --> 492.479
mind expect them to pay that out

489.84 --> 494.56
unless it's a thing they do and they've

492.479 --> 497.599
already paid out

494.56 --> 499.52
probably not just saying they did

497.599 --> 501.199
right

499.52 --> 505.12
that's how you know okay that's an

501.199 --> 507.199
actual that could be an actual challenge

505.12 --> 509.52
because the guy can miss that kind of

507.199 --> 512.639
money or it has a smart business plan in

509.52 --> 512.639
what he's doing and that's

512.88 --> 517.12
and that's like yeah you could actually

514.959 --> 518.64
try it because he pays out it's already

517.12 --> 521.279
proven right

518.64 --> 524.0
well neptune doesn't have hasn't done

521.279 --> 527.519
anything like that so

524.0 --> 527.519
it's yeah it's a waste of time

528.48 --> 533.0
hey james mason adam price

534.08 --> 537.0400000000001
how are you doing nathan

542.08 --> 546.8000000000001
by the way i've noticed it's really

543.76 --> 549.6
funny baroplegic bear likes to hang

546.8 --> 553.12
around the flat earth debate now

549.6 --> 555.36
it's really funny because i just yeah

553.12 --> 557.04
like owen benjamin constantly references

555.36 --> 558.88
him

557.04 --> 562.64
in a very

558.88 --> 564.48
harsh but fair and hilarious way

562.64 --> 567.8389999999999
it's just really funny to see him hang

564.48 --> 567.839
around the flat earth debate now

568.48 --> 572.8000000000001
he's a bit of a goofy guy but he's kind

570.32 --> 572.8000000000001
of nice

573.6 --> 576.6
eh

588.88 --> 591.279
who yeah it's

590.32 --> 594.32
it's

591.279 --> 596.56
it's an owen benjamin follower

594.32 --> 599.279
that own benjamin likes to joke about a

596.56 --> 602.0799999999999
lot because he is in a wheelchair and he

599.279 --> 602.08
sells coffee

603.839 --> 608.0790000000001
apparently

605.44 --> 609.519
so oh benjamin has said to us many many

608.079 --> 613.1999999999999
times

609.519 --> 616.0
but it's called baroplegic bear

613.2 --> 618.24
with all caps by the way

616.0 --> 619.12
and i've seen him like in in your chat

618.24 --> 621.279
like

619.12 --> 622.8
three times now

621.279 --> 624.72
during your live show

622.8 --> 628.3599999999999
so i guess that he's like into a flat

624.72 --> 628.36
earth debate now

640.56 --> 645.8
this is i think this is how his name is

646.079 --> 650.3599999999999
spelled something like that

673.36 --> 677.519
i'd be surprised if somebody no

678.0 --> 681.04
you'd be surprised

682.24 --> 686.839
no you'd be misled because nobody can

685.68 --> 689.92
adam

686.839 --> 692.0790000000001
price the only reason you'd be surprised

689.92 --> 695.4399999999999
is because you were actually fooled in

692.079 --> 697.76
that moment for some reason

695.44 --> 700.32
that they did prove a globe

697.76 --> 702.48
that would be the surprise part

700.32 --> 706.0
but because it can't be real

702.48 --> 706.0
the globe can never be real

706.72 --> 711.36
sells coffee yeah yeah

709.04 --> 715.639
he's american though

711.36 --> 715.639
but he apparently sells coffee

727.92 --> 732.8
right i'd only i only know about this

730.639 --> 735.279
because owen benjamin has dissed on him

732.8 --> 737.1999999999999
like a lot of times

735.279 --> 739.279
and that's how i know bearplegix is in a

737.2 --> 742.9590000000001
wheelchair and he sells coffee

739.279 --> 744.8
i guess it was advertisement

742.959 --> 746.4799999999999
he's certainly he's a guy that knows how

744.8 --> 747.9799999999999
to take a punch

746.48 --> 749.6800000000001
like

747.98 --> 753.36
[Music]

749.68 --> 754.16
he's not afraid to be made fun of

753.36 --> 757.16
so

754.16 --> 757.16
whatever

760.639 --> 765.92
flat earthers are global leaders and

763.2 --> 768.0790000000001
censoring people oh my god

765.92 --> 771.079
yes we're the global leaders we're your

768.079 --> 771.079
leaders

775.519 --> 782.0
yeah flat earthers are the global

779.04 --> 785.5999999999999
leaders he's right you know

782.0 --> 787.2
we lead the globe we rule the globe

785.6 --> 789.44
believers

787.2 --> 792.9590000000001
because the globe

789.44 --> 794.639
is designed based on a flat plane

792.959 --> 796.959
you have to be a flat earther to

794.639 --> 799.12
understand that

796.959 --> 802.3199999999999
and when you do then you can

799.12 --> 804.32
lead the globers

802.32 --> 806.32
so yeah he's kind of right about that

804.32 --> 807.279
light before the tunnel flat earthers

806.32 --> 809.7600000000001
are

807.279 --> 813.399
global leaders

809.76 --> 813.399
we'd lead the globe

814.639 --> 819.6
right we're not censoring people though

817.04 --> 820.959
because we can't censor

819.6 --> 822.72
numpties

820.959 --> 824.88
from doing their own [ __ ] on their own

822.72 --> 828.639
channel

824.88 --> 832.639
right so that part's wrong

828.639 --> 835.92
we can only moderate our own channels

832.639 --> 838.399
right sensor actual censorship

835.92 --> 840.88
is getting in other people's business

838.399 --> 843.44
and stopping them from speaking

840.88 --> 845.8389999999999
that's censorship

843.44 --> 850.0400000000001
how are we censoring other people's

845.839 --> 850.0400000000001
channels we're not

858.88 --> 864.639
hey jeff gas head

861.839 --> 868.48
to oh no tinkerer

864.639 --> 872.24
omega genesis out there

868.48 --> 872.24
howard moore hmm

872.48 --> 876.32
is brenda really no

876.399 --> 882.839
no they're nothing alike

879.44 --> 885.519
no brenda is an unbearable

882.839 --> 887.12
sjw nutcase

885.519 --> 890.88
mactune

887.12 --> 891.92
is a bit of a pathological liar

890.88 --> 894.16
guy

891.92 --> 896.24
with gamma tendency that still tries to

894.16 --> 899.12
be a nice person

896.24 --> 902.0790000000001
kind of like earth math but

899.12 --> 904.8
less gross because flat earth math is

902.079 --> 905.92
really like a deranged liar

904.8 --> 908.16
who just

905.92 --> 910.3199999999999
never stops

908.16 --> 912.88
mctoon has like

910.32 --> 913.7600000000001
still has some traces of sensibility

912.88 --> 919.16
left

913.76 --> 919.16
in my opinion compared to flatter math

952.72 --> 957.9200000000001
hey look who's back and not banned

956.32 --> 959.279
right are you now

957.92 --> 961.04
a literally

959.279 --> 964.399
i hope you're not gonna use your

961.04 --> 967.36
presence in my chat today just to

964.399 --> 971.04
announce how i'm going to ban you right

967.36 --> 971.04
i hope you're not gonna do that again

971.44 --> 975.2790000000001
i think i made my point yesterday by not

973.92 --> 978.8
banning you

975.279 --> 980.56
by indulging your nuisance

978.8 --> 983.04
giving you a chance to actually have a

980.56 --> 984.7199999999999
conversation about something interesting

983.04 --> 987.92
i hope you're actually gonna take that

984.72 --> 987.9200000000001
opportunity this time

989.839 --> 993.1990000000001
no jose you're not new

994.48 --> 1000.9590000000001
unless new is an alternative description

998.24 --> 1002.399
for ignorant

1000.959 --> 1005.04
right

1002.399 --> 1006.56
oh it's new yeah because you don't pay

1005.04 --> 1008.079
attention

1006.56 --> 1011.8389999999999
because you forgot everything in a

1008.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
moment yeah then it's new

1036.839 --> 1044.1599999999999
it's see here here you go literally

1041.28 --> 1047.039
just prove my earlier statement

1044.16 --> 1049.6000000000001
flat earthers are

1047.039 --> 1052.0
your global leaders

1049.6 --> 1055.559
so thank you for properly addressing me

1052.0 --> 1055.559
there literally

1071.52 --> 1074.52
ah

1085.76 --> 1090.679
hey gadget inspector hi welcome back

1099.12 --> 1104.2399999999998
right oh by the way considering the

1101.44 --> 1106.16
great unbanning of the last in last

1104.24 --> 1107.679
month i think i figured out what

1106.16 --> 1109.3600000000001
happened earlier

1107.679 --> 1110.48
when i thought that i had unbanned

1109.36 --> 1112.4799999999998
everybody

1110.48 --> 1114.16
it seemed like

1112.48 --> 1116.96
like

1114.16 --> 1119.44
delete all didn't actually meet delete

1116.96 --> 1121.679
all in that list

1119.44 --> 1124.4
you'd still have to like scroll down and

1121.679 --> 1126.4
then show more and then do the same

1124.4 --> 1128.5590000000002
thing with that group

1126.4 --> 1130.96
so

1128.559 --> 1133.28
i thought i had unbanned everybody for a

1130.96 --> 1135.28
while before but i was wrong

1133.28 --> 1137.28
now everybody is actually unbanned

1135.28 --> 1141.6399999999999
except for those that have banned since

1137.28 --> 1141.6399999999999
which are mostly just stock accounts

1150.72 --> 1154.64
right apparently so getting inspected

1152.72 --> 1157.52
sorry it's just

1154.64 --> 1159.44
i i didn't pay enough attention in the

1157.52 --> 1162.72
editor

1159.44 --> 1164.4
i didn't notice sorry about that

1162.72 --> 1168.6000000000001
but now i figured that out so that i'm

1164.4 --> 1168.6000000000001
not going to make that mistake again

1197.76 --> 1200.76
so

1215.28 --> 1218.48
yeah american silver patriot hello by

1217.2 --> 1220.4
the way

1218.48 --> 1222.24
the end of the day helicentrism is the

1220.4 --> 1224.3200000000002
world's biggest religion that believes a

1222.24 --> 1226.24
straight line makes a circle

1224.32 --> 1229.6
yeah

1226.24 --> 1234.24
it's the worldwide religious religion of

1229.6 --> 1237.9599999999998
mathematical incompetence in favor of

1234.24 --> 1237.96
visual iconography

1249.919 --> 1255.76
appreciate oh wow you appreciate the

1252.32 --> 1257.84
unban okay howard moore fine

1255.76 --> 1260.799
i do remember in the time that i did ban

1257.84 --> 1263.52
you you were kind of acting deranged i

1260.799 --> 1265.84
might have been a little like

1263.52 --> 1269.9189999999999
more angry also

1265.84 --> 1272.3999999999999
but hey if you're appreciating it that's

1269.919 --> 1274.3200000000002
that's a good sign for me

1272.4 --> 1277.76
means that you might you might actually

1274.32 --> 1280.32
make a little effort this time

1277.76 --> 1281.919
right everybody gets a new chance after

1280.32 --> 1283.4399999999998
a while

1281.919 --> 1285.5200000000002
because

1283.44 --> 1287.679
most people are

1285.52 --> 1289.2
or go through phases where they are

1287.679 --> 1291.44
deranged

1289.2 --> 1294.72
myself included

1291.44 --> 1294.72
although not at this point

1299.039 --> 1303.6
right so people that

1301.28 --> 1306.0
like i don't even care even if you're a

1303.6 --> 1308.0
baller or not really

1306.0 --> 1310.159
i'm paying much more attention to your

1308.0 --> 1312.799
overall social behavior and like your

1310.159 --> 1315.5200000000002
inner turmoil how you deal with it

1312.799 --> 1318.48
that's much more in my focus than even

1315.52 --> 1320.24
what your philosophical convictions are

1318.48 --> 1322.24
because i have no problem with those

1320.24 --> 1324.32
philosophical convictions

1322.24 --> 1327.039
i can literally simulate the best of

1324.32 --> 1329.039
ballers whenever i need to i can teach a

1327.039 --> 1330.48
baller about the ball from a ball

1329.039 --> 1332.8799999999999
perspective

1330.48 --> 1336.24
i can do anything with it so it's not a

1332.88 --> 1339.0390000000002
threat to me at all like the entire

1336.24 --> 1341.6
cosmogeny situation is not a threat to

1339.039 --> 1344.559
me it doesn't even trigger me

1341.6 --> 1346.799
it's the behaviors

1344.559 --> 1348.32
that's the problem and it's a universal

1346.799 --> 1349.9189999999999
problem

1348.32 --> 1352.799
right it's almost like the flat earth

1349.919 --> 1355.8400000000001
versus the globe really exposes

1352.799 --> 1358.0
the inherent human nature problem that

1355.84 --> 1360.32
we're all dealing with

1358.0 --> 1362.4
that we have to deal with yeah and that

1360.32 --> 1365.52
means not just sit through it but

1362.4 --> 1368.0
actually figure out how to deal with it

1365.52 --> 1370.24
with ourselves and each other because

1368.0 --> 1372.72
it's a universal problem for humanity at

1370.24 --> 1375.28
this point it's expressing itself in

1372.72 --> 1378.32
many different ways

1375.28 --> 1380.24
in many different fields

1378.32 --> 1382.32
behavior is becoming a problem the

1380.24 --> 1385.1200000000001
internet has brought us closer to one

1382.32 --> 1386.08
another but by being closer to one

1385.12 --> 1389.36
another

1386.08 --> 1391.9189999999999
we've also been

1389.36 --> 1394.7199999999998
pushed closer to ourselves

1391.919 --> 1396.88
and people sometimes don't like to be

1394.72 --> 1400.76
that close to themselves and then they

1396.88 --> 1400.7600000000002
act out more

1403.679 --> 1407.2
i'll have to learn how to deal with it

1413.36 --> 1416.76
what are you doing

1423.039 --> 1426.64
nathan's on a rampage

1427.12 --> 1429.84
it's baldwinian

1428.799 --> 1433.36
what

1429.84 --> 1433.36
are you talking about adam price

1437.84 --> 1441.4399999999998
yeah i think that nathan is now trying

1439.76 --> 1443.6
to engage in

1441.44 --> 1447.52
explaining the arwanian paradox

1443.6 --> 1451.12
situation to the ballers which is

1447.52 --> 1451.12
kind of hopeless because

1451.52 --> 1456.72
that's one thing the ballers

1453.84 --> 1459.52
would never want to get

1456.72 --> 1461.82
it's like their last straw

1459.52 --> 1465.93
they're not gonna grab that last straw

1461.82 --> 1465.9299999999998
[Laughter]

1466.54 --> 1469.6399999999999
[Music]

1470.48 --> 1473.84
but it's good to remind everybody

1480.799 --> 1484.52
hey the other andrew

1492.0 --> 1498.0
stone monkey

1494.559 --> 1501.559
you're better than this stone monkey

1498.0 --> 1501.559
oh my god

1502.4 --> 1506.88
i didn't know you were still this

1504.64 --> 1508.64
deluded man

1506.88 --> 1511.88
come on

1508.64 --> 1511.88
come on

1516.08 --> 1522.559
tangent isn't refracted yeah black swan

1520.0 --> 1524.64
it's very simple

1522.559 --> 1527.76
yeah

1524.64 --> 1530.24
oh the the horizons it's refracted yeah

1527.76 --> 1531.2
you have no r value

1530.24 --> 1535.2
yeah

1531.2 --> 1537.6000000000001
even though what you use mathematically

1535.2 --> 1538.88
to ensure that the horizon isn't

1537.6 --> 1542.1589999999999
geometric

1538.88 --> 1544.7990000000002
requires r that you can no longer get

1542.159 --> 1547.1200000000001
because the horizon's refracted now and

1544.799 --> 1550.559
you needed that in order to establish

1547.12 --> 1552.2399999999998
the r value right oh oh so oh it's not

1550.559 --> 1553.76
refracted then

1552.24 --> 1555.1200000000001
because you don't have an oh yeah black

1553.76 --> 1557.279
swan

1555.12 --> 1561.279
we see too far

1557.279 --> 1564.0
the horizon isn't geometric after all

1561.279 --> 1566.24
even if it isn't refracted just because

1564.0 --> 1568.96
the horizon isn't refracted anymore

1566.24 --> 1570.64
because you don't have r doesn't mean

1568.96 --> 1574.08
that it's a ball

1570.64 --> 1576.3200000000002
the black swan still disproves the earth

1574.08 --> 1578.559
from being a ball

1576.32 --> 1580.8799999999999
there's nothing you can do

1578.559 --> 1583.6789999999999
there is absolutely

1580.88 --> 1587.3600000000001
nothing you can do

1583.679 --> 1588.88
the earth is not a ball it will never be

1587.36 --> 1591.1999999999998
a ball

1588.88 --> 1593.2
doesn't matter how much you twist and

1591.2 --> 1594.64
turn in your mind

1593.2 --> 1596.799
you can never

1594.64 --> 1599.3600000000001
actually accomplish

1596.799 --> 1601.279
that the earth is actually a ball it

1599.36 --> 1603.6
isn't

1601.279 --> 1607.24
it's a pipe dream it's a bald dream it's

1603.6 --> 1607.24
never going to be

1615.52 --> 1618.6299999999999
[Music]

1639.6 --> 1644.6399999999999
right well gadget inspector technically

1641.679 --> 1644.64
i've reasoned out

1644.799 --> 1648.799
that

1646.08 --> 1651.039
if the horizon was refracted

1648.799 --> 1653.039
which would mean you would have no

1651.039 --> 1655.44
radius data at all

1653.039 --> 1657.12
in order to have a model but

1655.44 --> 1660.3990000000001
whatever

1657.12 --> 1663.6
if the horizon was refracted then

1660.399 --> 1666.559
the apparent flatness that will result

1663.6 --> 1668.7199999999998
out of that would enable you to use a

1666.559 --> 1670.72
sextant because it only requires an

1668.72 --> 1672.96
optically

1670.72 --> 1676.48
it only requires an optically straight

1672.96 --> 1678.88
line it's a crazy it's not a geometric

1676.48 --> 1683.279
action anymore at that point

1678.88 --> 1686.48
but if it works out it works out right

1683.279 --> 1688.64
it's a practical tool

1686.48 --> 1691.1200000000001
and hey

1688.64 --> 1693.3600000000001
if it works it works right but it only

1691.12 --> 1695.6
works on a flat plane so if that means

1693.36 --> 1697.6
that you have to unwrap your ball using

1695.6 --> 1700.32
terrestrial refraction in order to get

1697.6 --> 1702.9599999999998
that flat plane fine

1700.32 --> 1705.2
but just realize that the earth cannot

1702.96 --> 1707.1200000000001
be proven to be a ball at that point

1705.2 --> 1708.799
because you can't establish a radius

1707.12 --> 1711.76
valve you don't even know where to get

1708.799 --> 1712.96
it you cannot prove a radius value

1711.76 --> 1716.1589999999999
anymore

1712.96 --> 1718.0
once you embrace terrestrial refraction

1716.159 --> 1720.24
for whatever purpose

1718.0 --> 1723.72
and that's it that's just you can't

1720.24 --> 1723.72
reverse that

1727.679 --> 1732.44
all right gage inspector thanks for

1729.12 --> 1732.4399999999998
popping by

1742.88 --> 1745.8400000000001
right because the problem with

1744.48 --> 1748.72
terrestrial

1745.84 --> 1748.72
refraction is

1749.039 --> 1754.08
is

1750.32 --> 1756.559
that even if like let's dig a really big

1754.08 --> 1759.4399999999998
let's give you all the presuppositions

1756.559 --> 1761.9189999999999
you want right all of it i can do that i

1759.44 --> 1762.96
can like literally give you every

1761.919 --> 1766.3990000000001
virtual

1762.96 --> 1770.08
incorrect aspect of the globe model and

1766.399 --> 1774.2399999999998
just isolate one little thing and still

1770.08 --> 1776.24
undo the entire thing every single time

1774.24 --> 1779.679
that's the unique thing about the bald

1776.24 --> 1780.799
earth it's the most disprovable

1779.679 --> 1783.039
thing

1780.799 --> 1784.48
humanity is ever created it's like it

1783.039 --> 1787.84
was meant

1784.48 --> 1790.159
to be explained and how it is wrong

1787.84 --> 1792.84
on every aspect that's the beautiful

1790.159 --> 1796.0
thing about it's a beautiful crazy

1792.84 --> 1800.1589999999999
thing it's ugly i guess but it's also

1796.0 --> 1800.159
beautiful that it is so dispellable

1800.399 --> 1804.2399999999998
right

1801.279 --> 1806.96
because even if we'd give you second law

1804.24 --> 1808.96
of thermodynamics violation outer space

1806.96 --> 1810.72
and gravity whatever that's supposed to

1808.96 --> 1813.679
be still keeping the gas to the ball and

1810.72 --> 1816.32
that there would be satellites up there

1813.679 --> 1818.3200000000002
very far away taking a photograph of

1816.32 --> 1820.8799999999999
earth right oh that's how you get the

1818.32 --> 1823.76
rate well guess what

1820.88 --> 1826.0800000000002
guess what

1823.76 --> 1830.0
terrestrial refraction

1826.08 --> 1833.4399999999998
is still going to warp that visual

1830.0 --> 1835.52
you still will not be able to establish

1833.44 --> 1837.6000000000001
a radius value even if you had a

1835.52 --> 1839.6
satellite in outer space taking a

1837.6 --> 1842.1589999999999
photograph from earth at a far distance

1839.6 --> 1844.9599999999998
the atmosphere

1842.159 --> 1848.3200000000002
having a terrestrial refraction effect

1844.96 --> 1851.039
would still make it unable for you to

1848.32 --> 1852.96
properly get the radius value of ball

1851.039 --> 1855.919
earth

1852.96 --> 1855.919
it never ends

1857.84 --> 1861.0
you see

1867.36 --> 1870.799
without refraction you wouldn't get our

1869.36 --> 1872.08
no it's the other way around the other

1870.799 --> 1876.0
andrew

1872.08 --> 1878.96
without r you wouldn't get refraction

1876.0 --> 1882.72
there's the r vel value is within the

1878.96 --> 1882.72
terrestrial refraction formula

1882.96 --> 1885.519
right

1884.559 --> 1888.1589999999999
but

1885.519 --> 1891.2
terrestrial refraction makes you unable

1888.159 --> 1893.7600000000002
to get that r value that it inherently

1891.2 --> 1894.72
uses

1893.76 --> 1896.8799999999999
because

1894.72 --> 1899.6000000000001
it was established the only way to

1896.88 --> 1900.88
establish the geometric radius value of

1899.6 --> 1904.08
earth

1900.88 --> 1906.0
is through visual measurement

1904.08 --> 1907.279
because the earth's too big to do it any

1906.0 --> 1910.24
other way

1907.279 --> 1912.48
well if it's then refracted you can't do

1910.24 --> 1916.559
that anymore

1912.48 --> 1920.48
it's self-defeating it's paradoxical

1916.559 --> 1923.36
it's the arwynian paradox i proudly

1920.48 --> 1923.3600000000001
discovered that

1923.44 --> 1928.44
that's why why it got my name

1937.44 --> 1944.24
the atmosphere is incredibly thin no

1940.24 --> 1944.24
no it's philby no it's not

1944.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
it's thick enough to actually bend light

1948.08 --> 1953.76
and unwrap it

1949.84 --> 1956.1589999999999
from a ball into an apparent flat plane

1953.76 --> 1958.72
doesn't matter how thin that is it's

1956.159 --> 1962.0
going to distort

1958.72 --> 1964.32
any visual measurement of the earth even

1962.0 --> 1967.6
at a massive distance

1964.32 --> 1969.9189999999999
it will make you unable to measure up

1967.6 --> 1973.519
the radius properly

1969.919 --> 1975.44
because any earthbound reading

1973.519 --> 1976.96
through that atmosphere is going to be

1975.44 --> 1979.1200000000001
distorted because of terrestrial

1976.96 --> 1981.76
refraction

1979.12 --> 1984.279
there is no more way to establish the

1981.76 --> 1987.12
radius even if you got the entire

1984.279 --> 1989.6
heliocentric universe

1987.12 --> 1991.6789999999999
if you accept terrestrial refraction you

1989.6 --> 1994.32
can no longer establish the radius

1991.679 --> 1996.3200000000002
pretty much no matter what you do

1994.32 --> 1998.399
no matter what you do because even

1996.32 --> 2001.519
terrestrial refraction applies beyond

1998.399 --> 2003.76
the visible spectrum of light right

2001.519 --> 2007.1200000000001
radar and all that also has to go around

2003.76 --> 2009.679
the curve and back yeah

2007.12 --> 2011.4399999999998
anything outside of the visual range

2009.679 --> 2017.88
well guess what

2011.44 --> 2017.88
that's what we use to measure things

2020.96 --> 2026.24
we measure things physical things

2024.64 --> 2028.3200000000002
through

2026.24 --> 2031.76
light

2028.32 --> 2033.6789999999999
and sub light like radar

2031.76 --> 2035.76
terrestrial refraction is going to apply

2033.679 --> 2038.24
you can no longer establish the radius

2035.76 --> 2040.96
no matter what you do

2038.24 --> 2042.88
no matter the level of technology no

2040.96 --> 2044.96
matter how much we give you of your

2042.88 --> 2047.44
globe earth model and outer space

2044.96 --> 2050.159
universe you will never be able to

2047.44 --> 2052.0
establish the radius anymore

2050.159 --> 2054.2400000000002
because you embrace the rest of

2052.0 --> 2056.079
refraction because of the black swan

2054.24 --> 2058.3199999999997
observations that makes the earth not a

2056.079 --> 2058.32
ball

2058.8 --> 2062.159
there's nothing you can do ballers

2060.72 --> 2065.1189999999997
there's nothing

2062.159 --> 2065.119
nothing you can do

2066.159 --> 2072.0
either you concede the black swan earth

2069.119 --> 2072.0
not being a ball

2073.04 --> 2080.24
or you can never have a radius value

2078.079 --> 2082.7200000000003
to use

2080.24 --> 2083.6789999999996
you can no longer establish it it would

2082.72 --> 2086.839
be a

2083.679 --> 2091.44
value the radius value that you

2086.839 --> 2091.44
accept but that you can never prove

2097.2 --> 2104.3199999999997
the error margin would be small no it

2100.0 --> 2107.28
wouldn't phil b no it wouldn't be small

2104.32 --> 2107.28
didn't you listen

2108.8 --> 2114.0
it unwraps an entire ball into a flat

2111.92 --> 2117.839
plane that's not

2114.0 --> 2117.839
small margin of error

2120.079 --> 2123.52
that's not small at all

2126.4 --> 2131.359
you want to establish an exact radius

2128.8 --> 2133.599
value you're going to have to be

2131.359 --> 2136.56
very

2133.599 --> 2136.56
very direct

2137.44 --> 2141.68
yeah

2138.32 --> 2144.7200000000003
terrestrial refraction unwarps

2141.68 --> 2146.72
visuals it literally makes it from

2144.72 --> 2149.1189999999997
spherical to flat

2146.72 --> 2151.2799999999997
there's no way that you can establish

2149.119 --> 2154.6400000000003
the radius value anymore at any distance

2151.28 --> 2156.079
it doesn't matter oh it's so small no it

2154.64 --> 2156.96
isn't small

2156.079 --> 2160.32
it's

2156.96 --> 2164.32
big enough to unwrap the visual of a

2160.32 --> 2166.8
ball into a flat plane that's not small

2164.32 --> 2166.8
phil b

2169.04 --> 2173.68
that's stupid little oh it's too far

2171.68 --> 2176.3999999999996
away it's too small it's too this to

2173.68 --> 2178.04
that no that tricky trick yeah that

2176.4 --> 2182.32
cheap ass

2178.04 --> 2184.64
astrophysicist trick is not gonna work

2182.32 --> 2186.56
it's not small

2184.64 --> 2189.1189999999997
it's massive it's massive enough

2186.56 --> 2191.119
terrestrial refraction is massive enough

2189.119 --> 2193.839
to unwrap

2191.119 --> 2197.28
spherical

2193.839 --> 2200.48
geometry into a perfectly flat plane

2197.28 --> 2202.2400000000002
that's not small that's massive

2200.48 --> 2204.4
and it's going to be massive at a

2202.24 --> 2207.1189999999997
distance as well

2204.4 --> 2208.8
the earth wouldn't even look like a ball

2207.119 --> 2210.7200000000003
from outer space i've been trying to

2208.8 --> 2214.52
tell you this before it wouldn't even

2210.72 --> 2214.52
look like a ball

2214.88 --> 2220.2400000000002
it would look more like a cone

2218.4 --> 2223.6800000000003
that you're looking at that straight it

2220.24 --> 2223.68
would be really weird

2227.2 --> 2233.52
like how do i compare this it's like

2230.56 --> 2235.92
yeah it might look like a ball up from

2233.52 --> 2237.359
dead on but after that it would be like

2235.92 --> 2239.599
a cone

2237.359 --> 2241.359
it would be really it wouldn't look even

2239.599 --> 2244.48
look like a ball if terrestrial

2241.359 --> 2244.48
refraction was real

2252.48 --> 2261.079
there's no oh my god

2256.72 --> 2261.0789999999997
oh my god look at that

2274.32 --> 2280.6400000000003
you're such an irredeemable boomer

2276.96 --> 2280.64
philby it's terrible

2282.32 --> 2288.1600000000003
you don't even take

2284.96 --> 2291.599
physics and that is you don't yeah it's

2288.16 --> 2294.8799999999997
just ignorance above all

2291.599 --> 2294.88
idiocy above all

2295.04 --> 2301.2799999999997
you're worshiping your own idiocy

2299.28 --> 2304.1600000000003
everything i explained is very

2301.28 --> 2306.079
legitimate that's exactly what it is

2304.16 --> 2308.0
it's how it's built it's how it's

2306.079 --> 2311.04
reasoned out

2308.0 --> 2314.0
you can't just say oh this is

2311.04 --> 2316.079
it's insignificant that's all just blah

2314.0 --> 2317.92
blah blah that's not based on any

2316.079 --> 2321.92
mechanical reality

2317.92 --> 2324.64
of the systems you accept

2321.92 --> 2326.7200000000003
it's just not true it's an excuse it's

2324.64 --> 2330.0
an excuse to get away it doesn't

2326.72 --> 2330.0
actually fix anything

2335.359 --> 2341.839
reflection refraction on flat earth

2337.76 --> 2341.8390000000004
would make it look concave right

2345.599 --> 2349.2000000000003
maybe

2346.72 --> 2351.4399999999996
but there is no terrestrial refraction

2349.2 --> 2353.68
on flat earth terrestrial refraction is

2351.44 --> 2356.48
a fictional invention

2353.68 --> 2358.3999999999996
based it just created to justify why the

2356.48 --> 2361.599
earth doesn't actually abide by

2358.4 --> 2361.599
spherical geometry

2362.56 --> 2368.32
by presupposing this spherical geometry

2365.76 --> 2370.0
and then correcting for it within the

2368.32 --> 2373.6400000000003
formula that's what terrestrial

2370.0 --> 2373.64
refraction is

2410.4 --> 2414.4
yeah right back

2412.0 --> 2414.4
it is

2415.119 --> 2417.6800000000003
okay

2419.68 --> 2423.48
nathan's on a rampage

2435.28 --> 2442.0
ah come on seeking star wars

2439.04 --> 2442.0
that's a little harsh

2442.72 --> 2448.2
he's just being a doubling down all

2445.2 --> 2448.2
boomer

2453.2 --> 2457.839
he only really responds like that when

2455.359 --> 2460.72
we confront him with facts

2457.839 --> 2460.72
that he doesn't like

2461.359 --> 2466.88
like on my show like he doesn't like get

2464.4 --> 2469.52
in my face about oh flat earthers are

2466.88 --> 2471.359
wrong but no phil b is actually been

2469.52 --> 2474.16
pretty nice but yeah when you push him

2471.359 --> 2477.359
in the corner he will be

2474.16 --> 2480.68
just another ball wizard in denial

2477.359 --> 2480.68
very boomerish

2494.319 --> 2498.96
okay take it easy there nathan

2496.72 --> 2498.9599999999996
uh

2501.52 --> 2506.119
all dog getting whipped yeah

2515.599 --> 2518.599
so

2526.72 --> 2530.5989999999997
ah i knew it

2548.48 --> 2553.2
oh come on nathan that's that's just

2550.96 --> 2553.2
mean

2557.28 --> 2564.44
there's a lot worse people out there

2559.359 --> 2564.44
that deserve that kind of talk too right

2577.52 --> 2580.24
what the [ __ ]

2584.079 --> 2586.319
uh

2589.52 --> 2593.839
hey akuma virus oh goody

2641.52 --> 2647.04
right so anyway

2643.52 --> 2650.64
anybody wants to support me

2647.04 --> 2653.119
i could still damn well use it i kind of

2650.64 --> 2654.56
am in a dead situation and i've been

2653.119 --> 2657.6800000000003
really

2654.56 --> 2657.68
wise with my money

2657.92 --> 2662.64
in the last month

2660.319 --> 2663.599
but yeah unfortunately that that's all

2662.64 --> 2666.72
the

2663.599 --> 2668.7000000000003
hey nathan gave me a euro

2666.72 --> 2671.9889999999996
thank you for that

2668.7 --> 2671.989
[Music]

2676.8 --> 2683.28
all right but i've always honored

2681.04 --> 2685.92
favors

2683.28 --> 2689.119
i mean technically it is just true

2685.92 --> 2692.64
whether i think it's honest or good or

2689.119 --> 2695.52
not if you do actually pay me and help

2692.64 --> 2697.92
me get around i will honor that

2695.52 --> 2699.2
doesn't mean i'm gonna give you a like a

2697.92 --> 2702.0
standard

2699.2 --> 2705.839
free waiver for terrible behavior

2702.0 --> 2705.839
although yeah with nathan it's

2706.4 --> 2710.64
i don't really know what to do to stop

2708.4 --> 2711.839
him it's when he's like

2710.64 --> 2716.5989999999997
going

2711.839 --> 2716.599
overboard it's just it's what he does

2724.88 --> 2732.319
ah philby

2727.599 --> 2735.599
your heaven is a ball isn't it

2732.319 --> 2735.599
that's freaking hilarious

2738.079 --> 2741.2000000000003
you realize that

2739.76 --> 2743.2000000000003
technically

2741.2 --> 2745.4399999999996
the ball

2743.2 --> 2748.7999999999997
earth cosmology

2745.44 --> 2748.8
is not compatible

2749.04 --> 2751.52
with god

2750.319 --> 2753.359
actually

2751.52 --> 2757.28
i mean it's been kind of like

2753.359 --> 2758.72
frankenstein fused now

2757.28 --> 2761.28
popularly

2758.72 --> 2764.0789999999997
especially in america they try to fuse

2761.28 --> 2765.3590000000004
the ball earth cosmology with god and

2764.079 --> 2768.52
creation

2765.359 --> 2772.0789999999997
but it doesn't actually fit it's a

2768.52 --> 2772.079
frankenstein merger

2774.4 --> 2780.7200000000003
one is a complete lie

2777.839 --> 2784.88
god doesn't actually exist in that

2780.72 --> 2787.359
it's all designed to avoid that

2784.88 --> 2790.1600000000003
and the other one yeah well

2787.359 --> 2793.2
everything what is is

2790.16 --> 2797.7599999999998
and the earth is in the ball it's flat

2793.2 --> 2797.7599999999998
it's stationary it's enclosed

2798.24 --> 2804.7999999999997
there's entropy there's a designer

2802.319 --> 2807.7599999999998
we're all degenerating over the

2804.8 --> 2810.2400000000002
generations through our sin and through

2807.76 --> 2810.2400000000002
nature

2810.96 --> 2818.16
but we are given incredible inherent

2815.2 --> 2820.7999999999997
power a glimpse of god

2818.16 --> 2820.7999999999997
from birth

2822.16 --> 2827.52
that we start out not really yeah just

2825.2 --> 2827.52
being

2827.76 --> 2832.6400000000003
you start out like incredibly wise but

2830.079 --> 2835.119
incapable then you grow up you lose your

2832.64 --> 2838.319
wisdom you become more capable and if

2835.119 --> 2839.76
you're lucky then you end up

2838.319 --> 2842.0
being

2839.76 --> 2844.8
still very capable with the physical

2842.0 --> 2847.92
less capable situation that you have as

2844.8 --> 2849.92
you grew older but regaining

2847.92 --> 2851.76
the old wisdom

2849.92 --> 2854.48
and if you don't

2851.76 --> 2857.88
then you turn into a demented old freak

2854.48 --> 2857.88
an old coot

2858.48 --> 2860.16
right

2859.28 --> 2863.0400000000004
but

2860.16 --> 2865.2
god isn't really compatible

2863.04 --> 2867.52
with the ball earth unless that god is

2865.2 --> 2869.7599999999998
satan that basically just

2867.52 --> 2872.8
is allowed to do whatever

2869.76 --> 2874.4
create things that make no sense

2872.8 --> 2877.2000000000003
right because everything that god

2874.4 --> 2880.2400000000002
designed makes sense that is the entire

2877.2 --> 2885.319
point is that he it has designed it all

2880.24 --> 2885.319
uniformly throughout time

2886.4 --> 2891.6800000000003
he designed it to make sense so you

2889.119 --> 2893.92
can't just say oh god did it because it

2891.68 --> 2898.0789999999997
doesn't make sense no

2893.92 --> 2898.079
that's the devil that's a lie

2898.24 --> 2903.359
god doesn't design things that make no

2900.96 --> 2905.68
sense he designed everything to make

2903.359 --> 2907.359
sense

2905.68 --> 2908.8799999999997
it's our own

2907.359 --> 2911.2799999999997
unwillingness

2908.88 --> 2914.839
that allows us to accept things that do

2911.28 --> 2914.8390000000004
not make sense

2915.44 --> 2920.16
to overlook

2917.68 --> 2923.72
what makes sense in favor of what does

2920.16 --> 2923.72
not make sense

2928.0 --> 2933.68
is that just from christianity no

2930.72 --> 2936.5589999999997
no i'm referring not to any specific

2933.68 --> 2939.68
religion just to god

2936.559 --> 2943.48
the designer like it's a religious

2939.68 --> 2943.48
it's just a fact

2945.04 --> 2949.52
it's intuitive

2947.04 --> 2954.0
it's logical

2949.52 --> 2954.0
it's not based on a religious tradition

2954.48 --> 2960.16
but i l i lend things details

2958.8 --> 2962.96
wisdom

2960.16 --> 2964.96
from everything

2962.96 --> 2969.8
whatever i come across and i recognize

2964.96 --> 2969.8
the wisdom i will assimilate that

2974.559 --> 2978.48
hey thank you

2976.48 --> 2979.68
america silver patriot

2978.48 --> 2984.68
for the

2979.68 --> 2984.68
199 super chat game over yeah

2984.8 --> 2989.44
i don't think god cares what shape you

2986.8 --> 2991.92
think earth is

2989.44 --> 2994.88
uh well i don't think that

2991.92 --> 2994.88
i think you're right

2995.28 --> 3001.599
but god does care whether you are right

2998.96 --> 3001.599
or wrong

3002.4 --> 3005.839
he doesn't

3004.0 --> 3007.44
like the design

3005.839 --> 3009.359
is there right god

3007.44 --> 3012.2400000000002
does very little

3009.359 --> 3015.04
he designed everything to do everything

3012.24 --> 3017.359
for him you see

3015.04 --> 3020.88
i don't think god really has even that

3017.359 --> 3022.88
much much interaction for real i think

3020.88 --> 3025.52
he really only enters in when

3022.88 --> 3027.6800000000003
everything's absolutely gone to [ __ ] and

3025.52 --> 3030.16
like everything is set in a way that

3027.68 --> 3031.7599999999998
cannot be unset that's when god actually

3030.16 --> 3035.2
steps in

3031.76 --> 3037.28
all those things that people pray to god

3035.2 --> 3040.72
that's

3037.28 --> 3042.559
all part of the design

3040.72 --> 3044.72
when they think they

3042.559 --> 3047.52
pray to god they don't actually pray to

3044.72 --> 3050.0789999999997
god they pray to like a

3047.52 --> 3053.119
an effect that is there

3050.079 --> 3055.119
designed by god to be there

3053.119 --> 3057.599
as like a spokesperson as like a

3055.119 --> 3061.359
diplomat for god you don't actually just

3057.599 --> 3064.76
get to directly contact god

3061.359 --> 3064.7599999999998
in my opinion

3070.64 --> 3074.64
and technically you wouldn't need to

3075.92 --> 3081.359
hey thank you jd for the 899

3078.88 --> 3083.839
pound super chat donation though if you

3081.359 --> 3085.839
really want to support my show i pre

3083.839 --> 3088.0
please tell me

3085.839 --> 3090.0789999999997
that you're donating through paypal

3088.0 --> 3091.68
announce it and then i i know it's there

3090.079 --> 3093.04
i don't get some notification or

3091.68 --> 3095.359
anything

3093.04 --> 3097.119
but yeah i can definitely use paypal

3095.359 --> 3098.88
support

3097.119 --> 3100.88
if you really like what i'm doing and if

3098.88 --> 3103.92
you like nathan

3100.88 --> 3103.92
going off in chat

3108.4 --> 3111.839
but thank you for the super chat

3125.2 --> 3131.04
a deist

3127.68 --> 3134.319
and i vaguely heard about deism it is

3131.04 --> 3135.68
i might be dazed adjacent as well

3134.319 --> 3140.8
it's just that

3135.68 --> 3143.5989999999997
i'll assimilate wisdom from everything

3140.8 --> 3144.7200000000003
like even things that have bad

3143.599 --> 3146.8
traits

3144.72 --> 3150.8799999999997
alongside them

3146.8 --> 3155.3590000000004
i will literally just surgically

3150.88 --> 3155.359
assimilate very specific details

3156.0 --> 3161.92
it's just i yeah

3158.0 --> 3161.92
i can do that i am doing that

3163.04 --> 3168.48
right and that's also why i pretty much

3165.44 --> 3171.04
say every religion has its wisdom

3168.48 --> 3173.44
unfortunately every religion also has

3171.04 --> 3175.839
its traps and its type of religious

3173.44 --> 3180.44
fanatics that come out of it

3175.839 --> 3180.44
and that can be abused by the beast

3232.559 --> 3235.559
hmm

3236.24 --> 3240.24
you did rick back well just try again

3238.24 --> 3242.319
later i guess

3240.24 --> 3244.8799999999997
look the issue is that if you're going

3242.319 --> 3246.64
to be on the after show nathan cuts a

3244.88 --> 3249.28
lot

3246.64 --> 3252.0
right if you want to guarantee being

3249.28 --> 3256.3190000000004
there then you'll just have to join

3252.0 --> 3256.319
during the live show because that's life

3258.24 --> 3262.24
right

3259.68 --> 3263.9199999999996
it's also for me

3262.24 --> 3265.7599999999998
the best moment to basically sneak

3263.92 --> 3268.16
attack with data

3265.76 --> 3271.1600000000003
knowing that nathan can't cut it out

3268.16 --> 3271.16
uh-huh

3281.28 --> 3286.3190000000004
ah come on howard moore

3284.4 --> 3289.599
you don't like it anymore you feel like

3286.319 --> 3289.599
you're being bullied now

3289.76 --> 3292.76
sheesh

3312.48 --> 3316.0
well nathan you don't know that

3316.96 --> 3320.64
it's actually

3318.559 --> 3323.599
you might be surprised that it's usually

3320.64 --> 3326.799
the other way around if a dad's really

3323.599 --> 3329.28
cowardice then usually their son

3326.799 --> 3332.16
especially if it's just one

3329.28 --> 3335.8390000000004
they usually tend to contrast with that

3332.16 --> 3335.839
become extra brave

3337.2 --> 3342.0789999999997
right

3338.96 --> 3342.079
so you don't know

3343.52 --> 3346.48
maybe

3345.52 --> 3352.24
you

3346.48 --> 3352.2400000000002
yeah maybe his son reminds him of you

3353.119 --> 3357.599
you ever considered that nathan

3355.52 --> 3362.68
i mean he is 70.

3357.599 --> 3362.6800000000003
you are kind of probably his son's age

3367.839 --> 3372.0789999999997
was

3369.76 --> 3372.079
oh

3372.96 --> 3375.96
damn

3376.64 --> 3380.8799999999997
okay this is all getting really personal

3378.64 --> 3380.8799999999997
now

3384.96 --> 3390.96
nathan

3386.799 --> 3392.0
you might want to put a cork in it now

3390.96 --> 3395.76
nathan

3392.0 --> 3395.76
you better put a cork in it right now

3402.079 --> 3405.8390000000004
or i'm gonna time you out nathan

3421.04 --> 3426.04
i'm sorry but you gotta stop

3433.2 --> 3438.24
it was fun while it lasted but this just

3435.76 --> 3443.6400000000003
got really bitter and i don't want you

3438.24 --> 3443.64
to continue doing that i'm sorry nathan

3446.799 --> 3452.24
yeah don't compliment me phil b you're

3449.04 --> 3454.4
being a total numpty

3452.24 --> 3457.359
so nathan was definitely correct but

3454.4 --> 3459.119
then you had to drag in your your dead

3457.359 --> 3461.2799999999997
son in there

3459.119 --> 3462.6400000000003
that's a really that's that's gross

3461.28 --> 3463.52
though but

3462.64 --> 3464.799
yeah

3463.52 --> 3469.119
nathan

3464.799 --> 3469.119
didn't actually listen he did look

3469.359 --> 3472.359
so

3480.96 --> 3486.04
it is kind of a low blow though philby

3490.17 --> 3493.2690000000002
[Music]

3494.16 --> 3497.16
so

3503.2 --> 3507.359
i know rufus

3504.88 --> 3507.359
i know

3512.96 --> 3517.04
but i don't think that nathan knew about

3515.04 --> 3518.72
his son so

3517.04 --> 3520.88
this just

3518.72 --> 3524.1189999999997
yeah that's when the conversation needs

3520.88 --> 3524.119
to end

3536.799 --> 3541.119
it doesn't matter whether phil brought

3538.799 --> 3542.96
it up first or nathan

3541.119 --> 3545.839
it's just that's where the conversation

3542.96 --> 3545.839
just needs to end

3548.39 --> 3551.5299999999997
[Music]

3574.96 --> 3579.599
yeah exactly i'm sorry hear that phil

3583.2 --> 3588.0789999999997
that's terrible it doesn't really matter

3585.92 --> 3591.319
what even the cause or anything was it's

3588.079 --> 3591.319
just terrible

3618.24 --> 3624.24
no no it doesn't serve as day that's

3622.0 --> 3626.319
it's out of whack

3624.24 --> 3628.24
at some point it doesn't matter anymore

3626.319 --> 3630.24
right the situation was revealed and

3628.24 --> 3633.2799999999997
that's when this conversation had to end

3630.24 --> 3635.4399999999996
before that part nathan was completely

3633.28 --> 3638.559
demolishing him

3635.44 --> 3640.48
and he then it had to become personal on

3638.559 --> 3642.48
a very deep level that's when it has to

3640.48 --> 3644.48
end

3642.48 --> 3647.2
so it's not relevant

3644.48 --> 3650.88
who brought it up first

3647.2 --> 3650.8799999999997
what is relevant is how it ended

3651.2 --> 3655.52
and that's where the conversation had to

3653.2 --> 3657.4399999999996
stop where nathan had to basically be

3655.52 --> 3658.559
put in the timeline i don't like doing

3657.44 --> 3661.119
that

3658.559 --> 3663.6800000000003
but i don't i don't think he actually

3661.119 --> 3666.6800000000003
noticed so i just had to kind of stopped

3663.68 --> 3666.68
it

3675.359 --> 3681.839
wow service day you regularly comment in

3678.4 --> 3681.839
places where you are banned

3682.4 --> 3685.4
huh

3697.52 --> 3700.559
oh bowly cats

3705.68 --> 3712.9199999999996
or two family members that have passed

3709.44 --> 3712.92
to do with that

3713.359 --> 3718.4
well it's very simple mega genesis if

3715.52 --> 3718.4
somebody's just

3719.599 --> 3723.2000000000003
lost

3720.72 --> 3726.8799999999997
like do you even know what it is like to

3723.2 --> 3732.24
lose your own kid i don't

3726.88 --> 3734.2400000000002
i've seen my grandmother lose my mother

3732.24 --> 3735.4399999999996
yeah

3734.24 --> 3739.799
it's like

3735.44 --> 3739.799
you don't just squabble

3740.16 --> 3744.8799999999997
you don't you just don't do that it's

3742.24 --> 3744.8799999999997
very simple

3747.839 --> 3753.2799999999997
it's it's really painful it it

3751.2 --> 3755.4399999999996
doesn't matter how idiotic the

3753.28 --> 3758.6400000000003
individual is

3755.44 --> 3759.839
it just requires just a little

3758.64 --> 3763.16
respect

3759.839 --> 3763.16
that's it

3789.2 --> 3793.8799999999997
what are you talking about wildcats

3814.96 --> 3818.96
no

3816.559 --> 3820.6400000000003
but i don't even know what

3818.96 --> 3824.52
like

3820.64 --> 3824.52
what does that even mean

3828.72 --> 3833.5989999999997
now i'm not gonna pay for anything

3831.2 --> 3834.8799999999997
except food and maybe some smokes and

3833.599 --> 3837.44
that's it

3834.88 --> 3839.52
for a while

3837.44 --> 3843.68
even though i'd love to pay for new

3839.52 --> 3843.68
shoes a new jacket a new chair

3847.44 --> 3852.7200000000003
right

3849.76 --> 3854.88
new pants like actually completely new

3852.72 --> 3857.68
pants would be great instead of just

3854.88 --> 3860.079
patching up these more than 10 year old

3857.68 --> 3860.0789999999997
pants

3863.68 --> 3868.64
but yeah i can't really do that unless

3865.52 --> 3872.52
somebody supports me through the paypal

3868.64 --> 3872.52
so please do so

3881.119 --> 3886.079
by the way i've heard of this gifts and

3884.319 --> 3887.839
gifts and go

3886.079 --> 3891.28
thing which is like an alternative to

3887.839 --> 3891.2799999999997
paypal is that any good

3891.68 --> 3896.16
because i like paypal because it is

3893.839 --> 3898.319
really international

3896.16 --> 3900.96
and it works very smoothly

3898.319 --> 3902.16
it's very effective for me but maybe

3900.96 --> 3904.079
like other

3902.16 --> 3906.3999999999996
types of

3904.079 --> 3909.44
systems would work as well like gifts

3906.4 --> 3911.28
and go

3909.44 --> 3914.079
unless like literally nobody's ever

3911.28 --> 3914.079
heard of that here

3917.52 --> 3921.2
so i might add that to the list of ways

3919.52 --> 3923.119
to donate

3921.2 --> 3927.24
because i don't know some people have

3923.119 --> 3927.2400000000002
trouble with paypal i think

3954.96 --> 3960.52
get money from

3956.24 --> 3960.52
cameo what's that

3994.079 --> 3996.4
ah

3997.68 --> 4002.24
they pay you to say st oh god no no

4004.24 --> 4007.24
no

4012.88 --> 4017.44
i mean yeah that's just they're just

4015.039 --> 4019.76
gonna make me try to savor it it would

4017.44 --> 4021.599
end up me basically selling my services

4019.76 --> 4024.2400000000002
as a clown

4021.599 --> 4028.1600000000003
i'm not gonna do that

4024.24 --> 4029.4399999999996
i'm just gonna say what i say and then

4028.16 --> 4032.799
hopefully

4029.44 --> 4032.799
people will be happy with it

4033.119 --> 4036.4
and donate to my paypal

4041.039 --> 4044.079
you can always ask me a question and

4043.039 --> 4047.559
then

4044.079 --> 4047.559
i may answer

4049.839 --> 4054.799
what's up with the deleted nathan okay i

4051.92 --> 4055.599
timed him out dr utker it was he was

4054.799 --> 4057.68
like

4055.599 --> 4059.6800000000003
overstepping a boundary that i thought

4057.68 --> 4061.359
he was probably going to be sorry about

4059.68 --> 4062.48
afterward

4061.359 --> 4066.2799999999997
and

4062.48 --> 4066.28
i took responsibility

4079.76 --> 4083.76
yeah nathan got timed out that's right

4084.96 --> 4090.0
i mean it's the least i can do for him

4087.359 --> 4093.7599999999998
constantly yelling at me every time i

4090.0 --> 4093.76
try to say something during the show

4094.96 --> 4100.0
the few times that i do

4097.359 --> 4102.08
when kiwi is constantly yelling over

4100.0 --> 4103.359
people muting them telling them to shut

4102.08 --> 4104.88
the [ __ ] up

4103.359 --> 4106.719
in the middle of a conversation and

4104.88 --> 4109.12
nathan doesn't say anything about that

4106.719 --> 4111.44
yeah then i think i can damn well time

4109.12 --> 4113.5199999999995
him out in my own chat

4111.44 --> 4116.5199999999995
if i think he's going too far

4113.52 --> 4116.52
yeah

4127.92 --> 4133.279
even though yeah nathan was

4131.279 --> 4135.1990000000005
he was winning

4133.279 --> 4137.1990000000005
right he won the argument that's

4135.199 --> 4140.639999999999
blatantly obvious by now

4137.199 --> 4142.159
he absolutely crushed him but then

4140.64 --> 4144.400000000001
yeah

4142.159 --> 4147.5199999999995
he did what he would typically do on his

4144.4 --> 4148.96
own live show

4147.52 --> 4150.0
and

4148.96 --> 4154.08
yeah

4150.0 --> 4157.199
it was it was getting a bit disruptive

4154.08 --> 4157.199
after basically

4158.159 --> 4162.159
phil b

4159.359 --> 4165.279
shared how his son has died and then

4162.159 --> 4167.679
nathan's kept basically ranting on about

4165.279 --> 4170.080000000001
his son and that's just like that's

4167.679 --> 4172.0
terrible i don't know if he real if he

4170.08 --> 4174.08
read it right he didn't seem to be

4172.0 --> 4176.239
listening either to the show he was just

4174.08 --> 4178.159
typing and typing and typing

4176.239 --> 4181.12
so i think he might have gotten a little

4178.159 --> 4181.12
bit carried away

4186.839 --> 4194.759
huh did he keep saying you need r for

4189.92 --> 4194.759
that among other body cats

4206.719 --> 4213.199
nathan can be scummy [ __ ] back well

4210.56 --> 4216.64
he isn't naturally like that

4213.199 --> 4220.639999999999
but yeah as he tries to explain when he

4216.64 --> 4221.679
he really hates liars

4220.64 --> 4224.88
like

4221.679 --> 4227.12
when people lie to themselves and to him

4224.88 --> 4228.88
about something in plain sight that

4227.12 --> 4230.88
brings out the worst in him he's

4228.88 --> 4232.08
explained that many times and i do get

4230.88 --> 4234.96
that

4232.08 --> 4237.199
but it does kind of like blindside him a

4234.96 --> 4237.199
little

4237.36 --> 4243.159
when that happens

4239.36 --> 4243.159
especially in chats

4259.84 --> 4265.1990000000005
yeah

4261.36 --> 4265.199
yeah it's it's fine you know

4266.0 --> 4269.48
it's so good

4275.6 --> 4280.4800000000005
no i'm not going to say that bully cats

4277.76 --> 4283.8
not unless you donate at least 20 euros

4280.48 --> 4283.799999999999
to my paypal

4306.0 --> 4312.56
the rate is 5k

4309.28 --> 4312.5599999999995
that's a little expensive

4313.6 --> 4316.88
no i'm not gonna say it

4326.56 --> 4332.320000000001
just donate now before i heighten the

4330.0 --> 4332.32
rate

4332.56 --> 4336.04
because i will

4345.84 --> 4351.719
no

4347.28 --> 4351.719
20 euros not 10 dollars

4384.8 --> 4389.28
ten thousand for using sex synthesis

4389.6 --> 4392.6
okay

4398.64 --> 4404.88
is effie dub bates

4402.56 --> 4407.84
on today no

4404.88 --> 4410.08
it's sunday bali cats

4407.84 --> 4412.64
nathan does a live show

4410.08 --> 4414.32
monday tooth thrive

4412.64 --> 4415.84
you should know that he's been doing

4414.32 --> 4419.36
that for

4415.84 --> 4419.360000000001
four five years now

4424.88 --> 4428.88
yeah five years man damn

4433.36 --> 4439.36
but there should be a premiere

4436.0 --> 4441.6
i think there was a premiere

4439.36 --> 4444.48
let's see the notification let me check

4441.6 --> 4444.4800000000005
out which one it was

4447.36 --> 4451.32
oh no it's just a short

4459.6 --> 4465.120000000001
but yesterday's premiere was awesome

4461.6 --> 4468.0
which one was it 1590

4465.12 --> 4469.76
that was really good i really liked it i

4468.0 --> 4471.52
was very active in it

4469.76 --> 4473.84
set a cup like i got a really good

4471.52 --> 4475.280000000001
compliment from kiwi which i really

4473.84 --> 4477.12
appreciate it

4475.28 --> 4479.599999999999
like he doesn't give out compliments

4477.12 --> 4479.599999999999
easily

4481.199 --> 4486.0
i'm surprised that he was just in that

4483.28 --> 4488.5599999999995
state when he hadn't even had breakfast

4486.0 --> 4491.12
like that that's the more surprising

4488.56 --> 4493.04
thing about it that kiwi was in a

4491.12 --> 4496.04
relatively good mood without having

4493.04 --> 4496.04
breakfast

4496.08 --> 4499.76
i think there was just a lot of good

4497.36 --> 4501.759999999999
energy in the air

4499.76 --> 4505.76
that day

4501.76 --> 4505.76
and we're all able to utilize it

4508.4 --> 4515.199
50 91 is premiering no it isn't

4512.719 --> 4519.28
it's just a short

4515.199 --> 4519.28
trigger it's a short call triggered

4520.48 --> 4525.839999999999
or is it

4522.32 --> 4525.84
is it the entire show hold on

4540.64 --> 4545.88
no you're right it is the entire show

4542.88 --> 4545.88
alright

4573.28 --> 4577.28
do you think steps what

4575.52 --> 4580.679
baldy cats

4577.28 --> 4580.679
did what

4584.56 --> 4587.76
probably

4586.64 --> 4589.6
i mean

4587.76 --> 4592.96
like

4589.6 --> 4594.400000000001
spring sunlight definitely activates a

4592.96 --> 4597.04
whole bunch of things

4594.4 --> 4599.36
polycats i don't know though it's like

4597.04 --> 4603.8
i'm not a

4599.36 --> 4603.799999999999
bio researcher like that

4622.88 --> 4628.56
toon has 33 kids

4626.0 --> 4631.04
really howard moore

4628.56 --> 4631.04
really

4631.28 --> 4633.84
uh

4631.87 --> 4636.88
[Music]

4633.84 --> 4641.04
i really doubt that

4636.88 --> 4641.04
unless you just meant three kids

4645.92 --> 4650.4
i mean there's no way in hell like

4648.4 --> 4653.599999999999
that's physically impossible

4650.4 --> 4655.679
to get 33 kids out of one woman

4653.6 --> 4658.64
so unless he was like

4655.679 --> 4658.64
a polygamist

4658.719 --> 4663.199
married to multiple wives i i don't see

4661.679 --> 4665.84
how that would even be physically

4663.199 --> 4665.839999999999
possible

4683.12 --> 4688.08
i scoffed at you

4685.679 --> 4691.56
i don't remember what it was howard or i

4688.08 --> 4691.5599999999995
mean stone monkey

4715.679 --> 4718.0
what

4718.56 --> 4721.84
what was that

4722.08 --> 4728.6
did you guys hear that

4724.8 --> 4728.6
where did that come from

4736.01 --> 4739.089
[Music]

4746.84 --> 4753.4400000000005
oh yeah dr utker

4750.96 --> 4757.679
you're nobody's gonna do that

4753.44 --> 4758.719
nobody is going to do that okay stop

4757.679 --> 4760.159
stop

4758.719 --> 4763.12
this [ __ ]

4760.159 --> 4765.5199999999995
i'm not taking the i'm not taking a bite

4763.12 --> 4767.76
nobody's gonna do that it's absolutely

4765.52 --> 4770.4800000000005
nonsense

4767.76 --> 4773.679
hey my webcam is stuck right

4770.48 --> 4776.678999999999
see it weird

4773.679 --> 4776.679
why

4777.199 --> 4780.799999999999
let me

4778.159 --> 4780.799999999999
reset it

4783.679 --> 4787.8
yeah that was weird

4795.92 --> 4799.52
yeah thanks for telling me that was

4797.92 --> 4802.2390000000005
probably that weird click i heard but i

4799.52 --> 4804.52
have no idea what even happened

4802.239 --> 4805.919999999999
i just had to go into uh

4804.52 --> 4808.96
[Music]

4805.92 --> 4811.36
into obs and just reset the camera

4808.96 --> 4814.2390000000005
deactivate reactivate

4811.36 --> 4817.239
i have no idea why that happened this is

4814.239 --> 4817.239
whatever

4823.04 --> 4827.44
why does nobody want to do it because

4825.12 --> 4829.28
nobody is dumb enough to believe they're

4827.44 --> 4833.678999999999
actually going to be paid ten thousand

4829.28 --> 4835.599999999999
dollars dr utker that's why

4833.679 --> 4839.1990000000005
it's stupid

4835.6 --> 4841.4400000000005
nobody's gonna buy into that

4839.199 --> 4843.12
i mean you'd have more chance actually

4841.44 --> 4844.96
getting that kind of money out of a

4843.12 --> 4846.88
lottery

4844.96 --> 4849.84
i'm serious there's more chance that

4846.88 --> 4851.92
you'd actually get that kind of a money

4849.84 --> 4855.52
out of a lottery

4851.92 --> 4858.08
than by by going on to that challenge

4855.52 --> 4860.96
for ten thousand dollars there's no

4858.08 --> 4864.0
chance zero that anybody is ever going

4860.96 --> 4865.28
to get paid that kind of money over that

4864.0 --> 4867.6
challenge

4865.28 --> 4869.5199999999995
unless they were body buddies and it's

4867.6 --> 4871.84
just a shill action and he's literally

4869.52 --> 4874.159000000001
gonna give the money back just

4871.84 --> 4875.679
just for a demonstration to convince

4874.159 --> 4878.32
people that he would actually do that

4875.679 --> 4881.639
because nobody would actually do that

4878.32 --> 4881.639
it's ridiculous

4889.28 --> 4893.36
even without the money it would prove

4890.88 --> 4896.32
something yeah it would prove

4893.36 --> 4899.5199999999995
that ballers tried to make flat earthers

4896.32 --> 4901.5199999999995
do stupid things that they don't need to

4899.52 --> 4903.1990000000005
do to prove anything

4901.52 --> 4904.56
because we've already proven the earth

4903.199 --> 4908.239
is not a ball

4904.56 --> 4908.2390000000005
through basic geometry

4912.08 --> 4918.4
yeah we don't need to

4914.48 --> 4922.08
do your tests to prove our case we've

4918.4 --> 4924.638999999999
already won we don't need to do anything

4922.08 --> 4924.639
you say

4925.92 --> 4931.679
we will not get any advantage out of it

4930.08 --> 4933.04
because we know

4931.679 --> 4934.4
you're not going to pay that kind of

4933.04 --> 4937.84
money

4934.4 --> 4940.4
and we know that even associating with

4937.84 --> 4942.96
anti-flaglers at this point is only

4940.4 --> 4944.879999999999
detrimental because you just edit [ __ ]

4942.96 --> 4947.92
out of context and then you

4944.88 --> 4949.92
end up blabbering and spreading rumors

4947.92 --> 4953.84
and [ __ ] and just slandering

4949.92 --> 4953.84
endlessly after that point

4954.56 --> 4959.84
nobody's gonna do your stupid challenges

4958.08 --> 4962.239
we don't care

4959.84 --> 4965.76
we don't need to do your challenges

4962.239 --> 4968.759999999999
we've already won the argument

4965.76 --> 4968.76
utterly

4979.92 --> 4985.12
we use the section to prove it doesn't

4981.6 --> 4987.120000000001
work on the glove okay fine

4985.12 --> 4988.88
why would anybody pay ten thousand

4987.12 --> 4991.36
dollars for that

4988.88 --> 4991.36
it just

4991.6 --> 4995.400000000001
doesn't make any sense

5000.32 --> 5003.44
text nathan to come and mock them after

5002.719 --> 5007.159
no

5003.44 --> 5007.159
no he's had enough

5015.679 --> 5020.8
validate his expertise no

5018.56 --> 5020.8
no

5021.199 --> 5028.4
nobody needs to do anything to entertain

5024.56 --> 5029.1990000000005
you or your stupid challenges nobody

5028.4 --> 5031.599999999999
yeah

5029.199 --> 5033.678999999999
if 10th man wanted to

5031.6 --> 5036.4800000000005
like

5033.679 --> 5039.679
prove more of his expertise then he

5036.48 --> 5041.12
would buy his own volition on his own

5039.679 --> 5043.12
time

5041.12 --> 5045.28
with his own sextants because he has

5043.12 --> 5047.28
many of them physical

5045.28 --> 5048.239
physically has them

5047.28 --> 5050.08
he

5048.239 --> 5053.5199999999995
would go out

5050.08 --> 5055.679
on a boat with somebody with a camera or

5053.52 --> 5058.080000000001
he would be the camera guys let somebody

5055.679 --> 5061.36
else do it and then literally on the

5058.08 --> 5063.36
spot demonstrate how it's done

5061.36 --> 5066.719
he would just do that

5063.36 --> 5068.0
we don't need to go to any baller

5066.719 --> 5069.36
challenge

5068.0 --> 5073.12
for that

5069.36 --> 5073.12
that would only work against us

5073.679 --> 5079.12
nobody's going to entertain baller

5076.239 --> 5080.799999999999
challenges because it's a waste of time

5079.12 --> 5083.12
earth isn't the ball

5080.8 --> 5085.76
we don't need to do anything to prove

5083.12 --> 5088.48
that it's already proven through

5085.76 --> 5088.4800000000005
geometry

5095.28 --> 5099.159
you and your sex sensor

5103.6 --> 5108.120000000001
you and your triangles are ruined

5108.55 --> 5111.64
[Music]

5116.239 --> 5119.239
um

5131.52 --> 5136.400000000001
yeah i could help you baldy cats it's

5134.08 --> 5139.199
gonna cost you twenty dollars

5136.4 --> 5142.159
20 euros i'm sorry through the paypal

5139.199 --> 5142.159
then i can help you

5156.56 --> 5162.320000000001
i think that's a good title

5159.6 --> 5162.320000000001
i'll do that

5162.719 --> 5173.039
you and your triangles have been ruined

5166.99 --> 5173.039
[Applause]

5264.88 --> 5271.159000000001
right anyway i'm getting two minute

5267.28 --> 5271.159
break i'll be right back

5402.88 --> 5406.04
thank you

5419.92 --> 5424.8
most mathematicians know how to get a 90

5422.719 --> 5427.04
on the ball or really

5424.8 --> 5429.4400000000005
so are you one of those

5427.04 --> 5430.719
or are you just relying on that somebody

5429.44 --> 5434.28
has to know

5430.719 --> 5434.28
akuma virus

5434.48 --> 5438.32
so

5436.08 --> 5442.0
explain to me how do you get that then

5438.32 --> 5442.0
how do you get a 90 on a ball

5442.639 --> 5448.159000000001
right 90 from your position to the

5445.84 --> 5449.12
horizon

5448.159 --> 5451.199
to

5449.12 --> 5453.28
the celestial light

5451.199 --> 5456.08
right that triangle how do you get it

5453.28 --> 5458.0
then right most mathematicians know

5456.08 --> 5459.44
akuma virus

5458.0 --> 5462.239
you said you were one why didn't you

5459.44 --> 5465.759999999999
explain then

5462.239 --> 5468.799999999999
oh it's old news really what what is old

5465.76 --> 5470.639
news can you lay down what the old news

5468.8 --> 5474.28
exactly is can you actually explain it

5470.639 --> 5474.28
then akuma virus

5478.639 --> 5483.84
ray tracers depend on it to calculate

5481.92 --> 5487.04
reflections on the ball

5483.84 --> 5488.88
yeah that's when they ray trace the 3d

5487.04 --> 5491.84
imagery of a ball

5488.88 --> 5494.56
at a distance from spurs yeah that's how

5491.84 --> 5494.56
they do that

5494.639 --> 5497.4400000000005
right

5495.44 --> 5501.599999999999
we were talking about

5497.44 --> 5501.599999999999
being on the surface

5503.28 --> 5507.04
and then

5504.4 --> 5509.04
getting that straight baseline to the

5507.04 --> 5513.48
horizon

5509.04 --> 5513.48
so how do you do that on a ball

5518.32 --> 5524.08
what do you want oh my god oh cool

5521.92 --> 5526.0
i just want you to stop bluffing about

5524.08 --> 5527.12
something that you obviously don't know

5526.0 --> 5529.52
how to do

5527.12 --> 5530.8
most mathematicians know that no they

5529.52 --> 5532.719
don't

5530.8 --> 5536.88
you don't

5532.719 --> 5536.88
you're an idiot for even saying that

5537.28 --> 5542.159
i can't seriously believe that people

5539.04 --> 5544.639
are just gonna buy that

5542.159 --> 5545.679
when we all know you don't know how to

5544.639 --> 5547.76
do that

5545.679 --> 5549.4400000000005
nobody does that's the point that's what

5547.76 --> 5552.639
we've been talking about on the flat

5549.44 --> 5556.239
earth debate to no end

5552.639 --> 5558.159000000001
in the last month to no end

5556.239 --> 5561.04
it's not hard yeah yeah but you can

5558.159 --> 5563.28
actually explain how it's not hard

5561.04 --> 5565.04
as in what it actually is you do in

5563.28 --> 5566.8
order to do it that's the part that you

5565.04 --> 5568.88
can explain it's not hard everybody

5566.8 --> 5571.52
knows it's not hard yeah but you can't

5568.88 --> 5573.92
actually say what it is though can you

5571.52 --> 5576.159000000001
because if you could have you would have

5573.92 --> 5579.04
on the flat earth debates

5576.159 --> 5579.04
you can't

5579.76 --> 5586.2390000000005
don't want anybody to take my word

5582.639 --> 5589.04
you don't have a word for it

5586.239 --> 5591.678999999999
why don't you stop speculating

5589.04 --> 5595.679
on how we respond to that which you do

5591.679 --> 5598.2390000000005
not have and we know you don't have it

5595.679 --> 5600.88
stop this stupid bluffakumu virus you're

5598.239 --> 5603.5199999999995
getting really annoying

5600.88 --> 5604.96
we're not buying your bluff you don't

5603.52 --> 5608.2390000000005
have it

5604.96 --> 5608.2390000000005
you haven't explained

5611.36 --> 5617.12
we've all been listening to what you

5613.44 --> 5619.12
said none of it makes sense

5617.12 --> 5623.28
you don't actually

5619.12 --> 5623.28
have a flat baseline on the ball

5624.159 --> 5627.799999999999
you don't have it

5630.56 --> 5634.8
horizontal you say oh

5632.48 --> 5634.799999999999
really

5635.44 --> 5639.759999999999
how do you get the flat plane to the

5637.679 --> 5642.2390000000005
horizon

5639.76 --> 5644.88
on a ball

5642.239 --> 5646.48
so easy you can say it oh we just have

5644.88 --> 5649.92
we just have a straight line to the

5646.48 --> 5654.239
right yeah yeah but it's a ball though

5649.92 --> 5654.2390000000005
yeah so you don't actually have that

5655.679 --> 5658.88
you don't want [ __ ] well you're not

5657.199 --> 5661.44
gonna get bitcoin

5658.88 --> 5664.400000000001
why don't you start actually

5661.44 --> 5664.4
no flat plane

5664.8 --> 5668.2390000000005
getting a little jumbled up there

5669.52 --> 5674.320000000001
yeah you're not gonna get bitcoin you

5672.32 --> 5676.0
you don't even have an argument you have

5674.32 --> 5678.159
nothing you just have a bunch of bluff

5676.0 --> 5680.239
about how everybody knows it and you've

5678.159 --> 5682.239
already said it but you don't ever

5680.239 --> 5686.239
actually mention it

5682.239 --> 5688.5599999999995
and then you speculate on how everybody

5686.239 --> 5691.759999999999
has responded to that thing which you

5688.56 --> 5691.76
haven't actually said

5692.08 --> 5697.199
right because if you had it you'd

5694.239 --> 5699.599999999999
literally be copying pasting

5697.199 --> 5702.08
a perfectly worked out argument that

5699.6 --> 5705.6
would be an effective rebuttal and you'd

5702.08 --> 5708.48
be spamming that constantly

5705.6 --> 5711.360000000001
you'd be literally saying that like just

5708.48 --> 5713.839999999999
like how sean hawkins when he shows up

5711.36 --> 5715.36
thinks he at least actually believes he

5713.84 --> 5718.400000000001
has an argument when he does the stupid

5715.36 --> 5719.839999999999
polaris challenge nolan's

5718.4 --> 5721.199
challenge thing

5719.84 --> 5723.119000000001
and then he spams that because he

5721.199 --> 5726.799999999999
actually believes that work well if you

5723.119 --> 5729.199
actually had a knowledge of how to do it

5726.8 --> 5731.1990000000005
akuma virus you wouldn't just be talking

5729.199 --> 5733.678999999999
constantly about how you have it and

5731.199 --> 5735.119
everybody knows it no you'd be literally

5733.679 --> 5737.1990000000005
telling us

5735.119 --> 5740.799999999999
verbatim

5737.199 --> 5743.599999999999
again and again and again and again how

5740.8 --> 5746.2390000000005
to do it you'd be imprinting us it in

5743.6 --> 5748.320000000001
our minds constantly because you knew

5746.239 --> 5750.5599999999995
how to do it but you don't do that

5748.32 --> 5752.719
because you don't know how to do it

5750.56 --> 5753.92
you're just bluffing and we've called

5752.719 --> 5756.639
your bluff

5753.92 --> 5759.1990000000005
we know you're bluffing akuma virus

5756.639 --> 5761.76
we're not idiots

5759.199 --> 5765.28
we don't buy cheap

5761.76 --> 5765.280000000001
parlor tricks like that

5774.239 --> 5779.879999999999
you're just gaslighting yourself now man

5776.32 --> 5779.88
it's really pathetic

5789.92 --> 5794.4
i'm not buying your

5793.199 --> 5798.119
ball

5794.4 --> 5798.119
bluff crack

5798.4 --> 5802.5599999999995
you don't have any

5800.239 --> 5804.959999999999
you don't have any we're not convinced

5802.56 --> 5807.280000000001
you have any you can pretend all day

5804.96 --> 5809.44
long like you do and speculate on how

5807.28 --> 5811.119
you virtue how everybody virtually

5809.44 --> 5813.759999999999
responds to that thing you virtually

5811.119 --> 5816.159
have but you don't you don't have it and

5813.76 --> 5818.159000000001
everybody knows you don't have it

5816.159 --> 5820.638999999999
you're not fooling anybody i bet you're

5818.159 --> 5822.4
barely fooling yourself in this stupid

5820.639 --> 5826.08
little bluff

5822.4 --> 5827.5199999999995
that nobody's buying

5826.08 --> 5830.0
why don't you just stop lying to

5827.52 --> 5830.0
yourself

5832.639 --> 5837.92
you're not gonna try to people that

5834.719 --> 5839.6
don't listen oh really

5837.92 --> 5842.639
or you're just not gonna do it because

5839.6 --> 5842.639
you don't have anything

5842.88 --> 5846.719
because if you did you'd be rubbing it

5845.04 --> 5850.159
in our faces

5846.719 --> 5852.639
but you don't and you know you don't

5850.159 --> 5855.839999999999
so you're just bluffing

5852.639 --> 5855.84
like an idiot

5859.199 --> 5863.28
you don't want to convince anybody yeah

5861.119 --> 5865.759999999999
yeah well you're not you're definitely

5863.28 --> 5869.08
succeeding at not convincing anybody

5865.76 --> 5869.08
that's right

5879.36 --> 5885.44
dude stop this stupid speculation

5882.8 --> 5887.04
akumavirus stop speculating you're

5885.44 --> 5890.638999999999
terrible at it

5887.04 --> 5892.639
if you'd have anything you'd lay it down

5890.639 --> 5895.1990000000005
you'd lay it down right in front of us

5892.639 --> 5897.84
you'd stop speculating about how our

5895.199 --> 5900.239
responses are and would be

5897.84 --> 5901.84
you just say it

5900.239 --> 5903.44
but you don't because you don't have

5901.84 --> 5905.04
anything you're bluffing and we're

5903.44 --> 5906.32
calling your bluff we know you're

5905.04 --> 5910.199
bluffing

5906.32 --> 5910.199
you're not fooling anybody

5919.44 --> 5922.44
right

5928.4 --> 5934.5599999999995
yeah you are bluffing akuma virus stop

5930.8 --> 5936.320000000001
lying or i'm gonna time you out

5934.56 --> 5939.84
just put a lid on it

5936.32 --> 5939.84
and getting sick of your nonsense

5948.159 --> 5952.799999999999
yeah

5950.4 --> 5953.759999999999
you are you are bluffing you don't have

5952.8 --> 5955.52
anything

5953.76 --> 5957.84
if you had you put it down right in

5955.52 --> 5960.080000000001
front of us you don't

5957.84 --> 5962.159000000001
and you make up excuses

5960.08 --> 5963.44
as to why you don't why you don't need

5962.159 --> 5965.36
to

5963.44 --> 5967.839999999999
and then you proceed to speculate on

5965.36 --> 5969.759999999999
what would happen if you had it this is

5967.84 --> 5972.400000000001
all a bunch of presuppositional

5969.76 --> 5977.159000000001
knowledge [ __ ]

5972.4 --> 5977.159
about something you literally don't have

6000.639 --> 6005.4400000000005
why did i ban him because he was a

6002.88 --> 6008.4800000000005
disgusting [ __ ]

6005.44 --> 6010.08
disgusting individual sticky

6008.48 --> 6011.678999999999
sock

6010.08 --> 6014.719
that's why

6011.679 --> 6018.0
i do not want a guy like that

6014.719 --> 6018.0
for any reason

6018.239 --> 6024.638999999999
in proximity to what i do ever

6023.0 --> 6027.28
disgusting

6024.639 --> 6027.28
[ __ ]

6030.48 --> 6037.36
i have more respect for the average

6032.56 --> 6038.96
baller than for that disgusting guy

6037.36 --> 6039.92
and they don't have a lot of respect for

6038.96 --> 6043.44
ballers

6039.92 --> 6046.6
well enough i got just about as much as

6043.44 --> 6046.599999999999
they deserve

6051.04 --> 6054.4
it's right back

6052.719 --> 6055.84
yep

6054.4 --> 6059.159
all right anyway i think i'm gonna round

6055.84 --> 6059.159000000001
out the show

6070.48 --> 6072.959999999999
i'm kind of disappointed i didn't get

6072.08 --> 6075.28
any

6072.96 --> 6079.719
more paypal support though

6075.28 --> 6079.719
that's two days in a row now

6089.76 --> 6093.4400000000005
right

6090.96 --> 6095.28
so yeah i hope that kind of picks up

6093.44 --> 6096.4
quickly because otherwise i'm going to

6095.28 --> 6098.88
be in

6096.4 --> 6101.28
more financial trouble right

6098.88 --> 6103.119
more i get eventually i will be at a

6101.28 --> 6107.84
point where i just literally will

6103.119 --> 6107.839999999999
physically be be unable to do the show

6108.08 --> 6111.82
i try to keep everybody warned about

6110.4 --> 6114.159
that

6111.82 --> 6115.759999999999
[Music]

6114.159 --> 6118.0
but yeah

6115.76 --> 6120.8
i don't know maybe i'll just have to one

6118.0 --> 6123.36
day not show up anymore

6120.8 --> 6124.8
and then keep not showing up

6123.36 --> 6126.799999999999
in order for people to actually

6124.8 --> 6129.92
understand

6126.8 --> 6133.8
that i am not bluffing about it i'm not

6129.92 --> 6133.8
bluffing about my situation

6136.88 --> 6139.84
get on your tutor

6138.639 --> 6142.719
hunt

6139.84 --> 6144.639
paid english teach

6142.719 --> 6146.639
no

6144.639 --> 6147.76
i'm not going to be participating in

6146.639 --> 6149.92
school

6147.76 --> 6152.2390000000005
you know even what school is like these

6149.92 --> 6153.6
days

6152.239 --> 6157.239
there's no way

6153.6 --> 6157.2390000000005
there's no way

6170.719 --> 6175.36
thirty dollars it's a disaster bolly

6173.84 --> 6176.88
cats

6175.36 --> 6180.239
being a teacher especially in the

6176.88 --> 6182.8
netherlands has always been a disaster

6180.239 --> 6185.839999999999
i know because my mother was one and it

6182.8 --> 6187.6
was always a disaster

6185.84 --> 6191.360000000001
not because you were bad teachers but

6187.6 --> 6193.280000000001
because teachers just it's an impossible

6191.36 --> 6196.0
job

6193.28 --> 6199.28
the amount of demands

6196.0 --> 6201.84
which you and the stress is just no

6199.28 --> 6203.679
it's a no

6201.84 --> 6206.159000000001

i mean

6225.119 --> 6229.759999999999
if that would have had been appealing in

6227.84 --> 6232.56
any sort of way

6229.76 --> 6236.56
yeah then i would have actually gone to

6232.56 --> 6236.56
do that 20 years ago

6236.8 --> 6242.639
but from my experience with what it's

6239.92 --> 6244.4
like to be a teacher from my mother

6242.639 --> 6246.56
everything i've been told

6244.4 --> 6250.719
it's a disaster

6246.56 --> 6254.159000000001
it literally kills you from the inside

6250.719 --> 6254.159
i'm not gonna do that

6257.92 --> 6261.6

like phil b has supported me

6311.36 --> 6314.839999999999
right that's why i

6313.199 --> 6318.159
i don't

6314.84 --> 6320.0
just like

6318.159 --> 6321.92
yeah that's why i don't

6320.0 --> 6324.32
deal with him like he is a troll because

6321.92 --> 6327.04
he's actually

6324.32 --> 6327.04
supported me

6327.84 --> 6331.4400000000005
yeah it brings advantages

6330.4 --> 6334.719
it does

6331.44 --> 6337.44
it's not it's not like you can get me

6334.719 --> 6338.56
or get me to do things because you pay

6337.44 --> 6340.96
me

6338.56 --> 6343.360000000001
but it will have a natural

6340.96 --> 6345.04
respect effect

6343.36 --> 6347.5199999999995
that i will honor

6345.04 --> 6347.5199999999995
i do

6347.6 --> 6351.679
right unless i detect that you

6349.199 --> 6354.239
specifically donate to me to try and

6351.679 --> 6357.1990000000005
make me do things and abuse me

6354.239 --> 6359.04
that way then i that respect is quickly

6357.199 --> 6361.36
gone

6359.04 --> 6363.76
but it's in your best interest to

6361.36 --> 6365.28
basically donate to my paypal

6363.76 --> 6368.8
it's not a joke

6365.28 --> 6371.36

6371.36 --> 6376.08
take that advantage i really need to

6472.88 --> 6477.92
possessed

6475.04 --> 6481.5199999999995
with your delusions if you prioritize

6477.92 --> 6483.679
your delusions above common decency

6481.52 --> 6484.719
that's when you become my enemy

6483.679 --> 6487.6

6484.719 --> 6489.84
most of you are just like trying to deal

6487.6 --> 6491.360000000001

get around and

6491.36 --> 6494.239

6492.32 --> 6496.639

6494.239 --> 6499.599999999999
do lie when push comes to shove but

6496.639 --> 6500.639
that's really more your problem

6499.6 --> 6503.679
