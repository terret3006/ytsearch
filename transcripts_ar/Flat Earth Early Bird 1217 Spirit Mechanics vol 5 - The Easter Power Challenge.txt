and a membership system join button that

76.24 --> 82.479
would be much appreciated

78.88 --> 84.24
and i could always use it

82.479 --> 85.36
so

84.24 --> 87.439
yeah

85.36 --> 92.72
weather today would have been

87.439 --> 95.03999999999999
absolutely nice and glorious but yeah

92.72 --> 95.03999999999999
then

95.759 --> 99.68
they had to just

97.36 --> 100.64
trail the [ __ ] out of the skies i've

99.68 --> 102.72000000000001
never

100.64 --> 105.84
seen it like this heavy

102.72 --> 108.88
before like this year

105.84 --> 111.2
so they started pretty early

108.88 --> 113.28
and just like massive

111.2 --> 114.72
feathers

113.28 --> 115.52
you could literally

114.72 --> 117.52
like

115.52 --> 119.52
this time they were throwing buckets of

117.52 --> 121.759
the stuff because you could immediately

119.52 --> 124.0
see blown apart like

121.759 --> 127.04
dune ripples

124.0 --> 128.399
it's quite this yeah quite concerning

127.04 --> 130.8
to look at that

128.399 --> 132.08
so i really hope this is just dust or

130.8 --> 134.31900000000002
something

132.08 --> 136.08
but whatever it is it is completely

134.319 --> 137.28
graying up the sky that would be

136.08 --> 141.72
otherwise

137.28 --> 141.72
just gorgeous blue

142.8 --> 150.16000000000003
there's not much wind out there

145.98 --> 152.48
[Music]

150.16 --> 156.0
and yeah despite all that there's still

152.48 --> 157.76
a lot of sun coming through

156.0 --> 159.2
but yeah look

157.76 --> 163.04
again

159.2 --> 163.04
another one of these look at that

163.28 --> 167.909
sheesh

164.34 --> 167.909
[Music]

168.48 --> 171.84
you see that

173.2 --> 183.959
[Music]

180.08 --> 183.959
right right there

194.879 --> 198.12
oh well

198.22 --> 203.79
[Music]

205.28 --> 207.76
all right

208.879 --> 214.239
hello mike sadoonich

211.28 --> 216.4
first in chat jeff gassett good to see

214.239 --> 216.4
you

216.56 --> 222.12
it is monday the 18th of april 2022

226.159 --> 230.879
feel pretty good

228.319 --> 232.879
i think might

230.879 --> 236.48
like to hear your judgment basically

232.879 --> 236.48
about how my face is looking

236.72 --> 241.0
i think it should be a little better

241.519 --> 246.41
all right but yeah for some reason

244.64 --> 248.0
in the evenings i do

246.41 --> 250.0
[Music]

248.0 --> 252.239
still get like moments where it kind of

250.0 --> 253.76
inflames but it's all it's different now

252.239 --> 256.23900000000003
and yeah i'm

253.76 --> 258.15999999999997
guys i'm just like eating

256.239 --> 260.79999999999995
steak

258.16 --> 264.129
really cheap ones

260.8 --> 264.129
[Music]

265.68 --> 270.08
and yeah that's working fine and i'm

267.52 --> 273.12
like chewing on this side

270.08 --> 275.19899999999996
and it's actually kind of stimulating

273.12 --> 277.52
i think it's like helping

275.199 --> 279.12
things get pushing things around in

277.52 --> 280.479
there at this point

279.12 --> 282.96
is like

280.479 --> 284.71999999999997
helpful for the regeneration process

282.96 --> 287.28
which i think it is already engaging

284.72 --> 289.68
because it just feels a lot better

287.28 --> 292.08
like in the jaw area right because

289.68 --> 292.96
there's still just stuff going on there

292.08 --> 296.639
it's

292.96 --> 298.96
i think like whatever this was it's

296.639 --> 300.08
basically like affected a whole bunch of

298.96 --> 302.88
things

300.08 --> 302.88
in my face

306.72 --> 311.759
and so now those other regions are just

309.039 --> 314.32
kind of like trying to resolve last

311.759 --> 316.8
issues anyway look a lot better okay

314.32 --> 318.56
that glad to hear that

316.8 --> 323.72
looking good

318.56 --> 323.72
i also took just a refreshing shower

324.72 --> 327.759
see

325.52 --> 329.44
let me shine some light right in my face

327.759 --> 332.68
see if that even

329.44 --> 332.68
that registers

338.72 --> 342.8
wow not much of that light is coming

340.56 --> 342.8
through

348.96 --> 355.39
right but i guess it's almost

353.36 --> 356.47900000000004
symmetrical again

355.39 --> 360.4
[Music]

356.479 --> 362.16999999999996
oh i'm so vain i'm so vain

360.4 --> 366.15999999999997
ugh

362.17 --> 368.08000000000004
[Music]

366.16 --> 369.14000000000004
i don't know it's

368.08 --> 370.88
confidence issue

369.14 --> 374.61
[Music]

370.88 --> 376.15999999999997
right but yeah i'm doing better and

374.61 --> 378.16
[Music]

376.16 --> 379.68
as expected after these types of

378.16 --> 382.16
situations

379.68 --> 383.759
suddenly getting a lot of detail room in

382.16 --> 384.8
my head

383.759 --> 387.12
and

384.8 --> 389.36
that's the funny thing how it works that

387.12 --> 389.36
like

390.24 --> 394.40000000000003
because of this

391.84 --> 397.11999999999995
associated memories with past events

394.4 --> 398.63899999999995
where i was in similar situations but

397.12 --> 400.56
in the second half of it the

398.639 --> 404.88
regeneration phase

400.56 --> 407.84
while i'm doing that i suddenly get like

404.88 --> 410.56
like deeper memories like even of what

407.84 --> 413.44
it was like what my energy was like why

410.56 --> 415.919
it was like that and truly like

413.44 --> 417.28
i'm able to almost grab back from the

415.919 --> 420.479
past

417.28 --> 422.63899999999995
the level of energy i was at

420.479 --> 424.88
it's fascinating how that works every

422.639 --> 424.88
time

425.12 --> 427.44
right

430.0 --> 434.28
you are on show to the world's

439.759 --> 442.08000000000004
right

443.52 --> 447.84
but yeah

445.52 --> 451.479
thinking a lot about spirit mechanics in

447.84 --> 451.479
many different ways

453.68 --> 457.199
and it's

455.36 --> 459.28000000000003
it kind of makes me happy because in the

457.199 --> 461.199
past i was thinking about it

459.28 --> 464.71999999999997
yet i had

461.199 --> 466.40000000000003
i saw so much structure yet couldn't

464.72 --> 468.24
latch it onto

466.4 --> 470.71999999999997
things

468.24 --> 472.8
in comparison except for just the raw

470.72 --> 474.879
readout of whatever my senses were

472.8 --> 477.28000000000003
telling me in detail about what was

474.879 --> 481.03900000000004
going on but yeah without the context

477.28 --> 483.28
without a bigger oversight wisdom

481.039 --> 486.15999999999997
it's all just like whoa so much detail

483.28 --> 488.87899999999996
but it's detail you don't understand

486.16 --> 488.879
but now

489.28 --> 493.75899999999996
once i then for some reason zone into

492.0 --> 497.52
onto that

493.759 --> 497.52000000000004
energy level of back then

499.599 --> 505.199
it's like i completely remember it with

502.08 --> 508.4
those details with the read like with

505.199 --> 510.16
all the sensory details it's like i am

508.4 --> 512.159
back then

510.16 --> 513.2
and that's strong but

512.159 --> 515.76
now

513.2 --> 518.839
where that place on the inside certain

515.76 --> 522.479
spot was kind of like uh vacuous

518.839 --> 524.24
like we don't know how to contextualize

522.479 --> 527.279
this

524.24 --> 529.519
like i even knew that back then now

527.279 --> 531.92
that part is filled with me and my

529.519 --> 535.839
understanding from now

531.92 --> 535.8389999999999
and it's a fascinating way

536.08 --> 541.2
it like works out

539.04 --> 543.5999999999999
it's magical

541.2 --> 543.6
to me

543.76 --> 549.8389999999999
and maybe to you guys too i don't know

546.32 --> 552.399
how many other people have like

549.839 --> 553.6800000000001
this experience they probably should

552.399 --> 556.48
have

553.68 --> 556.4799999999999
but if they do

557.76 --> 561.04
yeah

558.64 --> 563.279
it's it's gonna be very hard to describe

561.04 --> 565.04
that oh and i just gave it a pretty good

563.279 --> 567.4399999999999
shot i think

565.04 --> 567.4399999999999
anyway

569.36 --> 573.8000000000001
yeah yesterday's show was pretty cool

580.64 --> 583.12
and

581.68 --> 585.68
yeah i've been watching some other

583.12 --> 585.68
things too

587.519 --> 590.8
yeah clutch

589.04 --> 594.24
remember clutch

590.8 --> 594.24
apparently he did a hangout

595.36 --> 598.5600000000001
with some lady

599.12 --> 604.519
who's like really into chickens and it's

601.519 --> 604.519
adorable

604.72 --> 608.48
like she has her own channel and all

606.24 --> 608.48
that

608.64 --> 614.3199999999999
and yeah he had his first hangout with

610.959 --> 615.279
her for like an hour and

614.32 --> 617.6800000000001
that was

615.279 --> 621.4399999999999
like very enjoyable

617.68 --> 621.4399999999999
so shout out to you clutch

627.36 --> 632.24
i mean i think you two would probably

630.399 --> 634.079
be able to have a lot of interesting

632.24 --> 636.16
conversations

634.079 --> 638.7199999999999
about a whole bunch of things like bare

636.16 --> 640.88
things and a lot of food preparation

638.72 --> 642.1600000000001
talk

640.88 --> 645.6
and some

642.16 --> 647.76
well kind of esoteric christian stuff

645.6 --> 650.24
of course bear oriented

647.76 --> 653.92
and it was just great

650.24 --> 656.16
i have to watch it okay i can link it up

653.92 --> 660.36
uh

656.16 --> 660.36
i'm sure he doesn't mind

666.88 --> 672.64
i mean it's just public youtube

670.8 --> 674.56
and it's fun like at the beginning

672.64 --> 677.04
they're kind of like

674.56 --> 678.64
yeah because like it was his first time

677.04 --> 680.959
guys like

678.64 --> 685.4399999999999
he got over that a lot quicker than i

680.959 --> 686.399
did when i was doing my first shows

685.44 --> 688.24
so

686.399 --> 690.56
like they really got into it and they

688.24 --> 692.24
connected and was just super enjoyable

690.56 --> 694.56
it's almost like they were just having a

692.24 --> 696.72
private

694.56 --> 698.8
conversation and they kind of forgot

696.72 --> 700.9590000000001
that everybody's watching it just really

698.8 --> 705.04
like or they probably weren't but it

700.959 --> 705.04
just felt like that just great

705.15 --> 710.3199999999999
[Music]

706.959 --> 710.3199999999999
anyway enjoy that

710.639 --> 716.44
yeah bear oriented indeed kind of bear

713.44 --> 716.44
hello

728.32 --> 735.0790000000001
a flatter sage good to see you

731.68 --> 735.079
borders boy

751.36 --> 756.839
hey terry 306

753.6 --> 758.72
huh everybody in the house

756.839 --> 761.36
um

758.72 --> 765.1600000000001
got some gusto

761.36 --> 765.16
i thought i'd try that

765.62 --> 768.72
[Music]

785.92 --> 791.279
right so

788.0 --> 791.279
let's get this show

793.04 --> 795.68
kindled

794.399 --> 797.839
right

795.68 --> 798.959
because that's really how my show seemed

797.839 --> 800.9590000000001
to work

798.959 --> 803.1999999999999
happened yesterday too

800.959 --> 805.8389999999999
it's kind of funny right

803.2 --> 807.44
it's almost like we're all

805.839 --> 809.839
kindle

807.44 --> 812.1600000000001
and we're like yeah we're ready to burn

809.839 --> 815.6
but then like

812.16 --> 817.12
something has to kind of like

815.6 --> 820.24
get it going

817.12 --> 822.0
is weird because yesterday i got at a

820.24 --> 823.92
certain point like a little bit pissed

822.0 --> 825.68
off because everybody just kept silent

823.92 --> 826.8
in the chat and then it happens more

825.68 --> 828.399
often

826.8 --> 830.16
and it's almost like i need to get

828.399 --> 831.68
pissed off to kind of like create

830.16 --> 834.24
friction

831.68 --> 836.079
that then makes it start smoldering

834.24 --> 838.88
and then the fire gets going because the

836.079 --> 841.4399999999999
rest of the show after that was great

838.88 --> 843.8389999999999
and everybody was like really

841.44 --> 847.519
rolling

843.839 --> 850.519
it's just funny how these dynamics works

847.519 --> 850.519
work

854.38 --> 860.8
[Music]

858.72 --> 863.0400000000001
just walked into a [ __ ] show at work oh

860.8 --> 863.04
[ __ ]

864.16 --> 867.6
people bickering

865.92 --> 870.89
flatter sage

867.6 --> 874.049
that kind of a [ __ ] show

870.89 --> 874.049
[Music]

879.36 --> 884.6
moon looks really cool right now okay

881.279 --> 884.6
cana bear

885.76 --> 888.079
yeah the moon's been shining pretty

887.199 --> 890.079
bright

888.079 --> 893.959
over here as well

890.079 --> 893.959
in the night that is

902.959 --> 907.04
ah i forgot to get tea

905.6 --> 908.72
hey jello

907.04 --> 912.199
it's been a while

908.72 --> 912.1990000000001
good to see you

914.48 --> 917.549
[Music]

919.6 --> 925.24
right

920.72 --> 925.24
that's just gonna have to do like this

935.68 --> 938.079
oh

936.959 --> 940.2399999999999
clutter

938.079 --> 943.3599999999999
people in the oh right so it's like a

940.24 --> 946.24
bit of demoralization going on

943.36 --> 947.759
everybody's like there's a spirit of

946.24 --> 950.5600000000001
sloth hanging

947.759 --> 954.16
okay that's that's kind of annoying

950.56 --> 958.4799999999999
it is kind of easy by the way

954.16 --> 963.24
to do something about that if you

958.48 --> 963.24
if you can get to people somehow right

969.519 --> 973.519
i've seen that happen like to me that's

971.6 --> 975.519
almost like a sport

973.519 --> 977.12
because i hate sloth

975.519 --> 979.68
right

977.12 --> 983.839
if i'm in it i'm despicable

979.68 --> 983.8389999999999
i have been in that

995.279 --> 1000.049
as a teen that is

996.86 --> 1000.049
[Music]

1000.079 --> 1004.199
but

1000.959 --> 1004.199
oh man

1017.839 --> 1020.1600000000001
right

1022.079 --> 1025.36
out of nowhere

1023.6 --> 1028.16
right but

1025.36 --> 1030.6399999999999
yeah if i had energy and it had like its

1028.16 --> 1034.6000000000001
ups and downs i thought

1030.64 --> 1037.5200000000002
it was sort of identified by me and

1034.6 --> 1040.6399999999999
psychoanalysts on the surface

1037.52 --> 1041.839
as like manic depression type thing ups

1040.64 --> 1044.24
and downs

1041.839 --> 1046.6399999999999
sometimes i was like in just sloth and

1044.24 --> 1047.76
and really depressed

1046.64 --> 1050.5590000000002
like

1047.76 --> 1052.4
like frozen like i really like i don't i

1050.559 --> 1054.0
can't do anything

1052.4 --> 1057.039
and i don't want to do anything and i

1054.0 --> 1059.44
can't seem to change that right

1057.039 --> 1062.72
not that it was even super unpleasant

1059.44 --> 1065.039
physically it's just that it's just like

1062.72 --> 1065.9
standby mode and i couldn't turn it on

1065.039 --> 1068.72
really annoying

1065.9 --> 1072.16
[Music]

1068.72 --> 1074.72
and other times i was like really like

1072.16 --> 1076.24
like basically tripping

1074.72 --> 1079.44
from just

1076.24 --> 1081.039
my brain and inside and then like yeah

1079.44 --> 1083.1200000000001
everybody's like

1081.039 --> 1085.28
incompatible with that because they're i

1083.12 --> 1087.36
was just like psyche starting

1085.28 --> 1089.84
psychoanalyze people

1087.36 --> 1092.08
to me it was almost like yeah i'm an

1089.84 --> 1093.84
explorer in a jungle of creatures and

1092.08 --> 1095.1999999999998
i'm trying to understand these creatures

1093.84 --> 1098.08
here

1095.2 --> 1098.0800000000002
in a good way

1098.72 --> 1102.24
not

1099.52 --> 1102.78
yeah not as like with hostile intent or

1102.24 --> 1104.24
anything

1102.78 --> 1106.48
[Music]

1104.24 --> 1106.48
and

1106.96 --> 1113.2
yeah sometimes people would catch on to

1109.84 --> 1113.9189999999999
that and get annoyed by it or suspicious

1113.2 --> 1115.9
so

1113.919 --> 1119.0790000000002
mostly just kept it to myself

1115.9 --> 1119.0790000000002
[Music]

1119.52 --> 1123.36
and now i lost my point what's it gonna

1121.679 --> 1125.679
explain

1123.36 --> 1125.6789999999999
right

1126.48 --> 1130.24
what what typically happened while i was

1128.4 --> 1132.48
doing that i'm just like working or

1130.24 --> 1135.039
whatever listening and like being

1132.48 --> 1137.76
superficial hoping that what i'm do is

1135.039 --> 1140.0
gonna like inspire people because even

1137.76 --> 1142.64
if you see like super

1140.0 --> 1145.039
efficient energetic work

1142.64 --> 1148.5590000000002
for some people that like makes them

1145.039 --> 1149.6
like pull out of sloth and just like oh

1148.559 --> 1151.039
yeah

1149.6 --> 1152.8799999999999
yeah that's what we're supposed to do

1151.039 --> 1155.039
right

1152.88 --> 1157.8400000000001
sometimes other people would just like

1155.039 --> 1159.039
get caught up in conversations

1157.84 --> 1160.9599999999998
and then

1159.039 --> 1162.16
like out of nowhere i would just give

1160.96 --> 1164.4
them

1162.16 --> 1167.44
really details

1164.4 --> 1169.3600000000001
carefully formulated advice

1167.44 --> 1171.679
basically about the personal things that

1169.36 --> 1173.6
they were talking about thinking that

1171.679 --> 1175.039
they were just having that privately and

1173.6 --> 1177.039
then just getting kind of like

1175.039 --> 1178.96
professional level advice

1177.039 --> 1180.72
that will work great

1178.96 --> 1182.64
but sometimes people would be really

1180.72 --> 1184.799
offended and think like i was spying on

1182.64 --> 1188.24
them even though i'm basically

1184.799 --> 1188.24
like not that far away

1189.12 --> 1195.1999999999998
it's yeah

1190.72 --> 1195.2
so those are some of my work experiences

1196.0 --> 1199.919
post office in this case

1198.16 --> 1202.919
right

1199.919 --> 1202.919
it's

1208.64 --> 1211.679
but

1209.44 --> 1211.679
yeah

1212.0 --> 1218.24
if there's something that's like

1215.2 --> 1220.4
more like a group thing demoralizing

1218.24 --> 1223.039
if that's is that the case or is it just

1220.4 --> 1224.96
that everybody is kind of just

1223.039 --> 1226.96
tired of everything

1224.96 --> 1228.64
separately

1226.96 --> 1229.6000000000001
might just be one of those days where

1228.64 --> 1231.679
it's just

1229.6 --> 1233.4399999999998
everything goes wrong at the start with

1231.679 --> 1236.88
everybody

1233.44 --> 1236.88
and then they just get bogged down

1241.679 --> 1245.159
rv what

1253.07 --> 1256.6399999999999
[Music]

1259.84 --> 1266.599
people called out easter

1263.54 --> 1266.599
[Music]

1270.159 --> 1274.0390000000002
hello man on the edge

1278.64 --> 1284.7990000000002
yeah now in my opinion

1281.679 --> 1286.4
to use easter day to kind of just like

1284.799 --> 1289.52
complain

1286.4 --> 1290.88
like it's all conspiracy oh is

1289.52 --> 1293.36
uh

1290.88 --> 1295.5200000000002
look it's the devil sneaking in if

1293.36 --> 1298.02
that's like the thing that you're gonna

1295.52 --> 1300.24
be doing on easter day i'm like dude

1298.02 --> 1301.6
[Music]

1300.24 --> 1305.159
don't you know

1301.6 --> 1305.1589999999999
don't you knew

1305.44 --> 1310.4
like

1306.72 --> 1310.4
it's christ returning

1311.36 --> 1315.1999999999998
like

1312.48 --> 1317.6
esoterically like something is happening

1315.2 --> 1320.559
there's something happening

1317.6 --> 1321.76
in the spirit realm

1320.559 --> 1326.1589999999999
right

1321.76 --> 1328.799
energies like why do people and why do i

1326.159 --> 1330.3200000000002
why do we all become so sensitive in

1328.799 --> 1332.6399999999999
ways

1330.32 --> 1334.3999999999999
around that time

1332.64 --> 1337.2
a lot of people get

1334.4 --> 1339.8400000000001
like tooth issues really it's like not

1337.2 --> 1340.64
just me like the the dentist appears to

1339.84 --> 1342.8799999999999
be

1340.64 --> 1345.44
kind of crowded in this period for some

1342.88 --> 1347.6000000000001
reason it happens every year

1345.44 --> 1350.3200000000002
right i know this because my ex was the

1347.6 --> 1352.559
dentist i know that

1350.32 --> 1356.08
we discussed that

1352.559 --> 1357.44
it happens to me too and i'm just

1356.08 --> 1360.0
but then

1357.44 --> 1361.28
there's also when easter pretty much

1360.0 --> 1363.679
happens

1361.28 --> 1367.039
depending on your mindset

1363.679 --> 1369.6000000000001
you can have like this magical extra

1367.039 --> 1371.44
energy available to you for whatever for

1369.6 --> 1373.12
creativity

1371.44 --> 1375.8400000000001
for

1373.12 --> 1379.6789999999999
deep self-reflection

1375.84 --> 1381.06
for resolving higher complex spiritual

1379.679 --> 1382.5590000000002
issues about yourself

1381.06 --> 1384.799
[Music]

1382.559 --> 1387.9189999999999
good things or

1384.799 --> 1389.6
you can get like really twisted too and

1387.919 --> 1390.7990000000002
that's typical like

1389.6 --> 1393.6
there's like

1390.799 --> 1394.799
demons pop out of people too if they

1393.6 --> 1395.9189999999999
have them

1394.799 --> 1397.9189999999999
and they don't

1395.919 --> 1399.76
confront them right then that's the

1397.919 --> 1400.7990000000002
moment kind of that those freaking

1399.76 --> 1403.44
little

1400.799 --> 1406.6399999999999
bastards start to pop out in people and

1403.44 --> 1408.72
this is not just good trolls right that

1406.64 --> 1411.679
kind of do that all the time

1408.72 --> 1413.44
no that's like regular people

1411.679 --> 1415.919
have you noticed that

1413.44 --> 1417.039
that people in this period can certainly

1415.919 --> 1419.8400000000001
get like

1417.039 --> 1421.039
like really out of place dark about

1419.84 --> 1422.6399999999999
something

1421.039 --> 1424.08
have you noticed

1422.64 --> 1427.2
i kind of did

1424.08 --> 1430.84
yesterday right jeff gas head

1427.2 --> 1430.8400000000001
just out of nowhere

1434.24 --> 1436.799
it's okay

1437.12 --> 1441.1999999999998
because i blame it on that effect they

1440.159 --> 1442.4
sneak

1441.2 --> 1444.4
in

1442.4 --> 1446.3200000000002
it just kind of happens

1444.4 --> 1448.3200000000002
and if you just wander off and enjoy

1446.32 --> 1449.52
things then they'll still they'll still

1448.32 --> 1450.72
sneak in

1449.52 --> 1453.2
right

1450.72 --> 1455.3600000000001
it's like this period is like a tense

1453.2 --> 1457.3600000000001
period and if you're not like

1455.36 --> 1460.08
armoring yourself against all that

1457.36 --> 1462.3999999999999
spirit energy intensity then those

1460.08 --> 1464.24
freaking little demons sneak in

1462.4 --> 1465.279
so it's a time when i get a lot more

1464.24 --> 1468.4
strict

1465.279 --> 1468.4
with that high energy

1469.12 --> 1473.76
because it happens

1471.039 --> 1476.0
and then christ returns

1473.76 --> 1478.1589999999999
then suddenly

1476.0 --> 1481.279
the other side of it because it is like

1478.159 --> 1484.64
a spiritual tension in a way almost

1481.279 --> 1488.159
automatically invokes challenges

1484.64 --> 1491.3600000000001
in reflection to the receiver

1488.159 --> 1493.5200000000002
right it's like a spiritual challenge

1491.36 --> 1496.9599999999998
and then after that

1493.52 --> 1499.279
if you did right if you basically uphold

1496.96 --> 1500.559
the principles the spiritual principles

1499.279 --> 1502.64
of christ

1500.559 --> 1504.559
because it's like extra important to be

1502.64 --> 1506.48
very pure

1504.559 --> 1508.8799999999999
in that energy moment because it's so

1506.48 --> 1510.96
tense like the more tense that energy

1508.88 --> 1513.7600000000002
becomes the more important is to be

1510.96 --> 1515.76
really tight on the path in that moment

1513.76 --> 1517.679
as tight as you can

1515.76 --> 1520.72
like make extra effort right in that

1517.679 --> 1520.72
moment it's like you have to

1520.799 --> 1523.36
and then

1523.679 --> 1528.159
like

1524.88 --> 1530.88
well christ returns

1528.159 --> 1534.72
then like a miracle happens with that

1530.88 --> 1534.72
energy because you did it right

1535.12 --> 1540.559
and you get like a blessing

1537.84 --> 1543.6
it's amazing

1540.559 --> 1545.6
this yeah

1543.6 --> 1547.1999999999998
i just thought i'd like to reveal that

1545.6 --> 1550.1589999999999
to you guys

1547.2 --> 1552.4
that this has been my experience it's

1550.159 --> 1555.5200000000002
it's the magic of nature

1552.4 --> 1558.0
blessed be god

1555.52 --> 1560.96
for this incredible

1558.0 --> 1560.96
annual event

1568.84 --> 1573.6789999999999
right

1570.799 --> 1575.039
and i'm pretty sure that the darkness is

1573.679 --> 1577.679
aware of it

1575.039 --> 1580.799
and they face their challenges like they

1577.679 --> 1583.2
have to right the demon as i said if you

1580.799 --> 1584.6399999999999
put it out of your mind whatever that

1583.2 --> 1586.24
aspect is

1584.64 --> 1589.1200000000001
that's when the demons come sneaking in

1586.24 --> 1591.36
and the demons do not have your best

1589.12 --> 1592.2399999999998
interest at heart like

1591.36 --> 1594.9599999999998
that

1592.24 --> 1596.72
sneak demon that that that pops out of

1594.96 --> 1598.72
people even that normally don't have

1596.72 --> 1601.6000000000001
that

1598.72 --> 1604.32
they never do anything good for those

1601.6 --> 1605.1999999999998
people right

1604.32 --> 1607.039
so

1605.2 --> 1609.52
yeah the darkness is aware of it and

1607.039 --> 1612.0
they face challenges i bet on a personal

1609.52 --> 1615.52
level

1612.0 --> 1618.24
but for those that walk

1615.52 --> 1619.44
the esoteric path of christ very

1618.24 --> 1621.919
carefully

1619.44 --> 1623.919
not like super rigorously but at least

1621.919 --> 1626.3200000000002
with great awareness and just

1623.919 --> 1628.64
realization of what is actually

1626.32 --> 1630.32
happening in the energy in this map in

1628.64 --> 1632.0800000000002
these times

1630.32 --> 1633.6
they can

1632.08 --> 1634.58
use it

1633.6 --> 1636.48
to

1634.58 --> 1639.12
[Music]

1636.48 --> 1642.3990000000001
potentially go through like

1639.12 --> 1645.12
this is potentially if you know how to

1642.399 --> 1648.0
use spirit energy and am

1645.12 --> 1650.6399999999999
really wise and determined

1648.0 --> 1653.679
you can use it to basically

1650.64 --> 1656.5590000000002
get genius inside moments

1653.679 --> 1659.44
where you really find a way through to

1656.559 --> 1662.0
something that's like been weighing on

1659.44 --> 1662.0
you or

1662.159 --> 1666.7990000000002
indirectly on something that you care

1664.559 --> 1668.72
about for a long time

1666.799 --> 1670.57
isn't that interesting how it all comes

1668.72 --> 1674.88
together

1670.57 --> 1676.32
[Music]

1674.88 --> 1680.88
so

1676.32 --> 1680.8799999999999
some deep esoteric lessons here

1681.12 --> 1685.76
and it has to do with the time of the

1683.44 --> 1689.919
year

1685.76 --> 1692.64
like it doesn't not happen it never

1689.919 --> 1692.64
doesn't happen

1694.08 --> 1706.71
it happens every year

1696.96 --> 1706.71
[Music]

1710.72 --> 1715.3600000000001
right and i can imagine that with by

1713.36 --> 1719.6789999999999
that formula

1715.36 --> 1720.9599999999998
for x described it that people that have

1719.679 --> 1725.1200000000001
like

1720.96 --> 1726.159
typical sins sin problems like gluttony

1725.12 --> 1730.08
or

1726.159 --> 1732.88
any any other like like just drug abuse

1730.08 --> 1735.6
like escapement redirect

1732.88 --> 1737.7600000000002
confrontation escapism through drugs all

1735.6 --> 1741.039
those things that they will have a

1737.76 --> 1743.039
harder challenge too

1741.039 --> 1745.279
right i bet a whole bunch of people

1743.039 --> 1746.24
during easter times

1745.279 --> 1748.559
like

1746.24 --> 1751.1200000000001
that have gluttony issues or like

1748.559 --> 1753.36
chocolate addictions they constantly

1751.12 --> 1755.279
fall back during that time because there

1753.36 --> 1756.6399999999999
is suddenly like the chocolate eggs

1755.279 --> 1758.64
right

1756.64 --> 1761.279
it's really yeah but they are everywhere

1758.64 --> 1765.2
it's just chocolate suggestions

1761.279 --> 1765.2
at supermarkets and all that and

1765.6 --> 1769.12
and

1766.96 --> 1771.52
yeah then the calling suddenly comes

1769.12 --> 1773.4399999999998
because of the energy challenge

1771.52 --> 1776.6399999999999
spiritual energy challenge

1773.44 --> 1776.64
and then they fall back

1777.54 --> 1782.2
[Music]

1778.84 --> 1785.609
right and toothache issues in general

1782.2 --> 1785.6090000000002
[Music]

1788.32 --> 1791.32
anyway

1805.2 --> 1810.0800000000002
drinking this giant two and a half cup

1807.919 --> 1812.7990000000002
of hot chocolate

1810.08 --> 1815.84
okay canada bear

1812.799 --> 1817.6
trying to cut back on coffee

1815.84 --> 1820.1589999999999
that's wise

1817.6 --> 1822.48
i'm off coffee

1820.159 --> 1825.679
i have yeah i don't drink it anymore i'm

1822.48 --> 1829.76
i don't i've also lost the impulses

1825.679 --> 1829.76
but maybe that is part of it too

1830.559 --> 1836.32
maybe that's something that could be

1832.96 --> 1837.279
done too with easter time energy because

1836.32 --> 1839.039
of that

1837.279 --> 1841.76
compaction that

1839.039 --> 1844.08
if you're trying to get off something

1841.76 --> 1844.08
right

1844.88 --> 1849.8400000000001
but you keep like getting memories

1847.76 --> 1851.039
and you're like uh maybe i should maybe

1849.84 --> 1852.72
right

1851.039 --> 1855.12
well

1852.72 --> 1857.44
if you have been if you get bothered by

1855.12 --> 1860.6399999999999
those memories typically but you hold on

1857.44 --> 1862.64
pretty tightly like i'm not doing this

1860.64 --> 1864.64
and then

1862.64 --> 1866.64
like the easter energy comes you'll

1864.64 --> 1868.7990000000002
probably get more challenge more like oh

1866.64 --> 1870.5590000000002
come on come on

1868.799 --> 1872.799
you get these kind of like

1870.559 --> 1875.2
annoying little demons that sneak up a

1872.799 --> 1876.799
little closer to you really annoying

1875.2 --> 1879.76
right

1876.799 --> 1882.0
but if you then pull through without

1879.76 --> 1883.919
falling for it and basically get a

1882.0 --> 1886.64
little bit of agony from it on a

1883.919 --> 1888.96
spiritual level but you don't

1886.64 --> 1891.44
do it

1888.96 --> 1893.1200000000001
well what if and i think it is right

1891.44 --> 1896.72
that it happens that

1893.12 --> 1898.7199999999998
after that if when it goes down again

1896.72 --> 1901.76
there's a big chance that you like

1898.72 --> 1904.08
really lose those impulses after that

1901.76 --> 1904.08
point

1905.2 --> 1910.32
that it that it really goes away

1908.48 --> 1912.48
that you almost forgot that you ever did

1910.32 --> 1912.48
it

1915.84 --> 1920.8799999999999
yeah

1917.44 --> 1923.519
spiritual energy moments

1920.88 --> 1925.7600000000002
using it using it constructively

1923.519 --> 1926.96
productively

1925.76 --> 1929.44
this is

1926.96 --> 1931.6000000000001
this is my life's motto

1929.44 --> 1935.6000000000001
this is the mechanism that's basically

1931.6 --> 1937.519
prevented me from just becoming a wretch

1935.6 --> 1942.1589999999999
just a wretch

1937.519 --> 1944.72
is always using that principle

1942.159 --> 1947.8400000000001
it's like

1944.72 --> 1948.79
i industrialize

1947.84 --> 1952.32
spirit

1948.79 --> 1954.8799999999999
[Music]

1952.32 --> 1956.96
i just figure things out then i find

1954.88 --> 1959.919
ways to

1956.96 --> 1961.519
use it practically

1959.919 --> 1963.6000000000001
understanding

1961.519 --> 1966.799
utilization

1963.6 --> 1968.399
and with respect always balance always

1966.799 --> 1969.44
there

1968.399 --> 1972.76
right

1969.44 --> 1976.3200000000002
and the ups and downs a very important

1972.76 --> 1978.799
algorithmic understanding about it all

1976.32 --> 1980.72
always ups and downs is net you never

1978.799 --> 1984.48
deal with anything that's just perfectly

1980.72 --> 1984.48
constant with spirit mechanics

1985.6 --> 1989.76
i'm learning so much i hope you're

1987.84 --> 1992.24
learning with me

1989.76 --> 1993.84
and if you're not if it's a bit mystical

1992.24 --> 1996.159
to some of you

1993.84 --> 1998.399
then i bet that in the future

1996.159 --> 2001.0390000000002
you will get there and you will look

1998.399 --> 2003.6
back and you'll be like yeah man he was

2001.039 --> 2006.0
there early and now we're there

2003.6 --> 2008.399
you can be

2006.0 --> 2010.88
this strong

2008.399 --> 2013.76
with your understanding and the wisdom

2010.88 --> 2015.679
practically that it entails i'm i just

2013.76 --> 2016.72
happen to be really good at explaining

2015.679 --> 2020.3990000000001
it

2016.72 --> 2022.159
right this is part of my trait

2020.399 --> 2024.1589999999999
you don't have to be that good to

2022.159 --> 2028.3990000000001
explain it

2024.159 --> 2028.3990000000001
as long as you just get it inside

2029.919 --> 2034.88
and if you don't get it right away i

2031.84 --> 2034.8799999999999
have to trust that

2035.039 --> 2038.61
you want

2036.24 --> 2041.919
you will get it in the future

2082.879 --> 2086.44

2298.48 --> 2302.32
satan corrupted

2300.16 --> 2304.64
yeah but i don't see that though borders

2302.32 --> 2304.6400000000003
boy

2306.8 --> 2309.2000000000003
i mean

2309.359 --> 2314.0789999999997
like does that literally mean like a

2313.2 --> 2316.8799999999997
a

2314.079 --> 2318.48
blood sacrifice giving up for len or is

2316.88 --> 2320.079
that like

2318.48 --> 2321.44
some kind of

2320.079 --> 2323.92
pagan

2321.44 --> 2326.079
deity icon

2323.92 --> 2327.2000000000003
which they typically like to use that

2326.079 --> 2330.1600000000003
you

2327.2 --> 2332.8799999999997
reflect upon to like hey give up a bad

2330.16 --> 2335.52
habit isn't it what is that isn't that

2332.88 --> 2335.52
what it's about

2335.839 --> 2339.24
borders boy

2346.72 --> 2351.359
because that that would seem like good

2349.2 --> 2355.04
advice isn't that basically what i've

2351.359 --> 2358.64
just been saying through my

2355.04 --> 2360.8
yeah my spirit mechanics vernacular

2358.64 --> 2364.48
right

2360.8 --> 2364.48
so why would you say like oh

2366.96 --> 2371.68
like that i guess pagan

2369.68 --> 2372.3999999999996
thing of like giving up something for

2371.68 --> 2375.1189999999997
len

2372.4 --> 2377.76
why does why is that satan why is that

2375.119 --> 2379.119
automatically satan i don't get that

2377.76 --> 2383.5200000000004
like

2379.119 --> 2385.119
the idea that paganism is just satan is

2383.52 --> 2387.44
just evil

2385.119 --> 2389.2000000000003
makes no sense to me

2387.44 --> 2391.119
i think that that's

2389.2 --> 2394.0
like though that's the priesthood that

2391.119 --> 2395.44
is actually satan doing that

2394.0 --> 2397.76
through

2395.44 --> 2399.92
the yeah the corrupted christianity

2397.76 --> 2402.32
that's what i think

2399.92 --> 2404.48
right and the problem is is that

2402.32 --> 2405.44
if you just get marked like that all the

2404.48 --> 2407.599
time

2405.44 --> 2410.079
it's eventually gonna attract people

2407.599 --> 2412.1600000000003
that just wanna out of rebellious nature

2410.079 --> 2413.44
do that

2412.16 --> 2417.7599999999998
but it's just

2413.44 --> 2420.88
paganism a lot of it is just old wisdom

2417.76 --> 2423.44
and it it just doesn't involve christian

2420.88 --> 2424.56
iconography

2423.44 --> 2427.52
you see

2424.56 --> 2428.7999999999997
doesn't make it satan i totally disagree

2427.52 --> 2430.96
with that

2428.8 --> 2430.96
like

2431.359 --> 2436.48
the designer

2434.079 --> 2436.48
every

2437.28 --> 2442.96
i can

2439.119 --> 2445.599
like even or a diety type thing right

2442.96 --> 2447.119
like a pantheon

2445.599 --> 2449.44
those are all

2447.119 --> 2450.96
basically it's like a prism for the

2449.44 --> 2453.92
creator

2450.96 --> 2456.16
it creates it's all coming

2453.92 --> 2459.44
from the creator right whether you

2456.16 --> 2461.359
separate them as conflicting factions of

2459.44 --> 2463.52
energy and power

2461.359 --> 2465.5989999999997
it's still

2463.52 --> 2467.839
the creator really

2465.599 --> 2468.9700000000003
and i think that if a pagan truly

2467.839 --> 2471.44
realizes that

2468.97 --> 2473.9199999999996
[Music]

2471.44 --> 2475.68
this which is pretty heavy right

2473.92 --> 2477.2000000000003
and just

2475.68 --> 2479.5989999999997
then

2477.2 --> 2481.2799999999997
it's not blasphemy

2479.599 --> 2483.599
because in the end it's all about just

2481.28 --> 2486.079
the recognition of the ontological

2483.599 --> 2490.599
primitive nature

2486.079 --> 2490.599
of the predicament of our existence

2496.319 --> 2500.319
right

2497.76 --> 2502.079
so even people that are like oh yeah pan

2500.319 --> 2504.48
man pan

2502.079 --> 2507.119
like in that thing yeah well pan is

2504.48 --> 2508.09
described a lot of like naughtiness and

2507.119 --> 2509.44
deviancy

2508.09 --> 2511.119
[Music]

2509.44 --> 2512.64
right

2511.119 --> 2515.119
but

2512.64 --> 2518.48
technically it's still a fragment it's

2515.119 --> 2521.6800000000003
just that the bad traits are there right

2518.48 --> 2525.04
well god in his own

2521.68 --> 2527.359
design allows you to do those things

2525.04 --> 2529.92
and then they come with a price

2527.359 --> 2532.72
so it's up to the individual to choose

2529.92 --> 2534.8
is that what i resonate with is that

2532.72 --> 2537.2799999999997
what i choose

2534.8 --> 2539.3500000000004
are those the sins i choose

2537.28 --> 2541.6800000000003
is that where my frequency is

2539.35 --> 2544.48
[Music]

2541.68 --> 2546.96
and that's their choice

2544.48 --> 2549.04
and then they pay the price

2546.96 --> 2552.96
not through eternal damnation but

2549.04 --> 2555.119
through the direct response against the

2552.96 --> 2556.7200000000003
frequency

2555.119 --> 2559.2000000000003
the sin

2556.72 --> 2561.1189999999997
people deal with that everybody has

2559.2 --> 2563.2799999999997
something

2561.119 --> 2565.839
it's very rare to find somebody that's

2563.28 --> 2570.4
that's truly pure

2565.839 --> 2570.4
like untouched virgin pure that

2570.8 --> 2574.7200000000003
man

2572.079 --> 2577.44
in this age can you imagine that that's

2574.72 --> 2579.2
really tough to find

2577.44 --> 2580.64
like

2579.2 --> 2582.8799999999997
yeah

2580.64 --> 2582.8799999999997

2587.44 --> 2592.96
great show i linked it up here i don't

2589.92 --> 2595.76
hope i hope you don't mind

2592.96 --> 2598.4
you weren't here then

2595.76 --> 2602.5200000000004
but i linked up your show

2598.4 --> 2602.52
it was it was a lot of fun

2614.88 --> 2619.2000000000003
all right borders boy okay

2616.88 --> 2619.2000000000003
right

2619.599 --> 2624.839
instead of the fasting the gluttony yeah

2635.04 --> 2639.52
effectively

2637.76 --> 2641.3590000000004
right but it is basically still

2639.52 --> 2644.24
providing a surface and that is kind of

2641.359 --> 2647.2799999999997
what satan does

2644.24 --> 2649.359
i mean it's the people's choice

2647.28 --> 2651.92
now satan just makes the challenge a

2649.359 --> 2654.24
little bit more difficult that's what he

2651.92 --> 2654.2400000000002
does

2657.52 --> 2661.28
and in that sense like satan is like

2660.319 --> 2664.24
spirit

2661.28 --> 2664.2400000000002
of money

2664.72 --> 2668.0789999999997
that

2665.599 --> 2671.2000000000003
yeah that has interest in people's sin

2668.079 --> 2673.6800000000003
and that will like be there to provide

2671.2 --> 2677.0
for them when they do

2673.68 --> 2677.0
sin merchants

2727.92 --> 2730.92
hmm

2733.599 --> 2736.4
never heard of that

2742.16 --> 2748.319
gave up tobacco whiskey

2744.64 --> 2751.68
wow that's pretty epic

2748.319 --> 2751.68
tobacco is a tough one

2759.28 --> 2763.599
i gave up tobacco some time ago

2764.079 --> 2769.2000000000003
for quite a long time even and then

2766.9 --> 2772.64
[Music]

2769.2 --> 2772.64
yeah and then i fell back

2773.44 --> 2777.839
because like yeah my life broke part

2785.28 --> 2789.2400000000002
hey pjc net

2804.319 --> 2808.839
40 days

2805.839 --> 2808.839
interesting

2816.64 --> 2821.04
right

2818.0 --> 2821.04
so yeah maybe

2823.52 --> 2828.8
remember that story part

2826.0 --> 2833.68
where jesus was basically let on top of

2828.8 --> 2835.8390000000004
a mountain by satan and then like satan

2833.68 --> 2837.68
offered to give the world to him

2835.839 --> 2842.0
right remember that

2837.68 --> 2842.839
maybe that is kind of like esoterically

2842.0 --> 2846.96
the

2842.839 --> 2849.52
energy of what's happening during easter

2846.96 --> 2851.44
like maybe that is like

2849.52 --> 2853.68
a

2851.44 --> 2853.68
yeah

2855.119 --> 2860.7200000000003
a symbolic representation and maybe

2858.559 --> 2863.44
jesus himself

2860.72 --> 2865.359
experienced that like that would have

2863.44 --> 2866.7200000000003
been his

2865.359 --> 2869.2799999999997
dark world

2866.72 --> 2872.0789999999997
experience readout like the

2869.28 --> 2873.599
understanding of the moment and the

2872.079 --> 2875.28
energy

2873.599 --> 2878.96
i don't know this

2875.28 --> 2878.96
might be grabbing for straws here but

2879.76 --> 2883.44
yeah

2880.96 --> 2885.92
i really think it it means something and

2883.44 --> 2889.839
i'm i'm i'm going to do my best more and

2885.92 --> 2889.839
more to actually remember this

2890.64 --> 2904.81
because it is an annual occurrence

2894.3 --> 2904.8100000000004
[Music]

2921.44 --> 2926.52
carl sagan explaining aristotle's

2926.96 --> 2932.079
two minutes

2929.839 --> 2932.0789999999997
uh

2935.599 --> 2938.8
okay

2936.64 --> 2942.24
if it's just two minutes can you

2938.8 --> 2945.119
summarize it for me

2942.24 --> 2945.1189999999997
sensual goat

2947.359 --> 2951.52
quite a few parallels with jesus and

2949.119 --> 2951.52
buddha

2951.76 --> 2958.2400000000002
right well look flatter sage

2955.359 --> 2961.04
in some circles they're simply

2958.24 --> 2963.359
seen as the ascended masters

2961.04 --> 2965.44
so it's very logical that the ascended

2963.359 --> 2968.16
masters would have had

2965.44 --> 2970.8
the same experiences

2968.16 --> 2972.7999999999997
it's like that's what happens when you

2970.8 --> 2974.48
ascend

2972.8 --> 2979.04
right

2974.48 --> 2980.96
i've tried to describe this many a time

2979.04 --> 2983.2
the staircase and the higher you go the

2980.96 --> 2985.839
brighter your flame goes the narrower

2983.2 --> 2987.4399999999996
things the options become the more you

2985.839 --> 2989.2
see

2987.44 --> 2991.44
like walking a staircase up a mountain

2989.2 --> 2992.5589999999997
is just see more

2991.44 --> 2994.0
but then

2992.559 --> 2996.2400000000002
others see you

2994.0 --> 3000.24
and there will be more temptation from

2996.24 --> 3000.24
their side to take you down

3001.52 --> 3005.04
right

3002.72 --> 3007.7599999999998
the brighter the flame

3005.04 --> 3009.2799999999997
the more stark the contrast

3007.76 --> 3012.6400000000003
with the shadow

3009.28 --> 3013.3590000000004
and they come after you

3012.64 --> 3018.52
so

3013.359 --> 3018.52
that's just what happens when you ascend

3031.359 --> 3036.0789999999997
or buddha was jesus i should i don't

3033.2 --> 3036.0789999999997
think so no

3036.559 --> 3041.6400000000003
no i don't think they're the same

3038.64 --> 3041.64
individual

3048.72 --> 3052.16
maybe they were the same spirit

3051.28 --> 3054.2400000000002
in

3052.16 --> 3057.2799999999997
different pers people if you want to

3054.24 --> 3057.2799999999997
like separate

3058.079 --> 3063.119
that spirit or something i don't know

3060.64 --> 3065.44
maybe they had the unique

3063.119 --> 3068.48
that divine spark or something that

3065.44 --> 3072.079
people associate

3068.48 --> 3074.319
with the early ascended masters

3072.079 --> 3076.8
i don't think like yeah similar but

3074.319 --> 3079.839
that's not only christ and buddha like

3076.8 --> 3080.8390000000004
it's in other religions as well

3079.839 --> 3084.24
right and

3080.839 --> 3087.04
again every culture every region has

3084.24 --> 3090.5589999999997
their own type of rose colored darkly

3087.04 --> 3093.2
for their spirit and thus also a slight

3090.559 --> 3094.7200000000003
difference in what happens how they

3093.2 --> 3096.72
ascend how

3094.72 --> 3101.2799999999997
their branches grow

3096.72 --> 3101.2799999999997
as as they yeah how they form

3101.68 --> 3106.24
so not no none of them are going to be

3104.16 --> 3108.0789999999997
perfectly identical

3106.24 --> 3110.0789999999997
but they're all going to have strong

3108.079 --> 3112.7200000000003
similarities

3110.079 --> 3114.96
but to then say it has to be one like

3112.72 --> 3115.9199999999996
there can only be one

3114.96 --> 3117.599
ever

3115.92 --> 3119.52
that makes no sense

3117.599 --> 3122.7200000000003
why could there only be one like even

3119.52 --> 3125.04
jesus himself said like no no

3122.72 --> 3127.2799999999997
not the only one

3125.04 --> 3129.599
you're gonna be more that are even

3127.28 --> 3131.76
better

3129.599 --> 3131.76
so

3131.839 --> 3136.7999999999997
you know at some point you gotta let go

3134.48 --> 3138.8
of these

3136.8 --> 3140.7200000000003
priestly chains

3138.8 --> 3143.04
that have come with christianity for

3140.72 --> 3145.52
such a long time just gotta throw them

3143.04 --> 3148.839
off and just

3145.52 --> 3148.839
get real

3151.45 --> 3157.52
[Music]

3154.0 --> 3157.52
ashoka the great

3159.839 --> 3166.5589999999997
never heard of that terror 306

3163.119 --> 3168.48
but yeah there's many

3166.559 --> 3170.88
there's a lot of rich history when it

3168.48 --> 3175.319
comes to

3170.88 --> 3175.319
a lot of countries in the east

3185.119 --> 3190.1600000000003
probably would have been good friends if

3186.48 --> 3190.16
they were born around the same time yeah

3191.119 --> 3197.52
because i mean can you imagine

3194.48 --> 3199.599
from a carnal perspective like being

3197.52 --> 3201.52
like jesus or something

3199.599 --> 3203.3590000000004
i don't think you can i think think

3201.52 --> 3205.52
people just like to be like oh i want to

3203.359 --> 3208.0
be close to the love i want to

3205.52 --> 3210.559
oh jesus come in me right and they they

3208.0 --> 3213.599
just like wanna be him they idolize him

3210.559 --> 3217.2000000000003
they like think that oh i want to be

3213.599 --> 3219.76
him well guess what actually being jesus

3217.2 --> 3221.04
must have been like really

3219.76 --> 3223.44
solemn

3221.04 --> 3226.5589999999997
like even if you have people around you

3223.44 --> 3229.68
that like love you and worship you

3226.559 --> 3231.8390000000004
you constantly like have to like

3229.68 --> 3233.359
[Music]

3231.839 --> 3234.7999999999997
prevent them from

3233.359 --> 3237.2799999999997
going off

3234.8 --> 3239.2000000000003
from getting seriously seduced from just

3237.28 --> 3241.52
being in your presence

3239.2 --> 3244.319
it's going to be super isolating

3241.52 --> 3245.839
and also like you got this

3244.319 --> 3248.5589999999997
magnificent

3245.839 --> 3250.48
spiritual brilliance this perfected

3248.559 --> 3252.48
oversight

3250.48 --> 3254.0
to a degree compared to everybody's and

3252.48 --> 3256.319
like who are you gonna share it with

3254.0 --> 3259.599
it's a nightmare nobody really gets it

3256.319 --> 3261.7599999999998
you're always trying to just like

3259.599 --> 3265.76
turn it down a little so you can give

3261.76 --> 3268.4
something that they'll be like but

3265.76 --> 3269.6800000000003
you had to simplify it

3268.4 --> 3272.319
right

3269.68 --> 3275.359
so to find others like you is just like

3272.319 --> 3276.64
oh my god i'm not the only one thank god

3275.359 --> 3278.72
somebody that's

3276.64 --> 3280.4
that can get this

3278.72 --> 3282.8799999999997
and then you talk like

3280.4 --> 3287.119
freaking magicians like on the higher

3282.88 --> 3288.96
like maybe even unrecognizable language

3287.119 --> 3291.839
right

3288.96 --> 3294.0
that's how i imagined like yeah if jesus

3291.839 --> 3296.319
was alone just alone that would have

3294.0 --> 3299.04
been really sucky but if there were

3296.319 --> 3302.0
other ascended masters

3299.04 --> 3303.7599999999998
well it would only be logical if they if

3302.0 --> 3306.4
they sought each other out if they heard

3303.76 --> 3307.92
of one another right and as far as i'm

3306.4 --> 3310.9500000000003
concerned

3307.92 --> 3313.6800000000003
i heard jesus went to india

3310.95 --> 3316.96
[Music]

3313.68 --> 3316.96
after the crucifixion

3318.88 --> 3324.4
and there's even like so that's kind of

3321.92 --> 3326.16
close to buddha maybe they met up with

3324.4 --> 3329.119
buddha

3326.16 --> 3331.52
does anybody have any kind of clue

3329.119 --> 3334.799
maybe like a whole bunch of ascended

3331.52 --> 3337.599
masters came together in india like the

3334.799 --> 3337.599
super friends

3337.68 --> 3339.9199999999996
right

3340.079 --> 3342.4
and

3343.44 --> 3349.839
did a high council thing like

3346.24 --> 3349.839
what's the future of earth

3350.0 --> 3357.159
like what's gonna happen

3360.14 --> 3363.92
[Music]

3362.16 --> 3365.7599999999998
you see

3363.92 --> 3368.4
and maybe they got into a huge

3365.76 --> 3370.2400000000002
disagreement eventually

3368.4 --> 3371.76
because of their differences and like

3370.24 --> 3373.9199999999996
the responsibilities and they're like

3371.76 --> 3375.44
okay screw each other we're gonna go

3373.92 --> 3377.52
we're going home

3375.44 --> 3379.599
we're just going to do it our own way

3377.52 --> 3382.559
maybe that happened i don't know

3379.599 --> 3382.559
does anybody know

3384.64 --> 3389.52
i mean super high intellects like at

3387.2 --> 3392.24
first it's going to be like oh fresh air

3389.52 --> 3394.079
somebody that finally gets it but yet uh

3392.24 --> 3396.64
did we forget

3394.079 --> 3398.48
even in families oh we can communicate

3396.64 --> 3400.4
great because everybody's on the same

3398.48 --> 3402.319
level and like yeah others don't really

3400.4 --> 3403.6800000000003
get it

3402.319 --> 3405.04
guess who you're gonna to get into

3403.68 --> 3405.9199999999996
fights with

3405.04 --> 3407.7599999999998
right

3405.92 --> 3410.0
your freaking family

3407.76 --> 3411.0400000000004
because they always will get under your

3410.0 --> 3412.64
skin

3411.04 --> 3414.799
because they get you

3412.64 --> 3417.44
so that then becomes a problem why

3414.799 --> 3419.68
wouldn't that happen to ascended masters

3417.44 --> 3420.2400000000002
if they hung around each other too long

3419.68 --> 3422.799
right

3420.24 --> 3423.9199999999996
[Music]

3422.799 --> 3426.079
i mean

3423.92 --> 3428.88
it only seems natural

3426.079 --> 3428.88
to assume that

3429.52 --> 3434.48
like i'm not i'm not being frolicky

3431.839 --> 3436.4
about this this is just like logical

3434.48 --> 3439.04
conclusion stuff like they're still

3436.4 --> 3440.319
humans ascended masters are still human

3439.04 --> 3442.96
guys

3440.319 --> 3444.799
it's like oh they are the embodiment of

3442.96 --> 3446.42
god

3444.799 --> 3450.4
ugh

3446.42 --> 3452.319
[Music]

3450.4 --> 3455.52
they would have found all of that really

3452.319 --> 3457.599
tiresome probably even though yeah it's

3455.52 --> 3459.599
can be very convenient if people will

3457.599 --> 3460.88
just see you like a god and do what you

3459.599 --> 3462.96
say but

3460.88 --> 3464.799
then others will become jealous of that

3462.96 --> 3469.119
power that's just given to you by these

3464.799 --> 3469.119
people and yeah you know what happens

3470.24 --> 3473.24
uh

3502.24 --> 3505.2
yeah

3503.599 --> 3509.119
there's one thing that i wonder

3505.2 --> 3510.96
sometimes like if jesus actually did

3509.119 --> 3513.359
survive

3510.96 --> 3515.2
somehow which would be oh died and

3513.359 --> 3516.72
raised from the grape or he survived

3515.2 --> 3518.72
right it's pretty much the same it's

3516.72 --> 3519.52
damn miraculous i've said it a long time

3518.72 --> 3521.839
ago

3519.52 --> 3523.44
i don't mean blasphemy

3521.839 --> 3526.64
like him

3523.44 --> 3529.04
going through that and coming out alive

3526.64 --> 3531.839
is a miracle one way or the other

3529.04 --> 3531.839
but like

3532.559 --> 3537.28
did he after that point

3534.96 --> 3540.48
like wouldn't it only make sense that he

3537.28 --> 3543.2000000000003
actually did have children maybe a lot

3540.48 --> 3545.92
did he procreate

3543.2 --> 3550.3999999999996
after like in india like is there

3545.92 --> 3553.119
actually a pretty broad lineage of jesus

3550.4 --> 3556.0
where would have it all gone

3553.119 --> 3559.839
was he still fertile after that process

3556.0 --> 3562.0
of being well resurrected as we know it

3559.839 --> 3564.0789999999997
it

3562.0 --> 3567.52
yeah i know i'm kind of a weirdo right i

3564.079 --> 3567.52
ask those types of questions

3567.599 --> 3572.1600000000003
i'm sorry if that's like really weirding

3569.599 --> 3576.52
you out

3572.16 --> 3576.52

3788.96 --> 3792.0
so

3790.079 --> 3793.53

[ __ ]

3806.0 --> 3811.2

3808.48 --> 3815.44
and i i can't say like now that's just

3811.2 --> 3818.48
preposterous no no no it might just be

3815.44 --> 3818.48
it's just freaky

3819.68 --> 3822.319
yeah because of hunger starvation yeah

3821.359 --> 3824.96
but

3822.319 --> 3827.96

4170.64 --> 4175.279
okay ares 106 that's

4172.799 --> 4178.2789999999995
that's kind of a gamma entry of you like

4175.279 --> 4178.279
seriously

4192.48 --> 4196.5599999999995
i've actually had a lot to share

4195.04 --> 4200.84
today

4196.56 --> 4200.84
don't know if you picked up on that

4207.71 --> 4210.85
[Music]

4236.87 --> 4240.0
[Music]

4242.8 --> 4246.0
hey julio pavin

4244.4 --> 4249.48
it's been a while

4246.0 --> 4249.48
good to see you

4271.6 --> 4273.84
hmm

4277.52 --> 4284.4400000000005
right but yeah backs

4280.159 --> 4284.44
i guess it translates to mercy

4291.76 --> 4296.0
i think i've effectively been extremely

4294.239 --> 4298.239
merciful

4296.0 --> 4300.239
even though i am extremely intolerant as

4298.239 --> 4302.639999999999
well

4300.239 --> 4306.08
which seem

4302.64 --> 4310.6
like completely counter opposite

4306.08 --> 4310.6
but they don't have to be you see

4317.36 --> 4323.199
because

4318.719 --> 4323.199
intolerance effectively just makes you

4323.52 --> 4327.6
well on a personal level agitated

4325.36 --> 4329.5199999999995
perhaps but it will make you point

4327.6 --> 4330.4800000000005
things out

4329.52 --> 4333.1990000000005
right

4330.48 --> 4334.4
it's like you mercilessly point things

4333.199 --> 4335.44
out

4334.4 --> 4338.0
but then

4335.44 --> 4340.32
what are you going to do about it

4338.0 --> 4342.32
other than point it out

4340.32 --> 4344.799999999999
well that's where the top yeah that's

4342.32 --> 4346.4
where mercy then actually comes in just

4344.8 --> 4347.92
realizing like yeah

4346.4 --> 4349.44
like almost everybody's dealing with

4347.92 --> 4351.6
that that doesn't mean that you're just

4349.44 --> 4354.839999999999
gonna

4351.6 --> 4357.6
have to ruin everybody's life

4354.84 --> 4359.92
right the intolerance is really

4357.6 --> 4361.4400000000005
important to just point things out to

4359.92 --> 4365.6
not let

4361.44 --> 4365.599999999999
bad things slip by

4366.0 --> 4369.76
but it doesn't mean you have to like

4367.44 --> 4372.639999999999
exterminate bad things that's where

4369.76 --> 4372.64
mercy comes in

4372.719 --> 4378.159
right if you point things out then

4375.52 --> 4381.360000000001
you give an opportunity to the one

4378.159 --> 4381.36
you're pointing it out to

4382.96 --> 4387.6
you confront them

4385.6 --> 4389.52
that's what the intolerance really is

4387.6 --> 4392.88
for

4389.52 --> 4392.88
right confront

4393.12 --> 4396.5599999999995
give them a chance

4395.36 --> 4399.839999999999

for some reason biden is getting invited

like

4521.76 --> 4526.320000000001
past

4523.44 --> 4528.48
them over there

4526.32 --> 4529.36
the yeah the ukrainian government and

4528.48 --> 4532.48
their

4529.36 --> 4535.599999999999
constituents to actually just like kill

4532.48 --> 4537.599999999999
biden when he's there blow up or

4535.6 --> 4539.679
something and guess what blame it on the

4539.679 --> 4543.1990000000005
everything else

4541.92 --> 4544.4

4543.199 --> 4546.879999999999
yeah and

4544.4 --> 4549.839999999999
that would be a sufficient

4546.88 --> 4551.36
lit to defuse to actually get [ __ ]

4551.36 --> 4555.5199999999995

4572.08 --> 4576.08
why america isn't basically just like

4574.96 --> 4577.6
getting

4576.08 --> 4579.6

involved

5403.6 --> 5409.360000000001
yeah but yuri that's that's been an

5406.32 --> 5410.4
ongoing issue since the cold war right

5409.36 --> 5413.12
it's

5410.4 --> 5414.5599999999995
part of the basic agreement that ended

5413.12 --> 5416.639
that

5414.56 --> 5419.360000000001
nate no nato

5416.639 --> 5422.08
border states with russia

5419.36 --> 5423.36
and like there's no flexibility in that

5422.08 --> 5425.84
and just

5423.36 --> 5429.44
the rest of the world is like constantly

5425.84 --> 5431.68
whining like a bunch of annoying

just move on we're just gonna do it

5437.04 --> 5442.48

no you're not just going to do it anyway

5442.48 --> 5449.12
you stupid [ __ ]

5445.92 --> 5453.36
it's an agreement that's super rigid

5449.12 --> 5456.5599999999995
and you don't just go and do it anyway

5453.36 --> 5458.32
so just don't

5456.56 --> 5459.679
[ __ ] off

5459.679 --> 5464.88

5467.52 --> 5470.88

everything was all right until this

5489.36 --> 5494.96
stupid

5491.76 --> 5497.280000000001
gay-ass government got in there

5494.96 --> 5499.36
and basically started

5497.28 --> 5500.32
yeah

5499.36 --> 5502.88
like

5500.32 --> 5505.759999999999
threatening everything

5502.88 --> 5509.1990000000005
and then like oh we let's get nato like

5505.76 --> 5511.84
no you don't get nato

5509.199 --> 5514.719
that's literally like rigging yourself

5511.84 --> 5516.32
to like a suicide bomber like that's

5514.719 --> 5518.159
what this government

5516.32 --> 5521.04
in the last eight years have been doing

5518.159 --> 5525.5199999999995
rigging the country like a suicide

5521.04 --> 5529.04
bomber they're just there to destroy

5525.52 --> 5531.76
the ukrainian and russian people

5529.04 --> 5533.679
they're an outside destructive force

5531.76 --> 5535.6
they are not doing something for

5533.679 --> 5538.8
independence they're just trying to

5535.6 --> 5542.2390000000005
destroy everything you see

5538.8 --> 5543.4400000000005
vicious and evil and it needs to be

5579.28 --> 5585.28
yeah me too yuri

5582.159 --> 5588.96
then there's plenty it's just that

5585.28 --> 5590.239
they don't get paraded and showed

5588.96 --> 5592.56
right

5590.239 --> 5595.04
me part of what the media does now then

5592.56 --> 5596.639
because of the mass nature of it it's

5595.04 --> 5598.239
mass media it's not just a couple of

5596.639 --> 5600.88
media you know it's like media media

5598.239 --> 5603.36
many many many these millions and

5600.88 --> 5605.6
millions of speaking points echoing

5603.36 --> 5607.5199999999995
similar [ __ ]

5605.6 --> 5609.6
they show you

5607.52 --> 5611.040000000001
what they their target audience what

5609.6 --> 5612.8
they want

5611.04 --> 5615.36
people to think

5612.8 --> 5617.04
why because if you only show one side

5615.36 --> 5619.5199999999995
then a lot of people that are kind of

5617.04 --> 5621.84
like sheep they'll think that is it's

5619.52 --> 5625.84
the only side and that the other side is

5621.84 --> 5625.84
getting destroyed or is dying

5626.4 --> 5630.879999999999
it's mind control peer pressure on a

5628.4 --> 5633.199
very basic level so they just don't show

5630.88 --> 5634.719
you the people that don't agree they're

5633.199 --> 5635.919999999999
out there you might find them on social

5634.719 --> 5637.199
media they'll just say oh those are

5635.92 --> 5640.32
conspiracy

5637.199 --> 5643.678999999999
theorists or trolls or bots

5640.32 --> 5646.4
they're not real people or not relevant

5643.679 --> 5649.36
right they're just crazies

5646.4 --> 5650.48
but they aren't there is a whole range

5649.36 --> 5652.96
of people

5650.48 --> 5654.48
some of them are very smart very well

5652.96 --> 5658.56
studied

5654.48 --> 5660.879999999999
that know what's going on

5658.56 --> 5663.120000000001
but yeah you just don't get to typically

5660.88 --> 5665.36
see them

5663.12 --> 5667.84
unless you go dig right

5665.36 --> 5669.599999999999
you have to dig in the dirt

5667.84 --> 5673.74

5778.56 --> 5782.159000000001
right yeah yuri well

5783.679 --> 5788.2390000000005
sorry to be a bit of a stick in the mud

5785.52 --> 5790.719
here but don't get your hopes too much

5788.239 --> 5792.959999999999
up just yet you see

5790.719 --> 5795.04
there's a paradigm shift happening in

5792.96 --> 5799.0
world politics

5795.04 --> 5799.0
where basically there is

5799.32 --> 5803.28
authoritarianism slipping in and that

5801.76 --> 5805.360000000001
means that

5803.28 --> 5807.84
there's people in control of these

5805.36 --> 5812.32
western organizations

5807.84 --> 5813.92
compared to like russia or something

5812.32 --> 5816.88
that are really

5813.92 --> 5819.84
starting to lose all respect for the

5816.88 --> 5822.96
people like all the people

5819.84 --> 5825.119000000001
not just their political opponents

5822.96 --> 5825.119
so

5825.679 --> 5830.719
they don't care

5827.52 --> 5833.360000000001
if 50 of the people disagree with them

5830.719 --> 5834.2390000000005
they wouldn't care if 80 disagreed with

5833.36 --> 5836.239
them

5834.239 --> 5838.5599999999995
they are set in their ways they have

5836.239 --> 5839.678999999999
these plans worked out and they're just

5838.56 --> 5842.080000000001
doing it

5839.679 --> 5845.6
and they even showed it in advance and

5842.08 --> 5849.199
those plants go into absolute maniacal

5845.6 --> 5851.04
territory monstrous territory

5849.199 --> 5853.839999999999
and they've already said they're already

5851.04 --> 5854.639
saying like they're just going to do it

5853.84 --> 5856.639
so

5854.639 --> 5858.96
at this point it doesn't really matter

5856.639 --> 5863.679
that much for the course of what's about

5858.96 --> 5866.84
to unfold whether we all agree or not

5863.679 --> 5870.0
what does matter however within

5866.84 --> 5872.2390000000005
that whether we agree or not is our

5870.0 --> 5876.159
survival chances

5872.239 --> 5880.919999999999
right and any potential to actually

5876.159 --> 5880.92
stop it which is going to be tough

5882.96 --> 5887.04
it's like at this point like i don't

5885.199 --> 5889.04
know how

5887.04 --> 5891.84
really

5889.04 --> 5894.4
unless like just a massive amount of

5891.84 --> 5895.6
people are willing to just on the spot

5894.4 --> 5897.44
become

5895.6 --> 5899.76
militant

5897.44 --> 5900.879999999999
and literally take their governments

5899.76 --> 5902.719
down

5900.88 --> 5905.1990000000005
the the key functionaries and it's going

5902.719 --> 5907.44
to be very wide very wide because it's

5905.199 --> 5908.5599999999995
not just like a couple of politicians no

5907.44 --> 5910.638999999999
it's

5908.56 --> 5915.280000000001
the legal system

5910.639 --> 5915.28
is filled up with with their agents

5915.84 --> 5918.400000000001
as well

5917.199 --> 5920.879999999999
and they got all these business

5918.4 --> 5924.0
connections but it's mostly like yeah if

5920.88 --> 5927.04
you get the judges and the politicians

5924.0 --> 5928.88
but that requires like some level of

5927.04 --> 5932.48
manpower

5928.88 --> 5935.119
and yeah where's that gonna come from

5932.48 --> 5936.718999999999
in my view it like yeah

5935.119 --> 5939.119
it

5936.719 --> 5942.0
the most direct opportunity would be the

5939.119 --> 5944.88
citizenry but yeah they're all

5942.0 --> 5947.76
because of the compartmentalization away

5944.88 --> 5949.28
like your military or police or you're a

5947.76 --> 5952.0
citizen and then you don't really want

5949.28 --> 5954.0
to have anything to do with that

5952.0 --> 5956.0
makes it very tough and that's why we're

5954.0 --> 5958.4
almost like in this weird passivity

5956.0 --> 5960.8
still made situation it's been going for

5958.4 --> 5962.4
a long time or even those that are just

5960.8 --> 5964.8
calling it out

5962.4 --> 5967.199
kind of like myself or just like

5964.8 --> 5970.08
yelling and snarling like

5967.199 --> 5972.5599999999995
just do something

5970.08 --> 5975.04
but like nothing

5972.56 --> 5977.92
actually done it's just like a spiritual

5975.04 --> 5980.8
cold war and it's not moving

5977.92 --> 5981.76
but the enemy our enemy of the free

5980.8 --> 5985.52
people

5981.76 --> 5988.4800000000005
are abusing that stalemate and basically

5985.52 --> 5991.1990000000005
building a staircase on it

5988.48 --> 5995.119
and just go

5991.199 --> 5997.04
they're abusing this weird aberration of

5995.119 --> 6000.799999999999
passivity

5997.04 --> 6000.8
because of modern civilization

6001.52 --> 6006.4800000000005
and this is a systemic problem it's

6003.84 --> 6008.719
almost like they figured out how to win

6006.48 --> 6010.239
and i can't figure out how to beat them

6008.719 --> 6011.92
other than

6010.239 --> 6014.239
berserk

6011.92 --> 6017.4400000000005
controlled berserk

6014.239 --> 6019.44
give up everything and like really give

6017.44 --> 6020.48
up everything and don't start

6019.44 --> 6025.44
dick

6020.48 --> 6026.48
is crying and shitty like no like really

6025.44 --> 6028.239
gone

6026.48 --> 6030.879999999999
and you would have to have to have that

6028.239 --> 6033.839999999999
built up for a while

6030.88 --> 6036.719
you you would have had to had that

6033.84 --> 6038.8
fire lit for a while and prepare

6036.719 --> 6041.52
like if you haven't prepared half your

6038.8 --> 6041.52
life for this

6043.84 --> 6048.32
i don't know

6046.4 --> 6050.96
then we're gonna lose

6048.32 --> 6054.32
and the world is going to be a hell

6050.96 --> 6057.28
unrecognizable nothing will ever return

6054.32 --> 6059.92
to like the levels of life

6057.28 --> 6062.4
that we've known before this

6059.92 --> 6067.6
it will be a nightmare

6062.4 --> 6067.599999999999
and just only memories of guilt

6068.32 --> 6072.799999999999
that might become so bad that people

6070.88 --> 6075.1990000000005
will voluntarily

6072.8 --> 6078.08
snuff out their own minds

6075.199 --> 6080.4
just to survive

6078.08 --> 6080.4
okay

6081.119 --> 6085.92
and i've been extremely worried about

6083.84 --> 6088.400000000001
that for a long time because i just

6085.92 --> 6090.08
don't have trust like i'm not seeing

6088.4 --> 6092.5599999999995
these maneuvers there's

6090.08 --> 6094.719
like in some countries

6092.56 --> 6097.119000000001
i guess some places are not completely

6094.719 --> 6099.6
corrupted arguably

6097.119 --> 6101.28
and therefore like more populist as

6099.6 --> 6105.360000000001
their declared

6101.28 --> 6105.36
presidents get ahead like in hungary

6105.679 --> 6108.2390000000005
but

6107.36 --> 6110.239
that's

6108.239 --> 6112.159
is that actually going to change

6110.239 --> 6114.0
everything around right because the

6112.159 --> 6116.5599999999995
other places where that doesn't happen

6114.0 --> 6120.08
it it like can't happen

6116.56 --> 6121.92
because they're too infiltrated

6120.08 --> 6124.32
their legal systems have been too

6121.92 --> 6126.719
infiltrated for that to be able to

6124.32 --> 6129.199
happen at this point what do you the

6126.719 --> 6131.44
only thing you can do about that is just

6129.199 --> 6131.44
a

6131.76 --> 6135.08
a militant

6135.4 --> 6142.08
insurgency against that

6139.44 --> 6143.36
get the corrupt like sudden storming

6142.08 --> 6145.76
just like

6143.36 --> 6148.96
citizens arrest but like pretty heavy

6145.76 --> 6151.52
and just get them all

6148.96 --> 6154.56
get the people that are that are

6151.52 --> 6157.119000000001
keeping it corrupt

6154.56 --> 6158.88
and and quickly

6157.119 --> 6161.759999999999
but like how are you going to do that

6158.88 --> 6162.96
when like all the police forces and the

6161.76 --> 6165.119000000001
military

6162.96 --> 6168.4
which has been conditioned and rigged

6165.119 --> 6168.4
against those people

6169.119 --> 6175.44
like they're all waiting for somebody to

6171.679 --> 6178.32
do that but we have no choice the other

6175.44 --> 6179.5199999999995
choice is death the other choice is

6178.32 --> 6181.44
death

6179.52 --> 6183.84
what are you gonna do yeah everything

6181.44 --> 6187.28
they've done is to prepare

6183.84 --> 6191.56
against when anybody does that but the

6187.28 --> 6191.5599999999995
other choice is death

6193.89 --> 6204.400000000001
[Music]

6201.52 --> 6207.1990000000005
it's like this you're standing

6204.4 --> 6209.28
on like a plank of a ship

6207.199 --> 6212.239
right

6209.28 --> 6214.88
somebody is at

6212.239 --> 6216.48
like at on the ship on the other side of

6214.88 --> 6218.719
the plank

6216.48 --> 6221.839999999999
with a spear on it

6218.719 --> 6223.679
kind of pointing towards you

6221.84 --> 6225.6
if you walk back yeah you're pretty sure

6223.679 --> 6228.4
he's going to impale you

6225.6 --> 6229.76
but if you stay there

6228.4 --> 6232.0
like

6229.76 --> 6234.0
at some point you're gonna fall off the

6232.0 --> 6235.92
plank the ship's rocking and there's

6234.0 --> 6238.56
sharks down there like if you're just

6235.92 --> 6242.08
gonna stand there you know you're gonna

6238.56 --> 6245.679
fall off you're gonna die

6242.08 --> 6247.679
but you could take a risk at higher risk

6245.679 --> 6249.76
on the short run

6247.679 --> 6252.0
try to move towards the shore and like

6249.76 --> 6253.1990000000005
hope you can like push the spear aside

6252.0 --> 6255.44
or something

6253.199 --> 6257.599999999999
as you run towards there and then you

6255.44 --> 6259.04
might have a long-term chance right

6257.6 --> 6261.88
that's

6259.04 --> 6267.119
sort of the situation where we're at

6261.88 --> 6269.119
[Music]

6267.119 --> 6272.719
right it's not like there's a whole

6269.119 --> 6274.639
firing battalion with guns aimed at you

6272.719 --> 6277.199
waiting for you to jump right because

6274.639 --> 6279.52
then trying to get back is absolutely no

6277.199 --> 6282.239
chance at all but there's just a guy

6279.52 --> 6282.2390000000005
with a spear

6282.48 --> 6287.04
i mean yeah

6284.4 --> 6289.599999999999
i don't want to be impaled but i know if

6287.04 --> 6292.239
i keep standing on that plank in this

6289.6 --> 6294.56
rocky sea i am going to fall off and be

6292.239 --> 6295.839999999999
eaten by sharks which is pretty horrific

6294.56 --> 6297.52
[Music]

6295.84 --> 6300.8
so

6297.52 --> 6304.2390000000005
at some point you're just gonna have to

6300.8 --> 6306.400000000001
go through it risk overt death staring

6304.239 --> 6310.239
you right in the face

6306.4 --> 6312.08
and do something adrenal and dangerous

6310.239 --> 6314.638999999999
you just have to

6312.08 --> 6316.639
you just have to

6314.639 --> 6319.28
and it would be a more honorable death

6316.639 --> 6321.4400000000005
if that even means anything right to

6319.28 --> 6324.159
have tried and then get impaled and fall

6321.44 --> 6325.919999999999
down anyway

6324.159 --> 6329.5599999999995
it like

6325.92 --> 6329.56
what are you gonna do

6330.63 --> 6335.97
[Music]

6348.0 --> 6351.52
use

6349.04 --> 6353.119
climatic weapon

6351.52 --> 6355.280000000001
to distract

6353.119 --> 6356.96
you replace yeah yeah you're pretty

6355.28 --> 6360.0
right

6356.96 --> 6363.92
but they're already anticipated you see

6360.0 --> 6365.199
the awakening has been accounted for

6363.92 --> 6368.08
by them

6365.199 --> 6370.159
by the new world order

6368.08 --> 6372.4
they already know what's going to happen

6370.159 --> 6374.159
or what would have been happening thanks

6372.4 --> 6376.638999999999
to the internet they predicted that and

6374.159 --> 6380.159
they built on it

6376.639 --> 6383.6
right all they have to do is

6380.159 --> 6386.4
kind of let the awakening go its path

6383.6 --> 6389.280000000001
and not let anybody get too focused and

6386.4 --> 6392.08
basically burst out and

6389.28 --> 6395.5199999999995
and really change around things

6392.08 --> 6395.5199999999995
that's what they're focused on

6395.6 --> 6402.159000000001
they let the the awakened people do

6398.719 --> 6405.04
their thing but if they then go too

6402.159 --> 6406.719
powerful that's when they start striking

6405.04 --> 6409.5199999999995
that's when they suddenly

6406.719 --> 6412.639
start getting involved clamping down

6409.52 --> 6414.56
cutting down your resources

6412.639 --> 6415.84
your internet availability all that

6414.56 --> 6417.92
banning you

6415.84 --> 6421.84
all that

6417.92 --> 6425.04
it's when you like really break out

6421.84 --> 6425.04
actually break out

6427.36 --> 6432.88
so they're accounting for the awakening

6430.32 --> 6435.92
just awakening is not alone awakening is

6432.88 --> 6438.0
only the moment of realization

6435.92 --> 6440.56
why you have to take action really

6438.0 --> 6441.76
that's what it all eventually comes down

6440.56 --> 6444.080000000001
to that's

6441.76 --> 6445.679
the end point of the awakening

6444.08 --> 6447.84
because what use

6445.679 --> 6449.6
is knowing everything

6447.84 --> 6452.0
when there's nothing you can do about

6449.6 --> 6454.320000000001
your predicament

6452.0 --> 6454.32
right

6454.96 --> 6459.6
it's nothing but a a giant boulder

6458.0 --> 6462.159
on your shoulder

6459.6 --> 6463.679
while you're standing on a plank over

6462.159 --> 6467.5599999999995
the ocean

6463.679 --> 6467.56
at the edge of a ship

6487.28 --> 6489.599999999999
right

6495.6 --> 6500.0
but maybe it just requires a little bit

6497.76 --> 6501.679
more time

6500.0 --> 6504.159
i don't know maybe a whole bunch of

6501.679 --> 6504.159
bears

6504.4 --> 6509.119
are if like when their kids grow to a

6507.04 --> 6512.159
age where

6509.119 --> 6514.08
like they could take care of the house

6512.159 --> 6517.04
and the farm and all that and would be

6514.08 --> 6521.119
willing to that maybe then

6517.04 --> 6521.119
some of the bears would be like okay

6521.52 --> 6527.76
if i would die my family could survive

6525.44 --> 6528.799999999999
now i would actually

6527.76 --> 6531.119000000001
just get

6528.8 --> 6532.96
like now i'm available for actual

6531.119 --> 6535.119
militant duty

6532.96 --> 6536.88
to do what needs to be done maybe it

6535.119 --> 6539.599999999999
takes some more time

6536.88 --> 6541.92
right maybe a lot of bears

6539.6 --> 6543.76
bears don't want to pin this all on owen

6541.92 --> 6546.0
benjamin's community

6543.76 --> 6548.400000000001
in a broader sense

6546.0 --> 6550.4
maybe it requires more time before they

6548.4 --> 6551.679
all reach that point like yeah it's okay

6550.4 --> 6552.5599999999995
now

6551.679 --> 6555.1990000000005
like

6552.56 --> 6556.719
i can go away and then not be afraid

6555.199 --> 6558.5599999999995
that everything i tried to build up is

6556.719 --> 6560.719
just going to be destroyed

6558.56 --> 6562.56
right because that is a lot of the times

6560.719 --> 6565.199
what holds people back they're like

6562.56 --> 6567.52
afraid no if i go i want to go but if i

6565.199 --> 6568.5599999999995
go then everything falls apart that i've

6567.52 --> 6570.8
built

6568.56 --> 6573.280000000001
and i get that

6570.8 --> 6576.320000000001
that's part of the reason why you should

6573.28 --> 6578.239
be getting children while you build

6576.32 --> 6580.32
and then hopefully those children at

6578.239 --> 6583.04
some point age enough

6580.32 --> 6585.199
and are motivated naturally

6583.04 --> 6587.28
to kind of take that over to take over

6585.199 --> 6588.159
the responsibilities of your house while

6587.28 --> 6590.32
you

6588.159 --> 6593.679
could actually

6590.32 --> 6596.08
perform your militant duty

6593.679 --> 6599.08
right i hope this makes sense to

6596.08 --> 6599.08
everybody

6601.24 --> 6604.5
[Music]

6620.0 --> 6623.48
yeah well goalie

6624.719 --> 6628.08
if they're still like you can't make

6626.96 --> 6629.84
people

6628.08 --> 6632.0
see things you you know that right

6629.84 --> 6634.639
goalie

6632.0 --> 6637.119
if you're using that as some kind of a

6634.639 --> 6639.04
escape ticket it's not working because

6637.119 --> 6641.92
yeah there's always going to be people

6639.04 --> 6644.96
that will absolutely no matter what

6641.92 --> 6644.96
refuse to get it

6645.199 --> 6649.04
and when the time comes and their life

6646.88 --> 6652.4800000000005
depends on it they could probably

6649.04 --> 6654.48
perfectly act like they would get it but

6652.48 --> 6657.119
then as soon as the danger is over they

6654.48 --> 6658.239
will forget about it again because some

6657.119 --> 6659.119
people

6658.239 --> 6662.48
don't

6659.119 --> 6666.4
want to get it and they can get it but

6662.48 --> 6668.959999999999
they refuse to get it you see

6666.4 --> 6671.04
you can't force people to ascend

6668.96 --> 6673.44
you can only give them the opportunity

6671.04 --> 6675.599
to do it

6673.44 --> 6680.5599999999995
and there will always be people no

6675.599 --> 6683.28
matter what that just won't get it

6680.56 --> 6685.280000000001
and right now we happen to be in an era

6683.28 --> 6687.04
where a lot of people don't get it

6685.28 --> 6689.92
because they don't need to get it to

6687.04 --> 6691.679
survive and that's why they hold on to

6689.92 --> 6696.159
not getting it

6691.679 --> 6696.159
and you can never make them get it

6697.28 --> 6704.08
because she just can't do that doesn't

6699.599 --> 6704.08
work like that that's not how ascension

6706.84 --> 6713.76
works ah right yeah there's a live show

6709.76 --> 6713.76
i see a link now from nathan

6714.32 --> 6721.0
and i'm oh time's flown

6716.639 --> 6721.0
i'm gonna have to run out the show soon

6721.9 --> 6725.978999999999
[Music]

6733.199 --> 6736.08
okay goalie mckernan i guess that you're

6735.04 --> 6738.719
not

6736.08 --> 6740.88
a cleaner

6738.719 --> 6742.56
cleaner

6740.88 --> 6744.639
professionals

6742.56 --> 6747.679
often get on their knees

6744.639 --> 6747.679
know from experience

6749.36 --> 6753.92
all right but yeah dying on your feet

6752.56 --> 6756.0
for what

6753.92 --> 6757.28
right for what are you gonna die in your

6756.0 --> 6759.28
feet

6757.28 --> 6760.96
proud that you didn't give in to

6759.28 --> 6764.719
something

6760.96 --> 6766.96
but you didn't actually stop it either

6764.719 --> 6768.08
right why would you be proud of that i

6766.96 --> 6770.4800000000005
mean

6768.08 --> 6773.28
be glad you didn't give in to it and

6770.48 --> 6774.5599999999995
make the problem worse

6773.28 --> 6777.28
but if you

6774.56 --> 6779.119000000001
just not participating is not really

6777.28 --> 6781.28
something that i think you should be

6779.119 --> 6784.08
really proud of in this time

6781.28 --> 6786.08
i mean it doesn't really take that much

6784.08 --> 6787.599
not to be part of it

6786.08 --> 6788.639
just have to have a little bit of

6787.599 --> 6791.92
character

6788.639 --> 6794.400000000001
but it's not resolving anything you see

6791.92 --> 6797.04
the darkness the new world order

6794.4 --> 6801.04
is still winning despite that

6797.04 --> 6801.04
so should you really be proud of that

6802.8 --> 6806.119000000001
it's a question

6807.599 --> 6810.719
not participating

6813.76 --> 6818.320000000001
well because

6815.119 --> 6821.04
you basically said like yeah

6818.32 --> 6822.5599999999995
just the imagery die on your feet like

6821.04 --> 6824.48
how

6822.56 --> 6826.080000000001
when they're gonna get you

6824.48 --> 6828.718999999999
because it all went out of control and

6826.08 --> 6830.96
nobody did anything including you

6828.719 --> 6833.92
to actually stop it

6830.96 --> 6837.199
passivity is not going to stop it it's

6833.92 --> 6837.1990000000005
taken into account

6837.84 --> 6841.52
you have a plan

6839.28 --> 6843.28
okay

6841.52 --> 6848.040000000001
all right well that's good

6843.28 --> 6848.04
i'm not gonna criticize you for that

6856.0 --> 6860.679
okay land always sounds like a plan

6863.28 --> 6868.0
it's hard to stop a moving train yeah

6864.88 --> 6868.0
but it's not impossible

6875.52 --> 6880.400000000001
could russia stop

6877.44 --> 6880.4
the new world order

6880.88 --> 6885.52
i think russia is actually

6883.679 --> 6889.1990000000005
the key

6885.52 --> 6891.84
to breaking the current new world order

6889.199 --> 6891.839999999999
yes

6897.62 --> 6900.849999999999
[Music]

6902.239 --> 6908.08
right that doesn't mean that whatever is

6904.0 --> 6910.08
gonna come in its place is gonna be

6908.08 --> 6912.159
a lot better

6910.08 --> 6914.32
but it's gonna be somewhat better at

6912.159 --> 6917.32
least

6914.32 --> 6917.32
right

6920.88 --> 6923.4400000000005
i mean

6921.76 --> 6928.76
everything's gonna have to be better

6923.44 --> 6928.759999999999
than absolute total death

6949.84 --> 6953.360000000001
china is the biggest key no china is

6952.32 --> 6958.04
their own

6953.36 --> 6958.04
their they have their own breakaway plan

6960.08 --> 6966.0
and yes the new world order current

6962.719 --> 6970.08
faction is using them

6966.0 --> 6972.719
but china involves in everything

6970.08 --> 6976.4
but they are their own thing

6972.719 --> 6978.96
and they're not nice like the idea that

6976.4 --> 6981.44
china would literally that their party

6978.96 --> 6983.679
would be in control of everywhere

6981.44 --> 6986.239
is a giant nightmare

6983.679 --> 6987.28
but i don't think they even really want

6986.239 --> 6989.839999999999
that

6987.28 --> 6989.84
literally

6994.639 --> 6998.8
i mean they've never actually engaged in

6997.679 --> 7001.8
wars

6998.8 --> 7001.8
right

7003.679 --> 7009.36
not in a direct sense

7005.44 --> 7011.36
to just do economic psychological

7009.36 --> 7013.839999999999
and trade wars

7011.36 --> 7016.48
that's what they do but like

7013.84 --> 7018.8
direct military action

7016.48 --> 7020.879999999999
i don't think so

7018.8 --> 7022.320000000001
and i hope they keep it that way because

7020.88 --> 7025.119
that's

7022.32 --> 7028.159
probably the reason their empire

7025.119 --> 7030.96
is one of the oldest empires

7028.159 --> 7032.239
undefeated unconquered empires in world

7030.96 --> 7034.639
history

7032.239 --> 7037.119
because they never did actually engage

7034.639 --> 7037.119
in war

7037.199 --> 7042.0
and i really hope they stick to that

7039.04 --> 7045.36
