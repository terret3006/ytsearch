429.0 --> 433.569
ah

430.44 --> 433.569
[Music]

436.44 --> 442.08
right yeah the whole Indonesian style

440.22 --> 443.94000000000005
meal

442.08 --> 446.94
that I've now had for three days has

443.94 --> 450.12
been great yeah I'm done with it but

446.94 --> 452.699
still my digestion session is just

450.12 --> 455.84000000000003
having some trouble

452.699 --> 455.84000000000003
with some of it

457.139 --> 460.639
but it's been great though

461.759 --> 465.56
it's really good to have just a

466.08 --> 469.139
decent meal

467.46 --> 471.9
meal like that again

469.139 --> 473.699
brings back so many memories too because

471.9 --> 475.79999999999995
it's like

473.699 --> 477.72
my dad used to make it and it's like

475.8 --> 479.94
typically from his side of the family

477.72 --> 482.14000000000004
because I do still kind of have a side

479.94 --> 484.319
of that family there

482.14 --> 485.88
[Music]

484.319 --> 488.819
uh

485.88 --> 492.3
yeah like my my grandmother from my

488.819 --> 492.3
dad's side like

492.78 --> 498.5
and like one of her last my last visits

495.96 --> 498.5
to her

500.039 --> 506.94
like I made this meal specifically for

503.4 --> 509.039
her what was it yeah it was because like

506.94 --> 511.74
her boyfriend

509.039 --> 516.0
that she's been with for for a long time

511.74 --> 520.38
had died and we were like there to

516.0 --> 523.86
to give her like a warm family hug

520.38 --> 527.1
what it was the dish called well it's

523.86 --> 528.9590000000001
Kip ketchup basically with some ball

527.1 --> 534.2
bunches

528.959 --> 534.1999999999999
is just basically a lot of ginger

534.779 --> 540.059
that's really the primary ingredient

537.02 --> 540.059
[Music]

542.04 --> 545.66
so it's just some rice

545.7 --> 549.5400000000001
some

547.86 --> 551.88
um

549.54 --> 555.18
green beans

551.88 --> 557.899
with some ball and in some coconut oil

555.18 --> 557.899
and some

559.56 --> 564.9799999999999
little Snippets of onion and you just

561.54 --> 568.0799999999999
let it sit there and soak it in

564.98 --> 569.1
and then yeah of course the main thing

568.08 --> 571.8000000000001
is

569.1 --> 574.1
take chicken

571.8 --> 577.38
the little blocks

574.1 --> 579.12
uh everything in little blocks I I do it

577.38 --> 580.68
like that with this meal everything it

579.12 --> 582.54
goes in little blocks so there's like

580.68 --> 585.12
ginger root cut it in little blocks

582.54 --> 587.16
garlic cut it in a little block so I'm

585.12 --> 590.7
going to talk a little it's like

587.16 --> 592.92
two three millimeter across cubes

590.7 --> 595.44
roughly

592.92 --> 598.4399999999999
onions

595.44 --> 599.7600000000001
and

598.44 --> 602.7600000000001
yeah

599.76 --> 604.92
like a bit of olive oil normally you do

602.76 --> 608.22
it all with olive oil but I also add on

604.92 --> 610.9799999999999
coconut oil because it's just good

608.22 --> 613.62
but still a little regular oil or it'll

610.98 --> 616.019
like completely solidify every time it

613.62 --> 618.6
dries off and that's a little annoying

616.019 --> 621.3
right uh

618.6 --> 624.0
and then yeah you add on just more taste

621.3 --> 626.88
so a little bit of vinegar

624.0 --> 630.12
apple vinegar for the sourness

626.88 --> 631.68
some ginger syrup for the sweetness

630.12 --> 634.38
ketchup

631.68 --> 637.16
salt version

634.38 --> 637.16
uh

641.54 --> 649.019
and maybe some coconut sugar like all on

645.3 --> 652.38
the beans right so that's roughly it uh

649.019 --> 655.16
just decided rice dish on top of that

652.38 --> 657.959
maybe some crab chips

655.16 --> 660.66
and well because it's kind of low

657.959 --> 661.92
vegetables besides the beans I tend to

660.66 --> 665.06
end like this

661.92 --> 668.8389999999999
like this just this fruit is typical

665.06 --> 668.8389999999999
Asian fruity stuff

671.04 --> 675.54
so yeah

673.019 --> 678.42
and that's like it's basically very

675.54 --> 680.8199999999999
typical Indonesian meal

678.42 --> 683.459
although I think that the Indonesians

680.82 --> 684.9590000000001
typically do use pig meat instead of

683.459 --> 687.8
chicken

684.959 --> 687.8
and I don't

687.959 --> 693.7199999999999
uh yeah

690.54 --> 697.579
it's basically sweet sour pork

693.72 --> 701.0600000000001
remember from Shady walk from South Park

697.579 --> 701.06
it's kind of that

701.279 --> 704.66
but a different for Ryan

705.3 --> 711.24
and I made this yeah it took me three

708.0 --> 713.519
hours though three hours Non-Stop

711.24 --> 716.12
it's a lot of work but it yeah it really

713.519 --> 716.12
pays off

717.12 --> 723.32
pays off even more if there's other

719.459 --> 723.3199999999999
people to join in but yeah

724.8 --> 730.38
hey LSG good to see you

811.74 --> 814.7
for three days

816.0 --> 821.04
but I'm gonna be glad to like move to my

818.88 --> 823.75
more regular food staple because that

821.04 --> 825.42
just digests better

823.75 --> 828.079
[Music]

825.42 --> 828.079
uh

829.32 --> 835.1

1008.3 --> 1012.74

1010.699 --> 1016.06
finished up watching on Benjamin

1012.74 --> 1016.0600000000001
a Saturday stream

1017.12 --> 1020.98
that was one of the things that I

1018.62 --> 1020.98
watched

1023.959 --> 1028.24
so that time seems to elude me a bit

1032.24 --> 1037.78
oh man

1033.799 --> 1037.78
man that's so freaking cold

1079.1 --> 1082.1

[Music]

1106.539 --> 1111.679
thanks for that Reno but yeah I did a

1109.46 --> 1113.179
recent unban so all the trolls have to

1111.679 --> 1118.01
come by

1113.179 --> 1121.0590000000002
okay that you're one of them bye

1118.01 --> 1121.059
[Music]

1129.82 --> 1134.32
hey turret let's see you

1138.46 --> 1146.66
hello getting sick

1141.919 --> 1150.8600000000001
the humidifier yeah that's cool I guess

1146.66 --> 1153.3200000000002
uh it wouldn't really work here

1150.86 --> 1155.4799999999998
it's way too much and by the way yeah I

1153.32 --> 1159.76
leave the

1155.48 --> 1159.76
the window open a lot anyway so

1189.86 --> 1192.86
foreign

1198.7 --> 1202.539
no why do you think that

1209.059 --> 1214.059
they're just the regular flatter debate

1211.64 --> 1214.0590000000002
trolls

1221.12 --> 1224.12
foreign

1229.24 --> 1234.039
yes that's the reason why so many trolls

1234.32 --> 1240.3799999999999
I basically unleash them all

1237.98 --> 1242.179
after I noticed that just like nobody

1240.38 --> 1244.64
was talking at the beginning of my show

1242.179 --> 1246.3200000000002
at all and I got kind of pissed so I was

1244.64 --> 1248.6000000000001
like oh okay well if you guys are not

1246.32 --> 1250.8799999999999
gonna talk then the trolls are gonna

1248.6 --> 1254.3799999999999
talk

1250.88 --> 1254.38
and that's how that happens

1270.32 --> 1276.62
not regulars yeah yeah no yeah I mean

1273.679 --> 1279.02
Owen has a different class of trolls

1276.62 --> 1284.8999999999999
that go after him

1279.02 --> 1287.059
because whoa our life's practicality

1284.9 --> 1289.76
the difference between me and Owen is

1287.059 --> 1292.1589999999999
quite enormous so

1289.76 --> 1294.679
it's just those trolls are not

1292.159 --> 1296.3600000000001
interested in me

1294.679 --> 1298.7
and the trolls that come after me

1296.36 --> 1302.6789999999999
probably can't watch Owen Benjamin

1298.7 --> 1302.679
because they would become too envious

1303.5 --> 1310.49
it would just hurt too much

1307.26 --> 1310.49
[Music]

1310.64 --> 1315.8200000000002
oh when it's on Rockford yeah but Owen

1312.679 --> 1315.8200000000002
is on all kinds of places

1321.74 --> 1325.72
a flutter Sage good to see you

foreign

1756.32 --> 1759.6399999999999
kids series

1767.44 --> 1773.059
well yeah I guess it's like kind of team

1770.179 --> 1774.44
compatible or something but

1773.059 --> 1776.47
series

1774.44 --> 1780.13
I'm not sure

1776.47 --> 1780.13
[Music]

1786.38 --> 1791.779
right but I did appreciate just the lack

1788.96 --> 1793.64
of sexuality in it and

1791.779 --> 1795.799
and

1793.64 --> 1800.419
there was like in the whole thing there

1795.799 --> 1801.98
was like one one gay little thing

1800.419 --> 1806.0590000000002
and that's like

1801.98 --> 1807.679
this bee guy had two moms that's like

1806.059 --> 1810.02
they're old and they didn't even do

that gregories are you talking about

1898.76 --> 1901.299

huh

1928.46 --> 1932.8990000000001
I had no idea

1930.32 --> 1935.98
he managed to hide that like in his

1932.899 --> 1935.9799999999998
videos pretty well

1939.14 --> 1942.14
hmm

2015.179 --> 2021.22
ER said she's been like well sort of the

2019.12 --> 2024.76
number one

2021.22 --> 2029.44
video guy they had for years

2024.76 --> 2029.44
I mean he makes really intense

2029.679 --> 2036.22
relatively short videos that play a lot

2032.98 --> 2037.8990000000001
on the Infowars so and it was always

2036.22 --> 2040.08
kind of impressed with what he puts

2037.899 --> 2040.08
together

2041.44 --> 2046.48
but I was always wondering like uh is he

2044.62 --> 2050.1389999999997
is he

2046.48 --> 2053.5
kind of like an agent

2050.139 --> 2056.159
but apparently he's into Flat Earth even

2053.5 --> 2056.159
openly

2056.56 --> 2064.659
so that was completely unexpected

2061.06 --> 2066.82
I mean the open part I mean

2064.659 --> 2069.099
I had some suspicions he would probably

2066.82 --> 2071.94
know about it because he seems like a

2069.099 --> 2071.94
very smart man

2073.659 --> 2078.659
but I never expected he would openly

2075.76 --> 2078.659
talk about that

2079.69 --> 2082.849
[Music]

2083.159 --> 2088.9190000000003
okay well I can

2085.599 --> 2088.9190000000003
link you to it

2100.32 --> 2107.56
he literally has his own sub Channel

2105.4 --> 2110.32
at band.video

2107.56 --> 2112.54
so yeah I'll link you to that and then

2110.32 --> 2114.7200000000003

2112.54 --> 2114.72

way

3249.599 --> 3255.42
it was this weird video from a long time

3252.059 --> 3256.92
ago okay so this is not a new thing a

3255.42 --> 3261.27
long time ago

3256.92 --> 3262.619
like early 2000s or something

3261.27 --> 3265.74
[Music]

3262.619 --> 3269.339
where there's literally some guy in a

3265.74 --> 3273.839
little mini car driving by some

3269.339 --> 3277.14
uh yeah some field and then literally

3273.839 --> 3279.96
gets surrounded by a circle of sheep

3277.14 --> 3281.8799999999997
that just like circles around them but

3279.96 --> 3284.4
really fast and like he can't get away

3281.88 --> 3286.7400000000002
because the Sheep's just encircle his

3284.4 --> 3287.56
car all of a sudden have you ever seen

3286.74 --> 3290.7599999999998

that Circle of horses in the middle of

3301.319 --> 3305.359
the city that was really weird

3325.74 --> 3329.9399999999996
um right anyway guys yeah I'm I'm sorry

3328.44 --> 3333.859
to disappoint you but I'm gonna round

3329.94 --> 3333.859
out because I'm just not feeling great

3334.559 --> 3339.42
it's just gonna be me kind of staring at

3336.72 --> 3342.14
the chat going back and forth downstairs

3339.42 --> 3342.14
and

3343.079 --> 3349.02
I'm just gonna try to recover and take

3346.619 --> 3352.339
part in the Flat Earth debates

3349.02 --> 3352.339
and then just

3353.72 --> 3359.339
take clean up and get better so that

3357.24 --> 3362.4799999999996
tomorrow I'm not gonna be as wonky I'm

3359.339 --> 3362.48
really sorry about that

3363.44 --> 3367.8
I thought that I would be able to

3365.88 --> 3370.26
recover properly but it's just not

3367.8 --> 3373.38
happening I mean

3370.26 --> 3375.6600000000003
after halfway the show I still feel kind

3373.38 --> 3379.1600000000003
of the same

3375.66 --> 3379.16
it's just not a good thing

3379.68 --> 3385.5
I feel yeah because for an indication of

3383.28 --> 3389.3
what it feels like I feel lucky that I

3385.5 --> 3389.3
haven't accidentally thrown up yet

3389.76 --> 3394.8590000000004
it's just that tension again

3392.04 --> 3396.72
and when I don't sleep properly that

3394.859 --> 3399.359
tension becomes like a little bit more

3396.72 --> 3403.7
than I can typically handle

3399.359 --> 3403.7
so that's basically what I call wonky

3404.28 --> 3409.619
right but anyway yeah I'm gonna round

3407.579 --> 3413.8390000000004
out properly though

3409.619 --> 3413.839
no no no no no I don't need anything

3413.94 --> 3420.42
no more things down the hatch

3417.78 --> 3423.1800000000003
not until like this wonkiness is gone

3420.42 --> 3425.4
I'm gonna take a shower and some

3423.18 --> 3427.2
power nap and hopefully that'll do the

3425.4 --> 3430.2000000000003
trick

3427.2 --> 3432.18
