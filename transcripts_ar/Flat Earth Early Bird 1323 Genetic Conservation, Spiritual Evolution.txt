6.12 --> 37.42
[Music]

85.68 --> 89.36000000000001
morning

87.28 --> 91.36

123.6 --> 129.039
like to have some paypal donation

127.439 --> 131.039
this every show

129.039 --> 133.76
that would make me

131.039 --> 136.55999999999997
a lot happier anyway

133.76 --> 138.959
so the weather today is turned around

136.56 --> 138.959
again

139.84 --> 143.84
it's so clouded up

145.28 --> 148.4
like what a contrast

151.36 --> 154.84
it's still very warm though

154.0 --> 159.599
and

154.84 --> 159.599
moist so it's one of those days

159.92 --> 164.79999999999998
but yeah yesterday was a lot of blue

162.56 --> 167.84
clear skies

164.8 --> 171.76000000000002
the trails did persist they kept on

167.84 --> 174.239
going until eventually it did really

171.76 --> 177.519
to start to cover

174.239 --> 179.59900000000002
the skies in like a blanket of it

177.519 --> 181.76
and i guess that's

179.599 --> 183.83999999999997
that persisted throughout the night

181.76 --> 186.0
because now it's this

183.84 --> 187.12
also it seems to be raining here and

186.0 --> 188.879
there

187.12 --> 190.239
according to the weather report although

188.879 --> 192.79999999999998
i haven't

190.239 --> 195.519
had a single drop of rain

192.8 --> 198.519
where i'm at yet

195.519 --> 198.519
so

201.519 --> 206.72
hello gadget inspector first in chat

204.08 --> 206.72
good to see you

210.4 --> 216.68
it is thursday the 4th

212.799 --> 216.68
of august 2022

231.599 --> 234.79899999999998
no into

238.72 --> 242.64
huh

240.879 --> 244.959
welcome to the flat earth early bird

242.64 --> 244.95899999999997
show

245.28 --> 250.64000000000001
trying to rain here

247.2 --> 250.64
did not last long right

253.2 --> 256.56
yeah i bet in france it's a little it

255.599 --> 257.59999999999997
warp

256.56 --> 259.68
if i

257.6 --> 262.96000000000004
remember correctly from your report

259.68 --> 264.56
yesterday it was really hot so yeah even

262.96 --> 268.0
when it rains then it's just gonna

264.56 --> 271.28000000000003
evaporate very quickly

268.0 --> 271.28
well here not so much

275.759 --> 279.84000000000003
yeah it's 26 degrees celsius

280.88 --> 286.08
just in a way it is really remarkable

283.199 --> 288.08000000000004
that it can be that warm

286.08 --> 291.08
when there's just no sun coming through

288.08 --> 291.08
whatsoever

308.56 --> 313.84
although looking around there are a

310.88 --> 315.759
couple of patches of clear blue skies

313.84 --> 317.75899999999996
still in between

315.759 --> 320.24
the giant cloud bag that seems to be

317.759 --> 323.56
right over there over there

320.24 --> 323.56
there is

324.96 --> 330.0
the other side of the building there is

326.56 --> 330.0
some clear blue anyway

333.039 --> 336.68
lost moretz

338.24 --> 341.84000000000003
he did not think what would work

351.52 --> 354.24
the font

355.52 --> 358.08
what do you mean

359.44 --> 362.759
what fun

368.96 --> 372.23999999999995
i'm not seeing any

370.72 --> 374.8
bumps

372.24 --> 377.759
alteration status reds i have no idea

374.8 --> 377.759
what you're talking about

377.84 --> 381.919
look at your first comment what first

380.639 --> 383.12
comment

381.919 --> 385.75899999999996
i don't see

383.12 --> 388.0
your first comment except for holy crap

385.759 --> 391.8
i did not think that would work

388.0 --> 391.8
that's your first comment

394.08 --> 397.84
right

395.52 --> 397.84
this is

404.479 --> 409.24
never mind yeah don't worry about it

429.759 --> 435.12
i've been like cooking last

433.28 --> 438.31899999999996
yeah yesterday

435.12 --> 440.56
it was it was just too warm

438.319 --> 443.28000000000003
it was really annoying it was so warm

440.56 --> 445.199
that like even at one o'clock at night i

443.28 --> 446.88
was still sitting here

445.199 --> 447.68
with like

446.88 --> 451.36
the

447.68 --> 455.36
the tube fan thing just to blow some air

451.36 --> 455.36
on me because it was just too hot

455.68 --> 460.24
so

456.56 --> 463.44
i'm lucky to even have slept any

460.24 --> 465.28000000000003
at all this night

463.44 --> 466.879
i guess that eventually just cooled down

465.28 --> 468.79999999999995
enough for me to just

466.879 --> 472.72
be able to sleep properly but it was

468.8 --> 472.72
just so freaking warm yesterday

474.08 --> 477.08
uh

478.0 --> 483.12
[Music]

479.36 --> 483.12
flatters debates was great

483.84 --> 490.08
wasn't a super long show

486.4 --> 492.479
but the show that was there was great

490.08 --> 495.919
i really hope nathan's gonna do a

492.479 --> 495.919
four more hour show today

497.599 --> 502.28
because we're all in good form

513.12 --> 516.12
um

520.56 --> 523.919
sorry guys it's just

530.959 --> 539.3599999999999
there were a whole bunch of videos out

535.519 --> 539.36
made by jimbo had a live show

539.839 --> 545.08
that's where i got inspired for the name

541.68 --> 545.0799999999999
for the show

551.2 --> 553.44
uh

561.279 --> 566.8
mr cheswick has a like he uploaded three

564.72 --> 568.8000000000001
different videos one was about

566.8 --> 571.76
the globe maker

568.8 --> 571.76
it was hilarious

574.72 --> 579.12
it's just funny i mean like that's a

577.2 --> 581.36
that's an interesting skill

579.12 --> 583.76
that he built

581.36 --> 587.279
of course this is just a rip from some

583.76 --> 590.399
documentary about well bloat maker

587.279 --> 593.4399999999999
from a non-flat earth perspective

590.399 --> 596.08
but yeah mr cheswick uploaded it and it

593.44 --> 596.08
is funny

598.08 --> 601.6800000000001
also

599.04 --> 602.959
checked out brian's logic video for a

601.68 --> 607.04
bit

602.959 --> 609.1199999999999
didn't hang around for too long

607.04 --> 613.279
but i just looked like through the

609.12 --> 613.279
comments and holy [ __ ]

616.32 --> 620.8000000000001
like brian really gets the anti-flat

618.959 --> 623.4399999999999
earthers going

620.8 --> 625.92
like they're all commenting

623.44 --> 625.9200000000001
all of them

626.48 --> 633.24
see ruiff in there

629.519 --> 633.24
professor phil

637.68 --> 643.4399999999999
a whole bunch of typical

639.76 --> 646.4399999999999
troll names that i recognize

643.44 --> 646.44
uh

649.44 --> 655.2790000000001
makes me feel good

651.44 --> 658.0790000000001
to not have a comment section anymore

655.279 --> 660.64
it's also pointless

658.079 --> 664.16
in all of this [ __ ] that they say it's

660.64 --> 667.68
pretty much all straw man all of it

664.16 --> 670.24
unbelievable or just not related

667.68 --> 672.4799999999999
brian is a troll magnet yeah

670.24 --> 675.64
yeah he is

672.48 --> 675.64
a lot

676.079 --> 680.079
it's just the way he he talks

684.24 --> 687.04
it's

685.36 --> 688.9590000000001
it's like

687.04 --> 690.56
because of the combination of just who

688.959 --> 693.1199999999999
he is like

690.56 --> 694.3199999999999
that he is a bit of like a math nerd and

693.12 --> 696.24
all that

694.32 --> 698.5600000000001
he's really smart but also that he's

696.24 --> 701.44
irish and he is very typically irish and

698.56 --> 703.5189999999999
when you combine that it just

701.44 --> 705.519
it's like a leprechaun with a pot of

703.519 --> 707.839
gold to these anti-flat earthers they

705.519 --> 710.8
just can't help it

707.839 --> 713.6800000000001
they're all drawn in

710.8 --> 713.68
how dare you

713.92 --> 717.8389999999999
hey pgcnef good to gets you

727.44 --> 731.44
so yeah brian

729.04 --> 734.3199999999999
definitely draws in

731.44 --> 737.839
all the typical

734.32 --> 739.6800000000001
online anti-flat earthers me not so much

737.839 --> 741.12
but that's because i don't get very

739.68 --> 744.0
technical

741.12 --> 746.16
i just do spirit mechanics esoteric

744.0 --> 748.48
psychology

746.16 --> 751.12
social engineering

748.48 --> 753.279
fractal thinking

751.12 --> 756.639
and yeah that's

753.279 --> 759.519
nobody's studied in that field in order

756.639 --> 761.76
to start building an ego and then

759.519 --> 764.24
bragging like oh irwin got it all wrong

761.76 --> 767.8389999999999
because this is literally

764.24 --> 767.839
pretty much an unwritten field

768.639 --> 773.5600000000001
i'm in the middle of exploring it

775.839 --> 780.5600000000001
a5 roads brian slays yeah

783.76 --> 787.519
it's funny because underneath it he

785.44 --> 789.9200000000001
definitely like has the nathan oakley

787.519 --> 789.92
method

790.48 --> 795.44
like i am much more like oh just play

793.279 --> 798.24
around i'm just like a cat like oh you

795.44 --> 800.5600000000001
don't have to kill the mouse right away

798.24 --> 802.32
you know you might not even have to kill

800.56 --> 803.92
it you just

802.32 --> 805.2
entertain yourself there's plenty of

803.92 --> 807.1999999999999
mice

805.2 --> 809.0400000000001
don't have to kill it and nathan

807.2 --> 810.72
oakley's always just like

809.04 --> 812.959
dead

810.72 --> 816.72
and brian is really

812.959 --> 816.7199999999999
kind of like that as well

821.76 --> 824.0
oh

827.519 --> 832.8
dear oh dear let go look at what we have

830.48 --> 832.8000000000001
here

833.839 --> 837.1990000000001
uh i gotta read this out

835.76 --> 840.24
because this is the type of shitty

837.199 --> 843.279
comments that ryan typically does get

840.24 --> 846.5600000000001
it's those like it's the ones

843.279 --> 849.68
that always like to join

846.56 --> 852.4799999999999
and try to get in his face

849.68 --> 854.7199999999999
so don't confuse sci-fi in reality which

852.48 --> 857.32
is a good it's a good thing that's

854.72 --> 861.36
actually a good name

857.32 --> 863.9200000000001
unfortunately like most flat earthers

861.36 --> 866.9590000000001
brian speaks with great confidence on

863.92 --> 868.8389999999999
subjects he doesn't understand

866.959 --> 871.279
yeah well from a

868.839 --> 874.32
legal linguistic

871.279 --> 875.8389999999999
perspective you're correct he doesn't

874.32 --> 878.88
understand

875.839 --> 881.2790000000001
because he knows it's [ __ ]

878.88 --> 884.16
there's no reason to understand things

881.279 --> 886.639
which are provably false and based on

884.16 --> 888.959
presuppositions

886.639 --> 888.9590000000001
huh

889.04 --> 893.36
so yeah

890.959 --> 895.5999999999999
he does speak with great confidence in

893.36 --> 899.12
subjects he doesn't understand because

895.6 --> 902.399
he comprehends it

899.12 --> 903.839
yet will not be tricked

902.399 --> 906.32
into

903.839 --> 907.839
falling in line

906.32 --> 911.1600000000001
semantically

907.839 --> 911.1600000000001
or legally

913.12 --> 918.48
you've never come yeah but don't need to

915.519 --> 921.6
is what every this is what they all do

918.48 --> 921.6
it's what they all do

922.079 --> 927.8389999999999
unfortunately lol yeah five routes like

924.959 --> 929.92
i wonder if this guy even realizes the

927.839 --> 932.48
fractal implications of what he wrote

929.92 --> 934.639
down he probably didn't mean it like

932.48 --> 936.5600000000001
that

934.639 --> 939.92
i'm gonna take it like that though

936.56 --> 942.399
that's why it's so hilarious reading it

939.92 --> 945.8389999999999
because when i read it

942.399 --> 948.56
i might be reading it in a way

945.839 --> 950.32
that he hadn't thought of as he was

948.56 --> 952.8389999999999
writing it down

950.32 --> 955.279
isn't that just

952.839 --> 957.9200000000001
hysterical right you're seeing it too

955.279 --> 957.92
five roads

959.519 --> 966.759
hey stallion 8012

961.839 --> 966.759
am i doing today doing good

969.839 --> 976.9590000000001
it's a bit

971.199 --> 976.959
bit swampy because it's hot and moist

977.44 --> 982.1990000000001
oh goody sun is coming through again

982.32 --> 987.759
there's so little winds i missed the

984.079 --> 987.7589999999999
wind the wind was just great

988.399 --> 991.199
i want it back

994.48 --> 998.639
because yeah now i can have all the

996.72 --> 1001.6800000000001
doors open and everything is nothing no

998.639 --> 1001.6800000000001
grease coming through

1012.24 --> 1015.839
okay gadget inspector

1016.079 --> 1019.199
yeah yeah yeah

1022.88 --> 1027.28
well it's only really the tall ones

1025.039 --> 1027.28
right

1027.919 --> 1033.76
i mean

1029.36 --> 1036.839
the tall ones are like pretty amazing

1033.76 --> 1039.12
but yeah when you get the tiny ones the

1036.839 --> 1041.36
irish that's when you get all the

1039.12 --> 1044.6789999999999
grabbler traits that's when they turn

1041.36 --> 1044.6789999999999
into leprechauns

1052.32 --> 1057.039
right

1054.559 --> 1060.08
i bet you are not as tall as brian

1057.039 --> 1060.08
gadget inspector

1060.24 --> 1066.28
you don't act like that

1063.28 --> 1066.28
sorry

1085.039 --> 1092.52
you're eight foot tall right

1088.64 --> 1092.5200000000002
i don't believe it

1098.32 --> 1100.559
no

1106.72 --> 1111.96
that's probably more in the direction of

1108.64 --> 1111.96
four foot

1135.84 --> 1137.9189999999999
you

1164.559 --> 1169.36
right okay well you're obviously not

1166.96 --> 1169.3600000000001
taking

1170.0 --> 1176.4
any actual stance for your height so i

1173.28 --> 1176.3999999999999
probably called it

1177.679 --> 1181.1200000000001
i mean i'm not the tallest guy in the

1179.6 --> 1183.6
world i'm like

1181.12 --> 1183.6
average

1183.76 --> 1188.32
i think i'm like

1185.52 --> 1191.12
5.7

1188.32 --> 1193.6
but i think that you're probably

1191.12 --> 1196.4799999999998
smaller than me otherwise you you would

1193.6 --> 1198.799
have been a lot more specific

1196.48 --> 1200.96
and not just joked around and that's

1198.799 --> 1204.52
fine

1200.96 --> 1204.52
i mean i would

1206.88 --> 1214.96
i mean there's entire like movie careers

1210.72 --> 1217.76
around people that just always

1214.96 --> 1220.24
like their trait is to make them seem

1217.76 --> 1222.559
taller than they really are in real life

1220.24 --> 1224.48
like their entire career which could be

1222.559 --> 1225.9189999999999
like 50 years

1224.48 --> 1228.48
or something

1225.919 --> 1230.159
it's like oh they're always just filmed

1228.48 --> 1233.039
in a way and they have stands and so

1230.159 --> 1235.8400000000001
that they look taller because it matters

1233.039 --> 1235.84
matters to them

1238.08 --> 1241.039
six foot two

1241.27 --> 1244.359
[Music]

1247.52 --> 1250.559
i'm not buying it

1259.44 --> 1264.0800000000002
i cut off height to be a leprechaun is

1262.48 --> 1266.72
three

1264.08 --> 1266.72
foot nine

1268.24 --> 1274.159
how much is that actually like

1272.08 --> 1277.6
half a meter

1274.159 --> 1280.3200000000002
no that's way too big for a leprechaun

1277.6 --> 1283.039
i mean a real leprechaun is more like

1280.32 --> 1285.52
rogan size right

1283.039 --> 1287.28
i think that the official

1285.52 --> 1290.6399999999999
like the

1287.28 --> 1292.32
intuitive cut off length for an actual

1290.64 --> 1294.72
leprechaun

1292.32 --> 1296.799
or a gnome you could say right it is

1294.72 --> 1298.88
really like gnome class that's the

1296.799 --> 1300.48
leprechaun size wise

1298.88 --> 1304.8400000000001
would be

1300.48 --> 1304.84
about three foot

1305.12 --> 1308.799
i mean they are really small

1313.76 --> 1317.4
i mean the only

1318.0 --> 1323.6
class smaller would literally become a

1321.2 --> 1323.6000000000001
fairy

1326.96 --> 1331.3600000000001
right or a smurf or something like that

1329.76 --> 1334.64
so

1331.36 --> 1334.6399999999999
then we're talking inches

1336.88 --> 1342.88
how tall is ryan i think brian is

1340.64 --> 1342.88
like

1343.52 --> 1346.84
i don't know

1347.52 --> 1354.24
he's somewhere in the sixth foot

1350.72 --> 1354.24
he actually is a tall one

1358.32 --> 1363.1589999999999
he is a pretty tall lad yeah

1385.12 --> 1387.6789999999999
yeah yeah

1386.32 --> 1388.559
five foot seven

1387.679 --> 1391.76
so

1388.559 --> 1395.84
is he that's my height

1391.76 --> 1395.84
i mean that's not even that small

1396.88 --> 1401.679
but i guess that's he just wants to be a

1399.36 --> 1404.08
big ass giant i mean i don't blame him

1401.679 --> 1404.0800000000002
you know

1404.48 --> 1408.72
[Music]

1407.12 --> 1411.4399999999998
like especially if you're a movie star

1408.72 --> 1412.72
like you want to be a big giant if

1411.44 --> 1414.559
you're especially if you're like an

1412.72 --> 1415.679
action star so

1414.559 --> 1418.72

1415.679 --> 1418.72
sylvester stallone

1418.88 --> 1423.8400000000001
of course tom cruise most most famous

1421.84 --> 1427.12
for that

1423.84 --> 1427.12
and they're bound to be others

1427.36 --> 1432.32
but i'm like yeah i'm totally

1430.0 --> 1434.32
like i'm not even gonna point and laugh

1432.32 --> 1436.8799999999999
at you for that

1434.32 --> 1438.72
i mean if you make if you're just a

1436.88 --> 1440.72
badass character in a movie and you

1438.72 --> 1443.039
really pull it off i don't care if

1440.72 --> 1446.159
you're actually tricking us all

1443.039 --> 1448.48
by standing on a box with your acting

1446.159 --> 1451.72
you're doing a great job and that's much

1448.48 --> 1451.72
more important

1460.76 --> 1466.64
1.88 nice

1464.08 --> 1466.6399999999999

1475.039 --> 1478.36
just know

1490.799 --> 1495.279
i mean could you please maybe

1493.679 --> 1497.279
start

1495.279 --> 1501.84
blabbering about things that actually

1497.279 --> 1504.64
have a point instead of random

1501.84 --> 1506.799
like dude are you drunk again gadget

1504.64 --> 1508.88
inspector you sound like you're not

1506.799 --> 1512.9189999999999
entirely uh

1508.88 --> 1512.919
mentally fit right now

1514.72 --> 1518.64
yeah

1515.679 --> 1518.64
this is [ __ ]

1518.96 --> 1522.64
yeah i actually watch

1521.36 --> 1524.559
his shows

1522.64 --> 1526.0800000000002
gadget inspector

1524.559 --> 1528.96
if something like that would be

1526.08 --> 1531.1999999999998
happening i would be the one to tell you

1528.96 --> 1531.2
that

1538.32 --> 1544.6399999999999
so i'd appreciate it if you stop

1540.72 --> 1547.52
spreading spreading false rumors

1544.64 --> 1551.8100000000002
to me that would be great great gadget

[Music]

1584.48 --> 1589.76
no gadget inspector

1586.559 --> 1589.76
that makes no sense

1597.36 --> 1601.9189999999999
or or maybe he is literally just

1599.6 --> 1603.36
committing harry kerry or something i

1601.919 --> 1605.039
don't know

1603.36 --> 1607.1999999999998
i heard that he did go to court i

1605.039 --> 1608.48
haven't actually seen what he said there

1607.2 --> 1610.88
i'm not gonna

1608.48 --> 1613.52
listen to a word he says look

1610.88 --> 1615.2
he could effectively at this point just

1613.52 --> 1619.679
blatantly

1615.2 --> 1620.72
lie like overtly lie

1619.679 --> 1623.76
to that

1620.72 --> 1626.24
court that is not a court and that so

1623.76 --> 1628.96
far has like violated all court

1626.24 --> 1631.76
procedures like to an international

1628.96 --> 1634.48
level it is absolutely absurd so

1631.76 --> 1636.559
maybe alex is like okay i'm getting

1634.48 --> 1639.44
[ __ ] over i might as well just

1636.559 --> 1641.9189999999999
gaslight this [ __ ] out of the situation

1639.44 --> 1646.0
maybe that's what he's doing okay

1641.919 --> 1646.0
because his store is not closing

1646.32 --> 1649.52
like no it isn't

1647.919 --> 1653.0
it's still gonna go

1649.52 --> 1653.0
it's still going

1654.96 --> 1660.64
maybe yeah

1657.919 --> 1662.64
maybe indeed maybe

1660.64 --> 1666.24
saying

1662.64 --> 1668.96
oh he's gonna sell off his products

1666.24 --> 1670.32
is completely baseless he didn't say

1668.96 --> 1672.3990000000001
that

1670.32 --> 1674.399
even from what you've said i can already

1672.399 --> 1677.039
conclude that he didn't say anything

1674.399 --> 1679.039
even close to that so you literally made

1677.039 --> 1680.0
it up and then just reified it on the

1679.039 --> 1683.399
spot

1680.0 --> 1683.399
like a drunk

1684.399 --> 1688.0
he says

1685.36 --> 1690.6399999999999
100 yeah he's just cocking he's just

1688.0 --> 1693.279
letting them rape him for some [ __ ]

1690.64 --> 1695.76
idiots idiotic reason

1693.279 --> 1697.84
totally idiotic i don't know what the

1695.76 --> 1699.36
[ __ ] he's doing with sandy hook it is

1697.84 --> 1701.279
embarrassing

1699.36 --> 1704.0
at this point

1701.279 --> 1706.559
it's so embarrassing that i'm just like

1704.0 --> 1709.12
ready to let him die

1706.559 --> 1711.44
for that yeah alex you want to be that

1709.12 --> 1712.399
[ __ ] [ __ ] about it

1711.44 --> 1713.2
okay

1712.399 --> 1714.4799999999998
then

1713.2 --> 1718.0
[ __ ]

1714.48 --> 1718.0
roll over and die then

1718.399 --> 1722.9599999999998
and i'll make sure to have your corpse

1720.72 --> 1724.96
check to actually check that it is you

1722.96 --> 1728.679
that is dead for your own [ __ ]

1724.96 --> 1728.679
stupidity here

1741.44 --> 1746.48
and it's a shill confirmed

1744.48 --> 1750.0
chill for what

1746.48 --> 1750.0
like what does that even mean

1750.08 --> 1754.1589999999999
what's the definition of the word shill

1754.559 --> 1758.399
then

1755.919 --> 1760.5590000000002
let's cross reference that to what alex

1758.399 --> 1764.7199999999998
jones was saying

1760.559 --> 1764.72
what was he shilling for

1765.039 --> 1771.039
yeah shilling is

1767.679 --> 1774.799
chill to be a shill is based on business

1771.039 --> 1774.799
interaction you get paid

1774.88 --> 1781.3600000000001
to represent an interest or

1777.919 --> 1783.76
to help a sale in any form whether it is

1781.36 --> 1785.6789999999999
through trickery or through overt

1783.76 --> 1788.559
advertising

1785.679 --> 1789.6000000000001
you help sell something a narrative or a

1788.559 --> 1790.72
product

1789.6 --> 1794.9189999999999
so

1790.72 --> 1794.919
what was he shilling

1795.84 --> 1801.12
and where is the business receipt

1799.76 --> 1802.32
or

1801.12 --> 1804.8799999999999
or

1802.32 --> 1807.279
your [ __ ] retards i'm talking to you

1810.399 --> 1816.1589999999999
because they're [ __ ] complacent easy

1813.36 --> 1819.12
going go with the flow retards yeah i'm

1816.159 --> 1819.919
calling you out right now in my chat

1819.12 --> 1823.039
or

1819.919 --> 1826.0800000000002
he could be gaslighting the [ __ ] out of

1823.039 --> 1828.08
that entire court

1826.08 --> 1830.399
which is not a court

1828.08 --> 1833.6789999999999
the judge is a [ __ ] [ __ ] is not

holding to any legal standards even to

1833.679 --> 1839.919
international degree

1836.799 --> 1844.0
it's a mockery

1839.919 --> 1848.48
like it doesn't matter what is said

1844.0 --> 1851.039
in such a procedure it's a mockery

1848.48 --> 1855.039
i mean you could literally might as well

1851.039 --> 1858.08
just drag in a a physical literal puppet

1855.039 --> 1859.919
theater and they're just [ __ ] around

1858.08 --> 1862.8799999999999
doing whatever

1859.919 --> 1866.7990000000002
it's that has the same weight as saying

1862.88 --> 1869.44
anything else in such a giant mock-up

1866.799 --> 1872.44
procedure that has nothing to do with

1886.72 --> 1892.96
it's ridiculous gadget inspector

1890.0 --> 1896.559
i am going to ban you if you don't shut

your [ __ ] [ __ ] mouth i'm so sick of

1896.559 --> 1902.0
these french

1898.08 --> 1904.84
[ __ ] outbursts of yours

1902.0 --> 1908.399
i don't allow people that stupid in my

1904.84 --> 1911.6789999999999
chat you understand i don't allow people

1908.399 --> 1915.9189999999999
that are that dumb in my chat

1911.679 --> 1915.919
gadget inspector you're pissing me off

1918.399 --> 1923.76
none of anything

1920.64 --> 1925.6000000000001
there what you said makes sense

1923.76 --> 1929.84
how can you make

1925.6 --> 1934.1999999999998
money of that how does that even work

1929.84 --> 1934.1999999999998
how does that even work

1936.48 --> 1939.6
i mean i could say

1944.08 --> 1949.9189999999999
i'm making money

1947.279 --> 1952.32
on the fact that people

1949.919 --> 1955.3600000000001
or have physicality assumption bias

1952.32 --> 1957.36
about the celestial lights i i may all

1955.36 --> 1960.399
the money i make is because of the

1957.36 --> 1962.6399999999999
physicality assumption bias

1960.399 --> 1963.9189999999999
yes yes of course

1962.64 --> 1966.48
i mean

1963.919 --> 1968.96
if you just say it it makes sense right

1966.48 --> 1971.84
that's just logical then you can

1968.96 --> 1974.24
directly prove that

1971.84 --> 1976.6399999999999
the money i made is because of

1974.24 --> 1977.6
physicality assumption bias

1976.64 --> 1979.679
yes

1977.6 --> 1982.32
because you say it that makes a lot of

1979.679 --> 1982.3200000000002
sense now

1983.76 --> 1987.919
just repeating what yeah

1985.919 --> 1990.3990000000001
no but the the problem is is that you're

1987.919 --> 1992.64
just repeating it verbatim

1990.399 --> 1994.799
like it actually means anything

1992.64 --> 1997.6000000000001
you're not adding any personal

1994.799 --> 1999.84
observation points to

you just spent the last 10 sentences

2016.399 --> 2022.0
laying out all that detail about him

2019.039 --> 2024.32
because you never cared that much

2022.0 --> 2026.88
you cared enough

look i've seen alex jones say like

2057.679 --> 2064.639
genuinely aggravatingly stupid things

2062.48 --> 2067.119
that are just lies

2064.639 --> 2069.359
like you think he was gonna be sarcastic

2067.119 --> 2073.359
and then he just doubles down on

2069.359 --> 2076.159
something that like he should never say

2073.359 --> 2078.0789999999997
like oh i'm going crazy i'm i'm alex

2076.159 --> 2081.52

2078.079 --> 2084.8790000000004
going crazy oh oh can i please have your

2081.52 --> 2087.28
attention i want your attention i'm not

2084.879 --> 2090.3199999999997
an attention hog at all

2087.28 --> 2091.44
i'm not a little addicted media demon at

2090.32 --> 2092.7200000000003
all

2091.44 --> 2095.599
really

2092.72 --> 2098.0
so i'm gonna say something crazy now

2095.599 --> 2100.7200000000003
something crazy oh with legal

2098.0 --> 2104.64
implications oh

2100.72 --> 2106.8799999999997
i don't know what the [ __ ] he is doing

2104.64 --> 2109.2
it's so aggravating

2106.88 --> 2110.96
like what in relation to that stupid

2109.2 --> 2113.5989999999997
sandy hook right

2110.96 --> 2116.16
he he made like this sort of recorded

2113.599 --> 2118.96
statements in response to that and that

2116.16 --> 2121.68
was like 10 years ago

2118.96 --> 2124.2400000000002
and that [ __ ] thing made no sense i

2121.68 --> 2125.7599999999998
was like what the [ __ ] are you doing

2124.24 --> 2128.64
alex

2125.76 --> 2131.5200000000004
i literally wanted to kick him in the

2128.64 --> 2134.4
nuts for that that was so [ __ ] stupid

2131.52 --> 2136.32
he should have shut his [ __ ] mouth

2134.4 --> 2138.7200000000003
said nothing

2136.32 --> 2141.6800000000003
just nothing no he had to make a

2138.72 --> 2144.3999999999996
[ __ ] recording where he admitted

2141.68 --> 2147.5989999999997
things that he obviously hadn't done

2144.4 --> 2150.7200000000003
he didn't put any sarcasm in it

2147.599 --> 2153.599
he was just gaslighting himself like he

2150.72 --> 2156.0789999999997
was just on his knees like oh yes oh yes

2153.599 --> 2158.4
[ __ ] demons that are obviously lying

2156.079 --> 2160.1600000000003
please i surrendered you you can cut off

2158.4 --> 2163.52
my head now

2160.16 --> 2166.0
that sort of [ __ ] i have no idea what

2163.52 --> 2167.28
the hell he was doing

2166.0 --> 2172.44
and why

2167.28 --> 2172.44
makes no [ __ ] sense that he did that

2172.56 --> 2178.32
and that makes me feel

2174.32 --> 2178.32
that he's involved

2178.88 --> 2183.28
that he got caught up with this [ __ ] i

2181.119 --> 2185.6800000000003
think that sandy hook

2183.28 --> 2187.599
what that situation

2185.68 --> 2188.64
yeah

2187.599 --> 2191.28
you know

2188.64 --> 2193.7599999999998
the hook event

2191.28 --> 2195.28
on the on the sandy beaches

2193.76 --> 2196.48
i think

2195.28 --> 2199.0400000000004
it was

2196.48 --> 2201.44
not the thing they said it was at all

2199.04 --> 2203.52
but it was actually a really freaky

2201.44 --> 2206.48
double faced cover

2203.52 --> 2209.2
for something really dark

2206.48 --> 2212.16
an actual satanic sacrifice type

2209.2 --> 2215.1189999999997
situation that is quite quite rare in

2212.16 --> 2217.839
reality and think that it actually was

2215.119 --> 2220.6400000000003
there for that and i think alex may have

2217.839 --> 2223.119
stumbled upon it

2220.64 --> 2225.52
and then basically got like really

2223.119 --> 2227.6800000000003
heavily threatened as would typically

2225.52 --> 2229.839
happen when you do that

2227.68 --> 2232.0
and then he immediately fell on his

2229.839 --> 2234.64
knees so sucked somebody's dick or got

2232.0 --> 2237.44
raped in the ass and just like really

2234.64 --> 2238.8799999999997
[ __ ] surrendered like a like a [ __ ]

2237.44 --> 2242.7200000000003
slave

2238.88 --> 2245.52
alex surrendered like a [ __ ] slave

2242.72 --> 2247.9199999999996
to satanists

2245.52 --> 2252.16
that's what it feels like exactly like

2247.92 --> 2252.16
that exactly like that

2252.4 --> 2256.1600000000003
and

2253.359 --> 2258.3199999999997
i don't know he hasn't crawled back

2256.16 --> 2260.96
apparently he's really [ __ ] his

2258.32 --> 2263.04
pants over this entire ordeal

2260.96 --> 2265.359
because it makes absolutely no sense it

2263.04 --> 2268.8
makes no legal sense

2265.359 --> 2272.0789999999997
it's like he's playing along with the

2268.8 --> 2274.079
[ __ ] he's like enforcing their

2272.079 --> 2276.5600000000004
satanic

2274.079 --> 2278.6400000000003
virtual power like oh it's so scary i

2276.56 --> 2283.2799999999997
can't do anything against this it's like

2278.64 --> 2286.5989999999997
he's gaslighting the public for them

2283.28 --> 2286.599
it's ridiculous

2309.52 --> 2315.52
yeah [ __ ] off brenda go [ __ ] kill

2312.079 --> 2315.52
yourself you [ __ ] hag

2316.32 --> 2321.48
marxist sell out scumbag demon

2334.8 --> 2340.88

anybody has anything to say it's just

2343.52 --> 2348.32

2351.52 --> 2355.32
is that what you're gonna do

2364.8 --> 2369.8390000000004
right so that's what i think that's

2366.56 --> 2369.839

it just all continues

2426.319 --> 2433.04

2474.079 --> 2481.4
watched his show every day do you

2477.44 --> 2481.4

2482.72 --> 2487.7599999999998
yeah steamy traveler i saw that not

2485.28 --> 2490.76
really super interesting and yeah that's

2487.76 --> 2490.76
real

2516.56 --> 2521.04
i mean i can't really add anything to

2519.599 --> 2523.44
that article

2521.04 --> 2526.16
or that subject it's just yeah it's real

2523.44 --> 2527.92
it's just yeah they describe exactly how

2526.16 --> 2530.0
they do it that's how it works

2527.92 --> 2531.76
interesting isn't it yeah

2530.0 --> 2534.319
nature has all kinds of fascinating

2531.76 --> 2535.28
mechanics

2534.319 --> 2536.48
right

2535.28 --> 2540.079
so yeah

2536.48 --> 2543.92
spider robot it's kind of like

2540.079 --> 2546.5600000000004
a cyborg it's a spider cyborg it's a

2543.92 --> 2547.92
spider corpse that is electronically

2546.56 --> 2550.96
being triggered

2547.92 --> 2552.56
it has a duration then it runs out

2550.96 --> 2556.2400000000002
yeah

2552.56 --> 2556.24
welcome to the 21st century

2558.88 --> 2565.2400000000002
although i think they probably already

2560.319 --> 2565.24
did that in like the in the 20th century

2565.76 --> 2568.7200000000003
with other things

2572.76 --> 2576.48
[Music]

2574.48 --> 2579.839
anyway thanks for attempting to change

2576.48 --> 2579.839
the subject steven traveler

2591.44 --> 2593.839
right

2602.16 --> 2606.48
oh by the way

2604.0 --> 2609.92
kind of annoying

2606.48 --> 2611.76
i was on like the dutch site remember

2609.92 --> 2614.0
i think i brought it up yesterday as

2611.76 --> 2614.0
well

2615.04 --> 2621.359
about the silly globe spin

2617.52 --> 2623.359
oh no it's so dangerous

2621.359 --> 2625.5989999999997
i tried to comment there

2623.359 --> 2628.48
and they just deleted it

2625.599 --> 2631.3590000000004
i kept it really really simple and they

2628.48 --> 2633.92
just deleted it which is weird

2631.359 --> 2636.96
it was flat earth related but somebody

2633.92 --> 2639.76
else who's literally named their account

2636.96 --> 2639.76
flat earth

2641.44 --> 2647.119
they have a message there

2644.56 --> 2650.24
so that was weird

2647.119 --> 2652.1600000000003
see maybe it was extremely belated

2650.24 --> 2656.7599999999998
let me scroll

2652.16 --> 2656.7599999999998
see if it's there after all

2662.88 --> 2668.1600000000003
because all that i really did was say

2665.839 --> 2670.48
the earth is flat

2668.16 --> 2673.359
stationary and enclosed

2670.48 --> 2677.079
in in dutch

2673.359 --> 2677.0789999999997
that's all i did

2686.4 --> 2691.79
yep it's gone

2688.6 --> 2691.79
[Music]

2704.45 --> 2707.5699999999997
[Music]

2709.62 --> 2714.23
[Music]

2717.96 --> 2721.059
[Music]

2722.319 --> 2725.319
so

2726.16 --> 2742.9089999999997
[Music]

[Music]

2760.16 --> 2765.149
well i'm just

2762.09 --> 2765.1490000000003
[Music]

2779.92 --> 2785.6800000000003
yep yeah they they're anti-flat earth

2783.44 --> 2788.56
this website that i've been following

2785.68 --> 2792.0
for what is it 15 years

2788.56 --> 2795.599
they're anti-flat earth

2792.0 --> 2795.599
they know and they delete

2796.4 --> 2802.0
so yeah i'm gonna get on your ass over

2799.52 --> 2805.44
that and i'm gonna like really make you

2802.0 --> 2808.079
feel that nine for news dot nl

2805.44 --> 2809.76
guys where i know you actually operate

2808.079 --> 2812.48
and have met

2809.76 --> 2814.48
some of you in person

2812.48 --> 2817.04
a long time ago

2814.48 --> 2819.04
yeah you're gatekeeping

2817.04 --> 2821.04
you're gatekeeping and you literally

2819.04 --> 2823.2
have token flat earthers to have

2821.04 --> 2826.16
somebody say something about flat earth

2823.2 --> 2828.24
and you deleted all the other flat earth

2826.16 --> 2831.2
comments including mine

2828.24 --> 2835.4399999999996
without any kind of offensive lingo

2831.2 --> 2835.4399999999996
whatsoever completely neutral

2837.28 --> 2842.96
and i'm gonna write comments about that

2840.16 --> 2844.8799999999997
knight for news literally censors flat

2842.96 --> 2848.079
earth sensors

2844.88 --> 2848.079
full-on censorship

2848.16 --> 2854.48
yeah anti-flat earth commenters are

2851.52 --> 2856.0
still saying their [ __ ] though

2854.48 --> 2858.0
because there's a lot of anti-flat

2856.0 --> 2861.119
earthers in the netherlands a lot of

2858.0 --> 2862.48
like really nasty nerdy

2861.119 --> 2865.04
[ __ ]

2862.48 --> 2866.8
that are just gross

2865.04 --> 2869.68
and arrogant

2866.8 --> 2871.28
and stupid really [ __ ] stupid all

2869.68 --> 2875.0
they have is peer pressure they don't

2871.28 --> 2875.0
actually know anything

2881.17 --> 2887.809
[Music]

2899.52 --> 2902.559
right so that annoyed me

2901.599 --> 2904.559
right

2902.559 --> 2908.1600000000003
and when that happens i get more

2904.559 --> 2911.92
specific yeah because if i like

2908.16 --> 2914.3999999999996
what you do source whatever source that

2911.92 --> 2916.64
doesn't obviously relate to flat earth

2914.4 --> 2918.559
like they're not flat earthers

2916.64 --> 2921.2
and yeah if i let's see what i what you

2918.559 --> 2924.0
do and i like it then i'll even like

2921.2 --> 2925.359
keep your name out of it

2924.0 --> 2927.52
and all that

2925.359 --> 2928.7999999999997
right because i'm a flat earther for

2927.52 --> 2930.24
nine yeah then

2928.8 --> 2932.0
you might get attention you didn't

2930.24 --> 2936.16
really want

2932.0 --> 2938.319
yeah well if you're just obviously

2936.16 --> 2941.04
gonna censor

2938.319 --> 2942.4
philosophical comments

2941.04 --> 2946.48
right

2942.4 --> 2948.7200000000003
not political philosophical

2946.48 --> 2951.44
uh well yeah

2948.72 --> 2954.839
you're gonna get named then then i'm

2951.44 --> 2958.319
actually gonna name you and write you

2954.839 --> 2958.319
out because

2958.72 --> 2962.7999999999997
i find that unacceptable

2963.76 --> 2966.079
yeah

2966.72 --> 2974.0
especially from an officially registered

2970.079 --> 2976.7200000000003
officially registered flat earther

2974.0 --> 2979.52
that is openly doxxed

2976.72 --> 2981.359
and present all day long and extremely

2979.52 --> 2984.24
open about themselves and has a

2981.359 --> 2988.16
prominent place in

2984.24 --> 2988.16
flat earth cosmology

2990.8 --> 2996.6400000000003
yeah i'm not some random troll guy

3098.96 --> 3102.16
the place they're literally trying to

force a cashless society they're

3104.64 --> 3108.7999999999997

3110.72 --> 3116.16
with all the other crap dude

3114.48 --> 3118.079

3120.319 --> 3125.839
installed on a pyre

3123.04 --> 3125.839

3132.88 --> 3137.6800000000003
what's it gonna take

3134.96 --> 3139.92
like at some point some of these banking

3137.68 --> 3144.0
bastards are literally gonna get

3139.92 --> 3144.0
themselves killed over this [ __ ]

3145.04 --> 3150.96
i'm not saying i'm doing that personally

3148.72 --> 3150.9599999999996
but

3151.04 --> 3155.04
somebody is

3153.359 --> 3157.2799999999997

fill them up with diesel and plastic

3166.8 --> 3170.319
foam

3168.4 --> 3172.96
put a wick in it

3170.319 --> 3175.119
and then fire bomb the [ __ ] out of their

3172.96 --> 3177.359
house while they're sleeping in it

3175.119 --> 3178.88
and then they're gonna burn to death and

3177.359 --> 3182.64
if they have freaking children they're

3178.88 --> 3182.6400000000003

3182.96 --> 3187.68
you know bankers huh i'm not doing it

3185.839 --> 3189.839
i'm not saying that i'm doing that i'm

3187.68 --> 3191.839
saying it's gonna happen

3189.839 --> 3192.839
it's gonna happen if you keep pushing

3191.839 --> 3195.599
this

3192.839 --> 3197.839
anti-human demonic [ __ ]

3195.599 --> 3200.079
you understand oh you want all the power

3197.839 --> 3202.4
you have to do that according to your

3200.079 --> 3203.52
principles according to your

3202.4 --> 3205.04
god

3203.52 --> 3207.68
little g god

3205.04 --> 3210.0
gonna have to do that well yeah

3207.68 --> 3213.04
you do it you take power you're gonna

3210.0 --> 3214.96
make a sacrifice oh you you don't

3213.04 --> 3216.8
actually make a sacrifice in your life

3214.96 --> 3219.52
you're you're gonna make other people

3216.8 --> 3222.2400000000002
make that sacrifice well that means that

3219.52 --> 3224.079
at some point

3222.24 --> 3227.5989999999997
balance is gonna turn and then they're

3224.079 --> 3228.48
gonna make you the sacrifice for your

3227.599 --> 3230.88
god

3228.48 --> 3233.2
and then you're gonna burn

3230.88 --> 3236.559
and then after you burn

3233.2 --> 3240.24
you're gonna go to hell

3236.559 --> 3240.2400000000002
and then the burning will never stop

3240.8 --> 3244.8
so

3242.079 --> 3248.88
i suggest you uh

3244.8 --> 3252.8390000000004
consider your position very carefully

3248.88 --> 3252.839
in this coming period

3266.96 --> 3271.319
hey gorzilla good to see you

3280.14 --> 3283.3399999999997
[Music]

3284.24 --> 3290.68
which people get a lot of hate yeah

3286.799 --> 3290.68
and they deserve it

3293.04 --> 3296.72
because how did you get rich

3298.96 --> 3304.7200000000003
well certainly not by taking care of

3301.44 --> 3307.2000000000003
everybody around you

3304.72 --> 3310.0
and being honest and

3307.2 --> 3310.799
protective and

3310.0 --> 3313.599
like

3310.799 --> 3316.72
equality and make sure everybody gets

3313.599 --> 3319.04
through yeah that's not how you get rich

3316.72 --> 3319.04
you see

3319.44 --> 3326.079
yeah clever no clever people

3322.96 --> 3329.28
with no morality to hold them back

3326.079 --> 3330.559
tend to get rich over others people's

3329.28 --> 3334.28
back

3330.559 --> 3334.28
that's how it happens

3334.319 --> 3338.16
yeah and just because they can't see

3336.48 --> 3340.2400000000002
those other people

3338.16 --> 3342.0789999999997
because those other people

3340.24 --> 3343.9199999999996
they're getting rich over are not their

3342.079 --> 3344.96
direct friends that surround them but

3343.92 --> 3346.559
they're like

3344.96 --> 3349.28
i don't know some people in another

3346.559 --> 3352.6400000000003
country that are now going to have more

3349.28 --> 3355.2000000000003
government aggression towards them to

3352.64 --> 3357.04
work harder in the slave factories yeah

3355.2 --> 3358.96
well that's the people you're getting

3357.04 --> 3363.839
rich over their back yeah that's how

3358.96 --> 3365.92
people get rich over other people's back

3363.839 --> 3368.0789999999997
it's the only way

3365.92 --> 3370.319
that's that's how it works you

3368.079 --> 3372.0
understand you understand how this world

3370.319 --> 3374.799
works

3372.0 --> 3376.559
you can only get rich over other

3374.799 --> 3377.52
people's back

3376.559 --> 3380.6400000000003
it's

3377.52 --> 3384.64
the it's the thing you do

3380.64 --> 3385.839
it's how they the other rich people know

3384.64 --> 3388.72
oh

3385.839 --> 3392.5589999999997
there's another devil that's willing to

3388.72 --> 3395.04
literally crack some skulls to get rich

3392.559 --> 3396.4
that's how they know oh so you're one of

3395.04 --> 3399.2799999999997
us

3396.4 --> 3401.92
that's how it actually works

3399.28 --> 3403.92
doesn't matter what stories they weave

3401.92 --> 3406.16
on top of that and all that and how

3403.92 --> 3409.04
romantic it sounds and how well it fits

3406.16 --> 3411.68
and how smart it was and maybe they even

3409.04 --> 3414.319
helped some people here and there yeah

3411.68 --> 3416.5589999999997
this is how it works it always works

3414.319 --> 3419.68
like that that's how they know you're

3416.559 --> 3422.96
one of them

3419.68 --> 3425.839
you don't get rich

3422.96 --> 3425.839
in another way

3426.96 --> 3433.359
yeah no you're a liar

3430.4 --> 3436.4
you're a liar

3433.359 --> 3438.5589999999997
and that's fine you know hey rich people

3436.4 --> 3440.559
i wouldn't want to be rich but when you

3438.559 --> 3442.2400000000002
actually become rich

3440.559 --> 3444.88
and then you realize what a [ __ ]

3442.24 --> 3447.1189999999997
bastard you are to even be like that

3444.88 --> 3449.2000000000003
then yeah a lot of people will become

3447.119 --> 3451.839
delusional not accept what a sick

3449.2 --> 3453.4399999999996
bastard they are and then create an

3451.839 --> 3456.64
alternative

3453.44 --> 3459.119
universe story about themselves

3456.64 --> 3460.5589999999997
how they actually really try to be good

3459.119 --> 3464.319
people

3460.559 --> 3466.6400000000003
yeah that's what a lot of rich people do

3464.319 --> 3466.64
yeah

3467.28 --> 3472.3190000000004
you know what that is it's called

3468.92 --> 3474.559
compensation or overcompensation what do

3472.319 --> 3476.64
you have to overcompensate for that you

3474.559 --> 3479.119
actually got rich over other people's

3476.64 --> 3479.92
back by parasiting on them enslaving

3479.119 --> 3482.2400000000002
them

3479.92 --> 3485.2000000000003
using autographic governments

3482.24 --> 3488.0
to enslave other people to make you

3485.2 --> 3490.72
a buck yeah yeah yeah oh oh no you're

3488.0 --> 3493.68
going to be nice to another group of

3490.72 --> 3496.3999999999996
people to make it all right so you can

3493.68 --> 3500.64
balance out the utter

3496.4 --> 3502.88
exploitive evil with your charity oh yes

3500.64 --> 3505.92
of course god's gonna accept that oh

3502.88 --> 3508.559
you're good again oh yes

3505.92 --> 3509.44
yes that's how it works

3508.559 --> 3512.4
no

3509.44 --> 3514.799
no that's not how it works

3512.4 --> 3516.4
if you got rich you got rich over other

3514.799 --> 3518.04
people's back

3516.4 --> 3520.48
you can't

3518.04 --> 3523.68
compensate for that

3520.48 --> 3524.799
you could compensate for it legally

3523.68 --> 3527.04
yeah

3524.799 --> 3532.079
but that's legally

3527.04 --> 3533.359
that's earth's law that's not god's law

3532.079 --> 3536.079
yeah

3533.359 --> 3538.88
your charity to compensate for your

3536.079 --> 3541.599
atrocity atrocious deeds

3538.88 --> 3542.839
to get rich over other people's back is

3541.599 --> 3546.0
not going to be

3542.839 --> 3547.2799999999997
compensated by being nice to another

3546.0 --> 3549.76
group

3547.28 --> 3553.44
the only way you can actually

3549.76 --> 3555.28
atone for those deeds is by neutralizing

3553.44 --> 3558.4
them

3555.28 --> 3560.6400000000003
to stop the exploitation

3558.4 --> 3563.359
but you're not going to do that are you

3560.64 --> 3565.2
because you got rich like that

3563.359 --> 3568.24
you don't want to stop that you want to

3565.2 --> 3569.5989999999997
keep cracking the skulls enslaving like

3568.24 --> 3573.52
wrench

3569.599 --> 3576.079
squeezing some more because you get rich

3573.52 --> 3578.48
it's okay it's okay to squeeze them and

3576.079 --> 3582.0
enslave them because you got rich and

3578.48 --> 3584.799
now you can be nice to another unrelated

3582.0 --> 3586.559
group be so nice to them and then oh

3584.799 --> 3588.96
yeah everybody thinks you're a good guy

3586.559 --> 3590.4
because they're really [ __ ] [ __ ]

3588.96 --> 3593.28
and they don't understand how you

3590.4 --> 3595.6800000000003
actually got all that money in order to

3593.28 --> 3597.119
create this charade about how you're all

3595.68 --> 3598.48
charitable

3597.119 --> 3601.119
yeah

3598.48 --> 3602.16
yeah i know how you people work

3601.119 --> 3605.96
okay

3602.16 --> 3605.96
i know how it works

3615.2 --> 3620.319
i know people got rich from working yeah

3617.68 --> 3622.8799999999997
yeah i bet you do you're not one of them

3620.319 --> 3624.24
are you huh either you're not one of

3622.88 --> 3626.7200000000003
them

3624.24 --> 3629.04
i'm sure you know somebody

3626.72 --> 3630.72
that told you that that's how they got

3629.04 --> 3633.04
rich right

3630.72 --> 3636.319
did you confirm that

3633.04 --> 3636.319
no probably not

3637.04 --> 3641.359
yeah it's not you though you did not get

3639.68 --> 3645.04
rich like that

3641.359 --> 3645.04
because that doesn't really happen

3645.359 --> 3649.04
you only get rich over other people's

3648.079 --> 3651.44
back

3649.04 --> 3654.72
that's how you get the edge you take

3651.44 --> 3656.4
their edge and make it yours you enslave

3654.72 --> 3659.359
them you get the edge

3656.4 --> 3661.28
you ride the wave you get the big bucks

3659.359 --> 3662.4
that's how it works you get the big

3661.28 --> 3665.599
bucks

3662.4 --> 3668.4
because another group is locked out of

3665.599 --> 3672.559
that big box so that you get it that's

3668.4 --> 3672.559
how you get rich that's how it works

3676.72 --> 3683.0789999999997
i'm not seeking to become rich

3679.359 --> 3683.0789999999997
for the record here

3685.2 --> 3690.0
yeah george said i i wasn't even gonna

3687.28 --> 3692.7200000000003
go there it's just

3690.0 --> 3695.359
i i don't wanna let him straw man and

3692.72 --> 3697.52
gaslight the situation of the reality

3695.359 --> 3698.48
that i just laid down

3697.52 --> 3700.88
yeah

3698.48 --> 3702.48
because why do you think i've chosen

3700.88 --> 3705.28
poverty

3702.48 --> 3706.96
yeah i've chosen this i could have done

3705.28 --> 3708.96
something else i would have been [ __ ]

3706.96 --> 3711.28
miserable and pointless and shameful

3708.96 --> 3714.48
when i would have hated myself

3711.28 --> 3718.0
just for not doing this

3714.48 --> 3721.039
but i've learned a lot about money

3718.0 --> 3722.24
and rich people and how they lie how

3721.039 --> 3724.6400000000003
they lie

3722.24 --> 3725.68
to number one

3724.64 --> 3728.68
yeah

3725.68 --> 3728.68
themselves

3728.88 --> 3734.2400000000002
they lie to themselves

3732.24 --> 3735.68
they gas like themselves that's where

3734.24 --> 3738.319
they start

3735.68 --> 3741.7599999999998
it's called building an image

3738.319 --> 3743.359
building an image that's what they do i

3741.76 --> 3746.88
know this

3743.359 --> 3749.68
from second hand experience

3746.88 --> 3752.96
like or what did you third hand

3749.68 --> 3756.0389999999998
somebody else doing it that i knew

3752.96 --> 3758.7200000000003
jesuit guy explaining it to me

3756.039 --> 3760.1600000000003
explaining this system

3758.72 --> 3763.4399999999996
showing it

3760.16 --> 3765.359
with like other people that they

3763.44 --> 3769.2000000000003
ask them like

3765.359 --> 3771.7599999999998
how does this work and they would say it

3769.2 --> 3773.839
where i was standing like that sort of

3771.76 --> 3778.28
thing like i know

3773.839 --> 3778.2799999999997
how this works

3788.319 --> 3793.599
in terms of no it's not about the

3790.48 --> 3794.88
numerical value that makes you rich it's

3793.599 --> 3797.2000000000003
about

3794.88 --> 3799.2000000000003
the long-term

3797.2 --> 3801.5989999999997
things that are happening in order to

3799.2 --> 3804.799
sustain those riches

3801.599 --> 3807.28
having a numerical value

3804.799 --> 3808.88
on your bank account doesn't equate rich

3807.28 --> 3811.28
it just means you have a big pile of

3808.88 --> 3814.079
money

3811.28 --> 3817.039
piles of money deplete quickly they

3814.079 --> 3818.559
literally evaporate they literally

3817.039 --> 3820.559
evaporate

3818.559 --> 3822.7200000000003
unless you keep it in your mattress then

3820.559 --> 3825.2000000000003
just the value evaporates unless you

3822.72 --> 3827.1189999999997
keep goalie your mattress and then

3825.2 --> 3829.359
sort of does it

3827.119 --> 3833.28
you hope it doesn't get stolen

3829.359 --> 3837.5589999999997
right no it's what you do in order to

3833.28 --> 3837.559
keep that wealth

3838.319 --> 3845.24
yeah which means continuous exploitation

3841.92 --> 3846.799
means continuous investments

3845.24 --> 3849.2799999999997
corporations

3846.799 --> 3850.96
that make profit corporations that make

3849.28 --> 3853.52
profit

3850.96 --> 3856.48
often use

3853.52 --> 3860.079
well cheap labor cheap labor

3856.48 --> 3863.119
may entail slavery

3860.079 --> 3863.119
it's that basic

3863.2 --> 3868.48
and there is no

3865.52 --> 3870.799
hippocratic oath for the businessman

3868.48 --> 3873.599
there is it

3870.799 --> 3874.64
it's all just like oh oh you oh you you

3873.599 --> 3876.96
can

3874.64 --> 3879.0389999999998
you can allow yourself to do that okay

3876.96 --> 3880.7200000000003
thanks i'm gonna do it then i'm gonna

3879.039 --> 3882.48
get the i'm gonna take the grab i'm

3880.72 --> 3884.24
gonna be that shameless bastard then and

3882.48 --> 3886.0
take it from you

3884.24 --> 3888.0
and they all do it to one another they

3886.0 --> 3890.96
all make each other more greedy like

3888.0 --> 3893.92
that or they all make each other

3890.96 --> 3897.92
less moral about it they all push each

3893.92 --> 3900.48
other to become more demonic about it

3897.92 --> 3902.88
because that makes you weak

3900.48 --> 3905.52
and it's honest at the same time it's

3902.88 --> 3906.839
literally a pit of demons

3905.52 --> 3909.0389999999998
rich

3906.839 --> 3912.0
people are demons

3909.039 --> 3913.44
they cannot not be they they just become

3912.0 --> 3916.96
that

3913.44 --> 3919.52
because of the nature of being rich

3916.96 --> 3923.079
and sustaining richness

3919.52 --> 3923.079
sustaining riches

3924.64 --> 3930.16
right because if you're rich and you're

3927.44 --> 3933.839
good and let's say you got rich just

3930.16 --> 3935.44
from working so enthusiastically

3933.839 --> 3937.44
that you're just like working working

3935.44 --> 3940.559
and you didn't even think of making a

3937.44 --> 3942.96
fortune but then like after 10 years of

3940.559 --> 3946.4
just hard labor and you're like you love

3942.96 --> 3948.7200000000003
it and then it turns out to be like whoa

3946.4 --> 3950.559
damn this like it got a whole bunch of

3948.72 --> 3952.3999999999996
people that are interested and it's

3950.559 --> 3953.76
actually really valuable i cornered the

3952.4 --> 3956.0
market

3953.76 --> 3958.0
i didn't even realize and then you have

3956.0 --> 3960.16
wealth certainly

3958.0 --> 3962.559
well what's going to happen

3960.16 --> 3965.839
moment of realization

3962.559 --> 3967.2000000000003
inner polarization through morality what

3965.839 --> 3969.0389999999998
are you gonna do

3967.2 --> 3970.16
are you gonna keep your spirit or are

3969.039 --> 3973.2000000000003
you gonna

3970.16 --> 3974.5589999999997
embrace the riches and be

3973.2 --> 3976.72
pulled down

3974.559 --> 3979.039
towards the rich

3976.72 --> 3981.4399999999996
right it's in the moment of realization

3979.039 --> 3983.2000000000003
well a person that is moral

3981.44 --> 3984.799
well what they would typically do when

3983.2 --> 3986.64
they discover they certainly have

3984.799 --> 3989.28
unexpected riches is that they

3986.64 --> 3991.68
immediately invest it

3989.28 --> 3995.039
in things that they care about

3991.68 --> 3996.3999999999996
not to make profit but to sustain good

3995.039 --> 3997.8390000000004
things

3996.4 --> 4001.28
and that's

3997.839 --> 4002.48
how you distinguish a rich person

4001.28 --> 4004.48
from a

4002.48 --> 4006.64
person that just

4004.48 --> 4008.72
makes a lot of money because they're

4006.64 --> 4011.7599999999998
really good at what they do

4008.72 --> 4011.7599999999998
it's a big difference

4013.119 --> 4015.44
right

4019.2 --> 4024.799
not all rich demons are not all rich

4021.68 --> 4024.799
people are demons or really

4029.039 --> 4033.2000000000003
explain

4030.559 --> 4038.3590000000004
give me an example

4033.2 --> 4038.359
huh give me an example gadget inspector

4059.68 --> 4064.0
none of my friends are demons and

4061.359 --> 4066.4
they're all filthy rich yes keep telling

4064.0 --> 4068.48
yourself that

4066.4 --> 4072.0
yes

4068.48 --> 4076.359
they're all great people

4072.0 --> 4076.359
they're not twisted at all

4095.599 --> 4099.679
yeah right back exactly you get it

4100.4 --> 4105.5199999999995
a lot of people that are just like no no

4103.359 --> 4108.799
that doesn't happen no they're either

4105.52 --> 4110.96
just lying because like most rich people

4108.799 --> 4113.199
they're creating in parallel universe

4110.96 --> 4115.199
for themselves in which

4113.199 --> 4116.879999999999
they're good people and they do good

4115.199 --> 4119.44
things and that's what their narrative

4116.88 --> 4121.839
becomes about well they hide how they

4119.44 --> 4124.08
exploit

4121.839 --> 4127.2789999999995
and demoralize the [ __ ] out of the place

4124.08 --> 4129.759
to actually attain their riches

4127.279 --> 4132.719
cover story yeah and people fall for

4129.759 --> 4134.799
that because they don't want rich people

4132.719 --> 4137.92
to all be pieces of [ __ ]

4134.799 --> 4140.08
they don't want to believe that

4137.92 --> 4141.839
just like the rich people themselves

4140.08 --> 4144.839
don't want to believe it about

4141.839 --> 4144.839
themselves

4151.839 --> 4156.3189999999995
millions okay well having millions

4154.4 --> 4158.96
doesn't make you rich

4156.319 --> 4160.64
gadget inspector

4158.96 --> 4163.04
and as you say

4160.64 --> 4164.400000000001
is generous and he takes care of his

4163.04 --> 4166.64
family

4164.4 --> 4171.3589999999995
so that sounds like he's like a

4166.64 --> 4173.679
caretaker of family wealth type right

4171.359 --> 4175.92
now on the other hand gadget inspector

4173.679 --> 4178.4
your uncle seems like a cool person

4175.92 --> 4180.2390000000005
right what does he actually do for a

4178.4 --> 4182.0
living how did he actually get that

4180.239 --> 4184.239
money

4182.0 --> 4184.239
right

4185.199 --> 4189.839
have you ever thought about that

4195.46 --> 4198.609
[Music]

4202.4 --> 4205.44
oh construction

4205.52 --> 4211.1990000000005
right

4207.44 --> 4212.719
right so then he is an example of what i

4211.199 --> 4214.719
explained thank you by the way for

4212.719 --> 4216.719
telling me godzilla

4214.719 --> 4218.8
saved me a lot of scrolling

4216.719 --> 4221.679
but what i was telling earlier so he's a

4218.8 --> 4224.64
guy that just worked really really hard

4221.679 --> 4225.84
and was really passionate

4224.64 --> 4228.4800000000005
i take it

4225.84 --> 4231.679
he didn't actually like scan the place

4228.48 --> 4233.04
because there's scamming in construction

4231.679 --> 4236.88
as well

4233.04 --> 4239.36
right do you know your uncle that well

4236.88 --> 4241.679
does everybody really like him do do all

4239.36 --> 4245.44
his ex-business partners like him do all

4241.679 --> 4246.56
his customers actually like him

4245.44 --> 4248.4
right

4246.56 --> 4249.84
well you know him better than i do of

4248.4 --> 4252.799999999999
course but just

4249.84 --> 4255.28
asking you you should also take all of

4252.8 --> 4257.1990000000005
that into account

4255.28 --> 4258.8
looking hardware right okay well good

4257.199 --> 4262.159
for you man

4258.8 --> 4264.0
but look he has millions you say

4262.159 --> 4265.28
takes good care of his family and all

4264.0 --> 4266.88
that

4265.28 --> 4269.28
well that doesn't sound like a rich

4266.88 --> 4272.08
person yeah having millions is not a

4269.28 --> 4275.199
rich person i mean in these days if you

4272.08 --> 4277.04
want to do any real business you gotta

4275.199 --> 4279.5199999999995
have like a million

4277.04 --> 4279.5199999999995
at least

4282.8 --> 4287.28
i mean

4283.76 --> 4290.280000000001
the value of money has literally dropped

4287.28 --> 4290.28
significantly

4290.64 --> 4294.96
i mean a billionaire is the new

4292.96 --> 4298.56
millionaire now right millionaire

4294.96 --> 4298.56
doesn't really mean anything anymore

4299.04 --> 4301.84
so

4311.28 --> 4316.32
amount of control money they made in

4313.04 --> 4317.199
construction scare right

4316.32 --> 4320.48
yeah

4317.199 --> 4322.159
that's mafia that's criminal so

4320.48 --> 4323.199
millionaires the middle class now

4322.159 --> 4324.96
exactly

4323.199 --> 4325.839999999999
so it's not rich

4324.96 --> 4328.719
right

4325.84 --> 4330.96
rich actually being rich is about being

4328.719 --> 4334.08
on the edge is about

4330.96 --> 4336.32
riding that wave the wave of inflation

4334.08 --> 4336.32
right

4336.48 --> 4340.239
it's not about attaining wealth it's

4338.32 --> 4342.5599999999995
about keeping

4340.239 --> 4344.639999999999
that level of wealth that you attain

4342.56 --> 4346.64
that's the real rich

4344.64 --> 4349.4400000000005
those are the people that are gonna go

4346.64 --> 4351.84
the uh all the way

4349.44 --> 4353.839999999999
to keep it

4351.84 --> 4354.56
that's where the darkness really seeps

4353.84 --> 4357.84
in

4354.56 --> 4357.84
just having money

4358.88 --> 4362.0
doesn't make you rich

4369.679 --> 4376.0
okay well gadget specter good for you

4373.36 --> 4378.5599999999995
good for you

4376.0 --> 4381.92
my point still stands

4378.56 --> 4383.280000000001
and literally your example is one of my

4381.92 --> 4385.76
examples

4383.28 --> 4388.639999999999
you literally gave an example of my

4385.76 --> 4392.4400000000005
example of a typical exception

4388.64 --> 4392.4400000000005
so thank you for that

4423.52 --> 4428.159000000001
yeah they want steamy traveler they

4425.84 --> 4428.159000000001
won't

4429.6 --> 4435.04
i've already i'm not gonna go there

4432.4 --> 4436.159
i'm not gonna do that basic [ __ ] steamy

4435.04 --> 4437.84
traveler

4436.159 --> 4441.48
i mean look

4437.84 --> 4441.4800000000005
i'm not 12.

4441.679 --> 4446.0
okay why would you ask me such a thing

4447.679 --> 4451.84
i already had an inheritance from my

4450.239 --> 4453.12
mother

4451.84 --> 4456.400000000001
that's now

4453.12 --> 4456.4
almost 20 years ago

4456.56 --> 4462.88
like 16 years ago

4459.199 --> 4463.839999999999
it wasn't a million it was like 600 000

4462.88 --> 4466.4800000000005
what

4463.84 --> 4469.360000000001
more money that have i ever seen

4466.48 --> 4472.639999999999
and i did not waste it all immediately

4469.36 --> 4474.96
but i did not spend it as wisely as i

4472.64 --> 4479.4400000000005
wish i had in retrospect because i did

4474.96 --> 4482.4
not know how to maintain it

4479.44 --> 4484.48
i i basically just sat on it for a long

4482.4 --> 4487.199
time and

4484.48 --> 4489.12
was scared to lose it

4487.199 --> 4491.919999999999
that's really what happened

4489.12 --> 4494.719
i was not great with money

4491.92 --> 4498.159
but there's nobody i'm going to inherit

4494.719 --> 4500.64
any more of that from okay my dad is

4498.159 --> 4503.28
pretty much

4500.64 --> 4505.360000000001
broke like me he's not in super high

4503.28 --> 4506.719
debts or anything but he doesn't have

4505.36 --> 4508.639999999999
anything

4506.719 --> 4511.199
and i don't have any other family i

4508.64 --> 4513.360000000001
could inherit anything from

4511.199 --> 4515.599999999999
not that i would want to

4513.36 --> 4517.759999999999
i'd rather just have family

4515.6 --> 4519.1990000000005
family that i could actually live with

4517.76 --> 4522.84
and

4519.199 --> 4525.44
that would like me and hear me out and

4522.84 --> 4526.8
[ __ ] not be gay

4525.44 --> 4529.599999999999
all possible

4526.8 --> 4529.6
that would be great

4534.96 --> 4541.04
right i do have like one rich uncle but

4539.04 --> 4544.239
he's an uncle he has kids

4541.04 --> 4544.239
it's not gonna happen

4545.84 --> 4553.76
besides like that's his money

4548.159 --> 4557.799999999999
like i'm not just like it's not mine

4553.76 --> 4557.8
why would i deserve that

4575.04 --> 4578.96
no one gets anywhere without working

4576.8 --> 4581.84
hard yeah that is true

4578.96 --> 4581.84
even for the rich

4581.92 --> 4584.2390000000005
i mean it's not

4583.36 --> 4587.44
just

4584.239 --> 4589.04
autopilot to be rich

4587.44 --> 4592.32
you have to be busy

4589.04 --> 4592.32
it's just evil

4592.64 --> 4596.320000000001
that's the that's the big thing just

4594.48 --> 4599.12
because you worked hard doesn't make it

4596.32 --> 4599.12
less evil

4599.36 --> 4604.0
right but again just working a

4601.76 --> 4606.96
profession

4604.0 --> 4609.36
working hard making many hours

4606.96 --> 4610.96
not wasting your money on gambling and

4609.36 --> 4612.799999999999
nonsense like that

4610.96 --> 4614.32

4612.8 --> 4616.2390000000005
wealthy

4614.32 --> 4619.04

4616.239 --> 4622.239
not the stinking rich billionaires that

4619.04 --> 4623.92
literally use slave labor

4622.239 --> 4627.04
to write

4623.92 --> 4629.6
the curve and stay ahead of inflation

4627.04 --> 4629.6
and all that

4630.08 --> 4636.199
and use government socialism and

4632.239 --> 4636.199

4839.76 --> 4844.2390000000005

4842.159 --> 4847.04
maintain this

4844.239 --> 4849.678999999999
although i'll probably just get like

4847.04 --> 4851.679
companies at like money advisory

4849.679 --> 4853.12
companies just from the netherlands

4851.679 --> 4855.49

4857.679 --> 4860.56
i don't

4858.84 --> 4862.159000000001
know

4860.56 --> 4865.360000000001
but yeah

4862.159 --> 4866.4
if something like that happens

4865.36 --> 4869.44
yeah

4866.4 --> 4871.599999999999
i would love some advice only then

4869.44 --> 4874.48
on how to actually maintain that sort of

4871.6 --> 4876.639
money but until then i don't really need

4874.48 --> 4879.28
to know

4876.639 --> 4879.28
too much

4879.76 --> 4883.400000000001
about all that

4917.679 --> 4922.12
25 watching awesome

4942.639 --> 4947.36
yeah yeah you know

4944.639 --> 4949.12
it's completely true the more money you

4947.36 --> 4950.96
have the easier it is to make it the

4949.12 --> 4952.88
first meal is the hardest yeah you know

4950.96 --> 4955.52
what's actually being milled

4952.88 --> 4955.52
your soul

4956.239 --> 4960.879999999999
so yeah oh once you get going it's so

4958.719 --> 4962.0
easy

4960.88 --> 4964.400000000001
but

4962.0 --> 4970.04
you are literally

4964.4 --> 4970.04
like grinding up your soul doing it

4972.48 --> 4976.239
until you realize that you have no more

4974.239 --> 4979.44
soul to grind up and then you're just a

4976.239 --> 4979.44
robot making money

4980.8 --> 4985.360000000001
but now even the reason you originally

4983.199 --> 4987.44
wanted it

4985.36 --> 4990.0
is not yielding

4987.44 --> 4992.32
because you lost

4990.0 --> 4994.8
the longing and the lust

4992.32 --> 4996.5599999999995
to even go after those things so all you

4994.8 --> 4999.1990000000005
then do is just

4996.56 --> 5001.92
have the money maintain it

4999.199 --> 5005.599999999999
and you probably become very miserable

5001.92 --> 5005.6
because you don't have a soul anymore

5007.6 --> 5013.679
you just have the money now

5010.88 --> 5015.52
and no more soul to actually want to

5013.679 --> 5016.96
spend it right because that's what you

5015.52 --> 5019.1990000000005
wanted you wanted all the money so you

5016.96 --> 5021.52
could all do all those fun things

5019.199 --> 5022.799999999999
that your soul helped you to want to

5021.52 --> 5024.400000000001
long for

5022.8 --> 5025.92
no you don't have a soul anywhere you

5024.4 --> 5028.08
got a money and then what it doesn't

5025.92 --> 5031.679
mean anything anymore

5028.08 --> 5034.96
suddenly you're not gonna be that proud

5031.679 --> 5038.56
as you fantasized about it

5034.96 --> 5040.719
you're not gonna be the cool guy

5038.56 --> 5042.4800000000005
you're gonna actually be parasited on

5040.719 --> 5044.8
and people are just going to be like

5042.48 --> 5046.4
little dogs wanting their treats because

5044.8 --> 5051.639
they don't even see you anymore they

5046.4 --> 5051.638999999999
just see your money yeah welcome to hell

5065.84 --> 5068.84
hmm

5095.44 --> 5098.44
uh

5099.84 --> 5105.719
well i'm gonna get some cold water

5102.719 --> 5105.719

5165.92 --> 5171.52
what the hell have you been smoking then

5168.56 --> 5171.52
jack darron

5173.199 --> 5178.719
i mean i've smoked plenty i never got

5175.52 --> 5181.1990000000005
any cancer from that [ __ ]

5178.719 --> 5184.8
but then again i was always very careful

5181.199 --> 5186.08
not to just smoke toxic crap

5184.8 --> 5189.4400000000005
ever

5186.08 --> 5191.6
not even for oh so funny

5189.44 --> 5194.5599999999995
right like stupid [ __ ] i've seen other

5191.6 --> 5195.679
kids do like oh let's have some leaves

5194.56 --> 5197.84
of just

5195.679 --> 5199.6
plants

5197.84 --> 5201.6
and then we smoke them and then inhale

5199.6 --> 5204.88
it and cough for the fun of it that's

5201.6 --> 5207.04
stupid [ __ ] like i was like no

5204.88 --> 5209.12
let's not do that

5207.04 --> 5210.4
of course you can do that with like pine

5209.12 --> 5213.5199999999995
needles

5210.4 --> 5217.759999999999
don't breathe too deeply but it is

5213.52 --> 5217.76
aromatic and even has yeah

5218.639 --> 5222.96
the pine scent and all that

5221.6 --> 5226.56
but just

5222.96 --> 5228.639
be careful with what you're gonna smoke

5226.56 --> 5232.2390000000005
mainly cigarettes yeah well cigarettes

5228.639 --> 5234.88
are filled with additives garbage poison

5232.239 --> 5235.759999999999
that actually gives you the cancer

5234.88 --> 5238.400000000001
not

5235.76 --> 5240.719
the tobacco the tobacco doesn't actually

5238.4 --> 5243.28
do that it's the [ __ ] they put in the

5240.719 --> 5243.28
cigarettes

5243.84 --> 5248.360000000001
i did have a show about that yesterday

5258.96 --> 5264.639
night [ __ ] dude no i wouldn't smoke

5261.76 --> 5267.639
nightshade either that sounds a little

5264.639 --> 5267.639
dangerous

[Music]

5292.159 --> 5295.159
uh

5330.159 --> 5334.638999999999
not religious either yeah but it has

5332.239 --> 5338.4
nothing to do with religion though

5334.639 --> 5340.719
although yeah colloquial religious as in

5338.4 --> 5344.0
oh what people would say

5340.719 --> 5345.199
as religious like 20 years ago remember

5344.0 --> 5347.36
that

5345.199 --> 5349.599999999999
yeah it turns out that words don't

5347.36 --> 5352.639
actually mean what we thought they meant

5349.6 --> 5352.639
back then you see

5353.199 --> 5358.32
do you realize that

5356.08 --> 5360.4
religious is not

5358.32 --> 5362.4
like how it's even currently being

5360.4 --> 5366.879999999999
defined

5362.4 --> 5369.679
to relate to a diety that nonsense has

5366.88 --> 5372.400000000001
nothing to do with it

5369.679 --> 5377.159
yeah a religion doesn't have to have a

5372.4 --> 5377.159
deity that's absolute horse [ __ ]

5379.84 --> 5386.400000000001
can be specific exclusion of such the

5382.96 --> 5388.56
emptiness can be your deity

5386.4 --> 5388.5599999999995
so

5391.6 --> 5394.639
yeah

5392.48 --> 5396.799999999999
but uh yeah there

5394.639 --> 5399.36
you don't have to be religious

5396.8 --> 5402.0
to know that genetics

5399.36 --> 5404.639
and all life and all life forms in all

5402.0 --> 5406.239
its ways have been designed by a

5404.639 --> 5408.8
designer

5406.239 --> 5412.4
outside of physical existence before

5408.8 --> 5414.56
physical existence engaged

5412.4 --> 5416.799999999999
it was designed it has to be designed

5414.56 --> 5419.280000000001
it's the way it has manifested it cannot

5416.8 --> 5421.4400000000005
manifest in any other way

5419.28 --> 5425.12
there's no logical train of thought that

5421.44 --> 5427.199
could make it manifest the way it is now

5425.12 --> 5430.239
cannot be back engineered to be anything

5427.199 --> 5430.239
else but designed

5430.56 --> 5436.6
it's as simple as that

5433.39 --> 5436.6
[Music]

5436.719 --> 5440.88
how would i define religious religious

5439.36 --> 5443.599999999999
is

5440.88 --> 5443.6
religious

5443.679 --> 5450.0
is a dedication

5446.56 --> 5454.2390000000005
in a belief or narrative

5450.0 --> 5456.239
or set of stories or iconography oh yeah

5454.239 --> 5457.44
in a style

5456.239 --> 5459.759999999999
religious

5457.44 --> 5463.04
means you are basically

5459.76 --> 5465.52
stuck to a culture and a very critical

5463.04 --> 5468.719
aspect is that you don't necessarily

5465.52 --> 5471.360000000001
intellectually understand

5468.719 --> 5474.32
everything about that thing that you

5471.36 --> 5475.599999999999
believe in and will defend and take a

5474.32 --> 5476.48
position in

5475.6 --> 5478.0
right

5476.48 --> 5480.718999999999
that's a religion

5478.0 --> 5483.28
religion is believing something that you

5480.719 --> 5485.76
don't fully understand

5483.28 --> 5488.08
and then pursuing that belief

5485.76 --> 5491.2390000000005
that's a religion

5488.08 --> 5491.239
to me

5498.56 --> 5503.76
right so things like christian values

5501.92 --> 5506.4800000000005
has nothing to do with religion

5503.76 --> 5510.08
christian values are simply as a code of

5506.48 --> 5510.08
conduct set of principles

5510.159 --> 5516.239
now

5510.96 --> 5519.28
there is a religion put on top of that

5516.239 --> 5522.638999999999
with courtesy of the catholic church

5519.28 --> 5524.96
about how he is god and the son of god

5522.639 --> 5527.04
and it's all the same and it

5524.96 --> 5530.639
and that means that

5527.04 --> 5533.92
christian principles are of god and blah

5530.639 --> 5537.84
weird esoteric consequences

5533.92 --> 5537.84
kind of luciferian in my opinion

5538.08 --> 5542.48
now you're forgiven

5540.159 --> 5545.36
by for everything you did because you

5542.48 --> 5549.199
believe that jesus was actually god blah

5545.36 --> 5550.4
blah blah crazy [ __ ]

5549.199 --> 5552.0
that

5550.4 --> 5554.879999999999
that's the religion

5552.0 --> 5557.28
now christian values and christian

5554.88 --> 5560.639
methods

5557.28 --> 5562.4
so social interaction strategies

5560.639 --> 5566.08
that's not religious

5562.4 --> 5569.5199999999995
but there is a religion on top of that

5566.08 --> 5572.5199999999995
which is very widespread

5569.52 --> 5572.52
see

5574.32 --> 5579.04
who defined christian values the

5576.32 --> 5579.04
consensus

5580.719 --> 5584.56
the consensus based on interpretation of

5583.52 --> 5586.159000000001
christ

5584.56 --> 5589.360000000001
christ's words

5586.159 --> 5592.239
but it is consensus driven

5589.36 --> 5594.88
certain words may be ignored of what

5592.239 --> 5596.879999999999
christ said and then other words focused

5594.88 --> 5599.92
on it all depends on the culture

5596.88 --> 5601.679
and what is more important

5599.92 --> 5603.76
for them

5601.679 --> 5606.08
right

5603.76 --> 5608.88
so christian values are all derived from

5606.08 --> 5610.48
what jesus christ has actually said with

5608.88 --> 5612.96
his words

5610.48 --> 5615.959999999999
and the fractal implications of those

5612.96 --> 5615.96
words

5616.719 --> 5620.8
and then the actual values are the ones

5619.199 --> 5623.599999999999
that the people

5620.8 --> 5626.719
of a culture of a group of a society

5623.6 --> 5629.04
agree upon in reflection of jesus's

5626.719 --> 5632.639
words

5629.04 --> 5632.639
so it is consensus driven

5632.8 --> 5635.8
right

5652.96 --> 5658.04
yeah already addressed that t now

5655.04 --> 5658.04
bosalin

5666.0 --> 5669.6
jesus is god is satan level massive

5668.08 --> 5672.88
deception yeah

5669.6 --> 5675.360000000001
of course now it is a giant blasphemy

5672.88 --> 5678.08
everything that catholic church has done

5675.36 --> 5680.08
is a giant blasphemy is literally what

5678.08 --> 5682.32
they did

5680.08 --> 5684.32
the entire catholic religion which is

5682.32 --> 5686.719
the foundation of the modern

5684.32 --> 5690.159
understanding of christianity

5686.719 --> 5692.2390000000005
have literally tried to defile every

5690.159 --> 5694.679
principle that christ has ever put

5692.239 --> 5698.638999999999
forward

5694.679 --> 5702.08
encapsulate twist dislocate

5698.639 --> 5703.84
and people will approach the the jesus

5702.08 --> 5705.44
christ from the bible

5703.84 --> 5707.679
and then they get caught up in the

5705.44 --> 5709.119
priest the priests that surround him

5707.679 --> 5710.56
that tell you oh this is how you should

5709.119 --> 5712.5599999999995
this is what you should think about that

5710.56 --> 5714.719
is what it means

5712.56 --> 5716.4800000000005
and then yeah

5714.719 --> 5718.719
people don't actually

5716.48 --> 5720.879999999999
they're just like oh wow it's so amazing

5718.719 --> 5722.4800000000005
what they told me and then they read

5720.88 --> 5724.56
christ's words and like oh yeah that

5722.48 --> 5726.4
could definitely mean that but they've

5724.56 --> 5728.400000000001
already

5726.4 --> 5730.719
they don't have an open mind they're not

5728.4 --> 5733.199
feeling the fractal

5730.719 --> 5735.119
value and depth of jesus's words that

5733.199 --> 5737.119
way because they have preconception

5735.119 --> 5740.239
because of the priesthood

5737.119 --> 5743.199
it is telling them how to interpret his

5740.239 --> 5745.44
words

5743.199 --> 5747.28
that was always the trick they

5745.44 --> 5749.44
encapsulated

5747.28 --> 5750.4
jesus christ

5749.44 --> 5753.678999999999
to

5750.4 --> 5757.199
dislocate everything that he said

5753.679 --> 5758.639
to reinterpret and now instead of just a

5757.199 --> 5762.0
prophet

5758.639 --> 5765.4400000000005
and a communicator of god's wisdom now

5762.0 --> 5767.92
suddenly he is the son of god and he's

5765.44 --> 5768.839999999999
literally god incarnated and which is a

5767.92 --> 5771.84
giant

5768.84 --> 5774.08
blasphemy it is a blasphemy it is

5771.84 --> 5777.1990000000005
literally a blasphemy

5774.08 --> 5777.199
and yet they insist

5779.199 --> 5784.239
i mean jesus would not have agreed to

5782.159 --> 5786.32
anything

5784.239 --> 5787.759999999999
that happened

5786.32 --> 5790.639
after he died

5787.76 --> 5793.04
it's all a giant abomination

5790.639 --> 5795.84
and i think he kind of predicted that

5793.04 --> 5799.84
too that that would happen and it did

5795.84 --> 5799.84
and we're right here right now

5801.6 --> 5807.4400000000005
in the aftermath of what he did

5805.52 --> 5810.4800000000005
and what happened and what the catholic

5807.44 --> 5813.919999999999
church did the christianity we know

5810.48 --> 5815.919999999999
is not christianity it is actually

5813.92 --> 5819.36
a devil

5815.92 --> 5823.1990000000005
religion system that tried to mimic

5819.36 --> 5826.5599999999995
christianity and turn it into like a

5823.199 --> 5828.638999999999
just a little circus trick emulating

5826.56 --> 5832.400000000001
christianity that's what modern

5828.639 --> 5832.400000000001
christianity has really become

5832.88 --> 5840.96
it's satanic it is a mockery of the real

5836.56 --> 5844.320000000001
heritage of jesus christ a mockery of it

5840.96 --> 5846.32
all just playing games and little

5844.32 --> 5848.639
playing checkers when you should be

5846.32 --> 5851.679
playing chess yeah jesus christ was

5848.639 --> 5853.679
definitely metaphorically a chess player

5851.679 --> 5855.679
not a checker player now look what

5853.679 --> 5857.6
modern christians are doing they're

5855.679 --> 5859.76
playing checkers

5857.6 --> 5862.400000000001
just like the freemasons

5859.76 --> 5864.159000000001
huh huh yeah they're not playing chess

5862.4 --> 5866.08
they're playing checkers is everyone oh

5864.159 --> 5868.239
just that move and then you do this and

5866.08 --> 5871.76
then you did that and you never get the

5868.239 --> 5874.159
big picture you never really transform

5871.76 --> 5876.400000000001
everything around you you just play that

5874.159 --> 5878.48
game and you just play keep playing

5876.4 --> 5881.119
checkers

5878.48 --> 5883.119
that's what christianity has become

5881.119 --> 5886.0
playing checkers it's not

5883.119 --> 5889.5599999999995
playing chess like what jesus christ was

5886.0 --> 5889.56
actually doing

5905.28 --> 5909.04
yeah there is money in religion

5907.28 --> 5912.0
that's right

5909.04 --> 5913.119
which is an abomination

5912.0 --> 5917.6
yeah

5913.119 --> 5919.839999999999
making money in religion in the temple

5917.6 --> 5921.719
there's a certain scene where jesus

5919.84 --> 5926.0
christ himself

5921.719 --> 5928.0
explicitly forbade that and violently

5926.0 --> 5930.88
threw them out

5928.0 --> 5936.0
yeah that's how much jesus christ

5930.88 --> 5938.639
approves of churches making money

5936.0 --> 5941.28
of believers yeah that's how much jesus

5938.639 --> 5944.0
christ actually agrees with that

5941.28 --> 5946.32
enough to have an entire scene play out

5944.0 --> 5947.84
where he flips the tables and

5946.32 --> 5950.32
what is it like

5947.84 --> 5953.119000000001
uses a whip or something or a stick

5950.32 --> 5957.199
to kick the money changes out that's how

5953.119 --> 5959.599999999999
much jesus christ is okay

5957.199 --> 5961.28
with churches

5959.6 --> 5964.400000000001
using his word

5961.28 --> 5966.32
to collect a lot of wealth from people

5964.4 --> 5967.5199999999995
that are very generous and don't know

5966.32 --> 5968.719
what the hell they're doing with their

5967.52 --> 5971.280000000001
money

5968.719 --> 5973.52
yeah you think that jesus christ really

5971.28 --> 5974.32
would condone that

5973.52 --> 5976.719
no

5974.32 --> 5981.84
it is a giant devil scheme he kicked

5976.719 --> 5981.84
those people out when he was still there

5984.48 --> 5988.48
if jesus christ existed today

5986.96 --> 5991.84
no

5988.48 --> 5994.959999999999
just no he isn't it has no point for him

5991.84 --> 5996.400000000001
to exist

5994.96 --> 5998.4
like that

5996.4 --> 6002.239
and he would never be able to fulfill

5998.4 --> 6005.599999999999
the same role as he did back then

6002.239 --> 6008.159
if jesus christ communicated

6005.6 --> 6010.8
look if jesus christ would be the way

6008.159 --> 6012.96
that we tend to typically envision the

6010.8 --> 6015.679
way he would be

6012.96 --> 6017.36
which is very

6015.679 --> 6020.2390000000005
not very solid

6017.36 --> 6022.799999999999
not very reliable

6020.239 --> 6025.119
then if jesus was here we wouldn't even

6022.8 --> 6028.400000000001
know it he would just blend in he could

6025.119 --> 6030.5599999999995
just be a guy that you that's just extra

6028.4 --> 6032.799999999999
awesome that's it you wouldn't even know

6030.56 --> 6034.8
it was him

6032.8 --> 6037.28
because what the hell would be the point

6034.8 --> 6040.08
of coming out for who you are

6037.28 --> 6043.28
in this world unless you're like and

6040.08 --> 6046.239
direct uh you're an actual avatar of god

6043.28 --> 6049.199
right you're you're an actual little g

6046.239 --> 6051.678999999999
avatar like a flaming christ that would

6049.199 --> 6054.96
be like i am here

6051.679 --> 6056.56
to to seal the deal kind of thing that

6054.96 --> 6058.639
what a lot of christians like dream

6056.56 --> 6062.0
about like oh when was christ going to

6058.639 --> 6064.4800000000005
return well maybe there will be a christ

6062.0 --> 6066.239
return that's actually going to be not

6064.48 --> 6068.638999999999
just the modest

6066.239 --> 6070.638999999999
jesus christ we learned from the bible

6068.639 --> 6073.119
but actually more like a

6070.639 --> 6075.1990000000005
diety avatar

6073.119 --> 6077.28
that might return

6075.199 --> 6079.119
right well if they

6077.28 --> 6080.0
would return like that

6079.119 --> 6082.239
then

6080.0 --> 6084.32
yeah he would just do what the bible

6082.239 --> 6086.32
would say would happen he would just

6084.32 --> 6088.799999999999
announce i'm back

6086.32 --> 6090.4
i'm here to put things in order and just

6088.8 --> 6094.719
go

6090.4 --> 6097.44
right but if he was like a human sort of

6094.719 --> 6099.92
like like the type of

6097.44 --> 6102.08
undercover human that's uh

6099.92 --> 6104.2390000000005
if he was to like the jesus he's

6102.08 --> 6106.4
described as in the bible that would

6104.239 --> 6108.32
return in the now

6106.4 --> 6111.92
there's no point

6108.32 --> 6111.92
there's just no point to do that

6116.48 --> 6120.48
i mean what's going to happen people

6118.0 --> 6122.8
will just think he's the devil

6120.48 --> 6124.638999999999
he's either the devil or

6122.8 --> 6127.4400000000005
the creepy wizard

6124.639 --> 6128.56
or he is jesus christ and then it's just

6127.44 --> 6131.599999999999
gonna

6128.56 --> 6133.6
unleash giant amounts of chaos satanists

6131.6 --> 6136.0
are all gonna get obsessed with them

6133.6 --> 6137.76
christians are gonna turn against him

6136.0 --> 6140.96
because yeah they've been riding on the

6137.76 --> 6142.8
catholic fake christianity

6140.96 --> 6145.199
they've done everything wrong and oh

6142.8 --> 6148.400000000001
christ is right there oh yes

6145.199 --> 6151.5199999999995
that's the guy you allegedly based your

6148.4 --> 6153.839999999999
religion on and parasited on people for

6151.52 --> 6155.360000000001
yeah and now he's right there how are

6153.84 --> 6156.4800000000005
you going to justify everything you've

6155.36 --> 6157.679
done

6156.48 --> 6159.36
yeah they're not going to like it

6157.679 --> 6162.0
they're going to deny him they're going

6159.36 --> 6163.44
to say that's not the real jesus christ

6162.0 --> 6167.76
because

6163.44 --> 6167.759999999999
he won't allow us to squirt

6168.32 --> 6171.32
right

6176.4 --> 6182.4
so

6178.4 --> 6182.4
yeah there you go with the hypothetical

6187.04 --> 6191.28
so yeah

6189.199 --> 6193.759999999999
weird question steamy traveler but i

6191.28 --> 6193.759999999999
answered it

6199.04 --> 6202.08
yeah kumu

6203.28 --> 6209.679
wasn't the generic information that's

6206.4 --> 6212.96
being rolled out for the last 10 years

6209.679 --> 6214.88
wasn't that that yeah that was that it

6212.96 --> 6218.4
was always that that's like been echoed

6214.88 --> 6220.8
for a million times in the last 10 years

6218.4 --> 6220.799999999999
yeah

6222.48 --> 6228.839999999999
i mean it's hard to find anybody that

6224.4 --> 6228.839999999999
doesn't know that akuma virus

6238.96 --> 6242.4800000000005
right but

6240.08 --> 6245.36
not the sun by the way lucifer is not

6242.48 --> 6248.48
the sun it's the morning star which is

6245.36 --> 6250.88
venus the morning star is venus venus is

6248.48 --> 6253.04
the morning star

6250.88 --> 6256.0
in the early early mornings before the

6253.04 --> 6259.119
sun comes up you often see the morning

6256.0 --> 6261.04
star it seems unusually bright it's only

6259.119 --> 6263.92
a planet

6261.04 --> 6265.5199999999995
but it is like really bright in the

6263.92 --> 6268.639
morning

6265.52 --> 6271.6
like it becomes a mini sun before the

6268.639 --> 6272.84
actual sun comes up

6271.6 --> 6275.6
that's

6272.84 --> 6277.6
venus also

6275.6 --> 6282.4800000000005
declared lucifer

6277.6 --> 6282.4800000000005
although that is a roman designation

6286.639 --> 6290.4800000000005
like it yeah or sort of it's

6291.84 --> 6296.56
even does the word lucifer come from

6294.96 --> 6298.8
not sure

6296.56 --> 6301.4400000000005
venus is also roman

6298.8 --> 6303.119000000001
but all the planets are named after

6301.44 --> 6305.759999999999
roman god so

6303.119 --> 6309.04
which is extremely telling

6305.76 --> 6311.92
right roman roman catholic

6309.04 --> 6315.44
who came up with that

6311.92 --> 6317.6
why did suddenly get the roman gods get

6315.44 --> 6320.799999999999
diaphide in

6317.6 --> 6321.92
alleged bodies based on celestial

6320.8 --> 6323.76
lights

6321.92 --> 6325.28
into a virtual

6323.76 --> 6328.8
galaxy

6325.28 --> 6332.48
yeah it's all rome it's all rome it was

6328.8 --> 6333.84
always rome rome created heliocentric

6332.48 --> 6337.04
universe

6333.84 --> 6339.4400000000005
rome created fake christianity i've been

6337.04 --> 6340.4
trying to tell everybody about this for

6339.44 --> 6342.638999999999
like

6340.4 --> 6346.08
two three years now

6342.639 --> 6347.4400000000005
because i'm really getting this clear

6346.08 --> 6349.199
that's what it is this is where the

6347.44 --> 6350.799999999999
lingo comes from where the names come

6349.199 --> 6354.879999999999
from yeah

6350.8 --> 6357.679
i mean rome is a giant giant parasite

6354.88 --> 6360.32
everything they've done is parasite and

6357.679 --> 6362.4
assimilate from other cultures

6360.32 --> 6366.96
they parasited and assimilated their

6362.4 --> 6366.96
freaking diety system from the greeks

6367.04 --> 6372.32
then they parasited and assimilated

6370.159 --> 6373.759999999999
jesus

6372.32 --> 6376.0
from

6373.76 --> 6378.159000000001
i don't know from the jews but is it i

6376.0 --> 6380.159
don't even know if it was actually the

6378.159 --> 6382.5599999999995
jews that were really involved it's

6380.159 --> 6384.4
confusing but however they hijacked

6382.56 --> 6387.04
christ blatantly

6384.4 --> 6389.5199999999995
and then rewrote his story to become the

6387.04 --> 6391.119
opposite of what it is

6389.52 --> 6393.040000000001
pretty much

6391.119 --> 6395.199
declare him a deity

6393.04 --> 6399.44
or a god

6395.199 --> 6402.08
which is blasphemy etc etc priesthoods

6399.44 --> 6404.159
despite the specific warning of christ

6402.08 --> 6405.6
not to do that not to actually form a

6404.159 --> 6408.159
church like that not to give an

6405.6 --> 6410.88
authority away to another man

6408.159 --> 6414.48
they've done all of that

6410.88 --> 6417.119
they stole the god from the greek

6414.48 --> 6418.0
they stole jesus christ

6417.119 --> 6420.159
from

6418.0 --> 6421.36
jesus christ

6420.159 --> 6423.679
and then

6421.36 --> 6426.639
they put it all together

6423.679 --> 6428.4800000000005
and created a fictional universe to

6426.639 --> 6431.6
steal reality

6428.48 --> 6434.08
from man's mind

6431.6 --> 6438.159000000001
they stole everything

6434.08 --> 6438.159
rome stole everything

6438.32 --> 6444.799999999999
they stole the gods they stole christ

6440.8 --> 6446.719
they stole reality

6444.8 --> 6448.56
from the people

6446.719 --> 6452.639
you understand

6448.56 --> 6456.96
rome is satan

6452.639 --> 6462.32
everything they've done is satan

6456.96 --> 6462.32
replace reality destroy reality

6462.719 --> 6466.719
emulate

6464.159 --> 6469.599999999999
replace destroy

6466.719 --> 6473.76
everything they've done is satan is like

6469.6 --> 6475.280000000001
the rawest form of satan manifestation

6473.76 --> 6476.719
you could imagine

6475.28 --> 6479.199
everything they've done

6476.719 --> 6479.199
everything

6479.679 --> 6485.84
and they were not shy to human sacrifice

6483.119 --> 6485.839999999999
by the way

6495.199 --> 6501.44
that's right held to the chef i know

6499.52 --> 6503.360000000001
i really believe in the greek pantheon

6501.44 --> 6505.5199999999995
there is something really amazing about

6503.36 --> 6505.5199999999995
it

6506.4 --> 6513.839999999999
the roman pantheon is crap

6510.0 --> 6513.84
it's a cheap knockoff

6522.56 --> 6527.8
anyway i'm gonna run out the show it's

6524.48 --> 6527.799999999999
been interesting

6532.96 --> 6536.08
where did the roman aqueducts originally

6535.04 --> 6537.679
come from

6536.08 --> 6540.88
i don't know

6537.679 --> 6544.159
i mean i think that the romans did build

6540.88 --> 6547.119
they were very industrious oh by the way

6544.159 --> 6548.0
using a lot of slave labor

6547.119 --> 6551.119
yeah

6548.0 --> 6554.08
they conquered other peoples

6551.119 --> 6556.239
and then assimilated them as slaves to

6554.08 --> 6558.96
build for them that's how it worked

6556.239 --> 6561.119
right so yeah they did build a lot

6558.96 --> 6563.04
they literally stole everything

6561.119 --> 6565.28
everything they've done everything they

6563.04 --> 6568.48
created their entire culture is all

6565.28 --> 6570.48
stolen everything they've done is stolen

6568.48 --> 6572.08
everything they've done is stolen

6570.48 --> 6574.718999999999
everything

6572.08 --> 6577.28
they've done is stolen

6574.719 --> 6577.28
everything
