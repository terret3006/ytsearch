so this is like a whole cloud bank and

109.52 --> 115.84
it's moving pretty fast

112.72 --> 115.84
because of the wind

116.24 --> 130.16
right it's not very wet

128.0 --> 133.28
okay somebody just thought it's a good

130.16 --> 137.04
idea to light fireworks

133.28 --> 140.56
weird anyway

137.04 --> 143.84

203.68 --> 209.20000000000002

205.92 --> 211.44
i'll get to that anyway yeah there was a

209.2 --> 213.67999999999998
bow busters replay on the flat earth

211.44 --> 216.56
debates that was pretty cool

213.68 --> 216.56
and hilarious

218.159 --> 227.76
yeah it was nathan about simon and

221.44 --> 230.879
and again it's just fun to hear that

227.76 --> 232.39999999999998
oh wait no that was that was after now

230.879 --> 235.599
that's gonna be

232.4 --> 238.87900000000002
i'm correct this afternoon

235.599 --> 242.48
or this evening it was the thursday show

238.879 --> 242.48
was it yeah it was about no

243.76 --> 249.76
yeah sorry i'm mixing it up

247.04 --> 250.79899999999998
so bobas is replay but that was about

249.76 --> 253.92
fallacies

250.799 --> 254.87900000000002
it was really good to listen back to it

253.92 --> 257.359
and

254.879 --> 259.12
there was the thursday show i think and

257.359 --> 261.12
that was also pretty good and that was

259.12 --> 263.759
nathan about simon then so mixing up the

261.12 --> 263.759
two streams

264.0 --> 269.919
but uh yeah also owen benjamin

267.199 --> 271.84000000000003
was life and that was really awesome to

269.919 --> 275.12
be there

271.84 --> 278.32
sorry to say didn't make any notes

275.12 --> 278.32
but i really enjoyed it

278.88 --> 282.15999999999997
you know sometimes i i remember to make

281.28 --> 284.23999999999995
notes sometimes

282.16 --> 287.44
i'm just enjoying it and i'm just

284.24 --> 291.52
laughing a lot and i was laughing a lot

287.44 --> 291.52
as that is as far as i remember it

294.84 --> 301.44
also yeah i found out that

297.52 --> 301.44
south park made some new episode

302.4 --> 306.88
i don't know if you guys know about that

304.96 --> 310.63899999999995
but yeah they hadn't they haven't

306.88 --> 313.28
made any new episode for a while

310.639 --> 314.72
no new seasons but the pair yeah i check

313.28 --> 315.84
it every now and then and apparently

314.72 --> 319.44000000000005
they made this new

315.84 --> 321.19899999999996
extra long what they call the pandemic

319.44 --> 323.84
special

321.199 --> 325.6
and at first i thought oh no is this

323.84 --> 329.919
gonna suck

325.6 --> 335.199
but no no this was like mega south park

329.919 --> 335.19899999999996
comeback level like holy [ __ ]

337.039 --> 340.479
yeah if you haven't watched that one

339.12 --> 342.96
it's like an added on

340.479 --> 344.88
episode or something and it's just

342.96 --> 346.71999999999997
mind-blowing

344.88 --> 348.639
should so i definitely recommend you

346.72 --> 354.24
watch that it is

348.639 --> 356.319
very up-to-date with the typical covert

354.24 --> 357.36
information placement that south park

356.319 --> 360.56
does so

357.36 --> 361.759
so well it's full of it and it really

360.56 --> 364.88
makes you think

361.759 --> 367.28000000000003
and laugh a lot and think again like oh

364.88 --> 369.759
this is so typical south park

367.28 --> 370.4
but good stuff man so yeah latest south

369.759 --> 373.199
park

370.4 --> 375.12
pandemic special i i recommend like

373.199 --> 376.639
everyone checks that out it's really

375.12 --> 378.479
amazing i don't know how

376.639 --> 379.759
how you can find it i find it through

378.479 --> 381.59999999999997
some online

379.759 --> 385.039
website thing that's specifically for

381.6 --> 389.91900000000004
the netherlands i think but i'm not sure

385.039 --> 391.84
but i watched it over there i don't know

389.919 --> 393.84
you'll probably be able to download it

391.84 --> 396.31899999999996
somewhere because it's really good and

393.84 --> 398.79999999999995
really good movies like that tend to get

396.319 --> 403.28000000000003
a very wide spread

398.8 --> 403.28000000000003
in the uh in the online scene

403.6 --> 411.12
and the downloader scene so hey

406.96 --> 411.12
goddess which bella good to see you

413.36 --> 418.08000000000004
right and yeah also

416.4 --> 419.599
watched another movie didn't really

418.08 --> 422.71999999999997
finish it because

419.599 --> 424.319
it was really dark but interesting

422.72 --> 428.47900000000004
though

424.319 --> 431.36
because one of my favorite

428.479 --> 431.35999999999996
actors in there

433.759 --> 439.12
uh it was a movie and it it was kind of

436.88 --> 442.4
weird from the get-go because

439.12 --> 444.96
the title that netflix i watched there

442.4 --> 446.479
gave it was different as to the title

444.96 --> 449.68
that the movie itself gave

446.479 --> 452.639
itself because it was called drive

449.68 --> 453.919
angry but yeah netflix called it hell

452.639 --> 457.44
driver

453.919 --> 461.039
i don't know and yeah both titles

457.44 --> 464.08
were perfectly adequate for what that

461.039 --> 467.759
movie is so far it's pretty brutal

464.08 --> 471.52
gory and like

467.759 --> 472.08000000000004
yeah really metal almost but it's not

471.52 --> 476.79999999999995
like

472.08 --> 476.8
gothic but it's just really gritty

477.44 --> 482.4
and i don't know

480.96 --> 484.0
i thought it was actually kind of

482.4 --> 485.44
halfway interesting but there's just

484.0 --> 490.16
really dark [ __ ] in there

485.44 --> 492.56
and but what movie are we discussing

490.16 --> 495.199
now i'm not gonna elaborately discuss it

492.56 --> 496.8
because i didn't finish even watching it

495.199 --> 499.36
at some point it was just like now i'm

496.8 --> 501.28000000000003
not gonna watch this really i'm

499.36 --> 502.8
not gonna continue this deep into the

501.28 --> 505.11999999999995
night and then go to sleep

502.8 --> 506.16
that that's gonna suck so i just

505.12 --> 508.0
discontinued it

506.16 --> 510.639
i probably finished watching it

508.0 --> 513.919
somewhere in the evening today

510.639 --> 514.32
if i feel like it but called drive angry

513.919 --> 521.8389999999999
or

514.32 --> 521.839
hell driver i don't know either one

532.399 --> 539.279
let me see let me see what imdb says

536.88 --> 539.279
about it

539.44 --> 541.7600000000001
uh

545.76 --> 550.88
wow some people out there with fireworks

548.56 --> 550.88
a lot

558.44 --> 563.839
2011 wow that's some time ago

578.399 --> 580.64
what

584.64 --> 587.12
oh wait

589.519 --> 593.04
what is this

593.68 --> 597.279
yeah nicholas cage that's the guy i

595.76 --> 600.56
don't know why i forgot that name but

597.279 --> 605.8389999999999
he's like the main character in here

600.56 --> 605.8389999999999
and he's pretty damn gritty

608.399 --> 614.0
but i i think that he was probably

610.64 --> 615.92
pretty well cast for that role

614.0 --> 619.839
because he is already kind of crazy

615.92 --> 619.8389999999999
action guy

620.32 --> 626.8000000000001
yes huh anyway

624.0 --> 629.2
i haven't finished watching it i was to

626.8 --> 630.959
be fair i was much more impressed about

629.2 --> 632.9590000000001
the south park pandemic special

630.959 --> 635.5999999999999
especially because i didn't expect it to

632.959 --> 638.16
be that good

635.6 --> 639.279
it you know every time i see a episode

638.16 --> 642.0
from south park

639.279 --> 643.8389999999999
from the mid from them like that every

642.0 --> 647.2
time i get the feeling like oh

643.839 --> 649.7600000000001
god at least they haven't like

647.2 --> 650.9590000000001
lost their spark you know at least they

649.76 --> 654.72
haven't

650.959 --> 656.3199999999999
died their spirit hasn't died they can

654.72 --> 659.44
still do it

656.32 --> 659.6800000000001
so yeah if you haven't watched that one

659.44 --> 663.12
i

659.68 --> 663.12
absolutely recommend it

663.92 --> 666.7199999999999
like really

670.8 --> 675.8389999999999
hey seeking star water

679.279 --> 684.24
anyway yeah that that's it for the notes

681.6 --> 689.839
i didn't make a lot of notes

684.24 --> 689.839
i yeah there was no ball busters live

691.36 --> 697.839
uh i think you know i almost

695.519 --> 698.8
these days i almost stopped making notes

697.839 --> 701.7600000000001
because it

698.8 --> 702.56
it's like every there's so many uh

701.76 --> 706.079
streams that

702.56 --> 708.16
rodrigo ferrari nunez does

706.079 --> 709.92
and i like to pop on to them because i

708.16 --> 712.24
just like hanging around there

709.92 --> 715.5999999999999
a lot because he's a guy that

712.24 --> 718.32
appreciates my comments

715.6 --> 719.44
and i don't know i think our energies

718.32 --> 722.5600000000001
just blend in

719.44 --> 722.5600000000001
okay like we

725.68 --> 730.2399999999999
i think he's an awesome guy and i think

727.839 --> 734.32
that his dreams are a lot of fun

730.24 --> 738.32
just he does reviewing of

734.32 --> 745.839
just the silliest space [ __ ] ever

738.32 --> 745.839
and it's just hilarious to be there

749.12 --> 755.68
yeah anyway i hope everyone is well

753.6 --> 759.2
i keep forgetting like yesterday's

755.68 --> 760.88
episode pretty much revealed that

759.2 --> 763.6
like the end of summer is kind of

760.88 --> 767.04
pressing on a lot of people

763.6 --> 772.8000000000001
to deal with issues again and [ __ ] so i

767.04 --> 776.8
indeed i will keep that in mind and just

772.8 --> 776.8
be a bit of a caretaker i guess

781.04 --> 786.24
or at least available for that but i

784.079 --> 788.0
hope you guys are all doing well

786.24 --> 790.0
there's is there something specific on

788.0 --> 793.2
your mind your mind

790.0 --> 793.2
you want me to discuss

794.8 --> 798.7199999999999
if all possible i'd like to keep it calm

797.279 --> 800.88
and not get into

798.72 --> 802.1600000000001
uh just endless back and forth with

800.88 --> 804.32
ballers

802.16 --> 807.279
if you don't mind you know had a lot of

804.32 --> 807.279
that in the recent week

810.0 --> 815.36
oh you're golden oh that sounds that

812.639 --> 818.399
sounds great

815.36 --> 821.44
hope i am as well well i'm

818.399 --> 825.12
having kind of nah having a spiritually

821.44 --> 825.12
rough time my body is doing well

826.16 --> 829.68
you know usually during this time i get

829.199 --> 832.4799999999999
to

829.68 --> 833.92
remember i don't want to remember you

832.48 --> 836.24
probably don't either

833.92 --> 838.16
but like periodically i get like skin

836.24 --> 842.399
problems

838.16 --> 845.4399999999999
well they haven't come so far they had

842.399 --> 846.24
something it's like this sensitivity

845.44 --> 849.12
again

846.24 --> 849.6
but it's not really acting out as much

849.12 --> 852.8
so i'm

849.6 --> 852.8000000000001
very happy about that

853.44 --> 857.44
but yeah uh psychologically or

855.6 --> 859.839
spiritually there is a lot of

857.44 --> 862.9590000000001
yeah turbulence going on just like

859.839 --> 862.9590000000001
outside right now

863.68 --> 869.279
and even though darkness when it arrives

867.199 --> 872.3199999999999
doesn't seem to stick as much

869.279 --> 873.76
which i'm very happy about it does get

872.32 --> 876.88
me restless and it does

873.76 --> 879.92
sometimes pull me back into

876.88 --> 883.279
those previous

879.92 --> 885.5999999999999
mindsets and ideas

883.279 --> 888.48
then i have to pull myself out again and

885.6 --> 891.6
just literally forget about that

888.48 --> 895.6800000000001
consider it as a reversed world illusion

891.6 --> 897.279
that came out of me from early on

895.68 --> 899.92
it's very tough to deal with that

897.279 --> 902.399
sometimes but

899.92 --> 904.399
i'm i'm yeah i'm doing okay like i had

902.399 --> 906.16
one of those moments last night

904.399 --> 908.399
like right when i was going to bed

906.16 --> 910.639
despite only watching half that movie

908.399 --> 913.36
but that movie already reminded me too

910.639 --> 915.6
much about things that

913.36 --> 917.44
i don't want to become be conscious

915.6 --> 920.88
about too much

917.44 --> 927.839
because it just makes me feel very eerie

920.88 --> 927.8389999999999
and reminds me of a period in the past

928.959 --> 937.68
anyway but i got through that

933.92 --> 938.3199999999999
i prayed too just thought about

937.68 --> 940.959
everything i

938.32 --> 942.0
learned about how things work and then

940.959 --> 945.92
realized oh

942.0 --> 948.959
i have so much more grip on

945.92 --> 955.199
how to deal with this and yeah

948.959 --> 957.8389999999999
i'm doing pretty good this morning

955.199 --> 959.519
also i haven't really had a lot of calls

957.839 --> 963.519
with my healer

959.519 --> 963.519
you know remember that

963.839 --> 970.24
despite having pretty yeah

967.839 --> 971.6
scares sometimes although not really

970.24 --> 973.92
scarce anymore it's just

971.6 --> 976.32
more burdening it's not the scary don't

973.92 --> 980.24
get the scare anymore as much

976.32 --> 983.759
that like no shock effect as much

980.24 --> 986.48
so i don't know

983.759 --> 989.36
to me that's a good sign that i i don't

986.48 --> 989.36
need him as much

991.279 --> 997.68
right so that's my proof that i am

994.399 --> 1001.36
actually doing good uh

997.68 --> 1001.3599999999999
hello matthew eastman

1006.079 --> 1025.839
you follow the sun okay

1011.04 --> 1025.839
you'll never reach it though

1036.839 --> 1039.839
uh

1043.839 --> 1046.6399999999999
so yeah uh

1047.28 --> 1056.08
guys i'm up for subject

1052.4 --> 1056.0800000000002
can get technical if you like

1056.16 --> 1060.16
or discuss events out there

1061.6 --> 1066.9599999999998
this weird new ploy going down in

1065.28 --> 1069.039
politics

1066.96 --> 1070.16
apparently with yeah trump has a cold i

1069.039 --> 1073.28
already knew that but

1070.16 --> 1075.52
yeah looked a little deeper into it

1073.28 --> 1076.8799999999999
but he is weird because he's getting

1075.52 --> 1080.72
these

1076.88 --> 1082.88
well never tested experimental drugs

1080.72 --> 1086.799
before

1082.88 --> 1090.0
and that's kind of out of proportion

1086.799 --> 1093.2
that seems like overkill and

1090.0 --> 1094.48
yeah that's weird that that that's

1093.2 --> 1097.679
happening it probably

1094.48 --> 1101.039
gonna turn out to be just fine

1097.679 --> 1104.4
i hope but

1101.039 --> 1108.96
it seems like almost

1104.4 --> 1121.919
an unusually dramatic way to go about

1108.96 --> 1124.24
because it's not that dangerous come on

1121.919 --> 1127.039
right

1124.24 --> 1131.039
anybody else think that yeah that the

1127.039 --> 1131.039
treatment he's getting is a bit overkill

1131.12 --> 1135.6
and yeah we don't even really know what

1133.52 --> 1138.32
what it's doing anyway

1135.6 --> 1140.24
so i don't know i know it may be

1138.32 --> 1142.799
described somewhere in detail i haven't

1140.24 --> 1142.799
looked it up

1143.36 --> 1147.76
avoiding cold weather yeah that seems

1145.28 --> 1147.76
sensible

1148.24 --> 1151.84
and thank you for the peace and

1149.6 --> 1156.32
tranquility

1151.84 --> 1156.32
you think it's fake could be

1160.96 --> 1166.32
he doesn't have anything why haven't

1162.559 --> 1166.32
seen him in in a

1167.2 --> 1174.32
he doesn't i haven't seen him

1170.96 --> 1174.72
looking like if he had a cold so i don't

1174.32 --> 1176.799
know

1174.72 --> 1178.799
it could be could be good servant it

1176.799 --> 1182.16
could be just a

1178.799 --> 1184.4
an an escape up like

1182.16 --> 1187.28
get out of out of the pressure for a

1184.4 --> 1187.2800000000002
while or something

1188.64 --> 1195.8400000000001
maybe he needs to like

1192.16 --> 1199.2
charge his verbal battery

1195.84 --> 1202.1589999999999
his his focus basically on on his

1199.2 --> 1206.96
quality and that in his planning

1202.159 --> 1210.3200000000002
for for some yeah the coming period

1206.96 --> 1214.159
maybe that's why he's doing it

1210.32 --> 1214.1589999999999
i don't know could be all kinds of

1218.84 --> 1224.9599999999998
reasons

1221.44 --> 1224.96
isn't a fire need

1228.24 --> 1232.24
well maybe goddess which bella but at

1230.24 --> 1235.679
the same time trump's also been

1232.24 --> 1239.6
like promoting defect the just even

1235.679 --> 1239.6000000000001
calling it the vaccine at this point

1239.679 --> 1244.4
and then spreading it with the military

1242.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
you know like remember that

1244.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
so yeah he's

1250.0 --> 1263.84
he's playing games

1271.039 --> 1277.52
he didn't have his orange paint on what

1274.32 --> 1277.52
this agent

1279.2 --> 1281.919
oh god

1286.96 --> 1291.8400000000001
well maybe he's just sick of being

1288.64 --> 1291.8400000000001
orange man all the time

1292.799 --> 1296.8799999999999
you know it's pretty tough being like

1297.28 --> 1302.8799999999999
a really bad boogeyman in media

1300.96 --> 1304.48
it is kind of pressing because like you

1302.88 --> 1308.7990000000002
get faced with that

1304.48 --> 1312.0
stuff that frequency so much

1308.799 --> 1312.0
one way or the other

1313.84 --> 1318.0
his face was as white was white as a

1316.88 --> 1320.3200000000002
sheet

1318.0 --> 1320.32
hmm

1325.039 --> 1333.84
okay but when was that

1340.88 --> 1347.679
huh oh that's funny god is rich bella

1343.12 --> 1351.1999999999998
maybe maybe i can help you out maybe

1347.679 --> 1351.6000000000001
he is in the elite and he is against

1351.2 --> 1361.1200000000001
them

1351.6 --> 1364.559
ever considered that

1361.12 --> 1367.6789999999999
i think it's one way to consider it is

1364.559 --> 1367.6789999999999
that he's basically

1368.159 --> 1374.0
a rebellious new

1371.44 --> 1376.48
he's trying to be a rebellious new

1374.0 --> 1378.559
compartment from within the virtual

1376.48 --> 1380.4
nobility structure that is there

1378.559 --> 1382.1589999999999
covertly

1380.4 --> 1384.48
i think that is actually what he's

1382.159 --> 1388.7990000000002
trying it's not ending the deep state

1384.48 --> 1392.88
he's basically

1388.799 --> 1396.8799999999999
trying to insert new players in there

1392.88 --> 1398.64
that'll do a better job kind of

1396.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
i don't know that's what it seems like

1398.64 --> 1403.8400000000001
to me

1407.84 --> 1410.9599999999998
and it would also explain why he's been

1410.32 --> 1414.84
so

1410.96 --> 1417.8400000000001
unbelievably tolerant about certain

1414.84 --> 1417.84
issues

1418.48 --> 1423.44
like unreasonably tolerant in my opinion

1421.279 --> 1423.44
but

1423.73 --> 1428.32
[Music]

1426.08 --> 1430.08
it just seems like he's always trying to

1428.32 --> 1432.3999999999999
work with them

1430.08 --> 1435.6
instead of going after them even though

1432.4 --> 1438.64
verbally he is against them and all that

1435.6 --> 1443.52
i don't know but

1438.64 --> 1446.0
it's all just speculation you know

1443.52 --> 1447.279
and that could also be it that he's just

1446.0 --> 1450.159
scattergunning

1447.279 --> 1452.96
so in confusion with everything and just

1450.159 --> 1455.44
gonna follow through with his plan which

1452.96 --> 1456.159
we don't know what it is but we can

1455.44 --> 1460.0800000000002
speculate

1456.159 --> 1473.8400000000001
endlessly on and thereby being stuck

1460.08 --> 1473.84
speculating about it endlessly

1475.12 --> 1479.6789999999999
yeah well i don't blame you for thinking

1477.44 --> 1483.2
that goddess which bella

1479.679 --> 1483.2
it does seem like that

1484.84 --> 1487.84
sometimes

1510.48 --> 1515.84
hello mr jones

1516.96 --> 1519.76
oh look at that

1522.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
how quickly it changes right guys look

1525.36 --> 1529.84
at that

1530.32 --> 1534.32
that looks completely different

1534.48 --> 1543.84
within the time span of just 20 minutes

1554.84 --> 1557.84
right

1564.4 --> 1569.279
yeah mr jones i don't think we can see

1566.799 --> 1569.279
that far

1569.36 --> 1574.6399999999999
i think refraction limits our line of

1571.76 --> 1577.12
sight even upwards

1574.64 --> 1584.0800000000002
whatever the container outlining may be

1577.12 --> 1587.6
it's simply out of our sight

1584.08 --> 1590.32
and there's no light reaching

1587.6 --> 1591.6
there you know the the starlight the

1590.32 --> 1593.9189999999999
sunlight

1591.6 --> 1595.039
that that holographic light yeah that's

1593.919 --> 1596.88
reaching us you know

1595.039 --> 1598.72
and it seems like the closer you get to

1596.88 --> 1601.7600000000002
earth the intenser it is

1598.72 --> 1606.64
so it's like light manifest well that

1601.76 --> 1606.64
light is not going upward

1607.12 --> 1611.4399999999998
so there's no light shining on the

1609.76 --> 1613.679
container

1611.44 --> 1614.72
literally it's it should be perfectly

1613.679 --> 1616.4
black there

1614.72 --> 1618.32
because there's no light going there and

1616.4 --> 1619.919
any light that comes from earth is not

1618.32 --> 1622.559
going to reach it

1619.919 --> 1624.5590000000002
although i don't know technically maybe

1622.559 --> 1628.6399999999999
a super strong

1624.559 --> 1628.6399999999999
bright laser or something could be

1629.36 --> 1634.08
made to touch it and then it becomes

1631.919 --> 1637.2
another question is it transparent

1634.08 --> 1639.6
or is it not but there's no light

1637.2 --> 1640.88
reaching it in order for us to see the

1639.6 --> 1644.0
container

1640.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
instead we get to see the blue

1644.0 --> 1655.84
sky effect

1661.76 --> 1667.279
trump's u.s space force fake too yes oh

1664.88 --> 1667.279
yes

1667.36 --> 1671.76
but there there's still a group of

1670.0 --> 1672.32
people that have an agenda that do

1671.76 --> 1675.2
something

1672.32 --> 1677.2
it's has just hasn't to do anything with

1675.2 --> 1681.039
space maybe

1677.2 --> 1683.76
the what do you call that the region

1681.039 --> 1685.919
the designation of what is considered

1683.76 --> 1689.52
space so maybe they have to do with

1685.919 --> 1694.159
high high air regions

1689.52 --> 1698.1589999999999
like territory of the balloon spy planes

1694.159 --> 1700.0
blimps maybe they're about that

1698.159 --> 1703.2
and they're probably since it is

1700.0 --> 1706.88
designated space parts

1703.2 --> 1710.52
might occupy themselves with

1706.88 --> 1713.7600000000002
with some uh

1710.52 --> 1715.679
nasa-related trickery or uh how do you

1713.76 --> 1719.76
call that a promotion type of thing

1715.679 --> 1723.2
media they're probably a media apparatus

1719.76 --> 1726.8799999999999
to basically support nasa and maybe

1723.2 --> 1730.24
relating just relating to air force just

1726.88 --> 1732.48
like nasa also relates to that

1730.24 --> 1732.48
so

1734.64 --> 1738.0
but yeah there's no guarantee that

1736.559 --> 1743.039
there's actually even going

1738.0 --> 1743.039
to be a a functioning

1743.2 --> 1750.0800000000002
system like that it could simply just be

1746.48 --> 1752.0
a pure media op media people just

1750.08 --> 1757.6
putting out the idea of there being

1752.0 --> 1757.6
a space force you know we don't know yet

1759.36 --> 1763.12
but the funding seems to be there for it

1762.08 --> 1765.6789999999999
at least

1763.12 --> 1767.6789999999999
so who knows you know space force could

1765.679 --> 1769.44
also be a cover

1767.679 --> 1771.919
for something completely different it

1769.44 --> 1771.919
might be

1772.08 --> 1776.08
well remember just like basically the

1774.64 --> 1779.679
democrats

1776.08 --> 1780.24
have put the left behind system a lot of

1779.679 --> 1783.44
money

1780.24 --> 1786.559
like a lot of money went in there

1783.44 --> 1789.44
the the left behind people that have now

1786.559 --> 1791.44
caused all this ruckus against the trump

1789.44 --> 1793.8400000000001
administration

1791.44 --> 1796.0
throughout the entire four years as it

1793.84 --> 1798.1589999999999
were

1796.0 --> 1801.36
and the media onto that and everything

1798.159 --> 1805.679
corporation everybody not cooperating

1801.36 --> 1809.279
well maybe space force is trump's

1805.679 --> 1810.159
stay behind plan as it were so something

1809.279 --> 1813.279
similar

1810.159 --> 1816.3990000000001
except it's not through deep state cia

1813.279 --> 1817.279
things and all that it's through space

1816.399 --> 1821.6
force

1817.279 --> 1837.84
who knows you know you'll find out

1821.6 --> 1837.84
sure you will and so will it

1843.44 --> 1848.0
oh wow and ball that's special

1848.84 --> 1856.1589999999999
so satellite dishes

1851.52 --> 1858.72
pointing south why don't they point up

1856.159 --> 1862.0
why don't they just point up you know

1858.72 --> 1864.159
satellites are supposedly above us right

1862.0 --> 1866.159
i've never seen those those types of

1864.159 --> 1871.279
dishes ever point

1866.159 --> 1874.88
up they're always like this

1871.279 --> 1878.32
this they're never like this never

1874.88 --> 1881.44
so is this

1878.32 --> 1885.76
so yeah pointing to some tower somewhere

1881.44 --> 1885.76
in the distance probably out of visual

1890.84 --> 1893.84
sight

1895.36 --> 1900.4799999999998
on the equator they point up oh sure

1900.559 --> 1904.1589999999999
i'm sure they do

1905.519 --> 1909.039
no i don't think so

1919.2 --> 1924.32
i'm not gonna check it i'd i'd like to

1922.24 --> 1924.64
see some evidence for that you know i'm

1924.32 --> 1935.84
not

1924.64 --> 1935.8400000000001
at the equator

1946.84 --> 1949.84
now

1960.84 --> 1963.84
no

1978.96 --> 1985.1200000000001
oh point to the equator oh that's odd

1982.64 --> 1985.1200000000001
isn't it

1985.2 --> 1991.8400000000001
why would all dishes point to the

1987.279 --> 1991.84
equator then

1992.96 --> 1997.279
aren't like the supposed satellites

1995.519 --> 2000.48
spread all over

1997.279 --> 2000.88
the globe or everywhere or because yeah

2000.48 --> 2002.96
if they're

2000.88 --> 2004.24
all pointing there all of them that's

2002.96 --> 2007.6000000000001
that's

2004.24 --> 2011.1200000000001
weird almost seems like there's only one

2007.6 --> 2013.9189999999999
satellite one relay then in that case

2011.12 --> 2019.84
how does that work i thought there were

2013.919 --> 2019.8400000000001
like tens of thousands of these things

2027.36 --> 2032.1589999999999
it is interesting you know because who

2029.679 --> 2035.519
knows maybe they have found a way to

2032.159 --> 2037.2
well bounce off the barrier

2035.519 --> 2038.559
or the stratosphere as they call it

2037.2 --> 2041.039
maybe they figured out a way to

2038.559 --> 2041.039
basically

2042.159 --> 2050.7200000000003
direct it at a specific point

2047.6 --> 2061.839
and then that will cause it to

2050.72 --> 2061.839
wave out everywhere

2064.079 --> 2069.76
this is ridiculous embl

2067.52 --> 2071.839
look you're breaking your own argument

2069.76 --> 2074.96
here

2071.839 --> 2077.7599999999998
what satellites all these supposed

2074.96 --> 2079.679
satellites right so are you saying that

2077.76 --> 2081.44
all the satellites are only there at the

2079.679 --> 2086.159
equator

2081.44 --> 2089.2000000000003
that that doesn't match the narrative

2086.159 --> 2091.44
that's not what's going on

2089.2 --> 2093.839
why would all the dishes all point to

2091.44 --> 2095.76
the same region

2093.839 --> 2097.7599999999998
when there's tens of thousands of these

2095.76 --> 2101.28
supposed satellites up there

2097.76 --> 2104.6400000000003
everywhere everywhere

2101.28 --> 2104.6400000000003
so that doesn't make any sense

2107.599 --> 2112.0
they bounce radio waves off the dome

2109.599 --> 2112.4
well that's another way of putting it i

2112.0 --> 2114.16
don't

2112.4 --> 2116.32
necessarily want to call it a dome but

2114.16 --> 2119.7599999999998
it could be

2116.32 --> 2131.839
that it is being reflected off something

2119.76 --> 2131.8390000000004
up there

2133.92 --> 2138.8
oh don't don't give him that agm

2140.32 --> 2144.0
there's no orbits there's no things

2142.72 --> 2147.359
there's something hanging up

2144.0 --> 2149.839
there it will come down eventually so

2147.359 --> 2152.7999999999997
they would have to replace that

2149.839 --> 2154.0789999999997
but they could simply not need that at

2152.8 --> 2156.7200000000003
all

2154.079 --> 2158.6400000000003
besides well you did they don't need it

2156.72 --> 2161.7599999999998
they can use towers

2158.64 --> 2161.7599999999998
but for this big

2161.92 --> 2168.0
i don't know global big

2165.68 --> 2170.56
yeah the entire world's fanning signal

2168.0 --> 2174.16
maybe they figured out how to

2170.56 --> 2174.16
reflect it up there

2174.8 --> 2187.8390000000004
and then get it to reach everywhere

2177.04 --> 2187.839
maybe they figured out how to do this

2198.839 --> 2201.839
okay

2205.92 --> 2212.7200000000003
only a few hundred for tv

2209.52 --> 2216.64
so are at least few hundred forty feet

2212.72 --> 2216.64
only hanging over the equator

2218.0 --> 2229.839
is that official

2238.8 --> 2243.8390000000004
yes okay sure

2282.839 --> 2286.7999999999997
yes mr ball

2287.68 --> 2299.839
of course i've used google street view

2308.079 --> 2313.8390000000004
what passenger what

2329.92 --> 2336.8
yeah bandsaw bandit well yeah globers

2333.599 --> 2339.119
they like to think about satellites more

2336.8 --> 2341.04
make them dream about the space you know

2339.119 --> 2344.56
it's their escapist mechanism

2341.04 --> 2347.599
so they like to dwell in on that

2344.56 --> 2348.96
on that toy a virtual toy in their mind

2347.599 --> 2352.96
they like to dwell on that

2348.96 --> 2355.52
a lot more than scary social engineering

2352.96 --> 2369.839
devil politics

2355.52 --> 2369.839
so it doesn't surprise me at all

2379.2 --> 2387.4399999999996
said you don't stop stop

2382.4 --> 2387.44
agitating my my chat please

2388.079 --> 2397.8390000000004
don't go chevagne in here that's i don't

2391.28 --> 2397.8390000000004
tolerate that

2398.04 --> 2401.5099999999998
[Music]

2436.839 --> 2441.119
so

2438.24 --> 2441.1189999999997
oh god

2444.72 --> 2453.839
i don't care who started it

2464.839 --> 2467.839
so

2475.68 --> 2480.64
god seriously why would you want a tv

2478.839 --> 2495.839
anyway

2480.64 --> 2495.839
you got internet

2503.52 --> 2510.56
how long till the cashless society

2507.04 --> 2516.24
well no that's

2510.56 --> 2516.24
that's not gonna happen not for a long

2520.839 --> 2523.839
time

2524.48 --> 2531.76
at least for the next few years i'd say

2528.0 --> 2534.24
let's hope it takes a little longer

2531.76 --> 2535.28
but i'll bet you there will be plenty of

2534.24 --> 2538.72
uh

2535.28 --> 2538.7200000000003
currency revolutions

2540.079 --> 2551.8390000000004
i'm sure there will be

2576.48 --> 2579.599
well goddess which bella maybe you

2578.0 --> 2580.72
should look at it from a slightly

2579.599 --> 2584.079
different perspective

2580.72 --> 2589.839
and realize that not trying to convince

2584.079 --> 2589.8390000000004
us on trying to convince themselves

2590.839 --> 2595.2799999999997
see they're stuck

2596.079 --> 2601.8390000000004
they want their fantasy to become

2598.24 --> 2601.839
reality so they preach it

2605.68 --> 2609.52
when you look at it like that then

2607.2 --> 2612.3999999999996
they're not doing any they're just

2609.52 --> 2612.96
they're doing it for them not not to

2612.4 --> 2615.359
alter

2612.96 --> 2617.44
your mind they would be completely

2615.359 --> 2619.52
baffled if that would even happen

2617.44 --> 2621.04
because it's the process isn't really

2619.52 --> 2624.079
about social interaction

2621.04 --> 2628.079
it's about resolving their own

2624.079 --> 2628.079
virtue signaling to their own fantasy

2628.24 --> 2635.839
to emphasize that they do believe in it

2631.92 --> 2635.839
i'm not really trying to convince you

2653.2 --> 2663.839
yeah yeah hey hey again nathan

2657.359 --> 2663.839
see you're listening

2670.56 --> 2677.839
yeah exactly

2697.079 --> 2705.8390000000004
terrestrial land level

2700.48 --> 2705.839
radio signals

2707.92 --> 2711.44
i wonder like uh

2712.16 --> 2720.72
would be interesting to try to see

2715.68 --> 2720.72
how the signal could be triangulated

2725.359 --> 2733.119
wouldn't you say like if these dishes

2728.96 --> 2736.319
are all supposedly going to the equator

2733.119 --> 2738.56
how does that work where is the signal

2736.319 --> 2740.88
actually coming from

2738.56 --> 2744.319
would be very interesting to have like a

2740.88 --> 2744.319
heavy battery drone

2745.44 --> 2749.52
i self-controlling or how do i know how

2746.88 --> 2753.119
that will work but that could basically

2749.52 --> 2755.119
follow the signal from a dish

2753.119 --> 2758.48
and then literally try to keep following

2755.119 --> 2762.48
the signal to see where it's coming from

2758.48 --> 2766.2400000000002
to zone in on the signal and then

2762.48 --> 2770.16
yeah trace the path that it's following

2766.24 --> 2773.52
in a euclidean sense then see okay

2770.16 --> 2774.96
maybe it the signal actually does bend

2773.52 --> 2777.7599999999998
or something

2774.96 --> 2779.599
and then it can be triangulated to

2777.76 --> 2783.3590000000004
towers

2779.599 --> 2784.0
at an enormous distance maybe there is

2783.359 --> 2786.96
like a

2784.0 --> 2788.88
like a row of towers built at the

2786.96 --> 2791.599
equator line

2788.88 --> 2793.839
that are doing this they're sending out

2791.599 --> 2796.6400000000003
these signals very high towers like in

2793.839 --> 2802.64
africa and south america

2796.64 --> 2806.7999999999997
and uh where is it

2802.64 --> 2806.7999999999997
like around southeast asia and all that

2806.88 --> 2811.839
india maybe something like that i don't

2814.839 --> 2817.839
know

2830.56 --> 2832.7999999999997
hmm

2838.88 --> 2847.04
but yeah that's a good point about reach

2842.64 --> 2847.04
with the supposed satellite dish

2847.2 --> 2852.319
dishes for for tv signals right

2850.559 --> 2854.6400000000003
you would have to be able if that's

2852.319 --> 2856.64
really literally coming from satellites

2854.64 --> 2858.0
up there from very far away at the

2856.64 --> 2860.319
equator line then

2858.0 --> 2862.319
you should be able to pick it up

2860.319 --> 2865.359
everywhere

2862.319 --> 2865.359
almost everywhere

2869.2 --> 2875.4399999999996
and like would mountain ridges

2873.68 --> 2878.3999999999996
even matter that much unless they were

2875.44 --> 2878.4
like really high

2883.68 --> 2886.72
as long as you are basically on a

2885.68 --> 2890.319
plateau

2886.72 --> 2893.52
type region you should always be able to

2890.319 --> 2893.52
receive those signals

2898.16 --> 2901.839
is that really the case

2926.839 --> 2929.839
what

2939.04 --> 2942.5589999999997
[Music]

2940.839 --> 2944.5589999999997
right

2942.559 --> 2946.48
well it isn't it would be interesting to

2944.559 --> 2949.119
like maybe at some point

2946.48 --> 2951.44
really dig into it but this is not

2949.119 --> 2957.839
something that i would do

2951.44 --> 2957.839
maybe something like jaren would do that

2961.28 --> 2971.8390000000004
then just get it all worked out like

2963.839 --> 2971.839
where is this signal really coming from

2997.2 --> 3001.359
internet plus smart devices

3018.72 --> 3022.319
haha good point wait goddess which

3020.4 --> 3024.7200000000003
valley yeah yeah

3022.319 --> 3026.0
yeah it's all nice and dandy all this

3024.72 --> 3028.48
technology that

3026.0 --> 3030.0
their science has given them right

3028.48 --> 3031.76
that's how they like to say it

3030.0 --> 3033.2
or at least they used to they probably

3031.76 --> 3037.119
still do

3033.2 --> 3040.7999999999997
they're not around us but

3037.119 --> 3044.319
yeah when it comes to ground level

3040.8 --> 3046.2400000000002
data like the missing curvature and all

3044.319 --> 3048.24
that and how that works with geometry

3046.24 --> 3051.9199999999996
yeah they don't like to talk about that

3048.24 --> 3055.2799999999997
anymore like to stay up there

3051.92 --> 3057.2000000000003
just walk outside and imagine

3055.28 --> 3059.0400000000004
the earth being a ball underneath your

3057.2 --> 3060.96
feet

3059.04 --> 3062.48
and the air sticking to it and then the

3060.96 --> 3064.64
vastness of outer space

3062.48 --> 3066.4
out there an endless vacuum and more

3064.64 --> 3068.8799999999997
balls and

3066.4 --> 3070.64
yeah because that's much easier than

3068.88 --> 3072.6400000000003
actually confronting yourself with the

3070.64 --> 3075.1189999999997
natural consequences of

3072.64 --> 3075.1189999999997
claims

3080.839 --> 3083.839
yep

3108.839 --> 3114.96
hmm

3111.2 --> 3117.9199999999996
okay so embol if it works to get

3114.96 --> 3119.599
tv it works so what works the

3117.92 --> 3122.2400000000002
instructions work

3119.599 --> 3124.48
or the pre-assumption that the signal is

3122.24 --> 3128.0
coming from satellites

3124.48 --> 3130.319
somewhere at the equator over the ball

3128.0 --> 3130.319
earth

3130.4 --> 3136.4
which of the two makes it work

3134.4 --> 3138.64
i think it's following the instruction

3136.4 --> 3139.52
ones i don't think that the imagination

3138.64 --> 3141.7599999999998
of

3139.52 --> 3144.4
how it's supposed to work really comes

3141.76 --> 3144.4
into play

3145.119 --> 3153.839
you don't prove those conceptions

3148.96 --> 3153.839
by installing a satellite dish

3164.61 --> 3167.7490000000003
[Music]

3171.359 --> 3175.52
now seeking star wars i wouldn't go that

3173.52 --> 3178.839
far i don't think anything is

3175.52 --> 3181.92
behind a hologram

3178.839 --> 3186.0789999999997
really or maybe

3181.92 --> 3186.079
with rainbows is not entirely true

3186.64 --> 3191.839
and everything is behind it usually

3192.839 --> 3197.2
but as for the sun

3195.04 --> 3198.16
i don't know i think it's at the edge of

3197.2 --> 3200.72
vision so

3198.16 --> 3202.48
if there is something behind it you

3200.72 --> 3208.14
would never see it

3202.48 --> 3211.239
because it's out of sight

3208.14 --> 3211.239
[Music]

3232.49 --> 3237.839
[Music]

3234.839 --> 3237.839
hmm

3240.33 --> 3243.88
[Music]

3258.8 --> 3263.04
what are you supposed to think well

3261.359 --> 3265.119
you're supposed to think that you are

3263.04 --> 3268.0
getting a signal from that direction

3265.119 --> 3270.079
and that then your imagination about

3268.0 --> 3273.2
what that really means

3270.079 --> 3273.8390000000004
because of your circumdicular geometry

3273.2 --> 3276.0
thinking

3273.839 --> 3277.359
and calculus because you do that

3276.0 --> 3280.16
constantly

3277.359 --> 3280.88
you can simply warp any observation of a

3280.16 --> 3284.16
direction

3280.88 --> 3285.6800000000003
into your ball conception geometry of

3284.16 --> 3288.5589999999997
the world

3285.68 --> 3292.48
that's what you do it doesn't actually

3288.559 --> 3294.799
prove it though

3292.48 --> 3297.28
it's still just coming from that

3294.799 --> 3301.599
direction now what that actually means

3297.28 --> 3301.599
that depends on your vantage point

3301.76 --> 3305.0400000000004
for how you're going to

3305.2 --> 3311.52
perceive the world if you're gonna

3308.72 --> 3312.0
immediately apply terrestrial refraction

3311.52 --> 3314.24
and

3312.0 --> 3315.28
perpendicular geometry turn the earth

3314.24 --> 3319.7599999999998
into a ball

3315.28 --> 3321.3590000000004
beneath you despite the black swan

3319.76 --> 3322.7990000000004
and terrestrial refraction being a

3321.359 --> 3325.92
paradox

3322.799 --> 3330.559
yeah then yeah you might be able to

3325.92 --> 3332.839
imagine that that can work

3330.559 --> 3335.2000000000003
with your satellites over the equator or

3332.839 --> 3337.52
whatever

3335.2 --> 3338.3999999999996
but when you don't use that vantage

3337.52 --> 3340.96
point and just

3338.4 --> 3342.88
think euclidean you know like all the

3340.96 --> 3346.7200000000003
data that's actually used in

3342.88 --> 3350.48
in triangulation and gps and all that

3346.72 --> 3352.64
then it might turn out that it's

3350.48 --> 3354.88
can be explained in another fashion as

3352.64 --> 3354.8799999999997
well

3355.599 --> 3359.599
now in order to actually figure out how

3358.4 --> 3362.559
it works

3359.599 --> 3363.52
you would have to have like a drone with

3362.559 --> 3367.3590000000004
a

3363.52 --> 3370.559
with a small satellite dish on it

3367.359 --> 3373.2799999999997
to basically trace the signal

3370.559 --> 3374.88
where you install it in your house out

3373.28 --> 3376.88
of your window or something

3374.88 --> 3380.0
and then you send the drone to basically

3376.88 --> 3380.0
follow that signal

3381.2 --> 3387.2799999999997
and then see if that signal is in a

3383.76 --> 3387.28
literal straight path

3388.079 --> 3392.1600000000003
from the satellite dish installed at

3390.72 --> 3393.2799999999997
your house and if you can then just

3392.16 --> 3395.44
trace the signal

3393.28 --> 3397.52
find out if it's actually going in a

3395.44 --> 3400.559
geometrical literal line

3397.52 --> 3403.839
can gps trace it you can literally

3400.559 --> 3406.96
live on air as you do that gps trace

3403.839 --> 3410.0789999999997
its its path the drone as as

3406.96 --> 3411.119
it follows the signal the satellite dish

3410.079 --> 3413.92
signal and then you can

3411.119 --> 3414.6400000000003
see whether it is a literal straight

3413.92 --> 3416.96
line or

3414.64 --> 3418.16
whether it is going slightly curved more

3416.96 --> 3421.119
and more and it will go

3418.16 --> 3424.5589999999997
more horizontal and end up if you

3421.119 --> 3428.079
continue that line at a certain

3424.559 --> 3430.4
radio tower for example

3428.079 --> 3432.4
you know it's good to actually test

3430.4 --> 3435.44
these things if you can

3432.4 --> 3437.839
because it might yield some interesting

3435.44 --> 3437.839
data

3439.44 --> 3443.119
or you could just apply circumndecular

3441.28 --> 3444.0
geometry imagine the earth as a globe

3443.119 --> 3446.48
and that

3444.0 --> 3448.4
it's coming from satellites you can

3446.48 --> 3450.64
imagine that all day long it's very easy

3448.4 --> 3454.4
to do that

3450.64 --> 3455.839
all the tools we've received in order to

3454.4 --> 3458.559
imagine that

3455.839 --> 3460.4
but if you actually want to know how it

3458.559 --> 3463.2000000000003
really works what's really going on you

3460.4 --> 3463.2000000000003
got to test it

3463.44 --> 3466.48
and yeah i just described a way it could

3466.0 --> 3468.72
be

3466.48 --> 3472.559
tested where is it really coming from

3468.72 --> 3472.5589999999997
how does the signal path work

3473.359 --> 3476.88
all right gathering data it's always

3476.4 --> 3489.839
good to

3476.88 --> 3489.839
actually figure out how things work

3494.319 --> 3503.839
no earth passenger no

3515.44 --> 3519.44
oh michael jones what i'm suggesting is

3518.0 --> 3522.72
that you don't even need

3519.44 --> 3522.7200000000003
freaking balloons for that

3523.04 --> 3527.92
i think balloons can be applied and

3525.119 --> 3531.839
probably are here and there

3527.92 --> 3531.839
they think the vast majority

3531.92 --> 3538.64
they just use towers

3535.359 --> 3539.52
but in order to establish that i yeah i

3538.64 --> 3542.8799999999997
would have to

3539.52 --> 3545.119
literally trace the path of a signal

3542.88 --> 3547.599
one of these supposed satellite dish

3545.119 --> 3547.599
signals

3547.76 --> 3552.4
through the proposed setup with a drone

3550.079 --> 3555.6800000000003
and a signal receiver following it

3552.4 --> 3573.839
and then using gps to triangulate its

3555.68 --> 3573.839
exact trajectory towards the signal

3575.839 --> 3579.04
yeah the dishes points out well then you

3578.16 --> 3583.5989999999997
send your drown

3579.04 --> 3586.88
south this is about

3583.599 --> 3590.1600000000003
figuring out the pathway if it is

3586.88 --> 3593.76
straight or if it is slightly curved

3590.16 --> 3593.7599999999998
the pathway of the signal

3597.2 --> 3601.2799999999997
right thank you seeking star water

3599.68 --> 3603.359
appreciate it

3601.28 --> 3615.8390000000004
show's not over yet though still got

3603.359 --> 3615.839
half an hour more

3623.98 --> 3627.099
[Music]

3628.0 --> 3633.2
some dishes would point north what

3633.92 --> 3636.2400000000002
why

3641.119 --> 3646.0
and besides i thought that it was

3643.92 --> 3646.559
already you already claimed or some one

3646.0 --> 3649.76
of you

3646.559 --> 3653.119
already claimed that in the southern

3649.76 --> 3657.8390000000004
hemisphere in the south

3653.119 --> 3657.839
it points north to the equator so yeah

3662.96 --> 3671.839
it's getting uh your output is becoming

3665.2 --> 3671.839
a little bit contradicting now

3672.16 --> 3675.44
unless the towers were on the equator

3674.559 --> 3678.48
yeah

3675.44 --> 3680.4
there you go yeah

3678.48 --> 3683.52
i already said that that could literally

3680.4 --> 3699.839
be they could have built that

3683.52 --> 3699.839
quite a long time ago

3704.72 --> 3713.839
are you starting 8012 yeah i'm doing

3706.48 --> 3713.839
great today

3731.599 --> 3736.4
yeah emman look you're saying that

3734.72 --> 3738.24
and you're demanding that i freaking

3736.4 --> 3755.839
google that

3738.24 --> 3755.839
but i've never seen anything like that

3776.24 --> 3785.359
no i'm not going to look it up

3781.039 --> 3785.3590000000004
i just want some evidence this is your

3794.839 --> 3800.52
claim

3797.37 --> 3800.52
[Music]

3832.0 --> 3836.0
right most satellite dishes are at a

3834.079 --> 3837.119
degree angle yeah i keep telling them

3836.0 --> 3842.4
this

3837.119 --> 3846.0
but yeah mn insists that at the equator

3842.4 --> 3848.88
all set light tv dishes point up

3846.0 --> 3849.92
i've never heard about that before but i

3848.88 --> 3853.2000000000003
don't care to

3849.92 --> 3856.079
create that by looking that up

3853.2 --> 3857.2
no no i've literally just never heard

3856.079 --> 3859.92
about that before

3857.2 --> 3861.5989999999997
never seen that on photographs in

3859.92 --> 3864.64
equatorial regions

3861.599 --> 3867.039
like oh oh it's like oh look

3864.64 --> 3870.0789999999997
the satellite tv dishes are pointing up

3867.039 --> 3875.119
we must be close to the equator

3870.079 --> 3881.8390000000004
what no total horseshit

3875.119 --> 3881.839
total horseshit

3901.119 --> 3905.28
northwest right

3905.839 --> 3909.839
could be

3934.839 --> 3937.839
wow

3940.799 --> 3943.7599999999998
oh buxley

3946.4 --> 3951.839
oh don't you give them the their

3949.359 --> 3954.88
geometric horizon

3951.839 --> 3957.119
they don't have it it doesn't work out

3954.88 --> 3959.039
because they couldn't they can't measure

3957.119 --> 3962.0
it with terrestrial refraction

3959.039 --> 3962.0
that's a paradox

3962.319 --> 3965.92
so they don't have a geometric horizon

3964.88 --> 3968.4
anymore

3965.92 --> 3969.44
it's been well established now that the

3968.4 --> 3972.799
horizon

3969.44 --> 3980.64
as we see it even by their own admission

3972.799 --> 3980.64
is not geometric thereby negating

3980.72 --> 3984.5589999999997
the claim that the earth is a geometric

3983.44 --> 3986.48
globe

3984.559 --> 3987.599
and that the horizon could be a sphere

3986.48 --> 3989.44
edge because it's not

3987.599 --> 3992.7200000000003
and if they say terrestrial refraction

3989.44 --> 3993.68
that's self-contradicting they can't say

3992.72 --> 3996.799
that

3993.68 --> 3999.9199999999996
as a solution because it

3996.799 --> 4003.839
then disproves their original

3999.92 --> 4006.319
foundation of the assumption of r

4003.839 --> 4008.48
or could never be proven if there was

4006.319 --> 4012.16
such a thing as terrestrial refraction

4008.48 --> 4016.319
and terrestrial refraction requires r

4012.16 --> 4017.839
it's part of the formula so yeah

4016.319 --> 4020.24
just don't give them the geometric

4017.839 --> 4024.0
horizon anymore

4020.24 --> 4026.9599999999996
things aren't supposed to be blocked

4024.0 --> 4026.96
by the horizon

4028.4 --> 4032.96
because the horizon is not geometric

4030.319 --> 4037.359
it's not a physical obstacle in order to

4032.96 --> 4037.359
cover things up

4047.68 --> 4063.839
why what does it matter ambol

4079.81 --> 4083.56
[Music]

4089.38 --> 4094.96
[Music]

4091.599 --> 4105.839
all right well i'm over here europe

4094.96 --> 4105.839
and the netherlands

4118.319 --> 4124.2390000000005
it was near denmark it's denmark isn't

4121.6 --> 4127.1990000000005
too far away

4124.239 --> 4128.879999999999
like the netherlands is stuck to germany

4127.199 --> 4131.04
to the west

4128.88 --> 4133.839
and denmark is stuck to germany to the

4131.04 --> 4133.839
north

4144.38 --> 4147.409000000001
[Music]

4147.44 --> 4161.839
but then to the northwest netherlands

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4177.199 --> 4181.3189999999995
oh okay ambo yeah that was in amsterdam

4180.56 --> 4185.1990000000005
that was

4181.319 --> 4189.839000000001
2019 amsterdam conference

4185.199 --> 4189.839
i was there yeah

4194.719 --> 4202.8
i still remember being quite overwhelmed

4197.92 --> 4205.04
at that time

4202.8 --> 4206.96
man how the time has flown it's

4205.04 --> 4216.88
incredible

4206.96 --> 4220.08
it's almost a year later

4216.88 --> 4225.28
just two and a half months

4220.08 --> 4225.28
from now anyway

4228.84 --> 4231.84
uh

4242.84 --> 4245.84
is

4246.8 --> 4252.2390000000005
all right well holland earth passenger

4249.76 --> 4259.52
is technically

4252.239 --> 4263.919999999999
is a region of the netherlands

4259.52 --> 4263.92
it's a province two provinces

4268.56 --> 4273.4400000000005
but yeah in the it's like yeah you can

4271.92 --> 4276.96
call it holland it's like a

4273.44 --> 4276.96
colloquial way to say it

4278.159 --> 4285.44
for outsiders i don't know why but we

4282.719 --> 4287.679
just call it the netherlands in dutch

4285.44 --> 4287.678999999999
long

4293.199 --> 4301.839999999999
and why it's called dutch in english i

4296.159 --> 4301.839999999999
don't know that i don't know why that is

4308.88 --> 4314.56
although i do remember that from what i

4311.92 --> 4317.6
learned in history class

4314.56 --> 4320.159000000001
that before the netherlands like had its

4317.6 --> 4324.2390000000005
own official language and all that

4320.159 --> 4326.719
it was more of a blend

4324.239 --> 4328.32
with german apparently and they called

4326.719 --> 4331.44
that dietz

4328.32 --> 4334.48
it's like german dutch

4331.44 --> 4336.96
so i don't know maybe it's the dutch car

4334.48 --> 4340.0
is like originally taken from that in

4336.96 --> 4343.04
some way i don't know man

4340.0 --> 4344.239
i might have known this long time ago

4343.04 --> 4347.6
but i've forgotten

4344.239 --> 4349.759999999999
i can't i can't remember it if i ever

4347.6 --> 4349.76
knew

4350.48 --> 4354.4
it's an etymology where is it coming

4354.84 --> 4357.84
from

4369.44 --> 4375.199
they'll only draw back mainstream mocks

4373.44 --> 4385.839999999999
and ridicules them well but they do that

4375.199 --> 4385.839999999999
all the time anyway

4390.56 --> 4393.92
i don't know you know the mainstream

4392.239 --> 4396.718999999999
media it's like oh god

4393.92 --> 4398.719
the mainstream media mocks something

4396.719 --> 4403.52
that's usually

4398.719 --> 4403.52
going to peak interest of of new people

4403.6 --> 4407.4400000000005
you know there's this it's like this

4405.199 --> 4410.839999999999
weird effect it's kind of maybe

4407.44 --> 4413.599999999999
routed in oppositional defiance

4410.84 --> 4415.52
situations it's like okay the mainstream

4413.6 --> 4416.4800000000005
media is just always wrong so if the

4415.52 --> 4419.6
mainstream media

4416.48 --> 4421.759999999999
supports flat earth that would be

4419.6 --> 4424.2390000000005
terrifying

4421.76 --> 4426.2390000000005
but if they oppose it try to ridicule it

4424.239 --> 4429.28
and they're not doing a very good job

4426.239 --> 4430.48
being very backhanded like with politics

4429.28 --> 4432.96
and all that

4430.48 --> 4433.759999999999
then there's gonna be people that would

4432.96 --> 4436.159
before just

4433.76 --> 4438.719
out outright rejected they might

4436.159 --> 4441.839999999999
actually be like hmm

4438.719 --> 4441.84
that's odd

4442.48 --> 4445.678999999999
and they might consider having a peak

4445.36 --> 4447.5199999999995
that

4445.679 --> 4451.1990000000005
that's going to be the effect of is it's

4447.52 --> 4451.1990000000005
very weird how this all works

4452.84 --> 4455.84
effectively

4465.6 --> 4472.56
the globe earth conference what is there

4468.88 --> 4472.56
even such a thing earth passenger

4481.6 --> 4487.1990000000005
maybe space camp falls under globe earth

4484.56 --> 4487.1990000000005
conference

4488.56 --> 4497.84
or i don't know

4500.48 --> 4511.839999999999
it would be at least very close to it

4502.88 --> 4511.84
i'd imagine

4531.76 --> 4538.719
yes yes guns of nephron rnp

4535.12 --> 4542.239
it's media you know they con it's

4538.719 --> 4544.96
me media is a guild media is a secret

4542.239 --> 4545.36
guild compartmentalized with it on its

4544.96 --> 4548.4800000000005
own

4545.36 --> 4548.96
tricks and secret knowledge and [ __ ] so

4548.48 --> 4554.639999999999
it's like

4548.96 --> 4554.64
a guild now and nasa is part of that

4564.84 --> 4567.84
too

4586.719 --> 4598.2390000000005
you have to mow around it okay

4594.91 --> 4598.239
[Music]

4606.84 --> 4609.84
um

4610.08 --> 4614.32
it's weird a little stiff today i don't

4612.48 --> 4616.08
know why

4614.32 --> 4618.639999999999
didn't do anything out of the ordinary

4616.08 --> 4618.64
yesterday

4619.6 --> 4623.84
i don't know maybe it's just the weather

4621.12 --> 4623.84
again

4626.64 --> 4630.400000000001
yeah by the way beside that like the

4628.88 --> 4633.76
whole jaw situation

4630.4 --> 4636.799999999999
despite me drinking one cup of coffee in

4633.76 --> 4640.320000000001
the morning again for at least

4636.8 --> 4642.56
two weeks the job situation has just

4640.32 --> 4646.48
passed it's gone

4642.56 --> 4649.280000000001
i still have some cramp

4646.48 --> 4650.959999999999
muscle side effects a little that i now

4649.28 --> 4653.84
paid more attention to because

4650.96 --> 4654.159
it typically always happens and in a way

4653.84 --> 4656.2390000000005
to

4654.159 --> 4659.199
some extent i even kind of enjoy that

4656.239 --> 4661.678999999999
tension because that tension also

4659.199 --> 4663.678999999999
has a magnetizing effect locally it

4661.679 --> 4667.92
actually detracts

4663.679 --> 4670.4800000000005
local stress it's a mechanism

4667.92 --> 4671.12
right but if it cramps up it's it gets

4670.48 --> 4674.799999999999
all

4671.12 --> 4678.08
painful and then i can't earn

4674.8 --> 4680.88
tense it can stop it from cramping

4678.08 --> 4682.08
it's very annoying but yeah it's gone

4680.88 --> 4685.04
now

4682.08 --> 4687.36
the inflammation situation and doing

4685.04 --> 4687.36
great

4688.0 --> 4691.28
i feel very healthy

4691.6 --> 4696.159000000001
do i ever get a chance to travel to the

4693.76 --> 4699.12
us i don't know if i ever will i do have

4696.159 --> 4699.12
a passport though

4701.52 --> 4707.84
but at this time i i don't really see

4704.8 --> 4707.84
why i would do that

4714.48 --> 4721.839999999999
but who knows in the future

4735.76 --> 4738.96
guys have never owned rmp that's a good

4737.76 --> 4741.360000000001
one

4738.96 --> 4749.84
professor phil bells yeah he loves the

4741.36 --> 4749.839999999999
satellites oh yes he does

4756.239 --> 4760.08
that sounds great puxley

4760.84 --> 4766.56
but yeah the problem is also it's

4763.92 --> 4766.56
california

4767.28 --> 4777.84
weather may be good that's not the only

4770.0 --> 4777.84
thing you have to deal with over there

4786.4 --> 4792.0
great craft beers okay

4790.239 --> 4793.36
i don't know i really like the organic

4792.0 --> 4795.13
beer i'm getting here

4793.36 --> 4796.88
also there is this thing

4795.13 --> 4799.04
[Music]

4796.88 --> 4802.08
here in europe it's kind of different

4799.04 --> 4804.239
from the us and that is that

4802.08 --> 4806.639
i don't know there's much more a core

4804.239 --> 4809.839999999999
yeah a mindset

4806.639 --> 4812.32
with food that they're always paying

4809.84 --> 4815.52
attention like

4812.32 --> 4819.36
if there's issues with food it's gonna

4815.52 --> 4821.1990000000005
create a big problem every time

4819.36 --> 4824.159
so they're very careful with the food

4821.199 --> 4827.5199999999995
and no gmos allowed here

4824.159 --> 4830.32
the organic brand is much more reliable

4827.52 --> 4833.52
in my opinion here over in europe

4830.32 --> 4836.5599999999995
than it is in the united states

4833.52 --> 4840.159000000001
and yeah i'm kind of

4836.56 --> 4842.400000000001
near picky about my food

4840.159 --> 4844.638999999999
that's another reason why i'm not too

4842.4 --> 4846.638999999999
over enthusiastic to go to the us

4844.639 --> 4850.32
anytime soon

4846.639 --> 4854.2390000000005
unless i knew there was like a really

4850.32 --> 4856.159
reliable source of organic food

4854.239 --> 4861.839999999999
somewhere that i could rely on

4856.159 --> 4861.839999999999
for my entire stay

4862.8 --> 4865.84
and i wouldn't even mind like being part

4865.04 --> 4867.92
of

4865.84 --> 4869.12
work on that you know i've worked at a

4867.92 --> 4872.0
farm before

4869.12 --> 4875.28
it was young i really like that [ __ ]

4872.0 --> 4877.84
well not so much the [ __ ] part

4875.28 --> 4878.88
because that's usually in there as well

4877.84 --> 4881.28
but

4878.88 --> 4882.0
i don't mind the work and i really like

4881.28 --> 4886.4
being around

4882.0 --> 4888.08
the animals if there is any and i like

4886.4 --> 4890.239
dealing with plants especially i've

4888.08 --> 4894.639
become pretty good at

4890.239 --> 4898.0
dealing with plants so anyway

4894.639 --> 4901.36
i'm not gonna go anywhere for a while so

4898.0 --> 4904.719
so future future stuff maybe

4901.36 --> 4904.719
somewhere sometime

4912.32 --> 4916.5599999999995
all right well puxley i do forget that

4915.199 --> 4919.678999999999
sometimes that the u.s

4916.56 --> 4923.360000000001
is not all the city it's not all cities

4919.679 --> 4923.36
because the cities are pretty bad

4924.08 --> 4926.719
on average

4928.8 --> 4933.04
but yeah i guess that in the in the

4930.8 --> 4935.1990000000005
country

4933.04 --> 4936.639
especially yeah if there's farms

4935.199 --> 4939.759999999999
everywhere and they're really good and

4936.639 --> 4939.76
they're really updated

4940.239 --> 4945.199
with actual knowledge you're not media

4942.84 --> 4948.56
[ __ ]

4945.199 --> 4949.839999999999
yeah then yeah as owen benjamin says

4948.56 --> 4952.88
that's like

4949.84 --> 4956.2390000000005
then those regions in those places

4952.88 --> 4959.84
it's the best place to be ever

4956.239 --> 4959.839999999999
that's right

4964.8 --> 4968.8
all right well thanks for the offer good

4966.639 --> 4972.639
service i i know

4968.8 --> 4974.8
i might go on a tour maybe someday i

4972.639 --> 4977.12
don't know

4974.8 --> 4977.12
i'm

4977.84 --> 4981.92
i'm not too much of a traveler

4982.48 --> 4987.919999999999
it's like a big deal to me it

4985.6 --> 4990.719
will take a huge amount of getting used

4987.92 --> 4990.719
to huge

4990.96 --> 4997.84
like even with just like summer vacation

4995.04 --> 5000.08
with the family when i was younger just

4997.84 --> 5003.360000000001
moving away from home

5000.08 --> 5004.4
it's almost shocking to me but it did

5003.36 --> 5008.239
get used to it

5004.4 --> 5010.638999999999
and did find like the other modus

5008.239 --> 5011.919999999999
because we usually did go to the same

5010.639 --> 5015.12
place

5011.92 --> 5018.4
every time and i needed that

5015.12 --> 5020.48
because i'm not much of a traveler to me

5018.4 --> 5022.799999999999
getting to a new place is almost like

5020.48 --> 5024.4
entering hostile territory it seems like

5022.8 --> 5025.28
that sometimes it's like my senses

5024.4 --> 5028.799999999999
suddenly have to

5025.28 --> 5031.199
do all these things that i'm not

5028.8 --> 5032.159000000001
used to but it must i must be done

5031.199 --> 5035.199
otherwise

5032.159 --> 5037.839999999999
everything that i am and i do will not

5035.199 --> 5039.5199999999995
be able to function there

5037.84 --> 5043.84
does that make any sense well that's

5039.52 --> 5043.84
what it's like

5049.199 --> 5053.919999999999
that's right yeah well you know once you

5051.199 --> 5053.919999999999
get going

5054.08 --> 5071.44
then it can be great if you have the

5056.719 --> 5073.36
resources to keep on going

5071.44 --> 5075.28
as a flat earther the government would

5073.36 --> 5080.88
probably arrest what

5075.28 --> 5080.88
foreign holy [ __ ] dude

5083.52 --> 5087.6
how would it spy what

5093.36 --> 5099.199
or maybe like an agent of influence

5096.48 --> 5100.879999999999
because i might convert some us people

5099.199 --> 5103.04
to flat earth

5100.88 --> 5104.639
and then they won't believe in the space

5103.04 --> 5108.56
force anymore

5104.639 --> 5113.84
oh dear agents of influence

5108.56 --> 5113.84
out here

5118.18 --> 5121.919
[Music]

5136.4 --> 5143.44
what earth passenger what do you mean

5140.08 --> 5144.719
i'm afraid of heights not afraid of

5143.44 --> 5146.96
heights but of wits

5144.719 --> 5146.96
what

5148.0 --> 5156.159
are you saying americans are fat

5151.92 --> 5159.36
or is this a more earth related geometry

5156.159 --> 5159.36
joke that i'm not getting

5167.76 --> 5183.84
sorry if that's not what you meant

5184.719 --> 5189.199
yeah yeah so i've heard so i've seen

5192.8 --> 5197.52
but but just because they're fat doesn't

5195.04 --> 5199.28
mean they're bad you know

5197.52 --> 5200.56
i love that they're really fatty

5199.28 --> 5203.36
americans like

5200.56 --> 5205.4400000000005
with american flag t-shirts and trump

5203.36 --> 5211.839999999999
hats and [ __ ]

5205.44 --> 5211.839999999999
i love that [ __ ]

5219.199 --> 5225.839999999999
it's like strong good spirits you know

5226.639 --> 5230.719
although yeah i would be like a twig in

5228.56 --> 5232.639
there

5230.719 --> 5234.0
well i'm not a twig what am i saying i'm

5232.639 --> 5237.28
not skinny well

5234.0 --> 5241.12
maybe compared to americans i'm skinny

5237.28 --> 5241.12
come on guys i'm not that skinny

5241.6 --> 5244.96
especially since i started drinking beer

5243.76 --> 5247.6
and [ __ ]

5244.96 --> 5248.56
regularly well maybe it's not even that

5247.6 --> 5254.96
you know

5248.56 --> 5254.96
but um let me make myself presentable

5256.159 --> 5261.679
right so yes

5259.52 --> 5263.040000000001
yeah the t-shirt does kind of emphasize

5261.679 --> 5266.719
it extra

5263.04 --> 5269.5199999999995
i guess i am slightly skinny

5266.719 --> 5269.52
but i don't know

5270.159 --> 5276.32
the problem is is that yeah having a lot

5272.4 --> 5276.32
of weight does have its advantages

5278.48 --> 5284.718999999999
especially in a brawl now i'm not much

5281.679 --> 5284.719
of a brawler though

5285.92 --> 5290.8
i'd be more a guy that would just chant

5288.56 --> 5293.280000000001
certain things to

5290.8 --> 5294.4800000000005
i would be the bard basically using my

5293.28 --> 5297.679
voice to just

5294.48 --> 5299.678999999999
inspire [ __ ] and hit that right tone to

5297.679 --> 5301.84
basically send everybody into an

5299.679 --> 5309.28
ecstatic frenzy

5301.84 --> 5312.159000000001
well apprenty may be a big word for it

5309.28 --> 5314.8
bringing in dnd terminology here so

5312.159 --> 5314.799999999999
don't mind me

5316.08 --> 5322.32
but i do really like good spirited

5318.48 --> 5326.08
protests and [ __ ]

5322.32 --> 5328.48
but when it's like really important

5326.08 --> 5330.88
you know just general protesting because

5328.48 --> 5334.799999999999
you like protesting

5330.88 --> 5334.8
because it's something you do every day

5334.84 --> 5340.88
that's i don't know

5338.96 --> 5342.4800000000005
i'm not making any sense anyway i think

5340.88 --> 5346.2390000000005
i'm gonna round out the show

5342.48 --> 5347.759999999999
i've gone on long enough anyway thanks

5346.239 --> 5349.36
everyone for coming

5347.76 --> 5351.84
i hope you liked the show i thought it

5349.36 --> 5352.5599999999995
was pretty good a couple of silent bits

5351.84 --> 5354.639
but

5352.56 --> 5356.159000000001
it was still interesting lots of

5354.639 --> 5359.1990000000005
satellite back and forth

5356.159 --> 5362.08
today with the satellite believers and

5359.199 --> 5365.5199999999995
me pointing out how can you test the

5362.08 --> 5368.08
pathway of the satellite dish

5365.52 --> 5369.040000000001
signal to figure out what's really going

5368.08 --> 5371.679
on

5369.04 --> 5372.56
so yeah that was still interesting

5371.679 --> 5374.56
anyway

5372.56 --> 5376.639
if you like the show then please don't

5374.56 --> 5378.4800000000005
