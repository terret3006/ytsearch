breakfast yet but yeah I don't know I'm

253.21 --> 262.27
not too too hungry there's a lot of

257.53 --> 266.72999999999996
things going on a lot of raucous social

262.27 --> 266.72999999999996
wise and background and

268.56 --> 275.82
yeah that's making me less hungry than

270.81 --> 284.52
usual hello Adam ikan Lewis Ronan glass

275.82 --> 288.27
Shaw but yeah things have been kind of

284.52 --> 293.19
piling up the whole Patricia situation

288.27 --> 296.76
and I really just like I was really big

293.19 --> 300.3
fan of her and I really am getting the

296.76 --> 307.68
feeling more that that she's probably

300.3 --> 310.95
not coming back so that's a bummer and

307.68 --> 312.99
that continues to be a bummer especially

310.95 --> 317.4
since all the material is gone like I

312.99 --> 324.0
don't know I still have my merit videos

317.4 --> 325.919
though right yeah and Hagrid

324.0 --> 329.46
well-situated the like and a lot of

325.919 --> 332.13
others responding pretty extremely to

329.46 --> 335.63
the whole situation and losing their

332.13 --> 339.18
decency in the process now Hagrid wells

335.63 --> 345.27
seems to finally calm down and is at

339.18 --> 346.29
least trying to stop acting out and

345.27 --> 349.43
that's good

346.29 --> 349.43
I really appreciate that

350.5 --> 353.629
[Music]

356.419 --> 363.19899999999996
Wow yeah Adam yeah you've been going all

360.27 --> 363.19899999999996
day as well

366.75 --> 372.42
debates went up to very late yesterday

370.02 --> 377.94
and there were some other

372.42 --> 383.07
oh yeah dijo news / non Secretary's is

377.94 --> 384.84
done for they literally got into an ego

383.07 --> 386.18
money fighting thing and it got

384.84 --> 390.27
completely out of hand

386.18 --> 391.98
it was ridiculous probably a lot of you

390.27 --> 394.46
have already seen it it was posted

391.98 --> 394.46000000000004
everywhere

401.05 --> 407.5
and it just goes to show how freakin

404.16 --> 411.84000000000003
unreliable these people are if you if

407.5 --> 411.84
you're even on their side as it were

413.22 --> 418.28900000000004
that did yeah what soon

427.37 --> 433.949
Democrats named Quaker McCree that's it

431.699 --> 436.65000000000003
right that was what we're all stuck

433.949 --> 441.449
called and Quaker McCrae is perfect so

436.65 --> 445.46
that guy is just such an inside out

441.449 --> 447.35
world actor every [ __ ] he brings forth

445.46 --> 450.29999999999995
literally

447.35 --> 453.57000000000005
now he's just caught in doing that [ __ ]

450.3 --> 457.919
he recorded it while while the other guy

453.57 --> 462.419
asked specifically not to then while the

457.919 --> 464.58
other guy was named Kyle yeah that was a

462.419 --> 467.34
that was beyond the dick move he was

464.58 --> 469.32
basically just like changing an

467.34 --> 472.13899999999995
agreement which was kind of stupid and

469.32 --> 475.2
he should basically have approached that

472.139 --> 477.69
another way probably have in the past I

475.2 --> 479.4
don't know it's yeah that's what you get

477.69 --> 481.229
when you see a recording that's

479.4 --> 484.01
basically part of a much longer

481.229 --> 489.65
conversation over time that wasn't

484.01 --> 494.4
basically meant for in the open but yeah

489.65 --> 500.13
like Steve and like McCrae what the [ __ ]

494.4 --> 501.69
like that guy totally like Oh bringing

500.13 --> 503.52
his daughter and everything you know

501.69 --> 508.08
that's her money and you're stealing

503.52 --> 510.04999999999995
from me and it was kind of weird like I

508.08 --> 513.77
don't get why they just didn't say okay

510.05 --> 516.1800000000001
let's just settle all scores payout

513.77 --> 519.93
according to the agreement so far and

516.18 --> 522.39
then rearrange the agreement and and if

519.93 --> 524.459
you don't like it go away maybe they

522.39 --> 528.63
kind of did end up doing that it was

524.459 --> 532.0799999999999
kind of hard to keep track but that just

528.63 --> 535.08
went to such idiot levels I can't

532.08 --> 539.57
believe that they would do that this

535.08 --> 539.57
guy's are just unbelievable

539.77 --> 544.43
[Music]

541.15 --> 547.04
and and for McCreight to basically even

544.43 --> 548.9
put out that video my god talk about

547.04 --> 551.77
shooting yourself in the foot showing

548.9 --> 555.41
your own character it's just bizarre

551.77 --> 558.89
like from now on if he even attempts to

555.41 --> 561.89
go back on YouTube somehow how is he

558.89 --> 565.1
gonna justify what he did there

561.89 --> 567.47
after all the typical stances he takes

565.1 --> 571.7
towards flat earthers for example it's

567.47 --> 574.09
just pathetic so good luck with that and

571.7 --> 574.09
Craig

575.72 --> 578.919
[Music]

592.26 --> 597.87
yeah Oh hm I agree Kyle was kind of

595.65 --> 600.99
ripping off or at least he was trying to

597.87 --> 602.94
like completely retro actively change

600.99 --> 608.0
the agreement that's of course it yeah

602.94 --> 608.0
that's you can't do that

611.98 --> 620.11
but yeah my Craig didn't exactly respond

616.77 --> 621.64
wisely either and then putting it all

620.11 --> 622.92
out I can't believe you could be that

621.64 --> 626.17
stupid

622.92 --> 628.06
because yeah you may be showing some

626.17 --> 630.31
proof of the other guy but at the same

628.06 --> 633.6899999999999
time you completely show your open hand

630.31 --> 636.8389999999999
like how stupid can you be

633.69 --> 636.839
[Music]

641.99 --> 647.0790000000001
you know

644.26 --> 649.029
let's just for the sake of it say that I

647.079 --> 650.9799999999999
would have been macragge I would have

649.029 --> 654.18
not put that out public and I would have

650.98 --> 659.4300000000001
held it back and gents a fit for Court

654.18 --> 662.41
you know that's what I would have done

659.43 --> 664.149
but yeah I'm not him and I would never

662.41 --> 666.959
allow myself to get into a position

664.149 --> 666.959
where he's at

678.03 --> 683.28
right no no look ahead grid Wells it's

681.42 --> 686.01
not about not being allowed to say

683.28 --> 689.76
[ __ ] it's about whining that people

686.01 --> 692.52
are trainees constantly especially

689.76 --> 694.26
people that we know and we don't agree

692.52 --> 697.5
with that and that is just very

694.26 --> 705.06
insulting to do it's extremely unpolite

697.5 --> 707.69
and you have no direct proof there was

705.06 --> 711.0
any real direct proof other than just

707.69 --> 715.95
Patricia screwed saying crazy things and

711.0 --> 718.11
she definitely did that and I a if you'd

715.95 --> 721.47
paid attention and watch my show I

718.11 --> 725.51
explained in detail what I think is

721.47 --> 729.8100000000001
driving that you shouldn't see like oh

725.51 --> 733.05
she has been caught caught secretly

729.81 --> 736.9399999999999
saying that or she didn't realize it was

733.05 --> 739.1099999999999
recorded like the C no it's just

736.94 --> 741.96
uncontrollably just flipping out

739.11 --> 744.15
whatever's on your mind not really think

741.96 --> 748.44
about it too carefully that is what that

744.15 --> 751.92
is and everybody if they don't if they

748.44 --> 755.07
allow that goes to extremes is natural

751.92 --> 758.6999999999999
process it's not wise to do that it's a

755.07 --> 761.3100000000001
natural process that doesn't mean you

758.7 --> 763.5600000000001
know that's like a secret that is B odd

761.31 --> 769.1099999999999
it was all an act no you got to

763.56 --> 773.4499999999999
understand how people work so yeah

769.11 --> 773.45
moving on indeed

775.69 --> 784.97
that heckard well stop obsessing over

780.94 --> 786.6800000000001
features I'm serious dude you know

784.97 --> 789.44
there's some other people that have been

786.68 --> 791.3
doing that also for a long time and I

789.44 --> 796.2700000000001
call them out for being absolutely

791.3 --> 800.5999999999999
ridiculous because what that is it's

796.27 --> 803.24
trans obsession become obsessed it's

800.6 --> 804.83
directed like oh look at the shape is

803.24 --> 806.57
that correct is that it's there

804.83 --> 812.96
something like being hidden ins they are

806.57 --> 817.22
they keeping a secret hmm it's a form of

812.96 --> 818.89
obsessive paranoia basically and it's

817.22 --> 822.7900000000001
not healthy for you and it's very

818.89 --> 827.65
unhealthy for your social relations so I

822.79 --> 836.0899999999999
recommend it to cut it off at the root

827.65 --> 838.37
don't engage in that no I'm giving you

836.09 --> 841.5400000000001
personal advice for your own health dude

838.37 --> 847.67
and you have issues and you know it you

841.54 --> 850.24
confessed it to me don't be two-faced

847.67 --> 850.24
about this

860.01 --> 867.519
[Music]

862.92 --> 872.5889999999999
right yep I'd like I wonder if you

867.519 --> 875.649
realize okay that I have to transgender

872.589 --> 878.7900000000001
and one's an older transgender friends

875.649 --> 882.61
there were like really close friends and

878.79 --> 886.689
I expect them or at least one of them to

882.61 --> 889.74
be friends until we die okay and if you

886.689 --> 893.23
have a problem with me being friends or

889.74 --> 897.22
defending people that are out in the

893.23 --> 900.79
open transgender or that might even turn

897.22 --> 904.899
out to be then I don't want anything to

900.79 --> 908.379
do with you you know the trans agenda is

904.899 --> 911.29
bad like trying to force little kids

908.379 --> 914.98
mind control them to become transgender

911.29 --> 918.67
that's bad [ __ ] but what people do in

914.98 --> 920.98
their adult lives that's something else

918.67 --> 922.689
and it's not good if everybody is

920.98 --> 925.24
basically being brainwashed into

922.689 --> 928.75
becoming transgender because yeah then

925.24 --> 932.699
we everyone that engages in that can't

928.75 --> 935.819
procreate anymore and that's bad that

932.699 --> 939.699
doesn't mean that they're all in on it

935.819 --> 942.43
trying to exterminate mankind that is

939.699 --> 945.939
paranoid delusion there are definitely

942.43 --> 949.42
some out there that do okay not don't

945.939 --> 952.42
don't think that there aren't but that

949.42 --> 956.439
doesn't mean it's all of them you gotta

952.42 --> 962.319
take it case-by-case and they're

956.439 --> 964.649
definitely some really crazy supposedly

962.319 --> 968.5889999999999
trans or whatever

964.649 --> 970.259
Satanists out there absolutely but that

968.589 --> 973.48
doesn't mean that every single

970.259 --> 976.0790000000001
transgender person is a Satanist get

973.48 --> 976.0790000000001
real

976.829 --> 979.829
okay

982.25 --> 985.46
[Music]

997.57 --> 1000.779
all right

1005.53 --> 1021.1999999999999
so yeah let's see guess the tone is not

1013.52 --> 1029.6
really set well with this yeah look this

1021.2 --> 1034.88
is just this just how I am you know I am

1029.6 --> 1038.6
not having a war on transgender people

1034.88 --> 1041.21
or to me that would be almost like okay

1038.6 --> 1044.6599999999999
you're gonna get have a war on people

1041.21 --> 1050.27
that have piercings it doesn't make any

1044.66 --> 1055.9
damn sense to me and I've also outspoken

1050.27 --> 1061.8799999999999
it out like yeah I I don't encourage it

1055.9 --> 1064.0400000000002
I'm not yeah well I'm not gonna like

1061.88 --> 1066.8000000000002
puttin huge effort to stop somebody

1064.04 --> 1069.68
although I will basically question their

1066.8 --> 1074.57
motives to that yeah directly to them

1069.68 --> 1077.66
and I have I have so but it's their

1074.57 --> 1084.6799999999998
business all I can do is give a little

1077.66 --> 1089.03
input and yeah I don't I don't hate them

1084.68 --> 1090.68
for it's it's almost like a bit in a way

1089.03 --> 1093.05
there is like a moment of disappointment

1090.68 --> 1094.79
but you can't just start to hang on to

1093.05 --> 1096.53
that if people make these choices they

1094.79 --> 1100.76
make these choices what can you do

1096.53 --> 1104.3
really they're like yeah you can warn

1100.76 --> 1107.57
them like realize what could happen you

1104.3 --> 1110.3799999999999
might go through hormonal they'll know

1107.57 --> 1113.1799999999998
about a lot of it and still do it and

1110.38 --> 1115.67
sometimes they won't and you can help

1113.18 --> 1122.5600000000002
them remind them just discuss it if you

1115.67 --> 1122.5600000000002
really want to help them

1122.859 --> 1128.1789999999999
make the right decision or at least

1125.96 --> 1129.859
allow them to completely understand what

1128.179 --> 1136.1190000000001
they're engaging in on the long run that

1129.859 --> 1136.119
kind of thing and right

1139.55 --> 1148.43
you know still consider the freedom of

1143.72 --> 1150.65
choice and the natural law you can do to

1148.43 --> 1152.8400000000001
yourself whatever you want you can make

1150.65 --> 1159.14
as terrible mistakes as you want but

1152.84 --> 1162.22
it's only when you hurt others that when

1159.14 --> 1169.73
you endanger others when you hurt others

1162.22 --> 1171.29
by trying to push well let's just say

1169.73 --> 1173.39
it's something that could be considered

1171.29 --> 1175.99
a self-mutilation if you push that on

1173.39 --> 1178.6100000000001
others that could be considered damaging

1175.99 --> 1180.74
if you want to do it to yourself that's

1178.61 --> 1184.6399999999999
not so you gotta follow natural law

1180.74 --> 1188.66
don't harm others and you shouldn't harm

1184.64 --> 1191.3600000000001
yourself but yeah God allows us to make

1188.66 --> 1194.21
mistakes and if you want to make a

1191.36 --> 1196.1599999999999
really big mistake because you're

1194.21 --> 1200.18
obsessed or distracted or just

1196.16 --> 1203.63
delusional then God allows that mistake

1200.18 --> 1205.6100000000001
to be made but if you hurt others then

1203.63 --> 1207.6200000000001
there will be consequences that is how

1205.61 --> 1212.8
it works that's natural law that is

1207.62 --> 1212.8
natural that is the law but that's

1215.38 --> 1220.18
that's just sensible right guys

1235.58 --> 1242.6899999999998
and now there is an issue also about

1238.22 --> 1247.669
this like yeah what is even forcing

1242.69 --> 1251.48
others to to damage themselves right so

1247.669 --> 1253.489
let's just for the sake of it say that

1251.48 --> 1255.499
you have a real problem with veganism

1253.489 --> 1257.809
and there's a lot of people that do that

1255.499 --> 1260.6000000000001
I really just like don't like it they

1257.809 --> 1263.57
don't find it a smart way they argue

1260.6 --> 1267.1689999999999
like but you need like these other

1263.57 --> 1269.119
things you need them and that's like the

1267.169 --> 1272.929
thing is it's half half like yeah you

1269.119 --> 1274.85
you can use it it has downsides you can

1272.929 --> 1277.8790000000001
be vegan not have those downsides and

1274.85 --> 1280.399
have other downsides it's all a matter

1277.879 --> 1284.269
of what fits your metabolism the best

1280.399 --> 1286.309
naturally that is really in the end how

1284.269 --> 1289.34
people make their choices in their diets

1286.309 --> 1291.769
if they're wise unless they get obsessed

1289.34 --> 1293.899
but to say that all veganism could

1291.769 --> 1297.259
potentially if you say others have to be

1293.899 --> 1301.879
vegan now that could potentially be

1297.259 --> 1304.279
damaging you could basically yeah really

1301.879 --> 1308.539
push somebody an individual like you

1304.279 --> 1311.989
have to go vegan and like really push

1308.539 --> 1314.029
them into it like when they originally

1311.989 --> 1316.94
didn't want to not let them consider it

1314.029 --> 1320.629
but just push it now that's that's

1316.94 --> 1323.8990000000001
borderline assault sort of it's it's

1320.629 --> 1327.859
damaging it's it's risky but if you just

1323.899 --> 1331.4599999999998
say look I eat vegan look at my health I

1327.859 --> 1334.119
realize the issues with it but it works

1331.46 --> 1337.999
if I just get the right supplements and

1334.119 --> 1340.309
it's great I look better I let's tired

1337.999 --> 1344.45
all these issues and I don't have to

1340.309 --> 1347.4189999999999
feel guilty for the animals which I care

1344.45 --> 1352.19
about that's good and you're not pushing

1347.419 --> 1355.22
it you're just saying look this works

1352.19 --> 1360.019
you can try it too basically and that's

1355.22 --> 1362.929
not offensive even if somebody could be

1360.019 --> 1365.179
convinced that way to tried and it

1362.929 --> 1367.8200000000002
wouldn't be healthy for them now if that

1365.179 --> 1370.6000000000001
person then got obsessed with it

1367.82 --> 1373.129
they would endanger themselves but yeah

1370.6 --> 1375.379
that would be their obsession

1373.129 --> 1377.899
because if they wouldn't have that then

1375.379 --> 1380.09
they would just go vegan and see like oh

1377.899 --> 1384.0189999999998
it's not really working I maybe have to

1380.09 --> 1386.2289999999998
take a step back you know and then

1384.019 --> 1392.57
there's no problem

1386.229 --> 1400.099
so it's all it's really just about

1392.57 --> 1402.529
trying to enforce something and what is

1400.099 --> 1403.749
enforcement enforcement is not getting

1402.529 --> 1409.539
pissed off

1403.749 --> 1414.34
enforcement is not trying to let

1409.539 --> 1417.259
information sink into somebody and then

1414.34 --> 1417.9189999999999
demand proof that they actually got the

1417.259 --> 1420.32
message

1417.919 --> 1423.3790000000001
that's not enforcement what is

1420.32 --> 1430.519
enforcement is telling people you can't

1423.379 --> 1433.2199999999998
do this you must do that and that and in

1430.519 --> 1434.989
general so not even in the situation if

1433.22 --> 1437.029
you just start dictating in the

1434.989 --> 1439.69
situation like yet this is taking long

1437.029 --> 1442.849
enough you now have to do this and that

1439.69 --> 1445.3990000000001
or I like I kick you out that's

1442.849 --> 1447.4089999999999
something that is not the same and for

1445.399 --> 1450.83
what it's a general thing it's just like

1447.409 --> 1457.19
saying if you are like this then you're

1450.83 --> 1459.379
trash and yeah it's war or that is

1457.19 --> 1462.309
potentially offensive that is now

1459.379 --> 1467.4499999999998
offensive that that is borderline

1462.309 --> 1470.21
pushing it again but if you just speak

1467.45 --> 1473.95
out your opinion like yeah I think that

1470.21 --> 1477.609
these people are severely mistaken and I

1473.95 --> 1479.8990000000001
don't like dealing with people like that

1477.609 --> 1484.399
because that mistake is staring me in

1479.899 --> 1487.609
the face then it's not offensive then

1484.399 --> 1490.279
you're just speaking out your opinion so

1487.609 --> 1493.369
it's this is important this is important

1490.279 --> 1497.87
for everyone to realize how this works

1493.369 --> 1501.559
how we deal with the natural law of

1497.87 --> 1503.9899999999998
none effect like not and trying to

1501.559 --> 1506.48
enforce something damaging on somebody

1503.99 --> 1508.159
just using speech this is only about

1506.48 --> 1510.409
speech what I basically was explaining

1508.159 --> 1512.69
because in general it is much more

1510.409 --> 1520.029
straightforward don't don't assault

1512.69 --> 1520.029
anyone all that so yeah my little speech

1523.65 --> 1526.739
[Music]

1532.15 --> 1538.93
all right don't by the way I've yeah I

1538.93 --> 1544.39

talked about that definitely that a

1774.679 --> 1782.3600000000001
dedicated flattered early bird show if

1779.269 --> 1788.529
you look in the playlist you'll see it

1782.36 --> 1791.029
has a title with Patricia and it said

1788.529 --> 1793.72
yesterday or was it the day before that

1791.029 --> 1793.72
let me check

1811.11 --> 1813.4399999999998
right

1817.37 --> 1824.4799999999998
it's missing yeah it was 213 so it was

1821.37 --> 1828.889
not yesterday was the day before that

1824.48 --> 1832.919
apparently forgot to put it in the list

1828.889 --> 1836.9599999999998
hey thanks for the super chat donations

1832.919 --> 1836.96

I'm sorry for the delay guys and

1854.55 --> 1859.47
all right so stupid sometimes I put them

1857.7 --> 1863.01
in the playlist but they don't register

1859.47 --> 1866.64
I don't know why anyway it's in there

1863.01 --> 1871.01
now it's 213 why Patricia left YouTube

1866.64 --> 1871.01
so check it out five artists Levi Hollis

1882.38 --> 1896.4
all right Oh Billy was huh it's just a

1891.78 --> 1898.77
hard cutoff and I'm not even a hundred

1896.4 --> 1902.909
percent sure that teach that she really

1898.77 --> 1906.57
permanently deleted her YouTube maybe

1902.909 --> 1908.429
she just said it because she just

1906.57 --> 1912.03
doesn't want to have to deal with the

1908.429 --> 1915.3300000000002
backlash of all this and she might just

1912.03 --> 1920.1
restore it in a long time from now

1915.33 --> 1926.6689999999999
and but maybe probably not

1920.1 --> 1931.1999999999998
I just don't know all right thanks so

1926.669 --> 1932.73
Seth beam for the for the another three

1931.2 --> 1934.8300000000002
dollar super chat donation much

1932.73 --> 1937.46
appreciated I will definitely keep on

1934.83 --> 1937.46
doing what I do

1944.05 --> 1950.83
mmm all right I'll take care of your

1948.82 --> 1956.4099999999999
family five artists leave a God is

1950.83 --> 1960.4299999999998
always important you know not everybody

1956.41 --> 1963.01
has spare time to just keep on watching

1960.43 --> 1967.8100000000002
every freaking YouTube video that goes

1963.01 --> 1970.24
live every day like I do sort of which I

1967.81 --> 1972.25
do for kind of semi-professional reasons

1970.24 --> 1975.07
I want to keep really keep track and I

1972.25 --> 1981.03
enjoy it and I have the time so I'm kind

1975.07 --> 1989.1699999999998
of like he's spending it on that and

1981.03 --> 1991.72
following geopolitics as well I'm I'm

1989.17 --> 1995.26
mostly just really interested in the

1991.72 --> 1998.53
demeanors of world leaders what they're

1995.26 --> 2000.12
demeanors are it is fascinating I'm

1998.53 --> 2002.58
starting to see certain patterns I'm

2000.12 --> 2006.06
just wondering like how much do these

2002.58 --> 2008.4299999999998
images really coincide with their real

2006.06 --> 2012.75
character because you can see when it's

2008.43 --> 2015.0900000000001
off when it's a bluff and I find this

2012.75 --> 2016.8
very interesting to just look at so

2015.09 --> 2022.77
that's something that I also do on a

2016.8 --> 2025.6399999999999
daily basis and of course you have flat

2022.77 --> 2025.6399999999999
earth constantly

2026.89 --> 2030.6000000000001
or Benjamin

2044.99 --> 2056.73
okay let's just get through the list

2051.56 --> 2057.929
things that I've been watching oh yeah I

2056.73 --> 2062.45
almost forgot

2057.929 --> 2065.909
Nathan Thompson had like a live debate

2062.45 --> 2071.2799999999997
with a flat earther that was really good

2065.909 --> 2075.3
that was really impressive no wait no

2071.28 --> 2077.6690000000003
that's not the video I was thinking

2075.3 --> 2081.03
that's that it will also happen that was

2077.669 --> 2082.8889999999997
also good by the way but no I'm actually

2081.03 --> 2087.619
the thing that I was really impressed by

2082.889 --> 2091.2000000000003
was red pill philosophy he had a

2087.619 --> 2094.7400000000002
one-on-one debate with a with a yeah

2091.2 --> 2100.6189999999997
more typical baller and he was really

2094.74 --> 2102.93
good I was so impressed man I was there

2100.619 --> 2105.51
in his chat as well he's very he's very

2102.93 --> 2106.08
quick to respond to things super

2105.51 --> 2108.78
impressive

2106.08 --> 2110.97
so I also asked him like yeah you know

2108.78 --> 2113.84
contact me I want to get you on the show

2110.97 --> 2120.0899999999997
sometime just let's just start digging

2113.84 --> 2123.9900000000002
into the high level [ __ ] because he's

2120.09 --> 2125.31
absolutely capable of it I think we

2123.99 --> 2128.64
could have some really intense

2125.31 --> 2130.83
discussions so I'm hoping to see that

2128.64 --> 2137.15
maybe he'll come up with glow Buster's I

2130.83 --> 2140.75
mean the night owl show we'll see

2137.15 --> 2140.75
where's everybody gone

2144.83 --> 2149.17
that chat really slows down sometimes

2156.81 --> 2164.61
all right yeah yeah by the way a quart

2160.65 --> 2166.62
yeah that red red pill that was crazy he

2164.61 --> 2170.52
had so little viewers with such a

2166.62 --> 2173.91
massive channel it it really does seem

2170.52 --> 2177.21
like he's being cut off by YouTube I had

2173.91 --> 2181.29
no idea was that serious with with high

2177.21 --> 2184.95
subscriber flat earthers no idea like

2181.29 --> 2187.02
I'm barely even if I compare myself to

2184.95 --> 2188.9399999999996
red fill philosophy or example I am

2187.02 --> 2192.5099999999998
barely even touched by YouTube

2188.94 --> 2195.23
he's been demonetized his viewers are

2192.51 --> 2198.0600000000004
being cut off or at least apparently so

2195.23 --> 2204.27
can't really know if everybody is

2198.06 --> 2207.47
watching him live or not so that's bad I

2204.27 --> 2210.5099999999998
didn't know was that bad with him so I'm

2207.47 --> 2213.3799999999997
yeah I'm if I compare myself to that I'm

2210.51 --> 2223.34
my channel is barely influenced by you -

2213.38 --> 2227.67
I'm still monetized oh okay

2223.34 --> 2230.84
right well thanks for the two-pound

2227.67 --> 2233.52
super chat donation Billy was although

2230.84 --> 2238.61
not believing the Bible is the Word of

2233.52 --> 2241.13
God I I can't really agree to that

2238.61 --> 2243.69
because that's kind of contradict their

2241.13 --> 2247.2000000000003
contradictory I think that the Bible

2243.69 --> 2253.77
kind of is the Word of God but it's man

2247.2 --> 2256.1699999999996
that interprets it it too is on to their

2253.77 --> 2258.59
own ambition and design and that is the

2256.17 --> 2258.59
problem

2263.519 --> 2269.8289999999997
well thanks again for the two-pound

2266.619 --> 2271.9
super chat donation Billy was sure if

2269.829 --> 2277.469
you say so that it doesn't make you a

2271.9 --> 2277.469
blasphemer that that's up for debate

2293.57 --> 2302.09
right yeah the random explore concerning

2297.53 --> 2303.9500000000003
F okay thanks again Billy was a for the

2302.09 --> 2309.53
two parts of a chat donation just the

2303.95 --> 2311.21
critical thinker right well I have

2309.53 --> 2315.13
critical thought about it too I just

2311.21 --> 2315.13
expressed it if you didn't catch that

2315.7 --> 2325.8199999999997
then yeah you might have a blind spot

2318.83 --> 2328.46
there because I think I said that the

2325.82 --> 2333.34
Bible pretty much is an expression of

2328.46 --> 2335.96
the word of God it's just how men

2333.34 --> 2339.38
interpret it and leave things out and

2335.96 --> 2342.41
don't recognize basically the spirit of

2339.38 --> 2346.6400000000003
it like just like how the spirit of the

2342.41 --> 2350.5699999999997
law works and if you don't do that and

2346.64 --> 2355.97
if you delude a crowd with a certain

2350.57 --> 2359.42
interpretation then then you're doing it

2355.97 --> 2362.8399999999997
wrong because the Bible is is an

2359.42 --> 2364.87
individual reflection it's for the

2362.84 --> 2367.07
individual it's not supposed to be

2364.87 --> 2369.56
interpreted by an individual and then

2367.07 --> 2375.84
dictate it to a group of people as to

2369.56 --> 2379.0499999999997
how to interpret it in my opinion

2375.84 --> 2379.05
[Music]

2384.29 --> 2392.5299999999997
anyway right again getting back to

2388.88 --> 2395.12
random explore yeah

2392.53 --> 2397.2200000000003
reptile philosophy wasn't he talking

2395.12 --> 2399.14
about older content older videos how

2397.22 --> 2401.8399999999997
they disappear if you just link to it

2399.14 --> 2405.5299999999997
and I've experienced this myself look

2401.84 --> 2409.4900000000002
way back before flat earth I had like a

2405.53 --> 2412.1000000000004
forum on vampire freaks where I

2409.49 --> 2413.54
basically put down Infowars relating

2412.1 --> 2418.2799999999997
information which at that time was very

2413.54 --> 2422.57
good and I got a real crowd for it we

2418.28 --> 2424.13
were like the number was it yeah we at

2422.57 --> 2427.3700000000003
some point we're even like that at the

2424.13 --> 2430.01
number one political forum on that

2427.37 --> 2431.75
entire site which was pretty big but I

2430.01 --> 2435.38
put a lot of energy and effort into it

2431.75 --> 2437.42
but now if I go back to that almost

2435.38 --> 2441.44
every video that I'll link to is just

2437.42 --> 2444.2000000000003
gone and that's a general issue for the

2441.44 --> 2446.7200000000003
long run about YouTube if you want to

2444.2 --> 2449.06
properly source it for the long run and

2446.72 --> 2451.16
that's now becoming more apparent if you

2449.06 --> 2454.07
properly want to source something with

2451.16 --> 2458.42
videos then you gotta put it in your own

2454.07 --> 2461.0
separate source you got to keep a

2458.42 --> 2464.5
library of that stuff or it's just gonna

2461.0 --> 2468.52
be gone and that yeah that's true

2464.5 --> 2470.54
that's the issues with forums and

2468.52 --> 2473.3
sometimes yeah especially if you're

2470.54 --> 2475.25
gonna link with videos to individual

2473.3 --> 2479.44
youtubers that then suddenly get deleted

2475.25 --> 2484.67
by YouTube yeah then it all becomes

2479.44 --> 2488.14
disconcerted it's it's problematic but

2484.67 --> 2490.88
that's a more general problem I think

2488.14 --> 2494.2999999999997
it's like on the short run it's very

2490.88 --> 2496.79
easy to just drag relevant recent

2494.3 --> 2500.75
YouTube videos into an article to make a

2496.79 --> 2504.46
full read and video set up but that

2500.75 --> 2504.46
doesn't last very long

2504.6 --> 2510.04
after a few years there's a big chance

2507.31 --> 2512.44
it's all going to be gone or the videos

2510.04 --> 2516.34
are gonna be gone unless it separately

2512.44 --> 2520.56
uploaded specifically for that forum or

2516.34 --> 2520.56
website so

2529.39 --> 2537.5789999999997
right well the thing about it Billy was

2532.39 --> 2540.759
a is like the word of God yet that comes

2537.579 --> 2541.1800000000003
through people so it is an expression of

2540.759 --> 2545.559
it

2541.18 --> 2549.1299999999997
people got got that connection made the

2545.559 --> 2554.73
story and that's an expression of the

2549.13 --> 2560.38
word of God but the Word of God is

2554.73 --> 2563.529
interdimensional it is just so fast no

2560.38 --> 2565.9
human could properly translate it's not

2563.529 --> 2568.48
translatable to the physical world in

2565.9 --> 2572.529
that sense in my opinion because it's

2568.48 --> 2574.989
just another dimension but it can then

2572.529 --> 2582.609
express itself in the way that it has

2574.989 --> 2585.009
and still have that that origin within

2582.609 --> 2588.509
that we're woven within that story that

2585.009 --> 2588.509
frequency it's still there

2594.7 --> 2600.6299999999997
so in that sense yeah an expression of

2597.37 --> 2600.63
the word of God that's right

2612.36 --> 2619.04
all right Oh creator god it's whatever

2616.02 --> 2619.04
you want to call it

2623.19 --> 2632.31
you could call a deal the origin or the

2625.89 --> 2634.89
originator you know whatever you want in

2632.31 --> 2637.67
the Bible it's he's called while he's

2634.89 --> 2641.73
designated as a he and he's called God

2637.67 --> 2644.4300000000003
that's it so if you want to call it a

2641.73 --> 2647.63
creator get more technical about it sure

2644.43 --> 2647.6299999999997
you call it a creator

2663.36 --> 2669.17
hmm

2665.81 --> 2671.84
yeah yep

2669.17 --> 2674.7400000000002
while five artists Liebherr Alice yeah

2671.84 --> 2679.4300000000003
to fellow channel for a long time I see

2674.74 --> 2682.6099999999997
but yeah a video once a week that's not

2679.43 --> 2684.7999999999997
a guarantee like I followed the advice

2682.61 --> 2688.9
of Nathan he said look if you just have

2684.8 --> 2693.6200000000003
a daily show and you stay motivated

2688.9 --> 2695.96
it will grow that's inevitable

2693.62 --> 2698.24
so yeah since I started the early bird

2695.96 --> 2701.87
show it definitely did steadily great

2698.24 --> 2704.75
now it's not very fast get the feeling

2701.87 --> 2709.19
almost like I'm being cut out for that

2704.75 --> 2712.01
it was not good enough whatever but it

2709.19 --> 2714.38
is gradually growing because I do a show

2712.01 --> 2716.4100000000003
every day and I promise you if you're

2714.38 --> 2719.63
going to do a show every day and really

2716.41 --> 2723.43
stay into that oh yeah you are going to

2719.63 --> 2723.4300000000003
grow just as much maybe even more so

2727.09 --> 2731.01
daily show matters

2738.91 --> 2745.98
no no Billy was a neither Archer

2747.55 --> 2755.34
now it's man that uses the books for

2752.44 --> 2755.34
their control

2761.2 --> 2764.9399999999996
it's not the other way around

2776.4 --> 2784.0190000000002
oh okay mr. twenty-two Brian twenty-two

2781.529 --> 2815.67
yeah if you want to get on my panel then

2784.019 --> 2820.3799999999997
you gotta add me on skype so yeah add me

2815.67 --> 2823.17
on skype and yeah we can talk maybe if

2820.38 --> 2824.849
if you if you're gonna be in time and

2823.17 --> 2827.13
otherwise I'll try to add you for

2824.849 --> 2829.1400000000003
another time if you want to get it on

2827.13 --> 2831.71
with me on my show then it's gonna have

2829.14 --> 2831.71
to be Skype

2851.96 --> 2859.48
[Music]

2855.36 --> 2862.27
well Billy was a please drop it and

2859.48 --> 2866.47
bring your freaking atheism somewhere

2862.27 --> 2867.46
else or creator anti-biblical anti

2866.47 --> 2870.39
writing [ __ ]

2867.46 --> 2873.39
please I've done with this discussion

2870.39 --> 2873.39
okay

2875.75 --> 2878.949
[Music]

2890.84 --> 2895.88
if you can't get on my level about this

2893.36 --> 2898.75
then I'm not gonna continue this

2895.88 --> 2898.75
discussion with you

2902.84 --> 2905.8990000000003
[Music]

2907.07 --> 2911.44
yes yes you do mr. rain

2943.07 --> 2954.3500000000004
now don't don't involve yourself Daniel

2946.99 --> 2961.16
in this you you have no foundation even

2954.35 --> 2963.68
to engage in such a conversation no he

2961.16 --> 2966.14
does not regard the Bible a bit

2963.68 --> 2968.54
differently he's basically outright

2966.14 --> 2973.85
denying it has anything to do with God

2968.54 --> 2974.71
that's what he's doing and that's just

2973.85 --> 2980.0899999999997
ridiculous

2974.71 --> 2982.4
if you if you have that opinion then you

2980.09 --> 2985.46
haven't read it you haven't you haven't

2982.4 --> 2987.35
actually opened up to what is going on

2985.46 --> 2993.02
there it's not just a straightforward

2987.35 --> 2996.56
book I've experienced it myself there's

2993.02 --> 2999.31
so much more to the Bible than just a

2996.56 --> 2999.31
freaking story

3001.42 --> 3004.5190000000002
[Music]

3010.81 --> 3013.869
[Music]

3025.95 --> 3046.5
all right

3028.22 --> 3048.9599999999996
Dulli grief letter Smurf I've been

3046.5 --> 3051.99
talking uh I've been going more in-depth

3048.96 --> 3054.39
than discussion about that but I don't

3051.99 --> 3058.9199999999996
know to just talk about Flat Earth again

3054.39 --> 3064.1
on my own right now I don't know love to

3058.92 --> 3066.6
go into discussion with somebody and

3064.1 --> 3068.04
also yeah there's not gonna be any Flat

3066.6 --> 3071.13
Earth debates after this because it's

3068.04 --> 3073.44
Saturday of course so technically we can

3071.13 --> 3075.6
go on but if it's just gonna be me

3073.44 --> 3079.53
talking I'm probably gonna get hungry at

3075.6 --> 3081.12
some point and just stop the show so

3079.53 --> 3084.0600000000004
unless somebody actually wants to come

3081.12 --> 3087.23
on with me on the panel it's not gonna

3084.06 --> 3087.23
be a super long show

3093.4 --> 3100.2400000000002
thank you five artists labor Alice uh

3096.42 --> 3101.4700000000003
I'm okay at it I've had a lot of

3100.24 --> 3105.31
practice it's not like I'm having

3101.47 --> 3109.9199999999996
panelists every day it's really 5050 if

3105.31 --> 3112.87
if not less and I'm used to it

3109.92 --> 3115.0
and I think I'm moderating my chat

3112.87 --> 3118.5899999999997
pretty decently and resulting in people

3115.0 --> 3121.57
well having these in conversations and

3118.59 --> 3124.57
yeah I get plenty to work with

3121.57 --> 3126.82
and I get plenty of practice the only

3124.57 --> 3131.73
real problem for me so far is that

3126.82 --> 3134.44
sometimes I like really lose track of of

3131.73 --> 3137.08
subjects and I start to basically grow

3134.44 --> 3140.02
silent and stare at the chat in order to

3137.08 --> 3142.36
try to find some subject that's kind of

3140.02 --> 3145.21
annoying the silences are never really

3142.36 --> 3147.3700000000003
good and when I have plenty of energy

3145.21 --> 3149.5
that doesn't happen I just keep on

3147.37 --> 3153.73
rolling and rolling and look forward as

3149.5 --> 3155.77
I am saying things to what I'm going to

3153.73 --> 3157.33
be saying after that and then works

3155.77 --> 3166.09
perfectly but that doesn't always happen

3157.33 --> 3168.99
every day yeah last couple of days have

3166.09 --> 3168.9900000000002
been a bit tiring

3172.4 --> 3186.54
hey mr. brine look either you add me on

3177.75 --> 3190.77
skype or you don't just I already said

3186.54 --> 3193.98
if I got panelists then I could keep on

3190.77 --> 3197.27
going otherwise yeah I'm not gonna keep

3193.98 --> 3197.27
on going so it's up to you

3206.19 --> 3217.2000000000003
no no Daniel I doubt it is Oh

3212.21 --> 3220.17
angle-of-attack test I just know if you

3217.2 --> 3223.3799999999997
look over flat surfaces of close

3220.17 --> 3226.77
proximity to those surfaces natural

3223.38 --> 3230.4
concealment will start to come into

3226.77 --> 3231.99
being as a phenomena things the flat

3230.4 --> 3235.02
surface in the foreground is gonna

3231.99 --> 3238.8799999999997
conceal the flat surface in the

3235.02 --> 3241.5
background and that's a natural effect

3238.88 --> 3244.23
it's a part of optics that is what I'm

3241.5 --> 3247.01
going by I'm not even gonna I know

3244.23 --> 3252.03
everybody else does it I used to do it

3247.01 --> 3254.19
but the wide variety of optics effects

3252.03 --> 3256.92
if you separate them are just so fast

3254.19 --> 3260.43
and complex and everything put together

3256.92 --> 3263.819
I still even have my doubts that we do

3260.43 --> 3266.97
have the complete picture of everything

3263.819 --> 3269.579
that is potentially involved in this so

3266.97 --> 3271.95
I'm just gonna go by my observation by

3269.579 --> 3274.319
basic logic and say look if you're

3271.95 --> 3276.89
looking over a flat surface with close

3274.319 --> 3281.0099999999998
in close proximity to that flat surface

3276.89 --> 3285.93
there will be natural concealment always

3281.01 --> 3289.7990000000004
it's like a natural law of optics so

3285.93 --> 3294.12
taking that into account you just

3289.799 --> 3297.17
conclude it's always there that's it

3294.12 --> 3297.17
[Music]

3305.16 --> 3316.859
no that's really nice it's funny though

3311.039 --> 3322.1090000000004
that that's one of those angles he did

3316.859 --> 3326.7889999999998
right so it does happen and look who

3322.109 --> 3330.15
know the thing is it's much easier to

3326.789 --> 3333.5690000000004
change the view angle or camera angle if

3330.15 --> 3336.69
something is relatively close by because

3333.569 --> 3339.24
you're not zooming in as much if you're

3336.69 --> 3343.289
like really looking super fast then that

3339.24 --> 3347.519
zoom also narrows down the angle the

3343.289 --> 3353.0890000000004
camera can take you can zoom in on a

3347.519 --> 3357.569
side part of the view so that's an issue

3353.089 --> 3360.3289999999997
so yeah it if it'll work when you just

3357.569 --> 3365.92
look straight over the flat surface then

3360.329 --> 3368.3900000000003
it works yeah

3365.92 --> 3373.799
[Applause]

3368.39 --> 3376.5
just stupid troll later just know either

3373.799 --> 3378.529
you come on or you don't stop wasting my

3376.5 --> 3378.529
time

3395.22 --> 3401.5299999999997
angles over the floor that's really nice

3398.43 --> 3406.839
but yeah I'm pretty sure of my case cuz

3401.53 --> 3410.099
I look again I've said it go to a very

3406.839 --> 3413.98
tall straight high-rise building

3410.099 --> 3417.9100000000003
put your hat next to it and then look

3413.98 --> 3420.13
straight past it upwards you'll see if

3417.91 --> 3424.0589999999997
it is really big if it's really tall a

3420.13 --> 3427.15
couple of hundred meters then yeah

3424.059 --> 3430.21
there's a big chance that some of that

3427.15 --> 3432.64
flat surface relatively closer to you

3430.21 --> 3439.119
then the top is going to be concealing

3432.64 --> 3443.799
the top and I tested this the best way

3439.119 --> 3447.52
would be to use one I put it right next

3443.799 --> 3450.39
to that close the other one because it's

3447.52 --> 3450.39
going to be further off

3457.27 --> 3463.78
and hey if you're like looking past for

3460.57 --> 3467.1600000000003
example a big flat a beam for example

3463.78 --> 3471.8500000000004
like huge steel beam that's

3467.16 --> 3473.6189999999997
geometrically flat and you can if

3471.85 --> 3476.92
there's like a cut-off point then you

3473.619 --> 3478.6600000000003
look just over it and passed it and if

3476.92 --> 3484.75
it's long enough you will see the same

3478.66 --> 3487.5099999999998
effect I've already done this like what

3484.75 --> 3493.09
I just described that's something that I

3487.51 --> 3498.88
figured out in 2000 okay I was already

3493.09 --> 3502.03
aware of that it just never really found

3498.88 --> 3504.79
a proper place to sink in my knowledge

3502.03 --> 3507.2400000000002
base it's just a trick I discovered and

3504.79 --> 3509.92
I kind of forgot about it again

3507.24 --> 3512.35
but I do remember it now again that I

3509.92 --> 3516.09
did definitely do that and figure that

3512.35 --> 3516.0899999999997
out back then

3525.369 --> 3529.9300000000003
right well that's really nice if you

3527.95 --> 3531.819
just want to outright deny everything

3529.93 --> 3533.019
that I just said that's really cool

3531.819 --> 3535.979
don't test it out

3533.019 --> 3539.1699999999996
don't test out what I just described

3535.979 --> 3541.089
because it doesn't happen it just

3539.17 --> 3541.92
doesn't no because see woman doesn't

3541.089 --> 3546.339
exist

3541.92 --> 3549.039
it's only curvature and if something

3546.339 --> 3550.749
wild does happen to conceal when you

3549.039 --> 3551.44
look past something well that's just a

3550.749 --> 3556.2099999999996
mistake

3551.44 --> 3559.39
that's just jerk right no no it doesn't

3556.21 --> 3562.42
conceal ever just only the curvature at

3559.39 --> 3569.759
the horizon that's that's the

3562.42 --> 3569.759
obstruction mm-hmm well fish guy

3574.23 --> 3581.4900000000002
I don't refuse to look at any footage

3578.69 --> 3586.68
you haven't actually presented any link

3581.49 --> 3588.5
or anything so and I'm just talking here

3586.68 --> 3591.06
I'm having a show and I'm just talking

3588.5 --> 3593.609
so stop being a dick

3591.06 --> 3595.97
in chat stop being annoying like that

3593.609 --> 3595.97
please

3603.91 --> 3606.839
I see

3607.109 --> 3609.799
let's see

3623.87 --> 3628.45
trouble even finding Jose's Channel all

3626.18 --> 3628.45
right

3635.18 --> 3638.39
[Music]

3642.57 --> 3648.0
okay so where's this supposed to proof

3645.28 --> 3648.0
on his channel

3654.68 --> 3656.71
I

3657.18 --> 3663.18
can you be more specific I just see open

3661.2 --> 3668.269
discussion earth discussion open

3663.18 --> 3668.269
discussion and open panel open that yeah

3669.109 --> 3677.339
so can you be a little bit more specific

3672.769 --> 3680.339
about this suppose it proved that Jose

3677.339 --> 3685.13
brought forth because you haven't been

3680.339 --> 3685.13
any anything close to specific so far

3711.29 --> 3720.05
two sec guys

3714.609 --> 3728.48
there's no two sec guys in any of the

3720.05 --> 3731.75
titles of Jose's video so now wait you

3728.48 --> 3734.26
mean two seconds spelled with a k that

3731.75 --> 3734.26
she's brilliant

3736.63 --> 3741.4900000000002
yeah Billy was that don't tell me what

3739.19 --> 3741.4900000000002
to do

3746.51 --> 3751.7000000000003
February 3 Jesus

3760.37 --> 3765.87
yep that's exactly the period when we

3763.35 --> 3771.95
were doing that kind of stuff and a flat

3765.87 --> 3771.95
earth debates as well for [ __ ] sake

3792.12 --> 3800.4
four months ago okay eight minutes and

3796.05 --> 3804.9500000000003
thirty seconds all right

3800.4 --> 3810.33
yeah the warehouse how funny was that Oh

3804.95 --> 3812.8799999999997
remember thanks for that yeah I remember

3810.33 --> 3815.58
now yeah Jose was actually the one that

3812.88 --> 3817.9500000000003
showed that over a flat surface light

3815.58 --> 3821.39
would be concealed over a distance how

3817.95 --> 3832.23
funny is that you guys are just

3821.39 --> 3834.39
unbelievable Jesus seriously the whole

3832.23 --> 3837.12
thing yet the whole thing the whole

3834.39 --> 3842.0899999999997
thing the whole point about the freakin

3837.12 --> 3845.45
video is that the light is concealed

3842.09 --> 3848.3900000000003
this is so stupid

3845.45 --> 3851.91
that what's the whole point

3848.39 --> 3854.67
remember what I told you for a test I'm

3851.91 --> 3856.56
watching the freakin video you told me

3854.67 --> 3859.98
right it's right there in the

3856.56 --> 3862.74
description box Daniel I know this video

3859.98 --> 3867.33
I was there when he presented it your

3862.74 --> 3870.33
hope I'm done with you dude I'm done

3867.33 --> 3873.45
with you this is so [ __ ] I'm so

3870.33 --> 3876.48
pissed off at you right now I can't

3873.45 --> 3878.7799999999997
believe you're that freaking out of your

3876.48 --> 3878.78
mind

3887.43 --> 3895.87
now Daniel had it coming for a long time

3890.97 --> 3898.45
like he keeps on doing this [ __ ] his

3895.87 --> 3902.38
cognitive dissonance is just so painful

3898.45 --> 3905.23
it's like he wants to be tortured with

3902.38 --> 3907.81
the freaking truth that he just he goes

3905.23 --> 3909.7
everywhere takes everything and then

3907.81 --> 3912.79
doesn't see the truth about it and

3909.7 --> 3915.7599999999998
breaks in with this freaking delusion

3912.79 --> 3918.79
that then forms what it supposedly is

3915.76 --> 3924.0
and it's wrong it's so incredibly wrong

3918.79 --> 3924.0
it's just painful it's painful

3937.0 --> 3940.119
[Music]

3952.26 --> 3955.949
[Music]

3960.61 --> 3963.6690000000003
[Music]

3969.25 --> 3973.44
I was wondering when you were going to

3970.99 --> 3973.4399999999996
show up

3985.46 --> 3990.95
yeah Billy was out what Daniel was

3987.71 --> 3994.13
saying oh look at this video of Jose

3990.95 --> 3998.089
we're concealment didn't happen because

3994.13 --> 4000.73
of the angles of the camera and then

3998.089 --> 4003.069
literally gave me a title that I watched

4000.73 --> 4008.89
I posted hit here in the chat if you

4003.069 --> 4011.29
look carefully and I was there live when

4008.89 --> 4017.0499999999997
he presented it on the flat earth

4011.29 --> 4019.0589999999997
debates and he proved concealment so

4017.05 --> 4023.7400000000002
Daniel is just being a cognitive

4019.059 --> 4028.21
dissonance freaking idiot and I can't

4023.74 --> 4030.6699999999996
tolerate this [ __ ] any longer I can't

4028.21 --> 4032.89
tolerate it bothers would get that

4030.67 --> 4037.2400000000002
stupid that they would literally point

4032.89 --> 4039.73
me at a very distinct proof of something

4037.24 --> 4042.49
video and then say that it disproves

4039.73 --> 4047.26
that I'm so sick of that freaking

4042.49 --> 4051.0989999999997
cognitive dissonance [ __ ] get out of

4047.26 --> 4053.98
here with that just piss off take your

4051.099 --> 4057.119
delusion somewhere else go make a

4053.98 --> 4057.119
painting or something

4062.42 --> 4065.6800000000003
hello Jose

4070.03 --> 4079.7000000000003
I'm sick of it Billy I just I don't want

4076.28 --> 4080.3900000000003
to be repeating the same [ __ ] over and

4079.7 --> 4082.85
over again

4080.39 --> 4086.23
I refuse to deal with people that are

4082.85 --> 4091.0699999999997
intellectually on the level of animals

4086.23 --> 4092.9
that just freakin drone the same [ __ ] on

4091.07 --> 4095.259
like a freakin parrots and don't have

4092.9 --> 4098.509
the clue what the hell they're doing

4095.259 --> 4100.88
keep on just following the mechanisms

4098.509 --> 4103.13
that wasn't green in them and they

4100.88 --> 4108.47
totally lose track of reality and I'm

4103.13 --> 4112.13
just sick of it I'm trying to basically

4108.47 --> 4116.049
help educate some people like Daniel but

4112.13 --> 4118.52
he's only he's only gotten worse I

4116.049 --> 4120.47
thought we were getting into some kind

4118.52 --> 4124.370000000001
of understanding about presuppositional

4120.47 --> 4127.96
things how that works and everything and

4124.37 --> 4131.75
he just drops back just switches back

4127.96 --> 4134.42
it's like they learn something they go

4131.75 --> 4135.109
to sleep they wake up like nothing ever

4134.42 --> 4139.25
happened

4135.109 --> 4141.89
back to the old program and well we know

4139.25 --> 4144.83
Brenda for example does this continually

4141.89 --> 4146.81
it's like very apparent neurotic at it

4144.83 --> 4148.58
and there's some other ballers as

4146.81 --> 4150.29
obvious also have that but I thought

4148.58 --> 4154.24
that Daniel was kind of different

4150.29 --> 4154.24
I thought he was just a really dedicated

4154.63 --> 4163.31
nerd to this and he's very knowledgeable

4159.19 --> 4167.21
but he's also very vulnerable to

4163.31 --> 4170.330000000001
cognitive dissonance but doesn't have

4167.21 --> 4173.35
the skill to deal with it and that's

4170.33 --> 4173.35
just disappointing

4191.739 --> 4201.389999999999
okay dad no

4194.79 --> 4214.94
I'll do it gonna do what you say and if

4201.39 --> 4214.9400000000005
this turns out to be [ __ ] your band 650

4219.699 --> 4228.33
right oh my tangling it upward I get it

4225.33 --> 4228.33
right

4238.139 --> 4244.679
all right yeah oh the thing is if you

4241.59 --> 4249.09
angle your camera upwards then the

4244.679 --> 4254.34
actual center point which is basically

4249.09 --> 4256.71
the height of the lens heightens so

4254.34 --> 4259.71
practically comes down to moving

4256.71 --> 4261.75
slightly up and as we all know consumers

4259.71 --> 4264.389
rate is extremely dependent on the

4261.75 --> 4267.0
height of the observer so if you tilt

4264.389 --> 4271.02
your camera upwards it's going to be

4267.0 --> 4272.58
effectively heightened but the same

4271.02 --> 4274.17
thing would happen if you point the

4272.58 --> 4276.619
camera straight and just put it up a

4274.17 --> 4276.619
little higher

4281.7 --> 4285.23
puts it down again

4293.219 --> 4296.0
okay

4304.91 --> 4315.5599999999995
sorry I I don't see the issue here

4308.93 --> 4317.450000000001
really and if I had to size it up that

4315.56 --> 4328.6
total distance is not even that far

4317.45 --> 4328.599999999999
really what is that like 20 meters

4344.1 --> 4353.04
right so yeah I I don't see it

4349.88 --> 4356.24
you keep on saying it right but it's

4353.04 --> 4356.24
still the same distance

4357.2 --> 4361.55
now it's walking to that [ __ ]

4365.73 --> 4368.33
right

4376.129 --> 4382.969
all right well I don't get your point

4379.219 --> 4384.439
really parallel to the surface no I'm

4382.969 --> 4386.2390000000005
pretty sure he pointed it upwards

4384.439 --> 4389.119000000001
because when he was holding it it was

4386.239 --> 4391.188999999999
what looking straight forward and even

4389.119 --> 4394.869
the thing was in the down corner of the

4391.189 --> 4394.869000000001
screen so

4404.719 --> 4411.8
hmm now that I'm actually looking again

4408.86 --> 4413.57
really carefully I do see that some of

4411.8 --> 4416.900000000001
the light is concealed just not all of

4413.57 --> 4422.66
it cuz that lamp that entire thing and

4416.9 --> 4425.389999999999
the end when he shows it it is like yeah

4422.66 --> 4427.19
it's like 10 centimeters wide

4425.39 --> 4430.01
the entire thing so it's pretty big

4427.19 --> 4433.91
light it's not like a little mobile

4430.01 --> 4440.4800000000005
phone light which is maybe one or two

4433.91 --> 4443.32
centimeter across yeah why don't I

4440.48 --> 4446.2699999999995
screen share look it's not my video I

4443.32 --> 4451.179999999999
already posted it just take a look for

4446.27 --> 4451.18
it take a little look at it for yourself

4451.9 --> 4458.0599999999995
the thing is I just don't even want to

4454.43 --> 4460.4490000000005
spend all this time on the ship Daniel

4458.06 --> 4460.4490000000005
is just

4466.13 --> 4475.389
that still still consumer is happening

4469.19 --> 4475.388999999999
so I just don't see the point here

4476.65 --> 4481.78
fine fine I'll show it

4489.33 --> 4492.33
what

4516.76 --> 4522.09
all right so

4528.239 --> 4534.53
there you go it's just that 2 minute 46

4535.489 --> 4539.929999999999
it's obviously not that far away

4549.849 --> 4565.21
but right here yeah it did so obviously

4558.31 --> 4569.29
as Jose is moving closer and closer it

4565.21 --> 4574.9
doesn't work anymore did I isn't it

4569.29 --> 4577.2699999999995
obvious it is due to the proximity look

4574.9 --> 4580.69
the closer you get the closer the

4577.27 --> 4583.2390000000005
observer needs to the center point of

4580.69 --> 4587.049999999999
the lens of the observer needs to be to

4583.239 --> 4599.25
the surface or yeah it's gonna consume

4587.05 --> 4599.25
much less so this over here

4604.22 --> 4614.18
it's wait a minute

4609.04 --> 4616.5199999999995
that's weird you know I'm starting to

4614.18 --> 4618.35
wonder how even this floor is here

4616.52 --> 4622.450000000001
because I don't know when I look at it

4618.35 --> 4625.79
there seems to be a halfway a little

4622.45 --> 4627.86
concealment of the floor itself but then

4625.79 --> 4631.16
afterwards it seems to be almost going

4627.86 --> 4635.54
up in another layer it's that's what I

4631.16 --> 4640.22
just saw so maybe Lucy this does that

4635.54 --> 4642.2
see me even it's like a little I don't

4640.22 --> 4644.72
know maybe this floor isn't actually

4642.2 --> 4649.28
completely even just look at the side of

4644.72 --> 4651.47
this it's kind of wobbly so maybe this

4649.28 --> 4655.509999999999
floor is actually not perfectly even

4651.47 --> 4663.59
this is yeah this is like a warehouse

4655.51 --> 4665.75
set up an older thing storage not really

4663.59 --> 4668.06
an active robotic perfect warehouse or

4665.75 --> 4671.03
anything so I think maybe that's an

4668.06 --> 4676.67
explanation as to why you see this

4671.03 --> 4678.7699999999995
little like it's a little upward at the

4676.67 --> 4681.16
end weird I don't know I don't know what

4678.77 --> 4681.160000000001
this is

4688.059 --> 4694.820000000001
you guys see it as well just look at the

4692.03 --> 4700.179
the lighting and the shadow on the

4694.82 --> 4703.808999999999
floors and how they get concealed see

4700.179 --> 4703.809
just fold in

4710.959 --> 4713.739
right

4718.079 --> 4723.86
okay so that was that I showed it done

4727.13 --> 4736.05
Hey

4729.079 --> 4739.369

5027.6 --> 5032.1900000000005
finally calling again I almost have to

5030.63 --> 5034.47
say that we would have to have our own

5032.19 --> 5038.419999999999
kind of notification system outside of

5034.47 --> 5040.26
YouTube that's not really reasonable

you're coming through clear yeah ok ok

5056.07 --> 5062.37
let me know if it gets hot sure I will

5058.68 --> 5068.34
so hey yeah welcome to the show what

5062.37 --> 5070.83
bring mine here it's like to get on me a

5068.34 --> 5072.12
few times before there I just want some

5070.83 --> 5076.44
possibility was still many people in

5072.12 --> 5079.26
doubt the reason I flat out just in case

5076.44 --> 5081.78
of one on the reason I mention is that

5079.26 --> 5084.3
resistance the Jose JG comes out as a

5081.78 --> 5089.48
show I think it was yesterday or the day

5084.3 --> 5093.45
before and your friends horse chemo and

5089.48 --> 5095.49
a few others were on the show when I say

5093.45 --> 5098.429999999999
a friend I just say you know the family

5095.49 --> 5101.07
means and there was a bit of a Cuban on

5098.43 --> 5104.01
behind em and a few what of all US or

5101.07 --> 5108.599999999999
some of the ballers took they were

5104.01 --> 5110.7300000000005
taking a win kind of like wins when they

5108.6 --> 5113.370000000001
had no business taking data because they

5110.73 --> 5115.049999999999
were yeah but I just

5113.37 --> 5117.8099999999995
if you don't mind I bow to it won't take

5115.05 --> 5121.92
only a few minutes they were asking a

5117.81 --> 5123.450000000001
sports game oh hell calm how could he

5121.92 --> 5126.18
explain with the Flat Earth model

5123.45 --> 5128.099999999999
basically of model thing how can he

5126.18 --> 5130.740000000001
explain that in places like Afghanistan

5128.1 --> 5135.09
in the summer time that they can have

5130.74 --> 5137.5199999999995
mountains that have snow on them and at

5135.09 --> 5139.62
that time he was so bombarded with

5137.52 --> 5142.1
questions that he wasn't able to answer

5139.62 --> 5145.68
properly and it's just a simple case of

5142.1 --> 5147.450000000001
of in them in the winter time in places

5145.68 --> 5149.55
like that they have a huge amount of

5147.45 --> 5150.65
snow noise Frank and in the summertime

5149.55 --> 5153.2300000000005
it meds but a warm

5150.65 --> 5155.66
at the top and mountains because even in

5153.23 --> 5158.9
Australia all year round in the Blue

5155.66 --> 5160.58
Mountains they have snow over a thousand

5158.9 --> 5161.99
or more City I know he's up at the top

5160.58 --> 5166.04
at the Blue Mountain so yeah how's the

5161.99 --> 5167.929999999999
humidity there in Australia or in

5166.04 --> 5169.49
Afghanistan well in Afghanistan I'm

5167.93 --> 5171.320000000001
pretty sure what it is but how is it

5169.49 --> 5174.8
there in Australia with that example you

5171.32 --> 5176.929999999999
just gave well it was very humid it

5174.8 --> 5180.8
would be very like Asia very location a

5176.93 --> 5182.6
lot of you know in a very like Asia and

5180.8 --> 5184.9400000000005
basically they were kind of bombarding

5182.6 --> 5186.14
him and kind of not leaving them he

5184.94 --> 5188.0
wasn't he able to think straight because

5186.14 --> 5189.410000000001
he kind of got sidetracked and said

5188.0 --> 5191.84
something he said the wrong thing

5189.41 --> 5193.22
about ten minutes beforehand and he kept

5191.84 --> 5194.93
on having different avoid a fight that

5193.22 --> 5196.280000000001
he shouldn't importance I fainted but it

5194.93 --> 5199.400000000001
just it just happened you know but a lot

5196.28 --> 5203.0
of people talking across pause yeah but

5199.4 --> 5205.19
but but it went on from there where he

5203.0 --> 5207.26
where he mentioned well he said well

5205.19 --> 5211.07
help him blister 24:04 or so on in the

5207.26 --> 5215.51
Arctic and it's cold there and there

5211.07 --> 5217.28
Brenda the boiler Brenda she and a

5215.51 --> 5219.2300000000005
couple of others say Jay how come you

5217.28 --> 5221.24
can't explain that on the flat out and

5219.23 --> 5222.379999999999
he was kind of lost out he couldn't he

5221.24 --> 5224.48
just couldn't get his words out he

5222.38 --> 5225.77
couldn't think straight as I said

5224.48 --> 5228.08
because he had said something earlier at

5225.77 --> 5230.570000000001
the Antarctic air and that put him I on

5228.08 --> 5232.76
the back force for then they kind of

5230.57 --> 5235.25
took a win but it's like in the in the

5232.76 --> 5238.1
summer time I just want to clear up in

5235.25 --> 5240.32
the deserts you will have places at high

5238.1 --> 5243.200000000001
altitude will have snow and ice on them

5240.32 --> 5245.719999999999
regardless to what shape of the idea you

5243.2 --> 5247.55
believe the out is because the if

5245.72 --> 5249.77
they're so high up there so high up that

5247.55 --> 5251.75
the air is so thin up there that they

5249.77 --> 5253.43
know it's not gonna get the heat he

5251.75 --> 5256.13
comes to the ground where all the oxygen

5253.43 --> 5259.1
and air molecules all right yeah exactly

5256.13 --> 5261.89
the heat is basically the absorption of

5259.1 --> 5263.990000000001
daylight on the surface where most of

5261.89 --> 5266.63
the light is absorbed and that heat can

5263.99 --> 5268.34
transfer through the air but if the air

5266.63 --> 5271.28
becomes really thin at some point then

5268.34 --> 5273.53
that heat transfer will not happen as as

5271.28 --> 5274.94
much exactly yeah well if you were in an

5273.53 --> 5277.009999999999
airplane if you step outside the

5274.94 --> 5278.179999999999
airplane you'd be freezing cold John I

5277.01 --> 5280.04
mean I know they all claim to be higher

5278.18 --> 5281.240000000001
than a mountain but that's the thing it

5280.04 --> 5282.83
gets colder because the air gets thinner

5281.24 --> 5284.449
and some of those mountains are

5282.83 --> 5286.579
thousands of feet high so

5284.449 --> 5288.049999999999
places like Afghanistan the uploads and

5286.579 --> 5289.219
all the mountains so you afford to have

5288.05 --> 5292.13
places where resist

5289.219 --> 5294.11
that's not today what what saw is you

5292.13 --> 5297.05
believe or shaped even if the out is or

5294.11 --> 5298.61
hell big or you believe the Sony's I

5297.05 --> 5300.17
hope far away it's got to do with the

5298.61 --> 5302.42
air molecules that's what it's got to do

5300.17 --> 5304.34
with but so they were taking a victory

5302.42 --> 5307.429
on that they had no business saying but

5304.34 --> 5309.889
then about works because Brenda and I

5307.429 --> 5312.17
think the Dean is a team did a lot he

5309.889 --> 5314.51
got some young nation show at all they

5312.17 --> 5317.09
were Brenda ever state kind of was kind

5314.51 --> 5318.9490000000005
of a turning on sports chemo and kind of

5317.09 --> 5321.079
talking down to him I think she seemed

5318.949 --> 5323.299999999999
in your chart there she was yeah yeah I

5321.079 --> 5326.768999999999
know I know I brain has been on my show

5323.3 --> 5329.929
I'm very well familiar with her she's

5326.769 --> 5331.639
she was she was talking down to him and

5329.929 --> 5334.329
he was just what happened him as he said

5331.639 --> 5337.01
the wrong thing a few minutes beforehand

5334.329 --> 5337.728999999999
what something he couldn't support that

5337.01 --> 5339.8
was basically it

5337.729 --> 5342.7390000000005
and he was he just couldn't a couldn't

5339.8 --> 5345.019
get his tour to but she was taking a win

5342.739 --> 5348.32
that in some way that he could not so

5345.019 --> 5351.4400000000005
why why it's all a toy see yeah well it

5348.32 --> 5354.049999999999
was a 24 hours on in the summertime in

5351.44 --> 5356.388999999999
in the Arctic but it's not all the hill

5354.05 --> 5358.9400000000005
all the ocean sheets melt the whole case

5356.389 --> 5360.4400000000005
comes alive there's animals or all over

5358.94 --> 5362.959
the place anywhere close to the Arctic

5360.44 --> 5364.518999999999
Circle and then there is loads of plant

5362.959 --> 5366.559
life and everything homes a Lloyd it's

5364.519 --> 5368.059
in the wintertime that's frozen so she

5366.559 --> 5370.219
had no business taking that ain't no

5368.059 --> 5372.53
missus take and now I was I wasn't I was

5370.219 --> 5373.789
only a recording of Jose show so I

5372.53 --> 5374.69
couldn't do I'm the Builder but notice I

5373.789 --> 5375.889
was terrible

5374.69 --> 5377.329
I was Sheldon at the phone when it's

5375.889 --> 5379.579
gonna go and you're focused is taken as

5377.329 --> 5381.38
a win and she it was like as if they

5379.579 --> 5383.268999999999
knew that he he he just couldn't think

5381.38 --> 5385.249
straight at the time and were taken this

5383.269 --> 5386.51
as a win and she knew that if she knew

5385.249 --> 5388.249
didn't that's all mourn that didn't

5386.51 --> 5390.229
happen but she still talked about some

5388.249 --> 5392.989
kind of a victory yes yeah but they

5390.229 --> 5395.900000000001
consider red herring and burning straw

5392.989 --> 5398.9
man's as a victory so they'll just swamp

5395.9 --> 5401.808999999999
the opponent with a body with a body of

5398.9 --> 5403.789
arguments and spurs chemo is not exactly

5401.809 --> 5405.26
the type of person that's really

5403.789 --> 5407.719
mentally flexible

5405.26 --> 5410.3
he's like a more long winded train of

5407.719 --> 5413.42
thought guy more the conversationalist

5410.3 --> 5416.389
then they in some ways may find it in

5413.42 --> 5417.36
his thinking so he needs to follow the

5416.389 --> 5419.13
his birth

5417.36 --> 5421.86
if he's gonna be slapped with red

5419.13 --> 5423.63
herrings all the time yeah yeah take a

5421.86 --> 5426.9
month yeah exactly it'll be be railed

5423.63 --> 5428.909000000001
yes the real well if they for Dame if

5426.9 --> 5431.5199999999995
they're here if she happens to hear this

5428.909 --> 5434.549999999999
wait what she she needs to answer is

5431.52 --> 5436.860000000001
he'll calm the Antarctic out the

5434.55 --> 5440.13
Antarctic doesn't melt because there's

5436.86 --> 5443.369
no there is no explanation that is

5440.13 --> 5445.29
possible but there is an anyway that is

5443.369 --> 5447.839999999999
anyway if they're available and in any

5445.29 --> 5449.88
way realistic as the way the Antarctic

5447.84 --> 5451.860000000001
doesn't melt in the so long summer it

5449.88 --> 5454.86
doesn't melt is much change in the

5451.86 --> 5457.349999999999
degrees of it but it doesn't matter

5454.86 --> 5459.63
I'd never fool know there's a lot of it

5457.35 --> 5462.659000000001
that doesn't go very well you retract

5459.63 --> 5465.81
the sea ocean ice it definitely retract

5462.659 --> 5469.32
sand sometimes but it always grows back

5465.81 --> 5471.389
again but the mate is never like there

5469.32 --> 5474.65
is nothing it doesn't it's not like I

5471.389 --> 5478.11
mean maybe on there wasp an incident yes

5474.65 --> 5480.719
yes or no it's never in no never melt

5478.11 --> 5482.13
that's true the fact that they have like

5480.719 --> 5483.4800000000005
the fact that I'm not saying those

5482.13 --> 5485.400000000001
always Wars all around the place I'm not

5483.48 --> 5487.379999999999
saying that laughs but there is places

5485.4 --> 5489.15
where those huge expanses one hundred

5487.38 --> 5491.31
and hundred fifty foot holy wars voice

5489.15 --> 5493.138999999999
so if they are there it's not just

5491.31 --> 5494.79
something that we've seen recently we've

5493.139 --> 5496.679
been shown pictures at it or damned our

5494.79 --> 5498.42
whole lives and that's the only place in

5496.679 --> 5500.219
the world it could be there is places

5498.42 --> 5502.08
like that where I wrote the daily calm

5500.219 --> 5504.78
if there's a sovereign somewhere every

5502.08 --> 5506.4
year and the outer supposed to tilt hell

5504.78 --> 5507.179
were they there you know what they

5506.4 --> 5509.549999999999
shouldn't be there

5507.179 --> 5511.35
how did they get there how did they get

5509.55 --> 5513.09
there on the force base so that's what

5511.35 --> 5515.159000000001
they need to be answered not to be not

5513.09 --> 5517.2300000000005
to be not to be taken a win when it's

5515.159 --> 5519.719
not a win because they knew she knew

5517.23 --> 5521.61
that spores was was on the back for her

5519.719 --> 5522.81
not thinkin straight and she took a win

5521.61 --> 5526.049999999999
in a situation she had no business

5522.81 --> 5530.1
taking because because the Arctic some

5526.05 --> 5531.869000000001
are dogs melt all the ice no other word

5530.1 --> 5533.85
no I don't know it's they still won't be

5531.869 --> 5535.92
hold but there is places there in the

5533.85 --> 5538.38
Arctic Circle that can be up to 23 or

5535.92 --> 5540.0
sorry 20 20 degrees on a summer's day

5538.38 --> 5542.52
right that happens

5540.0 --> 5546.15
well you wanna mean it's Greenland like

5542.52 --> 5548.429
yes yeah it's always about the sea look

5546.15 --> 5550.7699999999995
when ice is gonna melt it's gonna be due

5548.429 --> 5552.66
to the temperature of the sea

5550.77 --> 5556.17
that's what makes it crumble down every

5552.66 --> 5558.63
time then a certain warm heated up flow

5556.17 --> 5562.35
comes in and starts melting at all and

5558.63 --> 5564.21
yeah the the supposed North Pole

5562.35 --> 5565.9800000000005
whatever that region is which is

5564.21 --> 5566.85
supposed to be oceanic yeah it can

5565.98 --> 5569.94
freeze over

5566.85 --> 5572.160000000001
partially or maybe not at all anymore I

5569.94 --> 5575.009999999999
don't know for sure and then it will

5572.16 --> 5576.87
melt all the way or parts of it and grow

5575.01 --> 5579.27
back depending on whatever is going to

5576.87 --> 5582.5599999999995
be the temperature and the sea

5579.27 --> 5585.81
temperature at the time but Greenland is

5582.56 --> 5588.02
also part of that basically it's one of

5585.81 --> 5590.43
the more comfort part of the Arctic and

5588.02 --> 5593.040000000001
there are parts I think of Greenland

5590.43 --> 5596.58
that just are frozen always but

5593.04 --> 5598.8
definitely not all of it no no no not

5596.58 --> 5600.36
when the shorelines there like a around

5598.8 --> 5603.12
the shorelines in this in in there in

5600.36 --> 5606.179999999999
the summer I mean on doesn't be in

5603.12 --> 5607.8
agreement yet the thing that cosine in a

5606.18 --> 5609.72
Greenland will always have a sentiment

5607.8 --> 5612.66
always to work yes not it's not in like

5609.72 --> 5615.81
IP Antarctic I mean well the end is just

5612.66 --> 5618.75
much bigger and there's only small parts

5615.81 --> 5622.5
of it that basically get ice-free at

5618.75 --> 5626.04
certain stages and but but they're still

5622.5 --> 5627.81
huge presumed chunks of land beyond that

5626.04 --> 5630.24
or whatever there's gone dead are just

5627.81 --> 5633.09
always frozen it's the vast majority and

5630.24 --> 5634.969999999999
that's not with with Greenland it's it's

5633.09 --> 5639.18
not the vast majority

5634.97 --> 5640.68
no it's just it's like if it's just that

5639.18 --> 5643.110000000001
the question they need to be answered is

5640.68 --> 5647.34
how come the Antarctic is so different

5643.11 --> 5650.13
than the Arctic as far as South holds

5647.34 --> 5652.32
authority all the explanations and none

5650.13 --> 5654.900000000001
of them much we could not possibly be

5652.32 --> 5657.24
ography right you know our of hell yeah

5654.9 --> 5659.009999999999
hell yeah at Arctic as this is massive

5657.24 --> 5660.69
she big massive rewards avoids not I

5659.01 --> 5662.55
maybe everyone but there isn't some

5660.69 --> 5665.82
places you don't know yeah look

5662.55 --> 5668.13
besides that even their explanations

5665.82 --> 5670.799999999999
about the seasons and the supposed orbit

5668.13 --> 5674.28
around the Sun that whole thing is

5670.8 --> 5676.53
ridiculous by its own standard the

5674.28 --> 5678.389999999999
elliptical orbits with the seasons and

5676.53 --> 5682.59
how that's supposed to work it's totally

5678.39 --> 5684.499000000001
ridiculous its little in your face like

5682.59 --> 5687.78
that doesn't make any sense

5684.499 --> 5689.76
no no I have to wait a time so they

5687.78 --> 5693.599
don't ever go Boyle explanations for the

5689.76 --> 5695.639
seasons in the first place no no why did

5693.599 --> 5697.499
we agree because it what it was is that

5695.639 --> 5700.9490000000005
why would all actually went wrong on

5697.499 --> 5703.019
sports game Oh was that he was being pop

5700.949 --> 5704.728999999999
out of protections and he said the

5703.019 --> 5706.9490000000005
antibiotic and then he was trying to

5704.729 --> 5708.659000000001
pack off the Antarctic and was a few

5706.949 --> 5710.07
other people there that were flat-out

5708.659 --> 5711.78
was with him and they were kind of

5710.07 --> 5713.489
trying to pack as well I could open you

5711.78 --> 5715.05
can't back up on the Betty Antarctic

5713.489 --> 5717.69
because nobody knows that in the Builder

5715.05 --> 5720.42
because a few I mean other than some

5717.69 --> 5722.579
scientific a geologist not the border

5720.42 --> 5723.869
who else we know goes there we don't

5722.579 --> 5724.499
know anyone the cause that we don't know

5723.869 --> 5727.32
I on the belly

5724.499 --> 5730.469
nobody there's some there's nobody

5727.32 --> 5730.92
really goes deeply inland ever or no

5730.469 --> 5733.289
wings

5730.92 --> 5735.329
oh but there are some individuals that

5733.289 --> 5739.889
are then sometimes very mysteriously

5735.329 --> 5743.909
going there remember remember there was

5739.889 --> 5751.289
like this weird John Kerry and he had no

5743.909 --> 5753.598999999999
reason before that remember this years

5751.289 --> 5757.739
ago now there was also this situation

5753.599 --> 5759.539
where this Orthodox priest I think when

5757.739 --> 5763.65
deployed and then a freaking the

5759.539 --> 5765.84
fireball hit like somewhere in Mecca so

5763.65 --> 5768.57
there's a weird [ __ ] going on every time

5765.84 --> 5771.2390000000005
and Arctica comes in the attention it's

5768.57 --> 5774.63
either you secret Nazi basis or a secret

5771.239 --> 5777.78
alien bases or some weird other thing

5774.63 --> 5780.2390000000005
but no there's no regular like let's go

5777.78 --> 5784.8
there it's always individuals know

5780.239 --> 5787.11
they're secretly what it is when people

5784.8 --> 5789.809
talk about going down the trips the

5787.11 --> 5791.909
goals are the cruise ships and a lot of

5789.809 --> 5793.92
scientific tips there aren't really

5791.909 --> 5796.86
going into you know they're not all one

5793.92 --> 5798.15
really want in our Antarctica a lot of

5796.86 --> 5800.88
them were just considered lost an

5798.15 --> 5802.978999999999
incident area and that they're not even

5800.88 --> 5806.309
going in deep their world particular

5802.979 --> 5808.92
places so like a no matter what's going

5806.309 --> 5810.63
on there if I was in a debate I kinda

5808.92 --> 5811.889
doubt you but I thought again I haven't

5810.63 --> 5814.32
got a clue what's going on yeah and

5811.889 --> 5817.2
that's kinda the point but I'm not

5814.32 --> 5818.88
now in our view I hope you build it

5817.2 --> 5822.0599999999995
because how can I argue with so many

5818.88 --> 5823.650000000001
builders because it's ridiculous me and

5822.06 --> 5825.900000000001
someone else are gonna better when we

5823.65 --> 5828.36
often really we don't know nobody knows

5825.9 --> 5832.0199999999995
that alone so just go talk about if

5828.36 --> 5834.599999999999
you're not that we can't we have a you

5832.02 --> 5837.110000000001
can but you gotta be careful what you're

5834.6 --> 5840.72
gonna be presupposing for whatever

5837.11 --> 5842.28
you're below but for now we do know

5840.72 --> 5845.55
certain things about it

5842.28 --> 5849.87
we know there's land we know there's a

5845.55 --> 5853.35
lot of eyes upon earth like much more

5849.87 --> 5859.8
ice and persistently so and anywhere

5853.35 --> 5862.92
else in the world including you know

5859.8 --> 5867.66
that there's views over the Antarctic

5862.92 --> 5870.8
that are just so deep so far apparently

5867.66 --> 5873.84
so that it must probably pretty big

5870.8 --> 5875.97
whatever it's been look look

5873.84 --> 5878.37
and that's pretty much it we don't

5875.97 --> 5879.87
really know what's under the ice What's

5878.37 --> 5882.72
in between the land what the land is

5879.87 --> 5891.12
like if they're at some point beyond

5882.72 --> 5891.6
places where there isn't any ice you

5891.12 --> 5895.53
hear me

5891.6 --> 5896.9400000000005
yes yeah one of my head won't want to be

5895.53 --> 5898.44
blue to headphones just been dead on me

5896.94 --> 5901.5599999999995
they also have to switch then as well at

5898.44 --> 5902.94
all yeah your sounds low ready now yeah

5901.56 --> 5906.96
their microphone on this one is better

5902.94 --> 5909.389999999999
and no I just as far what happened is

5906.96 --> 5912.6
that I don't think it's a good direction

5909.39 --> 5914.34
to go when you're debating because we no

5912.6 --> 5916.02
one can prove whatever whatever was

5914.34 --> 5918.18
going on there people can say like the

5916.02 --> 5921.21
board so it will say all we know this

5918.18 --> 5922.740000000001
and that we know all about this okay you

5921.21 --> 5924.75
don't know what about really missing all

5922.74 --> 5927.179999999999
they are to the rusted Internet trust

5924.75 --> 5929.43
Peninsula is way off face away from the

5927.18 --> 5931.530000000001
what they what they would well if you

5929.43 --> 5935.04
are going by there the globe version of

5931.53 --> 5937.46
us as big huge lair voice mass at the

5935.04 --> 5939.81
bottom like the Ross Peninsula is Wales

5937.46 --> 5941.67
on the edge of it you're not going away

5939.81 --> 5943.02
it's you're not seeing any of us what

5941.67 --> 5945.2
what I hope you give an arrow give it

5943.02 --> 5947.4890000000005
all we know is just a lot of words

5945.2 --> 5949.86
[Applause]

5947.489 --> 5955.739
all we know is that it's just an order

5949.86 --> 5959.429999999999
voice a lot of voice oh I see yes well

5955.739 --> 5961.95
ice and land but land isn't learning why

5959.43 --> 5963.6900000000005
does but I don't know I actually think

5961.95 --> 5966.42
it better believe it's right to be a

5963.69 --> 5968.19
debate uh I couldn't even say that

5966.42 --> 5971.25
that's behind the orcas are yeah I know

5968.19 --> 5974.25
I think I can safely say that I've seen

5971.25 --> 5976.56
persistent features of Antarctica and

5974.25 --> 5979.5
there's definitely land there at least

5976.56 --> 5981.719
at some part of it yeah well I've seen

5979.5 --> 5983.25
I've seen photographs of Antarctica

5981.719 --> 5985.53
where there has been like in the

5983.25 --> 5987.239
summertime what was being a melt

5985.53 --> 5988.7699999999995
happened but as I said that's mostly

5987.239 --> 5992.25
under Boston because they call it the

5988.77 --> 5994.4400000000005
wasps Peninsula I think I said it that

5992.25 --> 5997.86
way where there has like pools of land

5994.44 --> 5999.239
that go off out into the sea and it's I

5997.86 --> 6001.299999999999
think it's over on there I think it's

5999.239 --> 6002.54
heading towards South America damp out

6001.3 --> 6007.18
yes

6002.54 --> 6009.89
so I yeah I probably saw in Chile and

6007.18 --> 6012.35
that is the most inhabited part of

6009.89 --> 6014.75
Antarctica pretty much part that makes

6012.35 --> 6016.370000000001
sense it's also the part where the

6014.75 --> 6019.67
weather becomes the mildest

6016.37 --> 6021.62
and most survive yeah yeah yeah and it's

6019.67 --> 6025.1
always stuffed with freakin Penguins

6021.62 --> 6027.26
every time that's right go with the

6025.1 --> 6028.43
penguins because it's the only place war

6027.26 --> 6029.93
beans because it's the only place is

6028.43 --> 6032.3
gonna be honest all Jeff Fordham I

6029.93 --> 6035.87
suppose they're not kind of in it but a

6032.3 --> 6040.54
but the fact that the thing about it is

6035.87 --> 6044.239
is that is that once on in Jose's a

6040.54 --> 6046.31
debate once a sports game or mentioned

6044.239 --> 6047.54
and our ticket he was on the back for

6046.31 --> 6050.780000000001
twenty answer a lot of questions

6047.54 --> 6052.219
internal and it's just it's like there's

6050.78 --> 6053.66
only so much you can answer a bedroom

6052.219 --> 6055.55
before you have to put hands off me I'll

6053.66 --> 6057.95
go look I don't I don't know your

6055.55 --> 6060.5
academic you know I don't know what's

6057.95 --> 6064.429999999999
going on yeah right you know it if

6060.5 --> 6066.92
there's a mysterious place right yeah

6064.43 --> 6069.8
but we always love to do that look we

6066.92 --> 6071.42
are just being on it trying to be honest

6069.8 --> 6073.070000000001
and saying like look there's a lot of

6071.42 --> 6076.61
stuff we don't know and what you assume

6073.07 --> 6078.62
is yeah presuppositional you have no

6076.61 --> 6080.96
actual proof of that what the ballers

6078.62 --> 6084.28
their mindset is is

6080.96 --> 6088.7
we have information that basically

6084.28 --> 6093.0199999999995
declares that it explains it all and and

6088.7 --> 6095.8099999999995
they basically ridicule us for saying

6093.02 --> 6097.660000000001
even or admitting like yeah we don't

6095.81 --> 6100.01
know it all like oh that's so pathetic

6097.66 --> 6101.84
you're still trying to figure it out why

6100.01 --> 6104.030000000001
don't you just look at our informations

6101.84 --> 6106.01
which has explanations for everything

6104.03 --> 6108.92
even though they don't completely make

6106.01 --> 6111.08
sense at least we have an explanation

6108.92 --> 6113.87
and they think that is kind of like an

6111.08 --> 6115.489
authority effect that that has Authority

6113.87 --> 6119.38
naturally and that's wrong

6115.489 --> 6122.089999999999
it's peer pressure it's not authorities

6119.38 --> 6126.55
know that they were using that tactic a

6122.09 --> 6130.4890000000005
lot with our scheme oh and in database

6126.55 --> 6132.860000000001
because it was like well you can prove

6130.489 --> 6134.8099999999995
it for yourself whatever was we doing

6132.86 --> 6136.94
this our podium - and that's all you

6134.81 --> 6138.469
have to do as if like proof for all

6136.94 --> 6140.739
these things were that easy the convoy

6138.469 --> 6143.9800000000005
is the convoy it won't be flat out on

6140.739 --> 6145.82
you know it's not going to be thing but

6143.98 --> 6147.41
when you're talking about something like

6145.82 --> 6149.8099999999995
Antarctica they are going to have a

6147.41 --> 6151.88
whole lured whole load more information

6149.81 --> 6153.77
even though even though it's going to be

6151.88 --> 6155.150000000001
majority of it is going to be a heap of

6153.77 --> 6156.580000000001
rubbish it would be selling stuff in

6155.15 --> 6158.66
there it's true

6156.58 --> 6160.85
most people if you start about

6158.66 --> 6164.51
Antarctica it will be all about secret

6160.85 --> 6167.93
Nazi bases or aliens because that's what

6164.51 --> 6171.02
the the standards alternative media

6167.93 --> 6174.02
concerning Globes and NASA [ __ ] is now

6171.02 --> 6176.540000000001
pumping out so everybody said oh that's

6174.02 --> 6180.05
so all so exciting what could be their

6176.54 --> 6182.15
fantasy I maybe know they're not

6180.05 --> 6184.070000000001
conceptualizing what that place actually

6182.15 --> 6185.599999999999
is now they're just thinking they're

6184.07 --> 6187.429999999999
just being made to think about what

6185.6 --> 6192.26
secrets could be there that could

6187.43 --> 6195.17
benefit mankind humanity right that's

6192.26 --> 6196.969
the distraction well well the mainstream

6195.17 --> 6200.81
are either just saying it's either just

6196.969 --> 6203.21
a place that is being kind of kept safe

6200.81 --> 6204.68
from any environmental problems and

6203.21 --> 6206.81
there's a lot of scientific and

6204.68 --> 6208.400000000001
geological or calendar or they're

6206.81 --> 6212.330000000001
telling people's or secret Nazi based

6208.4 --> 6213.5199999999995
it's like like one is a very boring and

6212.33 --> 6217.63
bland and

6213.52 --> 6221.68
and the other one this big secret nazi

6217.63 --> 6224.95
basis with pyramids and and and hold on

6221.68 --> 6229.150000000001
hold on also special landing basis for

6224.95 --> 6231.25
their UFO alien allies so now we have so

6229.15 --> 6233.82
much to imagine you can build a movie

6231.25 --> 6237.04
out of it and probably the idea has been

6233.82 --> 6241.87
yeah exactly that probably would be Iran

6237.04 --> 6242.41
cross yeah and more the alien versus

6241.87 --> 6245.349999999999
Predator

6242.41 --> 6247.0599999999995
or you combine all of it and then you

6245.35 --> 6250.360000000001
get this story that we're all supposed

6247.06 --> 6254.92
to be pondering upon well the operators

6250.36 --> 6259.44
are it not services aliens and like

6254.92 --> 6262.93
hidden historical UFO contacts and

6259.44 --> 6264.79
miraculous UFO technology all integrated

6262.93 --> 6266.8
into their secret society that all

6264.79 --> 6270.16
vanished and died out for no good reason

6266.8 --> 6272.14
and then whenever that's supposed to be

6270.16 --> 6274.84
revealed it's just gonna be like oh yeah

6272.14 --> 6278.37
we just stumbled into this just like

6274.84 --> 6281.56
alien versus Predator it's amazing yeah

6278.37 --> 6284.65
it's a mystery actually but it's the

6281.56 --> 6286.4800000000005
wrong mystery tell you they probably

6284.65 --> 6289.299999999999
figured that out like 50 years ago and

6286.48 --> 6291.339999999999
basically exterminated everyone like oh

6289.3 --> 6298.150000000001
look at what we found the mysterious

6291.34 --> 6300.46
ruins or didn't know about at all even

6298.15 --> 6302.5
even even into the piece that was going

6300.46 --> 6305.34
on they brought up people who attack

6302.5 --> 6314.26
over crossed over Antarctica no

6305.34 --> 6316.6
preparation right you well no no wait

6314.26 --> 6319.570000000001
wait which one was it operation no there

6316.6 --> 6321.9400000000005
was a specific secret military operation

6319.57 --> 6324.34
and not even talking about the testing

6321.94 --> 6327.58
of the interdimensional thing but that

6324.34 --> 6329.35
ship that weirdly people warping inside

6327.58 --> 6331.2699999999995
of the deck and that ship and I'm

6329.35 --> 6334.21
talking about at some point there was

6331.27 --> 6336.67
just a big fleet kind of like out of the

6334.21 --> 6338.7390000000005
blue just like yeah we have to go to the

6336.67 --> 6341.41
Arctic and they all just disappeared

6338.739 --> 6346.0
they're never seen back and they thought

6341.41 --> 6346.57
of war like that's the way to end our to

6346.0 --> 6349.0
guess or the

6346.57 --> 6352.21
talk about because I couldn't prove that

6349.0 --> 6354.73
right there's a lot of [ __ ] shipwrecks

6352.21 --> 6357.55
like in the deeper the deeper ocean

6354.73 --> 6359.5599999999995
regions now what did ever is beyond

6357.55 --> 6361.6
there it's probably a lot of shipwrecks

6359.56 --> 6362.92
on the bottom of the ocean there right

6361.6 --> 6364.54
now I say there's a lot more yeah

6362.92 --> 6366.4
there's a lot more rare shipwrecks than

6364.54 --> 6368.59
we ignore bill you know I can do it

6366.4 --> 6372.91
no mother your ex all these warships

6368.59 --> 6375.22
that have gone at each other probably do

6372.91 --> 6377.17
both and all that [ __ ] from the Nazis

6375.22 --> 6378.610000000001
well yeah any of it I say now world war

6377.17 --> 6381.25
ii there was a lot of saying a world war

6378.61 --> 6383.65
ii if there was that went on and he

6381.25 --> 6385.81
fighting my dawn down they are I say AHA

6383.65 --> 6388.12
there is the boats in your boats auto

6385.81 --> 6390.34
ships that went down was Tjuta was due

6388.12 --> 6390.73
to the conditions there or something

6390.34 --> 6393.31
like that

6390.73 --> 6396.549999999999
no well if they hit a freaking ice Burke

6393.31 --> 6398.59
you know bang or they get frozen stuck

6396.55 --> 6401.08
with flash freeze yes well that happened

6398.59 --> 6404.4400000000005
the traveler and suddenly they're stuck

6401.08 --> 6410.59
in a cage of ice that's kind of [ __ ]

6404.44 --> 6413.049999999999
happens is that as far as arguing about

6410.59 --> 6415.24
that you can't really argue in it to

6413.05 --> 6417.34
being innovative because it's like

6415.24 --> 6420.01
there's so many different mysteries and

6417.34 --> 6422.26
suppose the truth the better you can't

6420.01 --> 6424.0
really even if they were in even Admiral

6422.26 --> 6427.030000000001
Borg in an admirable

6424.0 --> 6429.13
like I couldn't guarantee at that board

6427.03 --> 6431.38
said is true I could guarantee yeah over

6429.13 --> 6433.87
that they hit the big deposit the gold

6431.38 --> 6435.85
anything I couldn't do any I wanted I

6433.87 --> 6439.0599999999995
want to respond to that because I had

6435.85 --> 6441.79
like a weird realization idea about that

6439.06 --> 6444.490000000001
look what if on look at a room bird

6441.79 --> 6447.79
everybody remembers from us from the

6444.49 --> 6451.75
earlier revelations like he said there

6447.79 --> 6454.87
are mountains of uranium and steel and

6451.75 --> 6458.17
and all that on the television on the

6454.87 --> 6462.849999999999
television yes so I figured out what is

6458.17 --> 6465.31
that it seems almost absurdly unlikely

6462.85 --> 6469.09
that was literally the case because if

6465.31 --> 6470.830000000001
it would that could not have been not

6469.09 --> 6473.650000000001
harvested they would have gone after it

6470.83 --> 6476.83
even illegally and there will be this

6473.65 --> 6479.11
net income from all these materials or

6476.83 --> 6480.339
you could have made it up for a very

6479.11 --> 6483.0689999999995
specific reason

6480.339 --> 6485.019
and now hear me out about this so

6483.069 --> 6487.659000000001
Admiral Burt went there okay that's

6485.019 --> 6490.179
pretty certain he did his thing with the

6487.659 --> 6494.199
wider knowledge what might have happened

6490.179 --> 6497.769
is that he really went to explore very

6494.199 --> 6501.0689999999995
very very far farther than anyone has

6497.769 --> 6503.439
ever gone yeah and then he just figured

6501.069 --> 6505.089000000001
out I can't go on this is just not

6503.439 --> 6507.189
doable with what we got

6505.089 --> 6510.849
we need like almost that's just a

6507.189 --> 6512.499000000001
spacesuit level technology to protect

6510.849 --> 6515.859
against this called we can never go

6512.499 --> 6518.199
beyond this so he then went back instead

6515.859 --> 6521.349
of just saying this is just impossible

6518.199 --> 6525.759999999999
he said there's mountains of gold there

6521.349 --> 6528.55
in order to in the future if this false

6525.76 --> 6530.530000000001
promise to basically get people to

6528.55 --> 6534.01
actually put down the technology and

6530.53 --> 6535.959
together to really attempt to go out

6534.01 --> 6537.939
there in these impossible conditions and

6535.959 --> 6541.688999999999
really actually figure out what is

6537.939 --> 6545.379
beyond yeah how about you know how about

6541.689 --> 6547.569
that well it very likely yeah I mean you

6545.379 --> 6549.789
can look you really could have done it

6547.569 --> 6552.389
because of that for that motivation well

6549.789 --> 6554.709
no that's that's a possibility because

6552.389 --> 6556.809
anything that makes any kind of logical

6554.709 --> 6558.6089999999995
sense is the possibility because we

6556.809 --> 6561.6990000000005
don't they're kind of kind of the point

6558.609 --> 6563.979
I'm making is that your yours and your

6561.699 --> 6566.379
your version of what probably the event

6563.979 --> 6570.099
is as good as the next house is because

6566.379 --> 6574.78
but but you have to have it when people

6570.099 --> 6577.179
do things for reasons and they cannot be

6574.78 --> 6579.459
ignored so yeah you can definitely get a

6577.179 --> 6582.55
gauge yet what are the possible angles

6579.459 --> 6585.459
to why this is done including if it were

6582.55 --> 6588.189
a lie and then you have only so many

6585.459 --> 6590.469
options left basically so that's what I

6588.189 --> 6593.169
try to do and just think could it be

6590.469 --> 6595.629
true how likely is that and if he lied

6593.169 --> 6596.8589999999995
why would he do that people never lie

6595.629 --> 6600.579
for no good reason

6596.859 --> 6603.099
basically he filmed absolutely nothing

6600.579 --> 6605.228999999999
or he found something you like anyway

6603.099 --> 6608.459
it's one or the other you know I found

6605.229 --> 6611.619000000001
something that is that that is not

6608.459 --> 6614.0199999999995
something that we are being allowed to

6611.619 --> 6616.03
be privy to some kind of information

6614.02 --> 6618.400000000001
then you would have never I would have

6616.03 --> 6620.71
never said it if that was really the

6618.4 --> 6622.96
case seriously he would have never been

6620.71 --> 6626.32
allowed to say that in the open like

6622.96 --> 6628.3
that I have a feeling that I have a

6626.32 --> 6631.0599999999995
feeling that like when it when he what

6628.3 --> 6633.31
when he mentioned coal I was like right

6631.06 --> 6635.860000000001
coal I remember like okay at the time

6633.31 --> 6638.77
when he mentioned that coal would have

6635.86 --> 6641.139999999999
been used as a fuel source maybe in the

6638.77 --> 6643.360000000001
mainstream a lot more than it is

6641.14 --> 6645.67
maybe nail you know everyone probably

6643.36 --> 6648.099999999999
had coal coal fires and our houses and

6645.67 --> 6650.83
stuff like that the reason for that is

6648.1 --> 6654.55
is the industrial angle to it

6650.83 --> 6657.16
because if there was gold the coal is

6654.55 --> 6659.71
the easiest resource to quickly process

6657.16 --> 6663.01
into energy generation if you want to

6659.71 --> 6665.95
build an industry in a remote region so

6663.01 --> 6667.570000000001
that's why it's ours

6665.95 --> 6670.2
you know you can build a nuclear power

6667.57 --> 6672.73
plant but that takes a long damn time

6670.2 --> 6674.38
yes you can get up and run and we're

6672.73 --> 6677.62
cold really fast exactly so that's

6674.38 --> 6679.4800000000005
probably why I included there yes that's

6677.62 --> 6684.64
true no that's a good angle yeah good

6679.48 --> 6686.379999999999
angle yeah see it's kinda it's kind of

6684.64 --> 6690.04
phase B back to the original point was

6686.38 --> 6692.77
making no matter what we what story or

6690.04 --> 6695.62
even come up a builder at a concerning

6692.77 --> 6699.31
or whatever is the only route however

6695.62 --> 6701.349999999999
I'm more bored days okay I can't debate

6699.31 --> 6703.780000000001
like ordinarily were against the global

6701.35 --> 6705.370000000001
weather because I can't prevent it and

6703.78 --> 6706.96
the beauty of it is is that they can't

6705.37 --> 6710.17
prove any of it but they believe they

6706.96 --> 6714.94
can it's like as I can try to tell them

6710.17 --> 6717.01
look you can't prove any it is just you

6714.94 --> 6723.61
know nobody knows nothing about it the

6717.01 --> 6725.56
whole thing is we will look now I'm

6723.61 --> 6728.92
getting going to go a little bit weird

6725.56 --> 6730.870000000001
but yeah I fish in memories and I'm

6728.92 --> 6733.03
pretty damn certain for some reason

6730.87 --> 6736.51
there is going to be deep exploration

6733.03 --> 6740.71
into Antarctica that might actually be

6736.51 --> 6742.99
an actual real frontier like they're

6740.71 --> 6746.17
going to explore Regis because they now

6742.99 --> 6748.92
have the technology with the materials

6746.17 --> 6748.92
being like

6750.52 --> 6758.06
complex complex molecular materials all

6755.21 --> 6760.19
that well that will enable to actually

6758.06 --> 6761.900000000001
go through these conditions and with the

6760.19 --> 6766.91
inter with the flat earth basically

6761.9 --> 6769.46
surfacing up maybe a revelation of this

6766.91 --> 6772.3099999999995
combined it will be a new project and

6769.46 --> 6775.31
the funny thing is I've even seen this

6772.31 --> 6776.6900000000005
reflected in freakin games and I'm not

6775.31 --> 6781.240000000001
talking about first person but like

6776.69 --> 6783.83
freaking online games like those simple

6781.24 --> 6786.7699999999995
development games and there's like whoa

6783.83 --> 6791.96
the Arctic age when Arctic exploration

6786.77 --> 6793.820000000001
happen what what you know so I think it

6791.96 --> 6795.65
is gonna happen they're gonna it is

6793.82 --> 6800.42
really a thing that probably has never

6795.65 --> 6802.61
been done ever by recorded man and they

6800.42 --> 6806.06
really want to try it but they still try

6802.61 --> 6808.91
to uphold the whole ball myth right now

6806.06 --> 6811.580000000001
well well the table is is that you can't

6808.91 --> 6814.91
hold back the toiiet forever you know

6811.58 --> 6817.16
it's like eventually eventually it's

6814.91 --> 6819.79
like they know they know that there's no

6817.16 --> 6823.46
way to stop people wanting to know and

6819.79 --> 6825.47
people eventually will want to know you

6823.46 --> 6827.93
know at the moment it's mostly flat out

6825.47 --> 6829.64
people and now that wanted or some

6827.93 --> 6831.530000000001
conspiracy people maybe are into

6829.64 --> 6833.360000000001
conspiracy stuff but I don't believe I

6831.53 --> 6836.63
don't say flat-out people as conspiracy

6833.36 --> 6838.339999999999
people regardless why whatever things

6836.63 --> 6840.05
they might have watched are being

6838.34 --> 6843.05
interred before flat out flat out is not

6840.05 --> 6845.45
really conspiracy but the other than

6843.05 --> 6848.81
conspiracy believe that Nazi base is

6845.45 --> 6851.2699999999995
there or the flat-out belief of what is

6848.81 --> 6853.280000000001
there is the more past that what has

6851.27 --> 6855.620000000001
gone on there eventually that's gonna

6853.28 --> 6857.66
grow within the general public people

6855.62 --> 6859.82
are going to want to know what's going

6857.66 --> 6862.49
on there right no it's only so long you

6859.82 --> 6866.24
can hold up that toy back so I take a

6862.49 --> 6868.16
second there slowly bleeding in things

6866.24 --> 6871.16
in a way where they can keep control of

6868.16 --> 6873.0199999999995
you know that's where I view that's it

6871.16 --> 6875.0599999999995
because I they know what he can't all

6873.02 --> 6876.110000000001
the back Trevor like it's like because

6875.06 --> 6877.67
only a matter of time before people

6876.11 --> 6879.29
started being able to see for

6877.67 --> 6880.729
orientation they they can they ever

6879.29 --> 6882.559
could before with

6880.729 --> 6883.249000000001
and stuff like that and I and then

6882.559 --> 6884.78
they're gonna be asking questions

6883.249 --> 6886.82
eventually some people when asked

6884.78 --> 6888.518999999999
questions I technology gets better

6886.82 --> 6892.219
your people are gonna ask questions

6888.519 --> 6894.519
you're right so it's like thank you how

6892.219 --> 6899.63
long is it how long is it gonna take for

6894.519 --> 6902.119000000001
people to eventually be able to craft a

6899.63 --> 6903.76
long-distance and drone just for

6902.119 --> 6907.039
exploration a completely

6903.76 --> 6909.229
self-controlling drone that just goes as

6907.039 --> 6911.78
far as it can and then returns and

6909.229 --> 6914.269
everything recorded you know you don't

6911.78 --> 6915.978999999999
even have to be mad with it how long is

6914.269 --> 6918.559
it gonna take before somebody that makes

6915.979 --> 6921.05
such a thing for like $20,000 or

6918.559 --> 6923.179
something you know well if you could

6921.05 --> 6925.219
take in if you were drawn and you could

6923.179 --> 6930.079
take in if you could take in

6925.219 --> 6932.479
condensation and use that as a fuel but

6930.079 --> 6935.989
it would be on fire it would be a trial

6932.479 --> 6939.320000000001
like yeah let's go oh it's precious [ __ ]

6935.989 --> 6940.968999999999
why did it crash I mean it wouldn't

6939.32 --> 6942.829
happen you wouldn't have to make a big

6940.969 --> 6946.599
at the toilet error you can't make them

6942.829 --> 6950.989
a lot yeah and not all material ground

6946.599 --> 6952.309
conversation well not a not like well it

6950.989 --> 6954.138999999999
doesn't have to be military drone

6952.309 --> 6957.409000000001
doesn't have to have weaponry just have

6954.139 --> 6960.32
to be durable and have good sensory

6957.409 --> 6963.469
equipment so it wouldn't have to be that

6960.32 --> 6965.299999999999
big necessarily have to keep on that's

6963.469 --> 6967.28
the biggest pop me enough it's just the

6965.3 --> 6969.289
distance you can go right and it doesn't

6967.28 --> 6971.719
have to be bigger to keep on going

6969.289 --> 6973.67
further smaller can actually be a lot

6971.719 --> 6975.65
more efficient depending on the convoy

6973.67 --> 6977.269
destroyed small that's fine to be you

6975.65 --> 6979.07
can ask more well you don't need a big

6977.269 --> 6982.249
one small one it's fine all you need to

6979.07 --> 6984.349
have is that is a is a camera you know

6982.249 --> 6986.449
that you can see no not just gave orders

6984.349 --> 6989.84
okay you need all kinds of centuries

6986.449 --> 6992.719
camera is of course prime but also you

6989.84 --> 6995.42
know century or together you're looking

6992.719 --> 7000.34
at temperature pressure humidity all

6995.42 --> 7002.4400000000005
that it's very useful I did read before

7000.34 --> 7006.28
that the Japanese built the hydrogen

7002.44 --> 7008.619
power basically water powers a vehicle a

7006.28 --> 7011.05
long long time ago back back before

7008.619 --> 7015.07
Kinnear there they they had looked into

7011.05 --> 7017.38
that successfully you know back before

7015.07 --> 7019.66
well they were gonna acid buses here in

7017.38 --> 7021.37
the Netherlands to that but it only

7019.66 --> 7024.099999999999
stuck to a certain region

7021.37 --> 7029.43
so yeah the hydrogen technology has been

7024.1 --> 7034.21
around for a long time it doesn't freeze

7029.43 --> 7036.34
so yeah you're going you're gonna keep

7034.21 --> 7037.81
on it's gonna keep on being there if you

7036.34 --> 7039.82
could somehow take that in from the

7037.81 --> 7042.25
atmosphere because it is raising all the

7039.82 --> 7043.87
time so if you could somehow take that

7042.25 --> 7044.64
in from the atmosphere hike in a very

7043.87 --> 7047.38
simple way

7044.64 --> 7050.47
well now that's useless no no no the

7047.38 --> 7051.46
hydrogen is so easy to make you just

7050.47 --> 7054.1900000000005
need water

7051.46 --> 7054.58
okay we're for a place where there is an

7054.19 --> 7056.349999999999
era

7054.58 --> 7057.7
even in the desert there is water you

7056.35 --> 7060.04
can collect it from the air it's just

7057.7 --> 7062.7699999999995
dissolved into it take a scoop of ice

7060.04 --> 7065.47
you split it up using electrolysis

7062.77 --> 7069.01
there's even systems that just directly

7065.47 --> 7072.240000000001
work on water by creating by splitting

7069.01 --> 7075.22
the water up into oxygen and hydrogen

7072.24 --> 7082.12
and then using it instantaneously

7075.22 --> 7083.68
without even storing it so the moisture

7082.12 --> 7086.38
that's in the atmosphere if you could

7083.68 --> 7088.360000000001
take that in the comparators within in a

7086.38 --> 7089.83
simple way conservative within the drone

7088.36 --> 7091.8099999999995
the drone will keep going

7089.83 --> 7095.59
no what are they they wanted to be the

7091.81 --> 7098.29
owners or not like whatever well whoever

7095.59 --> 7102.22
then whoever is the boss of bosses of

7098.29 --> 7103.48
Antarctica and over if you had a small

7102.22 --> 7105.400000000001
one and you can do that

7103.48 --> 7109.24
hey you might get past a lot of there

7105.4 --> 7112.66
okay you might get a past a lot of voice

7109.24 --> 7114.3099999999995
not going away and if because the main

7112.66 --> 7116.47
problem think the reason people haven't

7114.31 --> 7119.410000000001
explored Antarctica for garrulous more

7116.47 --> 7121.6900000000005
people believe it is is down to it's not

7119.41 --> 7123.49
just the dangerous it's not a few you

7121.69 --> 7126.099999999999
know it's down to fuel everything's that

7123.49 --> 7127.51
works on petrol and diesel your

7126.1 --> 7129.25
everything still working on those kind

7127.51 --> 7132.34
of things so it can only go so far with

7129.25 --> 7135.79
it yeah yeah power engines are not

7132.34 --> 7139.54
suitable for for low temperatures it's a

7135.79 --> 7141.37
known problem no known problem you can

7139.54 --> 7143.62
only go so far with that going a few you

7141.37 --> 7145.599999999999
can't go like that's the here very like

7143.62 --> 7147.07
you get in your car you fill it up just

7145.6 --> 7150.070000000001
a car alone

7147.07 --> 7151.449
and you'll only go let's say 500 miles

7150.07 --> 7154.0
or whatever it is whatever your tank

7151.449 --> 7156.82
know what that's it don't wanna mean

7154.0 --> 7158.56
it's like he won't go forward now so as

7156.82 --> 7160.389
long as we always had that kinda fuel

7158.56 --> 7162.909000000001
we'll never be able to actually explore

7160.389 --> 7164.889
because we're going to be always going

7162.909 --> 7167.79
to be stuck now I don't know but come on

7164.889 --> 7171.1900000000005
that that's not an issue at all

7167.79 --> 7174.099
whew it's just a few is just a catalyzer

7171.19 --> 7175.9
for the common world if they're gonna

7174.099 --> 7178.900000000001
explore and are today I'm gonna use

7175.9 --> 7180.579
petrol fuels the nonsense no but that's

7178.9 --> 7185.17
what I'm saying as long as we had them

7180.579 --> 7187.96
we won't be able you can go but you

7185.17 --> 7189.9400000000005
don't need to you don't need to

7187.96 --> 7193.329
there's just hydrogen engines

7189.94 --> 7194.799999999999
industrially usable out there there's

7193.329 --> 7197.38
people that have been tinkering with

7194.8 --> 7199.75
that stuff forever so you don't need to

7197.38 --> 7202.0
assume that we're we're only allowed to

7199.75 --> 7205.51
use regular fuel engines is just not

7202.0 --> 7207.31
true it's it's not so much that we're

7205.51 --> 7209.8
only allowed to use regular fuel engines

7207.31 --> 7213.4890000000005
I'm not saying that what I'm saying is

7209.8 --> 7216.79
that in the mainstream that is the main

7213.489 --> 7220.598999999999
fuel so if you wanted to somehow send a

7216.79 --> 7222.04
drone that could or saw or somehow call

7220.599 --> 7224.02
yourself in a vehicles

7222.04 --> 7226.21
keep the gold or in some kind of flaw in

7224.02 --> 7228.67
it by choice or whatever the main

7226.21 --> 7230.679
problem that people have is distance

7228.67 --> 7233.9490000000005
because if you know even in an even in

7230.679 --> 7236.2300000000005
like a general and an airliner like the

7233.949 --> 7238.69
biggest airliners like they can still

7236.23 --> 7240.79
only go a certain distance and they

7238.69 --> 7243.07
located there is very long horse lights

7240.79 --> 7245.29
but there's still a limit to how far

7243.07 --> 7248.17
they can go and wherever they go you

7245.29 --> 7251.29
have to get fuel and really get back you

7248.17 --> 7253.179
know it's like if your bullet it's not

7251.29 --> 7256.06
just saying that's the main reason that

7253.179 --> 7259.719
people have to do it that's only if you

7256.06 --> 7261.4890000000005
don't know proper exploration if you're

7259.719 --> 7262.9890000000005
just gonna take a look yeah that's an

7261.489 --> 7264.94
issue but if you're gonna plan deep

7262.989 --> 7268.54
exploration you're gonna have to have a

7264.94 --> 7271.299999999999
plan for that of course yeah and I've

7268.54 --> 7272.86
already made plans about that kind of

7271.3 --> 7275.88
thing even in the open and it's very

7272.86 --> 7281.44
obvious that yeah you need some kind of

7275.88 --> 7285.43
way to locally gather new fuel

7281.44 --> 7288.699
that's doable yeah well that's why I

7285.43 --> 7290.35
mentioned idea the moisture yes because

7288.699 --> 7293.11
if you could somehow take the hydrogen

7290.35 --> 7295.4800000000005
era in some simpler way then your drone

7293.11 --> 7298.15
won't stop you know me you can keep it

7295.48 --> 7300.4
go on I the only Pablo IP might be the

7298.15 --> 7304.03
rotors or overheating maybe of it or

7300.4 --> 7305.949
something in some way but it's not going

7304.03 --> 7309.13
to turn out in a problem because there's

7305.949 --> 7309.669999999999
plenty a cold present cool it that's

7309.13 --> 7311.5
true

7309.67 --> 7313.42
are we and again you don't know where

7311.5 --> 7313.87
you're going you don't know what I mean

7313.42 --> 7316.21
it that way

7313.87 --> 7318.58
like you don't all see do eventually if

7316.21 --> 7322.63
you know it's cold now but if you go

7318.58 --> 7325.12
fast they are all right but if look if a

7322.63 --> 7327.52
drone designed to explore is gonna turn

7325.12 --> 7330.58
up in non-frozen land with forests and

7327.52 --> 7333.46
[ __ ] it's safe to say that at that point

7330.58 --> 7335.83
you don't necessarily need to explore

7333.46 --> 7338.43
beyond that it might be a good time to

7335.83 --> 7338.43
look around

7338.73 --> 7344.049999999999
I'd be looking at that kind of the side

7341.41 --> 7346.18
of it all of the the rotaries and that

7344.05 --> 7348.34
honest it's like all the powers the

7346.18 --> 7349.6
fears all these kind of things how long

7348.34 --> 7350.89
will they last because your boy have

7349.6 --> 7353.8
fueled that well out there

7350.89 --> 7356.320000000001
yeah well there's look we can discuss

7353.8 --> 7358.9890000000005
this for hours and hours and hours right

7356.32 --> 7361.989
about the design details it's all

7358.989 --> 7365.5
accountable for it's not that hard it's

7361.989 --> 7367.75
a lot of work well I'm gonna yeah but

7365.5 --> 7371.23
I'm gonna round out the show now so I

7367.75 --> 7373.239
need to take it toilet break so thank

7371.23 --> 7378.73
you for me it was a good discussion very

7373.239 --> 7381.87
long but it's good come back a day yeah

7378.73 --> 7386.37
it was a pleasure to have you Brian

7381.87 --> 7386.37
all right let's go figure

7386.94 --> 7394.9
all right so yeah thanks everyone for

7390.64 --> 7396.1900000000005
coming was a two-hour show was good if

7394.9 --> 7398.469
you like the video please don't forget

7396.19 --> 7400.239
to upload it and if you haven't already

7398.469 --> 7401.949
subscribed to my channel hit the bell

7400.239 --> 7403.69
notification so you know when I'm going

7401.949 --> 7406.419999999999
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

7403.69 --> 7408.12
Amsterdam time also please support my

7406.42 --> 7412.12
channel through super chats

7408.12 --> 7415.12
PayPal would be best even patreon and my

7412.12 --> 7418.8099999999995
GoFundMe so I will be back tomorrow with

7415.12 --> 7420.88
early-bird number 216 i'm also going to

7418.81 --> 7422.89
be on ball busters oh no what not well

7420.88 --> 7426.76
I'm gonna have an a night owl show

7422.89 --> 7431.35
tonight and hashtag meifa until the next

7426.76 --> 7461.39
Flat Earth video keep it flat
