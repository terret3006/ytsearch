like 20 euros but still thank you

135.28 --> 139.36
patreon supporters

136.879 --> 141.2
i often overlook you

139.36 --> 142.87900000000002
but i really appreciate it and some of

141.2 --> 145.44
you have been my longest standing

142.879 --> 145.44
supporters

145.84 --> 150.56
thank you very much

147.28 --> 150.56
anyway the weather

152.08 --> 155.08
is

158.8 --> 163.68
kind of beautiful

161.2 --> 167.959
still some big clouds

163.68 --> 167.959
but also some blue sky

170.48 --> 174.959
sometimes wind sometimes it's going to

172.56 --> 178.4
wind still

174.959 --> 180.8
it's overall a pretty nice summer day

178.4 --> 182.72
i haven't seen any trails being left

180.8 --> 184.8
although there's this weird haze hanging

182.72 --> 187.12
up there but that could just be natural

184.8 --> 187.12
form

187.519 --> 191.519
doesn't seem like any

190.4 --> 195.08
trail

191.519 --> 195.08
feathers typically

205.68 --> 211.36
it looks pretty beautiful

208.879 --> 211.35999999999999
doesn't it

211.519 --> 214.159
anyhow

225.599 --> 230.959
hello jarvis first in chat

227.84 --> 234.0
mike seduc good to see you tara 306

230.959 --> 234.0
steamy traveler

234.319 --> 236.64
yeah

236.72 --> 241.68
good to have you here in chat

238.799 --> 242.799
it is saturday the 6th

241.68 --> 246.59900000000002
of

242.799 --> 246.59900000000002
august 2022.

250.4 --> 254.959
oh my yeah i'm doing i'm doing okay i

252.799 --> 258.23900000000003
had a really late night though

254.959 --> 261.919
it's very restless yesterday was

258.239 --> 261.919
a bit of a weird fed

262.32 --> 266.639
it was one of those rowdy days but this

264.88 --> 269.44
time i wasn't

266.639 --> 270.32
i wasn't like that

269.44 --> 271.44
but i

270.32 --> 272.8
was still

271.44 --> 275.28
i don't know

272.8 --> 277.52000000000004
i i really got on people's nerves

275.28 --> 279.35999999999996
somehow apparently

277.52 --> 282.71999999999997
or they were all thinking back to those

279.36 --> 286.96000000000004
times when i was like like very

282.72 --> 286.96000000000004
oversensitive but it wasn't at all

287.12 --> 292.8
this time actually was brian's logic

290.4 --> 294.79999999999995
he went kind of berserk on me

292.8 --> 297.28000000000003
like never heard him talk like that

294.8 --> 299.84000000000003
before it was really bizarre

297.28 --> 302.55999999999995
he felt so betrayed and dramatic and i

299.84 --> 303.84
was like i'm i'm just trying to point

302.56 --> 308.0
out a

303.84 --> 310.71999999999997
semantic detail that really does matter

308.0 --> 313.52
and it's like oh but you don't

310.72 --> 315.199
understand no i absolutely understand

313.52 --> 319.35999999999996
what you're doing what you're trying to

315.199 --> 319.36
do and i get it and it just wouldn't

320.0 --> 324.4
afterward he even like apologized to

322.0 --> 326.639
everybody except me

324.4 --> 329.59999999999997
i was like okay fine whatever man it's

326.639 --> 329.6
your freaking life

329.68 --> 333.12
weird

331.759 --> 335.12
other than that it was a really

333.12 --> 338.28000000000003
interesting show pretty long after show

335.12 --> 338.28000000000003
as well

338.4 --> 344.08
i i mean i didn't let it get to me i

340.4 --> 344.08
felt really strong yesterday so

347.68 --> 351.40000000000003
hello someone

355.36 --> 357.68
huh

360.96 --> 366.28
but you're not actually a soccer account

363.28 --> 366.28
huh

367.199 --> 375.40000000000003
welcome to the early bird chat

370.72 --> 375.40000000000003
oh raised by gypsies good to see you

380.24 --> 385.12
yeah steamy traveler

382.319 --> 386.319
yeah jim bob i watched jim bob live

385.12 --> 388.479
yesterday

386.319 --> 390.72
and he brought up the the whole salami

388.479 --> 392.88
or the chorizo picture

390.72 --> 395.68
he called it a salami i was the one to

392.88 --> 398.15999999999997
actually call it a chorizo like no i

395.68 --> 401.759
recognize that sausage

398.16 --> 401.759
it's a very specific type

403.759 --> 407.44
it's pig meat

406.0 --> 410.319
garlic

407.44 --> 412.319
and red pepper i recognize that and the

410.319 --> 414.319
way the shape is i recognize that

412.319 --> 416.96000000000004
anywhere

414.319 --> 416.96000000000004
but yeah

417.84 --> 423.84
the space telescope image was a slice of

420.16 --> 423.84000000000003
chorizo that's right

443.199 --> 448.47
hey price of atom

445.25 --> 448.47
[Music]

450.24 --> 454.319
so yeah yesterday overall pretty

452.08 --> 456.24
interesting exciting day

454.319 --> 460.24
everybody was pretty high energy

456.24 --> 463.52
[Music]

460.24 --> 466.8
and by the way so was owen benjamin

463.52 --> 469.28
i did i watched like uh 30 minutes of a

466.8 --> 472.16
show from yesterday and he was all into

469.28 --> 473.35999999999996
diving into this fractal thinking

472.16 --> 475.36
pattern

473.36 --> 478.16
just really it's an interesting way of

475.36 --> 481.28000000000003
explaining it

478.16 --> 484.08000000000004
it really cross-connects the actual

481.28 --> 486.87899999999996
fractal system like as in mathematical

484.08 --> 488.71999999999997
based fractals

486.879 --> 489.84000000000003
like visual fractals

488.72 --> 491.12
with

489.84 --> 494.479
like

491.12 --> 496.72
social psychological positioning

494.479 --> 499.28
and that is how it works right it is

496.72 --> 503.199
like the spirit

499.28 --> 504.15999999999997
there is like a sort of a collective

503.199 --> 505.84000000000003
spirit

504.16 --> 507.759
system

505.84 --> 509.52
so if you attune to a frequency you're

507.759 --> 510.879
going to behave in accordance to that

509.52 --> 513.919
frequency

510.879 --> 516.8000000000001
the patterns are quite specific

513.919 --> 518.3199999999999
and even if you have not if you're not

516.8 --> 520.8
aware of

518.32 --> 523.7600000000001
what is part of that

520.8 --> 526.56
which by just being in that frequency

523.76 --> 528.56
the patterns will start to manifest and

526.56 --> 529.68
that is something that i don't know own

528.56 --> 532.16
benjamin seemed to have really

529.68 --> 533.3599999999999
highlighted yesterday his first part of

532.16 --> 536.8
the show

533.36 --> 539.04
and he's totally on target with that

536.8 --> 541.68
and that is a very interesting way to

539.04 --> 541.68
connect it

544.0 --> 548.48
i basically just tried to say about it

546.56 --> 551.68
like no it's just like

548.48 --> 551.6800000000001
spirit communism

551.839 --> 557.24
and now i

553.68 --> 557.2399999999999
explain again

562.16 --> 567.519
psychosocial positioning and

565.2 --> 569.6
frequency attunement

567.519 --> 572.24
and then with the specific frequency

569.6 --> 574.08
because come specific patterns and if a

572.24 --> 576.24
lot of people attune to that specific

574.08 --> 578.08
frequency they will all manifest those

576.24 --> 580.5600000000001
patterns and then they will have a

578.08 --> 583.36
naturally born through the spirit

580.56 --> 584.399
collective with each other

583.36 --> 587.12
it's not

584.399 --> 588.959
something that anybody rules over

587.12 --> 591.12
because if somebody tries to rule over

588.959 --> 592.399
it they step outside

591.12 --> 594.48
and then they

592.399 --> 596.56
go away from the weakened frequency so

594.48 --> 599.6
it doesn't work anymore you can't really

596.56 --> 602.399
rule over it it just happens

599.6 --> 606.0
it's really interesting and although to

602.399 --> 608.48
say like oh this is how the elites are

606.0 --> 610.399
conspiring against us and to say none of

608.48 --> 612.72
them are in on it

610.399 --> 615.12
that's not true

612.72 --> 616.72
that's not true though

615.12 --> 620.24
because there is

616.72 --> 622.0
plans being written down organized

620.24 --> 623.76
now you could say that those plans are

622.0 --> 628.48
being written

623.76 --> 630.3199999999999
by scribes that are merely trying to

628.48 --> 632.399
write down

630.32 --> 635.12
the patterns that come with that

632.399 --> 636.959
frequency

635.12 --> 640.48
they're literally like scribes they're

636.959 --> 641.92
like divining exactly like how to do it

640.48 --> 643.839
and it works

641.92 --> 647.36
it works on that frequency it's terrible

643.839 --> 649.2790000000001
it's evil but it works

647.36 --> 651.36
in that specific

649.279 --> 653.6
way

651.36 --> 657.6
that doesn't mean that it's like the

653.6 --> 660.48
ultimate plan to overcome though

657.6 --> 663.279
anyway it's yeah it's interesting really

660.48 --> 663.279
did make me think

665.92 --> 670.16
so much is still left undiscussed

673.48 --> 678.88
432 hearts okay

676.64 --> 679.92
i'm not talking about sound frequency in

678.88 --> 682.72
this

679.92 --> 685.36
in this case someone i'm talking about

682.72 --> 686.72
spirit frequency where you're at with

685.36 --> 688.32
your spirit

686.72 --> 689.76
and your consciousness right where your

688.32 --> 692.399
consciousness dwells is where your

689.76 --> 692.399
spirit's at

698.24 --> 703.279
well george sanford

700.64 --> 707.16
when time slows down

703.279 --> 707.16
what are you talking about

732.88 --> 737.6
yeah hello someone yeah i thought you

735.44 --> 741.36
were a stock account yeah because you

737.6 --> 743.36
literally call yourself someone

741.36 --> 745.12
that's

743.36 --> 747.279
that feels to me like

745.12 --> 749.04
a troll name

747.279 --> 751.2
but yeah i

749.04 --> 754.24
since you didn't say anything malevolent

751.2 --> 756.1600000000001
i checked your account

754.24 --> 758.399
and you do actually have subscribers and

756.16 --> 760.0
stuff so i knew like oh you're actually

758.399 --> 761.36
a real person

760.0 --> 763.44
but yeah

761.36 --> 767.44
with the name like that you can be

763.44 --> 767.44
easily mistaken for a sock troll

767.519 --> 774.0
but that's alright welcome to the show

771.44 --> 775.0400000000001
you're all somewhat yes

774.0 --> 778.279
that's

775.04 --> 778.279
not helping

792.079 --> 796.519
what are you talking about george

793.519 --> 796.519
sanford

809.92 --> 815.1999999999999
that makes no sense i mean time is a

812.48 --> 816.24
concept it's a derived

815.2 --> 819.6800000000001
system

816.24 --> 819.6800000000001
it cannot slow down

820.88 --> 824.8
i mean

822.079 --> 826.8389999999999
the consistency of entropy within nature

824.8 --> 828.639
is not going to be

826.839 --> 830.1600000000001
altered

828.639 --> 833.04
okay

830.16 --> 833.04
that doesn't work

833.519 --> 837.92
you have no idea what that'll do that'll

835.36 --> 839.6800000000001
literally disrupt the very fabric of

837.92 --> 841.8389999999999
functioning of life and everything is

839.68 --> 844.56
you can't do that god cannot do that it

841.839 --> 844.5600000000001
cannot be done

845.44 --> 848.5600000000001
what could be done

847.6 --> 849.9200000000001
is

848.56 --> 853.04
somehow

849.92 --> 855.199
it virtually i can imagine this and

853.04 --> 857.04
cannot find something like super

855.199 --> 859.279
egregious that would make it physically

857.04 --> 861.68
impossible no matter what

859.279 --> 863.76
what could happen in order for us to

861.68 --> 865.279
experience time slower is that our

863.76 --> 867.519
consciousness

865.279 --> 869.8389999999999
which isn't material

867.519 --> 873.76
right it is

869.839 --> 875.44
effect outside of the material from god

873.76 --> 878.079
it might be

875.44 --> 878.0790000000001
sped up

878.16 --> 881.36
and they will be weird by the way

879.6 --> 884.399
because our bodies are not going to

881.36 --> 888.5600000000001
speed up but our spirit might

884.399 --> 890.88
and then we might experience time slower

888.56 --> 892.6389999999999
but that's really only the consciousness

890.88 --> 894.72
then it's probably going to be very

892.639 --> 896.72
tiresome to do that

894.72 --> 898.88
because

896.72 --> 901.6
like consciousness activity is basically

898.88 --> 904.16
spirit energy activity it's still gonna

901.6 --> 905.6800000000001
detract from the body

904.16 --> 907.8389999999999
it's gonna feed the body and also

905.68 --> 909.5999999999999
detract from the body if that hurries up

907.839 --> 911.519
a lot then you're it's gonna be

909.6 --> 913.839
literally draining it is like being

911.519 --> 915.76
extremely hyperactive costs a lot of

913.839 --> 919.2790000000001
energy

915.76 --> 920.079
brain burns up energy too

919.279 --> 922.8
so

920.079 --> 926.88
that could maybe happen other than that

922.8 --> 930.3199999999999
i have absolutely no idea

926.88 --> 933.5889999999999
what you're talking about george sanford

930.32 --> 933.589
[Music]

942.16 --> 948.8389999999999
i thought you're too slow no

944.639 --> 948.839
it's all nasa stories

972.56 --> 976.7199999999999
says it's speeding up

974.16 --> 978.8
so something speeding up slowing down i

976.72 --> 981.1990000000001
don't care i don't really care what they

978.8 --> 983.68
say jarvis it's all garbage it's all

981.199 --> 986.88
just oh look at this oh look at the

983.68 --> 989.519
look at my keys go look at the keys

used to think oh they're actually

covering up

that's esoteric

1158.32 --> 1164.08
if you know it's all lies

1161.28 --> 1166.559
then why would you even start to think

1164.08 --> 1169.559
that maybe it's a cover-up for something

it doesn't change it doesn't go faster

1286.08 --> 1291.52
it's exactly the way it is and it always

[Music]

1318.24 --> 1323.679
what's my belief on what lies past the

1321.36 --> 1325.84
arctic walls

1323.679 --> 1328.4
well i don't even know how consistent

1325.84 --> 1330.48
the arctic walls are

1328.4 --> 1334.96
i have a strong suspicion that there is

1330.48 --> 1334.96
a realm north and south

1335.2 --> 1338.0800000000002
beyond our own

1338.24 --> 1341.44
is

1339.12 --> 1344.559
it seems logical that there would

1341.44 --> 1346.48
be only one south and one north but it

1344.559 --> 1348.799
could be more

1346.48 --> 1349.919
but they would be in a chain link to one

1348.799 --> 1353.039
another

1349.919 --> 1358.0800000000002
it's definitely not puddles because

1353.039 --> 1358.08
the realm is not an endless flat plane

1358.88 --> 1363.3600000000001
with like little circles carved out of

1361.679 --> 1368.2
it by a sun

1363.36 --> 1368.1999999999998
that's not how this works at all

1382.32 --> 1386.24
i've talked about it many times someone

1384.32 --> 1389.9189999999999
i know you're probably yeah you said you

1386.24 --> 1393.2
were pretty new but i have like

1389.919 --> 1395.039
yeah standing hangouts from

1393.2 --> 1399.28
four years ago

1395.039 --> 1401.44
where i explained it it's concerning the

1399.28 --> 1404.72
the layout of earth

1401.44 --> 1404.72
rectangular looping

1408.24 --> 1412.799
and i've reasons to suspect there is a

1410.64 --> 1414.3200000000002
looping nature to the confine of the

1412.799 --> 1417.12
realm

1414.32 --> 1419.039
and that there is not any kind of

1417.12 --> 1422.9599999999998
infinity

1419.039 --> 1422.96
within physical space

1423.919 --> 1427.919
it's not any horizontal plane that's

1426.32 --> 1430.6399999999999
infinite is no

1427.919 --> 1432.0
infinite room surrounding us above us or

1430.64 --> 1434.0800000000002
anywhere

1432.0 --> 1436.32
the volume has to be

1434.08 --> 1437.84
of a limitation

1436.32 --> 1440.1589999999999
now how

1437.84 --> 1442.9599999999998
like the numerical value that could be

1440.159 --> 1445.679
attributed to that limitation

1442.96 --> 1450.32
i cannot say and maybe

1445.679 --> 1452.799
who knows who knows man god could like

1450.32 --> 1455.279
expand on that maybe even

1452.799 --> 1456.1589999999999
but it can never

1455.279 --> 1457.76
ever

1456.159 --> 1463.0390000000002
be infinite

1457.76 --> 1464.559
not even god the designer could do that

1463.039 --> 1466.8799999999999
you'd like to think that he could but

1464.559 --> 1467.84
that's only because you're weakened by

1466.88 --> 1469.919
your own

1467.84 --> 1472.3999999999999
limited imagination

1469.919 --> 1475.679
yeah your limited imagination that tells

1472.4 --> 1476.88
you oh infinity is just yeah of course

1475.679 --> 1479.6000000000001
infinity

1476.88 --> 1482.3200000000002
infinity is a concept that comes natural

1479.6 --> 1484.559
to when you're a little kid even

1482.32 --> 1488.24
because there's so much that you have no

1484.559 --> 1490.32
grip on so you just think it's endless

1488.24 --> 1493.36
it is basically a form of physicality

1490.32 --> 1495.76
assumption bias or adjacent to that

1493.36 --> 1496.7199999999998
to believe that there is infinity of any

1495.76 --> 1498.72
sort

1496.72 --> 1502.0
it's always a child's dream because in

1498.72 --> 1504.48
reality there isn't there is a finite

1502.0 --> 1506.72
affinity

1504.48 --> 1509.84

1638.0 --> 1641.2
it's

1638.72 --> 1643.52
they probably figured out for some

the year

what we thought the total preponderance

1656.799 --> 1663.12
it's a millisecond right something like

2005.919 --> 2009.76
hard to keep track of these new yeah

2007.36 --> 2012.8799999999999
because it's [ __ ] there it

2009.76 --> 2014.64
there are no viruses viruses don't exist

2012.88 --> 2016.24
they're a science fiction concept that

2014.64 --> 2018.3200000000002
was never proven

2016.24 --> 2020.72
as being highly abused as a

2018.32 --> 2022.0
psychological model

2020.72 --> 2027.1200000000001
to keep

2022.0 --> 2031.08
people bound to the necromancy guild

2027.12 --> 2031.08
we know as modern medicine

2036.72 --> 2041.6000000000001
see kind of angry today oh really no i'm

2038.96 --> 2044.24
not angry today

2041.6 --> 2046.48
but if i like make an item

2044.24 --> 2048.879
an item and tell people

2046.48 --> 2051.28
stop talking about this stop talking

2048.879 --> 2053.7599999999998
about this and i'm doing that for like

2051.28 --> 2057.28
five minutes straight and then they

2053.76 --> 2058.079
still [ __ ] do it yeah i get pissed

2057.28 --> 2060.639
then

2058.079 --> 2063.04
i get pissed off

2060.639 --> 2066.96
has nothing to do with me being kind of

2063.04 --> 2069.04
angry it's me getting pissed off because

2066.96 --> 2071.359
people are squibbling

2069.04 --> 2073.679
yeah whatever

2071.359 --> 2076.639
they're acting like [ __ ] idiots and

2073.679 --> 2076.639
they're not listening

2077.28 --> 2081.3590000000004
that pisses me off

2079.44 --> 2084.359
nothing to do with whether i'm angry or

2081.359 --> 2084.359
not

2087.699 --> 2090.909
[Music]

2095.119 --> 2099.44
squabbling i don't even know if that's a

2097.119 --> 2099.44
word

2099.76 --> 2103.5600000000004
it probably is

2109.76 --> 2115.8390000000004
but overall i'm doing great

2113.28 --> 2119.6800000000003
i am feeling pretty strong even though i

2115.839 --> 2119.68
went to bed like insanely late

2119.92 --> 2125.44
i feel strong

2122.4 --> 2126.88
but yeah financial man like i really

2125.44 --> 2129.76
need donations

2126.88 --> 2131.92
i mean i got 20 bucks from patreon

2129.76 --> 2133.5200000000004
that's cute

2131.92 --> 2136.079
that's not going to help me last the

2133.52 --> 2136.079
next week

2136.8 --> 2140.6400000000003
also i'm just

2138.64 --> 2143.2799999999997
like so bummed out

2140.64 --> 2145.359
that jado's transfer is just not coming

2143.28 --> 2147.28
through because that would fix

2145.359 --> 2148.88
everything and it's just not happening

2147.28 --> 2150.8
like this could

2148.88 --> 2154.7200000000003
it could turn out to just be like

2150.8 --> 2158.2400000000002
returned to him like oh oh it can't work

2154.72 --> 2160.16
and i it's so disappointing

2158.24 --> 2163.359
i could really use

2160.16 --> 2166.3199999999997
that kind of money right now

2163.359 --> 2167.7599999999998
i got another bill that's just whining

2166.32 --> 2170.1600000000003
then that

2167.76 --> 2173.44
yeah it's gonna basically

2170.16 --> 2176.0789999999997
give me like a 40 euro fine

2173.44 --> 2178.32
if i don't pay it soon and i absolutely

2176.079 --> 2180.96
don't have the money to pay it

2178.32 --> 2185.32
it's really annoying that is a no maybe

2180.96 --> 2185.32
i'm a little pissed off because of that

2188.48 --> 2191.76
other than that i'm doing great

2192.16 --> 2196.56
okay so i was actually right with the

2194.079 --> 2199.28
word squabbling that's amazing

2196.56 --> 2202.96
sometimes i use words and i don't even

2199.28 --> 2205.0400000000004
realize how precisely i am using them

2202.96 --> 2207.839
that's literally like my consciousness

2205.04 --> 2211.04
is like following after my words

2207.839 --> 2212.64
sometimes it's really true

2211.04 --> 2215.599
and it is

2212.64 --> 2217.44
pretty cool it's cool to do that

2215.599 --> 2219.28
although it makes me feel a little

2217.44 --> 2221.76
disoriented every now and then because

2219.28 --> 2223.6800000000003
sometimes i'm like what did i just say

2221.76 --> 2227.2000000000003
and i'm looking it up and i'm like wow

2223.68 --> 2227.2
that's exactly what i meant

2227.44 --> 2231.359
that so

2228.96 --> 2231.359
weird

2235.04 --> 2238.72
like how did i even know that i had to

2237.44 --> 2240.96
look it up

2238.72 --> 2243.04
and then it meant exactly what i wanted

2240.96 --> 2244.2400000000002
it to mean

2243.04 --> 2245.44
it's just

2244.24 --> 2245.83
yeah

2245.44 --> 2248.48
weird

2245.83 --> 2250.0789999999997
[Music]

2248.48 --> 2251.599
i guess a lot of

2250.079 --> 2254.079
language just goes through my

2251.599 --> 2256.88
subconscious

2254.079 --> 2260.32
i'd be a great linguist yeah

2256.88 --> 2260.32
i'd be decent enough

2261.68 --> 2265.9199999999996
i mean i can always be busy with it

2264.72 --> 2268.48
right

2265.92 --> 2270.4
it's a primary training i pretty much

2268.48 --> 2273.92
had at home

2270.4 --> 2276.48
it's always about language always always

2273.92 --> 2278.56
dutch language english language

2276.48 --> 2281.44
always looking things up in dictionaries

2278.56 --> 2283.7599999999998
etymology books everything

2281.44 --> 2286.48
encyclopedias

2283.76 --> 2288.2400000000002
talking about it

2286.48 --> 2291.2400000000002
with the family

2288.24 --> 2291.24
anyway

2303.359 --> 2306.48
ah that's a very wise decision there

2305.359 --> 2308.96
somewhere

2306.48 --> 2308.96
someone

2309.04 --> 2317.599
yeah don't ever take the shot it is

2313.359 --> 2317.5989999999997
it's worse than you could imagine

2317.839 --> 2321.599
i think that

2320.079 --> 2324.7200000000003
over

2321.599 --> 2326.96
in australia they're probably it's

2324.72 --> 2330.0
it's just worse there whatever they're

2326.96 --> 2332.56
because they are like literally

2330.0 --> 2336.32
trying to pull a full-on autocratic

2332.56 --> 2338.48
takeover worse than everywhere else

2336.32 --> 2341.28
so i wouldn't be surprised if they like

2338.48 --> 2343.44
had their own special tweaked shots with

2341.28 --> 2346.48
maybe like freaking mind control chips

2343.44 --> 2347.92
in them i'm not even joking i mean

2346.48 --> 2349.68
those things

2347.92 --> 2352.96
could be

2349.68 --> 2352.96
they could just do that

2353.359 --> 2357.7599999999998
they seem to be just doing whatever the

2355.76 --> 2360.8
[ __ ] they want there

2357.76 --> 2360.8
or to any level

2361.28 --> 2368.44
surprised that they haven't just started

2363.839 --> 2368.44
executing people in the streets yet

2376.64 --> 2381.7999999999997
steam traveler what you watch that

2382.32 --> 2386.96
it was in the after show

2384.079 --> 2390.48
it was just the stupid nitpick i did

2386.96 --> 2392.88
i didn't have a beef

2390.48 --> 2395.119
brian seemed to have a giant beef with

2392.88 --> 2397.76
me i didn't have a beef with him i was

2395.119 --> 2400.7200000000003
just trying to correct him on a certain

2397.76 --> 2404.7200000000003
description that he used when he said

2400.72 --> 2407.04
like the only real horizon

2404.72 --> 2408.319
that can never be refracted and it was

2407.04 --> 2410.319
just like

2408.319 --> 2412.4
that's the worst way you could say what

2410.319 --> 2414.4
you're trying to say right now

2412.4 --> 2418.2400000000002
and he wasn't he was really getting

2414.4 --> 2420.2400000000002
pissed off because i tried to correct it

2418.24 --> 2422.64
so eventually

2420.24 --> 2425.359
i just said okay i'm done i'm not gonna

2422.64 --> 2426.48
discuss i'm not gonna talk with you any

2425.359 --> 2428.48
further

2426.48 --> 2429.68
and i didn't i haven't talked with him

2428.48 --> 2432.64
any further

2429.68 --> 2434.0789999999997
because he was just acting like a raging

2432.64 --> 2439.44
teenager

2434.079 --> 2441.3590000000004
like and yeah i'm not your dad boy

2439.44 --> 2442.7200000000003
i'm not actually going to continue a

2441.359 --> 2444.319
conversation with you if you're going to

2442.72 --> 2448.04
act like that

2444.319 --> 2448.04
and i will remember

2453.599 --> 2460.079
always great to have everybody else

2456.16 --> 2463.44
whining and complaining to me afterward

2460.079 --> 2465.52
about it too how i did it wrong even

2463.44 --> 2469.76
though brian was literally foaming at

2465.52 --> 2470.72
the mouth screaming at me yeah

2469.76 --> 2472.3190000000004
zero

2470.72 --> 2476.48
zero remarks

2472.319 --> 2479.839
no no only when arwyn gets angry now

2476.48 --> 2483.119
that's when oh now i went back

2479.839 --> 2485.599
somebody else could get [ __ ] a mental

2483.119 --> 2488.48
oh he's not gonna have a talking to

2485.599 --> 2491.28
no you're gonna move around that no

2488.48 --> 2493.76
you're gonna go after arwen again

2491.28 --> 2494.96
because i made the other person the

2493.76 --> 2496.4
madman

2494.96 --> 2498.64
yes

2496.4 --> 2502.0
i'm i'm getting kind of sick of the

2498.64 --> 2505.359
group dynamic when they do that to me

2502.0 --> 2507.119
really i am getting kind of sick of it

2505.359 --> 2509.2
and i spoke out about it like i'm not

2507.119 --> 2511.839
gonna be treated like this i don't give

2509.2 --> 2515.1189999999997
a [ __ ] if you feel that this is okay

2511.839 --> 2517.52
right now it's not okay to me

2515.119 --> 2519.52
i will not be talked to like this you

2517.52 --> 2522.4
you can't stop talking to me like i'm a

2519.52 --> 2525.44
[ __ ] little child i'm not

2522.4 --> 2525.44
i know what i'm doing

2525.839 --> 2528.48
and

2527.04 --> 2529.7599999999998
i'm not going to be treated like if

2528.48 --> 2531.44
you're going to treat me like that i'll

2529.76 --> 2533.6800000000003
just go away then

2531.44 --> 2536.4
you can all go [ __ ] yourself i didn't

2533.68 --> 2539.5989999999997
say you can go go [ __ ] yourself but that

2536.4 --> 2539.599
was strongly implied

2540.96 --> 2545.2
oh and by the way nathan actually sided

2543.68 --> 2547.04
with me

2545.2 --> 2548.16
yeah he did

2547.04 --> 2550.56
so

2548.16 --> 2552.96
applause on that one

2550.56 --> 2555.359
because i was right

2552.96 --> 2558.4
at least he had still the common sense

2555.359 --> 2560.48
left common centuries left to actually

2558.4 --> 2563.44
pick up on that fact

2560.48 --> 2565.44
while brian was screaming at me and

2563.44 --> 2567.92
asking me a question and then when i

2565.44 --> 2570.64
answered started the rumpus

2567.92 --> 2573.44
10 seconds in a row starting half a

2570.64 --> 2574.96
second after i started my response to

2573.44 --> 2577.119
his question

2574.96 --> 2579.44
and then got angry afterward about it

2577.119 --> 2583.2000000000003
too i'm sorry brian you were [ __ ] out

2579.44 --> 2583.2000000000003
of your mind yesterday

2585.68 --> 2591.1189999999997
and it is not my freaking fault

2588.96 --> 2592.56
i i get a little pissed off too

2591.119 --> 2596.48
sometimes yeah

2592.56 --> 2600.64
i'm definitely gonna point at myself for

2596.48 --> 2600.64
being like that when i'm like that

2600.88 --> 2605.599
maybe you should learn to do that too

2603.68 --> 2608.3999999999996
it's better for your own health

2605.599 --> 2608.4
insanity

2608.91 --> 2612.06
[Music]

2617.68 --> 2622.72
i've often wondered if there is a

2619.52 --> 2623.68
horizon on the flat earth

2622.72 --> 2625.4399999999996
yeah

2623.68 --> 2628.16
the horizon

2625.44 --> 2632.319
there is only one horizon the one we see

2628.16 --> 2634.7999999999997
the apparent horizon which is kind of

2632.319 --> 2636.4
yeah it's just the horizon no horizon is

2634.8 --> 2638.8
apparent

2636.4 --> 2640.64
it is a visual side effect

2638.8 --> 2643.8390000000004
that makes

2640.64 --> 2644.8799999999997
the visuals merge in a very specific

2643.839 --> 2647.2799999999997
setup

2644.88 --> 2650.8
resulting in the horizon

2647.28 --> 2653.119
to the observer that's how you see it

2650.8 --> 2655.92
we see the horizon the way it is because

2653.119 --> 2657.6800000000003
the earth is flat

2655.92 --> 2661.04
i've often wondered

2657.68 --> 2663.68
if we like if the horizon would look the

2661.04 --> 2665.92
way it did on the ball

2663.68 --> 2668.96
no it wouldn't

2665.92 --> 2670.52
it would be geometric we'd get to see

2668.96 --> 2672.88
more sky

2670.52 --> 2675.04
percentage-wise in our entire field of

2672.88 --> 2678.4
view throughout our life

2675.04 --> 2680.0
on a ball we get more sky in our field

2678.4 --> 2682.1600000000003
of view on a ball

2680.0 --> 2684.0
more than we actually do because the

2682.16 --> 2686.8799999999997
earth is flat

2684.0 --> 2688.079
and the horizon is exactly halfway our

2686.88 --> 2691.359
vision

2688.079 --> 2694.48
which is a direct result

2691.359 --> 2696.319
of the earth being flat

2694.48 --> 2699.119
and then no matter your height it's

2696.319 --> 2700.24
always going to be exactly halfway 50

2699.119 --> 2702.839
50.

2700.24 --> 2706.24
50 50 horizon

2702.839 --> 2712.119
distribution of sky and earth in all

2706.24 --> 2712.1189999999997
visuals can only work on a flat earth

2755.76 --> 2758.76
hmm

2763.359 --> 2765.7599999999998
okay

2766.16 --> 2772.52
well there it maybe just follow him in

2768.88 --> 2772.52
live chat then

2798.24 --> 2801.2
right you're a member over at nathan

2799.92 --> 2802.96

2844.88 --> 2852.2400000000002
what no youtube's a platform

2848.72 --> 2852.24
does that have to do with nasa

2852.559 --> 2856.2400000000002
yeah tony whitcomb i heard it's [ __ ]

2854.88 --> 2859.599
embarrassing

2856.24 --> 2862.8799999999997
it's embarrassing that he's just

2859.599 --> 2866.7200000000003
that he's even like accepting it

2862.88 --> 2867.6800000000003
as in accepting any authority about it

2866.72 --> 2870.9599999999996

weak that he's that he's dancing along

2889.44 --> 2894.559

2890.4 --> 2898.64
seems extremely personal weakness to me

2894.559 --> 2902.0

what he's doing is so [ __ ] gross i'm

2928.4 --> 2933.44
losing care

2930.4 --> 2935.76
to even know why he supposedly is doing

this i don't even want to know anymore

2935.76 --> 2941.88
it's just so [ __ ]

weird and that i would associate with

3017.28 --> 3021.28
ancient japanese this is like a friend

3019.44 --> 3023.92
would walk up to you and [ __ ] cut

3021.28 --> 3026.2400000000002
your head off for this behavior it's so

3023.92 --> 3028.7200000000003
[ __ ] gross just to spare you the

3026.24 --> 3031.4399999999996
dishonor of what the [ __ ] you think

3028.72 --> 3034.7999999999997
you're doing alex

i don't even care if this supposedly

3039.119 --> 3046.079
some smart deal or whatever the [ __ ] you

3041.52 --> 3048.559
think you're doing they're satanists

3046.079 --> 3050.96
now i know why you were oozing with

3048.559 --> 3053.2000000000003
luciferian energy more than i've ever

3050.96 --> 3055.28
seen anybody before

3053.2 --> 3059.52
like that

3055.28 --> 3059.52
which i said a few days ago yeah

3060.079 --> 3063.88
so gross

3068.01 --> 3071.1690000000003
[Music]

3080.319 --> 3085.839
does he even realize that by his

3082.96 --> 3089.359
attitude he is legitimizing this

3085.839 --> 3092.0789999999997
unprecedentedly idiotic and

3089.359 --> 3093.68
blatantly atrocious kangaroo court he's

3092.079 --> 3097.8390000000004
actually

3093.68 --> 3099.359
helping them to manifest it by doing

3097.839 --> 3101.839
this do you know that's what you're

3099.359 --> 3106.7999999999997
doing alex do you know that you are

3101.839 --> 3108.72
literally helping satanists now overtly

3106.8 --> 3111.7200000000003
by cocking to this

3108.72 --> 3111.72
overtly

3115.6 --> 3120.7999999999997
[Music]

3117.92 --> 3122.96
no brian is not in trouble

3120.8 --> 3125.2000000000003
he was just going berserk yesterday on

3122.96 --> 3127.599
me that's all

3125.2 --> 3130.48
it was just in a very irritated mood

3127.599 --> 3134.0
it's kind of like i am sometimes on the

3130.48 --> 3135.92
friday shows in the past it's happened

3134.0 --> 3138.079
well he was very much like that although

3135.92 --> 3140.079
he yeah he went like three steps further

3138.079 --> 3142.319
than i ever would

3140.079 --> 3144.48
i would never just like start yelling

3142.319 --> 3146.72
foaming at the mouth like that

3144.48 --> 3148.96
it's ridiculous

3146.72 --> 3150.839
so that's on him

3148.96 --> 3153.839
but no he's not in

3150.839 --> 3156.72
trouble don't get in trouble for being

3153.839 --> 3156.72
very triggered

3157.359 --> 3161.52
unless that's you're gonna be your

3159.119 --> 3163.359
attitude from then on every day yeah

3161.52 --> 3165.28
then he's probably gonna

3163.359 --> 3167.2
just be like uh maybe you should just

3165.28 --> 3170.7200000000003
get a vacation or something

3167.2 --> 3170.72
i don't think that's gonna happen

3205.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
[ __ ] is that a rump what the hell

3221.2 --> 3225.2
damn it that's a sock but it's really

3223.2 --> 3227.9199999999996
hilarious

3225.2 --> 3230.16
that's that is the funniest sock i've

3227.92 --> 3232.64
seen in a long long time

3230.16 --> 3235.64

3232.64 --> 3235.64
oppassing

you're still a piece of [ __ ] probably

oh it's youtube

3250.559 --> 3253.0400000000004
okay

3258.88 --> 3264.1600000000003
that's fine as long as he stops whining

3261.119 --> 3267.599
about jarvis being somebody else he

3264.16 --> 3270.5589999999997
could be there all he likes because

3267.599 --> 3273.52
that romp that indian rhombus picture is

3270.559 --> 3273.52
freaking amazing

3275.359 --> 3279.44
are you saying

3277.2 --> 3282.64
are you seeing this tarret

3279.44 --> 3284.4
just check out like go oh yeah

3282.64 --> 3286.96
yeah you have a wrench so you can go to

3284.4 --> 3290.4
channel and then just look at that

3286.96 --> 3290.4
that is amazing

3291.68 --> 3295.16
thank you for that

3313.359 --> 3317.88
ah

3314.72 --> 3317.8799999999997

okay

3398.4 --> 3401.92

stop it

3401.92 --> 3406.96
i'm gonna look i might like your little

3404.88 --> 3407.839
sock account here if you're gonna whine

3406.96 --> 3409.52

3424.559 --> 3428.7200000000003
i will [ __ ] ban every freaking sock

3427.28 --> 3430.3190000000004
you ever made

3428.72 --> 3432.16
i don't care

3430.319 --> 3434.72
you're not to do this today you

3432.16 --> 3434.72
understand

3445.2 --> 3448.9199999999996
need some fresh air

3473.839 --> 3475.92
you

3476.03 --> 3479.219
[Music]

3497.2 --> 3500.2
hmm

3520.559 --> 3523.0400000000004
okay

3525.04 --> 3532.72
don't mention planes speeding up towards

3528.64 --> 3532.72
the equator why not

3534.24 --> 3537.839
i please keep it english

3539.68 --> 3542.68
no

3555.68 --> 3560.96
you drink like why what don't mention

3558.96 --> 3562.0
planes speeding up towards the equator

3560.96 --> 3565.44
why

3562.0 --> 3565.44
why shouldn't we mention that

3565.839 --> 3569.359
now is that actually true

3570.4 --> 3573.839
where's that coming from

3600.16 --> 3604.0789999999997
i mean i could i don't know if that if

3602.559 --> 3607.3590000000004
it's anything

3604.079 --> 3610.0
true right if it is i can

3607.359 --> 3610.0
figure out

3610.48 --> 3614.72
what could what could be that why you

3612.799 --> 3617.92
know i mean

3614.72 --> 3620.16
it's going to be hotter at the equator

3617.92 --> 3620.16
so

3620.4 --> 3624.4
less air friction

3622.799 --> 3626.4
on average

3624.4 --> 3629.839
more air lift

3626.4 --> 3629.839
right hot air rising

3632.319 --> 3635.5589999999997
the [ __ ]

3643.92 --> 3646.319
dude

3654.839 --> 3660.16
just earth is stationary so they don't

3657.599 --> 3660.7200000000003
need this yeah the

3660.16 --> 3662.799
hey

3660.72 --> 3666.0789999999997
[Music]

3662.799 --> 3669.119
i'm just saying if there is such a thing

3666.079 --> 3671.04
i could probably figure out why

3669.119 --> 3672.96
the speed of

3671.04 --> 3676.16
air travel would be increasing as they

3672.96 --> 3678.559
approach the equator if that were true

3676.16 --> 3679.44
right i just gave you a

3678.559 --> 3681.92
hint

3679.44 --> 3684.2400000000002
now i don't know if it's true for any

3681.92 --> 3685.6800000000003
reason or not

3684.24 --> 3688.0
but

3685.68 --> 3690.319
even if it was true the reason would

3688.0 --> 3691.52
definitely not be because of the earth

3690.319 --> 3695.48
spin

3691.52 --> 3695.48
because it there isn't any

3700.24 --> 3704.9599999999996
no this wasn't a ball-winning answer to

3702.4 --> 3708.2400000000002
playing speed increase

3704.96 --> 3708.2400000000002
now that wasn't bowing

3710.96 --> 3714.319
that was just our win

3714.48 --> 3719.359
that's me

3716.72 --> 3721.4399999999996
basically defining

3719.359 --> 3726.44
the situation

3721.44 --> 3726.44
right is it true why could it be true

3728.96 --> 3733.2
i'd like to basically answer

3731.28 --> 3734.6400000000003
questions before i even figure out

3733.2 --> 3736.96
whether it is a

3734.64 --> 3740.839
true question or not

3736.96 --> 3740.839
that's kind of what i do

3754.96 --> 3759.68
air pushes the planes faster he's with

3757.68 --> 3761.7599999999998
us

3759.68 --> 3765.1189999999997
oh my god

3761.76 --> 3767.3590000000004
yeah wolfy is just an idiot and a liar

3765.119 --> 3770.4
but that's fine

3767.359 --> 3771.44
that's not fine but

3770.4 --> 3773.6800000000003
yeah

3771.44 --> 3776.0
i mean there are wind streams okay they

3773.68 --> 3778.0789999999997
exist there are wind streams they're

3776.0 --> 3779.839
very high up

3778.079 --> 3782.2400000000002
yeah

3779.839 --> 3785.119
one layer they might go one direction

3782.24 --> 3787.1189999999997
and then another layer another

3785.119 --> 3788.7200000000003
so

3787.119 --> 3791.28
it does not

3788.72 --> 3793.68
comport with any kind of earth spin

3791.28 --> 3796.4
model it's just wind streams up there

3793.68 --> 3799.839
that's all

3796.4 --> 3799.839
in the global no no no

3801.839 --> 3806.0
but in the globe model there would be

3803.76 --> 3807.6800000000003
coriolis deviation

3806.0 --> 3810.559
and the earth would simply be spinning

3807.68 --> 3813.52
underneath the air all the time

3810.559 --> 3814.96
but that is definitely not actually

3813.52 --> 3817.359
happening

3814.96 --> 3819.039
as a result anti-flat earthers have

3817.359 --> 3820.5589999999997
started to claim that they wouldn't

3819.039 --> 3822.3190000000004
expect to see

3820.559 --> 3823.599
earth spin and that

3822.319 --> 3824.72
well

3823.599 --> 3827.599
our

3824.72 --> 3829.4399999999996
reference frames are ruined

3827.599 --> 3831.44
even though we don't have any and

3829.44 --> 3833.52
they're supposed to be having reference

3831.44 --> 3835.839
frames that they deny

3833.52 --> 3838.72
and then project that need

3835.839 --> 3840.48
that they deny unto us their opponent

3838.72 --> 3842.64
that is pointing out how they don't have

3840.48 --> 3842.64
it

3845.68 --> 3849.9199999999996
no the air does not move with the earth

3850.24 --> 3854.799
it's how how does it do that air does

3852.48 --> 3857.76
not retain momentum it only responds to

3854.799 --> 3860.48
the local air pressure differential

3857.76 --> 3862.1600000000003
air cannot move in lock step it's not a

3860.48 --> 3865.599
liquid

3862.16 --> 3865.5989999999997
it doesn't retain momentum

3865.68 --> 3871.2
it stands still until locally pressed

3868.799 --> 3871.2
upon

3872.72 --> 3877.9199999999996
so unless there is like giant flaps

3876.559 --> 3879.28
like a

3877.92 --> 3881.039
is it

3879.28 --> 3883.2000000000003
like a mill

3881.039 --> 3885.6800000000003
right or uh

3883.2 --> 3885.68
what is it

3886.4 --> 3891.52
like a water wheel right a wheel that is

3889.44 --> 3893.76
like propelled by water

3891.52 --> 3897.359
unless the earth is literally covered by

3893.76 --> 3900.7200000000003
like flaps of like a water wheel to keep

3897.359 --> 3902.5589999999997
pushing the air with its presupposed

3900.72 --> 3907.2
rotation

3902.559 --> 3908.88
it's not gonna move with the earth

3907.2 --> 3910.96
it doesn't do that

3908.88 --> 3913.52
like it doesn't even do that in the

3910.96 --> 3915.52
small scale like if you're in a car and

3913.52 --> 3917.2
you close all the windows

3915.52 --> 3919.599
and then you accelerate and you have

3917.2 --> 3922.48
like a balloon inside

3919.599 --> 3924.48
the air is going to shift because you're

3922.48 --> 3925.52
moving you're accelerating it's going to

3924.48 --> 3927.839
shift

3925.52 --> 3930.72
the air is going to redivide itself the

3927.839 --> 3933.44
pressure within that compartment yeah if

3930.72 --> 3935.1189999999997
that happens in one moving car what do

3933.44 --> 3938.48
you think is going to happen with all

3935.119 --> 3940.799
the air that's supposedly sitting on top

3938.48 --> 3943.76
of the ball

3940.799 --> 3943.7599999999998
it's not going to happen

3945.44 --> 3953.44
air cannot move in lock step with other

3948.799 --> 3955.92
material liquids and solids can be made

3953.44 --> 3959.039
to move in lockstep with a rotation

3955.92 --> 3960.0
movement that can happen

3959.039 --> 3963.76
air

3960.0 --> 3965.92
gases cannot be made to do that unless

3963.76 --> 3968.079
they're specifically

3965.92 --> 3970.319
cornered off separated in their own

3968.079 --> 3972.799
container and then that entire container

3970.319 --> 3975.0389999999998
is moved with it and then even within

3972.799 --> 3979.119
that separated container the gas will

3975.039 --> 3983.8390000000004
slightly risk redistribute itself

3979.119 --> 3986.7200000000003
because air doesn't naturally move

3983.839 --> 3989.44
with environments it's not susceptible

3986.72 --> 3989.4399999999996
to momentum

3990.88 --> 3995.44
earth is not accelerating like a car you

3992.72 --> 3997.9199999999996
have their centripetal force

3995.44 --> 4000.64
it is moving and it is moving on a large

3997.92 --> 4003.039
large scale

4000.64 --> 4004.799
doesn't matter if it's accelerating

4003.039 --> 4006.48
constantly or if it's moving in a

4004.799 --> 4009.839
constant speed

4006.48 --> 4014.079
air cannot be made to move in lock step

4009.839 --> 4016.799
with any form of rotation ever

4014.079 --> 4018.4
you cannot demonstrate air

4016.799 --> 4021.4
rotating

4018.4 --> 4021.4
continually

4021.68 --> 4026.96
like without being directly guided by

4024.48 --> 4028.4
the by the container that in itself is

4026.96 --> 4031.039
moving

4028.4 --> 4033.76
air does not move in lockstep you can

4031.039 --> 4037.44
rotate like a batch of material any way

4033.76 --> 4040.559
you want the air among it is never

4037.44 --> 4043.119
ever no matter how fast or slow you spin

4040.559 --> 4044.88
it's never ever going to end up moving

4043.119 --> 4048.0
in lockstep with the rest of the

4044.88 --> 4051.119
material because gas is not susceptible

4048.0 --> 4053.119
by momentum no matter how much you spin

4051.119 --> 4055.599
it it's never gonna start moving in

4053.119 --> 4060.44
lockstep with the rest of the material

4055.599 --> 4060.44
that's a physics fact

4065.44 --> 4071.2000000000003
it doesn't matter at face

4068.16 --> 4071.2
you're strawmanning me

4072.319 --> 4078.48
it was just a visual example it wasn't a

4075.359 --> 4081.359
literal exact example it was only a

4078.48 --> 4083.68
visual example so you could actually do

4081.359 --> 4088.0789999999997
something on your own it was there for

4083.68 --> 4090.8799999999997
you to realize that if you move air

4088.079 --> 4092.96
it's not going to just move with

4090.88 --> 4096.4800000000005
everything

4092.96 --> 4096.4800000000005
it's not just going to do that

4097.279 --> 4104.2390000000005
especially if it's rotatory movement

4100.88 --> 4107.279
yeah you don't do that in a car you move

4104.239 --> 4107.2789999999995
in a straight line

4107.92 --> 4113.1990000000005
right but hey even in a car

4110.799 --> 4115.6
you you literally did it to yourself at

4113.199 --> 4118.5599999999995
face you're actually wrong yeah you can

4115.6 --> 4121.1990000000005
do the balloon thing in a car and

4118.56 --> 4124.4800000000005
driving at a constant speed

4121.199 --> 4126.879999999999
in a perfect circle track

4124.48 --> 4129.5199999999995
guess what's going to happen the gas

4126.88 --> 4132.719
inside of that car moving at a constant

4129.52 --> 4135.120000000001
speed in a circular track is not going

4132.719 --> 4137.199
to move in lock step the balloon is

4135.12 --> 4139.199
going to shift it's not just going to

4137.199 --> 4141.678999999999
sit there even if you're riding in a

4139.199 --> 4144.0
constant speed at face you did it to

4141.679 --> 4147.279
yourself you dummy

4144.0 --> 4150.64
gas doesn't move in lock step yeah the

4147.279 --> 4152.080000000001
earth spin is not a straight line it's a

4150.64 --> 4154.159000000001
circle

4152.08 --> 4156.96
there is a centripetal

4154.159 --> 4156.96
influences

4159.759 --> 4164.799
no air does not have momentum you

4161.759 --> 4164.799
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4166.159 --> 4171.759
sailing ships what no no that's not

4169.44 --> 4175.839
momentum you [ __ ] with

4171.759 --> 4177.92
that's air pressure differential

4175.839 --> 4182.239
already set that

4177.92 --> 4185.12
air pressure differential local pressure

4182.239 --> 4188.5599999999995
gas can be certainly pressurized it's

4185.12 --> 4190.48
going to push that push yeah could be

4188.56 --> 4192.159000000001
caught

4190.48 --> 4194.32
by an object and then it's going to

4192.159 --> 4195.679
propel that object that's called sailing

4194.32 --> 4198.08
yeah

4195.679 --> 4200.56
it's not momentum

4198.08 --> 4202.8
that's local air pressure differential

4200.56 --> 4204.64
gases respond to local air pressure

4202.8 --> 4206.719
differentials

4204.64 --> 4208.8
which can be from other gas surrounding

4206.719 --> 4210.64
it which has to be eventually on the

4208.8 --> 4213.28
container now unless the entire

4210.64 --> 4216.92
container is moving

4213.28 --> 4216.92
it's not going to happen

4217.36 --> 4221.5199999999995
unless again

4218.96 --> 4223.52
there's a dynamic system out there heat

4221.52 --> 4224.4800000000005
can like really sit on something that

4223.52 --> 4225.92
can

4224.48 --> 4227.5199999999995
cause a

4225.92 --> 4229.76
pressure

4227.52 --> 4232.080000000001
uh what do you call the meteorology a

4229.76 --> 4234.4800000000005
pressure front the pressure front is

4232.08 --> 4236.64
going to cause wind the wind is not

4234.48 --> 4238.239
because the earth is moving it's because

4236.64 --> 4240.2390000000005
there's a pressure front and it's

4238.239 --> 4242.159
equalizing itself all that air is

4240.239 --> 4243.599999999999
pushing against all the air that's right

4242.159 --> 4246.08
next to it local air pressure

4243.6 --> 4248.400000000001
differential and if an object is caught

4246.08 --> 4252.159
within that it's going to be pushed

4248.4 --> 4252.159
along that's called sailing

4255.6 --> 4259.92
yeah it will

4257.199 --> 4261.839999999999
you're wrong at face

4259.92 --> 4264.64
and we're talking about a car a

4261.84 --> 4267.679
closed-off car

4264.64 --> 4270.56
yeah you try it out the balloon is not

4267.679 --> 4274.0
gonna sit still in that car

4270.56 --> 4275.6
it's not just gonna sit like that

4274.0 --> 4278.8
you're driving in a circle there's

4275.6 --> 4279.92
centripetal forces i mean

4278.8 --> 4282.400000000001
please

4279.92 --> 4285.04
don't make me correct you on like the

4282.4 --> 4289.04
fundamental basics of like even

4285.04 --> 4289.04
newtonian physics at this point

4289.679 --> 4296.0
don't destroy every piece of sensibility

4293.04 --> 4298.64
you ever had in favor of your ridiculous

4296.0 --> 4300.56
ball religion don't do it don't destroy

4298.64 --> 4304.12
your own knowledge

4300.56 --> 4304.120000000001
don't do it

4315.6 --> 4320.120000000001
yes

4316.8 --> 4320.12
they do

4338.48 --> 4341.599999999999
okay

4340.48 --> 4343.5599999999995
that's

4341.6 --> 4345.679
we don't need to go into their

4343.56 --> 4346.96
presuppositions to prove them wrong on

4345.679 --> 4350.2390000000005
this turret

4346.96 --> 4350.2390000000005
you're just giving them

4350.4 --> 4354.08
the presupposition if you do that

4354.8 --> 4360.159000000001
doesn't matter if the sun's speed around

4357.76 --> 4362.96
the if there's alleged speed around the

4360.159 --> 4365.28
sun is constant it doesn't matter it's

4362.96 --> 4366.8
all relative anyway

4365.28 --> 4368.88
not thought about

4366.8 --> 4372.159000000001
there's no actual momentums or

4368.88 --> 4374.32
centripetal forces cr yeah calculated

4372.159 --> 4377.04
within the heliocentric model so it's

4374.32 --> 4379.12
all relative

4377.04 --> 4382.12
it's all just [ __ ] don't think about

4379.12 --> 4382.12
it

4400.68 --> 4403.859
[Music]

4410.4 --> 4415.12
oh my god

4412.719 --> 4418.56
you're [ __ ] numpty that's literally

4415.12 --> 4421.12
what i said at face that's literally

4418.56 --> 4424.6
what i said

4421.12 --> 4424.599999999999
you dumbass

4424.88 --> 4427.979
[Music]

4434.96 --> 4439.52
i mean don't try to gaslight me like

4437.6 --> 4442.64
you're the one making that argument i

4439.52 --> 4445.679
literally just made that argument to you

4442.64 --> 4448.56
i literally said that

4445.679 --> 4448.56
unbelievable

4453.679 --> 4457.92
how is that comparable to the atmosphere

4462.08 --> 4467.5199999999995
well it isn't because

4465.36 --> 4469.12
the earth is not moving

4467.52 --> 4471.76
and so

4469.12 --> 4473.76
air is not going to be pushed

4471.76 --> 4476.320000000001
to some side

4473.76 --> 4478.8
or be made to stand still

4476.32 --> 4481.36
because the earth is stationary

4478.8 --> 4483.4400000000005
yeah we don't actually get that effect

4481.36 --> 4484.48
that we would see if the earth was

4483.44 --> 4486.5599999999995
spitting

4484.48 --> 4488.959999999999
like you're in a car driving at a

4486.56 --> 4491.84
constant speed in a circle and then a

4488.96 --> 4494.8
balloon inside your car is gonna

4491.84 --> 4497.4400000000005
be notched to one side constantly yeah

4494.8 --> 4500.159000000001
that's the air redistributing itself

4497.44 --> 4502.96
based on the centripetal forces yeah we

4500.159 --> 4505.599999999999
don't see that on earth

4502.96 --> 4509.4
because it's stationary

4505.6 --> 4509.400000000001
that was my point

4512.719 --> 4515.719
ugh

4525.76 --> 4529.52
gases don't have momentum they only

4528.08 --> 4531.44
respond to local air pressure

4529.52 --> 4533.1990000000005
differential in a closed off car with a

4531.44 --> 4534.879999999999
balloon in it if you're gonna drive in a

4533.199 --> 4538.799999999999
circle

4534.88 --> 4540.8
the gas is not just going to move

4538.8 --> 4541.84
with whatever is in the car no matter

4540.8 --> 4544.400000000001
what

4541.84 --> 4546.2390000000005
it's gonna respond to local air pressure

4544.4 --> 4548.48
differential which would be caused by

4546.239 --> 4550.959999999999
the container moving

4548.48 --> 4552.959999999999
and then pushing on that gas

4550.96 --> 4555.36
that is contained within it

4552.96 --> 4558.08
because the gas is not going to go and

4555.36 --> 4560.32
move in lockstep with whatever movement

4558.08 --> 4562.88
the container is going to make

4560.32 --> 4564.799999999999
it's just going to push on one side of

4562.88 --> 4566.88
the gas that's going to be pushed

4564.8 --> 4569.04
forward by it

4566.88 --> 4571.1990000000005
only because the container wall is there

4569.04 --> 4572.239
to push it forward the gas is not just

4571.199 --> 4574.879999999999
going to

4572.239 --> 4577.678999999999
move perfectly synchronous with the

4574.88 --> 4580.32
container as the container is moving

4577.679 --> 4582.32
that doesn't happen because gas pressure

4580.32 --> 4583.36
doesn't respond

4582.32 --> 4585.12
to

4583.36 --> 4587.679
spin or anything it doesn't have

4585.12 --> 4589.5199999999995
momentum it's not susceptible to that it

4587.679 --> 4591.679
only responds to local air pressure

4589.52 --> 4592.84
differential that was my entire argument

4591.679 --> 4595.76
thank you

4592.84 --> 4600.08
for confirming

4595.76 --> 4600.08
it for me at face great

4601.98 --> 4607.199
[Music]

4604.88 --> 4608.88
what container the necessary antecedent

4607.199 --> 4611.28
in order to have gas pressure the

4608.88 --> 4614.4800000000005
natural law that was established a long

4611.28 --> 4617.12
time ago as a foundation of physics

4614.48 --> 4619.839999999999
that container the container which we do

4617.12 --> 4622.48
not have to know the dimensions of but

4619.84 --> 4624.64
what we can definitely conclude has to

4622.48 --> 4627.44
be there because we have gas pressure

4624.64 --> 4631.280000000001
and it is the necessary antecedent to

4627.44 --> 4634.799999999999
have gas pressure you cannot calculate

4631.28 --> 4636.96
gas pressure without container

4634.8 --> 4640.159000000001
the walls of the container are literally

4636.96 --> 4643.04
that which that factor that you need to

4640.159 --> 4645.44
fill in in your calculation to calculate

4643.04 --> 4647.44
gas pressure you need the container to

4645.44 --> 4650.839999999999
do that you can't even calculate it

4647.44 --> 4650.839999999999
without it

4651.12 --> 4654.32
that container

4661.36 --> 4667.199
hey

4662.84 --> 4669.360000000001
lg you need to have a force to pressure

4667.199 --> 4669.36
no

4669.6 --> 4672.56
not necessary

4672.88 --> 4677.0
pressure you first need containment

4678.07 --> 4681.139999999999
[Music]

4683.04 --> 4687.679
besides gas pressure expanding in all

4684.96 --> 4689.12
directions has a inherent

4687.679 --> 4690.84
force it's

4689.12 --> 4694.5599999999995
one of the most powerful forces in

4690.84 --> 4696.159000000001
nature nature abhors a vacuum

4694.56 --> 4698.8
it's inherent

4696.159 --> 4701.44
like it's not a thing that has to happen

4698.8 --> 4704.159000000001
to the material externally it is

4701.44 --> 4707.839999999999
inherent in the material itself

4704.159 --> 4711.04
the gas will expand explosively in all

4707.84 --> 4713.1990000000005
directions to fill the available volume

4711.04 --> 4715.12
and attempt to equalize come in

4713.199 --> 4718.32
equilibrium with all the other gas

4715.12 --> 4719.599999999999
pressure and the container walls

4718.32 --> 4722.239
together

4719.6 --> 4725.1990000000005
and then after it's sort of equalized

4722.239 --> 4727.759999999999
yeah whatever other forces are within

4725.199 --> 4729.839999999999
that containment present like nature

4727.76 --> 4731.4400000000005
influences the sun

4729.84 --> 4733.92
heat

4731.44 --> 4735.36
introduced on the ground level all that

4733.92 --> 4736.719
however else

4735.36 --> 4739.759999999999
it all works

4736.719 --> 4741.84
that's gonna cause well a

4739.76 --> 4745.1990000000005
pressure differential

4741.84 --> 4745.1990000000005
within the containment

4747.04 --> 4751.199
yeah and it's secondary to the gas

4749.12 --> 4753.92
having expanded within that container if

4751.199 --> 4756.08
the gas wouldn't be able to expand to

4753.92 --> 4759.04
fill the container because their

4756.08 --> 4761.44
container is virtually infinite

4759.04 --> 4763.84
then no gradient could ever form because

4761.44 --> 4767.5199999999995
a gradient is always secondary

4763.84 --> 4770.0
to gas filling the available volume and

4767.52 --> 4774.52
starting to press equally against all

4770.0 --> 4774.52
other gas and the container walls

4785.92 --> 4790.92
what container does the ocean sit in

4792.719 --> 4795.52
i don't know

4793.76 --> 4797.679
but it's containment because it's

4795.52 --> 4799.6
sitting there

4797.679 --> 4802.08
if it wasn't containment then it would

4799.6 --> 4804.64
just go through it

4802.08 --> 4806.96
whatever it is the bottom

4804.64 --> 4810.2390000000005
i think there is simply a limited

4806.96 --> 4812.8
volumetric available space

4810.239 --> 4815.36
it's like a cube in which

4812.8 --> 4818.0
matter can exist

4815.36 --> 4820.639
like there doesn't need to be a a

4818.0 --> 4822.239
physical built container to contain

4820.639 --> 4824.32
everything

4822.239 --> 4828.4
because there's no other

4824.32 --> 4830.32
volume out there to contain it from the

4828.4 --> 4831.5199999999995
limited amount of volume that is

4830.32 --> 4835.12
available

4831.52 --> 4835.120000000001
is the container

4835.44 --> 4840.239
there is no infinite outer space there

4837.679 --> 4841.92
is no infinite volume there is a limited

4840.239 --> 4844.799999999999
volume you don't need a physical

4841.92 --> 4846.719
container you only need a limited volume

4844.8 --> 4850.88
limited dimension

4846.719 --> 4853.76
of physically available space

4850.88 --> 4855.84
you don't need a physical thing to be a

4853.76 --> 4858.400000000001
barrier that would only make sense if

4855.84 --> 4862.159000000001
there was more space to

4858.4 --> 4864.96
bear to bar it from right a barrier

4862.159 --> 4867.28
bar to bar it something gets in the way

4864.96 --> 4868.639
in the way of what something else that's

4867.28 --> 4870.5599999999995
there

4868.639 --> 4873.6
why are you thinking there is something

4870.56 --> 4877.4400000000005
else out there there isn't

4873.6 --> 4879.84
there is no available space

4877.44 --> 4881.599999999999
beyond any virtual barrier it doesn't

4879.84 --> 4883.52
need to be a barrier it just needs to be

4881.6 --> 4885.92
the end of the available volume for

4883.52 --> 4888.4800000000005
matter to move into that is all it

4885.92 --> 4890.719
doesn't have to be a physical thing to

4888.48 --> 4894.04
do that it just needs to be a limitation

4890.719 --> 4894.04
to the volume

4894.38 --> 4897.52

4909.84 --> 4915.1990000000005
okay i'll leave you to it lsg and like

4912.8 --> 4917.04
i've already laid down everything

4915.199 --> 4920.239
everything again

4917.04 --> 4920.239
i'm going to give the bird some

4920.36 --> 4924.599999999999

4947.92 --> 4951.4

5184.48 --> 5187.199
oh goody

5188.719 --> 5193.52
really dare it you're gonna take the

5190.96 --> 5196.639
nasa [ __ ] story that i completely

5193.52 --> 5199.92
dismantled against at space

5196.639 --> 5202.92
on this really you're gonna go there

5199.92 --> 5202.92
wow

5223.12 --> 5227.679
it's not come there is no movement

5227.76 --> 5230.2390000000005
all right

5231.28 --> 5235.12
this is you're straw manning your own

5233.44 --> 5238.239
side here

5235.12 --> 5240.48
constantly there is no movement

5238.239 --> 5243.5199999999995
it's the conservation of stationary

5240.48 --> 5246.718999999999
momentum because there is no momentum

5243.52 --> 5249.679
there is no movement it's stationary

5246.719 --> 5252.639
conservation of stationary momentum

5249.679 --> 5257.719
it's not a constant rate

5252.639 --> 5257.719
it's a constant non-movement rate

5282.8 --> 5287.12
what

5284.639 --> 5291.04
really what are you talking about

5287.12 --> 5291.04
mobius mapping what what is that

5292.4 --> 5297.719
what am i talking about what am i not

5294.32 --> 5297.719
talking about

5316.4 --> 5319.4
hmm

5333.6 --> 5337.1990000000005
yeah again

5334.84 --> 5338.719
inspector talked about all kinds of

5337.199 --> 5341.36
things

5338.719 --> 5344.0
oh god yeah we already talked about that

5341.36 --> 5345.679
don't just god

5344.0 --> 5349.1
damn it

5345.679 --> 5352.139
everybody's to talk about it

[Music]

5357.39 --> 5360.579000000001
[Music]

5380.88 --> 5385.52
all right don't see it is just an act

5383.12 --> 5388.0
yeah that's extremely unspecific but it

5385.52 --> 5390.080000000001
could be true i mean

5388.0 --> 5393.199
this whole shitty thing

5390.08 --> 5395.679
and it's not like the only person

5393.199 --> 5397.44
that's going through this sort of thing

5395.679 --> 5400.719
there's others

5397.44 --> 5400.719
it might be a

5401.12 --> 5405.28
crisis act

5403.199 --> 5407.759999999999
court

5405.28 --> 5410.159
i get it a court that wants to set a

5407.76 --> 5413.04
precedent it doesn't have any legitimacy

5410.159 --> 5416.159
to do so but if they can snare and pay

5413.04 --> 5418.239
off somebody to be a recipient

5416.159 --> 5420.96
and then to play into everything that

5418.239 --> 5423.44
they want to do

5420.96 --> 5427.52
then they could like shift or attempt to

5423.44 --> 5430.0
do so public or opinion or cohesion

5427.52 --> 5432.96
it's like political manipulation

5430.0 --> 5436.159
but with the court system

5432.96 --> 5438.32
right this is all i have no lead this is

5436.159 --> 5440.48
literally just virtual in my mind and it

5438.32 --> 5443.679
could be it could be that that's the

5440.48 --> 5445.759999999999
case it smells like it almost

5443.679 --> 5447.92
like it's a crisis act like they're not

5445.76 --> 5450.0
actually being targeted because that's

5447.92 --> 5451.36
not the natural way to respond to such a

5450.0 --> 5453.28
situation

5451.36 --> 5455.28
the way alex is doing and some other

5453.28 --> 5457.36
people out there as well

5455.28 --> 5460.159
that have their own predicaments very

5457.36 --> 5460.159
similar to this

5461.199 --> 5464.48
if you're

5462.48 --> 5466.879999999999
facing a kangaroo court that's out of

5464.48 --> 5470.0
control your response should not be oh

5466.88 --> 5471.84
please please help me

5470.0 --> 5474.08
it should be this is a mockery of

5471.84 --> 5476.08
justice i do not recognize your

5474.08 --> 5478.0
authority

5476.08 --> 5480.96
and will do everything in my power to

5478.0 --> 5482.8
negate everything that you're trying to

5480.96 --> 5486.08
do here

5482.8 --> 5488.2390000000005
not oh please i need support to pay off

5486.08 --> 5489.92
the fines of this ridiculous kanger

5488.239 --> 5492.5599999999995
record that's not what you're supposed

5489.92 --> 5492.56
to be doing

5493.36 --> 5498.719
and that's what makes it feel like it's

5495.44 --> 5498.719
a giant crisis act

5501.92 --> 5509.28
and it could be

5505.199 --> 5509.28
i wouldn't put it below him

5515.92 --> 5518.92
hmm

5524.239 --> 5527.44
okay interesting lychee i'll take a look

5526.4 --> 5530.44
at that

5527.44 --> 5530.44
later

5533.84 --> 5539.4400000000005
i know gadget inspector i know

5537.44 --> 5542.0
that's part of the reason why i think it

5539.44 --> 5544.96
might literally be part of a crisis act

5542.0 --> 5548.159
that he is literally shilling for this

5544.96 --> 5550.8
communist marxist court system

5548.159 --> 5554.0
yeah it it would be that bad

5550.8 --> 5556.320000000001
it would be that bad evil dark inside

5554.0 --> 5559.6
out dark world

5556.32 --> 5561.5199999999995
reversed world satanic

5559.6 --> 5564.56
because there's absolutely no reason for

5561.52 --> 5566.639
him to do that no reason whatsoever not

5564.56 --> 5569.04
even being threatened to be killed or

5566.639 --> 5570.56
assassinated would be a reason to do

5569.04 --> 5573.36
that

5570.56 --> 5574.96
there is no logical reason other than

5573.36 --> 5579.36
you're part of a scheme and you're

5574.96 --> 5579.36
probably being paid to be part of that

5580.4 --> 5587.12
being paid to be a mock victim which is

5584.08 --> 5589.84
what crisis acting is

5587.12 --> 5589.84
isn't it

5590.48 --> 5593.5199999999995
fake victimhood

5595.92 --> 5599.4400000000005
but like in conjunction with the

5597.76 --> 5600.96
perpetrators

5599.44 --> 5602.879999999999
it's a scheme

5600.96 --> 5606.96
that's what like crisis acting

5602.88 --> 5606.96
effectively is like on every level

5607.36 --> 5612.28
everywhere

5608.48 --> 5612.28
whenever it's applied

5623.6 --> 5627.84
yeah they don't want people there

5625.28 --> 5630.88
questioning it's ridiculous

5627.84 --> 5632.639
these people should all be shot

5630.88 --> 5635.28
shot dead

5632.639 --> 5636.8
in a ditch

5635.28 --> 5641.199
they have like

5636.8 --> 5641.1990000000005
lime thrown on them it's disgusting

5643.44 --> 5645.44
mainstream

5644.4 --> 5647.839999999999
media

5645.44 --> 5650.799999999999
people that organization that

5647.84 --> 5655.08
those group of conspiracy the guild you

5650.8 --> 5655.08
could say they should all die

5662.08 --> 5666.96
i mean

5663.84 --> 5671.1990000000005
to just call out straight out like

5666.96 --> 5674.08
communist infiltrating treachery

5671.199 --> 5675.919999999999
is really not that far-fetched

5674.08 --> 5677.6
doesn't really matter who they are where

5675.92 --> 5679.52
they are because

5677.6 --> 5682.159000000001
they act the same they have the same

5679.52 --> 5683.76
objective everywhere they they function

5682.159 --> 5685.679
in every country

5683.76 --> 5687.119000000001
they are infiltrants they're

5685.679 --> 5689.52
marxist

5687.119 --> 5692.4
anti-nationalists

5689.52 --> 5695.6
and they literally parasite and gaslight

5692.4 --> 5698.159
and destroy people

5695.6 --> 5699.1990000000005
and they're gloating over that

5698.159 --> 5701.36
they're

5699.199 --> 5704.96
satanic witches

5701.36 --> 5704.96
marxist infiltrators

5707.44 --> 5712.0
okay that's a little exaggerated there

5709.52 --> 5715.76
terry i would i was

5712.0 --> 5717.28
i was expecting something like that

5715.76 --> 5719.92
no

5717.28 --> 5723.199
no that's ridiculous

5719.92 --> 5723.1990000000005
but i don't know to maybe

5723.84 --> 5728.88
maybe just have very specific little

5726.639 --> 5731.28
fire bunker busters

5728.88 --> 5733.28
and just shoot them right

5731.28 --> 5736.0
right at their stinky little media

5733.28 --> 5737.28
studio right when they're streaming

5736.0 --> 5740.8
that would be

5737.28 --> 5740.8
maybe something they could do

5741.44 --> 5744.96
right like oh that's what you're going

5743.28 --> 5746.4
to use it for well then just the whole

5744.96 --> 5750.56
[ __ ] building and all the equipment

5746.4 --> 5750.5599999999995
and everything is just destroyed goodbye

5750.639 --> 5754.56
if you're only going to use it for satan

5752.48 --> 5756.638999999999
and evil then destroy

5754.56 --> 5760.639
then then nothing then nobody gets

5756.639 --> 5760.639
anything you just [ __ ] die

5764.96 --> 5772.0
so i'm all for that i'm all for bunker

just

5778.8 --> 5783.84
bunker buster fire bomb the [ __ ] out of

5781.199 --> 5787.28
the studios right when they're rolling

5783.84 --> 5789.360000000001
just do it everywhere everywhere just

5787.28 --> 5791.119
burn them to death

5789.36 --> 5794.679
right in the process so they can go

5791.119 --> 5794.679

steele is in the chat right now

6093.52 --> 6098.719
no not really at face i mean yeah i

6096.08 --> 6101.36
could do that

but i'm not

6103.76 --> 6107.52
i'm just gonna keep my powers to myself

6106.48 --> 6110.48
and not

6107.52 --> 6112.96
like grind it down to some skeletal

barely any grip could just exploit i'm

6115.119 --> 6120.199
not gonna do that

6116.719 --> 6120.199
how about that

6123.76 --> 6127.92
i'll just keep it for me

two different computers

of course you could use your computer

hard although yeah

6226.8 --> 6233.0
you're really gonna do that is he really

6228.639 --> 6233.0
gonna do that i don't think so

no don't

6244.48 --> 6248.959999999999

6299.84 --> 6306.08
i mean i've had worse but it's it's kind

6303.28 --> 6308.32
of annoying like i don't want to just

6306.08 --> 6311.84

they constantly go here

where's the flat earthers why don't i

6314.159 --> 6318.08
actually get flat earthers visiting me

6316.08 --> 6320.48
why am i constantly being swarmed by

6318.08 --> 6324.119

no territ

6431.119 --> 6434.639
you just need to stop poking them and

6432.96 --> 6436.88
then they'll stop talking and whining

6434.639 --> 6436.88
about

6440.84 --> 6445.1990000000005
it i already gave them a warning about

6444.4 --> 6447.199
not

6445.199 --> 6449.44
whining to each other about it over and

6447.199 --> 6451.919999999999
over again they stopped

6449.44 --> 6454.24
so you should then stop poking them

6451.92 --> 6457.45
about it as well

6470.639 --> 6472.88

6471.6 --> 6476.320000000001
anyway

6472.88 --> 6480.1990000000005
i'm probably gonna round out the show

6476.32 --> 6480.199
in a few minutes anyway

6489.36 --> 6494.199
yeah at least g quite so indeed

6500.719 --> 6506.56
right so yeah before i uh go i would

6503.6 --> 6506.56
still like to ask

6506.719 --> 6513.119
if people could please

6510.08 --> 6515.28
donate to my paypal

6513.119 --> 6516.88
or become part of patreon why not write

6515.28 --> 6519.599999999999
if you like that if you're okay with

6516.88 --> 6522.0
that but i really do need the continuing

6519.6 --> 6525.119000000001
support and

6522.0 --> 6526.88
well i'm handling all this right

6525.119 --> 6529.119
i mean

6526.88 --> 6530.719
give me a break

6529.119 --> 6533.04
this is what i got to deal with these

6530.719 --> 6533.04
days

6535.44 --> 6540.199
and yeah i don't like getting hungry

6540.8 --> 6546.320000000001
so i would really appreciate the support

6543.36 --> 6549.04
it's really that simple i'm not secretly

6546.32 --> 6551.28
building some squirt fund or whatever

6549.04 --> 6554.56
this is literally for my own life

6551.28 --> 6556.32
maintenance mostly for food and for some

6554.56 --> 6558.8
smokes to be fair

6556.32 --> 6561.28
but i don't overdo it

6558.8 --> 6565.119000000001
and besides the smokes

6561.28 --> 6566.159
is also for my eating

6565.119 --> 6569.119
like

6566.159 --> 6571.92
cannabis has always been very helpful

6569.119 --> 6573.839999999999
for me to literally be able to eat

6571.92 --> 6575.119
properly

6573.84 --> 6577.679
i had a

6575.119 --> 6579.759999999999
period where i didn't smoke any

6577.679 --> 6583.119
is it five years

6579.76 --> 6586.320000000001
and i lost like so much weight in that

6583.119 --> 6589.5199999999995
time and it was not in a good way

6586.32 --> 6591.199
because it's just like

6589.52 --> 6594.639
it

6591.199 --> 6596.799999999999
yeah maybe i've just i need it it which

6594.639 --> 6598.88
is like kind of pathetic right to need

6596.8 --> 6601.04
any herb or anything

6598.88 --> 6604.639
but i think that i've just grown to kind

6601.04 --> 6605.92
of need it to basically have proper

6604.639 --> 6608.159000000001
digestion

6605.92 --> 6610.639
or something

6608.159 --> 6612.799999999999
so it yeah that's the way it is i'd love

6610.639 --> 6614.88
to make it a lot cheaper and have my own

6612.8 --> 6616.56
garden and grow it myself or something

6614.88 --> 6618.96
although i probably need to grow more

6616.56 --> 6622.8
than i am allowed to

6618.96 --> 6626.32
but yeah that's what it's for

6622.8 --> 6629.04
and rent and all that [ __ ] which is just

6626.32 --> 6632.0
very expensive all together

6629.04 --> 6635.119
and yeah my social welfare is not

6632.0 --> 6637.44
exactly a a giant uh

6635.119 --> 6638.799999999999
cauldron of gold pieces if you know what

6637.44 --> 6641.44
i mean

6638.8 --> 6645.4400000000005
i can barely get around i couldn't get

6641.44 --> 6647.28
around before i was doing this at all

6645.44 --> 6649.839999999999
like i couldn't get around

6647.28 --> 6652.88
and i had like real

6649.84 --> 6655.76
like nervous periods where i was just

6652.88 --> 6657.04
really miserable i felt so poor like

6655.76 --> 6661.1990000000005
that's the feeling like you could

6657.04 --> 6663.28
literally just suddenly fade and die

6661.199 --> 6666.0
that's what that feels like to be really

6663.28 --> 6668.96
[ __ ] poor and not really be able to

6666.0 --> 6670.96
do anything about it

6668.96 --> 6673.04
and i really don't like that sensation

6670.96 --> 6674.88
and i don't want it back because despite

6673.04 --> 6677.84
everything i've been doing pretty well i

6674.88 --> 6680.2390000000005
think i've been growing in my output my

6677.84 --> 6683.679
confidence in my skill and my knowledge

6680.239 --> 6686.959999999999
in my social interaction ability in many

6683.679 --> 6690.08
many ways i deserve this i deserve this

6686.96 --> 6691.52
support i've been working to get it so

6690.08 --> 6694.719
please

6691.52 --> 6697.52
please actually do support me

6694.719 --> 6697.52
that would be

6698.56 --> 6702.2390000000005
just that would make it work

6703.84 --> 6708.08
[Music]

6706.239 --> 6710.799999999999
i know that tobacco is what's bad for me

6708.08 --> 6713.5199999999995
i and i agree and i would love to

6710.8 --> 6716.0
be able to at some point order again

6713.52 --> 6717.92
like raw tobacco leaves from the america

6716.0 --> 6720.48
like i've done before

6717.92 --> 6722.4800000000005
because it's actually cheaper but you

6720.48 --> 6724.4
got to have like an initial investment

6722.48 --> 6727.678999999999
and then wait a while

6724.4 --> 6729.199
and i don't have that kind of

6727.679 --> 6731.52
stash

6729.199 --> 6732.799999999999
to spend like that

6731.52 --> 6735.9890000000005
so

6732.8 --> 6735.9890000000005
[Music]

6737.28 --> 6742.159
great show even with the yelling yeah

6739.28 --> 6744.88
yelling is part of what i do

6742.159 --> 6747.839999999999
right and i do it it just sounds weird

6744.88 --> 6751.04
but i do it also to build skill

6747.84 --> 6753.119000000001
because if you never yell and you then

6751.04 --> 6755.36
get in a tight situation where you're

6753.119 --> 6756.88
squeezed and you're gonna go nuts then

6755.36 --> 6758.799999999999
you're gonna go nuts and you're just

6756.88 --> 6761.52
gonna sound like a freaking insane

6758.8 --> 6763.52
person that's like not thinking straight

6761.52 --> 6767.1990000000005
doing very stupid things

6763.52 --> 6769.679
well if you actually utilize that energy

6767.199 --> 6771.04
more readily more easily yeah at first

6769.679 --> 6771.84
you're going to seem like a bit of a

6771.04 --> 6774.8
dick

6771.84 --> 6776.8
over exaggerated angry

6774.8 --> 6779.4400000000005
and then

6776.8 --> 6781.679
eventually people get used to like oh

6779.44 --> 6784.4
that's actually a part of his character

6781.679 --> 6787.36
that's of how he is

6784.4 --> 6789.44
and then suddenly you can

6787.36 --> 6791.44
grow to become

6789.44 --> 6793.759999999999
eloquent with it

6791.44 --> 6795.36
and not be out of control so much to

6793.76 --> 6798.2390000000005
have the energy

6795.36 --> 6800.48
not losing your mind

6798.239 --> 6804.718999999999
and that's what i've been effectively

6800.48 --> 6808.32
trying to train in the last three years

6804.719 --> 6811.52
i basically the initiator was episode 82

6808.32 --> 6813.36
when i completely went berserk that was

6811.52 --> 6817.119000000001
like here it is

6813.36 --> 6818.799999999999
completely raw completely insane

6817.119 --> 6822.159
that's when it started that's when i

6818.8 --> 6824.159000000001
came out for a rage

6822.159 --> 6826.4
for that being a part of me

6824.159 --> 6829.04
and legitimizing it saying like no that

6826.4 --> 6831.28
doesn't make me bad it's a part of who i

6829.04 --> 6833.119
am of how i deal with things and i'm

6831.28 --> 6834.88
gonna build it i'm not just gonna do the

6833.119 --> 6837.598999999999
same thing over and over again and be

6834.88 --> 6840.2390000000005
hysterical about it i'm gonna actually

6837.599 --> 6842.96
learn to harness it

6840.239 --> 6845.759999999999
and turn it from a wild beast

6842.96 --> 6850.08
into a war beast

6845.76 --> 6852.719
into a refined weapon that a social

6850.08 --> 6854.5599999999995
psychological weapon that i can wield

6852.719 --> 6856.08
and wield better and better and better

6854.56 --> 6857.1990000000005
it's going to be intimidating to a whole

6856.08 --> 6859.5199999999995
bunch of people and it's going to

6857.199 --> 6861.839999999999
isolate me even even within my own

6859.52 --> 6865.1990000000005
friend circles because of the way i am

6861.84 --> 6865.1990000000005
but it's all worth it
