328.479 --> 334.15999999999997

332.84 --> 338.67999999999995
Benjamin

334.16 --> 338.68
so I didn't really catch most of

341.0 --> 345.58
that like Brian was giving another

343.759 --> 348.769
presentation looked pretty

345.58 --> 348.769
[Music]

358.479 --> 361.479
good

364.08 --> 368.84
om Benjamin was was

366.52 --> 370.71999999999997
funny I yeah I don't remember the

368.84 --> 374.31899999999996
details but it was

370.72 --> 377.59900000000005
funny maybe somebody can

374.319 --> 382.28000000000003
uh that also watch it

377.599 --> 385.599
can bring it up or not we'll

382.28 --> 388.11999999999995
see right but yeah I've been still

385.599 --> 390.68
having some difficult

388.12 --> 393.16
time with what I'm just going to call

390.68 --> 393.16
psychic

396.72 --> 403.03900000000004
instability right I am eating though

399.319 --> 405.91900000000004
like I had a full dinner yesterday so

403.039 --> 408.12
that's better I do feel stronger but I

405.919 --> 410.88
mean it was like very uncomfortable

408.12 --> 411.72
though at times I still like have these

410.88 --> 414.52
sort

411.72 --> 418.0
of panic attacks it's just not really

414.52 --> 420.84
full-blown fear it's just like well I

418.0 --> 422.919
just call it instability

420.84 --> 425.96
and that's a condition that

422.919 --> 426.75899999999996
unfortunately I do tend to get every now

425.96 --> 429.23999999999995
and

426.759 --> 433.039
then I'm learning to deal with it better

429.24 --> 436.84000000000003
and better so I had a conversation with

433.039 --> 440.08
my social worker who like

436.84 --> 443.71999999999997
yeah reminded me that like years ago I

440.08 --> 446.84
had it like much

443.72 --> 450.8
longer like this situation because now

446.84 --> 453.44
I'm like ah oh is this going to ever end

450.8 --> 458.319
but I'm pretty damn sure it will and

453.44 --> 459.68
like is it now 6 years ago I had it like

458.319 --> 462.91900000000004
a

459.68 --> 465.96
lot but I still completely hit

462.919 --> 468.75899999999996
it like I didn't show any of it like on

465.96 --> 471.4
my flat Earth talks or

468.759 --> 472.36
anything now I'm much more open about

471.4 --> 474.19899999999996
all these

472.36 --> 477.159
things and

474.199 --> 478.159
honest so yeah and I feel that's

477.159 --> 480.319
possible

478.159 --> 485.71999999999997
even right

480.319 --> 487.8
right but yeah I'm I'm managing and also

485.72 --> 491.24
like to remind you I'm very happy with

487.8 --> 493.039
the show how my show has been going and

491.24 --> 495.96000000000004
there all the new guys in the chat I

493.039 --> 495.96
really appreciate

499.52 --> 505.71999999999997
you thank you for your understanding and

502.4 --> 505.71999999999997
your interest and your

505.759 --> 510.28000000000003
support and not not even like

508.159 --> 514.039
financially I mean I'm very thankful for

510.28 --> 514.039
that but it's also

514.2 --> 522.76
just mostly you guys understanding and

518.519 --> 527.04
just yeah anything right so

522.76 --> 529.56
yeah I just I have this on one side I

527.04 --> 531.04
feel like oh my God everything is might

529.56 --> 534.2399999999999
go wrong

531.04 --> 536.0799999999999
and I might go nuts or something but at

534.24 --> 538.8
the same time like I really feel the

536.08 --> 539.8000000000001
need to just Express maybe almost like

538.8 --> 541.68
it's my

539.8 --> 543.76
like I might not have another chance or

541.68 --> 546.519
something I just want to let everybody

543.76 --> 549.16
know that I'm really thankful I'm so

546.519 --> 549.16
thankful for

550.6 --> 554.12
everything and I mean

555.519 --> 563.12
it anyway

558.44 --> 563.12
right but uh yeah let's settle down

563.24 --> 567.519
and see what we can talk about

567.68 --> 572.76
today right but yeah with the psychic

570.519 --> 575.72
instability that I experience when

572.76 --> 577.56
that's like in full force there's like

575.72 --> 579.519
weird aberant

577.56 --> 581.959
communicative

579.519 --> 583.32
dislocation where I just continually

581.959 --> 585.5189999999999
feel

583.32 --> 589.0
like I

585.519 --> 591.079
don't like I'm not understanding things

589.0 --> 595.0
like I am not understanding the feeling

591.079 --> 597.92
of things I can rationalize things and I

595.0 --> 599.88
can basically like decipher what it

597.92 --> 601.92
could mean it's just let my feelings

599.88 --> 605.88
just they're

601.92 --> 608.5999999999999
not there's other weird ideas that are

605.88 --> 608.6
like

609.839 --> 615.44
competing and I like can't really per

613.16 --> 618.24
like I can't find the rest enough to

615.44 --> 620.48
like make up my mind about what's real

618.24 --> 622.6
almost and that's like very

620.48 --> 624.839
uncomfortable that makes me very nervous

622.6 --> 628.0400000000001
and that is the the factor that then

624.839 --> 630.399
ends up haunting me

628.04 --> 633.36
so

630.399 --> 636.88
I really could drive without glasses the

633.36 --> 640.88
sunset is challenging okay sck hello

636.88 --> 640.88
clutch good see you and carrots of

644.0 --> 649.48
fire that was funny before the show

647.279 --> 653.4399999999999
before I went to the appointment I was

649.48 --> 657.6800000000001
also watching like um Mark sergeant and

653.44 --> 662.399
Karen B on Mark Sergeant Channel and she

657.68 --> 664.279
said that like gazing in the sun like

662.399 --> 667.279
during sunset and

664.279 --> 670.88
sunrise helped her eyesight to get rid

667.279 --> 673.519
of glasses that was very

670.88 --> 677.24
interesting so this might be like

673.519 --> 677.24
another way besides ey

678.48 --> 684.32
yoga and yeah but in a way that that I

682.44 --> 686.2790000000001
have experienced something about I have

684.32 --> 689.0790000000001
done that I love staring like in the

686.279 --> 690.48
sunset especially Sunrise is not that's

689.079 --> 692.12
a bit more rare for

690.48 --> 696.8000000000001
[Music]

692.12 --> 699.76
me but Sun said yeah like it does like

696.8 --> 703.8
Revitalize my eye nerves or something

699.76 --> 703.8
that system so it was

706.959 --> 713.1199999999999
interesting got to wait till summer to

709.68 --> 713.12
get the Sun up

715.44 --> 719.72
okay

717.12 --> 722.6
yeah yeah the sunrise of course yeah

719.72 --> 722.6
during the winter

725.12 --> 730.9590000000001
it's although during winter it is later

728.04 --> 730.959
in the morning

736.639 --> 743.12
though say eyeball shap that gives

739.92 --> 743.12
bifocal yeah could

747.88 --> 750.88
be

759.72 --> 763.88
right yeah I mean if it's that then

762.04 --> 768.04
maybe there isn't

763.88 --> 771.04
anything like I yoga or sun gazing that

768.04 --> 771.04
might help I'm not sure

777.839 --> 780.839
Silla

795.72 --> 800.32
right

797.04 --> 805.279
anyhow I'm going to put my Illuminati C

800.32 --> 805.279
in the open I'm really hungry be right

807.76 --> 810.76
back

867.68 --> 870.68
w

893.12 --> 896.36
all right sorry I'm

897.279 --> 906.36
back did we overshift and missed OB oh

902.399 --> 909.079
okay still need to figure out D

906.36 --> 911.88
life yeah I heard with people with

909.079 --> 914.4799999999999
mobiles it's like they have trouble

911.88 --> 914.48
getting in

915.32 --> 918.32
there

922.279 --> 926.759
apparently right but you could just

924.6 --> 930.24
follow them you can follow Owen on

926.759 --> 932.6
Rumble too that should be easier I mean

930.24 --> 935.91
they have like more trolls in the chat

932.6 --> 939.76
there but I mean at least it should work

935.91 --> 939.76
[Music]

955.68 --> 961.88
easy oh God yeah yeah the episode yday

958.839 --> 961.8800000000001
was pretty brutal

968.16 --> 973.8
though and hilarious like on one hand

971.44 --> 975.72
it's like Owen is like

973.8 --> 978.5999999999999
basically yeah

975.72 --> 982.0790000000001
he he was like

978.6 --> 985.6
praising the Rothchild guy I forget his

982.079 --> 987.519
name uh who died recently and then

985.6 --> 990.639
compared him to the the guy that

987.519 --> 993.48
allegedly set himself on fire that

990.639 --> 995.639
happened this all all this crazy stuff

993.48 --> 998.279
by the way happened on

995.639 --> 1000.48
Saturday like right when I was having

998.279 --> 1004.24
like the most severe panic attack I've

1000.48 --> 1005.279
experienced in a in a long time that was

1004.24 --> 1009.24
really

1005.279 --> 1012.12
weird that that all happened at the same

1009.24 --> 1014.759
time like it happened with me like in

1012.12 --> 1015.68
the late evening and that's when that

1014.759 --> 1020.48
all

1015.68 --> 1020.4799999999999
happened it's just so weird

1025.52 --> 1032.0
although yeah so Saturday last Saturday

1029.199 --> 1036.48
was a really weird weird

1032.0 --> 1038.16
day Saturday the 24th what a strange

1036.48 --> 1041.439
strange day that

1038.16 --> 1045.64
was in the

1041.439 --> 1045.64
world hey LSG good to see

1047.4 --> 1050.4
you

1057.96 --> 1063.6000000000001
he was praising Russ no yeah no but he

1061.24 --> 1066.08
was like comparing like how he lived and

1063.6 --> 1069.799
how well behaved he really was and all

1066.08 --> 1073.48
that I mean it's just Owen making a

1069.799 --> 1075.6399999999999
surreal case and it was like actually

1073.48 --> 1078.76
convincing and he was just comparing

1075.64 --> 1080.159
like yeah everybody like R child he's

1078.76 --> 1083.28
he's going to

1080.159 --> 1087.2800000000002
Satan and and then at the same time the

1083.28 --> 1088.6399999999999
guy that like set himself on fire to

1087.28 --> 1092.1589999999999
like

1088.64 --> 1095.1200000000001
stop like free Gaza or

1092.159 --> 1098.3200000000002
something I didn't I never even like saw

1095.12 --> 1100.8799999999999
that I just heard it through

1098.32 --> 1102.96
people and everybody was all praising

1100.88 --> 1105.3600000000001
them and Owen explained like yeah but

1102.96 --> 1109.8400000000001
that guy was like what the hell did he

1105.36 --> 1113.039
ever do and like suicide is like a grave

1109.84 --> 1117.6789999999999
sin and I totally agree with that like I

1113.039 --> 1117.679
believe that already at a very young

1117.84 --> 1123.4399999999998
age and cuz you're like yeah you're a

1121.039 --> 1127.679
murderer of somebody that is yourself

1123.44 --> 1131.4
and that's that's bad that God does not

1127.679 --> 1134.039
condone that and like the compli yeah

1131.4 --> 1136.4
the complicatedness of all that he

1134.039 --> 1139.52
explained even like with supposed

1136.4 --> 1141.64
suicide bombers and all that in Islam

1151.88 --> 1157.3600000000001
did feel a little bit unstable so it was

1154.4 --> 1161.64
a bit unnerving just the entire

1157.36 --> 1161.6399999999999
subject like that was all kind of

1163.919 --> 1170.72
unnerving but he also then mentioned ter

1424.159 --> 1426.679
not my

1436.88 --> 1441.48
problem

1439.279 --> 1443.23
yeah I'm not friends with

1441.48 --> 1447.109
trolls I'm just

1443.23 --> 1447.109
[Music]

1456.43 --> 1459.67
[Music]

1466.799 --> 1472.44
not all right so I mean might have his

1470.32 --> 1473.6399999999999
own paranoid delusions right now about a

1472.44 --> 1476.0800000000002
whole bunch of

1473.64 --> 1477.159
things I don't know exactly what it is

1476.08 --> 1480.799
but I

1477.159 --> 1483.0390000000002
mean he's certainly not making himself

1480.799 --> 1486.6
beloved

1483.039 --> 1489.0
and yeah I don't know if he knows what

1486.6 --> 1491.52
the hell he's doing but whatever it is

1489.0 --> 1495.84
you need to stop you need to just move

1491.52 --> 1499.08
on and like do something a little bit

1495.84 --> 1501.76
more positive

1499.08 --> 1501.76
that that's

1504.279 --> 1510.039
it as always been a bit off well maybe I

1508.0 --> 1513.72
mean he had issues even back then it was

1510.039 --> 1518.36
like he had anger issues and over high

1513.72 --> 1520.88
tension Etc like but it was like doable

1518.36 --> 1522.76
as long as he was like willing to to

1520.88 --> 1524.64
deal with it and to face it and to work

1522.76 --> 1525.84
on it and he was doing that for a whole

1524.64 --> 1528.24
long

1525.84 --> 1531.799
time and then the

1528.24 --> 1531.799
subject came up and he just

1534.88 --> 1541.2
flipped even though technically I never

1537.88 --> 1544.72
attacked him or even I really tried to

1541.2 --> 1548.279
avoid being insulting in any every

1544.72 --> 1549.3600000000001
way I was just curious about things but

1548.279 --> 1553.279
yeah he

1549.36 --> 1555.1589999999999
wasn't he couldn't deal with it so hey

1553.279 --> 1557.399
I'm I'm retracting that I don't need to

1555.159 --> 1560.64
know about that [ __ ] anymore don't worry

1557.399 --> 1563.0
about it I'll leave you alone man you

1560.64 --> 1564.919
can think about your country and

1563.0 --> 1566.919
everything exactly what you want and you

1564.919 --> 1570.5200000000002
can see it exactly how you want and

1566.919 --> 1572.8400000000001
that's all fine with me yeah I'm not

1570.52 --> 1574.24
going to bother you about that or

1572.84 --> 1577.9189999999999
anything about

1574.24 --> 1579.96
that but yeah I at the same time don't

1577.919 --> 1585.679
really want you around here anymore

1579.96 --> 1585.679
because you hung around with like nasty

1586.6 --> 1589.6
trolls

1592.279 --> 1597.679
right and at some point certain depths

1595.0 --> 1601.279
that it just don't want you back there's

1597.679 --> 1604.3600000000001
other troll people that also seem to be

1601.279 --> 1607.12
fans or whatever but every time they

1604.36 --> 1609.12
speak they say something that's nasty I

1607.12 --> 1612.1999999999998
just don't want them around I don't care

1609.12 --> 1614.2399999999998
if they like me yeah just because

1612.2 --> 1616.6000000000001
somebody likes me that doesn't mean that

1614.24 --> 1619.6
I then have to like

1616.6 --> 1619.6
you

1620.24 --> 1622.88
I'm kind of

1624.679 --> 1627.679

1711.559 --> 1716.32
much

1713.159 --> 1720.159
yes and the cricket but I mean that's

1716.32 --> 1721.6
just his his hobby or whatever so the

1720.159 --> 1723.88
cricket could have been annoying a

1721.6 --> 1725.84
little bit I didn't mind that too much I

1723.88 --> 1729.48
mean I definitely not going to tolerate

1725.84 --> 1731.4399999999998
that now of course it was just like yeah

1729.48 --> 1734.76
that comes with the guy whatever he

1731.44 --> 1734.76
likes to talk about that

1735.399 --> 1743.279
fine right and concerning the power like

1739.679 --> 1743.279
yeah I had to like

1743.48 --> 1748.72
okay not really working out too

1746.64 --> 1751.88
much so I

1748.72 --> 1754.919
mean yeah it's it's all just what it is

1751.88 --> 1754.919
man I did my

1755.72 --> 1760.08
best and it's just ended sometimes

1758.64 --> 1763.5590000000002
things just

1760.08 --> 1763.559
end they just

1765.14 --> 1769.3200000000002
[Music]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
end

1771.039 --> 1774.799
would be good to know the warning signs

1772.88 --> 1777.7990000000002
to spot any future

1774.799 --> 1777.799
transgressions

1780.24 --> 1788.48
what clear yeah clear and clear is not

1784.44 --> 1790.919
entirely out out in the clearing Zone

1788.48 --> 1795.48
either yeah we've had issues I've had

1790.919 --> 1795.48
issues with clear but I mean it's all

1796.32 --> 1801.6
about

1798.159 --> 1803.44
just can you let it go that's really

1801.6 --> 1805.9189999999999
what it's mostly about it's all about

1803.44 --> 1810.519
just being able to let it

1805.919 --> 1813.919
go eventually I let it go I give most

1810.519 --> 1816.48
people a new chance and then if they

1813.919 --> 1818.76
actually let it go and they just start a

1816.48 --> 1822.0
fresh

1818.76 --> 1826.44
spiritually and not just waiting to get

1822.0 --> 1827.88
a payback kind of thing then it's cool

1826.44 --> 1831.559
you have to act

1827.88 --> 1834.44
Let It Go I let it go but it doesn't

1831.559 --> 1834.44
work if the other

1837.159 --> 1842.1200000000001
doesn't yeah I'm not going to let it go

1839.6 --> 1843.6399999999999
so and let somebody in when they're not

1842.12 --> 1847.7199999999998
letting it go and they're never going to

1843.64 --> 1851.64
stop nagging about it or just think they

1847.72 --> 1855.159
have the right to nag at me you

1851.64 --> 1859.2
don't pretty much no matter what you

1855.159 --> 1863.3990000000001
have a right to make a a an honest

1859.2 --> 1863.3990000000001
complaint but not the nag about

1863.96 --> 1871.44
it right and when it's honest then I

1867.72 --> 1874.76
will address it I like I compulsively

1871.44 --> 1874.76
address things like

1886.159 --> 1889.159
that

1890.84 --> 1895.48
yeah some of us have redeeming qualities

1892.88 --> 1899.48
and not so redeeming quality yes it's

1895.48 --> 1902.24
always a mix it's always a mix with most

1899.48 --> 1906.08
people right even like if somebody has a

1902.24 --> 1909.32
real peak talent in a way then that Peak

1906.08 --> 1909.32
Talent is also their

1909.639 --> 1916.1589999999999
flaw at other times it's that's how it

1913.2 --> 1917.27
works everything has ups and downs every

1916.159 --> 1920.279
person

1917.27 --> 1922.2
[Music]

1920.279 --> 1926.48
and that's okay that's fine I never

1922.2 --> 1929.8400000000001
expected anybody to be absolutely

1926.48 --> 1933.6390000000001
perfect but there are certain lines that

1929.84 --> 1936.32
just I won't tolerate being crossed and

1933.639 --> 1939.4399999999998
I'm being very open about it and I have

1936.32 --> 1939.4399999999998
been for quite a

1941.6 --> 1947.6
while right and I mean like even clutch

1944.44 --> 1952.0
in me like clutch was really pissed off

1947.6 --> 1957.0
at me at some point and probably because

1952.0 --> 1960.0
I was like out ra being raging

1957.0 --> 1960.0
unreasonably

1962.08 --> 1969.1589999999999
right I am like totally cool with it

1965.559 --> 1972.519
like I know that those things

1969.159 --> 1974.48
happen like if you're around me there

1972.519 --> 1976.279
are times where I'm going to get Rowdy

1974.48 --> 1978.039
and you might get like sick of me or

1976.279 --> 1981.6
something

1978.039 --> 1984.36
and I might even be unreasonable in some

1981.6 --> 1986.24
way and then maybe I'll flip around and

1984.36 --> 1987.799
the next day I'll be like oh my God what

1986.24 --> 1991.159
am I doing

1987.799 --> 1992.0
and like why did I say those things like

1991.159 --> 1996.0390000000002
it

1992.0 --> 1996.039
happens it just happens with

1997.399 --> 2005.1589999999999
me and I wish I wouldn't I wish that

2002.0 --> 2007.559
that I didn't do those things but I do

2005.159 --> 2011.7990000000002
and so since

2007.559 --> 2014.6789999999999
I can't prevent it from happening like

2011.799 --> 2017.519
permanently I've just decided okay well

2014.679 --> 2019.3990000000001
I can't stop it then I'll have to like

2017.519 --> 2021.6
really make the best of it and I'll make

2019.399 --> 2023.12
the best of it more than anybody could

2021.6 --> 2027.24
ever

2023.12 --> 2031.2399999999998
imagine like I'll like exploit the error

2027.24 --> 2034.519
that I'm making to the maximum degree

2031.24 --> 2040.96
not through self humiliation or

2034.519 --> 2040.96
whatever but by hyper analysis and

2041.559 --> 2045.8799999999999
constructive like and a constructive

2046.039 --> 2050.639
approach you can be a dick too that's

2050.72 --> 2057.24
fine right I

2053.52 --> 2060.119
mean everybody can well some people have

2057.24 --> 2061.879
dickish moods and then I bump into you

2060.119 --> 2063.76
like how dare you or whatever

2061.879 --> 2065.0
metaphorically I would never say that

2063.76 --> 2068.32
like

2065.0 --> 2071.639
that and then you explode and it's like

2068.32 --> 2073.56
yeah like even with the guy aam doesn't

2071.639 --> 2075.359
really come here that much anymore he

2073.56 --> 2078.839
used to he used to have that all the

2075.359 --> 2081.7599999999998
time and it always be like yeah you just

2078.839 --> 2083.7999999999997
go back to normal and you don't and you

2081.76 --> 2086.8390000000004
let it go you actually let it go you're

2083.8 --> 2086.8390000000004
like you can be

2087.48 --> 2090.48
back

2091.44 --> 2097.359
right so yeah ironically I I have

2094.28 --> 2101.3590000000004
hashtag intolerance in my chat but in

2097.359 --> 2104.96
other ways I am actually extremely

2101.359 --> 2104.96
tolerant it's just

2105.16 --> 2112.24
that I'm extremely tolerant on the long

2108.079 --> 2114.119
run because I have to be it's like if

2112.24 --> 2116.3999999999996
you're just intolerant to everything

2114.119 --> 2118.7200000000003
you'll just get completely isolated and

2116.4 --> 2121.0
then there's nothing left to do you

2118.72 --> 2123.2799999999997
basically just become enemies with

2121.0 --> 2125.8
everything and that's terrible

2123.28 --> 2128.8
predicament that's totally

2125.8 --> 2128.8
unproductive

2129.119 --> 2134.119
right so my point is is that I've had

2132.2 --> 2137.4399999999996
arguments with a lot of

2134.119 --> 2141.079
you and I've like really rubbed some of

2137.44 --> 2145.16
you the wrong way at certain times and I

2141.079 --> 2149.04
do apologize not necessarily for how I

2145.16 --> 2149.04
did it but that that

2155.4 --> 2162.48
happened and I mean it I'm a

2159.359 --> 2166.04
handful with my emotions yeah and hey I

2162.48 --> 2168.0
say it you know I am

2166.04 --> 2170.88
mentally really

2168.0 --> 2173.8
stable so stable that even during the

2170.88 --> 2176.319
most extreme panic attacks like I can

2173.8 --> 2178.6800000000003
absolutely analyze exactly what is

2176.319 --> 2181.359
happening and explain it to somebody at

2178.68 --> 2184.3999999999996
a high intellectual level that they can

2181.359 --> 2187.16
really understand and even reference it

2184.4 --> 2189.04
Etc and present it in the stable fashion

2187.16 --> 2191.44
that even though it is very complicated

2189.04 --> 2193.839
I can make it very understood yeah

2191.44 --> 2198.319
that's how much mental stability I have

2193.839 --> 2201.72
it's like undefeatable stability but

2198.319 --> 2204.359
emotionally like yeah I have issues my

2201.72 --> 2204.359
emotions get

2206.319 --> 2210.2799999999997

3837.96 --> 3842.4
and I'll get a bit more bright and a bit

3840.2 --> 3846.24
more Rowdy and

3842.4 --> 3846.2400000000002
everything when I get back to

3849.44 --> 3853.92
normal and more

3851.559 --> 3856.599
curious because it does also like

3853.92 --> 3857.88
distract away from my typical curiosity

3856.599 --> 3860.2400000000002
that I might

3857.88 --> 3864.76
have if I'm dealing with ATT tension

3860.24 --> 3866.72
then I just can't dig as much the

3864.76 --> 3868.2000000000003
process of digging is like it doesn't

3866.72 --> 3871.279
really work that well

3868.2 --> 3873.5589999999997
because my instinct tells me like no

3871.279 --> 3876.24
don't dig you'll find trouble you can't

3873.559 --> 3876.2400000000002
handle that right

3879.96 --> 3886.039
now right but I mean still talk about

3883.079 --> 3886.039
stuff don't worry about

3893.16 --> 3896.16
it

3920.24 --> 3926.0789999999997
what what jlew what are you talking

3923.079 --> 3926.079
about

3939.2 --> 3942.279
joke I don't get it

3953.079 --> 3956.079
though

3975.279 --> 3981.279
okay gentle bear I don't think that

3978.079 --> 3981.279
would be classified

3983.0 --> 3986.0
though

4013.0 --> 4016.0
for

4023.68 --> 4027.319
what okay

4042.92 --> 4045.92
okay

4048.079 --> 4050.6400000000003
hey Gavin

4070.33 --> 4075.92
[Music]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
B

4102.839 --> 4105.839
oh

4127.01 --> 4130.369000000001
[Music]

4144.4 --> 4146.839
uh

4158.359 --> 4162.1990000000005
no nobody knows

4162.56 --> 4166.759
him yeah yeah well I know very little

4165.12 --> 4170.4
about him I

4166.759 --> 4173.08
mean it's I'm really agitated over all

4170.4 --> 4176.3589999999995
of this because in all that time he was

4173.08 --> 4178.719
here he's never donated to me one

4176.359 --> 4181.04
time I don't know what he looks like

4178.719 --> 4183.6
he's never shown himself and now he's

4181.04 --> 4183.6
doing all

4185.839 --> 4192.719
this so it just like it really does feel

4190.12 --> 4194.239
like he was a troll all the

4192.719 --> 4197.08
time

4194.239 --> 4199.199
and he was just like being all cozy just

4197.08 --> 4201.36
to get close so he could like rage out

4199.199 --> 4203.5199999999995
on us I mean it does feel like that at

4201.36 --> 4203.5199999999995
this

4204.12 --> 4208.159
point okay I gave him all this patience

4207.12 --> 4209.719
and all

4208.159 --> 4212.799999999999
this

4209.719 --> 4216.08
friendship and a wrench and everything

4212.8 --> 4219.08
and I literally never got one

4216.08 --> 4219.08
scent

4222.64 --> 4225.64
ever

4259.199 --> 4264.28
yet the gentle bear he wasn't responding

4262.159 --> 4266.599999999999
to you he was

4264.28 --> 4270.08
responding to a

4266.6 --> 4272.320000000001
troll various Vogons who said something

4270.08 --> 4272.32
really

4273.679 --> 4278.36
nasty don't think he was responding to

4276.04 --> 4278.36
you

4282.56 --> 4287.400000000001
there what I thinking long-term troll

4285.239 --> 4289.959999999999
yeah it might be maybe he was like the

4287.4 --> 4289.96
big

4291.92 --> 4296.92
one I don't know he probably thinks of

4295.12 --> 4298.4
him maybe like that I don't know what

4296.92 --> 4302.0
the hell he's thinking

4298.4 --> 4305.36
anymore what there a credit card that's

4302.0 --> 4305.36
why okay

4309.12 --> 4315.5599999999995
what

4312.08 --> 4315.5599999999995
uh what

4319.679 --> 4324.12
what don't worry about it I wasn't like

4321.56 --> 4326.84
talking about

4324.12 --> 4330.04
you you're not the one that's like

4326.84 --> 4330.04
trolling me all of a

4334.199 --> 4338.36
sudden I don't even know you that

4342.48 --> 4345.48
long

4372.44 --> 4375.44
wow

4403.08 --> 4408.08
might the overnight Ry flip yeah it kind

4405.84 --> 4408.08
of

4409.679 --> 4415.159
does

4412.159 --> 4415.159
neutr

4432.36 --> 4435.36
yeah

4462.28 --> 4469.679
e yeah so it's all weird I don't like it

4466.4 --> 4472.4
it's it does seem like just a bunch of

4469.679 --> 4476.36
psychos out

4472.4 --> 4479.5199999999995
there that are like really making people

4476.36 --> 4482.04
just to like yeah send after us and do

4479.52 --> 4482.040000000001
that sort of

4486.92 --> 4493.36
[ __ ] it all seems pretty damn

4489.84 --> 4495.96
satanic I mean it does it it just they

4493.36 --> 4499.839999999999
overall feel of it is like santic it's

4495.96 --> 4499.84
like really nasty

4500.4 --> 4505.839999999999
people like drunk they get in and they

4503.199 --> 4507.4
just want to destroy it and they like

4505.84 --> 4511.6
want to destroy it from the start but

4507.4 --> 4514.199
maybe when they get in they kind of like

4511.6 --> 4516.639
accidentally G regain a little bit of

4514.199 --> 4518.5199999999995
their original normal Consciousness and

4516.639 --> 4520.76
they're like oh hey we can be friends

4518.52 --> 4522.679
and then eventually things go wrong and

4520.76 --> 4527.4400000000005
they revert back to the program what

4522.679 --> 4527.4400000000005
they where they really came for to

4529.56 --> 4536.0
destroy it's starting to feel to me like

4532.36 --> 4539.799999999999
that like a lot of people that have had

4536.0 --> 4542.08
hassle here like that that they that

4539.8 --> 4544.4400000000005
they were really my enemy from the start

4542.08 --> 4547.04
they just they just try to make friends

4544.44 --> 4547.04
just to do

4548.92 --> 4551.92
that

4552.199 --> 4560.5199999999995
right like to make me feel like it's all

4556.92 --> 4562.8
my fault somehow driving up the tension

4560.52 --> 4565.8
then I get angry I say something that

4562.8 --> 4567.400000000001
might be seen as insulting in some way

4565.8 --> 4568.96
and then they're just like oh now I'm

4567.4 --> 4569.839999999999
going to absolutely destroy your life

4568.96 --> 4571.92
with

4569.84 --> 4573.12
everything I'm going to say all the

4571.92 --> 4576.0
things that you don't want to hear I'm

4573.12 --> 4579.0
going to tell everybody uh

4576.0 --> 4579.0
like

4580.639 --> 4586.1990000000005
yeah if I'd actually set out to like

4584.12 --> 4587.679
have a friendship with anybody

4586.199 --> 4591.36
especially

4587.679 --> 4594.8
online like I would literally never ever

4591.36 --> 4596.96
under any circumstance do that like even

4594.8 --> 4599.12
if they like attempted to kill me or

4596.96 --> 4602.0
something like even then I just like

4599.12 --> 4606.199
okay I'll just walk away then I mean

4602.0 --> 4609.04
it's crazy it's I it's surreal to me all

4606.199 --> 4615.08
that behavior is completely surreal to

4609.04 --> 4615.08
me like I can't even imagine doing that

4617.4 --> 4620.599999999999
all right anyway I'm going to get my

4642.0 --> 4645.0
tea

4690.88 --> 4696.12
com to rent a house like AR uh

4701.92 --> 4706.12
okay

4704.44 --> 4709.5199999999995
didn't really have anything to do with

4706.12 --> 4712.639
confidence though I just didn't have a

4709.52 --> 4716.4800000000005
choice and I'm not renting a house it's

4712.639 --> 4716.4800000000005
just one room in a

4731.92 --> 4734.92
house

4744.239 --> 4749.48
what 291 Jump Street types what does

4747.28 --> 4749.48
that

4756.4 --> 4762.44
mean literally like just a troll yes

4759.679 --> 4764.4400000000005
slowmo I tried to tune in like once I

4762.44 --> 4767.159
notic that I noticed that not even

4764.44 --> 4771.919999999999
anybody normal was in the chat there so

4767.159 --> 4771.92
I just left again absolutely

4791.84 --> 4794.84
ridiculous

4809.0 --> 4814.159
right so let me just say that this is

4812.08 --> 4815.4
provably going to kill their viewing

4814.159 --> 4819.32
numbers

4815.4 --> 4820.32
then I mean that seems kind of blatant

4819.32 --> 4824.04
at this

4820.32 --> 4827.32
point it's up to them

4824.04 --> 4829.679
unless it's like oh my God just seeing

4827.32 --> 4832.239
just seeing me still continuing and

4829.679 --> 4834.76
having you guys here and we just talk

4832.239 --> 4837.759999999999
and have a good time maybe that's all

4834.76 --> 4841.4800000000005
become so subconsciously

4837.76 --> 4844.0
intolerable to all of them that they're

4841.48 --> 4846.599999999999
like no no we need the trolls in here

4844.0 --> 4849.44
just so that we just don't get to see

4846.6 --> 4849.4400000000005
them ever

4850.199 --> 4857.12
again almost like they made a deal with

4852.48 --> 4857.12
a trolls or something it's it's just so

4857.199 --> 4863.799999999999
weird I don't get it I really don't get

4860.08 --> 4868.8
it and that's started some time

4863.8 --> 4868.8
ago I mean did they like get a

4868.88 --> 4877.28
notice from from like a judge like uh

4873.04 --> 4879.48
somebody is like you're like you cannot

4877.28 --> 4882.0
delete any more trolls in the chat or

4879.48 --> 4883.159
you'll like get a fine or something like

4882.0 --> 4886.12
all like

4883.159 --> 4889.799999999999
what what I don't even know what

4886.12 --> 4891.84
else how else to make any sense of that

4889.8 --> 4895.2390000000005
like I don't understand why they're

4891.84 --> 4898.96
doing what they're doing at all like at

4895.239 --> 4902.08
all it it just makes no more sense it's

4898.96 --> 4903.52
like they're all just freaking possessed

4902.08 --> 4908.6
with the

4903.52 --> 4908.6
devil just overtly at this

4911.639 --> 4914.639
point

4915.84 --> 4920.04
not saying that they are but I mean I

4918.0 --> 4923.679
just don't know how to make any kind of

4920.04 --> 4923.679
sense of what is going on there

4941.56 --> 4944.56
anymore

4963.4 --> 4970.92
yeah me too clear I mean and I hope that

4966.159 --> 4974.719
you guys can keep finding that here

4970.92 --> 4976.719
right it it is really really strange to

4974.719 --> 4978.639
all of a sudden just get this feeling

4976.719 --> 4981.96
and that you guys are feeling it too

4978.639 --> 4984.96
like is my show now like the last place

4981.96 --> 4989.52
that's still like somewhat

4984.96 --> 4989.52
sane is that really happening

4990.199 --> 4996.5199999999995
now is my chat like the last safe space

4993.719 --> 4999.76
for sane people on the Internet or

4996.52 --> 5002.080000000001
something it's just really

4999.76 --> 5005.1990000000005
freaky the way things are going out

5002.08 --> 5006.5199999999995
there like I don't understand like I

5005.199 --> 5009.44
just don't

5006.52 --> 5012.120000000001
get what the hell they think they're

5009.44 --> 5016.12
doing and I mean it's not business it's

5012.12 --> 5020.08
your freaking videos it's your audience

5016.12 --> 5022.92
it's it's your YouTube but I just I'm

5020.08 --> 5026.08
baffled about what you're

5022.92 --> 5027.679
doing and it seems self-destructive

5026.08 --> 5031.199
that's literally doesn't have

5027.679 --> 5033.76
consequences for me other than just it's

5031.199 --> 5037.0
annoying and it's painful probably

5033.76 --> 5040.8
bullying and all that but all of this is

5037.0 --> 5043.04
just way more damaging to you guys

5040.8 --> 5048.56
you're the ones doing

5043.04 --> 5048.56
this you're the ones letting the nasty

5052.52 --> 5059.719
loose yeah I mean I

5056.4 --> 5061.32
guarantee I give you arnian guarantee

5059.719 --> 5064.12
you probably don't care about that at

5061.32 --> 5066.32
all but I give you wi guarantee like you

5064.12 --> 5068.5599999999995
let those people just keep washing over

5066.32 --> 5070.5199999999995
the place you're not going to get any

5068.56 --> 5074.320000000001
new

5070.52 --> 5076.1990000000005
people they're all going to go away

5074.32 --> 5079.0
eventually and you'll be like a

5076.199 --> 5079.0
shriveled

5081.48 --> 5085.08
Relic and I don't want that for Flat

5084.08 --> 5087.84
Earth

5085.08 --> 5089.679
debates I think that we've come very far

5087.84 --> 5092.4800000000005
there's been so many developments and

5089.679 --> 5095.4
there's still even room for more I mean

5092.48 --> 5097.919999999999
Brian's like seems to be like in a

5095.4 --> 5100.879999999999
golden age period for himself like

5097.92 --> 5103.719
really figuring things out and

5100.88 --> 5105.84
like not it's any of my business but I

5103.719 --> 5110.32
think that he's like doing better than

5105.84 --> 5110.32
he was doing a year ago it's very

5111.4 --> 5116.48
impressive and I like I like that I I

5114.4 --> 5120.04
like that he's doing well I'm I'm very

5116.48 --> 5122.959999999999
happy for him whether he feels that

5120.04 --> 5124.4
reciprocal or anything

5122.96 --> 5127.28
it's just

5124.4 --> 5130.92
that I don't understand what the hell is

5127.28 --> 5130.92
happening with the collective of

5133.199 --> 5138.5199999999995
it I just don't understand it anymore

5136.159 --> 5140.759999999999
and even the confrontation that I had to

5138.52 --> 5142.8
think about you just think about what

5140.76 --> 5145.6
you need to say yeah well I think

5142.8 --> 5148.84
thought about it for two days now and I

5145.6 --> 5152.360000000001
absolutely just have no

5148.84 --> 5154.159000000001
clue it makes me kind of paranoid May me

5152.36 --> 5157.08
think that you're like expecting me to

5154.159 --> 5160.5199999999995
just fall on my sword literally or

5157.08 --> 5164.6
something I I just just I can't make any

5160.52 --> 5167.76
sense of it not one single piece of dust

5164.6 --> 5170.0
not one grain of sand like I don't

5167.76 --> 5173.1990000000005
understand what the [ __ ] is going on

5170.0 --> 5175.239
here there I just don't and I will have

5173.199 --> 5178.4
absolutely no other choice but to like

5175.239 --> 5181.839999999999
stay away because I can't just go and

5178.4 --> 5184.879999999999
join people that tell me things that I

5181.84 --> 5187.08
don't understand and then they refuse to

5184.88 --> 5189.159000000001
explain it makes me feel like they're

5187.08 --> 5192.08
gaslighting me

5189.159 --> 5194.96
somehow and I'm not going to endure that

5192.08 --> 5198.119
especially when I'm

5194.96 --> 5201.639
instable emotionally instable

5198.119 --> 5204.5199999999995
that's this just there's no way this in

5201.639 --> 5207.08
this what do you call that it's not a

5204.52 --> 5207.080000000001
durable

5207.56 --> 5213.88
scenario and besides I don't need it I

5211.88 --> 5215.28
got my own channel my own channel is

5213.88 --> 5220.119
going

5215.28 --> 5220.119
great right Gavin B you were

5232.48 --> 5237.199
saying [ __ ] don't give a [ __ ] or

5235.08 --> 5240.92
they got instructions never to ban

5237.199 --> 5240.919999999999
trolls slow M moon

5241.119 --> 5244.119
buggy

5249.239 --> 5253.959999999999
I don't know somebody ordered them or

5251.4 --> 5256.4
something maybe just M6 came up there

5253.96 --> 5259.719
like yeah you have to give your you have

5256.4 --> 5262.28
to make your chats available as a safe

5259.719 --> 5264.88
space for people that hate Arwin and

5262.28 --> 5267.159
want to rant on about him so you can't

5264.88 --> 5267.159000000001
stop

5267.44 --> 5272.678999999999
him I mean I don't know why else anybody

5271.56 --> 5278.719
would do that

5272.679 --> 5278.719
that it's all just totally bizarre to

5279.12 --> 5282.17
[Music]

5301.04 --> 5304.04
me

5325.639 --> 5330.159000000001
are you viewing numbers dropping

5327.4 --> 5335.48
drastically on this channel I don't know

5330.159 --> 5338.759999999999
gentle bear I I'm not super aware of the

5335.48 --> 5341.08
stats about

5338.76 --> 5343.639
them I'm

5341.08 --> 5347.199
not I just know that my channel is

5343.639 --> 5347.1990000000005
actually doing way better

5348.719 --> 5355.76
now it is getting more views more live

5356.6 --> 5363.92
participants and actually on average

5359.36 --> 5363.92
less trolls to deal with

5379.28 --> 5384.48
even my subscribers are like kind of

5381.48 --> 5384.48
steadily growing

5385.52 --> 5393.080000000001
again right I'm at

5388.32 --> 5397.4
2868 right now I mean yeah

5393.08 --> 5397.4
it's been stuck for like a year or

5403.719 --> 5407.0
more it's

5407.92 --> 5414.08
just I I don't know if you guys can tell

5410.679 --> 5417.0
in the chat but like I am genuinely

5414.08 --> 5418.88
bewildered by this entire situation like

5417.0 --> 5420.96
I'm like I don't know what to think

5418.88 --> 5423.679
about like not that I'm like oh I'm

5420.96 --> 5426.96
conflicted I'm just like genuinely

5423.679 --> 5429.4400000000005
surprised here like why the hell is this

5426.96 --> 5432.04
happening I don't understand what's

5429.44 --> 5432.04
going on

5442.56 --> 5447.96
here it's like there's whole layers of

5445.6 --> 5450.159000000001
things that I'm completely unaware of

5447.96 --> 5452.8
that may have been happening for a long

5450.159 --> 5456.199
time and that I've stayed completely

5452.8 --> 5459.28
unaware of for a long time and I'm like

5456.199 --> 5461.638999999999
what the hell did I miss I don't

5459.28 --> 5461.639
understand

5469.6 --> 5475.679
this lower views I'm up okay cool Gavin

5480.76 --> 5483.76
B

5495.239 --> 5503.678999999999
what I wouldn't say only kind part one

5499.119 --> 5503.679
of them for sure what what do you

5508.679 --> 5516.119
mean oh right flatter Earth only GR that

5512.52 --> 5518.84
can hate that is IND yeah but I

5516.119 --> 5521.119
mean that's not really an issue

5518.84 --> 5523.88
Clary yes it is doesn't mean that

5521.119 --> 5527.36
everybody then per default does that

5523.88 --> 5528.92
though but there's a lot of like people

5527.36 --> 5530.5599999999995
come in like ah what is this kind of

5528.92 --> 5534.4
stupid flat earther right I mean that's

5530.56 --> 5536.2390000000005
been happening for a decade like that

5534.4 --> 5539.638999999999
was there from the start there's nothing

5536.239 --> 5542.48
really changed other than the world is a

5539.639 --> 5544.719
little bit more tense now and when

5542.48 --> 5547.0
things grow tense well then people tend

5544.719 --> 5552.04
to seek for something to lash out

5547.0 --> 5552.04
against more right that's logically

5553.56 --> 5560.0
happening okay you have an idea why it's

5556.04 --> 5560.0
happen Okay slowmo tell me

5570.639 --> 5573.639
please

5595.36 --> 5600.5199999999995
least I'm not a Christian it's very

5598.04 --> 5603.04
funny I had that did you know that I had

5600.52 --> 5605.679
that very convers like I didn't have to

5603.04 --> 5608.32
like bring it up like I talked with my

5605.679 --> 5611.0
social worker and he thought the same

5608.32 --> 5614.199
like he had the same

5611.0 --> 5617.52
view as I in that with Christianity like

5614.199 --> 5619.5599999999995
he's he recognized like yeah they all

5617.52 --> 5623.159000000001
get it

5619.56 --> 5626.4800000000005
wrong like they ignore Jesus they ignore

5623.159 --> 5628.719
the deeper implications there and only

5626.48 --> 5632.0
focus on everything

5628.719 --> 5633.679
else and thereby ignore the core message

5632.0 --> 5635.28
and that's like the entire point of the

5633.679 --> 5639.719
Bible is to

5635.28 --> 5642.119
encapsulate and cover up Christ's true

5639.719 --> 5644.96
power and

5642.119 --> 5648.239
wisdom to distract away from it and like

5644.96 --> 5651.28
he agreed to that it was like so

5648.239 --> 5653.839999999999
impressed like my social worker is a

5651.28 --> 5657.199
legend that

5653.84 --> 5659.400000000001
guy and he's had like he's has

5657.199 --> 5663.48
experience with all kinds of

5659.4 --> 5663.48
things like

5663.52 --> 5668.159000000001
yeah anyway I had that conversation with

5665.92 --> 5671.159
him and it was like really

5668.159 --> 5674.04
impressive so that that gave me some

5671.159 --> 5676.32
confidence too he also said like yeah

5674.04 --> 5678.239
you might keep feeling bad like this

5676.32 --> 5680.48
again like don't worry about it like we

5678.239 --> 5682.759999999999
can make a weekly appointment

5680.48 --> 5685.0
even like because you mostly just need

5682.76 --> 5687.0
to talk about it because every time you

5685.0 --> 5691.199
don't you bottle it up and then you

5687.0 --> 5694.84
really go nuts from it so he was so

5691.199 --> 5697.239
understanding it was great very

5694.84 --> 5700.96
relieving gave me like a bit more

5697.239 --> 5700.959999999999
courage to just deal with all

5709.199 --> 5713.799999999999
this maybe they don't like me doing

5715.04 --> 5718.04
speculation

5718.159 --> 5722.638999999999
maybe maybe they I don't know maybe they

5721.159 --> 5724.159
don't

5722.639 --> 5726.719
I

5724.159 --> 5728.719
mean I'm still going to do it though and

5726.719 --> 5730.96
I'm not going to make any like overt

5728.719 --> 5732.76
claims about it I'm not going to make

5730.96 --> 5736.639
like I'm not going to go into a debate

5732.76 --> 5739.56
and then like it's like this

5736.639 --> 5741.96
like because there's no point I'm just I

5739.56 --> 5743.4400000000005
I at best I'd just be saying like no I

5741.96 --> 5746.639
think it's like

5743.44 --> 5750.32
this I and I know how to be able to

5746.639 --> 5753.719
falsify that but I don't have the

5750.32 --> 5756.44
information I can't do it now it's like

5753.719 --> 5759.719
but I have an idea that could be tested

5756.44 --> 5762.599999999999
could be tested to be true or

5759.719 --> 5765.52
false and and that's what I do and they

5762.6 --> 5768.1990000000005
don't have to like it it's what I do

5765.52 --> 5770.719
they don't have to do it I do it and I

5768.199 --> 5772.96
will keep doing

5770.719 --> 5775.56
that and if that means they they won't

5772.96 --> 5778.36
have any association because of just

5775.56 --> 5780.639
that thing then fine don't have any

5778.36 --> 5784.799999999999
association you keep stuck into that

5780.639 --> 5787.119
absolute materialistic world view of

5784.8 --> 5790.119000000001
things

5787.119 --> 5790.119
and

5790.639 --> 5795.719
whatever yeah I mean science is not

5794.56 --> 5798.8
enough for

5795.719 --> 5801.56
me it's really useful it's really

5798.8 --> 5803.159000000001
helpful it's especially super helpful to

5801.56 --> 5805.96
understand how things have gone wrong

5803.159 --> 5807.799999999999
out there in the world yeah but that

5805.96 --> 5810.28
doesn't mean that I'll oh that means

5807.8 --> 5813.119000000001
that I'll just never do anything other

5810.28 --> 5814.44
than figure out what I'm absolutely

5813.119 --> 5817.88
certain

5814.44 --> 5821.159
about like yeah well that way there's

5817.88 --> 5824.76
tons of things that we won't never even

5821.159 --> 5827.32
be able to remotely touch yeah like the

5824.76 --> 5830.04
nature of the celestials you will just

5827.32 --> 5832.28
never be able to remotely touch it or be

5830.04 --> 5835.0
inclined to fall back into typical

5832.28 --> 5839.48
physicality assumption bias-based ideas

5835.0 --> 5844.719
about them that are obviously wrong

5839.48 --> 5847.759999999999
like so specifically to bypass that I

5844.719 --> 5850.32
will absolutely

5847.76 --> 5854.04
unrelentingly

5850.32 --> 5857.0
speculate I will I will keep doing that

5854.04 --> 5860.0
I will keep my Niche ideas which is what

5857.0 --> 5863.56
they are they're very Niche ideas that I

5860.0 --> 5866.84
think are incredibly valuable for the

5863.56 --> 5870.2390000000005
future because everybody is just holding

5866.84 --> 5871.719
on to this archaic interpretation [ __ ]

5870.239 --> 5874.839999999999
of everything

5871.719 --> 5879.08
I'm like throwing all of that crap away

5874.84 --> 5881.84
and I'm like let's start from [ __ ]

5879.08 --> 5884.5599999999995
scratch let's like completely throw out

5881.84 --> 5886.76
all these assumptions let's just start

5884.56 --> 5889.080000000001
from

5886.76 --> 5891.119000000001
scratch and that's what I have done and

5889.08 --> 5892.44
I'm proud of what I've done I'm proud of

5891.119 --> 5895.679
what I've

5892.44 --> 5899.5599999999995
achieved when it comes to

5895.679 --> 5901.76
ideas ways of looking at things

5899.56 --> 5905.1990000000005
reconsiderations about things that were

5901.76 --> 5910.76
taken for granted and I'm proud about it

5905.199 --> 5910.759999999999
and nobody can undo that and I will not

5915.21 --> 5918.319
[Music]

5927.56 --> 5931.76
stop yeah Rich well that's not

5929.8 --> 5933.679
surprising feeling at all because it

5931.76 --> 5935.719
does absolutely seem like that and I

5933.679 --> 5937.719
don't know how the hell they're supposed

5935.719 --> 5941.92
to be achieving

5937.719 --> 5945.2390000000005
that it's stupid like it's not working

5941.92 --> 5945.2390000000005
don't you see that it's not

5960.04 --> 5965.4
working esoteric aspect of reality

5963.04 --> 5968.08
leaving Flat Earth trolls

5965.4 --> 5970.119
behind well clear I'm always dealing

5968.08 --> 5973.4
with that but I

5970.119 --> 5976.0
mean there is still so much interesting

5973.4 --> 5979.48
detail to figure out about the

5976.0 --> 5982.84
realm I just find it fascinating like

5979.48 --> 5984.799999999999
what can I leave behind about

5982.84 --> 5987.8
it you

5984.8 --> 5989.08
know I mean I don't always have to bring

5987.8 --> 5993.96
up Flat

5989.08 --> 5996.84
Earth but in ways it's going to like

5993.96 --> 5999.32
find its way through like somebody's

5996.84 --> 6001.76
like this oh this and that oh something

5999.32 --> 6005.719
like Hollow Earth or whatever

6001.76 --> 6008.84
like and then I'll be like immediately

6005.719 --> 6012.8
like yeah here's some

6008.84 --> 6015.360000000001
model issues with that entire idea and

6012.8 --> 6018.04
it will be involving flatter so it's

6015.36 --> 6021.199
like I can't really ever completely get

6018.04 --> 6024.88
rid of it because it's integrated like

6021.199 --> 6027.879999999999
the Flat Earth itself is

6024.88 --> 6030.04
used and the psychology about how we

6027.88 --> 6033.52
work that's being used in the

6030.04 --> 6033.5199999999995
construction of the Mind

6034.56 --> 6042.76
Control right it's being

6038.44 --> 6042.759999999999
used so it will always come

6049.92 --> 6052.92
back

6083.8 --> 6088.92
hm okay clutch yeah I've heard that

6086.119 --> 6088.92
that's in there it's

6089.159 --> 6094.44
interesting Hollow Earth with like the

6091.32 --> 6094.44
Apes in there and all

6105.28 --> 6111.679
that

6107.239 --> 6114.48
what anyone try talking to them to find

6111.679 --> 6117.119
out their end goal who are you talking

6114.48 --> 6120.4
about gentle

6117.119 --> 6120.4
bear who

6121.98 --> 6125.12
[Music]

6125.639 --> 6128.88

[Music]

6155.15 --> 6158.839999999999
[Music]

6169.76 --> 6174.679
for

6171.92 --> 6178.119
why these trolls are pestering you well

6174.679 --> 6180.28
I've asked it and they never respond

6178.119 --> 6183.5599999999995
they just want to get to

6180.28 --> 6183.5599999999995
me that's

6183.639 --> 6189.04
it there's just this little flame and

6186.719 --> 6192.08
they're a moth to my flame and they just

6189.04 --> 6195.199
want to extinguish the flame at all

6192.08 --> 6197.5199999999995
cost that's it I mean I've experienced

6195.199 --> 6199.5599999999995
that even when I was a little kid that's

6197.52 --> 6201.52
always happened some people are just

6199.56 --> 6204.119000000001
Hell Bound to get me somehow they're

6201.52 --> 6207.0
just they just want to extinguish that

6204.119 --> 6207.0
flame that I

6208.44 --> 6211.99
have and that's what it is as far as I

6211.599 --> 6216.39

6229.04 --> 6236.12

6351.639 --> 6357.96
it's real right I'm not just seeing

6354.0 --> 6361.36
things like that they really it's really

6357.96 --> 6361.36
happening and

6364.32 --> 6372.0
like I I don't

6367.199 --> 6372.0
understand like what the [ __ ]

6379.4 --> 6385.759999999999
why and but by the way like because of

6383.599 --> 6389.0
that there have been people that have

6385.76 --> 6389.0
found my channel here

6393.88 --> 6398.36
though like some people are like what

6396.44 --> 6401.598999999999
the hell is this Arwin guy that

6398.36 --> 6401.598999999999
everybody's all whiny

6401.719 --> 6405.84
about and so they come and check it

6405.96 --> 6413.84
out this that is

6409.4 --> 6413.839999999999
happening it's just so

6424.239 --> 6428.199
strange a flat Earth meet up or

6426.599 --> 6430.719
conference in the Netherlands no not

6428.199 --> 6435.598999999999
that I know of

6430.719 --> 6435.599
no I I mean I was at a conference in

6439.32 --> 6443.679
2019

6441.48 --> 6447.32
I met like Adam Nathan Oakley and even

6443.679 --> 6450.52
Karen B there was pretty cool although I

6447.32 --> 6454.599
was like also like very high tense I was

6450.52 --> 6454.599
very nervous around that

6455.52 --> 6459.719
time it was very tense for me CU like it

6458.32 --> 6462.0
was the first time I was going to ever

6459.719 --> 6463.2390000000005
actually meet any of the flat earthers

6462.0 --> 6465.599
face to

6463.239 --> 6469.32
face yeah first

6465.599 --> 6472.32
time but yeah since then no

6469.32 --> 6472.32
nothing

6478.4 --> 6483.5199999999995
what show rest starts okay that sucks

6481.159 --> 6483.5199999999995
gentle

6499.239 --> 6502.239
bear

6529.199 --> 6532.199
for

6539.96 --> 6545.119
right but I mean it's weird though like

6542.4 --> 6547.598999999999
the trolls do come in waves so there's

6545.119 --> 6550.239
whole periods where there's like almost

6547.599 --> 6552.639
no troll comments and I have to say that

6550.239 --> 6555.879999999999
actually in the last three weeks the

6552.639 --> 6557.639
amount of troll comments that I get has

6555.88 --> 6561.599
really

6557.639 --> 6564.4800000000005
decreased it's decreased

6561.599 --> 6565.639
I tend to now get on average more

6564.48 --> 6568.5599999999995
positive

6565.639 --> 6570.1990000000005
comments including from you guys than

6568.56 --> 6571.04
that I get troll comments that I have to

6570.199 --> 6575.32
throw

6571.04 --> 6576.88
away so like and that's been changed for

6575.32 --> 6579.84
a

6576.88 --> 6582.36
while it's all so weird to me like I

6579.84 --> 6586.96
don't understand

6582.36 --> 6590.48
why maybe it's just me being on fed

6586.96 --> 6593.28
just like multiplied the agitation

6590.48 --> 6596.159
factor or

6593.28 --> 6597.719
something I felt sometimes like I when I

6596.159 --> 6601.799999999999
was there and when I speak up that

6597.719 --> 6605.0
people like really really can't send

6601.8 --> 6608.0
me like the Ballers or

6605.0 --> 6611.84
whatever and I even played with that you

6608.0 --> 6615.52
know like kind of being taunting and all

6611.84 --> 6619.04
that but I mean it's pretty damn surreal

6615.52 --> 6622.92
like the difference now it's completely

6619.04 --> 6622.92
different now it's very

6634.679 --> 6641.32
strange it's like it almost feels like

6638.36 --> 6643.839999999999
when I just left fed with the rage and

6641.32 --> 6646.5599999999995
everything I mean I couldn't go back

6643.84 --> 6649.679
like oh did you just go back so quicker

6646.56 --> 6652.2390000000005
and no it was the point is it was over

6649.679 --> 6652.2390000000005
like it was

6652.96 --> 6659.2390000000005
broken right and there needed to be

6656.4 --> 6661.04
conditions they were never going to give

6659.239 --> 6664.32
me those condition

6661.04 --> 6667.48
ever because they decided that it's just

6664.32 --> 6667.48
my problem my

6667.599 --> 6672.52
fault it is that's what they decided

6670.52 --> 6675.52
that's what they think about it

6672.52 --> 6675.52
still

6675.639 --> 6681.079
and but when I left it's just like it's

6678.639 --> 6683.52
like I I changed the entire scene or

6681.079 --> 6687.04
something everything changed all of a

6683.52 --> 6689.1990000000005
sudden like really big like the way

6687.04 --> 6691.239
people even behave it's like it changed

6689.199 --> 6693.5199999999995
the entire field in which everybody

6691.239 --> 6696.199
operates or something I don't know what

6693.52 --> 6699.320000000001
the hell that was but there was some big

6696.199 --> 6704.239
shift happening that I could feel at the

6699.32 --> 6704.239
time and like I changed after

6704.88 --> 6711.96
that did you notice that slowmo Moy guys

6725.92 --> 6729.679
like do I have that much

6729.92 --> 6734.0
power that just by walking away like

6732.92 --> 6737.159
everything

6734.0 --> 6739.239
changes like I never thought I I knew I

6737.159 --> 6741.159
was like holding it over the heads I

6739.239 --> 6742.799999999999
remember in my rage like oh let's just

6741.159 --> 6745.598999999999
see how you're going to do without Arwin

6742.8 --> 6748.320000000001
then yeah if I'm causing you

6745.599 --> 6752.0
money that that was kind of the re the

6748.32 --> 6755.5199999999995
premise but apparently it's like I

6752.0 --> 6758.36
overstepped that premise way

6755.52 --> 6761.400000000001
much way more than I ever thought that

6758.36 --> 6763.719
it would and like changed everything

6761.4 --> 6765.879999999999
somehow it's what it kind of feels like

6763.719 --> 6769.32
now

6765.88 --> 6772.84
and it's just I never thought it it

6769.32 --> 6772.84
would even make that much

6774.4 --> 6781.0
impact and maybe I am just like way

6778.199 --> 6783.678999999999
stronger and more influential than I

6781.0 --> 6786.28
even feel that I

6783.679 --> 6789.1990000000005
am which is really

6786.28 --> 6791.88
bizarre not scary like I'll deal with it

6789.199 --> 6795.839999999999
but it's like it's just odd

6791.88 --> 6798.56
because I don't really feel all that

6795.84 --> 6800.96
impressive and the way that I act I

6798.56 --> 6803.96
guess I

6800.96 --> 6806.159
maybe emphasizing it specifically be

6803.96 --> 6807.8
because I feel like my expression is

6806.159 --> 6810.0
like too weak and all that I think that

6807.8 --> 6815.2390000000005
I don't make enough impression I feel

6810.0 --> 6819.0
like a very timid but I guess I'm not

6815.239 --> 6820.36
I'm not timid I'm actually sort of

6819.0 --> 6823.239
visually

6820.36 --> 6826.88
impressive and then the trolls are

6823.239 --> 6830.5199999999995
go but I guess that I

6826.88 --> 6834.92
am and then doing things makes much more

6830.52 --> 6837.040000000001
impact than I myself even notice like

6834.92 --> 6839.4
I've trouble

6837.04 --> 6841.639
realizing it's like I'm a big giant

6839.4 --> 6843.598999999999
living among dwarfs and I don't realize

6841.639 --> 6845.639
it's like yeah but I feel smaller than

6843.599 --> 6848.599
you guys yeah but you're like three

6845.639 --> 6853.0
times as big yeah but I feel

6848.599 --> 6853.0
smaller it's that kind of weird

6856.28 --> 6861.88
thing and just like the entire weird

6859.079 --> 6864.759999999999
paranoia situation also revealed that

6861.88 --> 6868.119
that I had like in the last week being

6864.76 --> 6870.96
scared I was just continually oh my God

6868.119 --> 6874.639
they're going to get me I'm so scared

6870.96 --> 6877.36
I'm so vulnerable when it seems that

6874.639 --> 6880.32
actually like when I go around it's

6877.36 --> 6882.48
quite the other way around it seems that

6880.32 --> 6885.96
especially when I'm in a certain mood I

6882.48 --> 6888.678999999999
can be like completely oblivious to

6885.96 --> 6890.2390000000005
myself come across very

6888.679 --> 6895.8
intimidating

6890.239 --> 6899.959999999999
which is like what what do you mean I am

6895.8 --> 6902.88
what I don't feel that I just feel like

6899.96 --> 6906.28
Broody or something I don't feel great

6902.88 --> 6908.159000000001
but I'm like that scary to

6906.28 --> 6911.159
people

6908.159 --> 6911.159
oh

6918.599 --> 6922.28
weird

6920.239 --> 6926.5599999999995
the panel wide range of person is what

6922.28 --> 6926.5599999999995
made it great yes I agree slow moon

6930.639 --> 6934.96
buggy but I mean in that sense they'll

6933.0 --> 6938.119
always have Neil

6934.96 --> 6938.119
so you

6940.8 --> 6946.320000000001
know then you're just going to have to

6943.079 --> 6949.4
find your own little way through

6946.32 --> 6951.719
now cuz I ain't going to do it I don't

6949.4 --> 6954.598999999999
even even feel like I don't have the

6951.719 --> 6957.159
energy to do that even if I did go

6954.599 --> 6959.28
back just like that enormous show it's

6957.159 --> 6961.4
like yeah I can say like a couple of

6959.28 --> 6966.599
things but I

6961.4 --> 6966.598999999999
mean that's not how I

6974.8 --> 6982.04
operate yeah tell me about it Gavin

6978.04 --> 6984.44
V so yeah I mean good luck you keep

6982.04 --> 6984.44
doing

7000.679 --> 7007.0
that Flat Earth debating is

7003.52 --> 7009.040000000001
toxic yeah well that's why I don't

7007.0 --> 7011.599
really bicker with Ballers that much

7009.04 --> 7014.199
anymore now do I clear

7011.599 --> 7017.719
it because of that because I do feel

7014.199 --> 7020.44
it's toxic like the amusement value for

7017.719 --> 7023.84
me has kind of run

7020.44 --> 7026.32
out like at this point it's just

7023.84 --> 7030.0
bickering with mentally ill people and

7026.32 --> 7033.759999999999
I'm like so tired of

7030.0 --> 7036.04
it like I'm done I don't want to bicker

7033.76 --> 7038.4400000000005
anymore these people believe in this

7036.04 --> 7040.159
[ __ ] and they can die with that [ __ ] for

7038.44 --> 7042.48
all I care

7040.159 --> 7044.04
just go in your rocket and splatter

7042.48 --> 7046.879999999999
against the firmament thinking that

7044.04 --> 7049.44
you're moving to a better place or what

7046.88 --> 7051.88
I don't give a [ __ ] anymore man you want

7049.44 --> 7055.079
to believe that hor [ __ ] no matter how

7051.88 --> 7058.32
[ __ ] it is being presented to you

7055.079 --> 7062.28
how embarrassing it is then you believe

7058.32 --> 7064.639
that it's not my problem anymore man

7062.28 --> 7066.36
that's how I feel about

7064.639 --> 7069.4800000000005
it

7066.36 --> 7072.92
right I will not be obstructed with

7069.48 --> 7076.04
putting down how I see things though and

7072.92 --> 7078.159
so there's nothing stopping me

7076.04 --> 7081.719
now I can

7078.159 --> 7086.598999999999
just share my visualizations my my

7081.719 --> 7089.56
dreams my Visions my ideas my

7086.599 --> 7092.28
realization I can just all do that

7089.56 --> 7094.88
stuff without being surrounded by

7092.28 --> 7097.32
bickering by people that are belligerent

7094.88 --> 7101.32
and just like just want me to shut up

7097.32 --> 7101.32
because they're scared

7102.199 --> 7104.879999999999
I'm done with

7128.32 --> 7133.28
that

7130.88 --> 7136.2390000000005
singled me out for everything can you be

7133.28 --> 7139.88
more specific Richard G what do you mean

7136.239 --> 7142.598999999999
singled me out for everything with

7139.88 --> 7146.4400000000005
what I mean they did put me like on like

7142.599 --> 7147.88
a shame Spotlight at times and it was

7146.44 --> 7150.759999999999
very [ __ ]

7147.88 --> 7152.52
annoying and I don't really I felt like

7150.76 --> 7155.320000000001
I was

7152.52 --> 7158.2390000000005
being what do you call that

7155.32 --> 7161.719
the a Sur

7158.239 --> 7164.119
get that it wasn't even really about me

7161.719 --> 7165.4800000000005
when that when they were doing that most

7164.119 --> 7168.639
of the

7165.48 --> 7173.159
time but I mean like looking

7168.639 --> 7177.1990000000005
back like it seems more like no no they

7173.159 --> 7179.079
really see me as like the little [ __ ]

7177.199 --> 7182.04
that happens to have smart remarks here

7179.079 --> 7184.239
and there that's just enough for

7182.04 --> 7186.159
everybody to think like oh well you can

7184.239 --> 7188.799999999999
be one of us now but we're definitely

7186.159 --> 7193.839999999999
going to smack you around all the time

7188.8 --> 7197.88
and I'm like like no how about you

7193.84 --> 7200.96
don't how about you go smack each others

7197.88 --> 7202.32
around yeah go smack each other around

7200.96 --> 7205.8
I'm not going to be smacked around

7202.32 --> 7208.159
anymore like that like I don't care how

7205.8 --> 7211.0
you feel about

7208.159 --> 7212.96
me or what I do I'm not going to be

7211.0 --> 7216.239
smacked around like that there is no

7212.96 --> 7217.84
justification for you to do that I'm

7216.239 --> 7221.598999999999
literally being

7217.84 --> 7224.04
trolled by people that tell me this is

7221.599 --> 7225.28
embarrassing that you let him talk to

7224.04 --> 7231.079
you like

7225.28 --> 7231.079
that and that's like not really even

7231.159 --> 7236.679
trolls that's just regular followers

7233.96 --> 7240.679
that just tell me like I don't

7236.679 --> 7240.679
understand why you put up with

7243.76 --> 7247.76
that and I would always say like yeah

7246.32 --> 7249.4
well because it's worth it it's like

7247.76 --> 7252.400000000001
worth sitting through the ride I'm

7249.4 --> 7254.879999999999
learning so much and yeah I don't like

7252.4 --> 7257.44
everything about it but I can't get my

7254.88 --> 7259.52
moments out and that's what what matters

7257.44 --> 7261.28
like I that's What mattered to me and

7259.52 --> 7264.320000000001
the rest was like uh yeah it's not

7261.28 --> 7266.759999999999
perfect but I mean I've never had any

7264.32 --> 7269.679
experience with any school where

7266.76 --> 7272.280000000001
anything went perfect at all so it's

7269.679 --> 7276.96
just like yeah just the

7272.28 --> 7276.96
usual but now like

7277.159 --> 7283.839999999999
no no it's changed now it's changed

7281.719 --> 7288.599
there's no

7283.84 --> 7290.96
more win situation for me to get out of

7288.599 --> 7293.4800000000005
accepting that kind of behavior towards

7290.96 --> 7296.2390000000005
me there's nothing I can get out of it

7293.48 --> 7301.239
anymore it's not worth it

7296.239 --> 7301.239
anymore and so I'm not accepting that

7308.04 --> 7311.04
anymore

7314.599 --> 7318.84
okay borders boy you

7325.639 --> 7332.599
did shame Spotlight is fully on Neil

7329.199 --> 7336.598999999999
really wow well good luck with that

7332.599 --> 7336.599
Neil I think he wants it

7337.199 --> 7343.199
too NE was just weird man like every

7340.52 --> 7346.1990000000005
time I show up anywhere he's always like

7343.199 --> 7349.0
oh I can't be together with Arwin

7346.199 --> 7350.598999999999
here and he even says like yeah because

7349.0 --> 7352.679
he told me like yeah you're a little

7350.599 --> 7357.079
much

7352.679 --> 7359.76
sometimes like oh my God how dare you

7357.079 --> 7363.0
well any apologies your made are

7359.76 --> 7365.599
definitely negated if you tell me hey I

7363.0 --> 7369.56
sorry I sometimes just you're a little

7365.599 --> 7371.52
much well forgiveness retracted

7369.56 --> 7374.639
mean that makes sense that's like a

7371.52 --> 7376.8
stable person saying that right that's

7374.639 --> 7380.0
definitely a friendship you really want

7376.8 --> 7383.56
to repair somehow like that's possible

7380.0 --> 7386.56
with a person that acts like that

7383.56 --> 7386.56
ever

7397.88 --> 7400.88
G

7401.88 --> 7406.0

7427.88 --> 7430.88

7469.239 --> 7476.558999999999
but you are all now showing me that no

7474.04 --> 7478.559
what I felt was there and it just

7476.559 --> 7482.360000000001
doesn't make any

7478.559 --> 7484.8
sense and it's not me it just didn't

7482.36 --> 7484.799999999999
make any

7487.76 --> 7490.76
