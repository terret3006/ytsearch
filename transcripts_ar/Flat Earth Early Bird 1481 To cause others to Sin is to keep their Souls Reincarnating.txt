108.72 --> 114.74
total [ __ ]

111.479 --> 114.74
like two days ago

114.96 --> 121.979
is

116.88 --> 124.939
windy and rainy and gray and ugh I'm not

121.979 --> 124.939
going outside today

127.68 --> 132.0
right

129.899 --> 133.8
but well not while it's like this and

132.0 --> 135.78
when it's like this usually it's like

133.8 --> 138.239
this for a long time

135.78 --> 140.459
just like two days ago it was the whole

138.239 --> 143.84
day so

140.459 --> 143.84
indoor day over here

154.26 --> 158.94
all right

155.959 --> 160.86
nobody here just yet

158.94 --> 168.18
I don't know

160.86 --> 169.44000000000003
it is Saturday the 14th of January 2023

168.18 --> 171.9
ah

169.44 --> 174.5
so almost halfway the month that's

171.9 --> 174.5
that's something

177.66 --> 181.76
it's been a tough first half of the

179.64 --> 181.76
month

184.94 --> 190.739
all right

187.459 --> 192.54
what I'm still going thanks to the

190.739 --> 195.62
support of

192.54 --> 195.62
my followers

197.4 --> 199.94
right

200.459 --> 204.84
anyway so yeah yesterday was a very

202.86 --> 208.08
interesting day

204.84 --> 210.3
I think now although nah

208.08 --> 213.06
it was okay

210.3 --> 216.54000000000002
I did yeah well

213.06 --> 217.98
I did go and get beers again but yeah

216.54 --> 220.26
man I am

217.98 --> 221.879
very much feeling the difference not

220.26 --> 225.06
that I'm having a hangover or anything

221.879 --> 227.879
but I'm just

225.06 --> 230.459
this is a real different experience and

227.879 --> 232.85999999999999
I am well not going to be drinking today

230.459 --> 235.28
I'm sure and we'll see what happens

232.86 --> 235.28
tomorrow

236.459 --> 241.2
this is like maybe it's like because of

239.34 --> 245.34
the time of the year

241.2 --> 247.85999999999999
or maybe I'm just

245.34 --> 252.20000000000002
like I've been doing it too much and

247.86 --> 252.20000000000002
it's like wearing out on me

252.36 --> 257.04
so I think I'm gonna really attempt to

254.7 --> 259.919
like stop drinking

257.04 --> 264.44
boost for a period you know maybe a year

259.919 --> 264.44
maybe forever depending on

264.54 --> 270.78000000000003
well if it's even going to be worth at

267.0 --> 274.38
any point to return to it

270.78 --> 277.67999999999995
because yeah two days ago I had like I

274.38 --> 281.18
was in a really good form

277.68 --> 281.18
because I didn't drink the day before

285.6 --> 291.41900000000004
right and even if yeah yesterday's show

289.259 --> 295.32
but uh

291.419 --> 297.419
yeah I'm still okay just

295.32 --> 299.4
now the weather's getting to me a little

297.419 --> 302.21999999999997
bit more

299.4 --> 305.4
and yeah I had some weird little

302.22 --> 308.88000000000005
accident earlier very annoying I

305.4 --> 310.79999999999995
basically ripped my freaking curtain

308.88 --> 313.1
that was like

310.8 --> 315.84000000000003
ah

313.1 --> 318.68
but I patched it up

315.84 --> 322.5
it's like the first thing that I did

318.68 --> 326.699
and yeah it's holding but this like that

322.5 --> 329.639
was that sucked right pretty big rim

326.699 --> 331.139
but I fixed it pretty decently if I say

329.639 --> 334.639
so myself

331.139 --> 334.639
I can barely even see it

334.74 --> 338.16
and there's just this wrinkle here

336.539 --> 340.82
that's it

338.16 --> 340.82000000000005
so

342.74 --> 347.06
a bit of an annoying morning

348.419 --> 351.74
but things are all right

353.94 --> 357.919
if somebody's gonna show up that is

365.34 --> 368.0
all right

370.259 --> 374.94
yesterday I was just looking at the

372.6 --> 376.5
comments from my show yesterday it was

374.94 --> 378.6
really weird

376.5 --> 381.259
it says like

378.6 --> 381.259
what is it

383.9 --> 389.63899999999995
seven comments

386.46 --> 391.25899999999996
there were two comments which were like

389.639 --> 393.78000000000003
very gross

391.259 --> 395.699
so I deleted them but like where's the

393.78 --> 397.79999999999995
other five comments

395.699 --> 401.639
I don't get it and I went into YouTube

397.8 --> 404.94
Studio into like the comments

401.639 --> 407.40000000000003
and there weren't any so I was like what

404.94 --> 409.259
what's going on here

407.4 --> 412.79999999999995
why does YouTube still say their

409.259 --> 415.319
comments there it's really weird

412.8 --> 417.90000000000003
uh

415.319 --> 420.36
hey that flat fellow first in chat good

417.9 --> 423.08
see you man it's been a while

420.36 --> 423.08000000000004
how are you doing

426.419 --> 429.139
ah

429.419 --> 432.38
hey Cleary

434.34 --> 438.419
right so I'm sticking to the minty

436.38 --> 442.039
because that cert like

438.419 --> 442.039
didn't get any tea yesterday

442.199 --> 446.819
and

444.3 --> 450.18
even though I miss it a bit

446.819 --> 452.28000000000003
it does make a big difference

450.18 --> 456.36
so it's it's kind of funny like

452.28 --> 458.63899999999995
yesterday was an experience of combining

456.36 --> 462.66
certainly not drinking and not drinking

458.639 --> 465.72
green tea for most of the day before

462.66 --> 468.06
and both made a big impact today well

465.72 --> 469.62
I'm still not drinking green tea all

468.06 --> 472.38
right I said I would experiment with

469.62 --> 476.539
this but I did get beers they did feel

472.38 --> 480.65999999999997
the difference although yeah I mean

476.539 --> 482.58
less though but still enough to make me

480.66 --> 485.12
consider like yeah maybe it's not really

482.58 --> 485.12
worth it

486.78 --> 491.63899999999995
cost extra it kind of forces me to go

489.539 --> 494.81899999999996
out a lot

491.639 --> 497.34000000000003
because you can't just like get theirs

494.819 --> 501.06
for a week like that doesn't fit in my

497.34 --> 503.15999999999997
bag is huge very heavy so

501.06 --> 505.259
I have to yeah if I even want to drink

503.16 --> 506.639
beer I have to like go out at least

505.259 --> 509.819
every two days

506.639 --> 511.02
it's a lot because of that

509.819 --> 512.659
right

511.02 --> 515.459
so I'm gonna

512.659 --> 517.62
see if I can cut that down

515.459 --> 519.8389999999999
maybe it's gonna be like one day

517.62 --> 522.3
drinking the other day not

519.839 --> 525.0200000000001
or maybe I'm just gonna completely stop

522.3 --> 525.02
we'll see

525.74 --> 530.409
[Music]

535.38 --> 540.36
wow

537.72 --> 543.72
winter birds

540.36 --> 545.64
okay that fellow good to hear you're

543.72 --> 549.32
still keeping busy

545.64 --> 549.3199999999999
have I been yeah

549.959 --> 552.779
I've been kind of Grouchy in the last

551.88 --> 556.26
month

552.779 --> 558.38
especially like around Christmas time I

556.26 --> 560.64
had a week that was like it was so bad

558.38 --> 563.459
such a bad mood

560.64 --> 565.76
but yeah that's definitely recovering

563.459 --> 565.76
and

565.92 --> 570.5999999999999
having like a little internal early

568.5 --> 573.5
spring that's really kind of what it

570.6 --> 577.1
feels like it's like uh more light and

573.5 --> 577.1
faculties returning

578.399 --> 585.42
parts of the agitation that comes with

582.6 --> 588.0600000000001
the winter dropping not all of it all at

585.42 --> 590.5799999999999
once but like I can feel that sort of

588.06 --> 592.38
thing I I really am sensitive to like

590.58 --> 594.4200000000001
what's going on

592.38 --> 597.3
inside

594.42 --> 601.279
and size it up so yeah I am doing better

597.3 --> 601.279
I'm looking forward to the actual spring

605.94 --> 610.6800000000001
and yeah

607.92 --> 614.279
but yeah until then

610.68 --> 617.0999999999999
it's about getting through this winter

614.279 --> 618.899
especially financially because this

617.1 --> 620.58
winter is a lot tougher than any winter

618.899 --> 623.54
that I've had before because of the

620.58 --> 623.5400000000001
financial situation

624.72 --> 627.2
right

629.04 --> 635.959
so I did also

631.62 --> 635.9590000000001
finish the taboo series

638.339 --> 642.1800000000001
on Netflix

640.44 --> 646.1
the other part

642.18 --> 646.0999999999999
it's very very intense

646.2 --> 650.1
like

647.579 --> 653.88
it's weird in a way the series gets so

650.1 --> 656.1
intense that it's almost uncomfortable

653.88 --> 657.8389999999999
well almost it is there are things about

656.1 --> 660.36
it that are like on purpose

657.839 --> 663.8000000000001
uncomfortable that is part of like I

660.36 --> 663.8000000000001
guess the taboo theme

665.339 --> 671.519
but it's like it's so tense everything

667.68 --> 671.519
is so like

671.72 --> 676.44
retaining the tension and not like jump

674.64 --> 679.04
scaring or

676.44 --> 679.0400000000001
just

681.36 --> 687.72
no expressions of Extreme Rage without

684.3 --> 690.3599999999999
like severe like dire consequences

687.72 --> 694.2
usually

690.36 --> 696.62
and it is just a very tense

694.2 --> 696.62
series

697.5 --> 704.04
so if you are yourself like kind of

700.26 --> 706.74
tense then can be quite risky

704.04 --> 710.18
so yeah it's one of the series you have

706.74 --> 710.1800000000001
to be in a special mood for that

710.22 --> 714.5400000000001
anyway

711.959 --> 716.8199999999999
what I I did definitely appreciate the

714.54 --> 718.019
craft of it

716.82 --> 720.44
and

718.019 --> 723.9590000000001
like basically the main character's

720.44 --> 726.3000000000001
Blends are very fascinating

723.959 --> 728.5189999999999
because he all keeps it to himself you

726.3 --> 732.0
basically just get to see as he unfolds

728.519 --> 734.399
it that it's like the mystery of his

732.0 --> 738.38
plan that is like the mystery of the

734.399 --> 738.38
series like what the hell is his plan

740.82 --> 747.839
and he's really smart about it really

743.82 --> 748.9200000000001
stoic and really psychopathic in the

747.839 --> 752.22
sense that

748.92 --> 754.62
like he just completely

752.22 --> 757.5600000000001
does not allow his feelings to like

754.62 --> 760.38
intervene with his plans at all no

757.56 --> 762.8389999999999
matter like how extreme the suffering

760.38 --> 765.899
becomes literally

762.839 --> 767.2790000000001
just like whoa dude

765.899 --> 770.16
but yeah

767.279 --> 772.4399999999999
it was very interesting it also shows

770.16 --> 774.54
that yeah it's not like everybody dies

772.44 --> 777.5
in the end so there should be another

774.54 --> 777.5
follow-up

777.959 --> 782.89
dude

779.77 --> 782.89
[Applause]

790.63 --> 793.75
[Applause]

795.86 --> 798.92
all right

800.1 --> 803.1
foreign

804.26 --> 807.66
also yeah I've been planning videos

806.399 --> 811.139
yesterday

807.66 --> 814.4399999999999
howdy machowski had an interesting video

811.139 --> 816.3
like hyper esoteric about his well

814.44 --> 820.639
trained thinking and the title for

816.3 --> 820.639
today's show is based on well

822.12 --> 827.0600000000001
I'm part of that

823.74 --> 827.0600000000001
on part of that

828.3 --> 834.3599999999999
reasoning

830.279 --> 837.56
that he is like researching which I do

834.36 --> 837.5600000000001
think there is something to it

839.339 --> 844.5600000000001
right so the this formula came out of

842.519 --> 846.9590000000001
that and I thought it was like worthy

844.56 --> 850.26
enough to share and not necessarily

846.959 --> 853.1389999999999
gonna talk about that

850.26 --> 855.56
unless people want me to

853.139 --> 859.139
right

855.56 --> 861.56
I'm not just gonna talk to a screen

859.139 --> 861.5600000000001
though

862.5 --> 866.279
because I'm not completely full of that

865.139 --> 870.019
subject

866.279 --> 870.019
it's just a point of Interest

877.74 --> 882.3
right so is anybody still there I mean

880.74 --> 884.639
it's been

882.3 --> 888.079
almost 10 minutes

884.639 --> 888.0790000000001
since the last comment

888.18 --> 891.62
come on guys

892.92 --> 895.88
and girls

905.959 --> 911.3599999999999
yeah flat side perspective had a stream

908.699 --> 911.3599999999999
that was fun

912.779 --> 918.509
Jim Bob play two

914.33 --> 918.509
[Applause]

921.24 --> 926.04
although they overlapped each other

924.42 --> 928.68
and then

926.04 --> 930.779
yeah after that I basically started

928.68 --> 934.88
watching

930.779 --> 934.88
like taboo series and all that

935.82 --> 941.94
uh yeah no flat Earth debates but

939.54 --> 945.0
he did Premiere the Earth Chronicles

941.94 --> 948.1800000000001
versus fed where he on camera

945.0 --> 950.339
performed against these guys

948.18 --> 951.3
these Ballers together with another flat

950.339 --> 955.32
earther

951.3 --> 958.3199999999999
I mean that was a really good show I

955.32 --> 959.639
mean that was probably Nathan's best

958.32 --> 961.44
performance

959.639 --> 963.6
that I've ever seen

961.44 --> 965.7600000000001
on camera

963.6 --> 968.6990000000001
and that's like he is he was always

965.76 --> 970.56
pretty good like pretty early on with

he's got actor training and it really

972.36 --> 976.8000000000001
shows

973.38 --> 979.199

976.8 --> 982.26
say a few years ago

979.199 --> 986.5999999999999
this is like palpably better

like he's gone he's come very far

986.88 --> 992.59

989.339 --> 996.08

992.59 --> 996.08
[Applause]

996.899 --> 1002.24

999.66 --> 1004.8389999999999

1101.299 --> 1109.24
there's no spaces and dots in there

1115.62 --> 1118.6999999999998
[Music]

1121.64 --> 1124.24
what

1125.96 --> 1131.02
okay there's no live shows he's a video

1128.299 --> 1131.02
uploader

1142.46 --> 1146.9
oh great

1144.559 --> 1149.1789999999999
why the F dude why do you think I would

1146.9 --> 1151.3600000000001
be interesting in this like this is the

1149.179 --> 1153.26
social justice Warrior

1151.36 --> 1155.4799999999998
obsessed person

1153.26 --> 1160.4
he's like

1155.48 --> 1164.179
just a lot of videos about freaky gross

1160.4 --> 1167.919
people from what I can see sorry but why

1164.179 --> 1167.919
do you think I'd be interested in that

1169.52 --> 1173.08
nothing to watch

1173.84 --> 1181.24
uh yeah

1176.539 --> 1181.24
no I'm not that bored thanks

1181.52 --> 1187.7
he's not upset oh he's not obsessed

1183.98 --> 1190.1
except every video he's he's has is

1187.7 --> 1192.7
about that and he's not obsessed you say

1190.1 --> 1192.6999999999998
okay okay

1197.36 --> 1199.9599999999998
foreign

1203.0 --> 1208.0
it's just what the entire channel is

1205.16 --> 1208.0
about that's all

1209.6 --> 1214.9399999999998
you have not watched it yet yeah but I

1212.9 --> 1218.26
can definitely conclude that

1214.94 --> 1222.1000000000001
all the videos are about that

1218.26 --> 1222.1
but I'll take a peek

1229.34 --> 1234.32
I mean maybe

1230.96 --> 1236.32
very entertaining or very interesting in

1234.32 --> 1240.34
his

1236.32 --> 1240.34
oratory approach we'll see

1241.52 --> 1245.2
hello Crockett good to see you

1264.14 --> 1266.6200000000001
foreign

1280.48 --> 1286.179
but you judge straight away yeah I do

1282.919 --> 1286.179
that of course

1291.08 --> 1295.12
it's it's called pre-analysis

1295.22 --> 1300.679
right you gotta flick through something

1298.22 --> 1302.24
before you get a feel of what it is

1300.679 --> 1303.919
you're going to be subjecting yourself

1302.24 --> 1306.679
to if you're going to check it out more

1303.919 --> 1309.22
meticulously

1306.679 --> 1312.2
yeah

1309.22 --> 1314.8600000000001
and you can definitely judge a book by

1312.2 --> 1314.8600000000001
its covers

1321.14 --> 1326.7800000000002
I mean like from that Glimpse I don't

1324.14 --> 1330.38
have enough information to make a full

1326.78 --> 1334.3999999999999
review about the channel right

1330.38 --> 1338.74
but I definitely have enough data there

1334.4 --> 1338.74
to make a free analysis

1338.99 --> 1344.78
[Music]

1340.82 --> 1346.8799999999999
a preliminary so

1344.78 --> 1349.7
did you know the call is recorded then

1346.88 --> 1352.3600000000001
what no

1349.7 --> 1352.3600000000001
what

1356.539 --> 1361.0
okay Cleary I had no idea

1369.26 --> 1374.089
foreign

1370.98 --> 1374.089
[Music]

1402.799 --> 1405.799
foreign

1412.059 --> 1415.539
oh there you go

1416.2 --> 1421.659
[Music]

1417.4 --> 1421.659
what the hell is that

1422.84 --> 1427.059

1431.51 --> 1436.799
[Music]

1438.02 --> 1441.559
oh Russia

1440.419 --> 1444.2800000000002
okay

1441.559 --> 1444.28
huh

1450.2 --> 1457.1000000000001
yeah Alexander sweet is yeah yeah well I

1454.76 --> 1458.299
thought like maybe like native Canadian

1457.1 --> 1461.559
or something

1458.299 --> 1461.559
but yeah Russian

1465.02 --> 1470.96
I mean if if it would have had Russian

1467.48 --> 1474.88
letters I'd immediately recognize it for

1470.96 --> 1474.88
what it is but yeah so

1474.98 --> 1480.44
phonetically it could have been like

1477.74 --> 1482.78
native Canadian or something I don't

1480.44 --> 1484.8200000000002
know because hey that's pretty cold

1482.78 --> 1488.9189999999999
region too I mean

1484.82 --> 1488.9189999999999
yeah but apparently in Russia okay

1494.24 --> 1497.98
oh okay what

1503.96 --> 1509.98
okay well George Sanford seems to

1506.659 --> 1509.98
disagree with you Cleary

1510.62 --> 1516.34
but I'll leave it to you guys because

1513.08 --> 1516.34
I'm not Googling that

1524.69 --> 1530.579
[Music]

because I had the ingredients but I

1601.64 --> 1609.22

1604.58 --> 1609.22
the actual spaghetti or tortellinis

1609.44 --> 1614.72
the too early past the things

1612.26 --> 1618.799

1679.88 --> 1686.6000000000001
butter what the I use olive oil

1684.32 --> 1688.58
who the hell uses butter in spaghetti

1686.6 --> 1692.3799999999999
sauce I mean

1688.58 --> 1692.3799999999999
except for a really weird

1692.419 --> 1698.0200000000002
like trailer people or something this is

1695.12 --> 1698.02
what

1702.039 --> 1707.9
Frenchies oh yeah sure

1705.2 --> 1711.039

about being alive

1722.6 --> 1730.34
low oh smiling about okay yeah sure

1727.52 --> 1732.74
sure but hey everything has his time you

1730.34 --> 1735.02
don't always have to be happy about oh

1732.74 --> 1737.299
I'm so lucky sometimes she just kind of

1735.02 --> 1739.46
feels shitty or the weather's shitty or

1737.299 --> 1741.44
it's restless and then yeah I know in

1739.46 --> 1743.48
the back of my mind that I definitely

1741.44 --> 1746.0
have reasons to be happy it's just not

1743.48 --> 1748.34
the moment for it

1746.0 --> 1751.059
because annoying things happen today and

1748.34 --> 1751.059
the weather sucks

1751.58 --> 1756.58
but yeah it'll be fine you just gotta

1754.1 --> 1756.58
work through it

1756.62 --> 1761.779
anyway yeah but flatten the curve I

1759.08 --> 1764.0
definitely did use fresh tomatoes

1761.779 --> 1766.58
there were like uh

1764.0 --> 1767.779
flesh Tomatoes like those really plump

1766.58 --> 1771.02
ones

1767.779 --> 1772.279
and they were perfect I yeah because I

1771.02 --> 1776.0
had

1772.279 --> 1778.94
I basically gravel crush the tomatoes

1776.0 --> 1783.1
with my hands I crushed them with my

1778.94 --> 1783.1000000000001
bare hands it works the best

1783.26 --> 1789.98
and yeah it's delicious

1786.62 --> 1793.52
like lots of garlic

1789.98 --> 1796.34
onions like the the purple one so it's a

1793.52 --> 1797.6589999999999
very colory pasta

1796.34 --> 1800.6589999999999
uh

1797.659 --> 1802.88
squeeze Tomatoes carrot carrot base

1800.659 --> 1805.279
right carrots are basically the

1802.88 --> 1807.3200000000002
replacement of

1805.279 --> 1809.539
or egg carrots and eggplant are the

1807.32 --> 1812.299
replacement of the

1809.539 --> 1815.0
like the meatloaf

1812.299 --> 1817.039
the the beef

1815.0 --> 1819.919
that I used to originally make it with

1817.039 --> 1823.039
I'd make it vegan now or while vegan I

1819.919 --> 1824.659
do add like cheese afterward cheese

1823.039 --> 1827.679
powder

1824.659 --> 1831.919
but uh yeah

1827.679 --> 1834.64
with zucchini and

1831.919 --> 1834.64
the other one

1839.6 --> 1843.9189999999999
yeah

1841.76 --> 1847.899
zucchini

1843.919 --> 1847.8990000000001
zucchini and eggplant

1848.6 --> 1855.5
I think I got it yeah and it's like it

1852.559 --> 1858.1399999999999
was so much it literally didn't fit in

1855.5 --> 1860.84
my biggest pen so I took a smaller pen

1858.14 --> 1862.8990000000001
and then just like split it into pants

1860.84 --> 1866.1789999999999
and then it fit

1862.899 --> 1868.899
because it was too much which is a great

1866.179 --> 1868.8990000000001
thing by the way

1870.2 --> 1873.74
but in the past I would always be like

1872.12 --> 1875.5
ah

1873.74 --> 1878.179
it oh fits uh

1875.5 --> 1880.159
and then like it could get a mess if I

1878.179 --> 1882.98
just walk away but then I thought today

1880.159 --> 1885.919
like hmm what if I just take the smaller

1882.98 --> 1887.0
pan Which is almost identical except for

1885.919 --> 1889.5200000000002
the size

1887.0 --> 1892.46
and just add yeah just

1889.52 --> 1895.6589999999999
put it on two pants then

1892.46 --> 1895.659
and that worked great

1896.0 --> 1901.039
don't need much to make a good sauce

1898.179 --> 1904.0590000000002
well you make you need

1901.039 --> 1904.059
a lot of effort

1905.059 --> 1910.12
just take quite some work to get it

1907.88 --> 1910.1200000000001
right

1912.799 --> 1916.84
right what I do first is

1917.419 --> 1926.0590000000002
first the onions

1920.559 --> 1928.899
the carrots garlic olive oil

1926.059 --> 1932.059
oregano

1928.899 --> 1935.7199999999998
uh and bouillon

1932.059 --> 1937.279
like bricks that have yeah go in between

1935.72 --> 1940.88
there

1937.279 --> 1943.58
let that like bake not too hard keep

1940.88 --> 1946.279
stirring it in the meantime cut up like

1943.58 --> 1948.9189999999999
all the other vegetables

1946.279 --> 1952.159
then cook water

1948.919 --> 1954.919
to get the skin off the tomatoes

1952.159 --> 1957.6200000000001
pour the cooking water over it

1954.919 --> 1961.8200000000002
right and then yeah crush it in there

1957.62 --> 1965.2399999999998
and then yeah let that

1961.82 --> 1967.6399999999999
keep that bubbling for a bit and then

1965.24 --> 1970.059
eventually add the the zucchini and the

1967.64 --> 1970.0590000000002
eggplant

1970.46 --> 1973.299
it's really great

1976.52 --> 1981.3799999999999
like after that point I just keep it

1978.74 --> 1984.98
bubbling a very low

1981.38 --> 1988.3990000000001
yeah low gas

1984.98 --> 1993.34
to just keep it bubbling slowly while I

1988.399 --> 1993.34
then start cooking the uh this the pasta

1996.74 --> 2001.72
it works great

1998.179 --> 2004.539
I would puree the carrot no I would not

2001.72 --> 2006.039
no I cut it in little yeah that's why

2004.539 --> 2008.44
it's so much work

2006.039 --> 2009.76
basically the carrots are pretty big I

2008.44 --> 2011.14
cut them

2009.76 --> 2013.539
into

2011.14 --> 2017.38
yeah pork Waters

2013.539 --> 2020.08
and then cut them into slices so there's

2017.38 --> 2022.2990000000002
like those little triangles that come

2020.08 --> 2025.0
out of it basically with the with the

2022.299 --> 2027.94
curved the curved triangles yeah

2025.0 --> 2031.019
my care I cut my my carrots into curved

2027.94 --> 2031.019
triangles that's right

2031.36 --> 2037.4189999999999
but it's great because if you then

2033.64 --> 2040.6000000000001
pretty early on start eating it then it

2037.419 --> 2044.46
it it's not hard at all at the end

2040.6 --> 2044.4599999999998
and it's yeah it works great

2045.7 --> 2052.8
that butter makes everything better uh

2049.0 --> 2052.8
no not everything

2054.099 --> 2060.839
well I like butter though I mean

2056.679 --> 2060.839
if I can I will like

2062.5 --> 2066.82
fry

2063.879 --> 2068.859
I will use it on most Meats especially

2066.82 --> 2071.3990000000003
chicken

2068.859 --> 2071.399
all right

2077.32 --> 2083.28
okay Alexander Swedish yeah sure hey

2080.32 --> 2083.28
whatever works for you

2084.3 --> 2090.7000000000003
what yeah when when it comes to like

2086.98 --> 2093.099
cooking overall yeah butter is great

2090.7 --> 2096.04
but also olive oil it's like butter

2093.099 --> 2099.4
olive oil those are the two

2096.04 --> 2102.82
foundations that I use I don't I pretty

2099.4 --> 2105.6600000000003
much don't use any other type of fat

2102.82 --> 2105.6600000000003
for cooking

2108.339 --> 2114.359
yeah yeah yeah classical homeopath I get

2110.68 --> 2114.359
it that was the joke

2124.5 --> 2128.14
Lord

2126.28 --> 2130.3590000000004
it's hard for cooking that's funny

2128.14 --> 2133.72
Alexander Swedish because I do have like

2130.359 --> 2135.2799999999997
a web self-made tradition where I make

2133.72 --> 2137.74
hamburgers

2135.28 --> 2140.44
and I start that out with olive oil so I

2137.74 --> 2145.0789999999997
make I bake the hamburgers in

2140.44 --> 2145.079
olive oil with the onion rings together

2146.859 --> 2151.06
and then

2148.96 --> 2153.52
like yeah

2151.06 --> 2157.72
yeah if you keep reusing that and I do

2153.52 --> 2159.64
like I pour the fat into like a separate

2157.72 --> 2162.339
little container

2159.64 --> 2165.0989999999997
or if you keep recycling that and no

2162.339 --> 2168.04
that's not bad that works great you have

2165.099 --> 2170.1400000000003
recycling fat especially any animal fat

2168.04 --> 2173.38
works great

2170.14 --> 2176.68
just don't let it rot by yeah having

2173.38 --> 2178.2400000000002
water in there or something right you

2176.68 --> 2180.52
have to get prevent it from getting

2178.24 --> 2182.2599999999998
moist

2180.52 --> 2184.96
so you can't keep it in the fridge

2182.26 --> 2187.9
because then it will get moist

2184.96 --> 2190.7200000000003
right uh

2187.9 --> 2192.7000000000003
but yeah the more I use it the more it

2190.72 --> 2195.22
just kind of becomes solid and well

2192.7 --> 2197.859
olive oil is naturally not solid so

2195.22 --> 2200.7999999999997
that's basically all just hamburger Lark

2197.859 --> 2202.24
that I keep reusing and it works great

2200.8 --> 2206.88
loving it

2202.24 --> 2206.8799999999997
and like you can reuse that a lot

2208.72 --> 2215.339
like without it becoming like

2211.359 --> 2215.339
like burdensome on my system

2219.46 --> 2221.46
um

2230.68 --> 2233.22
what

2234.099 --> 2238.54
chicken broth weird

2240.099 --> 2244.839
okay

2242.619 --> 2247.44
well I typically don't like to combine

2244.839 --> 2247.44
Meats

2250.24 --> 2256.5989999999997
so yeah

2253.24 --> 2258.7
I keep I keep it separate it's not my

2256.599 --> 2261.8
thing

2258.7 --> 2261.7999999999997
[Music]

2262.06 --> 2269.92
right technically I yeah

2265.839 --> 2274.0
I try to overall avoid a bit it's like

2269.92 --> 2276.46
if you just bake beef in butter that's

2274.0 --> 2278.8
bad news

2276.46 --> 2281.38
like even though it can taste nice it's

2278.8 --> 2282.579
like bad on the system

2281.38 --> 2285.579
so

2282.579 --> 2288.099
on my intestines so what I do then is I

2285.579 --> 2289.6600000000003
just add a little olive oil next to the

2288.099 --> 2292.119
butter and then it might still be

2289.66 --> 2293.74
predominantly butter and then works a

2292.119 --> 2296.92
lot better

2293.74 --> 2301.54
but uh I don't know

2296.92 --> 2301.54
today is a cooking show apparently

2307.0 --> 2311.38
butter and olive oil

2308.859 --> 2314.02
and Inter you mean are interchangeable

2311.38 --> 2316.26
no no they're not they were completely

2314.02 --> 2316.2599999999998
different

2321.22 --> 2324.4199999999996
and they taste different

2329.22 --> 2332.6
[Music]

2333.7 --> 2342.04
but if you take like the the

2337.42 --> 2344.8
olive oil that's what do you call that

2342.04 --> 2346.839
yeah where they take the olive

2344.8 --> 2350.94
taste out of it

2346.839 --> 2350.94
that combines just fine with butter

2351.579 --> 2356.5600000000004
right but for spaghetti I don't do that

2353.74 --> 2359.2
I want the olive oil to actually taste

2356.56 --> 2362.4
like olive oil it makes it makes the

2359.2 --> 2362.3999999999996
spaghetti sauce a lot better

2366.16 --> 2371.02
all right so I take the virgin olive oil

2368.619 --> 2373.359
for that

2371.02 --> 2376.359
but yeah to combine that with butter

2373.359 --> 2379.5
it's just it did I don't know it just

2376.359 --> 2379.5
makes no sense to me

2381.82 --> 2384.82
whatever

2417.099 --> 2419.94
okay

2426.01 --> 2430.48
[Music]

2428.68 --> 2433.2999999999997
right so is this what we're going to

2430.48 --> 2435.4
talk about today cooking or does anybody

2433.3 --> 2438.78
have something else to

2435.4 --> 2438.78
for me to dig into

2470.32 --> 2476.8
you forgot to put the word bitter into

2473.02 --> 2480.04
that sentence flatten the Curve

2476.8 --> 2484.3
we're just gonna skip

2480.04 --> 2484.3
that whatever right

2489.579 --> 2494.04
so come on guys give me something

2505.96 --> 2508.96
foreign

2517.72 --> 2522.16
everything

2519.7 --> 2526.4199999999996
it's all flat

2522.16 --> 2531.48
is Dr Bess here uh

2526.42 --> 2531.48
no not that I've seen thus far

2536.98 --> 2539.16
foreign

2539.56 --> 2544.24
yeah

2540.96 --> 2546.16
yeah you need

2544.24 --> 2549.64
a flat plane

2546.16 --> 2551.2
in order to make a map using Celestial

2549.64 --> 2553.48
navigation

2551.2 --> 2558.339
to make the map project you need that

2553.48 --> 2560.859
flat Baseline and the angle to Polaris

2558.339 --> 2563.7999999999997
that Nathan can roll out this whole

2560.859 --> 2566.44
thing a lot better than I can but I

2563.8 --> 2569.079
definitely get the gist of it so yeah

2566.44 --> 2571.42
Flat Earth proof

2569.079 --> 2574.2400000000002
the Earth wasn't flat

2571.42 --> 2578.339
then we wouldn't have Celestial

2574.24 --> 2578.339
navigation and the maps that we do

2578.44 --> 2584.14
we do have the maps that we use

2581.98 --> 2587.819
and we can use Celestial navigation

2584.14 --> 2587.819
therefore the Earth is flat

2588.59 --> 2594.7690000000002
[Music]

2604.56 --> 2609.339
[Music]

2607.0 --> 2611.44
right

2609.339 --> 2613.9
what's really yeah I try to ask a

2611.44 --> 2616.3
question even yesterday to Nathan but he

2613.9 --> 2618.04
just would not answer at all maybe he

2616.3 --> 2620.98
thought I was trying to like ball win

2618.04 --> 2622.3
him or something I wasn't

2620.98 --> 2624.22
because

2622.3 --> 2626.8
it's just that

2624.22 --> 2628.54
I had trouble connecting up the the

2626.8 --> 2631.0
references

2628.54 --> 2633.64
so like a GP

2631.0 --> 2637.06
of a star is basically where that star

2633.64 --> 2641.16
would be straight above you

2637.06 --> 2641.16
that's what I wanted to confirm but

2648.339 --> 2651.64
it's just interesting how that works

2650.38 --> 2654.46
like

2651.64 --> 2657.4
that the maps and for Celestial

2654.46 --> 2660.16
navigation are basically like the Flat

2657.4 --> 2662.56
Earth and the celestial sphere but the

2660.16 --> 2666.339
celestial sphere is made into its own

2662.56 --> 2671.56
map it's basically unfolded how

2666.339 --> 2676.56
by just referencing every point on the

2671.56 --> 2676.56
surface where a star is directly above

2679.48 --> 2684.579
right and since Polaris is the only one

2682.06 --> 2686.56
that doesn't like move through the

2684.579 --> 2690.0600000000004
apparent rotation

2686.56 --> 2694.18
that one is is always at the right spot

2690.06 --> 2695.619
so yeah GP Polaris straight above a flat

2694.18 --> 2699.3999999999996
plane

2695.619 --> 2702.46
and yeah the celestial map is made into

2699.4 --> 2704.579
an into a flat plane that parallels the

2702.46 --> 2704.579
Earth

2705.339 --> 2712.42
the flat plane Earth yeah so it's so

2709.119 --> 2716.44
flat that the celestial apparent sphere

2712.42 --> 2719.7400000000002
is then transformed into a flat plane

2716.44 --> 2722.44
that parallels the Flat Earth

2719.74 --> 2724.54
in order for you to have a functional

2722.44 --> 2728.94
star map

2724.54 --> 2728.94
is that Flat Earth proof enough for you

2729.16 --> 2732.5989999999997
hey Adam making

2734.26 --> 2740.079
right GP land position starts yeah that

2737.2 --> 2742.1189999999997
I thought that

2740.079 --> 2742.4
so yeah that's what I'm just talking

2742.119 --> 2745.53
about

2742.4 --> 2745.53
[Music]

2748.599 --> 2752.55
all right

2749.43 --> 2752.5499999999997
[Music]

2754.0 --> 2760.48
where can I see a video of a ship being

2756.88 --> 2763.6600000000003
zoomed back from the horizon

2760.48 --> 2768.54
who cares

2763.66 --> 2768.54
yeah we don't care what like

2768.9 --> 2775.2400000000002
how do you [ __ ] even describe this

2772.06 --> 2778.66
what certain categories of flat earthers

2775.24 --> 2780.64
have been saying since 2015.

2778.66 --> 2783.3999999999996
popular

2780.64 --> 2786.64
phrase oh you can zoom in back on the

2783.4 --> 2788.14
ship at the Horizon which in a way is

2786.64 --> 2789.2799999999997
true

2788.14 --> 2793.1189999999997
right

2789.28 --> 2796.0
but it's not a full-blown explanation it

2793.119 --> 2798.04
doesn't explain how curvature

2796.0 --> 2801.46
calculation completely excludes

2798.04 --> 2803.46
perspective for example

2801.46 --> 2807.579
right it doesn't address

2803.46 --> 2810.2200000000003
the the bad corrupted nature of the

2807.579 --> 2812.6800000000003
globe calculations in the first place

2810.22 --> 2814.839
so it's a poor argument it's like oh no

2812.68 --> 2817.5
we oh we can explain it

2814.839 --> 2817.5
but it

2817.66 --> 2821.98
it doesn't really explain it all that

2819.52 --> 2823.18
well it doesn't actually counter the

2821.98 --> 2827.079
assumption

2823.18 --> 2830.319
of a ship disappearing into the Horizon

2827.079 --> 2832.9
because it's alleged to go over a

2830.319 --> 2835.18
physical curve blocking it

2832.9 --> 2836.8
it doesn't address that and how that is

2835.18 --> 2838.7799999999997
being calculated

2836.8 --> 2839.44
right so you know we zoom in it comes

2838.78 --> 2842.079
back

2839.44 --> 2845.64
doesn't address much so it's it's not a

2842.079 --> 2845.6400000000003
really helpful argument for anything

2850.359 --> 2854.56
yeah even though there's definitely

2852.52 --> 2857.859
examples of it

2854.56 --> 2860.619
right so thanks

2857.859 --> 2863.04
seeking star water for finding one of

2860.619 --> 2863.04
those videos

2870.52 --> 2875.079
yeah definitely

2872.98 --> 2878.94
started zoomed in

2875.079 --> 2878.94
zoom out and like after

2879.839 --> 2884.56
27 seconds you literally cannot see it

2883.18 --> 2887.98
anymore

2884.56 --> 2890.7599999999998
not because it's gone over a curve but

2887.98 --> 2890.76
simply because

2891.819 --> 2898.14
it the resolution

2895.06 --> 2898.14
it's become too low

2899.38 --> 2905.38
for the yeah for the field of view to

2902.319 --> 2908.619
pick it up to register it

2905.38 --> 2911.079
so there you go

2908.619 --> 2913.78
yeah that's right no calculations needed

2911.079 --> 2916.3
just watch yeah just watch the link

2913.78 --> 2918.8190000000004
that's seeking star water posted yeah

2916.3 --> 2920.6800000000003
just watch that link yeah

2918.819 --> 2924.94
she posted

2920.68 --> 2927.94
uh yeah what you were requesting huh

2924.94 --> 2930.28
what you're denying there not true

2927.94 --> 2933.96
except for the link which absolutely

2930.28 --> 2933.96
shows you exactly that

2935.22 --> 2938.52

and it's immediately proven palpably

2992.98 --> 2998.8
clickably proven wrong

about that yeah because we immediately

3001.8 --> 3007.44
proved you wrong

3004.56 --> 3009.599
and then oh oh I'm gonna complain about

dumb statement

3054.78 --> 3061.3390000000004
in support of your globe and then be

3057.54 --> 3065.099
immediately proven wrong with a link

3061.339 --> 3066.839
that literally tells you

3065.099 --> 3069.54

3121.319 --> 3127.92
hey steamy traveler troll time again

3123.66 --> 3130.3799999999997
yeah yeah that's a troll [ __ ] just now

3127.92 --> 3134.52
thought it was cool to say who show me

3130.38 --> 3137.04
this video of about being zoomed in

3134.52 --> 3139.2
when it went over the horizon yeah and

3137.04 --> 3142.5
seeking star water literally the next

3139.2 --> 3145.64
sentence posted a link to a video that

3142.5 --> 3145.64
did exactly that

3146.4 --> 3151.8
and then they shut up for a second and

3148.8 --> 3154.26
they waited until well I got a little

3151.8 --> 3158.2200000000003
impatient and starting slight ad homing

3154.26 --> 3160.1400000000003
so they could immediately deviate and

3158.22 --> 3162.0
start pointing out oh I'm hoping now

3160.14 --> 3164.94
instead of addressing that they were

3162.0 --> 3169.74
utterly crushed

3164.94 --> 3169.7400000000002
with visual proof instantaneously

3170.04 --> 3174.66
to completely negate their [ __ ]

3172.74 --> 3175.9799999999996
assumption

3174.66 --> 3181.3999999999996
yeah

3175.98 --> 3181.4
[ __ ] morons you pathetic little [ __ ]

3191.46 --> 3197.579
yeah the video is crappy oh yes oh wow

3194.88 --> 3199.859
it's crappy it's a crappy video that

3197.579 --> 3204.3
that disproves

3199.859 --> 3206.22
it right I mean it's so pixelated man

3204.3 --> 3209.6400000000003
dude seek from Star Wars couldn't you

3206.22 --> 3211.7599999999998
find any video that was higher than

3209.64 --> 3216.0
what is it

3211.76 --> 3218.76
256 resolution oh wait no it was just a

3216.0 --> 3222.68
full on resolution

3218.76 --> 3222.6800000000003
it was a full resolution video

3222.78 --> 3228.98
yeah not crappy pretty focused p p 1000

3226.44 --> 3228.98
footage

3229.859 --> 3233.359
not crappy very clear

3242.28 --> 3247.8
it's not I know it's painful to be

3244.38 --> 3250.44
blatantly obviously wrong

3247.8 --> 3252.3590000000004
to the point where you can confirm it

3250.44 --> 3254.28
yourself

3252.359 --> 3259.0789999999997
and there's nothing you can do about

3254.28 --> 3261.96
that you were wrong except admit defeat

3259.079 --> 3265.4
but you can't do that because you're too

3261.96 --> 3265.4
Petty to do that

3265.559 --> 3272.78
you're too immature

3268.8 --> 3275.3390000000004
to admit when you are blatantly wrong

3272.78 --> 3278.099
yeah an adult

3275.339 --> 3280.68
would that would catch themselves in a

3278.099 --> 3284.339
mistake like that would be like oh

3280.68 --> 3287.16
oh oops well that sucks I guess I have

3284.339 --> 3290.2799999999997
to rethink that one right like that time

3287.16 --> 3293.46
when I suddenly realized that

3290.28 --> 3296.0400000000004
hologram doesn't actually

3293.46 --> 3298.02
etymologically mean image of light it

3296.04 --> 3300.18
was really embarrassing very painful I

3298.02 --> 3302.94
got in a bad mood because of that when I

3300.18 --> 3307.52
discovered that everybody remembers here

3302.94 --> 3311.52
yeah and it immediately admitted it yeah

3307.52 --> 3314.099
and I adapt to knowing that I was wrong

3311.52 --> 3315.96
so that I don't repeat it like a [ __ ]

3314.099 --> 3318.0
little [ __ ]

3315.96 --> 3320.94
spam bot

3318.0 --> 3323.339
has no life and keeps regurgitating the

3320.94 --> 3326.579
same crap arguments that aren't

3323.339 --> 3330.0589999999997
arguments from seven years ago that

3326.579 --> 3331.8590000000004
we've overthrown countered seven years

3330.059 --> 3334.1400000000003
ago

3331.859 --> 3336.54
I mean we can counter and overthrow them

3334.14 --> 3338.8799999999997
much more easily much more refined now

3336.54 --> 3340.68
because we totally get how this thing

3338.88 --> 3343.02
works now thanks to understanding

3340.68 --> 3345.5989999999997
Celestial navigation among other things

3343.02 --> 3347.579
yeah the curvature calculated geometry

3345.599 --> 3349.02
how that works yeah we figured it all

3347.579 --> 3351.3590000000004
out

3349.02 --> 3354.0
so now we can counter those same

3351.359 --> 3355.859
disproven arguments from seven or eight

3354.0 --> 3359.819
years ago now

3355.859 --> 3361.859
even better you keep regurgitating that

3359.819 --> 3366.44
same [ __ ] over and over again though

3361.859 --> 3366.44
like a [ __ ] stuck little record

3366.72 --> 3371.18
little [ __ ] record you just keep stuck

3372.599 --> 3377.2200000000003
same crap over and over again

3375.359 --> 3380.7599999999998
no updates

3377.22 --> 3384.74
nothing just the same stupid little

3380.76 --> 3384.7400000000002
record player over and over again

3384.9 --> 3389.04
yeah

3386.579 --> 3392.6400000000003
I bet he's just gonna find another chat

3389.04 --> 3394.68
and start whining about how boats

3392.64 --> 3396.54
go over the rise and then there is no

3394.68 --> 3399.24
video

3396.54 --> 3401.4
to zoom in right like that that there

3399.24 --> 3403.859
isn't any he's just gonna say the same

3401.4 --> 3406.98
crap again

3403.859 --> 3410.16
because that [ __ ] has no life he's a

3406.98 --> 3412.68
[ __ ] [ __ ] and he's unredeemably

3410.16 --> 3415.04
stupid

3412.68 --> 3417.96
that's a person that's so [ __ ] stupid

3415.04 --> 3420.9
they'd probably get themselves killed

3417.96 --> 3423.48
because of that

3420.9 --> 3425.1600000000003
because they're so [ __ ] stupid

3423.48 --> 3427.44
if you keep making the same same

3425.16 --> 3429.7799999999997
mistakes over and over again that's

3427.44 --> 3432.3
going to get you killed at some point

3429.78 --> 3435.7400000000002
you know that I know that looking

3432.3 --> 3435.7400000000002
forward to it you [ __ ] with

3452.339 --> 3455.119
ah

3457.74 --> 3461.2999999999997
right enough though

3461.339 --> 3467.24
but yeah thanks for that link sequence

3463.8 --> 3467.2400000000002
tower that was perfect timing

3479.099 --> 3482.839
all right so back to business

3485.28 --> 3487.46
um

3488.819 --> 3491.359
foreign

3516.98 --> 3523.38
and by the way if you want to see

3519.559 --> 3524.8390000000004
miraging effects that Ballers falsely

3523.38 --> 3528.0
claim

3524.839 --> 3530.2799999999997
is boats going

3528.0 --> 3531.72
Over the Horizon because something is

3530.28 --> 3534.44
blocking it right

3531.72 --> 3534.4399999999996
well

3536.04 --> 3541.68
this is filmed over a proven

3539.819 --> 3544.68
Lake

3541.68 --> 3547.2
piece of Flat Water yeah

3544.68 --> 3549.839
proven measured flat

3547.2 --> 3552.1189999999997
and guess what visual effects still

3549.839 --> 3556.2
happen so check that out if you want

3552.119 --> 3557.2200000000003
some expansion on boats not going over a

3556.2 --> 3560.24
curve

3557.22 --> 3560.24
and there you go

3562.079 --> 3567.3590000000004
it's all about how Optics work has

3565.619 --> 3570.42
nothing to do with something physical

3567.359 --> 3572.66
blocking the thing that you're seeing in

3570.42 --> 3572.66
the distance

3589.64 --> 3593.64
so yeah it's a five minute video pretty

3592.26 --> 3597.2990000000004
cool

3593.64 --> 3602.0
I was like Sky Freeze videos they're so

3597.299 --> 3605.299
simple so just focused and very

3602.0 --> 3605.299
carefully made

3607.02 --> 3609.799
like it

3625.319 --> 3630.24
right so what do we talk about next

3628.91 --> 3633.319
[Music]

3630.24 --> 3633.319
I think the uh

3633.96 --> 3637.819

3663.48 --> 3666.44
are you skeptic

3667.98 --> 3672.38
Dr Bass or c

I mean your your socks are going

3693.24 --> 3697.9199999999996
straight into the wire

3695.339 --> 3701.52

3697.92 --> 3704.28
message like some weird neurotic freak

3701.52 --> 3706.2599999999998
it doesn't matter

3704.28 --> 3709.2200000000003
it's just going to be immediately

3706.26 --> 3709.2200000000003
deleted

3709.74 --> 3717.859

followed me over the years

4883.159 --> 4886.159
uh

4888.679 --> 4893.659
had some interesting live streams on by

something

4897.26 --> 4901.159000000001

from South America somewhere I don't

even remember

4915.92 --> 4921.14
he was kind of wealthy and he seemed

decently interesting but overall it's

4921.14 --> 4926.56
just like I never really liked globuster

4923.36 --> 4926.5599999999995
setup it was just

4931.58 --> 4935.42
like I don't like what they do I think

4933.92 --> 4937.4
it's boring I think they just keep

4935.42 --> 4940.88
sucking up to each other

like I was a little bit engaged when

4959.96 --> 4965.12
they were talking about how

4962.179 --> 4968.06
Jets might be using vacuum engines that

4965.12 --> 4969.679
don't actually use or consume fuel or

4968.06 --> 4972.8
barely any

4969.679 --> 4975.32
oh and by the way for some weird reason

4972.8 --> 4978.9400000000005
weird ass reason Owen Benjamin

4975.32 --> 4978.94
completely backtracked on that

4979.219 --> 4985.04
because he even got on that for a while

4982.46 --> 4987.08
but now apparently somebody told him

4985.04 --> 4989.78
yeah there's all this giant fuel

4987.08 --> 4991.34
storages underneath the airport all

4989.78 --> 4994.12
right

4991.34 --> 4994.12
sure

4999.02 --> 5004.659000000001

5001.48 --> 5007.9
fueled trucks to refuel them right every

5004.659 --> 5009.879999999999
day no

5007.9 --> 5012.879999999999
I highly doubt that

5009.88 --> 5016.32
so but that was interesting when they

5012.88 --> 5016.32
brought that forward for a bit

5021.4 --> 5026.259999999999
but yeah that's

5023.8 --> 5028.0
that's like the last interesting thing

5026.26 --> 5029.4400000000005
that I even remember that came from

5028.0 --> 5032.38
globusters

5029.44 --> 5033.699
after that it's just ether garbage and

5032.38 --> 5036.96

5186.82 --> 5190.32
solid link UPS to

5190.78 --> 5198.42
data research about that specifically

5194.32 --> 5201.34
the other whole the other lines I have

5198.42 --> 5203.62
of research for that is German new

5201.34 --> 5205.3

5203.62 --> 5206.32
how that works the model of it in

5205.3 --> 5209.1990000000005
general

5206.32 --> 5212.0199999999995

5209.199 --> 5215.32
terrain Theory even though it kind of

5212.02 --> 5218.9800000000005
basically ignores a lot it ignores

5215.32 --> 5220.9
microbiology entirely pretty much but so

5218.98 --> 5223.32
there's different types of approaches

5220.9 --> 5223.32
for

5227.26 --> 5231.820000000001
for a model on how to deal with your

5231.82 --> 5236.44
understand what what is actually

5233.86 --> 5238.0
happening how you should conceive of

there might be some Trails somewhere

5352.78 --> 5358.179
right

5354.52 --> 5360.9400000000005
the big point is is that before 95 it

5358.179 --> 5363.46
wasn't standardized

5360.94 --> 5365.0199999999995
and it's been Declassified that there

5363.46 --> 5368.5
are like

weather experiments using planes dumping

5368.5 --> 5371.739
particulates

5369.76 --> 5373.780000000001
in their mid different forms and this

5371.739 --> 5376.419999999999
has been around for like

5373.78 --> 5379.84
is it 80 years or something a long time

5376.42 --> 5381.76
and it's like on record yeah we had they

5379.84 --> 5384.1
have tested it

5381.76 --> 5386.4400000000005
on record so

5384.1 --> 5388.54
but yeah that doesn't mean that they

5386.44 --> 5391.199
then started doing that all the time

5388.54 --> 5391.199
they didn't

5392.199 --> 5399.36
the standardization came

5394.96 --> 5404.1
in 95. very specifically

5399.36 --> 5404.099999999999
95 when it started

5409.02 --> 5419.26
[Music]

5416.86 --> 5422.82
who are the missions in the Illuminati

5419.26 --> 5422.820000000001
Linked UP barely

5431.8 --> 5436.42
I mean you could consider that

5433.96 --> 5439.2390000000005
Illuminati was like a secret society

5436.42 --> 5441.46
within a secret society

5439.239 --> 5443.199
there were people that were part of

5441.46 --> 5445.96
sacred societies

5443.199 --> 5449.28
that were conspiring another layer

5445.96 --> 5449.28
within right I mean

5453.04 --> 5456.06
that's what happens

5479.62 --> 5484.48
yeah I know guns in there yeah I would I

5482.02 --> 5487.2390000000005
was right on top of that like in early

5484.48 --> 5491.218999999999
2000s

5487.239 --> 5491.218999999999
that's when I started to figure that out

5491.38 --> 5498.639
I was really hurt by the discovery that

5495.699 --> 5502.239
they're doing that really hurt

5498.639 --> 5503.92
and so I have somewhat

5502.239 --> 5506.739
put it in the background because it's

5503.92 --> 5508.96
just too burdensome to think about that

5506.739 --> 5512.08
they're oh they're poisoning because it

5508.96 --> 5515.8
is over drama dramified it is

5512.08 --> 5518.62
it's not that bad if it would have been

5515.8 --> 5521.92
we would all be dead everything would be

5518.62 --> 5524.86
dead now yeah 25 years of spraying

5521.92 --> 5527.38
absolute poison that means everything

5524.86 --> 5529.839999999999
would be dead now

5527.38 --> 5533.679
it isn't

5529.84 --> 5537.34
one has to draw a conclusion

5533.679 --> 5541.12
it was probably over exaggeratedly

5537.34 --> 5544.54
presented at the time to get attention

5541.12 --> 5546.699
like this is happening

5544.54 --> 5550.06
like alarmism

5546.699 --> 5552.4
not irrational levels of alarmism of

5550.06 --> 5555.46
something that should definitely be

5552.4 --> 5557.94
put into the Public's attention

5555.46 --> 5557.94
right

5558.76 --> 5565.659000000001
because that is what happened a lot

5562.84 --> 5569.02
something is discovered it has fast

5565.659 --> 5571.12
implications but if you just show it as

5569.02 --> 5573.820000000001
is then everybody's just gonna not see

5571.12 --> 5577.239
it and move past it so what do you do

5573.82 --> 5579.159
you do the maximum dire outcome and you

5577.239 --> 5580.78
put an image together like that with

5579.159 --> 5583.599999999999
that to like

exaggerated it's just the snap people

5594.46 --> 5598.8
doing in the past successfully

5599.739 --> 5606.419999999999
but it is in ways an exaggeration just

5603.219 --> 5606.42
to get people's attention

5607.54 --> 5610.86
that's how I see it now

the true control their part of that

5644.199 --> 5650.4
trick is to be

5646.96 --> 5650.4
like undetectable

5651.159 --> 5657.04
they're not going to be all riched up

5653.38 --> 5659.62
and harsh looking and then

5657.04 --> 5663.159
try to hide while doing it that's not

5659.62 --> 5665.82
what they are they are per people that

5663.159 --> 5665.82
blend in

5667.9 --> 5673.0599999999995
just because they have power doesn't

5670.12 --> 5675.58
mean that they need to show it off like

5673.06 --> 5678.96
a peacock every single time the real

5675.58 --> 5678.96
controllers don't do that

5686.8 --> 5691.179
yeah

5688.719 --> 5695.32
I mean those people that do that are

5691.179 --> 5697.36
just turned into lightning rods

5695.32 --> 5699.28
because they catch everybody's attention

5697.36 --> 5701.5599999999995
and they want everybody's attention and

5699.28 --> 5703.48
then it's very convenient scapegoat to

5701.56 --> 5705.280000000001
say ah bearing control

5703.48 --> 5706.78
because everybody's getting shoved in

5705.28 --> 5708.699
their face with it and if you shove

5706.78 --> 5712.12
things enough in people's face

5708.699 --> 5714.638999999999
then those people tend over time

5712.12 --> 5716.26
statistically start to believe that the

5714.639 --> 5719.26
thing that is getting shot in their face

5716.26 --> 5721.54
is their God roughly said

5719.26 --> 5723.46
that it is in power that's what people

5721.54 --> 5724.9
start believing because they're [ __ ]

5723.46 --> 5727.2390000000005
[ __ ]

5724.9 --> 5729.759999999999
although they wouldn't be if they just

5727.239 --> 5732.879999999999
had a world where they weren't

5729.76 --> 5735.219
constantly psychologically derailed

5732.88 --> 5736.42
through misinformation and psychological

5735.219 --> 5739.0
warfare

5736.42 --> 5740.8
right but we are so they will be

5739.0 --> 5742.96
[ __ ] about it

5740.8 --> 5746.26
the system is in place you get to see

5742.96 --> 5748.92
the worst freaks ever get shoved in your

5746.26 --> 5752.38
face they get everybody points at them

5748.92 --> 5755.139
while the actual people in power are

5752.38 --> 5758.34
completely Anonymous and you will not

5755.139 --> 5758.34
figure out who they are

5764.8 --> 5769.96
what is it in Chemtrails well there are

5767.86 --> 5771.82
things in it allegedly

5769.96 --> 5774.58
that have been

5771.82 --> 5776.92
Sam measurements of the material

5774.58 --> 5780.88
allegedly way back

5776.92 --> 5783.34
and it was said to contain barium salts

5780.88 --> 5785.92
aluminum

5783.34 --> 5788.26
dioxide

5785.92 --> 5790.0
and

5788.26 --> 5793.26
yeah that was the primary ingredient

5790.0 --> 5793.26
some other stuff maybe

5794.02 --> 5798.06
right

5795.4 --> 5798.0599999999995
but

5799.6 --> 5807.280000000001
if that would be what they always spray

5803.32 --> 5810.639
always every time then after 25 years of

5807.28 --> 5812.0199999999995
global spraying we would all be dead

5810.639 --> 5814.78
we're not

5812.02 --> 5815.8
so we have to conclude that it hasn't

5814.78 --> 5818.28
been

5815.8 --> 5821.92
constant aluminum

5818.28 --> 5824.5
dioxide and barium salt spray it

5821.92 --> 5826.7390000000005
couldn't have been that or we'd all be

5824.5 --> 5826.739
dead

5827.82 --> 5833.5
like everything would be dead now not

5831.159 --> 5835.599999999999
just a little everything would be dead

5833.5 --> 5839.62
there would be no more plants growing

5835.6 --> 5843.04
the soil would be completely poison

5839.62 --> 5845.199
everywhere everything would be dead 25

5843.04 --> 5847.739
years of constant spraying that [ __ ]

5845.199 --> 5850.48
everything would be dead

5847.739 --> 5852.58
absolutely no doubt

5850.48 --> 5855.099999999999
so it isn't that's not what they've been

5852.58 --> 5858.46
doing continually that is the conclusion

5855.1 --> 5861.84
that you must draw

5858.46 --> 5861.84
or you're an idiot

5865.96 --> 5870.82
right that it doesn't mean that they've

5868.0 --> 5873.04
never done it I'm sure they do they

5870.82 --> 5875.08
might designate certain areas that they

5873.04 --> 5877.84
just want to destroy and then they

5875.08 --> 5880.78
specifically spray that [ __ ]

5877.84 --> 5882.6990000000005
but it's not Global it's Global it's not

5880.78 --> 5887.219
everywhere in the world that they do

5882.699 --> 5887.219
that can't be or it would all be dead

5888.76 --> 5893.219
right so they I do actually think they

5891.219 --> 5895.96
have probably

5893.219 --> 5899.08
perfected the substances that they can

5895.96 --> 5901.0
use particulates that they do spray I

5899.08 --> 5904.179
kind of hope that it's just silicon that

5901.0 --> 5905.699
they're just using sand dust right which

5904.179 --> 5909.88
before

5905.699 --> 5912.04
Chemtrails was part of the natural cycle

5909.88 --> 5914.56
like the winds from the Sahara would

5912.04 --> 5916.719
bring the fine dust and that would kind

5914.56 --> 5918.639
of like add

5916.719 --> 5921.219
elements to the weather

5918.639 --> 5923.9800000000005
etc etc so I hope like maybe they're

5921.219 --> 5925.96
using that they're just spraying that

5923.98 --> 5928.259999999999
stuff to kind of create clouds cloud

5925.96 --> 5931.2390000000005
seeding not

5928.26 --> 5934.7390000000005
poisonous substances like barium salts

5931.239 --> 5934.739
and aluminum dioxide

5935.739 --> 5940.919999999999
because if they've been doing that

5937.54 --> 5940.92
everything would be dead

5942.72 --> 5945.879
[Music]

5946.42 --> 5951.12
what on Earth are they spraying what

5948.46 --> 5951.12
yeah I know

5953.08 --> 5958.719
dude I've met people

5956.139 --> 5962.139
that are in those movies Guns of

5958.719 --> 5965.679
Navarone literally I've had conferences

5962.139 --> 5968.86
together like secret meetings talking

5965.679 --> 5970.36
about this stuff like before those

5968.86 --> 5973.139999999999
movies were made

5970.36 --> 5974.739
people that are in those movies I've met

5973.14 --> 5977.679
[Music]

5974.739 --> 5980.94
yeah I know it was really awesome 2010

5977.679 --> 5980.9400000000005
what a what a year

5991.739 --> 5995.04
where is it

5998.679 --> 6004.1
oh

6000.98 --> 6004.099999999999
my God

6009.9 --> 6014.04
okay

6011.699 --> 6016.82
I'm pretty sure I do have the original

6014.04 --> 6016.82
DVD

6019.08 --> 6024.12
did I just download it anyway it's still

6022.02 --> 6026.360000000001
somewhere on my computer I think but

6024.12 --> 6026.36
yeah

6035.699 --> 6041.339999999999
the funny thing by the way is that even

6037.92 --> 6042.6
then in 2010 I was saying this sort of

6041.34 --> 6045.78
thing like

6042.6 --> 6048.360000000001
are you absolutely certain

6045.78 --> 6050.4
have you confirmed that all the time

6048.36 --> 6053.699
every time they spray it is that

6050.4 --> 6056.82
substance because that would literally

6053.699 --> 6060.419999999999
be palpable it would kill nature and it

6056.82 --> 6063.659
would not get any less over time

6060.42 --> 6066.02
and even back then in 2010 I was like

6063.659 --> 6066.0199999999995
hey

6066.54 --> 6071.219
are you sure they're actually always

6068.76 --> 6072.2390000000005
praying that or does it work slightly

6071.219 --> 6074.52
different

6072.239 --> 6076.739
it's really cool thinking back about

6074.52 --> 6081.139
that that it was even already on to that

6076.739 --> 6081.138999999999
like 13 years ago

6087.719 --> 6092.82
I'm that I'm that guy that always lets

6090.179 --> 6095.28
logic get in the way

6092.82 --> 6097.259999999999
and even back then by the way I was also

6095.28 --> 6100.0199999999995
dealing with people that would have like

6097.26 --> 6102.84
these stupid spiritualist slogans like

6100.02 --> 6105.42
oh everybody has their own truth there

6102.84 --> 6107.88
is no truth it's truth is subjective

6105.42 --> 6110.88
like people like that were

6107.88 --> 6112.92
also surrounding it and it was like you

6110.88 --> 6115.38
guys have no idea what you're talking

6112.92 --> 6119.96
about like you literally do not

6115.38 --> 6119.96
understand the words that you're using

6120.0 --> 6122.78
so

6124.619 --> 6129.679
so after that yeah they I kind of lost

6127.32 --> 6129.679
interest

6139.5 --> 6143.76
by the way what I'm now talking about

6141.84 --> 6145.8
that behavior that was not directly

6143.76 --> 6148.38
associated with the documentary makers

6145.8 --> 6151.26
that I mentioned earlier

6148.38 --> 6153.719
so just people that were also in those

6151.26 --> 6156.780000000001
groups that we were coming to man

6153.719 --> 6160.699
together to meet here in Utrecht by the

6156.78 --> 6160.699
way it's really funny I was here

6160.8 --> 6165.4800000000005
still had a car I would drive over here

6163.56 --> 6168.360000000001
and then have those meetings in like an

6165.48 --> 6170.879999999999
old school band building

6168.36 --> 6172.86
one of my conclusions about crop circles

6170.88 --> 6176.179
but I don't really care

6172.86 --> 6176.179
but uh

6178.86 --> 6183.5
I think it is sophisticated art

6183.84 --> 6193.58
and it is definitely man designed

6189.54 --> 6193.58
but really sophisticated though

6198.659 --> 6205.138999999999
it's not just a bunch of guys walking in

6202.32 --> 6207.719
the field and doing that I mean I've

6205.139 --> 6210.42
seen like how apparently like a certain

6207.719 --> 6212.94
it's like a thing that just uses like

6210.42 --> 6214.7390000000005
localized microwave heat to specifically

6212.94 --> 6217.678999999999
like burst

6214.739 --> 6221.299999999999
the plants in a very specific way

6217.679 --> 6221.3
so that it all just like

6221.699 --> 6228.239
like origami paper folding just

6225.119 --> 6230.82
perfectly fits like in every aspect like

6228.239 --> 6234.178999999999
there was no person there to do that

6230.82 --> 6236.099999999999
it's something that's been beamed in

6234.179 --> 6237.78
there to cause that

6236.1 --> 6239.04
that's what I learned from corrupt

6237.78 --> 6243.119
circles

6239.04 --> 6248.78
like that that is absolutely you cannot

6243.119 --> 6248.78
fake that somehow as a hoax

6252.659 --> 6257.82
right but maybe they use some like weird

6255.06 --> 6260.46
and directed energy weapon maybe it's

6257.82 --> 6263.099999999999
that maybe it's Artistry that comes from

6260.46 --> 6265.56
the directed energy weapons

6263.1 --> 6267.719
in an early stage right the energy was

6265.56 --> 6271.5
like a beam thing a freaking helicopter

6267.719 --> 6272.82
beams something and then like cars just

6271.5 --> 6275.52
start melting

6272.82 --> 6279.179
that [ __ ] right well maybe that

6275.52 --> 6282.42
technology is part

6279.179 --> 6284.28
of making crop circles

6282.42 --> 6285.78
have you ever thought about that

6284.28 --> 6287.5199999999995
right

6285.78 --> 6290.88
like what if you not just

6287.52 --> 6292.320000000001
straightforward cook it like vibrate it

6290.88 --> 6295.7390000000005
to death or whatever however that

6292.32 --> 6298.5
exactly works but instead like get a

6295.739 --> 6299.699
very specific layer like at a certain

6298.5 --> 6301.8
distance

6299.699 --> 6303.719
this is an oscillation there is the Heat

6301.8 --> 6305.639
and then the distance not the Heat and

6303.719 --> 6309.179
then another and maybe they could

6305.639 --> 6312.3
literally like almost three three 3D

6309.179 --> 6315.659
print virtually a pattern that they can

6312.3 --> 6318.119000000001
cause with the directed energy weapon

6315.659 --> 6320.23
that they used to make these crop

6318.119 --> 6323.3099999999995
circles as art

6320.23 --> 6323.3099999999995
[Music]

6323.4 --> 6326.299999999999
that's what I think

6328.68 --> 6331.939
[Music]

6333.78 --> 6340.139
right so it's it's a more sophisticated

6337.44 --> 6341.82
directed energy weapon technology that I

6340.139 --> 6345.06
think they used

6341.82 --> 6348.0599999999995
that they applied purely as an art form

6345.06 --> 6351.92
probably to well to impress people and

6348.06 --> 6351.92
to create rumors of aliens

6353.17 --> 6356.359
[Music]

6356.58 --> 6363.0
sent to PayPal what oh hello Nathan

6360.0 --> 6363.0
really

6366.36 --> 6368.28
cool

6366.95 --> 6371.239
[Music]

6368.28 --> 6371.239
appreciated

6373.98 --> 6376.94
thank you very much

6378.45 --> 6383.659
[Music]

6379.98 --> 6383.659
I mean I can definitely use it

6386.88 --> 6391.28
thank you very much

6388.739 --> 6391.28
huh

6392.58 --> 6395.6
hope you're doing well

6406.739 --> 6412.199
right but

6408.84 --> 6413.88
in my mind I can very much make that

6412.199 --> 6416.54
connection

6413.88 --> 6419.82
that crop circles are made through

6416.54 --> 6421.86
directed energy weapon technology

6419.82 --> 6424.86
I mean

6421.86 --> 6428.0
it is the only thing that could do

6424.86 --> 6428.0
something at a distance

6428.94 --> 6434.82
without physically touching it

6432.3 --> 6437.04
but then we would have to conclude that

6434.82 --> 6440.5199999999995
they've actually managed to refine that

6437.04 --> 6443.54
technology to a pretty creepy degree

6440.52 --> 6446.400000000001
like actually really creepy how

6443.54 --> 6448.38
sophisticated they can

6446.4 --> 6450.78
adapt what they're doing with that

6448.38 --> 6452.88
technology then if they can make crop

6450.78 --> 6455.5199999999995
circles out of it

6452.88 --> 6458.04
right not just melt cars

6455.52 --> 6459.84
not just like splatter or something but

6458.04 --> 6462.0
no they can apparently do very

6459.84 --> 6463.02
sophisticated detailed things with it

6462.0 --> 6465.659
then

6463.02 --> 6467.2300000000005
making crop circles with it

6465.659 --> 6470.389999999999
for decades

6467.23 --> 6470.389999999999
[Music]

6480.06 --> 6484.5
right

6481.5 --> 6487.44
and for all we know the way they did it

6484.5 --> 6489.48
is just have a plane fly over pretty

6487.44 --> 6491.46
high altitude that would literally just

6489.48 --> 6492.959999999999
focus beam it

6491.46 --> 6494.88
down

6492.96 --> 6496.679
that is such a fast distance that you

6494.88 --> 6500.719
wouldn't even notice that there is that

6496.679 --> 6500.719
plane there while it happens

6503.4 --> 6506.82
right because planes can fly a lot

6505.26 --> 6509.159000000001
higher than helicopters I mean a

6506.82 --> 6510.96
helicopter would be easier probably but

6509.159 --> 6512.94
you would absolutely notice like oh

6510.96 --> 6518.04
there's a helicopter flying over oh a

6512.94 --> 6518.04
crop circle hmm connection right

6524.58 --> 6530.159
you can find the target they well you

6527.34 --> 6532.92
don't exactly know how what is directing

6530.159 --> 6535.799999999999
that then they can

6532.92 --> 6538.26
is kind of extremely vague it all

6535.8 --> 6540.179
depends on what they're at what they're

6538.26 --> 6543.179
actually going to be doing

6540.179 --> 6544.86
what is the delivery device

6543.179 --> 6547.02
I mean are they gonna have like some

6544.86 --> 6550.04
giant Death Star laser

6547.02 --> 6553.1990000000005
all the way from Antarctica that just

6550.04 --> 6555.3
fires all the way all the way around

6553.199 --> 6558.48
across the world right and then aim on

6555.3 --> 6560.28
the feet accurately uh kind of doubt it

6558.48 --> 6562.678999999999
but yeah if they have a helicopter

6560.28 --> 6564.719
that's floating above yeah I bet they

6562.679 --> 6566.4
can aim it like within

6564.719 --> 6569.42
feet

6566.4 --> 6569.42
very accurately

6588.719 --> 6594.02
pins oh great thanks George thanks a lot

6600.02 --> 6603.9800000000005
that's [ __ ] great dude

6609.01 --> 6612.22
[Music]

6615.239 --> 6619.86
who the [ __ ] even has those patents

6618.06 --> 6622.619000000001
where

6619.86 --> 6625.219
why hasn't it like why is that even

6622.619 --> 6625.219
visible

6625.8 --> 6631.08
why is that why is that Declassified

6628.679 --> 6633.679
Georgetown how the [ __ ] did you even get

6631.08 --> 6633.679
that information

6634.93 --> 6641.3
[Music]

6637.98 --> 6641.299999999999

[Music]

6663.28 --> 6667.92
[Music]

6665.58 --> 6670.44
we need to sniff out DNA from altitude

6667.92 --> 6674.52
no it would just start to resonate to an

6670.44 --> 6676.199
X very extremely specific

6674.52 --> 6679.26
form

6676.199 --> 6681.9
like the gene form

6679.26 --> 6685.02
right it's just resonation like you

6681.9 --> 6688.32
resonate based on the extremely specific

6685.02 --> 6691.26
form on a microscopic level and then

6688.32 --> 6694.139
everything that resonates exactly with

6691.26 --> 6697.320000000001
that form will be affected

6694.139 --> 6700.04
that's how that works

6697.32 --> 6700.04
generally

6700.38 --> 6705.78
seen those where why the [ __ ] did just

6703.739 --> 6708.54
throw that openly

6705.78 --> 6710.699
Who the hell's gonna just make a patent

6708.54 --> 6713.4
like that and just open it to the public

6710.699 --> 6715.799999999999
like oh yeah we can genetically destroy

6713.4 --> 6716.879999999999
people at a distance like what the [ __ ]

6715.8 --> 6720.38
man

6716.88 --> 6720.38
who the hell does that

6726.36 --> 6728.48
thank you

6733.219 --> 6738.6
tool yeah so that makes me think it's

6736.199 --> 6741.78
fake

6738.6 --> 6744.360000000001
it's just like hell hell we're gonna

6741.78 --> 6745.98
destroy you we're all powerful we don't

6744.36 --> 6748.08
you don't know it but we could push a

6745.98 --> 6750.718999999999
button and then you suddenly drop that

6748.08 --> 6752.659
you specifically not because we gave you

6750.719 --> 6755.219
an implant but because we have a device

6752.659 --> 6757.199
across the entire world that can just

6755.219 --> 6759.719
pinpoint you we press a button and you

6757.199 --> 6762.44
die because we say so like what the [ __ ]

6759.719 --> 6767.42
man that's garbage

6762.44 --> 6770.96
absolute horse [ __ ] paranoia seating

6767.42 --> 6770.96
absolute [ __ ]

6791.28 --> 6799.04
like why is this there

6795.3 --> 6803.46
foreign why is this open information

6799.04 --> 6808.44
this should be illegal

6803.46 --> 6808.44

no so impressive some stupid little dude

6883.619 --> 6887.839999999999
you're impressed by that why

yeah

6910.199 --> 6916.86
I mean any dog any dog can at the run

robots or something

6972.96 --> 6976.76
I don't know why they're doing that

6982.86 --> 6986.58
Chinese people are also don't be too

6985.02 --> 6989.040000000001
sure about that I mean yeah they're

6986.58 --> 6991.0199999999995
gonna go through that [ __ ] but

6989.04 --> 6993.659

they're like a third of the world

7010.34 --> 7015.26
you know how many there are they're not

7012.679 --> 7017.42
just lost doesn't matter like if they go

7015.26 --> 7020.4800000000005
through a meat grinder literally on a

freaking medical propaganda how about

7082.46 --> 7086.9
that

7084.679 --> 7090.1990000000005
I'm much more worried about

7086.9 --> 7092.239
like the psychological warfare

7090.199 --> 7095.0
and we've been subjected yeah we're not

7092.239 --> 7097.218999999999
being like locked down and forced into

7095.0 --> 7101.42
all this [ __ ]

7097.219 --> 7105.88
to the level that supposedly China does

7101.42 --> 7105.88
but the results are a lot worse

7111.739 --> 7116.119
there's more damage being done here in

7114.619 --> 7119.0599999999995
Europe

7116.119 --> 7121.58
than in China in my opinion even though

7119.06 --> 7125.320000000001
they are in a [ __ ] up situation but it

7121.58 --> 7125.32
has been like that for decades

7128.78 --> 7134.619
they've already been through like the

7131.84 --> 7134.619000000001
worst of it all

7136.88 --> 7141.56
foreign

7138.219 --> 7142.52
here we still have some individualism

7141.56 --> 7146.0

ideas and culture left from the past but

7146.0 --> 7152.0
they're making a lot of Headway in

7148.099 --> 7157.28
absolutely destroying that forever

7152.0 --> 7160.52
unless we rise up and nip it in the bud

7157.28 --> 7165.82
and then give these main players that

7160.52 --> 7165.820000000001
are rolling this out the death penalty

7168.92 --> 7174.02

that's the only thing we can do if you

7174.02 --> 7177.26
don't

7174.92 --> 7180.08
it's over

7183.38 --> 7188.7390000000005

can't let them distract you but you

7197.96 --> 7202.28
cannot allow them to get away and be

7200.0 --> 7205.34
forgiven either

that's the predicament we're in

there's only one way to end it and that

7207.38 --> 7211.4800000000005

7208.46 --> 7211.4800000000005

they won't speak to you about TV yeah

you don't know it but like the medical

7285.139 --> 7287.8
Inquisition

corrupted and Rogue

7293.179 --> 7299.659
genocidal

they're all going to be in big big

probably gonna die because of that

7355.58 --> 7360.92

something right no no they're not gonna

7437.239 --> 7441.86

7439.639 --> 7443.3
you guys wanted to talk about the other

7441.86 --> 7446.5599999999995
stuff

7443.3 --> 7446.56
lots of other stuff

7446.679 --> 7451.3
Chemtrails some history of that

7452.02 --> 7458.42
my insights on how it yeah well that's

7456.5 --> 7460.78
gonna repeat it all

7458.42 --> 7460.78
uh

7462.44 --> 7467.598999999999
reincarnation

7465.139 --> 7472.52
yeah reincarnation yeah

7467.599 --> 7475.52
it's based on the howdy machowski

7472.52 --> 7478.099
train of thinking which is like a yeah

7475.52 --> 7481.219
well that is like old stuff

7478.099 --> 7483.92
it's all priesthood understanding it's

7481.219 --> 7486.139
also Egyptian you could say but there's

7483.92 --> 7490.28
something to it there it's basically a

7486.139 --> 7492.08
cosmology it's a spirit cosmology thing

7490.28 --> 7495.259999999999
that's what it's about

7492.08 --> 7498.199
and the idea is that you do

7495.26 --> 7503.06
basically you're stuck to this realm

7498.199 --> 7506.199
until you no longer reincarnate

7503.06 --> 7506.1990000000005
until you're done

7509.239 --> 7514.459999999999
and then you can escape to whatever that

7512.179 --> 7517.219
leads to

7514.46 --> 7519.139
out of the Incarnation that is how the

7517.219 --> 7523.2390000000005
machowski's philosophy basically that's

7519.139 --> 7524.900000000001
what he reasons about a lot

7523.239 --> 7527.0599999999995
discusses

7524.9 --> 7529.46
but yeah then there is this thing like

7527.06 --> 7532.580000000001
Okay so

7529.46 --> 7534.5
arguably sin is the thing that keeps you

7532.58 --> 7536.3
here keeps you reincarnating because you

7534.5 --> 7539.54
don't you're facing sin and then you

7536.3 --> 7542.360000000001
don't overcome it then you don't grow

7539.54 --> 7543.98
don't develop the spirit further

7542.36 --> 7547.0
but then

7543.98 --> 7550.159
to make other sin like a

7547.0 --> 7552.86
religious thing to do that to make

7550.159 --> 7557.92
others sin would effectively to be

7552.86 --> 7560.36
halting their Spiritual Development and

7557.92 --> 7561.9800000000005
potentially forcing them if the sin is

7560.36 --> 7564.86
bad enough to

7561.98 --> 7566.598999999999
no longer have a chance to escape but to

7564.86 --> 7568.94
be bound to your sin and then

7566.599 --> 7571.82
reincarnate and try over again

7568.94 --> 7575.78
so the question for me was then

7571.82 --> 7576.98
why would they do that why would you

7575.78 --> 7578.86
keep

7576.98 --> 7581.718999999999
spirits

7578.86 --> 7585.4
reincarnating by making them commit sin

7581.719 --> 7585.4
what is the point to that

7585.98 --> 7589.839999999999
it's kind of a complicated question

7590.659 --> 7595.098999999999
don't know nothing about that so you do

7593.42 --> 7597.7390000000005
know something about if you don't know

7595.099 --> 7600.9800000000005
nothing about it

7597.739 --> 7603.739
then do you know something about it no

7600.98 --> 7606.5
just I know what you mean uh right but

7603.739 --> 7607.879999999999
I'm not yeah that's it I mean we could

7606.5 --> 7610.28
talk about it some other time when

7607.88 --> 7612.32
everybody's in the mood for this

7610.28 --> 7614.0599999999995
or maybe I'll just stick to howdy

7612.32 --> 7616.96
machowski's comments where everybody's

7614.06 --> 7620.4800000000005
all filled up with this kind of idea

7616.96 --> 7623.7390000000005
And discussing endlessly have you ever

7620.48 --> 7623.739
seen his comment section

7625.699 --> 7630.699
I mean that's a pretty incredible

7627.86 --> 7630.699
comment section

7632.78 --> 7637.179
I wish I had some commenters like that

7639.739 --> 7645.739
I don't know why not I mean am I that

7642.56 --> 7648.139
pointless am I not inspirational enough

7645.739 --> 7650.299999999999
do I disrupt your Trader thinking am I

7648.139 --> 7652.219
not specific enough for you to be able

7650.3 --> 7654.5
to do that

7652.219 --> 7656.9
am I too all over the place for people

7654.5 --> 7659.0
like that to actually stick to me and

7656.9 --> 7660.739
get inspired and start commenting I

7659.0 --> 7662.599
don't understand I don't understand why

7660.739 --> 7665.36
they get that

7662.599 --> 7667.58
and I don't although I do got you guys

7665.36 --> 7668.96
and you guys are cool

7667.58 --> 7671.739
but

7668.96 --> 7671.7390000000005
it's different

7675.92 --> 7682.599
sure but anyway I we could talk about

7678.98 --> 7682.598999999999
this some other time I guess

7687.639 --> 7691.36
what what are you talking about
