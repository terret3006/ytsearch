are not in front of the Sun it's

89.3 --> 96.979
actually nice and warm now it's a little

91.07 --> 101.96
fresh also I've been noticing that some

96.979 --> 104.119
trees with the pink blossoms are opening

up here and there although not the ones

Parker right I think I got everyone

170.77 --> 183.96
unbelievable productions yeah I'm good

174.19 --> 188.29
see you all so a late night yesterday

183.96 --> 191.74
been very active yesterday I was on

188.29 --> 194.31
Jose's and I actually dropped by Jose's

191.74 --> 197.20000000000002
I thought like yeah let's try that again

194.31 --> 205.81
see what happens and it was interesting

197.2 --> 207.64
I don't know if anybody noticed but yeah

205.81 --> 213.79
I went down there like at the beginning

207.64 --> 215.44
of a show and went up against you have

213.79 --> 219.76
some typical ballers that are in there

215.44 --> 222.57
and it was funny because they yeah they

219.76 --> 226.45
were looking over what is it

222.57 --> 229.26999999999998
footage overlooking water and they did a

226.45 --> 231.51999999999998
a light feasibility test or somebody did

229.27 --> 234.19
at least and there were these oddities

231.52 --> 236.56
about it and it was kind of interesting

234.19 --> 238.84
but yeah one thing that I definitely did

236.56 --> 242.95
did take notice off oh by the way 101

238.84 --> 245.77
horror account is here too though that

242.95 --> 247.86999999999998
yeah they never actually at any point

245.77 --> 253.12
claimed that it had anything to do with

247.87 --> 258.07
curvature they kind of was it they

253.12 --> 259.959
defaulted on that they disclaim that and

258.07 --> 262.12
I thought I was particularly funny so

259.959 --> 266.65
they were just looking over like optics

262.12 --> 270.22
optics but yeah most they didn't claim

266.65 --> 274.47999999999996
it was a curve basically or at least not

270.22 --> 277.0
a geometrical curve or not a geometrical

274.48 --> 277.48
horizon in any way so that was kind of

277.0 --> 279.82
funny

277.48 --> 281.8
until then Brenda came in and basically

279.82 --> 284.62
did the brand nothing and then

281.8 --> 287.01
completely went full in doublespeak and

284.62 --> 290.0
just say no it is a girl is that dirty

287.01 --> 292.25
it was then yet

290.0 --> 294.26
the conversation just turned into

292.25 --> 298.16
complete malarkey after that point I

294.26 --> 299.99
didn't get back in after a while after I

298.16 --> 302.44
kind of settled that yeah there wasn't

299.99 --> 304.88
not going to be any more actual

302.44 --> 308.5
productive conversation after that point

304.88 --> 310.34
but I still joined again anyway and just

308.5 --> 319.19
screw it around a little

310.34 --> 323.0
I did get Kiwi to actually watch it it's

319.19 --> 326.39
funny when I put out something in like

323.0 --> 334.46
ballbuster shadow in Skype he does

326.39 --> 338.89
actually look at it but of course he had

334.46 --> 342.62
some criticism about me falling for I

338.89 --> 344.51
have a question the I have a question

342.62 --> 346.16
attack red herring tactic pretty much

344.51 --> 348.11
it's like okay let's bend off the

346.16 --> 350.99
conversation and I won anyway and then

348.11 --> 352.82
oh let's ask you a question and then

350.99 --> 354.92
they went in about science and the

352.82 --> 357.40999999999997
scientific method I yeah I did my best

354.92 --> 361.43
to defend that but they eventually like

357.41 --> 364.13000000000005
let me around the garden Lille and yeah

361.43 --> 366.74
you know there's only so far you can

364.13 --> 369.62
actually go with these ballers before

366.74 --> 371.24
they just muddy the water so bad that

369.62 --> 377.12
there's just nothing you can do at a

371.24 --> 379.64
certain point but it was still fun to be

377.12 --> 382.07
in there with the ballers I kind of I

379.64 --> 384.44
think I said that I would unblock Brenda

382.07 --> 387.23
but as the conversation went on I

384.44 --> 391.66
realized that I'm definitely not gonna

387.23 --> 391.66
unblock Brenda just

396.62 --> 404.24
I'm just having severe doubts at this

399.9 --> 407.63899999999995
point that that I can actually and

404.24 --> 412.349
spirit wise even classify as human it

407.639 --> 417.419
I'm at this point it's just it's like

412.349 --> 420.06
she compartmentalize this this view of

417.419 --> 421.919
how it is to be human and that's what

420.06 --> 424.34
she shows but when it actually comes

421.919 --> 428.25
down to it there's really nothing

424.34 --> 431.63899999999995
nothing sensible human or earthly but

428.25 --> 435.449
anything she does it's complete lunatic

431.639 --> 438.539
like a real complete lunatic that just

435.449 --> 440.24
says no like philosophy is physical it's

438.539 --> 441.59
just like the most contradictory

440.24 --> 445.289
nonsense

441.59 --> 448.65
malarkey ever it's like it's gone worse

445.289 --> 454.789
with random if there's if yeah if you

448.65 --> 463.59
can even imagine such a thing all right

454.789 --> 470.19
anyway so that happened and oh yeah I

463.59 --> 472.469
went over to Roxanne's as well in chat

470.19 --> 476.009
sometimes a fun place to hang around and

472.469 --> 479.07
a meeting was in there and ya know she

476.009 --> 483.96000000000004
does a show now almost daily I think

479.07 --> 488.55
it's pretty amusing at times yeah Tom

483.96 --> 490.919
Parker's it's just I'm not even gonna go

488.55 --> 493.86
over all the ridiculous claims that she

490.919 --> 495.81
makes and persists making it's like she

493.86 --> 498.41900000000004
makes the most ridiculous science fight

495.81 --> 501.0
we had philosophical claims and then

498.419 --> 503.34
sticks to that actually keeps on

501.0 --> 507.83
doubling down on every ridiculous thing

503.34 --> 511.13
she said pretty much it's she is

507.83 --> 511.13
mentally insane

511.21 --> 529.899
for real it's not an act so yeah what do

525.74 --> 529.899
you guys the girls have been up to oh

531.16 --> 540.279
yeah also been watching a couple of

533.779 --> 544.66
movies that I downloaded they were

540.279 --> 544.66
interesting and somewhat intense

550.59 --> 556.38
I went I watched three movies actually

553.29 --> 558.48
although the other one was the day

556.38 --> 560.79
before it wasn't yesterday I forgot to

558.48 --> 563.73
mention it and watch like the second

560.79 --> 565.79
Jumanji Phil thought it was very

563.73 --> 574.35
entertaining

565.79 --> 576.5699999999999
yesterday I work watch two movies Dark

574.35 --> 580.94
Phoenix and the Avengers endgame I

576.57 --> 583.2900000000001
hadn't seen either of them and I thought

580.94 --> 588.96
well yeah they were kind of what I

583.29 --> 591.54
expected them to be well I didn't really

588.96 --> 594.39
know what to expect with Dark Phoenix it

591.54 --> 599.5999999999999
was kind of like a another did that

594.39 --> 604.71
universes version of what is it x-men 3

599.6 --> 606.5400000000001
was it which was a pretty interesting

604.71 --> 609.0300000000001
movie by the way I thought and weaved

606.54 --> 611.8199999999999
the joke or not and all that but yeah

609.03 --> 616.89
this was very different it was like a

611.82 --> 618.99
completely different angle to it they

616.89 --> 623.37
inserted a couple of astronauts and all

618.99 --> 625.5600000000001
that yeah I don't know it wasn't there

623.37 --> 627.99
were some issues with it especially

625.56 --> 631.1099999999999
atmosphere was like the atmosphere was

627.99 --> 636.12
just kind of odd at times and I didn't

631.11 --> 638.07
like how everybody acted although it

636.12 --> 640.47
might have been partially the script I

638.07 --> 642.36
don't know the Dark Phoenix had some

640.47 --> 645.12
weird things to it

642.36 --> 647.91
I might have to watch it again with

645.12 --> 652.29
another perspective just to get that

647.91 --> 655.5899999999999
cleared up but yeah ventured endgame was

652.29 --> 658.7099999999999
yeah exactly what you'd expect it was it

655.59 --> 660.9
was pretty good it was like a bit yeah

658.71 --> 662.97
cartoonish at times but yeah what'd you

660.9 --> 668.06
expect you know especially with such a

662.97 --> 668.0600000000001
huge lineup movie

668.93 --> 679.6999999999999
anyway I watched those took quite and

672.78 --> 679.6999999999999
could took a few hours it was good

696.14 --> 704.18
or am i able to make the show Friday Tom

699.59 --> 707.24
Parker well yeah I think so there should

704.18 --> 711.05
be no obstacles there except for me

707.24 --> 715.0600000000001
maybe going to bed too late yes I'll try

711.05 --> 715.06
not to go too late tomorrow

734.55 --> 741.66
George Sanford you got snow - what what

737.67 --> 745.92
we're said like in the the northern part

741.66 --> 748.709
of America or something I don't know

745.92 --> 750.779
well where's this snow I heard from John

748.709 --> 757.41
opt-out yesterday that there was snow

750.779 --> 759.45
but can I talk about light well sure I

757.41 --> 764.31
can talk about light I talk about light

759.45 --> 766.6800000000001
all the time although yeah the problem

764.31 --> 770.0699999999999
is the most that I have to talk about

766.68 --> 773.0699999999999
concerning light is that I just see that

770.07 --> 776.339
there are issues with it that are being

773.07 --> 778.2900000000001
overlooked and like options that are

776.339 --> 780.2090000000001
being overlooked and not explored and

778.29 --> 783.75
people getting caught up in false

780.209 --> 786.42
dichotomies and that's like the standard

783.75 --> 788.91
process that's been laying there for

786.42 --> 793.29
everybody to dig in to in the last 80 to

788.91 --> 800.9399999999999
100 years no light is not instantaneous

793.29 --> 803.1899999999999
it is not it has a speed empiric you can

800.94 --> 806.0400000000001
empirically deduce this it's very easy

803.19 --> 809.19
to do that so while it's not super easy

806.04 --> 811.77
but it is doable is on the level of

809.19 --> 815.6600000000001
doable as figuring out light has

811.77 --> 815.66
diffraction cascade with a double slit

820.19 --> 835.2
save it for Friday sure or whatever it's

832.02 --> 837.74
just there's more to explore concerning

835.2 --> 842.1600000000001
the nature of light in my personal view

837.74 --> 844.83
but yeah I feel I've already pretty much

842.16 --> 847.29
come to the limits of where you can go

844.83 --> 851.1600000000001
just conceptually reasoning out without

847.29 --> 853.77
checking certain details you know if you

851.16 --> 856.4699999999999
don't anchor the ideas in empiricism at

853.77 --> 859.05
some point the options are going to be

856.47 --> 862.94
so chaotically widespread there's just

859.05 --> 862.9399999999999
no way to make any sense of it anymore

873.56 --> 876.63
[Music]

883.94 --> 892.61
shout retracted for a Jose flippy

888.77 --> 894.56
flopper Gonzalez okay thanks and

892.61 --> 898.3000000000001
lievable productions for the two dollars

894.56 --> 898.3
which a donation much appreciated

924.34 --> 933.25
right um anyway uh I went through all

930.17 --> 933.25
that pretty quickly I think

992.49 --> 1002.39
oh right yeah I know oh did I forget to

996.18 --> 1007.28
say sorry about being late a little yeah

1002.39 --> 1009.17
I I did get up a little late not super

1007.28 --> 1011.4499999999999
late but then I went to get some

1009.17 --> 1014.75
groceries quit as quick as possible

1011.45 --> 1019.22
and got a smoke and then yeah I know

1014.75 --> 1020.11
just took seven minutes roughly longer

1019.22 --> 1025.31
than I thought

1020.11 --> 1027.8600000000001
but I was also having some nerve issues

1025.31 --> 1030.49
that's like they have this weird

1027.86 --> 1036.26
shouting men shouting matches with my

1030.49 --> 1039.73
subconscious again that just it's such

1036.26 --> 1042.01
an odd thing to have those experiences

1039.73 --> 1048.47
[Music]

1042.01 --> 1055.09
it's like it's I can't even explain that

1048.47 --> 1057.65
like yeah punished on the show like that

1055.09 --> 1059.05
no not all the coffee shops are closed

1057.65 --> 1062.18
No

1059.05 --> 1062.18
[Music]

1078.22 --> 1084.3600000000001
watch the slow-mo are you talking about

1081.789 --> 1084.36
James Mason

1095.51 --> 1100.97
why do people get their smoke from from

1098.09 --> 1107.6
coffee shops and tobacco shops they're

1100.97 --> 1109.6100000000001
still open at least over here I don't

1107.6 --> 1112.1
know you know about other countries have

1109.61 --> 1114.3799999999999
seen some disturbing for sport reports

1112.1 --> 1118.1299999999999
you could say in England and in

1114.38 --> 1121.67
Australia where the police is just just

1118.13 --> 1125.66
being super super autocratic

1121.67 --> 1127.16
autocratic like just pushing people like

1125.66 --> 1129.26
out of parties and everything like

1127.16 --> 1131.9
literally just barging and telling

1129.26 --> 1134.66
people they can have barbecues like what

1131.9 --> 1138.49
you're gonna tell an Australian not to

1134.66 --> 1138.49
have barbecues are you out of your mind

1138.82 --> 1144.8
but yeah they're doing it at least from

1143.27 --> 1146.15
those two countries that I've seen I

1144.8 --> 1147.95
don't know it could be more places I

1146.15 --> 1151.45
don't know in the Netherlands it doesn't

1147.95 --> 1151.45
seem to be that strict like that

1162.71 --> 1169.46
yeah I've seen plenty of like groups

1166.33 --> 1171.71
friends you could say that would like

1169.46 --> 1174.68
yesterday they were just they took a

1171.71 --> 1180.01
table put it there and just had a picnic

1174.68 --> 1184.9
with five you know so well it's not

1180.01 --> 1184.9
they're not pushing it that bad here

1191.06 --> 1196.3999999999999
George Sanford okay I shut down the

1193.76 --> 1201.17
coffee shop that sucks man that's pretty

1196.4 --> 1203.24
harsh sale for umbrella what are you

1201.17 --> 1206.3300000000002
talking about yeah

1203.24 --> 1209.24
fire fire what is fire what is okay so

1206.33 --> 1211.87
you're gonna now explain that or you're

1209.24 --> 1211.8700000000001
gonna get a timeout

1223.71 --> 1227.8400000000001
it's just what are you doing

1257.31 --> 1262.3799999999999
well I am NOT talking it did I even

1260.58 --> 1267.09
mention the word I just said that there

1262.38 --> 1270.0900000000001
is a lot of police crackdown um things

1267.09 --> 1272.4299999999998
like barbecues and that that there's

1270.09 --> 1274.11
this disruption going on in specific

1272.43 --> 1276.39
countries that I've taken note of and

1274.11 --> 1278.07
then I hadn't noticed it in my country I

1276.39 --> 1280.47
thought it was worth mentioning you know

1278.07 --> 1282.99
it's kind of being updated with the

1280.47 --> 1286.07
daily situation one of the purposes of

1282.99 --> 1290.34
this show as well besides talking

1286.07 --> 1292.55
cosmogony and spirits stuff and and all

1290.34 --> 1292.55
that

1296.94 --> 1302.93
this is purely about like yeah

1299.04 --> 1306.87
government policies and autocratic moves

1302.93 --> 1307.26
by the world government which is what it

1306.87 --> 1309.6899999999998
is

1307.26 --> 1312.96
that's how its uniform like that because

1309.69 --> 1315.66
it is a world government like that yeah

1312.96 --> 1317.94
every group has his own place you know

1315.66 --> 1321.2900000000002
but it is because it's uniform otherwise

1317.94 --> 1321.29
none of this would happen

1327.12 --> 1331.6799999999998
now that doesn't mean that it's all a

1329.1 --> 1334.23
giant monolithic one single minded

1331.68 --> 1336.03
system however you know that's said that

1334.23 --> 1338.85
from the start it's always been just

1336.03 --> 1342.81
groups conspiring but also practically

1338.85 --> 1345.6299999999999
being enemies it was has always been

1342.81 --> 1349.77
it's on every level on every level it

1345.63 --> 1353.7
works like that almost every level and

1349.77 --> 1358.04
kind of always has been at least during

1353.7 --> 1362.1200000000001
my lifetime it's just getting more

1358.04 --> 1362.12
condensed now it's just getting more

1362.27 --> 1368.03
more compartmentalized yeah it's just

1365.67 --> 1368.03
what it is

1381.04 --> 1385.81
right Robin Stanley I think our library

1384.01 --> 1388.39
here is also closed there is a library

1385.81 --> 1390.75
not that I typically go there but it is

1388.39 --> 1390.75
closed

1402.34 --> 1406.3999999999999
stockpiles of wheat I doubt it

1404.75 --> 1407.9
you think they're just gonna let it sit

1406.4 --> 1409.3000000000002
there no they're just gonna give it to

1407.9 --> 1415.3300000000002
Street dealers

1409.3 --> 1415.33
I'll give it sell it no

1432.62 --> 1435.2199999999998
right

1446.1 --> 1451.32
stocked up cheese all right

1452.67 --> 1460.5900000000001
well Paul fuuny Phoenix for me I don't

1458.5 --> 1460.59
know

1463.96 --> 1468.22
like I'm not gonna stock up like that

1466.36 --> 1470.08
because well first off I don't really

1468.22 --> 1475.15
have that kind of money available to

1470.08 --> 1477.85
even do that because probably start

1475.15 --> 1480.46
smoking too much of it it's it's very

1477.85 --> 1483.79
tough to just sit on the giant pile like

1480.46 --> 1486.3700000000001
that at this moment you know but if I

1483.79 --> 1488.83
had when I quit i sat on the giant back

1486.37 --> 1492.4299999999998
for years that didn't mean anything

1488.83 --> 1494.23
because I quit when I'm not quitting

1492.43 --> 1496.66
it's very tough to sit on a big pack

1494.23 --> 1499.54
like that which I don't have the money

1496.66 --> 1503.26
for and so if the coffee shops would

1499.54 --> 1505.42
close over here then I'd either go on to

1503.26 --> 1507.9
street dealing or I'd literally deal

1505.42 --> 1513.13
with it and just tell myself finally

1507.9 --> 1517.48
there's no more way out for me I must

1513.13 --> 1520.92
stop it again it's like because stopping

1517.48 --> 1523.42
is so difficult for me and it's like I I

1520.92 --> 1529.99
really don't want it for multiple

1523.42 --> 1533.02
reasons that yeah if I was just unable

1529.99 --> 1536.47
to I just quit like that and just use

1533.02 --> 1540.91
the excuse in whatever approach to just

1536.47 --> 1546.01
stop it again because yeah I kind of

1540.91 --> 1548.5600000000002
like to move beyond or the financial

1546.01 --> 1553.81
obstacle that it does pose to me because

1548.56 --> 1557.37
it does it is expensive it's the

1553.81 --> 1557.37
Netherlands that doesn't make it cheaper

1563.76 --> 1571.56
well politics for me Phoenix for me it's

1567.84 --> 1573.09
more the psychological obstacles are

1571.56 --> 1577.73
much more difficult than any

1573.09 --> 1577.73
physiological effect it may give me

1588.13 --> 1593.89
easier to quit cannabis and tobacco

1590.46 --> 1596.76
probably oh yeah quitting tobacco's is

1593.89 --> 1599.0800000000002
probably gonna have some side effects

1596.76 --> 1602.32
but yeah that's probably what would

1599.08 --> 1605.53
happen is that I just stopped smoking

1602.32 --> 1608.289
cannabis then and then just smoked like

1605.53 --> 1611.9189999999999
a few cigarettes kinda to wean off it

1608.289 --> 1614.95
slowly then get the physiological issues

1611.919 --> 1617.44
with that once again although look every

1614.95 --> 1620.2
time you know it it depends so greatly

1617.44 --> 1624.94
on just the situation that I'm at while

1620.2 --> 1629.89
I do it if I have a lot of things to do

1624.94 --> 1632.23
an energy to spend like I'm now why I

1629.89 --> 1634.9
will have the energy to spend definitely

1632.23 --> 1638.559
I don't have energy depressions usually

1634.9 --> 1640.96
like my depression usually comes into

1638.559 --> 1643.48
being because I have too much energy and

1640.96 --> 1646.51
it starts to damage me because I can't

1643.48 --> 1650.6200000000001
get rid of it so if I'd be in the middle

1646.51 --> 1653.47
of something like work that required

1650.62 --> 1654.37
like a lot of energy and it's very

1653.47 --> 1657.429
satisfying

1654.37 --> 1660.6999999999998
then quitting tobacco even would

1657.429 --> 1663.4
probably be relatively easy it would be

1660.7 --> 1665.799
relatively easy to do when I quit

1663.4 --> 1668.409
smoking at the time it was kind of easy

1665.799 --> 1670.059
to do because it was in the middle of

1668.409 --> 1672.0700000000002
period where I was kind of crushing it I

1670.059 --> 1675.0
had plenty of money and it was like

1672.07 --> 1679.6589999999999
socially trying to explore things

1675.0 --> 1681.25
testing my style yeah experimenting a

1679.659 --> 1685.6000000000001
lot with Goldsmith thing so I had so

1681.25 --> 1689.02
much to do it just didn't matter as much

1685.6 --> 1691.83
it wouldn't be punishing me as much good

1689.02 --> 1691.83
the quitting

1696.85 --> 1702.4289999999999
all right well that's exactly kind of

1699.49 --> 1705.97
what I described in my in yeah but what

1702.429 --> 1707.799
you're saying there you get all kinds of

1705.97 --> 1709.21
energy back and then yeah why do you do

1707.799 --> 1711.1589999999999
with the freakin energy if there's

1709.21 --> 1713.83
nothing to do with it it's gonna be a

1711.159 --> 1717.759
curse well I'm already partially in that

1713.83 --> 1721.0
kind of state because I do have like too

1717.759 --> 1723.3700000000001
much energy and it's a little difficult

1721.0 --> 1728.649
sometimes to figure out like how to find

1723.37 --> 1730.9289999999999
a durable thing for it that would serve

1728.649 --> 1733.5
a purpose other than to just get rid of

1730.929 --> 1733.5
the energy

1746.24 --> 1754.52
ya know but that just sucks exercise

1750.92 --> 1755.51
mostly just sucks for me I already

1754.52 --> 1757.37
exercise

1755.51 --> 1763.1
I already frickin exercise with pretty

1757.37 --> 1765.4099999999999
much anything I knew if I get walk it's

1763.1 --> 1767.84
probably gonna turn into an exercise if

1765.41 --> 1770.6000000000001
I go grocery shopping it's gonna turn

1767.84 --> 1772.6999999999998
into a night it's just I don't do things

1770.6 --> 1780.3799999999999
without it anyway I forced it in there

1772.7 --> 1781.88
to keep myself healthy it's not really

1780.38 --> 1786.65
about that it's much more about being

1781.88 --> 1793.8500000000001
able to mentally work on something like

1786.65 --> 1795.5300000000002
a huge project yeah yeah in a way yeah

1793.85 --> 1799.52
that's that's that's funny now that you

1795.53 --> 1803.24
mention it when I quit smoking tobacco

1799.52 --> 1806.72
that was around the time when I was

1803.24 --> 1812.45
building even riding my trolls and

1806.72 --> 1813.56
tyrants book my D&D 3.87 version that

1812.45 --> 1817.97
spanned up

1813.56 --> 1822.2
well like four to eight hours a day of

1817.97 --> 1827.08
focus like mental mental puzzling mental

1822.2 --> 1830.42
it was like it's not like programming

1827.08 --> 1832.61
it's almost it's hard to explain it's

1830.42 --> 1835.49
it's sort of like it's it's coding in a

1832.61 --> 1838.6999999999998
way but it's more like legal coding in a

1835.49 --> 1840.86
technical game sense I don't know just

1838.7 --> 1843.05
thinking about the mechanics constantly

1840.86 --> 1845.09
constantly the giant giant bloom

1843.05 --> 1847.28
framework of the mechanics and how it's

1845.09 --> 1848.9599999999998
supposed to be balanced and whatever I'm

1847.28 --> 1852.53
gonna do how is that gonna change the

1848.96 --> 1858.08
belts it's like a mega mega three 4d

1852.53 --> 1862.19
puzzle and that took a lot of focus and

1858.08 --> 1865.22
energy and that made not smoking tobacco

1862.19 --> 1868.55
no problem whatsoever did I get nervous

1865.22 --> 1870.08
or something get the jitters maybe I dig

1868.55 --> 1876.83
into that and it's be like yeah yeah

1870.08 --> 1878.6299999999999
because it required a lot of energy and

1876.83 --> 1879.82
there's a lot to jump around it it's

1878.63 --> 1881.8300000000002
also like even if

1879.82 --> 1884.8
wasn't building I could just be looking

1881.83 --> 1887.5
around forever like all this class that

1884.8 --> 1890.74
class oh this scalability or that spell

1887.5 --> 1892.03
these feats mama moo moo moo moo

1890.74 --> 1894.73
moo-moo-moo-moo back and forth like a

1892.03 --> 1898.96
forth to whatever there would always be

1894.73 --> 1902.32
something so that's kind of how I

1898.96 --> 1909.3
stopped smoking the first time and that

1902.32 --> 1909.3
was when I was thirty that's right

1911.78 --> 1920.57
yeah was around when I was thirty wasn't

1916.82 --> 1924.02
before no it was yeah right because

1920.57 --> 1927.6799999999998
that's when I met my ex so the timing

1924.02 --> 1931.27
was already there because she hated

1927.68 --> 1931.27
tobacco smoking a lot

1936.95 --> 1941.44
hey James Mason yeah yeah you're welcome

1942.37 --> 1950.539
you know I talk more about Flat Earth

1946.09 --> 1957.08
but yeah usually I save it up for the

1950.539 --> 1960.559
Flat Earth debates there's no real

1957.08 --> 1963.35
baller challenges anymore anyway it's

1960.559 --> 1965.0
just just gamma poking these it's like

1963.35 --> 1967.9089999999999
seriously when's the last time you've

1965.0 --> 1971.99
ever seen any serious type of inquiry

1967.909 --> 1976.0700000000002
attempt from a baller it's like that's

1971.99 --> 1981.95
that's a sometime ago because it doesn't

1976.07 --> 1986.62
really work anymore like even even the

1981.95 --> 1990.1390000000001
basic machinations and the the method

1986.62 --> 1995.0
they use for their mental gymnastics are

1990.139 --> 1996.11
now so familiar to me and to the Flat

1995.0 --> 1997.7
Earth debaters and a lot of

1996.11 --> 2002.59
flat-earthers that have been following

1997.7 --> 2005.95
it and people in general that like even

2002.59 --> 2008.4089999999999
their dream as they use it to try to

2005.95 --> 2010.57
forward their religion it's broken

2008.409 --> 2012.3990000000001
like the dream itself is a kind of

2010.57 --> 2015.039
disintegrating as they tried and they

2012.399 --> 2019.149
can feel it that there is really they

2015.039 --> 2022.929
can't the dream just can't move there

2019.149 --> 2025.6589999999999
anymore they can't expand it that far

2022.929 --> 2028.3300000000002
they can apply it that much anymore so

2025.659 --> 2030.19
then it's just gamma poking it's just

2028.33 --> 2036.22
whining and trying to demoralize trying

2030.19 --> 2040.1100000000001
to take down that energy field that is

2036.22 --> 2044.74
metaphorically stopping their dream from

2040.11 --> 2047.1689999999999
penetrating through and the only way

2044.74 --> 2051.22
they do know how to do it is by absolute

2047.169 --> 2057.25
demoralization so that is then what they

2051.22 --> 2059.7099999999996
naturally are inclined to do and that's

2057.25 --> 2062.319
what we see but we now recognize it they

2059.71 --> 2064.379
always used to do that but now they do

2062.319 --> 2068.619
it with more spite and more regret

2064.379 --> 2070.8199999999997
because we can see it much better now

2068.619 --> 2081.58
and we can figure out exactly what there

2070.82 --> 2081.5800000000004
why what it is like to be a baller we do

2084.94 --> 2089.589
and at that that there are plenty of

2087.369 --> 2092.3790000000004
ballers now out there that have kept on

2089.589 --> 2094.45
this baller train on YouTube for a long

2092.379 --> 2096.339
time that our kind of probably wondering

2094.45 --> 2098.2889999999998
like what it must be like to be a flat

2096.339 --> 2101.02
earther because I don't think they can

2098.289 --> 2103.2700000000004
really see it they can see our traits

2101.02 --> 2105.94
they can see our characteristics in the

2103.27 --> 2109.39
communication they can sort of size it

2105.94 --> 2111.67
up but it's like they can take the

2109.39 --> 2115.839
pieces of the puzzle and complete a

2111.67 --> 2118.299
circle with it but they can't see the

2115.839 --> 2120.97
deeper dimensional relation they can't

2118.299 --> 2123.609
understand the real fullness of the

2120.97 --> 2128.23
character in the energy balance because

2123.609 --> 2131.3489999999997
that would require them to to really do

2128.23 --> 2132.73
snap out of their ball or religious few

2131.349 --> 2135.6090000000004
and they can't do that

2132.73 --> 2139.63
so they can only size us up by our

2135.609 --> 2142.24
characteristics they can't really figure

2139.63 --> 2146.6800000000003
it out they can't really understand

2142.24 --> 2149.9199999999996
their mindset like we can read them at

2146.68 --> 2153.3689999999997
that we have an unequal advantage over

2149.92 --> 2157.69
them it's obvious that it's there it

2153.369 --> 2159.609
should be there because we don't go with

2157.69 --> 2163.75
illusions we don't go with spells we

2159.609 --> 2167.22
don't go with religion we we try to go

2163.75 --> 2174.309
about with empiricism and honesty about

2167.22 --> 2177.1899999999996
conceptualization and all that because

2174.309 --> 2180.2200000000003
we can be honest it's actually critical

2177.19 --> 2187.89
that we are honest we don't need to

2180.22 --> 2192.0
shove honesty or truth aside in any form

2187.89 --> 2197.14
just to uphold a very specific

2192.0 --> 2201.88
discipline a way of thinking a vision we

2197.14 --> 2204.21
don't have that we don't need that we

2201.88 --> 2207.4500000000003
just found ourselves in empirical

2204.21 --> 2207.45
natural data

2209.549 --> 2213.7
yeah I know flatlander yeah sorry about

2213.25 --> 2217.869
that

2213.7 --> 2220.21
but it's just that that when I left that

2217.869 --> 2223.869
first time it's just because that was

2220.21 --> 2226.93
not what I got in there for you know

2223.869 --> 2230.5
when Brenda started to get in and all

2226.93 --> 2234.64
that it's just she was just she was in a

2230.5 --> 2238.51
pretty nasty mood to the lot of spite in

2234.64 --> 2245.859
her voice and I just I didn't want to be

2238.51 --> 2248.8590000000004
part of that but then eventually I

2245.859 --> 2250.9
settled that yeah it there was not going

2248.859 --> 2253.21
to be a conversation like what it was

2250.9 --> 2257.88
before and then I just got back there

2253.21 --> 2265.21
for just more goofing around I guess

2257.88 --> 2266.559
sorry pair stop it doesn't matter I'm

2265.21 --> 2268.619
much more concerned with her

2266.559 --> 2270.579
psychological makeup than her

2268.619 --> 2272.789
physiological makeup if you know what I

2270.579 --> 2272.789
mean

2281.33 --> 2288.14
right never sleep by the way thank you

2283.43 --> 2291.44
for the I appreciate that you that you

2288.14 --> 2295.97
liked it I thought I had a pretty a few

2291.44 --> 2298.7000000000003
good moments in the start before before

2295.97 --> 2300.7099999999996
Brenda got in a ruining well didn't

2298.7 --> 2302.75
really ruin it just ruined that the

2300.71 --> 2305.77
atmosphere and the ability to have a

2302.75 --> 2305.77
normal conversation

2307.21 --> 2311.53
glad to hear somebody saw it

2313.54 --> 2316.599
[Music]

2322.329 --> 2326.619
yes

2323.57 --> 2326.619
[Music]

2351.4 --> 2357.73
no drunken bullet for a woman I did not

2354.279 --> 2361.21
see that I I wouldn't even know how I

2357.73 --> 2363.249
would get to see that I I don't I'm not

2361.21 --> 2365.589
even subscribed to that into his channel

2363.249 --> 2368.98
or anything and he does that kind of

2365.589 --> 2373.15
nonsense all the time anyway it's always

2368.98 --> 2376.98
[ __ ] always I've never had seen him

2373.15 --> 2376.98
say if one legitimate thing ever

2377.64 --> 2380.7999999999997
[Music]

2385.8 --> 2394.71
hmm well Missouri bear I think it the

2391.98 --> 2402.18
whole gender multiple gender idea it's

2394.71 --> 2406.7400000000002
just no it's it's social hierarchy

2402.18 --> 2410.97
obsession driven games it's a game it's

2406.74 --> 2414.24
a social status social hierarchy based

2410.97 --> 2420.06
game psychological game that's what it

2414.24 --> 2423.5099999999998
is and to play the game and I get status

2420.06 --> 2427.7999999999997
you must sacrifice your sanity and take

2423.51 --> 2431.07
part in the game with a weird of gender

2427.8 --> 2432.53
thing whatever claim and then you go

2431.07 --> 2437.4900000000002
with it

2432.53 --> 2440.42
that's all where it's ridiculous but

2437.49 --> 2440.4199999999996
that's kind of how it works

2462.55 --> 2468.28
I don't know why you will put that in

2465.94 --> 2470.55
here Jeffrey bill why would you bring

2468.28 --> 2470.55
that up

2505.23 --> 2510.87
[Music]

2508.35 --> 2519.97
gender Wars think they are destroying

2510.87 --> 2521.14
patriarchy well I don't know what they

2519.97 --> 2526.41
think they're doing but they're

2521.14 --> 2526.41
certainly destroying common sense

2532.24 --> 2537.18
I don't know I

2535.05 --> 2540.3
you know there with the whole gender

2537.18 --> 2543.96
nonsense thing it is it is still kind of

2540.3 --> 2548.01
related indirectly to the whole well to

2543.96 --> 2551.46
atheism of course and indirectly to

2548.01 --> 2553.9500000000003
eugenics so it's so mostly how a lot of

2551.46 --> 2557.85
the gender warriors but also like oh

2553.95 --> 2560.43
yeah let's stop climate change not all

2557.85 --> 2563.49
of them care about that but it will be

2560.43 --> 2564.8999999999996
like oh yeah just people going trans is

2563.49 --> 2566.91
great because they're not gonna have

2564.9 --> 2568.05
babies it's better for the climate that

2566.91 --> 2574.79
kind of thing

2568.05 --> 2577.86
Batya I'll bet ya and I've heard people

2574.79 --> 2580.35
speak like that kind of almost yeah well

2577.86 --> 2582.54
in public it's in the Netherlands that

2580.35 --> 2584.85
kind of conversation that kind of remark

2582.54 --> 2588.81
is not uncommon

2584.85 --> 2596.7
it's not even severely looked down upon

2588.81 --> 2599.5099999999998
anymore so yeah so part of the game the

2596.7 --> 2599.5099999999998
game of spells

2649.43 --> 2656.749
yes sir for longest long pause I'm just

2652.859 --> 2656.749
wandering off in my thoughts

2657.29 --> 2661.2799999999997
[Music]

2669.78 --> 2682.03
studio 68 that hilarious that identify

2679.15 --> 2684.33
as Michael Jackson and pronouns are he

2682.03 --> 2684.3300000000004
he

2687.77 --> 2697.1
yeah well yeah you can get all kinds of

2690.44 --> 2701.5
nonsense with it but like I don't see

2697.1 --> 2704.0899999999997
the point of it it's like a sticker game

2701.5 --> 2706.69
yeah you can put a sticker on something

2704.09 --> 2709.9700000000003
you can declare you can have a name tag

2706.69 --> 2711.98
function tag whatever but it doesn't

2709.97 --> 2713.8689999999997
really mean anything it's just a social

2711.98 --> 2716.84
construct it only means something if

2713.869 --> 2721.4900000000002
people give it power give it some kind

2716.84 --> 2724.4900000000002
of social virtual Authority that is the

2721.49 --> 2726.47
only way it can mean anything because in

2724.49 --> 2728.83
the physical reality it doesn't mean

2726.47 --> 2728.83
anything

2774.95 --> 2783.609
oh damn is Brendan the pre-show no huh

2780.099 --> 2783.6090000000004
wouldn't be surprised

2788.31 --> 2793.7
Oh what's this I'm coming back

2799.21 --> 2812.5
oh she's about to get kicked butt oh wow

2809.89 --> 2816.18
I get it you can see it because you're

2812.5 --> 2816.18
in the discard panel right

2823.42 --> 2825.42
ah

2827.88 --> 2835.73
I wish could be there Brenda is

2831.93 --> 2835.73
hilarious at times

2855.83 --> 2861.83
right yeah so everybody I'm gonna round

2859.16 --> 2865.5499999999997
out the show and not too long but be

2861.83 --> 2867.2
sure to go over to Nathan Oakley's

2865.55 --> 2870.32
channel you know what I'll put a

2867.2 --> 2872.4199999999996
freaking link directly in the

2870.32 --> 2874.25
description box because yeah the battle

2872.42 --> 2885.08
notifications these days don't really

2874.25 --> 2887.15
work anymore as they should so I'm gonna

2885.08 --> 2889.88
put the link here so you can already go

2887.15 --> 2897.35
there for when it goes live which is now

2889.88 --> 2902.78
registered in five minutes no I'm I'm

2897.35 --> 2906.11
just spreading the link ahead of time so

2902.78 --> 2906.59
because that yeah sharing the link by

2906.11 --> 2908.69
now

2906.59 --> 2911.92
especially before the show is probably

2908.69 --> 2915.04
gonna help a lot more than just

2911.92 --> 2915.04
announcing it

2919.7 --> 2925.12
I'm not gone yet it's still five more

2922.97 --> 2925.12
minutes

2933.51 --> 2942.2200000000003
hmm yeah I could talk about something

2939.55 --> 2944.92
there was an interesting hang like very

2942.22 --> 2948.43
interesting I thought you watch it was

2944.92 --> 2951.04
more bit of a yeah or you could say

2948.43 --> 2955.75
witchcraft of old spiritual tradition

2951.04 --> 2958.63
type thing is from Sylvie from new earth

2955.75 --> 2962.98
and was talking about healing power and

2958.63 --> 2966.63
like destiny alteration using the spirit

2962.98 --> 2972.43
of stones and yeah that sounds very very

2966.63 --> 2975.13
mmm but the thing is no matter how silly

2972.43 --> 2978.22
that might have sounded to people that

2975.13 --> 2982.54
what she talked about it's absolutely

2978.22 --> 2984.91
100% on target and I have very very

2982.54 --> 2988.42
personal empirical experience with it

2984.91 --> 2992.44
all so it is fast it's almost like I

2988.42 --> 2995.88
forgot it a little because all these

2992.44 --> 3000.27
things do matter that you mentioned and

2995.88 --> 3002.73
stones can kind of alter get the destiny

3000.27 --> 3004.89
I it's so so hard to explain how that

3002.73 --> 3007.17
works it's like interdimensional it's

3004.89 --> 3010.41
like with its the other side and I've

3007.17 --> 3013.5
experienced that myself that I would go

3010.41 --> 3017.64
somewhere I need be like I just see this

3013.5 --> 3021.03
done and it's like what happens you've

3017.64 --> 3023.6099999999997
I've just feel like something when I

3021.03 --> 3026.73
focus at it I feel things happening in

3023.61 --> 3030.6200000000003
the future like it's very hard to really

3026.73 --> 3030.62
explain what happens

3033.4 --> 3039.9100000000003
yeah but I it's interesting I should

3036.58 --> 3048.2799999999997
look into it again oh look I have so

3039.91 --> 3050.35
many I've so many it's crazy so it would

3048.28 --> 3053.05
be good to kind of just look into it

3050.35 --> 3055.42
again see you can I do something you

3053.05 --> 3059.38
know I have a lot of well at least

3055.42 --> 3061.75
virtual or apparent dissatisfaction with

3059.38 --> 3063.4900000000002
my own personal life situation on the

3061.75 --> 3065.94
other hand yeah it's never you know

3063.49 --> 3071.2299999999996
green grass on the other side and all

3065.94 --> 3072.1
but there's just a lot that's left to be

3071.23 --> 3076.51
desired

3072.1 --> 3079.0899999999997
for my perspective in my life and I

3076.51 --> 3082.75
wonder I've been trying to figure out

3079.09 --> 3092.6200000000003
like how can I get out of this how can I

3082.75 --> 3096.64
like alter erase this apparent purely

3092.62 --> 3099.16
apparent curse that I feel I have it's

3096.64 --> 3101.14
been kind of haunting me need my healer

3099.16 --> 3102.7599999999998
for that she it's like my spirit getting

3101.14 --> 3107.31
pull of my body getting dragged into

3102.76 --> 3116.53
things that are not for me not really

3107.31 --> 3120.0299999999997
it's like my escapism has taken like

3116.53 --> 3125.2200000000003
interdimensional proportions almost and

3120.03 --> 3132.2200000000003
I just feel that it's literally a waste

3125.22 --> 3136.41
for me it's like what what do I think my

3132.22 --> 3140.8599999999997
energy is actually feeding into here and

3136.41 --> 3146.14
like just look from a God perspective is

3140.86 --> 3149.4100000000003
is that really gonna work out like even

3146.14 --> 3152.47
if it seems that it should will it

3149.41 --> 3154.5899999999997
though and I'm just starting to have

3152.47 --> 3158.2599999999998
more and more doubts more just more

3154.59 --> 3160.6800000000003
severe doubts really about influencing

3158.26 --> 3160.6800000000003
the world

3161.93 --> 3167.73
and my priorities in this that I've kind

3164.76 --> 3170.369
of like yeah but I feel that what I do

3167.73 --> 3173.22
and my focus to the world not so much

3170.369 --> 3176.28
myself makes me more effective at what I

3173.22 --> 3178.0789999999997
do well guess what from a temp

3176.28 --> 3181.9500000000003
contemporary from a temporary

3178.079 --> 3184.98
perspective that may seem true but in

3181.95 --> 3188.0099999999998
the overall picture it's becoming more

3184.98 --> 3190.8
and more clear that it is not and that

3188.01 --> 3196.26
I'm effectively completely wasting my

3190.8 --> 3200.76
own time with this because necessity

3196.26 --> 3205.3190000000004
will drive learning eventually not so

3200.76 --> 3208.579
much exposure it sounds kind of weird

3205.319 --> 3208.579
now doesn't it

3212.75 --> 3219.32
I don't know so yeah I'm I'm just be and

3217.28 --> 3222.8
I'm trying to gather energy and momentum

3219.32 --> 3226.25
and trying to figure out like I got it

3222.8 --> 3228.4100000000003
I gotta get bigger like this what I have

3226.25 --> 3231.11
here it's very cool I think I'm very

3228.41 --> 3234.68
happy to have it I'm happy to have

3231.11 --> 3236.4500000000003
people that I guess respect me

3234.68 --> 3241.94
I can appreciate me and that I

3236.45 --> 3246.9399999999996
appreciate but it's gonna sound bad it's

3241.94 --> 3251.03
not enough it's just not enough just it

3246.94 --> 3254.78
if it's this and it stays this I'm gonna

3251.03 --> 3257.1800000000003
break it can it's not enough I gotta

3254.78 --> 3259.0400000000004
fulfill my life I gotta get the rest of

3257.18 --> 3262.91
my logos no matter the cost

3259.04 --> 3269.7799999999997
I gotta get it all I gotta get it in

3262.91 --> 3273.29
some way whenever the crazy original

3269.78 --> 3277.1000000000004
ideas worth for me on the other side

3273.29 --> 3279.14
that set this life this way it just

3277.1 --> 3281.9
doesn't make sense anymore

3279.14 --> 3285.2
not even a little not even a temporary

3281.9 --> 3287.78
bit that's the whole weird thing it it

3285.2 --> 3290.7799999999997
almost even during my visions no that

3287.78 --> 3295.5800000000004
just dawned on me as I was going through

3290.78 --> 3299.75
it like the view of temporariness Trump

3295.58 --> 3304.61
triumphing over and music yep over the

3299.75 --> 3306.2
permanent as it were like almost as it

3304.61 --> 3313.21
was happening it was becoming very

3306.2 --> 3317.7799999999997
apparent that it is folly it is fully

3313.21 --> 3321.83
100% fully it is like I don't know just

3317.78 --> 3324.44
get it gives me this feeling like [ __ ]

3321.83 --> 3327.65
the Amish were right

3324.44 --> 3331.81
not they were better no they were just

3327.65 --> 3336.38
right about everything every detail like

3331.81 --> 3339.17
like super ultra mega conservative not

3336.38 --> 3344.02
bullet ik bulls [ __ ] politic

3339.17 --> 3346.14
conservative like real mega ultra

3344.02 --> 3348.24
fundamental conservatism

3346.14 --> 3349.95
that kind of thought just entered me is

3348.24 --> 3352.799
like what was I doing

3349.95 --> 3355.049
why was I even getting distracted by the

3352.799 --> 3358.079
nonsense of the world and all the Devils

3355.049 --> 3362.46
out there in the trinkets and all that

3358.079 --> 3366.0890000000004
fully when I should have just just

3362.46 --> 3370.079
focused on my life just getting a good

3366.089 --> 3376.589
life making building like that and then

3370.079 --> 3379.92
every wish what come this it would all

3376.589 --> 3381.99
come and and well I haven't

3379.92 --> 3384.75
that's not seem to be the course that

3381.99 --> 3389.64
I've been on in the last twenty thirty

3384.75 --> 3393.41
years and I wonder now can that be

3389.64 --> 3396.0
altered can I change it is that doable

3393.41 --> 3401.25
and what will the price be is it gonna

3396.0 --> 3404.569
get me killed and and then there is the

3401.25 --> 3408.9
idea does that matter does it matter

3404.569 --> 3412.049
does it matter if if I will be released

3408.9 --> 3415.7690000000002
from this insane apparent railroad in my

3412.049 --> 3419.759
life does it matter if I get killed over

3415.769 --> 3422.609
it and the more I think about it the

3419.759 --> 3427.67
more I realized that it absolutely does

3432.18 --> 3440.3689999999997
incredibly long elastic but yet never

3436.95 --> 3443.25
fulfilled life that is literal hell and

3461.579 --> 3466.13
