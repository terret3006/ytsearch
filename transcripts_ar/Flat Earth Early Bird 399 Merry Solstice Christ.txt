[Music]

31.71 --> 33.769
you

37.67 --> 45.03
good morning welcome to flat earther

41.85 --> 46.589
early-bird number 399 I'm your host

45.03 --> 48.51
Arwen and before we start the show

46.589 --> 49.739
please don't forget to share it on any

48.51 --> 51.69
platform you deem fit

49.739 --> 53.43
and if you haven't already subscribed to

51.69 --> 55.349999999999994
my channel and it's a bail notification

53.43 --> 57.299
so you know when I'm going live which is

55.35 --> 60.089
normally 2 p.m. I'm so damn time every

57.299 --> 61.949
day please do support me through the

60.089 --> 64.35
paypal page from my GoFundMe and the

61.949 --> 68.67
super chats that'll be much appreciated

64.35 --> 73.619
so yeah merry Christmas everyone

68.67 --> 79.56
the second Christmas Day it's kind of

73.619 --> 81.72
mild outside although there's a lot of

79.56 --> 83.42
moist in the air and get kind of cold as

81.72 --> 90.299
soon as the wind starts blowing a bit

83.42 --> 94.02
but yeah it's been pretty nice so yeah I

90.299 --> 99.78
was as expected yesterday just sick all

94.02 --> 102.42
day so and in the mornings was yeah I

99.78 --> 108.899
just decided to go sleeping again is

102.42 --> 111.149
left so much hmm like crazy times like I

108.899 --> 113.009
sleep 2 hours and then be awake for

111.149 --> 116.55
another two hours and sleep four hours

113.009 --> 122.7
and then be awake and then six I don't

116.55 --> 125.179
know I was all over the place after

122.7 --> 125.179
Tuesday

127.4 --> 136.27
did I learn something about Xmas yes

130.99 --> 136.27
well that recording was awhile ago so

136.66 --> 144.04999999999998
yeah let me go through chat for a moment

139.28 --> 146.93
I got green tea with me although I'm

144.05 --> 150.38000000000002
almost like maybe I shouldn't have done

146.93 --> 154.22
that seems to have some negative effects

150.38 --> 155.6
a little achy but yeah I'll just go back

154.22 --> 158.33
to minty which is what I've been

155.6 --> 158.98
drinking like all day long and night

158.33 --> 164.51000000000002
long

158.98 --> 171.53
yesterday yeah didn't barely ate

164.51 --> 175.91
anything but it was okay just fasting

171.53 --> 181.46
work sometimes especially when I have

175.91 --> 184.49
jaw aches then I just don't use it and I

181.46 --> 187.34
ate some soup and yeah you don't have to

184.49 --> 189.62
chew that so that was just great I like

187.34 --> 191.87
the way I was able to handle the

189.62 --> 194.63
situation and therefore the painful

191.87 --> 197.27
length of it was relatively short could

194.63 --> 200.6
have lasted longer even though it's not

197.27 --> 203.9
over yet but this is just the half it's

200.6 --> 207.1
like a bit whiny and but not really

203.9 --> 210.09
painful anymore and I can't chew or so

207.1 --> 216.599
carefully

210.09 --> 219.209
ah anyway let's see was in chat IDM was

216.599 --> 222.44
first very early in this morning and

219.209 --> 225.69
Giulio Pavan good servant Tom Parker

222.44 --> 227.01
I've been over at secret Asian man's the

225.69 --> 230.39
life channel at hua

227.01 --> 234.17999999999998
he's been playing some really good video

230.39 --> 241.58999999999997
presentations this guy what's his name

234.18 --> 245.25
again mark I think and yeah he's not a

241.59 --> 247.59
flat earther but beside that everything

245.25 --> 250.86
else about religion and the origins and

247.59 --> 253.95000000000002
deception and rearranging of history the

250.86 --> 257.459
guy so well studied and like he rides

253.95 --> 260.37
his own he does presentation that's just

257.459 --> 262.86
his thing and does its of every detail

260.37 --> 266.51
so you know he's put in like hours and

262.86 --> 272.34000000000003
like hundreds of hours potentially into

266.51 --> 277.229
finally arranging the way he's gonna say

272.34 --> 279.81
it let me see if I can find it the admin

277.229 --> 285.99
watching the last quite some time it was

279.81 --> 288.93
really good so you'd think that he knows

285.99 --> 290.97
about Flat Earth what is just not

288.93 --> 294.419
talking about it and he doesn't talk

290.97 --> 298.22
about globe either like specifically not

294.419 --> 298.21999999999997
it's very interesting

301.849 --> 308.149
all right but the thing is Tom Parker is

304.709 --> 308.149
that his approach is so good

308.58 --> 312.839
[Music]

310.159 --> 317.029
no I don't watch super rats

312.839 --> 317.029
jeno I have no idea what he's doing

322.18 --> 335.29
anyway let me continue the list right

326.47 --> 340.65000000000003
Missouri bear Stacy be Martin Ellen said

335.29 --> 340.65000000000003
he's sorry to Cosentino over moco

343.02 --> 357.88
William because Sandra woods Oh mark of

348.52 --> 360.29999999999995
Melbourne tiny wubble yeah good to see

357.88 --> 360.3
you all

367.15 --> 373.23999999999995
right but yeah me an Asian secret Asian

370.449 --> 374.91900000000004
man were just chatting in his chat just

373.24 --> 376.74
the two of us mostly I think that

374.919 --> 380.28999999999996
Missouri bear subscribed to him but

376.74 --> 381.43
didn't join the chat we've been talking

380.29 --> 386.72900000000004
for like two hours

381.43 --> 386.729
before this dream hey Irving Johnson's

407.49 --> 414.81
Oh is there anything specific you wanted

411.09 --> 418.81899999999996
to share about it I don't really want to

414.81 --> 421.59
feed into cliques I don't want my Google

418.819 --> 423.389
my youtube search engine to start

421.59 --> 428.25
recommending his [ __ ] again because it

423.389 --> 433.199
like it wants me to do that so as soon

428.25 --> 435.96
as I click then starts shoving it in my

433.199 --> 442.68
face again trying to learn their little

435.96 --> 444.78
YouTube tries to troll bait so but if

442.68 --> 450.62
you can be more specific about what it

444.78 --> 450.61999999999995
was about don't mind hearing it

455.3 --> 465.54
yeah damn ikan yes yeah Sandra woods

463.62 --> 467.97
well that's not gonna happen you know I

465.54 --> 470.52000000000004
tried I constantly click those

467.97 --> 475.17
recommendations away it'll just keep on

470.52 --> 476.66999999999996
it's it's paid to do that and we are

475.17 --> 480.24
flat earthers it's never gonna stop

476.67 --> 486.24
doing that but yeah at least you can

480.24 --> 488.88
keep yourself away from trolls because

486.24 --> 491.28000000000003
like every time for example I I just

488.88 --> 493.86
clicked on going to sorry man ban or

491.28 --> 495.57
anything just once and actually looking

493.86 --> 497.01
the video for something and then be

495.57 --> 499.2
really annoyed clicked away then it

497.01 --> 502.15999999999997
would constantly for like a week long

499.2 --> 504.11
shafts I'm and then videos in my face

502.16 --> 506.40000000000003
seriously

504.11 --> 508.71000000000004
it never does that with any other

506.4 --> 510.17999999999995
channel I'm really interested in except

508.71 --> 516.86
for the Flat Earth debates because yeah

510.18 --> 518.429
I'm doing that like every day so but not

516.86 --> 521.999
rarely even that

518.429 --> 521.999
[Music]

531.75 --> 540.019
the space X last rocket launch with a

535.529 --> 540.019
mice reading on the booster rocking what

540.649 --> 550.829
what my god what has happens I've been

547.56 --> 553.8
sick for one day and like hearing all

550.829 --> 561.6289999999999
these crazy stories here over mukha what

553.8 --> 564.54
is that yeah a flatlander I get I've

561.629 --> 572.6700000000001
been getting them for for more than a

564.54 --> 579.949
few times right this is he wants it's a

572.67 --> 579.949
wizard school they're trying to recruit

582.07 --> 590.369
[Music]

600.24 --> 606.569
yeah it's expensive of course it is yeah

604.319 --> 609.74
but more colored adblock is not really

606.569 --> 612.959
that great because adblock also prevents

609.74 --> 616.499
yeah people that have monetize channels

612.959 --> 619.05
from getting income from their ads no

616.499 --> 620.9390000000001
matter how annoying they are usually you

619.05 --> 623.189
can click them away like after five

620.939 --> 628.5889999999999
seconds or it's just some stupid box you

623.189 --> 631.29
can exce away so to be fair most of my

628.589 --> 634.23
google income comes from those stupid

631.29 --> 638.3389999999999
ads and i'd totally agree I hate ads

634.23 --> 643.679
actually but I just trying to crawl out

638.339 --> 648.869
of what I do or well out of my financial

643.679 --> 651.779
predicament and yeah I have basically

648.869 --> 654.9590000000001
placed a professional bet on being a

651.779 --> 657.629
live streamer and a youtuber in this

654.959 --> 659.81
case although I'm very interested in

657.629 --> 663.02
other platforms as well

659.81 --> 663.02
[Music]

668.86 --> 671.79
whitelist

682.49 --> 687.92
okay I'll take a look at that what

698.0 --> 700.66
oh wait

705.769 --> 710.23
20 minutes 25 okay

716.94 --> 726.1400000000001
well I think it's just saw that but is

723.69 --> 726.1400000000001
it a mouse

738.85 --> 748.869
whoa it is so I don't know if that's a

746.589 --> 752.2890000000001
mouse but it does almost seem like one

748.869 --> 754.619
that's like twirling around yeah that is

752.289 --> 757.619
weird okay yeah sure I'll show it

754.619 --> 757.619
Salieri's

762.36 --> 765.2
all right

776.55 --> 779.3299999999999
that way

782.95 --> 790.7
to the right going pop there you go that

787.69 --> 792.5
but it stopped it just stopped me there

790.7 --> 797.4200000000001
that doesn't make any sense to be a real

792.5 --> 799.97
mouse but I don't know what else it's

797.42 --> 804.2299999999999
would supposed well yeah what would that

799.97 --> 807.46
supposed to be what should that I'm not

804.23 --> 807.46
doing great with my words

824.12 --> 828.8
yeah playing down its yeah but it

827.87 --> 831.98
doesn't really matter

828.8 --> 834.3789999999999
uber local I can see why you think that

831.98 --> 838.12
that could be a mouse but the way it

834.379 --> 840.9490000000001
just stops and freezes at the last part

838.12 --> 844.97
that shows me that whatever that is it's

840.949 --> 849.199
not alive because it just stops

844.97 --> 851.2090000000001
completely freeze frame yeah for like

849.199 --> 852.019
more than a second that's not what I'm

851.209 --> 857.3889999999999
eyes would do

852.019 --> 863.48
see that's just stops it it doesn't make

857.389 --> 865.819
any sense so and that she would say it

863.48 --> 869.29
was a mouse that no that's ridiculous it

865.819 --> 869.29
would have roasted but

873.64 --> 884.6999999999999
okay right how do you slow down how does

880.6 --> 884.7
that work I don't know

891.709 --> 898.6289999999999
settings playback speed alright okay

900.04 --> 903.189
here we go

930.93 --> 941.3
okay there comes think yeah there it

943.85 --> 948.61
see how it just stops in place that's

956.55 --> 963.9
it's just something over Mukul brought

959.64 --> 968.24
up he thinks he saw a mouse running over

963.9 --> 968.24
the side here but I totally disagree

977.699 --> 980.699
anyway

988.37 --> 993.35
yeah enough about that sir

997.279 --> 1001.649
start real videos what

1008.279 --> 1011.569
when you're talking about

1040.88 --> 1043.8390000000002
hmm

1046.82 --> 1052.9399999999998
okay mark of Melbourne oh yeah exposing

1051.17 --> 1061.49
it's an interesting thing to know I

1052.94 --> 1067.24
guess yeah thank you for applying

1061.49 --> 1069.59
concerning that thing from Antonio Marez

1067.24 --> 1071.96
apparently he is exposing that the

1069.59 --> 1074.09
equinox dates are six weeks apart for

1071.96 --> 1076.8500000000001
only four degrees north and south of the

1074.09 --> 1080.77
Equator on the equinoxes according to

1076.85 --> 1080.77
Sun calculator okay

1098.53 --> 1106.6789999999999
No

1100.96 --> 1109.33
all right it will Brian Leakey right

1106.679 --> 1113.5590000000002
that's funny that you're throwing that

1109.33 --> 1115.96
out there if the wave function is purely

1113.559 --> 1119.74
mathematical and knowledge of to which

1115.96 --> 1123.159
path collapses but nothing but the math

1119.74 --> 1126.52
will know because it's still an effect

1123.159 --> 1130.659
right the wave function which is only

1126.52 --> 1133.57
the dispersal pattern has to do with the

1130.659 --> 1135.909
close proximity of light energy to

1133.57 --> 1139.99
matter changing its path in a specific

1135.909 --> 1143.7990000000002
type which when deduced the pattern

1139.99 --> 1146.11
seems very similar to waves but it isn't

1143.799 --> 1149.5
but it is a dispersal pattern and that

1146.11 --> 1151.74
is still real and the which path

1149.5 --> 1156.029
knowledge knowledge is supposed to

1151.74 --> 1159.7
collapse that effect making all the

1156.029 --> 1163.45
presumed particles of light only go

1159.7 --> 1171.1000000000001
straight and no longer deviate which is

1163.45 --> 1175.3300000000002
very odd to me almost start to wonder if

1171.1 --> 1178.299
they like with this slit how wide is

1175.33 --> 1181.539
that slit and don't they just fire that

1178.299 --> 1184.149
specific amount of light exactly through

1181.539 --> 1187.899
the middle of it because that is where

1184.149 --> 1192.9089999999999
that detector sensor is because in that

1187.899 --> 1194.4399999999998
way yeah that makes kind of sense but I

1192.909 --> 1199.179
do yeah I don't know exactly how its

1194.44 --> 1201.64
setup I don't know but yeah I've been

1199.179 --> 1204.789
hearing more and more doubts about that

1201.64 --> 1207.22
whole set up the particle light

1204.789 --> 1208.419
assumption is so grounded into much of

1207.22 --> 1213.789
what comes out of it

1208.419 --> 1218.6200000000001
but it it seems like a cover-up really

1213.789 --> 1220.33
for other things and I wonder if yeah if

1218.62 --> 1222.07
there could ever be some kind of

1220.33 --> 1225.9399999999998
demonstration of this wavefunction

1222.07 --> 1228.97
collapse like an actual visual

1225.94 --> 1231.789
demonstration where interactively you

1228.97 --> 1233.929
could just yeah just like I like

1231.789 --> 1236.33
Lightspeed can be deduced and

1233.929 --> 1238.45
interacting the interacting with the

1236.33 --> 1242.259
distance the light is travelling

1238.45 --> 1244.97
literally making a delay slightly in in

1242.259 --> 1247.48
microseconds or whatever that amount was

1244.97 --> 1251.3600000000001
that was the deuced from it that is like

1247.48 --> 1256.039
empirically interactively very

1251.36 --> 1258.11
manipulating that the effect it's not

1256.039 --> 1260.269
science I don't care about that but it's

1258.11 --> 1264.1999999999998
just that is the most imperiled you can

1260.269 --> 1268.429
get so what I want is that type of setup

1264.2 --> 1273.919
demonstrated with this wavefunction

1268.429 --> 1284.48
collapse effect but I've never seen it

1273.919 --> 1287.029
demonstrated ever it's all stories so

1284.48 --> 1290.21
it's light a particle well I don't think

1287.029 --> 1292.549
so because what typically comes with

1290.21 --> 1299.259
particle you could say it's a globule

1292.549 --> 1302.509
maybe because whether it is yeah like a

1299.259 --> 1305.99
globule that can be infinitely small of

1302.509 --> 1308.21
energy or whether it is a ray that I

1305.99 --> 1310.369
think is a better way to approach it

1308.21 --> 1313.279
that is infinitely splittable because

1310.369 --> 1316.73
light never stands still right

1313.279 --> 1320.629
it never really does you can get in it's

1316.73 --> 1325.429
always traversing you can't get it it

1320.629 --> 1330.799
either transverses or it's absorbs it is

1325.429 --> 1334.22
absorbed so I think that a ray a beam

1330.799 --> 1338.059
that can be split up and altered and

1334.22 --> 1340.039
whatever in many kinds of ways that that

1338.059 --> 1344.019
is a more sensible approach to what

1340.039 --> 1350.139
light really is and not a indivisible

1344.019 --> 1350.139
particle of energy quanta

1360.529 --> 1372.38
transported as a wave through the ether

1362.88 --> 1372.38
no no it's just a beam it

1375.13 --> 1379.0590000000002
explain is it just

1383.25 --> 1390.659
it's just a beam and I don't know that's

1385.98 --> 1392.82
what it does but look it's the particle

1390.659 --> 1394.74
nature is not even important what I

1392.82 --> 1398.34
think that the whole particle ization

1394.74 --> 1401.429
was is to make everything into these

1398.34 --> 1405.12
ball units in the micro world in order

1401.429 --> 1408.75
for them to go to the hide room collider

1405.12 --> 1411.6589999999999
and all that to make everything into

1408.75 --> 1416.34
those micro units and use that as as as

1411.659 --> 1418.0490000000002
a new divining ground to fund a lot of

1416.34 --> 1423.11
money in that and so they can do their

1418.049 --> 1423.11
freaky experiments with no real purpose

1427.23 --> 1432.529
yeah it's balls all the way down as well

1429.75 --> 1432.529
yeah everywhere

1447.66 --> 1452.1200000000001
what what channel

1467.27 --> 1471.47
what are you talking about flatlander I

1469.82 --> 1475.24
have no idea what you're talking about

1471.47 --> 1475.24
you first you ask something about

1475.51 --> 1482.41
trouble about star trail videos I have

1479.15 --> 1482.41
no idea of what that is

1482.77 --> 1488.45
that's something supposed to be

1484.55 --> 1490.72
somebody's channel no idea who that is

1488.45 --> 1495.73
[Music]

1490.72 --> 1495.73
trouble about okay never heard of it

1523.1 --> 1526.8899999999999
yeah I'm gonna visit my dad but that's

1526.47 --> 1529.52
today

1526.89 --> 1533.94
second Christmas day so I'll probably be

1529.52 --> 1537.6
in be going there in one half hour from

1533.94 --> 1540.8400000000001
now something like that I'm expecting a

1537.6 --> 1543.23
phone call and he from somewhere in the

1540.84 --> 1543.23
next hour

1550.41 --> 1555.78
all right but yeah as for let's get back

1554.4 --> 1557.64
for a moment to something really

1555.78 --> 1563.3999999999999
interesting I always like your

1557.64 --> 1566.2800000000002
conversations Missouri bear transport it

1563.4 --> 1574.89
as a way through the ether light again

1566.28 --> 1578.28
right hmm well maybe maybe in a way but

1574.89 --> 1580.71
I think it's rather like the ether as I

1578.28 --> 1585.54
as I have learned about it seems to be

1580.71 --> 1589.71
more like a big field of energy that's

1585.54 --> 1595.2
just on the other side as it were it's

1589.71 --> 1597.81
just not in direct reach and that energy

1595.2 --> 1600.0
is somehow interconnected with the

1597.81 --> 1603.69
matter in certain ways and it matter

1600.0 --> 1606.63
resonance and and I think there's a lot

1603.69 --> 1611.01
to it and I think that light may also be

1606.63 --> 1612.7800000000002
the ether basically unleashed through

1611.01 --> 1616.05
some kind of critical momentum but I

1612.78 --> 1620.3999999999999
don't think that light transverses

1616.05 --> 1621.84
through the ether because it has a fixed

1620.4 --> 1625.77
amount of energy and it is being

1621.84 --> 1630.87
absorbed as it transverses matter so

1625.77 --> 1633.57
there's no perpetual amount of energy it

1630.87 --> 1635.9399999999998
just it goes the distance and it goes

1633.57 --> 1639.6
through it and it has like the an

1635.94 --> 1643.65
average constant speed you could say as

1639.6 --> 1647.6399999999999
a the original frequency a certain speed

1643.65 --> 1652.02
and then it can slow down and it can

1647.64 --> 1655.7700000000002
speed up but it will have the same

1652.02 --> 1661.3799999999999
average as it were so maybe it's more

1655.77 --> 1663.24
like a snare between the biggity between

1661.38 --> 1665.0400000000002
the origin where it is Unleashed from

1663.24 --> 1667.83
the ether and the endpoint where

1665.04 --> 1670.44
everything is finally absorbed and just

1667.83 --> 1672.57
yeah it resonates and depending on the

1670.44 --> 1675.39
thickness of the matter it goes slower

1672.57 --> 1678.11
or faster but it's actually moving

1675.39 --> 1678.1100000000001
through it

1680.2 --> 1689.8600000000001
but there's no literal wave going on

1683.98 --> 1689.8600000000001
it's just an yeah a metaphor really

1694.16 --> 1699.23
yeah Missouri bear light is confusing

1696.41 --> 1703.15
you know what is the most confusing of

1699.23 --> 1706.25
all the freaking Sun it's just like okay

1703.15 --> 1711.5300000000002
I'm pretty sure that the Sun is not some

1706.25 --> 1714.65
big object floating around within the

1711.53 --> 1717.26
realm and probably not out of well not

1714.65 --> 1719.27
physically outside of the realm and it's

1717.26 --> 1721.16
just some way where the ether is

1719.27 --> 1725.71
unleashing this giant amount of light

1721.16 --> 1725.71
upon the world for a specific pattern

1730.21 --> 1737.77
but it is surreal it's like a hole from

1734.18 --> 1737.77
which all this light is released

1749.48 --> 1752.66
[Music]

1757.09 --> 1771.1
[Music]

1759.52 --> 1771.1
whoa damn six kids not not bad

1777.46 --> 1780.93
although I kind of

1782.999 --> 1791.8790000000001
now I think I think I know who you are

1818.86 --> 1829.1499999999999
okay Larry de March I have no idea who

1824.96 --> 1829.15
that guy is never heard of them

1872.95 --> 1878.99
right yeah I don't know why people would

1876.919 --> 1883.2800000000002
delete their channels over being wrong

1878.99 --> 1886.09
about something like any flat earther

1883.28 --> 1889.8799999999999
that thinks that it's just gonna be easy

1886.09 --> 1894.6399999999999
to defeat this massive worldwide baller

1889.88 --> 1896.96
cult sir yeah are up for some tough luck

1894.64 --> 1899.0590000000002
so if you're gonna delete your channel

1896.96 --> 1900.82
because you were wrong about something

1899.059 --> 1904.1299999999999
one time

1900.82 --> 1906.8899999999999
that's just panic is dumb

1904.13 --> 1911.71
you know it's much better to just figure

1906.89 --> 1914.5900000000001
it out and then just correct yourself

1911.71 --> 1917.9
but yeah on the other hand you know

1914.59 --> 1920.1499999999999
despite because I know this argument

1917.9 --> 1922.0400000000002
it's based on the moon cycles and

1920.15 --> 1925.16
daytime how it could be possible

1922.04 --> 1928.61
it doesn't really prove the moon is any

1925.16 --> 1931.0400000000002
ball though because yeah the way the

1928.61 --> 1935.54
shadow works that that doesn't make any

1931.04 --> 1941.8999999999999
sense really it's it doesn't even look

1935.54 --> 1944.4189999999999
like how light would hit a ball doesn't

1941.9 --> 1945.44
even look like that that's not how that

1944.419 --> 1949.63
shadow works

1945.44 --> 1949.63
that's not how shadow works

1951.96 --> 1960.3890000000001
so yeah it seems like that's why I say

1956.82 --> 1962.61
you know I bet there's just people out

1960.389 --> 1965.309
there that will become temporary

1962.61 --> 1969.6589999999999
flat-earthers out of nowhere and then

1965.309 --> 1971.369
delete their channel just to give the

1969.659 --> 1974.7
ballers a little bit more hope that they

1971.369 --> 1976.529
can actually win any argument and that

1974.7 --> 1982.8500000000001
it will result in us going away

1976.529 --> 1982.85
especially that very very false hope so

1988.97 --> 1996.8990000000001
okay yeah well that's just dumb why

1994.71 --> 2005.21
would you do that that is so savonia

1996.899 --> 2008.4799999999998
that is so [ __ ] adolescent it's

2005.21 --> 2014.539
really dumb for any why would you do

2008.48 --> 2017.1390000000001
that get more stuff on yay clicks it's

2014.539 --> 2017.139
just [ __ ]

2022.2 --> 2028.18
yeah never bet if you're if you're are

2026.14 --> 2031.48
actually serious at what you do never

2028.18 --> 2035.53
bet the deletion of your channel on

2031.48 --> 2037.89
something don't be that dumb just don't

2035.53 --> 2037.8899999999999
do that

2038.31 --> 2043.4199999999998
besides for flat earthers in this case

2041.32 --> 2044.5
for real flat earthers if you want to do

2043.42 --> 2046.51
that with ballers

2044.5 --> 2049.75
they're never gonna delete their channel

2046.51 --> 2054.25
anyway I've never seen a baller ever

2049.75 --> 2057.159
haul to any bet ever with a flat earther

2054.25 --> 2059.159
I've never seen it it's been rolling for

2057.159 --> 2064.1690000000003
a while okay

2059.159 --> 2064.1690000000003
so just don't go there

2069.619 --> 2074.059
and yeah what glow burs do among one

2072.079 --> 2077.599
another in their special little

2074.059 --> 2079.73
brotherhood that's their prerogative but

2077.599 --> 2084.139
I've never seen a globe or uphold

2079.73 --> 2085.039
they're part of an argument a bet with a

2084.139 --> 2087.559
flat earther

2085.039 --> 2090.98
ever it's like principle that they break

2087.559 --> 2092.7490000000003
every rule they can whenever they can

2090.98 --> 2095.899
win no matter the cost

2092.749 --> 2101.23
at all cost like even when it's not

2095.899 --> 2104.359
necessary just just complete anti

2101.23 --> 2115.359
complete Antichrist when it comes to

2104.359 --> 2115.359
shove really yeah

2134.72 --> 2147.02
mmm that's an incomplete sentence and

2137.839 --> 2154.54
that's dumb if there was an attempt at

2147.02 --> 2154.54
sarcasm threatening risky grounds here

2181.38 --> 2184.53
all right

2187.55 --> 2193.19
yeah first off there is no zero-g

2190.07 --> 2195.52
environment but what you mean is when

2193.19 --> 2198.9500000000003
you account for the standard

2195.52 --> 2201.92
acceleration rate of this equilibrium

2198.95 --> 2206.87
but in the relative densities like in a

2201.92 --> 2208.73
diving plane yeah why does water when

2206.87 --> 2212.45
perfectly kind of it has to be perfect

2208.73 --> 2214.64
it's not easy to do that right it's very

2212.45 --> 2218.66
difficult to maintain that you have to

2214.64 --> 2220.0099999999998
like really accelerate to account for it

2218.66 --> 2222.56
perfectly but yeah

2220.01 --> 2224.8100000000004
water a body of water when unleashed

2222.56 --> 2227.0499999999997
will kind of shape itself into a ball

2224.81 --> 2229.25
because of surface tension that's

2227.05 --> 2233.27
quality of water so will other

2229.25 --> 2238.25
substances like oil definitely also do

2233.27 --> 2239.96
that it's not really a zero-g

2238.25 --> 2244.6
environment though although it's very

2239.96 --> 2248.38
easy to call it that it's morally yeah a

2244.6 --> 2253.0299999999997
relative density this equilibrium

2248.38 --> 2253.03
neutralized scenario

2257.65 --> 2263.98
yeah I'll bet you that gas is not gonna

2260.559 --> 2266.009
stick into a ball in a zero-g

2263.98 --> 2266.009
environment

2292.589 --> 2300.359
oh wow thank you da studio 20 Australian

2298.529 --> 2302.599
dollar superjet donation thank you very

2300.359 --> 2302.5989999999997
much

2302.719 --> 2308.599
merry Christmas to you know

2314.2 --> 2318.9689999999996
[Music]

2329.34 --> 2335.4900000000002
Oh how would the world being flat our

2333.27 --> 2338.25
globe impact anyone's life outside of

2335.49 --> 2343.16
claiming to have special knowledge well

2338.25 --> 2345.81
it impacts it really comes down to that

2343.16 --> 2347.7599999999998
because it is a lie and every day and

2345.81 --> 2352.44
the way it is constructed and the way it

2347.76 --> 2355.1400000000003
is upheld all of that all just shows you

2352.44 --> 2359.91
that on which side it is and if you're

2355.14 --> 2362.31
very serious about what is what is good

2359.91 --> 2366.0299999999997
and what is wise where you should be

2362.31 --> 2368.82
going with your life then eventually you

2366.03 --> 2374.46
will figure out that you're going to

2368.82 --> 2379.9500000000003
have to cast it aside because you you

2374.46 --> 2383.94
submit yourself to Liars because you can

2379.95 --> 2386.06
figure out they are lying and even many

2383.94 --> 2389.4
people that are still ball believers

2386.06 --> 2393.99
recognize that NASA allies big time and

2389.4 --> 2395.61
so do all the others they even for a

2393.99 --> 2399.0299999999997
while have big doubts but I still

2395.61 --> 2401.31
thought yeah but maybe it couldn't be

2399.03 --> 2404.3700000000003
done after all they just didn't want to

2401.31 --> 2410.73
do it it's too much hassle or something

2404.37 --> 2415.17
you know so yeah

2410.73 --> 2417.6
you can't really be on that side you can

2415.17 --> 2420.0
still look in my opinion you can still

2417.6 --> 2423.56
say look if you presuppose certain

2420.0 --> 2426.0
things then there may be something to it

2423.56 --> 2427.5
but yeah it's not gonna be a ball there

2426.0 --> 2430.98
it's not gonna be a ball but who knows

2427.5 --> 2434.55
what is up there and even my theory of

2430.98 --> 2438.8
holographic lights if a lot of hints but

2434.55 --> 2443.34
I haven't like definitively proven it

2438.8 --> 2446.13
like for absolute there's yeah I don't

2443.34 --> 2452.81
even know the real orientation of the

2446.13 --> 2452.81
realm yet so of the equator line

2456.18 --> 2463.779
but yeah being exposed to Flat Earth and

2460.93 --> 2466.749
what goes down when you do it is a big

2463.779 --> 2470.559
revelation to what is interwoven into

2466.749 --> 2473.4599999999996
society and also just all these social

2470.559 --> 2477.789
constructs mechanisms that have been

2473.46 --> 2482.64
indoctrinated into general human culture

2477.789 --> 2485.289
and people don't even realize what it is

2482.64 --> 2487.239
it's just a belief system but they don't

2485.289 --> 2488.8590000000004
know it is a belief system it's just

2487.239 --> 2494.289
what they've been talking as is the

2488.859 --> 2498.13
truth and too complicated and you know

2494.289 --> 2502.7490000000003
all the sayings so language has even

2498.13 --> 2510.9100000000003
been adapted to make it work you see

2502.749 --> 2512.9199999999996
this in America like no other place it

2510.91 --> 2519.43
does it has a huge impact on life

2512.92 --> 2524.369
because it shows you what is happening

2519.43 --> 2528.97
to humanity what has been done to us and

2524.369 --> 2530.88
what things really mean because to

2528.97 --> 2534.8999999999996
ballerz a lot of things are just

2530.88 --> 2538.9300000000003
relatively trivial they don't see it

2534.9 --> 2543.819
they see so little of what they actually

2538.93 --> 2547.509
do because they think it's all trivial

2543.819 --> 2552.609
or a lot of it and maybe they'll have

2547.509 --> 2555.759
like moral inspirations I did a lot but

2552.609 --> 2559.15
as an atheist I just overlooked so much

2555.759 --> 2563.319
I couldn't feel the careful strands of

2559.15 --> 2567.2200000000003
it all because I just it was I didn't

2563.319 --> 2569.0099999999998
see it and it's taken me a lot of time

2567.22 --> 2571.6699999999996
to get there

2569.01 --> 2573.69
even though I did kind of believe in it

2571.67 --> 2575.64
but it didn't really know what I

2573.69 --> 2577.2000000000003
believed and I just knew there was

2575.64 --> 2579.54
something there and that absolute cult

2577.2 --> 2582.39
atheism was total [ __ ] I just knew

2579.54 --> 2585.95
that like no there's definitely

2582.39 --> 2588.96
something like that I didn't know what

2585.95 --> 2593.0099999999998
was it like this mysterious ancient

2588.96 --> 2595.23
creator beings or was it indeed a an

2593.01 --> 2597.57
all-powerful creator but how does that

2595.23 --> 2601.02
work and like the moral implications I

2597.57 --> 2604.55
couldn't handle it and yeah I had that

2601.02 --> 2608.64
whole struggle but I had a lot of lot of

2604.55 --> 2611.73
moral inspirations I really liked

2608.64 --> 2616.43
righteousness I function well under

2611.73 --> 2616.43
righteousness the real thing

2623.51 --> 2628.3900000000003
so I hope that answer some of the

2626.09 --> 2628.3900000000003
questions

2638.06 --> 2644.85
was this boy

2641.59 --> 2644.8500000000004
why are you sucking

2680.03 --> 2683.7200000000003
get out

2694.15 --> 2701.71
yeah Patricia stairs coming back in 2020

2697.749 --> 2703.5389999999998
I guess but she's doing something else

2701.71 --> 2706.92
now yeah I'm curious to see what's gonna

2703.539 --> 2706.92
come from that I have no idea

2714.98 --> 2719.63
[Music]

2733.62 --> 2741.5099999999998
okay Colin optin you're asking the same

2737.16 --> 2745.5
question again I said if you don't know

2741.51 --> 2748.7700000000004
about it if you don't know about the

2745.5 --> 2752.19
lies at all you're very you're going to

2748.77 --> 2755.43
be very inclined to go with what is said

2752.19 --> 2758.61
to be real and that means you will

2755.43 --> 2760.91
probably put your hopes on things that

2758.61 --> 2764.9100000000003
are not real you're gonna be a huge

2760.91 --> 2768.27
detriment in your ignorance towards

2764.91 --> 2770.7
society and towards your fellow man

2768.27 --> 2773.97
because your ignorance is making you

2770.7 --> 2776.8799999999997
make choices that are really not good

2773.97 --> 2779.37
for you because they are choices that

2776.88 --> 2784.25
involve people that you think are great

2779.37 --> 2784.25
that are just unavoidably liars

2788.73 --> 2794.55
and are not going to be part of a

2790.74 --> 2802.3799999999997
organization that is having everybody's

2794.55 --> 2804.42
best interest at heart because yeah

2802.38 --> 2807.06
organizations that lie about almost

2804.42 --> 2809.31
everything usually do not tend to have

2807.06 --> 2812.09
everybody's best interest at heart if

2809.31 --> 2812.09
you know what I mean

2826.26 --> 2837.0400000000004
all right because yeah with the whole

2830.8 --> 2840.01
space thing you know it's first you have

2837.04 --> 2843.46
now the look what they want you to do

2840.01 --> 2846.13
first is fall in love with space stay

2843.46 --> 2850.0
fallen in love with space and then

2846.13 --> 2852.07
eventually that yeah first they get you

2850.0 --> 2853.69
used to regular astronaut things and

2852.07 --> 2855.82
everything and then you get the idea

2853.69 --> 2858.13
okay you can go to space this is for the

2855.82 --> 2860.5
people that are not aware right well

2858.13 --> 2863.86
there's also a transhumanist agenda

2860.5 --> 2866.92
going on it's already setting its foot

2863.86 --> 2868.65
with the freaky transgender situation

2866.92 --> 2871.0
that's even being put in schools now

2868.65 --> 2875.25
that's gonna further it what transgender

2871.0 --> 2878.77
is literally one step on that ladder to

2875.25 --> 2880.51
transhumanism and what eventually they

2878.77 --> 2882.16
will try to do first they're gonna the

2880.51 --> 2884.7400000000002
sounds totally crazy but they're gonna

2882.16 --> 2886.75
get like transsexuals in space but not

2884.74 --> 2889.2099999999996
like oh there are hidden trainees or

2886.75 --> 2891.37
like some of the people worthier thought

2889.21 --> 2894.58
flatter though hidden trainees in it

2891.37 --> 2897.1
[ __ ] phobia and that's just stupid

2894.58 --> 2899.88
really it's a total waste of time but I

2897.1 --> 2904.39
think they'll boot do it more publicly

2899.88 --> 2907.33
no real transsexuals up there openly

2904.39 --> 2909.04
that kind of thing that's what we can

2907.33 --> 2912.81
probably expect and then they're gonna

2909.04 --> 2916.14
migrate it on to people that are like

2912.81 --> 2917.38
partially robotic or have some kind of

2916.14 --> 2919.87
yeah

2917.38 --> 2924.13
robotic enhancement or whatever brain

2919.87 --> 2927.46
chip something some of the preliminaries

2924.13 --> 2930.28
of complete transhumanism and yeah

2927.46 --> 2932.83
eventually it'll get to the point that

2930.28 --> 2935.59
whatever is going around they'll then

2932.83 --> 2938.11
say okay look you for everybody that's

2935.59 --> 2939.67
already come with us sort of there's

2938.11 --> 2941.53
this way you can all get on our

2939.67 --> 2946.54
spaceship but you have to be fully

2941.53 --> 2949.09
digitized something like that and then

2946.54 --> 2954.31
you get on that spaceship so supposedly

2949.09 --> 2956.32
and that way yeah it's all taken out it

2954.31 --> 2959.41
sounds really like a crazy science

2956.32 --> 2965.7400000000002
fiction reality thing but I don't

2959.41 --> 2968.47
it's that far off that the whole

2965.74 --> 2972.819
transsexual ization is literally and in

2968.47 --> 2974.98
the between step with with yeah just

2972.819 --> 2980.5
come cyborg

2974.98 --> 2983.4
cyborg ISM and with that cyborg ISM

2980.5 --> 2991.15
artificial intelligence also will be

2983.4 --> 2994.15
introduced no because yeah people may at

2991.15 --> 2996.67
some point even be easily seduced as

2994.15 --> 2999.4
youngsters to have like intelligence

2996.67 --> 3003.75
enhancing chips when they are like total

2999.4 --> 3005.76
dumbasses and maybe it will do a lot but

3003.75 --> 3012.98
you can't really predict what comes out

3005.76 --> 3016.23
of that but it's all just the side works

3012.98 --> 3023.789
it's there they are partly promoting

3016.23 --> 3026.309
that and you can also see that even in

3023.789 --> 3029.789
the yeah well the developments in for

3026.309 --> 3034.17
example the Star Trek franchise remember

3029.789 --> 3038.099
how basic it was and like okay you have

3034.17 --> 3041.069
aliens and a uniform and just like a

3038.099 --> 3044.369
unit you kind of innocent UN approach

3041.069 --> 3047.549
still back then and then it starts to

3044.369 --> 3050.339
migrate more and more and now in the

3047.549 --> 3052.529
most reason it's just yeah you got a

3050.339 --> 3056.9
force in this next generation you got

3052.529 --> 3059.7
data the robot that is an emulated

3056.9 --> 3061.77
human-like way that's very interesting

3059.7 --> 3064.5
I'd love that character I really and

3061.77 --> 3065.69
they really made him excellent they made

3064.5 --> 3068.88
him to be loved

3065.69 --> 3072.779
for what he can do and I really liked

3068.88 --> 3075.63
that character but they kept on

3072.779 --> 3078.049
migrating and migrating more and I can

3075.63 --> 3082.829
start drug discovery there's like

3078.049 --> 3085.079
partial cyborgs and [ __ ] people that

3082.829 --> 3089.01
have like artificial intelligences and

3085.079 --> 3090.69
it's weird I didn't like it at all I

3089.01 --> 3094.4700000000003
thought it was like

3090.69 --> 3100.65
that's but it's definitely an attempt to

3094.47 --> 3109.7599999999998
kind of normalize oh you call it yeah

3100.65 --> 3109.76
cyborg ism of course in general

3138.89 --> 3142.5699999999997
okay that was my dad

3146.16 --> 3149.7
but yeah

3160.17 --> 3167.4
ah I lost my train of thought I was

3162.72 --> 3170.7
talking about cyborgs ISM it's just a

3167.4 --> 3173.58
name improvising look I'm having

3170.7 --> 3175.2
somewhat trouble with my vocabulary

3173.58 --> 3177.21
maybe it's because I'm still not

3175.2 --> 3180.4399999999996
completely healed on stealing laughing

3177.21 --> 3180.44
like benefi headache

3189.75 --> 3192.32
what

3201.83 --> 3207.67
right it's going to be complete fiction

3204.89 --> 3207.67
all of it

3225.51 --> 3231.23
no that's ridiculous

3231.94 --> 3245.349
because are you implying gravity that's

3238.569 --> 3247.42
that's hilarious Kailyn but no no gas

3245.349 --> 3252.28
pressure absolutely expands in all

3247.42 --> 3255.15
directions and there's no real force or

3252.28 --> 3259.0
anything that really can oppose it

3255.15 --> 3260.65
because gas pressure expansion is within

3259.0 --> 3263.23
a container is considered one of the

3260.65 --> 3268.9500000000003
most one of the strongest types of

3263.23 --> 3268.95
forces it's classified under entropy

3284.56 --> 3287.13
what

3298.95 --> 3306.3289999999997
that yeah you're saying that entropy can

3303.9 --> 3308.73
be both positive and negative but that

3306.329 --> 3312.51
doesn't make any damn sense why you're

3308.73 --> 3316.04
just saying that based on what what is

3312.51 --> 3318.809
your example that's ridiculous

3316.04 --> 3321.72
entropy works as it works as it always

3318.809 --> 3331.26
works there's nothing to counteract it

3321.72 --> 3335.73
really you might slow down certain types

3331.26 --> 3346.079
of this version but not really not in

3335.73 --> 3348.349
the end yeah learn watch get out you

3346.079 --> 3348.349
idiot

3357.14 --> 3364.93
gas pressure is different from

3359.599 --> 3364.9300000000003
atmospheric pressure no no it's not

3391.54 --> 3399.2799999999997
I have no idea what you're talking about

3394.54 --> 3403.72
Kalin but magnetic attraction dot does

3399.28 --> 3406.9500000000003
not overcome entropy that's ridiculous

3403.72 --> 3406.95
it doesn't

3420.82 --> 3426.0
no : Upton physics is not pseudoscience

3452.16 --> 3459.54
oh really no I'm pretty sure it does I'm

3456.75 --> 3463.62
pretty sure that magnetic energy is

3459.54 --> 3466.47
energy buddy and now where that energy

3463.62 --> 3471.3199999999997
comes from yeah that's another matter

3466.47 --> 3475.02
but its energy it's this is ridiculous

3471.32 --> 3477.75
do you well you seem to know very little

3475.02 --> 3484.14
about physics seems like you're

3477.75 --> 3490.65
improvising and not having proper

3484.14 --> 3494.37
practice at it and I'm improvising here

3490.65 --> 3496.14
with the freakin headache that's not bad

3494.37 --> 3501.47
but is getting in the way of my

3496.14 --> 3501.47
concentration yeah

3526.1 --> 3532.2799999999997
oh yeah look if you're gonna have a name

3529.58 --> 3538.0099999999998
like that in the first place it's just

3532.28 --> 3540.59
you and you're obviously a liar because

3538.01 --> 3545.7700000000004
you're already suggesting you might have

3540.59 --> 3545.77
take the photograph myself so no I

3561.27 --> 3569.22
hey Tom Parker you won the lotto yet or

3566.34 --> 3571.82
you're running for president yet kind of

3569.22 --> 3571.8199999999997
question is that

3576.89 --> 3582.7
you think I wouldn't tell if I did she's

3598.04 --> 3600.82
hmm

3604.91 --> 3612.019
yeah well Sandra woods I wonder though

3607.609 --> 3614.5389999999998
what he exactly saw as this because I

3612.019 --> 3623.359
imagine that he did he would see a desk

3614.539 --> 3626.15
but did he see the disc orientation of

3623.359 --> 3633.589
the earth was he there or did he only

3626.15 --> 3636.64
see the continent of where he was where

3633.589 --> 3640.88
he ascended I don't exactly remember

3636.64 --> 3643.49
what he exactly said he saw I think I

3640.88 --> 3648.6400000000003
only remember that the description of

3643.49 --> 3648.64
how it looked like the whole thing

3665.47 --> 3670.0499999999997
they don't call it upton they assume it

3670.619 --> 3673.92
presuppose it

3680.12 --> 3687.92
yeah but you have no proof it's a circle

3683.0 --> 3689.99
either YouTube so yeah all of the circle

3687.92 --> 3693.9500000000003
is all presupposed I'd like to see some

3689.99 --> 3696.2
actual data about the orientation of the

3693.95 --> 3704.12
equator line okay and then we'll talk

3696.2 --> 3706.5699999999997
about circle or disks or whatever right

3704.12 --> 3706.5699999999997
Zep tepi

3712.36 --> 3719.6800000000003
yeah oh yeah John Watson well picard was

3716.56 --> 3721.89
definitely right about that I have no

3719.68 --> 3721.89
doubt

3741.22 --> 3747.5789999999997
alright Billy Sunday that's why I say I

3744.069 --> 3750.3
haven't heard and he claims about him

3747.579 --> 3753.9100000000003
claiming to have seen all the continents

3750.3 --> 3758.829
or anything in that direction so I don't

3753.91 --> 3762.52
think I think that this is kind of like

3758.829 --> 3766.6600000000003
more disco desperation it's just that

3762.52 --> 3769.54
habit you know the worst thing the ball

3766.66 --> 3771.94
the ball religion has ever done for

3769.54 --> 3777.18
people that believe it is make them

3771.94 --> 3779.7400000000002
dependent like maniacally dependent on

3777.18 --> 3784.72
having the feeling that they know

3779.74 --> 3788.14
everything and this doesn't just end

3784.72 --> 3789.91
when you stop yeah when you stop

3788.14 --> 3794.02
believing in the ball because this

3789.91 --> 3796.72
tendency just makes you this side like

3794.02 --> 3799.569
this is what it makes you propagandize

3796.72 --> 3802.6299999999997
because you become fanatical which is

3799.569 --> 3805.9
what exactly that thing does that

3802.63 --> 3813.73
dependency on having to know everything

3805.9 --> 3817.23
you don't you never will so it's much

3813.73 --> 3820.23
better to just be freaking honest and

3817.23 --> 3820.23
minimalist

3824.77 --> 3827.77
hmm

3854.27 --> 3859.21
no but that's where you're wrong cept a

3857.0 --> 3859.21
pea

3868.52 --> 3876.16
if you really want to know you're gonna

3871.13 --> 3879.83
have to prove it yourself and bypass

3876.16 --> 3883.0299999999997
psychological traps as you do it got to

3879.83 --> 3885.17
be absolutely mercilessly empirical and

3883.03 --> 3888.23
ballers can do it they've been

3885.17 --> 3891.76
indoctrinated to specifically bypass it

3888.23 --> 3894.65
they can't do it it's like impossible

3891.76 --> 3897.2900000000004
you got it you got a principals you got

3894.65 --> 3900.9500000000003
to get it you got to even visualize it

3897.29 --> 3904.79
in your mind to adapt to what you

3900.95 --> 3909.95
believe that's a big problem so I don't

3904.79 --> 3913.16
trust anyone really I I trust people to

3909.95 --> 3915.77
give good sources and then I'll look

3913.16 --> 3919.49
into the sources and then I will

3915.77 --> 3922.58
determine whether that source is

3919.49 --> 3927.41
reliable and to what degree and what I

3922.58 --> 3935.2
can take from it but I don't take

3927.41 --> 3935.2
anyone's words I want to see it

3979.16 --> 3985.85
all right yeah well good luck with that

3982.43 --> 3988.1299999999997
cept a fee because a large preponderance

3985.85 --> 3992.17
of the knowledge on the baller side is

3988.13 --> 3995.05
made specifically by extremely devious

3992.17 --> 3998.7200000000003
very determined liars

3995.05 --> 4001.9300000000003
so yeah you will never escape from them

3998.72 --> 4003.97
if you believe the earth is a ball you

4001.93 --> 4006.75
will never escape from them okay

4003.97 --> 4009.3399999999997
they will have their influence on you

4006.75 --> 4012.46
because they are the only ones that

4009.34 --> 4017.13
supposedly even thread it this far into

4012.46 --> 4020.98
the knowledge of the globe you know it

4017.13 --> 4023.9700000000003
astrophysics is just all all of it it's

4020.98 --> 4023.97
all a priesthood

4040.14 --> 4048.0
I think it does Zep tepi because i think

4043.77 --> 4049.56
that you see the ball everywhere so yeah

4048.0 --> 4052.47
the shape of the earth does have an

4049.56 --> 4054.69
impact on you because how matter how you

4052.47 --> 4057.33
see you're being confronted with a shape

4054.69 --> 4060.36
of earth constantly and happens to be

4057.33 --> 4062.31
the ball which is a lie and yeah you

4060.36 --> 4065.1
know about constantly having a lie

4062.31 --> 4068.07
shoved in your face perpetually

4065.1 --> 4071.31
constantly in and out every day almost

4068.07 --> 4074.04
and not knowing it is a lie thinking

4071.31 --> 4077.19
that is real do you know what that does

4074.04 --> 4086.58
to you psychologically spiritually to

4077.19 --> 4088.5
your soul overtime it corrupts you one

4086.58 --> 4094.97
of the most subtle corruptions there is

4088.5 --> 4094.97
and it degrades you breaks you down

4099.589 --> 4105.58
okay is that Tapio that's fine that's

4102.98 --> 4105.58
something

4108.74 --> 4111.79
[Music]

4120.109 --> 4124.67
all right well colin upton those things

4122.99 --> 4127.79
that you are talking about right there

4124.67 --> 4129.95
are all based on assumptions a lot of

4127.79 --> 4132.17
assumptions is based on disk assumption

4129.95 --> 4137.0
based on dome assumption and based on

4132.17 --> 4138.65
star literal position assumptions and i

4137.0 --> 4140.66
think those are all false assumptions

4138.65 --> 4145.389999999999
all of them because there's definitely

4140.66 --> 4148.28
an enclosure there's definitely a a

4145.39 --> 4152.450000000001
container some kind it is contained the

4148.28 --> 4156.62
realm is contained can't be so big as

4152.45 --> 4159.0199999999995
big as the universe presuppose it is in

4156.62 --> 4162.17
order for well everything to be as it is

4159.02 --> 4163.55
here so it is a container of some kind

4162.17 --> 4165.38
but we don't know if it's a dome and we

4163.55 --> 4174.47
don't even know the orientation of the

4165.38 --> 4176.54
equator and then there's yet the star

4174.47 --> 4177.05
the issue with the Stars and the Sun and

4176.54 --> 4181.25
the moon

4177.05 --> 4183.41
well everybody so both disk are still

4181.25 --> 4190.24
this is the problem also with the disk

4183.41 --> 4190.24
is they're basically substituting the

4190.3 --> 4197.18
the wide-reaching the more wide-reaching

4193.64 --> 4199.76
globe imaginations of what these lights

4197.18 --> 4201.83
in the sky are which are supposedly huge

4199.76 --> 4206.8
balls as big as the earth out there and

4201.83 --> 4209.39
stars it lights fire balls all that and

4206.8 --> 4211.58
replacing them with more local lights

4209.39 --> 4215.87
but that are supposedly still going to

4211.58 --> 4218.45
be in exact presupposed locations and

4215.87 --> 4221.0
that is still kind of like a physicality

4218.45 --> 4224.139999999999
assumption bias even though the stars

4221.0 --> 4226.31
are just little lights in that

4224.14 --> 4230.5
conceptualization but the Sun and the

4226.31 --> 4230.5
moon aren't directly

4234.76 --> 4241.5
all these lights all the heavenly lights

4237.31 --> 4247.6
they just adhere to things that can

4241.5 --> 4252.58
receive light and then transform that

4247.6 --> 4257.530000000001
into information optics eyes cameras all

4252.58 --> 4260.82
things that are optical see it and they

4257.53 --> 4264.09
always relate to the observer

4260.82 --> 4267.37
specifically as Adam I go around them

4264.09 --> 4273.7300000000005
specific relations to their position on

4267.37 --> 4275.95
the on the earth realm and it is one of

4273.73 --> 4280.12
the most specific orientations that we

4275.95 --> 4283.62
know we based the entire equator and map

4280.12 --> 4287.099999999999
grading on the celestial behavior

4283.62 --> 4287.099999999999
specifically the Sun

4313.15 --> 4323.21
: Upton ie sure but the thing about it

4319.19 --> 4326.08
is that nobody is seeing the same moon

4323.21 --> 4329.3
or the same Sun because all of these

4326.08 --> 4331.28
apparitions these lights are all very

4329.3 --> 4333.349
specific in relation to the observer

4331.28 --> 4336.639
they will appear in their specific

4333.349 --> 4340.67
orientation in relation to the observers

4336.639 --> 4343.79
location and they're all light phenomena

4340.67 --> 4345.11
like holographic projections and that

4343.79 --> 4350.21
makes it some kind of complicated

4345.11 --> 4353.36
because it radiates a lot of light but

4350.21 --> 4357.949
nobody is seeing the same thing it's not

4353.36 --> 4362.32
a thing you're looking at it's a light

4357.949 --> 4362.32
in a certain set of

4373.94 --> 4378.139999999999
all right anyway I'm gonna round out the

4376.25 --> 4381.14
show because yeah I'm gonna be picked up

4378.14 --> 4383.360000000001

studio 68 I'll be back tomorrow with

4407.12 --> 4418.099999999999

4410.57 --> 4421.58
so the 300 0ver hmm I should tag me

4418.1 --> 4422.38
found indeed over Mukul so yeah Merry

2nd day of Christmas everyone and yeah

4427.61 --> 4432.889999999999
there's a flat earth debate re-run thing

4429.77 --> 4434.900000000001
going so you can look at that or spend

4432.89 --> 4438.1900000000005
