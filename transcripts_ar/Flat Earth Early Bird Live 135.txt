38.48 --> 46.98
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.78 --> 55.92
early-bird number 135 I'm your host

46.98 --> 60.059
Arwen and today it's not so sunny but

55.92 --> 63.18
yeah it's kind of nice and warm our

60.059 --> 71.91
average temperature cloudy here and

63.18 --> 74.09
there but it's okay so you guys all

71.91 --> 74.09
doing

79.92 --> 93.96000000000001
Jassa Conda and Chad

83.43 --> 96.10000000000001
Laurel G L Jewish are huge

93.96 --> 101.46
Hewitt's right

96.1 --> 109.29899999999999
is that it Laurel G L youit's anyway

101.46 --> 123.27
hello bill G [ __ ] yous DJ Adagio good to

109.299 --> 129.53900000000002
see you guys see what happened yesterday

123.27 --> 129.539
let me remind myself

133.51 --> 141.89999999999998
oh yeah that was better globe busters

136.769 --> 147.87900000000002
was kind of interesting yesterday and oh

141.9 --> 152.37900000000002
yeah there was a horror sheet show with

147.879 --> 154.32999999999998
GM truth TV it was it was funny it was

152.379 --> 156.849
kind of good yeah I've seen the guy

154.33 --> 158.59
before I think he even went on Patricius

156.849 --> 160.39
or something or I saw him somewhere else

158.59 --> 167.11
I don't know I don't remember where it

160.39 --> 169.67999999999998
was but yeah that was kind of fun and

167.11 --> 169.68
interesting

170.489 --> 191.68
hello chocolate saying Karen B I should

189.04 --> 199.66
start keeping notes these days because

191.68 --> 207.31
my I'm just too distracted on average to

199.66 --> 210.91
keep a clear overview in that sense my

207.31 --> 214.72
cognitive abilities and my focus is not

210.91 --> 215.819
that good currently but it'll get better

214.72 --> 220.81
I'm pretty sure of it

215.819 --> 226.03
although the shadow captain' but yeah

220.81 --> 228.609
that was kind of interesting I'm

226.03 --> 231.519
basically digging for new inspiration

228.609 --> 235.299
for new interesting timid material to

231.519 --> 238.769
focus on and I got myself on the back

235.299 --> 243.76000000000002
panel of Jose's hangout yesterday

238.769 --> 249.04000000000002
pretty much was going even during my

243.76 --> 251.29
show trying to compete with me but yeah

249.04 --> 254.85899999999998
I didn't get on this live show I think

251.29 --> 258.15999999999997
but afterwards yeah there was a panel

254.859 --> 261.729
full of ballers i completely filled up

258.16 --> 265.43
with ballers i got in there it was also

261.729 --> 268.88
jose is using another type of

265.43 --> 271.639
panel it's like the other type of Google

268.88 --> 273.919
Hangouts panel thing where you doubt

271.639 --> 275.539
where you don't have the ability to get

273.919 --> 279.13
in the back chat I think I'm not

275.539 --> 283.18
entirely sure it works differently and

279.13 --> 287.57
yeah didn't have any trouble basically

283.18 --> 289.639
getting sound from other people so that

287.57 --> 293.09
type of panel seems to be working I need

289.639 --> 295.28000000000003
to figure out how to work this and then

293.09 --> 298.58
if I use that type of Google Hangouts

295.28 --> 302.539
panel then I might still be able to

298.58 --> 305.0
continue using Google Hangouts instead

302.539 --> 309.02
of computer relying on skype but anyway

305.0 --> 312.699
I was in there and yeah I got the usual

309.02 --> 312.69899999999996
baller crap

312.91 --> 319.76000000000005
seriously they're like Tommy was in

315.5 --> 321.919
their rumpus George Netanyahu curved

319.76 --> 324.08
water it was full of pretty nasty

321.919 --> 326.24
figures and they were all calling me

324.08 --> 329.9
stupid and [ __ ] and I eventually

326.24 --> 332.3
started ignoring that and just kind of

329.9 --> 339.25
using the situation with all these

332.3 --> 344.26
ballers and their wider view on

339.25 --> 348.11
statistics and things to basically ask

344.26 --> 350.539
ya about about certain knowledge --is

348.11 --> 353.27000000000004
that they of course use for massive

350.539 --> 357.349
presuppositional reasoning but still it

353.27 --> 364.599
was interesting and and we was again

357.349 --> 367.28
yeah the cesium clock came up like and I

364.599 --> 369.83
had the funny thing was like 20 years

367.28 --> 372.19899999999996
ago this also came up but it never

369.83 --> 374.99
really stuck to much so they basically

372.199 --> 376.97
reminded me about old knowledge and how

374.99 --> 380.74
the cesium clock is completely

376.97 --> 384.03900000000004
unaffected by any type of forces really

380.74 --> 388.37
doesn't need to be reset like scales

384.039 --> 391.039
whenever you change something and some

388.37 --> 393.77
yeah there was some detail about it it

391.039 --> 396.169
was weird I don't know how to interpret

393.77 --> 398.53999999999996
it just yet but it's kind of another

396.169 --> 401.03
interesting factoid about

398.54 --> 404.39000000000004
of this world seems to work and that is

401.03 --> 408.26
that aside from their assumption that of

404.39 --> 411.43
course on the ISS they have this cesium

408.26 --> 416.12
clock and in satellites they use it in

411.43 --> 422.3
but the thing was that apparently the

416.12 --> 427.79
cesium clock registers a different speed

422.3 --> 431.06
of time and the higher you go up the

427.79 --> 432.68
more time seems to speed up and are they

431.06 --> 437.15
say oh it's because of the lack of

432.68 --> 440.48
gravity oh and by the way the amount

437.15 --> 443.45
that the clock seems to differentiate

440.48 --> 448.40000000000003
even though persistent apparently is so

443.45 --> 450.86
incredibly low that if I remember this

448.4 --> 453.40999999999997
correctly they said that on the ISS on

450.86 --> 459.5
that distance supposedly there's like a

453.41 --> 462.77000000000004
one millionth of a second difference or

459.5 --> 464.72
something it was incredibly low so I

462.77 --> 469.76
immediately said yeah that's kind of

464.72 --> 475.66
insignificant but since these clocks are

469.76 --> 477.89
so incredibly accurate the this type of

475.66 --> 481.13000000000005
deviations in time

477.89 --> 484.90999999999997
sensing seems to be pretty persistent so

481.13 --> 485.74
they claim so I was thinking yeah it's

484.91 --> 493.25
pretty interesting

485.74 --> 495.8
just as data that okay this separate

493.25 --> 498.37
device that's really not influenced

495.8 --> 503.24
because it's based on radioactivity can

498.37 --> 506.75
measure a slight time difference as yeah

503.24 --> 508.85
as you go up so I asked them yeah has

506.75 --> 511.55
this thing ever been taken down really

508.85 --> 515.86
deep what's the the greatest depth this

511.55 --> 520.49
clock has been taken and was there a

515.86 --> 522.65
slowdown a slowdown actually off time

520.49 --> 524.87
and they didn't really have a clear

522.65 --> 528.98
straightforward answers we're not

524.87 --> 531.649
answering Opie Diaz and what it is kind

528.98 --> 533.629
of interesting to me because yeah

531.649 --> 535.369
if that is there then they of course

533.629 --> 541.6700000000001
will assume is because of gravity and

535.369 --> 545.6600000000001
Einstein in logic but taken that aside

541.67 --> 549.709
if this is happening if this is another

545.66 --> 551.929
factor another registered measured data

549.709 --> 554.149
as it were just like the angular

551.929 --> 555.529
relations of the heavenly bodies in in

554.149 --> 559.309
relation to the position of the earth

555.529 --> 561.74
you got some new raw data that could

559.309 --> 563.8389999999999
point to a lot of things a lot of

561.74 --> 565.73
different things it's part of the

563.839 --> 571.4200000000001
setting of this world apparently and I'm

565.73 --> 574.6700000000001
just curious like why what's behind this

571.42 --> 579.199
because I think that the gravity concept

574.67 --> 582.259
is wildly elaborate and yeah not really

579.199 --> 584.569
a good solution as to why this time

582.259 --> 586.999
differential is happening so

584.569 --> 587.509
persistently so what is going on there

586.999 --> 589.279
and I just

587.509 --> 593.9590000000001
even suggest that could it be that

589.279 --> 597.949
because of some high electrical field up

593.959 --> 601.279
there that perhaps this cesium clock

597.949 --> 603.4699999999999
could or the radioactive material of

601.279 --> 606.769
cesium would be influenced by some kind

603.47 --> 608.6
of high static fields but they said no

606.769 --> 610.79
that's not possible it's completely

608.6 --> 616.97
uninfluenced by any kind of electrical

610.79 --> 621.319
field passing through it or anything but

616.97 --> 624.279
yeah I don't know they were I was really

621.319 --> 626.54
like testing them as as like a student

624.279 --> 628.879
something I typically likes to just keep

626.54 --> 630.8
on asking really complex questions and

628.879 --> 632.87
really test the limits of their

630.8 --> 636.439
knowledge and not their assumptions but

632.87 --> 639.069
of their knowledge and I think that they

636.439 --> 642.92
eventually they they kind of lost track

639.069 --> 644.809
but yeah it is interesting if is that

642.92 --> 647.8389999999999
really going on is there a time

644.809 --> 650.209
differential however slight and what

647.839 --> 652.6
causes that what could potentially cause

650.209 --> 657.67
that so yeah

652.6 --> 659.86
I got a little inspired a Hello sleeping

657.67 --> 662.76
warrior yeah you were on there as well I

659.86 --> 665.77
thought you were doing an incredible job

662.76 --> 668.68
considering the circumstances so well

665.77 --> 674.02
done to that it did get a bit messy but

668.68 --> 678.39
ya can't blame me there they just they

674.02 --> 678.39
yeah combined trumpeting forces you know

678.63 --> 686.4
right

679.87 --> 691.57
well flatlander look time is measured by

686.4 --> 693.79
the stability of change you could say

691.57 --> 698.98
that time it can be measured by

693.79 --> 702.8499999999999
deduction of entropy constant and well

698.98 --> 708.28
if radioactivity is not influenced in

702.85 --> 711.58
any way by any other force or a yeah

708.28 --> 717.01
influence then well maybe

711.58 --> 720.22
time does actually change vertically

717.01 --> 725.8199999999999
over this and somehow because that's

720.22 --> 725.82
measured so yeah I don't know

729.69 --> 737.72
maybe they had the way time is

733.1 --> 737.72
experienced on the earth is different

745.519 --> 753.92
maybe as you go down time slows down and

748.939 --> 760.279
as you go up time speeds up however

753.92 --> 764.269
little it yeah relatively if you don't

760.279 --> 766.279
start assuming the a fast universe of

764.269 --> 767.99
outer space then there's not so much

766.279 --> 770.0889999999999
distance we could even take from the

767.99 --> 774.139
earth but the distance apparently that

770.089 --> 776.8290000000001
we can yeah slight time differences are

774.139 --> 776.8290000000001
being measured

783.23 --> 786.01
all right

786.73 --> 797.44
it would be interesting to try and

789.19 --> 800.11
compare yeah an actual chemical clock

797.44 --> 801.7600000000001
with expir the experience of time itself

800.11 --> 806.14
but the problem is that the clock is

801.76 --> 808.5699999999999
just showing such a minut yeah it's in

806.14 --> 812.68
significant deviation that yeah how

808.57 --> 815.97
could you even pick that up as an

812.68 --> 818.17
experience of time when we

815.97 --> 822.25
psychologically already have so many

818.17 --> 825.7299999999999
natural deviations in how we experience

822.25 --> 834.28
time just by our mood and by our focus

825.73 --> 843.3100000000001
so as a technical as a technicality I

834.28 --> 847.41
find it kind of interesting yeah I

843.31 --> 850.15
mostly just try to gather data and

847.41 --> 855.91
completely without presuppositions and

850.15 --> 859.06
just have like a big bag big bucket of

855.91 --> 863.0699999999999
Legos of raw data of just things that

859.06 --> 866.1099999999999
just so happened to be here and then not

863.07 --> 868.72
dying all the explanations given but

866.11 --> 871.1800000000001
just as raw data and then try to figure

868.72 --> 873.9100000000001
things out with that including that

871.18 --> 876.5799999999999
reflecting everything that I try to

873.91 --> 881.1
build in some kind of model concept to

876.58 --> 881.1
all dot all that rough data somehow

887.85 --> 905.3100000000001
anyway oh go Tim's roll into music of

896.68 --> 905.31
all four in each cute

907.7 --> 911.23
Juan Carlos

916.81 --> 925.4799999999999
yeah anyway yeah that was just a snippet

921.31 --> 928.9
of new data that caught my interest have

925.48 --> 930.79
to say that other than that don't get

928.9 --> 934.66
the feeling there's a lot of like really

930.79 --> 938.53
interesting new data coming out it's

934.66 --> 943.86
almost funny because the ballers are so

938.53 --> 946.72
busy always trying to find more proof

943.86 --> 950.35
that their presuppositions are worth

946.72 --> 954.9
presupposing reflecting upon all kinds

950.35 --> 959.26
of just data that have been used to

954.9 --> 963.1899999999999
reinforce the the ghost armor of gravity

959.26 --> 966.7
for one of the aberration of gravity all

963.19 --> 971.0500000000001
kinds of things were just raw data that

966.7 --> 972.94
has been done for we have likely for

971.05 --> 975.76
devious purposes just to help the

972.94 --> 977.5
presupposition and everything they have

975.76 --> 980.74
gathered this data and it's kind of

977.5 --> 983.91
interesting to just look at it even

980.74 --> 986.59
though they originally conjured it for

983.91 --> 988.6899999999999
malicious purposes you could say from a

986.59 --> 991.1800000000001
flat earther perspective it is still

988.69 --> 995.2600000000001
data and I just wonder like how much of

991.18 --> 999.9699999999999
this data do they have and maybe yeah we

995.26 --> 1003.54
can learn more about just the data of

999.97 --> 1006.83
this world how it works to try and do

1003.54 --> 1006.8299999999999
something with I don't know

1015.139 --> 1019.04
hello rentee flutters

1023.329 --> 1032.9489999999998
Oh God

1039.16 --> 1042.3490000000002
[Music]

1064.11 --> 1067.31
[Music]

1095.78 --> 1101.21
so Nathan you're going to start up a

1098.25 --> 1101.21
debate again today

1111.73 --> 1120.28
why are you asking Juan Carlos

1117.09 --> 1120.28
[Music]

1134.89 --> 1144.45
hello that one guy got CU and

1139.63 --> 1144.45
truth-seeker mafia Daniel

1164.48 --> 1170.63
yeah was kind of surprised Nathan there

1167.1 --> 1170.6299999999999
was no bull buses yesterday

1187.62 --> 1195.6589999999999
I would like to have the opportunity at

1190.83 --> 1200.61
some point alright don't want to compete

1195.659 --> 1201.5390000000002
with globe busters okay that's right you

1200.61 --> 1204.8999999999999
do it on Saturday

1201.539 --> 1208.669
good okay I'll try to remember but yeah

1204.9 --> 1212.25
I would love to be part of these shows

1208.669 --> 1214.74
just like on the back burner or as soon

1212.25 --> 1217.83
as people start to go on about gravity

1214.74 --> 1220.95
then else I'll do my thing and get in

1217.83 --> 1225.6
the way start talking about aberrations

1220.95 --> 1229.26
and how it's not very wise to just

1225.6 --> 1234.2099999999998
outright ignore and try to erase gravity

1229.26 --> 1247.559
from everything but yeah I'll have to

1234.21 --> 1251.63
wait till Saturday no Daniel gravity is

1247.559 --> 1251.6299999999999
not a natural law like entropy

1255.8 --> 1264.48
gravity is a deduced concept based on

1260.22 --> 1266.94
several observations and make it highly

1264.48 --> 1269.85
suggestive for there to be a force this

1266.94 --> 1273.3300000000002
equilibrium present at all time as a

1269.85 --> 1278.58
constant but that's yeah it's an

1273.33 --> 1283.1999999999998
aberration it's not a natural law it's

1278.58 --> 1290.01
you could say it's a natural deducible

1283.2 --> 1293.13
anomaly now what an entropy is not a

1290.01 --> 1297.24
widely deducible anomaly because it is

1293.13 --> 1301.3200000000002
truly ever-present it's a part of the

1297.24 --> 1305.88
fabric of how things work that makes it

1301.32 --> 1308.6399999999999
a real law because yeah you can you

1305.88 --> 1311.24
can't really disprove it well with

1308.64 --> 1314.3400000000001
gravity you can you can very easily

1311.24 --> 1317.33
replace it by system that can actually

1314.34 --> 1321.47
be scientifically proven and that's

1317.33 --> 1321.47
that's why it's not a law

1327.7 --> 1334.49
I'm very sad to see the ballers like

1331.179 --> 1339.259
doubling down and piling on the mistakes

1334.49 --> 1341.72
concerning gravity be so much better if

1339.259 --> 1343.97
you just look into the Orwellian

1341.72 --> 1347.529
perspective on gravity and figure out

1343.97 --> 1347.529
what it is and what it is not

1359.55 --> 1363.119
[Music]

1375.38 --> 1380.18
where's dank I didn't see dank in chat

1391.89 --> 1396.43
Nathan where do you see dank in chat I

1395.29 --> 1418.09
don't see him anywhere

1396.43 --> 1423.0600000000002
oh you are I didn't know that okay so

1418.09 --> 1423.06
[ __ ] uses formerly known as dank I guess

1437.7 --> 1442.95
that that's an odd question Sabrina

1440.13 --> 1445.0200000000002
browning how come sometimes in the

1442.95 --> 1448.1100000000001
distance it looks like planes are

1445.02 --> 1449.85
travelling straight up and down I I

1448.11 --> 1452.51
don't recalling having ever seen

1449.85 --> 1452.51
anything like that

1463.77 --> 1473.309
usually when I see planes I just yeah

1467.07 --> 1479.85
just see them folding into the horizon

1473.309 --> 1482.97
until they become obstructed so yeah

1479.85 --> 1485.49
higher above us they seem to go more

1482.97 --> 1488.82
straight down and then state approach

1485.49 --> 1491.94
the horizon they just start to go more

1488.82 --> 1493.35
horizon or a horizontal even though they

1491.94 --> 1496.3500000000001
are technically going in a straight line

1493.35 --> 1500.58
so I don't really never really see them

1496.35 --> 1502.9189999999999
go bending down and in the far distance

1500.58 --> 1504.539
I don't know why yeah why you claim

1502.919 --> 1515.8200000000002
you've seen that I've never seen

1504.539 --> 1518.9089999999999
anything like that right yep

1515.82 --> 1522.029
yeah Nathan's right mass attracting mass

1518.909 --> 1528.98
that's that's a myth that that's a fairy

1522.029 --> 1534.72
tale that the mutation of the original

1528.98 --> 1539.549
gravity anomaly the aberration its

1534.72 --> 1543.39
grafted on assumption to turn it into

1539.549 --> 1547.1399999999999
global or but that it doesn't exist it

1543.39 --> 1550.19
yeah what whatever causes the apparent

1547.14 --> 1556.1000000000001
force this equilibrium apparent I say

1550.19 --> 1556.1000000000001
it's not mass attracting other mass

1589.99 --> 1593.19
[Music]

1594.13 --> 1603.6100000000001
right and the funny thing is about the

1601.75 --> 1608.32
apparent force disequilibrium is that

1603.61 --> 1610.36
yeah it always applies to mass that is

1608.32 --> 1614.3799999999999
what is susceptible to the apparent

1610.36 --> 1616.51
force disequilibrium or you could simply

1614.38 --> 1620.1100000000001
explain it by relative density which

1616.51 --> 1624.44
functions much more scientifically but

1620.11 --> 1625.83
that doesn't mean that that inherently

1624.44 --> 1629.559
[Music]

1625.83 --> 1633.6399999999999
proves that that is the cost that mass

1629.559 --> 1637.75
actually causes this apparent force

1633.64 --> 1642.0300000000002
disequilibrium at all it is merely the

1637.75 --> 1645.36
mass is the recipient of this effect

1642.03 --> 1645.36
that is all

1670.73 --> 1678.54
stop being stubborn dumbass Daniel it

1674.16 --> 1683.99
does work just his outright declaration

1678.54 --> 1683.99
that it doesn't that's called denial

1684.62 --> 1692.4499999999998
it's an emotional response it does work

1717.47 --> 1724.16
right Daniel well the thing is it's not

1720.48 --> 1731.91
about force it's only about the relative

1724.16 --> 1734.5500000000002
about the displacements and I don't know

1731.91 --> 1737.6100000000001
if the necessary antecedent for

1734.55 --> 1739.8899999999999
displacement is a force I don't know if

1737.61 --> 1749.84
that's a true statement I'm pretty sure

1739.89 --> 1756.0300000000002
it doesn't it's not the relative density

1749.84 --> 1758.1599999999999
simply describes how the motion is

1756.03 --> 1761.36
coming into being and that's what it's

1758.16 --> 1764.99
about it's about proving the cause and

1761.36 --> 1764.99
it does work

1784.4 --> 1793.419
look Daniel why wouldn't an object fall

1787.909 --> 1795.919
in a vacuum why wouldn't it it's

1793.419 --> 1802.279
relative density compared to its

1795.919 --> 1806.179
surroundings is still the same a vacuum

1802.279 --> 1810.49
chamber is also part of this world even

1806.179 --> 1815.8090000000002
though there's no gas no air friction to

1810.49 --> 1817.7
prohibit the speed of the falling but

1815.809 --> 1819.47
still relative density at work doesn't

1817.7 --> 1821.5900000000001
matter if there's a vacuum surrounding

1819.47 --> 1821.59
it

1836.09 --> 1845.8999999999999
I've never heard of electrons being

1839.9 --> 1849.95
susceptible to so any kind of force is

1845.9 --> 1854.14
similar to to mass as far as I'm

1849.95 --> 1854.14
concerned electrons don't have any mass

1855.76 --> 1861.44
so it's a weird statement saying that

1858.97 --> 1872.68
electrons don't fall in a vacuum

1861.44 --> 1872.68
it's just weird now they don't Daniel

1878.75 --> 1883.069
[Music]

1888.62 --> 1894.8799999999999
[Music]

1904.24 --> 1910.18
I don't think electrons have mass or

1908.05 --> 1915.34
Negatron as they should be called

1910.18 --> 1919.21
actually and I don't think photons or

1915.34 --> 1921.61
light in general has mass even dispute

1919.21 --> 1926.02
if photons are actually particles at all

1921.61 --> 1929.6799999999998
and I could almost say the same thing

1926.02 --> 1933.25
for electrons is it really a particle or

1929.68 --> 1940.0600000000002
is it only an apparent particle when it

1933.25 --> 1944.19
is bound to protons and neutrons in the

1940.06 --> 1944.19
form of Mattia in the form of matter

1960.5 --> 1968.96
it's ridiculous it's ridiculous science

1963.14 --> 1974.39
fiction claims forced to accelerate

1968.96 --> 1978.89
electrons it's ridiculous you should

1974.39 --> 1983.24
know better like electricity forces

1978.89 --> 1986.0800000000002
don't influence electrons basically it

1983.24 --> 1986.08
doesn't at all

1994.7 --> 2000.8500000000001
right yeah you can accelerate electrons

1997.759 --> 2007.21
in a particle accelerator because it's

2000.85 --> 2011.7099999999998
being pushed magnetically it's very

2007.21 --> 2014.98
specific there's no actual forces yeah

2011.71 --> 2019.21
except for magnetic influence and you

2014.98 --> 2022.539
look and a electrons are influenced by

2019.21 --> 2025.23
magnetism very obviously it's part of

2022.539 --> 2025.23
the effect

2034.87 --> 2043.4199999999998
all right well magnetism may be a force

2037.42 --> 2046.3000000000002
- ferrous metals and - electric things

2043.42 --> 2049.09
like even the electrons but it's very

2046.3 --> 2052.93
selective you can't just say it is a

2049.09 --> 2054.73
force just like like motion or

2052.93 --> 2057.58
displacement or anything else because it

2054.73 --> 2061.36
only exerts a force on very specific

2057.58 --> 2065.41
things it can only displace very

2061.36 --> 2068.88
specific things so just because

2065.41 --> 2071.44
magnetism influence an electron or

2068.88 --> 2075.9700000000003
anything in that direction does it mean

2071.44 --> 2078.64
that you can equate that to force in

2075.97 --> 2084.99
general the same force that applies to

2078.64 --> 2084.99
matter it's not the same thing

2085.989 --> 2094.429
[Music]

2097.31 --> 2103.39
[Music]

2114.29 --> 2121.25
right but the thing is you even assumed

2117.17 --> 2125.87
momentum you assumed literal speed I

2121.25 --> 2129.26
just say look an electron it's more like

2125.87 --> 2136.22
a separate separated electron is more

2129.26 --> 2139.4
like like a strand or a field

2136.22 --> 2143.6299999999997
part of a field and magnetically that

2139.4 --> 2162.38
could be enhanced but to say literal

2143.63 --> 2164.15
speed no do we measure it so how did you

2162.38 --> 2166.82
measure it did you put a camera on it

2164.15 --> 2169.94
and then have these lines of distance

2166.82 --> 2173.6600000000003
and then see how the particle moves over

2169.94 --> 2176.84
that that border so we can then deduce

2173.66 --> 2178.8799999999997
the speed because that specific particle

2176.84 --> 2183.3500000000004
was measured at this time at this

2178.88 --> 2187.06
specific distance really I highly doubt

2183.35 --> 2192.16
that that is how that worked because

2187.06 --> 2196.09
yeah if you could conjure up the actual

2192.16 --> 2196.0899999999997
observation of an electron

2200.12 --> 2206.16
hiren filings okay well then mass is

2203.28 --> 2209.0400000000004
involved if there's actual iron filings

2206.16 --> 2212.54
iron filings then there's math involved

2209.04 --> 2212.54
and not just electrons

2218.93 --> 2223.95
yeah with silicon this is a show where

2222.27 --> 2226.58
the host eats in front of you it's a

2223.95 --> 2226.58
breakfast show

2252.95 --> 2256.1099999999997
[Music]

2287.36 --> 2293.73
again you're simply assuming you're

2291.84 --> 2296.7000000000003
assuming electrons and then you're

2293.73 --> 2300.23
imagining the bumping of electrons these

2296.7 --> 2303.99
are all visualized conceptualizations of

2300.23 --> 2307.05
how the process dealing with these

2303.99 --> 2309.5099999999998
electrons is supposedly functioning but

2307.05 --> 2313.26
there's no empirical confirmation of any

2309.51 --> 2322.2900000000004
of it it's theorized that that is how it

2313.26 --> 2324.8100000000004
is through particle theory and yeah I

2322.29 --> 2327.849
say no no it's not particles

2324.81 --> 2327.849
[Music]

2344.96 --> 2354.079
right yeah well it is energy probably

2351.43 --> 2358.0099999999998
electrons are probably energy but to

2354.079 --> 2360.1090000000004
assume that it is a particle that is

2358.01 --> 2365.6800000000003
where the presuppositional thinking

2360.109 --> 2365.68
starts to set in with particle theory oh

2371.859 --> 2376.3089999999997
look at that

2373.52 --> 2378.349
well said Daniel without it you just

2376.309 --> 2380.8390000000004
have basic confirmation bias in a

2378.349 --> 2384.9700000000003
completely paradoxical packet paradigm

2380.839 --> 2388.69
that's right because that's what it is

2384.97 --> 2388.6899999999996
isn't that just amazing

2400.109 --> 2404.89
all right

2401.5 --> 2407.38
fear beliefs and particle theory falls

2404.89 --> 2411.75
under that same it's making everything

2407.38 --> 2415.9500000000003
into spheres or dots anything that is

2411.75 --> 2420.48
spherical basically miniature or grand

2415.95 --> 2424.23
it's the spherical ization of

2420.48 --> 2424.23
conceptualization itself

2456.26 --> 2458.4700000000003
yes

2458.56 --> 2469.15
no no Daniel the energy is actually the

2462.85 --> 2471.4
inherent force of pressure itself the

2469.15 --> 2475.15
molecules bumping into each other and

2471.4 --> 2478.6800000000003
this yeah these are actual molecules you

2475.15 --> 2481.42
can actually confirm they are molecules

2478.68 --> 2485.5299999999997
they're a complete set of matter in the

2481.42 --> 2489.37
gaseous form and they do have this this

2485.53 --> 2494.32
pressure that is a force it is inherent

2489.37 --> 2497.2799999999997
to gas and that can definitely be proven

2494.32 --> 2497.28
to be there

2505.339 --> 2509.13
and there's not a limited amount of that

2507.99 --> 2515.9399999999996
energy at all

2509.13 --> 2520.05
it is quite persistent it doesn't run

2515.94 --> 2526.05
out it's not like fuel gas pressure

2520.05 --> 2529.1090000000004
simply presses upon ya the rest of the

2526.05 --> 2532.17
gas all of the gas until an equilibrium

2529.109 --> 2534.48
has been found within the container and

2532.17 --> 2536.4900000000002
that's not gonna stop it's not gonna run

2534.48 --> 2540.119
out because the container is too big it

2536.49 --> 2542.9399999999996
is going to evenly distribute until the

2540.119 --> 2546.119
equilibrium is met and then eventually

2542.94 --> 2550.38
yeah once the equilibrium has been met a

2546.119 --> 2554.9300000000003
gradient may set in due to a parent or

2550.38 --> 2561.38
actual forces that are naturally present

2554.93 --> 2561.3799999999997
of which the container is a part

2569.83 --> 2576.13
it's not limited at all Daniel that

2572.92 --> 2579.66
that's really dumb thing to say it's not

2576.13 --> 2579.6600000000003
a limited amount of energy

2601.42 --> 2605.89
yeah that's right Daniel because

2603.34 --> 2608.71
relative density still applies the

2605.89 --> 2612.37
apparent force this equilibrium constant

2608.71 --> 2614.55
is still present what goes up must come

2612.37 --> 2614.5499999999997
down

2623.52 --> 2634.32
firing gas particles that's a good one

2626.32 --> 2638.8300000000004
but yeah in a sense you are correct and

2634.32 --> 2642.73
that's why after a equilibrium has set

2638.83 --> 2647.43
in within the container there will very

2642.73 --> 2647.43
likely form a gradient

2657.15 --> 2665.38
yeah but Daniel that's still assuming

2661.99 --> 2669.1899999999996
very blatantly that that process is

2665.38 --> 2673.29
being tried or done within a container

2669.19 --> 2676.63
so there's already a gas pressure

2673.29 --> 2679.75
equilibrium having been reached and the

2676.63 --> 2685.78
gradient due to a parent or real other

2679.75 --> 2688.89
forces but yeah once a container is

2685.78 --> 2694.21
breached then the gas pressure will

2688.89 --> 2698.08
redistribute itself very rapidly with a

2694.21 --> 2701.67
lot of power until a new equilibrium has

2698.08 --> 2701.67
been reached in the new container

2709.92 --> 2718.06
that's not dogmatism that is how it

2713.14 --> 2721.87
works you can try to demonstrate it to

2718.06 --> 2725.7999999999997
yourself if you have several containers

2721.87 --> 2727.87
that can be pressure regulated and with

2725.8 --> 2730.0
ports towards one another you could

2727.87 --> 2734.2
demonstrate exactly how that works it's

2730.0 --> 2735.91
very quick and then as soon as the

2734.2 --> 2740.5299999999997
equilibrium has been reached in the

2735.91 --> 2744.6299999999997
neutral container then the the strong

2740.53 --> 2747.94
force of the expansion stops and yeah

2744.63 --> 2750.4500000000003
other effects that in like for example a

2747.94 --> 2750.4500000000003
gradient

2763.0 --> 2768.97
that's ridiculous I didn't say that

2764.89 --> 2772.81
Daniel I didn't say gas will expand

2768.97 --> 2775.3599999999997
forever it will expand forever until a

2772.81 --> 2777.46
new equilibrium has been reached in a

2775.36 --> 2780.9
container and a container is per

2777.46 --> 2780.9
definition not forever

2805.08 --> 2813.87
okay well Simon dan you asked your

2808.95 --> 2817.89
question because Daniels just gonna keep

2813.87 --> 2820.35
on rambling as he does now chocolates

2817.89 --> 2824.04
say and Daniel is not a panelist he's a

2820.35 --> 2827.7
keyboard warrior who does ask pretty

2824.04 --> 2833.82
decent questions sometimes when he's in

2827.7 --> 2837.18
the mood for it but yeah I don't see him

2833.82 --> 2838.2000000000003
as a panelist so thanks for your input

2837.18 --> 2840.99
and questions

2838.2 --> 2844.89
Daniel it's good material to reflect

2840.99 --> 2847.1
upon and yeah thank you for that see you

2844.89 --> 2847.1
later

2862.27 --> 2867.84
oh that's interesting question Simon Dan

2872.24 --> 2878.45
the container we don't know what is what

2875.809 --> 2880.6400000000003
is the container we just know that there

2878.45 --> 2884.569
has to be one there has to be a limited

2880.64 --> 2886.91
confine in order for an equilibrium to

2884.569 --> 2890.3
be reached within the container because

2886.91 --> 2892.67
that's a necessary antecedent we don't

2890.3 --> 2899.21
know the dimensions of this container or

2892.67 --> 2901.099
how it functions I just know that it has

2899.21 --> 2903.44
to be there otherwise in equilibrium

2901.099 --> 2905.3900000000003
within the gas pressures within the

2903.44 --> 2908.89
system within this realm could not have

2905.39 --> 2908.89
been reached at any point

2921.29 --> 2930.44
well Daniel look I am not everyone and

2926.38 --> 2939.17
people make a lot of mistakes myself

2930.44 --> 2943.34
included at times but yeah I'm not

2939.17 --> 2945.38
selective on physics at all I just tried

2943.34 --> 2948.44
to take away a lot of base assumptions

2945.38 --> 2954.08
that are that have been become part of

2948.44 --> 2956.3
it like the over particle ization part

2954.08 --> 2962.84
particle theory in everything that's

2956.3 --> 2967.28
what I try to dispel so now Daniel don't

2962.84 --> 2972.4100000000003
go there the necessary it is gas

2967.28 --> 2978.02
pressure loss of entropy don't don't go

2972.41 --> 2985.7799999999997
up dancing on me all right okay Simon

2978.02 --> 2985.78
then what is your other questions

2993.63 --> 2997.23
no Daniel it's not Dogma you're being an

2996.72 --> 3005.33
ass

2997.23 --> 3007.57
stop it so what is your question Simon

3005.33 --> 3007.5699999999997
Dan

3017.28 --> 3022.3500000000004
right well Daniel technically a

3020.32 --> 3025.96
container could also be made of

3022.35 --> 3034.24
theoretical force fields or anything but

3025.96 --> 3037.0
anything that would emulate or copy this

3034.24 --> 3042.93
entire setup of what would be a physical

3037.0 --> 3045.82
container okay so that's optional enough

3042.93 --> 3048.81
it's still gonna basically be a physical

3045.82 --> 3048.81
container anyway

3056.13 --> 3063.79
[ __ ] you Simon dan I have no credentials

3059.35 --> 3069.7
okay piss off I'm give a [ __ ] about

3063.79 --> 3072.4
credentials I just learn as I go if it

3069.7 --> 3077.91
went over all of this stuff lots even in

3072.4 --> 3077.9100000000003
the past screw your credentials man

3080.75 --> 3084.69
[Music]

3121.5 --> 3131.29
no Daniel no it could not how many times

3127.3 --> 3137.29
they have to tell you this gravity

3131.29 --> 3139.87
cannot be the cause of a container it

3137.29 --> 3143.38
cannot because it is a steady force

3139.87 --> 3145.93
disequilibrium and even if you assumed

3143.38 --> 3148.36
all the ball gravity everything

3145.93 --> 3151.24
everything everything globe related

3148.36 --> 3155.2000000000003
about gravity if you assume all of it it

3151.24 --> 3158.29
can't do it it's a very steady but faint

3155.2 --> 3159.91
force that's even admit it in scientism

3158.29 --> 3163.45
circles it's part of the freaking

3159.91 --> 3166.27
consensus that you rest upon okay it

3163.45 --> 3168.52
can't do it it can only slightly push

3166.27 --> 3171.58
back and as the distance to the earth

3168.52 --> 3174.91
increases the amount of push that it can

3171.58 --> 3180.84
exert become smaller Wow

3174.91 --> 3183.58
gas pressure in an within the container

3180.84 --> 3186.46
which supposedly is going to be outer

3183.58 --> 3189.49
space yeah it's not gonna decrease in

3186.46 --> 3192.76
power it's gonna keep on pushing to all

3189.49 --> 3195.0299999999997
sides until an equilibrium has been

3192.76 --> 3197.98
reached and in that sense that power

3195.03 --> 3201.1600000000003
cannot be grabbed it it cannot be

3197.98 --> 3203.5
stopped it cannot be stopped without

3201.16 --> 3206.44
something that is seriously powerful and

3203.5 --> 3209.17
gravity officially is not strong enough

3206.44 --> 3214.15
to do it it's one of the biggest holes

3209.17 --> 3217.27
in the entire model even if you freaking

3214.15 --> 3222.19
assume it all then mathematically it

3217.27 --> 3226.23
doesn't freaking work okay I've tried to

3222.19 --> 3231.28
defend that concept don't be a [ __ ]

3226.23 --> 3234.76
don't lie about the actual math of the

3231.28 --> 3237.4900000000002
entire presuppositional system gravity

3234.76 --> 3241.0600000000004
is not strong enough to prevent the

3237.49 --> 3244.33
gases from escaping the atmosphere and

3241.06 --> 3246.97
finding an equilibrium within the total

3244.33 --> 3250.99
container of the imagined outer space

3246.97 --> 3254.2
universe it just doesn't it doesn't stop

3250.99 --> 3256.4199999999996
lying stop lying Daniel

3254.2 --> 3258.85
I've had a really interesting

3256.42 --> 3261.52
conversation so far but if you insist on

3258.85 --> 3263.91
this then you just piss off because it's

3261.52 --> 3263.91
not true

3264.15 --> 3270.67
and you can't say look at a higher

3268.0 --> 3273.94
altitude the pressure is lower yeah we

3270.67 --> 3276.04
know the gradient the gradient that can

3273.94 --> 3278.44
only set in after an equilibrium has

3276.04 --> 3281.8
been reached there is no flow there is

3278.44 --> 3283.75
no flow which means the equilibrium has

3281.8 --> 3286.6600000000003
already been reached otherwise it would

3283.75 --> 3290.86
be escaping right as you can demonstrate

3286.66 --> 3293.31
and get in gas pressure systems in

3290.86 --> 3296.32
containers and vacuum and everything

3293.31 --> 3299.11
it's not strong enough to do it if

3296.32 --> 3301.81
there's actual release into a vacuum

3299.11 --> 3304.6
gravity is never strong enough to stop

3301.81 --> 3310.32
that because it is considered officially

3304.6 --> 3310.3199999999997
by science standards as a weak force

3316.49 --> 3320.5099999999998
[Music]

3342.47 --> 3348.8999999999996
good piss off then because if you're

3346.53 --> 3352.9500000000003
gonna claim at any point again that

3348.9 --> 3357.36
gravity the assumed force and everything

3352.95 --> 3361.16
is strong enough to keep in the entropy

3357.36 --> 3364.07
force that is part of the nature of gas

3361.16 --> 3367.89
then you're just wrong it's a lie it's

3364.07 --> 3371.04
not strong enough it's a very basic low

3367.89 --> 3374.7599999999998
down force constant even assumed to be

3371.04 --> 3377.64
that and that can't be strong enough to

3374.76 --> 3379.6800000000003
prevent the gas from expanding within

3377.64 --> 3383.7
the container of outer space universe

3379.68 --> 3386.1
can't can never do that unless there's

3383.7 --> 3388.31
theorized a force barrier at some point

3386.1 --> 3391.0499999999997
even science fiction speculated this

3388.31 --> 3395.19
it's not even taken it's not even taken

3391.05 --> 3397.8900000000003
on because people are just too [ __ ]

3395.19 --> 3400.17
to realize that officially gravity is

3397.89 --> 3404.04
not strong enough to prevent gas

3400.17 --> 3407.1
pressure from escaping the surface of

3404.04 --> 3411.06
the earth into the open outer space

3407.1 --> 3413.88
container it can never do that can never

3411.06 --> 3416.4
ever do that can never be strong enough

3413.88 --> 3419.31
to prevent the escape of the gas

3416.4 --> 3425.4900000000002
pressure because it's just a push it's

3419.31 --> 3427.0499999999997
not a grab it's a push pushes pull so

3425.49 --> 3429.5699999999997
however you want to see it it's not

3427.05 --> 3432.57
grabbing it it's not actually stopping

3429.57 --> 3436.38
it so it's gonna be slowed down at best

3432.57 --> 3438.1200000000003
and with the might it would have as it

3436.38 --> 3443.12
tries to find an equilibrium in the

3438.12 --> 3446.31
outer space container it's gonna be

3443.12 --> 3448.23
insignificant amount of force compared

3446.31 --> 3450.62
to how quick that gas pressure would

3448.23 --> 3450.62
escape

3452.049 --> 3477.489
just model it out it's true I'm not

3471.489 --> 3480.929
interested in your heating utility

3477.489 --> 3480.929
repair skill Simon then

3500.96 --> 3504.219
[Music]

3526.9 --> 3533.28
[Music]

3538.48 --> 3542.55
[Music]

3621.41 --> 3628.67
how do dance that's funny that's a good

3624.89 --> 3631.009
what graham Brown how do dance things

3628.67 --> 3632.559
and people know which direction to fall

3631.009 --> 3635.779
well they don't

3632.559 --> 3643.67
there's no sentence or knowledge or

3635.779 --> 3649.42
insight yet they just go where they will

3643.67 --> 3649.42
find their relative density level

3650.229 --> 3663.1699999999996
they'll just go there's no knowledge

3655.819 --> 3666.91
involved now why do they fall down

3663.17 --> 3673.299
because well the the greater density

3666.91 --> 3673.299
level tends to be there down there

3674.229 --> 3680.259
that's just how it happens to have

3677.329 --> 3680.259
arranged itself

3697.53 --> 3704.76
right well that's because that lower

3700.89 --> 3710.8199999999997
density stuff below the heavier object

3704.76 --> 3716.1600000000003
is only in the way of more density down

3710.82 --> 3718.8900000000003
there it's so yeah it's useless okay the

3716.16 --> 3720.66
relative density it does work out it's

3718.89 --> 3727.7999999999997
really annoying I find it kind of

3720.66 --> 3729.75
annoying but it does work out my down so

3727.8 --> 3732.75
it doesn't answer everything though it

3729.75 --> 3736.31
was just there it's it's just there to

3732.75 --> 3744.24
give an actual scientific proof anchor

3736.31 --> 3745.46
that's all there is nothing pulling an

3744.24 --> 3752.0
object

3745.46 --> 3752.0
it's simply displacing to find a level I

3753.11 --> 3759.06
[Music]

3756.17 --> 3762.6
don't need to say anything I know what

3759.06 --> 3763.95
gravity is and what it's not probably

3762.6 --> 3767.67
more than most of you

3763.95 --> 3770.64
ballers and flat-earthers so it's not

3767.67 --> 3773.4
bollocks good a new roommate wow that's

3770.64 --> 3779.7
time for you to go piss off dude just

3773.4 --> 3783.4500000000003
[ __ ] off so yeah I'm gonna run out the

3779.7 --> 3785.25
show it was kind of fun I like having

3783.45 --> 3787.47
some good questions and some people

3785.25 --> 3789.09
actually sparring that's good I want

3787.47 --> 3790.2
more of that it's better than just

3789.09 --> 3794.06
hanging around

3790.2 --> 3798.4399999999996
I hope my audience enjoyed it as well

3794.06 --> 3801.7999999999997
maybe you learned something maybe i

3798.44 --> 3805.46
refreshed certain details about

3801.8 --> 3809.25
technicalities the set up of this world

3805.46 --> 3817.58
and if I have then it's all good so

3809.25 --> 3817.58
thank you all for coming even the trolls

3818.07 --> 3824.4700000000003
and yeah upload my video if you liked it

3822.16 --> 3826.21
and download it if you're a troll or a

3824.47 --> 3829.66
baller or whatever

3826.21 --> 3831.2200000000003
I already care about is a vote and yeah

3829.66 --> 3832.5699999999997
the subscribe to my channel if you

3831.22 --> 3834.22
haven't already and hit the bell

3832.57 --> 3836.8900000000003
notification so you can see when I'm

3834.22 --> 3841.5099999999998
going live which can be early today I

3836.89 --> 3844.98
went 25 minutes early and then to

3841.51 --> 3847.1200000000003
participation of Nathan starting up

3844.98 --> 3852.13
sooner and he's already I think he

3847.12 --> 3854.8599999999997
started up yeah so yeah if you want to

3852.13 --> 3858.2200000000003
be part of this panel sometime add me on

3854.86 --> 3861.4900000000002
skype and I'll get you on the show as a

3858.22 --> 3864.0699999999997
panelist it would be nice although yeah

3861.49 --> 3867.1
as long as you guys keep really active

3864.07 --> 3869.98
in chat and ask good questions so

3867.1 --> 3875.2599999999998
perfectly fine by me oh yeah over moco

3869.98 --> 3877.09
hashtag MIFA indeed and yeah if you want

3875.26 --> 3880.4500000000003
to help me out financially and help

3877.09 --> 3883.1200000000003
progress this show please donate to my

3880.45 --> 3886.2999999999997
super chap some super chat sometimes or

3883.12 --> 3889.5099999999998
yeah donate to my paypal will be very

3886.3 --> 3894.2200000000003
helpful and I'm doing pretty good right

3889.51 --> 3898.23
now so it's no hurry although I still

3894.22 --> 3901.27
have to like get that ticket to the

3898.23 --> 3905.83
Amsterdam Flat Earth conference which I

3901.27 --> 3911.62
definitely plan to visit I made a lot of

3905.83 --> 3913.87
people they'll be funny be cool so yeah

3911.62 --> 3922.48
I will be back tomorrow with Flat Earth

3913.87 --> 3928.02
early bird number 136 and until that

3922.48 --> 3928.02
time keep it flat

3929.25 --> 3960.529
