118.84 --> 123.159
cold

120.56 --> 125.799
there's no wind but there's just a big

123.159 --> 128.56
gray soup up there don't really see

125.799 --> 131.12
them clouds aren't exactly rushing so

128.56 --> 134.519
it's like kind of hanging still

131.12 --> 136.84
there unlike yesterday it just kept

134.519 --> 141.36
moving and moving and moving was a

136.84 --> 141.36
really clear night sky this

142.239 --> 146.239
night but yeah not

148.76 --> 151.76
now

155.44 --> 164.07999999999998
right

157.84 --> 164.08
so it is Sunday the 26th of November

166.06 --> 173.64000000000001
[Music]

167.879 --> 175.92
2023 temperature was 8Â° C oh

175.92 --> 181.76
CS

178.76 --> 181.76

191.599 --> 196.11999999999998
well according to this next weekend it's

193.36 --> 197.64000000000001
going to be or like halfway the week

196.12 --> 199.12
it's going to start freezing at night

197.64 --> 201.72
and then it's going to start snowing

199.12 --> 205.04
during the day

201.72 --> 205.04
apparently we'll

208.68 --> 214.59900000000002
see

210.64 --> 219.0
maybe it's going to be a white December

214.599 --> 221.76
that's very rare in the Netherland so

219.0 --> 221.76
that would be kind of

227.93 --> 234.28
[Music]

230.92 --> 238.67999999999998
cute right so

234.28 --> 241.84
yeah hope everybody's had a

238.68 --> 245.20000000000002
great set of holidays with the

241.84 --> 247.68
Thanksgiving and all that all the extra

245.2 --> 249.959
days box or day and all these things I

247.68 --> 252.56
don't can't really keep track of was

249.959 --> 256.28000000000003
that boxer day or was that after

252.56 --> 260.26
Christmas I don't know anyway I got an

256.28 --> 263.279
Illuminati C here nice and

260.26 --> 263.279
[Music]

268.6 --> 274.399
warm

271.29 --> 274.399
[Music]

278.69 --> 283.87
[Music]

287.039 --> 291.56
ah

288.8 --> 295.40000000000003
right so yeah yesterday's show went

291.56 --> 295.4
pretty well I thought thought it was

297.52 --> 303.039
great but yeah later

300.479 --> 305.15999999999997
the ball busters I was not very active

303.039 --> 305.15999999999997
in

306.16 --> 309.88000000000005
it I was just

311.28 --> 317.63899999999995
like I because if I had intervened I'd

315.0 --> 319.16
probably become a contrarian and get on

317.639 --> 321.6
everybody's nerves and I didn't feel

319.16 --> 321.6
like doing

323.0 --> 327.96
it like a lot of ki's presentation I I

326.479 --> 330.8
already knew that it was basically

327.96 --> 333.44
rehashing stuff that these presented

330.8 --> 335.88
already but it was kind of good to go

333.44 --> 335.88
through it

338.68 --> 343.96
again oh complex spe what is it

344.88 --> 353.68
the sequence comp complex

350.72 --> 357.03900000000004
specified sequence what was it

353.68 --> 358.24
again sequence specified complexity that

357.039 --> 362.24
was the

358.24 --> 362.24
word that's it's like one of those

363.96 --> 369.88
words but it proves a

367.44 --> 371.96
designer it's like in nature like

369.88 --> 375.24
certain types of Arrangements not

371.96 --> 379.23999999999995
information though provably because

375.24 --> 381.56
that's purely in the mind it's not

379.24 --> 383.68
physical but anyway yeah it was good to

381.56 --> 385.919
go through it all again and I did not

383.68 --> 388.44
really contribute much eventually I kind

385.919 --> 390.039
of laugh because after the show was over

388.44 --> 392.08
like Jesus

390.039 --> 395.08
Brian was all bickery

392.08 --> 397.44
again so I was extra glad that I stayed

395.08 --> 397.44
out of

401.52 --> 408.0
it

404.44 --> 408.0
anyway right

411.24 --> 418.40000000000003
so nobody here yet in the chat 12

415.56 --> 421.4
watching according to

418.4 --> 421.4
YouTube

427.599 --> 430.68
maybe you all had late

437.36 --> 443.44
nights me not so much I really like

440.36 --> 445.8
after that staying up to past five I'm

443.44 --> 447.28
like I'm not doing it like I'm moving

445.8 --> 449.919
the other direction now I'm going to go

447.28 --> 453.35999999999996
to bed earlier and earlier

449.919 --> 455.84
so I had a yeah good shower which is

453.36 --> 458.599
like extra Pleasant because just hot

455.84 --> 461.479
water I mean one way to really warm up

458.599 --> 465.479
is to just like really hot

461.479 --> 465.479
shower and that was very

465.879 --> 472.879
nice right I feel very well

470.44 --> 476.8
rested was a bit disappointed with my

472.879 --> 480.12
dinner because I had like stuff together

476.8 --> 482.68
to make like a certain rice dish but

480.12 --> 484.84000000000003
then as I suspected but didn't really

482.68 --> 489.0
act upon when I was in the supermarket

484.84 --> 490.84
it turns out I was out of rice so I'm

489.0 --> 493.319
like damn

490.84 --> 495.11999999999995
it I have to still get some rice and

493.319 --> 498.199
then I can make

495.12 --> 499.72
it so unfortunately yesterday's was just

498.199 --> 501.68
more french

499.72 --> 504.24
fries

501.68 --> 507.639
but I

504.24 --> 510.44
mean it's not bad but I'm really looking

507.639 --> 512.919
forward to like a more

510.44 --> 512.919
complete

514.039 --> 518.76
meal wow where the hell is

524.279 --> 529.76
everyone I will just start posting the

526.68 --> 529.76

welcome I think I'm going to start

594.32 --> 598.12
eating this Illuminati kasan because I'm

596.64 --> 601.12
kind of hungry

598.12 --> 601.12
and

601.6 --> 606.76
waiting for more people to get

603.64 --> 610.4399999999999

628.04 --> 631.04
cheers

632.24 --> 635.44
[Music]

644.72 --> 648.6
hi teret 306 good to see

649.9 --> 653.0799999999999
[Music]

658.04 --> 661.04
you

662.66 --> 665.8399999999999
[Music]

684.13 --> 687.32
[Music]

687.959 --> 690.959
a

707.88 --> 713.079
right so I don't know what's going on

710.519 --> 713.079
out in the

717.959 --> 720.959
world

721.32 --> 727.8000000000001
so I'm like keeping track on the

725.2 --> 727.8000000000001
sideline

729.32 --> 735.399
here and there's a lot of Suspicion from

732.839 --> 738.72
for for democracy

735.399 --> 742.04
voters that votes are of forum for

738.72 --> 743.48
democracy specifically have been ignored

742.04 --> 745.8389999999999
like they have not been registers

743.48 --> 749.1990000000001
there's people that did tests with this

745.839 --> 752.9590000000001
and they voted on like really down the

749.199 --> 755.5999999999999
list of the of the party

752.959 --> 757.3599999999999
like that like nobody would probably

755.6 --> 759.88
vote for just the

757.36 --> 762.639
tested and they took photographs of

759.88 --> 766.32
their vote ballot and then they checked

762.639 --> 769.44
later with their location how much was

766.32 --> 770.9590000000001
counted and it wasn't counted so there

769.44 --> 772.519
is

770.959 --> 775.4399999999999
like

772.519 --> 778.04
provable vote counting fraud going on in

775.44 --> 780.839
the country specifically against form

778.04 --> 780.8389999999999
for democracy

780.88 --> 787.079
apparently I did not go as far as to

784.04 --> 789.76
like go all thorough on my vote I mean I

787.079 --> 793.8
just did it I I kind of didn't expect I

789.76 --> 793.8
expect that it was going to get rigged

795.0 --> 798.48
anyway I kind of

798.8 --> 804.04
do I mean the freaking government is

801.92 --> 807.24
like trying to ban them like they're a

804.04 --> 809.3199999999999
Nazi party so when they're at that

807.24 --> 811.199
attitude you can bet your as there's

809.32 --> 813.6
going to be vote counting fraud because

811.199 --> 815.04
all these people think is Justified

813.6 --> 817.0400000000001
because they've

815.04 --> 819.24
indoctrinated and so they're panicking

817.04 --> 821.0
and doing that and think it's okay they

819.24 --> 822.72
they don't feel bad about themselves

821.0 --> 824.48
because they've been indoctrinated that

822.72 --> 827.76
they're actually

824.48 --> 830.9590000000001
Nazis form for democracy but that's

827.76 --> 830.959
apparently going on

835.279 --> 843.16
so I'm kind of pissed off really

839.6 --> 843.16
wonder what the next move is going to

849.04 --> 854.88
be cuz

851.72 --> 858.32
logically the amount of votes they got

854.88 --> 861.519
is completely illogical it does not

858.32 --> 864.36
reflect the audience the amount of

861.519 --> 867.68
people that are behind them it does not

864.36 --> 870.6800000000001
reflect it at

867.68 --> 870.68
all

880.24 --> 883.72
anyway nobody

884.519 --> 888.6
cares hey LSG good to see

894.44 --> 900.6800000000001
[Music]

897.68 --> 900.68
you

905.839 --> 912.9590000000001
yeah that's cute ter it I mean yeah it's

909.68 --> 915.68
giving wrong notifications about times

912.959 --> 917.5189999999999
like I get it already I hear it all the

915.68 --> 919.959
time there's no need to remind me it's

917.519 --> 922.44
just stupid

919.959 --> 926.8389999999999
glitch right as long as you can watch my

922.44 --> 926.839
show life that's good enough

927.6 --> 930.6
right

933.25 --> 936.45
[Music]

939.23 --> 950.35
[Music]

957.6 --> 960.6
oh

963.639 --> 967.24
right so that's

967.68 --> 974.8
happening you did get a notification

970.12 --> 974.8
okay that's great first time in ages oh

978.72 --> 985.0790000000001
okay look another way to

982.12 --> 988.72
get direct

985.079 --> 989.7589999999999
notifications is if you I don't know you

988.72 --> 992.6
can get

989.759 --> 995.0
like uh what do you

992.6 --> 996.72
call push notifications that in the

995.0 --> 999.72
corner of your screen you can get that

996.72 --> 1003.1600000000001
like with Twitter right because every

999.72 --> 1005.72
time I start a show I post out the Tweet

1003.16 --> 1008.279
about my show right before I start my

1005.72 --> 1012.639
show I do it every

1008.279 --> 1015.0
time so if the YouTube push notification

1012.639 --> 1016.92
or notification in the list or whatever

1015.0 --> 1019.04
isn't showing then maybe you could like

1016.92 --> 1021.4399999999999
use Twitter notifications

1019.04 --> 1021.4399999999999
on my

1023.16 --> 1030.6
channel maybe that will

1026.439 --> 1030.6000000000001
work I don't know just giving a

1032.0 --> 1035.119

1155.12 --> 1161.84
bit but I mean it only really works when

1339.76 --> 1344.919

1346.96 --> 1349.96

wreck uh are you talking about an animal

1392.51 --> 1395.619
[Music]

[Music]

1402.2 --> 1405.44
okay what

1406.88 --> 1409.88
happened

1468.46 --> 1471.529
[Music]

1472.88 --> 1476.0800000000002
damn truck came to a sudden oh you

1474.679 --> 1480.3990000000001
crashed into

1476.08 --> 1480.399
a a truck that went full

1480.799 --> 1487.9189999999999
break sounds like somebody wasn't

1484.36 --> 1487.9189999999999
actually keeping the proper

1491.15 --> 1494.199
[Music]

1494.76 --> 1500.08
distance but yeah that sucks I take

1497.96 --> 1502.24
you're not hurt or anything glad of that

1500.08 --> 1502.24
at

1517.47 --> 1522.349
[Music]

1524.679 --> 1530.3200000000002
least good insurance okay I'm glad of

1527.52 --> 1530.32
that at

1556.24 --> 1561.76
least hm

1558.32 --> 1564.559
maybe get another car you think well if

1561.76 --> 1566.2
your car is total I think you definitely

1564.559 --> 1569.48
are going to get another car wouldn't

1566.2 --> 1573.0800000000002
you say not

1569.48 --> 1573.08
maybe that's why it's

1580.24 --> 1587.1200000000001
total total is basically like yeah it's

1584.24 --> 1588.919
damaged so much that repairing it's

1587.12 --> 1593.2399999999998
going to be more expensive than just

1588.919 --> 1593.24
getting a new one that's why it's called

1605.08 --> 1609.24
total

1606.919 --> 1611.2
anyway as long as you're still in one

1609.24 --> 1616.0
piece hope your insurance is going to

1611.2 --> 1616.0
not going to shoot up too high now with

1616.6 --> 1619.6
that

1622.08 --> 1630.6399999999999
next time though keep a little bit more

1625.679 --> 1633.799
distance then seems comfortable trust

1630.64 --> 1636.159
me in the beginning when I like only was

1633.799 --> 1638.24
a fresh driver and even like during

1636.159 --> 1641.2
driving lessons I made that mistake a

1638.24 --> 1644.1200000000001
lot you got to actually keep a decent

1641.2 --> 1646.52
distance from a truck from a truck even

1644.12 --> 1648.4399999999998
more than a

1646.52 --> 1651.76
car

1648.44 --> 1656.0
because trucks well get in the way so

1651.76 --> 1659.12
that takes away from your response time

1656.0 --> 1664.0
so you really need that distance behind

1659.12 --> 1664.0
it cuz it's harder to size

1664.679 --> 1669.279
up compared to just a regular

1672.399 --> 1677.8799999999999
car like with a regular car you can

1675.72 --> 1680.559
actually see past and through through

1677.88 --> 1682.2
the car to sort of like secondhand

1680.559 --> 1684.6
anticipate what that driver is going to

1682.2 --> 1687.679
do much more easily compared to a truck

1684.6 --> 1690.48
where you literally can't see anything

1687.679 --> 1695.88
what they're seeing cuz it's all in the

1690.48 --> 1699.3600000000001
way and that means you need more

1695.88 --> 1702.3600000000001
distance because you need more response

1699.36 --> 1705.399
time because you can't have that extra

1702.36 --> 1709.08
view Second Hand of what the driver in

1705.399 --> 1711.559
front of you is doing you see it's all

1709.08 --> 1717.76
logical this is one of the reasons I've

1711.559 --> 1717.76
never ever got into an accident in a car

1718.96 --> 1727.08
ever when that would have definitely

1722.039 --> 1730.0
happened like I escaped accident

1727.08 --> 1733.32
situations where a car would get into an

1730.0 --> 1736.679
accident and I managed to basically

1733.32 --> 1740.1589999999999
slip by or like prevent getting hit and

1736.679 --> 1743.039
all that because I look I do the

1740.159 --> 1745.88
secondhand looking all the time I'm

1743.039 --> 1750.799
obsessed with it I'm paranoid about it

1745.88 --> 1754.5590000000002
it's like no I assume everybody's a

1750.799 --> 1757.6399999999999
complete spaz out [Â __Â ] that could at

1754.559 --> 1759.519
any second for no damn reason especially

1757.64 --> 1762.96
if it's a bad timing suddenly could get

1759.519 --> 1765.279
like vaccine damage spaz and

1762.96 --> 1769.799
literally

1765.279 --> 1772.559
like yeah have the car whatever hit

1769.799 --> 1774.76
another like I'm expecting that all the

1772.559 --> 1778.48
time every second and here's the weird

1774.76 --> 1781.039
thing I was expecting that sort of even

1778.48 --> 1784.519
20 years

1781.039 --> 1787.08
ago because when you do that it just

1784.519 --> 1789.559
makes you

1787.08 --> 1791.6399999999999
responsible like no matter what like

1789.559 --> 1794.48
it's just you're on the road you're

1791.64 --> 1796.3200000000002
responsible for everything that happens

1794.48 --> 1799.96
no matter

1796.32 --> 1803.8799999999999
what and that means you must anticipate

1799.96 --> 1806.1200000000001
the idiocy of people like you must

1803.88 --> 1808.3600000000001
anticipate the idiocy of people

1806.12 --> 1811.32
including that they think they're not

1808.36 --> 1814.519
idiots and

1811.32 --> 1817.279
everything and just see it coming see

1814.519 --> 1819.039
when an accident's coming I can see when

1817.279 --> 1821.559
it's coming I can see when it's going to

1819.039 --> 1824.039
happen and I know what to do and how to

1821.559 --> 1826.32
stay out of that accident when I see it

1824.039 --> 1829.24
coming and that's why I've never ever

1826.32 --> 1829.24
got into an accident

1829.6 --> 1833.519
then it's more than just

1838.399 --> 1847.4399999999998
luck all right but anyway that's me I'm

1842.799 --> 1850.08
Lo using my psychic talents to do that

1847.44 --> 1850.0800000000002
it kind of

1850.48 --> 1857.799
is but the just assuming everybody's a

1854.799 --> 1861.44
SP [Â __Â ] that just got get a a heart

1857.799 --> 1864.559
attack any second it does actually help

1861.44 --> 1868.279
sharpen you up it's like oh blah blah

1864.559 --> 1869.559
blah blah yeah yeah shut up I'm focusing

1868.279 --> 1872.44
on the

1869.559 --> 1875.72
road you

1872.44 --> 1878.0800000000002
know a lot of people are like so easy to

1875.72 --> 1881.1200000000001
get distracted I'm like

1878.08 --> 1884.039
dude you're

1881.12 --> 1886.7199999999998
crazy like you're lit like this is

1884.039 --> 1888.84
literally like having a conversation

1886.72 --> 1891.44
right next next to a wood chipper

1888.84 --> 1893.4399999999998
without without protecting plates and

1891.44 --> 1895.3200000000002
all that you're just having a casual

1893.44 --> 1897.679
conversation right next to the wood

1895.32 --> 1899.799
chipper all you have to do is just oh

1897.679 --> 1902.2
and you're dead you get sucked in it and

1899.799 --> 1905.639
you're dead like

1902.2 --> 1908.44
hello you're in a moving

1905.639 --> 1911.08
car it's very

1908.44 --> 1914.799
dangerous just because you somehow

1911.08 --> 1919.1589999999999
manage to survive that mostly doesn't

1914.799 --> 1919.1589999999999
mean that it isn't dangerous

1919.2 --> 1925.96
hello McFly I think yeah that's right

1921.679 --> 1928.96
Tommy you heard that you heard that

1925.96 --> 1928.96
right

1933.54 --> 1937.8799999999999
[Music]

1935.519 --> 1939.08
anyway I drive with my knees while

1937.88 --> 1943.159
rolling a

1939.08 --> 1943.1589999999999
cigarette that's a new Iron

1946.08 --> 1951.639
26 I

1948.36 --> 1953.76
mean by that standard I'm going to

1951.639 --> 1957.24
expect that you're just not going to

1953.76 --> 1960.039
show up one day

1957.24 --> 1963.1200000000001
okay I mean unless you're like on the

1960.039 --> 1966.679
freeway or like on a on

1963.12 --> 1969.32
a an empty way like in between states

1966.679 --> 1971.48
where literally you can drive for an

1969.32 --> 1975.9189999999999
hour before even bumping into another

1971.48 --> 1978.559
car okay then it's fine you can probably

1975.919 --> 1981.159
do that and you got like auto drive and

1978.559 --> 1983.6789999999999
all it's but like if you're on a busy

1981.159 --> 1987.6000000000001
highway and you do that you're [Â __Â ]

1983.679 --> 1987.6000000000001
insane dude you're

1990.32 --> 1997.6789999999999
crazy morning

1993.679 --> 1997.679
traffic hey it's your life

2001.32 --> 2008.48
man you know what you could also

2004.08 --> 2012.519
do is roll your

2008.48 --> 2017.6390000000001
cigarettes before you go

2012.519 --> 2019.799
driving huh put them in a in a roll or

2017.639 --> 2022.4799999999998
whatever and you roll them before and

2019.799 --> 2027.279
then you could just get them

2022.48 --> 2029.279
out stay focused on the road you know

2027.279 --> 2031.799
like unless you're like if you'd be

2029.279 --> 2035.72
stuck in traffic and it's

2031.799 --> 2037.1589999999999
like you're barely moving yeah okay then

2035.72 --> 2038.519
there's no yeah you can roll the

2037.159 --> 2040.679
cigarette whatever you can even step

2038.519 --> 2042.679
outside of your car you know that's

2040.679 --> 2045.48
different but if it's

2042.679 --> 2050.079
moving and it's like a busy highway dude

2045.48 --> 2050.079
don't just please don't do

2057.599 --> 2063.52
that I can drive the entire Tollway with

2060.76 --> 2065.8390000000004
me that's hilarious aumu virus but you

2063.52 --> 2068.879
see I do that sort of weird thing

2065.839 --> 2068.879
sometimes too

2068.919 --> 2076.1589999999997
but the thing

2071.48 --> 2078.76
is I still then I take it like a sport

2076.159 --> 2080.44
right I do things where I'm like yeah I

2078.76 --> 2084.48
can drive with one

2080.44 --> 2087.399
finger but while I do that I have

2084.48 --> 2089.56
maximum Focus I treat it like a sport

2087.399 --> 2091.52
it's like yeah I'm not going to do that

2089.56 --> 2093.56
when somebody's right next to me in the

2091.52 --> 2095.8
car or something

2093.56 --> 2097.7599999999998
right that could distract me that could

2095.8 --> 2103.76
get panicked or whatever if I'm doing

2097.76 --> 2103.76
that so yeah I do trickery too I I like

2104.24 --> 2112.2799999999997
trickery and I like sharp driving but

2108.44 --> 2115.4
I'm not going to like Risk [Â __Â ] by like

2112.28 --> 2119.52
oh I need to secretly text somebody on

2115.4 --> 2122.0
my phone and I I can't do it like at hat

2119.52 --> 2123.64
at hat height because then it could I

2122.0 --> 2126.04
could get it fine so I have to like do

2123.64 --> 2128.64
it like this and and [Â __Â ] risk

2126.04 --> 2132.92
smacking it to a truck yeah yeah that

2128.64 --> 2132.92
[Â __Â ] I don't do

2136.04 --> 2143.7599999999998
yeah take driving very serious and

2138.599 --> 2143.76
that's wife I've never ever had an

2148.72 --> 2154.48
accident and that's some close calls by

2151.24 --> 2157.3999999999996
the way but it's more because of my

2154.48 --> 2160.079
own fanaticism

2157.4 --> 2160.079
but never

2166.16 --> 2171.2799999999997
actually safe driving is the topic of

2168.76 --> 2175.4
the day yeah clutch it kind of is akumu

2171.28 --> 2177.92
virus apparently total his his car by

2175.4 --> 2180.8
driving into a truck that suddenly break

2177.92 --> 2182.8
in front of him apparently not keeping a

2180.8 --> 2185.7200000000003
safe

2182.8 --> 2188.52
distance so yeah that's kind of the

2185.72 --> 2192.4399999999996
theme

2188.52 --> 2192.44
at least the first

2196.91 --> 2202.0699999999997
[Music]

2208.04 --> 2212.88
part I miss driving it's been

2215.68 --> 2218.68
years

2226.72 --> 2232.3999999999996
I was thinking of having a Sim racing

2229.76 --> 2232.4
setup

2236.119 --> 2244.359
what

2238.64 --> 2244.359
okay didn't take you for a s player but

2244.48 --> 2249.56
whatever no hate driving oh okay I love

2249.64 --> 2258.359
it but it's because I'm so damn good at

2254.2 --> 2262.1189999999997
it I am I am a good D like I

2258.359 --> 2262.119
can like speed

2264.0 --> 2269.359
drive like take really sharp Corners

2267.28 --> 2271.52
like even with the sliding and

2269.359 --> 2273.48
everything I mean it's just that I never

2271.52 --> 2277.359
get to do

2273.48 --> 2278.28
it cuz it's kind of not legal

2277.359 --> 2281.839
the

2278.28 --> 2283.0
speed and to do that it was a joke man

2281.839 --> 2284.88
oh

2283.0 --> 2287.24
okay

2284.88 --> 2289.88
whatever how would I be able to tell

2287.24 --> 2289.8799999999997
that that was a

2299.0 --> 2305.04
joke damn

2486.72 --> 2490.72
super

2487.96 --> 2492.119
rare it's most and not on the highways

2490.72 --> 2497.04
they just can't get

2492.119 --> 2501.7200000000003

2586.839 --> 2591.64
doesn't

2587.92 --> 2593.599
work yeah I mean at these traffic sites

2591.64 --> 2597.7599999999998

retest there's like when you're older or

not really 5 years old Expedition truth

2868.079 --> 2873.7200000000003
but they do start young though I think

2871.24 --> 2873.72
it's like

2874.72 --> 2877.72
12

2881.68 --> 2886.96
you can't drive a tractor when you're 5

2884.0 --> 2891.28

2886.96 --> 2891.28
no not under supervision

anyway they start with the yeah because

2894.44 --> 2899.119
you can actually drive a tractor younger

have done it when I was eight or 10 I

2953.48 --> 2957.44

that I mean hey we got plenty of farmers

2994.96 --> 2997.52
here

2997.559 --> 3003.44

3000.799 --> 3003.44
they could do

that

3049.799 --> 3057.119
H wow that's weird I'm looking at that

3053.52 --> 3059.319
graph you shared Ste traveler but

3057.119 --> 3063.52
apparently in North Korea nobody's

3059.319 --> 3063.52
allowed to drive at all

3068.2 --> 3073.52
what and in one of these African

3070.76 --> 3077.119
countries you're only allowed to drive

3073.52 --> 3080.48
above 23

3077.119 --> 3080.48
what that's

3084.359 --> 3089.68
weird

3086.48 --> 3093.92
huh anyway

3089.68 --> 3093.9199999999996
interesting thanks for that link steamy

3106.68 --> 3113.2
traveler does North goree even have cars

3110.04 --> 3114.359
yes but I mean it probably means you can

3113.2 --> 3118.1189999999997
only

3114.359 --> 3120.44
drive as a function from the state so

3118.119 --> 3123.6400000000003
it's like you have a task to drive that

3120.44 --> 3126.64
car it it basically means as a citizen

3123.64 --> 3130.0
you're not allowed to have a car and

3126.64 --> 3132.5589999999997
drive it's only within like

3130.0 --> 3135.88
functions like

3132.559 --> 3138.76
that so you probably like get a driver's

3135.88 --> 3141.92
license from your company

3138.76 --> 3146.119
or like

3141.92 --> 3148.559
that from the state itself

3146.119 --> 3150.079
but only as long as you work for them

3148.559 --> 3153.28
like

3150.079 --> 3155.2400000000002
that could be I mean I'm speculating I'm

3153.28 --> 3159.559
just noticed that it was all black on

3155.24 --> 3159.5589999999997

wow okay steam traveler that's

3250.319 --> 3256.24

3252.96 --> 3258.04
like the idea of a taxi driver almost

3256.24 --> 3259.8799999999997
it's like you have to it's just a

5871.239 --> 5877.36
to stream with

5872.8 --> 5880.8
that it's so good t such a good taste

5877.36 --> 5883.28
man I mean you are quality if you start

5880.8 --> 5885.679
your stream with that doesn't make you

5883.28 --> 5887.239
look really cheap at

5885.679 --> 5890.2390000000005
all

5887.239 --> 5890.239
huh

5893.08 --> 5898.0
trashy the more I'm thinking about it

5895.48 --> 5901.5199999999995
the more I'm wondering does Flats side

5898.0 --> 5906.84
actually live in a trash Heap like his

5901.52 --> 5909.52
building is like in a in like a trash

5906.84 --> 5911.56
place there's like car wrecks everywhere

5909.52 --> 5913.719
or something like it just it starts to

5911.56 --> 5915.76
feel like that like maybe he's just so

5913.719 --> 5919.4
comfortable with trash he just can't

5915.76 --> 5921.92
help himself but just like and seek out

5919.4 --> 5925.079
trashy

5921.92 --> 5925.079
[Music]

5928.639 --> 5932.56
things he quotes the Bible and acts like

5931.159 --> 5935.08
like that no he acts like a

5932.56 --> 5938.0
self-righteous pompus

5935.08 --> 5941.159
[Â __Â ] yeah and if you don't agree with

5938.0 --> 5944.719
the Trinity and if you don't agree that

5941.159 --> 5947.839999999999
that he is his own father and praying to

5944.719 --> 5951.159
himself or fulfilling and all that [Â __Â ]

5947.84 --> 5953.92
well then you go to hell cuz Flats

5951.159 --> 5957.08
side's really good at judging these

5953.92 --> 5962.119
things you know he's so good at

5957.08 --> 5964.88
it mean you can trust on him I mean he

5962.119 --> 5967.96
likes Troll videos how could you not

5964.88 --> 5971.56
trust him with the Judgment of whether

5967.96 --> 5974.44
your soul Goes to Hell Or Not Right

5971.56 --> 5974.4400000000005
makes perfect

5982.7 --> 5986.63
[Music]

5988.679 --> 5993.32
sense Bible Trasher I don't know if he's

5991.719 --> 5996.36
a

5993.32 --> 5999.5199999999995
Trasher I mean I have been extremely

5996.36 --> 6003.32
critical of the Bible in many

5999.52 --> 6005.96
ways but and I am like kind of sick of

6003.32 --> 6009.08
dumb Christians of overgeneralizing

6005.96 --> 6012.159
Christians that in my opinion are anti-

6009.08 --> 6015.239
chist Christians because they literally

6012.159 --> 6017.92
believe illogical lies based on nothing

6015.239 --> 6021.32
based on what other people have

6017.92 --> 6023.76
said people that aren't even in the book

6021.32 --> 6026.639
and so I'm [Â __Â ] sick of those people

6023.76 --> 6029.679
and anybody that Associates with

6026.639 --> 6033.08
that anybody who's actually willing to

6029.679 --> 6036.719
seek out and strive for the actual

6033.08 --> 6038.239
wisdom of Jesus that's another thing

6036.719 --> 6043.8
yeah you will know them by their fruit

6038.239 --> 6047.04
you will know them by their wise actions

6043.8 --> 6048.679
or by their deluded double speak which

6047.04 --> 6051.8
is of

6048.679 --> 6052.88
Satan you will know them Jesus gave you

6051.8 --> 6055.320000000001
everything you

6052.88 --> 6058.4800000000005
need now it's up to you whether you're

6055.32 --> 6062.28
going to see it and accept it or

6058.48 --> 6063.99
not yeah and not what [Â __Â ] priests

6062.28 --> 6065.44
say about

6063.99 --> 6067.04
[Music]

6065.44 --> 6070.36
it

6067.04 --> 6072.639
yeah so that's my view on it I don't

6070.36 --> 6074.5599999999995
know what flat thinks about the Bible

6072.639 --> 6077.0
and all of it I don't care at this point

6074.56 --> 6079.84
I mean he likes [Â __Â ] troll

6077.0 --> 6081.48
channels what more do you need to

6079.84 --> 6085.8
know

6081.48 --> 6088.718999999999
yeah I mean dupons is a Ballard I make

6085.8 --> 6093.2390000000005
fun of him I also protect him if dupons

6088.719 --> 6095.4800000000005
would start posting [Â __Â ] anti- Flat

6093.239 --> 6098.598999999999
Earth videos that are shitty and

6095.48 --> 6102.919999999999
trollish you think I'd still protect

6098.599 --> 6106.0
him no I'd kick him the [Â __Â ] out of here

6102.92 --> 6109.84
he doesn't do that because he's just a

6106.0 --> 6114.36
Ballard he's not a troll

6109.84 --> 6118.360000000001
scumbag he doesn't like that which is

6114.36 --> 6118.36
good means there's hope for

6126.239 --> 6132.759999999999
him so you should confirm if he's still

6130.159 --> 6136.08
no darrett

6132.76 --> 6137.08
just just let duper just do what he

6136.08 --> 6140.239
wants

6137.08 --> 6142.5199999999995
and he's just exploring and trying to

6140.239 --> 6144.239
figure it out out and then some he's

6142.52 --> 6145.599
going to get really enthusiastic about

6144.239 --> 6147.32
the ball again and then he's going to

6145.599 --> 6149.400000000001
get kind of skeptical about the ball

6147.32 --> 6151.639
again and then he will get really

6149.4 --> 6154.119
enthusiastic about it I mean it goes

6151.639 --> 6155.88
back and forth I I know duper now for

6154.119 --> 6159.119
almost a year or

6155.88 --> 6162.159000000001
more I see him everywhere in the chats

6159.119 --> 6162.159
where I hang around

6166.0 --> 6172.84
so he literally said it yesterday oh

6169.52 --> 6176.0
okay right well he does go back and

6172.84 --> 6178.4400000000005
forth with his VI is just never really

6176.0 --> 6180.4
letting the globe go though which is

6178.44 --> 6183.48
very typical that that's what makes you

6180.4 --> 6185.44
a ballar it's not that you don't know

6183.48 --> 6187.598999999999
how to let it go it's that you refuse to

6185.44 --> 6190.5599999999995
let it

6187.599 --> 6193.2390000000005
go like despite

6190.56 --> 6197.0
reason all right

6193.239 --> 6197.0
anyway I'm going to get

6199.679 --> 6202.679
cof

6229.679 --> 6232.679
for

6275.44 --> 6282.239
it's gullible to believe in the ball

6278.0 --> 6282.239
yeah it is that's

6282.8 --> 6285.8
right

6288.52 --> 6294.1990000000005
man maybe turn these freaking heaters

6296.599 --> 6302.2390000000005
on at this point any heat assistance

6299.76 --> 6302.2390000000005
would be

6304.88 --> 6310.2390000000005
great all right I hope you're all having

6307.199 --> 6310.239
a good time this

6315.53 --> 6322.48
[Music]

6319.48 --> 6322.48
Sunday

6339.199 --> 6344.96
it's a good filter for sure to get stuck

6342.679 --> 6348.76
with someone suffering from

6344.96 --> 6351.639
bardism bation you mean I don't know

6348.76 --> 6353.84
could be a worst thing in the world

6351.639 --> 6355.36
I mean you'd be surprised if you like if

6353.84 --> 6358.28
you

6355.36 --> 6361.839999999999
master a

6358.28 --> 6364.88
Ballard like you you make sure that they

6361.84 --> 6366.679
see that you know that the Earth is flat

6364.88 --> 6369.2390000000005
and that you can't get through to that

6366.679 --> 6370.84
that they stop trying to convince you

6369.239 --> 6372.48
you'll find that a lot of them are

6370.84 --> 6377.4400000000005
actually like

6372.48 --> 6377.44
really like flat Earth is impress

6379.4 --> 6385.32
ballards

6382.28 --> 6387.5199999999995
yeah anti flat earthers not because they

6385.32 --> 6389.44
NE they always what the thing about anti

6387.52 --> 6392.2390000000005
flat earthers is that they always start

6389.44 --> 6394.5599999999995
out with we're better than the flat

6392.239 --> 6396.879999999999
earthers but that's not necessarily what

6394.56 --> 6398.320000000001
balarts do balarts are just like no

6396.88 --> 6401.119
we're just never going to let the ball

6398.32 --> 6404.84
go no matter what but they'll still have

6401.119 --> 6408.28
respect for you for understanding

6404.84 --> 6410.8
things right so that that's kind of like

6408.28 --> 6413.0
the relation I got with dupons and akumu

6410.8 --> 6415.76
virus is like I'll tell them like yeah

6413.0 --> 6417.639
it's definitely not that ball it's flat

6415.76 --> 6419.52
and they'll Spotter and this and that

6417.639 --> 6421.88
but then after that's done they'll just

6419.52 --> 6424.52
like be right back and like yeah okay

6421.88 --> 6426.639
that's done let's move

6424.52 --> 6431.080000000001
on

6426.639 --> 6433.8
so anti-at earther behavior is an

6431.08 --> 6434.76
attitude is very different from typical

6433.8 --> 6439.0
just

6434.76 --> 6441.76
bation bation is really all about it's

6439.0 --> 6444.599
not about all a political dichotomy

6441.76 --> 6448.8
right anti flat arism is really about a

6444.599 --> 6450.56
political dichotomy of flat earthers we

6448.8 --> 6452.719
are ballers we are better than flat

6450.56 --> 6454.92
earthers that's like very

6452.719 --> 6457.199
prominent in their actions in their

6454.92 --> 6460.679
attitude it's like the thing of what

6457.199 --> 6463.28
it's about for them well a general

6460.679 --> 6466.119
Bard is like going to hear Flat Earth

6463.28 --> 6468.88
arguments and like sputter they like

6466.119 --> 6471.759999999999
they will be anxious and try to make

6468.88 --> 6475.04
excuses and try to puzzle it together so

6471.76 --> 6476.76
that they don't have to face that but

6475.04 --> 6477.88
then afterward like they'll just go back

6476.76 --> 6480.639
to

6477.88 --> 6483.639
normal right they don't really care

6480.639 --> 6486.92
about oh I'm better than you they just

6483.639 --> 6488.599
can't accept that it's not a ball and

6486.92 --> 6491.599
that's what makes you ball tarted it's

6488.599 --> 6491.599
not necessarily

6496.0 --> 6501.199
nasty trolls are trying to over

6498.44 --> 6504.879999999999
complicate coris

6501.199 --> 6508.0
yeah but I mean it's not strange

6504.88 --> 6511.2390000000005
though it's been inserted like for a

6508.0 --> 6514.48
long time globy

6511.239 --> 6517.959999999999
oldis which is by the way a phraseology

6514.48 --> 6520.799999999999
made up by Brian he gets that glob Allis

6517.96 --> 6524.4800000000005
is Brian's Brian's

6520.8 --> 6527.52
logic yeah I got the arnian Paradox but

6524.48 --> 6527.5199999999995
he's definitely got

6528.44 --> 6533.879999999999
globas but yeah I mean it's not strange

6532.0 --> 6536.8
that there is confusion about Corola

6533.88 --> 6540.4400000000005
since when you look it up on Wikipedia

6536.8 --> 6542.76
you get one little piece that's actually

6540.44 --> 6546.5199999999995
about coris effect and the rest is all

6542.76 --> 6550.0
globis nonsense so it's not strange that

6546.52 --> 6552.360000000001
people get confused all the

6550.0 --> 6555.48
time it's not

6552.36 --> 6557.5599999999995
strange because everywhere they go they

6555.48 --> 6562.119
get all the globi Allis

6557.56 --> 6562.119000000001
nonsense it's really hard

6568.28 --> 6573.719
Ryan's awesome but his hand up

6571.04 --> 6575.92
arguing I'm not arguing he's arguing

6573.719 --> 6575.92
with

6576.92 --> 6583.1990000000005
me I mean we get intellectual spats we

6580.32 --> 6585.5199999999995
get issues that I like to work out and

6583.199 --> 6588.08
then he just really gets agitated by

6585.52 --> 6593.040000000001
that starts ad homing me when I'm not

6588.08 --> 6593.04
doing that to him that's what happened

6596.719 --> 6602.599
Friday yeah I only get really angry if

6600.239 --> 6603.48
somebody's like clearly trying to censor

6602.599 --> 6607.08
me

6603.48 --> 6610.919999999999
by talking over

6607.08 --> 6613.92
me like by not accepting that what I

6610.92 --> 6617.679
have to say is really serious and

6613.92 --> 6619.84
informative and more than what's already

6617.679 --> 6623.4400000000005
happened so it's like I'm just not

6619.84 --> 6626.400000000001
getting the respect that's pisses me

6623.44 --> 6629.36
off

6626.4 --> 6631.239
right Ryan sometimes thinks I don't know

6629.36 --> 6633.679
why he does that to himself but he just

6631.239 --> 6634.5199999999995
thinks that I'm just doing it to get in

6633.679 --> 6637.679
his

6634.52 --> 6641.8
way when that's never the

6637.679 --> 6644.679
idea I'm a purist I'm like I'm a dual

6641.8 --> 6647.119000000001
cosmogonical purist I'm like no we have

6644.679 --> 6651.079
to get the flat we have to get the ball

6647.119 --> 6654.5599999999995
Earth mechanics right I have to keep C

6651.079 --> 6657.799999999999
iion so that I'll be able to attune to

6654.56 --> 6660.88
balard thinking and be able to basically

6657.8 --> 6663.0
emulated properly it's really important

6660.88 --> 6665.88
that it's all right that we don't go

6663.0 --> 6668.119
into any aberant directions with claims

6665.88 --> 6671.599
about the ball and that's what I'm

6668.119 --> 6674.159
worried about so this whole thing about

6671.599 --> 6676.360000000001
in a vacu according to the ball when if

6674.159 --> 6679.0
gas has weight then if there's no gas

6676.36 --> 6681.759999999999
then things should weigh less well

6679.0 --> 6684.92
that's high hyper

6681.76 --> 6687.719
theoretical which is technically correct

6684.92 --> 6691.4400000000005
it's just an exential consequence of a

6687.719 --> 6693.88
claim that doesn't really apply it only

6691.44 --> 6695.36
applies to them when they have to

6693.88 --> 6698.0
justify the gas pressure without a

6695.36 --> 6700.48
container situation you see that's the

6698.0 --> 6703.639
Dynamics of it that I understand so no

6700.48 --> 6705.678999999999
baller would ever say that yeah it

6703.639 --> 6708.96
should weigh less in a vacuum fi no

6705.679 --> 6710.4800000000005
baller's ever going to say

6708.96 --> 6713.719
that

6710.48 --> 6713.718999999999
and when I was in

6713.84 --> 6720.88
school they showed me it's like I asked

6717.159 --> 6723.4
them so if gas has weight and all

6720.88 --> 6725.679
that then what happens in the vacuum

6723.4 --> 6728.28
chamber like because when the air

6725.679 --> 6729.84
doesn't register on the scale does it

6728.28 --> 6733.04
like I was like that when I was a kid

6729.84 --> 6734.52
like but air doesn't weigh anything it's

6733.04 --> 6736.0
not on the scale and then they would

6734.52 --> 6738.88
explain yeah

6736.0 --> 6741.119
because it's just moving past

6738.88 --> 6743.719
it

6741.119 --> 6747.199
so that might have been a technically

6743.719 --> 6749.52
incorrect explanation back then but it

6747.199 --> 6751.239
didn't like solidifying me like no it's

6749.52 --> 6753.639
not a claim it's not a claim that

6751.239 --> 6755.5199999999995
Ballers actually make it's more like a

6753.639 --> 6759.4400000000005
logical

6755.52 --> 6761.76
consequence of how they reason out how

6759.44 --> 6764.36
it works when they're confronted with

6761.76 --> 6767.52
the gas pressure without a container

6764.36 --> 6769.28
argument but it's not actually the

6767.52 --> 6771.8
argumentation they give they're not

6769.28 --> 6774.599
actually willing to draw the full

6771.8 --> 6776.76
consequences of those

6774.599 --> 6779.599
conclusions they're not willing to carry

6776.76 --> 6781.360000000001
the weight of of the consequences and

6779.599 --> 6784.76
that's where Brian's coming in basically

6781.36 --> 6787.04
being a bit of a of a flat Earth bully

6784.76 --> 6789.639
just saying he yeah you that should be

6787.04 --> 6792.4
like that and I guess he's technically

6789.639 --> 6794.96
correct it's just that there's all the

6792.4 --> 6797.48
ballers in the world are condition to

6794.96 --> 6800.8
not accept that to say no no that's

6797.48 --> 6803.5599999999995
specifically not true I was told in

6800.8 --> 6807.0
school oh no that's specifically not

6803.56 --> 6809.280000000001
true you can't actually weigh the gas it

6807.0 --> 6812.239
might have weight but you can't weigh it

6809.28 --> 6815.28
on the scale the only way to weigh it is

6812.239 --> 6817.0
if you have the gas in a container and

6815.28 --> 6819.92
that put on the scale and if there's

6817.0 --> 6822.88
more gas in the container that you're

6819.92 --> 6825.2390000000005
weighing then you will see there's more

6822.88 --> 6827.679
weight to the whole container and that's

6825.239 --> 6830.119
how they reason it out and that's in all

6827.679 --> 6832.36
Ballers head that's why that

6830.119 --> 6834.679
argumentation is hyper theoretical what

6832.36 --> 6837.36
Brian tries to do and every time it's

6834.679 --> 6839.679
set there will be no baller that accepts

6837.36 --> 6843.4
it that will recognize it cuz they all

6839.679 --> 6844.32
have like yeah but whatever gas might

6843.4 --> 6847.0
have

6844.32 --> 6849.5199999999995
weight but you can't weigh it on the

6847.0 --> 6851.76
scale and that's a fact like there's no

6849.52 --> 6854.040000000001
influence on the

6851.76 --> 6856.52
scale like

6854.04 --> 6858.719
that and that's kind of the point that I

6856.52 --> 6861.1990000000005
was trying to make multiple times it's

6858.719 --> 6865.04
like the fifth time now

6861.199 --> 6867.239
last Friday and Brian's just like acting

6865.04 --> 6869.28
like I'm getting after him like I want

6867.239 --> 6871.759999999999
to ruin his point when that's not what I

6869.28 --> 6874.5199999999995
was doing any of the

6871.76 --> 6877.2390000000005
times simply pointing out like no that's

6874.52 --> 6881.84
not how the ball conditioning

6877.239 --> 6885.32
works you're mechanically correct but no

6881.84 --> 6888.56
baller will ever accept

6885.32 --> 6891.96
that and that was my point and he's just

6888.56 --> 6891.96
seems like Brian's just not

6893.76 --> 6899.92
interested right anyway hey blue pil

6896.96 --> 6899.92
Devolution good see

6905.159 --> 6912.44
you think stopped reading the Bible

6907.88 --> 6912.4400000000005
after reading of the exception of

6916.84 --> 6922.04
slavery yeah Gideon sick but I mean the

6919.28 --> 6924.639
Bible not whoa a ad

6922.04 --> 6926.88
again I'm getting all these ads on my

6924.639 --> 6929.88
own

6926.88 --> 6929.88
show

6936.32 --> 6940.88
huh yeah slavery was very different a

6939.239 --> 6943.36
lot of things were very different back

6940.88 --> 6947.079
then I mean back

6943.36 --> 6949.36
then you got married when you were a

6947.079 --> 6954.639
woman when you were eight a lot of the

6949.36 --> 6956.88
time not to to be ped squirt subject but

6954.639 --> 6960.8
because like that's how it worked it was

6956.88 --> 6963.0
very serious it wasn't even sexual right

6960.8 --> 6966.159000000001
yeah if you don't get that yeah then you

6963.0 --> 6968.84
don't understand that it does matter

6966.159 --> 6972.04
that it's a very different time period

6968.84 --> 6973.88
when this all took place like Jesus

6972.04 --> 6976.92
himself and what he taught is like one

6973.88 --> 6979.96
of the very very few

6976.92 --> 6981.84
exceptions that actually like really

6979.96 --> 6984.719
Cascades and Carries through to the

6981.84 --> 6984.719
Future and all the

6985.56 --> 6995.92
cultures right cuz what the hell even is

6993.079 --> 7001.079
slavery not having the

6995.92 --> 7001.079
option right so if you're

7001.719 --> 7009.0
like if isn't it slavery if like you do

7006.92 --> 7012.679
everything you're told and if you step

7009.0 --> 7016.36
out of it once you lose

7012.679 --> 7018.719
everything well you get the choice right

7016.36 --> 7021.28
but how is it that much different if you

7018.719 --> 7023.599
lose everything while a slave back then

7021.28 --> 7025.639
if they didn't do as they were told they

7023.599 --> 7029.28
were beaten with a

7025.639 --> 7031.639
stick which is actually arguably less

7029.28 --> 7032.92
painful than having all these things and

7031.639 --> 7034.159000000001
then you do things wrong and then you

7032.92 --> 7038.639
lose

7034.159 --> 7042.32
everything yeah so what the hell even is

7038.639 --> 7044.4400000000005
slavery then you know that's something

7042.32 --> 7046.4
you should really think about if you're

7044.44 --> 7050.119
going to make an argument oh byy what

7046.4 --> 7053.839999999999
slavery I can't agree with that oh yeah

7050.119 --> 7058.839999999999
do you actually understand what slavery

7053.84 --> 7061.1990000000005
is and what it's become how it's

7058.84 --> 7065.0
changed throughout

7061.199 --> 7068.04
history how it actually

7065.0 --> 7070.76
works and that what we're all so excited

7068.04 --> 7073.04
about is like an archaic type of slavery

7070.76 --> 7073.04
it's

7073.96 --> 7079.719
like that doesn't exist anymore slavery

7076.88 --> 7083.32
has become

7079.719 --> 7089.159
psychological and not based on physical

7083.32 --> 7092.48
punishment yeah and on financial

7089.159 --> 7096.28
dependency these are the forms in which

7092.48 --> 7097.799999999999
slavery manifest now it's just taken

7096.28 --> 7101.32
another

7097.8 --> 7101.320000000001
form with the

7103.59 --> 7106.649
[Music]

7108.8 --> 7114.52
consequences right so that's always

7111.88 --> 7116.76
important to keep in mind you're going

7114.52 --> 7119.4400000000005
to criticize the Bible over having

7116.76 --> 7119.4400000000005
slavery in

7121.239 --> 7124.239
it

7128.32 --> 7131.32
right

7133.639 --> 7137.599
all right anyway hope you are all

7135.04 --> 7137.599
enjoying the

7147.639 --> 7154.28
show I think it's been a great show that

7152.239 --> 7156.5199999999995
I'm really disappointed about flat zooid

7154.28 --> 7159.44
though I had really hoped that he would

7156.52 --> 7161.1990000000005
like Slide the other way again with but

7159.44 --> 7165.04
he seems to be really

7161.199 --> 7169.239
trashy I it's been disturbing

7165.04 --> 7173.0
me I find it disturbing about him and it

7169.239 --> 7178.48
seems that he's like insistent like

7173.0 --> 7181.28
no this is how I am this is what I like

7178.48 --> 7183.919999999999
he likes

7181.28 --> 7187.48
trash he likes trash

7183.92 --> 7187.4800000000005
people he likes

7188.239 --> 7193.879999999999
trashiness

7190.119 --> 7193.88
and so

7194.88 --> 7199.56
yeah what can you say you

7201.719 --> 7210.159
know except well white trash that's what

7206.239 --> 7210.159
that's called right white

7212.32 --> 7217.04
trash it's a loaded term these days

7215.119 --> 7219.96
because it's been highly

7217.04 --> 7223.92
politically loaded of course in many

7219.96 --> 7227.119
ways from different angles but I mean

7223.92 --> 7227.119
yeah you

7227.88 --> 7233.8
know I mean the only thing that's still

7230.76 --> 7233.8
missing is

7233.92 --> 7240.0
like flat side just having a copper pipe

7237.88 --> 7243.88
up his ass or something you know that's

7240.0 --> 7243.88
really all that's missing and it's just

7248.119 --> 7251.119
there

7267.4 --> 7274.36
yeah and it's kind of funny right me

7270.119 --> 7277.5199999999995
Arwin the poor social welfare

7274.36 --> 7279.92
guy with with emotional issues calling

7277.52 --> 7281.400000000001
somebody else white trash isn't that

7279.92 --> 7283.92
just funny I know a lot of people are

7281.4 --> 7287.839999999999
like oh how dare you are you're the

7283.92 --> 7288.88
white trash yeah well you know just

7287.84 --> 7292.96
because you're

7288.88 --> 7294.679
poor doesn't automatically mean you're

7292.96 --> 7298.04
trash

7294.679 --> 7299.84
yeah this is really more about what is

7298.04 --> 7304.56
your liking what do you like to hang

7299.84 --> 7308.639
around with how do you like to

7304.56 --> 7311.360000000001
act yeah that's the real thing it's not

7308.639 --> 7315.400000000001
how much much money you have there's

7311.36 --> 7315.4
white freaking trash that are

7320.52 --> 7327.599
rich

7323.0 --> 7327.599
yeah so that's not really how that

7330.44 --> 7333.839999999999
works H little

7337.96 --> 7340.96
shaggy

7341.48 --> 7347.239
right anyway support me don't support

7344.04 --> 7348.48
flat soid the troll promoting scumbag

7347.239 --> 7352.199
support

7348.48 --> 7355.759999999999
me my show I'm not going to bore you day

7352.199 --> 7358.4
in day out with stupid reviews of anti

7355.76 --> 7360.96
flat earthers that are reviewing me

7358.4 --> 7363.04
reviewing them because it's a [Â __Â ]

7360.96 --> 7364.96
waste of time and half of the time you

7363.04 --> 7367.639
don't even know what the [Â __Â ] they're

7364.96 --> 7367.639
talking about

7367.96 --> 7371.52
anymore

7370.119 --> 7374.598999999999
yeah

7371.52 --> 7378.360000000001
oh oh oh did I spill the beans did I

7374.599 --> 7380.8
just lift that Veil oh oh wait sorry I

7378.36 --> 7382.48
shouldn't have said that most of you

7380.8 --> 7384.1990000000005
probably don't can't even follow what

7382.48 --> 7386.48
the [Â __Â ] flat side's talking about

7384.199 --> 7389.638999999999
anymore because he's reviewing an anti

7386.48 --> 7392.119
flat earther reviewing himself reviewing

7389.639 --> 7393.52
that anti flat earther oh you don't know

7392.119 --> 7396.759999999999
what the [Â __Â ] they're talking about

7393.52 --> 7400.88
anymore who could have seen that coming

7396.76 --> 7400.88
you know yeah

7403.239 --> 7406.4
and that's why I don't do

7406.96 --> 7412.0
that because it just ends up being

7409.679 --> 7415.4
making noise and nobody understands what

7412.0 --> 7417.28
the [Â __Â ] the point even is anymore yeah

7415.4 --> 7419.239
that's what happens when you do that

7417.28 --> 7421.8
that's why I don't do that that's why I

7419.239 --> 7425.159
still have a show a Daily

7421.8 --> 7428.88
Show with almost 1,800

7425.159 --> 7430.679

7533.76 --> 7536.320000000001
tired

7536.92 --> 7542.1990000000005
though by then might be a little late

7540.36 --> 7543.119
but otherwise we'll just have a kind of

7542.199 --> 7546.44
a

7543.119 --> 7548.96
laidback talk I think we could do that I

7546.44 --> 7551.28
mean it doesn't have to be super serious

7548.96 --> 7553.0
right but if you guys just want to like

7551.28 --> 7555.639
ask me questions again about the dark

7553.0 --> 7557.84
world and all that I'm all for it I mean

7555.639 --> 7560.76
this sounds freaky but you could

7557.84 --> 7564.04
like I could probably like talk really

7560.76 --> 7566.320000000001
intensely for like 10 hours about that I

7564.04 --> 7568.48
can tell more than people will have

7566.32 --> 7571.32
energy to ask questions about

7568.48 --> 7573.879999999999
it so I'm always like wow somebody's

7571.32 --> 7579.679
actually asking questions about

7573.88 --> 7582.4800000000005
it h cuz rarely anybody does

7579.679 --> 7584.8
anyway so I'm looking forward to

7582.48 --> 7587.598999999999
that make sure to tune

7584.8 --> 7590.119000000001
in can you link up the channel

7587.599 --> 7592.2390000000005

7590.119 --> 7594.719
clutch the channel where it's going to

7592.239 --> 7594.718999999999
stream

7607.36 --> 7614.199
live yes duper pun and I appreciate you

7611.239 --> 7617.44
giving me a tip about

7614.199 --> 7617.44
that thank

7630.04 --> 7633.599
you oh not a

7634.04 --> 7640.5199999999995
motorcycle oh

7636.04 --> 7640.5199999999995
okay I thought hondai really only made

7640.96 --> 7644.719
motorcycles ride a bike for groceries

7643.119 --> 7650.0
and local

7644.719 --> 7652.44
oh oh so you you keep the motorcycle

7650.0 --> 7655.28
local so you don't go on highways and

7652.44 --> 7659.04
all that you don't go everywhere with it

7655.28 --> 7659.04
okay fair enough that's actually kind of

7659.159 --> 7665.679
wise although it's going to like not be

7662.159 --> 7668.719
super strong then because it's just like

7665.679 --> 7670.84
a doctor's car it used to be a thing

7668.719 --> 7674.32
like if you just drive a short way with

7670.84 --> 7677.0
a car eventually it's going to like be

7674.32 --> 7678.04
very weak the motor is going to be weak

7677.0 --> 7680.48
that's going to happen to your

7678.04 --> 7682.4
motorcycle too if you don't give it an

7680.48 --> 7684.959999999999
opportunity to just go

7682.4 --> 7688.079
full right if you never do that the

7684.96 --> 7691.32
motor is going to like weaken over time

7688.079 --> 7691.32
just keep that in

7693.599 --> 7698.96
mind right sometimes you got to unleash

7696.28 --> 7702.04
to like clear up the motor

7698.96 --> 7705.04
it's going to it has to get

7702.04 --> 7705.04
hot

7705.92 --> 7714.04
anyway hey two wolf77 you called out J

7792.76 --> 7796.360000000001
expedi Expedition truth just said blue

7795.32 --> 7799.36
build

7796.36 --> 7799.36
Evolution

7800.639 --> 7806.96
thanks pedling bike this called a

7804.04 --> 7809.28
bicycle yeah just a regular bicycle

7806.96 --> 7812.4
pedling bike what the [Â __Â ] is that

7809.28 --> 7815.679
supposed to be that sounds like a a

7812.4 --> 7815.679
little kids

7817.239 --> 7820.239
bike

7831.239 --> 7837.598999999999
what she was in the chat someone oh my

7834.52 --> 7840.88
God not that hor [Â __Â ]

7837.599 --> 7844.28
again that's why Arwin plays close

7840.88 --> 7846.159000000001
attention plays close attention to

7844.28 --> 7848.88
who to

7846.159 --> 7851.48
REI I don't even freaking watch your

7848.88 --> 7853.4800000000005
videos I'm not unsubscribed yet I kind

7851.48 --> 7855.598999999999
of like want to see through the title

7853.48 --> 7857.839999999999
like what is she going after but I don't

7855.599 --> 7861.119000000001
even watch your videos I don't think

7857.84 --> 7863.8
that she's a dude I don't [Â __Â ] care

7861.119 --> 7863.799999999999
if she's a

7865.239 --> 7872.199
dude oh my God I made that stupid joke

7869.239 --> 7875.4
one time remember in raie made that

7872.199 --> 7879.199
video of me of me just chewing there and

7875.4 --> 7883.879999999999
then like oh she was on cam oh she's not

7879.199 --> 7887.48
a dude oh okay that's it and now

7883.88 --> 7891.52
everybody Harwin is trying obsessed I

7887.48 --> 7894.5199999999995
think ra is a dude except though that

7891.52 --> 7896.96
that video is like oh you got her in cam

7894.52 --> 7898.079000000001
oh okay so I guess she's really a woman

7896.96 --> 7901.36
after

7898.079 --> 7901.36
all that's

7907.159 --> 7910.239
it

7908.719 --> 7913.04
okay what the hell is

7910.239 --> 7915.5199999999995
this ra is going back and forth with

7913.04 --> 7915.5199999999995
flat

7917.88 --> 7922.36
soid I don't want to have anything to do

7920.199 --> 7922.36
with

7930.76 --> 7940.079000000001
it bicyle Riders are in great shape

7936.0 --> 7940.079
yeah that's right

7942.96 --> 7951.079
and riding a bike is better for you than

7946.239 --> 7953.44
jogging by the way yeah because it

7951.079 --> 7957.04
doesn't damage your knees that much and

7953.44 --> 7957.04
it doesn't burden your back as

7959.92 --> 7964.84
much but if you do it right you can like

7962.679 --> 7967.0
make a very serious workout with riding

7964.84 --> 7967.0
a

7967.04 --> 7971.559
bicycle

7969.36 --> 7973.839999999999
indeed less impact that's right which is

7971.559 --> 7975.719
like well when you're young you're like

7973.84 --> 7978.079
whatever well when you get older yeah

7975.719 --> 7980.079
it's going to matter it is going to

7978.079 --> 7984.199
matter right and that's why you don't

7980.079 --> 7986.719
see a lot of like jogging 60y olds but

7984.199 --> 7988.32
you do see plenty of 60y old on a

7986.719 --> 7992.159
bicycle

7988.32 --> 7994.32
though at least I do out there because

7992.159 --> 7994.32
they

7995.239 --> 7998.759999999999
know and you're not shaking your organs

7997.559 --> 8001.400000000001
around yeah

7998.76 --> 8004.2390000000005
yeah although shaking your organs around

8001.4 --> 8005.879999999999
is actually kind of useful it's not bad

8004.239 --> 8008.28
to do

8005.88 --> 8010.639
that right the shaking the organs around

8008.28 --> 8014.48
is actually kind of good because it gets

8010.639 --> 8017.0
things flowing and all that but the

8014.48 --> 8020.759999999999
shock absorption of the knees and the

8017.0 --> 8020.76
back that's really the

8023.96 --> 8029.96
problem which you by the way also get on

8026.44 --> 8029.96
a threadmill

8030.84 --> 8035.360000000001
because the shock is literally you

8033.159 --> 8036.638999999999
absorbing the shock of your body on your

8035.36 --> 8039.199
back and your

8036.639 --> 8040.639
knees that's just a fact you can avoid

8039.199 --> 8043.239
that even in on a

8040.639 --> 8046.400000000001
threadmill but you do bypass it

8043.239 --> 8046.4
completely if you use a

8046.48 --> 8049.48
bicycle

8056.88 --> 8059.88
anyway

8064.36 --> 8067.28
that coffee was

8071.96 --> 8076.8
great same reason why swimming is good

8074.599 --> 8080.360000000001
yeah

8076.8 --> 8082.8
sure although swimming

8080.36 --> 8085.719
yeah all depends on what you're swimming

8082.8 --> 8086.88
in you know like chlorine water is not

8085.719 --> 8089.119
great for

8086.88 --> 8092.1990000000005
you

8089.119 --> 8096.199
but I mean it's doing actual Sports

8092.199 --> 8099.558999999999
swimming in salt water is kind of rare

8096.199 --> 8104.04
but is much better salt water is much

8099.559 --> 8107.119000000001
better for you than chlorine in

8104.04 --> 8110.92
water but it tends to also be more

8107.119 --> 8110.92
expensive to maintain

8116.8 --> 8119.8
that

8121.159 --> 8127.96
writing also releases endorphin yeah but

8123.88 --> 8127.96
any sports typically does

8134.28 --> 8140.5199999999995
that but yes I found out that it is

8137.28 --> 8143.84
really like for me it's specifically

8140.52 --> 8147.040000000001
like my calfs I think the the muscles of

8143.84 --> 8150.360000000001
my upper leg the back muscles there's

8147.04 --> 8153.199
like a real endorphin trigger with that

8150.36 --> 8154.839999999999
and I even kind of like use it I I

8153.199 --> 8160.0
basically

8154.84 --> 8163.0
like trigger it on purpose when I go

8160.0 --> 8165.079
sleeping it's like you just like go back

8163.0 --> 8166.639
and forth with those muscles not like

8165.079 --> 8169.04
with strain on it but just back and

8166.639 --> 8172.079
forth and it like hamstring is that

8169.04 --> 8175.44
hamstring isn't that like the the lower

8172.079 --> 8178.5199999999995
leg I'm not sure but it's like my upper

8175.44 --> 8180.96
back muscle back of your upper leg

8178.52 --> 8182.88
and like there's a serious endorphine

8180.96 --> 8185.8
trigger

8182.88 --> 8189.159000000001
there under the right circumstances like

8185.8 --> 8193.24
it can like it's almost like a heroin

8189.159 --> 8195.8
pump but not one that gets you

8193.24 --> 8199.24
sick but like in the mornings it's

8195.8 --> 8201.759999999998
really strong so it's like oh I'm

8199.24 --> 8206.08
sleeping uh and it just like oh move it

8201.76 --> 8206.08
around a bit and just Doge back

8206.519 --> 8212.679
in right so there's

8209.28 --> 8216.599
that I learned that trick very

8212.679 --> 8219.24
young it's like oh oh I need the I need

8216.599 --> 8222.719000000001
the morphine pump what do you mean I got

8219.24 --> 8226.359
a muscle at the bag of my leg I can just

8222.719 --> 8228.8
freaking endorphin Pump It Just Like

8226.359 --> 8231.399000000001
That Just

8228.8 --> 8233.319
internally and I mean it's not a joke I

8231.399 --> 8237.88
literally can do

8233.319 --> 8242.399
that and I've even Managed IT like get

8237.88 --> 8242.399
through very serious tooth AE with

8259.719 --> 8264.399
it right in road bike

8264.679 --> 8270.599
H just go out too much that's

8272.84 --> 8278.92
okay I have just a regular shitty bike

8276.519 --> 8281.960000000001
it's look shitty

8278.92 --> 8284.319
it's it looks like it like could like

8281.96 --> 8285.919999999998
fall down and fall into multiple pieces

8284.319 --> 8289.76
at any

8285.92 --> 8289.76
second but it still

8292.559 --> 8296.518999999998
works until it doesn't and then I have

8295.399 --> 8299.519
to fix

8296.519 --> 8299.519
it

8301.679 --> 8305.359
yeah but at least the way it's looking

8303.96 --> 8307.839999999998
it's never going to get

8305.359 --> 8309.439
stolen like literally somebody that

8307.84 --> 8311.12
would be considering I'm might steal

8309.439 --> 8312.08
this bike and if they look at it they'd

8311.12 --> 8315.08
be

8312.08 --> 8317.84
like yeah I could try to steal that but

8315.08 --> 8319.96
there's a big chance it it'll literally

8317.84 --> 8321.679
like break up and then I'll get into a

8319.96 --> 8326.399
terrible accident have like part of the

8321.679 --> 8328.84
bike piercing me right so that makes it

8326.399 --> 8331.88
less appealing to people that think oh

8328.84 --> 8335.08
yeah I could just steal that yeah

8331.88 --> 8337.199999999999
no now I know this bike I know how to

8335.08 --> 8338.639
avoid these types of risks but as

8337.2 --> 8341.519
somebody who doesn't know that bike

8338.639 --> 8343.598999999998
you're going to look at it and feel like

8341.519 --> 8346.319
I could get in an accident with that

8343.599 --> 8350.08
thing and that's good because that means

8346.319 --> 8350.08
nobody is ever going to steal

8356.439 --> 8359.439
it

8359.92 --> 8364.04
got mine used yeah mine too dude I had

8362.76 --> 8368.0
to

8364.04 --> 8370.080000000002
like replace the entire brake system

8368.0 --> 8372.679
like a year ago or two I don't remember

8370.08 --> 8375.2
exactly when because it was completely

8372.679 --> 8379.12
worn out and like the guy from the

8375.2 --> 8381.679
bicycle shop had to like secondhand

8379.12 --> 8383.399000000001
find that type of brakes because it's

8381.679 --> 8385.12
like a very old type of bike and they

8383.399 --> 8388.08
don't they're not even made

8385.12 --> 8390.880000000001
anymore like that's how shitty old my

8388.08 --> 8393.84
bike is like it has parts that aren't

8390.88 --> 8393.839999999998
even being produced

8394.12 --> 8400.12
anymore it's like an a bike from the 80s

8397.92 --> 8400.12
or

8400.24 --> 8406.199999999999
something but it still works right in

8403.399 --> 8410.399
the meantime there's all these new fat

8406.2 --> 8412.92
steel bikes with the stupid broad

8410.399 --> 8415.519999999999
tires and those are really expensive and

8412.92 --> 8417.84
they're all the rage now and all the all

8415.52 --> 8420.319000000001
those younger people are riding it's

8417.84 --> 8423.6
such a yepy

8420.319 --> 8427.199999999999
thing I'm just riding the shitty old

8423.6 --> 8427.2
bikes so many of

8428.53 --> 8434.68
[Music]

8431.16 --> 8437.24
them that's right yeah because those

8434.68 --> 8441.399
newer bikes with the fat tires those

8437.24 --> 8444.119999999999
things are like really theft prone cuz

8441.399 --> 8445.68
they are expensive and everybody all the

8444.12 --> 8448.319000000001
bike thieves they all know that those

8445.68 --> 8451.52
are expensive people don't never Park

8448.319 --> 8453.279999999999
those outside you can't even fit them by

8451.52 --> 8456.359
the way with the stupid broad tires you

8453.28 --> 8460.2
can't even fit them in bicycle

8456.359 --> 8462.399000000001
parking thingies right you can't even

8460.2 --> 8464.800000000001
get them so everybody that has those

8462.399 --> 8466.479
bikes they always like oh you have to

8464.8 --> 8469.039999999999
park them

8466.479 --> 8471.479
indoor because otherwise they get

8469.04 --> 8475.960000000001
stolen I don't have that issue I can

8471.479 --> 8475.96
park my bike anywhere and nobody gives a

8476.24 --> 8479.24
[Â __Â ]

8483.16 --> 8488.439
anyway I think I'm going to round out

8485.96 --> 8490.72
the show

8488.439 --> 8492.399
somewhere it's getting dark and I still

8490.72 --> 8496.56
have to get my

8492.399 --> 8496.56
rice for my meal later

8506.24 --> 8509.24

I hope you have all enjoyed the

8514.52 --> 8520.359
show please support me I'm going to ask

8518.04 --> 8520.359

again there are supplements that I

8522.8 --> 8528.279999999999
really want but they are expensive I

8525.84 --> 8530.12
could just sort of like force it on you

8528.28 --> 8531.319000000001
or whatever and just say like oh I'm

8530.12 --> 8532.76
just going to order it and then I'm

8531.319 --> 8534.76
going to be short and then I'm going to

8532.76 --> 8536.16
beg for money because of that it's like

8534.76 --> 8540.76
help me I need

8536.16 --> 8545.64
food it's just that I would really just

8540.76 --> 8549.2
like the support more up front so

8545.64 --> 8550.76
I I don't want to force it you see I

8549.2 --> 8552.800000000001
could just say like oh [Â __Â ] you I'm

8550.76 --> 8555.04
going to all order all these

8552.8 --> 8557.479
things cuz it's smarter and then I'm

8555.04 --> 8559.560000000001
going to be short and then I'm going to

8557.479 --> 8562.84
basically blame you for not supporting

8559.56 --> 8562.84
me I don't want to do

8566.16 --> 8569.16
that

8572.01 --> 8591.609
[Music]

8595.76 --> 8600.56
