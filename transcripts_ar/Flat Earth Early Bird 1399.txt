though

109.38 --> 113.52
yeah there's a bit of blue sky here and

111.96 --> 117.32
there but

113.52 --> 117.32
there's also lots of clouds

117.78 --> 123.479
and there's trails

120.659 --> 127.259
you can even see it in the blue part in

123.479 --> 130.399
the sky there's been a lot of trails

127.259 --> 130.399
being dropped today

131.34 --> 136.28
right but no rain yet at least so

139.319 --> 142.33999999999997
plenty of wind

142.68 --> 149.04000000000002
look at how quickly the yeah the color

146.099 --> 151.14

149.04 --> 154.26
leaves falling and noticed

151.14 --> 156.17999999999998
I'm going to go for groceries some trees

154.26 --> 158.34

156.18 --> 159.72
dropped all their leaves

hello jado first in chat Elise G Mike

188.28 --> 195.06
zadunich good to see you all

191.22 --> 196.28
it is Friday the 21 first

195.06 --> 200.0
the

196.28 --> 201.78
21st of October 2022

200.0 --> 206.0
[Music]

201.78 --> 206.0
uh AP just seen it

206.34 --> 209.94
right so yeah starting late today

208.68 --> 211.92000000000002
because

209.94 --> 214.98
well not because I woke up right before

211.92 --> 218.17999999999998
when I should be doing the show but

214.98 --> 218.17999999999998
no just

218.22 --> 222.84
felt really good then it went up for

221.099 --> 225.599
groceries

222.84 --> 227.879
and then I think I like I got too hungry

225.599 --> 229.67999999999998
and then wasn't actually able to eat

227.879 --> 234.85999999999999
right away and that like really

229.68 --> 234.86
backfired so I got this massive cramp

236.34 --> 241.26
that took like 45 minutes before it was

239.22 --> 243.68
doable I was actually gonna skip the

241.26 --> 243.67999999999998
show today

244.44 --> 250.2
but yeah then it faded out anyway and I

247.14 --> 253.82
thought okay I'll just do a half a show

250.2 --> 253.82
[Music]

260.22 --> 264.47900000000004
anyway

261.66 --> 267.02000000000004
how are you guys doing hope I hope

264.479 --> 267.02
you're doing better

267.06 --> 271.979
than me

269.759 --> 275.40000000000003
so yeah also

271.979 --> 277.199
good to hear that apparently the uh

275.4 --> 279.59999999999997
one of my roommates the one that I

277.199 --> 282.3
actually really like

279.6 --> 285.12
is suddenly moving away

282.3 --> 287.47
and that's a real bummer I think

285.12 --> 290.869
it's like a little moving right now

287.47 --> 290.869
[Music]

291.66 --> 295.97900000000004
I had to do with like the costs

293.58 --> 298.34
apparently she found a cheaper place

295.979 --> 298.34
that

298.68 --> 304.549
yeah that's where she's gonna go

301.42 --> 304.54900000000004
[Music]

305.759 --> 311.759
but yeah I'm gonna miss her that's she's

309.479 --> 314.84
a really awesome person

311.759 --> 314.84000000000003
awesome to have around

315.24 --> 317.479
foreign

337.04 --> 343.07
[Music]

339.86 --> 346.32
what happened in 2018

343.07 --> 346.32
[Music]

369.5 --> 375.72
all right but hey jado let me give you

373.199 --> 378.66
another perspective on it

375.72 --> 382.68
do you think maybe that

378.66 --> 385.74
the Flat Earth was simply let let out of

382.68 --> 388.52
the bag on the internet

385.74 --> 388.52
for a bit

388.58 --> 394.21999999999997
because they knew all this stuff was

391.919 --> 394.21999999999997
coming

394.68 --> 401.28000000000003
to snow it under anyway

399.06 --> 403.639
if you ever thought of thought of it

401.28 --> 403.63899999999995
like that

411.18 --> 418.779
protest wef really back then okay

415.55 --> 418.779
[Music]

420.82 --> 424.019
[Music]

427.86 --> 431.41900000000004
[Music]

429.3 --> 431.41900000000004
thank you

431.84 --> 449.09999999999997
[Music]

452.58 --> 457.34
well today nah I'm okay I just

457.38 --> 461.599
gotta like this

459.66 --> 464.759
some

461.599 --> 466.919
cramps attack

464.759 --> 469.62
when I would normally start the show so

466.919 --> 473.28
that's why I'm starting an hour late it

469.62 --> 474.62
was pretty bad but yeah I'm okay other

473.28 --> 477.81899999999996
than that I'm fine

474.62 --> 477.819
[Music]

490.259 --> 492.5
foreign

499.62 --> 502.879
[Music]

502.979 --> 510.3
yeah but it's kind of weird to say that

505.919 --> 514.4399999999999
all these meticulously planned agendas

510.3 --> 517.02
were specifically rolled out as a live

514.44 --> 519.9590000000001
response to the Flat Earth

517.02 --> 521.8199999999999
being revealed

519.959 --> 524.6999999999999
I think it's the other way around really

521.82 --> 526.32
I think that these this stuff had been

524.7 --> 529.6400000000001
in the books

526.32 --> 529.6400000000001
for decades

530.94 --> 534.839
and

532.14 --> 537.24
that might be the reason why they

534.839 --> 539.82
thought oh yeah sure Flat Earth on the

537.24 --> 542.1800000000001
internet who gives a [ __ ] doesn't matter

539.82 --> 542.1800000000001
anymore

543.06 --> 547.8599999999999
people are going to be too busy with

545.76 --> 551.06
these things that were in the books for

547.86 --> 551.0600000000001
so long anyway

551.07 --> 555.9590000000001
[Music]

552.959 --> 555.959
oh

557.459 --> 562.6199999999999
bladder yeah that well

560.04 --> 566.24
well that's just painful orinocobombo

562.62 --> 570.0
that's not what I that ails me

566.24 --> 572.36
no it's just intestines and it has to do

570.0 --> 572.36
with

575.04 --> 581.5999999999999
I'm not entirely sure

577.86 --> 581.6
might have to do with like

582.06 --> 587.399
when I'm hungry

583.62 --> 590.64
and then I get like in a in a rush it's

587.399 --> 592.459
like when I'm hungry and I and I do

590.64 --> 597.8
like sports

592.459 --> 597.8
that sometimes has this reaction

597.959 --> 602.18
to be kind of careful to balance that

600.0 --> 602.18
out

602.82 --> 607.74
in this case I think it just went I was

605.279 --> 610.74
so hungry I was like ah I want my

607.74 --> 614.6
Illuminati Castle right now

610.74 --> 614.6
almost as soon as I woke up

614.76 --> 620.279
but yeah I can't eat it until I'm all

618.18 --> 622.8199999999999
the way back

620.279 --> 622.82
so

624.3 --> 628.3199999999999
um

624.899 --> 629.94
anyway not very super not riveting

628.32 --> 633.019
information

629.94 --> 633.019
[Music]

634.26 --> 636.3199999999999
um

641.15 --> 650.889
[Music]

655.38 --> 663.38
all right yeah but yeah though

657.72 --> 663.38
look I think it's more likely that

663.779 --> 669.72
World economic forum and all that has

666.12 --> 672.3
been set up in response to the

669.72 --> 673.9200000000001
Occupy Wall Street

672.3 --> 676.5
movement

673.92 --> 678.959
which was a little before the flatter of

676.5 --> 682.92
the Awakening actually but that thing

678.959 --> 686.459
had a much wider impact and it really

682.92 --> 689.24
changed the minds of like the the more

686.459 --> 692.9399999999999
common folk right

689.24 --> 695.7
that's dangerous that's when basically

692.94 --> 699.0
the the Sheep suddenly start to form

695.7 --> 700.86
their own Collective you see that's what

699.0 --> 703.86
they're actually much more afraid of

700.86 --> 706.019
than flat earthers breaking people out

703.86 --> 708.6800000000001
of Dreams

706.019 --> 708.68
of space

709.74 --> 712.5790000000001
so if anything

713.7 --> 717.32
it was a response to that

722.76 --> 727.98
they stepped up their space fancy really

725.76 --> 730.3389999999999
you think so

727.98 --> 730.339
how

736.92 --> 740.899
I mean not really

742.56 --> 748.3199999999999
there's just more

744.839 --> 750.7790000000001
kind of like rocket stuff

748.32 --> 753.4200000000001
but there was a lot of that even like

750.779 --> 756.48
well in the 70s and in the 80s and all

753.42 --> 757.74
that like during that time there was a

756.48 --> 760.2
lot of it

757.74 --> 764.779
so it's just been brought back

760.2 --> 764.779
I guess because of some popular demand

765.42 --> 771.7199999999999
and yeah of course the CGI has vastly

768.779 --> 774.5
improved but that's been going on for

771.72 --> 774.5
quite a while anyway

776.7 --> 780.98
a refracted curvature let's see you

787.92 --> 792.899
right but PG seen it when you say they

790.44 --> 796.019
stepped up their space fantasy

792.899 --> 797.19
I have a tendency to say no not really

796.019 --> 799.5600000000001
not that much

797.19 --> 802.0790000000001
[Music]

799.56 --> 804.779
I think that I personally have probably

802.079 --> 807.4399999999999
stepped up the space fantasy more than

804.779 --> 807.4399999999999
they have

808.579 --> 813.5
as Baldwin

811.019 --> 813.5
anyway

815.779 --> 821.18
yeah

817.5 --> 821.18
okay so there's some projects

827.279 --> 834.12
it's not really up their game it's just

829.8 --> 834.12
doing it again right

834.48 --> 839.3000000000001
it's not that's not upping the game it's

836.94 --> 842.59
just playing the same game again

839.3 --> 842.5899999999999
[Music]

854.76 --> 858.409
[Music]

859.68 --> 864.8389999999999
I don't know any movement with that name

862.38 --> 870.139
jedo

864.839 --> 870.139
well Jeff gas had low combo virus

870.25 --> 873.389
[Music]

874.5 --> 877.8
hey he's taking storm water it's been a

876.48 --> 880.5790000000001
while

877.8 --> 880.579
how are you doing

882.3 --> 889.199
are you settling the the new place

886.5 --> 892.88
yet because you were moving like the

889.199 --> 892.88
last time I heard of you

903.23 --> 908.019
[Music]

915.8 --> 922.519
in our earlier time zone

919.8 --> 922.519

938.339 --> 941.339
80306

942.959 --> 945.56
foreign

946.579 --> 950.66
you moved an hour

951.6 --> 958.44
you mean not the clock

954.68 --> 961.8199999999999
you actually and where you live moved an

958.44 --> 961.82
hour is that what you mean

972.24 --> 983.62
right right

973.61 --> 983.62

986.64 --> 997.8199999999999

1006.5 --> 1009.04
thank you

1016.82 --> 1022.399
a French defraid to launch Artemis no

1019.94 --> 1025.4
Artemis is Never Gonna launch

1022.399 --> 1027.319
it's one of those things

1025.4 --> 1028.459
it's one of those things that's just

1027.319 --> 1031.28
like this

1028.459 --> 1033.5
it's a dream box it's like a thing

1031.28 --> 1038.319
that's too big

1033.5 --> 1038.319
right Artemis is just too freaking big

1038.419 --> 1045.0790000000002
but that plays into the

1042.14 --> 1046.939
uh yeah all the space engineer fantasies

1045.079 --> 1048.799
that's like oh how big would it have to

1046.939 --> 1051.5
be to go that far and so they're all

1048.799 --> 1053.12
fantasizing oh it's going so far but

1051.5 --> 1054.2
that thing's never gonna come off the

1053.12 --> 1055.76
ground

1054.2 --> 1059.799
I don't think it's even actually

1055.76 --> 1059.799
properly designed to be able to

1060.26 --> 1063.4
it's too big

1065.299 --> 1071.6
like it's not actually gonna work

1067.96 --> 1074.179
so it's just there to be a Sitting Duck

1071.6 --> 1076.9399999999998
and like pull in people like oh yeah the

1074.179 --> 1080.0
big the big one is the big are they

1076.94 --> 1081.98
finally going to send in the big one no

1080.0 --> 1083.9
no they're not that thing's never gonna

1081.98 --> 1086.98
come off the ground

1083.9 --> 1086.98
it's my prediction

1088.52 --> 1093.86
I mean that thing might still be sitting

1091.46 --> 1096.44
there in like a hundred years and it

1093.86 --> 1100.6
might just be a monument as to like

1096.44 --> 1100.6000000000001
that's the spaceship that never went

1105.799 --> 1109.6
that thing's never gonna come off the

1107.48 --> 1109.6
ground

1114.02 --> 1118.7
what

1115.82 --> 1121.28
but when seeking star when did was

1118.7 --> 1123.82
Haley's Comet visible for 10 days in the

1121.28 --> 1123.82
past what

1128.75 --> 1131.829
[Music]

1147.34 --> 1153.1999999999998
right and by the way concerning this

1150.5 --> 1156.38
space start I don't know

1153.2 --> 1159.2
I I'm pretty sure they they did actually

1156.38 --> 1160.88
show the space that thing like on every

1159.2 --> 1162.8600000000001
television

1160.88 --> 1165.2600000000002
it's just that

1162.86 --> 1167.24
almost nobody that actually matters

1165.26 --> 1170.84
watch television anymore

1167.24 --> 1172.88
right so to us it's like oh yeah

from preliminaries from people that it's

1207.62 --> 1211.4599999999998
too big

1209.36 --> 1215.1399999999999

1211.46 --> 1215.14

1215.36 --> 1221.4799999999998
you build something that's too big

the most effective thing for a covert

1520.34 --> 1526.6999999999998
balloon setup is well a rocket that's

1523.4 --> 1528.26
just has a huge volume and very little

1526.7 --> 1530.8400000000001
surface

1528.26 --> 1533.179
and then instead of stuff

1530.84 --> 1536.5
and supposed Rocket Fuel being in there

1533.179 --> 1536.5
there's just helium

1539.779 --> 1545.72
and well a much smaller rocket engine

1542.96 --> 1548.6000000000001
with less fuel which is a lot less

1545.72 --> 1550.279
weight and then yeah it'll get it off

1548.6 --> 1551.8999999999999
the ground

1550.279 --> 1555.02
long enough

1551.9 --> 1556.46
long enough to be seen like as if it is

1555.02 --> 1558.3799999999999
a rocket launch

1556.46 --> 1561.02
until it falls down because it doesn't

actually need to reach those distances

it will get delayed again dude I put

1632.299 --> 1636.279
does that have to know akumu virus

1640.6 --> 1646.34
it's not literally like a balloon like

1644.419 --> 1649.159
Rocket Balloons are still being

1646.34 --> 1652.58
propelled by a rocket they just don't

1649.159 --> 1655.96
have actual weight in them and instead

1652.58 --> 1655.96
are filled by helium

1656.26 --> 1662.539
like without the rocket It's Not Really

1659.539 --> 1664.34
Gonna Fly Away it's kind of probably

1662.539 --> 1666.62
gonna hover

1664.34 --> 1669.08
right it still requires the rocket to

1666.62 --> 1674.8899999999999
propel itself

never gonna come off the ground if you

when they're done with it

1830.96 --> 1835.1000000000001
I mean I think that that thing is

1832.82 --> 1837.5
probably at this point just gonna keep

1835.1 --> 1840.6999999999998
going no matter what like even if it

1837.5 --> 1840.7
makes no more sense

I mean it's it is basically just a

it effectively costs nothing to them to

decided to just blow it up and then

2014.74 --> 2020.559
in response if the funding is there they

2017.559 --> 2024.22

2521.44 --> 2527.68
footage and you have to wait a decade

2524.619 --> 2529.7200000000003
for me before they can show you that

2527.68 --> 2531.48
means they built it in a studio

2529.72 --> 2534.22
afterwards

2531.48 --> 2536.47
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] if you don't

they was waiting on how it's made yeah

time when it was still watching

2593.859 --> 2598.06
television

2595.72 --> 2601.98

2607.89 --> 2623.519
[Music]

2628.18 --> 2632.7999999999997
all right but I'm sure they got it now I

2631.06 --> 2633.7599999999998
mean well I'm sure a day after footage

2632.8 --> 2636.7000000000003
now

2633.76 --> 2639.3390000000004
but yeah obviously that's not the

2636.7 --> 2642.64
footage then because what is it 20 years

2639.339 --> 2645.16
later now something like that

2642.64 --> 2650.6189999999997
so it's ridiculous

2645.16 --> 2653.5789999999997
there's no excuse for that if it's real

2650.619 --> 2653.579
which it isn't

2653.92 --> 2658.9
if it's real

2655.66 --> 2660.0989999999997
then you can literally show the complete

2658.9 --> 2662.73
footage

2660.099 --> 2664.48
like within a month

2662.73 --> 2667.619
[Music]

2664.48 --> 2667.619
after it's done

2669.339 --> 2675.88

in which all those years there were a

2675.88 --> 2681.2200000000003
massive amount of people being very

2677.92 --> 2684.52
impatient and angry

skeptical but why the hell aren't you

2684.52 --> 2691.18
why are you not sharing this footage you

2688.42 --> 2693.46
don't have any this is ridiculous

2691.18 --> 2696.5789999999997
yeah you not made yourself Popular by

2693.46 --> 2699.7
doing that if it were real which it is

2696.579 --> 2701.94
it even if it were real then it makes no

2699.7 --> 2701.9399999999996

if they have a live feed from the Moon

2744.819 --> 2750.16
in 1969

2747.339 --> 2754.2

screens surrounding them

3196.079 --> 3202.38

3199.02 --> 3205.14

3229.14 --> 3234.66
them ready to go

3231.78 --> 3239.2200000000003
I mean these people spend

3234.66 --> 3242.0
hours sometimes in just prepping sock

3239.22 --> 3242.0
libraries

3242.46 --> 3246.54
prepping it getting it all ready to

3244.619 --> 3248.52
switch to the next to switch to the next

3246.54 --> 3250.5589999999997
and do it quickly right

3248.52 --> 3253.64
they prep for that this is not something

3250.559 --> 3257.52
that just comes free there's no

3253.64 --> 3260.52
ultimate troll program bro

3257.52 --> 3262.38
just oh you click a button and you got a

3260.52 --> 3265.2
new stock account ready to go no no no

3262.38 --> 3267.599
they actually have to prep that

3265.2 --> 3269.22
and they do that because they have no

3267.599 --> 3271.92
life

3269.22 --> 3274.5
because they don't have any actual

3271.92 --> 3276.3
people to talk to in real life to

3274.5 --> 3278.28
develop their own social skill and

3276.3 --> 3281.099
dynamic and identity

3278.28 --> 3284.1600000000003
because they're despicable and gross and

3281.099 --> 3289.619
irredeemable and people avoid them

3284.16 --> 3289.6189999999997
so they instead develop this ta-da

3328.579 --> 3334.319

3346.8 --> 3353.48
this moment to just subtly jump in

3372.24 --> 3379.04
Olga vs troll what's the difference

3374.22 --> 3379.04

3381.66 --> 3388.2599999999998
ogres are usually just really strong

3384.66 --> 3392.16
ogres are just very strong

3388.26 --> 3394.3390000000004
trolls are super tenacious that's the

3392.16 --> 3394.339
difference

3396.24 --> 3403.1899999999996
right you got to use acid or fire to

3400.74 --> 3404.4599999999996

not cool it's really annoying

3438.119 --> 3442.2200000000003
in the game this is

3442.5 --> 3446.04
but trolls are very interesting

3444.54 --> 3447.9
opponents though

3446.04 --> 3450.48
they're a good challenge

3447.9 --> 3452.46
I really liked using trolls in my

3450.48 --> 3456.839
dungeon dragons campaigns

3452.46 --> 3461.54
and I call my Dungeons and Dragons book

3456.839 --> 3461.54
trolls and tyrants so yeah
