master Salim yeah yeah I do feel better

154.459 --> 161.03
today I already kind of said that but

156.799 --> 166.639
that's okay because yeah I didn't come

161.03 --> 170.769
back yesterday got a nervous about and I

166.639 --> 170.769
do feel better it's still a bit

171.489 --> 179.269
it doesn't feel raw anymore it's like it

174.799 --> 180.139
just feels a bit woozy no like I don't

179.269 --> 183.439
know

180.139 --> 185.169
yeah but feeling better I did get a good

183.439 --> 188.5
night's sleep

185.169 --> 191.93
yesterday evening though and night for

188.5 --> 197.409
there was a lot of good activity on

191.93 --> 197.40900000000002
YouTube and on D live and everything so

197.47 --> 203.87
it was Owen Benjamin and then later in

201.139 --> 207.049
the night very late and I managed to

203.87 --> 211.31
stay up to see it all that was Karen B

207.049 --> 215.0
and Brian doing their typical what is it

211.31 --> 219.949
they're they called again the B stream

215.0 --> 223.579
and yeah they got Owen Benjamin on that

219.949 --> 225.979
was pretty pretty interesting also again

223.579 --> 230.0
just going very deeply into the whole

225.979 --> 232.579
Mandela thing and like every time I

230.0 --> 234.43
listen to it again it just it kind of

232.579 --> 240.59
makes me nervous

234.43 --> 245.54000000000002
find it all very confusing but I do have

240.59 --> 248.84
ideas about it but I I don't know

245.54 --> 250.939
it's not ready to even openly talk about

248.84 --> 254.419
it she'll maybe talk about it behind the

250.939 --> 257.59
scenes with with them with Ryan maybe

254.419 --> 257.59000000000003
that would be interesting

258.45 --> 268.27
Yeah right oh yeah also 24/7 discord

266.26 --> 271.57
went on there I even went on there this

268.27 --> 273.94
morning at 12 o'clock so you might have

271.57 --> 276.09
caught me there because I get on there

273.94 --> 278.38
like all the time really these days

276.09 --> 280.51
because you can always pop in there and

278.38 --> 284.139
I don't know they all know me kind of

280.51 --> 286.12
now and it kind of works it's almost

284.139 --> 289.09000000000003
like a flat earth debate panel except

286.12 --> 297.97
it's less themed and can literally just

289.09 --> 301.0
move in and out did you see Adam greenie

297.97 --> 306.82000000000005
debating X enforce employee on D life no

301.0 --> 310.15
I didn't what's what happened I know I

306.82 --> 315.84999999999997
had no idea I don't know everything that

310.15 --> 318.69
goes around on D life but it yeah that's

315.85 --> 318.69
it sounds interesting

322.99 --> 332.96000000000004
[Music]

324.61 --> 337.25
yeah there's a there was this item also

332.96 --> 340.5
concerning Mike Adams who's just been

337.25 --> 342.22
like doubling down on everything

340.5 --> 346.28
[Music]

342.22 --> 350.11
doubling down on on the globe doubling

346.28 --> 354.22999999999996
down on the coronavirus doubling down

350.11 --> 356.93
and that yeah it's really annoying so I

354.23 --> 358.76
get it that a lot of people feel the

356.93 --> 368.72
need to basically point that out in

358.76 --> 373.88
videos I'm very annoyed by to Adam Green

368.72 --> 376.67
what is Adam Green set from no more news

373.88 --> 382.1
that guy is it somebody else

376.67 --> 385.76
oh god right well yeah I don't really

382.1 --> 387.86
watch that anymore but because that guy

385.76 --> 389.57
is just really obsessed with the

387.86 --> 394.0
singular thing as you know what I mean

389.57 --> 397.36
if you know what I mean hey Marco bucks

394.0 --> 397.36
truth matters

402.07 --> 406.65999999999997
but yeah there I guess there is a lot of

405.58 --> 408.7
hassle

406.66 --> 412.23
concerning the Infowars and all that and

408.7 --> 412.22999999999996
so much to say about it

422.85 --> 430.05
huh okay Marceline okay uh yeah all

427.74 --> 432.12
depends really I just you know I've just

430.05 --> 436.35
been digging around a little here and

432.12 --> 439.08
there and well a guy that I've used to

436.35 --> 441.48
follow a lot live to fail but he's just

439.08 --> 444.39
completely obsessed with the coronavirus

441.48 --> 446.28000000000003
like seriously like every single

444.39 --> 449.52
freaking day he's been doing just

446.28 --> 452.58
exclusive coronavirus related hangouts

449.52 --> 459.18
it's getting kind of old given like

452.58 --> 462.63
really you know see Jaron ISM is also

459.18 --> 468.44
double streams over adi life so you

462.63 --> 468.44
could watch him there a couple of bears

469.76 --> 475.28999999999996
yeah a guy I don't know he's just not

473.67 --> 479.25
necessarily like a flat earth or

475.29 --> 484.29
anything or but yeah the ugly jew is a

479.25 --> 487.2
guy who regularly he just plays funny

484.29 --> 489.36
video most of the time and i don't know

487.2 --> 492.93
also gives attention to mainstream

489.36 --> 494.91
issues like presidential debates or

492.93 --> 499.01
whatever is some type you know is all

494.91 --> 502.5
over the place so that can be fun and

499.01 --> 504.81
somebody I met there his rogue ways but

502.5 --> 508.11
she also has a much bigger YouTube

504.81 --> 514.37
channel so I don't know most I don't

508.11 --> 519.65
know a lot of exclusive D life streamers

514.37 --> 519.65
most of them also stream on YouTube

526.269 --> 533.089
yeah other than that I don't I don't

528.829 --> 535.55
even have more people I'm subscribed to

533.089 --> 542.089
I might come across it I know there are

535.55 --> 543.529
a lot more out there but oh by the way

542.089 --> 549.2900000000001
thank you good service for the dollar

543.529 --> 554.62
super chat donation almost forgot it's

549.29 --> 554.62
jet stuck again no that's not

568.07 --> 577.97
right so anyway yeah I had this

573.61 --> 582.29
conversation with another guy who

577.97 --> 587.87
studied at the University who was really

582.29 --> 590.779
gathering information I think he was

587.87 --> 592.699
like a psychology student even and he

590.779 --> 596.99
was gathering information concerning

592.699 --> 599.66
Flat Earth views and globe Earth views

596.99 --> 602.029
putting together a piece about it it's

599.66 --> 605.269
very interesting but I think that it's

602.029 --> 607.49
gonna be non opinionated about the

605.269 --> 611.54
actual cosmology and purely focused on

607.49 --> 613.88
the on the mind sets developments and

611.54 --> 615.709
responses so I think he's like building

613.88 --> 619.779
a psychological project to kind of

615.709 --> 622.1899999999999
figure out yeah what is going on here

619.779 --> 627.5
with the Flat Earth Rose's globe Earth

622.19 --> 629.87
debate in general and I I had a long

627.5 --> 633.529
long conversation he pulled all kinds of

629.87 --> 635.199
information out of me so that happened

633.529 --> 638.54
what is his name again

635.199 --> 640.75
anyway that was on discord in a private

638.54 --> 640.75
conversation

645.25 --> 651.01
see what else

672.35 --> 678.21
right other than that it's it's mostly

675.93 --> 681.81
just more a baller spiraling out of

678.21 --> 684.1500000000001
control and misbehavior and making more

681.81 --> 686.4
ridiculous statements it happens like on

684.15 --> 688.17
a daily basis now if people like Riley

686.4 --> 690.03
try to keep track of it but it's like a

688.17 --> 691.56
full-time job just trying to keep track

690.03 --> 694.3199999999999
of all the silly things that they say

691.56 --> 705.2399999999999
these days your response to the Black

694.32 --> 705.6
Swan and all that what kind of question

705.24 --> 708.62
is that

705.6 --> 708.62
Ares 106

744.17 --> 748.2199999999999
in the new cute what the new queue

747.35 --> 750.8000000000001
against the system

748.22 --> 754.21
Austin Stein Bart never heard of him

750.8 --> 754.2099999999999
Joan M who's that

768.0 --> 773.519
oh so do you think that April 1st is

770.85 --> 776.49
gonna every yeah that a wave is gonna

773.519 --> 777.93
hit the world a shock way for everybody

776.49 --> 780.029
will get sick you think that's gonna

777.93 --> 791.279
happen right then I have no idea man

780.029 --> 794.43
no idea you know when you think about it

791.279 --> 795.3
carefully it could just be a very

794.43 --> 799.2299999999999
complex

795.3 --> 806.6289999999999
complex April Fool's joke just think

799.23 --> 806.629
about it but yeah

806.64 --> 815.5889999999999
[Music]

823.04 --> 826.42
ah yeah

828.75 --> 836.1
too bad by the way yeah again Tom Parker

832.8 --> 840.569
student I you still at home I tried to

836.1 --> 843.87
say hello but I haven't caught him since

840.569 --> 851.3389999999999
I last talked to him which was yesterday

843.87 --> 853.699
I think or no no I think it was even two

851.339 --> 853.6990000000001
days ago

858.709 --> 873.0
no Marceline electromagnetism cannot

862.379 --> 875.9590000000001
replace gravity or relative density need

873.0 --> 875.959
us to do 68

892.99 --> 899.41
yeah dad it's Earth token yeah I bet you

896.74 --> 901.5
think that now they should they don't

899.41 --> 905.88
though

901.5 --> 905.88
isn't that just telling that they don't

909.3 --> 915.0999999999999
well Tom Parker look it's just that I

912.82 --> 917.1400000000001
thought I kind of agreed with him that

915.1 --> 919.15
he would come on my show he said he had

917.14 --> 920.86
no problem with being on that early yeah

919.15 --> 922.4499999999999
but if he's just never around when I

920.86 --> 926.26
started my show then there's nothing

922.45 --> 928.48
really gonna happen so you could remind

926.26 --> 931.18
him about it maybe got preoccupied with

928.48 --> 932.98
other things but it's basically up to

931.18 --> 935.5
him I'm not gonna demand any kind of

932.98 --> 938.58
specific moment that he said has to be

935.5 --> 938.58
there it's up to him

949.85 --> 956.78
it's Jeffrey bill I see what you did

954.72 --> 956.78
there

961.31 --> 964.3699999999999
[Music]

968.23 --> 971.23
right

976.45 --> 979.499
[Music]

985.4 --> 992.93
while Marco Beck's you know the go fast

990.24 --> 996.12
rocket won the app seated many times but

992.93 --> 999.38
does it really hit something it seems

996.12 --> 1007.58
like the spinning stops for some reason

999.38 --> 1009.53
but there's the sound some kind I just

1007.58 --> 1014.33
don't know what exactly is going on with

1009.53 --> 1017.8399999999999
that you know just think about it if it

1014.33 --> 1021.9200000000001
would be hitting something physical that

1017.84 --> 1022.73
would be inflexible I think there would

1021.92 --> 1024.98
yeah

1022.73 --> 1027.41
that camera would not be whole I think

1024.98 --> 1029.48
that like the whole top of the rocket

1027.41 --> 1032.78
would basically burst under the sudden

1029.48 --> 1035.209
impact what do you think so think about

1032.78 --> 1040.19
it carefully what is really happening

1035.209 --> 1043.43
there yeah just these little details

1040.19 --> 1045.3500000000001
like that people people have just this

1043.43 --> 1049.43
physicality assumption bias based

1045.35 --> 1051.34
thinking to get things fitting so they

1049.43 --> 1057.74
overlook these little little things

1051.34 --> 1060.3799999999999
little consistencies you know it's very

1057.74 --> 1063.41
typical so if it would be hitting a

1060.38 --> 1068.24
solid object that is inflexible at that

1063.41 --> 1076.64
speed it would say splat yet it doesn't

1068.24 --> 1080.18
really it just goes Shh so what what is

1076.64 --> 1081.41
that what's happening I don't know man I

1080.18 --> 1084.77
don't know

1081.41 --> 1087.41
oh that footage is fake oh is it Walter

1084.77 --> 1090.44
really so tell me how did they fake that

1087.41 --> 1093.5
how did they CGI that what did they cut

1090.44 --> 1096.8
out where's the cut where's the

1093.5 --> 1097.25
Photoshop editing overlay I don't think

1096.8 --> 1098.8999999999999
so

1097.25 --> 1101.12
I think that is real I think it's just

1098.9 --> 1104.3500000000001
completely misunderstood what is

1101.12 --> 1104.35
actually happening there

1117.27 --> 1120.3899999999999
[Music]

1124.33 --> 1127.05
right

1128.18 --> 1134.0600000000002
now look on the other hand no I add a

1131.06 --> 1137.24
maken by the way if you start to think

1134.06 --> 1140.72
of that suppose it Barry that could be

1137.24 --> 1144.59
as something not so rigid something more

1140.72 --> 1149.3600000000001
flexible something more like a a field

1144.59 --> 1152.1799999999998
that could just boy you flex back as it

1149.36 --> 1154.6699999999998
were well maybe then it will make a

1152.18 --> 1158.18
little bit more sense yeah doesn't

1154.67 --> 1162.88
exactly really help a lot

1158.18 --> 1166.28
concerning explaining the realm because

1162.88 --> 1168.38
flex your flexible barrier like what how

1166.28 --> 1171.68
can that work how can a realm have a

1168.38 --> 1175.3700000000001
flexible barrier what does that mean

1171.68 --> 1177.05
what is that and then people are gonna

1175.37 --> 1181.6999999999998
be inspired of course think of all

1177.05 --> 1186.05
undoes the water above and it's like an

1181.7 --> 1188.75
ocean or yeah yeah I don't know but it

1186.05 --> 1191.12
seems like it's definitely not a rigid

1188.75 --> 1198.08
solid barrier because then the rocket

1191.12 --> 1203.4499999999998
would say splat at that speed ah oh by

1198.08 --> 1206.84
the way I got a I got a reply on skype

1203.45 --> 1209.21
from your student Tom Parker and he says

1206.84 --> 1211.6299999999999
he was indeed busy without work and all

1209.21 --> 1211.63
that so

1226.98 --> 1233.34
then what are meteors I don't know man

1230.14 --> 1233.3400000000001
I don't know

1240.77 --> 1247.679
well flat assassins look.this meteors is

1245.309 --> 1249.809
a concept right it's a heliocentric

1247.679 --> 1252.63
conception that's how we learn about it

1249.809 --> 1255.48
a rock flying through space that's what

1252.63 --> 1258.7700000000002
we think is a meteor so now we're gonna

1255.48 --> 1261.72
compare that to actual sightings and

1258.77 --> 1267.45
then suddenly you get split up

1261.72 --> 1271.8600000000001
categories you get the the little light

1267.45 --> 1275.6100000000001
lines and apparently this happens a lot

1271.86 --> 1277.9799999999998
during August or that's how I remember

1275.61 --> 1280.74
it like a lot of those happen during

1277.98 --> 1283.049
August for some reason especially the

1280.74 --> 1285.6
skies clear then you see it a lot you

1283.049 --> 1287.97
know summer vacation we always do that

1285.6 --> 1290.1599999999999
like oh yeah August it's a good time to

1287.97 --> 1292.1100000000001
go out in the night and just enjoy the

1290.16 --> 1295.47
sky and see a lot of falling stars and

1292.11 --> 1298.1999999999998
all that right so that thing I don't

1295.47 --> 1301.669
know if that is a literal physical

1298.2 --> 1307.02
object or if it is indeed some kind of

1301.669 --> 1309.96
other level of celestial body like quick

1307.02 --> 1312.87
appearing and disappearing stars just as

1309.96 --> 1316.3500000000001
their the the planets are wandering

1312.87 --> 1318.51
stars slowly moving that these flashes

1316.35 --> 1322.1689999999999
are maybe just suddenly appearing and

1318.51 --> 1324.179
disappearing falling stars like that

1322.169 --> 1325.71
that they are part of the celestial

1324.179 --> 1328.799
globe of the heavens and not physically

1325.71 --> 1334.679
real in any way now on the other hand

1328.799 --> 1337.1689999999999
I've personally witnessed like meteor

1334.679 --> 1340.65
like effects that I could definitely

1337.169 --> 1342.929
determine had proximities that were

1340.65 --> 1346.52
actually physical and that would give

1342.929 --> 1349.74
off sound of personally witnessed that

1346.52 --> 1352.35
so I know is that the same thing I don't

1349.74 --> 1355.98
know where is that coming from I know

1352.35 --> 1357.87
even less it's very confusing to me you

1355.98 --> 1360.75
know I've even theorized that maybe some

1357.87 --> 1362.8799999999999
of this is artificially created by some

1360.75 --> 1364.679
yeah we're no secret societies or

1362.88 --> 1367.8300000000002
whatever that just launched these things

1364.679 --> 1370.88
with catapults for some reason that I

1367.83 --> 1373.58
did it completely eludes me

1370.88 --> 1378.15
although I could think of something that

1373.58 --> 1380.01
that and yeah these two types of falling

1378.15 --> 1384.24
star phenomena are just very different

1380.01 --> 1387.65
one has like burning up metal glitter

1384.24 --> 1390.09
including the flesh typical flesh and

1387.65 --> 1392.93
sound and the crackling sound that can

1390.09 --> 1396.24
come of it if it's very close to you or

1392.93 --> 1400.14
close enough to you and the other is

1396.24 --> 1405.09
just this like flesh little stripe light

1400.14 --> 1409.5600000000002
above and they seem to be two completely

1405.09 --> 1411.27
different things even though in the

1409.56 --> 1414.6799999999998
general conception of it they're all

1411.27 --> 1414.68
classified as meteors

1421.43 --> 1425.3590000000002
[Music]

1445.06 --> 1448.119
[Music]

1451.09 --> 1456.1299999999999
truth matters sure sonic boom I don't

1454.18 --> 1460.27
know I don't know if it's actually going

1456.13 --> 1462.94
that fast it's not like the glittery

1460.27 --> 1466.48
meteor is literally like a giant flaming

1462.94 --> 1469.9
stripe that I then see and can determine

1466.48 --> 1473.44
has a proximity to me know it really

1469.9 --> 1476.23
does seem just like a glittering rock

1473.44 --> 1483.04
falling burning up that's the things

1476.23 --> 1484.9
that I've seen it's very odd but I

1483.04 --> 1487.47
wouldn't say that any sound from that

1484.9 --> 1489.49
came from sound barrier breaking

1487.47 --> 1491.47
although on the other hand yeah it's

1489.49 --> 1495.21
also seemed like for example those

1491.47 --> 1498.97
extreme meteor explosions above Russia

1495.21 --> 1506.5
they do seem to go incredibly fast now

1498.97 --> 1508.59
what is that I don't know man I don't

1506.5 --> 1508.59
know

1515.29 --> 1519.8799999999999
oh you're Sarita cause you probably seen

1517.93 --> 1523.27
that footage is it's gone around on

1519.88 --> 1525.16
YouTube for a long time just like people

1523.27 --> 1529.24
driving around in Russia they all have

1525.16 --> 1530.88
their desktop their desk cam because I

1529.24 --> 1534.22
think it's part of insurance their

1530.88 --> 1536.5
standard and then it's like there's

1534.22 --> 1540.58
something really bright really bright

1536.5 --> 1544.24
and then just flash giant flash and you

1540.58 --> 1550.3
see like a big smoke trail and it's very

1544.24 --> 1554.77
weird that seem to seem to be very

1550.3 --> 1558.78
physical so I have no idea no idea how

1554.77 --> 1561.01
that is how that comes into being

1558.78 --> 1563.8
they're not an actual impact though

1561.01 --> 1568.39
that's that's always it isn't it how

1563.8 --> 1571.8999999999999
many actual impacts I've never seen

1568.39 --> 1575.8000000000002
those you know never heard on the news

1571.9 --> 1579.52
like oh look a meteor has impacted look

1575.8 --> 1582.28
the crater has you have you ever ever

1579.52 --> 1585.51
ever ever seen that no it's always like

1582.28 --> 1588.85
oh look it exploded just before below

1585.51 --> 1593.47
above the surface or whatever and but

1588.85 --> 1595.99
that's it right

1593.47 --> 1598.48
even Tunguska was not an impact

1595.99 --> 1600.67
something exploded or something right up

1598.48 --> 1604.72
off the surface could flattening all

1600.67 --> 1612.04
those trees but again no direct physical

1604.72 --> 1613.27
impact so what is that you know if I

1612.04 --> 1615.43
could take an entirely different

1613.27 --> 1617.49
approach which is kind of odd then I

1615.43 --> 1620.5
don't know don't take it too serious but

1617.49 --> 1629.02
maybe in some way it could be like this

1620.5 --> 1631.39
I know maybe a specific type of ball

1629.02 --> 1634.18
lightning type effect you know ball eye

1631.39 --> 1638.98
things are freaking weird as well well

1634.18 --> 1641.02
maybe it is like a contact spark in a

1638.98 --> 1645.1
specific way and that it has so much

1641.02 --> 1647.77
energy that it just maybe creates plasma

1645.1 --> 1648.73
on the spot that just looks like a

1647.77 --> 1651.91
burning

1648.73 --> 1654.07
thing that that moves I don't know man

1651.91 --> 1658.6000000000001
this is just a wild speculation at this

1654.07 --> 1663.21
point but it could be all kinds of

1658.6 --> 1663.2099999999998
things that we are now misinterpreting

1676.559 --> 1679.7
Ami's gang

1686.99 --> 1693.98
that another world what do you mean from

1691.76 --> 1697.09
another realm that is being catapulted

1693.98 --> 1705.5
from another realm section who knows

1697.09 --> 1709.1599999999999
maybe I don't know you know considering

1705.5 --> 1713.09
the level of control that seems to exist

1709.16 --> 1715.97
and is it within the grasp of humans you

1713.09 --> 1718.52
could even argue that the whole meteor

1715.97 --> 1720.8600000000001
thing is just part of the program

1718.52 --> 1722.98
literally that it's all just timed

1720.86 --> 1727.55
catapulting that it's all part of a very

1722.98 --> 1732.35
very very long-standing program that is

1727.55 --> 1734.09
completely surreal to us and they just

1732.35 --> 1739.8999999999999
do it I don't know man

1734.09 --> 1739.8999999999999
I really don't know it could be

1753.179 --> 1762.029
Oh Kendall [ __ ] get out of here

1756.859 --> 1767.07
constellation there is no physical realm

1762.029 --> 1772.529
other than Earth okay there may be other

1767.07 --> 1774.389
realms sections but you can't yeah I'm

1772.529 --> 1774.809
sure you're not here to mess with my

1774.389 --> 1780.1789999999999
mind

1774.809 --> 1783.33
candor [ __ ] yeah I'm sure you are so

1780.179 --> 1787.3790000000001
reliable no of course you're not trying

1783.33 --> 1790.589
to do that you just really really

1787.379 --> 1792.779
believe the planet [ __ ] and

1790.589 --> 1794.639
rearrange everything around it so it

1792.779 --> 1799.95
seems so I'm sure you're not trying to

1794.639 --> 1801.559
mess with me okay but yeah there's no

1799.95 --> 1807.32
other physical realms

1801.559 --> 1807.32
Kendall [ __ ] there's one earth realm

1817.809 --> 1825.639
yeah stars are light forth matters it's

1820.779 --> 1828.7
like just like light only there's

1825.639 --> 1831.58
nothing from which light comes that is

1828.7 --> 1834.1490000000001
part of it no it's just like light

1831.58 --> 1834.149
manifests

1838.69 --> 1841.759
[Music]

1847.179 --> 1852.5900000000001
nope

1848.84 --> 1856.1
dome is old the wrestle there is a

1852.59 --> 1857.84
limited amount of space the realm has a

1856.1 --> 1860.799
limited amount of space there is no

1857.84 --> 1865.61
infinity in physical reality whatsoever

1860.799 --> 1869.24
but that is as far as I'll go because a

1865.61 --> 1874.4289999999999
dome that's already kind of

1869.24 --> 1877.809
presuppositional there's so many only so

1874.429 --> 1883.5700000000002
many types of shapes the dome can take

1877.809 --> 1883.57
and I don't think it's correct

1897.179 --> 1907.3600000000001
what am i basing these claims on well on

1900.58 --> 1911.47
reality physical reality in nature the

1907.36 --> 1913.6899999999998
natural law all these things cannot be

1911.47 --> 1918.279
infinite space it's physical

1913.69 --> 1920.799
impossibility but any anything you do

1918.279 --> 1923.279
concerning physical things if you draw

1920.799 --> 1928.87
it into infinity it doesn't work anymore

1923.279 --> 1933.36
maricon physicality cannot and cannot

1928.87 --> 1933.36
coexist with infinity doesn't work

1940.64 --> 1950.8400000000001
[Music]

1947.21 --> 1953.33
you can of course always try to prove me

1950.84 --> 1955.039
different yeah but that's the thing

1953.33 --> 1961.3899999999999
about natural loss doesn't really work

1955.039 --> 1964.37
out now does it turn your website

1961.39 --> 1967.51
literally five minutes ago explain the

1964.37 --> 1967.51
whole deal please

2002.72 --> 2007.72
no Dear John em that doesn't sound very

2005.42 --> 2007.72
good

2018.789 --> 2026.649
oh yes sure of course truth matters we

2023.709 --> 2030.309
have maps because of the Stars

2026.649 --> 2034.32
so yeah the projections are and the

2030.309 --> 2039.209
orientations are all based on on the

2034.32 --> 2043.109
consistency of the patterns of the stars

2039.209 --> 2043.1090000000002
in relation to the earth

2063.81 --> 2067.82
hi everybody welcome to we change week

2073.97 --> 2076.5989999999997
Wow

2079.129 --> 2084.609
I think that Kendall [ __ ] is just

2083.089 --> 2087.23
trolling me here

2084.609 --> 2089.75
she has an actual Channel seems to be

2087.23 --> 2095.0
gamer oriented I think she's probably

2089.75 --> 2097.509
here because she feels like I don't know

2095.0 --> 2100.46
defending her

2097.509 --> 2105.7400000000002
cosmology she's used to in all the games

2100.46 --> 2107.839
I don't know yeah you're definitely not

2105.74 --> 2112.549
gonna fool anyone that you are anything

2107.839 --> 2116.14
but just a random woman that does games

2112.549 --> 2116.14
on YouTube sorry

2148.44 --> 2151.069
yeah

2151.4 --> 2157.579
yeah of course it can come across as

2153.98 --> 2161.779
absurd because it is but I bet that to

2157.579 --> 2166.3390000000004
you this seems like a very promising and

2161.779 --> 2170.72
viable idea like you're more than just

2166.339 --> 2173.9
that human having a YouTube channel in

2170.72 --> 2175.73
this kind of wretched world and it's

2173.9 --> 2178.88
very interesting to imagine that you

2175.73 --> 2183.049
might be somehow some kind of spirit

2178.88 --> 2185.809
from somewhere else and ya have these

2183.049 --> 2188.96
amazing secrets to share that you feel

2185.809 --> 2193.2690000000002
yeah you know why because I had kind of

2188.96 --> 2197.9
similar issues myself 20 years ago yeah

2193.269 --> 2199.8489999999997
so what cognition break does to you once

2197.9 --> 2201.4700000000003
you really awake to reality and figure

2199.849 --> 2204.7400000000002
out that you can actually handle it then

2201.47 --> 2207.2
your mind your ego starts to basically

2204.74 --> 2211.1899999999996
create fantasy constructs for you to

2207.2 --> 2213.74
find temporary more meaning outside of

2211.19 --> 2220.19
the ashes that you feel you've arrived

2213.74 --> 2224.799
at so yeah exactly share the pain now of

2220.19 --> 2229.239
course you don't but it's definitely

2224.799 --> 2234.079
escapist intentions it's definitely that

2229.239 --> 2238.009
it's that to you and you wanna dross and

2234.079 --> 2240.319
that's not gonna work because the entire

2238.009 --> 2242.93
basis of everything you're saying just

2240.319 --> 2245.0299999999997
does not work with everything we've

2242.93 --> 2248.359
learned here

2245.03 --> 2248.3590000000004
[Music]

2254.23 --> 2266.77
okay truth matter sure he did yeah yeah

2262.58 --> 2268.67
sure if conspiracy cats things that

2266.77 --> 2273.16
presupposing the shape of the earth

2268.67 --> 2276.35
wrapped underneath a blanket of stars

2273.16 --> 2278.5099999999998
then that to him sure would proof the

2276.35 --> 2280.3399999999997
shape of the earth now wouldn't it and

2278.51 --> 2282.59
unfortunately in reality doesn't really

2280.34 --> 2285.6800000000003
unless you presuppose it but he knows

2282.59 --> 2288.4900000000002
that you just don't don't like to remind

2285.68 --> 2288.49
people about it

2328.43 --> 2335.3489999999997
oh really so what is your job there what

2332.569 --> 2339.64
is your job can now fog besides

2335.349 --> 2339.6400000000003
reviewing games on YouTube

2362.49 --> 2370.0
all right okay well Kendall [ __ ] you

2365.86 --> 2372.04
have two minutes to start coming clean

2370.0 --> 2374.08
and just say what you do if you're just

2372.04 --> 2376.69
gonna keep us hanging on with this

2374.08 --> 2379.72
[ __ ] I'm going to ban you because

2376.69 --> 2383.52
you're being an annoying distraction at

2379.72 --> 2385.54
this moment okay

2383.52 --> 2388.74
professional artists many different

2385.54 --> 2415.14
things all right yeah okay that's great

2388.74 --> 2415.14
goody yeah

2417.39 --> 2422.749
yeah yeah see see the down vote yeah

2420.39 --> 2426.21
they didn't like that it's called

2422.749 --> 2427.859
identifying a narrative agent good

2426.21 --> 2432.21
artists it's just the artists just

2427.859 --> 2437.519
listen to the stories get it away get it

2432.21 --> 2439.92
away don't talk about down-to-earth

2437.519 --> 2444.269
things and figuring out what is real

2439.92 --> 2447.839
what isn't and advice on how not to jump

2444.269 --> 2450.5389999999998
to conclusions with things and then

2447.839 --> 2452.94
nobody out there that has control that

2450.539 --> 2456.829
his money likes that they really don't

2452.94 --> 2459.96
so yeah these artists that could just

2456.829 --> 2462.42
fantasize about nonsense and distract

2459.96 --> 2467.18
everyone it's favored it's their

2462.42 --> 2467.1800000000003
favorite did it promote it

2487.89 --> 2492.8289999999997
yeah that's right truth matters and he

2490.41 --> 2492.8289999999997
doesn't

2534.819 --> 2539.459
what are you saying Shawn Thor Neal

2549.48 --> 2555.9900000000002
yeah they didn't like that oh I ruined

2553.53 --> 2558.69
their little plan i lured their little

2555.99 --> 2565.339
plan here comes the trolls here comes

2558.69 --> 2568.2000000000003
the trolls here comes the trolls yeah

2565.339 --> 2572.79
they don't like it when i nip their

2568.2 --> 2575.1499999999996
stupid little plan in the bud i don't

2572.79 --> 2575.15
like it

2585.3 --> 2588.389
[Music]

2612.71 --> 2619.099
Wow well John em that's a fascinating

2615.589 --> 2621.74
theory I don't know man

2619.099 --> 2625.07
I don't know if spaceforce is anything

2621.74 --> 2629.1189999999997
other than simply another layer of mind

2625.07 --> 2633.71
control to steer things maybe it is like

2629.119 --> 2636.32
a media apparatus to steer the political

2633.71 --> 2638.39
narrative more directly just as the news

2636.32 --> 2638.9
narrative is there to steer our daily

2638.39 --> 2641.27
lives

2638.9 --> 2644.3
maybe that is what it's all about but

2641.27 --> 2647.359
maybe you're right maybe it does have to

2644.3 --> 2651.8300000000004
do with some extra realm in other

2647.359 --> 2655.79
segments of the realm civilization

2651.83 --> 2657.859
that we are coming in contact with like

2655.79 --> 2660.5
what what for whatever reason the

2657.859 --> 2664.31
barriers have opened or they have like

2660.5 --> 2667.599
it has been allowed by the ultimate

2664.31 --> 2671.2999999999997
overseer or whatever an agenda a thing

2667.599 --> 2675.02
somewhere that contact is initiated

2671.3 --> 2679.5800000000004
so maybe the space force is like that is

2675.02 --> 2682.0099999999998
kind of a covert conquering thing I

2679.58 --> 2685.39
don't know man I really really don't

2682.01 --> 2685.3900000000003
know for sure it could all be

2700.07 --> 2705.71
oh you want to know you want to know how

2703.55 --> 2711.1600000000003
I timed you out let me look back I'll

2705.71 --> 2711.16
just tell everyone is this

2713.829 --> 2719.5190000000002
it's been a while ago oh yeah

2732.28 --> 2739.6000000000004
well it might have I might have just it

2735.55 --> 2744.34
might have been a bad timing not too

2739.6 --> 2749.68
sure man yeah but I can't even find the

2744.34 --> 2754.54
proper message back in all with the yeah

2749.68 --> 2767.9199999999996
the bandwidth can Kendall folks deleted

2754.54 --> 2770.999
messages in between yeah

2767.92 --> 2770.9990000000003
[Music]

2771.14 --> 2774.64
all right it's okay

2777.33 --> 2784.21
right

2778.87 --> 2786.58
it's a little tough because sometimes

2784.21 --> 2789.64
forget there is a little delay also as

2786.58 --> 2792.25
to what you see or what you hear from me

2789.64 --> 2794.17
and what happens in the chat and all of

2792.25 --> 2798.25
you yeah you do definitely get

2794.17 --> 2800.05
preoccupied with one another temporarily

2798.25 --> 2802.39
not really keeping track of what's going

2800.05 --> 2806.77
on and then yeah sometimes the words

2802.39 --> 2808.92
just completely hit the wrong tone as it

2806.77 --> 2808.92
were

2828.8 --> 2831.5800000000004
hmm

2845.61 --> 2850.4700000000003
right it's okay unicorns say it's you

2848.32 --> 2850.4700000000003
know

2859.57 --> 2864.76
yeah and yesterday was just the you know

2862.27 --> 2869.59
yesterday I was blatantly obvious I saw

2864.76 --> 2875.5
it back I actually watched it back then

2869.59 --> 2881.92
I was yeah really pissed off it's kind

2875.5 --> 2885.43
of odd because I remember even some

2881.92 --> 2886.4500000000003
other teachers at similar type of

2885.43 --> 2888.7599999999998
responses

2886.45 --> 2891.37
I've known teachers that had these type

2888.76 --> 2893.44
of heavy pains as well

2891.37 --> 2895.56
they actually shared that with me I had

2893.44 --> 2898.39
a great deal of respect for that teacher

2895.56 --> 2901.36
but sometimes when he had like these

2898.39 --> 2903.7599999999998
pain episodes the next day in school he

2901.36 --> 2905.71
would be pretty pissed off like

2903.76 --> 2907.9300000000003
long-toed as well but everybody would

2905.71 --> 2909.46
respect that if he didn't you had a big

2907.93 --> 2914.0499999999997
problem because then he would send you

2909.46 --> 2915.19
like running ten laps around the school

2914.05 --> 2917.29
and all that [ __ ]

2915.19 --> 2919.03
well everybody was looking out the

2917.29 --> 2921.88
window and laughing at you like from

2919.03 --> 2925.57
every class so yeah when he was pissed

2921.88 --> 2934.21
off you didn't wanted what he won but I

2925.57 --> 2937.03
don't know it's just you know people can

2934.21 --> 2939.48
only take so much pain before that just

2937.03 --> 2939.48
happens

2939.75 --> 2944.599
yeah

2941.54 --> 2944.599
[Music]

2952.59 --> 2964.01
to only do prepaid online transactions

2956.79 --> 2964.0099999999998
okay that's all fine

2966.84 --> 2974.4300000000003
and contribute if you can you know i'm

2972.03 --> 2977.5800000000004
yeah and talking about contributions i'm

2974.43 --> 2981.98
still i still really haven't gotten to

2977.58 --> 2985.47
need to be or win a thumb the concerning

2981.98 --> 2987.72
the fresh air system it's just that I

2985.47 --> 2992.64
kind of get preoccupied with things like

2987.72 --> 2995.22
flatter this car 24/7 and all that to

2992.64 --> 2998.19
really organize a stream myself in the

2995.22 --> 3003.97
evening I don't know it's I get too

2998.19 --> 3003.9700000000003
distracted but I should really do that

3004.42 --> 3017.65
maybe I'll do it tomorrow Saturday

3007.55 --> 3017.65
somewhere hmm oh really Sean Thornhill

3020.57 --> 3023.2000000000003
yeah

3039.28 --> 3042.5400000000004
or is that a question

3074.92 --> 3079.4500000000003
no truth matters I don't think we can

3077.44 --> 3083.23
use the geometry of the Stars to solve

3079.45 --> 3087.43
flatter globe because in geometry would

3083.23 --> 3093.67
already be presuppositional and assuming

3087.43 --> 3095.77
they are physical so no the other thing

3093.67 --> 3100.41
you can do with the Stars and their

3095.77 --> 3106.17
orientation their angular orientation is

3100.41 --> 3106.17
yes set distance is based on celestial

3106.29 --> 3116.31
rotation contacts as it were that's how

3112.72 --> 3120.1
the the maps are basically projected

3116.31 --> 3125.23
based on that but you can determine

3120.1 --> 3128.97
anything about the geometry of the earth

3125.23 --> 3128.97
itself just from the Stars

3161.369 --> 3171.989
well yeah mark color you're right but it

3169.739 --> 3174.479
would only be radically different if you

3171.989 --> 3176.279
still presume that those celestial

3174.479 --> 3178.339
bodies ought to be in specific locations

3176.279 --> 3180.809
in the first instance

3178.339 --> 3184.049
comparing the sightings the angular

3180.809 --> 3187.049
sightings based on the orientation of

3184.049 --> 3189.839
the earth plane and now if you would

3187.049 --> 3195.329
presuppose that the orientation of the

3189.839 --> 3199.38
earth plane would be disc oriented then

3195.329 --> 3202.13
suddenly the preset positions of stars

3199.38 --> 3206.46
and Sun and Moon being in the specific

3202.13 --> 3209.309
location becomes viable once again with

3206.46 --> 3212.039
closer distances the thing is though is

3209.309 --> 3213.96
a pretty damn sure that the celestial

3212.039 --> 3216.9300000000003
bodies are not literally in those

3213.96 --> 3219.69
locations I think that is quite

3216.93 --> 3224.489
disprovable so there you go that's a

3219.69 --> 3226.2000000000003
problem and it's also what makes the

3224.489 --> 3231.299
disc so appealing is basically a

3226.2 --> 3234.569
replacement presupposition framework for

3231.299 --> 3237.059
the bulk cosmology into a disc cosmology

3234.569 --> 3239.999
but still yeah it's so misleading

3237.059 --> 3242.0690000000004
because it suggests that these celestial

3239.999 --> 3247.2
bodies are literally in these positions

3242.069 --> 3250.469
on the disc and they're not they are not

3247.2 --> 3254.45
anywhere they are lights and they have

3250.469 --> 3256.89
angular relations to the observer in

3254.45 --> 3259.7
relation to the position on the earth

3256.89 --> 3259.7
and that's it

3263.38 --> 3266.9590000000003
[Music]

3281.11 --> 3286.88
yeah that's none of your damn business

3283.4 --> 3291.83
Darwin why are you here you shouldn't be

3286.88 --> 3296.62
here I'll talk about it when I'll talk

3291.83 --> 3296.62
about it which maybe never ever

3342.84 --> 3350.5
okay stars are angels based on what

3346.93 --> 3353.3199999999997
what's an angel if you'd go with a

3350.5 --> 3357.42
certain type of energy influence sure

3353.32 --> 3361.3590000000004
that's like the astrological approach

3357.42 --> 3363.76
sure stars probably are an energy

3361.359 --> 3366.46
influence in some way as in the spirits

3363.76 --> 3370.42
influence which gets is so extremely

3366.46 --> 3374.17
esoteric that I don't think anybody can

3370.42 --> 3377.83
seriously get it a model of it that

3374.17 --> 3381.369
makes any sense but yeah and by that

3377.83 --> 3385.54
standard ooh stars or angels but yeah

3381.369 --> 3387.79
literal personified consciousness that

3385.54 --> 3390.54
serve a greater consciousness though

3387.79 --> 3393.96
yeah really

3390.54 --> 3393.96
based on what

3404.099 --> 3409.949
yeah the pollster gives us the latitude

3407.039 --> 3415.17
of the viewer couldn't we use that

3409.949 --> 3418.759
geometry what geometry geometry would

3415.17 --> 3422.13
require presuppositions there is no

3418.759 --> 3424.279
geometry to be derived from any of the

3422.13 --> 3427.559
celestial bodies and their orientation

3424.279 --> 3430.369
truth matters none whatsoever

3427.559 --> 3433.949
because all of that would require you to

3430.369 --> 3436.739
assume they are physical objects in

3433.949 --> 3440.219
literal positions and that the earth

3436.739 --> 3442.38
would have will have to be based on how

3440.219 --> 3445.38
you see them how you perceive them and

3442.38 --> 3448.109
always based on specific presuppositions

3445.38 --> 3452.339
for the earth shape so the only way you

3448.109 --> 3456.479
could ever use stars or any celestial

3452.339 --> 3459.569
bodies to prove the shape of Earth is by

3456.479 --> 3462.9199999999996
presupposing that shape of Earth it's

3459.569 --> 3466.739
the only way there is no other way to

3462.92 --> 3468.9790000000003
have it involved so you can forget about

3466.739 --> 3468.979
it

3470.989 --> 3476.279
that's really nice navigation yeah

3473.789 --> 3479.369
that's really nice oh yeah we know I've

3476.279 --> 3481.41
even shared that the celestial body

3479.369 --> 3483.449
orientation in relation to the position

3481.41 --> 3487.14
of the earth is kind of specific so you

3483.449 --> 3490.859
sure could use it for navigation

3487.14 --> 3495.229
absolutely it doesn't prove a shape of

3490.859 --> 3495.229
the earth unless you presuppose it

3499.15 --> 3506.2400000000002
all right so I'm gonna round out the

3502.49 --> 3508.9399999999996
show thanks everyone for coming I hope

3506.24 --> 3510.47
you liked the show if you did then

3508.94 --> 3512.0
please don't forget the ribbons up and

3510.47 --> 3513.56
if you haven't already subscribed to my

3512.0 --> 3515.24
channel and hit the bell notification so

3513.56 --> 3517.2799999999997
you know when I'm going live which is

3515.24 --> 3517.7599999999998
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

3517.28 --> 3520.1000000000004
day

3517.76 --> 3521.8100000000004
please also do support me through the

3520.1 --> 3522.89
paypal patreon my GoFundMe in a super

3521.81 --> 3527.48
check there will be much appreciated

3522.89 --> 3529.96
please do drop some especially on my

3527.48 --> 3532.55
GoFundMe although I do get a lot of

3529.96 --> 3535.52
PayPal's as well while not a lot well

3532.55 --> 3537.98
actually kind of a lot for my doing so

3535.52 --> 3541.4
it's kind of building up I could safely

3537.98 --> 3544.64
say I'm kind of halfway but not there

3541.4 --> 3548.98
yet so please keep them coming so I can

3544.64 --> 3552.8599999999997
get that new fresh air system and yeah

3548.98 --> 3554.48
that will be much appreciated so I will

3552.86 --> 3558.23
be back tomorrow with flat earth early

3554.48 --> 3560.89
bird number 477 then I'm going to join

3558.23 --> 3564.17
the Flat Earth debates right after this

3560.89 --> 3569.35
hashtag meifa indeed over Mukul and

3564.17 --> 3569.35
until the next video keep it flat
