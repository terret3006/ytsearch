114.56 --> 121.84
skies very little win this

118.84 --> 121.84
time

123.439 --> 129.799
lots of sun I'm really liking it I

126.159 --> 129.799
actually got up a bit earlier

130.76 --> 136.35999999999999
today that's why I'm so on time and yeah

134.92 --> 138.95899999999997
I

136.36 --> 143.92000000000002
thought Sun this out and bright I'm

138.959 --> 143.92000000000002
going to scoop that up as much as I

144.8 --> 151.76000000000002
can with my skin scooping up Sun

157.56 --> 162.879
right

159.319 --> 165.51899999999998
anyhow it is Wednesday the 10th of

162.879 --> 165.51899999999998
January

168.04 --> 173.4
2024 temperature is still freezing I

170.879 --> 173.39999999999998
sure of

173.68 --> 178.4
it minus 2° C

178.76 --> 181.76
yep

181.879 --> 187.39999999999998
H it's going to get clouded again

184.4 --> 187.4
tomorrow

189.0 --> 196.159
says

190.68 --> 198.84
geus 7 at night it was like really

196.159 --> 202.959
really cold this

198.84 --> 204.76
night so minus 7 makes sense to me God I

202.959 --> 210.64000000000001
can't believe I actually

204.76 --> 213.28
slept like with the door open and that

210.64 --> 213.27999999999997
pretty

213.84 --> 219.04
heavy the cold but I survived

224.2 --> 231.319
it right so

227.72 --> 236.0
yesterday my show was was

231.319 --> 238.07899999999998
okay that was decent enough BL Earth

236.0 --> 241.68
debates was also

238.079 --> 241.68
interesting what's

241.92 --> 245.67999999999998
again talking about

247.72 --> 250.72
again

268.6 --> 271.6
forgot

272.039 --> 275.32
we on about again

287.16 --> 293.199
yesterday right whatever QE live was

290.6 --> 296.12
also there and like even before he went

293.199 --> 298.56
live he he kind of showed that video

296.12 --> 301.479
that we was going to be

298.56 --> 303.52
reviewing

301.479 --> 304.919
and it was like interesting and

303.52 --> 308.71999999999997
hilarious

304.919 --> 312.039
too so yeah later that even sort of a qy

308.72 --> 312.03900000000004
life treatment

313.12 --> 319.759
hybrid all right also found a really

316.88 --> 324.56
unexpected very cool game sort of a net

319.759 --> 324.56
hack Style game that that

325.199 --> 331.479
type so that's always nice to find a

328.36 --> 331.47900000000004
game like that

334.479 --> 338.479
on new grounds now

336.479 --> 341.0
this sometimes they have like

338.479 --> 344.68
surprisingly good things but you have to

341.0 --> 346.919
like really dig or not really dig rather

344.68 --> 349.039
wait until somebody actually has a good

346.919 --> 352.19899999999996
game in

349.039 --> 355.199
there CU there's a lot of stuff being

352.199 --> 355.199
made

358.479 --> 363.31899999999996
and it's not all that like a it's all

361.8 --> 365.8
like kind of short

363.319 --> 368.639
fun

365.8 --> 372.12
but yeah

368.639 --> 376.72
that that later own

372.12 --> 376.72
Benjamin continuing that whole

376.759 --> 381.88
thing I was just watching like Dr Shiva

380.759 --> 386.44
still out

381.88 --> 389.08
there and he's getting like the

386.44 --> 391.479
[ __ ] like that guy he was on like

389.08 --> 395.12
obvious ly watches Owen Benjamin and he

391.479 --> 397.24
was like he was really trying to push

395.12 --> 400.639
like you could see that that whole [ __ ]

397.24 --> 402.68
fast was kind of like influencing him

400.639 --> 408.319
but I

402.68 --> 409.919
mean Dr Shiva like got through it very

408.319 --> 413.28000000000003
very

409.919 --> 415.96
smart with with good points and rebuttal

413.28 --> 418.4
so but it's been an interesting show to

415.96 --> 421.4
watch I'm like

418.4 --> 421.4
halfway

443.91 --> 447.079
[Music]

448.319 --> 451.319
uh

455.16 --> 460.12
France is getting this

457.28 --> 465.479
new WF

460.12 --> 465.479
agent in their cabinet again

465.639 --> 468.639
sucks

469.039 --> 475.039
uh

471.199 --> 478.319
yeah guess that's kind of

475.039 --> 480.12
it now let's see who else is going to be

478.319 --> 483.47900000000004
early

480.12 --> 486.72
it's a downside of not being on time a

483.479 --> 488.87899999999996
lot is that people like don't come to

486.72 --> 492.199
expect you to be on time and that's

488.879 --> 492.199
purely my own fault

493.599 --> 498.479
so yeah don't have any Illuminati C on

503.08 --> 509.28
today and probably not for a while since

506.039 --> 512.479
I'm just going to be scrambling to get

509.28 --> 516.24
ERS and all that and then things like

512.479 --> 516.24
Illuminati become kind of

522.68 --> 528.2399999999999
unaffordable right but at the same time

525.48 --> 531.32
I still feel pretty

528.24 --> 534.44
good like I should feel like kind of

531.32 --> 535.5600000000001
[ __ ] actually considering like the bills

534.44 --> 538.5600000000001
that I'm

535.56 --> 540.8
getting like this debt that is it's

538.56 --> 545.1199999999999
literally like like

540.8 --> 545.12
growing and I I didn't even do

546.04 --> 551.56
anything it

548.399 --> 555.959
sucks and I'm probably going to contact

551.56 --> 560.5999999999999
like social worker about it somewhere

555.959 --> 565.04
this week maybe after the show I'm not

560.6 --> 565.0400000000001
sure I try to contact them at

568.12 --> 572.72
least

569.88 --> 574.92
because like yeah this is is worrisome

572.72 --> 577.9590000000001
especially like that I I can't do

574.92 --> 580.4799999999999
anything about it I really

577.959 --> 583.64
can't I can't pay bills when I'm

580.48 --> 586.9590000000001
literally scrambling for

583.64 --> 586.959
food and it

591.839 --> 598.72
sucks all right hey and if there was

594.8 --> 601.24
some Fantastical job solution that would

598.72 --> 602.839
just immediately fix it and then no more

601.24 --> 605.72
problem yeah

602.839 --> 607.44
dude let me know about that job I'll

605.72 --> 610.44
take

607.44 --> 614.0400000000001
it or I'll try to take it and then not

610.44 --> 614.0400000000001
get it because I don't really have a

614.56 --> 621.56
resume so maybe all of you guys and

617.399 --> 625.12
trolls could just complain more about

621.56 --> 625.1199999999999
that see if that

627.6 --> 631.0400000000001
helps right

654.519 --> 659.9590000000001
or just nobody show up that's fine I

657.48 --> 662.399
mean I'm the one to

659.959 --> 665.5189999999999
blame like everybody should be like a

662.399 --> 668.32
half an hour late so because that's

665.519 --> 671.639
usually what I

668.32 --> 674.72
am but to be fair I want to change that

671.639 --> 677.24
as well although it's got to be worth it

674.72 --> 681.6
though because if I'm going to like be

677.24 --> 683.6800000000001
on time a lot and then everybody else

681.6 --> 687.0
that tends to show up is going to be

683.68 --> 689.959
late every time then I'm literally going

687.0 --> 694.72
to cut the first hour off the show

689.959 --> 694.7199999999999
permanently I'm just like not doing that

697.76 --> 700.76
anymore

717.959 --> 720.959
right

730.46 --> 733.639
[Music]

742.04 --> 744.36
all

747.88 --> 750.88
right

782.72 --> 787.36
all right so yeah I guess it's just

784.56 --> 787.3599999999999
going to be this

795.639 --> 804.36
then oh Nathan just uploaded a

800.12 --> 804.36
short Dell upward moving Earth

805.04 --> 810.76
short yep

807.76 --> 810.76
yep

818.959 --> 826.0
hey I'm curious hello flat land first in

823.639 --> 829.5600000000001
chat hey

826.0 --> 833.24

829.56 --> 836.0
so why in everybody on fed treats Q like

833.24 --> 842.36
some sort of Guru I

836.0 --> 842.36
don't so that's just immediate straw

842.92 --> 845.8389999999999
man don't know what the hell you're

844.959 --> 849.5189999999999
talking

845.839 --> 852.12
about maybe you're just

849.519 --> 856.72
projecting maybe you're secretly

852.12 --> 856.72
treating him like a flat Earth Guru

857.839 --> 861.0400000000001
God I'm

867.68 --> 870.68
not

890.279 --> 894.04

897.68 --> 903.16
thing

899.959 --> 903.16
I'm GNA just leave it out

914.32 --> 923.36
there what the

917.639 --> 923.36
hell is this the type of ads they give

926.839 --> 930.36
Jesus that is

929.16 --> 934.36
that

930.36 --> 937.88
wow that's advertisement for Amazon

934.36 --> 942.36
Prime they they think that that is going

937.88 --> 945.399
to convince me to join

942.36 --> 947.9590000000001
that these people are straight out of

945.399 --> 947.959
their [ __ ]

948.199 --> 952.88
minds they must have like brain

953.519 --> 960.6
parasites the people that make these

957.6 --> 960.6
ads

964.079 --> 966.68
absolutely

979.519 --> 984.759
insane I see you L advertisement on yeah

982.839 --> 987.36
well apparently they think my show is

984.759 --> 990.519
good enough for advertisement

987.36 --> 993.6
now like half a year ago they just shut

990.519 --> 996.24
it all off for a whole long time like

993.6 --> 999.0790000000001
nobody was interested or something but

996.24 --> 999.0790000000001
now they're all

1000.639 --> 1006.279
good but I mean some of these ads are

1003.56 --> 1010.7199999999999
that I get to see are just like what the

1006.279 --> 1016.48
[ __ ] is this crap doing here do they pay

1010.72 --> 1016.48
you uh indirectly I mean on the long run

1016.68 --> 1023.6899999999999
sure I do get some stuff in from Google

1021.079 --> 1025.1599999999999

yeah I was just watching

1047.4 --> 1050.4
that

1056.76 --> 1060.96
yeah glad to have you here I thought it

1058.559 --> 1065.6
was going to be like really

1060.96 --> 1065.6000000000001
empty since I was so on

1065.72 --> 1071.76
time but I I try to be I'm going to try

1068.559 --> 1074.0
to definitely be more on time well at

1071.76 --> 1077.4
least when it this kind of

1074.0 --> 1080.4
weather cuz I want that extra

1077.4 --> 1080.4
sunlight

1090.679 --> 1097.76
yes tered I know he's a complete

1094.32 --> 1100.6399999999999
copycat pack the

1097.76 --> 1104.28
snake I watched Reacher

1100.64 --> 1104.2800000000002
series movies

1107.32 --> 1110.32
yeah

1118.96 --> 1123.88
I watched that a while

1120.6 --> 1123.8799999999999
ago last

1125.08 --> 1130.559
year I think or the year before even I

1127.88 --> 1130.5590000000002
don't remember

1137.32 --> 1140.32
exactly

1147.36 --> 1151.52
yeah well ter yeah I hope so I hope

1150.2 --> 1155.28
you're

1151.52 --> 1158.0
right I hope people are seeing

1155.28 --> 1160.84
it you wouldn't really be able to tell

1158.0 --> 1160.84
by media

1162.12 --> 1165.12
though

1167.24 --> 1170.24
barely

1227.159 --> 1230.159
for

1237.799 --> 1242.0
what do I think about the approved

1240.159 --> 1245.7600000000002
Amendment

1242.0 --> 1250.039
Auditors I think they're right with the

1245.76 --> 1250.039
police I I don't

1255.28 --> 1261.08
know they I'd say they would have have

1258.32 --> 1261.08
to know what they're

1271.799 --> 1278.52
doing that guy sneako attention Spanish

1275.0 --> 1278.52
you think

1282.559 --> 1290.039
bro yeah no [ __ ] a

1287.039 --> 1290.039
lot

1290.799 --> 1297.039
I should watch them it's interesting no

1294.36 --> 1297.039
no not

1297.679 --> 1303.919
really I I don't think I should watch

1300.4 --> 1303.919
them I think I'd get really

1309.44 --> 1317.039
bored like I have no Ambitions to like

1314.2 --> 1321.0
learn to do that

1317.039 --> 1323.1589999999999
even of no in like I'm not a guy like oh

1321.0 --> 1326.36
I want to get in everybody's face during

1323.159 --> 1328.919
a protest or something

1326.36 --> 1330.799
uh you know on the other hand maybe I

1328.919 --> 1332.76
should and I'm just kind of worried that

1330.799 --> 1336.0
if I do

1332.76 --> 1338.6
that like I don't know that I'd like

1336.0 --> 1341.72
[ __ ] it up that maybe go rage win or

1338.6 --> 1344.84
something like I I kind of like don't

1341.72 --> 1344.84
really want to do all

1344.96 --> 1350.799
that cuz being in a group the group

1348.84 --> 1353.8799999999999
dynamics tends to

1350.799 --> 1356.75
like make it more difficult for me to

1353.88 --> 1359.8090000000002
like keep a grip on

1356.75 --> 1359.809
[Music]

1361.279 --> 1369.2
myself like I've always had that

1365.12 --> 1369.1999999999998
problem and it is a

1376.72 --> 1381.88
problem so so like learning what they do

1380.2 --> 1384.159
is never going to like what the hell is

1381.88 --> 1389.159
that going to be of

1384.159 --> 1389.159
use the police dogs in the Netherlands

1389.88 --> 1398.0
no no they are

1392.919 --> 1398.0
not that police have a very tough time

1400.24 --> 1407.44
here like they are like saturated with

1403.679 --> 1408.76
stupid detail rules like so many that

1407.44 --> 1410.44
like

1408.76 --> 1414.0
pretty much guarantees that I'm never

1410.44 --> 1419.6000000000001
going to be police like there's no

1414.0 --> 1422.64
way that I'm going to like stick to all

1419.6 --> 1425.279
that I wouldn't even be able to memorize

1422.64 --> 1428.4
the freaking rules so

1425.279 --> 1431.6
many and like and they get all rolled

1428.4 --> 1434.24
into freaking sjw [ __ ] I mean it's all

1431.6 --> 1438.12
getting [ __ ] up

1434.24 --> 1440.76
man it's [ __ ] up the rules stay have

1438.12 --> 1440.76
to endure

1453.6 --> 1459.1589999999999
here yeah and I know in America they

1456.279 --> 1460.24
have issues there with the police that's

1459.159 --> 1463.3200000000002
a whole

1460.24 --> 1467.2
different scenario

1463.32 --> 1469.72
though we then don't have whole like

1467.2 --> 1471.919
groups of people regly like start

1469.72 --> 1473.3600000000001
rioting and just kill a bunch of random

1471.919 --> 1476.24
people

1473.36 --> 1478.7199999999998
yeah that doesn't really happen here I

1476.24 --> 1481.3990000000001
mean it happens on a smaller scale

1478.72 --> 1484.3600000000001
sometimes but when it does it's a big

1481.399 --> 1487.799
hassle yeah in America that [ __ ] happens

1484.36 --> 1487.799
like every freaking day it's

1489.6 --> 1495.52
insane aren't the rules design to

1492.2 --> 1499.76
protect the public from the police

1495.52 --> 1499.76
abuse yeah but it's not working

1506.6 --> 1510.039
though like at

1510.08 --> 1515.4399999999998
all I mean the police abuse where it

1512.72 --> 1517.3600000000001
happens it's still happens and all those

1515.44 --> 1519.72
stupid little rules have like nothing to

1517.36 --> 1519.7199999999998
do with

1523.039 --> 1529.679
that stupid little rules just make it

1525.799 --> 1529.679
much more difficult to be in effect

1538.44 --> 1543.48
C

1540.6 --> 1546.039
right and not saying like oh no rules

1543.48 --> 1548.52
for the police now of course some rule

1546.039 --> 1549.559
that's of course should be some but I

1548.52 --> 1552.84
mean

1549.559 --> 1555.76
it's they just snow you under here I

1552.84 --> 1559.08
mean it's it's a it's a Dutch thing I

1555.76 --> 1561.36
think they're all just like like so easy

1559.08 --> 1564.6789999999999
to just let a bunch of

1561.36 --> 1567.7199999999998
nitpicking dicks just keep making rules

1564.679 --> 1570.679
for everything and like [ __ ] off bro

1567.72 --> 1574.0
like we don't I don't want to [ __ ]

1570.679 --> 1576.3200000000002
cage on how to do everything in detail I

1574.0 --> 1578.919
don't want to be your stupid

1576.32 --> 1581.24
robot with your [ __ ] little rules

1578.919 --> 1581.24
[ __ ]

1586.6 --> 1591.6399999999999
off

1588.96 --> 1591.64
yeah

1594.32 --> 1602.8799999999999
so right I mean police abuse here like

1599.76 --> 1603.919
from Individual cops I mean that's just

1602.88 --> 1606.3600000000001
super

1603.919 --> 1608.5590000000002
rare right in the United States that

1606.36 --> 1611.6399999999999
might happen I don't think it's really

1608.559 --> 1614.76
on average a problem at

1611.64 --> 1618.1200000000001
all I think it's much worse a problem

1614.76 --> 1620.559
like the actual public on average and

1618.12 --> 1624.6789999999999
what they're doing

1620.559 --> 1628.12
like now that's something that everybody

1624.679 --> 1629.96
needs protection from and who does that

1628.12 --> 1632.52
police if you're going to give the

1629.96 --> 1636.159
police more rules it's going to be

1632.52 --> 1639.039
harder for them to actually do their

1636.159 --> 1642.0390000000002
job in times when they are so

1639.039 --> 1642.039
needed

1646.52 --> 1651.279
yeah

1649.0 --> 1652.84
are police allowed to stop walking in

1651.279 --> 1655.0
the street and amend their personal

1652.84 --> 1658.559
information

1655.0 --> 1658.559
no clearly

1672.6 --> 1677.84
not right there's a very specific

1675.88 --> 1680.0390000000002
condition for that you have to they have

1677.84 --> 1681.9599999999998
to have something on you they have to

1680.039 --> 1684.679
see you make a

1681.96 --> 1687.48
violation of some sort they have to have

1684.679 --> 1690.88
a reasonable suspicion all that yeah

1687.48 --> 1692.84
those are rules that do make sense yeah

1690.88 --> 1695.3600000000001
that's not the nitpicky rules I'm

1692.84 --> 1695.36
complaining

1701.159 --> 1710.0390000000002
about and that's just common

1705.12 --> 1714.279
sense tactics as a police

1710.039 --> 1716.84
officer and like they have to they can't

1714.279 --> 1719.88
just like otherwise they might get power

1716.84 --> 1722.8799999999999
drunk and and then just start picking on

1719.88 --> 1722.88
people

1723.96 --> 1727.8400000000001
right that's right hey Nathan

1733.76 --> 1739.399
Ole yeah

1736.399 --> 1739.399
exactly

1741.76 --> 1748.36
right but the point is is that police

1745.559 --> 1750.6789999999999
the pro those rules technically don't

1748.36 --> 1753.12
even prevent police from going after

1750.679 --> 1756.039
somebody because they could just have a

1753.12 --> 1758.1999999999998
guy [ __ ] around with him put something

1756.039 --> 1762.44
on them and like oh Reasonable Suspicion

1758.2 --> 1762.44
right they do that [ __ ] all the time

1763.72 --> 1769.519
anyway

1766.32 --> 1772.8799999999999
but even as a surface rule it would

1769.519 --> 1775.0
still help protect people that they

1772.88 --> 1779.279
don't have to fear just out of nowhere

1775.0 --> 1779.279
getting picked on by

1783.6 --> 1792.0
police so yeah but I mean here

1787.919 --> 1792.0
it yeah it works like that as

1793.96 --> 1798.919
well but there's there's different weird

1797.399 --> 1801.36
things here though because there's like

1798.919 --> 1805.44
a lot of policy [ __ ] that is also

1801.36 --> 1805.4399999999998
involved with police which is a terrible

1811.679 --> 1817.72
idea but I mean like it's it's not going

1815.399 --> 1820.4799999999998
to be of much use as

1817.72 --> 1821.96
long it's like this man like you can

1820.48 --> 1824.559
have like all the

1821.96 --> 1826.24
best police officers in the world a

1824.559 --> 1828.559
bunch of

1826.24 --> 1831.76
Legends

1828.559 --> 1834.519
that just never stop doing what they do

1831.76 --> 1838.8799999999999
that's cute if your judges are all a

1834.519 --> 1841.44
bunch of their deranged corrupted

1838.88 --> 1843.279
freaks that have their own agenda that

1841.44 --> 1845.6000000000001
is like anti- the

1843.279 --> 1848.24
country whether they realize it or not

1845.6 --> 1851.279
some insane ideology that they want to

1848.24 --> 1854.519
impose upon the world yeah then all the

1851.279 --> 1856.2
cops in the world aren't going to fix it

1854.519 --> 1858.0
cuz the judge are just going to [ __ ] it

1856.2 --> 1862.559
up and throw the ter terrible people

1858.0 --> 1865.0
back on the street and and bu political

1862.559 --> 1868.24
threats down to all hell they're going

1865.0 --> 1870.72
to do all of that anyway can have all

1868.24 --> 1874.039
the best cops in the world the judges

1870.72 --> 1874.039
are rotten you're

1881.48 --> 1885.96
[ __ ] right and that's a universal

1884.159 --> 1889.2
problem right now in the

1885.96 --> 1893.08
west if has been revealed in the last

1889.2 --> 1896.0800000000002
few decades that a lot of higher aelon

1893.08 --> 1900.1589999999999
people like judges and governments all

1896.08 --> 1903.1999999999998
that that like a massive amount of them

1900.159 --> 1905.3600000000001
massive unprecedented

1903.2 --> 1906.6390000000001
percentages of people in there have

1905.36 --> 1910.799
become

1906.639 --> 1910.799
completely insanely

1911.24 --> 1915.84
corrupted that's it's never happened

1913.76 --> 1919.279
like that before to this

1915.84 --> 1923.72
scale and we're all [ __ ] everybody in

1919.279 --> 1925.559
the west is [ __ ] because of that and I

1923.72 --> 1928.48
said it earlier like the only real

1925.559 --> 1931.08
Solution that's not going to happen is

1928.48 --> 1934.2
if we all just point it out and just

1931.08 --> 1936.48
like lock them up just immediately like

1934.2 --> 1939.6000000000001
at that point even like [ __ ] the law

1936.48 --> 1941.1200000000001
[ __ ] everything these people are sitting

1939.6 --> 1943.48
in the seat of power they're going to

1941.12 --> 1945.279
destroy everything including the law

1943.48 --> 1948.3600000000001
they already doing it they're going to

1945.279 --> 1951.84
destroy everything your mind your

1948.36 --> 1955.799
finances your culture

1951.84 --> 1957.84
everything until we literally prevent

1955.799 --> 1961.32
them from doing that

1957.84 --> 1963.519
permanently in a big swoop it's not

1961.32 --> 1966.2
going to happen been crying out for it

1963.519 --> 1968.0
for years it's not going to happen

1966.2 --> 1970.3990000000001
everybody's going to be content at just

1968.0 --> 1972.519
bickering complaining feeling all self

1970.399 --> 1975.279
righteous as they're all getting

1972.519 --> 1977.1200000000001
stripped from everything they got and

1975.279 --> 1979.679
that's including me I'm going to just

1977.12 --> 1981.399
just be sitting there and enduring it

1979.679 --> 1985.3600000000001
like everybody

1981.399 --> 1988.2399999999998
else except I'm not going to think like

1985.36 --> 1990.9189999999999
oh I deserve it no no I know we're all

1988.24 --> 1992.76
[ __ ] I tried to speak out about it the

1990.919 --> 1995.679
only Redemption would have been is that

1992.76 --> 1997.639
if I actually G to physically assaulted

1995.679 --> 1998.8400000000001
it and definitely ended up in jail the

1997.639 --> 2001.8799999999999
rest of my

1998.84 --> 2005.9599999999998
life yeah but I didn't I choose I chose

2001.88 --> 2010.1200000000001
not to do that so now I'm completely

2005.96 --> 2014.24
[ __ ] like everybody

2010.12 --> 2016.7199999999998
else but at least I said it I said what

2014.24 --> 2018.0
should have happened and that isn't

2016.72 --> 2019.519
going to

2018.0 --> 2024.44
happen

2019.519 --> 2028.48
so what else can I do except and my

2024.44 --> 2028.48
life trying to fix the

2030.639 --> 2034.8799999999999
world hey Rach G see

2035.96 --> 2038.96
you

2050.8 --> 2054.9190000000003
what what are you talking about

2065.879 --> 2068.879
naan

2074.639 --> 2081.359
getting close what are you talking

2078.28 --> 2083.32
about you're talking about coming the

2081.359 --> 2085.5989999999997
monsters we fight

2083.32 --> 2088.8
against

2085.599 --> 2088.8
uh I

2091.159 --> 2098.0
guess I miss mostly addressing like my

2095.72 --> 2100.48
main grievances and that is there's

2098.0 --> 2103.839
really [ __ ] corrupt people in

2100.48 --> 2107.079
there it's becoming widely known and

2103.839 --> 2110.52
still nothing happens they're still

2107.079 --> 2112.4
there like everybody's expecting it to

2110.52 --> 2114.839
just now that it's discovered to

2112.4 --> 2116.92
naturally go away well it isn't

2114.839 --> 2119.44
naturally going

2116.92 --> 2122.32
away and

2119.44 --> 2124.599
threats aren't making it go away either

2122.32 --> 2126.1600000000003
not even legal threats like oh I got you

2124.599 --> 2129.079
we're going to do this process and

2126.16 --> 2132.2
they're all just like yeah do it then

2129.079 --> 2134.8390000000004
that [ __ ] takes like 40 Years anyway

2132.2 --> 2137.52
we're going to [ __ ] your country up you

2134.839 --> 2141.48
take the legal long route while we [ __ ]

2137.52 --> 2145.52
your country up by the time you're

2141.48 --> 2147.48
done like you won't even have heating

2145.52 --> 2151.16
anywhere ever

2147.48 --> 2152.64
again but you'll get us oh yeah like

2151.16 --> 2156.2
they don't

2152.64 --> 2158.7999999999997
care they're playing on this they're

2156.2 --> 2160.9199999999996
playing on um how slow things are and

2158.8 --> 2162.92
they're like they think they got it and

2160.92 --> 2165.44
in a way they

2162.92 --> 2169.28
did they got

2165.44 --> 2172.319
us we have to step out of this format in

2169.28 --> 2175.92
order to stop them and they're counting

2172.319 --> 2179.72
on that nobody will because everybody

2175.92 --> 2181.6800000000003
will just think that then they'll die

2179.72 --> 2184.839
then their life is

2181.68 --> 2187.68
over cuz even if individuals do such

2184.839 --> 2189.52
things it doesn't result in suddenly

2187.68 --> 2191.16
everybody's standing up and doing it

2189.52 --> 2193.8
like in the

2191.16 --> 2195.7599999999998
movies if only if only that really

2193.8 --> 2198.4
happened no everybody out there is going

2195.76 --> 2202.4
to be really content for anybody else to

2198.4 --> 2205.92
try anything get killed for it and then

2202.4 --> 2209.599
be absolutely gratified how they didn't

2205.92 --> 2211.96
die and nothing got better that's this

2209.599 --> 2211.96
[ __ ]

2215.68 --> 2218.68
world

2232.839 --> 2239.16
great BL what no I've not read it what

2236.52 --> 2239.16
are you talking

2244.56 --> 2251.48
about been telling this what have you

2247.56 --> 2251.48
been telling for ages

2271.119 --> 2276.839
now right but I mean I don't even want

2274.48 --> 2281.359
to freaking worry like I'm just caught

2276.839 --> 2281.359
in this freaking Paradigm of my

2281.44 --> 2288.56
own like I want to get out of this

2285.079 --> 2288.5600000000004
terrible situation

2288.76 --> 2297.44
financially but the world is [ __ ] out

2293.119 --> 2299.76
there it really is in ways many ways it

2297.44 --> 2299.76
is

2299.88 --> 2307.88
[ __ ] so then I have to like I will

2305.24 --> 2310.9199999999996
just like start to think about how how

2307.88 --> 2315.319
to fix the system in order for me to get

2310.92 --> 2317.6800000000003
that opportunity to unfuck my own life

2315.319 --> 2320.92
basically and then you're just stuck

2317.68 --> 2320.9199999999996
you're just stuck like

2322.0 --> 2328.319
yeah either you'll go out with a bunch

2324.56 --> 2331.2
of pitchforks and knives and whatnot and

2328.319 --> 2334.88
just [ __ ] them up like absolutely [ __ ]

2331.2 --> 2336.64
them up and they're all dead and then

2334.88 --> 2339.6400000000003
police or whatever and then yeah you're

2336.64 --> 2341.319
life is over and so your life is just

2339.64 --> 2342.839
over like how do you want your life to

2341.319 --> 2346.079
be over you want

2342.839 --> 2347.4
it to do some real damage with the real

2346.079 --> 2352.079
[ __ ] evil

2347.4 --> 2354.2000000000003
people or you want it slowly

2352.079 --> 2356.119
disintegrating while those evil people

2354.2 --> 2358.3999999999996
just keep doing everything they do

2356.119 --> 2359.7200000000003
unabated and they don't care about how

2358.4 --> 2362.64
much they're

2359.72 --> 2365.1189999999997
exposed because they don't you might

2362.64 --> 2369.2
have take notice of that yeah they don't

2365.119 --> 2369.2000000000003
care they're being exposed

2377.0 --> 2380.76
anymore yeah that's a sign of

2378.92 --> 2383.04
normalization that's a sign that they

2380.76 --> 2385.7200000000003
think they can get away with it it's a

2383.04 --> 2388.16
sign that they no longer feel the threat

2385.72 --> 2390.24
that by being open about it that risks

2388.16 --> 2393.8799999999997
them from getting

2390.24 --> 2397.2
assassinated by random people not

2393.88 --> 2401.079
agencies yeah that's what that means

2397.2 --> 2403.839
it means they no longer feel a threat a

2401.079 --> 2408.0
physical threat from the common public

2403.839 --> 2408.0
in other words they

2408.04 --> 2412.68
won

2409.56 --> 2416.599
yeah they're doing it in the open

2412.68 --> 2416.5989999999997
because they

2425.359 --> 2428.359
won

2432.72 --> 2437.56
and everybody just is going to take it

2436.04 --> 2439.72
they're going to take it they're going

2437.56 --> 2441.68
to make Illusions about themselves how

2439.72 --> 2443.72
they're going to get out of it they're

2441.68 --> 2446.9199999999996
going to make illusions of how it's

2443.72 --> 2449.2
going to end at some point and it won't

2446.92 --> 2453.28
none of it will it will only get worse

2449.2 --> 2453.2799999999997
and nobody will do anything about

2454.72 --> 2461.72
it except for maybe people like Dr Shiva

2458.96 --> 2464.119
and he people that are capable of like

2461.72 --> 2467.319
maintaining their life they can

2464.119 --> 2469.1600000000003
just prevent a little entropy yeah but

2467.319 --> 2472.0
it's not going to fix the situation nor

2469.16 --> 2474.56
is the world going to be fixed so just

2472.0 --> 2476.76
holding on a little longer than the rest

2474.56 --> 2478.56
that's just slipping and extinguishing

2476.76 --> 2481.1600000000003
very quickly because they don't have a

2478.56 --> 2484.68
grip on this hellish situation that we

2481.16 --> 2484.68
found ourselves in

2485.24 --> 2488.24
collectively

2492.04 --> 2498.96
yeah sure Jason I'm sure I will [ __ ]

2495.44 --> 2504.079
that there's just that's just a

2498.96 --> 2507.2400000000002
no it's just a no Jason that's not how

2504.079 --> 2507.2400000000002
that [ __ ] works at

2510.64 --> 2516.68
all you don't even know what's happening

2513.92 --> 2519.76
there what it actually is that they do

2516.68 --> 2522.48
and why that's even happening like it

2519.76 --> 2524.7200000000003
is yeah you think it's just some random

2522.48 --> 2527.599
Booth you can walk up to and just get a

2524.72 --> 2531.16
career like that doing this crazy

2527.599 --> 2533.319
illegal scam setup thing no now people

2531.16 --> 2537.16
actually get

2533.319 --> 2539.64
sacrificed yeah people die in the

2537.16 --> 2541.92
process and like get their so organs get

2539.64 --> 2544.44
sold and all that [ __ ] that that's in

2541.92 --> 2547.2400000000002
between all that crap that they do yeah

2544.44 --> 2551.0
that's part of it that's what's

2547.24 --> 2555.0789999999997
financing all that crap is human

2551.0 --> 2557.8
sacrifice basically yeah so yeah I can't

2555.079 --> 2560.0
just oh well my life is [ __ ] here just

2557.8 --> 2562.04
start over again in the United States

2560.0 --> 2565.16
yeah

2562.04 --> 2568.48
right yeah in your [ __ ] dreams baby

2565.16 --> 2568.48
it doesn't work like that at

2575.16 --> 2578.16
all

2605.079 --> 2608.079
e

2614.559 --> 2622.0400000000004
the ration the end of the world China oh

2618.559 --> 2626.44
yeah sure I'm sure it was spelled out in

2622.04 --> 2630.0
there China I'm sure

2626.44 --> 2632.88
flatland right I'm sure you know exactly

2630.0 --> 2632.88
how that's going to

2634.48 --> 2638.92
happen sure you think that you

2651.48 --> 2654.48
do

2660.52 --> 2666.64
right I don't know man I am super

2664.16 --> 2668.8799999999997
blackpilled about it

2666.64 --> 2672.4
with that

2668.88 --> 2675.2000000000003
[ __ ] like I'm just wondering like if we

2672.4 --> 2678.6800000000003
the people can [ __ ] finish off these

2675.2 --> 2681.5989999999997
demonic scumbags that have taken us over

2678.68 --> 2683.7999999999997
then who will maybe the Chinese will do

2681.599 --> 2686.92
it you know I mean yeah we'll lose all

2683.8 --> 2689.6400000000003
our freedoms we'll become feudal slaves

2686.92 --> 2692.44
effectively but at least those

2689.64 --> 2694.839
disgusting cretons have a greater

2692.44 --> 2696.8
likelihood of completely losing control

2694.839 --> 2698.7999999999997
and or dying

2696.8 --> 2701.6800000000003
which they definitely

2698.8 --> 2704.76
deserve right so there's

2701.68 --> 2707.359
that like unless somebody here actually

2704.76 --> 2711.559
wants to do something about it and then

2707.359 --> 2711.5589999999997
maybe maybe not feudal

2713.599 --> 2720.28
slavery I don't know one can

2717.22 --> 2720.2799999999997
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2729.2000000000003
dream

2726.68 --> 2732.2
right or maybe they'll just like spray

2729.2 --> 2734.4399999999996
us all with sing gas or something at

2732.2 --> 2737.8799999999997
some point and just like oh just

2734.44 --> 2741.92
everybody dies we'll just kill

2737.88 --> 2744.04
everything all in one big swoop right

2741.92 --> 2746.0
and then later say oh it was nuked it

2744.04 --> 2748.44
was really nuked yeah it's just

2746.0 --> 2751.52
everybody dead so who can tell what

2748.44 --> 2755.16
really happened there or not you know

2751.52 --> 2757.72
can just like rearrange it and use build

2755.16 --> 2759.64
bulldozer to create an artificial crater

2757.72 --> 2762.8799999999997
if they wanted

2759.64 --> 2766.44
to right if everybody's

2762.88 --> 2770.6400000000003
dead nobody to tell left to tell the

2766.44 --> 2775.04
story okay enough of this [ __ ] right I I

2770.64 --> 2775.04
want to be a little bit more positive

2775.8 --> 2780.88
so let's just start with my direct

2778.76 --> 2782.48
surroundings and some things that I can

2780.88 --> 2785.4
do something

2782.48 --> 2788.319
about like not dwelling on [ __ ]

2785.4 --> 2788.319
Darkness so

2789.559 --> 2796.119
much right one thing you could

2792.839 --> 2799.599
definitely make the darkness

2796.119 --> 2803.4
decrease in my mindset

2799.599 --> 2806.3590000000004
is donating some money to my

2803.4 --> 2809.52
PayPal so that I don't have to worry

2806.359 --> 2811.64
whether I'm going to be eating tomorrow

2809.52 --> 2811.64
at

2812.119 --> 2819.8
all H that definitely helps

2817.76 --> 2822.6400000000003
if you want me to talk a bit more

2819.8 --> 2822.6400000000003
positive about

2844.48 --> 2849.359
things yeah sure terret I'm sure he

2874.72 --> 2877.72
is

2892.68 --> 2895.04
okay

2899.119 --> 2907.6400000000003
teret is that the only difference what a

2902.76 --> 2907.6400000000003
crazy thing to say on that

2911.48 --> 2918.52
like that's the only difference the age

2913.44 --> 2918.52
Gap what the hell man that's that's not

2927.4 --> 2932.1600000000003
right right anyhow what can you

2934.599 --> 2937.599
do

2938.2 --> 2946.68
work harder has have

2940.76 --> 2951.0
less life more stress just work harder

2946.68 --> 2951.0
right find a better type of

2953.96 --> 2960.359
work right do what you love do what

2956.319 --> 2963.119
you're good in or do what you're good

2960.359 --> 2964.52
at that was what it was advised to me

2963.119 --> 2966.88
well I like

2964.52 --> 2969.4
talking that's what I always liked I

2966.88 --> 2971.1600000000003
like thinking I like considering I like

2969.4 --> 2974.64
pondering upon

2971.16 --> 2976.24
things I like to test people's minds

2974.64 --> 2979.319
it's what I like to do and that's why I

2976.24 --> 2983.24
do this that's why I'm over here it's

2979.319 --> 2985.72
just seems to be very little need for it

2983.24 --> 2988.9599999999996
these days

2985.72 --> 2992.2
though cuz I'm like yeah you can

2988.96 --> 2995.52
literally ask me any question like good

2992.2 --> 2996.96
questions bigger question like you can

2995.52 --> 2999.0
freaking ask me what's the [ __ ]

2996.96 --> 3001.4
meaning of life and I'll answer it for

2999.0 --> 3001.4
you

3004.44 --> 3009.319
yeah nobody comes here nobody [ __ ]

3021.68 --> 3027.52
cares they love my show oh everybody

3024.559 --> 3031.44
loves my show you love staring at me do

3027.52 --> 3031.44
you you love just staring at

3036.92 --> 3042.76
Arwin not asking

3039.88 --> 3044.88
questions not actually getting involved

3042.76 --> 3049.0400000000004
just staring at me are you're all such

3044.88 --> 3051.599
great fans that staring at me great

3049.04 --> 3051.599
[ __ ]

3054.44 --> 3057.44
great

3065.28 --> 3070.2000000000003
yeah teret

3067.64 --> 3073.839
what yeah that's been happening for

3070.2 --> 3073.839
quite a while years at this

3074.28 --> 3079.44
point he's a complete [ __ ] and he's

3077.92 --> 3082.0
[ __ ] banned

3079.44 --> 3086.0
here if I ever see him in person I

3082.0 --> 3089.16
[ __ ] beat him up that guy is like

3086.0 --> 3089.16
the horrendous

3089.72 --> 3097.04
scumbag I'm not even gonna try

3093.2 --> 3099.96
to imagine what he does outside of that

3097.04 --> 3102.599
[ __ ] in the real world I I think he's

3099.96 --> 3106.799
like a genuine disgusting

3102.599 --> 3106.799
scumbag and a pathological

3114.359 --> 3117.359
liar

3122.28 --> 3125.92
right the best you can do with him is

3124.079 --> 3129.92
just pretend he doesn't

3125.92 --> 3129.92
exist and then he kind of goes

3144.28 --> 3147.28
away

3159.079 --> 3164.92
yeah

3161.28 --> 3167.92
but yeah maybe maybe we shouldn't give a

3164.92 --> 3170.92
[ __ ] about these people at

3167.92 --> 3170.92
all

3171.52 --> 3178.0
freaks comination to no

3176.28 --> 3180.6400000000003
kind of a question is that why the hell

3178.0 --> 3180.64
would I know

3181.319 --> 3186.44
that you're the astrology guy here not

3204.16 --> 3210.44
me

3207.04 --> 3214.2799999999997
okay sun and

3210.44 --> 3214.28
R okay if you say

3234.16 --> 3237.16
so

3263.839 --> 3267.0789999999997
all right

3268.319 --> 3273.2
but yeah I mean who who the hell cares

3270.88 --> 3277.28
about [ __ ] Trump at this point

3273.2 --> 3277.2799999999997
man cares about any of

3277.599 --> 3282.04
those they're whole bunch of

3283.72 --> 3288.04
sellouts like all you have to do is just

3286.04 --> 3290.44
listen to a Dr Shiva stream and he'll

3288.04 --> 3293.04
tell you exactly what he's done like I

3290.44 --> 3295.599
don't remember the details of

3293.04 --> 3300.119
that but yeah Trump does a a whole bunch

3295.599 --> 3302.079
of terrible terrible terrible super pro

3300.119 --> 3305.52
deep state

3302.079 --> 3308.76
things did it all the time during his

3305.52 --> 3313.28
presidency he did it all the

3308.76 --> 3316.7990000000004
time he is the [ __ ] deep State guys

3313.28 --> 3319.44
Trump is the [ __ ] deep

3316.799 --> 3322.7599999999998
state it is

3319.44 --> 3326.039
him it's

3322.76 --> 3328.3590000000004
him he is their agent got all these

3326.039 --> 3331.7200000000003
things done for

3328.359 --> 3331.72
them all of

3332.079 --> 3337.799
it he did more things to back the Deep

3335.599 --> 3341.799
state in his presidency than like the

3337.799 --> 3341.799
the the three presidents before

3342.48 --> 3345.48
him

3346.72 --> 3353.8799999999997
yeah it's like he gleefully gave him

3351.079 --> 3357.44
like he wanted The Prestige of like no

3353.88 --> 3359.52
I'm better at cocking to the [ __ ]

3357.44 --> 3361.2400000000002
deep State and betraying everybody and

3359.52 --> 3363.88
pretending like I am exactly the

3361.24 --> 3366.8799999999997
opposite of what I really am to like the

3363.88 --> 3370.96
the degree where he doesn't even know

3366.88 --> 3373.0
he's not that actually that he actually

3370.96 --> 3375.2
starts to believe the delusion that he's

3373.0 --> 3376.24
weaving yeah that's the extremity this

3375.2 --> 3379.839
is

3376.24 --> 3379.839
taken with [ __ ]

3380.319 --> 3386.92
Trump he is the Deep State that's him

3384.4 --> 3386.92
that's the guy

3388.599 --> 3397.3590000000004
he probably did 9/11 too if you believe

3392.4 --> 3397.359
the certain pieces of

3413.88 --> 3420.28
research

3416.839 --> 3423.799
I have to understand why it's Sun okay

3420.28 --> 3423.799
do I have to understand

3443.799 --> 3446.799
that

3456.76 --> 3460.1600000000003
yeah Richard G but you don't really

3458.799 --> 3463.079
understand though

3460.16 --> 3466.3999999999996
that according to the Marxist

3463.079 --> 3468.2400000000002
logic white supremacy

3466.4 --> 3472.92
includes

3468.24 --> 3476.799
Jews dumbass sorry not you but you

3472.92 --> 3476.799
probably didn't realize that did you

3476.96 --> 3484.2
yeah cuz they don't have brown

3479.799 --> 3486.7599999999998
skin so they are white and he is by that

3484.2 --> 3489.839
standard of white

3486.76 --> 3491.559
supremacist it's just they just call

3489.839 --> 3494.799
that

3491.559 --> 3496.76
white they don't care that oh but it's

3494.799 --> 3498.359
they don't think of themselves as white

3496.76 --> 3500.6400000000003
even though they pretend to be to get

3498.359 --> 3504.7599999999998
control they thinks of themselves as

3500.64 --> 3509.2
Jews right well guess what the left does

3504.76 --> 3514.4

3509.2 --> 3514.3999999999996
white because that's convenient in the

own himself Trump is

3563.64 --> 3566.64
owned

3567.44 --> 3574.2400000000002
he's in so indebted like it's like

3571.4 --> 3577.4
technically impossible no matter what

3574.24 --> 3580.2799999999997
for him to get out of it yeah that's

3577.4 --> 3582.88
called not being in the ownership of

3580.28 --> 3582.88
your own

3584.96 --> 3589.2
soul there's nothing he can

3592.92 --> 3599.0

3604.44 --> 3612.16
ever except on his free time when he not

3608.24 --> 3615.4799999999996
being puppeted or be imp pretense about

sympathy sympathy

3642.96 --> 3648.799
reaping oh there must be attack yeah

3645.76 --> 3651.119
yeah it's part of it's industrial

3648.799 --> 3653.88
sympathy harvesting

3651.119 --> 3656.48
man it was it from the start why do you

3653.88 --> 3659.799
think that Trump so [ __ ] unfaced by

3656.48 --> 3664.4
all of it because it was his [ __ ]

3659.799 --> 3667.96
plan from the start it's a deep State

3664.4 --> 3671.0
operation yeah Trump derangement

3667.96 --> 3675.799
syndrome is a deep State

3671.0 --> 3678.039
operation that was planned with

3675.799 --> 3680.52
Trump it's the whole

3678.039 --> 3685.2000000000003
Spiel it's the

3680.52 --> 3687.319
format by which people see him and Ro

3685.2 --> 3691.2799999999997
him yeah

3687.319 --> 3694.2799999999997
preemptive coloring of the

3691.28 --> 3696.52
picture Trump didn't give everybody the

3694.28 --> 3698.7200000000003
room to just like naturally come to a

3696.52 --> 3701.24
conclusion about him no there had to be

3698.72 --> 3703.9199999999996
super anti-trump yelling

3701.24 --> 3705.5989999999997
people so that that is the thing that's

3703.92 --> 3709.599
going to shape your opinion about him

3705.599 --> 3711.52
not your actual calm concerted analysis

3709.599 --> 3713.44
of who he actually is and what he does

3711.52 --> 3717.16
and what his situation is

3713.44 --> 3720.76
no have to have giant yelling opposition

3717.16 --> 3723.5589999999997
on media all day long dude they did him

3720.76 --> 3726.8390000000004
a surface they did him a Surface by

3723.559 --> 3729.559
giving a cover a layer of [ __ ] that

3726.839 --> 3731.599
people refuse to dig through to see who

3729.559 --> 3737.2000000000003
he really

3731.599 --> 3740.48
is fake slander to cover for the actual

3737.2 --> 3743.359
[ __ ] they did him a favor the left did

3740.48 --> 3746.359
him a favor by doing

3743.359 --> 3746.359
that

3750.92 --> 3754.599
he probably wouldn't have made it very

3752.599 --> 3757.1600000000003
far if they hadn't and that's why I'm

3754.599 --> 3759.44
saying I think that Trump is actually a

3757.16 --> 3761.64
liberal he's just a liberal undercover

3759.44 --> 3763.839
of pretending to be a

3761.64 --> 3765.4
conservative and then when he gets in he

3763.839 --> 3767.839
[ __ ] that all

3765.4 --> 3769.96
up and then still pretends like he's

3767.839 --> 3773.92
doing a good job and people are just so

3769.96 --> 3775.319
desperate and dumb they just believe it

3773.92 --> 3777.52
it's like no no he's really trying to

3775.319 --> 3779.5589999999997
help yeah he just literally just [ __ ]

3777.52 --> 3782.0
this all up and scratched that and did

3779.559 --> 3787.119
that against everybody's recommendation

3782.0 --> 3790.359
but it's really just trying yes yeah

3787.119 --> 3794.079
it's called being a liberal infiltrator

3790.359 --> 3794.0789999999997

pretenses and I find out it was under

4348.48 --> 4354.08
false pretenses you're now more ban than

4358.8 --> 4364.639
ever how did you measure our

4361.96 --> 4368.2390000000005
SL uh

4364.639 --> 4370.4400000000005
well I I took an elevation angle to a to

4368.239 --> 4370.44
a

4370.96 --> 4379.4800000000005
baseline every time we do that that only

4373.8 --> 4379.4800000000005
works the Baseline is flat on a flat

4382.4 --> 4387.719
Earth yeah because doesn't work you

4384.96 --> 4391.92
can't take a curve from a from a curved

4387.719 --> 4398.2390000000005
Baseline literally get an error if you

4391.92 --> 4398.2390000000005
ask a computer to do that where is the

4400.12 --> 4405.36
basine at the

4402.36 --> 4405.36
horizon

4405.48 --> 4412.12
it's the flat plane that connects the

4408.679 --> 4412.12
horizons that we

4425.48 --> 4435.36
see you can do it under glob

4428.639 --> 4435.36
yeah I know Richard they always do that

4435.4 --> 4441.92
how do you establish that plane I don't

4439.12 --> 4446.12
know why don't you ask your questions at

4441.92 --> 4446.12
fed sure somebody will tell

4462.28 --> 4465.28
you

4470.0 --> 4475.28
but I think that it's the elevation the

4476.159 --> 4481.44
Baseline you take an angle to the

4482.08 --> 4488.28
Horizon correct

4484.239 --> 4491.638999999999
for the height above the

4488.28 --> 4495.28
ground and then you can take an angle to

4491.639 --> 4495.28
anything above that

4500.4 --> 4504.36
Baseline yes an angle

4521.44 --> 4525.36
duh and angles

4523.719 --> 4528.36
horizontal

4525.36 --> 4528.36
what

4528.679 --> 4532.04

4823.6 --> 4829.360000000001
rift they're just seeing Oh Arn's not

4826.12 --> 4832.92
doing too good maybe if we just try to

4829.36 --> 4836.159
ram on every every

4832.92 --> 4838.4800000000005
conceivable perceived potentially

4836.159 --> 4840.599999999999
vulnerable spot if we just RAM on all of

4838.48 --> 4842.239
it maybe he'll just [ __ ] blow up and

4840.6 --> 4844.280000000001
kill himself or something or do

4842.239 --> 4848.28
something criminal and then and then we

4844.28 --> 4851.84
can say ah see Fed bad like I do

4848.28 --> 4854.8
actually think that people that consider

4851.84 --> 4857.28
themselves my and fed's opponents

4854.8 --> 4860.0
actually do think like

4857.28 --> 4863.48
that they will never admit it they'll

4860.0 --> 4866.28
never admit to being fully demonic and

4863.48 --> 4869.678999999999
like that they might not even be fully

4866.28 --> 4871.5599999999995
conscious about them being fully demonic

4869.679 --> 4875.679
like that but the demon

4871.56 --> 4875.679
will take them and do

4878.679 --> 4885.08
it so they push themselves in my face to

4882.12 --> 4885.08
try to make it

4897.199 --> 4903.199
worse right but

4900.04 --> 4906.5199999999995
uh my crankiness could very well be

4903.199 --> 4906.5199999999995
helped very

4906.56 --> 4911.639
quickly by the prospect of not being

4909.84 --> 4914.639
hungry

4911.639 --> 4914.639
tomorrow

4914.8 --> 4920.679
I really look forward to the idea of not

4917.679 --> 4923.6
being hungry tomorrow

4920.679 --> 4927.719
you The

4923.6 --> 4930.719
Listener the viewer the

4927.719 --> 4933.04
fan the concerned

4930.719 --> 4936.32
citizen whatever the hell you are you

4933.04 --> 4936.32
could really help me out

4938.159 --> 4943.44
here

4940.28 --> 4946.48
yeah prices are all going to the

4943.44 --> 4950.919999999999
hell it's

4946.48 --> 4950.919999999999
terrible energy costs is

4951.28 --> 4961.04
terrible I can't eat from the money I

4956.52 --> 4961.040000000001
get I can't do it it's not

4969.32 --> 4974.04
enough I try to manage I try to be

4972.04 --> 4976.56
really tight TI and I am I'm really

4974.04 --> 4980.32
tight with my food there's no food

4976.56 --> 4986.080000000001
wasted none at all I'm I've gotten very

4980.32 --> 4990.5599999999995
efficient I've rearranged like my taste

4986.08 --> 4992.239
entirely oh not like really far though

4990.56 --> 4994.280000000001
there's some things that are just like

4992.239 --> 4997.759999999999
not going to do

4994.28 --> 5001.48
that you could go Mega cheap but I mean

4997.76 --> 5004.280000000001
that that that would be threatening to

5001.48 --> 5006.839999999999
me to take it that

5004.28 --> 5008.5599999999995
far like I wouldn't not be able to do

5006.84 --> 5010.679
that alone maybe if I had somebody to do

5008.56 --> 5013.120000000001
it with then maybe but I'm not gonna do

5010.679 --> 5016.4800000000005
that a l but I've become very

5013.12 --> 5019.44
efficient with my cooking and really

5016.48 --> 5022.08
changed my overall food habits to become

5019.44 --> 5026.599999999999
more basic more oldfashioned anyway like

5022.08 --> 5028.92
I literally eat very oldfashioned type

5026.6 --> 5032.92
food like this

5028.92 --> 5035.32
is how my parents used to cook even and

5032.92 --> 5037.04
now I get it why they always use to cook

5035.32 --> 5038.799999999999
that kind of stuff it's because like

5037.04 --> 5041.4
yeah it really

5038.8 --> 5044.8
works it's not that expensive it's

5041.4 --> 5044.799999999999
pretty simple but it really

5051.56 --> 5056.52
works right but it doesn't work if you

5054.199 --> 5060.32
can't pay for potatoes you can't pay for

5056.52 --> 5063.88
beef sausage and you can't pay for

5060.32 --> 5066.199
butter then it doesn't work

5063.88 --> 5070.08
I got the

5066.199 --> 5070.08
Beats but I don't have the

5079.239 --> 5084.159
rest all the tappy trolls yeah it's

5082.32 --> 5085.639
probably zpp tap y zpp tappy is

5084.159 --> 5088.799999999999
permanently banned I don't want to see

5085.639 --> 5091.36
that disgusting [ __ ] here

5088.8 --> 5095.52
again all he would have had to do is

5091.36 --> 5098.28
like support me financially just

5095.52 --> 5102.679
once and I wouldn't have regarded him as

5098.28 --> 5106.239
like a permanent [ __ ] troll

5102.679 --> 5106.2390000000005
Hazard but he

5108.85 --> 5111.929

5286.84 --> 5293.8
questions about angles and Horizons and

5290.04 --> 5296.8
elevation angles you could ask me I'm

5293.8 --> 5300.400000000001

into the past

5319.32 --> 5325.679
no now ter you can actually check their

5323.199 --> 5327.839999999999
activity as a moderator and then you can

5325.679 --> 5333.1990000000005
see when they were made like I'm pretty

5327.84 --> 5336.0
sure that's not a zap tappy sock so

5333.199 --> 5336.0
don't worry about

5360.92 --> 5363.92
it

5368.159 --> 5374.28
right but hey any other technical

5371.84 --> 5377.400000000001

5374.28 --> 5379.04
answer them if you're really going to go

5377.4 --> 5382.4
by like

5379.04 --> 5388.199

glad you're able

6102.119 --> 6108.36
to cuz I mean in the time when it wasn't

6105.76 --> 6111.360000000001
all this freaking Financial Siege on the

6108.36 --> 6113.159
western world I did actually get get

6111.36 --> 6116.119
support more regularly

6113.159 --> 6119.92
because I do actually think that lots of

6116.119 --> 6121.839999999999
you guys do want to support me it's just

6119.92 --> 6125.719
that you really

6121.84 --> 6125.719
can't and that really

6126.36 --> 6130.0
sucks for all of

6130.28 --> 6134.0
us

6131.88 --> 6137.4800000000005
so I'm going

6134.0 --> 6139.599
to I'm going to do a bit of a joke here

6137.48 --> 6141.759999999999
but I mean there's a point behind it but

6139.599 --> 6143.679
I mean every everybody always keeps

6141.76 --> 6146.280000000001
telling me in the chat like you get a

6143.679 --> 6148.679
job Arn you get a job well why don't you

6146.28 --> 6148.679
get a

6149.52 --> 6157.92
job see how easy that is you get it and

6154.48 --> 6157.919999999999
then you can help people

6158.04 --> 6164.199
out instead of just telling them to get

6160.639 --> 6167.04
a job right I mean if it's that

6164.199 --> 6169.32
easy maybe you have a job to offer me

6167.04 --> 6171.08
I've said it before in the past I'm like

6169.32 --> 6172.92
yeah dude that sounds really cool cool

6171.08 --> 6175.639
job all that yeah yeah so do you want me

6172.92 --> 6179.719

6175.639 --> 6181.76
3 years like trying to get a job like

6179.719 --> 6183.36
trying it and not getting it because I

6181.76 --> 6184.639
don't have a resume that really is

6183.36 --> 6187.4
useful

6184.639 --> 6189.4400000000005
I'm probably overqualified

6187.4 --> 6193.04
intellectually about

6189.44 --> 6196.199
anything and not enough experience for

6193.04 --> 6198.599
the those types of jobs it it's just a

6196.199 --> 6201.5199999999995
disaster so it's like oh you want me to

6198.599 --> 6205.119000000001

6383.96 --> 6390.119
TimeWise how long I size up I can

6390.119 --> 6395.36
what I'd get out of it financially

6391.88 --> 6398.159000000001
compared to now all those things will be

6395.36 --> 6399.88
measured and then we'll see if that is

6398.159 --> 6402.119
acceptable if the job offer is

6399.88 --> 6406.4800000000005
acceptable if it makes any damn sense if

6402.119 --> 6409.08
it will give me any form of progress

6406.48 --> 6412.4
whatsoever right because I take it all

6409.08 --> 6412.4
very serious

6421.44 --> 6427.919999999999
so it's just that simple right and

money all the time yeah well there's

6439.679 --> 6444.2390000000005
another way that make me stop whining

6441.56 --> 6448.119000000001
about money and it's actually supporting

6444.239 --> 6451.44
me just doing it I'll talk about other

6448.119 --> 6454.04
things then I won't bring up oh I want

6466.719 --> 6470.88
stop what skills do I

6469.32 --> 6475.599
possess

6470.88 --> 6479.2390000000005
uh I have a wide platora of

6475.599 --> 6482.96
verbal communication

6479.239 --> 6482.959999999999
skills learning

6484.28 --> 6491.88
psychology can I catch a

6487.679 --> 6493.52
fish no I mean I could but I definitely

6491.88 --> 6496.400000000001
don't want to do that because that

6493.52 --> 6498.280000000001
sounds boring as [ __ ] my dad used to

6496.4 --> 6501.239
like the fish and he invited me I

6498.28 --> 6504.759999999999
declined why because it's [ __ ] boring

6501.239 --> 6507.759999999999
I don't want to just sit somewhere for

6504.76 --> 6511.76
hours

6507.76 --> 6515.56
G yeah I mean if you need to me oh you

6511.76 --> 6517.96
want to work in my store like no not

6515.56 --> 6519.88
really it makes [ __ ] and I'm just

6517.96 --> 6521.28
standing there being bored out of my

6519.88 --> 6524.599
mind all

6521.28 --> 6527.96
day mostly

6524.599 --> 6530.88
probably right unless it's like

6527.96 --> 6532.32
something like it's really working out

6530.88 --> 6534.36
and it's like a lot of customers and

6532.32 --> 6537.36
then I'd be busy all the time then I'd

6534.36 --> 6538.839999999999
be like yeah yeah if if I can make a

6537.36 --> 6542.199
decent amount of money out of that and

6538.84 --> 6544.04
it'll be busy all the time that sounds

6542.199 --> 6546.159
interesting if it's just going to be

6544.04 --> 6548.32
some stupid job that you're going to be

6546.159 --> 6552.638999999999
bought out of your mind with and not

6548.32 --> 6552.639
barely get paid anything that

6554.36 --> 6562.119
sucks like that sucks worse than being

6559.119 --> 6562.119
poor

6562.4 --> 6567.839999999999
for me I mean it's probably very doable

6565.84 --> 6570.32
for a lot of people out there that have

6567.84 --> 6572.4400000000005
a family and then it works and actually

6570.32 --> 6575.44
get a bit of profit out of it that's

6572.44 --> 6578.44
cool man yeah that doesn't work with

6575.44 --> 6583.36
me I don't have that I don't have a

6578.44 --> 6583.36
family to hook into like that and it

6589.119 --> 6594.36
just

6591.679 --> 6596.92
tour guide for englishspeaking tourists

6594.36 --> 6599.08
absolutely I could do that actually D

6596.92 --> 6601.4400000000005
for Dan na Evette I could actually do

6599.08 --> 6601.44
that

6605.239 --> 6612.04
yes that's kind of funny I never even

6608.28 --> 6615.88
thought of that but yeah I could do that

6612.04 --> 6619.32
and not only that I could actually help

6615.88 --> 6621.159000000001
English people speak Dutch like I could

6619.32 --> 6624.32
really do that

6621.159 --> 6626.92
I can even do it to the degree where

6624.32 --> 6629.04
eventually if they make enough effort if

6626.92 --> 6632.76
it's important enough and I could make

6629.04 --> 6635.639
English or even Americans speak Dutch in

6632.76 --> 6637.84
a way that you almost wouldn't recognize

6635.639 --> 6639.8
that they're not Dutch I could get them

6637.84 --> 6644.400000000001
to that degree it's going to take a

6639.8 --> 6646.28
while though but yes language I can do a

6644.4 --> 6648.679
lot with that it's not a [ __ ]

6646.28 --> 6650.84
crossbow

6648.679 --> 6653.4400000000005
[ __ ] I'm going to going to like put

illegal you can't have a [ __ ]

6733.199 --> 6739.079
crossbow here it's dangerous yeah a bow

6737.239 --> 6740.919999999999
is one thing you could do that yeah

6739.079 --> 6743.5599999999995
crossbow no

6740.92 --> 6745.96
no and it isn't a crossbow it's not what

6743.56 --> 6748.96
a crossbow looks like there's no

6745.96 --> 6751.52
crossbow in the world that looks like

6748.96 --> 6754.8
that yeah it's a

6751.52 --> 6757.040000000001
bow yeah crossbows don't have like the

6754.8 --> 6759.92
middle piece

6757.04 --> 6763.639
disjointed yeah that's not a crossbow

6759.92 --> 6767.639
it's a bow and the quiver is hanging

6763.639 --> 6768.84
there in the middle of the bow yeah not

6767.639 --> 6771.639
a

6768.84 --> 6773.52
crossbow not a crossbow yeah that's not

6771.639 --> 6775.76
a

6773.52 --> 6778.280000000001
crossbow there is no crossbow in the

6775.76 --> 6780.88
world that looks like that that's not a

6778.28 --> 6782.759999999999
crossbow it's a bow not a crossbow

6780.88 --> 6785.400000000001
crossbows don't look like that there's

6782.76 --> 6789.88
no crossbows in the [ __ ] world that

6785.4 --> 6797.239
under any circumstance look like this

6789.88 --> 6797.2390000000005
not a crossbow it's a bow a bow AOW AOW

6798.76 --> 6801.76
AOW

6804.679 --> 6811.88
H you're going to get a [ __ ] timeout

6807.04 --> 6811.88
for that if you keep that up C

6828.76 --> 6831.76
zillion

6835.48 --> 6840.638999999999
yeah teret but orino was kind of right

6841.88 --> 6847.639
though

6844.0 --> 6850.28
just bro you support me then and then

6847.639 --> 6852.36
you can speak to him on equal footing he

6850.28 --> 6855.5599999999995
actually just supported me something I

6852.36 --> 6858.5599999999995
desperately needed D

6855.56 --> 6858.56
it

6858.679 --> 6861.679
okay

6863.4 --> 6868.839999999999
I think that's what confuses

6866.32 --> 6871.5599999999995
people there is no crossbow in the world

6868.84 --> 6871.56
that looks like

6888.679 --> 6892.96
that

6890.76 --> 6895.0
it's a little hard to see it's a quiver

6892.96 --> 6897.4
yeah well it's also because of just the

6895.0 --> 6899.8
angle right I mean the bow is not fully

6897.4 --> 6904.679
on screen all the time because I like to

6899.8 --> 6904.679
kind of aim the camera a bit to the

6905.0 --> 6909.199
outside it's a better angle for

6918.599 --> 6924.4800000000005
me

6920.32 --> 6924.48
oh God Jared

6945.079 --> 6953.159
just yeah yeah the arimus [ __ ] yeah yeah

6947.92 --> 6956.8
yeah D it but I mean

6953.159 --> 6960.079
yeah and the arimus is

6956.8 --> 6960.079000000001
just just

6960.48 --> 6965.04
disaster didn't like something blow up

6963.28 --> 6967.44
recently I don't know man I I kind of

6965.04 --> 6968.96
lost track of all that crap it's kind of

6967.44 --> 6970.839999999999
like moved into the background which is

6968.96 --> 6972.92
a good indication that maybe something

6970.84 --> 6975.079
did actually blow up because then I

6972.92 --> 6977.96
really don't like to put it in your face

6975.079 --> 6980.239
again unless they specifically want to

6977.96 --> 6982.28
cancel something I don't think that's

6980.239 --> 6985.678999999999
the case and they just want to cancel

6982.28 --> 6988.44
like people's ability to work they don't

6985.679 --> 6990.92
want to cancel like grossly money

6988.44 --> 6994.799999999999
wasting stupid projects that get us

6990.92 --> 6997.56
nowhere they just want to waste

6994.8 --> 7001.8
money of people that actually are

6997.56 --> 7001.8
capable of doing something durable with

7008.48 --> 7011.48
it

7028.88 --> 7032.76
oh man I can't believe the time's

7030.28 --> 7035.48
already done I barely even talked about

7032.76 --> 7038.400000000001
liberal infil trator Zionist controlled

7035.48 --> 7041.5599999999995
opposition deep state agent

7038.4 --> 7045.5199999999995
Trump but I guess I don't really need to

7041.56 --> 7047.4400000000005
say that much I mean the title kind of

7045.52 --> 7050.360000000001
speaks for itself it's already the

7047.44 --> 7050.36
indicator

7050.48 --> 7055.678999999999
right I'm just it's all so

7058.0 --> 7063.0
tiresome it's like I want to like Trump

7060.76 --> 7064.8
but then I always keep finding out like

7063.0 --> 7068.0
yeah but he did this and did that like

7064.8 --> 7070.8
oh wow those are like the worst most

7068.0 --> 7073.28
disastrous progress of the

7070.8 --> 7076.8
enemy and he just did that and nobody

7073.28 --> 7078.84
even noticed and I'm like just oh my God

7076.8 --> 7081.28
it makes me kind of

7078.84 --> 7085.2390000000005
blackpilled it's the one thing about Dr

7081.28 --> 7085.239
Shiva sometimes it's like he

7086.719 --> 7092.84
just he just does that and so today is a

7091.32 --> 7095.239
show like

7092.84 --> 7097.679
this hey but at least I got like 10

7095.239 --> 7101.119
bucks out of it so I can eat tomorrow

7097.679 --> 7103.4400000000005
that's nice

7101.119 --> 7106.0
can't complain too

7103.44 --> 7108.799999999999
much but I really do hope that there's

7106.0 --> 7112.56
going to be a bit

7108.8 --> 7115.04
more the rest of the week because

7112.56 --> 7117.88
otherwise I'm going to have a bad bad

7115.04 --> 7120.96
time this

7117.88 --> 7125.599
month so really I hope you guys can

7120.96 --> 7125.599
somehow figure out how to support

7128.32 --> 7133.759999999999
me and I know you have and if I feel

7131.8 --> 7135.639
kind of shitty telling you every time I

7133.76 --> 7137.76
need support now when you're just like a

7135.639 --> 7139.719
month ago you supported me I know you

7137.76 --> 7143.04
did unfortunately it's like a

7139.719 --> 7146.96
reoccurring thing for

7143.04 --> 7151.079
now and it's just like yeah I I I just

7146.96 --> 7151.079
that's just what's required I I'm

7154.56 --> 7161.599
sorry right but hey if you can figure

7159.36 --> 7164.799999999999
out a job that would actually like get

7161.599 --> 7168.84
me out of this situation

7164.8 --> 7172.1990000000005
financially like where I make Surplus

7168.84 --> 7174.360000000001
like more than welfare would then yeah

7172.199 --> 7177.638999999999
that's cool if you got that to offer me

7174.36 --> 7180.44
I will probably take it at this

7177.639 --> 7184.159000000001
point cuz I sure as hell don't want to

7180.44 --> 7186.199
like live permanently in unpayable debt

7184.159 --> 7188.92
that's something I definitely don't want

7186.199 --> 7191.4
so if somebody does actually have a job

7188.92 --> 7194.639
offer for yeah discontinue the early bir

7191.4 --> 7198.04
show probably well if it it would help

7194.639 --> 7201.599
me prevent getting in uncontrollable

7198.04 --> 7206.28
debt then yeah I'll take it I'll [ __ ]

7201.599 --> 7208.1990000000005
take it at this point yeah

7206.28 --> 7209.84
somebody like somebody's going to

7208.199 --> 7212.159
actually offer that to me that's

7209.84 --> 7215.639
hilarious no it doesn't work that way I

7212.159 --> 7217.839999999999
know you only offer people stuff if they

7215.639 --> 7219.719
give you your soul and that means they

7217.84 --> 7221.52
do it exactly

7219.719 --> 7225.159
everything in their life the way that

7221.52 --> 7227.159000000001
you want to you want it I know it works

7225.159 --> 7229.159
like that so I'm not going to get a job

7227.159 --> 7231.598999999999
offer like that that's only reserved for

7229.159 --> 7234.799999999999
people that are willing to sell their

7231.599 --> 7237.28
souls I know

7234.8 --> 7239.079000000001
that that's why I'm not actually

7237.28 --> 7242.0
seriously hoping for it because I know

7239.079 --> 7242.0
it doesn't work like

7246.92 --> 7251.119
that but hey

7252.96 --> 7256.679

7257.48 --> 7263.678999999999
