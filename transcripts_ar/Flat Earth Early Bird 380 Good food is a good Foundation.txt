151.099 --> 156.42999999999998
and the Me's Kang sorry to Cosentino

157.629 --> 172.01
yeah good to see you all so uh I went to

166.67 --> 178.54
bed early yesterday but I did manage to

172.01 --> 182.84
catch Owen Benjamin on D life again and

178.54 --> 188.72
yeah was good he seems to have a lot

182.84 --> 191.359
less trouble with that platform at like

188.72 --> 192.95
if I were to get into some kind of

191.359 --> 196.04000000000002
trouble with YouTube and I hope I don't

192.95 --> 200.53
then I will definitely also go there I

196.04 --> 203.15
even already have an account for there I

200.53 --> 205.489
think I could probably switch it pretty

203.15 --> 209.47
quickly but yeah I wasn't really

205.489 --> 212.65
planning on leaving YouTube just yet

209.47 --> 216.079
first let's see what happens the 10th I

212.65 --> 220.34
am as advised by Nathan yesterday

216.079 --> 223.97
downloading all the shows because yeah

220.34 --> 226.43
it could just all be suddenly just

223.97 --> 229.04
squished like that I don't know I hope

226.43 --> 237.53
not I haven't gotten any kind of warning

229.04 --> 240.489
and I read through the rules so yeah

237.53 --> 240.489
we'll see what happens

257.19 --> 264.98
marked for child usage what that doesn't

262.41 --> 264.98
make any sense

272.49 --> 275.389
I get it

292.26 --> 297.26
right anyway yeah I'm working on that

303.68 --> 308.389
yeah I had another good talk with my

306.02 --> 312.5
healer again just before the show or

308.389 --> 315.229
well a roughly an hour before and got me

312.5 --> 319.94
thinking again about my diet it was very

315.229 --> 323.78
weird because it was kind of

319.94 --> 327.68
contradictive two things I saw but yeah

323.78 --> 330.5
the guy is very very widely studied like

327.68 --> 332.21
part of the reason he is busy and can

330.5 --> 334.61
always contact it's just because he

332.21 --> 340.60999999999996
keeps informing himself he's like really

334.61 --> 344.51
studying so much and including about

340.61 --> 345.97900000000004
diet and he just gave me some like he

344.51 --> 352.37
asked me like you have what blood type

345.979 --> 358.01
are you and I'm like oh I keep on

352.37 --> 360.979
forgetting that [ __ ] but we basically

358.01 --> 363.40999999999997
did guesswork and he told me some things

360.979 --> 370.31
that I hadn't really expected about my

363.41 --> 373.06
own diet about meat he said that

370.31 --> 377.169
depending on your blood type that

373.06 --> 380.15
certain blood types would typically

377.169 --> 382.13
prefer chicken now I did this is about

380.15 --> 384.13899999999995
yeah we're talking about meat eating now

382.13 --> 386.81
but it was very interesting so I'm gonna

384.139 --> 388.49
relay roughly what I got from it and I'm

386.81 --> 391.43
actually kind of disappointed that I

388.49 --> 394.40000000000003
seemed a little fairy bill didn't seem

391.43 --> 397.28000000000003
to know very little about this so but

394.4 --> 402.73999999999995
what he said was I think blood groups a

397.28 --> 406.729
and B would typically not need meat so

402.74 --> 409.43
much and but they would eat chicken

406.729 --> 413.83
because that is lighter to digest but at

409.43 --> 417.77
the same time more regular groups then

413.83 --> 422.38
they actually don't really get that much

417.77 --> 422.38
from it so he said like yeah

424.43 --> 432.0
lamps meat or beef I was like what beef

428.19 --> 434.75
movie but apparently yeah so I'm gonna

432.0 --> 437.91
again go empirically test that a little

434.75 --> 445.11
but it gave me some stuff to think upon

437.91 --> 447.66
and that's good yeah do whatever you

445.11 --> 450.42
feel it's necessary but yeah I have I've

447.66 --> 454.14000000000004
been over over a year vegetarian almost

450.42 --> 456.54
1/2 years now pretty strictly except for

454.14 --> 458.87
the fish oil that I take and I have

456.54 --> 466.14000000000004
taken like chicken broth sometimes and

458.87 --> 470.22
chicken soup but very sparsely but maybe

466.14 --> 472.86
yeah I have had some like responses

470.22 --> 475.17
again to when I smell certain type of

472.86 --> 477.93
meat and the weird thing was at least at

475.17 --> 481.44
first half year entirely I just did not

477.93 --> 483.18
have any cravings whatsoever like it

481.44 --> 486.0
just didn't hit me and where it's like

483.18 --> 490.59000000000003
oh wow this makes so much sense yeah I'm

486.0 --> 494.43
vegetarian but in the recent months for

490.59 --> 496.04999999999995
some reason it like the the call started

494.43 --> 499.77
to come up again so I may need to

496.05 --> 503.43
assimilate some very specific type and

499.77 --> 506.31
maybe sporadically I'm really going with

503.43 --> 510.92
health I'm not doing any of this for any

506.31 --> 514.38
type of principle that is based on

510.92 --> 516.09
sentience ER or all that although I have

514.38 --> 519.95
a general goodwill towards all living

516.09 --> 525.27
beings even the ones that would be eaten

519.95 --> 527.1600000000001
but yeah I'm gonna try somehow I also

525.27 --> 529.8
gonna talk to my dad because I'm pretty

527.16 --> 533.62
sure he knows my blood type then I can

529.8 --> 537.43
cross-reference what was said

533.62 --> 541.54
and yeah because I do kind of feel also

537.43 --> 545.53
I've been getting very mild though but

541.54 --> 547.7199999999999
headaches also and that's something

545.53 --> 551.74
that's very unusual for me because I

547.72 --> 556.39
like and really never have them unless I

551.74 --> 557.92
totally rage out get really pissed off

556.39 --> 559.21
and then the next day I will have a bit

557.92 --> 563.3499999999999
of a headache but that's it

559.21 --> 568.12
but yeah like even in stormy times in

563.35 --> 569.89
the last five years at least yeah I

568.12 --> 572.47
might feel really shitty or something

569.89 --> 576.28
but that's different but the headache

572.47 --> 582.73
type sensation no I never get those so

576.28 --> 589.03
maybe I do need some specific type of

582.73 --> 591.04
protein because I got to keep on trying

589.03 --> 596.26
things that I got to keep on improving I

591.04 --> 598.3
I am so rusty in my way so easily set

596.26 --> 599.83
just do the same thing over and over

598.3 --> 605.77
again followed the same pattern over and

599.83 --> 609.7900000000001
over again but I feel that I feel I need

605.77 --> 612.37
to keep on making at least slight

609.79 --> 619.3
changes and see if I can get a better

612.37 --> 622.47
purity better focus and maybe get a

619.3 --> 622.4699999999999
little better momentum

629.52 --> 636.84
[Music]

631.9 --> 636.84
I don't know Capri Capri castle

643.34 --> 649.76
I'm gonna see what happens look if it

645.65 --> 652.55
doesn't work it doesn't work that's the

649.76 --> 654.95
whole point of testing it I know I'm not

652.55 --> 657.5899999999999
gonna like get violently ill from it

654.95 --> 660.95
because I've grown up with me eating so

657.59 --> 665.44
I can my physiology has been adapted to

660.95 --> 665.44
do that I'm just not used to it anymore

669.85 --> 676.25
and by the way whatever I'm gonna be

673.4 --> 679.25
trying out does not mean absolutely not

676.25 --> 682.45
that I'm suddenly just gonna start

679.25 --> 686.18
eating meat like every day oh no no way

682.45 --> 688.779
it's not how I do that that's not how

686.18 --> 688.779
I'm gonna do that

709.55 --> 720.75
life doctor right well I I don't know

717.66 --> 723.0
any of those I don't have any money to

720.75 --> 727.47
start seeking one out and getting

723.0 --> 728.97
official advice so yeah I'm not going to

727.47 --> 732.4200000000001
any kind of doctor even though I know

728.97 --> 735.21
there might be some very specialized

732.42 --> 740.43
people out there in in a direction that

735.21 --> 741.33
I can go with yeah they are expensive

740.43 --> 746.43
yep

741.33 --> 749.94
so yes you know that's that's for

746.43 --> 753.5699999999999
another level I gotta do this myself

749.94 --> 762.8900000000001
first and I'm gonna go with my intuition

753.57 --> 762.8900000000001
and with empiricism very important

779.9 --> 783.16
all right anyway

790.47 --> 796.44
you could kind of like compare it to

793.82 --> 798.9300000000001
animal feeding habits as well it's just

796.44 --> 802.11
certain type of periods in the year

798.93 --> 804.9
where a lot of my animals suddenly start

802.11 --> 809.88
diverting their normal diets into other

804.9 --> 813.66
types of diets certain types of mammals

809.88 --> 816.51
may start to suddenly eat clay a lot it

813.66 --> 819.2099999999999
also depends on the how how well things

816.51 --> 822.12
are spread out but there's just cycles

819.21 --> 824.1
in eating and I think that certain

822.12 --> 827.34
period well probably during the

824.1 --> 829.95
wintertime the body may have some extra

827.34 --> 835.6800000000001
need from for very specific type of

829.95 --> 839.63
nutrients and maybe that is this kind of

835.68 --> 839.63
maybe that is what this is

866.589 --> 871.259
dark green vegetables as protein yeah I

869.079 --> 871.2589999999999
know

878.88 --> 882.62
[Music]

887.57 --> 892.5200000000001
yeah look to everyone out there that's

890.46 --> 895.2900000000001
been following me for some time

892.52 --> 897.21
vegetarianism has always been more like

895.29 --> 902.4599999999999
an experiment to me because I've always

897.21 --> 905.97
stood for very average sensible and the

902.46 --> 907.95
way of approaching food just make it all

905.97 --> 912.5400000000001
yourself get it again and get filtered

907.95 --> 916.4300000000001
water and use a lot of vegetables and if

912.54 --> 919.65
you like me then use it sparsely don't

916.43 --> 924.3499999999999
make it the the multitude of some meal

919.65 --> 924.35
that's better if you don't and

927.49 --> 934.42
yeah to each their own that's been

932.559 --> 939.49
always the most sensible average to me

934.42 --> 942.2489999999999
and that is what I used to do although I

939.49 --> 946.23
did kind of eat meat every day and maybe

942.249 --> 946.23
that's never gonna come back like that

946.74 --> 953.649
but this pure vegetarianism I don't know

950.86 --> 955.66
if it if it is durable for the long run

953.649 --> 957.55
for me but yeah we'll see where it goes

955.66 --> 960.519
I'm gonna try out some meat at some

957.55 --> 963.309
point don't know exactly when maybe it's

960.519 --> 967.899
somewhere this week or in the weekend

963.309 --> 970.899
and we'll see what happens maybe my body

967.899 --> 971.29
will be revolting because of it I don't

970.899 --> 973.929
know

971.29 --> 979.139
I really haven't the last time I tried

973.929 --> 983.35
was during Christmas last year I think

979.139 --> 986.759
right now wait I'm vegetarian two years

983.35 --> 991.809
it doesn't make any sense

986.759 --> 993.999
last year we did a eat vegetarian and a

991.809 --> 998.16
year before that I ate chicken as an

993.999 --> 998.16
exemption from being

999.209 --> 1003.149
vegetarian and I didn't like it that's

1001.41 --> 1007.1
why last year we didn't yeah I'm

1003.149 --> 1010.94
vegetarian for two and a half years Wow

1007.1 --> 1010.94
our time flies

1015.61 --> 1018.96
right right

1026.089 --> 1029.089
anyway

1032.22 --> 1041.06
pair off your meals are vegetarian well

1035.94 --> 1044.46
that's fine I think that's actually very

1041.06 --> 1049.71
sensible for a lot of people is to just

1044.46 --> 1053.82
be vegetarian sometimes and meat for

1049.71 --> 1057.39
other times I'd use meat meals

1053.82 --> 1059.49
especially at the start of when you're

1057.39 --> 1068.15
when you got a lot of time to rest on

1059.49 --> 1071.73
your hands so like maybe after work week

1068.15 --> 1074.16
you know and then get some yeah you know

1071.73 --> 1076.89
something to look forward to also if you

1074.16 --> 1079.8000000000002
really like it and then you can really

1076.89 --> 1084.0600000000002
like chill out after that for the

1079.8 --> 1087.27
weekend and not be forcing yourself to

1084.06 --> 1089.1499999999999
despite still digesting all that meat go

1087.27 --> 1092.4
hard at it again because that can

1089.15 --> 1097.67
potentially slowly build up with

1092.4 --> 1097.67
problems so I don't know

1101.55 --> 1105.83
right YouTube but they have to

1107.93 --> 1116.0900000000001
and I have to say so far from a lot of

1111.86 --> 1119.12
organic vegetarian things in the in the

1116.09 --> 1121.8799999999999
store they have made it a lot more

1119.12 --> 1125.809
appealing in the last ten years a lot

1121.88 --> 1128.1100000000001
more like in the start of that some of

1125.809 --> 1131.24
that stuff was like really disgusting

1128.11 --> 1135.1399999999999
but it was experimental I guess and they

1131.24 --> 1140.24
managed to improve it greatly it is

1135.14 --> 1141.5590000000002
actually kind of tasty yeah some of it

1140.24 --> 1144.13
some of the things that I have tried

1141.559 --> 1144.1299999999999
recently

1158.1 --> 1162.06
I just depending where I live

1160.26 --> 1165.24
temperature weather yeah well Robin

1162.06 --> 1167.52
Stanley that makes sense you need

1165.24 --> 1173.73
different substances for different

1167.52 --> 1176.1
weather conditions so I imagine if

1173.73 --> 1182.85
you're gonna go to a very cold region

1176.1 --> 1191.27
you'd want some regular fat and enough

1182.85 --> 1191.27
minerals to accompany that

1191.79 --> 1201.42
so you can withstand the cold and your

1194.19 --> 1203.46
skin will need all that fat but yeah if

1201.42 --> 1207.42
you're somewhere a very hot region then

1203.46 --> 1211.41
high fat it will not be so very nice

1207.42 --> 1214.5800000000002
you probably want more fluids and well

1211.41 --> 1216.78
the assimilation probably have more

1214.58 --> 1221.97
vitamins and all that through that so

1216.78 --> 1224.52
fruits will probably be absolutely great

1221.97 --> 1226.1100000000001
in the tropical regions while surprise

1224.52 --> 1231.78
surprise there's a lot of fruits there

1226.11 --> 1236.9399999999998
and people eat it so yeah for every

1231.78 --> 1239.96
region it's very likely you will end up

1236.94 --> 1239.96
adapting your diet

1252.87 --> 1260.6899999999998
who I'll that sounds delicious

1256.11 --> 1260.6899999999998
more color nice

1268.96 --> 1273.909
yeah good veggie stuff can be great

1299.5 --> 1311.08
well yeah start talking about food the

1308.59 --> 1313.539
at Tom Parker coconut oil can be better

1311.08 --> 1319.809
it depends though it really depends on

1313.539 --> 1323.01
the type of person for me olive oil

1319.809 --> 1325.539
works great but if I'd make something

1323.01 --> 1330.78
for me personally that counts if I make

1325.539 --> 1334.299
something more Asian Indonesian or

1330.78 --> 1337.48
something with rice then I'll then I'll

1334.299 --> 1340.36
definitely very quickly go to using

1337.48 --> 1343.059
coconut fat as a basis instead of olive

1340.36 --> 1345.01
oil because it works really well

1343.059 --> 1347.97
together with the spices that are

1345.01 --> 1347.97
typically used there

1360.17 --> 1366.98
but yeah my general cooking tastes tend

1364.58 --> 1370.82
to go for a typical Mediterranean type

1366.98 --> 1373.88
of things like spaghetti like pizzas a

1370.82 --> 1376.6399999999999
lot but I make them myself yeah I don't

1373.88 --> 1380.0600000000002
just get some prefab no I I get the

1376.64 --> 1386.5400000000002
bottom and then I just put it all on

1380.06 --> 1390.26
there good stuff as much fresh vegetable

1386.54 --> 1394.58
as possible like fresh basil also from

1390.26 --> 1398.74
my own plant that I keep track of and

1394.58 --> 1401.1599999999999
one more chili I do like chili sometimes

1398.74 --> 1404.279
comes and goes

1401.16 --> 1404.279
[Music]

1405.64 --> 1412.5200000000002
so I guess more in the direction of

1409.93 --> 1417.53
Mediterranean and I do have in the past

1412.52 --> 1419.72
I've had some more Asian meals more in

1417.53 --> 1422.12
that direction also because my dad used

1419.72 --> 1425.21
to make that great and just yeah sticks

1422.12 --> 1428.78
with you but without meat much of those

1425.21 --> 1432.29
types of meals are just they don't

1428.78 --> 1435.02
really work so I never really made them

1432.29 --> 1437.06
anymore since I became vegetarian but

1435.02 --> 1441.77
I'm not gonna replace it with its like

1437.06 --> 1444.53
meat replace ya know did don't want to

1441.77 --> 1445.79
do that just replace it with vegetables

1444.53 --> 1448.21
but if it doesn't work then it doesn't

1445.79 --> 1448.21
work

1450.51 --> 1463.09
and then of course I do make like chunky

1455.53 --> 1465.7
soup just huge bowl of soup with boo

1463.09 --> 1477.85
Yong in it and then just pile on

1465.7 --> 1484.38
potatoes cauliflower celery is it dipped

1477.85 --> 1484.3799999999999
a bit ah I don't remember what is it

1485.88 --> 1490.39
it's a very different word from Dutch I

1488.41 --> 1492.3400000000001
don't remember but I put all that stuff

1490.39 --> 1495.72
in there so it's really chunky

1492.34 --> 1496.99
oh yeah and of course she decade

1495.72 --> 1500.74
mushrooms

1496.99 --> 1501.97
I rarely it's like one of the first

1500.74 --> 1503.6200000000001
thing I really started to apply

1501.97 --> 1508.71
mushrooms in because I don't like

1503.62 --> 1514.3899999999999
mushrooms so you always never like them

1508.71 --> 1516.94
but they're very healthy so I've kind of

1514.39 --> 1520.41
tried to force that in there and this is

1516.94 --> 1522.429
great when I eat that especially during

1520.41 --> 1527.8600000000001
the spring time

1522.429 --> 1529.66
great stuff it's all fresh so that yeah

1527.86 --> 1533.4099999999999
that's pretty much it as for the

1529.66 --> 1534.91
old-fashioned Dutch meals and all while

1533.41 --> 1536.8000000000002
the Dutch viewers that I have know

1534.91 --> 1540.64
exactly what I mean is typically just

1536.8 --> 1544.99
potato some kind of vegetables so yeah

1540.64 --> 1545.679
and then a piece of meat there with with

1544.99 --> 1549.04
gravy

1545.679 --> 1555.49
that's like classic Dutch stuff but yeah

1549.04 --> 1558.55
eating that vegetarian I that makes very

1555.49 --> 1562.03
little sense to me all right till we

1558.55 --> 1566.01
improve the cost on pot yeah that that's

1562.03 --> 1571.0
also very Dutch well you know what it's

1566.01 --> 1572.68
it's like a specific type of cabbage

1571.0 --> 1577.18
leaf

1572.68 --> 1579.3700000000001
and you mix it in with stomped potatoes

1577.18 --> 1581.1100000000001
and maybe little milk and butter in

1579.37 --> 1584.7299999999998
there so that's you that's usually how I

1581.11 --> 1588.25
used to do it and becomes like this yeah

1584.73 --> 1590.58
stockpot it's just mashed stuff Dutch

1588.25 --> 1595.48
seem to like that a lot

1590.58 --> 1598.6299999999999
and but if you don't get some good gravy

1595.48 --> 1600.85
in there that is kind of meat based and

1598.63 --> 1603.19
especially if you don't get the sausage

1600.85 --> 1607.51
because there you're supposed to have at

1603.19 --> 1611.74
least a piece of a sausage in there and

1607.51 --> 1614.32
without that it's just like yeah so I

1611.74 --> 1615.82
yeah to be fair I've even looked at that

1614.32 --> 1619.3899999999999
at the store is like oh it's it's

1615.82 --> 1622.24
Bullock ol time ah wait that's with the

1619.39 --> 1624.9
sausage you know what maybe that's what

1622.24 --> 1624.9
I'm gonna be eating

1625.38 --> 1634.24
maybe that hmm I kind of like that

1630.25 --> 1636.66
actually yeah maybe that's what I'm

1634.24 --> 1639.76
gonna try out yeah

1636.66 --> 1651.69
with this cold weather that type of meal

1639.76 --> 1651.69
is just great deep fried bananas what

1658.57 --> 1664.09
okay but more colored maybe like when

1662.05 --> 1667.09
it's really warm in the summer that

1664.09 --> 1672.36
could be interesting I guess I don't

1667.09 --> 1674.98
know or wait a minute

1672.36 --> 1680.05
deep-fried banana does that lie in the

1674.98 --> 1682.03
corner of typical the New Year's Eve

1680.05 --> 1687.19
type of treats we got a lot of those as

1682.03 --> 1689.74
well it's basically you take stuff it's

1687.19 --> 1692.29
either just a big ball of dough with

1689.74 --> 1695.23
raisins in it it's a special type and

1692.29 --> 1699.27
you fry them and they're called only

1695.23 --> 1702.22
Boleyn oil balls yeah

1699.27 --> 1704.53
it's typically New Year's Eve treat over

1702.22 --> 1707.3500000000001
here I don't know how well that is in

1704.53 --> 1709.75
other countries but and then there's you

1707.35 --> 1711.55
do you take a slice of apple and then

1709.75 --> 1713.14
it's covered in though and you deep-fry

1711.55 --> 1715.62
that Apple fluffer

1713.14 --> 1720.7
yeah oil balls really it's called that

1715.62 --> 1723.9299999999998
that's translated into English so maybe

1720.7 --> 1729.8500000000001
it falls into that kind of category I

1723.93 --> 1734.19
guess that could work with a banana yeah

1729.85 --> 1734.1899999999998
sorry for making everyone so hungry now

1745.17 --> 1750.49
Oh

1747.04 --> 1752.5
yeah and the Eco Plaza like during the

1750.49 --> 1756.43
New Year's you'd like the last week they

1752.5 --> 1760.03
also tend to have like those type of

1756.43 --> 1762.73
things but organically made and they're

1760.03 --> 1767.74
kind of expensive but it's just so great

1762.73 --> 1770.35
to have that at least once a year but

1767.74 --> 1774.27
they're not out yet it's still all

1770.35 --> 1776.53
sinter Klass chocolate stuff and also

1774.27 --> 1779.91
transitioning that probably pretty soon

1776.53 --> 1779.91
into Christmas of the same

1788.63 --> 1792.94
- Hedgehog crisps what

1799.77 --> 1804.3899999999999
well YouTube I think if you're gonna do

1802.08 --> 1807.299
that you're gonna yeah go bust with that

1804.39 --> 1811.429
business pretty soon I don't think that

1807.299 --> 1811.429
people like burnt plastic flavor

1831.299 --> 1834.049
hmm

1836.99 --> 1841.25
and I think makes a lot of noise

1864.85 --> 1868.3799999999999
what kind of question is that

1870.59 --> 1877.899
since when have carbon and hydrogen been

1874.49 --> 1877.8990000000001
very good nutrients

1897.23 --> 1904.8990000000001
Oh God Elvis midnight snack that's just

1901.94 --> 1907.3400000000001
I don't know he used to be quite

1904.899 --> 1911.059
extravagant with his he was like a

1907.34 --> 1913.399
Gorger it was like somebody to stuff

1911.059 --> 1915.82
himself he had a period like that so I

1913.399 --> 1915.82
heard

1939.92 --> 1947.53
yeah George sent for drugs and and

1943.66 --> 1950.98
gorging himself on food definitely and

1947.53 --> 1950.98
candy and [ __ ]

1953.08 --> 1957.75
you remember that Elvis got pretty fat

1955.42 --> 1961.93
at the end right

1957.75 --> 1965.85
well not like super obese I think but he

1961.93 --> 1965.8500000000001
did definitely get a little bit chubby

1975.89 --> 1981.3600000000001
[Music]

1977.19 --> 1987.8990000000001
Delphis burgers i think it is

1981.36 --> 1991.7389999999998
salary is nasty really why or if you

1987.899 --> 1995.9399999999998
yeah celery raw it's pretty invasive

1991.739 --> 1999.72
taste I think but if you just like cook

1995.94 --> 2002.47
it like with soup and everything it's

1999.72 --> 2006.769
great I love it

2002.47 --> 2013.429
but raw celery is a bit bit harsh I'd

2006.769 --> 2016.46
agree although it it seems to be very

2013.429 --> 2018.8890000000001
healthy though I used to slow juice with

2016.46 --> 2021.409
celery and if you combine it with some

2018.889 --> 2024.0089999999998
other stuff it's it's not it's not

2021.409 --> 2024.009
terrible

2026.59 --> 2033.3999999999999
like there's worse thing things then

2029.2 --> 2036.07
celery for me or is it there's this one

2033.4 --> 2038.23
kind of root and I just don't like the

2036.07 --> 2041.1599999999999
taste of it but it seems to be epically

2038.23 --> 2041.16
healthy apparently

2055.92 --> 2058.64
great

2060.27 --> 2067.99
[Music]

2063.05 --> 2067.9900000000002
right okay no English

2071.45 --> 2075.46
oh yeah it's called fennel

2079.27 --> 2084.73
that stuff seems to be incredibly

2081.19 --> 2088.389
healthy but I just that and that tastes

2084.73 --> 2091.869
it like doesn't matter if you cook it it

2088.389 --> 2098.17
never goes away it's like this weird

2091.869 --> 2101.2200000000003
deceptive anise type does it taste but

2098.17 --> 2104.2000000000003
different and never goes away

2101.22 --> 2106.72
but it's so healthy apparently so every

2104.2 --> 2109.8689999999997
time it's usually some woman my mother

2106.72 --> 2112.0299999999997
or someone otherwise cooking mother

2109.869 --> 2116.53
they'll be like yeah you're gonna eat

2112.03 --> 2122.94
this it's healthy you know yeah okay

2116.53 --> 2125.32
it's healthy I'm just gonna eat it yeah

2122.94 --> 2129.42
you got to do something for your health

2125.32 --> 2129.42
sometimes even though it's not nice

2131.84 --> 2135.09
[Music]

2136.93 --> 2142.18
yeah my dad also seems to like it a lot

2139.96 --> 2144.25
everybody that I know that eats really

2142.18 --> 2148.18
healthy seems to like that a lot

2144.25 --> 2151.289
how disappointing what I'll probably get

2148.18 --> 2151.2889999999998
over it as I get older

2166.64 --> 2169.77
[Music]

2183.1 --> 2186.239
[Music]

2220.569 --> 2224.4
that's just silly more color

2229.78 --> 2234.13
all right yeah Robin Stanley I like

2231.85 --> 2238.99
licorice too and it really depends on

2234.13 --> 2241.56
the type I'm Dutch so I have this very

2238.99 --> 2245.31
freaky habit and yeah this is like

2241.56 --> 2253.57
internationally weird about Dutch people

2245.31 --> 2256.0
but I like salt licorice yeah and it can

2253.57 --> 2258.67
get even worse than that I kind of like

2256.0 --> 2261.58
which is almost like a pure salt power

2258.67 --> 2266.08
powder some typical Dutch candy have

2261.58 --> 2268.96
them in it and yeah that freaks some

2266.08 --> 2271.7799999999997
people out I once took like a bag of

2268.96 --> 2274.57
this type of candy with me to to Spain

2271.78 --> 2276.2200000000003
and I would be just chunking it down

2274.57 --> 2277.9
because I love that [ __ ]

2276.22 --> 2280.5699999999997
even though it's not too healthy and

2277.9 --> 2282.94
then I gave one to my friend and he was

2280.57 --> 2285.28
like oh that's kind of sweet like mints

2282.94 --> 2291.19
on the outside yeah it is any children

2285.28 --> 2297.94
is like yeah like yeah that's Dutch

2291.19 --> 2300.88
candy yeah hilarious on the other hand

2297.94 --> 2306.39
you know it can get worse I heard that

2300.88 --> 2309.3900000000003
in Iceland they like to suck on fish

2306.39 --> 2309.39
lollipops

2310.11 --> 2316.33
I can't imagine something more

2312.85 --> 2317.17
discussing that no offence and fish is

2316.33 --> 2321.64
very healthy

2317.17 --> 2324.73
Icelanders it's just I don't even like

2321.64 --> 2328.23
eating fish really so I do take fish oil

2324.73 --> 2328.23
because I know it's healthy but

2344.8 --> 2351.1600000000003
yeah also weird thing is that they seem

2347.56 --> 2356.7999999999997
to have taken a lot of the really salt

2351.16 --> 2358.96
powdery licorice that's like really

2356.8 --> 2362.4700000000003
classically Dutch they've taken a lot of

2358.96 --> 2365.4700000000003
them just out of the general stores out

2362.47 --> 2368.1899999999996
of the candy sections like they're not

2365.47 --> 2371.5299999999997
in there any I can rarely find them now

2368.19 --> 2373.75
because apparently health problems yeah

2371.53 --> 2376.1800000000003
hey if you start chugging like down

2373.75 --> 2378.64
these rolls of our most pure salt yeah

2376.18 --> 2381.0699999999997
no [ __ ] it's not healthy you know if

2378.64 --> 2384.46
somebody's stupid enough to do that man

2381.07 --> 2386.29
I remember it back in the old days my

2384.46 --> 2389.4700000000003
teens that sometimes I would eat like

2386.29 --> 2391.42
half a roll of that [ __ ] in an hour just

2389.47 --> 2394.8999999999996
start chewing on it like a maniac and

2391.42 --> 2401.4900000000002
then after that's like oh [ __ ] that's

2394.9 --> 2404.4700000000003
not good I got salt poisoning yeah so

2401.49 --> 2407.0699999999997
definitely don't chuck that down it's

2404.47 --> 2407.0699999999997
not healthy

2410.97 --> 2416.8799999999997
well I don't know sometimes I just

2413.94 --> 2425.7200000000003
really feel like I want to get something

2416.88 --> 2429.869
insanely salt was it almost like a

2425.72 --> 2431.8799999999997
licking stone like salty licking stone

2429.869 --> 2434.069
was that is that for like bunnies I

2431.88 --> 2436.4100000000003
think they have like these salt licking

2434.069 --> 2437.819
stones and it's they need that sometimes

2436.41 --> 2440.1299999999997
they just need that and they start

2437.819 --> 2443.099
licking on the salt they only do it when

2440.13 --> 2445.29
they need it and it's yeah it almost

2443.099 --> 2454.76
feels like that sometimes like oh I need

2445.29 --> 2457.7599999999998
salt right now but not a lot

2454.76 --> 2457.76
horses

2458.77 --> 2462.079
[Music]

2477.1 --> 2482.87
what are we talking about food today

2479.84 --> 2486.02
Sherlock Holmes come on do we always

2482.87 --> 2488.9
have to do the same [ __ ] over and over

2486.02 --> 2491.15
again or can we just share this moment

2488.9 --> 2493.82
where we realize that we're all humans

2491.15 --> 2495.77
and that we all need to eat and it's if

2493.82 --> 2499.9700000000003
you eat better it's actually healthier

2495.77 --> 2504.08
for you and can get more grip on your

2499.97 --> 2506.7799999999997
mind maybe you know never bad to talk

2504.08 --> 2508.79
about healthy eating and food in general

2506.78 --> 2513.32
it's very interesting also to a lot of

2508.79 --> 2515.81
people so food binds groups together and

2513.32 --> 2518.03
we don't always just have to monotonous

2515.81 --> 2520.22
lis on this show at least you know it

2518.03 --> 2521.6000000000004
flat like flat earth debates it's the

2520.22 --> 2523.8199999999997
Flat Earth debates and he's going to be

2521.6 --> 2527.24
doing that oh yeah every freaking day

2523.82 --> 2531.29
you can expect that kind of stuff

2527.24 --> 2533.8999999999996
happening but hey we don't always just I

2531.29 --> 2535.97
don't want to spend an hour every day

2533.9 --> 2539.0
just getting agitated over the stupidity

2535.97 --> 2541.1
of ballers and their constant repetition

2539.0 --> 2542.6
of the same question over and over and

2541.1 --> 2545.39
over again that I've elaborately

2542.6 --> 2548.66
answered every single time and I'm just

2545.39 --> 2554.35
getting sick of that you know sometimes

2548.66 --> 2554.35
people just not want to do that

2570.349 --> 2578.1800000000003
all right Robin Stanley glad you agree

2574.329 --> 2580.099
because we all need to eat and I think

2578.18 --> 2581.5989999999997
that probably a lot of people are not

2580.099 --> 2583.4
necessarily the ones that show

2581.599 --> 2586.279
themselves in my chat a lot but a lot of

2583.4 --> 2589.309
people that do follow this stuff still

2586.279 --> 2594.319
are clinging on to like bad childhood

2589.309 --> 2596.6600000000003
food habits and they underestimated but

2594.319 --> 2599.479
yes they grow older they will start to

2596.66 --> 2600.949
notice and then compare it to other

2599.479 --> 2602.749
people what they've done and they'll

2600.949 --> 2605.66
start to figure out like oh wait maybe I

2602.749 --> 2607.759
will need to catch up that's also

2605.66 --> 2609.199
another thing that I've noticed I've

2607.759 --> 2610.999
paid attention because I've been eating

2609.199 --> 2614.329
organic for like ten years

2610.999 --> 2617.779
please for me very persistently and I

2614.329 --> 2622.299
just noticed that the certain types of

2617.779 --> 2626.799
people that come in organic supermarkets

2622.299 --> 2634.549
and I just noticed that it's a lot of

2626.799 --> 2636.949
especially it's a lot of ladies a lot of

2634.549 --> 2640.339
mothers it's just excellent I love it

2636.949 --> 2642.92
every time a freaking mom with a

2640.339 --> 2645.949
carriage or whatever comes in even if

2642.92 --> 2649.4
the kid is it's like really noisy or

2645.949 --> 2652.219
whatever I'm just happy because means at

2649.4 --> 2654.7090000000003
least that kids gonna get some real food

2652.219 --> 2656.869
you know that mother takes it serious

2654.709 --> 2660.1989999999996
for you that's good but before

2656.869 --> 2663.349
especially last ten years notice that a

2660.199 --> 2667.88
lot of older ladies also come there and

2663.349 --> 2670.279
it really looks like yeah they're like

2667.88 --> 2672.079
yeah I just glanced at what's going

2670.279 --> 2673.819
around you know I pick up stuff just

2672.079 --> 2675.349
from looking at people and it just seems

2673.819 --> 2678.65
like a lot of them are like hmm you

2675.349 --> 2681.949
really need to fix this there's

2678.65 --> 2684.38
something yeah like they're really

2681.949 --> 2686.089
starting to learn about food probably

2684.38 --> 2688.609
because of necessity and other things

2686.089 --> 2695.029
didn't work that kind of thing I noticed

2688.609 --> 2696.89
that and there's other than that I just

2695.029 --> 2698.9
noticed a lot of people that are

2696.89 --> 2701.87
typically going in the direction of

2698.9 --> 2704.42
vegans a lot of vegans also

2701.87 --> 2706.7599999999998
and with that some kind of soy boyish

2704.42 --> 2712.2400000000002
types but not like the really gobbling

2706.76 --> 2716.9
ones thank God not where I am at least

2712.24 --> 2718.8199999999997
and yeah that seems to be the typical

2716.9 --> 2724.9100000000003
people that that come there and it's

2718.82 --> 2727.1600000000003
yeah it's good and it's also lovely that

2724.91 --> 2729.6499999999996
sometimes you do notice that some people

2727.16 --> 2731.72
are really new to it and they're like

2729.65 --> 2734.06
really uncertain they're like standing

2731.72 --> 2737.7799999999997
in front of the organics or like should

2734.06 --> 2740.81
we do this you know and then they try it

2737.78 --> 2742.4
out and they're like really almost like

2740.81 --> 2744.14
they feel like they're walking inside of

2742.4 --> 2747.77
a theater like oh this is all different

2744.14 --> 2751.0099999999998
and hmm it just feels different

2747.77 --> 2754.0099999999998
hmm sometimes see that too it's very

2751.01 --> 2757.3100000000004
amusing and I always think like okay

2754.01 --> 2760.48
well I didn't know how they respond to

2757.31 --> 2765.08
how I look because yeah black coat no

2760.48 --> 2767.72
but I am always open to inform people

2765.08 --> 2769.52
I've done that a lot in the past just be

2767.72 --> 2771.1099999999997
like somebody's looking for something

2769.52 --> 2775.16
and then nope just if they notice they

2771.11 --> 2777.6800000000003
can't find it Oh Inquirer and and some

2775.16 --> 2780.08
talk about food or nutrition will unfold

2777.68 --> 2784.48
I've had this many times in last 10

2780.08 --> 2784.48
years great conversations

2793.75 --> 2796.9
[Music]

2812.82 --> 2818.69
[Music]

2815.69 --> 2818.69
yeah

2828.82 --> 2838.36
this that's ridiculous though but I'll

2835.87 --> 2841.12
bet something global fantasies will

2838.36 --> 2844.83
probably try to suggest something as

2841.12 --> 2844.83
silly as that at some point to a kid

2849.16 --> 2855.1
now food talk I'm starving now yeah

2851.68 --> 2856.8399999999997
sorry me too actually I'm gonna probably

2855.1 --> 2859.35
get some lunch in ten minutes really

2856.84 --> 2859.3500000000004
quickly

2875.609 --> 2880.16
all right well don't dusty Flint gravels

2879.39 --> 2882.8689999999997
porn

2880.16 --> 2886.14
you're probably referencing the whole

2882.869 --> 2888.719
foods shopping thing well that's not

2886.14 --> 2892.109
that doesn't exist over here in in

2888.719 --> 2894.359
Europe that's American exclusive and

2892.109 --> 2897.569
yeah there's huge issues with them and

2894.359 --> 2899.0989999999997
even them sneaking GMO and [ __ ] in the

2897.569 --> 2904.5589999999997
past I don't know if they still do that

2899.099 --> 2906.869
but all kinds of stuff but these organic

2904.559 --> 2908.63
stores over here the Eco Plaza is not

2906.869 --> 2913.88
like that at all

2908.63 --> 2920.009
not as far as I could have seen the only

2913.88 --> 2924.299
they are like very eco and also there is

2920.009 --> 2925.95
also some kind of sympathy towards the

2924.299 --> 2929.459
idea of climate change but they don't

2925.95 --> 2931.739
seem to be forwarding that 100% they do

2929.459 --> 2933.69
is if you could I meet new truck let me

2931.739 --> 2935.88
do it's not like on the billboards of

2933.69 --> 2938.099
themselves and they seem to be more

2935.88 --> 2943.44
really focusing on sensible things like

2938.099 --> 2948.2090000000003
okay getting organic farms stable in the

2943.44 --> 2952.589
country and that kind of thing and is it

2948.209 --> 2955.0789999999997
they're very like against using plastics

2952.589 --> 2957.8289999999997
and they really work on it with the

2955.079 --> 2960.299
actual systems they use like more glass

2957.829 --> 2961.739
utilization and they've been working on

2960.299 --> 2964.229
that for a long time and so have a lot

2961.739 --> 2966.93
of other organic stores yes I'm now

2964.229 --> 2970.019
going to this door specifically it's a

2966.93 --> 2971.819
kind of big brand but there are others

2970.019 --> 2975.39
out there as well although this one has

2971.819 --> 2977.549
kind of been trying to dominate the

2975.39 --> 2980.279
market a bit and they I think they did

2977.549 --> 2984.5389999999998
it very efficiently and without just

2980.279 --> 2989.849
becoming outright evil you know they

2984.539 --> 2991.7090000000003
didn't turn as far as I have seen and I

2989.849 --> 2994.38
would take it I would object I take

2991.709 --> 2996.66
objection to that I would I'm typically

2994.38 --> 3001.9990000000003
a guided IFIF I see something it just

2996.66 --> 3004.069
really aggravates me I will tell where I

3001.999 --> 3006.2099999999996
would least tell my part of the story

3004.069 --> 3009.24
about it

3006.21 --> 3011.549
I want I won't be like associate just

3009.24 --> 3013.95
really have to take this down now I'm

3011.549 --> 3017.45
not gonna not gonna create a ruckus

3013.95 --> 3026.819
that's and useless especially where it's

3017.45 --> 3029.4199999999996
where I go shopping that's in America

3026.819 --> 3029.42
maybe

3038.8 --> 3043.8100000000004
and also just because they technically

3041.62 --> 3046.08
fit doesn't mean that it's a durable

3043.81 --> 3049.54
situation

3046.08 --> 3053.47
there's also literally territorial

3049.54 --> 3055.42
effects like the more compacted people

3053.47 --> 3061.12
are towards when it works the same with

3055.42 --> 3064.06
every at any group animal like the mice

3061.12 --> 3066.91
for example or just if if there's not

3064.06 --> 3068.5
enough room like even though technically

3066.91 --> 3072.46
they would fit if there's not enough

3068.5 --> 3077.26
space between constantly then it starts

3072.46 --> 3079.33
to agitate and that so that's part of

3077.26 --> 3082.2400000000002
the problem with cities in general and

3079.33 --> 3086.04
some people actually thrive on that

3082.24 --> 3090.2799999999997
I guess they love to be on that level

3086.04 --> 3095.02
but yeah if you just stuff everyone into

3090.28 --> 3098.2900000000004
just in America yeah it's gonna get a

3095.02 --> 3103.09
lot worse if you do that so yeah there's

3098.29 --> 3107.41
a lot of space but people do also need

3103.09 --> 3109.0
to have spaces available to them where

3107.41 --> 3111.45
they're not getting crowded by other

3109.0 --> 3111.45
people

3121.95 --> 3126.48
Makia life morning

3154.72 --> 3160.56
yes barrel music he's hanging around

3157.18 --> 3160.56
almost every day so

3177.5 --> 3187.849
yeah the noise is there jackhammering

3181.46 --> 3194.51
giant steel you call them it's not

3187.849 --> 3199.5800000000004
pillars you know the shape the the

3194.51 --> 3202.4900000000002
h-shape cross-section bulk box is in a

3199.58 --> 3205.7
bulk right there right ramming a giant

3202.49 --> 3211.1189999999997
steel bulk into the mud ground with it

3205.7 --> 3213.5899999999997
with a is that a a digging machine

3211.119 --> 3214.31
transformed with the jackhammer on top

3213.59 --> 3218.3
so dirty

3214.31 --> 3221.09
yeah it's the noisiest [ __ ] pile driving

3218.3 --> 3224.09
yeah that's pretty much it but they're

3221.09 --> 3226.9100000000003
not like cocoon kachunk which is another

3224.09 --> 3231.53
thing now they're literally because it's

3226.91 --> 3235.8199999999997
a lot of mud beneath there so then it's

3231.53 --> 3238.69
like a a giant wasp trying to drill a

3235.82 --> 3244.869
hole in the stone except this one is a

3238.69 --> 3244.869
hundred times bigger and noisier

3254.52 --> 3262.07
a beam okay not a bulk a beam is that

3259.56 --> 3262.07
called a beam

3289.89 --> 3301.67
Buffalo what they're still Buffalo out

3293.4 --> 3301.67
there really I thought they were extinct

3314.09 --> 3316.8700000000003
hmm

3332.269 --> 3340.339
huh Wow that's that's I had no idea Jura

3338.689 --> 3344.509
Sandra I really thought they were all

3340.339 --> 3347.149
extinct but maybe it's just that they

3344.509 --> 3351.319
don't dominate the plains and the

3347.149 --> 3354.019
savannas anymore that's right I had no

3351.319 --> 3358.159
idea there they were farmed I guess why

3354.019 --> 3359.959
not buffalo ranch is still okay well you

3358.159 --> 3363.549
learn something every day I guess

3359.959 --> 3363.549
they're still around

3364.359 --> 3369.009
yeah not wild I imagine

3373.309 --> 3380.01
although I wonder you know technically

3376.53 --> 3384.3900000000003
you could maybe like semi wild form them

3380.01 --> 3389.55
if you could if you can find a special

3384.39 --> 3391.65
location like that would be like a

3389.55 --> 3395.4
natural pen where they would be

3391.65 --> 3398.67
surrounded by rock faces everywhere like

3395.4 --> 3402.51
a well it would live to be huge like an

3398.67 --> 3405.03
area where they couldn't just migrate

3402.51 --> 3410.28
hundreds of miles away and they'd be

3405.03 --> 3412.23
stuck in a in a natural pen then you

3410.28 --> 3414.3
could have semi-wild yeah you'd have to

3412.23 --> 3422.46
hunt them every time if you wanted to

3414.3 --> 3425.6600000000003
get one they'd probably do it by

3422.46 --> 3425.66
helicopter or something

3452.1 --> 3456.74
leaner meat hmm okay

3460.3 --> 3467.05
is there any organic fed buffaloes or is

3464.65 --> 3468.58
that just the default don't know what

3467.05 --> 3470.71
they get to eat or they just go with the

3468.58 --> 3474.85
Grande lands what grasslands what's the

3470.71 --> 3478.63
quality because if there's any organic I

3474.85 --> 3483.54
I maybe if I ever get to the US I might

3478.63 --> 3483.54
want to try that just as a curiosity

3488.7 --> 3497.6499999999996
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

3491.26 --> 3498.94
show good food is a good foundation I

3497.65 --> 3501.37
thought it was a good title for this

3498.94 --> 3504.31
show it's almost exclusively talking

3501.37 --> 3507.1
about that and I'm gonna get some lunch

3504.31 --> 3510.07
right after this but I'm also going to

3507.1 --> 3512.95
join the Flat Earth debates after I've

3510.07 --> 3513.5800000000004
done lunching so thanks everyone for

3512.95 --> 3515.23
coming
