2.49 --> 9.61
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.189 --> 13.929
early-bird number 43 I'm your host

9.61 --> 19.65
Arwen and like yesterday to get today

13.929 --> 25.179000000000002
again is a gray day but not too cold

19.65 --> 28.75
decent let's see it was a chat a daniel

25.179 --> 37.718999999999994
field here mr. Riggs

28.75 --> 42.480000000000004
j-mac AGM well guys you typically seem

37.719 --> 42.480000000000004
to be the first people entering my chair

49.11 --> 53.019999999999996
yep

50.32 --> 60.01
by the way where are you you guys from

53.02 --> 61.809000000000005
you three American or British if they

60.01 --> 65.609
are American then you're either really

61.809 --> 65.609
early people are really late

72.39 --> 78.93
I've been watching my performances from

75.3 --> 82.75999999999999
yesterday including the one on the after

78.93 --> 82.76
show that was right before this show and

82.91 --> 91.37
it's very annoyed by myself and I also

88.23 --> 98.79
took the opportunity to analyze

91.37 --> 102.57000000000001
carefully what was going on and yeah I'm

98.79 --> 107.34
noticing that I have a lot of trouble

102.57 --> 109.979
connecting yesterday and in retrospect

107.34 --> 114.36
that's not too strange because the day

109.979 --> 116.55
before I in an impulse decided like yeah

114.36 --> 119.729
I want beer right now

116.55 --> 122.6
was Wednesday like after my paper round

119.729 --> 129.41
and I got it

122.6 --> 132.76999999999998
and yeah I guess it was kind of nice but

129.41 --> 136.02
like as soon as I started drinking it I

132.77 --> 140.91000000000003
just I haven't drank in a while like

136.02 --> 144.18
maybe a month now and it just hit me the

140.91 --> 147.57
wrong way physically I was very odd and

144.18 --> 155.34
that didn't really go away and like the

147.57 --> 159.09
next morning I took clear results from

155.34 --> 165.93
that in the sense that my intestines

159.09 --> 169.739
were clearly not performing as usual it

165.93 --> 175.14000000000001
happens sometimes but yeah I was pretty

169.739 --> 179.4
hard and to get into details but yeah I

175.14 --> 181.98
was burdened by that all day it was like

179.4 --> 186.09
having been hit in the head with a

181.98 --> 189.81
hammer and not that I'd be dizzy or like

186.09 --> 192.239
oh I can't focus no but I just didn't

189.81 --> 198.57
have the full range of my normal

192.239 --> 203.52
capacities and even when you're in such

198.57 --> 204.97
a state it's hard to actually see where

203.52 --> 209.46
you lack

204.97 --> 212.41
so you're just it feels like you're just

209.46 --> 214.3
feeling around in the dark almost like

212.41 --> 218.5
hey things are not as normal what's

214.3 --> 224.44
different and yeah it resulted in me

218.5 --> 226.78
basically almost misinterpreting the

224.44 --> 228.97
entire thought line of what others were

226.78 --> 231.37
talking about and starting off and

228.97 --> 234.55
completely completely separate separate

231.37 --> 237.79
lines of thought resulting in situations

234.55 --> 240.49
where I was even left like okay how does

237.79 --> 244.29999999999998
this really apply to what was talked

240.49 --> 249.60000000000002
about it's very annoying distracting and

244.3 --> 253.15
that was not my purpose so I hope yeah

249.6 --> 256.15
yeah this evening I will also be

253.15 --> 258.67
drinking some beer but with the gamers

256.15 --> 265.87
usually never have a bad result because

258.67 --> 272.11
of that the next day but it was good to

265.87 --> 275.8
see that also makes me more careful

272.11 --> 277.84000000000003
considering alcohol now maybe they also

275.8 --> 280.57
I've been also thinking that maybe just

277.84 --> 284.40999999999997
has to do with my diet because most of

280.57 --> 290.29
the summer I've been using their fish

284.41 --> 294.25
oil supplements or krill oil and that

290.29 --> 297.07
helps a lot and yeah I ran out of those

294.25 --> 300.12
and I can't pay for new supplements in

297.07 --> 303.90999999999997
this regard at least yeah just can't

300.12 --> 305.919
scrape it together in my budget still

303.91 --> 312.19
kind of struggling trying to stabilize

305.919 --> 315.28
things so that may be the reason because

312.19 --> 318.18
I didn't have the proper nutrients to

315.28 --> 324.15999999999997
basically recover from the alcohol

318.18 --> 328.36
it left long-term effects that will of

324.16 --> 330.43
course over time cover but usually when

328.36 --> 332.89
I take the supplements I don't have any

330.43 --> 336.40000000000003
of these type of effects the next day

332.89 --> 338.34999999999997
may be a short moment and then grow out

336.4 --> 338.79999999999995
of it pretty quickly but now that did

338.35 --> 348.43
really

338.8 --> 352.84000000000003
didn't really happen yesterday I'm gonna

348.43 --> 357.849
have a busy time coming week with the

352.84 --> 360.84
show which does really take quite a

357.849 --> 366.069
substantial amount of energy but energy

360.84 --> 369.38899999999995
well worth spent we're also gonna be

366.069 --> 372.97
working on the show and I have to do

369.389 --> 377.919
some things for my let's just say my

372.97 --> 379.78000000000003
dad's company which I am apart I can't

377.919 --> 384.849
talk too much about it in public it is

379.78 --> 387.69
legal all of it but yeah some things

384.849 --> 397.889
that have to be done in that department

387.69 --> 401.759
and also having yeah bank issues overall

397.889 --> 408.18
because suddenly my bank has decided to

401.759 --> 412.83000000000004
stop allowing internet payment

408.18 --> 415.33
confirmation system using text messages

412.83 --> 417.159
like it's still functional but they say

415.33 --> 419.38
they're gonna cut it down and I'm so

417.159 --> 421.3
disappointed at that cuz they're yeah

419.38 --> 424.479
they're now giving me the option of

421.3 --> 427.96000000000004
getting this clumsy device that I have

424.479 --> 429.58
to have separately and I guess I'll go

427.96 --> 432.37
with that because the other only option

429.58 --> 438.12
is to like yeah but we have a very easy

432.37 --> 442.569
app to download on your iPhone or

438.12 --> 445.509
Samsung or black oh great thanks so

442.569 --> 447.88
you're gonna railroad me onto having a

445.509 --> 452.08000000000004
standard mobile phone and all that [ __ ]

447.88 --> 452.65
which I've been trying to avoid for over

452.08 --> 458.10999999999996
a decade

452.65 --> 462.94
thanks yeah I'm actually really pissed

458.11 --> 464.68
off about that I wonder if I could do

462.94 --> 466.3
something against it because it doesn't

464.68 --> 468.88
really make any sense that they're

466.3 --> 472.029
shutting this down it works it works

468.88 --> 472.83
fine never had complaints about it

472.029 --> 476.21999999999997
myself

472.83 --> 480.44899999999996
and it should be really cheap it's low

476.22 --> 482.43
that low data so there's not gonna be a

480.449 --> 484.77000000000004
lot of costs to this it's gonna be

482.43 --> 487.229
always going to be dirt cheap to them so

484.77 --> 490.58
there's just no reason to cut it out of

487.229 --> 500.81
the options and it just pisses me off

490.58 --> 505.53
that's typical corporatism just yeah

500.81 --> 509.19
it's anti-free market taking away

505.53 --> 511.55999999999995
options for no good reasons even if it

509.19 --> 513.87
is an option that's not widely popular

511.56 --> 517.68
you must have these options there are

513.87 --> 525.66
some people that depend on this you know

517.68 --> 527.4899999999999
like me yeah I know peanuts Clark they

525.66 --> 529.26
do want to collect my dad and of course

527.49 --> 531.589
they already are through my own computer

529.26 --> 537.68
and through the network of things

531.589 --> 537.6800000000001
through my telephone conversations but

537.95 --> 544.32
yeah I'm not to look at this point and

542.49 --> 550.5
for over at least five years I've

544.32 --> 554.7
already consolidated that yeah there is

550.5 --> 557.01
really no privacy not really just there

554.7 --> 560.279
should be but there isn't and there's

557.01 --> 565.1
really nothing to be done about this on

560.279 --> 573.92
the short run but my problem comes with

565.1 --> 577.8000000000001
with the modern phone devices is it's

573.92 --> 580.829
the interface of the screen I don't like

577.8 --> 583.949
touch screens I don't like the small

580.829 --> 586.7399999999999
super-high fine pixel resolution and it

583.949 --> 588.5699999999999
is proven to be bad for the eyes I don't

586.74 --> 590.73
like the options I don't like the

588.57 --> 592.9100000000001
possibilities it is an entire computer

590.73 --> 595.41
on that thing and I don't want them I

592.91 --> 598.14
don't want to get addicted to that I

595.41 --> 601.17
don't want to get stuck into a phone

598.14 --> 606.22
because I had similar problems with Game

601.17 --> 610.6899999999999
Boys in the 90s and it's not good for me

606.22 --> 614.97
it it removes me from social

610.69 --> 618.2800000000001
communication like the person I'd like

614.97 --> 619.75
Stewart striven for a long time too

618.28 --> 625.5699999999999
basically when I walk on the street

619.75 --> 629.1
always look up always look at people try

625.57 --> 632.6500000000001
to look them in the eye and socialize

629.1 --> 638.11
just on a very superficial basis because

632.65 --> 640.09
that has become a rarity now people used

638.11 --> 643.69
to do that always especially in the

640.09 --> 646.51
Midlands people were socially alert you

643.69 --> 648.3100000000001
can see now half of the people and

646.51 --> 651.01
especially the youngsters almost all of

648.31 --> 654.42
them take just walk around looking in

651.01 --> 658.66
their fricking mobiles and horrifying

654.42 --> 661.9599999999999
and you can even see how some of these

658.66 --> 665.13
people because of their trends and

661.96 --> 669.4000000000001
staring the stream potentially walk into

665.13 --> 672.76
extreme danger just being reckless

669.4 --> 675.6999999999999
because of their hypnotic state and it's

672.76 --> 678.01
a miracle not more more accidents don't

675.7 --> 681.85
happen but I guess that people like

678.01 --> 684.0699999999999
behind the wheel or on bikes just know

681.85 --> 686.26
about this new phenomena of people

684.07 --> 689.71
stumbling around being reckless

686.26 --> 693.7
almost like drunken cats walking all

689.71 --> 695.73
over the place because it's there right

693.7 --> 698.73
now and people have to be more careful

695.73 --> 698.73
but

702.66 --> 707.509
it's such a spirits of spiritual tragedy

708.019 --> 715.11
because these people really are missing

711.36 --> 719.48
out and they're escaping from socially

715.11 --> 724.3100000000001
interacting phone confrontation with

719.48 --> 727.62
elements that they don't personally want

724.31 --> 732.6899999999999
but that they need to be used to in

727.62 --> 735.029
order to be able to adapt and be part of

732.69 --> 737.0400000000001
the world and if you don't expose

735.029 --> 739.079
yourself to these elements if you keep

737.04 --> 742.86
stuck completely to your own safe space

739.079 --> 747.0889999999999
socially then you become incompatible

742.86 --> 748.74
and you become antisocial by accident

747.089 --> 755.3000000000001
not necessarily through nasty behavior

748.74 --> 758.04
but just being unable to to make sense

755.3 --> 761.31
of the world and the world will not be

758.04 --> 764.0999999999999
able to make sense view event and people

761.31 --> 770.189
may probably start to regard you as like

764.1 --> 773.1890000000001
a snowflake or something or somebody

770.189 --> 775.29
that just always is in their mobile or

773.189 --> 778.41
be under computer that I don't know

775.29 --> 781.05
probably the common people that deal

778.41 --> 782.939
with this a lot more because they deal

781.05 --> 785.4799999999999
more with regi the people that do that

782.939 --> 789.68
have their own words for it their own

785.48 --> 795.5600000000001
references that I've never even heard of

789.68 --> 798.8389999999999
live relatively socially isolated but

795.56 --> 803.75
yeah the world has changed and I don't

798.839 --> 808.3800000000001
want to risk getting the same effect and

803.75 --> 814.589
then there is also the mobile phone

808.38 --> 816.0
radiation factor even with a basic phone

814.589 --> 818.37
like I have that doesn't even have

816.0 --> 823.67
internet capabilities which is shut off

818.37 --> 823.67
deliberately it

824.85 --> 830.1890000000001
yeah I can have it around I keep it away

827.459 --> 836.2489999999999
from me pretty much in the outer outer

830.189 --> 838.439
corner like at least feet away for like

836.249 --> 842.609
at least one meter away from my feet and

838.439 --> 844.799
two meters away from my head roughly so

842.609 --> 846.419
that's doable for me it comes to the end

844.799 --> 849.0889999999999
it doesn't have a lot of that data

846.419 --> 852.779
stream output just the basic thing I

849.089 --> 857.1890000000001
guess it's not too aggressive but yeah

852.779 --> 860.069
if you're gonna use a higher capability

857.189 --> 861.779
phone with internet streaming and [ __ ]

860.069 --> 865.1089999999999
yeah there could be all kinds of things

861.779 --> 867.929
just initiating or out of doing things

865.109 --> 870.9590000000001
without telling you if you have that

867.929 --> 872.6089999999999
capability for so many stories of this

870.959 --> 874.8589999999999
happening to people with their mobiles

872.609 --> 877.859
and they just disregarded cuz they're

874.859 --> 881.729
streaming constantly anyway and so

877.859 --> 885.9590000000001
exposed to all that radiation I just I

881.729 --> 891.089
can't do it I can't handle it I feel

885.959 --> 895.169
that [ __ ] and luckily I have built up

891.089 --> 899.249
some tolerance but it is it requires a

895.169 --> 904.109
lot of discipline because it forces a

899.249 --> 907.35
slice out of my sensory attention when I

904.109 --> 912.0490000000001
for example try to see and I have to

907.35 --> 915.4490000000001
constantly try to avoid that without

912.049 --> 917.639
fracturing myself it's very difficult

915.449 --> 921.8689999999999
sometimes especially when I feel a

917.639 --> 924.899
little weaker but yeah I never really

921.869 --> 927.8290000000001
feel like I am seriously damaged by this

924.899 --> 930.539
like anything that has happened when I

927.829 --> 932.8789999999999
I've been a lot more instead well like

930.539 --> 935.549
period right after my girlfriend broke

932.879 --> 938.249
up with me that kind of thing yeah then

935.549 --> 941.6089999999999
then I'm completely broken and that kind

938.249 --> 945.989
of [ __ ] really tends to break me up or

941.609 --> 950.009
shatter me or to confuse jumbo me in my

945.989 --> 952.8290000000001
character it's really weird but yeah

950.009 --> 954.509
safe to say then that I recovered from

952.829 --> 957.199
all that and it feels so much more

954.509 --> 957.1990000000001
stable

957.56 --> 961.5999999999999
so that's not gonna happen anytime soon

967.0 --> 970.0
Cheers

972.25 --> 978.55
but yeah another thing though that was

975.23 --> 981.5
kind of funny or interested good yes

978.55 --> 988.9399999999999
though yeah it's so about the angle but

981.5 --> 992.15
apparently the Council of Europe is

988.94 --> 995.4100000000001
warning now currently about the health

992.15 --> 1000.0699999999999
dangers of Wi-Fi and mobile phones

995.41 --> 1004.42
apparently though the government of the

1000.07 --> 1009.0100000000001
Netherlands is not responding to it but

1004.42 --> 1011.62
I am astounded that yeah that the

1009.01 --> 1013.9
European Council apparently would even

1011.62 --> 1017.23
be admitting this and just publishing

1013.9 --> 1021.34
about that that's kind of a good thing

1017.23 --> 1024.25
and yeah Europe is overall not very good

1021.34 --> 1028.689
at doing good things but that is good

1024.25 --> 1031.6
and surprising so yeah

1028.689 --> 1033.6100000000001
this it's real like there's some people

1031.6 --> 1036.76
out there that just say no you know

1033.61 --> 1039.1599999999999
Wi-Fi and mobile it's not proven I don't

1036.76 --> 1042.069
care it's too many advantages blah blah

1039.16 --> 1045.28
blah and yeah there are some people that

1042.069 --> 1048.25
at least psychologically are completely

1045.28 --> 1051.85
unaffected it it just doesn't hit their

1048.25 --> 1054.19
frequency somehow they can't feel

1051.85 --> 1057.61
anything of it they might get a little

1054.19 --> 1063.21
dizzy if they're like absolutely bathing

1057.61 --> 1066.6599999999999
in y5 like say like 10 mobiles within

1063.21 --> 1070.33
within 1 meter distance all are all

1066.66 --> 1072.8400000000001
maximum downloading [ __ ] you know that

1070.33 --> 1075.34
kind of thing yeah anyone will feel that

1072.84 --> 1077.5
but on average they don't have any

1075.34 --> 1079.48
complaints and yeah they will find out

1077.5 --> 1082.72
eventually because on the long run I

1079.48 --> 1087.34
believe that it also has detrimental

1082.72 --> 1090.67
effect and I am personally suspecting it

1087.34 --> 1096.49
is in the direction of

1090.67 --> 1099.67
for a breast aging gradual but it's slow

1096.49 --> 1102.79
so you don't really see it and just see

1099.67 --> 1105.5500000000002
it afterwards like wow I think it might

1102.79 --> 1109.12
be something like that but at this point

1105.55 --> 1112.3899999999999
that is just a wild guess no direct fish

1109.12 --> 1118.51
in confirmation even of that just got

1112.39 --> 1121.3000000000002
this feeling about it yeah and I don't

1118.51 --> 1124.96
want to be part of it I don't want it

1121.3 --> 1128.1699999999998
mobile on the other hand I do kind of

1124.96 --> 1131.68
want a mobile because yeah it is

1128.17 --> 1132.43
convenient especially for travel yeah

1131.68 --> 1138.46
I'm not gonna

1132.43 --> 1140.65
unless I get a laptop but yeah still not

1138.46 --> 1144.46
the most convenient thing to haul around

1140.65 --> 1150.88
when traveling backpack could do I guess

1144.46 --> 1158.32
and that's good to have a phone at least

1150.88 --> 1160.42
need some kind of communication so yeah

1158.32 --> 1162.82
and a mobile is very good for filming

1160.42 --> 1166.78
and yeah so kinds of pervs I could

1162.82 --> 1170.61
potentially do an early-bird show on the

1166.78 --> 1174.61
move with such a thing

1170.61 --> 1176.8899999999999
so yeah the temptation is great for

1174.61 --> 1179.7099999999998
pragmatic reasons but I am still

1176.89 --> 1184.8700000000001
figuring out in my head okay if I will

1179.71 --> 1187.9
actually go and do that what's gonna be

1184.87 --> 1192.1599999999999
the effect in the short run and on the

1187.9 --> 1197.2
long run and what can I do to minimize

1192.16 --> 1203.77
the foreseen dangers and the negative

1197.2 --> 1206.8
side effects and I need to balance this

1203.77 --> 1212.37
out carefully before I proceed to

1206.8 --> 1212.37
actually make a decision it's gonna take

1213.12 --> 1221.1999999999998
this point so Wow can't believe I just

1218.47 --> 1235.299
spent over 20 minutes talking about this

1221.2 --> 1238.63
ah that is very cool yeah I do know

1235.299 --> 1245.049
about things like ePaper flexible

1238.63 --> 1249.22
plastic with digital light print it does

1245.049 --> 1251.23
it has existed for a long time at least

1249.22 --> 1253.929
since 2010 or something maybe even

1251.23 --> 1257.58
earlier but yeah it has been around but

1253.929 --> 1262.0900000000001
it has advantages and disadvantages

1257.58 --> 1264.6999999999998
because it's obvious you'll find out

1262.09 --> 1268.529
once you try it out but yeah I've been

1264.7 --> 1271.769
wanting it like an e paper kind of thing

1268.529 --> 1278.889
for D&D because that would be extremely

1271.769 --> 1280.929
convenient or like a an iPad kind of

1278.889 --> 1283.75
thing but you know especially at this

1280.929 --> 1287.76
point definitely not don't want to have

1283.75 --> 1287.76
anything to do with Apple at this point

1287.789 --> 1295.36
yeah not for a long time to come but any

1293.049 --> 1299.23
paper kind of thing it would be very

1295.36 --> 1302.289
cool to have it's still not going to

1299.23 --> 1304.84
functionally replace an actual desktop

1302.289 --> 1308.01
computer though so it's mostly for

1304.84 --> 1312.07
reading stuff that's gonna be very handy

1308.01 --> 1316.32
PDFs that kind of thing but maybe web

1312.07 --> 1316.32
pages that's it

1336.68 --> 1339.749
[Music]

1352.36 --> 1364.99
the earlybird show on the moon no house

1361.299 --> 1374.11
Larry's I need to get an astronaut

1364.99 --> 1376.769
costume for that you know I can't read

1374.11 --> 1376.769
the thin atmosphere

1407.38 --> 1411.0400000000002
no hm

1419.69 --> 1426.45
that's not what I doubt the tree is

1423.649 --> 1429.1689999999999
maybe a little vanity or something but

1426.45 --> 1429.169
that's about it

1433.82 --> 1440.6689999999999
wait I see they would read and chat

1436.529 --> 1446.57
Roger MC we're in this together forever

1440.669 --> 1449.8990000000001
twit with Sabrina browning Jeffrey bill

1446.57 --> 1449.899
[ __ ] you

1464.659 --> 1485.029
yeah all right okay yeah this point this

1480.21 --> 1487.049
weekend I'm gonna try to figure out OBS

1485.029 --> 1490.62
once and for all

1487.049 --> 1495.059
he's doing startup in in the most in the

1490.62 --> 1497.1899999999998
basic set up and see what to build with

1495.059 --> 1503.58
it when I can build with it without a

1497.19 --> 1506.0700000000002
meeting looking forward to it yeah show

1503.58 --> 1515.34
could be looking a lot very different as

1506.07 --> 1518.85
it is from what it does no it's funny

1515.34 --> 1521.639
you should say that again because like

1518.85 --> 1527.9599999999998
in my team's I really wanted to be that

1521.639 --> 1527.9599999999998
I really thought yeah I can do that but

1528.08 --> 1535.649
yeah what's very naive still about what

1532.83 --> 1539.1899999999998
Hollywood was about and about that ultra

1535.649 --> 1547.139
liberalism and the creepy things I had

1539.19 --> 1554.1290000000001
no idea back then so maybe for the best

1547.139 --> 1557.1
that me didn't go fooling on that but

1554.129 --> 1559.1
yeah and it is still like it I guess a

1557.1 --> 1561.6
childhood dream or something

1559.1 --> 1563.9399999999998
but it would have to be good look I am a

1561.6 --> 1568.9499999999998
freaking perfectionist when it comes to

1563.94 --> 1571.2
arts I'm glad to report that I find my

1568.95 --> 1575.909
own my own goldsmithing skills

1571.2 --> 1578.7
sufficient to my own liking but when it

1575.909 --> 1583.6390000000001
comes for example to music related

1578.7 --> 1587.94
things of my own creation no no I'm very

1583.639 --> 1591.57
Cheverus because I'm the perfectionist

1587.94 --> 1594.48
and I could never perform an instrument

1591.57 --> 1597.809
to my own liking

1594.48 --> 1600.3600000000001
Ginty maybe singing one day but still

1597.809 --> 1603.33
very my voice isn't the best singing

1600.36 --> 1606.87
voice although I do know how to I've

1603.33 --> 1608.4499999999998
pretty wide range and I do know how to

1606.87 --> 1614.6689999999999
keep talking but my voice is just

1608.45 --> 1618.809
scratch it's not very bass and not very

1614.669 --> 1621.45
pure and scratched me afraid my voice is

1618.809 --> 1633.75
just not the best that could be for the

1621.45 --> 1638.94
singer but now I lost track right

1633.75 --> 1639.45
oh yeah right but yeah acting that'll be

1638.94 --> 1644.13
cool

1639.45 --> 1646.669
I did some stage acting comes at school

1644.13 --> 1649.65
most typical thing they did at school

1646.669 --> 1653.97
lower grade school and I always took it

1649.65 --> 1656.5800000000002
extremely serious and did my best for it

1653.97 --> 1659.46
so I have this impulse to really act

1656.58 --> 1661.9189999999999
form and even overdo it if that is

1659.46 --> 1664.919
required which is typically required in

1661.919 --> 1666.6000000000001
actual stage acting because people are

1664.919 --> 1674.429
looking at you at a distance so you got

1666.6 --> 1676.4699999999998
to grab their attention yeah but yeah I

1674.429 --> 1680.3400000000001
don't want to be a movie star

1676.47 --> 1684.049
I don't wanted to have a bunch of drums

1680.34 --> 1684.049
screaming at me you

1689.32 --> 1694.029
but I guess it would be cool to have a

1691.539 --> 1699.669
role in it like a cool fantasy movie or

1694.029 --> 1702.94
something as a side role or maybe an

1699.669 --> 1706.48
actual role maybe some like director

1702.94 --> 1709.24
just sees me and things like yeah you

1706.48 --> 1713.74
would be perfect for this as long as

1709.24 --> 1716.139
it's not like an insane kooky conspiracy

1713.74 --> 1719.47
theory kind of role because then screw

1716.139 --> 1722.74
you I won't hit not be put in that kind

1719.47 --> 1724.1490000000001
of stereotype bastard I know there are

1722.74 --> 1727.35
some people that would probably love to

1724.149 --> 1730.75
do that it's not gonna happen

1727.35 --> 1733.4499999999998
unless it was like a full-on comedy

1730.75 --> 1742.57
movie that's another case then I could

1733.45 --> 1746.919
work with that but no I'm not like gonna

1742.57 --> 1753.46
hurry and take a cheap and cheap short

1746.919 --> 1756.6290000000001
trip into that sector not a hurry I'll

1753.46 --> 1756.6290000000001
just see what happens

1771.58 --> 1777.73
yeah a villain role would also be kind

1774.129 --> 1782.34
of cool as long as the villain is

1777.73 --> 1782.34
actually allowed to have a character

1782.879 --> 1790.9889999999998
like I don't want to beat you in me very

1788.32 --> 1793.119
unless yeah it is kind of a funny

1790.989 --> 1797.499
selling movie then I guess I could act

1793.119 --> 1803.7099999999998
like that because it's supposed to be

1797.499 --> 1805.809
kind of funny but now if it's gonna be

1803.71 --> 1807.929
more serious movie if I'm gonna play a

1805.809 --> 1811.809
villain then it'll have to be like

1807.929 --> 1816.489
conflicted feeling and not necessarily

1811.809 --> 1819.21
even brooding but there has to be a damn

1816.489 --> 1819.21
good reason

1823.17 --> 1831.89
and hey I can suggest even yeah

1828.049 --> 1833.91
structure for such a character I

1831.89 --> 1835.14
experiment with that kind of thing in

1833.91 --> 1837.72
D&D all the time

1835.14 --> 1843.21
oh yeah there's opponents and there's

1837.72 --> 1845.72
evil puns and why why are they evil what

1843.21 --> 1851.4
makes them evil um

1845.72 --> 1854.6100000000001
what keeps it the way it is yeah so

1851.4 --> 1858.0900000000001
interesting character study to me and I

1854.61 --> 1866.3899999999999
could probably act some of it out as if

1858.09 --> 1877.35
I were the real thing anyway

1866.39 --> 1882.5400000000002
teenage dreams being an actor I'm just

1877.35 --> 1888.049
doing this talking to people online loud

1882.54 --> 1888.049
and it's fine

1898.18 --> 1906.88
hmm yeah yeah I like sizing up people's

1903.49 --> 1910.78
insights and knowledge as well because

1906.88 --> 1914.23
everything they say is a reflection it

1910.78 --> 1917.1399999999999
is like a sieve like an in giant

1914.23 --> 1920.35
spectrum of color and content and

1917.14 --> 1923.38
meaning and who has a certain wave

1920.35 --> 1926.8899999999999
pattern of information every time you

1923.38 --> 1931.21
say something you basically outline a

1926.89 --> 1936.01
certain structure on that pattern called

1931.21 --> 1939.19
the akashic we've the Akashic library so

1936.01 --> 1942.31
everything that is said on anyone will

1939.19 --> 1944.98
reflect somewhat of the knowledge that

1942.31 --> 1950.58
they touch upon and I look at it like

1944.98 --> 1954.3700000000001
that so everything that is said can be

1950.58 --> 1958.48
extrapolated into a sizing up a

1954.37 --> 1960.85
knowledge base over time and also ways

1958.48 --> 1964.15
of thinking also impulses that write

1960.85 --> 1967.27
them will also gather up and eventually

1964.15 --> 1970.3000000000002
even show cyclical patterns and all that

1967.27 --> 1973.95
and that's how you really get to know

1970.3 --> 1973.95
and understand the person

1998.78 --> 2007.09
it's interesting and not too sure what

2001.48 --> 2009.19
you're talking about ATM God twit

2007.09 --> 2022.36
weights how do you come up with that

2009.19 --> 2024.73
stuff those pop stars anyway yeah it was

2022.36 --> 2031.539
a part of what I wanted in my teen ages

2024.73 --> 2033.64
I wanted to be an astronaut that's

2031.539 --> 2035.85
literally one of the first things I said

2033.64 --> 2038.5900000000001
when somebody asked me what you wanna be

2035.85 --> 2045.6399999999999
really yeah

2038.59 --> 2051.45
and then that my created to wanting to

2045.64 --> 2055.51
be either an architect or an actor and

2051.45 --> 2059.29
then as my teens passed and I didn't

2055.51 --> 2061.8990000000003
find much kripp in school for the

2059.29 --> 2067.02
architect part and much grip in the

2061.899 --> 2070.5989999999997
actor section section yeah in that world

2067.02 --> 2076.659
through connections I basically gave up

2070.599 --> 2079.839
and started wondering like what am I

2076.659 --> 2082.119
gonna do with this and so I decided to

2079.839 --> 2084.73
just engage on a path of knowledge like

2082.119 --> 2088.0
okay until further notice until I can

2084.73 --> 2093.389
find like any profession I'm gonna do

2088.0 --> 2093.389
that and then at some

2099.24 --> 2109.39
2004 yeah was basically railroaded into

2106.39 --> 2111.8799999999997
picking something and it is a you know

2109.39 --> 2115.75
what I'll just do goldsmithing because

2111.88 --> 2118.27
yeah then I can make jewels which I can

2115.75 --> 2121.42
wear in the Gothic seem that I had

2118.27 --> 2124.9
entered pretty freshly Souls like very

2121.42 --> 2127.119
much into fashion and I focused a lot on

2124.9 --> 2129.07
jewelry and I thought like yeah do that

2127.119 --> 2132.69
hang around these people maybe sell some

2129.07 --> 2138.42
stuff that that was kind of my plan and

2132.69 --> 2142.42
so I became a goldsmith and that became

2138.42 --> 2145.63
like a real profession thing problem

2142.42 --> 2148.63
with it was though that Goldsmith on its

2145.63 --> 2153.1600000000003
own is not really a full profession it's

2148.63 --> 2156.13
a craft but to survive that's not enough

2153.16 --> 2163.45
you have to also be a Salesman and a

2156.13 --> 2166.51
retailer and basically a jewelry fashion

2163.45 --> 2169.72
designer if you want to make some real

2166.51 --> 2172.119
living out of it and if you don't then

2169.72 --> 2175.39
it's a hobby because there's a lot of

2172.119 --> 2182.05
competition a lot of really good artists

2175.39 --> 2187.0
out there skill wise and they all thrive

2182.05 --> 2188.5
on connections and family because a lot

2187.0 --> 2190.8
of people have Goldsmith's

2188.5 --> 2196.03
in them I'm the goldsmith in my family

2190.8 --> 2199.21
and I think even one of my cousin's has

2196.03 --> 2205.8100000000004
a wife that is also a goldsmith so yeah

2199.21 --> 2208.41
they're everywhere but yeah then the

2205.81 --> 2208.41
gothic scene

2211.55 --> 2219.8100000000004
weird [ __ ] happen to me a lot of

2215.94 --> 2222.7200000000003
terrible [ __ ] happen to me yes one of

2219.81 --> 2225.24
the things that I'm absolutely certain

2222.72 --> 2227.22
did physically happen that could be

2225.24 --> 2230.58
considered a terrible thing is that at

2227.22 --> 2233.8799999999997
one point somebody actually poisoned me

2230.58 --> 2238.35
against my knowing with ayahuasca in a

2233.88 --> 2243.7200000000003
drink which had terrible terrible side

2238.35 --> 2247.47
effects vision inducing but completely

2243.72 --> 2251.1
unguided in a nasty place with people

2247.47 --> 2254.52
that were blatantly evil and I was kind

2251.1 --> 2256.92
of arrogant and naive naively trusting

2254.52 --> 2262.109
these people I should have just not been

2256.92 --> 2264.48
there this so yeah I did learn my lesson

2262.109 --> 2266.31
in a very brutal way and I never I will

2264.48 --> 2269.66
never go back to that place where that

2266.31 --> 2269.66
have a never ever

2275.14 --> 2282.7
but all of that basically drove me away

2279.42 --> 2286.44
from the wider gothic seaman especially

2282.7 --> 2290.049
I guess the metal and the industrial

2286.44 --> 2294.609
cultural part of the things where a lot

2290.049 --> 2296.799
of these people that just crazy also

2294.609 --> 2300.16
hang around it's not all of them it's

2296.799 --> 2303.339
just a few people but I don't know I ran

2300.16 --> 2306.0989999999997
into them maybe I was looking for

2303.339 --> 2309.5789999999997
trouble I don't know what the hell I was

2306.099 --> 2312.219
doing I was completely being guided by

2309.579 --> 2317.289
these weird delusional gothic principles

2312.219 --> 2329.619
and seeing it as an art but not really

2317.289 --> 2331.2090000000003
realizing how deluded it was and also

2329.619 --> 2333.88
that there are people out there that

2331.209 --> 2337.8689999999997
actually literally took that as real

2333.88 --> 2340.9590000000003
principles that's just thinking about it

2337.869 --> 2343.809
in retrospect this is terrifying but I

2340.959 --> 2348.64
didn't believe that these people would

2343.809 --> 2355.9
really do that we really believe such

2348.64 --> 2358.5989999999997
dark things this but yeah it seems a

2355.9 --> 2361.9300000000003
weird place it's a great variety and

2358.599 --> 2365.049
look there's some really awesome gothic

2361.93 --> 2371.2889999999998
people out there still today everyone is

2365.049 --> 2375.009
their own character and yes I was just

2371.289 --> 2381.69
in the wrong crowd a long time but I'm

2375.009 --> 2385.029
out of it and I'm not like completely

2381.69 --> 2387.4
cutting the gothic scene out of my life

2385.029 --> 2390.219
entirely I might still join a party if

2387.4 --> 2393.309
it's under the right conditions and I

2390.219 --> 2400.2690000000002
know there's people that I really do

2393.309 --> 2405.0690000000004
trust my real good friends and when I'm

2400.269 --> 2407.019
just much more cautious now and just

2405.069 --> 2408.0589999999997
like yeah there's some really nice and

2407.019 --> 2412.14
even kind of in

2408.059 --> 2414.329
some people and yeah just around that

2412.14 --> 2417.779
and just pay attention

2414.329 --> 2419.819
no something weird happens or creepy

2417.779 --> 2424.64
people enter that I recognize just get

2419.819 --> 2424.64
the hell out of there no no problem

2424.91 --> 2433.0789999999997
but yeah a goldsmith that's basically

2430.109 --> 2436.41
the profession that I became but it I

2433.079 --> 2440.369
never really let go of the knowledge

2436.41 --> 2443.3689999999997
path because despite it not helping me

2440.369 --> 2446.849
in a direct sense connecting to society

2443.369 --> 2450.63
and making me more prosperous it gave me

2446.849 --> 2452.9100000000003
so many things for the things that I

2450.63 --> 2454.739
made on my symbolic sudden L side the

2452.91 --> 2457.6499999999996
things that I wrote down it was like oh

2454.739 --> 2460.799
where's this why is this coming from

2457.65 --> 2465.049
just not something I read and then oh

2460.799 --> 2468.959
like I'm gonna recreate that no just I

2465.049 --> 2472.17
have read things but I never consciously

2468.959 --> 2474.749
tried to fabricate these things they

2472.17 --> 2477.63
just entered me and I wrote them down as

2474.749 --> 2481.89
well as I could trying to study what it

2477.63 --> 2486.2690000000002
was and yeah to this day it's still

2481.89 --> 2489.5989999999997
sitting there and I'm still yeah it's

2486.269 --> 2493.9199999999996
just remarkable I came out of it and

2489.599 --> 2496.619
where I ended up going that path for

2493.92 --> 2503.099
such a long time the insights that I've

2496.619 --> 2506.329
been and the abilities the options for

2503.099 --> 2509.9590000000003
abilities that come with that knowledge

2506.329 --> 2513.719
the more you see the more you can

2509.959 --> 2517.14
approach and can potentially fix correct

2513.719 --> 2518.88
in a holistic way because yeah you can

2517.14 --> 2522.42
see something that bothers you and just

2518.88 --> 2525.299
try to attack the symptom like I'm doing

2522.42 --> 2527.2490000000003
this I don't like that stop it don't do

2525.299 --> 2531.15
it or you could just figure out

2527.249 --> 2535.189
holistically like with why where is that

2531.15 --> 2537.619
impulse coming from what is this cycle

2535.189 --> 2541.7889999999998
what's feeling this

2537.619 --> 2544.099
what are the instinctive purely

2541.789 --> 2550.309
animalistic foundations causing it and

2544.099 --> 2553.5190000000002
what is the mental cycle not adapting it

2550.309 --> 2556.0690000000004
to it and allowing you to move beyond it

2553.519 --> 2558.529
how does that work and then figure that

2556.069 --> 2560.869
out and once you really figure that and

2558.529 --> 2563.749
that takes some very serious effort and

2560.869 --> 2566.509
inside you really need that insight you

2563.749 --> 2567.319
need to be clear enough to get that when

2566.509 --> 2571.63
you get that

2567.319 --> 2575.96
then suddenly fixing yourself becomes

2571.63 --> 2579.859
like an operation not a surgical

2575.96 --> 2582.44
operation but just like okay this is

2579.859 --> 2587.65
what I have to do this is what I have to

2582.44 --> 2591.289
pay attention to specifically and you

2587.65 --> 2594.38
just know yeah this is probably gonna

2591.289 --> 2601.0690000000004
change because that and it has with a

2594.38 --> 2605.779
lot of things for me so yeah my quest

2601.069 --> 2609.98
for knowledge and insight has yielded

2605.779 --> 2614.089
some amazing results for me to help me

2609.98 --> 2616.819
improve myself with and I'm yeah I will

2614.089 --> 2619.73
never really give it up not really no

2616.819 --> 2625.009
it's part of me it's part of the way I

2619.73 --> 2628.64
am it's part of my busying therapy

2625.009 --> 2631.46
because I have a very active mind and

2628.64 --> 2633.739
it's very hard to keep it still so I

2631.46 --> 2641.569
have so much digging it can always stay

2633.739 --> 2644.359
busy always I'll never get really

2641.569 --> 2645.829
anxious because like I have to do

2644.359 --> 2647.359
something but I don't know what to do

2645.829 --> 2649.67
now there's always something to think

2647.359 --> 2657.609
always something to ponder on the

2649.67 --> 2657.609
something to think out design thank God

2658.829 --> 2665.5
but yeah I I guess that I am also

2662.589 --> 2669.04
attempting at the same time to develop

2665.5 --> 2672.609
more communication public type of skills

2669.04 --> 2676.54
and I've even considered earlier that I

2672.609 --> 2680.92
may end up in politics although you it's

2676.54 --> 2682.81
not very nice idea considering the type

2680.92 --> 2686.77
of politicians that I would be dealing

2682.81 --> 2691.96
with on a daily basis I'm just that

2686.77 --> 2694.089
culture doing this I don't know if

2691.96 --> 2696.07
anything if I'd go there I'd do it to

2694.089 --> 2702.869
break that culture just completely

2696.07 --> 2706.42
shatter it and just become direct and

2702.869 --> 2712.089
bring in honor and responsibility again

2706.42 --> 2714.579
and just brutal honesty that kind of

2712.089 --> 2716.41
thing but we'll see it's gonna be awhile

2714.579 --> 2717.6400000000003
and at the mean

2716.41 --> 2723.0
in the meantime yeah I don't know I

2717.64 --> 2723.0
guess I like what I'm doing now uh a

2724.079 --> 2735.4900000000002
talk-show host a blogger maybe this is

2731.44 --> 2738.76
to some people this is just called being

2735.49 --> 2742.27
a blogger but yeah it develops my

2738.76 --> 2745.42
communication skills and my performance

2742.27 --> 2747.609
skills it it's it has taken away a lot

2745.42 --> 2751.51
of performance anxiety which was very

2747.609 --> 2754.0299999999997
strong with me very very strong and it's

2751.51 --> 2757.78
still there but just I mean all this

2754.03 --> 2759.67
practice knowing what to expect in all

2757.78 --> 2765.3900000000003
directions like anything that could

2759.67 --> 2768.01
happen as in energy-wise energy

2765.39 --> 2770.44
realignments like after this nervous

2768.01 --> 2772.9
have settled I know pretty much anything

2770.44 --> 2780.88
what to expect by now because I've done

2772.9 --> 2785.5
so many of these daily shows so yeah it

2780.88 --> 2787.3900000000003
has helped me to overcome my yeah

2785.5 --> 2790.119
performance excited and very glad of

2787.39 --> 2791.81
that because so much more comfortable

2790.119 --> 2794.69
now can actually like

2791.81 --> 2798.08
a there's a group here of people there

2794.69 --> 2801.44
just talking and they seem like they

2798.08 --> 2804.83
want more and I could just step in and

2801.44 --> 2807.7400000000002
just suddenly start public speaking to

2804.83 --> 2810.92
them like actually addressing a bigger

2807.74 --> 2813.1699999999996
group with a concept similar to this

2810.92 --> 2816.05
because this is basically the only thing

2813.17 --> 2819.7000000000003
is I'm not literally facing the faces of

2816.05 --> 2819.7000000000003
all the people that are listening to me

2820.12 --> 2828.3199999999997
but I would now be able to do that on a

2823.63 --> 2831.1400000000003
moment's notice by choice if I deem it

2828.32 --> 2835.3700000000003
to be the right moment to do it without

2831.14 --> 2838.2999999999997
choking myself from oh my god how you

2835.37 --> 2842.27
will accept me all the typical jitter

2838.3 --> 2844.67
nerves things because I know used to it

2842.27 --> 2848.9
and I'm very happy about it gives me new

2844.67 --> 2854.21
options new opportunities and I need

2848.9 --> 2859.12
those yeah I've been stuck in a pretty

2854.21 --> 2863.7200000000003
isolated place relatively in my life

2859.12 --> 2868.5499999999997
compared to most people and I do feel

2863.72 --> 2871.87
like yeah you know what I don't need the

2868.55 --> 2875.1800000000003
exact opposite but I kind of want to

2871.87 --> 2877.16
climb up I want to get closer I want to

2875.18 --> 2878.6299999999997
have more interaction I'm ready for it I

2877.16 --> 2884.12
have more skills I have more confidence

2878.63 --> 2886.82
to do it and I kind of do want to do I

2884.12 --> 2892.6099999999997
always have wanted to be very

2886.82 --> 2897.02
communicative in the inside just very

2892.61 --> 2899.4500000000003
nervous and especially when I was really

2897.02 --> 2901.82
young and preteens I just didn't know

2899.45 --> 2904.7599999999998
how to freaking communicate I didn't get

2901.82 --> 2907.6600000000003
these people I didn't get what motivated

2904.76 --> 2914.42
what drove them so it was just like I

2907.66 --> 2917.48
like this like this or just no I don't

2914.42 --> 2919.34
think you would ever like accept me so

2917.48 --> 2921.86
I'm just gonna avoid you that's usually

2919.34 --> 2924.4100000000003
what I did with most people like barely

2921.86 --> 2926.15
communicated with anybody else and then

2924.41 --> 2932.0
my parents

2926.15 --> 2932.0
yeah yeah look how far I've come

2934.87 --> 2944.08
I'd be proud of it if I didn't know that

2941.24 --> 2947.66
doing these things would simply

2944.08 --> 2950.39
inevitably inevitably yield this result

2947.66 --> 2953.06
but then again I did make that choice

2950.39 --> 2957.1099999999997
and I guess that I'm proud of making

2953.06 --> 2960.62
that choice for myself so not so much

2957.11 --> 2963.08
the results but that I did make that

2960.62 --> 2969.2
choice that I did allow that to manifest

2963.08 --> 2972.68
that I didn't pull myself short very

2969.2 --> 2977.6
happy about it and very curious to see

2972.68 --> 2983.0299999999997
where this will bring me and where what

2977.6 --> 2989.48
other skill frontiers new angles social

2983.03 --> 2991.5800000000004
wise knowledge wise sense wise what else

2989.48 --> 2995.51
is gonna be out there for me to develop

2991.58 --> 2998.72
it because I there still room I feel it

2995.51 --> 3001.2400000000002
I can feel it in my bones

2998.72 --> 3006.66
I can feel there's more room there's

3001.24 --> 3018.7
more skill to be discovered and explored

3006.66 --> 3023.5299999999997
I talk about myself way too much on the

3018.7 --> 3029.73
other hand people like Anthony writing

3023.53 --> 3034.6600000000003
he talks about the ballers a lot so I

3029.73 --> 3037.87
guess some people just have more

3034.66 --> 3044.7999999999997
tenacious focus on specific group or on

3037.87 --> 3047.56
themselves and yeah for me it is really

3044.8 --> 3050.8
out of necessity and the need for self

3047.56 --> 3053.2
improvement because focusing on myself

3050.8 --> 3055.1200000000003
and dealing with the details and trying

3053.2 --> 3058.14
to verbalize them explain them and

3055.12 --> 3063.46
thereby understanding them myself better

3058.14 --> 3065.97
have I allowed have I enabled to grow as

3063.46 --> 3065.9700000000003
I have

3067.05 --> 3072.2200000000003
and trust me especially when I was

3069.91 --> 3081.99
younger my teams I was a lot more

3072.22 --> 3085.6
obnoxious much louder more arrogant more

3081.99 --> 3087.7299999999996
enough arrogant but just absolutely

3085.6 --> 3092.49
convinced that I was totally an

3087.73 --> 3097.06
invincible invincible and you could I

3092.49 --> 3101.08
really have like ideas like I can like

3097.06 --> 3106.48
break out to be like some kind of God or

3101.08 --> 3111.04
something like yes I was I guess drunk

3106.48 --> 3116.29
on the dormant potential energy that I

3111.04 --> 3124.27
was made aware of my parents really

3116.29 --> 3126.58
bring me up with promises like they did

3124.27 --> 3129.28
test my talents and insights when I was

3126.58 --> 3132.49
very young and they tell me like yeah

3129.28 --> 3135.4900000000002
that's your special like an intelligence

3132.49 --> 3137.1699999999996
kind of way and skill and but you could

3135.49 --> 3143.6299999999997
become you could be anything you imagine

3137.17 --> 3146.4900000000002
I wanna be strong yay it's the first one

3143.63 --> 3150.96
[Music]

3146.49 --> 3150.9599999999996
yeah except that but

3152.05 --> 3157.6000000000004
they had despite all these these

3154.66 --> 3159.8799999999997
promises didn't reflect themselves in

3157.6 --> 3161.2599999999998
society and didn't reflect themselves on

3159.88 --> 3162.9100000000003
other people and then hear my parents

3161.26 --> 3166.1200000000003
yourself told me that they're just

3162.91 --> 3173.5899999999997
jealous I just don't get it

3166.12 --> 3178.5699999999997
and that was just such a brutal brutal

3173.59 --> 3184.81
blow to me I was so disappointed because

3178.57 --> 3187.3
I couldn't adapt

3184.81 --> 3190.15
I couldn't lower myself it felt wrong it

3187.3 --> 3192.4
felt damaging and the people would not

3190.15 --> 3194.35
respect me for it even if I tried and I

3192.4 --> 3198.55
did try at times when I was really young

3194.35 --> 3201.79
preteen adapted a lot of it do anything

3198.55 --> 3207.84
just to be part of their group part of

3201.79 --> 3212.07
the guys and it's just a brutal

3207.84 --> 3217.4100000000003
disappointment that I wasn't accepted

3212.07 --> 3217.4100000000003
for my talents except by my own parents

3217.74 --> 3226.0
and some adults would recognize it they

3221.41 --> 3228.25
also saw the very apparent problems and

3226.0 --> 3231.82
character problems that came with these

3228.25 --> 3234.01
talents which they always do so they

3231.82 --> 3237.1000000000004
were very careful about it and just left

3234.01 --> 3241.48
it to my parents my parents didn't help

3237.1 --> 3242.79
me a lot they did at least put me on the

3241.48 --> 3247.84
rails

3242.79 --> 3250.18
of this mission to construct myself into

3247.84 --> 3252.4300000000003
something better I started with them

3250.18 --> 3255.19
this talking this self-improvement

3252.43 --> 3258.0299999999997
it was encouraged by my parents like

3255.19 --> 3260.53
starting when I was five years old

3258.03 --> 3267.1600000000003
roughly when I first started to really

3260.53 --> 3270.52
talk seriously like jumbling still young

3267.16 --> 3273.8799999999997
but I was trying to put out complex

3270.52 --> 3278.11
thinking it worked really pretty well

3273.88 --> 3280.9900000000002
for the time and they started to teach

3278.11 --> 3282.46
me like yeah you have to analyze if you

3280.99 --> 3285.39
have problems you have to analyze

3282.46 --> 3289.7
yourself why are you doing this and

3285.39 --> 3294.93
what's going on I I just took that I

3289.7 --> 3297.8689999999997
took that didn't work out

3294.93 --> 3300.93
got really disappointed hateful towards

3297.869 --> 3304.9100000000003
myself like yeah I'm a failure and I can

3300.93 --> 3309.5389999999998
never fix myself dramatic typical

3304.91 --> 3311.42
preteen and teen drama inner dialogue

3309.539 --> 3318.7490000000003
[ __ ]

3311.42 --> 3320.7290000000003
but eventually I guess I always say when

3318.749 --> 3324.1189999999997
I first started smoking cannabis when I

3320.729 --> 3328.019
was 15 I got through a friend of mine

3324.119 --> 3331.1400000000003
suddenly I calmed down calm the [ __ ]

3328.019 --> 3336.1499999999996
down from all this nervous and anxious

3331.14 --> 3340.049
in a monologue [ __ ] and sadly I was

3336.15 --> 3343.65
older I just had grown more skills that

3340.049 --> 3346.079
I never even got to using also socially

3343.65 --> 3350.539
communicatively I hadn't though I had my

3346.079 --> 3357.42
lower voice finally fully fully grown

3350.539 --> 3359.969
for a while and got into it and yeah it

3357.42 --> 3361.44
suddenly I got these new angles like oh

3359.969 --> 3364.109
my god now I can learn to actually

3361.44 --> 3366.7490000000003
socialize with other people that kind of

3364.109 --> 3370.259
respect me and suddenly a new world

3366.749 --> 3373.049
broke open and I immediately as a reflex

3370.259 --> 3377.309
on what my parents taught me like that

3373.049 --> 3379.349
means that now I can finally do what

3377.309 --> 3381.449
they told me and actually start building

3379.349 --> 3383.779
myself up and doing the skills and I've

3381.449 --> 3390.539
been doing that ever since

3383.779 --> 3393.63
so there you got my story my long long

3390.539 --> 3397.17
story of what I've been doing in my life

3393.63 --> 3404.6400000000003
how I've been constructing myself how

3397.17 --> 3407.13
that works and the hour is full so I

3404.64 --> 3410.519
hope you enjoyed it maybe a bit long

3407.13 --> 3414.44
