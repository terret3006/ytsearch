yeah Rhys I hope you're doing okay today

155.49 --> 162.58
it's pretty heavy yesterday bit long

159.58 --> 169.9
though you know it was good it was

162.58 --> 172.17000000000002
important but man it was a bit long but

169.9 --> 172.17000000000002
yeah

174.55 --> 182.04000000000002
so it just happened it was good and

179.71 --> 182.04000000000002
interesting

186.9 --> 195.46
so yeah it's been odd but been

192.49 --> 198.28
getting impulses to do been a workout

195.46 --> 200.94
here and there and I'm getting at it and

198.28 --> 205.0
I immediately feel like oh wait this

200.94 --> 208.6
this is good this is also the way to get

205.0 --> 211.09
kind of out of this drinking that I've

208.6 --> 214.93
been doing now of course yeah there's

211.09 --> 217.66
been a lot of entertainment that makes

214.93 --> 226.15
it more much more appealing to go

217.66 --> 231.82
drinking but can't really last kind of

226.15 --> 234.09
glad for it because need to think of my

231.82 --> 234.09
health

234.22 --> 249.07999999999998
get ready for spring and try to step

245.72 --> 257.12
back from looking into the deep try to

249.08 --> 260.81
approach it in a more superficial way

257.12 --> 267.08
it's that yeah how do you approach the

260.81 --> 270.28000000000003
deep in a superficial way yeah what can

267.08 --> 270.28
can be done

279.87 --> 285.51
all right you could just chilling on a

282.94 --> 285.51
Saturday

295.26 --> 300.2
ethics

297.54 --> 300.20000000000005
Cheers

313.63 --> 320.67
Voynich I don't know

322.59 --> 329.73999999999995
there is stuff going on but to me it

326.26 --> 337.93
starts feeling like it's getting all

329.74 --> 341.89
over my head I could talk about things

337.93 --> 344.56
joke things but it feels to me like I

341.89 --> 348.84
just be attention-grabbing to try and

344.56 --> 351.4
compete with this this massive wave of

348.84 --> 358.51
pretty hardcore information that's

351.4 --> 361.23999999999995
coming from everywhere and it's a stupid

358.51 --> 365.46999999999997
thing it just doesn't feel right I don't

361.24 --> 367.83
know why doesn't feel right feels like

365.47 --> 367.83000000000004
new

368.79 --> 376.51000000000005
that's not my new thing that I'm

373.51 --> 381.21
supposed to be doing I don't want to do

376.51 --> 385.18
that but yeah I am looking at it all

381.21 --> 390.54999999999995
when Benjamin is totally piling on the

385.18 --> 394.98
Jews and he's yeah he's shoving it his

390.55 --> 394.98
deft is shoving it in our faces

402.05 --> 405.35
[Music]

407.8 --> 411.66900000000004
oh yeah I finished the rest of the

409.87 --> 414.37
podcast or did I already do that

411.669 --> 417.43
yesterday I'm not sure no wait no I was

414.37 --> 420.879
halfway finished the rest it's pretty

417.43 --> 426.06
heavy oh yeah one thing I definitely

420.879 --> 426.06
noticed that there was a

427.87 --> 435.1
a stream that's available for watching I

432.25 --> 437.44
watched through the Alex Jones Show and

435.1 --> 441.61
there was this weird hang-up really

437.44 --> 444.45
annoying but yeah that was their put on

441.61 --> 447.46000000000004
purpose I'm damn well sure of it

444.45 --> 452.97999999999996
like at some point yet they all been

447.46 --> 458.38
drinking and doing stuff getting getting

452.98 --> 463.75
crazy like taking off the brakes

458.38 --> 466.96
basically like this is such a me me

463.75 --> 469.12
trigger II thing that Alex Jian starts

466.96 --> 472.77
to talk about devil and our turbo is so

469.12 --> 477.81
sexy and then the stream like error

472.77 --> 482.59
stream broken so I tried to like okay

477.81 --> 485.32
what is that yeah reload the screen get

482.59 --> 488.13899999999995
back to that point try to find it at

485.32 --> 492.96
first and then every time at that point

488.139 --> 496.90000000000003
it just breaks and of course of course

492.96 --> 499.85999999999996
you'd be absolutely [ __ ] to think

496.9 --> 503.169
that that wasn't done on purpose

499.86 --> 507.81
probably by Joe Rogan himself because he

503.169 --> 507.81
likes to be a sneaky little devil

508.559 --> 517.139
yeah maybe in a trend of Hoenn Benjamin

513.659 --> 519.149
you could say he has do envy maybe

517.139 --> 522.449
you'll get it maybe we would be like

519.149 --> 524.219
what but yeah

522.449 --> 526.68
Joe definitely likes to be a sneaky

524.219 --> 528.72
little devil and I think that yeah he

526.68 --> 533.54
probably did that just to [ __ ] with

528.72 --> 533.5400000000001
everyone to be more attention-grabbing

537.74 --> 544.189
bachlin they sniped

540.749 --> 548.519
LED out because he was accidentally dude

544.189 --> 553.79
he was being accidentally honest all

548.519 --> 553.79
over the place the entire thing okay

554.959 --> 563.8389999999999
it's just he's very good at chess link

559.529 --> 563.8389999999999
said so before he knows how to

568.06 --> 579.4899999999999
build a narrative out of it all without

574.81 --> 582.1999999999999
taking away the information yet

579.49 --> 586.97
railroading it into a certain mindset

582.2 --> 593.24
all that it it is artistry it is it is

586.97 --> 600.38
wizardry and he's really good at it so

593.24 --> 602.24
yeah what's yeah to see oh he was doing

600.38 --> 605.11
that you're not supposed to reveal that

602.24 --> 605.11
I know

608.63 --> 624.14
but I ever been choked out nope no I

618.79 --> 625.8199999999999
didn't yeah no I think at some point it

624.14 --> 628.91
may have been crazy enough to have that

625.82 --> 632.23
tried but the thing is it doesn't work

628.91 --> 634.64
because reflexes take over as soon as I

632.23 --> 638.1800000000001
threatened to actually pass out it's

634.64 --> 642.86
like bad explosive energy and I just

638.18 --> 650.6899999999999
start to like go berserk so it doesn't

642.86 --> 656.63
work can't do it I'd love to think that

650.69 --> 660.34
it's like a godly protection mechanism

656.63 --> 660.34
or something I don't know what it is

665.17 --> 670.9599999999999
now I don't remember that ever never

668.57 --> 670.96
work

673.01 --> 683.48
[Music]

674.71 --> 686.51
you know right getting right down into

683.48 --> 688.87
the dirt don't you guys you guys just

686.51 --> 688.87
love it

689.65 --> 703.0
hello / Mukul what it says yeah so are

699.26 --> 703.0
you getting drunk on all this mud

710.94 --> 719.08
because yeah you know for all that it's

715.0 --> 723.79
worth I still get pretty damn disgusted

719.08 --> 730.1500000000001
by all of this [ __ ] don't get me wrong

723.79 --> 733.78
like I'm I may be like tolerant in

730.15 --> 736.3
principle but I'm oversensitive and

733.78 --> 740.02
there's just so much stuff out there

736.3 --> 744.8499999999999
that's just so disgusting I I can't even

740.02 --> 747.55
get myself to talk about it and yeah

744.85 --> 748.6800000000001
it's just being thrown out there like oh

747.55 --> 751.8599999999999
there you go

748.68 --> 751.8599999999999
deal with it

757.8 --> 764.3499999999999
yeah what I think about it

760.74 --> 768.4
F earth later I don't care

764.35 --> 772.72
again you did this yesterday like are

768.4 --> 776.35
are you are you like troll shilling for

772.72 --> 778.63
Riley are you like desperate to see us

776.35 --> 781.96
bumping heads again so we can get all

778.63 --> 784.09
inflammatory and see our weenie enrage

781.96 --> 787.96
again oh they are winning rage all the

784.09 --> 790.4200000000001
trolls all they needs it it's so it's so

787.96 --> 794.64
amazing when our wind goes insane

790.42 --> 794.64
now screw you

802.769 --> 811.2090000000001
you know when when I'll go nuts I'll go

807.13 --> 814.72
nuts not because somebody's telling me

811.209 --> 817.7689999999999
not even me it I'll go nuts because it

814.72 --> 817.769
just freaking happens

821.75 --> 826.48
no one ever expects the Iranian rage

829.57 --> 834.7900000000001
and not even me although I do see it

832.389 --> 836.86
coming like swing it's a pendulum then

834.79 --> 838.959
tension starts growing yeah when the

836.86 --> 847.779
tension starts growing it's usually when

838.959 --> 852.399
it risks coming out mmm but yeah that's

847.779 --> 855.1899999999999
gonna be your squeeze puppet like oh

852.399 --> 858.819
let's see what happens when you get him

855.19 --> 861.22
angry no I'm not your freakin squeeze

858.819 --> 865.06
puppet okay I'm an individual I'm a

861.22 --> 868.44
person here going through things having

865.06 --> 872.13
access to all this insight and [ __ ] and

868.44 --> 875.8190000000001
yeah I'm willing to share that with you

872.13 --> 881.43
if you even have the capability of

875.819 --> 884.05
seeing the value of what I can do okay

881.43 --> 894.399
that that's the bigger question can you

884.05 --> 898.6899999999999
see what I can do for you for ya that's

894.399 --> 903.069
mostly for whoever's interested wants to

898.69 --> 907.47
know as an issue they just don't know

903.069 --> 907.4699999999999
how to deal with it I can find a way

907.82 --> 915.36
in that sense I do feel like a

910.08 --> 921.36
pathfinder and I I'm the Scout can look

915.36 --> 923.63
ahead where you can't use it while it's

921.36 --> 923.63
there

931.51 --> 934.74
I'll call and Turner

935.26 --> 940.99
that's up for you to find out you know

938.46 --> 946.51
that's the thing about inside everybody

940.99 --> 950.92
has inside but you don't really see the

946.51 --> 954.84
limits of your own insight until you see

950.92 --> 958.0
somebody else surpassing that inside and

954.84 --> 960.88
then you know and then you'll probably

958.0 --> 967.98
get jealous or be like whoa

960.88 --> 967.98
you'll be humbled that's how it works

971.79 --> 976.8499999999999
and trust me it's not a privilege okay

974.16 --> 976.85
ignorance is bliss

976.94 --> 984.09
knowledge is power power brings

981.08 --> 988.5600000000001
responsibility responsibility brings a

984.09 --> 990.6
lot of strain sometimes I feel like with

988.56 --> 993.63
all that knowledge for whatever it's

990.6 --> 995.64
even worth anymore you know because

993.63 --> 999.78
people are throwing knowledge all over

995.64 --> 1003.14
the place but it makes me feel like oh

999.78 --> 1007.28
yeah I am a dad that's trying to educate

1003.14 --> 1009.74
a bunch of kids and they probably can't

1007.28 --> 1013.13
handle most of it I can barely handle

1009.74 --> 1016.4
most of it and that's yeah that's the

1013.13 --> 1020.87
fantastic experience of having freaking

1016.4 --> 1026.51
knowledge no you it's not as good as you

1020.87 --> 1030.44
think you know like the only real value

1026.51 --> 1035.93
of knowledge is that you can help it

1030.44 --> 1038.3600000000001
with it but help doesn't just manifest

1035.93 --> 1040.79
out of it naturally you have to will it

1038.36 --> 1045.4399999999998
you have to focus on that you have to

1040.79 --> 1047.48
sharpen your your path your methodology

1045.44 --> 1050.06
in order for that to be able to happen

1047.48 --> 1053.05
otherwise it's gonna start a life of its

1050.06 --> 1056.29
own and things will polarize around it

1053.05 --> 1056.29
does always

1057.9 --> 1061.2900000000002
now I don't need a new mic it's not the

1060.75 --> 1063.63
mic

1061.29 --> 1066.1499999999999
you stupid trolls I keep on saying it

1063.63 --> 1069.17
it's not the mic it's the sound system

1066.15 --> 1069.17
and I'm working on it

1070.55 --> 1078.059
the are we nyan shitty sound quality

1073.89 --> 1081.45
okay it's a sad fact that's what it is

1078.059 --> 1083.58
I hope my self is gonna change one day

1081.45 --> 1086.52
because I'm sick of listening to that

1083.58 --> 1094.9099999999999
noise every time I listen back my show

1086.52 --> 1098.07
okay so get over it just it's not my mic

1094.91 --> 1101.01
you know I've done hangouts before this

1098.07 --> 1103.77
not using OBS just using the Hangout

1101.01 --> 1106.95
system it's it's perfectly fine this mic

1103.77 --> 1113.49
is perfectly fine it's not the mic it's

1106.95 --> 1116.28
the sound system okay just links listen

1113.49 --> 1122.01
back to my flat earth talks there's no

1116.28 --> 1126.95
noise it's fine it's not the mic I've

1122.01 --> 1126.95
had this mic from the start it's fine

1127.76 --> 1132.98
and now you're banned [ __ ] off

1144.54 --> 1149.9099999999999

1147.51 --> 1152.8799999999999
is my mic maybe yeah you're you're gonna

1149.91 --> 1160.74
have to pay me to get a new mic because

1152.88 --> 1164.2800000000002
I'm not a rich guy right so if it's such

1160.74 --> 1171.03
a big freaking problem then give me a

1164.28 --> 1173.52
new mic right I don't want to be too

1171.03 --> 1175.92
crazy a comparison it's like walking

1173.52 --> 1180.15
around outside and there's like a bum

1175.92 --> 1183.54
and he's like really shitty stained

1180.15 --> 1185.5800000000002
jacket or whatever you're not gonna go

1183.54 --> 1188.37
to that bum and then just pointing him

1185.58 --> 1189.77
like hey you [ __ ] get a better coat

1188.37 --> 1194.2199999999998
you look disgusting

1189.77 --> 1196.32
that's stupid if you want him to have a

1194.22 --> 1202.56
better coat then give him a better coat

1196.32 --> 1207.0
or stop whining about it you know make

1202.56 --> 1211.23

1214.44 --> 1220.8600000000001
social welfare recipient I have no

1217.47 --> 1224.1000000000001
career except for what I've been doing

1220.86 --> 1227.34
here on YouTube and my research is it's

1224.1 --> 1229.83
all non societal wealth it's all just

1227.34 --> 1232.08
information and skill building that's

1229.83 --> 1236.8799999999999
the wealth I got I have no money I'm

1232.08 --> 1238.71
freakin poor okay and to be fair I'm

1236.88 --> 1242.3600000000001
kind of okay with that

1238.71 --> 1246.42
although yeah it does suck cuz you can

1242.36 --> 1248.34
you can't upgrade so quick or are you

1246.42 --> 1250.95
just gonna have to work your ass off and

1248.34 --> 1254.9599999999998
oh yeah by the way I'm freakin lazy

1250.95 --> 1254.96
thanks thanks me

1259.86 --> 1267.6999999999998
but yeah eventually always the laziness

1264.43 --> 1272.14
turns around and then just goes into a

1267.7 --> 1274.99
frenzy and I do things extremely quickly

1272.14 --> 1276.25
and precisely and like I wanted done now

1274.99 --> 1280.18
now now

1276.25 --> 1283.12
yeah that's that's just the freakin way

1280.18 --> 1286.48
I work it's how I've done school it

1283.12 --> 1288.3999999999999
worked like lazy asked around played

1286.48 --> 1290.92
Magic the Gathering and primitive

1288.4 --> 1295.6200000000001
role-playing games all freaking day in

1290.92 --> 1298.27
school like in school all day all day

1295.62 --> 1301.3899999999999
barely even take the trouble to go to

1298.27 --> 1304.3899999999999
classes I didn't care and then at the

1301.39 --> 1307.1200000000001
last moment to figure out like wait hmm

1304.39 --> 1309.5700000000002
I might need to catch up on this and go

1307.12 --> 1312.4299999999998
to the class hear what's going on

1309.57 --> 1313.9299999999998
immediately notice where everyone is

1312.43 --> 1316.78
stuck where the teachers are stuck where

1313.93 --> 1319.99
the students are stuck and solve it

1316.78 --> 1324.6
right on the spot improvised bang and in

1319.99 --> 1327.73
doing so also learn the material and

1324.6 --> 1330.1899999999998
then after that brush up of the finer

1327.73 --> 1332.74
details that everyone else has actually

1330.19 --> 1335.26
learned that because just memorizing

1332.74 --> 1338.16
[ __ ] never been really started that the

1335.26 --> 1340.75
memorization is the aftermath for me

1338.16 --> 1342.6000000000001
it's just like okay eventually you

1340.75 --> 1346.96
figure out what's actually important

1342.6 --> 1349.09
then once you figure that out then it's

1346.96 --> 1351.3700000000001
like okay the rest is [ __ ] I'm gonna

1349.09 --> 1354.49
remember this because it's important

1351.37 --> 1356.85
it's as a frequency that will reach

1354.49 --> 1360.15
through a lot of time into the future so

1356.85 --> 1360.1499999999999
it'll stick

1367.83 --> 1371.22
so yeah

1374.93 --> 1382.41
all right fine each so yeah rich Arwen

1379.41 --> 1386.49
in secret he is so deceptive yeah I'm so

1382.41 --> 1389.7900000000002
rich so secretly and so deceptive that

1386.49 --> 1395.69
if I have this wealth I don't know about

1389.79 --> 1395.69
it and I have no access to it so yeah

1398.6 --> 1405.06
right how creepy would that be one day

1403.08 --> 1408.1499999999999
you just figure out like oh yeah yeah oh

1405.06 --> 1410.37
by the way we saved like a hundred

1408.15 --> 1412.5300000000002
million euros or something on your bank

1410.37 --> 1421.56
account you ordered us to keep that a

1412.53 --> 1424.71
secret from you that yeah but yeah you

1421.56 --> 1427.2
can community imagine that to be

1424.71 --> 1429.96
something this kind of seems kind of

1427.2 --> 1431.99
pointless it's much better to just learn

1429.96 --> 1435.83
to deal with what you got

1431.99 --> 1435.83
however little that may be

1465.23 --> 1473.85
so come on guys get in here or or not

1470.88 --> 1476.0900000000001
just let me ramble on in my weird little

1473.85 --> 1476.09
only

1509.08 --> 1517.899
right right P Morris piece P MARSOC yeah

1515.019 --> 1522.129
I have seen some really cool microphones

1517.899 --> 1524.4399999999998
for sale indeed like 50 bucks more good

1522.129 --> 1527.35
stuff there's really awesome microphones

1524.44 --> 1533.2
for sale out there that are worth more

1527.35 --> 1536.59
than 2 euro 50 you know but yeah this

1533.2 --> 1540.309
one works fine for the price it is it

1536.59 --> 1545.769
works really awesome super basic it'll

1540.309 --> 1551.44
last but yeah it's not super awesome and

1545.769 --> 1553.029
has no pop filter mechanism and yeah it

1551.44 --> 1556.059
will be kind of interesting to have like

1553.029 --> 1557.919
a more a better microphone in front of

1556.059 --> 1560.559
me like with the standard so I can move

1557.919 --> 1567.249
it around [ __ ] and be all oh I'm so

1560.559 --> 1570.129
studio Oh so pros I'm so studio mmm

1567.249 --> 1576.239
but yeah I'm freaking for so it doesn't

1570.129 --> 1576.2389999999998
work unless you yeah yes make me get it

1587.13 --> 1593.0390000000002
look Effie Vader if you're gonna be all

1589.98 --> 1598.23
anal about my freaking microphone okay

1593.039 --> 1600.6299999999999
I'm gonna shove it up your ass and that

1598.23 --> 1603.8600000000001
means I'm gonna ban you so stop whining

1600.63 --> 1603.8600000000001
about my damn microphone

1613.419 --> 1618.8890000000001
right well rap repa Diggs I don't think

1616.729 --> 1619.279
there are any cheaper microphones than

1618.889 --> 1621.9189999999999
this

1619.279 --> 1623.839
there are pretend good ones that are

1621.919 --> 1627.8590000000002
slightly more expensive they'll break

1623.839 --> 1630.549
after a week probably but as it comes to

1627.859 --> 1633.619
cheapness I think this is pretty much it

1630.549 --> 1643.4189999999999
and it's really good for the price it's

1633.619 --> 1647.4499999999998
amazing that's right

1643.419 --> 1649.1290000000001
Jonathan Doherty cheap mics are ok as

1647.45 --> 1651.8590000000002
long as they don't freakin break it's

1649.129 --> 1655.2189999999998
the pretend expensive things that

1651.859 --> 1661.1589999999999
actually break that's the [ __ ] that is

1655.219 --> 1665.1190000000001
trash it's pretentious it's seductive

1661.159 --> 1668.44
and it's just gonna end on the junk pile

1665.119 --> 1668.4399999999998
more junk goody

1672.2 --> 1681.669
oh hey maybe you want to come back sure

1686.35 --> 1693.279
yeah don't really you K I send you the

1689.059 --> 1693.279
link so it's up to you

1709.6 --> 1716.4699999999998
we want to ask you about my teeth goody

1712.87 --> 1719.1399999999999
well that's gonna be a weird

1716.47 --> 1722.56
conversation if that's if you and Ellie

1719.14 --> 1725.01
b-but sure you ask me about my face you

1722.56 --> 1725.01
go ahead

1740.34 --> 1747.85
my skin is like taking a beating from

1744.46 --> 1750.1000000000001
all this freaking alcohol I think think

1747.85 --> 1757.6299999999999
that's it I don't know you know with me

1750.1 --> 1760.6299999999999
it's my lip my skin sucks it's okay

1757.63 --> 1763.14
it seems very young but it has a lot of

1760.63 --> 1766.98
problems and it that sucks

1763.14 --> 1766.98
makes me feel ugly

1768.04 --> 1774.3999999999999
but yeah you know the real ugliness or

1772.51 --> 1776.26
beauty's pretty much how I feel that's

1774.4 --> 1778.75
where people reflect upon they don't

1776.26 --> 1782.05
really look at the skin and seriously

1778.75 --> 1785.14
just walking out there there is so many

1782.05 --> 1789.8999999999999
people with skin problems like this so

1785.14 --> 1792.3400000000001
many and it's obvious that they don't

1789.9 --> 1794.38
they don't really know what to do about

1792.34 --> 1797.31
it they can't really find a solution

1794.38 --> 1800.17
just use like yeah it's there it's just

1797.31 --> 1802.81
yeah you can go to a doctor and let

1800.17 --> 1806.74
yourself be experimented upon but yeah

1802.81 --> 1808.57
that's rarely gonna work out and most

1806.74 --> 1812.29
people have probably wizened up to this

1808.57 --> 1816.84
and just like okay I just have sucky

1812.29 --> 1822.6299999999999
skin let's hope it some day changes or

1816.84 --> 1822.6299999999999
yeah but yeah I'm not the only one

1826.98 --> 1836.09
god what questions

1848.93 --> 1855.77
wait psychics war is that a reference to

1852.56 --> 1858.77
Alex Jones podcasts and everything

1855.77 --> 1858.77
because

1859.51 --> 1869.89
I have some freaky questions right bkk

1867.49 --> 1874.18
dave yeah coconut oil can be kind of

1869.89 --> 1876.7900000000002
good and it is it's it seems to be

1874.18 --> 1878.5900000000001
generally helpful but it doesn't take

1876.79 --> 1882.1599999999999
away skin problems

1878.59 --> 1885.55
it hasn't really it's just external

1882.16 --> 1889.51
feeding and the same work for eating it

1885.55 --> 1893.35
now finally I got myself to to actually

1889.51 --> 1896.98
cook a bigger meal that can last me for

1893.35 --> 1901.99
four days and I had been postponing that

1896.98 --> 1904.57
for three days it's so stupid like not

1901.99 --> 1908.32
really having a proper dinner for three

1904.57 --> 1910.54
days it's stupid again it's just I

1908.32 --> 1912.6399999999999
didn't wanna I didn't want to spend like

1910.54 --> 1913.81
two hours making all that every time

1912.64 --> 1916.0600000000002
it's so stupid

1913.81 --> 1918.6599999999999
I should just do it so I just say I just

1916.06 --> 1922.09
did it like screw this I'm gonna do this

1918.66 --> 1926.14
I'm gonna let all these vegetables all

1922.09 --> 1928.9599999999998
go Brown and [ __ ] I'm just gonna make it

1926.14 --> 1933.5200000000002
I'm very glad I did it was it was and

1928.96 --> 1937.29
will be delicious and I do I put a giant

1933.52 --> 1937.29
amount of coconut oil in there

1937.57 --> 1949.1689999999999
it's basic organic royal green coconut

1943.029 --> 1949.169
oil and yeah eating it is awesome

1953.48 --> 1959.929
and I feel so much better like yeah you

1957.32 --> 1964.07
know eating dinner is better for you

1959.929 --> 1967.909
than not eating dinner mmm thank you our

1964.07 --> 1969.5
win Captain Obvious but yeah well on the

1967.909 --> 1973.029
other hand if you're just gonna eat like

1969.5 --> 1976.82
cheap-ass French fries and all this

1973.029 --> 1979.549
fried weird stuff and you're gonna do

1976.82 --> 1982.039
that three days then probably not eating

1979.549 --> 1984.35
instead is probably gonna be healthier

1982.039 --> 1987.289
all right all depends on one year what

1984.35 --> 1989.809
are you gonna eat beside that what are

1987.289 --> 1996.1299999999999
you going to be snacking on and I did

1989.809 --> 1996.1299999999999
eat stuff like bread bunch of cheese

1996.98 --> 2004.6
so I didn't literally starve oh yeah I

2002.11 --> 2006.76
ate a bunch of organic type chips here

2004.6 --> 2009.9089999999999
and there that kind of thing so I did

2006.76 --> 2012.61
not completely eaten nothing but still

2009.909 --> 2016.75
there's nothing is nothing can replace

2012.61 --> 2022.7099999999998
and actually well-prepared attention

2016.75 --> 2022.71
given elaborate organic homemade dinner

2034.22 --> 2041.09
so I guess Dawn Treader is not coming in

2037.72 --> 2044.509
it's just pretend because yeah I sent

2041.09 --> 2046.879
him the link even before the Hangout

2044.509 --> 2049.579
it's a hangout head started up so this

2046.879 --> 2053.7999999999997
is all on you da threader it's all on

2049.579 --> 2053.8
you you're you're the one not coming in

2071.98 --> 2079.3
oh yeah one thing one thing that would

2075.28 --> 2084.7000000000003
be good to have a better microphone for

2079.3 --> 2087.7000000000003
is that this microphone apparently seems

2084.7 --> 2090.49
to be unable to pick up certain types of

2087.7 --> 2092.22
sound and that was kind of disappointing

2090.49 --> 2095.8289999999997
has been for a while

2092.22 --> 2098.3199999999997
hello leb thanks for joining

2095.829 --> 2103.48
no no what is so you dude did you hear

2098.32 --> 2108.28
me Jamie oh hang on now you got no

2103.48 --> 2111.4
camera by the way if you want it I can

2108.28 --> 2115.69
hear you can you get me no yes ANCA see

2111.4 --> 2120.849
good see Randall no but anyway yeah

2115.69 --> 2124.599
because I have this the sound Bowl from

2120.849 --> 2127.21
these very special one one that I even

2124.599 --> 2132.04
rumored can't really confirm that I got

2127.21 --> 2134.109
it from a special shop that I could

2132.04 --> 2137.95
never find back so I wonder like yeah

2134.109 --> 2141.7
was that even in this realm or what did

2137.95 --> 2144.3999999999996
I drink too much absent during the time

2141.7 --> 2148.319
which I did and then just wandered off

2144.4 --> 2151.3
in some weird extra dimensional shop

2148.319 --> 2153.43
yeah I try to find it back I don't know

2151.3 --> 2155.53
where the store is or where it was it's

2153.43 --> 2160.44
weird but I got this amazing sound Bowl

2155.53 --> 2160.44
and the microphone just can't pick it up

2161.8 --> 2166.75
I tried it once like if really early on

2164.5 --> 2168.55
even before the Flat Earth talks I tried

2166.75 --> 2177.25
it out and just nobody could hear

2168.55 --> 2178.6600000000003
anything are you still talking about the

2177.25 --> 2180.19
microphone Arwen yeah

2178.66 --> 2183.1
have you tried have you tried turning

2180.19 --> 2185.38
your mic volume down a bit or your

2183.1 --> 2189.0099999999998
output layer will enter your obvious

2185.38 --> 2195.2200000000003
though number may be no I tried

2189.01 --> 2198.4900000000002
everything it's not the microphone it is

2195.22 --> 2201.85
the channels by through which all the

2198.49 --> 2203.5899999999997
sounds go that's what I mean but you're

2201.85 --> 2206.2
any good you're any put into them

2203.59 --> 2207.4
channels could be true high your keys

2206.2 --> 2208.96
you've got a definitely of you'll have a

2207.4 --> 2210.73
volume for your mic then you'll have the

2208.96 --> 2213.34
volume for the channel it's going

2210.73 --> 2217.33
directly into the sound card on the back

2213.34 --> 2219.31
of my computer in the microphone in line

2217.33 --> 2227.0099999999998
and I got a really good sound card like

2219.31 --> 2231.49
a really good good officer man right

2227.01 --> 2235.73
after all I'll just rolling a smart am I

2231.49 --> 2241.0099999999998
gonna drink alright

2235.73 --> 2258.38
I haven't gone become wrong that's fine

2241.01 --> 2262.0690000000004
I leave it up to you I didn't see I

2258.38 --> 2270.52
don't know what a sound Bowl is it's a

2262.069 --> 2276.74
piece of mail oh yeah I do yeah you can

2270.52 --> 2278.0
you can hit it like a bell you can

2276.74 --> 2281.4199999999996
probably barely even hear it

2278.0 --> 2284.42
Oh picks up alright yeah it picks

2281.42 --> 2287.059
something up but when I actually start

2284.42 --> 2288.92
to rub it the right way then the sound

2287.059 --> 2291.049
that comes from it is so low and so

2288.92 --> 2292.579
penetrating I don't think that

2291.049 --> 2295.67
microphone can actually pick that up

2292.579 --> 2297.71
although everyone in probably a radius

2295.67 --> 2302.7200000000003
of 100 meter right through the building

2297.71 --> 2306.02
will hear it huh I tried it again last

2302.72 --> 2308.8089999999997
night it looks cold it is it is amazing

2306.02 --> 2311.869
this thing is amazing it's one of the

2308.809 --> 2313.2200000000003
most amazing sound producing devices

2311.869 --> 2317.569
that I've ever come across especially

2313.22 --> 2321.3799999999997
because the low sound it can produce is

2317.569 --> 2326.65
so incredibly low for the size of this

2321.38 --> 2326.65
thing because I've heard I've seen like

2326.809 --> 2333.15
people playing this profession and they

2329.46 --> 2337.319
have like poles freaking insanely huge

2333.15 --> 2340.71
I'd probably use that it doesn't go as

2337.319 --> 2342.72
low as this thing does I probably used

2340.71 --> 2347.25
it in a ritual instead of a gong or

2342.72 --> 2355.2889999999998
something instead of a gong I'd use that

2347.25 --> 2358.22
in a ritual sound Bowl yeah I don't know

2355.289 --> 2358.2200000000003
a magic ritual

2364.08 --> 2376.34
I just like to experience the magic of

2368.25 --> 2380.03
sound itself yeah watch me is ritual Oh

2376.34 --> 2380.03
don't just dropped open

2382.77 --> 2388.53
oh yeah I see I don't really mind can

2386.49 --> 2389.7
come back so whoa whoa whoa have you

2388.53 --> 2391.44
been watching they not when have you

2389.7 --> 2393.4199999999996
been watching any videos or what have

2391.44 --> 2395.39
you been rocking on Lisa's very press

2393.42 --> 2399.63
the wrong button

2395.39 --> 2403.29
yeah I've been watching the second half

2399.63 --> 2408.77
of the podcast yesterday Joe Rogan and

2403.29 --> 2412.58
Alex Jones yeah all that did you think

2408.77 --> 2417.84
it was a big and scary as [ __ ] and

2412.58 --> 2420.66
enlightening and nauseating and it was a

2417.84 --> 2423.48
it was everything it was it all full

2420.66 --> 2425.3399999999997
spectrum painting you're like Joe not

2423.48 --> 2428.37
Joe Rogan I don't know that I think he's

2425.34 --> 2429.8
about shitty oh you think you think he's

2428.37 --> 2432.75
a bit Shady

2429.8 --> 2434.8700000000003
really I thought the podcast what right

2432.75 --> 2437.37
if the hint

2434.87 --> 2439.83
they are just through watching him for a

2437.37 --> 2442.41
long period of time and slowly but

2439.83 --> 2444.27
surely taking my time in passing

2442.41 --> 2448.2
judgment you know using my own critical

2444.27 --> 2450.69
thing but he definitely it was wrong it

2448.2 --> 2454.35
was more prevalent where Alex joins them

2450.69 --> 2456.27
he came down really nice what Donna was

2454.35 --> 2458.73
always about suspicions where I thought

2456.27 --> 2460.92
he's about a shady character for her yes

2458.73 --> 2463.59
as I say it's just that interview Alex

2460.92 --> 2465.78
Jones and the way that he was he was

2463.59 --> 2468.54
they always surprised about the facts oh

2465.78 --> 2470.57
oh yeah yeah when he's on his own he's

2468.54 --> 2472.89
more far out but then when he's with

2470.57 --> 2474.54
Alex Jones yesterday like turn it down

2472.89 --> 2477.98
don't even be the reasonable one well he

2474.54 --> 2477.98
doesn't have to but that's why he does a

2478.31 --> 2483.56
show he takes the opposite position make

2482.73 --> 2486.02
the

2483.56 --> 2487.04
all things flow there was great as the

2486.02 --> 2491.84
podcast was fun

2487.04 --> 2495.05
well good okay right oh you can call it

2491.84 --> 2496.94
fun they did sir Eddie Bravo what did

2495.05 --> 2498.92
you think your happenin Arwen hope how

2496.94 --> 2501.59
did he come across to you did he come

2498.92 --> 2503.9
across as he expected all yay or do you

2501.59 --> 2505.4300000000003
think that he's changed or cuz I've not

2503.9 --> 2506.87
seen the guy for the way when the Sun

2505.43 --> 2509.5099999999998
definitely boat man can't walk they

2506.87 --> 2513.5899999999997
water just the way that he was acting it

2509.51 --> 2515.6600000000003
was funny it was his f it was his f I

2513.59 --> 2517.52
could feel you know how you can sense

2515.66 --> 2519.5299999999997
things off people even if it's coming

2517.52 --> 2522.85
through you can see those phases of my

2519.53 --> 2526.3700000000003
body language it just seemed to me as if

2522.85 --> 2529.22
he was like on Joe Rogan side and he was

2526.37 --> 2531.71
like Solly taking the purser are Alex

2529.22 --> 2534.14
Jordan yeah no but they were confronting

2531.71 --> 2536.66
him both of them Alex Jones trigger

2534.14 --> 2539.27
trigger their best dream well not that

2536.66 --> 2543.0699999999997
tisha triggered and then when he first

2539.27 --> 2545.9
when he first came in right but also

2543.07 --> 2548.96
like Eddie Bravo is really interesting

2545.9 --> 2551.7200000000003
it interested in actually trying to get

2548.96 --> 2554.3
Alex Jones to get into Flat Earth for

2551.72 --> 2556.58
real because alex is a master of evasion

2554.3 --> 2559.67
like he gets pissed off from it

2556.58 --> 2563.96
he has seriously serious Flat Earth

2559.67 --> 2567.17
allergies whoo and it's annoying to them

2563.96 --> 2570.14
because beside that everything he does

2567.17 --> 2574.25
is really special and revealing well yes

2570.14 --> 2577.3399999999997
is burning it's a burden to to Eddie

2574.25 --> 2580.28
Bravo because that allergy he has

2577.34 --> 2583.61
doesn't really allow him to connect with

2580.28 --> 2586.13
him fully oh yeah what about what about

2583.61 --> 2588.4100000000003
the fact or they all look at it from the

2586.13 --> 2590.27
other point of view look Ali only

2588.41 --> 2591.77
students explored and Peter fails

2590.27 --> 2592.19
government corruption and stuff like

2591.77 --> 2594.14
that

2592.19 --> 2597.56
he could be just looking at fly off and

2594.14 --> 2599.6
thank him yeah you know I mean it's like

2597.56 --> 2602.81
a veil event but he wouldn't have it's

2599.6 --> 2604.7
cold yeah when he's when he saw reading

2602.81 --> 2607.73
articles about kids getting raped and

2604.7 --> 2610.2799999999997
people getting mugged aunt and freedoms

2607.73 --> 2613.01
getting taken away right and he balances

2610.28 --> 2614.03
off with a flat I think it was well it's

2613.01 --> 2614.53
like for a lurker

2614.03 --> 2616.7200000000003
you know I

2614.53 --> 2619.15
you know fly after as important but as I

2616.72 --> 2621.5499999999997
see those dollars can you know we're

2619.15 --> 2624.4900000000002
losing our freedoms and ignites there

2621.55 --> 2626.4100000000003
yeah I agree but losing our freedoms

2624.49 --> 2627.0699999999997
every sake and just now have just lost

2626.41 --> 2628.8999999999996
another one

2627.07 --> 2633.28
I'm always another one in five minutes

2628.9 --> 2635.14
and they'll be more a control upon us so

2633.28 --> 2637.48
I think by the time that maybe the flyer

2635.14 --> 2639.7
of the school means to be more of a lien

2637.48 --> 2640.9900000000002
it'll be too late month no bit early it

2639.7 --> 2645.43
just seems yeah

2640.99 --> 2647.6189999999997
hey Justine I agree that's exactly how

2645.43 --> 2649.2999999999997
that works different levels in it of

2647.619 --> 2656.8
what people are into what what they want

2649.3 --> 2659.17
to express themselves in yeah yep but

2656.8 --> 2662.44
yeah BOM just seen you maybe Alex Jones

2659.17 --> 2665.17
looks at from that point of view yeah I

2662.44 --> 2667.06
guess I totally understand I do see how

2665.17 --> 2669.28
flying off could be a sigh or even

2667.06 --> 2671.08
though it's real I can still see how

2669.28 --> 2672.849
though I've just waited to roll out

2671.08 --> 2675.0699999999997
because no I'm going for the best sure

2672.849 --> 2676.48
Alex Jones questions reality in his own

2675.07 --> 2678.6400000000003
time like he spoke about looking at the

2676.48 --> 2680.23
moon and thought oh yeah it looks so

2678.64 --> 2682.6299999999997
fake and it looks so beautiful at the

2680.23 --> 2686.83
same time but he just doesn't want to

2682.63 --> 2688.69
declare himself on his job you know what

2686.83 --> 2691.42
I've been doing stuff ten years is

2688.69 --> 2693.91
bringing you know your things are

2691.42 --> 2696.79
happening real time things that's that's

2693.91 --> 2699.49
causing you know humanity to be silly

2696.79 --> 2700.96
you know we're gonna run out I'll spare

2699.49 --> 2702.9399999999996
my something man you know I mean this

2700.96 --> 2705.25
let's breathe in his gonna stop it

2702.94 --> 2707.26
somebody stepped up on this podcast I

2705.25 --> 2711.04
don't they from beautiful rings yeah

2707.26 --> 2713.67
yeah yeah extra dimensional alien

2711.04 --> 2716.74
contact its demons and all that [ __ ] I

2713.67 --> 2718.75
can kinda I can kinda bull out me but

2716.74 --> 2721.4799999999996
personally myself I'm not I'm not

2718.75 --> 2723.31
convinced of it back in accept it as it

2721.48 --> 2725.17
could I believe it like metaphorically I

2723.31 --> 2729.7
think that's pretty much true I like I

2725.17 --> 2732.4
love David Icke right yeah I've seen it

2729.7 --> 2735.89
it's literal yeah I think some of it is

2732.4 --> 2740.4
yeah all of it

2735.89 --> 2743.5499999999997
what you've seen demons look I've been

2740.4 --> 2746.55
in the dark world okay I almost

2743.55 --> 2748.3100000000004
everything I described I probably seemed

2746.55 --> 2751.98
one way or the other

2748.31 --> 2756.0
like I try to say like yeah I've seen

2751.98 --> 2757.44
some like terrible [ __ ] that I just wish

2756.0 --> 2760.74
I didn't

2757.44 --> 2763.23
I will see that but but could that be

2760.74 --> 2765.8399999999997
could that be to do with the the state

2763.23 --> 2768.3
of y'all the state of your mind at that

2765.84 --> 2770.31
specific time that that was happening

2768.3 --> 2773.96
so he's like self and just like they say

2770.31 --> 2776.88
about DMT it's as maybe our self induced

2773.96 --> 2779.1
ain't nothing because of no big the big

2776.88 --> 2782.31
one was definitely not self induced

2779.1 --> 2785.3399999999997
although I did just like Alex describes

2782.31 --> 2788.64
he has in his youth have a lot of

2785.34 --> 2792.36
natural experiences like all throughout

2788.64 --> 2795.6299999999997
my life my youth from my first memories

2792.36 --> 2797.07
on well I'm not the artist yet what do

2795.63 --> 2798.9300000000003
you think a lesson are when right here's

2797.07 --> 2801.9300000000003
here's a we story for you from ah from

2798.93 --> 2804.66
me right I was about five or six years

2801.93 --> 2807.66
old right and I can remember how it used

2804.66 --> 2809.64
to I like we used to sleep with my but

2807.66 --> 2811.74
all on bunk beds you know like a bed

2809.64 --> 2815.19
Dona and I used to sleep on the top bunk

2811.74 --> 2816.4199999999996
and I remember one morning I literally

2815.19 --> 2818.94
shut up

2816.42 --> 2820.8
straight up in bed a tunnel leads to the

2818.94 --> 2822.81
Seder maybe I was a bit sex or something

2820.8 --> 2826.4700000000003
but there's a basic system and I

2822.81 --> 2828.63
actually seen myself less thing less

2826.47 --> 2831.18
apparition John poem it was me

2828.63 --> 2833.94
right and it ran towards the bedroom

2831.18 --> 2836.25
door right and the door was open I know

2833.94 --> 2839.1
they ran towards the bedroom door and

2836.25 --> 2841.74
just stopped and rounded giggled in this

2839.1 --> 2844.5899999999997
appeal and that that was that was me

2841.74 --> 2847.5
that I feel is F and it jumped it was me

2844.59 --> 2850.05
jumping or me and just as he ran it just

2847.5 --> 2852.21
as I ran out the door you know as he ran

2850.05 --> 2854.78
out the door shall see he just Tom din

2852.21 --> 2858.93
giggled and the Sunna seamless plane a

2854.78 --> 2861.1200000000003
plane is the same thing it was really

2858.93 --> 2863.46
real everyone and I thought oh god

2861.12 --> 2866.0699999999997
something's left me you know it was only

2863.46 --> 2868.33
older a sort of size thing I know it and

2866.07 --> 2870.2200000000003
and I was

2868.33 --> 2872.58
I stole the wool but something left me

2870.22 --> 2875.7099999999996
then what about that but that was you

2872.58 --> 2878.89
from a moment back because that had

2875.71 --> 2880.9900000000002
already happened but it happened on the

2878.89 --> 2884.64
other side and that time is not that

2880.99 --> 2888.25
bound so you could have jumped out and

2884.64 --> 2889.12
then that actually happened later after

2888.25 --> 2893.56
you woke up

2889.12 --> 2895.0899999999997
I honestly felt well my mom my thing my

2893.56 --> 2896.47
personal opinion last night I mean

2895.09 --> 2899.98
that's perfectly feasible what you see

2896.47 --> 2902.41
I'm maybe gonna agree but deeper I was

2899.98 --> 2905.95
thinking of his I really thought of his

2902.41 --> 2908.83
Eisley part of me my being my soul it

2905.95 --> 2910.45
was it was a part of me though babies

2908.83 --> 2912.16
happening in real time it happened

2910.45 --> 2915.0699999999997
didn't happen in another dimension

2912.16 --> 2917.35
it had the other sort and I don't and I

2915.07 --> 2919.0
I'm not thinking it's a thing I've done

2917.35 --> 2923.94
before it happened in another dimension

2919.0 --> 2928.18
huh that look can there's like a Midway

2923.94 --> 2930.13
there's a transition okay there's the

2928.18 --> 2933.22
dark world which is completely outside

2930.13 --> 2935.77
of reality in the imagination collective

2933.22 --> 2938.29
imagination whatever it's the the first

2935.77 --> 2941.74
big layer but there's transition stages

2938.29 --> 2944.2599999999998
it's well describes process even as you

2941.74 --> 2947.2599999999998
go into a trip and even our Jones talked

2944.26 --> 2949.71
about it it's a transition so things of

2947.26 --> 2953.4100000000003
the spiritual will actually then be

2949.71 --> 2956.38
integrated with the physical still it's

2953.41 --> 2959.74
a transition I think I think he needs to

2956.38 --> 2962.8
watch himself without know to go down a

2959.74 --> 2964.39
path that could be a distraction of and

2962.8 --> 2970.9300000000003
I don't mean he's doing on purpose but

2964.39 --> 2974.8599999999997
you know it's very David Icke mark

2970.93 --> 2977.1699999999996
possio this is that so dangerous oh I

2974.86 --> 2980.77
love it I think David Icke was freaking

2977.17 --> 2983.05
right yeah he was standing was one of my

2980.77 --> 2986.2
thoughts all the same story like David

2983.05 --> 2988.1200000000003
Icke says rule lizards when he's also

2986.2 --> 2990.58
saying it's extra-dimensional and that's

2988.12 --> 2993.79
just how things roll in the extra

2990.58 --> 2996.91
dimension in here it's no humans but

2993.79 --> 2999.22
there no it's not all humans and the

2996.91 --> 3000.68
humans are not all humans it's a

2999.22 --> 3002.4199999999996
different wavelength they're not

3000.68 --> 3004.3999999999996
not let's tell thing is it is it's an

3002.42 --> 3007.52
extra dimension it's the extra layer on

3004.4 --> 3009.079
top and there is more and the some of

3007.52 --> 3011.5099999999998
them that can actually manifest

3009.079 --> 3014.51
physically and have an effect it's just

3011.51 --> 3017.9
my opinion it's not like a just a theory

3014.51 --> 3020.75
that I have is that sometimes these

3017.9 --> 3023.17
things can actually be themself physical

3020.75 --> 3026.18
not seen at all I think knows good and

3023.17 --> 3029.4500000000003
in bad and I think there's only a select

3026.18 --> 3031.8799999999997
you maybe from the other side seam heel

3029.45 --> 3035.0
that know that secret most hokum any

3031.88 --> 3042.109
less lot of humans most GM are just

3035.0 --> 3045.349
humans or remnants of humans shadows no

3042.109 --> 3050.27
do you think so uh nothing at all yeah

3045.349 --> 3053.089
yeah I do know I checked it like even my

3050.27 --> 3054.859
ear agrees on these details like yeah

3053.089 --> 3060.339
there's still shadows of people on the

3054.859 --> 3063.489
other side that are dead here

3060.339 --> 3066.7889999999998
and their shadow can still be there and

3063.489 --> 3070.569
do [ __ ] and it's never gonna end up good

3066.789 --> 3072.5490000000004
for them all right well I don't I don't

3070.569 --> 3075.88
think nothing these are separate from

3072.549 --> 3077.559
that Sadie you're talking about I don't

3075.88 --> 3080.0190000000002
think that actually does I mean do you

3077.559 --> 3083.529
the true extra dimensionals that really

3080.019 --> 3086.3799999999997
come from the a total different the

3083.529 --> 3089.71
non-human and that's why those are

3086.38 --> 3091.989
freaky weird things those are the the

3089.71 --> 3094.089
pyramids for example with the ID

3091.989 --> 3098.4
pyramids in the clouds that kind of

3094.089 --> 3102.43
shift there's many of these weird freaky

3098.4 --> 3105.9990000000003
magical entity constructs as it were

3102.43 --> 3111.3999999999996
that are sentient somehow and they they

3105.999 --> 3113.41
meddle with humanity yeah the thing the

3111.4 --> 3115.779
key to get up from there dimension to

3113.41 --> 3119.0389999999998
this dimension thing of like nothing you

3115.779 --> 3124.239
know by doing is how they try to see us

3119.039 --> 3126.849
try to get over there I take some of it

3124.239 --> 3128.589
metaphorically like it's human ancient

3126.849 --> 3130.9
bloodlines here as human but they're

3128.589 --> 3133.45
using their reptile brain to manipulate

3130.9 --> 3135.849
and they're talking to extra dimensions

3133.45 --> 3138.91
whether it's real or not yeah I think so

3135.849 --> 3141.19
and I think maybe they yeah they Libra

3138.91 --> 3143.2
manifested through meditation or

3141.19 --> 3144.759
something they'll ceremony you know I

3143.2 --> 3146.979
mean I take it literally but I'm happy

3144.759 --> 3148.9
if it is just metaphorical I don't know

3146.979 --> 3154.6189999999997
obviously there's a nuance between that

3148.9 --> 3159.9100000000003
there is no there is no physical

3154.619 --> 3165.9990000000003
crocodile salamander humanoid yeah I

3159.91 --> 3168.7889999999998
mean it's it's manifestation yeah their

3165.999 --> 3172.66
essence so in order to archetype your

3168.789 --> 3175.96
spirit crystallizes in your frequency

3172.66 --> 3179.5699999999997
and it reflects in a personified image

3175.96 --> 3183.4700000000003
and there is just different types

3179.57 --> 3186.6800000000003
yeah yeah I'll go with that I'm good

3183.47 --> 3188.06
what up now hold on but is it sassy I

3186.68 --> 3189.91
think it's not it's not a thing I used

3188.06 --> 3196.42
to talk about stuff like that when my

3189.91 --> 3199.16
friends me my friend look I talked about

3196.42 --> 3200.63
this [ __ ] with like my gothic friends

3199.16 --> 3203.18
and everything and they like literally

3200.63 --> 3205.73
thought I was crazy but they were just

3203.18 --> 3208.97
freaking fascinated about the craziness

3205.73 --> 3210.95
and I'd like I threw it out there almost

3208.97 --> 3213.0499999999997
like Alex Jones just threw it out there

3210.95 --> 3214.2799999999997
but it wasn't on the internet it was

3213.05 --> 3217.4900000000002
just to people

3214.28 --> 3219.98
yeah raise the door can you shut up for

3217.49 --> 3221.6
a second when I'm talking then when I

3219.98 --> 3225.23
actually do that

3221.6 --> 3228.56
afterward I remember like what came out

3225.23 --> 3233.15
of there because I'm just like I don't

3228.56 --> 3235.52
get this like I I don't get what I get

3233.15 --> 3237.83
to see sometimes and when I say it it

3235.52 --> 3239.99
just rolls out and then afterward I have

3237.83 --> 3243.83
to look at it and think like whoa what

3239.99 --> 3246.0499999999997
just came out of there like it feels to

3243.83 --> 3248.12
me sometimes like I'm an Oracle or

3246.05 --> 3250.04
something and things just come out of me

3248.12 --> 3251.96
that are just beyond my own

3250.04 --> 3254.29
understanding and then I'm just going to

3251.96 --> 3257.93
have to work my way through that

3254.29 --> 3260.69
afterwards even how the entire giant

3257.93 --> 3264.0499999999997
vision experience pretty much is like

3260.69 --> 3266.06
that it just get no way to conceptualize

3264.05 --> 3269.3900000000003
or handle any of that right when I came

3266.06 --> 3273.48
out and now years and years later I'm

3269.39 --> 3275.46
still just comparing stuff

3273.48 --> 3281.4900000000002
and just seem like you know what really

3275.46 --> 3284.25
happened but but yeah now it's different

3281.49 --> 3287.1899999999996
because this is the internet this is not

3284.25 --> 3291.869
a person I'm talking to that I can size

3287.19 --> 3294.6
up it's potentially anyone that that

3291.869 --> 3295.3500000000004
moves over and clicks this for whatever

3294.6 --> 3298.74
reason

3295.35 --> 3302.72
so I can't just all throw it out there

3298.74 --> 3306.39
even talked about this before like yeah

3302.72 --> 3309.7799999999997
one to one I will tell you so much more

3306.39 --> 3311.73
because I think I could because I think

3309.78 --> 3313.59
it would not cause so much collateral

3311.73 --> 3317.16
damage and the person I would be talking

3313.59 --> 3319.02
to would get that and then also get why

3317.16 --> 3323.7599999999998
I won't talk about this in the open and

3319.02 --> 3326.46
there's many people I've heard enough

3323.76 --> 3330.3300000000004
experiences solely on other I've had

3326.46 --> 3331.7400000000002
enough experiences to realize that no

3330.33 --> 3333.84
all is what it seems

3331.74 --> 3336.39
so that extra dimensional stuff and all

3333.84 --> 3340.109
is such a possible layman offered some

3336.39 --> 3342.93
strange stuff happening me just things

3340.109 --> 3345.75
that look there's no explanation for oh

3342.93 --> 3348.0
well the less I'm cause I'm personally

3345.75 --> 3350.97
currently fascinated with the concept

3348.0 --> 3354.99
and not surprisingly considering my

3350.97 --> 3358.859
cosmogonic all theories the possibility

3354.99 --> 3362.97
of extra dimensional spaces that there's

3358.859 --> 3367.23
places that are through that still do

3362.97 --> 3369.6899999999996
exist to have a a physical function

3367.23 --> 3371.72
despite them not literally being in the

3369.69 --> 3375.18
normal 3d realm

3371.72 --> 3377.25
Ray Allen heals the Jew upon the

3375.18 --> 3379.859
jealousy are the result there was an

3377.25 --> 3382.65
episode of the original Star Trek right

3379.859 --> 3384.869
and it would I know it's funny but it's

3382.65 --> 3386.4300000000003
my friend uses that as our electrode

3384.869 --> 3388.56
because when I tell him about the

3386.43 --> 3390.359
conspiracy [ __ ] well was an episode of

3388.56 --> 3394.109
Star Trek he'll watch that and he shows

3390.359 --> 3396.84
me and is so relevant but anyway a saucy

3394.109 --> 3398.52
not the way Captain [ __ ] and stuff like

3396.84 --> 3401.1000000000004
that right the bizarre there was an

3398.52 --> 3403.2599999999998
episode we are being count of these

3401.1 --> 3406.2
extra dimensional beans but they were

3403.26 --> 3406.9900000000002
lame they moved that fast or they were

3406.2 --> 3409.99
that on

3406.99 --> 3412.39
and they were human and uphills they

3409.99 --> 3415.4199999999996
were that they moved that fast or the

3412.39 --> 3417.1299999999997
vibration was that fast he could you

3415.42 --> 3419.26
could stand in a cloud of people being

3417.13 --> 3421.57
one of the beams and nobody would be

3419.26 --> 3425.4700000000003
moving I would you know because you're

3421.57 --> 3427.42
you la you're moving that fast they saw

3425.47 --> 3429.73
so these people could stand there and

3427.42 --> 3430.36
only say that could be talking to you

3429.73 --> 3432.4
like that

3430.36 --> 3433.96
but yeah those are those are another

3432.4 --> 3436.15
being the sort of being that was

3433.96 --> 3438.67
standing here but I'd be like that I'd

3436.15 --> 3440.56
be spelled there is a real time

3438.67 --> 3443.41
dimension psyche episode not all right

3440.56 --> 3446.23
well Star Trek is riddled all series

3443.41 --> 3449.5299999999997
have episodes like that and there's even

3446.23 --> 3452.14
superheroes now like super speed and

3449.53 --> 3453.73
yeah yeah there's like mortals there was

3452.14 --> 3458.2599999999998
like mortals and stuff like that and

3453.73 --> 3460.57
about a society a commentary is societal

3458.26 --> 3462.28
for me too a commentary but the guy that

3460.57 --> 3465.1600000000003
wrote it like Gene Roddenberry oh well

3462.28 --> 3466.84
it was very untraced in there and it was

3465.16 --> 3468.3399999999997
just my frame did you say oh oh that's

3466.84 --> 3471.4
every - every time I mention something

3468.34 --> 3473.08
about a problem on your way what about

3471.4 --> 3475.84
governments just awful huh you could

3473.08 --> 3477.7599999999998
always oh I've got an episode because he

3475.84 --> 3480.19
knows every episode he's like a Star

3477.76 --> 3482.7900000000004
Trek he guy and it was just funny how he

3480.19 --> 3487.48
used that and he's short and I was I was

3482.79 --> 3493.35
I was just mimic in reality take nothing

3487.48 --> 3497.41
and are we you know all right look

3493.35 --> 3500.109
here's a serious parallel with galbi

3497.41 --> 3500.5899999999997
yeah by the way of hello reason thanks

3500.109 --> 3503.1
for joining

3500.59 --> 3507.28
well I really did but there is a

3503.1 --> 3512.14
definite parallel to yeah the concept of

3507.28 --> 3516.6090000000004
outer space and other worlds and the

3512.14 --> 3520.21
extra dimension and like many things

3516.609 --> 3523.81
themes things that happen situations in

3520.21 --> 3525.73
Star Trek are inspired on the

3523.81 --> 3529.21
hello-hello synergetic encounters

3525.73 --> 3530.7
basically and they're like trying to

3529.21 --> 3533.52
make sense of it shape it

3530.7 --> 3538.1899999999996
and then translating it into physical

3533.52 --> 3538.19
literalism based science fiction

3538.4 --> 3544.349
probably most of it probably definitely

3542.01 --> 3546.57
replicated life in somebody's arm enough

3544.349 --> 3549.51
like you know the guy gene Gordon but he

3546.57 --> 3552.57
was very sober right now real injured

3549.51 --> 3555.119
know them to love Star Trek again

3552.57 --> 3556.71
through my friend that just watch it a

3555.119 --> 3558.6600000000003
couple of episodes so every take my boot

3556.71 --> 3560.76
visor alright what have you gone for you

3558.66 --> 3562.47
and we would start talking and well then

3560.76 --> 3565.6400000000003
fight money Caesar I've got any episode

3562.47 --> 3568.5299999999997
and switch or not and the episode on

3565.64 --> 3571.109
Star Trek or something right yes so I'm

3568.53 --> 3574.38
meet you I've been following the the

3571.109 --> 3578.27
Voyager series I even bought it on

3574.38 --> 3581.31
reaching the inner special see DVD a

3578.27 --> 3584.28
complete collection case but it's not

3581.31 --> 3586.17
here it's my stash cuz takes up too much

3584.28 --> 3588.69
room it's really clunky when you can

3586.17 --> 3592.29
just go to Netflix and clicks neck next

3588.69 --> 3595.53
episode but I hate exactly but it it is

3592.29 --> 3599.64
amazing and there's so much stuff in

3595.53 --> 3603.0
there like so much it freaks me out at

3599.64 --> 3604.89
times now like when I'm getting it's

3603.0 --> 3606.569
almost like overwhelmed by all the

3604.89 --> 3609.72
synchronicities I just watch it it's

3606.569 --> 3612.96
like she says this reminds me so

3609.72 --> 3615.66
freaking much about certain elements of

3612.96 --> 3618.93
what I've experienced or information I'm

3615.66 --> 3620.3689999999997
getting through it just like ah this is

3618.93 --> 3623.2799999999997
story I love it's scary

3620.369 --> 3627.75
oh yeah sorry can I just push on that

3623.28 --> 3629.19
you said they you get something to be

3627.75 --> 3631.89
synchronous is they're really

3629.19 --> 3636.3
overwhelmed by synchronous yeah but what

3631.89 --> 3640.0499999999997
do you mean by overwhelmed well a basic

3636.3 --> 3641.849
synchronicity is very typical you do

3640.05 --> 3644.8100000000004
something or you talk about something

3641.849 --> 3648.29
and then right after

3644.81 --> 3651.44
a key component of what you talked about

3648.29 --> 3654.83
as a concept suddenly physically

3651.44 --> 3658.7000000000003
manifests naturally by accident somebody

3654.83 --> 3661.31
walks in with a t-shirt there are people

3658.7 --> 3663.89
like one day there was really weird like

3661.31 --> 3665.39
somebody a baller I didn't even remember

3663.89 --> 3668.54
who was was like playing with the

3665.39 --> 3670.16
Rubik's Cube then like a few hours after

3668.54 --> 3671.96
that I go to the coffee shop and

3670.16 --> 3675.6499999999996
somebody's playing with a freaking baby

3671.96 --> 3677.93
and it's like come on because yeah if

3675.65 --> 3679.64
that happens once it's like oh that's

3677.93 --> 3684.62
interesting it's interesting coincidence

3679.64 --> 3686.87
so what if every day 10 to 20 of these

3684.62 --> 3689.0899999999997
types of things all happen all at once

3686.87 --> 3691.94
simultaneously constantly and you're

3689.09 --> 3696.4100000000003
constantly like hit in the face all over

3691.94 --> 3699.53
more nicely well there's me no I not too

3696.41 --> 3702.98
much I'll rate rate scares me because I

3699.53 --> 3705.23
can feel I can if you could almost

3702.98 --> 3707.92
symbolically say I can feel the

3705.23 --> 3711.77
clockwork gnomes screwing around and

3707.92 --> 3713.75
it's it doesn't feel like it doesn't

3711.77 --> 3718.64
feel like it's amusement it almost feels

3713.75 --> 3723.68
like a hostility but I don't understand

3718.64 --> 3725.06
oh I kinda get it but and when I do we

3723.68 --> 3727.43
now have it like saying I'm nice to you

3725.06 --> 3729.65
like I just laughing so I think what you

3727.43 --> 3732.5
know it confirms to me that I'm right

3729.65 --> 3736.96
about the way certain things happen in

3732.5 --> 3740.42
life right so I syllable we talked about

3736.96 --> 3743.57
synchronicities 20 years and yeah it is

3740.42 --> 3748.1
amazing but when it starts to pile on

3743.57 --> 3750.4100000000003
more and more and more that's like well

3748.1 --> 3751.0099999999998
I'm not too much of a good thing becomes

3750.41 --> 3753.68
by it

3751.01 --> 3756.86
ah that's that right okay well you

3753.68 --> 3759.08
becoming overwhelming right now know

3756.86 --> 3761.3
what you think you don't deserve it or

3759.08 --> 3766.52
something like no it literally feels

3761.3 --> 3769.88
like an assault on me on my spirit too

3766.52 --> 3773.75
much information type assault

3769.88 --> 3779.28
right overwhelm literally overwhelmed

3773.75 --> 3781.74
too much it becomes an assault yeah

3779.28 --> 3784.53
that's not healthy last no it's not it's

3781.74 --> 3787.2299999999996
damn well not healthy but that's but did

3784.53 --> 3790.4100000000003
I mean that Santino that's something you

3787.23 --> 3794.03
may have to maybe I don't talk to people

3790.41 --> 3797.22
mean I I do and I have even on this show

3794.03 --> 3799.8300000000004
constantly when it happened like yeah a

3797.22 --> 3802.56
few weeks ago I was just knee-deep in

3799.83 --> 3805.23
this [ __ ] too much I literally said like

3802.56 --> 3807.6
I feel like I'm getting to the bottom of

3805.23 --> 3810.69
the swing of the pendulum and it's

3807.6 --> 3813.42
crushing me I feel like the entire

3810.69 --> 3816.21
freakin world is resting on my shoulders

3813.42 --> 3817.8
and it's crushing me that's how it

3816.21 --> 3820.53
you're lazy

3817.8 --> 3824.2200000000003
you like to be so in control of things

3820.53 --> 3828.48
and that kind of thing well you know my

3824.22 --> 3831.6299999999997
oversight depends on it it is looking

3828.48 --> 3833.52
through you got to understand also the

3831.63 --> 3838.9700000000003
things you actually don't want to

3833.52 --> 3843.24
understand it takes you away from a a

3838.97 --> 3845.99
confine human view if you try to

3843.24 --> 3848.7
understand everything throughout

3845.99 --> 3852.12
everything as a giant spectrum of

3848.7 --> 3855.12
reality it takes you away from a simple

3852.12 --> 3860.04
human form and that is disruptive it is

3855.12 --> 3864.21
kind of unhealthy to do that yeah it

3860.04 --> 3866.13
tears away at your spirit oh not mine

3864.21 --> 3869.88
you're certainly know eventually that's

3866.13 --> 3872.19
because you didn't go yeah that door no

3869.88 --> 3874.59
no it no I mean you're just that not

3872.19 --> 3876.36
that was that was just put any authority

3874.59 --> 3878.7000000000003
you can't say I have any experience what

3876.36 --> 3880.8
you've experienced but I could see a

3878.7 --> 3882.54
well you could but I could also see you

3880.8 --> 3884.55
have an experience what I love is that

3882.54 --> 3886.38
was going to be a very strange statement

3884.55 --> 3888.44
you know what I have and I can't prove

3886.38 --> 3891.82
it because you still have a lot of

3888.44 --> 3896.92
personified reactions to things

3891.82 --> 3898.9
and for me it's like sometimes it feels

3896.92 --> 3900.4
like I don't have that response anymore

3898.9 --> 3903.64
but I do understand it

3900.4 --> 3906.34
I do understand like why one side will

3903.64 --> 3911.71
be pissed off and how the other side is

3906.34 --> 3914.2000000000003
dealing with that so yeah it's there all

3911.71 --> 3917.23
right so you think the challah right I'm

3914.2 --> 3918.97
not a I'm not reacting in the right way

3917.23 --> 3923.02
or something wrong oh yeah no you are

3918.97 --> 3926.08
you're reacting in a human way I tend to

3923.02 --> 3928.42
react in a neutral way because I am

3926.08 --> 3930.7599999999998
trying above all to maintain oversight

3928.42 --> 3933.55
no but you don't they overwhelmed if you

3930.76 --> 3935.65
just told me this was it I know but

3933.55 --> 3939.46
that's just how it works

3935.65 --> 3941.23
it's for me great so so so good good

3939.46 --> 3943.75
good not with you I wouldn't have before

3941.23 --> 3947.53
were seen wouldn't it be better lame if

3943.75 --> 3950.65
you came back and started taking a human

3947.53 --> 3952.9300000000003
because I can assure you try as he I say

3950.65 --> 3955.42
LaBrie I celebrate synchronously and I

3952.93 --> 3957.8799999999997
see all the time I literally do I get I

3955.42 --> 3960.1
get honestly I get presented with job

3957.88 --> 3962.8900000000003
since I don't have to talk about are I

3960.1 --> 3963.94
fancy a fancy starting what and I know

3962.89 --> 3966.19
it's not a couple of days later

3963.94 --> 3966.73
someone's are you working on that's

3966.19 --> 3968.7400000000002
crazy

3966.73 --> 3971.56
but I celebrate I don't I don't

3968.74 --> 3974.74
overthink this because I'm sales no no I

3971.56 --> 3976.93
know those those things that on this or

3974.74 --> 3979.5099999999998
endless rail my whatever would be able

3976.93 --> 3982.39
to understand but I love everything

3979.51 --> 3985.5400000000004
about it I just as a celebrate a celebre

3982.39 --> 3987.64
all the synchronicities and you're

3985.54 --> 3991.0
seeing that's a natural human thing but

3987.64 --> 3993.2799999999997
most humans don't sport sports anchors

3991.0 --> 3995.35
nice easy don't even think of it because

3993.28 --> 3998.32
I'm not in tune way looking for it all

3995.35 --> 4001.25
right right you know so that's what you

3998.32 --> 4005.4300000000003
know so that's the normal the normal

4001.25 --> 4007.77
reaction is not to see or appreciate the

4005.43 --> 4010.5
model I do see a mic I can't not see

4007.77 --> 4013.95
them but yeah there's Ricky and I wake

4010.5 --> 4014.589
up too deep it feels like it drove me

4013.95 --> 4018.0989999999997
mad

4014.589 --> 4020.589
I am trying to like find a new balance

4018.099 --> 4022.6600000000003
it's fascinating are when I find it

4020.589 --> 4025.5389999999998
fascinating that you know you can you

4022.66 --> 4027.489
can actually manifest things you really

4025.539 --> 4029.17
can't do that I've done it I'd I don't

4027.489 --> 4031.21
know how many times I've done it just

4029.17 --> 4033.7290000000003
playfully not they I'm going to be rich

4031.21 --> 4036.579
because I never when you appear a

4033.729 --> 4038.89
request or if you pair a request you

4036.579 --> 4040.719
only get what you really need right

4038.89 --> 4043.3289999999997
that's why it gives it gives you that

4040.719 --> 4044.41
back right and as it's so true I've done

4043.329 --> 4047.259
it so many times

4044.41 --> 4049.719
played with karma and stuff like that I

4047.259 --> 4052.079
really have our experiment it's fun but

4049.719 --> 4055.15
since I was 16 I've been thinking liters

4052.079 --> 4058.319
17 I've been thinking all this I

4055.15 --> 4061.2690000000002
realized I've missed some really really

4058.319 --> 4063.069
people that seen ghosts and I had no

4061.269 --> 4064.8689999999997
reason it does believe in no friends are

4063.069 --> 4069.299
minding a describer and you know they

4064.869 --> 4076.859
would prove it to me by other people

4069.299 --> 4080.529
yeah stuff all over it I worked out like

4076.859 --> 4083.41
spectrum even of spirits and the worst

4080.529 --> 4088.299
and that was 20 years ago okay it's

4083.41 --> 4090.91
still my website no so well I've seen

4088.299 --> 4092.739
other except before no store I love if

4090.91 --> 4094.769
that's before subject twenty years on

4092.739 --> 4097.75
you right

4094.769 --> 4100.21
nearly but I doesn't matter if you're

4097.75 --> 4102.699
gay experience doesn't neatly smile be

4100.21 --> 4104.7390000000005
no that doesn't mean that you're smarter

4102.699 --> 4106.3589999999995
than anybody else it just means you've

4104.739 --> 4110.049
had more experience that so it doesn't

4106.359 --> 4112.389
mean you smile so I always play out a

4110.049 --> 4114.609
lesson to kids if they'll if they say

4112.389 --> 4115.54
something our war would you know I see

4114.609 --> 4117.219
oh okay okay

4115.54 --> 4119.7699999999995
I'll think about that or whatever

4117.219 --> 4122.17
there's I know for a fact that we gave

4119.77 --> 4124.330000000001
Dhamma as we get older you really doing

4122.17 --> 4127.27
get less that's connected orbit the

4124.33 --> 4130.929
majority they get disconnected from that

4127.27 --> 4134.319
child lay a curiosity a sense adventure

4130.929 --> 4137.139
and these amazing things because they

4134.319 --> 4140.56
can't communicate they love sin summary

4137.139 --> 4141.999
didn't people I know that they just go

4140.56 --> 4144.999000000001
out to

4141.999 --> 4148.989
they lose that rich actually feeds

4144.999 --> 4151.5689999999995
intelligence therapist without even

4148.989 --> 4155.049
knowing it because they do it they don't

4151.569 --> 4159.009
see to hide something and in doing so

4155.049 --> 4161.849
lose the inside literally yes yeah it's

4159.009 --> 4167.319
not logical it's a logical process of

4161.849 --> 4170.319
nihilism and ignorance as I used to get

4167.319 --> 4172.869000000001
by so that goes to the fact that message

4170.319 --> 4175.569
we are but I always tell me that that's

4172.869 --> 4178.3589999999995
why I believe we don't we have not

4175.569 --> 4183.639
actually what our minds right now not

4178.359 --> 4185.829000000001
really natural if left alone to find and

4183.639 --> 4187.779
discover we're getting dr. Neal it's go

4185.829 --> 4190.21
nuts oh I don't believe that this

4187.779 --> 4192.759
reality here is is quiet quiet

4190.21 --> 4194.199
well it should be because of the

4192.759 --> 4196.63
potential the mind we've been

4194.199 --> 4201.119
indoctrinated and so less as a result

4196.63 --> 4204.1900000000005
this world as a as a result of an

4201.119 --> 4209.139
education indoctrination that the well

4204.19 --> 4211.869
of the do these real you have two people

4209.139 --> 4214.84
that I believe we seem in be doing

4211.869 --> 4217.089999999999
something with us but well they but we'd

4214.84 --> 4219.219
already reduce everything and yeah and

4217.09 --> 4222.46
reap the benefits of the control that's

4219.219 --> 4225.4
their methodology yeah and that's what

4222.46 --> 4227.59
their bug tells you know and I that's

4225.4 --> 4229.78
what pisses me off island because when I

4227.59 --> 4233.05
look at kids I'm doing when I look at

4229.78 --> 4234.728999999999
that it's like you know for a fact like

4233.05 --> 4236.889
continue you know you see them feel life

4234.729 --> 4238.42
and you can say I can guarantee I'll see

4236.889 --> 4241.4490000000005
you in ten years in you're gonna be just

4238.42 --> 4244.15
totally buff like you can see the the

4241.449 --> 4245.86
marks their marks are life and it

4244.15 --> 4249.369
shouldn't be like now there's no reason

4245.86 --> 4251.768999999999
but they do it to us and and then like

4249.369 --> 4253.119
most parents won't propagate that on

4251.769 --> 4254.860000000001
turn our children you know what they

4253.119 --> 4257.499
have done just like that you know that's

4254.86 --> 4259.36
a book the safer abuse self-abuse

4257.499 --> 4262.179
basically as I saw that is what self

4259.36 --> 4263.679
abusing ourselves I think Bailey I'm

4262.179 --> 4267.249
gonna meet a cup of coffee Alvin and

4263.679 --> 4270.09
make someone else do talking Hector yup

4267.249 --> 4270.09
I'm still stood

4271.119 --> 4287.409
all right so anybody else alterator

4277.659 --> 4287.409
yeah sorry so you got anything to add on

4291.31 --> 4307.25
you know my new girl is looking into

4294.56 --> 4308.96
wicker so yeah yeah I thought I

4307.25 --> 4310.94
mentioned it because some of the things

4308.96 --> 4313.04
I see in your room and like where you

4310.94 --> 4319.0
where made me think maybe you're into

4313.04 --> 4322.73
something like that I think it's a nice

4319.0 --> 4323.929
girly way to hire thinking so I just

4322.73 --> 4331.959999999999
showed it to her see if she was

4323.929 --> 4331.96
interested no

4341.619 --> 4348.48
such a waste I can hear like a pulsing

4346.0 --> 4348.48
really low

4348.849 --> 4360.399
barely comes through you need a special

4352.419 --> 4367.51
microphone to get this anyway yeah

4360.399 --> 4369.909000000001
whicka I did get into that a bit just

4367.51 --> 4372.099
like always interested in just

4369.909 --> 4379.539
witchcraft paganism but made a bit

4372.099 --> 4384.849
modern all right I like looking old

4379.539 --> 4388.539
things well so did I but yeah I

4384.849 --> 4392.369000000001
eventually stopped yeah because I

4388.539 --> 4396.219
figured out that yeah again at the top

4392.369 --> 4399.848999999999
everything always turns out to be

4396.219 --> 4402.069
corrupt in some way yeah it's the same

4399.849 --> 4404.4890000000005
like Freemasonry it's the same thank you

4402.069 --> 4404.4890000000005
yeah

4405.089 --> 4410.979
so yeah but it's really interesting it

4408.01 --> 4413.889
has some interesting principles I do

4410.979 --> 4416.979
kind of like the the bottom culture of

4413.889 --> 4421.089
it it's yeah really naturalism in a way

4416.979 --> 4423.099
in a good way and yeah Freya and you

4421.089 --> 4424.659
like how they recognized that moonlight

4423.099 --> 4431.4890000000005
is cold that that's where I first

4424.659 --> 4431.489
thought ah yeah they'd up command

4433.96 --> 4440.02
all right I love to Sun yeah do you

4438.58 --> 4443.23
think they're like masculine feminine

4440.02 --> 4450.120000000001
sons like power and energy and strength

4443.23 --> 4450.12
the moons like mystery illusion and care

4450.87 --> 4459.04
hey if you wanna personify things and

4454.39 --> 4462.280000000001
yeah sure why not but I don't think it's

4459.04 --> 4466.24
really I think it's just our natural

4462.28 --> 4470.08
tendency to personify something and

4466.24 --> 4474.719999999999
basically deduce it to what it actually

4470.08 --> 4474.72
is which is beyond us

4479.5 --> 4486.52
it's you know it's an it's a method to

4483.57 --> 4489.49
to conceptualize and memorize things

4486.52 --> 4492.790000000001
it's a living tradition to do that and

4489.49 --> 4495.37
we're cars full of it I feel the same

4492.79 --> 4498.01
about God as well like yeah I can use

4495.37 --> 4500.92
personifications to help conceptualize

4498.01 --> 4506.71
and think about them but ultimately it's

4500.92 --> 4512.74
passed sonification right sonification

4506.71 --> 4517.54
is only a way to assist the individual

4512.74 --> 4520.51
mind to grasp it better because in

4517.54 --> 4524.4
reality it's a giant spectrum of

4520.51 --> 4527.530000000001
multi-dimensional stuff that's just

4524.4 --> 4532.0599999999995
beyond words beyond your beauty little

4527.53 --> 4535.48
minds including when you personify self

4532.06 --> 4537.13
and it's kind of like well making God in

4535.48 --> 4543.129999999999
man's image rather than the other way

4537.13 --> 4544.87
around yeah that's right but that's the

4543.13 --> 4548.35
reversal that's like the ying yang

4544.87 --> 4550.57
mirror affectionate we have to well I'm

4548.35 --> 4554.9800000000005
gonna do this to Ali when he's gone it's

4550.57 --> 4557.889999999999
the ego right it's the ego that makes it

4554.98 --> 4560.53
necessary in order for you to deal with

4557.89 --> 4564.43
it and make purpose of it to personify

4560.53 --> 4568.63
it subtly make it within your grasp

4564.43 --> 4569.17
it's the that does that polarizes when

4568.63 --> 4572.56
you get lost

4569.17 --> 4574.93
oh those dark paths well yeah if you're

4572.56 --> 4575.8
gonna deduce everything until there's

4574.93 --> 4579.070000000001
nothing left

4575.8 --> 4584.04
yeah then there is nothing left you are

4579.07 --> 4584.04
not thinking you're so ridiculous

4585.83 --> 4593.76
well I know it works like that Billy

4590.73 --> 4595.919999999999
Sunday chef what's up with your also

4593.76 --> 4600.6
molecular medicine why do you keep on

4595.92 --> 4602.78
spamming that I know about it I've heard

4600.6 --> 4602.780000000001
it

4606.219 --> 4614.2390000000005
what you're saying on race yeah I was

4611.0 --> 4616.579
just gonna agree if anything we can

4614.239 --> 4619.159
think of conceptualize or imagine that's

4616.579 --> 4621.018999999999
not God it's beyond anything we can

4619.159 --> 4622.67
imagine and if we imagine something

4621.019 --> 4625.25
that's still not it yeah

4622.67 --> 4626.75
and that's you know the closest thing we

4625.25 --> 4629.51
can understand going back to the Old

4626.75 --> 4633.739
Testament is God has God lives in

4629.51 --> 4636.619000000001
unapproachable light right I tried to

4633.739 --> 4640.549999999999
conceptualize it Eve with my ring yeah

4636.619 --> 4645.46
well that is one in the zero

4640.55 --> 4648.559
he is all things and outside of it all

4645.46 --> 4650.42
yeah yes but an image you know like

4648.559 --> 4652.909000000001
something like like the one trader said

4650.42 --> 4653.71
man in the image it's just it's just not

4652.909 --> 4658.489
right

4653.71 --> 4661.159
jesus said john 17:3 he wasn't God I

4658.489 --> 4663.32
like using all conceptions and then just

4661.159 --> 4665.9
using a bare creative license myself

4663.32 --> 4668.119
when I finger it the only reason I

4665.9 --> 4669.259999999999
joined the show Ellen is because dawn

4668.119 --> 4670.909
trailer said he has some questions

4669.26 --> 4673.969
regarding faith and if he joined the

4670.909 --> 4676.219
show I said I would join so oh yeah you

4673.969 --> 4677.86
didn't have George for a kid one time if

4676.219 --> 4680.449
we weren't taught about nothing else

4677.86 --> 4684.049999999999
that's my favorite topic as you know so

4680.449 --> 4686.15
yeah if you you know ask the questions

4684.05 --> 4688.719
you have and then I can jump off oh yeah

4686.15 --> 4691.19
if I one doesn't mind no sure go ahead I

4688.719 --> 4692.809
guess well I did he I did listen to you

4691.19 --> 4695.598999999999
yesterday I think it was quite a lot I

4692.809 --> 4696.889
wondered where it started and if your

4695.599 --> 4697.3
parents were religious and things like

4696.889 --> 4700.84
that

4697.3 --> 4703.13
no no complete opposite

4700.84 --> 4707.75
started like atheist and then move

4703.13 --> 4709.969
towards it I the first time someone asks

4707.75 --> 4712.28
being do I believe in God I pointed up

4709.969 --> 4714.559
to this guy and I said I don't believe

4712.28 --> 4716.42
exactly what it says in the book when I

4714.559 --> 4719.119000000001
said that I was referring to the Bible

4716.42 --> 4720.679
but I pointed out this is something that

4719.119 --> 4722.42
the it controls everything so there

4720.679 --> 4729.469
wasn't ever no time in my life where I

4722.42 --> 4731.4490000000005
was like an 80% over 2009 it just got it

4729.469 --> 4734.36
just got too much you know the the

4731.449 --> 4736.009999999999
synchronicities and and and the and the

4734.36 --> 4739.28
path directed to and

4736.01 --> 4741.83
just so many things and it began to to

4739.28 --> 4743.99
push me towards but how do you he come

4741.83 --> 4747.74
back to the book then was a specific

4743.99 --> 4751.19
person or something what made you go to

4747.74 --> 4753.679999999999
the book I was drawn to the message of

4751.19 --> 4757.3099999999995
faith itself the way that so many

4753.68 --> 4760.13
different cultures to so many gears you

4757.31 --> 4762.580000000001
know predating the Bible spoke of it so

4760.13 --> 4768.29
I always felt there was something bigger

4762.58 --> 4772.73
right right and so when I you know I

4768.29 --> 4774.46
finally found that they all connect they

4772.73 --> 4778.79
just kind of what blew me away you know

4774.46 --> 4782.36
yeah I say that I just I guess my

4778.79 --> 4786.56
question is why that one then which one

4782.36 --> 4790.94
why that but why the King James the King

4786.56 --> 4794.81
James is is is actually one one way to

4790.94 --> 4796.28
look at it but I think it's important

4794.81 --> 4799.43
when you look at what Jesus said and

4796.28 --> 4803.23
then you try to you try to correlate

4799.43 --> 4808.490000000001
that with with I guess two things

4803.23 --> 4811.07
reality and equality right so how can

4808.49 --> 4814.67
you have a chosen people over all people

4811.07 --> 4817.3099999999995
when all people were created equal yeah

4814.67 --> 4821.24
so that doesn't that didn't work out and

4817.31 --> 4822.8
then to realize that you know the Jewish

4821.24 --> 4825.5
actually said let us not hear the voice

4822.8 --> 4827.6
of our Lord again and that was granted

4825.5 --> 4830.69
to them they no longer became the

4827.6 --> 4834.52
messengers Jesus kind of against

4830.69 --> 4837.169999999999
religion was really not against the

4834.52 --> 4839.81
organized religion rights that's a big

4837.17 --> 4843.68
difference it's not religion it's about

4839.81 --> 4847.64
a church with a spiritual dictator

4843.68 --> 4850.4800000000005
basically yeah telling others religion

4847.64 --> 4853.97
should be sought from within not from

4850.48 --> 4856.129999999999
somebody telling you

4853.97 --> 4858.59
I guess what mostly interests me because

4856.13 --> 4862.1900000000005
I now have faith there is something that

4858.59 --> 4865.01
creates everything and natural law and

4862.19 --> 4867.889999999999
stuff moral right and wrong but I

4865.01 --> 4871.22
haven't put it into the category of the

4867.89 --> 4873.08
Christian God or I don't know I'm just

4871.22 --> 4875.4400000000005
looking at all conception so most

4873.08 --> 4876.62
questions are like why that and what

4875.44 --> 4878.12
isn't

4876.62 --> 4882.17
don't you think of it in other ways as

4878.12 --> 4884.3
well well I actually don't see that the

4882.17 --> 4887.03
message and the God in which I believe

4884.3 --> 4890.72
in is actually found completely in the

4887.03 --> 4892.46
Holy Bible right and so you might have

4890.72 --> 4895.13
heard me mention the Quran a few times

4892.46 --> 4897.86
now I'm not Muslim

4895.13 --> 4901.64
I have not taken the Shahada all right

4897.86 --> 4904.8099999999995
which means that I first become a Muslim

4901.64 --> 4908.6900000000005
you know like officially become a Muslim

4904.81 --> 4912.620000000001
however the reason they're not doing so

4908.69 --> 4917.389999999999
because I wish to give back more than I

4912.62 --> 4922.04
can do currently and so when I commit

4917.39 --> 4924.77
you know you know in my mind if if I was

4922.04 --> 4928.37
to seriously do it it would have to be

4924.77 --> 4931.400000000001
an absolute conviction and promise

4928.37 --> 4934.01
because um you know the the Quran

4931.4 --> 4936.95
teaches us if you don't know search I'm

4934.01 --> 4938.54
like analysis isn't it sounds like in

4936.95 --> 4942.8
you haven't chosen Christianity from

4938.54 --> 4944.39
like dogmatic specifics you just just

4942.8 --> 4946.6900000000005
related to that in general and chose

4944.39 --> 4949.43
that one like in this life of our

4946.69 --> 4954.73
understand like when two or three gather

4949.43 --> 4959.66
in my name there I am and so that can be

4954.73 --> 4960.53
anybody who has faith in the one god

4959.66 --> 4962.18
right

4960.53 --> 4965.8099999999995
the idea that the idea that God could

4962.18 --> 4968.17
create another God it's it's logical

4965.81 --> 4973.650000000001
right

4968.17 --> 4979.15
right so each for example for example

4973.65 --> 4983.08
here's the way I look at it we have the

4979.15 --> 4984.849999999999
different books available to us now but

4983.08 --> 4987.42
before Mohammed was only the Bible

4984.85 --> 4987.42
correct ah

4987.79 --> 4994.719
so everybody who perished before the

4990.25 --> 5000.15
Quran was created only had the Bible so

4994.719 --> 5003.06
therefore how could they know yes it was

5000.15 --> 5005.969
Abraham who actually first frustrated in

5003.06 --> 5010.830000000001
front before God which makes him Islamic

5005.969 --> 5014.1
when Jesus came he said I didn't come to

5010.83 --> 5016.83
change one jot or tittle from the law so

5014.1 --> 5019.77
he only came to enforce it he also said

5016.83 --> 5022.59
in John though in Matthew 15:24 I come

5019.77 --> 5024.21
unto only the lost sheep of Israel so he

5022.59 --> 5027.03
came to correct the law which they

5024.21 --> 5029.82
already had and when Mohammed came he

5027.03 --> 5034.469
gave up the book for everybody so

5029.82 --> 5036.36
despite despite what many say through

5034.469 --> 5040.89
the propaganda of the news and things

5036.36 --> 5043.889999999999
like that the the wisdom that the Quran

5040.89 --> 5049.08
holds along with the quality within its

5043.89 --> 5053.429
pages it makes you question your own

5049.08 --> 5055.83
reality oh how could this information be

5053.429 --> 5059.25
known and how could this information be

5055.83 --> 5061.59
here and so you know there's a lot of

5059.25 --> 5065.46
information in that booklet you know

5061.59 --> 5067.26
right they used it for example they used

5065.46 --> 5070.17
to think that Muhammad was crazy because

5067.26 --> 5073.679
he had a story of a conversation between

5070.17 --> 5075.39
two ants and one ant said get out of the

5073.679 --> 5077.13
way because Solomon's men are coming

5075.39 --> 5078.84
they'll crush you and they said I look

5077.13 --> 5080.7300000000005
he's absolutely nuts

5078.84 --> 5085.83
look he's talking about two ants talking

5080.73 --> 5089.15
right but in 2012 we discovered that

5085.83 --> 5089.15
ants have their own language

5089.19 --> 5096.599999999999
so it's now a totally plausible that

5093.81 --> 5100.29
they were talking and you know

5096.6 --> 5101.88
conversating you know have you heard of

5100.29 --> 5104.7
have you heard of the Pharaoh of the

5101.88 --> 5107.67
Bible who crossed you chase Moses across

5104.7 --> 5109.23
the Red Sea mmm a lot of the scriptures

5107.67 --> 5112.83
above my head I apologize

5109.23 --> 5115.86
yeah oh right no what okay so in the in

5112.83 --> 5118.59
the in the Bible it says you know Moses

5115.86 --> 5120.48
is that he is relaxed those that

5118.59 --> 5123.51
Egyptians that you see today you'll

5120.48 --> 5125.79
never see them again you know none of

5123.51 --> 5130.110000000001
them you see on them today you'll see

5125.79 --> 5134.49
again and if you just search in Google

5130.11 --> 5139.19
in Google Pharaoh in the Koran you'll

5134.49 --> 5144.12
find that we discovered a pharaoh

5139.19 --> 5145.679999999999
preserved in the in the ribs just down

5144.12 --> 5147.36
from the Red Sea where the crossing said

5145.68 --> 5149.84
to take place preserved in the most

5147.36 --> 5152.4
salty water to preserve the body

5149.84 --> 5154.53
thinking how long back that is quite

5152.4 --> 5157.98
impressive and in the Quran it says no

5154.53 --> 5159.36
for his for his you know for his actions

5157.98 --> 5160.08
we will make him an example for

5159.36 --> 5161.94
everybody

5160.08 --> 5163.95
they got that Pharaoh he's in the

5161.94 --> 5166.08
Alexandra Art Museum and every couple of

5163.95 --> 5170.639999999999
years he goes across the world on tour

5166.08 --> 5173.67
in the in the Torah of the Pharaohs who

5170.64 --> 5176.04
could have who could have known when our

5173.67 --> 5178.59
first mummy was discovered and eight now

5176.04 --> 5182.28
first Pharaoh discovered in 1855 ugly

5178.59 --> 5186.45
and already Naaman was already riding

5182.28 --> 5189.44
Pharaoh you are a Christian yeah that

5186.45 --> 5192.389999999999
respects the teachings of the Quran

5189.44 --> 5195.99
sorry you respect the teachings of the

5192.39 --> 5200.97
Quran as a Christian as I as a Christian

5195.99 --> 5203.58
I was as wise as a man who found faith

5200.97 --> 5205.59
through first Christianity because I

5203.58 --> 5207.9
guess it was English you know yeah yeah

5205.59 --> 5210.21
that's what I was gonna say earlier you

5207.9 --> 5212.91
know cool I mean you're out you know it

5210.21 --> 5215.7300000000005
sounds sounds 91 there's like because

5212.91 --> 5217.86
you caught on me you know you know you

5215.73 --> 5219.66
were not forsaken and I believe that and

5217.86 --> 5222.83
that's that's what I've been through

5219.66 --> 5225.95
but to be a Muslim you have to ask

5222.83 --> 5227.57
Jesus Christ above not above but along

5225.95 --> 5229.67
with all the prophets you have to you

5227.57 --> 5231.679999999999
know without believing and everything

5229.67 --> 5235.57
that came in the Bible you can't be a

5231.68 --> 5238.7300000000005
Muslim right on that that's not taught

5235.57 --> 5241.67
you know and each part of the Quran was

5238.73 --> 5245.03
revealed in context and so deeper

5241.67 --> 5248.03
insight is provided by every translation

5245.03 --> 5249.8
available today right cannot you can't

5248.03 --> 5252.139999999999

5375.3 --> 5380.219
it's about 250 pages 300 pages it's

5378.179 --> 5382.11
normal I believe I know a lot about

5380.219 --> 5384.119
Muhammad you know that was one of the

5382.11 --> 5385.589999999999
first thing that I discovered but I

5384.119 --> 5387.869
still Muhammad is the official

5385.59 --> 5390.84
biographer what was the official

5387.869 --> 5393.03
biography stamped by all the emails and

5390.84 --> 5396.4490000000005
stuff so good'd are worth 30 and

5393.03 --> 5400.38
tradition what was Muhammad position at

5396.449 --> 5402.089999999999
the time of the first revelation where

5400.38 --> 5404.1900000000005
it was a court held I want it oh no he

5402.09 --> 5406.769

5427.139 --> 5431.76
can't you can't worship the idols

5429.059 --> 5436.409000000001
anymore after he began to reveal the

5431.76 --> 5438.63
Quran the King offered him a place as

5436.409 --> 5441.739
king under the king if you just stopped

5438.63 --> 5444.2390000000005
doing it and he turned in the reply was

5441.739 --> 5446.428999999999
even if you had all the riches of the

5444.239 --> 5449.129999999999
whole world twice and gave it to me I

5446.429 --> 5451.019
would not stop what I'm doing yeah but

5449.13 --> 5452.55
no it used to run a boat he used to run

5451.019 --> 5455.459
about sorry I think cuz this really

5452.55 --> 5458.6990000000005
knocks me you used to run a boat lay

5455.459 --> 5462.329
siege to a village is starve them out

5458.699 --> 5465.388999999999
then go and kill every male up to a

5462.329 --> 5466.429
certain age and then take the woman is

5465.389 --> 5468.1990000000005
slaves

5466.429 --> 5471.5
I mean this is fine unless it's a store

5468.199 --> 5473.629999999999
this man Muhammad called it is on earth

5471.5 --> 5475.94
to Jeremy the Darwin Darwin read the

5473.63 --> 5478.46
back code the sealed necklaces official

5475.94 --> 5480.44
story by the Muslim world dances

5478.46 --> 5482.9890000000005
official story co-leader and we'll have

5480.44 --> 5485.839999999999
a quiz it's a very untraceable variant

5482.989 --> 5488.209999999999
traced all right well and look it is

5485.84 --> 5491.3
very nice yeah I know I know

5488.21 --> 5495.79
fine fine okay you know here I come with

5491.3 --> 5499.219
my interpretation and say everything

5495.79 --> 5501.62
everything all books all religions all

5499.219 --> 5506.06
cultures have all been tainted by

5501.62 --> 5509.0
darkness and the darkness will gather

5506.06 --> 5513.14
where the power is and they will put

5509.0 --> 5515.51
their stamps on the darkness so just

5513.14 --> 5518.38
because all the Imams agree to it why do

5515.51 --> 5524.0
they agree to that do they do that to

5518.38 --> 5526.37
reinforce a power basically because that

5524.0 --> 5529.219
is what they want they want when they

5526.37 --> 5532.3099999999995
are the organized religion they are

5529.219 --> 5534.7390000000005
fanatical in their methodology and they

5532.31 --> 5538.429
want control and that is the Empire of

5534.739 --> 5542.03
the Islamic state all that stuff but

5538.429 --> 5547.84
what is that actually to the original

5542.03 --> 5550.719
experience of Mohammed that is my point

5547.84 --> 5556.81
probably the slave strain don't like

5550.719 --> 5560.6
Islamic state but I respect the amazing

5556.81 --> 5563.6900000000005
revelation also yeah of what happened

5560.6 --> 5565.46
there the message of German biased

5563.69 --> 5567.049999999999
fruits that's why I see judge a man by

5565.46 --> 5569.84
his fruits and if you couldn't read that

5567.05 --> 5573.820000000001
the his life is basically surface that

5569.84 --> 5576.5
is for us that is for us now and here

5573.82 --> 5580.849999999999
you know you could say that about

5576.5 --> 5582.86
everyone you know everybody's gonna come

5580.85 --> 5586.96
from a dark place or

5582.86 --> 5590.389
make terrible mistakes or although yeah

5586.96 --> 5593.96
with Jesus I think that maybe the one

5590.389 --> 5596.06
exception Who am I to say even I just

5593.96 --> 5599.659
know that every time I get confronted

5596.06 --> 5604.25
about anything about him is that it just

5599.659 --> 5607.28
seems clear that it's about the path

5604.25 --> 5610.75
it's about the principle and the method

5607.28 --> 5613.58
and do it trying to do it right and

5610.75 --> 5616.07
that's what's that about really for me

5613.58 --> 5621.199
because everything else that surrounded

5616.07 --> 5623.659
that my god it's just but the script bag

5621.199 --> 5625.25
means like who use those dark in those

5623.659 --> 5627.199
light as the same in the Quran is I'm

5625.25 --> 5629.449
not seeing the whole Quran but as I see

5627.199 --> 5631.909
it it's all what you say then this like

5629.449 --> 5634.58
reality like to mix the truth with a

5631.909 --> 5636.379999999999
lies to keep us in a confused state and

5634.58 --> 5639.23
that's that

5636.38 --> 5643.01
or that is what controllers do they take

5639.23 --> 5645.549999999999
a corner within the light and then they

5643.01 --> 5648.860000000001
build an empire on top of that light

5645.55 --> 5655.6990000000005
covered in darkness yeah I'll go with ah

5648.86 --> 5658.699
that's a nice analogy later on doesn't

5655.699 --> 5661.4
mean that that light's not real just

5658.699 --> 5663.409
means that that's what happens that's

5661.4 --> 5666.949
what happens when a new religion pops up

5663.409 --> 5669.08
controllers come in they take over yeah

5666.949 --> 5673.549999999999
they take over and they make an empire

5669.08 --> 5677.55
out of it out of something that is the

5673.55 --> 5681.360000000001
exact opposite of an empire basically

5677.55 --> 5684.21
or even coming into being to counter

5681.36 --> 5687.929999999999
Empire because that is how Jesus came

5684.21 --> 5691.89
into the counter the Empire and every

5687.93 --> 5696.18
time it's God manifests something

5691.89 --> 5700.05
miraculous miraculous messages to

5696.18 --> 5702.18
counter the empire it's every time every

5700.05 --> 5708.0
every every every everything actually

5702.18 --> 5711.780000000001
yeah then do you know and then the

5708.0 --> 5717.66
message is taken and becomes a new

5711.78 --> 5721.16
empire yeah Jesus and Muhammad and

5717.66 --> 5721.16
conquer that Empire

5722.24 --> 5729.87
do you guys know when Muhammad was

5724.59 --> 5735.93
prophesized what by who by whom

5729.87 --> 5738.39
in the Bible he's not in the Bible he's

5735.93 --> 5740.34
prophesized in the Bible all right can

5738.39 --> 5744.13
you what lighting is up there he came

5740.34 --> 5747.169
from as I yeah

5744.13 --> 5747.169
[Music]

5747.59 --> 5751.45
now pop was what did what did he see

5749.66 --> 5753.349999999999
have you got the lane handy with your

5751.45 --> 5760.54
and it's not easy

5753.35 --> 5760.54
yep give me a moment yep

5760.66 --> 5771.099999999999
Missy Alton also the mountain in which

5764.93 --> 5777.320000000001
it was which he was given the revelation

5771.1 --> 5782.030000000001
right he was called he was big he was

5777.32 --> 5787.24
called you know a slave and servant by

5782.03 --> 5791.929999999999
God in the Quran right no Jesus no

5787.24 --> 5795.44
Mohammed all right in the Quran right so

5791.93 --> 5797.84
stats would behold my servant whom I

5795.44 --> 5798.44
uphold mine elect in whom my soul

5797.84 --> 5801.43
delights

5798.44 --> 5804.2
that's what Muhammad translates to I

5801.43 --> 5807.02
have put my spirit upon him he shall

5804.2 --> 5809.599999999999
bring forth judgment to the Gentiles so

5807.02 --> 5811.31
right there it's telling you that he's

5809.6 --> 5813.110000000001
giving a message that Jesus didn't come

5811.31 --> 5816.77
to bring because remember in Matthew

5813.11 --> 5825.599999999999
15:24 he said I come on only to the lost

5816.77 --> 5828.659000000001
sheep of Israel then later on it says

5825.6 --> 5828.659000000001
[Music]

5830.539 --> 5833.9
it says

5834.409 --> 5840.5599999999995
lit the wilderness and the cities see

5838.67 --> 5843.159
now this is the bad translations they're

5840.56 --> 5846.139
gonna give it different translations but

5843.159 --> 5848.78
they advise rate the prophecies were

5846.139 --> 5850.34
made the earth hojun here all day we

5848.78 --> 5852.679
might how'd you not know five hundred

5850.34 --> 5856.07
years later after a place was crucified

5852.679 --> 5858.35
a horror me years Obama yeah then it

5856.07 --> 5860.54
goes why don't we why do we see this is

5858.35 --> 5863.06
what that means and and it's it's

5860.54 --> 5864.86
Mohammed and he's he's the go heaven I

5863.06 --> 5867.02
sleep in the ceiling however and then

5864.86 --> 5869.449
Peck having said that's what the Bible

5867.02 --> 5872.0
was talking about this is this is the

5869.449 --> 5874.969
person that's a good that's a good

5872.0 --> 5877.79
theory Ali except for the claim that

5874.969 --> 5881.15
Mohammed copied the Bible is refuted

5877.79 --> 5883.84
because in the in the Bible it says a

5881.15 --> 5884.989
story about a pharaoh a pharaoh and a

5883.84 --> 5887.389
pharaoh

5884.989 --> 5891.169999999999
but in reality it was a pharaoh a

5887.389 --> 5893.9490000000005
pharaoh and a king and in the quran it's

5891.17 --> 5898.37
his Pharaoh Pharaoh and King and

5893.949 --> 5899.629999999999
therefore what he was copying the Bible

5898.37 --> 5901.429
and when he got to the point he didn't

5899.63 --> 5903.86
realize and then he just changed it to

5901.429 --> 5905.389
make it correct no I'm not having no it

5903.86 --> 5907.19
hadn't remain but I just thought I just

5905.389 --> 5910.28
made a statement the other is that has

5907.19 --> 5913.909
his wife's uncle translated his dreams

5910.28 --> 5915.469
and told you what they mean so it's not

5913.909 --> 5918.199
heaven it's not Mohammed that was in

5915.469 --> 5920.9
control and sport he he took was and as

5918.199 --> 5923.15
always our previous but it doesn't does

5920.9 --> 5925.58
it really matter Ali does it really

5923.15 --> 5929.299999999999
really matter what somebody else told

5925.58 --> 5932.179
him isn't it about the dream itself not

5929.3 --> 5934.46
somebody's interpretation of it yep

5932.179 --> 5937.31
great were the guys interpretation yeah

5934.46 --> 5939.08
but that's his problem he was exactly so

5937.31 --> 5941.830000000001
and that's my point that's not about

5939.08 --> 5941.83
that it's about
