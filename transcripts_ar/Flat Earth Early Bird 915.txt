yeah today the weather's

85.68 --> 89.60000000000001
changed around

87.28 --> 90.96000000000001
it's actually kind of a cool day all of

89.6 --> 93.52
a sudden

90.96 --> 96.0
it started raining

93.52 --> 98.56
just very slightly

96.0 --> 100.96
yesterday evening

98.56 --> 103.2
and fogged up kind of like this and it

100.96 --> 105.67999999999999
stayed this way

103.2 --> 108.399
so yeah the temperature is

105.68 --> 112.36000000000001
significantly lower

108.399 --> 112.36
let me google it

114.0 --> 120.159
yeah it's 18 degrees celsius right now

117.439 --> 120.15899999999999
so yeah that's

120.719 --> 124.64
went down six degrees

122.799 --> 126.71900000000001
but it's kind of nice

124.64 --> 128.479
have a bit of a change and yeah there's

126.719 --> 131.759
a lot of moist around and that i don't

128.479 --> 131.75900000000001
think the plants will mind

136.0 --> 140.08
it's just gonna get greener and greener

141.36 --> 143.61
right

142.72 --> 145.04
so

143.61 --> 147.20000000000002
[Music]

145.04 --> 149.44
but yeah

147.2 --> 151.51899999999998
a lot of people are not going to be

149.44 --> 155.0
going out

151.519 --> 155.0
with this weather

156.08 --> 158.4
so

158.64 --> 161.04
it's

161.76 --> 167.92
5th

162.64 --> 170.55999999999997
of june saturday 5th of june 2021

167.92 --> 172.48
hello nathan oakley first in chat adam

170.56 --> 175.92000000000002
meekin

172.48 --> 179.72
good servant good to see you thanks for

175.92 --> 179.72
sharing nathan oakley

186.8 --> 192.0
ah beautiful blue skies over there okay

189.04 --> 192.0
so no uh

197.36 --> 202.56
no wet spot hitting

200.08 --> 204.87900000000002
england just yet

202.56 --> 207.44
although i suspected you'll probably get

204.879 --> 209.44
it somewhere later in the day as well

207.44 --> 211.35999999999999
or tomorrow

209.44 --> 212.879
it usually does you know

211.36 --> 214.72000000000003
when either

212.879 --> 217.76
side

214.72 --> 221.2
because england and

217.76 --> 223.12
the netherlands are basically right

221.2 --> 225.04
across one another

223.12 --> 227.20000000000002
with an ocean in between and because of

225.04 --> 230.879
that every time some kind of weather

227.2 --> 234.159
hits over here it usually also hits

230.879 --> 234.159
in in england

236.159 --> 242.56
and the other way around

238.72 --> 242.56
sometimes it's just synchronous

249.04 --> 254.07999999999998
20 celsius

251.439 --> 257.12
that's a really good temperature a nice

254.08 --> 258.479
blue sky lovely

257.12 --> 260.23900000000003
yeah

258.479 --> 263.12
well i expect

260.239 --> 265.52
that sort of weather to to probably get

263.12 --> 267.12
back in a couple of days maybe tomorrow

265.52 --> 270.0
already we'll see

267.12 --> 274.639
but i'm fine with it

270.0 --> 274.639
it's nice to not feel so sweaty

275.44 --> 279.12
for a change

276.88 --> 282.32
because it really gets very hot

279.12 --> 284.16
specifically in here in the afternoon

282.32 --> 285.919
when it's warm outside

284.16 --> 288.16
because of the sun

285.919 --> 288.15999999999997
right

289.44 --> 295.16
hello

290.8 --> 295.16
juice h man

299.68 --> 303.68
all right so it's been a very quiet week

303.759 --> 310.12
because of all the missing flat earth

306.16 --> 310.12
debate live shows

310.32 --> 313.59999999999997
getting restless nathan

314.479 --> 319.12
you know we all live for your scraps

322.72 --> 327.199
it's not enough live globers being torn

325.28 --> 329.52
apart

327.199 --> 329.52000000000004
you know

329.6 --> 334.91900000000004
you can't deprive us from that for too

331.919 --> 334.919
long

340.479 --> 345.15999999999997
you're on the mend ah that's good to

342.16 --> 345.16
hear

358.0 --> 364.759
yeah my situation my jaws pretty much

360.8 --> 364.759
seem to have fully restored

368.24 --> 372.72
yeah

369.6 --> 374.08000000000004
it's a bit weird because

372.72 --> 376.16
things

374.08 --> 377.28
are really now back into a rested

376.16 --> 379.12
position

377.28 --> 383.75899999999996
but it's slightly different i think one

379.12 --> 386.24
of like the troublesome molar

383.759 --> 388.8
it's it's back like

386.24 --> 391.84000000000003
they're thankfully the nerve has not

388.8 --> 394.319
like been cut off or anything

391.84 --> 396.15999999999997
like yeah sometimes i fear that like oh

394.319 --> 397.68
inflammation isn't hitting the nerve

396.16 --> 400.96000000000004
this time which would mean that

397.68 --> 400.96
basically it would die

401.12 --> 404.8
you never really know but it's fully

402.72 --> 407.8
back but it seemed to have gone down a

404.8 --> 407.8
little

408.0 --> 410.88
a bit weird

411.199 --> 415.68
zero painkillers today oh that's that's

413.28 --> 417.919
great nathan

415.68 --> 420.56
i haven't had any painkillers

417.919 --> 423.35999999999996
although to be fair like when was it

420.56 --> 424.88
four days ago

423.36 --> 426.08000000000004
right

424.88 --> 429.28
for

426.08 --> 431.52
monday or sunday

429.28 --> 433.599
that's more than four days ago

431.52 --> 435.28
i did have half

433.599 --> 437.56
like uh

435.28 --> 440.0
not aspiring the other one

437.56 --> 441.52
paracetamol i don't know what what that

440.0 --> 444.479
is called

441.52 --> 446.15999999999997
in english but i had one of those

444.479 --> 450.12
now then you know it's bad when i

446.16 --> 450.12
actually take one of those

450.319 --> 456.8
sometimes i think it's more for placebo

453.039 --> 456.8
didn't really do all that much

459.039 --> 465.08
but other than that none i don't really

461.52 --> 465.08
take any painkillers

466.0 --> 471.039
[Music]

467.919 --> 474.039
see what you call it over there

471.039 --> 474.039
acetaminophen

476.84 --> 484.31899999999996
what acetaminophen

480.639 --> 484.319
wow okay i'll talk about

484.479 --> 487.35999999999996
different word

489.759 --> 492.8
i don't know if i'm gonna be able to

491.44 --> 495.759
remember that

492.8 --> 497.52000000000004
that is totally different

495.759 --> 500.319
but that's it

497.52 --> 502.15999999999997
it's a very old-fashioned thing

500.319 --> 504.47900000000004
with the known problem if you take too

502.16 --> 507.91900000000004
much of them at the same time you could

504.479 --> 510.0
literally make your liver fail and [ __ ]

507.919 --> 511.919
so

510.0 --> 513.12
that was the main problem with that why

511.919 --> 516.64
never

513.12 --> 519.9590000000001
take more than two never like done that

516.64 --> 519.959
but anyway

523.519 --> 526.88
right

525.04 --> 529.4399999999999
well you don't really

526.88 --> 531.12
see people use that word all that often

529.44 --> 534.6
it's the first time i'm ever reading

531.12 --> 534.6
about it so

534.8 --> 541.12
it's super basic it's unprescribed

538.88 --> 545.2
i still have it around but it's really

541.12 --> 548.36
more of a placebo painkiller

545.2 --> 548.36
to me

551.44 --> 553.7600000000001
uh

556.72 --> 560.88
well it is an aspirin

558.88 --> 563.4399999999999
i don't have aspirins

560.88 --> 567.16
aspirin would probably

563.44 --> 567.1600000000001
do better even

576.16 --> 582.88
yeah i remember aspiring so bitter

579.81 --> 582.88
[Music]

584.0 --> 588.68
tylenol i don't know what that is

601.279 --> 606.959
oh

603.44 --> 606.9590000000001
oh that's another word for it

607.76 --> 613.2
yeah tylenol paracetamol

611.32 --> 615.839
acetaminophen

613.2 --> 618.48
huh okay well i have heard you people

615.839 --> 620.0790000000001
use the word tylenol before so that'll

618.48 --> 622.8000000000001
stick better

620.079 --> 626.2399999999999
right it's called tylenol

622.8 --> 629.04
don't know why my google search didn't

626.24 --> 629.04
bring that up

629.36 --> 632.48
anyway thanks for informing me about

631.279 --> 634.64
that

632.48 --> 636.32
that's the brand name

634.64 --> 640.68
okay

636.32 --> 640.6800000000001
okay so it's the brand name right

646.079 --> 649.92
willow bark

647.519 --> 651.519
right it has natural

649.92 --> 655.1999999999999
uh

651.519 --> 658.079
aspirin in it that's correct hm

655.2 --> 658.0790000000001
i learned that too

659.2 --> 662.6400000000001
because we had like a

660.959 --> 664.56
a willow

662.64 --> 666.3199999999999
a really big one

664.56 --> 668.7199999999999
in our backyard

666.32 --> 670.48
over at my mom's house

668.72 --> 673.48
and sometimes they would do stuff with

670.48 --> 673.48
it

680.64 --> 684.3199999999999
and we had a bunny

683.12 --> 687.279
and he

684.32 --> 689.279
really liked chewing on it so he may

687.279 --> 690.32
have been a little bit of an aspirin

689.279 --> 692.079
addict

690.32 --> 693.2
so it's very important not to give him

692.079 --> 694.959
too much

693.2 --> 698.399
because

694.959 --> 698.399
then they would get the [ __ ]

699.68 --> 703.0
old days

706.0 --> 710.88
willow bark yeah are the leaves leaves

708.8 --> 714.4399999999999
has some aspirin

710.88 --> 714.4399999999999
in it as well

717.839 --> 722.5600000000001
hello by the way here we go again and

719.6 --> 722.5600000000001
george sanford

723.12 --> 729.9590000000001
and win the show

725.92 --> 729.959
what is the show topic

731.44 --> 735.2
well started out with the weather as

733.44 --> 737.9200000000001
usual

735.2 --> 740.32
then started talking about

737.92 --> 742.56
painkiller medication since nathan has

740.32 --> 746.399
just been off them because of his

742.56 --> 746.399
situation and i myself

746.72 --> 753.2
have had my own situation

749.839 --> 755.44
so that that's the topic so far

753.2 --> 757.2
those are the topics

755.44 --> 759.839
but hey i'm pretty much open for

757.2 --> 759.839
anything

770.079 --> 774.2399999999999
right i don't know is yeah it's

771.76 --> 776.24
different it's a different substance

774.24 --> 778.48
adam you can i know thank you

776.24 --> 778.48
sir

778.56 --> 781.959
mr expert

789.279 --> 792.639
all right so i got a

794.8 --> 799.519
a stupid letter yesterday

797.6 --> 802.8000000000001
i haven't even opened it because i'm

799.519 --> 802.8
kind of still like

803.68 --> 808.4799999999999
just calming down because it pisses me

806.24 --> 809.67
off

808.48 --> 811.04
because i find it

809.67 --> 812.959
[Music]

811.04 --> 816.639
bravely insulting

812.959 --> 818.959
i got a freaking letter from

816.639 --> 821.36
government i guess

818.959 --> 822.7199999999999
it's an invitation to get my corona

821.36 --> 824.32
vaccine

822.72 --> 826.8000000000001
oh thanks

824.32 --> 830.639
thanks so much

826.8 --> 830.639
but i think i'll decline

831.04 --> 835.36
and i'm gonna open up this letter later

837.68 --> 841.959
and just see what that's about

846.8 --> 850.7199999999999
i thought i was completely off their

848.639 --> 853.199
radar but apparently they still thought

850.72 --> 855.519
it was worth an attempt or something

853.199 --> 857.76
maybe they sized me up for their model

855.519 --> 859.44
that i might be just scared enough to go

857.76 --> 861.6
with it

859.44 --> 864.0790000000001
or they just really have no idea what to

861.6 --> 864.0790000000001
make of me

865.199 --> 870.639
and they don't know

868.32 --> 875.1600000000001
what i do because they don't follow my

870.639 --> 875.16
show because i talk about flat earth

886.48 --> 892.32
what happened with the research invested

890.399 --> 895.839
into charitaria

892.32 --> 900.8000000000001
and the what's going on with that well

895.839 --> 900.8000000000001
you'd have to check out martin litke

900.88 --> 905.76
or rather like the circles that he hangs

903.76 --> 908.0
with and he does research with because

905.76 --> 911.519
he has a lot of people

908.0 --> 914.56
that also do videos i think

911.519 --> 916.8
as for myself i kind of stuck to martin

914.56 --> 918.6389999999999
luther i just subscribed to a couple of

916.8 --> 922.16
different people though that have like

918.639 --> 924.48
tartaria related or

922.16 --> 927.8389999999999
are about monoliths

924.48 --> 927.839
ancient buildings

935.6 --> 941.12
but yeah what's

937.68 --> 943.04
there something specific that happened

941.12 --> 945.6
that's noteworthy

943.04 --> 948.0
when the show

945.6 --> 950.0790000000001
did you want to bring up something

948.0 --> 953.199
hello nathan r by the way

950.079 --> 954.6389999999999
good to see you in chat

953.199 --> 957.92
ah you're home

954.639 --> 957.92
good servant you made it

959.839 --> 964.48
yeah that's great to hear man i thought

962.0 --> 966.639
you were never gonna go back so many

964.48 --> 971.8000000000001
times it's been postponed but it's

966.639 --> 971.8
really great that you made it after all

1000.0 --> 1004.639
right

1001.68 --> 1006.2399999999999
so are you like cleaning off the dust

1004.639 --> 1008.0790000000001
because you've been away for a while

1006.24 --> 1010.24
right

1008.079 --> 1011.4399999999999
i'd probably start out doing a big

1010.24 --> 1014.0790000000001
cleanup

1011.44 --> 1014.0790000000001
of everything

1018.24 --> 1022.519
72 days sheesh

1033.12 --> 1036.12
so

1047.679 --> 1053.72
any advice for sick cats

1050.72 --> 1053.72
uh

1055.6 --> 1061.1999999999998
oh what is he sick of might be just fur

1058.24 --> 1063.1200000000001
balls right you gotta realize cats lick

1061.2 --> 1066.72
their own fur

1063.12 --> 1069.1999999999998
and they actually swallow it too so when

1066.72 --> 1072.799
they fur a lot like when they change

1069.2 --> 1075.919
coat which typically happens

1072.799 --> 1075.9189999999999
during springtime

1076.24 --> 1080.559
and during autumn

1078.08 --> 1083.6789999999999
then they have more fur

1080.559 --> 1086.3999999999999
and sometimes then they get sick of it

1083.679 --> 1088.4
you know and most cats just like they

1086.4 --> 1091.2800000000002
have it fully under control so they'll

1088.4 --> 1093.3600000000001
just go somewhere and just quickly barf

1091.28 --> 1095.2
out for a ball

1093.36 --> 1096.4799999999998
but for others they have more trouble

1095.2 --> 1099.1200000000001
with it

1096.48 --> 1102.6
what herpes yeah

1099.12 --> 1102.6
what the hell

1110.32 --> 1115.28
never heard of that

1112.88 --> 1115.2800000000002
kathy

1115.44 --> 1120.76
how does that even work

1117.76 --> 1120.76
weird

1129.36 --> 1134.9189999999999
it's very common i've never seen a cat

1131.76 --> 1134.919
with that

1139.36 --> 1144.7199999999998
he was faxed against it oh

1142.16 --> 1147.039
right

1144.72 --> 1147.039
what

1149.2 --> 1156.799
that's that doesn't make any sense

1152.559 --> 1156.799
how can you be vexed against that

1161.28 --> 1165.12
it's

1162.08 --> 1167.36
a virus right it's well it's a weird

1165.12 --> 1167.36
little

1168.0 --> 1173.36
like really bizarre

1170.799 --> 1175.6
elusive parasite

1173.36 --> 1177.6
so it's been deemed a virus because it's

1175.6 --> 1180.7199999999998
just really elusive it's

1177.6 --> 1182.799
it's it's weird how it works

1180.72 --> 1185.52
but it's like very active because of

1182.799 --> 1187.36
psychosomatics as well it's weird

1185.52 --> 1188.72
and typically comes out when there's a

1187.36 --> 1191.6789999999999
lot of hormones

1188.72 --> 1193.919
pouring through you like in spring

1191.679 --> 1196.0
when you would typically want to engage

1193.919 --> 1198.24
in sexual activities

1196.0 --> 1199.6
that it's like really a nuisance like

1198.24 --> 1202.08
that

1199.6 --> 1204.48
but how can you get vaccinated again

1202.08 --> 1207.48
that's already like

1204.48 --> 1207.48
low

1208.0 --> 1213.0
how can you get vaccinated against that

1220.08 --> 1223.28
how does that even work

1226.48 --> 1231.88
okay agm be careful with the caps

1245.84 --> 1250.6399999999999
oh well here we go that sounds like a

1248.159 --> 1252.7990000000002
familiar story

1250.64 --> 1252.7990000000002
but

1253.76 --> 1256.48
like

1255.12 --> 1259.12
hello

1256.48 --> 1263.559
he's got it now

1259.12 --> 1263.559
after he got faxed so

1272.4 --> 1279.2
boosters every year

1276.48 --> 1279.2
what the hell

1283.919 --> 1286.159
so

1287.36 --> 1292.1589999999999
exactly

1288.64 --> 1292.159
why did you agree to this

1292.72 --> 1297.039
i don't know man this sounds a lot like

1294.72 --> 1299.84
oh yeah if you want to have your kid go

1297.039 --> 1302.32
to this school it has to be corona facts

1299.84 --> 1305.84
or something like oh yeah

1302.32 --> 1309.039
oh that's great for the kid

1305.84 --> 1313.32
no it isn't don't do that

1309.039 --> 1313.32
just do homeschooling or something

1323.12 --> 1326.12
so

1332.159 --> 1335.3600000000001
my other cats never got and he and they

1334.559 --> 1337.76
got

1335.36 --> 1339.1999999999998
those booster shots and all the faxes

1337.76 --> 1340.72
against it

1339.2 --> 1344.28
as well

1340.72 --> 1344.28
here we go again

1353.919 --> 1358.8400000000001
right okay

1356.559 --> 1363.039
well then it's what i

1358.84 --> 1363.039
expected it's not a vax

1363.76 --> 1369.36
it basically just

1366.72 --> 1370.24
lures out the disease and gives it to

1369.36 --> 1371.84
them

1370.24 --> 1375.24
if they're vulnerable

1371.84 --> 1375.24
this is ridiculous

1375.36 --> 1379.12
this doesn't really sounds like an

1377.28 --> 1383.799
actual vaccine

1379.12 --> 1383.799
by classical standards at all

1399.2 --> 1403.24
hello gary with manga

1414.46 --> 1418.39
[Music]

1419.36 --> 1423.36
antibiotic

1420.96 --> 1423.3600000000001
why

1423.52 --> 1429.24
that can't help

1425.279 --> 1429.24
that makes no sense

1430.0 --> 1434.24
antibiotics don't work on that

1436.24 --> 1439.2
that's ridiculous

1441.679 --> 1446.88
oh for the infection in his eye oh he is

1444.24 --> 1446.88
that as well

1447.84 --> 1452.559
right so that that does sound then like

1450.4 --> 1452.5590000000002
a

1452.799 --> 1458.8799999999999
for a lack of better insight

1455.6 --> 1462.799
a primary infection because this i

1458.88 --> 1462.7990000000002
unfortunately have some experience

1462.96 --> 1468.559
i haven't had any

1464.48 --> 1469.6
anything for for years really thankfully

1468.559 --> 1472.1589999999999
but

1469.6 --> 1475.6
yeah the first time somebody gets

1472.159 --> 1476.72
infected however that actually works the

1475.6 --> 1479.9189999999999
trigger

1476.72 --> 1481.52
the first time is always like very bad

1479.919 --> 1483.679
like a real

1481.52 --> 1486.96
the feeling of an infection but after

1483.679 --> 1489.039
that it usually never gets that bad

1486.96 --> 1491.679
although i've heard with some people it

1489.039 --> 1493.36
does get back that bad continually

1491.679 --> 1495.279
that's terrible

1493.36 --> 1499.7199999999998
but i think it has more to do with your

1495.279 --> 1499.72
overall condition and your physiology

1502.08 --> 1508.799
because if you take very good care of

1504.0 --> 1508.799
yourself and you don't get carried away

1508.88 --> 1513.5200000000002
with like with your feelings in your

1511.12 --> 1518.3999999999999
sexual activities and all that

1513.52 --> 1518.4
there it doesn't really come up

1527.44 --> 1531.8400000000001
like that really stood out to me like i

1529.679 --> 1536.24
yeah i had like

1531.84 --> 1538.72
some minor herpes unfortunately

1536.24 --> 1540.64
cold sores or whatever

1538.72 --> 1542.72
yeah how do you want to call it

1540.64 --> 1544.88
and when i was young i had it a lot

1542.72 --> 1547.039
worse

1544.88 --> 1550.24
like it was really annoying and it made

1547.039 --> 1551.36
me feel ashamed and all kinds of [ __ ]

1550.24 --> 1554.72
but now

1551.36 --> 1556.8799999999999
if i ever get it it's usually so my new

1554.72 --> 1558.88
and it just goes away very quickly and i

1556.88 --> 1561.2
know how to deal with it and i know how

1558.88 --> 1565.44
to spot it early or the pre-signs and

1561.2 --> 1570.279
everything so it's just barely an issue

1565.44 --> 1570.279
and i'm not going to infect anybody ever

1571.919 --> 1577.44
but yeah when it was like a teenager it

1574.32 --> 1577.4399999999998
was pretty nasty

1579.679 --> 1584.48
and painful sometimes but maybe that's

1582.0 --> 1587.679
also because of just what i was eating

1584.48 --> 1589.679
back then because i wasn't eating

1587.679 --> 1592.64
organic or

1589.679 --> 1593.919
eating like chips with flavor enhancers

1592.64 --> 1598.0
and [ __ ]

1593.919 --> 1601.279
msg i i've suspected that msg has like a

1598.0 --> 1602.559
direct influence on how bad

1601.279 --> 1605.12
it gets

1602.559 --> 1607.12
specifically with herpes it would be an

1605.12 --> 1610.08
interesting theory to test this because

1607.12 --> 1612.0
hey msg is like a regular compound that

1610.08 --> 1613.12
typically goes around in all kinds of

1612.0 --> 1614.159
foods

1613.12 --> 1617.9189999999999
snacks

1614.159 --> 1617.919
a lot of people get exposed to it

1618.559 --> 1622.559
be interesting to kind of test that

1621.2 --> 1624.559
sort of

1622.559 --> 1627.039
have people think about it see whether

1624.559 --> 1629.36
it's true or not if there is

1627.039 --> 1631.84
like a symptomatic correlation if you

1629.36 --> 1632.9599999999998
eat msg

1631.84 --> 1635.03
herpes

1632.96 --> 1638.14
symptoms get worse

1635.03 --> 1638.1399999999999
[Music]

1638.84 --> 1644.6399999999999
right anyway

1641.679 --> 1647.709
yeah not a really pleasant subject

1644.64 --> 1647.709
[Music]

1648.399 --> 1651.039
and i'm very happy that i

1650.32 --> 1653.2
i

1651.039 --> 1654.96
yeah i don't really have it

1653.2 --> 1659.039
like i used to

1654.96 --> 1659.039
rarely even have it come up

1659.36 --> 1664.1589999999999
god raw diet

1661.6 --> 1668.039
raw meat

1664.159 --> 1668.0390000000002
50 raw meat

1673.76 --> 1679.919
does he also have like a

1677.039 --> 1681.679
free garden or landscape

1679.919 --> 1682.88
nature to roam through

1681.679 --> 1685.2
because that's

1682.88 --> 1688.0
that contributes significantly to the

1685.2 --> 1688.0
health of a cat

1693.279 --> 1698.559
because then they can actually socialize

1695.6 --> 1698.559
and be cats

1699.44 --> 1703.76
cats that are

1701.44 --> 1705.76
constantly locked into a building and

1703.76 --> 1709.36
really can't go out

1705.76 --> 1710.399
they usually get all kinds of like

1709.36 --> 1713.6789999999999
yeah

1710.399 --> 1713.6789999999999
psychological issues

1713.84 --> 1717.6789999999999
big garden woodland nearby okay that's

1716.64 --> 1721.279
great

1717.679 --> 1721.279
then at least he can be a cat

1721.84 --> 1725.84
not a very riveting conversation

1732.399 --> 1738.52
the cat is sitting out there like the

1734.88 --> 1738.5200000000002
neighborhood cat

1744.96 --> 1750.3600000000001
the virus caused bacteria infection hmm

1758.08 --> 1761.9189999999999
i don't know what that means the big

1764.84 --> 1770.84
m he brought you a mouse all right

1770.93 --> 1774.9
[Music]

1815.2 --> 1818.2
okay

1836.159 --> 1839.159
hmm

1864.32 --> 1866.6399999999999
we

1871.2 --> 1874.72
huh didn't read that earlier gary

1873.36 --> 1876.7199999999998
webenga

1874.72 --> 1881.039
one of your customers ended up in the

1876.72 --> 1881.039
hospital for a week after the second fax

1881.2 --> 1885.24
why did he even do it

1893.279 --> 1898.2
hey seeking star wars good to see you

1910.48 --> 1914.93
ah

1911.82 --> 1914.9299999999998
[Music]

1918.96 --> 1923.76
what's the topic today

1922.0 --> 1926.96
no title yeah i don't really have a

1923.76 --> 1926.96
specific topic today

1929.36 --> 1935.0
seem to be medical so far

1932.0 --> 1935.0
um

1943.76 --> 1947.519
yes the big m i know that i've been

1946.0 --> 1950.24
there actually

1947.519 --> 1950.24
in that place

1953.2 --> 1956.919
bagley nassau

1966.96 --> 1972.159
yes i heard i just heard a glimpse of

1969.6 --> 1974.32
that seeking star wars rumpus like the

1972.159 --> 1977.44
tacos

1974.32 --> 1981.039
scientific time trial it was completely

1977.44 --> 1981.039
fantastical and crazy

1983.039 --> 1988.679
like rumpus was sci-fi squirting i guess

1992.72 --> 1997.039
maybe it's because he got banned by

1994.64 --> 1997.039
nathan

1997.36 --> 2001.399
he's just stressing out

2026.559 --> 2031.6
yeah i know what you mean here we go

2028.08 --> 2032.96
again like it it gets so noisy and

2031.6 --> 2034.399
there's a lot of

2032.96 --> 2037.76
sorry to say

2034.399 --> 2039.039
really annoying people in there

2037.76 --> 2043.279
they're like

2039.039 --> 2044.799
loud and yelling and kind of dumb

2043.279 --> 2047.039
they're like not

2044.799 --> 2048.8
really hitting good points or anything

2047.039 --> 2050.8
they're just loud and in the way and

2048.8 --> 2053.76
noisy it's like i can't

2050.8 --> 2057.76
listen to that for too long it

2053.76 --> 2057.76
gets really annoying to me

2058.639 --> 2062.2400000000002
it's kind of rowdy and stupid

2065.52 --> 2069.96
sometimes they have their clear moments

2090.32 --> 2093.32
huh

2107.44 --> 2112.0
oh george net nuke

2109.359 --> 2112.0
he was there

2113.68 --> 2118.7999999999997
huh i didn't even know he he was still

2117.04 --> 2122.359
doing hangouts i haven't heard from him

2118.8 --> 2122.3590000000004
in a long time

2156.8 --> 2159.8
ah

2160.72 --> 2164.8799999999997
right so i also

2162.64 --> 2169.04
little detail

2164.88 --> 2171.599
finally got to meet the new roommate

2169.04 --> 2173.839
a girl

2171.599 --> 2177.04
i definitely recognize

2173.839 --> 2178.48
part of the type it's a really like an

2177.04 --> 2180.96
art person

2178.48 --> 2183.28
like uh

2180.96 --> 2185.52
somebody that's good at drawing creative

2183.28 --> 2187.0400000000004
drawing and

2185.52 --> 2189.2
and she's into

2187.04 --> 2191.44
that professionally

2189.2 --> 2193.2
so apparently she makes instruction

2191.44 --> 2195.119
videos

2193.2 --> 2198.0789999999997
the visuals for it

2195.119 --> 2198.079
probably with the team

2198.48 --> 2202.48
and yeah we had a little conversation

2200.4 --> 2204.32
about that because there's going to be a

2202.48 --> 2205.44
lot of work you know a lot of people get

2204.32 --> 2207.92
their

2205.44 --> 2212.16
their education from the internet one

2207.92 --> 2212.16
way or the other through various sources

2212.32 --> 2218.6400000000003
so there's a lot of that skill needed to

2215.839 --> 2221.359
build that apparently she not gonna get

2218.64 --> 2221.359
too specific

2221.92 --> 2229.64
she recently had a great new job making

2225.28 --> 2229.6400000000003
corona instruction videos

2234.8 --> 2238.1600000000003
that's going to be kind of an ice wall

2236.88 --> 2240.0
to

2238.16 --> 2243.0
break

2240.0 --> 2243.0
eventually

2245.359 --> 2248.72
that she's a really nice

2247.28 --> 2250.88
girl really

2248.72 --> 2252.8799999999997
doing her best

2250.88 --> 2254.32
and she's probably really good at what

2252.88 --> 2256.079
she does it just

2254.32 --> 2259.2000000000003
could just feel it off her but i haven't

2256.079 --> 2262.079
seen it demonstrated yet

2259.2 --> 2264.16
see that when she gets to work

2262.079 --> 2267.28
she has this great workstation with like

2264.16 --> 2267.2799999999997
two big monitors

2269.44 --> 2274.64
oh no yeah here we go again to see all

2272.4 --> 2276.88
these graphic designers they have a lot

2274.64 --> 2278.72
of work laid out for them

2276.88 --> 2280.6400000000003
to make these crazy

2278.72 --> 2281.68
instruction videos

2280.64 --> 2284.8799999999997
because

2281.68 --> 2286.64
the companies literally provide the work

2284.88 --> 2287.839
for that so what are you gonna do you

2286.64 --> 2289.92
know

2287.839 --> 2292.7999999999997
especially if you don't really know it's

2289.92 --> 2295.76
all [ __ ] up [ __ ]

2292.8 --> 2298.4
you're just gonna do that

2295.76 --> 2300.2400000000002
but i am gonna test her very carefully

2298.4 --> 2303.76
as to like

2300.24 --> 2303.7599999999998
do you know what's going on

2304.24 --> 2309.359
what do you think about vaccines

2307.52 --> 2310.96
do you know anything about the corona

2309.359 --> 2313.92
vaccine

2310.96 --> 2314.96
do you dare wander off in in internet

2313.92 --> 2316.64
land

2314.96 --> 2319.119
do you know about the conspiracy

2316.64 --> 2319.1189999999997
theories

2319.359 --> 2323.04
have you actually

2321.04 --> 2325.44
dug a little deeper than the just the

2323.04 --> 2326.96
crazy blabbering people because there is

2325.44 --> 2330.7200000000003
a lot of that

2326.96 --> 2330.7200000000003
it's like a wall you have to get through

2330.8 --> 2334.0
to find the good people

2334.079 --> 2338.079
right so yeah that's

2336.079 --> 2341.32
always interesting

2338.079 --> 2341.32
new people

2348.64 --> 2352.4
but yeah we we got along fine

2352.48 --> 2357.839
got to meet her mother

2354.56 --> 2357.839
as well helped her out

2358.72 --> 2363.3999999999996
i think i made a pretty good impression

2369.76 --> 2374.079
yes seeking star wars i hope so too

2374.56 --> 2379.2799999999997
at least there's not some

2376.8 --> 2380.96
i don't know weird chemistry going on or

2379.28 --> 2384.4
anything that's that would get in the

2380.96 --> 2386.32
way but the previous one there was that

2384.4 --> 2389.359
a little

2386.32 --> 2392.079
and that turned like totally foul

2389.359 --> 2392.0789999999997
by accident

2395.04 --> 2397.92
i don't think that's gonna happen with

2396.32 --> 2401.3590000000004
this girl

2397.92 --> 2401.359
i think we can be good friends

2401.599 --> 2407.119
but it is really more

2404.24 --> 2408.7999999999997
how open our mind is you know with this

2407.119 --> 2411.44
with reality

2408.8 --> 2413.04
like i might never even bring up flat

2411.44 --> 2414.56
earth ever

2413.04 --> 2417.68
but

2414.56 --> 2420.7999999999997
i will try to carefully

2417.68 --> 2422.16
make her aware just gradually lifting up

2420.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
that veil

2422.16 --> 2425.839
about the whole corona situation

2426.16 --> 2430.3999999999996
like how dangerous it really is

2429.52 --> 2431.52
like

2430.4 --> 2434.2400000000002
yeah

2431.52 --> 2434.24
very careful

2435.68 --> 2443.0
god i gotta do that it's

2438.96 --> 2443.0
my duty as a paladin

2454.319 --> 2459.4
history of dutch slavery oh

2476.72 --> 2479.72
so

2481.839 --> 2487.68
bobby steals really

2484.48 --> 2492.359
are you just making me talk about it

2487.68 --> 2492.359
or do you really not know

2506.96 --> 2511.119
it's only the most talked about

2509.76 --> 2513.92
subject

2511.119 --> 2516.319
in the last year ever

2513.92 --> 2519.319
are you seriously gonna ask me that

2516.319 --> 2519.319
question

2522.8 --> 2525.599
all right well there you go george

2524.16 --> 2527.44
sanford just

2525.599 --> 2530.96
summed it up as

2527.44 --> 2530.96
as concise as possible

2535.359 --> 2541.04
oh oh they're not aware of anything

2538.8 --> 2544.6400000000003
dangerous are they bobby stills

2541.04 --> 2546.8
okay well that's reassuring

2544.64 --> 2549.92
right when they're not aware oh that's

2546.8 --> 2552.92
that's all that's good enough for you i

2549.92 --> 2552.92
guess

2579.44 --> 2584.56
right yeah dude if hey if somebody

2582.16 --> 2588.72
that's hand that's doing all these

2584.56 --> 2593.0
procedures is ignorant about any dangers

2588.72 --> 2593.0
if that's good enough for you

2597.52 --> 2602.079
do they actually know what's in it

2599.76 --> 2605.88
do they know the process that it's

2602.079 --> 2605.88
supposed to be applying

2607.68 --> 2612.96
do they know about pcr tests how they

2610.24 --> 2616.319
actually work like seriously how much of

2612.96 --> 2618.56
a doctor is this doctor or these doctors

2616.319 --> 2620.16
that you supposedly talk to how much of

2618.56 --> 2623.04
a doctor are they really do they

2620.16 --> 2623.04
actually know

2623.359 --> 2627.7999999999997
what they're prescribing to people

2636.24 --> 2642.3999999999996
if i talk to a doctor about this well

2640.56 --> 2644.319
i've

2642.4 --> 2646.2400000000002
talked well i've seen

2644.319 --> 2649.2799999999997
many doctors

2646.24 --> 2652.16
do their thing on youtube

2649.28 --> 2654.3190000000004
and by their words you can tell

2652.16 --> 2656.48
right and those are like real doctors

2654.319 --> 2657.7599999999998
and some of them do get fired because of

2656.48 --> 2660.56
it and [ __ ]

2657.76 --> 2662.6400000000003
yeah they do it and they do it well

2660.56 --> 2664.7999999999997
and they do it honestly and they prove

2662.64 --> 2664.7999999999997
in

2665.44 --> 2671.119
in their declarations that they do know

2668.4 --> 2674.599
what they're actually talking about

2671.119 --> 2674.599
more than most

2684.0 --> 2688.16
yeah yeah you see bobby steals

2686.8 --> 2689.599
i don't see

2688.16 --> 2692.24
a doctor

2689.599 --> 2694.319
as some of some kind of a medical

2692.24 --> 2696.3999999999996
priestly authority

2694.319 --> 2698.4
right

2696.4 --> 2702.7200000000003
i've known doctors

2698.4 --> 2702.7200000000003
i pretty much am my doctor

2702.96 --> 2708.16
eclectic i've known doctors

2706.079 --> 2711.6800000000003
i've talked to doctors i've always been

2708.16 --> 2716.2
very curious i've had biology i i wanted

2711.68 --> 2716.2
to be a doctor too

2721.92 --> 2726.7200000000003
yeah and i

2723.68 --> 2727.839
still talk to people

2726.72 --> 2730.3999999999996
that are

2727.839 --> 2730.4
doctors

2730.48 --> 2734.16
guess what they're saying yeah they're

2732.16 --> 2736.48
echoing the same thing because it's all

2734.16 --> 2739.1189999999997
tapped from the same sources

2736.48 --> 2742.079
so like pubmed stuff yeah i know about

2739.119 --> 2744.8
pubmed right i know my source i know how

2742.079 --> 2747.3590000000004
it actually works pattern recognition

2744.8 --> 2750.079
and really good at it

2747.359 --> 2754.56
have had medical interests

2750.079 --> 2754.5600000000004
for like 20 years intellectually

2755.68 --> 2761.839
between more 30 years

2759.28 --> 2764.1600000000003
from all directions

2761.839 --> 2767.359
so oh oh it's good yeah yeah bobby

2764.16 --> 2768.64
steals yet take it take it [ __ ]

2767.359 --> 2770.64
take it

2768.64 --> 2771.52
take that [ __ ] thing and again and

2770.64 --> 2775.5989999999997
again

2771.52 --> 2779.119
get your [ __ ] booster kuronu vaccine

2775.599 --> 2780.96
shot every half a year yeah

2779.119 --> 2783.28
till your name stops appearing in the

2780.96 --> 2785.359
chat how about that

2783.28 --> 2787.0400000000004
already took it take it again take it

2785.359 --> 2789.359
again [ __ ]

2787.04 --> 2790.24
take it again jab it in there

2789.359 --> 2791.92
more

2790.24 --> 2794.24
more

2791.92 --> 2796.079
keep pumping keep pumping that freaking

2794.24 --> 2798.72
syringe

2796.079 --> 2800.48
keep doing it [ __ ]

2798.72 --> 2802.3999999999996
it's all good

2800.48 --> 2804.72
yeah yeah keep taking it

2802.4 --> 2806.96
keep taking it [ __ ]

2804.72 --> 2806.9599999999996
go

2808.079 --> 2817.1600000000003
immunity now what immunity chabinator

2812.72 --> 2820.7999999999997
it's not even [ __ ] claimed to be

2817.16 --> 2825.7599999999998
physiologically related to the [ __ ]

2820.8 --> 2828.5600000000004
virus literally not a relation with the

2825.76 --> 2831.6800000000003
virus in any form

2828.56 --> 2833.839
none of it it's complete horseshit it's

2831.68 --> 2835.359
not a vaccine

2833.839 --> 2839.44
mechanically

2835.359 --> 2840.4
and it's not a vaccine effectively

2839.44 --> 2842.16
right

2840.4 --> 2843.359
because even

2842.16 --> 2845.2799999999997
hey

2843.359 --> 2846.72
if you got something

2845.28 --> 2849.28
a process

2846.72 --> 2852.72
that somehow actually starts preventing

2849.28 --> 2855.2000000000003
a medical condition you might call it a

2852.72 --> 2856.9599999999996
vaccine it's kind of a reification you

2855.2 --> 2860.16
might call it because it actually does

2856.96 --> 2862.4
something to the process at hand right

2860.16 --> 2865.359
well guess what this [ __ ] thing

2862.4 --> 2866.559
doesn't even have a relation to the

2865.359 --> 2868.48
condition

2866.559 --> 2871.0400000000004
you idiot

2868.48 --> 2872.559
yeah so keep jabbing it in there come on

2871.04 --> 2875.359
keep pumping it

2872.559 --> 2878.6400000000003
keep pumping that vaccine [ __ ]

2875.359 --> 2878.64
go ahead [ __ ]

2880.16 --> 2884.04
now laugh it up fundy

2890.82 --> 2894.0190000000002
[Music]

2898.28 --> 2903.2690000000002
[Music]

2909.92 --> 2917.359
oh the vaccine is working is it

2913.319 --> 2920.24
desdemona is it working now really

2917.359 --> 2921.2
so are you saying that nobody there now

2920.24 --> 2923.5989999999997
gets

2921.2 --> 2925.5989999999997
the condition

2923.599 --> 2927.76
or is it actually

2925.599 --> 2930.4
a record amount of people are getting

2927.76 --> 2930.4
the condition

2930.88 --> 2934.319
right you provide that data

2935.04 --> 2940.0
yeah you know how many people get this

2937.28 --> 2942.2400000000002
freaking shot

2940.0 --> 2944.24
that literally get the condition pretty

2942.24 --> 2947.52
much right after

2944.24 --> 2950.8799999999997
and you can't even say it's caused by it

2947.52 --> 2952.48
as in infection cause no it's because

2950.88 --> 2954.079
corona

2952.48 --> 2957.76
it's a condition

2954.079 --> 2959.04
and if you attack your body

2957.76 --> 2960.96
then yeah

2959.04 --> 2962.88
if your body is attacked there's going

2960.96 --> 2964.16
to be a lot of toxins going around in

2962.88 --> 2967.2000000000003
your body

2964.16 --> 2969.5989999999997
the virus particles

2967.2 --> 2972.48
yeah that are inherent to your body

2969.599 --> 2974.88
they're part of your body

2972.48 --> 2977.04
they're gonna start multiplying to clean

2974.88 --> 2979.04
up the toxins and then you're gonna get

2977.04 --> 2982.0
the side effects which is the corona

2979.04 --> 2984.24
condition yeah that can definitely arise

2982.0 --> 2986.16
after you've taken the vaccine because

2984.24 --> 2988.7999999999997
you're literally attacking your body

2986.16 --> 2990.24
with all kinds of complicated chemicals

2988.8 --> 2991.28
and [ __ ]

2990.24 --> 2993.5989999999997
causing

2991.28 --> 2996.6400000000003
yeah

2993.599 --> 2999.3590000000004
subtle processes in the genetics to

2996.64 --> 3001.04
become distorted to change your the

2999.359 --> 3003.2
makeup of your body yeah it's going to

3001.04 --> 3004.16
be attacked so the condition is going to

3003.2 --> 3005.839
arrive

3004.16 --> 3008.0789999999997
so yeah

3005.839 --> 3008.0789999999997
uh

3010.4 --> 3015.44
rates and deaths in israel is good

3012.88 --> 3018.079
that's [ __ ]

3015.44 --> 3020.319
that's mona that's total misinformation

3018.079 --> 3022.559
[ __ ] and you know it you're a liar

3020.319 --> 3024.0
right now

3022.559 --> 3027.559
you're a liar

3024.0 --> 3027.559
go [ __ ] yourself

3030.64 --> 3036.5989999999997
yes jabynator

3032.48 --> 3036.599
i guess you were agreeing

3040.64 --> 3047.2
right but the thing is chabinator if the

3043.119 --> 3047.2000000000003
doctor say you get immunity now

3047.44 --> 3055.359
even that is a lie the only immunity

3052.319 --> 3057.44
you're gonna be getting from that thing

3055.359 --> 3060.0
is placebo

3057.44 --> 3061.76
immunity because they say it that's the

3060.0 --> 3063.839
only

3061.76 --> 3066.88
way you're gonna get any immunity out of

3063.839 --> 3069.119
it it's because you believe you will get

3066.88 --> 3072.2400000000002
it out of it

3069.119 --> 3075.119
right because it doesn't actually do

3072.24 --> 3078.3999999999996
anything you could take a sugar pill

3075.119 --> 3082.319
be told this is gonna give you temporary

3078.4 --> 3084.319
immunity and if you really believe it

3082.319 --> 3086.319
really believe it not try to make

3084.319 --> 3088.5589999999997
yourself believe it but really believe

3086.319 --> 3090.16
it that that's possible

3088.559 --> 3092.7200000000003
that the doctor's got it figure it out

3090.16 --> 3094.0
or whatever then the placebo effect may

3092.72 --> 3096.64
actually

3094.0 --> 3098.8
help stabilize your body and cause you

3096.64 --> 3100.72
to have that temporary immunity because

3098.8 --> 3103.44
you believed it right

3100.72 --> 3106.24
a sugar pill

3103.44 --> 3108.48
is not heavy toxic attack on your body

3106.24 --> 3109.4399999999996
though that's the difference right so

3108.48 --> 3112.4
hey

3109.44 --> 3113.839
just take that sugar pill i believe

3112.4 --> 3116.1600000000003
you're gonna get immunity out of it

3113.839 --> 3118.24
that's a lot safer than just injecting

3116.16 --> 3122.96
yourself with

3118.24 --> 3124.72
experimental medical waste

3122.96 --> 3128.44

3147.52 --> 3152.319
right well there you go nathan r and he

3149.68 --> 3152.319
knows a lot

3157.68 --> 3162.9199999999996
right i pay attention to this sort of

3159.92 --> 3162.92
thing

3166.48 --> 3172.16
it's like i'm literally studying it

3169.599 --> 3173.52
as it goes as it happens because this is

3172.16 --> 3176.0789999999997
literally

3173.52 --> 3178.64
a live psychological

3176.079 --> 3181.92
and medical combined experiment that's

3178.64 --> 3185.52
happening right now worldwide publicly

3181.92 --> 3189.359
it's a psychological medical experiment

3185.52 --> 3189.359
that's what this covet is

3193.68 --> 3198.0
psychological experiment is

3196.0 --> 3200.48
like yeah

3198.0 --> 3202.64
are you gonna actually take personal

3200.48 --> 3205.28
response an intellectual responsibility

3202.64 --> 3207.5989999999997
or are you going go with the narrative

3205.28 --> 3208.8
of the horde no matter how crazy it get

3207.599 --> 3210.8
gets

3208.8 --> 3212.7200000000003
that's a psychological experiment and

3210.8 --> 3215.28
the medical experiment is the freaking

3212.72 --> 3218.0789999999997
content of

3215.28 --> 3222.3190000000004
the covet vaccine that's not a vaccine

3218.079 --> 3225.04
it's literally a medical experiment

3222.319 --> 3231.16
because it hasn't been tested before

3225.04 --> 3231.16
these live tests which is what they are

outer the hour's already up

3293.52 --> 3297.64
i might go on a little longer

3312.48 --> 3319.52
nah it seems like bobby has set his ways

3315.599 --> 3321.3590000000004
you know he said his ways on flat earth

3319.52 --> 3324.319
how he's gonna look at that

3321.359 --> 3327.5989999999997
now he's gonna hang on to the ball

3324.319 --> 3329.7599999999998
and yeah right next to the ball sci-fi

3327.599 --> 3333.44
guess what happens in all sci-fi series

3329.76 --> 3335.6800000000003
there's viruses there's vaccines yeah so

3333.44 --> 3339.92
he's just not gonna give it up

3335.68 --> 3339.9199999999996
he's ready to die for his beliefs

3340.16 --> 3343.04
that's what this is

he's signaling like

3345.44 --> 3350.0
i am faithful

3348.079 --> 3352.6400000000003
i shall die

yeah dude bobby get ready to if you're

3384.16 --> 3387.5989999999997
gonna survive through all these freaking

3386.16 --> 3391.1189999999997

3387.599 --> 3393.2000000000003
i it's up to you man we hey don't tell

3391.119 --> 3395.52
us we didn't warn you

you know

3396.16 --> 3400.0
it's not a joke

3398.079 --> 3402.079

3400.0 --> 3405.839
this dude you might become all magnetic

and [ __ ] who knows what's gonna happen

3405.839 --> 3408.64
right

3407.2 --> 3410.799
there's a whole bunch of people out

3408.64 --> 3413.799
there that are gonna be magnetic maybe

3410.799 --> 3413.799
permanently

3418.96 --> 3422.88
it's going to have all kinds of weird

3420.4 --> 3422.88

tara i was in the middle of a

3466.0 --> 3471.4
conversation with him

3467.68 --> 3471.3999999999996
why did you do that

3481.359 --> 3487.04
good call what do you mean

3483.599 --> 3489.44
since when do you guys have permission

3487.04 --> 3491.7599999999998
to just ban somebody i'm literally in

3489.44 --> 3494.16
the middle of a conversation with

3491.76 --> 3494.1600000000003
tarit

3499.119 --> 3504.319
yeah no [ __ ] territ but i was in the

3501.68 --> 3506.24
middle of a conversation with him you

3504.319 --> 3508.24
don't ban people

3506.24 --> 3510.64
when the show host is in the middle of a

3508.24 --> 3513.2
conversation with them

3510.64 --> 3513.2
thank you

3515.2 --> 3517.839
right

3519.92 --> 3525.839
not that it was that much of a

3521.599 --> 3525.839
conversation it was mostly me just

3526.48 --> 3532.4
imprinting on him what he

3528.96 --> 3534.48
hopefully will wake up to later

3532.4 --> 3537.6800000000003
and then make a couple of better

3534.48 --> 3537.68
decisions for himself

3538.24 --> 3542.3999999999996
and who knows maybe he'll become less

3540.4 --> 3545.4
gay in the process you know it's worth

3542.4 --> 3545.4
it

3552.559 --> 3558.88
but yes territ i agree he is a clown and

3555.68 --> 3560.8799999999997
he is probably trolling but i think he's

3558.88 --> 3563.2000000000003
also halfway serious about what he's

3560.88 --> 3563.2000000000003
doing

3564.799 --> 3568.4
he probably did take the shot

3569.2 --> 3573.3999999999996
people are that stupid

3577.76 --> 3582.8390000000004
so you are gay bobby steals

3595.28 --> 3599.52
yes it's all bannable offense i know but

3597.839 --> 3603.319
i'm in the middle of a conversation with

3599.52 --> 3603.319
him right

3614.64 --> 3618.8799999999997
right seeking style water i know it's

3616.72 --> 3620.72
kind of a waste of time

3618.88 --> 3623.52
engaging with somebody that's trolling

3620.72 --> 3626.0789999999997
like that but if you're gonna kick them

3623.52 --> 3628.799
you gotta find the right moment so that

3626.079 --> 3631.3590000000004
your kick will actually launch them

3628.799 --> 3633.92
further than if you just kick them at

3631.359 --> 3637.2
the first convenience you know need to

3633.92 --> 3637.2000000000003
use the right momentum

3638.88 --> 3642.92
i'm still waiting for a moment

3658.88 --> 3662.4
okay george sanford that's

3664.64 --> 3668.24
technically kind of correct

3669.68 --> 3673.839
does sound really homophobic like that

3671.839 --> 3678.0
though when you say it like that but

3673.839 --> 3680.16
yeah i just say it's a mistake

3678.0 --> 3682.24
it's a compounding mistake

3680.16 --> 3685.3999999999996
it's like a directional mistake of what

3682.24 --> 3685.3999999999996
you're doing

3687.839 --> 3693.359
it's choosing

3689.92 --> 3693.359
will over nature

3694.079 --> 3699.8390000000004
like against nature and that's not good

3697.04 --> 3699.839
that's gay

3706.8 --> 3709.829

3719.2 --> 3722.2

3740.64 --> 3746.4
okay that's it bobby stills

3743.52 --> 3746.4
that's all you got

3747.44 --> 3751.2000000000003
a bunch of cackling laughs and

3749.68 --> 3754.24
projections

3751.2 --> 3757.3999999999996
all right okay well tara 306 you can ban

thanks

3785.359 --> 3787.5989999999997
right

3788.4 --> 3794.799
i mean he's probably still pissed off

3790.079 --> 3799.2400000000002
that i banned him in and at the fed chat

3794.799 --> 3799.24
he has a lot of stock accounts though

3828.24 --> 3832.0789999999997
right

3829.68 --> 3834.48
yeah hey an echo chamber like a sonic

3832.079 --> 3834.48
chamber

3834.64 --> 3838.72
like those in the pyramids or

3837.28 --> 3840.559
next to that

3838.72 --> 3842.8799999999997
it's like these sonic chambers that you

3840.559 --> 3844.6400000000003
can literally if you hit a certain tone

3842.88 --> 3846.48
it starts resonating and even has a

3844.64 --> 3848.48
healing effect yeah i'd like to call

3846.48 --> 3850.48
those active chambers yeah if you're in

3848.48 --> 3852.4
the middle of doing that

3850.48 --> 3853.68
having an actual healing

3852.4 --> 3855.599
influence

3853.68 --> 3857.839
and then somebody just walks in and

3855.599 --> 3860.319
starts [ __ ] on the floor making a

3857.839 --> 3863.44
lot of [ __ ] sound yeah that's going

3860.319 --> 3863.44
to get in the way

3863.52 --> 3870.119
of the healing effect of the sound

3865.76 --> 3870.119
you're trying to produce that's right

3897.52 --> 3903.119
mystery deadly brain disease

3899.92 --> 3905.76
well it's not that mysterious it's

3903.119 --> 3908.4
related to mad cow's disease

3905.76 --> 3911.119
as alzheimer's influences because of the

3908.4 --> 3913.44
spike protein right

3911.119 --> 3914.96
and how it's actually locally being

3913.44 --> 3917.119
produced

3914.96 --> 3920.76
instead of just getting a large dosage

3917.119 --> 3920.76
of it and all that

3923.52 --> 3927.92
it

3924.319 --> 3930.72
yeah but i've heard about it

3927.92 --> 3932.96
it's all kinds of like

3930.72 --> 3934.799
yeah the whole range of

3932.96 --> 3937.359
diseases are

3934.799 --> 3939.839
terrible mental conditions are coming

3937.359 --> 3942.16
out of these shots

3939.839 --> 3945.4
that are not vaccines

3942.16 --> 3945.3999999999996
that's right

3958.799 --> 3963.52
nanotech

3961.28 --> 3966.88
i don't know if it's really nanotech

3963.52 --> 3966.88
it's more biotech

3967.28 --> 3971.76
here we go again they've duke what

3969.44 --> 3974.96
they've done is kind of like

3971.76 --> 3977.599
back engineered some of the microbiology

3974.96 --> 3978.799
systems that naturally take place in the

3977.599 --> 3981.6800000000003
body

3978.799 --> 3984.24
and then use that to kind of weaponize

3981.68 --> 3986.319
invasive alterations

3984.24 --> 3988.799
and yeah that can

3986.319 --> 3990.96
probably get through blood brain barrier

3988.799 --> 3993.52
and all kinds of things

3990.96 --> 3996.7200000000003
like the actual injected substances

3993.52 --> 3996.72
could probably do that

3997.599 --> 4003.4
but it's not nano attack

4000.079 --> 4003.4
it's biotech

4010.559 --> 4014.48
it's using the body's own

4012.96 --> 4017.039
microbiological

4014.48 --> 4017.039
systems

4017.28 --> 4020.96
against it

4019.76 --> 4024.559
to hack it

4020.96 --> 4024.559
like biohacking in a way

4032.839 --> 4040.839
yeah oh my god

4036.96 --> 4040.839
really nathan r

4051.119 --> 4054.839
hello fe diplomatic

4068.72 --> 4074.72
using nanotech in that look here we go

4071.119 --> 4077.52
again nanotech it's so complicated right

4074.72 --> 4080.48
what really makes nanotech

4077.52 --> 4080.48
is that it is a

4080.96 --> 4085.52
non-living

4082.64 --> 4087.1189999999997
non-back engineered like a completely

4085.52 --> 4089.28
foreign

4087.119 --> 4091.599
substance usually

4089.28 --> 4094.0
made of materials that usually the body

4091.599 --> 4098.56
don't doesn't even use right

4094.0 --> 4100.239
and then it starts building things like

4098.56 --> 4102.96
more gallons

4100.239 --> 4104.5599999999995
that's nano attack

4102.96 --> 4106.08
because it's not living

4104.56 --> 4109.120000000001
if it's living

4106.08 --> 4111.44
is actually based on actual biological

4109.12 --> 4113.92
substances and processes and whatever

4111.44 --> 4118.799
proteins and all that then it's biotech

4113.92 --> 4121.6
it's different nanotech is not living

4118.799 --> 4123.92
it's like micro

4121.6 --> 4128.1990000000005
chemical robots

4123.92 --> 4128.1990000000005
that are completely inorganic

4132.0 --> 4136.279
no not necessarily self-replicating

4141.759 --> 4146.279
but they do have mechanical processes

4158.799 --> 4162.319
and affected by the magnetism right but

4161.359 --> 4165.120000000001
that

4162.319 --> 4167.4400000000005
that's not necessarily the nano attack

4165.12 --> 4167.44
though

4169.44 --> 4175.2789999999995
that might literally be an alteration to

4172.159 --> 4176.719
the cells that become magnetic because

4175.279 --> 4180.799000000001
of it

4176.719 --> 4180.799
not sure though can be either

4182.719 --> 4187.12
there's people out there that are

4185.04 --> 4190.719
naturally magnetic

4187.12 --> 4193.199
i've just seen the videos guys with like

4190.719 --> 4193.199
like uh

4193.359 --> 4197.04
with an iron

4194.96 --> 4199.36
stuck to them like that

4197.04 --> 4201.12
right they didn't get no vaccines for

4199.36 --> 4203.759999999999
that

4201.12 --> 4206.5599999999995
they were just born that way

4203.76 --> 4209.360000000001
right so there is this ability

4206.56 --> 4211.84
biologically to be magnetic

4209.36 --> 4213.599999999999
so it might be causing an alteration to

4211.84 --> 4214.8
cause that

4213.6 --> 4216.719
or we have

4214.8 --> 4219.76
well there might be nano attack actually

4216.719 --> 4219.76
causing that i don't know

4225.6 --> 4230.4800000000005
but i haven't heard from any nano tech

4228.239 --> 4233.799999999999
description so far so far it just seems

4230.48 --> 4233.799999999999
to be biotech

4251.76 --> 4257.96
yeah he's not making stuff up there

4254.0 --> 4257.96
howdy oh i'm billy

4258.56 --> 4261.84
more gallons is real

4262.64 --> 4268.4800000000005
it was sprayed through chemtrails in the

4265.44 --> 4272.08
united states specifically

4268.48 --> 4274.5599999999995
and a lot of people got it

4272.08 --> 4276.48
like and this stuff doesn't die it's

4274.56 --> 4279.280000000001
like a crystal

4276.48 --> 4279.28
it doesn't die

4281.12 --> 4285.04
if it has availability of the right

4283.28 --> 4288.159
substances around it

4285.04 --> 4291.28
the hair things will keep growing

4288.159 --> 4292.799999999999
that is made up no it's not [ __ ]

4291.28 --> 4296.599999999999
it's real

4292.8 --> 4296.6
it's not made up

4308.239 --> 4313.36
well the more gallons is definitely

4310.0 --> 4315.44
there and it was absolutely regional

4313.36 --> 4318.96
so it's pretty much been pointed down by

4315.44 --> 4322.0
the morgellons researchers

4318.96 --> 4323.84
not just blabbering conspiracy theorists

4322.0 --> 4325.92
people that have done actual medical

4323.84 --> 4328.8
research involving it

4325.92 --> 4329.84
back in the day a decade ago

4328.8 --> 4332.96
yeah

4329.84 --> 4336.32
it's very likely it was sprayed

4332.96 --> 4338.96
also animals have been found dead with

4336.32 --> 4338.96
that stuff

4339.12 --> 4343.12
so yeah

4340.48 --> 4346.639999999999
it was probably chemtrailed and it was a

4343.12 --> 4348.5599999999995
biot or a nanotech experiment when they

4346.64 --> 4350.56
did it

4348.56 --> 4354.52
can i kick him please no

4350.56 --> 4354.52
no no not yet

4357.28 --> 4361.759999999999
you can't tell when you made something

4359.04 --> 4364.32
no stop being a [ __ ]

4361.76 --> 4365.84
dude go okay seeking star wars you can

4364.32 --> 4367.92
kick him now

4365.84 --> 4370.400000000001
[ __ ] you you piece of [ __ ]

4367.92 --> 4372.88
take the facts and die billy go [ __ ]

4370.4 --> 4372.879999999999

4373.84 --> 4377.1990000000005
bye piece of [ __ ]

4381.92 --> 4387.4400000000005
come on seeking star water what are you

4383.6 --> 4387.4400000000005
waiting for you got the green light

4387.679 --> 4393.679
jay to help no you're a piece of [ __ ]

4390.32 --> 4395.599999999999
and a [ __ ] we don't need your reversed

4393.679 --> 4398.4
world lunacy help

4395.6 --> 4401.1990000000005
yeah your help leads to death we don't

4398.4 --> 4401.199
need your help

4404.8 --> 4413.719
and yeah there you go timed out

4409.04 --> 4413.719
our timeout is fine as well i don't care

4436.159 --> 4440.239
yes some healthcare professionals

4438.08 --> 4442.88
classify yeah that you know why they did

4440.239 --> 4444.799999999999
that because they couldn't believe it

4442.88 --> 4446.96
because they literally couldn't believe

4444.8 --> 4446.96
it

4448.32 --> 4453.04
and there have been people when it kind

4450.96 --> 4456.4
of came out the morgellons

4453.04 --> 4460.0
situation people went completely out of

4456.4 --> 4462.48
their minds in scare over it totally

4460.0 --> 4463.679
i was kind of fearful when i first heard

4462.48 --> 4466.0
about it

4463.679 --> 4468.32
it's like this idea of the gray super

4466.0 --> 4469.76
like oh they're spraying

4468.32 --> 4471.599999999999
nanotech

4469.76 --> 4474.56
who knows what they're gonna spray and

4471.6 --> 4477.52
it might be the end of all life it might

4474.56 --> 4480.159000000001
eat everything right the big gray soup

4477.52 --> 4481.1990000000005
yeah it was a terrifying idea at the

4480.159 --> 4483.759999999999
time

4481.199 --> 4487.36
people didn't know when it first came up

4483.76 --> 4489.52
what was actually happening

4487.36 --> 4492.4
it turned out not to be as dramatic as a

4489.52 --> 4495.1990000000005
gray soup scenario

4492.4 --> 4497.679
but yeah people absolutely got out of

4495.199 --> 4500.4
their mind with fear like oh test me if

4497.679 --> 4502.32
i have a morgellon somewhere yeah that

4500.4 --> 4503.759999999999
did happen right so yeah a couple of

4502.32 --> 4505.759999999999
doctors which which would have never

4503.76 --> 4507.4400000000005
seen an actual morgellons case would

4505.76 --> 4509.4400000000005
think yeah it's mental illness these

4507.44 --> 4510.799999999999
people are just totally paranoid over

4509.44 --> 4511.919999999999
this [ __ ]

4510.8 --> 4514.320000000001
yeah

4511.92 --> 4516.64
because that did probably happen a lot

4514.32 --> 4519.12
of people probably did completely get

4516.64 --> 4520.96
paranoid over it doesn't mean it's not

4519.12 --> 4522.4
real

4520.96 --> 4525.199
yeah

4522.4 --> 4528.239
because i've seen like live video

4525.199 --> 4530.719
footage and even microscope footage

4528.239 --> 4533.759999999999
moving with the freaking morgellons

4530.719 --> 4536.0
hairs growing and [ __ ] like that's

4533.76 --> 4538.0
real and i learned some weird things

4536.0 --> 4540.88
about it too because apparently

4538.0 --> 4542.4
morgellons typically grows on things

4540.88 --> 4544.4800000000005
like msg

4542.4 --> 4545.759999999999
chemical

4544.48 --> 4547.678999999999
and

4545.76 --> 4549.280000000001
other things like

4547.679 --> 4550.8
ammonia

4549.28 --> 4552.8
right all kinds of

4550.8 --> 4555.679
waste products

4552.8 --> 4558.400000000001
on a cellular level of the body and it

4555.679 --> 4559.679
actually grows on that it was quite

4558.4 --> 4562.239
bizarre

4559.679 --> 4564.88
when i first learned about this so yeah

4562.239 --> 4567.759999999999
that thing is real but

4564.88 --> 4570.08
it's not gonna be that everybody got it

4567.76 --> 4574.0
no a bunch of people got it

4570.08 --> 4575.92
dead animals found with that in them

4574.0 --> 4578.56
and a whole bunch of people went

4575.92 --> 4581.04
completely nuts and paranoid over it and

4578.56 --> 4583.120000000001
nagged their doctors endlessly about it

4581.04 --> 4585.44
yeah that happened too

4583.12 --> 4588.239
that doesn't make it unreal that doesn't

4585.44 --> 4590.08
make it fake people did actually get

4588.239 --> 4592.0
that

4590.08 --> 4594.88
but it was

4592.0 --> 4597.679
in a small period which would have made

4594.88 --> 4600.56
it very likely to be a single spray

4597.679 --> 4601.84
event and not something that continually

4600.56 --> 4603.6
happened

4601.84 --> 4606.08
right

4603.6 --> 4609.320000000001
that's how i size it up

4606.08 --> 4609.32
right now

4624.48 --> 4629.12
first i heard of it well georgetown

4626.159 --> 4632.48
that's because it's so last decade

4629.12 --> 4634.5599999999995
right that all happened like in the

4632.48 --> 4636.799999999999
in the first 10 years

4634.56 --> 4638.4800000000005
it was somewhere early

4636.8 --> 4639.92
post 9 11

4638.48 --> 4641.678999999999
somewhere

4639.92 --> 4644.719
when was it exactly when that happened

4641.679 --> 4647.36
was it 2006 or something i don't know

4644.719 --> 4649.84
exactly when it was but it was like

4647.36 --> 4652.32
somewhere the first decade this this

4649.84 --> 4652.32
century

4652.56 --> 4655.1990000000005
and

4654.0 --> 4657.36
yeah

4655.199 --> 4659.36
then kind of other things happened and

4657.36 --> 4662.4
it kind of moved into the background and

4659.36 --> 4664.639999999999
something like that never happened again

4662.4 --> 4666.4
it was like a single test event it's not

4664.64 --> 4669.12
something that keeps popping up

4666.4 --> 4669.12
continually

4669.679 --> 4675.1990000000005
but yeah at the time especially on alex

4672.239 --> 4677.759999999999
jones yeah endless fear hyping

4675.199 --> 4680.48
like gray soup scenario grey soup snack

4677.76 --> 4682.64
yeah yeah yeah alex thanks for that

4680.48 --> 4682.639999999999
but

4682.719 --> 4688.4
he was always like overblowing it

4686.08 --> 4691.12
to really be attention grabby

4688.4 --> 4693.04
and that probably did also so some

4691.12 --> 4695.36
paranoia but that doesn't mean that

4693.04 --> 4698.0
nothing happened because the morgellons

4695.36 --> 4702.04
thing really did happen i believe so

4698.0 --> 4702.04
i've seen by footage

4716.32 --> 4719.88
wireless earphones

4725.52 --> 4729.84
really use them listening to my show i

4728.159 --> 4732.32
don't know i would recommend against

4729.84 --> 4733.6
that i don't use wireless headphones

4732.32 --> 4736.719
ever

4733.6 --> 4736.719
it's way too close

4736.8 --> 4740.320000000001
to you to the tissues

4741.36 --> 4746.32
like even when i wear a regular

4743.679 --> 4747.679
headphone the one that i got

4746.32 --> 4751.5199999999995
here

4747.679 --> 4751.52
this one remember good headphone

4751.6 --> 4757.52
even just the magnet in it

4755.04 --> 4760.159
if i wear it for long enough it'll start

4757.52 --> 4762.4800000000005
to have like a weird influence on the i

4760.159 --> 4765.199
think on the fluids

4762.48 --> 4767.44
inside of my

4765.199 --> 4769.599999999999
yeah side of the tissue here around my

4767.44 --> 4771.759999999999
ear like i can literally start feeling

4769.6 --> 4774.400000000001
it it's really annoying so i'm never

4771.76 --> 4778.320000000001
gonna use wireless for that

4774.4 --> 4778.32
and i have very sensitive ears

4780.64 --> 4784.35
all right

4781.29 --> 4784.35
[Music]

4786.719 --> 4790.36
it's all messy

4810.08 --> 4815.76
right yeah here we go again and some

4811.92 --> 4817.679
people got affected by it really badly

4815.76 --> 4821.4400000000005
like they had like like they were

4817.679 --> 4821.4400000000005
getting invaded by that [ __ ]

4821.679 --> 4825.6
and like the wires

4823.36 --> 4827.679
would like they would literally complain

4825.6 --> 4830.400000000001
that it hurt so much because the wires

4827.679 --> 4832.4800000000005
were like growing and digging like right

4830.4 --> 4834.96
through living tissue as [ __ ] like

4832.48 --> 4837.44
literally just like a slow piercing was

4834.96 --> 4837.44
terrible

4841.84 --> 4845.52
and there was sometimes dangers that

4843.679 --> 4849.639
like it could even end up piercing

4845.52 --> 4849.639
organs and [ __ ] terrible

4870.239 --> 4873.599999999999
sting

4872.0 --> 4875.84
what are you talking about george

4873.6 --> 4875.84
sanford

4905.36 --> 4910.4
pcr test used to test for it really how

4913.52 --> 4916.52
weird

4938.159 --> 4941.5199999999995
virus

4939.28 --> 4941.5199999999995
what

4942.159 --> 4945.839999999999
i don't know what that is

4968.96 --> 4971.28
what

4971.679 --> 4975.639
what is that wire blue

4990.96 --> 4993.6
you're certainly moving in with

4992.239 --> 4997.32
something else here i don't know

4993.6 --> 4997.320000000001
anything about that

5005.76 --> 5010.2390000000005
oh right the red algae bloom thing yeah

5008.639 --> 5012.719
that's that's something else that's

5010.239 --> 5015.678999999999
natural

5012.719 --> 5019.6
yeah that's like a very toxic

5015.679 --> 5019.6
heavily toxic algae

5020.88 --> 5026.04
and like some algaes are extremely

5023.04 --> 5026.04
dangerous

5029.12 --> 5033.5199999999995
that was used to clean up to be no but

5031.44 --> 5035.5199999999995
that wasn't that

5033.52 --> 5038.080000000001
now that was chemical

5035.52 --> 5038.080000000001
garbage

5038.32 --> 5043.599999999999
that wasn't algae

5040.4 --> 5045.759999999999
or maybe was it cold red tide okay

5043.6 --> 5046.8
right but it wasn't like an algae or

5045.76 --> 5049.84
anything

5046.8 --> 5052.2390000000005
now that those were just chemicals

5049.84 --> 5053.76
that kind of like stuck to the oil and

5052.239 --> 5056.32
then made it

5053.76 --> 5057.6
go to the bottom but it was extremely

5056.32 --> 5062.0
toxic

5057.6 --> 5062.0
like much more toxic than the actual oil

5063.92 --> 5067.719
synthetic organism

5072.88 --> 5076.1990000000005
it caused

5088.239 --> 5090.4
okay

5089.44 --> 5092.879999999999
okay

5090.4 --> 5096.0
we're talking about like the the bp oil

5092.88 --> 5096.0
spill event right

5097.28 --> 5101.12
i think i kind of disconnected

5101.36 --> 5107.199
like halfway through that scenario

5103.84 --> 5108.2390000000005
because i was so unbelievably upset by

5107.199 --> 5110.879999999999
that

5108.239 --> 5113.0
like so upset like how it happened like

5110.88 --> 5114.719
i literally felt like these f

5113.0 --> 5117.92
[ __ ]

5114.719 --> 5119.44
corporatist piece of [ __ ] are literally

5117.92 --> 5121.92
just

5119.44 --> 5124.08
blowing up nature

5121.92 --> 5126.88
and then being all smiley faced about it

5124.08 --> 5130.159
like oops oops yeah it was a totally

5126.88 --> 5132.96
irresponsible action that we did

5130.159 --> 5135.839999999999
but we're okay with it what the [ __ ] are

5132.96 --> 5139.199
you gonna do about it you bunch of sheep

5135.84 --> 5142.400000000001
that's what i hated them so much for

5139.199 --> 5145.199
that that i kind of like

5142.4 --> 5149.28
wasn't focused enough to really absorb

5145.199 --> 5149.28
what exactly had been happening there

5149.44 --> 5153.5199999999995
what they actually did i just thought

5151.199 --> 5155.678999999999
like oh my god all that ocean it's all

5153.52 --> 5158.320000000001
dead and terrible

5155.679 --> 5160.4800000000005
if they just left the oil

5158.32 --> 5164.5599999999995
do yeah be there yeah it might have

5160.48 --> 5164.5599999999995
killed some birds but guess what

5164.8 --> 5170.96
it's not like the only time that ever

5166.719 --> 5173.12
happens like oil does sometimes just

5170.96 --> 5174.719
pop up

5173.12 --> 5178.159
it's very rare

5174.719 --> 5181.92
but the ocean can actually deal with raw

5178.159 --> 5184.239
oil because it's raw it's still organic

5181.92 --> 5186.56
it's still kind of organic and there's a

5184.239 --> 5188.159
whole bunch of bacteria and stuff that

5186.56 --> 5190.639
will just

5188.159 --> 5194.159
dissolve it over time right it's but

5190.639 --> 5195.76
yeah due to the amount of oil raw oil

5194.159 --> 5197.5199999999995
that was built

5195.76 --> 5199.76
yeah it would have taken a very long

5197.52 --> 5199.76
time

5200.8 --> 5206.96
but nature does actually is able to

5203.92 --> 5209.679
process raw oil and just turn it into a

5206.96 --> 5212.0
harmless substance is really only when

5209.679 --> 5214.719
we start to crack it and like make

5212.0 --> 5218.639
plastics out of it and all that

5214.719 --> 5221.92
and other toxins those are really

5218.639 --> 5224.92
not very easy to to digest for nature at

5221.92 --> 5224.92
all

5236.239 --> 5239.28
yes i remember here we go again yeah

5238.32 --> 5241.679
yeah

5239.28 --> 5244.0
the garbage that they sprayed over that

5241.679 --> 5246.4800000000005
oil spill when it first happened it was

5244.0 --> 5249.199
so toxic it would also like get in the

5246.48 --> 5251.599999999999
air and smell terrible like a giant

5249.199 --> 5255.759999999999
chemical factory smell really terrible

5251.6 --> 5255.76
and people got all kinds of sick from it

5256.08 --> 5260.96
like serious respiratory issues

5258.719 --> 5263.76
i think people died from that even

5260.96 --> 5263.76
on the long run

5264.4 --> 5267.839999999999
it's terrible time

5282.96 --> 5287.36
yeah i know seeking it's it's always

5284.96 --> 5289.44
tragic to see the birds

5287.36 --> 5291.12
like that

5289.44 --> 5292.159
but

5291.12 --> 5294.5599999999995
like

5292.159 --> 5296.719
oil spills yeah but especially birds

5294.56 --> 5299.120000000001
fish they they're gonna get it it's very

5296.719 --> 5300.719
tragic the the fish are gonna get it

5299.12 --> 5303.679
because they

5300.719 --> 5306.4800000000005
are cut off from the oxygen source and

5303.679 --> 5308.639
yeah oil raw oil even is kind of toxic

5306.48 --> 5311.199
so they're gonna choke

5308.639 --> 5313.36
unfortunately if the old swath is big

5311.199 --> 5315.759999999999
enough it's very tragic

5313.36 --> 5317.04
and it's not good for marine life

5315.76 --> 5319.52
overall

5317.04 --> 5321.76
and the birds too but seriously the

5319.52 --> 5322.719
chemicals they dumped on that time with

5321.76 --> 5324.88
the

5322.719 --> 5327.84
the bp oil spill

5324.88 --> 5332.2390000000005
that was like a hundred times worse

5327.84 --> 5333.84
because that literally carried in land

5332.239 --> 5336.638999999999
and like

5333.84 --> 5339.04
not just like uh they're they're dying

5336.639 --> 5340.88
in the oil and some might escape no just

5339.04 --> 5342.56
everything's dead

5340.88 --> 5348.04
everything's dead

5342.56 --> 5348.04
total poison to death terrible situation

5353.04 --> 5356.96
it has nothing to do with more gallons

5357.52 --> 5364.1990000000005
that was separate

5359.36 --> 5364.199
morgellons is like an inland thing

5387.28 --> 5393.759999999999
holy [ __ ] wireless blues i didn't even

5389.44 --> 5394.719
know that synthetic thing he ate through

5393.76 --> 5397.12
boats

5394.719 --> 5397.12
damn

5397.6 --> 5401.92
well if it's gonna eat through a

5400.08 --> 5404.0
freaking boat

5401.92 --> 5405.4400000000005
that's designed to be able to get

5404.0 --> 5408.56
through the ocean well then it's going

5405.44 --> 5408.5599999999995
to eat through everything

5413.36 --> 5418.719
or well at least probably everything

5415.52 --> 5422.159000000001
somewhat plastic related a lot of boats

5418.719 --> 5422.159
do have plastic on them

5422.48 --> 5426.959999999999
of course yeah

5423.92 --> 5426.96
keep out the water

5427.76 --> 5432.92
it's not so heavy

5429.6 --> 5432.92
as metal

5437.6 --> 5442.400000000001
right yeah yeah here we go again yeah

5439.36 --> 5444.159
yeah conspiracy theory conspiracy theory

5442.4 --> 5446.48
with jesse fentura

5444.159 --> 5448.719
he did a segment about it too a whole

5446.48 --> 5450.4
bunch of segments about morgellons too

5448.719 --> 5453.199
by the way

5450.4 --> 5455.04
and alex jones on there that was a great

5453.199 --> 5458.239
time

5455.04 --> 5461.28
talking about around 2010 i think

5458.239 --> 5463.44
it was a really interesting time

5461.28 --> 5465.759999999999
when then hit just the television the

5463.44 --> 5468.159
regular television had that had alex

5465.76 --> 5470.0
jones on it through a conspiracy theory

5468.159 --> 5472.159
with jessie ventura

5470.0 --> 5474.32
and then at some point he got too much

5472.159 --> 5477.28
pressure and then it turned a little

5474.32 --> 5481.32
kooky

5477.28 --> 5481.32
but that was really interesting

5502.08 --> 5505.84
whole paint crazy

5514.08 --> 5519.12
so i wonder now right

5516.56 --> 5522.56
it's been 10 years

5519.12 --> 5525.44
how's the water over there

5522.56 --> 5526.639
at florida how's the ocean

5525.44 --> 5528.96
is

5526.639 --> 5531.52
is there still anything alive in there

5528.96 --> 5534.8
can you actually just now swim

5531.52 --> 5536.56
safely without getting poisoned

5534.8 --> 5540.56
is there anything still alive in there

5536.56 --> 5542.639
did did it recover over time

5540.56 --> 5545.639
or is it basically still kind of a dead

5542.639 --> 5545.639
zone

5548.08 --> 5552.4
i haven't really asked in

5550.0 --> 5554.08
in years

5552.4 --> 5556.159
because the way it seemed back then it's

5554.08 --> 5558.4
like yeah this is never gonna this is

5556.159 --> 5560.239
like a dead zone forever that's the idea

5558.4 --> 5562.879999999999
that i had but i don't know about the

5560.239 --> 5565.879999999999
reality of it maybe it kind of did

5562.88 --> 5565.88
restore

5574.88 --> 5581.08
the beaches are fake

5577.76 --> 5581.08
what do you mean

5599.28 --> 5603.199
yeah here we go again we just talked

5600.96 --> 5605.44
about that yes

5603.199 --> 5607.28
it was like heavy chemical [ __ ] and you

5605.44 --> 5609.36
could smell it lan inwards a lot of

5607.28 --> 5612.88
report about that people got respiratory

5609.36 --> 5612.88
problems because of that stuff

5613.12 --> 5617.0
like all around florida

5621.28 --> 5626.0
but because it's such a chemical garbage

5623.84 --> 5628.400000000001
thing it and reactive if it's going to

5626.0 --> 5630.4
react with plastic right

5628.4 --> 5632.32
then it's probably just going to keep on

5630.4 --> 5635.04
reacting and at some point just

5632.32 --> 5635.04
neutralize

5639.44 --> 5642.44
hopefully

5646.159 --> 5651.96
the plastic what are you talking about

5648.56 --> 5651.96
the plastic

5658.32 --> 5663.639
they import sand for tourism okay

5674.56 --> 5678.88
yeah i don't know you just brought it up

5676.719 --> 5681.52
here we go again you literally just

5678.88 --> 5681.52
brought it up

5682.159 --> 5688.5599999999995
it's not about the oil spill

5686.159 --> 5692.759999999999
and the chemicals they use to try and

5688.56 --> 5692.76
disperse it and all that

5732.32 --> 5738.88
wow andrew that sounds really bad what

5736.159 --> 5740.5599999999995
but you know if it's like that

5738.88 --> 5743.84
then why don't they just try to

5740.56 --> 5743.84
rearrange the landscape

5744.0 --> 5746.239
and

5748.8 --> 5754.159000000001
instead of like an ocean like make

5752.56 --> 5756.96
like

5754.159 --> 5759.199
get the ocean land inward

5756.96 --> 5761.199
and then kind of cut it off

5759.199 --> 5765.5199999999995
so you can have like a

5761.199 --> 5765.5199999999995
right next to the ocean pool

5766.8 --> 5771.28
and then that way

5768.8 --> 5772.88
like the sand is gonna function that's

5771.28 --> 5775.599999999999
gonna be in between

5772.88 --> 5777.679
the cutoff point is gonna filter it sort

5775.6 --> 5779.1990000000005
of and then you can have like relatively

5777.679 --> 5781.1990000000005
clean beaches

5779.199 --> 5785.28
surrounding that

5781.199 --> 5786.879999999999
in micro inland inward c

5785.28 --> 5789.5199999999995
and kind of keep the

5786.88 --> 5790.8
the real pollution out

5789.52 --> 5792.88
i mean there's not going to be any

5790.8 --> 5796.56
natural life in there

5792.88 --> 5796.56
you got to be careful with algae

5797.679 --> 5801.8
but that might work i don't know

5833.92 --> 5836.92
so

5853.04 --> 5856.4
yeah by the way

5854.48 --> 5859.44
i don't even know about this but like

5856.4 --> 5863.04
what originally caused this bill right

5859.44 --> 5865.759999999999
it was supposedly this giant pressure

5863.04 --> 5867.92
like has it stopped

5865.76 --> 5870.639
or has it literally just been pumping

5867.92 --> 5872.8
out that much oil since the start or has

5870.639 --> 5875.6
it the pressure actually subsided were

5872.8 --> 5879.1990000000005
they eventually able to stop it

5875.6 --> 5879.1990000000005
i don't know i don't remember

5879.76 --> 5883.76
kind of just slipped away into the soup

5882.0 --> 5885.36
of everything else

5883.76 --> 5889.88
i wanted to forget about it because it's

5885.36 --> 5889.88
just terrible terrible idea

5931.6 --> 5935.4800000000005
does anybody here know

5960.159 --> 5967.28
fluoride mining

5963.119 --> 5969.199
no wire blues fluoride as in sodium

5967.28 --> 5972.08
fluoride

5969.199 --> 5974.0
it doesn't get mined they don't mine for

5972.08 --> 5975.84
sodium fluoride they're not [ __ ] out

5974.0 --> 5979.04
of their minds no

5975.84 --> 5982.08
sodium fluoride is a byproduct

5979.04 --> 5987.56
it's a chemical waste by-product

5982.08 --> 5987.5599999999995
from actually mining for other things

6001.84 --> 6004.32
i don't know if i

6003.44 --> 6006.879999999999
can't

6004.32 --> 6009.599999999999
completely recall like what it's related

6006.88 --> 6013.4400000000005
to at this time

6009.6 --> 6013.4400000000005
what's it again it's like

6014.0 --> 6018.56
they get it

6015.679 --> 6022.96
coal has some of it sometimes

6018.56 --> 6025.84
then they have to extract it out

6022.96 --> 6030.8
it was also a side product from chemical

6025.84 --> 6030.8
industry involving artificial fertilizer

6030.88 --> 6037.119
and i think like with

6033.84 --> 6038.400000000001
uranium mining tools aluminium right

6037.119 --> 6041.36
right yeah yeah

6038.4 --> 6043.04
but it's a byproduct most of it

6041.36 --> 6045.679
or all of it it's always a vibrant they

6043.04 --> 6047.84
don't literally go out and mine for

6045.679 --> 6052.119
sodium fluoride they don't go mine the

6047.84 --> 6052.119000000001
poison oh the poison is a by-product

6098.719 --> 6102.84
what the hell george sanford

6107.199 --> 6115.5289999999995
why isn't that fixed like why

6112.41 --> 6115.5289999999995
[Music]

6140.48 --> 6143.48
okay

6179.28 --> 6184.639
oh well george sanford before that the

6182.0 --> 6189.159
drinking water escapade

6184.639 --> 6189.159000000001
they also used it as rat poison

6190.08 --> 6194.48
like there there it was like a

6192.56 --> 6196.719
yeah poisonous waste

6194.48 --> 6198.638999999999
so people would have bags of that [ __ ]

6196.719 --> 6201.76
because there is just plenty there's

6198.639 --> 6203.92
enough sodium fluoride but it would

6201.76 --> 6205.6
originally be used as rat poison until

6203.92 --> 6208.47
they replaced it

6205.6 --> 6211.569
because it was just too polluting

6208.47 --> 6211.569
[Music]

6212.96 --> 6217.4800000000005
don't forget they also put it in

6214.48 --> 6217.48
toothpaste

6219.44 --> 6224.638999999999
and that's why fluoridated toothpaste

6222.8 --> 6225.360000000001
if you swallow

6224.639 --> 6227.84
just

6225.36 --> 6230.32
this amount of toothpaste

6227.84 --> 6234.400000000001
officially you have to warn your doctor

6230.32 --> 6238.119
this is serious because it's it's

6234.4 --> 6238.119
it's just poison

6249.92 --> 6255.119
all right wireless wire blues

6253.199 --> 6257.599999999999
well i

6255.119 --> 6259.119
myself have been using

6257.6 --> 6261.1990000000005
like filtered

6259.119 --> 6263.28
elements

6261.199 --> 6266.0
to really filter any type of tap water

6263.28 --> 6268.639
for over 10 years now not they don't put

6266.0 --> 6271.44
fluoride in water here

6268.639 --> 6272.56
but it's still better quality water if

6271.44 --> 6274.4
you do that

6272.56 --> 6277.360000000001
even if it's not fluoridated water

6274.4 --> 6277.36
you're trying to filter

6279.199 --> 6284.159
in some regions in the netherlands they

6281.36 --> 6285.759999999999
do put things like chlorine in water

6284.159 --> 6287.839999999999
because the water quality is not all

6285.76 --> 6292.0
that

6287.84 --> 6292.0
and it does filter out that as well so

6294.0 --> 6297.84
but yeah thank god it's not allowed to

6296.0 --> 6300.639
be put in the water here that would be

6297.84 --> 6303.04
absolutely devastating like for nature

6300.639 --> 6305.84
it would be absolutely devastating if we

6303.04 --> 6306.88
did that because the entire country is

6305.84 --> 6310.08
water

6306.88 --> 6311.76
so if you're going to put fluoride then

6310.08 --> 6314.08
through that it's literally the

6311.76 --> 6316.0
fluoride's going to get in everything

6314.08 --> 6320.159
it's just going to be in the groundwater

6316.0 --> 6320.159
eventually and that's just devastating

6323.36 --> 6326.36
right

6335.28 --> 6339.44
let's let it sit out yeah

6339.84 --> 6343.0
all right
