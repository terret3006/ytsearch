good morning

66.159 --> 70.0

and membership system join button

94.799 --> 99.68
they'll be much appreciated

98.079 --> 101.83999999999999
so

99.68 --> 101.84
yeah

102.96 --> 107.36
today is

104.88 --> 109.36
different

107.36 --> 110.88
it's not fully clouded but it's

109.36 --> 113.04
definitely not

110.88 --> 114.79899999999999
bright and clear

113.04 --> 118.64
overall

114.799 --> 118.64
some interesting looking clouds there

121.52 --> 125.719
it seems to be quite windy

128.319 --> 134.23899999999998
and yeah it's not a surprise there's

130.879 --> 135.35999999999999
literally fireworks going constantly

134.239 --> 138.64000000000001
right now

135.36 --> 143.0
because it's the last day of the year

138.64 --> 143.0
the calendar year that is

146.879 --> 153.04
at least it seems to be

149.52 --> 153.04000000000002
it seems like it's going to be dry

153.44 --> 157.56
let me open that up for a second

160.239 --> 162.56
all right

164.08 --> 166.64000000000001
hello

165.2 --> 168.879
dibble

166.64 --> 172.79999999999998
74 first in chat

168.879 --> 175.44
jeff gas had seeking star wars

172.8 --> 175.44
good to see you

180.08 --> 187.56
it is friday the

182.84 --> 187.56
31st of december 2021

187.92 --> 193.44
i'm gonna do a little new year's

191.599 --> 195.51899999999998
mini show

193.44 --> 197.35999999999999
a while show just basically looking at

195.519 --> 200.239
fireworks and

197.36 --> 203.12
drinking a beer and all that

200.239 --> 205.44
like i do every year since i started my

203.12 --> 205.44
channel

208.959 --> 214.31900000000002
and

210.239 --> 216.799
yeah gonna enjoy all the fireworks

214.319 --> 220.319
which are supposedly illegal

216.799 --> 220.31900000000002
and nobody gives a [ __ ]

220.799 --> 224.84
because she yeah you're not gonna take

222.72 --> 228.0
that away from

224.84 --> 229.599
us like

228.0 --> 232.56
dutch people

229.599 --> 235.67999999999998
need fireworks

232.56 --> 235.68
because it is like a

235.84 --> 240.68
historical enactment to remember

240.72 --> 244.64
the war

242.239 --> 246.4
our first ancestors of this country had

244.64 --> 248.39999999999998
to go through

246.4 --> 249.92000000000002
to basically secure it as their own

248.4 --> 252.31900000000002
country

249.92 --> 255.51899999999998
and that was in a time when there was

252.319 --> 258.56
like mortars

255.519 --> 261.12
and all that constantly

258.56 --> 262.4
explosions everywhere

261.12 --> 264.72
so yeah

262.4 --> 266.56
for me i see new year's eve like a

264.72 --> 269.04
reenactment of

266.56 --> 271.52
how my country got started so i take it

269.04 --> 274.96000000000004
very personal like that

271.52 --> 277.28
yeah you're not going to take that away

274.96 --> 279.919
government whatever the [ __ ] you think

277.28 --> 284.08
you are and i'm really sorry if your

279.919 --> 285.59999999999997
fragile little gremlin dog can't handle

284.08 --> 286.639
it it's going to [ __ ] all over your

285.6 --> 289.44
carpet

286.639 --> 292.72
well you might just want to get him a

289.44 --> 294.4
soundproof room then

292.72 --> 295.84000000000003
you know

294.4 --> 299.52
instead of

295.84 --> 301.59999999999997
trying to take away dutch tradition

299.52 --> 303.919
because you're whiners

301.6 --> 303.91900000000004
anyway

304.24 --> 306.479
yeah

308.08 --> 311.8
i'm feeling pretty good

311.84 --> 315.67999999999995
but i had like a late night

314.32 --> 317.759
again

315.68 --> 320.16
like it was crazy

317.759 --> 321.44
how that worked i was just like playing

320.16 --> 324.32000000000005
a game

321.44 --> 326.88
staring at the clock and like yeah it's

324.32 --> 328.56
too late and i'm just not gonna stop i

326.88 --> 330.4
just couldn't

328.56 --> 333.12
get it through to myself even

330.4 --> 336.71999999999997
consciously it's just like no no i'm not

333.12 --> 339.84000000000003
going to go to bed now makes no sense

336.72 --> 339.84000000000003
just wouldn't stop

341.039 --> 346.24
so yeah

343.68 --> 348.16
but i i do not feel like

346.24 --> 351.12
particularly

348.16 --> 353.84000000000003
like a lack of rest or anything

351.12 --> 353.84000000000003
it's kind of odd

355.36 --> 360.16
so i feel just fine

357.28 --> 360.15999999999997
hungry though

378.88 --> 382.4
anyway how are you guys doing

387.759 --> 391.84000000000003
yesterday's stream was super long

392.08 --> 396.52
and i gave it a title afterwards

416.4 --> 421.23999999999995
i'm surprised that the lack of comments

422.479 --> 426.24
i'm used to getting more comments

426.639 --> 430.88
like at least some thing maybe

428.96 --> 432.15999999999997
everybody's just preoccupied with their

430.88 --> 437.4
own [ __ ]

432.16 --> 437.40000000000003
[ __ ] situation whatever out there

445.28 --> 452.84
oh wow seeking star wars that's

449.52 --> 452.84
that's intense

465.68 --> 471.199
yeah yeah lost history series is very

468.8 --> 473.12
intense so

471.199 --> 477.08000000000004
that's kind of surprising you actually

473.12 --> 477.08
got him to watch that

481.919 --> 488.44
good on you

484.56 --> 488.44
pretty heavy on him

512.399 --> 518.36
the mechanics of the power stations what

520.08 --> 523.08
what

534.959 --> 539.92
okay

536.64 --> 539.92
hypersonic speed

543.839 --> 549.519
how is it the fastest or is it

546.959 --> 551.1199999999999
the fastest that technology can

549.519 --> 553.839
currently

551.12 --> 555.6
take the impact from because yeah what i

553.839 --> 557.44
know

555.6 --> 559.279
is speeds the more speed the more

557.44 --> 562.48
vibration

559.279 --> 565.4399999999999
from the turbulence and like it's all

562.48 --> 568.08
about the ability to basically take the

565.44 --> 568.08
impact

568.399 --> 572.16
from the turbulence

570.48 --> 574.88
that's what the speeds are all about

572.16 --> 578.7199999999999
because if you go faster it just

574.88 --> 578.72
it just breaks apart and explodes

578.88 --> 586.399
so it's all about how much vibration

582.72 --> 590.76
can something impact and

586.399 --> 590.76
how aerodynamic is it

591.519 --> 594.16
effectively

597.68 --> 602.16
i'm kind of surprised that 38

600.72 --> 604.72
3800

602.16 --> 606.079
is the fastest

604.72 --> 607.6800000000001
that they can get

606.079 --> 609.92
to i thought it would be faster than

607.68 --> 609.92
that

613.279 --> 617.8389999999999
now of course in outer space they can

615.36 --> 620.399
claim to go much much faster because

617.839 --> 622.32
there's no friction of the earth

620.399 --> 625.32
yeah unfortunately that doesn't really

622.32 --> 625.32
exist

632.8 --> 637.1999999999999
thrust is

634.079 --> 638.64
500 miles per hour on a rocket

637.2 --> 641.6400000000001
what

638.64 --> 641.64
okay

646.079 --> 648.959
hello elise g

650.0 --> 653.0
wrath

655.19 --> 658.389
[Music]

662.72 --> 666.5600000000001
okay but jeff gas said that doesn't

664.48 --> 668.8000000000001
really make any sense what you just said

666.56 --> 671.1999999999999
first you're saying

668.8 --> 673.68
3 800 is the fastest and then you say

671.2 --> 679.12
yeah but on the rockets is 5 000. okay

673.68 --> 679.12
so 3800 is not the fastest then

679.36 --> 686.909
like which is it it's kind of weird

683.47 --> 686.909
[Music]

700.48 --> 704.399
our resistance stops full speed to 30.

703.519 --> 705.44
okay

704.399 --> 707.04
all right

705.44 --> 709.9200000000001
that's interested

707.04 --> 709.92
that's interesting

713.839 --> 718.0790000000001
so

715.36 --> 722.72
yeah then it's safe to say that rockets

718.079 --> 724.88
don't go actually 5000 miles per hour

722.72 --> 726.0790000000001
they theoretically might

724.88 --> 727.8389999999999
they stop

726.079 --> 731.2399999999999
going through atmosphere but that

727.839 --> 731.24
doesn't happen

731.44 --> 735.519
unless you're declaring okay there's

734.24 --> 737.92
certain

735.519 --> 740.399
super high altitude where there's lower

737.92 --> 744.16
pressure where they can reach up to 5

740.399 --> 746.56
000 miles per hour or something

744.16 --> 748.959
so nothing close to the earth it would

746.56 --> 750.3199999999999
have to be kind of far away within the

748.959 --> 752.2399999999999
containment

750.32 --> 754.0
and then you could go a little faster

752.24 --> 755.6
because there's less friction if that's

754.0 --> 758.92
the claim okay

755.6 --> 758.9200000000001
i get it

763.839 --> 767.0400000000001
anyway interesting to know

768.24 --> 775.839
that air resistance pretty much

771.36 --> 775.839
caps the speed at 3800

776.56 --> 780.3199999999999
and ludicrous speed go

781.12 --> 786.68
yep

783.44 --> 786.6800000000001
hey kevlar

794.04 --> 800.1999999999999
spacex i see what the hell are you

796.8 --> 800.1999999999999
talking about

864.8 --> 867.92
hello adam l

869.279 --> 874.079
yeah happy

870.399 --> 876.56
new year as in solar cycle as in not an

874.079 --> 876.56
object

878.56 --> 883.7199999999999
okay that's not yeah get up

887.76 --> 891.76
yeah just don't tell me what to do ever

890.959 --> 894.6389999999999
yeah

891.76 --> 896.3199999999999
like if you're gonna be oh it's a joke

894.639 --> 899.6800000000001
flat earth it's so funny that's one

896.32 --> 902.72
thing but yeah if you're gonna

899.68 --> 906.04
don't tell me what to [ __ ] do

902.72 --> 906.0400000000001
just don't

921.79 --> 926.68
[Music]

923.68 --> 926.68
hmm

933.29 --> 936.4599999999999
[Music]

938.88 --> 941.8389999999999
ah

990.32 --> 993.32
right

999.04 --> 1002.56
oh you went

1000.24 --> 1005.5600000000001
to see the new matrix

1002.56 --> 1005.56
okay

1017.839 --> 1022.0400000000001
when what what do you think

1045.28 --> 1052.2
hey ryan arthurton

1048.72 --> 1052.2
good to see you

1059.679 --> 1062.679
okay

1095.919 --> 1101.72
okay so you're not gonna tell us

1098.24 --> 1101.72
okay fine

1110.08 --> 1115.1999999999998
man i really hope this new year i'm just

1112.72 --> 1115.2
not gonna

1115.28 --> 1122.039
feel compelled to stay up as late

1118.32 --> 1122.039
it kind of sucks

1132.08 --> 1137.0
your tolerance has changed with age

1137.76 --> 1140.64
well

1139.44 --> 1142.88
you think

1140.64 --> 1145.679
or maybe

1142.88 --> 1147.679
the new one is just freaking gay i don't

1145.679 --> 1148.8400000000001
know i haven't really seen it i just

1147.679 --> 1153.039
know

1148.84 --> 1155.84
that i don't like keanu reeves radiance

1153.039 --> 1158.48
anymore in the first movie

1155.84 --> 1160.0
he radiated like a real

1158.48 --> 1162.48
blank slate

1160.0 --> 1164.72
hahaha that's funny right because he

1162.48 --> 1168.64
typically is like that well guess what

1164.72 --> 1168.64
it worked really well for that movie

1170.48 --> 1175.039
but he's not like that anymore

1173.36 --> 1179.4399999999998
he's like

1175.039 --> 1181.84
an overcompensating gay or lesbian as

1179.44 --> 1184.64
own benjamin says it i

1181.84 --> 1185.6789999999999
can't read i don't like your radiance at

1184.64 --> 1189.1200000000001
all

1185.679 --> 1191.039
like in almost anything

1189.12 --> 1193.4399999999998
there's something

1191.039 --> 1195.76
wrong

1193.44 --> 1200.0800000000002
there's something polluted inside you

1195.76 --> 1200.08
and it's visible for everybody to see

1202.24 --> 1205.28
i haven't seen this one yet

1204.48 --> 1207.679
but

1205.28 --> 1211.9189999999999
just from the trailers i would already

1207.679 --> 1214.72
get that very very strong sensation

1211.919 --> 1218.7990000000002
like he's become overly aware

1214.72 --> 1221.679
of his special boy status socially

1218.799 --> 1224.1589999999999
and he just can't let it go

1221.679 --> 1225.76
he can't be the blank slate you need to

1224.159 --> 1227.6000000000001
actually be

1225.76 --> 1230.64
to be neo

1227.6 --> 1230.6399999999999
can't do it anymore

1232.799 --> 1236.1589999999999
or anything i'd say

1234.72 --> 1239.28
because now it's just going to be

1236.159 --> 1242.24
radiating special boys

1239.28 --> 1244.24
feelings and it sucks

1242.24 --> 1249.0
like that's not what we want to project

1244.24 --> 1249.0
on that's not what we want to compare to

1253.919 --> 1259.1200000000001
it felt like the trans version of the

1256.559 --> 1260.799
first movie oh god

1259.12 --> 1263.6
well yeah

1260.799 --> 1265.36
could be

1263.6 --> 1268.559
that's what everybody's or well yeah

1265.36 --> 1268.559
you've actually seen it

1275.76 --> 1278.8799999999999
it was a bit forced

1281.52 --> 1284.6399999999999
well i'm not surprised

1287.76 --> 1292.559
money crab movie well or

1294.72 --> 1298.799
yeah well that would be a money crap

1296.559 --> 1300.1589999999999
like cashing in on

1298.799 --> 1303.1589999999999
the matrix

1300.159 --> 1303.159
cosmology

1304.159 --> 1306.48
right

1307.679 --> 1310.24
but

1308.48 --> 1312.159
i guess i wouldn't know because i

1310.24 --> 1313.52
haven't seen it but from what i've heard

1312.159 --> 1317.5200000000002
and suspected

1313.52 --> 1320.1589999999999
not really adding a whole lot as in

1317.52 --> 1323.12
wanted things things that are actually

1320.159 --> 1323.1200000000001
good to add

1323.28 --> 1325.76
so yeah

1326.32 --> 1332.12
identify is as nia

1328.799 --> 1332.12
that's terrible

1338.32 --> 1343.12
who pays money to watch programming

1341.84 --> 1345.1999999999998
nobody

1343.12 --> 1347.36
but there's plenty of money who plenty

1345.2 --> 1351.28
of people

1347.36 --> 1353.28
who will pay money to make you watch

1351.28 --> 1355.039
programming

1353.28 --> 1357.12
huh

1355.039 --> 1360.84
i considered that

1357.12 --> 1360.84
that angle of approach

1371.2 --> 1375.679
did he

1372.4 --> 1378.679
his what that's not a sentence yes jeff

1375.679 --> 1378.679
gassett

1390.64 --> 1393.64
okay

1414.72 --> 1419.679
looks to be a set up for a sequel right

1420.88 --> 1424.24
well

1421.919 --> 1424.24
yeah

1427.679 --> 1431.679
oh

1428.48 --> 1436.4
yeah well maybe

1431.679 --> 1439.52
maybe this new matrix is kind of like

1436.4 --> 1441.919
they're gonna do a hobbit to their lord

1439.52 --> 1445.2
of the rings kind of situation right

1441.919 --> 1446.3200000000002
remember the hobbit movies well

1445.2 --> 1448.0800000000002
the hobbit

1446.32 --> 1450.1589999999999
compared to lord of the rings is like

1448.08 --> 1452.96
this tiny book

1450.159 --> 1454.5590000000002
children's book right well they made a

1452.96 --> 1456.4
full-blown

1454.559 --> 1458.08
trilogy of it

1456.4 --> 1460.48
that's just as big of the lord of the

1458.08 --> 1463.1999999999998
rings which is kind of ridiculous even

1460.48 --> 1465.6
though it was pretty good actually in

1463.2 --> 1468.24
retrospect surprisingly right

1465.6 --> 1468.24
well maybe

1469.76 --> 1473.279
the uh

1470.799 --> 1475.2
wachowski sisters thought oh well it's

1473.279 --> 1478.159
just one right the other one stayed out

1475.2 --> 1482.24
of it it's just like oh we want our

1478.159 --> 1486.2
hobbit giant trilogy too

1482.24 --> 1486.2
so they just made more

1486.4 --> 1493.919
but yeah this wasn't part of the

1489.12 --> 1495.9189999999999
original writing plan pretty sure

1493.919 --> 1500.6000000000001
like the hobbit was because of it was

1495.919 --> 1500.6000000000001
actually a prequel to lord of the rings

1540.48 --> 1545.919
john wick is how neo identifies in his

1542.799 --> 1548.24
mind well that's terrible

1545.919 --> 1548.24
that's

1548.88 --> 1553.2
a terrible

1550.799 --> 1555.6
terrible

1553.2 --> 1557.6000000000001
movie decision

1555.6 --> 1559.039
or just acting

1557.6 --> 1562.3999999999999
like no

1559.039 --> 1564.96
no neo isn't freaking john wick

1562.4 --> 1567.76
you idiot

1564.96 --> 1569.279
nothing like that was he anything like

1567.76 --> 1571.76
john wick

1569.279 --> 1572.64
in the trilogy anything at all

1571.76 --> 1577.039
no

1572.64 --> 1577.039
not a hint not a hint

1578.32 --> 1583.039
john wick is a

1579.919 --> 1584.4
[ __ ] drama queen that's trapped in

1583.039 --> 1587.919
like an

1584.4 --> 1590.48
a pointless death spiral situation it's

1587.919 --> 1592.4
completely different the entire angle of

1590.48 --> 1595.4
approach the atmosphere is completely

1592.4 --> 1595.4
different

1608.64 --> 1612.72
ugh

1609.84 --> 1614.9599999999998
anyway yeah i haven't seen the movie but

1612.72 --> 1614.96
yeah

1616.08 --> 1618.799
from what you're saying

1618.0 --> 1620.08
yeah

1618.799 --> 1624.2
i pretty much

1620.08 --> 1624.1999999999998
hit the nail on the head

1628.48 --> 1634.24
they attempted like the old movie sort

1631.039 --> 1636.8799999999999
of but then they poured in some little

1634.24 --> 1639.2
special boy juice to make it all

1636.88 --> 1643.6000000000001
terrible

1639.2 --> 1643.6000000000001
so that neo isn't actually neo

1644.0 --> 1649.12
and that everything is like overly

1646.48 --> 1651.1200000000001
conscious of how special it is based on

1649.12 --> 1653.12
the original matrix which is so

1651.12 --> 1656.0
legendary right

1653.12 --> 1661.08
totally overly self-aware which means

1656.0 --> 1661.08
not focused which means a failure

1677.279 --> 1680.799
special girl no

1679.679 --> 1683.1200000000001
no

1680.799 --> 1684.08
doesn't don't care doesn't work like

1683.12 --> 1686.32
that

1684.08 --> 1687.6789999999999
it's special boy

1686.32 --> 1689.52
special boy

1687.679 --> 1693.76
doesn't even have anything to do with

1689.52 --> 1693.76
gender it's just the way you say it

1693.919 --> 1699.8400000000001
and because it's mostly boys that do act

1697.36 --> 1699.84
like this

1701.919 --> 1706.64
i don't care what the [ __ ] you associate

1704.159 --> 1709.2
with it's special boy

1706.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
and that's it there's no option to

1709.2 --> 1711.8400000000001
change that

1716.559 --> 1722.6399999999999
you can shove your gender fluidity up

1719.6 --> 1724.6399999999999
your ass which everybody has has an ass

1722.64 --> 1728.0800000000002
to shove it up into

1724.64 --> 1728.0800000000002
no matter what you think you are

1737.039 --> 1743.12
they mock the matrix in the movie yeah

1739.279 --> 1743.12
that's what i've heard too terrible

1744.159 --> 1746.64
evil

1749.44 --> 1752.96
right it's like almost like cutting your

1751.12 --> 1754.8799999999999
own dick off

1752.96 --> 1757.2
ironically

1754.88 --> 1759.6000000000001
so yeah in a way it's all super

1757.2 --> 1762.64
predictable right have a success then

1759.6 --> 1764.48
you completely corrupt to the core

1762.64 --> 1767.3600000000001
you decide oh you're trans now you're a

1764.48 --> 1769.48
special boy and then

1767.36 --> 1772.7199999999998
you literally

1769.48 --> 1776.3990000000001
sacrifice your own glorious creation on

1772.72 --> 1777.76
the altar of satan to appease

1776.399 --> 1780.799
your

1777.76 --> 1782.48
derangement syndrome yeah that's what

1780.799 --> 1786.84
it's felt like

1782.48 --> 1786.84
like i knew it was gonna happen

1798.06 --> 1801.349
[Music]

1803.44 --> 1806.64
yeah

1804.559 --> 1808.48
not a freaking what you askies should

1806.64 --> 1810.3200000000002
have just jumped off a roof after they

1808.48 --> 1813.44
finished the matrix iii

1810.32 --> 1815.36
spared us all the misery that would come

1813.44 --> 1819.52
forth from them afterward

1815.36 --> 1819.52
literally should have freaking ended it

1821.2 --> 1825.52
at least your legacy would remain as

1823.679 --> 1828.5590000000002
glorious as it is

1825.52 --> 1833.1589999999999
instead of having you rape it

1828.559 --> 1833.1589999999999
compulsively like a demon

1841.6 --> 1845.52
you know patrick harris is good okay

1849.76 --> 1854.32
not entirely sure who that is

1853.16 --> 1857.1200000000001
[Music]

1854.32 --> 1857.12
googling it

1862.24 --> 1866.0
all right

1863.519 --> 1869.32
what he's in that movie

1866.0 --> 1869.32
that's weird

1878.64 --> 1883.3600000000001
well not particularly a fan of that

1881.12 --> 1886.36
person so

1883.36 --> 1886.36
fine

1894.159 --> 1897.159
so

1908.64 --> 1914.48
he's gay they're all gay

1910.96 --> 1914.48
or well most of them are

1916.399 --> 1921.4399999999998
as in people in hollywood yeah they're

1918.32 --> 1925.4399999999998
all gay it's terrible

1921.44 --> 1928.3990000000001
it's literally marcus satan effectively

1925.44 --> 1931.2
like that's what it becomes

1928.399 --> 1934.9599999999998
oh what it's only gay yeah yeah only

1931.2 --> 1937.919
satan it's only satan guys only satan

1934.96 --> 1940.919
it's okay it's not that bad it's only

1937.919 --> 1940.919
satan

1949.6 --> 1954.48
it's funny though that pretty much

1951.76 --> 1955.44
everybody i don't even know

1954.48 --> 1957.279
them

1955.44 --> 1959.2
you can just see like

1957.279 --> 1961.039
i don't really like this person oh he

1959.2 --> 1962.3990000000001
turns out to be gay oh wow what a

1961.039 --> 1963.36
surprise

1962.399 --> 1965.4399999999998
yeah

1963.36 --> 1968.32
what a surprise

1965.44 --> 1968.3200000000002
i didn't know that

1968.559 --> 1975.519
but yeah that's usually how that works

1972.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
if you're gay i don't like you i'm sorry

1975.519 --> 1979.519
i just don't

1977.84 --> 1981.6
i might be able to

1979.519 --> 1984.559
deal with you

1981.6 --> 1986.8799999999999
but i'm never gonna like you why because

1984.559 --> 1988.8799999999999
you're gay i don't even have to know

1986.88 --> 1992.159
that about you

1988.88 --> 1994.48
if you are i will feel it and i will not

1992.159 --> 1997.44
like you

1994.48 --> 1997.44
because it's wrong

2000.72 --> 2004.32
and i

2001.679 --> 2007.3600000000001
feel that i feel the essence of your

2004.32 --> 2010.1589999999999
corruption i don't even have to know

2007.36 --> 2014.12
what you like or what you're into

2010.159 --> 2014.1200000000001
i will just feel it

2021.679 --> 2025.519
theater experience

2023.36 --> 2028.08
okay so the action part i take it was

2025.519 --> 2031.08
pretty good

2028.08 --> 2031.08
lsg

2044.64 --> 2049.9190000000003
whenever i watch movies i look for the

2047.039 --> 2053.159
shots they take at fv oh right mentions

2049.919 --> 2053.1589999999997
and all that

2061.28 --> 2065.9190000000003
and was there any drop of that i don't

2063.04 --> 2067.919
think so i think they have enough like

2065.919 --> 2070.3199999999997
cosmology

2067.919 --> 2070.3199999999997
things

2070.639 --> 2076.3990000000003
right matrix not matrix i think they

2072.96 --> 2078.639
have enough paradigm switches like

2076.399 --> 2081.1189999999997
straight on their hands

2078.639 --> 2083.119
to get involved with flat earth to make

2081.119 --> 2085.52
mention of that because it's not the

2083.119 --> 2088.3990000000003
type of focus it's like

2085.52 --> 2092.159
in the matrix effectively what that does

2088.399 --> 2093.7599999999998
what it did to me the original matrix

2092.159 --> 2097.04
is basically

2093.76 --> 2098.8
project your inner world onto the

2097.04 --> 2099.92
physical world

2098.8 --> 2102.32
like

2099.92 --> 2104.88
imagining yeah we are now in an

2102.32 --> 2108.88
imagination that's being projected from

2104.88 --> 2112.2400000000002
the inside through computers onto my

2108.88 --> 2113.6800000000003
brain basically the matrix

2112.24 --> 2117.2
when you realize that you have a

2113.68 --> 2118.7999999999997
different point of view psychologically

2117.2 --> 2120.8799999999997
right

2118.8 --> 2122.88
it wouldn't really work did like drop a

2120.88 --> 2126.32
flat earth in such a scenario because

2122.88 --> 2126.32
you're too focused already

2127.68 --> 2131.5989999999997
if you wanted to secretly slip it

2129.599 --> 2134.079
through a like right

2131.599 --> 2136.96
well if you're in another movie where

2134.079 --> 2139.92
it's not about a matrix it's not about

2136.96 --> 2142.64
something being projected on your brain

2139.92 --> 2145.76
making you think it's real it's just a

2142.64 --> 2146.64
movie with movie cosmology in space and

2145.76 --> 2149.599
all that

2146.64 --> 2153.44
well then you can very easily drop into

2149.599 --> 2154.32
it because your focus is not

2153.44 --> 2156.839
on

2154.32 --> 2159.6800000000003
real world fake

2156.839 --> 2162.0789999999997
world so you can

2159.68 --> 2164.56
grab hold of that moment when you're

2162.079 --> 2167.28
watching it in a different way

2164.56 --> 2171.2
and basically use it like a trinket

2167.28 --> 2172.96
well if you did that in a matrix setup

2171.2 --> 2176.64
where it's already really focused it

2172.96 --> 2179.2
would be like it a key

2176.64 --> 2181.839
unwittingly like that wouldn't yeah the

2179.2 --> 2185.5989999999997
movie makers pro of the matrix don't

2181.839 --> 2187.839
want you to become flat earthers i bet

2185.599 --> 2190.079
at this point

2187.839 --> 2192.48
so just doing that would just

2190.079 --> 2195.28
like immediately hand you the key like

2192.48 --> 2196.48
yeah the earth is flat like even if

2195.28 --> 2198.8
you're

2196.48 --> 2201.359
not really ready for that

2198.8 --> 2203.119
because it's the matrix because it

2201.359 --> 2206.0
already makes you focus on the

2203.119 --> 2208.1600000000003
realization that a computer is basically

2206.0 --> 2210.48
projecting something into your brain

2208.16 --> 2214.7999999999997
through your imagination

2210.48 --> 2217.359
right so you're already overly focused

2214.8 --> 2217.3590000000004
on that

2227.839 --> 2234.32
oh wait did you say it was the worst

2232.079 --> 2236.32
as such said worth

2234.32 --> 2239.6800000000003
is it was it that bad

2236.32 --> 2241.6800000000003
no what the action was the action even

2239.68 --> 2244.3199999999997
was the action not worth it like can't

2241.68 --> 2246.56
you cut out like all the stupid blah

2244.32 --> 2247.599
blah blah moments like all the freaking

2246.56 --> 2249.2
gay

2247.599 --> 2254.2000000000003
and then still have a pretty decent

2249.2 --> 2254.2
action movie or did they even ruin that

2257.359 --> 2265.2799999999997
too fast flashing across this oh really

2262.4 --> 2265.28
no slow-mo

2268.0 --> 2271.0
what

2272.64 --> 2277.04
what the [ __ ] why wouldn't they do

2274.8 --> 2279.52
the slo-mo that the whole slow-mo is the

2277.04 --> 2282.52
matrix freaking invention they invented

2279.52 --> 2282.52
it

2291.52 --> 2293.839
that's

2294.96 --> 2298.7200000000003
right so far okay

2296.96 --> 2303.2400000000002
that's yeah

2298.72 --> 2303.24
disappointing but to be expected

2322.98 --> 2326.09
[Music]

2330.32 --> 2333.3590000000004
bullet time was used differently in this

2332.32 --> 2336.3590000000004
one

2333.359 --> 2336.359
hmm

2350.4 --> 2353.96
what they market

2356.4 --> 2360.599
that's

2357.2 --> 2360.5989999999997
just ridiculous

2378.64 --> 2382.7999999999997
i mean like the whole evading bullets

2381.52 --> 2385.04
and [ __ ]

2382.8 --> 2387.52
when neo did it himself in the matrix

2385.04 --> 2391.44
one it's like one of the most

2387.52 --> 2394.0
fascinating inspiring things

2391.44 --> 2396.56
i had seen at the time

2394.0 --> 2397.92
like that's really

2396.56 --> 2400.24
amazing

2397.92 --> 2401.6800000000003
the idea of that and how it looked it

2400.24 --> 2404.4799999999996
was very conv

2401.68 --> 2407.2
to then mock what you made many years

2404.48 --> 2410.2
ago it's just dude what the [ __ ] are you

2407.2 --> 2410.2
doing

2423.04 --> 2425.839
anyway

2428.16 --> 2432.24
yeah well i'm probably going to watch it

2430.24 --> 2433.9199999999996
at some point not looking forward to it

2432.24 --> 2437.16
i'm probably going to be really pissed

2433.92 --> 2437.16
off afterwards

2456.079 --> 2459.6800000000003
hey len lenox

2462.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
what have you missed uh we were right

2465.2 --> 2470.48
now talking about the matrix

2467.839 --> 2472.7999999999997
the new one

2470.48 --> 2474.8
and how much it sucks

2472.8 --> 2478.4
apparently i haven't watched it myself

2474.8 --> 2480.8
but have did not have a good

2478.4 --> 2483.359
feel for that like i thought even the

2480.8 --> 2487.28
trailer sucked

2483.359 --> 2487.2799999999997
it's like neo's all wrong

2487.76 --> 2495.44
like that's not neo anymore

2491.119 --> 2497.92
that's a overly high paid terrible actor

2495.44 --> 2500.0
who's unfortunately no longer a blank

2497.92 --> 2502.319
slate which is what made him so great in

2500.0 --> 2504.24
the first matrix movies now he's overly

2502.319 --> 2506.56
self-aware that he's neo that he's a

2504.24 --> 2511.4399999999996
special boy that he's john wick and all

2506.56 --> 2517.0
that [ __ ] so he just radiates gross

2511.44 --> 2517.0
gross overly self-indulgent gross

2535.119 --> 2539.28
oh [ __ ] you haven't even watched the

2536.72 --> 2542.0
whole movie yet

2539.28 --> 2542.0
oh man

2558.079 --> 2564.92
yay nathan's putting out a link

2560.8 --> 2564.92
so that means a live show

2565.28 --> 2570.4
you did watch the whole thing

2568.48 --> 2572.96
oh you're not gonna say the whole thing

2570.4 --> 2576.359
was [ __ ] right okay yeah that's that was

2572.96 --> 2576.359
very confusing

2584.319 --> 2590.24
right so it wasn't all [ __ ]

2586.48 --> 2592.56
but it was [ __ ] so it's like

2590.24 --> 2596.24
could it be compared with wow you had

2592.56 --> 2599.119
like the amazing relationship

2596.24 --> 2602.24
say 10 years ago more like it was

2599.119 --> 2604.8
absolutely stellar

2602.24 --> 2607.68
but like yeah then it moved on

2604.8 --> 2609.92
like it broke up

2607.68 --> 2611.839
and they changed and now we have the

2609.92 --> 2614.319
opportunity to get back to them but

2611.839 --> 2615.92
they're just changed and they're not

2614.319 --> 2618.56
the same

2615.92 --> 2621.839
like at all

2618.56 --> 2621.839
it's like that isn't it

2622.24 --> 2627.04
it's like this could have been amazing

2624.319 --> 2627.04
but it isn't

2629.119 --> 2634.7200000000003
it's spoiled

2631.119 --> 2637.119
it's polluted the well is poison

2634.72 --> 2639.7599999999998
it doesn't work anymore because

2637.119 --> 2644.96
there's no more honest

2639.76 --> 2644.96
clear open intention of the awakening

2646.8 --> 2652.2400000000002
they just want to turn it into a gay

2649.359 --> 2652.24
awakening now

2656.8 --> 2660.2000000000003
like an awokening

2662.56 --> 2666.96
which in my opinion is like

2664.72 --> 2668.64
the most evil thing

2666.96 --> 2670.8
imaginable really

2668.64 --> 2674.72
it's just that you can't really even

2670.8 --> 2677.28
realize it how freaking evil it is

2674.72 --> 2680.8799999999997
to try to change true awakening

2677.28 --> 2682.8
purity absolute truthful purity into

2680.88 --> 2687.44
awokening

2682.8 --> 2690.8
which is blatantly exactly the opposite

2687.44 --> 2692.96
it's like oh opening a door

2690.8 --> 2695.2000000000003
not to actually go through it but to

2692.96 --> 2697.839
realize there is an open door so you

2695.2 --> 2703.24
could literally just

2697.839 --> 2703.24
start building false doors everywhere

2705.359 --> 2709.2799999999997
yeah that's a very good comparison

2707.76 --> 2714.0400000000004
actually

2709.28 --> 2714.0400000000004
woke is deeper sleep yeah awokening

2736.319 --> 2740.48
you're pushing symbiosis between machine

2738.8 --> 2743.2000000000003
and human yeah of course they are but

2740.48 --> 2746.72
that was even in the matrix one already

2743.2 --> 2749.1189999999997
where it's already happened

2746.72 --> 2752.16
but yeah there's one problem though it

2749.119 --> 2756.4
can't work

2752.16 --> 2757.5989999999997
yeah it can't work it can't work

2756.4 --> 2760.96
you can't

2757.599 --> 2764.4
integrate biology

2760.96 --> 2767.839
with machinery like that

2764.4 --> 2770.7200000000003
the only way it can work

2767.839 --> 2773.119
is through the borg system

2770.72 --> 2774.72
yeah that's something that people don't

2773.119 --> 2777.359
even realize

2774.72 --> 2780.16
that they thought about the borg what

2777.359 --> 2783.92
that actually is when they put that in

2780.16 --> 2784.8799999999997
there in the series star trek

2783.92 --> 2786.96
yeah

2784.88 --> 2791.92
you can't

2786.96 --> 2796.64
just integrate biology with electronics

2791.92 --> 2798.48
because the body rejects it it rejects

2796.64 --> 2803.5989999999997
it you can't

2798.48 --> 2806.96
have a lasting interface it rejects it

2803.599 --> 2808.56
yeah the design it rejects it so what do

2806.96 --> 2810.56
you have to do

2808.56 --> 2811.7599999999998
modify it

2810.56 --> 2815.44
modify

2811.76 --> 2816.96
the rejection system so you don't reject

2815.44 --> 2819.52
it anymore and guess what's going to

2816.96 --> 2822.16
happen oh you're not human anymore when

2819.52 --> 2824.48
you do that you're not even normal

2822.16 --> 2828.319
biology when you do that

2824.48 --> 2831.119
you have deranged disintegrated the

2828.319 --> 2834.64
original design when you do that

2831.119 --> 2837.2000000000003
and yeah you might be able to assimilate

2834.64 --> 2839.52
devices and be doing something with it

2837.2 --> 2843.7599999999998
but you're going to be turning into a

2839.52 --> 2846.559
bubbling disintegrating festering mess

2843.76 --> 2850.48
absolutely inevitably and it'll shorten

2846.559 --> 2850.48
lifespan dramatically

2855.28 --> 2859.48
dude get the [ __ ] out of here

2868.88 --> 2873.839
yeah

2870.16 --> 2873.839
the borg it's funny isn't it

2874.48 --> 2878.8
right

2876.72 --> 2880.64
yeah the work is just a

2878.8 --> 2883.599
invention

2880.64 --> 2888.4
based on science fiction thinking

2883.599 --> 2890.0
and transhumanism like hey what about

2888.4 --> 2892.64
like living and

2890.0 --> 2893.839
have robotic half living what would that

2892.64 --> 2894.7999999999997
be like

2893.839 --> 2897.04
well

2894.8 --> 2898.96
but you would start rejecting

2897.04 --> 2901.119
the electronic parts so i have to change

2898.96 --> 2903.599
the body in order to stop rejecting it

2901.119 --> 2905.92
and blah blah blah blah nano bots and

2903.599 --> 2905.92
blue

2907.2 --> 2914.5589999999997
right the biology is more like a corpse

2912.079 --> 2916.7200000000003
it's more like a darth vader setup

2914.559 --> 2919.2000000000003
because the biology always becomes

2916.72 --> 2921.5989999999997
secondary

2919.2 --> 2922.96
it becomes secondary to all the

2921.599 --> 2924.079
electronics

2922.96 --> 2926.8
because

2924.079 --> 2930.0
you don't have to tame electronics to

2926.8 --> 2931.52
adapt to biology

2930.0 --> 2934.4
you have to

2931.52 --> 2936.4
adapt the biology to be able to

2934.4 --> 2938.64
assimilate the electronics and that

2936.4 --> 2940.48
means changing it that means disrupting

2938.64 --> 2942.8799999999997
it that means basically

2940.48 --> 2945.2
taking away its natural ability to

2942.88 --> 2946.96
become self-reliant

2945.2 --> 2948.3999999999996
which is what that is

2946.96 --> 2951.4
to reject

2948.4 --> 2951.4
non-genetic

2951.44 --> 2956.92
based things of its own genes right

2957.2 --> 2961.839
so eventually the biology always kind of

2959.92 --> 2963.76
becomes

2961.839 --> 2967.72
a side note

2963.76 --> 2967.7200000000003
to that form of assimilation

2970.64 --> 2975.1189999999997
it's already 2022 there what

2976.64 --> 2978.96
really

2981.92 --> 2985.44
in australia

2983.599 --> 2987.52
okay

2985.44 --> 2990.0
well happy new year to you professor

2987.52 --> 2990.0
filwell

2994.8 --> 3000.7200000000003
i certainly hope i get the year i hope

2997.359 --> 3000.72
for myself too yeah

3003.52 --> 3006.319
that would be great

3009.52 --> 3013.839
yeah and yeah hope you have a good year

3011.76 --> 3013.8390000000004
too

3033.119 --> 3036.119
right

3044.8 --> 3047.119
right

3047.52 --> 3052.88
so yeah to kind of round out my point

3050.559 --> 3055.76
about the borg thing

3052.88 --> 3058.319
the problem is with the idea of borg and

3055.76 --> 3059.8390000000004
the idea of transhumanism to become like

3058.319 --> 3062.96
cyborgs

3059.839 --> 3065.119
it can't really work

3062.96 --> 3069.04
because in its development it will

3065.119 --> 3070.1600000000003
effectively simply turn to

3069.04 --> 3072.5589999999997
humans

3070.16 --> 3075.359
basically sacrificing themselves to

3072.559 --> 3077.6800000000003
become an electronic avatar

3075.359 --> 3079.68
because the more you

3077.68 --> 3081.9199999999996
modify

3079.68 --> 3084.0789999999997
your genetic makeup and all that to be

3081.92 --> 3085.119
able to

3084.079 --> 3087.599
yeah

3085.119 --> 3091.04
endure

3087.599 --> 3091.04
grafted electronics

3092.16 --> 3097.44
the more away from the original design

3094.64 --> 3100.64
of your blueprint you'll go

3097.44 --> 3102.0
and the more you will be incapable of

3100.64 --> 3105.04
peak

3102.0 --> 3107.28
focus consciousness

3105.04 --> 3110.96
because peak focus consciousness

3107.28 --> 3111.8390000000004
requires you to be whole and unified you

3110.96 --> 3112.88
see

3111.839 --> 3114.64
because otherwise you're going to be

3112.88 --> 3116.079
sick and then like me

3114.64 --> 3119.5989999999997
not because there's any genetic

3116.079 --> 3121.04
modification i hope at least

3119.599 --> 3121.76
and i feel

3121.04 --> 3123.68
like

3121.76 --> 3126.6400000000003
my body has to scramble yeah it

3123.68 --> 3128.0789999999997
distracts you can't you can't then be

3126.64 --> 3130.16
the peak

3128.079 --> 3132.8
the peak form of yourself

3130.16 --> 3135.7599999999998
so effectively if you

3132.8 --> 3138.7200000000003
want to assimilate

3135.76 --> 3141.0400000000004
into some semi semi-computer system

3138.72 --> 3143.7599999999998
whatever

3141.04 --> 3146.8
you're literally going to sacrifice your

3143.76 --> 3149.0400000000004
consciousness ability which is really

3146.8 --> 3149.04
you

3151.28 --> 3157.119
in order to adapt you will literally

3153.2 --> 3159.4399999999996
sacrifice your being

3157.119 --> 3164.599
right you might not be aware of it

3159.44 --> 3164.599
when you engage but that is what happens

3166.319 --> 3170.0
so does it really is it really a big

3168.319 --> 3174.079
difference to say like well i'm going to

3170.0 --> 3176.0
sacrifice for the gods or blah blah

3174.079 --> 3179.119
i'm going to sacrifice myself for the

3176.0 --> 3180.64
gods for so that the group

3179.119 --> 3183.52
like ancient times

3180.64 --> 3184.64
or just like the imagination you're

3183.52 --> 3186.8
gonna

3184.64 --> 3190.319
integrate into some computer and become

3186.8 --> 3192.1600000000003
some super special boy electronics guy

3190.319 --> 3194.72
and then basically

3192.16 --> 3197.359
yeah creating

3194.72 --> 3199.68
biological mishaps with yourself over

3197.359 --> 3200.96
time deranging

3199.68 --> 3204.16
your being

3200.96 --> 3205.52
and then losing it no longer being that

3204.16 --> 3208.7999999999997
peak

3205.52 --> 3211.04
focused conscious person that you used

3208.8 --> 3213.04
to be

3211.04 --> 3216.359
what's the difference i don't see much

3213.04 --> 3216.359
of a difference

3226.72 --> 3229.72
right

3247.359 --> 3250.359
so

3256.96 --> 3262.0
yeah

3258.4 --> 3266.0
yeah as for vitamin d keflar

3262.0 --> 3266.0
vitamin d is pretty easy to get though

3267.68 --> 3271.5589999999997
at least it is now

3278.16 --> 3281.839
digital mudflat

3282.96 --> 3285.839
that's hilarious

3291.119 --> 3296.48
can you then build digital bricks out of

3294.24 --> 3299.9599999999996
it for the rebuilding of society of

3296.48 --> 3299.96
digital society

3308.24 --> 3312.5589999999997
are we gonna have like digital buildings

3311.04 --> 3316.16
that are like

3312.559 --> 3316.1600000000003
basements that are halfway

3316.64 --> 3321.0
in the electronic world too

3340.319 --> 3345.119
wipeout well yeah well dude they could

3343.2 --> 3346.48
wipe it all out they could just click

3345.119 --> 3348.96
and it's gone

3346.48 --> 3352.72
like all the data's all erased yeah they

3348.96 --> 3353.68
can't do that they can do that right now

3352.72 --> 3356.48
yeah

3353.68 --> 3356.48
but then what

3357.04 --> 3362.68
they're dependent on all of it just like

3359.44 --> 3362.68
we are

3372.48 --> 3379.76
and they know the [ __ ] that

3375.76 --> 3382.0
they've contracted themselves into right

3379.76 --> 3384.1600000000003
the controllers

3382.0 --> 3387.599
the owners they know what they've

3384.16 --> 3387.5989999999997
contracted themselves into

3387.92 --> 3391.28
and if they

3389.28 --> 3393.76
take away

3391.28 --> 3395.599
all the information all our ways of

3393.76 --> 3397.44
learning then we

3395.599 --> 3399.2000000000003
the humans

3397.44 --> 3401.76
will kill them

3399.2 --> 3405.52
eventually right because what happens

3401.76 --> 3406.559
when you can no longer distract somebody

3405.52 --> 3409.68
yeah

3406.559 --> 3409.6800000000003
they get to the point

3411.68 --> 3416.8799999999997
right and we've been like that for a

3414.079 --> 3418.559
while now like humanity at this point is

3416.88 --> 3419.52
basically ready

3418.559 --> 3421.6800000000003
to

3419.52 --> 3424.319
to finish it all off

3421.68 --> 3427.7599999999998
the for the big slaughter

3424.319 --> 3429.7599999999998
like a big big slaughter with a lot of

3427.76 --> 3432.0
dead people worldwide

3429.76 --> 3433.6800000000003
we're all ready for that pretty much

3432.0 --> 3436.24
it's just that

3433.68 --> 3438.5589999999997
there's so much around we're just too

3436.24 --> 3441.1189999999997
distracted to even get to that and then

3438.559 --> 3443.52
we forget it exists

3441.119 --> 3446.1600000000003
temporarily as long as it keeps going

3443.52 --> 3449.359
yeah that's the situation right now they

3446.16 --> 3449.359
turn this thing off

3449.44 --> 3455.04
