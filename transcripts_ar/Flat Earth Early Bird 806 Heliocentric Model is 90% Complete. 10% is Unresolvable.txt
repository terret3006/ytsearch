6.16 --> 36.5
[Music]

151.44 --> 154.56
oh

151.84 --> 154.56
sheesh

155.68 --> 164.16
yeah i was muted

159.68 --> 168.16
well i hope you got a good look at least

164.16 --> 171.04
to summarize it uh it's not as sunny but

168.16 --> 172.879
thanks to the snow still kind of bright

171.04 --> 174.79999999999998
because there is clouds and there is

172.879 --> 177.67999999999998
wind and the wind is very cold

174.8 --> 177.68
so there you go

181.12 --> 188.159
thank you for reminding me brendam

184.319 --> 198.39999999999998
and here we go again morning it's sunday

188.159 --> 200.79999999999998
the 14th of february 2021

198.4 --> 203.68
well does that mean that i my entire

200.8 --> 206.87900000000002
intro wasn't mute

203.68 --> 206.87900000000002
i just realized that

207.03 --> 210.11
[Applause]

210.72 --> 216.319
it's because just computer reasons i had

214.239 --> 218.0
my computer on

216.319 --> 220.72
pretty much all night i forgot to turn

218.0 --> 225.36
it off at some point

220.72 --> 228.879
and i always put my microphone on mute

225.36 --> 232.31900000000002
after i don't do any more shows

228.879 --> 234.239
and yeah so it was still on mute when in

232.319 --> 236.319
contrast to when you actually turned

234.239 --> 239.76
when i turned my computer on it always

236.319 --> 239.76
started it's not on mute so

243.439 --> 248.879
yes all muted oh goody oh well

250.48 --> 255.84
it can't always be perfect

260.959 --> 269.84000000000003
right so yeah yesterday was pretty

264.08 --> 269.84
interesting day

269.919 --> 274.08
yeah the player of the early bird was

272.32 --> 279.04
good

274.08 --> 282.24
and today again i'm titling it

279.04 --> 285.04
concerning mercury because

282.24 --> 285.04
like yeah

288.4 --> 292.63899999999995
it's i'm still thinking back about my

290.479 --> 294.639
appearance on mr sensible and just what

292.639 --> 298.08
their responses were and the lack of

294.639 --> 301.12
responses you know with the way that i

298.08 --> 302.88
compose myself in the face of that

301.12 --> 306.08
situation

302.88 --> 308.15999999999997
and like right after and even yesterday

306.08 --> 311.19899999999996
it was still like ah

308.16 --> 313.36
just the nuisance of it right

311.199 --> 315.28000000000003
that draws my attention away from what

313.36 --> 317.52000000000004
was actually happening and the more i

315.28 --> 318.0
think about it the more i realized that

317.52 --> 320.96
this

318.0 --> 320.96
mercury thing

321.68 --> 329.6
it's like this burning iron

326.32 --> 330.8
that's just it in the way of the ballers

329.6 --> 334.40000000000003
because it is

330.8 --> 334.88
one of their planets you know which is

334.4 --> 338.23999999999995
like

334.88 --> 341.68
the primary it's the foundation

338.24 --> 344.40000000000003
of the system like that's the foundation

341.68 --> 344.8
of their imagining of most of the cgi

344.4 --> 348.15999999999997
that

344.8 --> 350.8
goes down right the heliocentric model

348.16 --> 354.639
the solar system

350.8 --> 357.84000000000003
and it's just a glaring

354.639 --> 362.96000000000004
gap in the system

357.84 --> 366.479
it can't work they can't get it to work

362.96 --> 369.52
and right there right in the middle

366.479 --> 372.4
of the core of it all

369.52 --> 374.0
the gravity won't work they can't get it

372.4 --> 378.08
to work

374.0 --> 378.08
it's like an unfinished machine

378.72 --> 383.199
and just in that mercury position where

381.52 --> 385.28
everything else is supposedly all

383.199 --> 386.72
modeled the mercury is just not it's

385.28 --> 389.19899999999996
just a circle

386.72 --> 390.16
don't think about it because they can't

389.199 --> 395.12
get it to work

390.16 --> 398.72
how amazing is that

395.12 --> 402.08
so mercury just mercury

398.72 --> 403.91900000000004
the planet mercury is a heavy weight

402.08 --> 405.44
a heavy burden on their shoulders

403.919 --> 409.68
because they can't fix

405.44 --> 411.199
it like they really can't fix it this is

409.68 --> 413.68
even

411.199 --> 416.479
you can't even suspense of disbelief fix

413.68 --> 420.88
it at this point

416.479 --> 422.96
well they probably could eventually but

420.88 --> 425.759
like in contrast to for example

422.96 --> 428.0
terrestrial refraction

425.759 --> 429.12
mercury works just fine yeah yeah yeah i

428.0 --> 433.039
know sure

429.12 --> 435.52
sure it does indeed function sure

433.039 --> 437.039
right except you can't calculate the

435.52 --> 440.96
gravity for it

437.039 --> 443.36
yeah there is no math

440.96 --> 446.08
for it right all you got is basically

443.36 --> 449.44
the angular path and consistency the

446.08 --> 451.75899999999996
pattern it follows across the sky

449.44 --> 452.479
and yeah the gravity calculations won't

451.759 --> 456.40000000000003
work

452.479 --> 458.639
now you can see oh look because

456.4 --> 460.63899999999995
yeah the newtonian gravity can't really

458.639 --> 463.039
be made to work in that

460.639 --> 464.639
so we're just going to apply einsteinian

463.039 --> 467.759
gravity to it

464.639 --> 469.599
well that literally means

467.759 --> 470.8
you don't do anything with it because

469.599 --> 474.0
einstein gravity

470.8 --> 475.44
doesn't actually do anything it can't

474.0 --> 478.879
calculate

475.44 --> 482.0
solar system gravity setups

478.879 --> 484.24
it cannot do that you know why because

482.0 --> 486.639
it can't calculate for more by

484.24 --> 489.199
than one body of attraction per

486.639 --> 491.879
definition

489.199 --> 494.879
yeah so that means there is no

491.879 --> 494.879
calculation

495.039 --> 499.68
with any form of gravity concerning the

497.759 --> 502.72
path of mercury within the

499.68 --> 506.16
presupposed solar system what

502.72 --> 509.28000000000003
what yeah yeah you didn't know that

506.16 --> 510.8
nobody told you right because it's a

509.28 --> 513.1999999999999
glaring gap

510.8 --> 514.88
in the heliocentric model it's like 10

513.2 --> 518.479
percent

514.88 --> 522.479
of its entirety is just missing

518.479 --> 522.479
there's nothing that you can do about it

524.32 --> 528.399
how do you solve something with

526.399 --> 531.12
relativity

528.399 --> 532.56
that doesn't solve anything it's just an

531.12 --> 536.32
excuse you make

532.56 --> 538.2399999999999
to explain why it doesn't work the way

536.32 --> 540.399
it's supposed to work it's an

538.24 --> 542.0
explanation it's not a calculation it

540.399 --> 545.04
cannot be calculated

542.0 --> 548.16
you can't emulate

545.04 --> 551.519
the solar system with mercury in it

548.16 --> 554.56
with some kind of gravity-based system

551.519 --> 557.76
you can't do it you can't emulate

554.56 --> 560.8
it in a singular

557.76 --> 563.279
form in a singular calculation

560.8 --> 565.04
that includes mercury no no you can do

563.279 --> 568.32
it with all except mercury

565.04 --> 571.68
you have to take that out and then just

568.32 --> 575.0400000000001
basically draw it in there as a side

571.68 --> 579.519
prop yeah because you can't

575.04 --> 582.3199999999999
put it in there as a whole

579.519 --> 583.68
oh deny gravity oh look i'll share your

582.32 --> 586.6400000000001
pain indifference

583.68 --> 586.64
share your pain

587.6 --> 591.2
yes celebrate it celebrate your downfall

590.8 --> 594.64
that

591.2 --> 599.44
glaring 10 gap

594.64 --> 599.4399999999999
within your solar system yeah

599.92 --> 604.079
you're not even listening are you deny

602.399 --> 607.04
gravity no you're the one

604.079 --> 608.7199999999999
actually denying gravity i'm

607.04 --> 611.1999999999999
presupposing gravity

608.72 --> 612.9590000000001
and within the presupposition i'm

611.2 --> 616.1600000000001
informing you

612.959 --> 620.0
that your heliocentric model

616.16 --> 622.079
has a 10 gap within its entirety

620.0 --> 624.32
it's just something's missing you can't

622.079 --> 628.079
get it to fit

624.32 --> 630.72
from within the idea of gravity

628.079 --> 633.279
yeah i'm giving you everything

630.72 --> 635.279
everything i'm giving you gravity i'm

633.279 --> 636.88
giving you newtonian gravity even though

635.279 --> 640.16
it never claimed the hypothesis

636.88 --> 643.68
i'm all giving you that in this instance

640.16 --> 646.8
and sharing with you informing you

643.68 --> 648.16
ten percent gap within the entire

646.8 --> 650.4799999999999
heliocentric model

648.16 --> 651.36
our solar system the things that we can

650.48 --> 654.72
actually see

651.36 --> 656.5600000000001
pretty close by or apparently close by

654.72 --> 658.8000000000001
using telescopes and all that and

656.56 --> 662.3199999999999
presuppose they're balls right

658.8 --> 664.88
well ten percent of it yeah

662.32 --> 666.0790000000001
nine planets but and which includes

664.88 --> 669.2
earth supposed to be

666.079 --> 670.0
and the sun right not calculating what

669.2 --> 673.44
is it anymore

670.0 --> 674.56
uh pluto whatever you know that's why

673.44 --> 677.2790000000001
i'm saying 10

674.56 --> 678.64
it's basically just it's just a planet

677.279 --> 681.279
it's just one of those

678.64 --> 681.68
wondering stars that's all right you

681.279 --> 684.16
can't

681.68 --> 686.3199999999999
you can't calculate you want a citation

684.16 --> 689.6
i'm the citation

686.32 --> 693.12
i just pointed it out to you that this

689.6 --> 696.48
is true i don't have to cite anyone i

693.12 --> 699.2
flat earthers and theorists

696.48 --> 700.8000000000001
like myself cosmogonical theorists we

699.2 --> 704.6400000000001
don't have to

700.8 --> 707.92
wait for some heliocentric

704.64 --> 709.8
sophistry bullshitter or

707.92 --> 711.279
physicist perhaps that likes

709.8 --> 714.7199999999999
heliocentrism

711.279 --> 716.88
to make some kind of remark in order to

714.72 --> 717.76
figure something out to make a statement

716.88 --> 720.639
now i can just

717.76 --> 720.959
look at the material hear certain things

720.639 --> 724.16
be

720.959 --> 727.3599999999999
said hear

724.16 --> 731.4399999999999
no counters and then realize

727.36 --> 734.32
like wait it's thanks to rumpus really

731.44 --> 737.839
rumpus shared this information with me

734.32 --> 738.48
like it or reminded me i guess because i

737.839 --> 740.399
think

738.48 --> 743.44
i remember vaguely that i heard it

740.399 --> 745.36
before like 20 years ago

743.44 --> 747.7600000000001
and i never got anywhere with it but it

745.36 --> 748.16
like gave me a real moment of rush to

747.76 --> 751.6
like

748.16 --> 752.8
whoa if mercury can't be made to fit

751.6 --> 756.48
there's like something

752.8 --> 759.4799999999999
really black hole warping

756.48 --> 761.04
going on that's what i thought as a

759.48 --> 763.76
heliocentrist myself

761.04 --> 764.7199999999999
20 years ago but then nobody gave me

763.76 --> 767.12
anything

764.72 --> 768.399
they were all just like oh no just step

767.12 --> 771.2
we don't

768.399 --> 773.12
don't go there don't go to mercury it's

771.2 --> 779.36
a dangerous place

773.12 --> 779.36
like that and now i understand why

780.16 --> 786.959
because it's a giant 10 percent gap

783.92 --> 789.279
within the very solar system that is the

786.959 --> 792.2399999999999
foundation of the heliocentric model

789.279 --> 794.079
it's everything that is the closest by

792.24 --> 795.44
to which there should be the least

794.079 --> 797.76
speculation of

795.44 --> 797.7600000000001
it all

799.36 --> 803.6800000000001
within the heliocentric belief it's the

801.2 --> 807.0400000000001
foundation it's where it all rests on

803.68 --> 807.76
and 10 one of these wandering stars the

807.04 --> 813.279
mercury

807.76 --> 813.279
it can't be made to fit in calculations

813.519 --> 820.399
right you can emulate

817.04 --> 824.079
that spinny thing and then have

820.399 --> 824.959
mercury in it as a whole as a balancing

824.079 --> 827.519
out of all the

824.959 --> 828.399
newtonian gravity things it can be made

827.519 --> 831.199
to fit

828.399 --> 832.72
if you put it in there it collapses

831.199 --> 835.92
doesn't stay stable

832.72 --> 839.1990000000001
right that that's what that's what

835.92 --> 839.5999999999999
that is the gravity so you put it in

839.199 --> 842.4799999999999
there

839.6 --> 843.44
presuppose certain weights tested out it

842.48 --> 846.8000000000001
all collapses

843.44 --> 851.6800000000001
every time you can't get

846.8 --> 855.519
mercury in the heliocentric model

851.68 --> 855.519
with gravity it can't work

855.76 --> 863.76
that's just a fact i don't need to cite

859.6 --> 866.9590000000001
cite anyone for this it's a fact

863.76 --> 869.36
i know it i know it is and if

866.959 --> 870.16
some supposed specialist would like to

869.36 --> 873.76
say no no no

870.16 --> 874.8
it it has been done here let me show you

873.76 --> 878.3199999999999
exactly

874.8 --> 880.56
how that model works and they can show

878.32 --> 882.8000000000001
that the heliocentric in its entirety

880.56 --> 886.6389999999999
can be calculated with gravity

882.8 --> 889.76
in a single formula i would be very

886.639 --> 893.04
fascinated to study that

889.76 --> 893.6
but as far as i've gathered yeah mercury

893.04 --> 896.639
can

893.6 --> 900.48
it always has to be separate it's like a

896.639 --> 901.279
an add-on because it it is visible after

900.48 --> 904.24
all

901.279 --> 905.92
there's sort of an idea of its pathway

904.24 --> 909.279
in the heliocentric model

905.92 --> 911.92
you just can't work out the gravity

909.279 --> 913.92
you know maybe at some point they're

911.92 --> 916.639
going to decide that

913.92 --> 917.92
that it might not actually be a planet

916.639 --> 921.36
just a weird

917.92 --> 924.399
visual apparition or something

921.36 --> 926.32
right or maybe it turns out to be

924.399 --> 928.24
like a miniature gas plant but that

926.32 --> 930.32
would make yeah

928.24 --> 932.16
i think they probably already speculated

930.32 --> 935.6800000000001
about how to solve this and they just

932.16 --> 936.959
couldn't work it out no matter what

935.68 --> 939.4399999999999
and that's why they don't address it

936.959 --> 940.4799999999999
anymore because look i'm not the first

939.44 --> 943.519
person here

940.48 --> 945.6
of course to think about hey

943.519 --> 946.639
how to put these things together how to

945.6 --> 949.6
put the game

946.639 --> 951.04
together in order to make it believable

949.6 --> 952.72
right that's what they did that's how

951.04 --> 954.639
they all built it up i'm doing that

952.72 --> 956.72
right now after the fact

954.639 --> 957.6800000000001
after the fact because i'm a late

956.72 --> 960.639
awakener and

957.68 --> 962.16
people been working on this perhaps for

960.639 --> 964.0
centuries maybe

962.16 --> 965.279
all of this has been built centuries ago

964.0 --> 967.68
but they they

965.279 --> 969.12
must have come across this stumbling

967.68 --> 971.5999999999999
block

969.12 --> 973.36
because it's just not properly addressed

971.6 --> 975.759
only trenchers make up

973.36 --> 977.6800000000001
excuses for it that make no sense

975.759 --> 980.9590000000001
because everything is okay for them

977.68 --> 984.6389999999999
doesn't have to make sense for them

980.959 --> 984.6389999999999
in order for it to be acceptable

985.839 --> 989.759
just say a couple of words that don't

988.56 --> 991.5999999999999
resolve the issue

989.759 --> 994.0
and then it's all right because you can

991.6 --> 997.839
think about that it's all right

994.0 --> 997.839
that's allowed

1007.44 --> 1014.1600000000001
see let's just continuous it's just

1011.04 --> 1015.759
yeah no it is it is complete it is no

1014.16 --> 1019.12
it's not complete

1015.759 --> 1021.44
it's not you don't even know your own

1019.12 --> 1023.199
model you don't even know the history of

1021.44 --> 1025.6000000000001
your own model you don't even know how

1023.199 --> 1027.6
it works you can't emulate it

1025.6 --> 1029.52
you can't even get all the factors right

1027.6 --> 1031.76
in your head in order to emulate it

1029.52 --> 1033.439
because if you could you wouldn't do

1031.76 --> 1036.48
this thing

1033.439 --> 1038.24
because you know then

1036.48 --> 1040.799
if you know how to work that then you

1038.24 --> 1041.36
probably learn about other people trying

1040.799 --> 1043.76
that

1041.36 --> 1045.039
and you will have learned about that you

1043.76 --> 1048.48
can't

1045.039 --> 1050.96
get mercury to work

1048.48 --> 1053.6
with gravity within the heliocentric

1050.96 --> 1056.16
model

1053.6 --> 1060.08
what's missing what what's missing is

1056.16 --> 1063.919
mercury as a gravity body

1060.08 --> 1063.9189999999999
in the heliocentric model that's what's

1064.84 --> 1070.32
missing

1066.799 --> 1072.08
at this point they are kind of like

1070.32 --> 1074.72
keeping it a secret that they're

1072.08 --> 1078.32
counting it as nothing but just a light

1074.72 --> 1081.039
it's nothing it has no mass can't have

1078.32 --> 1082.72
any mass because then the gravity

1081.039 --> 1084.72
balance couldn't work out

1082.72 --> 1086.4
so they're basically just accepting it

1084.72 --> 1089.3600000000001
as a light that also

1086.4 --> 1091.3600000000001
is not transparent and could potentially

1089.36 --> 1094.32
block the sun or whatever

1091.36 --> 1096.08
but they're not calculating any mass

1094.32 --> 1098.48
because they can't

1096.08 --> 1100.72
can't have any gravity because then the

1098.48 --> 1108.64
heliocentric model collapses it doesn't

1100.72 --> 1110.799
work anymore it doesn't stay stable

1108.64 --> 1111.8400000000001
how is mercury explained on the fe model

1110.799 --> 1114.24
oh it's very simple

1111.84 --> 1116.6399999999999
it's a wandering star it's a light

1114.24 --> 1120.799
apparition

1116.64 --> 1124.24
that follows very persistent circular

1120.799 --> 1127.44
oscillating patterns across

1124.24 --> 1128.96
the globe of the heavens the luminaries

1127.44 --> 1137.45
as they appear

1128.96 --> 1141.309
to those that can observe

1137.45 --> 1141.309
[Music]

1145.679 --> 1155.039
this is

1151.12 --> 1156.1599999999999
oh wizard king are you paying any

1155.039 --> 1159.36
attention

1156.16 --> 1163.28
or or did you just go in the chat to uh

1159.36 --> 1166.24
bother people in my chat and did you

1163.28 --> 1168.24
put it on mute so you can't hear me give

1166.24 --> 1171.44
me a sign that you're listening

1168.24 --> 1171.44
the wizard king

1173.76 --> 1178.08
address me you got 30 seconds to in some

1177.679 --> 1180.799
way

1178.08 --> 1182.32
address me the wizard king and the

1180.799 --> 1185.679
others don't

1182.32 --> 1188.559
don't talk to him don't tell him just

1185.679 --> 1189.44
let's just see if he's listening because

1188.559 --> 1192.3999999999999
he's not

1189.44 --> 1194.96
i'm gonna ban him because then he is a

1192.4 --> 1194.96
chat troll

1195.84 --> 1200.32
then he's here just to bother other

1197.44 --> 1204.72
people ah

1200.32 --> 1204.72
it seems like we got one

1204.799 --> 1209.52
we got one ten seconds

1210.799 --> 1214.08
ten seconds still banning the wizard

1212.72 --> 1221.84
king address me

1214.08 --> 1221.84
address me got five seconds

1222.32 --> 1225.52
there right

1229.76 --> 1236.59
boom right

1234.24 --> 1239.65
yeah i don't accept that

1236.59 --> 1239.6499999999999
[Music]

1240.799 --> 1246.0
if you're just in the chat just enact

1243.679 --> 1246.799
people in my chat and you don't actually

1246.0 --> 1250.64
listen

1246.799 --> 1252.72
to the show i banned you

1250.64 --> 1254.64
you understand because i interact with

1252.72 --> 1254.96
my chat and if you don't address me if

1254.64 --> 1258.48
you

1254.96 --> 1262.96
ignore me right the show host

1258.48 --> 1265.3600000000001
on my own show then i ban you

1262.96 --> 1266.96
because it's extremely rude and

1265.36 --> 1272.24
disruptive you're being

1266.96 --> 1272.24
a heckler if you do that

1273.84 --> 1282.1589999999999
right indy thonson can you hear me

1277.679 --> 1285.3600000000001
address me say my name in chat

1282.159 --> 1285.3600000000001
can you hear me indifference

1289.12 --> 1308.08
you got 30 seconds

1304.48 --> 1309.3600000000001
good right see and that's why you can

1308.08 --> 1312.559
stay

1309.36 --> 1314.6
you're just a baller that's okay

1312.559 --> 1316.0
you have your opinions you have your

1314.6 --> 1319.039
misunderstandings

1316.0 --> 1320.88
but you're at least respecting the show

1319.039 --> 1322.8799999999999
house by actually listening

1320.88 --> 1326.5590000000002
right and that's why you don't get

1322.88 --> 1330.0
banned see that's the difference

1326.559 --> 1330.6399999999999
that's how it works i should probably

1330.0 --> 1333.039
put

1330.64 --> 1334.0
another extra rule in the description

1333.039 --> 1336.48
box

1334.0 --> 1336.48
for that

1344.0 --> 1361.84
yeah in the i know andy

1372.88 --> 1377.0390000000002
freedom of speech should not be no it is

1375.12 --> 1379.36
freedom of speech

1377.039 --> 1382.559
but yeah freedom of speech doesn't come

1379.36 --> 1382.559
without consequences

1386.0 --> 1390.559
right there's rules i'm not preventing

1389.44 --> 1394.0
uh

1390.559 --> 1397.76
this the wizard king chat troll

1394.0 --> 1400.88
to nag other people in other places

1397.76 --> 1402.559
but i have to freedom to keep him out

1400.88 --> 1405.8400000000001
because he doesn't respect me and he's

1402.559 --> 1405.84
disruptive right

1408.96 --> 1412.96
it's not because of his opinions and i'm

1410.72 --> 1416.4
not preventing him

1412.96 --> 1417.919
from sharing his opinions elsewhere

1416.4 --> 1421.1200000000001
because that would be more in the

1417.919 --> 1424.96
direction of censorship is basically

1421.12 --> 1427.12
preventing some people

1424.96 --> 1428.8400000000001
some group or an individual from

1427.12 --> 1431.84
speaking out

1428.84 --> 1431.84
everywhere

1434.159 --> 1441.0390000000002
especially if it just is because of one

1437.2 --> 1445.8400000000001
particular item

1441.039 --> 1445.84
and it becomes censorship

1448.799 --> 1452.48
all right yes seeking star wars hello

1451.36 --> 1459.84
yeah i've seen it

1452.48 --> 1459.84
it's pretty cool

1463.52 --> 1470.96
cite the formula for buoyancy

1466.96 --> 1474.799
now the formula for buoyancy oh buoyancy

1470.96 --> 1476.4
basically presupposes gravity

1474.799 --> 1479.76
that's what it does but it is

1476.4 --> 1482.799
technically relative density it's just

1479.76 --> 1484.72
yeah that it's in

1482.799 --> 1486.1589999999999
it's the other side it's what happens

1484.72 --> 1488.64
when the medium

1486.159 --> 1489.919
is denser than the object then buoyancy

1488.64 --> 1493.76
happens

1489.919 --> 1495.44
right but it presupposes gravity and you

1493.76 --> 1498.0
don't need to do that

1495.44 --> 1498.72
it's very simple to just use relative

1498.0 --> 1502.08
density

1498.72 --> 1504.0
which you can prove scientifically using

1502.08 --> 1506.0
the scientific method

1504.0 --> 1507.76
and then explain it like that because

1506.0 --> 1509.679
then you have an actual scientific

1507.76 --> 1512.84
foundation

1509.679 --> 1514.0
instead of just relying on that

1512.84 --> 1516.9599999999998
presuppositional

1514.0 --> 1519.36
system that utilizes gravity

1516.96 --> 1522.559
presupposition

1519.36 --> 1525.6
to explain it because there is no

1522.559 --> 1528.8799999999999
scientific evidence for gravity

1525.6 --> 1531.279
so why use that instead use something

1528.88 --> 1534.48
that you can scientifically prove

1531.279 --> 1534.48
it's much more efficient

1540.4 --> 1557.8400000000001
how is that condensating in new france

1564.88 --> 1571.5200000000002
does anybody in chat think that what i

1567.039 --> 1574.96
said was condescending

1571.52 --> 1576.8799999999999
i was about as mild as they could be

1574.96 --> 1579.6000000000001
there's a whole range of [ __ ] i got

1576.88 --> 1582.88
thrown at your head at that moment

1579.6 --> 1584.08
i was just informing you i was being

1582.88 --> 1588.3200000000002
extremely civil

1584.08 --> 1588.32
and you say i'm condescending it's just

1596.84 --> 1601.279
unbelievable

1598.559 --> 1601.279
hello dank

1609.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
yeah of course he is projecting

1638.84 --> 1641.84
so

1646.559 --> 1649.9189999999999
yes indeed

1653.76 --> 1660.559
yes there's just star maps and go way

1656.96 --> 1664.3990000000001
back to ancient times

1660.559 --> 1669.84
right you don't need astrophysics or

1664.399 --> 1669.84
astronomy for that

1683.279 --> 1685.6
wow

1686.559 --> 1690.24
all right anyway i was also on ball

1688.24 --> 1693.36
busters yesterday

1690.24 --> 1698.159
it was a pretty fun show anybody of you

1693.36 --> 1701.6789999999999
see that it's like a list of all the

1698.159 --> 1706.0800000000002
list of the top 50 silliest things

1701.679 --> 1711.44
said by global's silliest remarks

1706.08 --> 1714.72
that they've actually doubled down onto

1711.44 --> 1714.72
so that was fun being there

1718.88 --> 1725.8400000000001
it was a very long show by the way

1728.08 --> 1739.84
hey nathan oakley good to see you

1741.36 --> 1745.54
[Music]

1748.71 --> 1753.8400000000001
[Music]

1750.84 --> 1753.84
okay

1764.84 --> 1767.84
so

1779.2 --> 1786.64
ah hey cowapu you seen my interview with

1783.12 --> 1786.6399999999999
mr sensible what did you think

1792.84 --> 1799.279
what

1795.2 --> 1799.279
forward at nathan the emperor card

1800.48 --> 1809.84
what what do you mean

1834.84 --> 1837.84
so

1841.279 --> 1851.2
you tried watching it come on but i was

1844.64 --> 1854.0800000000002
in it

1851.2 --> 1856.48
but i guess that you would you had to

1854.08 --> 1857.4399999999998
probably stare at his face as well and i

1856.48 --> 1860.64
did look like

1857.44 --> 1863.2
even during the interview and that just

1860.64 --> 1865.519
that guy has some serious demons in him

1863.2 --> 1870.159
like

1865.519 --> 1870.159
like the the rate is just indescribable

1870.399 --> 1873.12
but i get it

1875.44 --> 1881.8400000000001
he was a bit condescending yes he was

1878.72 --> 1884.64
like it's a very snidey and hey

1881.84 --> 1885.1999999999998
i do that myself sometimes right but the

1884.64 --> 1888.88
thing is

1885.2 --> 1892.159
he was like that without

1888.88 --> 1895.519
actually having anything to show for

1892.159 --> 1898.48
as in some of the times he would just

1895.519 --> 1899.039
not respond to it just move move on

1898.48 --> 1901.2
quickly

1899.039 --> 1903.44
move on quickly right and the other

1901.2 --> 1906.0800000000002
times he would literally confess

1903.44 --> 1907.76
several times like oh i don't know about

1906.08 --> 1908.72
this oh i don't know how that works i'm

1907.76 --> 1912.72
not

1908.72 --> 1915.2
so he literally had nothing to actually

1912.72 --> 1916.96
be arrogant about it's just

1915.2 --> 1919.32
condescending

1916.96 --> 1921.039
while he obviously did not have any

1919.32 --> 1923.4399999999998
superiority

1921.039 --> 1926.32
in the fields concerning the subjects

1923.44 --> 1926.3200000000002
that were brought up

1928.159 --> 1930.48
right

1933.12 --> 1936.32
right here we go again but look when i

1935.36 --> 1938.8799999999999
am in like

1936.32 --> 1940.8799999999999
in like an angry agitated mood sir i

1938.88 --> 1943.6000000000001
have snide moods too

1940.88 --> 1945.919
but this is just like and it was

1943.6 --> 1948.32
completely unnecessary

1945.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
i wasn't being like that at all it was a

1948.32 --> 1953.12
little bit like eventually

1949.84 --> 1955.1999999999998
like i did kind of get a little snide

1953.12 --> 1957.279
myself

1955.2 --> 1960.0800000000002
but it's just because yeah and was

1957.279 --> 1963.679
constantly facing garbage

1960.08 --> 1967.12
and like

1963.679 --> 1967.76
i could have like told him every single

1967.12 --> 1969.5189999999998
time like

1967.76 --> 1971.919
no you're strumming you're scared at

1969.519 --> 1972.48
some point i'm just i just got too tired

1971.919 --> 1976.0800000000002
of it

1972.48 --> 1976.559
it's just like yeah i keep on telling

1976.08 --> 1978.0
you

1976.559 --> 1980.1589999999999
keep on telling you and you keep

1978.0 --> 1983.76
ignoring it and then he just

1980.159 --> 1987.279
ignores it and moves on and you know

1983.76 --> 1991.2
but i did the best i could i think

1987.279 --> 1993.279
i still haven't walked it back myself

1991.2 --> 1994.72
but i just remember that i was really

1993.279 --> 1997.519
focused

1994.72 --> 1997.519
for my doing

1999.039 --> 2005.76
for such for that time you know for that

2001.679 --> 2005.76
time in day it was extremely late for my

2016.84 --> 2019.84
doing

2025.12 --> 2027.4399999999998
hmm

2031.679 --> 2034.24
what uh

2034.88 --> 2047.8400000000001
my chat's getting busy

2049.28 --> 2054.96
it's a discussion going on about moving

2052.079 --> 2061.8390000000004
around the earth

2054.96 --> 2061.839
and coreos

2064.32 --> 2071.04
he is not worth my energies absolutely

2068.32 --> 2072.96
i'm not gonna look when i did there with

2071.04 --> 2076.24
mr sensible that was all very cute but

2072.96 --> 2076.2400000000002
i'm never going there again

2076.56 --> 2083.119
because yeah

2080.159 --> 2083.679
it's they're not interested they really

2083.119 --> 2085.359
aren't

2083.679 --> 2087.599
the only thing that i felt they were

2085.359 --> 2090.3199999999997
just looking for weaknesses

2087.599 --> 2093.119
that's all they were not interested in

2090.32 --> 2093.119
anything i said

2095.919 --> 2099.5989999999997
they were all just very very desperate

2098.32 --> 2101.92
to try in

2099.599 --> 2105.119
virtually in their minds to collectively

2101.92 --> 2107.839
put a dance hat on me as i declared

2105.119 --> 2108.32
that i think the celestial bodies are

2107.839 --> 2110.48
only

2108.32 --> 2112.0
lights and holographic in nature that's

2110.48 --> 2117.119
they just did not

2112.0 --> 2120.16
even want to try and understand

2117.119 --> 2124.7200000000003
none of them they didn't try

2120.16 --> 2127.92
they didn't even try and so yeah

2124.72 --> 2131.359
it's just a waste of my time they're not

2127.92 --> 2134.56
interested like mr sensible

2131.359 --> 2136.0
is not interested his chat is not

2134.56 --> 2138.88
interested

2136.0 --> 2140.64
they're only interested in just [ __ ]

2138.88 --> 2142.079
over flat earth and trying to find

2140.64 --> 2145.839
weaknesses and then just

2142.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
hammer on that for all eternity

2157.44 --> 2162.0
they're not even interested in resolving

2159.68 --> 2164.48
their own issues

2162.0 --> 2165.359
resolving their own model problems

2164.48 --> 2168.8
they're not even

2165.359 --> 2170.96
willing to build they just want to peer

2168.8 --> 2172.0
pressure everyone and everything into

2170.96 --> 2174.4
believing that it

2172.0 --> 2175.119
is a hundred percent complete and always

2174.4 --> 2177.92
works

2175.119 --> 2180.0
and stop asking questions it's like

2177.92 --> 2182.32
globe nazis

2180.0 --> 2184.32
they're not even like trenchers anymore

2182.32 --> 2184.96
it's like nazis they're just brown

2184.32 --> 2187.839
shirts

2184.96 --> 2187.839
for the globe

2189.04 --> 2192.72
they just want to peer pressure the [ __ ]

2191.52 --> 2194.72
out of everyone that

2192.72 --> 2196.24
dares to question that anything

2194.72 --> 2199.52
heliocentric is

2196.24 --> 2202.24
maybe flawed maybe like 10 percent

2199.52 --> 2204.24
broken and all that like they really

2202.24 --> 2215.4399999999996
didn't like that when i brought that up

2204.24 --> 2218.4799999999996
and kept repeating it my god

2215.44 --> 2220.64
right yeah mellow fellow

2218.48 --> 2221.68
but i think the analogy is not too far

2220.64 --> 2224.8799999999997
off now it's only

2221.68 --> 2229.2
internet activity thus far

2224.88 --> 2230.32
right but they're acting exactly like

2229.2 --> 2233.52
brown shirts like

2230.32 --> 2236.56
gather the masses more people for more

2233.52 --> 2240.88
peer pressure don't listen

2236.56 --> 2257.839
just make others do it the way you want

2240.88 --> 2257.839
i like brown shirts [ __ ]

2258.16 --> 2273.359
it's just on the internet

2271.359 --> 2274.4
the nasa thing is horseshit oh because

2273.359 --> 2277.2
it didn't say

2274.4 --> 2278.56
what you like them to say so it's only

2277.2 --> 2281.1189999999997
when nasa says

2278.56 --> 2283.2799999999997
that the earth is a globe and that

2281.119 --> 2285.2000000000003
planets is awesome and it all works

2283.28 --> 2286.6400000000003
that's when you listen to them but when

2285.2 --> 2290.48
they say something that

2286.64 --> 2299.839
just doesn't really match the rest then

2290.48 --> 2299.839
you ignore them

2301.119 --> 2307.359
wouldn't that basically show that they

2303.28 --> 2307.3590000000004
are kind of feeble as an authority

2307.599 --> 2312.48
yeah an authority by the way on which

2309.68 --> 2315.2
you rest for certain types of evidence

2312.48 --> 2318.64
like for example the earth being globe

2315.2 --> 2321.2
this is presupposed pictures in space

2318.64 --> 2321.839
right you rest on nasa for that

2321.2 --> 2324.8799999999997
authority

2321.839 --> 2327.2
very specifically so if their

2324.88 --> 2328.079
authority is actually kind of feeble

2327.2 --> 2331.7599999999998
because they do

2328.079 --> 2334.88
say things that absolutely don't match

2331.76 --> 2335.92
with your beliefs then how stable is

2334.88 --> 2338.56
that

2335.92 --> 2340.079
foundation for your very beliefs because

2338.56 --> 2344.88
you're still using them

2340.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
as a main foundation for your proofs

2344.88 --> 2355.839
right have you ever considered that

2380.839 --> 2383.839
foreign

2384.96 --> 2389.599
it's a specific case where the the

2386.8 --> 2392.48
earth's surface orientation is flat yes

2389.599 --> 2395.2000000000003
a very specific case i know

2392.48 --> 2396.32
it's just that on the globe you wouldn't

2395.2 --> 2400.24
have those

2396.32 --> 2404.319
types of specific cases now would you

2400.24 --> 2408.0789999999997
because globe is spherical and not flat

2404.319 --> 2411.839
right right so where's this specific

2408.079 --> 2411.8390000000004
case where that's apparently not so

2447.65 --> 2450.78
[Music]

2450.839 --> 2453.839
hmm

2471.44 --> 2482.7200000000003
okay omit

2480.0 --> 2484.48
right so we cite certain papers right

2482.72 --> 2487.7599999999998
and they say things

2484.48 --> 2490.16
well we're in general pretty okay when

2487.76 --> 2494.48
people have certain statements

2490.16 --> 2497.359
right even if they would be incorrect

2494.48 --> 2498.2400000000002
it would be a mistake if that were the

2497.359 --> 2502.0789999999997
case right or

2498.24 --> 2502.64
just sophistry but we like to cite

2502.079 --> 2505.119
things

2502.64 --> 2506.72
typically and the guys do at the flatter

2505.119 --> 2509.839
debate me not so much i'm

2506.72 --> 2512.8799999999997
i i'm not like that

2509.839 --> 2514.0789999999997
right although i do do some do it

2512.88 --> 2517.2000000000003
sometimes with just

2514.079 --> 2518.2400000000002
key components but they like to cite

2517.2 --> 2522.0
things because

2518.24 --> 2525.839
those things that they cite

2522.0 --> 2530.0
do actually basically point out

2525.839 --> 2534.0
facts that are widely accepted

2530.0 --> 2537.04
that contradict reality

2534.0 --> 2538.64
provably and that's why we like to cite

2537.04 --> 2542.079
them it doesn't matter that

2538.64 --> 2542.96
um beyond that citation in the paper or

2542.079 --> 2545.6800000000003
whatever

2542.96 --> 2547.04
they say certain things that you like to

2545.68 --> 2549.52
agree with

2547.04 --> 2550.079
we don't really care about that no we

2549.52 --> 2553.44
point out

2550.079 --> 2555.3590000000004
the things within it that are widely

2553.44 --> 2556.64
accepted that actually contradict

2555.359 --> 2558.319
reality probably

2556.64 --> 2561.2799999999997
that's what we like to do that's what

2558.319 --> 2564.8
flat earthers like to do

2561.28 --> 2567.92
and you as a baller as a trained baller

2564.8 --> 2570.96
like to ignore ten percent of things

2567.92 --> 2572.64
to go at the convenient ninety percent

2570.96 --> 2574.88
and then just forget about the ten

2572.64 --> 2579.839
percent that makes it completely a valid

2574.88 --> 2579.839
that's what you like to do ballers

2583.92 --> 2587.28
yeah when a flat earther faces something

2586.24 --> 2591.1189999999997
that

2587.28 --> 2596.079
absolutely disproves certain things

2591.119 --> 2596.079
then we move on and we don't cling to it

2602.48 --> 2605.68
there's no 10 percent oh like there's no

2604.72 --> 2608.9599999999996
10 percent

2605.68 --> 2612.16
like mercury's gravity pathway

2608.96 --> 2613.2
in the heliocentric solar system there's

2612.16 --> 2616.56
no 10 percent

2613.2 --> 2618.48
oh yeah full of [ __ ] oh share your pain

2616.56 --> 2621.7599999999998
with me johnny system

2618.48 --> 2624.64
because i'm pretty sure that 10

2621.76 --> 2626.2400000000002
is absolutely not accounted for and is

2624.64 --> 2627.2
being ignored because it can't be

2626.24 --> 2630.3999999999996
calculated

2627.2 --> 2635.839
using gravity within the model

2630.4 --> 2635.839
yeah they can't get it to work

2636.24 --> 2644.24
think you're just very triggered

2640.079 --> 2646.7200000000003
about that fact mathematical

2644.24 --> 2646.72
fact

2647.44 --> 2651.44
appealing to math thing that you all

2650.079 --> 2654.2400000000002
believe in so much

2651.44 --> 2655.119
you can't get it to work not that i

2654.24 --> 2656.7999999999997
would care

2655.119 --> 2658.48
because i don't believe any of that is

2656.8 --> 2663.6800000000003
real anymore

2658.48 --> 2666.56
i used to kinda way back

2663.68 --> 2667.5989999999997
you care about it i'm an idiot oh

2666.56 --> 2671.04
triggered

2667.599 --> 2675.92
you're so triggered look at you

2671.04 --> 2677.2
look at you johnny is that triggered

2675.92 --> 2679.92
yeah

2677.2 --> 2682.56
well why don't you show me a

2679.92 --> 2686.16
heliocentric model

2682.56 --> 2687.7599999999998
with newtonian mechanics working in an

2686.16 --> 2691.2799999999997
emulator

2687.76 --> 2691.76
yeah that includes mercury includes it

2691.28 --> 2694.96
all

2691.76 --> 2695.28
why'd you show me that yeah try and find

2694.96 --> 2697.04
it

2695.28 --> 2698.5600000000004
go look for it see if it's out there it

2697.04 --> 2701.68
should be out there right

2698.56 --> 2702.64
they can't just have a emulation knowing

2701.68 --> 2704.96
of how the

2702.64 --> 2705.92
heliocentric model works with gravity

2704.96 --> 2709.119
and all that

2705.92 --> 2712.56
and just leave that out right

2709.119 --> 2714.7200000000003
leave that gap that can't be real

2712.56 --> 2716.88
right right well why don't you go look

2714.72 --> 2719.2
for that complete model

2716.88 --> 2720.48
where it is a hundred percent working

2719.2 --> 2723.7599999999998
right

2720.48 --> 2726.56
with this singular gravity system

2723.76 --> 2728.7200000000003
throughout the entire solar system yeah

2726.56 --> 2732.0
why don't you go and find that

2728.72 --> 2733.9199999999996
journey system instead of just declaring

2732.0 --> 2735.599
chanting to yourself it works just fine

2733.92 --> 2739.52
it works just fine oh

2735.599 --> 2743.52
god protect me god please protect me

2739.52 --> 2745.599
you have to be real just protect me oh

2743.52 --> 2747.599
yeah why don't you go look for the

2745.599 --> 2749.52
evidence that it actually works

2747.599 --> 2752.4
instead of chanting to yourself it's all

2749.52 --> 2752.4
right it's all right

2753.28 --> 2760.3190000000004
joe is your working model you're working

2756.64 --> 2761.5989999999997
model my model is much easier like that

2760.319 --> 2763.7599999999998
because i don't have to claim any

2761.599 --> 2766.6400000000003
physicality to the heavenly lights

2763.76 --> 2767.5200000000004
so it's just a heavenly light backdrop

2766.64 --> 2771.04
pattern

2767.52 --> 2774.079
of holographic nature in some fashion

2771.04 --> 2776.8
still to be figured out

2774.079 --> 2778.88
and the rest of it is flat and there's a

2776.8 --> 2780.88
certain orientation of the landmasses

2778.88 --> 2783.599
that has to be figured out

2780.88 --> 2785.599
yeah there's a lot that has yet to be

2783.599 --> 2789.2000000000003
discovered

2785.599 --> 2792.319
right but at least i know

2789.2 --> 2796.7999999999997
what i don't know yeah that's more

2792.319 --> 2798.56
than i can say for uh you ballers

2796.8 --> 2799.8390000000004
because you don't know [ __ ] you've

2798.56 --> 2803.52
accepted so much

2799.839 --> 2807.2
taken so much for granted that you have

2803.52 --> 2807.2
absolutely no idea

2810.96 --> 2813.599
what did you do

2815.28 --> 2818.4
why did you time him out

2823.28 --> 2834.0
why did you time him out george sanford

2831.44 --> 2835.599
i do not appreciate that because now the

2834.0 --> 2837.839
text is gone

2835.599 --> 2840.48
i was in the middle of engaging him why

2837.839 --> 2845.839
did you time him out

2840.48 --> 2845.839
this is like the third time

2866.079 --> 2869.2000000000003
yeah well let him say you're stupid i'm

2868.48 --> 2871.28
literally

2869.2 --> 2872.96
holding him over the fire of course he's

2871.28 --> 2875.6800000000003
gonna say i'm stupid

2872.96 --> 2876.2400000000002
he's gonna try whatever he can to make

2875.68 --> 2878.72
the pain

2876.24 --> 2880.24
stop instead of just going away because

2878.72 --> 2882.319
i'm confronting him with something

2880.24 --> 2884.0
that's very deeply rooted

2882.319 --> 2886.16
the belief that everything is all right

2884.0 --> 2889.68
he's literally chanting to himself

2886.16 --> 2889.68
of course he's gonna add home

2891.68 --> 2896.7999999999997
i really don't appreciate that you just

2893.68 --> 2898.24
choose to time him out like that

2896.8 --> 2900.079
cause i'm in the middle of a conference

2898.24 --> 2903.2
i'm literally addressing him

2900.079 --> 2905.04
right now you don't time out

2903.2 --> 2906.64
somebody that i'm literally addressing

2905.04 --> 2910.5589999999997
at the moment

2906.64 --> 2912.5589999999997
okay don't do that

2910.559 --> 2915.8390000000004
seriously next time you're doing that

2912.559 --> 2915.8390000000004
i'm taking your wrench

2919.359 --> 2925.11
i know he was being a dick

2922.48 --> 2927.119
but yeah that's gonna happen

2925.11 --> 2929.119
[Music]

2927.119 --> 2942.0
you know i'm confronting him with

2929.119 --> 2945.28
something that's very painful

2942.0 --> 2945.28
what anyway

2946.16 --> 2950.5589999999997
do you think a man evolved from abe no

2951.839 --> 2957.839
that's ridiculous

2969.52 --> 2971.839
all right

2983.119 --> 2985.839
twilight

2986.1 --> 2992.96
[Music]

2988.48 --> 2997.359
evidence is completely overwhelmed

2992.96 --> 3000.0
yeah i think the evidence is overwhelmed

2997.359 --> 3001.52
that your faculties are not entirely

3000.0 --> 3013.52
stable

3001.52 --> 3027.839
twilight chick ian

3013.52 --> 3027.839
i think here you might be uh mutating

3029.73 --> 3032.929
[Music]

3050.24 --> 3059.4399999999996
really you have evolution

3054.4 --> 3062.7200000000003
data with mitochondrial dna do you

3059.44 --> 3066.0
i'm pretty sure that you don't

3062.72 --> 3069.839
i'm pretty sure that they don't evolve

3066.0 --> 3074.4
and that is why mitochondrial dna

3069.839 --> 3077.52
is so incredibly value for tracing back

3074.4 --> 3081.6800000000003
all kinds of things

3077.52 --> 3084.559
because it doesn't change

3081.68 --> 3084.5589999999997
you understand

3084.8 --> 3092.48
because it doesn't change

3089.119 --> 3095.76
you see it's very

3092.48 --> 3099.2
very difficult right they literally

3095.76 --> 3099.2000000000003
don't understand what they're saying

3100.559 --> 3111.8390000000004
it's very telling

3118.92 --> 3122.099
[Music]

3122.839 --> 3125.839
so

3150.839 --> 3153.839

mike fox you can just [ __ ] off

3316.94 --> 3319.989
[Music]

3323.29 --> 3327.849
[Music]

3332.839 --> 3335.839
so

3344.72 --> 3352.3999999999996
yeah or indifference look

3349.2 --> 3354.72
if people don't listen

3352.4 --> 3355.52
to the show and are just there in the

3354.72 --> 3358.8799999999997
chat to

3355.52 --> 3364.48
nag people then they get

3358.88 --> 3368.0
banned because i don't accept that

3364.48 --> 3370.319
and i test it out by addressing them

3368.0 --> 3371.68
and i give them some time i even spend a

3370.319 --> 3375.44
little time of my show

3371.68 --> 3377.7599999999998
and the focus to do that right

3375.44 --> 3381.28
so hey you want to be a baller you want

3377.76 --> 3381.28
to be in my chat that's fine

3381.599 --> 3388.1600000000003
but you have to listen

3385.76 --> 3390.079
because i will address people in chat

3388.16 --> 3391.1189999999997
including the ballers including very

3390.079 --> 3395.2000000000003
triggered people

3391.119 --> 3398.319
perhaps and misbehavior that i perceive

3395.2 --> 3400.0789999999997
from the flatter side because yeah we

3398.319 --> 3404.88
all want to lash out at times

3400.079 --> 3407.52
but i try to prevent that from happening

3404.88 --> 3410.1600000000003
to basically expose the natural

3407.52 --> 3413.04
reactions

3410.16 --> 3415.359
right and the squirting indeed dank you

3413.04 --> 3417.599
get it

3415.359 --> 3419.359

3417.599 --> 3422.319
said they were going to send me a paypal

3419.359 --> 3426.319
i might as just as well check that out

3422.319 --> 3429.599
and wow show is almost done

3426.319 --> 3433.839
that hour has certainly flown by

3429.599 --> 3433.839
it was very amusing today

3436.88 --> 3443.839
ah thank you very much dank

3440.72 --> 3446.72
that is most welcome

3443.839 --> 3448.24
i still really need it i'm glad that i

3446.72 --> 3451.9199999999996
didn't have to spend the

3448.24 --> 3454.64
extra time whining about that

3451.92 --> 3456.559
about money i did yesterday but it's

3454.64 --> 3460.4
really necessary i am really

3456.559 --> 3463.119
in some like bottom

3460.4 --> 3464.88
well it's not it's not going to horrific

3463.119 --> 3468.48
levels

3464.88 --> 3473.04
but yeah i'm kind of like in a

3468.48 --> 3476.2400000000002
audio in a valley with a suspected peak

3473.04 --> 3476.5589999999997
in the not too distant future but with

3476.24 --> 3479.68
no

3476.559 --> 3479.6800000000003
absolute certainty

3479.76 --> 3483.599
right so i still need to support and

3481.92 --> 3488.2400000000002
thank you very much for that

3483.599 --> 3490.559
dank i really appreciate it

3488.24 --> 3492.319
yeah thanks everyone else because i will

3490.559 --> 3494.7200000000003
round out the show right now

3492.319 --> 3497.04
right well maybe let's test first about

3494.72 --> 3500.5589999999997
exponential monk

3497.04 --> 3504.079
so exponential monk can you hear me

3500.559 --> 3506.6400000000003
if you can then say i can hear you arwin

3504.079 --> 3506.6400000000003
type it in

3508.0 --> 3511.28
you get 30 seconds

3512.319 --> 3517.839
no no say i can hear you

3520.96 --> 3523.76
it's close

3524.559 --> 3530.7200000000003
i can good there you go

3527.599 --> 3534.2400000000002
see now he can stay

3530.72 --> 3535.04
that's how it works see yes a psychics

3534.24 --> 3538.16
traveler

3535.04 --> 3539.119
i know you can hear me glad to have you

3538.16 --> 3541.2
in here

3539.119 --> 3542.96
but i am rounding out the show now make

3541.2 --> 3544.24
sure you saw my second email yes i have

3542.96 --> 3546.0
seen it

3544.24 --> 3548.72
yeah keep it up so you can start what

3546.0 --> 3548.72
it's interesting

3549.92 --> 3552.88
yes jimmy boy

3553.359 --> 3557.52
no no no i'm just i'm just keeping order

3556.4 --> 3560.4
in the front

3557.52 --> 3563.2
this has nothing to do with little g god

3560.4 --> 3565.92
i'm just keeping order

3563.2 --> 3566.48
right because when you keep order then

3565.92 --> 3569.44
things

3566.48 --> 3570.839
can grow then there is a certain

3569.44 --> 3573.76
reliability

3570.839 --> 3576.16
stability as a vantage point for

3573.76 --> 3577.92
productive activity you know if there's

3576.16 --> 3578.48
only chaos then there's nothing you can

3577.92 --> 3580.319
build

3578.48 --> 3582.559
you only end up defending yourself

3580.319 --> 3587.839
constantly and

3582.559 --> 3587.8390000000004
raging so it's all about order

3590.4 --> 3596.64
so what wow

3594.4 --> 3597.839
really have to make it sexual there

3596.64 --> 3601.44
exponential monk

3597.839 --> 3603.7599999999998
it's really petty i'm just trying to

3601.44 --> 3606.319
keep order here

3603.76 --> 3607.28
dude i just gave you pretty much a

3606.319 --> 3611.04
compliment for

3607.28 --> 3611.0400000000004
addressing me how is that

3611.2 --> 3616.64
is that so terrible

3614.559 --> 3618.7200000000003
do you act like that in a teacher to the

3616.64 --> 3621.52
teacher in your class as well

3618.72 --> 3623.1189999999997
when you ask like yes exponential monk

3621.52 --> 3625.7599999999998
or your real name

3623.119 --> 3628.0
are you present and you're just

3625.76 --> 3629.92
continuing your conversation right there

3628.0 --> 3631.599
with somebody you're just chatting on

3629.92 --> 3633.599
some kind of flat earth debate chat or

3631.599 --> 3636.559
something and you're not saying anything

3633.599 --> 3636.96
yeah he's gonna mark you down as absent

3636.559 --> 3638.48
right

3636.96 --> 3640.839
unless he sees you and then he might

3638.48 --> 3644.48
come up to you and say like hello

3640.839 --> 3647.04
hello can i have your attention please

3644.48 --> 3648.319
right that's not him having a small

3647.04 --> 3651.04
penis

3648.319 --> 3651.92
or being a tyrant that's just keeping

3651.04 --> 3655.119
order

3651.92 --> 3656.079
you understand so you don't have to act

3655.119 --> 3659.28
like a juvenile

3656.079 --> 3662.559
like that and just

3659.28 --> 3663.52
yeah just act appropriately and we can

3662.559 --> 3666.1600000000003
