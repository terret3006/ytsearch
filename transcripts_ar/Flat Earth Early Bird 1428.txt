I'm actually gonna

92.58 --> 98.759
be a little hungry today I think but

95.64 --> 103.7
that might also be because just

98.759 --> 103.7
a little Frosty night I had

104.22 --> 107.28
right

105.84 --> 109.86

it was all Frosty this night

115.68 --> 120.899

the cars and all that down there but

120.899 --> 125.52
yeah

121.979 --> 127.439
in the morning it kind of turned Misty

125.52 --> 129.179

it's

129.179 --> 132.25900000000001
it's raining

134.22 --> 138.739

blood sword

179.58 --> 187.519
not just because I was on it

183.239 --> 187.519

another program again

193.5 --> 198.62

[Music]

212.94 --> 215.48

216.84 --> 221.4
foreign

218.34 --> 224.0
so yeah yesterday

221.4 --> 224.0
I

224.099 --> 229.76
didn't go to bed super late but not very

226.799 --> 229.76000000000002
early either and

230.4 --> 233.06
uh

233.22 --> 236.78
thank God I got like this

237.36 --> 243.739
[Music]

240.48 --> 243.73899999999998
one of these things

244.62 --> 250.799
it's gonna feel up with fill up with hot

246.599 --> 252.83999999999997
water and it's like super nice when I'm

250.799 --> 255.08
like trying to go to bed when it's that

252.84 --> 255.08
cold

258.9 --> 265.73999999999995
so nice what a just a small little trick

262.56 --> 268.68
and do to improve your life

265.74 --> 272.639
because like getting in that bed

268.68 --> 276.32
I mean it's really cold when it's minus

272.639 --> 276.32
three degrees Celsius outside

276.419 --> 278.9
all right

281.34 --> 286.56
but I did have like a really nice

283.68 --> 289.08
chicken broccoli dinner again

286.56 --> 290.88
and that was very welcome I think like

289.08 --> 294.12
my body was like yeah give me that

290.88 --> 296.04
butter this is we need fat it's getting

294.12 --> 299.3
cold

296.04 --> 299.3
because yeah

299.4 --> 303.9
and I had a really long sleep this night

301.56 --> 306.72
too I mean I woke up

303.9 --> 309.0
like one o'clock totally did not expect

306.72 --> 311.1
that

309.0 --> 314.12
or like uh

311.1 --> 314.12
ten to one

315.419 --> 322.139
butter yeah yeah no I uh I basically

318.479 --> 325.25899999999996
slow fry my chicken in butter

322.139 --> 327.66
with lots of salt pepper and rosemary

325.259 --> 330.47900000000004
it's the best

327.66 --> 333.32000000000005
it is like the best

330.479 --> 333.32
great stuff

338.0 --> 344.759
then my body's really appreciating

342.419 --> 347.9
right and I don't even eat meat that

344.759 --> 347.90000000000003
often it's like

350.4 --> 354.56
I usually just have french fries

356.46 --> 361.19899999999996
and I am living on that partially which

359.82 --> 364.44
is kind of weird because I don't take

361.199 --> 367.979
much greens outside my supplements but

364.44 --> 372.96
it works as long as I have basically two

367.979 --> 375.68
more rounded meals a week roughly

372.96 --> 375.68
two or three

377.22 --> 382.639
with some meat and vegetables so that

379.32 --> 382.639
yeah that's working just fine

383.28 --> 387.13899999999995
hey Michael come good to see you

389.96 --> 395.52
greens yeah

392.52 --> 395.52
vegetables

396.6 --> 401.53900000000004
your roommate does all the cooking all

398.46 --> 401.539
Lucky Man

402.9 --> 409.25899999999996
yeah now I have a very very strict diet

406.319 --> 411.0
and I'm really at my own pace

409.259 --> 414.06
so

411.0 --> 416.4
cooking or like sharing cooking with

414.06 --> 418.8
somebody else is going to be difficult

416.4 --> 420.96999999999997
for me especially with the roommates

418.8 --> 423.24
here

420.97 --> 424.74
[Music]

423.24 --> 427.259
all right

424.74 --> 428.88
hey when I was living with my ex I was

427.259 --> 431.22
taking care of dinner I would always be

428.88 --> 434.52
on time and it would be great

431.22 --> 436.199
like if I if I am like responsible for

434.52 --> 439.68
somebody else

436.199 --> 443.66
then I will get less asymmetrical with

439.68 --> 443.66
my dinner habits right anyway

444.36 --> 449.16
making chicken vegetable soup right now

446.819 --> 451.139
nice ah

449.16 --> 453.53900000000004
damn it I didn't have any Illuminati

451.139 --> 454.919
cuss on this morning so I'm kind of

453.539 --> 457.58
hungry

454.919 --> 457.58
yeah

457.62 --> 464.66
did I get a new roommate yet no I did

460.86 --> 464.66
this is like a Bad season for it

466.139 --> 470.819
I mean most

467.639 --> 473.40000000000003
people like roommates are usually like

470.819 --> 476.03900000000004
students well they've already had to

473.4 --> 477.17999999999995
pretty much find a room

476.039 --> 480.419
so

477.18 --> 482.88
already deep into studying season and

480.419 --> 485.75899999999996
all that so

482.88 --> 489.18
it's tougher to find a new roommate

485.759 --> 492.399
but that will come eventually

489.18 --> 492.399
[Music]

492.72 --> 497.40000000000003
just even scream yeah

495.66 --> 500.58000000000004
all right yeah you're in the summer

497.4 --> 503.12
right now okay okay that makes sense

500.58 --> 503.12
I guess

504.07 --> 517.86
[Music]

515.94 --> 519.599
oh come on don't I'll start talking

517.86 --> 522.0
about food

519.599 --> 525.4200000000001
unless somebody gives me like a PayPal

522.0 --> 528.959
so I can actually have

525.42 --> 530.279
more elaborate dinner later or like a

528.959 --> 533.8389999999999
pizza

530.279 --> 533.8389999999999
for lunch that would be great

538.32 --> 543.24
bacon

541.019 --> 546.14
no I don't eat bacon

543.24 --> 546.14
I don't eat pig

549.54 --> 554.88
yeah by the way you've been watching own

551.94 --> 556.2600000000001
Benjamin oh Benjamin this week

554.88 --> 559.68
like

556.26 --> 562.2
had been like really on to like

559.68 --> 565.2199999999999
Paul from the Bible

562.2 --> 565.22
and it's awesome

566.459 --> 573.4799999999999
I'm very impressed and I agree and it is

569.399 --> 576.959
really like the original issue I had

573.48 --> 579.3000000000001
that I barely even knew how to grasp on

576.959 --> 582.92
solidly in my mind but I already felt

579.3 --> 582.92
like there's just things wrong here

584.519 --> 591.48
and Owen's been laying it out in great

587.519 --> 593.1
detail this is yeah very glad of it

591.48 --> 596.54
huh

593.1 --> 596.5400000000001
so that's been happening

603.959 --> 610.6199999999999
oh yeah Quantum eraser was live not a

607.26 --> 614.04
ball busters but the treatment QE life

610.62 --> 617.4590000000001
and it was hysterical I mean that show

614.04 --> 619.9399999999999
kind of kept me up and it was like

617.459 --> 623.399
because he was just in a funny mood

619.94 --> 627.12
laughing a lot not just like

623.399 --> 629.04
there you stupid idiots well he was but

627.12 --> 631.62
he was just having more fun with it and

629.04 --> 634.26
it was really great

631.62 --> 637.98
being in the chat there listening

634.26 --> 640.56
so if you just want to have like a fun

637.98 --> 643.38
cracking down on idiot anti-flat

640.56 --> 645.54
earthers show in this case an astronomer

643.38 --> 647.399
then that should I definitely recommend

645.54 --> 650.959
you watch it if you haven't because it's

647.399 --> 652.62
really funny and it's really funny

650.959 --> 655.079
laughs

652.62 --> 657.12
this astronomer guy just does so many

655.079 --> 659.2199999999999
incredibly stupid things and kiwi is

657.12 --> 661.14
like picking up on every single thing so

659.22 --> 663.1800000000001
he can't even

661.14 --> 665.579
sometimes he can't even just continue

663.18 --> 668.16
playing for like longer than five

665.579 --> 672.5
seconds before he starts laughing out

668.16 --> 672.5
loud again it's hysterical

672.779 --> 676.279
so check that out

676.92 --> 681.4
[Music]

683.519 --> 687.6

YouTube it's Damian traveler I only

692.76 --> 696.079

mm-hmm

703.2 --> 708.48
I don't really have a favorite YouTuber

705.779 --> 712.579
I mean there's some great YouTubers but

708.48 --> 712.5790000000001
even the great like ups and downs

715.38 --> 719.04
Great Moments less Great Moments well

717.839 --> 721.0790000000001
you have to have it from the Great

719.04 --> 723.5
Moments but

721.079 --> 723.5
anyway

726.74 --> 734.0
okay it says actually on the television

730.82 --> 734.0
all right

734.7 --> 737.4200000000001

742.26 --> 745.9399999999999
I'm just gonna get on television with it

747.0 --> 749.54
cool

750.959 --> 755.529
right

751.74 --> 755.529
[Music]

756.779 --> 763.1
hey Mike sirunich

758.94 --> 763.1
and Tarot 306 could see you

774.36 --> 780.36
right yeah I was very busy yesterday

777.839 --> 783.7790000000001
I was also a stream from Martin

780.36 --> 786.24
who had this guy on

783.779 --> 789.12
and that guy just

786.24 --> 792.12
oh

789.12 --> 794.339
I mean I went off on that guy

792.12 --> 796.44
I'm lucky that that Martin didn't

794.339 --> 800.4590000000001
actually like take my wrench away

796.44 --> 803.4590000000001
because I was like I hate that guy

800.459 --> 807.54
and I mean hate

803.459 --> 809.579
that guy was so [ __ ] [ __ ] and

807.54 --> 813.0
such a blabbermouth

809.579 --> 816.42
cussing and swearing for no damn reason

813.0 --> 818.7
all the time he was disgusting it's like

816.42 --> 821.0999999999999
the worst combination of different

818.7 --> 823.76
characters I've seen like in social

821.1 --> 827.22
media like the worst combination

823.76 --> 830.279
possible of Trades it's like the worst

827.22 --> 833.0400000000001
at gerund and the worst of like what's

830.279 --> 835.7
that guy called again ugh

833.04 --> 835.6999999999999
uh

836.279 --> 842.88
I keep forgetting just all these

839.579 --> 845.2199999999999
terrible behaviors all into one I can't

842.88 --> 847.459
believe that Martin actually like that

845.22 --> 847.4590000000001
guy

848.279 --> 852.36
or maybe he was just like oh I'm gonna

850.86 --> 855.92
have this guest on whatever's gonna

852.36 --> 855.92
happen is gonna happen I don't know

855.959 --> 864.06
but that guy was a full-blown idiot in

861.36 --> 867.0600000000001
many ways and I it was surprising that

864.06 --> 868.8
he even said some sensible things here

867.06 --> 871.38
and there

868.8 --> 873.4799999999999
but he's like a blabbermouth repeater

871.38 --> 875.22
and he literally doesn't understand what

873.48 --> 878.94
he's talking about because the second

875.22 --> 881.279
you actually inquire him to explain what

878.94 --> 883.44
he's talking about he's immediately just

881.279 --> 888.959
gonna break

883.44 --> 893.48
I hate that guy get the [ __ ] out

888.959 --> 893.4799999999999
you misleading idiot

893.88 --> 896.6
uh

897.66 --> 901.3199999999999
right and yeah I do a little swearing

900.0 --> 905.339
here and there

901.32 --> 907.6990000000001
but I don't just start oh [ __ ] this

905.339 --> 910.6800000000001
[ __ ] that and just look real stupid

907.699 --> 913.079
New World Order we're gonna get you like

910.68 --> 914.2199999999999
out of nowhere I mean that's just a

913.079 --> 917.519
[ __ ]

914.22 --> 920.1600000000001
it's a [ __ ] dude like really stupid

917.519 --> 922.5
person somebody that you're like no no

920.16 --> 924.8389999999999
we don't want you in our group you're a

922.5 --> 927.959
[ __ ] [ __ ] and a terrible influence

924.839 --> 930.86
get the [ __ ] out

927.959 --> 930.8599999999999
ah

931.019 --> 935.519
what the hell was he called again

932.66 --> 938.6
zetelic perspective or something God

935.519 --> 938.6
damn it what an idiot

939.18 --> 942.4399999999999
like yes

943.139 --> 949.8
yes or but maybe it could be because he

947.399 --> 952.56
just never really goes live I really

949.8 --> 955.62
hope that's it because then it might be

952.56 --> 957.1199999999999
just like the Newbie attitude where he

955.62 --> 959.94
basically doesn't really know how to

957.12 --> 963.0600000000001
compose himself I really hope that's it

959.94 --> 964.019
because if this guy is like this all the

963.06 --> 967.1389999999999
time

964.019 --> 970.139
then literally every person that follows

967.139 --> 972.3
him I guarantee our Winnie and guarantee

970.139 --> 975.3
I even typed it out in chat You're Gonna

972.3 --> 978.12
Lose at least 40 IQ points within half a

975.3 --> 979.459
year if you actually follow that guy I

978.12 --> 984.199
guarantee it

979.459 --> 987.3
guarantee measurable guarantee

984.199 --> 990.56
right so safe to say I didn't really

987.3 --> 990.56
care much for the guy

990.78 --> 996.279
[Music]

1002.36 --> 1005.8000000000001
I don't have verbal diarrhea yeah thank

1004.759 --> 1009.759
God

1005.8 --> 1012.139
I mean swearing has a time and a place

1009.759 --> 1015.019
swearing is like

1012.139 --> 1017.779
is like the extra intense color to paint

1015.019 --> 1020.72
that you just put in the painting just

1017.779 --> 1022.22
to give it a little extra robust shine

1020.72 --> 1026.24
or something right

1022.22 --> 1029.6000000000001
it's not like look and then oh yeah I

1026.24 --> 1031.22
also have a point somehow no no that

1029.6 --> 1033.4389999999999
just makes you look like a complete

1031.22 --> 1035.98
[ __ ]

1033.439 --> 1035.98
anyway

1037.3 --> 1043.78
[Music]

1040.22 --> 1043.78
so yeah I've been busy yesterday

1044.419 --> 1048.38
but there were overall interesting

1046.16 --> 1051.0800000000002
streams flat side stream was interesting

1048.38 --> 1053.5400000000002
kiwis stream was amazing

1051.08 --> 1056.74
and Martin's stream well was interesting

1053.54 --> 1056.74
in another type of way

1058.34 --> 1065.0
did a terrible way but I mean it was

1060.98 --> 1067.78
still yeah basically worthy enough to

1065.0 --> 1071.72
hang around and just criticize in chat

1067.78 --> 1074.66
with other people being like Oh who are

1071.72 --> 1076.88
you to ju like you shouldn't be judging

1074.66 --> 1079.539
that person and they're like I'll be the

1076.88 --> 1079.5390000000002
judge of that

1081.02 --> 1087.799
like what you're gonna stop me from

1083.059 --> 1090.799
judging people really I don't think so

1087.799 --> 1090.799
foreign

1092.53 --> 1096.6399999999999
[Music]

1098.78 --> 1103.6399999999999
you could kick me out of the chat even

1101.84 --> 1105.86
though I had a wrench Martin didn't

1103.64 --> 1107.539
really seem to mind that much or didn't

1105.86 --> 1109.9399999999998
really read the chat and then when he

1107.539 --> 1113.059
started to you apparently it had already

1109.94 --> 1115.4
scrolled out of out of sight it was just

1113.059 --> 1118.059
probably for the best

1115.4 --> 1118.0590000000002
uh

1118.7 --> 1122.0800000000002
went pretty rough on him

1122.36 --> 1124.539
thank you

1129.86 --> 1134.9189999999999
all right so yeah that was pretty much

1132.02 --> 1134.9189999999999
my day yesterday

1136.69 --> 1140.249
[Music]

1149.24 --> 1155.179
I mean all of those streams pretty much

1151.34 --> 1158.1399999999999
filled up the day and even the night so

1155.179 --> 1158.14
all right

1163.82 --> 1167.1299999999999
what was your show about again yesterday

1165.86 --> 1168.559
flat side

1167.13 --> 1172.1200000000001
[Music]

1168.559 --> 1172.12
I can of course look it up

1181.94 --> 1186.039
the theme was control

1186.98 --> 1192.44
right yeah I think you had a lot of yeah

1189.44 --> 1196.3400000000001
I remember now Buzz aldrawn at Neil

1192.44 --> 1196.3400000000001
deGrasse Tyson interviews

1197.48 --> 1200.559
it was pretty funny

1201.86 --> 1207.4399999999998
like finally reviewing Buzz Aldrin and I

1205.039 --> 1211.58
am kind of happy that I did it yeah that

1207.44 --> 1214.1000000000001
I was able to give my analysis invoice

1211.58 --> 1216.559
because I really do fit like in a weird

1214.1 --> 1218.4189999999999
way I do kind of sympathize with with

1216.559 --> 1220.82
Buzz

1218.419 --> 1222.7990000000002
it just feels like he's trapped and he's

1220.82 --> 1224.299
still trying to kind of wizard his way

1222.799 --> 1226.8799999999999
out

1224.299 --> 1229.039
in a benevolent way I mean

1226.88 --> 1231.98
there's nothing malevolent relief about

1229.039 --> 1235.24
that guy he's really trying to be a good

1231.98 --> 1235.24
guy but he's just trapped

1235.82 --> 1237.9399999999998
um

1238.46 --> 1240.88
anyway

1244.0 --> 1250.36
Pepsi where's my Jets

1246.919 --> 1250.3600000000001
that sounds terrible

1254.679 --> 1260.3200000000002
oh is that like another documentary or

1258.14 --> 1260.3200000000002
something

1260.66 --> 1267.46
okay

1262.88 --> 1267.46
no I haven't really bumped into it yet

1270.08 --> 1275.26
I'm still letting like 18.99 digest for

1273.02 --> 1275.26
a while

1275.72 --> 1279.039
it was a pretty good series

1282.919 --> 1286.1000000000001
based on the truth yeah yeah no I get it

1284.96 --> 1288.74
I get it

1286.1 --> 1292.48
I think it's like one of those

1288.74 --> 1292.48
documentary thingies right

1302.0 --> 1305.98
wow that's a pretty high score there

1308.72 --> 1314.48
oh wait no it is it is actually a

1312.34 --> 1315.74
dramatized movie

1314.48 --> 1319.6
okay

1315.74 --> 1319.6
okay what a weird title

1322.7 --> 1325.299
all right

1329.179 --> 1334.8200000000002
you've just watched that watched what

1332.38 --> 1338.3200000000002
1899 or

1334.82 --> 1338.32
Pepsi where's my jet

1339.86 --> 1346.1
not a dramatizer oh what okay that's

1343.28 --> 1348.6789999999999
kind of what it sounded like

1346.1 --> 1352.059
so it is just a documentary about the

1348.679 --> 1352.0590000000002
court situation and all that

1359.179 --> 1363.2
okay fine

1360.919 --> 1366.5590000000002
maybe I'll bump into it

1363.2 --> 1369.2
ah right yeah Michael come

1366.559 --> 1371.5
right this is pretty mind-blowing wasn't

1369.2 --> 1371.5
it

1372.58 --> 1375.77
[Music]

1376.46 --> 1380.9
I mean at some point you really get the

1378.62 --> 1382.8799999999999
idea like oh [ __ ] this is the situation

1380.9 --> 1385.52
that's already complex enough and then

1382.88 --> 1388.64
it like moves to the next level and then

1385.52 --> 1392.74
another level and you're like bless

1388.64 --> 1392.74
the [ __ ] is going on here

1392.96 --> 1396.6200000000001
ah

1394.64 --> 1399.8600000000001
yeah

1396.62 --> 1402.86
but just they really know how to like

1399.86 --> 1405.02
pull your curiosity in that series there

1402.86 --> 1407.4189999999999
that's what they focused on a lot and

1405.02 --> 1411.34
they're they did a great job

1407.419 --> 1411.3400000000001
great job great actors

1412.22 --> 1418.64
I really liked how they actually had

1414.88 --> 1422.0590000000002
multi-language just in the actual scene

1418.64 --> 1424.64
and that's just fascinating

1422.059 --> 1427.6399999999999
kind of like a little bit like what

1424.64 --> 1435.65
blueberry had but much more

1427.64 --> 1435.65
[Music]

1439.1 --> 1442.9399999999998
Infinity

1441.44 --> 1445.8200000000002
what

1442.94 --> 1448.46
not bad okay

1445.82 --> 1451.1789999999999
you manage to watch your movie wow is

1448.46 --> 1451.179
that that hard

1452.0 --> 1456.88
yeah the beetle right yeah awesome

1454.039 --> 1456.8799999999999
little creature

1457.159 --> 1460.8200000000002
and I don't know what kind of beetle

1459.02 --> 1463.039
that is I mean it it kind of looked like

1460.82 --> 1465.26
a dung beetle but it was weird green and

1463.039 --> 1467.419
all that I've never seen one of those

1465.26 --> 1468.62
they're usually like this dark

1467.419 --> 1470.7800000000002
blue

1468.62 --> 1475.039
purplish

1470.78 --> 1475.039
but yeah it was pretty cool overall

1478.419 --> 1483.8600000000001
but at first and I I can't basically say

1482.179 --> 1486.3200000000002
I could have said that yesterday but but

1483.86 --> 1488.4189999999999
I can say today too because it's not

1486.32 --> 1489.62
really a spoilers I guess because I

1488.419 --> 1491.96
already

1489.62 --> 1495.9799999999998
said like oh it's not a time thing but I

1491.96 --> 1497.919
thought that the kid and the

1495.98 --> 1500.78
well and the other

1497.919 --> 1503.539
interloper guy

1500.78 --> 1505.52
who also uses that bug by the way if

1503.539 --> 1507.32
you've noticed that I thought that they

1505.52 --> 1508.58
were the same person like stuck in a

1507.32 --> 1510.74
Time Loop

1508.58 --> 1513.799
but I guess that that was like a very

1510.74 --> 1517.299
early on card they wanted to hand out

1513.799 --> 1517.299
for you to think that

1518.96 --> 1524.0
but yeah it was cool the whole thing it

1522.08 --> 1526.22
was like a big puzzle

1524.0 --> 1528.919
and I really liked I I I'm probably

1526.22 --> 1532.52
gonna watch it back at some point

1528.919 --> 1535.45
see what it's like to watch it again but

1532.52 --> 1538.22
I'm gonna give it some space

1535.45 --> 1540.26
[Music]

1538.22 --> 1543.14
yeah first episode was slow yeah but it

1540.26 --> 1547.94
was like the first episode was purely to

1543.14 --> 1550.88
set the tone right of what the time the

1547.94 --> 1551.96
times are like and it did that really

1550.88 --> 1554.1200000000001
well

1551.96 --> 1555.8600000000001
but then just as the series progresses

1554.12 --> 1559.1
it just completely

1555.86 --> 1562.4189999999999
will not abandon it but just Maneuvers

1559.1 --> 1562.4189999999999
away from that more and more

1562.89 --> 1566.269
[Music]

1572.9 --> 1577.22
but I actually kind of like the slow

1575.0 --> 1580.1
pace of the first one

1577.22 --> 1582.38
because it's not so like oh we're trying

1580.1 --> 1584.539
to be entertaining oh we're like an

1582.38 --> 1586.22
exaggerated version of what we think it

1584.539 --> 1589.0
was like no no it was all just very

1586.22 --> 1592.34
serious very in the mindset of the times

1589.0 --> 1593.539
of that time and I was really impressed

1592.34 --> 1598.0
by that

1593.539 --> 1598.0
I thought it was really well reenacted

1599.84 --> 1605.8999999999999
it looked like the Titanic yeah big

1603.08 --> 1609.559
I did think like is this gonna be like a

1605.9 --> 1611.72
sort of Titanic Story a Titanic mystery

1609.559 --> 1613.22
story which would be great by the way as

1611.72 --> 1617.6000000000001
a movie

1613.22 --> 1620.059
but yeah anyway let's not try this uh

1617.6 --> 1623.799
try the spoiler too much for other

1620.059 --> 1623.799
people that still want to watch it

1624.559 --> 1631.1589999999999
just enjoy it and keep it to yourself

1628.34 --> 1633.9599999999998
at least the content

1631.159 --> 1636.38
especially don't spoil the end uh

1633.96 --> 1638.539
[Music]

1636.38 --> 1642.22
oh you have to go

1638.539 --> 1642.22
all right flat side see you later

1647.179 --> 1650.66
yeah

1648.5 --> 1654.32
okay Michael Khan we get it

1650.66 --> 1657.38
[Music]

1654.32 --> 1659.6789999999999
just don't talk about the content too

1657.38 --> 1659.679
much

1662.96 --> 1666.279
just enjoy it

1668.09 --> 1673.33
[Music]

1679.1 --> 1683.6
I don't know steamy traveler if he is

1681.38 --> 1686.5590000000002
completely supporting himself by YouTube

1683.6 --> 1686.559
alone I mean

1687.14 --> 1692.5700000000002
it's a pretty good Channel but

1689.08 --> 1692.57
[Music]

1694.22 --> 1700.419
I think flat side probably has other

1697.159 --> 1700.419
jobs on the side too

1701.9 --> 1706.67
I don't know if I haven't actually asked

1703.88 --> 1709.969
him anyway he's already left so

1706.67 --> 1709.969
[Music]

1713.419 --> 1719.5300000000002
um what

1714.68 --> 1719.53
[Music]

1728.36 --> 1732.1
hey I remember you

1735.2 --> 1737.38
thank you

1739.52 --> 1743.9
what are we talking about

1742.159 --> 1746.419
I don't know what you're talking about

1743.9 --> 1749.539
but I was talking about all the awesome

1746.419 --> 1752.96
streams from yesterday

1749.539 --> 1757.279
flat zoids I was part of it I was on the

1752.96 --> 1758.96
panel QE live which was hilarious it was

1757.279 --> 1760.76
really funny

1758.96 --> 1762.74
I mean that was like one of the most

1760.76 --> 1764.0
entertaining QE live shows I've ever

1762.74 --> 1766.7
witnessed

1764.0 --> 1768.08
it was just him reviewing a ridiculous

1766.7 --> 1770.8400000000001
astronomer

1768.08 --> 1774.74
live stream

1770.84 --> 1778.6399999999999
really funny really and uh

1774.74 --> 1781.159
and yeah less entertaining but still

1778.64 --> 1782.8400000000001
entertaining in another way Martin's

1781.159 --> 1785.2990000000002
stream where I went ballistic against

1782.84 --> 1789.3799999999999
this guy he had on who I absolutely

1785.299 --> 1791.3799999999999
despise for very meticulously laid out

1789.38 --> 1793.46
reasons

1791.38 --> 1797.6000000000001
I'm not going to go through all that

1793.46 --> 1802.58
again and then we started talking about

1797.6 --> 1802.58
uh series and movies

1804.32 --> 1809.6589999999999
and a series that I have recently

1806.299 --> 1813.679
watched in michaelcom 2 1899 on Netflix

1809.659 --> 1816.0200000000002
and it's really good but it is like you

1813.679 --> 1818.96
gotta if you watch it or even if you're

1816.02 --> 1822.1399999999999
like at halfway watching it it's it's

1818.96 --> 1824.3600000000001
tough because it everything changes so

1822.14 --> 1826.5800000000002
much what happens in there you just got

1824.36 --> 1828.9799999999998
to be careful not to start spoiling it

1826.58 --> 1833.059
for other people that haven't

1828.98 --> 1836.24
I mean it is kind of spoiler prone

1833.059 --> 1838.22
so I just recommend you just watch that

1836.24 --> 1840.32
and then keep it to yourself

1838.22 --> 1842.48
because it's going to be very tough to

1840.32 --> 1844.48
explain things about it without somehow

1842.48 --> 1847.46
spoiling it

1844.48 --> 1849.799
I've done my best I think to try to

1847.46 --> 1851.8990000000001
avoid it and only hook into the the

1849.799 --> 1853.82
first impression type things about it in

1851.899 --> 1857.539
like the first three episodes

1853.82 --> 1860.48
and bypassing the content the in content

1857.539 --> 1863.419
alterations that happen after that but

1860.48 --> 1865.3990000000001
yeah not everybody has that talent to do

1863.419 --> 1869.26
that

1865.399 --> 1869.26
so that's what we've been talking about

1873.86 --> 1879.58
plan for Christmas of the usual steamy

1877.279 --> 1879.58
Traveler

1880.7 --> 1885.3990000000001
uh I'll go to my dad's and stepmoms

1885.74 --> 1892.94
and a nice Christmas dinner

1889.22 --> 1896.539
I love it it sounds a bit weird but

1892.94 --> 1901.279
that's like the one time I basically

1896.539 --> 1904.1589999999999
get out of this house out of my city

1901.279 --> 1907.039
and one time a year

1904.159 --> 1909.0200000000002
but it's a very set necessary one time a

1907.039 --> 1911.36
year not because it's Christmas but

1909.02 --> 1915.98
because I just really like

1911.36 --> 1919.82
doing it and my stepmom really

1915.98 --> 1923.3600000000001
makes massive massive effort every year

1919.82 --> 1926.72
to dress up for Christmas like she has

1923.36 --> 1929.3799999999999
the most amazing

1926.72 --> 1929.38
things

1929.539 --> 1934.1
I mean if you're gonna get in there it's

1931.7 --> 1938.24
gonna look like a high standard look

1934.1 --> 1942.52
serious Christmas themed place

1938.24 --> 1942.52
a high standard I love it it's beautiful

1945.14 --> 1949.269
all right

1946.21 --> 1949.269
[Music]

1952.64 --> 1956.98
so that's what I'm doing for Christmas

1954.2 --> 1956.98
as usual

1958.0 --> 1964.7
what the [ __ ] is you're talking about

1960.98 --> 1967.419
Pokemon show what

1964.7 --> 1967.419
foreign

1968.32 --> 1973.52
trip no not really

1971.6 --> 1976.779
it's like

1973.52 --> 1976.779
20 minute drive

1982.279 --> 1987.98
I just really don't actually go anywhere

1985.22 --> 1990.2
well I haven't since I don't no longer

1987.98 --> 1993.76
have my car

1990.2 --> 1993.76
which has been for

1994.34 --> 1997.9599999999998
like four years now

1999.38 --> 2003.7600000000002
more

2001.84 --> 2006.22
five years

2003.76 --> 2008.74
God how would the time has flown I can't

2006.22 --> 2011.519
believe it I can't believe I'm already

2008.74 --> 2011.519
here so long

2018.46 --> 2027.76
[Music]

2036.58 --> 2039.84
sounds nice yeah

2043.24 --> 2048.7
but Christmas is still uh some time away

2046.659 --> 2051.119
so I'm not going to be already focused

2048.7 --> 2051.1189999999997
on that

2053.619 --> 2058.09
oh wait whoa it's already oh my God the

2057.28 --> 2059.26
20th yeah

2058.09 --> 2061.2400000000002
[Music]

2059.26 --> 2065.5200000000004
okay so it's like

2061.24 --> 2065.52
a little over a month away huh

2066.94 --> 2069.94
foreign

2090.32 --> 2093.559
[Music]

2094.3 --> 2097.7400000000002
so yeah how are you guys doing

2103.24 --> 2109.359
any feedback on my show from yesterday

2106.839 --> 2112.54
I mean I thought that my no reset State

2109.359 --> 2115.06
of Mind concept was pretty

2112.54 --> 2117.16
yeah

2115.06 --> 2119.2599999999998
it was like so simple it's almost

2117.16 --> 2121.66
embarrassing but it is really kind of

2119.26 --> 2125.26
relevant

2121.66 --> 2128.94
a higher level approach

2125.26 --> 2132.82
and also I really liked like how I

2128.94 --> 2135.579
refined my conception of meteors I'm

2132.82 --> 2138.6400000000003
very like on board with what came out of

2135.579 --> 2142.0
that I really think I got it I think I

2138.64 --> 2143.5789999999997
actually figured out meteors

2142.0 --> 2149.26
now

2143.579 --> 2150.82
how do you get up close somehow to see

2149.26 --> 2155.079
it right

2150.82 --> 2158.2000000000003
I mean could you imagine how amazing it

2155.079 --> 2161.38
would be if somehow

2158.2 --> 2164.02
you're able to like get a a balloon or a

2161.38 --> 2165.46
high-tech Zeppelin and then with a very

2164.02 --> 2167.32
special

2165.46 --> 2171.339
I don't know camera

2167.32 --> 2173.6800000000003
to like be able to yeah what if it could

2171.339 --> 2177.52
be possible not to reach like the

2173.68 --> 2181.2999999999997
firmament but actually be able to see it

2177.52 --> 2183.64
to see where there is irregate to

2181.3 --> 2185.8
actually see like the structure of it or

2183.64 --> 2188.2
something right because there's gonna be

2185.8 --> 2190.6600000000003
meteor sediment on there

2188.2 --> 2193.7999999999997
what if you could actually have a camera

2190.66 --> 2193.7999999999997
view on it

2194.68 --> 2203.14
and then to see how a meteorite

2199.9 --> 2205.48
would basically spring into being on

2203.14 --> 2209.04
camera up close

2205.48 --> 2209.04
now that would be amazing

2210.64 --> 2214.2999999999997
you might need like a high speed camera

2212.68 --> 2218.94
for that

2214.3 --> 2218.94
so it would not be an easy operation

2220.42 --> 2223.54
far up do you think someone has to get

2222.4 --> 2225.94
well

2223.54 --> 2228.599
that's the trick isn't it

2225.94 --> 2230.619
I mean you can't get up all the way

2228.599 --> 2233.56
definitely not

2230.619 --> 2236.6800000000003
but you can get up pretty high and then

2233.56 --> 2239.38
after you're up that high there is less

2236.68 --> 2243.22
gas in between you and whatever you're

2239.38 --> 2247.1400000000003
looking at to obstruct up there

2243.22 --> 2247.14
so what if you could like

2248.02 --> 2252.16
like put up the contrast or something

2250.72 --> 2254.5
right

2252.16 --> 2256.42
so that you could what normally would

2254.5 --> 2258.4
just look like oh the top and everything

2256.42 --> 2262.54
is black up there right

2258.4 --> 2264.099
well what if it isn't exactly perfectly

2262.54 --> 2267.46
equally black

2264.099 --> 2270.88
what if you were like really zoomed in

2267.46 --> 2275.579
and then like try to contrast it maybe

2270.88 --> 2275.579
you'll start to see like a structure

2275.859 --> 2281.74
for starters I dude this is just

2278.26 --> 2285.78
literally popping on out of nothing

2281.74 --> 2285.7799999999997
but yeah that might be possible

2292.3 --> 2298.54
I don't know how far that would be it

2294.4 --> 2302.4
would be very far I mean how far can a

2298.54 --> 2302.4
balloon go up you know

2303.64 --> 2310.42
and it would have to carry equipment

2307.66 --> 2313.96
like a camera a good one not just a

2310.42 --> 2315.46
cheap lightweight one

2313.96 --> 2318.52
because you're gonna have to perform

2315.46 --> 2322.44
some pretty detailed

2318.52 --> 2322.44
Zoom ins and all that so yeah

2322.48 --> 2326.38
I don't know man I don't know if it is

2324.339 --> 2328.9
feasible

2326.38 --> 2332.32
but it is an idea and that's what I'm

2328.9 --> 2334.78
here for ideas good ideas that actually

2332.32 --> 2338.2200000000003
have a point whether they're feasible or

2334.78 --> 2338.2200000000003
not yeah that's the question

2339.76 --> 2346.8390000000004
a large aperture telescope why in a

2343.72 --> 2346.839
mountain Maybe

2347.56 --> 2352.02
but the problem is is that

2355.66 --> 2358.5989999999997
yeah

2356.8 --> 2363.3
um

2358.599 --> 2363.3
no that's actually a good point

2363.4 --> 2367.78
yeah would you actually get access to

2365.56 --> 2369.88
one of those I mean they're all in

2367.78 --> 2372.88
Jesuit hats literally

2369.88 --> 2372.88
so

2375.52 --> 2380.2599999999998
I mean if you're gonna go there like hey

2377.859 --> 2382.72
I want to check out if there is a

2380.26 --> 2384.82
Surface structure on the firmament that

2382.72 --> 2386.7999999999997
encloses us there's a good chance

2384.82 --> 2390.3
they're gonna tell you get the [ __ ] out

2386.8 --> 2390.3
if you know what I mean

2393.92 --> 2397.66
[Music]

2395.5 --> 2400.0
all those things have mostly been there

2397.66 --> 2402.24
to reinforce

2400.0 --> 2406.599
that the Earth is a globe in outer space

2402.24 --> 2409.06
so that's probably prioritize over their

2406.599 --> 2411.7000000000003
actual mechanical functioning

2409.06 --> 2414.4
I'm not joking I think that all those

2411.7 --> 2418.5989999999997
telescope things are really there

2414.4 --> 2419.92
more to reinforce the idea that there is

2418.599 --> 2421.3
outer space and that they're doing

2419.92 --> 2424.78
something with it

2421.3 --> 2427.0
then that they're actually performing

2424.78 --> 2428.92
functions

2427.0 --> 2431.5
I think a lot of these telescopes are

2428.92 --> 2433.599
just sitting dots like they're

2431.5 --> 2435.45
collecting dust literally nobody ever

2433.599 --> 2442.44
does anything with them

2435.45 --> 2444.8799999999997
[Music]

2442.44 --> 2448.02
but uh yeah

2444.88 --> 2451.119
what are stars lights

2448.02 --> 2452.9
non-local holographic lights

2451.119 --> 2456.2200000000003
have no position in space

2452.9 --> 2459.94
[Music]

2456.22 --> 2462.0989999999997
I only have an angular position in

2459.94 --> 2464.68
relation to the Observer wherever they

2462.099 --> 2467.4
are in a very specific consistent

2464.68 --> 2467.3999999999996
fashion

2469.42 --> 2477.52
a skeptic 936 good CMM

2472.45 --> 2482.4399999999996
[Music]

2477.52 --> 2482.44
you're a remotely rent telescopes

2482.859 --> 2485.5789999999997
sure

2485.68 --> 2490.2999999999997
I mean that that couldn't be altered or

2488.619 --> 2492.88
anything at all I mean they could

2490.3 --> 2494.7400000000002
literally just simulate a telescope and

2492.88 --> 2496.839
not actually give you a telescope

2494.74 --> 2498.5789999999997
because they already made up their minds

2496.839 --> 2500.56
exactly what they want you to be able to

2498.579 --> 2502.3590000000004
see out there

2500.56 --> 2505.24
right

2502.359 --> 2507.7599999999998
so you'll just get a digital system not

2505.24 --> 2510.16
the actual telescope

2507.76 --> 2513.7000000000003
right if they really mean it they might

2510.16 --> 2516.72
even include an actual photograph of the

2513.7 --> 2516.72
telescope inside

2518.32 --> 2523.06
but

2519.88 --> 2524.619
I mean if digital access well that means

2523.06 --> 2526.66
they're probably just giving you a

2524.619 --> 2529.859
simulator

2526.66 --> 2529.859
I'm not even joking

2530.32 --> 2534.3
I mean the switch would be too easy

2534.44 --> 2539.64
[Music]

2537.64 --> 2542.8399999999997
what about star from it what about them

2539.64 --> 2542.8399999999997
[Music]

2557.26 --> 2559.8590000000004
foreign

2596.079 --> 2598.26
thank you

2599.859 --> 2603.06
very interesting

2604.24 --> 2610.359
they do seem to be

2607.0 --> 2614.44
using actual

2610.359 --> 2616.92
filming in that huh

2614.44 --> 2616.92
all right

2620.619 --> 2629.2000000000003
thanks for that add link see me Traveler

2625.599 --> 2631.6600000000003
thanks a lot but yeah sure

2629.2 --> 2633.64
I want to grabbing oh somebody wants to

2631.66 --> 2636.64
get mad get the [ __ ] out

2633.64 --> 2639.16
yeah to prove a position

2636.64 --> 2641.2
show me the angular size increase as you

2639.16 --> 2642.64
approach that assumed to be physical

2641.2 --> 2643.7799999999997
object

2642.64 --> 2645.94
yeah

2643.78 --> 2650.8590000000004
you don't have anything

2645.94 --> 2653.98
I only have angular sightings that's all

2650.859 --> 2656.56
none of them are actually traceable to a

2653.98 --> 2659.56
literal position within any space

2656.56 --> 2659.56
anywhere

2661.18 --> 2665.52
so as far as I'm concerned they're

2663.579 --> 2671.3390000000004
holographic

2665.52 --> 2674.98
[Music]

2671.339 --> 2677.859
if the Earth is flat why do we not see

2674.98 --> 2680.38
all the formations at the why would we

2677.859 --> 2682.68
see all the formations if the Earth is

2680.38 --> 2682.6800000000003
flat

2683.38 --> 2685.98
I mean

2686.56 --> 2692.74
the celestial

2688.44 --> 2694.619
Demi sphere does present itself as a

2692.74 --> 2697.8999999999996
sphere

2694.619 --> 2700.859
unrelated to whatever shape you assume

2697.9 --> 2700.859
the Earth to be

2702.339 --> 2708.4
to assume that you would see all the

2705.339 --> 2710.74
stars because the Earth is flat means

2708.4 --> 2713.819
you literally do not understand what the

2710.74 --> 2713.819
hell you're even looking at

2717.7 --> 2722.319
you're assuming that oh whatever you're

2719.98 --> 2725.56
gonna see is gonna be completely

2722.319 --> 2728.07
different then well you just have no

2725.56 --> 2731.389
idea what the hell is going on

2728.07 --> 2731.389
[Music]

2731.92 --> 2738.04
I mean we see what we see the Earth is

2734.74 --> 2743.2
flat Black Swan The Horizon is not the

2738.04 --> 2744.94
geometry of the assumed to be globe

2743.2 --> 2748.2999999999997
it's flat

2744.94 --> 2750.579
that's final it's done and after that

2748.3 --> 2752.44
point yeah oh now you're like oh what

2750.579 --> 2754.319
about the celestial sphere but that's a

2752.44 --> 2757.06
sphere yeah it is yeah it's a sphere

2754.319 --> 2758.2
congratulations the celestial sphere is

2757.06 --> 2761.5
a sphere

2758.2 --> 2764.6189999999997
it's a sphere in maps it looks like a

2761.5 --> 2766.78
sphere it spins around you like a sphere

2764.619 --> 2770.92
but guess what

2766.78 --> 2774.6400000000003
it's a holographic spectacle they're not

2770.92 --> 2777.819
physical things in physical positions

2774.64 --> 2780.94
and that includes the sun yeah there

2777.819 --> 2783.04
might be a lot of light arriving

2780.94 --> 2785.68
getting absorbed at ground level and all

2783.04 --> 2790.599
that from that sun especially but it is

2785.68 --> 2794.3799999999997
not a object in a position anywhere

2790.599 --> 2798.0
it's just a holographic spectacle and a

2794.38 --> 2798.0
lot of light arriving

2804.95 --> 2808.14
[Music]

2810.099 --> 2815.2200000000003
yeah I think Nemo is a bit of a

2812.619 --> 2815.2200000000003
ball-tarted

2822.64 --> 2830.319
I just explained you no no no and your

2826.96 --> 2831.46
information is seven years out of the

2830.319 --> 2832.66
day

2831.46 --> 2834.819
yeah

2832.66 --> 2836.74
we kind of moved on from these

2834.819 --> 2839.92
ridiculous assertions

2836.74 --> 2843.339
as in we completely figured out every

2839.92 --> 2846.76
single detail of it like put it down in

2843.339 --> 2848.68
historical context even to that detail

2846.76 --> 2851.8
and

2848.68 --> 2854.7999999999997
the Earth is not a ball

2851.8 --> 2856.54
and most Ballers literally don't know

2854.8 --> 2859.0
what the [ __ ] is coming out of their

2856.54 --> 2861.099
mouth when they're claiming to have

2859.0 --> 2863.02
evidence that the Earth is a ball they

2861.099 --> 2864.099
literally do not understand what they're

2863.02 --> 2866.2
talking about

2864.099 --> 2868.78
they don't understand reasoning they

2866.2 --> 2870.0989999999997
don't understand basic logic and

2868.78 --> 2871.599
academics

2870.099 --> 2873.46
they don't understand what the

2871.599 --> 2877.079
scientific method is

2873.46 --> 2881.68
and they don't realize that everything

2877.079 --> 2884.8
every aspect of the globe religion the

2881.68 --> 2889.54
conviction that the Earth is a ball

2884.8 --> 2891.88
is all based all of it no exception like

2889.54 --> 2893.92
not even mathematically an exception

2891.88 --> 2895.599
that's actually where it's specifically

2893.92 --> 2899.26
there every time

2895.599 --> 2902.319
and that is that the Earth is not proven

2899.26 --> 2904.6600000000003
to be a ball it is assumed

2902.319 --> 2908.2599999999998
to be a ball

2904.66 --> 2912.16
and then math is Unleashed upon that

2908.26 --> 2915.28
Assumption of it to reinforce that it is

2912.16 --> 2916.96
true that the assumption that isn't

2915.28 --> 2919.3190000000004
actually proven yeah it's called a

2916.96 --> 2921.88
presupposition

2919.319 --> 2925.44
pre-supposition that the Earth is a

2921.88 --> 2930.28
sphere is at the heart of every

2925.44 --> 2935.26
conceivable Globe Earth are given no

2930.28 --> 2938.5600000000004
exception not a single exception exists

2935.26 --> 2941.26
within the Realms of recorded and

2938.56 --> 2946.9
unrecorded information

2941.26 --> 2949.44
yeah no exception exists to this not a

2946.9 --> 2949.44
single one

2952.53 --> 2963.3390000000004
[Music]

2959.8 --> 2968.2000000000003
also you kind of need the Flat Earth

2963.339 --> 2969.88
in order to make a glow-birth model

2968.2 --> 2972.0989999999997
that also

2969.88 --> 2974.7400000000002
because yeah

2972.099 --> 2977.319
it's the only way to do it

2974.74 --> 2979.839
you can't navigate on the globe using

2977.319 --> 2981.7
the systems that are being used and the

2979.839 --> 2982.839
tools that have been used for a thousand

2981.7 --> 2984.339
years

2982.839 --> 2987.46
yeah

2984.339 --> 2989.4
they only work on a flat Earth

2987.46 --> 2992.319
they don't work on a ball they couldn't

2989.4 --> 2995.92
work on a ball

2992.319 --> 2999.099
that's impossible can't use a Sextant on

2995.92 --> 3002.099
a ball it's physically impossible to use

2999.099 --> 3004.76
the tool as instructed

3002.099 --> 3004.76
foreign

3007.56 --> 3013.56
Where's the border we don't know

3010.319 --> 3016.74
there might be a loop connecting one

3013.56 --> 3020.46
side to the other in a continuum

3016.74 --> 3022.74
we do not know the full true nature of

3020.46 --> 3025.319
the content of the realm

3022.74 --> 3028.3799999999997
but we do know about the geometric

3025.319 --> 3030.72
aspect of its surface and that is that

3028.38 --> 3033.9
it's flat and that it has to be

3030.72 --> 3037.74
contained because we have gas pressure

3033.9 --> 3039.319
so it has to be an enclosed realm and it

3037.74 --> 3042.18
could be

3039.319 --> 3044.22
after all this time it could be a snow

3042.18 --> 3047.5789999999997
globe after all I highly doubt it though

3044.22 --> 3049.339
I think it is a looping continuum

3047.579 --> 3053.6400000000003
like a box

3049.339 --> 3057.0589999999997
rectangular box that literally connects

3053.64 --> 3061.339
one side to the other literally in a

3057.059 --> 3061.3390000000004
Continuum endless straight line

3061.619 --> 3067.319
within a limited space that could be it

3065.22 --> 3069.24
that doesn't make sense to you yeah yeah

3067.319 --> 3071.099
because you're still all filled up with

3069.24 --> 3074.04
globe nonsense so you don't even have

3071.099 --> 3076.8590000000004
the freedom in your mind to try to

3074.04 --> 3081.48
imagine what I'm talking about

3076.859 --> 3083.819
and yeah that's your problem not mine

3081.48 --> 3086.3
yeah I'm not here to convince you I'm

3083.819 --> 3089.339
just here to demonstrate to everybody

3086.3 --> 3092.46
and hopefully including to you

3089.339 --> 3095.7
why your arguments are highly outdated

3092.46 --> 3099.2400000000002
and why the Earth is in the globe

3095.7 --> 3101.7599999999998
even though you might believe it is

3099.24 --> 3104.52
right and there are solutions for what

3101.76 --> 3108.3
the realm actually is move beyond flat

3104.52 --> 3111.48
Earth it is speculation about the nature

3108.3 --> 3114.9
of the entire place we're in beyond our

3111.48 --> 3116.52
reach beyond my current reach right so

3114.9 --> 3118.92
it's not technically even involved in

3116.52 --> 3121.2
Flat Earth it's just my conception but

3118.92 --> 3123.48
that the Earth is flat that the place

3121.2 --> 3125.7
we're standing in

3123.48 --> 3128.46
the surface of it that it is

3125.7 --> 3132.859
geometrically orientated perfectly as

3128.46 --> 3135.3
flat is an absolute fact demonstrable

3132.859 --> 3138.7799999999997
unavoidable fact

3135.3 --> 3141.3590000000004
and referenced in many technical manuals

3138.78 --> 3145.3390000000004
that involve flight

3141.359 --> 3147.96
land measuring radar everything

3145.339 --> 3149.7
everything proves the Earth is flat

3147.96 --> 3151.38
every single thing

3149.7 --> 3153.5589999999997
yeah

3151.38 --> 3157.1400000000003
and they put in quite a lot of effort

3153.559 --> 3159.6600000000003
culturally to give you false misleading

3157.14 --> 3162.42
ideas suggesting that the Earth is a

3159.66 --> 3164.04
globe despite everything because that's

3162.42 --> 3165.66
what you want right

3164.04 --> 3168.72
you want to think it's a glow because

3165.66 --> 3171.24
Dan's imagination about outer space and

3168.72 --> 3172.3799999999997
all that can be real That's so exciting

3171.24 --> 3174.839
isn't it

3172.38 --> 3177.54
that we are supposedly going to ascend

3174.839 --> 3179.5789999999997
Beyond this Petty planet and move to the

3177.54 --> 3183.119
Stars yeah yeah it's really cute dream

3179.579 --> 3185.6400000000003
very distracting from your personal life

3183.119 --> 3189.059
and actually trying to do the best you

3185.64 --> 3191.7599999999998
can in the world that you and the rest

3189.059 --> 3194.6400000000003
of the future of mankind is destined to

3191.76 --> 3197.8190000000004
be at exclusively because we're not

3194.64 --> 3201.0589999999997
gonna leave this realm is the place that

3197.819 --> 3202.5589999999997
humans shall live in until the end of

3201.059 --> 3206.0
times

3202.559 --> 3206.0
or in the end of humanity

3206.7 --> 3212.0989999999997
and we're not going anywhere so you

3208.74 --> 3215.4599999999996
better damn well take care of this place

3212.099 --> 3218.3300000000004
starting with your direct environment

3215.46 --> 3222.9
and your mental health

3218.33 --> 3226.94
[Music]

3222.9 --> 3226.94
is a plainest shape nope

3227.099 --> 3232.8
a shape is already a presupposition

3230.579 --> 3234.96
you say what is the shape of the earth

3232.8 --> 3236.52
you automatically assume that it then is

3234.96 --> 3240.42
a shape

3236.52 --> 3242.339
that it is a it is effectively a globe

3240.42 --> 3245.2200000000003
but the middle but what is it a cube

3242.339 --> 3248.04
yeah because it's automatically assumed

3245.22 --> 3252.319
to be a shape with the center yeah

3248.04 --> 3252.319
because all shapes have a center

3255.18 --> 3261.2999999999997
it's invocation of geometry

3258.24 --> 3263.819
right if you just keep it to hey what is

3261.3 --> 3265.5
the orientation of the surface

3263.819 --> 3268.2599999999998
geometrically

3265.5 --> 3272.52
well then you can say flat because flat

3268.26 --> 3274.099
is an aspect it's a geometric aspect

3272.52 --> 3276.96
foreign

3274.099 --> 3280.44
because the shape is already a

3276.96 --> 3284.2400000000002
presupposition that it has a center that

3280.44 --> 3284.2400000000002
is basically spherical

3284.28 --> 3291.4900000000002
or irregularly spherical that is what

3287.339 --> 3298.14
the shape invocation suggests

3291.49 --> 3300.66
[Music]

3298.14 --> 3303.0
have you ever seen the movie The Cube

3300.66 --> 3304.68
Maybe

3303.0 --> 3308.78
I don't remember

3304.68 --> 3308.7799999999997
woodworking gummy bear good to see you

3310.44 --> 3314.86
the email is 13 years old

3312.9 --> 3319.909
okay

3314.86 --> 3319.909
[Music]

3321.18 --> 3324.74
hello sleep with one eye open

3333.2 --> 3339.68
but yeah turret you might have a point

3335.579 --> 3339.6800000000003
he does sound like a very young person

3340.24 --> 3343.43
[Music]

3343.619 --> 3346.619
foreign

3347.66 --> 3352.7999999999997
they're allowed in here too if they know

3350.28 --> 3355.09
how to behave and he does seem to know

3352.8 --> 3358.2090000000003
how to behave

3355.09 --> 3358.2090000000003
[Music]

3367.559 --> 3372.1800000000003
I believe it's Chen now

3370.619 --> 3375.38
uh

3372.18 --> 3375.3799999999997
it's his name

3383.46 --> 3387.859
I think he knows how to say his name

3397.619 --> 3401.359
I'm sorry of course

3403.7 --> 3407.0
dude oh

3409.26 --> 3412.619
green lighted that

3411.41 --> 3416.0899999999997
[Music]

3412.619 --> 3419.329
I mean it's obviously a troll comment

3416.09 --> 3419.329
[Music]

3428.359 --> 3434.64
all right so yeah Nemo you've gotten

3432.599 --> 3436.6800000000003
you've gotten quite an extensive

3434.64 --> 3438.54
rebuttal here you have anything to say

3436.68 --> 3440.3999999999996
for yourself you're gonna just leave and

3438.54 --> 3443.9
forget all about what I said

3440.4 --> 3443.9
and believe it's a globe again

3444.54 --> 3450.359
or you're gonna actually let sink what

3448.38 --> 3452.579
we shared with you specifically me

3450.359 --> 3454.7
because I've been addressing a lot of

3452.579 --> 3454.7000000000003
you

3455.339 --> 3461.88
no no you can't nobody swears in here

3459.059 --> 3463.2000000000003
in my chat

3461.88 --> 3465.1800000000003
or

3463.2 --> 3467.7
keep it at a minimum you're gonna have

3465.18 --> 3469.7999999999997
to have a very good reason to do it

3467.7 --> 3471.24
because if you're just gonna swear like

3469.8 --> 3474.78
an idiot

3471.24 --> 3477.4199999999996
like that zetetic [ __ ] Martin had on

3474.78 --> 3479.28
yesterday I'm gonna kick you out

3477.42 --> 3483.92
promise you

3479.28 --> 3483.92
don't care how young or old you are

3490.76 --> 3499.0
[Music]

3503.339 --> 3507.7799999999997
yeah

3505.26 --> 3511.0200000000004
where did you assume I'm 13 yeah when

3507.78 --> 3513.2400000000002
you bro when you lit 12.

3511.02 --> 3515.48
hilarious you literally brought up

3513.24 --> 3515.4799999999996
Pokemon

3515.88 --> 3518.6600000000003
so

3519.36 --> 3526.2000000000003
[Music]

3523.099 --> 3530.7200000000003
that usually means either you're gay and

3526.2 --> 3530.72
in your 30s or you're like 12.

3545.819 --> 3553.38
yeah Nemo don't don't mind turret I mean

3550.44 --> 3558.14
he's usually the youngest in here but

3553.38 --> 3561.799
now of course you are so he has to now

3558.14 --> 3563.96
be like oh yes yes child

3561.799 --> 3567.299
you'll grow up too

3563.96 --> 3569.6
sorry I totally get it that's what I did

3567.299 --> 3576.6
when I was younger all the time so

3569.6 --> 3576.6
[Music]

3597.02 --> 3602.4
oh wait yeah I think it's an older movie

3600.72 --> 3603.18
right woodworking gummy bear I've seen

3602.4 --> 3605.94
that

3603.18 --> 3609.1189999999997
it was a terrible movie though I mean it

3605.94 --> 3612.2400000000002
was basically a psychological horror

3609.119 --> 3614.94
it was [ __ ] up

3612.24 --> 3617.819
but yeah I remember

3614.94 --> 3621.44
that I've seen that like

3617.819 --> 3621.44
15 years ago or something

3624.54 --> 3630.72
but yeah I usually don't bring up just

3627.78 --> 3633.299
like really disgusting horror

3630.72 --> 3634.799
and [ __ ] even if it's good I'm just like

3633.299 --> 3636.25
no no thanks

3634.799 --> 3637.44
it's because

3636.25 --> 3640.319
[Music]

3637.44 --> 3642.42
I mean if you're really into that you'll

3640.319 --> 3644.819
probably already know the good ones and

3642.42 --> 3645.839
I don't want to like make people try

3644.819 --> 3648.72
that out

3645.839 --> 3651.5589999999997
I just like good stuff stuff that you'll

3648.72 --> 3651.5589999999997
get something out of

3651.74 --> 3665.14
[Music]

3666.299 --> 3671.52
all right

3668.16 --> 3673.6189999999997
okay skeptic and turret seem to be

3671.52 --> 3675.119
having like this inner joke but I don't

3673.619 --> 3678.1400000000003
get it either Nemo I don't understand

3675.119 --> 3678.1400000000003
what they're talking about

3678.9 --> 3683.54
this might be some weird movie reference

3681.059 --> 3683.5400000000004
or something

3700.2 --> 3703.8799999999997
I don't understand either

3715.68 --> 3721.14
good yeah

3717.9 --> 3723.1800000000003
yeah look Nemo uh I know you're 12 and

3721.14 --> 3725.819
all but like a lot of these guys in the

3723.18 --> 3729.24
chat here are actually kind of Boomers

3725.819 --> 3732.0589999999997
in their 50s and 60s

3729.24 --> 3736.0789999999997
so there's gonna be like internal jokes

3732.059 --> 3737.6400000000003
about yeah old stuff

3736.079 --> 3740.099
mm-hmm

3737.64 --> 3743.22
there's also by the way plenty of people

3740.099 --> 3746.0
my age 42 I mean I think Michael Khan is

53 years young I know I know

3768.119 --> 3773.2200000000003
I was just explaining to the well the 12

3770.579 --> 3774.96

3782.339 --> 3784.7599999999998
all right

3790.559 --> 3796.8590000000004
it's just that when there's like people

3793.4 --> 3798.599
around the older ages they tend to like

3796.859 --> 3801.5989999999997
make

3798.599 --> 3803.7000000000003
jokes that reference to movies and all

3801.599 --> 3805.5
that that are way before your before

3803.7 --> 3808.04
your time

3805.5 --> 3808.04
so

3813.079 --> 3817.5
dude I'm 42 and I didn't even get it at

3816.18 --> 3820.7599999999998
that point

3817.5 --> 3820.76
so anyway

3835.339 --> 3840.839
okay woodworking gummy bear didn't know

3838.5 --> 3842.88
you got all that out of it

3840.839 --> 3845.66
but I I really don't want to talk about

3842.88 --> 3845.6600000000003
it if you don't mind

3849.03 --> 3852.599
[Music]

3866.4 --> 3873.54
I think we'll go ahead with the debate

3871.38 --> 3876.48
but he gets paid what

3873.54 --> 3879.839
what are you talking about

3876.48 --> 3882.799
like ask PTC net but what are you

3879.839 --> 3882.799
talking about turret

3926.119 --> 3931.799
challenged to debate for five

3929.76 --> 3933.9
oh so it's going to be one of those

3931.799 --> 3936.72
[ __ ]

3933.9 --> 3939.599
things where you're basically not gonna

3936.72 --> 3943.22
get the money wow well if Richard did

3939.599 --> 3943.2200000000003
that he would be pretty [ __ ]

3949.68 --> 3957.4199999999996
unless he just like is doing it just for

3953.7 --> 3959.52
the debate not expecting to be paid

3957.42 --> 3962.4
because if he literally did it for the

3959.52 --> 3963.599
money he is gonna have a very very bad

3962.4 --> 3965.54
time

3963.599 --> 3970.619
because he's never gonna get it ever

3965.54 --> 3972.7799999999997
Ballers never pay out ever

3970.619 --> 3974.04
I mean they'll rather just give you

3972.78 --> 3977.76
money

3974.04 --> 3980.96
then actually pay out for a bet

3977.76 --> 3980.96
I'm not even joking

3982.799 --> 3987.74
why is the thumbnail on Earth Map like

3985.26 --> 3987.7400000000002
it isn't

3987.78 --> 3991.1600000000003
it's not flying in space

3991.98 --> 3997.799
it's literally A View from outside of

3994.92 --> 4000.44
physical available space

3997.799 --> 4002.839
yeah because there is a limitation after

4000.44 --> 4005.66
which there is literally nothing

4002.839 --> 4008.66
yeah outside of the realm

4005.66 --> 4011.839
there is literally nothing not more room

4008.66 --> 4015.3799999999997
there's literally nothing

4011.839 --> 4018.0789999999997
not avoid not a vacuum

4015.38 --> 4020.96
no it's non-space there's nothing there

4018.079 --> 4022.6400000000003
there's no room to be

4020.96 --> 4026.2400000000002
but that doesn't mean that you couldn't

4022.64 --> 4028.94
have a virtual camera

4026.24 --> 4031.2799999999997
showing you from the outside roughly

4028.94 --> 4033.38
what you think it looks like and that is

4031.28 --> 4036.559
what the thumbnail is

4033.38 --> 4039.7000000000003
it's not in space nothing is in space

4036.559 --> 4039.7000000000003

4049.039 --> 4053.3590000000004
well I don't really debate I don't know

4051.5 --> 4056.059
if you noticed Amy traveler I just don't

4053.359 --> 4057.98
really debate it's literally a waste of

the camera just freeze

I don't know

4063.92 --> 4070.52
but

4066.14 --> 4074.299
I guess I could do it for like 500 euros

4070.52 --> 4076.46
but I'm just not really interested

4074.299 --> 4080.0
because I know what they're gonna do

4076.46 --> 4083.96
it's just gonna be them whining and

4080.0 --> 4086.0
whining making me sick giving me a

headache not giving me the room to

4086.0 --> 4090.68
answer anything

4087.92 --> 4092.66
until I lose my concentration and I'm

4090.68 --> 4093.98
lost and then they'll let me give me all

4092.66 --> 4096.139999999999
the room in the world because I no

4093.98 --> 4097.759
longer really want to be there and don't

4096.14 --> 4099.56
have the concentration left to even

4097.759 --> 4103.819
focus on whatever the [ __ ] I was there

4099.56 --> 4106.339000000001

4103.819 --> 4109.2390000000005

there's no way

4135.98 --> 4143.718999999999

4138.739 --> 4145.94
I mean for 500 euros I'll give them like

4143.719 --> 4147.9800000000005
an hour

4145.94 --> 4149.54

[ __ ] they want if they want to pull

4149.54 --> 4153.319

room for an amazing dream of theirs

4157.819 --> 4161.96
yeah

4159.08 --> 4164.179
but that's not a debate I'm just there

4161.96 --> 4166.279
for my time

4164.179 --> 4168.08
because I'm not expecting to actually

4166.279 --> 4171.679
debate it's literally a waste of time

4168.08 --> 4174.219
these people don't have arguments

4171.679 --> 4178.64
they won't even address the most

4174.219 --> 4181.279
rudimentary errors starting out with

4178.64 --> 4184.759
everything they say is presupposition

4181.279 --> 4186.9800000000005
based so it's just like it's there's no

4184.759 --> 4189.199
point

4186.98 --> 4191.959999999999
in actually assuming that you're gonna

4189.199 --> 4194.139999999999
debate so I'm just gonna be paid for my

4191.96 --> 4194.14
time

4196.16 --> 4204.099999999999
right and of course nobody's gonna pay a

4199.58 --> 4204.1
hundred thousand but they might do 500

4207.14 --> 4214.64
and I will literally be selling out

wasting my time to a bunch of [ __ ]

people are going to see it and probably

4224.0 --> 4229.159
the same shit's gonna happen last time I

4226.58 --> 4233.239
did it for free with Mr sensible that

4229.159 --> 4236.0
just rudimentary questions and then

literally expect and that's why I'm not

4244.64 --> 4249.320000000001
gonna assume it's gonna be a debate it's

yeah also yeah no probably not say that

4463.4 --> 4468.62
but

4465.56 --> 4471.7390000000005
yeah when you're a little kid when I was

4468.62 --> 4473.9
12 I wanted to be like no I'm an adult I

4471.739 --> 4475.879999999999
will take like the most hardcore [ __ ]

4473.9 --> 4478.759999999999
you can imagine I want it right now

4475.88 --> 4481.52
because I I refuse

4478.76 --> 4483.92
to accept that I'm 12 years old that's

4481.52 --> 4486.02
that was my issue when I was young so I

4483.92 --> 4488.9
would be saying well no no it's like oh

4486.02 --> 4491.6
no no I'm not afraid of porn

4488.9 --> 4493.82
serious it's not even a joke

4491.6 --> 4496.6990000000005
but that doesn't mean that you actually

4493.82 --> 4500.0
know what's good for you

4496.699 --> 4501.739
you rather don't

4500.0 --> 4503.719
because you don't understand the

4501.739 --> 4506.54
corrupting influences yet

4503.719 --> 4508.88
and this world has become quite deranged

4506.54 --> 4510.32
with all the corrupting influences and

4508.88 --> 4512.12
so little kids are going to be like oh

4510.32 --> 4515.36
but I can handle that

4512.12 --> 4518.12
everybody's seeing that up like I'm up

4515.36 --> 4520.099999999999
to date with the modern world yeah well

4518.12 --> 4523.88
that means you're you've been subjected

4520.1 --> 4526.58
to really terrible corruption then

4523.88 --> 4530.2390000000005

4526.58 --> 4531.66
that or hearing about it at all at that

4540.159 --> 4545.839999999999

4542.78 --> 4548.3
when I was a kid I was it yeah I would

4545.84 --> 4550.52
like naughty magazines even at a very

4548.3 --> 4552.14
young age especially at a young like

4550.52 --> 4554.360000000001
when I was older I was not interested in

4552.14 --> 4557.96
that at all when it was a kid it's like

4554.36 --> 4560.299999999999
yeah but I want to be that now

4557.96 --> 4561.02
you just you don't know what's good for

4560.3 --> 4563.3
you

4561.02 --> 4566.06
at that age you really don't because

4563.3 --> 4567.14
you're like too much trying to become an

4566.06 --> 4569.620000000001
adult

4567.14 --> 4573.02
it's just what happens you know at 12

4569.62 --> 4576.38
hormones start to like

4573.02 --> 4578.360000000001
kick in and give you basically a early

4576.38 --> 4580.34
version of the format of what you're

4578.36 --> 4582.98
going to be later and you just want all

4580.34 --> 4585.89
that immediately

4582.98 --> 4588.32

4585.89 --> 4590.42
[Music]

4588.32 --> 4591.5599999999995
for you I think well it all depends on

4590.42 --> 4593.4800000000005
the school

4591.56 --> 4595.46
if you're surrounded by mentally

4593.48 --> 4599.199
deranged teachers

4595.46 --> 4599.199
then it's not good for you at all

4603.62 --> 4608.5599999999995
I mean a school

4605.84 --> 4612.1990000000005
without good teachers is completely

4608.56 --> 4614.6
pointless and actually detrimental

4612.199 --> 4617.0
so you need a good teacher that's the

4614.6 --> 4618.7390000000005
thing you actually really need

4617.0 --> 4621.62
good teachers

4618.739 --> 4624.08
teachers that like have this insight and

4621.62 --> 4626.659
oversight over how kids think what

4624.08 --> 4630.219
they'll become and take it serious and

4626.659 --> 4630.219
be traditionalist

4630.32 --> 4635.259999999999

4650.38 --> 4654.8

4720.02 --> 4725.06
hang in the background and then they'll

4722.36 --> 4726.98
start going at it probably but in

4725.06 --> 4730.1
general I don't really like raunchy

4726.98 --> 4731.718999999999
jokes like at all in my chat like I

4730.1 --> 4733.6990000000005
literally

4731.719 --> 4735.7390000000005
don't want them

4733.699 --> 4738.98
you want to hear that [ __ ] and go to oh

4735.739 --> 4741.32
and Benjamin I mean

4738.98 --> 4744.44
he has a much higher tolerance for that

4741.32 --> 4746.599999999999
sort of crap he lets his bears like talk

4744.44 --> 4750.919999999999
raunchy all the time

4746.6 --> 4755.860000000001
I do not I I really don't like it I mean

4750.92 --> 4755.86
I really don't I just don't want it

4755.9 --> 4761.78
and then if a young person is there then

4758.6 --> 4764.4800000000005
I'll be like very strict about it

4761.78 --> 4766.4
but I just it's not like oh yeah raunchy

4764.48 --> 4769.28
and then also 12 year old oh now we have

4766.4 --> 4772.5199999999995
to pretend like being good no no a young

4769.28 --> 4775.159
person in the presence is an excuse for

4772.52 --> 4778.1
me to get hard on it because I really

4775.159 --> 4780.44
don't like people doing that can be

4778.1 --> 4781.46
helped out cannot be stopped it just

4780.44 --> 4785.178999999999
happens

4781.46 --> 4787.88
yeah because once raunchy sets in and is

4785.179 --> 4790.04
normalized in the person it never goes

4787.88 --> 4792.1990000000005
away

4790.04 --> 4795.0199999999995
and I [ __ ] hate it I consider it as a

4792.199 --> 4799.0
gay it's it's gay being raunchy is

4795.02 --> 4799.0
actually gay just so you know

4800.6 --> 4802.96

4839.12 --> 4847.159
your curiosity take you into bad places

4843.02 --> 4848.719
if you feel like this is bad then listen

4847.159 --> 4850.659
to that

4848.719 --> 4855.26
don't be like

4850.659 --> 4857.659
I'm bored no no if it's bad that

4855.26 --> 4860.42
actually means it's bad if you feel that

4857.659 --> 4864.62
pulse it's right if you then ignore that

4860.42 --> 4867.82
pulse you're gonna grow into something

4864.62 --> 4867.82
that's not good

4871.88 --> 4878.5
Beer's bad could be it is at that age

4875.96 --> 4878.5
definitely

4879.98 --> 4885.199
especially if you start drinking to

4882.92 --> 4888.6990000000005
escape because you're miserable about

4885.199 --> 4888.699
something that's the worst

4900.14 --> 4905.780000000001
yeah Marine Corps that you're yeah I

4902.179 --> 4907.88
know but that's because I ah Marine

4905.78 --> 4911.0199999999995
Corps is kind of gay

4907.88 --> 4911.02
I said it

4913.699 --> 4920.5599999999995
not saying they're not competent

4916.94 --> 4920.5599999999995
but uh yeah

4932.179 --> 4937.84
don't consider myself didn't tell you oh

4934.34 --> 4937.84
that well that's very wise of you

4949.4 --> 4953.719
then by the way sorry woodworking gummy

4951.679 --> 4955.219
bear I feel pissed off at me but I do

4953.719 --> 4957.62
it's just

4955.219 --> 4960.56
doesn't matter

4957.62 --> 4963.5599999999995
raunchy is gay

4960.56 --> 4967.04
so yeah there's a tradition of

4963.56 --> 4970.179
raunchiness well that means it's gay

4967.04 --> 4970.179
that's my opinion

4975.8 --> 4980.2390000000005
why is Marine Corps gay well it's

4978.199 --> 4983.5599999999995
because apparently they make jokes about

4980.239 --> 4983.5599999999995
gay bars all the time

4990.199 --> 4995.659
but yeah

4992.719 --> 4998.2390000000005
it's just the yeah that's how I I am

4995.659 --> 5001.0

5094.0 --> 5098.46
it's funny I just think it's gross

5101.02 --> 5107.92
and gay it I mean it lit I I don't call

5104.08 --> 5111.36
it gay without reason you know because I

5107.92 --> 5113.9800000000005
have clinical homophobia so whatever

5111.36 --> 5116.259999999999
whatever that's supposed to be but I bet

5113.98 --> 5119.5
I could actually prove that I'm clinical

5116.26 --> 5121.3
because I have a physical visceral

5119.5 --> 5124.6
response

5121.3 --> 5127.84
to people acting gay physical visceral

5124.6 --> 5130.900000000001
response I literally get sick literally

5127.84 --> 5133.54
like my organs are it literally happens

5130.9 --> 5136.48
it's not a joke it's not an exaggeration

5133.54 --> 5139.96
and when people get all raunchy guess

5136.48 --> 5142.28
what I get the same response

5139.96 --> 5146.999
that's why I think it's gay

that's a very interesting thing

about what my sick response or the

5216.1 --> 5221.320000000001
raunchy talk

5217.42 --> 5223.12
because yeah no [ __ ] did that I get

5221.32 --> 5225.34
literally physically ill and that that

5223.12 --> 5226.96
prevents me from turning gay yeah yeah

5225.34 --> 5230.139
it did

5226.96 --> 5232.179
I'm glad off it because there's actually

5230.139 --> 5235.6
a great great chance that if I didn't

5232.179 --> 5240.28
have it that I would have become gay and

5235.6 --> 5243.280000000001
I dread a like really hellish dread the

5240.28 --> 5245.0199999999995
notion that that would have happened

5243.28 --> 5249.5199999999995
oh my God

5245.02 --> 5251.38
I don't want to even imagine that I

5249.52 --> 5253.120000000001
literally do not want to imagine that

that would have happened

5264.219 --> 5267.12
last gay joke

5267.34 --> 5271.42
oh it was a joke oh okay

5269.92 --> 5275.219
okay

5271.42 --> 5275.219
I didn't see the joke there but

5280.659 --> 5286.48
right but yeah I mean it brings me back

5283.6 --> 5290.4400000000005
again to times when I don't really like

5286.48 --> 5293.199
the reference but yeah but I mean

5290.44 --> 5296.919999999999
for a time I actually sort of thought I

5293.199 --> 5298.48
was gay but it wasn't homosexual

5296.92 --> 5300.46
because I didn't understand what the

5298.48 --> 5302.199
hell gay was even supposed to be in like

5300.46 --> 5304.78
some people say oh it's all about sex

5302.199 --> 5308.799999999999
and and others is like but no it isn't

5304.78 --> 5310.3
really it's like this different way of

5308.8 --> 5313.0
attitude and

5310.3 --> 5315.34
and so sort of

5313.0 --> 5317.92
I kind of thought I was gay

5315.34 --> 5319.6
but definitely not sexual

5317.92 --> 5322.3
you see

5319.6 --> 5325.2390000000005
not I like women I fell in love with

5322.3 --> 5328.12
women I don't like guys

5325.239 --> 5331.419999999999
but still sort of thought that I could

5328.12 --> 5334.42
still be sort of gay and because I was

5331.42 --> 5336.1
just like a little flamboyant but not in

5334.42 --> 5338.38
it like not in a gay way it's

5336.1 --> 5340.84
complicated I just I wanted to be

5338.38 --> 5343.6
special boy and when you begin with that

5340.84 --> 5345.6990000000005
again I'm especially when I'm gonna do

5343.6 --> 5348.58
it totally different I was a [ __ ]

5345.699 --> 5350.32
[ __ ] okay I was just a stupid special

5348.58 --> 5352.84
boy idiot

5350.32 --> 5354.639
that thought he could be the exception

5352.84 --> 5356.8
to something that he didn't [ __ ]

5354.639 --> 5360.46
understand and I'm so embarrassed that

5356.8 --> 5363.04
it all happened right and yeah I Kissed

5360.46 --> 5365.62
A guy once and then I literally almost

5363.04 --> 5369.06
threw up and after that point I knew I

5365.62 --> 5369.0599999999995
made a big mistake

5369.1 --> 5374.4400000000005
and I'm gonna abandon this idea forever

5377.98 --> 5382.259999999999
right so that's enough about that

5385.36 --> 5389.32
all right and none of that [ __ ] would

5387.52 --> 5391.84
have happened by the way

5389.32 --> 5394.84
and it hadn't been kind of goaded pushed

5391.84 --> 5397.719
into it yeah because there were I was

5394.84 --> 5402.159000000001
surrounded by liberals

5397.719 --> 5402.159
that were like pro-gay

5402.34 --> 5409.179
and I felt like I was literally being

5406.48 --> 5411.82
peer pressured into that crap

5409.179 --> 5414.159
and they were like really offended when

5411.82 --> 5415.659
I eventually said like no I'm not

5414.159 --> 5419.199
[ __ ] gay

5415.659 --> 5421.78
stop whining about that I don't like it

5419.199 --> 5424.86
I think it's gross they got actually

5421.78 --> 5424.86
really offended

5426.76 --> 5430.84
why are you kissing man because I wanted

5429.219 --> 5434.27
to know

5430.84 --> 5435.82
because I wanted to know if I was gay

and yeah

5443.92 --> 5448.2390000000005
well blatantly I was drunk I was at a

5447.34 --> 5453.2390000000005
party

5448.239 --> 5453.239
Gothic party and it was like yeah well

5453.76 --> 5458.08
by the way with these friends that

5456.28 --> 5460.0599999999995
worked right I think these guys were

5458.08 --> 5462.699
literally I mean

5460.06 --> 5465.280000000001
I think that these friends from back

5462.699 --> 5467.0199999999995
then were literally trying to break my

5465.28 --> 5469.3
soul

5467.02 --> 5472.0
I think there's actually that I I

5469.3 --> 5475.179
basically escaped a really big very

5472.0 --> 5478.239
serious satanic trap to destroy my soul

5475.179 --> 5481.06
I think I literally escaped that and I'm

5478.239 --> 5483.699
talking about 20 years ago

5481.06 --> 5485.679
and it's not an exaggeration I'm not

5483.699 --> 5488.32
seeing these people again and they were

5485.679 --> 5491.26
all pretty [ __ ] up in the mind

5488.32 --> 5495.42
in very specific ways which I would

5491.26 --> 5495.42
definitely associate with satanism

5500.08 --> 5504.699
that's how they talk kids into yeah well

5502.0 --> 5505.6
that basically happened with me in my

5504.699 --> 5509.199
teens

5505.6 --> 5512.7390000000005
not pre-teens thank God

5548.98 --> 5554.44
better than everybody else

5551.44 --> 5557.739
not understanding that there was

basically a system for that that would

5557.739 --> 5564.5199999999995
isolate and destroy you and turn you

5599.62 --> 5603.76
I'm not

5601.42 --> 5605.4400000000005
they're zombies

5603.76 --> 5608.76
they're zombies

5605.44 --> 5608.759999999999
driven by power

5609.1 --> 5615.88
and I almost rolled into that but guess

5612.219 --> 5617.26
what at this the spirit this Spirit

5615.88 --> 5619.12
defense

5617.26 --> 5622.54
that made me sick

5619.12 --> 5625.42
literally made me sick

5622.54 --> 5627.76
and that basically I listened to it I

5625.42 --> 5630.88
didn't break it I might have been dead

5627.76 --> 5633.9400000000005
if I did I felt like if I'm gonna defile

5630.88 --> 5635.6990000000005
this this Spirit that's warning me I'm

5633.94 --> 5638.678999999999
gonna die

5635.699 --> 5641.138999999999
horribly in a nightmare potentially

5638.679 --> 5643.6
literally going to hell in my last

5641.139 --> 5646.84
moments yeah that's what that feels like

5643.6 --> 5648.88
and I'm taking it very serious and it

5646.84 --> 5651.360000000001
prevented me from basically going down

5648.88 --> 5651.36
that path

5653.56 --> 5656.56
foreign

5658.92 --> 5664.84
no it's not good at all that's called

5661.84 --> 5668.32
Eugenics you know what it does

5664.84 --> 5671.860000000001
it creates the worst circumstances

5668.32 --> 5674.86
possible you get Sodom and Gomorrah

5671.86 --> 5676.54
scenarios out of that Nemo

5674.86 --> 5679.54
you know what happens

5676.54 --> 5682.6
everything gets destroyed nature gets

5679.54 --> 5685.06
wrecked polluted people start acting

5682.6 --> 5687.88
like freaking barbarians and just

5685.06 --> 5691.02
destroying everything

5687.88 --> 5691.02
not good

5691.06 --> 5697.6
yeah gayness yeah oh I'm gonna trigger

5694.42 --> 5701.52
some people is a curse it's literally a

5697.6 --> 5704.8
curse if you allow it

5701.52 --> 5707.320000000001
everything around you is going to turn

5704.8 --> 5710.92
into Sodom and Gomorrah

5707.32 --> 5716.62
every single time no exception in

5710.92 --> 5718.12
history it always happens it always does

5716.62 --> 5721.0599999999995
[Music]

5718.12 --> 5723.159
and we don't need the lowering of human

5721.06 --> 5726.1
population there's already going to be a

5723.159 --> 5728.5
giant feedback loop dude do you know

5726.1 --> 5731.08
that we potentially through everything

5728.5 --> 5735.88
that's happened recently that we are

5731.08 --> 5738.46
facing a potential Extinction event okay

5735.88 --> 5741.159000000001
because of this you know how much of the

5738.46 --> 5743.02
genetic pool has been damaged in the

5741.159 --> 5745.799999999999
last three years

5743.02 --> 5745.8
the two years

5746.139 --> 5756.400000000001
we literally may not survive this

5751.719 --> 5758.92
because in 20 years guess what

5756.4 --> 5761.5599999999995
what's going to replace the old

5758.92 --> 5764.679
nobody yeah that's right and then

5761.56 --> 5768.360000000001
everybody's just gonna grow old and die

5764.679 --> 5771.659
and then nothing is left but dead cities

5768.36 --> 5771.659
and junk

5772.42 --> 5776.139
yeah

5773.56 --> 5780.54
and then shit's gonna bewilder

5776.139 --> 5780.54
and then it's all God it's all gone

5783.52 --> 5787.4800000000005
so gay is bad yeah that's damn right it

5786.219 --> 5790.139
is

5787.48 --> 5790.138999999999
foreign

5792.13 --> 5800.56
[Music]

5798.659 --> 5805.659
you can't

5800.56 --> 5807.280000000001
lower population by allowing gayness

5805.659 --> 5810.159
if you do that

5807.28 --> 5812.5599999999995
the whole place will transform all the

5810.159 --> 5816.46
cultural roots and value and

5812.56 --> 5818.56
productivity will all go away oh you

5816.46 --> 5821.62
have a lower population of useless

5818.56 --> 5823.06
[ __ ] deranged idiots that's what

5821.62 --> 5825.699
you'll have then

5823.06 --> 5827.5
yeah is that is that why you need to

5825.699 --> 5830.259999999999
lower the population to turn everybody

5827.5 --> 5831.88
into deranged idiots

5830.26 --> 5834.46
no

5831.88 --> 5836.56
that that wasn't the set out objective

5834.46 --> 5838.659
was it you just wouldn't take care of

5836.56 --> 5841.0
the world well you don't do it

5838.659 --> 5844.92
with a process that literally turns

5841.0 --> 5844.92
everybody into deranged idiots

5845.86 --> 5848.5599999999995
yeah

5847.0 --> 5852.46
you do it

5848.56 --> 5854.26
by enhancing people's sense of

5852.46 --> 5857.5
responsibility

5854.26 --> 5861.1
for their own conduct and life

5857.5 --> 5864.1
to live clean like actual physically

5861.1 --> 5867.3
clean with like garbage and chemicals

5864.1 --> 5869.8
not this nonsense carbon nonsense

5867.3 --> 5872.400000000001
industrial top-down

5869.8 --> 5872.400000000001
scam

5873.82 --> 5878.38
and just let people clean themselves up

5876.88 --> 5880.2390000000005
wake up

5878.38 --> 5882.84
you know because people that are

5880.239 --> 5886.0
actually woken up they do a lot of good

5882.84 --> 5888.159000000001
they take care of other people that

5886.0 --> 5890.32
aren't as woken up they take care of

5888.159 --> 5892.659
their environment which actually cleans

5890.32 --> 5896.08
the place up they give a huge moral

5892.659 --> 5898.48
boost which motivates even Outsiders

5896.08 --> 5901.0
to do their best more and become more

5898.48 --> 5903.879999999999
productive okay that's what you really

5901.0 --> 5905.159
want and then when that's happened and

5903.88 --> 5907.2390000000005
everybody's going in that direction

5905.159 --> 5909.699
guess what

5907.239 --> 5912.339999999999
there's going to be less

5909.699 --> 5914.98
people that just don't have any children

5912.34 --> 5918.04
and they're gonna fizzle While others

5914.98 --> 5920.86
like just explode to overcomposite and

5918.04 --> 5924.1
have like a lot of children but then

5920.86 --> 5926.0199999999995
with divided attention so they're not

5924.1 --> 5928.4800000000005
yeah they're going to probably be more

5926.02 --> 5933.159000000001
like workers not as much great thinkers

5928.48 --> 5935.739
I mean it's it's a solution temporarily

5933.159 --> 5940.659
but it's not a good contrast what you

5935.739 --> 5943.78
need is everybody being

5940.659 --> 5946.839999999999
on the average not like oh we can be

5943.78 --> 5949.9
just gay and not have kids and do drugs

5946.84 --> 5951.9400000000005
and everything we want because there are

5949.9 --> 5953.32
still these people that have like seven

5951.94 --> 5957.36
children

5953.32 --> 5957.36
yeah that doesn't solve anything

5961.719 --> 5965.699
you gotta average it out

5971.68 --> 5976.62
[Music]

5973.62 --> 5976.62
all right

5977.739 --> 5982.12
so yeah this got very serious all of a

5980.139 --> 5985.659000000001
sudden

5982.12 --> 5988.179
but it is it is very relevant

5985.659 --> 5990.719
yeah we don't have an overpopulation

5988.179 --> 5990.719
issue

5990.88 --> 5998.32
we have a potential population

5994.02 --> 6003.320000000001
collapse and potentially Extinction

5998.32 --> 6003.32
event coming out of that coming up yeah

6005.159 --> 6010.92
because if a certain percentage of the

6008.28 --> 6014.9
general public becomes genetically

6010.92 --> 6019.86
damaged and unable to procreate properly

6014.9 --> 6023.82
then the whole thing starts to wither

6019.86 --> 6025.92
crumble and then suddenly it's all gone

6023.82 --> 6029.88
and then entire

6025.92 --> 6034.02
like character types types of human

6029.88 --> 6036.84
beings May potentially never come back

6034.02 --> 6040.080000000001
do you understand

6036.84 --> 6042.659000000001
yeah entire types might never come back

6040.08 --> 6043.44
because of this [ __ ] in the last two

6042.659 --> 6046.44
years

6043.44 --> 6050.419999999999
we might lose entire character types

6046.44 --> 6050.419999999999
forever because of this

6053.86 --> 6058.42
[Music]

6059.46 --> 6064.679
right because yeah every generation

6062.159 --> 6066.5599999999995
there's a culture it's a situation some

6064.679 --> 6069.06
type of characters

6066.56 --> 6070.9800000000005
characteristics are looked up against

6069.06 --> 6072.719
and others are looked down upon well

6070.98 --> 6075.299999999999
guess what those character traits will

6072.719 --> 6077.28
become more dormant those there's people

6075.3 --> 6081.360000000001
might even die in a conflict or whatever

6077.28 --> 6082.98
because of it but then later Next

6081.36 --> 6086.759999999999
Generation

6082.98 --> 6088.08
they have a new chance to re-emerge as a

6086.76 --> 6090.96
character

6088.08 --> 6094.92
and do their thing again and now maybe

6090.96 --> 6098.159
the situation is better adapted to who

6094.92 --> 6102.96
how they would manifest right that way

6098.159 --> 6106.138999999999
everybody over the generations get a

6102.96 --> 6109.619
chance to manifest their characteristics

6106.139 --> 6112.08
but if you then spread poison around

6109.619 --> 6115.199
that literally like damage your

6112.08 --> 6117.8
reproduction potentially kills you well

6115.199 --> 6117.799999999999
guess what

6118.32 --> 6123.0
guess what's gonna happen no more no

6121.02 --> 6125.159000000001
more chance for those character types

6123.0 --> 6127.739
that were in their genes that were

6125.159 --> 6130.259999999999
literally riding on their jeans for the

6127.739 --> 6132.839999999999
future they will be gone

6130.26 --> 6136.1
do you understand how horrific this

6132.84 --> 6136.1
situation really is

6137.28 --> 6142.739
I mean even if we get these [ __ ]

6139.92 --> 6144.719
scumbags

6142.739 --> 6146.699
that have rolled this [ __ ] out with

6144.719 --> 6148.56
their Eugenics program and the vaccines

6146.699 --> 6150.419999999999
and all that even if we get them and

6148.56 --> 6155.1
they get the death penalty and they

6150.42 --> 6156.96
absolutely should no mercy yeah even

6155.1 --> 6159.3
after that's done

6156.96 --> 6161.58
it's not over yet

6159.3 --> 6163.9800000000005
we're gonna have to figure out a way to

6161.58 --> 6165.96
recover from this after that

6163.98 --> 6168.659
and we're probably gonna need bio

6165.96 --> 6170.34
Laboratories to do it yeah and at the

6168.659 --> 6172.5
end they've been counting on it it's

6170.34 --> 6175.38
part of their [ __ ] little plan these

6172.5 --> 6176.94
disgusting bastards

6175.38 --> 6180.4800000000005
yeah

6176.94 --> 6181.86
they [ __ ] us up so that we would need

6180.48 --> 6185.638999999999
them

6181.86 --> 6188.759999999999
it's literally an industrial investment

6185.639 --> 6191.76
to ensure that they don't get completely

6188.76 --> 6191.76
exterminated

6192.36 --> 6196.44
because they knew they're getting

6194.76 --> 6198.42
outdated they knew they were going to

6196.44 --> 6200.94
get unraveled they knew that the medical

6198.42 --> 6204.719
system as has been established in the

6200.94 --> 6208.739
last hundred years would the Resolute be

6204.719 --> 6211.92
figured out for what it is and end

6208.739 --> 6215.879999999999
in its setup

6211.92 --> 6220.139
and in its Eugenics power control

6215.88 --> 6221.46
and so they assaulted Humanity to damage

6220.139 --> 6224.9400000000005
them

6221.46 --> 6227.639
so that if we would kill them all off

6224.94 --> 6230.96
then we would also die that's what

6227.639 --> 6233.6990000000005
they're hoping for It's A desperate like

6230.96 --> 6237.0
Kamikaze tactic that they basically done

6233.699 --> 6239.219999999999
with this stupid vaccine situation

6237.0 --> 6244.6
and people don't even realize that

6239.22 --> 6244.6
[Music]

6246.6 --> 6252.119000000001
traits

6248.28 --> 6254.88
black dressing will you do uh

6252.119 --> 6256.5
I always dress black except when it's

6254.88 --> 6259.88
really hot and then I might have a white

6256.5 --> 6259.88
T-shirt so yeah

6260.51 --> 6266.719
[Music]

6263.219 --> 6266.719
I'll always be wearing black

6274.8 --> 6281.76
but yeah I'm never gonna go all cyber or

6278.4 --> 6282.839999999999
punkish or whatever I'm I'm Bland I'm

6281.76 --> 6286.56
like

6282.84 --> 6289.9800000000005
no logos no text type of black with very

6286.56 --> 6291.96
basic jewelry that's I just have my

6289.98 --> 6294.299999999999
style and that's what I look like I've

6291.96 --> 6298.08
looked like that for over half my life

6294.3 --> 6300.119000000001
now and I will so do so the rest of my

6298.08 --> 6302.4
life

6300.119 --> 6304.44
there's no other way I want to look this

6302.4 --> 6308.219
is just the way I look always wanted

6304.44 --> 6309.599999999999
that I literally like declared it in my

6308.219 --> 6312.54
vision

6309.6 --> 6314.910000000001
when I was 17 declared it

6312.54 --> 6318.1
like this is what I look like

6314.91 --> 6318.099999999999
[Music]

6318.119 --> 6321.96
anyway

6320.19 --> 6324.659
[Music]

6321.96 --> 6326.34
no text that's right except when it

6324.659 --> 6328.619
really matters just like with jewelry

6326.34 --> 6330.900000000001
right I don't like oh this jewelry

6328.619 --> 6333.36
they're all I'm gonna put all the kinds

6330.9 --> 6336.0
of jewels on no no no no

6333.36 --> 6338.099999999999
only things that I made

6336.0 --> 6342.06
yeah that's a part of the thing I only

6338.1 --> 6344.76
wear things that I have made

6342.06 --> 6347.639
when it comes to text

6344.76 --> 6351.659000000001
or jewelry I literally do not wear

6347.639 --> 6355.5
anything that I have not made myself

6351.659 --> 6357.719
right like my wing and all that only my

6355.5 --> 6359.82
own stuff and well I'm gonna take that

6357.719 --> 6364.52
the uh sun is a non-local hologram yeah

6359.82 --> 6364.5199999999995
I know but guess what that's my text

6364.679 --> 6370.38
it's literally my text not that I made

6367.38 --> 6373.92
the T-shirt but it's literally my text

6370.38 --> 6376.56
and it's kind of uniquely come out of me

6373.92 --> 6378.1
is really my thing so that is an

6376.56 --> 6380.9400000000005
acceptable exception

6378.1 --> 6383.639
[Music]

6380.94 --> 6386.159
right but I'd never wanted like on my

6383.639 --> 6387.36
jacket or on my sweater it's just gonna

6386.159 --> 6389.638999999999
be

6387.36 --> 6391.5599999999995
the T-shirt

6389.639 --> 6394.08
and I really like it I'm very happy

6391.56 --> 6398.3
about it but I can only wear this

6394.08 --> 6398.3

6501.42 --> 6506.88
[ __ ] anywhere on anything I wear

6505.139 --> 6508.63

6506.88 --> 6511.56
not a single thing

6508.63 --> 6513.96
[Music]

6511.56 --> 6517.52
except this one because this has been

6513.96 --> 6517.52
the first exception in

6520.08 --> 6522.86
through

6524.94 --> 6531.919999999999
wow okay this has been the first

6528.78 --> 6535.679
exception since I was eight

6531.92 --> 6538.679
last time I actually had text on a piece

6535.679 --> 6542.219
of clothing that I wear was when I was

6538.679 --> 6544.32
eight I I'm not even joking

6542.219 --> 6547.28
that's how consistent I've been with it

6544.32 --> 6552.08
I mean I've where I've worn like color

6547.28 --> 6557.0
shirts with all kinds of colors and like

6552.08 --> 6560.46
artistic with no text ever like never

6557.0 --> 6562.08
never ever except like when I was eight

6560.46 --> 6562.96
and I didn't really pay too much

6562.08 --> 6566.17
attention

6562.96 --> 6566.17
[Music]

6570.06 --> 6575.04
but after yeah it just became very aware

6573.119 --> 6577.5
I don't want to have text on me I don't

6575.04 --> 6579.06
want to have text on me because it

6577.5 --> 6581.28
literally makes me feel like a mind

6579.06 --> 6583.080000000001
control slave

6581.28 --> 6585.119
and I thought that about other people

6583.08 --> 6586.5599999999995
that would always do that every time

6585.119 --> 6588.719
you'll see somebody like oh it took

6586.56 --> 6590.52
something it's always stupid text and

6588.719 --> 6592.32
I'm like you're a [ __ ] slave you

6590.52 --> 6594.6
don't even know what the [ __ ] you put on

6592.32 --> 6596.639
there why are you wearing that why are

6594.6 --> 6598.5
you wanting other people to read that

6596.639 --> 6600.42
you don't understand what that is you

6598.5 --> 6601.5
don't understand anything that's going

6600.42 --> 6603.32
on

6601.5 --> 6606.0
foreign

6603.32 --> 6608.179
that's my response to that it might be a

6606.0 --> 6611.62
little bit of an overreaction but it is

6608.179 --> 6614.0
a natural response

6611.62 --> 6616.86
[Music]

6614.0 --> 6619.86
I cannot imagine me in a three-piece

6616.86 --> 6622.739

6619.86 --> 6626.48
I can well not without well not with a

6622.739 --> 6626.48
