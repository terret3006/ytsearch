appreciated

221.28 --> 225.62
I always use the support

223.5 --> 228.599
I've noticed by the way

225.62 --> 232.04
that Godzilla is my only patreon

228.599 --> 232.04
supporter left at this point

232.08 --> 235.22
just kind of weird

236.04 --> 240.9
what happened to gaining wisdom

238.56 --> 243.84
had heard from him in a while

240.9 --> 246.42000000000002
but anyway yeah

243.84 --> 247.799
I guess I'm not very popular on patreon

246.42 --> 251.04
but yeah

247.799 --> 253.37900000000002
I'm still doing great with PayPal

251.04 --> 255.659
for through you guys so yeah I can't

253.379 --> 257.34
really complain but it is a bit weird

255.659 --> 259.94
don't know why

257.34 --> 259.94
uh

260.28 --> 266.71999999999997
hey Mike saidunich first in chat anyway

263.4 --> 266.71999999999997
the weather is

267.54 --> 272.52000000000004
yeah

269.88 --> 275.21999999999997
very similar to yesterday

272.52 --> 277.25899999999996
a bit more cloudy

275.22 --> 280.759
but not a lot of thick clouds there's

277.259 --> 280.759
like this sheet

280.85 --> 286.74
[Music]

283.32 --> 288.96
Cloud slash sheath covering

286.74 --> 290.82
with just a bit of blue here and there

288.96 --> 294.12
but yeah there's not a lot of sun coming

290.82 --> 296.699
through this morning there was though

294.12 --> 300.18
but yeah it uh

296.699 --> 302.16
it turned clouded in the last few hours

300.18 --> 305.46
so

302.16 --> 309.02000000000004
and yeah it is cold

305.46 --> 309.02
at least I it feels cold

310.639 --> 314.34000000000003
I will check the weather

313.139 --> 316.02
anyway

314.34 --> 319.82
I'm actually doing each first in chat

316.02 --> 319.82
cinch man good to see you

320.34 --> 326.82
I will support you when I find oh okay I

324.12 --> 330.539
didn't know you were doing bad

326.82 --> 333.919
had a turn a setback

330.539 --> 333.919
anyway I thank you

333.96 --> 336.56
t-shirt

338.1 --> 342.6
s

339.9 --> 347.69899999999996
what

342.6 --> 349.97900000000004
oh okay cinch man sure uh

347.699 --> 352.259
anyway there's been some Mix-Ups also

349.979 --> 354.919
with like show Numbers it's been really

352.259 --> 354.91900000000004
confusing

355.259 --> 361.32
so at some point I just started to

358.32 --> 361.32
disconnects

361.979 --> 369.06
but I set it straight so yeah it might

364.8 --> 370.979
have called the show Numbers wrong

369.06 --> 372.96
because there's been a mix up in the

370.979 --> 374.52
last

372.96 --> 377.15999999999997
week

374.52 --> 379.08
and yeah

377.16 --> 381.53900000000004
yesterday

379.08 --> 384.479
that was pretty good

381.539 --> 388.639
and then I watched back

384.479 --> 388.639
Flat Earth debates from Monday

388.919 --> 395.81899999999996
where I actually basically went

392.22 --> 399.36
uh yeah quit the the live show because I

395.819 --> 401.639
uh I got romperson straw man and really

399.36 --> 405.06
pissed off but

401.639 --> 407.1
something that now watching back much

405.06 --> 409.62
more calmly there were a lot of things

407.1 --> 411.84000000000003
that stood out to me including how

409.62 --> 413.039
incredibly

411.84 --> 416.17999999999995
feeble

413.039 --> 419.52
I actually seem to be and it's weird

416.18 --> 421.979
because when that was happening I did

419.52 --> 424.979
not feel like that at all I actually

421.979 --> 426.68
felt quite strong but there seemed to

424.979 --> 428.58
have been some

426.68 --> 431.28000000000003
internal

428.58 --> 433.38
disconnect

431.28 --> 436.08
it's really weird to see that back

433.38 --> 438.24
because I remember exactly from my

436.08 --> 440.039
vantage point how it felt what I was

438.24 --> 441.06
doing what I had in mind and I had all

440.039 --> 442.919
kinds of

441.06 --> 445.38
grudges

442.919 --> 447.12
that have been like building up

445.38 --> 450.919
slowly

447.12 --> 450.919
and the winter setting in

451.199 --> 455.72
but it's really weird to actually see

453.36 --> 455.72
myself

456.599 --> 462.479
like from another perspective and it

458.639 --> 466.699
wasn't as strong as I wanted to be

462.479 --> 466.699
and then in retrospect

466.74 --> 471.479
yeah I mean the guys have been really

469.02 --> 474.18
gracious with me and I do feel that I I

471.479 --> 477.419
should probably make an apology

474.18 --> 478.62
but or clarification maybe they get it I

477.419 --> 480.78
don't know

478.62 --> 485.34000000000003
it's just weird watching it back and

480.78 --> 488.039
just it didn't look from the outside at

485.34 --> 489.78
all as well what I was feeling on the

488.039 --> 493.02
inside

489.78 --> 496.73999999999995
and that was yeah a minor shock but also

493.02 --> 500.96
typical realization like oh [ __ ]

496.74 --> 500.96000000000004
I might not be entirely stable

504.599 --> 509.21999999999997
right and I'm very good to recognize

507.06 --> 511.379
instabilities with other people but

509.22 --> 512.7
apparently when I'm literally undergoing

511.379 --> 515.219
it

512.7 --> 517.5
I do not have that same

515.219 --> 520.8000000000001
skill level

517.5 --> 523.2
in sizing it up with myself

520.8 --> 525.3599999999999
but I don't pay a lot of attention to it

523.2 --> 527.6400000000001
either because I'm just trying to be

525.36 --> 529.38
natural at all times and following this

527.64 --> 532.019
pattern of like no matter what happens

529.38 --> 535.019
to me no matter how crazy or deprived I

532.019 --> 537.6
get for whatever reason

535.019 --> 538.92
after always build up from the very

537.6 --> 541.44
moment

538.92 --> 544.92
using the principles every time it's

541.44 --> 548.1600000000001
like I expect to suddenly get some weird

544.92 --> 550.92
Fugue of dementia

548.16 --> 552.66
like I'm not getting it but I I've

550.92 --> 554.9399999999999
actually well through Dark World

552.66 --> 557.76
experiences experience a lot of things

554.94 --> 560.399
that can happen to a person and it's one

557.76 --> 562.26
of the things that kept me busy for

560.399 --> 564.54
those 80 years is to basically

562.26 --> 566.459
neurotically train myself to always

564.54 --> 568.98
figure out something that I could learn

566.459 --> 571.92
about what I was undergoing because I

568.98 --> 573.899
did realize this isn't actually me but I

571.92 --> 575.399
could not

573.899 --> 578.22
stop

575.399 --> 580.98
the feeling entanglements that were

578.22 --> 584.1600000000001
giving me the impression that it was me

580.98 --> 586.5600000000001
but I had a conscious realization of it

584.16 --> 589.74
at some point during the process

586.56 --> 591.66
and so I just applied the same rule you

589.74 --> 594.1800000000001
always have to get something productive

591.66 --> 597.24
out of whatever is happening including

594.18 --> 599.4799999999999
going through hell and so I did and it

597.24 --> 603.2
did actually work out

599.48 --> 603.2
yeah but

603.36 --> 608.4590000000001
yeah I have

605.48 --> 609.1
distinct moments where I just tend to

608.459 --> 612.2399999999999
get weaker

609.1 --> 614.76
[Music]

612.24 --> 617.339
and with it also comes the frustration

614.76 --> 618.66
of actually being quite competent and

617.339 --> 621.0
strong

618.66 --> 624.0799999999999
and having done that successfully and

621.0 --> 624.08
then basically

624.18 --> 629.2199999999999
getting used to that

626.1 --> 631.8000000000001
and then you suddenly go downhill and

629.22 --> 634.26
then you have to let it go

631.8 --> 636.26
and that is also extremely difficult and

634.26 --> 639.72
frustrating anyway

636.26 --> 643.08
uh lots of people in the chat right now

639.72 --> 645.12
five routes letter Sage at least G good

643.08 --> 648.9590000000001
CU Scott

645.12 --> 650.339
I'll use those work together yeah

648.959 --> 653.0999999999999
but

650.339 --> 657.0
yeah when I feel like this I smoke less

653.1 --> 658.9200000000001
because it like it makes too much impact

657.0 --> 660.9
so

658.92 --> 664.669
that's what it is

660.9 --> 664.669
[Music]

664.68 --> 670.1999999999999
that's what it is uh what do you mean oh

668.279 --> 674.18
it's just the smoking

670.2 --> 674.1800000000001
or age inspiring no

677.64 --> 680.54
no it's not

683.459 --> 688.399
the rage and the spiraling is just a

685.86 --> 688.399
response

691.32 --> 696.36
I mean I rage and spiraled just as well

694.26 --> 699.6
without smoking

696.36 --> 703.4590000000001
although it is practically more easy

699.6 --> 706.6800000000001
when I don't smoke to keep it to myself

703.459 --> 709.14
in the moment a contemporary Advantage

706.68 --> 711.959
but you see there's a long-term

709.14 --> 715.019
disadvantage of keeping it under control

711.959 --> 716.5189999999999
that I've also learned about in my life

715.019 --> 718.74
yeah

716.519 --> 719.7
and the end result of that is a lot

718.74 --> 722.12
worse

719.7 --> 725.519
it actually turns into like

722.12 --> 728.899
hallucinatory nightmares

725.519 --> 728.899
and I've had enough of those

729.02 --> 733.37
[Music]

733.5 --> 738.06
that's what yeah

735.48 --> 742.1
yeah well I I have

738.06 --> 742.0999999999999
the days where I smoke very little

742.62 --> 746.839
uh two days ago was one of those days

750.48 --> 754.16
that is yeah

754.44 --> 758.6400000000001
so

756.12 --> 761.04
there are there's at least one or two

758.64 --> 763.079
days every week where I do not smoke

761.04 --> 766.459
much I mostly just

763.079 --> 766.459
swept tobacco and

766.98 --> 772.5
so yeah I know what it is like dude I've

770.16 --> 775.459
been smoking more than half my life

772.5 --> 775.459
Scott

778.2 --> 783.6
I I know how this works

781.26 --> 785.8199999999999
you're not the first one to say oh is

783.6 --> 787.98
that it yeah because every freaking

785.82 --> 790.019
social worker I've ever come across

787.98 --> 795.36
except for the ones that are smokers

790.019 --> 798.18
themselves which does happen now okay

795.36 --> 799.86
they all say the same thing it's always

798.18 --> 801.4799999999999
the first figure oh we're just looking

799.86 --> 803.4590000000001
good at this yeah yeah because there are

801.48 --> 805.32
a lot of people that totally don't know

803.459 --> 806.88
what what they're basically engaging in

805.32 --> 808.86
they don't know what cannabis actually

806.88 --> 812.279
does to you

808.86 --> 814.98
they take too much they get too strong

812.279 --> 817.32
they keep climbing that strength curve

814.98 --> 819.72
yeah and then [ __ ] goes wrong especially

817.32 --> 823.7
if you get into the sativa

819.72 --> 823.7
yeah I know all about it

828.36 --> 833.739
yeah I'm very careful

830.22 --> 833.739
[Music]

836.6 --> 842.1
and like 20 years ago I've had times

839.76 --> 844.019
where I was not very careful and I would

842.1 --> 847.2
end up in like temporary sort of

844.019 --> 850.019
delirium steak

847.2 --> 852.72
which is pretty nightmarish but it

850.019 --> 855.66
remains passive though I mean delirium

852.72 --> 857.82
steak with cannabis is terrible but it's

855.66 --> 859.86
not even half as terrible as like when

857.82 --> 861.4200000000001
you get that with alcohol which is like

859.86 --> 862.5600000000001
really terrible

861.42 --> 864.66
ugh

862.56 --> 867.2399999999999
but uh

864.66 --> 869.76
I know what I'm doing

867.24 --> 872.399
and

869.76 --> 877.22
what happened Monday

872.399 --> 877.22
was not directly because of cannabis

879.18 --> 884.4799999999999
but

880.44 --> 884.48
it would not have helped a lot

886.65 --> 889.84
[Music]

890.04 --> 896.16
maybe there was a little bit of elastic

892.5 --> 899.76
effect because I think that last Sunday

896.16 --> 903.24
I smoked almost nothing cannabis wise

899.76 --> 904.74
and then Monday I did get cannabis

903.24 --> 907.38
and

904.74 --> 911.48
I think I probably smoked my first joint

907.38 --> 911.48
actually during the show so that is

911.639 --> 914.639
hmm

922.079 --> 926.459
well if that did happen that that's

924.3 --> 929.06
certainly weird

926.459 --> 929.06
way

932.339 --> 937.98
that was something no because

934.92 --> 941.639
I fed a couple of odd things happening

937.98 --> 945.3000000000001
this week like outside of the internet

941.639 --> 947.94
like one day at the coffee shop I I know

945.3 --> 951.3599999999999
the owner by the way he is I think an

947.94 --> 955.8000000000001
Israeli Jews but he seems to be a pretty

951.36 --> 959.279
good guy and he's like he loves his

955.8 --> 961.199
his spot like he loves his coffee shop

959.279 --> 964.56
and cannabis and

961.199 --> 965.88
all that and so he's not just there for

964.56 --> 969.779
the squeeze

965.88 --> 972.48
pretty good guy referred you but

969.779 --> 975.06
he had this machine that I've never seen

972.48 --> 977.6990000000001
and they were like selling they started

975.06 --> 979.1389999999999
resin and it's like yeah totally new I

977.699 --> 981.5999999999999
thought it was hash cheese first but it

979.139 --> 985.76
wasn't and then he basically just gave

981.6 --> 988.8000000000001
me a try and that thing made freaking

985.76 --> 991.4399999999999
hella impact on me so much that it

988.8 --> 993.4799999999999
almost fell over

991.44 --> 995.7600000000001
right and that was like the first talk

993.48 --> 997.74
of the day even and I did not expect it

995.76 --> 1000.079
to be that strong at all

997.74 --> 1002.5600000000001
I'm not sure whether that was Monday

1000.079 --> 1002.56
though

1005.48 --> 1010.759
no no that was Tuesday

1009.079 --> 1013.42
that was the day when I was already

1010.759 --> 1013.42
staying okay

1015.139 --> 1018.639
just trying to figure out

1020.3 --> 1023.42
probably have to be Wednesday now it

1021.86 --> 1025.779
wasn't what I'm pretty sure it wasn't

1023.42 --> 1025.779
Monday

1028.64 --> 1032.66
anyway

1029.74 --> 1034.28
that was certainly unexpected because I

1032.66 --> 1037.88
even said it to the

1034.28 --> 1039.74
coffee shop guy I I burst out in

1037.88 --> 1042.38
coughing and I haven't done that in like

1039.74 --> 1043.579
over a decade is really weird to

1042.38 --> 1045.3190000000002
experience that

1043.579 --> 1046.8799999999999
I'm just coughing because it's too

1045.319 --> 1048.319
strong

1046.88 --> 1051.74
and

1048.319 --> 1056.36
just pure this cannabis stuff no tobacco

1051.74 --> 1059.419
edit and bang I mean I hadn't felt any

1056.36 --> 1061.6999999999998
yeah it felt like I was 17 or something

1059.419 --> 1063.38
it was like oh [ __ ] it's way too strong

1061.7 --> 1065.9
again and they were like oh yeah it's

1063.38 --> 1068.179
working right and I'm like yeah no that

1065.9 --> 1070.52
was kind of the part that I'm glad I'm a

1068.179 --> 1072.8600000000001
bit older because

1070.52 --> 1074.84
it was way too strong a lot of the time

1072.86 --> 1077.299
back then and I didn't really actually

1074.84 --> 1079.3999999999999
like that part about it so it's like

1077.299 --> 1081.02
waiting till like the craziness goes

1079.4 --> 1084.6200000000001
away and then

1081.02 --> 1087.22
she takes like 15 20 minutes

1084.62 --> 1087.2199999999998
uh

1087.559 --> 1093.74
Jewish good guy how dare you is this

1091.88 --> 1095.24
oh he is pretty cool

1093.74 --> 1098.66
it's not like he's wearing it he's

1095.24 --> 1100.9
always wearing a yamaka or something but

1098.66 --> 1104.299
he is just yeah

1100.9 --> 1107.7800000000002
I know I like it he's pretty awesome

1104.299 --> 1112.039
I mean he did actually during the

1107.78 --> 1116.1789999999999
lockdown [ __ ] and all that in 2021

1112.039 --> 1119.5
he did actually well Force everybody who

1116.179 --> 1123.46
went there to wear a mask but to be fair

1119.5 --> 1123.46
all coffee shops did

1126.08 --> 1130.22
but I did even like had a bit of a

1128.419 --> 1133.72
Fallout against him over I was like how

1130.22 --> 1133.72
dare you make me do that

1136.22 --> 1139.96
but yeah then eventually it's just like

1138.74 --> 1145.66
ah

1139.96 --> 1149.38
but he doesn't do that anymore I mean so

1145.66 --> 1149.38
he is a cool guy

1150.65 --> 1157.52
[Music]

1152.84 --> 1159.74
also I think he he is pretty smart but I

1157.52 --> 1162.94
don't know if he actually knows a lot of

1159.74 --> 1162.94
like really smart people

1163.039 --> 1169.94
because every time I I say something

1166.64 --> 1172.8200000000002
like I do Armenian style I like lay down

1169.94 --> 1176.1200000000001
a piece of insight and he's there he

1172.82 --> 1178.039
does always listen so he is aware that

1176.12 --> 1180.08
I'm a smart person and I think he even

1178.039 --> 1181.46
like picks up a few things

1180.08 --> 1182.6599999999999
sometimes

1181.46 --> 1185.48
so

1182.66 --> 1187.46
but yeah very serious always always I'm

1185.48 --> 1189.559
trying to represent right

1187.46 --> 1191.48
it's like oh oh you want to have a

1189.559 --> 1194.12
conversation well guess what it's gonna

1191.48 --> 1196.1
represent I like oh the music they're

1194.12 --> 1198.08
playing like immediately like oh this is

1196.1 --> 1200.4189999999999
80s oh this is 90s oh

1198.08 --> 1202.6999999999998
how was it then

1200.419 --> 1205.4
I'll just start talking about how I

1202.7 --> 1209.8400000000001
recognize that it was from that era and

1205.4 --> 1212.68
all that you know whatever happens

1209.84 --> 1215.749
I'll just do such things

1212.68 --> 1215.749
[Music]

1219.38 --> 1223.179
anyway

1220.46 --> 1223.179
uh

1223.46 --> 1226.96
blue Supreme knowing

1229.039 --> 1234.919
a huge hug from someone else would be

1231.559 --> 1236.0
yeah I know oh oh there there's another

1234.919 --> 1238.5800000000002
one

1236.0 --> 1240.82
yeah what also happened pretty much last

1238.58 --> 1240.82
weekend

1241.7 --> 1246.26
yeah what had been also on the long run

1244.039 --> 1248.539
and I even mentioned is that like well

1246.26 --> 1250.34
my favorite roommate went away that it

1248.539 --> 1255.1
kind of was a bit in love with

1250.34 --> 1255.1
which was really nice and I miss her

1255.2 --> 1260.179
like it's the winter is a bit colder

1257.72 --> 1265.58
without her being there

1260.179 --> 1266.92
this sounds silly but yeah I mean

1265.58 --> 1270.019
whatever

1266.92 --> 1270.019
[Music]

1270.38 --> 1273.88
hey Terry 306

1291.38 --> 1295.1000000000001
and starts to leave my system a little

1293.72 --> 1296.48
bit

1295.1 --> 1299.1789999999999
uh

1296.48 --> 1303.2
no

1299.179 --> 1306.44
Scott you're getting it totally wrong

1303.2 --> 1309.14
it's exactly the other way around

1306.44 --> 1312.2
I have the most like

1309.14 --> 1314.7800000000002
when it starts to leave my system

1312.2 --> 1318.28
now that's actually when I basically

1314.78 --> 1318.28
become more Unchained

1318.559 --> 1322.6
I become more of the way that I am

1326.179 --> 1332.6000000000001
because smoking actually practically

1330.1 --> 1335.08
makes me a little bit more reserved

1332.6 --> 1338.5
because I'm dealing with more

1335.08 --> 1338.5
internal issues

1340.58 --> 1345.34
like it forces me to be a little calmer

1346.7 --> 1351.679
dude you know

1349.34 --> 1353.98
you need to stop you're getting on my

1351.679 --> 1353.98
nerves

1355.88 --> 1359.48
yeah if that's the way you're gonna talk

1357.86 --> 1361.28
to me I'm gonna take your wrench and I'm

1359.48 --> 1363.559
gonna kick you the [ __ ] out of my show

1361.28 --> 1366.3799999999999
you here

1363.559 --> 1368.1789999999999
don't talk to me like that yeah yeah

1366.38 --> 1371.2
okay just trying to help yeah yeah I've

1368.179 --> 1371.2
had a lot of help

1371.84 --> 1376.9599999999998
and I need you to stop doing that

1374.539 --> 1376.96
because

1377.299 --> 1381.679
if that is how you're gonna see me then

1379.7 --> 1384.38
there's nothing that you can get out of

1381.679 --> 1388.659
me and that's what I'm doing here

1384.38 --> 1388.659
you know it's true yeah goodbye

1389.89 --> 1393.0790000000002
[Music]

1394.4 --> 1399.8200000000002
yeah that's that's your cue to get the

1397.1 --> 1399.82
[ __ ] out Scott

1401.57 --> 1411.9189999999999
[Music]

1406.88 --> 1414.3200000000002
yeah I probably smoked longer

1411.919 --> 1417.919
then yeah

1414.32 --> 1419.6599999999999
then have most people's lives

1417.919 --> 1423.3200000000002
okay

1419.66 --> 1426.26
[Music]

1423.32 --> 1428.0
and have had prolonged periods where I

1426.26 --> 1430.4
did not smoke at all

1428.0 --> 1432.2
became a very different person

1430.4 --> 1434.919
a better person

1432.2 --> 1434.919
no

1441.38 --> 1446.2990000000002
yeah why I even brought it up back up

1443.78 --> 1449.0
the Monday situation

1446.299 --> 1451.1
was because something had slipped my

1449.0 --> 1453.02
attention I figured out that there is a

1451.1 --> 1456.02
there was a

1453.02 --> 1456.02
experiencing

1456.26 --> 1462.919
an experience schism

1459.559 --> 1466.34
where I was from where I was then locked

1462.919 --> 1469.2800000000002
in into more internal world with a lot

1466.34 --> 1473.78
of passion and confliction

1469.28 --> 1476.0
wow my ex my extrovert

1473.78 --> 1478.34
abilities like my communication

1476.0 --> 1482.0
abilities were actually kind of low

1478.34 --> 1484.58
energy but when you're in that state you

1482.0 --> 1487.82
don't see that your lower energy output

1484.58 --> 1489.32
it's really weird yeah it's called

1487.82 --> 1492.86
analysis

1489.32 --> 1495.22
is what I do that's how I learn from my

1492.86 --> 1495.2199999999998
mistakes

1496.94 --> 1502.48
[Music]

1500.96 --> 1507.919
yeah

1502.48 --> 1510.8600000000001
and cannabis is very little influence on

1507.919 --> 1513.26
it on on the long run

1510.86 --> 1514.6999999999998
because I've been smoking

1513.26 --> 1518.12
Bailey

1514.7 --> 1520.419
uh pretty much the entire early bird

1518.12 --> 1520.4189999999999
show

1520.82 --> 1526.34
pretty much since I came on YouTube

1524.6 --> 1531.1999999999998
okay

1526.34 --> 1533.539
so you don't even know who I am

1531.2 --> 1537.88
when I don't smoke because that was

1533.539 --> 1537.8799999999999
before that time way before that time

1540.38 --> 1545.5390000000002
we're talking like 2011.

1547.159 --> 1550.3600000000001
because

1548.6 --> 1553.84
twin

1550.36 --> 1553.84
2011 and

1555.02 --> 1561.52
2003

1557.72 --> 1561.52
I did not smoke cannabis

1569.059 --> 1573.799
amazing because I'm thinking back I'm

1571.88 --> 1576.0800000000002
pausing it's like it was eight years

1573.799 --> 1578.539
when was the eight years yeah yeah

1576.08 --> 1580.58
exactly there 11 so it has to be three

1578.539 --> 1582.62
and then it's like oh thank God it

1580.58 --> 1585.5
actually fit it thank God what I

1582.62 --> 1588.62
remember actually fits I'm not going

1585.5 --> 1591.98
crazy but yeah

1588.62 --> 1594.1999999999998
it was in that period and it was a very

1591.98 --> 1598.4
different type of person

1594.2 --> 1600.5
much more stoic and to myself

1598.4 --> 1605.72
it was interesting

1600.5 --> 1605.72
but it was also in ways miserable

1609.38 --> 1613.88
I mean cannabis does kind of give me

1612.02 --> 1616.52
more

1613.88 --> 1619.159
[Music]

1616.52 --> 1621.2
more sensory range that's yeah that's

1619.159 --> 1623.6000000000001
exactly what it does

1621.2 --> 1625.3400000000001
and that's potentially dangerous guess

1623.6 --> 1628.4599999999998
what your senses

1625.34 --> 1630.6789999999999
it's like Oh I'm a snail and my eye has

1628.46 --> 1633.32
a longer stick well that means you're

1630.679 --> 1637.48
probably also could get more impact

1633.32 --> 1637.48
and I'm aware of that I'm an empath

1638.179 --> 1643.659
right

1639.26 --> 1648.64
but with my empathy it's not just misery

1643.659 --> 1648.64
that I feel more thank God

1648.86 --> 1652.6999999999998
so

1650.96 --> 1655.419
[Music]

1652.7 --> 1655.419
ah

1655.64 --> 1660.74
foreign

1657.72 --> 1663.14
[Music]

1660.74 --> 1664.82
and by the way for the record I'm gonna

1663.14 --> 1670.0590000000002
unban Scott tomorrow

1664.82 --> 1670.059
and you better never do that again

1671.12 --> 1676.4799999999998
because I do not accept people

1672.74 --> 1676.48
addressing me like that

1677.059 --> 1681.44
that's a fact I don't I don't care I

1679.22 --> 1684.08
don't care if I'm like dying and all you

1681.44 --> 1687.02
needed to do was prevent me from taking

1684.08 --> 1689.779
that one last talk to save my life I

1687.02 --> 1692.4189999999999
still will not accept anybody

1689.779 --> 1695.6
talking to me when I'm in a live

1692.419 --> 1698.5
streaming capacity like that

1695.6 --> 1698.5
and that's that

1701.58 --> 1706.01
[Music]

1708.37 --> 1716.3799999999999
[Music]

1712.88 --> 1716.38
hey PG Cru Shank

1719.419 --> 1723.279
PJ CNET also

1723.38 --> 1726.279
uh

1726.74 --> 1729.859
[Music]

1742.34 --> 1747.6789999999999
yep

1743.72 --> 1750.02
yep you see that makes perfect sense

1747.679 --> 1754.1000000000001
in the first few times that I smoked it

1750.02 --> 1758.539
I was super super super like Elysium

1754.1 --> 1762.08
field level relaxed it was amazing

1758.539 --> 1765.559
but after that it all transformed it's

1762.08 --> 1768.86
like it's never been like that and yeah

1765.559 --> 1772.76
I miss it a bit but it's all right

1768.86 --> 1775.399
I tried just not to want that specific

1772.76 --> 1777.58
thing back and in minor ways I do get it

1775.399 --> 1777.58
back

1783.5 --> 1787.7
right and the paranoia yeah well that's

1785.899 --> 1790.6999999999998
all about like

1787.7 --> 1793.64
what is in your mind what is in your

1790.7 --> 1795.0800000000002
spirit energy the moment you're taking

1793.64 --> 1797.2990000000002
the toke

1795.08 --> 1799.8799999999999
right every like

1797.299 --> 1801.98
I take it very seriously it's like you

1799.88 --> 1804.8600000000001
have to be consciously aware and

1801.98 --> 1807.559
disciplined in what what's going on in

1804.86 --> 1810.02
your internals even to smoke

1807.559 --> 1812.36
being me like I have to do that if I

1810.02 --> 1815.32
don't I immediately like oh Jesus where

1812.36 --> 1815.32
did I just end up

1815.36 --> 1819.32
I have to yeah

1817.94 --> 1821.419
so

1819.32 --> 1822.27
cannabis smoking to me is also a bit

1821.419 --> 1825.46
like sparring

1822.27 --> 1825.46
[Music]

1834.2 --> 1840.02
because yeah you can get paranoid but

1837.08 --> 1843.32
mostly the paranoia comes from

1840.02 --> 1845.0
this sativa strains

1843.32 --> 1848.3799999999999
so

1845.0 --> 1853.039
ended like the really strong one or

1848.38 --> 1853.3500000000001
N9 whatever maybe means to some grower

1853.039 --> 1855.08
people

1853.35 --> 1857.36
[Music]

1855.08 --> 1860.02
the strong ones right

1857.36 --> 1860.02
uh

1861.53 --> 1864.71
[Music]

1866.779 --> 1871.7
never get paranoid well then you're

1868.76 --> 1874.58
probably just smoking a good a good type

1871.7 --> 1877.22
making Indica type

1874.58 --> 1879.5
especially not the super strong Indica

1877.22 --> 1881.779
ones are just they never make you

1879.5 --> 1885.34
paranoid

1881.779 --> 1885.34
not in my experience at least

1889.159 --> 1892.3990000000001
anyway

1890.419 --> 1895.46
I don't want to make this entire show

1892.399 --> 1899.32
about cannabis at all because I don't

1895.46 --> 1899.32
want that to be like a subject

1899.36 --> 1905.059
yeah this is not

1901.46 --> 1907.3400000000001
the coffee shop hangout man

1905.059 --> 1910.1589999999999
especially because it's a Morning Show I

1907.34 --> 1912.559
mean come on that's not good

1910.159 --> 1915.6200000000001
like I'm a cannabis smoker regularly and

1912.559 --> 1917.779
I never smoke like in the morning

1915.62 --> 1920.4189999999999
like really early in the morning unless

1917.779 --> 1922.96
it's like I had a really weird

1920.419 --> 1922.96
night

1923.48 --> 1927.7
and then I'm expected to like

1925.279 --> 1932.74
immediately go back to sleep then maybe

1927.7 --> 1932.74
but that's very rare too

1944.14 --> 1950.0590000000002
awaken me well for me how I basically

1947.779 --> 1953.179
see it has to be a period every day

1950.059 --> 1956.1789999999999
where I consciously am just not high

1953.179 --> 1958.039
and whether that's in the night

1956.179 --> 1960.14
or in the morning

1958.039 --> 1961.94
doesn't really matter to me but there

1960.14 --> 1963.98
has to be a period

1961.94 --> 1966.799
if I would be continually under

1963.98 --> 1968.8700000000001
influence then eventually like my system

1966.799 --> 1971.539
will start to buckle

1968.87 --> 1973.6999999999998
[Music]

1971.539 --> 1975.86
to just have to accept like no there's a

1973.7 --> 1978.2
period in the day every day where I have

1975.86 --> 1981.52
to be sober

1978.2 --> 1981.52
just have to be

1983.98 --> 1990.2
and besides in that type of phase

1987.34 --> 1992.4189999999999
usually that's when

1990.2 --> 1994.1000000000001
a lot of the cannabinoids start doing

1992.419 --> 1996.019
their work actually

1994.1 --> 1999.08
it's not like in the middle of the high

1996.019 --> 2001.1200000000001
no it's afterward

1999.08 --> 2002.74
that's when your body is certainly like

2001.12 --> 2004.6
oh hey we got all these cannabinoids

2002.74 --> 2007.36
let's recover

2004.6 --> 2009.6399999999999
then regeneration processes

2007.36 --> 2014.5
this is really important to me to keep

2009.64 --> 2017.46
that phase in the day every day

2014.5 --> 2017.46
anyway

2018.58 --> 2023.22
we can bake yeah but that's terrible

2020.799 --> 2023.22
Theory

2033.24 --> 2037.86
habitual

2035.08 --> 2037.86
yeah

2038.86 --> 2046.019
what's a color to me

2041.5 --> 2046.019
okay Cleary the [ __ ]

2048.04 --> 2054.52
well you know when I was in my college

2051.099 --> 2057.099
days sort of there I knew people that

2054.52 --> 2058.899
would do that and we're like no I I wake

2057.099 --> 2062.2000000000003
up and the first thing I do is like take

2058.899 --> 2064.2999999999997
a puff of pure marijuana

2062.2 --> 2067.6589999999997
because that that would help them focus

2064.3 --> 2068.619
better somehow and they seem to get

2067.659 --> 2069.879
through

2068.619 --> 2072.04
fine

2069.879 --> 2074.02
so I was always weirded me out but

2072.04 --> 2077.859
apparently there's some people that do

2074.02 --> 2081.0
that or that have done that I don't know

2077.859 --> 2081.0
it's not my thing

2081.28 --> 2088.2400000000002
besides I typically have like

2084.52 --> 2091.0
early I have more like yeah my stomach

2088.24 --> 2093.2799999999997
issues and [ __ ] so

2091.0 --> 2095.139
have to be careful with breakfast and

2093.28 --> 2097.0400000000004
not like start smoking

2095.139 --> 2098.38
because that's just too punishing

2097.04 --> 2100.9
[Music]

2098.38 --> 2102.88
and by the way I've always had that like

2100.9 --> 2105.4
even as a team

2102.88 --> 2107.23
even before I was ever drinking or

2105.4 --> 2110.44
smoking

2107.23 --> 2110.44
[Music]

2111.28 --> 2118.6600000000003
it was quite a nag actually having to be

2114.04 --> 2121.7799999999997
on in school early every every weekday

2118.66 --> 2125.46
when a lot of those times I would be

2121.78 --> 2125.46
like very sickly

2125.8 --> 2130.9390000000003
and I had to go anyway

2127.53 --> 2130.9390000000003
[Music]

2131.26 --> 2138.099
right because you can't just skip

2135.579 --> 2140.26
several days a month

2138.099 --> 2143.1400000000003
because of my sickliness because then

2140.26 --> 2145.1800000000003
you become that exception [ __ ] to

2143.14 --> 2147.2799999999997
other kids that don't give a [ __ ]

2145.18 --> 2148.5989999999997
they'll just see it as a weakness which

2147.28 --> 2152.13
it is

2148.599 --> 2155.309
so I just could never give in to that

2152.13 --> 2155.309
[Music]

2155.68 --> 2162.7599999999998
maybe that's also well a bit of a reflex

2158.74 --> 2165.339
in how I consistently want to do an

2162.76 --> 2167.38
early bird show every day even when I do

2165.339 --> 2169.9
kind of feel sick then I just try to fix

2167.38 --> 2172.48
it it's what I did when I was a kid in

2169.9 --> 2175.2400000000002
school too

2172.48 --> 2176.2
and it was sometimes really a Titanic

2175.24 --> 2179.3199999999997
effort

2176.2 --> 2181.4199999999996
because I did not have anybody teaching

2179.32 --> 2186.2400000000002
me about that

2181.42 --> 2186.2400000000002
I had to figure it all out intuitively

2187.119 --> 2192.04
I I barely even talked to my parents

2190.18 --> 2194.44
about it did you know that

2192.04 --> 2196.599
like at some point they were shocked to

2194.44 --> 2200.079
find out how bad it actually had gotten

2196.599 --> 2203.5
at school because I didn't tell them

2200.079 --> 2207.2400000000002
I I kept it a secret because I could

2203.5 --> 2207.24
handle it that's how I felt about it

2209.25 --> 2212.38
[Music]

2214.599 --> 2221.8
right and I've had conversations with my

2217.9 --> 2223.9
dad like uh a decade ago plenty where I

2221.8 --> 2225.46
basically explained like the things that

2223.9 --> 2228.119
actually would happen in school and then

2225.46 --> 2235.079
he'd never heard about and he was like

2228.119 --> 2235.079
what what all that oh my God

2235.24 --> 2241.7799999999997
it was shocked for some of the stories

2239.32 --> 2243.94
where I go into more detail than I

2241.78 --> 2245.619
typically do when I talk about things in

2243.94 --> 2248.37
my past over here

2245.619 --> 2249.88
because it's my dad anyway uh

2248.37 --> 2251.8199999999997
[Music]

2249.88 --> 2253.78
I'm getting kind of

2251.82 --> 2257.8
sidetracked here what was I talking

2253.78 --> 2259.7200000000003
about we're cannabis

2257.8 --> 2263.1400000000003
and then morning sickness and then how

2259.72 --> 2265.359
to deal with it in school

2263.14 --> 2267.52
that you have to keep going or you'll be

2265.359 --> 2271.0789999999997
seen as weak yeah I thought that was a

2267.52 --> 2271.079
great maneuver away from cannabis

2272.32 --> 2275.539
[Music]

2278.14 --> 2282.7599999999998
that's all widespread opening yeah yeah

2281.02 --> 2286.619
I think that's weird too because you

2282.76 --> 2286.619
know it's very odd

2293.079 --> 2298.54
right but but they're not doing it

2295.48 --> 2301.96
because they still want to have like a

2298.54 --> 2305.14
a joker card in the back pocket the cops

2301.96 --> 2307.839
do so if they want to easily get rid of

2305.14 --> 2309.7
you they can just say oh cannabis

2307.839 --> 2312.42
even though they might just be smoking

2309.7 --> 2312.4199999999996
there all the time

2312.46 --> 2316.3
yeah

2313.72 --> 2318.72
it's very British though and I'd have to

2316.3 --> 2318.7200000000003
admit

2329.32 --> 2335.619
[Music]

2333.42 --> 2337.48
yeah but are they actually gonna

2335.619 --> 2340.06
Legalize It

2337.48 --> 2341.56
or are they gonna do a similar policy to

2340.06 --> 2343.599
how the Netherlands has been dealing

2341.56 --> 2344.68
with it which is very different from

2343.599 --> 2347.7400000000002
just

2344.68 --> 2351.339
straight out legalization or like a

2347.74 --> 2351.339
condo condolence

2351.66 --> 2355.5
condoning policy

2364.119 --> 2370.119
to still keep it under the radar

2367.0 --> 2373.48
not to be like smoking in the streets

2370.119 --> 2376.38
not to have advertisement about it in

2373.48 --> 2376.38
public situations

2376.54 --> 2382.72
and to not be a bother with it

2380.98 --> 2385.5
on

2382.72 --> 2385.5
other people

2386.56 --> 2390.0
I think it's very sensible

2390.22 --> 2395.74
and there's not a lot of stick stick

2392.44 --> 2397.42
Mata on it either I mean

2395.74 --> 2400.72
people don't

2397.42 --> 2403.48
have as much agitation towards cannabis

2400.72 --> 2405.339
smokers as for example in 90s

2403.48 --> 2408.42
when we would nobody was really used to

2405.339 --> 2408.42
it yet

2408.7 --> 2412.24
it'll still kind of just hit this hip

2410.92 --> 2414.4
thing

2412.24 --> 2416.74
there was more protest and now it's like

2414.4 --> 2418.9
yeah

2416.74 --> 2421.4199999999996
just kind of the smokers they're all

2418.9 --> 2423.7000000000003
right I mean it's better than people

2421.42 --> 2425.02
that drink booze on the street

2423.7 --> 2427.16
you know

2425.02 --> 2430.839
but uh

2427.16 --> 2434.2799999999997
[Music]

2430.839 --> 2434.2799999999997
anyway what's this

2439.66 --> 2444.339
where you

2441.339 --> 2444.339
linking

2449.079 --> 2452.7000000000003
why did you link that

2454.3 --> 2459.3390000000004
what the [ __ ] dude

2457.18 --> 2462.359
why are you shoving that woman in my

2459.339 --> 2462.359
face clearly

2492.46 --> 2495.18
foreign

2496.68 --> 2502.0789999999997
now that that is true

2499.24 --> 2504.7799999999997
big Pharma is supposed to

2502.079 --> 2507.6400000000003
legalization or

2504.78 --> 2509.02
condoning policy concerning cannabis

2507.64 --> 2512.02
because of that

2509.02 --> 2514.45
because of the medicinal properties

2512.02 --> 2515.92
that's right

2514.45 --> 2517.359
[Music]

2515.92 --> 2522.099
so

2517.359 --> 2526.0
make it happen then I mean oh no the the

2522.099 --> 2528.579
mo our most notorious greatest opponent

2526.0 --> 2532.599
Against Humanity ever that has been

2528.579 --> 2536.32
recently revealed is opposed to it oh no

2532.599 --> 2538.599
oh okay well maybe legalize it then

2536.32 --> 2541.7200000000003
I mean

2538.599 --> 2544.3590000000004
you want to make big Pharma

2541.72 --> 2547.2999999999997
get a big setback

2544.359 --> 2550.96
in response to what they just basically

2547.3 --> 2553.0600000000004
did to to have Humanity

2550.96 --> 2555.96
legalize cannabis

2553.06 --> 2555.96
everywhere

2556.06 --> 2561.94
but with sensible policies

2559.839 --> 2563.14
right adapted to the region their

2561.94 --> 2567.119
culture

2563.14 --> 2567.1189999999997
how they would like to have it

2568.06 --> 2573.04
is it not legal in the Netherlands well

2570.28 --> 2576.1600000000003
effectively Professor Phil Bell but

2573.04 --> 2580.319
under specific conditions

2576.16 --> 2580.319
so it's technically not legal

2580.96 --> 2587.14
it's like not legal to have in your

2583.3 --> 2589.3590000000004
possession more than like five grams

2587.14 --> 2592.72
which of course is impossible for coffee

2589.359 --> 2595.0
shop owners because yeah but

2592.72 --> 2597.64
so that's like a bit of a tricky system

2595.0 --> 2601.119
you can grow your own plants but only

2597.64 --> 2603.339
like three or five I don't remember and

2601.119 --> 2606.099
nobody can be

2603.339 --> 2609.099
can be like bothered by it like if there

2606.099 --> 2611.319
is some kind of issue like with the

2609.099 --> 2613.3
smell and people complain about it then

2611.319 --> 2615.4
they might come to your house and

2613.3 --> 2618.04
actually take your plants

2615.4 --> 2621.7000000000003
it like it's weird

2618.04 --> 2625.079
but it does seem to work sort of I don't

2621.7 --> 2629.5
know maybe there's even like room for

2625.079 --> 2631.3
evolving like more evolution of how this

2629.5 --> 2633.16
it works

2631.3 --> 2635.2000000000003
but yeah it's not just straight out

2633.16 --> 2637.0
legal it's not like oh this is just like

2635.2 --> 2639.48
candy now

2637.0 --> 2639.48
nope

2643.839 --> 2648.94
no Clary fed is not coming back to

2646.66 --> 2652.72
Discord

2648.94 --> 2655.2400000000002
and Gillette is working just fine

2652.72 --> 2656.5
it has a bit of update issues here and

2655.24 --> 2659.2
there

2656.5 --> 2661.74
but it's overall working better than

2659.2 --> 2664.839
Discord which is continually

2661.74 --> 2667.74
malfunctioning since the very Foundation

2664.839 --> 2667.74
of it pretty much

2669.56 --> 2680.92
[Music]

2681.579 --> 2685.319
it's a strange system in the Netherlands

2684.04 --> 2689.859
yeah

2685.319 --> 2694.24
but one more clear direct advantage of

2689.859 --> 2697.14
our system is that it's more low profile

2694.24 --> 2697.14
and I like that

2697.9 --> 2703.599
because if it would be more high profile

2700.48 --> 2707.26
you know freaking marxists are

2703.599 --> 2710.619
immediately gonna use it

2707.26 --> 2712.8
to try to wreck everything

2710.619 --> 2712.8
foreign

2714.339 --> 2719.619
California

2717.22 --> 2722.02
I mean legalization also means

2719.619 --> 2724.839
grabbalization

2722.02 --> 2729.579
if you just fully legalize it that means

2724.839 --> 2733.0
Grabbers are open for business no limits

2729.579 --> 2735.3590000000004
until limits are set right that's the

2733.0 --> 2735.359
issue

2736.24 --> 2741.9599999999996
and you know what they do when you give

2738.46 --> 2741.96
them opportunities like that

2743.56 --> 2747.94
now if you just give them proper rules

2746.68 --> 2750.7599999999998
and settings

2747.94 --> 2752.7000000000003
here in the Netherlands well then

2750.76 --> 2756.0400000000004
yeah

2752.7 --> 2760.18
you get awesome coffee shop owners that

2756.04 --> 2763.06
are Jews that are really great people

2760.18 --> 2765.64
but if it was fully legalized here I

2763.06 --> 2768.099
mean this guy might be

2765.64 --> 2769.9
well one of the more Marxist types as

2768.099 --> 2771.6400000000003
like literally trying to make everybody

2769.9 --> 2776.04
go smoke then or something maybe

2771.64 --> 2776.04
probably not but I mean

2776.52 --> 2782.04
complete legalization also means

2779.14 --> 2782.04
grabbalization

2782.319 --> 2786.7
you gotta keep that in mind like that's

2784.359 --> 2789.42
gonna happen with freedom come

2786.7 --> 2789.4199999999996
scrabblers

2794.38 --> 2800.02
yeah text well taxation is another form

2797.619 --> 2802.92
of grappling so yeah

2800.02 --> 2802.92
this is

2825.93 --> 2829.219
[Music]

2832.56 --> 2839.819
[Music]

2837.16 --> 2839.819
uh

2843.7 --> 2847.54
35 damn

2858.099 --> 2862.78
right well the problem is is that

2861.099 --> 2866.1400000000003
paper

2862.78 --> 2868.96
with a tax system on it

2866.14 --> 2871.5989999999997
accompanied with legalization is that

2868.96 --> 2874.3
everything becomes industrialized what

2871.599 --> 2877.3
that will lead to is cannabis

2874.3 --> 2880.9
that is less personally traded

2877.3 --> 2884.319
a more turned into just like a machine

2880.9 --> 2887.2000000000003
and so more THC

2884.319 --> 2889.72
more more more and it just becomes like

2887.2 --> 2891.8799999999997
a a weapon eventually that's what

2889.72 --> 2895.06
happens

2891.88 --> 2897.46
right because they would have to do that

2895.06 --> 2898.839
if there's taxation you have to go out

2897.46 --> 2901.599
the curve you have to be better you have

2898.839 --> 2905.339
to compete there's no taxation

2901.599 --> 2905.339
then there's no push

2905.38 --> 2909.46
to basically do that and that everybody

2907.359 --> 2913.839
can just have their own plans and like

2909.46 --> 2915.88
Tinker with it like a druid on their own

2913.839 --> 2919.18
which is much more what is happening

2915.88 --> 2921.28
over here I mean there's like you get at

2919.18 --> 2923.859
every coffee shop here that I go go to

2921.28 --> 2927.2200000000003
you do have like grower background

2923.859 --> 2928.96
stories it's like oh look our grower

2927.22 --> 2930.9399999999996
tried a combination of this in this

2928.96 --> 2931.9
plant and this is the result what do you

2930.94 --> 2933.099
think

2931.9 --> 2935.079
right

2933.099 --> 2937.119
and it's never like always growing

2935.079 --> 2939.819
stronger and stronger no no no no I mean

2937.119 --> 2942.52
they do offer like oh we also have the

2939.819 --> 2944.92
very super strong some super strong weed

2942.52 --> 2948.7599999999998
imported from California

2944.92 --> 2952.1800000000003
and that [ __ ] is just nasty it's so way

2948.76 --> 2954.2200000000003
too strong and like I never not even

2952.18 --> 2955.72
gonna

2954.22 --> 2958.54
like I

2955.72 --> 2961.72
I tried a little flake of that like once

2958.54 --> 2964.06
and it's like no like this is that's not

2961.72 --> 2966.819
even cannabis and it doesn't even feel

2964.06 --> 2969.42
like it anymore it's just way too

2966.819 --> 2969.42
aggressive

2970.42 --> 2976.42
but yeah that's what people choose

2974.319 --> 2980.22
what

2976.42 --> 2980.2200000000003
hello Bill Johnson which

2984.22 --> 2987.839

3024.78 --> 3027.5600000000004
no

3028.319 --> 3033.8
or there's maybe it's not arrived yet

3031.2 --> 3033.7999999999997
Bill Johnson

3033.96 --> 3041.339
but yeah it's not there I only got my

3037.5 --> 3043.859
two euros and 70 cents from patreon

3041.339 --> 3046.4
thanks to Godzilla that's like my last

3043.859 --> 3046.4
patreon

3051.3 --> 3055.88
yeah well to be fair though I've never

3053.46 --> 3058.38
actually like actively done anything

3055.88 --> 3060.54
with patreon

3058.38 --> 3064.38
because all these things that they like

3060.54 --> 3068.04
want you to basically offer in there

3064.38 --> 3069.96
I've never actually done any of that

3068.04 --> 3073.099
maybe that's why I'm not very popular

3069.96 --> 3073.099
through patreon

3074.04 --> 3076.94
anyways

3091.079 --> 3100.88
okay I think Bill Johnson is a a troll

3095.76 --> 3100.88
lying scumbag who's banned

3114.38 --> 3124.449
all right

3116.68 --> 3124.4489999999996
[Music]

3129.96 --> 3134.059
ah yeah Tony Whitcomb I remember that

3147.18 --> 3151.68
foreign

3148.64 --> 3154.5589999999997
fibroids yeah now what from that weird

3151.68 --> 3157.9199999999996
Californian weed is what I call it

3154.559 --> 3160.7400000000002
like it didn't even smell like cannabis

3157.92 --> 3163.7400000000002
it's like

3160.74 --> 3166.9199999999996
sort of like cannabis adjacent but it

3163.74 --> 3169.9199999999996
just didn't smell like cannabis

3166.92 --> 3169.92
weird

3172.51 --> 3181.63
[Music]

3186.72 --> 3191.27
I love a good bad hammer in the morning

3188.819 --> 3194.389
it's just

3191.27 --> 3194.389
[Music]

3196.619 --> 3201.92
all right so I already banned Scott for

3199.38 --> 3201.92
being a dick

3202.02 --> 3204.2599999999998
foreign

3206.76 --> 3212.3590000000004
oh God that reminds me of that South

3209.04 --> 3212.359
Park episode with Scott

3213.42 --> 3217.579
Scott was being a dick there too

3232.14 --> 3237.72
it's what you imagine no don't try to

3235.5 --> 3240.98
imagine that fiber outs don't think

3237.72 --> 3240.98
about such things at all

3246.72 --> 3252.359
just realize that and this is something

3249.119 --> 3256.8
that I learned very early on

3252.359 --> 3259.319
is that most drugs or drugs

3256.8 --> 3261.54
all you're doing is just forcing a very

3259.319 --> 3264.599
specific part of your body

3261.54 --> 3268.7599999999998
your brain to squirt

3264.599 --> 3268.76
that really is it every time

3269.04 --> 3275.48
right except I guess we're super excited

3272.28 --> 3279.98
stuff like cocaine

3275.48 --> 3279.98
it's mostly just squirt so

3280.44 --> 3286.2000000000003
if you don't do it

3283.14 --> 3289.0789999999997
you don't get addicted to the ultimate

3286.2 --> 3292.02
score then you may still have a little

3289.079 --> 3295.44
squirts the rest of your life and just

3292.02 --> 3297.119
enjoy it in moderation directed by

3295.44 --> 3299.579
Nature

3297.119 --> 3302.04
yeah I mean

3299.579 --> 3305.6400000000003
I've had moments where I'm like in love

3302.04 --> 3308.7599999999998
with a girl and [ __ ] that I'm very

3305.64 --> 3311.24
certain that that is exactly what heroin

3308.76 --> 3313.7400000000002
feels like

3311.24 --> 3315.8999999999996
so incredible

3313.74 --> 3319.2
the feeling that's like this must be

3315.9 --> 3323.28
what heroin is like except

3319.2 --> 3325.98
I can relive that sort of first moment

3323.28 --> 3329.8190000000004
time and time again because once you

3325.98 --> 3331.26
take the real thing then you never get

3329.819 --> 3332.2799999999997
that moment back

3331.26 --> 3335.6400000000003
yeah

3332.28 --> 3337.88
I've had to learn this the smart way not

3335.64 --> 3340.319
the hard way

3337.88 --> 3343.4
because I learned it from people that

3340.319 --> 3343.4
had made that mistake

3343.74 --> 3348.5989999999997
foreign

3345.74 --> 3352.319
happy that I never

3348.599 --> 3356.78
like went beyond cannabis and alcohol so

3352.319 --> 3356.7799999999997
ready the handful by itself

3356.84 --> 3360.03
[Music]

3362.8 --> 3368.0190000000002
[Music]

3372.1 --> 3376.6189999999997
[Music]

3378.0 --> 3383.18
oh

3379.559 --> 3383.1800000000003
okay PJ grishank

3383.7 --> 3388.819
oh yeah I'm not playing any judgment

3389.46 --> 3393.2400000000002
I mean everybody goes through things in

3391.92 --> 3396.44
their lives and

3393.24 --> 3396.4399999999996
learn to deal with it

3398.94 --> 3402.02
for whatever reason

3414.359 --> 3420.5989999999997
yeah if you just seen that I agree the

3416.88 --> 3423.559
Elko is technically

3420.599 --> 3423.559
dangerous

3424.319 --> 3430.38
because of the

3426.319 --> 3431.579
let me call that the cumulative effects

3430.38 --> 3434.099
it just

3431.579 --> 3436.8590000000004
keeps getting worse the more you take it

3434.099 --> 3438.0
and then typical thing is that at some

3436.859 --> 3440.0989999999997
point

3438.0 --> 3442.319
weird things start to happen you start

3440.099 --> 3444.48
to have weird aberrant Behavior or

3442.319 --> 3446.4
possessed Behavior some people would

3444.48 --> 3448.619
even regard that as

3446.4 --> 3450.119
that you probably never remember that

3448.619 --> 3453.48
are totally out of character for you so

3450.119 --> 3456.48
you don't even associate that with you

3453.48 --> 3456.48
afterward

3456.66 --> 3459.5
and

3465.599 --> 3472.02
the combination with that alcohol also

3468.359 --> 3474.5989999999997
typically allows aggression it unleashes

3472.02 --> 3477.66
the tendon the more being more impulsive

3474.599 --> 3480.119
including aggression that is dangerous

3477.66 --> 3481.859
about it cannabis typically doesn't do

3480.119 --> 3483.96
that I mean it might make you paranoid

3481.859 --> 3489.0
it might make you hysterical

3483.96 --> 3492.059
or super emotional but very rarely

3489.0 --> 3495.98
have I seen actual aggression come

3492.059 --> 3495.98
in a response to cannabism

3496.5 --> 3500.72
so

3498.0 --> 3500.72
big difference

3502.89 --> 3506.08
[Music]

3514.44 --> 3518.76
I mean the worst that I've typically

3516.599 --> 3520.619
seen come out of cannabis

3518.76 --> 3524.099
is by women

3520.619 --> 3526.319
that then get dramatic and start to like

3524.099 --> 3528.78
try to slap

3526.319 --> 3530.819
their boyfriend or whatever

3528.78 --> 3532.1400000000003
in the hopes that they'll be a strong

3530.819 --> 3533.7599999999998
man and like

3532.14 --> 3536.54
contain them

3533.76 --> 3539.8190000000004
that sort of thing

3536.54 --> 3541.14
so real aggression that's like actually

3539.819 --> 3542.83
like

3541.14 --> 3545.16
dangerous no

3542.83 --> 3547.44
[Music]

3545.16 --> 3551.16
but maybe there are some guys out there

3547.44 --> 3553.98
that just go completely psychotic

3551.16 --> 3555.48
but then it's they already have that

3553.98 --> 3558.48
tendency

3555.48 --> 3560.16
to just go out of control and aggressive

3558.48 --> 3561.66
all of a sudden and then cannabis will

3560.16 --> 3563.8799999999997
only aggravate them

3561.66 --> 3565.98
right so

3563.88 --> 3569.07
yeah

3565.98 --> 3569.07
[Music]

3572.16 --> 3578.5789999999997
I mean people that have a general

3574.98 --> 3581.4
problem with self-containment like

3578.579 --> 3583.44
controlling your own behavior people

3581.4 --> 3585.54
that are overly impulsive I mean

3583.44 --> 3588.96
everybody being impulsive is pretty cool

3585.54 --> 3592.74
but when you have absolutely no say

3588.96 --> 3595.98
over your impulses that can be lead to

3592.74 --> 3598.319
very unpleasant situations and for those

3595.98 --> 3601.02
types of people cannabis

3598.319 --> 3603.9
can either be a blessing because it

3601.02 --> 3608.839
really calms them down or

3603.9 --> 3608.839
it can make them go like psychotic

3611.16 --> 3615.7799999999997
and it might start out being really calm

3613.5 --> 3620.28
and then eventually lose that come and

3615.78 --> 3625.579
then become psychotic too so yeah

3620.28 --> 3625.579
for typically impulsive people I'd say

3626.4 --> 3632.339
nah

3628.619 --> 3634.98
now for introvert people cannabis

3632.339 --> 3637.5589999999997
I think actually can be like a an

3634.98 --> 3639.18
unlocking system it was for me you have

3637.559 --> 3642.1800000000003
to realize that this might sound really

3639.18 --> 3643.3799999999997
bizarre to you seeing as how expressive

3642.18 --> 3646.6189999999997
I am

3643.38 --> 3649.6400000000003
but I used to be very introvert

3646.619 --> 3649.6400000000003
keeping it in

3650.28 --> 3654.96
right with the issues that come with

3652.68 --> 3658.2799999999997
that it's like another spiritual

3654.96 --> 3660.839
personal approach and it worked great

3658.28 --> 3661.98
but then eventually it didn't work

3660.839 --> 3663.7799999999997
anymore

3661.98 --> 3667.619
and cannabis

3663.78 --> 3670.619
first trying it when I was 15. kind of

3667.619 --> 3673.26
felt like it was unlocking me because

3670.619 --> 3675.78
when I first saw cannabis all of a

3673.26 --> 3679.7400000000002
sudden I could have a meaningful deep

3675.78 --> 3682.6800000000003
conversation for a very long time

3679.74 --> 3686.16
that I like never had

3682.68 --> 3688.68
to that level before like ever not even

3686.16 --> 3692.16
with my parents I would never reach that

3688.68 --> 3694.3799999999997
far so it like kind of unlocked my

3692.16 --> 3697.7599999999998
extrovert side

3694.38 --> 3697.76
quite actively

3703.619 --> 3709.1400000000003
but if you're naturally if like as a kid

3706.74 --> 3712.2599999999998
naturally you're extrovert

3709.14 --> 3714.54
then I'd say probably just want to stay

3712.26 --> 3717.119
away from cannabis

3714.54 --> 3719.94
don't need it

3717.119 --> 3722.52
unless it's like for glaucoma or for

3719.94 --> 3726.119
just yeah CBD oil then or something

3722.52 --> 3728.7
right but don't go be a cannabis smoker

3726.119 --> 3730.75
for the high because it's probably not

3728.7 --> 3733.9689999999996
too great for you

3730.75 --> 3733.969
[Music]

3751.619 --> 3757.7000000000003
huh oh wow Tony with come okay yeah that

3754.44 --> 3757.7000000000003
that is very disciplined

3768.359 --> 3773.0989999999997
right is very valuable when you're an

3771.059 --> 3774.96
alcohol Drinker that you absolutely know

3773.099 --> 3777.1800000000003
when you had enough and that that you

3774.96 --> 3779.46
take that knowledge serious in that

3777.18 --> 3781.5
moment and don't say like uh

3779.46 --> 3783.839
just a little more

3781.5 --> 3786.42
so that's great if you have that

3783.839 --> 3788.839
and you can hold on to that

3786.42 --> 3788.839
anyway

3789.49 --> 3793.8599999999997
[Music]

3798.119 --> 3802.1600000000003
what are you talking about

3802.84 --> 3807.42
[Music]

3812.579 --> 3816.78
yeah

3813.78 --> 3819.5400000000004
well I think I've I might have had like

3816.78 --> 3823.8190000000004
sort of opioid

3819.54 --> 3823.819
type things at some point

3824.88 --> 3830.7000000000003
or was it just morphine or something

3826.859 --> 3833.359
during operation I don't remember

3830.7 --> 3833.359
but

3833.94 --> 3839.64
like to me

3836.64 --> 3841.15
I've always been like genuinely scared

3839.64 --> 3844.02
of opioids

3841.15 --> 3847.5
[Music]

3844.02 --> 3850.559
because I I must have tried it at some

3847.5 --> 3852.599
point I tried it like gotten it by my

3850.559 --> 3853.6400000000003
parents as a kid during an operation or

3852.599 --> 3858.2400000000002
something

3853.64 --> 3861.299
and I just remember that it felt like

3858.24 --> 3864.24
really bad

3861.299 --> 3866.4
like that the physical pain would be

3864.24 --> 3868.859
kind of dissolved but then

3866.4 --> 3872.2200000000003
the the actual

3868.859 --> 3876.42
internal feeling world would get like

3872.22 --> 3878.3999999999996
this weird creepy layer on top of it and

3876.42 --> 3880.339
that it felt like there were beings

3878.4 --> 3883.619
there

3880.339 --> 3886.14
it did not feel safe it's like that

3883.619 --> 3889.1400000000003
sense of it's not safe

3886.14 --> 3892.319
here a spiritual sense

3889.14 --> 3894.12
that went off is like I'm never gonna go

3892.319 --> 3900.989
there

3894.12 --> 3900.989
[Music]

3904.02 --> 3907.96
[Music]

3917.819 --> 3921.7799999999997
I only ever take one I know and well

3919.92 --> 3924.38
five roads I don't take any pain

3921.78 --> 3924.38
medication

3928.92 --> 3934.559
the weird thing is is that if I'm in

3931.559 --> 3937.4
pain I can actually like activate my own

3934.559 --> 3937.4
pain medication

3940.98 --> 3946.859
it's kind of what happened

3944.04 --> 3948.42
like this yeah the night before

3946.859 --> 3950.46
yesterday

3948.42 --> 3952.38
when I was like getting these weird

3950.46 --> 3955.5
sweat attacks and [ __ ] well that's

3952.38 --> 3957.299
really miserable but then

3955.5 --> 3959.339
yeah

3957.299 --> 3962.099
after after it had reached a certain

3959.339 --> 3965.099
threshold I can just switch it on and

3962.099 --> 3967.7400000000002
then it's just like oh

3965.099 --> 3970.079
a calm blanket comes comes over you and

3967.74 --> 3972.0589999999997
it's just like oh what a relief

3970.079 --> 3974.4
and then eventually that stops again and

3972.059 --> 3976.1400000000003
comes back but I could just do that

3974.4 --> 3978.119
periodically

3976.14 --> 3979.92
and that way get through the night and

3978.119 --> 3982.619
in those very short moments you do get

3979.92 --> 3984.359
like real deep rest so

3982.619 --> 3987.839
and then you kind of wake up and be a

3984.359 --> 3990.66
bit miserable again but it works and I

3987.839 --> 3994.38
don't have to take anything

3990.66 --> 3997.16
not even an aspirin or a paracetamol

3994.38 --> 3997.1600000000003
nothing

4000.02 --> 4002.5
uh

4008.059 --> 4013.1800000000003
have you ever had this experience what

4010.819 --> 4013.18
do you mean

4014.74 --> 4018.93
[Music]

4030.92 --> 4036.859
so you mean just moments where suddenly

4033.44 --> 4038.7200000000003
you feel like you're sort of halfway in

4036.859 --> 4040.46
another dimension and the being of light

4038.72 --> 4044.0
comes towards you

4040.46 --> 4046.359
to I don't know remind you of something

4044.0 --> 4049.579
is that what you're talking about

4046.359 --> 4052.0
non-medication related

4049.579 --> 4054.079
we had it during the painting okay

4052.0 --> 4055.339
non-medication related

4054.079 --> 4059.5
yeah

4055.339 --> 4059.5
I've had a lot of those moments

4059.599 --> 4066.099
and yes it is extremely humbling and

4062.119 --> 4066.099
emotion like emotion inducing

4070.22 --> 4078.14
I've had that several times I dude I met

4074.599 --> 4080.7200000000003
Buddha that way when I was like 17

4078.14 --> 4084.5589999999997
where I was just sitting in my chair

4080.72 --> 4086.66
chilling and then suddenly like

4084.559 --> 4089.9
literally with my eyes open everything

4086.66 --> 4092.1189999999997
was just white it's like sadly I'm

4089.9 --> 4093.6800000000003
seeing only white

4092.119 --> 4096.14
and I was like what's going on ah

4093.68 --> 4097.639999999999
where's my sight why can't I see things

4096.14 --> 4101.06
around me anymore it's just white

4097.64 --> 4104.0
blinding white and then suddenly

4101.06 --> 4105.7390000000005
a face like suddenly instead of just

4104.0 --> 4107.48
being white it was it turned out to be

4105.739 --> 4110.0
more like a milk

4107.48 --> 4111.919999999999
white sheet or something and then the

4110.0 --> 4114.5
face of Buddha just started to like

4111.92 --> 4116.779
appear out of it and the entire Buddha

4114.5 --> 4120.1
like right in front of me just like a

4116.779 --> 4120.1
statue just coming forward

4120.859 --> 4126.88
and I realized like whoa

4123.62 --> 4126.88
this is heavy

4132.92 --> 4136.64
and

4134.66 --> 4139.04
in the shower

4136.64 --> 4143.4400000000005
well I've had weird that's yeah those

4139.04 --> 4143.44
types of things yeah I've had that a lot

4157.58 --> 4161.719
you can see yeah you see with your inner

4160.699 --> 4164.419999999999
eye

4161.719 --> 4166.58
it's basically it's probably pineal

4164.42 --> 4168.9800000000005
gland related so you probably your

4166.58 --> 4170.839
pineal gland got activated and gave you

4168.98 --> 4173.0599999999995
a second sight

4170.839 --> 4175.8189999999995
that's the spirit side it's a that's

4173.06 --> 4179.080000000001
also where the Dark World Vision is

4175.819 --> 4179.080000000001
generated from

4179.359 --> 4182.4800000000005
okay this is happening to me well that

4181.1 --> 4185.92
means your pineal gland is getting

4182.48 --> 4185.919999999999
activated for some reason

4195.02 --> 4199.9400000000005
well maybe all the talk has kind of

4197.719 --> 4203.0
triggered it I mean I am talking about

4199.94 --> 4205.9
drugs and what it does to you and so

4203.0 --> 4208.28
maybe that kind of

4205.9 --> 4213.4
psychosomatically triggered it

4208.28 --> 4213.4
and you're now it's like yeah here I am

4216.58 --> 4222.5
getting out of control okay well if it's

4219.44 --> 4223.94
getting out of control then just take it

4222.5 --> 4226.52
easy

4223.94 --> 4228.739
don't get over enthusiastic don't get

4226.52 --> 4230.780000000001
over excited

4228.739 --> 4233.259999999999
Just Breathe

4230.78 --> 4236.0
get some fresh air if all possible

4233.26 --> 4239.1990000000005
absorb some sunlight

4236.0 --> 4239.199
that helps a lot

4241.52 --> 4246.580000000001
maybe yeah get a a drink of water

4246.86 --> 4250.699
don't don't do tea

4248.84 --> 4253.6990000000005
like when that's activated you don't

4250.699 --> 4258.219
want to have any excitotoxins of any

4253.699 --> 4258.219
sort just one pure stuff

4258.62 --> 4265.49
to know tea or coffee

4259.99 --> 4265.49
[Music]

4268.8 --> 4272.02
[Music]

4274.46 --> 4279.4
[Music]

4276.739 --> 4279.4
all right

4283.76 --> 4289.1
yeah did you seen it that's right some

4286.4 --> 4291.08
drugs commonly open people or cannabis

4289.1 --> 4294.820000000001
opened up my

4291.08 --> 4297.92
social communication skills

4294.82 --> 4299.599999999999
like literally from one moment to the

4297.92 --> 4302.92
other

4299.6 --> 4302.92
and it stayed open

4316.34 --> 4323.32
I wonder if you guys explain similar

4318.38 --> 4323.32
things yeah yes I have five roads

4325.48 --> 4333.199
I mean

4327.98 --> 4333.199
well the night before yesterday

4333.52 --> 4340.34
I had a very ex like almost dark World

4338.54 --> 4342.739
Vision

4340.34 --> 4344.78
type and it's weird because it kind of

4342.739 --> 4347.659
synchronized with those

4344.78 --> 4351.259999999999
moments it's like the whole thing

4347.659 --> 4356.799999999999
getting activated it did something extra

4351.26 --> 4356.8
and I did like I think I saw Aslan there

4356.84 --> 4361.96
I tried to hug him I don't remember if I

4359.42 --> 4361.96
succeeded

4363.26 --> 4370.360000000001
but I guess that it's also because that

4366.14 --> 4370.360000000001
movie was just freshly imprinted on me

4380.12 --> 4384.5199999999995
what are we discussing today oh God

4384.76 --> 4391.88
drugs so it seems

4388.76 --> 4394.219
and fiber oats is tripping

4391.88 --> 4397.400000000001
currently a little bit of vision

4394.219 --> 4400.94
activity so it seems

4397.4 --> 4402.5
so yeah a lot of psychedelic experiences

4400.94 --> 4406.48
and

4402.5 --> 4406.48
how do you balance things out

4421.159 --> 4427.839999999999
yeah and I appreciate you two five roads

4424.64 --> 4427.84
I mean yeah

4428.719 --> 4434.4800000000005
it's good to have that

4431.06 --> 4437.719
ability to just have people

4434.48 --> 4438.919999999999
to do to go there

4437.719 --> 4440.96
with

4438.92 --> 4444.159
right

4440.96 --> 4444.159
at your own pace

4444.199 --> 4451.4
you don't have to like travel hours or

4448.58 --> 4453.92
spend money to do it you just have to go

4451.4 --> 4455.42
online and be there at the time when

4453.92 --> 4458.649
it's there

4455.42 --> 4458.649
[Music]

4463.84 --> 4470.12
if you've seen ass laughs

4466.94 --> 4471.5599999999995
then you must have seen Simon Ben as he

4470.12 --> 4474.04
lives in Narnia that is freaking

4471.56 --> 4474.04
hilarious

4479.12 --> 4484.4
but you know what is weirder Tony

4481.28 --> 4486.44
Whitcomb some and then this gets really

4484.4 --> 4488.239
trippy

4486.44 --> 4492.379999999999
I think that

4488.239 --> 4495.139999999999
I actually had very extensive

4492.38 --> 4496.88
it's very serious conversations with

4495.14 --> 4501.62
Aslan

4496.88 --> 4504.4400000000005
in my main Vision when I was 17

4501.62 --> 4508.04
and I'd never even heard

4504.44 --> 4509.299999999999
of Aslan or Narnia or anything about

4508.04 --> 4513.5
that yet

4509.3 --> 4516.92
and in 2017 I got to basically see

4513.5 --> 4519.14
the Aslan of The Chronicles of Narnia

4516.92 --> 4523.9
movie

4519.14 --> 4523.900000000001
as a representative of some kind

4525.08 --> 4531.62
and it's like at least altogether 15

4528.739 --> 4533.9
minutes of intense conversation

4531.62 --> 4536.12
and I think that I actually kind of

4533.9 --> 4538.099999999999
didn't like him at the end of it

4536.12 --> 4540.739
is really weird I don't even remember

4538.1 --> 4542.900000000001
exactly it must have had something to do

4540.739 --> 4545.12
with basically my vision quest my

4542.9 --> 4546.98
missions like I have to go there and

4545.12 --> 4549.26
Aslan was just being

4546.98 --> 4551.599999999999
like too much like no you just have to

4549.26 --> 4553.52
trust how it works and it was just being

4551.6 --> 4557.14
being too Christ

4553.52 --> 4557.14
and it was annoying me

4560.9 --> 4565.699
it's so weird like I've had that

4563.42 --> 4569.06
conversation when I was 17 and I didn't

4565.699 --> 4572.419999999999
even know what that was

4569.06 --> 4576.26
foreign so what I experienced yesterday

4572.42 --> 4578.06
might be a re-simulation or a tapping in

4576.26 --> 4580.280000000001
partially where I suddenly got a little

4578.06 --> 4584.92
Glimpse back of the actual experience

4580.28 --> 4584.92
but this time from another perspective

4585.02 --> 4590.5
it did kind of feel like there was

4587.12 --> 4590.5
another me there present

4590.96 --> 4594.9800000000005
and I'm talking about the night before

4593.06 --> 4598.04
yesterday

4594.98 --> 4600.919999999999
because I literally did see like a

4598.04 --> 4604.28
full-on glimpse and then just like a

4600.92 --> 4608.1990000000005
blue sky and then like green field and

4604.28 --> 4608.199
Forest in Iceland was standing there

4609.08 --> 4613.0
and other people

4613.82 --> 4619.099999999999
some of which were very nondescript and

4616.52 --> 4621.9800000000005
unrecognizable almost blurred out but

4619.1 --> 4627.219
one figure was recognizable

4621.98 --> 4627.218999999999
and it was wearing a black leather coat

4633.38 --> 4638.179
weird stuff

4636.08 --> 4639.62
but that happens and it happened even

4638.179 --> 4641.78
during the vision

4639.62 --> 4645.5599999999995
because you have to remember that that

4641.78 --> 4649.34
Vision thing was a a non-time bound

4645.56 --> 4651.7390000000005
experience 80 years within a singular

4649.34 --> 4654.56
moment and

4651.739 --> 4656.239
I Met Myself there in several phases and

4654.56 --> 4658.280000000001
I think that I had just another little

4656.239 --> 4660.0199999999995
glimpse

4658.28 --> 4662.78
except that

4660.02 --> 4666.080000000001
that's really funny by the way I think

4662.78 --> 4668.36
that even in that Vision I did recognize

4666.08 --> 4672.62
that there was another me there

4668.36 --> 4674.659
and I completely ignored him

4672.62 --> 4676.94
so even in that Vision I might have been

4674.659 --> 4679.04
aware that with that conversation with

4676.94 --> 4681.0199999999995
Aslan that there was another me standing

4679.04 --> 4684.62
there I think he was even actually

4681.02 --> 4686.4800000000005
trying to help like make me connect and

4684.62 --> 4687.86
I just refused I'm like no I'm right

4686.48 --> 4689.718999999999
here right now

4687.86 --> 4691.099999999999
anybody that wants to get something out

4689.719 --> 4693.679
of it I'm gonna have to do that on their

4691.1 --> 4696.34
own I'm too focused

4693.679 --> 4696.34
on this

4696.38 --> 4699.9400000000005
this is getting really trippy

4702.8 --> 4706.360000000001
so yeah another connection

4706.699 --> 4708.879999999999
thank you

4717.49 --> 4720.76
[Music]

4721.34 --> 4727.28
anyway hope you guys are still there not

4724.159 --> 4729.5599999999995
falling asleep by now

4727.28 --> 4730.699
or fallen into some kind of a dream

4729.56 --> 4734.8
state

4730.699 --> 4734.799999999999
maybe a tricked a whole bunch of visions

4735.199 --> 4739.94
and I'll have to

4737.44 --> 4743.44
reporting and what happened in the last

4739.94 --> 4743.44
20 years of your experience

4744.14 --> 4751.439
or not

4744.94 --> 4751.438999999999
[Music]

4761.78 --> 4764.92
you know what's weird

4768.62 --> 4773.84
the more I connect up with these types

4771.32 --> 4775.82
of experience through the Dark World in

4773.84 --> 4777.9800000000005
that Timeless moment and meeting myself

4775.82 --> 4780.759999999999
in several versions I'm starting to

4777.98 --> 4780.759999999999
realize that

4785.42 --> 4793.28
when I was 17 I had very little respect

4790.48 --> 4796.4
for my Elder self

4793.28 --> 4798.5
I hated him

4796.4 --> 4802.339999999999
maybe it's because I hated that I would

4798.5 --> 4803.3
become older and less strong or so I

4802.34 --> 4805.12
thought

4803.3 --> 4807.860000000001
because I

4805.12 --> 4809.659
underestimated the power of wisdom even

4807.86 --> 4811.94
though I was leaning on it and and

4809.659 --> 4813.42
actually like I underestimated but I was

4811.94 --> 4816.648999999999
still trusting it

4813.42 --> 4816.649
[Music]

4818.84 --> 4824.54
but then every time

4821.54 --> 4827.06
one version of me met another version

4824.54 --> 4829.46
from another time the younger one would

4827.06 --> 4830.6
always be more resentful to the other

4829.46 --> 4833.62
one

4830.6 --> 4833.620000000001
like I hate you

4839.84 --> 4843.52
what an odd realization

4851.83 --> 4854.96
[Music]

4855.44 --> 4858.099999999999
oh

4862.0 --> 4865.21
[Music]

4867.14 --> 4870.9800000000005
and it's kind of weird because in

4869.06 --> 4874.900000000001
retrospect I wish I was a little bit

4870.98 --> 4874.9
more tolerable towards myself

4876.62 --> 4879.5199999999995
I think to say

4884.0 --> 4888.02
but

4885.38 --> 4890.719
I couldn't be

4888.02 --> 4893.6
I couldn't do it I was too locked in I

4890.719 --> 4896.12
was like no everything is now

4893.6 --> 4898.280000000001
it my older self doesn't matter I

4896.12 --> 4902.48
totally underestimated how that worked

4898.28 --> 4906.0199999999995
and I scoffed at myself so many times

4902.48 --> 4909.199
but I was locked in I like

4906.02 --> 4913.0
there was nothing else I could do

4909.199 --> 4913.0
to retain the cohesion

4913.58 --> 4920.36
or maybe I was too afraid to let go of

4917.239 --> 4922.879999999999
some of that cohesion maybe that was

4920.36 --> 4926.599999999999
really the problem

4922.88 --> 4929.719
that I just refuse to let go and kind of

4926.6 --> 4932.1990000000005
merge with whatever reality would be

4929.719 --> 4932.199
presenting

4933.08 --> 4939.38
there was too self-focused maybe

4936.62 --> 4942.0199999999995
in the now

4939.38 --> 4945.38
within a Timeless experience by the way

4942.02 --> 4949.179
so it's like really bizarre

4945.38 --> 4949.179
and kind of complicated

4953.3 --> 4958.2390000000005
but I am starting to imagine like what

4955.46 --> 4962.8
if I had managed to actually connect up

4958.239 --> 4966.139999999999
would have had a much better

4962.8 --> 4968.360000000001
internal relationship with myself

4966.14 --> 4970.76
would I be less Restless less

4968.36 --> 4973.82
self-punishing

4970.76 --> 4977.02
if I had managed to do it correctly and

4973.82 --> 4977.0199999999995
just connect up just

4986.6 --> 4992.0
did my younger self see my older self as

4989.96 --> 4995.9800000000005
a social media creator

4992.0 --> 4995.98
I think he despised that

5001.06 --> 5003.96
but no

5005.32 --> 5011.0199999999995
I always thought that I would be a

5007.3 --> 5013.0
speaker or like a religious figure

5011.02 --> 5016.38
and I kind of assumed that it would be

5013.0 --> 5016.38
politics or something

5017.199 --> 5021.58
or church

5019.42 --> 5024.46
something

5021.58 --> 5027.219
but I never figured out

5024.46 --> 5029.92
until pretty much I was right there well

5027.219 --> 5032.7390000000005
no it's not fair no I started to figure

5029.92 --> 5035.14
it out like in 2008 basically seeing

5032.739 --> 5038.199
Alex Jones like oh [ __ ]

5035.14 --> 5040.900000000001
this is something that you could do and

5038.199 --> 5044.219
like really really do

5040.9 --> 5044.219
I have that in me

5044.32 --> 5049.659
and back then I I wasn't very sure about

5046.6 --> 5053.88
that very uncertain very

5049.659 --> 5053.879999999999
not strong not strong enough yet

5055.84 --> 5061.54
but yeah being much younger and

5058.36 --> 5064.42
especially during division no I did not

5061.54 --> 5067.62
see myself as a social media figure I

5064.42 --> 5067.62
thought I was just

5067.84 --> 5073.84
just a standard guy like everybody would

5070.9 --> 5076.78
have a journal like everybody would talk

5073.84 --> 5079.0
an hour online I thought that I thought

5076.78 --> 5080.199
that that was normal I didn't even see

5079.0 --> 5083.44
that it was

5080.199 --> 5085.299999999999
not exactly normal to do that

5083.44 --> 5087.159
because I did actually kind of watch

5085.3 --> 5090.3
back all my shows

5087.159 --> 5090.299999999999
from beginning to end

5090.46 --> 5095.56
Non-Stop

5093.0 --> 5099.06
which is something you can actually do

5095.56 --> 5099.06
in the Timeless world without

5099.58 --> 5106.179
because in the linear time-bound world

5101.739 --> 5108.9
that is way too much to go to doing one

5106.179 --> 5108.9
conscious go

5122.199 --> 5128.919999999999
but no I never really saw it as like

5125.62 --> 5131.32
oh this is your profession Arwen

5128.92 --> 5133.9
I never really saw it like that even in

5131.32 --> 5136.299999999999
my Visions maybe I even like refused to

5133.9 --> 5138.46
recognize it maybe I was just kind of

5136.3 --> 5142.0
bitter

5138.46 --> 5143.56
that the future for me would not be more

5142.0 --> 5145.48
glorious

5143.56 --> 5149.320000000001
more prominent

5145.48 --> 5151.599999999999
more publicly respected

5149.32 --> 5154.199
like in an overt way and not in an

5151.6 --> 5154.1990000000005
internal way

5154.54 --> 5160.96
but yeah I guess I was 17 I mean

5158.5 --> 5166.0
much younger spirit

5160.96 --> 5166.0
much more inflamed much grandioser

5170.98 --> 5177.879999999999
I see Chinese food

5174.52 --> 5179.56
yeah those those imagery that's weird to

5177.88 --> 5180.89
anyway I agree

5179.56 --> 5184.079000000001
anyway

5180.89 --> 5184.079000000001
[Music]

5189.76 --> 5196.02
I hope you are all enjoying the show

5191.58 --> 5199.0
some just being very

5196.02 --> 5201.040000000001
esoteric and internal among my Timeless

5199.0 --> 5203.44
experience I mean

5201.04 --> 5205.78
I hope that people are starting to catch

5203.44 --> 5208.78
on or even from the outside that when I

5205.78 --> 5211.259999999999
reference that [ __ ] it's not something I

5208.78 --> 5211.259999999999
made up

5214.179 --> 5219.6990000000005
I mean not consciously anyway it's

5217.06 --> 5222.1
something that really happened to me

5219.699 --> 5224.5599999999995
it's pretty extraordinary and you feel

5222.1 --> 5226.900000000001
very I do feel special for having

5224.56 --> 5229.120000000001
experienced that

5226.9 --> 5232.42
even though

5229.12 --> 5233.639
it's been very tough to actually find

5232.42 --> 5238.02
some kind of

5233.639 --> 5238.02
pragmatic use for it

5238.42 --> 5243.96
that is like provable in the in the more

5241.179 --> 5243.96
material world

5244.42 --> 5249.34
but what I can say that it has

5246.659 --> 5251.259999999999
accomplished is that it gave me so much

5249.34 --> 5254.56
to reflect upon that it is basically

5251.26 --> 5257.58
refined my perception skills and my

5254.56 --> 5257.580000000001
analytical skills

5257.8 --> 5264.2390000000005
so if anything at least it has provided

5261.1 --> 5264.2390000000005
an upgrade in that

5267.159 --> 5271.179
but yeah there will always be people out

5269.62 --> 5272.98
there that will hear me talk about it

5271.179 --> 5274.9
and just be like what the hell is he

5272.98 --> 5276.94
talking about

5274.9 --> 5278.799999999999
that have never had anything like that

5276.94 --> 5282.58
as an experience and that might never

5278.8 --> 5284.9800000000005
have them I don't know even like how the

5282.58 --> 5286.96
pineal gland works with everybody

5284.98 --> 5289.78
I know how it works with me and I know

5286.96 --> 5292.12
there's other people with who they have

5289.78 --> 5294.82
very similar experience right

5292.12 --> 5296.62
but there's people with who it just

5294.82 --> 5298.48
never goes on

5296.62 --> 5301.719
or

5298.48 --> 5304.239
very rarely and then when it does it's a

5301.719 --> 5307.78
total nightmare and they have absolutely

5304.239 --> 5310.48
no control it's just a nightmare

5307.78 --> 5312.46
and those people become very scared of

5310.48 --> 5313.78
that sort of thing they get scared of

5312.46 --> 5316.54
being

5313.78 --> 5320.08
psionically triggered because it's too

5316.54 --> 5322.32
wild to them they it's only only bad and

5320.08 --> 5322.32
scary

5325.0 --> 5329.199
and eventually those types of people

5326.86 --> 5331.0
learn the discipline to completely lock

5329.199 --> 5333.94
it off so that it just never gets

5331.0 --> 5336.46
triggered so they never destabilize they

5333.94 --> 5340.199
those people do not learn how to use it

5336.46 --> 5340.199
they only learn how to close it off

5340.54 --> 5347.04
I've very much actively learned how to

5344.62 --> 5347.04
use it

5350.62 --> 5354.179
starting at a pretty young age

5356.199 --> 5360.21
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

5358.06 --> 5363.369000000001

5607.679 --> 5613.84
determining your skill range in your

5610.54 --> 5617.1
life your lazy piece of [ __ ]

5613.84 --> 5619.900000000001
so don't you [ __ ] dare start to grab

5617.1 --> 5622.3
pharmaceutical medication because oh

5619.9 --> 5624.46
it's so bad for me now this is the

5622.3 --> 5627.219
moment where you actually needs to face

5624.46 --> 5629.86
your demons yeah why do you think they

5627.219 --> 5631.719
come during your teens why do teens

5629.86 --> 5635.099999999999
suddenly start to feel miserable it's

5631.719 --> 5638.679
called confrontation from the inside

ripening the challenge you now face the

5638.679 --> 5645.88
rest of your life deal with it don't go

5645.88 --> 5651.9400000000005
face what you're facing

5648.699 --> 5656.62
deal with it become aware of it Master

5651.94 --> 5659.199
The Dilemma if not solving it

5656.62 --> 5662.32
Master it and then you have that skill

5659.199 --> 5665.679999999999

yeah team age is the time of Seduction

5675.159 --> 5680.679
it's a time of challenges where you

5677.139 --> 5682.78
ripen your spirit ripens and

5680.679 --> 5685.8
where you suddenly start to touch a

5682.78 --> 5685.8
whole new worlds

5686.199 --> 5690.638999999999
kind of pun intended

5688.48 --> 5693.339999999999
so

5690.639 --> 5696.6990000000005
deal with it

5693.34 --> 5700.360000000001
yeah never give it like I don't know

5696.699 --> 5703.0
what to do with myself I'm gonna take

5700.36 --> 5707.92
some suppressant

5703.0 --> 5710.5
or you just take some time for yourself

5707.92 --> 5712.2390000000005
and then you figure it out you figure it

5710.5 --> 5715.54
out through your internal workings what

5712.239 --> 5717.879999999999
you think you're never gonna be arriving

5715.54 --> 5720.82
the rest of your life in some point

5717.88 --> 5722.56
where you're suddenly unexpectedly at a

5720.82 --> 5724.78
dead end and you don't know what to do

5722.56 --> 5728.9800000000005

5728.98 --> 5733.299999999999
you're any good

5730.48 --> 5735.699
you'll be able to deal with it

5733.3 --> 5738.46
and one way to learn to deal with those

5735.699 --> 5741.638999999999
moments is to face

5738.46 --> 5745.36
your issues when you're a team

5741.639 --> 5747.96
with suffering and pride and not go for

5745.36 --> 5747.96
escapism

5749.26 --> 5752.679
yeah

5750.28 --> 5754.84
by doing that correctly for yourself

5752.679 --> 5756.52
nobody else can make you do that nobody

5754.84 --> 5759.04
can tell you what to do especially when

5756.52 --> 5761.320000000001
you're a team if you actually just deal

5759.04 --> 5763.36
with your inner struggles and face it

5761.32 --> 5767.259999999999
and learn about it and

5763.36 --> 5770.0199999999995
Master it then you'll have that as a

5767.26 --> 5771.280000000001
trophy the rest of your life not to brag

5770.02 --> 5774.400000000001
with

5771.28 --> 5776.8
but to deal with very similar difficult

5774.4 --> 5778.239
situation that might reoccur when you're

5776.8 --> 5783.6
older

5778.239 --> 5783.599999999999
yeah teens is the time of challenge

5784.06 --> 5788.580000000001
spiritual emotional physical

5788.62 --> 5791.71
[Music]

5793.12 --> 5796.12
anyway

5799.06 --> 5801.2390000000005
foreign

5804.8 --> 5812.02
[Music]

5814.56 --> 5821.04
spiritualist churches okay

5818.44 --> 5823.54
well look technically you could get

5821.04 --> 5826.179
spiritual help from all kinds of

5823.54 --> 5829.06
churches even Catholic and Protestant

5826.179 --> 5831.4
ones I I would think

5829.06 --> 5833.9800000000005
just be careful that they don't try to

5831.4 --> 5835.42
entangle you and like force you oh first

5833.98 --> 5837.28
you have to do this and this first you

5835.42 --> 5839.8
have to become a member before we start

5837.28 --> 5842.34
helping you oh really well then you're

5839.8 --> 5842.34
not Christian

5844.32 --> 5850.0
that simple yeah when I was like

5847.78 --> 5851.44
hallucinating and [ __ ] when it was

5850.0 --> 5855.1
really bad

5851.44 --> 5857.159
I thought it was like 2016-17

5855.1 --> 5860.7390000000005
no wait what

5857.159 --> 5863.138999999999
2015 or 16th and when

5860.739 --> 5864.638999999999
out of nowhere to that church right

5863.139 --> 5866.32
there

5864.639 --> 5868.84
across the street

5866.32 --> 5871.54
from the Latter-day Saints

5868.84 --> 5875.32
and like literally just can you help me

5871.54 --> 5878.5
please I I feel like I'm super cursed I

5875.32 --> 5880.9
got a Darkness over me and I need

5878.5 --> 5883.84
like an actual Christian to help me

5880.9 --> 5885.4
relieve me of this because it's going

5883.84 --> 5888.76
out of control

5885.4 --> 5891.0
and they just helped me yeah that's a

5888.76 --> 5891.0
Christian

5891.4 --> 5898.78
that's a real Christian not conditional

5895.48 --> 5901.419999999999
not all you have to pay now or oh well

5898.78 --> 5903.5199999999995
maybe you should sit through a day of

5901.42 --> 5906.159
the church first no no they they were

5903.52 --> 5906.59
there and they helped me that's a real

5906.159 --> 5909.739
question

5906.59 --> 5909.7390000000005
[Music]

5909.88 --> 5916.06
doesn't matter even what they believe

5911.44 --> 5918.46
it's that that specific way of doing it

5916.06 --> 5920.5
the you actually help with the spiritual

5918.46 --> 5922.179
things it's very important to do it like

5920.5 --> 5924.46
that

5922.179 --> 5928.8
and not to make it look into a jewel

5924.46 --> 5928.8
that you have to grovel for first

5931.0 --> 5935.199
yeah you have to do this and that and

5933.04 --> 5937.48
that and then you can have the special

5935.199 --> 5940.0199999999995
healing moment now that would be just

5937.48 --> 5940.0199999999995
wrong

5941.56 --> 5945.6
so don't fall for that kind of trickery

5945.639 --> 5951.6990000000005
right and hey they did it they did it

5949.06 --> 5953.9800000000005
unconditionally and it made me kind of

5951.699 --> 5955.839999999999
fall in love

5953.98 --> 5958.0599999999995
with the Church of the Latter-Day Saints

5955.84 --> 5960.46
and those people and I became very

5958.06 --> 5964.360000000001
interested and I followed that church

5960.46 --> 5966.52
like every week every Sunday for a year

5964.36 --> 5968.799999999999
and then eventually I like really

5966.52 --> 5971.26
recovered and I I noticed like yeah

5968.8 --> 5973.659000000001
there's too many obstacles now

5971.26 --> 5975.76
like information wise I was just

5973.659 --> 5980.4
learning too much and they were still

5975.76 --> 5980.400000000001
well typical Church Christians and so

5980.44 --> 5984.239
a lot of the people just didn't

5981.88 --> 5984.2390000000005
understand

5984.46 --> 5988.84
like what a like what I was doing and

5987.04 --> 5991.12
what I was going through

5988.84 --> 5992.860000000001
when I started to recover again because

5991.12 --> 5995.139
I was when I arrived there I was

5992.86 --> 5997.719
completely broken I was like it felt

5995.139 --> 6001.139
like a living skeleton

5997.719 --> 6004.26
like I'm about to die any moment that's

6001.139 --> 6007.28
what it felt like that bad

6004.26 --> 6007.280000000001
and wouldn't go away

6008.52 --> 6012.540000000001
right but after I started to recover

6010.56 --> 6015.2390000000005
then eventually I figured out like yeah

6012.54 --> 6016.62
I can't be like a standard churchgoer

6015.239 --> 6018.599999999999
here because

6016.62 --> 6021.36
these people are also kind of like

6018.6 --> 6023.1
hiding here they're flocking there

6021.36 --> 6025.08
which is very normal

6023.1 --> 6026.9400000000005
but it's not my thing I can't do that

6025.08 --> 6030.0
I'm a wizard

6026.94 --> 6033.0599999999995
I have to be that individual

6030.0 --> 6035.52
but I'm still very thankful and I'm

6033.06 --> 6037.5
interested because before that I really

6035.52 --> 6039.0
knew nothing about church and Latter-Day

6037.5 --> 6041.46
Saints and all and that it's a whole

6039.0 --> 6044.159
thing and the whole culture basically

6041.46 --> 6047.04
and didn't know anything about it

6044.159 --> 6050.48
right but they did it right I went there

6047.04 --> 6054.06
and they just healed me and that made me

6050.48 --> 6058.678999999999
love them and want to give back for a

6054.06 --> 6062.52
year see and that's the Christ method

6058.679 --> 6064.86
you shouldn't give your services like in

6062.52 --> 6067.080000000001
first you have to do all these things

6064.86 --> 6069.36
you have to wow you have to give the

6067.08 --> 6074.82
knee you have to kiss the ring no no you

6069.36 --> 6076.739
give it and then God gives back

6074.82 --> 6078.96
not even through the Consciousness it

6076.739 --> 6081.36
just works that way I gave back because

6078.96 --> 6083.52
they just gave it what I need and that

6081.36 --> 6085.98
made me love them and want to give

6083.52 --> 6088.5
something back and that's God's reward

6085.98 --> 6093.379999999999
that's the Christian way

6088.5 --> 6093.38
see pragmatic logical

6093.54 --> 6097.44
and unpoliticized

6097.739 --> 6102.839999999999
okay

6100.02 --> 6104.6990000000005
do you ever occasionally go to more not

6102.84 --> 6107.28
really but it's right across me I do

6104.699 --> 6109.678999999999
always like

6107.28 --> 6111.96
take a look at them

6109.679 --> 6113.34
like how how are they looking are they

6111.96 --> 6116.94
healthy do they

6113.34 --> 6119.46
still feel free and with good spirit

6116.94 --> 6122.699
because they have kind of become in the

6119.46 --> 6124.94
last few years entangled with the new

6122.699 --> 6124.94
thing

6125.04 --> 6130.94
especially during Corona which terrible

6128.1 --> 6133.679
they actually I think even like

6130.94 --> 6136.28
promoted getting the vaccine or

6133.679 --> 6136.28
something it's

6136.4 --> 6142.799999999999
bad news and I actually did go to them

6139.98 --> 6144.54
at some point and tell them like this is

6142.8 --> 6148.52
Satan

6144.54 --> 6148.5199999999995
do not give in to Satan

6149.28 --> 6153.84
this is all fake

6151.02 --> 6156.119000000001
but they wouldn't hear it

6153.84 --> 6159.119000000001
I just didn't believe it they were too

6156.119 --> 6161.759999999999
bound up by the latest thing which I

6159.119 --> 6164.58
guess that the church leaders there were

6161.76 --> 6167.34
just on board with

6164.58 --> 6170.88
but yeah even though those church

6167.34 --> 6173.34
leaders are apparently not super great

6170.88 --> 6176.04
and kind of corrupted still think that

6173.34 --> 6179.119000000001
the overall people that do go there are

6176.04 --> 6179.119
kind of awesome people

6179.6 --> 6185.159000000001
with their own strengths and weaknesses

6182.28 --> 6187.679
but especially just with honesty

6185.159 --> 6191.58
like a honesty on a personal level and

6187.679 --> 6193.91
that's great I love that

6191.58 --> 6195.239
ah

6193.91 --> 6198.3
[Music]

6195.239 --> 6200.159
but yeah Church of Latter-day Saints I

6198.3 --> 6203.58
think from what I've experienced that on

6200.159 --> 6206.759999999999
average they are kind of susceptible

6203.58 --> 6210.6
to like the Rage of the time

6206.76 --> 6213.2390000000005
the latest thing and that is a bit of a

6210.6 --> 6216.06
kind of a downside is that they

6213.239 --> 6217.44
they tend they have tendency to like be

6216.06 --> 6219.42
more popular

6217.44 --> 6221.339999999999
and and that's like yeah it's gonna

6219.42 --> 6223.5
attract more people but it's also gonna

6221.34 --> 6226.1990000000005
attract more trouble

6223.5 --> 6228.54
and you're gonna then become subjected

6226.199 --> 6229.678999999999
to becoming part of the scams that are

6228.54 --> 6231.48
rolling out

6229.679 --> 6234.8
because of that

6231.48 --> 6234.799999999999
so that's a downside

6235.31 --> 6239.619000000001
[Music]

6240.0 --> 6242.659
anyway

6243.85 --> 6247.1
[Music]

6248.04 --> 6253.5
wow it's been a great show

6251.58 --> 6256.5599999999995
time has flown

6253.5 --> 6258.0
very intense very introspective I hope

6256.56 --> 6260.580000000001
you all got something out of it while

6258.0 --> 6263.28
fiber oats at least did you literally

6260.58 --> 6266.54
had Visions during the show

6263.28 --> 6266.54
while painting

6274.8 --> 6279.719
you just keep going man

6277.08 --> 6281.219
keep crushing it I hope you get to sell

6279.719 --> 6283.46
more of those paintings because they're

6281.219 --> 6283.46
awesome

6293.159 --> 6297.54
I can't imagine you wearing a white

6295.739 --> 6301.699
shirt and tie

6297.54 --> 6301.699
I can't imagine me wearing that either

6304.92 --> 6309.3
I mean a white shirt yeah but but a tie

6308.1 --> 6311.639
it's like

6309.3 --> 6314.2390000000005
uh

6311.639 --> 6314.2390000000005
what

6316.619 --> 6320.94
it's just like

6318.42 --> 6324.2390000000005
well it's a tie I mean a tie is

6320.94 --> 6327.0199999999995
basically a noose it's like no I don't

6324.239 --> 6330.54
want to wear a tie

6327.02 --> 6333.1990000000005
I'm not a tie guy

6330.54 --> 6333.199
anyway

6341.94 --> 6350.119
I mean maybe for uniformity I'd wear it

6345.659 --> 6350.119
but I'd feel very awkward wearing it

6358.739 --> 6363.419999999999
like even as I was going there to the

6361.02 --> 6365.9400000000005
church I would wear like my special suit

6363.42 --> 6366.84
I have like a really good suit but not a

6365.94 --> 6369.0
tie

6366.84 --> 6370.679
without the tie

6369.0 --> 6372.9
so I would be

6370.679 --> 6375.3
at least attempting to look properly

6372.9 --> 6377.58
dressed it was decent enough I mean I

6375.3 --> 6380.820000000001
have a pretty good old jacket

6377.58 --> 6385.38
for my more Rich days

6380.82 --> 6387.42
but no tie and just I don't wear those

6385.38 --> 6388.9800000000005
just feels wrong

6387.42 --> 6391.4400000000005
anyway

6388.98 --> 6396.5599999999995
thanks everyone for coming what a

6391.44 --> 6396.5599999999995

6433.98 --> 6439.44
right

6436.38 --> 6442.56
bit puzzled about what to call this give

6439.44 --> 6445.799999999999
the title I mean Today's show was great

6442.56 --> 6448.56
but I'm like hesitant to like put

6445.8 --> 6451.38
anything that would directly point at

6448.56 --> 6453.0
drugs or something in the in the title I

6451.38 --> 6456.5
don't want that

6453.0 --> 6456.5
but I'll think about it

6456.719 --> 6463.7390000000005
uh right so I'll be back tomorrow with

6460.32 --> 6466.5
flat Earth early bird number 1414 on a

week

6470.58 --> 6475.219
so

6472.139 --> 6475.219

6475.26 --> 6479.639
kind of a

6476.699 --> 6481.678999999999
quiet afternoon but that's nice for a

6479.639 --> 6485.58
change

6481.679 --> 6488.04
