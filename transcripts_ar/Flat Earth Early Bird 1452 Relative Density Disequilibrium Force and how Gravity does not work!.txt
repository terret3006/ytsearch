still gonna I've been doing this for so

93.96 --> 97.32
long

94.7 --> 98.82000000000001
I have to do this

97.32 --> 100.91999999999999
uh

98.82 --> 104.15899999999999
that'll be much appreciated and yeah I

100.92 --> 107.159
can really use it right now because I'm

104.159 --> 109.68
running low on everything

107.159 --> 113.47900000000001
uh

109.68 --> 113.47900000000001
still have to get through this next week

113.88 --> 120.83999999999999
especially the weekend so

117.06 --> 124.5
some support would be really helpful

120.84 --> 126.479
anyway weather today again is

124.5 --> 128.75
beautiful

126.479 --> 130.259
there are some clouds this time

128.75 --> 132.42
[Music]

130.259 --> 134.22
Unfortunately they are also now sitting

132.42 --> 137.11999999999998
in front of the Sun

134.22 --> 137.12
boo

137.58 --> 143.459
but uh yeah it's still Frosty

141.0 --> 146.819
I mean this Frost that's on the rooftop

143.459 --> 149.72
here is the same for it literally did

146.819 --> 149.72
not thaw at all

152.16 --> 159.48
so you can still see like the the uh

157.62 --> 161.70000000000002
claw marks

159.48 --> 165.07999999999998
of the birds that have been

161.7 --> 165.07999999999998
walking around on it

166.319 --> 170.95899999999997
yeah so it's still pretty damn cool

171.72 --> 178.08
but also pleasantly wind still and that

174.9 --> 180.06
is really the nice part about it all

178.08 --> 183.78
I mean if the wind would pick up it

180.06 --> 186.72
would become a lot colder I bet

183.78 --> 188.16
that would really get Frosty

186.72 --> 190.379
foreign

188.16 --> 193.22
but that's not the case and I hope it

190.379 --> 193.22
stays like that

193.6 --> 199.85999999999999
[Music]

200.76 --> 206.159
little flatter Sage first in chat Mike

203.58 --> 209.15900000000002
zadunich good to see you I haven't seen

206.159 --> 211.39999999999998
you in a while fluttershage

209.159 --> 216.35999999999999
or maybe I don't know

211.4 --> 218.76000000000002
it's just me hey my Nathan Oakley

216.36 --> 220.62
good to see you you're there early

218.76 --> 222.06
you're here early

220.62 --> 225.06
hmm

222.06 --> 225.06
right

225.36 --> 230.459
so unfortunately my back issues are not

228.299 --> 231.959
completely

230.459 --> 234.799
done

231.959 --> 234.799
done for

234.84 --> 238.81900000000002
but it is getting a lot better

239.819 --> 245.04
but yeah I think that with the

242.04 --> 247.2
combination of all this cold

245.04 --> 249.019
it's just taking a little bit longer but

247.2 --> 252.17999999999998
yeah I had a really good meal that I

249.019 --> 254.81900000000002
painstakingly made yesterday like with

252.18 --> 257.94
my bad condition

254.819 --> 261.359
I was busy for like

257.94 --> 264.36
an hour maybe two in the kitchen

261.359 --> 267.71999999999997
but yeah I got some really good chili

264.36 --> 269.639
out of it and that that enormously hit

267.72 --> 272.46000000000004
the spot like as soon as I ate that I

269.639 --> 275.04
could literally feel like a percentage

272.46 --> 277.68
of the back situation restore like it

275.04 --> 279.36
just immediately

277.68 --> 281.699
restored it

279.36 --> 284.88
but not all of it unfortunately so I'm

281.699 --> 286.91900000000004
still stiff and still get moments of

284.88 --> 289.56
shocks

286.919 --> 292.139
and but overall I'm a lot more flexible

289.56 --> 294.72
and and the rest of my muscles in my

292.139 --> 297.0
back aren't so incredibly

294.72 --> 299.28000000000003
over strained

297.0 --> 301.199
for like trying to deflect the tensions

299.28 --> 304.79999999999995
and all that

301.199 --> 307.52000000000004
so my back is not on tension anymore

304.8 --> 310.74
that's relief anyway

307.52 --> 312.9
oh arwen's medical issues are so

310.74 --> 315.479
important so important to talk about

312.9 --> 319.919
that on my live show

315.479 --> 323.46
but in a way it is because it is a log

319.919 --> 325.38
this is all it is basically also my

323.46 --> 328.75899999999996
medical log

325.38 --> 328.759
and I am my own doctor

329.28 --> 335.539
yeah

330.78 --> 335.539
right anyway hey LSG good to see you

338.58 --> 344.34
good to see you back YouTube yeah

342.12 --> 346.5
oh by the way I had a really weird Email

344.34 --> 350.28
exchange

346.5 --> 352.86
with YouTube team

350.28 --> 355.979
like I complained about like hey why is

352.86 --> 359.24
my video not restored you said

355.979 --> 359.24
it would be restored

359.82 --> 364.44
and then I got a mail like oh yeah there

362.34 --> 366.71999999999997
might be some errors and we'll get to it

364.44 --> 369.3
quickly then I got like this super

366.72 --> 371.22
elaborate standardized response from

369.3 --> 373.02000000000004
somebody else

371.22 --> 375.5
in that group

373.02 --> 378.479
that basically was saying like oh yeah

375.5 --> 380.46
there might be mistakes made made and

378.479 --> 382.75899999999996
basically like oh yeah we're not

380.46 --> 384.78
actually

382.759 --> 386.78000000000003
repealing it

384.78 --> 389.21999999999997
but he didn't say it like that

386.78 --> 391.979
[Music]

389.22 --> 394.68
so I basically made a screenshot of well

391.979 --> 397.38
the thing that you know

394.68 --> 399.96
yeah I can show you

397.38 --> 402.419
I made a screenshot of this cropped it

399.96 --> 404.539
and then sent it to him so this is a lie

402.419 --> 404.539
then

405.06 --> 409.699
haven't gotten a response back yet

410.759 --> 414.24
see

412.56 --> 417.259
the one

414.24 --> 417.259
it's not the one

425.18 --> 428.96
what no

433.259 --> 437.0
all right so this thing

445.139 --> 450.90000000000003
but uh yeah that was weird

448.38 --> 453.06
foreign

450.9 --> 455.46
he didn't say like oh we made an

453.06 --> 456.9
accident sorry it isn't repealed but he

455.46 --> 458.88
basically like blah blah blah blah blah

456.9 --> 461.46
blah blah blah blah

458.88 --> 463.74
and basically telling you oh this is

461.46 --> 466.31899999999996
what you can do so he

463.74 --> 469.94
it was just very manipulative and I'm

466.319 --> 469.94
very grossed out

470.16 --> 475.62
by YouTube team doing that

473.52 --> 478.44
I mean what the hell are you what kind

475.62 --> 482.34000000000003
of managers are you

478.44 --> 483.71999999999997
first you give literally like an appeal

482.34 --> 486.23999999999995
Grand

483.72 --> 490.08000000000004
then you don't

486.24 --> 492.3
and you don't even reverse the deal like

490.08 --> 495.419
you don't even like oh quickly let's

492.3 --> 497.759
undo that part no no just leave it there

495.419 --> 499.56
and you don't say anything until I I

497.759 --> 501.84000000000003
start to plea like hey what's going on

499.56 --> 504.78000000000003
it's not working

501.84 --> 507.479
like what the [ __ ] is this

504.78 --> 509.52
is this a moderator team

507.479 --> 511.099
or are these just a bunch of political

509.52 --> 514.26
agents

511.099 --> 517.14
that just play out their own little

514.26 --> 518.7
manipulation games all day and they

517.14 --> 520.3199999999999
don't actually give a [ __ ] about

518.7 --> 521.87
managing

520.32 --> 525.0590000000001
like what the hell is this

521.87 --> 525.059
[Music]

526.56 --> 532.459
I'm I'm kind of pissed off

529.32 --> 532.4590000000001
that that happened

533.04 --> 537.74
[Music]

535.14 --> 537.74
all right

537.89 --> 542.23
[Music]

543.18 --> 549.62
right so anyway

545.88 --> 549.62
[Music]

562.74 --> 565.58
foreign

575.12 --> 581.02
so that happened

577.81 --> 581.02
[Music]

585.72 --> 592.94
let's see what was happening yesterday

589.56 --> 592.9399999999999
I was taking it easy

594.06 --> 598.0799999999999
I put it cooking

596.279 --> 602.22
uh

598.08 --> 604.14
let's see yeah Dell had a weird Hangout

602.22 --> 606.6
and he's gone

604.14 --> 608.8199999999999
just [ __ ]

606.6 --> 612.839
so I think Dell's basically got his

608.82 --> 615.4200000000001
winter Fugue now a bit like Tony because

612.839 --> 618.6
Tony sleeping Warrior seems to have

615.42 --> 621.36
contracted that as well

618.6 --> 624.0
the little whip on the mind

621.36 --> 626.16
where they basically lose track of what

624.0 --> 628.62
the [ __ ] they're even doing

626.16 --> 632.42
seriously sleeping Warrior is acting

628.62 --> 632.42
like a nut case right now

632.519 --> 637.339
like continually I don't know if you

634.92 --> 640.26
guys notice he's been it like that since

637.339 --> 643.08
last week

640.26 --> 644.04
but he's still doing that and I saw the

643.08 --> 646.5600000000001
show

644.04 --> 649.62
from Beyond imaginary curve Dell and he

646.56 --> 652.26
was literally whining about

649.62 --> 654.9590000000001
how relative density is in the force

652.26 --> 656.279
like what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

654.959 --> 659.5189999999999
about

656.279 --> 661.4399999999999
you just seemed completely incompetent

659.519 --> 664.5600000000001
and he kept like

661.44 --> 667.019
poking and almost bullying people that

664.56 --> 669.2399999999999
were trying to explain it like reichi

667.019 --> 670.74
and me in the chat

669.24 --> 672.42
and I was just saying like no you're

670.74 --> 674.519
just dead wrong and I explained

672.42 --> 676.38
everything and you're just being a gamma

674.519 --> 679.079
now I didn't say that he was being a

676.38 --> 683.1
gamma but he was being a gam Adele was

679.079 --> 684.899
being a gamma like a little [ __ ] yeah

683.1 --> 687.779
they all you heard me you were acting

684.899 --> 690.72
like a little [ __ ]

687.779 --> 693.18
where you can get all over excited over

690.72 --> 695.94
that hearing that probably being in that

693.18 --> 698.88
mood but you are acting like a little

695.94 --> 701.0400000000001
[ __ ] so why don't you get a [ __ ]

698.88 --> 705.12
grip over yourself old man

701.04 --> 708.8
stop stop acting like a [ __ ]

705.12 --> 708.8
why don't you keep that [ __ ] to yourself

708.899 --> 712.38
how about that

710.339 --> 713.399
yeah if you suddenly lose track of

712.38 --> 715.86
everything

713.399 --> 719.94
that that's not your green light to then

715.86 --> 722.64
start attacking all those things

719.94 --> 723.899
that everybody uses and that we rely

722.64 --> 726.42
upon yeah

723.899 --> 727.62
it's not time to start attacking your

726.42 --> 729.3
own

727.62 --> 732.98
idiot

729.3 --> 732.9799999999999
don't you get a grip old man

733.459 --> 737.88
maybe do some detox you looked

735.899 --> 740.22
incredibly unhealthy

737.88 --> 742.64
[Music]

740.22 --> 742.64
anyway

751.16 --> 757.1999999999999
I was sleeping Warrior arguing the

754.86 --> 760.5600000000001
motion of the bug

757.2 --> 764.0600000000001
I don't know what example what

760.56 --> 764.06
hey yosens

764.459 --> 767.459
what

771.86 --> 775.16
for what

785.89 --> 790.22
[Music]

787.62 --> 790.22
foreign

790.45 --> 797.6690000000001
[Music]

815.66 --> 820.279
does seem to have a Channel with his own

817.98 --> 820.279
videos

820.76 --> 824.959
including Dutch ones interesting

825.0 --> 831.5
for the Flat Earth truth oh yeah yes

828.72 --> 836.6
look this is episode

831.5 --> 836.6
1452. I've been doing this for a while

836.94 --> 842.7
and literally Flat Earth is in every

840.54 --> 846.7199999999999
title

842.7 --> 849.839
so yeah I mean just doing that alone

846.72 --> 853.2
I'm basically fulfilling

849.839 --> 856.32
Mark Sergeant's postulate

853.2 --> 859.0790000000001
like that is what he said that is how to

856.32 --> 860.399
do it that's how he said in 2015 and

859.079 --> 862.5
that's what I'm doing

860.399 --> 863.459
and that's what Nathan Oakley is doing

862.5 --> 866.76
too

863.459 --> 869.5189999999999
Flat Earth is in every title of his

866.76 --> 871.56
shows as well and just doing that

869.519 --> 873.839
already like

871.56 --> 876.4799999999999
get so much [ __ ] on your back there's

873.839 --> 878.1600000000001
been literal people just complaining why

876.48 --> 881.88
do you always where did you change the

878.16 --> 883.92
title like the first 500 shows then they

881.88 --> 886.92
stopped doing it

883.92 --> 886.92
foreign

888.96 --> 894.1790000000001
[Music]

898.68 --> 904.079
celestion negation talking about the

901.079 --> 906.8599999999999
Bold wobbles Odyssey yeah but do you got

904.079 --> 908.279
a balance right yeah flatter each

906.86 --> 911.519
[Music]

908.279 --> 913.62
Tony's just off

911.519 --> 916.139
and he's getting uh over excited about

913.62 --> 917.399
it's very annoying

916.139 --> 920.1
yes

917.399 --> 923.1
because he is probably at the moment

920.1 --> 925.139
intellectually depressed as in he just

923.1 --> 928.5
doesn't have the normal faculties

925.139 --> 931.38
available to him and it's a Fugue thing

928.5 --> 933.86
it's something that just it's like a

931.38 --> 936.66
winter depression but winter depression

933.86 --> 938.22
is basically like a die down of the

936.66 --> 939.7199999999999
light and that can be in many different

938.22 --> 942.1800000000001
forms

939.72 --> 945.0
can be like a physical collapse or can

942.18 --> 948.4799999999999
be a mental collapse or an emotional

945.0 --> 951.3
collapse right it's not nice to have

948.48 --> 954.36
that and a lot of people do

951.3 --> 955.62
but I've noticed with Tony that he just

954.36 --> 958.0790000000001
like gets

955.62 --> 961.199
like mental collapses

958.079 --> 963.3599999999999
ways trying to still run on the high

961.199 --> 966.3599999999999
level operating system that he normally

963.36 --> 969.12
has because he is a very bright man

966.36 --> 970.5
like he had he's not wise but he's very

969.12 --> 973.38
bright

970.5 --> 975.66
has a lot of detail oversight but now it

973.38 --> 978.06
just doesn't work but he still holds on

975.66 --> 980.459
so he's constantly fumbling and getting

978.06 --> 982.8
over excited and still pretending like

980.459 --> 986.399
he's got full grip when he doesn't and

982.8 --> 988.3199999999999
he won't admit to it

986.399 --> 990.959
and that's where Tony is right now and

988.32 --> 992.5790000000001
it'll pass up absolutely will it pass it

990.959 --> 993.3
has because this is not the first time

992.579 --> 994.68
this has happened

993.3 --> 997.2589999999999
[Music]

994.68 --> 998.519
the first time I'm just identifying it

997.259 --> 1001.899
as a thing

998.519 --> 1001.899
and other people have it too

1003.32 --> 1007.6
but yeah Tony's Got It Bad recently

1009.32 --> 1013.1
uh

1010.639 --> 1015.22
but yeah the whole boat wobbling thing I

1013.1 --> 1015.22
mean

1016.519 --> 1023.6
when the sexton operator is all about

1020.12 --> 1027.74
using it guess what you can use your

1023.6 --> 1029.78
body to keep a balance as the boat is

1027.74 --> 1031.1
rocking underneath you

1029.78 --> 1032.78
yeah

1031.1 --> 1036.319
you can do that

1032.78 --> 1039.02
now if it was a bubble Sextant then you

1036.319 --> 1040.459
couldn't do that because it's too too

1039.02 --> 1042.98
sensitive

1040.459 --> 1047.0
you would never find that level

1042.98 --> 1049.34
right if you just use your own back your

1047.0 --> 1051.32
own balancing organs then you can

1049.34 --> 1054.32
actually operate a sex and even if the

1051.32 --> 1058.34
if the bucket the boat is rocking I mean

1054.32 --> 1060.08
not rocking in storm conditions right

1058.34 --> 1062.6
yeah

1060.08 --> 1065.32
can't rock too hard because then it's

1062.6 --> 1068.78
kind of tough to keep your balance

1065.32 --> 1072.22
but in general there's always calm

1068.78 --> 1072.22
moments when you're at sea

1072.98 --> 1078.26
so that's when they

1075.98 --> 1080.66
get get a bearing that's why they call

1078.26 --> 1084.1
it get a bearing get the sexton out

1080.66 --> 1084.1000000000001
let's see where we are now

1085.16 --> 1088.94
right

1086.539 --> 1093.1
so Tony's just not getting it

1088.94 --> 1093.1000000000001
in many different things it seems

1094.96 --> 1100.28
I basically told them why don't you go

1097.46 --> 1102.44
watch Dell's show

1100.28 --> 1104.84
I mean that's your special he's

1102.44 --> 1108.38
literally denying relative density now

1104.84 --> 1110.12
for absolutely nothing

1108.38 --> 1113.2
just for nothing

1110.12 --> 1115.34
it's just just no no

1113.2 --> 1118.52
just no

1115.34 --> 1120.62
for no damn reason so maybe

1118.52 --> 1123.08
Tony's gonna dig into that because

1120.62 --> 1126.6789999999999
that's much closer to Specialties much

1123.08 --> 1129.3799999999999
more likely to not fumble when dealing

1126.679 --> 1131.24
with that because it's so ingrained in

1129.38 --> 1135.2600000000002
both of us by the way I mean I can still

1131.24 --> 1137.419
do that even if I'm like unstable which

1135.26 --> 1140.78
I am not currently

1137.419 --> 1142.2800000000002
except for my back a bit

1140.78 --> 1144.3799999999999
yeah

1142.28 --> 1146.72
I actually feel quite clear and that's

1144.38 --> 1150.0800000000002
the funny thing about having back issues

1146.72 --> 1153.64
is that for some reason having that

1150.08 --> 1153.6399999999999
makes me clearer

1153.799 --> 1159.32
maybe it's because of the just the the

1156.08 --> 1161.84
jolts that sometimes happen that it

1159.32 --> 1165.86
really like wakes you up

1161.84 --> 1169.4599999999998
because it's so shocking literally

1165.86 --> 1172.8799999999999
but I tend to be more fluid and more

1169.46 --> 1174.919
clear when I have back issues it's lower

1172.88 --> 1177.8600000000001
back issues if it's like between my

1174.919 --> 1180.5
shoulders not so much

1177.86 --> 1183.3799999999999
then when I got that I usually end up

1180.5 --> 1187.88
with weird emotional issues

1183.38 --> 1190.46
which seems logical since such the issue

1187.88 --> 1192.44
would be closer to the heart heart

1190.46 --> 1194.98
chakra

1192.44 --> 1194.98
anyway

1203.48 --> 1209.059
so yeah how are you guys

1205.7 --> 1212.8600000000001
doing Jesus yeah I know I mean he was

1209.059 --> 1212.86
literally [ __ ] yesterday

1216.5 --> 1223.039
I think he just had like some inward

1219.919 --> 1226.46
collapse he looked like he felt terrible

1223.039 --> 1228.44
he looked unhealthy looked like not not

1226.46 --> 1231.44
in his not

1228.44 --> 1235.059
yeah not in his skin basically not in

1231.44 --> 1235.059
his body my healer would say

1235.16 --> 1239.48
so yeah they'll probably have some

1237.2 --> 1243.2
issues but he was basically acting out

1239.48 --> 1246.2
by attacking logical things

1243.2 --> 1248.419
so maybe he was just creating some kind

1246.2 --> 1250.7
of ruckus distraction just a distract

1248.419 --> 1253.64
him away from something terrible that

1250.7 --> 1256.46
was on his mind or something

1253.64 --> 1258.38
maybe yeah you know [ __ ] happens out

1256.46 --> 1261.98
there maybe a loved one got hurt or

1258.38 --> 1264.2600000000002
something you know how that can go

1261.98 --> 1267.26
right bad news

1264.26 --> 1270.559
is always sucks but when bad news comes

1267.26 --> 1274.46
in like a sensitive period

1270.559 --> 1277.22
of the year then yeah then can be a real

1274.46 --> 1280.82
real weight on your shoulders

1277.22 --> 1283.7
in that time so I hope nothing terrible

1280.82 --> 1286.84
has happened to Dell

1283.7 --> 1286.8400000000001
but yeah

1287.78 --> 1292.34
I I deduce logically that there is a

1290.299 --> 1294.86
good chance that something did

1292.34 --> 1297.02
but that doesn't mean that it justifies

1294.86 --> 1301.12
what he's doing because he's just making

1297.02 --> 1301.12
himself look like a complete ass

1301.76 --> 1304.299
anyway

1304.94 --> 1310.22
right because it just makes him more

1306.98 --> 1311.78
unreliable to the rest of us

1310.22 --> 1315.14
foreign

1311.78 --> 1318.2
because apparently you can just turn 180

1315.14 --> 1320.679
for no damn reason all of a sudden

1318.2 --> 1320.679
anyway

1321.02 --> 1326.539
relative density isn't even hard to

1322.94 --> 1328.039
understand well it's a little

1326.539 --> 1330.08
weird

1328.039 --> 1332.539
it takes some getting used to really

1330.08 --> 1335.4189999999999
especially if you're all about gravity

1332.539 --> 1338.539
thinking then yeah relative density does

1335.419 --> 1341.179
take some getting used to but once you

1338.539 --> 1342.98
once you train that a little and just

1341.179 --> 1345.44
start to think that way and you start to

1342.98 --> 1348.28
see it like that and eventually it's

1345.44 --> 1352.46
really easy yeah

1348.28 --> 1354.1399999999999
but people that have never heard of it

1352.46 --> 1356.72
at first may have a little trouble

1354.14 --> 1358.4
trying to get it

1356.72 --> 1360.08
I mean they'll understand what you're

1358.4 --> 1365.38
saying but it doesn't mean that they'll

1360.08 --> 1365.3799999999999
like assimilate that easily

1371.72 --> 1374.08
anyway

1377.85 --> 1381.6399999999999
[Music]

1382.34 --> 1385.34
okay

1391.539 --> 1397.299
hey Richie hey I was just talking about

1395.0 --> 1397.299
you

1401.72 --> 1406.1000000000001
if you're doing a video okay

1404.419 --> 1409.5200000000002
well I don't think it's really gonna

1406.1 --> 1412.039
help because I don't think he's in a

1409.52 --> 1414.62
in a state where he's actually capable

1412.039 --> 1418.7
of listening to this stuff

1414.62 --> 1421.52
Reggie but I mean he went off on you and

1418.7 --> 1423.38
all that so yeah of course you should

1421.52 --> 1425.559
probably make a video just because of

1423.38 --> 1425.5590000000002
that

1426.32 --> 1432.52
but I wouldn't get my hopes up for him

1429.02 --> 1432.52
actually listening to it

1433.82 --> 1438.1
like to the technicals yeah

1442.88 --> 1446.659
when it comes to arguing why down is

1445.58 --> 1448.52
down

1446.659 --> 1451.4
well there is no argument about it

1448.52 --> 1453.98
because we don't know it's just that's

1451.4 --> 1455.24
just the way it is yeah and that's where

1453.98 --> 1457.76
you end up

1455.24 --> 1459.44
why is this well because that's the way

1457.76 --> 1463.94
it is

1459.44 --> 1467.24
right I mean figuring out how it is

1463.94 --> 1470.0
already a chore enough

1467.24 --> 1472.28
for some of these things

1470.0 --> 1475.28
okay

1472.28 --> 1476.72
but if the if people just insist but why

1475.28 --> 1479.24
and then if you don't have an answer

1476.72 --> 1482.059
then they just throw it all away that's

1479.24 --> 1485.02
infantile

1482.059 --> 1485.02
that's stupid

1485.659 --> 1489.5200000000002
people that do that are stupid

1492.26 --> 1498.5
and like

1495.44 --> 1500.72
basically easily give up

1498.5 --> 1502.76
it's like oh if I can't understand like

1500.72 --> 1504.679
the ultimate power then I don't care

1502.76 --> 1506.799
anymore like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

1504.679 --> 1506.799
you

1512.36 --> 1516.08
what you want to call out in this school

1514.88 --> 1519.22
yeah

1516.08 --> 1519.22
weird Kitty

1539.45 --> 1544.64
[Music]

1541.179 --> 1547.969
hey Jeff gashead

1544.64 --> 1547.969
[Music]

1548.48 --> 1550.72
foreign

1554.44 --> 1561.5
yeah I like Dell too and when he's like

1558.2 --> 1563.24
when he's in form he's great I mean he

1561.5 --> 1567.039
is like a

1563.24 --> 1567.039
very entertaining

1568.419 --> 1574.1000000000001
expressive person

1570.74 --> 1575.84
and he has amazing wisdom at times when

1574.1 --> 1578.539
he is in form

1575.84 --> 1581.62
but when he's not he is just a disaster

1578.539 --> 1581.62
he's just trash

1582.26 --> 1587.559
well not just trash but he gets close to

1585.32 --> 1587.559
that

1587.659 --> 1590.2600000000002
uh

1591.559 --> 1596.48
how is he wrong well

1594.32 --> 1598.46
George Sanford

1596.48 --> 1602.419
he basically started complaining

1598.46 --> 1605.6000000000001
yesterday during his stream how

1602.419 --> 1609.22
how there is no relative density Force

1605.6 --> 1609.2199999999998
that that's what he was saying

1609.62 --> 1614.779
like no relative density doesn't work

1612.2 --> 1616.64
like there is no Force he's forcing just

1614.779 --> 1619.779
like his silly voices but it was

1616.64 --> 1619.779
completely out of place

1621.919 --> 1628.1000000000001
he was basically acting towards while

1625.4 --> 1630.74
these Flat Earth

1628.1 --> 1632.059
mechanics that we figured out like it

1630.74 --> 1634.58
was the ball Earth

1632.059 --> 1636.86
that's how it was acting like a complete

1634.58 --> 1642.3999999999999
ass

1636.86 --> 1642.3999999999999
anyway hey Ozzy or Oz

1643.039 --> 1645.8799999999999
okay

1667.36 --> 1673.9399999999998
there is no vacuum right

1670.96 --> 1675.74
well technically there isn't

1673.94 --> 1679.22
okay

1675.74 --> 1682.82
right but what you could also

1679.22 --> 1685.22
elaborate on is that

1682.82 --> 1687.5
there's like this weird issue we have

1685.22 --> 1689.3600000000001
now right with Ballers and this is even

1687.5 --> 1692.12
from Bo in perspective so I have a very

1689.36 --> 1694.9399999999998
good view on this I've been trying to

1692.12 --> 1698.6589999999999
ball win it even then like there is no

1694.94 --> 1700.76
vacuum right technically there's always

1698.659 --> 1703.7600000000002
a little bit of gas pressure

1700.76 --> 1706.12
so it's kind of a trick a red herring

1703.76 --> 1706.12
trick

1706.88 --> 1711.679
by basically saying no you're using the

1709.159 --> 1715.5390000000002
wrong word now

1711.679 --> 1718.88
right but bypassing the actual argument

1715.539 --> 1722.08
of what the argument is and that is

1718.88 --> 1725.919
what it really is you can't have

1722.08 --> 1725.9189999999999
concentrated gas pressure

1726.2 --> 1733.46
in a very small area

1729.14 --> 1736.46
compared to absolutely no gas pressure

1733.46 --> 1739.3400000000001
in a very fast area without a

1736.46 --> 1741.88
containment separating the two

1739.34 --> 1741.8799999999999
foreign

1743.2 --> 1749.659
the real issue the overlaying

1746.419 --> 1753.2
information issue that that is the issue

1749.659 --> 1754.46
is that these suggested gradient

1753.2 --> 1757.76
[Music]

1754.46 --> 1761.8990000000001
of heliocentrism from Earth bottom to

1757.76 --> 1764.08
outer space is completely unnatural and

1761.899 --> 1767.059
undemonstrated

1764.08 --> 1769.8799999999999
it's so undemonstrated you can't even

1767.059 --> 1771.02
simulate how that works

1769.88 --> 1773.0590000000002
foreign

1771.02 --> 1775.1589999999999
yeah

1773.059 --> 1776.539
that's the real issue

1775.159 --> 1778.94
and of course second law of

1776.539 --> 1782.14
Thermodynamics violation is at the root

1778.94 --> 1785.48
of that because gas will gradiate out

1782.14 --> 1789.2
yeah sure that might happen but it will

1785.48 --> 1791.02
do so at a very specific pattern yeah

1789.2 --> 1796.46
not

1791.02 --> 1800.12
pressure and then oh oh oh very very low

1796.46 --> 1801.799
pressure for a very fast area no no that

1800.12 --> 1804.1399999999999
can't happen it's never been

1801.799 --> 1807.5
demonstrated in any way

1804.14 --> 1808.88
that that is possible with gas

1807.5 --> 1812.6
right

1808.88 --> 1815.659
gas can gradiate within a tanker

1812.6 --> 1818.1789999999999
and then there will be one end where it

1815.659 --> 1820.0390000000002
it might be much like maybe three or

1818.179 --> 1822.38
four I don't know what the exact ratio

1820.039 --> 1826.64
is but like a lot more gas pressure on

1822.38 --> 1828.5
one side than the other but guess what

1826.64 --> 1831.2
the gradient in between is going to be

1828.5 --> 1833.6
pretty linear every single time

1831.2 --> 1836.24
yeah and even the gas pressure gradient

1833.6 --> 1838.34
here in the realm is relatively linear I

1836.24 --> 1840.32
mean there's a lot of activity at the

1838.34 --> 1842.539
ground and there's literally gases there

1840.32 --> 1844.58
being made there's heat being introduced

1842.539 --> 1847.8799999999999
so there's other factors at play as well

1844.58 --> 1850.399
which probably contribute to the gas

1847.88 --> 1853.1000000000001
pressure gradient we have

1850.399 --> 1855.799
not being just dead on linear

1853.1 --> 1857.0
but a little of an asymptote at the

1855.799 --> 1858.5
bottom there's just a little bit more

1857.0 --> 1862.22
there

1858.5 --> 1864.1
but when you go up yeah it it becomes

1862.22 --> 1867.8600000000001
pretty

1864.1 --> 1869.299
steady CL steady dying down in pressure

1867.86 --> 1872.0
like

1869.299 --> 1875.299
it doesn't like oh it goes steady and

1872.0 --> 1877.1
then just suddenly it keeps on going to

1875.299 --> 1879.98
Absolute nothing and then like

1877.1 --> 1881.0
asymptotes the nothing like that doesn't

1879.98 --> 1883.58
exist

1881.0 --> 1885.799
with pressure with gas pressure it never

1883.58 --> 1888.62
does that

1885.799 --> 1890.179
there's never an asymptote

1888.62 --> 1893.059
shape

1890.179 --> 1895.8990000000001
yeah division within the graph of gas

1893.059 --> 1895.899
pressure and height

1896.24 --> 1901.46
it's pretty linear yeah gradation within

1899.48 --> 1905.74
a gas pressure

1901.46 --> 1905.74
system is pretty linear

1906.38 --> 1911.48
so that's that's actually

1909.2 --> 1913.5800000000002
the real argument is that yeah the

1911.48 --> 1916.82
pattern you're claiming for Helios

1913.58 --> 1920.72
entries about how gas is divided is

1916.82 --> 1924.98
completely unnatural and undemonstrated

1920.72 --> 1927.799
gas pressure never divides like that

1924.98 --> 1931.22
right that's actually the real argument

1927.799 --> 1933.5
but it's kind of

1931.22 --> 1935.72
convoluted

1933.5 --> 1938.6
and you have to like have a lot of

1935.72 --> 1940.3990000000001
oversight to understand it even so just

1938.6 --> 1943.279
say you can't have gas pressure without

1940.399 --> 1946.1789999999999
a container is really a reliable

1943.279 --> 1946.179
fallback position

1955.82 --> 1960.26
nature of war is a vacuum how do they

1958.52 --> 1963.9189999999999
get around that

1960.26 --> 1966.32
well they yeah they just go by the

1963.919 --> 1968.779
Newtonian model in their minds

1966.32 --> 1971.36
so that's how they get by in their minds

1968.779 --> 1973.279
now of course in reality that doesn't

1971.36 --> 1975.559
work but in their minds it does so

1973.279 --> 1976.64
there's just three gases like their

1975.559 --> 1980.539
fluids

1976.64 --> 1983.3600000000001
and like they rest on top of everything

1980.539 --> 1985.58
and that when they when like the amount

1983.36 --> 1987.1
of fluid on top

1985.58 --> 1990.6789999999999
like

1987.1 --> 1993.3799999999999
exceeds the amount of like

1990.679 --> 1997.88
gravity

1993.38 --> 2000.22
pull yeah really is this all in the mind

1997.88 --> 2003.1000000000001
then some of that gas might Escape

2000.22 --> 2006.64
because there is new gas also literally

2003.1 --> 2008.6789999999999
being created at ground level

2006.64 --> 2011.14
transformed from other materials into

2008.679 --> 2013.48
gases and

2011.14 --> 2016.659
that's gonna basically keep pushing

2013.48 --> 2018.94
pushing up like liquid getting pushed up

2016.659 --> 2021.88
by something underneath it that's also a

2018.94 --> 2024.279
liquid getting inserted right so the

2021.88 --> 2026.2
pressure increases well treating the gas

2024.279 --> 2029.38
as a fluid that means it's going to rise

2026.2 --> 2034.2
but that also means that eventually

2029.38 --> 2037.96
it's gonna exceed the the total

2034.2 --> 2039.279
combined pull of the gravity of the mass

2037.96 --> 2041.74
of it all

2039.279 --> 2044.38
and so some gas will escape

2041.74 --> 2046.84
this is how it works in their minds okay

2044.38 --> 2051.28
I know it's completely insane and

2046.84 --> 2053.02
non-physics but that's how it works

2051.28 --> 2054.82
that's how you think about that's how I

2053.02 --> 2057.339
learned it

2054.82 --> 2059.8
when I was younger

2057.339 --> 2062.5
from listening to them

2059.8 --> 2065.2200000000003
to people that are really into this on a

2062.5 --> 2065.22
mathematical level

2070.72 --> 2075.399
right so mutual pours a vacuum how do

2073.54 --> 2077.2599999999998
you get around that well by saying well

2075.399 --> 2079.48
there is no really a vacuum there's a

2077.26 --> 2082.3
little bit of gas everywhere then you're

2079.48 --> 2084.659
red herring the way

2082.3 --> 2084.659
right

2086.5 --> 2091.859
and if people inquire further but how

2088.96 --> 2091.859
how is it

2092.099 --> 2097.0
how is it kept to the Earth then what is

2095.139 --> 2100.2400000000002
this gradation how the how does that

2097.0 --> 2104.04
work oh gravity like it's gas is just

2100.24 --> 2104.04
like a fluid so it just rests on top

2116.14 --> 2118.74

[Music]

2125.5 --> 2128.5
foreign

2129.3 --> 2133.619
what is the speed of gas

2134.56 --> 2138.06
well that depends on

2138.4 --> 2144.52
the speed of gas you're talking about

2141.28 --> 2149.7400000000002
gas pressure expansion

2144.52 --> 2152.2599999999998
speed right within lower pressure

2149.74 --> 2155.16
or you just divided by how much lower

2152.26 --> 2155.1600000000003
the pressure is

2155.2 --> 2160.06
right

2156.4 --> 2162.88
or basically you multiply this roughly I

2160.06 --> 2164.56
think you multiply the speed at which or

2162.88 --> 2166.1800000000003
the force with which the gas is

2164.56 --> 2167.5
expanding

2166.18 --> 2171.64
versus

2167.5 --> 2174.64
the division of volume

2171.64 --> 2177.9
that is lower pressure and then divide

2174.64 --> 2180.8799999999997
the the pressure the original pressure

2177.9 --> 2183.76
to the lower pressure and that sort of

2180.88 --> 2185.98
like gives you the amount of speed or

2183.76 --> 2189.3390000000004
force that the gas pressure will expand

2185.98 --> 2191.7

they always do that it's all a bluff I

2885.579 --> 2891.1600000000003
keep repeating it until Brian never

2887.74 --> 2894.339
mentions it again or he said he corrects

2891.16 --> 2898.0
himself about this nonsense assertion

2894.339 --> 2900.88
that having gas pressure around

2898.0 --> 2902.88
will cause a weight to weigh more

2900.88 --> 2906.28
according to

2902.88 --> 2912.06
iliocentrism or Newtonian mechanics

2906.28 --> 2915.28
and that's just wrong it's wrong wrong

2912.06 --> 2916.9
that's not what they say nobody ever

2915.28 --> 2918.76
said that

2916.9 --> 2922.2400000000002
that was trying to explain something

2918.76 --> 2925.42
about how gravity or weights work

2922.24 --> 2928.359
nobody ever claimed that and it's a

2925.42 --> 2930.4
total useless pointless

2928.359 --> 2933.04
straw man

2930.4 --> 2935.619
it's pathetic like why the hell do we

2933.04 --> 2938.56
need an incorrect straw man to hammer

2935.619 --> 2942.339
upon about heliocentrism when they have

2938.56 --> 2944.56
endless amounts of flaws why the [ __ ]

2942.339 --> 2948.24
make something up like that

2944.56 --> 2948.24
why be that wrong Brian

2954.04 --> 2958.66
yeah

2955.48 --> 2961.3
Newtonian mechanics gravity

2958.66 --> 2963.5789999999997
nobody ever claimed that things weigh

2961.3 --> 2966.3390000000004
more because it's surrounded by gas then

2963.579 --> 2968.619
if it were surrounded by a vacuum that

2966.339 --> 2973.54
has never been the claim ever

2968.619 --> 2976.42
by anybody that has just a little bit of

2973.54 --> 2979.3
grip on how it works nobody claimed that

2976.42 --> 2983.619
nobody even claimed that as a kid around

2979.3 --> 2986.6800000000003
me nobody ever yeah because what is the

2983.619 --> 2989.98
claim the claim is it has to do with

2986.68 --> 2992.68
vertical position in relation to the

2989.98 --> 2997.0
Center of the Earth distance to center

2992.68 --> 3001.3799999999997
of Earth is what allegedly determines

2997.0 --> 3003.839
how much force is being subjected

3001.38 --> 3005.819
in the Newtonian system

3003.839 --> 3008.52
right and that's the only thing you

3005.819 --> 3011.7599999999998
really have because Einstein system

3008.52 --> 3015.06
doesn't give you anything at all

3011.76 --> 3017.3390000000004
nothing nothing at all

3015.06 --> 3019.38
right so the claim

3017.339 --> 3022.14
has never been like that it's the

3019.38 --> 3023.2200000000003
vertical position that determines how

3022.14 --> 3026.5789999999997
much

3023.22 --> 3028.2599999999998
strength the gravity has on an object in

3026.579 --> 3030.599
order to make it weigh things now of

3028.26 --> 3033.599
course in reality the higher you go

3030.599 --> 3036.06
the less gas pressure you're surrounded

3033.599 --> 3039.1800000000003
by and thus

3036.06 --> 3041.52
the more effectively you will weigh

3039.18 --> 3043.5
because of relative density and how that

3041.52 --> 3046.5
actually works the real thing relative

3043.5 --> 3050.94
density the real thing yeah

3046.5 --> 3053.04
if an object is surrounded by a medium

3050.94 --> 3055.98
that is less dense than it

3053.04 --> 3060.18
then it will go down

3055.98 --> 3061.92
and the less dense it is the more it is

3060.18 --> 3063.839
determined the more force it will be

3061.92 --> 3067.559
subjected to and less friction to hold

3063.839 --> 3069.96
it back as it is falling or press more

3067.559 --> 3072.8390000000004
if it cannot move

3069.96 --> 3074.88
it will yeah because this relative

3072.839 --> 3077.5789999999997
density this equilibrium thing that goes

3074.88 --> 3079.7400000000002
up and down up or down depending on the

3077.579 --> 3082.8
density relation with the medium

3079.74 --> 3086.5789999999997
exerts a force that will make it fall or

3082.8 --> 3089.76
go up like a helium balloon in the air

3086.579 --> 3093.0
right but as soon as there is no more

3089.76 --> 3097.0200000000004
maneuvering room for such object

3093.0 --> 3099.78
then instead of just moving just like

3097.02 --> 3103.02
any object subjected to a force it will

3099.78 --> 3106.2000000000003
be translated to pressure instead yeah

3103.02 --> 3110.099
you move unless you can't move and then

3106.2 --> 3114.0
it will press press up press down

3110.099 --> 3115.38
either way that's what happens

3114.0 --> 3117.72
right

3115.38 --> 3120.839
so in reality up there things

3117.72 --> 3123.7799999999997
effectively way more fall harder why

3120.839 --> 3126.599
because the air is thinner

3123.78 --> 3129.2400000000002
and so there's less friction to

3126.599 --> 3132.3590000000004
stabilize the velocity

3129.24 --> 3134.3999999999996
and you will be denser than the medium

3132.359 --> 3136.7
surrounded with giving you a more

3134.4 --> 3139.38
effective weight that's the reality

3136.7 --> 3142.02
that's the thing where you can point at

3139.38 --> 3144.599
about claims of heliocentrism and say

3142.02 --> 3147.599
like yeah that that's not actually real

3144.599 --> 3150.1800000000003
yeah where where does the gravity stop

3147.599 --> 3153.1800000000003
where do you stop falling when you go up

3150.18 --> 3155.46
baller where does that happen oh that

3153.18 --> 3158.16
only happens to special space rockets

3155.46 --> 3159.059
and satellites does it in astronauts oh

3158.16 --> 3163.46
yes

3159.059 --> 3163.46
yeah but nobody's ever actually just

3163.68 --> 3169.319
even measured less gravity

3167.28 --> 3172.92
nobody

3169.319 --> 3176.0
nobody's ever actually just measured it

3172.92 --> 3179.7000000000003
yeah only ever simulate

3176.0 --> 3182.28
zero g with a diving plane

3179.7 --> 3186.2599999999998
it's just a simulations and even claimed

3182.28 --> 3186.26
to be the real thing it's just nonsense

3201.0 --> 3206.76
no no reichi no that's wrong that's

3204.119 --> 3209.819
incorrect

3206.76 --> 3212.28
weight is not increased by gas sitting

3209.819 --> 3216.38
on top of it

3212.28 --> 3216.38
the inhale Ascension that's not true

3216.599 --> 3221.04
it literally isn't true that's not the

3219.839 --> 3223.14
claim

3221.04 --> 3224.52
he's wrong about that

3223.14 --> 3226.44
Reggie

3224.52 --> 3229.14
he's wrong

3226.44 --> 3231.48
that there is no claim that gas sitting

3229.14 --> 3233.64
on top of it give it more weight no it's

3231.48 --> 3234.839
the vertical position to the center of

3233.64 --> 3236.8799999999997
Earth

3234.839 --> 3240.0789999999997
yeah if it's lower yeah there will be

3236.88 --> 3240.079
more gas pressure there

3240.24 --> 3247.9199999999996
it doesn't even explain exactly why

3244.38 --> 3250.6800000000003
right the system but it definitely does

3247.92 --> 3252.359
not say that oh yeah yeah those things

3250.68 --> 3254.7
down there they're way more because all

3252.359 --> 3257.94
that gas pressing on them that's our

3254.7 --> 3261.12
[ __ ] nobody ever claimed that

3257.94 --> 3274.11
it's not part of their narrative

3261.12 --> 3274.1099999999997
[Music]

3280.079 --> 3282.8
foreign

3287.119 --> 3290.96
no it's just wrong

3293.05 --> 3297.78
[Music]

3295.38 --> 3300.1800000000003
yeah air maybe claimed to have weight

3297.78 --> 3303.119
according to Newtonian mechanics to make

3300.18 --> 3306.7799999999997
it go down go boom boom like a fluid but

3303.119 --> 3310.02
it is not claimed to actually add to the

3306.78 --> 3312.42
weight of objects I mean yeah you would

3310.02 --> 3314.7
logically deduce that but it's never

3312.42 --> 3316.64
been actually said

3314.7 --> 3320.9399999999996
it's separated

3316.64 --> 3323.339
it's separated you understand Newtonian

3320.94 --> 3324.66
mechanics never Incorporated gas

3323.339 --> 3326.94
mechanics

3324.66 --> 3329.04
why do you think that is because you

3326.94 --> 3331.819
need to keep it separated or the system

3329.04 --> 3331.819
doesn't work

3332.88 --> 3340.44
and that's why it's never been put on

3335.88 --> 3344.46
that's why in like 500 years nobody even

3340.44 --> 3347.76
a Jesuit did not attempt to sow oh let's

3344.46 --> 3351.119
fix this gas situation of gravity let's

3347.76 --> 3352.4
sew it back on let's repair it no nobody

3351.119 --> 3355.04
has

3352.4 --> 3358.44
why because they can't

3355.04 --> 3361.14
keep it separated Newton

3358.44 --> 3363.54
didn't just like oh oh oh you've just

3361.14 --> 3365.52
forgot about how Gas Works oh it's by

3363.54 --> 3369.359
accident no

3365.52 --> 3373.14
it didn't work with gas

3369.359 --> 3376.2599999999998
he left it out for a reason the

3373.14 --> 3379.6189999999997
mechanisms wouldn't work and it has to

3376.26 --> 3381.2400000000002
be separated that's why heliocentris

3379.619 --> 3384.2000000000003
never

3381.24 --> 3388.14
actually address

3384.2 --> 3390.4199999999996
weight of gas and its influence which

3388.14 --> 3393.66
would be the logically inferred result

3390.42 --> 3395.7000000000003
right it doesn't happen nobody says that

3393.66 --> 3398.04
nobody claims that even though you might

3395.7 --> 3400.4399999999996
logically infer it from the mechanisms

3398.04 --> 3404.339
which are a giant cluster [ __ ]

3400.44 --> 3407.819
yeah but nobody claims that for a reason

3404.339 --> 3410.819
that's why you can't like Google it and

3407.819 --> 3413.64
then have like a standard page that

3410.819 --> 3415.52
describes exactly that there is no

3413.64 --> 3419.16
description

3415.52 --> 3423.18
they can't have a description

3419.16 --> 3425.04
gas has to be left out

3423.18 --> 3427.98
the only way they can address it is just

3425.04 --> 3430.2599999999998
say oh you just treat it like a fluid

3427.98 --> 3431.94
and that's the reason why it just sits

3430.26 --> 3434.28
on top

3431.94 --> 3435.9
but they never say oh yeah oh and

3434.28 --> 3437.6400000000003
because it's a fluid it has weight that

3435.9 --> 3439.619
also means that it's going to press on

3437.64 --> 3443.7599999999998
everything causing it to have more

3439.619 --> 3446.2200000000003
weights have you ever heard anybody that

3443.76 --> 3450.96
actually believes in heliocentrism say

3446.22 --> 3452.5789999999997
that ever in the history of man

3450.96 --> 3455.099
no

3452.579 --> 3456.9
maybe if anti-flat Earth are in some

3455.099 --> 3459.059
weird crazy mood

3456.9 --> 3461.4
or a wizard that's grown out of control

3459.059 --> 3463.559
and obviously is stumbling and making

3461.4 --> 3465.42
nonsense remarks even from heliocentric

3463.559 --> 3467.3390000000004
perspective maybe they might say

3465.42 --> 3470.4
something like that

3467.339 --> 3471.9
but it's never been like an academic

3470.4 --> 3473.339
claim

3471.9 --> 3476.339
ever

3473.339 --> 3478.5
and for good reason

3476.339 --> 3481.14
because it's incompatible the whole

3478.5 --> 3483.74
system was always incompatible with gas

3481.14 --> 3483.74
mechanics

3486.54 --> 3491.04
never heard them say that but logically

3489.3 --> 3494.099
because yeah well who gives a [ __ ] about

3491.04 --> 3497.46
logical consistency reichi

3494.099 --> 3499.559
you're talking about heliocentrism

3497.46 --> 3501.359
I was logically consistently it should

3499.559 --> 3504.48
be that yeah but it isn't because no

3501.359 --> 3507.24
thing is in heliocentrism

3504.48 --> 3509.46
and so if it's not claimed it isn't even

3507.24 --> 3512.9399999999996
though you would logically infer it to

3509.46 --> 3515.76
be it isn't because it's not claimed

3512.94 --> 3520.02
they leave it out why because they have

3515.76 --> 3524.0400000000004
to leave it out so it isn't claimed

3520.02 --> 3527.46
logical deduction means [ __ ] all

3524.04 --> 3527.46
in heliocentrism

3534.52 --> 3537.989

3693.599 --> 3698.299
maybe it's because I'm talking about

3695.4 --> 3698.299
Flat Earth again

3699.599 --> 3705.44
I have to admit I don't really talk a

3701.46 --> 3705.44
lot about it anymore it's just that

3709.23 --> 3714.42
[Music]

3711.78 --> 3717.7200000000003
guys just keep developing the details

3714.42 --> 3720.2400000000002
lots of math and fed

3717.72 --> 3723.24
it's not really my thing it's it's good

3720.24 --> 3726.299
to keep track of at a distance

3723.24 --> 3729.1189999999997
and everything that I've talked about

3726.299 --> 3731.819
I mean I don't like to just continually

3729.119 --> 3734.46
repeat myself unless it is like somebody

3731.819 --> 3736.2599999999998
literally asking in the moment or if

3734.46 --> 3738.599
there's a misconception about something

3736.26 --> 3741.3190000000004
that needs clarifying and then I will

3738.599 --> 3741.319
talk about it

3747.41 --> 3751.37
[Music]

3753.2 --> 3759.3799999999997
get pressurized guys is wait yeah but

3755.819 --> 3759.38
it's not gas anymore now is it

3759.799 --> 3766.02
besides

3761.76 --> 3768.9
it's all just a matter of density versus

3766.02 --> 3771.98
density if it's pressurized yeah guess

3768.9 --> 3771.98
what it's going to be denser

3798.77 --> 3803.099
[Music]

3805.5 --> 3809.24
the gas is gas

3811.2 --> 3816.72
hydration it can be a liquid yeah well

3813.119 --> 3819.059
not all material change like that

3816.72 --> 3822.9599999999996
but

3819.059 --> 3827.059
yeah I mean if it's concentrated to

3822.96 --> 3827.059
liquid it's not gas anymore so

3845.28 --> 3847.4
thank you

3848.23 --> 3852.839

3851.099 --> 3855.26

3896.0 --> 3899.7
George cyber are you going to keep

3898.079 --> 3901.559
whining about that I'm gonna kick you

3899.7 --> 3904.52
out again if you don't stop whining

3901.559 --> 3904.52
about that [ __ ]

3905.22 --> 3911.339
yeah gas doesn't have mass in its

3909.599 --> 3914.28
natural state

3911.339 --> 3916.859
but yeah if you concentrate if you ram

3914.28 --> 3919.799
it into something unnaturally yeah then

3916.859 --> 3921.48
it basically could still be considered

3919.799 --> 3925.079
gaseous

3921.48 --> 3927.48
but just because of its extreme density

3925.079 --> 3928.7400000000002
it's gonna have relative density this

3927.48 --> 3931.799
equilibrium

3928.74 --> 3934.7
as long as it's separatedly contained

3931.799 --> 3934.7
from The Medium

3934.92 --> 3943.02
so yeah but in its expanded State gas

3938.28 --> 3944.8190000000004
doesn't have mass at all that gas like

3943.02 --> 3946.74
right here right here in front of me

3944.819 --> 3948.66
that has no Mass

3946.74 --> 3951.2
it's in an expanded state it doesn't

3948.66 --> 3951.2
have mass

the same stuff is liquid

3976.619 --> 3980.48
no bones yeah no mess

3982.799 --> 3987.989
it doesn't go down

3984.85 --> 3987.989
[Music]

3990.119 --> 3997.4
it's just very low density

3993.599 --> 3997.4
and it moves in all directions

3998.64 --> 4004.7599999999998
yeah I never said that gas doesn't have

4000.68 --> 4007.5789999999997

[Music]

4082.359 --> 4089.72
no it isn't

4085.339 --> 4093.14
mass and weight are Concepts derived

4089.72 --> 4094.7599999999998
Concepts based on Gravity Force

4093.14 --> 4098.299
assumption

4094.76 --> 4102.5
yeah mass is not a thing it's a factor

4098.299 --> 4106.339
it's a derivable factor

4102.5 --> 4109.219
from density because density is real

4106.339 --> 4112.88
is measurable

4109.219 --> 4117.62
it's right there and all things have

4112.88 --> 4121.219
density all things no exception all that

4117.62 --> 4123.199
is matter has a dense density

4121.219 --> 4126.759
anything in any form

solid liquid gas plasma all that it has

4126.759 --> 4134.299
density all material has density

4131.6 --> 4138.7390000000005
that's a fact

4134.299 --> 4142.42
mass is a derived concept

4138.739 --> 4146.178999999999
and it's derived from the Assumption of

4142.42 --> 4150.14
heliocentric Newtonian gravity

4146.179 --> 4153.759
being the factor that subjects it to

4150.14 --> 4158.179
it the mass is what subjects material

4153.759 --> 4159.45
supposedly in that model to the gravity

4158.179 --> 4162.52
and that's incorrect

4159.45 --> 4162.5199999999995
[Music]

4162.739 --> 4167.959999999999
density is massive yeah yeah but guess

4165.5 --> 4172.819
what density is the real thing Mass over

4167.96 --> 4175.88
volume is the derived Concepts that you

4172.819 --> 4177.799
calculate into being they're not

4175.88 --> 4181.16
actually a thing

4177.799 --> 4184.1
it's a derivative it's a derived piece

4181.16 --> 4186.3189999999995
of information that isn't a naturally

4184.1 --> 4188.67

[Music]

4191.92 --> 4195.9400000000005
how do you measure density

4198.64 --> 4206.54
[Music]

4203.9 --> 4209.08
uh

4206.54 --> 4209.08
huh

4209.54 --> 4212.72
yeah that might be a little bit more

4212.179 --> 4213.86
complicated

4212.72 --> 4217.76
[Music]

4213.86 --> 4221.38
but probably mostly by comparing it to

4217.76 --> 4221.38
the density of something else

4223.58 --> 4229.64
right so you could basically measure the

4226.1 --> 4233.120000000001
density by taking an exact

4229.64 --> 4235.52
volume of one material that you know the

4233.12 --> 4237.38
density of and then the new material

4235.52 --> 4240.02
what you don't know the density of

4237.38 --> 4242.6
exactly the same volume and then both

4240.02 --> 4246.38
well compare weights because what do you

4242.6 --> 4250.219
do same volume different

4246.38 --> 4252.679
Mass they're derived from it right so

4250.219 --> 4256.1
you basically compare similar volumes

4252.679 --> 4257.96
and then see how the densities are yeah

4256.1 --> 4260.96
how it is divided

4257.96 --> 4262.46
and then you can deduce

4260.96 --> 4265.34
its density

4262.46 --> 4266.96
that that's how I think it's done

4265.34 --> 4268.76
I'm not sure

4266.96 --> 4269.66
that that question got me a bit off

what

4314.32 --> 4320.48
1000 kilograms per kilometer

4317.6 --> 4323.42
well isn't it just

4320.48 --> 4325.699
one kilogram per

4323.42 --> 4328.46
liter

4325.699 --> 4333.5199999999995

4328.46 --> 4333.52
like a cubic 10 centimeters

4335.6 --> 4338.08
right

4339.739 --> 4344.299999999999
and I wonder by the way even how

4341.659 --> 4347.0
absolutely true that is but it's huge

4344.3 --> 4348.320000000001
usually when there is like a within

you can basically put it in water

4600.02 --> 4602.1990000000005
thank you

4602.96 --> 4608.679
to base derive the volume

4605.719 --> 4608.679
did you know that

4609.739 --> 4613.599999999999
I mean it's not that complicated

4614.719 --> 4622.58
right take a an aquarium of water

4619.52 --> 4624.5
measure you put measuring lines on there

4622.58 --> 4627.14
like

4624.5 --> 4629.9
how much volume

4627.14 --> 4631.6990000000005
would be a certain height change then

4629.9 --> 4634.46
you put the object in and then you just

4631.699 --> 4636.0199999999995
read how much it lifted and how much

4634.46 --> 4639.76
volume that is

4636.02 --> 4639.76
yeah Archimedes principle

4656.78 --> 4661.759999999999

explanation

4663.92 --> 4666.52
thanks

4666.739 --> 4674.78
we're talking about relative density

4669.58 --> 4678.44
which is definitely lending the word

4674.78 --> 4680.38
but yeah it doesn't employ these

4678.44 --> 4682.639999999999
mechanisms these heliocentric

4680.38 --> 4685.64
gravity-based mechanisms it doesn't do

4682.64 --> 4688.76
that doesn't need to you see

4685.64 --> 4691.280000000001
all you need is the relationship between

4688.76 --> 4693.14
the density of an object and the density

4691.28 --> 4695.659
of the medium it is in

4693.14 --> 4698.42
to be able to figure out what it is

4695.659 --> 4700.099999999999
going to do if it is at this equilibrium

4698.42 --> 4702.62
with the medium

4700.1 --> 4705.860000000001
which would cause relative density this

4702.62 --> 4708.159
equilibrium force and make it move or

4705.86 --> 4708.159
press

4711.739 --> 4717.04
how can you use the water method to

4713.84 --> 4717.04
measure the volume of gas

4718.04 --> 4720.76
you can't

4722.0 --> 4726.8
I was not talking about

4724.1 --> 4729.8
doing that on gas with gas there's only

4726.8 --> 4732.04
one way to do it and that is to compress

4729.8 --> 4732.04
it

4732.62 --> 4735.4
I mean

4736.04 --> 4740.659
and there is like the average density of

4739.28 --> 4744.139999999999
a material

4740.659 --> 4746.0
I mean that's like impossible

4744.14 --> 4747.9800000000005
because gas just expands in all

4746.0 --> 4750.44
directions and equalizes with pressure

4747.98 --> 4753.28
and doing that changes the effective

4750.44 --> 4753.28
density you see

4753.44 --> 4759.5599999999995
gas is more expanded it's less dense

4757.04 --> 4765.679
because the same material is spread out

4759.56 --> 4769.900000000001
thinner so the density of gas

4765.679 --> 4769.9
that all depends on the situation

come on disrupt me come on can you do

4968.42 --> 4971.9800000000005
this

4969.92 --> 4975.14
I mean this is your life's purpose now

4971.98 --> 4978.139999999999
to get in chats and disrupt what people

4975.14 --> 4981.320000000001
do so that anybody watching won't be

4978.14 --> 4985.96
able to catch up that's your life now

4981.32 --> 4985.96
that your life trolls that's what you do

4986.179 --> 4991.78
yeah disrupt things so that people don't

4989.239 --> 4991.78
catch on

4997.1 --> 5000.96
get the [ __ ] out of your [ __ ]

5002.02 --> 5008.4400000000005
nobody gives a [ __ ] about what you have

5004.78 --> 5011.139999999999
to say don't you get it

5008.44 --> 5015.339999999999
you don't talk ever

5011.14 --> 5017.4400000000005
but now but now to whine and complain

5015.34 --> 5019.4800000000005
that's the moment you pipe up well I

5017.44 --> 5022.299999999999
don't give a [ __ ] if you were right or

5019.48 --> 5025.0599999999995
wrong because of that angle of approach

5022.3 --> 5027.159000000001
I kick you out because you're a gamma

5025.06 --> 5029.56
piece of [ __ ] and I don't give a [ __ ]

5027.159 --> 5032.739
what you have to say

5029.56 --> 5035.620000000001
because you only pipe up to wine

5032.739 --> 5038.04
you get it don't get the [ __ ] out and

5035.62 --> 5038.04
stay out

5042.04 --> 5049.179
what

5043.92 --> 5052.4400000000005
uh no I don't steamy Traveler

5049.179 --> 5052.4400000000005
don't have options

5052.78 --> 5056.099999999999
I'm not the landlord

5056.26 --> 5061.900000000001
besides the internet is overall fine

5058.48 --> 5064.78
it's just like very specific moments

5061.9 --> 5065.679
it's gonna glitch every single [ __ ]

5064.78 --> 5067.9
time

5065.679 --> 5070.06
I'd especially when the chat gets really

5067.9 --> 5073.08
crowded oh we can't have that oh we

5070.06 --> 5073.080000000001
gotta disrupt the show

5073.179 --> 5080.08
because as long as the chat is kind of

5075.82 --> 5083.38
dead it never happens haven't you

5080.08 --> 5084.64
noticed it's never happened once not

5083.38 --> 5085.96
once

5084.64 --> 5088.179
ever

5085.96 --> 5091.06
when there was nobody in the chat

5088.179 --> 5093.1
it only happens when things get crowded

5091.06 --> 5096.3
that's what oh that's when you got it

5093.1 --> 5096.3
disrupted oh yes

5101.31 --> 5105.400000000001
[Music]

5102.82 --> 5108.54
yeah Orinoco wumble it's not about you

5105.4 --> 5108.54
so don't get in the way

5115.659 --> 5119.69
uh

5116.48 --> 5119.69
[Music]

5124.59 --> 5137.719
[Music]

5143.08 --> 5148.8
just the statement oh so you don't know

5145.3 --> 5153.219
okay well a gamma is a

5148.8 --> 5156.400000000001
personality type mode sort of it's a

5153.219 --> 5158.38
social sexual hierarchy so it's

5156.4 --> 5161.62
basically like

5158.38 --> 5164.62
the root energy of how a person

5161.62 --> 5164.62
manifests

5165.82 --> 5170.38
the beta

5168.639 --> 5174.400000000001
or Bravo

5170.38 --> 5178.84
alpha bravo Gamma Delta

5174.4 --> 5185.08
and yeah Lambda and some more

5178.84 --> 5188.1990000000005
right and Gamma is the special boy

5185.08 --> 5190.3
gamma always thinks they're right they

5188.199 --> 5193.12
never concede ever

5190.3 --> 5195.28
gamma never concedes to anything ever no

5193.12 --> 5196.96
matter how ridiculous it is they never

5195.28 --> 5198.82
concede the things even in their own

5196.96 --> 5200.679
head

5198.82 --> 5203.259999999999
it's one of the traits and they're

5200.679 --> 5206.5
always whiny

5203.26 --> 5209.320000000001
they're gross a lot of the times

5206.5 --> 5211.06
they're like drenched in demonic [ __ ]

5209.32 --> 5213.58
and they don't even realize it or they

5211.06 --> 5217.620000000001
refuse to like

5213.58 --> 5217.62
come see that that might be wrong

5217.659 --> 5222.339999999999
Gammas are terrible terrible people they

5220.719 --> 5225.699
are arguably

5222.34 --> 5227.4400000000005
demonically possessed by default

5225.699 --> 5230.86
like they got that

5227.44 --> 5233.199
and yeah they really do and there's a

5230.86 --> 5235.179
lot of it guess what the world is filled

5233.199 --> 5236.678999999999
with these [ __ ] gammas

5235.179 --> 5239.38
because that's what they've been fed

5236.679 --> 5241.719
spiritually

5239.38 --> 5243.400000000001
right it's just ever you have to have

5241.719 --> 5246.52
pecking or the pecking order all day

5243.4 --> 5249.599999999999
long whining complaining being gross

5246.52 --> 5249.6
corrupting people

5249.76 --> 5256.96
bullying abusing complaining endless

5253.42 --> 5258.4
whining and complaining stalking victim

5256.96 --> 5260.92
tactics

5258.4 --> 5262.599999999999
getting somebody fired because they said

5260.92 --> 5266.02
the wrong word

5262.6 --> 5268.42
that's all gamma

5266.02 --> 5271.42
and they say oh Jesus are you squirting

5268.42 --> 5273.58
yeah that too a lot of squirting

5271.42 --> 5276.88
often because if Gammas don't squirt

5273.58 --> 5279.3
they just go insane

5276.88 --> 5282.46
they have too much

5279.3 --> 5284.62
aggressive hyper energy and they don't

5282.46 --> 5287.859
know what to do with it

5284.62 --> 5287.8589999999995
[Music]

5291.46 --> 5294.0
right

5297.19 --> 5300.639999999999
[Music]

5304.8 --> 5313.05
[Music]

5311.56 --> 5316.1990000000005
what's that

5313.05 --> 5316.1990000000005
[Music]

5325.659 --> 5331.44
is missing some

5327.94 --> 5331.44
I mean where's the delta

5334.659 --> 5338.28
this seems like something

5338.56 --> 5343.9800000000005
yeah it's missing there's things missing

5340.42 --> 5343.9800000000005
I mean this doesn't have a Delta

5346.659 --> 5352.42
and the beta does not yeah or Bravo is

5350.44 --> 5354.28
different I guess

5352.42 --> 5357.4
maybe yeah maybe there is a difference

5354.28 --> 5359.5599999999995
between beta and Bravo but anyway thanks

5357.4 --> 5363.82
for that thing but

5359.56 --> 5365.5
seems a little bit outdated Maybe

5363.82 --> 5369.139999999999
this is

5365.5 --> 5372.359
specifically about sexuality

5369.14 --> 5372.359
[Music]

5379.239 --> 5384.36
foreign

5381.15 --> 5384.36
[Music]

5408.82 --> 5413.86
interesting I've never seen that chart

5411.28 --> 5417.179
before by the way

5413.86 --> 5417.179
a Daily Mail

5453.3 --> 5457.8
I don't feel like a cab of it

5458.44 --> 5463.36
well as long as you don't act like again

5460.6 --> 5466.06
I mean you might just not be very

5463.36 --> 5467.0199999999995
attractive you could also be an Omega by

5466.06 --> 5470.280000000001
the way then

5467.02 --> 5470.280000000001
classical homeopath

5474.699 --> 5477.839999999999
but I don't know

5477.94 --> 5482.678999999999
this is this chart doesn't exactly work

5480.639 --> 5486.82
like how I thought

5482.679 --> 5489.82
like or like how I was taught by uh

5486.82 --> 5492.42
fox day because I think he wrote the

5489.82 --> 5492.42
book about it

5493.42 --> 5498.159
so I think that chart's probably a

5495.699 --> 5500.138999999999
modification of somebody probably like

5498.159 --> 5503.08
Andrew Tate or something

5500.139 --> 5506.139
because it's always about um

5503.08 --> 5508.239
he wants to be the dominant over

5506.139 --> 5510.34
so he's typically obsessed by this like

5508.239 --> 5512.5199999999995
oh how well can you score with women I

5510.34 --> 5512.52
mean

5512.8 --> 5516.4400000000005
okay

5514.36 --> 5520.42
that's the only thing you care about

5516.44 --> 5523.299999999999
[Music]

5520.42 --> 5527.139
right but I've always learned that the

5523.3 --> 5530.26
social sexual hierarchy was much more

5527.139 --> 5534.58
than just about how well you score

5530.26 --> 5534.58
with the opposite sex anyway

5536.02 --> 5540.76
all right steamy traveler yeah thanks

5538.3 --> 5542.56
for being in the show

5540.76 --> 5546.280000000001
I'll see you tomorrow

5542.56 --> 5546.280000000001
hopefully oh

5549.07 --> 5552.37
[Music]

5559.89 --> 5565.12
[Music]

5562.239 --> 5568.138999999999
and how do you keep the volume the same

5565.12 --> 5568.139
on the balance scale

5577.0 --> 5579.9
well

5589.3 --> 5595.96
that if it's just a object and you can't

5593.34 --> 5599.1990000000005
like technically to measure density

5595.96 --> 5601.3
you'd like better take a sample like

5599.199 --> 5603.099999999999
scrape something off because you don't

5601.3 --> 5607.1990000000005
need the whole thing to measure the

5603.1 --> 5607.1990000000005
density you just need a sample basically

5607.36 --> 5609.9
right

5610.239 --> 5616.36
just need a scrape of the material

5612.42 --> 5618.04
assuming that it's all that material

5616.36 --> 5620.61
otherwise yeah it's going to get a

5618.04 --> 5622.42
little bit more complicated

5620.61 --> 5624.04
[Music]

5622.42 --> 5626.32
although yeah you could just use

5624.04 --> 5631.56
Archimedes principle just first figure

5626.32 --> 5631.5599999999995
out the volume and then the weight

5633.699 --> 5638.138999999999
or arguably you could even like do it at

5636.58 --> 5641.199
the same time you could just have like

5638.139 --> 5643.659000000001
an aquarium of water on a scale and then

5641.199 --> 5646.12
put an object in there and then you can

5643.659 --> 5650.5199999999995
like simultaneously measure the volume

5646.12 --> 5650.5199999999995
and see the weight difference

5659.32 --> 5664.0599999999995
this is also by the way how

5662.44 --> 5666.82
uh

5664.06 --> 5669.6990000000005
how gems are weighed did you know that I

5666.82 --> 5671.62
learned that in goldsmithing school

5669.699 --> 5674.379999999999
you water weigh it

5671.62 --> 5675.09
and then you get the volume and the

5674.38 --> 5678.289
water weight

5675.09 --> 5678.289
[Music]

5678.699 --> 5682.5599999999995

6274.56 --> 6279.06
probably in times when MOS needed it

6276.719 --> 6282.3
although skeptic is really

6279.06 --> 6285.179
been very supportive too

6282.3 --> 6288.3
a lot of you are and I really appreciate

6285.179 --> 6290.219
it and hey can always keep on doing that

6288.3 --> 6293.1
of course

6290.219 --> 6296.84
but as long as you do it when I really

6293.1 --> 6296.84
need it then it's all good

6297.6 --> 6305.179
right but you yeah don't

6300.3 --> 6305.179
make yourself poor over my my account

6307.679 --> 6312.4800000000005
anyway thank you so much guys for the

6310.26 --> 6315.2390000000005
support and I think I'm gonna maneuver

6312.48 --> 6317.218999999999
towards rounding off the show soon but

6315.239 --> 6320.299999999999
still good like

6317.219 --> 6322.9800000000005
eight more minutes

6320.3 --> 6324.06
how much does a pack of smokes cost out

6322.98 --> 6327.54
there

6324.06 --> 6332.06
eight euros and 80 cents

6327.54 --> 6332.06
but yeah I mean cannabis

6332.219 --> 6336.08
you know that's more expensive

6340.32 --> 6344.04
what

6341.52 --> 6344.830000000001
two days shy of selling millions in

6344.04 --> 6347.5199999999995
paint what

6344.83 --> 6351.42
[Music]

6347.52 --> 6355.1990000000005
are you sure that's not just

6351.42 --> 6358.58
being a little bit overly encouraged

6355.199 --> 6358.58
or is you really

6358.8 --> 6361.400000000001
no

6362.219 --> 6367.86
no

6363.56 --> 6367.860000000001
not sure okay

6368.04 --> 6372.719
but you got some kind of an event people

6370.38 --> 6375.3
like people with money

6372.719 --> 6377.52
coming over or checking it out

6375.3 --> 6379.7390000000005
I hope it works out man I mean you

6377.52 --> 6382.7390000000005
definitely deserve it I I your work is

6379.739 --> 6386.239
pretty stellar

6382.739 --> 6386.239
he's grossed okay

6389.88 --> 6393.619
by the way also guys

6393.9 --> 6397.679
I was watching a bit of Owen Benjamin

6396.3 --> 6400.38
from yesterday

6397.679 --> 6403.5
it's a really interesting episode

6400.38 --> 6406.619
I mean really because it's like

6403.5 --> 6409.86
it's figured out like a pattern

6406.619 --> 6412.4
so definitely watch yesterday's own

6409.86 --> 6415.199
Benjamin episode

6412.4 --> 6419.219
1567 on bit shoot

6415.199 --> 6423.239
called psychos schizos and zombies

6419.219 --> 6425.58
but it's like really good

6423.239 --> 6428.78
and in that in that Spectrum I'm

6425.58 --> 6428.78
definitely a schizo

6429.06 --> 6435.47
and there's apparently a lot of them

6431.58 --> 6437.04
and I I totally believe that

6435.47 --> 6439.92
[Music]

6437.04 --> 6442.199
but it's it's fascinating

6439.92 --> 6444.42
it was a fascinating episode thus far

6442.199 --> 6448.219
and I can't wait to continue watching it

6444.42 --> 6448.219
so definitely check it out

6448.92 --> 6453.9800000000005
because he's he's got a good concept

6451.619 --> 6453.98
there

6461.76 --> 6464.9490000000005
[Music]

6467.17 --> 6470.359
[Music]

6470.58 --> 6475.5599999999995
I never understood how paintings could

6472.739 --> 6480.32
sell for Millions well a lot of it white

6475.56 --> 6484.820000000001
it's that much money Richie is also

6480.32 --> 6484.82
uh well money laundering

6486.48 --> 6492.98
that's how for example the really really

6490.44 --> 6496.919999999999
shitty artwork from

6492.98 --> 6498.839999999999
Biden's kid remember Hunter you

6496.92 --> 6501.179
supposedly painter that's how his [ __ ]

6498.84 --> 6502.8
got sold from it's literally money

6501.179 --> 6504.719
laundering

6502.8 --> 6509.360000000001
that's that's why

6504.719 --> 6512.54
right unless it's just a genuine

6509.36 --> 6514.679
unbelievable masterpiece like

6512.54 --> 6517.98
Rembrandt's Night Watch

6514.679 --> 6520.5
I mean that is just unparalleled right

6517.98 --> 6523.4
that thing is actually worth millions

6520.5 --> 6523.4
you know it

6523.56 --> 6530.280000000001
it's probably priceless

6525.9 --> 6533.179
on the in the pricing Market it's just

6530.28 --> 6533.179
unpayable

6534.68 --> 6537.719
[Music]

6544.52 --> 6549.080000000001
who's what are you talking about

6551.48 --> 6556.32
what

6553.139 --> 6559.5
okay it's getting a little silly there

6556.32 --> 6562.38
but anyway yeah I mean fibro if look if

6559.5 --> 6564.78
some if a somebody with a lot of money

6562.38 --> 6568.8
is really impressed by an artist an

6564.78 --> 6571.139
artist's work they could just like

6568.8 --> 6573.27
really sponsor them and that can just

6571.139 --> 6574.38
happen it can just happen

6573.27 --> 6577.56
[Music]

6574.38 --> 6582.139
especially if you like are like this

6577.56 --> 6582.139
I devilishly clever artist

6583.32 --> 6589.32
because yeah the the darkness does get

6586.139 --> 6593.46
has a tendency to get more pull upwards

6589.32 --> 6594.96
with money than people that are just

6593.46 --> 6597.84
totally

6594.96 --> 6600.42
like only about innocence and all that

6597.84 --> 6602.58
those don't get pulled upward

6600.42 --> 6605.159
so it is usually a bunch of Grapplers

6602.58 --> 6608.219
that just glorify the more creepy

6605.159 --> 6611.699
artists that does happen on average

6608.219 --> 6615.96
but you never really know so

6611.699 --> 6619.32
I think fiber oats is work is like very

6615.96 --> 6620.69
spread out it like you can interpret it

6619.32 --> 6622.199
in all kinds of ways

6620.69 --> 6626.119
[Music]

6622.199 --> 6626.119
feeling wise anyway

6645.36 --> 6647.839999999999
foreign

6654.54 --> 6661.32
yeah but fibroids I mean do you have

6657.9 --> 6662.82
like a a cash card yet with like one of

6661.32 --> 6665.34
your paintings

6662.82 --> 6667.32
as the print of it

6665.34 --> 6669.659000000001
because you can do that I mean I've done

6667.32 --> 6671.88
that like 10 years ago

6669.659 --> 6673.98
and they still do it with a painting

6671.88 --> 6676.139
that I made

6673.98 --> 6678.919999999999
and so that's like completely

6676.139 --> 6678.92
unmistakable

6680.58 --> 6683.179
let me show you

6686.58 --> 6692.6
yeah it's it's a little worn by the way

6689.76 --> 6692.6
but uh

6692.639 --> 6695.400000000001
all right

6694.32 --> 6698.099999999999
see

6695.4 --> 6700.739
this is my painting

6698.1 --> 6702.900000000001
I still even have it on the computer

6700.739 --> 6705.659
but you can do that with your paintings

6702.9 --> 6708.36
too and then you can literally just like

6705.659 --> 6709.94
whip out your card and just look did I

6708.36 --> 6712.5599999999995
painted that

6709.94 --> 6715.5199999999995
you should do that I mean that's like a

6712.56 --> 6715.52
permanent calling heart

6715.86 --> 6719.46
and every time you pay for something at

6718.38 --> 6722.159000000001
the cashier

6719.46 --> 6725.6
they will see that they will see that

6722.159 --> 6725.599999999999
painting of yours on the card

6726.9 --> 6732.599999999999
that's cool thanks

6729.119 --> 6737.0
I painted it in like 2003.

6732.6 --> 6737.0
I still have it the paper version

6737.52 --> 6741.1990000000005
in a box somewhere in my storage

6741.719 --> 6746.86
right but I'm gonna run out the show

6743.699 --> 6748.32
it's such a been such a great show

6746.86 --> 6751.739
[Music]

6748.32 --> 6754.32
very technical again that's good I need

6751.739 --> 6756.239
that sometimes but I don't like I can't

6754.32 --> 6758.4
just talk about Flat Earth mechanics

6756.239 --> 6761.04
every single day I would just get become

6758.4 --> 6763.44
really miserable I think if I had to

6761.04 --> 6765.179
exclusively do that

6763.44 --> 6767.96
to be fair I don't even know like how

6765.179 --> 6767.96
Nathan does that

6769.739 --> 6773.94
but I think he has little bits of ups

6772.02 --> 6775.860000000001
and downs and then sometimes he just

6773.94 --> 6777.54
spends more time moderating and just

6775.86 --> 6780.179
kind of playing in the background and

6777.54 --> 6781.5
other times he's really on top of it

6780.179 --> 6783.659
so

6781.5 --> 6785.46
right but I don't have a panel to fall

6783.659 --> 6786.659
back on with my show

6785.46 --> 6789.119
