[Music]

31.69 --> 33.75
you

38.79 --> 46.329
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.85 --> 47.980000000000004
early-bird number 395 I'm your host

46.329 --> 49.6
Arwen and before we start the show

57.339 --> 61.78
Amsterdam time every day

58.93 --> 63.699
please also do support me and my channel

61.78 --> 65.8
through the Pay Pal patreon my GoFundMe

63.699 --> 70.92999999999999
and the super chat will be much

65.8 --> 73.17999999999999
appreciated so I see the chance already

70.93 --> 84.7
stuck gets really stuck really quick

73.18 --> 87.75900000000001
these days alright yes anyway the

84.7 --> 89.61
weather today is Wow it's completely

87.759 --> 94.179
different as it was two hours ago

89.61 --> 97.38
because the morning till afternoon it

94.179 --> 99.88
was pretty beautiful and clear and sunny

97.38 --> 102.88
and now it's completely covered in

99.88 --> 107.759
clouds it's not raining or anything but

102.88 --> 110.28
still it's kind of cold all of a sudden

107.759 --> 116.11
yeah whatever

110.28 --> 121.979
so today I have with me tea that's it

116.11 --> 124.39
green tea man I was up today pretty late

121.979 --> 128.019
despite not going to bed

124.39 --> 129.94
extremely late I think it was tough to

128.019 --> 132.13
go to bed last night because there were

129.94 --> 134.82
a lot of interesting streams and like

132.13 --> 137.10999999999999
then Garcia went live again with a

134.82 --> 142.35999999999999
around question hour

137.11 --> 144.01000000000002
sort of it was pre-written questions so

142.36 --> 147.07000000000002
not from chat he wasn't being act

144.01 --> 148.92999999999998
interactive in chat even though there

147.07 --> 153.87
was a live stream it was very

148.93 --> 153.87
interesting it really got me thinking

154.87 --> 162.0
his books may be extremely interesting

157.72 --> 166.39
because he does indeed seem to delve in

162.0 --> 170.28
all the extra biblical texts that

166.39 --> 174.04
weren't included but seemed to hold

170.28 --> 177.16
great information and just getting the

174.04 --> 180.989
the preliminaries of his ideas with that

177.16 --> 183.73
like how the Adam and Eve for examples

180.989 --> 186.91
that that there may have been some like

183.73 --> 187.69
sexual interaction with the with Satan

186.91 --> 191.2
and all that

187.69 --> 193.93
yeah that's completely not revealed in

191.2 --> 196.81
the in the original Bible text but it

193.93 --> 199.269
does make a lot of sense to me so I

196.81 --> 201.67000000000002
thought that was very fascinating and

199.269 --> 205.329
everything that came with it the the

201.67 --> 207.39999999999998
mingling of Cain's races because it's

205.329 --> 210.31
fascinating and how it all fit together

207.4 --> 212.739
with the yeah with the later ages

210.31 --> 220.92000000000002
including the Atlantean Age and all that

212.739 --> 220.92000000000002
and I'm very curious to read into it so

221.76 --> 229.51
it's false teaching oh yeah really it's

225.16 --> 233.489
false so false well it's um there's

229.51 --> 238.81
something there and how then personally

233.489 --> 241.66
then explains it that's his thing I

238.81 --> 244.209
don't even exactly know how he

241.66 --> 248.23
interprets it look it's not as much as

244.209 --> 251.829
about the interpretation of people I go

248.23 --> 259.709
with I just go with the data and how it

251.829 --> 259.709
can fit okay yeah Zen Garcia

262.91 --> 266.16900000000004
[Music]

268.889 --> 274.289
which stream we're talking about it was

271.289 --> 276.59
a stream last night like really late let

274.289 --> 279.69
me see

276.59 --> 279.69
[Music]

285.5 --> 292.97
oh yeah of course of course YouTube's

290.15 --> 294.83
not gonna show this one to me I'm gonna

292.97 --> 299.32000000000005
tell me oh yeah that's the one you

294.83 --> 299.32
visited right no

304.1 --> 314.41
oh look in my notifications then if it's

308.36 --> 314.41
still in there yeah it is alright

324.71 --> 339.919
okay here's the link so anyway let's go

335.57 --> 342.62
through chat started up very late 15

339.919 --> 344.389
minutes before the show started or

342.62 --> 346.97
before the show should have started was

344.389 --> 350.229
a little late sorry about that but again

346.97 --> 353.15000000000003
he had that woke up extremely late

350.229 --> 356.389
despite I think not having gone to bed

353.15 --> 360.169
that late anyway a Jorge Sanford was

356.389 --> 365.539
first an AGM michael roark good servant

360.169 --> 372.59
they like oh hi Oh his disciple more

365.539 --> 378.009
colored stallion 80 12 and a koala

372.59 --> 378.00899999999996
courts ciao Ian cat

384.5 --> 395.2
they lie Ohio good servant morning yeah

391.57 --> 395.2
good to see you all

402.54 --> 410.25
yes yes good servant yeah that's exactly

406.16 --> 413.73
look all of this to me is data gathering

410.25 --> 416.55
and one thing I've noticed about the

413.73 --> 419.54
Bible everything concerning it is that

416.55 --> 423.83
so many people and even org entire

419.54 --> 429.36
organizations and philosopher groups all

423.83 --> 432.24
have this fanatical tendency to narrow

429.36 --> 435.11
down the interpretations and this is D

432.24 --> 438.87
on the it so many people do this and

435.11 --> 441.0
what ya even before I read it myself I

438.87 --> 444.95
just knew that's wrong even though I

441.0 --> 448.83
didn't understand yet why and it's wrong

444.95 --> 452.55
not necessarily what they think may be

448.83 --> 458.46
right is wrong but that they do it like

452.55 --> 462.63
that is wrong so for me all of this is

458.46 --> 466.04999999999995
data gathering literally just getting

462.63 --> 468.78
all the pieces together and then keep

466.05 --> 470.67
looking at it over and over again with

468.78 --> 474.04999999999995
the new data see how it all fits see

470.67 --> 478.07
what doesn't fit see why it doesn't fit

474.05 --> 481.14
from that perspective and keep on

478.07 --> 484.77
putting it all together because it's

481.14 --> 489.24
yeah it's ancient history and it's super

484.77 --> 493.46999999999997
complicated really and there it's a it's

489.24 --> 496.77
quite a miracle that there's still so

493.47 --> 499.07000000000005
much data left despite it being so long

496.77 --> 499.07
ago

503.3 --> 509.09000000000003
beware of oh really

505.86 --> 512.34
so his disciple what is your source

509.09 --> 515.55
what is your holy drill what do you

512.34 --> 517.8000000000001
ascribe to like nothing else right

515.55 --> 521.88
because since you've come in this chair

517.8 --> 527.1899999999999
I've seen you kind of like bible-bashing

521.88 --> 530.1
as in bashing with that Bible so yeah

527.19 --> 539.1300000000001
now you're saying beware of Zen and

530.1 --> 543.27
Skiba it's like why you know look I

539.13 --> 545.22
point at people and then say oh I think

543.27 --> 548.6899999999999
this is awesome I think this may be a

545.22 --> 551.7
little bit risky I don't just say beware

548.69 --> 555.96
no why don't you actually say then what

551.7 --> 558.8900000000001
the problem is because otherwise it's it

555.96 --> 561.27
just feels like sowing fear porn and

558.89 --> 568.49
yeah I don't have a lot of tolerance for

561.27 --> 568.49
that so please elaborate his disciple

573.589 --> 576.86
Iraqi alive

583.24 --> 592.65
what about it Genesis 6 what about it is

589.18 --> 592.65
Siple what is the problem

600.42 --> 606.63
all right yeah I think I've thought I've

602.73 --> 611.07
seen that but and I even remember that

606.63 --> 612.99
paula points ad a lot of other people

611.07 --> 615.09
out there and say this is a mistake that

612.99 --> 617.91
is a mistake and then show very

615.09 --> 619.9200000000001
complicated reason why I get the feeling

617.91 --> 624.9499999999999
it seems to be more referencing to other

619.92 --> 630.36
people to wider studied individuals that

624.95 --> 633.0300000000001
through refine logic of approach then

630.36 --> 635.82
yeah can be concluded that it's not true

633.03 --> 638.37
or it's not relevant and I don't even

635.82 --> 640.35
remember okay I personally don't even

638.37 --> 645.57
remember if she'd say like this is

640.35 --> 647.3100000000001
completely wrong or is it or is it

645.57 --> 651.87
rather the conclusion that would be

647.31 --> 654.29
naturally drawn from it see it's so

651.87 --> 654.29
complicated

655.46 --> 660.35
Talmud doctrine are you serious

664.75 --> 669.449
and see what the tonewood has anything

666.699 --> 669.449
to do with this

670.22 --> 675.769
[Music]

679.32 --> 684.11
phony Book of Enoch really

691.59 --> 694.25
Wow

706.94 --> 709.72
all right

712.43 --> 719.8199999999999
okay so because of the contradiction

717.14 --> 723.36
thank you thank you for actually

719.82 --> 724.98
pointing me at a useful concept that

723.36 --> 727.32
reveals the conflict

724.98 --> 732.0600000000001
chou-heung cat instead of just declares

727.32 --> 735.0600000000001
- okay please get a grip okay

732.06 --> 737.76
other people Thank You ciao and cat so

735.06 --> 740.91
okay I see the problem because the Bible

737.76 --> 745.08
says out of Father Cain and Zhen Garcia

740.91 --> 748.92
threw the snake rape concept says okay

745.08 --> 751.4000000000001
the snake actually fathered came that's

748.92 --> 752.7199999999999
yeah that that would be pretty

751.4 --> 758.31
significant

752.72 --> 764.88
yeah conflict I guess but on the other

758.31 --> 769.6199999999999
hand well maybe it's slightly different

764.88 --> 773.85
maybe it is maybe the snake did violate

769.62 --> 778.29
and everything that's like the energetic

773.85 --> 780.87
there's so much about energies and like

778.29 --> 783.06
the spirit what's really going on as

780.87 --> 786.63
well with these kind of things and maybe

783.06 --> 793.02
the snake didn't literally father Cain

786.63 --> 797.27
but maybe it kind of with its spirit and

793.02 --> 801.06
its corruption influenced the very

797.27 --> 804.09
foundational fetal growth of Cain that

801.06 --> 806.64
may have been fathered by by Adam

804.09 --> 809.9100000000001
so it wasn't literally the seed of the

806.64 --> 811.77
snake that made that as in it being half

809.91 --> 815.1
snake er what however you gonna see it

811.77 --> 818.16
but rather that it has tainted its

815.1 --> 826.77
development the nature of it like a

818.16 --> 828.78
curse and then ya see so oh no the

826.77 --> 832.9399999999999
vision it's this father that's the

828.78 --> 838.53
father or you could just see it slightly

832.94 --> 842.9000000000001
slightly different I don't know Cain

838.53 --> 842.9
isn't included in Adams lineage

844.74 --> 861.22
Wow okay snake harassment right I don't

859.48 --> 864.61
know how to respond to that Chanukah

861.22 --> 873.519
well accords is it is that true then

864.61 --> 876.79
where did Cain come from man this is

873.519 --> 882.18
becoming really interesting but is it

876.79 --> 882.18
tough interacting everything in chat but

882.329 --> 887.319
ok if Kane isn't including in the

885.189 --> 890.31
lineage then that may that does actually

887.319 --> 890.31
make sense so I

901.8 --> 905.79
there's a lot of Gnostic Gospels that

903.81 --> 908.67
get a lot of things right but then add

905.79 --> 915.3
twist enough that you can pretty much

908.67 --> 915.99
throw the whole thing out yes I believe

915.3 --> 918.42
so too

915.99 --> 921.66
Gnostics have had their way with the

918.42 --> 923.61
book and probably rearranged and changed

921.66 --> 935.12
a couple of details to make it perfectly

923.61 --> 935.12
fit their system I agree to that

939.85 --> 946.4200000000001
and I think that they did it in a way

942.49 --> 949.78
that the the essence the true essence of

946.42 --> 953.2299999999999
Christ would still like the path of what

949.78 --> 956.5899999999999
he did that that would still be as it

953.23 --> 958.27
was but just the order of things or

956.59 --> 960.22
whatever things left out something like

958.27 --> 964.26
that it would be slightly rearranged in

960.22 --> 969.12
order to get the Gnostic starbase legend

964.26 --> 974.4399999999999
in there and as part of it as well and

969.12 --> 976.72
yeah with that with the changing of the

974.44 --> 982.86
details then and leaving things out

976.72 --> 986.89
definitely there's going to be like very

982.86 --> 990.01
fine complex higher mind details are

986.89 --> 992.68
gonna be yeah they're gonna be elusive

990.01 --> 996.34
you can't figure that out because the

992.68 --> 998.8599999999999
the structure has been reordered so the

996.34 --> 1002.13
most important core information the

998.86 --> 1004.65
essence may still be there but some of

1002.13 --> 1008.84
the deeper meanings and the complexities

1004.65 --> 1008.84
may be lost because of the rearranging

1016.05 --> 1019.2299999999999
[Music]

1027.47 --> 1030.66
[Music]

1031.12 --> 1033.9289999999999
all right

1053.6 --> 1060.5
yeah well chou-heung cat I I can totally

1056.779 --> 1064.37
go with that and think that Zen may have

1060.5 --> 1067.009
been off in a way but that there may

1064.37 --> 1073.1899999999998
indeed the snake may have actually

1067.009 --> 1076.789
tainted Cain's development with its

1073.19 --> 1079.059
violation that could be a thing that it

1076.789 --> 1086.5
could simply be a slight

1079.059 --> 1086.5
misinterpretation on Zen's side okay

1086.559 --> 1092.59
doesn't mean that he didn't catch on to

1089.389 --> 1092.59
something really interesting

1096.68 --> 1099.749
[Music]

1118.59 --> 1139.289
oh man it is cold yeah also by the way I

1137.37 --> 1145.4599999999998
noticed that Zen is one of those people

1139.289 --> 1150.419
that insists on calling Jesus Yeshua

1145.46 --> 1154.6190000000001
Yeshua I guess I I trouble pronouncing

1150.419 --> 1162.3600000000001
that like what is the why can't I just

1154.619 --> 1166.289
call him Jesus Christ I don't know it it

1162.36 --> 1170.4599999999998
is kind of normal really you know

1166.289 --> 1174.35
cultures even like and maybe now been

1170.46 --> 1178.6490000000001
forgotten little but that cultures

1174.35 --> 1182.1589999999999
choose sometimes their own name for some

1178.649 --> 1184.7399999999998
someone in the past like have a slightly

1182.159 --> 1187.8300000000002
different version of that name to

1184.74 --> 1192.48
account for the language or the mindset

1187.83 --> 1194.61
even a little so I think that yeah I

1192.48 --> 1200.85
call him Jesus because that is the

1194.61 --> 1204.029
modern-day understanding even though his

1200.85 --> 1209.039
real actual name in his in his actual

1204.029 --> 1212.84
life maybe have been yahushua that's

1209.039 --> 1216.119
true that could be and they just

1212.84 --> 1218.1899999999998
rearranged it to Jesus because that is

1216.119 --> 1220.58
what the modern understanding of it

1218.19 --> 1220.5800000000002
became

1226.6 --> 1232.4289999999999
and that may have became that thanks to

1230.03 --> 1236.09
them it may have been indeed some kind

1232.429 --> 1238.97
of yeah social engineering maneuver that

1236.09 --> 1245.72
they started calling him Jesus I don't

1238.97 --> 1249.59
know I just I can't really get used to

1245.72 --> 1252.98
the other supposed real name just

right yeah good servant I wondered

1347.86 --> 1354.6999999999998
though exactly what you mean with that

1350.65 --> 1357.1000000000001
I look at everything but I used the

1354.7 --> 1361.03
Bible is the highest authority like what

1357.1 --> 1363.1899999999998
does that exactly imply does that mean

1361.03 --> 1365.73
if something seemingly contradicts

1363.19 --> 1369.31
you're just gonna outright reject it or

1365.73 --> 1372.72
does that mean that you're not easily

1369.31 --> 1387.52
dissuaded from your biblical convictions

1372.72 --> 1391.6200000000001
what does that mean that again I eric

1387.52 --> 1394.77
dollar died I don't remember

1391.62 --> 1394.77
[Music]

1400.77 --> 1406.049

1414.519 --> 1421.839
haven't looked into that he did pass by

1418.929 --> 1423.549
a couple of times my interactions with

1421.839 --> 1427.649
people from the Flat Earth debates and

1423.549 --> 1427.649
everything but nope

1445.9 --> 1457.5400000000002
hmm wow he only has 7.6 case subscribers

1457.54 --> 1466.809
active Wow

1460.75 --> 1470.86

1466.809 --> 1477.07
little subscribers well yeah I'll

1470.86 --> 1482.07
subscribe check oh oh wait he hasn't

1477.07 --> 1482.07
done anything in a long time I see it

1484.32 --> 1502.84
hasn't been active for five years hmm

1493.71 --> 1506.92
hello Nathan yes right artherton I do

1502.84 --> 1510.1789999999999
that my hair down sometimes it's usually

1506.92 --> 1510.179
during springtime

1512.84 --> 1515.8799999999999
[Music]

1530.01 --> 1537.179
well remember during the summer when it

1532.799 --> 1540.24
was Sun incredibly hot right when I had

1537.179 --> 1541.3200000000002
like I didn't have a shirt on because it

1540.24 --> 1543.84
was just too hot

1541.32 --> 1555.62
I've had my hair down a couple of times

1543.84 --> 1555.62
then what what Chris what Chris Rock

1556.76 --> 1583.309
what happened who's Chris Rock again is

1565.89 --> 1589.6100000000001
that like a comedian Chris Rock ck right

1583.309 --> 1589.61
what are you sure

1599.19 --> 1605.66
Oh flat earther right I see oh damn

1620.0 --> 1626.17
all right I see I see there's been

1623.24 --> 1630.3700000000001
streams where he had cancer apparently

1626.17 --> 1630.3700000000001
man that sucks

1645.12 --> 1656.1599999999999
that's that's sad I had no idea I seemed

1650.79 --> 1658.95
like this oh natural message field yeah

1656.16 --> 1662.8400000000001
I guess from who from a certain Dutch

1658.95 --> 1667.26
person that I absolutely am repulsed by

1662.84 --> 1667.6499999999999
but anyway yeah I don't know I have no

1667.26 --> 1669.48
idea

1667.65 --> 1673.5600000000002
didn't know I don't even know who that

1669.48 --> 1676.16
was although the name sounds vaguely

1673.56 --> 1676.1599999999999
familiar

1688.46 --> 1691.769
[Music]

1713.26 --> 1715.95
right

1717.38 --> 1724.91
well yeah if I look if people have that

1721.58 --> 1727.9399999999998
kind of issue the problem is that most

1724.91 --> 1729.5900000000001
people are so afraid of these things

1727.94 --> 1731.539
because they're made to be afraid that

1729.59 --> 1736.52
they keep it to themselves and because

1731.539 --> 1739.46
they think it's a stigmata there is so

1736.52 --> 1741.9189999999999
much concerning cancer that also relates

1739.46 --> 1745.789
just to the spirit and again there's

1741.919 --> 1750.38
German new medicines especially when the

1745.789 --> 1754.1589999999999
things like big lumps and again panic

1750.38 --> 1758.45
reaction to cancer is the worst possible

1754.159 --> 1761.48
option always always

1758.45 --> 1765.8500000000001
yes stigma sorry always keep it stigmata

1761.48 --> 1765.85
stigma I always mix those two up sorry

1770.44 --> 1778.429
but yeah too late I guess well the same

1775.46 --> 1782.08
goes for my mother you know she she died

1778.429 --> 1785.539
of cancer practically or just the

1782.08 --> 1790.1299999999999
regression in response to that failed

1785.539 --> 1793.49
surgeries and move all that and I kind

1790.13 --> 1796.9
of like felt it like she's responding

1793.49 --> 1800.57
wrong she's doing it and advice nobody

1796.9 --> 1805.1000000000001
coming with me pointing that out that

1800.57 --> 1807.26
this is gonna crash with her approach to

1805.1 --> 1809.57
this mentally why isn't she getting help

1807.26 --> 1811.46
for that and she would refuse that kind

1809.57 --> 1813.02
of thing why isn't that being pushed

1811.46 --> 1815.21
because that is the thing I would

1813.02 --> 1818.809
probably save her and everybody knows

1815.21 --> 1823.429
she was just basically dumped on the on

1818.809 --> 1828.25
the conveyor belt to death in the

1823.429 --> 1828.25
medical system by everyone and I

1829.02 --> 1834.09
I didn't really know it but I did I felt

1833.52 --> 1837.44
that

1834.09 --> 1845.48
and now afterward yeah I'm like damn it

1837.44 --> 1849.51
if only I had taken control earlier on

1845.48 --> 1850.32
but yeah the the psychological manager

1849.51 --> 1853.05
for my mother

1850.32 --> 1857.1
poof I couldn't I know that really I

1853.05 --> 1860.25
might be able to do that now if she'd be

1857.1 --> 1861.54
still alive but back then it's just too

1860.25 --> 1865.61
burdened by my own [ __ ]

1861.54 --> 1868.17
but anyway

1865.61 --> 1876.2299999999998
you always find out about these kind of

1868.17 --> 1881.63
cases when it's delayed I often do roof

1876.23 --> 1881.63
that sounds creepy stallion 8012

1891.88 --> 1897.0
mm-hmm

1894.39 --> 1900.9
yeah yeah well you know what there's

1897.0 --> 1904.35
there is two for me there's two kind of

1900.9 --> 1909.0
like ways to approach cancer and that is

1904.35 --> 1915.6899999999998
on the one hand it just don't be

1909.0 --> 1918.06
aggressive don't like be don't declare

1915.69 --> 1920.1000000000001
war on it all right that's what they

1918.06 --> 1923.07
want you to do in the medical system

1920.1 --> 1927.33
declare war on it they love they love to

1923.07 --> 1930.03
put that in your face yeah let's go to

1927.33 --> 1932.8799999999999
work on let's go to this medical war you

1930.03 --> 1934.77
know like the medical industrial medical

1932.88 --> 1938.0700000000002
industrial system kind of does what the

1934.77 --> 1943.32
military industrial system does with war

1938.07 --> 1946.98
ii ironic but don't declare war on it

1943.32 --> 1949.6799999999998
and really i would almost say like own

1946.98 --> 1955.08
surgery or removal is uh only really

1949.68 --> 1959.73
becomes necessary when the obtrusive the

1955.08 --> 1962.4299999999998
thing the lump or whatever is gonna him

1959.73 --> 1966.96
in a hamper normal function like if it's

1962.43 --> 1970.74
gonna push down an artery or yeah if

1966.96 --> 1973.65
it's something really bad then if like

1970.74 --> 1976.68
the direct symptoms the the the direct

1973.65 --> 1979.02
symptoms become like unbearable or very

1976.68 --> 1982.68
dangerous but otherwise if it's not in

1979.02 --> 1988.65
some potential dangerous vital spot then

1982.68 --> 1990.5
i naturally say just let it be and take

1988.65 --> 1995.75
it easy don't panic

1990.5 --> 2000.28
try to see it as a natural mechanic and

1995.75 --> 2004.28
kind of figure out what caused that

2000.28 --> 2007.1
psychosomatically and what well if it's

2004.28 --> 2009.59
become big or whatever what is feeding

2007.1 --> 2012.56
into that from the body what is causing

2009.59 --> 2017.6599999999999
the metabolic instability in order for

2012.56 --> 2021.98
that to do that to that degree and that

2017.66 --> 2024.1100000000001
may be due to whatever medications bad

2021.98 --> 2027.3600000000001
food habits

2024.11 --> 2037.289
even drug addictions all kinds of things

2027.36 --> 2039.86
so oh sorry to hear that flattered

2037.289 --> 2039.86
spaceman

2046.16 --> 2051.7400000000002
all right so anyway for me what I kind

2049.399 --> 2055.669
of did spiritually for myself as a

2051.74 --> 2058.4289999999996
decision is declare myself to be my own

2055.669 --> 2061.879
doctor first like take that medical

2058.429 --> 2065.44
sovereignty for myself very critical for

2061.879 --> 2070.79
me like I'm the only one I really trust

2065.44 --> 2073.1
had it in the end although there's other

2070.79 --> 2077.12
people that that I do have learned to

2073.1 --> 2083.149
trust because of all that clarity they

2077.12 --> 2087.2
give me and their principles but that's

2083.149 --> 2090.44
the first step and then it's all about

2087.2 --> 2093.4289999999996
giving recognition to the processes of

2090.44 --> 2097.04
the body things like you become sick

2093.429 --> 2098.9900000000002
that is a part of the metabolism and how

2097.04 --> 2101.06
it works the psychosomatic smelling it

2098.99 --> 2104.54
and then realize okay if something

2101.06 --> 2108.5
really heavy is happening it's very

2104.54 --> 2110.87
likely to be psychosomatic after a fact

2108.5 --> 2113.06
like an aftershock which is explained in

2110.87 --> 2115.99
the German new medicine especially with

2113.06 --> 2121.73
me personally since I've had a lot of

2115.99 --> 2122.3599999999997
intense mental conflicts with myself and

2121.73 --> 2124.31
the world

2122.36 --> 2127.4
that'd been it's bound to have pretty

2124.31 --> 2129.56
heavy side effects aftershocks and I've

2127.4 --> 2136.58
had I've been through a lot of those in

2129.56 --> 2140.27
the last five years a lot and yeah well

2136.58 --> 2142.7599999999998
then it's a matter what I did is

2140.27 --> 2145.88
basically say okay well every time I

2142.76 --> 2150.53
need to communicate all of this to

2145.88 --> 2153.7400000000002
people to kind of get a better

2150.53 --> 2155.48
understanding not to to widen the gap in

2153.74 --> 2157.97
understanding I can't I'll keep it to

2155.48 --> 2159.95
myself I have to be informed I have to

2157.97 --> 2160.37
hear other people's feelings about it as

2159.95 --> 2163.91
well

2160.37 --> 2165.97
and and make them understand how I

2163.91 --> 2170.0
approach it and that it is really

2165.97 --> 2173.2099999999996
sensible it's not just some paranoia

2170.0 --> 2176.84
that no it's it's well thought out how I

2173.21 --> 2178.89
do the things I do with my body and how

2176.84 --> 2181.83
I approach it medically

2178.89 --> 2186.0899999999997
and then yeah it's all a matter of

2181.83 --> 2189.33
really taking that suppose in war that

2186.09 --> 2193.28
hospitals like you to declare on some

2189.33 --> 2200.94
disease or some problem cancer and

2193.28 --> 2205.02
actually be defensive it is like a war

2200.94 --> 2207.66
but it's a war against us and they are

2205.02 --> 2212.04
making us declare war on ourselves on

2207.66 --> 2213.33
the parts of our body in a way that and

2212.04 --> 2218.46
that is the war and that is what we

2213.33 --> 2221.9
really have to defend against and to be

2218.46 --> 2223.53
more tolerant to our own physical

2221.9 --> 2227.6600000000003
processes and have a better

2223.53 --> 2234.84
understanding for it as to keep a better

2227.66 --> 2237.72
spiritual balance and help all the

2234.84 --> 2239.13
things to heal not panic not do

2237.72 --> 2242.9399999999996
something drastic

2239.13 --> 2245.1600000000003
on the long on the on the short term out

2242.94 --> 2247.9500000000003
of a panic and then end up with more

2245.16 --> 2249.5699999999997
damage on the long run because that is

2247.95 --> 2251.91
something that typically happens in the

2249.57 --> 2255.81
medical in the allopathic medical system

2251.91 --> 2258.66
if you're not careful so that is how I

2255.81 --> 2263.25
always approach it but that that's me

2258.66 --> 2267.17
and it's like yeah declaring personal

2263.25 --> 2270.84
medical sovereignty is psychologically

2267.17 --> 2273.0
extremely tough because there is a lot

2270.84 --> 2275.1000000000004
of people that it's kind of like baller

2273.0 --> 2276.78
things you know the ballers know all

2275.1 --> 2279.95
this body of sigh all these mechanisms

2276.78 --> 2284.34
all that stuff huge preponderance of

2279.95 --> 2286.2
data right and they attack you with it

2284.34 --> 2288.1800000000003
well if you're gonna declare medical

2286.2 --> 2291.06
sovereignty on yourself and basically

2288.18 --> 2293.73
reject allopathic standards then there's

2291.06 --> 2297.18
an entire apparatus of doctors and

2293.73 --> 2298.89
medical study people that are kind of

2297.18 --> 2300.93
are gonna have the same response now

2298.89 --> 2302.52
they have also learned of course as

2300.93 --> 2308.2799999999997
doctors and everything to be a little

2302.52 --> 2311.58
bit more responsible but then yeah they

2308.28 --> 2312.76
might be more inclined to for example

2311.58 --> 2314.98
really declare

2312.76 --> 2317.05
insane and and have then figure out the

2314.98 --> 2319.6
medical grounds from their angle of

2317.05 --> 2322.9300000000003
approach to do that or something so it

2319.6 --> 2326.62
is very tough to declare personal

2322.93 --> 2330.73
medical sovereignty to say no you have

2326.62 --> 2334.0
absolutely no say or even no telling

2330.73 --> 2337.32
over you're not going to say to me what

2334.0 --> 2340.0
is happening in my body I will not

2337.32 --> 2346.63
blindly listen to anyone but my own

2340.0 --> 2349.48
study about it yeah and it's tough

2346.63 --> 2351.82
because yeah you're gonna face a medical

2349.48 --> 2354.82
system when you do that that's gonna be

2351.82 --> 2357.1600000000003
hostile like a spiritual hostile entity

2354.82 --> 2360.75
toward you it's very dangerous doesn't

2357.16 --> 2363.42
mean that every doctor is gonna be mu

2360.75 --> 2365.74
dangerous just means that there will be

2363.42 --> 2368.65
individuals among them that will

2365.74 --> 2371.77
adamantly spiritually oppose you and

2368.65 --> 2375.94
actually act hostile just like so like

2371.77 --> 2380.64
ballers do and very unexpectedly when

2375.94 --> 2383.17
that happens it does happen be careful

2380.64 --> 2385.2999999999997
when there's doctors that actually do

2383.17 --> 2387.04
recognize it that are just doctors that

2385.3 --> 2389.02
are trying to go along to get along but

2387.04 --> 2391.69
they do realize there's problems and

2389.02 --> 2394.21
those doctors they may actually help you

2391.69 --> 2396.76
you have to figure it out very carefully

2394.21 --> 2401.43
which doctors you can trust and to what

2396.76 --> 2401.4300000000003
degree and what drives them

2403.68 --> 2408.1099999999997
if you're going to get involved with

2405.69 --> 2408.11
doctors

2451.76 --> 2457.3100000000004
now they're laiá laiá unfortunately

2454.82 --> 2459.79
being a hardcore Christian doesn't solve

2457.31 --> 2459.79
all your problems

2473.71 --> 2478.51
[Music]

2474.9 --> 2482.579
but the Bible is very enlightening we'll

2478.51 --> 2486.309
reveal a lot of truth about the world

2482.579 --> 2488.38
but at the same time you can also

2486.309 --> 2491.4300000000003
definitely use it as a source of

2488.38 --> 2496.26
escapism to actually avoid the truth and

2491.43 --> 2499.93
not solve certain issues with yourself

2496.26 --> 2503.38
with whatever so being a hardcore

2499.93 --> 2507.64
Christian can be just as detrimental as

2503.38 --> 2511.329
it is useful to be a Christian it's a

2507.64 --> 2513.97
beat yeah fanaticism is rarely a good

2511.329 --> 2518.3390000000004
thing really because what it typically

2513.97 --> 2522.04
does is narrow down the options to

2518.339 --> 2526.77
unreasonable levels and shutter the view

2522.04 --> 2529.69
and narrow down tolerance also

2526.77 --> 2532.319
fanaticism inspires intolerance

2529.69 --> 2532.319
naturally

2544.99 --> 2550.93
I'm not saying you can't be passionate

2547.48 --> 2553.15
can't be I'm not saying you can be

2550.93 --> 2555.97
dedicated I'm just saying that real

2553.15 --> 2558.9100000000003
fanaticism is kind of like a form of

2555.97 --> 2562.5989999999997
escapism it's getting drunk on the on

2558.91 --> 2566.2
the positive vibes and then yeah that's

2562.599 --> 2568.69
a problem really it becomes a problem

2566.2 --> 2571.48
it's like a back door

2568.69 --> 2573.43
you think you solved everything but you

2571.48 --> 2575.95
didn't because you can never solve

2573.43 --> 2579.1299999999997
everything you always have to keep on

2575.95 --> 2581.589
solving problems forever your entire

2579.13 --> 2586.15
life and there's net this never ends

2581.589 --> 2589.2599999999998
never ends until you're dead and that's

2586.15 --> 2592.77
a big problem that a lot of people have

2589.26 --> 2592.7700000000004
fall prey to

2603.38 --> 2610.13
God what is this can help reverse

2632.82 --> 2639.4
[Music]

2644.91 --> 2651.96
yeah well Nathan if you're gonna keep on

2647.869 --> 2656.2200000000003
putting out that whole big earthing then

2651.96 --> 2658.9700000000003
maybe you should make a proper Poe pack

2656.22 --> 2658.97
for yourself

2663.79 --> 2669.73
we're yeah the the actual nature is more

2667.869 --> 2672.88
better emphasized maybe you should just

2669.73 --> 2676.6
make a head for yourself like that maybe

2672.88 --> 2679.48
you could wear it during during

2676.6 --> 2684.1189999999997
Halloween or something next year I

2679.48 --> 2684.119
wouldn't married on a family show

2684.96 --> 2688.139
[Music]

2696.85 --> 2699.5099999999998
No

2713.17 --> 2723.7200000000003
it's God

2720.549 --> 2723.72
I really

2730.64 --> 2736.1299999999997
Yeah right i've almost forgot about that

2733.069 --> 2741.009
the whole Church of Flat Earth talks in

2736.13 --> 2745.489
the iron row meeting yesterday man I

2741.009 --> 2749.239
thought that it's like interesting

2745.489 --> 2753.589
especially because of the I guess

2749.239 --> 2756.4700000000003
judicial implications of it but I still

2753.589 --> 2766.4
wonder if it's if it's wise to do that

2756.47 --> 2770.8999999999996
in the long run like seriously what what

2766.4 --> 2774.579
what if okay if we got that if we got it

2770.9 --> 2778.869
like a religion what ifs are certain say

2774.579 --> 2782.0890000000004
demonic nut cases start to say oh yeah

2778.869 --> 2784.6400000000003
ha ha I'm gonna destroy this I'm gonna

2782.089 --> 2787.099
destroy Flat Earth now by acting like a

2784.64 --> 2791.3799999999997
safe flat earth Flat Earth in the name

2787.099 --> 2795.4100000000003
of Flat Earth i smite thee and then just

2791.38 --> 2797.239
that [ __ ] that that also can happen if

2795.41 --> 2802.97
you actually make something into an

2797.239 --> 2807.339
official religion although yeah at this

2802.97 --> 2807.339
point they'll probably do that anyway

2814.05 --> 2821.52
yeah but Nathan it's you know it's

2817.95 --> 2825.48
actually may the force that is not

2821.52 --> 2829.05
actually a force but you can and must

2825.48 --> 2831.72
think of it as a force be with you

2829.05 --> 2833.55
that's the real one are you always

2831.72 --> 2846.8599999999997
shorten it down you always shorten down

2833.55 --> 2853.34
the prayers that's hilarious

2846.86 --> 2857.61
you know what I should have like a a big

2853.34 --> 2860.25
plastic block letter R and then hold it

2857.61 --> 2864.29
up the power of our compels you the

2860.25 --> 2864.29
power of our compels you

2886.44 --> 2906.9700000000003
doctrinal what I don't know it's may the

2903.55 --> 2909.67
force that is not actually force but you

2906.97 --> 2912.8689999999997
can and must think of it as a force be

2909.67 --> 2915.88
with you that is a double reference to

2912.869 --> 2918.4900000000002
what has been said about gravity those

2915.88 --> 2920.5
special recordings the special moments

2918.49 --> 2924.3599999999997
of accidental honesty that we recorded

2920.5 --> 2924.36
its to grafted into one

2952.66 --> 2961.74
now he's not going live no it's just

2958.39 --> 2961.74
sending out a premiere so

2990.13 --> 3001.4900000000002
Martin L oh I I don't know does he do

2998.56 --> 3001.49
live streams too

3019.27 --> 3021.96
god

3023.63 --> 3030.08
yeah yeah except it acts like one but

3027.23 --> 3033.41
you don't really know what it is so it

3030.08 --> 3037.0699999999997
acts like a force but there is no actual

3033.41 --> 3040.73
force that can be attributed to it so

3037.07 --> 3041.57
that's very nice cept happy yeah it is

3040.73 --> 3046.52
an accident

3041.57 --> 3048.6800000000003
you think it's smart but what baller

3046.52 --> 3051.47
believers and their gravity don't

3048.68 --> 3055.04
realize is that in thinking that it's

3051.47 --> 3058.16
kind of technically smart originally why

3055.04 --> 3060.65
that wasn't realized is because it's

3058.16 --> 3064.43
looked away from what gravity really is

3060.65 --> 3066.02
because by getting this one extra layer

3064.43 --> 3068.2999999999997
of understanding with yeah it's really

3066.02 --> 3071.0
smart but you're just getting closer to

3068.3 --> 3077.3500000000004
what it really is or rather what it

3071.0 --> 3077.35
isn't and that's the problem for you

3086.48 --> 3089.579
[Music]

3099.28 --> 3104.1400000000003
all right so yeah you can say that it

3101.62 --> 3107.2
acts like a force but you don't know how

3104.14 --> 3112.08
you don't know where it actually ties in

3107.2 --> 3112.08
you can't prove it

3139.0 --> 3144.49
yeah that's right septic that's right

3141.91 --> 3146.41
all of them all of them that you like to

3144.49 --> 3148.39
pile on there and they probably at some

3146.41 --> 3150.25
point virtuous signal yeah I will go

3148.39 --> 3153.64
along to get along doesn't mean that

3150.25 --> 3155.89
they're really with you it's just a

3153.64 --> 3159.7
freaking consensus game as part of your

3155.89 --> 3165.37
religious peer pressure crap system that

3159.7 --> 3167.68
was designed to do huh and yeah 300 BC

3165.37 --> 3170.62
though that's that's total [ __ ]

3167.68 --> 3172.39
but yeah the entire system probably came

3170.62 --> 3175.96
from Babylon it's the reversed world

3172.39 --> 3179.3399999999997
mechanism the idea was probably there

3175.96 --> 3182.11
thousands of years ago that's right

3179.34 --> 3187.42
doesn't mean that it's correct it just

3182.11 --> 3193.03
means that for an historically epically

3187.42 --> 3199.44
long age a lot of people and a more

3193.03 --> 3199.44
increasingly so are extremely delusional

3200.4 --> 3203.7000000000003
that's right

3224.41 --> 3227.62
[Music]

3235.4 --> 3240.75
never practice science in their entire

3238.38 --> 3244.92
life you don't even know what science is

3240.75 --> 3249.24
and you don't even know if they actually

3244.92 --> 3252.12
did practice science or that you just

3249.24 --> 3255.24
think that they did because they say

3252.12 --> 3259.62
they do and the general consensus of the

3255.24 --> 3262.77
scientist Malaysian system demands that

3259.62 --> 3271.2
they declare this falsely yeah

3262.77 --> 3275.42
is that tapi so you just think that they

3271.2 --> 3275.4199999999996
practice all this science they didn't

3276.05 --> 3281.6000000000004
the beliefs you carry are not based on

3279.45 --> 3283.71
science they're all based on

3281.6 --> 3287.72
presuppositional mathematical

3283.71 --> 3293.36
extrapolations serve and declare

3287.72 --> 3297.3599999999997
according to a very fine-tuned

3293.36 --> 3301.5
replacement mechanism framework to

3297.36 --> 3304.98
replace entire reality to try to bypass

3301.5 --> 3307.53
as much of the core fundamentals of the

3304.98 --> 3309.9900000000002
actual reality as possible and provide a

3307.53 --> 3312.84
delusional framework that could somehow

3309.99 --> 3318.06
pose as an alternative and it works on

3312.84 --> 3320.96
people it's the reverse world you can

3318.06 --> 3320.96
get stuck there

3332.13 --> 3338.37
it's not a coin goodtimz for all its a

3334.68 --> 3347.93
pendant it's pure it is pure silver

3338.37 --> 3358.1099999999997
though but I put what is it I in graved

3347.93 --> 3360.3199999999997
the flower of life into it and I can use

3358.11 --> 3364.07
this for medical applications as well

3360.32 --> 3364.07
because it's pure silver

3398.54 --> 3405.38
and soon cover in got hmm cool

3402.13 --> 3408.1600000000003
is it a naturally formed in gut or it

3405.38 --> 3408.1600000000003
has it been purified

3417.49 --> 3423.0699999999997
because yeah if you're gonna if you want

3420.099 --> 3425.6800000000003
to apply it medically I I'd go for the

3423.07 --> 3428.9500000000003
absolute best purification because you

3425.68 --> 3438.66
want the pure silver you know if it's

3428.95 --> 3442.39
just regular jewelry silver like this

3438.66 --> 3444.8489999999997
then there's also going to be

3442.39 --> 3446.74
seven-and-a-half percent of copper and

3444.849 --> 3450.51
some other remnants in it and that

3446.74 --> 3453.43
doesn't work so well it can still work

3450.51 --> 3456.849
but with the pure silver you can

3453.43 --> 3460.68
practically like if I for some reason or

3456.849 --> 3463.7200000000003
whatever had to go through some very

3460.68 --> 3466.0
disgusting place like if I for beef from

3463.72 --> 3467.77
Ted I'm not gonna do that but for

3466.0 --> 3470.23
example if I would have to be forced

3467.77 --> 3472.24
somehow without super protective

3470.23 --> 3478.48
clothing to walk through a sewer or

3472.24 --> 3481.4799999999996
whatever I'd probably do put that in my

3478.48 --> 3483.79
mouth like fifty minutes ahead of time

3481.48 --> 3489.73
and then as I go through it keep it in

3483.79 --> 3492.04
there just for the extra silver I could

3489.73 --> 3494.589
do that or you could take a sip of

3492.04 --> 3498.0099999999998
colloidal silver if you got that but

3494.589 --> 3503.08
yeah this kind of works I think it's

3498.01 --> 3505.8390000000004
better than nothing so that's cool

3503.08 --> 3509.23
that's that's why I kind of extra like

3505.839 --> 3512.74
it because this is not just a visual

3509.23 --> 3515.19
trinket I can actually use this now that

3512.74 --> 3515.1899999999996
is cool

3518.01 --> 3523.7400000000002
it kind of feels like you know doctors

3521.13 --> 3526.619
have a stethoscope around their neck

3523.74 --> 3531.4199999999996
well in a way this is a medical tool for

3526.619 --> 3534.5
me as well just a lot of people don't

3531.42 --> 3534.5
necessarily know it

3544.94 --> 3548.44
[Music]

3553.05 --> 3558.4500000000003
has anybody heard from Amanda young I

3556.75 --> 3561.73
haven't seen her in a while

3558.45 --> 3565.39
although I do BIM bump into her at later

3561.73 --> 3569.7400000000002
times during later hangout so I don't

3565.39 --> 3573.73
know I hope she's doing all right maybe

3569.74 --> 3577.33
she's got work or something that she

3573.73 --> 3581.05
can't watch the show in the mornings

3577.33 --> 3585.93
anymore not too sure she wasn't

3581.05 --> 3585.9300000000003
chattered what I didn't see her where I

3586.2 --> 3596.3999999999996
didn't mention her no no she she wasn't

3597.66 --> 3608.83
what oh there you are sorry I must have

3603.76 --> 3610.86
overlooked Jeff hope you're doing all

3608.83 --> 3610.86
right

3615.94 --> 3619.119
[Music]

3633.44 --> 3642.379
anyway should I talk about next

3639.3 --> 3642.3790000000004
[Music]

3669.71 --> 3672.19
yeah

3672.32 --> 3676.54
yeah that's a good one rikiya life

3679.35 --> 3687.66
now actual worms kind of prefer tree

3684.18 --> 3690.69
leaves that are slightly rotten that's

3687.66 --> 3694.41
what they prefer they like dead plant

3690.69 --> 3697.53
matter they don't necessarily like that

3694.41 --> 3700.92
flesh but eventually you know when all

3697.53 --> 3702.9300000000003
the stuff happened to that eventually

3700.92 --> 3704.94
they'll bite into it because it's more

3702.93 --> 3706.83
like the soil and it'll have like

3704.94 --> 3708.87
certain chemicals in there that might be

3706.83 --> 3711.2999999999997
interesting I don't know I think it

3708.87 --> 3714.81
takes a long time before the worms delve

3711.3 --> 3718.79
into that and you know the popular

3714.81 --> 3718.79
saying it's kind of stupid actually

3719.45 --> 3722.5099999999998
[Music]

3756.92 --> 3763.52
yeah I thought so by the way Amanda you

3760.3 --> 3766.07
yeah I hope you're doing all right

3763.52 --> 3767.5099999999998
if you hey if you want to talk you don't

3766.07 --> 3770.96
necessarily have to talk about that and

3767.51 --> 3776.42
public you know if you don't want to I'm

3770.96 --> 3778.7200000000003
I'm I'm an open air for you but yeah you

3776.42 --> 3781.67
got to figure out how to get on sky but

3778.72 --> 3784.22
we've been trying to communicate some

3781.67 --> 3790.34
over the email but seem to have a little

3784.22 --> 3793.2799999999997
trouble with mr. computer but yeah if

3790.34 --> 3800.23
you do manage to add me then you know

3793.28 --> 3804.9700000000003
you can always talk and yeah and you do

3800.23 --> 3804.97
and you do have work I thought so

3813.78 --> 3819.9500000000003
yeah and good by the way congratulations

3816.3 --> 3819.9500000000003

3838.81 --> 3851.12
yeah by the way this just won that relay

3845.72 --> 3854.2999999999997
a moment again as to how odd I feel in

3851.12 --> 3857.72
this last week it's almost now an entire

3854.3 --> 3860.29
week because remember I said like I

3857.72 --> 3865.1899999999996
changed something victory

3860.29 --> 3868.31
7th chakra has been unclamped and now it

3865.19 --> 3870.14
feels different and yet still I I told

3868.31 --> 3872.6
you back then I what I already saw it

3870.14 --> 3876.89
coming like I need to sometimes get used

3872.6 --> 3880.22
to this and I do because everything

3876.89 --> 3884.12
responds differently it's so weird

3880.22 --> 3888.3399999999997
I'm sitting here and I'm noticing that I

3884.12 --> 3892.79
have a certain lack of mechanism to

3888.34 --> 3895.34
avoid getting slight nausea because I've

3892.79 --> 3898.13
been dealing with that for a long time

3895.34 --> 3901.01
and then as that mechanism triggers I

3898.13 --> 3904.55
actually listen to my senses and like

3901.01 --> 3907.6400000000003
wait but I'm not nauseated what is going

3904.55 --> 3910.6000000000004
on it's it's like god everything's gone

3907.64 --> 3916.19
like my intestines work fantastically

3910.6 --> 3921.29
they have been this unproblematic in a

3916.19 --> 3926.0
long while and especially the no

3921.29 --> 3929.6
knowledge is stick hmm the only weird

3926.0 --> 3932.78
thing is though is that now I do get

3929.6 --> 3936.56
slight headaches but it's just like just

3932.78 --> 3941.15
feel it yeah I guess it's normal you

3936.56 --> 3942.59
know it it's like a giant wall was there

3941.15 --> 3947.0
and suddenly it's broken through and

3942.59 --> 3949.9700000000003
then there's this yeah it takes some

3947.0 --> 3953.36
getting used to especially in close

3949.97 --> 3958.0
proximity to that barrier because there

3953.36 --> 3963.76
was no energy flow there a lot now it is

3958.0 --> 3963.76
yeah headaches were bound to happen and

3967.2 --> 3970.5299999999997
it's different

3972.97 --> 3977.56
like for example I respond differently

3975.07 --> 3982.6600000000003
to cannabis now it's I don't get the

3977.56 --> 3987.13
panic anymore it's gone gone zero

3982.66 --> 3990.8399999999997
percent but at the same time I have also

3987.13 --> 3995.62
noticed that there is still some issue

3990.84 --> 3998.2200000000003
especially when I'm tired that it does

3995.62 --> 4002.2799999999997
still like in the old days does tend to

3998.22 --> 4004.89
kind of bring me open the gates a little

4002.28 --> 4007.1400000000003
bit to words my dark world memories and

4004.89 --> 4009.54
all that so I still have to be careful I

4007.14 --> 4013.7999999999997
noticed it's not like I have become

4009.54 --> 4020.7
invulnerable now so I still have to be

4013.8 --> 4023.3
careful with it but at the same time it

4020.7 --> 4027.24
typically results more in headaches

4023.3 --> 4030.8700000000003
because there is no there is no more

4027.24 --> 4032.85
fear feedback loop that used to happen

4030.87 --> 4035.85
there there was a fear feedback loop

4032.85 --> 4038.0099999999998
then like the nausea would trigger like

4035.85 --> 4041.4
a panic effect and the panic effect

4038.01 --> 4042.75
would amplify the nausea it's gone it's

4041.4 --> 4048.77
just not there anymore

4042.75 --> 4048.77
it's anyway

4051.74 --> 4062.4599999999996
Super Saiyan No Oh more well you

4059.49 --> 4065.7299999999996
remember how I think it was piccolo if

4062.46 --> 4068.37
you did that says anything to you that's

4065.73 --> 4073.02
the green guy in the in the Dragon Ball

4068.37 --> 4075.33
Z series and in Goku did it too and the

4073.02 --> 4079.59
actual Super Saiyan right they did have

4075.33 --> 4081.66
like this waits for their training that

4079.59 --> 4083.04
they will constantly wear war it was

4081.66 --> 4084.69
like in the beginning of the series

4083.04 --> 4087.0
before they even went supers and then

4084.69 --> 4090.4500000000003
you throw it off and then suddenly you

4087.0 --> 4092.37
don't have no more obstruction and you

4090.45 --> 4095.31
get more strength well that is more like

4092.37 --> 4097.38
what it is it's like Oh suddenly all

4095.31 --> 4099.6
that weight just drops off no more

4097.38 --> 4101.63
interruption no more problem holding you

4099.6 --> 4101.63
down

4107.02 --> 4110.129000000001
[Music]

4122.81 --> 4126.109
[Music]

4149.719 --> 4154.849
what

4152.359 --> 4157.089
what are you talking about more colored

4154.849 --> 4157.089
what

4166.409 --> 4168.949
huh

4178.88 --> 4186.4400000000005
ping chips what the Frick are you

4182.06 --> 4188.54
talking about anyway yeah I I don't

4186.44 --> 4194.99
think that Egypt is even that old I

4188.54 --> 4198.53
think that Egypt maybe it was even still

4194.99 --> 4205.45
around during Tartarian times in its own

4198.53 --> 4205.45
way who knows

4223.659 --> 4237.67
yeah you know what I wonder sometimes as

4227.36 --> 4242.089999999999
well if if the what would you call them

4237.67 --> 4245.21
the atheists the the Dark One's the

4242.09 --> 4249.909000000001
controllers have not literally blown new

4245.21 --> 4252.62
life actively into Egypt or like

4249.909 --> 4255.049999999999
modernized it from the ancient times

4252.62 --> 4260.03
from free Atlantean times like revived

4255.05 --> 4265.159000000001
it in later times there they seem to be

4260.03 --> 4269.36
doing it now a lot they're really trying

4265.159 --> 4271.159
to revive what they've presented as how

4269.36 --> 4273.98
it that is supposed to be I wonder if

4271.159 --> 4278.0
that is really the ancient Egypt or if

4273.98 --> 4282.799999999999
that is what they made of it to amplify

4278.0 --> 4286.54
all the the pagan elements and to kind

4282.8 --> 4291.53
of like really make it into an almost

4286.54 --> 4293.57
almost satanic religion or complete I

4291.53 --> 4298.19
don't know I don't even know all that

4293.57 --> 4303.23
much about it but I just do get the

4298.19 --> 4306.139999999999
feeling like this neo Egypt ISM you

4303.23 --> 4309.29
could call it has been actively breathed

4306.14 --> 4314.54
a lot of Aryan to revitalize it to

4309.29 --> 4316.94
rebuild it in how yeah in their image in

4314.54 --> 4320.989
their objective what they wanted to do

4316.94 --> 4325.58
with it and not truly completely as in

4320.989 --> 4327.739
ancient times they're still building

4325.58 --> 4329.719
Egypt now well yeah you could call it

4327.739 --> 4333.0199999999995
that but on the other hand you could

4329.719 --> 4336.4
also say look it may simply be a babylon

4333.02 --> 4340.34
system and egypt is another group that

4336.4 --> 4342.7699999999995
has been kind of assimilated into the

4340.34 --> 4345.5
babylon system at a later age and now

4342.77 --> 4349.820000000001
that is more the mask that the babylon

4345.5 --> 4351.53
system would prefer to wear maybe you

4349.82 --> 4354.699
could approach it like that that's kind

4351.53 --> 4354.699
of what it feels like to me

4355.389 --> 4362.889
they just you know they their face

4357.969 --> 4366.369
changes all of them that is what they do

4362.889 --> 4372.33
that is what the real controllers do and

4366.369 --> 4372.33
the grapplers face changes they update

4372.48 --> 4379.48
what they presuppose presume towards the

4376.9 --> 4382.15
outside world to be and constantly

4379.48 --> 4388.259999999999
modernize also very conveniently to

4382.15 --> 4391.589999999999
erase brutalities and sins from the past

4388.26 --> 4391.59
for power

4406.36 --> 4409.549999999999
[Music]

4442.949 --> 4460.259999999999
right this is that was that

4475.84 --> 4488.409000000001
and no no Kevin no it's not physical

4484.9 --> 4491.259999999999
body is a gift it's a gift from creation

4488.409 --> 4497.08
in order for our spirits to manifest

4491.26 --> 4501.6990000000005
annex ya experience more than we could

4497.08 --> 4509.32
just as spirits to approach it as a

4501.699 --> 4511.69
prison it's just it's just dumb that's

4509.32 --> 4514.44
that's the dark side that's our Iman

4511.69 --> 4514.44
telling you that

4518.82 --> 4526.15
it's only a prison if you make it into a

4521.83 --> 4532.6
prison or allow others to make it into a

4526.15 --> 4539.679
prison for you gotta find the key open

4532.6 --> 4543.04
that lock and turn your prison into a

4539.679 --> 4545.6990000000005
house because prison is not a prison if

4543.04 --> 4545.699
you can just leave

4554.989 --> 4561.95
all right well it sounds like yeah

4559.79 --> 4563.15
that's people with complications if you

4561.95 --> 4567.099999999999
see it like that

4563.15 --> 4571.429999999999
yeah that's Ahriman that's the darkness

4567.1 --> 4573.88
very obvious to me cuz oh yeah I felt

4571.43 --> 4578.93
like that back in the day as well I

4573.88 --> 4586.219
underwent all those angles but I know

4578.93 --> 4588.05
better now I know that is a it is a

4586.219 --> 4591.469
narrowing down of the conscious it's

4588.05 --> 4594.29
like a taint of Ahriman and weakening

4591.469 --> 4597.62
and then it starts to look and feel like

4594.29 --> 4600.41
that it's not true though this is like a

4597.62 --> 4602.0599999999995
curse and it's up to you to break the

4600.41 --> 4603.98
curse and to get out of it

4602.06 --> 4608.75
because if you're going to dwell on it

4603.98 --> 4612.62
then it's that is gonna start to grind a

4608.75 --> 4614.48
real road for you in that deviation it's

4612.62 --> 4619.3099999999995
gonna be much harder to get out of it

4614.48 --> 4623.7699999999995
then don't indulge into aromanian

4619.31 --> 4623.77
thinking it's bad for you

4637.07 --> 4647.78
what's the problem here kaylynn yeah

4643.429 --> 4650.539
what's the problem what do you think

4647.78 --> 4653.3
that seeing ghosts is impossible or as

4650.539 --> 4657.32
true be look they're sightings of

4653.3 --> 4659.96
non-physical things right I have certain

4657.32 --> 4663.13
level it's not as vividness with some

4659.96 --> 4667.4800000000005
other people yeah that's real yeah it is

4663.13 --> 4667.4800000000005
so funny to you I guess

4678.639 --> 4685.6900000000005
yeah this is not I don't know who you

4682.3 --> 4688.71
are but you don't really sound like a

4685.69 --> 4688.71
truth seeker to me

4695.959 --> 4704.959
right well Chow Yun cat well what if

4700.13 --> 4708.079
it's not just light why would you assume

4704.959 --> 4711.679
that you would literally physically see

4708.079 --> 4716.449
things when you could have non visual

4711.679 --> 4719.2390000000005
senses that can like have mechanical

4716.449 --> 4723.169999999999
interactions with your visual brain in

4719.239 --> 4727.218999999999
order to project extra visual sensories

4723.17 --> 4730.939
if you ever consider that you know blind

4727.219 --> 4733.639
people have that provably so so why

4730.939 --> 4738.01
would you assume that you could not have

4733.639 --> 4741.789
visual displays of non visual phenomena

4738.01 --> 4741.789000000001
from other senses

4760.87 --> 4772.849999999999
really oh yes sure sure given love

4767.93 --> 4780.1
thermodynamics is fake yeah who is this

4772.85 --> 4783.29
guy yeah well you know what this energy

4780.1 --> 4785.92
creation that's I get it writes the free

4783.29 --> 4788.75
energy it's free and that's really nice

4785.92 --> 4795.5
what makes you think that it's literally

4788.75 --> 4797.69
energy out of nothing what why what

4795.5 --> 4802.13
makes you think that the energy was not

4797.69 --> 4803.9
there why would you assume that it's

4802.13 --> 4807.5
literally out of nothing when that

4803.9 --> 4810.5
breaks all logic all physics logic but

4807.5 --> 4813.32
not just break it it breaks it so that

4810.5 --> 4814.79
it becomes unrepairable that nothing

4813.32 --> 4817.91
makes sense anymore because there's no

4814.79 --> 4821.24
balance there's no logic there's no more

4817.91 --> 4823.04
physical laws if what you state is the

4821.24 --> 4825.5
truth and it's not I can guarantee you

4823.04 --> 4828.56
what I can tell you however is that

4825.5 --> 4833.6
there's just a lot of energy around and

4828.56 --> 4835.88
that there may be ways to basically tap

4833.6 --> 4840.26
into that you could call it tapping into

4835.88 --> 4843.02
the ether energy into whatever it's not

4840.26 --> 4846.650000000001
free that energy is already there and

4843.02 --> 4850.160000000001
you are taking some of what is there

4846.65 --> 4853.5199999999995
naturally away and then transforming it

4850.16 --> 4857.29
into more physical energy like

4853.52 --> 4860.21
electricity but to claim that

4857.29 --> 4863.86
thermodynamics does not work that you're

4860.21 --> 4866.99
truly manifesting it out of nothing yeah

4863.86 --> 4869.509999999999
that contradicts all logic

4866.99 --> 4873.79
it makes no damn sense it's very

4869.51 --> 4873.79
short-sighted conclusion sorry

4880.51 --> 4885.4400000000005
well I masculine guard I wouldn't say

4884.96 --> 4888.32
that

4885.44 --> 4891.08
look it all just depends on what you

4888.32 --> 4895.099999999999
define as free energy free energy

4891.08 --> 4899.78
machines yeah yeah I think that is

4895.1 --> 4904.160000000001
absolutely possible in a way that there

4899.78 --> 4907.46
is mechanical devices even industrially

4904.16 --> 4910.82
so some of it was forwarded earlier that

4907.46 --> 4916.6
when you insert energy in them they are

4910.82 --> 4916.599999999999
so efficient in their process that

4916.93 --> 4922.04
despite a lot of things happening they

4919.16 --> 4925.79
literally cost no energy or even create

4922.04 --> 4928.19
kind of like a surplus and that's not

4925.79 --> 4930.74
because energy is literally created out

4928.19 --> 4934.5199999999995
of nothing but probably because of some

4930.74 --> 4936.98
geometrical aspect in how the energy

4934.52 --> 4941.18
fields are subjected to the device or

4936.98 --> 4943.5199999999995
whatever are gonna allow ether energy

4941.18 --> 4947.05
from another frequency you could say to

4943.52 --> 4950.27
touch upon it and and find a way through

4947.05 --> 4954.59
so it's not energy being created out of

4950.27 --> 4958.490000000001
nothing it's simply the ether energy the

4954.59 --> 4962.06
energy that is everywhere being tapped

4958.49 --> 4964.5199999999995
into and added on to that is what that

4962.06 --> 4966.64
is in my personal opinion pretty sure it

4964.52 --> 4966.64
is

4977.329 --> 4985.449
a sample such a device well there was an

4979.699 --> 4989.329
industrial was it machine I think it was

4985.449 --> 4992.239
it's so long ago but it it wasn't an

4989.329 --> 4995.148999999999
industrial device Assad on YouTube even

4992.239 --> 4999.308999999999
man that was like three or four years

4995.149 --> 5001.689
ago though but there's so much

4999.309 --> 5003.6990000000005
complications with with the whole free

5001.689 --> 5006.459000000001
energy movement and its really tough to

5003.699 --> 5008.469
figure out if somebody is just literally

5006.459 --> 5010.898999999999
controlled opposition trying to screw

5008.469 --> 5015.339
that movement because yeah free energy

5010.899 --> 5018.189
is the giant number one big opponent

5015.339 --> 5021.8189999999995
from the grassroots against the energy

5018.189 --> 5026.109
mafia that is a lot of grip on this

5021.819 --> 5030.969
world so yeah absolutely there was bound

5026.109 --> 5033.939
to be nut cases or literally more more

5030.969 --> 5036.459
evil people being put in there as well

5033.939 --> 5039.909000000001
to spread false claims and to make it

5036.459 --> 5041.799
messed up but that doesn't mean that

5039.909 --> 5045.369
there aren't devices out there it

5041.799 --> 5049.629
actually do take a surplus of energy out

5045.369 --> 5052.228999999999
of the ether and utilize that I don't

5049.629 --> 5052.229
see the problem

5070.229 --> 5083.159000000001
yeah I've heard of that synchronous

5072.869 --> 5084.449
motors yeah right no but that's not you

5083.159 --> 5091.138999999999
see there you go

5084.449 --> 5095.549999999999
there you go damage breaking no you you

5091.139 --> 5099.57
don't know where that came from to claim

5095.55 --> 5102.269
that energy is literally just there and

5099.57 --> 5105.949
there is no loss of energy anywhere

5102.269 --> 5105.9490000000005
that's no

5127.059 --> 5135.6990000000005
right I think that look it's it's almost

5131.92 --> 5138.76
a mechanism that you do this and it may

5135.699 --> 5141.699
be a genuine mistake from grassroots

5138.76 --> 5144.099
that a lot of these free energy people

5141.699 --> 5148.138999999999
are making and that is directly

5144.099 --> 5152.619000000001
attacking the actual foundations that

5148.139 --> 5154.329
may have some sensibility by making yeah

5152.619 --> 5156.009999999999
overkill claims saying you know

5154.329 --> 5158.32
thermodynamics doesn't work because

5156.01 --> 5160.389
there is a little extra energy and it's

5158.32 --> 5162.13
not just out of the device and then so

5160.389 --> 5164.05
they automatically claim without any

5162.13 --> 5167.079
further research as to what actually

5164.05 --> 5169.51
causes this surplus just see how it is

5167.079 --> 5171.239
there that is enough to say oh it's all

5169.51 --> 5174.639
broken yeah throw it all away

5171.239 --> 5180.308999999999
book-burning gray all of it gone yeah

5174.639 --> 5183.28
and then we're free or something no no

5180.309 --> 5185.320000000001
no you just need to do more research see

5183.28 --> 5187.9
where it's coming from what is actually

5185.32 --> 5190.75
causing the surplus what is manifesting

5187.9 --> 5197.92
that do some electrical field research

5190.75 --> 5202.719
like get some real data output as to

5197.92 --> 5205.38
what's transpiring and not just basic

5202.719 --> 5208.15
reading zero see more energy yay I win

5205.38 --> 5212.469
burn all the books no that's just

5208.15 --> 5214.329
freaking dumb and really annoying I want

5212.469 --> 5216.309
to know what actually causes it I want

5214.329 --> 5220.69
to know where the absorb less of energy

5216.309 --> 5225.25
is coming from what I know how that

5220.69 --> 5227.558999999999
happens and for example why don't you

5225.25 --> 5231.73
put on turn on one of those devices and

5227.559 --> 5235.84
get some infrared view on that or maybe

5231.73 --> 5239.44
ultraviolet view that kind of thing get

5235.84 --> 5241.389
all the data of what is happening maybe

5239.44 --> 5244.119
you could I don't know is there some

5241.389 --> 5251.079
kind of electromagnetic view I don't

5244.119 --> 5255.308999999999
know don't just start out claiming that

5251.079 --> 5256.949
the inevitable foundations of physical

5255.309 --> 5264.059
reality are not

5256.949 --> 5264.058999999999
that is an immediate lose Dom to do that

5271.72 --> 5279.869000000001
[Music]

5280.45 --> 5290.3
all right enough shut up you too sick of

5283.85 --> 5292.610000000001
your bickering stop Sivan hanging out on

5290.3 --> 5295.88
one another in my freaking chat okay

5292.61 --> 5297.98
I was actually addressing issues and you

5295.88 --> 5299.27
weren't addressing me you were Sivan

5297.98 --> 5300.919999999999
hanging out on one another

5299.27 --> 5303.31
if you do that again I'm banning you

5300.92 --> 5303.31
both

5310.55 --> 5315.02
[Music]

5331.439 --> 5336.320000000001
I'm glad some other people are actually

5333.57 --> 5336.32
paying attention

5342.26 --> 5347.7
[Music]

5360.72 --> 5370.2
yeah nobody knows how you spell that I

5363.06 --> 5372.71
made it up I guess you would spell it

5370.2 --> 5372.71
like this

5374.5 --> 5377.76
[Music]

5382.73 --> 5386.959999999999
[Music]

5384.409 --> 5389.299999999999
yeah you could just call it gamma eyeing

5386.96 --> 5395.0
out as well they were starting to act

5389.3 --> 5401.389
like gammas using a good like shut the

5395.0 --> 5404.239
[ __ ] up please I mean it don't do that

5401.389 --> 5406.79
in my chat it just makes you look like

5404.239 --> 5411.409
retards and make both your arguments

5406.79 --> 5413.42
sound like [ __ ] and I was actually

5411.409 --> 5416.12
addressing some real issues there you

5413.42 --> 5419.63
didn't even listen so yeah the next time

5416.12 --> 5422.26
you're banned you're lucky that you just

5419.63 --> 5422.26
got a timeout

5426.58 --> 5430.3
good morning Karen B

5432.47 --> 5436.3
[Music]

5433.77 --> 5439.399
yeah great show again yesterday

5436.3 --> 5439.399
[Music]

5444.68 --> 5451.81
[Music]

5460.2 --> 5467.16
oh yeah and by the way I will look into

5464.07 --> 5477.389999999999
your link I I asked you a technical

5467.16 --> 5484.4
question I think I did right right or

5477.39 --> 5484.400000000001
was it didn't oh what's that

5497.34 --> 5507.26
mm that's weird

5501.59 --> 5510.54
where did you post that I thought you

5507.26 --> 5515.81
because I remember asking you can be

5510.54 --> 5520.62
right for how did you how did you double

5515.81 --> 5527.52
livestream but I can't see seem to find

5520.62 --> 5529.8
any link to it in our Skype chat hmm I

5527.52 --> 5532.080000000001
forgot to look into it I wasn't really

5529.8 --> 5536.18
up for digging into new technology at

5532.08 --> 5539.28
the moment restream yeah yeah exactly

5536.18 --> 5541.89
because I want I want to try something

5539.28 --> 5546.05
out with that but it yeah I lost the

5541.89 --> 5546.05
link Oh anyway I'll be right back

5651.73 --> 5659.0
yeah George Sanford it's it's blatantly

5654.71 --> 5662.84
obvious that that airplanes don't use up

5659.0 --> 5666.17
that much much fuel I think that's

5662.84 --> 5668.54
pretty well-established by now that they

5666.17 --> 5673.76
have other mechanisms to save a lot of

5668.54 --> 5676.03
fuel but yeah to also then claim that it

5673.76 --> 5681.67
literally is breaking a law of

5676.03 --> 5681.67
thermodynamics no I don't think so

5687.57 --> 5697.08
not that it was yeah now why am i timed

5692.64 --> 5699.89
out hey I told you do you listen you are

5697.08 --> 5703.17
you listening to the host of the hangout

5699.89 --> 5705.4800000000005
okay I was addressing you for over five

5703.17 --> 5708.42
minutes and you just kept on gamma

5705.48 --> 5714.54
attacking that other guy okay that's why

5708.42 --> 5717.96
I timed you out what was Big Bear you

5714.54 --> 5721.04
would have been banned now for saying

5717.96 --> 5721.04
something that annoying

5756.19 --> 5759.19
yeah

5766.35 --> 5771.89
I don't really like ken wheeler I think

5769.38 --> 5771.89
he's a wizard

5775.91 --> 5783.96
like I just feel ken wheeler is bad news

5781.49 --> 5789.5
not that he's not doing interesting

5783.96 --> 5789.5
things I just don't trust him at all

5792.98 --> 5798.08
even the way he talks he just talks like

5795.75 --> 5801.0
a wizard he's just like asserting his

5798.08 --> 5804.21
sublime intelligence like a freaking

5801.0 --> 5805.98
wizard it's really annoying and it's not

5804.21 --> 5809.4
really all that clear what he says okay

5805.98 --> 5811.049999999999
I am really really freaking sharp with

5809.4 --> 5813.12
that kind of thing especially improvised

5811.05 --> 5815.400000000001
with things that I don't yet have

5813.12 --> 5817.83
grasped a lot about my intuition is very

5815.4 --> 5820.589999999999
good at that and some people may think

5817.83 --> 5823.62
wow you sound so smart

5820.59 --> 5827.64
yeah he's using a lot of smart words but

5823.62 --> 5831.8099999999995
the actual structural content sometimes

5827.64 --> 5834.21
almost philosophy level vague okay he's

5831.81 --> 5837.990000000001
not really saying brilliant things he's

5834.21 --> 5841.89
not I don't think so

5837.99 --> 5847.86
but hey he does have a couple of very

5841.89 --> 5851.46
interesting conceptual approaches which

5847.86 --> 5856.32
yeah should be heard should be kept in

5851.46 --> 5860.04
mind but then just go on to and say he

5856.32 --> 5862.83
is the leading edge authority on the new

5860.04 --> 5868.32
physics yeah you're an idiot if you say

5862.83 --> 5871.0199999999995
that sorry you're dumb you should know

5868.32 --> 5874.28
better you should see that's just too

5871.02 --> 5874.280000000001
much wizardry in there

5877.63 --> 5882.71
all right Karen B I agree his I did

5880.699 --> 5886.04
really appreciate his works with

5882.71 --> 5889.01
magnetism what I got to see so it's like

5886.04 --> 5892.79
what Nathan Oakley says who's ironically

5889.01 --> 5902.780000000001
not here like eat the meat and spit out

5892.79 --> 5905.33
the bones yeah there you go Jeremy

5902.78 --> 5909.739
I didn't even know that don't need to

5905.33 --> 5912.679
know that I didn't know it's because the

5909.739 --> 5916.159
wizard is just there it's what he does

5912.679 --> 5919.64
how he talks how he tries to sound

5916.159 --> 5921.65
really super intellectual it's wizardry

5919.64 --> 5926.650000000001
so yeah it doesn't surprise me one bit

5921.65 --> 5926.65
he's still on the ball not one bit

5936.729 --> 5943.650000000001
though yeah chou-heung cat look I'm not

5940.209 --> 5947.38
saying he is necessarily condescending

5943.65 --> 5952.058999999999
okay that's not I'm not saying he is a

5947.38 --> 5954.999
dark control or no not not that he's not

5952.059 --> 5959.409000000001
a grappler I think I think he's more of

5954.999 --> 5964.809
a blabla he just likes to fool around

5959.409 --> 5967.598999999999
and make him self seem extremely smart a

5964.809 --> 5970.03
bit over the top more that is necessary

5967.599 --> 5973.2390000000005
I don't know I I it's wizardry I don't

5970.03 --> 5977.909
like it I just don't like it and I don't

5973.239 --> 5977.909
like freaking tattoos either it just

5984.62 --> 5987.7789999999995
[Music]

5999.389 --> 6002.08
okay

6005.72 --> 6014.240000000001
hey easy on the tattoos mm-hmm no no can

6012.02 --> 6020.120000000001
be we know you're all hiding your

6014.24 --> 6021.71
witch's birthmarks just kidding no no

6020.12 --> 6035.0599999999995
but I don't like his tattoos

6021.71 --> 6039.11
I don't like it they're all - yeah esta

6035.06 --> 6042.26
- si don't seem as much artistic to me

6039.11 --> 6044.7699999999995
as they seem just freakin a cult it's

6042.26 --> 6048.5
almost like he used his his skin like a

6044.77 --> 6051.620000000001
freemason would use their their jacket

6048.5 --> 6053.78
with badges and [ __ ] that's what it

6051.62 --> 6056.2699999999995
seems like to me I don't like it I don't

6053.78 --> 6058.63
like people that do that it's very

6056.27 --> 6058.63
creepy

6085.55 --> 6090.55
what is what are you talking about

6111.33 --> 6116.18
yeah I'm listening to you right now

6113.64 --> 6116.18
Kalin

6116.84 --> 6130.2
so yeah that's interesting I'd still

6125.97 --> 6132.18
like a a slight correction from your

6130.2 --> 6135.48
earlier statement that laws of

6132.18 --> 6138.6900000000005
thermodynamics don't work because that's

6135.48 --> 6142.5
a huge mistake and I need you to correct

6138.69 --> 6148.11
that I gave you elaborate explanation as

6142.5 --> 6153.39
to why that presumption is just not not

6148.11 --> 6156.44
founded despite these findings I'd like

6153.39 --> 6158.85
to you to address that please

6156.44 --> 6161.509999999999
kaylynn true seeker free energy

6158.85 --> 6161.51
researcher

6169.71 --> 6174.46
[Music]

6187.76 --> 6194.079000000001
it

6189.829 --> 6194.079
okay Karen B it's your buddy

6204.41 --> 6209.29
[Music]

6206.15 --> 6209.29
all right

6231.369 --> 6238.5199999999995
it's terrible AGM don't talk to a lady

6237.849 --> 6242.639
like that

6238.52 --> 6242.639
[Music]

6272.08 --> 6275.08
mm-hmm

6275.23 --> 6280.24
all right so yeah you're saying the same

6278.38 --> 6284.77
thing over and over again Kailyn through

6280.24 --> 6286.96
seeker free energy so are you doubling

6284.77 --> 6291.34
down is this the hill you're gonna die

6286.96 --> 6293.53
on that actual thermodynamics laws of

6291.34 --> 6296.4400000000005
thermodynamics are incorrect is that the

6293.53 --> 6300.04
hill you're gonna die on despite me

6296.44 --> 6302.379999999999
giving you an explanation as to what

6300.04 --> 6305.82
could be going on because if you're

6302.38 --> 6310.35
gonna assume these kind of thing is that

6305.82 --> 6315.63
nothing makes sense anymore nothing okay

6310.35 --> 6323.02
nothing nothing nothing then it's all

6315.63 --> 6325.900000000001
becomes all nonsense thermodynamic

6323.02 --> 6328.39
really is what creates order here so to

6325.9 --> 6334.54
presume that energy is created out of

6328.39 --> 6340.35
nothing and not being taken away you're

6334.54 --> 6346.75
just being crazy and foolish and

6340.35 --> 6348.820000000001
unrealistic because why would you

6346.75 --> 6350.32
automatically assume that energy is not

6348.82 --> 6353.94
coming from somewhere else

6350.32 --> 6353.94
it seems so stupid

6361.71 --> 6367.06
yeah well if you're not actually

6364.12 --> 6368.68
listening to my show but you're going to

6367.06 --> 6373.05
be doing that in chat well maybe you

6368.68 --> 6373.05
should just do that somewhere else then

6384.969 --> 6391.36
oh wow okay you actually said something

6388.21 --> 6394.0
sensible there before I timed him out

6391.36 --> 6396.5199999999995
said energy isn't creating from nothing

6394.0 --> 6399.1
it is created from churning up the ether

6396.52 --> 6405.219
yeah that's kind of what I said so how

6399.1 --> 6410.1990000000005
does that disprove thermodynamics mister

6405.219 --> 6413.07
gamma it doesn't just told you yeah

6410.199 --> 6413.07
that's where it's coming from

6432.989 --> 6440.65
so disappointing what why when somebody

6438.88 --> 6445.32
actually interesting coming why do I

6440.65 --> 6445.32
have to act like a Knick and get it

6452.699 --> 6458.489
yeah anyway you just keep on listening

6455.31 --> 6462.719
your song and yeah when you're when you

6458.489 --> 6465.12
want to get serious tune into my show

6462.719 --> 6469.65
and then actually have it off mute and

6465.12 --> 6471.719
not do something else and don't start

6469.65 --> 6474.66
attacking people in chat especially as

6471.719 --> 6477.03
I'm addressing you because that's not

6474.66 --> 6486.03
acceptable this is this chat is

6477.03 --> 6494.5199999999995
interactive it's not a place for people

6486.03 --> 6497.57
to just hang out and screw around yeah

6494.52 --> 6497.570000000001
exactly can be

6525.89 --> 6528.700000000001
hmm

6544.349 --> 6550.25
Oh a gem why would you have to hide your

6547.349 --> 6550.25
mistakes from God

6558.57 --> 6563.429999999999
the whole point is that you figure out

6561.54 --> 6568.11
it is a mistake and then you're correct

6563.43 --> 6569.31
for it you can only hide your mistakes

6568.11 --> 6572.719999999999
from yourself

6569.31 --> 6572.72
not from God

6579.849 --> 6582.849
