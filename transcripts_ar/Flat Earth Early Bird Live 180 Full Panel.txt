really get to talk to other people

177.69 --> 183.69
outside of you know my own family so I

181.709 --> 187.65
clip activist other people I can talk to

183.69 --> 190.079
is really cool yeah well it's it's been

187.65 --> 193.549
a pleasure having you around a great

190.079 --> 197.37
conversationalist and you have a white

193.549 --> 200.81900000000002
view on things from what I could deduce

197.37 --> 205.769
is so far sorry if yeah I'm very much

200.819 --> 211.2
appreciated so are there any subjects

205.769 --> 213.6
you want to talk about today Oh any in

211.2 --> 215.51899999999998
particular I'd like I just figured that

213.6 --> 217.35
you had already had some set up like

215.519 --> 219.81
whatever you want to talk about I'm

217.35 --> 223.88
willing if you leave it to me I'll just

219.81 --> 227.37
be talking about D&D all day because

223.88 --> 231.69
what's the nd that's dangers and Dragons

227.37 --> 235.459
you know I read the maps so here is my

231.69 --> 235.459
slightly updated castle

237.0 --> 245.17
okay I figure that's what you were into

242.89 --> 247.98999999999998
I've never really played it before I've

245.17 --> 250.11999999999998
always wanted to but I never had a group

247.99 --> 252.10000000000002
that I could play with before right cool

250.12 --> 254.20000000000002
oh you first and foremost you need

252.1 --> 256.239
somebody capable of being a proper game

254.2 --> 261.55
master because that's a Ritz

256.239 --> 263.85999999999996
it's really tough yeah where are groups

261.55 --> 267.13
where literally the players pay their

263.86 --> 269.02000000000004
Game Master because Wow can be so much

267.13 --> 270.90999999999997
work it all depends on how the game

269.02 --> 273.13
master does it if he's just mostly a

270.91 --> 275.53000000000003
storyteller it can get really easy and

273.13 --> 278.14
it's all about skill and the dynamics

275.53 --> 280.80999999999995
between the people but some game masters

278.14 --> 283.27
are like really serious and they build

280.81 --> 286.69
props for everything every single

283.27 --> 288.49
session they and it's just and then it

286.69 --> 291.19
becomes their job that like full-time

288.49 --> 294.63
game mastering just working all day or

291.19 --> 297.52
week on the props and the story and

294.63 --> 303.27
players can pay for that that some

297.52 --> 309.07
players have a lot of money so why not I

303.27 --> 316.03
am I'm kind of in-between but I get beer

309.07 --> 319.59999999999997
and cookies as paid right and a lot of

316.03 --> 321.28
appreciation and they also helped me

319.6 --> 324.07000000000005
basically in the development process

321.28 --> 328.75
even because I'm also kind of a D&D

324.07 --> 331.21
technical designer added where I work

328.75 --> 333.28
with the rules like work on the rules

331.21 --> 337.96
themselves and the mechanics of

333.28 --> 341.55999999999995
everything the combat and the magic so

337.96 --> 344.28999999999996
yeah it is it's fast it's a fast hobby

341.56 --> 346.09
it's not small hobby so like a computer

344.29 --> 350.92
game that you're a really big fan of and

346.09 --> 354.58
play no books and books giant stacks of

350.92 --> 356.719
books for me it's PDFs mostly because

354.58 --> 362.029
yeah that would be like

356.719 --> 365.329
hyah pile books from the floor that's

362.029 --> 366.819
some really impressive all right yeah

365.329 --> 370.849
Wow

366.819 --> 372.349
wow it's amazing how long have you been

370.849 --> 374.479
doing it sorry

372.349 --> 376.989
like how long have you been doing it

374.479 --> 378.55899999999997
like how long have you had a game setup

376.989 --> 379.99899999999997
and everything

378.559 --> 382.639
well this current game that I'm playing

379.999 --> 387.46900000000005
right now is been going for at least

382.639 --> 391.689
four years and that's my second game

387.469 --> 394.159
it's [ __ ] no it's the third one right

391.689 --> 397.759
and like no one has beaten it yet like

394.159 --> 399.529
people are still playing sorry well

397.759 --> 401.569
isn't it or it it's not a game that you

399.529 --> 405.55899999999997
beat it's just it's like an ongoing

401.569 --> 408.529
thing well the players beat the

405.559 --> 410.829
challenges or go through the story it

408.529 --> 413.599
all depends on what the players want

410.829 --> 416.559
also so that there is it has to be kind

413.599 --> 419.449
of a setting thing like what's going on

416.559 --> 421.759
what is the game master like the game

419.449 --> 423.529
master can make it like horrifying and

421.759 --> 425.749
terrible and like really haunting

423.529 --> 430.519
everything if you wanted to or it can

425.749 --> 434.23900000000003
make it really mysterious and yeah and

430.519 --> 436.999
story rich in cultural rich with a lot

434.239 --> 439.489
of talking and cultures that basically

436.999 --> 442.939
could be invented trying to picture it

439.489 --> 447.529
or it could be just all about the combat

442.939 --> 449.449
and yeah just have very strategic

447.529 --> 451.909
characters and then very strategic

449.449 --> 454.55
enemies and just be brutal and hunt each

451.909 --> 456.979
other down no matter no matter how

454.55 --> 459.349
basically yeah you can go in all

456.979 --> 461.719
directions it all depends on what the

459.349 --> 465.679
players like and what the game master is

461.719 --> 468.319
willing to do but basically you can't

465.679 --> 470.899
win the game it's an ongoing thing it's

468.319 --> 474.259
an ongoing story it's like a series in

470.899 --> 476.959
every series it's usually every episode

474.259 --> 479.149
has some kind of a challenge we're kinda

476.959 --> 481.749
thing that happens or somebody that pops

479.149 --> 484.909
up and that they're confronted with and

481.749 --> 487.399
so again it's kind of the same thing it

484.909 --> 489.409
just depends like yeah are we going to

487.399 --> 490.81
have new episodes can they think of a

489.409 --> 495.02
new story

490.81 --> 497.84
you know so you have to you have to have

495.02 --> 500.35999999999996
inspiration and one way to do it is to

497.84 --> 504.44
basically invent an entire world if you

500.36 --> 508.13
have that imagination the drive to do

504.44 --> 511.58
that yeah and the way you basically have

508.13 --> 514.7
a giant theater of of puppets potential

511.58 --> 516.89
story characters that roughly have a

514.7 --> 520.219
place and as the players go along

516.89 --> 522.65
suddenly these characters spring to life

520.219 --> 526.33
and gain more depth and are become part

522.65 --> 529.49
of the story and as a matrix a

526.33 --> 534.32
holographic story matrix everything just

529.49 --> 536.48
Chris crystallizes within view basically

534.32 --> 538.22
so it's very important where do two

536.48 --> 541.4300000000001
players go if they're gonna plan to

538.22 --> 543.62
travel specific location then as a game

541.43 --> 546.4699999999999
master I hold them to it because that

543.62 --> 549.44
depends on what kind of region I'm going

546.47 --> 552.62
to have to create for them what part of

549.44 --> 554.7790000000001
the map I'm gonna have to amplify and

552.62 --> 556.279
get all the buildings to get it what

554.779 --> 557.51
type of people live there what kind of

556.279 --> 560.81
nature is that I have to get more

557.51 --> 566.93
specific about it and not so general so

560.81 --> 570.1999999999999
yeah the world spawns around them you

566.93 --> 574.6999999999999
have to build it as they as I go yeah

570.2 --> 577.7
and get consistency in it but not too

574.7 --> 579.74
much because then gets boring right

577.7 --> 582.2
cause you have to mix it up wait I'd

579.74 --> 584.63
look like like and you have to really be

582.2 --> 586.73
dedicated and passionate about like not

584.63 --> 588.65
like not just a game like especially if

586.73 --> 590.6
you're a game master and they're like

588.65 --> 591.709
that like cuz you can I can even tell

590.6 --> 592.88
the way you're talking about it like

591.709 --> 595.279
it's something that you really really

592.88 --> 597.02
like you really really love and that you

595.279 --> 599.51
cherish it it's not something that's you

597.02 --> 601.06
know just always it like it's you know

599.51 --> 603.89
it's not a casual thing it's like

601.06 --> 605.63
alright you have to really dedicate your

603.89 --> 609.529
energy to it and I think that's really

605.63 --> 613.81
cool yep some people could consider it a

609.529 --> 616.279
waste of energy but though it's

613.81 --> 620.9899999999999
therapeutical and you learn a lot and

616.279 --> 622.72
it's very high intelligence active right

620.99 --> 626.29
it's really

622.72 --> 631.89
you can throw in every amount of detail

626.29 --> 634.5699999999999
you are capable of you can muster forth

631.89 --> 637.14
it's kind of like moviemaking you know

634.57 --> 639.4000000000001
it all depends on the budget and on the

637.14 --> 641.05
brilliance of the director it can be

639.4 --> 646.41
absolutely amazing or it can be just

641.05 --> 649.4499999999999
another standard thing it all depends on

646.41 --> 651.64
how much is put into it there's not

649.45 --> 655.8100000000001
really limit because it is all imaginary

651.64 --> 658.42
all of it yeah like literally move like

655.81 --> 661.0899999999999
news TV shows all that is that's coming

658.42 --> 662.5899999999999
from someone's imagination and they have

661.09 --> 664.24
to put their effort and time into it

662.59 --> 668.2900000000001
that's something that they have to

664.24 --> 670.6800000000001
Ephesian exactly like people don't do

668.29 --> 672.4
that enough or like you know most people

670.68 --> 676.6899999999999
everybody can do that

672.4 --> 679.84
yeah everyone can little you know but

676.69 --> 683.2600000000001
for some people it's just not so it

679.84 --> 686.1700000000001
doesn't flow you don't do it all the

683.26 --> 697.3
time right or they stick to very

686.17 --> 699.91
specific dreams be great or football or

697.3 --> 702.6099999999999
something you know there's people out

699.91 --> 705.3399999999999
there that are just super brilliant like

702.61 --> 708.49
they know exactly out the size of

705.34 --> 712.39
players in their football games and know

708.49 --> 714.61
exactly like oh if like the business of

712.39 --> 717.1899999999999
the overarching companies would happen

714.61 --> 721.48
to do this or this kind of season or

717.19 --> 723.94
like even involve geopolitics then this

721.48 --> 726.339
player might become available for that

723.94 --> 727.69
group and then this combination could

726.339 --> 730.2700000000001
happen and then you would have the

727.69 --> 732.99
ultimate group dynamic like there's

730.27 --> 736.51
people out there that just know every

732.99 --> 740.05
freaking thing about that or at least

736.51 --> 744.43
seemingly so some people just blah blah

740.05 --> 749.04
blah some really do know it but they

744.43 --> 751.81
don't know a lot about other things yeah

749.04 --> 754.5999999999999
like is it's where like everyone has

751.81 --> 755.7399999999999
their own little leash like they're like

754.6 --> 756.37
something that they just gravitate

755.74 --> 758.74
towards

756.37 --> 760.45
and then they like that's why when you

758.74 --> 763.21
do have a talent like that and you have

760.45 --> 765.3100000000001
something that sure we have so much that

763.21 --> 768.07
crap stirs your interest like it's

765.31 --> 769.7199999999999
important to utilize it because they're

768.07 --> 772.75
owed that you know and then late you can

769.72 --> 774.7900000000001
connect with other people and end it

772.75 --> 776.74
like use that and then like have it grow

774.79 --> 778.54
and extend if you're just like that's

776.74 --> 780.22
the thing like if you're proactive about

778.54 --> 782.23
it then it makes a big difference versus

780.22 --> 784.39
you just digging your own little bubble

782.23 --> 785.85
like some people are more comfortable

784.39 --> 788.4399999999999
just being in a bubble and just

785.85 --> 790.57
satisfied with that whereas other people

788.44 --> 794.3800000000001
who like they want to take their ideas

790.57 --> 797.11
out and make those connections and

794.38 --> 798.97
everything like that right and if

797.11 --> 800.74
they're really wise they're gonna use

798.97 --> 805.6800000000001
the opportunities for personal

800.74 --> 809.49
development and we're testing of ideas

805.68 --> 815.1099999999999
historical scenarios because for me I

809.49 --> 817.48
use it just as an emulation it's like a

815.11 --> 820.42
historical emulation for me but yeah

817.48 --> 822.49
obviously with fantasy elements but

820.42 --> 826.51
really emulated like yeah what are these

822.49 --> 830.6800000000001
characters what as people who are they

826.51 --> 834.63
what is this world to them and it's

830.68 --> 836.8299999999999
gonna be Society so basically

834.63 --> 839.2
individuals within the societies of

836.83 --> 841.95
different groups but also the group

839.2 --> 843.85
dynamics of it all it's just massive

841.95 --> 848.8900000000001
everything that I have to presuppose

843.85 --> 851.47
basically every time in big situations

848.89 --> 852.9399999999999
when big things happened small things

851.47 --> 858.58
happens that can stick to individuals

852.94 --> 860.35
well well you like you wouldn't be

858.58 --> 862.5400000000001
necessarily presupposing it since you're

860.35 --> 867.28
making since you're crafting it yourself

862.54 --> 869.11
so so you would be knowing exactly like

867.28 --> 870.97
what's it like what these like

869.11 --> 872.65
characters are going to be looking

870.97 --> 875.47
forward to although sometimes and it

872.65 --> 876.25
like you know like because I write my

875.47 --> 877.72
own characters I have a lot of

876.25 --> 879.85
characters that I write and like I've

877.72 --> 883.2900000000001
done so many different things with them

879.85 --> 885.64
like they once they develop their own

883.29 --> 888.0999999999999
personalities even as you're writing

885.64 --> 889.81
them or writing about them you don't

888.1 --> 892.39
really know what they're going

889.81 --> 893.7689999999999
like it's like something you get stuck

892.39 --> 895.99
in you're like oh I don't want them to

893.769 --> 897.7
do this but you know they would do that

895.99 --> 899.26
it's like and then the story ends up

897.7 --> 901.51
going down a certain route because of

899.26 --> 903.31
how that character would behave so it's

901.51 --> 904.959
like they end up coming to life and they

903.31 --> 908.16
become their own people yeah that you

904.959 --> 908.16
can't really control at a certain point

909.18 --> 915.6099999999999
in Glassell later when Ash will break

912.25 --> 921.82
them and let them go through character

915.61 --> 923.8290000000001
changes right and that can be real like

921.82 --> 924.9590000000001
really hard I can like that can be a

923.829 --> 928.81
really difficult thing to go through

924.959 --> 932.14
well yeah but it keeps things

928.81 --> 934.5
interesting it can or it can completely

932.14 --> 942.88
ruin the tone of the entire setup

934.5 --> 945.82
yeah like having a happy fairy world and

942.88 --> 949.23
then suddenly getting really trim like

945.82 --> 951.7600000000001
yes okay it's not just the scary weirdo

949.23 --> 954.91
eucalyptus which no suddenly it gets

951.76 --> 958.5699999999999
really dark and sacrifices like oh [ __ ]

954.91 --> 960.8389999999999
no maybe maybe yeah never things will

958.57 --> 963.6990000000001
never be the same again basically that's

960.839 --> 969.82
yeah have to be careful with what you're

963.699 --> 971.529
planning right and eventually people if

969.82 --> 973.4490000000001
you really put out the stories people

971.529 --> 979.949
are gonna expect that kind of thing of

973.449 --> 979.949
you if it is kind of out of order yeah

980.07 --> 985.69
yeah story of writing so do you work you

983.529 --> 988.51
said you worked on characters you do you

985.69 --> 991.24
write stories or are you right

988.51 --> 994.36
absolutely yeah I do I write stories I

991.24 --> 996.67
don't not it's not public like it's

994.36 --> 998.29
mostly like with my friends like and we

996.67 --> 1001.709
have our own characters that we do

998.29 --> 1004.4699999999999
stories with together and like in one

1001.709 --> 1008.6099999999999
thing and I said we've been doing it for

1004.47 --> 1010.14
years like for a long time so so we're

1008.61 --> 1013.649
just like we set up Hangouts and we just

1010.14 --> 1015.48
do these different tests with our

1013.649 --> 1017.75
characters and everything that sounds

1015.48 --> 1021.089
extremely familiar

1017.75 --> 1022.12
it's kind of innocent I know somebody

1021.089 --> 1024.64
that

1022.12 --> 1027.929
did exactly that and they also happen to

1024.64 --> 1034.63
be a great fan of traditional Japanese

1027.929 --> 1037.1200000000001
arts and by judging by your icon well

1034.63 --> 1042.5490000000002
this is this is varma in anime actually

1037.12 --> 1047.289
yeah anime anime too but it's very that

1042.549 --> 1048.94
style so it's funny yeah yes I guess

1047.289 --> 1051.9089999999999
it's kind of I kind of fit into that

1048.94 --> 1055.0900000000001
category cuz I'm not a med like super

1051.909 --> 1057.7890000000002
crazy like I'm kind I'm kind of an otaku

1055.09 --> 1059.5
but not like heavily like oh my god I

1057.789 --> 1062.35
have to have the lace not like I don't

1059.5 --> 1064.24
have like stacks of mangas like that and

1062.35 --> 1067.51
I never really watched too many animated

1064.24 --> 1070.1200000000001
or certain ones that I really like and I

1067.51 --> 1074.62
tend to be a big fan of those alright

1070.12 --> 1080.7399999999998
yeah so so tell me what in anime do you

1074.62 --> 1083.5
find the most repulsive or annoying like

1080.74 --> 1085.659
the animes dammit that I've watched like

1083.5 --> 1087.19
numbers and I've really been repulsive

1085.659 --> 1089.8300000000002
or annoying like that like I've seen

1087.19 --> 1093.73
repose annoying anime and it'll be like

1089.83 --> 1097.6899999999998
they have these um these caricatures

1093.73 --> 1100.39
that behave a certain way they go like

1097.69 --> 1102.279
oh and I like so in some ways like you

1100.39 --> 1103.8090000000002
have some data you know yonder and you

1102.279 --> 1105.82
have all these different types of

1103.809 --> 1108.82
caricatures that behavior sort of way in

1105.82 --> 1110.8899999999999
the story and in some cases that's like

1108.82 --> 1114.01
okay it's not too bad but when they

1110.89 --> 1117.01
focus so much on making that character

1114.01 --> 1119.26
that way to put that category it drags

1117.01 --> 1121.87
the story a little too much and then

1119.26 --> 1124.539
also not so like they're those anime

1121.87 --> 1127.2399999999998
that is really poor fanservice just

1124.539 --> 1129.549
really overt and just inappropriate and

1127.24 --> 1131.6200000000001
it's like okay you yeah you were just

1129.549 --> 1134.2
really really it was a bunch of horny

1131.62 --> 1138.1299999999999
guys that made this show later but

1134.2 --> 1140.44
listen it's not oh well yeah well with

1138.13 --> 1141.64
some with some anime that is blatantly

1140.44 --> 1146.52
obvious

1141.64 --> 1146.5200000000002
yeah I'm classified in categories like

1146.61 --> 1151.0
there sometimes is a shame because there

1149.23 --> 1153.58
will be some that actually have a decent

1151.0 --> 1155.73
storyline but they focus so much on the

1153.58 --> 1160.26
fanservice that it gets annoying

1155.73 --> 1163.07
and like it's been like I've seen more

1160.26 --> 1168.5
recent anime even through Netflix like

1163.07 --> 1172.35
just look at it and it's just so fat and

1168.5 --> 1174.75
polished and it's almost like did

1172.35 --> 1178.139
actually a person write this or was this

1174.75 --> 1183.179
just graphed together by an AI or

1178.139 --> 1188.1899999999998
something because it's I don't know it's

1183.179 --> 1191.6390000000001
nothing like I my first anime no no yeah

1188.19 --> 1195.3300000000002
anime manga now it is anime animated

1191.639 --> 1201.4699999999998
animated amongst the strip right spread

1195.33 --> 1204.299
books but was Akira holy [ __ ] oh yeah

1201.47 --> 1207.3600000000001
like I could guess the two like watch it

1204.299 --> 1211.08
care before and for me it was the first

1207.36 --> 1217.049
pretty much even very serious toned

1211.08 --> 1220.6789999999999
harsh and horror horrific movie that

1217.049 --> 1223.139
just that thing echoed on enormous Lee

1220.679 --> 1225.1490000000001
and impressed me because I thought it

1223.139 --> 1229.08
was fascinating the sci-fi elements to

1225.149 --> 1234.889
it but even just that wasn't an age that

1229.08 --> 1238.47
was hand-drawn and guided by framework

1234.889 --> 1240.809
computers the models with the drawing

1238.47 --> 1243.299
but it was all hand-drawn everything and

1240.809 --> 1244.889
you can see that and they put so much

1243.299 --> 1248.22
effort and it was basically the

1244.889 --> 1251.85
hand-drawn 3d modeling in a time where

1248.22 --> 1254.76
computers just couldn't create proper 3d

1251.85 --> 1259.049
and you still see it it's just shocking

1254.76 --> 1261.87
I find it so amazing to see like you

1259.049 --> 1264.21
know it probably the the racing scene

1261.87 --> 1269.6689999999999
pretty much at the start where they just

1264.21 --> 1272.6000000000001
race like over over a curve like a

1269.669 --> 1276.3300000000002
corner and then go into a tunnel and

1272.6 --> 1279.09
then just so many moving things and it's

1276.33 --> 1280.0
all like hand-drawn 3d and just holy

1279.09 --> 1284.29
[ __ ]

1280.0 --> 1286.81
yeah absolutely incredible oh yeah I've

1284.29 --> 1288.19
actually seen like clips over here I've

1286.81 --> 1289.57
never seen like the full thing I've

1288.19 --> 1292.6200000000001
always wanted to watch the whole thing

1289.57 --> 1295.27
my friend is a really big fan of that

1292.62 --> 1297.8799999999999
movie net might like read the manga and

1295.27 --> 1299.74
everything need like he was telling me

1297.88 --> 1302.0200000000002
about it and talking about how like this

1299.74 --> 1303.85
beautifully crafted it was and how

1302.02 --> 1307.48
impressive wasn't everything so yeah

1303.85 --> 1310.7199999999998
it's still it's like even there's

1307.48 --> 1313.78
something extra glory it's like kind of

1310.72 --> 1316.18
hidden but it's extra glorious it's so

1313.78 --> 1318.34
impressive all the action things and the

1316.18 --> 1321.01
details about them it's like more

1318.34 --> 1326.74
detailed than reality the cool aspects

1321.01 --> 1332.04
it's yeah it it's it's an art and the 3d

1326.74 --> 1335.05
of my today it barely stands up yeah

1332.04 --> 1341.59
compare that although for example the

1335.05 --> 1349.27
the remake of I'm terrible with names

1341.59 --> 1352.6899999999998
about the cyborg lady it's a really was

1349.27 --> 1354.93
a cartoon ever it was an anime very

1352.69 --> 1357.8500000000001
popular and they made a movie about it

1354.93 --> 1360.94
somewhere I think I know you're talking

1357.85 --> 1364.09
about I think it goes yeah ghost in the

1360.94 --> 1367.39
shell yeah hopefully she'll yeah I don't

1364.09 --> 1374.98
know why I said go shield ghost she'll I

1367.39 --> 1378.5500000000002
heard ghost she'll shilling for ghosts

1374.98 --> 1382.02
which our secret surface so it is kind

1378.55 --> 1386.71
of true it's a ghost chill movie yeah

1382.02 --> 1391.69
but yeah I thought that movie was also

1386.71 --> 1394.0
very good like like what

1391.69 --> 1396.49
there's always complaining pants about

1394.0 --> 1401.62
it but I compared it with your rich you

1396.49 --> 1404.92
know film and that was kind of like it

1401.62 --> 1407.1999999999998
was too dark it was inhumane dark and

1404.92 --> 1409.49
everything was cold everybody's attitude

1407.2 --> 1412.94
was cold and all that [ __ ]

1409.49 --> 1416.419
and in the movie every people were

1412.94 --> 1422.0
really people and I like that a lot

1416.419 --> 1423.23
better it was really lively and people

1422.0 --> 1425.48
weren't [ __ ]

1423.23 --> 1427.34
nobody was [ __ ] and that's big

1425.48 --> 1428.8700000000001
problem in movies and everybody had a

1427.34 --> 1433.4289999999999
good reason for what they were doing and

1428.87 --> 1438.4699999999998
it's I wasn't good movie thought and the

1433.429 --> 1439.3990000000001
music oh my god the music Wow totally my

1438.47 --> 1442.97
my music

1439.399 --> 1446.1399999999999
it's like mine in the box style advanced

1442.97 --> 1450.3700000000001
techno wave ah

1446.14 --> 1450.3700000000001
melodic techno wave yeah

1452.89 --> 1457.97
like cuz I cuz I never um I didn't watch

1456.679 --> 1459.289
it cuz like there were so many people

1457.97 --> 1460.8500000000001
just talking that like my friends were

1459.289 --> 1463.279
talking negatively about the movie and

1460.85 --> 1465.32
how they has got like you are talking

1463.279 --> 1469.179
about the live-action one right yeah

1465.32 --> 1472.25
yeah they it's all watch it's much later

1469.179 --> 1475.01
2014 or something I think let me see I

1472.25 --> 1480.169
have it up Wiggum seventeen seventeen

1475.01 --> 1482.6299999999999
Levin yeah but you know this it came out

1480.169 --> 1485.99
like more recently than that because it

1482.63 --> 1487.1000000000001
was a big thing and like like oh lady

1485.99 --> 1488.45
not a lot of people didn't like how

1487.1 --> 1492.07
Scarlett Johansson was playing the

1488.45 --> 1495.98
character and everything but you know

1492.07 --> 1499.37
for me she was a great I say

1495.98 --> 1504.83
console she's a great actor actress

1499.37 --> 1506.6589999999999
yeah and to me I like was I was still

1504.83 --> 1508.789
pretty dramatic about my ex-girlfriend

1506.659 --> 1512.14
and everything and it was like really

1508.789 --> 1516.049
nice character to see to distract from

1512.14 --> 1518.3300000000002
[ __ ] see she's really sympathetic in

1516.049 --> 1522.08
that movie Wow

1518.33 --> 1524.3899999999999
hold on ghost Anisha

1522.08 --> 1526.4289999999999
I have a lot of downloaded movies when

1524.39 --> 1532.99
that was still and rather normal

1526.429 --> 1532.99
possibility nowadays it's all locked

1533.03 --> 1536.36
what other things I've been thinking

1534.559 --> 1540.02
about for a minute is like if they were

1536.36 --> 1543.049
to it was his idea about like than

1540.02 --> 1546.11
making a movie talking about let go

1543.049 --> 1548.6589999999999
talking about how the globe or model was

1546.11 --> 1550.9089999999999
created and people have kind of already

1548.659 --> 1552.0200000000002
done it but they haven't talked about it

1550.909 --> 1556.2990000000002
in the sense of it was something that

1552.02 --> 1558.71
was created as opposed to something that

1556.299 --> 1560.809
something that just existed and people

1558.71 --> 1562.8500000000001
just modeled it like like it's reality

1560.809 --> 1565.82
in people's more like like someone needs

1562.85 --> 1568.3999999999999
to make a movie like that like the

1565.82 --> 1576.4089999999999
entire conspiracy altogether

1568.4 --> 1581.98
they'll be really cool movie well maybe

1576.409 --> 1581.98
yeah but it's really difficult though

1583.24 --> 1589.309
yeah everything is big and it's

1586.909 --> 1593.8600000000001
complicated and if you basically make it

1589.309 --> 1596.3799999999999
too real and then even show how it works

1593.86 --> 1599.059
there's going to be a lot of objection

1596.38 --> 1602.63
unless you give it a twist and some out

1599.059 --> 1606.4289999999999
politicize it and and then so perfect if

1602.63 --> 1608.8700000000001
you blame the wrong person for it

1606.429 --> 1613.2800000000002
even if even if it's independent it's

1608.87 --> 1615.11
not really independent basically like

1613.28 --> 1617.87
because it like ones like if it does

1615.11 --> 1619.85
become like something that's public like

1617.87 --> 1621.6499999999999
that like kind of like how the whoa

1619.85 --> 1626.9599999999998
what's the principle independent film

1621.65 --> 1630.14
I'm pretty sure was like yeah but it was

1626.96 --> 1633.08
in there like a French documentary

1630.14 --> 1636.71
basically and they are very popular but

1633.08 --> 1639.6789999999999
it's another type of movie right they

1636.71 --> 1641.99
don't show in the regular big big movie

1639.679 --> 1646.5800000000002
theatres Hollywood movie theaters but

1641.99 --> 1650.03
it's me usually right but in film house

1646.58 --> 1652.73
things and that kind of thing that's

1650.03 --> 1654.799
where you find that or I don't know if

1652.73 --> 1656.21
it's still even if theaters or how long

1654.799 --> 1659.6299999999999
it was in theaters there was a lot of

1656.21 --> 1661.3400000000001
commotion about it yeah they were saying

1659.63 --> 1663.47
they they tricked them

1661.34 --> 1665.9499999999998
they got bamboozled like how did they

1663.47 --> 1667.419
are you talking about they

1665.95 --> 1669.49
didn't get banned like they just told

1667.419 --> 1672.22
the truth like what are you doing I

1669.49 --> 1673.84
didn't understand that like they they

1672.22 --> 1675.46
asked they were interview they told the

1673.84 --> 1678.25
truth this is what's going on and that's

1675.46 --> 1679.63
that's what happened it's not but that's

1678.25 --> 1681.49
their fault for being stupid enough to

1679.63 --> 1683.5900000000001
admit that they'd have no idea what's

1681.49 --> 1687.519
going on but they know what they're

1683.59 --> 1689.889
doing so it's like who you mad at you

1687.519 --> 1691.539
know that's why I really like how that

1689.889 --> 1694.389
movie was crafted cuz it's like it's

1691.539 --> 1696.25
showed how it showed how these people

1694.389 --> 1698.1689999999999
really think and a lot of people needed

1696.25 --> 1699.399
to see that but the people who are too

1698.169 --> 1702.3090000000002
indoctrinated of course they're gonna

1699.399 --> 1704.1999999999998
take that a certain way even like that

1702.309 --> 1705.73
knew that Newsline I'm like do people

1704.2 --> 1708.039
really feel like they were tricked and

1705.73 --> 1709.539
bamboozled or do people just not watch

1708.039 --> 1712.12
the movie because if people watch the

1709.539 --> 1713.919
movie then they wouldn't think that well

1712.12 --> 1715.6589999999999
people who just saw the headline then

1713.919 --> 1718.3600000000001
they would think oh my god they were

1715.659 --> 1723.1000000000001
tricked by these creationists geocentric

1718.36 --> 1726.519
won't look like nonsense it's like

1723.1 --> 1728.98
that's not what that was at all yeah

1726.519 --> 1733.33
yeah you're right I guess it would

1728.98 --> 1734.769
depend on how long it would take for

1733.33 --> 1737.59
these people that were gonna watch it

1734.769 --> 1740.38
before they were catching on that their

1737.59 --> 1745.059
foundational religion the globe the

1740.38 --> 1749.429
truth supposedly how it's been nestled

1745.059 --> 1751.75
in that that is being really questioned

1749.429 --> 1753.97
so as soon as I they catch on that's

1751.75 --> 1757.179
like a serious question and not just a

1753.97 --> 1758.8890000000001
conceptualization like imagine like it's

1757.179 --> 1763.26
this because then they wouldn't object

1758.889 --> 1764.61
because they're used to doing that right

1763.26 --> 1767.3799999999999
exactly

1764.61 --> 1769.299
as soon as you start claiming something

1767.38 --> 1771.1200000000001
that's really in the contrary then

1769.299 --> 1773.4089999999999
there's this instinct like wait

1771.12 --> 1775.6299999999999
something is wrong here they are

1773.409 --> 1779.3400000000001
questioning the thing that you cannot

1775.63 --> 1781.8400000000001
question and then you stopped listening

1779.34 --> 1784.809
yeah we see this with the ballers all

1781.84 --> 1786.9599999999998
the time it's like their fingers in

1784.809 --> 1786.96
their ears

1786.99 --> 1795.309
well they don't even need to they're

1792.12 --> 1798.26
there their attention is basically just

1795.309 --> 1800.72
shut off it just closes off

1798.26 --> 1802.82
because they're two pre-focus look like

1800.72 --> 1805.49
there's something really important under

1802.82 --> 1807.26
threat and I have to prepare my defense

1805.49 --> 1810.77
against that so they will stop listening

1807.26 --> 1814.76
usually oh and then yet and then they

1810.77 --> 1816.26
red herring you yeah like do you make

1814.76 --> 1818.66
you make a compelling argument and they

1816.26 --> 1820.94
say so are you saying like I'm trying to

1818.66 --> 1822.47
think of a good example like like so

1820.94 --> 1823.97
you're saying that all of science is a

1822.47 --> 1827.09
lie and that you don't believe like

1823.97 --> 1829.34
they'll do that like I've gotten to that

1827.09 --> 1830.72
was the argument that have my friend

1829.34 --> 1832.22
likes you saying you're not gonna sit

1830.72 --> 1833.84
here and tell me that all the science to

1832.22 --> 1837.08
lie and I'm like you're not listening to

1833.84 --> 1839.4499999999998
me it's not science that's lying to you

1837.08 --> 1840.98
well I thought like I did Blake say that

1839.45 --> 1844.01
over and over again she really was not

1840.98 --> 1847.04
hearing at all like it was like it's not

1844.01 --> 1849.98
science it's these men it's men lying to

1847.04 --> 1852.08
you not science it's men like didn't

1849.98 --> 1853.669
like those like she did they don't hear

1852.08 --> 1855.1689999999999
that they just hear you're denying

1853.669 --> 1856.48
science because they think that that is

1855.169 --> 1860.1200000000001
science in this but there's scientific

1856.48 --> 1862.16
about assuming a whole bunch of stuff in

1860.12 --> 1866.0
the sky that into a place that can't

1862.16 --> 1868.7
possibly you know it's just nonsense so

1866.0 --> 1870.35
it's like it being a conceptual idea

1868.7 --> 1872.3300000000002
there's something wrong with that like

1870.35 --> 1874.61
space being an idea space being it like

1872.33 --> 1877.4499999999998
an epic but the fact that we've been

1874.61 --> 1880.299
indoctrinated to think all this stuff is

1877.45 --> 1882.5900000000001
real and that we'll eventually have to

1880.299 --> 1886.1299999999999
leave the planet and go to Mars which

1882.59 --> 1887.87
doesn't make sense and in like you know

1886.13 --> 1890.39
making people believe that scaring

1887.87 --> 1893.2399999999998
people into that then this like it

1890.39 --> 1894.88
becomes then this like you tell someone

1893.24 --> 1897.98
hey you know all the stuff is bullcrap

1894.88 --> 1900.5590000000002
for me it was freeing but for other

1897.98 --> 1903.1100000000001
people they don't have so much invested

1900.559 --> 1905.72
in that mindset already then they you

1903.11 --> 1907.6999999999998
Brian oh I'm sorry it's not just even

1905.72 --> 1912.6200000000001
the mindset that's the preoccupation but

1907.7 --> 1915.2
it's also a big problem is and the

1912.62 --> 1917.9899999999998
designers of this all know this and that

1915.2 --> 1920.72
is that if somebody that's gonna teach

1917.99 --> 1924.049
you about the space university ball and

1920.72 --> 1927.679
all that lore and they're really good at

1924.049 --> 1929.809
it of really theatrical or just really

1927.679 --> 1931.46
nice people they can be just very nice

1929.809 --> 1935.33
in their social way view

1931.46 --> 1937.46
then yep that knowledge is gonna be tied

1935.33 --> 1939.6799999999998
in with that person and if you really

1937.46 --> 1942.56
like that person and somebody just tells

1939.68 --> 1947.3300000000002
you it's all a lie then you'll be like

1942.56 --> 1949.73
what he no way I really like him and

1947.33 --> 1952.24
sometimes they don't even consciously do

1949.73 --> 1956.09
that but it is an effect that happens

1952.24 --> 1960.14
knowledge usually tends to tie in with a

1956.09 --> 1962.48
teacher if if a real good teacher was

1960.14 --> 1966.0500000000002
there that would teach you that and how

1962.48 --> 1966.8
you felt with them that bond it gets

1966.05 --> 1970.52
involved

1966.8 --> 1972.8
that's it gets tested that's real and

1970.52 --> 1975.35
you get caught eventually if you get

1972.8 --> 1977.78
honest with yourself like yeah actually

1975.35 --> 1980.1799999999998
I just really did take a lot of for

1977.78 --> 1986.45
granted for him because I loved him so

1980.18 --> 1989.45
much well but can't take a long time to

1986.45 --> 1991.31
get there yeah it does take a long time

1989.45 --> 1995.8400000000001
for a lot of people and some people just

1991.31 --> 1997.8799999999999
don't want to do that at all ever and

1995.84 --> 2000.28
that's understandable like that's the

1997.88 --> 2001.63
thing like you know if you don't want to

2000.28 --> 2003.8799999999999
do that if you don't want to take your

2001.63 --> 2006.67
head there that's fine just you know

2003.88 --> 2008.2900000000002
like I'm not just don't call me my whole

2006.67 --> 2009.3100000000002
thing is don't call me stupid don't call

2008.29 --> 2012.8799999999999
me crazy don't call me delusional

2009.31 --> 2013.81
because um that's not you know that's

2012.88 --> 2016.1200000000001
not where I'm coming from

2013.81 --> 2020.71
right don't be so triggered that's

2016.12 --> 2022.33
that's basically it like exactly and you

2020.71 --> 2024.31
know you can't control people do but

2022.33 --> 2027.1899999999998
like it's just that that's what can make

2024.31 --> 2029.11
it frustrating and like I feel I just

2027.19 --> 2032.0800000000002
felt bad after that when I told when I

2029.11 --> 2034.4499999999998
was trying to talk to her and she just

2032.08 --> 2036.6699999999998
didn't she didn't want to hear anything

2034.45 --> 2038.8600000000001
else after that you know we just had to

2036.67 --> 2040.45
start talking about it and since then

2038.86 --> 2043.57
we've never talked about it said but she

2040.45 --> 2046.69
knows where my position is so it's like

2043.57 --> 2047.95
I don't know whether you know like she

2046.69 --> 2050.4700000000003
still thinks about she probably doesn't

2047.95 --> 2053.08
let her head go there until like she

2050.47 --> 2054.8199999999997
sees National Geographic or something in

2053.08 --> 2057.0099999999998
that globe and it's like oh my god my

2054.82 --> 2058.78
friend thinks that this is fake and

2057.01 --> 2062.94
they're like you know that's probably

2058.78 --> 2068.01
what comes into her head that could be

2062.94 --> 2072.03
a lot of activity here in the back chat

2068.01 --> 2074.429
never matter right

2072.03 --> 2077.039
I was wondering like if anybody else

2074.429 --> 2078.899
wanted to join but I'd love to carry on

2077.039 --> 2082.25
this conversation because you yeah it's

2078.899 --> 2088.2889999999998
a good I really like the dynamic here

2082.25 --> 2090.329
get some tea but normally it is like a

2088.289 --> 2092.6690000000003
big open panel day but yeah I'm not

2090.329 --> 2094.71
risking thrill not to think it there

2092.669 --> 2097.4
again after the porn bombing happened

2094.71 --> 2100.829
last week why do people do that

2097.4 --> 2104.099
because they're freaks like be Mars and

2100.829 --> 2106.02
when Pete Mars goes into a Fayed and

2104.099 --> 2110.0
that fey mood is too strong for him he

2106.02 --> 2112.98
will do borderline criminal things I

2110.0 --> 2118.28
just I don't understand that a little

2112.98 --> 2123.109
like it's like people just I don't know

2118.28 --> 2126.539
he's insane clinically even said it so

2123.109 --> 2130.049
yeah he sounds really it sounds terrific

2126.539 --> 2133.4700000000003
what nicely it's a manic depression and

2130.049 --> 2142.02
when he gets manic he he really gets

2133.47 --> 2143.22
crazy Wow so I don't like I'm surprised

2142.02 --> 2147.9
that he's still able to come home

2143.22 --> 2149.5789999999997
sometimes well he's just good very good

2147.9 --> 2152.039
at making new sock accounts and

2149.579 --> 2158.039
everything so you can't really keep him

2152.039 --> 2161.73
out also and to be fair overall and Chet

2158.039 --> 2163.8900000000003
he's not that menacing he's just he can

2161.73 --> 2168.359
be unpredictable if you let him get in

2163.89 --> 2170.0989999999997
the panel but he's not like a constant

2168.359 --> 2172.68
chat troll like some other people

2170.099 --> 2177.9300000000003
including certain individuals that have

2172.68 --> 2181.14
been permanently banned they just keep

2177.93 --> 2182.6699999999996
on bringing back socks to just remind

2181.14 --> 2185.6299999999997
you that they're there and know you

2182.67 --> 2185.63
can't really man me

2185.77 --> 2194.77
yeah hey Sleeping warrior chats there's

2191.02 --> 2196.9
the board yeah a lot of people in Jedi

2194.77 --> 2198.88

2196.9 --> 2203.02

2198.88 --> 2208.0

yes you know what maybe you could go

2212.53 --> 2217.63

difficult because I kind of want to get

understand that let's cool them we'll

2402.16 --> 2424.69
fight like a girl

2415.92 --> 2429.25
damn you Jessica oh god no oh yes she

2424.69 --> 2432.84
can hear you it's because the favor

2429.25 --> 2435.37
mothers are using voice meter no

2432.84 --> 2439.2000000000003
unfortunately not it didn't work out I

2435.37 --> 2441.1
tried it but totally didn't work out

2439.2 --> 2445.6299999999997
yeah I don't think this is gonna work

2441.1 --> 2446.2
for me today dude all right I'll leave

2445.63 --> 2448.48
used to it

2446.2 --> 2451.77
alright well thanks for trying no

2448.48 --> 2451.77
worries alright see you later

2454.17 --> 2463.92
although there may be a final solution

2458.16 --> 2468.1
if we could get you both in a Skype call

2463.92 --> 2470.4700000000003
how about that very cool alright let's

2468.1 --> 2479.37
try that already okay

2470.47 --> 2479.37
so drop that's right let's see

2482.38 --> 2493.199

2579.34 --> 2594.9100000000003
it's like six okay I guess I just need

2583.06 --> 2600.43
to the test I don't know why but my my

2594.91 --> 2603.0699999999997
OBS is not helping have you got have you

2600.43 --> 2606.91

2606.91 --> 2614.67
Skype but it refuses to sell yeah it

2610.45 --> 2617.6499999999996
only selects that stupid side icon

2614.67 --> 2624.52
refuses to take the main one let's see

2617.65 --> 2628.77
ah finally that took long enough let's

2624.52 --> 2628.77
see I'm gonna do this

2631.19 --> 2642.58
oh oh wait that's the wrong no that's

2639.83 --> 2642.58
silly

2647.72 --> 2655.9399999999996
right I got it yay you're visible sort

2652.55 --> 2657.829
of so visible does that mean we can hear

2655.94 --> 2659.48
each other properly right hey if you

2657.829 --> 2663.26
want you can turn on your camera and you

2659.48 --> 2664.849
will be visible hey me either one of you

2663.26 --> 2670.28
hey wait where did Jessica is Jessica

2664.849 --> 2682.849
still here yes right okay I got you and

2670.28 --> 2685.0400000000004
sorry this was kind of boring googling

2682.849 --> 2687.6800000000003
and doing weird disrupting my hangout

2685.04 --> 2692.48
but I got it back through Skype so I

2687.68 --> 2694.73
hope most can hear it Jessica if you can

2692.48 --> 2696.38
turn your mic up a little bit more even

2694.73 --> 2699.95
though it's telling you it's loud you

2696.38 --> 2702.88
know you're still pretty quiet like how

2699.95 --> 2705.56
I don't know how to do that it's like

2702.88 --> 2708.13
I'm trying I don't know how to attend it

2705.56 --> 2708.13
up any louder

2712.03 --> 2720.23
I can hear it fine in okay how do you

2717.05 --> 2724.4
know okay

2720.23 --> 2726.14
Oh little muffled it just seems like the

2724.4 --> 2731.2400000000002
the microphone is a little weak

2726.14 --> 2732.8289999999997
now but it's okay I can hear you typing

2731.24 --> 2738.6499999999996
though loudly

2732.829 --> 2746.3900000000003
sorry oh that's you no no that was me

2738.65 --> 2748.4900000000002
that was me right so Riley was up well I

2746.39 --> 2751.96
need my sound file recording if you

2748.49 --> 2755.2999999999997
wouldn't mind our win oh that's right

2751.96 --> 2758.119
you forgot yeah you wanted me to say

2755.3 --> 2760.099
something right yeah just just say I

2758.119 --> 2763.73
love you right no just say and I think

2760.099 --> 2765.829
that's the script that I gave you my

2763.73 --> 2769.849
next my next video yeah I may have been

2765.829 --> 2772.849
being a Riley she'll my next video is

2769.849 --> 2774.05
gonna be absolutely what is it basically

2772.849 --> 2776.15
I'm gonna I'm gonna demonstrate

2774.05 --> 2777.9500000000003
something within scientific method

2776.15 --> 2779.4500000000003
ballers are gonna say no you don't

2777.95 --> 2781.1299999999997
understand scientific method what

2779.45 --> 2782.3599999999997
in the afternoon here is and then

2781.13 --> 2784.46
they're gonna imply that there's a

2782.36 --> 2785.6
magical force called gravity and then

2784.46 --> 2787.31
they're going to calculate for it

2785.6 --> 2789.02
mathematically and I'm gonna say

2787.31 --> 2791.18
scientific method does not allow you to

2789.02 --> 2792.86
do that scientific method states that

2791.18 --> 2795.44
where I wiggle the independent variable

2792.86 --> 2797.0
that is the cause you can't infer that

2795.44 --> 2798.8
there's an extra cause then calculate

2797.0 --> 2800.96
for it mathematically you're literally

2798.8 --> 2803.8100000000004
going against scientific method and it's

2800.96 --> 2805.19
going to demonstrate basically how you

2803.81 --> 2808.37
know with the egg the thing with the egg

2805.19 --> 2810.59
in the water I'm gonna make them admit

2808.37 --> 2812.75
that the cause has to be the thing that

2810.59 --> 2814.4
I manipulated within scientific method

2812.75 --> 2816.05
and they're gonna have to argue against

2814.4 --> 2817.9100000000003
scientific method I'm not gonna allow

2816.05 --> 2822.8900000000003
them to infer anything it has to be the

2817.91 --> 2824.69
cause yes it's gonna start they're just

2822.89 --> 2826.67
gonna start changing science and saying

2824.69 --> 2828.29
that you don't need well they already

2826.67 --> 2829.79
kind of do that they said it you don't

2828.29 --> 2831.05
need to design thinking method to do

2829.79 --> 2836.18
science and it's like that that is

2831.05 --> 2838.1000000000004
science and they say it evolved but well

2836.18 --> 2841.8199999999997
that's ridiculous because an evolution

2838.1 --> 2846.86
is basically founded on top of what is

2841.82 --> 2848.69
already there it like I know what we can

2846.86 --> 2850.4300000000003
do here Arwen if you turn me and you

2848.69 --> 2855.4700000000003
down volume rise then that will

2850.43 --> 2857.27
effectively bring go up born it oh well

2855.47 --> 2860.0
I can't turn your volume down

2857.27 --> 2863.18
unfortunately I've just turned my volume

2860.0 --> 2869.24
down all right how can you turn yourself

2863.18 --> 2870.8599999999997
down a little bit that's off and then

2869.24 --> 2872.39
all the happens then is chap turns their

2870.86 --> 2875.63
main volume off a little bit and then

2872.39 --> 2877.8799999999997
everyone's about the same level okay

2875.63 --> 2881.54
I'll try it I'll put myself at a hundred

2877.88 --> 2882.58
and twenty instead of 140 so yeah how's

2881.54 --> 2885.86
this

2882.58 --> 2888.61
I'd say drop yours down so maybe 100 you

2885.86 --> 2891.8900000000003
so mean oh now that's gonna be very low

2888.61 --> 2895.4300000000003
okay no I want to be audible definitely

2891.89 --> 2898.67
but better okay so what did you want to

2895.43 --> 2900.56
hear me say oh we can't do on a hand go

2898.67 --> 2902.0
it needs to be recorded like later on

2900.56 --> 2905.63
I'm not gonna record it now although I

2902.0 --> 2909.08
could record it now why not it's already

2905.63 --> 2910.4300000000003
recorded on my hangout and we you could

2909.08 --> 2913.0989999999997
even rip

2910.43 --> 2915.02
this early where it show afterwards for

2913.099 --> 2917.7200000000003
the soundbite no no I can just record it

2915.02 --> 2919.309
live and literally one button if you can

2917.72 --> 2921.2799999999997
go back to the thing I gave to you and

2919.309 --> 2923.5400000000004
then the script that I said to you and

2921.28 --> 2927.8900000000003
then just read it the way that I sent it

2923.54 --> 2929.24
to you okay all right so I can do it for

2927.89 --> 2933.44
you and then you can just copy what I

2929.24 --> 2935.1499999999996
say yeah let me give it to you like this

2933.44 --> 2936.98
is what I want you to do from the

2935.15 --> 2939.2000000000003
University of Southern California the

2936.98 --> 2941.66
dependent the dependent variable is the

2939.2 --> 2943.73
presumed effect the independent variable

2941.66 --> 2944.75
is systematically manipulated by the

2943.73 --> 2948.23
investigator

2944.75 --> 2952.49
it is the presumed cause that's all I

2948.23 --> 2954.41
want to say the present because yeah so

2952.49 --> 2956.0299999999997
if you go back to the speech board where

2954.41 --> 2957.77
I gave it you in speech and then just

2956.03 --> 2960.6800000000003
emphasize the capitals that's all right

2957.77 --> 2963.41
from the University of okay again I

2960.68 --> 2965.9199999999996
can't stop I'm recording from now you

2963.41 --> 2968.3289999999997
can just cut it off any point any way so

2965.92 --> 2970.9700000000003
from the University of Southern

2968.329 --> 2973.849
California the dependent variable is the

2970.97 --> 2976.3999999999996
presumed effect the independent variable

2973.849 --> 2977.54
is systematically manipulated by the

2976.4 --> 2983.9
investigator

2977.54 --> 2987.349
it is the presumed cause be aggressive

2983.9 --> 2989.03
and emphasize the careful to perfect

2987.349 --> 2991.01
that's all I needed so I can stick you

2989.03 --> 2993.38

3014.65 --> 3019.7200000000003
you guys look you could tell they worked

3016.48 --> 3022.03
amplify the volume I know what it adds

3019.72 --> 3024.39
noise doesn't it alright write it out a

3022.03 --> 3026.349
lot of noise if I'm provider she's quiet

3095.77 --> 3101.53
I was I was speaking to slick yesterday

3097.93 --> 3102.85
oh really yeah yeah a system I says he's

3101.53 --> 3104.32
not on the show for a week I said have

3102.85 --> 3106.42
you been bonding since I've not been bad

3104.32 --> 3108.04
no he said that bronty's promise that if

3106.42 --> 3109.48
he sees me in that prehung go you'll

3108.04 --> 3111.4
snipe me at the beginning of each show

3109.48 --> 3113.65
and he said I'm a cop

3111.4 --> 3114.73
yeah I said runs he won't do that runs

3113.65 --> 3116.53
he's not allowed to do that

3114.73 --> 3118.42
he can do it but he won't do it I said

3116.53 --> 3119.9500000000003
you're welcome to join and he says now

3118.42 --> 3121.9
he says I don't want to get involved in

3119.95 --> 3123.49
the drama I said well don't talk too

3121.9 --> 3125.23
much about beliefs then just talk about

3123.49 --> 3127.54
the shape of the earth I said it'll be

3125.23 --> 3130.26
fine that's what we all do and he's

3127.54 --> 3137.44
thinking about it you might come back

3130.26 --> 3138.73
thanks he's a nice guy Rijo like it's

3137.44 --> 3141.46
just that when he was going on a

3138.73 --> 3143.26
ten-hour one was like no when he was

3141.46 --> 3144.79
going on that tangent it was annoying

3143.26 --> 3146.65
because it's like he wasn't really

3144.79 --> 3148.15
listening to anyone or listening to what

3146.65 --> 3150.01
they were trying to say it's like it's

3148.15 --> 3151.36
just like with them on like he makes

3150.01 --> 3154.8100000000004
everything personal

3151.36 --> 3157.03
yeah an anon does it but John constantly

3154.81 --> 3159.7599999999998
in flat areas like and everything also

3157.03 --> 3160.96
and it's just yeah well hey I mean there

3159.76 --> 3163.8700000000003
was a time when you took everything

3160.96 --> 3168.07
personal to the right because I was

3163.87 --> 3170.2
solely defending a concept as a single

3168.07 --> 3173.71
individual and it's like really

3170.2 --> 3174.8199999999997
important and I'm glad that I did it it

3173.71 --> 3176.71
made you stronger in the end though

3174.82 --> 3179.92
right exactly we learn from it

3176.71 --> 3181.599
right and now I know what gravity is and

3179.92 --> 3186.309
what it is not you're still confused

3181.599 --> 3189.04
about it right okay I don't think I'm

3186.309 --> 3189.6090000000004
confused I just it's just not it's not a

3189.04 --> 3191.17
thing

3189.609 --> 3192.91
I know what they tell us it's supposed

3191.17 --> 3194.29
to be I know what they tell us it's

3192.91 --> 3195.97
supposed to be that they can't prove or

3194.29 --> 3197.23
expect us and demand that we believe it

3195.97 --> 3202.0299999999997
because they say it's true and science

3197.23 --> 3205.45
proves it but it doesn't mm-hmm because

3202.03 --> 3207.19
everything falling at one rate and like

3205.45 --> 3209.6499999999996
it the only time you see that effect is

3207.19 --> 3211.829
inside of a vacuum and even inside of

3209.65 --> 3214.02
the vacuum to assume that there is a

3211.829 --> 3217.15
specific thing that is doing that

3214.02 --> 3219.64
specific type of thing like it's it's

3217.15 --> 3221.17
just no I don't even get what point

3219.64 --> 3222.67
they're trying to make with it I mean so

3221.17 --> 3224.41
what everything falls like a certain

3222.67 --> 3226.059
rate in a vacuum well that's because

3224.41 --> 3227.8289999999997
you've got no medium for it to react

3226.059 --> 3228.7900000000004
against you know why does it follow that

3227.829 --> 3230.8590000000004
resistance

3228.79 --> 3233.109
yeah the resistance the interaction of

3230.859 --> 3235.14
medium yes is affecting its rate that

3233.109 --> 3239.71
they fall but it's not it's mostly about

3235.14 --> 3242.65
the presence of acceleration what that

3239.71 --> 3244.78
is again it is a distance thing a

3242.65 --> 3249.04
distance over time thing so it is a

3244.78 --> 3252.13
deduction that's what it just happens

3249.04 --> 3254.92
this is like that it's the falling rate

3252.13 --> 3256.69
the falling rate and that is kind of

3254.92 --> 3260.5
like a foundation of the presupposition

3256.69 --> 3262.299
of gravity it's so is it proof that

3260.5 --> 3264.19
there is something out there because you

3262.299 --> 3266.71
can presuppose that if there is a force

3264.19 --> 3269.319
disequilibrium present at all time that

3266.71 --> 3272.23
that could be the cause the reason of

3269.319 --> 3276.16
all things displacing through normally

3272.23 --> 3277.809
relative density so yeah other Meekins

3276.16 --> 3280.859
just recorded a sound file and sent it

3277.809 --> 3283.63
to me so shout out started making cool

3280.859 --> 3286.14
no I understand all that I totally

3283.63 --> 3289.089
understand that but like like on the

3286.14 --> 3290.74
problem is is that people are still

3289.089 --> 3292.75
looks tributing that necessarily with

3290.74 --> 3295.39
some type of outside force and it's not

3292.75 --> 3298.059
something outside that's making the

3295.39 --> 3300.3089999999997
object do that it's the objects it's the

3298.059 --> 3302.829
weight of the object itself all

3300.309 --> 3304.9300000000003
resisting the fall that's causing that

3302.829 --> 3307.4100000000003
happen like that's what's causing the

3304.93 --> 3310.7999999999997
acceleration like for what I've observed

3307.41 --> 3313.2999999999997
no no no but that's not too

3310.8 --> 3315.67
even in a vacuum there's still

3313.3 --> 3318.04
acceleration from a steel standpoint

3315.67 --> 3321.82
that's just how force for house opposed

3318.04 --> 3325.5099999999998
force works but it's the main issue is

3321.82 --> 3327.31
is the presumed origin of the force and

3325.51 --> 3329.6800000000003
what gravity says is that there is a

3327.31 --> 3333.52
force field a constant force at all

3329.68 --> 3335.1099999999997
times on everything uniformly and yeah

3333.52 --> 3338.29
then you get the mass attract the mass

3335.11 --> 3342.34
and it becomes over the top complicated

3338.29 --> 3344.02
and crazy but basically the origins is a

3342.34 --> 3348.13
presupposition that there is a force

3344.02 --> 3350.83
field present while practically we just

3348.13 --> 3352.78
know that yeah

3350.83 --> 3355.45
because of relative density that this

3352.78 --> 3357.3100000000004
equilibrium is actually what manifests

3355.45 --> 3360.0099999999998
the force what manifests the

3357.31 --> 3362.1
displacement as soon it is the

3360.01 --> 3363.9100000000003
disequilibrium is funny to me

3362.1 --> 3367.6
mathematically because I can see a

3363.91 --> 3372.58
direct correlation relative density this

3367.6 --> 3375.1
equilibrium force this equilibrium so

3372.58 --> 3377.62
that closes that loop there is literally

3375.1 --> 3383.17
no mechanical necessity for a uniform

3377.62 --> 3385.6
field force that's what I'm okay I see

3383.17 --> 3389.02
so we're on the same page so I get what

3385.6 --> 3392.0499999999997
they're signing and then and then like

3389.02 --> 3393.85
the whole mass subtracting mass thing

3392.05 --> 3394.9900000000002
that's something that we that's the

3393.85 --> 3397.0
whole point it's like it's supposed to

3394.99 --> 3399.3999999999996
be this feel that's like they describe

3397.0 --> 3402.25
it's like a confusion of gravitation

3399.4 --> 3404.44
with mag magnets with magnets eight like

3402.25 --> 3406.48
that's what it sounds like it's like but

3404.44 --> 3408.04
but all the objects are attracted to

3406.48 --> 3410.13
each other because their mass and it's

3408.04 --> 3412.84
like that sounds like Oh

3410.13 --> 3417.88
enak that I'm not using the right word I

3412.84 --> 3419.4700000000003
mean yes magnetic magnetic fields and

3417.88 --> 3422.1400000000003
that's something that does exist but

3419.47 --> 3424.54
that's the positive and negative charges

3422.14 --> 3425.74
of that there's something completely

3424.54 --> 3427.48
different than what they describe

3425.74 --> 3429.1899999999996
gravity to be is just something of a

3427.48 --> 3430.75
bigger mass attracting a small amount

3429.19 --> 3435.55
which is something that's never observed

3430.75 --> 3438.49
ever and make it so like that's and then

3435.55 --> 3441.07
like even Einstein's concept the

3438.49 --> 3443.5
curvature of space-time that that just

3441.07 --> 3446.54
never it was like what

3443.5 --> 3448.61
whatever started but but they're saying

3446.54 --> 3452.32
but there's still confusion about that

3448.61 --> 3458.09
and that's widespread and that is

3452.32 --> 3461.6600000000003
Einstein never really replaced never

3458.09 --> 3464.8700000000003
gravity never did that he just tried to

3461.66 --> 3467.72
fictionalize a cause and then expand

3464.87 --> 3469.8199999999997
greatly upon this with the heliocentric

3467.72 --> 3471.73
system that did you just say the

3469.82 --> 3474.9500000000003
Einstein didn't replace Newton

3471.73 --> 3478.22
technically he didn't he just nobody

3474.95 --> 3481.52
nobody instead of the supposed

3478.22 --> 3484.58
mysterious origin of gravity why does it

3481.52 --> 3487.1
hurt that it then presupposes another

3484.58 --> 3489.62
cause for it that's when we didn't you

3487.1 --> 3491.15
didn't lead agna Clery removed now yeah

3489.62 --> 3492.17
I know the crowd you've said it a

3491.15 --> 3496.4
thousand times

3492.17 --> 3498.56
no no that's another heliocentric going

3496.4 --> 3500.75
to shift the narrative listen

3498.56 --> 3502.79
he removed gravity as a force and he

3500.75 --> 3505.13
replaced it as the effect of the

3502.79 --> 3507.62
curvature of space-time in other words

3505.13 --> 3509.42
the curved path wasn't caused by gravity

3507.62 --> 3512.0299999999997
it was caused by the fabric of space

3509.42 --> 3513.83
bang the light that aligned straight is

3512.03 --> 3515.21
the fabric of space-time yeah and then

3513.83 --> 3518.0299999999997
even as you after it

3515.21 --> 3520.91
it is a straw man literally it is a

3518.03 --> 3523.5800000000004
literal straw man it isn't yes it is

3520.91 --> 3525.71
because it doesn't it just says no it's

3523.58 --> 3528.3199999999997
not a force and then it proceeds in

3525.71 --> 3530.09
talking about another field yeah so if

3528.32 --> 3532.76
he says it's not a forceful new but

3530.09 --> 3535.9700000000003
without actually elaborating on it it

3532.76 --> 3538.55
just says out of the no doesn't say why

3535.97 --> 3539.0899999999997
it just read here it's you to something

3538.55 --> 3542.7200000000003
else

3539.09 --> 3545.63
see it's her interest misleading things

3542.72 --> 3547.1899999999996
it does red herring you into something

3545.63 --> 3550.2200000000003
else you're right but it did replace

3547.19 --> 3552.92
Newton's force with someone else in it

3550.22 --> 3555.23
yeah clean all right sailor claim by

3552.92 --> 3560.6800000000003
that person that in that sentence is red

3555.23 --> 3565.03
herring you this it's look it's a

3560.68 --> 3567.8599999999997
cultural annotation it's not really

3565.03 --> 3569.63
scientific data it's just a saying well

3567.86 --> 3572.27
what is the scientific evidence of any

3569.63 --> 3576.9900000000002
of it see it's it's just heliocentric

3572.27 --> 3581.7599999999998
speculation to move the science culture

3576.99 --> 3584.64
to shift the narrative it doesn't

3581.76 --> 3587.19
replace it it just presupposes what

3584.64 --> 3589.65
actually is at the foundational core of

3587.19 --> 3592.71
it it did reflects our when all of the

3589.65 --> 3594.63
teachings say that yeah make any sense

3592.71 --> 3596.9700000000003
that it says that because it technically

3594.63 --> 3597.57
doesn't it's not our problem is that's

3596.97 --> 3602.7599999999998
what they teach

3597.57 --> 3603.9
I don't agree any sense well it doesn't

3602.76 --> 3605.3100000000004
matter whether it makes sense or not

3603.9 --> 3607.4100000000003
it's what they're teaching is this

3605.31 --> 3609.2999999999997
supposed to be gravity right there every

3607.41 --> 3611.339
time you repeat that you are literally

3609.3 --> 3614.4
repeating something that doesn't make

3611.339 --> 3617.49
any sense well it's what I teaches is

3614.4 --> 3619.7400000000002
that I know but just pointing it out you

3617.49 --> 3623.8199999999997
know may I say something

3619.74 --> 3625.2
yes of course like would you say that

3623.82 --> 3628.23
even like what they did was that they

3625.2 --> 3629.39
try to it's it like from what I from

3628.23 --> 3632.73
what I understand

3629.39 --> 3635.22
Einstein's concepts had to be invented

3632.73 --> 3638.46
in order to explain what's happening to

3635.22 --> 3640.83
in the sky to the planets as a versus um

3638.46 --> 3643.38
because Newton's Newton's law of

3640.83 --> 3645.359
gravitation quote-unquote like his his

3643.38 --> 3647.67
explanations didn't match up to what was

3645.359 --> 3649.7999999999997
going on with the planets why hence

3647.67 --> 3652.71
where it could anywhere in the world

3649.8 --> 3655.65
sorry sorry friend but yeah his model

3652.71 --> 3659.25
was only for the world yes basically

3655.65 --> 3662.79
still geo sentries space universe wasn't

3659.25 --> 3665.82
that elaborated upon yet most of that

3662.79 --> 3669.38
has been spawned in the 20th century in

3665.82 --> 3672.349
the minds of people most I hate Jessica

3669.38 --> 3677.2400000000002
yes does your offer still stand for a

3672.349 --> 3679.8300000000004
speech there's my work with who and how

3677.24 --> 3682.3799999999997
does your offer still stand up for a

3679.83 --> 3684.27
speech my offer still stands for a

3682.38 --> 3686.4900000000002
speech well now that your volumes cuz

3684.27 --> 3687.9
you've moved your mic closer I'm looking

3686.49 --> 3689.25
at where your levels are bouncing now

3687.9 --> 3690.69
and I can see that I could get a

3689.25 --> 3693.14
recording off you if I was to send you

3690.69 --> 3695.31
the file I want it to read uh okay sure

3693.14 --> 3696.18
cool we can do this right now because

3695.31 --> 3698.31
I'll give me another one

3696.18 --> 3704.06
all right I will send you C file it's

3698.31 --> 3707.13
number ten okay let me open make sure

3704.06 --> 3708.71
I'm gonna add you to the early bird chat

3707.13 --> 3712.7000000000003
yes

3708.71 --> 3715.38
cool boo definitely deserve that

3712.7 --> 3719.43
Riley do you wanna do you want back in

3715.38 --> 3721.349
since you using it is is the one

3719.43 --> 3723.359
particular disinformation agent in there

3721.349 --> 3726.1800000000003
we both know who I'm referring to now

3723.359 --> 3731.22
Nora's not in here anymore I think okay

3726.18 --> 3733.7999999999997
then I made you naked yeah now she's

3731.22 --> 3737.04
just very tied to her personal

3733.8 --> 3738.599
convictions she's - she's too influenced

3737.04 --> 3741.99
by our stott what's the problem harissa

3738.599 --> 3743.4900000000002
like Aristotle philosophical science is

3741.99 --> 3746.1299999999997
not empirical science but she still

3743.49 --> 3746.7599999999998
believes it and not married to him in a

3746.13 --> 3748.8900000000003
past life

3746.76 --> 3750.5400000000004
yeah she studied in my school at some

3748.89 --> 3751.859
point in maybe college or whatever and

3750.54 --> 3753.66
because she's got an affiliation with

3751.859 --> 3755.25
him she feels that that he's the way and

3753.66 --> 3760.0989999999997
I get it I understand that there's a

3755.25 --> 3764.49
personal vested interest in it but well

3760.099 --> 3768.42
can you see that's right I can let me

3764.49 --> 3772.77
click on this okay it's so blurry yeah

3768.42 --> 3775.41
it will improve okay all I see is

3772.77 --> 3777.359
independent variable I don't super oh

3775.41 --> 3778.47
you don't see the text wrong I'll tell

3777.359 --> 3784.02
you what I'll type it out so that you

3778.47 --> 3786.68
meet so that you can see it I love

3784.02 --> 3786.68
reading things

3806.359 --> 3818.5789999999997
silence hello yeah I'm still here I'm

3816.45 --> 3820.4399999999996
just waiting for and I'm just I'm just

3818.579 --> 3821.88
thinking out so I'm just copying this

3820.44 --> 3823.89
down just give me a sec all right all

3821.88 --> 3828.75
right

3823.89 --> 3829.65
let's see I'll take a look at Chet I

3828.75 --> 3831.78
never did that

3829.65 --> 3836.549
it's so silly I wasn't gonna do it and

3831.78 --> 3839.309
then I forgot okay I wasn't able to eat

3836.549 --> 3842.94
right yeah but because Riley popped it

3839.309 --> 3844.44
all of a sudden forgot so yeah hello I

3842.94 --> 3846.66
owe the first part is even caught up

3844.44 --> 3849.299
okay so I'm just gonna go to where it

3846.66 --> 3857.73
comes invisible hello Voynich over

3849.299 --> 3861.5099999999998
McCall Steve X 320 James mace the atom

3857.73 --> 3872.73
meek and of course and Riley does Studio

3861.51 --> 3880.26
68 they haven't read tome annoyed its

3872.73 --> 3885.03
McLeod they lie Ohio PJ okay those pops

3880.26 --> 3887.119
by alright so let me read it first and

3885.03 --> 3889.3190000000004
then basically didn't copy what I say

3887.119 --> 3894.839
this cool

3889.319 --> 3897.44
sorry I thought you'd finished no no the

3894.839 --> 3901.5
problem is I got a lot of people in chat

3897.44 --> 3903.15
Ryan Etherton but I'm scrolling through

3901.5 --> 3905.609
it because in the list it doesn't show

3903.15 --> 3909.809
everyone so this just doesn't really

3905.609 --> 3911.7599999999998
work so flat enough ribbon to to shout

3909.809 --> 3918.17
out to David Weiss I've just got a sound

3911.76 --> 3920.099
file oh cool David never pops by yet

3918.17 --> 3923.16
he must be listening because he's

3920.099 --> 3924.21
reacted really it's breakfast time for

3923.16 --> 3925.6189999999997
that he's probably got your on in the

3924.21 --> 3926.339
background so shout out to David one

3925.619 --> 3928.44
okay cool

3926.339 --> 3930.27
although we because if David Weiss was

3928.44 --> 3933.21
listening

3930.27 --> 3936.6
oh yeah I I would love to like talk to

3933.21 --> 3938.85
him like he's like a like a celebrity in

3936.6 --> 3940.29
my head so he's the uncle that is the

3938.85 --> 3940.71
uncle everybody wants to laugh though

3940.29 --> 3943.71
right

3940.71 --> 3946.8
indeed yeah and I I totally like him but

3943.71 --> 3950.58
I am definitely gonna keep on pestering

3946.8 --> 3953.9100000000003
him about the holographic nature of the

3950.58 --> 3956.2799999999997
Sun like that thing started out with me

3953.91 --> 3960.45
and like he didn't like that I led that

3956.28 --> 3962.28
I tested his Sun moving in a circle over

3960.45 --> 3964.83
the earth concept he didn't like that at

3962.28 --> 3968.61
all so I gonna keep on challenging him

3964.83 --> 3970.08
about it I did like I agree with that

3968.61 --> 3971.94
concept because that's kind of that's

3970.08 --> 3975.18
kind of what we observed like there's a

3971.94 --> 3976.65
pattern does the Sun go that then that

3975.18 --> 3978.1499999999996
changes throughout the year and

3976.65 --> 3980.7000000000003
everything like that and that's what

3978.15 --> 3982.77
basically what we see so I kind of I see

3980.7 --> 3984.1499999999996
where that concept would come from but I

3982.77 --> 3987.66
am curious to hear about your

3984.15 --> 3991.5
holographic I don't think I've really

3987.66 --> 3994.1099999999997
heard it before right yeah okay well the

3991.5 --> 3996.63
proof it's a very elaborate thing look I

3994.11 --> 3998.88
conceptualize the entire globe of the

3996.63 --> 4000.56
heavens as I call it all the celestial

3998.88 --> 4003.56
lights including the moon and the Sun

4000.56 --> 4006.67
everything that is light I conceptualize

4003.56 --> 4009.17
it as holographic in nature and that

4006.67 --> 4011.6
basically comes down to that none of

4009.17 --> 4016.04
these lights are in any physical literal

4011.6 --> 4020.109
position things shining down on you it's

4016.04 --> 4025.04
all lights that basically manifest

4020.109 --> 4028.67
personally based on the the individual

4025.04 --> 4031.22
observers position and depending on that

4028.67 --> 4033.8
the light manifests in a certain way in

4031.22 --> 4037.22
relation to that position and that is

4033.8 --> 4040.67
how we see it and that exactly like the

4037.22 --> 4043.73
Sun and it just happens to follow a

4040.67 --> 4045.5
certain kind of pattern where if you

4043.73 --> 4048.41
presuppose that the earth Flat Earth is

4045.5 --> 4051.23
a disc that it you would imagine it to

4048.41 --> 4054.29
be in a specific place roughly 3,000

4051.23 --> 4056.09
meter high but that's a on based on the

4054.29 --> 4059.81
presupposition that the Flat Earth is

4056.09 --> 4063.01
literally a disc and that is kind of

4059.81 --> 4066.43
lent borrowed from

4063.01 --> 4068.53
the the Gleason's map the yeah the

4066.43 --> 4071.14
flatter disc math but that's not a

4068.53 --> 4073.48
literal flat map it's not a model it's a

4071.14 --> 4078.5099999999998
projection it's a map projection so it

4073.48 --> 4081.4900000000002
the earth is not literally like that so

4078.51 --> 4084.19
there's where the presupposition of the

4081.49 --> 4087.52
Sun being literally in a circle over us

4084.19 --> 4090.76
basically breaks up there are like there

4087.52 --> 4093.0099999999998
are cultures who also do describe the

4090.76 --> 4095.65
earth as a flat disc even before the

4093.01 --> 4097.33
young I know it's not like yeah if

4095.65 --> 4101.29
you're gonna if you're gonna show it

4097.33 --> 4104.08
somehow in a picture yeah you're gonna

4101.29 --> 4106.839
have to be able to do that and if the

4104.08 --> 4109.0289999999995
whole thing is weird and warped and

4106.839 --> 4114.85
spatially nonlinear however how could

4109.029 --> 4119.89
you ever show that in a way that normal

4114.85 --> 4122.56
people would understand Earth see so

4119.89 --> 4124.4800000000005
that's why I think that every culture

4122.56 --> 4129.150000000001
basically stuck to the disk because it's

4124.48 --> 4132.6089999999995
the easiest it's it's the easiest way to

4129.15 --> 4135.0289999999995
conceptualize it that is the most close

4132.609 --> 4139.54
to the truth as you can get without

4135.029 --> 4141.839000000001
really testing your intelligence well

4139.54 --> 4144.16
it's kind of like a thing where people

4141.839 --> 4146.41
imagine like how God would make the

4144.16 --> 4147.88
world would look like you know like but

4146.41 --> 4151.66
you can't really imagine that you'd have

4147.88 --> 4151.81
to ask you know God Himself how he did

4151.66 --> 4154.0599999999995
it

4151.81 --> 4157.39
like you know like oh that was on

4154.06 --> 4159.25
Pythagoras's problem like - thought the

4157.39 --> 4161.7390000000005
earth was a sphere because spheres is

4159.25 --> 4164.08
such a perfect shape and everything so

4161.739 --> 4166.599999999999
that's like that's where like his idea

4164.08 --> 4168.94
came from to have a globe to have a

4166.6 --> 4171.52
spherical earth basically yeah but the

4168.94 --> 4172.719999999999
word sphere didn't come into vocabulary

4171.52 --> 4174.790000000001
until quite recently

4172.72 --> 4177.609
it wasn't very back in the day when he

4174.79 --> 4180.43
was around yeah you know like the like a

4177.609 --> 4182.589
round shape that likes Providence a

4180.43 --> 4184.21
sphere you know but you know I wonder

4182.589 --> 4186.0689999999995
how is the Aristophanes knew the earth

4184.21 --> 4188.859
was spherical when back in the day he

4186.069 --> 4190.72
was 250 years before Christ and the ball

4188.859 --> 4192.4890000000005
is don't accept that Christ even existed

4190.72 --> 4193.12
but they do accept that Aristophanes

4192.489 --> 4195.129999999999
existed

4193.12 --> 4196.28
there's no references for Aristophanes

4195.13 --> 4198.26
existing other than inside

4196.28 --> 4200.66
the pseudoscience what Christ has got

4198.26 --> 4202.43
thousands of first hand citations from

4200.66 --> 4204.32
firsthand witness testimony of things

4202.43 --> 4206.66
that he's done said walked across done

4204.32 --> 4208.3099999999995
whatever and they dismiss all that and

4206.66 --> 4210.44
but they do believe this bloke called

4208.31 --> 4213.26
Aristophanes and let's not forget they

4210.44 --> 4215.57
walked round and rolled camels to get

4213.26 --> 4217.13
across the land yes somehow he knew that

4215.57 --> 4221.9
the earth was a sphere before Christ

4217.13 --> 4223.61
mm-hmm and was able to measure the and

4221.9 --> 4226.219999999999
even what's so stupid is that even

4223.61 --> 4227.719999999999
though don't you know when Neil deGrasse

4226.22 --> 4229.46
Tyson was talking about it even though

4227.72 --> 4232.25
explanation it can both of those

4229.46 --> 4233.9
explanation can be explained on if the

4232.25 --> 4235.91
earth was flat or if it was a sphere so

4233.9 --> 4238.04
there was no point in even like

4235.91 --> 4241.58
asserting that and then like the

4238.04 --> 4244.7
realistic aspect of it like how would he

4241.58 --> 4247.1
have had all that time to wait for the

4244.7 --> 4249.38
Sun to be zenith where he was and for it

4247.1 --> 4251.120000000001
also to be zenith in the other place you

4249.38 --> 4253.1900000000005
have a location and he went to that's

4251.12 --> 4255.83
almost impossible it's a very rare

4253.19 --> 4257.419999999999
occurrence so it's like the fact that he

4255.83 --> 4260.36
yeah it doesn't make any sense the story

4257.42 --> 4261.68
sounds you know like and there's no

4260.36 --> 4263.66
other records of him doing anything

4261.68 --> 4267.610000000001
after that so it's nonsense basically

4263.66 --> 4269.54
can we try recording this chocolate yeah

4267.61 --> 4271.58
all right so all the what needs to do

4269.54 --> 4273.38
I'll read it for you first and then you

4271.58 --> 4276.62
just copy what I say the way I say and

4273.38 --> 4277.79
then that works by saying Singh Kham the

4276.62 --> 4280.099999999999
independent variable is the variable

4277.79 --> 4282.62
that the scientist changes during the

4280.1 --> 4284.6
experiment think of the experiments as a

4282.62 --> 4287.75
cause-and-effect exercise the

4284.6 --> 4289.58
independent variable is the cause factor

4287.75 --> 4292.82
if you can do it like that that's what I

4289.58 --> 4295.4
want I don't know he record it I say

4292.82 --> 4297.32
wait wait say by sciencing that guy yeah

4295.4 --> 4298.969999999999
cuz in referencing it is yes or start

4297.32 --> 4300.71
literally war fought in speech there in

4298.97 --> 4303.320000000001
the speech marks just say by saying

4300.71 --> 4304.58
Singh Kham the independent variable and

4303.32 --> 4311.78
read it the way I just did it like that

4304.58 --> 4313.94
and I'll be - I'll be perfect okay by

4311.78 --> 4315.71
science Singh Kham the independent

4313.94 --> 4318.169999999999
variable is the variable that the

4315.71 --> 4320.42
scientist changes during the experiment

4318.17 --> 4322.85
think of the experiments as they cause

4320.42 --> 4327.22
and effect exercise the independent

4322.85 --> 4327.22
variable is the cause factor

4328.559 --> 4334.92
perfect like we don't nicely dump that

4332.159 --> 4338.219
let me dump that into the sound line and

4334.92 --> 4339.63
that's pretty much me down there what

4338.219 --> 4342.199
what a bit of reverb going through there

4339.63 --> 4345.27
hang on yeah that's you going not me

4342.199 --> 4348.239
well clearly I don't have any content

4345.27 --> 4350.789000000001
there so within the chats my channel is

4348.239 --> 4353.159
I don't have any content so that's okay

4350.789 --> 4355.73
what kind of music are you gonna put in

4353.159 --> 4359.429
the background like really mellow guitar

4355.73 --> 4360.629999999999
or something or I don't know sometimes I

4359.429 --> 4362.1900000000005
put music in sometimes that don't

4360.63 --> 4369.539
depends on but I was serious I want it

4362.19 --> 4378.719
to be put in something really bombastic

4369.539 --> 4380.73
classical it's like do the Valkyries by

4378.719 --> 4386.429
uh what's his name I forgot the name

4380.73 --> 4389.73
would a composer Wagner something do

4386.429 --> 4392.88
that that'd be too comical though it

4389.73 --> 4394.949
sounds and I could sit like what's so

4392.88 --> 4396.84
sad as I could tell what he made that he

4394.949 --> 4400.98
wasn't attending on it to be comical but

4396.84 --> 4407.75
it just like it's just about being used

4400.98 --> 4411.539
that way later on sorry we talked to me

4407.75 --> 4415.28
but I was talking in general so I was

4411.539 --> 4415.28
just lining these these clips OPA

4420.12 --> 4434.46
[Music]

4422.27 --> 4437.34
perfect I can't wait to see the end

4434.46 --> 4439.02
result of this project of yours oh it's

4437.34 --> 4441.09
gonna be really good it's gonna be call

4439.02 --> 4443.7300000000005
see what it's tactical as well on this

4441.09 --> 4445.53
because it's gonna be a big video it's

4443.73 --> 4447.629999999999
not just gonna be me talking it's gonna

4445.53 --> 4449.34
be like lots of people talking so what

4447.63 --> 4451.38
that does is it means that the awareness

4449.34 --> 4453.059
within the community people on our side

4451.38 --> 4454.32
should listen to the voices that are in

4453.059 --> 4456.75
here because they'll recognize a lot

4454.32 --> 4458.61
other voices on the ball outside it'll

4456.75 --> 4460.079
show that like people on our side are

4458.61 --> 4461.88
getting the message and they're like

4460.079 --> 4465.75
[ __ ] out there applying scientific

4461.88 --> 4467.28
that the current Queen they cannot call

4465.75 --> 4469.08
the science denies if we're applying a

4467.28 --> 4471.33
scientific method and asking them our is

4469.08 --> 4474.96
that the this nonsense that the portion

4471.33 --> 4478.83
is true you should call the video Flat

4474.96 --> 4481.68
Earth united against pseudoscience I'm

4478.83 --> 4485.46
not sure on a caller yeah wouldn't be

4481.68 --> 4487.56
wouldn't that be a good title I don't

4485.46 --> 4491.19
know yeah I'm thought might earth united

4487.56 --> 4494.21
against pseudoscience I think I might

4491.19 --> 4497.07
call it what is the independent variable

4494.21 --> 4500.4
in Flat Earth or what is the independent

4497.07 --> 4501.69
variable for the shape of the globe or

4500.4 --> 4502.65
so I don't know how it's gonna be

4501.69 --> 4504.99
someone to do with the independent

4502.65 --> 4507.299999999999
variable because they hate is these

4504.99 --> 4509.5199999999995
heliocentric priests hate scientific

4507.3 --> 4512.31
method and they project their the

4509.52 --> 4528.780000000001
evasion of scientific method on tours no

4512.31 --> 4532.200000000001
I want to see the science hey Karen

4528.78 --> 4533.099999999999
being kept new Oh Karen be she's got a

4532.2 --> 4537.24
good voice doesn't she

4533.1 --> 4541.56
Oh Karen B you want to get in here Karen

4537.24 --> 4543.0599999999995
B I Karen and get her on the Skype go

that end right I need to change that

4660.12 --> 4668.37
it's woke up by that's changing its

4664.949 --> 4673.0199999999995

4684.3 --> 4687.6900000000005
simple some people I mean someone in

4686.01 --> 4689.58
chat earlier on I can't remember it was

4687.69 --> 4691.7699999999995
he called me riots I've not been called

4689.58 --> 4694.38
miles since I was in high school so the

4691.77 --> 4695.790000000001
people help me a load of things most

4694.38 --> 4697.83
people in flight I have called me answer

4695.79 --> 4701.25
me book everybody in my real world calls

4697.83 --> 4703.44
me Tony and my friends old my family my

4701.25 --> 4705.449
mother my mother calls me Anthony but I

4703.44 --> 4709.62
just get called all things anything fits

4705.449 --> 4716.04
really and I call you Riley when I want

4709.62 --> 4719.369
to poke you wait I wanted to ask did I

4716.04 --> 4722.429
want to ask ok so like so far like

4719.369 --> 4723.869
do you feel like me being um on the show

4722.429 --> 4725.819
and everything like do you feel like

4723.869 --> 4728.398999999999
I've been more disruptive than helpful

4725.819 --> 4734.069
or do you feel like I like what do you

4728.399 --> 4735.719
think Amy yeah cuz I already act so well

4734.069 --> 4737.729
I don't think you've been disruptive but

4735.719 --> 4742.649
uh you've only been on the show twice

4737.729 --> 4744.749000000001
that I can remember so I wouldn't say

4742.649 --> 4746.969
disruptive but would you sit what I say

4744.749 --> 4748.619
constructive I can't think of anything

4746.969 --> 4749.939
that you've added yet other than not I

4748.619 --> 4752.009999999999
don't mean that in a bad way what I mean

4749.939 --> 4753.569
it's like it'd be good to see you out of

4752.01 --> 4757.05
a disagreement with somebody to see how

4753.569 --> 4760.4890000000005
you handle yourself Riley measures

4757.05 --> 4763.019
people's quality by hate their attacking

4760.489 --> 4765.718999999999
no I like to see where they're at

4763.019 --> 4767.939
because I mean that the measure of

4765.719 --> 4770.099
someone's mantel within FA is how do

4767.939 --> 4771.539000000001
they agree disagree with people not not

4770.099 --> 4774.179
so much off strong their arguments are

4771.539 --> 4776.489
it's how good they can listen and then

4774.179 --> 4778.619
him winning the arguments one thing but

4776.489 --> 4780.239
being a good opponent another and it's

4778.619 --> 4784.199
really easy to lose your temper and just

4780.239 --> 4786.03
be like I don't know it's just adverse

4784.199 --> 4788.549999999999
behaved while someone disagrees with it

4786.03 --> 4790.139
and we've seen that loads of times it's

4788.55 --> 4791.55
better when you have a disagreement and

4790.139 --> 4793.379
you actually have the disagreement

4791.55 --> 4795.9890000000005
properly because you actually generally

4793.379 --> 4798.149
progress the discussion and it's good

4795.989 --> 4799.678999999999
for a lot of people lose the temper too

4798.149 --> 4807.51
easily and ends up being a shout and

4799.679 --> 4809.399
showing it's not good yeah so wait but

4807.51 --> 4812.819
I've like in terms of debating like I

4809.399 --> 4814.169000000001
don't like to debate so much but um but

4812.819 --> 4816.329000000001
I can't like I can't hold my ground

4814.169 --> 4818.669
pretty well like I watch the show to

4816.329 --> 4819.959
hold my debating skills and everything

4818.669 --> 4822.389
like that cuz this is something this is

4819.959 --> 4824.129
the topic that's going to be it means a

4822.389 --> 4825.899
lot and the more and more I talk to

4824.129 --> 4828.179
other people I would have to know how to

4825.899 --> 4832.879
defend my stand my ground and defend my

4828.179 --> 4839.599
point just asking for proof hey Karen

4832.879 --> 4846.839
Hey hi hi hi what are you guys doing

4839.599 --> 4849.4490000000005
killing time we're on my hangout and

4846.839 --> 4850.8099999999995
yeah gheh hangouts was acting weird

4849.449 --> 4854.139999999999
because both

4850.81 --> 4857.14
Anthony and Jessica were on it but they

4854.14 --> 4860.68
couldn't hear each other I could hear

4857.14 --> 4863.2300000000005
that he's not acting out weird again so

4860.68 --> 4865.42
I just got a man on skype I've been

4863.23 --> 4866.62
having a lot of people I've seen a lot

4865.42 --> 4868.24
of people have glitches and hang out

4866.62 --> 4870.04
slightly it's like every time Google

4868.24 --> 4872.349999999999
changes their product it gets worse it

4870.04 --> 4876.37
doesn't get better yeah screen share

4872.35 --> 4880.06
fails well I think what they're doing is

4876.37 --> 4883.12
they're basically updating a more basic

4880.06 --> 4886.42
version and then afterwards they comb

4883.12 --> 4888.91
over the details again they don't work

4886.42 --> 4891.7
in the details with their blueprint that

4888.91 --> 4893.29
they adapt every time that's our what

4891.7 --> 4895.42
they actually upgrade so they have to

4893.29 --> 4897.76
they get the same mistakes back every

4895.42 --> 4900.58
time they update that's I think that's

4897.76 --> 4903.52
probably at the root of it because those

4900.58 --> 4906.25
glitches do get away they do go away

4903.52 --> 4908.4400000000005
eventually but every time it updates

4906.25 --> 4911.59
again the same type of glitches start

4908.44 --> 4916.929999999999
popping up so I think they're updating a

4911.59 --> 4921.42
a num tweaked version every time and

4916.93 --> 4925.68
they retweet it every time I think maybe

4921.42 --> 4928.87
that's what I think how which programmed

4925.68 --> 4930.52
probably I just think they're trying to

4928.87 --> 4933.5199999999995
figure out how to put more spyware in

4930.52 --> 4936.81
their products what they don't need to

4933.52 --> 4939.370000000001
they get all the spyware they need oh

4936.81 --> 4941.950000000001
they probably always can find some more

4939.37 --> 4945.04
spyware oh when can you aim you know

4941.95 --> 4947.23
yeah okay I've got you going back

4945.04 --> 4948.4
through my desk again now some reason

4947.23 --> 4950.759999999999
the settings are changed and it wasn't

4948.4 --> 4956.44
going through my desk anymore bizarre

4950.76 --> 4961.0
okey Karen you wanna do Jonah do a short

4956.44 --> 4963.219999999999
reading for me what is your reading I've

4961.0 --> 4965.08
got 10 people I need 10 voices for 10

4963.22 --> 4966.72
citations they're all the same thing or

4965.08 --> 4968.74
it's just variations on the same theme

4966.72 --> 4970.09
basically it's the definition of the

4968.74 --> 4973.0599999999995
independent variable and how it

4970.09 --> 4975.82
interacts in an experiment and so for

4973.06 --> 4979.06
example I've got making Mike Khurana

4975.82 --> 4980.95
Cavanaugh I've got Arwen

4979.06 --> 4984.13
I've got Jessica on the panel now I've

4980.95 --> 4985.659
got who else Paul

4984.13 --> 4988.27
all from Nathan's chat I've got

4985.659 --> 4989.92
chocolate saying just need voices and

4988.27 --> 4991.540000000001
it's basically like a 10-second

4989.92 --> 4995.4890000000005
recording that I can stick on read in a

4991.54 --> 4998.11
particular document you go for that sure

4995.489 --> 5001.468999999999
just do you want to send it to me and

4998.11 --> 5003.089999999999
hem you record it proper I can record

5001.469 --> 5006.03
now I can record it yeah now if you want

5003.09 --> 5007.59
to do a live and get out of the way it's

5006.03 --> 5008.8099999999995
easy for me if I can record it live as

5007.59 --> 5011.55
well

5008.81 --> 5013.4400000000005
can somebody apps for a scheme oh I

5011.55 --> 5019.02
don't have a mic I don't know whenever I

5013.44 --> 5020.759999999999
do this stuff I like do it I record it

5019.02 --> 5021.96
and then I usually do it a couple times

5020.76 --> 5025.530000000001
because I don't like the way and none

5021.96 --> 5026.969
si8 stuff so it doesn't flow naturally

5025.53 --> 5028.92
after making it through I thought it

5026.969 --> 5031.59
flew naturally for you well most of the

5028.92 --> 5033.659
time it does but sometimes something

5031.59 --> 5039.03
will get in my throat or I don't know I

5033.659 --> 5040.949
have three goes Karen do you know what

5039.03 --> 5050.19
Jessica did it first go our when did it

5040.949 --> 5052.62
first go it's difficult but I I have a

5050.19 --> 5055.589999999999
thing about doing voiceovers I'm picky

5052.62 --> 5058.739
about it okay I'll send you the fine

5055.59 --> 5060.33
thing if you wouldn't mind it would be

5058.739 --> 5061.799999999999
great if you did send it send me a

5060.33 --> 5063.139
buckin Skype because that way I can get

5061.8 --> 5066.51
it off easy

5063.139 --> 5068.61
so it's gonna be one two three four five

5066.51 --> 5075.719
six number six

5068.61 --> 5077.15
I'll send it to in Skype six when's this

5075.719 --> 5079.71
coming out and turning

5077.15 --> 5081.21
well I've ordered did you see jaren's

5079.71 --> 5085.4
latest video well one of his recent

5081.21 --> 5088.77
videos on why he uses a distiller no

5085.4 --> 5090.299999999999
I've seen the title but he's got this

5088.77 --> 5092.040000000001
little thinking is that measures did

5090.3 --> 5094.53
parts per million accounts of his tap

5092.04 --> 5095.969
water and when I saw that I realized

5094.53 --> 5097.53
that they were only cheap and I thought

5095.969 --> 5099.0
even though I'm gonna use it once I

5097.53 --> 5101.13
thought I don't mind buying one just for

5099.0 --> 5102.929
this one use and what I realized is I

5101.13 --> 5105.150000000001
can use it in this this this real

5102.929 --> 5106.679
scientific experiment where I'd

5105.15 --> 5109.409
manipulate the density of the water

5106.679 --> 5110.7300000000005
around the egg and I changed the density

5109.409 --> 5112.379999999999
of the water around the egg and I

5110.73 --> 5114.178999999999
measured the density of the water around

5112.38 --> 5116.55
the egg before and after the change and

5114.179 --> 5117.57
I can make that egg move now according

5116.55 --> 5119.46
to Newton

5117.57 --> 5121.23
you've got an accelerated mass then

5119.46 --> 5124.079
you've got a force according to Newton

5121.23 --> 5126.0
now in scientific experiments if I make

5124.079 --> 5128.25
that egg move and I manipulate the

5126.0 --> 5130.619
medium to do it then the cause is the

5128.25 --> 5132.48
medium change that is the cause that's

5130.619 --> 5134.159
why I'm focusing on the definition of

5132.48 --> 5136.0199999999995
the independent variable but what

5134.159 --> 5137.909
ballers are doing is they're implying

5136.02 --> 5140.9400000000005
that there's a gravitational force and

5137.909 --> 5142.379999999999
then calculating mathematically well

5140.94 --> 5145.348999999999
that's not allowed in scientific

5142.38 --> 5147.21
scientific method because there's no

5145.349 --> 5148.409000000001
inferred causes you're either off the

5147.21 --> 5150.42
cause or you don't

5148.409 --> 5152.4
so what I'll try and demonstrate is that

5150.42 --> 5154.26
if I manipulate the medium and make the

5152.4 --> 5157.44
egg move according to Newton that's a

5154.26 --> 5159.659000000001
force that makes density a force now

5157.44 --> 5161.219
that's not my view on it necessarily but

5159.659 --> 5163.199
that is what the scientific method is

5161.219 --> 5165.869
telling us but what they want to do is

5163.199 --> 5167.339999999999
imply a secondary force calculate for it

5165.869 --> 5169.17
and then tell me that it's the opposite

5167.34 --> 5171.4800000000005
way around and I'm at the point of the

5169.17 --> 5173.82
video is to say no scientific method is

5171.48 --> 5175.829
clear this is the cause you can't have

5173.82 --> 5177.48
an inferred cause it's either the thing

5175.829 --> 5180.389
that I've manipulated is the cause or

5177.48 --> 5182.549999999999
knowing third it and knowing third cause

5180.389 --> 5183.869
so you can't change scientific method

5182.55 --> 5185.070000000001
that's what though that's what would

5183.869 --> 5187.44
tell them that that's what we're told

5185.07 --> 5188.88
this course so that's the point of the

5187.44 --> 5190.5599999999995
video so I'm going to basically how are

5188.88 --> 5192.96
they going to explain it because that

5190.56 --> 5199.26
you can't infer causation in scientific

5192.96 --> 5202.02
method you see yeah so you're using a

5199.26 --> 5203.639
part per million yeah I'm gonna do it

5202.02 --> 5205.469
dead scientific so I measure it before

5203.639 --> 5207.06
measure afterwards and although be a

5205.469 --> 5208.949
gradient afterwards once I put the salt

5207.06 --> 5210.929
solution in it'll be it'll be graduated

5208.949 --> 5213.15
but at least if I can show that the top

5210.929 --> 5215.159
layer of it has changed then I can show

5213.15 --> 5216.54
that the density has changed I can't

5215.159 --> 5217.92
measure the bottom part of it to show

5216.54 --> 5220.17
the other the other value for the

5217.92 --> 5221.7300000000005
gradient but as long as the top made the

5220.17 --> 5223.17
top measure of it is changed and that

5221.73 --> 5225.209999999999
proves that the density of the medium is

5223.17 --> 5227.219
changed while scientific method says

5225.21 --> 5228.78
that that is the cause I don't really

5227.219 --> 5230.429
care how they explain it but I'm not

5228.78 --> 5232.139
gonna let them in fear another cause and

5230.429 --> 5233.6990000000005
then mathematically adjust for it that's

5232.139 --> 5235.9800000000005
not scientific method that's the up

5233.699 --> 5237.869
that's the antithesis which is also or

5235.98 --> 5239.94
Nora says Nora says no that's not the

5237.869 --> 5241.44
cause so it's like this is gonna have to

5239.94 --> 5243.03
be explained on both sides we're gonna

5241.44 --> 5244.0199999999995
have to come to a consensus on what is

5243.03 --> 5245.969
actually going on here

5244.02 --> 5247.679
because if science met scientific method

5245.969 --> 5249.57
says that the cause is the density the

5247.679 --> 5251.459
thing that you manipulate the density of

5249.57 --> 5254.07
the liquid then that's the cause

5251.459 --> 5255.57
in scientific method you can't infer

5254.07 --> 5256.938999999999
that there's another course that's not

5255.57 --> 5263.188999999999
allowed

5256.939 --> 5265.320000000001
hey did you do ranty already no runs

5263.189 --> 5274.709000000001
he's not responded yet oh well he is

5265.32 --> 5279.929
here I think I'm gonna add him oh hi I

5274.709 --> 5282.57
just hey Jesse yeah I was I was the

5279.929 --> 5284.249
reason that I jumped in was Riley's over

5282.57 --> 5287.639
critique of you when you were looking

5284.249 --> 5290.82
for I listened the other day on no

5287.639 --> 5294.900000000001
fisherman and I found your your input

5290.82 --> 5298.579
calming logical and very well structured

5294.9 --> 5301.469
so keep it up Mike it's it's it's it's I

5298.579 --> 5303.199
didn't mean it as an old critique I just

5301.469 --> 5305.159
meant that I was waiting for it to like

5303.199 --> 5307.169999999999
express some views on the shape of the

5305.159 --> 5310.259999999999
earth before I come to it okay I know I

5307.17 --> 5312.719
just just saying I think I think you

5310.26 --> 5314.459
were refreshing here i sat and listened

5312.719 --> 5316.229
to you our good matter

5314.459 --> 5318.78
I was dipping in and out chasing rabbits

5316.229 --> 5321.599
around the garden and stuff on on

5318.78 --> 5322.139
Thursday but I enjoyed listening to your

5321.599 --> 5325.110000000001
opinion

5322.139 --> 5328.079
yes sir yeah she's not she's nice on the

5325.11 --> 5330.478999999999
considered as well Randy joined us by

5328.079 --> 5334.82
the way you've got a famous sounding

5330.479 --> 5339.51
voice Jessica you can't assign lateness

5334.82 --> 5344.369
what fame has a sound know like like

5339.51 --> 5347.369000000001
somebody like familiar who's famous if

5344.369 --> 5349.11
you are me I'm struggling to place I I

5347.369 --> 5354.058999999999
think I know what you mean well she just

5349.11 --> 5355.799999999999
has a very calm and confident voice calm

5354.059 --> 5360.4490000000005
and confident that's interesting

5355.8 --> 5372.229
companies it's very compelling very

5360.449 --> 5381.419999999999
inviting miss Geist Riley's recording

5372.229 --> 5383.280000000001
recording our voices okay Riley just

5381.42 --> 5384.87
joined but that's not really a missing

5383.28 --> 5388.98
shuttle

5384.87 --> 5391.47
maybe one IV never really mr. ninety

5388.98 --> 5396.12
just more balls just being [ __ ] and

5391.47 --> 5399.6900000000005
laughs that didn't happen here on the

5396.12 --> 5401.37
show but no just saying about our

5399.69 --> 5404.04
scientific method are they criticize us

5401.37 --> 5405.87
for not for being science denies and

5404.04 --> 5408.09
when it comes down to it it's them that

5405.87 --> 5410.82
deny the science we want to see it but

5408.09 --> 5412.62
they yeah we have to expose that they're

5410.82 --> 5423.69
ignoring that they're the was ignoring

5412.62 --> 5429.66
science we have to expose that Souls so

5423.69 --> 5430.98
any doing voice-overs well yeah I wasn't

5429.66 --> 5437.389999999999
gonna ask you to do one because you

5430.98 --> 5437.389999999999
sound like you're in the toilet okay

5441.08 --> 5448.07
corridor you know you're in the toilet a

5445.17 --> 5448.07
year with echoey

5448.28 --> 5455.58
there's no there's no very echoey okay I

5453.75 --> 5473.07
thought it was true that you were in the

5455.58 --> 5487.32
toilet you know there are two ladies on

5473.07 --> 5490.23
this call right Sagan the University of

5487.32 --> 5492.8099999999995
California no no no that one's for Karen

5490.23 --> 5497.719999999999
II by doing it you know I mean - okay I

5492.81 --> 5501.6
like the ones like it yeah yeah

5497.72 --> 5503.67
antecedent I love that word yeah let me

5501.6 --> 5506.1900000000005
let me just address Ramsey well I'm

5503.67 --> 5508.92
doing Ron T have you seen gerunds latest

5506.19 --> 5513.03
video about how and why he's the drinks

5508.92 --> 5514.9800000000005
distilled water no no yeah I was going

5513.03 --> 5517.53
to but I didn't get home so I'll watch

5514.98 --> 5518.91
it later he's bought this little room

5517.53 --> 5521.009999999999
it's only like five

5518.91 --> 5522.24
this parts-per-million counter thing get

5521.01 --> 5524.25
man basically you put it in the water

5522.24 --> 5526.8
and it tells you are many particulates

5524.25 --> 5528.69
are in it per million and obviously like

5526.8 --> 5530.34
tap water's got X amount and then

5528.69 --> 5532.679999999999
distilled waters got basically nothing

5530.34 --> 5534.360000000001
and he's proving that it's got very very

5532.68 --> 5537.33
little or no contaminants in it at all

5534.36 --> 5540.2699999999995
and I thought hmm I could use that so

5537.33 --> 5542.82
what I thought was basically with that

5540.27 --> 5545.31
egg and when when freaked out words did

5542.82 --> 5547.0199999999995
his egg thing that's a really good

5545.31 --> 5548.580000000001
experiment that he did but he didn't

5547.02 --> 5550.2300000000005
quite do it the best the way that I

5548.58 --> 5550.86
wanted it to be done so I'm gonna have

5550.23 --> 5552.57
to do it myself

5550.86 --> 5554.4
not that I'm criticizing Nick just that

5552.57 --> 5556.44
I can the way I'm gonna do it isn't

5554.4 --> 5556.98
gonna show I'm gonna take I'm gonna fill

5556.44 --> 5559.169999999999
up a jug

5556.98 --> 5561.839999999999
I'm gonna take ten fluid ounces out I'm

5559.17 --> 5563.25
gonna make that saturated with salt and

5561.84 --> 5564.99
then put that in a cup next to it so

5563.25 --> 5566.85
that I can basically remove ten fluid

5564.99 --> 5568.95
out of the thing later once I've got the

5566.85 --> 5571.38
egg sat in its suspended state in its

5568.95 --> 5573.57
middle take out ten fluid ounces pour in

5571.38 --> 5576.51
the salt saturated ten fluid ten fluid

5573.57 --> 5578.099999999999
ounces the egg will move and I want to

5576.51 --> 5579.4800000000005
measure the parts per million before and

5578.1 --> 5582.06
after to prove that the density has

5579.48 --> 5585.509999999999
changed using ball as like boy if we can

5582.06 --> 5587.490000000001
do a little bit of scientific nostalgia

5585.51 --> 5589.26
bility to it so I got the idea when I

5587.49 --> 5590.7
saw jaren's video so I thought right

5589.26 --> 5592.56
I'll measure the parts per million

5590.7 --> 5594.12
before I put the salt salt such

5592.56 --> 5595.89
generates a solution in then I'll

5594.12 --> 5597.93
measure the parts per million after of

5595.89 --> 5599.37
what the salt saturated solution in the

5597.93 --> 5601.200000000001
egg will move and all there'll be a

5599.37 --> 5603.09
gradient so it'll be like less at the

5601.2 --> 5604.5
top but more at the bottom but as long

5603.09 --> 5606.93
as I can show that there's a change in

5604.5 --> 5608.82
the D in the medium if I can get once

5606.93 --> 5610.29
that egg starts to move at least

5608.82 --> 5613.2
according to Newton there's a force

5610.29 --> 5615.81
though well in scientific method there

5613.2 --> 5617.34
cause in a scientific experiment is the

5615.81 --> 5619.47
manipulated thing the thing that you

5617.34 --> 5621.3
manipulate in the experiments so if I

5619.47 --> 5623.97
manipulate the medium that's the cause

5621.3 --> 5626.04
in scientific experiments and what it

5623.97 --> 5628.38
doesn't say in the definitions is that

5626.04 --> 5630.24
you can infer some other cause and then

5628.38 --> 5631.41
calculate mathematically for it which is

5630.24 --> 5633.69
what they're all doing they're all

5631.41 --> 5635.4
saying yeah but buoyancy buoyancy really

5633.69 --> 5637.2
gravity's working here it's pulling them

5635.4 --> 5639.179999999999
the salt down and it's pushing the egg

5637.2 --> 5640.679999999999
open because of gravity and I'm like

5639.18 --> 5642.900000000001
that's not what scientific method allows

5640.68 --> 5646.9800000000005
you to do scientific method states

5642.9 --> 5648.8099999999995
clearly the cause is the manipulation so

5646.98 --> 5650.969999999999
if I manipulate the medium that's the

5648.81 --> 5652.71
cause in scientific method you guys are

5650.97 --> 5654.63
going to literally have to argue against

5652.71 --> 5656.7300000000005
scientific method the very thing you

5654.63 --> 5658.26
accusers off so I'm gonna I want them to

5656.73 --> 5659.58
explain it because the count they can

5658.26 --> 5661.530000000001
only the only thing they can do is

5659.58 --> 5663.42
accept scientific method otherwise

5661.53 --> 5664.83
they're all science deniers and that's

5663.42 --> 5666.39
the whole that's that's what the point

5664.83 --> 5672.26
of the video is going to be shoulder

5666.39 --> 5675.2390000000005
ball is to be science deniers okay yes

5672.26 --> 5676.9800000000005
can I add a suggestion for the way

5675.239 --> 5680.75
you're gonna do that in terms of the

5676.98 --> 5683.009999999999
change a go idiom instead of

5680.75 --> 5686.43
three-quarter Faline you jog fill your

5683.01 --> 5688.77
jog all the way up to the top and then

5686.43 --> 5691.8
take your saturated sale and solution

5688.77 --> 5695.1
and pour it just down the side and what

5691.8 --> 5697.05
will happen is you'll you you keep one

5695.1 --> 5699.030000000001
of your constant variables there because

5697.05 --> 5701.820000000001
what you're going to do is change your

5699.03 --> 5704.25
volume if what you actually do is just

5701.82 --> 5707.58
gently pour down the side you'll keep

5704.25 --> 5709.86
the the the the water flow to a minimum

5707.58 --> 5711.84
but you will actually change the medium

5709.86 --> 5713.429999999999
whilst keeping the volume fix because it

5711.84 --> 5715.26
will just overflow if it's already

5713.43 --> 5717.42
filled to the brim already and it'll

5715.26 --> 5719.820000000001
push out as a seat I see what you're

5717.42 --> 5721.77
saying is is that is that better than

5719.82 --> 5723.0599999999995
taking to a measured 10 fluid ounces out

5721.77 --> 5726.030000000001
and then replacing it with 10 yeah

5723.06 --> 5727.77
because it should helpfully demonstrate

5726.03 --> 5729.15
the movement that you're creating the

5727.77 --> 5731.700000000001
vector change that it's creating by the

5729.15 --> 5733.0199999999995
change in density because if you take it

5731.7 --> 5735.719
out and put it back in it's hard to

5733.02 --> 5737.88
visually see the egg move if you pour it

5735.719 --> 5740.61
very very slowly you'll keep the

5737.88 --> 5743.01
completely agitation core to the minimum

5740.61 --> 5745.65
and the disturbance at the end but it

5743.01 --> 5747.51
will go down and it will push out the

5745.65 --> 5749.4
fresher water because that water will be

5747.51 --> 5752.13
slightly heavier and the fact you're

5749.4 --> 5753.719
pouring it in will force it down into

5752.13 --> 5755.91
that into the pool of water and that

5753.719 --> 5759.4800000000005
should keep your volume fixed that's a

5755.91 --> 5761.849999999999
good well is there a way to color the

5759.48 --> 5764.91
two signals what I was thinking is there

5761.85 --> 5766.92
a way color it boy color in there yeah

5764.91 --> 5769.98
no but one it just didn't like dilute

5766.92 --> 5771.96
because of the volume change they will

5769.98 --> 5774.2699999999995
you'll see won't you so it will give you

5771.96 --> 5776.79
a good idea of that if you say I've

5774.27 --> 5779.790000000001
dissolved in this 1 liter of water I've

5776.79 --> 5782.76
put 300 grams of salt in it we can work

5779.79 --> 5785.37
out the relative density of that and if

5782.76 --> 5786.51
you then pour that in and you know how

5785.37 --> 5788.76
much you've put in and you

5786.51 --> 5792.21
can see the roof of approximate color

5788.76 --> 5795.030000000001
change you can say well it was about 50%

5792.21 --> 5797.369
diluted so do not mean you can make an

5795.03 --> 5799.768999999999
approximation to that what I'm thinking

5797.369 --> 5802.139
of doing is when I put my saturated salt

5799.769 --> 5806.369000000001
solution if I do that in a shallow but

5802.139 --> 5807.809
wide Cup you know I can a bowl then the

5806.369 --> 5809.369
depth then isn't going to be an issue

5807.809 --> 5811.38
I'll be able to measure the density

5809.369 --> 5813.03
variation so we won't have to calculate

5811.38 --> 5814.650000000001
it I'll be able to actually measure it

5813.03 --> 5815.55
in parts per million and that way

5814.65 --> 5816.989
they're not going to be able to argue

5815.55 --> 5818.01
anything about the measurement because

5816.989 --> 5820.11
they're gonna have to argue against

5818.01 --> 5822.059
science again against technology again

5820.11 --> 5823.44
right Tony you could literally check you

5822.059 --> 5824.639
can literally test it right now if

5823.44 --> 5826.65
you've got some food quality you don't

5824.639 --> 5831.659000000001
need to go to the to the trouble of

5826.65 --> 5833.789
trying to get it all completely clear of

5831.659 --> 5835.679
all the nutrients and stuff in it you

5833.789 --> 5838.92
can literally just do salt water versus

5835.679 --> 5840.84
tap water or whatever and just I know

5838.92 --> 5842.01
boys this just just a lot some color in

5840.84 --> 5844.829
each and just see if it works

5842.01 --> 5846.42
oh yeah I can do that but it's isn't the

5844.829 --> 5848.4
main issue going to be proving that the

5846.42 --> 5850.65
the variable has changed in other words

5848.4 --> 5853.768999999999
the density has changed that's gonna be

5850.65 --> 5855.119
the issue right because they're going to

5853.769 --> 5857.7300000000005
argue that it's not density they're

5855.119 --> 5859.71
gonna argue that it's gravity right are

5857.73 --> 5861.449
you right Tony I forgot about you port 4

5859.71 --> 5864.599
million that's clever idea to do that at

5861.449 --> 5866.73
the beginning of the experiment and then

5864.599 --> 5869.25
to do it at the end and to show that the

5866.73 --> 5872.009999999999
variance and in both the height of the

5869.25 --> 5874.619
egg in the medium and and the Bostrom

5872.01 --> 5876.96
million value is quite quite cool yeah

5874.619 --> 5878.759999999999
because that's adds credibility to the

5876.96 --> 5880.559
claim that I'm making that is if I

5878.76 --> 5882.3
change the density of the medium then

5880.559 --> 5884.01
the egg should move and then if I do

5882.3 --> 5885.6900000000005
change the identity of the medium and

5884.01 --> 5887.4890000000005
the egg moves at least according to

5885.69 --> 5888.629999999999
Newton we don't even accept anyway but

5887.489 --> 5890.61
at least according to Newton there's a

5888.63 --> 5892.53
force there because it's moving and then

5890.61 --> 5894.839999999999
that force is caused by me change in the

5892.53 --> 5897.059
density or boy's gravity and then they

5894.84 --> 5898.32
want to infer gravity's there well

5897.059 --> 5899.28
that's not that falls outside a

5898.32 --> 5900.84
scientific method

5899.28 --> 5902.909
so then what they're gonna say is that I

5900.84 --> 5904.650000000001
don't understand scientific method well

5902.909 --> 5906.48
I don't mind them saying that that's why

5904.65 --> 5908.28
I'm getting 10 citations telling us what

5906.48 --> 5910.259999999999
the independent variable is and how it

5908.28 --> 5911.82
interacts with the experiment but that's

5910.26 --> 5913.860000000001
why I'm pre-empting their attacks before

5911.82 --> 5916.199
and with 10 different citations from a

5913.86 --> 5918.089999999999
variety of different sources most of

5916.199 --> 5920.9
which are universities telling us that

5918.09 --> 5920.900000000001
it is the cause

5920.96 --> 5926.04
they're gonna literally dismiss what

5923.25 --> 5928.08
what everything's in the video well

5926.04 --> 5931.5
can't you do a series of different tests

5928.08 --> 5933.63
you know so so you know you have them in

5931.5 --> 5936.95
different amount so you could have like

5933.63 --> 5940.89
four jars of the four different

5936.95 --> 5943.23
solutions yeah and then you can see it

5940.89 --> 5946.200000000001
relative to each one I could do that

5943.23 --> 5949.349999999999
yeah but I forget this pup encounter I

5946.2 --> 5951.3
mean they're only a fiver and but if I

5949.35 --> 5953.58
can get that and then it means that I

5951.3 --> 5957.38
can prove the density I don't we don't

5953.58 --> 5957.38
need to guess or calculate it okay

5957.71 --> 5963.36
I've ordered it what they're gonna have

5962.13 --> 5965.7
to literally say and that's why you

5963.36 --> 5967.139999999999
that's why if you've got like see that

5965.7 --> 5968.79
the reason why I've gone for the ten

5967.14 --> 5970.38
voices is because if they're all flat

5968.79 --> 5971.79
earth is right it shows the flat earth

5970.38 --> 5973.4400000000005
is that we should be listening to each

5971.79 --> 5975.9
other because we're all saying the same

5973.44 --> 5977.429999999999
thing which we are and because that this

5975.9 --> 5979.0199999999995
is these are the definitions in

5977.43 --> 5980.55
scientific method that they are the

5979.02 --> 5982.59
independent variable is the cause and

5980.55 --> 5984.96
you have to manipulate it that's what

5982.59 --> 5986.22
that's how you prove cause and effect so

5984.96 --> 5987.96
if we're all saying the same thing from

5986.22 --> 5989.37
the Flat Earth as perspectives it'll be

5987.96 --> 5991.2
like well this is everyone telling us

5989.37 --> 5994.71
the same thing this is what we should go

5991.2 --> 5997.3099999999995
for no okay fine super code in the chat

5994.71 --> 6001.01
he says weight is a force due to gravity

5997.31 --> 6002.84
you want to respond to that well weight

6001.01 --> 6005.33
is only a force due to gravity in maths

6002.84 --> 6007.1
it's not a force due to gravity in real

6005.33 --> 6011.75
world and if you can't demonstrate it

6007.1 --> 6013.820000000001
that makes it pseudo science experiment

6011.75 --> 6015.89
is the king of all science that's

6013.82 --> 6021.98
literally the definition you have to

6015.89 --> 6024.38
have experiment you can't have super guy

6021.98 --> 6025.849999999999
you can't you can't infer that there's

6024.38 --> 6028.1900000000005
an additional force though with weight

6025.85 --> 6030.2300000000005
little G unless you can manipulate

6028.19 --> 6031.79
little G and prove that it's the cause

6030.23 --> 6033.469999999999
of the buoyancy effect that you're

6031.79 --> 6036.05
claiming because that's outside of

6033.47 --> 6037.58
science he's gonna be a good example of

6036.05 --> 6040.01
how they have to literally deny

6037.58 --> 6042.14
everything in scientific method to try

6040.01 --> 6043.7
and explain this away or he's gonna say

6042.14 --> 6045.5
that you don't understand it which I'm

6043.7 --> 6047.24
not bothered about or he's gonna after

6045.5 --> 6048.77
well I don't know what else he can do

6047.24 --> 6050.99
they have to either say that the after

6048.77 --> 6052.67
either dismiss it proved me wrong or

6050.99 --> 6053.659
just accuse me of not being able to

6052.67 --> 6061.07
understand it

6053.659 --> 6063.11
I think there's some ballers in chat

6061.07 --> 6067.3099999999995
that can't really let go of the

6063.11 --> 6070.63
presupposition of gravity and yet to be

6067.31 --> 6073.84
fair though I can definitely explain

6070.63 --> 6077.87
literally a lot of things through that

6073.84 --> 6079.85
presupposition of gravity that's all of

6077.87 --> 6081.86
it all unless you can demonstrate it

6079.85 --> 6082.67
though it's not silence exactly well

6081.86 --> 6085.389
that's the point

6082.67 --> 6088.58
but you can't definitely explain all

6085.389 --> 6090.01
phenomena you can explain anything with

6088.58 --> 6093.35
a little bit of maths

6090.01 --> 6095.54
yeah but it does mechanically work out

6093.35 --> 6098.030000000001
if you would model it it would work out

6095.54 --> 6100.79
if you would emulate it it would work

6098.03 --> 6106.699
out but yeah that's really nice it works

6100.79 --> 6109.01
out it's just not literally they're not

6106.699 --> 6111.61
like the force there is no constant

6109.01 --> 6114.320000000001
force disequilibrium present it only

6111.61 --> 6117.7699999999995
apparently is it appears to be like that

6114.32 --> 6120.37
the forces that actually act come from

6117.77 --> 6126.13
the relative density this equilibrium

6120.37 --> 6126.13
that's where the force comes into play

6126.58 --> 6131.23
it's local it's not uniform

6132.81 --> 6141.900000000001
in both the mass of the object Oh volume

6138.15 --> 6145.92
is low I was saying that can you hear me

6141.9 --> 6147.99
yeah yeah I was saying that the like the

6145.92 --> 6150.72
mass of the object like the weight of

6147.99 --> 6152.79
the object like which is which is what's

6150.72 --> 6154.89
so funny to me about gravity is that

6152.79 --> 6158.49
like when you translate the word it

6154.89 --> 6161.280000000001
actually means weight so it's like so

6158.49 --> 6163.349999999999
it's like he was really taking like

6161.28 --> 6165.599999999999
weights like the heaviness of an object

6163.35 --> 6168.18
and trying to reify that into some type

6165.6 --> 6171.030000000001
of field that causes objects to have

6168.18 --> 6173.610000000001
their well that's a weight but that's

6171.03 --> 6176.28
not but it's not a field it's just that

6173.61 --> 6179.88
object has a certain weight they saw

6176.28 --> 6183.57
that they saw what it's made of and then

6179.88 --> 6186.0
that's what causes deep though so causes

6183.57 --> 6187.799999999999
that shift and the this with

6186.0 --> 6190.35
disequilibrium like how much of an

6187.8 --> 6192.0
impact that out of it will have falling

6190.35 --> 6194.9400000000005
on something and going in something

6192.0 --> 6198.48
rising whatever basically you throw it

6194.94 --> 6201.089999999999
you throw ball depending on how you know

6198.48 --> 6202.379999999999
thence that object is that's that's how

6201.09 --> 6208.38
it will affect whatever you're throwing

6202.38 --> 6212.43
at ball it basically is that the inserts

6208.38 --> 6215.67
of force yes all right and then as soon

6212.43 --> 6218.04
as that force kind of wears off it

6215.67 --> 6222.15
becomes subject to the relative density

6218.04 --> 6225.21
disequilibrium it will find itself in -

6222.15 --> 6230.3099999999995
and then those forces manifest and that

6225.21 --> 6231.84
is how it basically then before it

6230.31 --> 6234.51
started out with the force that was

6231.84 --> 6235.77
mechanically introduced and then the

6234.51 --> 6240.42
force of the relative density

6235.77 --> 6243.72
disequilibrium sets in that's basically

6240.42 --> 6246.93
when you throw a ball it will from a

6243.72 --> 6251.81
subjective viewing point fall down to

6246.93 --> 6251.81
earth well

6254.82 --> 6260.648999999999
now no super curve I am not making up

6259.089 --> 6263.679
pseudoscience the relative density

6260.649 --> 6266.499000000001
theory is proven scientifically and that

6263.679 --> 6269.28
is why it's very useful to build with

6266.499 --> 6272.019
that to conceptualize so I'm basically

6269.28 --> 6275.499
performing the same type of structuring

6272.019 --> 6278.979
as the gravity presuppositional gravity

6275.499 --> 6283.239
theory does except I actually build the

6278.979 --> 6286.619000000001
same structure work on a proven theory

6283.239 --> 6289.629
and it works out works out just as well

6286.619 --> 6291.879
it's just not what you're used to it's

6289.629 --> 6299.139
not what's what what everybody's used to

6291.879 --> 6301.749
learning in the books that's all so yeah

6299.139 --> 6303.939
you can scoff at it all you want it like

6301.749 --> 6306.329
all your fantasies are when this is so

6303.939 --> 6306.329000000001
crazy

6306.359 --> 6312.820000000001
yeah well that's called baller allergy

6309.099 --> 6315.099
it's typical mm-hmm and you will figure

6312.82 --> 6318.728999999999
it out in the end maybe or you're just

6315.099 --> 6321.909000000001
gonna be like this forever and just move

6318.729 --> 6323.320000000001
on to the next chat of some flat earth

6321.909 --> 6326.28
or to complain about and basically

6323.32 --> 6329.32
ridicule every little detail about them

6326.28 --> 6331.389
to comfort you that you are smarter

6329.32 --> 6333.909
because they have silly elements to them

6331.389 --> 6335.349
and you're gonna spend the rest of your

6333.909 --> 6339.188999999999
life like that or you're gonna wake up

6335.349 --> 6342.099
and figure out like wait okay they had a

6339.189 --> 6345.309
point after all what were they really

6342.099 --> 6348.76
saying now that I'm no whelping the ball

6345.309 --> 6354.579000000001
or allergy you never know awesome some

6348.76 --> 6357.729
people do I don't either

6354.579 --> 6359.739
yeah I've just found out that you know

6357.729 --> 6361.599
squid ink you know that squid ink that

6359.739 --> 6363.638999999999
you can buy that go you get it in some

6361.599 --> 6367.2390000000005
like Japanese meals and whatever in a

6363.639 --> 6369.789
sachet hmm it's got a density of 1.27

6367.239 --> 6372.07
grams per centimeter cubed so basically

6369.789 --> 6377.829
I think that would sink in the water

6372.07 --> 6379.749
wouldn't it yeah but so if I mixed it in

6377.829 --> 6381.398999999999
with my salt solution it would increase

6379.749 --> 6383.469
the density of the salt solution and

6381.399 --> 6385.2300000000005
just turn it black so then all I do is

6383.469 --> 6386.67
pour that in and then that would flip

6385.23 --> 6391.08
to the bottom and form a layer at the

6386.67 --> 6392.7
bottom right yeah you'll see well not

6391.08 --> 6394.62
necessarily because you've got two

6392.7 --> 6396.57
different rates of mixing you've got the

6394.62 --> 6399.54
squid ink which you'll be the suspension

6396.57 --> 6403.29
which will be subject to needing more

6399.54 --> 6405.03
agitation to make split I won't worry

6403.29 --> 6407.82
because you're putting in a saturated

6405.03 --> 6409.53
saline so that's gonna it will pull at

6407.82 --> 6412.679999999999
the bottom a bit but it is also going to

6409.53 --> 6414.599999999999
disperse and indeed you know into into

6412.68 --> 6417.780000000001
the rest but by pouring it in over the

6414.6 --> 6420.18
top this is what I'm saying the

6417.78 --> 6422.46
saturated stuffs going to naturally go

6420.18 --> 6425.070000000001
down to the bottom and it's just going

6422.46 --> 6428.85
to force out the the other stuff so your

6425.07 --> 6430.2
effect I do it without me I think if you

6428.85 --> 6431.9400000000005
want to do it put a food coloring

6430.2 --> 6433.41
something like something dense like

6431.94 --> 6435.87
that's going to require more agitation

6433.41 --> 6437.46
and probably skew actually how much

6435.87 --> 6439.62
density you've increased higher up

6437.46 --> 6443.58
because it will just the squid ink will

6439.62 --> 6446.91
sink more I notice that add fish use a

6443.58 --> 6450.33
light food colorant mm-hmm I like not

6446.91 --> 6452.04
dark well like a red or or or agree on

6450.33 --> 6457.04
something because all you wanting to

6452.04 --> 6457.04
show is just how it's merging and mixing

6457.97 --> 6461.76
but I don't think that that whatever you

6460.32 --> 6464.25
use it will make a difference if you

6461.76 --> 6466.320000000001
saturate enough get enough salt

6464.25 --> 6470.01
dissolved into that solution first out

6466.32 --> 6472.469999999999
I'll do the trick right at first if you

6470.01 --> 6474.27
add dye to the salt and you add that to

6472.47 --> 6477.14
the water then first it will

6474.27 --> 6481.700000000001
simultaneously dissolve but eventually

6477.14 --> 6485.400000000001
the salt and the dye will separate and

6481.7 --> 6488.61
they will yeah basically spread out

6485.4 --> 6493.469999999999
separately eventually so but it's an

6488.61 --> 6496.65
interesting thing to do mmm Riley I have

6493.47 --> 6499.400000000001
a question by the way for you you talk

6496.65 --> 6501.839999999999
about eggs floating in water so much

6499.4 --> 6503.429999999999
seriously not it used to be really

6501.84 --> 6507.18
annoyed by it but now it's I think it's

6503.43 --> 6511.5
just funny but do you have like next to

6507.18 --> 6514.650000000001
your bed do you have a glass tube with

6511.5 --> 6517.59
oil and water and an egg in it at all

6514.65 --> 6518.449
night hmm like a lava lamp yeah but with

6517.59 --> 6525.92
an egg

6518.449 --> 6525.919999999999
no he's showing off because as a girlie

6529.64 --> 6537.87
you know what's really potentially

6534.09 --> 6539.610000000001
Hatchin ACK we said I feel like an atom

6537.87 --> 6542.04
I thought it was offering to set you up

6539.61 --> 6546.449
or go for me get get Riley a density

6542.04 --> 6548.79
tube I've not I've got like a big joke

6546.449 --> 6550.53
you know I came you know is sangria joke

6548.79 --> 6552.87
or whatever it's like a tall thin thing

6550.53 --> 6554.58
and I'm Scott it's got a green tone to

6552.87 --> 6556.26
it also it's not ideal but it's it's

6554.58 --> 6558.51
okay it's it's translucent you'll see

6556.26 --> 6560.1900000000005
the egg move and I'm just not sure it's

6558.51 --> 6562.110000000001
good enough for the cause of the color

6560.19 --> 6564.2699999999995
of it I'm not sure it's good to do so I

6562.11 --> 6566.699
might have to try and find a Avars or

6564.27 --> 6567.929
something like a glass bars in fact

6566.699 --> 6578.69
actually I should be I found one of them

6567.929 --> 6578.6900000000005
should now yeah pint glass is perfect

6579.71 --> 6586.949
is it gonna give me enough water though

6582.12 --> 6588.39
to create the density variation yeah the

6586.949 --> 6590.489
egg will flow in that won't it there's

6588.39 --> 6593.400000000001
enough space for the egg to be buoyant

6590.489 --> 6595.11
and free you don't want too much water

6593.4 --> 6598.049999999999
you just want enough for the egg to be

6595.11 --> 6601.86
free to be able to be freely boy

6598.05 --> 6603.51
wherever it is in the I know both have

6601.86 --> 6605.099999999999
not got a lot of volume and that it

6603.51 --> 6606.54
creates a denser gradings in a very

6605.1 --> 6609.84
short volume right

6606.54 --> 6612.989
no it's denser hey Riley dude do you

6609.84 --> 6615.75
know like those I think they're like

6612.989 --> 6620.04
either in Ireland or in Britain the

6615.75 --> 6621.409
super long drinking glasses maybe also

6620.04 --> 6624.39
dial

6621.409 --> 6626.07
hey y'all developing right right maybe

6624.39 --> 6628.8
you could score one of those things for

6626.07 --> 6634.62
it if it would be wide enough for the

6628.8 --> 6641.2390000000005
egg to basically move it to fin nice all

6634.62 --> 6643.86
we're not so challenge hmm that's debate

6641.239 --> 6646.459999999999
or you'd have to take like small-scale a

6643.86 --> 6646.46
course um

6649.909 --> 6661.379999999999
Pyne pot will do it perfect mate

6652.71 --> 6662.82
honestly I was great shall by shape did

6661.38 --> 6665.429
you see my video that apply out today

6662.82 --> 6667.98
about the bulb disappearing

6665.429 --> 6673.559
or should I say not disappearing over

6667.98 --> 6675.178999999999
the curb did you get a look anything so

6673.559 --> 6677.1900000000005
it's basically like a time lapse

6675.179 --> 6680.309
basically like a time lapse of I

6677.19 --> 6682.04
followed this boat yesterday and it

6680.309 --> 6685.59
doesn't go over the curvature obviously

6682.04 --> 6689.19
but sir it's just an absolute perfect

6685.59 --> 6691.409000000001
example of it going into the Mirage

6689.19 --> 6694.348999999999
layer and getting smaller with distance

6691.409 --> 6696.36
I don't change the focus anything like

6694.349 --> 6698.52
that it's literally call it in 4k and

6696.36 --> 6702.659
you can watch it and it is it just

6698.52 --> 6709.77
disappears due to perspective really

6702.659 --> 6711.449
cool it's almost fab as I've got one

6709.77 --> 6714.659000000001
from higher up as well but I'll be

6711.449 --> 6717.509999999999
releasing later so so I've got one from

6714.659 --> 6719.699
you know about happen out maybe maybe

6717.51 --> 6721.59
three feet above sea level and one

6719.699 --> 6725.82
around about 35 40 feet above sea level

6721.59 --> 6730.2300000000005
so nice it's cool it's an interesting

6725.82 --> 6732.119
ice-cream you have there really if I

6730.23 --> 6739.169999999999
make your Airstream how many ice creams

6732.119 --> 6741.03
do you have left - the sprinkles are

6739.17 --> 6751.7390000000005
what's good I think he's on mute he

6741.03 --> 6753.329
doesn't realise ice cream can you take

6751.739 --> 6757.709999999999
for ice creams off me and leave you at

6753.329 --> 6759.659
-3 in math you can only in math so runty

6757.71 --> 6762.449
but not in real world right that's right

6759.659 --> 6763.589999999999
same for gravity you can't have gravity

6762.449 --> 6766.049999999999
in real world unless you can demonstrate

6763.59 --> 6768.27
it but I can demonstrate that I have one

6766.05 --> 6770.01
ice cream and in about 30 seconds I will

6768.27 --> 6771.4800000000005
have no ice creams but can you

6770.01 --> 6774.829000000001
demonstrate that if it's all in your

6771.48 --> 6774.829
mouth no

6775.929 --> 6782.4400000000005
Randy Randy well technically somebody

6778.96 --> 6785.53
could take for ice creams of you if you

6782.44 --> 6794.379999999999
only had one by forcing you to get three

6785.53 --> 6801.969
more and hand them over you know as long

6794.38 --> 6804.909000000001
as there are more ice creams right I get

6801.969 --> 6807.159
your point you know people have to get

6804.909 --> 6809.259999999999
out of the mindset that math is science

6807.159 --> 6813.61
like there are two separate fields for a

6809.26 --> 6816.1900000000005
reason literally right after math you

6813.61 --> 6821.23
saying math is a cool yeah math is

6816.19 --> 6823.96
mechanical yeah you seem very good

6821.23 --> 6828.04
anything sorry she seems very clued up

6823.96 --> 6833.83
Jessica very what you're very clued up

6828.04 --> 6837.64
for such a young lady yeah wise it's

6833.83 --> 6845.89
quite woke get with no aunty it's called

6837.64 --> 6847.2390000000005
woke you all over I think I think she

6845.89 --> 6848.77
must have been listening to Nathan show

6847.239 --> 6850.449
a lot longer than what perhaps we think

6848.77 --> 6853.659000000001
how long have you been a listener

6850.449 --> 6855.73
actually the whole I've been listening

6853.659 --> 6857.259999999999
to a show for a long time but it's it

6855.73 --> 6859.8099999999995
hasn't been that long like about three

6857.26 --> 6862.51
months I've been listening but like I

6859.81 --> 6865.9890000000005
came to the I already understood that

6862.51 --> 6868.4800000000005
math is not based on but like when when

6865.989 --> 6870.25
people would say that math is reality I

6868.48 --> 6872.86
didn't understand that I was like math

6870.25 --> 6874.78
is and I can literally say I have five

6872.86 --> 6876.759999999999
apples and if you take away three of

6874.78 --> 6878.53
those apples only have two left but then

6876.76 --> 6880.81
you actually look at what I have I have

6878.53 --> 6884.62
apples I understood that automatically

6880.81 --> 6888.820000000001
yes so if you had me use the ice creams

6884.62 --> 6890.409
are example before no I haven't so my

6888.82 --> 6892.15
example is always if I've got two ice

6890.409 --> 6893.949
creams you can't take five off me and

6892.15 --> 6896.199
leave me with minus three ice creams I

6893.949 --> 6898.36
always say and it's like it's true you

6896.199 --> 6901.0
can't but in maths if they claim that

6898.36 --> 6904.36
math is reality I mean read rhetoric got

6901.0 --> 6906.79
destroyed three three years ago but

6904.36 --> 6908.83
fight the flow is pushing it again it's

6906.79 --> 6910.53
like as if he's not he's not aware of

6908.83 --> 6913.93
what's happened in the

6910.53 --> 6915.82
most of them aren't seriously short

6913.93 --> 6919.09
attention span that's what you get for

6915.82 --> 6920.83
constantly repeating the same textbook

6919.09 --> 6923.7
stuff over and over again they lose

6920.83 --> 6927.91
track of what is said they don't

6923.7 --> 6930.25
remember the real arguments we make so

6927.91 --> 6932.59
they can that's why for example Brenna

6930.25 --> 6934.69
keeps on saying and asserting and the

6932.59 --> 6938.08
same things and even rumpus does it they

6934.69 --> 6940.24
keep on doing it because of their

6938.08 --> 6945.84
knowledge is based on textbooks and not

6940.24 --> 6953.7699999999995
on the critical thought thinking and

6945.84 --> 6957.55
that makes things blurry don't you think

6953.77 --> 6960.13
that's a failure of the schooling or if

6957.55 --> 6963.7300000000005
you know is it really it's the raping of

6960.13 --> 6966.25
science with pseudoscience nonsense but

6963.73 --> 6967.87
that's the thing oh yes that is what

6966.25 --> 6970.33
like people are told that these people

6967.87 --> 6971.7699999999995
are genuine like even the school

6970.33 --> 6974.5599999999995
teachers and everything like that even

6971.77 --> 6976.84
people who are teaching this science

6974.56 --> 6978.160000000001
they don't even do themselves they don't

6976.84 --> 6981.13
even realize that what they're learning

6978.16 --> 6983.53
is nonsense and that's what's so crazy

6981.13 --> 6986.26
about it it's like they like they age

6983.53 --> 6988.57
they're just stuck in that whole leg

6986.26 --> 6990.16
they think that could conceptualizing

6988.57 --> 6993.82
things and putting them all on paper

6990.16 --> 6996.04
with equations and constructs makes it

6993.82 --> 6997.78
real they've been literally trained in

6996.04 --> 6999.7
programmed to do that and it's like they

6997.78 --> 7001.7699999999995
don't look outside of that and say hey

6999.7 --> 7004.92
this does not this doesn't make sense

7001.77 --> 7007.2300000000005
so it's like so I could like you would

7004.92 --> 7011.76
blame it on the school but it's it's

7007.23 --> 7013.349999999999
really just people being people not

7011.76 --> 7016.08
being talked to critically think and

7013.35 --> 7017.700000000001
like you're told that this is real your

7016.08 --> 7021.09
whole life like what else do you have

7017.7 --> 7022.7699999999995
you don't have anything else so that's

7021.09 --> 7024.39
that's that aspect of it as well

7022.77 --> 7026.990000000001
you would never question it because

7024.39 --> 7029.280000000001
that's all you've been introduced to

7026.99 --> 7030.929999999999
well do you think if you look at it from

7029.28 --> 7033.24
a different point of view which would be

7030.93 --> 7035.280000000001
let's go back I don't know let's just

7033.24 --> 7037.53
say five hundred years for instance

7035.28 --> 7041.24
before schooling before mandatory

7037.53 --> 7043.5
schooling you know you were basically

7041.24 --> 7046.01
your own teacher

7043.5 --> 7051.0
no you observed the world did you saw it

7046.01 --> 7052.92
you experienced it being flat so until

7051.0 --> 7055.53
he was indoctrinated didn't told you was

7052.92 --> 7058.35
spinning and living on a spinning ball

7055.53 --> 7060.42
you know nobody would have thought of

7058.35 --> 7061.740000000001
that really all the majority of people

7060.42 --> 7065.7
wouldn't have done anyway

7061.74 --> 7068.34
you know right it literally had to be

7065.7 --> 7071.49
built up and in that in that time span

7068.34 --> 7073.77
it was just an idea it had it literally

7071.49 --> 7075.63
took I honestly think that it just took

7073.77 --> 7079.14
a group of people all having the same

7075.63 --> 7081.42
idea having one goal and then and then

7079.14 --> 7082.83
I'm starting from a small scale and it's

7081.42 --> 7083.25
spreading out further and further and

7082.83 --> 7085.7699999999995
further

7083.25 --> 7089.13
so that was something gets more and more

7085.77 --> 7091.5
popular like the the voices that are

7089.13 --> 7093.0
saying this is nonsense they get drowned

7091.5 --> 7095.34
out more and more and more the people

7093.0 --> 7097.32
who have the power literally are the

7095.34 --> 7099.63
ones who dictate how things get

7097.32 --> 7103.139999999999
structured exactly just think of 911

7099.63 --> 7104.67
yeah just think of how the majority of

7103.14 --> 7108.6
people now obviously through the

7104.67 --> 7110.58
internet and search and completely aware

7108.6 --> 7113.1
that 9/11 didn't happen the way they

7110.58 --> 7116.5199999999995
told us however if you were to place

7113.1 --> 7118.8
that same event back 20 years before it

7116.52 --> 7122.76
actually happened so pre the internet

7118.8 --> 7124.5
yeah if used to set that back then then

7122.76 --> 7126.06
the narrative obviously they're still

7124.5 --> 7128.61
going with the narrative right let's

7126.06 --> 7130.620000000001
let's be completely straight about that

7128.61 --> 7133.08
they're still saying 9/11 was taken down

7130.62 --> 7135.63
by terrorists in planes we know that

7133.08 --> 7138.03
didn't happen but if it was done 20

7135.63 --> 7140.88
years ago majority of people would

7138.03 --> 7144.509999999999
believe that they would believe it

7140.88 --> 7148.29
because they were told it and yeah even

7144.51 --> 7150.42
though we know history will show in a

7148.29 --> 7152.5199999999995
hundred years or still say in a hundred

7150.42 --> 7154.92
years time that terrorists took the dog

7152.52 --> 7157.17
buildings down by planes right that's

7154.92 --> 7159.51
what the history books will say and all

7157.17 --> 7162.39
the people that are aware now you know

7159.51 --> 7165.27
have it been a miscarriage of justice in

7162.39 --> 7168.81
that respect and their voices will be

7165.27 --> 7171.75
drowned out through censorship the

7168.81 --> 7173.13
twisting of time as it goes by in a

7171.75 --> 7175.02
hundred years time you three or four

7173.13 --> 7176.9400000000005
generations down the line know

7175.02 --> 7180.39
he's gonna really think oh great great

7176.94 --> 7182.099999999999
roundup so that those terrorists didn't

7180.39 --> 7184.14
said the plane that those buildings down

7182.1 --> 7185.46
by claims and yet all the history books

7184.14 --> 7187.35
and all the teachers will be saying

7185.46 --> 7190.05
terrorists with planes took down the

7187.35 --> 7191.25
twin towers and they'll believe that and

7190.05 --> 7193.41
I think that's what happened five

7191.25 --> 7195.27
hundred years ago it was that same a lot

7193.41 --> 7196.59
of thing you know it was like you what

7195.27 --> 7199.200000000001
you are going to believe the earth is

7196.59 --> 7201.57
flat it's like that's our deal earth is

7199.2 --> 7202.92
round and it's like no no because we

7201.57 --> 7205.259999999999
know the earth is flat the Bible says

7202.92 --> 7207.81
the earth is flat the Koran says that

7205.26 --> 7209.9400000000005
the earth is flat oh no no no no no no

7207.81 --> 7212.1900000000005
science says we're spinning bull you

7209.94 --> 7215.4
know if it gets setting off over and

7212.19 --> 7217.23
over and over and over generations go by

7215.4 --> 7221.7
and before you know it you've got what

7217.23 --> 7225.209999999999
we want I don't know it's a good idea

7221.7 --> 7227.67
but I do think that it's probably

7225.21 --> 7230.18
quicker than that it's probably more

7227.67 --> 7233.85
like a revolution thing if they just

7230.18 --> 7238.08
persistently take a school and then

7233.85 --> 7240.0
mandates a certain curriculum and use

7238.08 --> 7242.82
manipulation within that like say oh

7240.0 --> 7246.24
this is the new era this is the new

7242.82 --> 7249.12
truth yeah but then that generation in

7246.24 --> 7251.28
one generation if allowed if not pulled

7249.12 --> 7254.4
out and there's a violent opposition or

7251.28 --> 7257.49
anything to that kind of thing and with

7254.4 --> 7260.16
a strict Empire like the British Empire

7257.49 --> 7262.11
which is pretty harsh in its punishments

7260.16 --> 7265.55
there's not going to be any resistance

7262.11 --> 7269.9
like that so the generations would just

7265.55 --> 7272.9400000000005
start to believe it themselves at first

7269.9 --> 7278.94
yeah it goes much quicker than that just

7272.94 --> 7281.61
one controlled forced education and in

7278.94 --> 7285.509999999999
it starts to set a settle it starts to

7281.61 --> 7287.4
settle in it starts to get in that's one

7285.51 --> 7288.900000000001
of the powers the powers up it is about

7287.4 --> 7291.509999999999
power at the end of the day because I

7288.9 --> 7294.69
even think you can put an idea out there

7291.51 --> 7295.860000000001
and people might like stuff trends all

7294.69 --> 7297.03
the time like we see that on the

7295.86 --> 7298.29
internet all the time someone put

7297.03 --> 7299.28
somebody out there someone says

7298.29 --> 7301.5
something everybody goes around

7299.28 --> 7303.71
parenting and oh my god blah and it

7301.5 --> 7306.99
lasts for about three months

7303.71 --> 7308.86
maybe maybe a year but then after a

7306.99 --> 7311.469999999999
while people just forget about it so

7308.86 --> 7314.29
so verses that versus someone actually

7311.47 --> 7317.05
creating an entire foundational system

7314.29 --> 7318.82
and using their power in order to

7317.05 --> 7320.650000000001
indoctrinate people and control them

7318.82 --> 7324.3099999999995
saying you are going to learn this or

7320.65 --> 7326.049999999999
else in the or else at the end and then

7324.31 --> 7327.46
that happened then that spreading out

7326.05 --> 7329.41
and after a while they don't have to say

7327.46 --> 7331.9
or else it just becomes the norm it

7329.41 --> 7333.639999999999
becomes reality yeah well they've every

7331.9 --> 7336.099999999999
one they probably did it in a way that

7333.64 --> 7338.2300000000005
the teachers definitely knew about it

7336.1 --> 7341.4400000000005
they were literally conditioning cattle

7338.23 --> 7344.07
and if you would just contradict the the

7341.44 --> 7347.469999999999
new system you would just be okay

7344.07 --> 7349.98
or go work in gutter go work in shitty

7347.47 --> 7353.56
jobs because you're not gonna be

7349.98 --> 7355.599999999999
successful basic that's yeah and that

7353.56 --> 7357.580000000001
echoes I'm still kind of but that's

7355.6 --> 7359.29
probably how they started out just pure

7357.58 --> 7361.39
conditioning just like this is what

7359.29 --> 7367.36
you're gonna have to believe or you're

7361.39 --> 7368.950000000001
not gonna get anywhere yes right and by

7367.36 --> 7371.7699999999995
the way I still wanted to respond the

7368.95 --> 7376.99
for a moment to I think was Ron T said

7371.77 --> 7379.75
about about the future in 911 like the

7376.99 --> 7382.42
conceptualization of science and origins

7379.75 --> 7385.21
and the world that's kind of far stretch

7382.42 --> 7387.25
it's much easier to make people switch

7385.21 --> 7390.69
about that but when it comes to actual

7387.25 --> 7393.78
real life events if there is skepticism

7390.69 --> 7399.19
about it by people that actually

7393.78 --> 7403.0599999999995
witnessed it it's much harder to to to

7399.19 --> 7405.669999999999
condition like a media narrative on the

7403.06 --> 7407.38
long run than it is about ethereal

7405.67 --> 7410.35
concepts that are very hard to test

7407.38 --> 7412.93
actually experienced advanced are very

7410.35 --> 7415.59
hard to completely annihilate conspiracy

7412.93 --> 7418.4400000000005
theories or clues about it just look at

7415.59 --> 7421.66
Kennedy the Kennedy assassination even

7418.44 --> 7427.24
though it's so long ago that persisted

7421.66 --> 7428.68
for so long still just generally no even

7427.24 --> 7431.889999999999
if you're gonna go with mainstream like

7428.68 --> 7435.31
even then you know like yeah that's okay

7431.89 --> 7438.31
yes no sorry I wasn't finished almost

7435.31 --> 7441.160000000001
almost in the future it really depends

7438.31 --> 7442.120000000001
on for example with 9/11 if the people

7441.16 --> 7445.66
the group

7442.12 --> 7448.51
that did go with that how that's gonna

7445.66 --> 7450.37
be resolved if they're gonna just like

7448.51 --> 7452.7300000000005
try to hide it and they stay under

7450.37 --> 7455.71
control or if there's gonna be real

7452.73 --> 7458.23
justice like that group is really going

7455.71 --> 7460.63
to be taken on and yeah there's

7458.23 --> 7463.599999999999
definitely seems to be signs that the

7460.63 --> 7467.4400000000005
hardcore insane left is gonna be taken

7463.6 --> 7470.26
down be taken on and they may have some

7467.44 --> 7472.45
involvement sin that but yeah the real

7470.26 --> 7475.26
right-wingers the bush lights and all

7472.45 --> 7477.849999999999
those the neo comes that's much harder

7475.26 --> 7480.34
it's much they are probably gonna stay

7477.85 --> 7483.31
for a while and things like go totally

7480.34 --> 7485.05
revolution so you're probably right

7483.31 --> 7490.09
about that the narratives are gonna

7485.05 --> 7492.43
stick but people submit so stupid asylum

7490.09 --> 7495.22
so you know whether somebody's channel

7492.43 --> 7497.320000000001
gets taken down they take the channel so

7495.22 --> 7499.240000000001
let's suppose in you've stepped up let's

7497.32 --> 7502.0
closing you couples I don't know let's

7499.24 --> 7504.61
say five hundred videos and let's

7502.0 --> 7508.33
suppose in that there's one of them that

7504.61 --> 7511.45
they deem incredibly off the rails you

7508.33 --> 7514.69
know it's like this guy needs to go so

7511.45 --> 7516.429999999999
the other 499 videos that you put out

7514.69 --> 7518.71
that didn't break any rules or

7516.43 --> 7521.83
censorship or anything like that they

7518.71 --> 7525.37
are you know they are taken from the

7521.83 --> 7529.12
internet taken from everybody's public

7525.37 --> 7531.43
domain so those 499 videos that did

7529.12 --> 7533.59
nothing just but put decent information

7531.43 --> 7536.71
out because of one discretion in

7533.59 --> 7541.18
somebody's you know all an opinion they

7536.71 --> 7545.26
remove all of those videos so if you

7541.18 --> 7546.820000000001
think that 9/11 and how we're perceived

7545.26 --> 7549.280000000001
it right now that all these channels

7546.82 --> 7551.799999999999
these truth channels one by one that are

7549.28 --> 7553.87
being picked up one by one one by one

7551.8 --> 7555.7
they're not just taking that so they

7553.87 --> 7557.349999999999
don't even have to take down a 911 video

7555.7 --> 7558.91
they could take down a video about

7557.35 --> 7561.46
something that they might do in a couple

7558.91 --> 7563.68
years time about an event in two years

7561.46 --> 7566.5
time and then when we take that channel

7563.68 --> 7569.200000000001
down all their previous work gets taken

7566.5 --> 7570.82
with them mm-hmm so all that man you

7569.2 --> 7573.37
haven't stopped you know what I'm saying

7570.82 --> 7576.4
is the it's all gonna go we're going to

7573.37 --> 7578.98
get rid of it all it's never going to

7576.4 --> 7581.679999999999
it's just gonna go underground knowledge

7578.98 --> 7585.429999999999
on the internet doesn't go away anymore

7581.68 --> 7587.92
it just goes into the darknet in into

7585.43 --> 7590.35
the secret corners of the Internet it's

7587.92 --> 7592.63
not gonna be public anymore look it's a

7590.35 --> 7595.54
pretty unique time in the last ten years

7592.63 --> 7597.12
especially we're just so much is pretty

7595.54 --> 7600.43
wide in the open

7597.12 --> 7604.63
that's not normal that didn't used to be

7600.43 --> 7607.42
the case and yeah even though they're

7604.63 --> 7611.26
gonna push it back you'll damn better

7607.42 --> 7613.72
believe that there's gonna be a dark web

7611.26 --> 7615.93
a secret circuit with conspiracy

7613.72 --> 7618.280000000001
theories and knowledge and databases of

7615.93 --> 7619.66
secret documents and hidden [ __ ] that's

7618.28 --> 7622.389999999999
always gonna be there it's never gonna

7619.66 --> 7625.03
go away again we are going to have this

7622.39 --> 7627.1900000000005
on hard drives it was mentioned in the

7625.03 --> 7629.259999999999
chat before and I have to say Martin

7627.19 --> 7633.04
legally might be on to it the reset

7629.26 --> 7637.96
could be coming people of people are too

7633.04 --> 7640.09
too aware now of what's going on the

7637.96 --> 7643.42
reason eaters yeah they need to set the

7640.09 --> 7646.21
need to send everybody back and regress

7643.42 --> 7651.67
them 500 years start them off again from

7646.21 --> 7654.43
scratch I don't think so I think they're

7651.67 --> 7657.43
just degenerating us through culture and

7654.43 --> 7659.17
the vast majority is completely becoming

7657.43 --> 7662.13
babies and losing their mind and they

7659.17 --> 7665.65
will shrivel up and die naturally

7662.13 --> 7669.37
eventually or just gonna get themselves

7665.65 --> 7671.95
killed because of their own stupidity so

7669.37 --> 7675.19
I I don't think there's gonna be like a

7671.95 --> 7678.25
giant dominant crackdown because that

7675.19 --> 7682.8099999999995
would literally end the image of Western

7678.25 --> 7688.45
culture the image of freedom they could

7682.81 --> 7691.650000000001
never get it back after that so I don't

7688.45 --> 7691.65
think that that'll happen

7692.36 --> 7700.29
they'll just amp up the corruption and

7696.23 --> 7702.9
make sure all the craziness and a lot of

7700.29 --> 7706.8
people will be dragged into this lose

7702.9 --> 7710.25
themselves and eventually just die only

7706.8 --> 7713.52
the fluoride in the water the medication

7710.25 --> 7715.889
the entrails everything complete all the

7713.52 --> 7720.030000000001
chemicals and the brainwashing and the

7715.889 --> 7721.619
conditioning to operate yourself I look

7720.03 --> 7724.92
back to the grandfather background

7721.619 --> 7726.929
mother McCrae or McCall you know people

7724.92 --> 7729.96
who are over 60 70 years old they were

7726.929 --> 7731.639
super intelligent people you know and

7729.96 --> 7733.7390000000005
you look around at people nowadays and

7731.639 --> 7735.06
they're all that moms you know you

7733.739 --> 7736.888999999999
wouldn't you know you've showed them

7735.06 --> 7739.4400000000005
something and they think it's something

7736.889 --> 7740.31
else it's like it's so [ __ ] it's

7739.44 --> 7744.8099999999995
like the way that the older generation

7740.31 --> 7746.969
was soul clued or before all this you

7744.81 --> 7747.599
know forcing to drink fluoride from the

7746.969 --> 7749.4890000000005
water

7747.599 --> 7754.579
you know when the brains could actually

7749.489 --> 7759.989
form to improperly mm-hmm all right well

7754.579 --> 7761.82
poisoning unwanted groups of people to

7759.989 --> 7766.259999999999
get them out of the way for the long run

7761.82 --> 7769.59
is that's been done for a long long time

7766.26 --> 7773.639
it's just yeah that's a way to basically

7769.59 --> 7776.849
make labels um as they in Germany so

7773.639 --> 7778.86
said it but people's entire groups

7776.849 --> 7782.31
categories of people's after doing that

7778.86 --> 7784.049999999999
for a long time just take a group

7782.31 --> 7786.6900000000005
there's so many people you guys take him

7784.05 --> 7789.9890000000005
out somehow and sometimes it's more fair

7786.69 --> 7791.94
or a joke or poison the cocoa and IKEA

7789.989 --> 7794.218999999999
shuffle but the car you know they can't

7791.94 --> 7797.46
put the kind of adult they can't add 10

7794.219 --> 7799.469
lost her you know it's like whether

7797.46 --> 7800.699
these people come how are you so stupid

7799.469 --> 7803.579
that you can't follow us some

7800.699 --> 7806.129999999999
instructions to put a knock here she'll

7803.579 --> 7808.59
fall because it's allowed to be that

7806.13 --> 7811.349
stupid they're not punished they're not

7808.59 --> 7812.82
they're not being developed nobody's

7811.349 --> 7815.659000000001
taking care of them they're allowed to

7812.82 --> 7818.46
be that [ __ ] it's been normalized

7815.659 --> 7821.369
people are just going oh that's cute or

7818.46 --> 7822.3
or whatever and not like what the hell

7821.369 --> 7825.898999999999
is wrong with you

7822.3 --> 7827.789
yeah it's normalized it's allowed it

7825.899 --> 7831.209000000001
it's just like the French nobility

7827.789 --> 7834.919
before the Revolution it all went

7831.209 --> 7837.749
completely perverted and [ __ ] and

7834.919 --> 7840.419
ninnies nanny-state dueling wasn't

7837.749 --> 7841.739
allowed anymore it was a total it was a

7840.419 --> 7845.519
what is it

7841.739 --> 7848.188999999999
yeah well it's typical because it's it's

7845.519 --> 7852.51
the same origins it's the the same crazy

7848.189 --> 7854.579000000001
leftist corruption yeah it's like it

7852.51 --> 7857.369000000001
went from being extremely what because

7854.579 --> 7859.709
back in the day it used to be like super

7857.369 --> 7862.169
duper structured like like you know like

7859.709 --> 7863.34
everyone like had to it's like you have

7862.169 --> 7865.079
to do this you have to go through you

7863.34 --> 7867.479
have to sit down and pay attention or

7865.079 --> 7869.728999999999
you know like if you misbehave you're

7867.479 --> 7870.899
gonna get punished and not just like sit

7869.729 --> 7873.269
in the corner but like you know they

7870.899 --> 7875.369000000001
used to paddle children back in the day

7873.269 --> 7876.929
and all that stuff now it's like the

7875.369 --> 7880.139
complete opposite of that now where

7876.929 --> 7883.579
teachers get punished for now like we're

7880.139 --> 7885.539
like teachers get punished for being

7883.579 --> 7887.749
disciplinarian for trying to get the

7885.539 --> 7890.429
children to pay attention for trying to

7887.749 --> 7893.459
it's like it's like a complete opposite

7890.429 --> 7895.11
now in this like no one they think that

7893.459 --> 7896.938999999999
the kids are developing better because

7895.11 --> 7899.61
of that and this not that's actually not

7896.939 --> 7903.659000000001
the case like children do need structure

7899.61 --> 7905.699
and order in order to learn and not like

7903.659 --> 7908.159
even thinking critically requires you to

7905.699 --> 7909.509999999999
have a structural foundation if you

7908.159 --> 7912.898999999999
don't have a shred of foundation you're

7909.51 --> 7916.469
just gonna be like oh right well they

7912.899 --> 7918.959000000001
need this daily discipline they need to

7916.469 --> 7920.82
contain the and test their social

7918.959 --> 7923.129
behaviors because especially teenagers

7920.82 --> 7925.829
and little kids they just they're

7923.129 --> 7930.119
learning how things work and they just

7925.829 --> 7933.539
test and challenge everything and they

7930.119 --> 7937.289
will not know normal borders at this so

7933.539 --> 7940.699
you need you can't just let them go

7937.289 --> 7943.709
insane you have to show them what is

7940.699 --> 7946.289
what is the thing you shouldn't be doing

7943.709 --> 7948.929
how to do things you have to do that you

7946.289 --> 7951.57
have to set this example as parents but

7948.929 --> 7954.059
teenagers really yeah tend to not listen

7951.57 --> 7955.739
to parents as much but if there is like

7954.059 --> 7957.959
a teacher that they really empathize

7955.739 --> 7959.5199999999995
with that they have a bond with then

7957.959 --> 7961.44
they'll be much more likely to

7959.52 --> 7963.540000000001
that advisor that kind of discipline

7961.44 --> 7965.91
from that teacher if they're lucky

7963.54 --> 7969.09
enough to get a bond with a teacher like

7965.91 --> 7974.46
that but if they're just gonna be

7969.09 --> 7978.12
corralled like a bunch of grown up

7974.46 --> 7979.83
babies by crazy Marxist teachers that

7978.12 --> 7984.53
are gonna just condition them in with

7979.83 --> 7993.36
insanity that's it's gonna be a mess

7984.53 --> 7995.4
that's right what I miss is James Toney

7993.36 --> 7997.74
it's not that it's not like you're

7995.4 --> 8000.11
talking about high screams education and

7997.74 --> 8001.46
it's rewrite the child or listen to a

8000.11 --> 8003.5
teacher more than they listen to his

8001.46 --> 8004.01
parents most of the time if they're a

8003.5 --> 8007.25
good teacher

8004.01 --> 8009.14
that's research after a certain age when

8007.25 --> 8011.45
the teen when the rebellion against

8009.14 --> 8013.22
their own Paras naturally arises they'll

8011.45 --> 8015.62
be much more likely to take advice from

8013.22 --> 8017.570000000001
a teacher than their own parents but in

8015.62 --> 8020.57
the preteen time that's not the case

8017.57 --> 8022.19
they will be more likely to listen to

8020.57 --> 8023.78
their parents if it's not blatantly

8022.19 --> 8024.71
obvious that their parents are retards

8023.78 --> 8027.38
and don't know what they're doing

8024.71 --> 8029.96
because a kid will pick up on that if

8027.38 --> 8032.12
that's the case if it were after like

8029.96 --> 8039.86
the age of eight they will definitely

8032.12 --> 8041.51
pick up on that maybe before like

8039.86 --> 8043.5199999999995
because I'm at transitional period where

8041.51 --> 8045.95
you are becoming a teenager you're going

8043.52 --> 8048.35
out in the world so your pairs at that

8045.95 --> 8052.49
point can't really do your parents job

8048.35 --> 8054.02
was to like take care of you like you

8052.49 --> 8056.599999999999
know like nurture you and take care of

8054.02 --> 8058.01
you till you got your sea legs not how

8056.6 --> 8059.33
you're going out into the world you're

8058.01 --> 8062.0
still gonna need your parents of course

8059.33 --> 8063.59
but like at that point you're going to

8062.0 --> 8065.06
need something outside of your parents

8063.59 --> 8066.53
so your parents can't control your every

8065.06 --> 8068.54
single move because now you're going

8066.53 --> 8070.25
towards adulthood all right so you do

8068.54 --> 8072.89
need another teacher for that part of

8070.25 --> 8074.78
life and like your teacher it can just

8072.89 --> 8077.09
you know not just a schoolteacher but it

8074.78 --> 8078.95
can be anyone like someone who's a

8077.09 --> 8081.92
mentor and it could even be your friend

8078.95 --> 8083.45
circle like people do who you associate

8081.92 --> 8085.9400000000005
yourself with that's when we start to

8083.45 --> 8091.01
you know bonds start to become more

8085.94 --> 8093.349999999999
important at that age yep so yeah sorry

8091.01 --> 8096.5
I'm so interrupted oh no no no your

8093.35 --> 8098.75
there are things generally teens

8096.5 --> 8101.24
especially that really are like

8098.75 --> 8104.24
exploring the world they tend to treat

8101.24 --> 8106.73
their parents not so much as teachers or

8104.24 --> 8109.73
parents even but just as an insurance

8106.73 --> 8112.459999999999
policy like they know they're really

8109.73 --> 8114.169999999999
testing things and they know like okay

8112.46 --> 8116.75
if things go totally wrong or something

8114.17 --> 8119.39
then I can fall back to my parents so

8116.75 --> 8123.47
they really use it more like a chip like

8119.39 --> 8125.660000000001
a back-up plan an insurance policy yeah

8123.47 --> 8127.55
because they're just want to do

8125.66 --> 8129.68
everything themselves and they think

8127.55 --> 8134.18
they can manage anything that's so

8129.68 --> 8136.46
typical teenagers yeah and that can be

8134.18 --> 8139.1
that can have its positive and negative

8136.46 --> 8141.74
they it's more up to me it's more so

8139.1 --> 8146.0
negative because you need like there's

8141.74 --> 8147.82
going to come a certain point where once

8146.0 --> 8150.2
you have your own structural foundation

8147.82 --> 8153.679999999999
and everything like that like eventually

8150.2 --> 8155.63
your parents are going to your parents

8153.68 --> 8157.76
are gonna need you like it's gonna turn

8155.63 --> 8159.68
all the way around like like you needed

8157.76 --> 8162.68
your parents for a period of time now

8159.68 --> 8164.360000000001
eventually when they get older like and

8162.68 --> 8167.450000000001
everything you're gonna need them and

8164.36 --> 8170.2699999999995
like to uphold that family structure as

8167.45 --> 8174.59
well like your parents are involved in

8170.27 --> 8176.150000000001
oh I'm sorry the new roles

8174.59 --> 8177.83
start to arise you get a different

8176.15 --> 8181.639999999999
relationship with your parents can be

8177.83 --> 8183.74
good or it can be less all depends I got

8181.64 --> 8189.320000000001
a much better relationship than with my

8183.74 --> 8192.5
dad after roughly 30 because before that

8189.32 --> 8195.051
I just was useless and now I'm older I'm

8192.5 --> 8197.09
much more developed and talkative and so

8195.051 --> 8200.17
is he in his own way and we kind of grew

8197.09 --> 8204.29
closer to one another and we can really

8200.17 --> 8206.69
help our each other evolve we're like

8204.29 --> 8208.970000000001
yeah I have my life mission he has his

8206.69 --> 8212.9
life mission and we have a relation and

8208.97 --> 8215.99
we really we can kind of teamwork that's

8212.9 --> 8217.94
great yeah very lucky very happy about

8215.99 --> 8220.369999999999
it because I thought I was never gonna

8217.94 --> 8223.1
have a real bad you know because he was

8220.37 --> 8225.08
just too distracted by his own things do

8223.1 --> 8226.09
you think in other debates or having

8225.08 --> 8229.72
your own

8226.09 --> 8236.59
divide show has has encouraged you to

8229.72 --> 8238.3
you know be more open talk more are you

8236.59 --> 8242.26
asking me I am yeah

8238.3 --> 8245.65
alright yeah well I'm always kind of

8242.26 --> 8249.61
have been used to be very open and

8245.65 --> 8252.22
direct about myself really explain

8249.61 --> 8254.08
myself very much very detailed and yeah

8252.22 --> 8255.699999999999
not a lot of people actually all really

8254.08 --> 8258.01
want to hear it some just sit through it

8255.7 --> 8264.880000000001
but I figured that out pretty quickly

8258.01 --> 8268.35
I'm very talky person sorry but I lost

8264.88 --> 8273.189999999999
track terrible what did you ask again

8268.35 --> 8277.380000000001
terrible it's just terrible news to many

8273.19 --> 8281.53
Kelly the chemtrail smoke spray in today

8277.38 --> 8283.24
know it I just I think I just said I

8281.53 --> 8285.37
basically asked did he give you the cop

8283.24 --> 8286.75
did did having your own show coming on

8285.37 --> 8288.460000000001
the debates give you the confidence to

8286.75 --> 8290.71
actually find yourself they don't speak

8288.46 --> 8294.4
out to be for you to get this

8290.71 --> 8296.619999999999
relationship we go hmm no my

8294.4 --> 8299.98
relationship with my dad came first

8296.62 --> 8303.85
definitely definitely first that's been

8299.98 --> 8306.46
going on for years like he literally

8303.85 --> 8309.49
kind of like rescued me when my axe

8306.46 --> 8311.47
dumped me threw me out and that

8309.49 --> 8313.66
reinforce it was already going better

8311.47 --> 8316.99
but that really forced us to get closer

8313.66 --> 8320.97
and yeah everything worked great since

8316.99 --> 8320.97
then but the show has definitely

8322.26 --> 8329.44
developed my own public face in doing

8328.12 --> 8331.42
the same thing because when you talk

8329.44 --> 8334.15
behind the scene behind the screen

8331.42 --> 8336.76
person-to-person private I literally can

8334.15 --> 8339.55
throw out very heavy things very heavy

8336.76 --> 8341.98
statements that'll be understand

8339.55 --> 8343.75
understood in its context by that

8341.98 --> 8346.119999999999
specific person but if you throw that

8343.75 --> 8347.92
out in the open public people be like

8346.12 --> 8349.900000000001
what the hell is that

8347.92 --> 8351.22
you know that's way too extreme more

8349.9 --> 8352.869999999999
complicated if they don't know

8351.22 --> 8356.59
everything about it on the right level

8352.87 --> 8359.730000000001
so I'm learning to basically now do the

8356.59 --> 8363.25
same thing but in a public set

8359.73 --> 8365.189999999999
knowing that every every one must be

8363.25 --> 8368.59
able to make some kind of sense of it

8365.19 --> 8370.390000000001
some kind what about you Jessica I mean

8368.59 --> 8372.55
I know you've come on the show well

8370.39 --> 8375.789999999999
you've been lying now for this is the

8372.55 --> 8377.74
day on the truck so you originally said

8375.79 --> 8380.140000000001
you were quite shy and a bit you know

8377.74 --> 8381.13
quiet but you seem to be speaking up a

8380.14 --> 8384.91
little bit more do you think this is

8381.13 --> 8386.8
giving you confidence it is like a lot

8384.91 --> 8388.18
of it has to do with I feel more

8386.8 --> 8390.311
comfortable with you guys

8388.18 --> 8391.48
so a lot of it like I'm not even really

8390.311 --> 8393.61
paying attention to the fact there's a

8391.48 --> 8395.350999999999
lot of people watching like because this

8393.61 --> 8397.181
you know like it's you know like

8395.351 --> 8398.74
watching the chat and everything like

8397.181 --> 8400.15
just the fact that I've communicated

8398.74 --> 8401.021
with you guys and I'm more comfortable

8400.15 --> 8403.561
with you all

8401.021 --> 8405.221000000001
it's helped with my confidence and

8403.561 --> 8407.71
speaking and everything like that

8405.221 --> 8409.619999999999
because if I was in front of a crowd I

8407.71 --> 8412.779999999999
would be climbing up a lot that would be

8409.62 --> 8414.490000000002
well because it's just we're just kind

8412.78 --> 8417.070000000002
of in a call and everything and I know

8414.49 --> 8419.471
you guys I feel more confident in

8417.07 --> 8421.42
speaking that's really cool

8419.471 --> 8423.971
give it a few a few more weeks as well

8421.42 --> 8425.011
you'll be you'll be taking that into the

8423.971 --> 8428.289999999999
real world as well

8425.011 --> 8430.12
yeah or it could go the other way

8428.29 --> 8431.710000000001
you might get the rumpus against your

8430.12 --> 8433.710000000001
anybody you read that much that you just

8431.71 --> 8439.99
think to yourself this guy's crazy and

8433.71 --> 8440.8
never come back on again gets on my

8439.99 --> 8445.9
nerves too much

8440.8 --> 8452.08
I won't even like have a car taking it

8445.9 --> 8457.21
that sounded really harsh probably

8452.08 --> 8459.55
probably yeah buying some sense you know

8457.21 --> 8461.589999999998
I mean I just saw something like when I

8459.55 --> 8464.4
in on Nathan's show one day and I do get

8461.59 --> 8468.011
into a conflict with a baller I'm I'm

8464.4 --> 8470.44
wondering how that's gonna go like the

8468.011 --> 8473.29
closest I got was cinder and

8470.44 --> 8476.561
I don't think cinder is really I don't

8473.29 --> 8478.78
know what's in there is honestly the

8476.561 --> 8480.58
main thing is on the debates obviously

8478.78 --> 8482.561000000002
you know if you don't really know

8480.58 --> 8484.21
anything when you get quote put into a

8482.561 --> 8487.57
corner there's generally somebody on

8484.21 --> 8489.939999999999
there that knows how to handle that

8487.57 --> 8490.9
situation for you so you know if you

8489.94 --> 8492.91
feel like you struggle

8490.9 --> 8495.73
don't don't worry because somebody will

8492.91 --> 8497.5
have your back and you will learn what

8495.73 --> 8499.721
will happen then is that you will feel

8497.5 --> 8502.12
that you was in that position you listen

8499.721 --> 8503.801
to how somebody else helped you get out

8502.12 --> 8505.841
of that situation you will remember it

8503.801 --> 8508.65
and the next time that question is posed

8505.841 --> 8511.78
to you you will know how to handle it

8508.65 --> 8514.21
yes oh by the way ad intervene

8511.78 --> 8516.67
clearly thank you for the $5 super chat

8514.21 --> 8519.58
donation much appreciated Cleary says

8516.67 --> 8525.101
lidar digital elevation models are the

8519.58 --> 8526.631
only way to prove Flat Earth hmm okay

8525.101 --> 8529.811
even then they wouldn't be popular

8526.631 --> 8531.760999999999
enough Oh a model unfortunately doesn't

8529.811 --> 8535.199999999999
actually abide by the scientific method

8531.761 --> 8540.04
but it's definitely gonna be good

8535.2 --> 8542.2
deduced empirical based information that

8540.04 --> 8546.330000000002
definitely will geometrically suggest

8542.2 --> 8546.33
that the earth is flat and not curved so

8546.57 --> 8553.15
unfortunately yeah like that's the thing

8550.511 --> 8554.98
that I feel like like you know like this

8553.15 --> 8557.949999999999
you know the argument the reification

8554.98 --> 8560.381
fallacy is that confusing a model with

8557.95 --> 8563.381000000001
reality but if your model I feel like if

8560.381 --> 8565.270999999999
your model is based on reality and there

8563.381 --> 8569.08
is scientific evidence to support that

8565.271 --> 8570.67
model like so like like versus the globe

8569.08 --> 8572.74
model which there's no scientific

8570.67 --> 8575.23
evidence to support it at all not even

8572.74 --> 8578.11
observational evidence like there's no

8575.23 --> 8580.600999999999
curvature there's no spin there's none

8578.11 --> 8582.82
of that stuff like so it's like so it's

8580.601 --> 8585.25
like you have a flat earth model that

8582.82 --> 8586.631
does match observation and scientific

8585.25 --> 8589.9
empirical evidence that would be a

8586.631 --> 8597.340999999999
really really strong way to you know win

8589.9 --> 8599.471
the debate in an actual model the main

8597.341 --> 8601.960000000001
thing I think we need to focus on right

8599.471 --> 8603.73
now is just showing the absurdity of the

8601.96 --> 8605.770999999999
globe and once we've got to that

8603.73 --> 8607.779999999999
position there's probably going to be

8605.771 --> 8610.061000000002
more people that join that have better

8607.78 --> 8614.891000000001
equipment more money more deeper pockets

8610.061 --> 8617.71
that can afford to advance the movement

8614.891 --> 8619.24
in terms of the tests and the

8617.71 --> 8621.010999999999
experiments that we actually could form

8619.24 --> 8622.899
because of the minute we're a very small

8621.011 --> 8624.429
voice that's it you know

8622.899 --> 8626.649
a very small voice but we know we're

8624.429 --> 8628.659
right and that's the thing we know we

8626.649 --> 8631.389
know we're correct but we look at we're

8628.659 --> 8633.009
facing an uphill battle so the main

8631.389 --> 8636.399
thing I think right now is just to just

8633.009 --> 8639.489
show how absurd the the the global model

8636.399 --> 8641.909
is you know people that take on NASA and

8639.489 --> 8644.288999999999
the moon landings and stuff like that

8641.909 --> 8647.409
absolutely brilliant you know there's a

8644.289 --> 8651.069000000001
lot a.m. bling-bling of the ISS you know

8647.409 --> 8654.878999999999
she's awesome subscribed to her and you

8651.069 --> 8657.698999999999
know just it's just like Tony's doing

8654.879 --> 8660.069000000001
like Tony's doing he's he's going after

8657.699 --> 8662.199
them on all their absurdities of how

8660.069 --> 8664.419
this doesn't work this doesn't work this

8662.199 --> 8666.85
doesn't work this is an alternative you

8664.419 --> 8668.979
know any faster to you

8666.85 --> 8673.089
I thought those of the curvature of the

8668.979 --> 8675.819
earth what would you say what would I

8673.089 --> 8677.919
say yeah if the globe became on and so I

8675.819 --> 8684.219
Steve bolts going over the curvature of

8677.919 --> 8689.079
the earth thank you by the way again

8684.219 --> 8692.31
Cleary $4 of donation models are used to

8689.079 --> 8697.029
visualize things that are too big to see

8692.31 --> 8700.839
sorry continue I would say did you take

8697.029 --> 8703.389000000001
into account perspective actually yeah

8700.839 --> 8705.579
look out because perspective causes and

8703.389 --> 8708.069
then that would explain they didn't

8705.579 --> 8710.798999999999
understand I want to keep my perspective

8708.069 --> 8713.649
there's a vanishing are you saying that

8710.799 --> 8716.919000000002
you see bolts going over the current

8713.649 --> 8718.628999999999
from the earth what like they're really

8716.919 --> 8720.909
going out of their view so it like let's

8718.629 --> 8722.889000000001
say you zoom in and the boat comes back

8720.909 --> 8724.179
into view explain that if they went over

8722.889 --> 8725.759
a carve you wouldn't have been able to

8724.179 --> 8727.479
zoom in it and it comes back into view

8725.759 --> 8730.929
yeah well then they'll come up with

8727.479 --> 8732.878999999999
pitches that they'll come up with

8730.929 --> 8736.6
pictures of support and a surgeon that

8732.879 --> 8737.919000000002
water is causing blockage and then how

8736.6 --> 8741.85
do you explain that had word half the

8737.919 --> 8743.378999999999
bolts missing this is my right this is

8741.85 --> 8746.889000000001
my thing and this is why that argument

8743.379 --> 8749.049
frustrates the hell out of me because do

8746.889 --> 8751.028999999999
people know what a curve is I don't

8749.049 --> 8753.369
think they do if something is goal if

8751.029 --> 8756.129
something is curving over first of all

8753.369 --> 8756.79
the people in this you know this is the

8756.129 --> 8760.479000000001
absurdity of that

8756.79 --> 8763.210000000001
the people on the ship shouldn't they be

8760.479 --> 8765.13
tilted over if you're going over a curve

8763.21 --> 8767.108999999999
and that's my like and that's why I

8765.13 --> 8768.938999999998
don't understand it's like it was like

8767.109 --> 8771.130000000001
like if we're on a curve things should

8768.939 --> 8773.5
be tilting over which means tell never

8771.13 --> 8775.479
is on that ship should be like oh god

8773.5 --> 8777.58
I'm tilting over what the hell is going

8775.479 --> 8779.289999999999
on and that and no one ever thinks about

8777.58 --> 8781.66
that like you have people who are

8779.29 --> 8783.37
selling all over and it's like they

8781.66 --> 8784.33
never and never said oh my god what's

8783.37 --> 8788.979000000001
going over the earth

8784.33 --> 8792.039999999999
oh never experience it because you are

8788.979 --> 8794.949999999999
always perpendicular to the center of

8792.04 --> 8796.960000000001
the earth in the distance you never see

8794.95 --> 8800.02
tilting that's a very good point that's

8796.96 --> 8801.64
never been observed ever be able to be

8800.02 --> 8803.319000000001
fair though because of the size of it I

8801.64 --> 8805.899
actually agree with the balls on this

8803.319 --> 8807.85
one that you would see tilt and if it

8805.899 --> 8809.68
was a couple of degrees but if it's

8807.85 --> 8811.210000000001
fractions of one degree you're never

8809.68 --> 8812.95
gonna perceive it because it's the size

8811.21 --> 8814.569
of the ball makes the amount of tilts

8812.95 --> 8817.93
that small that you'd never know it was

8814.569 --> 8820.449999999999
it so I do explanation for that one like

8817.93 --> 8823.029
how much of that's a total shot in the

8820.45 --> 8826.240000000002
foot right if you're selling for if

8823.029 --> 8828.37
you're sailing and you've gone five

8826.24 --> 8831.46
miles or ten

8828.37 --> 8834.1
I need like the tilt should still be

8831.46 --> 8836.649
obvious at a certain point and also like

8834.1 --> 8839.35
you pull over the country like there's

8836.649 --> 8841.42
this should be the the vertical drop so

8839.35 --> 8843.069
the blue there's the excuse me if the

8841.42 --> 8845.49
boat is going over the curvature of the

8843.069 --> 8848.979
earth the vertical drop should be

8845.49 --> 8851.319
visible from point A to point B like

8848.979 --> 8853.269999999999
from where the observer is standing and

8851.319 --> 8854.8
for wherever that boat is trying to

8853.27 --> 8857.77
travel to there should be that vertical

8854.8 --> 8859.99
drop yet there is not so it's like I

8857.77 --> 8862.569000000001
think you more likely to see the drop

8859.99 --> 8864.55
then you are the the tilt because the

8862.569 --> 8866.47
drop is you're looking down the length

8864.55 --> 8869.858999999999
of it on the z axis you you would see

8866.47 --> 8872.92
the drop every time upwards right water

8869.859 --> 8876.25
rising like that like they said the

8872.92 --> 8878.710000000001
water is rising up that's not vertical

8876.25 --> 8880.21
drop like especially if you like you're

8878.71 --> 8883.028999999999
saying that the things are over curves

8880.21 --> 8884.858999999999
but but you it's obviously perspective

8883.029 --> 8888.609
us maintain to account because you can

8884.859 --> 8890.35
see objects even further away beyond the

8888.609 --> 8890.74
position of the boats and whatever else

8890.35 --> 8892.36
you

8890.74 --> 8894.55
saying it's over the curve and that

8892.36 --> 8896.62
should be impossible if their boat was

8894.55 --> 8898.779999999999
already going over the cart so it's like

8896.62 --> 8902.380000000001
I don't understand the argument like

8898.78 --> 8904.84
after after like hundreds of miles or 50

8902.38 --> 8908.109999999999
miles that vertical drop should be taken

8904.84 --> 8909.43
into effect and also the the tilting

8908.11 --> 8911.68
again if that thing is on the side of

8909.43 --> 8912.76
the ball it should be tilting over you

8911.68 --> 8917.08
shouldn't even be able to see the top of

8912.76 --> 8919.9
it but they say they have the better way

8917.08 --> 8921.76
to argue that is both yet smaller as a

8919.9 --> 8924.1
function of distance that's perspective

8921.76 --> 8926.35
right what they also got dropped behind

8924.1 --> 8927.79
the curve but we see the boats are

8926.35 --> 8930.130000000001
getting smaller as a function of

8927.79 --> 8932.11
distance and we see the waves begin to

8930.13 --> 8933.759999999998
obstruct now you can't tell I'll beat

8932.11 --> 8935.35
that big the waves up because we only

8933.76 --> 8937.78
ever see the tops of the crest in waves

8935.35 --> 8938.95
the waves could be a foot or two and it

8937.78 --> 8940.54
could be three or four feet there could

8938.95 --> 8941.979000000001
be five or six feet you just don't know

8940.54 --> 8944.470000000001
how big the waves actually are unless

8941.979 --> 8945.599999999999
it's a Mill Pond but we do see the boats

8944.47 --> 8947.74
getting smaller and smaller and smaller

8945.6 --> 8949.87
but we also know that the angular

8947.74 --> 8952.75
resolution limitation of anything that's

8949.87 --> 8954.070000000002
got a lens has a limitation to it and

8952.75 --> 8955.36
that's the angle gets smaller and

8954.07 --> 8957.279999999999
smaller and smaller because of

8955.36 --> 8959.560000000001
perspective there comes a point where

8957.28 --> 8962.41
you are gonna start losing that that

8959.56 --> 8965.47
resolution and because of the thing that

8962.41 --> 8967.78
Nathan talks about and so what what the

8965.47 --> 8970.09
my point is that things get smaller and

8967.78 --> 8971.560000000001
are meant to drop the iron curve but we

8970.09 --> 8973.630000000001
don't see it we see things getting

8971.56 --> 8975.4
smaller and then we see things that they

8973.63 --> 8978.369999999999
tell us are curved but there are other

8975.4 --> 8980.109999999999
explanations for curve so they demand

8978.37 --> 8981.76
that it's curved we say nah those are

8980.11 --> 8983.08
the things that can cause this and it

8981.76 --> 8984.22
could be that there's a tide coming in

8983.08 --> 8985.96
at the time and it's got a bit of a

8984.22 --> 8988.179999999998
bulge on it doesn't mean it's curved

8985.96 --> 8991.479
they've got a show curve everywhere

8988.18 --> 8993.16
consistently reliably are always because

8991.479 --> 8995.349999999999
it's supposed to be a curve it's not

8993.16 --> 8997.33
what we're getting no so it's like just

8995.35 --> 9001.380000000001
remember that shoulding you get you get

8997.33 --> 9004.41
a vertical lift of the water in that

9001.38 --> 9007.92
location on both the incoming and

9004.41 --> 9009.42
outgoing time so it's always there apart

9007.92 --> 9012.27
from maybe when it seems most

9009.42 --> 9013.95
equilibrium at super high tide and super

9012.27 --> 9016.11
low tide but for the much you know for

9013.95 --> 9019.53
nets namsan at the time you've got this

9016.11 --> 9022.07
shoaling effect we're joined by

9019.53 --> 9025.070000000002
chocolate saying by the way they chose

9022.07 --> 9025.07
high

9025.31 --> 9041.55
hey hey yo Jogi you had work or okay

9038.58 --> 9043.08
yeah did you know he was joining or have

9041.55 --> 9044.789999999999
you just plucked him out of his whatever

9043.08 --> 9047.22
he was doing at the time now he joined

9044.79 --> 9049.29
the back panel on the hangouts but yeah

9047.22 --> 9055.679999999998
that it's not gonna work so I just added

9049.29 --> 9057.390000000001
him on skype when I mixed his name up

9055.68 --> 9062.67
and call them something different

9057.39 --> 9065.099999999999
Oh chocolate Asian chuckle a it does

9062.67 --> 9071.79
like chalk Asian okay when you glance at

9065.1 --> 9074.880000000001
it Jessica can I just stick my two

9071.79 --> 9076.2
pennyworth in on me what you were just

9074.88 --> 9079.229
talking about you and Riley though I

9076.2 --> 9081.560000000001
probably agree with Riley the the eight

9079.229 --> 9087.858999999999
inches per mile kind of figure the drop

9081.56 --> 9087.859
value would be obvious and optically

9088.52 --> 9094.229000000001
obvious prop simply but if you're

9091.02 --> 9097.5
talking about the effects of the the

9094.229 --> 9101.25
angular changes it is very small it's

9097.5 --> 9104.55
point zero zero eight nine per kilometer

9101.25 --> 9107.79
or I think it's point zero one four per

9104.55 --> 9110.099999999999
mile now they are just cumulative as

9107.79 --> 9111.990000000002
well because their angles so there's no

9110.1 --> 9114.359
squared function in there then you just

9111.99 --> 9118.289999999999
add them up per mile and that will give

9114.359 --> 9122.460000000001
you the angle of tilt away or if you're

9118.29 --> 9124.5
looking across the x-axis how point A to

9122.46 --> 9127.019999999999
point B what distance they should be but

9124.5 --> 9129.689
I say even at 50 miles you say yeah

9127.02 --> 9132.33
you're not really getting to a degree

9129.689 --> 9134.819
even you know what's the best thing that

9132.33 --> 9138.27
I found out recently the absolute best

9134.819 --> 9140.939
thing worked out for myself was if you

9138.27 --> 9143.630000000001
Adam listen to this if you if you have

9140.939 --> 9147.78
if you put your eyeball on the floor and

9143.63 --> 9149.608999999999
and somebody or some people measure out

9147.78 --> 9151.319000000001
completely flat surface for you for

9149.609 --> 9153.479000000001
three males so you've got a completely

9151.319 --> 9155.75
flat surface right completely flat

9153.479 --> 9158.39
surface and somebody stands at the

9155.75 --> 9160.46
whose six-foot Paul right and you've got

9158.39 --> 9162.439999999999
your eyeball at the start line and three

9160.46 --> 9163.669999999998
miles away you've got somebody stood

9162.44 --> 9165.710000000001
there at six feet tall

9163.67 --> 9167.78
do you know you will not be able to see

9165.71 --> 9170.770999999999
that because the angular resolution of

9167.78 --> 9174.5
that human that six feet tall human is

9170.771 --> 9181.640000000001
0.02 degrees and that's exactly the

9174.5 --> 9184.16
diffraction limit of the human eye how

9181.64 --> 9186.109999999999
cool is that it's one of those things

9184.16 --> 9188.45
that you think is is that how they back

9186.11 --> 9190.01
work the globe is because that would

9188.45 --> 9192.53
seem the most logical way that they

9190.01 --> 9194.09
worked it upon your eye and and stuff

9192.53 --> 9199.400000000001
like that but that's that's cool that

9194.09 --> 9201.86
that matches up exactly I'll say that

9199.4 --> 9205.82
geek you prefer that he'll like that one

9201.86 --> 9209.12
I think hope so hope so because it is

9205.82 --> 9210.949999999999
it's lit it really is well now when I

9209.12 --> 9213.29
actually decided to look into it and I

9210.95 --> 9215.54
found out I was like wow that is

9213.29 --> 9217.311000000002
literally the drop value of the

9215.54 --> 9220.04
curvature of the earth zero point zero

9217.311 --> 9222.59
two degrees from Ground Zero three males

9220.04 --> 9225.771
will give you the same circumference as

9222.59 --> 9227.87
the human eye the angular resolution of

9225.771 --> 9231.44
the human eye it's like that it that

9227.87 --> 9235.640000000001
can't be in any way shape or form you

9231.44 --> 9239.26
know whatever it's cut you know that

9235.64 --> 9241.850999999999
that's just not random I can't be random

9239.26 --> 9243.08
because if that's the case then you

9241.851 --> 9246.62
should be able to if you set your eye

9243.08 --> 9249.98
down and there's a six foot drop and is

9246.62 --> 9251.87
also the human and the human resolution

9249.98 --> 9254.75
of the human eye you shouldn't see

9251.87 --> 9257.210000000001
anything under 12 feet with a human eye

9254.75 --> 9264.59
because you'll have the drop compounded

9257.21 --> 9266.419999999998
with the angular resolution so I mean

9264.59 --> 9268.01
because it would have to drop first that

9266.42 --> 9269.66
human would have to drop first so you

9268.01 --> 9272.48
already wouldn't see it because the drop

9269.66 --> 9274.73
then you'd have to stick him another six

9272.48 --> 9276.32
foot high and you still want to see him

9274.73 --> 9277.369999999999
because it would still be too small with

9276.32 --> 9279.5
the human with the end from the

9277.37 --> 9282.380000000001
resolution so he'd have to stick another

9279.5 --> 9283.91
human on top of that to see him so he

9282.38 --> 9289.359999999999
would have to be 18 feet before you

9283.91 --> 9292.22
could see someone yeah I just

9289.36 --> 9293.811
yeah um that's the best very good point

9292.22 --> 9296.72
but I need to get tighter with the

9293.811 --> 9298.61
terminology when I am like oh because I

9296.72 --> 9302.029999999999
do I do understand it all I do

9298.61 --> 9303.62
understand it like to UM to a certain

9302.03 --> 9305.12
degree but Latin times we get in

9303.62 --> 9309.681
terminology like being able to throw out

9305.12 --> 9311.03
the degrees and the the the angular you

9309.681 --> 9313.220000000001
know formula and everything like that

9311.03 --> 9315.710000000001
act to be able to constantly bring that

9313.22 --> 9318.26
up in a debate I can I can bring it up

9315.71 --> 9320.689999999999
on and words I can talk about in words

9318.26 --> 9322.28
but in terms of like getting the math

9320.69 --> 9324.641
down which is for some reason that's the

9322.28 --> 9326.931
only thing follows it to listen to Oh

9324.641 --> 9330.65
like I would I would be able to

9326.931 --> 9332.960000000001
communicate that better if you want math

9330.65 --> 9335.48
other Meekins definitely the one you

9332.96 --> 9338.359999999999
want to go to because I guess so we

9335.48 --> 9339.92
don't without yeah what the way you just

9338.36 --> 9343.84
threw out the number like this there was

9339.92 --> 9351.97
nothing that was I need to get like that

9343.84 --> 9351.97
well I'll post you in this chat here the

9352.9 --> 9356.99
derivation curvature formula that I've

9355.7 --> 9360.86
derived that's where those numbers come

9356.99 --> 9362.181
from and you sound like you'll

9360.86 --> 9363.74
understand it so gives you a good

9362.181 --> 9365.78
understanding and being able to

9363.74 --> 9372.23
manipulate you or sending you over and

9365.78 --> 9373.91
then should we should be lagged out when

9372.23 --> 9380.59
he gets back and say you just been

9373.91 --> 9380.59
pawned you know there's not though

9385.75 --> 9394.61
speaking of which that lady that came on

9388.7 --> 9403.37
Nathan's Oh God I had a feeling you were

9394.61 --> 9405.681
gonna bring that up again well know

9403.37 --> 9407.660000000002
what's funny is I saw the comments like

9405.681 --> 9410.12
what's he uploaded the uncut an official

9407.66 --> 9411.86
version of it I saw the comments almost

9410.12 --> 9413.900000000001
said I hope this is the boobies episode

9411.86 --> 9417.550000000001
and I was like oh god it's gonna be

9413.9 --> 9417.55
remembered for that nothing else

9419.439 --> 9424.199
maybe it's holding on to the original

9421.6 --> 9430.569
law we won't release it

9424.199 --> 9433.209

9578.92 --> 9591.24
little bit of in the chat it's quite

9588.31 --> 9595.029999999999
refreshing though to have a lady join

9591.24 --> 9597.3
and be a willing participant because we

9595.03 --> 9600.49
do see them in the side chat too

9597.3 --> 9603.97
well yes it's nice that we absolutely

9600.49 --> 9606.369999999999
get a change because it's just men men's

9603.97 --> 9610.899
voices all the time and it's a bit yeah

9606.37 --> 9613.390000000001
we need more women in Flat Earth yeah

9610.899 --> 9616.75
so the room once in a while when Karen

9613.39 --> 9620.229
because a child - Karen B you missed

9616.75 --> 9642.07

9620.229 --> 9644.438999999998
yeah oh yeah yes the ladies it's like

9642.07 --> 9645.85
the ladies seem to have a different they

9644.439 --> 9650.17
always seem to bring something different

9645.85 --> 9653.17
you know and you know that the guys seem

9650.17 --> 9655.78
to get involved in in want rap track

9653.17 --> 9657.49
thoughts and we don't seem just to get

9655.78 --> 9659.35
it from the ladies side of you either

9657.49 --> 9660.82
but when they come in they've always got

9659.35 --> 9662.2
a different perspective and they've got

9660.82 --> 9664.27
a different way of saying stuff it makes

9662.2 --> 9667.87
you think differently so that's why I

9664.27 --> 9670.890000000001
encourage the ladies to join from my

9667.87 --> 9675.220000000001
line I agree 100%

9670.89 --> 9678.399
yep it cuts a fair bit of the macho

9675.22 --> 9682.96
[ __ ] down as well doesn't it yeah

9678.399 --> 9684.869999999999
now we have to behave yeah you notice

9682.96 --> 9688.929999999998
people actually do

9684.87 --> 9692.649000000001
this or a coupla gentleman still modify

9688.93 --> 9699.34
their I don't think it still scream like

9692.649 --> 9700.72
a little child eventually yeah I do

9699.34 --> 9702.130000000001
think you carry that weapon though

9700.72 --> 9705.149
Jessica certainly if somebody's engaging

9702.13 --> 9708.16
with you they're not going to be as

9705.149 --> 9710.199999999999
veralyn as they are with everybody helps

9708.16 --> 9711.119999999999
on the panel yeah everyone keeps saying

9710.2 --> 9716.68
that

9711.12 --> 9718.18
yeah use it might use it that way asking

9716.68 --> 9722.53
to be a little bit more blue if I want

9718.18 --> 9724.24
well I won't be too brutal but the

9722.53 --> 9725.2
others though there are some really

9724.24 --> 9727.3
nasty lady

9725.2 --> 9728.92
I mean Channel Q I don't if you've ever

9727.3 --> 9732.039999999999
come across a boy if you ever get into

9728.92 --> 9735.91
it you know one-on-one with her I mean

9732.04 --> 9738.550000000001
she can be real nasty I could just hear

9735.91 --> 9740.229
like what points with her points and she

9738.55 --> 9745.96
just starts to insult you like this ad

9740.229 --> 9752.56
humming oh she's she just vile she's

9745.96 --> 9754.569
whipped tongue no the one the one day

9752.56 --> 9759.25
she came on Nathan's and she lost her

9754.569 --> 9770.019999999999
mind it was literally like three minutes

9759.25 --> 9781.06
of just I think I think you know he was

9770.02 --> 9782.35
invoking sexes and then and I know I'll

9781.06 --> 9789.189
be back in two minutes are winning all

9782.35 --> 9791.68
right much Cherokee has her own channel

9789.189 --> 9793.12
so you might get an indication of what

9791.68 --> 9795.550000000001
she's like by watching if you have her

9793.12 --> 9798.87
videos but she's all she you know she's

9795.55 --> 9803.05
always file where some on panels

9798.87 --> 9804.880000000001
I just don't understand why you have to

9803.05 --> 9808.149
be so literal and and

9804.88 --> 9809.89
in disgusting like just you have a point

9808.149 --> 9812.83
if you know you're right you don't have

9809.89 --> 9816.189
to be like that you know I'm saying ends

9812.83 --> 9817.12
are like people just have to be nasty it

9816.189 --> 9817.91
doesn't make any sense

9817.12 --> 9821.410000000002
just

9817.91 --> 9828.41
was a globe that would it need defending

9821.41 --> 9832.58
exactly we do have about it would just

9828.41 --> 9834.5
be known right like the very fact that

9832.58 --> 9839.51
we're debating about it this is the

9834.5 --> 9841.851
problem we shouldn't you know what I

9839.51 --> 9845.210000000001
mean we live here we do wherever we are

9841.851 --> 9854.45
we live here too long to be debating so

9845.21 --> 9856.91
somebody gotta be mine yeah by reading

9854.45 --> 9858.68
the PowerPoint so what you think you

9856.91 --> 9863.061
could bring to the evolution discussion

9858.68 --> 9865.01
though oh I don't know I guess when it's

9863.061 --> 9866.539999999999
like open like for anyone's to make

9865.01 --> 9870.47
comments like I couldn't make comments

9866.54 --> 9873.92
on like my whole perspective on it okay

9870.47 --> 9875.689999999999
no II think so and I'd like I know a lot

9873.92 --> 9877.22
of them the reason why I'm excited about

9875.69 --> 9880.67
it because I know that Jon's gonna go

9877.22 --> 9882.439999999999
into biology and biochemistry a lot as

9880.67 --> 9883.94
well so that's another reason why I

9882.44 --> 9887.24
wanted to knit because I love those

9883.94 --> 9891.021
subjects but he said you say you to be

9887.24 --> 9895.13
mad yes well from three nursing pre-med

9891.021 --> 9901.210000000001
yep yeah that's funny I went to school

9895.13 --> 9903.83
for pre-med so oh oh I did finish it but

9901.21 --> 9912.5
that was the path that I was going on

9903.83 --> 9914.83
but it changed so Sanderson so far for

9912.5 --> 9917.84
me it's been a journey because I love

9914.83 --> 9920.03
like I've just I've been terms of school

9917.84 --> 9923.561
I've gone through a lot of different

9920.03 --> 9925.91
transitions like I was home-schooled for

9923.561 --> 9929.63
for a while for a long period of time

9925.91 --> 9932.8
and then I ended up not like messing up

9929.63 --> 9935.24
with that I had to get my GED and then

9932.8 --> 9937.73
then I started and I finally started my

9935.24 --> 9942.68
first year college and everything so

9937.73 --> 9944.99
it's been a journey for me like I'm

9942.68 --> 9947.29
trying to stay consistent now with

9944.99 --> 9947.289999999999
everything

9949.029 --> 9955.6
you her homeschools like in to what age

9955.959 --> 9961.189
18 18 Wow

9958.31 --> 9962.899
the followed the whole way well not not

9961.189 --> 9967.039
starting from kindergarten look like

9962.899 --> 9969.489
from kindergarten to the third grade I

9967.039 --> 9973.279
was in public school and I was bullied

9969.489 --> 9976.01
well a lot so my mom pulled me out and

9973.279 --> 9979.129
homeschooled me for two years then I

9976.01 --> 9983.27
started online school like you know at

9979.129 --> 9985.93
home I dough at 11 and then and then

9983.27 --> 9987.169
from 11 to 18 is how long I've been

9985.93 --> 9989.689
possible

9987.169 --> 9991.609
can I just kind of just interrupt before

9989.689 --> 9994.669
you say anything oh that anything more

9991.609 --> 9996.529
it's like be very very very very careful

9994.669 --> 9999.649
what you say over be the internet

9996.529 --> 10001.749
because believe it or not the trolls are

9999.649 --> 10004.239
listening and if they think that they

10001.749 --> 10006.579
can find some kind of weakness or make

10004.239 --> 10009.489
some kind of meme or a name of about you

10006.579 --> 10012.55
for something this is the kind of stuff

10009.489 --> 10014.739
that they'll want to actually play on so

10012.55 --> 10016.72
so yeah just be careful all I'm saying

10014.739 --> 10018.55
is from experience you know you need to

10016.72 --> 10021.429999999998
be really careful about what you want to

10018.55 --> 10023.019999999999
divulge between us offline it's grateful

10021.43 --> 10024.669
always be aware that you'd be in the

10023.02 --> 10026.589
Corps didn't know that the trolls will

10024.669 --> 10029.47
use this against you at some point if

10026.589 --> 10031.779
they think that can get onto novia I was

10029.47 --> 10034.448999999999
so glad that I wasn't even like I said

10031.779 --> 10036.640000000001
I'm not even I literally forgot that we

10034.449 --> 10038.77
were still alive the results I'm so

10036.64 --> 10043.149
excited we're still alive letters

10038.77 --> 10044.859
they're a good number 180 yeah just just

10043.149 --> 10046.51
be completely aware that they're always

10044.859 --> 10048.31
listening they're always write it down

10046.51 --> 10050.529
they'll have something it's not I've got

10048.31 --> 10052.81
a folder on people you know and things

10050.529 --> 10054.699
will be being scribbled down and if they

10052.81 --> 10056.169
come into de vega they'll suddenly turn

10054.699 --> 10059.02
around and say well you were home school

10056.169 --> 10060.52
from four years how do you know you know

10059.02 --> 10063.819000000001

see to not like young people say thanks

10088.39 --> 10091.38
for the slide Adam

10093.03 --> 10097.45
okay well that sucks

10094.811 --> 10099.43
um sort of thing everything I just said

10097.45 --> 10101.11
was totally made-up it was a lie that's

10099.43 --> 10110.74
nothing that's true actually

10101.11 --> 10112.57
oh god yeah by the way if there's

10110.74 --> 10114.789999999999
somebody out there that doesn't actually

10112.57 --> 10118.061
apply these rules you talked about

10114.79 --> 10121.390000000001
rentee it's like mark starting because

10118.061 --> 10124.05
he excels as at finding moments to

10121.39 --> 10127.350999999999
jokingly say the most outrageous things

10124.05 --> 10127.350999999999
it's weird

10130.62 --> 10139.601
full name and phone number out there you

10134.44 --> 10142.69
know like people just call him oh he

10139.601 --> 10144.7
does he's not exactly hiding no that's

10142.69 --> 10147.61
true he's just going for all in front a

10144.7 --> 10150.19
ssin that's true one thing I have

10147.61 --> 10151.51
noticed is that people do like oh there

10150.19 --> 10153.730000000001
are a lot of people want one person that

10151.51 --> 10159.880000000001
definitely does so hot is what's going

10153.73 --> 10163.359999999999
with Bob the Science Guy he goes at

10159.88 --> 10166.509999999998
Nathan a lot or his credentials as well

10163.36 --> 10168.640000000001
I notice he does that yet he didn't know

10166.51 --> 10170.53
like I remember that live show where he

10168.64 --> 10172.96
didn't where he was asked what is the

10170.53 --> 10175.390000000001
method and he could answer him and I'm

10172.96 --> 10178.21
like you realize how embarrassing that

10175.39 --> 10179.949999999999
is how somebody you the script ends up

10178.21 --> 10182.05
getting flipped on you you're saying

10179.95 --> 10183.311000000002
that oh well this person is just you

10182.05 --> 10185.619999999999
know they don't have any credentials

10183.311 --> 10186.851
they don't have PhDs blah blah but then

10185.62 --> 10189.79
when you were asked a very basic

10186.851 --> 10191.74
question you can answer it like you know

10189.79 --> 10194.26
what it is so it's not always that they

10191.74 --> 10196.601
can't answer the question sometimes it's

10194.26 --> 10198.460000000001
that they can answer it but they don't

10196.601 --> 10201.37
want to answer it because if they do

10198.46 --> 10204.22
answer it it will lead them into a trap

10201.37 --> 10209.021
that they can't get out of because their

10204.22 --> 10213.891
arses the rules are all same and they

10209.021 --> 10217.16
are any position hey one does not notice

10213.891 --> 10219.591
and then our friend writes they know how

10217.16 --> 10221.931
this goes this little back and forth

10219.591 --> 10223.91
it's like a little rap battle ain't goin

10221.931 --> 10227.511
back and forth right so they know how

10223.91 --> 10229.49
they know the steps but they don't want

10227.511 --> 10232.58
to lead themselves into a trap because

10229.49 --> 10235.699999999999
they don't have anything that could

10232.58 --> 10239.66
because I mean if they if it wasn't Loeb

10235.7 --> 10242.091
it would just be a globe I will not have

10239.66 --> 10244.789999999999
to defend it we would not be here

10242.091 --> 10246.2
debating it would have just been proven

10244.79 --> 10251.75
and we would have been on to other

10246.2 --> 10253.730000000001
things okay and they know this this is

10251.75 --> 10255.82
why most of them don't show up on the

10253.73 --> 10258.591
ins because you know would you wait

10255.82 --> 10260.36
nobody on the panel especially not

10258.591 --> 10263.57
Nathan is going to just sit there and

10260.36 --> 10266.511
let you tell us about some force that's

10263.57 --> 10269.21
not there you tell us how that's real or

10266.511 --> 10273.101
it's bending space-time or whatever none

10269.21 --> 10276.891
of that it's it's just not gonna work

10273.101 --> 10279.471000000001
doesn't like he doesn't like it one like

10276.891 --> 10282.109999999999
there are other presuppositions that are

10279.471 --> 10284.841
that are presented on me for our side as

10282.11 --> 10287.091
well because it just in it like we end

10284.841 --> 10289.091
up with Coco like he feels like that

10287.091 --> 10291.49
will cause a whole nother issue and then

10289.091 --> 10295.37
that'll because of it

10291.49 --> 10299.449999999999
we just entertain the [ __ ] it's to

10295.37 --> 10301.7
his cut it down to the basic to the

10299.45 --> 10305.480000000001
nitty-gritty of it this just we're not

10301.7 --> 10307.58
gonna you know you're not just gonna

10305.48 --> 10309.41
throw presuppositions all over the place

10307.58 --> 10315.41
it's just not the place for it

10309.41 --> 10319.011
you know we've got you off at pass they

10315.41 --> 10322.431
don't like it so how was the chat

10319.011 --> 10324.98
looking by the way not good it's not

10322.431 --> 10329.42
very active yeah I always have a very

10324.98 --> 10332.091
active chat it used to be different

10329.42 --> 10336.261
though but the currently seven no wait

10332.091 --> 10339.62
that's fifty for watching so that's

10336.261 --> 10344.601
pretty decent and I've also been looking

10339.62 --> 10347.12
that Jose has also is has been starting

10344.601 --> 10351.08
a panel 38 minutes ago with

10347.12 --> 10357.92
there's Brenda on there and that's he

10351.08 --> 10359.96
was an RAF Brenda's want to watch out

10357.92 --> 10369.29
for as well cause she'll just circle JQ

10359.96 --> 10372.74
around endlessly have you heard that yes

10369.29 --> 10376.78
whoo oh yeah I was talking about her the

10372.74 --> 10380.89
other day friend like my disgusted miss

10376.78 --> 10385.54
the fur yeah yes she's really a drone

10380.89 --> 10392.149
she just drones on same voice same

10385.54 --> 10394.52
system like a robot sometimes tell me

10392.149 --> 10396.32
when you can don't test her that she

10394.52 --> 10398.78
kind of shows sort of like common

10396.32 --> 10400.52
behavior social behavior but then when

10398.78 --> 10405.890000000001
you start to test her she starts to turn

10400.52 --> 10409.460000000001
into like a robot just droning on it's

10405.89 --> 10412.33
very typical well that's the proof of

10409.46 --> 10415.269999999999
gravity and she default automatically

10412.33 --> 10419.0
you know all the time to the same

10415.27 --> 10422.960000000001
quantum Hall experiment two balls in a

10419.0 --> 10425.96
shed you know and it's like this isn't

10422.96 --> 10428.779999999999
an experiment it's been proven hundreds

10425.96 --> 10433.82
of times that it isn't an experiment you

10428.78 --> 10435.62
know and she still just refuses to to

10433.82 --> 10438.25
move from that point it's like she has

10435.62 --> 10440.960000000001
her position and she's unwilling to even

10438.25 --> 10441.59
even - you know contemplate being

10440.96 --> 10446.39
different

10441.59 --> 10450.04
you know it's frustrating because this

10446.39 --> 10453.279999999999
is the typical world but this is that it

10450.04 --> 10456.710000000001
it's like are these people so

10453.28 --> 10458.479000000001
indoctrinated that they can look I can't

10456.71 --> 10461.419999999998
look at and it's somebody's work and

10458.479 --> 10463.49
having an independent thought about what

10461.42 --> 10466.67
is presenting in front of them and then

10463.49 --> 10469.13
way up and say okay this is what we've

10466.67 --> 10470.66
been told this is what is presented

10469.13 --> 10472.759999999998
right now

10470.66 --> 10474.47
let's see which one was the most worthy

10472.76 --> 10477.68
you know it seems like they don't even

10474.47 --> 10481.06
want to you know go into that debate you

10477.68 --> 10481.06
know the sole closed-minded

10481.33 --> 10489.32
hmm yep they just want to be allowed to

10486.98 --> 10493.251
presuppose everything and they all agree

10489.32 --> 10496.221
upon how that works so they create their

10493.251 --> 10499.521
own presuppositional realm of theorizing

10496.221 --> 10502.341
the science fiction realm but so many

10499.521 --> 10504.41
people are used to what I know how to

10502.341 --> 10508.431
deal with that I've done it I'm very

10504.41 --> 10511.431
good at it I think so

10508.431 --> 10514.16
I know how that works I think I can just

10511.431 --> 10517.011
shove in there and become part of it and

10514.16 --> 10518.99
even ask them intricate questions about

10517.011 --> 10522.08
the details of doing the presupposition

10518.99 --> 10524.811
a model and they do kind of appreciate

10522.08 --> 10526.181
that but they can't move outside of it

10524.811 --> 10529.49
that's their issue

10526.181 --> 10532.301000000001
they just can't not presuppose that

10529.49 --> 10535.851
model they just can't do it

10532.301 --> 10536.391
and I need to drop guys and I'll see you

10535.851 --> 10539.601
all later

10536.391 --> 10548.359999999999
guys and girls sorry see all right there

10539.601 --> 10551.301000000001
auntie thanks for popping by oh I'm

10548.36 --> 10553.641000000001
sorry I I can't stop thinking about what

10551.301 --> 10555.850999999999
he said I feel like it's a little idiot

10553.641 --> 10559.461
I can't stop thinking about it

10555.851 --> 10561.561
what do you mean oh about what he said

10559.461 --> 10564.289999999999
about um you know when I said all that

10561.561 --> 10566.449999999999
stuff earlier well my personal stuff I

10564.29 --> 10571.881000000001
really wish I hadn't said anything like

10566.45 --> 10574.511
I just yeah but I worry about just know

10571.881 --> 10577.551
you really have nothing to shame for

10574.511 --> 10580.19
because you're you seem to be doing

10577.551 --> 10582.260999999999
great that's really more important the

10580.19 --> 10584.87
confidence part is much more important

10582.261 --> 10587.421
and it is also what frustrates and

10584.87 --> 10590.240000000002
brings in the trolls but it is also the

10587.421 --> 10594.261
best defense what I've experienced so

10590.24 --> 10597.86
far is that at first I would be pretty

10594.261 --> 10599.961000000001
closed off and I will get some trolls

10597.86 --> 10602.78
but the more I showed of myself the more

10599.961 --> 10606.98
trolls I got and they're just constantly

10602.78 --> 10610.37
testing me and like they're trying to

10606.98 --> 10613.609999999999
damage me I'm trying to use that to spar

10610.37 --> 10615.95
with for my own personal development

10613.61 --> 10619.311
so it's all a matter of perspective and

10615.95 --> 10621.561000000002
you just it's just a general concept

10619.311 --> 10624.35
that you don't want to behave bad

10621.561 --> 10625.4
whether it is out of the public eye or

10624.35 --> 10627.74
in the public eye

10625.4 --> 10631.34
so as long as you just follow that and

10627.74 --> 10633.86
just be a good person and be follow the

10631.34 --> 10636.41
right principles it there will never be

10633.86 --> 10640.311
a problem even improvising on the air

10636.41 --> 10642.05
and that's how I do things and if you

10640.311 --> 10645.74
make a mistake correct it just

10642.05 --> 10648.41
immediately don't don't hide behind any

10645.74 --> 10650.69
pride or anything but I think you have

10648.41 --> 10653.0
probably have a lot of natural wisdom

10650.69 --> 10658.54
and already do these things by default

10653.0 --> 10659.9
that's my my my suspicions about you

10658.54 --> 10662.12
Jessica

10659.9 --> 10669.8
so I wouldn't worry too much said my

10662.12 --> 10672.140000000001
what things that what position of you is

10669.8 --> 10674.3
that's what he that means I'm not

10672.14 --> 10677.84
suspicious of you absolutely no no I

10674.3 --> 10683.029999999999
think I suspect that you have just a

10677.84 --> 10685.7
natural talent to uphold logos as Bowen

10683.03 --> 10687.650000000001
Benjamin would say so you can just be

10685.7 --> 10689.990000000002
yourself in public because you're not

10687.65 --> 10691.94
sneaky and hiding things you're being

10689.99 --> 10694.67
yourself fully and you're just following

10691.94 --> 10696.710000000001
good principles and as long as you do

10694.67 --> 10698.84
that nothing can really go wrong not

10696.71 --> 10702.109999999999
really although it will bring in more

10698.84 --> 10706.97
trolls because they hate it when people

10702.11 --> 10709.76
are doing it right in the open and at

10706.97 --> 10719.449999999999
the end of the day the earth is not

10709.76 --> 10720.29
spinning okay we could debate all that

10719.45 --> 10723.320000000002
tonight

10720.29 --> 10725.78
oh we all go to sleep tonight or if will

10723.32 --> 10729.05
still not be spinning and it still will

10725.78 --> 10733.1
be no curvature and we still won't be

10729.05 --> 10735.89
flying around in a vacuum so you mind if

10733.1 --> 10736.79
I read the definition of longest cuz I

10735.89 --> 10742.49
thought it was interesting

10736.79 --> 10743.811000000002
sure okay oh there's like okay there's

10742.49 --> 10746.631
like two definitions I'm just gonna

10743.811 --> 10749.841
ignore that one so long

10746.631 --> 10751.82
so one of so one of them from a noun and

10749.841 --> 10754.07
it's used a lot in theology I just

10751.82 --> 10757.251
realize like like it says the Word of

10754.07 --> 10760.4
God or principle of divine reasoning

10757.251 --> 10762.351
creative order identified in the Gospel

10760.4 --> 10766.100999999999
of John with the second person of the

10762.351 --> 10769.011
Trinity incarnate in Jesus Christ that's

10766.101 --> 10771.881000000001
so that's not they define logos but I

10769.011 --> 10773.99
like I've heard it also used in a

10771.881 --> 10776.331
literature like when you're when you're

10773.99 --> 10778.57
trying to conduct an argument like one

10776.331 --> 10782.301
of the things that you use is like

10778.57 --> 10784.431
locusts like you're using your arm your

10782.301 --> 10787.100999999999
principal your reasonable judgment

10784.431 --> 10788.66
against something and they're like that

10787.101 --> 10791.811
basically that's it is it's like and the

10788.66 --> 10794.15
spiritual frequency look the method the

10791.811 --> 10796.311
method and the principles they have

10794.15 --> 10798.74
frequencies method and principles have

10796.311 --> 10804.19
frequency in the spectrum of the Spirit

10798.74 --> 10806.99
and of how yeah how the Spirit works and

10804.19 --> 10810.801000000001
if you just follow the right one you

10806.99 --> 10812.751
will start to go on a specific path the

10810.801 --> 10816.831
path of Christ which is a very narrow

10812.751 --> 10820.761
frequency with all the effects that come

10816.831 --> 10825.051
from being in that frequency that's how

10820.761 --> 10829.251
I see it yeah and I think that you're

10825.051 --> 10831.859999999999
naturally doing a great job so far so

10829.251 --> 10834.23
far as I've seen to be fair I I think

10831.86 --> 10836.331
you just said that you said some things

10834.23 --> 10838.699999999999
that you might regret I might have been

10836.331 --> 10840.74
out of the room when you said those so I

10838.7 --> 10845.331
have no idea exactly what you supposed

10840.74 --> 10850.721
II said because I my personal

10845.331 --> 10853.49
credentials in regards to my educational

10850.721 --> 10855.680999999999
like and in regards to education I had

10853.49 --> 10858.171
said it and I said it in such a way

10855.681 --> 10860.12
where at length it was like I was so

10858.171 --> 10862.641
comfortable when I said it I didn't

10860.12 --> 10865.490000000002
necessarily think twice about it and

10862.641 --> 10868.461
then Rael not Riley but ranty said and I

10865.49 --> 10870.021
was like you have to be careful because

10868.461 --> 10871.251
there are chose who are listening they

10870.021 --> 10872.931
can use it against you and he's

10871.251 --> 10876.591
absolutely right about that that's why I

10872.931 --> 10878.931
was kind of like oh this Hawks awareness

10876.591 --> 10881.54
basically Doc's awareness

10878.931 --> 10883.82
yes and I pray I appreciate that I

10881.54 --> 10885.801000000001
appreciate him keeping me aware I just

10883.82 --> 10887.301
feel so like oh my god wasn't it do that

10885.801 --> 10889.609999999999
you know but I have to let that go

10887.301 --> 10893.841
this stuff happens you can't change it

10889.61 --> 10895.37
yeah it's kind of stupid I we we or I we

10893.841 --> 10898.101
talked before I should have probably

10895.37 --> 10899.960000000001
just told you because I'm so used to

10898.101 --> 10902.69
this you know I've been online doing

10899.96 --> 10905.33
things for three years Daily Show for a

10902.69 --> 10907.19
half a year almost so I'm just used to

10905.33 --> 10909.92
like yeah of course that's how you do

10907.19 --> 10911.66
things but you're new so you know you

10909.92 --> 10914.45
really just arrived on the scene so

10911.66 --> 10917.15
you're not used to the medium yet to how

10914.45 --> 10918.95
that works and yeah it's good that rents

10917.15 --> 10921.109999999999
me remind you we I should have reminded

10918.95 --> 10924.61
you before that even but I forgot worse

10921.11 --> 10927.381000000001
a scenario oh I mean one before you

10924.61 --> 10929.75
upload this I guess maybe if you want it

10927.381 --> 10936.051
taken out maybe our link to edit it out

10929.75 --> 10940.221
or something if yeah cuz I said that it

10936.051 --> 10943.760999999999
really here too much of it so I don't

10940.221 --> 10949.189999999999
know exactly what it is that you said as

10943.761 --> 10951.44
far as the potentials but yeah if you

10949.19 --> 10954.2
want to you don't have to honestly like

10951.44 --> 10958.16
it is what it is but if you want to you

10954.2 --> 10961.521
can do that like I okay you go I just

10958.16 --> 10963.86
don't have to if you're not able to you

10961.521 --> 10965.66
know what just listen when when we're

10963.86 --> 10967.7

10970.58 --> 10974.57
out soon

10971.21 --> 10977.24
so what after it's been fully processed

10974.57 --> 10978.92
just listen back try to find the moment

10977.24 --> 10982.851
where you said it and listen to it and

10978.92 --> 10984.98
if you still want it yeah you feel

10982.851 --> 10987.29
uncomfortable with it then I'll try to

10984.98 --> 10989.359999999999
edit it out with the YouTube editor but

10987.29 --> 10993.53
if you know depends on how much of it

10989.36 --> 10995.841
even came across so it was pretty

10993.53 --> 10999.381000000001
detailed like whether like I started off

10995.841 --> 11002.17
very early and then came to now and like

10999.381 --> 11005.74
you know like what I had to do me

11002.17 --> 11007.66
getting you know I'm how do you want to

11005.74 --> 11010.631
say it again you know you don't just

11007.66 --> 11012.85
