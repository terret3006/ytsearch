6.51 --> 36.589999999999996
[Music]

36.719 --> 44.199
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.69 --> 46.059
early-bird number 223 I'm your host

44.199 --> 47.678999999999995
Arwen and before we start the show

46.059 --> 49.989
please don't forget to share it on any

47.679 --> 51.309000000000005
platform you deem fit and also if you

49.989 --> 53.199
haven't already subscribed to my channel

51.309 --> 54.939
and hit the bell notification so know

53.199 --> 57.519
you know when I'm going live which is

54.939 --> 59.71
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

57.519 --> 62.429
day today I'm a little bit late because

59.71 --> 65.74
I was very much preoccupied and it's

62.429 --> 67.479
freaking hot out here so yeah also

65.74 --> 71.33999999999999
please support my show through the

67.479 --> 76.78
various ways superjet paypal patreon and

71.34 --> 79.03
GoFundMe right so yeah it is yeah I

76.78 --> 82.509
think they are kind of countering a

79.03 --> 86.17
little you can see one there although

82.509 --> 89.459
yeah I don't know it might be a contrail

86.17 --> 92.67
after all it's just it's very moist and

89.459 --> 95.35000000000001
extremely hot and yeah there's not much

92.67 --> 99.33
serious cloud it's all just this weird

95.35 --> 106.44999999999999
hazy stuff doesn't really block much Sun

99.33 --> 109.84
it's really hot and yeah this is like

106.45 --> 114.759
the type of weather where we start to

109.84 --> 118.66
walk around in bikinis and [ __ ] which is

114.759 --> 124.83
pretty amusing so today I got with me

118.66 --> 124.83
tumeric coffee and tea that's it

128.09 --> 136.68
so yeah I've been preoccupied with the

131.31 --> 140.7
heat and then with Daniel that is it's

136.68 --> 144.06
tough to say I kind of do appreciate it

140.7 --> 146.39999999999998
but you can't have these moods where he

144.06 --> 149.81900000000002
just keeps on nagging and nagging and

146.4 --> 152.61
nagging and he just keeps some posting

149.819 --> 154.61999999999998
these posts and chatting and just goes

152.61 --> 156.62
on it just drives me nuts

154.62 --> 159.3
[Music]

156.62 --> 161.25
it doesn't know how to hold back and he

159.3 --> 164.93
and it keeps on doing the same kind of

161.25 --> 168.66
stupid stuff also like small

164.93 --> 172.97
interpretation mistakes that just make

168.66 --> 172.97
everything unnecessarily complicated

174.86 --> 179.67000000000002
yeah I wasn't talking about Daniel left

179.04 --> 181.82999999999998
50a

179.67 --> 187.94
by the way I was talking about Daniel

181.83 --> 191.57000000000002
Daniel so the one with the purple icon

187.94 --> 194.53
don't worry about it Daniel

191.57 --> 202.06
[Music]

194.53 --> 205.54
right so yeah sorry I again it's so hot

202.06 --> 209.2
it might a little bit better later on in

205.54 --> 212.64
the show because the Sun is just become

209.2 --> 216.57999999999998
perpendicular to my window so it is

212.64 --> 219.23999999999998
gradually cooling off I had still very

216.58 --> 219.24
warm in here

222.45 --> 228.04
yeah I know super curved don't don't get

226.63 --> 231.13
cheeky with me okay

228.04 --> 233.62
I know exactly what Daniel does and it

231.13 --> 235.69
is because he asks detailed questions

233.62 --> 237.79
that I do actually appreciate it if he

235.69 --> 239.77
wouldn't I would have ban him

237.79 --> 247.62
permanently a long time ago because of

239.77 --> 247.62
its just nagging okay so

255.35 --> 265.53
yeah little Major Tom but not really

260.51 --> 268.28
because yes Persky like you might have

265.53 --> 272.01
taken notice that yeah I went on a 101

268.28 --> 275.36999999999995
yesterday on Jose's whispers chemo which

272.01 --> 278.73
I specifically asked for and I basically

275.37 --> 281.61
gave him some heartfelt advice and a

278.73 --> 287.46000000000004
warning I don't know if you made it made

281.61 --> 289.62
it out if you care and that was also

287.46 --> 292.04999999999995
with a little bit of agitation because I

289.62 --> 295.59000000000003
was being pissed off of what he was

292.05 --> 302.33
doing and then he proceeded to basically

295.59 --> 305.82
bring in this insane political strategy

302.33 --> 308.7
literally like what politicians do bring

305.82 --> 312.78
in a red herring that has absolutely no

308.7 --> 317.09
direct relevance but that by bringing

312.78 --> 320.48999999999995
that subject up instigates slander and

317.09 --> 321.63
that is what he did and he's not dumb

320.49 --> 325.68
okay

321.63 --> 328.1
his first chemo is not dumb he knows

325.68 --> 333.57
what he's doing I think he's a creep I

328.1 --> 336.96000000000004
think he's an absolute creep and he

333.57 --> 339.09
doesn't respond he doesn't respond with

336.96 --> 340.62
feelings you might have noticed they

339.09 --> 345.17999999999995
dress him really personally he's

340.62 --> 348.96
untouchable okay he's not strong no he's

345.18 --> 352.44
untouchable it doesn't touch him at all

348.96 --> 357.12
and he just continues on with he's kind

352.44 --> 361.68
of like a rumpus but much much much more

357.12 --> 364.29
focused much more in control of his

361.68 --> 369.72
emotions but he's kind of doing the same

364.29 --> 372.90000000000003
thing I think he disrupts conversations

369.72 --> 375.72
and then yeah he uses these kind of

372.9 --> 379.14
weird devious tactics that are just

375.72 --> 381.72
completely irrelevant like what the hell

379.14 --> 383.2
does it matter what a bunch of freaks on

381.72 --> 388.45000000000005
this card

383.2 --> 391.78
start talking about right because yeah

388.45 --> 394.18
we all know if we had some contact with

391.78 --> 396.7
this card or heard about it that the

394.18 --> 400.99
most crazy [ __ ] is being said there and

396.7 --> 405.64
there's like creepy cultish behavior and

400.99 --> 408.34000000000003
like massive slander like a list of

405.64 --> 411.34
slander that is just so insane

408.34 --> 415.59999999999997
and while sparse chemo didn't bring that

411.34 --> 419.73999999999995
one up so what's the real relevance was

415.6 --> 422.86
it just to deflect the attention in the

419.74 --> 425.2
very moment from serious personal

422.86 --> 428.68
criticism and advice to him in his

425.2 --> 431.05
character to deflect it on something

428.68 --> 434.17
that could potentially worry me mainly

431.05 --> 436.96000000000004
oh people think that I might be doing

434.17 --> 438.88
this for money and I should worry about

436.96 --> 442.78
that that's what he did

438.88 --> 445.84
it's freaking sociopath manipulation

442.78 --> 449.22999999999996
that is what that is and I got pissed

445.84 --> 452.65
off and he proceeded like but no I

449.23 --> 456.07
didn't say I did that I just brought it

452.65 --> 458.71
up just coincidental it's just you might

456.07 --> 462.34
want to know mm-hmm it's not

458.71 --> 465.01
manipulative at all I'm scheme oh right

462.34 --> 466.69
and then every single time after that

465.01 --> 471.73
you address me that you bring it up

466.69 --> 474.55
again also so relevant it's it's not a

471.73 --> 478.18
devious manipulation tactic at all is

474.55 --> 482.83
its purse chemo right you're a creep and

478.18 --> 485.76
I'm calling you out okay and I will keep

482.83 --> 490.47999999999996
on doing that because I caught you I

485.76 --> 495.03
caught you you're a freak and you derail

490.48 --> 495.03000000000003
things and you're not natural

497.87 --> 502.58
and I don't give a [ __ ] what baller say

500.36 --> 505.97
okay the amount of [ __ ] that's gone

502.58 --> 509.69
around concerning me if I'd even try to

505.97 --> 512.539
like account for it that'd be a lifetime

509.69 --> 515.51
work okay there's like hundreds of

512.539 --> 518.75
insane troll videos about me that have

515.51 --> 520.3
piled up over the years some are sort of

518.75 --> 530.06
kind of funny most are just really

520.3 --> 532.37
creepy right so why why would I care why

530.06 --> 537.14
would express chemo bring that up it's

532.37 --> 539.8100000000001
just it's an obvious devious tactic to

537.14 --> 543.17
derail the moment and to deviate the

539.81 --> 546.8299999999999
current attention of my well focused

543.17 --> 548.9599999999999
criticism to his character onto some

546.83 --> 552.32
kind of guilt trip instigation with me

548.96 --> 555.08
and I got pissed off not because I felt

552.32 --> 557.12
guilty about the money and I absolutely

555.08 --> 560.0600000000001
explained that afterward like yeah I I

557.12 --> 562.94
need this because I invest a lot of my

560.06 --> 565.9399999999999
energy and time and mind into all of

562.94 --> 568.0100000000001
this and I need something to support me

565.94 --> 570.2600000000001
because my financial situation can't

568.01 --> 573.85
accommodate for that just like that and

570.26 --> 578.0889999999999
that's just a fact and I don't like that

573.85 --> 581.39
right but he keeps on whining on about

578.089 --> 583.2790000000001
it and I got really pissed off not not

581.39 --> 587.51
so much because I feel attacked

583.279 --> 589.3389999999999
but because he is literally deviating

587.51 --> 592.55
from the original criticism and up to a

589.339 --> 594.82
point where right then I did get worked

592.55 --> 597.5889999999999
up enough that I actually really forgot

594.82 --> 601.339
the details of what I even said in my

597.589 --> 603.4590000000001
criticism and probably so did he and he

601.339 --> 605.9000000000001
did it just for that reason

603.459 --> 611.4499999999999
because I think he is probably a

605.9 --> 614.959
sociopath and he does not or he refutes

611.45 --> 616.7900000000001
that even refuses he refutes to be

614.959 --> 620.3
addressed there's some other people like

616.79 --> 622.52
that - like Antonius uber rats he's

620.3 --> 625.8499999999999
great at it maybe but he's much better

622.52 --> 628.62
like he can actually

625.85 --> 631.2
put his things down be somewhat

628.62 --> 634.47
reasonable in a controlled fashion up to

631.2 --> 636.6600000000001
certain limits as much as his ego will

634.47 --> 639.63
allow him if you see some benefit it is

636.66 --> 641.28
very strategical headed spur scheme oh I

639.63 --> 643.4399999999999
don't know I don't know him for that

641.28 --> 646.53
long I think he's a little bit more

643.44 --> 650.19
basic in his methodology so I don't

646.53 --> 653.37
think he is like an evil schemer that's

650.19 --> 656.61
really here to like create a cult or

653.37 --> 658.71
something but he has these tendencies I

656.61 --> 660.87
think and I'm already threading on way

658.71 --> 663.6
too personal ground so I don't even know

660.87 --> 667.41
them that well this is my my rough

663.6 --> 671.75
analysis on the first layer first tier

667.41 --> 671.75
analysis and

677.19 --> 683.0300000000001
I don't know I really get the feeling

680.04 --> 683.03
he's just

686.53 --> 692.38
I get really creepy feeling sometimes

688.98 --> 695.29
with when he does his thing in between

692.38 --> 700.33
the ballers because he lets them Walsh

695.29 --> 702.9699999999999
and [ __ ] and barf all over him and all

700.33 --> 704.59
over flat earthers as much as they like

702.97 --> 707.5600000000001
and it's almost like he seems to enjoy

704.59 --> 711.73
it I'm not saying that he hates flat

707.56 --> 713.9399999999999
earthers okay I'm saying is that he I

711.73 --> 718.27
don't know there seems to be this weird

713.94 --> 721.8900000000001
enjoyment of being in the presence of

718.27 --> 725.59
that it's I find him just very creepy

721.89 --> 729.58
and I don't appreciate his presence

725.59 --> 734.47
really in the debates I don't like my

729.58 --> 736.24
discussions with him even because he's

734.47 --> 738.7900000000001
rarely even addressed anything I

736.24 --> 741.34
literally say unless I make a very short

738.79 --> 744.91
point within some argument but when I

741.34 --> 751.62
bring up new points he does the same

744.91 --> 751.62
[ __ ] he deviates with refined tactics

752.0 --> 755.149
[Music]

761.03 --> 764.169
[Music]

766.75 --> 771.43
yeah yeah but Daniel the thing about

769.36 --> 773.9490000000001
that is is that the law of

771.43 --> 779.1099999999999
thermodynamics that's just what it is

773.949 --> 781.269
and look if you want me to absolutely

779.11 --> 783.73
teach you about that [ __ ] you're gonna

781.269 --> 788.069
have to come and visit me and then pay

783.73 --> 788.0690000000001
me and I'll take a week and really

788.25 --> 796.66
really explain it and show it to you

791.31 --> 799.0889999999999
alright but I kind of not gonna do that

796.66 --> 801.129
with so much time on one person that

799.089 --> 804.2790000000001
just refuses to get it well I am

801.129 --> 806.8290000000001
definitely educated about this way

804.279 --> 810.069
before Flat Earth to me it doesn't even

806.829 --> 812.439
have anything to do with Flat Earth only

810.069 --> 814.99
has to do with the concept of outer

812.439 --> 817.329
space really and I don't really care

814.99 --> 820.87
what the shape of the planet is in

817.329 --> 824.05
relation to that concept at all because

820.87 --> 828.87
I I had that argument I learned that way

824.05 --> 831.79
before twenty-five years ago by very

828.87 --> 836.79
very good teachers that were extremely

831.79 --> 840.16
smart and very ethical in correctness so

836.79 --> 842.529
I'm sorry if you don't like it I'm sorry

840.16 --> 845.35
if you know physicists and whatever

842.529 --> 847.059
ballers that go all over the place and

845.35 --> 850.5690000000001
you've been fooled into believing that

847.059 --> 855.639
that's normal because yeah you've been

850.569 --> 859.959
misled it's not it's not normal laws of

855.639 --> 862.389
physics are very much strict and if you

859.959 --> 865.0
don't respect that if you don't care if

862.389 --> 867.1
you're gonna work your way around get

865.0 --> 869.62
some other writing where these details

867.1 --> 871.62
are not included or where it's not

869.62 --> 875.889
emphasized that there are logical

871.62 --> 877.93
yeah logical consequences of it when

875.889 --> 879.97
that's not addressed then it's very easy

877.93 --> 881.949
to ignore and then imagine that it

879.97 --> 884.86
actually can work other ways that's very

881.949 --> 888.37
nice okay but that's called not having

884.86 --> 891.819
the complete information yet google it

888.37 --> 895.679
oh because Google is be perfect arbiter

891.819 --> 898.779
it doesn't hide things at all you know

895.679 --> 900.13
doesn't do that it always gives the

898.779 --> 903.43
perfect explanation

900.13 --> 906.01
that's not manipulated in any way you

903.43 --> 908.53
don't have to really do your best to get

906.01 --> 910.78
more details to get actual original

908.53 --> 914.5
sources that's not tough at all is it

910.78 --> 917.26
Daniel just google it because Google you

914.5 --> 920.11
know is totally neutral it's not

917.26 --> 935.59
anything biased at all against globe

920.11 --> 937.9300000000001
cosmology you know at all rights because

935.59 --> 939.34
they're not openly in their policy

937.93 --> 942.63
saying they're gonna like censor

939.34 --> 944.95
flat-earthers that's not a sign of

942.63 --> 950.23
taking any sides it's the perfect

944.95 --> 951.88
neutrality right Daniel just google it

950.23 --> 956.52
they'll tell you the honest truth

951.88 --> 956.52
whether the earth is flat or globe right

983.529 --> 986.55
mm eh

1005.0 --> 1007.54
Wow

1016.1 --> 1021.8100000000001
all right

1018.01 --> 1026.3799999999999
no quite frankly III have explained that

1021.81 --> 1028.57
so many times Daniel I have I have

1026.38 --> 1030.5700000000002
addressed gas pressure without a

1028.57 --> 1034.8999999999999
container how gas pressure works our

1030.57 --> 1037.99
logical steps are of these things that's

1034.9 --> 1041.71
just the separate concept and it is

1037.99 --> 1045.07
taught in schools like that so yeah

1041.71 --> 1047.05
that's pretty separate it's basic

1045.07 --> 1048.97
physics really you know there are

1047.05 --> 1053.77
presentations like that that do exactly

1048.97 --> 1056.6200000000001
that on school levels on YouTube so they

1053.77 --> 1059.71
are yeah they're not being flagged for

1056.62 --> 1062.86
in correction or whatever it you know so

1059.71 --> 1064.51
I don't get it I just don't get it why

1062.86 --> 1065.6799999999998
you need why you're saying it's

1064.51 --> 1070.78
incomplete

1065.68 --> 1073.42
I disagree just don't wanna look you're

1070.78 --> 1080.26
being a religious obsessive nutter here

1073.42 --> 1082.3000000000002
with this dude you really are I did

1080.26 --> 1086.74
Randa I did invite him he doesn't want

1082.3 --> 1089.8
to come on because he's afraid probably

1086.74 --> 1094.89
not as good as talking as he is typing

1089.8 --> 1094.8899999999999
and okay that's fine

1117.0 --> 1124.59
yeah that's a fake Nathan Oakley Daniel

1121.17 --> 1138.0700000000002
zero account zero sips

1124.59 --> 1140.4099999999999
it happens yep yeah there's those I

1138.07 --> 1142.72
hadn't looked before what I literally

1140.41 --> 1145.45
unblocked everything so yeah they suck

1142.72 --> 1148.41
had an opportunity to get back and be

1145.45 --> 1148.41
blocked once again

1156.8 --> 1164.52
mmm let's see who's in chat now it's

1160.35 --> 1172.9099999999999
certainly piled up drunken bullet four

1164.52 --> 1172.91
one one Daniel Olivier I know Roger MC

1173.45 --> 1183.6000000000001
sock accounts they all suck and what's

1180.09 --> 1186.5
up with these message retractions why do

1183.6 --> 1186.5
you people do that

1190.56 --> 1201.96
you know what I'm gonna ban everyone

1194.31 --> 1204.72
that does that because the only reason I

1201.96 --> 1206.64
can think of why you would do that is

1204.72 --> 1208.2
because you want something said you want

1206.64 --> 1211.2
it in there and then you don't want to

1208.2 --> 1213.51
be do you want don't want it to be seen

1211.2 --> 1215.94
by me when I actually scour on the chat

1213.51 --> 1220.91
so I'm gonna ban every single one that

1215.94 --> 1223.65
does that from now on unless of course

1220.91 --> 1225.8100000000002
yeah I see that you're typing a message

1223.65 --> 1229.67
right after that because then it will be

1225.81 --> 1232.08
a correction it's just some somebody and

1229.67 --> 1234.69
there's a deleted message you're nothing

1232.08 --> 1238.37
from them after that I'm gonna delete

1234.69 --> 1241.41
you I'm gonna block you just so you know

1238.37 --> 1241.4099999999999
[Music]

1241.58 --> 1246.8
what what's wrong with my volume what

1256.419 --> 1264.499
what oh okay

1261.95 --> 1269.029
my entire audio setting has completely

1264.499 --> 1273.469
changed for some reason what the hell

1269.029 --> 1276.619
happened maybe that's like an app I'll

1273.469 --> 1283.999
try to amp it up a little okay is this

1276.619 --> 1286.4189999999999
what how's this this better how about

1283.999 --> 1286.419
this

1289.63 --> 1292.71
is this louder

1296.08 --> 1302.9499999999998
yeah but is this better or is this too

1298.21 --> 1305.74
loud you tell me but yeah I OBS had an

1302.95 --> 1308.67
update some time ago and apparently the

1305.74 --> 1315.1
entire sound system of it changed

1308.67 --> 1319.69
outside of my notice okay right okay

1315.1 --> 1320.6999999999998
I'll keep it like this I'll check it out

1319.69 --> 1329.95
later

1320.7 --> 1340.38
hey oh oh it's another fake Nathan

1329.95 --> 1344.1100000000001
goodbye yeah you know why I can do that

1340.38 --> 1349.68
because the real Nathan Oakley 1980 has

1344.11 --> 1352.809
a wrench sake suck dumbass

1349.68 --> 1352.809
[Music]

1359.61 --> 1362.7099999999998
[Music]

1365.63 --> 1369.68
hello Nicole Garland

1374.6 --> 1380.3999999999999
are you sure you can't hear any

1376.71 --> 1384.9
difference because the mic auxilary bar

1380.4 --> 1388.17
is definitely show yeah it did kind of

1384.9 --> 1390.18
run still into the green and now it does

1388.17 --> 1392.16
reach into yellow so it can

1390.18 --> 1399.51
it's definitely louder now it should be

1392.16 --> 1403.8000000000002
louder now now Brenda I'm not banning

1399.51 --> 1407.1299999999999
viewers okay I'm banning socks sock

1403.8 --> 1410.0
accounts Brenda are those your sock

1407.13 --> 1415.5200000000002
accounts Brenda are you screwing with me

1410.0 --> 1415.52
again because I know you'd use those

1428.59 --> 1431.519
hmm

1432.88 --> 1438.0100000000002
my voice isn't too much louder you say

1446.309 --> 1452.82
alright okay so my roommate just left so

1450.809 --> 1454.83
I could technically be a lot louder now

1452.82 --> 1462.57
if I wanted to it's not gonna echo

1454.83 --> 1464.809
through don't talk to me like that

1462.57 --> 1464.809
you

1468.01 --> 1474.79
yeah okay the audio is is good I guess

1476.83 --> 1491.1699999999998
it's Sunday I think I would be up for I

1485.08 --> 1494.47
don't know for a Skype caller maybe

1491.17 --> 1494.47
let's see

1500.87 --> 1504.2299999999998
[Music]

1516.63 --> 1523.0300000000002
with this heat a little bit of the

1518.71 --> 1527.56
trouble is that it's not that windy so

1523.03 --> 1533.19
if you're just sitting that's barely

1527.56 --> 1533.19
opened or gets hot

1538.1 --> 1541.1799999999998
[Music]

1547.41 --> 1557.46
yeah so okay yeah right ball busters

1553.35 --> 1559.8899999999999
yesterday and to be fair I was not

1557.46 --> 1564.1100000000001
interested in the slightest it was just

1559.89 --> 1567.24
a bunch of semantics I didn't see it was

1564.11 --> 1568.8899999999999
maybe there was more afterward but every

1567.24 --> 1571.47
time I look it was basic freaking

1568.89 --> 1574.74
semantics and like semantics come on

1571.47 --> 1576.8700000000001
guys I know it's really good to see and

1574.74 --> 1580.2
look into the origin of world of the

1576.87 --> 1583.79
world and that does help but I thought

1580.2 --> 1587.01
it was kind of pointless to me really

1583.79 --> 1589.59
like I tend to rather stack stick to

1587.01 --> 1593.7
look yeah more logical deduction instead

1589.59 --> 1596.01
of word based deduction but I don't know

1593.7 --> 1598.0800000000002
they thought it was a subject fine

1596.01 --> 1601.53
they're gonna do that there is a point

1598.08 --> 1603.71
to it I don't really care too much about

1601.53 --> 1603.71
it

1607.18 --> 1611.24
[Music]

1608.93 --> 1624.6100000000001
but on houses what it was kind of

1611.24 --> 1631.04
interesting yeah I had discussions chemo

1624.61 --> 1632.75
then after that oh yeah I did went up to

1631.04 --> 1633.82
the rest of the ballers I think it got

1632.75 --> 1636.38
pretty loud

1633.82 --> 1639.3799999999999
also because every time spur schema

1636.38 --> 1641.5700000000002
brought up the same [ __ ] again they'd

1639.38 --> 1643.7600000000002
ever get into the discussion what was it

1641.57 --> 1645.4099999999999
about again oh yeah a relative density I

1643.76 --> 1647.45
thought I had a pretty good defense I

1645.41 --> 1650.63
did have to yell it through at times I

1647.45 --> 1653.45
don't know if it all came through but I

1650.63 --> 1657.68
had a lot of energy and I really put

1653.45 --> 1660.17
down the whole thing and as far as I can

1657.68 --> 1662.17
conceptualize it and I yeah I understand

1660.17 --> 1665.1200000000001
that framework I understand it and

1662.17 --> 1667.13
they're weird again

1665.12 --> 1674.1499999999999
semantics and they do this every time

1667.13 --> 1678.0800000000002
it's like oh but you know density was it

1674.15 --> 1680.18
density or displacement yeah this time

1678.08 --> 1682.37
this guy went on this place media but

1680.18 --> 1685.04
displacement is specifically the word

1682.37 --> 1686.9299999999998
they use in the experiment where they

1685.04 --> 1689.93
add something to the water and look at

1686.93 --> 1693.3500000000001
this place like that's really really

1689.93 --> 1696.8300000000002
interesting but that has nothing to do

1693.35 --> 1699.9199999999998
with this and if you're yeah there's

1696.83 --> 1703.51
like types of words that are being used

1699.92 --> 1705.97
in a very specific technical context

1703.51 --> 1708.92
separate from one another

1705.97 --> 1711.29
because there are so many things and

1708.92 --> 1714.5900000000001
just some of the words tend to overlap

1711.29 --> 1717.1399999999999
and it's just a ridiculous argument to

1714.59 --> 1720.23
say that you can't call it displacement

1717.14 --> 1722.39
because there is another experiment that

1720.23 --> 1726.46
also uses the terminology of

1722.39 --> 1726.46
displacement for another concept

1728.99 --> 1736.1
yeah and I don't know I think that they

1733.76 --> 1739.25
see this kind of approach now more and

1736.1 --> 1741.62
more as a fruitful ground to just start

1739.25 --> 1743.99
nitpicking and saying you can't use this

1741.62 --> 1746.059
terminology because it's being used in

1743.99 --> 1748.21
some other specific set up and that

1746.059 --> 1750.44
means that you're using it incorrectly

1748.21 --> 1752.529
man that [ __ ] gets old

1750.44 --> 1752.529
Oh

1756.59 --> 1759.73
[Music]

1765.389 --> 1767.9289999999999
move

1779.69 --> 1795.529
look Daniel okay that's kind of a good

1783.99 --> 1799.289
question the drop rate is basically the

1795.529 --> 1801.059
relative density this equilibrium rate

1799.289 --> 1803.7
the difference between the relative

1801.059 --> 1809.1789999999999
densities of the object and the medium

1803.7 --> 1813.1200000000001
that determines the rate and that also

1809.179 --> 1816.539
technically will start to include air

1813.12 --> 1818.09
friction but yeah the the shape of the

1816.539 --> 1821.549
object or whatever it is it has

1818.09 --> 1823.889
aerodynamic effects as well as well so

1821.549 --> 1828.289
that is also a factor but it's only

1823.889 --> 1831.899
really a factor in the resistance the

1828.289 --> 1834.539
resistance against the acceleration

1831.899 --> 1837.4499999999998
basically and we'll also the create a

1834.539 --> 1844.169
maximum velocity effect but that's

1837.45 --> 1848.279
separate again like so many things that

1844.169 --> 1851.24
yeah there is something right but it's

1848.279 --> 1856.62
not really directly relevant you know

1851.24 --> 1859.049
density scientific proof you have exist

1856.62 --> 1861.149
so many things exist but you know if you

1859.049 --> 1863.69
have a theory about something that does

1861.149 --> 1867.059
not mean that it has to include

1863.69 --> 1869.669
everything in the entire universe

1867.059 --> 1874.769
guys that seems a little bit a little

1869.669 --> 1876.48
bit excessive don't you think right the

1874.769 --> 1880.74
whole point of an experiment is to

1876.48 --> 1887.58
actually keep it simple and physical and

1880.74 --> 1890.13
manipulable so yeah

1887.58 --> 1893.9499999999998
there's things like turbulence there is

1890.13 --> 1896.3700000000001
aerodynamics there is air friction there

1893.95 --> 1900.5800000000002
is the axis of the relative density

1896.37 --> 1902.4699999999998
spectrum and the mystery of why it is

1900.58 --> 1906.27
arranged that way but all these things

1902.47 --> 1910.6000000000001
despite being there have no direct

1906.27 --> 1916.71
relevance to the relative density is

1910.6 --> 1919.4499999999998
experiment that's the issue Oh God

1916.71 --> 1922.83
yeah that's nice really nice than you I

1919.45 --> 1927.63
know there's a gradient I know I know

1922.83 --> 1927.6299999999999
you don't have to tell me

1939.27 --> 1942.779
no it doesn't

1943.92 --> 1947.929
you have no proof of that

1953.63 --> 1959.96
only reason why there's a difference of

1957.05 --> 1963.26
falling rate is obviously due to the gas

1959.96 --> 1967.73
pressure gradient because of the air

1963.26 --> 1970.3
friction is less up there does it make

1967.73 --> 1970.3
any sense

1982.98 --> 1987.32
oh really so what vacuum chamber

1995.4 --> 2000.5500000000002
okay

1997.61 --> 2005.11
now it doesn't falsify the hypothesis at

2000.55 --> 2009.31
all there's nothing to do with it

2005.11 --> 2012.25
a vacuum chamber still has a lower

2009.31 --> 2016.45
density than the object it doesn't

2012.25 --> 2021.22
disprove it look the entire acceleration

2016.45 --> 2023.3500000000001
rate is not even a part of it okay only

2021.22 --> 2026.77
thing that's taken into account is that

2023.35 --> 2031.0
it is deeply displacing and accelerating

2026.77 --> 2034.75
to to maneuverability right I know I

2031.0 --> 2037.62
know you're also bleeding hard desperate

2034.75 --> 2042.43
to fill it all in with your [ __ ] math

2037.62 --> 2046.8899999999999
it's not relevant to the relative

2042.43 --> 2046.89
density Theory get over it

2048.69 --> 2058.03
okay am I please I need all moderators

2053.89 --> 2063.73
to please get active what why is a gem

2058.03 --> 2065.98
the only one yeah Lottie is trolling so

2063.73 --> 2068.34
please ban him instantly every time you

2065.98 --> 2068.34
see name

2092.74 --> 2099.2599999999998
I'm fine with questions I'm just not

2095.779 --> 2115.059
fine with obviously wrong idiotic

2099.26 --> 2117.8900000000003
statements that's all Daniel laughs yeah

2115.059 --> 2121.279
I'll think about it I don't know you for

2117.89 --> 2124.8489999999997
that long but you're yeah you're a

2121.279 --> 2127.51
future candidate sure you are and

2124.849 --> 2127.51
there's others

2140.15 --> 2143.14
no you're not

2155.3 --> 2158.6290000000004
[Music]

2161.69 --> 2165.489
[Music]

2165.93 --> 2177.8199999999997
relative density meters right yeah well

2174.16 --> 2179.98
you know maybe I should emphasize that

2177.82 --> 2183.04
especially after basically getting

2179.98 --> 2186.73
pissed off with math obsession right so

2183.04 --> 2190.35
there's this funny thing I find it extra

2186.73 --> 2193.96
ordinarily hilarious and amusing and

2190.35 --> 2196.92
that is and I I'm pretty certain about

2193.96 --> 2199.9
this talked about it very extensively

2196.92 --> 2203.46
like starting a half year ago people on

2199.9 --> 2207.82
skype and even on the debates background

2203.46 --> 2210.76
and yeah there's a funny thing about the

2207.82 --> 2213.7000000000003
scientific method D the scientific

2210.76 --> 2216.96
method the real one the original one the

2213.7 --> 2222.21
one that actually requires physical

2216.96 --> 2230.89
interaction and that is that it's not

2222.21 --> 2234.58
math based it's purely physical concept

2230.89 --> 2237.04
it is interaction based purely it's not

2234.58 --> 2241.0
math and that's the amazing thing about

2237.04 --> 2244.81
it there is no requirement for math in

2241.0 --> 2248.02
the slightest the only factors that are

2244.81 --> 2253.12
there are interaction non interaction

2248.02 --> 2254.49
change non change there is no numerosity

2253.12 --> 2259.0299999999997
to it

2254.49 --> 2262.0299999999997
it's a ones and zeros it's a yes or a no

2259.03 --> 2265.96
and that's the amazing thing about the

2262.03 --> 2269.8900000000003
scientific method it completely makes it

2265.96 --> 2273.67
possible to exclude math to keep it

2269.89 --> 2277.69
purely real and that's really

2273.67 --> 2282.4300000000003
fascinating to me a binary it's still

2277.69 --> 2285.26
that's still a mathematician of the

2282.43 --> 2288.98
concept but

2285.26 --> 2291.71
because of the yes no do something do

2288.98 --> 2296.5
not something change not change that

2291.71 --> 2299.0
makes math completely irrelevant of

2296.5 --> 2300.95
course you could mathematical eyes

2299.0 --> 2304.369
anything but that

2300.95 --> 2307.3399999999997
there's never math required if somebody

2304.369 --> 2311.21
would not understand math like if they

2307.34 --> 2316.27
were so freakin bad at math that they

2311.21 --> 2319.28
would have trouble like summing up

2316.27 --> 2321.14
two-digit things let's say like they're

2319.28 --> 2325.52
that bad and some people are that bad

2321.14 --> 2328.22
then they could if explained properly

2325.52 --> 2331.25
still applied a scientific method

2328.22 --> 2332.99
because it is just you don't require

2331.25 --> 2337.1
math to use it you just need to

2332.99 --> 2341.2099999999996
understand how it works why it works the

2337.1 --> 2344.7799999999997
way it does and well it is good to study

2341.21 --> 2347.09
up on words and especially technical

2344.78 --> 2348.8
reasoning but that also is not

2347.09 --> 2351.44
necessarily math so there's people that

2348.8 --> 2354.05
are very good with very good at words

2351.44 --> 2356.9
it's like types there are languages all

2354.05 --> 2360.28
over the place but those people can and

2356.9 --> 2365.0
might typically be not so good at math

2360.28 --> 2367.4300000000003
in schools it's funny because they had

2365.0 --> 2369.77
the meaning how it migrated but back

2367.43 --> 2374.48
then I was used to it being called

2369.77 --> 2376.67
alphas and betas how the meanings have

2374.48 --> 2381.26
piled up since then okay but I was a

2376.67 --> 2385.4300000000003
beta at that I I was more interested in

2381.26 --> 2387.4100000000003
math but the thing was patterns it's not

2385.43 --> 2390.5899999999997
really for me about the numbers it's

2387.41 --> 2392.18
about the patterns and that is what got

2390.59 --> 2394.55
me through it because I'm really

2392.18 --> 2396.9199999999996
naturally not that good at math at the

2394.55 --> 2398.84
numerical thing about it I just don't

2396.92 --> 2401.859
really have the talent for it but

2398.84 --> 2405.83
patterns oh yeah and you can definitely

2401.859 --> 2409.0099999999998
translate mathematical principles into

2405.83 --> 2411.68
patterns and if you train it a little

2409.01 --> 2413.2700000000004
yeah if I train it a little I can get a

2411.68 --> 2417.0499999999997
lot better at it and that's how I

2413.27 --> 2418.319
basically got through school by do

2417.05 --> 2421.1400000000003
training that

2418.319 --> 2423.39
and not really being like oh I have to

2421.14 --> 2426.179
study every single line of this freakin

2423.39 --> 2427.979
book for three times I never did that

2426.179 --> 2430.289
[ __ ] I barely even read the books I

2427.979 --> 2432.66
learned more from just asking the right

2430.289 --> 2436.38
questions to the right people teachers

2432.66 --> 2446.699
and students learn so much more from

2436.38 --> 2448.949
that but yeah I study I wasn't all that

2446.699 --> 2451.4990000000003
great at languages I was good at English

2448.949 --> 2454.579
and that's why I yeah two languages in

2451.499 --> 2457.529
school Dutch in English and that was

2454.579 --> 2460.0190000000002
still possible back then I was still in

2457.529 --> 2461.699
a school curriculum time where that was

2460.019 --> 2466.7389999999996
relatively simple after that they

2461.699 --> 2469.259
started like pushing other extra [ __ ] in

2466.739 --> 2470.9
there it makes it made it very complex

2469.259 --> 2474.089
very complicated and tough for

2470.9 --> 2476.1600000000003
generations after me and yeah now it's

2474.089 --> 2482.0389999999998
just I don't know what it is anymore

2476.16 --> 2484.859
I don't know how school works now don't

2482.039 --> 2486.659
know yeah you get rumors of course but I

2484.859 --> 2488.279
don't know how strong it is I don't know

2486.659 --> 2490.0190000000002
how it developed in the meantime haven't

2488.279 --> 2494.089
paid too much attention to the school I

2490.019 --> 2496.919
just remember from when I went to school

2494.089 --> 2500.0389999999998
and things were a little bit more simple

2496.919 --> 2503.549
we had more room to focus properly to

2500.039 --> 2506.9590000000003
really get the subjects if you could if

2503.549 --> 2510.209
you were interested and not just get

2506.959 --> 2511.4089999999997
force-fed huge amount of stuff that you

2510.209 --> 2515.089
don't know what to do with really

2511.409 --> 2517.11
there's no real room in your mind for it

2515.089 --> 2520.249
didn't have that problem

2517.11 --> 2520.2490000000003
[Music]

2526.9 --> 2532.59
yeah yeah that's not a gym let's not

2529.93 --> 2532.5899999999997
talk about that

2541.22 --> 2544.9399999999996
[Music]

2542.41 --> 2548.3799999999997
and I don't think there is anything

2544.94 --> 2550.339
coming you might have saw something I

2548.38 --> 2552.859
think I was right

2550.339 --> 2556.7599999999998
completely about the whole setup because

2552.859 --> 2559.119
if you paid any attention to any kind of

2556.76 --> 2562.3100000000004
relatively mainstream or sub mainstream

2559.119 --> 2564.98
alternative news yeah

2562.31 --> 2566.72
Trump's now suddenly it was really we

2564.98 --> 2570.14
have to do this then he always showed

2566.72 --> 2573.2
mercy by not retaliating against killing

2570.14 --> 2575.0
150 people so they said and now he's

2573.2 --> 2578.23
being like yeah I ran can be our

2575.0 --> 2582.97
greatest ally there it is

2578.23 --> 2586.609
it's negotiation people it's tough

2582.97 --> 2590.2099999999996
negotiation it's crazy for the normal

2586.609 --> 2593.2
person it is you're not strange for

2590.21 --> 2598.7
thinking that that is crazy but that's

2593.2 --> 2602.569
how that [ __ ] is done and well before

2598.7 --> 2605.8689999999997
let's just say twenty years ago the

2602.569 --> 2610.04
media was very much it wasn't they

2605.869 --> 2613.25
weren't that hostile to those in power

2610.04 --> 2615.859
so they would just hide that stuff all

2613.25 --> 2618.47
of it you wouldn't know what they were

2615.859 --> 2622.0989999999997
talking about among one another that

2618.47 --> 2626.1189999999997
wasn't convenient but now that Trump is

2622.099 --> 2627.77
it they're like showing it face in your

2626.119 --> 2633.17
face like yeah this is what they do all

2627.77 --> 2636.819
it saw his look he's crazy but yeah I'm

2633.17 --> 2639.29
pretty sure that this thing typically I

2636.819 --> 2641.27
don't know it's just another approach to

2639.29 --> 2643.7
it it's now more with the media more in

2641.27 --> 2646.46
the open and before this was probably a

2643.7 --> 2650.75
little bit more in secret but there

2646.46 --> 2653.63
would would be threats but I think that

2650.75 --> 2656.45
is just geopolitics really mostly at the

2653.63 --> 2659.4500000000003
time and I don't think there will be a

2656.45 --> 2661.97
war not really there may be some hassle

2659.45 --> 2664.31
it might keep on going but it's it will

2661.97 --> 2666.2
probably end up kind of like the North

2664.31 --> 2668.48
Korea situation where everybody also

2666.2 --> 2670.91
thought oh my god it's gonna be warm

2668.48 --> 2672.17
never hassle armwrestling almost

2670.91 --> 2678.2599999999998
political arm wrestling and then

2672.17 --> 2681.83
friendship friendship again but yeah now

2678.26 --> 2683.9900000000002
that's sort of like me getting bad again

2681.83 --> 2687.23
I don't know it's it's a weird type of

2683.99 --> 2690.0499999999997
theater and it is but it it's not just a

2687.23 --> 2693.94
complete fake out act not like that it

2690.05 --> 2696.8900000000003
has some tie-in it's like a political

2693.94 --> 2700.91
translation it does have some

2696.89 --> 2703.7
significance but it's not like naturally

2700.91 --> 2706.5499999999997
evolving that that's not the case

2703.7 --> 2709.9399999999996
it's always the the attitude and the

2706.55 --> 2712.6000000000004
acts are based on the strategy you gotta

2709.94 --> 2717.17
take into account it's not all natural

2712.6 --> 2720.68
no hmm but I don't think there will be

2717.17 --> 2726.05
like a real serious war like that unless

2720.68 --> 2729.68
Iran just no I don't think they will I

2726.05 --> 2731.6000000000004
just don't think they will listen

2729.68 --> 2733.79
yeah somebody like a really sort of

2731.6 --> 2738.47
false flag the [ __ ] out of the place in

2733.79 --> 2741.2
some way but I I don't think that that

2738.47 --> 2743.1499999999996
even would work I think that it's the

2741.2 --> 2745.45
situation is just too unstable to

2743.15 --> 2748.7200000000003
actually allow this to happen without

2745.45 --> 2753.4399999999996
ruining everything for everyone

2748.72 --> 2760.2799999999997
including their controllers so I think

2753.44 --> 2764.17
that I mean completely forgot to arrange

2760.28 --> 2764.17
my chat properly

2767.55 --> 2771.8700000000003
but yeah I think this is just gonna keep

2770.04 --> 2776.0099999999998
on and it's probably gonna bring in some

2771.87 --> 2779.94
tension more more and more mm-hmm

2776.01 --> 2781.88
heated debates and accusations and like

2779.94 --> 2786.98
what should we do what is common sense

2781.88 --> 2786.98
will be to talk off the day good and

2791.15 --> 2801.98
just be glad that nothing is really

2794.4 --> 2801.98
gonna happen not for a while

2804.68 --> 2812.93
maybe more more stupid terrorist [ __ ] or

2810.29 --> 2816.17
whatever and whatever whether they be

2812.93 --> 2819.29
false flags are real that's probably

2816.17 --> 2822.7400000000002
gonna be the most annoying or yeah

2819.29 --> 2826.67
painful stuff that where that might be

2822.74 --> 2828.9399999999996
somewhat close to real so a chocolate

2826.67 --> 2828.94
scene

2842.31 --> 2847.41
all right so basically how I'm seeing it

2846.72 --> 2851.1299999999997
right now

2847.41 --> 2852.87
and there's no guarantee because hey and

2851.13 --> 2855.42
this is kind of interesting before I

2852.87 --> 2857.91
thought okay I remember things from the

2855.42 --> 2861.6
dark world that I've seen and still have

2857.91 --> 2864.06
to come to pass or pre supposedly so

2861.6 --> 2866.0099999999998
yeah because it's very complex the

2864.06 --> 2869.87
things that I saw then I started to

2866.01 --> 2874.4700000000003
realize wait it seems almost like I've

2869.87 --> 2877.5
seen what-if scenarios in specific

2874.47 --> 2881.0699999999997
moments that do don't actually come to

2877.5 --> 2886.11
pass like that but the opposite and that

2881.07 --> 2889.2000000000003
makes things very weird and then what I

2886.11 --> 2892.38
basically got the results from that what

2889.2 --> 2895.7999999999997
I think might happen is that first is I

2892.38 --> 2899.07
ran raucous but there's no real serious

2895.8 --> 2903.21
action to that but then North Korea

2899.07 --> 2905.88
issue will pop up again and then at some

2903.21 --> 2915.27
point for some serious reason there will

2905.88 --> 2920.46
be like yeah a quick rapid geopolitical

2915.27 --> 2921.66
a shift in some way and that's like

2920.46 --> 2924.96
gonna change everything

2921.66 --> 2927.54
that's gonna like make everything feel

2924.96 --> 2930.0
very differently and attitudes

2927.54 --> 2931.8
differently and but I can't predict what

2930.0 --> 2933.81
that'll be like I just know it's like

2931.8 --> 2942.09
gonna change and everybody will know it

2933.81 --> 2944.82
oh yeah but I don't think like if

2942.09 --> 2949.05
anything starts to like blow up with

2944.82 --> 2950.94
serious well big bombs whether they be

2949.05 --> 2952.86
nukes I've never in my vision actually

2950.94 --> 2958.17
seeing one of these explode

2952.86 --> 2962.88
I saw a simulation of it one time where

2958.17 --> 2965.28
the well the entity that accompanies me

2962.88 --> 2966.09
basically said like yeah this is not

2965.28 --> 2969.4100000000003
gonna happen

2966.09 --> 2969.4100000000003
very clearly

2969.74 --> 2977.37
so I think that if any bombs are gonna

2975.15 --> 2980.2200000000003
explode if any it's probably gonna

2977.37 --> 2983.04
pretty much happen at more the end time

2980.22 --> 2990.33
the final phase and before that it's

2983.04 --> 2992.49
basically gonna be more Bluffs and then

2990.33 --> 3000.65
the Bluffs are no longer working and

2992.49 --> 3003.2299999999996
then just the attitude will shift like I

3000.65 --> 3005.36
don't know I fear that the thing that I

3003.23 --> 3007.46
fear and I can't confirm this I

3005.36 --> 3010.9100000000003
absolutely cannot because it's one of

3007.46 --> 3012.71
the more unclear results of the

3010.91 --> 3016.7
conclusions that I draw from my dark

3012.71 --> 3019.55
world visions but the suggestion was

3016.7 --> 3021.68
that it would literally turn Imperial at

3019.55 --> 3025.94
some point and just start to like almost

3021.68 --> 3027.95
a new form of colonization kind of what

3025.94 --> 3030.11
they're already look that would I do

3027.95 --> 3032.06
like CIA people putting it and then

3030.11 --> 3034.2200000000003
making business deals but it would

3032.06 --> 3036.77
become more aggressive but I don't know

3034.22 --> 3041.62
if this is real so let's just hope it's

3036.77 --> 3041.62
not this is all getting really vague now

3050.37 --> 3057.33
well look there's something interesting

3053.47 --> 3062.9199999999996
about nuclear bombs okay sear

3057.33 --> 3065.89
Sekou years ago look there's lots of

3062.92 --> 3069.64
talk that's not really real that nuclear

3065.89 --> 3073.75
explosion as we've seen it is a trickery

3069.64 --> 3078.1
and yeah indeed it's like a geopolitical

3073.75 --> 3080.2
tool to make sure that lesser parties

3078.1 --> 3083.44
that are not really in the know that's

3080.2 --> 3085.54
what yeah no nuclear presuppose that

3083.44 --> 3089.29
they're not in the know that they would

3085.54 --> 3093.1
be deterred by it or or otherwise to

3089.29 --> 3095.92
basically use the threats to help

3093.1 --> 3097.66
manipulate governments or to help

3095.92 --> 3102.1
governments manipulate their people with

3097.66 --> 3105.97
it so that's one thing but then again if

3102.1 --> 3107.92
that is the case that would naturally be

3105.97 --> 3109.93
known by those that are actually

3107.92 --> 3112.09
upholding it that that couldn't work

3109.93 --> 3114.46
forever even if the people believed it

3112.09 --> 3117.9100000000003
as long as it wouldn't actually you

3114.46 --> 3119.65
needed a deed to prove it and and they

3117.91 --> 3123.04
were able to sort of do that with

3119.65 --> 3125.08
Hiroshima and Iwasaki whatever you

3123.04 --> 3131.59
believe about that it was effectively

3125.08 --> 3133.48
believed it yeah but that's not gonna

3131.59 --> 3137.23
last forever especially in an age of

3133.48 --> 3139.36
mass media so it's very likely that in

3137.23 --> 3141.85
all that time where it is assumed that

3139.36 --> 3144.34
nukes are real and that is supposedly

3141.85 --> 3147.85
developed that at the same time they're

3144.34 --> 3150.2200000000003
they have been developing real freaking

3147.85 --> 3152.8199999999997
big bombs that are maybe very different

3150.22 --> 3157.5699999999997
in nature to the concept of nuclear

3152.82 --> 3160.81
fission supposedly but that will pretty

3157.57 --> 3162.19
much result in the same thing or maybe

3160.81 --> 3167.59
worse I don't know

3162.19 --> 3168.46
so you don't know guys look if they

3167.59 --> 3172.1200000000003
don't have nukes

3168.46 --> 3174.76
they'll have big bombs that they'll

3172.12 --> 3175.21
prefer not to use that are just freakin

3174.76 --> 3177.7900000000004
insane

3175.21 --> 3179.5
so does it really matter if they don't

3177.79 --> 3181.66
have that technical knew yeah it's nice

3179.5 --> 3183.25
that we don't have to think oh my god

3181.66 --> 3187.0899999999997
fallout everything's gonna die

3183.25 --> 3189.31
that's certainly a nice thoughts even if

3187.09 --> 3191.7400000000002
everything went wrong but yeah you can

3189.31 --> 3193.96
demo bet that a lot of things could be

3191.74 --> 3197.9199999999996
just completely destroyed that can

3193.96 --> 3200.92
definitely happen so don't don't take

3197.92 --> 3205.27
this oh but nukes probably not real as

3200.92 --> 3206.56
some kind of excuse Oh fine nothing

3205.27 --> 3208.8
could happen what could go wrong with

3206.56 --> 3211.21
like the Luo think it ever happen is oh

3208.8 --> 3213.82
wait yeah they can't actually blow

3211.21 --> 3215.98
everything up maybe not very quickly

3213.82 --> 3221.4700000000003
very easily very dramatically but yeah

3215.98 --> 3223.619
they can so does it really matter you

3221.47 --> 3223.6189999999997
know

3234.759 --> 3240.7690000000002
yeah yeah Brenda nukes are so real

3238.13 --> 3247.42
you actually saw one with your own eyes

3240.769 --> 3247.4199999999996
right or did you see it on the Tali

3253.239 --> 3258.529
chocolate Satan I don't know if you're a

3255.499 --> 3261.3489999999997
form but Lottie has a permanent band so

3258.529 --> 3265.869
please use your wrench to ban him the

3261.349 --> 3265.869
second you see him thank you very much

3267.91 --> 3277.249
Nathan that's not the real Nathan the

3271.549 --> 3284.2889999999998
real Nathan has a wrench I think right

3277.249 --> 3284.2889999999998
oh let me check

3289.849 --> 3297.1090000000004
Oh oops nope that was too real faith and

3294.67 --> 3297.799
so he didn't have a wrench okay that's

3297.109 --> 3301.4
interesting

3297.799 --> 3308.839
sorry about that Nathan now uh and do

3301.4 --> 3313.369
that where are you yeah chocolates

3308.839 --> 3316.279
saying yeah I had to ban like three or

3313.369 --> 3320.359
two or three Nathan Oakley socks before

3316.279 --> 3324.67
so I thought it was him again I was kind

3320.359 --> 3324.67
of too quick hi Nathan sorry for that I

3325.63 --> 3332.089
guess he didn't have a ranch after all

3329.66 --> 3335.0789999999997
oh yeah I took it away because he kind

3332.089 --> 3335.0789999999997
of abused it earlier

3343.04 --> 3359.74
now how is a I'm not a troll they want

3347.45 --> 3359.74
me to whack you hey my house key

3393.25 --> 3401.359
tybo's hey if any of you want to come on

3399.2 --> 3403.49
my panel through Skype please let me

3401.359 --> 3407.8089999999997
know and I'll add you because if they're

3403.49 --> 3412.8999999999996
rambling on for an hour now and yeah I

3407.809 --> 3416.599
could basically I hope the stream and

3412.9 --> 3421.13
continue tomorrow but I wouldn't mind

3416.599 --> 3425.21
having a good conversation Lisa would

3421.13 --> 3428.2000000000003
you like to come on I take people on

3425.21 --> 3428.2
skype these days

3433.27 --> 3444.36
if Nathan wants to come one that's cool

3435.46 --> 3444.36
too hmm seems he only just said hello

3469.75 --> 3475.48
okay cool you so that sounds nice you

3473.23 --> 3482.83
know what it's so hot I think I kind of

3475.48 --> 3484.93
deserve a break as well damn this door

3482.83 --> 3490.5699999999997
also keeps on closing every time she'll

3484.93 --> 3492.1299999999997
be annoying I need the fresh air but

3490.57 --> 3494.6400000000003
yeah we'll be cool to have kind of a

3492.13 --> 3494.6400000000003
panel day

3499.58 --> 3504.3199999999997
maybe what could have a discussion about

3501.65 --> 3507.83
oh hey thanks for the super saturation

3504.32 --> 3509.78
Nathan see seventy-nine cents pound

3507.83 --> 3511.61
pounds or pence is it right

3509.78 --> 3515.48
yeah seventy nine pence oh thanks for

3511.61 --> 3517.9300000000003
that sorry for the mistake in banner

3515.48 --> 3517.93
earlier

3533.03 --> 3540.4100000000003
you know what this whole set up for my

3535.91 --> 3543.92
show is it kind of works what's a little

3540.41 --> 3547.3999999999996
messy because what I'm basically doing

3543.92 --> 3550.1
is actually spending a lot of time and

3547.4 --> 3551.63
energy interacting with chat and it has

3550.1 --> 3553.93
some advantages and it has some

3551.63 --> 3557.36
disadvantages because the advantage is

3553.93 --> 3562.6699999999996
well thanks to having pretty interesting

3557.36 --> 3564.92
public that follow my show and basically

3562.67 --> 3567.02
also I have to admit kind of like

3564.92 --> 3569.6
conditioning you guys with how I deal

3567.02 --> 3571.67
with things to basically prevent you

3569.6 --> 3575.96
from misbehaving and getting all

3571.67 --> 3579.53
[ __ ] and yeah basically encouraging

3575.96 --> 3582.11
you to bring forth good questions that

3579.53 --> 3584.0
way I will always have something to talk

3582.11 --> 3586.88
about even when I run out of subject

3584.0 --> 3589.49
which yeah it does happen like every

3586.88 --> 3591.11
time because there's a if you have to

3589.49 --> 3592.7299999999996
talk every day there's only so much you

3591.11 --> 3596.0
can talk about before you kind of run

3592.73 --> 3598.19
out and if you're lucky you might get

3596.0 --> 3599.96
really inspired enough to fill up a

3598.19 --> 3601.34
whole show or more and that happens

3599.96 --> 3604.04
sometimes it's not always a guarantee

3601.34 --> 3607.4300000000003
the downside however of being that

3604.04 --> 3610.22
interactive with chat oh yeah that's

3607.43 --> 3613.2799999999997
right thanks Nathan but the downside is

3610.22 --> 3615.3799999999997
that yeah the trolls have a little bit

3613.28 --> 3620.2400000000002
more grip and indeed if I'm then gonna

3615.38 --> 3622.57
be yeah being more confronted with

3620.24 --> 3625.3999999999996
trolls being annoying than with people

3622.57 --> 3627.3500000000004
asking me good questions then they will

3625.4 --> 3629.87
get the attention unfortunately that's

3627.35 --> 3633.2
the downside of it the only way to evade

3629.87 --> 3636.71
it is to somehow I don't know have

3633.2 --> 3639.08
people that can help me out it would be

3636.71 --> 3646.07
more a team effort to get out of that

3639.08 --> 3648.14
and help me or maybe I don't know maybe

3646.07 --> 3650.42
I could do it and but then I'd have to

3648.14 --> 3653.18
like really discipline myself in a way

3650.42 --> 3656.66
that I really put a program for everyday

3653.18 --> 3658.7599999999998
together like a list of subjects forced

3656.66 --> 3660.5299999999997
and I don't know if I can really do that

3658.76 --> 3662.36
I think that would go wrong I think I

3660.53 --> 3666.5600000000004
really like the improvisation way

3662.36 --> 3668.7200000000003
because my naturally arriving ideas

3666.56 --> 3670.82
I personally think are the most valuable

3668.72 --> 3672.08
that's how I certainly figure out new

3670.82 --> 3675.32
things and if I'm gonna basically

3672.08 --> 3677.9
railroad a format that kind of ability

3675.32 --> 3679.79
tends to go away so that's why I've been

3677.9 --> 3684.23
very hesitant to become a more

3679.79 --> 3687.38
programming type of show well thanks for

3684.23 --> 3689.3
the superjet donation again Nathan says

3687.38 --> 3691.46
our windows ace that's cool yeah you're

3689.3 --> 3693.4100000000003
you're good guy too I hope you

3691.46 --> 3697.43
appreciated my defense of you yesterday

3693.41 --> 3700.46
and joses it's really tough one though

3697.43 --> 3702.62
because you yeah you have you you have a

3700.46 --> 3705.11
little devil in you as well and you know

3702.62 --> 3709.7599999999998
it so it's really very hard to describe

3705.11 --> 3715.34
at all I don't know correctly you're not

3709.76 --> 3717.2900000000004
so you're not the simple guy anyway yeah

3715.34 --> 3720.6200000000003
I do kind of like my interaction with

3717.29 --> 3723.2799999999997
Chad and I just hope to collect more

3720.62 --> 3725.7799999999997
awesome people that I can interact with

3723.28 --> 3729.25
that'll make it easier eventually to

3725.78 --> 3732.6800000000003
have more reliable moderators and then

3729.25 --> 3734.57
yeah that they'll completely take care

3732.68 --> 3739.1299999999997
of the troll so they won't distract me

3734.57 --> 3750.4100000000003
then again oh who let you one oh yeah I

3739.13 --> 3752.21
don't have you been anyway don't time

3750.41 --> 3756.0499999999997
that out that's so hilarious

3752.21 --> 3760.64
I want that to be there

3756.05 --> 3760.6400000000003
[Laughter]

3771.09 --> 3783.79
now now that's too hilarious nothing No

3775.96 --> 3788.05
Oh Nathan you're hearing that okay I'll

3783.79 --> 3789.64
I'll offer my platform if Sean Hawkins

3788.05 --> 3791.92
and Nathan Oakley could have a

3789.64 --> 3794.02
one-on-one debate on my channel I'll

3791.92 --> 3797.6800000000003
host it you'll have to call in on skype

3794.02 --> 3800.02
and if things get out of hand then you

3797.68 --> 3802.0
end either stop I will just drop the

3800.02 --> 3805.84
Skype call so are you up for that

3802.0 --> 3808.74
oh oh yeah Issa you would get on yep

3805.84 --> 3808.7400000000002
I'll call you in II

3809.51 --> 3813.2090000000003
[Music]

3815.88 --> 3821.86
yeah it's good brother hey you hear me

3819.43 --> 3823.72
yeah I can hear you all right yeah man

3821.86 --> 3827.34
that's how you do a brother who your

3823.72 --> 3831.72
volume is loud yeah I'm doing great

3827.34 --> 3834.9100000000003
cool man good bit hot bit it's very odd

3831.72 --> 3837.6699999999996
night on not as not as hot a topic as

3834.91 --> 3840.8799999999997
600 nautical miles being navigated as

3837.67 --> 3843.4500000000003
flat I wonder why no one's picked up on

3840.88 --> 3850.63
that a little stronger but our dose

3843.45 --> 3852.85
square miles or mouth I was just joking

3850.63 --> 3854.53
oh yeah I don't know somebody was

3852.85 --> 3859.2999999999997
confused with that issue I mean the ball

3854.53 --> 3861.4
yeah we know we know it was like well I

3859.3 --> 3864.52
got a I got a clarify just cause like

3861.4 --> 3867.28
people think reason like okay let me

3864.52 --> 3870.79
clarify a tricyclic we go plane

3867.28 --> 3873.9100000000003
surveying treats 300 square miles as

3870.79 --> 3876.85
flat which is like 17 miles by 17 miles

3873.91 --> 3879.1
and so you know that's one thing and

3876.85 --> 3881.23
then you have another alternative of the

3879.1 --> 3884.17
different thing is that in plain sailing

3881.23 --> 3886.69
navigation they navigate 600 nautical

3884.17 --> 3889.33
miles as flat in one direction and

3886.69 --> 3891.34
shoutout to Rufus out there who made a

3889.33 --> 3895.0
video in response to that ruthless

3891.34 --> 3897.8
showed I mean really am i right oh yeah

3895.0 --> 3900.24
rule if I caught roofie

3897.8 --> 3907.53
rufus sounds like a crossover routine

3900.24 --> 3908.37
rule rule if like but everybody's always

3907.53 --> 3913.11
go to sleep

3908.37 --> 3914.6099999999997
oh god yeah he made a response video so

3913.11 --> 3917.6400000000003
shout out to him for at least Kipnis

3914.61 --> 3920.1
[ __ ] and everyone out there it's 600

3917.64 --> 3924.39
nautical miles in one direction they

3920.1 --> 3926.58
navigate it as flat that's a fact and I

3924.39 --> 3930.18
just love that and I hope everyone just

3926.58 --> 3932.25
talks about that for some reason but hey

3930.18 --> 3934.1699999999996
I don't really care anymore cuz you know

3932.25 --> 3936.21
why I think they not that we have our

3934.17 --> 3939.96
whole monetary system based on

3936.21 --> 3942.12
monetizing space so if Flat Earth wins

3939.96 --> 3943.7400000000002
they're gonna be screwed as far as a

3942.12 --> 3946.29
debt thing and then they're gonna have

3943.74 --> 3950.43
to go to war the dead cream money

3946.29 --> 3952.56
oh you mean the United States yeah well

3950.43 --> 3955.89
I think really touched anything attached

3952.56 --> 3958.11
to the IMF so my opinion is that they

3955.89 --> 3959.73
can't let flatters win like as much as

3958.11 --> 3962.42
actually guys I love that dude

3959.73 --> 3965.01
conspiracy cats that dude is hilarious

3962.42 --> 3966.33
but he's trying to rip apart all the

3965.01 --> 3968.4
flake all these guys are trying to rip

3966.33 --> 3972.48
apart Flat Earth I think it the Heston

3968.4 --> 3974.4900000000002
whatever [ __ ] thing because if it

3972.48 --> 3977.3
flatters if flat earth takes over that

3974.49 --> 3980.7299999999996
takes away their ability to monetize

3977.3 --> 3982.32
asteroids which which allows for the

3980.73 --> 3984.93
expenditures and the printing of money

3982.32 --> 3987.1200000000003
and week you know Flat Earth just can't

3984.93 --> 3995.31
win in that regard that's why I pending

3987.12 --> 3998.04
I don't I see the well I think that it's

3995.31 --> 4000.56
certainly not gonna help look the whole

3998.04 --> 4003.41
thing is is there's America has giant

4000.56 --> 4006.29
debt and they're basically technically

4003.41 --> 4007.19
kind of like bluffing like yeah we we

4006.29 --> 4009.95
can handle it

4007.19 --> 4012.4
but if then it is kind of like

4009.95 --> 4015.62
officially proven that oh my god their

4012.4 --> 4018.53
primary unique super thing that they did

4015.62 --> 4021.08
that made them so great supposedly that

4018.53 --> 4023.48
was fake then that Bluff would kind of

4021.08 --> 4025.73
like fade away and you don't know what's

4023.48 --> 4028.16
gonna resolve like somebody would may be

4025.73 --> 4030.16
able to come after them or like the

4028.16 --> 4031.6299999999997
bankers might bill that

4030.16 --> 4034.45
could happen but that doesn't

4031.63 --> 4036.069
necessarily mean that it will take this

4034.45 --> 4037.779
out what's cool is like you know like

4036.069 --> 4040.089
Donald Trump is over here talking about

4037.779 --> 4042.4
they they perpetrated a hoax in this

4040.089 --> 4044.2889999999998
Russia collusion thing mm-hmm but what

4042.4 --> 4046.089
if what if he goes all the way back to

4044.289 --> 4048.25
the moon landing and shows that all that

4046.089 --> 4049.72
was a hoax to and that we were duped by

4048.25 --> 4052.18
a certain section that was in our

4049.72 --> 4054.8489999999997
government mm-hmm all right route them

4052.18 --> 4056.89
out and we do a better freaking life for

4054.849 --> 4059.71
everybody yeah that is definitely a

4056.89 --> 4063.22
possibility if it'll is allowed to get

4059.71 --> 4070.48
to that point well and that may be the

4063.22 --> 4072.609
trick there's no way to get out of the

4070.48 --> 4073.42
government script of things you know

4072.609 --> 4075.7
anything like they've got everything

4073.42 --> 4079.779
planned added edit out everyone's audio

4075.7 --> 4081.8799999999997
hoax and everything but like but what if

4079.779 --> 4085.119
there's like you know as a pro Spiritist

4081.88 --> 4086.98
I think that there is some good in our

4085.119 --> 4088.48
system that's gonna help us in some way

4086.98 --> 4090.339
I got with hope

4088.48 --> 4093.19
you know and part of that maybe this

4090.339 --> 4096.009
whole Donald Trump come in rip up the

4093.19 --> 4097.779
whole lie including the NASA moon

4096.009 --> 4100.33
landing I mean you know did you hear

4097.779 --> 4102.819
about NASA like they like dropped a note

4100.33 --> 4105.79
to Donald Trump like two miles away from

4102.819 --> 4108.279
where he was staying at RIKEN I mean

4105.79 --> 4109.719
Luke yeah look it up right now please if

4108.279 --> 4109.96
you're on a computer look it up right

4109.719 --> 4113.679
now

4109.96 --> 4116.02
NASA dropped like some kind of a note to

4113.679 --> 4118.4490000000005
Donald Trump two miles away from where

4116.02 --> 4121.389
he was staying and nobody knows how the

4118.449 --> 4122.678999999999
note got there and they think it's like

4121.389 --> 4124.06
you know like somebody dropped it at the

4122.679 --> 4126.1900000000005
ISS or something you know it's not that

4124.06 --> 4128.859
ridiculous but it but it kind of like it

4126.19 --> 4130.62
it alludes to that look if you don't

4128.859 --> 4133.6900000000005
mind look it up brother

4130.62 --> 4133.96
what alludes to what sorry I don't get

4133.69 --> 4136.3589999999995
it

4133.96 --> 4137.799
well no no no say I'm like well it

4136.359 --> 4140.429
alludes to like the idea that somebody

4137.799 --> 4143.85
reached out the ISS and drop this thing

4140.429 --> 4146.529
what's the relation ridiculous folk tale

4143.85 --> 4148.839
it's really good but they really did

4146.529 --> 4152.679
drop a note two miles away from where he

4148.839 --> 4154.839
was staying down in New Jersey okay look

4152.679 --> 4156.759
that check that herb look that up man if

4154.839 --> 4160.929
you can I will I'll look it up if you

4156.759 --> 4163.69
can okay yeah try it it seems like kind

4160.929 --> 4166.0
of ridiculous subject

4163.69 --> 4168.28
it sounds very similar in the tone of

4166.0 --> 4172.71
that the passport they found it next to

4168.28 --> 4172.71
the World Trade Center you know that no

4173.7 --> 4177.5199999999995
is that why was not asked for taking

4176.86 --> 4180.009999999999
this yeah

4177.52 --> 4182.05
the independent NASA package drops out

4180.01 --> 4187.900000000001
of the sky with bizarre message about

4182.05 --> 4189.9400000000005
Donald Trump August 10th 2018 okay get

4187.9 --> 4192.219999999999
up why would NASA why would NASA take

4189.94 --> 4193.66
interest in that maybe and I it just

4192.22 --> 4196.21
makes me think it's just a food for

4193.66 --> 4199.12
thought kind of thing on this beautiful

4196.21 --> 4201.64
day is what if Trump is gonna take out

4199.12 --> 4205.03
NASA at NASA as part of the whole the

4201.64 --> 4206.5
VIX iam sex call you know dude did you

4205.03 --> 4210.58
hear about that to the victims in

4206.5 --> 4212.95
Hollywood fixing sounds call this check

4210.58 --> 4215.14
it out the call any games that's cool

4212.95 --> 4218.05
listen man I'm just course but it's a

4215.14 --> 4220.54
Yale Renier was just found guilty on all

4218.05 --> 4224.2
charges which proves that there was a

4220.54 --> 4226.18
Hollywood [ __ ] cult with eleven child

4224.2 --> 4228.97
daycare centers around the world

4226.18 --> 4230.860000000001
mmm-hmm and my point is that if these

4228.97 --> 4232.96
dudes are getting wrapped up and kicked

4230.86 --> 4235.12
out then what if NASA is a part of that

4232.96 --> 4243.64
and what if that's why you know things

4235.12 --> 4245.53
are interesting i I I think it's a it

4243.64 --> 4251.650000000001
might be a little bit far-fetched it

4245.53 --> 4254.05
look but hormones and did not say is

4251.65 --> 4257.29
basically acting just like an a

4254.05 --> 4260.71
government acting agency that's what

4257.29 --> 4265.3
they're doing so I don't see why they

4260.71 --> 4267.34
would be taken out like that like you

4265.3 --> 4269.68
think they would be all be taken down

4267.34 --> 4272.56
afterwards so there would be nobody

4269.68 --> 4277.87
there left to say that actually was

4272.56 --> 4280.4800000000005
faked no that's why there's bro that is

4277.87 --> 4282.28
base force and what space for Aziz spray

4280.48 --> 4285.759999999999
space force there's another wing of the

4282.28 --> 4288.16
military that probably is going to is

4285.76 --> 4289.99
probably gonna push out NASA because

4288.16 --> 4291.7
NASA can't even find the telemetry data

4289.99 --> 4294.61
that they used it I mean how reliable

4291.7 --> 4296.05
are these being right right how

4294.61 --> 4297.49
efficient do you think Donald Trump's

4296.05 --> 4299.38
gonna put up with that kind of interface

4297.49 --> 4302.53
see you go to the [ __ ] moon and lose

4299.38 --> 4304.57
the telemetry data what I think Donald

4302.53 --> 4308.139999999999
Trump handles that [ __ ] well but that's

4304.57 --> 4310.33
really bizarre because well that's right

4308.14 --> 4312.51
but that but then it's gonna be even

4310.33 --> 4315.43
worse it's gonna be

4312.51 --> 4317.110000000001
instead of ya government basically being

4315.43 --> 4319.81
sort of in the know about it

4317.11 --> 4321.73
being faked it's like literally a

4319.81 --> 4324.1900000000005
government within the government faking

4321.73 --> 4330.16
the government right that's really

4324.19 --> 4335.74
freaky hey-oh welcome to the show okay I

4330.16 --> 4338.0199999999995
have no idea I don't really yeah I don't

4335.74 --> 4340.179999999999
really know about space force too much

4338.02 --> 4342.7300000000005
what that even is what they're gonna do

4340.18 --> 4346.54
if it matters if they're just there to

4342.73 --> 4353.23
put up a good show and then it yes a

4346.54 --> 4354.91
nice fake or but whatever what do you

4353.23 --> 4357.009999999999
think about that yeah let's see let's

4354.91 --> 4358.66
see the earth really is flat it really

4357.01 --> 4360.85
is you know it's flat in proportion to

4358.66 --> 4362.44
the hold right with no detection of

4360.85 --> 4364.06
curvature by the way sorry answers are

4362.44 --> 4366.009999999999
all done by the way thank you fled

shout out to flat accord music man yo so

4381.01 --> 4384.1900000000005
what about this idea that like you know

4382.48 --> 4385.75
how could you like let's see the eros is

4384.19 --> 4387.73
like you know or not you know it's a

4385.75 --> 4389.32
it's it's a flat it's like whatever you

4387.73 --> 4391.48
want to say it is something other than

4389.32 --> 4394.03
what we've been told now what a better

4391.48 --> 4397.2699999999995
way like how could you deprive someone

4394.03 --> 4399.58
the enlightening experience of waking up

4397.27 --> 4402.13
from that by destroying the illusion

4399.58 --> 4404.86
that you would wake up from that's a

4402.13 --> 4407.29
disservice to any conscious any thinking

4404.86 --> 4410.0199999999995
person right because I mean you're

4407.29 --> 4412.75
you're denying them the right for for

4410.02 --> 4416.200000000001
them to find their own way out of a

4412.75 --> 4418.48
false paradigm mm-hmm and that if you

4416.2 --> 4420.04
like and look rejoice you want to look

4418.48 --> 4422.589999999999
right and what kind of world would you

4420.04 --> 4424.0
want to live in where people just you

4422.59 --> 4425.95
know like yeah I mean where you're

4424.0 --> 4428.56
forced to believe the truth you mean

4425.95 --> 4430.3099999999995
right yeah and like you know and you can

4428.56 --> 4432.2300000000005
yeah you have a good point there

4430.31 --> 4434.14
you know and this is like the Battle of

4432.23 --> 4436.879999999999
freewill versus like you know

4434.14 --> 4438.71
totalitarianism and like you know and

4436.88 --> 4441.26
what's beauty is that is beautiful to

4438.71 --> 4443.3
man way is that in this world where the

4441.26 --> 4444.83
general population looks at the world as

4443.3 --> 4446.66
a ball and spinning through space and

4444.83 --> 4448.16
takes all you know and there's a there's

4446.66 --> 4450.32
interesting information that could lead

4448.16 --> 4451.67
one to believe that [ __ ] but there's

4450.32 --> 4453.2
also interesting information that could

4451.67 --> 4456.2300000000005
lead to other where you know otherwise

4453.2 --> 4459.2
and I and I just think that to deprive

4456.23 --> 4460.7
anyone of their own opinion about it and

4459.2 --> 4463.04
that's what that's why I fight you know

4460.7 --> 4465.23
I like Flat Earth is because it fights

4463.04 --> 4467.69
for the opinion of the underdog in this

4465.23 --> 4470.24
society not many people think the earth

4467.69 --> 4472.91
is flat so to step up and say so is to

4470.24 --> 4478.099999999999
step up for you know the this underdog

4472.91 --> 4480.11
of a valuable idea you know but to

4478.1 --> 4482.33
deprive anyone else if they're right to

4480.11 --> 4484.82
think that or to deprive let's say the

4482.33 --> 4487.3099999999995
coming generations the ability to wake

4484.82 --> 4490.34
up from an illusion and you know like I

4487.31 --> 4491.900000000001
mean think of the beauty that entails

4490.34 --> 4493.04
want you know when you start thinking to

4491.9 --> 4495.11
yourself wait a minute maybe the earth

4493.04 --> 4498.82
isn't a ball I mean that's a it's

4495.11 --> 4502.13
terrifying but it's also liberating

4498.82 --> 4504.2
terrifying why well I think it's

4502.13 --> 4505.7
terrifying for people that aren't hip to

4504.2 --> 4507.44
certain [ __ ] because I'm its tell ya

4505.7 --> 4509.72
it's terrifying man like because let's

4507.44 --> 4510.95
see it's terrifying to think that you

4509.72 --> 4513.35
would have been lied to by these

4510.95 --> 4516.23
institutions that's that's what actually

4513.35 --> 4518.42
but is that actually what happens what

4516.23 --> 4520.04
why they well I don't think that we're

4518.42 --> 4522.02
lied to by the institution's either

4520.04 --> 4524.33
because usually the institutions never

4522.02 --> 4527.42
hold a no you're missing a step it seems

4524.33 --> 4530.33
you're like like they'd have instant

4527.42 --> 4533.84
cognate cognitive response I don't think

4530.33 --> 4535.37
that's the case I think people that that

4533.84 --> 4538.81
are confronted that it might not be a

4535.37 --> 4543.74
globe are usually just more shocked and

4538.81 --> 4545.780000000001
have a panic deflection response I don't

4543.74 --> 4548.33
think it's that cognitive at all I think

4545.78 --> 4550.3099999999995
that might come come afterward well

4548.33 --> 4551.18
hence the term terrifying that's what

4550.31 --> 4553.1
I'm trying to say is that I think

4551.18 --> 4554.81
initially it's terrifying for some

4553.1 --> 4557.42
people and what I'm thinking that

4554.81 --> 4559.160000000001
cognitive really their response well I'm

4557.42 --> 4561.08
yeah but I wouldn't put too much weight

4559.16 --> 4564.75
on the term terrifying in that sense but

4561.08 --> 4567.389
I appreciate your here linguistic since

4564.75 --> 4568.98
but I think I do think that like you

4567.389 --> 4571.4400000000005
know it is terrifying for some people

4568.98 --> 4573.329
but it's also liberating you know and I

4571.44 --> 4575.61
mean and it's and it's something that I

4573.329 --> 4577.558999999999
think is good for society you know

4575.61 --> 4579.719
regardless of because we can't verify

4577.559 --> 4582.0
any of this information outside of

4579.719 --> 4583.699
having a third party like I heard

4582.0 --> 4586.29
somebody's doing like a

4583.699 --> 4587.94
Aristophanes test with like two thousand

4586.29 --> 4591.3
people and I was like you know what are

4587.94 --> 4593.219
you guys using solar filters No

4591.3 --> 4594.9890000000005
then shut the [ __ ] up and Aristophanes

4593.219 --> 4599.21
didn't even use a [ __ ] solar filter

4594.989 --> 4602.5199999999995
well didn't the flat earthers did a Sun

4599.21 --> 4605.369
test remember so isn't that technically

4602.52 --> 4607.679
the same data gathering type just

4605.369 --> 4609.598999999999
without the freaking ball fry agree

4607.679 --> 4611.4
because you can't it's the same thing

4609.599 --> 4613.77
you just don't freakin presuppose the

4611.4 --> 4616.71
ball you just take the data for the data

4613.77 --> 4619.530000000001
and then you might presuppose it's a

4616.71 --> 4623.07
ball of light going over the earth is as

4619.53 --> 4624.69
disk but that's to each their eyes and

4623.07 --> 4626.5199999999995
that's the thing and that's it's still a

4624.69 --> 4629.28
presupposition but I mean hey all of

4626.52 --> 4631.679
these scientific experiments or you know

4629.28 --> 4633.809
experiments or observations you know

4631.679 --> 4636.0
they're just you know how good is it for

4633.809 --> 4637.829000000001
humanity to go through these things to

4636.0 --> 4639.809
look at the Sun differently to look at

4637.829 --> 4642.0
the moon differently but people take all

4639.809 --> 4643.349
these things for granted and how cool is

4642.0 --> 4644.55
it that flatters kind of wakes everyone

4643.349 --> 4646.2300000000005
up and says hey maybe you look at the

4644.55 --> 4649.679
moon again go look at uh what do you

4646.23 --> 4652.0199999999995
call it uh a cell and Helion and tell me

4649.679 --> 4653.159
how that works on a spinning ball and

4652.02 --> 4655.139
all the rest of it and try to tell me

4653.159 --> 4657.48
how well it's the light refracting off

4655.139 --> 4660.059
the earth and dude oh god you know like

4657.48 --> 4664.079
it's beautiful man it's just it's it's a

4660.059 --> 4666.54
it's can you handle the disarray and I

4664.079 --> 4670.44
always like to say where's the moon

4666.54 --> 4673.849
every month for three days why don't we

4670.44 --> 4676.619
see a shadow and a very blatant shadow

4673.849 --> 4678.9890000000005
is supposedly right in front of the Sun

4676.619 --> 4681.989
but we only see that shadow when it's

4678.989 --> 4684.36
exactly in front of the Sun you know

4681.989 --> 4687.598999999999
where's the work why can we then even

4684.36 --> 4689.13
see the shadow on the moon at all when

4687.599 --> 4691.92
it's not that close to the Sun that

4689.13 --> 4694.1990000000005
doesn't make technical sense it should

4691.92 --> 4695.659
be like a black dots for those three

4694.199 --> 4697.638999999999
days

4695.659 --> 4699.62
right right but yeah but you couldn't

4697.639 --> 4703.76
see it the idea is it's gone see it's

4699.62 --> 4705.98
nothing but yes I mean I that's fair

4703.76 --> 4709.55
point in the night you can actually see

4705.98 --> 4711.709999999999
the shadow side of the moon did you but

4709.55 --> 4716.570000000001
right during the day you can't makes

4711.71 --> 4719.0
perfect sense well I guess it would just

4716.57 --> 4721.009999999999
be out of alignment with your ability

4719.0 --> 4723.62
because what I found with a lot of the

4721.01 --> 4726.59
ballers stuff is that if you really pay

4723.62 --> 4728.21
attention to it it could make sense like

4726.59 --> 4730.76
you know it has the potential to make

4728.21 --> 4732.56
sense and you know and for that you have

4730.76 --> 4736.58
to give it I guess I'd you know but it's

4732.56 --> 4739.4890000000005
a geometrical framework it accounts for

4736.58 --> 4742.219
a geometrical aspects that's it that's

4739.489 --> 4745.669999999999
the only thing it accounts for doesn't

4742.219 --> 4747.7390000000005
account for any physics or anything but

4745.67 --> 4749.2390000000005
it is it is it's a and everything else

4747.739 --> 4751.459999999999
yeah I mean it's a fascinating

4749.239 --> 4753.23
discussion man I just stopped I'm I'm

4751.46 --> 4755.9
happy that you know it's still it's

4753.23 --> 4759.349999999999
still going on it's still crazy it's

4755.9 --> 4761.03
still fun you know to me I think you

4759.35 --> 4762.820000000001
know you're not having fun Flattr with

4761.03 --> 4766.159
him you're doing it wrong

4762.82 --> 4770.239
you know what I mean it's like it's too

4766.159 --> 4772.3099999999995
fun I think I don't know I have ups and

4770.239 --> 4775.25
downs with it sometimes I'm kind of

4772.31 --> 4778.21
amused by baller devious things and all

4775.25 --> 4781.94
the times I'm just really sick of it

4778.21 --> 4785.03
and well depends on my mood but yeah

4781.94 --> 4790.219
it's I'm pretty solid in what I do I'm

4785.03 --> 4794.0599999999995
very confident about my ability in this

4790.219 --> 4795.92
whole thing and yeah there's really no

4794.06 --> 4797.75
problem even if I'm in a bad mood the

4795.92 --> 4799.7300000000005
only problem is is that I might just

4797.75 --> 4804.409
make myself look more like a dick that's

4799.73 --> 4807.08
all try to say try to tone that down as

4804.409 --> 4809.599999999999
much as I can because hey if I get like

4807.08 --> 4812.12
that I have to like express it if I make

4809.6 --> 4815.63
swallow it then I'll get sick of it you

4812.12 --> 4818.599999999999
know I can't swallow that type of

4815.63 --> 4819.53
frustration once you know that's what

4818.6 --> 4821.42
like I'm nice

4819.53 --> 4823.009999999999
whatever I came out here and I remember

4821.42 --> 4824.87
we used to just be in the open hangouts

4823.01 --> 4827.33
and people would just openly flip out on

4824.87 --> 4829.19
you in the hangout and I just don't

4827.33 --> 4831.32
think to myself like man you need

4829.19 --> 4833.599999999999
to go for a jog you know I mean because

4831.32 --> 4836.179999999999
you got to remember it's mind body and

4833.6 --> 4839.2390000000005
spirit so it's like you know if you're

4836.18 --> 4840.860000000001
neglecting your body for the sake of the

4839.239 --> 4843.259999999999
mind and what you consider to be the

4840.86 --> 4845.03
spirit that's not healthy it's not

4843.26 --> 4848.4490000000005
balanced and that's where I think people

4845.03 --> 4850.429999999999
have that irrational reaction to any of

4848.449 --> 4852.5599999999995
this information or with someone even

4850.43 --> 4854.63
you know like yeah you know with any of

4852.56 --> 4858.05
it like we're gonna harrier syndrome

4854.63 --> 4860.03
right you know it's a physical unrest

4858.05 --> 4863.54
because they're not doing anything and

4860.03 --> 4865.989
so that keeps them locked in there is

4863.54 --> 4868.79
escapism fear and then the frustration

4865.989 --> 4870.65
starts to literally make them sick and

4868.79 --> 4874.31
they're basically forced to exert it out

4870.65 --> 4875.12
on the Internet as trolling warrior

4874.31 --> 4879.1990000000005
syndrome

4875.12 --> 4880.55
I like the great martyr Arwen instead of

4879.199 --> 4883.429999999999
fight the fighters it's fight the fresh

4880.55 --> 4887.03
air you know and make is like people are

4883.43 --> 4888.469
going outside actually dude like you

4887.03 --> 4890.42
don't even like they're so ridiculous

4888.469 --> 4892.46
that they try to tell people lies like

4890.42 --> 4895.07
they've measured you know the distance

4892.46 --> 4901.1
to the Sun using Venus on like last

4895.07 --> 4903.0199999999995
Thursday like crazy out here

4901.1 --> 4904.31
you know and that's what's funny and

4903.02 --> 4905.360000000001
that's what's even funnier is that they

4904.31 --> 4908.660000000001
don't even realize that they're getting

4905.36 --> 4910.88
rekt like like this was this this debate

4908.66 --> 4912.8
was won by the flat earthers like three

4910.88 --> 4915.35
years ago like you know she and shout

4912.8 --> 4917.0
out to Eric Dubay shout out to ODT shout

4915.35 --> 4920.719
out the principal the movie the

4917.0 --> 4925.219
principal and not the 1986 movie you

4920.719 --> 4926.84
mean you mean the grill but what you

4925.219 --> 4928.94
mean is the technical debate the

4926.84 --> 4932.150000000001
technical side we kind of already won

4928.94 --> 4934.19
and what it's become now more about

4932.15 --> 4937.16
psychological warfare and basically

4934.19 --> 4940.16
upholding a dream and using devious

4937.16 --> 4943.09
tactics to basically disrupt things red

4940.16 --> 4946.61
herring it and then enforcing that dream

4943.09 --> 4950.0
on top of the confusion day so that's

4946.61 --> 4951.65
what I do now I was looking at like it

4950.0 --> 4955.58
just it interests me I was watching on

4951.65 --> 4957.5
shed last night you know a Jed Jed

4955.58 --> 4959.78
skeptic at a show last night Phoebe and

4957.5 --> 4961.579
I Sasha and they go through a variance

4959.78 --> 4964.88
of topics which I couldn't care less for

4961.579 --> 4966.5
however Sasha put it really well was

4964.88 --> 4967.46
just this idea that if you were in a pub

4966.5 --> 4970.639
and this is what I mean about the

4967.46 --> 4973.82
distinction in the orphan dress all

4970.639 --> 4976.400000000001
right if we if we had like the you know

4973.82 --> 4979.639
in a in a very public setting a

4976.4 --> 4983.21
well-versed flat earther can make the

4979.639 --> 4986.9490000000005
case that there is holes in the

4983.21 --> 4989.059
heliocentric globe model very well now

4986.949 --> 4990.138999999999
privately she you know she referred to

4989.059 --> 4991.9400000000005
it and this is just a great you know

4990.139 --> 4993.29
privately it's like yeah [ __ ] hearths

4991.94 --> 4994.73
flat what suck a dick

4993.29 --> 4996.559
you know 600 nautical miles are

4994.73 --> 4999.199
navigated is flat go on and on and on

4996.559 --> 5002.5
and on but publicly this debate has

4999.199 --> 5004.719
already been won by poking the holes the

5002.5 --> 5007.059
necessary holes right into the model

5004.719 --> 5010.389
that's been given to us by the system

5007.059 --> 5012.46
it's like you know I want to I'm going

5010.389 --> 5015.13
to do it no nobody I get it are going

5012.46 --> 5016.809
like a bull it's still being presented

5015.13 --> 5019.4490000000005
on the TV and everything like everything

5016.809 --> 5021.25
is alright Wow literally the hoaxes are

5019.449 --> 5024.219
being cold in it and they're just

5021.25 --> 5026.02
leaving them there basically so it's

5024.219 --> 5027.7300000000005
like an illusion that's been half broken

5026.02 --> 5028.619000000001
but they're still acting like nothing

5027.73 --> 5031.299999999999
happened

5028.619 --> 5032.889
and it doesn't really work in an age

5031.3 --> 5036.909000000001
where everything is conspiracy

5032.889 --> 5039.369
theorizing everything so so I think it's

5036.909 --> 5043.299999999999
like I was gonna make another point

5039.369 --> 5045.699
there it's like this idea that you know

5043.3 --> 5047.619000000001
these things have like this debate has

5045.699 --> 5050.079
been you know kind of had and won in

5047.619 --> 5052.0
that regard I think when when these

5050.079 --> 5053.349
things are brought up brought to light

5052.0 --> 5054.94
and the people who did it you know these

5053.349 --> 5057.55
first ones who did it now some people

5054.94 --> 5059.86
want to criticize like why and what for

5057.55 --> 5061.599
these people were we're making their

5059.86 --> 5063.61
videos and doing all this stuff but if

5061.599 --> 5065.889
anything it is sparked one of the most

5063.61 --> 5069.61
amazing conversations and one of the

5065.889 --> 5071.79
most like you know potentially spiritual

5069.61 --> 5076.15
conversations you know what I mean yeah

5071.79 --> 5078.55
in any it natural informed emanate and

5076.15 --> 5080.65
in this world of like because what we've

5078.55 --> 5082.9890000000005
done is I think that we've and I think

5080.65 --> 5084.638999999999
that if you will that we know that like

5082.989 --> 5085.959999999999
you know the if you want to if you want

5084.639 --> 5086.9490000000005
to think that there's rulers or

5085.96 --> 5088.96
something I don't know where to put it

5086.949 --> 5092.23
but it's like you know we've strayed so

5088.96 --> 5095.08
far into the materialism of the world

5092.23 --> 5097.719999999999
like you know but we've lost our bow

5095.08 --> 5099.28
with the spiritual side of our world and

5097.72 --> 5102.91
like you know we don't recognize the

5099.28 --> 5105.13
like you know we're too scientific or

5102.91 --> 5107.38
not too scientific but we are not and

5105.13 --> 5109.24
this is my art is so cool is that we're

5107.38 --> 5112.3
lit we're really heavy on the side of

5109.24 --> 5114.01
materialism and not balanced enough with

5112.3 --> 5116.35
the side of spiritualism we used as a

5114.01 --> 5120.610000000001
society well I say collectively forgive

5116.35 --> 5123.490000000001
me but like this like any relation of

5120.61 --> 5125.589999999999
course but I speak it I guess forgive me

5123.49 --> 5128.05
for my collectivism in this conversation

5125.59 --> 5131.47
here but it's like like this idea that

5128.05 --> 5134.5
we need as a society more spiritual

5131.47 --> 5137.8
something and this is a real trigger for

5134.5 --> 5140.68
it for a lot of people but do we decide

5137.8 --> 5142.570000000001
in this no but hold on there is upsides

5140.68 --> 5147.1
and downsides to introducing

5142.57 --> 5149.32
spiritualism it can be abused so I think

5147.1 --> 5152.400000000001
it's much more important not to say

5149.32 --> 5155.71
necessarily to focus on spiritualism and

5152.4 --> 5157.8099999999995
you can use it as tools of course like

5155.71 --> 5159.64
if it works it works that should be the

5157.81 --> 5160.780000000001
main focus it works it works but hold on

5159.64 --> 5163.06
if you're literally gonna get

5160.78 --> 5164.53
spiritualism in out there it could be

5163.06 --> 5167.59
manipulated in all kinds of directions

5164.53 --> 5170.2
by controllers again right so that's a

5167.59 --> 5172.4800000000005
game well that's the it's your freedom

5170.2 --> 5174.76
is the [ __ ] dangerous thing you know

5172.48 --> 5177.009999999999
is freedom no but it's also if something

5174.76 --> 5179.08
is official that means that freaking

5177.01 --> 5182.650000000001
corporations are gonna try to weaponize

5179.08 --> 5184.0
it that's that's a problem it's even a

5182.65 --> 5186.009999999999
problem with the legalization of

5184.0 --> 5188.23
cannabis right but technically a

5186.01 --> 5188.92
corporation is just like another wolf in

5188.23 --> 5191.98
the jungle

5188.92 --> 5193.39
did any mean it's just a part of life so

5191.98 --> 5195.429999999999
like you know what I mean is that as we

5193.39 --> 5197.68
are given these tools everyone's given

5195.43 --> 5198.820000000001
these tools even the corporation's but

5197.68 --> 5199.990000000001
you yourself have been given them so

5198.82 --> 5202.21
that's why I talk about even like those

5199.99 --> 5203.44
government it's like you know and what I

5202.21 --> 5205.6
think is what I said about freedom it's

5203.44 --> 5207.82
like what is freedom you know because

5205.6 --> 5209.740000000001
freedom ultimately is responsibility and

5207.82 --> 5213.94
then how free are you if you're laden

5209.74 --> 5215.74
with so much responsibility and so like

5213.94 --> 5216.849999999999
you know it's about self-government like

5215.74 --> 5218.8
you know controlling your own government

5216.85 --> 5220.6
and that's why I say often that I love

5218.8 --> 5223.33
my government because I control my mind

5220.6 --> 5225.22
so why would I not like why would I want

5223.33 --> 5227.22
to tear down my government well when I

5225.22 --> 5228.52
reality I know that I know that it's my

5227.22 --> 5231.67
self-governance

5228.52 --> 5234.22
that makes you know or you could just be

5231.67 --> 5236.2300000000005
pragmatic about it like is attacking

5234.22 --> 5238.63
actually gonna result in something

5236.23 --> 5241.8099999999995
helpful or it's only gonna amp up the

5238.63 --> 5244.08
tension and basically make diplomacy

5241.81 --> 5247.870000000001
that might be necessary at some point

5244.08 --> 5251.13
impossible that's why I say well look

5247.87 --> 5254.38
like even in the core however not even

5251.13 --> 5257.89
ridiculous it gets in within the antifa

5254.38 --> 5260.05
original concept and it is kind of sort

5257.89 --> 5262.570000000001
of alluring to me at first like twenty

5260.05 --> 5264.1900000000005
years ago right they have a point it's

5262.57 --> 5265.84
like yeah we tear the world down because

5264.19 --> 5267.33
it's so [ __ ] up you can't repair it

5265.84 --> 5270.76
that's kind of like the backdrop

5267.33 --> 5273.16
philosophy to it but then it's like oh

5270.76 --> 5275.74
really so is attacking and basically

5273.16 --> 5279.7
corrupting and getting in with criminals

5275.74 --> 5281.41
is that actually gonna result in the

5279.7 --> 5283.929999999999
actual destruction or is it just gonna

5281.41 --> 5285.849999999999
make everything worse and more hellish

5283.93 --> 5288.91
and you're gonna have to live through

5285.85 --> 5290.77
that and well that is the insane part

5288.91 --> 5292.63
about that specifically well what about

5290.77 --> 5293.8
this okay so what I'm saying you're

5292.63 --> 5296.38
right that's the same to that but this

5293.8 --> 5298.18
is why I say yeah let's say the way that

5296.38 --> 5304.24
current things are explained to people

5298.18 --> 5306.280000000001
to me is kind of like a single dad you

5304.24 --> 5309.76
know with an ex-wife that's crazy

5306.28 --> 5312.91
and he lost his job and his daughter

5309.76 --> 5314.95
turns to him and says is everything okay

5312.91 --> 5316.72
daddy you know I mean what's he gonna

5314.95 --> 5319.33
turn around and say well you know honey

5316.72 --> 5320.860000000001
your mom's a [ __ ] my jobs you know my

5319.33 --> 5322.53
job just fired me and I'm better at it

5320.86 --> 5325.45
or is he gonna say to his little girl

5322.53 --> 5327.37
everything's gonna be okay no that

5325.45 --> 5329.679999999999
wouldn't hold on my dad would be wise

5327.37 --> 5331.2699999999995
just well what I'm utilize it a little

5329.68 --> 5333.04
just say yeah I'm having a lot of

5331.27 --> 5335.71
trouble with your mom you know how she

5333.04 --> 5337.51
can get right no no no I'm saying do you

5335.71 --> 5342.46
see how even your toning it down from

5337.51 --> 5343.780000000001
what it really is yeah but yeah and I'm

5342.46 --> 5346.24
saying and that's why I'm saying that

5343.78 --> 5348.099999999999
these people need the ball they need

5346.24 --> 5350.17
Elon Musk to think that they're gonna

5348.1 --> 5351.700000000001
[ __ ] take him out to some [ __ ]

5350.17 --> 5353.41
alien planet that they think they're

5351.7 --> 5356.05
from because they've made a star dust

5353.41 --> 5357.94
right you know I'm saying so like these

5356.05 --> 5360.63
people in my opinion for this for the

5357.94 --> 5362.29
nihilism that was created as Nietzsche

5360.63 --> 5364.12
pointed out that

5362.29 --> 5365.5
when we took ourselves and flung

5364.12 --> 5368.08
ourselves from being the center of the

5365.5 --> 5370.81
universe we killed God and therefore you

5368.08 --> 5373.54
would have nihilism and wars because

5370.81 --> 5375.700000000001
people no longer had any yeah you know

5373.54 --> 5379.6
position in the universe and that's why

5375.7 --> 5381.09
these are the answers to that post it's

5379.6 --> 5384.63
like I look at it like NASA is

5381.09 --> 5388.84
post-modernism you know for the insane

5384.63 --> 5391.63
like you know it's futurism right but

5388.84 --> 5394.06
more consequential futurism because

5391.63 --> 5396.85
which futurism is kind of conceptual a

5394.06 --> 5400.39
start up basic but what futurism really

5396.85 --> 5405.67
does is create people that religiously

5400.39 --> 5407.83
believe in in sci-fi delusion and then

5405.67 --> 5409.93
just trust that it's real so it's kind

5407.83 --> 5413.0199999999995
of like the start up of an actual true

5409.93 --> 5414.7300000000005
religion again hold on no is what the

5413.02 --> 5419.14
little girl believes that her dad told

5414.73 --> 5421.54
her a religion no but no no buts not

5419.14 --> 5422.950000000001
about the talk interaction right but you

5421.54 --> 5425.05
said but it is though because that's

5422.95 --> 5427.2699999999995
where they know that's just it's just on

5425.05 --> 5428.95
top of that the social interaction will

5427.27 --> 5433.570000000001
remain the social interaction it's the

5428.95 --> 5436.99
law that guides you and in that lore is

5433.57 --> 5439.36
introduced misinformation a religion

5436.99 --> 5441.94
pretending to be lore and that just

5439.36 --> 5443.83
catches on if it inspires you that's how

5441.94 --> 5446.5599999999995
I'll get in there and people say the

5443.83 --> 5448.63
same about Astro theology you know that

5446.56 --> 5450.97
we were trying to explain the Stars to

5448.63 --> 5452.71
each other but some [ __ ] thinks you

5450.97 --> 5460.900000000001
know somebody was actually wearing a

5452.71 --> 5462.52
pair of sandals in Egypt well you know

5460.9 --> 5466.0599999999995
some people need that literalization

5462.52 --> 5468.370000000001
they need that you know personifications

5466.06 --> 5471.13
right and that's the things that are

5468.37 --> 5473.92
they can identify with in identification

5471.13 --> 5476.89
with something that is not personified

5473.92 --> 5478.6
it's very tough and like you and I think

5476.89 --> 5481.06
of it like you know how like old timers

5478.6 --> 5483.370000000001
like old timers used to just like you

5481.06 --> 5486.1
know lighten the load of things by lying

5483.37 --> 5489.67
or you're having a white lie you know

5486.1 --> 5491.8
like you know they'll like just like old

5489.67 --> 5494.379
timers will try to make you like used to

5491.8 --> 5496.479
I remember just like old timers back

5494.379 --> 5498.459
that would try to like make you feel

5496.479 --> 5500.169
better by lying a little bit tell you a

5498.459 --> 5502.148999999999
little good story to lift you up and

5500.169 --> 5504.34
give you inspiration I know I love that

5502.149 --> 5505.599
[ __ ] okay right right so like and that's

5504.34 --> 5508.209
my thing is that that's what I think

5505.599 --> 5510.34
people have the the elders of old we're

5508.209 --> 5512.739
trying to convey to us this information

5510.34 --> 5514.3
as we were youngsters and now you have

5512.739 --> 5517.509999999999
to come into the information with a new

5514.3 --> 5518.829000000001
set of eyes right and it's like and but

5517.51 --> 5521.289000000001
there's nothing wrong in it

5518.829 --> 5523.179
and like you know when you have the

5521.289 --> 5524.349
empathy to realize the position that

5523.179 --> 5526.749
they were in mm-hmm

5524.349 --> 5529.329
and then understand that like you know

5526.749 --> 5531.099
it's like you know like any of this

5529.329 --> 5533.199
stuff where people are like oh well you

5531.099 --> 5535.689
know you lied to me like you know your

5533.199 --> 5537.009999999999
teacher lied to me no they did they

5535.689 --> 5538.389
truly believe what they didn't it was

5537.01 --> 5540.939
for a purpose and it was out of the good

5538.389 --> 5543.309
of their heart but the information and

5540.939 --> 5546.369000000001
how we respond and how we collectively

5543.309 --> 5549.189
deal with this information as it as it

5546.369 --> 5551.829
like goes against the stream of our

5549.189 --> 5553.629
society is everything and that's why

5551.829 --> 5555.219
I've often talked about conditional

5553.629 --> 5557.709
acceptance and learning how to deal with

5555.219 --> 5559.84
this society around us to help shape it

5557.709 --> 5562.119
into the garden that we want it to be

5559.84 --> 5564.429
not the place filled with weeds that's

5562.119 --> 5566.8589999999995
unkempt and you know or burned to the

5564.429 --> 5569.649
ground right yeah that's the ultimate

5566.859 --> 5572.499000000001
danger of it is that people could get so

5569.649 --> 5574.899
desperate so insane that they destroy

5572.499 --> 5577.869
everything with the false hope that yeah

5574.899 --> 5579.34
we may escape actually so it doesn't

5577.869 --> 5580.989
really matter we can just go all the way

5579.34 --> 5583.269
and absolutely ruin everything

5580.989 --> 5586.438999999999
that's that's right that's it that's the

5583.269 --> 5589.659000000001
ultimate danger of right and result

5586.439 --> 5591.309
what's scary what the whole idea of you

5589.659 --> 5592.808999999999
know even the us like this idea like

5591.309 --> 5594.55
this fad of socialism

5592.809 --> 5596.289
now granted I used to protest alongside

5594.55 --> 5597.789
socialists and communists back in the

5596.289 --> 5599.379
day when we were against the wars in

5597.789 --> 5601.539
Iraq it's a yeah me too

5599.379 --> 5602.53
and and you know so I have respect for

5601.539 --> 5603.849
some of the people with some of the

5602.53 --> 5605.409
people these days I don't even think

5603.849 --> 5607.059
I've read any of the books that their

5605.409 --> 5609.549999999999
quota you know that they're really

5607.059 --> 5610.809
trying to espouse the idea been riding

5609.55 --> 5613.019
along like a party

5610.809 --> 5615.6990000000005
right and they are willing to be

5613.019 --> 5618.039000000001
totalitarian they'll say we're anything

5615.699 --> 5620.709
they'll do anything they want to be took

5618.039 --> 5623.438999999999
they want to Talat arianism to fight for

5620.709 --> 5625.03
their individuality it's like it's the

5623.439 --> 5626.979
most [ __ ] thing in the world and

5625.03 --> 5627.82
this is where the concept of you know

5626.979 --> 5630.1900000000005
freedom is

5627.82 --> 5631.42
responsibilities do you want to be free

5630.19 --> 5633.009999999999
or do you want to have a government

5631.42 --> 5638.31
stipend that says you can only have this

5633.01 --> 5641.889
much right yep yeah but yeah that

5638.31 --> 5651.6990000000005
they're literally just received as shock

5641.889 --> 5653.139
troops from the loony bin you know

5651.699 --> 5654.699
aren't we all like you know people are

5653.139 --> 5656.349
gonna and this is what I realized is

5654.699 --> 5659.32
that even in the you know any of these

5656.349 --> 5661.0
public I'm not a shock troop Oh I mean

5659.32 --> 5662.159
freaking but right but it's funny to say

5661.0 --> 5668.77
I'm a paladin

5662.159 --> 5670.929
okay actually it's like what is it

5668.77 --> 5672.969
actually sorry

5670.929 --> 5674.77
what are we getting it is it no I was

5672.969 --> 5677.679
wondering what the term came from shock

5674.77 --> 5680.320000000001
troop shock troop is military

5677.679 --> 5681.9400000000005
strategical and it means in any war

5680.32 --> 5684.219
where humans are gonna fight there's

5681.94 --> 5686.409
always gonna be casualties and the

5684.219 --> 5689.05
frontline that are probably gonna get

5686.409 --> 5690.638999999999
all slaughtered when a battle ensues of

5689.05 --> 5694.6900000000005
the old-fashioned type word the shock

5690.639 --> 5697.75
troops so it's like either you put in

5694.69 --> 5699.19
front troops that are so proficient and

5697.75 --> 5701.11
good and well armored that they can

5699.19 --> 5703.0
literally wreck through everything

5701.11 --> 5704.949
without all dying and then you put your

5703.0 --> 5707.29
front troops most armored in front and

5704.949 --> 5710.799999999999
the rest are basically like the after

5707.29 --> 5713.23
stabbers or you're gonna have shock

5710.8 --> 5716.26
troops in front to basically for ya

5713.23 --> 5718.69
smash them into the front troops of the

5716.26 --> 5721.0
other ones the line and then they might

5718.69 --> 5723.579
exhaust it and buckle and then you throw

5721.0 --> 5724.9
in the real troops after that right so

5723.579 --> 5731.409
there's different strategic or

5724.9 --> 5733.69
approaches yeah I play to me but yeah I

5731.409 --> 5736.119
think well I think some of us just we

5733.69 --> 5738.009999999999
were you know as my you know we were we

5736.119 --> 5741.339999999999
were early to the party as my friends

5738.01 --> 5742.929
yes you know and I think you know it's

5741.34 --> 5745.110000000001
funny cuz like for it's funny to watch

5742.929 --> 5747.55
how everyone bearable not everyone but

5745.11 --> 5749.0199999999995
well two things I'm gonna note but it's

5747.55 --> 5750.88
funny out anyone who starts on a flat

5749.02 --> 5754.0
earth debate winds up with the same six

5750.88 --> 5755.829
dudes on it from the baller side like

5754.0 --> 5757.69
you know just just hogging the whole

5755.829 --> 5760.139
show and talking about like their

5757.69 --> 5763.0
lawnmower or like some [ __ ] [ __ ]

5760.139 --> 5765.639
and like they are the most dense so it's

5763.0 --> 5767.889
very lot because of their relative

5765.639 --> 5769.599
density sink and end up at the same

5767.889 --> 5774.1900000000005
point again and again again that's a

5769.599 --> 5775.599
good that's a fair but it's like that

5774.19 --> 5777.879999999999
what it is that we were having these

5775.599 --> 5780.04
conversation

5777.88 --> 5782.29
you know and I mean it's like what I

5780.04 --> 5784.57
could I think you were are at least from

5782.29 --> 5786.76
what I remember I think I'd I've hung

5784.57 --> 5790.509999999999
around in in chats a lot I think you

5786.76 --> 5793.659000000001
were doing panel things before I even

5790.51 --> 5795.639
came on the season I well I thought

5793.659 --> 5798.5199999999995
maybe I remember seeing you before I was

5795.639 --> 5800.9490000000005
out here but I just why I had a channel

5798.52 --> 5802.51
I think but I for example you were in

5800.949 --> 5803.138999999999
the Flat Earth debates like right from

5802.51 --> 5804.88
the start

5803.139 --> 5809.11
I pretty much joined after half a year

5804.88 --> 5810.849
so right well yeah I mean we used to go

5809.11 --> 5814.54
to remember the first flatters debates

5810.849 --> 5816.909000000001
though and the very first day I thought

5814.54 --> 5818.44
this guy sensi ran it or some [ __ ] and

5816.909 --> 5820.449
like you know nobody knew who ran it

5818.44 --> 5822.61
privately like it's like I remember

5820.449 --> 5824.829
getting privately invited to one-on-ones

5822.61 --> 5826.389
and that's where I met rhetoric and

5824.829 --> 5828.04
discourse and a couple of the guys that

5826.389 --> 5831.1900000000005

5887.619 --> 5891.73
here freaking being awesome and talking

5889.42 --> 5893.27
about this info but that [ __ ] happened

5891.73 --> 5895.009999999999
in 2016

5893.27 --> 5897.02
you know I'm like you know it's almost

5895.01 --> 5898.969
like we're over it or at least then I've

5897.02 --> 5901.040000000001
kind of moved on I like doing sick and

5898.969 --> 5903.83
hanging with the community but at the

5901.04 --> 5905.9
same time like you know all these

5903.83 --> 5908.12
arguments have already been won in my

5905.9 --> 5910.5199999999995
opinion right but but still there are

5908.12 --> 5913.82
like ballers arriving on the scene and

5910.52 --> 5917.6900000000005
then literally starting up arguments on

5913.82 --> 5919.61
the exact level where that first where

5917.69 --> 5922.46
the ballers first started doing it they

5919.61 --> 5925.3099999999995
literally start out the exact same

5922.46 --> 5926.87
program and they are just like yeah but

5925.31 --> 5928.34
this is supposed to be it and we're all

5926.87 --> 5931.88
like oh my god that's like three years

5928.34 --> 5934.4890000000005
ago do we now have to like educate you

5931.88 --> 5936.86
on every step of the way and then they

5934.489 --> 5939.62
like get totally shocked now I've seen

5936.86 --> 5941.299999999999
that happen so weird then but new

5939.62 --> 5944.239
ballers come in or they said yeah I've

5941.3 --> 5946.04
been following it and they maybe saw it

5944.239 --> 5947.299999999999
like once three years ago and they come

5946.04 --> 5948.8
on and they're like oh yeah I know

5947.3 --> 5952.34
everything about it and they bring in

5948.8 --> 5953.719
arguments that are so old that even the

5952.34 --> 5955.7300000000005
ballers that constantly hang around

5953.719 --> 5957.41
well you never bring them alive my

5955.73 --> 5959.8099999999995
favorite thing to do I mean I did this

5957.41 --> 5961.37
to countless freaking people is they

5959.81 --> 5963.05
would come in I did it I mean I could

5961.37 --> 5967.5199999999995
list off names that are out here that

5963.05 --> 5969.860000000001
people think are [ __ ] whoever but oh

5967.52 --> 5972.110000000001
yeah they would come in and they would

5969.86 --> 5973.61
still be like oh you're so stupid if

5972.11 --> 5975.32
ladders and you just I remember I just

5973.61 --> 5977.179999999999
used to be like you know what's the

5975.32 --> 5978.98
circumference of the earth and they

5977.18 --> 5980.719
would be like I don't know and I'd be

5978.98 --> 5982.759999999999
like dude then obviously I know more

5980.719 --> 5985.52
about this subject if you do so you

5982.76 --> 5986.75
should just leave hmm you know what I

5985.52 --> 5988.160000000001
mean you should just leave because

5986.75 --> 5989.81
obviously if you don't know that you

5988.16 --> 5991.34
don't know the information at hand you

5989.81 --> 5997.43
really need to go [ __ ] check yourself

5991.34 --> 5998.93
yeah yeah well right I mean like you

5997.43 --> 6000.1900000000005
know and that's where I always like this

5998.93 --> 6002.469
is why when I came out

6000.19 --> 6003.73
look the thing that got me about flat

6002.469 --> 6005.95
earth was that and this look I was

6003.73 --> 6008.2
talking about earlier was that if flat

6005.95 --> 6010.599999999999
earth winds it takes away the ability

6008.2 --> 6012.79
for the government to monetize asteroids

6010.6 --> 6014.7390000000005
monetized space and be able to have a

6012.79 --> 6016.84
debt economy that allows them to print

6014.739 --> 6019.089999999999
more currency and this is a big [ __ ]

6016.84 --> 6020.53
problem and a lot of people don't

6019.09 --> 6022.6900000000005
understand that or make the connection

6020.53 --> 6025.599999999999
and I think that well until that I don't

6022.69 --> 6026.21
see sorry I said I didn't know but I see

6025.6 --> 6028.85
it as

6026.21 --> 6031.91
look what really what it comes down to

6028.85 --> 6036.35
is all the satellite stuff and the space

6031.91 --> 6038.599999999999
things are just money funneling scams

6036.35 --> 6041.2390000000005
they're like theater expensive theater

6038.6 --> 6041.96
with vast apparatus behind it that's

6041.239 --> 6044.239
what it is

6041.96 --> 6046.91
I don't think it really matters about

6044.239 --> 6050.299999999999
the money printing at all really there's

6046.91 --> 6051.5
a big chance that at some point us is to

6050.3 --> 6052.91
the Federal Reserve is going to

6051.5 --> 6055.85
basically said okay now you're gonna

6052.91 --> 6057.62
switch and then they're gonna go to like

6055.85 --> 6061.219
cryptocurrency and they might actually

6057.62 --> 6063.89
like totally do something with the debt

6061.219 --> 6066.469
rearrange it or maybe even default it

6063.89 --> 6068.660000000001
and not be public about it something

6066.469 --> 6071.42
like that all kinds of things can happen

6068.66 --> 6076.01
it's not going to be the end of the

6071.42 --> 6079.67
world as soon as as as Flat Earth is

6076.01 --> 6081.7
revealed through the bankers on the

6079.67 --> 6085.16
other hand they the bankers might just

6081.7 --> 6088.88
assault the country with it if they

6085.16 --> 6091.19
would allow it to be publicized but that

6088.88 --> 6094.4890000000005
ready rather a revenge act because of

6091.19 --> 6097.04
investments no no brother then like the

6094.489 --> 6099.169999999999
natural consequence this is why when I

6097.04 --> 6101.93
came out here I said I I had a lot of

6099.17 --> 6103.6
battles with a lot a lot of uh you know

6101.93 --> 6107.18
gentlemen who are familiar with the law

6103.6 --> 6109.64
and you know about my perspective on it

6107.18 --> 6110.9890000000005
and I could get into it my point is like

6109.64 --> 6113.780000000001
you know because of the way that the

6110.989 --> 6116.66
system is oriented with the nature of

6113.78 --> 6119.54
bonds and such and this need of debt to

6116.66 --> 6121.46
create currency this idea that you would

6119.54 --> 6123.08
have an asteroid there's an article go

6121.46 --> 6126.59
look it up there's an asteroid that's

6123.08 --> 6128.66
worth four core trillion dollars or like

6126.59 --> 6130.79
four hundred quadrillion or what was it

6128.66 --> 6134.63
like I forget the term but it's like you

6130.79 --> 6136.43
know dollars worth of nickel in it so

6134.63 --> 6139.1900000000005
this would be money that people would

6136.43 --> 6140.87
invest to go find nickel and the thing

6139.19 --> 6143.419999999999
that would that would keep that would

6140.87 --> 6146.42
keep the cycle of [ __ ] continuing to

6143.42 --> 6147.7390000000005
go which is great if you're gonna accept

6146.42 --> 6150.17
that there are certain people out there

6147.739 --> 6152.718999999999
that need to be tricked and my thing was

6150.17 --> 6156.2
that if flatus is gonna come out then

6152.719 --> 6157.52
you would have am I still here okay if

6156.2 --> 6159.54
sliders would have come out people would

6157.52 --> 6162.660000000001
learn people would have to learn

6159.54 --> 6165.06
how to discharge dead in order to be

6162.66 --> 6166.95
able to deal with the reality and the

6165.06 --> 6168.240000000001
potential threat that would come if they

6166.95 --> 6170.19
were to collapse the economy because

6168.24 --> 6172.83
they didn't have space anymore

6170.19 --> 6174.54
so this idea what if people were smart

6172.83 --> 6176.34
enough or I don't know smarter whatever

6174.54 --> 6178.47
it is if people could understand it and

6176.34 --> 6180.360000000001
if I'm correct then what people would be

6178.47 --> 6182.52
able to do is discharge through

6180.36 --> 6184.889999999999
forgiveness the debt of any financial

6182.52 --> 6186.870000000001
current any financial instrument because

6184.89 --> 6189.06
you're the creditor and you're the one

6186.87 --> 6192.84
in each one of us individually anywhere

6189.06 --> 6194.79
under the IMF are the creditors owed the

6192.84 --> 6198.6
national interest on the national debt

6194.79 --> 6200.64
but we think we're a cog in the wheel we

6198.6 --> 6203.22
don't understand that we're actually the

6200.64 --> 6206.9400000000005
priority you know this creditor in the

6203.22 --> 6208.320000000001
relationship your answer right so you're

6206.94 --> 6211.049999999999
owed the national interest but the thing

6208.32 --> 6213.599999999999
is that who has ever forgiven that debt

6211.05 --> 6215.49
if we forgave all of the national debt

6213.6 --> 6219.6900000000005
it will give strength to the dollars

6215.49 --> 6221.46
where is fascinating sighs do it and the

6219.69 --> 6224.25
you should have you researched that

6221.46 --> 6227.34
judicially if that's really an option

6224.25 --> 6229.53
I've I look it's because that's

6227.34 --> 6232.8
absolutely cement you have a dual system

6229.53 --> 6234.69
of public and private you know democracy

6232.8 --> 6237.09
and Republic the democracy is as

6234.69 --> 6239.28
Benjamin Franklin said I don't you know

6237.09 --> 6240.99
two wolves in a sheep vote now what's

6239.28 --> 6242.639999999999
this inner beast listen to me ma'am

6240.99 --> 6245.19
listen I'm gonna explain to you explain

6242.64 --> 6247.2300000000005
okay there's a public and a private so

6245.19 --> 6249.36
the Republic the Sheep has a shotgun

6247.23 --> 6251.339999999999
according to what according to Benjamin

6249.36 --> 6253.23
Franklin so my point Peter is that there

6251.34 --> 6255.33
is a public and a private section and

6253.23 --> 6257.459999999999
the point is that the private remains

6255.33 --> 6261.66
private in the sense that you cannot

6257.46 --> 6264.57
access it publicly so the point is that

6261.66 --> 6267.57
this information does exist the judges

6264.57 --> 6269.5199999999995
understand it but we don't cuz we don't

6267.57 --> 6271.53
know who the [ __ ] we are where we live

6269.52 --> 6273.06
or any of that stuff it's like if I ask

6271.53 --> 6275.73
you where do you live you might say a

6273.06 --> 6279.150000000001
country well in reality technically

6275.73 --> 6281.759999999999
don't you live in your body why would

6279.15 --> 6283.379999999999
you say anywhere else you know so Mike

6281.76 --> 6288.900000000001
might think you know regardless don't

6283.38 --> 6290.58
get me all passionate okay look if like

6288.9 --> 6292.7699999999995
you know where else do you live but in

6290.58 --> 6292.98
your body right and you know and you

6292.77 --> 6295.5
know

6292.98 --> 6298.2
how could you be a name if a name is a

6295.5 --> 6300.84
word and these kind of philosophical

6298.2 --> 6302.97
concepts can lead one down to what some

6300.84 --> 6303.84
of the normies will refer to paranoid

6302.97 --> 6305.58
rabbit holes

6303.84 --> 6307.53
but in [ __ ] reality when you go look

6305.58 --> 6309.36
it up there's actual you know case

6307.53 --> 6311.34
matter to back it up like US citizens

6309.36 --> 6313.549999999999
are not protected under the first eight

6311.34 --> 6317.7
amendments to the Federal Constitution

6313.55 --> 6319.38
that's a fact okay which means that

6317.7 --> 6321.09
United States citizens are not allowed

6319.38 --> 6323.43
to let sit and this this goes across the

6321.09 --> 6324.81
board because you and you know here's

6323.43 --> 6326.280000000001
the thing about the US and I'm just

6324.81 --> 6328.200000000001
gonna do this briefly because we're is

6326.28 --> 6330.719999999999
this idea that we respect the idea that

6328.2 --> 6333.8099999999995
your rights come from God and if they

6330.72 --> 6336.150000000001
can get us you know like man was given

6333.81 --> 6340.650000000001
rights from God if they can get us to

6336.15 --> 6342.089999999999
want human rights over god-given rights

6340.65 --> 6344.3099999999995
then we're [ __ ]

6342.09 --> 6346.62
yeah become then it come becomes

6344.31 --> 6348.780000000001
technically democratized or something or

6346.62 --> 6350.88
well now you're just dealing in a collab

6348.78 --> 6353.099999999999
I mean I think they could then exchange

6350.88 --> 6354.6900000000005
what those human rights are like well

6353.1 --> 6356.370000000001
the thing is that now you're not godly

6354.69 --> 6358.349999999999
you're not to be true like when you go

6356.37 --> 6360.57
into court you get a chance to speak

6358.35 --> 6363.33
they give you your day in court because

6360.57 --> 6365.91
they figure you are a vessel of an a and

6363.33 --> 6368.1
in you know a creation of the Creator

6365.91 --> 6369.51
that you know that they you know and

6368.1 --> 6371.79
does it not say in the judge in the

6369.51 --> 6373.8
courtrooms and God We Trust doesn't it

6371.79 --> 6375.21
say on the money in god we trust'

6373.8 --> 6376.71
the only [ __ ] who doesn't

6375.21 --> 6378.42
believe in God in the courtrooms to do

6376.71 --> 6382.5
who gets asked who are you

6378.42 --> 6384.2390000000005
and then you say I'm a name and then you

6382.5 --> 6386.19
act as accordingly and they're like you

6384.239 --> 6389.0599999999995
know the names go put in the jail you

6386.19 --> 6392.549999999999
know yeah I know I'm one of those and

6389.06 --> 6394.1900000000005
like Descartes said he who thinks you

6392.55 --> 6396.75
know like I or I think therefore I am

6394.19 --> 6403.95
therefore he who does not think is

6396.75 --> 6406.61
nothing you get nothing okay forget yeah

6403.95 --> 6410.01
I lost a bit

6406.61 --> 6415.11
track okay it's getting a little

6410.01 --> 6416.25
complicated that's why the flatter shits

6415.11 --> 6419.009999999999
like that's why I had such a little hard

6416.25 --> 6420.66
time with the people I met out here they

6419.01 --> 6422.1900000000005
didn't quite grasp what I was [ __ ]

6420.66 --> 6423.54
talking about and then they were

6422.19 --> 6425.3099999999995
thinking I'm like you know some like I'm

6423.54 --> 6426.86
sure you try to give you some trouble in

6425.31 --> 6428.150000000001
this and that it's like no

6426.86 --> 6429.98
you know anything like this is about

6428.15 --> 6432.259999999999
education it's like you know and I think

6429.98 --> 6434.54
one thing I learned out here is that

6432.26 --> 6435.77
people instead of like you know or like

6434.54 --> 6438.2
instead of trying to get people to think

6435.77 --> 6440.18
about flatter sort of think the earth is

6438.2 --> 6443.45
flat it's the idea of getting people's

6440.18 --> 6445.52
to think you know - just think

6443.45 --> 6447.11
because if you if you're not thinking

6445.52 --> 6449.21
you know like I said Descartes I think

6447.11 --> 6451.04
therefore I am and you know the

6449.21 --> 6451.7300000000005
alternative is if you don't think you

6451.04 --> 6456.14
are nothing

6451.73 --> 6459.589999999999
I don't know I don't I know I don't

6456.14 --> 6462.5
think so I think that thinking is

6459.59 --> 6464.96
actually a self-generating less traction

6462.5 --> 6467.78
if you are what nobody know what it's

6464.96 --> 6470.15
semantical it's semantically I think

6467.78 --> 6472.49
that thinking is overestimated I think

6470.15 --> 6476.599999999999
that thinking is also starting from the

6472.49 --> 6479.32
atheist going come on come on ISA shut

6476.6 --> 6483.14
up I'm explaining now okay think you

6479.32 --> 6485.66
know thinking is derived conceptually

6483.14 --> 6488.81
from an atheist approach that's how

6485.66 --> 6491.45
thinking is regarded in general okay

6488.81 --> 6494.870000000001
what it is is basically reason out

6491.45 --> 6496.67
technical things and not letting your

6494.87 --> 6498.32
intuition or feelings or anything get in

6496.67 --> 6502.49
the way it's very susceptible to

6498.32 --> 6504.469999999999
programming it it it stares to bypass

6502.49 --> 6509.84
know what I'm what I would say is not

6504.47 --> 6514.33
you have to think no you have to be

6509.84 --> 6518.360000000001
sensible you have to use your senses and

6514.33 --> 6520.79
maintain them and not let them be ruined

6518.36 --> 6522.5599999999995
or damaged you have to take care of

6520.79 --> 6525.53
yourself and be sensible about

6522.56 --> 6528.070000000001
everything and if you do that then your

6525.53 --> 6530.8099999999995
sense is combined with your minds can

6528.07 --> 6534.53
actually create critical thoughts and

6530.81 --> 6536.150000000001
then you're you're a lot safer because

6534.53 --> 6538.04
then you can maneuver your way through

6536.15 --> 6540.549999999999
everything much better because you

6538.04 --> 6542.84
actually know what it is because you are

6540.55 --> 6545.09
critically thinking you are on the level

6542.84 --> 6546.59
because you have all your senses you're

6545.09 --> 6551.03
not just going by what your thoughts

6546.59 --> 6552.92
mentally do you see the difference right

6551.03 --> 6556.66
but what I'm saying is that that is the

6552.92 --> 6559.49
is the you know I think therefore I am

6556.66 --> 6561.86
you know that's me I am

6559.49 --> 6563.719999999999
and embracing the I am if I'm not

6561.86 --> 6565.549999999999
mistaken if I'm now I think then I think

6563.72 --> 6571.58
that's a slight philosophical missed

6565.55 --> 6572.6
miss miss extrapolation what is it how

6571.58 --> 6574.28
could she make it up words

6572.6 --> 6579.97
no yeah there's no finding the right

6574.28 --> 6582.759999999999
words it's too hot I think it's a

6579.97 --> 6585.47
misinterpretation I think it's the wrong

6582.76 --> 6588.070000000001
interpretation of that I think that it

6585.47 --> 6591.52
was the one that made that up was very

6588.07 --> 6595.15
philosophical and mental about it and

6591.52 --> 6597.950000000001
philosophy has detachment from the

6595.15 --> 6600.349999999999
common sense and spirituality as well

6597.95 --> 6604.58
although it does approach elements of it

6600.35 --> 6606.26
it's very mental in nature so that would

6604.58 --> 6608.26
make sense that it would say that that a

6606.26 --> 6610.79
philosopher would say yeah I

6608.26 --> 6614.42
philosophize so I exist

6610.79 --> 6619.3
well check it out this philosophy come

6614.42 --> 6622.64
isn't science a branch of philosophy no

6619.3 --> 6625.88
look it up no it was founded upon it

6622.64 --> 6629.450000000001
it's very specific method so it brings

6625.88 --> 6632.96
it forth okay are you your mother is ISA

6629.45 --> 6635.2699999999995
you your mother am I not you know her

6632.96 --> 6639.47
son that's not the question

6635.27 --> 6640.1900000000005
are you are you your mother that's what

6639.47 --> 6642.650000000001
I'm saying

6640.19 --> 6646.61
are you physically attached to your

6642.65 --> 6650.96
mother are you a you know that's right

6646.61 --> 6654.41
so philosophy basically allowed the

6650.96 --> 6656.81
scientific method to be conceived raised

6654.41 --> 6660.53
on the father it is not philosophy it's

6656.81 --> 6664.64
very simple philosophy is the father of

6660.53 --> 6666.49
science sure okay so like you and what

6664.64 --> 6668.72
I'm trying to say is that science

6666.49 --> 6670.94
inevitably you know being that it's from

6668.72 --> 6675.17
philosophy you know I mean has the

6670.94 --> 6676.58
traits of so soft it no it doesn't well

6675.17 --> 6679.78
don't you have the shape but isn't your

6676.58 --> 6682.73
face like your mother and your father's

6679.78 --> 6686.42
not really partial right but it is

6682.73 --> 6688.099999999999
though right no no no it's different

6686.42 --> 6691.01
nobody nobody my father and mother look

6688.1 --> 6692.160000000001
very different nobody says oh you look

6691.01 --> 6696.26
like your father I

6692.16 --> 6696.26
they do say they look at my father yes

6696.83 --> 6700.7699999999995
but they're not saying oh you look

6698.91 --> 6703.23
exactly like your dad now it's just like

6700.77 --> 6706.26
oh it's obvious that you are related

6703.23 --> 6709.11
because you have similarities but that

6706.26 --> 6712.02
doesn't make him me a clone of my dad at

6709.11 --> 6714.48
all right well I'm just trying to you

6712.02 --> 6717.18
can see that they're like my point is

6714.48 --> 6719.669999999999
that philosophy is the father of science

6717.18 --> 6721.56
right so like you know and like you know

6719.67 --> 6723.93
and I was kind of thinking about the

6721.56 --> 6727.02
survey about how you know and art is the

6723.93 --> 6730.5
father of philosophy right and fire is

6727.02 --> 6732.42
the father of metalworking does it make

6730.5 --> 6735.99
everything metalworking fire related

6732.42 --> 6738.15
though but well yeah one thing can spawn

6735.99 --> 6740.28
for something completely different that

6738.15 --> 6743.3099999999995
no longer has any resemblance to what it

6740.28 --> 6745.83
came from okay and science is very

6743.31 --> 6748.02
specifically not philosophical base

6745.83 --> 6751.53
because philosophy is specifically

6748.02 --> 6753.330000000001
ethereal it is conceptual mechanics just

6751.53 --> 6755.79
like math which is also a form of

6753.33 --> 6758.7
philosophy basically grounded in logic

6755.79 --> 6763.29
but scientific method is not philosophy

6758.7 --> 6768.54
it is specifically detached from it onto

6763.29 --> 6771.48
the physical realm it's just as much as

6768.54 --> 6774.21
you could say that Lucifer is God

6771.48 --> 6775.889999999999
because God and Lucifer were in the same

6774.21 --> 6779.55
realm then he cast him down and became

6775.89 --> 6782.43
physical that not saying that but it's a

6779.55 --> 6784.92
bit overdramatic maybe but I'm just

6782.43 --> 6787.320000000001
saying if it's not philosophy because

6784.92 --> 6789.96
what makes philosophy so philosophy is

6787.32 --> 6792.66
that it is ethereal and it is conceptual

6789.96 --> 6795.54
mechanics and a scientific specifically

6792.66 --> 6797.36
is not that is like the core to it if

6795.54 --> 6800.04
you take us out can't we like all

6797.36 --> 6805.08
objectively agree that you experience

6800.04 --> 6809.78
the world subjectively that's up for a

6805.08 --> 6813.69
philosophical debate no well yeah I mean

6809.78 --> 6815.639999999999
so is it right seems to be that there

6813.69 --> 6818.28
could be no other truth then at least

6815.64 --> 6821.04
that that's we can objectively accept

6818.28 --> 6822.42
I'll bet you I could if I go out and

6821.04 --> 6825.63
look find a philosophic or that

6822.42 --> 6827.37
philosopher that would give a proper

6825.63 --> 6831.45
rebuttal to that that would dispel that

6827.37 --> 6833.22
notion of the things about ethereal

6831.45 --> 6835.41
mechanics you can make anything true

6833.22 --> 6836.7300000000005
with ethereal much I think but I think

6835.41 --> 6838.5199999999995
like if you're gonna be grounded in

6836.73 --> 6841.349999999999
reality that could be pretty [ __ ]

6838.52 --> 6843.93
self-evident because like you know I

6841.35 --> 6845.85
think that if you're gonna have the you

6843.93 --> 6847.860000000001
know like everyone recognizes that and I

6845.85 --> 6851.09
think it's cool George Orwell wrote how

6847.86 --> 6853.0199999999995
you know in 1984 about when

6851.09 --> 6854.34
what's-his-name's talk about Brian

6853.02 --> 6858.21
doesn't Winston he's like you know

6854.34 --> 6859.4400000000005
reality is is in the skull you know II

6858.21 --> 6861.4800000000005
mean so like you know anything that they

6859.44 --> 6863.28
can shape and do with it you know no I

6861.48 --> 6866.459999999999
don't think I think it's the response an

6863.28 --> 6870.719999999999
actual programs natural the genetic

6866.46 --> 6874.46
programmed response to things the

6870.72 --> 6877.2
natural response the instinct II that

6874.46 --> 6879.21
that is the thing that is always in a

6877.2 --> 6881.82
certain way and then whatever you try to

6879.21 --> 6883.56
program on top of it that might

6881.82 --> 6885.54
eventually scare you but the original

6883.56 --> 6888.450000000001
programming is always gonna result in

6885.54 --> 6890.64
the same type of judgment that's what

6888.45 --> 6893.46
some people religiously call logos or

6890.64 --> 6895.59
the do God's Way but that's a natural

6893.46 --> 6899.55
thing that doesn't deviate that doesn't

6895.59 --> 6901.83
evolve over time our culture and our

6899.55 --> 6905.1
mental faculties in our approaches

6901.83 --> 6907.92
evolve but the actual instincts are

6905.1 --> 6910.14
gonna always be the same unless we are

6907.92 --> 6913.29
completely genetically engineered out of

6910.14 --> 6915.3
it somehow so I think that's the thing

6913.29 --> 6918.54
about life though it's like I look at it

6915.3 --> 6922.9400000000005
like you know certain solutions to

6918.54 --> 6927.06
problems are what's the term

6922.94 --> 6932.82
counterintuitive that's right and so

6927.06 --> 6935.7300000000005
like you know when we learn to forge the

6932.82 --> 6936.299999999999
counterintuitive nature of things into

6935.73 --> 6939.57
our being

6936.3 --> 6941.37
you cannot success and that involves a

6939.57 --> 6943.889999999999
certain element stroke it's a puffle off

6941.37 --> 6947.97
condition to allow yourself to logically

6943.89 --> 6951.51
corrupt in order to get night well no

6947.97 --> 6953.7300000000005
it's not yeah it is it's the it's the

6951.51 --> 6956.31
remedy it can be the remedy of I think

6953.73 --> 6959.339
about it like this what natural ISM can

6956.31 --> 6962.01
be the remedy to two years no it's

6959.339 --> 6964.859
always temporary reason why you do such

6962.01 --> 6966.959
things well what I'm saying right but

6964.859 --> 6970.979
I'm saying that like I'm looking at it

6966.959 --> 6973.229
in a certain sense of I mean it could be

6970.979 --> 6975.3
akin to like you know grass growing or

6973.229 --> 6976.9490000000005
some of that or like a garden it's like

6975.3 --> 6978.839
you know you could let the garden just

6976.949 --> 6982.379
take over with weeds and call it

6978.839 --> 6984.359
naturalism or you could you know make a

6982.379 --> 6986.339
beautiful garden with flowers and all

6984.359 --> 6989.780000000001
kinds of different things and elevate

6986.339 --> 6992.339
the environment because of your

6989.78 --> 6995.099
attention to it and so what I'm saying

6992.339 --> 6997.409
is that if you are you know if we

6995.099 --> 7000.349
cultivate the garden it's better than

6997.409 --> 7001.699
letting all the weeds go you know I mean

7000.349 --> 7004.01
but like you know just letting the weeds

7001.699 --> 7006.409
flourish and just you know uh what else

7004.01 --> 7007.939
would I do and not doing the opposite

7006.409 --> 7010.339
the counterintuitive to what nature

7007.939 --> 7012.079000000001
actually you know maybe was going to lay

7010.339 --> 7014.239
out and do you know this is our

7012.079 --> 7016.518999999999
expression on the earth this is what man

7014.239 --> 7018.289
you know is isn't man the caretaker of

7016.519 --> 7020.329000000001
the earth can we you know are we here to

7018.289 --> 7021.679
make gardens yep you know to make

7020.329 --> 7025.759999999999
beautiful things and like and these

7021.679 --> 7027.709
things are counterintuitive to you know

7025.76 --> 7030.559
what nature I mean nature would have you

7027.709 --> 7032.419
[ __ ] die on a rock and not give you a

7030.559 --> 7034.189
goddamn thing you'd have to go but you

7032.419 --> 7036.169
know that's why we had to learn fire and

7034.189 --> 7038.149
tools and and all the stupid show about

7036.169 --> 7039.949
we have to seek this struggle in order

7038.149 --> 7041.780000000001
to continue this evolution I think that

7039.949 --> 7045.6089999999995
mankind right now with this age of

7041.78 --> 7048.429
information is now going through the

7045.609 --> 7053.899
informational and I think to some extent

7048.429 --> 7056.689
spiritual like you know revolution and

7053.899 --> 7057.7390000000005
well yeah like adventure because like

7056.689 --> 7061.01
you know like you know it's like this is

7057.739 --> 7062.659
the information age you know information

7061.01 --> 7065.3
is available we have the Library of

7062.659 --> 7068.058999999999
Alexandria at our fingertips right yeah

7065.3 --> 7069.7390000000005
before you'd have to be special or rich

7068.059 --> 7073.399
and then if you were lucky you would be

7069.739 --> 7076.638999999999
exposed to extreme information and now

7073.399 --> 7079.669000000001
it's like okay if you can manage not to

7076.639 --> 7082.039
be caught up in something insane then

7079.669 --> 7084.559
you might also find the most incredible

7082.039 --> 7086.78
stuff out there if you go digging that's

7084.559 --> 7090.26
unique opportunity today yeah that's

7086.78 --> 7091.969
true yeah you know and I just think that

7090.26 --> 7092.75
that is you know it's just where we're

7091.969 --> 7095.39
at man like

7092.75 --> 7099.59
you know whether it's how we interacted

7095.39 --> 7101.3
and go you know and see the world so you

7099.59 --> 7103.01
know that's why I can't get too wrapped

7101.3 --> 7104.93
up in the drama things because it's like

7103.01 --> 7108.110000000001
we want to be planting gardens that's

7104.93 --> 7111.400000000001
right I mean not argue maybe but hey if

7108.11 --> 7114.41
if something in the garden actually dies

7111.4 --> 7116.719999999999
then it would be better to just remove

7114.41 --> 7119.51
it than to just have that husk sit there

7116.72 --> 7123.41
taking up space potentially infecting

7119.51 --> 7125.21
others with fungus so yeah yeah of

7123.41 --> 7127.82
course and that's part of it and that's

7125.21 --> 7130.67
all that is is that that caretaking of

7127.82 --> 7131.929999999999
the you know of the of the earth and

7130.67 --> 7133.7
making something beautiful I think

7131.93 --> 7136.700000000001
that's what you know we're we're kind of

7133.7 --> 7139.16
given the opportunity to do but I think

7136.7 --> 7141.38
some people don't you know may not see

7139.16 --> 7145.099999999999
it like that and that's what you know I

7141.38 --> 7148.1900000000005
think as mankind develops in this way of

7145.1 --> 7150.88
knowledge and etiquette and you know and

7148.19 --> 7155.21
if we can you know politely

7150.88 --> 7156.62
you know eviscerate our adversaries you

7155.21 --> 7159.92
know through diplomacy and through

7156.62 --> 7162.47
knowledge then that is better than

7159.92 --> 7164.51
trying to you know take it up and you

7162.47 --> 7166.46
know argue and yell and do this that the

7164.51 --> 7169.01
other thing when in reality I think the

7166.46 --> 7171.68
solutions are much more simple it's like

7169.01 --> 7173.150000000001
almost like in Jitsu there's a there's

7171.68 --> 7176.39
like a principle called like using

7173.15 --> 7178.429999999999
levers so like you use levers with the

7176.39 --> 7180.5
body's mechanics to try to avoid using

7178.43 --> 7182.51
strength right and you're making you

7180.5 --> 7185.45
know and so it's using levers and

7182.51 --> 7187.7300000000005
fulcrums versus using you know brute

7185.45 --> 7191.09
force and strength and you know tit for

7187.73 --> 7194.419999999999
tat [ __ ] [ __ ] mm-hmm right but

7191.09 --> 7196.37
yeah do have to realize that since the

7194.42 --> 7199.25
internet came on at first it wasn't that

7196.37 --> 7201.44
bad there were like Joker Joker people

7199.25 --> 7204.17
sometimes kind of trolling but it

7201.44 --> 7206.599999999999
wouldn't be that insane but since the

7204.17 --> 7209.45
media has basically started weaponizing

7206.6 --> 7212.54
politics and bringing out this insane

7209.45 --> 7215.15
anti human type of promotion behavioral

7212.54 --> 7217.31
promotion that's the time where

7215.15 --> 7222.62
basically everybody's getting burden and

7217.31 --> 7225.76
this giant giant internet platform from

7222.62 --> 7230.769
basically just being a relief tear up

7225.76 --> 7233.38
unity became a necessary ground to spill

7230.769 --> 7235.570000000001
your guts because of the stress of

7233.38 --> 7239.1990000000005
society and that's how it became a troll

7235.57 --> 7241.509999999999
[ __ ] fast it's because of the stress

7239.199 --> 7244.598999999999
that came on top because of the total

7241.51 --> 7247.0
unreasonable 'ti and trying to be forced

7244.599 --> 7249.789
on people that's what's causing the

7247.0 --> 7255.13
troll plague it's a direct response of

7249.789 --> 7257.559
it I'm certain internet could be

7255.13 --> 7261.849
beautiful it could be all people that

7257.559 --> 7263.26
are all reasonably know naturally like

7261.849 --> 7265.78
yeah but what about this like I remember

7263.26 --> 7267.46
like they used to be like Manhattan

7265.78 --> 7269.889
neighborhood that were great used to

7267.46 --> 7272.65
call up these guys what I've shows you

7269.889 --> 7274.0
can still do it you know on TV and they

7272.65 --> 7276.28
got like a local channel and they're

7274.0 --> 7277.539
like : do that and it's like you know

7276.28 --> 7279.518999999999
somebody calls it in there like you know

7277.539 --> 7281.018999999999
your mother sucks and it's like you know

7279.519 --> 7282.969
they just keep getting thirty million

7281.019 --> 7285.34
phone calls of like people like oh your

7282.969 --> 7293.679
mother sucks it's like it's just [ __ ]

7285.34 --> 7297.579
hilarious like you know I disagree I

7293.679 --> 7301.869
think it's not like rolling I don't like

7297.579 --> 7303.969
it I broke even the original spam joke

7301.869 --> 7306.73
from Monty Python guidance I got sick of

7303.969 --> 7308.67
it you know I'm not a dick but it's like

7306.73 --> 7310.78
I I like to have straight-up

7308.67 --> 7312.55
conversations and laugh and [ __ ] like

7310.78 --> 7314.079
that but some people take it to the next

7312.55 --> 7316.119000000001
levels I think like you know some people

7314.079 --> 7319.21
are Alerus with it but it's essentially

7316.119 --> 7322.179
that to me I look at it like it's just

7319.21 --> 7324.159
like you know you're on a Manhattan

7322.179 --> 7326.139
neighborhood network in 1970 and

7324.159 --> 7330.25
somebody's calling in and going like hey

7326.139 --> 7331.4800000000005
you mother it's just it's just what it

7330.25 --> 7333.4
is it's not like a big deal like

7331.48 --> 7336.549999999999
everyone gets so [ __ ] offended but

7333.4 --> 7338.259999999999
back then it was still kind of no dude

7336.55 --> 7339.88
you see these people losing their mind

7338.26 --> 7341.92
up because of these people they react

7339.88 --> 7344.4400000000005
the same way that people are online

7341.92 --> 7346.869
reacting with people throw them they get

7344.44 --> 7349.21
all butthurt and [ __ ] all this video

7346.869 --> 7351.759999999999
this wrong that's me yeah bro what do

7349.21 --> 7355.539
you mean [ __ ] good looking oh man I

7351.76 --> 7360.84
want yeah look up [ __ ] stop the F

7355.539 --> 7360.84
please okay I'm yelled at for that

7361.21 --> 7369.14
stop it just e you don't need that

7365.9 --> 7372.28
freaking words or effing words you don't

7369.14 --> 7378.08
need it just don't use it

7372.28 --> 7380.3
pollution I'll try I'll try I'll see

7378.08 --> 7381.95
nothing list in my head I'll say effing

7380.3 --> 7383.68
when I'm freaking pissed off at an

7381.95 --> 7390.53
individual that's when I started saying

7383.68 --> 7394.030000000001
okay I like freakin actually I'll come

7390.53 --> 7396.53
at you with some good news ah but uh

7394.03 --> 7399.5599999999995
that's it by the way if you could

7396.53 --> 7408.38
basically amuse the Hangout I really

7399.56 --> 7408.950000000001
know a break Oh music no no I need to go

7408.38 --> 7417.47
downstairs

7408.95 --> 7423.55
I'll be back okay cool yeah what's up

7417.47 --> 7426.41
mr. McKenzie Cleary mr. v ye nephew

7423.55 --> 7429.9800000000005
Daniel left over you going it's what our

7426.41 --> 7435.86
brother mr. Pollard write on it when I

7429.98 --> 7440.66
can be more sad man nice yo what up

7435.86 --> 7448.349999999999

7518.34 --> 7530.189
[Music]

7531.45 --> 7541.66
bring out the guitar yes sorry I had I

7538.18 --> 7558.67
had to basically displace a cup of

7541.66 --> 7561.82
coffee and a pot of tea sir yeah I loved

7558.67 --> 7564.07
that little bird thing yeah hmm at the

7561.82 --> 7567.28
end do you have like a little uh the

7564.07 --> 7570.73
early bird got the intro yeah thanks

7567.28 --> 7573.07
yes it's cool it's short but good it's

7570.73 --> 7575.589999999999
like a [ __ ] second ah dude that

7573.07 --> 7578.5
shit's dope as well whoever made that

7575.59 --> 7581.56
today I made it well the song was made

7578.5 --> 7583.69
by Chris very specifically for me so

7581.56 --> 7585.330000000001

was great I had a great smoke with that

8039.869 --> 8044.9
music I love it

8041.449 --> 8047.789
thanks man yay

8044.9 --> 8051.268999999999
72 thank you everybody yeah my my

8047.789 --> 8053.209
friends our people in chat definitely

8051.269 --> 8057.2390000000005
seems to be it seemed to be enjoying it

8053.209 --> 8062.03
did much appreciate was there anything

8057.239 --> 8066.678999999999
else you want to discuss maybe mm-hmm

8062.03 --> 8070.65
just the 600 nautical miles just you

8066.679 --> 8073.769
know don't let that go man they navigate

8070.65 --> 8075.869
600 nautical miles as flat and that's

8073.769 --> 8077.999
just how could they you know and it just

8075.869 --> 8081.179
ticked to me it take and how do they

8077.999 --> 8083.4
navigate 600 nautical miles as flat how

8081.179 --> 8085.829
can they see 100 and you know flat no

8083.4 --> 8088.469
curvature really at 120,000 feet and

8085.829 --> 8090.449
then say that you could see obstruction

8088.469 --> 8093.63
and curvature at [ __ ] 20 miles away

8090.449 --> 8095.669
hmm yeah it's just you know I'll give

8093.63 --> 8098.189
you that you know you could maybe see a

8095.669 --> 8100.949
little bit of curvature at 120,000 feet

8098.189 --> 8102.900000000001
but you got to give me that no boat ever

8100.949 --> 8106.65
went over the [ __ ] horizon it because

8102.9 --> 8110.179
of the curve of the earth the whole

8106.65 --> 8112.499
curvature concept is ridiculous it is

8110.179 --> 8116.63
it's literally cognitive dissonance

8112.499 --> 8119.429
about standard optical effects so

8116.63 --> 8123.269
doesn't matter to me at this point what

8119.429 --> 8126.719
you call it why the concealment effect

8123.269 --> 8129.479
oh we can we can like ranty expose the

8126.719 --> 8132.209
obstruction due to tidal bulging at sea

8129.479 --> 8133.829000000001
areas so that's a very significant

8132.209 --> 8136.438999999999
factor but as for the rest of it the

8133.829 --> 8138.539
consumer why that happens well you could

8136.439 --> 8141.030000000001
bring in all kinds of explanation like

8138.539 --> 8141.86
the limited viewing angle resolution

8141.03 --> 8147.96
issue

8141.86 --> 8150.719999999999
very complex but for me really so for me

8147.96 --> 8153.15
it's just I just know it happens it

8150.72 --> 8155.1
happens under any circumstance it

8153.15 --> 8157.71
happens on the confirmed flat surfaces

8155.1 --> 8160.8
when you look over them so what does it

8157.71 --> 8163.8
really matter you know it's there it's

8160.8 --> 8169.02
part of optics is natural it it cannot

8163.8 --> 8171.42
yield any direct conclusion to whether

8169.02 --> 8177.0
what we see out there is round or flat

8171.42 --> 8178.71
based on that optical phenomena yeah I

8177.0 --> 8181.02
think and you know and that's why I like

8178.71 --> 8183.51
to you know as I've often said how do

8181.02 --> 8185.160000000001
you base your you know philosophical

8183.51 --> 8187.320000000001
outlook on the world

8185.16 --> 8189.889999999999
and your cosmological outlook on the

8187.32 --> 8192.93
world because of an optical phenomena

8189.89 --> 8196.470000000001
you know or you know or a laser ring

8192.93 --> 8198.45
gyro mmm or you know or you know

8196.47 --> 8200.07
anything to do with spectroscopy it's

8198.45 --> 8201.900000000001
like you know peak keep in mind to the

8200.07 --> 8204.24
people out there or fi it's like the

8201.9 --> 8206.52
idea of like should I think if you're a

8204.24 --> 8208.92
really diehard baller then you should

8206.52 --> 8211.77
really make a petition to end the song

8208.92 --> 8214.65
twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder

8211.77 --> 8217.380000000001
what you are because no give them any

8214.65 --> 8219.99
ideas because we know what they are we

8217.38 --> 8221.699999999999
know exactly helium they stopped singing

8219.99 --> 8223.35
that song now we don't know that

8221.7 --> 8224.58
actually know what twinkle twinkle [ __ ]

8223.35 --> 8226.68
is it's like you know and they're not

8224.58 --> 8234.12
[ __ ] tangible for the you did it

8226.68 --> 8235.98
again I'm an artist I try to use it

8234.12 --> 8238.95
artists artistically I'm set it to a

8235.98 --> 8243.14
snow cloud hey it sounded to all the

8238.95 --> 8248.25
good people up here and Mackenzie indeed

8243.14 --> 8249.81
yeah thank you I love your show are we

8248.25 --> 8251.76
gonna keep it you know keep it rockin

8249.81 --> 8253.97
really good vibes thank you for having

8251.76 --> 8256.89
me on dude yeah yeah you're welcome

8253.97 --> 8258.33
you know I don't know if I you're making

8256.89 --> 8261.05
them over already don't know whatever

8258.33 --> 8264.84
but I should be outside and you know

8261.05 --> 8268.41
make there you know if you I didn't know

8264.84 --> 8270.03
if you were trying to I don't have to

8268.41 --> 8273.66
show or something yeah yeah yeah well

8270.03 --> 8276.769
depends look we've been going for is it

8273.66 --> 8280.38
two hours 50 minutes

8276.769 --> 8282.09
I wouldn't object to go to make it three

8280.38 --> 8284.938999999998
hours but it's it's up to you you know

8282.09 --> 8288.689
if yeah if run out of juice as it were

8284.939 --> 8291.960000000001
that in the show depends on the night oh

8288.689 --> 8293.579
yeah a good point I think or if somebody

8291.96 --> 8295.469
else would like to join the panel maybe

8293.579 --> 8296.849
well I think we've made some good points

8295.469 --> 8300.0
today it's like you know even just I

8296.849 --> 8302.67
think those are really you know pointing

8300.0 --> 8305.55
things is the idea that like you know

8302.67 --> 8307.229
the that like you know this this notion

8305.55 --> 8309.63
of the ball and all these things it's

8307.229 --> 8313.139
like it's kind of like it has to exist

8309.63 --> 8315.118999999999
for some economic purpose even

8313.139 --> 8317.038999999999
regardless of the you know the guys I

8315.119 --> 8319.17
love talking about the idea 600 nautical

8317.039 --> 8321.09
miles per day but for certain people man

8319.17 --> 8323.929
they just gotta have their there

8321.09 --> 8325.829
spinning ball or else they just break

8323.929 --> 8327.239
you know and I mean and like you know

8325.829 --> 8328.949
and I don't want I don't care about them

8327.239 --> 8331.288999999999
breaking you know I don't want them to

8328.949 --> 8334.139000000001
break I want everyone to be okay you

8331.289 --> 8336.659000000001
know I mean and some people break with

8334.139 --> 8339.598999999998
this information as though it's like you

8336.659 --> 8343.92
know like threatening to them personally

8339.599 --> 8345.869
and you know everyone has to come to any

8343.92 --> 8348.059
of this these thoughts it's like you

8345.869 --> 8350.42
know it's like I look at it like you

8348.059 --> 8353.309
know hey did Columbus discover America

8350.42 --> 8354.929
right you know I mean like you know did

8353.309 --> 8357.239
Columbus discover America well in hi see

8354.929 --> 8359.579
you know in great you know in a

8357.239 --> 8361.948999999999
kindergarten and that reign of area

8359.579 --> 8364.519
you're damn right Christopher Columbus

8361.949 --> 8369.869
[ __ ] saved America you know

8364.519 --> 8371.880000000001
discovered America right well it's being

8369.869 --> 8372.899000000001
drawn in doubt currently so we don't

8371.88 --> 8375.268999999998
know for how long

8372.899 --> 8377.399
if you ask a freaking like kindergarten

8375.269 --> 8379.5
we're gonna take Christopher chances are

8377.399 --> 8381.448999999999
Christopher Columbus discovered America

8379.5 --> 8383.849
right at least in my generation that's

8381.449 --> 8385.889000000001
what we learned and I'm just trying to

8383.849 --> 8388.17
say that for some people you know I

8385.889 --> 8389.339999999998
think you know and then as you get older

8388.17 --> 8390.81
when you get into college you realize

8389.34 --> 8392.130000000001
well well there was actually populations

8390.81 --> 8394.649
here he actually did this that the other

8392.13 --> 8397.5
thing it wasn't to his grant too poetic

8394.649 --> 8400.56
as they led me to believe but like you

8397.5 --> 8402.3
know I you know there there's this same

8400.56 --> 8405.96
thing with the shape of the earth and

8402.3 --> 8408.14
all of these things and it's just

8405.96 --> 8408.14
fascinating

8408.72 --> 8413.46
because it's like it's like fighting for

8411.359 --> 8416.37
like the ballers are like fighting for

8413.46 --> 8419.339999999998
the the you know Christopher Columbus

8416.37 --> 8421.050000000001
discovered America you know I mean and

8419.34 --> 8423.149
they have some grounds because maybe you

8421.05 --> 8424.8
discovered America for the Europeans or

8423.149 --> 8427.108999999999
discovered America for that particular

8424.8 --> 8430.739
group but it doesn't make it essentially

8427.109 --> 8431.609
you know objectively true mmhmm yeah

8430.739 --> 8434.52
that's a good point

8431.609 --> 8436.83
definitely and I don't think he even did

8434.52 --> 8439.08
that really well I'm just trying to say

8436.83 --> 8441.539999999999
it's like I like what but what what

8439.08 --> 8444.42
people think is more reality sometimes

8441.54 --> 8446.550000000001
the discovery of America was not as much

8444.42 --> 8450.029
a discovery as it was basically

8446.55 --> 8452.31
ambitious plans from European royalty to

8450.029 --> 8455.220000000001
start colonizing the world I just

8452.31 --> 8457.68
claimed and nobody was there well yeah I

8455.22 --> 8459.688999999998
mean I have an interesting little theory

8457.68 --> 8462.6
on that stuff in the sense that you know

8459.689 --> 8464.880000000001
that's why you know think of it like

8462.6 --> 8467.399000000001
this like the missionaries went out to

8464.88 --> 8469.739
serve the Lord right mm-hmm

8467.399 --> 8471.119999999999
so it's like you know well served is

8469.739 --> 8474.96
like you know when you go to court you

8471.12 --> 8477.87
get served right hmm so like you know so

8474.96 --> 8479.91
they were serving the Lord's word saying

8477.87 --> 8483.390000000001
hey either you accept Jesus or we can

8479.91 --> 8485.609
come I'm gonna get you and most people

8483.39 --> 8488.16
didn't either accepted Jesus and

8485.609 --> 8490.59
whatever or [ __ ] didn't and it was a

8488.16 --> 8493.59
rejection of the offer therefore it was

8490.59 --> 8495.210000000001
a violation of contract law and by the

8493.59 --> 8497.72
law of conquest that's how the Vatican

8495.21 --> 8502.858999999999
and all these institutions were able to

8497.72 --> 8505.56
expect because and legally so it made it

8502.859 --> 8507.18
contractually legit because somebody

8505.56 --> 8510.83
rejected the offer you know there's a

8507.18 --> 8514.26
maxim you know he who does deny admits

8510.83 --> 8517.56
what you know so he who does deny admits

8514.26 --> 8519.51
so it's like you know I got at least

8517.56 --> 8521.189
I've learned as a maxim and I kind of

8519.51 --> 8523.08
recognized as such that's why I had a

8521.189 --> 8526.229000000001
problem with certain people do the you

8523.08 --> 8528.3
know I do not consent well you know by

8526.229 --> 8530.099999999999
denying you consent it's like you know

8528.3 --> 8532.17
when was the last time a kid in the

8530.1 --> 8534.029
candy store who was asked did you steal

8532.17 --> 8538.43
that and put it in your pocket and the

8534.029 --> 8538.43
kid said no was he taken seriously

8539.99 --> 8545.55
right or let's say you know cop wants to

8543.899 --> 8549.858999999999
search your car you go goes can I search

8545.55 --> 8549.858999999999
the car you go no how does that end up

8550.58 --> 8555.479
usually them trying to force you to do

8553.2 --> 8558.569000000001
that yeah so my point is that he who

8555.479 --> 8560.13
does deny admits so like you know

8558.569 --> 8564.21
there's the and but you always have the

8560.13 --> 8568.83
unlimited right to contract which is the

8564.21 --> 8570.24
counter offer which is the idea that hey

8568.83 --> 8572.789999999999
I'd love to so long as you can show me

8570.24 --> 8574.319
you wouldn't be depriving my my you know

8572.79 --> 8575.51
depriving me of equal protection and due

8574.319 --> 8579.51
process of law

8575.51 --> 8580.95
like understand I like that so long as

8579.51 --> 8582.18
you accept that you know so long as you

8580.95 --> 8587.16
accept that when we get to court it's

8582.18 --> 8590.279
gonna be dismissed hmm that's

8587.16 --> 8592.71
interesting yeah I I that's a it's a

8590.279 --> 8595.37
technicality about basically

8592.71 --> 8598.649
representing yourself on the spot live

8595.37 --> 8600.960000000001
no it is it kind of is and you want a

8598.649 --> 8602.939
good point like if you just say no that

8600.96 --> 8605.25
doesn't work but if you address it in

8602.939 --> 8609.42
the right way you could effectively say

8605.25 --> 8610.8
no but you have to do it right well says

8609.42 --> 8613.319
here you know eat this [ __ ] sandwich

8610.8 --> 8615.539999999999
it's like sure I'd love to so long as

8613.319 --> 8621.109
you eat half and you give me ten million

8615.54 --> 8630.140000000001
dollars and you gotta eat it first

8621.109 --> 8635.16
hmm okay interesting way of reasoning

8630.14 --> 8636.18
I'll think about it yeah you know it's

8635.16 --> 8638.1
kind of what I've been talking about

8636.18 --> 8643.979000000001
since the first day I came to [ __ ] out

8638.1 --> 8649.01
here man party language I know yeah shut

8643.979 --> 8649.01
up the judge skeptic got there yeah

8650.16 --> 8656.05
but yeah yeah he's I you know he's a

8653.35 --> 8656.649000000001
he's a salty freaking Scotsman yeah you

8656.05 --> 8660.16
want bro

8656.649 --> 8661.539999999999
you know like set out to the sulky Scots

8660.16 --> 8667.78
is out there you're not saying I got no

8661.54 --> 8669.45
beef with them sit yeah yeah I think but

8667.78 --> 8671.439
you know but that's what makes it uh

8669.45 --> 8675.210000000001
that's what makes it interesting to me

8671.439 --> 8676.87
and like you know in light of that idea

8675.21 --> 8678.58
you know and I've had certain

8676.87 --> 8681.79
experiences where I've had to you know

8678.58 --> 8683.8
I've just I've you know use this and I

8681.79 --> 8685.54
feel like you know just when we

8683.8 --> 8687.88
understand the etiquette and the nature

8685.54 --> 8690.939
of the way our society I think is truly

8687.88 --> 8693.938999999998
driven that they get benefits us and we

8690.939 --> 8695.800000000001
don't it's counterintuitive again this

8693.939 --> 8697.87
comes to the counterintuitive part of

8695.8 --> 8699.429999999998
the thing in the garden and the idea of

8697.87 --> 8702.310000000001
like you know it's it's what's

8699.43 --> 8705.460000000001
counterintuitive what's right and it's

8702.31 --> 8709.42
what is desired it's like you know it's

8705.46 --> 8714.07
like you know I love the line rest in

8709.42 --> 8717.07
reason and move and passion you know

8714.07 --> 8718.949999999999
yeah yeah that's a good one you know

8717.07 --> 8722.949999999999
like you know but when you move move and

8718.95 --> 8727.93
like you know I know you know it's like

8722.95 --> 8729.640000000001
even like I don't know it's like it's

8727.93 --> 8731.56
like a it's like a it's like a dog

8729.64 --> 8732.88
jumping on the table or something and

8731.56 --> 8734.859
knocking it every knocking everything

8732.88 --> 8737.82
off of it people still being like oh

8734.859 --> 8737.82
it's just adorable

8740.1 --> 8746.62
it's that's I don't know man that's the

8742.99 --> 8750.49
way it's got to be you know I mean it's

8746.62 --> 8753.640000000001
like I just that's how I see it that's

8750.49 --> 8755.92
like I think it's cool but you know with

8753.64 --> 8760.33
any of these ideas it's no strategical

8755.92 --> 8762.88
rejection you could call it yeah it's

8760.33 --> 8763.93
it's just yeah yeah I guess you could

8762.88 --> 8766.72
say it but I don't even like the

8763.93 --> 8768.880000000001
rejection cuz I've kind of I don't like

8766.72 --> 8770.949999999999
the end any idea of the negative I want

8768.88 --> 8772.0
everything to be in a positive flow it's

8770.95 --> 8774.220000000001
like yeah I'd love to

8772.0 --> 8776.64
so long you don't have to call that to

8774.22 --> 8779.649
their faces right just a description

8776.64 --> 8782.43
right fair enough I just I say it too

8779.649 --> 8785.55
because it's really to do with this

8782.43 --> 8787.319
of thinking and as we like as we take

8785.55 --> 8790.8
you know you can't define yourself by

8787.319 --> 8793.35
what you hate and what you're not that's

8790.8 --> 8795.708999999999
right so and if you do that then you

8793.35 --> 8798.09
wind up in this like comparison mode and

8795.709 --> 8800.789
like you know whatever this and like you

8798.09 --> 8802.949
know and I think that's when you know

8800.789 --> 8805.789
that's why it's like you know being your

8802.949 --> 8808.709
own little messed up you and to join it

8805.789 --> 8811.319000000001
that's how I can join the individual

8808.709 --> 8814.289
nature and things and like I said the

8811.319 --> 8816.749
objective reality that we live we all

8814.289 --> 8818.909000000001
experience the world subjectively now

8816.749 --> 8821.55
some people take that to the sociopathic

8818.909 --> 8824.22
point of view we're like oh if I walk

8821.55 --> 8825.599999999999
out of that room nothing exists right

8824.22 --> 8827.669
uniting me like you know I think that's

8825.6 --> 8828.899000000001
almost sociopathic that's how I feel

8827.669 --> 8830.34
with people sometimes cuz they don't

8828.899 --> 8832.649
think anything exists outside of their

8830.34 --> 8835.02
own head but they're like you said all

8832.649 --> 8837.958999999999
my days now but then don't think that

8835.02 --> 8842.029
they just don't let it have consequences

8837.959 --> 8847.26
to them so they act as if there weren't

8842.029 --> 8849.18
doesn't matter to them well I mean yeah

8847.26 --> 8852.93
they don't hate you you believe nothing

8849.18 --> 8855.6
is exists outside of that moment so that

8852.93 --> 8858.119
yeah man I get what you mean right yeah

8855.6 --> 8860.1
you know and I think well I mean some

8858.119 --> 8861.659000000001
you know that's where it could go all

8860.1 --> 8863.729000000001
the way to the sociopathic point of view

8861.659 --> 8864.689
where they really do and that's what I'm

8863.729 --> 8866.698999999999
just trying to say it's like and that's

8864.689 --> 8869.729000000001
what I think you have this you know

8866.699 --> 8871.169
that's where evil and me on some things

8869.729 --> 8873.479
like that resides because it doesn't

8871.169 --> 8875.399
have it doesn't no empathy and you know

8873.479 --> 8878.01
I mean I think when we eliminate that

8875.399 --> 8880.169
from our world and that's what also this

8878.01 --> 8884.249
technological world could potentially do

8880.169 --> 8886.079
is isolate us to the point of of uh you

8884.249 --> 8888.899
know no empathy because here it doesn't

8886.079 --> 8891.63
matter it it's not you and like you know

8888.899 --> 8894.899
and it's then you are also in social

8891.63 --> 8897.778999999999
dealings it's very useful if it's

8894.899 --> 8900.269999999999
possible to basically really when you're

8897.779 --> 8903.810000000001
confronted with somebody try to figure

8900.27 --> 8906.239
out who they are as a person and why

8903.81 --> 8907.8
their stance is the way it is and if you

8906.239 --> 8910.05
start to feel that out and get it then

8907.8 --> 8913.499
you can actually connect with them much

8910.05 --> 8915.24
better instead of basically not

8913.499 --> 8921.96
personifying them

8915.24 --> 8926.55
and yeah responding to a tag or a

8921.96 --> 8931.949999999999
concept which does not give a lot of

8926.55 --> 8935.789999999999
attachment for empathy so basically

8931.95 --> 8939.36
saying the same thing yeah yeah but I

8935.79 --> 8942.330000000002
think as we you know in not you know

8939.36 --> 8945.479000000001
you're kind of in that mud modernity or

8942.33 --> 8947.19
among her you know in that mundane

8945.479 --> 8948.57
environment is like that's where you

8947.19 --> 8951.18
have to you know that's where I said

8948.57 --> 8953.01
it's like the dog on the table you know

8951.18 --> 8956.58
any because it's like that like in that

8953.01 --> 8959.28
mundane environment you know it's like

8956.58 --> 8960.57
be that well yeah you know like you know

8959.28 --> 8962.52
think that kind of I don't know I think

8960.57 --> 8965.58
well if you can find somebody's

8962.52 --> 8968.460000000001
personality then you can also find what

8965.58 --> 8971.09
they like and then work yourself towards

8968.46 --> 8974.729
that so that is technically what that is

8971.09 --> 8978.02
yeah you know and also be abused by the

8974.729 --> 8980.729
way but that's right help I could get

8978.02 --> 8982.32
right now I'm joking I'm selling it out

8980.729 --> 8987.9
I should pretty good pretty much good
