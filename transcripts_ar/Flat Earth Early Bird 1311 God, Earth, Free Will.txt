143.12 --> 145.28
bit

145.599 --> 149.35999999999999
it hasn't really been raining anymore

150.239 --> 153.44
stopped last night

153.68 --> 157.59900000000002
and yeah it's

155.36 --> 162.48000000000002
a little wind

157.599 --> 162.48
with like a bit of cloudiness but still

162.959 --> 168.08
some sun in between all it

165.519 --> 170.48000000000002
but yeah it's it it definitely warmed

168.08 --> 174.28
back up again a bit

170.48 --> 174.28
let me check the temperature

185.12 --> 190.0
hello psych bear first in chat good to

187.68 --> 190.0
see you

190.4 --> 197.0
it is friday the 22nd of july 2022

202.959 --> 206.48
yeah

204.0 --> 208.879
temperature is 21 degrees celsius right

206.48 --> 212.35999999999999
now over here

208.879 --> 212.35999999999999
so yeah

213.84 --> 216.879
pretty good temperature

220.799 --> 226.0
supposedly it's gonna get warmer again

223.44 --> 227.84
especially this sunday where it says 29

226.0 --> 231.08
degrees so

227.84 --> 231.08
we'll see

246.4 --> 251.76000000000002
got some green tea although it is a

248.72 --> 253.92
little hot i also have some

251.76 --> 257.519
bottled water with cooling element

253.92 --> 257.519
around it just awesome

260.31 --> 263.509
[Music]

266.24 --> 269.24
ah

272.39 --> 282.74
[Music]

289.6 --> 291.759
right

290.639 --> 294.08
anyway

291.759 --> 296.32
yeah yesterday's early bird show was

294.08 --> 299.75899999999996
interesting or at least second half

296.32 --> 302.0
first half i was tired

299.759 --> 304.47900000000004
i feel a little bit like that too but

302.0 --> 307.52
hopefully it won't last too long low

304.479 --> 307.52
territ 306

307.759 --> 312.72
flat earth debates was really good and

310.24 --> 314.08
intense but i i

312.72 --> 316.56
barely

314.08 --> 319.75899999999996
said a word in it

316.56 --> 321.52
everybody was rowdy and

319.759 --> 323.52000000000004
i just didn't want to be a target of

321.52 --> 328.0
that i tried to get in there at some

323.52 --> 328.0
point it just everybody just ignored me

336.24 --> 344.199
but that's all fine

339.44 --> 344.199
i kind of wanted to take it easy anyway

352.56 --> 356.32
right also yeah weird

358.16 --> 361.03900000000004
announcement from jazz in the disbarry

360.0 --> 364.0
family

361.039 --> 366.479
that the tour is already discontinued i

364.0 --> 369.039
i watched that video but i didn't really

366.479 --> 372.0
understand

369.039 --> 374.24
what the reason was

372.0 --> 376.56
it's probably financial related that's

374.24 --> 381.0
what happened the last time

376.56 --> 381.0
seems to be a reoccurring issue

381.36 --> 383.52000000000004
but

383.84 --> 387.039
yeah that was cut short

389.52 --> 393.35999999999996
i mean if it's because of the weather

391.199 --> 394.96000000000004
then that wouldn't really make all that

393.36 --> 396.88
much sense since

394.96 --> 398.4
weather's just going up and down and up

396.88 --> 401.919
and down i mean

398.4 --> 401.919
shouldn't be too problematic

402.319 --> 405.36
but whatever

406.4 --> 409.4
ah

412.4 --> 416.88
and yeah it's too bad though because it

414.4 --> 421.479
was really it it was kind of interesting

416.88 --> 421.479
right it's a leather street activism

424.0 --> 429.16
which is like very different from what i

426.16 --> 429.16
do

440.72 --> 443.72
uh

462.96 --> 467.52
oh

464.879 --> 470.8
okay tara you got a cool day today in

467.52 --> 470.79999999999995
india that's nice for you

471.52 --> 476.599
yeah 12 degrees that's colder than it's

473.599 --> 476.599
here

480.16 --> 489.68
is jim panda mctoon's future what

484.639 --> 491.599
you mean gem panda wait with g-e-m

489.68 --> 495.039
is that who you mean

491.599 --> 495.039
is that my future

496.319 --> 498.879
i don't know

499.759 --> 505.47900000000004
i think mctoon's just gonna keep doing

502.08 --> 505.479
what he's doing

507.68 --> 512.88
i mean jem panda like had to retreat but

509.919 --> 514.4789999999999
that's because dude gem has like one of

512.88 --> 516.719
the worst

514.479 --> 518.719
discord personalities that have ever

516.719 --> 520.8000000000001
come across like

518.719 --> 523.279
really

520.8 --> 526.88
heavy heavy gamma

523.279 --> 526.88
unbearable character so

527.12 --> 530.9590000000001
mactune is not like that

532.72 --> 538.1600000000001
so i doubt he's going to become like the

534.959 --> 538.16
next gem panda

545.839 --> 549.9200000000001
what vladimir sage told me to go to

548.08 --> 550.9590000000001
cashmere

549.92 --> 553.959
uh

550.959 --> 553.959
okay

558.02 --> 562.37
[Music]

563.6 --> 566.6
hmm

568.21 --> 571.259
[Music]

592.16 --> 598.88
right don't forget to visit my twitter

596.16 --> 598.88
page and

599.92 --> 603.88
follow and say hello

605.2 --> 611.0400000000001
i'm mostly just linking my streams

608.959 --> 612.4799999999999
but uh yeah

611.04 --> 615.36
i will be

612.48 --> 617.519
up and down back on there just browsing

615.36 --> 619.36
around looking around and

617.519 --> 623.48
sharing stuff and

619.36 --> 623.48
saying things also

637.68 --> 640.68
foreign

652.32 --> 657.519
yeah the title is another

655.519 --> 659.839
another three

657.519 --> 661.76
another trinity it's it's weird like

659.839 --> 665.2
rock paper scissor

661.76 --> 667.6
is really like a trinity system

665.2 --> 667.6
although

668.959 --> 674.92
yeah

670.48 --> 674.9200000000001
and it's applicable to many things

701.76 --> 706.079
flight

703.44 --> 707.839
wait you're on a plane turret or you

706.079 --> 712.4399999999999
went

707.839 --> 712.44
on a plane to cashmere or something

763.2 --> 766.8000000000001
hmm

764.72 --> 769.0400000000001
all right all right turret

766.8 --> 769.04
cool

769.2 --> 773.839
hello crockett good to see you

840.839 --> 845.12
okay

842.48 --> 848.16
checked out owen benjamin

845.12 --> 848.16
completely forgot

854.16 --> 858.3199999999999
i'll have some catching up to do this

855.92 --> 858.3199999999999
weekend

868.72 --> 872.399
hey clutch good to see you

880.079 --> 884.6389999999999
what clutch and what are you talking

881.76 --> 887.12
about

884.639 --> 888.32
is this like a random joke or you

887.12 --> 892.44
actually

888.32 --> 892.44
are trying to reference something

906.42 --> 909.99
[Music]

911.279 --> 914.72
it was repossessed

915.04 --> 918.4399999999999
it's just terrible

922.61 --> 929.52
[Music]

967.44 --> 969.839
take some

970.0 --> 973.839
deep breaths of fresh air

972.399 --> 976.839
i'm feeling kind of slow this is

973.839 --> 976.839
annoying

1027.36 --> 1030.079
sorry about that

1031.199 --> 1037.199
asus yes

1033.839 --> 1039.839
you jeff gas head

1037.199 --> 1039.8390000000002
huh

1060.88 --> 1067.7990000000002
how am i doing i'm okay i'm just a

1063.679 --> 1067.799
little bit slow i guess

1070.799 --> 1074.16
this is yeah

1072.96 --> 1077.039
like

1074.16 --> 1079.44
usually like by the evening i get very

1077.039 --> 1082.0
active though

1079.44 --> 1084.24
compared to now it's just that

1082.0 --> 1085.84
last few days it just like really slowed

1084.24 --> 1087.84
down right when i should start the show

1085.84 --> 1091.1999999999998
which is weird because i'm really kind

1087.84 --> 1091.1999999999998
of active before that

1093.44 --> 1099.44
but it's also because just i don't know

1095.76 --> 1100.8799999999999
my fractal thinking in my dream walking

1099.44 --> 1104.88
it's

1100.88 --> 1107.1200000000001
like yielding a lot of universals

1104.88 --> 1109.8400000000001
universals right

1107.12 --> 1109.84
it's just that

1110.4 --> 1115.76
that's not really super useful like when

1112.96 --> 1118.0
i do a live show

1115.76 --> 1121.2
it's great for my own oversight but you

1118.0 --> 1122.64
just can't really make points with it

1121.2 --> 1125.2
because

1122.64 --> 1127.039
it's like it wouldn't be cohesive enough

1125.2 --> 1128.48
and don't want to go there wait i could

1127.039 --> 1130.8799999999999
reference

1128.48 --> 1133.1200000000001
yesterday uh somebody linked me up to a

1130.88 --> 1133.1200000000001
show

1134.16 --> 1138.0800000000002
it was matthew hall

1140.32 --> 1143.36
i tried to watch that

1142.16 --> 1144.88
but

1143.36 --> 1146.9599999999998
i just couldn't

1144.88 --> 1150.24
like i can't believe he actually watched

1146.96 --> 1153.1200000000001
half of that

1150.24 --> 1156.48
it was just annoying

1153.12 --> 1156.4799999999998
i mean is that just me

1160.24 --> 1164.08
i didn't like it

1161.919 --> 1165.8400000000001
i thought it was just geomatria

1164.08 --> 1168.08
squirting

1165.84 --> 1170.72
like there was no cohesion in like the

1168.08 --> 1172.559
geomatria oversight really it's just a

1170.72 --> 1174.24
bunch of word links they found these

1172.559 --> 1176.799
connections and they were just like

1174.24 --> 1178.32
legoing around with their geomatria

1176.799 --> 1180.559
connections

1178.32 --> 1182.6399999999999
and technically it didn't mean anything

1180.559 --> 1185.84
nor did it prove anything nor did it

1182.64 --> 1186.88
give them a brilliant insight of any

1185.84 --> 1191.32
sort

1186.88 --> 1191.3200000000002
it was just a complete waste of time

1192.08 --> 1195.52
of like

1193.28 --> 1197.2
sometimes when i start my show and i

1195.52 --> 1198.96
don't talk for like

1197.2 --> 1201.28
15 minutes

1198.96 --> 1203.8400000000001
that is also kind of a waste of time but

1201.28 --> 1206.8799999999999
the thing is

1203.84 --> 1209.4399999999998
i don't make that the show

1206.88 --> 1212.0
i just have those parts

1209.44 --> 1213.919
and then as soon as i can i like pull

1212.0 --> 1216.159
out of it and become active again like

1213.919 --> 1218.0
right now for some reason i guess with

1216.159 --> 1220.24
me

1218.0 --> 1222.159
everything

1220.24 --> 1224.48
i'm gonna be attacking something or

1222.159 --> 1227.0390000000002
criticizing something that does like

1224.48 --> 1228.72
really wake me up

1227.039 --> 1230.799
it's weird

1228.72 --> 1232.64
i also noticed it yesterday when i went

1230.799 --> 1235.76
after that new guy

1232.64 --> 1238.0
that didn't know that nukes were fake

1235.76 --> 1241.36
i thought it was a like a troll and then

1238.0 --> 1244.159
i like ran after him and he wasn't so i

1241.36 --> 1246.32
corrected myself but it was still awake

1244.159 --> 1249.2
now i'm reminded of that show i was

1246.32 --> 1251.2
linked to and i realized yeah there's

1249.2 --> 1253.3600000000001
really very little good i can say about

1251.2 --> 1253.3600000000001
it

1253.52 --> 1258.1589999999999
but since if people are gonna bring up

1256.159 --> 1260.88
shows to me

1258.159 --> 1262.96
then i will judge it

1260.88 --> 1264.96
on an irwinian level doesn't mean that

1262.96 --> 1267.919
you you're not allowed to like it

1264.96 --> 1269.8400000000001
anymore look if you like that fine

1267.919 --> 1272.0
not criticizing you

1269.84 --> 1273.039
sometimes i wonder why some people like

1272.0 --> 1274.32
my show

1273.039 --> 1278.48
really

1274.32 --> 1278.48
but i will be honest about it

1279.84 --> 1287.9189999999999
yeah the lc king thing that's right

1282.48 --> 1287.919
it was sorry it was such a waste of time

1288.32 --> 1294.1589999999999
very hard to follow because there was no

1291.12 --> 1297.52
cohesion susie

1294.159 --> 1297.5200000000002
there was nothing to follow

1300.32 --> 1304.3999999999999
like

1301.84 --> 1307.039
they look if you're going to

1304.4 --> 1308.72
try to like insert fractal thinking

1307.039 --> 1312.559
patterns right that can resonate with

1308.72 --> 1314.559
other people you got to have cohesion

1312.559 --> 1316.96
you can't just say oh this links to that

1314.559 --> 1320.1589999999999
oh and that links to that that does not

1316.96 --> 1321.28
mean cohesion that's just the link

1320.159 --> 1324.64
now if

1321.28 --> 1328.1589999999999
some really important maneuver or change

1324.64 --> 1330.48
or pattern is discovered in a way

1328.159 --> 1332.5590000000002
through the geomatria that's kind of

1330.48 --> 1334.72
interesting but then you must step away

1332.559 --> 1337.52
from the geomatria and focus on the

1334.72 --> 1340.159
discovery and that can be

1337.52 --> 1340.1589999999999
applied

1340.72 --> 1346.159
this is what i do have you noticed like

1343.919 --> 1347.8400000000001
yeah i do see patterns i just don't

1346.159 --> 1349.679
dwell on them i i

1347.84 --> 1350.9599999999998
see something i discover something i see

1349.679 --> 1354.3200000000002
a pattern and like

1350.96 --> 1357.1200000000001
wow the pattern no not the freaking code

1354.32 --> 1359.9189999999999
gematra thing or whatever that i use to

1357.12 --> 1361.6789999999999
write to derive that from but the

1359.919 --> 1363.679
discovery itself

1361.679 --> 1366.5590000000002
the idea the inside

1363.679 --> 1369.2800000000002
that's the valuable thing not the stupid

1366.559 --> 1369.28
puzzle book

1372.88 --> 1375.8400000000001
anyway

1379.84 --> 1384.48
dealing with life

1381.84 --> 1384.48
off ground

1386.96 --> 1391.28
okay having a hard time clutch that

1388.88 --> 1391.2800000000002
sucks

1394.08 --> 1399.52
you being honest yourself and honest is

1396.64 --> 1399.5200000000002
why people like you

1401.2 --> 1405.1200000000001
that's a funny way of saying that i

1403.12 --> 1405.84
could also interpret that

1405.12 --> 1408.559
like

1405.84 --> 1412.0
yeah you are [ __ ] annoying

1408.559 --> 1414.799
and you have weird behavioral traits

1412.0 --> 1418.0
but at least you're honest and that kind

1414.799 --> 1419.52
of makes it alright this is

1418.0 --> 1421.919
sorry

1419.52 --> 1423.039
i appreciate it

1421.919 --> 1426.48
but yes

1423.039 --> 1426.48
my honesty is like

1426.64 --> 1430.3600000000001
holy to me

1443.2 --> 1446.559
oh you're doing good

1445.6 --> 1449.76
okay that's

1446.559 --> 1449.76
like bear it's good to

1456.84 --> 1463.36
hear can always be sunshine and rainbows

1461.039 --> 1465.84
no that yeah good i'm

1463.36 --> 1467.84
good of you to recognize that right yeah

1465.84 --> 1471.1999999999998
we all have

1467.84 --> 1473.76
days where it's just like i don't

1471.2 --> 1476.8400000000001
yeah where the dark side just start

1473.76 --> 1479.91
weighing on you and draining you get it

1476.84 --> 1479.9099999999999
[Music]

1481.44 --> 1484.8
there's like really messed up things

1483.52 --> 1488.6399999999999
happening

1484.8 --> 1491.279
[Music]

1488.64 --> 1493.039
europe is like doing really bad right

1491.279 --> 1494.799
now

1493.039 --> 1497.52
there's like an imminent disaster

1494.799 --> 1498.84
looming it's scary

1497.52 --> 1501.36
and like

1498.84 --> 1503.9189999999999
people in the alternative news sector

1501.36 --> 1504.9599999999998
are like reporting in on it and it's

1503.919 --> 1507.5200000000002
almost

1504.96 --> 1512.1200000000001
like almost panic like this is

1507.52 --> 1512.12
this could get really [ __ ] up

1514.24 --> 1518.32
i mean like it seems like the euro is

1516.799 --> 1520.799
suddenly

1518.32 --> 1524.3999999999999
like accelerating into a

1520.799 --> 1526.799
destabilization downfall

1524.4 --> 1529.799
and that would have pretty devastating

1526.799 --> 1529.799
consequences

1530.0 --> 1534.88
and i don't even understand it because

1531.76 --> 1536.799
i'm not like a financial guy

1534.88 --> 1538.96
but

1536.799 --> 1540.799
yeah

1538.96 --> 1543.1200000000001
there's people that are

1540.799 --> 1545.44
and they are like

1543.12 --> 1547.52
they're like trying to max kaiser it as

1545.44 --> 1550.72
i would call it i used to follow max

1547.52 --> 1552.4
keiser like in 2010 around that time

1550.72 --> 1554.08
when he was also on the alex jones show

1552.4 --> 1558.799
and he did a lot of like

1554.08 --> 1558.799
financial predicting on a higher level

1559.44 --> 1563.44
and that was i did learn a lot like

1561.679 --> 1565.919
about how the movements work and all

1563.44 --> 1568.72
that it's just that i will never be an

1565.919 --> 1568.72
expert at that

1569.36 --> 1572.9599999999998
it seems like europe is

1573.12 --> 1577.7199999999998
in a very bad place right now

1592.0 --> 1594.32
right

1594.48 --> 1600.88
and there seems signs even that like

1598.72 --> 1603.44
our government at least or europe it's

1600.88 --> 1606.24
not entirely clear might even get to the

1603.44 --> 1608.159
point where they will literally

1606.24 --> 1612.32
just start to

1608.159 --> 1613.679
dictate how we can spend our own money

1612.32 --> 1614.96
which is

1613.679 --> 1618.159
slavery

1614.96 --> 1622.72
that certainly makes everybody

1618.159 --> 1622.72
a slave like a plantation system

1623.679 --> 1627.24
totally absurd

1633.679 --> 1639.4
anyway i

1635.039 --> 1639.4
hope it's just kinda hype

1645.36 --> 1648.36
um

1659.44 --> 1665.3600000000001
oh hello guys thank you

1663.279 --> 1667.52
i bring up interesting topics i do my

1665.36 --> 1670.4799999999998
best

1667.52 --> 1673.279
i know i'm not the most

1670.48 --> 1676.0
fluent show out there

1673.279 --> 1677.919
it's just silent i'd like that i don't

1676.0 --> 1679.36
know how other people do it guys i don't

1677.919 --> 1680.72
know how they do it

1679.36 --> 1683.4399999999998
well maybe it's

1680.72 --> 1685.44
i think they keep going by just having a

1683.44 --> 1686.72
group of people

1685.44 --> 1688.559
but

1686.72 --> 1693.0
i'm not gonna do that

1688.559 --> 1693.0
i'm gonna do that on my own show

1700.32 --> 1705.039
and yeah i do come up with just

1702.399 --> 1708.1589999999999
interesting ideas because you know why

1705.039 --> 1711.919
it is because there are so many like

1708.159 --> 1715.3600000000001
universal movements like of like even

1711.919 --> 1717.6000000000001
business and agriculture or

1715.36 --> 1721.1999999999998
financial system or building right

1717.6 --> 1723.6
building buildings and the energy use

1721.2 --> 1724.559
and people are just like trying to get

1723.6 --> 1725.279
it

1724.559 --> 1728.08
but

1725.279 --> 1730.32
while everybody can roughly focus on

1728.08 --> 1732.48
understanding that and i do talk about a

1730.32 --> 1734.8799999999999
lot of those things

1732.48 --> 1737.679
that like bigger planning and now i

1734.88 --> 1740.5590000000002
don't do that but i do think about it a

1737.679 --> 1742.24
lot and i do take it very serious like i

1740.559 --> 1744.48
wish to basically

1742.24 --> 1746.0
assist people that do that to do it

1744.48 --> 1748.559
better

1746.0 --> 1751.44
i'm hoping somehow my ideas will slip

1748.559 --> 1753.279
through to them to the ones that could

1751.44 --> 1755.44
actually do it

1753.279 --> 1757.52
and then

1755.44 --> 1758.72
yeah you get the oversight and it's just

1757.52 --> 1761.44
for me

1758.72 --> 1763.44
like no i'm not going to like oh spend

1761.44 --> 1767.2
all my energy and focus on like trying

1763.44 --> 1770.0800000000002
to pad how it will work

1767.2 --> 1773.2
to like get optimal profits or some like

1770.08 --> 1776.1589999999999
i don't do that no for me it's just like

1773.2 --> 1778.0
how can i completely bypass

1776.159 --> 1780.0
some of these problems by doing

1778.0 --> 1782.08
something that just nobody has thought

1780.0 --> 1784.96
of before

1782.08 --> 1786.96
that's the thing that i like to do and

1784.96 --> 1788.72
i'm i've gotten pretty good at it i

1786.96 --> 1790.96
think

1788.72 --> 1795.24
it's just because it's not really that

1790.96 --> 1795.24
hard you just have to be

1796.08 --> 1800.1589999999999
in like

1797.279 --> 1803.039
yeah you have to be willing

1800.159 --> 1803.0390000000002
to bypass

1803.12 --> 1805.36
like

1805.6 --> 1810.799
the typical financial mindset of just

1808.0 --> 1813.039
like oh keep it how it is because then

1810.799 --> 1816.1589999999999
it's predictable and then you can b you

1813.039 --> 1818.64
could glaze it all

1816.159 --> 1820.64
for max max in profit right because if

1818.64 --> 1822.48
you want maximum profit you need to

1820.64 --> 1824.64
glaze it

1822.48 --> 1826.559
and then it needs to stay exactly as it

1824.64 --> 1829.039
is right so it's like the financial

1826.559 --> 1829.039
system

1830.64 --> 1836.48
but if you just break open

1833.84 --> 1840.1589999999999
rearrange everything change it into a

1836.48 --> 1840.159
completely different setup

1840.24 --> 1845.84
that's really what does change things

1843.6 --> 1849.1999999999998
for the better that's how

1845.84 --> 1850.559
technological advances are integrated

1849.2 --> 1852.88
with society

1850.559 --> 1853.6789999999999
through that approach

1852.88 --> 1855.679
and

1853.679 --> 1857.76
there's been people out there like

1855.679 --> 1860.3200000000002
industrialists even and business owners

1857.76 --> 1862.48
that do try to do that but it's also

1860.32 --> 1864.6399999999999
one-dimensional now everyone's just like

1862.48 --> 1867.519
oh we just needed

1864.64 --> 1869.519
more environmentally friendly but to an

1867.519 --> 1870.96
irrational level

1869.519 --> 1872.36
like

1870.96 --> 1875.76
a lot of

1872.36 --> 1879.84
environmentalist industrial developments

1875.76 --> 1879.84
have been quite irrational

1882.48 --> 1886.96
quite so

1884.08 --> 1888.96
and i'm like really angry

1886.96 --> 1891.679
about that

1888.96 --> 1893.279
there's so many so much better

1891.679 --> 1896.0800000000002
things

1893.279 --> 1896.08
that could have been

1902.799 --> 1905.799
right

1910.0 --> 1916.88
they are slowly closing down

1912.64 --> 1920.679
banks atms here jesus really

1916.88 --> 1920.679
what the hell why

1930.32 --> 1936.8799999999999
but that's absolutely insane

1934.48 --> 1938.159
i mean that could get out of hand really

1936.88 --> 1940.88
quickly

1938.159 --> 1942.72
i'm serious guys like to do that in an

1940.88 --> 1944.96
environment like that

1942.72 --> 1944.96
it

1946.24 --> 1951.76
that's literally just tur converting

1949.279 --> 1954.799
citizens overtly

1951.76 --> 1957.6
from free citizens

1954.799 --> 1960.32
into just cattle

1957.6 --> 1965.1999999999998
where suddenly organizations

1960.32 --> 1965.2
have full reign over what you do

1967.36 --> 1971.4399999999998
and

1968.08 --> 1971.4399999999998
people gonna accept that

1975.679 --> 1982.96
i mean guys how long is it gonna take

1978.72 --> 1982.96
before we finish them off

1984.159 --> 1989.3200000000002
like how much more pushing how much more

1986.32 --> 1989.32
pushiness

1996.32 --> 2000.48
we need to end

1998.399 --> 2003.6
their plan we need to end what they're

2000.48 --> 2005.919
doing they need to be faced face to face

2003.6 --> 2007.84
right they're all just keeping going

2005.919 --> 2010.3990000000001
under the false assumption

2007.84 --> 2012.8799999999999
that there's nothing we can do we can do

2010.399 --> 2012.8799999999999
something

2013.12 --> 2018.399
yeah more than peaceful demonstrating

2015.6 --> 2020.48
yeah we can actually do that

2018.399 --> 2024.08
like they've already broken the social

2020.48 --> 2025.919
contract i mean this is even widespread

2024.08 --> 2028.0
this is a widespread saying by now

2025.919 --> 2029.919
because it's true they have done that

2028.0 --> 2032.399
that has implications and those

2029.919 --> 2034.159
implications include

2032.399 --> 2035.6
that it is not

2034.159 --> 2038.0
barbaric

2035.6 --> 2043.36
to be violent

2038.0 --> 2043.36
in order to rectify this the situation

2043.84 --> 2050.96
like social contract breaking

2045.84 --> 2050.96
effectively is like a declaration of

2051.76 --> 2056.3990000000003
you know what of civil war

2054.399 --> 2058.3199999999997
that's effectively what that that what

2056.399 --> 2060.72
that does it's like a challenge like

2058.32 --> 2061.839
yeah we don't care anymore

2060.72 --> 2063.7599999999998
about

2061.839 --> 2067.119
our agreement what are you gonna do

2063.76 --> 2069.9190000000003
about it nothing okay thanks then we'll

2067.119 --> 2072.159
just take ownership over everything and

2069.919 --> 2073.52
now pen you in like cattle and treat you

2072.159 --> 2074.879
like slaves

2073.52 --> 2077.359
that's what that is that's what the

2074.879 --> 2079.5989999999997
breaking of a social contract is

2077.359 --> 2085.5989999999997
it is effectively

2079.599 --> 2085.599
a unspoken declaration of civil war

2086.399 --> 2091.359
it will never

2089.04 --> 2095.359
die down do you understand it's not

2091.359 --> 2098.7999999999997
going to stop until they're dead i i i'm

2095.359 --> 2100.3199999999997
sick of saying it i'm sick of saying it

2098.8 --> 2101.52
like this

2100.32 --> 2103.839
like this

2101.52 --> 2107.44
i'm sick of saying it i mean

2103.839 --> 2107.44
how many how long have i said it

2108.8 --> 2113.3590000000004
how long have i been saying this sort of

2110.64 --> 2116.72
thing to that level that declaration

2113.359 --> 2120.64
right like we have to kill them how many

2116.72 --> 2120.64
times do i have to keep saying this

2126.64 --> 2129.52
the society

2128.4 --> 2131.6800000000003
you knew

2129.52 --> 2133.839
is over

2131.68 --> 2135.68
you can't get it back

2133.839 --> 2138.48
before the people

2135.68 --> 2140.3999999999996
that cr are crashing it that are doing

2138.48 --> 2145.0
this are dead

2140.4 --> 2145.0
you understand they will not stop

2145.76 --> 2148.8
they're not going to stop

2149.44 --> 2151.68
right

2153.119 --> 2156.1600000000003
and

2155.119 --> 2158.48
right

2156.16 --> 2161.5989999999997
and there's a wider problem because of

2158.48 --> 2163.599
the globalism nature of it all

2161.599 --> 2166.96
because they're an organization there's

2163.599 --> 2168.8
a like guys this is an open criminal

2166.96 --> 2172.7200000000003
conspiracy

2168.8 --> 2175.8390000000004
with like a million people or more

2172.72 --> 2180.3199999999997
and on top of that just all these

2175.839 --> 2180.32
[ __ ] up insane mercenaries

2182.32 --> 2184.88
all the corrupted in

2184.079 --> 2187.92
yeah

2184.88 --> 2189.839
[ __ ] around it the entire system banking

2187.92 --> 2192.4
security

2189.839 --> 2192.4
all of it

2193.44 --> 2198.96
that are signing on to this

2196.32 --> 2201.92
it's a problem

2198.96 --> 2203.76
because like even if you like say for

2201.92 --> 2205.92
example here in the netherlands we

2203.76 --> 2207.92
managed to weed out these [ __ ] up

2205.92 --> 2210.8
political parties

2207.92 --> 2213.04
like the main one about this party is

2210.8 --> 2215.2000000000003
already doing really bad it's like

2213.04 --> 2218.16
literally

2215.2 --> 2219.7599999999998
like bleeding members now it's it's

2218.16 --> 2221.92
dying like

2219.76 --> 2224.7200000000003
like the internal party members are just

2221.92 --> 2226.8
sick of it like even they feel like

2224.72 --> 2228.3999999999996
screwed over now

2226.8 --> 2231.76
like they're starting to realize this is

2228.4 --> 2234.32
all garbage these are nazis these are

2231.76 --> 2236.8
like literal nazis

2234.32 --> 2238.88
that are just taking

2236.8 --> 2240.8
off their cloak and putting on their

2238.88 --> 2242.7200000000003
nazi uniform that's what they've become

2240.8 --> 2244.7200000000003
now and they're sick of it

2242.72 --> 2247.1189999999997
but you gotta realize that even if we

2244.72 --> 2248.3999999999996
manage to weed them out you know what

2247.119 --> 2249.92
they're gonna do

2248.4 --> 2251.839
they're just gonna

2249.92 --> 2254.7200000000003
move away

2251.839 --> 2258.24
to their little fortresses

2254.72 --> 2260.7999999999997
somewhere else to their safe countries

2258.24 --> 2263.2
where they got cover from some dictator

2260.8 --> 2265.28
that's gonna harbor them harbor them

2263.2 --> 2266.8799999999997
from persecution

2265.28 --> 2268.0
and then they're gonna

2266.88 --> 2268.8
like

2268.0 --> 2271.599
just

2268.8 --> 2274.0
leech all that data that they've been

2271.599 --> 2276.56
gathering and robbing from us and

2274.0 --> 2278.88
everything right and then they're gonna

2276.56 --> 2283.68
use other countries

2278.88 --> 2286.1600000000003
to start attacking us do you understand

2283.68 --> 2287.359
these politicians even if we if they we

2286.16 --> 2289.839
get them to the point where they're

2287.359 --> 2292.0
gonna flee the country

2289.839 --> 2293.52
they're gonna then from the other

2292.0 --> 2295.359
countries

2293.52 --> 2298.56
direct groups

2295.359 --> 2302.64
to attack us again right just like

2298.56 --> 2302.64
george soros does that all the time

2304.4 --> 2309.2000000000003
right he's not in the country but he

2306.4 --> 2310.96
just uses financial organizations and

2309.2 --> 2313.2799999999997
networks

2310.96 --> 2316.88
then just start attacking countries

2313.28 --> 2316.88
socially culturally

2317.359 --> 2321.5989999999997
financially

2318.56 --> 2324.0
right well these pieces of [ __ ] here in

2321.599 --> 2328.0
the government will do that too

2324.0 --> 2330.0
that's why i say [ __ ] your [ __ ]

2328.0 --> 2332.48
peaceful [ __ ]

2330.0 --> 2335.68
finish them off

2332.48 --> 2338.96
don't let them get away they will get

2335.68 --> 2342.24
away they will keep attacking us even if

2338.96 --> 2343.28
we supposedly get back control over the

2342.24 --> 2345.68
government

2343.28 --> 2349.52
then they will attack us from outside

2345.68 --> 2352.52
the government we need to finish them

2349.52 --> 2352.52
off

2360.16 --> 2367.3199999999997
i'm sick

2361.76 --> 2367.32
of saying this i'm sick of saying it

2368.24 --> 2370.3999999999996
when

2369.28 --> 2373.92
are

2370.4 --> 2377.119
the people in the world going to realize

2373.92 --> 2378.0
i'm right and that this stupid pre-tense

2377.119 --> 2380.7200000000003
game

2378.0 --> 2383.2
and hippy dippy [ __ ] about how we

2380.72 --> 2385.5989999999997
can finish it all peacefully oh yeah

2383.2 --> 2388.0
yeah yeah like a gandhi the fake

2385.599 --> 2389.44
freemason agent right

2388.0 --> 2391.68
or how about

2389.44 --> 2396.8
jesus christ

2391.68 --> 2399.359
the savior yeah oh oh did he did he win

2396.8 --> 2401.44
through his peaceful resistance no he

2399.359 --> 2403.2
got freaking crucified

2401.44 --> 2405.76
and then priests

2403.2 --> 2406.96
proceeded to make up [ __ ] about how

2405.76 --> 2408.3190000000004
his death

2406.96 --> 2410.88
supposedly

2408.319 --> 2412.72
changed everything oh did it no no it

2410.88 --> 2416.8
didn't

2412.72 --> 2419.68
yeah another example of how peacefully

2416.8 --> 2422.48
being peaceful the only thing it does is

2419.68 --> 2425.44
making you end up dead

2422.48 --> 2428.16
you understand against the devil

2425.44 --> 2430.079
the only thing you can actually do

2428.16 --> 2432.7999999999997
is war

2430.079 --> 2434.1600000000003
un repenting

2432.8 --> 2436.48
war

2434.16 --> 2438.8799999999997
you have to finish them off you have to

2436.48 --> 2441.76
quench the spirit you have to attack

2438.88 --> 2444.6400000000003
that spirit savagely

2441.76 --> 2447.6800000000003
because it's demon they are killers

2444.64 --> 2452.4
they're gonna destroy everything it will

2447.68 --> 2454.96
slowly quench the spirit of life itself

2452.4 --> 2458.0
if we don't finish them off

2454.96 --> 2460.079
like the evil satanic witches

2458.0 --> 2462.8
that they effectively are

2460.079 --> 2465.76
and they [ __ ] brag about it in their

2462.8 --> 2469.6800000000003
stupid little gatherings okay

2465.76 --> 2472.6400000000003
they are satanic witches they need to

2469.68 --> 2474.319
die they need to burn

2472.64 --> 2477.2
hurry up

2474.319 --> 2480.52
satan's coming

2477.2 --> 2480.52
get them

2492.28 --> 2495.9790000000003
[Music]

2498.51 --> 2503.0890000000004
[Music]

2512.079 --> 2517.6800000000003
right and that's the reason why i get a

2514.319 --> 2517.68
little slow sometimes

2517.839 --> 2522.0
because that's

2519.599 --> 2523.599
that's the level of frequency that's

2522.0 --> 2526.079
inside of me

2523.599 --> 2528.96
you can't really roll out just oh like

2526.079 --> 2530.96
nice light-hearted conversation

2528.96 --> 2535.2
oh this is going to work so well no no i

2530.96 --> 2540.0
got like real serious [ __ ]

2535.2 --> 2540.0
inside here that is extremely urgent

2540.88 --> 2545.76
i don't even know like how to transition

2543.359 --> 2548.72
all this right like where

2545.76 --> 2551.0400000000004
i i'm just doing this i'm doing this as

2548.72 --> 2554.56
the oracle

2551.04 --> 2558.0
i don't like how would you

2554.56 --> 2560.72
make what i do in the way that i talk

2558.0 --> 2563.68
how would you make that compatible

2560.72 --> 2566.16
right with what anybody else out there

2563.68 --> 2566.16
is doing

2571.52 --> 2578.079
like how could i work together with this

2574.24 --> 2580.3999999999996
right would other people feel safe

2578.079 --> 2583.8390000000004
to just go with me

2580.4 --> 2586.4
like verbally and really say like yes

2583.839 --> 2589.68
[ __ ] peaceful demonstrating

2586.4 --> 2592.079
this is war this is civil war we are

2589.68 --> 2593.44
being quenched to death we are slowly

2592.079 --> 2597.28
getting choked

2593.44 --> 2600.96
and the only way out is to

2597.28 --> 2602.8
actually take up arms and finish them

2600.96 --> 2606.64
off

2602.8 --> 2608.8
and keep fighting to the end like there

2606.64 --> 2611.44
is nothing else there's nothing else

2608.8 --> 2614.4
left but humiliation

2611.44 --> 2618.7200000000003
retardation dementia

2614.4 --> 2618.7200000000003
and a slow painful death

2618.8 --> 2624.7200000000003
with the spirit of absolute failure

2621.92 --> 2624.7200000000003
on top of that

2625.28 --> 2628.6400000000003
so what do you want to do

2627.2 --> 2631.1189999999997
what do you want to do with the rest of

2628.64 --> 2631.1189999999997
your life

2632.0 --> 2637.2
you want to be

2633.76 --> 2639.0400000000004
satan's cattle to be slowly tortured and

2637.2 --> 2642.24
grinded into meat

2639.04 --> 2646.56
for the devils to sniff up

2642.24 --> 2648.64
as you like noticeably degenerate not

2646.56 --> 2650.88
just because age but because of the

2648.64 --> 2653.1189999999997
poisons that you can't avoid

2650.88 --> 2654.88
and because of the psychological warfare

2653.119 --> 2657.04
that you're constantly being subjected

2654.88 --> 2661.04
to that is stressing you out another

2657.04 --> 2664.0
burden that you can't get rid of

2661.04 --> 2664.8
yeah you want to be that

2664.0 --> 2667.839
oh

2664.8 --> 2671.28
you could take on a little more yes yes

2667.839 --> 2673.119
oh strong ox pulling forth a cart but

2671.28 --> 2675.119
who are you pulling forth the cart for

2673.119 --> 2677.359
you dumbass

2675.119 --> 2679.119
you think you'd take a little more oh

2677.359 --> 2681.68
yes yes

2679.119 --> 2684.0
right but who are you pulling the car

2681.68 --> 2687.72
for

2684.0 --> 2687.72
do you even know

2694.72 --> 2698.72
[ __ ] you peace on the plane la mel

2696.88 --> 2701.2000000000003
forever screw that

2698.72 --> 2705.24
[ __ ] peace

2701.2 --> 2705.24
we need to finish this

2706.319 --> 2710.0
we need to finish them off

2710.64 --> 2714.44
[ __ ] peace

2734.72 --> 2739.68
thank you for the support guys

2737.2 --> 2739.68
verbally

2743.359 --> 2748.24
i mean

2744.839 --> 2750.319
how long how many

2748.24 --> 2752.9599999999996
years do i need to periodically keep

2750.319 --> 2752.96
saying this

2753.92 --> 2758.16
what you think i'm

2755.68 --> 2761.1189999999997
i'm secretly of the devil

2758.16 --> 2763.44
and i'm just oh i'm just trying to

2761.119 --> 2767.28
seduce you into war i'm secretly like

2763.44 --> 2768.2400000000002
ben shapiro i'm really not want to worry

2767.28 --> 2770.1600000000003
or

2768.24 --> 2771.2799999999997
i've actually really thought this

2770.16 --> 2773.359
through

2771.28 --> 2774.6400000000003
on the long run and i've been with these

2773.359 --> 2777.44
people

2774.64 --> 2779.68
i know what they are i'm an empath i was

2777.44 --> 2780.48
as an empath with these people in order

2779.68 --> 2783.52
to

2780.48 --> 2786.0
feel out what they really are not your

2783.52 --> 2788.56
[ __ ] little internal preconception of

2786.0 --> 2790.4
what they are but how they actually

2788.56 --> 2794.48
function

2790.4 --> 2796.48
with their spirit how they will react in

2794.48 --> 2800.72
the future

2796.48 --> 2804.56
how i know that there are no limits

2800.72 --> 2808.0789999999997
in what borders they will cross

2804.56 --> 2808.0789999999997
because they don't care

2808.4 --> 2812.48
they are there

2809.839 --> 2816.04
to get on that throne on top of the

2812.48 --> 2816.04
mountain of skulls

2816.16 --> 2820.16
what the demon possessed do

2818.56 --> 2822.56
they are there

2820.16 --> 2826.3999999999996
to use that body

2822.56 --> 2829.52
to get on top of the throne on the pile

2826.4 --> 2832.2400000000002
the mountain of skulls

2829.52 --> 2836.92
and the only way to stop it

2832.24 --> 2836.9199999999996
is to finish them off

2859.2 --> 2861.4399999999996
all right

2862.8 --> 2867.6400000000003
complain the people protect yeah

2876.4 --> 2880.1600000000003
right

2877.2 --> 2882.16
in my opinion what could do the real big

2880.16 --> 2884.48
trick

2882.16 --> 2889.2
it's tough though

2884.48 --> 2892.319
see if the public sector the people

2889.2 --> 2896.8799999999997
can figure out a way

2892.319 --> 2898.4
to get like a real grip on the police

2896.88 --> 2900.4
right

2898.4 --> 2902.64
which they should have done

2900.4 --> 2905.52
like in the first place a long time ago

2902.64 --> 2908.16
to get close with the police

2905.52 --> 2910.16
so you can actually even have gatherings

2908.16 --> 2911.52
and talk about these types of

2910.16 --> 2914.96
complicated

2911.52 --> 2917.2
potentially war related situations

2914.96 --> 2920.16
and that you can as the public trust the

2917.2 --> 2921.1189999999997
police that they are there for you

2920.16 --> 2923.44
more

2921.119 --> 2925.92
than for whatever government is in

2923.44 --> 2925.92
control

2926.0 --> 2928.8
well

2926.839 --> 2931.359
look

2928.8 --> 2936.079
if you get security and police on your

2931.359 --> 2936.0789999999997
side then the government has no chance

2940.16 --> 2944.7999999999997
i mean i cannot think of one

2942.88 --> 2947.839
more efficient way

2944.8 --> 2950.6400000000003
to finish off these [ __ ] scumbag

2947.839 --> 2952.88
globalist pieces of [ __ ]

2950.64 --> 2955.839
by having their own security guards

2952.88 --> 2959.119
basically shoot them in the back

2955.839 --> 2959.119
at a designated time

2962.48 --> 2967.28
that would be the most efficient way

2965.28 --> 2969.3590000000004
with the least amount of public

2967.28 --> 2972.2400000000002
casualties

2969.359 --> 2974.4
but yeah how the hell do you do that

2972.24 --> 2975.68
and i bet that a lot of these security

2974.4 --> 2977.04
people are

2975.68 --> 2978.64
often

2977.04 --> 2979.7599999999998
family

2978.64 --> 2981.7599999999998
right

2979.76 --> 2984.6400000000003
what do you want want to be a globalist

2981.76 --> 2988.88
politician want to be a banker or do you

2984.64 --> 2989.68
want to be a high-tech security guard

2988.88 --> 2992.319
so

2989.68 --> 2992.319
that's tough

2992.4 --> 2997.76
that might simply not become an option

2995.28 --> 3000.48
or become less of an option as time goes

2997.76 --> 3002.48
but you should still get a grip on your

3000.48 --> 3003.76
local police and then make sure that

3002.48 --> 3006.8
they don't

3003.76 --> 3008.96
secretly conspire or

3006.8 --> 3011.44
do anything else

3008.96 --> 3013.28
in favor of the globalist

3011.44 --> 3015.68
every police force should always be

3013.28 --> 3018.8
reminded you are here

3015.68 --> 3021.2
to keep this region stable with the

3018.8 --> 3021.2000000000003
people

3021.52 --> 3025.7599999999998
you are not there

3024.0 --> 3028.0
to

3025.76 --> 3031.28
uphold the principle

3028.0 --> 3032.64
no matter what and just start protecting

3031.28 --> 3036.599
obvious

3032.64 --> 3036.5989999999997
traitors to the country

3046.0 --> 3049.76
or the 66

3048.24 --> 3052.24
yeah

3049.76 --> 3052.2400000000002
why not

3053.119 --> 3056.319
and instead of jedi

3056.64 --> 3060.64
that's funny though because maybe they

3058.72 --> 3064.9199999999996
do think of themselves as shy well in

3060.64 --> 3064.92
that case yeah order 66.

3068.48 --> 3072.88
even the conditions would be kind of

3070.24 --> 3072.8799999999997
right for that

3081.28 --> 3085.6800000000003
your culture of peace

3083.44 --> 3089.04
that's good for you

3085.68 --> 3089.04
then you don't get anything

3089.52 --> 3095.72
you can have your peace in slavery then

3092.24 --> 3095.72
lamel forever

3111.52 --> 3116.0
there's a few reasonable police and they

3113.76 --> 3117.6800000000003
all still followed yeah

3116.0 --> 3119.52
oh

3117.68 --> 3122.0789999999997
then take down

3119.52 --> 3124.559
the non-reasonable police

3122.079 --> 3127.52
or more importantly take down the police

3124.559 --> 3130.6400000000003
chiefs that are up yeah that are keeping

3127.52 --> 3130.64
that [ __ ] in place

3131.359 --> 3136.4
right don't try not to involve the good

3134.24 --> 3139.3999999999996
cops in doing that that would be like

3136.4 --> 3139.4
dangerous

3140.079 --> 3145.6800000000003
but you could still use the good cops to

3142.64 --> 3147.2
basically replace the corrupted police

3145.68 --> 3149.7599999999998
system with

3147.2 --> 3152.24
it's difficult this is a tiresome

3149.76 --> 3154.559
process it's a real community effort to

3152.24 --> 3157.839
get such things done

3154.559 --> 3162.3190000000004
you need real dedication it's like

3157.839 --> 3162.319
it is like a political campaign almost

3162.4 --> 3165.04
what different

3165.359 --> 3169.0789999999997
takes a lot of effort

3201.359 --> 3205.04
yeah

3202.64 --> 3208.04
okay lydia logs before i kick you out

3205.04 --> 3208.04

3209.52 --> 3213.2

3211.2 --> 3215.4399999999996
that are angry they usually have issues

3213.2 --> 3218.3999999999996
in their past yeah they do

3215.44 --> 3220.48
like figuring out how this [ __ ] world

3218.4 --> 3222.64
is monstrous

3220.48 --> 3224.96
and then not being able to cope with

3222.64 --> 3224.96
that

3225.04 --> 3232.16
arguably going insane

3228.079 --> 3233.04
emotionally insane because of that

3232.16 --> 3237.839
and

3233.04 --> 3237.839
awakening a flame of vengeance

3237.92 --> 3241.04
that

3239.119 --> 3243.44
i cannot

3241.04 --> 3247.2
extinct that i cannot extinguish i can't

3243.44 --> 3249.44
do it yeah yeah i have things in my past

3247.2 --> 3251.4399999999996
that have driven me to do this

3249.44 --> 3253.44
to be like this

3251.44 --> 3255.839
yeah it's called confrontation with

3253.44 --> 3258.8
reality and actually knowing how [ __ ]

3255.839 --> 3261.68
up it really is and feeling it feeling

3258.8 --> 3265.8390000000004

some fantasy no actually facing the

3269.599 --> 3273.44
people that do that with glee

3272.319 --> 3275.839
and then

3273.44 --> 3276.96
having revealed that that's real it's

3275.839 --> 3278.5589999999997

3435.92 --> 3439.2000000000003
not

3436.72 --> 3443.2
the fundamental issue

point

3484.24 --> 3489.9199999999996
but what you got to do

3486.24 --> 3492.0789999999997
is you gotta gather a group of people

3489.92 --> 3494.64
and then say

3492.079 --> 3497.92
do you realize it's war

3494.64 --> 3502.48

whatever whatever it's going to be

3519.44 --> 3525.2000000000003
and then discuss it openly don't just do

3522.4 --> 3528.4
it discuss it openly and if you can get

3525.2 --> 3530.799
the people with you guess what

3528.4 --> 3534.1600000000003
if everybody agrees it should be done

3530.799 --> 3534.16
you're not going to go to jail

3535.76 --> 3541.44
you might even get helpers

3538.16 --> 3541.44
that are going to help you do it

3542.319 --> 3547.2
if you're just gonna be a one-man army

3547.2 --> 3551.1189999999997
you're just honest like i this needs to

3549.839 --> 3554.319
be done

3551.119 --> 3554.319
it has to be done

3554.4 --> 3561.799

yeah you know what the best way to

3585.92 --> 3589.599

assassination like that

4044.16 --> 4051.7599999999998
talking about organized community effort

4047.68 --> 4054.24
you go in 20 to 40 people or more

4051.76 --> 4056.88
into government buildings

4054.24 --> 4057.839
and you drag those [ __ ] out of

[Music]

4100.319 --> 4103.319
ah

4104.13 --> 4109.4400000000005
[Music]

that's right guys

4109.44 --> 4112.239
so get ready

what

4137.279 --> 4142.52
terry yeah don't don't worry i got the

4139.52 --> 4142.52
chat

4146.88 --> 4150.679
right on top of it

4196.96 --> 4199.96
right

4208.159 --> 4213.12
i certainly know what i'm gonna title my

4210.32 --> 4213.12
show tomorrow

4214.84 --> 4220.32
psychological spiritual civil war

4218.48 --> 4224.04
sounds like a

4220.32 --> 4224.04
pretty decent title

4308.64 --> 4313.280000000001
has there ever really been peace

4311.36 --> 4315.28
yeah

4313.28 --> 4317.04
just because there's war somewhere in

4315.28 --> 4318.88
the world doesn't mean that there isn't

4317.04 --> 4321.6
any peace

4318.88 --> 4323.679
and the social contract has not been

4321.6 --> 4326.320000000001
broken

4323.679 --> 4328.4800000000005
that long i mean there have always been

4326.32 --> 4331.199
these sneaky scummy

4328.48 --> 4333.5199999999995
elites trying to

4331.199 --> 4335.599999999999
manipulate everything

4333.52 --> 4339.52
but the social contract was still there

4335.6 --> 4339.52
was still in place steep like

4339.6 --> 4344.2390000000005
darkness was all occulted

4343.199 --> 4347.28
and

4344.239 --> 4347.28
it wasn't like this

4348.56 --> 4353.6
this is new

4350.719 --> 4354.719
or well new in this particular period of

4353.6 --> 4356.64
history

4354.719 --> 4358.64
i mean it's not going to be the first

4356.64 --> 4362.719
time that like elites just went

4358.64 --> 4362.719
ballistic and overtly satanic

4363.6 --> 4368.64
right

4365.12 --> 4370.5599999999995
there's more empires where that happened

4368.64 --> 4372.96
elite just go nuts think that they're

4370.56 --> 4374.88
god and just like oh yeah we're more

4372.96 --> 4377.6
important we

4374.88 --> 4379.12
we can just rob you and then kill you

4377.6 --> 4383.2390000000005
that's good

4379.12 --> 4383.239
that's not the first time

4387.18 --> 4390.359
[Music]

4410.88 --> 4415.6
is for when christ returns no

4413.679 --> 4420.159
no don't you get it

4415.6 --> 4424.2390000000005
only way christ returns is through us

4420.159 --> 4428.879999999999
through us following his teachings

4424.239 --> 4428.879999999999
following his frequency being that

4430.64 --> 4436.2390000000005
that's how christ returns through us

4433.84 --> 4438.2390000000005
through our spirit

4436.239 --> 4441.599999999999
but you gotta go there you gotta make

4438.239 --> 4446.839999999999
the sacrifice you gotta

4441.6 --> 4446.84
submit your life to that will

4463.52 --> 4469.080000000001
you can't

4464.56 --> 4469.080000000001
there you cannot wait

4471.679 --> 4475.92
if your strategy involves waiting for

4474.239 --> 4478.959999999999
something to happen

4475.92 --> 4481.1990000000005
then you're a failure

4478.96 --> 4484.4800000000005
doesn't matter what the reason is or the

4481.199 --> 4487.12
backstory for that doesn't matter if

4484.48 --> 4489.599999999999
you think that waiting is a solution to

4487.12 --> 4495.0
what's happening you're wrong and you're

4489.6 --> 4495.0
a failure and a weakling and a coward

4503.44 --> 4507.36
don't see us overcoming it without

4505.6 --> 4510.08
supernatural power

4507.36 --> 4511.839999999999
well maybe you just underestimate the

4510.08 --> 4517.44
power

4511.84 --> 4517.4400000000005
through man like the power of man right

4517.76 --> 4523.6
i mean oh so god you know what

4520.239 --> 4525.44
supernatural power is right

4523.6 --> 4527.120000000001
it's power of god

4525.44 --> 4529.12
beyond the

4527.12 --> 4532.8
that which we can understand well that

4529.12 --> 4532.8
comes through us you dummy

4533.36 --> 4538.799999999999
yeah that's the point

4536.08 --> 4541.679
you can be christ

4538.8 --> 4543.84
he literally said it

4541.679 --> 4546.96
greater than him

4543.84 --> 4549.92
he set an example for you to follow when

4546.96 --> 4550.96
you follow it you get that you get that

4549.92 --> 4553.6
power

4550.96 --> 4555.84
you get the supernatural power you can

4553.6 --> 4558.96
have it and use it

4555.84 --> 4563.8
don't you understand

4558.96 --> 4563.8
like nobody gets this about christ

4575.76 --> 4581.12
yeah like oh everybody loves the dollar

4578.32 --> 4584.159
bill that's that's weakness it's

4581.12 --> 4586.4
escapism if you show that you don't and

4584.159 --> 4589.36
you truly show it

4586.4 --> 4592.239
then that will weaken the devil's grip

4589.36 --> 4594.639999999999
on people's minds concerning that the

4592.239 --> 4597.04
example the christ's way you have to

4594.64 --> 4599.679
actually deprive yourself you have to

4597.04 --> 4603.44
actually not do it you have to actually

4599.679 --> 4605.52
not give in to the seduction you weak

4603.44 --> 4607.5199999999995
[ __ ]

4605.52 --> 4609.52
that's the way to do it that's how you

4607.52 --> 4612.719
get the power that's how you get it

4609.52 --> 4616.159000000001
that's how you get god's rewards by not

4612.719 --> 4619.76
giving in to the seductions that's the

4616.159 --> 4620.839999999999
point that was the only point

4619.76 --> 4625.1990000000005
to it

4620.84 --> 4626.2390000000005
all it was the point just don't do it

4625.199 --> 4627.5199999999995
anymore

4626.239 --> 4629.44
give it up

4627.52 --> 4632.159000000001
step away

4629.44 --> 4634.32
stop giving into weakness like

4632.159 --> 4637.199
don't even recognize

4634.32 --> 4639.84
that it is a weakness

4637.199 --> 4642.32
that you have to do it no you're just

4639.84 --> 4643.6
[ __ ] weak you just have to say no and

4642.32 --> 4645.759999999999
step away

4643.6 --> 4648.64
and then not do it anymore

4645.76 --> 4652.400000000001
and freaking make sure you stop wanting

4648.64 --> 4652.400000000001
it condition it out here

4652.56 --> 4658.1990000000005
just stop doing that stop being weak

4675.11 --> 4679.92
[Music]

4677.84 --> 4679.92
you

4683.43 --> 4686.619000000001
[Music]

4694.8 --> 4698.400000000001
everybody needs money

4696.96 --> 4699.92
yeah and

4698.4 --> 4702.159
so do i

4699.92 --> 4702.159
so

4703.6 --> 4709.120000000001
money is only effectively earthly

4705.84 --> 4711.6
sustenance in it like translated trapped

4709.12 --> 4713.44
in a formula

4711.6 --> 4716.159000000001
right

4713.44 --> 4718.48
so technically no you don't always need

4716.159 --> 4721.199
money you can actually live without it

4718.48 --> 4724.159
is possible just that most people just

4721.199 --> 4726.719
don't want to do it so easy

4724.159 --> 4728.32
so easy yeah that's the whole point of

4726.719 --> 4732.52
it

4728.32 --> 4732.5199999999995
that's the point of the seductions

4749.84 --> 4754.400000000001
you must prepare to be crucified yeah

4752.32 --> 4756.799999999999
except

4754.4 --> 4758.719
well we must be prepared that they're

4756.8 --> 4760.719
gonna try to do that

4758.719 --> 4764.159
but you see

4760.719 --> 4766.4
yeah allegedly jesus just let that all

4764.159 --> 4768.879999999999
happen right well

4766.4 --> 4771.04
we don't have to

4768.88 --> 4774.96
we must be prepared to be

4771.04 --> 4777.28
the recipient of a similar situation

4774.96 --> 4781.199
but yeah

4777.28 --> 4783.759999999999
you can actually resist

4781.199 --> 4783.759999999999
you could

4787.12 --> 4792.5599999999995
yeah there were even people surrounding

4789.199 --> 4795.199
jesus that were asking him to do that

4792.56 --> 4798.320000000001
like please let's let's just

4795.199 --> 4801.44
go at war with these [ __ ] romans

4798.32 --> 4801.44
let's finish him off

4801.76 --> 4807.360000000001
and he didn't do that yeah he didn't do

4805.04 --> 4807.36
that

4807.6 --> 4812.400000000001
yeah he did not tell everybody that

4810.239 --> 4816.5599999999995
you're not supposed to do that it was

4812.4 --> 4820.5599999999995
his personal thing that he did

4816.56 --> 4820.56
not us not everybody

4824.8 --> 4829.6
yeah we just have to follow his

4826.48 --> 4832.718999999999
teachings we don't have to literally

4829.6 --> 4836.08
mimic his entire life that's pointless

4832.719 --> 4837.04
it's about the words the words that he

4836.08 --> 4838.32
said

4837.04 --> 4840.32
the methods

4838.32 --> 4843.5599999999995
the insights

4840.32 --> 4843.5599999999995
the effects

4846.0 --> 4851.199
you don't always just have to

4848.639 --> 4854.56
go on and on and on until the enemy gets

4851.199 --> 4859.239
you and then just be crucified that's

4854.56 --> 4859.2390000000005
not the [ __ ] point of christ

4873.679 --> 4878.08
yeah

4874.639 --> 4882.32
don't be a christ reenactor

4878.08 --> 4886.0
just follow his teachings

4882.32 --> 4888.719
understand the patterns that he revealed

4886.0 --> 4891.12
how things happen he revealed so much of

4888.719 --> 4893.92
how things happen and we all take it for

4891.12 --> 4895.36
granted we don't even look at it anymore

4893.92 --> 4896.639
because it's all kind of like yeah it's

4895.36 --> 4897.599999999999
all integrated

4896.639 --> 4900.719
yeah but you don't have any

4897.6 --> 4900.719
consciousness about it

4900.96 --> 4906.719
understand

4902.4 --> 4906.719
what happened what people did

4908.239 --> 4916.32
and remember his teachings the words

4912.56 --> 4919.6
like not like not even the actions as

4916.32 --> 4919.599999999999
much but the words

4927.12 --> 4930.96
what was the point of christ to show us

4929.679 --> 4933.679
the path

4930.96 --> 4935.92
to show us how god's design

4933.679 --> 4939.92
works and what you should do and what

4935.92 --> 4942.8
you should not do he clarified it he

4939.92 --> 4946.08
he was a pioneer on that map

4942.8 --> 4950.400000000001
that spiritual map to show the way

4946.08 --> 4954.5599999999995
how to do this how to get closer to god

4950.4 --> 4954.5599999999995
how to effectively ascend

4954.639 --> 4958.1990000000005
that's what he did

4960.8 --> 4967.04
right but you always have to

4963.199 --> 4969.28
look into that in context of the era

4967.04 --> 4971.5199999999995
when it happened

4969.28 --> 4973.04
it's all adapted

4971.52 --> 4974.8
idealized

4973.04 --> 4978.4
to suit for

4974.8 --> 4978.400000000001
how things worked then

4979.92 --> 4984.4800000000005
no ben white that's a lie

4982.08 --> 4987.84
that's ridiculous ben white where the

4984.48 --> 4987.839999999999
hell did you even get that from

4990.159 --> 4997.44
it's not true

4992.159 --> 4997.44
muslims recognize jesus as a prophet

4998.08 --> 5005.679
so you're wrong

5001.199 --> 5005.678999999999
probably listen to some troll [ __ ]

5008.08 --> 5014.159
or some [ __ ] that's like

5010.56 --> 5017.84
islamophobic which is a real thing

5014.159 --> 5017.839999999999
the one trooper no

5022.88 --> 5026.4800000000005
to them

5024.159 --> 5028.799999999999
yeah it's their teacher muhammad is

5026.48 --> 5030.879999999999
their prophet is their teacher yeah i

5028.8 --> 5034.719
get it they choose their prophet over

5030.88 --> 5035.84
jesus the prophet also recognized by

5034.719 --> 5038.4
islam

5035.84 --> 5038.400000000001
okay

5041.12 --> 5045.679
and i recognize muhammad as a prophet

5045.76 --> 5049.84
i just like jesus a lot more

5050.48 --> 5057.199
i feel that's closer to a frequency of

5054.159 --> 5058.4
ascension that i that makes sense to me

5057.199 --> 5062.0
that is

5058.4 --> 5062.0
that's more fitted for me

5067.76 --> 5074.96
vatican created no

5070.8 --> 5074.96
i mean they meddled with it no doubt

5076.239 --> 5080.799999999999
they were [ __ ] around with it but

5078.88 --> 5082.8
muhammad is just

5080.8 --> 5084.8
a prophet

5082.8 --> 5087.1990000000005
right and then of course as soon as a

5084.8 --> 5088.8
prophet's gonna be anywhere immediately

5087.199 --> 5091.36
the vatican is gonna send out their

5088.8 --> 5093.6
agents that what they did

5091.36 --> 5095.599999999999
it's not doesn't mean that they created

5093.6 --> 5097.6
it you have too much

5095.6 --> 5100.400000000001
like they can't do that that doesn't

5097.6 --> 5100.400000000001
work that way

5106.0 --> 5113.0
they respond to things that you can't

5108.159 --> 5113.0
just create out of nothing

5115.04 --> 5120.639
they have to wait until something real

5117.12 --> 5122.28
happens a real energy gateway is created

5120.639 --> 5125.76
and then they

5122.28 --> 5128.639
encapsulate it they parasite it they

5125.76 --> 5132.8
converted into another version

5128.639 --> 5135.4400000000005
right just like the roman pantheon

5132.8 --> 5137.1990000000005
was a corrupted

5135.44 --> 5139.199
conversion

5137.199 --> 5142.4
of the greek pantheon

5139.199 --> 5145.36
that's how they do it they can't create

5142.4 --> 5146.638999999999
something completely from scratch out of

5145.36 --> 5149.28
nothing

5146.639 --> 5153.36
you have to understand this

5149.28 --> 5157.36
this is so key this is key

5153.36 --> 5157.36
like on an existential level

5162.08 --> 5164.719
what the [ __ ]

5166.0 --> 5169.84
how are you talking about ben white

5183.84 --> 5190.8
oh somebody that was a muslim told you

5186.48 --> 5193.5199999999995
that okay well i'm glad that he's like

5190.8 --> 5196.4800000000005
the the the imam

5193.52 --> 5197.4400000000005
okay ben white i'm sure he was like a

5196.48 --> 5200.5599999999995
very

5197.44 --> 5203.599999999999
important imam that definitely

5200.56 --> 5206.159000000001
knows about those things right it's

5203.6 --> 5209.04
i mean it's not like muslims are not

5206.159 --> 5210.799999999999
just regular people that read the quran

5209.04 --> 5213.6
and then have their own interpretations

5210.8 --> 5214.4800000000005
based on their own intellectual heights

5213.6 --> 5216.639
right

5214.48 --> 5219.44
oh wait yes

5216.639 --> 5222.56
yes people do actually have stupid

5219.44 --> 5225.28
interpretations of of islam as well just

5222.56 --> 5228.96
like christians do with the bible yeah

5225.28 --> 5228.96
that actually does happen a lot

5231.36 --> 5234.48
that's right clutch they don't think he

5233.28 --> 5238.92
is god

5234.48 --> 5238.919999999999
and neither do i

5239.76 --> 5244.719
think god was with him oh sure oh yes he

5243.28 --> 5248.159
was

5244.719 --> 5250.8
it was not god makes no sense

5248.159 --> 5252.638999999999
the basic trinity [ __ ] that owen

5250.8 --> 5256.0
benjamin also complains about and

5252.639 --> 5259.52
rightfully so is [ __ ]

5256.0 --> 5262.159
it's insane it is literally insane

5259.52 --> 5264.080000000001
illogical

5262.159 --> 5266.96
so yeah of course muslims are not going

5264.08 --> 5269.92
to go with that insanity and say that he

5266.96 --> 5272.8
is god because that's a blasphemy yeah

5269.92 --> 5275.52
they don't say that about muhammad

5272.8 --> 5278.2390000000005
either because that's blasphemy they

5275.52 --> 5279.4400000000005
actually understand that about their own

5278.239 --> 5282.48
religion

5279.44 --> 5284.719
unlike some freaking looney christians

5282.48 --> 5287.199
they'll just believe whatever the [ __ ] a

5284.719 --> 5288.8
priest tells them

5287.199 --> 5291.678999999999
okay

5288.8 --> 5291.679
that's the problem

5292.32 --> 5295.92
christianity has just become too

5294.08 --> 5298.32
delusional

5295.92 --> 5303.4800000000005
it's lost its cohesion it's just

5298.32 --> 5303.48
whatever the [ __ ] priest says goes

5320.639 --> 5323.28
hey hello by the way the virgin droid

5322.4 --> 5325.719999999999
yeah

5323.28 --> 5327.92
i think i got plenty of attention here

5325.72 --> 5331.76
[Music]

5327.92 --> 5331.76
i should have after my rant

5332.0 --> 5336.159
about

5333.25 --> 5339.199
[Music]

5336.159 --> 5341.92
psychological spiritual civil war that's

5339.199 --> 5344.08
about to unfold

5341.92 --> 5346.639
or rather it's already underway it's

5344.08 --> 5350.12
just we've got to actually reach an

5346.639 --> 5350.12
action phase

5350.239 --> 5355.04
we probably just will

5352.239 --> 5357.36
i i really hope that it will actually

5355.04 --> 5360.8
still just work and not

5357.36 --> 5365.639
fizzle because that would be

5360.8 --> 5365.639
well the end of my hopes for humanity

5387.44 --> 5392.678999999999
you did it susie s cool that's

5389.679 --> 5392.679
interesting

5398.239 --> 5403.12
right so yeah ben white just know

5401.36 --> 5404.639
just because somebody is a muslim

5403.12 --> 5407.12
doesn't mean that they can't be

5404.639 --> 5409.84
delusional or lie

5407.12 --> 5410.88
i mean they're not supposed to

5409.84 --> 5413.360000000001
but

5410.88 --> 5415.92
they still face sin

5413.36 --> 5418.839999999999
and some fail and get delusional i mean

5415.92 --> 5420.56
this is a [ __ ] crazy world

5418.84 --> 5422.88
so

5420.56 --> 5424.8
you would almost say you can't blame

5422.88 --> 5427.04
them but then again you of course you

5424.8 --> 5427.04
can

5430.239 --> 5434.159
right

5432.239 --> 5436.48
but yeah thanks guys for backing me up

5434.159 --> 5436.48
on that

5439.36 --> 5442.719
or extreme but it's not even an

5440.96 --> 5444.56
extremist bandwidth that's not an

5442.719 --> 5446.56
extremist

5444.56 --> 5448.96
they're just people that are just wrong

5446.56 --> 5450.400000000001
and stupid

5448.96 --> 5452.0
right just because you're a muslim

5450.4 --> 5454.32
doesn't mean you can't be wrong about

5452.0 --> 5454.32
things

5456.159 --> 5460.28
or have aberrant opinions

5461.97 --> 5465.479
[Music]

5465.92 --> 5472.08
that's right clutch it is

5468.56 --> 5474.639
yeah it is satanic christianity

5472.08 --> 5476.32
the the trinity version where christ is

5474.639 --> 5478.639
god

5476.32 --> 5480.159
and then oh because of what he did you

5478.639 --> 5483.6
can do whatever the [ __ ] you want yeah

5480.159 --> 5486.4
that's just satanism it's

5483.6 --> 5487.84
the false form of christianity a lot of

5486.4 --> 5491.5199999999995
sophistry

5487.84 --> 5493.76
and and like some moral contemplations

5491.52 --> 5496.0
there's a lot of mysticism surrounding

5493.76 --> 5498.4800000000005
it to encapsulate the

5496.0 --> 5501.28
perfectly

5498.48 --> 5503.12
pure words of christ which are still in

5501.28 --> 5505.199
there it's just that

5503.12 --> 5507.599999999999
you got the pure words and then you got

5505.199 --> 5509.04
a whole bunch of other stuff that's like

5507.6 --> 5511.4400000000005
oh that means this that means that the

5509.04 --> 5514.239
middle yes yes oh this is how we think

5511.44 --> 5517.04
it is now yes that right

5514.239 --> 5519.919999999999
that's all a distraction is just the

5517.04 --> 5522.0
words of christ that's that's the actual

5519.92 --> 5523.76
value in the book

5522.0 --> 5526.4
and the rest is all

5523.76 --> 5529.04
all roots of distraction

5526.4 --> 5530.799999999999
all priestly tools

5529.04 --> 5533.679
of mind control

5530.8 --> 5536.719
of making you more dependent on a mind

5533.679 --> 5536.719
outside of your own

5542.56 --> 5547.84
dwellings it's all written dwellings

5545.52 --> 5549.92
so you can dwell in the book

5547.84 --> 5551.679
right if it was just jesus's words there

5549.92 --> 5553.36
would be no dwelling

5551.679 --> 5555.36
you would just get it it's just you open

5553.36 --> 5556.88
it up and like oh yeah oh this yeah of

5555.36 --> 5560.759999999999
course

5556.88 --> 5560.76
there would be no dwelling

5579.04 --> 5582.56
okay

5579.92 --> 5584.719
are you sure about that steamy traveler

5582.56 --> 5587.360000000001
that is very interesting

5584.719 --> 5589.12
so you don't believe in the trinity no

5587.36 --> 5592.32
of course i don't believe in that

5589.12 --> 5593.84
ridiculous trinity

5592.32 --> 5597.28
i mean

5593.84 --> 5597.28
a trinity is a pattern

5598.08 --> 5604.159
jesus christ was not

5600.159 --> 5606.719
the designer one true god incarnated in

5604.159 --> 5609.759999999999
the flesh within his own creation

5606.719 --> 5613.12
that died is totally absurd and

5609.76 --> 5616.96
ridiculous it's like mind

5613.12 --> 5620.239
blowingly face slappingly stupid

5616.96 --> 5621.44
like if somebody would just say that

5620.239 --> 5623.678999999999
then like

5621.44 --> 5625.678999999999
take it outside of a religious context

5623.679 --> 5627.1990000000005
just like by replacing the names or

5625.679 --> 5631.12
something right

5627.199 --> 5634.48
if somebody would just tell you that

5631.12 --> 5637.28
straight face i mean i would have a very

5634.48 --> 5641.28
strong tendency to slap you in the face

5637.28 --> 5644.4
if you said something as stupid as that

5641.28 --> 5647.84
it's so stupid

5644.4 --> 5650.08
you gotta be a [ __ ] mind numb

5647.84 --> 5652.88
intellectual slave

5650.08 --> 5655.679
to a priesthood in order to get yourself

5652.88 --> 5656.8
to [ __ ] that badly intellectually and

5655.679 --> 5659.84
say that

5656.8 --> 5659.84
it's terrible

5663.76 --> 5668.8
the trinity thing i mean

5666.8 --> 5670.96
about mary that's that's a different

5668.8 --> 5674.2390000000005
deal

5670.96 --> 5674.2390000000005
i mean i respect that

5676.56 --> 5681.52
but yeah there's then there's people

5678.88 --> 5682.96
that say oh but it means it's more or

5681.52 --> 5684.400000000001
equal or

5682.96 --> 5687.52
then i'm like

5684.4 --> 5690.239
i'm sorry jesus was a prophet mary was

5687.52 --> 5690.2390000000005
not a prophet

5691.679 --> 5697.28
i mean mary's words are not

5694.8 --> 5700.56
like oh my god that's so fractal

5697.28 --> 5703.119
thinking no no they weren't she was just

5700.56 --> 5704.400000000001
a really

5703.119 --> 5707.199
powerful

5704.4 --> 5707.199
blessed woman

5707.28 --> 5710.639
with a very special role

5710.8 --> 5716.88
but not a prophet

5714.239 --> 5718.718999999999
am i a christian

5716.88 --> 5720.32
i'd like to think so

5718.719 --> 5722.639
i mean i am

5720.32 --> 5725.36
i do my best to be a follower of the

5722.639 --> 5727.4400000000005
path of christ which is not something

5725.36 --> 5729.839999999999
you can look up and then get it all

5727.44 --> 5729.839999999999
defined

5730.239 --> 5736.48
i don't follow a book

5733.52 --> 5739.119000000001
i follow principles and i follow words

5736.48 --> 5739.119
of wisdom

5739.84 --> 5743.56
and i follow patterns

5745.44 --> 5750.239
but i do actually like

5748.32 --> 5751.5199999999995
even

5750.239 --> 5754.159
chant

5751.52 --> 5756.88
the word the name of jesus christ in in

5754.159 --> 5759.199
some of my prayers so yeah i'd say i'm a

5756.88 --> 5762.32
christian yeah

5759.199 --> 5765.28
i mean there's a lot of christians

5762.32 --> 5768.159
you're the bible hardcore you have to uh

5765.28 --> 5770.08
he is god and uh

5768.159 --> 5772.0
he died for essentially whatever the

5770.08 --> 5775.36
[ __ ] you want because you're forgiven

5772.0 --> 5777.84
anyway if you just say this chant yeah

5775.36 --> 5781.04
those people are gonna not recognize me

5777.84 --> 5782.88
being a christian of course

5781.04 --> 5785.679
but i don't think they're christians i

5782.88 --> 5789.04
think they're actually satanists that

5785.679 --> 5791.76
think they're christians

5789.04 --> 5794.08
which is exactly what the vatican wanted

5791.76 --> 5795.679
to create that's what they did with

5794.08 --> 5799.199
christ

5795.679 --> 5802.2390000000005
first started out by murdering his

5799.199 --> 5803.44
original church complete genocide his

5802.239 --> 5805.919999999999
original

5803.44 --> 5808.08
jesus christ church they destroyed it

5805.92 --> 5810.2390000000005
they murdered everybody that was

5808.08 --> 5813.44
associated with it

5810.239 --> 5817.04
blatant genocide and then

5813.44 --> 5821.119
i see a council then they just decide oh

5817.04 --> 5823.5199999999995
this is the real christianity now

5821.119 --> 5826.88
yes let's just write all this [ __ ]

5823.52 --> 5827.639
surrounding it

5826.88 --> 5829.6
to

5827.639 --> 5831.679
encapsulate

5829.6 --> 5834.88
christ's power

5831.679 --> 5837.92
conceal it from the public and then take

5834.88 --> 5839.679
ownership of it

5837.92 --> 5841.52
with the theocracy

5839.679 --> 5844.4
that's what the vatican did and that's

5841.52 --> 5846.96
the christianity we're left with

5844.4 --> 5849.759999999999
the original christianity that lit

5846.96 --> 5851.28
literal christ's church his original

5849.76 --> 5852.4800000000005
church that was

5851.28 --> 5855.84
there

5852.48 --> 5855.839999999999
when he was alive

5856.159 --> 5861.36
that is destroyed we don't even know

5859.04 --> 5864.0
what it was exactly

5861.36 --> 5867.119
we don't even know exactly like

5864.0 --> 5869.36
what they all did we just sparingly

5867.119 --> 5874.32
sparing references

5869.36 --> 5874.32
it was erased it was erased from history

5879.199 --> 5882.839999999999
i know you are clutch

5888.56 --> 5895.0
so i'm going to run out this show

5891.28 --> 5895.0
be nice and controversial

5896.639 --> 5900.96
it's good to get a little pissed off

5898.719 --> 5902.96
every now and then not too often though

5900.96 --> 5905.28
that's just annoying

5902.96 --> 5905.28
ah

5905.76 --> 5911.52
do not take the title of

5908.84 --> 5915.76
christian right well if somebody look if

5911.52 --> 5918.2390000000005
a a normie would ask are you a christian

5915.76 --> 5920.639
then i would just not say yes

5918.239 --> 5922.879999999999
i'd always try to be more specific say

5920.639 --> 5925.84
like yeah i'm

5922.88 --> 5925.84
an eclectic

5926.199 --> 5931.36
islamopagan christian

5929.199 --> 5933.119
follower of the path of his specific

5931.36 --> 5935.04
words

5933.119 --> 5936.159
and then people would already be like

5935.04 --> 5937.92
what

5936.159 --> 5940.799999999999
oh we're gonna look that up yeah that's

5937.92 --> 5942.639
not an officially registered thing

5940.8 --> 5944.4800000000005
it's my personal

5942.639 --> 5947.1990000000005
form of christianity eclectic

5944.48 --> 5947.199
self-taught

5948.32 --> 5951.599999999999
and then most people would already be

5950.0 --> 5955.04
like what

5951.6 --> 5955.04
so it doesn't really matter

5958.8 --> 5963.76
because behavior and heart reflects

5961.04 --> 5967.08
jesus christ right

5963.76 --> 5967.08
that's correct

5968.0 --> 5973.36
now the tough part is where how you

5971.199 --> 5975.28
actually divine

5973.36 --> 5976.239
what that is because

5975.28 --> 5980.48
the

5976.239 --> 5983.199
vatican priesthood has been trying to

5980.48 --> 5984.32
specifically give you a definition of

5983.199 --> 5986.239
how

5984.32 --> 5988.719
that's supposed to be

5986.239 --> 5991.5199999999995
they gave their interpretation for you

5988.719 --> 5993.119
to follow and to be a christian

5991.52 --> 5996.88
see

5993.119 --> 5998.639
it's very difficult to actually

5996.88 --> 6000.88
get to that point where you truly

5998.639 --> 6003.84
understand it you have to lay down all

6000.88 --> 6005.119
seductions to get there

6003.84 --> 6008.8
and that is

6005.119 --> 6008.799999999999
a titanic

6009.52 --> 6014.92
that's a titan's quest it's super tough

6022.56 --> 6026.8
right and if you fail to lay down

6024.8 --> 6028.719
certain seductions then you will try to

6026.8 --> 6030.719
graft in those seductions within your

6028.719 --> 6032.08
interpretation of the path in order to

6030.719 --> 6034.2390000000005
justify them

6032.08 --> 6036.239
and then you've effectively created a

6034.239 --> 6038.32
corrupt and corrupted form of

6036.239 --> 6041.678999999999
christianity

6038.32 --> 6041.679
of the path interpretation

6042.56 --> 6048.56
and sometimes i think that

6045.199 --> 6052.5599999999995
i might risk doing that by accident

6048.56 --> 6055.4400000000005
so i'm always ready to be

6052.56 --> 6057.84
told by somebody that i know i can trust

6055.44 --> 6060.5599999999995
to tell me like wait but hold on

6057.84 --> 6062.32
here's literal jesus christ's words in

6060.56 --> 6065.04
this very specific

6062.32 --> 6066.5599999999995
situation with a very specific context

6065.04 --> 6068.32
do you agree with me and then we can

6066.56 --> 6070.88
discuss like what is that that's

6068.32 --> 6073.599999999999
happening over there

6070.88 --> 6075.92
is that straightforward enough to be

6073.6 --> 6078.56
assigned to me like no wait what i

6075.92 --> 6081.76
assumed was completely wrong like for

6078.56 --> 6083.92
example you could debate with me like

6081.76 --> 6086.320000000001
about the passivity thing i don't think

6083.92 --> 6088.0
that jesus was all that passive now of

6086.32 --> 6090.08
course we got the famous

6088.0 --> 6091.28
turning the tables of the money changers

6090.08 --> 6094.159
in the temple

6091.28 --> 6095.759999999999
situation but that's just one

6094.159 --> 6098.4
little thing

6095.76 --> 6101.84
i think it's reached much wider

6098.4 --> 6104.0
i mean jesus was not a tolerant person

6101.84 --> 6105.52
at all

6104.0 --> 6107.199
and he was very

6105.52 --> 6109.6
like defensive

6107.199 --> 6111.5199999999995
like yeah

6109.6 --> 6114.0
you have to defend

6111.52 --> 6115.679
good people

6114.0 --> 6117.52
not just point out oh these are good

6115.679 --> 6118.4800000000005
people those are bad people and then do

6117.52 --> 6122.719
nothing

6118.48 --> 6122.718999999999
when evil goes after the innocent

6123.04 --> 6124.88
anyway

6123.65 --> 6126.4
