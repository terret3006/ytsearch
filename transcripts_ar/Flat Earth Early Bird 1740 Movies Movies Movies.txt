2023 all right yeah sorry for starting a

143.84 --> 149.92000000000002
little late or a little kind of a lot of

146.56 --> 152.48
late it's going to be a short show today

149.92 --> 152.48
but yeah I

152.72 --> 156.56
overslept Restless in the

157.68 --> 164.519
night and I slept till like 15

161.8 --> 166.15900000000002
1 and then I really rushed till I get

164.519 --> 168.159
the show started because I definitely

166.159 --> 170.2
was going to do a

168.159 --> 172.56
show

170.2 --> 174.83999999999997
right so let's make the best of this

172.56 --> 174.84
short

175.76 --> 184.07999999999998
show if is gone yeah now since yesterday

180.239 --> 188.12
she has not she he whatever them versus

184.08 --> 188.12
them versus us has not shown up in that

188.68 --> 195.959
form so it seems like the entire Act was

192.56 --> 199.159
dropped I totally did expect to be

195.959 --> 202.959
potentially wrong and then her just

199.159 --> 207.76
going off in other places like who AR's

202.959 --> 212.36
just calling me fake now but no no I

207.76 --> 212.35999999999999
totally or oh thank to Emma

213.56 --> 219.72
peal I took it I went full on in it and

217.48 --> 219.72
it's

221.68 --> 226.36
gone and I still kind of feel sick about

224.159 --> 228.12
it I mean I can't believe somebody

226.36 --> 231.0
actually

228.12 --> 233.239
like made a whole effort to make an act

231.0 --> 237.12
to be like a a a

233.239 --> 239.76
woman online and like to really

237.12 --> 243.68
like cuz there was very little spontan

239.76 --> 243.67999999999998
anous responses you might have noticed

246.159 --> 252.56
right was a lot of like thinking about

249.92 --> 256.71999999999997
like what would e say instead of

252.56 --> 256.72
spontaneous reactions to certain

256.759 --> 263.04
things and that made it all like

260.28 --> 265.23999999999995
yeah didn't really like there was it was

263.04 --> 265.24
just

268.6 --> 271.6
incomplete

274.32 --> 279.039
but yeah so that that sort of activity

276.84 --> 281.59999999999997
goes on here I guess very

279.039 --> 284.24
disturbing I'm glad was able to figure

281.6 --> 289.72

defending Eevee a week

405.479 --> 411.199

408.639 --> 414.319
a woman just trying to like wanting to

411.199 --> 416.199
be part of it this or something

414.319 --> 417.96000000000004

annoying and poorly timed I don't just

[Music]

717.959 --> 722.399
okay all right so it is troll

723.2 --> 729.72
season yesterday was very

726.6 --> 732.0400000000001
noticeable a whole bunch of like really

729.72 --> 733.44
butt hurt people all started sending me

732.04 --> 736.5999999999999
emails and all

733.44 --> 738.72
that how terrible I am seriously there's

736.6 --> 741.279
someone there's multiple people I think

738.72 --> 743.48
it's not just one that are continually

741.279 --> 746.16
trying to just send me emails on how

743.48 --> 746.16
terrible I

746.48 --> 751.72
am and they really think like I'm going

749.12 --> 755.24
to read that I mean it does remind me of

751.72 --> 755.24
like Owen Benjamin

755.399 --> 760.199
commenters cuz they're that terrible

758.519 --> 763.16
sometimes I think like maybe I should

760.199 --> 765.0
just like not delete them and save one

763.16 --> 768.7199999999999
of them just

765.0 --> 771.88
for you know just so I could read it but

768.72 --> 774.44
it's it's like it's almost not funny

771.88 --> 777.8389999999999
enough it's just so

774.44 --> 780.839
sour that I'm just throwing them

777.839 --> 780.839
away

788.16 --> 795.399
I mean I I for some reason I just really

791.079 --> 798.079
get the bile going in in gamas I really

795.399 --> 801.16
do like maybe even more than with Owen

798.079 --> 803.279
Benjamin except that Owen Benjamin just

801.16 --> 806.36
probably gives the gamas more jealousy

803.279 --> 808.8389999999999
and all that and envy so they just and

806.36 --> 810.6
because he's more out in the open so

808.839 --> 814.8000000000001
they're all trying to

810.6 --> 820.639
like get in his face even more and

814.8 --> 820.639
louder because he's just well very well

821.639 --> 826.6
known me not so much oh could you

824.32 --> 829.12
imagine how the how they would go

826.6 --> 831.44
completely ballistic if I suddenly get

829.12 --> 831.44
more

832.44 --> 837.0
reach dude I'd get all weirded out if I

835.279 --> 838.88
suddenly got more Rich that would mean

837.0 --> 842.04
like oh [ __ ] now I actually have to to

838.88 --> 845.24
behave even better damn

842.04 --> 847.88

he was so impressed about

it's

934.839 --> 938.48
gone the hell just

945.519 --> 950.759
happened call her out three weeks ago

948.04 --> 950.759
okay well that was

957.6 --> 960.6
quick

978.16 --> 985.319
got uster sized for it

981.319 --> 988.16
too yeah well there was no leads

985.319 --> 990.319
viod yeah it is no freaking point just

988.16 --> 991.24
like starting to scream and like oh this

990.319 --> 994.16
is a

991.24 --> 995.759
troll when there lit there's literally

994.16 --> 1001.24
no leads for it

995.759 --> 1001.24
yet except well potentially suspicious

1002.6 --> 1006.279
Behavior that's not good

1010.199 --> 1015.8389999999999
enough you literally had proof no no you

1017.48 --> 1022.24
didn't you the stream lagging no there's

1020.199 --> 1025.9199999999998
some weird connection issues with OBS

1022.24 --> 1025.92
that happened a few minutes ago zap

1043.48 --> 1047.1200000000001
tappy why does it

1047.4 --> 1050.4
matter

1054.48 --> 1057.799
what the [ __ ] are you talking about Orin

1056.36 --> 1062.1599999999999
NOA

1057.799 --> 1062.16
wumble why are you bringing that

1073.88 --> 1078.96
up she was going back and forth with

1076.36 --> 1081.12
Chuck Wagner yeah well

1078.96 --> 1084.8400000000001
she would potentially not have known who

1081.12 --> 1087.6
the hell that is and she has criticism

1084.84 --> 1090.28
she had like a bad mouth about things so

1087.6 --> 1091.84
yeah makes sense and Chuck Wagner tries

1090.28 --> 1095.0
to

1091.84 --> 1098.4399999999998
like cozy up with everybody that that

1095.0 --> 1098.44
gets some kind of treatment

1100.0 --> 1103.52
so that's not

1106.24 --> 1111.96
evidence that's just her kind of [ __ ]

1109.32 --> 1111.96
talking with a

1112.0 --> 1116.28
troll yeah that's suspicious for sure

1114.52 --> 1118.559
it's not evidence of anything though

1116.28 --> 1118.559
five

1128.039 --> 1135.039
wrad because it was mentioned calling e

1131.48 --> 1137.32
yeah because she basically tried to play

1135.039 --> 1140.32
on my sympathy with

1137.32 --> 1140.32
it

1140.88 --> 1146.919
she by being female it's complicated but

1145.12 --> 1149.6399999999999
I was trying they were trying to

1146.919 --> 1151.96
manipulate me into being

1149.64 --> 1154.24
chivalrous I want to be chivalrous

1151.96 --> 1157.3600000000001
especially against women that are

1154.24 --> 1160.24
like just being treated very nastily

1157.36 --> 1165.08
without any real reason yeah that brings

1160.24 --> 1168.48
the shiver nature in out in me and

1165.08 --> 1171.24
that's really why I'm so outraged cuz I

1168.48 --> 1173.44
feel like I was abused

1171.24 --> 1175.76
psychologically by somebody pretending

1173.44 --> 1178.52
to be a women a woman in distress a

1175.76 --> 1184.4
damel in distress yeah that's

1178.52 --> 1184.4
specifically it's very personal that way

1185.48 --> 1190.1200000000001
okay like otherwise I wouldn't give a

1187.919 --> 1192.88
[ __ ] if it's just some person turns out

1190.12 --> 1195.6
not to be real who gives a [ __ ] yeah I

1192.88 --> 1195.6000000000001
was [ __ ]

1197.24 --> 1200.24
manipulated

1205.94 --> 1209.13
[Music]

1218.559 --> 1223.6789999999999
someone said I don't know who the [ __ ]

1282.64 --> 1286.0800000000002
are they're

1286.88 --> 1293.3200000000002
trash like those are the guys that like

1290.799 --> 1295.84
used to be like the village scumbag

1293.32 --> 1297.08
trash that everybody hated and stayed

1295.84 --> 1299.8799999999999
away

1297.08 --> 1301.8799999999999
from cuz if they got involved they

1299.88 --> 1305.8400000000001
always get in fights because they're

1301.88 --> 1308.279
scumbag [ __ ] who manipulate like on

1305.84 --> 1311.559
a whim and they can't help it always

1308.279 --> 1313.36
have to [ __ ] around with people yeah and

1311.559 --> 1315.6399999999999
now they have the internet so now they

1313.36 --> 1318.6789999999999
can just pick out people out there to do

1315.64 --> 1324.279
that with YouTube just seems to [ __ ]

1318.679 --> 1324.279
love them they love scumbags over at

1324.44 --> 1329.039
YouTube they just keep all of them

1331.2 --> 1337.2
around why do you guys

1333.76 --> 1337.2
care who they

1346.96 --> 1349.96
are

1351.64 --> 1356.64
youd like to know who's who well it's

1354.4 --> 1359.4
not really going to matter I mean all of

1356.64 --> 1362.0
those names you mention are all troll

1359.4 --> 1364.96
scumbags like does it matter whether you

1362.0 --> 1367.52
face one troll or another or the one

1364.96 --> 1369.279
troll that actually turns out to be the

1367.52 --> 1371.6
other troll who gives a [ __ ] they're

1369.279 --> 1374.12
trolls they're all

1371.6 --> 1376.8799999999999
scumbags why the [ __ ] would you care

1374.12 --> 1376.8799999999999
which one is

1376.96 --> 1379.96
which

1382.91 --> 1386.1190000000001
[Music]

1391.73 --> 1397.069
[Music]

1399.88 --> 1404.64
yeah I like to get to the bottom of I

1401.52 --> 1408.08
get that but I mean it's not really good

1404.64 --> 1409.76
conversation for my show cuz there's no

1408.08 --> 1411.24
like you're not going to find out and if

1409.76 --> 1413.52
you really want to find it you have to

1411.24 --> 1416.76
do some digging around and see what

1413.52 --> 1418.52
happens be the arnian spy agency or

1416.76 --> 1420.72
whatever that way you can figure but

1418.52 --> 1423.279
there's no point in speculating about

1420.72 --> 1423.279
that in the

1425.4 --> 1429.64
chat just gives them more

1436.88 --> 1444.7990000000002
attention

1439.4 --> 1444.799
yeah exactly let do let's change the

1445.12 --> 1448.9189999999999
subject about what

1466.799 --> 1469.799
though

1471.48 --> 1476.6
boulder dash yeah but there's not really

1474.08 --> 1481.52
much to talk about

1476.6 --> 1483.6399999999999
drer that's very funny but uh I have

1481.52 --> 1486.96
made a bit of a but like I'm starting

1483.64 --> 1490.6000000000001
like the the checks the most difficult

1486.96 --> 1493.279
ones Boulder checks God and I'm trying

1490.6 --> 1497.039
to figure out how do I arrange

1493.279 --> 1499.6
this so that if you have eventually a

1497.039 --> 1501.72
level where there like 50 Boulders

1499.6 --> 1504.799
hanging around that it's not going to

1501.72 --> 1507.64
crash because it has to like f like 50

1504.799 --> 1513.8799999999999
times every every

1507.64 --> 1516.24
cycle do like 20 checks 50 times like

1513.88 --> 1518.6000000000001
I'm trying to make it more efficient

1516.24 --> 1520.559
it's very difficult like this is I'm

1518.6 --> 1523.6789999999999
actually doing like programming

1520.559 --> 1525.76
complications now when I'm not even

1523.679 --> 1529.679
actually doing the programming yet I'm

1525.76 --> 1529.679
I'm just figuring it out theoretically

1530.919 --> 1537.0
H but I am writing it down so I'm

1534.279 --> 1539.679
working on it it's slowly it's tedious

1537.0 --> 1542.48
but it's like I got I just have to have

1539.679 --> 1544.3990000000001
one of them complete like completely

1542.48 --> 1547.08
complete with all the materials

1544.399 --> 1549.9189999999999
everything that's

1547.08 --> 1552.36
possible and then once I have that kind

1549.919 --> 1555.76
of thing done then I

1552.36 --> 1558.7199999999998
yeah somehow need to like get a little

1555.76 --> 1561.0
engine going

1558.72 --> 1563.76
and then test it like how that's

1561.0 --> 1565.919
actually going to work out or if it will

1563.76 --> 1568.8799999999999
like grow like basically break the

1565.919 --> 1572.44
engine down like stall it so much that

1568.88 --> 1572.44
it's just not going to

1586.6 --> 1591.1589999999999
work

1589.559 --> 1592.039
let's what did the whole stream about

1591.159 --> 1595.279
the

1592.039 --> 1595.279
trolls oh

1599.52 --> 1605.039
wow is usually yeah look at yourself zap

1607.6 --> 1614.6789999999999
tappy don't know if he is

1611.559 --> 1618.0
though I mean flat it's mostly just

1614.679 --> 1620.72
really easy going like he'll go anywhere

1618.0 --> 1622.919
it doesn't really care but to call that

1620.72 --> 1625.32
being easily manipulated that's

1622.919 --> 1625.3200000000002
something

1638.039 --> 1644.32
else I mean flat side is not like a

1640.84 --> 1646.36
complete fool so I

1644.32 --> 1649.52
disagree Zep tap you don't know where

1646.36 --> 1649.52
you're getting that from

1651.76 --> 1656.08
maybe from the mirror that's right in

1653.52 --> 1656.08
front of your

1663.64 --> 1669.72
face right also another subject I'm

1667.32 --> 1672.72
continuing watching this rayum series

1669.72 --> 1675.159
and I mean it's [ __ ] messed up man I

1672.72 --> 1679.1200000000001
mean that's just so there's things

1675.159 --> 1682.5590000000002
really really wrong with it

1679.12 --> 1686.32
there's like they do

1682.559 --> 1690.6
Ault suggestion [ __ ] in

1686.32 --> 1692.279
there really [ __ ] dark

1690.6 --> 1697.279
potentially it's like they're

1692.279 --> 1700.399
continually like insinuating super dark

1697.279 --> 1702.279
[ __ ] and like brushing it past like

1700.399 --> 1704.399
they're like they're occultly trying to

1702.279 --> 1706.519
place it see whether you're going to

1704.399 --> 1708.84
pick up on it and then like pretend

1706.519 --> 1710.84
basically like nothing happen there's

1708.84 --> 1714.24
all kinds of weird [ __ ] in that series I

1710.84 --> 1717.48
mean I'm like highly high level alert

1714.24 --> 1719.559
like there's something really really

1717.48 --> 1722.279
dark about that series and not in an

1719.559 --> 1725.6399999999999
entertaining way

1722.279 --> 1727.64
so keep you up to date but I'm like just

1725.64 --> 1730.519
there's just things really bad about

1727.64 --> 1732.519
this [ __ ] and like there's satanic stuff

1730.519 --> 1736.64
in

1732.519 --> 1739.84
it like about actual satanic magic where

1736.64 --> 1742.919
you literally get people killed or have

1739.84 --> 1746.1589999999999
to destroy something you love horrible

1742.919 --> 1749.76
things like I hate it whenever any kind

1746.159 --> 1752.6000000000001
of Seri or movie address it it's always

1749.76 --> 1754.8799999999999
terrible it's just immediately evil but

1752.6 --> 1758.1999999999998
they kind of play it off so weird like

1754.88 --> 1761.519
it's just oh no it's

1758.2 --> 1764.679
just just stuff they're talking

1761.519 --> 1767.159
about it's like oh yeah it's spooky

1764.679 --> 1768.279
it's there's something really deranged

1767.159 --> 1771.1200000000001
about about this

1768.279 --> 1773.44
series and about that character and I

1771.12 --> 1776.5189999999998
wonder if she's really like that in real

1773.44 --> 1779.3600000000001
life something really wrong about her

1776.519 --> 1783.36
just really really wrong not in an

1779.36 --> 1785.24
entertaining way so but I'm just like

1783.36 --> 1787.6399999999999
yeah I have to keep watching just to see

1785.24 --> 1791.039
how terrible it's going to end I mean

1787.64 --> 1791.039
this is got to end really

1791.48 --> 1796.32
terrible otherwise it's just a

1793.64 --> 1799.3200000000002
pretentious piece of [ __ ]

1796.32 --> 1799.32

I the problems there's so so many like

2004.96 --> 2010.72
cheap killer torture poror movies that

2007.799 --> 2012.519
are with jump scares and just that are

2010.72 --> 2016.039
just

2012.519 --> 2019.3990000000001
nasty I mean there's like interesting

um Insidious right Insidious

2035.96 --> 2041.799
series

2038.639 --> 2044.24
I like that like that's actually scary

2041.799 --> 2047.279
and it's not like only jump scare

2044.24 --> 2050.679
[ __ ] and it's like spooky actually

2047.279 --> 2053.24
spooky and fascinating like that's a a

2050.679 --> 2056.159
movie that I would still like say like

2053.24 --> 2059.52
yeah that's pretty cool horror

2056.159 --> 2061.7200000000003
movie yeah there weren't a lot of those

2059.52 --> 2064.839
around back then by the way it was just

2061.72 --> 2068.0
a lot of like just shock and Gore and

2064.839 --> 2071.2799999999997
just [ __ ] nasty [ __ ] cheap jump

2068.0 --> 2072.599
scares yeah there's a lot of that

2071.28 --> 2076.52
especially in the

2072.599 --> 2076.52
9s and in the early

2077.24 --> 2083.04
2000s all

2079.639 --> 2085.079
[ __ ] it's all just reviewing material

2083.04 --> 2087.52
for for internet

2085.079 --> 2089.8390000000004
reviewers that remove shitty movies

2087.52 --> 2092.72
that's what that's

2089.839 --> 2094.72
for it's the only thing it's for so that

2092.72 --> 2097.3999999999996
they can review it so you don't have to

2094.72 --> 2100.1189999999997
watch it and then you can still get a

2097.4 --> 2100.119
chuckle out of

2107.48 --> 2114.52
it yeah no [ __ ] zap tappy why do you

2110.16 --> 2114.52
think I'm erasing the name

2122.52 --> 2128.8
bro I know terrible movies out there

2128.839 --> 2132.0789999999997
and I keep it to

2134.4 --> 2139.4
myself and I try to forget that they

2137.0 --> 2144.68
exist so that I don't have to be

2139.4 --> 2144.6800000000003
burdened by that crap and no one else

2153.2 --> 2157.3999999999996
either all right so yeah you want to see

2156.0 --> 2160.52
a good and

2157.4 --> 2162.7200000000003
interesting horror franchise series go

2160.52 --> 2166.4
and watch the Insidious ones there's a

2162.72 --> 2166.3999999999996
new one too I heard by the

2168.92 --> 2174.359
way it's getting although they are kind

2171.56 --> 2177.48
of just making it really

2174.359 --> 2180.2
weird so but like the first three were

2177.48 --> 2180.2
like super

2180.96 --> 2186.92
impressive I love it when they do that

2183.52 --> 2190.599
sort of thing but uh yeah I like that

2186.92 --> 2193.319
one let's see what there are good horror

2190.599 --> 2195.76
movie franchise and franchises and

2193.319 --> 2200.079
series and movies singular movies out

2195.76 --> 2200.079
there you just got to dig very

2215.68 --> 2218.68
carefully

2219.4 --> 2225.44
right and I reviewed some even like on

2221.76 --> 2229.8
this show like Netflix series and all

2225.44 --> 2233.2000000000003
that there are some really cool spooky

2229.8 --> 2233.2000000000003
series was it

2237.72 --> 2244.839
like what's the name

2241.2 --> 2248.5989999999997
again like archive 81 for example that

2244.839 --> 2248.599
thing was really freaking spooky

2250.04 --> 2255.52
remember

2252.319 --> 2258.599
that like that's that's well done that's

2255.52 --> 2260.72
scary but it's like it doesn't just

2258.599 --> 2264.96
normalize

2260.72 --> 2264.9599999999996
evil it's just really freaking

2265.64 --> 2272.48
spooky post oh my

2268.44 --> 2274.839
God Len lenx you really suck dude when

2272.48 --> 2277.68

2377.0 --> 2383.76
awesome and

2379.76 --> 2383.76

oh and you like a spooky movie like The

2407.72 --> 2413.48
Ninth

Gate that one always like but it's

2413.48 --> 2417.359
because it's like dark but it's just not

2415.4 --> 2421.96
a lot happens in it but it's just really

2417.359 --> 2421.96
dark and it's spooky and satanists

2425.359 --> 2430.52
and

2427.599 --> 2430.52
it's like soft

2430.68 --> 2436.56
horror more like a mystery thriller but

2433.68 --> 2439.56
I mean I like that

2436.56 --> 2441.359
one I mean not really like it every now

2439.56 --> 2444.44

2444.44 --> 2448.319

2496.32 --> 2499.349
[Music]

2511.64 --> 2518.24
movie and definitely don't watch the new

sucks they live yeah yeah yeah yeah but

2529.16 --> 2533.96
that's not a horror movie though that's

2530.599 --> 2533.96
just science fiction but it's

2541.2 --> 2549.5589999999997
awesome two girls climb a tower oh

thanks

2575.16 --> 2580.2799999999997

2577.24 --> 2582.24
the fog it's one of his best I never

2580.28 --> 2585.2400000000002
remember that

2582.24 --> 2587.5989999999997
one I really liked Big Trouble in Little

2585.24 --> 2590.04
China or little trouble big no Big

2587.599 --> 2591.559
Trouble in Little China that one was

2590.04 --> 2594.44
like

2591.559 --> 2596.48
surreal like I don't even fully remember

2594.44 --> 2599.119
what the [ __ ] happened in it except that

2596.48 --> 2601.48
it was really

2599.119 --> 2604.92
surreal I should watch it again just to

2601.48 --> 2604.92
see what the hell it was about

2605.079 --> 2608.079
again

2610.64 --> 2614.5989999999997
but John Carpenter is like one of my

2612.4 --> 2618.8
favorite 20th Century Movie

2614.599 --> 2620.44
Makers is so many good ones like that's

2618.8 --> 2623.319
really special

2620.44 --> 2627.16
like so many good

2623.319 --> 2628.96
ones and it's all relatively cheap and

2627.16 --> 2633.2
it's just incredible that somebody was

2628.96 --> 2633.2
able to do that what a

2635.079 --> 2638.079
visionary

2646.24 --> 2651.9199999999996
Barbarian I don't know don't remember

2649.2 --> 2651.9199999999996
that blue build

2665.0 --> 2668.0
evolution

2680.96 --> 2685.92
right hope you're all entertained here

2683.88 --> 2689.7200000000003
talking about movies I

2685.92 --> 2692.04
guess also to quickly like move out of

2689.72 --> 2694.5589999999997
memory what Len Lenox brought up I mean

2692.04 --> 2697.04
Len don't ever do that again please and

2694.559 --> 2699.2400000000002
in general I advise you to to never ever

2697.04 --> 2704.079
do that like people will [ __ ] hate

2699.24 --> 2704.0789999999997
you for bringing that kind of thing up

2704.26 --> 2709.0
[Music]

2705.88 --> 2713.0
okay it will make them designate you as

2709.0 --> 2717.839
oh that guy you don't want to be that

2713.0 --> 2717.839
guy so just don't do that again

2718.77 --> 2722.579
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
please

2733.28 --> 2740.3590000000004
Escape From New York was great

2736.4 --> 2743.52
eh it was very interesting

2740.359 --> 2745.96
mostly like it was just a pure concept

2743.52 --> 2748.24
movie I mean what happened in it was not

2745.96 --> 2750.64
super riveting at all it was just as a

2748.24 --> 2754.8799999999997
concept movie was really

2750.64 --> 2757.8799999999997
[Music]

2754.88 --> 2757.88
fascinating

2775.599 --> 2778.88
hey MMA good to see

2784.8 --> 2787.8
you

2814.8 --> 2817.8

2904.64 --> 2907.64
happened

2931.24 --> 2933.8799999999997
chat right

2934.599 --> 2937.599
now

2940.44 --> 2944.799
right so yeah it seems like we're mostly

2942.16 --> 2944.799
talking about

2964.52 --> 2968.559
movies and I'm getting

2978.72 --> 2987.48

though

3314.0 --> 3319.44
okay snow piercer was great you

3324.0 --> 3330.359
think how many people praise that movie

3326.96 --> 3330.359
I thought it was just

3333.839 --> 3342.5589999999997
annoying it's like this like gross

3338.88 --> 3342.559
hallucination I didn't like

3346.92 --> 3352.52
it it's like snow piercer I don't know

3349.96 --> 3356.64
man like that movie just feels like it's

3352.52 --> 3358.81
on drugs like the movie itself is

3356.64 --> 3361.9089999999997
I don't like

3358.81 --> 3361.909
[Music]

3368.37 --> 3372.5299999999997
[Music]

3372.799 --> 3381.52
it I think I didn't even finish watching

3377.64 --> 3385.0789999999997
it it's just that it got so hyped up

3381.52 --> 3387.359
like snow piercer got so unbelievably

3385.079 --> 3390.3590000000004
hyped up that it just made me dislike

3387.359 --> 3392.0389999999998
the movie before I had even watched it I

3390.359 --> 3394.64
mean when that happens right when things

3392.039 --> 3395.7990000000004
get really hyped up it literally makes

3394.64 --> 3398.16
me hate

3395.799 --> 3401.359
it cuz it means there's now a whole

3398.16 --> 3404.799
bunch of freaking gamas and just the

3401.359 --> 3406.88
worst people ever like it for some

3404.799 --> 3409.359
reason it's the only way it's going to

3406.88 --> 3409.359
be that

3413.88 --> 3416.88
popular

3425.72 --> 3431.1189999999997

that that movie

3466.599 --> 3471.599
exists it was really

3469.0 --> 3473.799
obscure it's also because of the style

3471.599 --> 3476.799
because it's so freaking

3473.799 --> 3476.799
Gothic

3479.67 --> 3486.92
[Music]

3482.52 --> 3489.7599999999998

way if you ever clicked on a video on

4183.12 --> 4185.759
you've seen

4187.44 --> 4194.12
it now if you've never ever went on the

4191.56 --> 4196.679
internet ever then there's 's a good

4194.12 --> 4199.08
chance you haven't seen it if you only

4196.679 --> 4202.2390000000005
watch television and

4199.08 --> 4204.96
stuff unless you also watch television

4202.239 --> 4208.44
in the 70s and then you probably also

4204.96 --> 4211.2390000000005
watched it or at least heard about it

4208.44 --> 4213.12
cuz it was on the British television on

4211.239 --> 4217.36
the BBC

4213.12 --> 4217.36
live they just played that

4218.0 --> 4226.48
series it's like the the first in

4221.96 --> 4228.8
yourface like mission of gigantic

4226.48 --> 4231.5599999999995
conspiracy like of all of it they

4228.8 --> 4234.28
basically admitted the Earth was flat

4231.56 --> 4236.280000000001
kind of thing like in everything that is

4234.28 --> 4240.96
all theater and how they do it and how

4236.28 --> 4240.96
they rig thing like in the freaking

4241.719 --> 4248.12
70s it's the first big

4245.239 --> 4249.839999999999
conspiracy admission

4248.12 --> 4252.64
Expos

4249.84 --> 4256.4800000000005
ever that was just played on the

4252.64 --> 4256.4800000000005
television just like

4262.52 --> 4268.6
that yeah how they get the news years in

4265.199 --> 4273.32
advance that's right it rolls out

4268.6 --> 4273.320000000001
everything everything it's

4273.4 --> 4279.96
crazy in the

4275.32 --> 4283.04
70s and so if you are into like

4279.96 --> 4286.6
conspiracy in any form it's like even oh

4283.04 --> 4289.0
kened assassination conspirac like any

4286.6 --> 4292.6
form you have probably heard about the

4289.0 --> 4294.6
news Benders you might not remember it

4292.6 --> 4297.360000000001
by name it's like what the hell are you

4294.6 --> 4300.320000000001
talking about new you'll see the clip

4297.36 --> 4302.799999999999
you'll remember CU every freaking person

4300.32 --> 4306.349999999999
that's ever watched a video on the

4302.8 --> 4312.27
internet has watched that by

4306.35 --> 4312.27
[Music]

4312.56 --> 4315.56
now

4326.0 --> 4329.8
is that the video Then by the

4330.0 --> 4338.52
way yeah it is right yeah that's

4334.6 --> 4341.56
it I mean that video has been seen so

4338.52 --> 4341.56
many times by

4342.48 --> 4347.919999999999
now

4345.199 --> 4349.919999999999
ohen benchman brought it up recently I

4347.92 --> 4352.12
yeah I

4349.92 --> 4355.36
mean you just got to be like a

4352.12 --> 4357.8
mainstream kind of numpty to be able to

4355.36 --> 4362.159
avoid watching

4357.8 --> 4365.52
this you got to be like oh no not a

4362.159 --> 4368.32
conspiracy you got to be like that to be

4365.52 --> 4371.719
capable of not having seen this right

4368.32 --> 4373.96
now cuz if you're not oh got a

4371.719 --> 4376.679
conspiracy nonsense

4373.96 --> 4380.4800000000005
where's your evidence yeah if you're not

4376.679 --> 4382.96
like that a [ __ ] gamma spaz

4380.48 --> 4386.08
denialist then there's just no way you

4382.96 --> 4386.08
haven't seen this right

4388.12 --> 4391.679
now Capricorn

4392.36 --> 4397.36
one

4394.08 --> 4400.8
yeah although news Benders was better

4397.36 --> 4404.36
though Capricorn one was just

4400.8 --> 4406.1990000000005
weird and interesting it was interesting

4404.36 --> 4407.58
but it was also just as a movie it was

4406.199 --> 4410.679999999999
kind of

4407.58 --> 4410.68
[Music]

4422.44 --> 4428.719
weird yeah there Al all whole line of

4425.52 --> 4428.719
these types of conspiracy

4432.36 --> 4435.36
movies

4436.639 --> 4442.1990000000005
like there's a library of conspiracy

4439.0 --> 4445.6
movies like from the 20th

4442.199 --> 4448.839999999999
century and that people just like they

4445.6 --> 4448.84
just kind of forgot about

4448.96 --> 4455.32
it but if you watch them back then

4452.32 --> 4455.32
you'll be like

4456.08 --> 4462.28
whoa like what the

4458.719 --> 4464.4800000000005
[ __ ] that

4462.28 --> 4466.36
happened

4464.48 --> 4469.199
and Capricorn one is like one of those

4466.36 --> 4472.92
it's like what

4469.199 --> 4475.44
really okay that slip by I guess nobody

4472.92 --> 4475.4400000000005
noticed

4477.08 --> 4481.36
that like and they live is kind of also

4479.679 --> 4484.04
one of those but they live has become

4481.36 --> 4487.4
really popular

4484.04 --> 4488.679
so most people by now also know what

4487.4 --> 4491.96
they live

4488.679 --> 4494.0
is cuz it's just been like used as like

4491.96 --> 4498.44
a stereotypical

4494.0 --> 4500.32
Banner for the conspiracy theory people

4498.44 --> 4503.96
like on their

4500.32 --> 4506.84
side not as to like ridicule

4503.96 --> 4510.88
them could you imagine

4506.84 --> 4515.159000000001
that like mainstream news readers and

4510.88 --> 4519.159000000001
CNN would just like oh oh no not more of

4515.159 --> 4523.08
those they live people oh yes we're all

4519.159 --> 4525.199
secretly aliens oh could you imagine

4523.08 --> 4525.199
that

4530.88 --> 4536.6
oh I mean at this point why not you know

4534.36 --> 4538.159
they could just do that as in why not

4536.6 --> 4541.280000000001
it's just

4538.159 --> 4543.5199999999995
that they probably they they're so low

4541.28 --> 4545.08
energy all these news reader types out

4543.52 --> 4547.400000000001
there they're so low energy they

4545.08 --> 4549.84
probably couldn't even get it out

4547.4 --> 4552.839999999999
naturally but I mean if they'd all be

4549.84 --> 4554.8
like oh yeah you're not one of those

4552.84 --> 4558.6
daily live people are

4554.8 --> 4561.52
you yeah you know not all news readers

4558.6 --> 4564.8
are aliens I mean that would be freaking

4561.52 --> 4564.8
funny wouldn't

4567.92 --> 4573.32
it you haven't seen they what the [ __ ]

4571.4 --> 4576.5599999999995
Planet are you

4573.32 --> 4579.5199999999995

4581.08 --> 4590.12

4590.92 --> 4598.4
movie number two being soil in

4595.159 --> 4602.679
green like how did you manage to not see

4598.4 --> 4602.679

4605.199 --> 4612.08
that slowmo moon buggy just put on the

4609.56 --> 4615.360000000001
damn

4612.08 --> 4617.5599999999995
glasses don't tell me what to do I'm

4615.36 --> 4622.239
putting on not putting on the damn

4617.56 --> 4622.2390000000005
glasses put on the

4622.28 --> 4626.639

glasses you'll know what that means soon

4633.2 --> 4638.639
[Music]

4634.639 --> 4640.92
enough yeah exactly best fight scene I

4638.639 --> 4644.2390000000005
mean so epic and these guys are pretty

4640.92 --> 4647.52
damn buff too like they really

4644.239 --> 4647.5199999999995
that looked like a serious

4653.08 --> 4657.0
fight I gotta watch that movie again

4655.679 --> 4659.53
it's

4657.0 --> 4661.239
great and the music's cool

4659.53 --> 4665.36
[Music]

4661.239 --> 4665.36
too it's such a concept

4672.0 --> 4675.0
movie

4676.48 --> 4683.799999999999
have an aversion to WWF people it's not

4679.639 --> 4683.8
going to bother you here it's

4685.6 --> 4689.76
great they don't act very

4690.88 --> 4695.52
WWF gate is a pretty good actor in

4701.92 --> 4706.2390000000005
it

4704.4 --> 4709.638999999999
good yeah get back to me

4706.239 --> 4713.599999999999
man I really don't understand how you've

4709.639 --> 4713.6
managed to elude

4715.52 --> 4720.56
that I mean that movie's been there for

4718.56 --> 4723.159000000001
like 50 years or

4720.56 --> 4727.360000000001
something how the hell did you avoid

4723.159 --> 4731.44
seeing that seriously that's

4727.36 --> 4734.639
weird anyway I guess it's because of the

4731.44 --> 4736.839999999999
the wrestling people

4734.639 --> 4738.639
that you avoid it but it's really not

4736.84 --> 4740.719
about that at all it's not like it's

4738.639 --> 4744.08
Hulk Hogan in or something don't worry

4740.719 --> 4747.2390000000005
about it you won't even think of of

4744.08 --> 4747.239
wrestling at

4748.28 --> 4753.4
all you haven't yeah but you're a crab
