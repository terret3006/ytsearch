[Music]

334.7 --> 340.34
[Music]

336.12 --> 340.34000000000003
you should go out in open areas yeah

342.66 --> 349.22

345.0 --> 349.22
really safe for against Earthquakes

361.58 --> 366.56
anyway glad everything went all right

[Music]

379.56 --> 385.02
yeah nothing that eventful happened here

382.16 --> 387.84000000000003
and we never get earthquakes there's

385.02 --> 391.139
like some very very mild tremors

387.84 --> 393.9
in the southernmost province

391.139 --> 395.759
where it's also a bit more mountainish

393.9 --> 397.73999999999995
hillish

395.759 --> 400.74
there's some minor Tremors over there

397.74 --> 403.139
sometimes but like further north

400.74 --> 407.479
into the riverlands never there's never

403.139 --> 407.479
a single Tremor which just never happens

412.04 --> 415.209
[Music]

421.6 --> 424.98900000000003
[Music]

430.139 --> 433.139

434.819 --> 438.62
hey Richard G good to see you

442.37 --> 446.099
[Music]

443.699 --> 447.45
seems my YouTube's working just fine

446.099 --> 450.65999999999997
today

447.45 --> 450.65999999999997
[Music]

452.22 --> 455.90000000000003
no video glitches

464.72 --> 470.36
right so yeah let's check out what I was

467.699 --> 470.36
doing yesterday

472.199 --> 474.74
foreign

484.08 --> 487.21999999999997
[Music]

489.18 --> 494.58
it didn't last very long but we did hang

491.58 --> 496.62
around afterwards just chatting oh yeah

494.58 --> 499.639
again a bunch of people were deleted

496.62 --> 499.639
from my uh

500.099 --> 505.55
from my channel and oh yeah I did

502.62 --> 507.66
actually hang around

505.55 --> 509.879
[Music]

507.66 --> 512.099
somebody did get deleted and there was

509.879 --> 515.12
no notification even in like the chat

512.099 --> 518.5390000000001
that was left a long time afterwards so

515.12 --> 518.539
whatever's going on

520.8 --> 527.779
uh yeah there's nothing that I get

523.56 --> 527.779
can do to find any trace of it

532.38 --> 537.66
all right so let's check the block list

535.68 --> 540.8
if maybe nobody's showing up because

537.66 --> 540.8
they're all banned

542.82 --> 547.6800000000001
people without ranches that is like

544.86 --> 550.98
Eevee doesn't like get banned every time

547.68 --> 552.899
but then sometimes she does

550.98 --> 555.14
oh wait was she got a wrench now doesn't

552.899 --> 555.14
she

558.3 --> 564.779
right but I gotta check my block lists

560.58 --> 567.36
like every day multiple times sometimes

564.779 --> 570.8
because people continually

567.36 --> 570.8000000000001
just get erased

571.74 --> 575.54
without me even knowing about it

598.68 --> 604.2199999999999
there's also names in here that I don't

600.779 --> 604.22
even remember ever seeing

604.86 --> 610.14
but it could be like pop-up socks that

608.279 --> 612.06
like in the middle of oh I'm getting

610.14 --> 613.74
angry about something and then they

612.06 --> 616.1999999999999
suddenly choose to say something and

613.74 --> 619.019
it's very annoying yeah then I just kick

616.2 --> 620.76
you out they don't even take a look

619.019 --> 624.12
that's the moment you're going to speak

620.76 --> 626.76
up well then this show is not for you

624.12 --> 630.12
nah I don't have anybody banned that

626.76 --> 631.9399999999999
should be banned all right

630.12 --> 636.0600000000001
hmm

631.94 --> 638.399
I've been handing wrenches too easily

636.06 --> 639.959
no more wrenches only race yeah but

638.399 --> 642.66
that's because I thought somebody was

639.959 --> 646.0999999999999
abusing them turret but if they aren't

642.66 --> 646.1
that's not what's happening

647.88 --> 651.8
that's why I said that originally

652.019 --> 658.26
but yeah nobody that has a wrench in my

655.98 --> 660.3000000000001
channel can actually ban people without

658.26 --> 662.8389999999999
any kind of notification of somebody

660.3 --> 668.399
being hidden showing up

662.839 --> 670.62
right like as I'm doing the show

668.399 --> 671.76
like somebody chatting with me right

670.62 --> 673.8
there in the chat suddenly they're

671.76 --> 676.62
banned without anything show up nobody

673.8 --> 679.1999999999999
that has a wrench in my chat

676.62 --> 682.62
can do that

679.2 --> 684.24
so it's not the ranches it isn't

682.62 --> 686.16
hey and at least

684.24 --> 688.4590000000001
when they get wrenches it doesn't happen

686.16 --> 688.459
anymore

689.279 --> 693.079
did Aries show up yesterday yeah

697.62 --> 702.14
he did the longest time out what

707.76 --> 711.6
or somebody was doing the timeout

709.62 --> 712.36
testing right

711.6 --> 715.409
I don't remember

712.36 --> 715.409
[Music]

720.839 --> 727.1
right anyhow uh fed

724.2 --> 727.1
it's a bit short

727.44 --> 733.6400000000001
QE live

730.079 --> 733.64
was typical

737.519 --> 740.839
she even had a bunch of videos

741.66 --> 744.98
that I watched this time

746.16 --> 748.8199999999999
what else

750.0 --> 754.14
oh yeah watching this new series on

752.16 --> 757.399
Netflix so it's like I don't even know

754.14 --> 757.399
what to think about it yet

758.22 --> 763.8000000000001
uh

760.2 --> 766.139
don't even remember what it's called

763.8 --> 768.92
but it's sort of like a spooky series

766.139 --> 768.92
thing again

772.56 --> 776.16
and the first few episodes were or well

774.899 --> 779.16
the first

776.16 --> 781.56
it just seemed like really really

779.16 --> 784.5
pretentious

781.56 --> 786.3
but the mystery like it's a mystery it's

784.5 --> 791.1
not even like a spooky thing it's more

786.3 --> 792.779
like a mystery with spooky traits

791.1 --> 795.6
but it's getting really interesting

792.779 --> 798.899
though it's not like oh Supernatural

795.6 --> 801.12
things all over the place in CGI no it's

798.899 --> 804.18
more subtle than that

801.12 --> 806.1
but it like yeah

804.18 --> 808.579
I mean the main character is so freaking

806.1 --> 808.5790000000001
liberal

809.579 --> 815.8389999999999
but not like

811.459 --> 815.8389999999999
expressive about it's just so typical

817.92 --> 821.06
it's a woman

821.1 --> 826.8000000000001
she does play like

823.74 --> 828.6
cello even in the series that and that

826.8 --> 830.2199999999999
is kind of interesting what the [ __ ] is

828.6 --> 833.4590000000001
it called

830.22 --> 836.4200000000001
let's see if I got a 5k where is it oh

833.459 --> 836.42
yeah requiem

838.86 --> 843.54
but yeah it's getting more interesting

841.019 --> 846.42
I'm like an episode

843.54 --> 851.459
three or four

846.42 --> 851.459
but the first few was like oh really

855.48 --> 859.21
okay let's see hey hello Oz good to see

858.48 --> 866.289
you

859.21 --> 866.289
[Music]

867.899 --> 873.54
there was QE live yes yeah as always

870.18 --> 876.5999999999999
every Tuesday Richard G don't you know

873.54 --> 880.8199999999999
every Tuesday the same time

876.6 --> 880.82
that's like nine o'clock Amsterdam time

883.079 --> 887.459
I don't know how you keep missing them

884.579 --> 889.8
if you just subscribe to Quantum eraser

887.459 --> 893.959
Channel and hit the Bell notification it

889.8 --> 893.959
you do get it does work

894.779 --> 899.959
does with me at least oh no come on

902.3 --> 905.779
lawnmower guy

906.72 --> 911.36
you really have to do that right now

911.459 --> 914.459
ah

921.6 --> 927.24
oh hello moon rover and you're

924.6 --> 930.44
heliocentric assumptions about tectonic

927.24 --> 930.44
plates that's cute

931.56 --> 936.9799999999999
there's no proof that there's plates

933.54 --> 936.98
drifting on anything though

939.959 --> 947.169
hey Evie good to you

943.35 --> 947.169
[Music]

948.0 --> 953.0
never get QE live that's weird

955.44 --> 959.45
well in that case Richard you just have

957.6 --> 962.6
to set your alarm clock

959.45 --> 966.36
[Music]

962.6 --> 968.76
but usually he goes Live While flat side

966.36 --> 970.8000000000001
goes live or a bit like flat side always

968.76 --> 972.98
like goes live at that hour too for some

970.8 --> 972.9799999999999
reason

974.1 --> 979.16
are those plates curved

976.399 --> 982.72
oh plates are curved

979.16 --> 984.8389999999999
yes that should work or something

982.72 --> 989.1800000000001
[Music]

984.839 --> 989.1800000000001
so they're curved and they're drifting

994.019 --> 997.079
I don't understand how that's supposed

995.76 --> 1000.199
to work

997.079 --> 1004.04
like actually function

1000.199 --> 1006.8599999999999
that's drifting or it's like loose

1004.04 --> 1010.9399999999999
and it's floating then wouldn't there be

1006.86 --> 1013.72
like capsizing situations and all that

1010.94 --> 1013.72
you know

1013.94 --> 1020.5600000000001
since the actual solid shape of it is

1017.899 --> 1020.56
curved

1020.839 --> 1025.52
I mean you're not gonna have any like

1022.88 --> 1027.74
flat plates

1025.52 --> 1029.54
sticking out or like

1027.74 --> 1031.699
getting wonky

1029.54 --> 1035.6789999999999
right

1031.699 --> 1035.679
like you have with curved plates

1039.679 --> 1044.179
curved plates there's going to be

1041.299 --> 1048.1
capsizing in situations all right so

1044.179 --> 1048.1000000000001
pushing against one another so

1048.439 --> 1053.9
what if a plate on one side gets like

1051.44 --> 1055.94
something supposedly gets underneath

1053.9 --> 1058.1000000000001
there right there the in geology like to

1055.94 --> 1059.74
say that like all the plate is moving

1058.1 --> 1063.9189999999999
under and oh

1059.74 --> 1065.419
so yeah that's a plate that's like a

1063.919 --> 1068.48
curved clay

1065.419 --> 1070.5200000000002
something is pushing like under it

1068.48 --> 1072.2
wouldn't that mean that the other side

1070.52 --> 1075.1399999999999
of the plate would like

1072.2 --> 1078.28
capsize the other way

1075.14 --> 1078.2800000000002
isn't it solid

1078.44 --> 1082.66
it's also messy

1083.12 --> 1089.7399999999998
I don't even think there's any plates

1086.179 --> 1093.2
I think it's more like roots

1089.74 --> 1094.94
like pillars that are stuck and there's

1093.2 --> 1097.46
friction in between the pillars because

1094.94 --> 1099.14
they can technically move separate from

1097.46 --> 1101.179
one another and then where they where

1099.14 --> 1102.8600000000001
there's friction in between

1101.179 --> 1106.179
that's

1102.86 --> 1106.1789999999999
where lava happens

1113.44 --> 1119.8690000000001
[Music]

1126.559 --> 1130.72
oh God hello Phil Bell

1131.36 --> 1138.74
the blades exist oh yes they exist

1136.82 --> 1142.34
feel well

1138.74 --> 1144.559
yeah there's no plates

1142.34 --> 1147.9189999999999
the plate would mean that there's that

1144.559 --> 1150.08
it's like drifting on something

1147.919 --> 1153.74
floating

1150.08 --> 1156.6789999999999
it isn't there's nothing underneath us

1153.74 --> 1159.14
on which it is floating

1156.679 --> 1160.76
it's all solid

1159.14 --> 1162.44
yeah there's lava here and there

1160.76 --> 1163.8799999999999
somewhere

1162.44 --> 1167.1200000000001
but

1163.88 --> 1170.419
it's not drift it's not floating on lava

1167.12 --> 1171.62
or a molten iron core

1170.419 --> 1173.179
right

1171.62 --> 1175.6999999999998
that's not happening you have no

1173.179 --> 1180.64
evidence for that

1175.7 --> 1180.64
and besides you should all feel lucky

1180.679 --> 1185.26
that that's not the case because

1182.24 --> 1190.419
otherwise you would have like potential

1185.26 --> 1190.419
tectonic plate capsizing situations

1197.0 --> 1203.36
right so just think of it like this you

1200.48 --> 1207.02
have a little pool there or like a

1203.36 --> 1210.02
whatever very little swimming pool and

1207.02 --> 1212.4189999999999
you have pieces of wood like flat pieces

1210.02 --> 1213.98
of wood

1212.419 --> 1216.44
that are like

1213.98 --> 1218.0
floating of course because wood is less

1216.44 --> 1219.74
dense and there's air in between it and

1218.0 --> 1221.36
all that so it's going to float on that

1219.74 --> 1223.28
water and then I have all these pieces

1221.36 --> 1225.5
of wood and and like you make it you

1223.28 --> 1227.0
puzzle it out that it kind of fits there

1225.5 --> 1229.7
might be some gaps here and there but it

1227.0 --> 1233.0
kind of fits together right what happens

1229.7 --> 1235.46
when you start pushing those wooden

1233.0 --> 1238.179
plates on the water against one another

1235.46 --> 1238.179
what happens

1239.24 --> 1242.44
they uh

1246.02 --> 1252.16
yeah that's what happens yeah they don't

1249.86 --> 1257.36
go

1252.16 --> 1257.3600000000001
no no they capsize

1257.539 --> 1261.82
yeah floating plates did you push

1260.72 --> 1265.6000000000001
together

1261.82 --> 1265.6
they capsize

1266.12 --> 1271.76
because there's it's liquid it's on

1268.46 --> 1274.22
liquid the liquid can move there's

1271.76 --> 1276.3799999999999
pressures rearranging itself the liquid

1274.22 --> 1283.22
will move with it

1276.38 --> 1283.22
and then the plate will end up capsizing

1283.82 --> 1288.559
that's not happening here on Earth is it

1287.0 --> 1290.96
ever

1288.559 --> 1292.94
there's no oh yeah we got the over there

1290.96 --> 1296.2
yeah they had a tectonic activity got

1292.94 --> 1299.059
really heavy uh a few deck a few

1296.2 --> 1302.659
Millennia ago and that's why the country

1299.059 --> 1306.08
is like a a plate that's just diagonally

1302.659 --> 1308.179
there it's capsized

1306.08 --> 1309.08
and there's volcanic activity at the top

1308.179 --> 1311.24
side

1309.08 --> 1312.98
um coming out on the side of it right

1311.24 --> 1314.9
because it's all stuck up and there's

1312.98 --> 1317.539
all this room where all this

1314.9 --> 1318.3200000000002
molten iron car magma can just seep

1317.539 --> 1322.1
through

1318.32 --> 1324.2
this volcanic activity at on the uh on

1322.1 --> 1326.299
the outside of the

1324.2 --> 1327.98
the capsized plate and on the other side

1326.299 --> 1330.3799999999999
is like deep and there's like a new

1327.98 --> 1334.039
ocean there

1330.38 --> 1338.8600000000001
like no no that's not anywhere

1334.039 --> 1338.86
because they're not floating plates

1339.559 --> 1346.059
floating solid plates that's not

1342.559 --> 1346.059
what the earth's surface is

1349.039 --> 1354.34
and there's no evidence that they are

1350.96 --> 1354.3400000000001
floating plates at all

do you know like earthquake guys like

geologists that like keep track of

that's what he is

1914.12 --> 1919.76
he's got all riled up because of my show

1916.58 --> 1921.6789999999999
apparently where I said that yeah

1919.76 --> 1924.74
uh

1921.679 --> 1927.02
Civil War imminent amount of people that

1924.74 --> 1931.039
are getting coming across

1927.02 --> 1934.8799999999999
H categories and that literally there

1931.039 --> 1938.899
are people yeah on Infowars

1934.88 --> 1942.7
saying like yeah there is like weird

1938.899 --> 1942.6999999999998
military training going on there

1943.399 --> 1948.86
it's all hyper suspicious

1945.86 --> 1950.899
and like the scale of it is like off the

1948.86 --> 1953.7199999999998
charts it's unseen

1950.899 --> 1956.1399999999999
like that kind of population migration

1953.72 --> 1959.299
is historically

1956.14 --> 1962.0800000000002
exclusively associated with the moving

1959.299 --> 1962.08
of armies

1962.12 --> 1967.1589999999999
yeah

1963.44 --> 1969.74
that's what that show was about but this

1967.159 --> 1972.5800000000002
guy can't have it because his body in

1969.74 --> 1976.539
the military doesn't say it's happening

1972.58 --> 1979.6399999999999
because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1976.539 --> 1982.7
like oh oh you have buddies in the

military that are illegal aliens do you

1982.7 --> 1990.46
or that train though specifically oh no

1986.059 --> 1990.46
oh well then shut the [ __ ] up

1991.039 --> 1996.98
but you think every U.S soldier in the

1994.1 --> 1999.9189999999999
world is now currently going to the

border to help train migrants you're a

1999.919 --> 2004.2990000000002
[ __ ] [ __ ] you need to shut the [ __ ]

2002.26 --> 2008.019

2012.64 --> 2016.74
you take your shots and shut the [ __ ] up

yeah he was really triggered probably

2023.98 --> 2027.76
still is now I don't care there's

2026.14 --> 2031.779
nothing he can do

2027.76 --> 2034.6
you see I can say all those things

2031.779 --> 2037.6
there's nothing he can do about it I'm

2034.6 --> 2040.48
sure he trying

2037.6 --> 2042.8799999999999
it's just a whiny sniveling gamma

2067.3 --> 2072.52
well it was nice for him to show up so I

anti-flatter I think he's just some

2089.32 --> 2093.3990000000003
whiny little leftist that happened to

2091.899 --> 2095.6189999999997
bump into this

saying and then trigger mode

2099.46 --> 2107.14

2102.94 --> 2110.08

I'm sure he does great in face-to-face

2128.02 --> 2133.18

2130.48 --> 2137.079
but uh yeah judging who people are on

2133.18 --> 2139.1189999999997
the internet uh no definitely not his

2137.079 --> 2143.28
strong point

2139.119 --> 2143.28
especially when he gets agitated

2145.32 --> 2151.1400000000003
so I wouldn't mind too much seriously

2168.22 --> 2174.5789999999997
Celestial navigation is not about

2170.56 --> 2177.06
solving a right angled triangle uh yeah

2174.579 --> 2177.0600000000004
it is

2185.859 --> 2191.0789999999997
very very wrong or maybe you're really

2189.099 --> 2193.3
underneath all of it are a [ __ ]

2195.64 --> 2200.02
Globe based missed information because

2197.92 --> 2202.2400000000002
you have very specific sources that want

you to specifically do that

2202.24 --> 2206.8199999999997
are you Evie are you an operator

how about you tell us if you're actually

2212.859 --> 2218.3199999999997
an operator

2214.66 --> 2219.8199999999997
that argues very specific type of

2218.32 --> 2224.46
information

2219.82 --> 2224.46
that is very specifically misinformation

2232.619 --> 2239.76
don't ask me [ __ ] questions answer

2235.9 --> 2239.76
the [ __ ] question Evie

2252.04 --> 2256.02
where the hell did you [ __ ] get that

2256.359 --> 2261.5789999999997
how the hell would you even know that

2258.88 --> 2263.619
or hear about that because you can't

2261.579 --> 2267.3590000000004
know that because it's not true

2263.619 --> 2267.359
where the hell did you even get that

2267.88 --> 2272.92
no suddenly now miss hang around

2270.52 --> 2276.88

2272.92 --> 2279.04
very very specific and you get it wrong

2276.88 --> 2282.1800000000003
yeah no wonder people thought that you

2279.04 --> 2282.18
were Phil Bell or something

2290.5 --> 2292.98
oh

2299.859 --> 2305.2799999999997
where are you getting that information

2301.66 --> 2305.2799999999997
from Evie

2317.32 --> 2324.0
you got it from doing Celestial

2319.599 --> 2324.0
navigation in seek Cadets oh really

2325.06 --> 2329.92
sure

2326.7 --> 2332.3199999999997
you got any sources for that

2329.92 --> 2335.38
like what what did you use yeah do you

2332.32 --> 2338.56
use any books is that just what they

2335.38 --> 2341.5
told you was it a pure verbal education

2341.5 --> 2349.0
that we'd like to know about that yeah

2345.22 --> 2352.1189999999997

2349.0 --> 2355.18
you got taught how to account for

2352.119 --> 2357.82
coriolis deviation as a sniper that's

2355.18 --> 2360.48
what it sounds like

2357.82 --> 2364.98
yeah that happens people get

2360.48 --> 2364.98
misinformed in the military

2366.64 --> 2369.2999999999997
that happens

people in my chat do elsewhere

2400.96 --> 2403.56
okay

2405.339 --> 2409.72

[ __ ] about me for hours and hours

2412.06 --> 2416.38
straight in other people's chat yeah you

2414.52 --> 2418.119

2416.38 --> 2420.7000000000003
pick up on that

2418.119 --> 2422.6800000000003
not saying that you're doing that

2420.7 --> 2426.839
but if you're gonna say really weird

2422.68 --> 2426.839

2459.52 --> 2464.46
but you did know how you didn't need

2464.5 --> 2468.96
you didn't need that one thing right

2469.839 --> 2477.4
you don't need a right angle triangle

2474.04 --> 2479.859
for Celestial navigation yeah you do you

2477.4 --> 2482.2000000000003
absolutely do

2479.859 --> 2485.2799999999997
you happen to remember that one [ __ ]

2539.74 --> 2544.18
do that but you just can't help yourself

2541.72 --> 2547.8999999999996
but make complete [ __ ] up out of nothing

2544.18 --> 2551.44
are you a pathological liar this is not

2547.9 --> 2554.1600000000003
like oh you're it is that actually a

2551.44 --> 2554.16
problem you have

2560.56 --> 2566.2599999999998
an almanac book and seek Cadets oh yes

2563.26 --> 2568.2400000000002
yes well Almanac but books

2566.26 --> 2570.2200000000003
that sort of stuff yeah

2568.24 --> 2572.74
do you have a sword can you source that

2570.22 --> 2575.3799999999997
why don't you Source it

Source it give me a link to that book

2575.38 --> 2579.88
online and I'll pass it on to 10th Man

2578.38 --> 2581.6800000000003
you can check it out

2579.88 --> 2583.7200000000003
yeah

2581.68 --> 2586.96
and we'll see

2583.72 --> 2589.18
if if you don't need a right angle

2586.96 --> 2592.98
triangle

2589.18 --> 2592.98
for Celestial navigation okay

2602.19 --> 2605.2490000000003
[Music]

2636.16 --> 2642.8799999999997
so Evie when you were doing uh the angle

2639.4 --> 2645.78
thing right yeah checking out a did you

2642.88 --> 2645.78
use the horizon

2646.599 --> 2650.7000000000003
The Horizon

2648.16 --> 2650.7
hmm

2652.96 --> 2660.7200000000003
yeah okay Evie

2656.26 --> 2660.7200000000003
did you use the Horizon in the process

2661.06 --> 2669.119
right seeing the horizon

2664.78 --> 2669.119
and the sun right or star

2677.26 --> 2681.4
yeah you used her yeah welcome yeah

2679.359 --> 2683.5
welcome to Flat Earth you used a right

2681.4 --> 2685.78
angle triangle

2683.5 --> 2690.359
yeah

2685.78 --> 2690.3590000000004
flat base line to the horizon

2694.48 --> 2700.119
so maybe in the future stop saying

2697.42 --> 2703.96
[ __ ] stupid things

2700.119 --> 2707.7400000000002
that play into ball-tarted thinking that

2703.96 --> 2709.78
makes people think that you're a troll

2707.74 --> 2713.04
because it's a very [ __ ] stupid thing

2709.78 --> 2713.0400000000004
to say that out of nowhere

2713.44 --> 2716.92
that why the [ __ ] would you even want to

2715.78 --> 2720.2200000000003
say that

2716.92 --> 2724.02
what is your dig like what are you

2720.22 --> 2724.02
getting out of it saying that

2725.319 --> 2730.18
you didn't use a triangle oh we only

2727.48 --> 2732.64
measured one angle yeah yeah off a flat

2730.18 --> 2736.44
Baseline you know what that is

2732.64 --> 2739.66
that's you the Observer it's the Horizon

2736.44 --> 2744.359
and it's a star yeah guess what that is

2739.66 --> 2744.359
that's a right angle triangle yes

2744.46 --> 2748.98
that's what that is

2746.14 --> 2748.98
dumbass

2758.92 --> 2761.04
um

2779.84 --> 2785.88
[Music]

2781.48 --> 2785.88
it looks like Evie is just [ __ ] dumb

2786.7 --> 2792.46
and she thought she would be cheeky or

2789.76 --> 2795.4
smart or something to say something like

2792.46 --> 2797.68
that which made people obviously made

2795.4 --> 2801.3
her think made them think that you were

2797.68 --> 2804.7599999999998
Phil Bell because Phil Bell would say

2801.3 --> 2809.26
deviant [ __ ] like that they have a use

2804.76 --> 2811.44
for saying deviant [ __ ] like that you

2809.26 --> 2811.44
don't

2811.66 --> 2817.8999999999996
you don't have that excuse

2815.2 --> 2819.64
do you Evie are you a ball [ __ ] are you

2817.9 --> 2821.619
secretly an anti-flat earther that's

2819.64 --> 2823.72
just being really not oh just a nice

2821.619 --> 2826.7200000000003
nice lady yeah I get a bit under

2823.72 --> 2828.16
people's fingernails sometimes get a bit

2826.72 --> 2831.7
whiny

2828.16 --> 2833.859
but are you an anti-flat earther

2831.7 --> 2836.04
why the [ __ ] would you even say such a

2833.859 --> 2836.04
thing

2844.599 --> 2849.099
did you get an invite from anti-flat

2847.24 --> 2851.9799999999996
earthers hey

2849.099 --> 2853.7200000000003
they say you need this oh oh yo no

2851.98 --> 2856.42
Evie's here to correct it all because

2853.72 --> 2859.54
she's had the teachings

2856.42 --> 2862.359
she was specifically taught how you

2859.54 --> 2865.119
don't need a right angle triangle for

2862.359 --> 2869.2
Celestial navigation from birth he was

2865.119 --> 2872.2000000000003
specifically trained were you Evie we

2869.2 --> 2874.2999999999997
specifically trained not to use

2872.2 --> 2877.18
that

2874.3 --> 2880.1800000000003
so that you have a lifelong story to

2877.18 --> 2884.7599999999998
contradict our one little argument

2880.18 --> 2884.7599999999998
really and we have to believe that

2888.7 --> 2892.319
I'm not trusting you anymore

2897.04 --> 2903.64
there's literally no reason in the world

2900.839 --> 2906.4
for anybody

2903.64 --> 2911.2799999999997
in your position what you're doing what

2906.4 --> 2911.28
you have been doing to come up with that

2911.7 --> 2916.6189999999997

right angle triangle for navigation

that's the most ludicrous approach I've

ever heard

why don't you actually go on fed today

3384.059 --> 3390.599
goes live in one hour why don't you go

3386.52 --> 3393.42
to the Discord and get on it

3390.599 --> 3396.599
and make your case make your case

3393.42 --> 3398.16
because I want you to go on there and

3396.599 --> 3402.78
make your case

3398.16 --> 3405.5989999999997
yeah if this is a real life actual life

3402.78 --> 3409.28
experience that you had then I want you

3405.599 --> 3409.28
to put it down right over there

3412.68 --> 3418.22
for all okay

3414.42 --> 3418.2200000000003
let's see how real that is

3425.76 --> 3429.96
let's better get your damn sources

3428.579 --> 3431.94
straight too

3429.96 --> 3435.359
and if you can't have sources then at

3431.94 --> 3438.18
least get some names straight

3435.359 --> 3440.819
yeah I mean if you still know the name

3438.18 --> 3442.98
of the book roughly the name

3440.819 --> 3444.7799999999997
even if you don't get it right you ask

3442.98 --> 3446.88
10th man it's a good chance that he'll

3444.78 --> 3449.1600000000003
just be able to pick it out out of all

3446.88 --> 3451.02
of the celestial Navigator navigation

3449.16 --> 3454.859
books that exist

3451.02 --> 3456.66
knowingly yeah because he keeps track of

3454.859 --> 3460.0789999999997
all of that [ __ ]

3456.66 --> 3462.74
so why did you prove your case

3460.079 --> 3462.7400000000002
huh

3475.68 --> 3479.5989999999997

oh really that happened when when did

3488.4 --> 3493.8
that in a chat yeah yeah that's chat

3490.92 --> 3496.26
Evie why don't you do it in the voice

3493.8 --> 3498.7200000000003
chat actually join the show verbally

3496.26 --> 3500.7000000000003
it's different as in chat

3498.72 --> 3502.2599999999998

you actually hear what you're talking

3502.26 --> 3504.5
about

3506.52 --> 3510.42

Evie when did you get in the voice chat

3521.819 --> 3527.0
what the [ __ ] are you talking about you

3523.799 --> 3527.0
never went in voice chat

3542.94 --> 3549.98
there were some girls I think a while

3546.24 --> 3549.9799999999996
ago that when was that you

3553.619 --> 3558.319
because there was a girl talking

3555.18 --> 3558.319
complete nonsense

3560.16 --> 3564.359
was that actually you I didn't think it

3562.26 --> 3568.7000000000003
was you

3564.359 --> 3568.7
then again I didn't really know you then

3569.819 --> 3575.64
did you like get in on voice chat before

3573.42 --> 3577.559
you started to really like get active in

3575.64 --> 3580.02
the chat with fed is that what happened

3577.559 --> 3583.099
I'm just trying to like figure out what

3580.02 --> 3583.099
the [ __ ] going on here

3583.799 --> 3588.78
and who you are if that's even like true

3586.799 --> 3591.98
you're just claiming that you've just

3588.78 --> 3591.98
been on with Nathan

3594.78 --> 3596.9
thank you

3624.839 --> 3630.299
oh no reply right oh okay

3627.78 --> 3633.3190000000004
well in that case maybe Nathan was just

3630.299 --> 3633.319
right about you then

3668.64 --> 3671.0589999999997
foreign

3688.079 --> 3694.2000000000003
no we don't need identification we don't

3691.14 --> 3696.44
need to see her identification just move

3694.2 --> 3696.4399999999996
along

3700.5 --> 3705.78
but uh

3702.359 --> 3707.819
I mean if she says she just went I don't

3705.78 --> 3710.3390000000004
even know exactly what that means a

3707.819 --> 3713.22
confrontation so is that a confrontation

3710.339 --> 3716.9
in the chat because Nathan can get

3713.22 --> 3716.8999999999996
pretty crude in the chat

3717.18 --> 3724.2599999999998
yep

3718.5 --> 3725.94
or were you on the voice chat in a show

3724.26 --> 3731.2200000000003
I remember

3725.94 --> 3733.619
a woman being on the show a while ago

3731.22 --> 3735.68
distinctly woman voice and then

3733.619 --> 3741.26
basically

3735.68 --> 3741.2599999999998
Nathan telling her off was that you

3743.52 --> 3745.7
foreign

3753.72 --> 3757.8799999999997
or maybe just a few weeks I don't

3755.7 --> 3757.8799999999997
remember

3760.799 --> 3766.38
or nothing

3763.14 --> 3769.4
maybe if it's just left whatever I'm

3766.38 --> 3769.4
done with this [ __ ]

3770.339 --> 3776.099
or maybe I just need to

3773.28 --> 3778.26
recheck my YouTube Studio again because

3776.099 --> 3782.0
it might have just

3778.26 --> 3782.0
banned her out of nothing again

3808.559 --> 3811.559
nope

3820.799 --> 3823.04
foreign

3845.099 --> 3850.26
get the woman on here

3847.14 --> 3852.5989999999997
why would I get the woman on here

3850.26 --> 3856.6400000000003
I'm not an expert to like have a

3852.599 --> 3856.6400000000003
conversation about Celestial navigation

3858.96 --> 3866.579
I mean I know roughly the basics like I

3862.92 --> 3869.339
get how it works I get why Flat Earth

3866.579 --> 3871.5
flat Baseline all those things it's just

3869.339 --> 3873.839
that I'm not super great at actually

3871.5 --> 3878.7
arguing it

3873.839 --> 3881.04
while over at fed I mean Nathan and

3878.7 --> 3883.9199999999996
intense men are like the greatest

3881.04 --> 3886.5
experts that I've ever heard of so

3883.92 --> 3890.52
and they would definitely know how to

3886.5 --> 3894.299
Source it and get it perfectly correct

3890.52 --> 3898.68
we don't have to prove anything oh

3894.299 --> 3902.48
and I am oh okay okay yeah yeah you

3898.68 --> 3902.48
leave that's right you [ __ ] leave

3902.819 --> 3908.88
me you're just wrong about celestronomy

3905.88 --> 3911.059
oh yeah right yeah get the [ __ ] out of

3908.88 --> 3911.059
here

3916.559 --> 3921.119
yeah and the next time you have a little

3918.54 --> 3923.04
run-in with Michael Khan I'll just give

3921.119 --> 3925.94
him the green light to [ __ ] ban you

3923.04 --> 3925.94
yeah

3933.48 --> 3936.079
oh

3936.79 --> 3939.88
[Music]

3940.02 --> 3943.619
it wasn't a [ __ ] you except happy that's

3942.42 --> 3947.1800000000003
not true

3943.619 --> 3947.1800000000003
what a bunch of hard [ __ ]

that's just a straighter I'm just gonna

3952.859 --> 3958.68
time you out proud fat

3956.339 --> 3960.54
what the [ __ ] is wrong I'm okay and now

3958.68 --> 3962.5789999999997
I'm not gonna time yet that's so [ __ ]

3960.54 --> 3965.099
[ __ ]

3962.579 --> 3966.2400000000002
oh my God I'm just gonna leave that

3965.099 --> 3970.0
because

3966.24 --> 3971.16
people have to read that

3970.0 --> 3973.799
[Music]

3971.16 --> 3977.18
just to be reminded that you're a

3973.799 --> 3977.18
[ __ ] ball tards that happy

3984.63 --> 3987.659
[Music]

3991.2 --> 3995.16
all right

3993.119 --> 3998.0
oh thank God I have plenty of other

3995.16 --> 3998.0
actual women

3998.52 --> 4002.5
not running out of them anytime soon

4005.26 --> 4011.26
yeah but I should learn to stop

4008.48 --> 4011.26
defending women

4016.28 --> 4021.92
I should just stop doing that

4019.22 --> 4024.68
I have this tendency you see

4021.92 --> 4027.02
does this weird Chevrolet's nature if I

4024.68 --> 4030.74
see somebody that definitely seems like

4027.02 --> 4031.88
a woman because I'm not like trans or

4030.74 --> 4034.5789999999997
what is it what do you call that

4031.88 --> 4036.5
transphobic is that trans where you

4034.579 --> 4038.2400000000002
think like every freaking woman is

4036.5 --> 4041.74
actually a guy pretending to be a woman

4038.24 --> 4041.74
yeah I don't have that fear

4042.92 --> 4047.14
but I am very chivalrous in nature

4050.059 --> 4056.799
but then it's this

4053.359 --> 4056.799
it's this horseshit

4062.48 --> 4069.64
hey so you can start yeah

4065.359 --> 4069.64
you're living on a sailboat for 15 years

4071.42 --> 4075.92
and she just stood by her point no you

4074.059 --> 4078.52
don't need a right angle Drive

4075.92 --> 4078.52
foreign

4078.92 --> 4083.48
the [ __ ] is wrong with you like are you

4081.319 --> 4086.2599999999998
mentally ill

4083.48 --> 4086.26
Evie

4087.079 --> 4090.7000000000003
or are you just a plant

4107.42 --> 4112.9
oh

4109.339 --> 4112.9
hey clutch could see you

4115.4 --> 4118.0599999999995
foreign

4139.72 --> 4142.829000000001
[Music]

4143.38 --> 4149.799
because you had to say something whiny

4146.48 --> 4149.799
and [ __ ] about Nathan

4150.08 --> 4155.9
Proto fat like he's an actual expert

4153.219 --> 4159.58
there is just no way that you can

4155.9 --> 4159.58
actually think that seriously

4163.04 --> 4170.239
any flood earther uses sector to get a

4165.62 --> 4173.5
positive position fixed yeah 10th Man

4170.239 --> 4173.5
seeking star water

4173.719 --> 4178.819
are you blind said happy

4176.54 --> 4184.359
somebody literally

4178.819 --> 4184.359
two minutes before you literally said

4185.66 --> 4188.62
there you go

4189.98 --> 4198.639999999999
it's right there do you actually read

4193.46 --> 4198.64
the chat before you ask your questions

4215.66 --> 4220.78
so you can start where it actually did

4217.28 --> 4220.78
the Leicester navigation yeah

4223.75 --> 4226.909
[Music]

4245.26 --> 4251.06
smells the seeking star water have you

4248.179 --> 4253.58
performed Celestial navigation using a

4251.06 --> 4257.679
Sextant while you were living on your

4253.58 --> 4257.679
sailboat in those 15 years

4282.56 --> 4287.9800000000005
it would be great if you'd actually

4284.06 --> 4287.9800000000005
answered and chat so you can start water

4294.739 --> 4297.699
there you go

4299.9 --> 4303.0
[Music]

4307.82 --> 4312.5199999999995
there you go

4309.98 --> 4317.86
so

4312.52 --> 4317.860000000001
suspicious Amy s really does it now

4320.48 --> 4324.459999999999
you didn't really use it

4325.52 --> 4332.3
opposed to me

4327.86 --> 4332.299999999999
still suspect wow

4336.199 --> 4340.58
okay see well the next time I'm afraid

4338.9 --> 4343.879999999999
you're gonna have to smash your computer

4340.58 --> 4346.28
otherwise you didn't really use the

4343.88 --> 4350.06
sexton

4346.28 --> 4352.58
right I mean if you have a computer then

4350.06 --> 4356.0
technically you don't really use this

4352.58 --> 4358.88
accent even when you basically

4356.0 --> 4361.219
aim one of it like at the Horizon the

4358.88 --> 4363.32
other at the Sun and get your you do

4361.219 --> 4365.54
those things well you still didn't use

4363.32 --> 4367.28
that because you have a computer on

4365.54 --> 4370.04
board you see

4367.28 --> 4371.78
so you didn't really use that Sexton

4370.04 --> 4374.0
seeking star water

4371.78 --> 4376.46
because you had a computer award that

4374.0 --> 4378.62
that's the logic here

4376.46 --> 4381.08
because apparently if you have a

4378.62 --> 4383.179
computer on board then you can't perform

4381.08 --> 4386.239
Celestial navigation with this accident

4383.179 --> 4388.96
according to ball Tardes in chat here

4386.239 --> 4388.959999999999
brilliant

4391.28 --> 4394.0
very funny

4395.96 --> 4398.14
foreign

4401.679 --> 4407.4400000000005
said that oh yes of course no one that's

4404.659 --> 4411.139999999999
only strongly insinuated with your

4407.44 --> 4413.419999999999
suspicious still suspect still very oh

4411.14 --> 4416.659000000001
you didn't really use it with a computer

4413.42 --> 4417.5
on board Amy s really it doesn't mean

4416.659 --> 4420.379999999999
that

4417.5 --> 4423.679
somebody just oh cool straw man yeah

4420.38 --> 4425.3
cool bend your ass you [ __ ] lying

4423.679 --> 4428.6
[ __ ]

4425.3 --> 4431.06
you're a lying troll [ __ ]

4428.6 --> 4437.4400000000005
popping up

4431.06 --> 4437.4400000000005
to [ __ ] ah [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out [ __ ]

4449.56 --> 4455.6
[Music]

4452.199 --> 4457.639999999999
nobody said you can't yeah no [ __ ] said

4455.6 --> 4461.4800000000005
Gabby

4457.64 --> 4465.02
except ABS did say that as I literally

4461.48 --> 4467.12
just quoted Zepp tappy maybe you want to

4465.02 --> 4470.1990000000005
stop acting like a [ __ ] before I end

4467.12 --> 4470.199
up Banning you too

4470.54 --> 4473.54
foreign

4480.58 --> 4487.159
did I hear about Prince Bernard being an

4483.56 --> 4491.26
ass yet no [ __ ] Sherlock dude

4487.159 --> 4491.259999999999
I heard that in the freaking 80s

4492.26 --> 4498.280000000001
like everybody knew that every [ __ ]

4495.5 --> 4498.28
body knew that

4522.08 --> 4526.46
but now it's official uncomfortable oh

4525.02 --> 4527.540000000001
wow

4526.46 --> 4529.46
okay

4527.54 --> 4532.88
bro like

4529.46 --> 4535.94
who cares really

4532.88 --> 4537.92
I'm much more concerned about

4535.94 --> 4542.36
the actual

4537.92 --> 4546.5
King and freaking family being directly

4542.36 --> 4547.719
involved right now in wef programming

4546.5 --> 4552.82
and

4547.719 --> 4552.82
horrible horrible criminal activity

4553.3 --> 4559.719
involvement in the whole Ukraine [ __ ]

4555.98 --> 4559.718999999999
and just dude

4560.08 --> 4566.78
grandpa being a Nazi there is like just

4564.14 --> 4568.88
a that's like nothing

4566.78 --> 4573.099999999999
that's nothing compared to what they're

4568.88 --> 4573.1
actually engaging with right now

4578.679 --> 4584.2390000000005
oh it seems like it certainly triggered

4581.54 --> 4586.34
a few trolls today

4584.239 --> 4589.159
yeah

4586.34 --> 4593.360000000001
I wouldn't have to if you just

4589.159 --> 4596.259999999999
stop talking complete horseshit

4593.36 --> 4596.259999999999
that will work

4598.159 --> 4602.5
then you wouldn't need to get so

4599.96 --> 4602.5
triggered

4603.199 --> 4605.86
hmm

4616.159 --> 4621.0199999999995
who let the trolls out today

4619.46 --> 4623.659
I don't know

4621.02 --> 4626.38
I'll give this [ __ ] nobody lets nobody

4623.659 --> 4626.379999999999
keeps them in

4638.239 --> 4643.94
like I like mushrooms they just spread

4640.28 --> 4645.08
with spores and then suddenly it's it's

4643.94 --> 4647.659
just

4645.08 --> 4649.64
mushroom season and then they just poof

4647.659 --> 4653.199
their spores all over the place and

4649.64 --> 4653.1990000000005
certainly it's full of them yeah

4658.94 --> 4663.919999999999
that's right Evie Amy get banned troll

4661.52 --> 4666.26
star swarm starts that's very perceptive

4663.92 --> 4668.86
of you slow moon buggy I was thinking

4666.26 --> 4668.860000000001
the same thing

4682.12 --> 4685.82
the irony of it

4684.42 --> 4688.28
[Music]

4685.82 --> 4691.639999999999
what the irony of what that that you

4688.28 --> 4693.62
need a flat Baseline

4691.64 --> 4695.900000000001
to do the measurement

4693.62 --> 4698.78
and that you can't get that on a on a

4695.9 --> 4700.82
baller yeah I know the irony is very

4698.78 --> 4703.48
hilarious

4700.82 --> 4703.48
it is

4705.26 --> 4712.1
oh map yeah Oh you mean

4708.32 --> 4712.099999999999
the map projection

4712.64 --> 4719.84
map projection that's

4715.28 --> 4723.199
like a ball based projection that was

4719.84 --> 4726.5
calculated and derived from a flat plane

4723.199 --> 4728.78
measurements yeah

4726.5 --> 4731.36
it's a really big problem for the globe

4728.78 --> 4734.0599999999995
I know because everything you have all

4731.36 --> 4737.54
the measurements you've ever made

4734.06 --> 4742.360000000001
to try to promote a ball were all based

4737.54 --> 4746.179
off a flat plane using flat plane angles

4742.36 --> 4748.699
flat plane bass lines

4746.179 --> 4752.4800000000005
90 degrees

4748.699 --> 4756.0199999999995
all that like the very num the numbers

4752.48 --> 4758.178999999999
game of freaking geometry itself is

4756.02 --> 4761.3
based off the Earth being flat you

4758.179 --> 4763.82
[ __ ] hard why don't you get over it

4761.3 --> 4766.6990000000005
with your weird little reversed World

inner Joy of art so ironic yeah it's

4766.699 --> 4771.5599999999995
really ironic that every [ __ ] aspect

4769.64 --> 4776.179
of reality

4771.56 --> 4780.26
and how we process information itself is

4776.179 --> 4782.2390000000005
based off the Earth being flat yeah it's

4780.26 --> 4785.06
very [ __ ] funny

4782.239 --> 4788.659
we think so we think it's very [ __ ]

4785.06 --> 4792.1990000000005
funny that literally everything we do

4788.659 --> 4796.099999999999
all measurements we make how we think

4792.199 --> 4800.12
how we've divided numbers and ratios

4796.1 --> 4805.06
that it's all based off a flat plane yes

4800.12 --> 4805.0599999999995
it is very [ __ ] funny we agree

4812.73 --> 4815.7699999999995
[Music]

4821.36 --> 4828.199
it is very very funny especially that

4858.8 --> 4864.5

4861.679 --> 4866.84
of just being wise and shutting the [ __ ]

4864.5 --> 4868.58
up and not getting banned so the next

4866.84 --> 4870.679
day you could just have a conversation

4868.58 --> 4873.86
again

4870.679 --> 4877.0
but you don't have any self-control over

4873.86 --> 4877.0
your own triggering

4877.699 --> 4882.32
because you're a dumbass

4879.8 --> 4885.820000000001

with the witch and the needle on your

4892.04 --> 4897.62
neck you're the one that would die

4894.679 --> 4900.08
because you have no [ __ ] self-control

4897.62 --> 4903.5
cause you're a dumbass and you're a

4900.08 --> 4905.12
delusional like all ball Tarts you have

4903.5 --> 4908.6

4940.04 --> 4945.679

4948.56 --> 4954.14
really isn't the problem

4951.56 --> 4956.900000000001
you're just doing the work because

4954.14 --> 4960.320000000001
you're so [ __ ] [ __ ] and triggered

4956.9 --> 4962.0
that you spend all that extra time just

4960.32 --> 4966.199
to do that because you're [ __ ]

4962.0 --> 4968.48
[ __ ] with your soccer counts

4966.199 --> 4969.919999999999
wasting all that time and energy on the

4968.48 --> 4974.12
channel

4969.92 --> 4976.1
that's tiny a tiny little Channel on

4974.12 --> 4981.86
YouTube and this is your [ __ ] life

4976.1 --> 4983.54
you pathetic retards look at you look at

4981.86 --> 4987.5599999999995
your life

4983.54 --> 4989.719
making sock accounts to nag a person

4987.56 --> 4990.860000000001
with a tiny little channel on the

4989.719 --> 4993.8
internet

4990.86 --> 4995.54
because you're so triggered about being

4993.8 --> 4999.56
incapable

4995.54 --> 5002.0199999999995
of dealing with how reality works

4999.56 --> 5005.8
and when you hear reality then you have

5002.02 --> 5007.780000000001
to oppose it by an opposition to reality

5005.8 --> 5011.02
and hold on to it

5007.78 --> 5015.34
you have to put in all this effort

5011.02 --> 5018.900000000001
just to prevent reality from sinking in

5015.34 --> 5021.88
that you're wrong and the Earth is flat

5018.9 --> 5025.36
it always was flat

5021.88 --> 5028.26
all Globe Earth calculations are based

5025.36 --> 5032.739
of flat plane measurements

5028.26 --> 5036.280000000001
all maps are based of globe projections

5032.739 --> 5039.099999999999
that were mathematically created and

5036.28 --> 5040.9
arranged based off flat plane

5039.1 --> 5042.1
measurements

5040.9 --> 5046.32
yeah

5042.1 --> 5046.320000000001
and it's always going to be like that

5046.6 --> 5053.7390000000005
reality is was and always will be that

5051.4 --> 5056.32
Earth is flat

5053.739 --> 5060.459999999999
and there's nothing you can do about it

5056.32 --> 5064.0599999999995
but you can waste all your life away

5060.46 --> 5066.64
trying to hold it off from sinking in

5064.06 --> 5068.8
you can definitely waste your entire

5066.64 --> 5071.9800000000005
life doing that because this is never

5068.8 --> 5074.62
gonna go away the Earth is flat and it's

5071.98 --> 5077.799999999999
never gonna go away

5074.62 --> 5081.4
you hear never

5077.8 --> 5083.860000000001
not in a million years there even is

5081.4 --> 5089.0199999999995
such a time left

5083.86 --> 5091.9
yeah people will hear the Earth is flat

5089.02 --> 5094.2390000000005
at the end of the world

5091.9 --> 5097.0599999999995
in the last second

5094.239 --> 5099.639999999999
they will know the Earth is flat they

5097.06 --> 5102.42
will hear it and there's nothing you can

5099.64 --> 5102.42
do about it

5123.4 --> 5129.179

applying the gum jabard to ball Tarts

5330.699 --> 5337.96
which I don't do every day by the way

5334.6 --> 5340.0
because that gets really boring

5337.96 --> 5342.58
but sometimes I gotta do it like it's

5340.0 --> 5344.679
like a little fever period right you

5342.58 --> 5346.659
have to get the parasites out you have

5344.679 --> 5349.56
to Fever them out for a bit

5346.659 --> 5354.839999999999
the bit of rage and a bit of pointing at

5349.56 --> 5354.84
facts an avoidable facts

5356.739 --> 5363.159
so I apply the gum javar

5360.4 --> 5366.219
and then they all start to squirt and

5363.159 --> 5367.299999999999
then they die because the poison needle

5366.219 --> 5370.179
now

5367.3 --> 5372.1
goes in their neck because they had to

5370.179 --> 5373.96
pull their hand out because they're

5372.1 --> 5377.7390000000005
[ __ ] weak

5837.76 --> 5841.84
I really thought it was like just an

5840.04 --> 5844.179
annoying girl

5841.84 --> 5846.04
that was like trying to like find a

5844.179 --> 5847.179
place where she would be accepted or

5846.04 --> 5849.5199999999995
something

5847.179 --> 5852.159
that really felt like it and I know

5849.52 --> 5855.540000000001
women that are like that if like they

5852.159 --> 5855.54
always get on people's nerves

5855.82 --> 5861.28
but there actually it can be kind of

5858.159 --> 5862.78
nice underneath that just try not to get

5861.28 --> 5864.159
them triggered or whatever right and

5862.78 --> 5865.599999999999
that's what I thought we were dealing

5864.159 --> 5868.42
with but I mean

5865.6 --> 5869.9800000000005
this person is a complete act a total

5868.42 --> 5871.6
liar

5869.98 --> 5875.08
a psychopath

5871.6 --> 5879.04
a psychopath infiltrate

5875.08 --> 5883.36
a [ __ ] little soy boy [ __ ] that's

5879.04 --> 5887.8
actually willing to have a prolonged Act

5883.36 --> 5889.659
of being a female just to infiltrate a

5887.8 --> 5892.360000000001
hostile chat I mean

5889.659 --> 5895.48
that guy's a [ __ ] psychopath

5892.36 --> 5897.78
you're really really [ __ ] deranged

5895.48 --> 5897.78
dude

5906.179 --> 5911.92
oh yeah okay not full docs okay good

5909.52 --> 5916.9800000000005
point I'm appeal it's just

5911.92 --> 5916.9800000000005
got your private info done yeah I mean

5917.38 --> 5923.86
it's not doxing yet but it could be it

5919.9 --> 5926.98
could become that it's not nice

5923.86 --> 5928.0
you you kind of trusted them and I'm

5926.98 --> 5930.04
sorry

5928.0 --> 5934.8
I feel partially the blame for that

5930.04 --> 5934.8
because I defended Evie for so long

5950.92 --> 5955.7390000000005
all right anyway yeah

5953.98 --> 5958.54
I've got a few more minutes for the show

5955.739 --> 5960.82
don't forget to rogans it up it's

5958.54 --> 5964.0
currently looking like it's at six likes

5960.82 --> 5966.5199999999995
I'd love to be at that more I got a lot

5964.0 --> 5968.5
more people here in chat left in chat

5966.52 --> 5970.96
yeah because I don't give a [ __ ] what

5968.5 --> 5973.5
these bad soccercons do don't give a

5970.96 --> 5973.5
[ __ ] at all

5974.08 --> 5980.26
but there's plenty of people around here

5978.04 --> 5983.86
that are

5980.26 --> 5986.02
a permanent part of my chat or well for

5983.86 --> 5988.659
the foreseeable future

5986.02 --> 5991.4800000000005
please don't forget to rogans it up

5988.659 --> 5993.28
and yeah anybody wondering like why does

5991.48 --> 5995.0199999999995
he always say rogans and when he does

5993.28 --> 5998.219
the thumbs up

5995.02 --> 5998.219
it's because of Joe Rogan

5999.719 --> 6004.7390000000005
now I doubted any of you haven't ever

6002.4 --> 6007.0199999999995
heard of Joe Rogan

6004.739 --> 6008.699
well if you also heard of Owen Benjamin

6007.02 --> 6011.580000000001
then

6008.699 --> 6013.62
then you probably know why I say Rogan's

6011.58 --> 6015.96
up

6013.62 --> 6018.659
because well

6015.96 --> 6019.9800000000005
if you really carefully look at Joe

6018.659 --> 6022.98
Rogan

6019.98 --> 6025.138999999999
like his face his facial features all of

6022.98 --> 6028.08
it and look it at a distance and look at

6025.139 --> 6031.28
it up close you will realize that he is

6028.08 --> 6031.28
a human thumb

6032.76 --> 6038.34
it looks exactly like a thumb that's

6035.699 --> 6042.0
right that B I'm glad you get that and

6038.34 --> 6044.159000000001
that's why I asked the rogans it up

6042.0 --> 6048.9
because I was want to want you to

6044.159 --> 6053.659
remember that Joe Rogan is a human thumb

6048.9 --> 6053.659
and a complete and utter sellout

6054.9 --> 6060.179
and probably some other things that I'm

6057.0 --> 6062.699
Gonna Leave to to Owen Benjamin to

6060.179 --> 6064.679
talk about

6062.699 --> 6068.299999999999
because he's he's been a lot he's been

6064.679 --> 6068.3
well practically his friend

6069.42 --> 6074.84
so he knows them a lot better than I do

6071.52 --> 6074.84
I've never even seen him

6075.84 --> 6081.139
in real life so

6079.139 --> 6081.139
um

6085.139 --> 6089.76
I thought he looked like a toe yeah a

6088.44 --> 6092.759999999999
toe

6089.76 --> 6095.639
but like also a thumb

6092.76 --> 6097.02
it's not just toe like yeah it's Joe the

6095.639 --> 6100.139
toe

6097.02 --> 6101.46
but Joe the toe is a human thumb that's

6100.139 --> 6104.88
how it works

6101.46 --> 6106.679
because it doesn't look like a toe he

6104.88 --> 6108.659000000001
looks like a thumb

6106.679 --> 6110.58
a thumb without the nails the thumb

6108.659 --> 6113.4
without hair

6110.58 --> 6117.98
a clean cut thumb

6113.4 --> 6117.98
with short nails so not like my thumb

6138.0 --> 6147.619
Toyota Ravens domestic terrorist that's

6142.739 --> 6147.619
okay you could probably yeah of course

6148.619 --> 6154.259999999999
but I mean he can't kick everybody's ass

6152.1 --> 6156.900000000001
if you go at him one at a time yeah he's

6154.26 --> 6158.88
gonna kick your ass but I mean if you're

6156.9 --> 6162.138999999999
gonna go at him with six guys he's not

6158.88 --> 6162.139
gonna kick everybody's ass

6162.659 --> 6165.799999999999
he's freaking small

6167.52 --> 6174.139
yeah he's strong but I mean

6170.4 --> 6174.138999999999
six people pile it on

6174.42 --> 6177.92
he's not gonna make it

6178.98 --> 6184.638999999999
but nobody wants to pile on Joe Rogan

6181.92 --> 6188.28
anyway freaking gross

6184.639 --> 6190.7390000000005
just crawl up your ass or something

6188.28 --> 6193.58
ah

6190.739 --> 6193.58
foreign

6210.9 --> 6214.679
why do you think Joe Rogan is a domestic

6213.179 --> 6216.659
terrorist I mean

6214.679 --> 6218.6990000000005
I think he's a lot of disgusting things

6216.659 --> 6220.379999999999
but that

6218.699 --> 6223.08
I'm not sure

6220.38 --> 6225.78
specifically why

6223.08 --> 6227.1
I mean he's promoted like very dangerous

6225.78 --> 6230.099999999999
drugs

6227.1 --> 6232.02
very recklessly that's the thing that I

6230.1 --> 6234.6
mostly hate yeah

6232.02 --> 6236.1
that's the thing that I really really

6234.6 --> 6238.8
hate about him

6236.1 --> 6240.360000000001
that he did that it's unbelievably

6238.8 --> 6242.58
dangerous

6240.36 --> 6245.0
and the long-term consequence cannot be

6242.58 --> 6245.0
overseen

6246.78 --> 6251.58
but

6248.76 --> 6254.639
like yeah I mean the worst I think he's

6251.58 --> 6256.139
done is like promote the vaccine in the

6254.639 --> 6258.54
early days I don't think he does that

6256.139 --> 6259.4400000000005
anymore right but he did in the

6258.54 --> 6261.78
beginning

6259.44 --> 6264.36
and like quite a quite a long time I

6261.78 --> 6267.739
mean he would help censor people that

6264.36 --> 6267.739
were against that [ __ ] even

6273.3 --> 6278.659000000001
that drops a big part of this yeah okay

6276.06 --> 6278.659000000001
fair enough

6280.679 --> 6285.2390000000005
but how does that make them a domestic

6282.48 --> 6288.619
terrorist though I mean that's it's a

6285.239 --> 6288.619
bit of a leap

6298.26 --> 6304.92
I think probably like technically the

6301.199 --> 6307.678999999999
the all the rubbing elbows with

6304.92 --> 6310.38
Pfizer and all that

6307.679 --> 6313.4
just working along I think that that's

6310.38 --> 6313.400000000001
probably even worse

6313.739 --> 6316.699
poor what

6322.199 --> 6324.919999999999
what okay

6352.26 --> 6356.280000000001
[Music]

6353.48 --> 6358.5199999999995
the hours getting late and Rogan needs

6356.28 --> 6358.5199999999995
to go

6359.159 --> 6364.08
well he's just getting artificially

6361.199 --> 6367.04
pumped up I mean Joe Rogan isn't even

6364.08 --> 6367.04
that interesting anymore

6367.32 --> 6371.759999999999
anybody notice that

6369.06 --> 6375.780000000001
like Alex Jones sometimes like to Hype

6371.76 --> 6376.7390000000005
him up but he's just so boring now it's

6375.78 --> 6379.98
like

6376.739 --> 6382.619
he's like he's like drained it's like

6379.98 --> 6385.86
not he doesn't have any spunk anymore

6382.619 --> 6390.08
he's so [ __ ] lame Joe Rogan now is

6385.86 --> 6390.08
just so boring

6390.119 --> 6395.4
like how long is it gonna take before it

6392.46 --> 6397.92
just starts to talk really slowly or

6395.4 --> 6400.259999999999
something like I mean he can technically

6397.92 --> 6401.88
get even more boring but doesn't that

6400.26 --> 6406.34
stand out to you guys

6401.88 --> 6406.34
that he's so boring now

6406.56 --> 6410.34
if you just

6407.58 --> 6412.5
play what he does now and compare it to

6410.34 --> 6416.179
like 10 years ago or something that's

6412.5 --> 6416.179
like not the same person almost

6416.82 --> 6421.28
you think that he's on tranquilizers or

6419.04 --> 6421.28
something

6421.619 --> 6424.219
foreign

6427.44 --> 6432.78
it really like you have like you play

6430.139 --> 6437.4800000000005
the early Joe Rogan compared to now it's

6432.78 --> 6437.48
like they put him on tranquilizers

6437.699 --> 6442.82
really

6439.98 --> 6446.178999999999
vibrant guy that's very energetic very

6442.82 --> 6448.86
expressive and that is just like

6446.179 --> 6450.9
like what the [ __ ] that's a guy on

6448.86 --> 6452.94
tranquilizers

6450.9 --> 6455.638999999999
or that's how a person looks when they

6452.94 --> 6458.099999999999
are being kept in a mental institution

6455.639 --> 6459.6
on drugs continually that's how they

6458.1 --> 6462.06
look

6459.6 --> 6465.179
like what the [ __ ] is this

6462.06 --> 6467.6990000000005
Joe Rogan actually live in a mental

6465.179 --> 6469.8
institution and is allowed to do his

6467.699 --> 6472.159
shows on the side or something like what

6469.8 --> 6472.159000000001
the [ __ ]

6480.96 --> 6485.719
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

6483.6 --> 6485.719
show

6486.6 --> 6491.280000000001
never watch your well good for you you'd

6489.239 --> 6493.919999999999
you probably haven't you haven't missed

6491.28 --> 6497.96
much or an uncle Wombo

6493.92 --> 6497.96
it's just really tedious now anyway

6501.84 --> 6505.32
you didn't take choreos into account

6504.119 --> 6509.0599999999995
when you kicked the ball that's right

6505.32 --> 6509.0599999999995
that's right septaphy

6510.179 --> 6515.219
I love confessional debating

6512.58 --> 6516.42
I'm making an argument by come by

6515.219 --> 6519.9800000000005

6526.44 --> 6530.5199999999995
Rowdy but I still thought it was went

6528.719 --> 6533.52
well I didn't like

6530.52 --> 6536.88
actually really become angry or anything

6533.52 --> 6540.06
like too much

6536.88 --> 6542.179
and yeah a bit bit cleaning up
