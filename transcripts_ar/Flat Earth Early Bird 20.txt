3.08 --> 11.459
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.8 --> 14.639
early-bird episode 20 I'm your host

11.459 --> 18.15
Arwen starting out today I have no

14.639 --> 31.369
guests yet but maybe they will drop in

18.15 --> 31.369
all the time so cold it's cold very cold

33.95 --> 50.96000000000001
yeah glad to be inside so it's using

41.16 --> 59.269
Chet P Mars which Bella quantum 1 5 4 2

50.96 --> 59.269
dank good morning can I talk about today

61.91 --> 73.56
first let me do a little shout-out to

67.65 --> 77.68900000000001
Rory the Hori sheet show somebody

73.56 --> 83.31
pointed out to me that his show had a

77.689 --> 90.21
very familiar theme to it and yeah that

83.31 --> 92.82000000000001
was kind of funny and I guess the well I

90.21 --> 96.329
did write a comment about it and even

92.82 --> 99.89899999999999
pinned it but yeah he claims that he

96.329 --> 104.579
didn't follow me and just just thought

99.899 --> 107.18900000000001
of it by accident okay Ari but even if

104.579 --> 111.55999999999999
you were I don't know imitation is the

107.189 --> 114.27
most sincere form of flattery so so fine

111.56 --> 119.49000000000001
but hey you should be paying more

114.27 --> 121.04899999999999
attention to my channel okay it's been

119.49 --> 123.08999999999999
here for almost three weeks

121.049 --> 128.899
tomorrow is the three-week anniversary

123.09 --> 128.899
episode nothing special just three weeks

130.27 --> 146.26000000000002
yeah what else much yeah it's big

142.81 --> 149.77
personal life stuff had a really

146.26 --> 156.54999999999998
fascinating conversation yesterday

149.77 --> 158.59
evening bumped into a woman yeah

156.55 --> 162.99
interesting that was working on some

158.59 --> 165.97
human rights stuff and she basically

162.99 --> 168.88
opened up to me to a certain degree and

165.97 --> 172.69
shared what she was working on and it's

168.88 --> 175.69
really fascinating and difficult almost

172.69 --> 181.84
like diplomacy judicial related in the

175.69 --> 184.24
Middle East but yeah also by the way I

181.84 --> 188.65
was slightly drunk from a bottle of wine

184.24 --> 191.8
that I accidentally drank all the way

188.65 --> 198.01
through no supposed to me take half of

191.8 --> 205.24
it but I enjoyed it a lot and that's

198.01 --> 211.20999999999998
enough for now but yeah yeah when I'm in

205.24 --> 217.51000000000002
a good mood then someone can like make

211.21 --> 219.95000000000002
me look looser that more engaging little

217.51 --> 223.09
more reckless I guess okay

219.95 --> 223.08999999999997
[Music]

226.53 --> 234.51
I invited hurry over it was actually

230.4 --> 236.78
there I'm Skype so let's see if he comes

234.51 --> 236.78
in

251.23 --> 256.73
right

254.04 --> 256.73
yeah

276.05 --> 282.02000000000004
maybe we could talk some social stuff I

278.06 --> 284.36
think there's granthi maybe also thanks

282.02 --> 289.15999999999997
to the cold and everything new wave

284.36 --> 297.41
hitting people of maybe new levels of

289.16 --> 301.13000000000005
stress or just like more aggravation on

297.41 --> 303.83000000000004
the typical natural instabilities part

301.13 --> 306.349
of their character and people that act

303.83 --> 309.71
kind of weird normally are now acting

306.349 --> 313.07
with erratic it seems to be happening a

309.71 --> 316.60999999999996
lot Pete Mars is going on full-on insane

313.07 --> 321.08
again and yes our EP may be here a

316.61 --> 326.84000000000003
little bit better today but do you go

321.08 --> 331.50899999999996
way off the real sometimes and other

326.84 --> 331.50899999999996
ballers to notice just this

334.169 --> 345.56899999999996
this you say is really it's anger it's

339.719 --> 347.129
more intense that leaks out during don't

345.569 --> 351.569
during conversations and interactions

347.129 --> 354.15000000000003
and no I guess maybe Nathan is also a

351.569 --> 356.55
little bit more ranting than usual a

354.15 --> 358.77
little bit harsher more brutal against

356.55 --> 362.55
the Glovers I'm just noticing there's

358.77 --> 365.849
just a change in wound in general mood

362.55 --> 370.439
and everybody's affected by it in that

365.849 --> 376.259
is in their own typical way so yeah

370.439 --> 379.939
I study that sort of thing let's see

376.259 --> 384.379
where's Hari could be on any moment now

379.939 --> 384.379
happy Morris I'm normal

396.69 --> 400.1
Colonel Baggins

402.46 --> 405.419
ridiculous

407.62 --> 417.76
yeah yeah I know I heard about the EI

413.08 --> 420.82
clock app yeah look you can use this

417.76 --> 423.96
projection based map literal eyes it and

420.82 --> 430.45
make all kinds of funny props with it

423.96 --> 433.71
but the map is still a projection which

430.45 --> 436.21
means not literally to scale in all

433.71 --> 440.53
relations that's the difficult part

436.21 --> 446.53
about it and yeah you got to really

440.53 --> 449.95
prove these distance relations on this

446.53 --> 452.89
map kind of prove it and not trick your

449.95 --> 456.01
way through it but just literally okay

452.89 --> 457.9
at this point you go this angle this

456.01 --> 465.46
length where are you gonna end up just

457.9 --> 468.01
very straightforward and yeah you don't

465.46 --> 471.0
just rely on the projection it's still a

468.01 --> 474.58
projection still along the two latitude

471.0 --> 477.82
heavenly body based all these maps are

474.58 --> 481.45
based on the heavenly body orientation

477.82 --> 482.86
that's how it works because of the

481.45 --> 485.28999999999996
heavenly bodies and their mysterious

482.86 --> 488.85
nature that does not automatically

485.29 --> 491.68
review any kind of literal position just

488.85 --> 494.61
relational position a geometrical

491.68 --> 497.92
relation between the locations and the

494.61 --> 501.04
outer globe of the heavens changes

497.92 --> 503.55
correlating to that doesn't actually

501.04 --> 507.27000000000004
tell you the real shape you have to

503.55 --> 512.14
figure that out literally step-by-step

507.27 --> 517.26
measuring it out so that's still going

512.14 --> 520.75
to be an issue and there will be field

517.26 --> 526.38
measuring work required on a serious

520.75 --> 534.63
skill to settle this case to move beyond

526.38 --> 538.4399999999999
projection based models so hey hurry

534.63 --> 538.4399999999999
greetings our whim

542.55 --> 548.8599999999999

okay that's better yeah always always

565.99 --> 575.529
changes me up a little bit the end of it

567.49 --> 581.199

581.199 --> 589.18
cool fun indeed hey thanks for coming

586.389 --> 591.519
man oh no problem no problem just um

589.18 --> 594.069
just thought I'd say hi I'm still up

591.519 --> 596.889
from last night and I've been doing my

594.069 --> 598.569
thing and I'm learning a lot about OBS

596.889 --> 601.0600000000001
I'm just I just set up all these new

598.569 --> 601.709
backgrounds and whatnot and I'm just

601.06 --> 605.2299999999999
having fun

601.709 --> 610.569
sure man you really know how to work it

605.23 --> 616.48
I have OBS and I'm still like that's not

610.569 --> 618.279
working I don't like new programs I mean

616.48 --> 621.73
they're how it goes

618.279 --> 623.38
yeah I can I can spice it up off yeah oh

621.73 --> 626.6800000000001
wait what happened I didn't get my spice

623.38 --> 628.41
what happened to my spice Oh something

626.68 --> 631.81
that's that well I mean is this my spice

628.41 --> 640.06
there we go yeah light the fire a little

631.81 --> 641.709
bit oh he's gonna turn blue no no I'm

640.06 --> 643.42
just on fire now no wonder it took so

641.709 --> 645.67
long I set it for eight seconds instead

643.42 --> 648.37
of like a half a second so it took

645.67 --> 651.55
forever to spice it up alright now you

648.37 --> 655.47
don't get my reference do you know sorry

651.55 --> 657.459
if I said the spice eyes turning blue

655.47 --> 661.6
what do you think I don't get it

657.459 --> 664.779
I don't know transitive movies it's a

661.6 --> 666.22
movie or a book both see ya

664.779 --> 671.17
meri that's where a science fiction

666.22 --> 672.64
novel series oh my goodness I don't read

671.17 --> 675.79
much you know my favorite book

672.64 --> 677.68
good night moon you know why because it

675.79 --> 681.79
was probably only about 20 pages and

677.68 --> 684.37
most of the pages had no words sorry the

681.79 --> 686.8299999999999
last part most pages have what most most

684.37 --> 689.02
of the pages had no words really just

686.83 --> 691.1500000000001
pictures yeah I don't like I don't like

689.02 --> 693.31
reading it really it just puts me to

691.15 --> 694.9599999999999
sleep for some reason if I read like

693.31 --> 696.9399999999999
just constantly read books and turn

694.96 --> 700.1800000000001
pages I go to sleep I don't know what

696.94 --> 703.48
happened I have my same thing I have

700.18 --> 706.2399999999999
literally a bud with me and expresses it

703.48 --> 711.28
is is basically routed in hyperactivity

706.24 --> 713.44
and dyslexia can manifest in any forms

711.28 --> 715.27
and with me but what happens is I start

713.44 --> 719.95
to read something and especially if it's

715.27 --> 724.96
really interesting or fine-tune detailed

719.95 --> 728.5300000000001
worked out then that level will just yak

724.96 --> 731.6500000000001
make me sink into it and then as I read

728.53 --> 733.48
I just lose track and I keep on reading

731.65 --> 735.5699999999999
but I don't actually know what I'm

733.48 --> 738.3100000000001
reading and I'm just in my imagination

735.57 --> 738.7900000000001
doing other things and tying in other

738.31 --> 740.9499999999999
things

738.79 --> 744.9699999999999
and then after two pages like wait what

740.95 --> 746.8000000000001
am I actually reading yeah I have I have

744.97 --> 750.61
a serious problem just listening to

746.8 --> 752.5
YouTube videos so reading is it's the

750.61 --> 754.66
next step of difficulty I'll be

752.5 --> 756.28
listening to videos and just listening

754.66 --> 759.0699999999999
and then I realized like I'm just

756.28 --> 760.87
listening to sounds instead of actually

759.07 --> 764.6800000000001
taking any of it in and then I'm like ah

760.87 --> 766.9
I have to rewind and pay attention hmm

764.68 --> 769.4499999999999
so it's hard for me to just do research

766.9 --> 773.77
and take notes much less read and soak

769.45 --> 775.48
anything in so yeah I don't read just

773.77 --> 780.52
for entertainment because I'll never get

775.48 --> 782.46
through it mate so yeah if you need to

780.52 --> 788.1999999999999
focus there are supplements you can take

782.46 --> 791.8000000000001
to help like adderall no that's not a

788.2 --> 795.9000000000001
son that's our masu tickle crap

791.8 --> 798.3299999999999
no I'm talking about other herbs oh

795.9 --> 801.28
really yeah

798.33 --> 803.2
but yeah you're the only source that I

801.28 --> 805.66
know is from Alex Jones but there are

803.2 --> 806.6500000000001
others out there that sell basically the

805.66 --> 810.73
same type of

806.65 --> 814.93
from other sources and but yeah there

810.73 --> 818.71
are some nutrias like what is it

814.93 --> 822.8199999999999
it's nutriceuticals it's also nootropics

818.71 --> 826.62
yeah nootropics that's right but not the

822.82 --> 830.47
helis energetic types runs and just

826.62 --> 833.5
helps you focus really really well look

830.47 --> 836.65
I I have it I don't use it though I

833.5 --> 839.02
haven't used it yet because I have I

836.65 --> 842.89
don't have as much trouble focusing now

839.02 --> 845.4399999999999
as I used to for some reason it cleared

842.89 --> 851.02
up a problem because I've been eating so

845.44 --> 852.4300000000001
healthy hmm for such a long time there's

851.02 --> 856.6899999999999
a lot of things I need to probably

852.43 --> 859.17
change and I'm sure that alcohol is one

856.69 --> 863.44
of the biggest things that would help me

859.17 --> 865.5999999999999
maybe focus better I want to show you my

863.44 --> 868.36
business card I'm well not a business

865.6 --> 870.6700000000001
card it's my flat smackin card check

868.36 --> 873.67
this out I just made them and I just got

870.67 --> 875.68
them ordered and sent over I'm gonna put

873.67 --> 878.0699999999999
it up on the on the screen in a second

875.68 --> 883.75
here I'm just making the thing bigger

878.07 --> 888.1
check this out it says there's the front

883.75 --> 891.09
of it it says Earth we get out the damn

888.1 --> 893.6800000000001
way hold on let me just turn myself off

891.09 --> 896.6800000000001
I'm just like I'm making it hard for no

893.68 --> 901.93
reason here um here we go

896.68 --> 908.02
okay oh I still have the smoke it says

901.93 --> 910.5699999999999
earth is flat earth is flat the Hori

908.02 --> 915.01
sheet show watch it on YouTube and then

910.57 --> 918.2800000000001
on the back I have the truth will shock

915.01 --> 923.8199999999999
you and I have some tiny URL links that

918.28 --> 926.65
was so hard yeah it says Tyler noise

923.82 --> 928.9300000000001
yeah oh yeah definitely color noise I

926.65 --> 931.3
have yeah I wanted to stand out I wanted

928.93 --> 935.1099999999999
to like be noticed you find these kind

931.3 --> 940.0
of fliers at like dance parties yeah

935.11 --> 940.39
exactly so I have saved some tinyurl

940.0 --> 943.54
wings

940.39 --> 946.66
tinyurl.com slash flat video one two

943.54 --> 949.9599999999999
three four five and so all of those

946.66 --> 952.27
point to like one of them's one of

949.96 --> 954.61
them's OD DS flat earth nature

952.27 --> 956.74
documentary two and and then another

954.61 --> 960.16
video of his also the litmus test video

956.74 --> 962.83
and maybe Eric debase 200-proof sir stop

960.16 --> 964.14
spinning ball and I think D Murphy's

962.83 --> 966.49
video when he's in that uh

964.14 --> 968.62
when he's doing that interview with that

966.49 --> 973.33
guy on that TV show that was a pretty

968.62 --> 974.77
good one and so yes it's good videos all

973.33 --> 977.1700000000001
those links right there and then Scott

974.77 --> 978.97
of course to my show and my website but

977.17 --> 980.5
I'ma stick these in gas pumps in the

978.97 --> 983.2900000000001
little credit card slot and the gas

980.5 --> 985.06
pumps and any any we're really I'm even

983.29 --> 986.4699999999999
mean Caroline everywhere we go dude

985.06 --> 990.88
we're always putting these things out

986.47 --> 995.11
it's hilarious hmm cool yeah and it'll

990.88 --> 996.64
work probably well I mean it's you just

995.11 --> 998.92
never know you've really just never know

996.64 --> 1001.68
I was I was just being a goofball the

998.92 --> 1004.11
other day at the in the in the

1001.68 --> 1006.9899999999999
supermarket because I mean anywhere I go

1004.11 --> 1009.0600000000001
I'm I'm trying to goof off like I just I

1006.99 --> 1011.13
got to have fun with life and so when I

1009.06 --> 1015.4499999999999
have the when I have the buggy I'm

1011.13 --> 1017.49
always I'm walking with the buggy and

1015.45 --> 1019.8000000000001
I'm making it look like I'm picking my

1017.49 --> 1022.89
body weight up off the ground and I'm

1019.8 --> 1024.3
I'm I'm just moving my feet like like

1022.89 --> 1025.35
I'm walking but I'm not even touching

1024.3 --> 1028.35
the ground so it looks like I'm just

1025.35 --> 1030.12
floating and the buggies moving faster

1028.35 --> 1032.55
than I'm actually moving my feet so it's

1030.12 --> 1034.5
like this optical illusion and then

1032.55 --> 1038.25
people people look at it in there like

1034.5 --> 1040.14
yeah this guy what's he doing the

1038.25 --> 1044.459
attention I caught the attention of this

1040.14 --> 1047.5200000000002
this dude it was the buggy guy and he

1044.459 --> 1049.0800000000002
was like he he he saw me from like what

1047.52 --> 1051.3
like I don't know like six aisles down

1049.08 --> 1053.52
and he was laughing at Caroline saw and

1051.3 --> 1055.4099999999999
laughing well actually no correct myself

1053.52 --> 1057.0
somebody that was closer to us was

1055.41 --> 1058.89
laughing at me and Caroline was pointing

1057.0 --> 1059.79
that out and I was like haha yeah people

1058.89 --> 1062.4
people like what I do

1059.79 --> 1064.2
and and then the guy comes from six

1062.4 --> 1066.0600000000002
aisles down into my aisle and he was

1064.2 --> 1067.65
like yo I saw you doing that it's

1066.06 --> 1070.44
awesome and uh and still we started

1067.65 --> 1071.8200000000002
talking and and I was just talking about

1070.44 --> 1074.24
the buggy thing and then we went outside

1071.82 --> 1075.77
and started loading the groceries up and

1074.24 --> 1078.8
he was out there collecting the buggies

1075.77 --> 1080.54
and I did it again just because I'd do

1078.8 --> 1083.12
it like all the way to the car and [Â __Â ]

1080.54 --> 1084.17
and he was laughing again and I turned

1083.12 --> 1086.12
around I was like oh it's that same guy

1084.17 --> 1089.179
and so I was like hey man come here and

1086.12 --> 1091.1899999999998
I gave him a card and you started

1089.179 --> 1093.44
talking Flat Earth and by the end of it

1091.19 --> 1095.72
she yeah by the end of it he was just

1093.44 --> 1097.25
like wow this sounds really amazing I

1095.72 --> 1099.29
told him you know about space bubbles

1097.25 --> 1100.73
and like the Sun set how you rolling

1099.29 --> 1102.74
backwards watching the Sun set and how

1100.73 --> 1104.09
that's crap and like I'm like do you

1102.74 --> 1105.5
feel us moving six hundred miles per

1104.09 --> 1107.27
hour right now he's like no and I'm like

1105.5 --> 1108.86
at me either you know and he was just

1107.27 --> 1110.24
like wow yeah that makes a lot of sense

1108.86 --> 1111.6499999999999
makes a lot of sense it's all about

1110.24 --> 1113.57
Photoshop clouds I mean it kind of

1111.65 --> 1115.3090000000002
really really hammered like a bunch of

1113.57 --> 1117.08
things really quickly and then we wrote

1115.309 --> 1122.3899999999999
oh yeah the funnel clouds are like

1117.08 --> 1124.73
you're real oh yeah yeah so we uh we

1122.39 --> 1126.3500000000001
flat smacked him really good and handed

1124.73 --> 1128.59
him a card with a couple of different

1126.35 --> 1131.51
channels on it handed him one of these

1128.59 --> 1134.809
flat earth clues cards one of marks

1131.51 --> 1136.28
Argent's cards and I mean like by the

1134.809 --> 1138.1399999999999
end of it like he was just he was just

1136.28 --> 1140.12
really like I don't know magnetically

1138.14 --> 1141.41
attracted to my my spirit or something

1140.12 --> 1143.809
like yeah in the grocery store he was

1141.41 --> 1146.24
like man I wish you were my dad I was

1143.809 --> 1149.1789999999999
like what that's cool huh yeah that's

1146.24 --> 1150.89
cool thing here but he was like man I

1149.179 --> 1153.02
want to like hang out like after work

1150.89 --> 1154.22
and [Â __Â ] like you know he was he was

1153.02 --> 1157.1299999999999
trying to like see if we can hang out

1154.22 --> 1161.03
and I'm like look dude do some research

1157.13 --> 1163.3090000000002
and and I'll see you next week good if

1161.03 --> 1164.96
you still feel good about that I didn't

1163.309 --> 1166.1299999999999
tell him that but I'm like I don't know

1164.96 --> 1169.64
about hanging out with just random

1166.13 --> 1171.92
people like I would wait let it sink in

1169.64 --> 1172.91
first yeah you're gonna have a couple of

1171.92 --> 1180.76
sleepless nights

1172.91 --> 1183.0800000000002
don't jump with power straightaway I

1180.76 --> 1188.6299999999999
totally gave him all the tools he needs

1183.08 --> 1190.8799999999999
to not get any sleep for the next and

1188.63 --> 1192.5900000000001
we're gonna he told us he works there on

1190.88 --> 1194.3000000000002
weekends so we're gonna take a special

1192.59 --> 1196.07
trip on Saturday just to see if he's

1194.3 --> 1200.09
working and see how I see if he's done

1196.07 --> 1200.75
any research so cool yeah I love that

1200.09 --> 1202.61
kind of stuff

1200.75 --> 1203.96
love that kind of stuff I mean I can't

1202.61 --> 1205.9099999999999
live without doing it if I'm in an

1203.96 --> 1207.65
elevator for more than five minutes with

1205.91 --> 1207.89
you and flats Makani if you count my

1207.65 --> 1209.75
chain

1207.89 --> 1211.7
you're takin too long appliance Makani

1209.75 --> 1212.99
if Ike if I'm if I'm at the register and

1211.7 --> 1214.3700000000001
I can't get my credit card out in my

1212.99 --> 1222.49
back pocket fast enough because my

1214.37 --> 1226.55
wallets too fat I'm a flat smack Wow

1222.49 --> 1231.05
well you could do it I I'm much more

1226.55 --> 1233.12
careful like I really want to get the

1231.05 --> 1236.03
trust of people first and then bring it

1233.12 --> 1237.3999999999999
to them really slow them slowly through

1236.03 --> 1241.01
their own knowledge

1237.4 --> 1243.8000000000002
mmm us and you any knowledge will always

1241.01 --> 1245.72
have its points like I don't know about

1243.8 --> 1249.68
it and I'll have something to say about

1245.72 --> 1253.15
it like any anything and it can all

1249.68 --> 1255.8600000000001
basically point to a giant structure and

1253.15 --> 1258.5900000000001
how these people think and how things

1255.86 --> 1260.36
are being controlled and then they still

1258.59 --> 1264.86
go with it if they have the stamina the

1260.36 --> 1267.59
mental stamina that's when I starts like

1264.86 --> 1270.1999999999998
just name-dropping at first flat earth

1267.59 --> 1271.97
among other things and then just see

1270.2 --> 1275.93
what their response is and if they're

1271.97 --> 1277.97
not shocked then I will actually bring

1275.93 --> 1280.97
it up completely and that way it's

1277.97 --> 1284.33
always yeah I never have like a fight

1280.97 --> 1286.13
about it or anything okay that's good

1284.33 --> 1291.56
cuz I don't want to be associated with

1286.13 --> 1293.18
that oh yeah yeah I don't I don't push

1291.56 --> 1294.9199999999998
people too far I kind of get you know I

1293.18 --> 1296.78
can read them instantly when I hand them

1294.92 --> 1299.51
a card then I say hey look check it out

1296.78 --> 1302.03
and they read it and I'm like earth is

1299.51 --> 1305.0
flat it's not a lie and I think it's

1302.03 --> 1307.1299999999999
like it takes three seconds after I say

1305.0 --> 1309.8
that for their face to finish forming

1307.13 --> 1311.6000000000001
and if it's either good or bad they're

1309.8 --> 1313.19
like they're like Flat Earth and they

1311.6 --> 1314.6599999999999
don't know what to think and you know a

1313.19 --> 1316.5800000000002
second or two later they're either oh

1314.66 --> 1318.5
that's so stupid and this guy's an idiot

1316.58 --> 1320.54
or they're like Flat Earth what about

1318.5 --> 1325.16
flutter it's a completely different face

1320.54 --> 1326.84
and yeah and I'm getting better at just

1325.16 --> 1328.64
handed in the card and feeling them out

1326.84 --> 1331.6999999999998
right away right on the spot I tried to

1328.64 --> 1333.95
flat smack the lady that I signed up for

1331.7 --> 1335.3600000000001
a medical cannabis card for a while I

1333.95 --> 1337.67
was in the cannabis place the other day

1335.36 --> 1339.59
she's like I said if I'm around you for

1337.67 --> 1341.22
too long I'm a flat smack you so I'm

1339.59 --> 1343.32
sitting there getting my give my

1341.22 --> 1344.22
the form filled out and [Â __Â ] she's

1343.32 --> 1347.609
putting all the stuff in the computer

1344.22 --> 1350.94
and I look around and I see a painting

1347.609 --> 1353.369
on her wall and it's a astronaut flying

1350.94 --> 1356.039
around in a spacesuit with a you know

1353.369 --> 1358.32
applying at the background and and it's

1356.039 --> 1361.049
like this really cool trippy looking oil

1358.32 --> 1363.21
painting and like French style painting

1361.049 --> 1365.609
or whatever it was just a unique local

1363.21 --> 1366.989
artist that did it and I commented on it

1365.609 --> 1369.149
and she's like oh yeah yeah I used to

1366.989 --> 1371.159
have an Einstein picture there and then

1369.149 --> 1374.7289999999998
before that it was a robot picture so I

1371.159 --> 1376.71
was like little boy I can I can see that

1374.729 --> 1381.239
this is gonna be an interesting flat

1376.71 --> 1384.0900000000001
smack and and so I just went straight

1381.239 --> 1386.3690000000001
into it right right big big science fan

1384.09 --> 1388.559
and so I just went right into it I'm

1386.369 --> 1390.539
like I don't care you know and turn

1388.559 --> 1394.95
turns out like you could tell like this

1390.539 --> 1397.739
chick's face was like really perturbed

1394.95 --> 1399.809
when I mentioned flattered she was she

1397.739 --> 1401.539
looked at me like oh no you're one of

1399.809 --> 1404.639
those mm-hmm

1401.539 --> 1406.619
and and she you know she proceeded to

1404.639 --> 1410.4599999999998
tell me you ready for this face ball

1406.619 --> 1412.4399999999998
Marwin she said oh my god you cannot

1410.46 --> 1418.5900000000001
tell me the earth is flat I have seen

1412.44 --> 1420.69
the curvature from sea level I've been

1418.59 --> 1423.539
on the ocean and if you look to the left

1420.69 --> 1426.21
and to the right you can see in the

1423.539 --> 1432.84
distance it's curved to the left and the

1426.21 --> 1435.419
right I just I knew right away that

1432.84 --> 1439.4089999999999
there was a no possible way I was gonna

1435.419 --> 1448.0490000000002
win that and was she drinking during

1439.409 --> 1449.97
that boat trip I don't know subjects to

1448.049 --> 1452.849
that well she had tats all the way up to

1449.97 --> 1455.369
her Oh risks I'm sure she was yet she

1452.849 --> 1457.259
had big old gauges in her ears so I'm

1455.369 --> 1459.299
sure she's got a wild side even though

1457.259 --> 1462.299
she is in her little scrub nurse outfit

1459.299 --> 1465.809
looking thing for this medical hot place

1462.299 --> 1468.6589999999999
but she was a total science Einstein

1465.809 --> 1471.479
like mmm just believe mainstream kind of

1468.659 --> 1474.69
chick and she saw the curve from the

1471.479 --> 1476.28
frickin ocean sea level man Hey

1474.69 --> 1478.5900000000001
few little enough you can see the

1476.28 --> 1483.96
curvature anywhere ha ha ha

1478.59 --> 1485.79
sure that's what she thinks right no but

1483.96 --> 1488.3400000000001
I'm serious like part of the

1485.79 --> 1489.99
psychological problem of science fans is

1488.34 --> 1494.03
that they're so used to looking at

1489.99 --> 1497.25
models and calculations it replaces

1494.03 --> 1499.98
their priority over actual observations

1497.25 --> 1503.43
and they will actually imagine things

1499.98 --> 1506.79
and for what they're seeing if the

1503.43 --> 1510.2
reality doesn't perfectly adapt to it so

1506.79 --> 1514.68
yeah the serious self pollution there

1510.2 --> 1516.1200000000001
happens to a lot of people mm-hmm I've

1514.68 --> 1517.8600000000001
talked to lots of people that told me

1516.12 --> 1520.6799999999998
they could see the curvature from from

1517.86 --> 1524.79
the ground and and with their naked eyes

1520.68 --> 1528.3
you know that that I was I was flat

1524.79 --> 1532.11
smacking last night on on you know calm

1528.3 --> 1534.51
and it was going really well and and

1532.11 --> 1536.31
then she goes well you know it sounds

1534.51 --> 1538.05
interesting but I've seen the curve from

1536.31 --> 1539.49
from an airplane and here's my picture

1538.05 --> 1540.96
on my phone and she showed me the phone

1539.49 --> 1542.73
and I mean it looked curved as hell and

1540.96 --> 1544.29
I asked her I was like well wait a

1542.73 --> 1548.67
second what was that was that taken with

1544.29 --> 1550.8
she goes oh my GoPro and I was like your

1548.67 --> 1554.39
GoPro I was like do you have any idea

1550.8 --> 1557.6699999999998
what fisheye lenses are and she was like

1554.39 --> 1559.38
and I was like well all GoPros have

1557.67 --> 1561.3300000000002
fisheye lenses and they do that to the

1559.38 --> 1562.98
they curve anything you know unless the

1561.33 --> 1565.23
cameras pointed straight at it and level

1562.98 --> 1567.54
it's gonna curve anything 5 10 feet off

1565.23 --> 1569.85
the ground yeah and I think way too if

1567.54 --> 1572.22
it's been slicing worse you'll get a

1569.85 --> 1575.55
globe curve it's been actually upwards

1572.22 --> 1577.3500000000001
then you'll get a hollow curve wait

1575.55 --> 1579.12
isn't it the opposite if you bend it up

1577.35 --> 1582.51
you're gonna get a ball and if you're

1579.12 --> 1584.52
down it's gonna be like concave up right

1582.51 --> 1589.17
I could have turned it around yeah sorry

1584.52 --> 1591.75
but yeah it's all yes it is really about

1589.17 --> 1595.3700000000001
trickery just keeping that fisheye lens

1591.75 --> 1597.81
in the right angle yeah exactly it's the

1595.37 --> 1600.84
orientation of the plane or whatever and

1597.81 --> 1602.1299999999999
yeah it'll look like a ball mm-hmm

1600.84 --> 1604.77
that's what they do when they they must

1602.13 --> 1606.15
have those cameras on the ISS when

1604.77 --> 1608.22
they're doing their spacewalks however

1606.15 --> 1612.0900000000001
they're filming the

1608.22 --> 1613.92
the the CGI allocated background that

1612.09 --> 1615.48
they have that produces the ball in

1613.92 --> 1616.98
post-production like whether they must

1615.48 --> 1619.47
be pointing the camera at one of those

1616.98 --> 1622.98
checkerboarded squared things in the

1619.47 --> 1625.53
pool and and it's tracking that that mat

1622.98 --> 1627.81
basically as as Earth and but anyway

1625.53 --> 1629.96
they have the camera on a pivot or

1627.81 --> 1632.8799999999999
something they have it on a frickin

1629.96 --> 1634.82
something and they can only move it just

1632.88 --> 1637.6200000000001
the right angle so that that background

1634.82 --> 1638.73
keeps it a ball I don't know how they're

1637.62 --> 1639.8999999999999
doing even though it's much more

1638.73 --> 1645.33
complicated than that

1639.9 --> 1648.5400000000002
it might based a 300 system hmm well the

1645.33 --> 1650.85
earth curve is a separate film that's

1648.54 --> 1655.17
just a plane flying over the earth as

1650.85 --> 1657.4199999999998
usual a trip that's why it turns off and

1655.17 --> 1660.5700000000002
then resets that kind of thing it's just

1657.42 --> 1663.6000000000001
an animation it's but it is green screen

1660.57 --> 1666.21
or whatever type of screens and in front

1663.6 --> 1668.6399999999999
of it that is where the puppet show is

1666.21 --> 1672.15
basically happened like the the outside

1668.64 --> 1674.0700000000002
is just like like Star Wars basically in

1672.15 --> 1677.1000000000001
front of the screen and they use the

1674.07 --> 1679.1399999999999
earth flight traffic we have plane

1677.1 --> 1681.9599999999998
flight travel with the fisheye lens as

1679.14 --> 1683.6100000000001
backdrop for that and the other times

1681.96 --> 1687.75
when astronauts are involved they go to

1683.61 --> 1691.1999999999998
the to the swimming pool set up but it

1687.75 --> 1694.23
yeah yeah difficult with that one to to

1691.2 --> 1697.56
put the background in there because of

1694.23 --> 1700.95
water because anomalies bubbles all that

1697.56 --> 1703.8
it's more obvious that it's fake then

1700.95 --> 1707.52
when they use the Star Wars studio setup

1703.8 --> 1709.9199999999998
without people it's much much cleaner

1707.52 --> 1712.2
yeah I could I could even do that

1709.92 --> 1714.0
without yeah without the astronauts and

1712.2 --> 1716.52
stuff it's it's when they're turning the

1714.0 --> 1717.81
camera it really it really gives the

1716.52 --> 1720.6299999999999
illusion that they're really up there

1717.81 --> 1722.1
but we see them screw up so much because

1720.63 --> 1723.8100000000002
they move the camera a certain way and

1722.1 --> 1725.9699999999998
you see the earth go concave and you

1723.81 --> 1727.8
gotta you gotta call them out on that

1725.97 --> 1729.48
and say you know what stop using the

1727.8 --> 1731.82
fisheye lens camera up there but it

1729.48 --> 1735.96
won't do it if they're fooling us one

1731.82 --> 1737.76
way or another and they've got they've

1735.96 --> 1740.58
it's a magic trick it's it's you know

1737.76 --> 1741.49
Penn & Teller do magic tricks all the

1740.58 --> 1743.47
time they

1741.49 --> 1745.179
Blayne David Copperfield these guys do

1743.47 --> 1747.22
magic tricks all the time and we could

1745.179 --> 1748.96
sit here for a long-ass time and try to

1747.22 --> 1751.57
figure out how to do some of these you

1748.96 --> 1754.179
know disappeared or an elephant or it is

1751.57 --> 1756.28
trickery just trick roots fashion studio

1754.179 --> 1761.23
trickery exact it's just a magic for me

1756.28 --> 1763.1499999999999
science fiction movies exactly exactly

1761.23 --> 1767.88
they just figured out how to do it live

1763.15 --> 1770.89
I mean I'm turning over new Leafs with

1767.88 --> 1773.71
just OBS you know like learning how to

1770.89 --> 1775.51
you know change my um my face and

1773.71 --> 1779.26
everything to look crazy like I did a

1775.51 --> 1781.32
minute ago this this kind of stuff I

1779.26 --> 1783.4
mean this is this is real-time graphics

1781.32 --> 1786.04
changing right in front your face I can

1783.4 --> 1787.9
I can do all kinds of stuff but this is

1786.04 --> 1790.9289999999999
just one little tool I'm sure they have

1787.9 --> 1795.8500000000001
tons of things at their disposal you

1790.929 --> 1798.22
know I could turn myself golden or piss

1795.85 --> 1802.54
yellow whatever whether you come to

1798.22 --> 1806.58
Temple Leslie attack these uh-huh all

1802.54 --> 1806.58

1839.74 --> 1843.85
people with what I do I know that what I

1841.45 --> 1847.3600000000001
do is effective at whatever is scale I

1843.85 --> 1848.7099999999998
do it sorry I'm killing bugs at these

1847.36 --> 1851.1999999999998
little I don't know what the hell kind

1848.71 --> 1852.94
of books this is weird-ass little brown

1851.2 --> 1855.3700000000001
bugs but anyway I'm trying to I'm trying

1852.94 --> 1858.16
to I'm trying to reach more and more

1855.37 --> 1860.6789999999999
people with what I do and it's working

1858.16 --> 1862.8400000000001
yesterday I was on you-now and I talked

1860.679 --> 1865.39
to that girl she had over fifty people

1862.84 --> 1866.9199999999998
in the chat and she was very interested

1865.39 --> 1869.3200000000002
in it and she actually invited me back

1866.92 --> 1870.79
on when I got done to talk about the

1869.32 --> 1872.5
other things that I do you know as far

1870.79 --> 1874.27
as energy healing and astral projection

1872.5 --> 1875.41
stuff cuz she looked at my profile and

1874.27 --> 1877.15
said oh you talk about others

1875.41 --> 1881.2
of to Wow I have to have you on again

1877.15 --> 1883.42
next time talk about some of that so and

1881.2 --> 1886.03
I and I was on when I started the stream

1883.42 --> 1887.77
with her I came on looking like looking

1886.03 --> 1890.62
like the creepy alien guy that I was

1887.77 --> 1892.72
showing you a minute ago so it doesn't

1890.62 --> 1895.1799999999998
matter if I'm in the the CNN news studio

1892.72 --> 1899.2
or the Tesla car or if I'm just trying

1895.18 --> 1901.96
to go full creep mode it it's an

1899.2 --> 1904.66
eye-catcher that people like and and and

1901.96 --> 1906.76
when you catch their attention you you

1904.66 --> 1909.6100000000001
got an int and that that's what I'm

1906.76 --> 1911.32
figuring out is I'm trying so many new

1909.61 --> 1913.9299999999998
things just to see if it works or not

1911.32 --> 1915.6399999999999
and everything I'm trying works and some

1913.93 --> 1917.71
of it's just better than the other and

1915.64 --> 1919.0
if I look too professional it's just not

1917.71 --> 1920.26
entertaining enough and they don't

1919.0 --> 1921.76
really care about what I'm talking about

1920.26 --> 1924.22
but if I'm doing some crazy stuff like

1921.76 --> 1926.08
this they're entertained just watching

1924.22 --> 1927.76
the you know the the different

1926.08 --> 1929.59
backgrounds change while I'm talking to

1927.76 --> 1932.16
them and there's they're still gonna

1929.59 --> 1934.6899999999998
like keep me keep being engaged with me

1932.16 --> 1937.0600000000002
so I'm finding out and I'm really trying

1934.69 --> 1938.5
new stuff and it's just for the sole

1937.06 --> 1940.03
purpose of keeping somebody's attention

1938.5 --> 1944.68
and flat smacking them and their

1940.03 --> 1946.81
audience it's working yeah yeah I've

1944.68 --> 1951.5800000000002
seen the results it's it's a really

1946.81 --> 1954.79
interesting thing that you do I feel

1951.58 --> 1958.72
that you're very effective because of

1954.79 --> 1961.33
everything combined how you act and the

1958.72 --> 1963.79
entertainment value and where you are

1961.33 --> 1966.97
combined that it works really well with

1963.79 --> 1968.71
new people for some reason like I said I

1966.97 --> 1974.38
don't do that it's like I have to be a

1968.71 --> 1976.75
lot more careful but yeah whether it's

1974.38 --> 1983.0200000000002
yeah if this I guess this really loose

1976.75 --> 1988.41
attitude also it helps to drink a couple

1983.02 --> 1992.92
of beers I read that because I know I

1988.41 --> 1995.98
know no my body is taking a toll for the

1992.92 --> 1999.3700000000001
flesh I can't do I don't know if I can

1995.98 --> 2001.17
do what I do sober I I first thought I

1999.37 --> 2003.54
don't feel like it that's the biggest

2001.17 --> 2005.46
thing that has me not doing it if I if I

2003.54 --> 2007.1399999999999
don't drink a beer or two I don't even I

2005.46 --> 2009.27
don't feel like flat smack and it's not

2007.14 --> 2012.3000000000002
it's not fun it doesn't

2009.27 --> 2014.04
so tight and I don't know my goofy self

2012.3 --> 2015.98
needs to come out because that's where

2014.04 --> 2018.96
it's the entertaining value comes from

2015.98 --> 2021.8700000000001
that's why sometimes like lately

2018.96 --> 2023.52
I'll just start streaming games while I

2021.87 --> 2025.4699999999998
drink my first beer or two and then by

2023.52 --> 2026.97
the third beer I'm like done with my

2025.47 --> 2029.46
game and I'm like okay now it's time to

2026.97 --> 2030.93
flat smack and I think that's the rhythm

2029.46 --> 2033.72
that I've been falling into the past

2030.93 --> 2035.69
couple of weeks and then I'm still fun

2033.72 --> 2040.23
flat smacking people on the games do

2035.69 --> 2043.1100000000001
just just because you know had a guy on

2040.23 --> 2045.0
Twitch tonight that found me I was just

2043.11 --> 2046.86
doing of just a pure gaming stream like

2045.0 --> 2049.38

2046.86 --> 2051.24

2049.38 --> 2052.679

2051.24 --> 2054.7799999999997

2218.04 --> 2224.97
problem in my brain that like if it's if

2228.69 --> 2231.27
you you have a thick accent any kind of

2230.64 --> 2233.94
way

2241.77 --> 2247.95
it about myself myself when I hear there

2245.4 --> 2251.1600000000003
I've been listening to the special shows

2247.95 --> 2253.5299999999997

2251.16 --> 2256.98
when II when the globe Busters show is

2253.53 --> 2259.8
on yo half a pig asses it's not so much

2256.98 --> 2262.5
as a thick accent but his struggle song

2259.8 --> 2264.8100000000004
on learning the world's the phrasing and

2262.5 --> 2267.75

2264.81 --> 2270.42
the right way so he he throw a lot of

2267.75 --> 2275.43
boo-boos in the synthesis region over

2270.42 --> 2276.9900000000002
here like I was thinking about you

2275.43 --> 2279.27

2276.99 --> 2282.72

be an entertainment factor it's

2354.089 --> 2358.049
definitely a byproduct but I'm trying to

2356.43 --> 2361.319
learn more and more about the flat earth

2358.049 --> 2363.839
and learn more and more what what really

2361.319 --> 2365.49
reaches people what Wow's them and what

2363.839 --> 2367.349
makes their hampster start turning their

2365.49 --> 2370.2299999999996
wheel I'm trying to figure out the most

2367.349 --> 2373.829
impactful things to say to people every

2370.23 --> 2376.049
time I flat smack so and and one of the

2373.829 --> 2379.079
things I'm learning is like the effects

2376.049 --> 2381.75
that I have is eye-catching and the I

2379.079 --> 2383.6600000000003
catch factor is really what has people

2381.75 --> 2386.549
wanting to listen to what I have to say

2383.66 --> 2390.54
like if I can just wow them with special

2386.549 --> 2393.03
effects it it they're interested enough

2390.54 --> 2396.7799999999997
to hear the rest of what I'm gonna say

2393.03 --> 2398.549
to them yeah that's why I like to kind

2396.78 --> 2401.2200000000003
of go overboard with my effects and

2398.549 --> 2403.2
stuff and and I have a lot of fun doing

2401.22 --> 2406.77
all these different effects I'm getting

2403.2 --> 2408.4399999999996
new ones every day yeah you got the

2406.77 --> 2410.15
computer if you know how to do the

2408.44 --> 2411.8
little tricks and effect all you need is

2410.15 --> 2414.17
a pretty much a big screen and a couple

2411.8 --> 2417.349
programs you know cheap and free you can

2414.17 --> 2419.109
get it yeah more power to you versus

2417.349 --> 2421.88
keep doing what you're doing and and

2419.109 --> 2422.75
building on top of what you get yeah

2421.88 --> 2425.119
that's amazing

2422.75 --> 2426.4
yeah it's awesome I never seen this one

2425.119 --> 2430.4900000000002
with the smoke and the fire before

2426.4 --> 2432.079
pretty cool good stuff yeah I could I

2430.49 --> 2433.43
could just be boring like sitting here

2432.079 --> 2435.5600000000004
in my living room or something but

2433.43 --> 2439.81

2435.56 --> 2439.81
for you get it yes spice it up right

2441.069 --> 2444.619
but I've messed with people like that

2443.06 --> 2447.89
too I'll be sitting there in the living

2444.619 --> 2451.19
room and I'll be like I'll be like hey

in a small monitor they couldn't get the

2476.66 --> 2481.0989999999997
difference if it's like CGI your green

2478.579 --> 2483.8
screen is my brain playing three

2481.099 --> 2485.3590000000004

when you play your video so let me share

2510.02 --> 2512.9
the video with you guys and you just

2511.28 --> 2514.73
gotta kind of step to the side a little

2512.9 --> 2519.65
bit and you can point like the

2514.73 --> 2521.66
weatherman you know mm-hmm yeah I'm

2519.65 --> 2523.64
always looking for new stuff to do my

2521.66 --> 2525.74
next thing I'm gonna let y'all in on the

2523.64 --> 2528.859
on the secret coming off is on my next

2525.74 --> 2531.589
thing I'm gonna do is have recordings of

2528.859 --> 2534.5299999999997
me pop in my own stream and I'll

2531.589 --> 2536.48
interact with myself and and and blow

2534.53 --> 2539.75
myself up or something like like maybe

2536.48 --> 2540.59
I'll come in and I crash my own show and

2539.75 --> 2543.17
be like

2540.59 --> 2544.8500000000004
not flat you bastard and then I'll be

2543.17 --> 2552.05
like uh-uh and I'll hit a button and

2544.85 --> 2555.3199999999997
like it'll blow up and just record a

2552.05 --> 2558.26
bunch of like a fun fact and little

2555.32 --> 2560.84
nuggets of knowledge also like let's see

2558.26 --> 2563.2700000000004
what they you know what the fun fact of

2560.84 --> 2564.56
today is hurry or whatever you know just

2563.27 --> 2566.39
make nice and you're coming with a

2564.56 --> 2575.7799999999997
little different wig or different

2566.39 --> 2579.5299999999997
glasses or the mustache into an entire

2575.78 --> 2581.42
play if you'd like yeah you know that's

2579.53 --> 2584.8100000000004
that's pretty easy to set different

2581.42 --> 2587.4500000000003
characters that you are I've seen many

2584.81 --> 2590.27
people do it really well you could do it

2587.45 --> 2591.08
I could show and they do it I can

2590.27 --> 2594.67
totally do that

2591.08 --> 2597.92
I've actually I guess I got several

2594.67 --> 2600.38
bookmarks on my browser I was looking up

2597.92 --> 2602.78
different masquerade masks and there's a

2600.38 --> 2604.82
set of eight different masks that see

2602.78 --> 2606.53
this one has this one covers my mouth

2604.82 --> 2608.48
and you hear how it muffles my beliefs

2606.53 --> 2611.09
but I'm gonna get masks that don't have

2608.48 --> 2613.46
the lower half so all these crazy like

2611.09 --> 2614.9900000000002
half masks and and and all these other

2613.46 --> 2617.42
thing I'm gonna get like a pack of eight

2614.99 --> 2619.2799999999997
and I might come wearing different

2617.42 --> 2621.11
masquerade masks or something like that

2619.28 --> 2623.8700000000003
and do what Jose said that's a great

2621.11 --> 2626.6600000000003

2635.06 --> 2639.17
smoke you know yeah that's how everybody

2637.34 --> 2641.54
grows you know just grab all their

2639.17 --> 2643.76
little advices that you get left and

2641.54 --> 2645.77
right and then you evolve them to make

2643.76 --> 2648.8900000000003
him yourself you know and work around

2645.77 --> 2650.96
him yeah not bad at all that's cool I'm

2756.259 --> 2762.079
either staying awake for a whole lot of

2759.799 --> 2764.029
time just to reset it or I just sleep

2762.079 --> 2765.3390000000004
for a whole lot just to reset it I don't

2764.029 --> 2769.13
know what's gonna happen first

2765.339 --> 2775.0389999999998
but yeah I'm definitely off kilter right

2769.13 --> 2778.94
now it is a special kind of activism if

2775.039 --> 2782.2690000000002

this Mac for it's a special kind of

2797.539 --> 2802.789
things you know it's funny just to look

2799.519 --> 2804.109
at just your reactions just your

2802.789 --> 2805.6090000000004
reactions when you jump in the Sun in

2804.109 --> 2807.52
the world let me get the magnifier and

2805.609 --> 2809.35
all this little stuff

2807.52 --> 2811.0
when you get to the bottom of it when

2809.35 --> 2813.67
the people decide to show their faces

2811.0 --> 2816.1
and you can see the spark in their eyes

2813.67 --> 2817.6
and and they look into the left look

2816.1 --> 2819.79
into the right you know you make them

2817.6 --> 2822.1
think it's not gonna change their lives

2819.79 --> 2824.2
in the moment because in 10 or 15

2822.1 --> 2826.21
minutes your interaction it's not gonna

2824.2 --> 2829.54
change them forever but they might have

2826.21 --> 2831.76
even a dream that night on whatever you

2829.54 --> 2833.17
planted the seed on them and the next

2831.76 --> 2835.96
day they're bored around and then

2833.17 --> 2837.82
they're gonna get recommended some kind

2835.96 --> 2840.16
of conspiracy about the moon landing so

2837.82 --> 2841.48
NASA or whatever and they click on it

2840.16 --> 2843.43
and they're gonna continue they're gonna

2841.48 --> 2844.54
remember you so yeah you do anything I

2843.43 --> 2847.0899999999997
appreciate it thank you

2847.09 --> 2851.2000000000003

video the other day to talk about I plan

2861.49 --> 2866.29
to do this full-time I'm aiming to do

2863.95 --> 2869.3799999999997
this full-time I'm aiming to make a

2866.29 --> 2871.48
living wage doing this and it's not

2869.38 --> 2874.42
going to be coming solely from the Flat

2871.48 --> 2878.14
Earth family I see that a lot of support

2874.42 --> 2880.3
is coming from the Flat Earth family and

2878.14 --> 2882.8199999999997
even financial support my patreon

2880.3 --> 2884.8590000000004
accounts now up to $30 a month in just

2882.82 --> 2888.369
two days since I started putting it out

2884.859 --> 2892.119
so a lot of supports coming through but

2888.369 --> 2894.04
I when I make this new channel I'm gonna

2892.119 --> 2895.42
be asking for patreon support for this

2894.04 --> 2897.91
new channel and these people are gonna

2895.42 --> 2899.65
probably be patreon for me because I'm

2897.91 --> 2901.6299999999997
just entertaining the hell out of them

2899.65 --> 2903.31
they won't know they're getting flat

2901.63 --> 2907.35
smacked like it's gonna be a subliminal

2903.31 --> 2909.88
programming thing I'm doing to him but I

2907.35 --> 2911.29
you know I want to do this full-time

2909.88 --> 2913.06
like I'm learning every day more and

2911.29 --> 2914.71
more about OBS or more and more about

2913.06 --> 2916.18
what's effective and flat smacking and

2914.71 --> 2918.58
and more and more about how to advertise

2916.18 --> 2921.58
myself and do some learning and learning

2918.58 --> 2923.3199999999997
and learning so fast and I have my

2921.58 --> 2925.9
little patreon set for like a dollar a

2923.32 --> 2928.869
month donation so that's like 12 bucks a

2925.9 --> 2932.32
year to to see me do what I do for

2928.869 --> 2934.51
people that could afford it and it's

2932.32 --> 2936.52
just I know that I'm gonna catch a lot

2934.51 --> 2938.5
of slack people are black people are

2936.52 --> 2939.52
gonna be like Oh Horry oh you shouldn't

3087.7 --> 3092.5589999999997
in chat saying you have no respect for

3090.309 --> 3095.3190000000004
young ladies your mother would be

3092.559 --> 3097.0890000000004

3095.319 --> 3102.609
the chat room right there telling her to

3097.089 --> 3105.099
shut the F up so yeah yeah this little a

3102.609 --> 3106.839
beautiful dancer Zelda she kind of you

3105.099 --> 3107.829
know did a little bit of a Robin and she

3106.839 --> 3109.8089999999997
touches yourself

3107.829 --> 3112.599
nothing not into extreme you know just a

3109.809 --> 3114.4300000000003
little sexy and then then the the lady

3112.599 --> 3116.349

you know you respect you're a decent man

3118.599 --> 3122.9500000000003
and whatever went down and I think

3120.49 --> 3126.5789999999997
whatever she did do you got Horry a

3122.95 --> 3129.0389999999998
strike yeah I mean maybe I took it a

3126.579 --> 3130.7200000000003
little far maybe I stuck my hand over

3129.039 --> 3134.71
there like I was touching her too I

3130.72 --> 3136.6299999999997
don't remember I had too many beers but

3134.71 --> 3137.17
whatever I was doing it was just all in

3136.63 --> 3138.549
good fun

3137.17 --> 3141.88
it wasn't anything there was no you know

3138.549 --> 3143.349
nothing crazy but she she bitched and

3141.88 --> 3144.789
moaned a little bit too hard and I know

3143.349 --> 3146.17
she gave me a strike and then somebody

3144.789 --> 3147.76
else might have gave me a strike just

3146.17 --> 3149.5
because they were trolling me anyway and

3147.76 --> 3151.4500000000003
that's it you know YouTube has their

3149.5 --> 3153.069
little policies I was looking on Twitch

3151.45 --> 3155.3489999999997
last night somebody made a video about

3153.069 --> 3157.359
twitch streamers that got banned and and

3155.349 --> 3160.7200000000003
what they got banned for and I'll tell

3157.359 --> 3165.88
you what man I mean they will ban you on

3160.72 --> 3167.5
twitch for almost anything it seems so a

3165.88 --> 3170.1400000000003
YouTube might be following the similar

3167.5 --> 3172.39
policy but I didn't do anything to

3170.14 --> 3174.069
deserve it and I haven't stopped

3172.39 --> 3175.839
I still got is how this still comes out

3174.069 --> 3179.619
of her now and then because you know I

3175.839 --> 3181.569
got cojones but yeah it was you dit and

3179.619 --> 3183.819
and she didn't want any friends believe

3181.569 --> 3185.619
me she she lost a lot of support I know

3183.819 --> 3187.119
she lost subs I know that a lot of

3185.619 --> 3188.349
people that she used to talk to don't

3187.119 --> 3190.63
want to talk to her anymore

3188.349 --> 3192.819
and that's what that's what happens when

3190.63 --> 3197.17
you you know do something stupid like

3192.819 --> 3198.46
that indeed yeah I didn't know what she

3197.17 --> 3200.619
was I heard her voice

3198.46 --> 3203.29
say I think I heard this voice before in

3200.619 --> 3206.859
like the Sun and Moon family and I

3203.29 --> 3209.2599999999998
always imagined her like a like one of

3206.859 --> 3221.589
those with the big hat and a crystal

3209.26 --> 3223.329
ball like yeah exactly I used to like

3221.589 --> 3225.25
her I mean now I had no problem with her

3223.329 --> 3228.4
I couldn't understand half the [Â __Â ] she

3225.25 --> 3230.47
was ever telling me so I didn't ever get

3228.4 --> 3232.42
too close to her because of that but now

3230.47 --> 3234.8489999999997
that she did this to me I'm flying the

3232.42 --> 3236.319
gloves are off and crazy old bat wait

3234.849 --> 3238.21
till I put her in the Tesla space

3236.319 --> 3242.19
background I'm gonna take that picture

3238.21 --> 3245.5
and it's gonna it's gonna in amoral eyes

3242.19 --> 3247.51
in lower life and mortal eyes right it's

3245.5 --> 3248.95
gonna immortalize that event because I'm

3247.51 --> 3250.869
gonna take that same picture I showed

3248.95 --> 3253.72
you and it's gonna fly past me in the

3250.869 --> 3258.04
Tesla car and her ass is gonna know

3253.72 --> 3260.6499999999996
exactly who it is she can't say [Â __Â ]

3258.04 --> 3267.22
about it she can't strike me for it like

3260.65 --> 3270.01
yeah yeah be careful know them I'll do

3267.22 --> 3271.6899999999996
it after my band so if I get my if I get

3270.01 --> 3273.88
much if I get another strike it's just

3271.69 --> 3276.16
90 more days and I'll learn that lesson

3273.88 --> 3277.69
as well and I'll just keep doing what

3276.16 --> 3280.1189999999997
I'm doing because again I'm not here to

3277.69 --> 3282.01
I'm not here I don't necessarily have to

3280.119 --> 3283.48
have 60 or 70 people in my room when I

3282.01 --> 3285.5490000000004
do my live streams on the Horry sheet

3283.48 --> 3288.43
main channel I have anywhere from you

3285.549 --> 3290.89
know 20 to 70 people but I'm on flats

3288.43 --> 3293.47
Macker live and I still have 26 to 30

3290.89 --> 3295.299
people that's that's fine with me as

3293.47 --> 3297.3999999999996
long as I have like at least 20 people

3295.299 --> 3300.04
like I'm I'm cool and having fun in the

3297.4 --> 3301.78
chat anything less and it feels like I

3300.04 --> 3303.579
don't even need to hit the live button I

3301.78 --> 3305.3190000000004
could just do my own thing but I like to

3303.579 --> 3307.8390000000004
I like to go laughs people do like like

3305.319 --> 3310.7799999999997
to watch and of course you know I I get

3307.839 --> 3313.21
the the support really helps me to keep

3310.78 --> 3314.5890000000004

3313.21 --> 3316.15

3316.15 --> 3322.599

I got 768 right now so approaching the

3357.19 --> 3362.049

3362.049 --> 3367.42
early bird edition before the flower

3379.869 --> 3384.4300000000003
well like the whole show is they set up

3382.51 --> 3388.38
is very flexible we can go any direction

3384.43 --> 3391.45
just as long as the things don't get

3388.38 --> 3393.309
disgusting or really agitating in some

3391.45 --> 3396.97
way because hey people are eating their

3393.309 --> 3400.9900000000002
breakfast so they want to like wake up

3396.97 --> 3403.39
slowly and don't get like like choke on

3400.99 --> 3405.069
their coffee that kind of [Â __Â ] that's

3403.39 --> 3410.41
the that's the plan that's basically the

3405.069 --> 3412.569
only real rules so no talking about is

3410.41 --> 3414.819
drinking that kind of I got another

3412.569 --> 3416.319
quick idea I got another quick idea for

3414.819 --> 3417.549
hurry before I lose you because I don't

3416.319 --> 3420.069
know we're not gonna talk to you again

3417.549 --> 3422.02
Oh as our wing was talking and I was

3420.069 --> 3423.39
talking I saw you there you were a mute

3422.02 --> 3425.89
and you were just sitting and listening

3423.39 --> 3429.04
doing this little bit of subtle movement

3425.89 --> 3431.02
when and now do this now you can you can

3429.04 --> 3433.54
when the show ends just record yourself

3431.02 --> 3435.46
for like two minutes just looking at the

3433.54 --> 3437.5589999999997
screen and like typing in the keyboard

3435.46 --> 3439.03
we call yourself and save that clip

3437.559 --> 3441.67
whenever you gotta go to the bathroom

3439.03 --> 3443.1090000000004
next time they say alright guys so I'll

3441.67 --> 3444.91
go mute for a second I gotta do some

3443.109 --> 3447.549
stuff in the computer and you can just

3444.91 --> 3450.3999999999996
hit the play button you know flip the

3447.549 --> 3452.65
little video on on the viewers and you

3450.4 --> 3453.9700000000003
can run to the bathroom every anybody is

3452.65 --> 3455.44
gonna even know that you are gone

3453.97 --> 3460.1189999999997
everybody's gonna think you're still

3455.44 --> 3462.549
sitting in there you know I could

3460.119 --> 3464.6800000000003
certainly do that and and hell but it's

3462.549 --> 3465.25
if I did implement that then when I

3464.68 --> 3467.8599999999997
actually

3465.25 --> 3470.43
come back I can make that person blow up

3467.86 --> 3473.71
and then me just kind of reappear like

3470.43 --> 3474.54
do some stupid stuff with it that's

3473.71 --> 3477.25
hilarious

3474.54 --> 3479.38
yeah I know that idea you can think

3477.25 --> 3481.27
about it yet I could fool people with

3479.38 --> 3482.83
that I can make them think that I could

3481.27 --> 3484.84
just say hold on guys let me do

3482.83 --> 3486.2799999999997
something real quick and and I'll put

3484.84 --> 3487.7200000000003
the video on and it'll look like I

3486.28 --> 3489.61
didn't really do anything but I'm still

3487.72 --> 3491.29
sitting there typing or whatever and I

3489.61 --> 3495.1
go pee or grab a beer or whatever I'm

3491.29 --> 3497.38
come back impossible it basically indeed

3495.1 --> 3500.29
do something on your computer record it

3497.38 --> 3503.26
like and then make it into a loop for

3500.29 --> 3514.7799999999997
like five seconds so you just seem like

3503.26 --> 3516.2200000000003
you're doing stuff they're like KK more

3514.78 --> 3519.13
punching or whatever and they hear all

3516.22 --> 3520.33
these choice you know explodes I don't

3519.13 --> 3522.9700000000003
know what he was talking about but that

3520.33 --> 3525.2799999999997
wasn't me you know yeah with this stuff

3522.97 --> 3529.87
I'm all about like blowing people's mind

3525.28 --> 3532.69
and making them think is that true

3529.87 --> 3533.44
that's amazing I love I think the wow

3532.69 --> 3535.84
factor

3533.44 --> 3538.84
I live for the wow factor and and of

3535.84 --> 3541.6800000000003
course to be funny I don't know I like

3538.84 --> 3547.1800000000003
being funny but that's a good idea

3541.68 --> 3553.1099999999997
