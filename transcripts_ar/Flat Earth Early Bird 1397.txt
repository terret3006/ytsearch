[Music]

268.88 --> 275.1
I went to bed really early last night

276.02 --> 282.0
[Music]

278.699 --> 285.18

time it's weird

287.22 --> 294.199
what the hell is up with this freaking

289.919 --> 294.19899999999996

295.56 --> 298.639
[Music]

306.54 --> 311.52000000000004
I mean if this keeps up I I might need

309.18 --> 314.34000000000003
to get a new camera because this is just

311.52 --> 316.56
getting so annoying and it isn't the

314.34 --> 317.82
freaking USB connection it's the camera

316.56 --> 321.3
itself

317.82 --> 325.09999999999997
it's it's the wire

321.3 --> 325.1
the wire is kind of shitty

325.139 --> 330.12
I mean how long have I have this cam for

327.84 --> 335.29999999999995
like two years or something

330.12 --> 335.3
three years it should not be doing this

337.64 --> 342.18
[Music]

340.08 --> 345.539
do you tear Professor Phil another one

342.18 --> 348.6
yeah I even tried to hold back but he

345.539 --> 351.539
was just really pushing it

348.6 --> 354.36
and did you also see the comments

351.539 --> 357.0
the trolls left in the chat they all

354.36 --> 359.1
doubled down again

357.0 --> 363.08
they can't help it it's it doesn't

359.1 --> 366.78000000000003
matter how [ __ ] a narrative is

363.08 --> 370.52
if I'm against it then it must be true

366.78 --> 370.52
according to some of these numpties

370.56 --> 375.419
even though I'm just analyzing it in

373.38 --> 379.199
detail utterly

375.419 --> 381.979
and they just they will not listen they

379.199 --> 381.979
will not listen

385.14 --> 388.31
[Music]

396.139 --> 402.44
okay Richard well that's not a really

399.72 --> 402.44000000000005
good entry

403.8 --> 408.84000000000003
yeah getting in the chat for the first

406.8 --> 411.3
time and then telling me what to do

408.84 --> 412.79999999999995
that's not a good entry that's a gamma

411.3 --> 415.44
entry

412.8 --> 418.5
give you a chance to correct that

415.44 --> 421.16
but usually I ban people for those types

418.5 --> 421.16
of actions

424.71 --> 430.46
[Music]

426.66 --> 430.46000000000004
you can get the [ __ ] out

438.979 --> 444.419
watched it all right yeah it was it was

442.199 --> 448.139
a really good show yesterday I thought

444.419 --> 451.21999999999997
very fluid very on point very technical

448.139 --> 451.22
and interesting

452.819 --> 458.46000000000004
I mean I even remember vaguely how at

456.84 --> 460.85999999999996
the time when it was rolled out a little

458.46 --> 463.13899999999995
global warming and how does it work

460.86 --> 466.319
I was much younger when I first heard

463.139 --> 468.419
that and then I went all technical on I

466.319 --> 469.97900000000004
think the teacher or somebody that was

468.419 --> 473.4
like

469.979 --> 477.84
person promoting that nonsense

473.4 --> 480.29999999999995
and they would try to very roughly

477.84 --> 482.65999999999997
outline what it was supposed to be like

480.3 --> 482.66
but

483.9 --> 488.88
it didn't make any sense and there were

486.539 --> 491.4
a lot of questions that literally I

488.88 --> 493.68
asked when I was like that was like when

491.4 --> 496.44
I was seven or eight

493.68 --> 499.5
which the people that were representing

496.44 --> 503.699
it literally had no clue about

499.5 --> 506.52
whatsoever like they didn't know

503.699 --> 508.08000000000004
what I was asking about and that was

506.52 --> 510.35999999999996
kind of frustrating to them because I

508.08 --> 514.68
was a very little kid

510.36 --> 517.38
right well yesterday I rolled it out

514.68 --> 519.12
very similarly to what I was doing when

517.38 --> 521.58
I was much younger even though I did not

519.12 --> 524.339
really know about gas Dynamics all that

521.58 --> 526.26
much but I already had a feel like I

524.339 --> 529.0400000000001
need to know exactly what is this how

526.26 --> 529.04
does this work

529.74 --> 534.8
and I just yeah analyzed it in detail

532.5 --> 534.8
yesterday

535.8 --> 541.3199999999999
and

537.779 --> 543.24
the only solution Professor Bill Bell

541.32 --> 547.98
and the others that were going against

543.24 --> 550.6800000000001
it had the ridiculous assertion that

547.98 --> 553.2
heat from the Sun

550.68 --> 558.66
keeps that

553.2 --> 562.44
like higher density gas in its place

558.66 --> 565.56
in between lower density gases

562.44 --> 567.24
sort of the idea like a cloud sitting

565.56 --> 571.0799999999999
upon the air

567.24 --> 573.44
but that's absolutely ridiculous

571.08 --> 575.64
and there's no

573.44 --> 577.98
demonstration of that that is even

575.64 --> 582.14
possible

577.98 --> 582.14
so it's all [ __ ]

590.94 --> 593.82
yeah he keeps gadgets together kind of

593.16 --> 597.24
like

593.82 --> 601.2600000000001
the giant Fireball sun right I mean that

597.24 --> 601.26
it's constantly exploding

602.1 --> 607.44
with like a thousand nuclear bombs or

605.1 --> 609.36
whatever I don't even know how much the

607.44 --> 611.94
supposed numerical value of that

609.36 --> 614.7
nonsense assertion is

611.94 --> 615.9200000000001
but yet that exploding is what keeps the

614.7 --> 621.38
gases

615.92 --> 621.38
somehow yes perfect logic

623.12 --> 628.279
[Music]

632.06 --> 637.8
yeah hey [ __ ] nut

644.04 --> 648.959

646.68 --> 651.42
presented me with anything

648.959 --> 654.0
no evidence

651.42 --> 657.06
no actual measurement

654.0 --> 660.18
it was all horseshit and I rebutted

657.06 --> 661.38
every single potential option you could

660.18 --> 663.5999999999999
have gone at

661.38 --> 667.26
which you didn't even do

663.6 --> 669.5400000000001
I did it for you preemptively to show

667.26 --> 671.7
you how it would have been wrong if you

669.54 --> 674.2199999999999
said anything because it's [ __ ]

671.7 --> 679.0790000000001
[ __ ] and all you people that believe

674.22 --> 682.399
that [ __ ] are [ __ ] out of your mind

679.079 --> 682.399

because you gotta really search to find

862.2 --> 865.88

the secret society Network

1082.82 --> 1088.1599999999999
video about secret societies it was very

1086.84 --> 1090.62
basic

but good

1090.62 --> 1095.1789999999999

1146.299 --> 1152.24
new standard of okay yeah I think it's

1148.52 --> 1155.96
all [ __ ] there is no such thing

1152.24 --> 1158.36
it's either the corporate system is

1155.96 --> 1161.26
trying to push it

1158.36 --> 1164.6
Bankers are trying to push it everybody

1161.26 --> 1168.8799999999999
in power is trying to push it

1164.6 --> 1172.059
but we don't actually need to comply

1168.88 --> 1172.0590000000002
at all

1175.7 --> 1179.26
it's November

1187.78 --> 1192.6789999999999

1190.64 --> 1196.16

1192.679 --> 1198.5590000000002

new con currency I mean they're gonna

1198.559 --> 1202.3999999999999

1199.82 --> 1206.059
this is already happening

1202.4 --> 1210.0800000000002
this is already happening right now

1206.059 --> 1212.66
attempts of rollout of new currencies

1210.08 --> 1214.52
to get a lot of people on board they

1212.66 --> 1216.6200000000001
just want a big Mass on board of that

1214.52 --> 1220.22
new currency

1216.62 --> 1223.1599999999999

1247.82 --> 1251.32
since like the 80s

1251.419 --> 1256.5800000000002
[ __ ]

1253.94 --> 1259.94
it's all [ __ ] there is no currency

1256.58 --> 1261.86
rollout it's all hype hype hype hype

1259.94 --> 1264.2

1261.86 --> 1267.6399999999999
just believe it I don't know if you

1264.2 --> 1267.64
heard about the forced currency

1268.24 --> 1273.2
there's no puking their guts out because

1271.039 --> 1276.62
they don't have anything

1273.2 --> 1279.38
it's all lies all [ __ ] trying to

1276.62 --> 1284.0
indoctrinate you until you start to

1279.38 --> 1286.0390000000002
Parrot like a sheep oh we're gonna get a

1284.0 --> 1289.159
new currency we're gonna have to

1286.039 --> 1290.6589999999999
cooperate with the new currency that's

1289.159 --> 1292.7600000000002
what they're trying to do they're trying

1290.659 --> 1294.7990000000002
to force it in your head

1292.76 --> 1298.039
because they expect that you're all

1294.799 --> 1301.1589999999999
[ __ ] enough to just do it

1298.039 --> 1303.559
because they say so because they think

1301.159 --> 1306.7600000000002
you're [ __ ]

1303.559 --> 1306.76
that's what's happening

1306.88 --> 1314.96
is no forcing of a new currency

1312.08 --> 1316.8799999999999
yeah not everybody knows this

1314.96 --> 1320.14
there is no gold [ __ ] there's

1316.88 --> 1320.14
there's plenty of gold

1320.299 --> 1326.6589999999999
just America doesn't have any because

1322.94 --> 1328.64
they stole it all from themselves

1326.659 --> 1329.8400000000001
like the people within the governments

1328.64 --> 1332.419
they're just

1329.84 --> 1333.9189999999999
yeah I mean American government has been

1332.419 --> 1336.0200000000002
looting

1333.919 --> 1338.7800000000002
their own people

1336.02 --> 1342.1589999999999
and their own Nation for

1338.78 --> 1342.1589999999999
over half a century

1342.2 --> 1347.44
maybe even for like straight out a

1344.12 --> 1347.4399999999998
century so

1348.559 --> 1351.9189999999999
but yeah there's still plenty of

1350.24 --> 1356.44
countries that have

1351.919 --> 1356.44
central banks with a lot of gold so

1356.659 --> 1361.16
no

1357.97 --> 1361.16
[Music]

1365.78 --> 1369.799
yeah so spend the gold standard what

1367.88 --> 1373.1000000000001
that was for the banking system

1369.799 --> 1376.52
the problem was is that they also then

1373.1 --> 1380.299
stole all the gold they didn't need to

1376.52 --> 1382.1589999999999
show it anymore to be able to function

1380.299 --> 1386.44
as a bank

1382.159 --> 1386.44
so then they just stole it

1390.74 --> 1394.88
right all they needed was a Fort Knox

1393.14 --> 1397.2800000000002
myth

1394.88 --> 1400.4
and it's infinite gold thanks to

1397.28 --> 1403.1789999999999
Goldfinger to reinforce that little

1400.4 --> 1403.179
fake out

1412.64 --> 1417.14
yeah so I don't know what you're

1414.44 --> 1418.94
squirting about Dorian Gray there's no

1417.14 --> 1423.0200000000002
Universal

1418.94 --> 1423.02
currency coming [ __ ]

1427.7 --> 1434.02
that they're trying to they're gonna try

1429.5 --> 1438.02
to guess like you into just doing it

1434.02 --> 1440.299
when they offer it oh look this can be

1438.02 --> 1442.76
the universal currency you just have to

1440.299 --> 1445.8799999999999
sign on oh we'll give you a lot of stuff

1442.76 --> 1447.559
or Summit

1445.88 --> 1448.8200000000002
and then probably I'll have to pay it

1447.559 --> 1452.24
back and then you can't and then you're

1448.82 --> 1454.8999999999999
in debt forever something like that

1452.24 --> 1454.9
so

1456.98 --> 1461.02
there's no universal currency coming

1461.24 --> 1464.86
there's no basic income coming

1466.1 --> 1473.8999999999999
all of that is all horseshit

1470.539 --> 1477.2
nobody can force it upon you the only

1473.9 --> 1480.5590000000002
thing they can do to get it through is

1477.2 --> 1483.02
have retards beg for it and then those

1480.559 --> 1485.71
retards will get it

1483.02 --> 1503.74
that is all

1485.71 --> 1507.26
[Music]

1503.74 --> 1509.48

1507.26 --> 1512.48
Up by even mentioning it all you're

1509.48 --> 1515.3600000000001
doing is effectively spreading

enthusiasm whether it's fear-based

1515.36 --> 1522.1
enthusiasm

1516.98 --> 1522.1

not me I'm a man well you brought it up

1526.88 --> 1531.0200000000002
then you brought it up you brought it up

1528.799 --> 1533.779
from the start you're being very

1531.02 --> 1537.2
enthusiastic about it

1533.779 --> 1538.88

1537.2 --> 1541.88
Dorian Gray

1541.88 --> 1547.6000000000001

1544.64 --> 1547.6000000000001
spinning in your head

1547.7 --> 1553.779
this is the remedy of this system what

that were held back by that thing not

1574.34 --> 1577.12
being addressed

1594.74 --> 1601.279
and if you're against it well okay fine

1598.82 --> 1604.279
don't panic

1601.279 --> 1609.38
you're against it oh really prove it to

1604.279 --> 1612.4
me don't panic about it don't get hyped

1609.38 --> 1612.4

1615.799 --> 1620.84
you really support it then whatever your

censoring people of Parliament

1734.539 --> 1740.179

1737.539 --> 1742.4
that is absolutely illegal and has never

1740.179 --> 1743.8400000000001
happened before in the entire history of

1742.4 --> 1745.5800000000002
the Netherlands

1743.84 --> 1749.48
and that's just happened

1745.58 --> 1751.76
people are being forbidden people that

1749.48 --> 1754.34

1757.94 --> 1764.48
forbidden to actually participate so

elected officials have been excluded

1764.48 --> 1770.72
from partaking in procedures

that's happening over here

another country okay why the hell would

2115.839 --> 2121.2999999999997
you expect that I would be able to even

say anything about that at all

2121.3 --> 2123.96
yes

2124.9 --> 2130.78
I probably could but it's just

now compared to the way he looked a half

2259.06 --> 2262.839
a year ago he looks really bad

2261.58 --> 2267.0
[Music]

2262.839 --> 2267.0
like not in control

2267.46 --> 2274.0
like with a big clownish smile that's

2271.18 --> 2277.3799999999997
just I can see the pain

2274.0 --> 2277.38
so he's not doing good

2299.26 --> 2308.26
UK PM she looked no I'm talking I'm

2302.74 --> 2308.2599999999998
Dutch Dorian Gray the Netherlands

2309.099 --> 2312.099
ah

2316.18 --> 2323.9199999999996
I mean do I need to just have a Dutch

2320.2 --> 2327.06
flag in your face

2323.92 --> 2327.06
for seven years

2334.48 --> 2339.7
all of them that's what's the name yeah

2337.119 --> 2344.1400000000003
but the UK prime minister is just fresh

2339.7 --> 2346.72
in so you can't compare that to rata

2344.14 --> 2348.2799999999997
which has been sitting here for like I

2346.72 --> 2350.56
don't know how long it must have been

2348.28 --> 2355.38
like eight years or something this guy

2350.56 --> 2355.38
has been in power for a long time

2357.4 --> 2360.7200000000003
maybe even longer

2369.52 --> 2374.14
but yeah he's just getting annihilated

2372.22 --> 2377.14
right now

2374.14 --> 2379.7799999999997
because

2377.14 --> 2382.54
well because of the vaccination

2379.78 --> 2384.579
situation coming out of all this the

2382.54 --> 2389.079
admittance from the Pfizer director that

2384.579 --> 2390.88
it didn't actually prevent the spread

2389.079 --> 2394.6600000000003
at all

2390.88 --> 2397.2400000000002
and this is like really crushing down on

2394.66 --> 2400.2999999999997
them now and I really think like our

2397.24 --> 2405.1189999999997
cabinet might might just fall

2400.3 --> 2405.119
I mean they're right now now now

2405.78 --> 2411.4
forbidding people in the Parliament that

2409.359 --> 2415.48
are all elected

2411.4 --> 2417.88
like seriously elected from being able

2415.48 --> 2421.72
to speak

2417.88 --> 2425.4
because they say so

2421.72 --> 2425.3999999999996
that is just

2425.619 --> 2430.0
well that's like a coup that is

2428.38 --> 2434.6400000000003
happening right now

2430.0 --> 2434.64
in the Netherlands right now

2436.3 --> 2440.619
I don't really give a [ __ ] what's

2438.22 --> 2442.54
happening in England and all that

2440.619 --> 2444.28
they gotta just take care of themselves

2442.54 --> 2447.18
man

2444.28 --> 2447.1800000000003
I mean

2447.24 --> 2453.24
England might have bigger problems than

2449.619 --> 2453.2400000000002
mine but is their [ __ ] problem

2455.14 --> 2459.1189999999997
we got our own problems right now

2462.49 --> 2465.68
[Music]

2467.92 --> 2475.6800000000003
[Music]

2471.82 --> 2475.6800000000003
selected Not Elected what

2477.4 --> 2482.26
foreign

2479.64 --> 2485.0789999999997
the new prime minister in England

2482.26 --> 2487.7200000000003
because Boris Johnson got kicked out

2485.079 --> 2490.42
right good riddance Jesus what a

2487.72 --> 2493.0789999999997
freaking piece of [ __ ]

2490.42 --> 2493.079
ugh

2522.119 --> 2526.42
right

2523.68 --> 2528.96
okay well I don't even know how those

2526.42 --> 2528.96
things work

2530.8 --> 2533.88
I have no idea

2540.46 --> 2546.579
I mean technically wouldn't the

2543.28 --> 2549.48
political party be the one actually

2546.579 --> 2549.48
choosing it

2549.64 --> 2554.16
right isn't that how it works a

2552.28 --> 2558.52
political party

2554.16 --> 2561.16
wins the election and then they have a

2558.52 --> 2562.599
right to basically assign somebody from

2561.16 --> 2566.16
their party

2562.599 --> 2566.1600000000003
isn't that how it works

2566.38 --> 2572.76
like everywhere

2568.839 --> 2572.7599999999998
except maybe in the United States

2573.4 --> 2579.4
where the prime ministers like really

2575.56 --> 2583.359
their own separate entity

2579.4 --> 2586.079
and then that's the one that's elected

2583.359 --> 2586.0789999999997
I don't know

2604.48 --> 2608.26
I mean if it's like somebody getting

2606.579 --> 2610.1800000000003
kicked out you gotta replace them

2608.26 --> 2612.6400000000003
quickly there's no time to like oh let's

2610.18 --> 2616.18
just not have a bar element for

2612.64 --> 2619.7799999999997
half a year and and then run again and

2616.18 --> 2622.1189999999997
like oh let's see who's the most popular

2619.78 --> 2624.099
to be friends yeah but you gotta replace

2622.119 --> 2626.1400000000003
him

2624.099 --> 2628.9
so

2626.14 --> 2630.94
I don't know

2628.9 --> 2633.2200000000003
but I have don't I know very little

2630.94 --> 2635.7400000000002
about this new prime minister

2633.22 --> 2639.16
I heard that she's

2635.74 --> 2641.9799999999996
not the solution at all so

2639.16 --> 2645.16
so far but I I literally don't even know

2641.98 --> 2646.839
like it's a she right or was it the I

2645.16 --> 2650.74
don't know I don't even know if it's he

2646.839 --> 2653.56
or she and I mean the actual he or she

2650.74 --> 2657.1189999999997
I don't know That's how little I know

2653.56 --> 2657.119
about the new prime minister in England

2662.02 --> 2665.22
what are you talking about

2678.28 --> 2683.52
what are you blabbering about Dorian

2681.28 --> 2683.52
Gray

2684.78 --> 2688.2000000000003
replacing the queen

2689.5 --> 2692.94
you mean succession

2699.51 --> 2702.679
[Music]

2718.54 --> 2720.839
foreign

2727.06 --> 2733.359
Yeah well yeah me

2730.48 --> 2737.92
I feel kind of the same I mean I still

2733.359 --> 2740.68
remember that when was it like 2004 or

2737.92 --> 2744.7000000000003
something back then

2740.68 --> 2749.5
like I voted for balkananda

2744.7 --> 2752.14
who seemed like a really smart nerd

2749.5 --> 2754.66
and then as soon as he got in he

2752.14 --> 2756.64
literally threw everything around

2754.66 --> 2760.66
everything

2756.64 --> 2764.14
like he switched instantly on absolutely

2760.66 --> 2766.66
everything total betrayal and that's the

2764.14 --> 2770.319
last time I'm ever voting

2766.66 --> 2773.74
for anybody that isn't established being

2770.319 --> 2777.4
attacked harassed and assaulted

2773.74 --> 2781.4799999999996
verbally or physically by Media or any

2777.4 --> 2784.1800000000003
of the other globalist cabal

2781.48 --> 2787.54
like if they're not all if they're not

2784.18 --> 2790.5
too deep in it to be able to switch I'm

2787.54 --> 2790.5
not even voting

2792.64 --> 2797.2599999999998
I'm not even voting like oh I don't know

2795.4 --> 2800.7400000000002
this man oh he talks a lot of says well

2797.26 --> 2805.78
guess what I I will guarantee you I will

2800.74 --> 2808.54
put bets of money out there that oh you

2805.78 --> 2810.94
don't really know him super well because

2808.54 --> 2814.119
he hasn't been continually in the news

2810.94 --> 2816.46
or specifically kept out or inFAMOUS for

2814.119 --> 2818.319
how much he's being assaulted by

2816.46 --> 2821.26
politics and media

2818.319 --> 2824.44
then I guarantee you I will guarantee

2821.26 --> 2827.8
you I will bet money that they will

2824.44 --> 2829.78
betray everything that they said as soon

2827.8 --> 2832.78
as you cast your vote

2829.78 --> 2832.78
guaranteed

2834.579 --> 2837.579
guaranteed

2838.9 --> 2843.76
and also I think that people that

2840.94 --> 2846.819
actually do that should officially get

2843.76 --> 2849.1600000000003
the death penalty for doing that yeah

2846.819 --> 2851.56
politician

2849.16 --> 2854.64
this should probably be Universal if a

2851.56 --> 2860.04
politician does a Marxist 180 degrees

2854.64 --> 2862.42
they should get the death penalty

2860.04 --> 2863.89
unconditional and

2862.42 --> 2865.96
unavailable

2863.89 --> 2869.02
[Music]

2865.96 --> 2871.0
just to make a point yeah if you make

2869.02 --> 2875.04
[ __ ] promises

2871.0 --> 2878.92
during your during your election yeah

2875.04 --> 2881.44
you must follow through

2878.92 --> 2885.4
or you die

2881.44 --> 2887.619
yeah oh you can't then you will pay for

2885.4 --> 2889.54
the damages that you can out of your own

2887.619 --> 2893.76
pocket

2889.54 --> 2898.02
to whatever extent possible

2893.76 --> 2902.1400000000003
that should be the default the default

2898.02 --> 2903.579
universal default for anybody going in

2902.14 --> 2906.9
government

2903.579 --> 2906.9
doing elections

2912.76 --> 2920.5600000000004
because that [ __ ] the ability for a

2917.5 --> 2923.56
politician to just be able to lie about

2920.56 --> 2927.4
everything get elected and then

2923.56 --> 2929.92
literally rape everybody

2927.4 --> 2933.76
that is literally the thing that has

2929.92 --> 2935.319
destroyed politics universally it has

2933.76 --> 2938.38
destroyed

2935.319 --> 2939.819
what was originally just a form of

2938.38 --> 2942.94
diplomacy

2939.819 --> 2945.099
they destroyed it by allowing that to be

2942.94 --> 2948.64
able to be possible

2945.099 --> 2951.52
it should be Universal rule that if a

2948.64 --> 2954.52
politician for a political function

2951.52 --> 2958.359
campaigns

2954.52 --> 2961.599
and then when he is elected if he goes a

2958.359 --> 2965.319
180 degrees on anything in there

2961.599 --> 2970.619
anything for any reason even War

2965.319 --> 2970.619
then they get the death penalty

2970.839 --> 2980.5
yeah so don't run on something you know

2977.14 --> 2981.5789999999997
you're not gonna do just to get a little

2980.5 --> 2985.56
popular

2981.579 --> 2985.5600000000004
yeah you piece of [ __ ]

2985.599 --> 2988.98
that's my rule

2995.16 --> 3003.0789999999997
[Music]

3000.48 --> 3003.079
foreign

3004.16 --> 3011.819
subtleties no maneuvering no oh they're

3008.22 --> 3013.6189999999997
just trying to play for the chest no oh

3011.819 --> 3016.38
no no no no no no

3013.619 --> 3019.92
if they turn around 180 degrees on

3016.38 --> 3025.46
anything about their election promises

3019.92 --> 3029.64
then they should get the death penalty

3025.46 --> 3030.599
yeah oh it's a radical yeah guess what

3029.64 --> 3034.02
though

3030.599 --> 3037.2000000000003
guess what if you do that that shit's

3034.02 --> 3040.74
not gonna happen anymore yeah you won't

3037.2 --> 3043.02
get any more delusional story roll out

3040.74 --> 3046.3999999999996
from politics to make everybody

3043.02 --> 3049.5
oh believe in Hope and change

3046.4 --> 3053.339
yeah that's gonna stop then the [ __ ]

3049.5 --> 3055.94
hysterical clown show for the Sheep will

3053.339 --> 3055.94
then stop

3056.359 --> 3065.22
if they get the death penalty

3061.079 --> 3068.2400000000002
for going 180 degrees on any of their

3065.22 --> 3068.24
election promises

3069.48 --> 3076.88
guess what

3070.98 --> 3076.88
guess what over no more Marxism

3077.28 --> 3082.8590000000004
because if anybody tries they get

3080.099 --> 3085.44
executed

3082.859 --> 3088.38
everybody to see

3085.44 --> 3092.4
that's my solution that's what I would

3088.38 --> 3094.8
do if I got the power somehow and I

3092.4 --> 3098.7000000000003
would do that I would do it

3094.8 --> 3101.52
I would etch it in Granite

3098.7 --> 3102.7799999999997
and have it installed

3101.52 --> 3106.74
like

3102.78 --> 3108.6600000000003
right like as a front tile

3106.74 --> 3110.819
on the government yeah before the

3108.66 --> 3112.64
government building entry that's where I

3110.819 --> 3114.119
do that

3112.64 --> 3118.0789999999997
[Music]

3114.119 --> 3120.0
yeah to remind everybody yeah you make

3118.079 --> 3121.7400000000002
election promises

3120.0 --> 3126.42
that you then

3121.74 --> 3129.14
do 180 degrees on you get the death

3126.42 --> 3129.14
penalty

3129.66 --> 3136.319
so be very [ __ ] careful what you're

3133.38 --> 3138.9
gonna promise yeah no more false

3136.319 --> 3141.7799999999997
promises because now there would be a

3138.9 --> 3144.0
price a big [ __ ] price

3141.78 --> 3146.52
you're gonna risk that huh

3144.0 --> 3148.98
scumbags you're gonna risk that your

3146.52 --> 3151.64
political infiltrators your Marxist

3148.98 --> 3151.64
traitors

3152.76 --> 3158.3590000000004
there's my solution

3155.77 --> 3160.92
[Music]

3158.359 --> 3164.96
politicians are not going to avoid to be

3160.92 --> 3164.96
killed no they don't need to vote

3167.52 --> 3173.22
you think I'm gonna

3169.2 --> 3176.9399999999996
that such a thing would be voted in no

3173.22 --> 3180.24
no no it would be a rule that cannot be

3176.94 --> 3186.48
voted in or voted out it's just gonna be

3180.24 --> 3186.4799999999996
law it's going to be constitutional law

3186.54 --> 3194.54
yeah that's where I would put that

3189.24 --> 3194.54
would supplement it in the Constitution

3196.2 --> 3201.3289999999997
[Music]

3203.79 --> 3213.749
[Music]

3214.319 --> 3219.72
all right so think about it I mean yeah

3217.319 --> 3221.339
you're right like no politician out

3219.72 --> 3223.5589999999997
there is going to do it I mean all of

3221.339 --> 3225.9
them are literally [ __ ] in their

3223.559 --> 3228.119
pants at the notion of this

3225.9 --> 3231.119
but they're probably all very confident

3228.119 --> 3234.48
that's never going to happen we can keep

3231.119 --> 3237.059
lying for another 100 years and we'll

3234.48 --> 3241.26
just take everything of everybody

3237.059 --> 3242.52
yeah until a series revolved and then

3241.26 --> 3245.76
you know

3242.52 --> 3249.54
ads cut off and

3245.76 --> 3251.4
to be found on spiked fences especially

3249.54 --> 3252.9
surrounding government buildings and all

3251.4 --> 3255.599
that and

3252.9 --> 3257.52
yeah and then well at some point

3255.599 --> 3260.04
somebody's got to try again well guess

3257.52 --> 3262.14
what oh yeah and now it's going to be

3260.04 --> 3266.94
very easy

3262.14 --> 3270.24
to maneuver such a measuring yeah

3266.94 --> 3272.7000000000003
a constitutional alteration politicians

3270.24 --> 3276.2999999999997
cannot make election promises

3272.7 --> 3277.7999999999997
that they then break under penalty of

3276.3 --> 3279.96
death

3277.8 --> 3282.78
so you better [ __ ] make sure you're

3279.96 --> 3284.96
gonna deliver the promises when you make

3282.78 --> 3284.96
them

3287.099 --> 3296.8
or you don't make them

3288.62 --> 3296.7999999999997
[Music]

3302.94 --> 3309.359
right but but you're right I mean

3305.88 --> 3312.839
a serious revolt

3309.359 --> 3315.119
and mass execution of politicians would

3312.839 --> 3316.91
probably need to precede any such

3315.119 --> 3320.929
measure

3316.91 --> 3320.9289999999996
[Music]

3323.33 --> 3326.61
[Music]

3337.04 --> 3341.52
right

3338.839 --> 3343.319
now they'll give you something to chew

3341.52 --> 3346.859
about

3343.319 --> 3350.52
stop being so scared

3346.859 --> 3353.819
don't be scared be aggressive

3350.52 --> 3355.559
do you notice when if you see me scared

3353.819 --> 3358.2599999999998
about any of this

3355.559 --> 3360.5400000000004
when am I scared when am I

3358.26 --> 3362.0400000000004
resonating panic

3360.54 --> 3364.38
I don't

3362.04 --> 3367.319
I get aggressive

3364.38 --> 3370.079
and I get aggressive not wildly and

3367.319 --> 3372.359
undirected but directed and planned and

3370.079 --> 3374.1600000000003
structural because I've integrated it

3372.359 --> 3376.74
with me

3374.16 --> 3378.7799999999997
with my total being

3376.74 --> 3380.4599999999996
so when it comes out it comes out

3378.78 --> 3384.26
structurally

3380.46 --> 3384.26
and it comes out with a purpose

3384.9 --> 3390.86
with cohesion on another level

3387.64 --> 3390.8599999999997
[Music]

3396.119 --> 3404.46
yeah no fear no Panic ever it's better

3401.579 --> 3407.15
to literally kill yourself than to

3404.46 --> 3408.78
surrender your soul to panic

3407.15 --> 3412.14
[Music]

3408.78 --> 3413.7000000000003
I mean you can get startled right you

3412.14 --> 3417.0
can be like oh [ __ ] what's happening

3413.7 --> 3420.18
that's that's just in the moment in like

3417.0 --> 3422.76
a visceral response I mean if suddenly

3420.18 --> 3424.319
something appears in a place where you

3422.76 --> 3426.7200000000003
totally didn't expect it yeah you'll

3424.319 --> 3430.02
start all the [ __ ] out of yourself

3426.72 --> 3431.4599999999996
that's not the same as panicking because

3430.02 --> 3433.619
panicking

3431.46 --> 3437.339
is really

3433.619 --> 3440.52
where that startle that frequency takes

3437.339 --> 3442.92
you over and you give up you let that

3440.52 --> 3445.859
happen that's panic

3442.92 --> 3447.66
its weakness Panic is weakness and you

3445.859 --> 3451.02
should never give in to that

3447.66 --> 3454.68
there's a better way to deal with it

3451.02 --> 3457.859
and that is to ins yeah if you're gonna

3454.68 --> 3459.2999999999997
be forced by anything in that frequency

3457.859 --> 3461.2799999999997
then why don't you do something

3459.3 --> 3463.8
productive with that frequency and the

3461.28 --> 3465.96
only way that I know to do anything with

3463.8 --> 3470.48
it at all that could remotely be

3465.96 --> 3470.48
productive is through anger

3471.9 --> 3475.52
and a righteous Focus

3476.04 --> 3480.8
so yeah PJ cruising righteous anger

3481.079 --> 3487.04
righteous anger is a thousandfold better

3483.96 --> 3487.04
than panic

3488.7 --> 3492.2599999999998
on the long run as well

3492.48 --> 3497.22
yeah

3493.68 --> 3499.44
because somebody with righteous anger in

3497.22 --> 3502.02
the minds and hearts of people

3499.44 --> 3505.02
are a lot more reliable than somebody

3502.02 --> 3510.359
who completely panics and loses it yeah

3505.02 --> 3513.72
in a giant variety of ways

3510.359 --> 3517.14
so this is pragmatic as well

3513.72 --> 3519.18
much much better to be angry and be seen

3517.14 --> 3522.1189999999997
as angry and maybe a little out of

3519.18 --> 3523.5
control angry than to be seen as

3522.119 --> 3526.98
somebody

3523.5 --> 3531.0
panicking or little panicking

3526.98 --> 3533.64
or panicking out of control

3531.0 --> 3535.5
you just put those two responses right

3533.64 --> 3537.839
next to another and you be honest about

3535.5 --> 3540.66
it like oh what if I saw somebody that

3537.839 --> 3543.18
had that or that

3540.66 --> 3544.2599999999998
over time how would you feel about them

3543.18 --> 3546.66
yeah

3544.26 --> 3549.0
let's get honest here

3546.66 --> 3551.7
somebody that gets pissed off

3549.0 --> 3553.4
is a lot more useful than somebody that

3551.7 --> 3559.9489999999996
panics

3553.4 --> 3559.949
[Music]

3562.319 --> 3566.239
right

3563.06 --> 3566.239
[Music]

3567.299 --> 3573.18
I hate panic and I hated in people I

3570.78 --> 3577.02
hate it in Grapplers I hated in Trolls

3573.18 --> 3580.5589999999997
but I also hate it when it is in people

3577.02 --> 3584.16
that I know are better than that

3580.559 --> 3587.299
and when I detect it I get agitated

3584.16 --> 3587.299
and I get pushy

3588.119 --> 3594.42
so make sure you clean yourself of panic

3592.02 --> 3596.04
you clean that off before you get in

3594.42 --> 3598.2000000000003
here

3596.04 --> 3600.619
because if you still got it you're gonna

3598.2 --> 3600.6189999999997
get it

3602.52 --> 3608.04
don't be a victim Don't Be Afraid don't

3605.819 --> 3610.88
panic

3608.04 --> 3610.88
foreign

3612.74 --> 3617.7
and just because you can't be a victim

3615.42 --> 3619.619
in spirit doesn't mean that you can't

3617.7 --> 3622.0789999999997
have

3619.619 --> 3623.339
bad things happen to you that you just

3622.079 --> 3625.92
need to share

3623.339 --> 3628.44
that you need like to be honest about or

3625.92 --> 3630.359
something that's completely different

3628.44 --> 3633.299
if you're just having a really shitty

3630.359 --> 3634.38
day or something terrible has just

3633.299 --> 3636.42
happened

3634.38 --> 3639.0
then you can absolutely be emotional

3636.42 --> 3642.54
about that but

3639.0 --> 3644.64
under the long-term condition that you

3642.54 --> 3647.16
get over it

3644.64 --> 3649.799
that's very important because if you

3647.16 --> 3651.0
hang on you become a victim victim

3649.799 --> 3652.619
tactician

3651.0 --> 3656.52
and that's

3652.619 --> 3660.319
very very bad for you

3656.52 --> 3660.319
and for everybody that knows you

3663.18 --> 3666.02
anyways

3676.2 --> 3681.1189999999997
prior planning and preparation prevents

3678.78 --> 3683.2200000000003
poor performance

3681.119 --> 3686.819
I guess

3683.22 --> 3688.4399999999996
if you have that in you I improvise my

3686.819 --> 3691.079
[ __ ]

3688.44 --> 3693.2400000000002
but I also build energy

3691.079 --> 3696.299
for that

3693.24 --> 3702.1189999999997
yeah so I don't spend my time memorizing

3696.299 --> 3705.5
things or gathering material on paper or

3702.119 --> 3705.5
or digital

3706.02 --> 3714.0
I collect energy and I'm always busy

3710.7 --> 3717.24
dream walking thinking doing that thing

3714.0 --> 3719.66
which is hyper ethereal

3717.24 --> 3722.64
and that is basically the foundation

3719.66 --> 3723.7799999999997
that makes it able for me to keep doing

3722.64 --> 3726.0
this

3723.78 --> 3727.98
because I tap into that when I do this

3726.0 --> 3731.04
show and when I think

3727.98 --> 3734.16
in general because my attitude on the

3731.04 --> 3737.099
show is much getting very close to who

3734.16 --> 3740.0989999999997
are who I am and who I am is actually

3737.099 --> 3741.6800000000003
migrating towards the attitude that I've

3740.099 --> 3744.6600000000003
created in my

3741.68 --> 3749.48
displayed identity

3744.66 --> 3752.22
on the screen so yes I am actually

3749.48 --> 3754.26
growing towards being more like this

3752.22 --> 3755.64
like how I am on the internet in the

3754.26 --> 3758.3390000000004
real world

3755.64 --> 3760.799
which is kind of worrisome but I think

3758.339 --> 3762.96
it's also just necessary because I

3760.799 --> 3763.92
cannot be that person that I've always

3762.96 --> 3766.44
been

3763.92 --> 3767.579
that is just hyper silent and kind of

3766.44 --> 3770.88
always just

3767.579 --> 3773.2200000000003
standing there and like trying to be

3770.88 --> 3775.02
emotionally supportive in a non-verbal

3773.22 --> 3778.02
way

3775.02 --> 3781.619
not overly overdoing it like a gay or

3778.02 --> 3783.9
anything or a woman but just to be

3781.619 --> 3785.6400000000003
yeah there and not really all that

3783.9 --> 3787.859
talkative because that's how I've been

3785.64 --> 3789.96
mostly until something gets Technical

3787.859 --> 3792.7799999999997
and then I immediately jump in and just

3789.96 --> 3795.299
explain the technicals

3792.78 --> 3796.7400000000002
but I'm just getting more forward like

3795.299 --> 3800.66
this

3796.74 --> 3800.66
more forward about these opinions

3801.839 --> 3807.18
and about my views on how things should

3804.599 --> 3810.0
be run and what's really happening I'm

3807.18 --> 3812.0989999999997
digging more into it as I am on the show

3810.0 --> 3813.119
with you guys I'm also doing that out

3812.099 --> 3816.3590000000004
there

3813.119 --> 3819.78
I just haven't really

3816.359 --> 3821.5789999999997
connected up that far but I know that's

3819.78 --> 3824.48
what's going to roll out because that's

3821.579 --> 3824.48
what I'm becoming

3830.28 --> 3835.9100000000003
but yeah Dorian Gray you're

3832.859 --> 3837.42
statement is pretty universally true

3835.91 --> 3840.799
[Music]

3837.42 --> 3840.799
right wow

3843.059 --> 3848.5400000000004
that first hour

3845.16 --> 3848.54
slip by quick

3852.48 --> 3858.619
are you guys enjoying the show

3855.059 --> 3858.619
am I making sense to you

3862.2 --> 3866.64
I mean if I at some point don't make

3864.299 --> 3868.5
sense then don't wait five minutes to

3866.64 --> 3869.839
try to figure out what I was saying just

3868.5 --> 3872.4
ask

3869.839 --> 3874.74
like if you don't get it in the moment

3872.4 --> 3877.799
don't be afraid to ask it's not stupid

3874.74 --> 3880.74
like even if right after you typed it a

3877.799 --> 3883.02
second later you already figure it out

3880.74 --> 3885.0589999999997
because it's just a good question to ask

3883.02 --> 3887.16
right it's

3885.059 --> 3889.799
it's Socratic

3887.16 --> 3892.6189999999997
and Socratic action is always good

3889.799 --> 3895.68
asking a question even if when you're

3892.619 --> 3897.7200000000003
typing it out you immediately realize

3895.68 --> 3899.819
the answer then it's still a good

3897.72 --> 3901.5
question to ask even if you already know

3899.819 --> 3904.04
the answer because it's a good question

3901.5 --> 3904.04
to ask

3904.62 --> 3910.14
[Music]

3907.2 --> 3912.359
yeah sometimes you need to just ask a

3910.14 --> 3914.8799999999997
question that you know the answer to to

3912.359 --> 3917.02
make somebody else realize that it's a

3914.88 --> 3919.2000000000003
good question

3917.02 --> 3921.02
[Music]

3919.2 --> 3926.22
that they might answer

3921.02 --> 3929.42
[Music]

3926.22 --> 3929.4199999999996
okay glad I'm making sense

3943.68 --> 3946.89
[Music]

3949.14 --> 3955.64
I'm wondering what I'm gonna title this

3951.24 --> 3957.9599999999996
show I kind of want to title it

3955.64 --> 3960.7799999999997
politicians that violate election

3957.96 --> 3963.059
promises

3960.78 --> 3964.0
should get the death penalty but I think

3963.059 --> 3965.3390000000004
that

3964.0 --> 3968.22
[Music]

3965.339 --> 3972.96
I don't know I might like the word death

3968.22 --> 3975.8999999999996
in general is like really scary

3972.96 --> 3978.78
like even in the Netherlands

3975.9 --> 3982.619
like alternative news forums they just

3978.78 --> 3985.02
delete comments like that if I get like

3982.619 --> 3987.1800000000003
they need the death penalty if I just

3985.02 --> 3989.18
say these people need the death penalty

3987.18 --> 3992.16
they delete that message

3989.18 --> 3994.799
[Music]

3992.16 --> 3995.8799999999997
I mean is that such an outrageous

3994.799 --> 3998.339
statement

3995.88 --> 4000.38
the call for somebody's death that has

3998.339 --> 4003.2599999999998
literally been

4000.38 --> 4006.92
the organizer

4003.26 --> 4009.6800000000003
of a situation that is have has created

4006.92 --> 4012.619
like thousands and thousands of dead

4009.68 --> 4014.4199999999996
people in my nation that literally

4012.619 --> 4016.28
trusted it

4014.42 --> 4019.46
because of their trust they're they're

4016.28 --> 4021.3190000000004
dead or seriously ill and never will

4019.46 --> 4023.9
recover

4021.319 --> 4026.48
and then I should not call for the death

4023.9 --> 4028.4
penalty of that individual

4026.48 --> 4030.619
what

4028.4 --> 4033.14
why not

4030.619 --> 4035.359
are you afraid of what will happen to

4033.14 --> 4036.98
the general public or the fellow sheep

4035.359 --> 4038.5389999999998
that are already pissed off when they

4036.98 --> 4040.88
start seeing those statements are you

4038.539 --> 4043.46
afraid they're gonna also start to have

4040.88 --> 4045.079
that idea then

4043.46 --> 4046.2200000000003
afraid that

4045.079 --> 4048.5
like

4046.22 --> 4051.5
my spark might be a little bit too

4048.5 --> 4053.93
bright might cause the the fuel to catch

4051.5 --> 4057.15
Flame

4053.93 --> 4057.1499999999996
[Music]

4063.98 --> 4069.079
but I do I I really do I I'm at the

4067.339 --> 4072.5589999999997
point where I want to actually have

4069.079 --> 4075.38
Billboards that say

4072.559 --> 4079.52
death penalty for politicians

4075.38 --> 4082.6400000000003
I want that to be a thing I want

4079.52 --> 4084.46
everyone to see that I want them to

4082.64 --> 4090.22
realize

4084.46 --> 4090.2200000000003
politicians should get death penalties

4090.38 --> 4096.56
it's not just for Hitler yeah it's for

4093.799 --> 4099.199
politicians the ones that lie and break

4096.56 --> 4101.96
their promises brutally

4099.199 --> 4103.4
the ones that actually effectively get

horseshit

4132.62 --> 4139.099999999999
yeah

4134.9 --> 4140.12
we need death penalty for politicians

4139.1 --> 4143.359
back

4140.12 --> 4145.759
they've been hyper over protected and

4143.359 --> 4146.900000000001
now look at where we [ __ ] are because

4145.759 --> 4149.42
of it

4146.9 --> 4153.92
it needs to stop

4149.42 --> 4157.46
we need to turn it around

4153.92 --> 4161.12
death penalty for politicians need to

4157.46 --> 4163.339
come back and I want everybody to get it

4161.12 --> 4166.04
in their minds

4163.339 --> 4169.759
this is what they fear this is what

4166.04 --> 4172.759
those head puppets dancing on the sharp

4169.759 --> 4175.219
end of a sword are fearing

4172.759 --> 4177.5
this is what they put a lot of power in

4175.219 --> 4180.859
in trying to prevent that from happening

4177.5 --> 4184.219
we need to make it happen we need to

4180.859 --> 4187.900000000001
take them by the legs and rip them right

4184.219 --> 4191.96
over that sharp end of the sword

4187.9 --> 4195.259999999999
rip him right over it Bang

4191.96 --> 4197.719
now you got two half politicians now

4195.26 --> 4199.900000000001
which is more productive than a whole

4197.719 --> 4199.9

if I just say bring back death penalty

4285.62 --> 4291.14
for politicians that's

4287.6 --> 4292.64
that's like too undirected because I

4291.14 --> 4294.9800000000005
want it to be very specific I'm not

4292.64 --> 4297.9800000000005
saying like who kill all politicians no

4294.98 --> 4299.659
it has to be very conditional

4297.98 --> 4302.419999999999
right

4299.659 --> 4305.659
it's very simple

4302.42 --> 4309.679
you make election promises then you must

4305.659 --> 4312.5599999999995
fulfill them under any circumstances

4309.679 --> 4315.62
under any circumstances

4312.56 --> 4319.1
unless there is like a I don't know a

4315.62 --> 4322.64
universal vote like oh [ __ ]

4319.1 --> 4326.780000000001
like Siri like our borders are now being

4322.64 --> 4329.54
overrun by military Invasion Force we

4326.78 --> 4332.9
might not be able to

4329.54 --> 4337.82
no get the new school books

4332.9 --> 4340.46
updated right I mean yeah

4337.82 --> 4342.259999999999
there has to be some logical dynamic in

4340.46 --> 4345.08
there but

4342.26 --> 4349.219
there has to be

4345.08 --> 4352.88
a weight a potentially lethal weight on

4349.219 --> 4356.0
Election promises it has to be

4352.88 --> 4357.679
right it's either that or forbid it

4356.0 --> 4360.8
forbid

4357.679 --> 4365.0
election campaigning universally it's

4360.8 --> 4367.9400000000005
either one but this ability to just be

4365.0 --> 4372.52
able to lie about everything

4367.94 --> 4375.32
until you get voted in it has to stop

4372.52 --> 4376.9400000000005
it has to stop

4375.32 --> 4379.04
everywhere

4376.94 --> 4382.48
it's a disaster

what I'm I'm bringing up

4442.04 --> 4448.28
like an actual solution for politics and

immediately you're just ah kill the

4455.179 --> 4459.04
yeah they're not politicians

4459.739 --> 4463.0599999999995
there's nothing to do with it

4495.159 --> 4501.08
no it's not political correctness it has

4498.5 --> 4504.8
nothing to do with anything political

4501.08 --> 4507.8
only thing has to do with is election

4504.8 --> 4507.8
promises

4507.86 --> 4514.219
simple

4510.02 --> 4516.26
election promises should be reclassified

4514.219 --> 4518.54
like the approach of it

4516.26 --> 4521.6
should be reclassified should rather be

4518.54 --> 4523.46
approached as a business plan yeah

4521.6 --> 4526.159000000001
I know I happen to know this I've never

4523.46 --> 4528.14
actually done my know how this works

4526.159 --> 4531.259999999999
I have a business plan

4528.14 --> 4533.0
go to the bank a lot of the times or

4531.26 --> 4535.280000000001
you'll have money whatever if you're

4533.0 --> 4536.659
lucky or a rich dad or something but

4535.28 --> 4538.46
yeah a lot of people that go into

4536.659 --> 4540.86
business they go to the bank they have a

4538.46 --> 4542.2390000000005
business plan then the bank says okay we

4540.86 --> 4546.5599999999995
think that business plan is going to

4542.239 --> 4550.639999999999
work out here is your money for it

4546.56 --> 4553.580000000001
yeah well if you then

4550.64 --> 4556.1
just don't do anything with the business

4553.58 --> 4559.84
plan and you just take the money and run

4556.1 --> 4559.84
or something well guess what

4560.659 --> 4565.639999999999
there's gonna be consequences

4563.48 --> 4567.199
and the same

4565.64 --> 4570.7390000000005
should work

4567.199 --> 4573.379999999999
for election promises election promises

4570.739 --> 4577.459999999999
should be like a business plan when you

4573.38 --> 4580.64
put it there you have to do it

4577.46 --> 4583.46
or there will be direct consequences

4580.64 --> 4587.54
that is what I think should happen

4583.46 --> 4589.88
yeah it should not be a free-for-all

4587.54 --> 4593.12
just an indoctrination Fest it's like

4589.88 --> 4596.659000000001
who can make the most outrageous

4593.12 --> 4598.699
with the times promises in order to

4596.659 --> 4602.739
delude everybody to get on their side

4653.84 --> 4658.159000000001
make such determinations

4656.36 --> 4661.0599999999995
you don't even know what you're going to

4658.159 --> 4661.0599999999995
be like in 20 years

4664.219 --> 4668.6
maybe you should like

4666.199 --> 4670.82
get a bit of a grip on the Bravada there

4668.6 --> 4673.1
yeah you're young you're passionate but

4670.82 --> 4677.0599999999995
you're young

4673.1 --> 4680.860000000001
you should realize that no

4677.06 --> 4680.860000000001
you can't make those statements

4683.719 --> 4690.38
I mean if you'd say that about Professor

4686.239 --> 4692.0599999999995
Phil Bell I'd get it because he's shoved

4690.38 --> 4693.8
it in everybody's face with Orinoco

4692.06 --> 4698.02
Wombo here is not

4693.8 --> 4698.02
is not like professor philbel

4705.44 --> 4709.839999999999
I've said plenty of times no I haven't

4714.02 --> 4720.26

4720.26 --> 4724.9400000000005
get it right now

4722.78 --> 4726.8
you're not getting it yeah but that's

4724.94 --> 4729.678999999999
not the same as saying you're never

4726.8 --> 4733.1
going to develop the correct mindset

4729.679 --> 4734.84
like how the hell do you know

4733.1 --> 4737.4800000000005
all you know is that they're not doing

4734.84 --> 4739.219
it right now you think that's what you

4737.48 --> 4741.799999999999
feel out that's why you said it that

4739.219 --> 4744.94
doesn't mean that you then know that

4741.8 --> 4744.9400000000005
they're never gonna do that

Ari NOCO is too basic

he is not

4757.4 --> 4761.78
what the hell turret

4759.62 --> 4763.94
you're talking to a guy that practically

4761.78 --> 4768.199
studied classical music and you're

4763.94 --> 4768.199

4784.78 --> 4791.0599999999995

4787.96 --> 4794.12
unfortunately slightly projecting here

4791.06 --> 4796.580000000001
because it's just not true

4794.12 --> 4798.86
I mean I really like Orinoco one well

4796.58 --> 4801.46
the only thing really that I don't like

4798.86 --> 4804.139999999999
about him is that he's still a baller

4801.46 --> 4806.78
but beside that

4804.14 --> 4809.360000000001
I really do like it and he's had a lot

4806.78 --> 4812.3
of great insights that he shared so

4809.36 --> 4815.36
yeah I don't know what you're doing here

4812.3 --> 4818.1990000000005

hey Kitty

4824.239 --> 4828.199

that's already saying something

4828.199 --> 4832.28
okay

4829.699 --> 4835.419999999999
don't give every baller that likes to

4870.8 --> 4873.52
right

4873.8 --> 4880.1
so just take it easy

4876.92 --> 4882.679
right let's not attack those of our

4880.1 --> 4884.84
philosophical opposition when we got an

4882.679 --> 4888.8
entire guild

4884.84 --> 4892.04
of insane evil demonic politicians that

4888.8 --> 4893.900000000001
are literally planning to get everybody

4892.04 --> 4897.82

4893.9 --> 4897.82
maybe there would be a better Target

4903.32 --> 4907.0
oh come on Lennox

4907.94 --> 4913.04
you know that doesn't work

4910.34 --> 4916.360000000001
nobody hates themselves for being a

4913.04 --> 4916.36

4918.14 --> 4925.64
I didn't hate myself for being a baller

4922.64 --> 4928.780000000001
and when I do ball win I don't hate

4925.64 --> 4928.780000000001
believing in the ball

4929.6 --> 4932.92
so it's just not true

4936.26 --> 4940.46
well you should yeah but I mean yeah but

4939.38 --> 4942.7390000000005
you don't

4940.46 --> 4944.78
Ballers don't hate themselves for being

4942.739 --> 4946.4
a baller they might hate themselves for

4944.78 --> 4948.679
a variety of different reasons but not

4946.4 --> 4951.0199999999995
for the ball I mean to them the ball is

4948.679 --> 4954.62
like the one redeeming thing

4951.02 --> 4957.34
the one thing that keeps it all together

4954.62 --> 4957.34
so

4963.1 --> 4967.4800000000005
that's racist what

4969.199 --> 4972.678999999999
Indian blood

4971.0 --> 4976.159
I'm sorry

4972.679 --> 4979.4800000000005

4976.159 --> 4979.48
this is what

4996.56 --> 5000.88
maybe I should have been more spit

4998.3 --> 5003.6
province is specific or something

5000.88 --> 5003.6
hmm

5010.719 --> 5016.179
India never attacked any country except

5013.659 --> 5017.62
Pakistan

5016.179 --> 5020.38
and

5017.62 --> 5022.78
arguably China

5020.38 --> 5024.400000000001
I mean come on

5022.78 --> 5027.099999999999
India

5024.4 --> 5030.82
is not like a big war country that

5027.1 --> 5033.04
overruns other regions but it's not

5030.82 --> 5037.139999999999

ah

reason nobody has a wrench without me

5106.54 --> 5111.719
like having consciously given it to them

5109.06 --> 5111.719
so

5112.6 --> 5115.14
anyway

5116.679 --> 5121.179
oh

5117.96 --> 5124.3
ha I called it

5121.179 --> 5127.659
I knew it was gonna clear up some

5124.3 --> 5131.9400000000005
still being trilled though but

5127.659 --> 5131.94
yeah looks a lot better right guys

5146.739 --> 5149.739
nice

5166.12 --> 5168.12
um

5169.48 --> 5175.959999999999
oh yeah I got another bonus package for

5172.179 --> 5180.54
my organic Supermarket the Eco Plaza I

5175.96 --> 5180.54
mean I really like that store so

5181.32 --> 5186.4
I'm gonna keep doing that every year and

5184.42 --> 5188.56
they just

5186.4 --> 5190.9
collect stickers and then you get a box

5188.56 --> 5194.56
of goodies but yeah mostly it's goodies

5190.9 --> 5197.138999999999
that are not like my typical things that

5194.56 --> 5200.26
I get there's always something

5197.139 --> 5202.179
interesting in there like chocolate it's

5200.26 --> 5205.06
like the only time I even eat chocolate

5202.179 --> 5208.9800000000005
is mostly because of these boxes because

5205.06 --> 5208.9800000000005
I don't actually buy chocolate anymore

5209.99 --> 5215.44
[Music]

5211.36 --> 5217.0
right but it does make like a good gift

5215.44 --> 5218.678999999999
package you know if there's something in

5217.0 --> 5221.38
there that I don't particularly like

5218.679 --> 5223.679
well I can give it away it's all organic

5221.38 --> 5223.679
so

5225.34 --> 5229.32
and it's like a good opportunity

5236.92 --> 5241.78
to even make all these nice printed

5239.28 --> 5244.78
things for it please

5241.78 --> 5244.78
woohoo

5253.56 --> 5256.749000000001
[Music]

5257.94 --> 5264.719
there are people here who called the

5260.56 --> 5264.719
Pakistan in India attacks fake

5268.179 --> 5274.32
well

5269.8 --> 5274.320000000001
Terry look it might be

5274.84 --> 5281.9800000000005
the government sowing it

5277.84 --> 5284.8
right I mean conflict has

5281.98 --> 5286.419999999999
traditionally for about most of History

5284.8 --> 5289.96
been a

5286.42 --> 5292.2390000000005
a factor that binds people together the

5289.96 --> 5293.9800000000005
spirit of a people so yeah it might be

5292.239 --> 5296.638999999999
government that's literally just

5293.98 --> 5296.638999999999
attacking

5297.1 --> 5303.820000000001
like getting some thugs to do that just

5300.699 --> 5306.419999999999
to get that riled up spirit and and

5303.82 --> 5312.48
maybe like

5306.42 --> 5312.4800000000005
take something back or something right

5314.8 --> 5321.400000000001
so yeah in a sense they might not be

5318.28 --> 5322.719
naturally spawned

5321.4 --> 5325.599999999999
right

5322.719 --> 5328.84
the government might simply trigger

5325.6 --> 5332.679
it so that the people then get oh what

5328.84 --> 5335.56
this [ __ ] again get him

5332.679 --> 5339.46
I mean if it works it works so maybe

5335.56 --> 5342.639
they're right when they say that damn it

5339.46 --> 5345.52
people that think that it's it's faked

5342.639 --> 5349.38
it could be I would not be surprised I

5345.52 --> 5349.38
mean that's pretty standard these days

5353.639 --> 5361.54
surgical strikes were CGI what

5358.54 --> 5364.42
going RV

5361.54 --> 5366.639
well you're just relaying what you've

5364.42 --> 5369.9
heard from your fellow

5366.639 --> 5369.900000000001
Indians so

5380.34 --> 5383.4400000000005
interesting I don't know I haven't seen

5382.6 --> 5386.1990000000005
it

5383.44 --> 5389.138999999999
if you share the video with me

5386.199 --> 5390.46
then I can use my intuition and my

5389.139 --> 5393.82
knowledge

5390.46 --> 5396.88
my yeah Reflections from the past

5393.82 --> 5398.92
to see if there's anything to that if it

5396.88 --> 5401.5
was actually faked I mean

5398.92 --> 5403.719
that [ __ ] happens

5401.5 --> 5406.78
just look at what's what's come out of

5403.719 --> 5411.06
Ukraine in like the last decade

5406.78 --> 5411.0599999999995
they faked a lot of [ __ ]

5411.46 --> 5416.44
and they've even been caught basically

5413.5 --> 5418.239
using computer game Graphics to suggest

5416.44 --> 5421.299999999999
that something really happened in [ __ ]

5418.239 --> 5424.48
so maybe Pakistan is kind of doing that

5421.3 --> 5426.58
or India and Pakistan whoever maybe

5424.48 --> 5430.659
they're doing things like that too

5426.58 --> 5434.639
I mean CGI fakery is a lot cheaper than

5430.659 --> 5434.638999999999
actual military hostilities

5434.92 --> 5437.46
you know

5451.78 --> 5458.62
they made a Bollywood movie what

5455.36 --> 5461.28
[Music]

5458.62 --> 5461.28
okay

5468.04 --> 5470.159
thank you

5483.159 --> 5486.54
interesting Derek

5487.42 --> 5493.42
I'd be pretty interested in in seeing

5490.78 --> 5495.159
like a more elaborate conversation and

5493.42 --> 5498.34
discussion about that

5495.159 --> 5500.679
whether that was fake or not

5498.34 --> 5503.02
but you would have to well

5500.679 --> 5505.4800000000005
it would have to be mostly Indian since

5503.02 --> 5508.120000000001
yeah they were bare and they were

5505.48 --> 5510.218999999999
submerged in all that stuff

5508.12 --> 5511.9
I have not I mean this is literally the

5510.219 --> 5514.42
first time I'm hearing of that that even

5511.9 --> 5517.239
happened I mean I might have gotten like

5514.42 --> 5518.7390000000005
a footnote in the news but that would

5517.239 --> 5521.699
have been like two seconds and then

5518.739 --> 5521.699
moved on so

5523.06 --> 5527.92
I don't know a lot about it

5525.34 --> 5530.62
it does sound interesting though

5527.92 --> 5533.159
if it if it could have been fake

5530.62 --> 5533.159
anyway

5533.199 --> 5537.299999999999
I'm getting close to the end of the show

5540.699 --> 5545.58
hey dank good to see you

5542.92 --> 5545.58
how are you doing

5567.88 --> 5573.42
doing great okay awesome I'm always glad

5571.0 --> 5573.42
to hear that

5574.66 --> 5580.37
[Music]

5578.26 --> 5583.59
yeah I had an interesting show today

5580.37 --> 5583.59
[Music]

5588.58 --> 5595.179
that's my elaborate

5591.82 --> 5598.96
what do you call that postulation

5595.179 --> 5602.139
is it approximation my suggestion of an

5598.96 --> 5607.0
alteration to how politics is done

5602.139 --> 5609.36
a certain hardcore rules for it in order

5607.0 --> 5611.92
to prevent this

5609.36 --> 5614.799999999999
standardized Calamity situation that's

5611.92 --> 5617.679
been going on for what must be like two

5614.8 --> 5620.1990000000005
or three decade now slowly building up

5617.679 --> 5623.38
it's gonna get worse like this is not

5620.199 --> 5627.099999999999
the Capstone like it's gonna get worse

5623.38 --> 5629.08
and worse and worse and so much worse

5627.1 --> 5631.4800000000005
that everybody could literally lose

5629.08 --> 5633.699
their minds like that everybody will

5631.48 --> 5636.459999999999
lose their minds I might even lose my

5633.699 --> 5638.08
mind if nothing is done and this keeps

5636.46 --> 5641.08
on going and going because that would

5638.08 --> 5643.48
simply mean oh so if you're a politician

5641.08 --> 5648.28
put into a position

5643.48 --> 5650.379999999999
of anything then you can literally just

5648.28 --> 5653.86
get everybody killed and it wouldn't

5650.38 --> 5655.54
matter because you get away with it yeah

5653.86 --> 5658.12
it's too much

5655.54 --> 5660.219
it needs to end and that's what I well

5658.12 --> 5661.719
dedicated a big chunk of this Hangout

5660.219 --> 5663.82
Too

5661.719 --> 5667.56
how would you do that

5663.82 --> 5667.5599999999995
why is that necessary

5668.32 --> 5673.179
and why

5670.42 --> 5676.0
is everybody in Media

5673.179 --> 5678.82
seemingly scared of it

5676.0 --> 5681.58
why are they scared of this suggestion

5678.82 --> 5684.299999999999
that maybe politicians should get the

5681.58 --> 5684.3
death penalty

5684.88 --> 5690.159000000001
for turning 180 degrees on their

5687.76 --> 5694.5
election promises maybe they should

5690.159 --> 5694.5
actually officially get that

5695.199 --> 5702.638999999999
as like a new constitutional rule

5699.58 --> 5704.32
I think that would be great

5702.639 --> 5706.84
and that's what I well that's what most

5704.32 --> 5708.54
of the show today was about

5706.84 --> 5712.179
anyway

5708.54 --> 5715.179
I I can't figure out how to put it in a

5712.179 --> 5718.7390000000005
title without yeah

5715.179 --> 5718.7390000000005
getting unwanted attention

5758.86 --> 5763.36
what

5760.36 --> 5763.36
okay

5763.9 --> 5768.638999999999
well

5765.58 --> 5771.1
I wasn't even going to like make an item

5768.639 --> 5773.139
out of asking for donations but after

5771.1 --> 5775.84
that piece of [ __ ]

5773.139 --> 5779.56
I'd have to say yeah

5775.84 --> 5782.08
please donate to my PayPal completely on

5779.56 --> 5784.719
a voluntary basis and

5782.08 --> 5787.3
it's like do it if you got it if you

5784.719 --> 5789.28
don't got it then that's okay I mean if

5787.3 --> 5792.58
you're poor I'm not going to expect that

5789.28 --> 5793.78
you give me your last few Euros or

5792.58 --> 5796.239
dollars

5793.78 --> 5797.92
just because you really really want to

5796.239 --> 5799.239
help or because you're really really

5797.92 --> 5801.639
thankful

5799.239 --> 5804.638999999999
yeah I want you

5801.639 --> 5806.38
first and foremost to be able to keep it

5804.639 --> 5808.36
together that's part of the reason why I

5806.38 --> 5810.639
even do this

5808.36 --> 5813.699
a side reason it's not the main reason

5810.639 --> 5817.0
I'm not trying to keep you all sane but

5813.699 --> 5817.29
yeah if my followers don't keep it

5817.0 --> 5818.32
together

5817.29 --> 5821.26
[Music]

5818.32 --> 5823.659
then that for me on a very pragmatic

5821.26 --> 5826.659000000001
note is gonna be bad on the long run

5823.659 --> 5829.42
so please donate to my PayPal

5826.659 --> 5832.0
completely voluntarily

5829.42 --> 5834.52
in the other day somebody said

5832.0 --> 5836.139
Somebody's message me like oh [ __ ] I

5834.52 --> 5838.42
send the PayPal but I can't actually

5836.139 --> 5840.9400000000005
afford that could you send it back I'll

5838.42 --> 5842.26
send it back I did immediately

5840.94 --> 5844.799999999999
no problem

5842.26 --> 5844.8
right

5845.139 --> 5851.1990000000005
nobody has to donate it's all voluntary

5848.1 --> 5852.6990000000005
but if you get something out of my shows

5851.199 --> 5854.199

5852.699 --> 5856.36
here you like communicating with the

5854.199 --> 5859.36
other guys then well

5856.36 --> 5862.48
supporting me is going to effectively be

5859.36 --> 5865.32
the thing that will guarantee the

5862.48 --> 5869.0199999999995
continuation of it so it's that simple

5865.32 --> 5872.5599999999995

I mean getting the money is awesome

6006.719 --> 6012.96
especially when I need it but getting it

6009.32 --> 6015.179

complains about me getting money for

6015.179 --> 6019.92
what I do here

6016.8 --> 6023.639
it's just a this extra little magic

6019.92 --> 6024.96
that's just so satisfying you know so I

6023.639 --> 6028.38
just had to do it
