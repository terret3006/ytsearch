[Music]

147.599 --> 149.92
so

150.959 --> 161.68
how are you all doing uh

156.72 --> 164.64
gonna take it nice and slow today again

161.68 --> 164.64000000000001
just to keep calm

165.84 --> 170.0
but yeah yesterday there was plenty of

168.08 --> 172.239
stuff happening

170.0 --> 173.28
it was a flat earth debate replay from

172.239 --> 176.48000000000002
thursday

173.28 --> 180.48
which lasted like very long

176.48 --> 183.44
it was almost three hours total

180.48 --> 184.48
flatters debate after show and yeah we

183.44 --> 188.8
nathan

184.48 --> 192.56
and me too eventually were added with ed

188.8 --> 193.68
and akuma virus and at the end i just

192.56 --> 196.8
got so

193.68 --> 197.519
infuriated and that's pretty much also

196.8 --> 200.64000000000001
like the

197.519 --> 202.159
very audible the last moment in the

200.64 --> 205.599
debate before nathan found

202.159 --> 208.64
out but it was a great blast sitting

205.599 --> 211.35999999999999
there in the chat with others

208.64 --> 213.599
because it was a pretty intense show

211.36 --> 214.08
very psychological and nathan was like

213.599 --> 218.879
really

214.08 --> 218.87900000000002
on point with his focus

219.12 --> 227.84
like really pushing that and it was

221.2 --> 227.83999999999997
pretty good

231.599 --> 237.76
yeah there was a ball buster's premiere

234.879 --> 241.439
which was also a good show by the way

237.76 --> 246.319
although it was from some time ago

241.439 --> 249.68
uh i don't think i was even in that

246.319 --> 251.35999999999999
was before i joined i think in like the

249.68 --> 253.68
earliest phases

251.36 --> 255.84
but it was a pretty good show to listen

253.68 --> 255.84
to

262.0 --> 267.04
right yeah flat ball yeah i reported on

265.28 --> 268.79999999999995
that yesterday

267.04 --> 270.47900000000004
i still don't know exactly like

268.8 --> 272.08
everything that came from it i'm sure

270.479 --> 276.15999999999997
you guys have followed

272.08 --> 283.84
other streams that talked about it

276.16 --> 283.84000000000003
i i did not really do that

286.24 --> 297.24
all right he's seeking star wars

289.28 --> 300.4
flat ball good servant

297.24 --> 303.52
anasazi petroglyphs

300.4 --> 303.52
i don't know what that is

308.84 --> 311.84
hmm

312.88 --> 319.68
right also uh yeah another weird thing

317.36 --> 319.68
um

320.96 --> 328.479
yeah nathan thompson also did something

325.199 --> 330.32
he had a live live stream this group of

328.479 --> 332.479
people he was accompanied by a couple of

330.32 --> 334.71999999999997
other flat earthers

332.479 --> 335.919
and they were basically having a just an

334.72 --> 339.28000000000003
open

335.919 --> 342.0
long discussion

339.28 --> 343.039
but there were some apparently some

342.0 --> 346.479
issues with

343.039 --> 346.479
it so i heard

346.8 --> 350.72
although i don't know i have not dug

349.52 --> 353.84
into the details

350.72 --> 353.84000000000003
of that

354.24 --> 357.36
he got pranked right that's what i got

357.039 --> 360.639
her

357.36 --> 362.24
what i heard from rasta is that those

360.639 --> 365.52
guys were not

362.24 --> 366.0
whatever you call them phds or didn't

365.52 --> 370.56
look like

366.0 --> 370.56
it was just a bunch of students at best

374.639 --> 378.08
but then again look it's nathan thompson

377.36 --> 382.08000000000004
right

378.08 --> 382.08
he might be trying like a

382.56 --> 386.0
mark sergeant method here

387.44 --> 392.56
you know he already said it like he

389.52 --> 394.96
literally does not give a [ __ ]

392.56 --> 397.44
about what people think of him and he

394.96 --> 401.35999999999996
really means that

397.44 --> 404.8
that is that he is willing to

401.36 --> 407.039
basically push forth even if that means

404.8 --> 409.36
he's going to be paraded like a clown

407.039 --> 409.84
like that and mark sargent is the same

409.36 --> 411.599
like that

409.84 --> 413.35999999999996
it's just a different type of guy with a

411.599 --> 416.4
different

413.36 --> 419.84000000000003
skill range but

416.4 --> 422.56
i think that might be his plan

419.84 --> 424.4
as it were but you don't know how that's

422.56 --> 427.599
going to unfold you never really do

424.4 --> 431.12
until it happens and yeah

427.599 --> 431.12
i'm sure he's warned about it

431.28 --> 434.55999999999995
but yeah i think nathan thompson gets

433.12 --> 438.24
warned about a lot

434.56 --> 440.8
that usually it's not easy to deter

438.24 --> 442.24
him from doing something once he gets an

440.8 --> 446.72
idea

442.24 --> 449.52
it's kind of forte as they call that

446.72 --> 450.319
just once that idea gets in with him he

449.52 --> 453.44
just does

450.319 --> 453.44
[ __ ] so

459.199 --> 462.72
but yeah we'll see what happens with

462.84 --> 467.75899999999996
that

464.62 --> 467.759
[Music]

470.16 --> 474.40000000000003
right good to know good servant i wasn't

472.96 --> 477.28
sure i tried to look up

474.4 --> 479.35999999999996
if jaron went live but there was no

477.28 --> 482.479
notification

479.36 --> 484.0
or anything although it might have just

482.479 --> 488.08
a he i don't know he might be

484.0 --> 488.08
exclusively streaming on d live now

488.639 --> 493.84000000000003
and yeah i don't get retroactive

490.8 --> 493.84000000000003
notifications of that

504.16 --> 508.639
yeah seeking star wars the thing is if

507.039 --> 510.479
youtube

508.639 --> 512.5600000000001
if there's something going on and it is

510.479 --> 515.8389999999999
taken down

512.56 --> 519.1999999999999
or removed or anything you still have it

515.839 --> 519.2
in the notification list

519.44 --> 522.8800000000001
because something happened you know

522.08 --> 524.72
that's how

522.88 --> 526.08
somebody when they have startup problems

524.72 --> 528.64
and then they restart up

526.08 --> 531.12
and then again you literally get a list

528.64 --> 535.04
of six notifications

531.12 --> 537.68
that doesn't go away because it happened

535.04 --> 538.0799999999999
see so i was a bit surprised to just not

537.68 --> 541.519
see

538.08 --> 548.5600000000001
any notifications whatsoever

541.519 --> 552.05
about it that was weird

548.56 --> 555.2099999999999
okay i guess you guys saw it i i didn't

552.05 --> 555.2099999999999
[Music]

557.279 --> 561.2
i just stayed up incredibly late again

559.6 --> 563.2
in gaming and

561.2 --> 565.6800000000001
way too late i don't like it that it was

563.2 --> 565.6800000000001
so late

571.12 --> 575.12
but there was yeah yesterday was a day

572.72 --> 576.72
of a lot of energy release

575.12 --> 579.6
there were a lot of things happening

576.72 --> 585.12
here like here in this house

579.6 --> 585.12
because like uh the roommates

585.44 --> 588.72
okay from downstairs and girl right next

587.92 --> 590.399
and friends

588.72 --> 591.76
of theirs because they are friends in

590.399 --> 594.399
the circle

591.76 --> 594.8
basically started yeah there was a lot

594.399 --> 598.24
of

594.8 --> 601.8389999999999
stuff piling up for throwing out

598.24 --> 603.92
that's like yeah just there's like

601.839 --> 605.2790000000001
three flight of stairs you gotta have to

603.92 --> 608.399
go down this

605.279 --> 610.399
and all that there's no lift no elevator

608.399 --> 612.64
so yeah it's kind of been piling up

610.399 --> 614.48
because nobody really has a car and it's

612.64 --> 616.16
just a huge hassle to do that well

614.48 --> 619.6
friend brought a car they and

616.16 --> 621.8389999999999
like clean up the place really good

619.6 --> 622.72
i also took the opportunity basically to

621.839 --> 626.8000000000001
get all the

622.72 --> 630.399
yeah beer bottles gathering dust here

626.8 --> 630.399
to get those out also

630.959 --> 634.7199999999999
and yeah when that happens you know when

632.959 --> 636.7199999999999
something is when there's a lot of room

634.72 --> 639.519
made and things like really clean up

636.72 --> 642.72
a lot of the time there's just this

639.519 --> 642.72
energy released

642.959 --> 646.4799999999999
keeps you going even if you're not

644.959 --> 648.4799999999999
supposed to and that kind of happened to

646.48 --> 649.519
me yes i was just had a lot of energy so

648.48 --> 652.64
the day

649.519 --> 656.5600000000001
i even helped out one of yeah

652.64 --> 660.079
a girl that is part of the france circle

656.56 --> 662.959
another one different one

660.079 --> 664.56
and she's like kind of cute and i think

662.959 --> 666.4799999999999
that maybe she thinks i'm kind of cute

664.56 --> 668.3199999999999
too i don't know maybe i've just been

666.48 --> 674.0
single for too long

668.32 --> 676.5600000000001
but yeah i kind of like her

674.0 --> 677.519
had like a weird issue where yeah she

676.56 --> 679.92
had basically

677.519 --> 681.279
it's just this silly little personal

679.92 --> 683.68
drama but

681.279 --> 685.8389999999999
like she's this cannabis smoker too and

683.68 --> 688.3199999999999
she's yeah she had this special money

685.839 --> 691.6
saved up for a very long time

688.32 --> 692.6400000000001
for a special occasion to then she

691.6 --> 694.9590000000001
bought

692.64 --> 697.68
cannabis with it and then on the way

694.959 --> 700.16
apparently she lost it somewhere

697.68 --> 701.04
when she like really was looking forward

700.16 --> 703.4399999999999
to it so it was

701.04 --> 704.3199999999999
just a super hard bummer for her it's

703.44 --> 706.8000000000001
like really

704.32 --> 707.9200000000001
sucky so i thought like nobody else had

706.8 --> 710.4799999999999
kind of said that like yeah

707.92 --> 713.36
i'm just gonna give her i'm just gonna

710.48 --> 716.399
roll one of my super joints

713.36 --> 720.0
with organic

716.399 --> 722.16
raw tobacco from canada and all the

720.0 --> 724.639
carbon filters and everything roll it

722.16 --> 727.68
and share a joint with her so

724.639 --> 729.6800000000001
yeah to lessen the blow and she really

727.68 --> 734.56
appreciated that

729.68 --> 734.56
so i don't know it was good

734.72 --> 740.639
and she is kind of cute very spirited

740.72 --> 744.0790000000001
i think she probably got a lot of strong

743.68 --> 745.8389999999999
mother

744.079 --> 747.3599999999999
instinct or something i don't know i'm

745.839 --> 752.8000000000001
saying for too long

747.36 --> 752.8000000000001
this is but that was kind of nice

755.839 --> 759.44
and also they basically said like yeah

757.839 --> 763.839
you are welcome in the friend

759.44 --> 766.8800000000001
circle people rarely say that

763.839 --> 768.8800000000001
or in general say such a thing so when i

766.88 --> 769.2
hear that it's like really like oh [ __ ]

768.88 --> 773.279
i'm

769.2 --> 777.2
i'm i'm welcome i have

773.279 --> 779.279
a friend circle it's not exactly what i

777.2 --> 782.88
expected

779.279 --> 784.16
but i guess i do yay i got a friend

782.88 --> 787.92
circle of

784.16 --> 791.04
mostly gays and lesbians but that are

787.92 --> 794.079
kind of nice and not

791.04 --> 796.639
delusional as much

794.079 --> 796.6389999999999
as some

797.12 --> 801.839
they're just like a fun-loving group

806.639 --> 809.839
and yeah i've had plenty of nice

807.92 --> 813.5999999999999
conversations it's fun

809.839 --> 814.0
for me like oh wait i sort of have a

813.6 --> 817.6
friends

814.0 --> 817.6
group that's interesting

819.6 --> 825.6800000000001
it's been a long time you know like

823.279 --> 827.68
a close by friend circle because of

825.68 --> 831.519
course the internet

827.68 --> 831.519
and all that but that's different

833.04 --> 843.8389999999999
what are you talking about hey nathan

834.959 --> 843.8389999999999
nice and oaky

854.839 --> 860.5600000000001
so

857.44 --> 860.5600000000001
my medallion

866.36 --> 871.839
[Music]

868.839 --> 871.839
hmm

874.0 --> 878.32
watching ads is harwin saying hello

881.279 --> 884.8
well at least i turned the non-skippable

883.68 --> 888.959
ads off

884.8 --> 888.959
so it'll be like five seconds and worst

889.6 --> 899.839
because yeah those non-skippable ones

891.519 --> 899.839
are really annoying

903.92 --> 907.279
all right although yeah i do really have

906.16 --> 910.48
to turn on

907.279 --> 912.24
all the ads every single time i start up

910.48 --> 915.1990000000001
a new stream

912.24 --> 917.519
it just doesn't default it anymore i

915.199 --> 919.4399999999999
don't know why

917.519 --> 921.36
like there's no way to just have a

919.44 --> 926.1600000000001
default

921.36 --> 929.36
go live setting it remembers the text

926.16 --> 930.56
you put in the description box why

929.36 --> 934.16
doesn't it

930.56 --> 936.7199999999999
remember the marked choices

934.16 --> 937.68
you made in the rest of that list i

936.72 --> 940.24
don't get it

937.68 --> 943.8389999999999
i really don't get you sometimes youtube

940.24 --> 943.839
it makes no freaking sense

950.32 --> 955.839
hey vegan bear

956.48 --> 959.44
hey amanda young

962.8 --> 967.519
yeah it's taking up setting up the show

965.279 --> 973.519
takes an extra five minutes

967.519 --> 973.519
well normally it would take me

976.639 --> 982.24
like two minutes now it is taking me a

979.519 --> 984.8
total of five minutes

982.24 --> 986.9590000000001
i guess although i have gotten quicker

984.8 --> 989.92
at it so i am adapting

986.959 --> 990.4799999999999
but it's just it doesn't make sense that

989.92 --> 995.8389999999999
there's

990.48 --> 998.72
no better default systems for going

995.839 --> 998.72
takes you ages

999.92 --> 1004.24
right but you also have to basically

1002.48 --> 1006.8000000000001
schedule the playbacks

1004.24 --> 1009.12
and all that probably right and the

1006.8 --> 1010.16
premiere and whether it's members only

1009.12 --> 1011.759
so you have to

1010.16 --> 1014.56
go through a lot more hassle i can

1011.759 --> 1014.5600000000001
imagine nathan

1022.0 --> 1027.36
ten programs

1025.039 --> 1027.36
well

1033.6 --> 1040.559
well for me i'm still only just using

1037.36 --> 1044.319
youtube and obs

1040.559 --> 1045.839
that seems to do the trick although i

1044.319 --> 1049.6789999999999
often still have sound

1045.839 --> 1052.3999999999999
issues that make no damn sense

1049.679 --> 1054.24
no damn sense at all like for some

1052.4 --> 1056.72
reason the

1054.24 --> 1059.36
the balance between the sound sometimes

1056.72 --> 1061.6000000000001
subtly goes completely asymmetrical

1059.36 --> 1064.3999999999999
then i have to like tinker in the

1061.6 --> 1069.039
settings to get it even again

1064.4 --> 1071.1200000000001
even even and then suddenly it goes back

1069.039 --> 1072.4
after a while for no damn reason if

1071.12 --> 1076.0
there is like

1072.4 --> 1077.039
why what the hell is going on with this

1076.0 --> 1081.039
thing

1077.039 --> 1084.0
this uh

1081.039 --> 1084.0
it's just that

1085.36 --> 1088.9599999999998
it's funny how that all balances out you

1088.0 --> 1090.96
know

1088.96 --> 1092.64
like computer programs computer

1090.96 --> 1096.799
interfaces

1092.64 --> 1100.0800000000002
things for doing things making

1096.799 --> 1102.32
footage whatever it all seems so fast

1100.08 --> 1107.039
and quick and more efficient

1102.32 --> 1111.2
but the more time has progressed

1107.039 --> 1111.2
my experience in the last 30 years

1111.6 --> 1115.36
the more unstable

1116.32 --> 1123.28
like elements of program

1119.36 --> 1126.559
functions have become

1123.28 --> 1126.96
in ways like spread around it's like it

1126.559 --> 1129.9189999999999
has

1126.96 --> 1133.44
ups and downs like it's like sometimes

1129.919 --> 1133.44
it gets really diluted

1133.52 --> 1137.84
i guess windows typically has a hand in

1136.08 --> 1140.3999999999999
this sort of thing

1137.84 --> 1142.48
and microsoft bring out a program is

1140.4 --> 1145.52
riddled with bugs

1142.48 --> 1147.919
and then they slowly start to fix it

1145.52 --> 1150.32
but a lot of chaos comes forth from it

1147.919 --> 1152.88
being a mess and people still using it

1150.32 --> 1152.8799999999999
right away

1154.88 --> 1158.88
but yeah that's a set that was a

1156.96 --> 1161.28
separate issue i have not had trouble

1158.88 --> 1162.0
since i basically refused to switch

1161.28 --> 1165.6
after

1162.0 --> 1167.039
windows 7 because yeah everything still

1165.6 --> 1170.24
works

1167.039 --> 1174.8799999999999
you just have to be careful not

1170.24 --> 1179.6
to let in and

1174.88 --> 1182.24
like an operating system destroyer

1179.6 --> 1183.12
because there is [ __ ] like that they

1182.24 --> 1185.919
just say

1183.12 --> 1186.6399999999999
you do this you do that or you have to

1185.919 --> 1190.24
update

1186.64 --> 1190.88
for no damn actual reason to get the new

1190.24 --> 1194.24
program

1190.88 --> 1197.679
used right i know

1194.24 --> 1200.96
it's all [ __ ] it's all

1197.679 --> 1204.799
just nonsensical coercion to

1200.96 --> 1208.159
railroad people against their will even

1204.799 --> 1208.1589999999999
into a development

1208.559 --> 1212.08
where nobody's knee really needs to go

1211.039 --> 1215.52
that's just what

1212.08 --> 1217.4399999999998
they want they want to turn

1215.52 --> 1218.8799999999999
all all the systems all the computers

1217.44 --> 1222.799
into absolute

1218.88 --> 1224.0800000000002
mind control basically condition you

1222.799 --> 1226.96
that you have no

1224.08 --> 1227.52
choice that's what they want makes no

1226.96 --> 1232.72
[ __ ]

1227.52 --> 1232.72
sense from a pragmatic standpoint

1233.36 --> 1238.799
right it's still slowly happening and

1236.24 --> 1242.32
i've been trying to defend against that

1238.799 --> 1244.32
for a long time and refusing to yeah to

1242.32 --> 1245.9189999999999
update the operating system is one of

1244.32 --> 1250.32
them just don't

1245.919 --> 1253.2800000000002
need it just need to make sure

1250.32 --> 1254.1589999999999
you don't accidentally get some

1253.28 --> 1257.2
operating

1254.159 --> 1259.44
destroying system on your computer

1257.2 --> 1260.96
and then things will be all right and

1259.44 --> 1263.1200000000001
that includes from

1260.96 --> 1264.08
freaking windows itself including

1263.12 --> 1267.28
updates

1264.08 --> 1269.12
they make you take updates like

1267.28 --> 1270.6399999999999
really peer pressuring you like it's

1269.12 --> 1273.76
necessary that then

1270.64 --> 1276.72
literally destroys it so you must

1273.76 --> 1279.44
update because it doesn't work anymore

1276.72 --> 1279.44
it's what they do

1288.0 --> 1294.24
all right but yeah over time it just

1292.559 --> 1299.6
seems to me like there's just

1294.24 --> 1299.6
more instabilities in software

1300.72 --> 1304.0
or maybe it's just equal now and it's

1303.679 --> 1308.64
just

1304.0 --> 1311.28
there's more software to notice it on

1308.64 --> 1313.3600000000001
and people use a lot of software a lot

1311.28 --> 1316.72
more regularly now with the internet and

1313.36 --> 1319.039
just automatically running systems and

1316.72 --> 1320.08
of course back in the day 20 years ago

1319.039 --> 1322.0
there yeah

1320.08 --> 1324.0
it's just the computer you start it up

1322.0 --> 1325.2
you process some data you do something

1324.0 --> 1328.24
with it

1325.2 --> 1328.88
you store it you copy it somewhere it's

1328.24 --> 1332.88
a different

1328.88 --> 1336.3200000000002
type of yeah different approach

1332.88 --> 1339.7600000000002
now software spreads around easy

1336.32 --> 1347.84
but yeah that also means that bugs

1339.76 --> 1347.84
spread around more easily

1348.72 --> 1351.039
hmm

1354.72 --> 1359.919
jesus nathan yeah yeah yeah you're

1357.28 --> 1362.3999999999999
making it into a giant multitasking

1359.919 --> 1362.4
system

1369.52 --> 1374.559
like a like a studio manager type of

1372.84 --> 1389.84
situation

1374.559 --> 1389.84
the guy behind the the board

1393.2 --> 1395.679
all right

1399.28 --> 1403.039
yeah when you started g plus an air and

1401.28 --> 1406.08
that was it right it was

1403.039 --> 1408.4
for me the same right until

1406.08 --> 1416.0
basically the google panel just didn't

1408.4 --> 1418.72
function as i wanted anymore

1416.0 --> 1421.039
now i i can still use skype that works

1418.72 --> 1421.039
fine

1424.24 --> 1428.159
i don't i rarely have guests on anymore

1428.84 --> 1431.84
anyway

1452.72 --> 1459.2
okay well seeking star wars look if

1456.0 --> 1463.039
if you've never done it before like ever

1459.2 --> 1466.0800000000002
going live with youtube that's yeah

1463.039 --> 1466.08
of course you need help

1466.159 --> 1472.159
or unless you're like really kind of

1468.559 --> 1472.96
tech savvy good with interfaces not

1472.159 --> 1476.0
scared of

1472.96 --> 1477.76
complicated things you need to do

1476.0 --> 1479.679
that you've never done if yeah if you're

1477.76 --> 1481.279
good with that you could probably start

1479.679 --> 1483.2
plenty people that can but not everybody

1481.279 --> 1485.279
can do that i am one of those people

1483.2 --> 1487.76
that is not very good at that

1485.279 --> 1490.559
but because of now yeah people helping

1487.76 --> 1493.36
me out in the beginning a lot

1490.559 --> 1496.1589999999999
then finding some confidence a bit more

1493.36 --> 1498.32
oversight now i know more about it

1496.159 --> 1500.64
but yeah i didn't start out like that as

1498.32 --> 1515.84
well so

1500.64 --> 1515.8400000000001
i wouldn't sweat it

1516.65 --> 1523.279
[Music]

1519.44 --> 1523.279
go live on your own mobile

1523.679 --> 1529.8400000000001
right but then you only have a video

1526.84 --> 1529.84
screen

1535.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
have whichever yeah i could

1545.919 --> 1554.22
70 mile visibility wow

1550.78 --> 1554.22
[Music]

1554.84 --> 1557.84
okay

1569.36 --> 1572.7199999999998
uh

1570.03 --> 1576.1589999999999
[Music]

1572.72 --> 1578.559
okay well can you then call me on skype

1576.159 --> 1578.5590000000002
i guess

1579.279 --> 1585.84
seeking star wars

1591.279 --> 1599.84
do i have you on skype

1612.4 --> 1615.8400000000001
i can't find you i have too many people

1614.559 --> 1627.84
on skype

1615.84 --> 1627.84
it's crazy

1635.679 --> 1655.8400000000001
no it's not our win7 so it's an

1638.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
i my god good servant

1658.06 --> 1662.1589999999999
[Music]

1659.279 --> 1663.65
but not yet my phone has been broke oh

1662.159 --> 1666.779
okay

1663.65 --> 1666.779
[Music]

1666.84 --> 1672.279
uh that

1669.19 --> 1672.279
[Music]

1680.84 --> 1685.6299999999999
sucks

1682.5 --> 1685.63
[Music]

1685.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
all right well sorry i can't really help

1687.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
you then

1698.89 --> 1702.0890000000002
[Music]

1706.32 --> 1711.6
what screen was broken by the repair

1709.279 --> 1714.24
person oh god

1711.6 --> 1714.24
that's lame

1722.84 --> 1725.84
okay

1729.36 --> 1733.9189999999999
man i i can't tell you how many times

1733.279 --> 1737.52
i've seen

1733.919 --> 1740.24
people with broken screens

1737.52 --> 1742.32
it's like everywhere it's like all

1740.24 --> 1745.919
freaking broken screens

1742.32 --> 1745.9189999999999
it's like what the [ __ ] people

1746.72 --> 1751.52
is that a good design when that [ __ ]

1749.52 --> 1754.08
happens

1751.52 --> 1756.559
so he's like is that actually a good

1754.08 --> 1756.559
design

1758.24 --> 1762.08
like not just like oh the newer model no

1761.6 --> 1765.6789999999999
no

1762.08 --> 1770.6399999999999
in general is it actually a good design

1765.679 --> 1773.279
it just freaking breaks so damn easy

1770.64 --> 1774.48
and like really noticeably like that

1773.279 --> 1777.44
might function but it's like

1774.48 --> 1779.44
really in your face yeah it's broken is

1777.44 --> 1782.559
that a good design

1779.44 --> 1783.279
when that's like everywhere i don't know

1782.559 --> 1787.9189999999999
man

1783.279 --> 1787.919
like i'd never liked the entire thing

1793.12 --> 1799.52
i i just i just can't

1797.679 --> 1802.0
it's like i've tried to imagine what it

1799.52 --> 1802.96
would be like if i would force myself to

1802.0 --> 1805.2
basically start

1802.96 --> 1807.279
engaging with those things like to

1805.2 --> 1810.72
master it to be able to

1807.279 --> 1814.64
do all these things and i just

1810.72 --> 1817.84
even as i imagine it it's just that

1814.64 --> 1821.279
almost every [ __ ] thing about it i

1817.84 --> 1824.399
hate the freaking small screen

1821.279 --> 1828.64
i hate touch screen i

1824.399 --> 1832.1589999999999
hate tracking devices

1828.64 --> 1836.64
i hate freaking radiation

1832.159 --> 1839.0390000000002
constantly i hate

1836.64 --> 1839.039
it's i

1844.799 --> 1848.1589999999999
hate is a big word it's just

1848.84 --> 1851.84
why

1865.44 --> 1870.72
right anyway yeah well if it's breakable

1869.44 --> 1872.64
that means you're going to bring it to a

1870.72 --> 1876.84
repair shop and that means that they can

1872.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
literally steal all the metadata out of

1876.84 --> 1879.84
it

1880.399 --> 1886.32
then they're not going to store it but

1883.44 --> 1893.8400000000001
it's going to be analyzed

1886.32 --> 1893.84
and the analysis will be stored

1895.84 --> 1909.519
i think

1906.96 --> 1910.559
yeah the screen breaking you could even

1909.519 --> 1914.3990000000001
consider it it's

1910.559 --> 1917.279
literally an incentive to like have you

1914.399 --> 1918.559
given your metadata that you collected

1917.279 --> 1921.2
with your device

1918.559 --> 1922.0
to the mega corporation yet is it time

1921.2 --> 1923.44
again to give

1922.0 --> 1926.08
all your metadata to the mega

1923.44 --> 1926.799
corporation again is it that time again

1926.08 --> 1935.84
yeah

1926.799 --> 1935.84
yeah that's how i see that [ __ ]

1939.41 --> 1942.63
[Music]

1946.59 --> 1949.6399999999999
[Music]

1955.6 --> 1962.08
metadata is

1959.039 --> 1964.24
profiling information of everything you

1962.08 --> 1964.24
do

1966.08 --> 1970.24
and you'd be surprised what certain type

1968.399 --> 1974.32
of algorithms can do

1970.24 --> 1976.88
with just traces of some of that data

1974.32 --> 1978.0
especially when combined with all of

1976.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
that data of

1978.0 --> 1991.84
everything and everyone else

1994.0 --> 1998.399
so metadata for example is cookies

1996.799 --> 2001.12
tracing cookies

1998.399 --> 2001.12
very basic

2003.2 --> 2009.44
or just like

2006.399 --> 2013.279
yeah where have you visited

2009.44 --> 2016.72
like what have you been doing that's it

2013.279 --> 2020.72
or even like hey what type of

2016.72 --> 2023.6000000000001
interests can we deduce from

2020.72 --> 2025.84
what you have done that's the sort of

2023.6 --> 2029.1999999999998
[ __ ]

2025.84 --> 2029.76
metadata is all about information side

2029.2 --> 2032.64
effect

2029.76 --> 2034.48
information of what a person does that

2032.64 --> 2038.0800000000002
helps

2034.48 --> 2047.84
profile them basically size up

2038.08 --> 2047.84
what they are what they're gonna do

2084.48 --> 2089.839
that google track shoe is really handy

2086.639 --> 2089.839
it can be

2091.28 --> 2095.119
you know that's how it always starts out

2093.679 --> 2097.44
it's very handy

2095.119 --> 2099.599
it's very like oh convenient home easy

2097.44 --> 2102.0
oh smart system

2099.599 --> 2104.4
take over for you it's so efficient oh

2102.0 --> 2108.4
it knows what you want before you do it

2104.4 --> 2108.4
until it flips around

2109.839 --> 2113.44
and then suddenly you don't really want

2112.079 --> 2116.96
it to know what

2113.44 --> 2119.119
what you're doing and they will anyway

2116.96 --> 2120.0
because you already gave them everything

2119.119 --> 2123.28
they need

2120.0 --> 2125.68
to predict everything you do even before

2123.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
you know you're gonna do it

2125.68 --> 2131.839
not literally but effectively

2143.43 --> 2147.52
[Music]

2145.28 --> 2147.52
right

2150.24 --> 2158.0
but it's also up to what is in control

2153.76 --> 2160.7200000000003
what is directing

2158.0 --> 2173.839
these systems what is being done with

2160.72 --> 2173.839
the metadata

2175.28 --> 2181.52
because yeah meta data can also

2178.32 --> 2182.96
quite effectively be utilized to improve

2181.52 --> 2185.52
a product

2182.96 --> 2186.0
absolutely it used to be called basic

2185.52 --> 2187.68
market

2186.0 --> 2189.28
research it's like okay there's a

2187.68 --> 2192.64
product made

2189.28 --> 2194.1600000000003
like a technological new thing then they

2192.64 --> 2197.5989999999997
hand out a bunch of free

2194.16 --> 2199.2799999999997
ones maybe give like prizes away with oh

2197.599 --> 2202.32
you got the newest thing

2199.28 --> 2205.76
just to promote it and then they

2202.32 --> 2207.599
yeah people

2205.76 --> 2210.079
use it and then afterward they

2207.599 --> 2211.6800000000003
absolutely want to know what you thought

2210.079 --> 2215.6800000000003
of it

2211.68 --> 2219.2799999999997
now you can improve it

2215.68 --> 2219.68
so that they will then adapt to what

2219.28 --> 2222.96
they've

2219.68 --> 2223.359
learned in the field oh metadata does

2222.96 --> 2229.839
that

2223.359 --> 2229.839
in a similar way

2232.48 --> 2237.119
and youtube keeps on stalling it's so

2238.59 --> 2243.839
[Music]

2240.839 --> 2243.839
annoying

2249.44 --> 2253.68
how do you protect your metadata you

2254.839 --> 2257.839
can't

2259.92 --> 2263.599
the only way to truly protect your

2261.839 --> 2267.119
metadata is by doing

2263.599 --> 2269.28
nothing through computers deleting

2267.119 --> 2271.6800000000003
all cookies at all times which makes

2269.28 --> 2274.88
things very clumsy

2271.68 --> 2276.48
and even impossible to do certain like

2274.88 --> 2278.7200000000003
do web shops

2276.48 --> 2279.76
it's impossible without them getting

2278.72 --> 2283.2799999999997
your metadate it's

2279.76 --> 2283.28
literally impossible

2283.359 --> 2286.7999999999997
now they vow they don't use it it

2285.28 --> 2289.3590000000004
doesn't mean that they can't

2286.8 --> 2291.28
detract information from it they're just

2289.359 --> 2294.0789999999997
not gonna store it

2291.28 --> 2295.52
like having your data publicly available

2294.079 --> 2299.2000000000003
that don't do that

2295.52 --> 2304.8
but they will damn well use

2299.2 --> 2304.7999999999997
it this is everything does

2306.4 --> 2309.6800000000003
unless they give you a giant page

2308.64 --> 2311.5989999999997
explaining you

2309.68 --> 2313.2799999999997
how they specifically don't do that

2311.599 --> 2313.839
because they are aimed at a public

2313.28 --> 2317.52
that's

2313.839 --> 2317.52
like very concerned about that

2318.16 --> 2321.92
that doesn't really happen a lot anymore

2322.4 --> 2326.2400000000002
it used to happen a lot more 10 years

2325.28 --> 2329.6800000000003
ago

2326.24 --> 2332.24
uh what kind of

2329.68 --> 2334.16
phone do i use i use a non-internet

2332.24 --> 2338.24
phone a very basic phone

2334.16 --> 2342.0
that you can text message people with

2338.24 --> 2344.16
and call them by telephone

2342.0 --> 2345.44
and you can even take a photograph with

2344.16 --> 2348.7999999999997
it

2345.44 --> 2348.8
i think and you know

2350.56 --> 2356.32
yeah but i think it doesn't have much of

2354.24 --> 2359.2
a memory so

2356.32 --> 2359.6800000000003
i think i can store like 10 photographs

2359.2 --> 2362.56
so that's

2359.68 --> 2364.96
it i i don't care i haven't really even

2362.56 --> 2364.96
tried

2365.52 --> 2372.56
because i don't take my phone with me

2368.8 --> 2376.0
anywhere ever unless i really need it

2372.56 --> 2378.7999999999997
unless i am in need of a

2376.0 --> 2380.64
an option to be able to call somebody

2378.8 --> 2383.44
because i could get lost

2380.64 --> 2384.24
for some reason like on an excursion

2383.44 --> 2388.4
that's the

2384.24 --> 2392.56
only time i ever take a phone with me

2388.4 --> 2392.56
i don't take my phone with me ever

2392.96 --> 2398.96
it's yeah

2396.0 --> 2398.96
i just don't do that

2399.119 --> 2402.56
i never need to anyway

2403.44 --> 2408.48
only people that really call me if they

2406.4 --> 2409.44
would call me when i was on the road

2408.48 --> 2412.56
with the phone

2409.44 --> 2414.64
that would only get in my way anyway

2412.56 --> 2416.88
only just distract me waste my time ruin

2414.64 --> 2417.52
my schedule so i don't take my phone

2416.88 --> 2421.2000000000003
with me

2417.52 --> 2424.64
when i'm going out unless i

2421.2 --> 2428.48
need to be able to directly verbally

2424.64 --> 2428.48
contact somebody for some reason

2429.839 --> 2439.839
or need to be able to reach somebody

2444.72 --> 2451.2799999999997
what are you talking about

2447.839 --> 2455.599
george sanford shut

2451.28 --> 2460.1600000000003
my cpu down uh no

2455.599 --> 2462.319
it's just stalling the video stream

2460.16 --> 2464.24
that i see on youtube and it's every

2462.319 --> 2466.0
time it sounds seems to be me

2464.24 --> 2469.04
because nobody else is complaining about

2466.0 --> 2473.44
is me it's like again i'm seeing myself

2469.04 --> 2475.2799999999997
stall like what the hell

2473.44 --> 2477.04
sometimes it like stays like that for

2475.28 --> 2481.8390000000004
like two minutes or something if i don't

2477.04 --> 2481.839
pay attention it's so annoying

2506.839 --> 2509.839
so

2534.839 --> 2537.839
uh

2547.119 --> 2552.88
what shutting down your desktop

2550.48 --> 2555.599
daily helps with problems exactly like

2552.88 --> 2555.599
you are saying

2561.68 --> 2566.3999999999996
uh yeah the

2572.319 --> 2579.599
hard restart on modem and router

2575.599 --> 2582.6400000000003
that's interesting it usually

2579.599 --> 2584.2400000000002
ends up like that because

2582.64 --> 2586.64
you know sometimes my internet

2584.24 --> 2589.4399999999996
connection just breaks off

2586.64 --> 2590.8799999999997
and then if nobody's home down there

2589.44 --> 2594.0
yeah then i have to reset

2590.88 --> 2596.079
the electricity to restore the modem

2594.0 --> 2597.2
in order to get internet again so yeah

2596.079 --> 2600.0
it's

2597.2 --> 2602.72
it kind of automatically happens anyway

2600.0 --> 2602.72
because of that

2604.839 --> 2607.839
setup

2621.359 --> 2626.16
all right but disrupting open

2624.319 --> 2631.52
connections

2626.16 --> 2634.7999999999997
does often help prevent leeching

2631.52 --> 2637.44
because i'm gonna get a little

2634.8 --> 2639.28
tronny in the sense that i'm going to be

2637.44 --> 2641.92
very descriptive

2639.28 --> 2643.44
about something that could also by a

2641.92 --> 2645.44
technician be explained

2643.44 --> 2647.2000000000003
very exactly and technical which i

2645.44 --> 2651.119
cannot

2647.2 --> 2653.04
but i i got the impression

2651.119 --> 2655.28
from people talking about this sort of

2653.04 --> 2657.68
[ __ ] me not literally getting it

2655.28 --> 2659.76
but getting a feel for it that there is

2657.68 --> 2663.44
a possibility

2659.76 --> 2665.92
for basic to leech data over an open

2663.44 --> 2668.88
stream as long as it opened by basically

2665.92 --> 2671.04
placing an anchor somebody somewhere to

2668.88 --> 2673.92
establish the connection

2671.04 --> 2675.04
then sort of effectively deleting the

2673.92 --> 2678.4
anchor

2675.04 --> 2680.079
but leaving the line so there is no

2678.4 --> 2683.04
trace that there is anything

2680.079 --> 2684.319
tracing but as long as the connection is

2683.04 --> 2687.2
open

2684.319 --> 2690.56
there is a line until it closes and then

2687.2 --> 2696.16
the process would have to be repeated

2690.56 --> 2696.16
that effect and that is why resetting

2696.319 --> 2705.839
long running connections yeah

2700.72 --> 2705.839
that's what that should help against

2710.079 --> 2714.4
does that make any sense programmers

2711.839 --> 2714.4
heard of this

2714.64 --> 2719.7599999999998
i'm just saying it in a very descriptive

2717.28 --> 2722.0
way

2719.76 --> 2723.2000000000003
maybe it reminds you of another thing

2722.0 --> 2726.0
that somebody

2723.2 --> 2727.7599999999998
explained to you in a more technical

2726.0 --> 2732.079
sense of what that is

2727.76 --> 2734.2400000000002
i don't know but this seems logical

2732.079 --> 2735.28
that sort of gadgetry just works on

2734.24 --> 2738.3999999999996
computers with pro

2735.28 --> 2740.48
it's it's crazy what you could do like

2738.4 --> 2743.52
sometimes computers are dynamic

2740.48 --> 2745.04
in a way that is almost counterintuitive

2743.52 --> 2746.56
like they can do things that make no

2745.04 --> 2749.839
sense

2746.56 --> 2749.839
but they could do it anyway

2750.88 --> 2754.2400000000002
right and i think that this might be one

2752.72 --> 2757.52
of those things

2754.24 --> 2759.2799999999997
it's like a hack trick or something

2757.52 --> 2760.72
throw out an anchor on an open line

2759.28 --> 2762.5600000000004
that's constant

2760.72 --> 2764.319
then you delete the anchor and leave the

2762.56 --> 2767.92
line

2764.319 --> 2767.92
that's purely descriptory

2769.65 --> 2773.52
[Music]

2771.2 --> 2777.7599999999998
might also be the similar way how they

2773.52 --> 2777.7599999999998
sneak in viruses and [ __ ] too by the way

2779.2 --> 2790.72
the more dangerous ones and that is also

2788.72 --> 2794.0
by the way why i use

2790.72 --> 2797.2
i have for over 10 years spybot

2794.0 --> 2800.24
search and destroy completely

2797.2 --> 2803.9199999999996
free non-profit

2800.24 --> 2807.359
group that runs on donations for over 10

2803.92 --> 2807.359
years or longer probably

2807.76 --> 2814.2400000000002
that yeah give do specifically that they

2811.599 --> 2814.2400000000002
unrout

2814.839 --> 2819.04
cookies

2816.4 --> 2820.64
and they always keep on updating i don't

2819.04 --> 2822.96
know who's running it

2820.64 --> 2824.48
but i know that the people that are

2822.96 --> 2827.76
running it

2824.48 --> 2828.8
are like old stamp programmers from the

2827.76 --> 2832.8
old

2828.8 --> 2836.96
yeah the anarctic age as it were

2832.8 --> 2836.96
before the great corporate

2838.0 --> 2841.52
takeover as it were that were really for

2840.96 --> 2844.8
this

2841.52 --> 2846.0
ultimate free internet and [ __ ] hackers

2844.8 --> 2848.88
for freedom that kind of

2846.0 --> 2859.839
those types i think that those are like

2848.88 --> 2859.839
really maintaining it

2871.52 --> 2874.88
yeah that's but that's just pragmatic

2873.52 --> 2877.119
it's cleaning up memory

2874.88 --> 2877.119
right

2878.24 --> 2882.64
well you could even metaphorically

2881.599 --> 2886.559
compare it to

2882.64 --> 2887.2
people like if you're like a computer

2886.559 --> 2889.8390000000004
when it

2887.2 --> 2891.2
does runs a program it's basically doing

2889.839 --> 2893.599
something right

2891.2 --> 2895.52
thinking you could consider in a

2893.599 --> 2898.079
specific steered way

2895.52 --> 2898.88
processing [ __ ] or when you do stuff

2898.079 --> 2902.2400000000002
things

2898.88 --> 2904.1600000000003
go wrong correct it sometimes you don't

2902.24 --> 2906.9599999999996
see it

2904.16 --> 2906.96
and eventually

2907.28 --> 2914.2400000000002
yeah if you keep on going going you'll

2910.4 --> 2917.119
degrade in quality because the amount of

2914.24 --> 2918.4799999999996
unseen mistakes start to pile up and you

2917.119 --> 2921.28
crash

2918.48 --> 2922.079
now i'm talking about a human being here

2921.28 --> 2924.1600000000003
right

2922.079 --> 2925.44
so yeah how do you do that you

2924.16 --> 2927.359
discontinue

2925.44 --> 2928.8
you step away from what you were doing

2927.359 --> 2931.04
and like get a

2928.8 --> 2932.8
breath of fresh air maybe have a little

2931.04 --> 2935.359
talk or have some dinner

2932.8 --> 2936.1600000000003
and get your mind literally discontinue

2935.359 --> 2939.68
the process

2936.16 --> 2943.2
effectively resetting including

2939.68 --> 2945.68
wiping the temporary memory systems

2943.2 --> 2946.319
right so that's kind of the same thing a

2945.68 --> 2949.52
computer

2946.319 --> 2949.52
needs to do that too

2949.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
they need to discontinue the cycle

2954.839 --> 2971.839
sometimes

2957.839 --> 2971.839
or it's gonna just mock up

2972.96 --> 2977.359
oh by the way thank you that flat fellow

2974.72 --> 2985.839
for the 99 cent super chat donation

2977.359 --> 2985.839
almost forgot

2991.92 --> 2998.48
right yeah with computers is for dust

2995.359 --> 3000.72
i'm not too worried about dust it only

2998.48 --> 3002.48
it all really also depends on what type

3000.72 --> 3004.16
of computer setup you have

3002.48 --> 3006.64
the more heat your computer is going to

3004.16 --> 3009.839
generate the more

3006.64 --> 3011.52
risky dust pile up becomes that's

3009.839 --> 3014.72
basically how that works

3011.52 --> 3018.72
now my computer is designed to be

3014.72 --> 3021.2799999999997
so low on heat so effective fluid

3018.72 --> 3022.8799999999997
that it's just not dangerous like

3021.28 --> 3025.52
literally there is now

3022.88 --> 3026.88
no fan running in my computer and that

3025.52 --> 3029.28
can keep on going

3026.88 --> 3030.7200000000003
the entire day now during the summer

3029.28 --> 3033.0400000000004
however

3030.72 --> 3035.2799999999997
then it sometimes becomes a little

3033.04 --> 3038.8
problematic when it's warm

3035.28 --> 3040.4
and then i do then i would potentially

3038.8 --> 3042.6400000000003
turn on a fan or

3040.4 --> 3045.119
might overheat my computer it's happened

3042.64 --> 3046.5589999999997
like twice this summer

3045.119 --> 3048.2400000000002
but in the winter and all the other

3046.559 --> 3050.2400000000002
times no it's no problem at

3048.24 --> 3052.16
all because my computer just doesn't

3050.24 --> 3052.9599999999996
generate that much heat like even if i

3052.16 --> 3056.0789999999997
would play

3052.96 --> 3058.079
a pretty heavy game 3d engine high

3056.079 --> 3062.96
resolution all that

3058.079 --> 3066.8390000000004
it's not my computer's so strong

3062.96 --> 3068.88
it's like it's effectively bored

3066.839 --> 3072.24
constantly

3068.88 --> 3076.0
because it's just way over capacitized

3072.24 --> 3077.9199999999996
for what i do with it and that's good

3076.0 --> 3083.28
because then it just doesn't take too

3077.92 --> 3097.839
much energy

3083.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
and it will last much longer

3099.68 --> 3104.48
also i don't project as much stress on

3102.48 --> 3105.04
my computer because of the way it is

3104.48 --> 3107.359
designed

3105.04 --> 3110.079
i designed it i literally put this whole

3107.359 --> 3113.7599999999998
thing together from scratch

3110.079 --> 3113.76
separated parts that i bought

3116.16 --> 3121.2
and plugged it all into one myself no

3122.839 --> 3125.839
help

3128.319 --> 3131.52
oh well a little help here and there

3130.0 --> 3131.92
it's more like hey can you double check

3131.52 --> 3133.28
this

3131.92 --> 3135.839
i'm not too sure because i'm kind of

3133.28 --> 3136.8
nervous sometimes with it like oh god i

3135.839 --> 3139.359
hope i didn't

3136.8 --> 3140.96
block the wrong thing but yeah i've done

3139.359 --> 3143.04
it plenty of times now that i'm not

3140.96 --> 3144.8
really

3143.04 --> 3147.04
nervous anymore if i would have to do

3144.8 --> 3147.04
that

3147.52 --> 3151.359
but yeah i i really appreciate my

3150.4 --> 3153.6800000000003
computer

3151.359 --> 3155.04
my computer is like i really like this

3153.68 --> 3159.839
one i really

3155.04 --> 3159.839
like him her because

3160.64 --> 3167.2
it always works always it's like

3164.96 --> 3169.2
this computer has had the least amount

3167.2 --> 3171.52
of bugs

3169.2 --> 3173.1189999999997
and crashes that have experienced

3171.52 --> 3176.079
throughout my

3173.119 --> 3176.079
computer life

3177.119 --> 3181.839
and that is just awesome

3183.83 --> 3188.48
[Music]

3185.92 --> 3189.92
and yeah when you project less stress on

3188.48 --> 3191.92
your computer because if your computer

3189.92 --> 3193.119
is constantly mocking up not doing the

3191.92 --> 3196.079
thing you want

3193.119 --> 3197.92
which you know it should be doing then

3196.079 --> 3201.3590000000004
you go like

3197.92 --> 3203.599
yeah that actually does something you

3201.359 --> 3203.5989999999997
know

3204.8 --> 3209.28
you might think oh it's just an

3206.4 --> 3212.88
inanimate object no

3209.28 --> 3216.3190000000004
not really it is but it also

3212.88 --> 3220.1600000000003
isn't because there is sort of a spirit

3216.319 --> 3223.839
to it it's like a silicon

3220.16 --> 3227.44
spirit electric but it does

3223.839 --> 3231.839
respond just like living

3227.44 --> 3231.839
things in a sort of way

3233.119 --> 3237.839
if you allow that to if you're allowed

3235.76 --> 3239.28
to conceive that it is kind of the same

3237.839 --> 3242.0789999999997
similarity

3239.28 --> 3243.6800000000003
in my opinion not saying everybody

3242.079 --> 3245.28
should do this like oh you should treat

3243.68 --> 3247.5989999999997
your computer like a

3245.28 --> 3248.3190000000004
like an animal or something but it's the

3247.599 --> 3253.04
same way as

3248.319 --> 3255.44
saying like okay this is an animal

3253.04 --> 3257.2799999999997
that means it's a lesser life form i

3255.44 --> 3260.48
don't give a [ __ ] whether it dies or

3257.28 --> 3263.0400000000004
it just yeah get out of here do whatever

3260.48 --> 3265.119
or you could say wow this is an animal

3263.04 --> 3267.2
it actually has feelings it's

3265.119 --> 3268.48
it's like this this kind of social

3267.2 --> 3271.68
behavior and then you

3268.48 --> 3272.2400000000002
feel you resonate with it you get closer

3271.68 --> 3274.16
to it

3272.24 --> 3276.0
and then you realize like yeah it's

3274.16 --> 3279.1189999999997
almost like a human but

3276.0 --> 3281.52
it's indifferent in some ways

3279.119 --> 3283.28
well that's the same thing with

3281.52 --> 3285.599
computers you could just think it's just

3283.28 --> 3287.6800000000003
a stupid piece of [ __ ]

3285.599 --> 3290.319
plastic and electronics and it's all

3287.68 --> 3292.5589999999997
mind control bill gates or whatever

3290.319 --> 3294.5589999999997
yeah that's not a very nice projection

3292.559 --> 3297.3590000000004
you're projecting on your device you're

3294.559 --> 3299.3590000000004
utilizing when that happens

3297.359 --> 3301.52
can't even begin to say what it would be

3299.359 --> 3307.44
like with a phone

3301.52 --> 3311.359
internet phone but if you just

3307.44 --> 3314.64
regard it as some

3311.359 --> 3318.72
yeah a thing that's just there

3314.64 --> 3321.839
for you like a pet almost like a

3318.72 --> 3323.2799999999997
yeah like a nice dog yeah you have to

3321.839 --> 3325.44
feed it yeah you have to let it out but

3323.28 --> 3326.0
it can also guard your house and it can

3325.44 --> 3328.7200000000003
also

3326.0 --> 3329.52
provide consolidation like when you're

3328.72 --> 3331.04
sad and

3329.52 --> 3335.839
all this see well if you treat your

3331.04 --> 3340.079
computer kind of like that

3335.839 --> 3342.5589999999997
works a lot better does for me

3340.079 --> 3343.76
just like respect your computer don't

3342.559 --> 3349.52
use it like a

3343.76 --> 3353.92
an inanimate cursing pole or something

3349.52 --> 3353.92
when it breaks computer can't help it

3358.48 --> 3363.52
right george sanford yeah i'm not gonna

3362.72 --> 3367.04
give you

3363.52 --> 3369.839
the i'm not gonna give you the technical

3367.04 --> 3372.0
specs of my computer i'm not gonna

3369.839 --> 3374.0
throw that out here on youtube if you

3372.0 --> 3377.44
don't mind

3374.0 --> 3380.72
not that i know it like

3377.44 --> 3384.64
on the top of my mind but i'm not gonna

3380.72 --> 3384.64
give out yeah

3385.2 --> 3391.4399999999996
details like that it's nobody's freaking

3388.839 --> 3396.96
business

3391.44 --> 3396.96
but it's good enough it is a quad core

3398.64 --> 3401.44
and it rocks

3402.72 --> 3419.839
and it runs on 64 bits

3422.0 --> 3433.839
all right

3446.59 --> 3449.7090000000003
[Music]

3454.88 --> 3461.839
all right computers computers we now

3457.44 --> 3461.839
we're talking about computers

3473.68 --> 3477.359
my little laptop is embarrassed

3478.24 --> 3480.8799999999997
good chat

3482.559 --> 3486.079
little laptops can be awesome

3486.16 --> 3490.3999999999996
if they're not trying to be over

3487.68 --> 3492.16
achievers and constantly overheat

3490.4 --> 3503.839
because that is the typical problem with

3492.16 --> 3503.839
laptops they overheat

3505.119 --> 3508.88
earth passenger how the hell should i

3507.359 --> 3513.2
know

3508.88 --> 3514.799
it look i there's professional reviewers

3513.2 --> 3518.319
for that sort of thing

3514.799 --> 3521.2
if i'm picking out a computer parts i'm

3518.319 --> 3521.68
no way website will i where i will go

3521.2 --> 3524.799
where they

3521.68 --> 3524.799
literally have like

3524.96 --> 3530.64
monthly reviews on

3528.0 --> 3533.599
every freaking new piece of computer

3530.64 --> 3536.72
technology that's coming out

3533.599 --> 3540.0
the cross testing and [ __ ] is just

3536.72 --> 3544.0789999999997
extensive and that's also

3540.0 --> 3546.48
the source that i used to basically

3544.079 --> 3547.8390000000004
get together my computer based on a very

3546.48 --> 3550.4
widely tested

3547.839 --> 3550.88
model that people have done and then

3550.4 --> 3553.52
they

3550.88 --> 3554.079
like the website itself promoted it

3553.52 --> 3558.079
what's it

3554.079 --> 3562.96
called again

3558.079 --> 3562.96
i think it's a dutch site

3563.119 --> 3573.839
hold on let me find it where is it

3576.559 --> 3582.1600000000003
yeah tweakers that's right tweakers.net

3583.839 --> 3587.839
very familiar with that site

3590.079 --> 3594.48
and yeah the price watch section is it

3592.72 --> 3598.64
is famed like this

3594.48 --> 3601.23
website has gotten like internet prices

3598.64 --> 3604.42
for their website so

3601.23 --> 3604.42
[Music]

3607.76 --> 3618.1600000000003
let me double check this

3615.359 --> 3620.5589999999997
i don't know they might also have a iaea

3618.16 --> 3625.2
they have other languages i think

3620.559 --> 3627.52
wait i just showed it so it's such an

3625.2 --> 3630.16
extensive site

3627.52 --> 3633.839
anyway that's that's what i use they've

3630.16 --> 3633.839
been great i've been using them for

3636.88 --> 3643.839
i first started using them in 2006 i've

3639.68 --> 3643.839
been using that as a source for over 14

3654.839 --> 3657.839
years

3660.37 --> 3666.899
[Music]

3669.52 --> 3673.68
man i haven't looked around what's even

3671.599 --> 3676.2400000000002
out there for some time

3673.68 --> 3679.2
last time i watched i was like oh bigger

3676.24 --> 3679.2
monitors

3679.44 --> 3684.2400000000002
i want a bigger monitor i wanted

3684.72 --> 3692.9599999999996
yeah a 2560 by

3687.92 --> 3692.96
40 40 type of monitor

3693.44 --> 3697.359
seem to become a little cheaper now yeah

3695.76 --> 3700.0
those things like all these things

3697.359 --> 3701.68
like decrease in price dramatically

3700.0 --> 3702.799
until it's no longer available and the

3701.68 --> 3706.16
latest version is

3702.799 --> 3708.319
kind of as expensive the other was

3706.16 --> 3710.5589999999997
the drop-off was in the beginning like

3708.319 --> 3710.5589999999997
that

3711.04 --> 3715.68
so i'm never i'm always looking like oh

3713.76 --> 3717.44
oh i want it i want it and then thinking

3715.68 --> 3720.8799999999997
yeah in two years

3717.44 --> 3720.88
let's see if i still want it

3722.559 --> 3726.799
all right but hey if you need it you

3725.839 --> 3729.839
need it

3726.799 --> 3731.7599999999998
and when you gotta get it then yeah it's

3729.839 --> 3733.599
best to just get something that you know

3731.76 --> 3734.4
that despite it's gonna be outdated or

3733.599 --> 3736.96
whatever

3734.4 --> 3741.839
you will like to be using it for a very

3736.96 --> 3741.839
long time

3745.92 --> 3750.16
that was the best programming language

3752.08 --> 3756.96
[Music]

3753.52 --> 3760.96
i hope you're not asking me the guy

3756.96 --> 3764.559
that of all things does

3760.96 --> 3767.44
not know how to program

3764.559 --> 3768.2400000000002
i know how it works i've seen people do

3767.44 --> 3771.28
it

3768.24 --> 3774.3999999999996
i get even like the tip

3771.28 --> 3776.799
yeah i i think i know more about

3774.4 --> 3777.839
i could more meta talk about programming

3776.799 --> 3783.839
than i could ever

3777.839 --> 3783.839
actually program

3784.64 --> 3789.2
the last time i've actually tried to

3786.48 --> 3792.2400000000002
program was on my commodore 64 with

3789.2 --> 3792.799
basic now i did quite some [ __ ] with

3792.24 --> 3796.16
that

3792.799 --> 3796.799
completely silly useless stuff like

3796.16 --> 3799.839
ascii

3796.799 --> 3800.72
animations it's like i started my movie

3799.839 --> 3805.44
career

3800.72 --> 3808.0789999999997
making ascii animations to amuse myself

3805.44 --> 3810.64
with my wish list for fireworks that i

3808.079 --> 3815.599
would want to buy in the like

3810.64 --> 3815.5989999999997
in the next year that sort of [ __ ]

3816.0 --> 3821.92
like really silly kid [ __ ] but i would

3819.359 --> 3823.92
do that

3821.92 --> 3825.92
because i would be looking forward to

3823.92 --> 3828.079
that so much

3825.92 --> 3830.2400000000002
my god there was nothing more awesome

3828.079 --> 3832.559
than firework i even liked fireworks

3830.24 --> 3839.839
better than i liked computers

3832.559 --> 3839.8390000000004
as a as a kid

3849.839 --> 3854.86
is adding your own music to age of

3852.0 --> 3857.2
empires programming

3854.86 --> 3861.359
[Music]

3857.2 --> 3864.319
not really sounds more just like

3861.359 --> 3865.359
minor hacking it's just detail [ __ ] you

3864.319 --> 3868.16
know

3865.359 --> 3870.0
you can literally do that if you want to

3868.16 --> 3871.92
with certain programs

3870.0 --> 3874.079
certain games even you can just like

3871.92 --> 3876.559
okay find the sound file oh

3874.079 --> 3878.1600000000003
this song well i'm going to interchange

3876.559 --> 3880.4
that with that song now

3878.16 --> 3883.2799999999997
yeah you can do that if you know if you

3880.4 --> 3883.28
have the patience

3883.599 --> 3887.76
and sometimes it doesn't work and then

3885.359 --> 3889.7599999999998
screws up the program have to basically

3887.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
uninstall or reinstall it again

3889.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
it's only one way to find out

3901.73 --> 3906.319
[Music]

3903.28 --> 3908.3190000000004
the issue though is with me if a game

3906.319 --> 3911.2
has bad music

3908.319 --> 3911.599
that doesn't really matter how beautiful

3911.2 --> 3915.1189999999997
it is

3911.599 --> 3918.0
it absolutely breaks the game for me

3915.119 --> 3920.799
and that's why games that i guess in the

3918.0 --> 3922.64
face of the visual developments are not

3920.799 --> 3926.319
that spectacular

3922.64 --> 3929.0389999999998
that have amazing music are almost like

3926.319 --> 3932.24
immortal to me

3929.039 --> 3934.4
like baldur's gate games

3932.24 --> 3936.0789999999997
it's like after every time because of

3934.4 --> 3938.7200000000003
the music it is the music

3936.079 --> 3940.559
sometimes i'll just listen to the music

3938.72 --> 3944.24
and sometimes i play the game

3940.559 --> 3946.48
and listen to the music but i also

3944.24 --> 3948.64
let the game determine where the music

3946.48 --> 3949.28
goes because it has again i explained

3948.64 --> 3952.0789999999997
this

3949.28 --> 3953.92
very distinct pattern build up of the

3952.079 --> 3957.039
music that is really

3953.92 --> 3960.48
story bound in ways it really

3957.039 --> 3963.039
expresses the character

3960.48 --> 3966.319
of what's going on and that makes it so

3963.039 --> 3970.96
amazing like an interactive book

3966.319 --> 3970.96
really interactive like that

3977.44 --> 3982.4
right and also by the way that's what

3980.0 --> 3985.839
made some commodore 64 games just

3982.4 --> 3989.599
freaking amazing it's such

3985.839 --> 3991.0389999999998
compelling songs even with just basic

3989.599 --> 3993.6800000000003
sound effects

3991.039 --> 3995.599
because yeah people that made songs like

3993.68 --> 3997.7599999999998
on commodore 64 they had very little to

3995.599 --> 4002.1600000000003
work with so they had to make it good

3997.76 --> 4005.44
they had to like bypass the

4002.16 --> 4009.52
yeah the sound issues that the quality

4005.44 --> 4012.64
like that is good yeah it could be

4009.52 --> 4013.44
perceived as kind of goofy but yeah

4012.64 --> 4015.359
there's some

4013.44 --> 4017.52
songs they managed to make with this

4015.359 --> 4020.88
that were like

4017.52 --> 4023.7599999999998
just unbelievable

4020.88 --> 4023.76
something new

4026.88 --> 4033.52
like games like cybernoid that an

4030.359 --> 4034.0789999999997
amazing soundtrack so good that i

4033.52 --> 4037.44
actually

4034.079 --> 4040.0
tape recorded it and listen to that [ __ ]

4037.44 --> 4041.52
i act and it's been a while i'm not

4040.0 --> 4043.52
gonna do that again but i

4041.52 --> 4044.96
i like this song i was so impressed by

4043.52 --> 4046.64
the song which is like a

4044.96 --> 4048.48
amalgamation of all kinds of things it

4046.64 --> 4049.68
has so many different melodies in that

4048.48 --> 4053.2
one singular song

4049.68 --> 4055.0389999999998
so many it's like 10 different melodies

4053.2 --> 4059.0389999999998
in one song

4055.039 --> 4059.599
subsequently that i learned that song by

4059.039 --> 4062.4
heart

4059.599 --> 4064.2400000000002
i even had a silly gimmick at some point

4062.4 --> 4067.76
it's just too silly

4064.24 --> 4071.68
very little kid right say

4067.76 --> 4074.2400000000002
six seven eight is that still little i

4071.68 --> 4079.7599999999998
was little enough

4074.24 --> 4079.7599999999998
but yeah and what's another game uh

4082.64 --> 4087.68
arkanoid holy [ __ ] man i don't know if

4085.76 --> 4091.039
it was number one or number two

4087.68 --> 4093.52
but that song is kind of basic but it's

4091.039 --> 4095.76
like super impressive

4093.52 --> 4097.2789999999995
and there's more of just those types of

4095.76 --> 4099.679
games that

4097.279 --> 4100.96
are just games they're like oh it's just

4099.679 --> 4102.96
like an arcade game but

4100.96 --> 4104.64
for some reason they had just this

4102.96 --> 4106.88
amazing music

4104.64 --> 4107.679
that just really impressed people it

4106.88 --> 4111.52
also

4107.679 --> 4114.96
probably inspired electronic music

4111.52 --> 4114.96
revolution and led to

4115.279 --> 4122.080000000001
just things like jungle and goat trans

4119.279 --> 4124.400000000001
maybe i think sometimes or it it

4122.08 --> 4125.44
it bordered it somehow it is like

4124.4 --> 4128.08
electronic

4125.44 --> 4130.159
but that always yeah it's always been

4128.08 --> 4133.839
the music

4130.159 --> 4133.839
music that did it for me

4145.44 --> 4150.719
then talk yeah mostly commodore 64 right

4148.159 --> 4153.759
because i did not witness

4150.719 --> 4156.319
the early pc game era

4153.759 --> 4158.48
i completely bypassed on it i hated it

4156.319 --> 4161.04
because i thought it was stupid and ugly

4158.48 --> 4162.08
most of it is like really freaking ugly

4161.04 --> 4165.2789999999995
compared

4162.08 --> 4168.239
to the amiga games that were out

4165.279 --> 4169.359
right then that were literally

4168.239 --> 4174.799
simulating

4169.359 --> 4178.0
3d flight using amazing sprites

4174.799 --> 4178.88
of actual 3d rendered images that would

4178.0 --> 4182.0
be like

4178.88 --> 4186.839
flying in 3d tunnels

4182.0 --> 4190.159
like actual 3d in the early 90s

4186.839 --> 4193.5199999999995
okay well the pc was like

4190.159 --> 4197.199
stupid freaking block graphic shits like

4193.52 --> 4200.64
embarrassing as [ __ ] amiga

4197.199 --> 4203.678999999999
had amazing games

4200.64 --> 4206.2390000000005
mind blowing and the music my god the

4203.679 --> 4206.2390000000005
music

4208.48 --> 4211.5199999999995
not all of it was good but there were

4210.0 --> 4214.56
just some games that are just

4211.52 --> 4217.120000000001
amazing electronic soundtracks

4214.56 --> 4218.719
because of they had the amiga had just

4217.12 --> 4221.5199999999995
sound quality available that's just

4218.719 --> 4221.52
unbelievable

4221.679 --> 4226.96
the demo scene oh yes well stone monkey

4225.44 --> 4231.199
3d

4226.96 --> 4235.12
uh i've never bought

4231.199 --> 4239.199
a commodore or amiga game what i did

4235.12 --> 4241.4
my brother too is go to conventions

4239.199 --> 4244.4
or everybody would bring their commodore

4241.4 --> 4244.4
64's

4245.84 --> 4250.0
and their amiga 600s and 1200s and all

4248.88 --> 4253.1990000000005
of that

4250.0 --> 4255.28
in a giant room full of stinky nerds

4253.199 --> 4256.48
playing computer games for hours and

4255.28 --> 4259.12
hours and hours to be like

4256.48 --> 4260.32
oh my god this is such a cool game can i

4259.12 --> 4262.5599999999995
copy it

4260.32 --> 4264.88
only if you have that game because i

4262.56 --> 4265.84
want it can i copy that yeah let's copy

4264.88 --> 4268.0
this

4265.84 --> 4269.28
and eventually was even as crazy as like

4268.0 --> 4272.4
okay i'm

4269.28 --> 4273.12
i'm doing away my my games i i i have to

4272.4 --> 4276.799999999999
get a lie

4273.12 --> 4280.08
this happened nerds like

4276.8 --> 4283.04
i have to i have to put my computer away

4280.08 --> 4284.08
i can't do it anymore i'm too addicted

4283.04 --> 4286.719
let's get you

4284.08 --> 4288.08
like i'm selling all my games and then

4286.719 --> 4291.28
you were thinking like

4288.08 --> 4294.239
floppy disks with like up to 10

4291.28 --> 4296.4
games would be minor games or pretty

4294.239 --> 4297.44
extensive games like on one or two or

4296.4 --> 4300.879999999999
three floppy disks

4297.44 --> 4303.199
and they would have like buckets with

4300.88 --> 4304.2390000000005
hundreds of floppy disks it'd be like

4303.199 --> 4307.759999999999
okay

4304.239 --> 4310.879999999999
buy it for a hundred euros i have 100

4307.76 --> 4310.88
gilders back then

4311.76 --> 4316.0
and holy [ __ ] like that way i had at

4314.8 --> 4319.679
some point like

4316.0 --> 4322.4
i was literally spending a year

4319.679 --> 4324.56
trying to figure out every single game

4322.4 --> 4326.239
that i bought in one of those batches or

4324.56 --> 4328.8
like my brother gave it to me at some

4326.239 --> 4330.639999999999
point like here i don't want to figure

4328.8 --> 4331.679
out what's on this you do it and i was

4330.64 --> 4336.159000000001
like

4331.679 --> 4339.28
oh my god a mystery chest of games

4336.159 --> 4341.5199999999995
those were the days guys a mystery chest

4339.28 --> 4343.759999999999
again

4341.52 --> 4345.040000000001
but yeah samson they were definitely

4343.76 --> 4348.400000000001
stinky nerds

4345.04 --> 4352.48
absolutely you know

4348.4 --> 4352.48
nerds were really nerds back then

4355.76 --> 4360.159000000001
we prefer intellectual badasses

4362.0 --> 4367.92
dude i was a nerd myself man

4365.44 --> 4367.919999999999
terrible

4368.56 --> 4374.88
and i stank i reeked with fear

4371.679 --> 4377.1990000000005
social anxiety so yeah

4374.88 --> 4379.84
i i only say this now because i'm kind

4377.199 --> 4379.839999999999
of over that

4382.84 --> 4385.84
mostly

4394.159 --> 4398.239
was mark sargen a video game champion i

4396.8 --> 4401.679
don't know

4398.239 --> 4404.32
might be dude i was just

4401.679 --> 4404.719
into the nerd scene i don't i've never

4404.32 --> 4407.759999999999
been

4404.719 --> 4410.4800000000005
like oh we're the top gamer

4407.76 --> 4412.400000000001
on stage on video and you have to be

4410.48 --> 4415.199
very cool and you have to have your

4412.4 --> 4420.5599999999995
thing in your special hat and

4415.199 --> 4423.599999999999
that stuff is just like oh come on man

4420.56 --> 4425.4400000000005
come on that's not interesting

4423.6 --> 4427.120000000001
i don't find that interesting i don't

4425.44 --> 4427.919999999999
know maybe some people do you know maybe

4427.12 --> 4429.84
there's some

4427.92 --> 4433.36
chicks that find it all very hot or

4429.84 --> 4436.159000000001
something i don't know man

4433.36 --> 4437.679
i'm just about giant treasure chest full

4436.159 --> 4440.799999999999
of mysterious unknown

4437.679 --> 4442.0
video games that was my thing it's like

4440.8 --> 4444.96
whoa what is this

4442.0 --> 4447.6
the potential what did they manage to

4444.96 --> 4447.6
put together

4450.0 --> 4454.719
you know it's it's still too much to

4452.4 --> 4458.32
this day blows my mind that

4454.719 --> 4459.76
officially the commodore 64 had a

4458.32 --> 4463.12
maximum capacity

4459.76 --> 4466.0
of 16 sprites

4463.12 --> 4468.32
a special visual programming trick that

4466.0 --> 4469.679
they devised to have moving characters

4468.32 --> 4473.44
which was unique

4469.679 --> 4475.4400000000005
like that right it was a unique system

4473.44 --> 4477.919999999999
before that there was only

4475.44 --> 4479.44
literally characters well sprite was

4477.92 --> 4481.6
different because a sprite could

4479.44 --> 4484.678999999999
literally like a dual layer

4481.6 --> 4486.2390000000005
it was almost like digital

4484.679 --> 4488.08
cinematography tricks

4486.239 --> 4489.759999999999
that was what the sprite was it's like a

4488.08 --> 4493.5199999999995
separate it's very

4489.76 --> 4495.12
hard to explain as a non-programmer

4493.52 --> 4496.56
but they utilized it and then it

4495.12 --> 4497.92
predicted like okay the computer can

4496.56 --> 4500.8
handle 16 stride

4497.92 --> 4504.2390000000005
oh guess what it's like official video

4500.8 --> 4507.6
games from the later commodore 64 rs

4504.239 --> 4511.28
that had over 64 sprites

4507.6 --> 4514.56
at the same time screen moving around

4511.28 --> 4516.8
now that did give some problems slowed

4514.56 --> 4517.4400000000005
it down but it was possible they made it

4516.8 --> 4520.64
possible

4517.44 --> 4521.599999999999
how about that man it's like no this

4520.64 --> 4524.2390000000005
computer can do

4521.6 --> 4526.64
more than it's supposed to now that is

4524.239 --> 4526.639999999999
awesome

4527.52 --> 4532.400000000001
no i never played missed missed as a pc

4530.08 --> 4532.4
game

4534.96 --> 4541.679
i didn't play any video games in the 90s

4538.0 --> 4545.76
from the pc bar just a couple

4541.679 --> 4550.159
like dark omen which was like

4545.76 --> 4550.159000000001
yeah sort of a strategy game

4550.84 --> 4553.84
and

4554.32 --> 4560.0
doom 2 but to be

4557.52 --> 4560.64
fair i first played it on my amiga 1200

4560.0 --> 4562.88
which when

4560.64 --> 4564.84
ran much better and the music was much

4562.88 --> 4567.52
more awesome

4564.84 --> 4571.12
uh

4567.52 --> 4571.120000000001
what else did i typically play

4574.08 --> 4579.5199999999995
it's a long time ago

4577.28 --> 4580.96
now from the pc it was just things like

4579.52 --> 4583.040000000001
baldur's gate

4580.96 --> 4585.92
that was really it that baldur's gate

4583.04 --> 4589.44
was the thing that really said okay

4585.92 --> 4594.2390000000005
okay okay pc is one pretty much

4589.44 --> 4596.639999999999
like there's no way like

4594.239 --> 4598.5599999999995
nintendo nes was cool yeah i also did

4596.64 --> 4602.56
that

4598.56 --> 4602.56
i kind of transited from

4603.679 --> 4610.56
from my amiga kind of to the to the nes

4607.36 --> 4610.5599999999995
and the super nes

4612.4 --> 4616.0
because there were some pretty awesome

4613.92 --> 4620.64
games and day two like this as

4616.0 --> 4620.64
the super nes also

4620.8 --> 4627.52
started to utilize the tricks that

4624.56 --> 4628.719
amiga gamer games had like donkey kong

4627.52 --> 4631.84
country for example

4628.719 --> 4635.04
donkey kong country had 3d

4631.84 --> 4635.04
rendered graphics

4635.12 --> 4642.5599999999995
that were just used as sprites brilliant

4638.64 --> 4647.12
was very beautiful was perfected so much

4642.56 --> 4647.120000000001
3d work on a pretty good level for the

4648.84 --> 4653.360000000001
time

4651.12 --> 4654.64
yeah i was just very impressed with that

4653.36 --> 4656.639999999999
also

4654.64 --> 4657.84
and i and i kind of liked the mario

4656.64 --> 4661.76
thing i really did

4657.84 --> 4664.88
i really appreciated the mario stuff

4661.76 --> 4666.8
it's a mario i like it

4664.88 --> 4670.400000000001
come on dude who doesn't want to be a

4666.8 --> 4674.320000000001
freaking plumber eating mushrooms and

4670.4 --> 4674.32
like flying around with

4674.56 --> 4679.84
with raccoon tails and [ __ ] come on

4680.4 --> 4685.199
like he eats the mushroom so i don't

4682.8 --> 4685.1990000000005
have to

4687.12 --> 4694.5599999999995
frocker yeah frogger is a very old

4690.4 --> 4694.5599999999995
i had frogger on my commodore 64.

4696.32 --> 4700.5599999999995
no no donkey kong country wasn't 3d

4698.96 --> 4703.84
that's right but it was

4700.56 --> 4706.88
a hundred percent 3d

4703.84 --> 4710.400000000001
generated images it was

4706.88 --> 4712.08
completely 3d sculpted and at that time

4710.4 --> 4714.32
that was not normal before that

4712.08 --> 4719.04
everything was freaking hand drawn

4714.32 --> 4719.04
everything was hand drawn everything

4719.84 --> 4727.28
except for the amiga that did it like

4724.08 --> 4728.96
five or ten years before that

4727.28 --> 4731.679
i don't know when did donkey kong

4728.96 --> 4731.679
country come out

4732.64 --> 4735.84
check that

4744.159 --> 4753.199
oh damn that's pretty early 94.

4749.28 --> 4753.199
that's earlier than i thought okay let's

4754.41 --> 4759.699
[Music]

4760.84 --> 4763.84
see

4764.32 --> 4766.639999999999
what

4770.159 --> 4780.0
okay what the hell

4776.56 --> 4780.88
i i did not know this but apparently the

4780.0 --> 4782.8
game

4780.88 --> 4784.96
that i think is pretty awesome from the

4782.8 --> 4788.2390000000005
amiga 1200

4784.96 --> 4792.32
oh wait no this is ah

4788.239 --> 4792.32
you bastard misinformed me

4795.52 --> 4802.84
no wait this is confusing

4800.48 --> 4805.12
yeah they came out in the same year how

4802.84 --> 4808.32
bizarre super stardust

4805.12 --> 4810.5599999999995
on the amiga 1200 which is just really

4808.32 --> 4812.719
awesome graphics for the time being

4810.56 --> 4818.4800000000005
and donkey kong country came out in the

4812.719 --> 4833.84
same year what the [ __ ]

4818.48 --> 4833.839999999999
i didn't know that

4848.4 --> 4854.48
oh wow superstars was

4854.8 --> 4860.4800000000005
ranked 26th best game of all time by

4857.92 --> 4862.159
amiga power the magazine

4860.48 --> 4864.638999999999
i didn't even know though oh yeah i did

4862.159 --> 4867.839999999999
know yeah i remember i remember how it

4864.639 --> 4869.84
was absolutely emotionally crushed

4867.84 --> 4871.84
when they announced that amiga would

4869.84 --> 4875.360000000001
discontinue now i remember

4871.84 --> 4879.4400000000005
i just

4875.36 --> 4879.44
those things you don't want to remember

4882.8 --> 4887.4400000000005
why didn't i pursue a career in video

4885.6 --> 4890.56
game design

4887.44 --> 4894.799999999999
i did and then i was utterly

4890.56 --> 4899.679
rejected earth passenger utterly utterly

4894.8 --> 4902.719
rejected by the rest of the world

4899.679 --> 4905.6
i have entire books

4902.719 --> 4907.04
full of blueprints of completely worked

4905.6 --> 4909.84
out programmable

4907.04 --> 4911.6
video games that are kind of like 20

4909.84 --> 4913.92
years out of date

4911.6 --> 4915.360000000001
that i literally presented like i want

4913.92 --> 4920.08
to do this

4915.36 --> 4920.08
and they just said no

4920.48 --> 4923.599999999999
we don't need you

4925.84 --> 4930.8
like we have other plans we need people

4929.04 --> 4933.6
that are completely

4930.8 --> 4935.28
programmable from scratch because we

4933.6 --> 4938.88
want you to promote

4935.28 --> 4940.32
[ __ ] up [ __ ] i didn't say it like that

4938.88 --> 4941.36
but that's what i figured out in

4940.32 --> 4945.84
retrospect

4941.36 --> 4945.839999999999
what really happened

4970.84 --> 4975.92
hmm

4972.159 --> 4975.92
let's see if i can still find the right

4984.84 --> 4991.28
one

4987.679 --> 4992.56
oh my god i almost forgot i had even

4991.28 --> 4995.599999999999
devised

4992.56 --> 4997.360000000001
a mario world 3 before they completely

4995.6 --> 4999.679
screwed that up

4997.36 --> 5001.599999999999
because i tried to make a new version of

4999.679 --> 5003.28
that and of course it wasn't going to be

5001.6 --> 5006.56
used i knew that

5003.28 --> 5010.159
where i basically like tried to upgrade

5006.56 --> 5013.360000000001
between like a version that would be

5010.159 --> 5016.4
super dynamic world buildable

5013.36 --> 5019.28
like very insanely dynamic

5016.4 --> 5020.799999999999
but consistent so that it would be sort

5019.28 --> 5023.84
of a crossover between

5020.8 --> 5029.84
mario brothers 2

5023.84 --> 5029.84
and mario world

5030.08 --> 5036.4
seriously guys i have i have it

5033.679 --> 5038.56
i still have the drawings but anyway

5036.4 --> 5040.879999999999
this was my most serious project it's

5038.56 --> 5043.84
called super bowl the dash

5040.88 --> 5045.12
this is complete this is literally

5043.84 --> 5048.4800000000005
complete

5045.12 --> 5050.639
this can be programmed right now

5048.48 --> 5052.638999999999
into a full game all that would be

5050.639 --> 5054.4800000000005
needed is some graphics

5052.639 --> 5057.36
that i already know what it should be

5054.48 --> 5059.28
like and then it's a fully programmable

5057.36 --> 5061.28
world buildable game almost like

5059.28 --> 5064.4
minecraft but

5061.28 --> 5066.88
2d that's the difference it's based on

5064.4 --> 5069.92
the 2d grid

5066.88 --> 5072.4800000000005
like just made everything everything

5069.92 --> 5072.4800000000005
about this

5075.04 --> 5080.239
based on the very old-fashioned bulgar

5077.52 --> 5080.2390000000005
dash game

5080.719 --> 5088.8
and they got just a giant giant lists

5085.28 --> 5090.0
of like cross effects like what happens

5088.8 --> 5091.360000000001
with this and that

5090.0 --> 5093.12
what happens with this and that what

5091.36 --> 5096.32
happens with this and that giant

5093.12 --> 5098.32
giant tables of data

5096.32 --> 5099.84
how everything works oh everything

5098.32 --> 5101.36
thought out

5099.84 --> 5103.360000000001
start your own company yeah that's

5101.36 --> 5106.159
really great you know what

5103.36 --> 5109.759999999999
i'd love to do that i need a couple of

5106.159 --> 5112.638999999999
thousand euros for that though at least

5109.76 --> 5114.639
to spend extra that i will not be able

5112.639 --> 5117.679
to yield anything else from

5114.639 --> 5118.159000000001
in between all that time so yeah sure

5117.679 --> 5120.0
you know

5118.159 --> 5122.48
if i got infinite money i can do

5120.0 --> 5122.48
everything

5123.6 --> 5128.08
it's really cool it doesn't really have

5125.84 --> 5129.6
priority oh yeah i almost forgot i made

5128.08 --> 5134.719
an entire

5129.6 --> 5134.719
space colonization game

5136.8 --> 5144.56
like 3d based models for buildings

5140.639 --> 5148.400000000001
industrial space buildings

5144.56 --> 5151.4400000000005
for like sort of a space sim city

5148.4 --> 5153.759999999999
type thing literally

5151.44 --> 5155.12
it's all these freaking i showed this

5153.76 --> 5159.360000000001
everything spaceships

5155.12 --> 5162.0
i literally 3d render that in imagine 3d

5159.36 --> 5164.799999999999
giant bazaar like structures towers

5162.0 --> 5167.28
everything utilizable

5164.8 --> 5169.84
it's just 3d model designs it's not

5167.28 --> 5169.84
spectacular

5170.239 --> 5177.839999999999
but i didn't make it i made it all

5173.6 --> 5179.4400000000005
look the solar system a solar system i

5177.84 --> 5182.159000000001
made a solar system isn't that

5179.44 --> 5182.159
interesting we

5184.56 --> 5187.280000000001
could you see that

5188.639 --> 5197.84
a solar system yeah

5192.08 --> 5197.84
you can't have space

5198.159 --> 5202.719
sim city without a solar system of

5200.48 --> 5202.718999999999
course

5205.12 --> 5208.639
get investors to share the vision this

5207.199 --> 5211.599999999999
is all crap man

5208.639 --> 5213.36
this is all literally 20 years outdated

5211.6 --> 5215.679
game development

5213.36 --> 5217.04
this particular part though not the bull

5215.679 --> 5219.1990000000005
the dash that's still

5217.04 --> 5221.44
it's a mini game it's like one of those

5219.199 --> 5225.12
mini games

5221.44 --> 5227.599999999999
properly built could probably

5225.12 --> 5229.92
manifest could it be installed

5227.6 --> 5233.280000000001
potentially like a game that would be

5229.92 --> 5235.679
no more than 100 megabytes and it would

5233.28 --> 5235.679
still be

5236.84 --> 5240.719
amazing it's

5238.48 --> 5242.08
the super bowl dash game is literally

5240.719 --> 5244.4800000000005
like a puzzle game

5242.08 --> 5246.239
that can be any type of puzzle game you

5244.48 --> 5249.44
can even

5246.239 --> 5253.44
basically play team arena

5249.44 --> 5256.96
in the system if you want

5253.44 --> 5259.678999999999
if you want the game level to be

5256.96 --> 5259.679
like that it's

5264.96 --> 5267.84
this

5269.12 --> 5284.239
oh my god oh my god

5280.719 --> 5284.2390000000005
i can't believe i have this

5284.32 --> 5289.84
i can't believe i have this this is the

5286.48 --> 5292.799999999999
first novel i ever wrote

5289.84 --> 5292.8
when i was 10

5293.12 --> 5295.92
no 12.

5297.52 --> 5300.96
about time travel i can't believe i

5300.4 --> 5303.599999999999
still

5300.96 --> 5303.6
have this

5305.52 --> 5312.56
oh my god

5309.04 --> 5312.56
i i even got a map

5316.32 --> 5323.199
wow oh my god i gotta read this

5320.8 --> 5324.96
it's only 23 pages long though and then

5323.199 --> 5330.799999999999
i discontinued but still

5324.96 --> 5330.8
holy [ __ ] i didn't know i still had this

5331.76 --> 5342.0
that's incredible

5337.679 --> 5345.52
let's see what else i got oh

5342.0 --> 5345.52
rpg map generator

5346.239 --> 5353.919999999999
this is a failed project though

5349.679 --> 5355.04
but i still got interesting stuff out of

5353.92 --> 5359.36
it

5355.04 --> 5362.0
i tried to create a automated

5359.36 --> 5362.799999999999
world map generator based on a square

5362.0 --> 5365.92
grid

5362.8 --> 5367.92
like how does land naturally develop now

5365.92 --> 5369.36
this is of course from a sort of atheist

5367.92 --> 5371.1990000000005
perspective

5369.36 --> 5372.719
the funny thing in retrospect can be

5371.199 --> 5374.159
adapted to a more creationist

5372.719 --> 5375.28
perspective as well it doesn't really

5374.159 --> 5377.599999999999
matter

5375.28 --> 5379.599999999999
but it is basically like a land

5377.6 --> 5383.1990000000005
generator like how

5379.6 --> 5383.679
does land work how does river erode the

5383.199 --> 5387.919999999999
place

5383.679 --> 5390.719
how does the landscape change

5387.92 --> 5390.719
as yeah

5391.6 --> 5395.679
from a logical development person's

5393.76 --> 5399.6
perspective members only live

5395.679 --> 5399.6
reading what no

5401.01 --> 5405.84
[Applause]

5402.96 --> 5406.4800000000005
because i did things like this like area

5405.84 --> 5409.92
forming

5406.48 --> 5412.08
table giant grid of

5409.92 --> 5413.84
what things come in a cross reference

5412.08 --> 5415.92
between water level

5413.84 --> 5418.159000000001
like amount of water humidity and

5415.92 --> 5421.6
temperature and this is the table of

5418.159 --> 5425.04
what can possibly roll out like that

5421.6 --> 5435.8
as landscape types it's fascinating how

5425.04 --> 5438.32
i built this thing

5435.8 --> 5443.04
[Music]

5438.32 --> 5445.5199999999995
this is all 90 stuff it's so old

5443.04 --> 5446.08
i can't believe how extensive how much

5445.52 --> 5448.56
time i

5446.08 --> 5449.92
put in this [ __ ] but it was all

5448.56 --> 5453.52
experimental

5449.92 --> 5456.4
because i i did not know what the [ __ ]

5453.52 --> 5456.400000000001
to do with all this

5456.54 --> 5459.659
[Music]

5464.0 --> 5468.96
i got some drawings too by the way that

5466.08 --> 5477.84
might be interesting to show

5468.96 --> 5477.84
damn this thing is way too full

5477.98 --> 5491.199
[Music]

5481.52 --> 5494.320000000001
come on

5491.199 --> 5495.44
i actually painted some of these yeah it

5494.32 --> 5497.84
literally did

5495.44 --> 5499.839999999999
this is ground works for paintings that

5497.84 --> 5504.8
i made

5499.84 --> 5519.84
that's interesting

5504.8 --> 5519.84
the shrine of the cards

5521.84 --> 5526.4800000000005
all right things like this a giant

5524.239 --> 5529.839999999999
portal

5526.48 --> 5533.839999999999
as in like really giant as big as a

5529.84 --> 5533.84
giant flat apartment

5534.88 --> 5540.32
it's not really yeah you can barely see

5538.159 --> 5547.44
[ __ ] sorry guys

5540.32 --> 5549.04
me and my pencil drawings

5547.44 --> 5551.12
and anyway this is also during the

5549.04 --> 5553.44
period when i was just building

5551.12 --> 5554.639
dnd you know i was doing that this is

5553.44 --> 5559.5199999999995
before i started

5554.639 --> 5561.76
remake dungeons and dragons my system

5559.52 --> 5564.56
but i was already engaged in building

5561.76 --> 5567.1990000000005
campaigns and [ __ ]

5564.56 --> 5569.52
just maps just maps constantly maps maps

5567.199 --> 5571.839999999999
maps maps making new maps making a new

5569.52 --> 5572.719
world just manifesting a new world out

5571.84 --> 5574.400000000001
of nothing

5572.719 --> 5576.0
and then figuring out what is this how

5574.4 --> 5579.28
does this work

5576.0 --> 5579.28
like running emulations

5581.12 --> 5592.0289999999995
damn it stupid piece of plastic

5588.83 --> 5592.0289999999995
[Music]

5592.159 --> 5603.839999999999
all right things like this [ __ ] there's

5594.88 --> 5603.84
a map

5605.13 --> 5608.719
[Music]

5606.88 --> 5611.12
looks exciting isn't it yeah there's

5608.719 --> 5613.44
people that actually played in this

5611.12 --> 5615.84
in this game in this map i tested it out

5613.44 --> 5617.839999999999
unfortunately it never lasted beyond a

5615.84 --> 5622.719
single

5617.84 --> 5622.719
time but they did

5624.8 --> 5630.96
kind of saddens me because they put so

5626.639 --> 5633.04
much freaking work into that map

5630.96 --> 5635.28
it's like this has already a world built

5633.04 --> 5636.8
story it was kind of sloppy but it has

5635.28 --> 5638.719
it

5636.8 --> 5640.8
and of course it's all about wizards of

5638.719 --> 5644.56
different colors and [ __ ]

5640.8 --> 5646.8
it's kind of basic still interesting

5644.56 --> 5648.0
in a way also inspired on the kind of

5646.8 --> 5651.1990000000005
the cosmology of

5648.0 --> 5652.239
magic gathering because i was a lot into

5651.199 --> 5658.4
that as well but

5652.239 --> 5662.0
back in the day right anyway

5658.4 --> 5663.839999999999
yeah that's what i wasted a lot of my

5662.0 --> 5667.76
time on back in the day

5663.84 --> 5671.6
it was really exhilarating to do it

5667.76 --> 5677.04
but yeah that did not

5671.6 --> 5677.04
a result that i am now a game developer

5684.84 --> 5687.84
unfortunately

5692.159 --> 5695.28
