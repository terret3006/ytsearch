[Music]

39.74 --> 48.480000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.83 --> 50.91
early-bird number 194 I'm your host

48.48 --> 52.65
Arwen and before we start the show

50.91 --> 55.739
please don't forget to share it on any

52.65 --> 57.03
platform you deem fit and also if you

55.739 --> 58.769999999999996
haven't already subscribed to my channel

57.03 --> 60.27
and hit the bell notifications so you

58.77 --> 62.190000000000005
know when I'm going live which is

60.27 --> 64.47
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time

62.19 --> 65.91
although today I'm I'm a little late and

64.47 --> 67.979
yesterday I was early in the day that

65.91 --> 69.8
even earlier so you never really know

67.979 --> 74.21
that's why you have to hit the head Bell

69.8 --> 81.14999999999999
so you know because I'm sometimes off

74.21 --> 85.619
anyway yeah today is a nice day very

81.15 --> 88.47
nice so nice actually that I that I got

85.619 --> 92.07
kind of late because I was just enjoying

88.47 --> 95.13
the outside and happened to bump into

92.07 --> 97.05
new people and had just fantastic

95.13 --> 99.72
conversations with them very interesting

97.05 --> 104.16
and by the way that also happened

99.72 --> 107.6
yesterday evening so yeah

104.16 --> 110.88
it's I feel like I'm really in a flow

107.6 --> 113.69999999999999
here in and just being able to hit the

110.88 --> 115.649
oversight and communicate it to people

113.7 --> 118.14
face to face even better than through

115.649 --> 120.66
the show when I just get to see texts

118.14 --> 123.69
and well when people get on my panel it

120.66 --> 125.88
works better but yeah I've been doing

123.69 --> 129.09
really great but then it was like oh

125.88 --> 134.28
wait what time is it hmm

129.09 --> 136.44
it's 8 to 2 ok didn't really look out

134.28 --> 138.75
for the time all that well so yeah

136.44 --> 143.25
that's why I'm late I hurried back but

138.75 --> 146.459
still late mmm I got to Mara coffee with

143.25 --> 149.22
me today I hopefully also will have tea

146.459 --> 152.13
but it's not done yet so I may have to

149.22 --> 154.68
get that later I tried to wear a coffee

152.13 --> 159.959
the same way but this time I put in yeah

154.68 --> 161.55
coffee milk I'd have to say I liked it

159.959 --> 170.43
better without it

161.55 --> 172.65
it's weird yeah it kind of also negates

170.43 --> 177.42000000000002
the peppery thing and I don't like that

172.65 --> 184.71
so but still yes still it feels good so

177.42 --> 188.19
let's see who's in chat mm-hmm all right

184.71 --> 190.32000000000002
got pretty crowded so the righteous

188.19 --> 195.18
forest drunken bullet for one-one Hagrid

190.32 --> 199.1
wells glass Shaw Obama kool-aid some

195.18 --> 199.1
clouds stopping traffic in my rest I hat

199.91 --> 209.9
must be up very late or very early

202.83 --> 216.63000000000002
daniel michael roark hm

209.9 --> 217.14000000000001
am i UK down corporate yeah good to see

216.63 --> 224.25
you all

217.14 --> 224.91
oh dude is it you okay well damn

224.25 --> 227.13
corporates

224.91 --> 230.54999999999998
that's the guy I talked to yesterday

227.13 --> 232.14
evening it was pretty awesome

230.55 --> 236.49
and yeah I talked to like this error

232.14 --> 239.54999999999998
Iranian guy who seemed to be very caught

236.49 --> 243.12
up in the political narrative of group

239.55 --> 245.07000000000002
that he supported and he was thus kind

243.12 --> 248.94
of oblivious to the widest structure

245.07 --> 251.9
things and Dan coppered was pretty much

248.94 --> 254.7
listening in on the side the whole time

251.9 --> 258.27
got a gut it was pretty challenging for

254.7 --> 259.28999999999996
me to do it to basically not try to

258.27 --> 261.989
insult him

259.29 --> 264.96000000000004
I will bring it very gradually and

261.989 --> 266.76
subtly and but it worked out great it

264.96 --> 269.43
was actually kind of funny at the end I

266.76 --> 271.17
don't know I'm not gonna explain the

269.43 --> 275.37
entire conversation was way too long but

271.17 --> 277.02000000000004
after that Dan and I engaged in

275.37 --> 281.45
conversation and we talked

277.02 --> 286.02
well mostly about my climate skepticism

281.45 --> 288.349
concerning co2 and I totally put a an

286.02 --> 291.139
entire level mountain

288.349 --> 294.08
level presentation in front of him and I

291.139 --> 296.089
don't know he wants to study it I think

294.08 --> 298.639
so I hope I'm not giving too much away

296.089 --> 303.71
of you at Dan corporate but really good

298.639 --> 305.809
to see you joining yeah I'm I guess

303.71 --> 308.599
you're not all that surprised by the

305.809 --> 311.119
flat earth in the title which I

308.599 --> 313.30899999999997
literally did not bring up a single time

311.119 --> 315.28900000000004
in the conversation yesterday even

313.309 --> 320.21000000000004
though I was kind of already hinting it

315.289 --> 322.159
towards the Iranian man but he

320.21 --> 326.719
definitely wasn't ready since he was

322.159 --> 330.55899999999997
like having space and and planets and

326.719 --> 334.009
exploration stories in his wider view so

330.559 --> 336.68
he seems to be dependent on that not

334.009 --> 341.47900000000004
gonna break it to him but I guess that

336.68 --> 345.02
you don't mind anyway so good to see a

341.479 --> 347.949
new face and today again I had a yeah

345.02 --> 351.709
and the conversation with a Polish guy

347.949 --> 352.939
kind of my own age and he was very smart

351.709 --> 355.279
as well he was having a conversation

352.939 --> 356.959
with a couple of locals that keep on

355.279 --> 359.449
hanging around the coffee shop outside

356.959 --> 361.669
and it was really nice and sunny and not

359.449 --> 364.61
too windy at the locations or sitting

361.669 --> 367.459
there as well and then I couldn't got

364.61 --> 370.519
caught in a conversation with him very

367.459 --> 373.719
good as well about the wider geopolitics

370.519 --> 377.349
mostly and how complicated that is and

373.719 --> 379.55
how the narrative is not what it seems

377.349 --> 383.68899999999996
literally and that it's kind of designed

379.55 --> 388.61
to polarize you and agitate you to set

383.689 --> 392.269
yourself in a certain position to lose

388.61 --> 396.619
oversight to become subjective to the

392.269 --> 398.779
situation every time and yeah he really

396.619 --> 400.59900000000005
got it that's in the conversation today

398.779 --> 406.699
that's what I talked about with him and

400.599 --> 409.789
I seem to respect it maybe who knows

406.699 --> 412.49
yeah he said also there may be some

409.789 --> 417.789
interesting connections I'm connecting

412.49 --> 420.8
in so I'll keep you posted about that

417.789 --> 424.729
but I feel strong I feel hidden the flow

420.8 --> 428.72
despite the giant blow to the face from

424.729 --> 431.24
freakin government that just decided not

428.72 --> 433.129
even in a penalty setting just take all

431.24 --> 437.18
the money away that I just made with

433.129 --> 437.47900000000004
Google this year so despite that pissing

437.18 --> 439.699
me off

437.479 --> 443.419
I guess I'm using my pissed-off Nessa

439.699 --> 448.159
bout that to just be even better it's

443.419 --> 450.10999999999996
like that's the thing I used to do that

448.159 --> 452.509
always it's like oh really you're gonna

450.11 --> 453.5
try to put me down punish me to kind of

452.509 --> 456.91900000000004
put me down

453.5 --> 459.62
okay I'll be four times as impressive

456.919 --> 461.12
and more focused and you'll just totally

459.62 --> 464.569
not know what to do with it because I

461.12 --> 467.06
totally I'll do you that's what I I have

464.569 --> 470.93
an instinct for that it's a self-defense

467.06 --> 475.09
mechanism using my intellect I learned

470.93 --> 475.09000000000003
very young in my preteens

481.11 --> 486.349
and they yeah good to see everyone in

489.169 --> 499.779
what I'm making dipping tobacco what

493.84 --> 499.779
Resta doing some weird experiments

504.4 --> 508.65999999999997
oh yeah also by the way happy to report

506.68 --> 510.76
you might have noticed no chemtrails

508.66 --> 515.65
here today so yes they seem to have quit

510.76 --> 519.789
and today also and I have an interesting

515.65 --> 524.35
weird new very spontaneous I guess chem

519.789 --> 527.29
trail related conspiracy concept because

524.35 --> 529.0
they're what is yeah it's hard to prove

527.29 --> 532.74
though it's gonna be very remote but

529.0 --> 535.36
there was a weird thing that before

532.74 --> 541.27
yesterday morning basically the the week

535.36 --> 547.029
before that there was this weird buzz

541.27 --> 552.1899999999999
going around what is it like almost like

547.029 --> 554.32
spider webby stuff or plant fluff like

552.19 --> 557.8900000000001
from blossom kind of thing it was

554.32 --> 560.32
everywhere like within a certain period

557.89 --> 563.29
of the year there of certain trees that

560.32 --> 565.12
just they look like they're just they're

563.29 --> 567.16
totally fluffy and then that blossom

565.12 --> 569.98
just goes everywhere and it's like fluff

567.16 --> 572.4399999999999
piles up almost like snow but that's not

569.98 --> 575.11
this time of year that's like in August

572.44 --> 577.0600000000001
and September that that happens so this

575.11 --> 580.0600000000001
just came out of there like this was

577.06 --> 582.0699999999999
happening but I thought about is like

580.06 --> 586.0889999999999
where's this really coming from and then

582.07 --> 589.33
I thought are they spraying that [ __ ]

586.089 --> 591.25
with the chemtrails like what do they I

589.33 --> 594.72
talked about before what do they really

591.25 --> 598.62
spray are they just doing the aluminum

594.72 --> 601.6
powder and the barium salts like

598.62 --> 604.12
originally or are they literally just

601.6 --> 607.9300000000001
weirdly experimenting with all kinds of

604.12 --> 609.82
[ __ ] including organic components and

607.93 --> 611.38
that was also suggested by Alex Jones

609.82 --> 613.6
earlier on that they would do that with

611.38 --> 616.959
Forrester's oh my god

613.6 --> 619.72
and the Morgellons stuff that was also

616.959 --> 622.26
something else but yeah who knows

619.72 --> 622.26
they're just

623.55 --> 629.8299999999999
technically they could just be spraying

625.84 --> 631.7800000000001
bugs if they wanted to maybe even for

629.83 --> 633.49
good purposes it's like they'll know

631.78 --> 637.12
they'll not tell us because it's

633.49 --> 638.74
completely classified but it doesn't

637.12 --> 640.75
always have to be in the fairies

638.74 --> 643.99
nefarious people don't always have to be

640.75 --> 646.33
the ones in the direct control of it or

643.99 --> 648.25
in the general control of it like

646.33 --> 650.35
nefarious people may at some point like

648.25 --> 653.11
yeah and now we are taking over for this

650.35 --> 654.94
strategical purpose but in general the

653.11 --> 657.25
general managers I don't think that

654.94 --> 662.5600000000001
they're all necessarily nefarious that

657.25 --> 664.78
they're part of that that evil control

662.56 --> 669.8499999999999
as it were so maybe they're just

664.78 --> 672.3399999999999
spraying stuff fluff and bugs maybe

669.85 --> 674.98
sometimes and sometimes they may indeed

672.34 --> 676.72
like okay let's help out the

674.98 --> 680.7
pharmaceutical industry by making

676.72 --> 684.37
everybody sneeze now something like that

680.7 --> 686.23
when the house they might be sneeze if

684.37 --> 690.25
the spraying sneezing powder that's just

686.23 --> 692.85
crazy but who knows I doubt look you'd

690.25 --> 697.42
have to like really I would have to have

692.85 --> 700.11
like glass jars with water and really

697.42 --> 702.79
make samples all the time and just then

700.11 --> 704.53
through laboratory figure out what is in

702.79 --> 707.0799999999999
it every time what is it it what is

704.53 --> 711.0699999999999
typically unnaturally in it what is new

707.08 --> 713.11
what comes shortly in a certain wave and

711.07 --> 715.0
then really figure out what is being

713.11 --> 717.13
released in the air and that might also

715.0 --> 719.26
be originating from the ground but

717.13 --> 720.97
definitely there may be a direct

719.26 --> 722.11
correlation with the amount of

720.97 --> 723.73
chemtrails visible

722.11 --> 728.49
well yeah it's gonna take a lot of

723.73 --> 728.49
effort and a losing effort re-access so

729.95 --> 734.58
right Rasta

731.88 --> 736.17
well yeah you're right on top of it or

734.58 --> 737.76
while you're underneath it but you you

736.17 --> 739.65
pay a lot of attention to chemtrails

737.76 --> 743.46
because they have big in they do

739.65 --> 745.05
definitely do toxic [ __ ] in the United

743.46 --> 747.51
States more than they do in Europe

745.05 --> 752.75
definitely I think a Europe they still

747.51 --> 756.3199999999999
apply pharmaceutical promoting [ __ ] but

752.75 --> 765.27
not necessarily just overall destroyer

756.32 --> 767.6600000000001
destroying substances anyway chemtrails

765.27 --> 767.66
yeah

776.26 --> 781.48
right

778.82 --> 781.48
okay

790.04 --> 799.0899999999999
ooh Eric Dubay made a new video sure

793.51 --> 799.09
maybe I'll check it out although I

800.92 --> 807.9699999999999
I have a weird thing recently look it

804.699 --> 810.3689999999999
comes in waves but like even in the Flat

807.97 --> 813.879
Earth debates it's like yay yeah we're

810.369 --> 816.609
winning and oh I can make this point

813.879 --> 819.009
over and over again like really well and

816.609 --> 823.9290000000001
really on the money and correct but it's

819.009 --> 826.179
like I guess it would be necessary for a

823.929 --> 829.72
period to just hammer it in there as in

826.179 --> 832.529
the debates happens but for me to be

829.72 --> 834.879
fair it's getting a bit boring and

832.529 --> 836.279
that's why I have this weird tendency to

834.879 --> 840.809
interrupt more and more and just

836.279 --> 843.579
completely break open new many ideas

840.809 --> 846.699
because I don't like repetition a lot

843.579 --> 849.429
even made that very clear before I

846.699 --> 851.139
started the early bird show with my

849.429 --> 858.279
flower talks I don't like to repeat

851.139 --> 860.7090000000001
myself too much unless it's really to

858.279 --> 864.009
tie new things in together with the

860.709 --> 866.669
older things to place it into the web or

864.009 --> 870.629
oversight that's something else

866.669 --> 870.629
balloon spiders what

875.199 --> 884.149
all right the you mean the buoyancy

878.6 --> 888.2900000000001
spiders the ones that ride hot air that

884.149 --> 890.93
tie themselves down with a spider thread

888.29 --> 895.66
and then indeed let themselves float

890.93 --> 895.66
yeah I get balloon spiders that's funny

895.839 --> 901.9100000000001
yeah i-i've seen that there's an I've

899.899 --> 905.26
seen that in nature documentaries as

901.91 --> 905.26
well as very interesting other works

911.03 --> 914.13
[Music]

918.67 --> 926.06
but yeah flat smacking people like I'm

921.92 --> 928.52
always careful about that look flat

926.06 --> 930.89
smacking people to me is really just if

928.52 --> 934.04
somebody's capable of doing it and I'm

930.89 --> 936.68
much better at sizing up if they are in

934.04 --> 940.76
front now because I've spent a lot of

936.68 --> 943.64
energy in trying to amplify my analysis

940.76 --> 946.5699999999999
skill in gauging what what's going on

943.64 --> 952.79
and how other people work on on the fly

946.57 --> 955.94
and I'm getting good at it and Flat

952.79 --> 961.91
Earth is just that grand new ground it

955.94 --> 965.1500000000001
is just like oh look oh this entire

961.91 --> 968.12
region you thought was always there and

965.15 --> 971.4499999999999
part of everything turns out not to be

968.12 --> 974.51
real at all and you can figure out even

971.45 --> 976.49
how they constructed it and that's like

974.51 --> 977.93
yeah when you break open to that for the

976.49 --> 979.94
very first time then it's really

977.93 --> 981.1999999999999
fascinating or you yeah of course you

979.94 --> 983.09
have the allergic reaction to

981.2 --> 987.0500000000001
conditioning and then like oh my god

983.09 --> 989.48
that's stupid and hurts it hurts because

987.05 --> 992.24
like wow all that thing that I relied

989.48 --> 995.8100000000001
upon and that propelled me was close to

992.24 --> 998.8100000000001
what drove me it's gonna hurt if you

995.81 --> 1001.1199999999999
figure out that was a lie but yeah you

998.81 --> 1002.8
can refined that purpose it's typically

1001.12 --> 1004.21
what a lot of flat-earthers go through

1002.8 --> 1006.76
when they're really when they hit it

1004.21 --> 1009.94
then they can get like sleepless a month

1006.76 --> 1014.65
of sleepless nights cuz of it but then

1009.94 --> 1017.08
they re they get reborn they really can

1014.65 --> 1018.73
and they start to learn while they

1017.08 --> 1021.64
already would be learning but then they

1018.73 --> 1026.8600000000001
really start to figure out what they can

1021.64 --> 1029.29
do with it when everybody but in the

1026.86 --> 1031.8
flat earth community is has done that at

1029.29 --> 1031.8
some point

1036.18 --> 1047.14
so dad that just happens and it's not

1045.31 --> 1050.2
something that I that I'm getting

1047.14 --> 1052.24
obsessed over and also yeah I've been

1050.2 --> 1054.8400000000001
digging so much into the Flat Earth and

1052.24 --> 1057.3700000000001
I know these things so much by heart

1054.84 --> 1060.4599999999998
eventually it's like when you're a

1057.37 --> 1062.32
musician and you are like a really good

1060.46 --> 1066.0
at what you do and you have these really

1062.32 --> 1069.01
awesome songs every time you play them

1066.0 --> 1071.56
the crowd will go nuts and be like oh my

1069.01 --> 1074.05
god so awesome to hear this life but

1071.56 --> 1079.75
often for these musicians they've been

1074.05 --> 1082.0
doing that for like 200 to 500 times

1079.75 --> 1084.4
that exact same routine they can't

1082.0 --> 1085.96
really feel that love anymore and I'm

1084.4 --> 1087.91
having a bit of that as well as like

1085.96 --> 1092.43
yeah I know I know exactly what it's

1087.91 --> 1095.8000000000002
like I but for me it's like I get it I

1092.43 --> 1097.78
get it now it's it's getting a bit old

1095.8 --> 1101.77
but not because it's becoming worthless

1097.78 --> 1105.91
it's just that I'm I'm kind of saturated

1101.77 --> 1107.35
with it seems or maybe I'm just not

1105.91 --> 1111.13
satisfied with the tempo the

1107.35 --> 1113.1
developments are taking and that's why

1111.13 --> 1117.49
I'm just delving you know these

1113.1 --> 1120.8799999999999
presuppositional side roads just to keep

1117.49 --> 1122.8
myself occupied and to prickle people's

1120.88 --> 1127.99
imagination of the possibilities and

1122.8 --> 1131.47
everything but flat earth awakening yeah

1127.99 --> 1132.82
it's very special moment but you got to

1131.47 --> 1134.94
do it right if you're just gonna smack

1132.82 --> 1138.58
somebody in the face it with it

1134.94 --> 1141.04
especially face to face then yeah you

1138.58 --> 1143.8
might just end up getting people that

1141.04 --> 1146.71
will be suspicious of you for a very

1143.8 --> 1149.68
long time and that'll ruin the chemistry

1146.71 --> 1151.8700000000001
in the atmosphere or in the region where

1149.68 --> 1155.5
you are when you interact and they are

1151.87 --> 1158.2299999999998
in your presence so I'm I try to be very

1155.5 --> 1160.69
subtle with my interactions I'm not bad

1158.23 --> 1162.7
guy that always just immediately walks

1160.69 --> 1167.5900000000001
up to everyone absolutely not

1162.7 --> 1170.2
very modest general I I stand around I

1167.59 --> 1172.809
observe oh yes and I do not try to hide

1170.2 --> 1174.52
that observe so when people like take

1172.809 --> 1179.67
notice of like hey he's looking then I'm

1174.52 --> 1181.87
like yeah hi I'm open about it and

1179.67 --> 1183.8200000000002
that's the way that I do it but I'm not

1181.87 --> 1188.37
like the guy that just immediately walks

1183.82 --> 1191.59
up to a group and just be all tired i

1188.37 --> 1193.32
I've never liked doing that I can

1191.59 --> 1196.1789999999999
technically do it if it's like really

1193.32 --> 1197.53
important to engage somehow and can

1196.179 --> 1200.94
force myself to do it but I don't

1197.53 --> 1206.7
naturally do that but don't like it

1200.94 --> 1209.5
so Flat Earth yeah it's always there

1206.7 --> 1212.23
especially in conversations where the

1209.5 --> 1215.32
consciousness is involved then

1212.23 --> 1218.89
eventually if somebody has the level the

1215.32 --> 1221.11
depth for it then it's inevitable that

1218.89 --> 1225.3700000000001
they will be confronted with it and I'd

1221.11 --> 1228.6399999999999
prefer that they then have that moment

1225.37 --> 1232.51
that transition as comfortable as

1228.64 --> 1234.7900000000002
possible that they don't panic from it

1232.51 --> 1240.61
and they realized the hold on this guy

1234.79 --> 1244.99
was already there and he feels just as

1240.61 --> 1247.6599999999999
inspired about certain things as I do

1244.99 --> 1249.34
about space and like even I always say

1247.66 --> 1252.7900000000002
it's like it's not necessarily gone it's

1249.34 --> 1257.6499999999999
just not literally gonna happen but you

1252.79 --> 1259.4189999999999
can still enjoy the dream of it but

1257.65 --> 1266.52
still you have to realize it's a dream

1259.419 --> 1268.99
it's not real so that's just my approach

1266.52 --> 1273.6
you know otherwise you're just gonna

1268.99 --> 1277.71
have the hate of of that space and

1273.6 --> 1277.7099999999998
that's not good for anything really

1277.87 --> 1283.9299999999998
she'd hate the line not the creation of

1281.54 --> 1283.93
it

1299.1 --> 1306.27
oh really Daniel well maybe you should

1303.69 --> 1309.0
challenge him on that maybe you could

1306.27 --> 1312.09
extrapolate I'm not gonna look if you're

1309.0 --> 1315.03
really gonna challenge QE for something

1312.09 --> 1317.34
like that if you're just gonna do that

1315.03 --> 1320.94
in check then it's just gonna be taken

1317.34 --> 1323.22
as a whiny baller thing a bluff because

1320.94 --> 1326.46
you really gotta put yourself forward

1323.22 --> 1331.02
and then put that out because I have my

1326.46 --> 1334.02
doubts about John's sourcing as well not

1331.02 --> 1339.47
that I say that he's a cherry picker but

1334.02 --> 1346.3799999999999
I think that he might be a semantic I

1339.47 --> 1351.1200000000001
say a semantic opportunist and I've

1346.38 --> 1354.21
already explained that even so I'm cured

1351.12 --> 1359.2199999999998
if there's if people can actually find

1354.21 --> 1363.45
real real foundation for that I love it

1359.22 --> 1367.59
because I general don't really like yeah

1363.45 --> 1371.82
quantum erasers dogmatic attitude in

1367.59 --> 1375.0
general so I would like to move on again

1371.82 --> 1380.9399999999998
I don't like stagnation for whatever

1375.0 --> 1383.34
reason but yeah if it's just

1380.94 --> 1386.16
oh it's all wrong and it turns out to be

1383.34 --> 1388.26
the exact same [ __ ] like Brenda was

1386.16 --> 1391.98
doing and rumpus is doing you know that

1388.26 --> 1394.56
yet that's just gonna turn you in one of

1391.98 --> 1396.81
those really really annoying ballers

1394.56 --> 1401.6699999999998
that I don't have as much respect for as

1396.81 --> 1404.79
I used to have so don't go there on me

1401.67 --> 1407.3300000000002
Daniel please unless you like have real

1404.79 --> 1407.33
things

1417.19 --> 1421.5990000000002
look if you have a serious case then you

1419.649 --> 1423.9989999999998
have to build it as a case just a bunch

1421.599 --> 1424.57
of rumors and accusations isn't gonna

1423.999 --> 1429.57
cut it

1424.57 --> 1432.729
I'm serious you have to make a case a

1429.57 --> 1435.97
system you have to actually build a

1432.729 --> 1437.739
foundation it's like a lawyer thing you

1435.97 --> 1439.96
have to build a case you have to build a

1437.739 --> 1445.8400000000001
structure that makes it real and not

1439.96 --> 1449.08
just some talk you have to get sourcing

1445.84 --> 1451.9889999999998
and then you have to extrapolate on the

1449.08 --> 1455.499
details and make it real and not some

1451.989 --> 1459.159
[ __ ] nonsense with a lot of red

1455.499 --> 1461.349
herrings as usual and straw men so oh by

1459.159 --> 1465.669
the way I do have a Illuminati car song

1461.349 --> 1468.639
with me and I'm gonna get my tea so you

1465.669 --> 1470.8200000000002
think on that Daniel I'll be back in two

1468.639 --> 1470.82
minutes

1520.37 --> 1523.78
[Music]

1546.89 --> 1553.26
citation citation citations well give me

1550.11 --> 1556.799
your library of citations and you know

1553.26 --> 1559.29
what on this show I'll read them all out

1556.799 --> 1562.1399999999999
all of them even if it takes like 30

1559.29 --> 1565.95
minutes I really read all of it and then

1562.14 --> 1567.99
I'll give my proper analysis and already

1565.95 --> 1568.97
pretty much know you're gonna be very

1567.99 --> 1572.01
disappointed

1568.97 --> 1577.98
and so will I because I would love to

1572.01 --> 1582.72
get some truly significant proof that

1577.98 --> 1585.51
it's not just what we have been taught

1582.72 --> 1587.7
basically through John and through our

1585.51 --> 1591.179
own research so far what that it is what

1587.7 --> 1592.8600000000001
it is so yeah bring it on I'll look

1591.179 --> 1596.19
through the data I'm not gonna dad like

1592.86 --> 1598.02
oh the soul should crayon munching blah

1596.19 --> 1601.73
blah no I'll actually just read through

1598.02 --> 1601.73
it so bring it on

1640.99 --> 1654.76
that's hilarious bluekey now that's a

1650.05 --> 1657.43
misconception the flat earth or the flat

1654.76 --> 1658.45
earthers don't think there is a molten

1657.43 --> 1663.67
iron core

1658.45 --> 1667.8400000000001
there's not even a core and besides

1663.67 --> 1670.39
there's really no actual confirmed

1667.84 --> 1674.5
physical proof of a molten iron core or

1670.39 --> 1679.0200000000002
even a molten layer and trust me we dug

1674.5 --> 1683.23
into this also have our opponents deeply

1679.02 --> 1688.45
and I've even inquired on actual

1683.23 --> 1690.1
geologists and there really is no proof

1688.45 --> 1698.6100000000001
of it it's all deduced based

1690.1 --> 1701.4099999999999
speculations and they even adapt their

1698.61 --> 1705.1299999999999
interpretation of the data analysis to

1701.41 --> 1707.2
fit the presupposition that there is a

1705.13 --> 1709.45
molten iron core but even recently

1707.2 --> 1710.53
they've tried to adapt it and just

1709.45 --> 1713.68
suggest that it works slightly

1710.53 --> 1715.87
differently and that there are solid

1713.68 --> 1718.8100000000002
layers as well and like they're being

1715.87 --> 1721.78
rearranging it so they're still not

1718.81 --> 1724.1499999999999
settled as to how it's Supre supposedly

1721.78 --> 1727.75
has to be it's just another part of the

1724.15 --> 1729.3100000000002
fiction science just like outer space

1727.75 --> 1734.62
and how that all supposed to work

1729.31 --> 1736.77
there's no proof of that either so there

1734.62 --> 1741.2199999999998
is no molten iron core on Flat Earth

1736.77 --> 1745.0
definitely not there is lava though but

1741.22 --> 1749.17
how that actually works how that is

1745.0 --> 1751.33
arrived how that arrives that's much

1749.17 --> 1754.63
more complex and there is no certainty

1751.33 --> 1756.58
about it I have had hangouts

1754.63 --> 1760.2700000000002
specifically dedicated to what our

1756.58 --> 1764.83
volcanoes in the past and I suggest

1760.27 --> 1766.18
several potential possibilities it's

1764.83 --> 1768.1599999999999
definitely going to be a natural

1766.18 --> 1771.3400000000001
phenomenon and it might have something

1768.16 --> 1773.44
to do with electrical induction that

1771.34 --> 1774.08
might occur naturally maybe involving

1773.44 --> 1777.7
the

1774.08 --> 1783.1699999999998
Earth's magnetic activity down below or

1777.7 --> 1785.93
something in that direction so there is

1783.17 --> 1788.18
definitely lava but it is not a core or

1785.93 --> 1791.54
a layer of lava on RIT on which

1788.18 --> 1793.67
everything earthly rests there's no

1791.54 --> 1795.8899999999999
proof for that at all and even with

1793.67 --> 1800.5
tectonics the suggestion that it is all

1795.89 --> 1805.13
resting on the layer of liquid magma is

1800.5 --> 1808.19
kind of like to emulate the skin setup

1805.13 --> 1809.93
and yeah tectonics there is a shifting

1808.19 --> 1812.54
there is a breaking it's pushing into

1809.93 --> 1814.16
each other yes but it's now proof that

1812.54 --> 1818.57
it's actually happening on a molten

1814.16 --> 1822.26
layer and you supposedly heat remnants

1818.57 --> 1825.05
and everything from from the lava being

1822.26 --> 1827.03
scraped into onto it onto the other

1825.05 --> 1830.27
layer and all that that's not such as

1827.03 --> 1833.36
well because yeah super high pressure

1830.27 --> 1837.65
and then friction it will sometimes be

1833.36 --> 1840.62
strong enough just to create so much

1837.65 --> 1843.3700000000001
heat and that it will make it will

1840.62 --> 1846.4699999999998
likely create lava just from the shear

1843.37 --> 1852.35
forces that is unleashed on it even

1846.47 --> 1854.65
locally so it's just not what they say

1852.35 --> 1854.6499999999999
it is

1871.3 --> 1873.33
Oh

1875.07 --> 1881.36
that's ridiculous that's not that you

1878.13 --> 1884.5200000000002
have no idea about the technicalities of

1881.36 --> 1886.32
of scientific debate yet Lukey Kaelin

1884.52 --> 1888.87
you should check out the flatter the bed

1886.32 --> 1891.6
you'll learn a lot be slapped in the

1888.87 --> 1893.6399999999999
face with it actually so well everything

1891.6 --> 1896.1599999999999
I said is not proof of a globe not even

1893.64 --> 1899.13
close and just as I said

1896.16 --> 1901.26
local induction that doesn't mean B

1899.13 --> 1905.43
entire freaking earth and besides they

1901.26 --> 1908.52
supposed standard earth activity how

1905.43 --> 1910.6200000000001
could that cause induction that strong

1908.52 --> 1913.8899999999999
to keep that doesn't make any sense with

1910.62 --> 1915.1499999999999
the entire supposed setup of the cosmo

1913.89 --> 1917.19
genie of the globe earth in the other

1915.15 --> 1919.5
universe does make it it's not accounted

1917.19 --> 1921.54
for at all it's not like that it's even

1919.5 --> 1923.79
suggested it's slightly cooling off as

1921.54 --> 1928.77
time goes so that doesn't make any sense

1923.79 --> 1931.4099999999999
no mine my example is pure different

1928.77 --> 1934.56
angle to it like how what could locally

1931.41 --> 1937.3200000000002
naturally make laughs a sprout forth and

1934.56 --> 1940.5
on a small level and not see it I'm not

1937.32 --> 1944.28
saying a constant induction process that

1940.5 --> 1948.99
is literally melting huge quantities of

1944.28 --> 1950.91
matter no it's local like a critical

1948.99 --> 1952.23
crossroads type of phenomena and then

1950.91 --> 1955.92
lava may occur there

1952.23 --> 1959.19
and as the laughs I would naturally come

1955.92 --> 1960.93
into being through the heats just in its

1959.19 --> 1962.31
point it would cause pressure and that

1960.93 --> 1965.3100000000002
would typically already have like a

1962.31 --> 1967.5
volcano effect because just that local

1965.31 --> 1973.86
piece will try to expand and that will

1967.5 --> 1981.33
cause it to want to escape that pressure

1973.86 --> 1984.4599999999998
zone and that can be completely local so

1981.33 --> 1987.8999999999999
yeah definitely does not prove a

1984.46 --> 1987.9
bluebird sorry about that

1993.01 --> 2001.28
Daniel you can try

2012.23 --> 2020.43
no no Dan covered the earth does not

2015.24 --> 2024.1200000000001
have edges is this literally like the

2020.43 --> 2028.02
first time you've ever engaged with

2024.12 --> 2030.2099999999998
flatter things because these are all the

2028.02 --> 2032.87
I'm not saying that's bad of you but

2030.21 --> 2037.23
these are typically the newbie questions

2032.87 --> 2040.4699999999998
first comer questions so yeah no there's

2037.23 --> 2042.1200000000001
definitely no edge to the earth and if

2040.47 --> 2044.3600000000001
there were there are several conceptions

2042.12 --> 2047.9699999999998
of how the Flat Earth realm would work

2044.36 --> 2051.149
that differ greatly so one of the most

2047.97 --> 2055.71
common conceptualizations is the snow

2051.149 --> 2063.8399999999997
globe earth and it does not have an edge

2055.71 --> 2066.06
what it would have is a dome border so

2063.84 --> 2068.429
it's not an edge on which you can fall

2066.06 --> 2070.56
off into outer space or anything because

2068.429 --> 2073.37
that outer space it was never there it

2070.56 --> 2076.74
is always been in our imagination we

2073.37 --> 2078.7799999999997
just get to see a lot of lights and that

2076.74 --> 2082.29
manifests themselves up there it's very

2078.78 --> 2084.21
specific way we've all deduced the

2082.29 --> 2086.58
angular relations that all these lights

2084.21 --> 2092.01
have including the daylight by the way

2086.58 --> 2094.83
the Sun and the moon and that's been

2092.01 --> 2096.659
recorded by the ancients even and it's

2094.83 --> 2099.24
called the astrological charts it's very

2096.659 --> 2103.76
fascinating a lot of extrapolations

2099.24 --> 2103.7599999999998
about it we talked about that yesterday

2112.55 --> 2120.1600000000003
oh yeah by the way I'm Daniel right

2122.17 --> 2126.53
stand for it

2123.91 --> 2131.54
hey Daniel can't you just send it to my

2126.53 --> 2136.28
email or something just send it to our

2131.54 --> 2137.81
win 33 at gmail.com I think that would

2136.28 --> 2139.01
be the easiest I'll take a look at it

2137.81 --> 2140.66
I'm not gonna do this on the show

2139.01 --> 2143.3900000000003
anymore anyways because it's way too

2140.66 --> 2150.16
short I'm gonna run out in about eight

2143.39 --> 2150.16
or ten minutes send it to my email

2182.19 --> 2190.03
sorry about this hmm it is tasting quite

2186.339 --> 2194.2
good though but yeah I do definitely

2190.03 --> 2196.5890000000004
want to thank Dan corporate for as a

2194.2 --> 2200.6189999999997
newcomer basically getting in here and

2196.589 --> 2202.599
being subjected to all these weird new

2200.619 --> 2205.9300000000003
ideas that you've probably not been

2202.599 --> 2209.38
subjected to a lot and I hope that you

2205.93 --> 2211.21
will consider coming back and see it

2209.38 --> 2217.089
yeah if you can try to figure out

2211.21 --> 2221.2
because it is all very complex but keep

2217.089 --> 2223.9
on asking questions maybe dig on check

2221.2 --> 2228.7599999999998
out the Flat Earth debates it's run by a

2223.9 --> 2237.819
guy called Nathan Oakley look up on

2228.76 --> 2243.46
YouTube I I'd get on his show as a

2237.819 --> 2247.63
panelist so check it out

2243.46 --> 2249.309
yeah they are very strictly technically

2247.63 --> 2251.2000000000003
dedicated to Flat Earth most of the time

2249.309 --> 2255.6090000000004
although sometimes conversations wander

2251.2 --> 2257.2889999999998
off into creationism or religious aspect

2255.609 --> 2259.39
but usually it's just a lot of Flat

2257.289 --> 2263.9500000000003
Earth and ballers fat versus flat

2259.39 --> 2269.5589999999997
earthers and yeah there are kind of

2263.95 --> 2271.96
harsh against ballers and sometimes it's

2269.559 --> 2274.869
quite a challenge but the de solid

2271.96 --> 2277.9900000000002
central points remain pretty solid and

2274.869 --> 2279.94
I've been yeah supporting that those

2277.99 --> 2283.569
concept for a long time it's called the

2279.94 --> 2285.4900000000002
housekeeping questions I definitely

2283.569 --> 2289.359
check out the Flat Earth debate it

2285.49 --> 2289.779
should be starting by the way live oh no

2289.359 --> 2293.44
wait

2289.779 --> 2295.65
of course it's Saturday damn it right so

2293.44 --> 2298.69
Flat Earth debate doesn't actually start

2295.65 --> 2301.119
in the weekends it's only Monday to

2298.69 --> 2303.58
Friday but there is a ball busters this

2301.119 --> 2306.55
evening but that's

2303.58 --> 2310.6
it's 8 p.m.

2306.55 --> 2313.6000000000004
Amsterdam time for us so yeah you might

2310.6 --> 2315.0699999999997
be you might want to watch that I don't

2313.6 --> 2317.08
know how interesting you would find it

2315.07 --> 2321.01
it's probably not as open-minded as I

2317.08 --> 2322.42
tend to be but it you will be able to

2321.01 --> 2327.67
learn a lot of things so I definitely

2322.42 --> 2332.98
recommend you keep track and get back to

2327.67 --> 2337.51
me you know and don't worry as long as

2332.98 --> 2339.79
you as long as your intentions your your

2337.51 --> 2341.71
underlying intent you whatever feelings

2339.79 --> 2342.97
you have about this does really matter

2341.71 --> 2346.15
but as long as your underlying

2342.97 --> 2349.99
attentions are good not nefarious and

2346.15 --> 2351.76
I'll answer any question any question

2349.99 --> 2354.3399999999997
I've already pretty much have this

2351.76 --> 2359.9500000000003
arrangement with Daniel who has been

2354.34 --> 2362.08
pretty dedicated baller and mathematics

2359.95 --> 2363.97
enthusiasts and all that and he has

2362.08 --> 2366.58
great questions but he does actually

2363.97 --> 2369.1299999999997
respect me unlike some other ballers

2366.58 --> 2371.77
that are just try to troll Flat Earth

2369.13 --> 2372.61
it's like insane and drone um they're

2371.77 --> 2377.79
stupid

2372.61 --> 2380.65
peer pressure nonsense and rhetoric

2377.79 --> 2383.56
standard rhetoric on purpose it's really

2380.65 --> 2389.8
nasty but I yeah Daniel is not like that

2383.56 --> 2392.13
I haven't experienced you like that so

2389.8 --> 2392.13
far

2394.09 --> 2401.2000000000003
