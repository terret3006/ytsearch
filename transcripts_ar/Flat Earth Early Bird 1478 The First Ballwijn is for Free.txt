you can

97.259 --> 103.92
uh right the weather today

99.96 --> 106.979
is pretty nice I guess

103.92 --> 108.84
it's a little me and there's like a

106.979 --> 110.64
couple of clouds up there and a bit of

108.84 --> 112.619
haze but

110.64 --> 115.02
it's not there's still some blue in

112.619 --> 117.119
between it it doesn't look like there's

115.02 --> 119.46
been

117.119 --> 121.74
Trails left by planes and that's what

119.46 --> 124.67999999999999
caused it so

121.74 --> 126.78
and yeah I went out for groceries

124.68 --> 129.42000000000002
earlier today because it was just really

126.78 --> 133.16
nice and sunny and it was just like I

129.42 --> 133.16
want to go out in that right now

133.44 --> 137.78
and so I did

134.94 --> 142.76
but yeah because of that I'm late

137.78 --> 142.76
it took some time literally to dry up

144.9 --> 149.87900000000002
because I'm not gonna start the show all

146.94 --> 153.48
sweaty and all that but uh yeah it's

149.879 --> 156.12
it's decently nice weather and

153.48 --> 158.459
it's been dry so far

156.12 --> 161.59900000000002
even though yesterday it definitely it

158.459 --> 161.599
went raining pretty hard

162.379 --> 166.16
like after my show

167.34 --> 173.70000000000002

[Music]

182.94 --> 189.42
video had been removed no I removed it

187.019 --> 191.94
there's no point in keeping that flub

189.42 --> 193.379
around I removed it because it's just

191.94 --> 195.72
the same title

193.379 --> 199.85999999999999
so don't worry about it

195.72 --> 202.319

202.319 --> 205.33999999999997
that's good

205.56 --> 209.44
being busy is the best reason not to

208.08 --> 212.64000000000001
show up

209.44 --> 216.07999999999998
[Music]

212.64 --> 216.07999999999998
glad you're still doing okay

216.9 --> 219.48000000000002
don't know if you've still been

218.099 --> 222.06
following me

219.48 --> 224.28
or are you really like completely Tapped

222.06 --> 227.299
Out of the internet

224.28 --> 230.28
which is not unwise

227.299 --> 232.87900000000002
seeing how bad it's getting overall

230.28 --> 232.879
everywhere

236.18 --> 241.44
anyway right so yeah today's a short

239.76 --> 243.06
show so

241.44 --> 246.739
one hour

243.06 --> 246.739
and I don't know maybe longer

247.7 --> 252.599
completely taped out Tapped Out yeah I

250.68 --> 254.93900000000002
get it for a while yeah yeah good good

252.599 --> 257.53999999999996
and you man

254.939 --> 257.54
it's a

258.359 --> 261.68
can be very necessary

262.76 --> 265.959
[Music]

266.52 --> 271.02
right

267.72 --> 273.86
so yeah I thought my show yesterday was

271.02 --> 273.85999999999996
pretty damn good

274.74 --> 283.40000000000003
yeah then Nathan Oakley's happened

277.979 --> 283.4
and that absolutely ruined it

289.68 --> 293.84000000000003
so yeah I'm uh still

294.66 --> 298.22
kind of pissed off about that

298.62 --> 303.96
whole discussion with Rasta hat trying

301.62 --> 306.78000000000003
to explain

303.96 --> 309.35999999999996
he was basically being a on the side

306.78 --> 313.82
Diplomat which he does sometimes and

309.36 --> 313.82
but uh yeah it's it's there's no point

315.78 --> 322.25899999999996
because like it doesn't matter

319.08 --> 325.46
what Nathan was thinking it's it my

322.259 --> 325.46000000000004
issue is not about that

326.22 --> 331.62
the issue is is that he literally had no

328.8 --> 333.419
respect for the very delicate and

331.62 --> 335.039
difficult process under controlled

333.419 --> 336.35999999999996
circumstances and I was trying to

335.039 --> 338.94
unleash

336.36 --> 341.40000000000003
he literally washed over it with

338.94 --> 344.16
freaking at-homes no less and then

341.4 --> 346.44
proceeded to after I left

344.16 --> 347.759
do that some more

346.44 --> 350.82
yeah

347.759 --> 354.0
well guess what guess what Nathan yeah

350.82 --> 356.09999999999997
Baldwin yeah that's a service that's a

354.0 --> 361.199
service that I provide

356.1 --> 363.47900000000004
for free thus far yeah so how about I'm

361.199 --> 366.6
just not gonna do that anymore then

363.479 --> 368.82
since you have absolutely no respect for

366.6 --> 371.52000000000004
for my skill

368.82 --> 374.94
except when you just feel it's very

371.52 --> 376.74
convenient to praise me over it but yeah

374.94 --> 378.479
in the moment when it's actually there

376.74 --> 381.419
no no

378.479 --> 383.52
you behave poorly

381.419 --> 385.31899999999996
and then yeah I might get a little out

383.52 --> 388.31899999999996
of control and pissed off but why

385.319 --> 390.53900000000004
because you literally

388.319 --> 392.639
don't understand what it is that I'm

390.539 --> 396.259
doing in that moment

392.639 --> 400.199
and that I'm always when you allow me

396.259 --> 403.319
work to an end I'm not going to be

400.199 --> 405.78000000000003
literally rumpus just blabbering on for

403.319 --> 406.97900000000004
half an hour not leading anywhere I

405.78 --> 410.4
don't do that

406.979 --> 412.38
as Baldwin and you should know that and

410.4 --> 414.38
even though yeah it might take a little

412.38 --> 417.539
longer right it's a sophisticated

414.38 --> 418.979
sophisticated process to lay down that

417.539 --> 420.71999999999997
reasoning

418.979 --> 422.58
I mean I could just rush it and then

420.72 --> 424.8
nobody would [ __ ] understand what I'm

422.58 --> 429.479
doing and then it has absolutely no

424.8 --> 432.8
point so you're literally ruining my art

429.479 --> 436.5
that I was under the assumption

432.8 --> 439.08
is like something you've welcomed on the

436.5 --> 442.56
show well you're not showing that to me

439.08 --> 445.74
that you're welcoming it on the show by

442.56 --> 450.5
rumpusing my delicate train of thinking

445.74 --> 450.5
with ad homs no less yeah

451.74 --> 453.86
thank you

453.9 --> 459.23999999999995
I mean simply saying

456.479 --> 462.539
oh I can't can you like

459.24 --> 464.819
please I I like I want to end this like

462.539 --> 466.44
I can't handle this right now if you

464.819 --> 467.88
just say that I can't handle this right

466.44 --> 470.099
now

467.88 --> 472.68
then I would have stopped

470.099 --> 473.52
just like the previous times that

472.68 --> 476.72
happened

473.52 --> 476.71999999999997
but he didn't do that

478.68 --> 485.22
he he treated me like I was just some

482.52 --> 488.58
baller all of a sudden yeah you don't

485.22 --> 490.8
treat Boeing like he's just some baller

488.58 --> 493.68
because just some baller

490.8 --> 495.539
doesn't have the faculties they they

493.68 --> 497.759
don't know what they're talking about an

495.539 --> 499.979
anti-flat earthers they don't have the

497.759 --> 502.74
morality they don't have a social code

499.979 --> 504.0
and they'll violate anything yeah I do

502.74 --> 506.58
neither

504.0 --> 509.599
so you don't [ __ ] treat me like that

506.58 --> 509.599
you hear

509.879 --> 514.919
you don't [ __ ] treat me like that

511.74 --> 517.2
Nathan I'm done with it

514.919 --> 519.959
no more Ballwin for you

517.2 --> 523.2
you get it

519.959 --> 524.9399999999999
you can use Adam and Brian right if

523.2 --> 527.7
that's good enough for you right like

524.94 --> 529.519
they can actually do what I do it's only

527.7 --> 533.58
a poor

529.519 --> 535.86
fastim facsimile of one of my arts and

533.58 --> 539.1
you know it

535.86 --> 541.5
so if you can't handle my Arts then you

539.1 --> 543.6
don't get it yeah

541.5 --> 546.54
I'll save it for people that can

543.6 --> 549.779
actually handle it

546.54 --> 551.64
and I'll point out why this happened why

549.779 --> 553.92
all of this happened yeah it happened

551.64 --> 555.24
because you're actually kind of a shitty

553.92 --> 558.42
debater

555.24 --> 561.3
you have great argumentation but you do

558.42 --> 562.4399999999999
not have the social art of it you're too

561.3 --> 565.5
impatient

562.44 --> 568.3800000000001
you've had years of training

565.5 --> 572.959
and it seems like you haven't refined it

568.38 --> 572.959
you've only grown more intolerant

573.3 --> 581.519
to your own detriment

577.68 --> 584.279
because you can't even recognize

581.519 --> 589.2
an opponent within a discussion when

584.279 --> 589.2
they're on your side anymore apparently

593.24 --> 597.48
and I'm done with it first Baldwin was

596.459 --> 602.18
for free

597.48 --> 602.1800000000001
you want Bowen you freaking pay me

606.3 --> 613.8599999999999
yeah because when you pay me you can be

609.839 --> 615.899
sure that you can then rumpus me and

613.86 --> 619.339
ruin whenever I do because it's okay

615.899 --> 619.339
because you paid me for it

621.48 --> 625.9200000000001
right or you can actually get your

623.88 --> 628.2
money's worth out of it and then not

625.92 --> 630.4799999999999
grumpus me and treat me like [ __ ] and

628.2 --> 632.76
let me do what I do

630.48 --> 634.6800000000001
right I think that's a better deal than

632.76 --> 638.22
I just do it for free

634.68 --> 641.0999999999999
out of some friendship right and then

638.22 --> 644.0600000000001
get [ __ ] on

641.1 --> 644.0600000000001
in the moment

644.66 --> 649.16
it is pay worthy I know it is

652.44 --> 656.7600000000001
so yeah I'll hang around I think I'm

655.079 --> 657.959
gonna hang around in Discord for a while

656.76 --> 661.14
there

657.959 --> 664.579
hello by the way Rasta hat and LSG did

661.14 --> 664.579
you listen back no I didn't

666.0 --> 671.18
does Nathan pay any of the other members

668.16 --> 671.18
no no he doesn't

675.72 --> 683.519
yeah but they don't have what I have

679.8 --> 687.9799999999999
what I have is a specialist skill

683.519 --> 687.98
to an expert level that is unheard of

695.1 --> 701.5400000000001
right

697.519 --> 701.54
my point is is that

701.779 --> 706.92
it's not about oh I want some standard

704.7 --> 708.899
payment no the point is that if I'm

706.92 --> 711.36
gonna do something I want to be

708.899 --> 713.459
respected for my Arts because otherwise

711.36 --> 715.38
I'm not going to do it for free

713.459 --> 717.779
yeah

715.38 --> 720.72
I'm not going to be somebody's slave

717.779 --> 722.48
just handing over my skills and then not

720.72 --> 725.9590000000001
getting any respect

722.48 --> 725.9590000000001
not doing that

726.16 --> 729.23
[Music]

729.899 --> 734.0
yeah rest Dad

732.12 --> 738.12
that's right but

734.0 --> 741.24
Discovery and insights that's super cool

738.12 --> 743.339
that's not actually the performance like

741.24 --> 745.6800000000001
what I do

743.339 --> 748.5
and you do get credit yeah and you do

745.68 --> 750.899
not get [ __ ] upon

748.5 --> 753.38
for putting it down

750.899 --> 753.38
yeah

753.42 --> 757.92
right Rasta

755.579 --> 760.4399999999999
people do respect you they're not like

757.92 --> 763.38
talking about you all the time but

760.44 --> 767.12
they're not gonna [ __ ] on you

763.38 --> 767.12
while you do your thing

767.279 --> 771.36
unless you're like getting really

769.139 --> 773.22
attacky right but that's something

771.36 --> 776.04
that's a different issue and even then

773.22 --> 778.98
people kind of like okay resta right

776.04 --> 780.7199999999999
they respect that even though it is kind

778.98 --> 782.639
of like aberrant in a way socially

780.72 --> 785.4590000000001
doesn't matter

782.639 --> 787.32
yeah now I want the same when I do Bowen

785.459 --> 790.1389999999999
I want respect

787.32 --> 792.48
yeah I'm not some shitty anti-flat

790.139 --> 794.72
earther and I will not be treated as

792.48 --> 794.72
such

795.839 --> 798.5600000000001
thank you

800.47 --> 805.95
[Music]

806.1 --> 809.9590000000001

812.1 --> 814.4590000000001
watch back

815.1 --> 820.139
I just explained it

817.44 --> 822.72
look if you just get in here and you're

820.139 --> 825.12
gonna ask me what happened yeah well

822.72 --> 827.7
there's a good chance that you just

825.12 --> 829.5
missed that what just because you just

827.7 --> 831.9590000000001
came in you expect me to immediately

829.5 --> 833.35
repeat everything no

831.959 --> 836.5189999999999
foreign

833.35 --> 836.519
[Music]

838.339 --> 848.6
more than Brian's debate fee

842.0 --> 848.6
yeah yeah so no I mean I don't care

849.12 --> 853.92
like I'm not gonna ask five thousand

851.7 --> 856.5790000000001
pounds or something nonsensical for that

853.92 --> 856.579
right I mean

858.839 --> 864.0
it's very simple

861.24 --> 868.16
treat me with respect

864.0 --> 868.16
or pay for those services

868.44 --> 874.5600000000001
if you cannot handle yourself

871.74 --> 876.74
then you'll have to handle it by paying

874.56 --> 876.7399999999999
me

877.62 --> 883.44
right because I'm pretty damn sure that

879.899 --> 886.92
if I for example go over at flatsoids

883.44 --> 890.4200000000001
and join the panel and get all Baldwin

886.92 --> 894.24
I'm absolutely certain that flat side

890.42 --> 897.899
completely understands and respects my

894.24 --> 900.24
skill and he doesn't rumpus me yeah even

897.899 --> 902.519
when I get a little manic as well yeah

900.24 --> 906.26
because he gets it

902.519 --> 906.26
because he actually gets it

906.779 --> 912.139
right so I'm never gonna charge flat

909.36 --> 914.76
side fee for doing that because he

912.139 --> 917.36
respects it

914.76 --> 917.36
get it

922.76 --> 925.799
[Music]

926.94 --> 932.1600000000001
right but by the way

929.88 --> 934.38
none of you'll probably know that but I

932.16 --> 937.5
did actually join up on Discord

934.38 --> 939.18
yesterday and stayed after the after

937.5 --> 943.38
show was over

939.18 --> 946.1389999999999
and had a magnificent conversation

943.38 --> 948.54
with the guys there

946.139 --> 951.0600000000001
in Discord

948.54 --> 952.5
because there was this uh this this is

951.06 --> 954.959
like very

952.5 --> 957.5
careful slightly slow speaking guy again

954.959 --> 960.66
that has these really detailed questions

957.5 --> 962.399
and he asked to me about the double slit

960.66 --> 963.66
experiment and the knowing witch path

962.399 --> 966.3
yeah

963.66 --> 968.579
he wanted to ask Huey and Nathan but oh

966.3 --> 971.399
they weren't there yeah yeah so I could

968.579 --> 973.8
do it I could actually explain it to him

971.399 --> 976.92
and completely make him understand

973.8 --> 980.639
without getting angry

976.92 --> 983.54
yeah without patronizing him and making

980.639 --> 987.779
it absolutely clear without anybody

983.54 --> 992.76
[ __ ] rumpusing me while I was doing

987.779 --> 995.699
it yeah Elise G was right there

992.76 --> 998.639
weren't you LSG hello by the way

995.699 --> 1001.0999999999999
yeah that's what I can do that's my

998.639 --> 1004.339
[ __ ] skill yeah

1001.1 --> 1008.8000000000001
my skill is actually getting to the

1004.339 --> 1012.4590000000001
point and getting results and not just

1008.8 --> 1015.199
I am the best at this you cannot defeat

1012.459 --> 1017.899
yeah yeah that's really cool man that's

1015.199 --> 1019.3389999999999
really cool that you're such Bluster

1017.899 --> 1021.32
about it and that you have great

1019.339 --> 1023.12
arguments and you got guys that know

1021.32 --> 1026.839
math that's awesome yeah yeah yeah yeah

1023.12 --> 1029.6
how about the actual psychological

1026.839 --> 1033.86
warfare at hand

1029.6 --> 1036.9189999999999
and it's not going to get any less worse

1033.86 --> 1042.52
I got skills to deal with that

1036.919 --> 1042.5200000000002
and I want some freaking respect for it

1047.679 --> 1053.38
hello one big blunt

1050.72 --> 1053.38
let's see you

1058.52 --> 1061.12
all right

1061.4 --> 1064.4
foreign

1072.039 --> 1078.86
it was all pretty intense and all that

1076.46 --> 1081.559
but yeah I'm not gonna be [ __ ] upon

1078.86 --> 1084.559
like that is

1081.559 --> 1087.039
something I cannot allow myself to

1084.559 --> 1087.039
tolerate

1088.34 --> 1094.52
that everybody has moods and swings it's

1090.919 --> 1099.2800000000002
all very cool but when I apply my art

1094.52 --> 1099.28
you do not disrespect it

1100.32 --> 1107.559
[Music]

1103.22 --> 1107.559
that's where the shout out what oh

1108.559 --> 1111.8799999999999
did I give you a shout out

1112.28 --> 1117.58
I'm just saying hello to everybody in

1114.2 --> 1117.5800000000002
chat but yeah sure

1124.35 --> 1127.619
[Music]

1131.6 --> 1134.5
foreign

1137.12 --> 1142.9399999999998
look I'll settle for respect

1139.84 --> 1145.1
[Music]

1142.94 --> 1147.799
but if they can't give that

1145.1 --> 1151.039
then I want compensation

1147.799 --> 1154.039
right I mean effectively that's the same

1151.039 --> 1155.96
deal that they present anti-flat Earth

1154.039 --> 1157.82
now they're of course never gonna get

1155.96 --> 1160.16
respect and that's why the price they

1157.82 --> 1162.98
put on it is so high

1160.16 --> 1165.5
yeah I'm doing the same I'm just not

1162.98 --> 1166.82
gonna like ask 5 000 pounds are you

1165.5 --> 1169.6
crazy

1166.82 --> 1169.6
I mean

1172.9 --> 1177.74
I'll settle for 50 bucks

1175.94 --> 1178.8200000000002
or something

1177.74 --> 1181.34
right

1178.82 --> 1183.86
you can get full bowling and everything

1181.34 --> 1186.8799999999999
you want

1183.86 --> 1186.8799999999999
for like an hour

1188.24 --> 1192.919
now get as exhaustive and as humiliated

1191.12 --> 1196.2199999999998
as you like

1192.919 --> 1197.48
and that fee is exclusively to Nathan by

1196.22 --> 1199.46
the way

1197.48 --> 1201.74
because that doesn't mean we're going to

1199.46 --> 1204.559
do that for 50 bucks and like for it to

1201.74 --> 1207.799
Florida Earth or something right

1204.559 --> 1209.36
yes like like by the way why the hell

1207.799 --> 1212.299
would I even be borrowing on that but

1209.36 --> 1214.78
that's a different scenario

1212.299 --> 1214.78
right

1217.46 --> 1224.0
does it come with a shutoff switch

1220.46 --> 1226.6000000000001
yes yes it does

1224.0 --> 1226.6
foreign

1230.059 --> 1234.62
shout out unconditionally no

1233.24 --> 1238.0
distractions

1234.62 --> 1238.0
I can't take this right now

1238.22 --> 1243.32
and I stop

1240.919 --> 1245.179
every time Nathan has said that clearly

1243.32 --> 1247.52
not being over talked so that I couldn't

1245.179 --> 1251.179
hear but when he clearly said that

1247.52 --> 1253.4
he meant it I stopped

1251.179 --> 1256.7
because then I know oh [ __ ] I'm

1253.4 --> 1258.3200000000002
overloading him he can't handle it right

1256.7 --> 1260.179
fine

1258.32 --> 1261.74
if you can't handle it is no point in

1260.179 --> 1266.179
continuing

1261.74 --> 1269.48
but if he somehow gets deluded by what I

1266.179 --> 1272.96
do starts projecting an anti-flat

1269.48 --> 1277.0
earther over me for real

1272.96 --> 1277.0
then there's no excuse

1281.12 --> 1284.86
then he's become deluded by it

1291.14 --> 1296.0590000000002
foreign

1293.9 --> 1299.179
they don't like me around on the show

1296.059 --> 1301.22
right well sometimes

1299.179 --> 1303.5590000000002
I don't know

1301.22 --> 1305.96
I don't know what's going on over at fed

1303.559 --> 1308.12
I get a lot of very snarkiness

1305.96 --> 1311.919
now these days

1308.12 --> 1311.9189999999999
so maybe they don't like me anymore

1313.88 --> 1316.659
I don't know

1317.539 --> 1322.82
I'm not entirely certain as to what is

1320.12 --> 1324.08
going on it's just that I'm not gonna be

1322.82 --> 1327.3799999999999
this

1324.08 --> 1329.8999999999999
yeah this guy that's gonna be

1327.38 --> 1332.659
like super

1329.9 --> 1333.8600000000001
timid or something like that I can't do

1332.659 --> 1336.0200000000002
that

1333.86 --> 1338.07
I have Bluster

1336.02 --> 1339.5
it's a natural part of me

1338.07 --> 1343.22
[Music]

1339.5 --> 1345.799
is what keeps me alive damn it

1343.22 --> 1348.76
and I have emotions and when I'm pissed

1345.799 --> 1348.76
off I'm gonna be loud

1349.1 --> 1353.6789999999999
but I'm also verily easily

1353.72 --> 1359.1200000000001
helped

1355.34 --> 1360.97
all I need is some recognition

1359.12 --> 1365.2399999999998
and then I can move on

1360.97 --> 1367.82
[Music]

1365.24 --> 1371.78
yeah and just like all the other guys

1367.82 --> 1374.36
they do it too they do it too

1371.78 --> 1377.12
and and not everybody starts piking up

1374.36 --> 1379.34
like oh again now damn it Brian why you

1377.12 --> 1382.28
have to be like this chocolate and tenth

1379.34 --> 1384.799
man and Adam now they don't do that they

1382.28 --> 1387.6789999999999
don't do that with the others

1384.799 --> 1389.9
they do it with me

1387.679 --> 1393.0800000000002
I'm kind of sick of that

1389.9 --> 1396.38
yeah how about you don't all just

1393.08 --> 1399.1999999999998
automatically turn against me when I'm

1396.38 --> 1402.98
get pissed off about something how about

1399.2 --> 1406.9
that how about you don't all per default

1402.98 --> 1406.9
start turning against me

1412.37 --> 1415.51
[Music]

1417.44 --> 1422.26
ah

1419.48 --> 1422.26
what

1424.88 --> 1431.5390000000002
I think you should do my own debate show

1428.0 --> 1434.74
maybe I mean if this never stops if this

1431.539 --> 1434.74
is not gonna be helped

1435.08 --> 1440.78
and I basically disconnect from fed

1438.2 --> 1443.96
because that can happen I don't want to

1440.78 --> 1447.1399999999999
I want to continue on

1443.96 --> 1450.919
but it has to change the attitude has to

1447.14 --> 1454.159
change from their side

1450.919 --> 1458.5
and they should realize that

1454.159 --> 1458.5
that I am not unreasonable

1459.62 --> 1468.52
and you shouldn't treat me like I am

1464.48 --> 1468.52
because I'm not unreasonable

1479.39 --> 1485.2990000000002
[Music]

1482.36 --> 1487.8799999999999
to lose me for the drama I don't know if

1485.299 --> 1490.52
that is the case then then I'm really

1487.88 --> 1493.46
done with it if that is the case then

1490.52 --> 1496.1
I'm out of there if it's just for

1493.46 --> 1498.679
creating drama well then they can go

1496.1 --> 1500.6
[ __ ] themselves but you go find some

1498.679 --> 1502.94
other drama

1500.6 --> 1506.78
what if that is the case then they're

1502.94 --> 1510.76
literally spiritually vampiring on me

1506.78 --> 1510.76
so let's hope that's not the case

1518.84 --> 1524.48
oh

1520.78 --> 1526.22
I don't know who they are

1524.48 --> 1530.679
who are they

1526.22 --> 1530.679
diver Den Navy vets

1530.84 --> 1535.8999999999999
I have no idea who that is

1533.179 --> 1535.9
those people

1541.039 --> 1548.679
spiritual vampiring hahaha I love it you

1544.7 --> 1548.679
think that's funny that's not funny

1548.9 --> 1554.1200000000001
it's a terrible habit

1551.059 --> 1557.059
but not surprising

1554.12 --> 1560.6
because if you're gonna keep cracking

1557.059 --> 1563.4189999999999
and focusing in on anti-flat earthers to

1560.6 --> 1567.1999999999998
defeat them your their tricks are gonna

1563.419 --> 1570.679
rub off on you their vampiric spiritual

1567.2 --> 1573.559
hunger is gonna rub off on you

1570.679 --> 1577.0590000000002
if you don't take care of that

1573.559 --> 1577.059
you become them

1577.58 --> 1581.6789999999999
and you won't even realize it

1582.679 --> 1586.24
yeah foreign

1592.96 --> 1598.0
spiritual vaping for a moment there

1595.46 --> 1598.0
anyway

1602.98 --> 1607.9
is that some comedy series I don't know

1608.539 --> 1614.299
all right I'm glad you're enjoying it so

1611.48 --> 1615.44
much Aries 106. good to think it's so

1614.299 --> 1619.24
funny

1615.44 --> 1619.24
you know I don't think this is funny

1621.35 --> 1625.7099999999998
[Music]

1627.08 --> 1632.02
okay arrest that that's enough it's

1629.0 --> 1632.02
getting kind of gay now

1639.799 --> 1646.58
you still really still to know what

1645.11 --> 1649.24
[Music]

1646.58 --> 1649.24
dude

1649.7 --> 1657.919
I mean Bob and Jaren are much worse

1654.86 --> 1660.74
those guys are like

1657.919 --> 1663.74
real serious egomaniacs in their way

1660.74 --> 1668.44
like there's no way

1663.74 --> 1668.44
I would ever like connect up with them

1670.22 --> 1675.44
I mean the freaking first time I even

1672.26 --> 1677.6589999999999
met Jaren he acted like a dick to me

1675.44 --> 1679.279
face to face

1677.659 --> 1682.2990000000002
like a dick

1679.279 --> 1686.02
and that was way before any weird

1682.299 --> 1686.02
friction even happened

1689.6 --> 1693.52
in 2019

1691.52 --> 1693.52
.

1701.179 --> 1706.5800000000002
what do I think about Mark Sargent I

1703.22 --> 1708.8600000000001
think Mark Sargent Is A very wise

1706.58 --> 1711.08
man

1708.86 --> 1714.5
who's really a flat earther

1711.08 --> 1717.26
but also knows that the field is

1714.5 --> 1721.46
absolutely screwed by default and he

1717.26 --> 1727.46
literally announced this in 2015. the

1721.46 --> 1732.039
guy had like amazing foresight in 2015.

1727.46 --> 1736.039
he really put down so much so early

1732.039 --> 1738.26
psychological by social wise

1736.039 --> 1741.2
and I appreciate Mark Sergeant I mean

1738.26 --> 1743.299
I'm not super interested in his videos

1741.2 --> 1746.419
but I like the guy

1743.299 --> 1748.1589999999999
I think he's a complex character with

1746.419 --> 1749.779
with some dark side that he deals with

1748.159 --> 1753.0800000000002
but

1749.779 --> 1756.74
he's really a good guy

1753.08 --> 1760.96
I mean he's never really cited

1756.74 --> 1760.96
with a with something really bad

1763.1 --> 1765.4599999999998
right

1765.5 --> 1770.179
[Music]

1767.72 --> 1772.58

Netherlands right now Alexander Swedish

1777.919 --> 1784.24

1780.74 --> 1784.24
mean he still keeps uploading videos

1785.72 --> 1792.32
he's like super busy organizing I think

1788.899 --> 1794.84
a lot of like Flat Earth meetups because

1792.32 --> 1800.08
that's typically the videos he posts

1794.84 --> 1800.08
about new meetups so he's busy with that

1806.059 --> 1810.74
team frequency radio stop paying the

1808.399 --> 1812.12

2160.0 --> 2165.28

2162.76 --> 2167.8
very clear that she just hates

2165.28 --> 2172.0
infighting nonsense and

2167.8 --> 2175.2000000000003
it hasn't really gone away now has it

hasn't at all

2188.079 --> 2194.32
went after Benjamin paulerson

2191.22 --> 2197.859

2194.32 --> 2200.92
that Karen B just has

2197.859 --> 2204.16
a personal allergy against you

2200.92 --> 2206.6800000000003

2216.46 --> 2221.28
you get on my nerves as well so

2222.94 --> 2227.92
that's to me several years yeah until

2225.04 --> 2230.859
you start going after people

2227.92 --> 2232.42
which you didn't really do at first and

2230.859 --> 2234.16

like a big form of financing or

2290.859 --> 2295.06
something

he went to the dark side he literally

2404.02 --> 2408.82
like on private talks back then tried to

tell me

made videos about that and just he went

completely like bad

mainstream and then he started defending

2428.92 --> 2434.619
the ball and but it just

2432.099 --> 2436.42
eventually it kind of fizzled and got

2434.619 --> 2438.82
miserable it didn't work out the way he

2436.42 --> 2442.599
thought it would then started doing like

never ever used it again

like traded it in again

more then I guess Presta

2617.98 --> 2620.46
all right

really use it a lot

2661.119 --> 2663.78
barely

2664.359 --> 2668.2

2666.22 --> 2672.64
great with a camera

2668.2 --> 2675.3999999999996
and like the battery is just ugh

2672.64 --> 2678.0989999999997
the thing is I would require well first

2675.4 --> 2682.619
off like serious interest and then some

2678.099 --> 2682.619
money to basically get it going again

2684.16 --> 2689.2599999999998

2688.0 --> 2693.04
yeah

2715.839 --> 2718.5
I don't know

2719.98 --> 2726.339

2723.46 --> 2726.63

2989.5 --> 2995.56
visually then that means it's there

2992.26 --> 2998.5
visually you can see something

2995.56 --> 3001.98
not denying that there's comets that can

2998.5 --> 3007.099
be seen just denying the claimed

3001.98 --> 3007.099
heliocentric explanation of what it is

3007.56 --> 3016.94
to comments fall from the club what no

3012.72 --> 3016.9399999999996
what a ridiculous statement is this

3018.72 --> 3023.819
are you an anti-flat earther posing like

3021.66 --> 3026.96
a flat earther I mean these are really

3023.819 --> 3026.96
dumb statements

3038.78 --> 3044.7000000000003
foreign

3041.24 --> 3049.14
is it's a freaking light

3044.7 --> 3052.74
it's a weird hazy little light

3049.14 --> 3055.98
and sometimes it's there

3052.74 --> 3057.9599999999996
and then it isn't anymore

3055.98 --> 3060.72
yeah it's a light like all the

3057.96 --> 3063.66
celestials lights

3060.72 --> 3067.319
not a light bulb

3063.66 --> 3072.5
or some burning plasma no light just

3067.319 --> 3072.5
light holographic including comets

3073.92 --> 3078.7200000000003
yeah there's no comment

3076.319 --> 3080.88
but it's getting closer oh we can see it

3078.72 --> 3084.0589999999997
getting closer so close oh there's all

3080.88 --> 3086.2200000000003
this water coming down no that's never

3084.059 --> 3089.4
happens never even been described that

3086.22 --> 3090.5989999999997
only happens in disaster sci-fi Globe

3089.4 --> 3091.7400000000002
movies

3090.599 --> 3095.579
yeah

3091.74 --> 3096.4799999999996
it's a weird fuzzy light

3095.579 --> 3098.2200000000003
that's what it is

3096.48 --> 3101.78
[Music]

3098.22 --> 3101.7799999999997
there is no space

3104.339 --> 3109.619
it's a light

3106.2 --> 3113.5789999999997
it's a holographic light does not have a

3109.619 --> 3116.7000000000003
literal location within 3D space

3113.579 --> 3119.0
it's holographic it

3116.7 --> 3122.16
is visible at the edge of your vision

3119.0 --> 3126.54
unless something is in between that edge

3122.16 --> 3129.66
of your vision physically obstructing it

3126.54 --> 3132.96
it's presented like a demi sphere

3129.66 --> 3135.35
hologram that surrounds you and that you

3132.96 --> 3138.55
can never reach

3135.35 --> 3138.5499999999997
[Music]

3141.3 --> 3145.4
real holographic it's not man-made

3144.42 --> 3148.859
device

3145.4 --> 3150.9
holographic is the closest description

3148.859 --> 3154.14
Association

3150.9 --> 3156.119
that I can find a try to explain what it

3154.14 --> 3158.04
is because I don't really know I just

3156.119 --> 3161.579
know it's definitely not physical

3158.04 --> 3164.64
objects in physical literal positions

3161.579 --> 3167.52
that I am pretty damn sure about

3164.64 --> 3169.74
through inference though because there's

3167.52 --> 3171.119
absolutely no evidence that they are

3169.74 --> 3175.52
whatsoever

3171.119 --> 3179.4
none whatsoever just a bunch of angular

3175.52 --> 3180.72
lineups based on presuppositions of the

3179.4 --> 3183.059
Earth's surface

3180.72 --> 3185.4599999999996
well it lines up all the angles line up

3183.059 --> 3186.9
well it must be there then based on the

3185.46 --> 3188.52
Assumption of what the shape I'm

3186.9 --> 3191.04
standing on is

3188.52 --> 3193.64
yeah we know yeah but it isn't actually

3191.04 --> 3196.2
there when you then go to that location

3193.64 --> 3198.1189999999997
or even attempt to approach oh guess

3196.2 --> 3200.5789999999997
what it goes away or you don't actually

3198.119 --> 3203.46
approach it doesn't become bigger

3200.579 --> 3205.079
because you're like bigger right bigger

3203.46 --> 3207.18
it becomes bigger it doesn't happen

3205.079 --> 3209.819
because you're not approaching an object

3207.18 --> 3213.359
it's just a light at an angular position

3209.819 --> 3215.7599999999998
and it moves with you virtually

3213.359 --> 3219.319
because it's a hologram and it moves

3215.76 --> 3219.3190000000004
with you like a hologram

3232.559 --> 3238.26
and comets are part of that

3235.68 --> 3242.339
there's no evidence whatsoever that it

3238.26 --> 3246.44
is even associated with water

3242.339 --> 3246.44
it's a proof that there's water involved

3246.66 --> 3249.66
foreign

3262.339 --> 3266.24
are you blabbering about

3266.76 --> 3269.9
poor [ __ ]

3272.24 --> 3278.4599999999996
comments dude get the [ __ ] out I'm gonna

3275.22 --> 3281.7599999999998
kick you out you're a liar

3278.46 --> 3285.26
it's the dumbest story anybody ever

3281.76 --> 3285.26
tried to make up in my chat

3285.78 --> 3291.5400000000004
comets crashing into cars right you've

3289.5 --> 3293.16
been watching too many stupid disaster

3291.54 --> 3295.859
movies dude

3293.16 --> 3298.44
that's really dumb thing to say

3295.859 --> 3301.5589999999997
yeah comets don't reach the freaking

3298.44 --> 3304.26
surface like

3301.559 --> 3307.92
it just moves by at a distance that's

3304.26 --> 3310.98
all they ever do there's no record of a

3307.92 --> 3312.2400000000002
combat becoming so large it's taking up

3310.98 --> 3314.64
a giant

3312.24 --> 3318.4199999999996
part of the sky angular wise because

3314.64 --> 3320.339
it's getting close no never ever that's

3318.42 --> 3322.859
never happened

3320.339 --> 3326.819
so stop making up [ __ ]

3322.859 --> 3328.5
like comets crashing into cars I mean

3326.819 --> 3331.22
[ __ ] off dude

3328.5 --> 3331.22
[ __ ] off

3336.48 --> 3340.8
let's meet you right yeah that's claimed

3338.76 --> 3343.88
with meteorites no proof of that either

3340.8 --> 3343.88
at all

3345.2 --> 3352.04
right very even but at least with

3348.599 --> 3354.48
meteorites within the presumed

3352.04 --> 3357.48
presuppositional heliocentric cosmology

3354.48 --> 3359.64
yeah that could happen with meteorites

3357.48 --> 3362.22
it can't even happen

3359.64 --> 3365.5789999999997
with freaking comments

3362.22 --> 3367.98
because they're going to be Molten

3365.579 --> 3372.02
before they would theoretically even

3367.98 --> 3374.4
reach the Earth it's a ridiculous notion

3372.02 --> 3376.8
all they would do is just dump a bunch

3374.4 --> 3379.6800000000003
of water in the atmosphere

3376.8 --> 3382.2200000000003
if it would happen which it doesn't has

3379.68 --> 3382.22
never happened

3385.98 --> 3390.839
you believe in it yeah it seems so sorry

3389.28 --> 3393.48
if I'm being rough on you but you're

3390.839 --> 3396.42
just saying stupid things and we're kind

3393.48 --> 3398.4
of suspicious of that because a lot of

3396.42 --> 3400.6800000000003
the time that's actually anti-flat

3398.4 --> 3402.48
earthers making soccer counts pretending

3400.68 --> 3404.52
to be a flat earther and then like

3402.48 --> 3406.319
hahaha I'm gonna say really stupid

3404.52 --> 3409.14
things as a flat Earth and see if they

3406.319 --> 3410.52
go along with me yeah yeah we we know

3409.14 --> 3412.92
that trick

3410.52 --> 3415.02
that's why we're very suspicious of Flat

3412.92 --> 3417.44
Earth or saying really stupid things

3415.02 --> 3417.44
like that

3417.599 --> 3421.98
you're saying oh then no that's just an

3420.119 --> 3425.6600000000003
honest mistake I didn't really think

3421.98 --> 3425.66
about it then that's fine

3426.72 --> 3431.819
his account was just me yeah sure the

3429.54 --> 3433.2
point is is that at this point it

3431.819 --> 3434.64
doesn't matter whether you are an

3433.2 --> 3436.7999999999997
anti-flight or if they're pretending to

3434.64 --> 3439.2599999999998
be a flat earther because I'm gonna call

3436.8 --> 3440.52
you out within your character for your

3439.26 --> 3443.76
[ __ ]

3440.52 --> 3445.68
and then put down the right explanation

3443.76 --> 3447.5400000000004
so to me it doesn't matter where you're

3445.68 --> 3449.46
at whether you're actually an anti-flat

3447.54 --> 3450.599
earth or undercover or just genuinely a

3449.46 --> 3452.64
flat earther

3450.599 --> 3454.559
that's kind of uninformed doesn't matter

3452.64 --> 3456.96
to me because I'm I'm still going to be

3454.559 --> 3459.8390000000004
able to handle it because

3456.96 --> 3461.88
it's not that relevant to me at this

3459.839 --> 3463.74
point whether you're an anti-flatter

3461.88 --> 3466.619
through Undercover

3463.74 --> 3467.819
I'm just gonna respond to the

3466.619 --> 3469.46
communication

3467.819 --> 3472.319
anyway

3469.46 --> 3474.059
here is only Celestial lights that's

3472.319 --> 3476.339
right no there's no Celestial lights

3474.059 --> 3479.0400000000004
that transform into physical objects

3476.339 --> 3482.0589999999997
that's nonsense

3479.04 --> 3482.0589999999997
it's holographic

3483.72 --> 3489.5989999999997
right but yeah meteors are a little

3486.66 --> 3492.0
complicated because well

3489.599 --> 3495.1800000000003
there's a lot more indication that there

3492.0 --> 3497.4
is literal physical meteor activity or

3495.18 --> 3501.18
what we would associate with such and

3497.4 --> 3504.359
that well makes the mystery a lot bigger

3501.18 --> 3506.16
because that separates meteors

3504.359 --> 3507.7799999999997
from the celestials which is purely

3506.16 --> 3509.94
holographic

3507.78 --> 3513.48
so yeah that's weird I don't understand

3509.94 --> 3515.2200000000003
I don't exactly know about meteors but

3513.48 --> 3516.599
they are an exception because well

3515.22 --> 3519.54
there's

3516.599 --> 3521.819
sites and I've literally seen it live

3519.54 --> 3524.04
with my own eyes in the physical world

3521.819 --> 3526.74
like meteors

3524.04 --> 3529.92
coming down right in front of me

3526.74 --> 3533.339
very close that's so weird about so

3529.92 --> 3538.98
close and literally hearing the glitter

3533.339 --> 3540.44
the crackling of it like fireworks

3538.98 --> 3543.66
foreign

3540.44 --> 3545.76
so that's not Celestial activity that's

3543.66 --> 3547.92
something that's a physical thing and I

3545.76 --> 3550.3190000000004
don't know I don't it doesn't connect to

3547.92 --> 3552.7200000000003
the celestials but I don't exactly know

3550.319 --> 3555.119
how the hell that why where's that

3552.72 --> 3557.52
coming from how's that possible I mean

3555.119 --> 3559.38
is there like yeah it opens up the whole

3557.52 --> 3561.48
meteor situation I've done multiple

3559.38 --> 3563.96
Hangouts about that

3561.48 --> 3563.96
right

3564.839 --> 3569.22
multiple shows about meteors including

3567.42 --> 3571.14
one very early one that's been very

3569.22 --> 3572.7
popular by the way a lot of people have

3571.14 --> 3574.5589999999997
this question like what the hell is that

3572.7 --> 3577.0789999999997
like

3574.559 --> 3579.299
I mean to understand like oh the

3577.079 --> 3581.46
celestial lights are holographic is

3579.299 --> 3583.38
actually easier

3581.46 --> 3587.299
than to figure out what the [ __ ]

3583.38 --> 3590.2200000000003
meteorites are okay

3587.299 --> 3591.96
because that one is just really bizarre

3590.22 --> 3595.0789999999997
and mysterious like where is it coming

3591.96 --> 3597.38
from where's the physical stuff coming

3595.079 --> 3597.38
from

3599.64 --> 3606.0589999999997
is it somehow naturally formed in a

3603.18 --> 3609.0589999999997
cycle like is it like plaque building up

3606.059 --> 3612.2400000000002
there against the Dome or the

3609.059 --> 3614.579
the barrier and does it then fall off

3612.24 --> 3615.72
again like what is happening how is this

3614.579 --> 3618.0
material

3615.72 --> 3620.359
every now and then just coming down all

3618.0 --> 3620.359
of a sudden

3620.76 --> 3626.4
where's it coming from right that's a

3623.22 --> 3629.3999999999996
big mystery and I do not just have the

3626.4 --> 3632.28
answer for that I have ideas about it

3629.4 --> 3633.54
several ideas that I've laid out in the

3632.28 --> 3635.7000000000003
past

3633.54 --> 3637.619
but I don't know I don't know with

3635.7 --> 3639.839
certainty

3637.619 --> 3641.88
but I do know with absolute certainty

3639.839 --> 3645.54
that they are physical because I've

3641.88 --> 3649.94
literally witnessed it in person

3645.54 --> 3649.94
with my own eyes in the waking world

3663.0 --> 3670.7
we got Ken trailing planes dropping them

3668.04 --> 3670.7
what

3671.54 --> 3675.68
what the [ __ ] bro

3678.0 --> 3681.2
are you serious

3681.299 --> 3687.119
that is insane the bed of Dr Bass

3684.24 --> 3689.299
awkward that is really that's pretty out

3687.119 --> 3689.299
there

3689.96 --> 3695.7
I mean what

3692.16 --> 3699.359
a drop metal balls out of planes for

3695.7 --> 3703.02
meteorites well how then were there

3699.359 --> 3705.0
meteorites way before there are planes I

3703.02 --> 3707.16
mean in the past that they go around in

3705.0 --> 3709.52
balloons and drop them that I mean what

3707.16 --> 3709.52
the [ __ ]

3712.5 --> 3715.5
foreign

3718.64 --> 3723.02
no

3720.24 --> 3723.02
[ __ ]

3723.72 --> 3727.4599999999996
can damage the firmament

3727.98 --> 3732.119
bizarre

3730.44 --> 3733.859
I think if you're going to go by that

3732.119 --> 3735.599
it's more likely that there's somehow

3733.859 --> 3737.819
plaque building up

3735.599 --> 3742.099
that is the material of the meteor I've

3737.819 --> 3744.9
concluded that well I could imagine a

3742.099 --> 3746.48
transmutation process where the super

3744.9 --> 3749.819
thin

3746.48 --> 3752.64
gases of helium and hydrogen which are

3749.819 --> 3754.74
going to be predominantly up there in

3752.64 --> 3755.94
relation to the other gases because they

3754.74 --> 3758.18
are the lightest

3755.94 --> 3761.52
and maybe there's something electric

3758.18 --> 3765.0589999999997
somehow transmuting it like literally

3761.52 --> 3767.46
the gas sparsely would touch

3765.059 --> 3768.599
the top and then like as soon as it

3767.46 --> 3772.5
touches

3768.599 --> 3775.579
it transforms like into meteorite plaque

3772.5 --> 3778.5
and then over time if enough of that is

3775.579 --> 3781.559
and then eventually it'll just like form

3778.5 --> 3784.2
this stuff and that could then break off

3781.559 --> 3786.9
and then like even be

3784.2 --> 3788.8799999999997
like through the electric effect because

3786.9 --> 3790.6800000000003
transmutation happens through electric

3788.88 --> 3792.78
effects

3790.68 --> 3794.5789999999997
that it would be bolted off and that

3792.78 --> 3798.48
would explain some of the meatier or

3794.579 --> 3800.04
excitings right that's an idea

3798.48 --> 3803.94
that's my

3800.04 --> 3806.16
go-to idea really that I think is the

3803.94 --> 3807.7200000000003
most likely of these the the ideas that

3806.16 --> 3810.0589999999997
I've had about it

3807.72 --> 3812.9399999999996
right but but like I've never heard of

3810.059 --> 3815.46
like oh they're just meteorites are are

3812.94 --> 3819.299
just metal spheres that they drop out of

3815.46 --> 3822.059
airplanes like what the [ __ ] that's new

3819.299 --> 3823.98
it sounds really silly

3822.059 --> 3825.8390000000004
never even thought of something like

3823.98 --> 3828.599
that I mean I've had the idea that they

3825.839 --> 3831.319
catapult it I mean catapults have been

3828.599 --> 3831.319
around forever

3831.9 --> 3836.94
and magnets

3834.18 --> 3839.339
have been a lot around a lot longer than

3836.94 --> 3841.2000000000003
the plane so yeah maybe like a magnetic

3839.339 --> 3844.44
gun that's just like oh take this metal

3841.2 --> 3846.54
sphere and then we just boom

3844.44 --> 3847.68
from all the other side of the world and

3846.54 --> 3850.44
they can Aid him and they're just like

3847.68 --> 3853.2599999999998
yeah it's gonna then eventually

3850.44 --> 3855.44
start electrically burning and then it's

3853.26 --> 3859.26
and then they have their meteor but like

3855.44 --> 3863.78
why why the [ __ ] would you even do that

3859.26 --> 3863.78
as humans like it makes no sense

3863.819 --> 3867.68
and dropping it out of balloon

3868.68 --> 3876.319
and then airplane is even sillier like

3871.98 --> 3876.319
why why the [ __ ] would you do that

3877.2 --> 3881.8799999999997
makes no sense what's the point of doing

3880.02 --> 3883.5
that

3881.88 --> 3885.0
anyway

3883.5 --> 3887.18
all right hope you're all enjoying the

3885.0 --> 3887.18
show

3887.82 --> 3894.02
[Music]

3890.099 --> 3894.02
I'm Gonna Keep it going for a while

3896.339 --> 3899.0
foreign

3911.819 --> 3916.02
now the idea was is that look

3913.98 --> 3917.64
transmutation

3916.02 --> 3919.319
if it's gonna happen naturally it's

3917.64 --> 3922.799
going to be Electric

3919.319 --> 3924.54
right at the at the top and then well if

3922.799 --> 3927.44
there's electricity that also means

3924.54 --> 3927.44
there can be like

3928.22 --> 3931.4599999999996
repelling effect

3933.9 --> 3938.04
so yeah I mean it can very much imagine

3936.18 --> 3940.6189999999997
that it's just like plaque building up

3938.04 --> 3942.42
but that it actually the material was

3940.619 --> 3944.1600000000003
going to be hyper dense compared to

3942.42 --> 3946.5
everything that surrounds an enemy and

3944.16 --> 3949.2599999999998
hyper dance it was it will probably

3946.5 --> 3951.96
really want to go down a lot

3949.26 --> 3954.5400000000004
it can't because it's stuck but yeah it

3951.96 --> 3956.2200000000003
might be vibrating slightly I mean if

3954.54 --> 3960.0
it's electric there could be all kinds

3956.22 --> 3960.0
of unexpected vibrations

3961.079 --> 3966.78
right something electrified with objects

3963.72 --> 3969.1189999999997
against it the weird thing can happen

3966.78 --> 3972.119
and then yeah as soon as something would

3969.119 --> 3975.6600000000003
break loose like the piece would be like

3972.119 --> 3978.059
eroded ground right fractures everywhere

3975.66 --> 3979.44
so there's like little black soil that

3978.059 --> 3982.2000000000003
could then

3979.44 --> 3985.319
at the ceiling get stuck and then like

3982.2 --> 3988.0789999999997
crack loose and suddenly it's loose and

3985.319 --> 3990.0
then it gets magnetically launched

3988.079 --> 3992.28
downwards with great speed because it

3990.0 --> 3994.799
always was going to get pushed down

3992.28 --> 3996.48
magnetically and want to go down

3994.799 --> 3999.66
naturally because of relative density

3996.48 --> 4002.839
and then as soon it breaks loose it just

3999.66 --> 4006.68
bolts down with Mac extreme speed might

4002.839 --> 4009.319
even just by getting loose ignite it

4006.68 --> 4012.74
through the electricity

4009.319 --> 4016.42
something like that I'm

4012.74 --> 4016.4199999999996
trying to figure it out

4016.46 --> 4020.7200000000003
I'm just going by what intuitively makes

4019.52 --> 4021.859
sense somehow

4020.72 --> 4023.8999999999996
[Music]

4021.859 --> 4027.88
right this is the closest that I can get

4023.9 --> 4027.88
to explaining some of these sightings

4039.14 --> 4046.24
what hello Dusty Flint gravel spawn I

4043.28 --> 4046.2400000000002
could see you it's been a while

4048.26 --> 4053.5
I should do this more often there's a

4050.119 --> 4053.5
lot of people here in chat right now

4067.52 --> 4073.78
are you enjoying the show

4069.319 --> 4073.7799999999997
yeah later with artist you are I guess

4087.98 --> 4093.14
what what

4090.16 --> 4096.0199999999995
is that's a weird question there skeptic

4093.14 --> 4100.179
I mean Flat Earth doesn't understand I I

4096.02 --> 4100.179
don't get it either what

4100.46 --> 4106.819
NP life apologist and La Puta mechanics

4105.14 --> 4109.54
what

4106.819 --> 4109.54
okay

4110.9 --> 4116.98
Thunder fly physics

4114.08 --> 4116.98
what do you mean

4120.679 --> 4126.02
you mean what I'm doing trying yeah but

4123.44 --> 4128.839
when I'm doing that I'm just like trying

4126.02 --> 4131.900000000001
to describe processes based on things

4128.839 --> 4134.42
that I've seen are possible so it is a

4131.9 --> 4136.179
lot of it is estimation based because I

4134.42 --> 4139.779
do not truly understand

4136.179 --> 4139.779
electrics like that

4140.299 --> 4145.2789999999995
but I just like with programming like I

4143.06 --> 4148.04
mean I I don't know how to program but I

4145.279 --> 4151.52
get how programming Works fundamentally

4148.04 --> 4153.62
I understand that part

4151.52 --> 4155.6
right

4153.62 --> 4157.58
and the same kind of goes for electrics

4155.6 --> 4160.04
I mean I've seen a lot

4157.58 --> 4161.239
I've heard a lot of [ __ ] about it as

4160.04 --> 4163.2789999999995
well

4161.239 --> 4166.16
and that's why I'm just like purely

4163.279 --> 4168.799000000001
going by what I've seen is possible and

4166.16 --> 4170.54
then like just don't let people tell you

4168.799 --> 4174.56
what that's supposed to be and what

4170.54 --> 4178.46
right just know what is possible see it

4174.56 --> 4179.839000000001
and then use that intuition memory

4178.46 --> 4183.08
because that is the thing that's

4179.839 --> 4184.64
possible somehow

4183.08 --> 4187.2789999999995
right and then you just put things

4184.64 --> 4191.5
together and then hopefully at some

4187.279 --> 4191.5
point the pieces will just fall in place

4191.859 --> 4195.029
[Music]

4196.16 --> 4199.82
it's how I've done a lot of like

4198.44 --> 4203.32
well

4199.82 --> 4203.32
Flat Earth cosmology

4204.08 --> 4210.5
speculation how to figure out

4207.62 --> 4212.12
what could be possible I do it based on

4210.5 --> 4214.87
that just

4212.12 --> 4218.12
anyway

4214.87 --> 4218.12
[Music]

4219.159 --> 4222.699
compile comments

4223.1 --> 4225.6990000000005
okay

4239.96 --> 4244.46
yeah Pro Camera and it's like

4243.32 --> 4247.179
oh

4244.46 --> 4247.179
okay

4249.8 --> 4253.659000000001
really

4251.12 --> 4253.659
huh

4260.54 --> 4265.28
hey Stellian 8012

4263.54 --> 4268.96
yeah it's been a while

4265.28 --> 4268.96
um I'm doing yeah I'm doing okay and

4271.55 --> 4274.88
[Music]

4273.92 --> 4277.9400000000005
okay

4274.88 --> 4281.179
I'm sort of taking a break from fed

4277.94 --> 4283.5199999999995
Since the situation yesterday so I'm

4281.179 --> 4286.159
just keeping going right now until I

4283.52 --> 4287.719
feel like I should stop

4286.159 --> 4289.74
now let's start it very late today

4287.719 --> 4292.939
anyway

4289.74 --> 4292.938999999999
[Music]

4296.1 --> 4299.819
[Music]

4302.22 --> 4308.4800000000005
[Music]

4305.48 --> 4308.48
foreign

4310.76 --> 4315.919
[Music]

4337.34 --> 4340.179
uh

4359.3 --> 4364.900000000001
doing great okay go to you

4362.36 --> 4368.9
I mean

4364.9 --> 4370.219
uh development wise I'm doing pretty

4368.9 --> 4375.5
damn good

4370.219 --> 4377.9
Financial wise however not so great

4375.5 --> 4380.84
and yeah people

4377.9 --> 4381.739
been made plenty aware about that on my

4380.84 --> 4383.4400000000005
show

4381.739 --> 4386.9
I think

4383.44 --> 4388.759999999999
but yeah I mean I apparently getting by

4386.9 --> 4392.48
and is mostly because of the support

4388.76 --> 4394.159000000001
through you guys even though some of you

4392.48 --> 4396.379999999999
are literally in your own financial

4394.159 --> 4398.659
problems because it's yeah it's the

4396.38 --> 4399.679
freaking world man end the season on top

4398.659 --> 4402.4
of that

4399.679 --> 4402.4
so

4403.04 --> 4410.719
but like some scraps here and there I I

4408.08 --> 4414.38
can survive this but it has to keep

4410.719 --> 4416.9
flowing so please do support me through

4414.38 --> 4418.88
the PayPal specifically that works the

4416.9 --> 4422.379999999999
best the quickest

4418.88 --> 4422.38
and takes the least toll

4422.84 --> 4429.159000000001
I'm not on fpd today no

4426.02 --> 4429.159000000001
I didn't feel like it

4430.82 --> 4436.88
I might go on in discard after a while

4434.12 --> 4441.58
but uh no I I don't see any point

4436.88 --> 4441.58
showing up uh in the G Plus panel

4456.98 --> 4460.78
your cats are there oh cool

4464.48 --> 4473.62
is a life influenced by the night sky

4469.219 --> 4473.62
like how the Sun influences life

4477.44 --> 4483.44
wow that is quite the question there

4480.98 --> 4486.218999999999
Alexander Swedish I mean it's a good

4483.44 --> 4486.219
question but

4488.48 --> 4493.218999999999
it's complicated

4491.42 --> 4496.64
you see

4493.219 --> 4499.1
I have a this is a very rough theory

4496.64 --> 4500.84
about it and that is that is the

4499.1 --> 4504.56
celestials actually the thing

4500.84 --> 4509.0
influencing us or is it merely the

4504.56 --> 4511.76
Clockwork by which we can keep track of

4509.0 --> 4513.739
the cycles that happen outside of the

4511.76 --> 4516.58
celestials like is it the celestials

4513.739 --> 4519.44
that actually influence us

4516.58 --> 4521.54
directly physically

4519.44 --> 4523.46
well if that were the case then for

4521.54 --> 4526.46
example if there's a full moon and you

4523.46 --> 4527.719
stay completely inside like at the

4526.46 --> 4528.86
basement

4527.719 --> 4530.6
right

4528.86 --> 4533.9
well then it shouldn't affect you

4530.6 --> 4536.3
because it's out there

4533.9 --> 4538.4
but still it kind of does

4536.3 --> 4540.320000000001
even if you don't know it's a full moon

4538.4 --> 4542.719
and that's weird but that's explicit

4540.32 --> 4545.32
specifically with the Moon

4542.719 --> 4547.76
and of course the Sun Well

4545.32 --> 4551.5
directly influences like your

4547.76 --> 4551.5
biochemistry and all that so

4551.9 --> 4558.44
but start positions

4556.159 --> 4560.96
I don't think so I really don't think

4558.44 --> 4563.839999999999
that that's literally like an etheric

4560.96 --> 4567.14
influence that is palpable I think it is

4563.84 --> 4570.32
more like a a tracking system

4567.14 --> 4572.900000000001
that just keeps it allows you to keep

4570.32 --> 4574.219
track of the standard app and flows that

4572.9 --> 4576.5
happen

4574.219 --> 4580.159
I think it's more about that

4576.5 --> 4585.28
and that apparently people do get locked

4580.159 --> 4587.299999999999
in to certain Cycles based on

4585.28 --> 4589.82
where they were born in the air

4587.3 --> 4591.92
apparently

4589.82 --> 4595.219
but it's not the literal celestials

4591.92 --> 4597.46
doing that it is merely the the clock to

4595.219 --> 4601.78
keep track of the cycles that are

4597.46 --> 4601.78
invisibly there that's what I believe

4603.98 --> 4608.599999999999
my input on the panel is crucial well

4610.34 --> 4615.1990000000005
I thank you for saying that tarot but uh

4612.98 --> 4616.879999999999
I don't know if the guys really agreed

4615.199 --> 4621.0199999999995
to that

4616.88 --> 4623.2390000000005
because if it is so vital then why would

4621.02 --> 4626.26
you rumpus me with ad homs when I am

4623.239 --> 4626.259999999999
performing my Arts

4627.08 --> 4631.219
you know

4628.94 --> 4634.0
that I perform for free

4631.219 --> 4634.0
as a service

4634.219 --> 4636.88
so

4639.98 --> 4646.459999999999
right so they may not agree with you

4644.239 --> 4648.5
even though in better moments oh I'm

4646.46 --> 4650.9
sure it's going to be all praise oh it's

4648.5 --> 4653.36
so great yeah but how about praise when

4650.9 --> 4655.28
it actually matters like when I'm doing

4653.36 --> 4657.62
it

4655.28 --> 4660.0199999999995
yeah

4657.62 --> 4662.199
because if you're just gonna keep doing

4660.02 --> 4665.6
that and then

4662.199 --> 4667.339999999999
afterwards like way afterward when it's

4665.6 --> 4668.84
all better atmosphere oh yeah it's so

4667.34 --> 4672.7390000000005
nice praising people when everybody

4668.84 --> 4675.1990000000005
feels good isn't it how about actually

4672.739 --> 4676.94
not doing the shitty things when I

4675.199 --> 4677.96
actually do it

4676.94 --> 4681.199
yeah

4677.96 --> 4683.3
I prefer that more than praise

4681.199 --> 4684.5
when everybody's feeling all nice and

4683.3 --> 4688.04
comfy

4684.5 --> 4689.719
yeah because it's very easy to praise

4688.04 --> 4691.76
people when everybody's all nice and

4689.719 --> 4693.86
comfy it's great oh it's so nice yeah

4691.76 --> 4695.96
yeah but it doesn't really hold much

4693.86 --> 4697.58
weight now does it

4695.96 --> 4700.52
yeah

4697.58 --> 4703.159
Now Praise when things are tough

4700.52 --> 4706.2390000000005
that holds away because that's actually

4703.159 --> 4706.239
quite tough to do

4707.78 --> 4711.8
yeah

4708.8 --> 4713.719
and it's also known that that specific

4711.8 --> 4717.56
setup

4713.719 --> 4721.04
is actually associated with respect

4717.56 --> 4723.56
yeah because respect is pointless when

4721.04 --> 4725.9
everybody's all nice and cozy yeah no

4723.56 --> 4729.679
it's when things get tough that's when

4725.9 --> 4732.5
the real respect shows

4729.679 --> 4733.82
or doesn't show

4732.5 --> 4736.52
see

4733.82 --> 4738.799999999999
that's what it's about it's not whether

4736.52 --> 4740.84
when everybody's all nice and cozy that

4738.8 --> 4744.08
they can praise me oh it's so cute no no

4740.84 --> 4746.179
I want the respect

4744.08 --> 4749.0199999999995
and not just praise when everybody's

4746.179 --> 4749.02
feeling all great

4757.27 --> 4760.479
[Music]

4761.0 --> 4765.62
it's almost as good it's 40 good well

4763.52 --> 4768.620000000001
sorry Casey look there's many different

4765.62 --> 4772.04
levels of astrology reading

4768.62 --> 4773.12
and some of it is pretty scarily On

4772.04 --> 4775.58
Target

4773.12 --> 4778.46
but it's not just something you look up

4775.58 --> 4781.58
in a newspaper

4778.46 --> 4785.3
but there is a real mystical art to it

4781.58 --> 4787.5199999999995
with like really old refined knowledge

4785.3 --> 4792.14
that we really don't even have the

4787.52 --> 4795.8
mindset anymore to truly understand

4792.14 --> 4797.6
old stuff from another era from an other

4795.8 --> 4801.26
mind

4797.6 --> 4804.8
other Minds from another time

4801.26 --> 4807.4400000000005
but it's very old knowledge

4804.8 --> 4809.4800000000005
but yeah people don't get that and so

4807.44 --> 4811.4
they'll just say oh astrology so what's

4809.48 --> 4813.0199999999995
my fortune cookie for today let's look

4811.4 --> 4816.379999999999
at the newspaper yeah that that happens

4813.02 --> 4818.900000000001
but that really has very very little to

4816.38 --> 4821.84
do with actual astrology

4818.9 --> 4824.36
this is more like astrology based

4821.84 --> 4826.159000000001
cartoons it's like ooh let me get my

4824.36 --> 4828.0199999999995
prediction for today let me get my

4826.159 --> 4830.299999999999
cartoon for today right that's what that

4828.02 --> 4833.900000000001
is it's not really astrology I mean come

4830.3 --> 4837.08
on real astrology requires personal data

4833.9 --> 4839.239
in great detail

4837.08 --> 4841.699
and it's not going to be one little

4839.239 --> 4843.08
block a text it's going to be quite

4841.699 --> 4847.58
elaborate

4843.08 --> 4850.12
and unexpectedly detailed

4847.58 --> 4850.12
anyway

4854.54 --> 4858.98
she doesn't keep track yeah right

4856.34 --> 4861.32
Alexander it is yeah especially if

4858.98 --> 4863.12
you're like empathic and most women are

4861.32 --> 4865.659
more influenced by the full moon than

4863.12 --> 4865.659
even men

4866.84 --> 4871.219
right

4868.58 --> 4873.76
but I get pretty influenced by the moon

4871.219 --> 4873.76
as well

4882.08 --> 4887.0199999999995
okay stallion 8012 I appreciate that

4884.659 --> 4887.0199999999995
notion

4888.38 --> 4891.9800000000005
but I don't think I'm doing myself an

4890.3 --> 4894.62
injustice like that I'm actually

4891.98 --> 4896.299999999999
sticking up for myself the best way I

4894.62 --> 4901.04
can

4896.3 --> 4904.34
through actual skill and insight

4901.04 --> 4907.699
through proving my capacities and

4904.34 --> 4911.4800000000005
showing that I do actually deserve that

4907.699 --> 4914.719
and that when I stick up for myself it's

4911.48 --> 4917.239
not just a reflex now I mean that when I

4914.719 --> 4919.699
stick up for myself I actually mean it

4917.239 --> 4922.58
and I will be very pissed off if people

4919.699 --> 4924.919999999999
poo poo that just like oh let's just

4922.58 --> 4927.8
move on no no no let's let's not just

4924.92 --> 4929.17
move on I don't just get pissed off for

4927.8 --> 4934.81
no damn reason

4929.17 --> 4934.81
[Music]

4935.239 --> 4937.879999999999
foreign

4935.92 --> 4941.5
[Music]

4937.88 --> 4941.5
but I appreciate the comment

4944.59 --> 4950.26
[Music]

4947.48 --> 4950.259999999999
ah

4950.32 --> 4954.5599999999995
[Music]

4953.48 --> 4956.9
right

4954.56 --> 4959.719
anyway I didn't expect so many people to

4956.9 --> 4962.379999999999
be here 30 watching

4959.719 --> 4962.38
it's pretty cool

4975.56 --> 4981.52
uh okay I've read Nathan they're

4978.08 --> 4981.5199999999995
reviewing Hassan fefa

4981.679 --> 4985.46
goodie

4983.36 --> 4987.88
so that means it's just Nathan rambling

4985.46 --> 4987.88
mostly

4990.38 --> 4996.9800000000005
yeah but this is a lot more interesting

4993.56 --> 4998.900000000001
isn't it direct interaction

4996.98 --> 5000.82
you can actually like put down

4998.9 --> 5004.659
complicated questions and train a

5000.82 --> 5010.08
thinking in the chat and see me directly

5004.659 --> 5010.08
respond to a high detail how about that

5013.659 --> 5017.4
are you not entertained

5020.98 --> 5026.5
that's a rhetorical question by the way

5023.14 --> 5026.5
anyway ah

5028.95 --> 5032.8099999999995
[Music]

5033.159 --> 5036.0
okay

5043.3 --> 5048.64
yeah but Thor KC is that even true for

5046.36 --> 5050.5
like aren't all fortune cookies just

5048.64 --> 5053.1990000000005
English text I don't even think they

5050.5 --> 5057.04
even use fortune cookies in Chinese

5053.199 --> 5059.0199999999995
I mean it's like

5057.04 --> 5062.0199999999995
like wooden shoes in the Netherlands

5059.02 --> 5065.860000000001
like nobody actually walks on wooden

5062.02 --> 5068.38
shoes except for some farmers

5065.86 --> 5070.9
when they're working that's it right

5068.38 --> 5073.54
yeah everybody oh we've gone to Holiday

5070.9 --> 5075.28
I gotta get a water pair of these wooden

5073.54 --> 5077.26
shoes it's so funny and then I prove

5075.28 --> 5079.0599999999995
that I'm in the Netherlands well that's

5077.26 --> 5081.34
like fortune cookies for China I don't

5079.06 --> 5083.8
think they give a [ __ ] about freaking

5081.34 --> 5086.679
fortune cookies there except for oh it's

5083.8 --> 5088.38
something we can sell making money

5086.679 --> 5091.179
right that's it

5088.38 --> 5093.42
I don't think I gave a [ __ ]

5091.179 --> 5096.58
it's not really a Chinese thing

5093.42 --> 5098.86
[Music]

5096.58 --> 5101.38
so there's not likely to be Chinese

5098.86 --> 5103.48
cookies with actual Chinese text in them

5101.38 --> 5105.78
because they don't give a [ __ ] about

5103.48 --> 5105.78
that

5129.28 --> 5133.86
right

5130.42 --> 5133.86
what are you two talking about

5134.56 --> 5139.42
anyway

5136.84 --> 5142.42
probably gonna round out the show soon

5139.42 --> 5145.12
also getting a bit hungry oh oh look at

5142.42 --> 5147.6990000000005
this beautiful oh

5145.12 --> 5150.239
wow check this out look how beautiful

5147.699 --> 5150.239
that is

5152.26 --> 5157.26
completely cleared up it's amazing

5164.8 --> 5169.3
I mean when the show started would did

5167.739 --> 5170.5599999999995
you expect it was going to look like

5169.3 --> 5175.38
this

5170.56 --> 5175.38
one and a half hour later I wasn't

5176.62 --> 5180.659
huh that was really fast

5185.34 --> 5190.62
anyway I'm gonna take two minute break

5187.719 --> 5190.62
I'll be right back

5190.9 --> 5193.9
foreign

5219.88 --> 5224.5
horse

5222.06 --> 5227.080000000001
of course he was sitting on the freaking

5224.5 --> 5229.36
toilet now of course

5227.08 --> 5232.96
you know I you know freaking happens

5229.36 --> 5235.5
like one out of three times

5232.96 --> 5235.5
anyway

5254.739 --> 5260.159
English and from Chinese and oh they do

5257.38 --> 5260.159000000001
that okay

5263.22 --> 5266.419
[Music]

5267.219 --> 5272.94
okay in that case yeah you could

5269.08 --> 5272.94
probably learn Chinese from it then

5291.219 --> 5294.3
oh yeah

5298.179 --> 5304.4800000000005
right I think I'm gonna round out

5302.139 --> 5307.5
getting hungry did you hear my stomach

5304.48 --> 5307.5
rumbling just now

5309.94 --> 5314.62
wait

5311.52 --> 5318.9400000000005
I hope you guys enjoyed like this late

5314.62 --> 5321.88
but slightly extended Beyond normal show

5318.94 --> 5325.919999999999
well I at least was able to put down

5321.88 --> 5325.92
everything I've been very fluid

5329.44 --> 5332.739
so yeah it's a pretty good stream I'd

5331.36 --> 5336.96
say

5332.739 --> 5336.959999999999
all right I just gotta end sometime

5338.98 --> 5343.62
so I guess thanks everyone for coming

5350.739 --> 5356.5599999999995
what

5352.06 --> 5359.9800000000005
all domestic flights altered what

5356.56 --> 5363.0
really did that just happen

5359.98 --> 5367.0
it was beyond great okay

5363.0 --> 5370.12
well enjoyed the glory then Flat Earth

5367.0 --> 5372.4
artist I'm glad you enjoyed it

5370.12 --> 5375.34
I normally it could just be like an

5372.4 --> 5378.04
internet thing I don't know

5375.34 --> 5380.139
or maybe just like hell just broke loose

5378.04 --> 5381.82
and there's another 911 type of it I

5380.139 --> 5383.62
don't know man skeptic it could be all

5381.82 --> 5386.739
kinds of things but don't forget there's

5383.62 --> 5390.159
also like the giant disaster situation

5386.739 --> 5392.98
in California still taking place oh and

5390.159 --> 5394.719
by the way Rasta heads village where he

5392.98 --> 5397.599999999999
used to live

5394.719 --> 5400.06
like not even half a year ago is

5397.6 --> 5402.1
completely destroyed

5400.06 --> 5405.46
serious

5402.1 --> 5409.620000000001
like it's totally trashed

5405.46 --> 5409.62
like uninhabitable now

5409.9 --> 5414.638999999999
can you imagine that right so if that

5412.179 --> 5416.139
happened to his village where he used to

5414.639 --> 5417.88
live was probably a whole bunch of

5416.139 --> 5419.9800000000005
places who knows

5417.88 --> 5421.78
they could have declared an emergency or

5419.98 --> 5425.739
something we'll see

5421.78 --> 5428.5599999999995
so I guess I'll hear about that

5425.739 --> 5431.259999999999
more about that tomorrow

5428.56 --> 5433.659000000001
or tonight skeptic

5431.26 --> 5436.12
but let's just hope it's some kind of a

5433.659 --> 5437.739
internet glitch or update or something

5436.12 --> 5440.199
anyway
