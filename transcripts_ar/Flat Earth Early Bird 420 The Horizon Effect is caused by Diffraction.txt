would be much appreciated so yeah today

66.71 --> 74.69
the weather is completely different it's

70.19 --> 77.96
really clear mostly except there has

74.69 --> 81.319
been yeah many f cam trailing going on

77.96 --> 86.03
it as you can see by the soup over there

81.319 --> 95.709
it's pity but yes despite that pretty

86.03 --> 95.709
beautiful and sunny yeah it's nice

97.25 --> 112.26
so yeah today I just have green tea bit

107.31 --> 118.07000000000001
hungry because I didn't have a lot to

112.26 --> 121.46000000000001
eat right but anyway let's use in chat

118.07 --> 125.1
yeah Oh mocha was first Tom Parker

121.46 --> 126.57
Michael be over Michael and don't know

125.1 --> 131.69
why I mention him again

126.57 --> 131.69
Martin Ellen Amanda young more colored

131.78 --> 146.76
good servant schwas Oh whatever flatter

141.12 --> 154.26
spaceman dank Elijah Freeman USB power

146.76 --> 158.64
one one seven Randy yeah good to see you

154.26 --> 160.79999999999998
all and a koala ah right yeah I was

158.64 --> 168.44
watching a sleeping Warriors hangout but

160.8 --> 173.34
he quit he just sees half a minute ago

168.44 --> 177.29
thanks Tony yeah was pretty it was

173.34 --> 181.68
interesting it was a response video to

177.29 --> 183.66
hillbilly blue balls and some others I

181.68 --> 186.63
think I don't know what yeah about

183.66 --> 189.18
optics and just to point out how

186.63 --> 192.54
ridiculous they're the ballers assertion

189.18 --> 195.92000000000002
are assertions are about about visuals

192.54 --> 195.92
it was pretty good

196.93 --> 208.17000000000002
so you and common sense us okay

211.26 --> 220.26
it you hit the like you're a special boy

214.37 --> 222.09
well thank you a special boy fe

220.26 --> 228.04899999999998
barracuda death wish

222.09 --> 231.269
okay hello hmm big jungus twit wit hey

228.049 --> 234.78
interesting to see you today don't see

231.269 --> 236.459
you around often in my chat a sleeping

234.78 --> 239.04
warrior Oh

236.459 --> 243.209
join the Skype call you got a Skype call

239.04 --> 247.79
going oh why not but let me finish the

243.209 --> 247.79
chat though Jon Snow King of the North

248.569 --> 258.69
Joe Friday

250.4 --> 262.41
Razak 9 Duncan bullet four one one yeah

258.69 --> 264.65
rep rizzorc that's really nice but yeah

262.41 --> 267.32000000000005
it's just the same nonsense assertions

264.65 --> 269.789
we hear all the time flat earth model

267.32 --> 272.46
flat earth model can't do this flat

269.789 --> 273.0
earth model can do that well it's very

272.46 --> 274.979
simple

273.0 --> 278.18
you don't understand the Flat Earth

274.979 --> 281.039
model and you pre assume that there is a

278.18 --> 285.15000000000003
consistency in how everybody regards

281.039 --> 287.76
this in the first place so yeah and your

285.15 --> 290.539
globe model doesn't exactly make a lot

287.76 --> 293.15999999999997
of sense concerning the seasons buddy

290.539 --> 296.55
it's one of the least sensible things

293.16 --> 299.45000000000005
about the least sensible explanation

296.55 --> 302.88
about the entire heroes heliocentric

299.45 --> 305.21999999999997
conceptualization so I wouldn't worry

302.88 --> 307.56
too much about seasons supposedly not

305.22 --> 317.78900000000004
working on the Flat Earth model anyway

307.56 --> 320.13
called an optin Fiona James yeah explain

317.789 --> 322.26
seasons yeah that's well sure why not

320.13 --> 325.289
you know yeah there are Sun cycles and

322.26 --> 328.639
there's moon cycles and they have

325.289 --> 332.15999999999997
seasonal output changes it's a

328.639 --> 335.25
relatively abrupt change that this is

332.16 --> 338.40000000000003
that the Sun gives in these in these

335.25 --> 341.33
seasonal shifts but it's specifically in

338.4 --> 344.37
relation to the position of the earth so

341.33 --> 348.3
yeah at certain periods

344.37 --> 351.51
the Sun will have a typical summer

348.3 --> 354.69
output in one in the north and then a

351.51 --> 357.65999999999997
winter output in the south and also the

354.69 --> 359.669
pathways that it will take will be

357.66 --> 363.24
shorter in the winter than it is in the

359.669 --> 367.40999999999997
summer and yeah combining that you get

363.24 --> 371.16
the seasons it's just less heat or more

367.41 --> 373.53000000000003
heat so yeah that's all wrong it's wrong

371.16 --> 378.8
well that's means you're now banned

373.53 --> 378.79999999999995
because that's just [ __ ] right

379.85 --> 393.18
wrong right anyway what's a dismissed

388.46 --> 393.45
let's see if I can join this call all

393.18 --> 400.28000000000003
right

393.45 --> 400.28
it's Tony and Randy together ok cool

405.26 --> 411.78999999999996
hello hello how's it going are we yeah

410.81 --> 413.87
good

411.79 --> 415.37
just waiting on sold you just gonna made

413.87 --> 416.45
himself a brew so she should only be a

415.37 --> 419.78000000000003
couple of minutes at most

416.45 --> 421.37
all right no problem so avoid taught to

419.78 --> 422.75
you by his video that he's just pulled

421.37 --> 426.65
out my stream

422.75 --> 429.17
yeah sure it was good I saw a bit of it

426.65 --> 431.71999999999997
I actually missed the start of it so I

429.17 --> 434.96000000000004
don't know the context of it I just know

431.72 --> 438.11
that I know that I listened to a video

434.96 --> 440.23999999999995
today where the rhombus is claiming that

438.11 --> 444.83000000000004
that observation was taken from at least

440.24 --> 447.83
three feet please yeah that's complete

444.83 --> 450.77
[ __ ] isn't it yeah I mean well having

447.83 --> 453.10999999999996
done many observations from right close

450.77 --> 454.82
to there to the ocean just like that I

453.11 --> 457.13
can tell immediately that he's lowering

454.82 --> 460.46
it to at least a four it is definitely a

457.13 --> 465.8
four or even under a four but absolutely

460.46 --> 467.78
not 3v the lies these globo's tell

465.8 --> 469.76
they're just trying to pinch pinch your

467.78 --> 471.02
foot here pinch your foot there but I

469.76 --> 472.15999999999997
tell you what they could pinch 30 feet

471.02 --> 475.21
and it still wouldn't make a blind bit

472.16 --> 478.1
of difference yep

475.21 --> 479.98999999999995
do you know what books me they've got

478.1 --> 482.51000000000005
this vendetta against me right which is

479.99 --> 484.7
I find it almost endearing in the one

482.51 --> 486.98
sense because when they accused me of

484.7 --> 489.34999999999997
being dishonest there's two things

486.98 --> 493.07
happen right the ball is all rally round

489.35 --> 494.42
at the ogle yeah and it's like they're

493.07 --> 496.94
in government and they're all talking

494.42 --> 498.32
about its policy or whatever and they're

496.94 --> 500.93
all just agreeing for the sake of a

498.32 --> 502.01
green and then the I get the [ __ ] is the

500.93 --> 503.42
start message you me and you're saying

502.01 --> 505.43
look I'm not being funny I'm just

503.42 --> 506.84000000000003
curious what was the position here

505.43 --> 509.18
because they want to know what my view

506.84 --> 511.09999999999997
is now on this one I got the messages

509.18 --> 512.54
and I hadn't even realized that the

511.1 --> 514.16
video the Blue Marble science was

512.54 --> 516.8299999999999
sighting against me was not even the

514.16 --> 518.36
video that I used so if he's using the

516.83 --> 519.71
video against me that's not the video

518.36 --> 522.2
that I used and then saying that I

519.71 --> 523.669
missed bits out of it even though I put

522.2 --> 526.5200000000001
the link in the description box to the

523.669 --> 527.93
video that I did use then a it wasn't

526.52 --> 530.78
dishonest because it's the wrong video

527.93 --> 533.51
and B I couldn't not have puts couldn't

530.78 --> 535.3399999999999
not have mr. Fowle to support my assert

533.51 --> 537.38
that didn't go against my assertions

535.34 --> 539.0
because it wasn't even the right video

537.38 --> 541.43
so based on a completely

539.0 --> 543.62
fallacious video and being accused of

541.43 --> 546.02
being dishonest right all the ballers

543.62 --> 547.82
jump all over it oh yeah and all the

546.02 --> 549.17
fuss is like what's going on here and

547.82 --> 550.61
I'm like I don't not sure let me have a

549.17 --> 552.11
look at it and then I realize it's based

550.61 --> 553.85
on a video that's not even the one that

552.11 --> 556.4300000000001
I did use and then you have to question

553.85 --> 558.0500000000001
I have to raise the question why is he

556.43 --> 559.9699999999999
site in the video against me that was

558.05 --> 561.56
not used and then saying that ice I

559.97 --> 563.6
didn't put stuff in that I should have

561.56 --> 565.0699999999999
done for a video that I did not site on

563.6 --> 565.7900000000001
a channel that I've only just found out

565.07 --> 568.0400000000001
existed

565.79 --> 569.48
come on at least get me on somewhat

568.04 --> 570.65
where I am actually wrong rather than

569.48 --> 576.6800000000001
some of that you just completely plucked

570.65 --> 578.9599999999999
out of thin air you're presenting

576.68 --> 581.6899999999999
something sorry yeah yeah just check my

578.96 --> 584.33
screen Riley and see if you can see this

581.69 --> 586.58
we're lying to you you led me all

584.33 --> 591.44
hillbilly blue balls let's see sleep in

586.58 --> 594.35
warrior from one month ago hang on what

591.44 --> 599.3000000000001
runs Who am I looking here look at my

594.35 --> 601.97
screen I'm screen sharing with you this

599.3 --> 604.25
is on YouTube recommended one month ago

601.97 --> 606.77
no views just click the link does it

604.25 --> 610.04
work it will link ever I'm just showing

606.77 --> 613.18
you that it shows one month yeah well

610.04 --> 617.5999999999999
just click the link it sees it dead link

613.18 --> 619.2199999999999
waiting for sleeping warrior right so

617.6 --> 620.99
that's obviously right what I need to do

619.22 --> 622.76
then so that's linking to someone else

620.99 --> 624.02
that's on YouTube studio I need to end

622.76 --> 625.64
of that because that's happening as

624.02 --> 627.25
though I'm gonna go live with it that

625.64 --> 629.48
might be something to do YouTube that

627.25 --> 633.8
will be but just a pointing it out

629.48 --> 635.0600000000001
because what I need to do is now work

633.8 --> 636.5889999999999
out of the council because what I did

635.06 --> 639.7399999999999
was them you know in the livestream in

636.589 --> 642.7700000000001
time I used the live streaming tab to

639.74 --> 645.05
set up am an advert and when I went live

642.77 --> 648.89
on slobs I thought that that would link

645.05 --> 651.2299999999999
to that and basically do that or I need

648.89 --> 653.35
to work out how to now council that is

651.23 --> 660.14
it that I think that might be it

653.35 --> 661.6700000000001
sorry carry on yeah I mean I want to

660.14 --> 664.13
point out something that gleam said in

661.67 --> 667.55
the chat claim said that that horizon is

664.13 --> 669.709
about 10 miles away well no because he's

667.55 --> 672.8399999999999
not taking into the cumulative effect of

669.709 --> 675.66
perspective yeah right it's very further

672.84 --> 677.58
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a random claim

675.66 --> 678.4499999999999
here it could be way off or it could be

677.58 --> 681.63
quite accurate

678.45 --> 683.19
but beyond the platform I'm gonna make

681.63 --> 685.97
her an outlandish claim that there's

683.19 --> 689.1
perhaps fifty miles of additional

685.97 --> 691.95
horizon beyond that simply due to the

689.1 --> 694.74
laws of perspective because yeah because

691.95 --> 697.0500000000001
for each millimeter or each pixel that's

694.74 --> 700.41
actually further in the distance you're

697.05 --> 702.93
getting a much greater length of ocean

700.41 --> 705.5699999999999
that you're actually viewing so I would

702.93 --> 707.1899999999999
say at least fifteen miles and the thing

705.57 --> 708.96
is right no one's ever gonna know

707.19 --> 710.6400000000001
because we don't have anything to denote

708.96 --> 712.71
the distance so we could say it's a

710.64 --> 714.18
million miles and just say it's extreme

712.71 --> 715.8000000000001
amount of perspective in the same way

714.18 --> 717.2399999999999
the ballers say it's an extreme amount

715.8 --> 719.37
of refraction but the problem is the

717.24 --> 721.5600000000001
refraction model is based on geometry

719.37 --> 723.72
right and it's it's it's limited based

721.56 --> 726.18
on that geometry it isn't based on fata

723.72 --> 729.27
morgana or superior mirages or inferior

726.18 --> 732.0
it's based on geometrics right you can't

729.27 --> 734.16
argue superior mirages fata morgana x'

732.0 --> 737.13
because that's not your model your model

734.16 --> 739.02
is based on 76 our 86 our 96 are and

737.13 --> 740.43
flattening out the curve well I'm one

739.02 --> 741.93
Jeff to flatten it out before it comes

740.43 --> 742.38
flat well they've got a Tim for that

741.93 --> 747.9
slider

742.38 --> 749.4
don't forget the guns flat just remember

747.9 --> 751.47
that term because I want to use this

749.4 --> 753.5699999999999
against these globe heads whenever they

751.47 --> 755.5500000000001
come to us and they say oh yeah we can

753.57 --> 757.1400000000001
explain it we refraction we just need to

755.55 --> 759.4399999999999
sort of glad go back and instead that we

757.14 --> 762.21
need to create a term that literally

759.44 --> 764.49
sort of like slaps them on the face and

762.21 --> 767.1
says yeah with your into infinite slider

764.49 --> 769.05
you have an infinite ladder you can just

767.1 --> 771.15
infinitely slide it till it looks flat

769.05 --> 772.8299999999999
it's the same argument when they apply

771.15 --> 774.4499999999999
gravity even though we know gravity is

772.83 --> 776.6700000000001
not a force because Einstein tells us

774.45 --> 778.7700000000001
it's not a force it's the same arguments

776.67 --> 781.0799999999999
as even if it was a force it's that

778.77 --> 783.15
microscopically small it doesn't do

781.08 --> 785.5200000000001
anything but because it exists as a

783.15 --> 787.5
force they can then rate the scale of

785.52 --> 789.51
that force and apply it for the reason

787.5 --> 791.16
why the oceans are l2 the earth even

789.51 --> 792.96
though it's a microscopically small and

791.16 --> 794.9699999999999
it wouldn't even stop a fart from

792.96 --> 795.27
dispersing in a lift do you know what I

794.97 --> 796.9200000000001
mean

795.27 --> 798.21
but they'll apply it against the oceans

796.92 --> 799.6999999999999
of the earth of the earth help being

798.21 --> 802.08
held together because they say

799.7 --> 803.4300000000001
mathematically it's proportionate to its

802.08 --> 805.5
mass what

803.43 --> 807.63
that it's not a [ __ ] force but even

805.5 --> 809.61
if it was it's a fifty millionth of the

807.63 --> 811.74
mass and even though it is technically

809.61 --> 814.32
proportionate it's a fifty millionth of

811.74 --> 815.58
that proportion it's [ __ ] all but

814.32 --> 817.2600000000001
they'll still claim it anyway and

815.58 --> 818.85
they'll rate the scale so what they're

817.26 --> 821.25
doing is the raping the scale again with

818.85 --> 822.5400000000001
the refraction the refractometer and all

821.25 --> 823.68
they need to do is slide it any way they

822.54 --> 824.88
want to account for it if it's

823.68 --> 826.5
Pontchartrain it goes all the way out to

824.88 --> 827.97
the left if it's flat earth it goes all

826.5 --> 829.38
the way up to the right oh I can run a

827.97 --> 831.39
minute on this one it goes right the way

829.38 --> 833.279
up to the right and that's assuming that

831.39 --> 835.11
all the way to the right is flat wife

833.279 --> 836.3389999999999
all the way to the all the way to the

835.11 --> 838.92
right on Walter Bissell's curve

836.339 --> 840.2090000000001
calculator is actually concave and now

838.92 --> 842.01
we're looking at a roller coaster going

840.209 --> 843.7199999999999
up and over our end and it's actually

842.01 --> 845.459
concave that we're seeing and I'm not

843.72 --> 847.08
saying it is I'm just saying what the

845.459 --> 849.27
[ __ ] the scale calculator on the

847.08 --> 851.82
calculator that they thinks true what is

849.27 --> 854.52
it it's [ __ ] can I get some input

851.82 --> 857.0400000000001
but red cover and great conversation

854.52 --> 859.38
though but hey I agree the what the

857.04 --> 861.3299999999999
Glovers have done especially the ones

859.38 --> 865.62
that did all the the calculators know

861.33 --> 868.1700000000001
that they've taken the concept of actual

865.62 --> 871.52
optical based refraction and take it way

868.17 --> 874.38
out of proportion and then set out the

871.52 --> 876.99
conditions supposedly out there that are

874.38 --> 880.2
allow it to be extremely flexible in

876.99 --> 884.19
order for any siding to basically fit

880.2 --> 887.6400000000001
their globe in a way but yeah the

884.19 --> 890.94
fraction is minut in reality and very

887.64 --> 893.61
conditional very local relatively but

890.94 --> 897.2700000000001
they take it universally in in the whole

893.61 --> 899.27
spectrum of vision not just the only

897.27 --> 902.04
places where it actually does occur and

899.27 --> 903.9
yeah then just imagine it goes all over

902.04 --> 906.77
the place and then they can pick any

903.9 --> 910.529
arbitrary point on that huge our

906.77 --> 913.68
fraction scale and make it fit whatever

910.529 --> 916.23
sighting is out there yeah that's what

913.68 --> 917.8499999999999
it is are you able to screen are you

916.23 --> 921.48
able to present my screen yeah I am

917.85 --> 922.14
wearing do love you so my own now yes

921.48 --> 925.279
you are

922.14 --> 928.829
look at what I've been typing refraction

925.279 --> 931.2
definition refraction definition should

928.829 --> 932.64
bring me up the Wikipedia page a fractal

931.2 --> 935.22
phenomenon of light radio waves etcetera

932.64 --> 936.87
be deflected in passing or obliquely

935.22 --> 937.07
through the interface between one medium

936.87 --> 938.96
and

937.07 --> 940.7600000000001
another or through a medium of varying

938.96 --> 943.46
density right now watch what happens

940.76 --> 945.29
with the here we go

943.46 --> 947.45
refraction Wikipedia right bear in mind

945.29 --> 949.37
that they often cite Wikipedia and I

947.45 --> 950.9300000000001
hate it because it's it can be modified

949.37 --> 952.37
by boil the trolls right so it's not

950.93 --> 955.3399999999999
exactly reliable but look what it says

952.37 --> 956.84
in physics refraction is to change in

955.34 --> 958.76
direction of a wave passing from one

956.84 --> 960.59
meeting to another or from a gradual

958.76 --> 962.75
change in the medium refraction of light

960.59 --> 964.7
is most commonly observed is the most

962.75 --> 966.71
commonly observed phenomena but waves

964.7 --> 968.57
such as sound waves waterways also

966.71 --> 970.25
experience refraction how much is

968.57 --> 972.38
determined by the changing wave speed

970.25 --> 974.39
and the initial direction of wave

972.38 --> 977.03
propagate propagation relative to the

974.39 --> 978.8
direction of change in speed and and

977.03 --> 980.0899999999999
then it talks about Snell's law I'm just

978.8 --> 983.93
trying to find the part where I found it

980.09 --> 986.27
earlier on no I can't actually find it

983.93 --> 987.7099999999999
after what I was going to cite what it

986.27 --> 989.3
said somewhat about when I looked at it

987.71 --> 991.01
last time it said refraction unless this

989.3 --> 993.14
has been changed or I had a different

991.01 --> 995.06
citation for it it said and the way it

993.14 --> 996.74
described a fraction it was talking

995.06 --> 998.15
about things like Superior Irish fata

996.74 --> 1000.55
morgana or whatever and it never once

998.15 --> 1003.64
said the geometry of the earth or seven

1000.55 --> 1005.4399999999999
over six R or any DV or any variation of

1003.64 --> 1007.18
the geometry that they apply for

1005.44 --> 1009.22
non-standard refraction it were all

1007.18 --> 1010.4799999999999
based on atmospheric phenomena but there

1009.22 --> 1012.82
wasn't any maths in it

1010.48 --> 1015.1
all of the phenomena was like real-world

1012.82 --> 1017.59
application like superior mirages before

1015.1 --> 1019.5400000000001
him fata morgana x' right but by virtue

1017.59 --> 1022.09
of it not being stated that it was based

1019.54 --> 1024.55
on 76 hour which they claim it is how

1022.09 --> 1026.589
can they claim 7-6 our refraction when

1024.55 --> 1028.6889999999999
it isn't even part of the definition for

1026.589 --> 1030.4589999999998
refraction because refraction is

1028.689 --> 1032.5600000000002
real-world application of what we see at

1030.459 --> 1034.15
the horizon but it's not geometric

1032.56 --> 1035.74
mathematically calculated and that's

1034.15 --> 1037.39
what they're applying to it and calling

1035.74 --> 1039.01
it refraction slow even [ __ ]

1037.39 --> 1046.63
refraction it's a mathematical

1039.01 --> 1049.96
expression yeah hey guys by the way I've

1046.63 --> 1053.5300000000002
been thinking since that conversation I

1049.96 --> 1055.66
had with with quantum eraser I think it

1053.53 --> 1057.97
was on the ever after show from two days

1055.66 --> 1061.5700000000002
ago that Randi happened to play

1057.97 --> 1066.8500000000001
yesterday was good right I've been

1061.57 --> 1070.24
thinking a lot about this refraction the

1066.85 --> 1070.8999999999999
in the in the double slit right what it

1070.24 --> 1074.11
actually

1070.9 --> 1076.24
in the comparison to larger objects

1074.11 --> 1079.27
include like buckyballs even but just

1076.24 --> 1082.09
conceptualizing it bullets how you fire

1079.27 --> 1084.46
them past a flat surface that yeah

1082.09 --> 1087.52
because of turbulence presumably it's

1084.46 --> 1088.93
gonna deflect downwards right if you

1087.52 --> 1091.059
should it pass something because

1088.93 --> 1093.97
turbulence in balance it's going to be

1091.059 --> 1095.77
less pressure down as up and so it will

1093.97 --> 1099.13
deflect downwards because of the close

1095.77 --> 1101.08
proximity and it seems like light in its

1099.13 --> 1104.74
own way does a similar thing as

1101.08 --> 1106.84
demonstrated by the double slit well I'm

1104.74 --> 1110.17
starting to put some pieces together

1106.84 --> 1114.25
concerning the horizon effect right

1110.17 --> 1116.92
because yeah we are looking over a flat

1114.25 --> 1120.7
surface into the distance or at some

1116.92 --> 1122.3200000000002
point you're yeah the light it bet to

1120.7 --> 1126.9
reach your eye is gonna have to travel

1122.32 --> 1130.48
so close to the surface that eventually

1126.9 --> 1132.929
it's gonna be suddenly bent downwards

1130.48 --> 1135.79
like a little notch because of

1132.929 --> 1137.98
unexpected refraction from the close

1135.79 --> 1143.7
proximity and that will typically then

1137.98 --> 1147.64
result in reflection reflection upwards

1143.7 --> 1149.77
see and now if you see it like that that

1147.64 --> 1152.89
the trace of the tracing the light

1149.77 --> 1155.11
suddenly the horizon and yeah this

1152.89 --> 1159.73
mirror of everything makes a lot more

1155.11 --> 1162.58
sense do you see it it is I think the

1159.73 --> 1164.92
way I think the way it bends down as

1162.58 --> 1168.6899999999998
soon as it gets close enough it just got

1164.92 --> 1172.3200000000002
not just Boop and then it reflects and

1168.69 --> 1176.74
yeah closer the angle becomes too

1172.32 --> 1179.1699999999998
perfectly horizontal as it were with the

1176.74 --> 1181.179
surface after that certain point it will

1179.17 --> 1182.91
always start reflecting this makes

1181.179 --> 1186.7900000000002
perfect sense I can now actually

1182.91 --> 1189.64
visualize how the horizon visual comes

1186.79 --> 1191.08
into being every time what you're trying

1189.64 --> 1193.1200000000001
to do is you're trying to you're trying

1191.08 --> 1196.57
to conflate two things and one of them

1193.12 --> 1200.59
is a ray of light from like a laser or

1196.57 --> 1203.1399999999999
something - ambient - ambient light yes

1200.59 --> 1204.82
sir good work with ambient light - we

1203.14 --> 1206.8300000000002
discussed it I'm

1204.82 --> 1208.96
I'm going to make a claim and that you

1206.83 --> 1210.97
upset this all along but I don't think

1208.96 --> 1213.49
that ambient light behaves the same way

1210.97 --> 1217.81
as a light ray I can see that you can

1213.49 --> 1219.91
you can manipulate a laser beam and make

1217.81 --> 1222.28
it change direction but I don't think

1219.91 --> 1224.41
you can do the same on an ambient light

1222.28 --> 1226.1499999999999
I don't think you can do it look at like

1224.41 --> 1227.89
looking at a building in the distance I

1226.15 --> 1231.52
don't think that happens I've never seen

1227.89 --> 1234.5200000000002
it no what no but I've never been able

1231.52 --> 1238.24
to see I've never seen manipulation of a

1234.52 --> 1241.09
building yeah let me yell then realize

1238.24 --> 1243.1
in a way what actually transpired with

1241.09 --> 1245.62
even a camera okay it goes through a

1243.1 --> 1249.25
lens and then it flips around your

1245.62 --> 1254.6799999999998
reality so I don't see the point really

1249.25 --> 1257.38
like it is yeah it the double slit the

1254.68 --> 1260.47
the wave pattern it always occurs it's

1257.38 --> 1263.65
just that when you use full spectrum

1260.47 --> 1265.78
light it will be in different patterns

1263.65 --> 1267.3700000000001
crossing through one another but there's

1265.78 --> 1270.16
no spatter pne's will still be there

1267.37 --> 1272.5
it's just the the pattern really comes

1270.16 --> 1275.8000000000002
out clearly when you use one spectrum of

1272.5 --> 1278.89
light well it works with everything it

1275.8 --> 1282.7
works with all light will prove the

1278.89 --> 1286.8100000000002
ambient light it you know it behaves the

1282.7 --> 1290.41
same way as as a laser beam proofer why

1286.81 --> 1292.54
doesn't exactly but yeh all types of

1290.41 --> 1294.49
light will be subjected to the wave

1292.54 --> 1296.95
pattern effect when going through a

1294.49 --> 1303.73
double slit all of it quantum eraser

1296.95 --> 1305.77
said this - can I be heard alright I

1303.73 --> 1307.39
just didn't know whether that's the next

1305.77 --> 1313.42
week ya know you need to thank you need

1307.39 --> 1315.97
to you need to do a short walkins come

1313.42 --> 1321.49
on come on this is I just made a very

1315.97 --> 1322.72
interesting concept put it down I don't

1321.49 --> 1324.7
know is the answer to your question I

1322.72 --> 1326.23
don't I don't think any was really

1324.7 --> 1328.27
understanding off about light to be able

1326.23 --> 1330.64
to describe exactly what all we can say

1328.27 --> 1331.9
is what we see right can we prove what's

1330.64 --> 1333.46
causing it when there are so many

1331.9 --> 1335.1100000000001
factors that influence what we see and

1333.46 --> 1337.33
the answer I think is not really know

1335.11 --> 1338.6799999999998
they can calculate it and say that it's

1337.33 --> 1340.06
their working model

1338.68 --> 1341.67
they're working model if it doesn't

1340.06 --> 1344.02
match reality it doesn't match reality

1341.67 --> 1345.22
then what I wanted to do our and if it's

1344.02 --> 1347.1399999999999
all right it's just read this paragraph

1345.22 --> 1348.58
about atmospheric refraction because

1347.14 --> 1351.88
this is on the Wikipedia page this is

1348.58 --> 1353.4099999999999
the bit here reason why I want to cite

1351.88 --> 1355.6000000000001
it is because I want you guys in the

1353.41 --> 1357.88
audience to realize that they do not

1355.6 --> 1359.77
mention seven over six are they mention

1357.88 --> 1361.3300000000002
all the things that we talked about but

1359.77 --> 1363.01
on their model they can't argue seven

1361.33 --> 1364.99
the can't argue fata morgana [ __ ]

1363.01 --> 1367.15
because that isn't their model their

1364.99 --> 1370.21
model is geometric so this is what it

1367.15 --> 1372.0400000000002
says the refractive index of air depends

1370.21 --> 1374.3500000000001
on the density and thus varies with air

1372.04 --> 1377.2
temperature and pressure since a prep I

1374.35 --> 1379.1499999999999
will look prejudice anyway this pressure

1377.2 --> 1381.16
is lower at higher altitudes the

1379.15 --> 1383.0500000000002
refractive index is also lower causing

1381.16 --> 1384.94
light rays to refract towards the

1383.05 --> 1387.19
Earth's surface when traveling long

1384.94 --> 1389.47
distances through the atmosphere the

1387.19 --> 1391.78
problem is the refractive index when

1389.47 --> 1394.75
it's going over water water vapor is

1391.78 --> 1396.49
less dense than the air around it so it

1394.75 --> 1398.5
doesn't follow it doesn't lead to what

1396.49 --> 1400.96
refract towards the earth it refractor

1398.5 --> 1403.63
away from it because the vapor is less

1400.96 --> 1405.19
dense than it so that's not true this is

1403.63 --> 1407.14
just one of these [ __ ] lines there's

1405.19 --> 1409.81
somebody like the wrong post is put into

1407.14 --> 1411.5800000000002
it but anyway this shifts the apparent

1409.81 --> 1417.19
positions of stars slightly when the

1411.58 --> 1419.4399999999998
closer the horizon the horizon during a

1417.19 --> 1421.3
sunrise temperature variations in the

1419.44 --> 1423.88
air can also cause refraction of light

1421.3 --> 1426.04
this can be seen as a heat haze not

1423.88 --> 1427.8700000000001
seven over six are when hot and cold air

1426.04 --> 1430.3
is mixed over a fire in an engine

1427.87 --> 1432.1299999999999
exhausts or when opening a wing all day

1430.3 --> 1434.68
this makes objects viewed through the

1432.13 --> 1436.9
mixed air apparent appear to shimmer now

1434.68 --> 1438.67
that shimmering is what we see at the

1436.9 --> 1440.5600000000002
horizon with what I called originally

1438.67 --> 1441.8200000000002
dirty air because I didn't know what was

1440.56 --> 1444.22
going on but I could see that it was

1441.82 --> 1446.9199999999998
like messed up right bitter refraction

1444.22 --> 1448.69
bit of Mirage in or whatever Oh none of

1446.92 --> 1450.3100000000002
this is talking about seven over six

1448.69 --> 1452.3200000000002
none of it's talking about geometric

1450.31 --> 1454.99
bending of light following the arc of an

1452.32 --> 1457.3899999999999
earth curve it's all about real world

1454.99 --> 1460.09
stuff that we observe which is not the

1457.39 --> 1462.25
model there are models limited to seven

1460.09 --> 1464.62
over six hour and variations on that

1462.25 --> 1467.32
geometry but this is they talk about

1464.62 --> 1469.3
refract it's context but it's not their

1467.32 --> 1471.01
model their model is not based on this

1469.3 --> 1471.61
their model is based on geometry of a

1471.01 --> 1472.69
sphere

1471.61 --> 1474.61
well where

1472.69 --> 1476.56
the evidence in the real world that the

1474.61 --> 1478.51
light is following different sizes fears

1476.56 --> 1480.22
because it doesn't do it it does all

1478.51 --> 1481.87
these weird things none of which you've

1480.22 --> 1483.79
got any assumption based on being on a

1481.87 --> 1485.9499999999998
sphere it's all entirely based on the

1483.79 --> 1491.11
environments it's in that's all the ones

1485.95 --> 1493.24
in a pond oh yeah well I'm now I agree

1491.11 --> 1495.4599999999998
with your point but I'm still yeah look

1493.24 --> 1499.08
I just uncovered something new a new

1495.46 --> 1501.79
project for myself I basically

1499.08 --> 1504.49
progressed my original optical slant

1501.79 --> 1507.8799999999999
theory and actually I found some ground

1504.49 --> 1511.48
works now to explain the effects I love

1507.88 --> 1513.2800000000002
it thank you for inspiring it it's

1511.48 --> 1517.1200000000001
basically the cause of the horizon

1513.28 --> 1519.28
effect I'm pretty certain now that it is

1517.12 --> 1521.6499999999999
directly caused by refraction remember

1519.28 --> 1525.94
the concealment which even works close

1521.65 --> 1529.47
by close proximity I'm pretty sure now

1525.94 --> 1533.56
that that is purely caused by surface

1529.47 --> 1536.23
refraction I mean I get it now because

1533.56 --> 1538.21
perspective you know it it explains how

1536.23 --> 1541.99
things become too small to see and

1538.21 --> 1544.57
everything and how they can be easily

1541.99 --> 1547.33
concealed in the distance but the actual

1544.57 --> 1550.21
concealment from the horizon I think it

1547.33 --> 1552.76
is really the refraction the same

1550.21 --> 1555.4
refraction that causes the wave pattern

1552.76 --> 1557.98
in the double slits I think it is that I

1555.4 --> 1561.97
am now going to have to figure out how

1557.98 --> 1565.42
to actually test that but onto something

1561.97 --> 1566.98
I can feel it I can feel it I tell you

1565.42 --> 1568.45
what was hilarious when I was watched

1566.98 --> 1572.26
Jose's Jack have you watched any of

1568.45 --> 1575.02
Jose's chart from yesterday I was there

1572.26 --> 1575.95
for yeah I was there you did a late

1575.02 --> 1579.46
night stream

1575.95 --> 1581.92
yeah just woken up and I got in there it

1579.46 --> 1583.69
was about chemtrails no no not that one

1581.92 --> 1587.02
the brownie stream that was to do with

1583.69 --> 1588.79
these platforms I haven't seen it okay

1587.02 --> 1591.25
there's a part in it whereas represent

1588.79 --> 1593.23
another video of the two of the two

1591.25 --> 1594.88
platforms but he's very close to the one

1593.23 --> 1597.6100000000001
that's six miles away you know the one

1594.88 --> 1599.0500000000002
that's nearest to us and Jose says wow

1597.61 --> 1601.59
look how small that one is in the

1599.05 --> 1604.12
background and it was like oh my god

1601.59 --> 1604.6999999999998
he's commenting on how small the one is

1604.12 --> 1605.9599999999998
but

1604.7 --> 1607.22
what he should be seen is look I'll

1605.96 --> 1609.14
break the one is in the foreground

1607.22 --> 1610.91
because the one in the foreground that

1609.14 --> 1612.17
is close to is much bigger and drowns

1610.91 --> 1614.0
out the one in the background that's

1612.17 --> 1616.3100000000002
tiny and obviously it's a function of

1614.0 --> 1617.51
perspective right by by picking on the

1616.31 --> 1620.3899999999999
one in the background that was very

1617.51 --> 1622.25
small for me is demonstrating that he

1620.39 --> 1624.74
doesn't even see perspective because

1622.25 --> 1626.99
perspective is a objects in the in the

1624.74 --> 1628.43
foreground appear bigger than objects in

1626.99 --> 1630.59
the background right as a function of

1628.43 --> 1632.51
distance Jose said look how small the

1630.59 --> 1634.04
one is in the background rather look how

1632.51 --> 1636.14
big the one is in the foreground

1634.04 --> 1637.9099999999999
that's perspective the small one in the

1636.14 --> 1639.89
background he's thinking what's going on

1637.91 --> 1641.0
there he's not thinking perspective he's

1639.89 --> 1643.7
thinking somewhere else and I'm like

1641.0 --> 1648.26
that's so long so started he did it that

1643.7 --> 1650.1200000000001
way oh yeah I don't know I don't know

1648.26 --> 1652.04
with Jose you know he has ups and down

1650.12 --> 1654.9199999999998
moments sometimes he just doesn't get

1652.04 --> 1658.37
what he sees other times he he gets it

1654.92 --> 1660.77
so maybe you know he had some where he

1658.37 --> 1663.8799999999999
kicked me out the other time it's a few

1660.77 --> 1667.07
days ago now maybe he's just now we know

1663.88 --> 1668.96
it's silly yeah I found it amazing that

1667.07 --> 1670.73
the wrong person without three two feet

1668.96 --> 1673.94
onto it and claimed three observer

1670.73 --> 1676.49
height when he was said always remember

1673.94 --> 1678.3500000000001
three years ago you would always do that

1676.49 --> 1680.21
you would always start out by first

1678.35 --> 1682.4599999999998
claiming like you got the high ground

1680.21 --> 1686.33
like every single time I came in

1682.46 --> 1688.01
remember remember yeah yeah why he needs

1686.33 --> 1689.72
to lie about the observer height to have

1688.01 --> 1691.25
any wiggle room if you can't if he

1689.72 --> 1694.25
doesn't lie about the observer ie house

1691.25 --> 1696.91
no wiggle room three feet that's just an

1694.25 --> 1698.96
absolute joke there's no way that was

1696.91 --> 1700.3100000000002
and I'm the one that gets called

1698.96 --> 1702.2
dishonest even though we can see him

1700.31 --> 1704.53
from that that incoming wave when it

1702.2 --> 1707.1200000000001
collapses is centimeters tall not feet

1704.53 --> 1709.19
centimeters it's like oh my god won't

1707.12 --> 1711.3799999999999
pursue runs he did you know itself still

1709.19 --> 1713.3300000000002
the water was on the video I did you

1711.38 --> 1715.4
notice that with all these observations

1713.33 --> 1717.9499999999998
that we see a very long way he's car

1715.4 --> 1719.39
Marty put a video out about his an

1717.95 --> 1721.16
observation that he saw an incredibly

1719.39 --> 1722.93
long way to again the water was

1721.16 --> 1724.4
incredibly flat it's the same with all

1722.93 --> 1727.19
of them tell anyone that water's really

1724.4 --> 1729.2
flat you see a long long long way so

1727.19 --> 1731.27
Twitter asks in chat he was right and

1729.2 --> 1733.64
Watson B's though right no to it with

1731.27 --> 1736.1299999999999
the claim originally it sink B's was 35

1733.64 --> 1738.73
feet we went back and measured it and it

1736.13 --> 1740.5
was 47 so it was 12 feet tall

1738.73 --> 1742.96
than what Google Earth claimed it was

1740.5 --> 1745.0
right I'll give them that but it wasn't

1742.96 --> 1746.41
a hundred hundred feet for slight they

1745.0 --> 1748.66
needed it to be to explain the

1746.41 --> 1750.28
observation the lie is twit wait you can

1748.66 --> 1751.96
believe them if you want to right you

1750.28 --> 1753.76
can believe that gravity is a force if

1751.96 --> 1755.26
you want to and you can believe that I

1753.76 --> 1757.75
cherry picked and snipped out evidence

1755.26 --> 1759.79
on a video that I didn't even cite but

1757.75 --> 1767.14
none of that makes it true you can just

1759.79 --> 1769.87
believe it if you want to charcoal

1767.14 --> 1773.3200000000002
uplands this is a video that I took when

1769.87 --> 1775.81
I went down to me Spurs chemo and rude

1773.32 --> 1778.6599999999999
eartha so rude earth the chartered a

1775.81 --> 1780.3999999999999
boat and he went out to Douglas complex

1778.66 --> 1782.92
and he went back and forth behind the

1780.4 --> 1784.1200000000001
Douglas complex not no more than a mile

1782.92 --> 1785.71
away from it because it would they were

1784.12 --> 1786.79
told they were warned off not to go

1785.71 --> 1789.1000000000001
within a mile of it because they

1786.79 --> 1791.71
contacted the boat so the skipper had to

1789.1 --> 1793.6
go stayed just over a mile away so they

1791.71 --> 1795.82
went back and forth like this and I was

1793.6 --> 1797.8
filming them way over here and what I'm

1795.82 --> 1799.06
gonna show you here is these are the two

1797.8 --> 1801.85
turbines that were actually looking

1799.06 --> 1804.19
through and we're gonna go to this one

1801.85 --> 1805.99
here we'll get a measurement on this one

1804.19 --> 1808.3600000000001
this is nine point two nine miles away

1805.99 --> 1809.86
that's the nearest one and the other one

1808.36 --> 1813.55
that we're gonna split between the two

1809.86 --> 1815.59
is ten point nine miles away ten point

1813.55 --> 1817.8999999999999
nine miles away and we see they're the

1815.59 --> 1819.4299999999998
two turbines just for reference but yet

1817.9 --> 1821.23
Rudess that was going back and forth

1819.43 --> 1824.6200000000001
here on his boat do you want to see the

1821.23 --> 1826.3
video I'll show you the video so coming

1824.62 --> 1828.1
from there's the two turbines this is

1826.3 --> 1830.56
the one that's nine point two nine miles

1828.1 --> 1833.4699999999998
away this is the one that's ten point

1830.56 --> 1835.54
nine miles away and there's the platform

1833.47 --> 1838.3600000000001
there's the Douglas platform behind it

1835.54 --> 1840.3999999999999
and you're going to see Rudy come behind

1838.36 --> 1841.57
the turbine on the right and then he's

1840.4 --> 1843.3600000000001
going to carry on and he's going to go

1841.57 --> 1846.01
up behind the turbine on the left

1843.36 --> 1847.8999999999999
exactly as you'd expect to see on a flat

1846.01 --> 1850.18
plane here he goes on his boat oh and he

1847.9 --> 1851.8000000000002
goes behind that turbo and here we go

1850.18 --> 1854.2
where you got burn in mind the observer

1851.8 --> 1856.27
height was just four feet and then he

1854.2 --> 1857.5900000000001
goes behind this as well that's the

1856.27 --> 1863.53
first chemo was with me when I was

1857.59 --> 1865.12
filming this just for look at this this

1863.53 --> 1867.69
is it going behind it one that's ten

1865.12 --> 1869.9199999999998
point nine miles away look at that oh

1867.69 --> 1871.75
yeah I'm on screen in mind

1869.92 --> 1876.1290000000001
Travis we are live

1871.75 --> 1879.519
well cursed who is this it's Travis oh

1876.129 --> 1882.399
hey I added you know I just wanted to

1879.519 --> 1884.289
mention to Travis I saw Travis has been

1882.399 --> 1885.6
in bed he's only just woke up Travis you

1884.289 --> 1889.84
can hear me right

1885.6 --> 1891.82
good morning Travis there you go crane

1889.84 --> 1894.73
crane tier cereals this morning they're

1891.82 --> 1898.6589999999999
glow bees because this is impossible on

1894.73 --> 1904.09
your model too Oh Travis is having sound

1898.659 --> 1910.6000000000001
issues but we don't here you go me we

1904.09 --> 1916.629
can hear him but Travis County Rose nope

1910.6 --> 1918.49
we can hear him though Travis is sorting

1916.629 --> 1921.129
out his [ __ ] you're right I run see the

1918.49 --> 1926.47
the good observations are always when

1921.129 --> 1928.0
the wage a man I can't hear you yeah

1926.47 --> 1929.3790000000001
there was no swell on that date that's

1928.0 --> 1931.809
the difference there was some there was

1929.379 --> 1934.12
some a little bit of wind but there was

1931.809 --> 1936.99
no there was no swell and the swell

1934.12 --> 1936.9899999999998
makes all the difference

1945.1 --> 1950.559
so yeah run to your right when the when

1948.009 --> 1952.3600000000001
the waves aren't big we see more now

1950.559 --> 1953.4089999999999
that makes me think that the waves are

1952.36 --> 1955.12
the thing that's causing the obstruction

1953.409 --> 1957.159
that they always tell us is the curve

1955.12 --> 1959.2299999999998
because there are occasions when it does

1957.159 --> 1961.0590000000002
look bendy right but because there's

1959.23 --> 1962.169
obstruction doesn't mean it is bendy it

1961.059 --> 1964.539
just means there's something obstructing

1962.169 --> 1966.46
it and we can demonstrate easily this

1964.539 --> 1968.34
that's what appears to be small waves

1966.46 --> 1970.3890000000001
kind of struck the things on the horizon

1968.34 --> 1971.47
but when there's big waves

1970.389 --> 1974.86
it helps trucks things on the horizon

1971.47 --> 1979.3790000000001
more but we can equal yeah yeah I got no

1974.86 --> 1979.379
sound well work it out and do it quietly

1983.549 --> 1989.44
so we can equally argue that refraction

1986.71 --> 1991.299
is doing it and just bastardized

1989.44 --> 1992.74
refraction but we have no evidence that

1991.299 --> 1993.94
is refracting the way that they tell us

1992.74 --> 1995.169
it is and neither do they have evidence

1993.94 --> 1997.1490000000001
that it's refracting the way they tell

1995.169 --> 1998.6200000000001
us it is either but at least we can't

1997.149 --> 2000.5089999999998
demonstrate that little waves do cause

1998.62 --> 2002.309
obstruction at the horizon medium with

2000.509 --> 2003.75
it's called a lot of obstruction and big

2002.309 --> 2004.84
waves while you're not seeing the

2003.75 --> 2007.69
turbines an ayah the

2004.84 --> 2010.48
my friends you want to say this is Heath

2007.69 --> 2015.13
Carmody's video he's titled it extreme

2010.48 --> 2016.96
looming and I'm gonna disagree look how

2015.13 --> 2018.94
flat this water is look at there's no

2016.96 --> 2021.01
ripples are they at all and guess what

2018.94 --> 2023.529
he sees an incredibly long way that

2021.01 --> 2025.24
defies the globe yet again every single

2023.529 --> 2026.98
time that we do every single time I get

2025.24 --> 2028.84
these observations like this right

2026.98 --> 2032.08
generally what's that mountain in the

2028.84 --> 2034.24
distance there I have no idea that give

2032.08 --> 2036.1589999999999
me so but he does some excellent work by

2034.24 --> 2037.33
the way so I would go and subscribe to

2036.159 --> 2039.0100000000002
Heathcott Moldy if you get the

2037.33 --> 2040.9289999999999
opportunity but yeah this is this is

2039.01 --> 2043.99
just another example of when you get

2040.929 --> 2046.3600000000001
this type of you know water that's at

2043.99 --> 2049.69
rest water that's at rest you just see a

2046.36 --> 2051.399
very long way I mean the reality is

2049.69 --> 2053.349
we're demonstrating potential causes

2051.399 --> 2055.24
real-world causes right we're not just

2053.349 --> 2057.19
saying any amount of a fraction I'll do

2055.24 --> 2059.2299999999996
I mean idle there is saying that well

2057.19 --> 2061.179
all we need is refraction and I'm like

2059.23 --> 2063.01
yeah on your model then you just apply

2061.179 --> 2065.08
as much refraction as is necessary to

2063.01 --> 2066.9700000000003
make it look fun but what's the scale

2065.08 --> 2068.83
and is the scale that's being applied

2066.97 --> 2070.8689999999997
anything like proportionate to the

2068.83 --> 2072.909
reality of negligible refraction that

2070.869 --> 2074.56
deviates from straight light doesn't

2072.909 --> 2076.57
follow a curved path it deviates from

2074.56 --> 2078.73
straight in all directions and it's

2076.57 --> 2081.159
negligible right I got the real

2078.73 --> 2083.44
refraction we see our fatima ganas Fatah

2081.159 --> 2085.359
superior mirages inferior Mirage is two

2083.44 --> 2087.099
towering stupid and all them but they're

2085.359 --> 2088.659
not part of your model they're part of

2087.099 --> 2090.4900000000002
our real-world existence right that's

2088.659 --> 2094.089
not accounted for by your standard

2090.49 --> 2096.339
geometric calculator Stallion says you

2094.089 --> 2098.92
do know that the actual name for swells

2096.339 --> 2102.31
is service for service gravity waves yes

2098.92 --> 2106.4500000000003
gravity you mean surface gravity waves

2102.31 --> 2112.99
if it is [ __ ] off we'll have yeah let's

2106.45 --> 2118.2999999999997
surf the gravity wave I've never heard

2112.99 --> 2120.3999999999996
of a surface gravity wave is that the

2118.3 --> 2122.0800000000004
ball is word for a big wave what we call

2120.4 --> 2123.1600000000003
big they call a surface gravity wave

2122.08 --> 2125.3199999999997
yeah I think they're trained to

2123.16 --> 2130.089
incorporate the word gravity into any

2125.32 --> 2132.839
kind of structure yeah we service is

2130.089 --> 2136.2599999999998
that a physical force there stallion is

2132.839 --> 2138.64
service gravity waves a physical force

2136.26 --> 2141.4900000000002
you know force listen minute allure

2138.64 --> 2145.5099999999998
demonstrating gravity causes it I

2141.49 --> 2147.519
figured it out yeah can hear us

2145.51 --> 2149.6800000000003
I can hear you now I don't know whites

2147.519 --> 2151.39
in that I was I was skyping with Mark

2149.68 --> 2152.68
doxy extra dove yesterday and I had no

2151.39 --> 2154.6299999999997
problems so I don't know what it was

2152.68 --> 2156.64
don't what are you guys doing

2154.63 --> 2158.319
but listen Travis the reason why I added

2156.64 --> 2159.64
you I wanted to address you personally

2158.319 --> 2161.319
because I heard you in Jose's chart

2159.64 --> 2163.21
yesterday and although you weren't

2161.319 --> 2164.65
defending me directly because I'm you

2163.21 --> 2166.63
didn't really know the facts you did

2164.65 --> 2168.73
raise the point that maybe I didn't snip

2166.63 --> 2171.46
or I didn't fail to snip evidence out of

2168.73 --> 2174.279
a video the e says that I did you were

2171.46 --> 2176.89
right he cited a video but I did not say

2174.279 --> 2178.63
no that's what I was telling him yeah he

2176.89 --> 2180.19
cited a video that I did not say and I

2178.63 --> 2182.619
didn't even know that the channel that

2180.19 --> 2184.289
hides right you know they don't give a

2182.619 --> 2187.21
[ __ ] about that stuff they just want to

2184.289 --> 2190.059
find anything that they can can cast

2187.21 --> 2192.25
aspersions on but that's the point I was

2190.059 --> 2195.279
harping on Anthony I was go I was like

2192.25 --> 2197.38
guys this isn't even the same video yeah

2195.279 --> 2198.579
he's he's dealing with one video yeah

2197.38 --> 2201.2200000000003
but he didn't deal with this one I'm

2198.579 --> 2203.259
like he didn't he doesn't have to know I

2201.22 --> 2205.8689999999997
said I've got tons of stuff on my

2203.259 --> 2210.19
channel I you know I don't refer back to

2205.869 --> 2212.5
you to video number 10.2 just so you

2210.19 --> 2215.559
know that it's there you know what I

2212.5 --> 2217.18
mean well when he said the M he's failed

2215.559 --> 2219.099
to he snipped out all the stuff is this

2217.18 --> 2220.72
dishonest well no yeah I didn't even

2219.099 --> 2223.299
spot that it was a different video it

2220.72 --> 2224.68
looked like it was the same clip but did

2223.299 --> 2226.42
you realize that it was on a totally

2224.68 --> 2228.6699999999996
different I mean I don't never even seen

2226.42 --> 2230.7400000000002
the channel that you cited from Travis

2228.67 --> 2232.359
port the link I put the link in the

2230.74 --> 2234.64
description of the video that I cited

2232.359 --> 2236.859
from you don't have to prove anything to

2234.64 --> 2238.269
me Anthony no no I just wanted to say

2236.859 --> 2240.8489999999997
that you were right to question it

2238.269 --> 2243.0389999999998
because I did the video in the

2240.849 --> 2244.69
description box that I relied upon right

2243.039 --> 2246.5490000000004
and it wasn't the same video that blue

2244.69 --> 2248.859
marble science is criticizing me on even

2246.549 --> 2250.869
though it was in the description box now

2248.859 --> 2252.8489999999997
is it dishonest it's not it's clearly

2250.869 --> 2256.059
not dishonest of me but why would he

2252.849 --> 2258.88
then go ahead and like claim a make a

2256.059 --> 2260.829
claim on it there was not identified in

2258.88 --> 2264.099
the description they're not honest

2260.829 --> 2265.3900000000003
critics no they're not and what did you

2264.099 --> 2269.6800000000003
think when rumpus the three-foot

2265.39 --> 2271.99
observer height well I talked to Beau

2269.68 --> 2273.1299999999997
who is the author I'm gonna be

2271.99 --> 2275.5299999999997
with him next week I'm going to

2273.13 --> 2277.839
California again for ten days I'm going

2275.53 --> 2285.46
to shoot the [ __ ] out of the oil

2277.839 --> 2287.619
platforms but you know he buh buh said

2285.46 --> 2289.089
that he was I think that there's two

2287.619 --> 2290.44
different references the one that you

2289.089 --> 2292.119
were referencing where he would where

2290.44 --> 2294.91
you what played it back and backwards

2292.119 --> 2296.6800000000003
and what when he was there I think that

2294.91 --> 2300.79
he's saying that he's one foot off the

2296.68 --> 2304.359
sand but he's at a higher elevation off

2300.79 --> 2306.13
the let off the water no I don't agree I

2304.359 --> 2308.98
think he's a four is no more than a four

2306.13 --> 2312.04
of the actual water no more than 1/4 you

2308.98 --> 2315.25
can you can see that you just know how I

2312.04 --> 2316.57
feel in in those locations you just know

2315.25 --> 2318.67
you just know when he's when he's

2316.57 --> 2320.5
lowering that camera down you just know

2318.67 --> 2325.7200000000003
that he's lowering it to about 1/4 if

2320.5 --> 2328.24
you guys their their critique is you've

2325.72 --> 2331.33
got a wave that's at least a foot high

2328.24 --> 2333.7299999999996
[ __ ] you know

2331.33 --> 2337.72
no it's not foot high I'm not saying

2333.73 --> 2343.2400000000002
it's about six inches but see right now

2337.72 --> 2345.43
is we're we're talking as a second as an

2343.24 --> 2347.77
observer because you're saying I would

2345.43 --> 2350.94
say it's about yeah but what they have

2347.77 --> 2352.96
to do is that from the cast aspersions

2350.94 --> 2354.58
alright so what they're doing is that

2352.96 --> 2356.4700000000003
they're taking us away from the

2354.58 --> 2360.609
observation and getting us talking about

2356.47 --> 2362.2599999999998
right it's no mystery as yeah as if

2360.609 --> 2364.06
three foot is gonna make all that's what

2362.26 --> 2366.9100000000003
I was gonna say right you still have the

2364.06 --> 2368.71
horizon issue the other thing is

2366.91 --> 2371.83
traversing the whole hangout of three

2368.71 --> 2373.93
hours they never once met referenced why

2371.83 --> 2376.5099999999998
the horizons behind the platforms

2373.93 --> 2378.73
rompers did start to get onto it and he

2376.51 --> 2380.71
did mention the word refraction and if

2378.73 --> 2382.9
that's the end of his explanation then

2380.71 --> 2384.609
that's nowhere near substantial because

2382.9 --> 2387.7000000000003
the refraction Inc that if the

2384.609 --> 2390.7599999999998
refraction includes sorry if the horizon

2387.7 --> 2393.91
includes refraction it moves from 1.2

2390.76 --> 2397.42
miles to 1.3 miles on their model it

2393.91 --> 2400.69
doesn't go to 10 it does on the infinite

2397.42 --> 2403.15
slider right oh by the way guys a slight

2400.69 --> 2405.7000000000003
correction on my part on technicality

2403.15 --> 2408.25
its diffraction it

2405.7 --> 2411.91
the word we originally started out with

2408.25 --> 2413.68
with I totally didn't get that word but

2411.91 --> 2417.0989999999997
it's diffraction not refraction

2413.68 --> 2420.52
refraction this marble refraction is

2417.099 --> 2423.069
more just the light shift by passing

2420.52 --> 2425.89
through the medium yes that always occur

2423.069 --> 2428.589
diffraction is the specific effect from

2425.89 --> 2431.74
close proximity also the cause in the

2428.589 --> 2434.319
wave pattern of the double slit close

2431.74 --> 2437.14
proximity to that surface that is the

2434.319 --> 2441.069
effect so the horizon is literally an

2437.14 --> 2444.04
optical effect caused by diffraction I'm

2441.069 --> 2446.44
certain of it now I or rather I actually

2444.04 --> 2449.68
know what means now I would I would

2446.44 --> 2452.38
disagree with that that's fine but I I

2449.68 --> 2456.3689999999997
figured it it's done is this Marvin show

2452.38 --> 2460.4500000000003
yes it is okay uh-huh yeah you can

2456.369 --> 2463.109
contest that on your own but I get it

2460.45 --> 2466.1189999999997
now I totally get what's going on now

2463.109 --> 2468.19
finally took me like two years because

2466.119 --> 2470.2000000000003
of diffraction I never really got it I

2468.19 --> 2471.7000000000003
knew there was a diffraction limit and

2470.2 --> 2474.1899999999996
all that in a camera I knew it was a

2471.7 --> 2477.22
thing but I just didn't really get what

2474.19 --> 2479.89
it was contacted oh I found really now I

2477.22 --> 2481.8999999999996
don't Jose's job you know I just watched

2479.89 --> 2490.0589999999997
that video back and I don't even think

2481.9 --> 2491.65
he's a full yeah it looked like he was

2490.059 --> 2494.8590000000004
right at the edge where the water comes

2491.65 --> 2496.839
up to yeah is he because he told me then

2494.859 --> 2499.119
he had to move his camera so it wouldn't

2496.839 --> 2501.91
get wet yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna retract

2499.119 --> 2504.339
my six six inch high of the wave and

2501.91 --> 2506.5589999999997
retract it down to a two inch height

2504.339 --> 2508.599
right that's the whole thing with

2506.559 --> 2510.309
perspective is that they do when they're

2508.599 --> 2512.6800000000003
looking at that wave to them it looks

2510.309 --> 2514.77
like it's larger but when you think when

2512.68 --> 2517.5299999999997
you take the angle and the distance into

2514.77 --> 2520.27
consideration you guys I think are

2517.53 --> 2523.9300000000003
correct to say that that's actually like

2520.27 --> 2526.329
a six inch wave yeah or whatever you

2523.93 --> 2528.0099999999998
think is me and Ron T of both I mean I

2526.329 --> 2529.9
went to the beach right don't forget

2528.01 --> 2532.2700000000004
right when I did my original amount

2529.9 --> 2534.25
video it was based on the claim of 35

2532.27 --> 2535.839
feet which turned out to be 47 feet

2534.25 --> 2537.88
right twelve feet difference not a

2535.839 --> 2538.93
hundred feet 12 feet difference that's

2537.88 --> 2541.9
all it was

2538.93 --> 2543.8489999999997
somebody it was it was either it was out

2541.9 --> 2546.64
of the rhombus or slice bar Cain said

2543.849 --> 2547.63
hey Riley it was sliced barking why

2546.64 --> 2549.46
don't you go back and get the same

2547.63 --> 2551.859
observation from the beach which is

2549.46 --> 2553.39
obviously 47 feet lower and when I went

2551.859 --> 2555.52
back to the beach and I lay on me belly

2553.39 --> 2557.17
in the wet sand I couldn't really get

2555.52 --> 2558.7599999999998
any lower to the water without digging a

2557.17 --> 2560.829
hole and letting the water pool around

2558.76 --> 2562.5690000000004
it right I'm not much above the water

2560.829 --> 2564.099
like that and he said I was about three

2562.569 --> 2566.2889999999998
feet above the water and I'm like no I

2564.099 --> 2568.0
think he said ten I can't remember I was

2566.289 --> 2569.71
literally in the wet sand and I'm like

2568.0 --> 2572.2
you guys are overtly dishonest and

2569.71 --> 2573.309
completely ignored the results that I

2572.2 --> 2574.39
got which was the ones that they

2573.309 --> 2576.25
challenged me to go and get from the

2574.39 --> 2578.109
beach which proves that it can't be a

2576.25 --> 2581.2
sphere but they'd rather argue that I

2578.109 --> 2582.8489999999997
wasn't at 1 4 3 4 rather than deal with

2581.2 --> 2584.6499999999996
the horizon point which was what I was

2582.849 --> 2586.839
making the video for and they're doing

2584.65 --> 2588.849
exactly the same again now the question

2586.839 --> 2592.0789999999997
is why is the horizon behind the tooter

2588.849 --> 2594.579
but the two platforms simple question I

2592.079 --> 2596.4700000000003
have an observation that's very similar

2594.579 --> 2598.9500000000003
to that where I actually rest the camera

2596.47 --> 2601.3289999999997
on the tripod and I film the whole thing

2598.95 --> 2603.22
and I'm going to say that that looks

2601.329 --> 2604.809
almost identical to what he does I'm

2603.22 --> 2606.819
just need to find it it's gonna take me

2604.809 --> 2608.44
a few it's gonna - I've got so much to

2606.819 --> 2610.569
go through but let me have a look see if

2608.44 --> 2614.529
I can bring that up at some point I

2610.569 --> 2616.45
might not and the other thing is blue

2614.529 --> 2618.19
marble science said on Jose's chart that

2616.45 --> 2619.75
he doesn't like these observations that

2618.19 --> 2622.75
are very close to the surface of the

2619.75 --> 2624.579
water but for the last 2 years they were

2622.75 --> 2626.289
always telling us to get gong-gong get

2624.579 --> 2628.299
the observation from like just above the

2626.289 --> 2630.039
waves and Riley and and that's what

2628.299 --> 2631.75
we've done so they can't change the

2630.039 --> 2633.4
globe pulse now and say because we're

2631.75 --> 2635.049
getting right on top of the water level

2633.4 --> 2636.4300000000003
the carrot now say that they don't like

2635.049 --> 2637.63
it because it doesn't support their

2636.43 --> 2639.609
assertion they were the ones that told

2637.63 --> 2640.6600000000003
us to get lower and mean Nathan was

2639.609 --> 2641.95
saying don't get lower you get it

2640.66 --> 2643.8999999999996
further into the dirt yeah

2641.95 --> 2645.5789999999997
but as Ramsey demonstrated you seemed to

2643.9 --> 2647.6800000000003
get underneath that date layer of dirt

2645.579 --> 2649.9
here now whatever's going on in the real

2647.68 --> 2652.45
world it doesn't mean that it's

2649.9 --> 2653.89
debunking us but it absolutely kills

2652.45 --> 2655.39
their argument when it doesn't match

2653.89 --> 2658.049
their narrative the narrative is

2655.39 --> 2658.049
complete horseshit

2663.15 --> 2669.01
they don't have much to come back with

2665.71 --> 2671.5
Diddy they just--they all the combat

2669.01 --> 2674.07
with is just at home personal attack all

2671.5 --> 2676.6
Riley's this run sees that I mean listen

2674.07 --> 2678.73
what we should be able to have

2676.6 --> 2680.65
conversations about this like adults but

2678.73 --> 2682.0
we can have it because all ever happens

2680.65 --> 2684.04
is it ends up being an at-home attack

2682.0 --> 2685.72
now we don't go in there calling people

2684.04 --> 2686.92
names we do call them when we're not

2685.72 --> 2688.6299999999997
when they're not to our face because

2686.92 --> 2690.46
they are lying but when we go in there

2688.63 --> 2692.08
we're going in there to try and see

2690.46 --> 2693.58
what's really going on they're not

2692.08 --> 2695.59
interested in what's really going on all

2693.58 --> 2697.9
they want to do is push me look at

2695.59 --> 2699.94
Brenda she will say ten times that a

2697.9 --> 2701.32
shoe is a phenomena as long as she keeps

2699.94 --> 2703.33
saying that issues a phenomena she's a

2701.32 --> 2704.65
phenomena fusion she's happy with that

2703.33 --> 2706.15
as long as the audience gets to hear

2704.65 --> 2708.04
that she's saying that no matter how

2706.15 --> 2710.5
many times we demonstrate that it's a

2708.04 --> 2711.91
concrete noun it's still if she can say

2710.5 --> 2714.13
it's a phenomena it's a phenomenal

2711.91 --> 2717.1
people will go away thinking that shoe

2714.13 --> 2719.26
might be a phenomena why it's a concrete

2717.1 --> 2721.0299999999997
now and it's not a phenomena yeah well

2719.26 --> 2722.98
they have an enable be very short-lived

2721.03 --> 2727.1200000000003
though you know it's Brenda is a

2722.98 --> 2729.4900000000002
complete buffoon and even her claiming

2727.12 --> 2733.42
issue to be a phenomena I find one of

2729.49 --> 2736.9599999999996
the lesser negative attributes of her

2733.42 --> 2739.69
person okay I personally find her just

2736.96 --> 2742.51
outright straight attacks at the start

2739.69 --> 2744.7000000000003
declaring hostility and saying that

2742.51 --> 2747.1000000000004
everything the opponent does is always

2744.7 --> 2749.68
nonsense I think that is much worse

2747.1 --> 2756.79
really I don't know at this point why

2749.68 --> 2758.2
anyone would allow her on ranty going

2756.79 --> 2759.4
over footage and I want to get back to

2758.2 --> 2761.98
it before we go to work but let me say

2759.4 --> 2765.54
one thing real quick besides thanks for

2761.98 --> 2769.9900000000002
giving me a call there their whole

2765.54 --> 2772.87
objection to taking footage whether it's

2769.99 --> 2775.45
one inch off the the water surface or

2772.87 --> 2777.97
whether it's five feet that whole

2775.45 --> 2780.1299999999997
argument gets thrown out the window when

2777.97 --> 2781.8399999999997
they want to appeal to their ships going

2780.13 --> 2784.3900000000003
over the curve because that's the only

2781.84 --> 2789.03
angle we ever get it at we don't we have

2784.39 --> 2791.5299999999997
it at I at viewer height so all of their

2789.03 --> 2794.5600000000004
posturing that they've got ships going

2791.53 --> 2795.9
over or even sound Lee's pontchartrain

2794.56 --> 2797.369
stuff that's

2795.9 --> 2802.38
all thrown out the window of you if you

2797.369 --> 2810.079
don't want to consider observations that

2802.38 --> 2812.279
low nobody see you later dude

2810.079 --> 2814.6800000000003
but they throw everything out the window

2812.279 --> 2818.039
in the first place by first imagining

2814.68 --> 2821.22
this this oversized refraction at this

2818.039 --> 2823.4100000000003
our fraction being a possibility and

2821.22 --> 2825.299
then just pointing on the slider

2823.41 --> 2827.609
wherever they needed to be in order to

2825.299 --> 2829.349
be a globe the size of the column for

2827.609 --> 2830.91
the slider are in the gun infinite

2829.349 --> 2832.4100000000003
slider it just means that they can just

2830.91 --> 2834.6299999999997
move that slider a little bit more and

2832.41 --> 2836.3089999999997
that explains it in their mind it's like

2834.63 --> 2838.1400000000003
they don't have to justify it they don't

2836.309 --> 2841.2000000000003
have to prove it they just get a slider

2838.14 --> 2845.069
and move it and say hello yes look hard

2841.2 --> 2846.48
without any proof it's our I just want

2845.069 --> 2851.549
to give a shout out to somebody in chat

2846.48 --> 2854.039
his name is matzah a lays mist yes

2851.549 --> 2856.17
yeah he said well he said this question

2854.039 --> 2858.329
was let me go back to it he says were

2856.17 --> 2860.76
you pleased with your award Anthony are

2858.329 --> 2862.079
you happy with your award matzah I asked

2860.76 --> 2863.5200000000004
her auntie and Nathan to plug it on

2862.079 --> 2865.1400000000003
their channel so that I could win it so

2863.52 --> 2867.329
that I could just hijack it and it

2865.14 --> 2869.0099999999998
worked so yeah I mean lated because it

2867.329 --> 2870.51
just demonstrates that this it's

2869.01 --> 2871.5890000000004
nonsense to be called the dumb [ __ ] by

2870.51 --> 2873.1800000000003
dumb [ __ ] it's actually a double

2871.589 --> 2877.17
negative and you know what they say

2873.18 --> 2879.75
about double negatives in our pies yeah

2877.17 --> 2881.73
I was plugging it a month before as soon

2879.75 --> 2882.99
as as soon as volting happened every

2881.73 --> 2884.01
time I went up Nathan well not every

2882.99 --> 2886.14
time but I would say at least three

2884.01 --> 2887.789
times on Nathan's I plugged it at least

2886.14 --> 2889.71
twice on my show I plugged it and I put

2887.789 --> 2891.8390000000004
a community post out asking people to go

2889.71 --> 2893.609
and vote for Tony and Nathan did it live

2891.839 --> 2895.44
on his show a couple of times all adds

2893.609 --> 2897.66
to the effect overall I think the

2895.44 --> 2899.339
difference was about 70 volts I'm going

2897.66 --> 2901.799
to claim that the difference of 70 volts

2899.339 --> 2903.839
was the point that that was caused by

2901.799 --> 2905.94
oles because we wanted to win it so that

2903.839 --> 2907.65
nobody else would I don't even know how

2905.94 --> 2909.059
the other people that were in it but if

2907.65 --> 2910.4700000000003
somebody else want it that would have

2909.059 --> 2911.9700000000003
been a mission fail for me so it's a bit

2910.47 --> 2915.75
of a gamble but I'm pleased that the

2911.97 --> 2917.069
results are positive hey guys a general

2915.75 --> 2919.289
question it's probably not down your

2917.069 --> 2922.68
lane though but I'm wondering you know

2919.289 --> 2925.23
about ray-tracing about 3d ray tracing

2922.68 --> 2928.12
modeling the visuals the emulation of

2925.23 --> 2934.4
reality and all that are the attempts

2928.12 --> 2936.7
has 3d modeling action in yeah in ray

2934.4 --> 2940.73
tracing progressed to the point where

2936.7 --> 2944.0
the diffraction effects are included

2940.73 --> 2946.04
like proper horizons no because the

2944.0 --> 2947.69
model don't know what I'm talking oh not

2946.04 --> 2952.7599999999998
talking about models I'm talking about

2947.69 --> 2955.79
actual 3d imagery visuals has that ever

2952.76 --> 2959.1200000000003
been occurred do they include the

2955.79 --> 2961.7599999999998
diffraction effect in the part in in the

2959.12 --> 2963.8599999999997
in the ray tracing calculations

2961.76 --> 2966.44
basically because if you just leave it

2963.86 --> 2968.0
out everything will still mostly be kind

2966.44 --> 2969.9500000000003
of the same you would still have just

2968.0 --> 2971.6
general reflections of reflective index

2969.95 --> 2975.1699999999996
and other I'm just wondering like has

2971.6 --> 2977.99
that also been included I I can't think

2975.17 --> 2980.48
of an example where I have seen a 3d

2977.99 --> 2984.14
rendering where that it did naturally

2980.48 --> 2986.0
form a horizon effect even if I was

2984.14 --> 2989.29
included they would just break the scale

2986.0 --> 2989.29
of it and they would they would

2989.8 --> 2995.75
disproportionate machinations I'm not

2992.6 --> 2998.69
talking and talking about just the the

2995.75 --> 3001.72
actual optical effect is diffraction

2998.69 --> 3005.62
included within ray tracing I don't know

3001.72 --> 3006.97
if it is but don't know now if yeah yes

3005.62 --> 3009.25
I said you guys probably don't know

3006.97 --> 3011.3799999999997
either but anyway I just want to

3009.25 --> 3013.21
reiterate my point that no baller is

3011.38 --> 3015.58
addressed why the horizon is behind the

3013.21 --> 3017.17
platforms they all answer questions that

3015.58 --> 3018.79
are not raised and then pretend that

3017.17 --> 3020.56
they've answered it I haven't seen

3018.79 --> 3022.81
anybody yet I've got one guy that's

3020.56 --> 3023.86
responded on my on one of my videos and

3022.81 --> 3025.2999999999997
I've pinned the comment and he's

3023.86 --> 3027.82
actually started with the words the

3025.3 --> 3029.53
horizon is and he's got halfway there

3027.82 --> 3031.1800000000003
and I'm like great would a free there

3029.53 --> 3032.5
now let's get the rest of it because we

3031.18 --> 3034.54
want to know why is it ten miles away

3032.5 --> 3035.71
right it's clearly behind the platforms

3034.54 --> 3037.09
we're not seeing a mirage there's a

3035.71 --> 3039.19
little bolt in between the two platforms

3037.09 --> 3040.6600000000003
and no ball is addressed it yeah and I

3039.19 --> 3042.7000000000003
want to know why not is it because you

3040.66 --> 3051.25
can't won't or you have to obfuscate the

3042.7 --> 3053.5
point so that it gets confused man it's

3051.25 --> 3057.43
a blast of a show today yeah thanks guys

3053.5 --> 3060.22
for being part of it cool still got five

3057.43 --> 3060.8799999999997
more minutes or so yeah so we got we've

3060.22 --> 3062.529
got Howard more

3060.88 --> 3065.7690000000002
refraction Anthony your refraction at

3062.529 --> 3068.19
1.2 miles away is basically zero doesn't

3065.769 --> 3072.4199999999996
account for why we see 10 miles

3068.19 --> 3078.069
refraction is insignificant negligible

3072.42 --> 3080.89
and yeah it doesn't it doesn't do it

3078.069 --> 3083.74
yeah it doesn't allow for a giant slider

3080.89 --> 3085.99
as it were it's just my new it can't

3083.74 --> 3088.569
ever really be bigger than that there's

3085.99 --> 3090.8489999999997
other effects that influence situations

3088.569 --> 3093.339
and concerning optics as well but the

3090.849 --> 3095.71
actual refraction is just minut and it

3093.339 --> 3098.41
can't be bigger than that but that's

3095.71 --> 3101.859
what the ballers assume because of our

3098.41 --> 3105.7
because it has to be for their model to

3101.859 --> 3109.0
work the infinite slider are we you need

3105.7 --> 3112.269
to remember that all right the infinite

3109.0 --> 3116.069
[ __ ] ohmmeter infinite slide it's

3112.269 --> 3118.39
the our refraction slider as where

3116.069 --> 3121.0589999999997
peanuts Clark says sleeping Mario who

3118.39 --> 3127.15
can challenge Bob Bob the science guy

3121.059 --> 3129.2200000000003
which Bobby referred to if it's Bob no

3127.15 --> 3132.21
Dell nobody can challenge Bob not

3129.22 --> 3138.6699999999996
allowed to challenge Bob doesn't like it

3132.21 --> 3141.73
hey I found it the video what what video

3138.67 --> 3144.339
video well I'm trying to find a video

3141.73 --> 3145.72
that matches his observation let me just

3144.339 --> 3152.019
see if I've got his observation up as

3145.72 --> 3153.8799999999997
well so hang on yeah this is this is it

3152.019 --> 3155.1699999999996
yeah so just bear with me I'm just gonna

3153.88 --> 3158.829
share this it'd only take a couple of

3155.17 --> 3162.579
minutes where are we happy you're a

3158.829 --> 3165.1600000000003
video yep my video and you know

3162.579 --> 3166.869
obviously this is the the guy that we're

3165.16 --> 3169.21
talking about his video so we're just

3166.869 --> 3170.859
gonna sort of like get an idea of what

3169.21 --> 3172.599
he does with the camera so we're just

3170.859 --> 3174.7
gonna play like ten seconds of this so

3172.599 --> 3176.619
right he said this is it the size is at

3174.7 --> 3178.24
the shore you see these little waves

3176.619 --> 3180.25
lapping up no more than a couple of

3178.24 --> 3182.589
inches and what he's gonna do is he's

3180.25 --> 3184.059
gonna you see the wave just plopping in

3182.589 --> 3185.47
and he's putting it right down on the

3184.059 --> 3186.849
edge of the water right so he's actually

3185.47 --> 3190.089
in the water right now

3186.849 --> 3191.7690000000002
see this little two-inch wave and then

3190.089 --> 3193.63
he moved the camera a tiny bit it's

3191.769 --> 3193.99
gonna go lower and lower and look how

3193.63 --> 3197.34
low

3193.99 --> 3200.29
is right so he's literally just

3197.34 --> 3201.2200000000003
centimeters above the water tone he's

3200.29 --> 3205.08
completely right

3201.22 --> 3207.1299999999997
I mean right an inch or so yeah and

3205.08 --> 3209.02
rhombus we'll always assert is at least

3207.13 --> 3210.85
three foot above so that's his

3209.02 --> 3213.1
observation and this is my observation

3210.85 --> 3214.72
and I'm going to put it on this rock so

3213.1 --> 3216.7599999999998
what I've done is I've I'm standing up

3214.72 --> 3218.6499999999996
right now and I'm hold this tripod here

3216.76 --> 3220.84
is set to twelve inches right so the

3218.65 --> 3224.07
tripod is at 12 inches and this rock is

3220.84 --> 3226.84
no more than a an inch above the water

3224.07 --> 3229.36
above the water out here we go so I'm

3226.84 --> 3232.15
gonna lower it onto this rock that's

3229.36 --> 3234.2400000000002
just for scale this is just for scale so

3232.15 --> 3238.63
now I'm gonna put it down on to the rock

3234.24 --> 3240.97
there we go and move it I'm gonna pop it

3238.63 --> 3244.54
on the rock and you watch it's the same

3240.97 --> 3248.6499999999996
effect just inches above the water come

3244.54 --> 3250.06
on put it on the rock let me scroll

3248.65 --> 3251.8
through a bit just so I get the point

3250.06 --> 3253.39
wet there you go there we go so I'm just

3251.8 --> 3257.4100000000003
gonna lower it onto the rock now sit on

3253.39 --> 3262.06
the rock there we go good son take Tony

3257.41 --> 3265.5099999999998
and and look at this thank you look at

3262.06 --> 3269.92
that same same exact effect and guess

3265.51 --> 3273.28
what and guess what we see buildings at

3269.92 --> 3275.38
80 miles away from just a pool of inches

3273.28 --> 3277.2400000000002
and ranted you remember when I actually

3275.38 --> 3279.31
made a little mat a little anthill out

3277.24 --> 3280.6299999999997
of the sand on the beach just so I

3279.31 --> 3282.91

loved it

3375.18 --> 3383.3399999999997
some good good old flat earth and some

3379.26 --> 3384.7200000000003
new figuring is out for me at least took

3383.34 --> 3387.21
me a long time to figure that out

3384.72 --> 3389.49
like what is that fraction what does it

3387.21 --> 3391.86
do how do I compare it well I kind of

3389.49 --> 3394.14
get what it is now I don't know why it

3391.86 --> 3396.57
works the way it does although I can

3394.14 --> 3400.3799999999997
kind of compare it to as I said bullet

3396.57 --> 3402.0
traveling past a surface and then it is

3400.38 --> 3404.82
equilibrium in the pressure surrounding

3402.0 --> 3406.86
it deflecting its pattern downward and

3404.82 --> 3409.71
that seems to be very much a good

3406.86 --> 3414.09
comparison to what their fraction does

3409.71 --> 3417.95
and it explains a lot so yeah great show

3414.09 --> 3421.05
