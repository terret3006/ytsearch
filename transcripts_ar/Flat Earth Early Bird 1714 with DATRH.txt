anyway weather today again is scorching

130.319 --> 133.57999999999998
it's really hot

134.7 --> 140.76
like there's absolutely no trace of the

137.76 --> 143.28
plow today and it's also almost wind

140.76 --> 145.5
still which just makes it so freaking

143.28 --> 147.3
hot

145.5 --> 150.18
oh

147.3 --> 152.70000000000002
plants are enjoying it fine enough but

150.18 --> 154.81900000000002
yeah also because I give them water a

152.7 --> 154.819
lot

155.16 --> 160.22
otherwise they'd dry out in no time

160.68 --> 165.019
mint is still exploding

169.67 --> 176.11999999999998
[Music]

172.379 --> 176.12
oh I'm sweating like

177.84 --> 181.20000000000002
uh like a hippo

180.1 --> 184.07999999999998
[Music]

181.2 --> 185.06
uh Zach this is no T-shirt heat but I

184.08 --> 187.739
just

185.06 --> 189.78
I'm trying not to do that because it

187.739 --> 191.70000000000002
just becomes too unbearable

189.78 --> 193.92
I don't even have any Illuminati because

191.7 --> 195.72
I well I do have one I'm just saving it

193.92 --> 197.7
for tomorrow because it's too hot to eat

195.72 --> 199.08
anything with this and I had a really

197.7 --> 201.0
decent meal yesterday

199.08 --> 203.54000000000002
[Music]

201.0 --> 203.54
ah

204.0 --> 211.519
uh anyway hello Terry 306 first in chat

207.84 --> 211.519
Dr utker good to see you both

215.22 --> 219.78
ABC homes

217.2 --> 221.76
what air conditioning

219.78 --> 225.56
uh it's not

221.76 --> 225.56
it no not typically

226.44 --> 229.92
there's some big office buildings that

228.299 --> 232.08
have air conditioning and all that but

229.92 --> 235.67999999999998
it's not like everybody has air

232.08 --> 237.84
conditioning here at all it's actually I

235.68 --> 240.019
think that Dutch kind of looked down on

237.84 --> 240.019
that

241.28 --> 247.98
because of the energy wasting and all

244.019 --> 249.0
that we like it would be unbearable like

247.98 --> 251.22
if

249.0 --> 254.659
electricity is so expensive here it's

251.22 --> 254.659
it's literally like

255.06 --> 258.32
people can't afford it

258.6 --> 261.079
so

261.299 --> 265.09999999999997
I'm not used to air conditioning

266.34 --> 270.35999999999996
I just find a good Shady spot I mean

268.62 --> 273.479
downstairs is much better temperature

270.36 --> 275.40000000000003
wise but yeah I'm not gonna like

273.479 --> 277.979
take an hour

275.4 --> 279.9
or like at least half an hour much more

277.979 --> 281.46
to this is it like a lot of time to

279.9 --> 283.25899999999996
disassemble my computer just so I could

281.46 --> 284.75899999999996
put it back together downstairs so I got

283.259 --> 286.44
to do a stream and then put it back

284.759 --> 289.1
together again above

286.44 --> 289.1
no

291.78 --> 295.82
what's the highest temperature

296.52 --> 300.78
Jesus

297.96 --> 303.18
45 what is that no it never gets that

300.78 --> 305.21999999999997
hot when it's that hot

303.18 --> 307.86
like things get scary then like

305.22 --> 310.199
everything starts to dry out now it's

307.86 --> 313.34000000000003
it's around 30 here and that's really

310.199 --> 313.34000000000003
hot for the Netherlands

318.919 --> 325.25899999999996
let's see what the temperature is

321.66 --> 329.24
probably a 28 right now

325.259 --> 329.24
should climb up to 31.

329.639 --> 332.3
ah

334.32 --> 338.039
sorry two Sunday according to this

336.66 --> 339.84000000000003
prediction

338.039 --> 342.18
we'll see at least they say it's going

339.84 --> 344.82
to be a bit more cloudy whatever

342.18 --> 347.759
I mean I'm all fine with this

344.82 --> 351.44
as long as I got some refreshments

347.759 --> 351.44
hello LSG good to see you

357.32 --> 361.28
nerd yes LSG

368.82 --> 374.4
Community Place effect yeah

372.0 --> 377.039
or there's plenty of humidity here the

374.4 --> 380.78
Netherlands is a watery country with a

377.039 --> 380.78
lot of rivers and lakes

381.6 --> 385.639
and it's Oceanside so

387.539 --> 393.0
usually it doesn't get that hot that's

390.06 --> 396.0
like Inland heat it doesn't really have

393.0 --> 398.94
like that sort of heat might happen

396.0 --> 400.56
in Germany if there's a heat wave then

398.94 --> 404.28
it can get like

400.56 --> 406.02
35 maybe 40. but that's that's kind of

404.28 --> 408.11999999999995
rare still

406.02 --> 410.94
Spain that's much more normal but it's

408.12 --> 413.36
that it's Mediterranean much closer to

410.94 --> 413.36
the Equator

413.94 --> 416.479
uh

417.3 --> 422.16
right anyway

419.22 --> 424.91900000000004
yeah I'm gonna just try to survive the

422.16 --> 426.12
heat because next hour Darth is going to

424.919 --> 429.0
join us

426.12 --> 431.46
we did a successful Skype sound test and

429.0 --> 433.74
everything yesterday

431.46 --> 435.919
and it's gonna come on so I'm really

433.74 --> 439.08
looking forward to that

435.919 --> 440.53999999999996
uh it's his first life

439.08 --> 442.62
stream by the way

440.54 --> 444.06
[Music]

442.62 --> 447.86
so

444.06 --> 447.86
he's excited about it I think

448.74 --> 453.66
I feel bad hey Ricky G

451.74 --> 456.24
you feel bad complaining about heat with

453.66 --> 458.03900000000004
turret around it don't it was born for

456.24 --> 461.34000000000003
that [ __ ] he's like

458.039 --> 464.3
they were born in that heat

461.34 --> 464.29999999999995
and he's brown

471.5 --> 477.8
they can adapt much easier because

474.36 --> 477.8
they're all born into that

479.58 --> 484.31899999999996
because it happens every year there like

481.919 --> 486.599
it definitely doesn't happen every year

484.319 --> 489.62
in

486.599 --> 489.62
in Middle Europe

501.0 --> 506.879
right so yeah I uh by the way notice

504.419 --> 508.56
just noticed that I think flat sword got

506.879 --> 511.68
his channel back

508.56 --> 514.02
cause it's named back to Flat Zoid

511.68 --> 515.399
lots of live streams have been removed

514.02 --> 518.2189999999999
though

515.399 --> 521.7
but it seems like he's got it back and

518.219 --> 524.94
we'll see what what he can restore

521.7 --> 528.12
I hope I really hope we can like uh yeah

524.94 --> 531.1400000000001
have those streams undeleted because

528.12 --> 533.94
he's had a lot of them and they were

531.14 --> 535.1999999999999
they were at times very interesting

533.94 --> 539.0600000000001
right

535.2 --> 539.0600000000001
so that's an update on that

552.36 --> 559.16
I'm gonna get this

556.26 --> 559.16
ah

562.14 --> 565.38
so

563.22 --> 567.9590000000001
please somebody

565.38 --> 570.48
donate to my PayPal because this is my

567.959 --> 573.06
last Gusto drink I would really like

570.48 --> 576.779
some Gusto energy drinks for

573.06 --> 579.68
Saturday and Sunday as well

576.779 --> 579.68
please help

579.86 --> 585.36
the Quran was one day somehow the

582.839 --> 588.44
e-bagging will stop

585.36 --> 591.12
because it won't be necessary anymore

588.44 --> 593.6
right anyway

591.12 --> 593.6
cheers

601.16 --> 605.64
to amaze me like the effect that has on

604.2 --> 606.899
me

605.64 --> 608.9399999999999
ah

606.899 --> 611.459
but indeed he in this type of heat

608.94 --> 612.1300000000001
taking a sip of this I mean it's like my

611.459 --> 614.279
eyes just

612.13 --> 617.279
[Music]

614.279 --> 617.279
great

618.24 --> 622.8
YouTube still seems to be having some

620.64 --> 624.959
weird camera stalling

622.8 --> 628.38
as long as the sound keeps going that's

624.959 --> 631.0799999999999
that's fine but it's still weird

628.38 --> 634.88
uh anybody else noticing that camera

631.08 --> 634.88
freezing or is it just me

638.04 --> 641.779
hey us see you

644.3 --> 652.8199999999999
wheatish rounds of stuff

649.86 --> 652.82
wheatish

653.64 --> 658.4399999999999
you yeah well yeah Brown

656.88 --> 661.98
bronze

658.44 --> 664.6400000000001
it's like Indians

661.98 --> 667.22
barracks

664.64 --> 671.76
hindustanis

667.22 --> 674.82
they're like copper color

671.76 --> 677.1
like a dark copper

674.82 --> 679.32
it's like a different type of shading

677.1 --> 681.72
it's like you have these different types

679.32 --> 684.6600000000001
of blacks in cloth right you have a

681.72 --> 686.519
black piece of cloth and then when it

684.66 --> 688.62
wears eventually you'll start to see

686.519 --> 691.98
what the origin color was

688.62 --> 695.12
whether it's blue or brown

691.98 --> 695.12
or sometimes green

696.899 --> 702.899
an Indian round is like red it's like

701.16 --> 704.88
this copper

702.899 --> 709.079
Brown

704.88 --> 711.959
well like mid African black

709.079 --> 716.279
is weirdly enough more blue type of

711.959 --> 718.079
black huh it's really like I can see the

716.279 --> 720.18
difference

718.079 --> 722.2199999999999
put an Indian next to like a middle

720.18 --> 725.54
Africa and you like can see like that's

722.22 --> 725.5400000000001
definitely a different color

725.64 --> 732.92
anybody else ever picked up on that

729.0 --> 732.92
it's all these different types of brown

733.68 --> 739.7399999999999
it's kind of funny because when they

735.54 --> 743.579
then well race mix with more white races

739.74 --> 745.92
you start to see that more it's like how

743.579 --> 748.399
they pale up it's like oh

745.92 --> 748.399
laughs

752.64 --> 761.3389999999999
it's like I can tell tell Indian

757.5 --> 763.079
uh races even when they mix up it was

761.339 --> 766.62
like what somebody is I can tell that

763.079 --> 768.54
apart like the more Asian Browns from

766.62 --> 771.36
the African rounds

768.54 --> 774.7199999999999
beside other features like lips and all

771.36 --> 778.04
that picture and that yeah

774.72 --> 778.0400000000001
skull shaped nose

784.92 --> 790.62
or slightly darker

787.44 --> 794.4590000000001
than me I am really white yes I am

790.62 --> 798.0
weirdly white I'm like I used to be like

794.459 --> 798.899
the pale guy that's also like yeah it's

798.0 --> 801.36
like

798.899 --> 804.079
oh I guess I'm goth

801.36 --> 808.04
and people would ask me sometimes well

804.079 --> 812.18
like do you wear makeup and I'm like no

808.04 --> 812.18
they're like oh

817.44 --> 822.9590000000001
because I would be so pale at times

820.2 --> 826.44
which by the way also was just bad blood

822.959 --> 829.56
flow from stress and [ __ ]

826.44 --> 831.5400000000001
from anxiety also makes you pale you

829.56 --> 834.06
know

831.54 --> 837.42
so I'm a lot less pale than I used to be

834.06 --> 840.42
thank God I like got more

837.42 --> 842.639
more of the

840.42 --> 844.62
the Asian

842.639 --> 848.72
yellow

844.62 --> 848.72
brownish type of skin

849.3 --> 853.8
but not as yellow as it could be like a

851.76 --> 855.06
u-step like a bit of yellow in there

853.8 --> 857.399
it's like

855.06 --> 861.7399999999999
Trace Chinese or something because I do

857.399 --> 861.74
have Chinese but it's very little bit

862.139 --> 865.88
less than the Indonesian

866.82 --> 872.399
have I ever seen a brown Indonesian yes

870.6 --> 874.9200000000001
absolutely

872.399 --> 878.1
and they look very much like

874.92 --> 882.12
people from India too the brown like

878.1 --> 883.86
they have the more East Asian type

882.12 --> 886.88
skull features

883.86 --> 891.019
then Indian which like are different

886.88 --> 891.019
still they like

891.199 --> 898.26
Indians and like Pakistani have more of

894.0 --> 899.399
that like Arab type skull features on

898.26 --> 902.899
average

899.399 --> 902.899
it's just different

904.32 --> 911.1
but yeah there's definitely very Brown

908.1 --> 911.1
Indonesians

912.12 --> 916.44
apparently they tend to pale up as they

914.279 --> 918.18
get older by the way that that's one

916.44 --> 921.48
thing

918.18 --> 922.9799999999999
never get darker

921.48 --> 925.86
and

922.98 --> 928.4590000000001
but yeah they can be pretty rich in

925.86 --> 928.4590000000001
melanine

929.399 --> 936.72
because like my grandmother

932.82 --> 939.839
from my dad's side like my dad's dad

936.72 --> 941.1
died relatively Young

939.839 --> 943.139
okay

941.1 --> 945.839
I don't know but he was like a very

943.139 --> 947.639
conflict like I got anger Outburst

945.839 --> 949.9200000000001
issues well I got that from my

947.639 --> 952.6800000000001
grandmother basically

949.92 --> 954.3
did which I didn't really know about him

952.68 --> 957.019
and he never like

954.3 --> 957.019
showed that

958.139 --> 963.3
but there were situations where it would

960.48 --> 965.6990000000001
go wrong apparently

963.3 --> 968.699
I personally never witnessed that with

965.699 --> 970.62
him with a few times that I actually saw

968.699 --> 973.139
my grandfather which is like three or

970.62 --> 977.339
four times total he died somewhere in my

973.139 --> 980.519
teens but like my grandmother got a new

977.339 --> 984.86
boyfriend which was like an Indonesian

980.519 --> 984.86
guy a full-on Indonesian guy

985.199 --> 991.019
oh like was a like a a fun family friend

989.1 --> 993.1800000000001
very easily

991.019 --> 994.68
and then he also unfortunately died and

993.18 --> 997.2589999999999
she kind of died

994.68 --> 999.66
recently after that because she was just

997.259 --> 1002.74
really alone

999.66 --> 1002.74
and she kind of old

1002.779 --> 1009.399
yeah got lots of family death

1006.56 --> 1009.399
but I mean it happens

1010.279 --> 1016.3389999999999
and with me it's just like

1012.74 --> 1019.899
within 10 years time like

1016.339 --> 1023.899
half of the family that I knew just died

1019.899 --> 1026.9
and that's like before the freaking that

1023.899 --> 1030.5
that's way before 2020.

1026.9 --> 1033.5
it all just happened in between 2005 and

1030.5 --> 1033.5
2015.

1033.86 --> 1041.4189999999999
roughly or even shorter between uh let's

1037.699 --> 1043.959
see my mother was two thousand

1041.419 --> 1043.959
six

1047.78 --> 1054.559
it was between two thousand

1050.84 --> 1057.9189999999999
six in 2012. like so many people died

1054.559 --> 1061.34
from my family then

1057.919 --> 1063.44
and it made me feel like like my entire

1061.34 --> 1066.08
family is like they're all just falling

1063.44 --> 1069.14
over it was [ __ ] up because I was also

1066.08 --> 1073.48
well engaging with this

1069.14 --> 1073.48
Satanism crap sort of

1074.419 --> 1079.46
I did like fear that is this happening

1077.36 --> 1080.539
because of what I'm doing I was really

1079.46 --> 1082.82
afraid

1080.539 --> 1085.78
that I was like responsible for all this

1082.82 --> 1085.78
happening somehow

1087.74 --> 1092.36
in ways and at the same time ignoring

1090.08 --> 1096.039
that as well it's like oh pretty wild

1092.36 --> 1096.039
ride on the inside of my head

1107.72 --> 1110.66
and by the way with my brother as well

1109.7 --> 1114.38
like

1110.66 --> 1116.72
his dad also died like three years after

1114.38 --> 1120.1000000000001
my mom

1116.72 --> 1120.1000000000001
because he's my half brother right

1124.76 --> 1128.559
but he has his own family now

1138.26 --> 1141.28
Halo fruit

1143.919 --> 1148.539
head into the star what

1149.059 --> 1153.44
yeah by the way whoever recommended

1150.98 --> 1156.08
yesterday that documentary like the

1153.44 --> 1159.3200000000002
other side of AIDS it's a really good

1156.08 --> 1161.86
documentary but I couldn't watch past

1159.32 --> 1165.559
half of it there was just too many

1161.86 --> 1167.4799999999998
raging gay testimony there and it was it

1165.559 --> 1172.16
was literally like making me nauseous

1167.48 --> 1176.059
it's like okay yeah yeah I I don't want

1172.16 --> 1177.98
that spiritual matter that uh

1176.059 --> 1182.06
so I just

1177.98 --> 1185.17
I had to stop but it was very thorough

1182.06 --> 1185.1699999999998
[Music]

1185.419 --> 1191.98
is just my homophobia played up a bit so

1188.96 --> 1191.98
I couldn't finish it

1200.48 --> 1203.419
the size of the Moon in front of the

1202.28 --> 1207.2
Earth

1203.419 --> 1208.76
yes I yeah yeah I I basically reviewed

1207.2 --> 1210.74
that on the spot

1208.76 --> 1211.64
there it yesterday I didn't show the

1210.74 --> 1214.64
picture

1211.64 --> 1217.1000000000001
but I did talk about it when you posted

1214.64 --> 1218.72
that link ridiculous it's like oval

1217.1 --> 1221.9599999999998
Earth

1218.72 --> 1224.24
like idiotic like I think that they

1221.96 --> 1226.28
thought they were showing like the moon

1224.24 --> 1228.559
was behind the Earth

1226.28 --> 1230.24
but it was illogical because then the

1228.559 --> 1232.7
Earth would not be a ball it would be a

1230.24 --> 1235.039
weird oval or an egg

1232.7 --> 1238.22
but they just

1235.039 --> 1240.14
so I think you were mistaken about it

1238.22 --> 1241.88
being in front of Earth it was supposed

1240.14 --> 1243.88
to be behind the Earth but the Earth was

1241.88 --> 1248.2
just egg shapes

1243.88 --> 1248.2
it's ridiculous either way

1256.039 --> 1259.0
right Tarot

1260.66 --> 1263.74
did you get that

1264.679 --> 1268.3600000000001
a video keeps freezing up

1277.6 --> 1280.7199999999998
all right

1282.5 --> 1285.5
foreign

1298.25 --> 1301.42
[Music]

1310.24 --> 1313.78
keeps freezing up

1315.26 --> 1320.08
I mean it's just a video but it's still

1317.24 --> 1320.08
very distracting

1321.26 --> 1327.02
like I during the show I do keep track

1323.9 --> 1330.38
of like what I'm doing just to like know

1327.02 --> 1332.96
of like how I'm framed on the camera

1330.38 --> 1334.22
I have to keep seeing myself to see if

1332.96 --> 1336.44
I'm not like

1334.22 --> 1338.1200000000001
if something isn't wrong so it's very

1336.44 --> 1339.5
annoying to me when it freezes up

1338.12 --> 1342.4599999999998
continually

1339.5 --> 1342.46
but uh anyway

1351.559 --> 1356.36
you never get it with QE but with me

1354.26 --> 1359.12
Nathan and flat side well that makes

1356.36 --> 1361.6399999999999
sense Richard G in a ways there's a

1359.12 --> 1365.1399999999999
pattern there what's the pattern well QE

1361.64 --> 1365.14
doesn't stream live every day

1365.539 --> 1371.12
he streams

1367.58 --> 1375.52
on average once a week no that's yeah

1371.12 --> 1378.9799999999998
one and a half times a week so

1375.52 --> 1381.5
but me flat side and Nathan we stream

1378.98 --> 1384.32
every day so that makes more sense that

1381.5 --> 1386.24
we would be subjected to some

1384.32 --> 1389.12
some kind of thing that's causing this

1386.24 --> 1392.98
constant stall and kiwi wouldn't because

1389.12 --> 1392.9799999999998
he's not a continual burden

1394.4 --> 1399.3200000000002
running perfectly for you Oz okay

1397.4 --> 1403.24
great

1399.32 --> 1403.24
I'm glad it's not everybody then

1410.36 --> 1419.74
if you get times and your PC this is

1415.88 --> 1419.74
what the issue of that stuff

1421.159 --> 1424.8400000000001
I don't know what you're talking about

1434.84 --> 1441.02
I have no issues with my PC and I have

1437.96 --> 1442.94
it checked like I have my ways to check

1441.02 --> 1446.78
it

1442.94 --> 1448.52
and I I I know how my computer works I

1446.78 --> 1450.08
know when something is happening as an

1448.52 --> 1452.78
anomaly

1450.08 --> 1454.82
I know when some weird hacking [ __ ]

1452.78 --> 1458.3799999999999
could potentially be taking place and I

1454.82 --> 1458.3799999999999
know what to do about it when it does

1459.32 --> 1463.34
it's a good reason that my computer's

1461.179 --> 1466.5800000000002
never really been hacked

1463.34 --> 1468.559
like one time because of a stupid guy

1466.58 --> 1471.1399999999999
calling on the phone and me panicking

1468.559 --> 1474.86
and doing what he said and [ __ ] my

1471.14 --> 1477.919
computer and then I even like I just

1474.86 --> 1480.559
reset it like undid

1477.919 --> 1483.38
redid like a previous setting and it was

1480.559 --> 1485.24
all all fixed so that's the only time

1483.38 --> 1487.88
sort of close to me getting hacked

1485.24 --> 1490.4
because I was panicking like and that's

1487.88 --> 1493.2800000000002
never gonna happen like I just know now

1490.4 --> 1496.22
nobody ever calls you up about your

1493.28 --> 1499.34
computer ever like that never ever

1496.22 --> 1501.799
happens it only happens if you

1499.34 --> 1503.9599999999998
called some technical thing

1501.799 --> 1507.1399999999999
and have an appointment for them calling

1503.96 --> 1508.64
you back that's the only reason ever why

1507.14 --> 1511.159
somebody would call you about your

1508.64 --> 1515.1200000000001
computer because nobody ever does that

1511.159 --> 1517.18
and I know that now foreign

1515.12 --> 1520.369
anyway

1517.18 --> 1520.3690000000001
[Music]

1535.34 --> 1540.08
yeah and I've never get like [ __ ]

1538.1 --> 1541.76
virus scanner slow fruit you know where

1540.08 --> 1545.6
you get viruses from

1541.76 --> 1548.36
in your computer from virus scanners

1545.6 --> 1551.4189999999999
did you know that since I like it's just

1548.36 --> 1553.279
like the freaking vaccines man it's not

1551.419 --> 1555.919
even a joke

1553.279 --> 1558.58
because I don't think it's that funny

1555.919 --> 1558.5800000000002
but

1559.64 --> 1567.26
the second I stopped using viral decided

1563.419 --> 1570.3200000000002
to like never use virus scanners again I

1567.26 --> 1574.179
never had anything remotely close to

1570.32 --> 1574.1789999999999
having an issue with some kind of virus

1574.82 --> 1580.82
and I had been using them for like a

1577.46 --> 1583.82
decade and I did have issues sometimes

1580.82 --> 1586.22
and like oh [ __ ] I have to quickly reset

1583.82 --> 1588.08
for because my browser is like all stuck

1586.22 --> 1592.3600000000001
in something

1588.08 --> 1592.36
and that never happens anymore now

1595.1 --> 1599.6789999999999
uh

1596.84 --> 1599.6789999999999
so yeah

1606.74 --> 1611.36
I mean I

1608.36 --> 1615.1999999999998
if you're gonna have some like public

1611.36 --> 1617.4189999999999
computer or some Industrial Service or

1615.2 --> 1620.059
like a government function yeah then

1617.419 --> 1622.279
that's a different story right

1620.059 --> 1624.9189999999999
because you're gonna have like active

1622.279 --> 1628.179
targets

1624.919 --> 1630.919
it's more likely people will

1628.179 --> 1633.74
invest to try to meddle for some

1630.919 --> 1636.76
political reason or one another with me

1633.74 --> 1636.76
it's just not

1637.4 --> 1640.659
like what's the point

1641.84 --> 1646.34
I'm like an e-begger who tells stories

1644.24 --> 1648.02
and I don't have that much broad

1646.34 --> 1650.4189999999999
attention it's like

1648.02 --> 1652.4
I don't think I'm really a risk to like

1650.419 --> 1655.039
the the dumb public

1652.4 --> 1657.02
for the programmers it's like I

1655.039 --> 1660.7
I'm too far out of their reach they're

1657.02 --> 1660.7
not really gonna listen to me anyway

1662.299 --> 1668.48
like they're all stuck in their own

1666.44 --> 1670.5800000000002
sub mainstream

1668.48 --> 1675.08
not so obviously it's not so obvious

1670.58 --> 1678.5
establishment narratives like the the

1675.08 --> 1680.779
altar like oh the counter news narrative

1678.5 --> 1682.46
they're all stuck in that [ __ ] they're

1680.779 --> 1684.2
not gonna listen to what I say because

1682.46 --> 1686.98
I'm telling them like no that's just

1684.2 --> 1686.98
another layer

1687.44 --> 1690.88
they can't handle that [ __ ]

1705.44 --> 1708.52
what is that link

1709.1 --> 1714.1999999999998
the YouTube video no

1712.1 --> 1716.779
what

1714.2 --> 1719.96
eh

1716.779 --> 1721.34
yeah it isn't that Terry

1719.96 --> 1724.039
ship

1721.34 --> 1726.74
I know that's why I call it like the

1724.039 --> 1729.7
Atari graphics

1726.74 --> 1729.7
moon landing

1733.52 --> 1737.779
like I'm not the first one to say that I

1735.86 --> 1740.4799999999998
just picked up on it quickly I felt like

1737.779 --> 1743.08
yes that's what I'm gonna say that's

1740.48 --> 1743.08
great

1745.0 --> 1749.559
because everybody does get that

1751.46 --> 1755.14
hey lumpy gas and vacuum

1766.76 --> 1771.1589999999999
definitely wasn't an Atari game

1772.7 --> 1777.7
whatever

1774.86 --> 1781.58
it's a terrier maybe it's like a

1777.7 --> 1783.6200000000001
Schneider or a Commodore 64 game or or

1781.58 --> 1785.96
an arcade game

1783.62 --> 1789.02
from that time who knows

1785.96 --> 1791.48
it's like it's at when was Atari really

1789.02 --> 1792.6399999999999
great it was like in the super early age

1791.48 --> 1794.539
before

1792.64 --> 1798.7990000000002
[Music]

1794.539 --> 1802.8799999999999
like Nintendo started it's so Atari was

1798.799 --> 1804.46
like the standard of the 70s and the 80s

1802.88 --> 1807.98
it really was

1804.46 --> 1810.02
and then in the 80s like Commodore and

1807.98 --> 1813.6200000000001
Nintendo started

1810.02 --> 1817.34
was Nintendo like 90s whatever

1813.62 --> 1820.039
so Atari is like is a specific marker

1817.34 --> 1821.6
for an era and that's why it works so

1820.039 --> 1824.6
well calling it that because it like

1821.6 --> 1828.4599999999998
indicates the era of the graphics that's

1824.6 --> 1828.4599999999998
more important the association

1834.44 --> 1838.6000000000001
slightly too good for artery I know

1836.299 --> 1842.4189999999999
Atari was [ __ ] ugly

1838.6 --> 1845.299
like yeah I've watched Angry Video Game

1842.419 --> 1849.159
Nerd reviews he reviews Atari [ __ ] all

1845.299 --> 1852.02
the time and it is really ugly yeah

1849.159 --> 1855.0800000000002
colored blocks just a couple of colors

1852.02 --> 1857.059
and you can literally like

1855.08 --> 1859.039
it just feels like it's built out of

1857.059 --> 1862.299
Legos

1859.039 --> 1862.299
Atari graphics

1862.82 --> 1867.1399999999999
and the sound is atrocious but I mean

1864.919 --> 1870.3200000000002
yeah it was like the first

1867.14 --> 1873.5200000000002
computer games ever

1870.32 --> 1873.52
that's how that started

1874.22 --> 1879.039
like directly after pong

1880.94 --> 1885.5
you got pong

1882.62 --> 1889.34
and then you got Atari and Atari really

1885.5 --> 1892.94
invented the very concept of like

1889.34 --> 1896.069
themed video games they invented that

1892.94 --> 1896.069
[Music]

1896.48 --> 1899.08
ah

1900.559 --> 1906.46
it's an Indian Graphics photo no [ __ ]

1902.96 --> 1906.46
ours yeah

1910.47 --> 1913.66
[Music]

1920.36 --> 1923.62
oh my God so

1924.5 --> 1929.659
It's really because there's just no wind

1926.419 --> 1931.5200000000002
it's like I can't see a single leaf on a

1929.659 --> 1933.44
tree moving it's that wind still it's

1931.52 --> 1937.1589999999999
really rare

1933.44 --> 1941.38
this is like the most wind still they

1937.159 --> 1941.38
in this entire mini heat wave

1944.899 --> 1947.62
ugh

1951.62 --> 1957.62
I I had that fan thing this time

1955.76 --> 1959.299
even though the noise of that was

1957.62 --> 1962.299
atrocious

1959.299 --> 1962.299
foreign

1968.5 --> 1971.919
use this

1974.48 --> 1978.039
let's give it a try

1979.34 --> 1986.62
hope my computer doesn't crash

1982.899 --> 1986.62
oh dust

1991.1 --> 1996.58
ah here we go

1993.799 --> 1996.58
ah

1998.299 --> 2001.559
sorry about the noise

2008.679 --> 2013.6000000000001
okay here to enjoy it while no I am

2011.2 --> 2015.82
enjoying it definitely

2013.6 --> 2017.86
like I am happy that this little Heat

2015.82 --> 2021.48
Wave happened

2017.86 --> 2021.4799999999998
I've been thankful all the time

2022.0 --> 2026.399
but it's yeah I mean it's still hot

2028.36 --> 2032.9189999999999
but like soaking up the sun I do feel

2030.58 --> 2035.4399999999998
it's like like all kinds of vitamins are

2032.919 --> 2036.5800000000002
doing the connecting and being formed

2035.44 --> 2039.24
and [ __ ]

2036.58 --> 2039.24
so

2039.84 --> 2045.519
and my mood is like significantly

2042.46 --> 2047.32
improving with the sunlight it really is

2045.519 --> 2049.599
there's something about waking up with

2047.32 --> 2052.54
like a clear blue sky day it's just that

2049.599 --> 2055.3
really like yes

2052.54 --> 2058.599
but then it's like oh it's hot but still

2055.3 --> 2061.619
that yes that's still underneath there

2058.599 --> 2061.619
and it stays

2062.08 --> 2066.2799999999997
and then usually the problem is that

2064.0 --> 2068.8
it'll just lasts the entire night and

2066.28 --> 2072.8390000000004
then I have trouble going to bed

2068.8 --> 2072.8390000000004
because the temperature is so doable

2076.48 --> 2080.44
right

2078.7 --> 2082.54
and it's like during the daytime it's

2080.44 --> 2083.859
real when it's this hot it's for me it's

2082.54 --> 2088.02
tough to eat

2083.859 --> 2088.02
it's just too warm

2091.899 --> 2094.5
anyway

2094.659 --> 2098.98
found out that the ex-indian cricket

2097.3 --> 2103.2400000000002
captain

2098.98 --> 2108.04
greatest Captain Ms Donny

2103.24 --> 2111.4199999999996
has flown to USA and was invited to play

2108.04 --> 2113.2
golf with Donald Trump

2111.42 --> 2115.92
wow

2113.2 --> 2115.9199999999996
okay

2121.66 --> 2124.92
cool I guess

2136.34 --> 2139.4790000000003
[Music]

2142.54 --> 2147.099
yeah Dr Shiva is really crushing it by

2145.06 --> 2149.02
the way out there

2147.099 --> 2151.06
he just keeps going and going and making

2149.02 --> 2152.98
good Clips too

2151.06 --> 2154.66
summer eclipse of what he's talking

2152.98 --> 2157.3
about but it's like having all these

2154.66 --> 2159.3999999999996
people over or like doing shows with

2157.3 --> 2161.8590000000004
people it's it's fascinating

2159.4 --> 2165.599
like I also people I just recognize

2161.859 --> 2165.5989999999997
through like the Alex Jones network

2166.42 --> 2172.599
spot on about Tucker Carson indeed

2170.5 --> 2176.2
I agree

2172.599 --> 2179.2000000000003
but Tucker like oh God sometimes like

2176.2 --> 2181.4199999999996
Alex Jones like to likes to be like oh

2179.2 --> 2184.5989999999997
he's so great and he says oh talker is

2181.42 --> 2186.52
so smart it's horseshit he's not [ __ ]

2184.599 --> 2188.6400000000003
smart at all

2186.52 --> 2188.64
thank you

2190.54 --> 2194.52
he's like a memorizer guy

2197.68 --> 2202.24
but like Tucker

2199.96 --> 2204.88
like asking about something that he's

2202.24 --> 2207.9399999999996
not studied into and he's probably like

2204.88 --> 2209.6800000000003
just doesn't know what to say like I

2207.94 --> 2212.14
think he's that type I don't know maybe

2209.68 --> 2213.64
he has changed over the years I mean

2212.14 --> 2216.5789999999997
he's been doing it for a while maybe

2213.64 --> 2218.7999999999997
he's climbing out of that but

2216.579 --> 2220.119
from what I heard like Tucker is really

2218.8 --> 2222.099
not smart

2220.119 --> 2225.7200000000003
he's just like

2222.099 --> 2225.7200000000003
A brotherhood guy

2228.339 --> 2232.7799999999997
and like with the Brotherhood

2230.619 --> 2234.6400000000003
I mean the not so obvious establishment

2232.78 --> 2237.28
I call it the Brotherhood because they

2234.64 --> 2239.2599999999998
are like a guild among one another like

2237.28 --> 2240.94
they promote each other they protect

2239.26 --> 2242.8
each other they

2240.94 --> 2247.359
give better viewers still creative

2242.8 --> 2250.2400000000002
criticism but never like

2247.359 --> 2252.16
like it's they will never really kick

2250.24 --> 2254.4399999999996
somebody out permanently so there's been

2252.16 --> 2256.06
super hard criticism on Trump too like

2254.44 --> 2258.7000000000003
on Alex Jones Show

2256.06 --> 2260.619
but then they'll just still like they'll

2258.7 --> 2263.859
still just roll out their promotions

2260.619 --> 2265.839
like it never happened and then and then

2263.859 --> 2268.54
also criticize it in between it's weird

2265.839 --> 2270.7599999999998
but that's how I feel like the

2268.54 --> 2272.56
Brotherhood does things

2270.76 --> 2275.2200000000003
and Alex Jones is like in the middle of

2272.56 --> 2275.22
it he's like

2277.06 --> 2283.0
like the Brotherhood dating guy

2280.359 --> 2285.22
it's like he just likes to invite people

2283.0 --> 2287.44
into the Brotherhood and that's what he

2285.22 --> 2290.2599999999998
says is like on his side like oh Joe

2287.44 --> 2291.52
Rogan is really getting to my side and

2290.26 --> 2294.94
like

2291.52 --> 2297.88
I wonder if Alex really understands what

2294.94 --> 2299.859
he is doing that he is effectively

2297.88 --> 2302.1400000000003
managing with

2299.859 --> 2304.359
the not so obvious establishment

2302.14 --> 2305.74
if he's like really conscious of that I

2304.359 --> 2309.64
wonder

2305.74 --> 2311.74
don't know no don't know for sure

2309.64 --> 2313.7799999999997
but he has a lot of like super

2311.74 --> 2315.8799999999997
distasteful

2313.78 --> 2317.92
things that he does and he's picked up

2315.88 --> 2321.04
on that for a while

2317.92 --> 2323.98
where he's just really distasteful with

2321.04 --> 2327.46
things like he swears at moments where

2323.98 --> 2329.7400000000002
it's just super inappropriate

2327.46 --> 2332.579
completely unnecessary

2329.74 --> 2332.5789999999997
and

2340.44 --> 2347.079
just uh I just don't want to keep

2343.98 --> 2349.06
harping on about it there's so much that

2347.079 --> 2351.1600000000003
freaking annoys me about Infowars these

2349.06 --> 2352.2999999999997
days and it has been for a while and

2351.16 --> 2354.52
then you think it's like oh they're

2352.3 --> 2356.26
finally over that and they're just doing

2354.52 --> 2358.96
the same thing again

2356.26 --> 2362.6400000000003
promoting another new guy pretending to

2358.96 --> 2362.64
be some kind of Savior and then

2364.0 --> 2368.32
they're much more care like they are

2365.98 --> 2370.54
criticizing though

2368.32 --> 2373.119
it's just so weird like on one hand like

2370.54 --> 2375.16
oh promoting them and then on the other

2373.119 --> 2376.839
hand like can we really trust him well

2375.16 --> 2379.06
we don't really have a choice that kind

2376.839 --> 2381.22
of attitude

2379.06 --> 2384.5789999999997
it's like let's be vigilant and if he

2381.22 --> 2386.4399999999996
steps out of line then well then what

2384.579 --> 2388.119
what do you do when somebody you just

2386.44 --> 2391.2000000000003
helped into Power suddenly steps out

2388.119 --> 2391.2000000000003
like what are you gonna do then

2391.66 --> 2395.46
uh

2392.92 --> 2395.46
anyway

2401.079 --> 2405.28
you guys are just talking about the moon

2403.48 --> 2408.96
landing stuff

2405.28 --> 2408.96
ignoring what I'm talking about

2410.32 --> 2412.8590000000004
enough

2442.0 --> 2447.579
yet look Jared why why do you think they

2445.18 --> 2450.0989999999997
didn't do that

2447.579 --> 2452.02
why do you think they didn't build a a

2450.099 --> 2454.119
studio in a warehouse somewhere like

2452.02 --> 2458.2599999999998
they did with the American moon landing

2454.119 --> 2460.119
because it's so much more expensive yeah

2458.26 --> 2464.46
secrecy

2460.119 --> 2464.46
is really expensive you see

2467.859 --> 2472.54
you have to bribe a bunch of people that

2470.2 --> 2474.46
have to hold that secret in for a long

2472.54 --> 2477.96
time and then you have to keep track of

2474.46 --> 2477.96
that Keeping a Secret

2478.06 --> 2484.2
in a government is very freaking

2480.52 --> 2488.38
expensive and by making it All Digital

2484.2 --> 2491.4399999999996
you specifically cost cut down on those

2488.38 --> 2494.38
costs because there's no physical stage

2491.44 --> 2497.32
that should mustn't be allowed to be

2494.38 --> 2499.1800000000003
known that it existed you see it's so

2497.32 --> 2502.54
much cheaper that way

2499.18 --> 2506.22
it's much less spectacular of course

2502.54 --> 2506.22
but that is how that works

2507.16 --> 2512.0989999999997
how's my day hot very very hot

2516.099 --> 2521.32
but what's the point right the point is

2518.74 --> 2525.0989999999997
to be part of the game

2521.32 --> 2528.339
right it's a virtue signal

2525.099 --> 2533.52
it's a virtue signal to

2528.339 --> 2533.52
to the the space dream of the West

2534.579 --> 2539.8
because they're the ones that started it

2537.339 --> 2542.32
so that is like that is the silly thing

2539.8 --> 2544.42
about the whole India space launch right

2542.32 --> 2548.1400000000003
and they're like oh oh we're gonna move

2544.42 --> 2550.119
away from British nationalism like oh we

2548.14 --> 2552.2799999999997
don't want to be Colonial anymore we're

2550.119 --> 2554.32
gonna change the name and oh this is all

2552.28 --> 2555.94
in the news now

2554.32 --> 2558.76
uh

2555.94 --> 2560.94
well ironically they're literally like

2558.76 --> 2564.1600000000003
making their government

2560.94 --> 2565.78
become Colonial more than ever by doing

2564.16 --> 2567.94
this

2565.78 --> 2571.6600000000003
while their virtue signaling against

2567.94 --> 2574.66
colonialism they're literally letting

2571.66 --> 2577.54
a religion space

2574.66 --> 2580.24
dominate in their country that is

2577.54 --> 2583.06
literally like the founding country of

2580.24 --> 2586.9799999999996
one of the oldest religions in the world

2583.06 --> 2586.98
this is very typical isn't it

2605.28 --> 2609.1600000000003
I mean

2607.839 --> 2612.22
I don't think it would have been

2609.16 --> 2615.22
possible but I mean how much more cool

2612.22 --> 2616.7799999999997
would it have been if India instead

2615.22 --> 2619.66
would like

2616.78 --> 2623.3190000000004
with regard to the religions that are

2619.66 --> 2626.859
dominant in India right which are

2623.319 --> 2628.42
mostly Hinduism and Islam well both of

2626.859 --> 2632.14
those religions

2628.42 --> 2636.579
very much have like

2632.14 --> 2638.92
reason to side with flat Earth so India

2636.579 --> 2643.54
could have also basically like broken

2638.92 --> 2647.44
off with the westernism and said no we

2643.54 --> 2649.839
officially declare Earth is flat

2647.44 --> 2651.579
and it's all space is fake they could

2649.839 --> 2655.0
have done that and they would have like

2651.579 --> 2658.7200000000003
really like created actual Indian

2655.0 --> 2661.72
Nationalism if they'd done that

2658.72 --> 2664.18
because that would reinvigorate the

2661.72 --> 2666.8799999999997
religions

2664.18 --> 2669.06
and it would have even like cut down on

2666.88 --> 2669.06
the

2670.66 --> 2676.18
they would have cut down on the tensions

2672.52 --> 2679.859
between the two because nationalism

2676.18 --> 2683.319
will direct any like hostile Tendencies

2679.859 --> 2686.4
towards the outside instead of

2683.319 --> 2686.4
towards your neighbor

2688.06 --> 2694.74
but yeah it wasn't meant to be

2690.88 --> 2694.7400000000002
they're doing the opposite

2698.38 --> 2700.8
uh

2700.9 --> 2703.079
foreign

2733.359 --> 2738.52
I assume it's from the nobody's saying

2736.42 --> 2740.7400000000002
that it's literally footage from that

2738.52 --> 2744.48
tarry game turret

2740.74 --> 2744.4799999999996
nobody's actually saying that

2745.06 --> 2749.0789999999997
if they are they're just blabbermouthing

2747.16 --> 2751.1189999999997
idiots because that's literally

2749.079 --> 2753.6400000000003
ridiculous like it's not literally the

2751.119 --> 2756.7000000000003
Atari Graphics it's just

2753.64 --> 2759.819
the graphics is so poor in comparison to

2756.7 --> 2762.9399999999996
what it could be

2759.819 --> 2764.92
and thus they say Atari and it kind of

2762.94 --> 2768.819
reminds them of the

2764.92 --> 2770.859
the little Galaga

2768.819 --> 2774.7599999999998
fighter

2770.859 --> 2778.619
that you control in that game Gallagher

2774.76 --> 2778.619
doesn't mean so just

2794.68 --> 2801.339
not seriously the landing footage was

2797.619 --> 2804.579
intended to look real what since what

2801.339 --> 2806.5
are you talking about Orinoco Wombo

2804.579 --> 2808.96
who is a baller by the way so this is

2806.5 --> 2812.4
weird to hear this are you saying like

2808.96 --> 2812.4
of course it was fake

2812.44 --> 2814.92
what

2820.06 --> 2823.74
no the Indian Lander

2826.3 --> 2833.819
all this showed was just a bunch of CDI

2830.98 --> 2833.819
that's it

2844.48 --> 2847.2
right now

2854.44 --> 2857.65
[Music]

2871.35 --> 2877.179
[Music]

2880.3 --> 2885.28
[Music]

2882.4 --> 2889.7400000000002
oh finally then sun has stopped hitting

2885.28 --> 2889.7400000000002
the wall here it's still cooking

2890.92 --> 2895.56
right I wonder when Darth is going to

2893.26 --> 2895.5600000000004
show up

2898.359 --> 2903.22
we'll see

2900.4 --> 2905.14
I mean it might be a bit late

2903.22 --> 2907.4199999999996
who cares

2905.14 --> 2909.819
yeah and if you miss it we'll do it

2907.42 --> 2911.7400000000002
another time maybe it doesn't show up I

2909.819 --> 2914.319
mean he he does have like a family and

2911.74 --> 2916.54
stuff and his daughter is sick with the

2914.319 --> 2920.319
flu right now

2916.54 --> 2921.579
so yeah he's excused either way if he

2920.319 --> 2923.14
doesn't show up

2921.579 --> 2925.44
I had a great talk with him again

2923.14 --> 2925.44
yesterday

2929.68 --> 2934.1189999999997
but he could be showing up anywhere

2931.9 --> 2936.579
between 10 minutes from now and 40

2934.119 --> 2940.8
minutes from now

2936.579 --> 2940.8
let's use this again

2954.22 --> 2957.8799999999997
there's no proof they've given for its

2956.319 --> 2960.7
Landing yet

2957.88 --> 2964.359
right so just like the Israel

2960.7 --> 2967.48
Moon crash landing

2964.359 --> 2971.52
just a bunch of CGI clapping oh so

2967.48 --> 2971.52
special and and that's it

2979.4 --> 2982.59
[Music]

2985.1 --> 2989.94
[Music]

2987.64 --> 2989.94
foreign

3008.7 --> 3014.4199999999996
all right Darth good to see you there

3010.44 --> 3014.42
yeah let me know in Skype

3064.96 --> 3070.02
[Music]

3067.8 --> 3072.2400000000002
why don't they pretend it's successful

3070.02 --> 3077.18
at the time if it's fake because then

3072.24 --> 3077.18
the novelty goes on like wears off

3079.859 --> 3083.359
if it always succeeds

3083.52 --> 3087.98
yeah it is kind of a dumb question Tara

3085.559 --> 3087.98
I agree

3089.48 --> 3092.679
[Music]

3093.0 --> 3099.0
if it just always succeeds then

3095.339 --> 3101.52
literally everybody stops scaring

3099.0 --> 3105.24
right it just becomes like traffic then

3101.52 --> 3107.3
it's like oh wow today we didn't have an

3105.24 --> 3110.439
accident like yeah duh

3107.3 --> 3110.4390000000003
[Music]

3120.02 --> 3123.319
right anyway

3131.7 --> 3136.02
right oh by the way I re-watched Indiana

3134.22 --> 3141.0789999999997
Jones

3136.02 --> 3141.079
dial of Destiny again just the jacket

3141.54 --> 3146.16
and I really stand by what I said I

3144.18 --> 3148.68
really do think it was like a worthy

3146.16 --> 3151.14
Indiana Jones movie

3148.68 --> 3154.5589999999997
and I double checked also Harrison

3151.14 --> 3156.7799999999997
Ford's Prestige like wedding performance

3154.559 --> 3159.119
and

3156.78 --> 3161.94
it's not even that bad

3159.119 --> 3165.1800000000003
like but it is like a thing like he is

3161.94 --> 3169.2200000000003
definitely aging and it's like yeah but

3165.18 --> 3169.22
it still did fine I guess

3170.76 --> 3176.3
enjoyed the film it was fun yeah no it

3172.98 --> 3176.3
is pretty decent and

3177.72 --> 3181.02
like there are a lot of loose ends in

3180.059 --> 3185.1600000000003
there

3181.02 --> 3188.7
but I mean it's an Indiana Jones film

3185.16 --> 3191.8799999999997
and it's just fun it's like it's okay to

3188.7 --> 3193.7999999999997
have loose ends in an Indiana Jones film

3191.88 --> 3195.96
because it's much more about the ride

3193.8 --> 3198.8390000000004
than it is about the logical consistency

3195.96 --> 3201.7200000000003
I mean dude at one point

3198.839 --> 3203.94
he basically escapes from Nazi

3201.72 --> 3206.4599999999996
interrogation because a bomb

3203.94 --> 3207.42
and then it just knocks out some guy in

3206.46 --> 3210.359
a car

3207.42 --> 3212.579
pulls him out takes the seat and then

3210.359 --> 3214.619
people like somebody comes up walking

3212.579 --> 3218.3590000000004
and just like step in like he's the

3214.619 --> 3221.7000000000003
right he literally threw a guy right out

3218.359 --> 3224.64
on the side in front of the car like

3221.7 --> 3226.5
there's no absolutely no reason why

3224.64 --> 3230.16
anybody approaching that wouldn't have

3226.5 --> 3233.52
seen that is completely ridiculous but

3230.16 --> 3235.6189999999997
it's so Indiana Jones you know

3233.52 --> 3238.8
so it's like yeah duh

3235.619 --> 3240.54
oh it's not logically yeah no [ __ ] dude

3238.8 --> 3241.559
it's freaking Indiana Jones what do you

3240.54 --> 3244.5
want

3241.559 --> 3247.6800000000003
it's not about the consistency it's

3244.5 --> 3250.559
about having a an interesting spectacle

3247.68 --> 3253.5
happening a lot

3250.559 --> 3256.26
and like over the top luck and [ __ ]

3253.5 --> 3259.26
that's Indiana Jones I mean those

3256.26 --> 3262.2200000000003
chasing scenes are really good

3259.26 --> 3262.2200000000003
they're great

3262.859 --> 3268.02
I really enjoyed the movie a second time

3266.04 --> 3271.5
so it's like yeah no I stand right I

3268.02 --> 3274.46
think it's a worthy Indiana Jones movie

3271.5 --> 3274.46
I really do

3274.68 --> 3279.96
and yes it's freaking stupid at Parts

3277.02 --> 3282.42
but they all are freaking stupid at

3279.96 --> 3284.599
parts so what do you want that's the

3282.42 --> 3284.599
style

3288.98 --> 3294.18
oh yeah by the way I also noticed that

3291.48 --> 3296.04
Antonio Banderas was in there as the

3294.18 --> 3297.8999999999996
ship captain I didn't even see him the

3296.04 --> 3301.5
first time and then I realized hey

3297.9 --> 3303.1800000000003
that's that's Zoro

3301.5 --> 3305.04
with a big beard

3303.18 --> 3307.74
I thought he was a pretty cool character

3305.04 --> 3309.839
too bad he like immediately got killed

3307.74 --> 3313.02
pretty much

3309.839 --> 3317.359
I was was like yeah I want that guy back

3313.02 --> 3317.359
also the kid was pretty freaking awesome

3320.339 --> 3327.0
so it's like

3322.74 --> 3330.7799999999997
this movie it made me want more again

3327.0 --> 3333.119
it's like yeah interesting characters

3330.78 --> 3335.46
pretty decently interesting villain

3333.119 --> 3337.319
which is really tough doing that an

3335.46 --> 3338.7
interesting villain with Nazis at this

3337.319 --> 3340.8
point it's like

3338.7 --> 3342.1189999999997
a bit overdone but it was still

3340.8 --> 3345.54
interesting

3342.119 --> 3346.319
and it made me want like yeah I could I

3345.54 --> 3349.44
could

3346.319 --> 3351.3
I could could definitely imagine another

3349.44 --> 3353.2200000000003
one of these

3351.3 --> 3357.02
it's like hurry up though before

3353.22 --> 3357.02
Harrison just gets too freaking old

3366.42 --> 3371.76
it's also really typical with Indiana

3369.24 --> 3373.7999999999997
Jones that they always

3371.76 --> 3376.8590000000004
it's so

3373.8 --> 3379.38
grabbler magic because it's like oh it's

3376.859 --> 3382.44
an archaeologist it's like

3379.38 --> 3385.2000000000003
super precious all these artifacts and

3382.44 --> 3387.0
and every time that happens in an

3385.2 --> 3388.3799999999997
Indiana Jones movie where there's some

3387.0 --> 3392.04
archive

3388.38 --> 3394.26
of antique antique stuff and [ __ ]

3392.04 --> 3396.66
and a fight breaks out like it's always

3394.26 --> 3398.4
[ __ ] Indiana Jones who literally

3396.66 --> 3400.7999999999997
trashes it all

3398.4 --> 3402.359
just to get a clean getaway he does it

3400.8 --> 3405.2400000000002
every [ __ ] movie have you ever

3402.359 --> 3409.5589999999997
noticed it he does it in all of them

3405.24 --> 3412.5
always trashes like gigantic amounts of

3409.559 --> 3414.2400000000002
historical artifacts when action breaks

3412.5 --> 3416.46
out he [ __ ] does it every time it's

3414.24 --> 3420.359
crazy

3416.46 --> 3422.339
yeah but I mean again it's the ride but

3420.359 --> 3425.4
it is really like if you're actually

3422.339 --> 3427.5589999999997
like a real archaeologist type

3425.4 --> 3429.42
then watching an Indiana Jones movie

3427.559 --> 3432.119
should be like torture because it's like

3429.42 --> 3435.44
oh my God what did you just do

3432.119 --> 3435.44
no how much damage

3436.68 --> 3440.18
archive you freak

3443.67 --> 3447.42
[Music]

3444.72 --> 3449.64
but yeah that's just part of it what

3447.42 --> 3453.14
they do

3449.64 --> 3453.14
part of the grappler or Magic

3454.74 --> 3459.02
hey skeptic 936 it's you

3461.4 --> 3468.559
going to Nevada desert

3464.94 --> 3468.559
caught riding and drinking oh

3472.98 --> 3476.359
is that it could call me

3476.7 --> 3486.359
going out in the desert with a quad

3481.559 --> 3490.0400000000004
and guns and drinking beer

3486.359 --> 3490.04
are you sure you want to do this

3490.079 --> 3492.559
uh

3494.28 --> 3499.94
it's probably fine

3496.8 --> 3499.94
you're Americans

3520.5 --> 3524.48
right anyway have fun with that skeptic

3525.96 --> 3528.92

3565.799 --> 3569.22

3634.5 --> 3637.099
euros

3638.119 --> 3644.119
I promise

3640.68 --> 3648.66
I will not e-bag

3644.119 --> 3651.1800000000003
beside the standard intro a single time

3648.66 --> 3654.1189999999997
this weekend how about that

3651.18 --> 3655.5589999999997
no e-bagging if I get 50 euros

3654.119 --> 3659.78
together

3655.559 --> 3659.78
before tomorrow morning basically

3662.28 --> 3667.44
okay and I'll do long shows too I mean

3665.4 --> 3669.42
it was depending on the temperature but

3667.44 --> 3671.28
I like I'll do

3669.42 --> 3674.52
like

3671.28 --> 3677.1600000000003
three to four hours and I will not e-bag

3674.52 --> 3679.68
a single time how about that

3677.16 --> 3683.52
anybody thinks that that is like the

3679.68 --> 3686.359
ultimate deal then yeah send me some

3683.52 --> 3686.359
through the PayPal

3694.14 --> 3696.44
what

3719.7 --> 3724.6189999999997
are you

3721.319 --> 3729.14
what are you nagging terrorate about

3724.619 --> 3729.1400000000003
or an alcohol you seem to be nagging him

3741.72 --> 3745.64
hey steamy traveler good to see you

3752.04 --> 3756.839
right yeah there's new there's like work

3755.52 --> 3758.7599999999998
outside of the building here because

3756.839 --> 3760.14
they're installing new glass fiber

3758.76 --> 3762.5400000000004
internet

3760.14 --> 3765.319
cables which is great it's happening all

3762.54 --> 3765.319
over you track

3767.099 --> 3771.6600000000003
so whatever's gonna happen you track is

3770.099 --> 3773.7000000000003
gonna have pretty sweet internet

3771.66 --> 3777.54
connection

3773.7 --> 3781.2599999999998
and that might even yield for

3777.54 --> 3783.0589999999997
for the stream here I really hope so

3781.26 --> 3784.3190000000004
it's like all the internet's going to be

3783.059 --> 3786.44
faster because of that that would be

3784.319 --> 3786.44
great

3808.859 --> 3813.9
wow it's just

3811.559 --> 3816.3590000000004
some no longer longer is hitting the

3813.9 --> 3818.64
wall and like I'm just noticing like hey

3816.359 --> 3821.5789999999997
I don't really need

3818.64 --> 3824.0989999999997
the fan anymore I finally stopped having

3821.579 --> 3827.099
continual sweat breakouts

3824.099 --> 3828.9
because it's more doable in here by the

3827.099 --> 3831.059
way I should really try to get a

3828.9 --> 3834.059
thermometer here

3831.059 --> 3836.3390000000004
so I can actually have it a physical

3834.059 --> 3838.02
temperature reading

3836.339 --> 3839.819
and would be pretty cool for the show

3838.02 --> 3842.94
too

3839.819 --> 3846.859
if I could have an actual

3842.94 --> 3846.859
thermometer that isn't electronic

3858.91 --> 3861.299
[Music]

3860.64 --> 3866.04
um

3861.299 --> 3869.599
right if I ever bump into one at like a

3866.04 --> 3869.599
some antique store or something

3870.18 --> 3876.2
or like secondhand store thing I'll make

3873.299 --> 3876.2
sure to pick one up

3878.94 --> 3883.319
because then I can actually compare the

3881.04 --> 3886.52
temperature in my room to what it is

3883.319 --> 3886.52
said to be

3903.54 --> 3905.72
thank you

3918.42 --> 3923.099
he's all sweating to field yeah it's a

3920.88 --> 3928.28
good point Jared it's

3923.099 --> 3928.28
it's stalling buying time as well

3929.22 --> 3934.5
so prove the fails are delivered

3931.92 --> 3938.099
it's in a plan it's a planning system or

3934.5 --> 3941.339
you know you can't prove

3938.099 --> 3943.799
the intention you can only deduce the

3941.339 --> 3946.5
intention from the whole

3943.799 --> 3949.16
what you're asking for is and like

3946.5 --> 3949.16
unreasonable

3951.599 --> 3956.52
you've seen the plan no I just said

3954.299 --> 3960.38
deduce it

3956.52 --> 3964.04
back engineer what's happening tactics

3960.38 --> 3964.04
reoccurring patterns

3967.98 --> 3972.859
you mean make it up you want to get

3970.38 --> 3972.859
kicked out

3973.14 --> 3975.74
huh

3988.15 --> 3991.51
[Music]

3998.28 --> 4002.3190000000004
so leave okay goodbye

4003.74 --> 4006.9199999999996
yeah

4004.88 --> 4009.1400000000003
and while you're at it maybe you'd like

4006.92 --> 4011.78
to come back with actual

4009.14 --> 4014.48
physical measured proof of your globe

4011.78 --> 4017.0
that you believe in yeah in the meantime

4014.48 --> 4020.539
we'll deduce

4017.0 --> 4022.7
why certain things keep reoccurring like

4020.539 --> 4025.7000000000003
reoccurring patterns

4022.7 --> 4028.64
within the industry

4025.7 --> 4031.46
of space fakery yeah

4028.64 --> 4033.5589999999997
and we'll deduce those patterns yeah and

4031.46 --> 4035.7200000000003
we're not going to prove them because

4033.559 --> 4038.7200000000003
that's unreasonable you can't prove

4035.72 --> 4043.0589999999997
motivations

4038.72 --> 4043.0589999999997
like that you can't actually prove that

4043.339 --> 4050.5589999999997
but you can definitely logically deduce

4046.22 --> 4050.5589999999997
and then if it fits it fits

4051.14 --> 4056.18
right if certain priorities are just

4053.72 --> 4057.14
Unearthed like hey they want to keep

4056.18 --> 4059.359
going

4057.14 --> 4061.819
well how do you keep going well you have

4059.359 --> 4063.74
to keep presenting something but if you

4061.819 --> 4065.24
just keep presenting success all the

4063.74 --> 4067.339
time guess what you're going to run out

4065.24 --> 4069.74
of time

4067.339 --> 4071.66
because there's only so many things you

4069.74 --> 4074.5989999999997
can think of

4071.66 --> 4077.299
to continue your progress with so if you

4074.599 --> 4080.839
go through the progress

4077.299 --> 4083.72
to quickly you'll run out of time the

4080.839 --> 4088.16
entire point of making that giant amount

4083.72 --> 4091.3999999999996
of money is to make it last longer

4088.16 --> 4092.839
so it is pure logic to insert failures

4091.4 --> 4096.259
in there

4092.839 --> 4098.66
just to make it all last longer to have

4096.259 --> 4100.339
something to present and not necessarily

4098.66 --> 4103.4
have to like completely build out

4100.339 --> 4106.16
everything very quickly let's say agree

4103.4 --> 4107.7789999999995
for a success because a fake success is

4106.16 --> 4110.199
much more complicated than a fake

4107.779 --> 4110.1990000000005
failure

4111.58 --> 4118.2789999999995
but the procedures that suggest that it

4116.179 --> 4120.56
would be real do take just as long so

4118.279 --> 4123.859
it's a good way to buy more time just do

4120.56 --> 4125.900000000001
a failure periodically and hey failure

4123.859 --> 4127.819
with people that believe it their

4125.9 --> 4129.799
expectations

4127.819 --> 4133.04
you know

4129.799 --> 4134.66
it makes it more real alike if there's

4133.04 --> 4138.4
failures

4134.66 --> 4138.4
makes it feel more risky

4145.219 --> 4151.2390000000005
why do I love it because I gave it to

4147.98 --> 4151.239
them original D Rose

4152.72 --> 4157.149
[Music]

4158.359 --> 4163.400000000001
same reason why I gave akumu virus a

4161.12 --> 4165.739
wrench

4163.4 --> 4168.259
and if he's a ball [ __ ] he's a voltar

4165.739 --> 4170.66
yeah if he's a ball tired well then

4168.259 --> 4172.88
don't keep poking them you're not gonna

4170.66 --> 4175.88
get them out of the chat do you see

4172.88 --> 4179.66
that's not how this chat works

4175.88 --> 4182.2390000000005
this is not hey let's elbow all the

4179.66 --> 4184.219
Ballers out of here that's not what we

4182.239 --> 4187.459999999999
do in this chat

4184.219 --> 4190.6
yeah I don't want bickering like that

4187.46 --> 4193.88
somebody is acting like a ball tart then

4190.6 --> 4196.52
just realize that and move on don't

4193.88 --> 4197.4800000000005
don't get caught in this pointless back

4196.52 --> 4201.080000000001
and forth

4197.48 --> 4204.11
bickering because they don't listen

4201.08 --> 4207.32
that's what makes them a Baltar

4204.11 --> 4209.0599999999995
[Applause]

4207.32 --> 4210.34
that you're a ball [ __ ] without a wrench

4209.06 --> 4212.719
I know

4210.34 --> 4215.2390000000005
[Music]

4212.719 --> 4217.56
it's not exactly done anything to make

4215.239 --> 4218.49
me want to give you a wrench yet

4217.56 --> 4225.8
[Applause]

4218.49 --> 4225.8
[Music]

4233.36 --> 4238.639999999999
all right and hey

4236.179 --> 4240.7390000000005
we're in Oklahoma he left immediately so

4238.64 --> 4244.52
at least

4240.739 --> 4246.5599999999995
he respects my authority you know

4244.52 --> 4248.860000000001
that's great so he gets to keep the

4246.56 --> 4248.860000000001
wrench

4249.86 --> 4253.699
because when it was getting annoying and

4251.9 --> 4256.219
I said something about it he immediately

4253.699 --> 4257.9
stopped and that's exactly what I'm

4256.219 --> 4263.9800000000005
expecting

4257.9 --> 4263.98
hey skeptic skeptic skeptic what is that

4266.0 --> 4272.38
huh bro

4269.12 --> 4272.38
what who is that

4273.14 --> 4278.3
wow

4274.659 --> 4281.12
who is that though yeah I got your

4278.3 --> 4283.1
PayPal it's got I got another PayPal

4281.12 --> 4286.0
from somebody I don't know

4283.1 --> 4286.0
who is that

4287.26 --> 4291.679
[Music]

4289.04 --> 4293.659
I don't yeah I don't want to like say

4291.679 --> 4296.0
the names of people in the PayPal

4293.659 --> 4298.5199999999995
because they might not want to be known

4296.0 --> 4301.4
like that but thank you whoever you are

4298.52 --> 4304.179
you if you want you can tell me in Skype

4301.4 --> 4304.179
that it was you

4304.82 --> 4312.219
but dude I'm set for the weekend I got

4307.82 --> 4312.219
my 50 euros this is amazing

4312.26 --> 4316.84
ah

4313.64 --> 4316.84
was it you dear Rose

4318.02 --> 4322.719
or

4319.88 --> 4322.719
what was that

4322.76 --> 4327.8
but yeah I'm great thank you so much

4324.98 --> 4330.259999999999
guys this is fantastic

4327.8 --> 4332.0
oh man I'm cooking still though it's

4330.26 --> 4335.0
probably the exit a sudden excitement

4332.0 --> 4335.0
yes

4336.86 --> 4341.599999999999
I'm so glad that I'm gonna have Gusto

4339.5 --> 4344.179
energy drinks this weekend

4341.6 --> 4346.76
with the heat wave

4344.179 --> 4350.3
awesome thank you guys so much

4346.76 --> 4351.92
you are amazing

4350.3 --> 4353.78
but I still kind of want to know who

4351.92 --> 4355.6990000000005
that was

4353.78 --> 4357.259999999999
but maybe they don't want to Shell but

4355.699 --> 4358.94
they want to don't want to tell but

4357.26 --> 4361.900000000001
thank you whoever you are I really

4358.94 --> 4361.9
appreciate that

4370.88 --> 4376.82
the one thing about excitement is is

4373.4 --> 4378.5599999999995
that it tends to make you hot

4376.82 --> 4380.78
but it's really hot so I'm like

4378.56 --> 4383.360000000001
immediately breaking out in sweat this

4380.78 --> 4385.28
is like because it's hot and I had just

4383.36 --> 4388.96
cooled off to the point where I wouldn't

4385.28 --> 4388.96
be in continual sweat anymore

4389.0 --> 4396.28
ah but anyway thank you guys so much

4392.239 --> 4396.28
this is great uh

4397.46 --> 4402.9800000000005
where is Darth maybe still preoccupied

4399.92 --> 4404.179
I'm still ready energy drinks raise your

4402.98 --> 4408.639999999999
body temperature

4404.179 --> 4408.64
that depends on the energy drink

4408.82 --> 4415.88
Gusto I don't think it does it's an

4412.52 --> 4418.659000000001
extraordinarily refreshing drink

4415.88 --> 4418.659000000001
foreign

4420.82 --> 4424.179
whatever it is

4425.3 --> 4432.7390000000005
it does have some caffeine though

4429.44 --> 4435.94
but I mean it doesn't really raise the

4432.739 --> 4435.94
temperature for me

4436.58 --> 4442.0599999999995
it does wake me up a lot

4439.94 --> 4442.0599999999995
um

4447.62 --> 4454.599999999999
you might be busy

4450.62 --> 4454.599999999999
never heard of it

4456.38 --> 4462.64
well I've been showing that for quite a

4459.199 --> 4462.639999999999
while it's an organic drink

4465.38 --> 4470.08
so yeah I love this stuff

4471.08 --> 4475.239
it's like a really a summer drink

4480.739 --> 4485.419999999999
and it's vegan and organic

4487.6 --> 4494.08
no not David Wise

4490.52 --> 4494.080000000001
D Rose Darth

4497.239 --> 4500.54
Darth might be a bit for before your

4499.46 --> 4503.96
time

4500.54 --> 4507.62
but he's the guy that made like the

4503.96 --> 4511.1
Globe Earth dictate videos like

4507.62 --> 4513.83
great parody

4511.1 --> 4518.13
of Flat Earth debates great stuff

4513.83 --> 4518.13
[Music]

4526.159 --> 4530.839999999999
what is the flavor

4528.679 --> 4535.3
um what is it

4530.84 --> 4538.82
it's sort of like Cola but not so

4535.3 --> 4542.78
aggressive it's like sort of an herbal

4538.82 --> 4545.32
Cola taste but not super Cola not super

4542.78 --> 4545.32
sugary

4545.48 --> 4550.04
I don't know it yeah it's like an herbed

4547.76 --> 4551.900000000001
Cola it's a really nice taste they have

4550.04 --> 4555.199
other variants too where it's like a

4551.9 --> 4557.679
more lemon oriented taste but I like

4555.199 --> 4557.678999999999
this one

4565.34 --> 4572.179
yeah and the uh carbonation is not super

4568.64 --> 4574.1
aggressive so yeah you open it up it

4572.179 --> 4575.78
will get stale like within two hours

4574.1 --> 4579.320000000001
completely

4575.78 --> 4581.719
Cola usually lasts a bit longer but that

4579.32 --> 4584.259999999999
see the CO2 in that is also much more

4581.719 --> 4584.26
aggressive

4600.04 --> 4607.04
since as far back as much yeah I know

4603.739 --> 4610.218999999999
there are you've been like a a recent G

4607.04 --> 4613.82
Plus fan list like in this year I know I

4610.219 --> 4616.28
keep track of what everybody's doing

4613.82 --> 4617.9
but I you are a very welcome addition to

4616.28 --> 4619.639999999999
Flat Earth debates I really do like

4617.9 --> 4621.86
talking with you

4619.64 --> 4627.04
I was thinking like

4621.86 --> 4627.04
maybe one time you me and Darth

4627.98 --> 4633.98
could like have a just a a blabber

4631.88 --> 4636.4400000000005
session

4633.98 --> 4639.678999999999
with me and Darth alone were already

4636.44 --> 4642.44
like go on for hours potentially but I

4639.679 --> 4645.02
mean that would be pretty funky like us

4642.44 --> 4647.178999999999
three and just talk about stuff and

4645.02 --> 4650.8
esoteric stuff and religious stuff and

4647.179 --> 4650.8
magical stuff and everything

4654.56 --> 4658.1
right so I'm keeping that in the back of

4656.48 --> 4660.259999999999
my mind

4658.1 --> 4663.88
and to be fair I really hope to like

4660.26 --> 4663.88
that darth's gonna kind of keep around

4664.82 --> 4668.259999999999
he's a really cool guy

4671.54 --> 4676.64
and it's funny because he has the weird

4673.46 --> 4678.9800000000005
awkwardness thing to him that I

4676.64 --> 4682.159000000001
recognize I used to have that too and

4678.98 --> 4684.919999999999
then I exchanged that for like no I'm

4682.159 --> 4687.44
gonna be Alpha instead instead of

4684.92 --> 4689.71
awkward I'm gonna be [ __ ] Alpha

4687.44 --> 4692.929999999999
mercilessly

4689.71 --> 4692.93
[Music]

4693.08 --> 4698.08
two as far as I can of course of

4695.12 --> 4698.08
somebody of my size

4705.32 --> 4709.759999999999
but that took some time by the way I

4707.36 --> 4712.04
definitely did not start out when you

4709.76 --> 4715.62
look back at like the old sweaters talks

4712.04 --> 4717.56
I'm quite awkward and insecure

4715.62 --> 4721.699
[Music]

4717.56 --> 4723.860000000001
a lot of like nervous laughs and [ __ ] I

4721.699 --> 4725.719
am not like that anymore like during the

4723.86 --> 4728.299999999999
Flat Earth early bird I just was like

4725.719 --> 4730.34
okay I'm done with with like being

4728.3 --> 4733.6
apologetic and [ __ ] I'm like I'm not

4730.34 --> 4733.6
doing it anymore I'm just gonna

4734.34 --> 4738.5
[Music]

4736.58 --> 4742.42
turn it inside out

4738.5 --> 4742.42
no what um

4746.32 --> 4751.54
like priority of teacher

4754.36 --> 4761.0599999999995
sorry I just

4757.34 --> 4762.92
I oh they keep thinking of that

4761.06 --> 4765.1990000000005
it's just so funny when somebody

4762.92 --> 4767.84
actually says they're an alpha it just

4765.199 --> 4770.799999999999
immediately reminds me of that including

4767.84 --> 4770.8
when I say it

4774.5 --> 4777.92
some of you might not know what the hell

4776.12 --> 4779.9
I was just doing but that's based on

4777.92 --> 4783.02
this weird video that Owen Benjamin

4779.9 --> 4786.82
pulled off the internet one time awesome

4783.02 --> 4786.820000000001
clearly handicapped person

4787.04 --> 4793.46
that that's like sort of [ __ ] that

4790.34 --> 4795.32
goes to the teachings like oh or no he

4793.46 --> 4797.0
like tries to dominate the teacher but I

4795.32 --> 4800.62
mean he has a speech impediment and it's

4797.0 --> 4803.239
just so so silly and hilarious

4800.62 --> 4805.159
and cute that he actually thinks he's

4803.239 --> 4806.32
dominating it's really cute in that

4805.159 --> 4809.92
sense

4806.32 --> 4809.92
oh Darth yeah

4818.06 --> 4822.26
oh she made a full recovery overnight

4819.92 --> 4824.42
that's awesome

4822.26 --> 4827.360000000001
whenever you're ready

4824.42 --> 4829.719
all right you guys are ready for Darth

4827.36 --> 4829.719
to get on

4830.239 --> 4833.839999999999
right it might get a bit messy at first

4832.34 --> 4836.3
I have to like

4833.84 --> 4839.4800000000005
see how I can put it in the view and

4836.3 --> 4841.52
[ __ ] might end up looking so clunky that

4839.48 --> 4845.44
I'm not gonna have

4841.52 --> 4845.4400000000005
the Skype actually on screen

4846.94 --> 4850.178999999999
hold on

4855.14 --> 4860.5
that's yeah I'll be right back in a

4858.38 --> 4860.5

oh you're good

5185.44 --> 5190.0
it's just fine

5187.42 --> 5193.12
the only issue with the video is I tend

5190.0 --> 5195.04
to pace around as I'm talking so I I

5193.12 --> 5196.9
almost need to just plant myself down

5195.04 --> 5199.239
here and stop myself from doing that

5196.9 --> 5202.179
right now that's fine I'll just do it

5199.239 --> 5203.58
like this voila we're right next to one

5202.179 --> 5206.139
another

5203.58 --> 5208.48
great all right yeah great to have you

5206.139 --> 5210.1
on man awesome

5208.48 --> 5212.5599999999995
be here thank you for for having me

5210.1 --> 5214.54
let's see if I can get this little video

5212.56 --> 5216.88
out of

5214.54 --> 5219.1
this little corner thing

5216.88 --> 5220.42
can you get that out do you know how to

5219.1 --> 5225.659000000001
do that

5220.42 --> 5225.659
I don't know just about anything so

5225.94 --> 5230.5
hmm

5228.159 --> 5232.179
okay well you're gonna have to have that

5230.5 --> 5234.52
little thing in the corner unfortunately

5232.179 --> 5235.659
this will improvised anyway as long as

5234.52 --> 5236.92
it's working

5235.659 --> 5238.299999999999
yeah I don't even see what you're

5236.92 --> 5239.8
talking about I don't have the stream up

5238.3 --> 5241.659000000001
because I don't want to monopolize my

5239.8 --> 5243.6990000000005
internet so

5241.659 --> 5249.28
all right that's fair enough

5243.699 --> 5251.32
uh watch it back someday right so yeah

5249.28 --> 5254.08
welcome on the show

5251.32 --> 5258.099999999999
yeah be here your first live stream

5254.08 --> 5261.46
yes well I have up here on the debate as

5258.1 --> 5263.139
my Alter Ego on a few occasions but as

5261.46 --> 5266.62
you know it's a little bit hard to get

5263.139 --> 5270.4800000000005
words in there at times I basically do

5266.62 --> 5270.48
some Neil ass Grunts and uh

5275.02 --> 5279.34
you still is is that actually a cat by

5277.6 --> 5281.34
the way or was that just the sound

5279.34 --> 5284.8
effect of a cat

5281.34 --> 5285.639
I had I had a cat that was just a sound

5284.8 --> 5288.3
effect

5285.639 --> 5288.3
by cat literally

5289.6 --> 5294.820000000001
literally oh wow we actually died wow

5291.82 --> 5297.96
that's that's a sad piece of uh

5294.82 --> 5301.12
background data that I didn't know yeah

5297.96 --> 5303.159
its name wasn't snazz a friend I don't

5301.12 --> 5306.58
even remember the name now it's a it's a

5303.159 --> 5309.159
friend yeah right that's a friends yeah

5306.58 --> 5311.739
her Nick was out Mira she was a trash

5309.159 --> 5314.0199999999995
can Kitty I I found her somebody was

5311.739 --> 5316.36
giving her away inside of a trash can

5314.02 --> 5318.639
and I was with my ex at the time and

5316.36 --> 5321.099999999999
she's like oh no and I'm like I don't

5318.639 --> 5322.900000000001
want another cat but she ended up being

5321.1 --> 5324.280000000001
a good cat aside from the fact that she

5322.9 --> 5325.719
was declawed so she could never really

5324.28 --> 5327.5199999999995
go

5325.719 --> 5330.88
because I felt that was a little bit

5327.52 --> 5332.26
like and she was kind of stupid too so I

5330.88 --> 5334.0
I don't think she would have been a

5332.26 --> 5334.96
giant meatball for for something out

5334.0 --> 5336.88
there

5334.96 --> 5338.8
so she she stayed in

5336.88 --> 5340.719
and she just passed right shortly before

5338.8 --> 5343.54
that I mean who knows maybe the

5340.719 --> 5346.2390000000005
incredible that it even survived

5343.54 --> 5347.94
oh but yeah you're having a bit choppy

5346.239 --> 5351.4
issues again I'm right

5347.94 --> 5352.48
but it's like pretty romantic

5351.4 --> 5354.638999999999
hello

5352.48 --> 5356.138999999999
I might need to kill the video

5354.639 --> 5357.76
right

5356.139 --> 5359.92
let's kill the system for a minute then

5357.76 --> 5362.7390000000005
I guess I I don't know all right it's

5359.92 --> 5364.3
back to normal that did the trick but at

5362.739 --> 5367.0599999999995
least everybody got to see you you we

5364.3 --> 5369.28
can try to turn it back on but

5367.06 --> 5372.34
proof that I'm a human being yes

5369.28 --> 5375.34
although well anybody that's watched the

5372.34 --> 5379.360000000001
video has seen me as Ethan Whitley

5375.34 --> 5380.679
but I've shaved since then so right for

5379.36 --> 5384.179
facial hair right now

5380.679 --> 5386.62
yeah tend to agree

5384.179 --> 5389.5
it's all sticky

5386.62 --> 5391.659
right but I also because I shave and it

5389.5 --> 5395.26
reduces about 20 years off my appearance

5391.659 --> 5398.32
so I think I could go and do the what's

5395.26 --> 5399.34
that 22 Jump Street and go into a high

5398.32 --> 5401.98
school and

5399.34 --> 5405.400000000001
well we won't go there that that might

5401.98 --> 5407.86
be suspicious so all right but how old

5405.4 --> 5410.379999999999
are you actually if I may ask

5407.86 --> 5411.699
about pardon what what is your age

5410.38 --> 5414.76
actually

5411.699 --> 5417.099999999999
I'm 39. 39

5414.76 --> 5419.7390000000005
wow I thought you were a lot younger

5417.1 --> 5422.4400000000005
than that really no

5419.739 --> 5423.759999999999
yeah I thought you were like 23 or

5422.44 --> 5425.678999999999
something

5423.76 --> 5428.02
no well thank you that's that's that's

5425.679 --> 5430.84
Charming although you do have kids and

5428.02 --> 5433.179
all that so that right would have had

5430.84 --> 5435.1
the kids very young but I mean it's it

5433.179 --> 5437.92
still look very young so

5435.1 --> 5440.02
well done I could pass for that maybe

5437.92 --> 5444.82
with my daughter she's only six but my

5440.02 --> 5446.320000000001
son's 14. so oh wow stretch yeah

5444.82 --> 5448.54
right

5446.32 --> 5450.04
oh that's pretty good age starting at

5448.54 --> 5453.219
25.

5450.04 --> 5455.0199999999995
right well I figured too once I turned

5453.219 --> 5457.9
30 that I'm gonna just subtract the

5455.02 --> 5461.5
years from there so actually I guess I'd

5457.9 --> 5465.46
be like around 22 by now so

5461.5 --> 5467.62
I I'm very vain in that regard I uh I I

5465.46 --> 5469.42
might have a slight mental crisis when I

5467.62 --> 5470.98
turn 40 but

5469.42 --> 5472.96
yeah

5470.98 --> 5476.62
not that you're 40. of course you're

5472.96 --> 5478.719
only about 29 I'd say Neo thank you I'm

5476.62 --> 5481.12
actually 43.

5478.719 --> 5483.58
right that's that is that is shocking

5481.12 --> 5485.679
yes

5483.58 --> 5487.96
well I'm basically the only thing I

5485.679 --> 5490.1990000000005
really count my age with is like where

5487.96 --> 5495.28
my hairline is and it's getting weird

5490.199 --> 5497.5
but uh I mean it I still have it

5495.28 --> 5499.54
like my hairline is technically better

5497.5 --> 5501.699
than my dad's

5499.54 --> 5503.38
so I'm just like May hopefully the next

5501.699 --> 5505.0
generation will have like the ultimate

5503.38 --> 5507.3
perfect hairline that never goes away

5505.0 --> 5507.3
ever

5507.46 --> 5511.62
if I'm gonna have a Next Generation that

5509.44 --> 5511.62
is

5512.08 --> 5517.659
they say the hairlines your your

5514.199 --> 5519.699
maternal father is often a big influence

5517.659 --> 5522.04
on that and that does seem to be the

5519.699 --> 5524.5599999999995
case in my situation my grandfather like

5522.04 --> 5526.0
he didn't even have a leg or lungs by

5524.56 --> 5528.52
the time he died but he still had a full

5526.0 --> 5531.58
head of hair so nice

5528.52 --> 5535.6
so I hope to follow the exact same path

5531.58 --> 5538.0
yeah vanity right vanity over survival I

5535.6 --> 5540.1
get it exactly especially when you're

5538.0 --> 5543.76
still young it's very appealing

5540.1 --> 5546.719
right it's vanity over survival yeah

5543.76 --> 5546.719
anyway

5547.739 --> 5553.299999999999
sorry say again

5551.08 --> 5555.159
no I would just I I was interrupting the

5553.3 --> 5557.5
flow and you were about ready to segue

5555.159 --> 5559.0
so please yeah I'm trying to say well I

5557.5 --> 5560.86
was like we're talking about little

5559.0 --> 5563.44
small talk thing like I really kind of

5560.86 --> 5565.0599999999995
want to dig into more subject matters

5563.44 --> 5566.739
and all that but I

5565.06 --> 5570.46
we might have like gone through

5566.739 --> 5572.739
everything already right yeah because

5570.46 --> 5575.08
once we hit off it's like very hard

5572.739 --> 5577.0
we're like yeah oh we could talk about

5575.08 --> 5578.679
this and that and that and then we just

5577.0 --> 5581.26
end up talking about it for two hours

5578.679 --> 5583.0
straight and I'm realizing like wait

5581.26 --> 5584.9800000000005
maybe we should actually save this for

5583.0 --> 5586.84
the show

5584.98 --> 5589.36
it's why on like the movie review

5586.84 --> 5591.52
channels that if it's two people doing

5589.36 --> 5593.139
it they always say if they see the movie

5591.52 --> 5596.620000000001
We're not gonna say a word about it

5593.139 --> 5599.4400000000005
until we're on camera so yeah we've kind

5596.62 --> 5601.239
of we we may have ruined it already but

5599.44 --> 5603.94
I I have a feeling that that we have

5601.239 --> 5605.739
plenty of things to to talk about

5603.94 --> 5607.419999999999
um actually I wanted to make a

5605.739 --> 5608.5
correction from something that I said to

5607.42 --> 5612.3
you yesterday

5608.5 --> 5615.46
um I don't know if this is a

5612.3 --> 5617.7390000000005
great topic but the concave Earth

5615.46 --> 5619.659
um I mentioned something mines in France

5617.739 --> 5621.28
and I don't know why I got France into

5619.659 --> 5624.219
my head the mines were actually in

5621.28 --> 5627.159
Michigan that they did the quote-unquote

5624.219 --> 5630.639
experiment on and it's called the

5627.159 --> 5633.94
Tamarack mines and essentially what they

5630.639 --> 5636.159000000001
did as it's reading an article here in a

5633.94 --> 5640.419999999999
nutshell the quote -unquote experiments

5636.159 --> 5642.159
were uh measure uh JB Watson chief

5640.42 --> 5645.9400000000005
engineer of the Tamarack copper mine

5642.159 --> 5648.28
suspended a 4250 foot long fun lines

5645.94 --> 5650.138999999999
down mine shafts measurements show that

5648.28 --> 5652.12
The Plum lines were further apart at the

5650.139 --> 5656.4400000000005
bottom than at the top contrary to

5652.12 --> 5660.4
expectations and that eager as that is

5656.44 --> 5664.178999999999
is the Bitcoin concave versus belief

5660.4 --> 5668.28
okay so what if they just didn't really

5664.179 --> 5668.28
build the mine shaft all that straight

5669.159 --> 5673.42
then then the Earth is still

5671.02 --> 5676.06
remember everything proves your your

5673.42 --> 5678.46
premise right

5676.06 --> 5680.320000000001
well I'm pretty sure that you can

5678.46 --> 5682.2390000000005
explain how it's concave using

5680.32 --> 5684.46
terrestrial refraction

5682.239 --> 5688.0199999999995
right it's just bending the other way

5684.46 --> 5688.02
that's all right

5688.3 --> 5692.8
right I was reading uh they use it

5690.34 --> 5694.78
sometimes now I've heard it they

5692.8 --> 5696.900000000001
actually say like yeah but refractions

5694.78 --> 5699.94
like what really

5696.9 --> 5702.36
you're using terrestrial refraction that

5699.94 --> 5702.36
is so

5702.719 --> 5708.699
big mix of globe claims and Flat Earth

5706.06 --> 5711.820000000001
claims that go into their like kind of

5708.699 --> 5714.4
cosmology I was reading a little PDF and

5711.82 --> 5717.46
it's like 47 pages long and literally

5714.4 --> 5719.5
the first 38 or 8 or 39 pages are all

5717.46 --> 5721.9
the Flat Earth argument and then they

5719.5 --> 5723.88
just tape that and turn it on its head

5721.9 --> 5726.58
essentially

5723.88 --> 5728.56
um to try to map it out I I guess they

5726.58 --> 5730.239
kind of go into the motion of the Stars

5728.56 --> 5733.84
a little bit too but again that's just

5730.239 --> 5736.839999999999
an inversion of the celestial sphere at

5733.84 --> 5739.2390000000005
that point so right because they

5736.84 --> 5741.1
effectively just like they turn

5739.239 --> 5742.239
everything inside out

5741.1 --> 5745.360000000001
right

5742.239 --> 5747.4
like like a relay literal flip it's just

5745.36 --> 5749.08
like whoop no it's exactly everything is

5747.4 --> 5751.0599999999995
inside out so there's no celestial

5749.08 --> 5752.679
sphere that surrounds us it's actually

5751.06 --> 5755.02
on the inside

5752.679 --> 5757.12
so that everything is reversed like

5755.02 --> 5760.780000000001
whatever it might have seen like a ball

5757.12 --> 5764.139
like that's because it's all inside out

5760.78 --> 5766.719
this is really mind warping too think

5764.139 --> 5768.46
like that it's almost like oh I the

5766.719 --> 5770.199
world is exactly the opposite of what

5768.46 --> 5773.199
I've been taught and then like by

5770.199 --> 5775.299999999999
accident like going to fanatic on and

5773.199 --> 5777.699
then being like oh so it's an inside out

5775.3 --> 5781.42
globe and everything is exactly the

5777.699 --> 5785.0199999999995
opposite like what makes people go there

5781.42 --> 5786.82
uh non-conformism mostly I think I mean

5785.02 --> 5788.4400000000005
because again they are they are

5786.82 --> 5791.739
essentially like you said making the

5788.44 --> 5794.08
globe claim in Reverse right but but I

5791.739 --> 5797.678999999999
mean from a non-conform sorry from a

5794.08 --> 5801.04
non-conformist perspective though that's

5797.679 --> 5803.02
very conformist right if you are a

5801.04 --> 5804.1
perfect non-conformist then you are a

5803.02 --> 5806.38
conformist

5804.1 --> 5808.179
and that's like real non-conformists

5806.38 --> 5810.1
know that you can't be perfectly

5808.179 --> 5812.139
non-conformist because then you are a

5810.1 --> 5815.58
conformist yes

5812.139 --> 5817.84
that's hilarious I I use this

5815.58 --> 5819.699
well they even know that in South Park

5817.84 --> 5822.58
remember like the goth kids like wow

5819.699 --> 5825.78
everybody's not in on this so that means

5822.58 --> 5829.9
that I am in on this right wow

5825.78 --> 5832.36
this is specifically in there I I think

5829.9 --> 5835.0
people really like to use some of NASA's

5832.36 --> 5837.219
figures for whatever reason black with

5835.0 --> 5839.26
the like the Thunderbolts people you see

5837.219 --> 5840.76
it with the concave earthers too that

5839.26 --> 5844.3
that they want to have some kind of

5840.76 --> 5845.92
tangible data to point to and then they

5844.3 --> 5849.28
just kind of work backwards from there

5845.92 --> 5851.86
but with the contract I find it really

5849.28 --> 5853.599999999999
hilarious because at least with a glober

5851.86 --> 5855.4
I can kind of understand you have

5853.6 --> 5858.1
consensus working for you and like

5855.4 --> 5861.46
that's very powerful but well and just a

5858.1 --> 5863.92
massive body of work to convince you

5861.46 --> 5865.84
and it makes it very easy to just like

5863.92 --> 5867.639
wow everything is plastic with this it

5865.84 --> 5870.400000000001
should be for a reason right why would

5867.639 --> 5872.9800000000005
they plaster it everywhere if it was

5870.4 --> 5875.379999999999
wrong that would make everybody seem

5872.98 --> 5877.12
stupid so you're just like it just

5875.38 --> 5879.34
it's impossible

5877.12 --> 5880.96
right they they right exactly they want

5879.34 --> 5883.719
to believe that it has some kind of

5880.96 --> 5885.659
connection to reality in some way that

5883.719 --> 5887.7390000000005
all these numbers wouldn't be created

5885.659 --> 5891.04
wholesale that they aren't wholesale

5887.739 --> 5892.9
fiction but I mean I I don't I don't

5891.04 --> 5894.94
know where I stand on that sometimes and

5892.9 --> 5896.98
it depends as always on what numbers

5894.94 --> 5898.719
we're talking about

5896.98 --> 5900.699
um

5898.719 --> 5903.4
what numbers what

5900.699 --> 5904.719
well what specific figures I mean when

5903.4 --> 5906.94
you're talking about like things that

5904.719 --> 5910.44
you're measuring quote unquote in outer

5906.94 --> 5914.44
space like the radii of planets or or

5910.44 --> 5917.799999999999
even even some Optical things along the

5914.44 --> 5920.32
spectrosque I mean spectroscopy line I

5917.8 --> 5921.88
can ever talk Stellar Stellar

5920.32 --> 5923.699
spectroscopy

5921.88 --> 5926.8
language

5923.699 --> 5929.62
yeah yeah which is complete nonsense by

5926.8 --> 5931.0
the way it's right literally divining

5929.62 --> 5933.219
light

5931.0 --> 5936.04
when that process is normally

5933.219 --> 5937.54
specifically reserved for divining

5936.04 --> 5940.179
matter

5937.54 --> 5942.159
like within a perfect vacuum isolated

5940.179 --> 5945.28
and then you expect to do the same

5942.159 --> 5948.699
process looking at something out there

5945.28 --> 5951.34
it's ridiculous

5948.699 --> 5954.5199999999995
yeah all of that kind of fits I I went

5951.34 --> 5957.04
to a science museum last year and they

5954.52 --> 5959.56
were doing a little demonstration on how

5957.04 --> 5962.44
they know what the composition of the

5959.56 --> 5964.06
various celestial objects are and you

5962.44 --> 5965.62
know it's obviously just based on on

5964.06 --> 5967.780000000001
frequency and what and they're just

5965.62 --> 5970.42
comparing it to terrestrial things and

5967.78 --> 5973.12
they never consider for a second that

5970.42 --> 5975.46
you know two things could appear to be

5973.12 --> 5978.04
the same thing and aren't I mean you

5975.46 --> 5980.9800000000005
really never know until you can reach

5978.04 --> 5983.199
out and touch it in a lot of cases

5980.98 --> 5986.44
right and there's other complications

5983.199 --> 5988.299999999999
too I mean it's supposedly a planet it's

5986.44 --> 5991.12
very big that means there could be all

5988.3 --> 5994.659000000001
kinds of things on there well

5991.12 --> 5997.96
light the further the distance goes the

5994.659 --> 6002.04
more it all just Blends into one thing

5997.96 --> 6004.7390000000005
and right you don't even like even

6002.04 --> 6008.36
theoretically you wouldn't have like a

6004.739 --> 6011.159
good logical reading to be able to use

6008.36 --> 6013.199
spectroscopy even if it would work at a

6011.159 --> 6015.36
distance because you're just getting the

6013.199 --> 6017.5199999999995
weird Blended stuff together it's like

6015.36 --> 6020.04
how do you like it's Blended

6017.52 --> 6021.900000000001
like it's not gonna isolate itself to

6020.04 --> 6023.639
get to you the specific material it's

6021.9 --> 6026.4
just Blended light

6023.639 --> 6028.32
how the hell could you define a specific

6026.4 --> 6029.82
material for from a bunch of Blended

6028.32 --> 6032.28
light I don't get it

6029.82 --> 6034.259999999999
well I mean it's right on the one hand

6032.28 --> 6035.88
it's kind of self-defeating when you

6034.26 --> 6038.6990000000005
think about the distances that are

6035.88 --> 6040.8
allegedly involved that's ridiculous but

6038.699 --> 6043.199
I guess that's sort of why you need this

6040.8 --> 6046.4400000000005
all to take place in a quote-unquote

6043.199 --> 6047.879999999999
vacuum of space uh so you're trying to

6046.44 --> 6050.5199999999995
argue that there's nothing in between

6047.88 --> 6053.88
you and the and the star that's

6050.52 --> 6056.639
literally billions and billions of miles

6053.88 --> 6060.4800000000005
away it's it's kind of yeah but there is

6056.639 --> 6062.400000000001
in between right now there's the air

6060.48 --> 6063.78
sure well I mean that's again where

6062.4 --> 6065.5199999999995
they'd argue that they're taking these

6063.78 --> 6068.099999999999
readings from satellites out in space

6065.52 --> 6071.040000000001
sometimes you know so sometimes

6068.1 --> 6074.280000000001
observational telescopes out there

6071.04 --> 6076.32
right but but right only sometimes too

6074.28 --> 6078.36
because even by admission some of them

6076.32 --> 6080.099999999999
are uh well I mean they all are

6078.36 --> 6081.659
ground-based for the most part except

6080.1 --> 6084.6
for the ones that are probably flying

6081.659 --> 6087.0599999999995
around in planes and right I thought

6084.6 --> 6089.1
that original Stellar spectroscopy was

6087.06 --> 6091.38
all ground-based measurements like in

6089.1 --> 6093.42
the Renaissance and [ __ ] okay the

6091.38 --> 6095.159000000001
industrial era it's like no that they

6093.42 --> 6097.139
made all they'd established what

6095.159 --> 6101.099999999999
everything was supposedly through it

6097.139 --> 6104.34
before there were satellites or Rockets

6101.1 --> 6106.8
so whatever oh we measured it after oh

6104.34 --> 6108.900000000001
like you're probably just gonna suddenly

6106.8 --> 6111.06
have the footage of how the ISS was

6108.9 --> 6111.839999999999
assembled 50 years later I'm sure you

6111.06 --> 6114.42
will

6111.84 --> 6116.34
yeah I'm looking forward yeah me too

6114.42 --> 6119.219
like when are you finally gonna round

6116.34 --> 6121.26
out that CGI I mean

6119.219 --> 6123.36
everybody's been waiting for it for

6121.26 --> 6126.900000000001
lifetimes

6123.36 --> 6129.48
where's the assembly video that made

6126.9 --> 6131.099999999999
I I don't know I I don't it happened in

6129.48 --> 6133.259999999999
the 90s

6131.1 --> 6134.76
personally I mean I go back and forth on

6133.26 --> 6137.1
whether they'll even ever do something

6134.76 --> 6139.1990000000005
like that I really don't think that

6137.1 --> 6143.280000000001
there will be another manned mission

6139.199 --> 6146.699
into deeper's quote unquote space at any

6143.28 --> 6148.199
point I mean I just don't think I I kind

6146.699 --> 6152.28
of do prescribe and I think it might

6148.199 --> 6154.86
have been even uh my namesake d-i-t-rh

6152.28 --> 6156.719
that suggested that or maybe it was even

6154.86 --> 6158.339999999999
Jaron that suggested that someday

6156.719 --> 6161.159
they'll probably be some huge

6158.34 --> 6163.02
catastrophe in the space that renders it

6161.159 --> 6165.679
impossible for human beings to go out

6163.02 --> 6165.679
there anymore

6166.1 --> 6170.58
very easily done

6168.36 --> 6173.219
all you say is that there's just a giant

6170.58 --> 6175.86
satellite crashing and now it's all gone

6173.219 --> 6178.34
right the perfect excuse to just turn

6175.86 --> 6181.0199999999995
the internet off everywhere

6178.34 --> 6183.4800000000005
there was a and not turning it back on

6181.02 --> 6185.1
you see because it's it's we can't turn

6183.48 --> 6187.44
it back on yeah but it's all through

6185.1 --> 6188.52
cables yes but the satellites have all

6187.44 --> 6191.04
crashed

6188.52 --> 6194.639
so we can turn it back on yeah you can

6191.04 --> 6197.219
you just put the on switch on no we

6194.639 --> 6200.2390000000005
can't because the satellites are gone we

6197.219 --> 6203.78
can't push that switch no I'm not crazy

6200.239 --> 6206.04
get away from me

6203.78 --> 6208.08
groundwork's been laid for that too with

6206.04 --> 6209.94
just the amount of space debris that

6208.08 --> 6212.82
they're supposed to be out there as well

6209.94 --> 6214.5599999999995
like that and I see an article still

6212.82 --> 6216.179
every few months that pops up talking

6214.56 --> 6219.780000000001
about we have a serious problem with

6216.179 --> 6221.34
space junk so I think and what's funny

6219.78 --> 6225.0599999999995
too there was a show on the Sci-Fi

6221.34 --> 6226.679
channel about 10 years ago I think ah

6225.06 --> 6229.1990000000005
gosh I can't remember the name of it now

6226.679 --> 6231.0
but it involved aliens coming to Earth

6229.199 --> 6233.4
and the Earth gets completely destroyed

6231.0 --> 6236.58
in terraforms but like orbit is also

6233.4 --> 6238.138999999999
ruined so nobody can leave it uh took

6236.58 --> 6240.0599999999995
place in like the only thing that

6238.139 --> 6243.02
remained was like the St Louis Arch are

6240.06 --> 6247.139
you talking about Invader Zim

6243.02 --> 6249.3
I wish I was talking about your Zim

6247.139 --> 6252.2390000000005
I thought you would like that series

6249.3 --> 6253.8
yeah it's good good stuff I haven't

6252.239 --> 6255.119
watched that since I was

6253.8 --> 6258.3
quite a while

6255.119 --> 6259.86
but uh I got to know it in like uh the

6258.3 --> 6262.139
2011.

6259.86 --> 6263.58
because of a friend of mine that was

6262.139 --> 6265.08
kind of flatter at the time I

6263.58 --> 6268.139
experienced all kinds of bizarre things

6265.08 --> 6270.0599999999995
like having Eric Dubai's book in my

6268.139 --> 6271.619
hands before it actually was published

6270.06 --> 6273.360000000001
and [ __ ]

6271.619 --> 6275.639
well that's

6273.36 --> 6277.5599999999995
that's interesting yeah I still don't

6275.639 --> 6279.0
know how the hell it's possible he tried

6277.56 --> 6280.860000000001
to explain it to me he said like no

6279.0 --> 6282.96
there is this publisher

6280.86 --> 6284.88
where you can literally order books

6282.96 --> 6290.42
before they've been written

6284.88 --> 6290.42
and it's like I I don't know what to say

6290.46 --> 6296.34
what time traveling publisher that's

6294.239 --> 6299.218999999999
that's fantastic that that's that's good

6296.34 --> 6301.1990000000005
like what is that is that good or is it

6299.219 --> 6303.4800000000005
like what the [ __ ]

6301.199 --> 6306.48
well it's good if I can order like the

6303.48 --> 6309.299999999999
gray Sports almanac for 2035 from it

6306.48 --> 6312.73
that'd be great so no I don't think you

6309.3 --> 6313.320000000001
can it doesn't not that

6312.73 --> 6315.32
[Music]

6313.32 --> 6315.32
right

6316.219 --> 6322.199
uh philosophers

6319.619 --> 6325.139
no it was literally Eric dubey's book

6322.199 --> 6328.94
like the Atlantean conspiracy I I had it

6325.139 --> 6328.9400000000005
in my hands in 2011.

6330.96 --> 6335.88
what sorry I was just taking a little

6333.54 --> 6338.06
shot at the bay right there because uh a

6335.88 --> 6340.1990000000005
lot of his material is sort of just re

6338.06 --> 6342.900000000001
rewriting what's already been written

6340.199 --> 6344.94
about a hundred years ago so right fair

6342.9 --> 6347.219
enough yeah his Source right

6344.94 --> 6350.28
right with all the nonsense in there

6347.219 --> 6352.139
that's very recognizable right okay

6350.28 --> 6354.239
actually that's something that you know

6352.139 --> 6356.1
what I the one piece from his material

6354.239 --> 6358.5599999999995
that I've always wanted to get my hands

6356.1 --> 6360.3
on and like I've looked and I I can't

6358.56 --> 6363.179
find it I'd love to know where he

6360.3 --> 6365.52
sources the information from the Voyages

6363.179 --> 6367.92
around Antarctica where he says that

6365.52 --> 6370.9800000000005
they go you know like I forget the

6367.92 --> 6373.02
number 60 000 my was it that high like

6370.98 --> 6375.239
it's it's an absurd amount that he says

6373.02 --> 6376.4400000000005
that that that they go and I've never

6375.239 --> 6378.718999999999
been able to find like the original

6376.44 --> 6382.98
journals or anything for that have you

6378.719 --> 6385.7390000000005
ever seen an actual source for that

6382.98 --> 6387.718999999999
no but I I do know about the book

6385.739 --> 6392.459999999999
there's one book

6387.719 --> 6395.88
of uh some a guy from Norway going to

6392.46 --> 6398.34
yeah to the north with his dad

6395.88 --> 6400.619
right after seeing that or heard that

6398.34 --> 6402.6
and then they go all the way there they

6400.619 --> 6404.639
even like get to another land and they

6402.6 --> 6405.96
meet giants that are like three to four

6404.639 --> 6408.0
meters tall

6405.96 --> 6410.34
and then they move even further north

6408.0 --> 6412.44
and then they end up at the south pole

6410.34 --> 6414.0
that way it's like they come out at the

6412.44 --> 6415.759999999999
other end

6414.0 --> 6418.5
right

6415.76 --> 6420.0
I do vaguely remember that now I forgot

6418.5 --> 6422.59
that it starts by going to the North

6420.0 --> 6424.32
Pole instead of the South

6422.59 --> 6427.619000000001
[Applause]

6424.32 --> 6429.84
Journey beyond the North Pole uh what

6427.619 --> 6434.599999999999
was it called I have the PDF on my

6429.84 --> 6434.6
computer hold on let me try to find it

6436.52 --> 6440.0
but it's not bad

6441.06 --> 6445.1
Captain bird is that no

6446.6 --> 6450.4400000000005
let me try to find it

6456.96 --> 6462.4800000000005
uh I have a lot of

6459.84 --> 6465.900000000001
PDFs from all over the place

6462.48 --> 6468.48
sure yeah me too I started

6465.9 --> 6471.9
like 25 years ago older called The

6468.48 --> 6473.4
X-Files on my computer and it's pretty

6471.9 --> 6475.679
full at this point

6473.4 --> 6478.0199999999995
right

6475.679 --> 6480.719
there's a good stuff it is like oh

6478.02 --> 6482.52
here's some technical PDF from Victor

6480.719 --> 6484.619
schauberger

6482.52 --> 6486.900000000001
like but I've never really looked into

6484.619 --> 6489.659
it it's just like I know that's really

6486.9 --> 6492.599999999999
valuable but uh

6489.659 --> 6496.0199999999995
it's also called Beyond worlds beyond

6492.6 --> 6498.139
the polls right okay is that it yeah

6496.02 --> 6501.0
that's it bye

6498.139 --> 6503.6990000000005
Amadeo giannini

6501.0 --> 6505.32
right are you sure because that's the

6503.699 --> 6507.299999999999
one where he

6505.32 --> 6509.219
I didn't remember him taking a physical

6507.3 --> 6512.6990000000005
trip in that book I thought that that

6509.219 --> 6515.4
was he was working with with a likely

6512.699 --> 6517.678999999999
space programs and he talks about how

6515.4 --> 6519.78
Picard's experiment pretty much shows

6517.679 --> 6522.06
how the Earth is flat and then he has a

6519.78 --> 6524.04
bunch of diagrams in there that are very

6522.06 --> 6527.1
interesting they look like hollowers

6524.04 --> 6529.8
diagrams but I've never actually quite

6527.1 --> 6533.34
understood what he's trying to to say

6529.8 --> 6534.96
with the circle that he has on him I

6533.34 --> 6536.58
didn't get that one it's by the way not

6534.96 --> 6539.0
the book that I actually meant this is

6536.58 --> 6542.88
not the one but this is another one

6539.0 --> 6544.58
yeah what was the name

6542.88 --> 6547.32
maybe somebody in the chat room

6544.58 --> 6549.84
remembers because it's it's not like

6547.32 --> 6553.159
Flat Earth is not in the title

6549.84 --> 6553.159000000001
right call again

6553.56 --> 6558.0
it is fascinating though I mean heck the

6556.02 --> 6560.219
uh the history of just North Pole

6558.0 --> 6562.199
Expeditions is pretty fascinating and

6560.219 --> 6564.9
how much garbage is involved with those

6562.199 --> 6566.4
and actually Eric Dubai did a pretty

6564.9 --> 6569.9
good video Once Upon a Time covering

6566.4 --> 6569.9
that too but uh

6570.3 --> 6575.46
it's just if if I had one point to make

6573.0 --> 6577.56
to people I guess I would make that I

6575.46 --> 6581.159
think that we kind of underestimate how

6577.56 --> 6583.400000000001
much of recorded history is essentially

6581.159 --> 6585.0
corporate propaganda

6583.4 --> 6588.96
yeah

6585.0 --> 6590.58
or theocracy propaganda I I think that

6588.96 --> 6592.26
most of History has basically been

6590.58 --> 6594.84
recreated

6592.26 --> 6598.139
and is mostly done by Jesuits in that

6594.84 --> 6600.719
era it's like Christ came

6598.139 --> 6602.639
and then the Catholic Church Rose and

6600.719 --> 6605.94
basically completely rewrote history

6602.639 --> 6608.28
everywhere right they started the modern

6605.94 --> 6610.5599999999995
history narrative system

6608.28 --> 6613.38
right and and that's inarguable with

6610.56 --> 6616.56
scallinger and and uh his his crownies

6613.38 --> 6618.659000000001
at the time but I I guess my point was

6616.56 --> 6620.400000000001
more that I think we sometimes forget

6618.659 --> 6622.44
because it's very easy in today's world

6620.4 --> 6624.138999999999
to see how Corporate propaganda is

6622.44 --> 6626.879999999999
essentially everywhere

6624.139 --> 6628.26
but I think that we we kind of

6626.88 --> 6630.6
underestimate that this has been going

6628.26 --> 6634.26
on for for centuries I mean the entire

6630.6 --> 6636.119000000001
new world was mapped out by a series of

6634.26 --> 6638.400000000001
you know the various East India

6636.119 --> 6641.82
companies West India companies et cetera

6638.4 --> 6644.58
Etc Dutch companies like it's anywhere

6641.82 --> 6647.88
you go all the plots of land in in North

6644.58 --> 6649.739
America well America we're divided up by

6647.88 --> 6652.5
these by these entities

6649.739 --> 6653.699
which is kind of kind of astounding when

6652.5 --> 6656.0
you start to view things through that

6653.699 --> 6656.0
lens

6656.4 --> 6660.138999999999
hold on yeah I can't find the PDF by the

6659.1 --> 6662.58
way

6660.139 --> 6665.400000000001
it's too freaking hot for this [ __ ]

6662.58 --> 6667.86
right uh

6665.4 --> 6670.0199999999995
uh sorry what were you saying

6667.86 --> 6672.48
entities

6670.02 --> 6674.46
basically just about how far back

6672.48 --> 6676.199
corporate propaganda goes and that it

6674.46 --> 6678.6
goes back much further than we think and

6676.199 --> 6681.36
it's really a lot of our history like

6678.6 --> 6683.400000000001
you're writing so much as the Jesuits

6681.36 --> 6685.98
and and the Catholic church and all that

6683.4 --> 6687.42
may have uh kind of kicked off the

6685.98 --> 6690.299999999999
modern

6687.42 --> 6692.219
chronology era so right but but I'm

6690.3 --> 6693.84
pretty sure that originally like we're

6692.219 --> 6697.139
always meant we were designed to get

6693.84 --> 6699.719
programming I mean sure as soon as we

6697.139 --> 6702.900000000001
were created we got programming from the

6699.719 --> 6705.3
from our shaper basically

6702.9 --> 6707.4
and what is left of that is like don't

6705.3 --> 6710.1
eat from the apple of knowledge of Good

6707.4 --> 6713.638999999999
and Evil right right so it's like

6710.1 --> 6715.8
instructions we get instructions right

6713.639 --> 6718.1990000000005
so God started the first instructions

6715.8 --> 6720.2390000000005
from that logic and then later man took

6718.199 --> 6723.0
it over and that has a significant

6720.239 --> 6724.259999999999
importance right we follow man or you

6723.0 --> 6726.6
follow God

6724.26 --> 6727.619000000001
right that's what that's pointing at for

6726.6 --> 6729.96
me

6727.619 --> 6731.639
right and I mean a lot of it is just the

6729.96 --> 6734.219
way that our perception almost

6731.639 --> 6736.32
necessarily has to work we have to

6734.219 --> 6738.6
formulate things into narratives in

6736.32 --> 6741.36
order to make sense out of anything

6738.6 --> 6744.360000000001
right because we need a cohesive Vision

6741.36 --> 6747.139
to guide us through things or we will

6744.36 --> 6749.94
break apart from what's Happening right

6747.139 --> 6753.3
but I think sometimes we equate reason

6749.94 --> 6755.339999999999
with with truth and that is only true to

6753.3 --> 6758.219
a degree it depends on what level of the

6755.34 --> 6760.32
conversation you're talking about

6758.219 --> 6763.32
right

6760.32 --> 6763.32
right

6763.56 --> 6769.5
I'm a bit overheating here hold on I

6768.0 --> 6773.4
love the conversation but I'm just

6769.5 --> 6775.32
cooking let's just yeah how how hot is

6773.4 --> 6777.36
it for you today I missed you given the

6775.32 --> 6779.82
the weather update it's around 30

6777.36 --> 6781.5599999999995
degrees but there's like no wind so

6779.82 --> 6784.619
that's like oh

6781.56 --> 6788.34
right so 30 that's about 82 Fahrenheit

6784.619 --> 6790.799999999999
then I guess I yeah I I've tried to

6788.34 --> 6793.02
train myself to do metric Imperial to

6790.8 --> 6796.52
metric conversions inside of my head it

6793.02 --> 6796.52
works sometimes

6797.04 --> 6802.44
to work

6799.139 --> 6804.36
well there's no reason to I stupid for

6802.44 --> 6807.48
what why the United States has to be

6804.36 --> 6808.44
different with that is beyond me at this

6807.48 --> 6811.379999999999
point

6808.44 --> 6814.5
I I'm not even certain that there's like

6811.38 --> 6815.719
a an any kind of Nefarious reason for it

6814.5 --> 6820.1
except for

6815.719 --> 6820.1
inertia well it was just all

6820.92 --> 6824.76
practical

6822.6 --> 6828.139
movies that were used before the metric

6824.76 --> 6832.139
system was introduced by the British

6828.139 --> 6834.119
Empire basically and right that's it

6832.139 --> 6836.88
but sure but like the British Empire

6834.119 --> 6838.98
doesn't you like they they abandoned it

6836.88 --> 6840.84
is the reason the U.S kept it more of

6838.98 --> 6844.138999999999
like well you're getting rid of it screw

6840.84 --> 6846.4800000000005
it or I'll keep it then right that's why

6844.139 --> 6849.659000000001
they didn't get rid of it in England

6846.48 --> 6852.599999999999
they do they use it there

6849.659 --> 6854.4
they still do we do in Europe like it's

6852.6 --> 6856.08
the United States and a couple of other

6854.4 --> 6858.5599999999995
countries around the world that don't

6856.08 --> 6858.5599999999995
use it

6858.719 --> 6865.32
right that the in the Imperial says I

6863.04 --> 6867.9
mean like your road signs are all

6865.32 --> 6869.04
kilometers right like yeah miles per

6867.9 --> 6871.199
yeah

6869.04 --> 6873.0199999999995
so I guess it depends on what you mean

6871.199 --> 6877.619
by use but

6873.02 --> 6880.320000000001
the meaning of is is oh but I mean our

6877.619 --> 6882.9
rulers are in centimeters

6880.32 --> 6884.0
are traffic signs as you said are in

6882.9 --> 6888.0
kilometers

6884.0 --> 6890.58
and yeah and I mean there are also inch

6888.0 --> 6892.5
options just in case but like everything

6890.58 --> 6893.76
is here just done in centimeters

6892.5 --> 6895.98
everywhere in Europe

6893.76 --> 6898.52
right in most of the world

6895.98 --> 6898.5199999999995
right

6900.92 --> 6906.36
so uh

6903.06 --> 6908.820000000001
yeah going back slightly then I uh just

6906.36 --> 6911.219
talking about corporate propaganda and

6908.82 --> 6913.259999999999
this is one of my hobby horses because I

6911.219 --> 6917.219
I always hate it when when people get on

6913.26 --> 6920.280000000001
it but uh I I'm uh not a huge fan of

6917.219 --> 6923.1
Nikola Tesla

6920.28 --> 6925.5
I think that Tesla was largely a

6923.1 --> 6927.6
creation of Westinghouse

6925.5 --> 6929.82
um and I mean he definitely worked for

6927.6 --> 6932.76
them George Westinghouse himself is

6929.82 --> 6935.34
supposed to be quite the inventor like a

6932.76 --> 6937.38
savant so to speak he invented several

6935.34 --> 6938.219
things as a teenager

6937.38 --> 6940.679
um

6938.219 --> 6944.699
but I I always find it interesting

6940.679 --> 6946.36
because Tesla just his rise to kind of

6944.699 --> 6948.299999999999
infamy during the internet

6946.36 --> 6951.719
[Music]

6948.3 --> 6953.9400000000005
oh we're breaking up

6951.719 --> 6957.4800000000005
oh [ __ ] I'm breaking up this is not good

6953.94 --> 6960.299999999999
hold on my internet might be cracking

6957.48 --> 6961.739
uh it's back

6960.3 --> 6964.5
okay

6961.739 --> 6965.82
can you hear me now yes I can hear you

6964.5 --> 6968.4
wonderful

6965.82 --> 6970.739
so so yeah because even like for

6968.4 --> 6973.259999999999
instance when the more guile came on uh

6970.739 --> 6975.54
fed briefly the the last week or

6973.26 --> 6978.0
whenever that was and he's talking about

6975.54 --> 6980.82
I more tend to believe in the Tesla like

6978.0 --> 6984.54
I don't know I I find Tesla to be such a

6980.82 --> 6987.54
almost a meme at this point that it's

6984.54 --> 6992.04
it's curious to me a little bit why he's

6987.54 --> 6993.239
been elevated to almost as a christ-like

6992.04 --> 6995.639
position

6993.239 --> 6998.459999999999
when uh if you actually look at his work

6995.639 --> 7000.619
there's a lot of a lot of great failures

6998.46 --> 7002.9
in the later half of his life and even

7000.619 --> 7006.5599999999995
his large accomplishments such as the uh

7002.9 --> 7008.119
the uh work at Niagara Falls and and

7006.56 --> 7010.580000000001
powering Buffalo

7008.119 --> 7012.799999999999
um that was not actually the first

7010.58 --> 7015.08
long-distance uh transmission of

7012.8 --> 7017.360000000001
electricity there was got a couple out

7015.08 --> 7019.76
in California before that and they used

7017.36 --> 7023.0599999999995
three-phase uh generators as opposed to

7019.76 --> 7025.04
Tesla's two-phase model which is like

7023.06 --> 7027.38
three phase essentially now is what what

7025.04 --> 7028.76
they use like that's still kind of the

7027.38 --> 7031.639
the current technology when you're

7028.76 --> 7033.860000000001
talking about hydroelectricity and uh

7031.639 --> 7035.719
yeah so his engine was kind of almost

7033.86 --> 7038.598999999999
out of date by the time he was using it

7035.719 --> 7040.76
and his his accomplishments uh his jet

7038.599 --> 7043.099
generators I mean his accomplishments

7040.76 --> 7044.719
were kind of like when you go through

7043.099 --> 7046.159000000001
and you read all the newspapers and the

7044.719 --> 7048.26
press release it's a hundred percent

7046.159 --> 7051.08
just corporate press releases that got

7048.26 --> 7054.619000000001
shot back into the newspaper and that's

7051.08 --> 7056.54
kind of how his Legend began and maybe

7054.619 --> 7058.4
why he kind of disappeared from the

7056.54 --> 7060.5
public narrative until relatively

7058.4 --> 7063.138999999999
recently because he was just another guy

7060.5 --> 7065.08
people in the late 19th century were

7063.139 --> 7068.06
inventing all kinds of things

7065.08 --> 7069.98
independently of each other right Tesla

7068.06 --> 7072.34
himself for his uh

7069.98 --> 7075.5
for his uh uh

7072.34 --> 7078.9800000000005
work shared the patent with a guy named

7075.5 --> 7081.38
Galileo Ferraris which is interesting to

7078.98 --> 7083.36
me too

7081.38 --> 7085.219
right so you really looked into the

7083.36 --> 7088.0
details of this that's interesting

7085.219 --> 7092.659
because I think that

7088.0 --> 7095.3
Tesla is kind of like the other Einstein

7092.659 --> 7097.098999999999
who was also like really put as a core

7095.3 --> 7099.56
figure to always be referencing

7097.099 --> 7102.7390000000005
historically right so in that sense

7099.56 --> 7106.46
Tesla is mainstream he's just like on

7102.739 --> 7108.44
the back burner right and then that but

7106.46 --> 7111.38
there's this thing you see I think there

7108.44 --> 7113.239
might be a very specific reason why they

7111.38 --> 7118.54
pull them forward

7113.239 --> 7118.54
and that is because he was an etherite

7118.58 --> 7123.5599999999995
yes and that seems to be the new and I

7121.76 --> 7125.719
think that is actually that is the

7123.56 --> 7128.780000000001
reason why he was repromoted

7125.719 --> 7130.58
because he was wrong in certain things

7128.78 --> 7132.98
and

7130.58 --> 7135.5599999999995
and they want that mistake to basically

7132.98 --> 7138.44
Blossom up and it has happened there are

7135.56 --> 7140.3
it's again a popular theory that has no

7138.44 --> 7142.339999999999
proof

7140.3 --> 7145.04
again right

7142.34 --> 7146.84
yeah no he I definitely tend to agree

7145.04 --> 7150.679
with that assessment right there and

7146.84 --> 7153.139
it's just yeah they either there's such

7150.679 --> 7156.139
a connection between that entire topic

7153.139 --> 7158.2390000000005
and I think the New Age movement I mean

7156.139 --> 7160.099
and that's a very nebulous term in the

7158.239 --> 7162.08
same way that ether is and then you can

7160.099 --> 7164.54
go back to you know the turn of the

7162.08 --> 7167.0
century with a lot of that too

7164.54 --> 7169.28
um and it's just funny to me that that

7167.0 --> 7172.04
ether keeps on kicking around at least

7169.28 --> 7174.38
and to be clear again I hate the term

7172.04 --> 7176.179
because it's very easy to confuse it

7174.38 --> 7178.34
with other things I think when we're

7176.179 --> 7180.679
talking about either right here and I

7178.34 --> 7182.3
didn't say this and kind of got shot it

7180.679 --> 7184.04
down a little bit it's more like we're

7182.3 --> 7186.56
talking about the Zero Point Energy

7184.04 --> 7188.119
slash hyper dimensional physics whatever

7186.56 --> 7191.2390000000005
you want to call it the whole background

7188.119 --> 7194.42
medium situation because but that's all

7191.239 --> 7198.44
of it though it is that's what it always

7194.42 --> 7200.659
has been it's like it's the thing that

7198.44 --> 7202.04
makes light possible it's the thing that

7200.659 --> 7204.759999999999
makes electricity it's like the

7202.04 --> 7204.76
background thing

7206.5 --> 7213.5
thought that too he did

7210.86 --> 7216.0199999999995
so it was a reification

7213.5 --> 7217.76
and it's been re

7216.02 --> 7220.52
dug up

7217.76 --> 7222.26
like hey go go and play with this you

7220.52 --> 7225.679
know stop talking about Flat Earth and

7222.26 --> 7228.56
just go on this free energy and and

7225.679 --> 7231.26
ether nonsense right talk about that

7228.56 --> 7233.3
because that doesn't lead anywhere

7231.26 --> 7236.719
but it does make you feel very special

7233.3 --> 7238.88
though no right well and that that's the

7236.719 --> 7240.5
key I mean going back to con Capers I

7238.88 --> 7242.3
it's it's the specialness that's

7240.5 --> 7243.679
important right there that you've

7242.3 --> 7245.84
figured out something that nobody else

7243.679 --> 7247.88
has figured out and let's not get this

7245.84 --> 7250.04
wrong a lot of us in that topic have to

7247.88 --> 7252.32
deal with that mentality but it's it's a

7250.04 --> 7255.199
matter of trying to ground yourself with

7252.32 --> 7256.94
empiricism I I think that stops you from

7255.199 --> 7258.32
going too overboard with that sort of

7256.94 --> 7260.419999999999
thing

7258.32 --> 7263.0599999999995
right because it's more like a math game

7260.42 --> 7265.639
it's a math trick right what they do is

7263.06 --> 7267.4400000000005
just oh just see it on everything inside

7265.639 --> 7269.78
out it's all how that relativity

7267.44 --> 7271.58
nonsense works too like oh just start

7269.78 --> 7273.86
imagining oh something is falling now

7271.58 --> 7276.98
think of it as not falling but the thing

7273.86 --> 7279.139
Rising towards it oh yes see how it's

7276.98 --> 7281.299999999999
completely disconnected from reality

7279.139 --> 7283.88
they don't say that part but that's

7281.3 --> 7285.860000000001
basically it so let's just give you more

7283.88 --> 7289.159000000001
stuff to think about to disconnect

7285.86 --> 7290.9
yourself to imagine that things are

7289.159 --> 7293.78
completely different

7290.9 --> 7295.4
as what your normal senses will tell you

7293.78 --> 7297.679
right

7295.4 --> 7300.86
well it's I mean we eventually hit a

7297.679 --> 7302.599
wall with what's knowable and you need

7300.86 --> 7304.639
to start making presumptions if you want

7302.599 --> 7307.46
to create your theory of everything and

7304.639 --> 7309.8
theories of everything are and have

7307.46 --> 7311.42
always been super popular

7309.8 --> 7315.4400000000005
because there's a lot of power in them

7311.42 --> 7317.36
obviously so it's it's a good trick you

7315.44 --> 7319.339999999999
know why it's popular because people

7317.36 --> 7321.5599999999995
just can't let go that they want to be

7319.34 --> 7323.42
God and understand everything and that

7321.56 --> 7325.820000000001
they think that they have the pattern

7323.42 --> 7328.04
for all things it's like yeah that's

7325.82 --> 7329.96
cute you barely even understand what

7328.04 --> 7331.5199999999995
that is like the things that you're

7329.96 --> 7332.4800000000005
putting together you don't know what

7331.52 --> 7336.320000000001
they are

7332.48 --> 7339.08
you're just gonna with the it has to be

7336.32 --> 7340.759999999999
one thing oh really does it well you

7339.08 --> 7342.38
have to actually understand what it is

7340.76 --> 7345.08
in order to even make a connection

7342.38 --> 7347.42
properly and most of these things have

7345.08 --> 7349.88
all been defined in ways that are very

7347.42 --> 7352.34
misleading I mean they say oh light is a

7349.88 --> 7354.9800000000005
wave no it isn't but it's a frequency it

7352.34 --> 7357.26
has to be a wave yeah but it isn't

7354.98 --> 7359.178999999999
that thing that you think is a frequency

7357.26 --> 7362.119000000001
or it's a different speed or a

7359.179 --> 7365.0
wavelength that's all literally made up

7362.119 --> 7367.28
it isn't actually that it's named that

7365.0 --> 7368.84
because they didn't know what else to

7367.28 --> 7371.179
designate it as

7368.84 --> 7373.76
and that's the reason why they just use

7371.179 --> 7376.88
wave modeling because they don't know

7373.76 --> 7379.88
how else to even Define that it is there

7376.88 --> 7381.8
right I mean let's face it a lot of

7379.88 --> 7384.32
people's knowledge comes from just very

7381.8 --> 7387.02
generalized things I think what was that

7384.32 --> 7389.54
the DAC quote-unquote documentary the

7387.02 --> 7390.580000000001
what the bleep touched on some of the

7389.54 --> 7392.54
you know

7390.58 --> 7393.92
uncertainty and I think that's where a

7392.54 --> 7396.32
lot of people's understanding of it

7393.92 --> 7398.54
comes from and it is I do understand why

7396.32 --> 7400.759999999999
if you get into the details of quantum

7398.54 --> 7402.08
mechanics and the people that write

7400.76 --> 7404.54
about it they make it almost

7402.08 --> 7406.639
impenetrable to the average person like

7404.54 --> 7408.38
I definitely did not have but they just

7406.639 --> 7410.4800000000005
want to blow your mind with science so

7408.38 --> 7412.400000000001
you'll just be like wow and believe

7410.48 --> 7414.879999999999
everything they say

7412.4 --> 7417.98
yeah right I mean yes

7414.88 --> 7420.02
it's using specific terminology to make

7417.98 --> 7423.199
it impenetrable to the average person

7420.02 --> 7425.06
and then then the terminality it gets

7423.199 --> 7426.678999999999
really rough when then they double speak

7425.06 --> 7428.0
with the term analogy that sometimes

7426.679 --> 7430.58
it'll mean one thing and sometimes it

7428.0 --> 7432.639
means something else so

7430.58 --> 7432.639
yeah

7432.679 --> 7437.659
I mean everything is quantum now like

7435.32 --> 7438.98
they just you have quantum gravity if

7437.659 --> 7441.32
even though that's absolutely

7438.98 --> 7443.659
self-conflicting

7441.32 --> 7445.94
so they just use the word Quantum but

7443.659 --> 7448.58
nobody that actually sticks the word

7445.94 --> 7451.28
Quantum on their supposed test or thing

7448.58 --> 7454.219
that they think they figured out ever

7451.28 --> 7457.639
relates to quantum mechanics in any way

7454.219 --> 7460.099
like ever it never does it's not even

7457.639 --> 7462.04
vaguely related when they call things

7460.099 --> 7464.42
Quantum

7462.04 --> 7465.98
Quantum Computing oh really what does it

7464.42 --> 7469.099
have to do with quantum mechanics oh

7465.98 --> 7471.619
absolutely nothing it's just a vague

7469.099 --> 7474.26
story that sort of seems related to

7471.619 --> 7475.94
Quantum Mechanics yeah yeah it isn't

7474.26 --> 7478.159000000001
though

7475.94 --> 7480.32
right it's a complete myth quantum

7478.159 --> 7482.299999999999
computer oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

7480.32 --> 7484.759999999999
just called a really fast computer

7482.3 --> 7485.679
like how computers work how microchips

7484.76 --> 7489.02
work

7485.679 --> 7491.06
defies our understanding already right

7489.02 --> 7493.280000000001
and that probably does have to do with

7491.06 --> 7494.780000000001
Quantum mechanic the point is we don't

7493.28 --> 7496.82
know how

7494.78 --> 7499.04
right the people that design these

7496.82 --> 7500.96
freaking things barely know how anymore

7499.04 --> 7503.78
because they have so much computerized

7500.96 --> 7506.3
assistance right they don't even

7503.78 --> 7508.58
understand how it's working anymore it

7506.3 --> 7510.8
just does it just they just keep trying

7508.58 --> 7512.179
to find the patterns that work

7510.8 --> 7515.4800000000005
that's it

7512.179 --> 7517.34
right well and again for lots of reasons

7515.48 --> 7519.739
because knowledge is so specialized

7517.34 --> 7521.719
nowadays you have a very strict field

7519.739 --> 7524.419999999999
that you tend to stick with there's very

7521.719 --> 7526.159
few Renaissance men so to speak anymore

7524.42 --> 7528.1990000000005
that can know how it all fits together

7526.159 --> 7530.36
and I mean we really are as a

7528.199 --> 7532.58
civilization heading towards a a very

7530.36 --> 7534.08
dangerous spot because when you don't

7532.58 --> 7537.26
even have people that know how to fix

7534.08 --> 7539.0
the electric grid anymore because like

7537.26 --> 7540.320000000001
literally it was their grandfathers that

7539.0 --> 7542.599
put it together and they were never

7540.32 --> 7545.599
trained in the property to hook it back

7542.599 --> 7548.42
up we're heading for for trouble real

7545.599 --> 7550.76
well it's the same look what we are what

7548.42 --> 7554.2390000000005
we're experiencing right now

7550.76 --> 7557.599
is a peak of theocracy

7554.239 --> 7559.459999999999
right so what's happened supposedly and

7557.599 --> 7563.119000000001
how exactly it happened I'm not sure but

7559.46 --> 7564.5
the way it's portrayed medieval times at

7563.119 --> 7566.9
theocracy

7564.5 --> 7570.199
at feudalism

7566.9 --> 7572.42
yeah and a lot of Wars well guess what's

7570.199 --> 7575.839999999999
happening right now we got

7572.42 --> 7578.179
Neo feudalism we got a a mystery

7575.84 --> 7580.9400000000005
religion that's been building for like a

7578.179 --> 7583.639
hundred years roughly that's now

7580.94 --> 7586.4
secretly the ruling faction in the world

7583.639 --> 7589.099
it's the ruling truth so we got a

7586.4 --> 7591.799999999999
theocracy we got Neo feudalism

7589.099 --> 7595.2390000000005
and guess what else we got Wars and

7591.8 --> 7598.400000000001
Siege and corporations and money

7595.239 --> 7601.459999999999
organizations shutting down under order

7598.4 --> 7603.82
of the feudalists so we're literally

7601.46 --> 7607.099
going through the exact same

7603.82 --> 7608.0
civilization pattern as in the theocracy

7607.099 --> 7610.6990000000005
age

7608.0 --> 7613.699
right when Catholicism was the ruling

7610.699 --> 7617.0
religion in the west and it is again

7613.699 --> 7620.0
because they invent the freaking globe

7617.0 --> 7621.92
right and so it's the same thing same

7620.0 --> 7625.28
thing new coat

7621.92 --> 7626.9
yes exactly and to be clear it's it's

7625.28 --> 7629.0599999999995
always working at a couple different

7626.9 --> 7632.0
levels right there you have the the

7629.06 --> 7635.179
religion so to speak of the masses which

7632.0 --> 7637.28
as we know is is scientism heliocentrism

7635.179 --> 7638.719
all that all that sort of stuff and back

7637.28 --> 7640.34
then in West Christianity and

7638.719 --> 7641.84
Catholicism and the Christians would be

7640.34 --> 7643.34
like yeah we know what Christians is and

7641.84 --> 7646.639
the Catholics would always like try to

7643.34 --> 7648.139
draw in new stuff to convolute it and

7646.639 --> 7650.78
expand upon it

7648.139 --> 7652.88
and then they expanded so far that

7650.78 --> 7655.34
eventually like it just people just

7652.88 --> 7657.1990000000005
stopped even like yeah whatever they say

7655.34 --> 7659.4800000000005
it they're not even gonna get involved

7657.199 --> 7662.719
anymore because they keep making up [ __ ]

7659.48 --> 7665.598999999999
right kind of like what NASA does and

7662.719 --> 7667.4
people are like yeah whatever NASA

7665.599 --> 7669.619000000001
you're doing all that way it looks

7667.4 --> 7671.9
shitty like we're not even gonna get in

7669.619 --> 7674.36
like you just do that whatever

7671.9 --> 7675.739
exactly like what happened during the

7674.36 --> 7678.5599999999995
theocracy

7675.739 --> 7680.54
right people get saturated and they just

7678.56 --> 7683.119000000001
like you just do whatever you do we

7680.54 --> 7685.82
don't even want to get involved anymore

7683.119 --> 7687.679
right because it's so much [ __ ] that

7685.82 --> 7689.84
actually gave me an interesting kind of

7687.679 --> 7693.08
thought to for kind of a lens to view

7689.84 --> 7696.139
the last few years over because I I do

7693.08 --> 7699.08
think that it's that the average person

7696.139 --> 7701.96
whatever that means or rather a sizable

7699.08 --> 7706.76
percentage of the population has become

7701.96 --> 7708.679
aware of how quote-unquote science and

7706.76 --> 7710.360000000001
like again you get guys like Jaren that

7708.679 --> 7712.639
try to Define that in a certain way but

7710.36 --> 7714.38
I think the pandemic really lifted the

7712.639 --> 7717.5
veil for a lot of people in that regard

7714.38 --> 7721.400000000001
but I don't know if they're anywhere

7717.5 --> 7723.32
near the core idea of like heliocentrism

7721.4 --> 7725.96
and and how that's really the the

7723.32 --> 7728.36
foundation of all of this I don't know

7725.96 --> 7730.58
how much that's gone away and

7728.36 --> 7733.639
I just think it's interesting that

7730.58 --> 7736.159
perhaps as one of the many goals of what

7733.639 --> 7738.38
the pandemic was it was to act as a

7736.159 --> 7740.54
little bit of a release valve for for

7738.38 --> 7742.76
people that were angry at the at the

7740.54 --> 7744.44
current religion like so now there's

7742.76 --> 7746.719
there's a group of people that you can

7744.44 --> 7749.659
yell at like what medical quote-unquote

7746.719 --> 7752.0
science is doing and and whatnot but

7749.659 --> 7753.799999999999
they still aren't really approaching the

7752.0 --> 7756.619
the core idea that set this all into

7753.8 --> 7759.8
motion but it's like the priests bring

7756.619 --> 7761.36
in like a story of a devil or the devil

7759.8 --> 7762.92
is coming he's trying to corrupt people

7761.36 --> 7765.0199999999995
and oh

7762.92 --> 7766.82
and eventually people are like we hate

7765.02 --> 7768.860000000001
this [ __ ] double they don't know that

7766.82 --> 7770.54
it's just made up but the things are

7768.86 --> 7771.98
happening it's being blamed on the devil

7770.54 --> 7773.84
they're going to be angry the [ __ ]

7771.98 --> 7777.44
devil what is the devil always ruining

7773.84 --> 7780.32
our lives right and then oh look these

7777.44 --> 7784.04
people cooperate with the Devil

7780.32 --> 7786.139
they are accomplices and so then people

7784.04 --> 7789.08
are like ah

7786.139 --> 7791.4400000000005
they're the Devils right and it's all

7789.08 --> 7795.679
appointed by the church

7791.44 --> 7797.96
and that could even like it's just like

7795.679 --> 7800.599
spy novels it's like they have people

7797.96 --> 7802.76
working for them and then it's like oh

7800.599 --> 7805.34
situation is not working anymore okay

7802.76 --> 7806.900000000001
let them just fall so they're just gonna

7805.34 --> 7808.6990000000005
be thrown in front of the people like

7806.9 --> 7810.08
these are the guilty ones

7808.699 --> 7811.699
right

7810.08 --> 7814.099
even though they were just working for

7811.699 --> 7815.659
the big organization right I mean

7814.099 --> 7817.639
nothing new Under the Sun they do this

7815.659 --> 7819.799999999999
all the time still

7817.639 --> 7822.02
right oh this it's not working anymore

7819.8 --> 7823.820000000001
quickly throw this person under the bus

7822.02 --> 7826.040000000001
and and blame everything that's happened

7823.82 --> 7828.46
on that one individual

7826.04 --> 7831.0199999999995
so we could just move on

7828.46 --> 7832.699
and again I think as human beings that's

7831.02 --> 7835.280000000001
kind of hard for us to sometimes

7832.699 --> 7838.46
conceptualize that there's often a lot

7835.28 --> 7841.58
of goals uh working simultaneously and

7838.46 --> 7845.0
in any given large-scale event has is

7841.58 --> 7846.8
serves like whether it's planned out to

7845.0 --> 7849.44
be that way or whether it's incidentally

7846.8 --> 7852.5
it ends up serving a lot of different

7849.44 --> 7855.799999999999
agendas at the same time like and I do

7852.5 --> 7858.739
Wonder because now we're starting to see

7855.8 --> 7861.92
some of the measures being floated out

7858.739 --> 7864.44
as far as lockdowns masking stuff of

7861.92 --> 7866.42
that nature and there does seem to be a

7864.44 --> 7869.36
decent pushback now which

7866.42 --> 7872.179
I would like to believe is positive but

7869.36 --> 7873.98
it does make you wonder if that isn't as

7872.179 --> 7878.36
kind of you said that we're going to end

7873.98 --> 7880.098999999999
up hanging Dr fauci to pay for the sins

7878.36 --> 7882.32
of his Brethren and like that doesn't

7880.099 --> 7884.3
get to the root cause at all yeah I'm

7882.32 --> 7888.739
still all for it though it's like yeah

7884.3 --> 7891.5
let's just do that and then yay now the

7888.739 --> 7893.419999999999
next layer and it's like yeah oh now we

7891.5 --> 7895.34
just move oh you thought you were you

7893.42 --> 7897.8
were saying no now let's move to the

7895.34 --> 7902.179
next layer line up

7897.8 --> 7905.659000000001
right that's what I'm waiting for I mean

7902.179 --> 7909.92
to put it bluntly though it's it's very

7905.659 --> 7911.78
fascinating that to me again always the

7909.92 --> 7914.4800000000005
ugly just the preface this the elites

7911.78 --> 7916.88
that the powers that be quote unquote

7914.48 --> 7919.699
these are never a monolith in my mind

7916.88 --> 7922.639
it's constantly a war in Heaven There

7919.699 --> 7924.98
are different factions people don't even

7922.639 --> 7927.4400000000005
necessarily belong to one faction or

7924.98 --> 7929.839999999999
another and they'll sway in between but

7927.44 --> 7931.46
like I see the groundwork very easily

7929.84 --> 7933.5
being laid when you talk about somebody

7931.46 --> 7935.9
like Elon Musk right now I mean because

7933.5 --> 7939.08
what does Elon Musk have he has a space

7935.9 --> 7942.46
program and he's positioning himself as

7939.08 --> 7945.5
you know Free Speech Advocate uh

7942.46 --> 7948.38
anti-vaxxer quote unquote yeah it's all

7945.5 --> 7952.639
horseshit I mean he's literally just

7948.38 --> 7955.099
taking on the new coach the pr coats

7952.639 --> 7957.619
he's like oh we're gonna do this now oh

7955.099 --> 7959.360000000001
everybody's gonna side with me then it's

7957.619 --> 7960.799999999999
like they're trying to make it into some

7959.36 --> 7962.36
kind of folk hero all of a sudden

7960.8 --> 7965.54
ridiculous

7962.36 --> 7967.0599999999995
also for the record I don't like he's a

7965.54 --> 7971.78
he's a [ __ ]

7967.06 --> 7973.34
he is not whatever like I think that he

7971.78 --> 7976.579
definitely probably caused some shots

7973.34 --> 7978.619000000001
but like it is as simple as listening to

7976.579 --> 7980.78
him speak a lot of times this is not a

7978.619 --> 7983.239
very intelligent man he has some

7980.78 --> 7985.4
business savvy and whatnot but he's not

7983.239 --> 7987.379999999999
the genius of our times or any kind of

7985.4 --> 7989.36
Mastermind I feel the same way he's just

7987.38 --> 7992.06
not a thinker like he's not somebody

7989.36 --> 7994.579
that's continually thinking like me or

7992.06 --> 7996.139
you like people that's like once you

7994.579 --> 7998.54
break their mouth open they can't shut

7996.139 --> 8000.46
the [ __ ] up that's the real thinkers

7998.54 --> 8003.4
like they have to hold it back because

8000.46 --> 8005.619
normies can't handle them like Elon Musk

8003.4 --> 8007.9
isn't like that at all he seems to be

8005.619 --> 8008.739
very very comfortable just not thinking

8007.9 --> 8012.82
anything

8008.739 --> 8015.098999999999
yes like okay I would be I I can't do

8012.82 --> 8017.159
that like I'm literally incapable of

8015.099 --> 8020.38
doing that

8017.159 --> 8022.78
so yeah he's not I mean he might not

8020.38 --> 8026.52
even be as dumb as it just seems

8022.78 --> 8030.159
sometimes but he's definitely not like a

8026.52 --> 8031.84
a disciplined thinker type

8030.159 --> 8033.04
he's not a real he's not a real

8031.84 --> 8035.860000000001
professor

8033.04 --> 8038.0199999999995
correct at all yes and again I think

8035.86 --> 8040.719
guys like that do have certain his

8038.02 --> 8043.4800000000005
business Acumen and well his ability to

8040.719 --> 8044.92
backstab is is pretty good like I said

8043.48 --> 8047.98
him and Bill Gates are really pretty

8044.92 --> 8049.9
similar in a lot of regards like people

8047.98 --> 8052.119
like to point to Bill Gates as some kind

8049.9 --> 8054.159
of a mastermind and I ain't heck I feel

8052.119 --> 8056.5
even as far to say that about like Clash

8054.159 --> 8059.32
Schwab a lot out of these guys are just

8056.5 --> 8061.599
high on their own Supply like it's it's

8059.32 --> 8065.139
not exactly James Bond villain territory

8061.599 --> 8067.360000000001
but it is actually it's just that it's

8065.139 --> 8070.06
so cartoonish the reality turned out to

8067.36 --> 8073.48
be more cartoonish than the

8070.06 --> 8075.52
cartoon fictional versions that were put

8073.48 --> 8078.098999999999
in movies it's like no the reality is

8075.52 --> 8080.02
worse yes you're correct I was giving

8078.099 --> 8081.579
James Bond villains more confidence than

8080.02 --> 8083.139
they actually have but we've thought it

8081.579 --> 8085.42
back then right we're watching it's like

8083.139 --> 8088.06
nah this is so cartoonish and then it's

8085.42 --> 8090.82
like uh yeah now it's actually the real

8088.06 --> 8092.4400000000005
thing on TV and it's worse it's like

8090.82 --> 8095.739
you're looking at that and it's like

8092.44 --> 8100.178999999999
this is embarrassing right and the core

8095.739 --> 8102.82
of it always is the desire to help it's

8100.179 --> 8104.86
the desire to help everybody though and

8102.82 --> 8107.32
believing that you're the one that can

8104.86 --> 8110.0199999999995
help everybody like that's the most

8107.32 --> 8113.98
dangerous mindset that there is

8110.02 --> 8115.3
well I mean yeah no not necessarily it's

8113.98 --> 8117.459999999999
just that

8115.3 --> 8118.54
if you're gonna insist on helping

8117.46 --> 8121.659
everybody

8118.54 --> 8123.82
right if you're not if you don't care

8121.659 --> 8125.32
whether people are gonna willingly go

8123.82 --> 8127.239
along if you're just like no everybody

8125.32 --> 8128.739
has to change

8127.239 --> 8130.239
and we're gonna try to change their

8128.739 --> 8132.82
minds but if that doesn't work we're

8130.239 --> 8134.5599999999995
still gonna force it like that's the

8132.82 --> 8136.0
issue is that these people have these

8134.56 --> 8138.579000000001
ideas about

8136.0 --> 8140.32
turning everybody into capital and

8138.579 --> 8141.699
they're just like telling you to your

8140.32 --> 8143.44
face it's like yeah we're literally

8141.699 --> 8146.919999999999
gonna turn you into a slave when people

8143.44 --> 8149.44
are just like this is so surreal like

8146.92 --> 8152.139
it's really The Surreal Factor sometimes

8149.44 --> 8154.54
that I think is basically preventing

8152.139 --> 8155.619
people from just straight out assaulting

8154.54 --> 8158.619
them

8155.619 --> 8160.299999999999
because it's so surreal

8158.619 --> 8161.799999999999
basically

8160.3 --> 8163.4800000000005
still there right

8161.8 --> 8165.639
yeah all right I've got some internet

8163.48 --> 8167.0199999999995
issues but it's back

8165.639 --> 8169.06
okay

8167.02 --> 8172.92
yeah don't totally agree with all that

8169.06 --> 8175.360000000001
that's that's exactly exactly right um

8172.92 --> 8177.88
but it's wearing off by the way it's

8175.36 --> 8179.5599999999995
like people aren't as shocked anymore

8177.88 --> 8181.84
people are now just getting irritated

8179.56 --> 8184.0
like it's like yeah

8181.84 --> 8186.34
we're not so shocked anymore that we're

8184.0 --> 8190.0
just baffled we're we're like no you

8186.34 --> 8192.219000000001
really suck and we really wanted rid of

8190.0 --> 8193.899
you like that's that's what it's

8192.219 --> 8196.3
starting to turn into so that original

8193.899 --> 8198.519
shock effect it did work it worked since

8196.3 --> 8199.539999999999
the Obama age it worked basically like a

8198.519 --> 8203.139000000001
decade

8199.54 --> 8207.160000000002
the Spells worn off people are now like

8203.139 --> 8208.199999999999
yeah that was cute we don't want this

8207.16 --> 8211.899
anymore

8208.2 --> 8214.54
like we're not gonna do it anymore

8211.899 --> 8216.58
it's diminishing returns I mean I think

8214.54 --> 8218.800000000001
back again the plan for the New American

8216.58 --> 8221.26
Century the whole you know the

8218.8 --> 8223.719
catalyzing event that that is necessary

8221.26 --> 8225.82
that they referred to in that

8223.719 --> 8229.178999999998
documentation but it's also kind of

8225.82 --> 8232.359
similar to how how movies function like

8229.179 --> 8234.399
like uh or or television shows for that

8232.359 --> 8237.58
matter that if you're going to add the

8234.399 --> 8239.5
Big World threatening event I mean the

8237.58 --> 8241.0
MCU in total right now and why that's

8239.5 --> 8242.74
starting to struggle they built up to

8241.0 --> 8244.12
the big event now you can't do it again

8242.74 --> 8246.58
because you're going to have diminishing

8244.12 --> 8248.979000000001
returns every time MCU that's the same

8246.58 --> 8251.019
thing with everything in reality what

8248.979 --> 8253.779999999999
are you talking about MCU

8251.019 --> 8256.42
the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how it

8253.78 --> 8258.460000000001
all built up to end game and Thanos yeah

8256.42 --> 8260.5
now they don't really have a coherent

8258.46 --> 8263.32
way to go forward yeah but it's always

8260.5 --> 8266.26
like that that's that's a storytelling

8263.32 --> 8267.88
problem yes it's like oh you build up to

8266.26 --> 8269.859
the climax and then it's completely

8267.88 --> 8271.358999999999
[ __ ] and just all the energy just

8269.859 --> 8273.82
drains out of it

8271.359 --> 8276.639000000001
right because big climaxes in big

8273.82 --> 8279.279999999999
building stories tend to yield massive

8276.639 --> 8282.399
depression so unless you're literally

8279.28 --> 8284.979000000001
gonna play on that and it's like a

8282.399 --> 8286.599
post-world war depression type which is

8284.979 --> 8289.3
logical because it does actually happen

8286.599 --> 8291.519
you can build on it but if you just no

8289.3 --> 8293.8
no we want more there's more power so

8291.519 --> 8296.979
we're gonna grow more we're gonna Dragon

8293.8 --> 8298.139
Ball Z this right well it just doesn't

8296.979 --> 8301.66
work

8298.139 --> 8304.358999999999
because usually after massive power and

8301.66 --> 8306.399
energy exchange and Wars there's

8304.359 --> 8309.58
depression there's crippling depression

8306.399 --> 8313.0
after that and PTSD everywhere

8309.58 --> 8315.219
right but nobody nobody wants to go and

8313.0 --> 8316.599
pay 14 to go see that in the movie

8315.219 --> 8317.8
theater

8316.599 --> 8319.74
right

8317.8 --> 8323.08
because that would basically be

8319.74 --> 8324.88
admitting we've had our Peak right

8323.08 --> 8328.599
because every Peak

8324.88 --> 8331.598999999998
goes down you can't keep Rising forever

8328.599 --> 8333.880000000001
right that's literally impossible yeah

8331.599 --> 8335.92
so no matter what you try no matter how

8333.88 --> 8337.899
you bend space and time and make them

8335.92 --> 8340.719000000001
meet God and everything it doesn't

8337.899 --> 8343.66
matter like it's going to end the peak

8340.719 --> 8346.598999999998
will end this literally story

8343.66 --> 8348.46
development wise impossible to make it

8346.599 --> 8350.2
not end

8348.46 --> 8352.419999999998
it has to happen

8350.2 --> 8355.0
you can have it very high but it has to

8352.42 --> 8357.7
end it can't go on forever

8355.0 --> 8359.559
and if you're not willing to concede as

8357.7 --> 8361.54
a producer you're literally going to

8359.559 --> 8363.399
ruin your product and make it more silly

8361.54 --> 8364.84
and more and more silly the higher the

8363.399 --> 8367.599
peak goes

8364.84 --> 8369.28
and then people lose interest

8367.599 --> 8371.26
yep

8369.28 --> 8373.899000000001
yep like I said that's exactly what's

8371.26 --> 8375.460000000001
the mcu's problem right now exactly

8373.899 --> 8376.719
they're just trying to do the same thing

8375.46 --> 8379.0
over again yeah and it's just

8376.719 --> 8381.58
everything's just becoming Overkill

8379.0 --> 8382.96
yes right it's remember when like uh

8381.58 --> 8386.5
what is it

8382.96 --> 8388.539999999999
the the magic eye doctor what is it

8386.5 --> 8391.6
Doctor Strange yeah doctor strange it's

8388.54 --> 8394.479000000001
like whoa holy [ __ ] total hallucinog

8391.6 --> 8395.439
Jason world and super magic and it's

8394.479 --> 8397.24
like

8395.439 --> 8399.7
yeah that's now the new standard

8397.24 --> 8402.52
congratulations now you can't pull back

8399.7 --> 8405.220000000001
from that because then it will seem lame

8402.52 --> 8407.08
congratulations you got another Peak now

8405.22 --> 8408.699999999999
you have to peek it even further it has

8407.08 --> 8410.979
to become so ridiculous that people

8408.7 --> 8414.939
literally get seizures after five

8410.979 --> 8416.08
seconds of watching it in the future

8414.939 --> 8419.92
right

8416.08 --> 8423.1
right I it's yeah it's rough

8419.92 --> 8424.78
I mean and and it's just in everything

8423.1 --> 8426.52
is I mean I think that's part of what's

8424.78 --> 8429.04
going on with the strike right now the

8426.52 --> 8430.6
writers strike and everything right they

8429.04 --> 8433.060000000001
just don't have enough time to come up

8430.6 --> 8435.04
with anything creative I mean right as

8433.06 --> 8437.56
you know like you can't put a timer on

8435.04 --> 8440.140000000001
ideas you can't force it through but

8437.56 --> 8442.84
they have roughly a month at most to

8440.14 --> 8444.399
write a script and then it's good I I do

8442.84 --> 8446.26
think that a lot of scripts probably

8444.399 --> 8448.42
start as something that they fed into an

8446.26 --> 8450.04
AI bot Honestly though and then they

8448.42 --> 8453.399
have people kind of clean them up no

8450.04 --> 8455.800000000001
well what they do is do you know how

8453.399 --> 8459.22
many people write Scripts

8455.8 --> 8461.8
oh yeah there's billions of them out

8459.22 --> 8464.38
there that never see they like they get

8461.8 --> 8466.619999999999
put on the internet and literally it's

8464.38 --> 8466.619999999999
just

8467.34 --> 8472.12
here you got a script

8470.08 --> 8473.92
right because there is great

8472.12 --> 8476.08
storytelling out there that nobody's

8473.92 --> 8479.56
ever heard of and it's just they try to

8476.08 --> 8481.42
reassemble it and it works I mean and

8479.56 --> 8482.979
often it's like people come there and

8481.42 --> 8484.479
it's like I got a great script for this

8482.979 --> 8486.399
I've been working on this for like 20

8484.479 --> 8488.08
years and yeah you did a lot of things

8486.399 --> 8490.119999999999
that might change a bit

8488.08 --> 8491.439
but I mean it still works it's still a

8490.12 --> 8494.62
great script and then they like

8491.439 --> 8496.18
assimilate that for their new movie so a

8494.62 --> 8498.640000000001
lot of times the movie will still work

8496.18 --> 8500.68
because they had a great script that's

8498.64 --> 8503.92
kind of like very carefully developed

8500.68 --> 8505.84
running up to that and not just like you

8503.92 --> 8509.439
gotta have a script in one month because

8505.84 --> 8512.5
that always becomes a just a

8509.439 --> 8517.0
a padding fast that always happens

8512.5 --> 8518.56
yeah yeah I mean I I think kind of like

8517.0 --> 8521.02
what what you're saying is definitely

8518.56 --> 8523.06
true but I think that they also do feed

8521.02 --> 8525.939
in those millions of scripts that have

8523.06 --> 8527.859
fed them into an AI and because that way

8525.939 --> 8529.479000000001
they can control what kind of because it

8527.859 --> 8531.04
is always a checklist from the studio

8529.479 --> 8533.399
heads they're like we want to have

8531.04 --> 8537.1
diversity here yeah

8533.399 --> 8540.16
if they stop that dude you'd you'd have

8537.1 --> 8543.04
like a golden age of new movies

8540.16 --> 8545.08
immediately if they just stop doing that

8543.04 --> 8548.380000000001
because the technology has caught on

8545.08 --> 8551.74
like things can be put to camera and

8548.38 --> 8554.619999999999
with music now and CGI that is like

8551.74 --> 8556.899
the like the prime concentrate of

8554.62 --> 8559.979000000001
everything we longed for in the 80s and

8556.899 --> 8563.14
90s they can do that perfectly

8559.979 --> 8564.88
absolutely astoundingly perfectly but I

8563.14 --> 8567.88
just have to keep rowing it with the

8564.88 --> 8570.339999999998
stupid mind control horse [ __ ] I can't

8567.88 --> 8572.259999999998
help themselves it's like well if you

8570.34 --> 8574.18
don't do that you don't get the extra

8572.26 --> 8576.16
Millions for your movie budget or

8574.18 --> 8577.18
something I mean it almost has to be

8576.16 --> 8579.22
that

8577.18 --> 8581.56
right because why the hell would you do

8579.22 --> 8583.539999999999
it every time

8581.56 --> 8586.3
crazy it is a shame the tools are

8583.54 --> 8589.359
amazing I mean I do of course like many

8586.3 --> 8591.819
people feel that the CGI aspect that

8589.359 --> 8594.34
they've gone overboard with over using

8591.819 --> 8596.319
it I do think right around I mean

8594.34 --> 8598.06
because it's so cheap

8596.319 --> 8600.46
Lord of the Rings is a great example

8598.06 --> 8602.56
like that was a good move like they used

8600.46 --> 8605.08
practical effects they supplemented with

8602.56 --> 8608.979
CGI it still looks right today yeah the

8605.08 --> 8611.7
C the CGI should always be a thing that

8608.979 --> 8614.619999999999
you don't realize it's CGI to like

8611.7 --> 8616.78
lessen the risks of a stunt for example

8614.62 --> 8620.740000000002
and then nobody ever sees it and it's

8616.78 --> 8622.78
like whoa right and Sarah and nobody

8620.74 --> 8625.66
will it will never decrease like

8622.78 --> 8628.0
Terminator 2 is full of that stuff yes

8625.66 --> 8630.939
and and there is like obvious CGI with

8628.0 --> 8633.04
like the T-1000 and so endlessly studied

8630.939 --> 8635.380000000001
on the internet and you can always find

8633.04 --> 8637.84
somebody's studying that that movie on

8635.38 --> 8640.3
the internet on YouTube right but

8637.84 --> 8641.859
there's also just parts that are CGI

8640.3 --> 8644.438999999998
that you don't know

8641.859 --> 8646.54
right and those are like the best

8644.439 --> 8649.78
because nobody ever sees that that is

8646.54 --> 8651.76
CGI because the T1000 really stands out

8649.78 --> 8654.34
for its good CGI and then you don't even

8651.76 --> 8657.16
notice the parts that they are doing CGI

8654.34 --> 8659.68
because it's not shiny and standing out

8657.16 --> 8661.479
brilliant that's the way to do it like

8659.68 --> 8663.880000000001
if you're gonna have CGI then have

8661.479 --> 8665.619999999999
something that really stands out as CGI

8663.88 --> 8669.339999999998
but it's so good

8665.62 --> 8671.979000000001
that its presence is so shiny and

8669.34 --> 8674.74
distracting that you don't see the other

8671.979 --> 8676.06
CGI that's more hidden it's a perfect

8674.74 --> 8678.699999999999
way to do it

8676.06 --> 8680.88
and the perfect way to ruin it is to

8678.7 --> 8685.439
have like a really stupid

8680.88 --> 8685.438999999998
spielbergian alien to do that

8685.66 --> 8690.46
because then it's just annoying guys

8687.939 --> 8692.800000000001
Jurassic Park is a perfect

8690.46 --> 8695.319
yeah exactly because that's still

8692.8 --> 8697.96
practical props for the up close shots

8695.319 --> 8701.199999999999
and that's like perfect you have to up

8697.96 --> 8704.14
close real stuff really moving

8701.2 --> 8705.880000000001
really pushing somebody over and then

8704.14 --> 8708.099999999999
you do a little bit more distance shot

8705.88 --> 8709.599999999999
and they can just CGI it up for the

8708.1 --> 8712.06
actions perfect

8709.6 --> 8713.800000000001
distance and darkness like the T-Rex

8712.06 --> 8715.6
scene takes place in the rain and all

8713.8 --> 8718.06
that kind of when he's escaping from the

8715.6 --> 8720.640000000001
yeah but if you're gonna have real ring

8718.06 --> 8722.8
you don't want to do that CGI you want a

8720.64 --> 8724.539999999999
plastic thing that's standing there on

8722.8 --> 8726.039999999999
which you're gonna drop real rain and

8724.54 --> 8729.580000000002
that makes it real

8726.04 --> 8732.28
right for that moment if that was CGI

8729.58 --> 8734.8
everybody would see like uh

8732.28 --> 8736.300000000001
all right I mean I just don't even know

8734.8 --> 8738.099999999999
if we'll ever get to the point where

8736.3 --> 8740.74
somebody's standing in front of a green

8738.1 --> 8743.92
screen like in bright light even looks

8740.74 --> 8746.68
natural like I watched the what was it

8743.92 --> 8749.56
that play the latest Ant-Man movie yeah

8746.68 --> 8751.479000000001
[Music]

8749.56 --> 8753.699999999999
but that's because of all over Reliance

8751.479 --> 8755.858999999999
on CDI they basically cut Corners with

8753.7 --> 8758.439
CGI and it's always palpable in the end

8755.859 --> 8760.84
if you want to see a good application of

8758.439 --> 8764.56
real heavy detect CGI

8760.84 --> 8767.859
watch 1917. I watched that recently it's

8764.56 --> 8769.96
a movie that is about World War One like

8767.859 --> 8771.7
based on somebody's literal testimony

8769.96 --> 8773.938999999998
that did that it's basically the guy

8771.7 --> 8776.319000000001
that's the main character in the movie

8773.939 --> 8778.479000000001
wrote that story and they made this

8776.319 --> 8782.019999999999
movie out of it and it has singular

8778.479 --> 8784.24
shots that like last five minutes

8782.02 --> 8786.399000000001
of him just walking walking talking

8784.24 --> 8787.96
camera goes around them they keep

8786.399 --> 8790.479
walking you see everything they walk

8787.96 --> 8792.64
past and all the death and barbed wire

8790.479 --> 8796.0
and craters and the most horrendous

8792.64 --> 8798.039999999999
scenes and it just keeps on going but it

8796.0 --> 8801.399
must be CDI

8798.04 --> 8804.580000000002
but it's so natural how they did it that

8801.399 --> 8806.858999999999
they can have impossible shots

8804.58 --> 8808.72
and just you don't really see that it's

8806.859 --> 8811.42
an impossible shot you're just really

8808.72 --> 8813.819
impressed by how real it all looks it's

8811.42 --> 8817.899
like they kept they keep walking and

8813.819 --> 8820.66
then you realize this must all be CGI

8817.899 --> 8822.939
but it's kind of mundane

8820.66 --> 8825.46
and it just like so convincing that it's

8822.939 --> 8827.26
real it is super impressed check that

8825.46 --> 8830.259999999998
movie out if you're interested in CGI

8827.26 --> 8833.02
sub that one is like magical

8830.26 --> 8836.74
sure is that 19 is that relatively

8833.02 --> 8838.26
recent yes okay 1917.

8836.74 --> 8841.319
it's on Netflix

8838.26 --> 8844.12
I I miss hearing you

8841.319 --> 8846.819
1917. of course yes like why would it be

8844.12 --> 8849.34
about World War One if it's 1970 yeah

8846.819 --> 8851.14
I'm a genius Italian now if it's 90 70

8849.34 --> 8854.5
it's going to be about the Space Program

8851.14 --> 8856.779999999999
nonsense like uh like Indiana Jones the

8854.5 --> 8858.16
new one which does take place in that

8856.78 --> 8859.359
time

8858.16 --> 8861.399
yeah

8859.359 --> 8863.2
and I still haven't gotten to that one I

8861.399 --> 8866.26
did watch the spider verse when I said I

8863.2 --> 8868.240000000002
was going to right and it was uh it's

8866.26 --> 8870.460000000001
not even a full movie it's a part two

8868.24 --> 8873.399
and there's it ended on a cliffhanger

8870.46 --> 8876.039999999999
and not very satisfying as far as that

8873.399 --> 8878.26
goes and it's just oh my gosh the

8876.04 --> 8880.720000000001
Whiplash these days in some things it's

8878.26 --> 8883.06
it's crazy the music's pumping you can't

8880.72 --> 8884.5
even barely hear the dialogue and

8883.06 --> 8886.06
everything's shaking around it's

8884.5 --> 8887.439
aggressive

8886.06 --> 8889.779999999999
like

8887.439 --> 8891.52
it's just really aggressive

8889.78 --> 8893.08
right and then I look over and I'm

8891.52 --> 8895.18
watching my son and he's like he's

8893.08 --> 8895.899
driving to it he loves it I'm like oh

8895.18 --> 8898.68
boy

8895.899 --> 8898.68
oh boy

8899.08 --> 8904.06
yeah it's all about getting used to it

8902.08 --> 8908.439
though

8904.06 --> 8911.26
I mean you had really insane manga an

8908.439 --> 8912.819
anime like even in the 90s that if you

8911.26 --> 8914.64
would see that now you'd still be

8912.819 --> 8917.08
freaked out

8914.64 --> 8918.76
and it's all a matter of whether you

8917.08 --> 8920.56
allow yourself to get used to that

8918.76 --> 8922.479
because if you then like I'm into this

8920.56 --> 8924.519999999999
well you're gonna get used to that

8922.479 --> 8926.38
that sounds a little bit like how the

8924.52 --> 8929.26
Frog gets used to the boiling water that

8926.38 --> 8931.539999999999
I mean exactly

8929.26 --> 8934.06
but it is dangerous I mean

8931.54 --> 8937.060000000001
I'm gonna go a bit of Owen Benjamin lore

8934.06 --> 8938.979
here but if you go into anime and like

8937.06 --> 8943.0
especially as a team you get really into

8938.979 --> 8945.22
that well guess what you're gonna become

8943.0 --> 8947.62
gay

8945.22 --> 8950.5
literally because it is literally like

8947.62 --> 8952.84
watching porn sometimes it's not even

8950.5 --> 8955.0
that they overtly show porn it's just

8952.84 --> 8957.7
that they have they play on these

8955.0 --> 8961.18
instincts so much

8957.7 --> 8962.62
all the time all the time trying to play

8961.18 --> 8965.58
with your

8962.62 --> 8968.5
yeah with your nether regions

8965.58 --> 8970.6
just even like subconscious they just

8968.5 --> 8972.819
always have that focus in like all those

8970.6 --> 8975.52
series

8972.819 --> 8978.58
yeah I mean I think you become gay you

8975.52 --> 8980.62
become sex addicted from watching anime

8978.58 --> 8982.18
it is true and you don't even have to

8980.62 --> 8983.5
just want to watch hentai it just

8982.18 --> 8986.08
happens

8983.5 --> 8988.42
right and it's just kind of the effects

8986.08 --> 8991.06
Amplified because I mean I I'd argue

8988.42 --> 8993.399
that almost you'd find a similar sort of

8991.06 --> 8997.3
thing and going back to the Looney Tunes

8993.399 --> 8998.858999999999
even Bugs Bunny there's Bugs Bunny's a

8997.3 --> 9003.72
little bit uh

8998.859 --> 9006.0
on the side yeah well that's well that's

9003.72 --> 9008.46
just the Grapplers cartoons right so

9006.0 --> 9011.96
they do a lot of naughty stuff in there

9008.46 --> 9011.96
lots of naughty stuff

9012.42 --> 9017.16
right I eat it then in the 90s too they

9014.76 --> 9019.439
were people actually started they were

9017.16 --> 9020.76
mad at SpongeBob because and I'll tell

9019.439 --> 9024.0
you there are a lot of butts on

9020.76 --> 9026.819
SpongeBob there's a lot of butts

9024.0 --> 9029.28
going back for it right and Stimpy like

9026.819 --> 9031.56
practice every every cartoon Really and

9029.28 --> 9034.140000000001
ideally yeah since the 90s a little bit

9031.56 --> 9035.939
edgier is is the idea because the kids

9034.14 --> 9037.14
like it if it's a little bit edgy or

9035.939 --> 9039.960000000001
they feel like they're getting away with

9037.14 --> 9042.599999999999
something so that's the perfect venue to

9039.96 --> 9044.339999999998
kind of sneak in these little things and

9042.6 --> 9046.5
again I I don't even know how blatant

9044.34 --> 9049.08
the sneaking is sometimes it's more a

9046.5 --> 9051.12
reflection often of the people producing

9049.08 --> 9053.24
it you know almost inadvertently at

9051.12 --> 9053.240000000002
times

9053.58 --> 9059.3
right oh

9056.28 --> 9059.300000000001
I'm melting

9059.54 --> 9064.02
I bet yeah I'm glad our weather finally

9062.22 --> 9066.539999999999
broke here we were supposed to have rain

9064.02 --> 9069.479000000001
essentially for the next week and that's

9066.54 --> 9072.359
helped out a lot it is crazy that our

9069.479 --> 9073.979
our warmest days of the year and for the

9072.359 --> 9078.24
I'm in the east coast of the United

9073.979 --> 9080.46
States PA for anybody listening but uh

9078.24 --> 9082.68
yeah it's we we basically had our

9080.46 --> 9084.358999999999
hottest days of the year the last two uh

9082.68 --> 9086.58
not yesterday so much but the last two

9084.359 --> 9089.04
days before that which is just wild

9086.58 --> 9091.68
because I remember always growing up in

9089.04 --> 9093.960000000001
around the same area my dad would always

9091.68 --> 9096.12
say September 1st the light bulb goes

9093.96 --> 9097.858999999999
off and that used to be the case up

9096.12 --> 9101.060000000001
until I'd say the last

9097.859 --> 9101.06
five ten years

9101.46 --> 9107.339999999998
it does give some Credence to me about

9103.8 --> 9108.858999999999
uh just time shifting a little bit as

9107.34 --> 9112.5
far as like

9108.859 --> 9116.58
365 day calendar to the 360 day calendar

9112.5 --> 9118.62
maybe like what what where what

9116.58 --> 9121.26
as far well I mean think about it if you

9118.62 --> 9124.380000000001
had a 360 day calendar right instead of

9121.26 --> 9128.28
a 365 day calendar you'd eventually your

9124.38 --> 9130.92
Seasons would would shift right yeah but

9128.28 --> 9133.2
yeah it's not logical there should be 13

9130.92 --> 9136.2
months because that's literally how long

9133.2 --> 9139.2
a month lasts and if you take 13 months

9136.2 --> 9142.439
it every month is 28 days and it fits

9139.2 --> 9144.240000000002
perfectly yes and and yeah I'm inclined

9142.439 --> 9146.34
to agree with that way I'm looking at it

9144.24 --> 9148.74
but I'm just saying in general that it

9146.34 --> 9151.859
does seem like to me that we're kind of

9148.74 --> 9154.699999999999
our our seasons are I mean up here we

9151.859 --> 9156.62
used to have winter from practically

9154.7 --> 9159.060000000001
mid-november to

9156.62 --> 9160.979000000001
April and now it seems like winter

9159.06 --> 9163.68
doesn't even start until almost January

9160.979 --> 9165.84
1st which does make it seem like there's

9163.68 --> 9168.24
been a bit of a shift with when the

9165.84 --> 9172.02
seasons happen that is true because the

9168.24 --> 9174.119999999999
summer is now always into September I

9172.02 --> 9177.24
call September the after summer

9174.12 --> 9179.399000000001
right but then again usually or

9177.24 --> 9181.619999999999
sometimes mostly in May it's already

9179.399 --> 9183.84
like summer anyway

9181.62 --> 9186.240000000002
but that could just like it's spring and

9183.84 --> 9189.6
spring can get pretty warm here

9186.24 --> 9192.979
right it's like a pre-summer so

9189.6 --> 9195.359
but I mean yeah how it works changes

9192.979 --> 9198.119999999999
climate change

9195.359 --> 9201.6
no well yeah but I mean that's just

9198.12 --> 9203.76
cyclical it's just the weather the

9201.6 --> 9206.16
weather Cycles change the sun output

9203.76 --> 9208.26
does actually change over like there's

9206.16 --> 9209.88
this oscillation with what comes out of

9208.26 --> 9212.7
the Sun

9209.88 --> 9215.519999999999
I just always like within the standard

9212.7 --> 9218.7
model of of history and time and the

9215.52 --> 9220.859
Earth is 4.3 billion years et cetera et

9218.7 --> 9223.740000000002
cetera that even operating within that

9220.859 --> 9225.359
that thought that then climatologists

9223.74 --> 9227.22
will come and say look at the weather

9225.359 --> 9228.899000000001
look at the change right now when you're

9227.22 --> 9233.039999999999
talking about data that goes back to

9228.899 --> 9234.979
like 1850 at Best in a lot of cases at

9233.04 --> 9238.140000000001
least like really detailed information

9234.979 --> 9240.899
and so like what percentage of a sample

9238.14 --> 9243.119999999999
size would that be versus the allegedly

9240.899 --> 9244.92
billions of years of existence that you

9243.12 --> 9246.359
have there what what what good

9244.92 --> 9248.28
information Could you actually derive

9246.359 --> 9250.02
from that it's it's again another

9248.28 --> 9251.880000000001
concept that's self-defeating on its

9250.02 --> 9254.04
face yeah but it's the point is is that

9251.88 --> 9256.5
climate change what it really makes it

9254.04 --> 9260.34
the way it is what makes it a Marxist

9256.5 --> 9262.8
tool is that it it blames industry and

9260.34 --> 9266.04
it blames industry and and that sort of

9262.8 --> 9268.56
thing on the change while industry

9266.04 --> 9270.359
really only started to come about around

9268.56 --> 9273.06
the 1800s

9270.359 --> 9275.460000000001
well the industrialization but hey

9273.06 --> 9276.66
before that right before that the

9275.46 --> 9278.938999999998
Renaissance

9276.66 --> 9281.52
there was a record called

9278.939 --> 9283.62
like the oceans around the Netherlands

9281.52 --> 9288.24
were frozen there's a lot of paintings

9283.62 --> 9291.060000000001
of that right and before that there was

9288.24 --> 9292.74
the hottest period still in in on record

9291.06 --> 9294.84
in history

9292.74 --> 9297.3
yeah no industry

9294.84 --> 9299.399
there's no industry so whatever happens

9297.3 --> 9301.38
yeah the temperature can go really up

9299.399 --> 9305.279999999999
and really down and there's this stuff

9301.38 --> 9307.38
but it has absolutely nothing to do with

9305.28 --> 9310.08
human industry

9307.38 --> 9312.3
at all right because the human industry

9310.08 --> 9314.64
allegedly in medieval times was record

9312.3 --> 9317.539999999999
low

9314.64 --> 9319.8
right well I mean and and

9317.54 --> 9321.899000000001
there's obviously there's been cold

9319.8 --> 9324.72
fires that that have been burning

9321.899 --> 9326.519999999999
naturally for I mean allegedly tens of

9324.72 --> 9328.92
thousands if not hundreds of thousands

9326.52 --> 9330.84
of millions of years they say so like

9328.92 --> 9334.439
that would seem to create a problem yeah

9330.84 --> 9336.6
but an oil oil it's like if if we

9334.439 --> 9338.819
wouldn't use oil we would just have tar

9336.6 --> 9341.7
pits everywhere again

9338.819 --> 9343.859
because it just keeps coming

9341.7 --> 9346.319000000001
it's like you need like we need to

9343.859 --> 9348.78
almost like use it so it's not in the

9346.319 --> 9351.0
way because it will keep reproducing

9348.78 --> 9352.74
that's why in ancient times it just had

9351.0 --> 9354.359
Tar Pits everywhere and hey they use the

9352.74 --> 9356.88
tool for lamp oil

9354.359 --> 9358.2
it's like just dip your torch in the tar

9356.88 --> 9359.759999999998
pit

9358.2 --> 9362.04
that's it

9359.76 --> 9364.439
yeah again in the in the part of PA that

9362.04 --> 9366.18
that I'm in right now this is one of the

9364.439 --> 9369.300000000001
earliest places where they discovered

9366.18 --> 9371.76
oil in North America allegedly because I

9369.3 --> 9373.319
say with an asterisk because I've been

9371.76 --> 9375.42
to several places in this country that

9373.319 --> 9377.039999999999
try to make the same claim but anyway

9375.42 --> 9379.319
there's the accounts from the early

9377.04 --> 9381.54
people coming along the the Allegheny

9379.319 --> 9384.42
River and the oil you know was just

9381.54 --> 9387.78
floating free freely down it right just

9384.42 --> 9390.74
lamp oil before we had gasoline

9387.78 --> 9393.18
uh from chemical refinement of raw oil

9390.74 --> 9395.399
it would just be lamb oil they would

9393.18 --> 9398.24
just make lamb oil it was very easy and

9395.399 --> 9401.18
it's everywhere lamp oil was standard

9398.24 --> 9404.34
like all throughout the world

9401.18 --> 9407.34
arguably even in antiquity

9404.34 --> 9408.84
so it's been used forever

9407.34 --> 9413.12
yes

9408.84 --> 9415.74
and yeah whales yeah maybe

9413.12 --> 9418.92
now somebody in chat said Wales yeah

9415.74 --> 9420.42
they also used whales for oil especially

9418.92 --> 9422.22
in the Industrial Age which was

9420.42 --> 9424.26
horrendous

9422.22 --> 9426.179999999998
that's why we barely have whales anymore

9424.26 --> 9427.14
it used to be all filled up with whales

9426.18 --> 9429.6
everywhere

9427.14 --> 9432.358999999999
but I mean that's only because it was

9429.6 --> 9434.939
like World War Industry they need more

9432.359 --> 9437.52
than they have now there's just so much

9434.939 --> 9439.380000000001
oil everywhere that's you'd never need

9437.52 --> 9441.66
any other source of oil

9439.38 --> 9444.179999999998
it's funny though whale oil bringing

9441.66 --> 9446.939
that up because uh when I went on this

9444.18 --> 9449.880000000001
little tour of uh the place is called

9446.939 --> 9453.42
pet hole PA it's an abandoned ancient

9449.88 --> 9455.819
goat ghost ghost town but the the guy uh

9453.42 --> 9457.92
the tour guide there was going on about

9455.819 --> 9460.199999999999
whale oil for a bit about how they were

9457.92 --> 9462.479
using that before the petroleum and he

9460.2 --> 9466.08
says but actually whale oil is still

9462.479 --> 9468.24
used in the outer space because it it

9466.08 --> 9472.1
you know it you can use it in the vacuum

9468.24 --> 9475.08
is what he was trying to Proclaim yeah

9472.1 --> 9477.06
okay that reminds me of that South Park

9475.08 --> 9479.46
episode where they basically launched

9477.06 --> 9482.46
that whale to the Moon

9479.46 --> 9484.319
the [ __ ] remember that

9482.46 --> 9486.0
yeah

9484.319 --> 9488.64
I haven't watched South Park in a long

9486.0 --> 9490.8
time but I I still love the the some of

9488.64 --> 9492.96
the classic episodes I just remember all

9490.8 --> 9496.14
of it it's like yeah I don't watch it

9492.96 --> 9497.819
regularly the newer seasons are kind of

9496.14 --> 9500.099999999999
lame they're just like trying to make

9497.819 --> 9502.08
fun of sjw [ __ ] like it's just not

9500.1 --> 9505.92
working really it's

9502.08 --> 9507.539999999999
but before that they've made so many

9505.92 --> 9510.72
jokes it's like they covered everything

9507.54 --> 9511.979000000001
and it's pretty amazing to look back

9510.72 --> 9514.14
still

9511.979 --> 9516.899
like if you watched like the OC from

9514.14 --> 9519.858999999999
season two to like season 15 you're

9516.899 --> 9522.899
gonna be like whoa what the [ __ ]

9519.859 --> 9525.18
they actually went there and I didn't

9522.899 --> 9528.42
even notice at the time

9525.18 --> 9530.399
yeah well amazing it kind of shows the

9528.42 --> 9533.399
culture shift too over the last two

9530.399 --> 9535.56
decades right I ain't heck you can The

9533.399 --> 9538.26
Simpsons illustrates that pretty pretty

9535.56 --> 9541.1
well too I haven't really followed the

9538.26 --> 9543.899
Simpsons I don't know

9541.1 --> 9546.06
since like season five so I don't really

9543.899 --> 9547.92
know I get to hear about it through the

9546.06 --> 9549.96
internet of course I'm like oh look at

9547.92 --> 9552.72
the Seth alone and oh

9549.96 --> 9554.279999999999
predicted that what funny the more funny

9552.72 --> 9556.5
one is that

9554.28 --> 9558.960000000001
that The Simpsons basically play around

9556.5 --> 9560.7
with that nuclear material is probably

9558.96 --> 9563.88
not dangerous since they have Homer

9560.7 --> 9567.240000000002
Simpson a hall run around in his back

9563.88 --> 9569.31
pocket in every intro right right yeah

9567.24 --> 9572.3
that's a good that sort of stuff

9569.31 --> 9575.22
[Music]

9572.3 --> 9577.679999999998
swimming in the Vats but yeah I kept up

9575.22 --> 9579.199999999999
with The Simpsons for quite a while and

9577.68 --> 9581.939
unfortunately

9579.2 --> 9585.720000000001
to each their own you know I mean

9581.939 --> 9588.84
it never really got bad per se it got

9585.72 --> 9592.08
very mediocre like loses his Edge pretty

9588.84 --> 9593.52
quickly on but uh I did give up watching

9592.08 --> 9595.439
it though when they when they changed

9593.52 --> 9597.0
the voice actors because apparently you

9595.439 --> 9600.78
can't play somebody that isn't your own

9597.0 --> 9602.7
color like I just I'm I'm sorry at that

9600.78 --> 9606.78
point yeah they had to replace they

9602.7 --> 9609.960000000001
replaced like Dr Hibbert and uh uh Apu

9606.78 --> 9614.16
and and pretty much anybody of of color

9609.96 --> 9615.3
they they change to a appropriate voice

9614.16 --> 9617.88
actor

9615.3 --> 9620.46
well screw them I'm doing I'm doing

9617.88 --> 9623.22
Indian voice every day whenever I feel

9620.46 --> 9625.74
like it I'm very good at it

9623.22 --> 9628.019999999999
right I mean and screw you hey I can't

9625.74 --> 9629.52
even look like an Indian so who cares

9628.02 --> 9631.439
it's like yeah

9629.52 --> 9633.479000000001
if you never knew me you could think

9631.439 --> 9635.460000000001
that could be an Indian guy

9633.479 --> 9638.22
and I can talk like an Indian very well

9635.46 --> 9640.438999999998
just because I'm not brown doesn't mean

9638.22 --> 9643.019999999999
that I couldn't not be Indian I very

9640.439 --> 9645.899
well can be I know how to use the

9643.02 --> 9648.18
inflections that are so typical

9645.899 --> 9650.96
you know exactly I mean you sound better

9648.18 --> 9650.960000000001
than a real Indian

9652.26 --> 9657.300000000001
well but yeah no it's ridiculous and I

9655.38 --> 9659.099999999999
mean I think it loses track of and

9657.3 --> 9661.56
that's you could say this about so many

9659.1 --> 9663.42
things that go on now is it just loses

9661.56 --> 9664.619999999999
trap of what the point was that you were

9663.42 --> 9668.1
trying to accomplish in the first place

9664.62 --> 9670.439
I mean having fun like white actors

9668.1 --> 9671.76
doing blackface back in the day because

9670.439 --> 9674.58
you aren't going to hire a black person

9671.76 --> 9678.18
I agree that's probably not great like

9674.58 --> 9679.92
but that's not what's going on in in the

9678.18 --> 9681.84
modern era and a lot of these issues

9679.92 --> 9685.08
were solved decades ago and we're just

9681.84 --> 9688.979
relitigating them in the most obtuse and

9685.08 --> 9691.68
Broad ways possible like

9688.979 --> 9692.76
and that's a big issue with our culture

9691.68 --> 9696.12
right now

9692.76 --> 9698.64
right it's ridiculous I mean it's in

9696.12 --> 9701.220000000001
cartoons anything should be possible

9698.64 --> 9703.68
sure right if they're on camera that's

9701.22 --> 9706.019999999999
another thing yeah then it's like that

9703.68 --> 9708.380000000001
well unless it's on purpose like with

9706.02 --> 9711.960000000001
that one movie where Robert Downey Jr

9708.38 --> 9714.479
plays an actor that plays their black

9711.96 --> 9716.399
that was really funny in that but only

9714.479 --> 9718.38
because of that really that was just

9716.399 --> 9719.76
like a weird weird curiosity that I

9718.38 --> 9721.858999999999
thought was really funny

9719.76 --> 9724.399
but it's like on purpose

9721.859 --> 9726.08
because it's like not like logically

9724.399 --> 9729.68
inappropriate

9726.08 --> 9732.479
right right it's like then it's funny

9729.68 --> 9734.939
but for for cartoons like what the hell

9732.479 --> 9738.479
what are you whining about right

9734.939 --> 9741.12
right I mean especially too when it's

9738.479 --> 9743.039999999999
such iconic voices and apparently like

9741.12 --> 9744.84
again I never even started watching the

9743.04 --> 9747.720000000001
season they changed it apparently the

9744.84 --> 9749.399
new voices aren't even close and like I

9747.72 --> 9751.399
mean I have a problem when Kermit the

9749.399 --> 9753.779999999999
Frog doesn't sound like Kermit the Frog

9751.399 --> 9755.819
whoever plays Kermit the Frog now is

9753.78 --> 9757.800000000001
terrible by the way just absolutely

9755.819 --> 9760.68
awful I did I didn't know they were

9757.8 --> 9762.899
still doing stuff oh yeah they they no

9760.68 --> 9765.78
they got some moves right

9762.899 --> 9767.939
all this goes on in perpetuity yeah I

9765.78 --> 9769.92
guess

9767.939 --> 9772.979000000001
but I mean yeah that

9769.92 --> 9775.26
voice acting is really important and and

9772.979 --> 9777.24
so is music and if they keep ruining it

9775.26 --> 9779.58
then yeah I mean

9777.24 --> 9781.56
it's all that it's all gonna cost them

9779.58 --> 9783.6
money you know the thing that they want

9781.56 --> 9785.46
so much right

9783.6 --> 9787.74
so I'm just wondering like how long

9785.46 --> 9790.08
before they're just gonna like maybe

9787.74 --> 9791.699999999999
we're just not gonna do any of that and

9790.08 --> 9793.74
we're just gonna focus on the product

9791.7 --> 9796.02
and then yeah there might be a lot of

9793.74 --> 9798.479
complaining and then oh we might not

9796.02 --> 9800.939
even get like the huge mega Corporation

9798.479 --> 9802.858999999999
spreading it for us and well if you just

9800.939 --> 9805.64
spread it yourself

9802.859 --> 9808.800000000001
is gonna like attract record attention

9805.64 --> 9811.26
right like specifically because of this

9808.8 --> 9814.38
like wow a Hollywood person made a movie

9811.26 --> 9817.02
and it wasn't PC and now internally

9814.38 --> 9818.64
Hollywood is like blockading it they

9817.02 --> 9821.880000000001
don't want it to get out and they're

9818.64 --> 9824.819
basically using alternative sources to

9821.88 --> 9827.699999999999
get it out well that gets record box

9824.819 --> 9829.819
office situations like that same [ __ ]

9827.7 --> 9832.5
happened with that

9829.819 --> 9834.96
yeah exactly and it wasn't even that

9832.5 --> 9836.16
good I heard right I haven't actually

9834.96 --> 9838.919999999998
seen it

9836.16 --> 9840.84
it was like a bit over it was corny it's

9838.92 --> 9844.08
like over the top corny in a way it's

9840.84 --> 9847.14
like too much too like oh we're such a

9844.08 --> 9849.38
hero like but I mean just because they

9847.14 --> 9852.199999999999
did that it's like people that are like

9849.38 --> 9854.938999999998
something that woke up

9852.2 --> 9858.479000000001
like quickly through our entire life

9854.939 --> 9860.880000000001
saving at it right that happens

9858.479 --> 9862.56
I I think I think the studios were super

9860.88 --> 9864.899
jealous that they didn't think of doing

9862.56 --> 9868.92
the whole QR code Pay It Forward ticket

9864.899 --> 9871.619999999999
idea before it they did it too okay

9868.92 --> 9873.12
when I read how how bad that is how

9871.62 --> 9876.479000000001
that's flubbing the note like that just

9873.12 --> 9879.240000000002
reads such jealousy to me

9876.479 --> 9882.06
right it's so petty I mean you are

9879.24 --> 9883.56
literally cutting logically from the

9882.06 --> 9885.18
professional perspective into the

9883.56 --> 9888.479
quality of your product

9885.18 --> 9891.720000000001
to try to achieve some

9888.479 --> 9893.039999999999
some ideas some social engineering and

9891.72 --> 9895.8
then you're gonna complain about

9893.04 --> 9897.960000000001
somebody not doing that having a massive

9895.8 --> 9901.38
success I mean

9897.96 --> 9903.779999999999
projection hello you're doing that you

9901.38 --> 9906.06
should know that that's going to be the

9903.78 --> 9909.12
price because you're re-prioritizing

9906.06 --> 9911.34
quality and thus popularity

9909.12 --> 9914.939
yeah putting it beneath your stupid

9911.34 --> 9918.0
little virtue signaling nonsense right

9914.939 --> 9918.960000000001
what are you complaining about you did

9918.0 --> 9920.16
that

9918.96 --> 9923.22
you know

9920.16 --> 9925.619999999999
right and obviously all media is social

9923.22 --> 9928.8
engineering too to a certain degree I

9925.62 --> 9931.319000000001
mean all mass media I'd say but uh I'd

9928.8 --> 9933.84
also say that I just think a lot of

9931.319 --> 9936.0
times the studios with how they're

9933.84 --> 9938.460000000001
trying to do this virtue signaling they

9936.0 --> 9940.56
have litter they aren't collect data

9938.46 --> 9942.539999999999
properly in this air or analyzing it

9940.56 --> 9945.18
properly I think that they honestly

9942.54 --> 9947.28
scrape social media and they think that

9945.18 --> 9949.02
this is a reflection of reality and they

9947.28 --> 9951.66
run into the same problem that you have

9949.02 --> 9953.880000000001
with like the Trump phenomenon over here

9951.66 --> 9955.56
where his where his polling didn't

9953.88 --> 9957.66
actually end up reflecting the results

9955.56 --> 9959.76
like some of it's probably suppression

9957.66 --> 9961.92
but some of it's I think a lot of it's

9959.76 --> 9964.02
really bad methodology and I think

9961.92 --> 9966.359
studios are starting to realize this now

9964.02 --> 9967.979000000001
but it always takes so long for these

9966.359 --> 9969.960000000001
huge organizations to change direction

9967.979 --> 9971.399
that like we probably won't see the

9969.96 --> 9973.08
results of that until the end of this

9971.399 --> 9975.599999999999
decade

9973.08 --> 9978.539999999999
right because they're so big and then

9975.6 --> 9980.52
it's very hard to actually once they

9978.54 --> 9984.54
make decisions about how to do things

9980.52 --> 9986.42
it's very tiresome and long-winded to

9984.54 --> 9989.460000000001
change it back

9986.42 --> 9991.68
it's always the bigger the company the

9989.46 --> 9993.0
harder it is to undo changes basically

9991.68 --> 9995.12
yeah

9993.0 --> 9998.28
yeah and they really screwed up with

9995.12 --> 10000.439
yeah because everybody went all in like

9998.28 --> 10003.439
a bunch of [ __ ] retards

10000.439 --> 10006.14
it's like yeah now you're good like oh

10003.439 --> 10008.54
thanks you literally just guaranteed the

10006.14 --> 10011.0
total Destruction of all economy by

10008.54 --> 10013.819000000001
doing that you're [ __ ] retards I hope

10011.0 --> 10014.92
you all get stabbed in an alley for that

10013.819 --> 10016.76
[ __ ]

10014.92 --> 10018.74
unfortunately and it really is

10016.76 --> 10020.42
inexcusable except you get lost in your

10018.74 --> 10021.74
own [ __ ] because like I mean when

10020.42 --> 10025.76
you even when you looked at Netflix

10021.74 --> 10027.8
Netflix was not making money for a long

10025.76 --> 10029.84
time relative to what they were dumping

10027.8 --> 10031.819
in especially too but they were doing it

10029.84 --> 10035.12
to get you know Market Supremacy the

10031.819 --> 10037.519999999999
same way that anything Works Uber for

10035.12 --> 10038.84
instance was again I don't even know if

10037.52 --> 10040.04
half these things are still turning a

10038.84 --> 10041.54
profit but they're just trying to run

10040.04 --> 10043.6
everybody out into the market and then

10041.54 --> 10046.76
they can jack prices but

10043.6 --> 10048.5
the problem is it's not it's just not a

10046.76 --> 10050.24
sustainable model of streaming it isn't

10048.5 --> 10052.7
you can't pay eight dollars a month and

10050.24 --> 10055.399
then go and spend a hundred million

10052.7 --> 10058.28
dollars per original project then that

10055.399 --> 10060.38
will never work out right there

10058.28 --> 10062.42
right it's yeah

10060.38 --> 10065.179999999998
but I mean like when things get

10062.42 --> 10067.34
successful and then integrated into like

10065.18 --> 10069.08
entire Society getting full ads for

10067.34 --> 10072.02
acknowledgment

10069.08 --> 10073.58
everybody that that's happened to has

10072.02 --> 10077.0
gone like crazy

10073.58 --> 10079.22
like they just become megalomaniacal and

10077.0 --> 10080.6
then they ruin it somehow it it seems to

10079.22 --> 10083.358999999999
happen every time

10080.6 --> 10085.460000000001
like actually being recognized and part

10083.359 --> 10086.84
of the system really tends to [ __ ] with

10085.46 --> 10088.88
people's heads

10086.84 --> 10091.460000000001
when they're in

10088.88 --> 10093.5
yeah and it's just the nature of

10091.46 --> 10096.08
Corporations too as specifically

10093.5 --> 10098.359
publicly traded corporations because

10096.08 --> 10101.12
you're a victim of your own success you

10098.359 --> 10102.74
grow and you have to keep on growing in

10101.12 --> 10105.62
order to keep your shareholders happy

10102.74 --> 10106.699999999999
and like to and so it's an endless cycle

10105.62 --> 10109.76
and you're going to hit the wall

10106.7 --> 10112.220000000001
eventually right same issue right the

10109.76 --> 10114.380000000001
peak has to end at some point yeah

10112.22 --> 10117.74
coming back to full circle

10114.38 --> 10120.619999999999
right it's almost as if we live in a

10117.74 --> 10124.52
world where things are finite and stuff

10120.62 --> 10126.979000000001
and everything dies it's right it's a

10124.52 --> 10128.54
it's a cycle like everything is a cycle

10126.979 --> 10130.399
you always have to think as a cycle

10128.54 --> 10132.62
about yourself about your own

10130.399 --> 10134.42
progression like yeah when you're

10132.62 --> 10136.76
improving your Peaks are going to be

10134.42 --> 10139.22
better and your valleys are going to be

10136.76 --> 10142.359
more challenging and as soon as you lose

10139.22 --> 10145.76
track of that other more unwanted part

10142.359 --> 10147.2
you're gonna destroy your your long-term

10145.76 --> 10150.5
durability

10147.2 --> 10153.02
right it's like you have to know how to

10150.5 --> 10155.12
deal with the valleys you always have to

10153.02 --> 10158.24
keep that in mind how am I going to

10155.12 --> 10160.399000000001
respond during my bad times with

10158.24 --> 10162.319
whatever I'm planning to do

10160.399 --> 10163.279999999999
because if you don't you're gonna [ __ ]

10162.319 --> 10164.66
it up

10163.28 --> 10166.819000000001
right

10164.66 --> 10169.52
and you just gotta remember that you're

10166.819 --> 10171.619999999999
not Immortal essentially yeah that we're

10169.52 --> 10173.78
all gonna die everything's gonna die if

10171.62 --> 10177.26
we don't use that to ground us then we

10173.78 --> 10178.939
go around acting like dumbasses well if

10177.26 --> 10181.460000000001
you think that you can live forever

10178.939 --> 10183.56
you're just gonna get yourself killed

10181.46 --> 10185.0
right are you gonna drink a lot of baby

10183.56 --> 10186.859
blood

10185.0 --> 10189.8
well who says that that's gonna Not

10186.859 --> 10192.819
Gonna Get You self-killed yeah we're not

10189.8 --> 10192.819
built to do that

10192.92 --> 10197.74
like

10194.42 --> 10197.74
yeah I mean

10197.78 --> 10202.460000000001
at least I'm not built to do that uh no

10200.66 --> 10204.319
but we're not like well you can't

10202.46 --> 10206.358999999999
technically even drink blood because

10204.319 --> 10207.319
you're gonna throw it up again it it's

10206.359 --> 10209.66
not

10207.319 --> 10211.34
you don't assimilate that

10209.66 --> 10214.819
also there's a high amount of

10211.34 --> 10217.58
parasitical dangers that happen plus you

10214.819 --> 10220.34
get poisoned by it by the side toxins so

10217.58 --> 10222.859
the only real way like the old vampire

10220.34 --> 10225.02
Elite do it is they basically give it to

10222.859 --> 10227.24
a labyrinth who extract the specific

10225.02 --> 10228.140000000001
substances from it and then inject that

10227.24 --> 10233.08
stuff

10228.14 --> 10237.8
right and but I mean yeah it works

10233.08 --> 10239.539999999999
the long-term consequences are unknown

10237.8 --> 10242.358999999999
I'm pretty sure if you're gonna like

10239.54 --> 10245.720000000001
keep yourself artificially Young by like

10242.359 --> 10247.58
a naturally injecting young stuff that

10245.72 --> 10250.119999999999
at some point something can get really

10247.58 --> 10250.12
go wrong

10250.52 --> 10254.54
like right spontaneous monster Cancers

10253.399 --> 10255.92
and [ __ ]

10254.54 --> 10257.479000000001
yeah

10255.92 --> 10259.52
we may have already seen examples of

10257.479 --> 10261.74
that amongst famous people for sure

10259.52 --> 10263.300000000001
which by the way reminds me

10261.74 --> 10267.58
one year anniversary of Queen

10263.3 --> 10267.58
Elizabeth's death oh yeah right

10267.68 --> 10272.42
all right

10269.02 --> 10273.92
rest in peace uh yeah well I wish she

10272.42 --> 10276.74
hadn't I mean

10273.92 --> 10279.74
she's like she was great compared to

10276.74 --> 10281.66
what's left over now oh yeah she was the

10279.74 --> 10284.84
the person that literally kept that

10281.66 --> 10286.819
entire nobility together yes all her

10284.84 --> 10289.42
life because the rest is just a bunch of

10286.819 --> 10293.06
dilapidated [ __ ] retards

10289.42 --> 10295.22
she was like pretty cool

10293.06 --> 10299.359
yeah that's my wife's whale house she

10295.22 --> 10301.399
loves uh European uh dynastic families

10299.359 --> 10304.24
and all that stuff she's she could

10301.399 --> 10304.24
they're horrible

10305.24 --> 10310.58
but I get it like my stepmother also is

10308.479 --> 10313.58
like into nobility and blue blood stuff

10310.58 --> 10314.96
and all that but I mean they are really

10313.58 --> 10317.6
horrible

10314.96 --> 10320.3
right no yeah I'm

10317.6 --> 10323.12
I'm kind of I can see a little bit of

10320.3 --> 10326.24
both sides of it I mean there is there

10323.12 --> 10329.6
is a certain elements of of course these

10326.24 --> 10331.88
people weren't necessarily chosen to be

10329.6 --> 10334.220000000001
that like Elizabeth herself you know

10331.88 --> 10336.259999999998
she's kind of thrust into it by a matter

10334.22 --> 10339.019999999999
of her bloodline so how much of that

10336.26 --> 10341.42
like I can't have some empathy there but

10339.02 --> 10343.58
generally speaking the entire

10341.42 --> 10346.1
the entire system and specifically the

10343.58 --> 10347.66
families are pretty odious

10346.1 --> 10350.479000000001
yeah

10347.66 --> 10353.479
up there just straight out criminals

10350.479 --> 10356.358999999999
right like they what else is here though

10353.479 --> 10359.479
yeah no but it's like even like always

10356.359 --> 10360.62
have been like the British families like

10359.479 --> 10363.619999999999
ran

10360.62 --> 10365.660000000002
massive drug trades like that the what's

10363.62 --> 10370.939
the British nobility that like [ __ ]

10365.66 --> 10373.22
China over with all the uh heroines yeah

10370.939 --> 10376.04
and they were directly connected to

10373.22 --> 10378.92
skull and bones and like there was giant

10376.04 --> 10380.660000000002
criminal operation and the nobility was

10378.92 --> 10382.76
right in the middle of it

10380.66 --> 10384.74
yeah

10382.76 --> 10386.54
and they arguably still are I mean

10384.74 --> 10390.439
they're right in the middle of this

10386.54 --> 10392.479000000001
crazy wef agenda [ __ ] it's extremely

10390.439 --> 10395.54
shameful like I'm so embarrassed that

10392.479 --> 10398.06
like our the Dutch nobility is done that

10395.54 --> 10401.18
like because now it's like yeah this

10398.06 --> 10403.519999999999
now it can't endure now now it's Gotta

10401.18 --> 10405.939
Go like it can never they can never

10403.52 --> 10408.800000000001
recover from doing this

10405.939 --> 10412.52
it's so stupid

10408.8 --> 10414.5
all they needed to do is not do that and

10412.52 --> 10418.880000000001
they would have guaranteed their

10414.5 --> 10419.899
offspring to be nobility here for for a

10418.88 --> 10423.259999999998
century

10419.899 --> 10426.5
right but that's done now nobody wants

10423.26 --> 10429.319
them anymore they're direct traitors

10426.5 --> 10431.54
right and I mean that whole model has

10429.319 --> 10433.1
been obviously dying for quite some time

10431.54 --> 10435.92
it's actually it's actually kind of

10433.1 --> 10438.08
horrifying to think about how long it

10435.92 --> 10441.26
takes for these old control systems to

10438.08 --> 10443.359
actually fade away like they they hang

10441.26 --> 10445.819
on for dear life for centuries after

10443.359 --> 10448.76
relevance right yeah but I'm not even

10445.819 --> 10451.1
against it I'm not against like

10448.76 --> 10453.08
kings and queens

10451.1 --> 10455.479000000001
I'm not against it it's just that

10453.08 --> 10457.16
they've all become so unbelievably

10455.479 --> 10459.619999999999
corrupted

10457.16 --> 10461.84
like that they just hang with the

10459.62 --> 10463.279
dirtiest of scumbags in the world like

10461.84 --> 10466.460000000001
that's the problem

10463.279 --> 10468.62
that they don't actually stay pure

10466.46 --> 10469.819
right if they did that I bet they'd be

10468.62 --> 10472.279
great

10469.819 --> 10475.58
sure they'd be like actual spiritual

10472.279 --> 10479.24
leaders if they actually tried and not

10475.58 --> 10481.46
just hold up a an image for

10479.24 --> 10483.979
to prevent the revolution right while

10481.46 --> 10486.14
they scheme against everybody if they

10483.979 --> 10487.278999999999
just not did that and actually served

10486.14 --> 10489.08
their function they would have been

10487.279 --> 10490.76
great

10489.08 --> 10493.22
right well it goes back to what I was

10490.76 --> 10494.84
talking about with the danger of wanting

10493.22 --> 10497.72
to help everybody and thinking that you

10494.84 --> 10500.479
can there is some virtue in that but it

10497.72 --> 10503.179999999998
takes such a rare person to be able to

10500.479 --> 10506.3
to pass through the the eye of the

10503.18 --> 10507.979000000001
needle so to speak that it's it's very

10506.3 --> 10510.5
difficult and especially when then

10507.979 --> 10512.539999999999
you're just uh I don't know you're just

10510.5 --> 10514.64
doing it by bloodline I don't know there

10512.54 --> 10517.899000000001
probably isn't a better way because I

10514.64 --> 10521.119999999999
I'm almost of the opinion now that I

10517.899 --> 10523.16
sort of wish that we selected our

10521.12 --> 10524.779
leaders just through random Lottery to

10523.16 --> 10526.819
be honest

10524.779 --> 10528.859
sure you get crazy people and all the

10526.819 --> 10530.66
stupid people in there but I'm not

10528.859 --> 10533.18
certain it would be much worse than than

10530.66 --> 10535.88
the voting system is now

10533.18 --> 10539.18
what voting system right what what

10535.88 --> 10542.06
voting system yeah I mean they just

10539.18 --> 10544.58
overtly just stole it

10542.06 --> 10547.58
yeah like with wheel barrels on camera

10544.58 --> 10550.24
and everything so but I was like what

10547.58 --> 10552.439
the [ __ ] what do you mean voting system

10550.24 --> 10554.539999999999
there's just so many layers to it

10552.439 --> 10556.220000000001
because you don't even because there's

10554.54 --> 10559.52
the electronic voting issue to begin

10556.22 --> 10562.64
with and then more of what I think

10559.52 --> 10566.6
happened in like the 2020 election is

10562.64 --> 10569.539999999999
that it's it's widespread only in so

10566.6 --> 10573.08
much as it's corruption's happening and

10569.54 --> 10575.0
all these big uh voting areas and it

10573.08 --> 10577.46
really is that simple to I mean people

10575.0 --> 10579.68
have said it it's like you flipped eight

10577.46 --> 10581.72
counties across the United States and

10579.68 --> 10583.819
you flipped the entire election so it's

10581.72 --> 10587.119999999999
not even doesn't even involve that many

10583.819 --> 10590.119999999999
people being being in on it and it's not

10587.12 --> 10593.060000000001
even necessarily people like sitting

10590.12 --> 10595.04
down having a back back door meeting or

10593.06 --> 10597.8
a back room meeting backdoor meeting

10595.04 --> 10599.359
that's a different thing about it

10597.8 --> 10602.66
um but um

10599.359 --> 10604.58
yeah like I mean I think that people are

10602.66 --> 10606.8
just so I A lot of people are so

10604.58 --> 10607.88
ideologically bent and especially the

10606.8 --> 10611.84
people with the you know Trump

10607.88 --> 10613.88
derangement syndrome that they would by

10611.84 --> 10615.56
themselves want to try to do this

10613.88 --> 10617.72
without even coordinating it with

10615.56 --> 10619.278999999999
anybody else

10617.72 --> 10621.5
doing what

10619.279 --> 10623.66
just Flip Flip the vote and like like

10621.5 --> 10625.819
for instance in like Fulton County in

10623.66 --> 10627.319
Georgia yeah right so that's that's the

10625.819 --> 10630.16
place where they you know they were

10627.319 --> 10632.359
getting the the

10630.16 --> 10634.16
coolers full of votes out from

10632.359 --> 10637.220000000001
underneath the table after they had the

10634.16 --> 10639.38
people come out and that that's one of

10637.22 --> 10642.38
the strongest direct pieces of evidence

10639.38 --> 10645.14
in my opinion and right I think that's

10642.38 --> 10647.24
where Trump made a big mistake with well

10645.14 --> 10649.519999999999
a the Kraken to begin with the Kraken

10647.24 --> 10650.74
always loses so not a good not a good

10649.52 --> 10653.42
metaphor

10650.74 --> 10655.279
and like Trump's just the kind of guy

10653.42 --> 10658.22
who he throws so much [ __ ] at the wall

10655.279 --> 10659.899000000001
that I think it kind of if he would have

10658.22 --> 10661.819
stuck to one or two arguments he would

10659.899 --> 10664.24
have been much better off but that's not

10661.819 --> 10664.24
his style

10665.66 --> 10668.92
ride but I mean

10669.68 --> 10675.380000000001
there was no reason for anybody to like

10672.38 --> 10677.539999999999
like he was doing just fine it was like

10675.38 --> 10681.92
yeah operation warp speed was a giant

10677.54 --> 10684.319000000001
[ __ ] up he was acting very gay oh Pro

10681.92 --> 10688.04
gay stupid Pro gay music [ __ ] everywhere

10684.319 --> 10691.519999999999
like no stop virtue signaling to them I

10688.04 --> 10693.02
love the gays [ __ ] you yeah

10691.52 --> 10695.0
yeah get out of here that was just

10693.02 --> 10697.220000000001
annoying it felt like super annoying

10695.0 --> 10700.06
virtue sickly and I it did eventually

10697.22 --> 10703.22
lead to like yeah okay in in in

10700.06 --> 10706.819
retrospect Trump was the most gay

10703.22 --> 10708.8
president of all time right well they

10706.819 --> 10711.26
all get progressively gayer but that's

10708.8 --> 10713.24
just cynical manipulation of a of a

10711.26 --> 10716.300000000001
group right there and I think he's right

10713.24 --> 10718.88
in so much as there's definitely there's

10716.3 --> 10722.24
a difference between people that are

10718.88 --> 10724.699999999999
homosexual and the LGBT movement for

10722.24 --> 10727.58
certain and I think that started kind of

10724.7 --> 10729.140000000001
becoming a Schism within itself now I

10727.58 --> 10731.779
think Trump recognized that and he was

10729.14 --> 10733.819
trying to funnel the votes off of people

10731.779 --> 10736.939
that are not down with like the trans

10733.819 --> 10739.34
ideology right well he's a liberal an

10736.939 --> 10742.279
original one oh yeah for sure that's the

10739.34 --> 10746.18
point he even he used to be that so yeah

10742.279 --> 10748.279
he just used Republican side to make a

10746.18 --> 10750.380000000001
stand but he is literally a liberal it's

10748.279 --> 10751.460000000001
just that the Democrats aren't liberal

10750.38 --> 10754.16
anymore

10751.46 --> 10756.919999999998
yeah well they're they're just [ __ ]

10754.16 --> 10758.42
Nazis they're just communist Nazis

10756.92 --> 10761.38
crazies

10758.42 --> 10765.62
it's it's the military pharmaceutical

10761.38 --> 10768.438999999998
big Tech industrial complex that that

10765.62 --> 10771.08
really runs everything and has I mean it

10768.439 --> 10773.899
is it's super amusing to hear the

10771.08 --> 10777.8
Talking Heads like compare them to the

10773.899 --> 10779.3
ones post 911 and Iraq war and then the

10777.8 --> 10781.278999999999
positions they take now almost

10779.3 --> 10783.979
everybody's inverted from where they

10781.279 --> 10785.359
were previously it's it's crazy they

10783.979 --> 10789.14
really depend on people having

10785.359 --> 10791.359
absolutely no memory of any sort of

10789.14 --> 10793.399
reason event yeah or just not the

10791.359 --> 10795.859
ability to

10793.399 --> 10798.619999999999
to deal with all the inconsistency

10795.859 --> 10800.6
everywhere so you're just like oh well

10798.62 --> 10802.34
everything is inconsistent so we're just

10800.6 --> 10804.2
gonna go with the thing that's saying

10802.34 --> 10806.72
the right thing right now

10804.2 --> 10809.960000000001
right what we want to hear right now but

10806.72 --> 10812.119999999999
that completely makes you lose grip

10809.96 --> 10814.699999999999
because you're always going to end up

10812.12 --> 10816.740000000002
with somebody like Obama you did exactly

10814.7 --> 10819.859
the same thing said exactly the right

10816.74 --> 10823.279
things it was exactly the right things

10819.859 --> 10825.380000000001
he said like even smaller government he

10823.279 --> 10827.720000000001
said everything and then he just did

10825.38 --> 10828.619999999999
exactly the opposite as soon as he got

10827.72 --> 10831.14
in power

10828.62 --> 10834.2
and and you're always going to have that

10831.14 --> 10836.119999999999
happen every single time in some way or

10834.2 --> 10838.52
the other with Trump that happened like

10836.12 --> 10840.140000000001
the least because he did actually roll

10838.52 --> 10842.779
out a couple of things He restored it

10840.14 --> 10844.22
and that's rare because usually that

10842.779 --> 10846.62
doesn't even happen

10844.22 --> 10848.3
yep you just get somebody that says oh

10846.62 --> 10850.279
this that and they do exactly the

10848.3 --> 10851.84
opposite they never do anything they

10850.279 --> 10854.0
originally promised and they they make

10851.84 --> 10857.3
everything worse that's the norm that's

10854.0 --> 10860.54
what keeps happening and Trump was like

10857.3 --> 10864.259999999998
a bit of an exception to that but just a

10860.54 --> 10867.5
bit not a complete exception just a bit

10864.26 --> 10870.08
as I said he he the swamp is swampier

10867.5 --> 10871.64
than he thought I I think and there's

10870.08 --> 10874.479
definitely a marked difference between

10871.64 --> 10878.0
his first three years and his final year

10874.479 --> 10879.26
as far as quality of governance goes but

10878.0 --> 10882.279
I mean the writing's on the wall anyway

10879.26 --> 10884.6
he was he was hiring and appointing

10882.279 --> 10886.76
questionable people from Jump Street

10884.6 --> 10888.979000000001
yeah but

10886.76 --> 10891.5
what can you do like

10888.979 --> 10892.699999999999
I don't know what you can do well you

10891.5 --> 10896.3
could do better

10892.7 --> 10898.52
yeah that'd be nice like hey like yeah

10896.3 --> 10901.64
he's a not so obvious establishment guy

10898.52 --> 10904.640000000001
but I'm like okay well

10901.64 --> 10905.96
I don't actually think Shiva can win

10904.64 --> 10907.479
although that would be really cool

10905.96 --> 10910.339999999998
because then everything could change

10907.479 --> 10913.099999999999
yeah but at least like

10910.34 --> 10915.26
I'd like to sort of like if it's gonna

10913.1 --> 10918.2
happen I'd like to see Trump actually

10915.26 --> 10920.66
just like do it right this time and not

10918.2 --> 10922.220000000001
perfect but at least like not make the

10920.66 --> 10923.84
same stupid mistakes he did the previous

10922.22 --> 10926.539999999999
time right

10923.84 --> 10928.819
and then just see if it's still worth it

10926.54 --> 10931.460000000001
I mean heck I think him winning is a

10928.819 --> 10932.72
pipe dream too at this point like it it

10931.46 --> 10935.479
is really

10932.72 --> 10936.46
it's amazing to me that the Republican

10935.479 --> 10939.5
party

10936.46 --> 10942.858999999999
wants to to back like if you actually

10939.5 --> 10945.319
look at his he he always overestimates

10942.859 --> 10948.56
it but he did not really win by a large

10945.319 --> 10950.479
amount in 2016. he lost the popular vote

10948.56 --> 10952.039999999999
and like there was a time where you

10950.479 --> 10954.74
would want a candidate that you would

10952.04 --> 10957.380000000001
hope could at least you know win the

10954.74 --> 10958.899
popular vote right especially against I

10957.38 --> 10961.778999999999
would say the most

10958.899 --> 10964.278999999999
disgusting candidate of all time yeah

10961.779 --> 10966.979000000001
yeah but that's but that's the reason

10964.279 --> 10969.92
why it works because everybody just saw

10966.979 --> 10973.278999999999
it coming like oh no oh no not Hillary

10969.92 --> 10975.5
no no oh my God it was almost like a

10973.279 --> 10979.220000000001
panic flood it's like

10975.5 --> 10981.68
well Trump could do it so let's just go

10979.22 --> 10983.24
with him before freaking Hillary

10981.68 --> 10985.880000000001
you know

10983.24 --> 10988.76
right and that worked in 2016. I don't

10985.88 --> 10990.199999999999
think it could work again I can't he

10988.76 --> 10993.14
said he said he would put her in jail

10990.2 --> 10996.2
and he literally hasn't it hasn't made

10993.14 --> 10997.76
any progress in that at all so he's just

10996.2 --> 11000.640000000001
not gonna do that he can't do that again

10997.76 --> 11003.34
because he literally broke that promise

11000.64 --> 11005.5
right no I mean yeah that that that line

11003.34 --> 11007.24
right there during that debate and he

11005.5 --> 11009.22
said in other times but when he said it

11007.24 --> 11012.479
to her face you'd be I'm gonna put him

11009.22 --> 11015.699999999999
in jail put her in jail crooked Hillary

11012.479 --> 11017.8
that's an iconic moment that that very

11015.7 --> 11019.720000000001
well might have won him the election

11017.8 --> 11021.819
I

11019.72 --> 11024.34
and again though barely his upside just

11021.819 --> 11027.039999999999
isn't that big because he's just there's

11024.34 --> 11030.0
there's two everybody there's nobody on

11027.04 --> 11032.5
the face of the planet planet

11030.0 --> 11037.0
that's gonna change uh their their

11032.5 --> 11039.58
opinion on on Donald Trump at this point

11037.0 --> 11041.02
except maybe me like I said if he showed

11039.58 --> 11043.359
a little bit of humility I might

11041.02 --> 11045.7
actually vote for him but

11043.359 --> 11048.399000000001
I I don't see that happening it just

11045.7 --> 11049.779
vote for Shiva and then and then you'll

11048.399 --> 11051.58
find out that it doesn't really matter

11049.779 --> 11053.979000000001
anyway I don't think that voting is

11051.58 --> 11055.72
actually I think it's now fully

11053.979 --> 11058.0
automated it's like whatever you're

11055.72 --> 11059.56
gonna do yeah it's just like oh they're

11058.0 --> 11061.359
just gonna tell you what the vote

11059.56 --> 11064.119999999999
results are I don't think

11061.359 --> 11067.960000000001
the counting is legitimate anymore

11064.12 --> 11070.479000000001
right I I agree it's probably a

11067.96 --> 11072.699999999999
pointless exercise it's like the people

11070.479 --> 11074.26
will count them they put it on numbers

11072.7 --> 11076.300000000001
on a piece of paper the number with the

11074.26 --> 11079.66
piece of paper is then

11076.3 --> 11081.759999999998
stored but then the computer or whatever

11079.66 --> 11083.26
puts it all together and you'll just get

11081.76 --> 11085.18
completely different results and it's

11083.26 --> 11086.380000000001
like too complicated to actually

11085.18 --> 11088.24
backtrack

11086.38 --> 11089.5
so it's like yeah the computer just says

11088.24 --> 11092.14
this

11089.5 --> 11095.319
right I mean it's crazy that we actually

11092.14 --> 11098.26
even get that done in the amount of time

11095.319 --> 11101.319
that we do yeah and it's taken longer

11098.26 --> 11103.0
now but I even when I was young I was

11101.319 --> 11105.34
always like how on Earth is this

11103.0 --> 11109.12
possible that I can know like the same

11105.34 --> 11110.92
night who won that's it's it's really

11109.12 --> 11113.5
mind-numbing when you think about how

11110.92 --> 11115.54
how much goes into that

11113.5 --> 11118.18
well they do it with a lot of estimation

11115.54 --> 11121.359
and then eventually

11118.18 --> 11123.460000000001
it's almost like decided upon it's like

11121.359 --> 11126.04
yeah we're just gonna go with this one

11123.46 --> 11128.259999999998
is the winner and then in the final

11126.04 --> 11129.76
ultimate final end it might even be like

11128.26 --> 11132.64
oh he actually

11129.76 --> 11134.74
just didn't one but it's like right yeah

11132.64 --> 11137.56
but we already decided that he won so

11134.74 --> 11139.119999999999
that's just what's gonna happen right I

11137.56 --> 11141.22
think and is that isn't that kind of

11139.12 --> 11142.899000000001
depressing too either way like either

11141.22 --> 11145.179999999998
it's right to the extent that the

11142.899 --> 11147.58
outcomes a foregone conclusion or human

11145.18 --> 11150.04
beings behavior in mass is so

11147.58 --> 11151.899
predictable that we can estimate this

11150.04 --> 11153.880000000001
like that in fact I don't know which

11151.899 --> 11156.64
one's more depressing

11153.88 --> 11158.019999999999
uh

11156.64 --> 11159.58
I don't know

11158.02 --> 11162.7
I don't know

11159.58 --> 11164.56
I mean it'll eventually like people will

11162.7 --> 11166.6
just

11164.56 --> 11170.439
stop biting

11166.6 --> 11173.2
like if enough like election results are

11170.439 --> 11175.6
like completely asymmetrical

11173.2 --> 11178.0
like the last time then like at some

11175.6 --> 11179.68
point people are literally gonna like

11178.0 --> 11182.38
they're not gonna follow it anymore if

11179.68 --> 11184.960000000001
it's just stolen every time

11182.38 --> 11188.08
they're gonna just be done with it

11184.96 --> 11190.96
eventually right and good luck knowing

11188.08 --> 11193.899
when that point is I mean already in the

11190.96 --> 11196.179999999998
U.S 35 40 of people don't vote in

11193.899 --> 11199.539999999999
elections and that's been the case for a

11196.18 --> 11202.960000000001
long time and I I would have thought

11199.54 --> 11205.359
even around 2020 that you'd see a

11202.96 --> 11207.339999999998
decline but the numbers actually went up

11205.359 --> 11208.960000000001
in in the presidential election from the

11207.34 --> 11211.3
previous one as far as participation

11208.96 --> 11214.358999999999
goes but again you take it with a grain

11211.3 --> 11216.84
of salt because a how do we really know

11214.359 --> 11219.04
how many people are even in the country

11216.84 --> 11220.66
and then obviously all the other

11219.04 --> 11222.880000000001
problems we were talking about as far as

11220.66 --> 11224.56
the legitimacy of counting the votes so

11222.88 --> 11228.119999999999
right

11224.56 --> 11228.119999999999
it's super hectic and

11229.66 --> 11235.18
yeah so let's randomly select people

11232.479 --> 11237.88
let's do it anybody of voting it

11235.18 --> 11240.1
in it that's just throw them in in a

11237.88 --> 11241.839999999998
random number generator or actually not

11240.1 --> 11244.84
because that can be right let's use like

11241.84 --> 11248.26
the actual balls that they use for the

11244.84 --> 11251.979
lotto or or Bingo and and and do it that

11248.26 --> 11254.439
way put uh put a billion balls in the

11251.979 --> 11256.72
thing and that's your president it's a

11254.439 --> 11259.300000000001
funny idea but I think it's better to

11256.72 --> 11260.679999999998
just not have presidents then

11259.3 --> 11263.019999999999
right

11260.68 --> 11265.0
you know what's funny too though is that

11263.02 --> 11267.720000000001
uh actually what I'm saying is something

11265.0 --> 11271.06
that the wef is proposing

11267.72 --> 11273.22
really so I I yeah well but then it's

11271.06 --> 11276.399
just going to be ceremonial

11273.22 --> 11279.42
well right yeah you can pick a random if

11276.399 --> 11279.42
it's just ceremonial

11279.46 --> 11283.539999999999
they wanted to be more specific and you

11281.56 --> 11285.88
cut down the pool of candidates and like

11283.54 --> 11287.560000000001
you have to you know so obviously you

11285.88 --> 11289.96
aren't in the pool of candidates unless

11287.56 --> 11291.819
you agree with us sort of thing yeah of

11289.96 --> 11293.019999999999
course so yeah ceremony

11291.819 --> 11295.359
uh-huh

11293.02 --> 11298.12
right

11295.359 --> 11301.5
right ah bro we've gone the show has

11298.12 --> 11301.5
been going for over three hours

11303.16 --> 11307.6
yeah we've been talking for almost too

11305.439 --> 11310.6
two hours really

11307.6 --> 11313.54
yeah it's been that long I joined about

11310.6 --> 11315.52
yeah I joined about 8 50 my time and

11313.54 --> 11319.359
it's 10 40 now

11315.52 --> 11322.060000000001
call sort of two like little bit before

11319.359 --> 11326.380000000001
oh yeah we've been going for an hour 45

11322.06 --> 11328.42
minutes yeah yeah time is flying this

11326.38 --> 11331.42
keeps happening like for the audience

11328.42 --> 11334.359
like this happens all the time

11331.42 --> 11335.979
yeah it really is I mean I legitimately

11334.359 --> 11337.84
was shocked talking to you the other day

11335.979 --> 11341.019999999999
that it was already time for qe's show

11337.84 --> 11342.34
I'm like oh my gosh so

11341.02 --> 11345.1
yep

11342.34 --> 11349.66
but yeah it's good you want to like

11345.1 --> 11351.7
maybe maneuver away from politics yeah

11349.66 --> 11354.819
is maybe not everybody in the chat

11351.7 --> 11356.740000000002
really likes that discussion but no I I

11354.819 --> 11359.08
bet not but it was good to talk about

11356.74 --> 11360.279
for a bit there's a lot going on out

11359.08 --> 11363.52
there

11360.279 --> 11366.04
ah yeah I mean I just don't nothing

11363.52 --> 11367.84
offends me I forget that too because I

11366.04 --> 11371.140000000001
think I'm not really offended because

11367.84 --> 11375.76
I'm not a fan of anybody in politics

11371.14 --> 11378.039999999999
like never happen so I I really kind of

11375.76 --> 11380.74
take a as much of a third person

11378.04 --> 11383.26
perspective to it as possible but I

11380.74 --> 11384.88
apologies to anybody that that loves

11383.26 --> 11387.22
Biden I'm sure that there's lots of you

11384.88 --> 11388.42
guys out there

11387.22 --> 11391.8
right

11388.42 --> 11391.8
what else can we talk about

11392.859 --> 11396.300000000001
um I'm actually getting kind of hungry

11397.18 --> 11402.58
but that's okay I was gonna pick I

11400.24 --> 11405.039999999999
thought of something uh to go back to

11402.58 --> 11407.68
slightly Tesla and all right of

11405.04 --> 11409.060000000001
promoting him as an as an ether as an

11407.68 --> 11411.939
ether rights

11409.06 --> 11414.819
um doesn't QE have that one quote about

11411.939 --> 11417.16
Tesla regarding the the photon though if

11414.819 --> 11419.019999999999
I recall I I don't remember the context

11417.16 --> 11422.5
you know what quote I'm talking about

11419.02 --> 11425.800000000001
no I don't remember either all right

11422.5 --> 11428.859
well that doesn't help then but

11425.8 --> 11431.38
no I like I don't keep perfect track of

11428.859 --> 11434.800000000001
everything that QE says with his quote

11431.38 --> 11436.42
farming and all that right because there

11434.8 --> 11438.099999999999
I have a lot of doubts about a lot of

11436.42 --> 11440.14
things in physics

11438.1 --> 11441.52
especially things that relate to the

11440.14 --> 11443.68
nature of light

11441.52 --> 11444.960000000001
which is kind of overt

11443.68 --> 11449.2
so

11444.96 --> 11451.839999999998
QE does like quote find good quotes he

11449.2 --> 11454.899000000001
knows them but I just don't necessarily

11451.84 --> 11457.18
have the same weight on them it's like

11454.899 --> 11460.119999999999
if you literally can't mechanically

11457.18 --> 11461.979000000001
explain exactly why

11460.12 --> 11464.380000000001
then I don't give a [ __ ] about what

11461.979 --> 11466.0
somebody said in history no matter how

11464.38 --> 11470.019999999999
good they allegedly are if you can't

11466.0 --> 11472.84
explain it then I don't care

11470.02 --> 11474.880000000001
sure anybody could say anything

11472.84 --> 11476.859
yeah I agree with that I was only

11474.88 --> 11478.3
thinking in that because I've never

11476.859 --> 11480.460000000001
actually

11478.3 --> 11483.22
heard the quote that he said about Tesla

11480.46 --> 11485.08
and I have always had the idea too which

11483.22 --> 11487.899
I think is the mainstream idea that

11485.08 --> 11489.399
Tesla is a big background invisible

11487.899 --> 11490.55
energy guy

11489.399 --> 11492.519999999999
all right

11490.55 --> 11494.619999999999
[Music]

11492.52 --> 11497.380000000001
but again who cares what Tesla says

11494.62 --> 11500.380000000001
though even like that's it right

11497.38 --> 11502.778999999999
right well I think that he was just

11500.38 --> 11503.8
highlighted and created into an iconic

11502.779 --> 11506.68
figure

11503.8 --> 11508.599999999999
that was supposedly figuring out all

11506.68 --> 11510.399
this technology and then it kind of

11508.6 --> 11512.140000000001
fizzled with him

11510.399 --> 11515.76
that's what they like to do because then

11512.14 --> 11518.979
people will believe that it's gone

11515.76 --> 11520.899
that it's not being applied while in his

11518.979 --> 11523.3
age I bet that there were a whole bunch

11520.899 --> 11526.3
of other individuals that were doing

11523.3 --> 11527.92
similar things as Tesla and they never

11526.3 --> 11530.14
got on the radar

11527.92 --> 11531.88
Yeah a hundred percent there are like

11530.14 --> 11534.099999999999
I've read through several of their their

11531.88 --> 11535.72
names and their their names are lost the

11534.1 --> 11538.300000000001
time it's

11535.72 --> 11540.699999999999
again those we kind of the 19th century

11538.3 --> 11542.399
is just fascinating because I really

11540.7 --> 11544.42
think people were

11542.399 --> 11546.699999999999
rediscovering a lot of things doing

11544.42 --> 11548.979
applications and we didn't really have

11546.7 --> 11550.66
and this is when we're obviously the

11548.979 --> 11553.179999999998
patent system goes back further than

11550.66 --> 11556.18
that I think like it goes back to the

11553.18 --> 11558.58
16th century and and England is a lot of

11556.18 --> 11561.1
the basis of the modern patent system

11558.58 --> 11562.84
but the 19th century is really where it

11561.1 --> 11565.68
started to get going and everything

11562.84 --> 11567.7
became uniform I I mean right it became

11565.68 --> 11570.7
industrialized standardized the

11567.7 --> 11573.399000000001
standardization progress curve that's

11570.7 --> 11575.5
what really happened mostly like early

11573.399 --> 11576.88
20th century because it was like the

11575.5 --> 11580.06
peak of all this development people

11576.88 --> 11582.278999999999
don't realize that but it was a peak of

11580.06 --> 11584.74
electrical development it wasn't the

11582.279 --> 11587.26
start it was the peak

11584.74 --> 11589.06
yes it's the it's that I'd argue the

11587.26 --> 11591.58
peak of this iteration of civilization

11589.06 --> 11594.34
too which ties into another reason why

11591.58 --> 11596.2
this is so hard for uh like globers

11594.34 --> 11598.18
especially or anything because a lot of

11596.2 --> 11600.819000000001
these myths go hand in hand with the

11598.18 --> 11602.979000000001
myth of you know Eternal progress and

11600.819 --> 11605.8
that right now we are at the peak of our

11602.979 --> 11607.179999999998
civilization where like there is not

11605.8 --> 11609.16
anything that I think is more

11607.18 --> 11611.439
demonstrably false to anybody's eyes

11609.16 --> 11615.52
than than trying to argue that this is

11611.439 --> 11617.68
the peak of civilization right now like

11615.52 --> 11619.66
just again look at our infrastructure

11617.68 --> 11622.359
look at our architecture look at

11619.66 --> 11625.3
anything you want to look at and we are

11622.359 --> 11627.880000000001
called The Ruins we built stuff on

11625.3 --> 11630.22
look at the things that have been used

11627.88 --> 11632.259999999998
like did you know that uh

11630.22 --> 11638.199999999999
like old London

11632.26 --> 11640.479
at like a a gas pressured subway system

11638.2 --> 11641.68
did you know that where they had tubes

11640.479 --> 11644.858999999999
yes

11641.68 --> 11649.84
yeah craziest thing ever it's like yeah

11644.859 --> 11652.02
that was the 19th century what the [ __ ]

11649.84 --> 11652.02
foreign

11652.439 --> 11659.439
mass transit like what

11656.5 --> 11662.5
right I yeah I get our mass transit

11659.439 --> 11664.300000000001
everywhere was so much better even just

11662.5 --> 11666.819
a hundred years ago that than it is now

11664.3 --> 11669.819
and we basically torn those systems

11666.819 --> 11672.819
apart largely to for the promotion of

11669.819 --> 11674.979
the automobile in a lot of cases but I'm

11672.819 --> 11677.68
sure it's also to kind of keep people in

11674.979 --> 11679.42
manageable little bubble bubbles

11677.68 --> 11681.64
so you can

11679.42 --> 11684.1
track their progress more easily I've

11681.64 --> 11685.96
also heard about like England that I I

11684.1 --> 11688.899000000001
believe something about the

11685.96 --> 11690.938999999998
the channel and how old that that might

11688.899 --> 11692.68
have been underground and that there

11690.939 --> 11695.14
could have been involved some

11692.68 --> 11697.42
some uh of the pneumatic tubes you're

11695.14 --> 11700.119999999999
talking about there too but I'm not yeah

11697.42 --> 11702.1
but it was it was part of that it's all

11700.12 --> 11703.12
there it's all the the layer below

11702.1 --> 11706.300000000001
London

11703.12 --> 11708.640000000001
right there's all kinds of stuff that

11706.3 --> 11710.92
they built there was a whole Industrial

11708.64 --> 11713.319
Revolution happening there

11710.92 --> 11716.38
and it's kind of been muffled over

11713.319 --> 11719.439
just been like oh never stop doing that

11716.38 --> 11722.56
right and the layer be beneath every

11719.439 --> 11724.12
city too I mean and in over in Europe

11722.56 --> 11726.819
it's a little bit more understandable

11724.12 --> 11729.1
but we we have you know the underground

11726.819 --> 11731.939
cities and underground city quote

11729.1 --> 11734.08
unquote of Seattle or any any major

11731.939 --> 11735.939
Metropolitan Hub Seattle's a good one

11734.08 --> 11738.0
though because of how late that that was

11735.939 --> 11740.74
supposed to be yeah look at New York

11738.0 --> 11742.42
right yes it's the biggest underground

11740.74 --> 11746.619999999999
city in the world

11742.42 --> 11749.439
right yeah it's scary there

11746.62 --> 11752.2
like right and you do have the the the

11749.439 --> 11755.439
footage and the pictures of people in

11752.2 --> 11757.84
the little circular uh train things that

11755.439 --> 11758.880000000001
right I think those were steam powered a

11757.84 --> 11761.8
lot of times

11758.88 --> 11763.92
and then to go back to Tesla now or

11761.8 --> 11766.74
rather Elon Musk

11763.92 --> 11769.779
and then you can pair that to his

11766.74 --> 11771.939
lame-ass uh underground tunnels that he

11769.779 --> 11774.819000000001
was trying to make it's pathetic like

11771.939 --> 11779.2
absolutely pathetic

11774.819 --> 11781.6
his boring company yeah

11779.2 --> 11784.240000000002
and I mean I I kind of like the idea of

11781.6 --> 11785.92
an underground transport system that

11784.24 --> 11788.26
will be more efficient

11785.92 --> 11790.359
that could be more personal it's an

11788.26 --> 11791.859
interesting idea it's just not very

11790.359 --> 11794.140000000001
original

11791.859 --> 11796.24
right because it was already there

11794.14 --> 11799.119999999999
right

11796.24 --> 11800.319
yeah his is not really original and it's

11799.12 --> 11803.380000000001
only

11800.319 --> 11806.14
really just a takeoff of his you know

11803.38 --> 11808.358999999999
automobile technology it's not really

11806.14 --> 11809.979
pushing the envelope or using any of the

11808.359 --> 11811.899000000001
things that that they used to use with

11809.979 --> 11814.358999999999
just I mean compressed air or or

11811.899 --> 11817.0
whatever you want to use there's lots of

11814.359 --> 11820.6
ways to to do this that we simply don't

11817.0 --> 11823.06
explore right well look you could have a

11820.6 --> 11826.54
pretty interesting system where you

11823.06 --> 11829.66
could have like this Subterranean Hyper

11826.54 --> 11832.720000000001
Speed Trend like personalized transport

11829.66 --> 11834.819
pods that could fit a car where you

11832.72 --> 11837.34
literally like oh you're just gonna I'm

11834.819 --> 11841.359
gonna take that pod you just door open

11837.34 --> 11843.58
you drive in with your car door closed

11841.359 --> 11845.56
and you're off you're to another

11843.58 --> 11847.66
continent very fast and then you just

11845.56 --> 11851.039999999999
drive out you could make that

11847.66 --> 11851.039999999999
you could make that right now

11851.979 --> 11856.438999999998
like I'm for that like why not

11856.54 --> 11862.26
that's pretty cool but I I still I just

11859.96 --> 11866.199999999999
wanna I just want to blimp personally

11862.26 --> 11867.7
yeah but yeah I get that but then you're

11866.2 --> 11870.34
gonna have blimps everywhere you know

11867.7 --> 11872.859
then you're gonna have that issue

11870.34 --> 11874.66
you can definitely have traffic jams in

11872.859 --> 11875.800000000001
the sky and you don't want to get to

11874.66 --> 11878.92
that point

11875.8 --> 11881.5
yeah that's that's true I'm just saying

11878.92 --> 11883.92
they don't need a blimp Arwen I need a

11881.5 --> 11883.92
blimp

11884.08 --> 11888.039999999999
well it would be kind of fun if if

11885.819 --> 11890.439
blimps could be like used like public

11888.04 --> 11892.779
transport bus systems

11890.439 --> 11895.6
where you can basically have a blimp or

11892.779 --> 11896.979000000001
a couple like buses going from building

11895.6 --> 11899.979000000001
to building

11896.979 --> 11902.08
that's doable but no private possession

11899.979 --> 11905.438999999998
of that [ __ ] that's just way too

11902.08 --> 11908.26
dangerous and chaotic

11905.439 --> 11909.76
and I think some people would argue I

11908.26 --> 11912.22
mean there's that always the footage

11909.76 --> 11915.279
that possibly even a couple hundred

11912.22 --> 11918.399
years ago they were doing that at that

11915.279 --> 11920.5
level I mean we we obviously are aware

11918.399 --> 11923.5
of some of the airships and blimps that

11920.5 --> 11925.0
existed and were obviously aware of the

11923.5 --> 11927.52
configuration of some of these tall

11925.0 --> 11929.5
skyscrapers that looks like well they

11927.52 --> 11931.720000000001
use blimps before they had helicopters

11929.5 --> 11935.2
now they have helicopter pads on big

11931.72 --> 11937.96
buildings right right before that yeah

11935.2 --> 11939.16
they use blimps

11937.96 --> 11941.259999999998
mm-hmm

11939.16 --> 11943.66
that's how you could go from the top of

11941.26 --> 11946.72
a building to another top of a building

11943.66 --> 11949.359
sure the question is always one of scale

11946.72 --> 11951.16
as far as that goes how prevalent were

11949.359 --> 11954.7
they were they more prevalent than we've

11951.16 --> 11957.039999999999
been led to believe and if so why well

11954.7 --> 11958.66
they weren't super rare there were

11957.04 --> 11961.18
pretty much blimps

11958.66 --> 11963.76
like Gotham City there was always a

11961.18 --> 11965.68
blimp in the sky basically like that but

11963.76 --> 11967.300000000001
it's not like it was all filled up with

11965.68 --> 11970.899
Glimpse everywhere

11967.3 --> 11972.519999999999
it's like no but every Big City probably

11970.899 --> 11973.68
had a few that would just keep going

11972.52 --> 11977.2
around

11973.68 --> 11979.68
like an Airbus

11977.2 --> 11979.68
right

11980.14 --> 11984.278999999999
yeah and then

11981.7 --> 11986.380000000001
then the oh the humanity happened and

11984.279 --> 11988.060000000001
yeah Hindenburg oh now it's too

11986.38 --> 11989.199999999999
dangerous all of a sudden

11988.06 --> 11991.3
right

11989.2 --> 11993.7
even though that's just I mean again

11991.3 --> 11998.74
that's just a hydrogen that was the

11993.7 --> 12001.62
issue there and you can use helium yep

11998.74 --> 12004.68
yeah it's all nonsense

12001.62 --> 12007.08
I do I do Wonder though that uh

12004.68 --> 12010.2
whether there's something more specific

12007.08 --> 12014.279
there because obviously hydrogen is a

12010.2 --> 12017.76
lighter gas than helium so I wonder when

12014.279 --> 12020.460000000001
applied to a blimp how much that impacts

12017.76 --> 12023.7
the the altitude that you can get

12020.46 --> 12025.278999999999
versus the two if it's tangible at all

12023.7 --> 12028.92
well

12025.279 --> 12031.08
it helps a bit but I mean at the same

12028.92 --> 12034.5
time the hazards are incredible because

12031.08 --> 12036.84
sure it's so freaking small there's no

12034.5 --> 12039.6
material that can truly hold it forever

12036.84 --> 12042.56
it's gonna leak through everything

12039.6 --> 12046.02
so it the hydrogen sucks

12042.56 --> 12048.96
it's extremely explosive and you can't

12046.02 --> 12051.479000000001
contain it it really sucks helium is

12048.96 --> 12052.74
better it's more reliable it's not

12051.479 --> 12055.679999999998
flammable

12052.74 --> 12058.02
and oh no it's not the lightest guest of

12055.68 --> 12060.720000000001
all time but yeah I mean

12058.02 --> 12062.460000000001
at the same time it's non-flammable and

12060.72 --> 12064.438999999998
it doesn't leak out of everything that

12062.46 --> 12065.46
that seems like a worthwhile trade-off

12064.439 --> 12066.899
there

12065.46 --> 12069.0
right

12066.899 --> 12071.34
and when you suck helium you make funny

12069.0 --> 12073.74
voices too yeah

12071.34 --> 12077.279
perfect so

12073.74 --> 12080.42
right what happens if you suck hydrogen

12077.279 --> 12080.42
uh nothing

12080.76 --> 12086.479
I think I think you can actually breathe

12082.979 --> 12086.479
hydrogen I'm not sure though

12086.88 --> 12092.16
right I mean obviously depends on the

12089.1 --> 12094.380000000001
concentration too but

12092.16 --> 12095.279
yeah I I don't know that's a good

12094.38 --> 12097.199999999999
question

12095.279 --> 12099.66
maybe the chat can answer that what

12097.2 --> 12101.220000000001
happens when you suck hydrogen

12099.66 --> 12103.5
I don't think the chat's really

12101.22 --> 12106.26
following our conversation oh probably

12103.5 --> 12109.68
not they're just talking about other

12106.26 --> 12111.779
stuff ball tards back and forth

12109.68 --> 12112.859
mctoon was trying to bicker with

12111.779 --> 12116.399000000001
somebody

12112.859 --> 12119.220000000001
original D Rose is talking about how his

12116.399 --> 12122.34
dad had his leg amputated because of a

12119.22 --> 12125.88
polio shot that's like yeah they're

12122.34 --> 12129.54
having their own conversation there

12125.88 --> 12132.24
yeah my grandfather like I said he he

12129.54 --> 12135.18
had a he had Polio he didn't he had

12132.24 --> 12138.479
Polio before in the shot though and his

12135.18 --> 12141.720000000001
leg got very very tiny but he managed to

12138.479 --> 12146.519999999999
hobble around on it for 50 plus years

12141.72 --> 12149.278999999999
after that so oh good for him huh

12146.52 --> 12153.859
yeah it's crazy too like his his leg was

12149.279 --> 12157.2
his I if I recall his left leg was

12153.859 --> 12158.819
literally about a fifth the size of his

12157.2 --> 12161.640000000001
of his right leg

12158.819 --> 12163.68
wow okay the doctors told him he

12161.64 --> 12166.26
shouldn't have been able to like walk

12163.68 --> 12168.42
but he he always did

12166.26 --> 12171.12
a fifth

12168.42 --> 12174.42
but that's like that's that's totally

12171.12 --> 12175.979000000001
shrunken like literally not much more

12174.42 --> 12179.04
than the bone and a little bit of muscle

12175.979 --> 12181.399
like it's crazy so his left leg was

12179.04 --> 12184.439
basically the size of his hand

12181.399 --> 12188.46
yes what the [ __ ] okay yeah yeah that's

12184.439 --> 12191.279
not much no wild to look at like again

12188.46 --> 12194.16
how he got on but you know if you put

12191.279 --> 12196.380000000001
your your mind to it you can you can

12194.16 --> 12198.899
model through a lot I've always liked

12196.38 --> 12202.199999999999
the uh example of the people with uh

12198.899 --> 12204.66
what is it called hydro and and I can't

12202.2 --> 12206.34
pronounce it but your your brain is like

12204.66 --> 12207.56
mostly water

12206.34 --> 12210.12
like

12207.56 --> 12212.519999999999
that instead of brain matter there

12210.12 --> 12214.92
you're you're your cranial cavity is

12212.52 --> 12216.6
filled with largely water and there's

12214.92 --> 12219.0
been people that have lived completely

12216.6 --> 12221.220000000001
normal lives like that yeah it's

12219.0 --> 12224.279
incredible I've known one I had an

12221.22 --> 12227.58
ex-girlfriend that literally had like a

12224.279 --> 12230.939
a big hole in her head and like she

12227.58 --> 12233.46
shouldn't be able to be functioning but

12230.939 --> 12234.6
she was like perfectly and really smart

12233.46 --> 12236.64
too

12234.6 --> 12239.52
this is like wow she had a hole where

12236.64 --> 12241.92
normally the entire cognition brain is

12239.52 --> 12245.04
like it wasn't there and she was

12241.92 --> 12246.84
frictioning perfectly it's like what

12245.04 --> 12249.6
right

12246.84 --> 12251.52
how is that possible yeah it is because

12249.6 --> 12253.02
your brain is not the thing that makes

12251.52 --> 12256.02
you think really

12253.02 --> 12258.84
right and apparently there we have

12256.02 --> 12261.899000000001
redundancy as far as the physical body

12258.84 --> 12266.460000000001
goes I mean obviously I think that it's

12261.899 --> 12269.399
we're kind of well our Consciousness is

12266.46 --> 12272.46
essentially some kind of frequency and

12269.399 --> 12274.739
we're kind of animating ourselves I mean

12272.46 --> 12277.019999999999
this is an original thought at all with

12274.739 --> 12278.22
that when it comes through a perineal

12277.02 --> 12279.6
gland that's where the Consciousness

12278.22 --> 12280.979
comes from that's where the soul

12279.6 --> 12282.66
connection is that's where your

12280.979 --> 12284.58
information is stored it's in the spirit

12282.66 --> 12287.52
it's in the form of energy it's not in

12284.58 --> 12290.16
the flesh there's no data being written

12287.52 --> 12294.0
down like a hard disk but what happens

12290.16 --> 12295.92
though is that the activity

12294.0 --> 12297.84
the energy of the activity there is

12295.92 --> 12299.04
energy happening when you think that's

12297.84 --> 12301.26
provable

12299.04 --> 12304.380000000001
so there must be energy going through it

12301.26 --> 12308.1
and leaving like an imprint it's like a

12304.38 --> 12310.739
guy every time making sure that the seat

12308.1 --> 12312.720000000001
is perfect for him right and I think

12310.739 --> 12315.18
that that's what actually does happen

12312.72 --> 12316.92
with the brain it's like a

12315.18 --> 12319.439
an archive

12316.92 --> 12321.899
it's an extra archive where the

12319.439 --> 12325.34
information is stored so that you'll be

12321.899 --> 12327.96
able to quicker catch it

12325.34 --> 12330.42
right back but it's still the spirit

12327.96 --> 12333.3
that has it it's just it makes it easier

12330.42 --> 12335.76
for the spirit to communicate it

12333.3 --> 12338.22
to the physical world

12335.76 --> 12339.72
it's like you will because I don't think

12338.22 --> 12343.019999999999
that you can actually forget anything

12339.72 --> 12345.06
you can just have it Out Of Reach

12343.02 --> 12347.04
but I don't think a person can ever

12345.06 --> 12348.539999999999
actually forget anything they have ever

12347.04 --> 12351.300000000001
witnessed

12348.54 --> 12352.380000000001
right it will always be somewhere

12351.3 --> 12354.84
like

12352.38 --> 12358.319
it never goes away memories actually

12354.84 --> 12360.42
don't really go away you might not have

12358.319 --> 12362.64
the full implications you might not have

12360.42 --> 12365.64
the details but the memory

12362.64 --> 12369.358999999999
is still there as like a feeling print

12365.64 --> 12372.0
it's like a thing happened you might not

12369.359 --> 12374.7
be able to show the details of it or

12372.0 --> 12379.68
translate it but you know it happened

12374.7 --> 12381.6
like that that information is never lost

12379.68 --> 12383.399
right and it's it's almost because it's

12381.6 --> 12385.140000000001
part of you like you can never forget

12383.399 --> 12389.519999999999
anything that's happened to you because

12385.14 --> 12392.34
it's literally a part of what forms you

12389.52 --> 12394.319000000001
your program is built with it so it's

12392.34 --> 12396.0
always there

12394.319 --> 12397.519999999999
right and it's a matter of kind of

12396.0 --> 12400.38
getting yourself into the right

12397.52 --> 12402.66
configuration to recall it it's like the

12400.38 --> 12404.519999999999
way that uh sense like smelling

12402.66 --> 12406.5
something can oftentimes bring back a

12404.52 --> 12409.08
memory yeah related memories yeah

12406.5 --> 12410.279
Associated memories and so can emotions

12409.08 --> 12412.319
by the way

12410.279 --> 12414.779
specifically emotions do that actually

12412.319 --> 12418.26
I've even explained that a few days ago

12414.779 --> 12420.979000000001
on my show even like how

12418.26 --> 12423.899
if you're like a really feeling person

12420.979 --> 12425.76
that the way you look on the world is

12423.899 --> 12427.979
really dependent on what you feel and

12425.76 --> 12430.319
that if something happens that changes

12427.979 --> 12432.119999999999
that feeling that that literally changes

12430.319 --> 12433.739
how you see the world and what you even

12432.12 --> 12436.08
know about the world

12433.739 --> 12439.319
because certainly oh this thing happens

12436.08 --> 12441.0
well every time that happened before all

12439.319 --> 12442.56
those memories suddenly all come back to

12441.0 --> 12444.3
you

12442.56 --> 12446.46
right and then when the feeling's over

12444.3 --> 12448.38
suddenly you forget all about it that

12446.46 --> 12451.739
doesn't exist anymore

12448.38 --> 12453.479
like always when it ends and that's how

12451.739 --> 12455.34
a lot of people's minds work they just

12453.479 --> 12457.56
whatever they feel

12455.34 --> 12460.68
Associated memories with that feeling

12457.56 --> 12462.6
and that State of Mind come back to them

12460.68 --> 12463.739
until the feeling goes away and then I

12462.6 --> 12466.439
forget about it

12463.739 --> 12468.779
right well and the difficult part is

12466.439 --> 12471.06
because obviously it's a limitation of

12468.779 --> 12473.220000000001
language we we refer to certain feelings

12471.06 --> 12475.199999999999
and such generalized terms but I know

12473.22 --> 12477.66
exactly what you mean I feel about

12475.2 --> 12479.880000000001
feelings like like your your boyfriend

12477.66 --> 12482.279
is breaking up with you or your

12479.88 --> 12484.38
girlfriend that's a certain way you're

12482.279 --> 12486.6
gonna feel when you go through that

12484.38 --> 12488.58
certainly you get a lot of more clarity

12486.6 --> 12490.92
about the memories of all the times that

12488.58 --> 12492.96
has happened that before Well normally

12490.92 --> 12495.6
that's not something that's passing

12492.96 --> 12498.599999999999
through you at all and that's what I

12495.6 --> 12501.66
meant it's really the memory bring the

12498.6 --> 12504.779
frequency or the the the situation

12501.66 --> 12506.88
brings the frequency the frequency has

12504.779 --> 12508.26
the associated memories and that's what

12506.88 --> 12511.319
comes back to you

12508.26 --> 12514.5
right and I'd sort of go on further with

12511.319 --> 12518.22
that to say that a lot of our physical

12514.5 --> 12520.02
structures are the result of repetition

12518.22 --> 12523.619999999999
like kind of how you're talking about

12520.02 --> 12525.66
how the brain is perhaps like a backup

12523.62 --> 12527.7
hard drive so to speak or something to

12525.66 --> 12530.88
make it it's it's formed out of habit

12527.7 --> 12533.220000000001
the same way that any idea we need to

12530.88 --> 12534.778999999999
develop and then build plans and then we

12533.22 --> 12536.58
can make something physically manifest

12534.779 --> 12538.68
well because see it like this you could

12536.58 --> 12542.34
metaphorically you could say the brain

12538.68 --> 12544.92
is like a castle for the Lord the spirit

12542.34 --> 12547.319
is the Lord and if the castle if the

12544.92 --> 12549.779
Lord goes around then the Castle is all

12547.319 --> 12552.06
fixed and built and it's optimized so he

12549.779 --> 12553.26
knows the castle he knows where to go

12552.06 --> 12555.119999999999
right

12553.26 --> 12557.16
and that's how I see the brain it's like

12555.12 --> 12559.92
the castle for the Lord and the Lord is

12557.16 --> 12563.84
your spirit but it's not the thing that

12559.92 --> 12567.0
does it it's the spirit that does it but

12563.84 --> 12569.880000000001
in conjunction with the spirit the

12567.0 --> 12572.16
overall end result can be optimized

12569.88 --> 12574.319
right we make physical objects kind of

12572.16 --> 12576.359
like we make shortcuts on our desktop

12574.319 --> 12578.64
for a computer

12576.359 --> 12580.62
it's not the actual location of the

12578.64 --> 12584.699999999999
object but it's a quicker way of the

12580.62 --> 12586.859
idea but it's a quicker way to get to it

12584.7 --> 12588.359
I mean I think that one could like that

12586.859 --> 12592.220000000001
kind of goes into the formation of

12588.359 --> 12592.220000000001
cancer and whatnot like

12592.64 --> 12598.92
repetition of negative emotion can can

12595.739 --> 12601.56
manifest as a as a tumor

12598.92 --> 12603.72
right negative impact is what they call

12601.56 --> 12604.68
that in Germany medicine

12603.72 --> 12606.3
um

12604.68 --> 12609.0
do you know what German new medicine

12606.3 --> 12612.06
I've talked about a few times on my show

12609.0 --> 12615.18
I vaguely I I do seem to recall the term

12612.06 --> 12616.859
but it's a radical different model of

12615.18 --> 12619.56
approach for diseases

12616.859 --> 12621.800000000001
it's more terrain Theory compatible but

12619.56 --> 12624.778999999999
it it really ascribes

12621.8 --> 12627.479
personal struggle and emotions and

12624.779 --> 12629.399000000001
resolve of conflicts like a trauma a

12627.479 --> 12632.819
traumatic thing that traumatized you in

12629.399 --> 12634.739
a way and then you resolve it you are

12632.819 --> 12637.019999999999
able to deal with it

12634.739 --> 12639.72
and then a disease starts happening

12637.02 --> 12641.880000000001
because the disease is like the side

12639.72 --> 12643.979
effect of the transformation of having

12641.88 --> 12646.38
resolved a conflict

12643.979 --> 12649.679999999998
and that's according to Germany medicine

12646.38 --> 12651.839999999998
how diseases come about and mostly like

12649.68 --> 12653.880000000001
as a symptom as a symptom that is in

12651.84 --> 12656.279
response to trauma

12653.88 --> 12658.14
and so not a process that suddenly

12656.279 --> 12660.5
starts happening and can go out of hand

12658.14 --> 12663.239
it's like no it's a direct

12660.5 --> 12667.02
response that directly equals in

12663.239 --> 12670.02
intensity to how intense the trauma was

12667.02 --> 12672.359
that has now been resolved

12670.02 --> 12674.399000000001
right that's how how it's basically

12672.359 --> 12676.02
arranged and it does like give you a

12674.399 --> 12677.819
whole new perspective when you apply

12676.02 --> 12681.479000000001
that to yourself because

12677.819 --> 12683.88
I don't fear disease anymore like at all

12681.479 --> 12687.96
like at all like I'm not gonna give into

12683.88 --> 12690.96
fear of disease ever again

12687.96 --> 12693.839999999998
because it's all natural it's all like

12690.96 --> 12695.58
part of the system and it only goes

12693.84 --> 12697.14
wrong when you don't accept that it's

12695.58 --> 12699.779
part of your system

12697.14 --> 12702.479
and you start to like try to fight the

12699.779 --> 12704.1
symptoms and then things will more

12702.479 --> 12706.679999999998
likely get out of hand

12704.1 --> 12708.779
because now you're not dealing with the

12706.68 --> 12712.52
the resolved conflict that's fixing

12708.779 --> 12716.16
itself biologically you're creating new

12712.52 --> 12717.899000000001
interventions in the process right it's

12716.16 --> 12719.76
like oh there's a revolution happening

12717.899 --> 12722.039999999999
and then suddenly an outsider from

12719.76 --> 12724.380000000001
another country starts invading that

12722.04 --> 12726.6
because oh yeah we need to fix that but

12724.38 --> 12728.46
it's like no that's a civil war thing

12726.6 --> 12730.5
that's among they're not going to be

12728.46 --> 12733.08
happy about you doing that

12730.5 --> 12734.16
right that's that sort of so that's how

12733.08 --> 12736.8
I see it

12734.16 --> 12738.84
right you got to be very careful

12736.8 --> 12742.14
and never like just Chase symptoms

12738.84 --> 12745.14
always chase the original root cause and

12742.14 --> 12748.8
German new medicine does provide a very

12745.14 --> 12752.039999999999
good model for that approach

12748.8 --> 12755.239
system system excuse me symptom masking

12752.04 --> 12755.239000000001
is so profitable

12756.12 --> 12760.439
it's the basis of Western medicine I

12758.46 --> 12762.8
mean it really is it's you're fighting a

12760.439 --> 12765.960000000001
war against your body

12762.8 --> 12768.66
you're at odds with it I I totally never

12765.96 --> 12770.88
it's it's terrain like you said train

12768.66 --> 12773.7
Theory and really any kind of

12770.88 --> 12775.619999999999
alternative medicine always is you have

12773.7 --> 12778.92
to get yourself in a good spot

12775.62 --> 12782.220000000001
emotionally mentally and then work from

12778.92 --> 12784.64
there right in combination with diet and

12782.22 --> 12787.58
other things too I I

12784.64 --> 12791.699999999999
spent a good amount of time looking into

12787.58 --> 12793.8
uh biome magnetic healing and I think

12791.7 --> 12796.2
that there's um but again like you still

12793.8 --> 12798.979
have to have the the emotional Baseline

12796.2 --> 12801.18
for any of that to work too yeah

12798.979 --> 12804.358999999999
biomagnetic that's interesting is that

12801.18 --> 12806.1
like magnetization yeah is that like a

12804.359 --> 12809.04
human skill

12806.1 --> 12811.800000000001
right like making uh actually using

12809.04 --> 12813.6
physical magnets although I imagine a

12811.8 --> 12815.34
really developed healer could do it

12813.6 --> 12817.68
without the magnets

12815.34 --> 12820.2
um I do something I don't know if it's

12817.68 --> 12823.800000000001
magnetic but I it's called magnetization

12820.2 --> 12827.34
and I can literally like extract tension

12823.8 --> 12829.5
out of Flesh out of my own it's how I

12827.34 --> 12832.68
get it I don't use any pain medication

12829.5 --> 12835.02
ever now because of that because I just

12832.68 --> 12837.239
don't need it even if it's really bad

12835.02 --> 12839.16
where normal people like get panicked

12837.239 --> 12842.399
and then call the doctor and [ __ ] or at

12839.16 --> 12846.0
a hospital I'm like nope I'll take care

12842.399 --> 12849.96
of that and I do and it goes away

12846.0 --> 12853.5
right including like toothache [ __ ]

12849.96 --> 12855.72
sure I've been uh always very reticent

12853.5 --> 12857.18
to go to a doctor but any kind of

12855.72 --> 12859.739
lingering

12857.18 --> 12861.899
desire to do that disappeared with the

12859.739 --> 12863.88
pandemic for certain like there's

12861.899 --> 12864.66
nothing that they can do to help you at

12863.88 --> 12867.179999999998
all

12864.66 --> 12869.52
nope well they were never really able to

12867.18 --> 12871.380000000001
do anything before that it's just like

12869.52 --> 12873.84
oh try all this stuff

12871.38 --> 12876.358999999999
right let me put a slight asterisk on

12873.84 --> 12878.22
that I think that we do have to a

12876.359 --> 12880.56
certain extent like if you're in a car

12878.22 --> 12883.56
crash or something like right I think

12880.56 --> 12885.66
that we're decent at putting things back

12883.56 --> 12888.42
together yeah but if you're going into

12885.66 --> 12889.8
yourself uh willingly if you're cutting

12888.42 --> 12890.52
yourself open you've already made a

12889.8 --> 12893.16
mistake

12890.52 --> 12895.62
at that point

12893.16 --> 12899.76
right

12895.62 --> 12902.52
but I agree it's uh yeah surgery

12899.76 --> 12904.68
and even plastic surgery I'm I'm fine

12902.52 --> 12907.140000000001
with that right it's people's own

12904.68 --> 12910.68
business but I think that like yeah

12907.14 --> 12912.539999999999
Patchwork and emergencies and perhaps

12910.68 --> 12914.819
plastic surgery

12912.54 --> 12917.939
to a certain degree I mean not

12914.819 --> 12920.66
transition that's whatever not getting

12917.939 --> 12923.64
into that but yeah it should be there

12920.66 --> 12926.1
because they're very good at it too I

12923.64 --> 12929.099999999999
mean I've seen people that were like

12926.1 --> 12931.26
completely mangled and unrecognizable in

12929.1 --> 12933.300000000001
accidents and then later they would be

12931.26 --> 12935.279
patched back up and they would actually

12933.3 --> 12938.64
look like how they looked and it's like

12935.279 --> 12940.62
how the hell did that surgeon do that

12938.64 --> 12942.479
like that's miraculous

12940.62 --> 12945.18
that they are able to do that is

12942.479 --> 12950.16
incredible so yeah I definitely want

12945.18 --> 12951.84
them around it's just when it comes to

12950.16 --> 12953.22
feelings

12951.84 --> 12955.979
health

12953.22 --> 12958.679999999998
stress levels food

12955.979 --> 12961.679999999998
screw them like uh you need to take care

12958.68 --> 12964.380000000001
of that yourself you need to know that

12961.68 --> 12967.2
to survive like that's a family lore

12964.38 --> 12969.778999999999
that is necessary or your family won't

12967.2 --> 12972.0
survive you can't rely on doctors for

12969.779 --> 12974.34
that [ __ ] they'll get you killed

12972.0 --> 12977.22
yeah they don't know what they're doing

12974.34 --> 12979.739
they're just following instruction books

12977.22 --> 12983.58
right were written by people that did

12979.739 --> 12985.14
not have health in mind

12983.58 --> 12986.76
and I mean it does make sense that

12985.14 --> 12988.519999999999
they're pretty decent at putting things

12986.76 --> 12991.5
together that has been the focus

12988.52 --> 12996.060000000001
essentially of Western medicine over the

12991.5 --> 12997.739
last 150 250 years that developing I

12996.06 --> 12999.119999999999
mean really it's funny because it's so

12997.739 --> 13002.0
simple the biggest thing that we

12999.12 --> 13004.34
discovered is just being cleaner with

13002.0 --> 13006.62
how we're doing things making sure that

13004.34 --> 13009.62
you've sterilized your event and and

13006.62 --> 13012.62
trying to keep all other infection to a

13009.62 --> 13015.2
minimum minimizing the toxic minimizing

13012.62 --> 13016.939
the toxic influence does the trick

13015.2 --> 13019.880000000001
right

13016.939 --> 13021.739
right but but the funny thing is like

13019.88 --> 13023.539999999999
there's this weird balance between like

13021.739 --> 13025.34
oh disinfecting

13023.54 --> 13028.1
right yeah because that's dangerous

13025.34 --> 13030.02
because the bacteria can give toxins and

13028.1 --> 13034.34
ruin the process yeah but at the same

13030.02 --> 13036.739
time most disinfectants are also toxic

13034.34 --> 13039.2
so there's this weird balance there and

13036.739 --> 13041.359
you can go wrong with it I mean all

13039.2 --> 13043.04
these people that are germophobic they

13041.359 --> 13044.779
all end up with allergies and [ __ ]

13043.04 --> 13048.5
because of it because they continually

13044.779 --> 13051.380000000001
expose themselves to toxic stuff

13048.5 --> 13053.66
right along with also of course the

13051.38 --> 13055.759999999998
mental configuration that right creating

13053.66 --> 13056.84
that or so too

13055.76 --> 13059.300000000001
yeah

13056.84 --> 13061.58
George Carlin even had a little routine

13059.3 --> 13062.42
about that about talking about like how

13061.58 --> 13064.52
he doesn't

13062.42 --> 13066.859
wash his hands after he wipes his ass

13064.52 --> 13070.460000000001
and he thinks that that helps him to an

13066.859 --> 13073.880000000001
extent because he's exposing himself to

13070.46 --> 13076.399
very small amounts of toxins but if you

13073.88 --> 13078.319
keep yourself in a bubble then obviously

13076.399 --> 13081.019999999999
you're gonna your body's not gonna know

13078.319 --> 13084.26
what to do and it's encountering

13081.02 --> 13088.640000000001
something more dangerous right

13084.26 --> 13090.739
yeah no I'm not like species are are a

13088.64 --> 13093.5
real danger of disease they are

13090.739 --> 13095.359
like you should oh like that's the

13093.5 --> 13096.979
reason why third world countries are

13095.359 --> 13098.720000000001
usually third world countries is because

13096.979 --> 13100.519999999999
they don't know it everything is

13098.72 --> 13102.619999999999
infected with feces everywhere and

13100.52 --> 13104.239
people it does make them sick that's

13102.62 --> 13106.819000000001
just provable it's not because of

13104.239 --> 13109.22
bacteria no it's because of the toxic

13106.819 --> 13112.1
crap that's in there literally this is

13109.22 --> 13113.96
why it's called crap right and you

13112.1 --> 13115.7
should be safe with that but that

13113.96 --> 13117.438999999998
doesn't mean that every time you you

13115.7 --> 13119.12
you'll wipe your ass you're gonna have

13117.439 --> 13121.7
to wash your hands with soap because

13119.12 --> 13123.26
soap are also a toxic influence just

13121.7 --> 13126.319000000001
make sure

13123.26 --> 13128.6
it's off your hands and then you're good

13126.319 --> 13130.58
right if it leaves some specific

13128.6 --> 13133.58
bacteria that are also in there that's

13130.58 --> 13135.68
no issue it isn't like your skin will

13133.58 --> 13138.039999999999
take care of that just don't leave the

13135.68 --> 13141.380000000001
actual [ __ ]

13138.04 --> 13144.319000000001
right and of course like the black death

13141.38 --> 13147.438999999998
and whatnot was exacerbated by our

13144.319 --> 13151.76
inability to properly take care of our

13147.439 --> 13153.5
waste right at that point yeah and I

13151.76 --> 13155.300000000001
mean a lot of times that's when people

13153.5 --> 13157.279
point to the the glory of modern

13155.3 --> 13158.899
medicine and say look at how much longer

13157.279 --> 13162.04
people are living it really is

13158.899 --> 13164.899
sanitation that's absolutely

13162.04 --> 13166.34
yeah it's also the reason that polio

13164.899 --> 13169.34
stopped

13166.34 --> 13171.14
what causes what's typically originally

13169.34 --> 13174.08
the cause of polio

13171.14 --> 13177.619999999999
uh it's polluted contaminated water

13174.08 --> 13181.399
right especially like with feces and

13177.62 --> 13183.380000000001
[ __ ] right but yeah get all that

13181.399 --> 13185.06
contamination out of there good sewer

13183.38 --> 13185.839999999998
system guess what nobody's gonna get it

13185.06 --> 13188.84
anymore

13185.84 --> 13190.880000000001
right except for by accident or somebody

13188.84 --> 13193.880000000001
like falling in poison or something

13190.88 --> 13195.92
right yeah and that's it it's not gonna

13193.88 --> 13198.199999999999
happen anymore but yeah that's they

13195.92 --> 13200.84
tricked us because

13198.2 --> 13203.42
as like as

13200.84 --> 13205.7
major industrial transitions happened

13203.42 --> 13208.460000000001
like building sewer systems everywhere

13205.7 --> 13211.220000000001
at the same time they came out oh we got

13208.46 --> 13212.899
a cure for polio but it's literally they

13211.22 --> 13216.278999999999
just shoehorned it in there and then

13212.899 --> 13220.34
claimed that that was the cause

13216.279 --> 13223.34
it's such a such a magician's trick it's

13220.34 --> 13225.439
just ridiculous yeah I mean always just

13223.34 --> 13227.84
it's always been mistaking correlation

13225.439 --> 13229.52
for causation and with polio that was

13227.84 --> 13232.7
one of my first

13229.52 --> 13234.979000000001
real when I was younger kind of like huh

13232.7 --> 13238.640000000001
moments is when I looked at the data

13234.979 --> 13241.039999999999
that showed how polio was really going

13238.64 --> 13243.439
down tremendously before the vaccine

13241.04 --> 13244.580000000002
even came out so

13243.439 --> 13246.739
yeah

13244.58 --> 13249.56
they they kind of picked a good time to

13246.739 --> 13252.199999999999
to unveil that at that point and

13249.56 --> 13255.019999999999
that really was about the start of our

13252.2 --> 13256.939
whole destination programs as far as

13255.02 --> 13258.979000000001
making them like mandatory and in

13256.939 --> 13261.02
schools and all that kind of stuff well

13258.979 --> 13262.938999999998
they were just looking for a good

13261.02 --> 13267.560000000001
background story

13262.939 --> 13269.779
and like logical consistent reasons that

13267.56 --> 13271.519999999999
that would convince people to just

13269.779 --> 13273.560000000001
inject things

13271.52 --> 13275.779
yeah

13273.56 --> 13277.819
yeah that's the reason that's really why

13275.779 --> 13280.220000000001
they developed all of it it was just so

13277.819 --> 13283.519999999999
they could normalize injecting stuff in

13280.22 --> 13285.858999999999
your body which is crazy to do that yes

13283.52 --> 13288.26
it's the most dangerous thing on average

13285.859 --> 13291.02
that you can do because you're bypassing

13288.26 --> 13293.899
all your security systems that way

13291.02 --> 13295.819000000001
super dangerous

13293.899 --> 13297.92
so that's what they try to normalize

13295.819 --> 13300.38
even though the entire thing was just

13297.92 --> 13303.08
flawed premise I mean cost postulate

13300.38 --> 13305.96
never was applied right it still isn't

13303.08 --> 13308.479
it just assumed that like oh bacteria

13305.96 --> 13311.3
well they've been proven to exert a

13308.479 --> 13313.278999999999
certain toxin or the certain toxin it

13311.3 --> 13315.38
seems to give symptoms that are

13313.279 --> 13316.880000000001
associated with the disease well that

13315.38 --> 13319.099999999999
means that the bacteria cause the

13316.88 --> 13321.319
disease but then they never actually

13319.1 --> 13323.960000000001
tested through experiment by isolating

13321.319 --> 13326.119999999999
the bacteria inserting it into a person

13323.96 --> 13328.099999999999
without other crap

13326.12 --> 13330.92
and then seeing Oh look he gets the

13328.1 --> 13333.859
disease yeah because it doesn't work

13330.92 --> 13335.899
because the bacteria don't cause it it's

13333.859 --> 13338.720000000001
the circumstances

13335.899 --> 13340.939
that arrive that will make the bacteria

13338.72 --> 13342.858999999999
cause the toxins that will give the

13340.939 --> 13345.02
disease they don't cause the disease

13342.859 --> 13348.26
they're actually there to fix the

13345.02 --> 13349.52
situation and have symptoms as side

13348.26 --> 13352.76
effects

13349.52 --> 13354.979000000001
but they're actually fixing things

13352.76 --> 13356.960000000001
all bacteria do that

13354.979 --> 13358.399
right yeah I I remember reading about

13356.96 --> 13361.839999999998
that a long time that's terrain Theory

13358.399 --> 13364.519999999999
Basics right away but right it's so true

13361.84 --> 13365.6
his microscope and all that kind of

13364.52 --> 13368.54
business

13365.6 --> 13372.08
right and just the fairy nature of life

13368.54 --> 13374.479000000001
like bacteria like we have bacteria in

13372.08 --> 13377.8
us they are so intrical in the part that

13374.479 --> 13381.858999999999
there's on a sub molecular or a sub

13377.8 --> 13384.14
cellular level they are integral it's

13381.859 --> 13386.300000000001
not just oh we have some bacteria on the

13384.14 --> 13388.3
size and we've been friends for several

13386.3 --> 13391.759999999998
Generations no no it's literally

13388.3 --> 13394.72
bacteria can transform

13391.76 --> 13398.66
right in plain side with a microscope

13394.72 --> 13402.438999999998
into a blood platelet and from a blood

13398.66 --> 13405.439
platelet into a fungi Spore and from A

13402.439 --> 13408.859
fungi Spore back into a bacteria

13405.439 --> 13411.92
etc etc they're the same unit

13408.859 --> 13415.34
they're literally a building block block

13411.92 --> 13418.34
of our body that can also transform into

13415.34 --> 13421.279
separate organisms that function sort of

13418.34 --> 13424.819
separately but they're literally

13421.279 --> 13428.300000000001
an integral biological part a building

13424.819 --> 13430.22
block of the body system itself

13428.3 --> 13432.56
and that's something that's just been

13430.22 --> 13433.76
ignored forever

13432.56 --> 13435.8
right

13433.76 --> 13438.62
if the entire medical system just

13435.8 --> 13440.899
ignores that completely

13438.62 --> 13443.660000000002
okay if it's not in their interest to do

13440.899 --> 13445.64
so and it's definitely in their interest

13443.66 --> 13447.92
to look at it in the reverse way but

13445.64 --> 13449.778999999999
like so many things like our cosmology

13447.92 --> 13452.54
and everything else this was hotly

13449.779 --> 13454.52
debated in the 19th century and

13452.54 --> 13458.239000000001
then it just kind of

13454.52 --> 13461.66
train theorists lost right they just

13458.239 --> 13463.699999999999
said no bacteria are external organisms

13461.66 --> 13466.279
they're not part of you but they you

13463.7 --> 13469.220000000001
have the menu some are beneficial and

13466.279 --> 13472.640000000001
they just they created this Rift

13469.22 --> 13474.438999999998
between a bacteria which is literally a

13472.64 --> 13477.14
thing that is a part of the building

13474.439 --> 13480.380000000001
blocks of how you work it's lit your

13477.14 --> 13482.72
blood is considerably all bacteria

13480.38 --> 13485.599999999999
like those are all bacteria that have

13482.72 --> 13488.06
been transformed and rearranged but

13485.6 --> 13490.76
they're there they're they are you

13488.06 --> 13493.119999999999
they're literally like part of your

13490.76 --> 13496.34
cells that's crazy

13493.12 --> 13497.720000000001
and they just created this Rift like

13496.34 --> 13500.06
they're always separate and then they're

13497.72 --> 13502.22
then you end up attacking the bacteria

13500.06 --> 13504.22
when they're literally your own freaking

13502.22 --> 13506.358999999999
building blocks

13504.22 --> 13510.019999999999
what the [ __ ]

13506.359 --> 13512.899000000001
right that's where they got us

13510.02 --> 13516.62
they got us to attack ourselves our

13512.899 --> 13519.92
biological things by creating a

13516.62 --> 13521.660000000002
fictional Rift like no this this one

13519.92 --> 13524.779
part of us that's actually an

13521.66 --> 13529.66
infiltrating enemy yes really

13524.779 --> 13529.66
now inject this poison for us

13529.76 --> 13533.479
right and it's always kind of a lot of

13532.04 --> 13536.6
the baby getting thrown out with the

13533.479 --> 13538.88
bathwater too because I think a lot of

13536.6 --> 13540.739
the opposite way of looking at it came

13538.88 --> 13543.619999999999
from like I mean people used to think

13540.739 --> 13548.0
that maggots came from inside the body

13543.62 --> 13550.279
like right so that's obviously not true

13548.0 --> 13552.319
but it goes along the same kind of

13550.279 --> 13554.12
concept so it's easy to kind of dismiss

13552.319 --> 13557.359
the rest of it when well that's even

13554.12 --> 13558.979000000001
more just rolling it in there thinking

13557.359 --> 13560.6
you're making a quick point but yeah

13558.979 --> 13562.64
there's some really weird [ __ ] with

13560.6 --> 13566.0
Alkali out there do you know that

13562.64 --> 13568.64
yeah that's like you're saying like yeah

13566.0 --> 13570.319
we just came from inside the body well

13568.64 --> 13572.3
science proved that of course that's not

13570.319 --> 13574.16
the case yeah but what if it actually is

13572.3 --> 13577.278999999999
though

13574.16 --> 13579.92
what if they do sometimes just manifest

13577.279 --> 13581.979000000001
when they shouldn't be able to

13579.92 --> 13585.979
weird Alchemy [ __ ]

13581.979 --> 13588.679999999998
did you hear like if you like

13585.979 --> 13590.358999999999
uh what is it kill a cow and then

13588.68 --> 13593.66
basically like

13590.359 --> 13595.04
keep it locked in a shed without any

13593.66 --> 13597.439
sunlight

13595.04 --> 13602.02
uh do something else then like

13597.439 --> 13602.02
eventually like bees come out of it

13602.239 --> 13608.72
interesting I'm not freaky

13605.3 --> 13610.46
like bees out of nowhere just come

13608.72 --> 13612.438999999998
crawling out of it

13610.46 --> 13615.64
wow what the [ __ ]

13612.439 --> 13619.04
like try to explain that biologist

13615.64 --> 13620.899
scientist what the [ __ ] right

13619.04 --> 13623.060000000001
there's weird [ __ ] out there and I've

13620.899 --> 13626.3
never personally tested it but there is

13623.06 --> 13628.46
there is absolutely something there

13626.3 --> 13631.819
and I think that even this trick of

13628.46 --> 13635.599999999999
creating bees out of dead cows that that

13631.819 --> 13639.979
used to be original farmer lore that

13635.6 --> 13641.779
they did that why because bees are good

13639.979 --> 13645.08
for pollination

13641.779 --> 13647.66
so they would sacrifice a cow to create

13645.08 --> 13649.939
bees to promote pollination

13647.66 --> 13653.479
right huh

13649.939 --> 13655.52
does that bring a couple of bells that's

13653.479 --> 13658.16
that make up a couple of puzzle pieces

13655.52 --> 13660.380000000001
suddenly fit perfectly where before they

13658.16 --> 13663.14
were just weird superstition

13660.38 --> 13665.72
right right if maybe there is a point to

13663.14 --> 13668.599999999999
sacrifice maybe they did it for that

13665.72 --> 13671.899
right yeah that's actually a lot to

13668.6 --> 13674.18
think about right there I mean a lot of

13671.899 --> 13676.76
it's getting over and as I I just fell

13674.18 --> 13678.979000000001
victim to it right there too is is what

13676.76 --> 13682.18
we consider to be even weird but if you

13678.979 --> 13685.819
just take it kind of on its elements why

13682.18 --> 13687.92
why could not why would it be impossible

13685.819 --> 13690.56
for something to manifest itself that

13687.92 --> 13691.479
way we we obviously can create all kinds

13690.56 --> 13694.76
of

13691.479 --> 13696.979
biological structures naturally it can't

13694.76 --> 13701.12
work it's not so absurd Well it can't

13696.979 --> 13705.14
work if we are gonna go by the official

13701.12 --> 13706.76
idea of genetics sure because then a

13705.14 --> 13709.039999999999
completely different set of genetics

13706.76 --> 13711.26
couldn't just manifest out of nowhere

13709.04 --> 13715.1
out of another group of genetics right

13711.26 --> 13719.12
right but apparently that does happen

13715.1 --> 13721.7
there is spontaneous life transmutation

13719.12 --> 13724.399000000001
apparently possible

13721.7 --> 13726.26
it's really freaky and it's even like

13724.399 --> 13729.8
possible apparently to like create

13726.26 --> 13731.960000000001
insects out of non-living matter

13729.8 --> 13734.599999999999
using electricity

13731.96 --> 13736.819
it's really [ __ ] weird

13734.6 --> 13738.800000000001
that right there's somebody like [ __ ]

13736.819 --> 13741.8
around with electricity high voltage

13738.8 --> 13744.259999999998
stuff and then literally they had

13741.8 --> 13748.278999999999
like visually it would keep happening

13744.26 --> 13749.359
that a might would literally form out of

13748.279 --> 13752.84
thin air

13749.359 --> 13752.84
right what

13755.779 --> 13761.66
super freaky yeah I'm referencing by the

13758.899 --> 13764.899
way now to the big homunculus video from

13761.66 --> 13767.539999999999
uh mind unveiled which is like where

13764.899 --> 13770.66
they he did research to that and he

13767.54 --> 13772.460000000001
shows it like the the photography of

13770.66 --> 13775.34
actual tests that have been done and

13772.46 --> 13777.08
[ __ ] so freaky

13775.34 --> 13779.6
interesting I'll have to check that out

13777.08 --> 13784.279
I I've talked to mind unveiling

13779.6 --> 13786.02
really yeah on his Discord wow I didn't

13784.279 --> 13789.819000000001
even know that I didn't even know he had

13786.02 --> 13792.5
a Discord yeah that is very cool

13789.819 --> 13795.56
I didn't know you knew him

13792.5 --> 13798.62
he's Epic Man his videos are like the

13795.56 --> 13801.319
best the best occulted videos I've ever

13798.62 --> 13803.720000000001
come across ever yeah he was he was

13801.319 --> 13805.0
interested in hearing my uh backstory to

13803.72 --> 13807.38
what happened to

13805.0 --> 13809.779
stalinhistory.org to the best of my

13807.38 --> 13811.519999999999
knowledge and that's that's a whole I

13809.779 --> 13815.060000000001
don't even want to get into that that's

13811.52 --> 13817.279
a long and convoluted tale but

13815.06 --> 13819.14
definitely some weird games going on and

13817.279 --> 13821.359
that that dovetails with the concave

13819.14 --> 13824.96
earthers too like

13821.359 --> 13827.359
and and uh what's the other guy the the

13824.96 --> 13830.479
guy who did the history of the Flat

13827.359 --> 13830.479000000001
Earth videos

13830.68 --> 13835.819
okay and you're not talking about Mark

13833.42 --> 13839.62
Sergeant right no not not Mark Sergeant

13835.819 --> 13842.84
uh the more recent he did the the big

13839.62 --> 13844.76
uh gosh what's the guy's name is gonna

13842.84 --> 13848.6
bug me now but there's something

13844.76 --> 13850.1
suspicious about him too but I I have

13848.6 --> 13851.84
all this written down somewhere and I'd

13850.1 --> 13854.479000000001
hate to just kind of go off half cocked

13851.84 --> 13856.58
about it is the guy he he has a I think

13854.479 --> 13858.5
he's possibly Russian

13856.58 --> 13860.72
he

13858.5 --> 13862.52
he was popular for a minute his videos

13860.72 --> 13863.96
Incorporated a lot of the mud flood

13862.52 --> 13866.0
stuff he was kind of trying to make a

13863.96 --> 13868.759999999998
total kind of

13866.0 --> 13871.04
uh totality video oh somebody here in

13868.76 --> 13873.859
chat says hey I War

13871.04 --> 13876.439
yes you got it thank you a war thanks

13873.859 --> 13878.779
fiber oats yes

13876.439 --> 13882.5
that's that's the guy

13878.779 --> 13885.220000000001
oh he says it's a shield he says

13882.5 --> 13888.92
yeah he has some relationship to the new

13885.22 --> 13890.778999999999
stolenhistory.net and they went and

13888.92 --> 13893.239
there was a whole group of people that

13890.779 --> 13894.92
were trying to dox Corbin Dallas who was

13893.239 --> 13897.02
the founder of the original stolen

13894.92 --> 13900.14
history like it's a big it's a big

13897.02 --> 13902.54

comment after the show's end because I

13936.979 --> 13940.76
am going to maneuver towards routing it

13938.66 --> 13941.859
we've been going for three hours and 50

13940.76 --> 13947.02
minutes

13941.859 --> 13947.02
right she's getting a bit pathological

13947.12 --> 13951.92
but great though I love to have you on

13949.819 --> 13953.72
more often do this

13951.92 --> 13955.88
oh yeah no there's been a there's been a

13953.72 --> 13958.699999999999
great time and now that I've uh

13955.88 --> 13961.16
broken my cherry so to speak I I think

13958.7 --> 13962.479000000001
I'm more comfortable doing this now so

13961.16 --> 13964.16
awesome

13962.479 --> 13966.019999999999
I hope everybody in Chad has been

13964.16 --> 13968.3
enjoying let me just address the chat

13966.02 --> 13970.399000000001
for like the first time in two hours is

13968.3 --> 13972.438999999998
everybody in the chat actually enjoying

13970.399 --> 13974.239
this conversation is it can you follow

13972.439 --> 13977.300000000001
it

13974.239 --> 13979.88
like are you guys actually following

13977.3 --> 13981.438999999998
our conversation because you'd seem to

13979.88 --> 13983.119999999999
be chatting back and forth with each

13981.439 --> 13986.42
other a lot

13983.12 --> 13989.08
it's been a great show thanks Richard G

13986.42 --> 13989.08
awesome

13991.22 --> 13994.119999999999
thanks

13994.279 --> 14000.399000000001
right so yeah it looks like it's been a

13997.64 --> 14002.199999999999
success so far

14000.399 --> 14004.739
and I feel so too it's been a great

14002.2 --> 14004.739000000001
conversation

14004.779 --> 14010.26
are you still there yeah great oh yeah

14007.42 --> 14010.26
you were silent

14010.479 --> 14015.099999999999
all right

14012.16 --> 14018.16
uh but yeah that's no it's been

14015.1 --> 14020.140000000001
absolutely fantastic and Float float

14018.16 --> 14021.819
really naturally too I'm I'm happy about

14020.14 --> 14024.699999999999
that I know it might have been a bit all

14021.819 --> 14027.399
over the place for for people but uh I I

14024.7 --> 14029.739000000001
think it made sense anyway yeah yeah and

14027.399 --> 14031.06
we've also managed to not rumpus the

14029.739 --> 14033.64
[ __ ] out of each other by accident

14031.06 --> 14035.38
because when you're both enthusiastic

14033.64 --> 14037.68
that can also happen and I think that

14035.38 --> 14041.979
we've been it's been pretty

14037.68 --> 14045.880000000001
uh comprehensible so far for everybody

14041.979 --> 14048.039999999999
yeah that I I I count my uh again I

14045.88 --> 14050.56
spent most of my adult career and

14048.04 --> 14053.380000000001
customer service so I'm pretty good at

14050.56 --> 14055.359
letting people go and then try because

14053.38 --> 14057.699999999999
you're not supposed to cut people off on

14055.359 --> 14060.220000000001
the phone of course so right

14057.7 --> 14062.02
yeah no it's it's a difficult thing for

14060.22 --> 14064.3
a lot of people I've had plenty of

14062.02 --> 14067.359
training with fed

14064.3 --> 14069.399
but yeah because once you get going it's

14067.359 --> 14071.140000000001
like once it starts rolling out a lot of

14069.399 --> 14073.899
people like they can't stop until it's

14071.14 --> 14075.698999999999
rolled out yeah but that can become very

14073.899 --> 14076.84
clunky in in back and forth

14075.699 --> 14079.960000000001
conversations

14076.84 --> 14082.06
right it's been great so far and well I

14079.96 --> 14085.179999999998
forbid a training anti-rumpus training

14082.06 --> 14087.76
and you very much have it so it's been

14085.18 --> 14091.42
super fluid it's been great

14087.76 --> 14093.52
I love it let's definitely do it again

14091.42 --> 14095.439
another key along that is sometimes you

14093.52 --> 14097.779
have to let points go that you really

14095.439 --> 14099.460000000001
want to say yeah but I think that's what

14097.779 --> 14101.26
trips up people sometimes is they have

14099.46 --> 14103.72
such a good thought and they want to get

14101.26 --> 14105.279
to it but right but that's because they

14103.72 --> 14107.019999999999
think they're understanding something

14105.279 --> 14109.0
for the first time and then they're like

14107.02 --> 14111.58
afraid that it'll if they forget about

14109.0 --> 14114.1
it that it's all gone but that never

14111.58 --> 14116.38
actually happens because if the same

14114.1 --> 14118.960000000001
situation arrives again you get the

14116.38 --> 14121.96
exact same idea in the same way because

14118.96 --> 14124.179999999998
that's how it works and I've learned

14121.96 --> 14126.039999999999
that like a long time ago just never be

14124.18 --> 14129.220000000001
afraid that your ideas are lost because

14126.04 --> 14131.199
they can't be lost right because if the

14129.22 --> 14133.479
same thing happens the same situation

14131.199 --> 14136.779
arrives the same ideas will come back

14133.479 --> 14139.479
because that's how memory works

14136.779 --> 14143.08
sure it's like the frequency brings

14139.479 --> 14145.119999999999
Associated memories and ideas with them

14143.08 --> 14147.88
it's like oh you get to a certain

14145.12 --> 14149.979000000001
mindset oh guess what you reinvent the

14147.88 --> 14151.899
same idea that you might even forgotten

14149.979 --> 14152.679999999998
that you've already figured that out one

14151.899 --> 14154.96
time

14152.68 --> 14157.54
but then it went away you forget about

14154.96 --> 14160.06
it the same situation arrive it's like

14157.54 --> 14161.68
whoa this idea and somebody that might

14160.06 --> 14163.778999999999
have remembered will tell you like uh

14161.68 --> 14167.26
that's literally what you said the last

14163.779 --> 14169.140000000001
time this happened wait really yeah yeah

14167.26 --> 14170.979
it's literally that

14169.14 --> 14172.72
happens

14170.979 --> 14174.819
to me too

14172.72 --> 14177.22
I think that's a little bit of a

14174.819 --> 14178.6
Stoner mentality too you know you have

14177.22 --> 14180.519999999999
your great ideas when you when you're

14178.6 --> 14182.92
high and then you sober up and you're

14180.52 --> 14184.66
like [ __ ] I don't remember what that was

14182.92 --> 14186.04
yeah you don't remember the the

14184.66 --> 14188.199
structure you don't remember the

14186.04 --> 14189.699
oversight your memory was there but you

14188.199 --> 14190.84
don't have a grip on it anymore that

14189.699 --> 14193.140000000001
happens a lot

14190.84 --> 14196.479
yeah to people

14193.14 --> 14198.34
I'm lucky not to really it's because I

14196.479 --> 14200.38
just stopped

14198.34 --> 14202.66
thinking about it like that and really

14200.38 --> 14205.66
like no you can never forget anything

14202.66 --> 14209.319
even if you wanted to and then just

14205.66 --> 14210.119999999999
think or look at myself and

14209.319 --> 14212.319
and

14210.12 --> 14215.02
understanding and Consciousness itself

14212.319 --> 14216.939
like that and then it all just starts

14215.02 --> 14217.720000000001
working better I just

14216.939 --> 14220.06
yeah

14217.72 --> 14221.979
I don't have issues it's only like

14220.06 --> 14223.96
trying to remember names or something

14221.979 --> 14226.599999999999
that's really the last thing that's that

14223.96 --> 14228.399
that I have trouble with cognitively but

14226.6 --> 14231.16
the rest it's all super fluid and it's

14228.399 --> 14234.22
like ideas just come back to me

14231.16 --> 14236.14
yeah I'm just never worried again that

14234.22 --> 14238.979
I'm gonna forget something and if it's

14236.14 --> 14242.14
that urgent if it's so incredibly urgent

14238.979 --> 14244.239
because I happen to be really high or

14242.14 --> 14246.039999999999
whatever it does happen sometimes that I

14244.239 --> 14248.198999999999
just exit I get high and then something

14246.04 --> 14250.060000000001
really interesting happens yeah the same

14248.199 --> 14251.68
effect happened but if it's so important

14250.06 --> 14253.66
then I'll make a note

14251.68 --> 14255.460000000001
and then an hour later I'll look at the

14253.66 --> 14257.38
note and see if it was actually worth it

14255.46 --> 14260.56
right

14257.38 --> 14264.278999999999
yeah that's a pretty uh bad success

14260.56 --> 14265.778999999999
ratio and my my experience exactly it

14264.279 --> 14267.04
turns out that the most of the time when

14265.779 --> 14268.899000000001
you get really high you thought

14267.04 --> 14270.52
something was a really good idea it was

14268.899 --> 14273.18
just a moderate idea

14270.52 --> 14273.18
yep

14274.18 --> 14278.92
thank God that I found that out like

14276.819 --> 14282.16
halfway my life and up at the end of my

14278.92 --> 14284.859
life right

14282.16 --> 14288.399
as with anything like with that it's uh

14284.859 --> 14291.279
important to take breaks from it I think

14288.399 --> 14293.26
I think it's good to defrag every once

14291.279 --> 14295.54
in a while as I call it like I I

14293.26 --> 14297.939
sometimes think of marijuana as a

14295.54 --> 14300.52
natural defragmentation device for for

14297.939 --> 14303.460000000001
your brain right I mean to a lesser

14300.52 --> 14305.859
degree than like harder hallucinogenics

14303.46 --> 14309.399
which you can get the same effect faster

14305.859 --> 14312.58
but also with its own series of issues

14309.399 --> 14314.92
yeah yeah I'm not trying that I like

14312.58 --> 14316.899
I've done the head that stuff it's so

14314.92 --> 14319.12
much dramatic impact on my life it's

14316.899 --> 14322.0
just I'm not doing that again I

14319.12 --> 14324.160000000002
I could I mean they got all kinds of

14322.0 --> 14327.399
weird hallucinogenic [ __ ] just in the

14324.16 --> 14329.8
stores here and I'm like oh oh okay it's

14327.399 --> 14333.58
the new LSD is it uh

14329.8 --> 14335.92
yeah that's really cool I'm just gonna

14333.58 --> 14339.58
stick to weed that's already quite

14335.92 --> 14342.399
impactful enough as it is yeah but uh

14339.58 --> 14346.42
yeah it's a young man's game all of that

14342.399 --> 14349.3
for sure I'm too old at this point I'm

14346.42 --> 14352.06
just well yeah a friend who was a

14349.3 --> 14353.8
chemist too and he he was really into

14352.06 --> 14356.439
going into all the different uh

14353.8 --> 14358.358999999999
deviations from LSD and things that were

14356.439 --> 14361.12
just a couple molecules off and whatnot

14358.359 --> 14363.880000000001
and I had to flavor a few of his

14361.12 --> 14367.42
products and they they were interesting

14363.88 --> 14370.66
but uh I don't know I I don't personally

14367.42 --> 14371.8
trust uh LSD at this point I think that

14370.66 --> 14375.58
there's something wrong with that

14371.8 --> 14377.14
there's something you know the pins you

14375.58 --> 14380.439
know you have there's so many different

14377.14 --> 14382.899
forms like basic LSD is really reliable

14380.439 --> 14385.12
it's super stable the problem is is that

14382.899 --> 14387.46
there's so many things you can do with

14385.12 --> 14390.460000000001
it that will start to like have like

14387.46 --> 14393.339999999998
bizarre influences like including like

14390.46 --> 14395.679999999998
make you susceptible to Demons that will

14393.34 --> 14398.26
start [ __ ] with you like you can make

14395.68 --> 14400.960000000001
it to become vulnerable to that or to be

14398.26 --> 14403.899
impervious to that like there's so much

14400.96 --> 14406.778999999999
bizarre development with LSD thanks to

14403.899 --> 14408.278999999999
the CIA mostly who did all that research

14406.779 --> 14410.560000000001
God

14408.279 --> 14412.300000000001
right putting people in chairs giving

14410.56 --> 14415.06
them that [ __ ] and then hearing them out

14412.3 --> 14417.099999999999
right

14415.06 --> 14419.8
it's really any anything you can use as

14417.1 --> 14422.199
a tool to to quote again like as I told

14419.8 --> 14424.599999999999
you I I like Carlos castaneta and his

14422.199 --> 14426.939
Don Juan books one of the phrases that

14424.6 --> 14429.04
he uses is to describe what you're

14426.939 --> 14430.84
trying to accomplish with things like

14429.04 --> 14433.060000000001
that is it he calls it stopping the

14430.84 --> 14435.399
world uh which I think is a pretty good

14433.06 --> 14437.019999999999
way of putting it and like you can

14435.399 --> 14438.698999999999
really use I mean it doesn't even have

14437.02 --> 14440.560000000001
to be drug related anything that

14438.699 --> 14442.960000000001
basically prevents you out of your

14440.56 --> 14444.698999999999
ordinary cycle of activity and and

14442.96 --> 14447.899
allows you to re-engage with everything

14444.699 --> 14447.899000000001
fresh is good

14448.979 --> 14454.72
when I was telling you I had a pretty

14451.66 --> 14457.359
big when I was younger uh here where I

14454.72 --> 14461.319
was experiencing Deja Vu like very

14457.359 --> 14463.42
strong Deja Vu for months and uh the the

14461.319 --> 14467.019999999999
Catalyst to that of all things was

14463.42 --> 14470.38
actually cocaine strangely enough like

14467.02 --> 14472.18
which which doesn't seem to like that

14470.38 --> 14474.22
wouldn't ordinarily track I wouldn't

14472.18 --> 14478.239
think but it's again it just you're

14474.22 --> 14480.88
altering your chemical uh your usual

14478.239 --> 14482.5
chemical modes of of thinking and

14480.88 --> 14485.019999999999
replacing it with something else and

14482.5 --> 14487.3
that's how you can reconceptualize

14485.02 --> 14489.939
everything right it does more than that

14487.3 --> 14492.519999999999
though because those types of drugs

14489.939 --> 14494.319
actually influence your like physical

14492.52 --> 14497.92
chemistry

14494.319 --> 14499.899
yeah so that's why like I really stuck

14497.92 --> 14501.58
to Canada because I know like once you

14499.899 --> 14504.519999999999
start taking those things and experiment

14501.58 --> 14507.22
like you can never unchange back you'll

14504.52 --> 14510.1
never be the old version you don't know

14507.22 --> 14512.619999999999
what it all does the more combinations

14510.1 --> 14516.220000000001
of things you take like that hard drives

14512.62 --> 14517.6
like it changes your physiology

14516.22 --> 14520.539999999999
and

14517.6 --> 14523.6
like there's relatively little known

14520.54 --> 14526.6
even about how that works it's just

14523.6 --> 14528.58
palpable like compounded drug users like

14526.6 --> 14531.16
you really start to see that on them

14528.58 --> 14534.399
when they get older

14531.16 --> 14536.56
and yeah I'm I've always stayed away

14534.399 --> 14538.96
from that

14536.56 --> 14541.6
yeah probably a wise move I never really

14538.96 --> 14544.5
was into it too deeply at any point in

14541.6 --> 14548.319
my life because I could always

14544.5 --> 14551.62
physically feel it killing me like right

14548.319 --> 14554.198999999999
I could tell yeah

14551.62 --> 14557.319000000001
yeah yeah I even had that with the

14554.199 --> 14560.02
freaking LSD or DMT whatever that was

14557.319 --> 14562.119999999999
sure like when I got it before I

14560.02 --> 14564.699
basically went into the tunnel in the

14562.12 --> 14566.800000000001
dark world I could literally feel it

14564.699 --> 14568.84
just physically hurting me it's like

14566.8 --> 14575.38
this hurts

14568.84 --> 14577.239
right like ow pain grief so weird

14575.38 --> 14578.8
that that would literally make me feel

14577.239 --> 14581.14
that

14578.8 --> 14585.34
one of the worst things that I felt that

14581.14 --> 14587.56
feeling with was Adderall yeah and like

14585.34 --> 14591.399
just recreational Adderall I wasn't like

14587.56 --> 14593.8
on it but like that's it was shocking to

14591.399 --> 14597.46
me and I'd be like they give this to

14593.8 --> 14601.3
children oh my gosh crazy yeah it's

14597.46 --> 14603.819
ridiculous yeah well math is like super

14601.3 --> 14606.58
dangerous or is that Adderall was that

14603.819 --> 14608.619999999999
yes Adderall is essentially enough yeah

14606.58 --> 14610.359
I mean I think a chemist would argue

14608.62 --> 14611.979000000001
with me about that but yeah it's just a

14610.359 --> 14616.18
brand name right but everybody calls it

14611.979 --> 14619.239
that but yeah it is math and math is

14616.18 --> 14621.76
very dangerous stuff yeah it's Baby's

14619.239 --> 14624.16
introductions enough it's crazy because

14621.76 --> 14626.68
most meth people like start to

14624.16 --> 14630.34
hallucinate like weird [ __ ] up demon

14626.68 --> 14632.56
[ __ ] right and to give that to kids is

14630.34 --> 14636.699
absolutely insane

14632.56 --> 14640.84
when they're so vulnerable I mean

14636.699 --> 14643.239000000001
I'm so glad that I like I was sort of uh

14640.84 --> 14646.54
classified as hyperactive when I was

14643.239 --> 14648.22
younger and they tried to put me on that

14646.54 --> 14650.800000000001
but my parents

14648.22 --> 14653.08
basically said no to that and I'm so

14650.8 --> 14655.0
glad that they did they were just like

14653.08 --> 14657.16
no you're just gonna have to learn to

14655.0 --> 14658.66
control it it's like okay challenge

14657.16 --> 14660.819
accepted

14658.66 --> 14662.26
like at least you're not just angry at

14660.819 --> 14663.278999999999
me for being like that

14662.26 --> 14667.84
so

14663.279 --> 14669.960000000001
right I'm glad that I never had it ever

14667.84 --> 14673.0
a lot of times it's just natural

14669.96 --> 14674.619999999999
techniques for learning like yeah I I

14673.0 --> 14676.6
said at the example the other day but

14674.62 --> 14678.52
it's always a big one for me I After

14676.6 --> 14681.279
High School I went to college for a year

14678.52 --> 14683.02
I dropped out and I ended up going to

14681.279 --> 14685.66
the doctor and they're like are you

14683.02 --> 14687.04
depressed and I'm like yeah on occasion

14685.66 --> 14689.439
and they wanted to prescribe something

14687.04 --> 14692.68
to me and even at that time I just kept

14689.439 --> 14694.66
on thinking why should I not be a little

14692.68 --> 14697.12
bit depressed I'm literally not doing

14694.66 --> 14700.18
anything with my life right now isn't

14697.12 --> 14703.060000000001
that a natural consequence right and

14700.18 --> 14705.04
like is it absolutely inevitable that

14703.06 --> 14707.56
you're never gonna get out of it or have

14705.04 --> 14710.080000000002
to have the signs presented themselves

14707.56 --> 14712.479
like oh [ __ ] I'm stuck I can't get out

14710.08 --> 14714.46
of this or is it just like no this is

14712.479 --> 14715.42
just a shitty period I'll get out of

14714.46 --> 14717.64
this

14715.42 --> 14720.64
you know right right and that's always a

14717.64 --> 14722.619999999999
fine distinction too I I would suspect

14720.64 --> 14725.619999999999
that there are people that have an

14722.62 --> 14727.18
innate chemical imbalance that you know

14725.62 --> 14730.0
chronic depression they just keep

14727.18 --> 14731.92
falling back in wrong mindsets that's

14730.0 --> 14733.72
usually the people that get like

14731.92 --> 14735.460000000001
permanent drug addictions

14733.72 --> 14737.08
right because they can't control their

14735.46 --> 14739.899
own mindset they keep switching to

14737.08 --> 14742.06
things that they don't want to

14739.899 --> 14744.939
now I agree with that too I I think

14742.06 --> 14747.039999999999
ultimately it's not it's a lack of

14744.939 --> 14750.460000000001
self-accountability with almost anything

14747.04 --> 14753.04
like you could play with everything but

14750.46 --> 14755.438999999998
I do think for some people it may get to

14753.04 --> 14758.62
the point that it's not really realistic

14755.439 --> 14761.14
to expect them to overcome it and then

14758.62 --> 14763.660000000002
maybe some chemical intervention could

14761.14 --> 14766.899
be possibly helpful right but there's

14763.66 --> 14767.979
just symptom like yeah I mean it

14766.899 --> 14769.739
absolutely is

14767.979 --> 14772.3
but

14769.739 --> 14774.64
they'd fill the pain box from Doom

14772.3 --> 14777.22
because they are literally just

14774.64 --> 14778.3
internally driven by impulses that they

14777.22 --> 14781.06
can't control

14778.3 --> 14783.16
right right I guess that's the question

14781.06 --> 14787.119999999999
though is can't control or won't control

14783.16 --> 14789.279
you know doesn't matter if you can't or

14787.12 --> 14790.359
you won't does it matter they're not

14789.279 --> 14793.0
doing it

14790.359 --> 14795.76
right the the biggest thing to me though

14793.0 --> 14798.76
is obviously the the level of people

14795.76 --> 14801.22
that that's applicable to is magnitudes

14798.76 --> 14803.62
lower than the level than the level of

14801.22 --> 14805.3
people that are prescribed these things

14803.62 --> 14809.380000000001
well there's a lot of people that are

14805.3 --> 14812.38
just playing victims to get drugs

14809.38 --> 14814.06
oh right yeah it's like oh I have this I

14812.38 --> 14816.22
want some medication and it's just like

14814.06 --> 14820.18
yeah they're just browsing for their

14816.22 --> 14822.46
drugs like oh I like the anti-anxiety

14820.18 --> 14826.26
drugs well then I'm gonna have anxiety

14822.46 --> 14826.259999999998
issues so that I get these drugs

14826.5 --> 14832.239
it's crazy though it's really bad that

14829.899 --> 14833.319
that's happened and that's happening so

14832.239 --> 14836.68
much

14833.319 --> 14840.46
like a lot of a lot of new generations

14836.68 --> 14843.819
like when they like get to the teenage

14840.46 --> 14848.38
and Beyond in their 20s and they'd like

14843.819 --> 14851.198999999999
get super pharmaceutical drug addicted

14848.38 --> 14853.539999999999
and they yeah they never really recover

14851.199 --> 14856.0
from that from what I've seen

14853.54 --> 14857.800000000001
yeah for sure and well like you said

14856.0 --> 14860.199
there's sometimes you can't you can't

14857.8 --> 14863.8
unring the Bell but uh

14860.199 --> 14865.62
yeah with with certain people it's it is

14863.8 --> 14868.119999999999
funny though that there's still

14865.62 --> 14869.800000000001
anti-depression anti-anxiety all that

14868.12 --> 14872.859
stuff they still give away like candy

14869.8 --> 14875.739
but in in this country anyway they

14872.859 --> 14878.199
really have cracked down on on opioids a

14875.739 --> 14880.899
ton like people that go through intense

14878.199 --> 14883.84
surgery have a hard time getting harder

14880.899 --> 14887.56
opioids because of the reaction to the

14883.84 --> 14889.72
over prescribing them for for so long

14887.56 --> 14891.519999999999
right which is unfortunate and there's a

14889.72 --> 14893.08
fentanyl crisis too you have a practical

14891.52 --> 14894.279
application

14893.08 --> 14896.68
so

14894.279 --> 14899.5
yeah of course emergency but I mean

14896.68 --> 14901.720000000001
there's a giant fentanyl crisis in the

14899.5 --> 14903.939
U.S now gigantic

14901.72 --> 14906.099999999999
yeah I mean I think the fentanyl crisis

14903.939 --> 14908.56
is directly related to the fact that

14906.1 --> 14911.199
doctors are being so stricter with their

14908.56 --> 14913.778999999999
and it always comes back to people are

14911.199 --> 14915.880000000001
gonna find it no matter what and when

14913.779 --> 14917.560000000001
you make it harder to find the ones that

14915.88 --> 14920.319
at least you know are more chemically

14917.56 --> 14922.42
set they're going to go to the ones that

14920.319 --> 14924.698999999999
aren't and then it exacerbates the whole

14922.42 --> 14926.38
thing yeah and and the fun or the funny

14924.699 --> 14930.16
it's not funny but the thing about

14926.38 --> 14932.198999999999
fentanyl is it's just too dangerous

14930.16 --> 14935.38
the stuff is because

14932.199 --> 14937.300000000001
it's so easy to overdose and like they

14935.38 --> 14940.3
even have to be super careful with the

14937.3 --> 14942.88
very the making the stuff it's like a

14940.3 --> 14944.14
pill it has a couple of molecules of

14942.88 --> 14946.539999999999
that stuff in there and the rest is

14944.14 --> 14947.739
filler but you don't know that by

14946.54 --> 14951.699
default

14947.739 --> 14954.88
right or you could like oh get a bit

14951.699 --> 14957.880000000001
woozy and then take it a second time and

14954.88 --> 14959.8
then you're [ __ ] dead just for by

14957.88 --> 14961.839999999998
accident taking it a second time like

14959.8 --> 14965.739
that's not a tenable drug

14961.84 --> 14967.92
it isn't no it's it's too dangerous like

14965.739 --> 14972.22
it would be better to just have

14967.92 --> 14973.779
methadone or something more basic even

14972.22 --> 14976.179999999998
though it might have all these artifacts

14973.779 --> 14978.880000000001
because at least you're not just easily

14976.18 --> 14982.66
gonna accidentally kill yourself with it

14978.88 --> 14984.88
because you take it a second time like

14982.66 --> 14986.92
that doesn't help work with those other

14984.88 --> 14990.278999999999
drugs

14986.92 --> 14991.72
I've done lots of methadone destroys

14990.279 --> 14993.460000000001
Community hold on let me address the

14991.72 --> 14996.22
chat yeah Richard I'm not saying it's

14993.46 --> 14997.539999999999
good it's terrible but the point is with

14996.22 --> 15000.84
methadone

14997.54 --> 15005.1
uh just just compare the amount of

15000.84 --> 15007.14
Overdose deaths of methadone addicts the

15005.1 --> 15010.380000000001
people that aren't even addicts dying

15007.14 --> 15014.42
from Fentanyl I swear that the method

15010.38 --> 15016.979
methadone yeah it exists but compared to

15014.42 --> 15018.56
fentanyl I mean fentanyl has had like

15016.979 --> 15021.96
the record

15018.56 --> 15023.76
overdose deaths of perhaps all drugs in

15021.96 --> 15025.5
history at this point

15023.76 --> 15027.54
right there's so many people

15025.5 --> 15029.239
accidentally dying from that [ __ ] it's

15027.54 --> 15032.220000000001
surreal

15029.239 --> 15034.76
right and again it's definitely I

15032.22 --> 15038.88
totally it's not to defend any kind of

15034.76 --> 15041.1
the Pharma companies are making it's

15038.88 --> 15043.5
that at least there is some level of

15041.1 --> 15046.5
quality control that goes on there and

15043.5 --> 15048.3
you buy anything off the street yeah you

15046.5 --> 15051.479
trying to buy hydrocodone or something

15048.3 --> 15054.84
it might be fentanyl like I think years

15051.479 --> 15058.26
ago I had fentanyl by accident and it

15054.84 --> 15062.04
wasn't pleasant no I can imagine

15058.26 --> 15064.319
and super risky too yeah and I wasn't

15062.04 --> 15067.140000000001
trying to buy it but I just got it I'm

15064.319 --> 15070.08
pretty sure so you've been lucky then

15067.14 --> 15071.939
okay I'm not trying anything like that

15070.08 --> 15075.479
anymore like that's why I've said like

15071.939 --> 15078.18
I'm not taking pain medications like

15075.479 --> 15080.58
pretty much under any circumstance like

15078.18 --> 15082.56
unless like my leg was often an accident

15080.58 --> 15084.3
and they will win this in the hospital

15082.56 --> 15087.06
yeah they're gonna

15084.3 --> 15090.539999999999
give me something I'll not stop them

15087.06 --> 15092.819
but as soon as I am out of the care of

15090.54 --> 15094.979000000001
any doctor or Hospital like I'm like

15092.819 --> 15097.08
yeah that's that's cute I'm Gonna Learn

15094.979 --> 15099.3
and live with this pain

15097.08 --> 15101.039999999999
that's my mission

15099.3 --> 15102.479
I'm gonna figure out how to learn to

15101.04 --> 15105.239000000001
live with it and I've done that with

15102.479 --> 15107.698999999999
every form of pain I've ever had since I

15105.239 --> 15111.0
decided that and it's all worked

15107.699 --> 15114.239000000001
like I've certain things that would like

15111.0 --> 15116.819
make people experience pain to the point

15114.239 --> 15120.0
where they would faint

15116.819 --> 15121.859
I've gone through that and now like it

15120.0 --> 15125.1
just doesn't hurt anymore I will feel

15121.859 --> 15126.66
like oh there's wrong here but I it's

15125.1 --> 15129.239
not like

15126.66 --> 15131.88
because I'm like yeah yeah it hurts but

15129.239 --> 15134.58
I'm used to it it's like yeah the pain

15131.88 --> 15138.42
is just not as painful to me anymore

15134.58 --> 15140.64
right and like that doesn't stop like

15138.42 --> 15142.439
that's permanent

15140.64 --> 15146.0
I think that's right just pain just

15142.439 --> 15146.0
doesn't hurt me anymore as much

15146.88 --> 15151.739
yeah I think that's the right approach I

15148.8 --> 15154.019999999999
think I find sometimes that the thoughts

15151.739 --> 15155.58
that I had when I was younger are better

15154.02 --> 15157.800000000001
than the thoughts that I grew into and

15155.58 --> 15160.56
then I kind of go back to back to my

15157.8 --> 15164.0
original premise like I I always knew

15160.56 --> 15166.859
that we have everything that we need

15164.0 --> 15168.479
naturally for the most part

15166.859 --> 15171.720000000001
um and

15168.479 --> 15174.179999999998
I I was pretty straight edge or so you'd

15171.72 --> 15176.58
call it during like my teenage years and

15174.18 --> 15179.52
then like I kind of fell off the wagon a

15176.58 --> 15181.38
bit in my 20s and now now I realize

15179.52 --> 15183.12
again that like I I was right on to

15181.38 --> 15186.358999999999
begin with I never should have gone down

15183.12 --> 15189.720000000001
that path but as far as people with like

15186.359 --> 15191.460000000001
pain tolerance goes I mean it's kind of

15189.72 --> 15193.5
the same issue that it is with emotional

15191.46 --> 15196.08
tolerance in our culture right exactly

15193.5 --> 15198.479
yeah if you if you've if you think of

15196.08 --> 15200.279
yourself as I can tolerate pain well

15198.479 --> 15203.58
guess what it's gonna get worse and

15200.279 --> 15205.26
worse and worse you're gonna have more

15203.58 --> 15207.12
pain issue it's going to shock you even

15205.26 --> 15209.34
more and eventually it'll get so bad to

15207.12 --> 15211.140000000001
the point where somebody just Pricks you

15209.34 --> 15213.66
with their nail and you'll just have a

15211.14 --> 15216.3
spaz attack yeah because that's what

15213.66 --> 15219.119999999999
happens when you fear pain and when you

15216.3 --> 15222.42
have this mindset of expectancy of being

15219.12 --> 15225.300000000001
tortured by pain it will do that

15222.42 --> 15227.88
but if you're like no yeah torture me

15225.3 --> 15230.099999999999
whatever like I'm just deciding I'm not

15227.88 --> 15233.278999999999
really gonna be phased by it

15230.1 --> 15235.380000000001
well then yeah the hurt will like

15233.279 --> 15237.12
you'll get used to it and then

15235.38 --> 15240.599999999999
eventually like pain doesn't phase you

15237.12 --> 15242.76
anymore so it's really about the mindset

15240.6 --> 15245.58
right and I get everything you said

15242.76 --> 15247.199
applies to emotional pain too people not

15245.58 --> 15249.06
wanting to present themselves in any

15247.199 --> 15251.76
situation where they feel even mildly

15249.06 --> 15254.399
uncomfortable for a moment yeah

15251.76 --> 15256.14
yeah if you do that you're [ __ ]

15254.399 --> 15259.858999999999
right you're literally like

15256.14 --> 15263.34
re-engineering your own social

15259.859 --> 15265.800000000001
like what you do your social system

15263.34 --> 15268.199
you're gonna rearrange it out of fear

15265.8 --> 15270.539999999999
because you fear certain aspects well

15268.199 --> 15272.640000000001
it's never gonna go away than ever

15270.54 --> 15275.76
you'll be stuck to that the rest of your

15272.64 --> 15277.68
life you'll never fix it

15275.76 --> 15280.02
never fix it never make any kind of

15277.68 --> 15282.960000000001
progress in general I've always found

15280.02 --> 15285.300000000001
that I only really make breakthroughs

15282.96 --> 15288.119999999999
once I've forced myself to do something

15285.3 --> 15289.858999999999
that I maybe didn't want to do you know

15288.12 --> 15292.92
that even applies a little bit to the

15289.859 --> 15294.720000000001
the show today just hopping on here I've

15292.92 --> 15296.819
occasionally thought about over the

15294.72 --> 15299.22
years like trying to come out and say

15296.819 --> 15300.72
more and then you get that kind of I get

15299.22 --> 15304.438999999998
that kind of pit in my stomach that's

15300.72 --> 15306.899
like I don't know but uh well maybe you

15304.439 --> 15308.52
needed some more time I mean yeah you

15306.899 --> 15311.819
need sometimes you need time to get

15308.52 --> 15314.58
ready for such a thing like I needed

15311.819 --> 15315.5
time to even like get out on with flat

15314.58 --> 15319.739
Earth

15315.5 --> 15322.739
and like I need to to learn about media

15319.739 --> 15326.58
before so my actual media

15322.739 --> 15329.399
Journey was through Alex Jones like

15326.58 --> 15331.38
early 2000s like that's how I suddenly

15329.399 --> 15333.66
rolled into that and then I started to

15331.38 --> 15335.819
figure out how it worked then Flat Earth

15333.66 --> 15339.06
happened and suddenly I find myself like

15335.819 --> 15341.46
hey I'm actually ready for this but it's

15339.06 --> 15343.56
because it's built up for such a long

15341.46 --> 15345.72
time because I've been exposed to Flat

15343.56 --> 15347.399
Earth when it's very young even and then

15345.72 --> 15349.5
I would just be like oh [ __ ] I can't

15347.399 --> 15351.539999999999
deal with this people go crazy I have

15349.5 --> 15354.0
nobody to share my thoughts about it

15351.54 --> 15356.640000000001
with so just forget about it

15354.0 --> 15359.819
but now all the things were there and I

15356.64 --> 15361.858999999999
was like already ready to start getting

15359.819 --> 15364.08
on social media

15361.859 --> 15367.26
and I basically used the Flat Earth

15364.08 --> 15369.96
Awakening 2015 to decide like okay now

15367.26 --> 15373.319
is my time this is where I do it

15369.96 --> 15377.22
right I've always been very cautious to

15373.319 --> 15379.319
LEAP in anyway like I've people have

15377.22 --> 15381.599999999999
always told me I'm fairly intelligent

15379.319 --> 15384.778999999999
and I guess maybe they know what they're

15381.6 --> 15386.34
talking about but uh yeah like then you

15384.779 --> 15388.199
get stuff like well why don't you go on

15386.34 --> 15391.14
Jeopardy or something and like even now

15388.199 --> 15393.359
I'm like I'm still 10 15 years away from

15391.14 --> 15396.599999999999
being able to know that much useless

15393.359 --> 15398.819
trivia yeah exactly those are just a

15396.6 --> 15402.66
bunch of database people

15398.819 --> 15405.06
right like you could ask them about life

15402.66 --> 15406.92
decisions or like puzzles are like what

15405.06 --> 15410.039999999999
would you do how to solve those people

15406.92 --> 15413.359
don't know [ __ ] right no they just know

15410.04 --> 15413.359
how to memorize crap

15414.439 --> 15420.899
right and yeah it's because like in

15418.02 --> 15423.779
school I I got decent grades never great

15420.899 --> 15425.16
ones but like occasionally some like a

15423.779 --> 15427.02
couple people actually they're like why

15425.16 --> 15431.399
don't you try more and go and get the

15427.02 --> 15432.84
like the 99 98 average and like I never

15431.399 --> 15434.278999999999
saw the point in it because I looked at

15432.84 --> 15437.16
the people that did that and it's

15434.279 --> 15441.779
they're literally just memorizing trivia

15437.16 --> 15443.58
that's it like it's boring boring and

15441.779 --> 15446.52
useless all you learn is a bunch of

15443.58 --> 15449.1
official horse [ __ ] most of the time

15446.52 --> 15452.220000000001
which is definitely by Design to an

15449.1 --> 15455.16
extent to make education seem like it's

15452.22 --> 15458.278999999999
just you know organizing your sector or

15455.16 --> 15460.38
something right but look

15458.279 --> 15461.880000000001
because it is that like a person is like

15460.38 --> 15465.42
a professional

15461.88 --> 15467.88
quiz participant right learning things

15465.42 --> 15469.92
right and they're like doing that for 20

15467.88 --> 15472.198999999999
years and like winning a lot

15469.92 --> 15476.04
right and then you try to explain to

15472.199 --> 15478.439
them uh did you know that like most

15476.04 --> 15480.960000000001
things that you learn in education is a

15478.439 --> 15483.66
lie did you know the Earth is flat did

15480.96 --> 15486.66
you know the medical system is this lie

15483.66 --> 15490.56
those people are like

15486.66 --> 15492.84
yeah but that's everything I am right

15490.56 --> 15495.96
yeah like I don't even understand what I

15492.84 --> 15497.699
know but I know it and I'm so happy that

15495.96 --> 15500.119999999999
at least I know it and now you're

15497.699 --> 15502.800000000001
telling me that everything is wrong

15500.12 --> 15505.62
like those people can never get out of

15502.8 --> 15507.119999999999
that no definitely and it is a

15505.62 --> 15508.859
completely different skill set too

15507.12 --> 15511.5
because like you said and I'm the same

15508.859 --> 15513.42
way with names no good with names but

15511.5 --> 15514.979
those are the kind of people that'll

15513.42 --> 15518.16
remember everybody's name the first time

15514.979 --> 15520.38
you see them exactly that's their power

15518.16 --> 15522.3
right they couldn't give advice for [ __ ]

15520.38 --> 15523.979
to save their lives but they'll know

15522.3 --> 15526.739
everybody's name

15523.979 --> 15528.42
but boy oh boy are they redundant in

15526.739 --> 15530.46
today's civilization because like

15528.42 --> 15532.26
growing up I I kind of at times wish

15530.46 --> 15534.599999999999
that I could remember stuff like that

15532.26 --> 15537.359
better but now that the internet is

15534.6 --> 15538.380000000001
available at your hand at all times you

15537.359 --> 15540.899000000001
literally don't need to remember

15538.38 --> 15542.759999999998
anything no you just need you just need

15540.899 --> 15545.519999999999
an entry key you need a couple of words

15542.76 --> 15548.819
and then you the the computer finds it

15545.52 --> 15550.560000000001
for you right it's like my I had an

15548.819 --> 15553.56
insurance teacher that put it it's not

15550.56 --> 15555.96
about uh it's not about remembering

15553.56 --> 15558.3
stuff it's remembering how to find it is

15555.96 --> 15560.339999999998
is the way he put it and I thought that

15558.3 --> 15561.72
was good exactly yeah that's how I think

15560.34 --> 15564.960000000001
about it too now

15561.72 --> 15567.479
right dude this has been great I got

15564.96 --> 15570.179999999998
around out it's been over four hours and

15567.479 --> 15570.96
15 minutes making this the longest Flat

15570.18 --> 15574.699
Earth

15570.96 --> 15574.698999999999
early bird show of all time

15575.88 --> 15579.778999999999
it's been fantastic though but I mean

15577.92 --> 15581.1
it's getting late I need to eat

15579.779 --> 15582.800000000001
something

15581.1 --> 15585.960000000001
yeah

15582.8 --> 15589.38
right so yeah thank you for being there

15585.96 --> 15591.358999999999
it's been great let's do this again not

15589.38 --> 15594.599999999999
necessarily right away I mean you

15591.359 --> 15597.779
probably need some time to let this sink

15594.6 --> 15600.42
and see what you think about it sure and

15597.779 --> 15605.16
my goal is to be not to evaporate into

15600.42 --> 15607.26
The Ether again so uh I'll be trying to

15605.16 --> 15611.22
hang around more often and I definitely

15607.26 --> 15613.62
need to get my videos out I'm uh

15611.22 --> 15615.899
like I shared a little bit of scripts

15613.62 --> 15618.18
with with Arwen but I do definitely want

15615.899 --> 15619.08
to do one that's more topical and I'm

15618.18 --> 15620.58
about

15619.08 --> 15623.1
I don't know two-thirds of the way

15620.58 --> 15625.319
through writing that one so once I eat

15623.1 --> 15626.939
that written I should be able to turn it

15625.319 --> 15629.278999999999
out pretty quick

15626.939 --> 15631.199
yeah looking forward to it man I mean

15629.279 --> 15634.319000000001
yeah

15631.199 --> 15636.66
the idea is that you shared were like

15634.319 --> 15639.3
they fit perfectly so it's like yeah

15636.66 --> 15642.479
it's like it never stopped

15639.3 --> 15645.119999999999
so yeah I can't I can't wait for you to

15642.479 --> 15647.64
finish that and and present that I'll

15645.12 --> 15649.199
definitely share that with everybody

15647.64 --> 15651.72
right

15649.199 --> 15654.42
but yeah sure we'll try to maybe come up

15651.72 --> 15656.16
with a thing where I can pop on every

15654.42 --> 15659.1
few weeks or a month something like that

15656.16 --> 15661.619999999999
yeah whenever you just feel like it yeah

15659.1 --> 15663.899000000001
or whenever I also feel it's not yeah

15661.62 --> 15666.239000000001
you know what I mean when it's time

15663.899 --> 15668.399
we'll do it again especially using you

15666.239 --> 15670.92
to kind of hold myself accountable here

15668.399 --> 15673.68
too because I I do want to be more

15670.92 --> 15676.02
involved and when you're kind of off to

15673.68 --> 15677.76
the side it's easy to let it disappear

15676.02 --> 15679.560000000001
and then all of it like it's shocking to

15677.76 --> 15682.68
me that my last video was over two years

15679.56 --> 15684.778999999999
ago now like that's incredible but

15682.68 --> 15686.279
well it's a good sign it means that

15684.779 --> 15688.979000000001
apparently

15686.279 --> 15690.18
you had fun because if it flies by that

15688.979 --> 15693.96
quick

15690.18 --> 15695.720000000001
right well fun and we we moved and

15693.96 --> 15698.519999999999

15695.72 --> 15700.8

15698.52 --> 15703.5
time instead of instead of renting oh so

15700.8 --> 15706.5

15703.5 --> 15708.899
