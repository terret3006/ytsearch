button that would be much appreciated

91.36 --> 95.84
man

93.36 --> 97.6
literally thought for a second like to

95.84 --> 99.119
leave it out and then i said it anyway

97.6 --> 102.479
it's that

99.119 --> 102.479
it's dead automated

102.56 --> 106.56
i'm gonna keep saying it for like

104.0 --> 107.68
another half year aren't i

106.56 --> 110.88
uh

107.68 --> 114.36000000000001
anyway the weather today is again

110.88 --> 114.36
quite gorgeous

115.36 --> 119.2
this time there's like

117.68 --> 123.43900000000001
no wind

119.2 --> 123.43900000000001
so it's actually really warm outside

126.479 --> 130.959
uh yeah there is

129.2 --> 134.07999999999998
a little bit of haze up there though

130.959 --> 136.879
that the planes do seem to

134.08 --> 138.959
leave something behind

136.879 --> 142.67999999999998
which will probably turn into a bit of a

138.959 --> 142.68
gray soup but

143.92 --> 149.0
yeah it's a beautiful day super sunny

163.28 --> 167.28
wow my camera didn't freeze

167.599 --> 170.599
huh

172.319 --> 176.0
hello kevlar first in chat ralph

174.64 --> 178.0
rodriguez

176.0 --> 180.239
good to see you

178.0 --> 184.08
it is tuesday

180.239 --> 187.12
the 22nd of march 2022

184.08 --> 187.12
that's a lot of twos

197.12 --> 200.239
so how are you doing

204.08 --> 207.20000000000002
i'm

205.28 --> 210.0
personally doing okay

207.2 --> 211.04
my jaw seems to have just completely 100

210.0 --> 213.84
healed up

211.04 --> 213.84
like

214.56 --> 220.799
i don't even notice it

217.12 --> 220.799
ah at the same time

224.64 --> 228.55999999999997
feeling a little frustrated out there

228.959 --> 232.84
it's just for springtime

243.28 --> 247.92
right and springtime with me tends to

245.92 --> 250.64
make me

247.92 --> 251.599
get kind of punishing towards myself i

250.64 --> 255.83999999999997
don't know

251.599 --> 259.12
it's just i don't know

255.84 --> 262.8
i guess it you could say that's like the

259.12 --> 263.919
it's the engine buffing up effect like

262.8 --> 266.32
so

263.919 --> 269.84
my response is i get very harsh on

266.32 --> 269.84
myself mentally

271.04 --> 276.47900000000004
which i guess is kind of a

273.84 --> 279.44
intuitive attempt to make myself more

276.479 --> 279.44
worthy or something

280.56 --> 287.28000000000003
but yeah since i'm kind of a hermit it

283.6 --> 287.28000000000003
doesn't really work out that well

289.5 --> 292.589
[Music]

292.88 --> 298.08
and yeah

295.44 --> 299.68
there's a lot of suggestions out there

298.08 --> 303.919
too

299.68 --> 306.88
like owen benjamin is a stream yesterday

303.919 --> 306.88
and yeah that

307.44 --> 310.71999999999997
it was a good stream

309.12 --> 314.0
from what i've seen so far i haven't

310.72 --> 318.0
really watched a lot of it yet

314.0 --> 320.4
the fox day was on it

318.0 --> 322.479
two days ago as well

320.4 --> 324.94
just telling you just get a family oh

322.479 --> 326.08
just do it or just do this just dead and

324.94 --> 328.24
[Music]

326.08 --> 331.35999999999996
i find that

328.24 --> 331.36
very frustrating

332.16 --> 337.6
yeah it's not the first time i've heard

334.0 --> 339.68
any of that been hearing that for like

337.6 --> 343.36
25 years

339.68 --> 343.36
and it's always frustrated me

347.12 --> 353.28000000000003
but

348.4 --> 356.23999999999995
what platform is owen benjamin come on

353.28 --> 356.23999999999995
how many times

356.56 --> 361.199
bit shoot

358.16 --> 366.28000000000003
owen benjamin [ __ ] you do i need to put

361.199 --> 366.28000000000003
it in the freaking description box man

374.88 --> 379.56
sorry if i'm a bit snappy i'm just

382.24 --> 387.12
i feel like yelling

384.72 --> 387.12
a lot

388.8 --> 392.16
right i got

390.56 --> 394.72
some gusto

392.16 --> 396.72
i did kind of like that yesterday

394.72 --> 399.84000000000003
oh by the way the freaking weird

396.72 --> 402.0
dizziness is finally gone completely

399.84 --> 404.31899999999996
very happy about that was getting on my

402.0 --> 404.319
nerves

406.72 --> 409.72
ah

423.36 --> 426.72
what's good though that's

428.08 --> 432.479
i think it's like

430.4 --> 434.08
spanish for

432.479 --> 437.4
let's go

434.08 --> 437.4
or like

438.479 --> 440.96
it's like

441.36 --> 443.84000000000003
yeah

442.319 --> 445.84000000000003
it's gusto

443.84 --> 449.71999999999997
it's an expression

445.84 --> 449.71999999999997
in spanish i think

451.759 --> 454.96000000000004
i think it's like uh

455.28 --> 460.71999999999997
gusto is sort of like the impulsive

457.68 --> 460.72
feeling of let's

462.84 --> 469.11999999999995
go enthusiasm it is associated with

466.08 --> 473.71999999999997
enthusiasm thank you seeking star wars

469.12 --> 473.72
hello by the way and adam price

479.68 --> 485.40000000000003
cristo means treat

482.4 --> 485.4
really

493.759 --> 497.12
now i'm gonna google it

497.56 --> 502.72
[Applause]

500.319 --> 504.96000000000004
enjoyment and enthusiasm in doing

502.72 --> 509.759
something

504.96 --> 509.75899999999996
it doesn't say from what language though

512.64 --> 517.36
according to this it's just english

515.039 --> 517.36
weird

518.719 --> 526.08
in spanish it means taste

522.56 --> 528.7199999999999
okay i think i got it all wrong well

526.08 --> 528.72
that's new

528.8 --> 531.8
right

535.279 --> 539.68
anyway i kind of like it

537.04 --> 542.64
this is like a sort of energy drink

539.68 --> 544.7199999999999
that's not gross filled with sugar and

542.64 --> 548.08
like too much caffeine

544.72 --> 550.0
and there's a lot of

548.08 --> 552.8000000000001
jin sang in there like

550.0 --> 555.8
every conceivable form of ginseng is in

552.8 --> 555.8
this

567.76 --> 571.48
hello adam price

585.76 --> 591.279
but yeah i've been thinking back to when

588.16 --> 593.12
i was younger in my teens

591.279 --> 596.32
is that i realized that

593.12 --> 597.12
my ego gets in my way a lot

596.32 --> 599.36
like

597.12 --> 600.16
to the point

599.36 --> 604.519
where

600.16 --> 604.519
i really start to hate it

605.04 --> 609.04
and it typically does happen like

609.36 --> 615.6800000000001
i guess associated with sexuality

612.56 --> 617.76
with relationships and have always been

615.68 --> 619.5999999999999
like

617.76 --> 621.68
stubborn

619.6 --> 623.44
so even when i was younger i had the

621.68 --> 626.0
idea like could

623.44 --> 627.44
i hope my parents can arrange and marry

626.0 --> 629.12
marriage yeah

627.44 --> 631.2790000000001
guess what that doesn't really happen

629.12 --> 632.88
here in the netherlands especially with

631.279 --> 634.24
liberals

632.88 --> 636.079
right

634.24 --> 639.92
so

636.079 --> 642.4799999999999
i was just kind of disappointed

639.92 --> 645.36
because i think that could

642.48 --> 648.0
work out for me really well because for

645.36 --> 650.88
me a relationship pretty much is like a

648.0 --> 654.079
marriage a contract it's like oh we're

650.88 --> 654.079
partners now right

655.839 --> 661.36
like who the [ __ ] gives about love right

658.88 --> 663.279
being in love is like the most useless

661.36 --> 666.519
sensation ever

663.279 --> 666.519
to me

679.6 --> 684.16
okay

681.2 --> 686.0
i did have a song actually

684.16 --> 688.079
right but i've been thinking about that

686.0 --> 690.56
and then i'm just like jesus what the

688.079 --> 694.2399999999999
[ __ ] would i be like as a dad if i had

690.56 --> 694.2399999999999
like sons or a son

695.279 --> 701.8389999999999
could i do with that son what i in

699.36 --> 705.279
retrospect desperately want it for

701.839 --> 706.6400000000001
myself could i get like really

705.279 --> 708.72
really like

706.64 --> 710.72
get him like close he's like you're

708.72 --> 713.36
gonna [ __ ] do this

710.72 --> 715.839
like i am like if you don't [ __ ] do

713.36 --> 718.639
this i will take your stuff from your

715.839 --> 721.2790000000001
room tie you up and then burn it all one

718.639 --> 724.88
by one until you agree

721.279 --> 726.959
you are going to do these things

724.88 --> 730.639
then i realized that that's probably not

726.959 --> 733.1199999999999
gonna make me a very popular person

730.639 --> 736.0790000000001
like towards that son

733.12 --> 738.32
or others except maybe with my son

736.079 --> 739.279
afterward he'd realize like yeah thanks

738.32 --> 742.72
dad

739.279 --> 744.32
like i realized afterward that oh [ __ ] i

742.72 --> 747.0400000000001
wish babe my parents would have done

744.32 --> 749.6
that but no i had to freaking outsmart

747.04 --> 752.48
them i i had to freaking play on their

749.6 --> 757.8000000000001
emotions like a [ __ ] liberal

752.48 --> 757.8000000000001
i hate it i hate what's in me

760.079 --> 765.279
my kids would hate me yeah well maybe

762.16 --> 768.279
that's for the better like who the [ __ ]

765.279 --> 768.279
cares

772.72 --> 777.6
like if i know something would be

775.44 --> 781.839
absolutely better on the long run for

777.6 --> 781.839
them yet they refuse because

782.56 --> 788.0
yeah maybe i should do things that would

785.2 --> 790.0790000000001
absolutely make them hate me and make

788.0 --> 790.959
them feel like i robbed them of their

790.079 --> 793.4399999999999
youth

790.959 --> 796.3199999999999
in trade of them actually getting a

793.44 --> 796.32
[ __ ] life

797.04 --> 800.959
yeah

798.399 --> 803.279
and that's fine they can freaking

800.959 --> 806.959
kill me whatever but they at least

803.279 --> 806.959
they'll have a [ __ ] life

811.279 --> 815.279
because my parents

813.68 --> 818.6389999999999
they did not

815.279 --> 820.959
force me to get jobs

818.639 --> 822.32
like they gave up at some point

820.959 --> 828.16
that

822.32 --> 831.279
murdered me okay it murdered me

828.16 --> 833.8389999999999
i wish they had literally done that tied

831.279 --> 837.36
me up and said like we're going to burn

833.839 --> 842.7600000000001
your stuff if you don't [ __ ] do this

837.36 --> 842.76
from now on till the day you [ __ ] die

852.399 --> 859.199
and i would explain it to them too

856.079 --> 861.8389999999999
you know what happens if you [ __ ] let

859.199 --> 863.68
your kids just do whatever the [ __ ] they

861.839 --> 866.0
want

863.68 --> 866.0
yeah

866.24 --> 871.6
they'll end up caring more about getting

868.56 --> 875.1199999999999
money for freaking drugs and [ __ ]

871.6 --> 878.0790000000001
than to actually build up an income yeah

875.12 --> 880.32
they will literally care more about that

878.079 --> 883.199
and there's nothing that you can change

880.32 --> 885.1990000000001
that right at that point once it's come

883.199 --> 886.7199999999999
that far there's nothing you could do

885.199 --> 888.56
about it

886.72 --> 893.36
the only point you could do something

888.56 --> 893.3599999999999
about it is before that happened

893.44 --> 897.639
i'm sorry guys i'm

905.279 --> 908.32
if you know what i mean

909.279 --> 912.279
[ __ ]

915.68 --> 920.8
yeah i feel like my kids wouldn't take

917.68 --> 925.4799999999999
me seriously yeah well who gives a [ __ ]

920.8 --> 925.4799999999999
i will take the power

937.04 --> 945.199
i mean [ __ ] liberalism guys [ __ ] it

941.519 --> 948.079
i mean as a very little kid as a preteen

945.199 --> 948.079
that's awesome

948.32 --> 951.6
after that

949.68 --> 953.04
it's a giant

951.6 --> 957.6800000000001
giant

953.04 --> 957.68
life robbing disaster

965.92 --> 971.5999999999999
hello david barry you got a weird

969.12 --> 972.399
peaks and valleys too today yeah me too

971.6 --> 976.32

976.32 --> 980.9590000000001
to myself

978.079 --> 980.959
about this [ __ ]

981.12 --> 985.04
no there's not a lot of sugar in there i

983.12 --> 988.0
don't think there's any sugar in here

985.04 --> 988.0
there might be a little

989.519 --> 992.24
let's see

994.399 --> 999.12
oh there's

995.519 --> 999.12
some caramel in there

999.759 --> 1002.48
no sugar

1003.279 --> 1010.16
like apple juice concentrate caramel

1007.759 --> 1011.6
lemon juice concentrate botanical

1010.16 --> 1014.639
extracts nope

1011.6 --> 1014.639
no sugar added

1015.759 --> 1020.639
right and just taking a couple of sips

1018.24 --> 1021.519
doesn't turn me into a raving maniac

1020.639 --> 1025.6
after

1021.519 --> 1028.0
like two minutes so that's not it

1025.6 --> 1030.24
was feeling like this before i opened

1028.0 --> 1032.24
that bottle

1030.24 --> 1034.0
uh

1032.24 --> 1036.16

1043.679 --> 1047.199
faculties it's just that

1050.0 --> 1053.44
you know sometimes regaining your

1051.679 --> 1056.4
faculties

1053.44 --> 1058.96
then kind of takes away that that very

1056.4 --> 1061.44
convenient excuse of oh i'm not a

1058.96 --> 1063.919
hundred percent that means i can't

1061.44 --> 1066.0
really do about anything about these

1063.919 --> 1068.5590000000002
things so i'm just gonna shove them to

1066.0 --> 1071.039
the side oh i'm back to normal guess

1068.559 --> 1073.44
what here comes the pile of [ __ ] rolling

1071.039 --> 1075.12
back now look at everything you haven't

1073.44 --> 1077.8400000000001
done are we

1075.12 --> 1080.84
look at that

1077.84 --> 1080.84
yay

1095.84 --> 1100.08
don't apologize for being given time to

1099.12 --> 1103.84
learn

1100.08 --> 1105.9189999999999
yeah but what the [ __ ] is the point

1103.84 --> 1107.6
to learn something

1105.919 --> 1111.1200000000001
when you learn it

1107.6 --> 1111.12
when it's too late

1111.2 --> 1116.72
what is the [ __ ] point

1113.6 --> 1120.48
right the only thing i get out of it is

1116.72 --> 1122.48
the potential to give my if i ever get

1120.48 --> 1125.919
lucky enough to get kids

1122.48 --> 1127.919
to give them a chance to not make the

1125.919 --> 1131.5200000000002
same mistake

1127.919 --> 1134.5590000000002
that's the only thing i can get out of

1131.52 --> 1134.559
learning this

1134.84 --> 1140.9599999999998
yeah to because my parents up to a

1138.32 --> 1143.28
certain degree tried to emphasize

1140.96 --> 1145.679
right like oh but you really got to work

1143.28 --> 1149.28
you go you go to work this and that and

1145.679 --> 1152.0800000000002
i i ne they never refined it

1149.28 --> 1153.9189999999999
they never refined that information to

1152.08 --> 1156.48
me they just said it they were

1153.919 --> 1159.2800000000002
frustrated as they were saying it they

1156.48 --> 1161.52
realized they hated work too my dad

1159.28 --> 1165.32
has always hated work he's working now

1161.52 --> 1165.32
more than ever

1165.52 --> 1171.44
he's catching up right because he was

1168.24 --> 1173.84
like me too when he was younger and they

1171.44 --> 1175.52
both were liberal and they kept liberal

1173.84 --> 1176.8799999999999
they were like oh

1175.52 --> 1178.799
you're going to work you go to work but

1176.88 --> 1179.7600000000002
they didn't really mean it so it's like

1178.799 --> 1181.2
oh

1179.76 --> 1183.12
so you're just saying that are you

1181.2 --> 1185.6000000000001
trying to enslave me because you don't

1183.12 --> 1186.9599999999998
seem to mean it i'm not gonna do that

1185.6 --> 1189.9189999999999
i'm gonna

1186.96 --> 1192.64
imagine like i'm growing up in a society

1189.919 --> 1195.1200000000001
where you no longer have to work yeah

1192.64 --> 1198.0800000000002
liberal oh it's the future i can just

1195.12 --> 1200.08
i can just be a [ __ ] little boomer

1198.08 --> 1202.0
in these times that's what i thought

1200.08 --> 1204.799
when i was a kid and i'm freaking

1202.0 --> 1207.52
embarrassed to death about it okay i'm

1204.799 --> 1210.96
so embarrassed

1207.52 --> 1213.76
yeah when i say i [ __ ] hate myself

1210.96 --> 1215.919
from those times ago that that's not a

1213.76 --> 1216.72
superficial [ __ ] thing

1215.919 --> 1221.3600000000001
yeah

1216.72 --> 1223.44
what i was has freaking ruined my life

1221.36 --> 1226.7199999999998
in so many ways

1223.44 --> 1231.52
and i can't really restore it

1226.72 --> 1234.24
my ways have been set because of it

1231.52 --> 1239.039
if i want anything about that back it's

1234.24 --> 1241.84
going to cost me 10 fold

1239.039 --> 1241.84
you understand

1242.0 --> 1247.36
yeah getting married getting kids

1244.799 --> 1249.6
after your 20s

1247.36 --> 1252.7199999999998
that's problematic

1249.6 --> 1252.7199999999998
it always is

1253.36 --> 1260.1589999999999
yeah i don't have like the the forte

1257.28 --> 1262.32
like the insatiable

1260.159 --> 1266.0800000000002
energy

1262.32 --> 1266.08
to basically build up

1266.799 --> 1271.039
i spent it all on freaking intellect

1269.44 --> 1273.6000000000001
things yeah

1271.039 --> 1275.919
not even reading books not even writing

1273.6 --> 1277.6789999999999
books just thinking building my mind

1275.919 --> 1280.24
frame now i got a freaking mind frame

1277.679 --> 1282.0800000000002
yay i got a mind frame oh i'm so smart

1280.24 --> 1287.24
i'm so special

1282.08 --> 1287.24
i [ __ ] my life though for it

1314.08 --> 1317.6
yes

1315.12 --> 1319.6789999999999
refracted curvature well you should know

1317.6 --> 1322.1589999999999
you're like buried under children all

1319.679 --> 1322.159
the time

1323.6 --> 1326.9599999999998
i mean if you'd have any more children

1325.44 --> 1329.039
we wouldn't be able to make out what

1326.96 --> 1330.559
you're even saying during your life

1329.039 --> 1333.6
during the live streams because they

1330.559 --> 1336.24
would be literally on your face making

1333.6 --> 1340.6789999999999
you unable to speak in the mic

1336.24 --> 1340.679
as they crawl all over you

1356.08 --> 1360.799
right but yeah if i'd be with a woman i

1359.84 --> 1362.9599999999998
and

1360.799 --> 1365.76
she would be crazy enough to actually

1362.96 --> 1365.76
get kids with me

1366.559 --> 1369.6
i shouldn't say that

1370.64 --> 1374.5590000000002
yeah then she

1372.559 --> 1376.48
she better well have a good instinct to

1374.559 --> 1378.3999999999999
hold me back

1376.48 --> 1380.48
from being super strict when they're

1378.4 --> 1382.72
young and then she's gonna have to be

1380.48 --> 1385.2
like kind of nervous when they get older

1382.72 --> 1387.52
like above 12 and then like they

1385.2 --> 1390.24
our win is unleashed

1387.52 --> 1393.36
because i'm gonna freaking train them

1390.24 --> 1397.159
like actually train them

1393.36 --> 1397.1589999999999
no [ __ ] around

1410.4 --> 1414.0
hey classical homeopath you [ __ ] up

1412.48 --> 1415.44
your life too

1414.0 --> 1417.84
this bad

1415.44 --> 1417.8400000000001
really

1421.84 --> 1425.6789999999999
children are awesome then they grow up

1426.0 --> 1432.96
i don't see how that's a problem

1429.6 --> 1435.36
yeah the problem with children sometimes

1432.96 --> 1437.679
is that they grow

1435.36 --> 1440.08
but they don't grow up that's the

1437.679 --> 1442.0800000000002
problem if they actually grow up that's

1440.08 --> 1444.6399999999999
awesome because then

1442.08 --> 1446.3999999999999
they also take responsibility

1444.64 --> 1448.64
and they're gonna actually respect you

1446.4 --> 1451.679
as a as an elder

1448.64 --> 1453.8400000000001
yeah like i try to respect my dad

1451.679 --> 1456.5590000000002
while constantly being aware that

1453.84 --> 1458.799
technically i am massively disappointing

1456.559 --> 1461.279
him and that he's been aware that that

1458.799 --> 1464.08
was inevitable for quite a long time so

1461.279 --> 1466.08
he's hardened himself to just have a

1464.08 --> 1467.6
doable relation with one another where

1466.08 --> 1470.3999999999999
we can still just

1467.6 --> 1470.3999999999999
like each other

1470.84 --> 1477.6
okay growing up is not the problem

1474.559 --> 1479.6789999999999
not growing up is the problem

1477.6 --> 1481.36
that's the real problem

1479.679 --> 1484.159
is when you fail

1481.36 --> 1484.1589999999999
as a parent

1484.48 --> 1489.44
and they don't grow up

1486.72 --> 1492.72
and they refuse to bite that bullet they

1489.44 --> 1496.0
refuse to take that painful [ __ ] step

1492.72 --> 1499.039
to adulthood that's the problem

1496.0 --> 1503.799
not that they grow up if they just grow

1499.039 --> 1503.799
up then there wouldn't be a problem

1518.32 --> 1520.8799999999999
theo mean

1523.84 --> 1527.84
okay

1525.2 --> 1530.159
heard of that theo mean what is that

1527.84 --> 1530.1589999999999
again

1536.0 --> 1539.269
[Applause]

1541.52 --> 1544.4
it's a b1

1545.84 --> 1550.36
okay

1547.12 --> 1550.36
it's interesting

1568.159 --> 1574.72
and some child the world corrupts their

1570.08 --> 1574.72
mind well only if you let it

1576.4 --> 1578.72
right

1579.52 --> 1586.799
the world tries to corrupt their minds

1582.88 --> 1589.1200000000001
if you properly prepare your kid

1586.799 --> 1592.08
then it doesn't have to

1589.12 --> 1594.32
it will just be an annoying seduction to

1592.08 --> 1594.32
them

1594.4 --> 1597.919
right

1595.44 --> 1599.6000000000001
if you actually raise your kids i guess

1597.919 --> 1600.72
it works maybe more for boys or

1599.6 --> 1603.9189999999999
something

1600.72 --> 1605.279
militantly to realize like yeah i am

1603.919 --> 1608.5590000000002
sorry son

1605.279 --> 1611.52
but this is literally hell

1608.559 --> 1613.84
and if you don't freaking pay attention

1611.52 --> 1617.12
to the highest degree you will be

1613.84 --> 1619.76
seduced to literally

1617.12 --> 1622.8799999999999
attract suffering to you that's gonna

1619.76 --> 1624.8799999999999
nag you the rest of your [ __ ] life

1622.88 --> 1627.679
so you better damn well take the

1624.88 --> 1629.7600000000002
seduction serious and like

1627.679 --> 1632.3200000000002
do everything in your power not to give

1629.76 --> 1633.84
into that and don't obsess over it

1632.32 --> 1636.799
either

1633.84 --> 1640.799
just do the right thing in the moment

1636.799 --> 1641.84
and then absolutely drop it never dwell

1640.799 --> 1644.8799999999999
on it

1641.84 --> 1647.76
just do the right thing and lay it down

1644.88 --> 1647.7600000000002
immediately

1649.84 --> 1654.6789999999999
i'm being very dramatic today

1669.279 --> 1675.76
eat loads of meat not enough to complete

1671.52 --> 1679.9189999999999
well i take b12 supplements so if that

1675.76 --> 1682.559
is anywhere close to that the amine

1679.919 --> 1684.5590000000002
then i should be good and b12 does good

1682.559 --> 1685.44
for me like even my healer confirmed

1684.559 --> 1688.6399999999999
that

1685.44 --> 1691.8400000000001
just funny because he usually is not

1688.64 --> 1694.88
like oh take supplements no but

1691.84 --> 1697.36
he will point out like this is good this

1694.88 --> 1700.159
is not good he's the one that told me

1697.36 --> 1703.1999999999998
like hey maybe you should stop the d3

1700.159 --> 1705.2
i have not been on d3 now

1703.2 --> 1707.279
for weeks

1705.2 --> 1708.24
i haven't actually started taking it

1707.279 --> 1710.88
again

1708.24 --> 1712.159
and i'm i'm great

1710.88 --> 1712.96
i'm okay

1712.159 --> 1715.8400000000001
yeah

1712.96 --> 1719.44
shocker shocker oh you need to know you

1715.84 --> 1720.9599999999998
need it so bad no no i don't i don't

1719.44 --> 1723.76
need it

1720.96 --> 1725.44
yeah and these moods

1723.76 --> 1726.48
i've had them

1725.44 --> 1729.44
well

1726.48 --> 1732.48
pretty much publicly for years and in

1729.44 --> 1736.64
all those years i have been taking d3

1732.48 --> 1736.64
yeah so that does not relate

1736.88 --> 1743.679
i don't need it

1738.88 --> 1743.679
i don't actually need vitamin d3

1744.64 --> 1750.0800000000002
i do consider it now to be like an

1748.279 --> 1752.64
antidepressant

1750.08 --> 1755.1999999999998
which is absolutely something i would

1752.64 --> 1757.2
never take right pharmaceutical

1755.2 --> 1758.159
antidepressant but those people that

1757.2 --> 1760.48
have

1758.159 --> 1763.0390000000002
they take it in phases and then they

1760.48 --> 1764.0
have to get off it because if they stay

1763.039 --> 1767.679
on it

1764.0 --> 1769.76
things go really freaky and bad

1767.679 --> 1772.3200000000002
you have to get off it again

1769.76 --> 1774.8799999999999
if you become life dependent your entire

1772.32 --> 1778.0
inner chemistry becomes [ __ ]

1774.88 --> 1780.24
right and i am treating d3

1778.0 --> 1782.24
like antidepressant now i think it's

1780.24 --> 1784.72
very valuable to have

1782.24 --> 1785.679
in case like things could really go to

1784.72 --> 1787.919
[ __ ]

1785.679 --> 1791.2
unexpectedly

1787.919 --> 1791.2
and you need a little blanket

1791.6 --> 1798.0
but i'm not taking it constantly

1795.12 --> 1801.12
like some people

1798.0 --> 1801.12
freaking recommend

1801.919 --> 1805.919
like because ever since i basically

1804.0 --> 1808.64
followed that advice and announced that

1805.919 --> 1810.96
publicly like

1808.64 --> 1813.44
on alex jones they've been like

1810.96 --> 1815.3600000000001
like super hammered you have to take it

1813.44 --> 1817.3600000000001
you have to take the d3 oh my god

1815.36 --> 1819.6
especially if you're black girl you have

1817.36 --> 1821.6789999999999
to take it oh no

1819.6 --> 1824.48
like [ __ ] you dude

1821.679 --> 1828.64
like that freaking ad he made the

1824.48 --> 1831.6
freaking day i basically talked about it

1828.64 --> 1833.76
on my show it's been like

1831.6 --> 1838.08
yelling at me ever since i turned on the

1833.76 --> 1839.6
alex jones show really annoying

1838.08 --> 1841.279
and wrong

1839.6 --> 1844.24
it's wrong

1841.279 --> 1844.24
it doesn't work

1846.399 --> 1850.9599999999998
it's great if you're freaking depressed

1848.799 --> 1853.679
if you have chronic depression issues

1850.96 --> 1855.76
try vitamin d3 yeah

1853.679 --> 1859.0800000000002
stay off the pharmaceuticals and try

1855.76 --> 1859.08
that [ __ ]

1868.96 --> 1873.279
whenever you start taking vitamin c you

1871.44 --> 1874.48
catch a cold

1873.279 --> 1876.24
okay

1874.48 --> 1878.64
well

1876.24 --> 1879.519
depends on what type of vitamin c you

1878.64 --> 1882.159
take

1879.519 --> 1884.72
but that could simply mean is that

1882.159 --> 1886.96
your body

1884.72 --> 1886.96
yeah

1887.12 --> 1892.559
getting a cold is effectively the final

1890.64 --> 1894.5590000000002
stage it means

1892.559 --> 1897.6789999999999
if you get a cold that's when the

1894.559 --> 1900.32
cleanup process starts right that's an

1897.679 --> 1902.64
afterward process so if you take vitamin

1900.32 --> 1905.279
c and then you get a cold that means

1902.64 --> 1906.48
that it very effectively and quickly

1905.279 --> 1910.399
fixes

1906.48 --> 1910.3990000000001
some issues that might be chronic

1910.72 --> 1915.84
or like very easy

1912.96 --> 1917.919
low threshold for you

1915.84 --> 1921.4399999999998
so you then get a call right it's just

1917.919 --> 1924.7990000000002
like my mother got a cold every time she

1921.44 --> 1927.679
had a vacation every single time for

1924.799 --> 1930.32
like 25 years every

1927.679 --> 1931.279
single time does that mean

1930.32 --> 1933.279
that

1931.279 --> 1936.159
having a vacation

1933.279 --> 1938.159
give you a cold

1936.159 --> 1940.3990000000001
no

1938.159 --> 1942.64
and that's very obvious that that's not

1940.399 --> 1945.12
a direct

1942.64 --> 1947.519
cause a causal relation right

1945.12 --> 1950.399
so if you take vitamin c you get a cold

1947.519 --> 1952.88
that's not caused by the vitamin c it's

1950.399 --> 1955.9189999999999
rather resolved

1952.88 --> 1957.2
whatever the backdrop issue is which the

1955.919 --> 1958.5590000000002
cold are the

1957.2 --> 1963.2
symptoms of

1958.559 --> 1966.24
afterward that is what it resolves

1963.2 --> 1966.24
that's how i see that

1968.559 --> 1973.399
getting cause a regenerative process

1970.399 --> 1973.399
exactly

1976.24 --> 1981.36
and i'm freaking snotty every morning

1978.88 --> 1984.88
doesn't matter if it's summer or winter

1981.36 --> 1984.8799999999999
it's actually worse in the summer

1989.6 --> 1995.279
and i've been for

1992.0 --> 1999.08
pretty much half my life

1995.279 --> 1999.08
and even in my youth

2013.12 --> 2019.84
is there a particular commercial product

2016.159 --> 2019.8400000000001
what what are you talking about

2038.799 --> 2042.8799999999999
right also i realized that

2043.039 --> 2047.039
something i have tried before

2045.679 --> 2050.56
if i ever want to get a freaking

2047.039 --> 2052.32
girlfriend i'm gonna have to like make a

2050.56 --> 2053.44
list in my mind

2052.32 --> 2056.639
like yeah

2053.44 --> 2057.679
you are going to be rejected by 20 women

2056.639 --> 2061.359
at least

2057.679 --> 2064.8
before you're allowed to stop trying

2061.359 --> 2064.7999999999997
it once you start trying

2066.159 --> 2069.9190000000003
and i'm like going to have to hold to

2068.639 --> 2072.7200000000003
that

2069.919 --> 2074.72
like yeah that's normal it's like being

2072.72 --> 2077.5989999999997
rejected by a woman

2074.72 --> 2079.6789999999996
is just like trying to get a job oh

2077.599 --> 2081.76
that's just great isn't it because

2079.679 --> 2085.679
when i get rejected from trying to get a

2081.76 --> 2086.7200000000003
job i get freaking nightmares

2085.679 --> 2091.839
ah

2086.72 --> 2091.839
so lovely being irwin it's so lovely

2093.679 --> 2097.92
but yeah

2096.079 --> 2100.0
like i'm going to have to have in mind

2097.92 --> 2102.8
i'm probably going to be dream staring

2100.0 --> 2104.64
towards certain women a couple of women

2102.8 --> 2106.32
and be like yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm

2104.64 --> 2108.72
going to get her

2106.32 --> 2111.04
and then i have to realize i'm probably

2108.72 --> 2113.359
going to be rejected by every single one

2111.04 --> 2113.359
of them

2113.68 --> 2118.96
probably

2115.599 --> 2122.2400000000002
and then somebody unexpected that in

2118.96 --> 2124.7200000000003
that very moment i'm like

2122.24 --> 2127.2799999999997
i don't even want them that much they'll

2124.72 --> 2128.64
be my [ __ ] wife the rest of my life

2127.28 --> 2131.119
yeah

2128.64 --> 2134.48
i know it's gonna [ __ ] work like that

2131.119 --> 2137.04
it always does this sort of [ __ ] always

2134.48 --> 2140.079
works like that with me

2137.04 --> 2142.4
i'm not the only one

2140.079 --> 2146.5600000000004
just gonna have to get used to it

2142.4 --> 2146.56
opposites attract i don't i hope not

2153.28 --> 2158.5600000000004
well yeah i guess

2155.44 --> 2160.88
the hope has nothing to do with it

2158.56 --> 2162.72
but i don't even i don't even want to be

2160.88 --> 2164.88
attracted i just want to have a good

2162.72 --> 2169.2
wife i just

2164.88 --> 2170.88
want a super loyal partner that is like

2169.2 --> 2174.16
willing to be

2170.88 --> 2176.7200000000003
my caretaker as i am willing to be their

2174.16 --> 2179.44
character care and we will be the

2176.72 --> 2182.0789999999997
caretakers of our children

2179.44 --> 2183.92
that's what i want reliable i don't i

2182.079 --> 2186.2400000000002
don't give a [ __ ]

2183.92 --> 2188.8
about love anymore i am so done with

2186.24 --> 2188.7999999999997

2194.16 --> 2196.48
years

and i'll do that

2200.56 --> 2204.88
[ __ ] love

2202.16 --> 2204.8799999999997
i hate it

2209.839 --> 2215.7599999999998
that's okay ralph rodriguez hey if it

2212.24 --> 2216.64
worked for you then why not share it

2215.76 --> 2218.8
right

2216.64 --> 2220.96
so good

2218.8 --> 2224.5600000000004
i'm just whining about

2220.96 --> 2227.44
my freaking spring frustrations anyway

2224.56 --> 2229.839
not like anybody cares

2227.44 --> 2229.839
hold on

2254.56 --> 2260.64
i need to redefine what

2257.119 --> 2260.6400000000003
attractive is to me

2262.56 --> 2267.92
i don't even know anymore man i haven't

2264.96 --> 2267.92
for a long time

2268.0 --> 2273.44
i mean if you literally look

2270.4 --> 2275.2000000000003
at every single ex-girlfriend i have

2273.44 --> 2278.2400000000002
they are all

2275.2 --> 2280.2799999999997
totally different looking

2278.24 --> 2284.16
like

2280.28 --> 2287.44
absolutely not similar in any way i mean

2284.16 --> 2288.72
seriously like i've had faces of all

2287.44 --> 2292.7200000000003
designs

2288.72 --> 2295.04
and every single time it was in love

2292.72 --> 2297.04
i never fall in love with the same type

2295.04 --> 2300.16
of girl twice in a row

2297.04 --> 2302.4
or ever really

2300.16 --> 2305.1189999999997
so i don't understand how that works

2302.4 --> 2307.359
with me i really don't i really don't

2305.119 --> 2310.56
understand

2307.359 --> 2312.7999999999997
i've had girls that were like a literal

2310.56 --> 2315.2799999999997
head taller than me i've had smaller

2312.8 --> 2315.28
girls

2315.68 --> 2320.48
one thing yeah well i've even never

2318.48 --> 2322.48
really like

2320.48 --> 2325.28
chubby girls

2322.48 --> 2328.0
but i don't even shy away from that

2325.28 --> 2329.8390000000004
that kind of skin at everything

2328.0 --> 2334.0
that

2329.839 --> 2334.0
i don't understand how i work man

2339.44 --> 2344.64
were they hot though no some of them

2342.16 --> 2346.8799999999997
were not

2344.64 --> 2349.359
i've had a girl so freaking ugly i

2346.88 --> 2352.0
actually told her to put a bag over her

2349.359 --> 2354.88
head as a joke but i secretly meant it

2352.0 --> 2356.96
yeah

2354.88 --> 2359.44
although that was kind of a big regret

2356.96 --> 2361.119
afterward

2359.44 --> 2362.88
that i actually

2361.119 --> 2365.2000000000003
started dating her

2362.88 --> 2366.8
i don't know why i did that because she

2365.2 --> 2369.839
did fall in love with me and i feel

2366.8 --> 2369.8390000000004
really guilty about that

2369.92 --> 2374.32
because i was not i was just like nope

2375.04 --> 2382.32
like i don't care i just want to be

2377.68 --> 2383.2
around a woman i don't care

2382.32 --> 2386.0
yeah

2383.2 --> 2386.0
yeah that's right

2386.16 --> 2391.2
i had an ex-girlfriend this is some time

2388.96 --> 2393.44
ago it was like during scatter dating

2391.2 --> 2396.0
period where i literally had a girl i

2393.44 --> 2400.16
thought was so ugly i told her once to

2396.0 --> 2400.16
put a bag over her head as a joke

2401.68 --> 2408.2
she did actually laugh about that she

2404.16 --> 2408.2
knew she was freaking ugly

2409.92 --> 2415.599
[Music]

2411.839 --> 2415.599
yeah i know what the [ __ ] yeah

2419.28 --> 2424.3190000000004
it's really funny thinking back about it

2421.52 --> 2426.64
though

2424.319 --> 2426.64
ah

2428.8 --> 2431.119
right

2431.599 --> 2435.96
oh that's not nice yeah i know

2441.2 --> 2444.56
the ugly ones are nice though well she

2443.119 --> 2447.2000000000003
was like

2444.56 --> 2449.599
almost like a slave

2447.2 --> 2451.839
like big probably because she's been

2449.599 --> 2454.7200000000003
around men that just treat her like

2451.839 --> 2456.56
absolute dirt and i felt rotten for i

2454.72 --> 2460.3999999999996
was like

2456.56 --> 2463.2
i was pretty much in my prime and i mean

2460.4 --> 2465.52
really freaking attractive okay

2463.2 --> 2467.359
and i was like oh i could be like a god

2465.52 --> 2469.839
to this woman

2467.359 --> 2471.5989999999997
but i'm not gonna like end up with her

2469.839 --> 2474.319
because i would not want to have

2471.599 --> 2476.7200000000003
children with that kind of face

2474.319 --> 2476.72
no way

2476.88 --> 2480.56
and afterward that was a really bad

2479.119 --> 2484.319
decision

2480.56 --> 2484.319
i feel guilty that i did that

2484.4 --> 2491.52
because she was a kind hearted person

2488.319 --> 2493.44
that's kind of hardened up from just men

2491.52 --> 2495.839
treating her like dirt

2493.44 --> 2498.16
and i didn't like that i don't like men

2495.839 --> 2500.4
i don't like how other men treat women a

2498.16 --> 2504.2
lot of the time i really don't

2500.4 --> 2504.2000000000003
it makes me angry

2515.2 --> 2520.8799999999997
right but anyway that's an exception

2517.44 --> 2524.56
though i don't typically go for ugly

2520.88 --> 2529.04
ugly ducks my ex was one of the most

2524.56 --> 2529.04
amazing looking women i've ever seen

2531.92 --> 2537.4
unfortunately inside

2534.4 --> 2537.4
yeah

2537.52 --> 2541.2
she was

2539.2 --> 2542.64
[ __ ] up

2541.2 --> 2544.24
as in

2542.64 --> 2546.0789999999997
egotistical

2544.24 --> 2550.359
and dark

2546.079 --> 2550.3590000000004
and very good at hiding that

2552.72 --> 2557.7999999999997
better in acting than actually living

2576.48 --> 2579.92
i turned up late and wondering what the

2578.16 --> 2584.64
[ __ ] i've me

2579.92 --> 2584.64
yeah we're talking i'm having my uh

2585.92 --> 2590.8
my spring ball moment

2588.319 --> 2592.5
i've met like a lot of frustrations and

2590.8 --> 2595.599
[ __ ] and go

2592.5 --> 2597.68
[Music]

2595.599 --> 2601.28
like crashing into the fences like

2597.68 --> 2601.2799999999997
basically like a bull

2602.079 --> 2606.96
whose balls are itching and just like

2604.4 --> 2610.2000000000003
ramming into the fences that that's me

2606.96 --> 2610.2
right now

2624.48 --> 2627.48
so

2635.599 --> 2638.96
can't live with them can't live with it

2637.92 --> 2641.359
no

2638.96 --> 2644.4
no how about you can't live with them

2641.359 --> 2644.4
just leave it at that

2644.56 --> 2649.119
i've lived 10 years without him it's

2647.2 --> 2650.8799999999997
working just fine

2649.119 --> 2652.96
right

2650.88 --> 2654.1600000000003
then not being able to live without them

2652.96 --> 2656.8
only

2654.16 --> 2658.24
counts for as long as you have actually

2656.8 --> 2660.4
lived with them

2658.24 --> 2661.68
yeah then it's going to be very hard

2660.4 --> 2663.6800000000003
without them

2661.68 --> 2667.68
not so hard

2663.68 --> 2667.68
do i prefer busty women

2669.839 --> 2676.0
no not particularly

2673.119 --> 2678.6400000000003
as i said the shapes of my women have

2676.0 --> 2681.52
been very much over the place one thing

2678.64 --> 2685.04
i i do tend to like

2681.52 --> 2685.04
stand on not literally

2685.52 --> 2689.28
they have to kind of have big a bit of a

2687.599 --> 2693.839
butt

2689.28 --> 2693.8390000000004
not super fat ass but yeah

2695.28 --> 2699.2000000000003
like i don't like it when they look like

2697.599 --> 2700.96
little boys

2699.2 --> 2702.7999999999997
if you know what i mean

2700.96 --> 2704.48
they have to have a bit of hips and i

2702.8 --> 2706.7200000000003
guess that's just an instinctual

2704.48 --> 2709.359
necessity since i have a freaking head

2706.72 --> 2711.359
like a watermelon

2709.359 --> 2714.16
it has to fit

2711.359 --> 2715.2799999999997
my kids have to fit through there

2714.16 --> 2718.3999999999996
right

2715.28 --> 2719.599
so that's a demand and they had yeah

2718.4 --> 2721.76
i

2719.599 --> 2724.0
it is going to be important that they

2721.76 --> 2726.0
breastfeed that that's like super

2724.0 --> 2727.68
essential they don't have to have really

2726.0 --> 2728.8
big breasts for that maybe even better

2727.68 --> 2732.319
if not

2728.8 --> 2736.2000000000003
but they can't be like completely

2732.319 --> 2736.2
inactive like that

2748.72 --> 2751.04
ill

2757.76 --> 2761.8390000000004
that's super gross

2775.599 --> 2780.8
letting down

2777.44 --> 2780.8
what does that even mean

2785.04 --> 2789.839
can anybody translate what that means

2788.0 --> 2793.04
from

2789.839 --> 2797.48
kai from gore

2793.04 --> 2797.48
landing down what does that mean

2807.68 --> 2810.68
so

2835.2 --> 2841.4399999999996
if mama ain't happy nobody happy

2839.119 --> 2844.44
yeah seeking star wars that's fair

2841.44 --> 2844.44
enough

2858.72 --> 2861.72
um

2878.72 --> 2882.9599999999996
i don't even understand what you're

2880.64 --> 2886.24
saying and what you've been attempting

2882.96 --> 2887.839
to say is spelled atrociously cry from

2886.24 --> 2888.5589999999997
gore

2887.839 --> 2890.24
so

2888.559 --> 2893.2400000000002
i don't know what you're blabbering on

2890.24 --> 2893.24
about

2912.4 --> 2916.2400000000002
okay kevlar i don't know what he's

2914.079 --> 2918.4
talking about

2916.24 --> 2918.3999999999996
like

2919.52 --> 2924.319
whatever yeah earth is flat definitely

2928.72 --> 2934.0789999999997
the only curvature should be

2931.359 --> 2934.0789999999997
on a woman

2934.88 --> 2938.48
that's where you want your curvature

2940.319 --> 2948.68
yeah they'd like to call it mother earth

2943.68 --> 2948.68
but she's actually quite flat

2961.68 --> 2963.9199999999996
ha

2964.64 --> 2968.96
a great minds think alike ralph

2966.64 --> 2970.64
rodriguez because i think we pretty much

2968.96 --> 2973.64
said the exact same thing at the same

2970.64 --> 2973.64
time

2985.359 --> 2988.359
uh

3010.88 --> 3013.839
hmm

3061.119 --> 3065.88
women's curves are testable and

3062.88 --> 3065.88
measurable

3070.16 --> 3075.359
i mean you can actually prove their

3072.319 --> 3077.68
geometric horizon

3075.359 --> 3077.68
god

3081.68 --> 3086.2
right let's stop thinking about that

3118.079 --> 3121.079
ah

3125.44 --> 3129.359
all right so anything else

3129.52 --> 3133.7599999999998
i think i like got over it already

3134.8 --> 3139.76
i just needed to

3136.559 --> 3143.44
bash my skull into the fence for a

3139.76 --> 3143.44
couple of times i'm okay now

3147.68 --> 3150.839
new for ryan's coming soon what are you

3149.76 --> 3154.079
talking

3150.839 --> 3157.0789999999997
about new variants of women's curves

3154.079 --> 3157.079
what

3173.2 --> 3176.2
so

3190.88 --> 3197.76
no oh

3192.96 --> 3197.76
oh yeah no nobody cares

3201.28 --> 3205.0400000000004
and i hope that's going to persist to

3203.2 --> 3207.1189999999997
the point where

3205.04 --> 3209.119
like even if they start blabbering on

3207.119 --> 3212.079
about the supposed new variant that

3209.119 --> 3214.079
people will just literally lynch them

3212.079 --> 3217.3590000000004
instead

3214.079 --> 3220.0
like the freaking lying witches that

3217.359 --> 3222.72
they are like oh oh you got new this oh

3220.0 --> 3226.64
oh yeah let's burn him

3222.72 --> 3226.64
burn the lying witch

3227.599 --> 3231.44
with your freaking virus [ __ ]

3230.319 --> 3233.7599999999998
stories

3231.44 --> 3238.7200000000003
burn them

3233.76 --> 3238.7200000000003
burn them on fires

3242.079 --> 3244.4
yeah

3244.64 --> 3252.24
take all their authority all of it

3248.8 --> 3253.76
and if they keep shoveling the lie and

3252.24 --> 3258.16
the panic

3253.76 --> 3264.119
burn them on pyres

3258.16 --> 3264.1189999999997
like the lying witches that they are

3264.64 --> 3271.0
dispensing necromantic lying witches

3284.319 --> 3289.44
required to be stabbed that's a good way

3286.88 --> 3293.48
of saying it yeah

3289.44 --> 3293.48
it should be calling stabbed

3298.079 --> 3302.2400000000002
it's like being jabbed with a

3300.319 --> 3303.119
more gold blade

3302.24 --> 3306.64
right

3303.119 --> 3309.44
oh it's jab oh it's for your health

3306.64 --> 3311.52
if we just inject you with this freaking

3309.44 --> 3313.599
poison

3311.52 --> 3316.64
that technically doesn't even have any

3313.599 --> 3319.119
relation to the conceptual claim we have

3316.64 --> 3322.4
about this medical situation

3319.119 --> 3325.359
and it's better for you

3322.4 --> 3328.319
just just take a little jab of this more

3325.359 --> 3330.0
gold blade it's all right

3328.319 --> 3331.68
i mean

3330.0 --> 3333.599
i mean come on it's

3331.68 --> 3336.319
a king right

3333.599 --> 3339.3590000000004
if a king in the shadow realm

3336.319 --> 3341.68
wants to give you a little jab with a

3339.359 --> 3343.2799999999997
more gold blade well you don't want to

3341.68 --> 3346.16
be a racist

3343.28 --> 3348.559
right you don't want to be irresponsible

3346.16 --> 3352.48
take that more morgle blade

3348.559 --> 3356.1600000000003
in your arm it's good for you

3352.48 --> 3359.4
yeah take the morgul blade jab

3356.16 --> 3359.3999999999996
do it

3365.839 --> 3369.359
i really like that comparison by the way

3367.76 --> 3371.76
i'm going to keep that

3369.359 --> 3374.16
because it is like that

3371.76 --> 3377.1600000000003
suppose the jabs are like more gold

3374.16 --> 3377.16
blades

3393.599 --> 3396.319
right

3394.4 --> 3398.88
yeah bizarre by the way george sanford

3396.319 --> 3402.319
really british columbia all of them

3398.88 --> 3404.48
private practices well what if you just

3402.319 --> 3406.64
basically say oh okay

3404.48 --> 3409.2
well then i'm not a doctor

3406.64 --> 3411.68
i'm just not gonna do that anymore then

3409.2 --> 3413.7599999999998
i'm just gonna do whatever the [ __ ] i'm

3411.68 --> 3416.24
gonna call it

3413.76 --> 3419.6800000000003
[ __ ] your doctor profession then yeah

3416.24 --> 3421.68
i'll just be a healer i'll just rename

3419.68 --> 3424.24
the things i do

3421.68 --> 3427.5989999999997
to completely bypass

3424.24 --> 3431.2799999999997
being a practitioning doctor with that

3427.599 --> 3433.04
stupid jab mandate

3431.28 --> 3436.3590000000004
right

3433.04 --> 3436.359
[ __ ] that

3446.079 --> 3452.079
yeah all of it all of it

3449.119 --> 3454.2400000000002
all those professions

3452.079 --> 3456.799
just say okay

3454.24 --> 3461.359
medical system

3456.799 --> 3463.839
go [ __ ] yourself i hope you all die

3461.359 --> 3467.44
and implode and the medical insurance

3463.839 --> 3470.48
system completely crashes to all hell

3467.44 --> 3473.2000000000003
and we are just gonna be healers

3470.48 --> 3477.2
doing actual good things

3473.2 --> 3479.839
separately from you eugenicist imploding

3477.2 --> 3479.839
psychos

3483.44 --> 3485.76
yeah

3485.839 --> 3490.319
i mean you think

3487.68 --> 3492.96
that you like oh but we have to have

3490.319 --> 3495.359
insurances we have to have hospitals we

3492.96 --> 3497.28
have to have protocols blah blah blah

3495.359 --> 3499.839
no no you don't

3497.28 --> 3502.079
you think you can't be a dentist

3499.839 --> 3504.16
you think you can't basically fix

3502.079 --> 3507.3590000000004
somebody's teeth if you don't have the

3504.16 --> 3510.3999999999996
[ __ ] insurance [ __ ] all of that

3507.359 --> 3513.7599999999998
no you could just do it

3510.4 --> 3516.559
yeah and explain the risks because yeah

3513.76 --> 3517.44
that would be risky yeah things can go

3516.559 --> 3519.28
wrong

3517.44 --> 3521.44
that's what the insurance [ __ ] is all

3519.28 --> 3524.0
for but if you really need it

3521.44 --> 3526.559
you could just do it

3524.0 --> 3529.359
just like that off the record you just

3526.559 --> 3531.44
do the procedure literally nobody has to

3529.359 --> 3533.119
know about it you could set your own

3531.44 --> 3534.88
price you could do it completely off

3533.119 --> 3536.4
record

3534.88 --> 3539.28
done

3536.4 --> 3545.1600000000003
[ __ ] the medical system [ __ ] medical

3539.28 --> 3545.1600000000003
insurance [ __ ] all of it just do it

3555.04 --> 3561.92
goldie mckerman doctors that only know

3557.68 --> 3561.9199999999996
how to prescribe are not doctors

3562.799 --> 3568.16
there aren't you're not a doctor if

3564.64 --> 3568.16
that's the only [ __ ] thing you do

3568.24 --> 3571.2
yeah

3569.04 --> 3574.88
it doesn't make you a doctor if you just

3571.2 --> 3574.8799999999997
prescribe pharmaceuticals

3575.68 --> 3582.799
right a real doctor needs a lot of

3579.44 --> 3582.799
analytical skills

3582.96 --> 3588.0
they need to know the body they need to

3585.68 --> 3590.0
know what's going on out there they need

3588.0 --> 3593.76
to know

3590.0 --> 3596.64
the the age the time frame of what

3593.76 --> 3598.0
people are going through in that period

3596.64 --> 3601.68
and

3598.0 --> 3604.4
figure out why why is this happening in

3601.68 --> 3606.799
this period of time

3604.4 --> 3609.04
right that's what a doctor really needs

3606.799 --> 3611.52
to know

3609.04 --> 3614.4
not what oh somebody's complaining oh

3611.52 --> 3615.2
this is the drug i can pimp them with

3614.4 --> 3617.28
yeah

3615.2 --> 3620.3999999999996
that's not a doctor

3617.28 --> 3620.4
that's a drug dealer

3624.079 --> 3630.6400000000003
literally a drug

3626.319 --> 3633.119
dealer they deal drugs oh pharmaceutical

3630.64 --> 3636.799
mega corporation approved

3633.119 --> 3636.799
yeah drug dealer

3637.44 --> 3641.68
if a doctor just gives you pills

3640.0 --> 3644.079
whenever you complain they're not a

3641.68 --> 3645.7599999999998
doctor they're a drug dealer you

3644.079 --> 3647.28
understand

3645.76 --> 3648.96
just because they're wearing a white

3647.28 --> 3650.3190000000004
coat and they got a piece of paper on

3648.96 --> 3652.88
their wall

3650.319 --> 3657.4
doesn't mean they're actually a doctor

3652.88 --> 3657.4
if they're just dealing drugs

3664.88 --> 3671.359
yeah thank you rob rodriguez indeed

3668.0 --> 3673.68
don't forget to paypal me i need it

3671.359 --> 3675.92
i just found out that my freaking

3673.68 --> 3678.0789999999997
medical insurance which i've been kind

3675.92 --> 3678.079
of

3678.799 --> 3682.319
holding back on the payments just to be

3680.88 --> 3684.2400000000002
able to eat

3682.319 --> 3688.0
but apparently they have just without

3684.24 --> 3691.2
even telling me started like a repayment

3688.0 --> 3693.44
arrangement which i'm very unhappy about

3691.2 --> 3695.839
because that's not the setup that i

3693.44 --> 3698.4
wanted to deal with it with

3695.839 --> 3701.119
so yeah i definitely need the paypal

3698.4 --> 3702.88
support because i'm basically paying off

3701.119 --> 3704.319
these debts that have been growing in

3702.88 --> 3707.04
the last half year that i've been

3704.319 --> 3708.24
telling everybody about like yeah that's

3707.04 --> 3711.2
happening

3708.24 --> 3714.799
well i lost control and now i am paying

3711.2 --> 3714.799
it off whether i like it or not

3715.039 --> 3718.96
so please do support me through the

3717.039 --> 3721.92
paypal

3718.96 --> 3723.44
this is gonna last for like a few months

3721.92 --> 3727.839
and there's nothing i can even do they

3723.44 --> 3727.839
never even gave me a freaking phone call

3738.96 --> 3741.839
all right

3751.599 --> 3756.079
i wish i could write off the medical

3753.68 --> 3756.0789999999997
bills

3757.599 --> 3762.7200000000003
that would be kind of cool

3759.92 --> 3764.64
if i'm like yeah i'm my own doctor

3762.72 --> 3767.64
now i'd like to

3764.64 --> 3767.64
basically

3768.24 --> 3772.64
yeah

3770.319 --> 3776.4
redirect that money i have to pay to

3772.64 --> 3776.4
medical insurance to me

3776.96 --> 3781.92
i wish that would be possible

3779.68 --> 3784.64
because i am not going to go to a doctor

3781.92 --> 3786.88
guys i really want

3784.64 --> 3788.5589999999997

like the only way you're going to get me

3788.559 --> 3792.7200000000003
to a doctor is if i'm like in a terrible

3790.96 --> 3794.88
accident and have lost consciousness and

3792.72 --> 3796.64
you will literally bring me to that

3794.88 --> 3798.96
doctor without me knowing because i'm

3796.64 --> 3800.24
not awake right that's the only way i'm

3798.96 --> 3802.48
ever gonna be

3800.24 --> 3805.52
involved with a freaking doctor because

3854.559 --> 3861.8390000000004
that it sucks

3857.76 --> 3864.4
that freaking medical socialist system

3861.839 --> 3867.359
has led us to this place

3864.4 --> 3869.599
where people get jabbed with poisons and

3867.359 --> 3872.319
die and become crippled and then

3869.599 --> 3874.88
everybody else has to pay for that again

3872.319 --> 3878.319
with more medical costs yeah i don't

3874.88 --> 3881.76
want that i'm sick of that

3878.319 --> 3883.92
but not physically ill though

3881.76 --> 3885.6800000000003
because i take really good care of my

3883.92 --> 3887.839
physical health

3885.68 --> 3889.9199999999996
despite everything yeah despite my

3887.839 --> 3892.64
poverty i take really good care of my

3889.92 --> 3894.7200000000003
own physical health yeah

3892.64 --> 3896.24
like i have

3894.72 --> 3898.72
physical issues

3896.24 --> 3902.0789999999997
but i actually know how to deal with

3898.72 --> 3904.72
them in a way that it's not going to

3902.079 --> 3907.7200000000003
kill me after a certain set period of

3904.72 --> 3907.72
time

3910.64 --> 3914.0789999999997
i don't do doctors

3915.359 --> 3918.96
well i actually really do like female

3917.44 --> 3921.68
doctors

3918.96 --> 3924.559
like i i'll do them

3921.68 --> 3928.64
i'm just not going to be

3924.559 --> 3928.6400000000003
taking their medical services

3928.72 --> 3934.799
right my ex is a dentist

3932.16 --> 3937.44
my really cute

3934.799 --> 3939.0389999999998
roommate is basically studying to become

3937.44 --> 3943.039
a doctor so

3939.039 --> 3949.079
i kind of do like doctors female ones

3943.039 --> 3949.079
i'm just not really in need of a doctor

3953.68 --> 3958.72
and i kind of have preference

3956.64 --> 3961.2799999999997
it seems it's also a strategical

3958.72 --> 3964.72
preference that i like doctor type women

3961.28 --> 3967.2000000000003
why because usually those women are not

3964.72 --> 3968.9599999999996
very good at cooking that's what i found

3967.2 --> 3971.839
my ex was not good at it

3968.96 --> 3974.319
she doesn't seem to be a real star at it

3971.839 --> 3976.88
and that gives me a niche in the

3974.319 --> 3979.359
personal market because i am so it's

3976.88 --> 3981.28
like yeah doctor ladies

3979.359 --> 3984.16
i'm a cook

3981.28 --> 3984.1600000000003
i could do that

3988.24 --> 3994.8799999999997
right now all i need is them for them

3991.039 --> 3999.079
not to be insane squeaky crazy liberals

3994.88 --> 3999.079
and then i'm i'm good

4010.96 --> 4018.119
just tell them you identify as a doctor

4013.92 --> 4018.119
that's just terrible kevlar

4029.119 --> 4034.119
a little crockett by the way logical

4031.119 --> 4034.119
conclusion

4034.64 --> 4038.5989999999997
starting 80 12.

4058.48 --> 4063.119
hmm appendix right okay i get that alias

4061.599 --> 4065.52
g yeah

4063.119 --> 4069.0
when i was a kid i had that too around

4065.52 --> 4069.0
when i was 12.

4076.16 --> 4081.1189999999997
although the whole appendix thing is

4078.64 --> 4083.44
kind of tricky though

4081.119 --> 4085.839
right because the appendix does actually

4083.44 --> 4088.2400000000002
have a function other

4085.839 --> 4090.96
than the garbage the mainstream medical

4088.24 --> 4093.5989999999997
system tells you it has

4090.96 --> 4095.039
it's not to just oh catch

4093.599 --> 4097.92
stuff

4095.039 --> 4099.359
it's actually a very specific type of

4097.92 --> 4103.4400000000005
pocket

4099.359 --> 4107.279
a container that breeds very specific

4103.44 --> 4110.239
think bacteria something

4107.279 --> 4112.96
that's really beneficial

4110.239 --> 4114.48
for your system but it can run into

4112.96 --> 4117.44
trouble

4114.48 --> 4119.599999999999
if your health is not super balanced

4117.44 --> 4122.239
especially when you take vaccines and

4119.6 --> 4124.2390000000005
[ __ ] even the regular ones

4122.239 --> 4127.3589999999995
or if you just eat

4124.239 --> 4132.919999999999
bad things like gmo like then

4127.359 --> 4132.92
it becomes like unstable or something

4133.44 --> 4140.5599999999995
but people that hold on to their

4135.92 --> 4140.56
appendix they're actually better for it

4143.839 --> 4147.92
was a gland that was used to digest raw

4147.04 --> 4150.4
meat

4147.92 --> 4152.64
could be it could be part of that not

4150.4 --> 4152.639999999999
sure

4158.0 --> 4162.799
interesting

4160.96 --> 4164.96
i just know it actually does have a

4162.799 --> 4166.4
function

4164.96 --> 4168.159
but yeah i don't have it either i

4166.4 --> 4171.719
haven't had it since i was

4168.159 --> 4171.719
12 or something

4175.279 --> 4178.279
so

4200.0 --> 4205.84
yeah vestigial but that's

4202.56 --> 4208.4800000000005
the entire idea of vestigial organs or

4205.84 --> 4211.28
whatever is completely idiotic

4208.48 --> 4213.44
there is no vestigial things everything

4211.28 --> 4216.32
has a function everything

4213.44 --> 4218.799999999999
oh you can't figure it out well that

4216.32 --> 4220.4
just means you don't know enough about

4218.8 --> 4221.84
the functions that are already there

4220.4 --> 4223.04
then

4221.84 --> 4224.4800000000005
that's it

4223.04 --> 4227.44
because every

4224.48 --> 4233.639999999999
freaking thing in the body has a

4227.44 --> 4233.639999999999
function every little thing everything

4266.719 --> 4272.64
why are appendixes bursting on people

4269.44 --> 4277.199
all the time good question well because

4272.64 --> 4277.1990000000005
people poison the [ __ ] out of themselves

4279.6 --> 4286.400000000001
if you allow yourself to eat like

4282.8 --> 4288.2390000000005
mainstream brand food and snacks and

4286.4 --> 4291.5199999999995
candy and

4288.239 --> 4293.839999999999
disgusting sugary drinks with aspartame

4291.52 --> 4296.159000000001
and every like all that garbage if you

4293.84 --> 4299.4400000000005
just take any of that

4296.159 --> 4301.759999999999
and you're like take vaccines and [ __ ]

4299.44 --> 4304.719
unnecessarily so

4301.76 --> 4306.88
you're gonna get into trouble and yeah

4304.719 --> 4308.32
typically

4306.88 --> 4312.8
the appendix

4308.32 --> 4316.719
is very sensitive to that sort of thing

4312.8 --> 4319.6
i guess it seems so

4316.719 --> 4319.6
so yeah

4320.64 --> 4327.1990000000005
in a way you could say that

4324.0 --> 4328.48
if it wasn't for surgery then just

4327.199 --> 4331.599999999999
a lot

4328.48 --> 4334.879999999999
more people would die as they would

4331.6 --> 4336.56
naturally in the past yeah because

4334.88 --> 4338.8
poisoning people

4336.56 --> 4342.0
gets them killed

4338.8 --> 4344.08
yeah it's only because that procedure

4342.0 --> 4346.4
it's just kind of like oh yeah yeah

4344.08 --> 4350.239
we're all being poisoned but it's okay

4346.4 --> 4350.239
you know we can just remove that

4350.88 --> 4356.08
yeah

4353.12 --> 4358.08
to kind of cover up how everybody in

4356.08 --> 4361.04
society is being systematically

4358.08 --> 4365.159
encouraged to poison themselves

4361.04 --> 4365.159
and that's shoved under the carpet

4375.76 --> 4379.8
tonsils right

4391.679 --> 4397.0
not everybody can afford decent food

4393.679 --> 4397.0
yeah yeah

4398.08 --> 4400.8
but

4398.88 --> 4403.679
does that mean that they're just gonna

4400.8 --> 4406.2390000000005
eat mcdonald's then

4403.679 --> 4406.96
because yo you can't afford decent food

4406.239 --> 4409.5199999999995
but

4406.96 --> 4410.84
are you then going to just take poison

4409.52 --> 4413.4400000000005
because it's

4410.84 --> 4414.64
cheaper or you're just gonna eat a

4413.44 --> 4417.04
little less

4414.64 --> 4418.64
of the healthy food yeah that's been my

4417.04 --> 4419.76
strategy

4418.64 --> 4421.76
literally

4419.76 --> 4424.320000000001
that's how i started to eat organic it's

4421.76 --> 4426.719
just like oh it is more expensive oh you

4424.32 --> 4429.5199999999995
can buy less of it yeah

4426.719 --> 4432.4800000000005
well then just buy less

4429.52 --> 4434.159000000001
and then you learn to eat less of better

4432.48 --> 4436.48
food

4434.159 --> 4439.599999999999
and it actually works better when i

4436.48 --> 4441.599999999999
started eating organic i ate less and i

4439.6 --> 4444.159000000001
got better for it

4441.6 --> 4447.1990000000005
it's in better form better concentration

4444.159 --> 4447.199
less brain fog

4447.679 --> 4452.4
quicker

4448.8 --> 4454.64
healing time on wounds

4452.4 --> 4456.719
yeah and i ate less

4454.64 --> 4460.719
when i first started eating organic food

4456.719 --> 4462.96
in like the first three four years

4460.719 --> 4466.4
i ate

4462.96 --> 4468.96
half to a third of literal

4466.4 --> 4470.96
amount of weight in food

4468.96 --> 4474.08
that i started out with

4470.96 --> 4476.8
half to a third of that amount

4474.08 --> 4478.8
and i was perfectly fine with that i

4476.8 --> 4483.04
haven't really changed it back i just

4478.8 --> 4485.12
eat less now because i eat organic

4483.04 --> 4487.199
and that works

4485.12 --> 4491.239
it only really doesn't work when you

4487.199 --> 4491.239
don't eat anything at all

4499.36 --> 4506.36
fresh food is pricey in australia wow

4503.04 --> 4506.36
that sucks

4520.719 --> 4524.719
the local councils have been apologizing

4522.8 --> 4525.679
for not putting fluoride in the tap

4524.719 --> 4528.08
water

4525.679 --> 4530.4800000000005
have somebody have people threaten them

4528.08 --> 4532.4
to kill them if they actually double

4530.48 --> 4534.959999999999
down on that

4532.4 --> 4534.96
they should

4535.76 --> 4539.52
literally

4537.28 --> 4542.0
people should step up to them

4539.52 --> 4544.320000000001
hope maybe even like with a bag of

4542.0 --> 4547.04
fluoride with like the

4544.32 --> 4549.84
warnings on it like super lethal poison

4547.04 --> 4551.5199999999995
use protection when handling this

4549.84 --> 4554.159000000001
and then tell them like

4551.52 --> 4556.96
really you want to put this

4554.159 --> 4559.04
back in water yeah

4556.96 --> 4561.12
take a spoon

4559.04 --> 4562.88
yeah you want to double down it take a

4561.12 --> 4566.12
spoon right now

4562.88 --> 4566.12
take it

4583.92 --> 4587.28
what

4584.719 --> 4589.679
would a typical day of eating look like

4587.28 --> 4591.92
for me

4589.679 --> 4591.92
uh

4592.8 --> 4598.64
all right

4594.719 --> 4598.64
well start out with supplements

4598.88 --> 4602.56
b12

4600.88 --> 4603.6
c

4602.56 --> 4605.280000000001
zinc

4603.6 --> 4607.6
and other

4605.28 --> 4611.12
stuff whatever is available

4607.6 --> 4613.360000000001
i'm now having like this mushroom thing

4611.12 --> 4617.44
all kinds of mushrooms in there other

4613.36 --> 4619.759999999999
times i've had like a saupa meadow

4617.44 --> 4622.159
then

4619.76 --> 4624.96
usually i don't really take breakfast

4622.159 --> 4626.879999999999
but if i do i get a croissant and that's

4624.96 --> 4628.88
it just very little i don't i'm not very

4626.88 --> 4631.36
hungry in the mornings and when i am and

4628.88 --> 4634.159000000001
then i eat a lot then i become really

4631.36 --> 4636.4
tired so i just don't eat much in the

4634.159 --> 4640.0
morning or in the afternoon

4636.4 --> 4641.759999999999
and then like usually after my show

4640.0 --> 4643.679
then i get a pizza

4641.76 --> 4646.400000000001
or

4643.679 --> 4649.4400000000005
a sandwich with

4646.4 --> 4651.839999999999
yeah with baked baked eggs and

4649.44 --> 4651.839999999999
mayonnaise

4652.8 --> 4657.6
a couple of beers which yeah it does

4655.04 --> 4660.159
actually nourish you

4657.6 --> 4662.4800000000005
and then yeah later

4660.159 --> 4664.879999999999
in the early evening

4662.48 --> 4667.44
usually or still in the afternoon i get

4664.88 --> 4667.4400000000005
a pizza

4667.6 --> 4670.64
all organic by the way

4669.6 --> 4673.4400000000005
and then

4670.64 --> 4675.1990000000005
later on french fries or some other meal

4673.44 --> 4679.639999999999
that includes meat

4675.199 --> 4679.639999999999
usually like a hamburger or something

4679.92 --> 4685.679
i'll make all of it myself so yeah kind

4682.96 --> 4688.4
of primitive with my food habits it is

4685.679 --> 4691.12
really like super basic stuff but it's

4688.4 --> 4693.759999999999
all organic i make it myself

4691.12 --> 4697.599999999999
never order out

4693.76 --> 4697.6
like i assemble the hamburger

4699.36 --> 4705.92
or whatever it is so that's kind of my

4702.64 --> 4710.04
yeah my food schedule for a day and it's

4705.92 --> 4710.04
kind of the same a lot

4730.4 --> 4735.92
most big cities recycle the water

4733.679 --> 4738.56
not in the netherlands well we do clean

4735.92 --> 4741.679
it out but not literally recycle there's

4738.56 --> 4741.679
so much water here

4741.76 --> 4745.6
this is just

4743.36 --> 4746.639999999999
water netherlands is pretty much just

4745.6 --> 4750.2390000000005
water

4746.64 --> 4752.719
if it wasn't for like the dykes

4750.239 --> 4755.04
from the past it would just be water all

4752.719 --> 4755.04
of it

4761.6 --> 4767.1990000000005
fish oil turmeric yeah yeah i've almost

4764.64 --> 4770.400000000001
forgot yeah before i go to bed i always

4767.199 --> 4772.32
end up with supplements fish oil

4770.4 --> 4776.04
uh

4772.32 --> 4776.04
what's it called again

4781.28 --> 4784.96
yeah some

4782.8 --> 4786.88
probiotics

4784.96 --> 4788.56
uh

4786.88 --> 4791.28
astaxanthin

4788.56 --> 4793.4400000000005
which is like this algia stuff

4791.28 --> 4794.4
which is really good

4793.44 --> 4795.919999999999
and

4794.4 --> 4798.799999999999
uh

4795.92 --> 4800.4
what's the other one spirulina

4798.8 --> 4804.88
that's what i take an evening it's like

4800.4 --> 4806.239
the the oceanic supplement batch

4804.88 --> 4808.400000000001

4806.239 --> 4810.718999999999
literally by the way all of it like fish

4808.4 --> 4812.96
oil

4810.719 --> 4815.28
algae from the ocean

4812.96 --> 4819.84
and

4815.28 --> 4822.08
spirulina which is like seaweed so yeah

4819.84 --> 4825.04
i take the oceanic supplements right

4822.08 --> 4825.04
before bedtime

4826.32 --> 4832.36
and more land-based herbs supplements in

4829.28 --> 4832.36
the morning

4844.32 --> 4847.32
hmm

4860.639 --> 4864.4800000000005
white willow never heard that

4865.6 --> 4870.08
i do know like willow

4867.92 --> 4873.36
juice i even know this from we had a

4870.08 --> 4875.12
willow tree really big one in my old

4873.36 --> 4877.759999999999
mother's house

4875.12 --> 4879.5199999999995
or outside not in the house

4877.76 --> 4882.400000000001
and

4879.52 --> 4884.96
it was taught to me then that it had a

4882.4 --> 4886.719
natural aspirin in it literally it has

4884.96 --> 4889.92
aspirin in it you can make tinctures

4886.719 --> 4891.36
from that this is just a

4889.92 --> 4894.159
just a willow

4891.36 --> 4894.159
willow leaves

4896.96 --> 4900.4800000000005
so yeah i'm not surprised that's good

4898.48 --> 4904.718999999999
for headaches because there's natural

4900.48 --> 4904.718999999999
aspirin in willow in willow juice

4906.8 --> 4911.400000000001
or saps would be called

4917.199 --> 4920.199
hmm

4938.88 --> 4943.6
oh yeah and of course if you're in very

4940.88 --> 4947.28
sunny regions tropical or deserty like

4943.6 --> 4950.719
don't forget about aloe vera plant

4947.28 --> 4951.599999999999
like to just have that plant

4950.719 --> 4954.88
because

4951.6 --> 4956.400000000001
that's really good stuff

4954.88 --> 4958.88
like to

4956.4 --> 4961.44
restore your skin and to protect from

4958.88 --> 4961.4400000000005
sunburn

4969.28 --> 4975.28
besides like aloe vera plants do really

4972.239 --> 4975.28
well in hot

4975.36 --> 4979.4
especially dry environments

4988.56 --> 4992.88
it's kind of funny because like at the

4990.639 --> 4995.12
organic store especially during summer

4992.88 --> 4998.719
time they just have like

4995.12 --> 5001.199
aloe vera leaves that were cut off

4998.719 --> 5004.08
as a whole just fresh leaves for sale in

5001.199 --> 5006.48
like the vegetable section

5004.08 --> 5007.44
and yeah it does sell people do know

5006.48 --> 5009.36
about it

5007.44 --> 5012.4
because yeah it's very easy just get the

5009.36 --> 5015.5199999999995
leaf you cut off

5012.4 --> 5017.44
a layer it's like this gummy

5015.52 --> 5019.4400000000005
juicy stuff

5017.44 --> 5022.48
you just get it and you rub it all over

5019.44 --> 5024.48
you or you could even eat it or both or

5022.48 --> 5029.0
whatever and

5024.48 --> 5029.0
works great it's really healthy

5052.239 --> 5056.5599999999995
yeah goldie mckernan they dude

5054.48 --> 5058.718999999999
rockefeller foundation is doing that

5056.56 --> 5061.1990000000005
sort of thing all the time

5058.719 --> 5064.0
don't listen just don't

5061.199 --> 5066.799999999999
don't be a superstitious idiot

5064.0 --> 5070.0
and follow the necromancers

5066.8 --> 5072.56
with their flawed short-term extreme

5070.0 --> 5074.4
procedures

5072.56 --> 5077.120000000001
that are like the whole allopathic

5074.4 --> 5080.638999999999
medical system is all about just quick

5077.12 --> 5083.599999999999
quick in extreme situations like oh

5080.639 --> 5085.76
it is never about just holistic like oh

5083.6 --> 5088.320000000001
maybe you don't want to base your

5085.76 --> 5092.08
actions purely on

5088.32 --> 5094.4
specific niche life or death situations

5092.08 --> 5096.32
because that's not always what's going

5094.4 --> 5099.679
on right

5096.32 --> 5102.88
i just want to approach it holistically

5099.679 --> 5105.28
no no no just the protocols just follow

5102.88 --> 5108.2390000000005
the protocols

5105.28 --> 5110.0
because they've been written

5108.239 --> 5112.48
right

5110.0 --> 5116.159
better to use fallacy than nothing at

5112.48 --> 5116.159
all that's pretty much what that is

5120.0 --> 5124.0
really it's not even a joke saying that

5122.56 --> 5126.639
that's that's kind of what it is the

5124.0 --> 5128.96
allopathic medical system better to do

5126.639 --> 5132.159000000001
something completely fallacious

5128.96 --> 5133.92
than to just do nothing at all

5132.159 --> 5136.159
although there's still plenty of things

5133.92 --> 5137.679
that they literally do nothing at all

5136.159 --> 5140.719
about there are

5137.679 --> 5143.1990000000005
like typical chronic diseases that do

5140.719 --> 5146.159
pop up more and more and more

5143.199 --> 5148.08
that they just they're like there is no

5146.159 --> 5149.28
thing they can do with it they literally

5148.08 --> 5150.88
will be like

5149.28 --> 5152.96
we don't know

5150.88 --> 5154.719
you could try the alternative

5152.96 --> 5156.88
if you're lucky if you're lucky and have

5154.719 --> 5157.76
a doctor that would actually say that

5156.88 --> 5159.92
right

5157.76 --> 5163.04
just try something alternative we don't

5159.92 --> 5163.04
have anything for this

5176.639 --> 5180.04
what the hell

5195.28 --> 5199.84
i can send you all the big fat alloy

5197.679 --> 5203.52
vera leaves you want well

5199.84 --> 5203.52
i don't really use it that much

5205.12 --> 5210.5599999999995
i mean if i'd really want one i would

5207.44 --> 5212.638999999999
just go to the organic grocery store and

5210.56 --> 5214.8
get a fresh leaf because they do sell

5212.639 --> 5214.8
them

5215.12 --> 5220.5599999999995
and yeah this is not really the

5216.639 --> 5220.56
environment to like keep a plant

5220.639 --> 5225.84
because in the winter it's just not

5223.6 --> 5228.08
yeah it would start to rot probably out

5225.84 --> 5228.08
here

5231.679 --> 5236.52
oh magpies

5233.52 --> 5236.52
bathing

5248.0 --> 5251.88
so leave already

5273.44 --> 5278.0
people used to steal alloy from your

5275.92 --> 5281.32
yard okay

5278.0 --> 5281.32
that's rude

5302.0 --> 5307.0
oh

5302.96 --> 5307.0
now the other one's in there

5311.679 --> 5317.04
it's gone again

5313.92 --> 5318.0
oh did my camera just freeze yep yes it

5317.04 --> 5321.0
did

5318.0 --> 5321.0
thanks

5327.75 --> 5331.08
[Music]

5330.56 --> 5332.2390000000005
what the

5331.08 --> 5333.5
[Music]

5332.239 --> 5336.159
hello

5333.5 --> 5339.159
[Music]

5336.159 --> 5339.159
dude

5357.12 --> 5360.12
mm-hmm

5399.36 --> 5401.679
hmm

5405.28 --> 5412.28
anyway i feel a lot calmer don't i

5408.0 --> 5412.28
compared to the start of the show

5421.92 --> 5426.0
if i bump into like girls when i'm like

5424.719 --> 5429.199
this

5426.0 --> 5429.199
everything works out

5429.52 --> 5434.120000000001
it's only really when i'm like hmm

5435.04 --> 5440.88
bash into that gate that's when like it

5437.84 --> 5440.88
just never works

5442.0 --> 5446.159
but if i'm like oh

5444.0 --> 5447.28
finally i'm done with that

5446.159 --> 5449.44
then

5447.28 --> 5452.48
girls actually start to like look at me

5449.44 --> 5455.839999999999
from the corner of their eyes

5452.48 --> 5457.678999999999
or at least i'd like to think so

5455.84 --> 5459.84
it used to be like that

5457.679 --> 5462.08
i don't know man

5459.84 --> 5464.8
i don't understand why women find me

5462.08 --> 5466.96
attractive sometimes or why they don't i

5464.8 --> 5469.84
don't don't get it

5466.96 --> 5469.84
i just know that

5470.239 --> 5477.5599999999995
what i'm not so frustrated they tend to

5472.8 --> 5477.56
like approach me a lot easier

5480.239 --> 5486.48
by the way yeah i don't really typically

5483.679 --> 5486.4800000000005
approach women

5488.0 --> 5491.84
unless they can like

5492.4 --> 5498.4
figure out a couple of things to talk

5494.8 --> 5498.400000000001
about with them specifically

5499.44 --> 5503.04
that's not just like like hey you would

5501.36 --> 5504.799999999999
have sex or something

5503.04 --> 5506.8
right don't do that

5504.8 --> 5509.679
i don't do that

5506.8 --> 5509.679
it doesn't really work

5510.719 --> 5516.2390000000005
i mean it might work but

5512.8 --> 5516.2390000000005
always end up regretting that

5516.96 --> 5521.679
usually if i say something like that

5519.92 --> 5523.92
then

5521.679 --> 5527.28
women might do that and then afterward

5523.92 --> 5530.0
i'm like hey but i actually want more

5527.28 --> 5532.88
than just sex and then they're like yeah

5530.0 --> 5535.44
but you'd sad sex so now i cut myself

5532.88 --> 5538.2390000000005
off emotionally

5535.44 --> 5539.678999999999
at least that what used to happen

5538.239 --> 5542.5599999999995
my teens

5539.679 --> 5542.56
laid teens

5545.04 --> 5548.719
i don't know man

5546.639 --> 5552.92
i need to stop talking about it and just

5548.719 --> 5552.92
let things happen out there

5563.44 --> 5568.4
also i might want to adapt my attire

5566.8 --> 5570.2390000000005
which is very

5568.4 --> 5572.48
tough for me

5570.239 --> 5575.04
because i've been literally where and

5572.48 --> 5579.36
this is not just oh it says literally no

5575.04 --> 5580.4
literally wearing the same attire for 20

5579.36 --> 5582.0
years

5580.4 --> 5583.839999999999
non-stop

5582.0 --> 5586.88
literally the same

5583.84 --> 5588.88
it's very tough to let that go

5586.88 --> 5589.6
because i don't really know outside of

5588.88 --> 5591.36
that

5589.6 --> 5593.76
attire like what

5591.36 --> 5596.5599999999995
my identity even is

5593.76 --> 5596.56
i don't know

5596.96 --> 5600.52
it's not a joke

5602.8 --> 5607.360000000001
find a nice lady to share a croissant

5605.12 --> 5607.36
with

5612.48 --> 5616.12
sure why not

5619.199 --> 5622.08
i i would

5622.159 --> 5627.28
really enjoy like a picnic date or

5624.88 --> 5627.28
something

5628.84 --> 5632.32
just a

5630.0 --> 5635.84
piece of cloth somewhere maybe even down

5632.32 --> 5638.4
there you know in this beautiful weather

5635.84 --> 5641.04
and just like a bit of a drink and some

5638.4 --> 5644.159
food some snacks that i made or i got

5641.04 --> 5647.36
that i know are great and then just like

5644.159 --> 5647.36
frolic around a little

5648.159 --> 5651.839999999999
need to stop talking about it

5652.639 --> 5655.84
and just let it happen

5655.92 --> 5661.36
you need to wear a nice bright hawaiian

5658.719 --> 5663.52
shirt what

5661.36 --> 5665.759999999999
no

5663.52 --> 5665.76
no

5666.239 --> 5669.199
no

5667.12 --> 5673.08
no i don't wear colors

5669.199 --> 5673.08
i don't do that anymore

5673.36 --> 5677.36
but

5674.56 --> 5678.8
what i might do

5677.36 --> 5681.44
is

5678.8 --> 5681.4400000000005
kind of just

5682.719 --> 5687.84
show another side

5685.36 --> 5687.839999999999
right

5689.53 --> 5692.6089999999995
[Music]

5696.96 --> 5701.4
i mean i know this looks good

5701.84 --> 5706.400000000001
you could do that

5703.44 --> 5708.719
but i'd need like proper pants

5706.4 --> 5710.96
because yeah black i like my black pants

5708.719 --> 5714.08
they're over 10 years old and

5710.96 --> 5716.4800000000005
15 years old what the [ __ ]

5714.08 --> 5718.48
they're patchy as [ __ ] they don't really

5716.48 --> 5720.959999999999
work with the shirt like this i'd need

5718.48 --> 5726.04
like a couple of jeans or something in

5720.96 --> 5726.04
that direction i don't have it right now

5728.48 --> 5734.879999999999
although i do have like my shorts

5731.679 --> 5737.52
but they're black too but that works

5734.88 --> 5737.52
that's fine

5738.0 --> 5743.8
my my summer clothing is like pretty

5740.8 --> 5743.8
manageable

5744.719 --> 5750.679
it's not like oh what a weirdo no not at

5747.679 --> 5750.679
all

5761.28 --> 5765.599999999999
sounds like i'm doing it rough matey

5763.44 --> 5767.04
yeah no [ __ ]

5765.6 --> 5769.119000000001
dude i've got

5767.04 --> 5770.88
shoes

5769.119 --> 5772.48
that are like

5770.88 --> 5776.0
it's a miracle they haven't just

5772.48 --> 5776.0
completely disintegrated

5776.48 --> 5780.879999999999
they're so freaking old i really need

5778.719 --> 5783.28
new shoes i need a new jacket it's

5780.88 --> 5785.119
literally just starting to turn into a

5783.28 --> 5787.199
ghost

5785.119 --> 5789.199
into a wraith like it's

5787.199 --> 5790.799999999999
like all

5789.199 --> 5793.5199999999995
cut up

5790.8 --> 5795.119000000001
it has a weird little thing about that

5793.52 --> 5799.4400000000005
right

5795.119 --> 5802.0
but i don't want to look like a wraith

5799.44 --> 5805.919999999999
gothy type i don't want i don't i'm not

5802.0 --> 5805.92
even attracted to goths anymore

5807.199 --> 5812.48
they would be attracted to me

5810.0 --> 5814.239
i'm not attracted to that

5812.48 --> 5817.04
anymore

5814.239 --> 5818.159
i i'm sorry i ever was

5817.04 --> 5820.4
really

5818.159 --> 5824.5199999999995
it's never really gotten me anything

5820.4 --> 5824.5199999999995
other than maybe a few squirts

5834.239 --> 5838.239
no what i like the most are are women

5836.719 --> 5840.639
that

5838.239 --> 5842.879999999999
basically a giant bouquet of flowers

5840.639 --> 5844.159000000001
that like to wear dresses with a lot of

5842.88 --> 5846.159000000001
flowers

5844.159 --> 5850.08
patterns and colors and

5846.159 --> 5852.48
to contrast yeah that's what i want

5850.08 --> 5854.4
a woman that's like gloriously female

5852.48 --> 5856.32
with like flowery

5854.4 --> 5859.44
style dresses

5856.32 --> 5860.5599999999995
and then i'm next to it like all black

5859.44 --> 5863.678999999999
and white

5860.56 --> 5863.679
that's what i want

5863.76 --> 5869.280000000001
that works really well

5867.119 --> 5871.36
then i can feel like i'm the man i'm the

5869.28 --> 5873.679
protector and she's a beautiful delicate

5871.36 --> 5876.639
flower

5873.679 --> 5879.76
that's not necessarily weak delicate but

5876.639 --> 5882.76
right you know what i mean

5879.76 --> 5882.76
eh

5894.08 --> 5898.5599999999995
what are you talking about gum nut man

5900.4 --> 5907.28
like you're

5902.56 --> 5907.280000000001
a spoiled dude you know smelling

5908.4 --> 5912.719
i'm a hottie just get out there

5910.719 --> 5916.92
thank you goalie

5912.719 --> 5916.92
that's a nice thing to say

5929.52 --> 5937.639
can i put aside a small amount of money

5932.0 --> 5937.639
no no i can't steamy traveler

5938.0 --> 5943.76
yeah you can't really put aside money to

5940.96 --> 5946.719
save for something specifically when

5943.76 --> 5948.320000000001
you're literally simultaneously growing

5946.719 --> 5951.119
more debt

5948.32 --> 5954.239
and running out of food money no no you

5951.119 --> 5955.44
can't put money aside

5954.239 --> 5956.48
then

5955.44 --> 5960.879999999999
get it

5956.48 --> 5960.879999999999
doesn't work like that yeah i can't

5962.8 --> 5969.76
i need to have i need to make more money

5965.199 --> 5972.0
that's it there's nothing else i can do

5969.76 --> 5974.4800000000005
so either somehow

5972.0 --> 5976.719
i get a wider audience i get more of you

5974.48 --> 5979.759999999999
guys supporting me

5976.719 --> 5982.4
or i don't and i'm just gonna wait until

5979.76 --> 5984.96
literally the clothes start falling off

5982.4 --> 5987.36
my body because of wearing

5984.96 --> 5990.719
and tearing and that's it that's the

5987.36 --> 5993.599999999999
only choices i have right now

5990.719 --> 5996.4
or i'd have to radically rearrange my

5993.6 --> 5998.400000000001
life somehow figure out how to get a

5996.4 --> 6001.199
career that makes me more money than my

5998.4 --> 6003.839999999999
social welfare income and somehow

6001.199 --> 6005.839999999999
survive through that build up

6003.84 --> 6008.08
a little

6005.84 --> 6010.4800000000005
and then maybe get some new clothes

6008.08 --> 6011.76
after like two years

6010.48 --> 6014.718999999999
right

6011.76 --> 6016.56
not having the ability to do a show like

6014.719 --> 6019.679
i'm doing right now

6016.56 --> 6021.679
probably never again

6019.679 --> 6024.08
because i will not be able to build up

6021.679 --> 6026.88
the motivation to go back if i ever did

6024.08 --> 6026.88
something like that

6031.52 --> 6037.719
so yeah either my audience

6034.239 --> 6037.718999999999
grows bigger

6038.32 --> 6042.159
more people visit my chat more people

6040.719 --> 6043.52
support me

6042.159 --> 6045.599999999999
and then

6043.52 --> 6046.4800000000005
i will grow out of it i will grow out of

6045.6 --> 6048.88
debt

6046.48 --> 6051.759999999999
i will get new clothes and then

6048.88 --> 6054.08
eventually i'll even have like luxury

6051.76 --> 6056.0
money to spare for like trinkets or

6054.08 --> 6058.4
things i want to show

6056.0 --> 6061.6
on my show yeah

6058.4 --> 6066.08
but that's gonna take a lot more income

6061.6 --> 6068.639
as in at least double of everything

6066.08 --> 6068.639
at least

6069.52 --> 6075.119000000001
and yeah it doesn't seem like you guys

6072.239 --> 6077.36
have that much despair so don't blame

6075.119 --> 6077.36
you

6077.6 --> 6080.96
right it was meant to be

6081.28 --> 6085.5199999999995
i'm a flat earther

6083.04 --> 6087.679
i'm in in a niche little corner people

6085.52 --> 6090.4800000000005
even the ones that want to throw money

6087.679 --> 6092.639
at people they're not gonna find me

6090.48 --> 6094.5599999999995
and if they find me there's a big chance

6092.639 --> 6096.8
that they don't want to throw money at

6094.56 --> 6099.84
me because they only like to throw money

6096.8 --> 6101.92
at people that tell them the lies they

6099.84 --> 6103.679
want to hear because there's a lot of

6101.92 --> 6105.6
those out there

6103.679 --> 6108.639
and i do not

6105.6 --> 6108.639
abide by that

6109.44 --> 6113.119
so

6110.639 --> 6117.28
this is what it is this is where i'm at

6113.119 --> 6117.28
this is all there is to it

6119.44 --> 6124.96

internet presence oh oh well not no

6165.84 --> 6169.52
faith in my internet presence

6168.0 --> 6172.08
except

6169.52 --> 6172.080000000001
why not

6172.56 --> 6178.080000000001
i still have ideas that are going to be

6175.76 --> 6179.6
the future you understand

6178.08 --> 6183.04
it's going to be

6179.6 --> 6184.639
now if i ever get any sort of credit in

6183.04 --> 6186.719
any way

6184.639 --> 6189.52
that's a whole different matter yeah i'm

6186.719 --> 6190.88
i'm very confident they'll have no

6189.52 --> 6194.56
problem

6190.88 --> 6197.04
just letting me keep choking and choking

6194.56 --> 6199.280000000001
and going nuttier and naughtier and

6197.04 --> 6200.8
angrier and angrier

6199.28 --> 6202.719
until i'm out of the way and then

6200.8 --> 6206.4800000000005
they'll just steal

6202.719 --> 6209.36
every freaking idea i put down take some

6206.48 --> 6211.839999999999
[ __ ] freemason weenie [ __ ] gay

6209.36 --> 6213.92
piece of [ __ ] and then

6211.84 --> 6216.0
he made it up oh look he's written a

6213.92 --> 6219.1990000000005
book about it oh yeah and he'll just

6216.0 --> 6221.84
steal everything i've ever said yeah i

6219.199 --> 6223.839999999999
have absolutely no doubt in my mind that

6221.84 --> 6225.52
it'll do that

6223.84 --> 6227.6
yeah

6225.52 --> 6232.6
but my ideas

6227.6 --> 6232.6
are the future they are

6232.639 --> 6236.0
yeah

6233.52 --> 6240.0
because i'm right i'm right about a

6236.0 --> 6242.08
whole bunch of very high-end ideas that

6240.0 --> 6244.56
nobody talks about

6242.08 --> 6248.88
either because they're scared or they

6244.56 --> 6250.320000000001
literally don't understand

6248.88 --> 6252.96
not because they don't want to

6250.32 --> 6255.92
understand but because they can't

6252.96 --> 6256.88
understand at this point because i'm too

6255.92 --> 6259.36
soon

6256.88 --> 6261.28
i lay down things that are a little

6259.36 --> 6262.799999999999
ahead of the road that most people just

6261.28 --> 6265.5199999999995
can't handle

6262.8 --> 6266.8
like the entire holographic celestial

6265.52 --> 6270.159000000001
skies

6266.8 --> 6271.1990000000005
is something that most people just can't

6270.159 --> 6274.159
handle

6271.199 --> 6277.04
no matter how freaking smart they seem

6274.159 --> 6280.08
they just can't grasp it they just can't

6277.04 --> 6281.84
it's like no no no no it just can't be

6280.08 --> 6283.44
it has to be in a position it has to be

6281.84 --> 6285.28
physical literal

6283.44 --> 6288.638999999999
you just can't handle it

6285.28 --> 6290.08
right but i know i'm right i know it

6288.639 --> 6293.04
i'll freaking

6290.08 --> 6294.08
bet my life on it

6293.04 --> 6296.32
yeah

6294.08 --> 6299.679
because i know i'm right

6296.32 --> 6300.5599999999995
it's the future i'm early nobody gives a

6299.679 --> 6302.719
[ __ ]

6300.56 --> 6305.92
i'm not gonna get credit for it i'll

6302.719 --> 6308.08
just have some freaking gay wanker take

6305.92 --> 6310.4800000000005
the credit for everything i've done once

6308.08 --> 6313.36
i'm out of the way and then i everybody

6310.48 --> 6316.239
can just forget i ever existed yeah but

6313.36 --> 6318.799999999999
what i'm talking about is the future

6316.239 --> 6321.839999999999
because it's real and i'm right and i

6318.8 --> 6324.56
know i am and there's nothing anybody in

6321.84 --> 6325.92
this [ __ ] world can do about that i'm

6324.56 --> 6327.92
right

6325.92 --> 6330.719
about my ideas

6327.92 --> 6334.08
nobody can take that away from me

6330.719 --> 6334.08
not even god

6337.44 --> 6340.32
because i'm with him

6340.4 --> 6345.839999999999
