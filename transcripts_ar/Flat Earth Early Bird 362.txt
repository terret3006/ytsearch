235.56 --> 239.27
yesterday as well after the debates

240.62 --> 249.15
Karen was going life and caught a troll

243.17 --> 252.75

caught a troll scouring at at the actual

252.75 --> 260.0
conference getting yeah live stream

255.9 --> 260.0
exposed was pretty epic

264.84 --> 275.53999999999996
I just got closer to pronounce

268.04 --> 279.91900000000004
pronouncing your surname correctly okay

275.54 --> 279.91900000000004

is it like since your finish right is it

288.33 --> 295.979
like a really older name from yeah

293.31 --> 297.99
native tribes because it almost sounds a

295.979 --> 302.039
bit Native American in it in its way

297.99 --> 303.01
that that's how I interpreted in my mind

302.039 --> 306.51
I don't know

303.01 --> 306.51
[Music]

310.1 --> 313.39000000000004

437.57 --> 444.05
what I was just walking in the forest

440.35 --> 448.01000000000005
exactly like that footage from the that

444.05 --> 451.39

I have to a care and B since you're

520.409 --> 526.14
hey Doc Michaels a doc Michael

550.39 --> 562.42
really Georgia Netan you got kicked out

568.81 --> 572.01

573.18 --> 576.28
[Music]

580.41 --> 589.0699999999999
do you mind if I call you up Karen over

586.53 --> 589.0699999999999
Skype

597.519 --> 600.779
he's gotta find you first

600.9 --> 604.049
[Music]

608.769 --> 611.769
never

611.9 --> 615.09
[Music]

626.62 --> 631.2090000000001
well Lori did they have tickets

654.61 --> 660.97
slipping words onto George again just

658.31 --> 660.9699999999999
got a notification

677.319 --> 684.559
well you know what Laurie you know what

681.459 --> 687.92
yeah you maybe all complaining pants and

684.559 --> 689.779
look I'm gonna presuppose now because

687.92 --> 691.639
I'm not really getting any solid

689.779 --> 694.6
information here just a bunch of back

691.639 --> 700.309
and forth bickering and complaining and

694.6 --> 705.109
not a lot of info right so if they got

700.309 --> 707.749
kicked out right even if they had

705.109 --> 709.009
tickets there must be a good reason for

707.749 --> 712.669
that

709.009 --> 715.549
I could think of one mainly for example

712.669 --> 719.389
that Owen Benjamin actually has decided

715.549 --> 722.899
to show up and you don't want to risk

719.389 --> 727.119
him getting into an incident by being

722.899 --> 729.649
pissed off by these guys some severe way

727.119 --> 733.6990000000001
because then he might never come again

729.649 --> 736.309
so that I don't know that seems like a

733.699 --> 739.449
tactical decision that I would probably

736.309 --> 743.929
make if I was among the decision makers

739.449 --> 746.269
but yeah beside that I have no idea what

743.929 --> 749.54
happened other than that George net knew

746.269 --> 753.79
cut filmed live and he looked really

749.54 --> 756.11
uncomfortable that's it

753.79 --> 759.4989999999999
and he got light

756.11 --> 763.429
yeah caught caught lying to the camera

759.499 --> 766.639
once again and that is probably what

763.429 --> 769.61
sleeping Warriors doing his neck his

766.639 --> 775.239
current livestream about or does not

769.61 --> 778.489

809.54 --> 816.38

814.1 --> 818.03
he was still in the middle of thing and

816.38 --> 820.61
I didn't know the rules and it was just

818.03 --> 823.76
screwing around that's a long time ago

820.61 --> 825.62

sleeping warrior uploaded some five

1183.609 --> 1201.58
minutes ago about Georgia net nuke and

1192.149 --> 1203.649
the run-in he had Oh Laurie oh now

1201.58 --> 1206.879
you're like you know look at the baller

1203.649 --> 1208.4899999999998
square room look at the ball or squirrel

1206.879 --> 1211.6299999999999
squirrel morning

1208.49 --> 1211.63
[Music]

1213.059 --> 1216.389
you're lying

1220.1 --> 1223.3899999999999
[Music]

1246.57 --> 1255.87
no no you are not squirming with me

1251.24 --> 1261.18
Laurie I'm not squirming with you I'm

1255.87 --> 1265.35
just showing you what's going on every

1261.18 --> 1270.69
time another baller is just seriously

1265.35 --> 1273.6599999999999
exposed on record and the conscious

1270.69 --> 1278.49
realization of what that means to all of

1273.66 --> 1280.71
you and then you start the squirm and

1278.49 --> 1289.17
then you have to reflect it all so it's

1280.71 --> 1292.79
no we're lying no no no no ya can be why

1289.17 --> 1292.79
not it's not that long

1296.08 --> 1302.04
oh okay does really

1306.5 --> 1317.169
really okay

1328.58 --> 1331.97
all right

1336.08 --> 1344.1799999999998
yeah that's that's probably gonna be a

1338.63 --> 1347.0300000000002
heavy one because I know in the

1344.18 --> 1350.39
petrochemical industry there is a lot of

1347.03 --> 1353.69
side product waste and it's a massive

1350.39 --> 1356.24
problem a problem that in my opinion

1353.69 --> 1361.01
does not directly warrant that we should

1356.24 --> 1365.84
stop doing it altogether but there

1361.01 --> 1370.43
should be so yeah some focus on this

1365.84 --> 1373.6999999999998
these side products and trying to find a

1370.43 --> 1378.76
better resolution for them so they can

1373.7 --> 1383.54
either be used and not yeah prevent

1378.76 --> 1386.33
things say when you transform materials

1383.54 --> 1388.31
sometimes what what typical result will

1386.33 --> 1391.55
be is that a vast majority will be

1388.31 --> 1395.09
neutralized but then there is a a small

1391.55 --> 1397.19
side piece that is much more toxic even

1395.09 --> 1399.56
that's left over that that's true toxic

1397.19 --> 1402.23
waste and the further you go the more

1399.56 --> 1407.4199999999998
problematic it becomes so that should

1402.23 --> 1409.73
hopefully be prevented in my opinion but

1407.42 --> 1412.88
I think that a lot of these chemicals

1409.73 --> 1416.6
that are now just considered as ways

1412.88 --> 1419.1200000000001
they could probably be used to just

1416.6 --> 1422.1399999999999
imagine how much of that stuff there

1419.12 --> 1427.61
must must be around must mean like

1422.14 --> 1432.0500000000002
millions and millions of gallons around

1427.61 --> 1434.9599999999998
the world of just this toxic [ __ ] that

1432.05 --> 1440.8999999999999
nobody really knows what to do about it

1434.96 --> 1443.57
in barrels in places what if we could

1440.9 --> 1447.6200000000001
find a way to transform this into some

1443.57 --> 1450.56
kind of useful product well that sounds

1447.62 --> 1455.3899999999999
kind of hopeful but I don't know that's

1450.56 --> 1459.2
just it that is my issue with every time

1455.39 --> 1462.89
this climate change [ __ ] goes on co2

1459.2 --> 1466.99
olo declares he's already died know I'm

1462.89 --> 1470.1100000000001
always I find it hot just offensive

1466.99 --> 1473.38
because it is not the real problem the

1470.11 --> 1475.24
real problem is the toxic side waste

1473.38 --> 1478.8090000000002
especially the ones that keeps on

1475.24 --> 1483.419
building up there must be figured out

1478.809 --> 1483.4189999999999
some kind of progression concerning this

1488.1 --> 1497.83
or eventually yeah it's gonna grow out

1493.809 --> 1500.3799999999999
of control in a way that it's just if it

1497.83 --> 1504.58
just keeps some continuing exactly like

1500.38 --> 1506.71
it is it's gonna build up so fast that

1504.58 --> 1509.74
potential cataclysms could at some point

1506.71 --> 1512.1100000000001
and then happen not another climate

1509.74 --> 1514.14
change caused Cataclysm but just like

1512.11 --> 1517.0
say for example the earthquake and oops

1514.14 --> 1519.94
it was a little bit too much and this

1517.0 --> 1524.88
certain storage area of all that [ __ ]

1519.94 --> 1527.89
suddenly breaks and oh my god like

1524.88 --> 1530.2890000000002
thousands of square miles of ground are

1527.89 --> 1533.1100000000001
suddenly so extremely polluted it can

1530.289 --> 1535.96
never grow anything alive again that

1533.11 --> 1538.99
sort of [ __ ] will start to happen if if

1535.96 --> 1546.3990000000001
it continues forever that's always been

1538.99 --> 1549.76
my view and that's why I just want an

1546.399 --> 1553.3899999999999
adaptation an evolution not an evolution

1549.76 --> 1555.899
based on taking the foot of the gas

1553.39 --> 1560.8300000000002
necessary literally and metaphorically

1555.899 --> 1567.25
but just figuring out and more sensible

1560.83 --> 1569.6999999999998
and result for the whole chemical

1567.25 --> 1577.84
processes within the chemical industry

1569.7 --> 1579.6100000000001
this is your that's probably a lot of

1577.84 --> 1583.11
chemists out there that have this kind

1579.61 --> 1583.11
of thing in their back of their minds

1589.35 --> 1592.35
yeah

1623.5 --> 1634.7
right well interesting warrant Evans

1628.93 --> 1637.46
yeah well there should be a so that is

1634.7 --> 1641.3600000000001
exactly a folk a focus point why should

1637.46 --> 1644.78
there should be a focus if it is too

1641.36 --> 1648.4399999999998
expensive to neutralize and refine the

1644.78 --> 1650.75
chemicals so that effectively companies

1648.44 --> 1654.74
for whatever reason will secretly or

1650.75 --> 1657.08
illegally start to dump it then there

1654.74 --> 1663.25
must be some way it's figured out how to

1657.08 --> 1663.25
do it more cheaply that is the solution

1665.14 --> 1678.6100000000001
or to somehow make it cheaper to prevent

1671.81 --> 1678.61
that [ __ ] from happening I don't know

1680.549 --> 1684.09
Erin Brockovich

1686.83 --> 1693.1299999999999
oh please now I've seen enough of all

1691.45 --> 1694.92
that war in Athens I wasn't readily

1693.13 --> 1702.0400000000002
deeply immersed in the whole

1694.92 --> 1705.22
environmentalism yeah the first half of

1702.04 --> 1708.03
my life a lot of nature documentaries I

1705.22 --> 1710.95
had just had a lot of interest in

1708.03 --> 1713.47
understanding nature and nature

1710.95 --> 1723.25
conservation and I have a great natural

1713.47 --> 1725.23
care for nature I don't just like it and

1723.25 --> 1730.57
I think that most people just don't take

1725.23 --> 1733.69
it serious enough and that that creates

1730.57 --> 1735.28
a lot of aggravation of the problems oh

1733.69 --> 1736.99
by the way thank you ego playing the

1735.28 --> 1740.11
anchor okay

1736.99 --> 1743.46
I think I can give you four of these

1740.11 --> 1747.61
free cool thanks

1743.46 --> 1751.65
and yeah thanks for two x two dollar

1747.61 --> 1751.6499999999999
super donation that's nice three

1755.73 --> 1765.69
ah Tom Parker no no I don't really fish

1762.32 --> 1770.269
my dad used to I it was never really my

1765.69 --> 1770.269
thing but I know

1774.57 --> 1780.9199999999998
it all depends on where are you gonna

1779.61 --> 1785.61
fish

1780.92 --> 1788.27
what are those fish gonna be eating you

1785.61 --> 1791.9099999999999
know I do eat fish oil yeah it might be

1788.27 --> 1794.4
vegetarian overall but and it don't make

1791.91 --> 1802.3500000000001
fish meat or anything but I do take fish

1794.4 --> 1805.2800000000002
oil so I wouldn't yeah if things may

1802.35 --> 1807.78
collapse at some point I might fall back

1805.28 --> 1810.42
partially I'm fishing if I'd have to or

1807.78 --> 1812.34
if I'd go eventually in some kind of

1810.42 --> 1815.0600000000002
homestead situation I don't know if I

1812.34 --> 1818.22
ever arrived there but I hope so

1815.06 --> 1826.1699999999998
surrounded by nature then I wow it would

1818.22 --> 1829.6200000000001
be pretty cool if I'd have a pond for

1826.17 --> 1831.51
many reasons by the way that so many

1829.62 --> 1834.609
things you can do

1831.51 --> 1834.609
[Music]

1840.78 --> 1843.35
yeah

1846.55 --> 1850.2
Wow really your plane anchor that's

1848.59 --> 1853.8899999999999
that's weird

1850.2 --> 1853.89
but yeah thank you

1869.14 --> 1875.95
that buildin pup voted green 3 well we

1873.25 --> 1882.67
used to be a green folding family back

1875.95 --> 1884.8300000000002
in the day when the green left as

1882.67 --> 1890.1100000000001
they're called when they were still

1884.83 --> 1892.6599999999999
really kind of are at least seemingly

1890.11 --> 1898.6599999999999
genuine and was when the live roles

1892.66 --> 1903.669
didn't go insane yeah it happened in the

1898.66 --> 1905.5
last 20 years but yeah that party's no I

1903.669 --> 1908.94
wouldn't vote for them at this point I

1905.5 --> 1908.94
don't trust them at all

1926.46 --> 1936.49
at Tom Parker already said told that

1930.9 --> 1940.0590000000002
everyone its Adam ikan he did that

1936.49 --> 1943.8700000000001
animation no really the ego plane occur

1940.059 --> 1951.97
you're an anarchist did you hear my

1943.87 --> 1954.4899999999998
conversation yesterday I had I don't

1951.97 --> 1957.16
want to bust in your door or anything

1954.49 --> 1958.45
although I know you're well prepared for

1957.16 --> 1961.809
that especially if you're an anarchist

1958.45 --> 1967.71
but yeah there are serious problem with

1961.809 --> 1967.71
anarchy natural consequences and all

1970.68 --> 1976.6200000000001
and I try to point out that overall the

1974.37 --> 1980.85
government the structure itself it's not

1976.62 --> 1983.6999999999998
a problem it's the people being allowed

1980.85 --> 1984.4099999999999
to abuse it and to change things for the

1983.7 --> 1989.04
worse

1984.41 --> 1991.41
but if that structure if that system is

1989.04 --> 1993.72
taken away there will still be these

1991.41 --> 1996.78
people and they will find other grounds

1993.72 --> 2000.89
to do that they will always get back in

1996.78 --> 2003.83
your face no matter what so in my

2000.89 --> 2010.94
personal opinion to just take down the

2003.83 --> 2018.83
entire government is just senseless just

2010.94 --> 2022.54
undo the damage and prevent corruption

2018.83 --> 2022.54
because that is always the problem

2028.99 --> 2032.52
and it's gonna be complicated

2034.43 --> 2044.5
yes Tom Parker has a YouTube channel and

2041.0 --> 2044.5
he can be found on skype

2050.239 --> 2053.429
[Applause]

2056.05 --> 2060.6600000000003
my keyboard needs some vacation

2105.92 --> 2112.289
yeah I hope to get Karen beyond I don't

2108.69 --> 2115.369
know if she's still there or if she went

2112.289 --> 2115.369
away to do something else

2116.599 --> 2120.4990000000003
we still got half an hour

2152.44 --> 2163.299
why do you guys keep on insisting taking

2155.44 --> 2166.89
my face for your icons like seriously

2163.299 --> 2166.89
what is so special about this

2186.86 --> 2191.819
[Music]

2197.989 --> 2203.66
crabby why crab you what

2208.62 --> 2215.97
now what the thing is Mountain Dew and

2211.32 --> 2223.05
now I'm not agitated know what why no

2215.97 --> 2226.7599999999998
it's just if seriously that is meant as

2223.05 --> 2234.8700000000003
a compliment in a direct sense like if

2226.76 --> 2238.0800000000004
yeah you could look getting troll as a

2234.87 --> 2241.23
compliment but it's not very comfortable

2238.08 --> 2250.17
to just see your face being used by

2241.23 --> 2257.4
other people if you know what I mean no

2250.17 --> 2259.58
CGI Randi I had one earlier not on the

2257.4 --> 2259.58
show

2265.55 --> 2279.2200000000003
okay twenty shows ago what now a

2274.79 --> 2281.93
mountain dew it's all fine you insist

2279.22 --> 2284.0
I'm not complaining that the photo

2281.93 --> 2285.83
doesn't look good enough it's just kind

2284.0 --> 2288.65
of creeping me out to see my own

2285.83 --> 2291.11
photograph on other people's account

2288.65 --> 2292.21
constantly and it's been going on for a

2291.11 --> 2298.19
while

2292.21 --> 2305.15
indeed pumpkin it is [ __ ] weird take

2298.19 --> 2307.93
the bread okay yeah why not put your own

2305.15 --> 2307.9300000000003
face why not

2309.16 --> 2315.5
it's okay Mountain Dew it look the thing

2312.47 --> 2318.47
is it's not you it are well it is you

2315.5 --> 2322.19
but yeah the thing is there's like what

2318.47 --> 2327.7099999999996
is it ten other sock accounts that also

2322.19 --> 2334.2200000000003
do that although they all have some kind

2327.71 --> 2335.7200000000003
of arwen in the name so I guess you're

2334.22 --> 2339.73
not one of those kind of you're just

2335.72 --> 2342.5299999999997
genuinely taking my face on this as your

2339.73 --> 2348.05
account logo I guess so it's kind of

2342.53 --> 2352.01
different I guess you have good hair

2348.05 --> 2356.42
well thank thank you I'm very happy that

2352.01 --> 2359.11
I still have fair it's not perfect but

2356.42 --> 2359.11
it's good enough

2369.71 --> 2377.48
yeah man Harry I know they're yeah most

2375.26 --> 2380.96
are wind socks got banned here but

2377.48 --> 2385.359
that's because of that they then go spam

2380.96 --> 2385.359
for my chatons just freaking me out

2390.369 --> 2397.059
they're not exactly there for a good

2393.109 --> 2397.0589999999997
conversation if you know what I mean -

2397.66 --> 2404.54
Mountain Dew can sure you can do that

2401.95 --> 2407.2999999999997
now but anyway look

2404.54 --> 2411.47
Mountain Dew since use pretty much said

2407.3 --> 2415.2200000000003
okay I'm not one of those trolls it's

2411.47 --> 2416.75
fine if that's what you want then I

2415.22 --> 2420.91
don't really mind because you're not

2416.75 --> 2420.91
trying to troll me so that's fine

2421.0 --> 2426.92
just saying there's been some other

2424.089 --> 2430.96
involvement with accounts using those

2426.92 --> 2430.96
types of pictures and that's all

2451.97 --> 2454.87
really

2467.0 --> 2472.04
is that so I have no idea the special

2469.73 --> 2477.28
relativity say there is no curvature I

2472.04 --> 2477.2799999999997
don't think that is really the case

2481.03 --> 2485.84
although I think that when it comes to

2483.65 --> 2496.48
special relativity this is already so

2485.84 --> 2499.96
far mechanics and all that right now

2496.48 --> 2499.96
it's not my thing

2503.299 --> 2508.279
I used to find all that that type of

2506.229 --> 2510.439
conceptualizations and even Einstein's

2508.279 --> 2513.319
ideas very fascinating when I was

2510.439 --> 2515.479
younger but to me it just most of it

2513.319 --> 2517.13
really seems just like a big waste of

2515.479 --> 2519.819
time

2517.13 --> 2523.1890000000003
[Music]

2519.819 --> 2527.39
yes Mountain Dew I did cover it I did

2523.189 --> 2529.1299999999997
play the video Riley uploaded on my show

2527.39 --> 2533.1189999999997
if you missed it then either go watch

2529.13 --> 2535.4190000000003
Riley's video or after the show play it

2533.119 --> 2535.4190000000003
back

2548.48 --> 2558.619
right oh you're talking about the well

2554.38 --> 2563.839
look when Einstein really was

2558.619 --> 2567.65
conceptualizing what gravity was like he

2563.839 --> 2570.47
was merely trying to yeah

2567.65 --> 2575.349
mechanically figure out what it could be

2570.47 --> 2580.9399999999996
what could simulate a situation that

2575.349 --> 2584.3590000000004
could result mechanically into the

2580.94 --> 2588.14
gradient as we know it as well and that

2584.359 --> 2590.45
would be if special relativity does the

2588.14 --> 2592.52
if-if-if presupposition so it's not

2590.45 --> 2595.339
valid really but it's just like a

2592.52 --> 2598.7
simulation what would work just like

2595.339 --> 2601.609
this conceptually and that is moving up

2598.7 --> 2603.3199999999997
at a constant acceleration so that means

2601.609 --> 2609.23
speeding up forever

2603.32 --> 2615.8900000000003
okay that's that breaks all kinds of

2609.23 --> 2620.9
logic in the first place I think that is

2615.89 --> 2623.92
what that is and he never had to that

2620.9 --> 2626.39
it's just a conceptualization it's I

2623.92 --> 2630.339
delved into that even in my earlier

2626.39 --> 2634.9
gravity defensive days like yeah is an

2630.339 --> 2639.2
upward acceleration effect it's it a

2634.9 --> 2641.42
situation where that scenario would take

2639.2 --> 2643.3999999999996
place would probably resolve into

2641.42 --> 2646.069
something very similar as to what we

2643.4 --> 2646.9700000000003
experienced again that's the

2646.069 --> 2651.8
presupposition

2646.97 --> 2653.77
by its own nature so it doesn't really

2651.8 --> 2656.77
prove anything it's just a mechanical

2653.77 --> 2656.77
comparison

2673.52 --> 2675.55
Oh

2692.44 --> 2695.1
was

2704.63 --> 2710.2400000000002
oh really you're gonna try to yeah but

2707.47 --> 2715.1899999999996
you do understand that everything I just

2710.24 --> 2717.3799999999997
said that because of that it's not

2715.19 --> 2719.81
really gonna hold any weight it's just

2717.38 --> 2722.3900000000003
like oh yeah if you would have this

2719.81 --> 2724.37
scenario it would result in to fare

2722.39 --> 2725.8599999999997
something very similar as to what we

2724.37 --> 2729.68
experienced but that's pure

2725.86 --> 2731.96
presuppositional it's speculation you

2729.68 --> 2738.3799999999997
can't that doesn't prove anything

2731.96 --> 2750.98
that's the issue it never did it doesn't

2738.38 --> 2753.52
prove gravity either right father for

2750.98 --> 2753.52
stolen child

2779.55 --> 2791.57
oh and propel petting and trying to lay

2784.47 --> 2794.93
some weight on things are you the

2791.57 --> 2797.31
negativity negativity and the FE

2794.93 --> 2800.19
implying that we're the ones being

2797.31 --> 2803.66
negative well look if there's gonna be

2800.19 --> 2806.01
any violence right it's gonna be

2803.66 --> 2809.04
presented in two ways very much

2806.01 --> 2812.8500000000004
comparable to classic school social

2809.04 --> 2818.67
scenario setups concerning bullies right

2812.85 --> 2822.29
so that's two things either ballers are

2818.67 --> 2825.48
just gonna keep on pushing and literally

2822.29 --> 2828.24
trying to mentally torture people and

2825.48 --> 2833.73
stalk them effectively until they snap

2828.24 --> 2836.3399999999997
and then in some yeah panic move

2833.73 --> 2837.9900000000002
probably hurt a ball or pretty badly and

2836.34 --> 2840.3
they would have it coming in with a

2837.99 --> 2842.37
giant history of stalking and [ __ ] and

2840.3 --> 2843.6600000000003
whatever yeah it's gonna be messy if

2842.37 --> 2846.48
that happens I don't think it will

2843.66 --> 2848.94
though what is much more likely however

2846.48 --> 2851.16
is that we will definitely hold our

2848.94 --> 2852.63
ground since we flat earthers keep on

2851.16 --> 2855.72
growing and despite the opposition

2852.63 --> 2859.02
getting more and more nasty we have more

2855.72 --> 2861.99
energy more things to work with more

2859.02 --> 2868.23
trust in our path and in our future and

2861.99 --> 2870.6899999999996
in a good end result and yeah as we do

2868.23 --> 2872.4900000000002
that as we're not really budging it's

2870.69 --> 2876.42
gonna be the baller some of them that

2872.49 --> 2880.02
are just gonna go into a downward

2876.42 --> 2881.7000000000003
falling spiral all of a sudden because

2880.02 --> 2886.17
they didn't walk away when they should

2881.7 --> 2889.41
have a long time ago and then yeah that

2886.17 --> 2893.2400000000002
could result in some really tragic ends

2889.41 --> 2898.17
for themselves or they might try to

2893.24 --> 2902.72
avenge avenge their religion on some

2898.17 --> 2906.7200000000003
yeah on some flat earther but that

2902.72 --> 2910.62
that's gonna be pretty devastating blow

2906.72 --> 2913.359
for the ballers because that's certainly

2910.62 --> 2915.459
gonna yeah it's gonna beat Kobe

2913.359 --> 2920.2889999999998
sniveling liars then suddenly it's going

2915.459 --> 2922.509
to be true Minaya cala tea and people

2920.289 --> 2924.3390000000004
will be watching out for ballers after

2922.509 --> 2928.029
if the if such a thing would happen at

2924.339 --> 2935.739
some point so let's not let's hope it

2928.029 --> 2941.349
doesn't go there but yeah how long will

2935.739 --> 2944.099
it take no that's [ __ ] Chris berry

2941.349 --> 2947.829
ballers are not violent by Nature

2944.099 --> 2949.779
they're all humans and humans put into

2947.829 --> 2953.0190000000002
certain positions with certain

2949.779 --> 2955.42
imbalances and restrictions that will

2953.019 --> 2958.569
cause violence and that violence will

2955.42 --> 2961.4790000000003
express itself lightly and then a little

2958.569 --> 2964.119
more through probably social behaviors

2961.479 --> 2965.68
at first and then eventually when the

2964.119 --> 2970.4100000000003
pressure goes out of control that's when

2965.68 --> 2973.719
the real violence erupts and all humans

2970.41 --> 2976.719
work the same at it so it's it's all a

2973.719 --> 2979.029
matter of where are you where can you go

2976.719 --> 2984.359
can you resist the stress

2979.029 --> 2984.359
can you hold together and to what end

2992.48 --> 2998.13
well the studio look a bit of over

2995.91 --> 3000.5299999999997
general lazy and that's not so am I

2998.13 --> 3005.51
kidding radical leftist are violent yeah

3000.53 --> 3010.0400000000004
well if you're that deep into the Foxes

3005.51 --> 3012.1090000000004
own into total abyss nonsense that

3010.04 --> 3016.94
deeply and if doubled down on it's so

3012.109 --> 3020.7799999999997
bad in the face of everyone put yourself

3016.94 --> 3023.089
all out into that [ __ ] yeah you're

3020.78 --> 3025.94
you're literally put yourself in it in a

3023.089 --> 3026.72
clamp in a trap and you're getting

3025.94 --> 3028.88
squeezed

3026.72 --> 3033.49
so you're there's nowhere left to go but

3028.88 --> 3033.4900000000002
down yeah you're gonna go nuts

3039.75 --> 3046.83
but again that's what happens to humans

3042.42 --> 3054.119
or people that were once humans could

3046.83 --> 3057.56
say they're still humans but all depends

3054.119 --> 3063.4500000000003
on where you are what it is you're doing

3057.56 --> 3065.7
what is left for you and how well you

3063.45 --> 3069.0
can distinguish with what is real and

3065.7 --> 3072.75
what is not that one is probably the

3069.0 --> 3075.54
most important and not just talking

3072.75 --> 3077.73
about the knowledge of what the earth is

3075.54 --> 3088.65
and all that no it's much broader than

3077.73 --> 3094.71
that radical right is that's not even a

3088.65 --> 3102.619
word can you point me at some radical

3094.71 --> 3102.619
rightists a man like me a man like me

3106.76 --> 3111.59
because can be really funny you know if

3109.76 --> 3116.21
you're gonna say radical rightist at

3111.59 --> 3118.88
this point just name somebody and then

3116.21 --> 3120.619
let's do it not let I'm not gonna but

3118.88 --> 3123.859
just gonna tell you to because I already

3120.619 --> 3124.79
know where it's gonna lead right just do

3123.859 --> 3127.79
a background check

3124.79 --> 3130.49
look who they are what family what are

3127.79 --> 3131.83
they buying into what deals do they have

3130.49 --> 3135.6189999999997
yeah

3131.83 --> 3140.59
so what radical rightists are you

3135.619 --> 3140.59
referring to a man like me

3150.88 --> 3155.7400000000002
awfully silent all of a sudden oh I

3155.95 --> 3160.0299999999997
think Kerry is not gonna come

3172.66 --> 3175.3799999999997
hmm

3176.71 --> 3181.27
yeah and Warren Evans I am pretty sure

3179.2 --> 3188.5789999999997
that the heliocentric system is a

3181.27 --> 3191.98
religion and how it is a religion is its

3188.579 --> 3195.1800000000003
presuppositional make-belief and things

3191.98 --> 3199.51
that can be disproven will be discarded

3195.18 --> 3202.359
the disproof the falsifications will be

3199.51 --> 3206.25
discarded will be worked around and

3202.359 --> 3206.25
those are all signs of a religion

3207.03 --> 3216.5690000000004
religion prevents the people within it

3211.089 --> 3223.96
from finding the truth it only makes it

3216.569 --> 3234.91
go find the truth that it is about then

3223.96 --> 3239.05
it will fend off deviations from it no

3234.91 --> 3241.96
no we're in Athens you're that's really

3239.05 --> 3244.8390000000004
pathetic by that thinking F is not a

3241.96 --> 3247.2400000000002
religion because everybody has their own

3244.839 --> 3251.619
ideas and own opinions nobody's forcing

3247.24 --> 3255.339
anyone to accept details there's no

3251.619 --> 3258.01
consequences there is no signs of

3255.339 --> 3264.0299999999997
religious behavior we are all free

3258.01 --> 3267.9100000000003
people figuring it out and finding

3264.03 --> 3271.7200000000003
companionship in the search with one

3267.91 --> 3274.27
another and as we learn more we find

3271.72 --> 3277.93
newcomers that are also willing to learn

3274.27 --> 3282.49
and then we pass on what we have learned

3277.93 --> 3287.5299999999997
bit by bit as as we think would do well

3282.49 --> 3288.4599999999996
like as we think would be wise so we're

3287.53 --> 3292.71
not a religion

3288.46 --> 3295.869
we're on on a search all of us and

3292.71 --> 3298.18
because of the truth because of what the

3295.869 --> 3300.339
truth reveals we are just naturally

3298.18 --> 3302.44
going in the same direction but even as

3300.339 --> 3304.5099999999998
we go in the same direction still there

3302.44 --> 3308.5
are fundamental differences in idea

3304.51 --> 3310.51
differences vastly some people free

3308.5 --> 3312.97
allow themselves and

3310.51 --> 3316.869
themselves into presuppositions very

3312.97 --> 3320.9199999999996
deeply some are completely devoid of it

3316.869 --> 3323.4700000000003
and almost to analyst perspective but

3320.92 --> 3326.76
still it is still kind of the same

3323.47 --> 3347.22
direction with different decisions and

3326.76 --> 3347.2200000000003
that is not what religions do by

3349.05 --> 3352.8390000000004
[Music]

3355.62 --> 3364.48
[Applause]

3357.74 --> 3364.4799999999996
[Music]

3368.83 --> 3377.72
now Larry now every time you get thrown

3373.1 --> 3380.77
out right in the flat earth debates it's

3377.72 --> 3384.6499999999996
not because you're not agreeing with the

3380.77 --> 3386.75
dogma right we don't really have any

3384.65 --> 3389.9900000000002
it's just that you're not listening

3386.75 --> 3391.52
you're not continuing the conversation

3389.99 --> 3396.9199999999996
you're not responding to what's being

3391.52 --> 3400.49
said your red herring the situation your

3396.92 --> 3404.78
straw Manning it you're doing whatever

3400.49 --> 3408.68
and those are all just conversational

3404.78 --> 3411.02
and social offenses to do that that is

3408.68 --> 3413.0899999999997
why you get kicked not because you're

3411.02 --> 3416.09
not good with the dogma it's because

3413.09 --> 3420.38
you're being disruptive non-responsive

3416.09 --> 3423.9500000000003
and evasive persistently show shamefully

3420.38 --> 3429.26
so or not shameful shamelessly I would

3423.95 --> 3433.25
say rather and unrepentant sometimes you

3429.26 --> 3435.98
say yeah yeah yeah I know it is not

3433.25 --> 3438.26
really that great sometimes I do go a

3435.98 --> 3442.06
little bit far you seal some of you

3438.26 --> 3445.76
still show some kind of personality

3442.06 --> 3447.92
underneath all that but nothing really

3445.76 --> 3450.2000000000003
stops you in the end from going there

3447.92 --> 3454.3
all the way all over again

3450.2 --> 3459.9199999999996
doing it all to the deepest level

3454.3 --> 3462.4300000000003
psychological warfare that's what you do

3459.92 --> 3462.4300000000003
every time

3466.06 --> 3471.7599999999998
yeah so you definitely don't get kicked

3468.97 --> 3476.98
out of the Bates for not going with the

3471.76 --> 3480.0400000000004
dogma okay you're getting kicked out

3476.98 --> 3482.44
because you're not responding you're not

3480.04 --> 3486.7
continuing the conversation you're

3482.44 --> 3491.14
disrupting it you're whining about

3486.7 --> 3496.87
things constantly unnecessarily so you

3491.14 --> 3499.8399999999997
miss time just come the conversational

3496.87 --> 3502.6
elements you the timing is terrible on

3499.84 --> 3506.6800000000003
purpose to disrupt and you do it

3502.6 --> 3512.35
persistently systematically there is no

3506.68 --> 3514.4199999999996
reason to do - there is no logical

3512.35 --> 3517.99
reason that could be happening by

3514.42 --> 3520.78
accident continually that's not a

3517.99 --> 3524.5299999999997
possibility you do it systematically as

3520.78 --> 3528.3700000000003
a psychological warfare tactic to

3524.53 --> 3530.4100000000003
disrupt at all costs it's almost

3528.37 --> 3534.52
literally like you're literally just

3530.41 --> 3536.68
trying to shoot psycho warfare bullets

3534.52 --> 3540.48
at us as we are just trying to have a

3536.68 --> 3544.69
normal conversation perfect red herring

3540.48 --> 3545.59
straw man complaining pants sowing

3544.69 --> 3550.66
confusion

3545.59 --> 3553.3
lying double-faced 90-84 doublethink in

3550.66 --> 3555.94
plain sight in the span of a minute all

3553.3 --> 3557.5
that [ __ ] continually and you all forget

3555.94 --> 3558.1
it the next day like nothing ever

3557.5 --> 3560.71
happened

3558.1 --> 3563.86
because it's alright because you're

3560.71 --> 3570.73
doing what your religion tells you to do

3563.86 --> 3573.96
and that is defend the globe vision at

3570.73 --> 3573.96
all costs

3576.39 --> 3581.8399999999997
[Music]
