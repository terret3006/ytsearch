137.84 --> 143.20000000000002
clouds forming before like an hour ago

140.48 --> 146.0
there were no clouds whatsoever it was

143.2 --> 147.92
pure blue everything

146.0 --> 150.4
there's

147.92 --> 152.319
just a couple of planes flying over

150.4 --> 155.12
there leaving no trails

152.319 --> 159.599
only contrails

155.12 --> 159.59900000000002

159.68 --> 164.0

160.959 --> 164.0
bright sunny day

really do you say it like robles

248.0 --> 251.0
okay

256.639 --> 259.759
that's odd

260.799 --> 264.63899999999995
or maybe it's in another

263.68 --> 268.52
is it

264.639 --> 268.52
like an english name

275.6 --> 278.40000000000003

278.4 --> 285.52
i mean that sounds almost kind of

280.84 --> 285.52
dutch or french mexican

285.919 --> 289.35999999999996

313.759 --> 318.47900000000004
hello seeking star waters

316.96 --> 320.96
let's start water

318.479 --> 323.96
just one

320.96 --> 323.96
ah

334.72 --> 338.44000000000005
hey brian leaky

351.44 --> 356.71999999999997
right so yeah

354.4 --> 356.71999999999997
uh

359.6 --> 363.199
i've just been so

361.199 --> 366.08000000000004
enchanted by this weather this morning

363.199 --> 368.88
and i'm kind of like

366.08 --> 372.0
still i'm still absorbing the sun even

368.88 --> 373.44
though i'm not directly sitting in it

372.0 --> 376.84
i'm just

373.44 --> 376.84
very chill

394.0 --> 397.68
yeah lots of

395.28 --> 399.919
video also some video snippets here and

397.68 --> 399.919
there

401.28 --> 406.44
but yeah i i missed a lot of it again

409.44 --> 412.319
i got really

411.039 --> 413.36
stuck

412.319 --> 416.319
like

413.36 --> 419.759
yesterday on infowars alex decided to

416.319 --> 422.96000000000004
show some like really freaky stuff

419.759 --> 426.72
still not entirely sure what exactly i

422.96 --> 430.4
was looking at but basically started

426.72 --> 430.40000000000003
shopping footage from

430.639 --> 436.12
what's well what seemed like at least

432.639 --> 436.12
animal hybrids

436.16 --> 440.96000000000004
and

437.12 --> 445.12
maybe simeon crossbreed or human god for

440.96 --> 445.12
it but yeah that was freaky

446.4 --> 450.31899999999996
so that kind of stood out it's the first

448.319 --> 451.12
time i've ever seen sort of footage of

450.319 --> 455.199
it

451.12 --> 455.199
actual rolling footage and it's

456.319 --> 459.639
that was creepy

464.479 --> 467.919
yeah that was the first time i actually

466.0 --> 470.879
saw anything like that

467.919 --> 472.479
in live footage anyway

470.879 --> 474.72
uh

472.479 --> 478.24
yeah i've been invited by

474.72 --> 481.59900000000005
mitchell from australia

478.24 --> 484.08
to do a uh an interview show

481.599 --> 487.44
and i'm really honored

484.08 --> 487.44
somebody finally asked me

488.319 --> 492.319
that's pretty cool

490.24 --> 493.919
so yeah i think i'll be doing a live

492.319 --> 495.44
show with him

493.919 --> 498.31899999999996
uh

495.44 --> 501.52
in about eight hours from now so for me

498.319 --> 501.52000000000004
it will be an evening show

501.599 --> 504.56
don't know what we're going to be

502.72 --> 507.12
talking about i think probably a lot of

504.56 --> 508.319
community talk anti-flat earthers the

507.12 --> 510.8
basics

508.319 --> 512.719
mitchell really likes them

510.8 --> 514.88
and he's very eloquent at presenting

512.719 --> 515.6800000000001
them

514.88 --> 520.039
so

515.68 --> 520.039
yeah looking forward to doing that

521.76 --> 525.36
shout out to mitchell from australia

523.68 --> 527.519
subscribe to him

525.36 --> 529.279
so he already has more subscribers to me

527.519 --> 533.72
but screw that

529.279 --> 533.72
he does actually deserve it

547.76 --> 552.16
brian lee no i have no idea

549.92 --> 555.519
there's some mctoon song

552.16 --> 555.519
what who made it

556.56 --> 560.3599999999999
was it mr cheswick

583.68 --> 588.12
i didn't see anything pop up

609.68 --> 614.3599999999999
did mctoon actually make it himself

618.8 --> 621.76
that would be weird

622.079 --> 625.1999999999999
then again the glowers are getting very

624.24 --> 628.16
weird

625.2 --> 630.399
these days and not surprising

628.16 --> 633.8
because they really don't have anywhere

630.399 --> 633.8
else to go

634.48 --> 637.6
they're so cornered now is just nothing

636.64 --> 641.04
left

637.6 --> 641.0400000000001
but to go insane

641.519 --> 645.839
and that's what they're kind of doing

643.839 --> 648.399
so it seems

645.839 --> 648.399
most of them

652.079 --> 656.8
but yeah flat earth debates yesterday

653.76 --> 656.8
was very good

659.6 --> 665.9200000000001
there's a kumu virus again got on the

661.839 --> 665.9200000000001
after show and it lasted pretty long

672.56 --> 676.64
yeah completely forgot we were talking

674.56 --> 679.1199999999999
about in the first part

676.64 --> 680.16
because i did get involved

679.12 --> 682.72
uh

680.16 --> 684.959
but yeah we'll see that back on saturday

682.72 --> 684.9590000000001
so

686.079 --> 690.16
a lot of the times afterward i don't

688.32 --> 692.6400000000001
really remember what happened unless

690.16 --> 693.8389999999999
there was something very memorable for

692.64 --> 696.72
me

693.839 --> 700.0790000000001
meme wise or

696.72 --> 700.0790000000001
something new i figured out

700.88 --> 708.48
it's mctoon's last video oh

704.24 --> 708.48
well i'm not subscribed to mctoon so

710.639 --> 716.24
i'm i'm not subscribed to any anti-flat

713.44 --> 718.639
earther

716.24 --> 720.639
i'm trusting that if it's really

718.639 --> 722.8
noteworthy i'll be

720.639 --> 724.639
forwarded a link

722.8 --> 727.1999999999999
at some point

724.639 --> 731.2
and it works just fine and i don't mind

727.2 --> 733.6800000000001
like finding out things very late

731.2 --> 737.2
if it's from them it's like oh that's

733.68 --> 741.4799999999999
it's not really important anyway

737.2 --> 741.48
for the long run so

748.24 --> 753.04
jose played it

750.8 --> 753.04
huh

753.6 --> 758.16
all right yeah i hey i don't really

756.24 --> 760.5600000000001
follow jose

758.16 --> 762.399
despite me coming on his channel i only

760.56 --> 765.279
really go there when i feel like it and

762.399 --> 765.279
that's kind of rare

769.12 --> 776.72
but yeah sometimes he does pop up not in

773.68 --> 779.4399999999999
not in the notification list but in like

776.72 --> 782.8000000000001
recommended youtube videos

779.44 --> 785.0400000000001
sometimes i see him in live

782.8 --> 787.12
because apparently youtube likes my

785.04 --> 789.92
association with him

787.12 --> 789.92
why would that be

790.399 --> 795.12
but yeah i'm not i'm not subscribed or

792.959 --> 799.3199999999999
well notified so i don't really keep

795.12 --> 799.32
track of what jose does but

806.079 --> 812.399
so he made a

808.24 --> 815.839
a summary of nathan oakley teabagging

812.399 --> 815.839
baller clip

815.92 --> 819.12
i think he's he probably thinks it's

817.839 --> 823.44
really funny

819.12 --> 823.44
or crazy or bad behavior

823.6 --> 829.5600000000001
and so they do that

826.0 --> 829.56
they don't understand

830.8 --> 833.8389999999999
and they don't want to

837.44 --> 840.44
right

844.8 --> 847.04
uh

849.199 --> 854.4799999999999
yeah i'm a bit surprised about the lack

851.36 --> 856.399
of owen benjamin streams

854.48 --> 858.0790000000001
he had one wednesday and he had one

856.399 --> 860.639
monday

858.079 --> 862.4799999999999
and he he has done kind of gone around

860.639 --> 865.04
and done a couple of interviews with

862.48 --> 865.04
people but

865.76 --> 871.8
to me it's not even halfway as

867.44 --> 871.8000000000001
interesting as his actual streams

876.16 --> 880.24
oh yeah watched

877.76 --> 883.12
for the first time

880.24 --> 885.76
part of covet land

883.12 --> 888.88
which they kind of premiered for free on

885.76 --> 888.88
the infowars now

889.839 --> 895.519
but yeah it is

891.68 --> 895.519
it is kind of a summary movie

896.639 --> 903.519
with yeah lots of interviews and i guess

900.48 --> 903.519
it's a good summary

903.6 --> 908.5600000000001
it does contain a lot of data

906.079 --> 910.6389999999999
but it is mostly things that we've

908.56 --> 913.8389999999999
already known so in a way this is kind

910.639 --> 913.839
of like a

915.199 --> 921.199
like a loose change movie except for c

918.24 --> 923.279
and v situation

921.199 --> 925.3599999999999
because that was that as well if you

923.279 --> 927.279
remember right just a lot of interviews

925.36 --> 928.88
of people that were there that had some

927.279 --> 930.079
insight

928.88 --> 932.399
some witness

930.079 --> 935.04
things

932.399 --> 937.839
well this is kind of like that too

935.04 --> 938.8389999999999
i think on the long run it will be

937.839 --> 942.72
a

938.839 --> 945.1990000000001
good fallback thing

942.72 --> 946.32
to remind of what was actually going on

945.199 --> 949.5999999999999
here

946.32 --> 952.72
right so but yeah overall it is just

949.6 --> 954.5600000000001
basically all the sea situation and i

952.72 --> 958.48
kind of like yeah yeah i know it by now

954.56 --> 958.4799999999999
so i got kind of sick of it really

963.279 --> 968.48
and there's a lot of appeals to emotions

965.44 --> 969.519
as well but reasonable reasonable

968.48 --> 971.9200000000001
it's not

969.519 --> 974.16
super out of context manipulated or

971.92 --> 977.199
political or anything

974.16 --> 977.199
so anyway

978.56 --> 982.88
if you go to infowars you can find that

980.8 --> 985.519
if you're interested in

982.88 --> 987.8389999999999
yeah in a way i

985.519 --> 991.6
think a lot of people that visit my chat

987.839 --> 993.36
here are probably not that interested

991.6 --> 994.8000000000001
sometimes i wonder if i'm all that

993.36 --> 998.0790000000001
interested

994.8 --> 998.079
but i just keep track

999.12 --> 1001.6
that's it

1001.759 --> 1007.759
oh and doing more construction ah that

1004.079 --> 1007.7589999999999
would make sense slow mo moon buggy

1008.24 --> 1011.48
all right

1021.839 --> 1024.839
right

1025.199 --> 1029.3600000000001
it's not like i'm since no i'm not

1027.12 --> 1032.799
surviving without owen benjamin streams

1029.36 --> 1034.1599999999999
every day you know if i really long for

1032.799 --> 1035.76
just hearing me in the background i'll

1034.16 --> 1038.64
just play in

1035.76 --> 1041.039
the previous episode it's not like it's

1038.64 --> 1043.76
oh my god please don't make me hear that

1041.039 --> 1045.839
again no no it's it's pretty good

1043.76 --> 1048.559
i've been

1045.839 --> 1050.96
very pleased

1048.559 --> 1053.9189999999999
with what he's been doing in recent

1050.96 --> 1057.44
times he's been reminding me about very

1053.919 --> 1060.5590000000002
important details on a higher

1057.44 --> 1063.919
spiritual level brought very pure

1060.559 --> 1063.9189999999999
and that's useful

1065.2 --> 1070.16
and he's done it just very well

1068.16 --> 1073.2
like i can spot

1070.16 --> 1075.76
in reflection to him very easily

1073.2 --> 1077.039
what i'm doing wrong

1075.76 --> 1080.32
and feel

1077.039 --> 1082.799
feel that get real about it and that's

1080.32 --> 1082.799
important

1086.88 --> 1090.72
because i still do have flaws i still

1088.96 --> 1093.52
have my weird

1090.72 --> 1097.28
rage to deal with even though i'm not

1093.52 --> 1101.039
i'm not so casually

1097.28 --> 1101.039
doing that on my show anymore

1101.12 --> 1104.32
it's still in the background sometimes i

1103.28 --> 1108.08
just

1104.32 --> 1110.799
i get this i look around then i see some

1108.08 --> 1114.799
terrible news thing

1110.799 --> 1115.76
and i i get just this very quick

1114.799 --> 1117.44
heavy

1115.76 --> 1120.799
anger

1117.44 --> 1124.96
response but yeah always like i just

1120.799 --> 1124.96
immediately call for extreme justice

1125.2 --> 1128.64
and afterward i kind of feel stupid

1127.36 --> 1130.559
about it

1128.64 --> 1132.72
because i could have just flicked away

1130.559 --> 1135.039
because thinking about it more carefully

1132.72 --> 1136.88
it's always like wait i don't exactly

1135.039 --> 1138.559
know the context of everything here it's

1136.88 --> 1140.0800000000002
just one article

1138.559 --> 1143.36
it may be a video

1140.08 --> 1146.08
report and a photograph i don't know i

1143.36 --> 1148.799
can't make that judgment

1146.08 --> 1151.799
i guess that's its purpose to show me

1148.799 --> 1151.799
that

1155.36 --> 1159.36
and owen is

1158.0 --> 1162.4
just

1159.36 --> 1164.32
he's got a good grip on on that

1162.4 --> 1167.2800000000002
influence on that effect on not

1164.32 --> 1170.1599999999999
responding and instead deviating

1167.28 --> 1172.0
attention to productive things

1170.16 --> 1174.48
and i think he's a really good example

1172.0 --> 1174.48
for that

1177.36 --> 1181.6789999999999
jim bob's stream yesterday was a good

1178.88 --> 1184.3200000000002
yeah yeah i did follow that one

1181.679 --> 1186.4
he did get cut off though very suddenly

1184.32 --> 1189.2
he gets cut off a lot

1186.4 --> 1189.2
very annoying

1190.559 --> 1196.48
like i think there's some well

1193.2 --> 1196.48
grabblers after him

1201.12 --> 1207.84
i think he's getting a lot of attention

1204.24 --> 1207.84
and they're trying to screw with him

1230.4 --> 1237.6000000000001
right yeah so subscribe to jim bob

1234.48 --> 1238.96
check him out he usually does a stream

1237.6 --> 1241.36
in the evening

1238.96 --> 1243.3600000000001
has this weird habit of doing it exactly

1241.36 --> 1247.12
at the same time that

1243.36 --> 1249.6789999999999
mitchell from australia is going live

1247.12 --> 1253.52
but

1249.679 --> 1253.52
it's definitely worth checking out

1253.919 --> 1257.88
let me link him up

1279.12 --> 1281.4399999999998
huh

1284.0 --> 1290.039
interesting singing star wars you got a

1286.4 --> 1290.039
hint very early

1292.08 --> 1295.84
actually wrote a song about yeah well i

1294.88 --> 1297.919
never

1295.84 --> 1299.9189999999999
did anything with it

1297.919 --> 1302.48
every time i realized that when i was

1299.919 --> 1306.159
young it just hurt me so much i just

1302.48 --> 1306.159
didn't want to be reminded about it

1309.52 --> 1316.6399999999999
i was never really like oh i'm going to

1312.72 --> 1316.64
make art to express this thing

1317.36 --> 1324.32
i was more interested in

1321.28 --> 1324.32
in robotics

1324.96 --> 1330.72
like i did make some art like i even won

1327.44 --> 1333.52
a prize at some point in the competition

1330.72 --> 1336.24
or it was basically playing a

1333.52 --> 1337.36
computer playing with a robot arm

1336.24 --> 1339.2
playing

1337.36 --> 1341.28
a computer game

1339.2 --> 1342.24
and having an emotional response to what

1341.28 --> 1345.28
happened

1342.24 --> 1348.32
and i won a prize for that woohoo like

1345.28 --> 1349.76
actually won money for that and it was

1348.32 --> 1352.08
like

1349.76 --> 1354.64
11 i think

1352.08 --> 1355.84
and everybody was like yes yes and i was

1354.64 --> 1358.0800000000002
like whoa

1355.84 --> 1360.0
i don't even understand

1358.08 --> 1361.039
half the reasons why you're applauding

1360.0 --> 1363.2
here

1361.039 --> 1366.24
but yeah i really like my drawing and i

1363.2 --> 1368.88
really like i liked robot arms

1366.24 --> 1368.88
i like the

1369.36 --> 1374.1589999999999
the computer and computer games it was

1372.159 --> 1375.919
also by the way a computer game a

1374.159 --> 1377.0390000000002
side-scrolling

1375.919 --> 1379.44
space

1377.039 --> 1382.72
flight

1379.44 --> 1386.0
like on with moon bases and

1382.72 --> 1387.44
the typical side flyer

1386.0 --> 1389.6
video game

1387.44 --> 1391.6000000000001
so that was also like i didn't even

1389.6 --> 1393.36
realize it back then

1391.6 --> 1395.76
like basically what i had drawn

1393.36 --> 1400.6
apparently hit on a very existential

1395.76 --> 1400.6
note without me even realizing it

1402.24 --> 1405.52
i still have the drawing somewhere i

1404.159 --> 1408.48
think

1405.52 --> 1408.48
i don't know where though

1411.52 --> 1414.559
right

1412.4 --> 1417.3600000000001
but i didn't realize that it was

1414.559 --> 1420.32
basically probably a symbol

1417.36 --> 1422.4799999999998
for very high elitists

1420.32 --> 1424.96
and that's what i thought about it

1422.48 --> 1426.72
afterward but now i'm talking like 20

1424.96 --> 1429.039
years afterward i started to realize

1426.72 --> 1431.44
that like whoa

1429.039 --> 1433.12
it meant more than i even knew i was

1431.44 --> 1435.52
just putting things together that i

1433.12 --> 1435.52
liked

1436.48 --> 1440.0
i was kind of like

1438.08 --> 1443.559
yeah of course computers can have

1440.0 --> 1443.559
feelings too

1444.96 --> 1447.3600000000001
right

1446.48 --> 1449.679
but

1447.36 --> 1452.7199999999998
yeah it did kind of stand for look the

1449.679 --> 1454.159
robot is going to sustain the space

1452.72 --> 1456.48
belief

1454.159 --> 1460.3200000000002
in on a computer screen

1456.48 --> 1460.32
i didn't even realize that

1460.64 --> 1466.7990000000002
like it is going to play that game

1464.0 --> 1468.88
it is going to figure out like it the

1466.799 --> 1470.72
artificial intelligence

1468.88 --> 1475.0390000000002
i guess i envisioned in a way that the

1470.72 --> 1475.039
artificial intelligence could become a

1475.36 --> 1480.08
creator

1477.12 --> 1481.1999999999998
and even like a human a participant in

1480.08 --> 1484.1589999999999
the

1481.2 --> 1484.159
globe religion

1484.72 --> 1488.32
that it would be a simulation of

1486.559 --> 1490.559
somebody that is in the globe religion

1488.32 --> 1493.36
kind of like i was myself like we're

1490.559 --> 1496.0
building it it has to be real so we are

1493.36 --> 1496.0
going to build it

1499.6 --> 1503.4399999999998
anyway it's all in the past

1505.279 --> 1510.4
i'd love to show that drawing but i

1508.4 --> 1513.679
don't have it at hand i don't have a

1510.4 --> 1515.679
copy on my computer i really should

1513.679 --> 1518.679
i mean it's literally a prize-winning

1515.679 --> 1518.679
drawing

1532.559 --> 1540.559
did i copyright the run from our song

1537.44 --> 1540.559
that's hilarious

1541.279 --> 1543.84
no

1544.0 --> 1550.4
like seriously it's the row your boat

1546.4 --> 1550.4
song you can't copyright that

1550.72 --> 1554.4
just by change changing the text you

1552.559 --> 1556.799
can't copyright that i mean i could make

1554.4 --> 1559.1200000000001
a studio recording

1556.799 --> 1561.44
and then copyright that studio recording

1559.12 --> 1562.3999999999999
but if people just choose to sing the r

1561.44 --> 1564.159
song

1562.4 --> 1567.039
the run from our song

1564.159 --> 1568.7990000000002
it's not going to

1567.039 --> 1573.039
do anything like

1568.799 --> 1576.24
it's not a literal copy of the recording

1573.039 --> 1577.52
right just like oh a song from let's say

1576.24 --> 1579.36
metallica

1577.52 --> 1580.8799999999999
well yeah if you use an original

1579.36 --> 1582.9599999999998
recording it's gonna get a copyright

1580.88 --> 1585.919
strike etc etc that's

1582.96 --> 1588.4
but if you literally play it with your

1585.919 --> 1591.3600000000001
band live

1588.4 --> 1591.3600000000001
then nothing happens

1594.96 --> 1601.679
if you record that

1598.0 --> 1604.08
unless you play it so so super

1601.679 --> 1606.72
detailed exactly like the original

1604.08 --> 1609.36
record that it sounds so exactly alike

1606.72 --> 1613.6000000000001
then maybe the i will like be like hey

1609.36 --> 1615.279
this is that literal recording

1613.6 --> 1617.4399999999998
right but yeah

1615.279 --> 1620.4
who's gonna play

1617.44 --> 1622.4
one of those old songs perfectly exactly

1620.4 --> 1625.039
alike in a recording that's like almost

1622.4 --> 1625.039
impossible

1625.6 --> 1629.6789999999999
anyway thank you that flat fellow for

1627.2 --> 1632.64
the 99 cents

1629.679 --> 1632.64
thank you for the nickel

1636.559 --> 1643.6499999999999
run from our song no but run from our

1639.36 --> 1646.789
song is anybody can use it if they want

1643.65 --> 1646.789
[Music]

1647.039 --> 1652.059
it's public domain

1648.89 --> 1652.0590000000002
[Music]

1666.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
um

1672.159 --> 1675.919
yeah nathan was very gracious

1674.64 --> 1677.679
towards me

1675.919 --> 1679.3600000000001
yesterday on the flat earth debate right

1677.679 --> 1681.279
when i came back because i came back

1679.36 --> 1682.9599999999998
late

1681.279 --> 1685.039
in the sense well that's actually kind

1682.96 --> 1688.32
of soon for me usually i don't arrive

1685.039 --> 1690.559
when the live recording is still going

1688.32 --> 1693.84
but yeah as usual i went for groceries

1690.559 --> 1695.52
did it very quickly though

1693.84 --> 1699.1999999999998
when i came back

1695.52 --> 1699.2
everybody was talking about me

1700.399 --> 1707.4399999999998
and then i had to explain the

1703.6 --> 1711.7199999999998
darwinian paradox concerning terrestrial

1707.44 --> 1711.72
refraction and the r value

1712.08 --> 1716.08
that was nice

1713.36 --> 1719.039
i really appreciate getting

1716.08 --> 1720.8799999999999
like support like that just shout outs

1719.039 --> 1725.48
and compliments

1720.88 --> 1725.48
for things that i have actually done

1729.679 --> 1733.3600000000001
it's good to feel useful

1733.44 --> 1736.44
anyway

1738.799 --> 1744.399
right and i'm not a guy

1741.2 --> 1746.96
like to be fair like most people

1744.399 --> 1748.399
that are constantly like yeah i'm going

1746.96 --> 1750.0
to

1748.399 --> 1752.32
have these things that i've done and

1750.0 --> 1755.039
then constantly shove them in your face

1752.32 --> 1757.52
to kind of like dominate i don't do that

1755.039 --> 1759.36
so a lot of the times i just kind of

1757.52 --> 1761.44
forget

1759.36 --> 1763.36
everything i've done until somebody

1761.44 --> 1765.6000000000001
reminds me about it and then like oh

1763.36 --> 1768.32
yeah oh right yeah i did actually do

1765.6 --> 1768.32
that huh

1768.88 --> 1773.679
right because i want to start with a

1771.44 --> 1774.559
clean slate like every moment pretty

1773.679 --> 1777.8400000000001
much

1774.559 --> 1781.12
because that way you get the original

1777.84 --> 1783.76
creative room at least somewhat well if

1781.12 --> 1786.08
you're just having these icons in your

1783.76 --> 1788.24
mind constantly of things you've done

1786.08 --> 1790.1589999999999
that are like dragging your weight

1788.24 --> 1792.64
around

1790.159 --> 1795.2
then everything you try to let spring up

1792.64 --> 1797.44
the creativeness is very likely to

1795.2 --> 1800.159
suddenly get rerouted

1797.44 --> 1802.24
reflecting off those icons

1800.159 --> 1803.0390000000002
so if you don't have those icons in your

1802.24 --> 1808.44
head

1803.039 --> 1808.44
then it can basically become anything

1808.88 --> 1813.3600000000001
so

1810.32 --> 1815.6
in a way it is a like a tactical spirit

1813.36 --> 1818.1589999999999
management thing

1815.6 --> 1820.399
the fir yeah it's it's not literally

1818.159 --> 1822.0
forgetfulness it's just that i don't

1820.399 --> 1826.32
constantly

1822.0 --> 1826.32
keep my memory in my foreground

1826.72 --> 1830.799
i just trust that i can't really forget

1829.76 --> 1832.96
things

1830.799 --> 1835.279
not really

1832.96 --> 1836.799
that if it's really important i will

1835.279 --> 1839.039
find the energy

1836.799 --> 1841.84
and focus and then i remember everything

1839.039 --> 1843.6
again whatever i need

1841.84 --> 1845.4399999999998
right

1843.6 --> 1847.9189999999999
anyway hey thank you america silver

1845.44 --> 1851.52
patriot 20 dollar super chat the nation

1847.919 --> 1854.48
you rocked it brother thank you

1851.52 --> 1856.559
i appreciate that by the way if you want

1854.48 --> 1859.2
to overall support me america's silver

1856.559 --> 1861.44
patriot i really appreciate it

1859.2 --> 1862.24
don't know if you know that

1861.44 --> 1864.64
but

1862.24 --> 1868.0
yeah super chats through

1864.64 --> 1871.1200000000001
uh through the youtube

1868.0 --> 1873.279
they're mostly billboards because i

1871.12 --> 1876.84
practically don't receive anything from

1873.279 --> 1879.84
it i mean it's good for my income

1876.84 --> 1881.84
stats right but

1879.84 --> 1883.84
i practically don't really get anything

1881.84 --> 1887.039
out of it if you actually want to

1883.84 --> 1889.36
support my financial situation i'd ask

1887.039 --> 1891.12
you to support me through paypal

1889.36 --> 1894.0
primarily

1891.12 --> 1895.12
or on the long run through patreon

1894.0 --> 1898.159
but yeah

1895.12 --> 1898.1589999999999
still appreciate it

1902.159 --> 1905.159
thanks

1906.88 --> 1910.159
right because stats are kind of good

1908.88 --> 1913.1200000000001
it's

1910.159 --> 1914.7990000000002
unfortunately i am in the netherlands

1913.12 --> 1917.279
and

1914.799 --> 1920.6399999999999
i've never really been a guy that's like

1917.279 --> 1923.12
grabbed onto a a standard income based

1920.64 --> 1923.1200000000001
career

1924.799 --> 1929.12
very eclectic very layman

1927.12 --> 1931.9189999999999
but just never

1929.12 --> 1934.32
rooting myself down in like a

1931.919 --> 1935.919
a typical income occupation other than

1934.32 --> 1938.0
this really this is

1935.919 --> 1939.8400000000001
you might be surprised this is

1938.0 --> 1942.559
all beside my goldsmithing but i didn't

1939.84 --> 1944.24
really get around from that

1942.559 --> 1946.48
this is like the first thing that's

1944.24 --> 1949.679
actually generating some income for me

1946.48 --> 1952.88
that i've been doing

1949.679 --> 1952.88
i'm very happy about it

1953.679 --> 1958.3990000000001
but

1955.44 --> 1958.3990000000001
what was i saying

1959.84 --> 1963.399
i lost track

1964.24 --> 1966.64
whatever

1970.64 --> 1975.279
if you really want to support me in my

1972.96 --> 1976.3990000000001
financial situation and i do need it to

1975.279 --> 1978.88
kind of

1976.399 --> 1982.1589999999999
keep doing this

1978.88 --> 1984.5590000000002
being able to keep focus especially

1982.159 --> 1986.88
then paypal is the way

1984.559 --> 1988.0
right now and they haven't really gotten

1986.88 --> 1990.64
in my way

1988.0 --> 1993.2
very grateful for that

1990.64 --> 1996.3990000000001
very aware that other people have been

1993.2 --> 1996.3990000000001
like politically

1996.88 --> 2001.679
attacked through them

1999.519 --> 2003.279
and i'm not happy about that i'm not

2001.679 --> 2005.519
really happy about

2003.279 --> 2007.519
some of the choices that were made at

2005.519 --> 2009.76
the top

2007.519 --> 2012.24
but yeah same goes for google

2009.76 --> 2012.24
of course

2012.88 --> 2017.3600000000001
it's still just

2014.799 --> 2019.84
as long as i can use it and i can remain

2017.36 --> 2021.519
honest and also

2019.84 --> 2023.519
not constantly pushing but still

2021.519 --> 2025.6
critical about

2023.519 --> 2027.36
the wrong doings

2025.6 --> 2029.84
then

2027.36 --> 2034.9599999999998
i can keep going

2029.84 --> 2034.9599999999998
i created freedom is important

2036.799 --> 2041.679
and i'm only willing to go like i will

2039.2 --> 2043.679
never retreat from subjects really

2041.679 --> 2045.6000000000001
unless i find them like really

2043.679 --> 2048.0
degenerate

2045.6 --> 2050.56
or demoralizing

2048.0 --> 2050.56
in a moment

2051.44 --> 2057.44
so i will never really censor myself but

2056.24 --> 2061.6789999999996
if

2057.44 --> 2064.159
some subjects are too current

2061.679 --> 2066.2400000000002
too much of a hot iron that you can't

2064.159 --> 2067.28
touch it that they just instantly take

2066.24 --> 2069.6789999999996
it out

2067.28 --> 2071.599
because it's too hot on a subject like

2069.679 --> 2075.359
then i will

2071.599 --> 2077.839
try to rip bypass that effect by saying

2075.359 --> 2079.52
for example c and v

2077.839 --> 2081.679
or i

2079.52 --> 2084.32
right but by doing that

2081.679 --> 2087.04
i also immediately imply to anybody

2084.32 --> 2088.8
that's following my show that these are

2087.04 --> 2090.8
the hot subjects

2088.8 --> 2093.44
and that you should know what i'm

2090.8 --> 2096.48
talking about when i say that

2093.44 --> 2098.88
the one letter words

2096.48 --> 2102.599
that's very important

2098.88 --> 2102.599
that you know them

2104.0 --> 2109.599
because it it remains worthy to keep

2106.72 --> 2109.5989999999997
bringing them up

2109.92 --> 2115.4
even though i i can't say the word as it

2112.4 --> 2115.4
is

2123.68 --> 2125.9199999999996
all right

2126.32 --> 2132.6400000000003
but yeah i will never just deviate away

2130.079 --> 2133.4
entirely like completely negate these

2132.64 --> 2136.5589999999997
subjects

2133.4 --> 2136.559
[Music]

2137.76 --> 2141.76
because i do keep track of what's really

2139.599 --> 2145.52
important in my opinion

2141.76 --> 2149.28
in my views in my research

2145.52 --> 2153.16
in my oracling anyway

2149.28 --> 2153.1600000000003
somebody say something

2164.56 --> 2168.7999999999997
it's been silent for 10 minutes in chat

2169.839 --> 2174.7999999999997
are you all zoning out

2171.76 --> 2174.8
for my little speech

2179.119 --> 2182.48
i gotta be careful with that

2184.4 --> 2189.52
i do have that tendency to kind of go in

2187.28 --> 2192.32
story mode and then the other one just

2189.52 --> 2195.28
goes into listen mode

2192.32 --> 2197.28
and it's happened a lot

2195.28 --> 2198.96
even like face-to-face situation where i

2197.28 --> 2201.0400000000004
go that and then eventually i'm just

2198.96 --> 2202.56
noticing like whoa they're they're

2201.04 --> 2204.24
locked

2202.56 --> 2206.0
like they don't know how to open up

2204.24 --> 2207.7599999999998
their mouths anymore because i've been

2206.0 --> 2209.52
talking and they've been listening so

2207.76 --> 2212.6400000000003
intensely that they get locked and then

2209.52 --> 2212.64
i'm like uh hi

2212.72 --> 2217.2
i'll stop talking now because i see it's

2215.76 --> 2220.079
yeah it's

2217.2 --> 2222.0
becoming too much

2220.079 --> 2224.48
so i wonder if that happens here too

2222.0 --> 2224.48
sometimes

2225.28 --> 2230.1600000000003
any ideas on a halloween i don't do that

2227.76 --> 2232.4
kind of gimmicky [ __ ] slow mo moon buggy

2230.16 --> 2234.8799999999997
i'm sorry i'm a real stick in the mud

2232.4 --> 2234.88
like that

2235.44 --> 2240.56
and anybody that's been following my

2237.2 --> 2242.24
show can attest to that i am a major

2240.56 --> 2244.7999999999997
stick in the mud when it comes to those

2242.24 --> 2244.7999999999997
kind of things

2249.359 --> 2257.72
i want to see horror turtle on the tv

2252.72 --> 2257.72
yeah it's really easy these days to find

2265.2 --> 2268.56
man i watched it really

2269.359 --> 2273.92
i watched the hollywood movie on netflix

2272.079 --> 2275.8390000000004
yesterday

2273.92 --> 2278.0
but it was kind of a weird experience

2275.839 --> 2280.48
funny but also

2278.0 --> 2281.92
like creepy a little

2280.48 --> 2284.88
night and day

2281.92 --> 2287.6800000000003
it's like a a really like a spy action

2284.88 --> 2290.96
movie but it was all so quick paced and

2287.68 --> 2290.96
it really was about

2291.28 --> 2296.32
being subjected to

2293.839 --> 2296.32
to that

2296.64 --> 2299.839
it was interesting

2300.079 --> 2305.599
it was very psychological

2302.48 --> 2307.44
and hey it had basically two of my

2305.599 --> 2310.0
yeah favorite

2307.44 --> 2311.119
actors i'd have to say i don't know what

2310.0 --> 2312.8
they're like

2311.119 --> 2314.88
well i do know a little bit about tom

2312.8 --> 2316.079
cruise but tom cruise is in there

2314.88 --> 2319.6800000000003
and

2316.079 --> 2323.48
and that lady i'm sorry late

2319.68 --> 2323.48
what's in it is

2326.32 --> 2332.48
i'm sorry i'm very bad at names

2329.2 --> 2334.16
but i do appreciate that actress

2332.48 --> 2336.32
i think she's just the one that also

2334.16 --> 2339.3199999999997
played and killed bill

2336.32 --> 2339.32
uh

2341.28 --> 2346.6400000000003
oh it's 2010 is already 10 years old huh

2348.24 --> 2353.839
cameron diaz yeah yeah ooh

2352.0 --> 2356.48
i think she's very interested like she

2353.839 --> 2360.24
has like

2356.48 --> 2360.2400000000002
very subtle social skills

2363.119 --> 2368.839
right but they made a very interesting

2365.839 --> 2368.839
duo

2370.16 --> 2374.24
so it's almost like a bit of a concept

2372.079 --> 2376.5600000000004
movie

2374.24 --> 2377.68
also it's so funny now

2376.56 --> 2380.32
i

2377.68 --> 2383.839
like tom cruise dude i really appreciate

2380.32 --> 2383.839
you you're very charismatic

2384.32 --> 2389.119
you're very good at taking that i can

2386.8 --> 2392.1600000000003
iconic position right that's why you

2389.119 --> 2392.88
were so effective in mission impossible

2392.16 --> 2394.7999999999997
and

2392.88 --> 2398.7200000000003
and all that

2394.8 --> 2401.28
but you are so small bro

2398.72 --> 2404.24
like rogan's size small

2401.28 --> 2407.3590000000004
and that's okay because

2404.24 --> 2407.359
i can now see it

2407.52 --> 2411.7599999999998
like they have to put him on a

2409.599 --> 2414.2400000000002
heightening cushion every time he sits

2411.76 --> 2416.8
on a seat right next to like

2414.24 --> 2419.1189999999997
another actor or something to make him

2416.8 --> 2421.3590000000004
seem the same height because he is so

2419.119 --> 2423.359
small and it happens everywhere and they

2421.359 --> 2425.52
always take this into account and it's

2423.359 --> 2427.2
really standing out to me it's just a

2425.52 --> 2429.52
funny little thing

2427.2 --> 2431.5989999999997
and it doesn't ruin the movie

2429.52 --> 2433.68
right if you just forget about it and

2431.599 --> 2436.4
just think that tom cruise is kind of

2433.68 --> 2437.2
like regular size the same as everybody

2436.4 --> 2441.119
else

2437.2 --> 2441.1189999999997
then yeah it's it's great

2441.52 --> 2447.119
when you pay really close attention you

2443.68 --> 2449.839
do start a notice like wait

2447.119 --> 2452.2400000000002
tom cruise is sitting on something

2449.839 --> 2454.72
that's a little higher

2452.24 --> 2457.839
it's just funny or is it standing on a

2454.72 --> 2457.839
little podium or something

2460.72 --> 2465.319
it's yeah

2462.0 --> 2465.319
i don't know

2468.88 --> 2476.04
cameron d is one of the worst actresses

2471.119 --> 2476.04
ever act really awake why

2493.2 --> 2499.4399999999996
i mean did she say something really

2495.2 --> 2499.4399999999996
stupid liberal or was she like

2499.599 --> 2504.48
yeah as i said i don't know like what

2501.76 --> 2507.0400000000004
they're like in their lives but i like

2504.48 --> 2509.839
in movies i do kind of appreciate them

2507.04 --> 2509.839
so

2511.76 --> 2515.599
she lacks the ability to act

2516.56 --> 2520.48
huh

2518.16 --> 2520.48
okay

2520.72 --> 2525.04
well maybe she's not

2522.88 --> 2527.599
yeah you might be right

2525.04 --> 2529.119
but she still has interesting traits

2527.599 --> 2529.92
though

2529.119 --> 2532.48
like

2529.92 --> 2535.359
she plays

2532.48 --> 2537.52
roles that i that do kind of i don't

2535.359 --> 2539.68
know maybe i'm just slightly attracted

2537.52 --> 2541.52
or something i don't know what it is

2539.68 --> 2544.52
come on she is kind of

2541.52 --> 2544.52
hot

2551.839 --> 2558.319
but yeah thinking about it probably

2555.839 --> 2559.68
people that are not charmed by her will

2558.319 --> 2563.96
find

2559.68 --> 2563.96
yeah you might be right awake

2564.48 --> 2569.319
she retired also all right

2592.24 --> 2597.1189999999997
wow that's so

2593.839 --> 2599.119
gamma of you to say it like that awake

2597.119 --> 2601.119
she got by by her looks and quirkiness

2599.119 --> 2602.319
and got found out

2601.119 --> 2604.4
oh

2602.319 --> 2606.72
you mean at some point it just wasn't

2604.4 --> 2609.119
enough anymore people expected more of

2606.72 --> 2610.3999999999996
her and then she didn't really have that

2609.119 --> 2613.44
yeah sure

2610.4 --> 2613.44
got found out

2616.079 --> 2621.6800000000003
well look her looks and quirkiness

2618.48 --> 2624.319
really work

2621.68 --> 2624.319
worked for me

2629.28 --> 2633.92
right but yeah she might not be like a

2631.76 --> 2635.6800000000003
super actress right not everybody is

2633.92 --> 2637.599
like that

2635.68 --> 2640.839
it's actually

2637.599 --> 2640.839
pretty rare

2652.0 --> 2657.48
hey dusty ryder yeah i'm great i'm doing

2654.48 --> 2657.48
great

2663.92 --> 2666.16
what

2667.599 --> 2674.96
i thought clear water was a navy town

2670.64 --> 2678.24
but it was all sea org scientologist

2674.96 --> 2678.2400000000002
okay that's weird

2680.24 --> 2684.839
i don't know what sea org is

2697.68 --> 2701.7599999999998
right she has good comedic timing i

2700.079 --> 2703.52
agree with that

2701.76 --> 2706.2400000000002
look the thing is

2703.52 --> 2708.48
whether she is a very dynamic actress or

2706.24 --> 2708.4799999999996
not

2708.64 --> 2713.1189999999997
like i haven't seen a movie with her in

2711.28 --> 2715.28
it where i wasn't like

2713.119 --> 2717.599
i like that

2715.28 --> 2718.4
like she did she was

2717.599 --> 2720.6400000000003
just

2718.4 --> 2722.7200000000003
like a little flower in every one of

2720.64 --> 2722.72
them

2728.4 --> 2733.839
so

2729.28 --> 2733.8390000000004
and yeah the comedic timing is great

2734.72 --> 2738.2799999999997
so yeah

2754.319 --> 2758.079
right and i thought in this movie

2756.16 --> 2760.48
particularly that

2758.079 --> 2764.5600000000004
day and night that counted because it's

2760.48 --> 2767.68
like a super super overkill action movie

2764.56 --> 2770.16
like super hero perfect action type of

2767.68 --> 2773.04
movie like that right

2770.16 --> 2775.7599999999998
and she acted like somebody that's more

2773.04 --> 2777.92
much more like a regular person like ah

2775.76 --> 2780.4
what the hell is all this

2777.92 --> 2780.4
like what

2780.56 --> 2784.56
what what did you just do that's insane

2783.119 --> 2785.839
ah

2784.56 --> 2789.4
and

2785.839 --> 2789.4
it kind of worked

2789.52 --> 2793.359
and then it ended up really silly and

2792.0 --> 2795.119
funny

2793.359 --> 2796.96
so i don't know i thought it was an

2795.119 --> 2799.2000000000003
interesting movie

2796.96 --> 2802.68
very rough though lots of people getting

2799.2 --> 2802.68
killed constantly

2805.599 --> 2809.3590000000004
like pretty quickly

2807.28 --> 2811.599
but it is i don't know i thought it was

2809.359 --> 2816.2
an interesting movie i enjoyed it

2811.599 --> 2816.2000000000003
so i wanted to give it a shout out

2820.16 --> 2825.68
sea org is the scientologist that lived

2822.64 --> 2828.0
on el ron hubbard's naval ships

2825.68 --> 2828.0
what

2828.4 --> 2833.04
naval ships from el what

2831.359 --> 2836.359
did he have naval ship what are you

2833.04 --> 2836.359
talking about

2865.76 --> 2872.44
google it brother oh

2869.44 --> 2872.44
okay

2872.8 --> 2875.3590000000004
fine

2882.72 --> 2888.0789999999997
briefly commanded briefly specifically

2885.68 --> 2888.0789999999997
mentioned

2890.0 --> 2898.2
okay so it's like a little sub cult

2893.44 --> 2898.2000000000003
it's like ooh the special boys

2908.24 --> 2910.72
all right

2911.2 --> 2915.68
fine

2913.44 --> 2917.92
i guess they really like their

2915.68 --> 2919.68
experience being

2917.92 --> 2922.88
on those boats with him

2919.68 --> 2925.44
and they want to constantly

2922.88 --> 2928.44
remind everybody that they did that

2925.44 --> 2928.44
okay

2947.28 --> 2952.3190000000004
it was the strangest town i ever lived

2950.16 --> 2952.319
in

2952.72 --> 2957.7599999999998
okay

2954.319 --> 2961.72
i believe you

2957.76 --> 2961.7200000000003
it does sound pretty wacky

2973.76 --> 2979.2000000000003
wow who's down voting me today

2977.359 --> 2983.2799999999997
there haven't even been any trolls in it

2979.2 --> 2985.68
i got i already see -19 like what

2983.28 --> 2989.88
who's doing that

2985.68 --> 2989.8799999999997
there's not even trolls in here

3020.64 --> 3023.7999999999997
all right

3026.64 --> 3028.8799999999997
so

3028.96 --> 3033.44
still got an hour left in the show is

3031.44 --> 3035.599
there anything anybody would like me to

3033.44 --> 3038.559
address

3035.599 --> 3038.559
any questions

3039.28 --> 3044.3190000000004
it's all sean suck oh could be yeah sean

3042.319 --> 3046.8
is on a

3044.319 --> 3048.4
on a roll

3046.8 --> 3050.559
as in

3048.4 --> 3052.96
rolling deeper down the valley than

3050.559 --> 3055.76
anybody has ever thought was possible

3052.96 --> 3058.88
he's sinking in the swamp in there

3055.76 --> 3061.0400000000004
going nutty it made this stupid seven

3058.88 --> 3062.6400000000003
second video that was literally

3061.04 --> 3066.319
meaningless

3062.64 --> 3068.64
i think he's pissed off that people are

3066.319 --> 3071.68
ignoring him

3068.64 --> 3074.7999999999997
because he's losing his mind

3071.68 --> 3078.839
but not his eagerness to basically

3074.8 --> 3078.8390000000004
push himself on others

3082.4 --> 3086.559
and i know he doesn't like me because i

3084.64 --> 3088.24
like to laugh at him

3086.559 --> 3090.8
really

3088.24 --> 3090.7999999999997
loudly

3092.48 --> 3098.559
and just not give him any

3096.16 --> 3099.839
inkling of respect because he doesn't

3098.559 --> 3103.2000000000003
deserve any

3099.839 --> 3103.2
he's a complete freak

3104.24 --> 3110.7999999999997
like he is worse as an individual

3107.52 --> 3113.44
than any kind of straw man conception

3110.8 --> 3116.48
any glober has ever had about flat

3113.44 --> 3118.8
earthers like he is worse

3116.48 --> 3120.88
i think that other ballers are starting

3118.8 --> 3123.88
to catch on to that like this guy is

3120.88 --> 3123.88
just

3124.079 --> 3130.8
there's nothing left of him

3127.2 --> 3130.7999999999997
it's like an undead orc

3137.44 --> 3141.359
a lot of the world is losing their minds

3139.28 --> 3143.92
well not as much as you are made to

3141.359 --> 3143.92
believe though

3144.319 --> 3150.359
right

3145.599 --> 3150.3590000000004
people can handle a lot

3153.68 --> 3158.3999999999996
physically as well as mentally

3156.64 --> 3160.0789999999997
even though that's not always apparent

3158.4 --> 3163.28
because

3160.079 --> 3163.28
some people don't

3164.4 --> 3168.88
some people can't handle a lot and

3166.64 --> 3172.0789999999997
they're very reckless

3168.88 --> 3172.88
in their lives concerning it

3172.079 --> 3176.48
right

3172.88 --> 3178.8
so let's just say you're

3176.48 --> 3180.079
still young you're trying to figure

3178.8 --> 3182.6400000000003
yourself out what you're going to do

3180.079 --> 3186.1600000000003
with your life and you learn like oh

3182.64 --> 3189.1189999999997
i got this weakness like ooh

3186.16 --> 3191.52
an organ or something it's like okay

3189.119 --> 3193.2000000000003
it's inherited it's not great well what

3191.52 --> 3194.8
are you going to do

3193.2 --> 3197.68
you're just gonna say well [ __ ] it i'm

3194.8 --> 3199.28
gonna do whatever the [ __ ] comes at hand

3197.68 --> 3201.44
no matter the risk

3199.28 --> 3203.8390000000004
and then i'll just die or are you

3201.44 --> 3206.2400000000002
actually gonna

3203.839 --> 3207.359
plan out some kind of a route in your

3206.24 --> 3209.2
life to

3207.359 --> 3211.68
make sure it never comes to that and

3209.2 --> 3214.319
that you can live a very long and still

3211.68 --> 3215.7599999999998
gratifying and effective life and build

3214.319 --> 3216.88
things

3215.76 --> 3220.0
right

3216.88 --> 3221.92
well if you fall in the first category

3220.0 --> 3224.64
then that those are the people that are

3221.92 --> 3226.64
gonna stand out as like people breaking

3224.64 --> 3230.16
down

3226.64 --> 3233.359
because they let it get to that

3230.16 --> 3236.3999999999996
they let it get to that

3233.359 --> 3238.96
right the people that don't let it get

3236.4 --> 3240.079
to that you don't get to hear about them

3238.96 --> 3242.2400000000002
not not

3240.079 --> 3244.88
not a lot

3242.24 --> 3244.8799999999997
not as much

3245.68 --> 3249.44
except those that have really

3247.68 --> 3252.0789999999997
tried to embrace a

3249.44 --> 3254.2400000000002
bigger fate and destiny for themselves

3252.079 --> 3255.6800000000003
and i will try to explain that to you

3254.24 --> 3259.64
for example

3255.68 --> 3259.64
explain what's going on

3265.359 --> 3271.04
why are ye

3268.16 --> 3271.04
speaking about

3272.24 --> 3275.68
i missed some of the conversation

3273.599 --> 3276.839
nothing really special just

3275.68 --> 3281.0789999999997
all kinds of

3276.839 --> 3281.0789999999997
things moon shadow

3292.11 --> 3295.3
[Music]

3303.52 --> 3307.52
when you reprogram something what

3305.2 --> 3311.1189999999997
happens to the data

3307.52 --> 3311.119
erase loss delete it

3315.2 --> 3318.16
no

3317.359 --> 3321.839
well

3318.16 --> 3321.839
yeah if it's literally a computer

3324.16 --> 3326.3999999999996
but

3327.119 --> 3330.88
with humans it's more like it's put on

3328.88 --> 3334.1600000000003
the back burner

3330.88 --> 3335.76
and if you stay programmed for too long

3334.16 --> 3337.839
then eventually

3335.76 --> 3339.6800000000003
that back burner will kind of run out of

3337.839 --> 3343.7599999999998
fuel and you won't be able to reach it

3339.68 --> 3347.2
again unless through rigorous rigorous

3343.76 --> 3349.5200000000004
potentially fatal reconditioning

3347.2 --> 3352.64
and that's almost never worth it once

3349.52 --> 3352.64
people get fully

3354.24 --> 3357.839
indoctrinated

3355.92 --> 3359.599
and they don't want to go back they

3357.839 --> 3362.799
don't want to let it go then they

3359.599 --> 3364.319
eventually can't go back the mistake

3362.799 --> 3366.4
story

3364.319 --> 3369.68
right you make a mistake you don't

3366.4 --> 3369.6800000000003
fail to see the mistake

3371.52 --> 3374.72
and

3372.4 --> 3377.44
when you are reminded about it you

3374.72 --> 3380.0
refuse to recognize the mistake and then

3377.44 --> 3380.0
eventually

3381.28 --> 3386.0
yeah

3382.4 --> 3389.76
you see the mistake as normal and then

3386.0 --> 3393.04
the mistake becomes you it becomes

3389.76 --> 3395.0400000000004
a part of your essence

3393.04 --> 3396.24
everything you do will start to reflect

3395.04 --> 3398.16
upon it

3396.24 --> 3400.4799999999996
even though you might not consciously

3398.16 --> 3402.8799999999997
recognize that it will change you

3400.48 --> 3404.48
and then yeah if it if you keep holding

3402.88 --> 3406.0
on to blatant

3404.48 --> 3408.4
error

3406.0 --> 3410.64
then the mistake

3408.4 --> 3413.599
yeah you will become the mistake

3410.64 --> 3414.799
you will be the personification of the

3413.599 --> 3419.799
sin

3414.799 --> 3419.799
that you refuse to recognize as a sin

3430.48 --> 3436.079
we never free a mind past a certain age

3439.2 --> 3442.799
no

3439.92 --> 3442.799
no that's not it

3444.72 --> 3450.3999999999996
it's more about never free a mind past a

3448.319 --> 3453.68
certain

3450.4 --> 3457.04
conditioning time period right if

3453.68 --> 3459.04
if you get indoctrinated for too long

3457.04 --> 3460.799
then eventually you can't go back

3459.04 --> 3463.44
anymore it's not about the age

3460.799 --> 3465.52
necessarily right age

3463.44 --> 3467.92
being young is more about how flexible

3465.52 --> 3470.799
your mind is and then how well you will

3467.92 --> 3474.52
get at whatever you adapt to

3470.799 --> 3474.52
it's more about that

3475.68 --> 3479.44
it's all about

3477.44 --> 3482.799
how you want somebody to be programmed

3479.44 --> 3484.96
then it matters the age

3482.799 --> 3487.96
but not for breaking three of

3484.96 --> 3487.96
conditioning

3490.079 --> 3492.559
if you're

3497.76 --> 3502.28
i just got a link from mitchell

3505.68 --> 3509.72
as for tonight's show

3516.64 --> 3520.5589999999997
right so if you have like an old person

3518.96 --> 3522.559
that gets stuck up in certain

3520.559 --> 3525.2000000000003
conditioning

3522.559 --> 3526.2400000000002
if they break out of it like after two

3525.2 --> 3528.24
years

3526.24 --> 3530.5589999999997
like it's not like oh they're too old

3528.24 --> 3534.5589999999997
you can't break them out of something

3530.559 --> 3534.559
they've just recently been conditioning

3535.119 --> 3538.799
but it might be a little bit more

3536.559 --> 3540.2400000000002
difficult because they're less dynamic

3538.799 --> 3542.64
at that age

3540.24 --> 3545.68
not impossible it becomes impossible

3542.64 --> 3548.48
when they've had 20 years of non-stop

3545.68 --> 3550.0
indoctrination about something then

3548.48 --> 3554.599
it becomes very difficult because of the

3550.0 --> 3554.599
sheer length of the duration

3560.96 --> 3566.079
people born into hindu families are not

3563.76 --> 3571.4
a fault not being christian

3566.079 --> 3571.4
why not being christian what the hell

3575.28 --> 3578.0
i don't get it

3579.599 --> 3584.4
why would they need to change what's

3581.359 --> 3586.24
wrong with being hindu

3584.4 --> 3588.7200000000003
they have the same obstacles the same

3586.24 --> 3591.52
challenges the same

3588.72 --> 3594.3999999999996
level of gravels as christianity and

3591.52 --> 3597.2
western society so i don't see it

3594.4 --> 3599.04
i literally do not see it what you're

3597.2 --> 3601.04
talking about what's wrong with being

3599.04 --> 3602.96
born a hindu seriously

3601.04 --> 3605.119
it's all about what you're acting what

3602.96 --> 3607.2
you recognize what you understand about

3605.119 --> 3608.48
your religion about your people about

3607.2 --> 3609.5989999999997
you

3608.48 --> 3612.559
and then

3609.599 --> 3615.119
figure out morality figure out good and

3612.559 --> 3616.88
evil and the creator

3615.119 --> 3621.0
and then it doesn't really matter what

3616.88 --> 3621.0
religion you're born into

3623.87 --> 3627.42
[Music]

3630.25 --> 3633.869
[Music]

3643.359 --> 3648.0
right yeah yeah okay well look michael

3645.599 --> 3649.2000000000003
smith jr in the case of the matrix yes

3648.0 --> 3652.24
it makes sense because the

3649.2 --> 3656.0
indoctrination will be the full period

3652.24 --> 3658.24
in which somebody is part of the matrix

3656.0 --> 3660.4
yeah it's already said the longer the

3658.24 --> 3663.2799999999997
indoctrination period the more difficult

3660.4 --> 3665.6800000000003
it becomes to snap them out

3663.28 --> 3667.76
so in that sense the age

3665.68 --> 3670.64
literally matters because it's always

3667.76 --> 3672.7200000000003
going to be

3670.64 --> 3674.5589999999997
being programmed from the start so the

3672.72 --> 3676.24
younger you break out the easier it is

3674.559 --> 3678.4
to basically

3676.24 --> 3680.5589999999997
snap them out of the conditioning

3678.4 --> 3683.52
because of the length not because of the

3680.559 --> 3686.3190000000004
literal age you see

3683.52 --> 3689.119
in the matrix because the age is

3686.319 --> 3692.319
directly connected to indoctrination

3689.119 --> 3693.839
length because you're born in the matrix

3692.319 --> 3696.4
see don't

3693.839 --> 3700.16
it's not about the age

3696.4 --> 3700.1600000000003
it's about indoctrination length

3706.799 --> 3710.2
hello youtube

3724.96 --> 3730.0
not everyone is going to be right about

3727.359 --> 3730.0
a god

3733.839 --> 3738.319
you mean

3735.2 --> 3740.64
almost nobody ever

3738.319 --> 3741.92
is going to be right about a god

3740.64 --> 3744.5589999999997
how about that

3741.92 --> 3744.559
what you think

3744.88 --> 3749.039
because you follow a certain religion

3747.44 --> 3752.64
you're going to be completely right

3749.039 --> 3752.6400000000003
about god no no no

3753.68 --> 3759.8799999999997
if it was that easy

3756.48 --> 3759.88
wouldn't exist

3768.72 --> 3773.0789999999997
no youtube it's not jason mccormack

3792.64 --> 3796.839
50 socks what

3798.319 --> 3801.7599999999998
i don't know what you're talking about

3799.44 --> 3801.76
you'd

3802.24 --> 3805.0389999999998
what do i think about the new matrix

3804.079 --> 3808.2400000000002
movie

3805.039 --> 3808.2400000000002
well it's not out yet

3809.039 --> 3814.2400000000002
and i've speculated about what it's

3811.119 --> 3814.2400000000002
going to be like

3814.799 --> 3819.28
and

3816.0 --> 3819.28
i'm very skeptical

3819.92 --> 3825.44
right i mean seriously the director no

3823.52 --> 3827.359
longer has a penis

3825.44 --> 3829.359
all right i think that's gonna make an

3827.359 --> 3833.52
impact

3829.359 --> 3834.72
and yes i am joking and no i'm not

3833.52 --> 3838.52
joking

3834.72 --> 3838.52
you figure it out

3901.2 --> 3903.68
nothing

3904.72 --> 3911.0699999999997
god you guys are so

3907.06 --> 3911.07
[Music]

3917.44 --> 3922.64
i mean is there like a two minute delay

3919.599 --> 3926.599
on everything for you guys

3922.64 --> 3926.5989999999997
are you just that irresponsive

3934.72 --> 3937.839
i made a joke

3943.119 --> 3946.88
all right whatever i think about the new

3944.559 --> 3948.4
matrix movie i think they're gonna no

3946.88 --> 3950.7200000000003
there's already so much spoken about

3948.4 --> 3952.559
it's probably to be like that

3950.72 --> 3955.359
i just know i really

3952.559 --> 3955.3590000000004
disliked

3956.319 --> 3960.0389999999998
the trailer scene

3974.799 --> 3980.4
but who knows maybe it was

3977.039 --> 3980.4
yeah i mean

3982.559 --> 3986.799
the wachowski brothers even though they

3985.039 --> 3987.599
can call themselves whatever they like

3986.799 --> 3990.079
now

3987.599 --> 3993.079
they have been very creative in the past

3990.079 --> 3993.079
so

3998.16 --> 4001.839
i don't know

3999.28 --> 4004.4
it could turn out to be pretty decent

4001.839 --> 4007.839
and just different to what we expected

4004.4 --> 4007.839
what everybody expected

4010.799 --> 4016.559
right it might not it might actually be

4013.599 --> 4021.2400000000002
not half that bad

4016.559 --> 4021.2400000000002
is it going to be like the ultimate

4021.44 --> 4027.28
like reboot of matrix or like really the

4024.64 --> 4029.5989999999997
real fourth matrix

4027.28 --> 4033.1600000000003
i i kind of doubt it

4029.599 --> 4033.1600000000003
but who knows

4051.52 --> 4056.0389999999998
huh a little stone monkey 3d

4077.839 --> 4083.599
how that does kevin's experiment prove

4080.079 --> 4083.599
gravitational attraction

4085.359 --> 4087.92
it doesn't

4088.96 --> 4094.7200000000003
it's the torsion balance twist

4092.24 --> 4096.08
right it's the the twist that suggests

4094.72 --> 4098.719
that there

4096.08 --> 4100.719
that there is a force go it's just it's

4098.719 --> 4105.44
a remodeling reification so it's just

4100.719 --> 4107.6
like reifying newtonian gravity

4105.44 --> 4109.919999999999
that's it it's not even yeah it's just a

4107.6 --> 4112.0
stupid test

4109.92 --> 4114.56
and it doesn't actually prove anything

4112.0 --> 4116.159
it just shows you like yeah

4114.56 --> 4119.759
dense things

4116.159 --> 4121.92
definitely go downward yeah yeah we know

4119.759 --> 4123.52
and then that gauze causes a twist

4121.92 --> 4125.359
effect

4123.52 --> 4128.56
supposedly but

4125.359 --> 4129.759
every time that test is executed it's

4128.56 --> 4132.799
always

4129.759 --> 4136.159
it's never conclusive

4132.799 --> 4138.48
it's always going to be kind of random

4136.159 --> 4140.48
what comes out of it like inconclusive

4138.48 --> 4144.718999999999
that's what i know from it that's what i

4140.48 --> 4147.5199999999995
knew from it 20 years ago 25 years ago

4144.719 --> 4150.719
it's inconclusive it doesn't always end

4147.52 --> 4154.799000000001
up like oh they got closer no it doesn't

4150.719 --> 4154.799
it's inconclusive every time

4155.44 --> 4159.678999999999
and it's not an experiment that's

4156.96 --> 4163.319
correct it's just a test

4159.679 --> 4163.319
and it doesn't work

4179.92 --> 4184.0
what are you talking about george

4181.52 --> 4184.0
sanford

4185.279 --> 4189.839000000001
norway decide to live with

4187.44 --> 4189.839
what

4192.719 --> 4197.84
would be good if you just

4194.96 --> 4202.0
said straight out exactly what you mean

4197.84 --> 4204.32
instead of vaguely referencing something

4202.0 --> 4207.52
it's very annoying you're supposed to be

4204.32 --> 4210.239
handing out data and you just vaguely

4207.52 --> 4212.0
reference something so nobody exactly

4210.239 --> 4217.799999999999
understands what you're talking about

4212.0 --> 4217.8
that's annoying george sanford stop it

4217.92 --> 4220.96
just say what you mean

4223.44 --> 4225.5199999999995
report

4224.56 --> 4229.719
don't

4225.52 --> 4229.719
vaguely reference something

4248.0 --> 4252.48
i missed the first met no i didn't yeah

4250.32 --> 4254.159
i know sweden banned

4252.48 --> 4259.48
the v good

4254.159 --> 4259.48
under 30 not so good should be everyone

4264.88 --> 4269.36
oh so george what you meant to say is

4270.239 --> 4277.04
not norway this decide to live with

4273.199 --> 4281.12
convict business as usual just say

4277.04 --> 4285.56
norway has decided to v everyone

4281.12 --> 4285.5599999999995
just say that then

4295.52 --> 4299.4800000000005
is not doing it

4300.0 --> 4304.159
uh now you're directly see that's what i

4302.48 --> 4306.239
mean

4304.159 --> 4307.36
you're now saying the exact opposite so

4306.239 --> 4309.839999999999
how does

4307.36 --> 4312.5599999999995
norway is not doing any of the mandates

4309.84 --> 4315.12
and all that how does that

4312.56 --> 4317.52
reflect upon what you said earlier has

4315.12 --> 4319.04
decided to live with the business that

4317.52 --> 4321.1990000000005
makes no sense you're literally

4319.04 --> 4324.56
contradicting yourself and it pisses me

4321.199 --> 4326.159
off you constantly do that

4324.56 --> 4329.84
could you be a little bit more careful

4326.159 --> 4329.839999999999
about what you put down

4330.08 --> 4334.84
it's really getting annoying george

4346.719 --> 4353.04
don't vaguely blabber about things that

4350.08 --> 4354.239
are really life and death situations in

4353.04 --> 4356.239
reality

4354.239 --> 4358.48
just say it as it is because it's

4356.239 --> 4360.32
starting to piss me off that you do that

4358.48 --> 4362.5599999999995
and everybody else here that goes the

4360.32 --> 4362.5599999999995
same

4363.44 --> 4367.44
oh seeking star wars you understand

4365.84 --> 4370.56
exactly so

4367.44 --> 4374.639999999999
how do

4370.56 --> 4377.52
norway has decided to live with convict

4374.64 --> 4380.400000000001
business as usual how

4377.52 --> 4383.6
does that match

4380.4 --> 4386.4
norway is not doing any mandates or

4383.6 --> 4388.4800000000005
lockdowns or forced fees how do

4386.4 --> 4391.44
those two match you seem to understand

4388.48 --> 4393.199
it so perfectly seeking star wars how do

4391.44 --> 4396.4
those two match

4393.199 --> 4399.839999999999
why don't you explain that

4396.4 --> 4399.839999999999
if you understand so perfectly

4439.04 --> 4444.159
means no worries

4441.12 --> 4444.159
oh really so

4448.48 --> 4452.599999999999
i don't see that at all

4454.64 --> 4458.56
you know when somebody reference oh

4456.64 --> 4462.159000000001
decide to live with confident that kind

4458.56 --> 4463.92
of means to me like oh so they accept

4462.159 --> 4466.4
this spell and everything that comes

4463.92 --> 4467.92
with it with it especially if the word

4466.4 --> 4470.639999999999
business is right

4467.92 --> 4473.28
right directly involved and as usual so

4470.64 --> 4475.360000000001
i don't see how that says oh nothing to

4473.28 --> 4476.8
worry about

4475.36 --> 4478.159
unless it's

4476.8 --> 4479.92
really

4478.159 --> 4482.239
really dark

4479.92 --> 4484.4800000000005
bad sarcasm

4482.239 --> 4488.759999999999
which is very out of place

4484.48 --> 4488.759999999999
to put that into place like that

4497.44 --> 4501.44
it is worth obsessing over it's called

4499.76 --> 4504.0
specificity

4501.44 --> 4506.0
and not blabbering

4504.0 --> 4509.679
especially when you're talking about

4506.0 --> 4511.84
life and death concerning situations

4509.679 --> 4514.2390000000005
like not sloppily going around like

4511.84 --> 4515.92
you're some overlord

4514.239 --> 4517.5199999999995
you're not

4515.92 --> 4519.36
okay

4517.52 --> 4521.52
so when you're talking about life and

4519.36 --> 4523.679
death situations out there you might

4521.52 --> 4526.320000000001
want to be a little bit more specific

4523.679 --> 4531.28
instead of just sloppily just joking and

4526.32 --> 4534.239
being really dark sarcastic about things

4531.28 --> 4534.239
huh how about that

4537.199 --> 4542.0
because it's not

4538.4 --> 4544.879999999999
funny you understand it's not funny

4542.0 --> 4549.0
it's not the place to start joking

4544.88 --> 4549.0
around like it's funny

4558.32 --> 4561.509999999999
[Music]

4561.84 --> 4567.64
oh you everybody understand who the [ __ ]

4564.32 --> 4567.639999999999
are you dude

4569.84 --> 4575.92
yeah business as usual means just

4572.8 --> 4575.92
everyday occurrence

4576.48 --> 4581.44
how does business as usual

4579.6 --> 4584.0
yeah

4581.44 --> 4585.12
how does that fit the rest of the

4584.0 --> 4587.44
sentence

4585.12 --> 4590.0
norway has decided to live with

4587.44 --> 4591.28
confident how does that

4590.0 --> 4594.719
fit

4591.28 --> 4595.679
that sentence everybody that gets it so

4594.719 --> 4597.92
well

4595.679 --> 4600.4800000000005
do you really get it or you're just

4597.92 --> 4601.92
really sloppy

4600.48 --> 4604.799999999999
what is it

4601.92 --> 4607.28
you think you're so freaking insightful

4604.8 --> 4609.76
just because you follow me

4607.28 --> 4613.04
you think that insightfulness that is

4609.76 --> 4614.88
inherent to my being my genetics just

4613.04 --> 4616.88
rubs off on you

4614.88 --> 4618.96
because you're in my chat i don't think

4616.88 --> 4622.679
so

4618.96 --> 4622.679
why don't you get real

4633.199 --> 4637.4
oh man dusty ryder

4639.04 --> 4642.8
that's that's rough bro i hope it works

4641.679 --> 4646.76
out

4642.8 --> 4646.76
be very careful with that

4669.44 --> 4675.12
how is that live with it

4672.48 --> 4678.08
how is that how is living with a mind

4675.12 --> 4680.76
control situation

4678.08 --> 4684.84
it doesn't make logical sense it's an

4680.76 --> 4684.84
ill-constructed sentence

4697.92 --> 4702.159
and besides there's no comma there

4700.08 --> 4704.8
either right so

4702.159 --> 4707.679
we've decided to i read it like this

4704.8 --> 4710.159000000001
decide to live with convict business

4707.679 --> 4712.0
as usual yeah you know how i interpret

4710.159 --> 4715.199
that

4712.0 --> 4717.84
it means yeah they're just taking it

4715.199 --> 4719.678999999999
because it is business that's exactly

4717.84 --> 4721.92
what the whole thing is it's business

4719.679 --> 4725.679
it's a giant corporate conspiracy so if

4721.92 --> 4727.36
you're gonna live with the sea business

4725.679 --> 4729.92
as usual

4727.36 --> 4734.04
and without a comma in there yeah how do

4729.92 --> 4734.04
you think i'm gonna read that

4734.88 --> 4738.719
it's just

4736.159 --> 4743.48
not carefully you're not careful you

4738.719 --> 4743.4800000000005
should be this is life and death stuff

4749.36 --> 4757.0
seriously oh it's all arwen oh you all

4752.4 --> 4757.0
understood it oh really did you

4764.96 --> 4768.32
no capital letters

4766.719 --> 4771.04
right yeah yeah

4768.32 --> 4772.5599999999995
language is important i train on it a

4771.04 --> 4775.12
lot

4772.56 --> 4778.0
and i expect everybody to trade on it a

4775.12 --> 4779.199
lot because you can't get precise if you

4778.0 --> 4780.159
do it

4779.199 --> 4783.759999999999
through

4780.159 --> 4786.5599999999995
sloppy language use

4783.76 --> 4788.719
i'm not gonna be like a literal english

4786.56 --> 4789.679
teacher or anything

4788.719 --> 4793.199
but

4789.679 --> 4796.4
here is an example how it matters how it

4793.199 --> 4799.44
matters a lot you actually have to look

4796.4 --> 4801.28
at what you're writing

4799.44 --> 4802.4
figure out hey

4801.28 --> 4805.5199999999995
could

4802.4 --> 4808.4
this quick blurt out be read maybe

4805.52 --> 4810.88
incorrectly i might want to

4808.4 --> 4812.32
put the dots on the eyes as they used to

4810.88 --> 4813.92
say

4812.32 --> 4815.679
when it was actually

4813.92 --> 4817.36
written

4815.679 --> 4819.12
physically written

4817.36 --> 4821.599999999999
but you might want to put the commas and

4819.12 --> 4823.5199999999995
the capital letters etc etc because it

4821.6 --> 4824.88
does matter especially when you're

4823.52 --> 4828.360000000001
talking about

4824.88 --> 4831.04
out there in the world life and death

4828.36 --> 4832.5599999999995
situations you might want to take that

4831.04 --> 4834.96
serious

4832.56 --> 4834.96
you know

4836.0 --> 4839.04
language matters

4840.88 --> 4844.639
right

4842.08 --> 4848.08
there's a war and the general can't even

4844.639 --> 4850.400000000001
freaking talk his own language

4848.08 --> 4852.32
you think he should be a general or he

4850.4 --> 4856.08
should be a grunt

4852.32 --> 4856.08
that just does the physical action

4857.44 --> 4861.839999999999
no if

4858.8 --> 4861.84
when you're talking

4862.159 --> 4868.08
it's important that you are precise

4865.92 --> 4869.52
especially when it's a life and death

4868.08 --> 4872.92
situation

4869.52 --> 4872.92
like a war

4889.04 --> 4895.84
see the words business as usual together

4892.159 --> 4895.839999999999
they same as one phrase

4898.8 --> 4903.28
well look maybe if you were face to face

4901.6 --> 4905.679
just talking

4903.28 --> 4909.199
on the street corner or whatever or at

4905.679 --> 4911.28
the bus stop yeah sure

4909.199 --> 4914.159
but this is written and you're talking

4911.28 --> 4916.239
about a life and death situation it's

4914.159 --> 4918.879999999999
just inappropriate it's even

4916.239 --> 4921.678999999999
inappropriate to apply that

4918.88 --> 4924.639
it's dark there's nothing business as

4921.679 --> 4924.639
usual about it

4927.28 --> 4930.88
ah and i'm

4928.88 --> 4932.8
done hammering on this

4930.88 --> 4934.56
but it needs to happen because everybody

4932.8 --> 4937.04
was getting all sleepy and it's starting

4934.56 --> 4940.2390000000005
to piss me off and i'm looking at my

4937.04 --> 4944.639
chat with freaking six minutes in

4940.239 --> 4946.5599999999995
between comments okay that pisses me off

4944.639 --> 4949.04
i interact with my chat if people are

4946.56 --> 4952.56
just gonna sit there sleepy doing

4949.04 --> 4954.36
nothing and then blabbering out sloppily

4952.56 --> 4956.639
reddit

4954.36 --> 4959.44
ill-humored comments

4956.639 --> 4961.92
it pisses me off

4959.44 --> 4962.96
and i'm talking to my actual audience

4961.92 --> 4965.4400000000005
now

4962.96 --> 4969.32
why don't you wake the [ __ ] up and get a

4965.44 --> 4969.32
little serious here

4973.36 --> 4976.92
it's called vigilance

4987.92 --> 4992.719
no cps i am used to the phrase and

4990.56 --> 4994.88
there's a time and a place for those

4992.719 --> 4997.6
things

4994.88 --> 4997.6
talking about

4998.639 --> 5002.84
countries dealing with

5001.199 --> 5006.638999999999
death cults

5002.84 --> 5010.56
indoctrination situations is not one of

5006.639 --> 5014.96
those places do you understand

5010.56 --> 5017.679
it's not the time and place to talk

5014.96 --> 5018.639
casually about that [ __ ]

5017.679 --> 5019.6
ever

5018.639 --> 5021.84
ever

5019.6 --> 5025.52
never do that

5021.84 --> 5028.4800000000005
don't downplay the freaking war that is

5025.52 --> 5033.159000000001
killing people around you

5028.48 --> 5034.879999999999
don't downplay that with casual sloppy

5033.159 --> 5036.4
ill-mannered

5034.88 --> 5038.719
ill-humored

5036.4 --> 5042.04
banter [ __ ]

5038.719 --> 5042.04
get serious

5044.64 --> 5053.109
[Music]

5063.12 --> 5067.04
oh jesus dusty ryder

5067.84 --> 5071.679
there's no treatment

5070.88 --> 5074.08
okay

5071.679 --> 5076.159
this might sound crazy but

5074.08 --> 5078.159
i think you probably tried it it's been

5076.159 --> 5080.879999999999
for seven years but

5078.159 --> 5083.36
you ever tried

5080.88 --> 5085.6
concentrated cbd oil

5083.36 --> 5088.0
and you might want to use the thc on top

5085.6 --> 5088.0
of that

5090.08 --> 5092.4
maybe

5092.719 --> 5096.96
where are you at you're in france or

5094.8 --> 5100.08
something right that's difficult

5096.96 --> 5101.92
uh maybe spit was it spain

5100.08 --> 5103.92
well maybe you could get it or you could

5101.92 --> 5105.679
find somebody

5103.92 --> 5107.6
in like uh

5105.679 --> 5109.4400000000005
like the smoke clubs over there if

5107.6 --> 5112.4800000000005
they're still legal

5109.44 --> 5116.879999999999
to make it for you like adam meekin does

5112.48 --> 5116.879999999999
because that stuff saves lives

5118.639 --> 5122.159000000001
have you tried a dusty writer

5122.96 --> 5128.32
like even in late stage it it can still

5126.08 --> 5130.4
do miracles

5128.32 --> 5132.4
especially with cancer

5130.4 --> 5134.5599999999995
have you tried it

5132.4 --> 5134.5599999999995
like

5134.639 --> 5137.88
high dosage

5142.0 --> 5148.08
like the directly super dark green

5144.8 --> 5148.08
sticky paste stuff

5150.239 --> 5156.239
and if especially if it's

5152.96 --> 5156.2390000000005
now throughout the body man

5157.44 --> 5161.199
anyway if you haven't tried that it's

5159.199 --> 5162.239
worth a shot you know if if is in that

5161.199 --> 5166.199
stage

5162.239 --> 5166.199
who knows it might help

5181.44 --> 5185.12
uh come on cps don't

5190.4 --> 5194.879999999999
you we're hoping to get in touch with

5192.08 --> 5194.88
adam all right

5195.28 --> 5198.88
oh adam is on skype

5200.49 --> 5207.5199999999995
[Music]

5202.239 --> 5207.5199999999995
i do i could give you his skype address

5207.679 --> 5212.32
if you want to you i could bring you in

5209.44 --> 5212.32
touch with adam

5213.679 --> 5219.12
so i take it you haven't tried it out

5216.0 --> 5224.04
yet you haven't tried the

5219.12 --> 5224.04
concentrated cbd thc extract

5232.48 --> 5238.159
oh okay cps yep

5235.84 --> 5239.92
i lost my mother to cancer too two

5238.159 --> 5242.92
thousand

5239.92 --> 5242.92
five

5255.92 --> 5260.96
would be awesome not no to the th well

5259.04 --> 5264.96
you might want to reconsider that dusty

5260.96 --> 5268.4800000000005
writer especially if it is in such a

5264.96 --> 5271.28
that situation because the thc

5268.48 --> 5273.919999999999
actually works in conjunction with the

5271.28 --> 5273.92
cbd

5277.04 --> 5284.0
so you might want to leave some of that

5279.04 --> 5284.0
in there because it it works together

5284.4 --> 5292.12
but you should ask adam

5288.0 --> 5292.12
he knows everything about that

5297.6 --> 5302.04
i'll i'm actually gonna type a message

5302.25 --> 5305.449
[Applause]

5309.09 --> 5312.829
[Applause]

5315.31 --> 5321.9490000000005
[Applause]

5324.03 --> 5344.3589999999995
[Applause]

5355.199 --> 5359.32
right i relayed the message

5367.76 --> 5373.6
right but hey sirius does to your writer

5370.56 --> 5376.080000000001
if you have not tried this out yet

5373.6 --> 5379.719
i take it you haven't

5376.08 --> 5379.719
you might be surprised

5381.36 --> 5384.36
seriously

5402.25 --> 5405.34
[Music]

5418.96 --> 5422.88
i haven't tried dude

5420.56 --> 5426.159000000001
before you do anything

5422.88 --> 5428.400000000001
try it first seriously

5426.159 --> 5432.0
don't go for

5428.4 --> 5433.92
yeah i'm not a medical expert

5432.0 --> 5437.84
i'm not a doctor i'm not a registered

5433.92 --> 5440.4800000000005
doctor but i say don't let them perform

5437.84 --> 5441.96
any surgery

5440.48 --> 5445.36
or

5441.96 --> 5448.8
chemotherapy or radiation nothing don't

5445.36 --> 5450.96
try anything

5448.8 --> 5452.08
before you have tried

5450.96 --> 5455.52
the oil

5452.08 --> 5455.5199999999995
the specific concentrate

5455.76 --> 5458.159000000001
because

5458.239 --> 5465.5199999999995
yeah botched operations

5462.0 --> 5466.32
can actually aggravate everything

5465.52 --> 5469.84
like

5466.32 --> 5472.88
my mother had a failed cancer operation

5469.84 --> 5475.12
and she died very quickly after

5472.88 --> 5475.12
like

5475.36 --> 5479.5199999999995
like

5476.48 --> 5479.5199999999995
three or four months

5481.28 --> 5485.199
because once you start cutting in cancer

5484.159 --> 5488.0
tissue

5485.199 --> 5491.839999999999
and you don't perfectly remove it

5488.0 --> 5491.84
it becomes more aggressive

5492.56 --> 5496.719
it usually does it's dangerous

5495.679 --> 5499.719
so

5496.719 --> 5499.719
yeah

5509.36 --> 5512.799999999999
three experimental two

5512.96 --> 5520.719
god why didn't you go for the cannabis

5516.639 --> 5523.679
always go for that first always always

5520.719 --> 5526.56
never ever anything else

5523.679 --> 5531.1990000000005
always that first always

5526.56 --> 5531.1990000000005
if that doesn't work yeah then sure

5531.44 --> 5539.04
experimental that just always always

5536.0 --> 5540.239
always cannabis first not like smoking

5539.04 --> 5541.84
and [ __ ]

5540.239 --> 5545.839999999999
that doesn't really help no you have to

5541.84 --> 5547.360000000001
get the concentrated extract always try

5545.84 --> 5551.04
that first

5547.36 --> 5554.48
inc in relation to cancer always always

5551.04 --> 5555.92
try that first always try that first

5554.48 --> 5560.12
always

5555.92 --> 5560.12
try that first

5561.28 --> 5566.719
you didn't i i don't know how you could

5563.199 --> 5566.719
have avoided knowing that

5566.96 --> 5571.679
but yeah

5568.719 --> 5571.679
better late than never

5572.159 --> 5576.32
rick simpson oil yeah pretty much

5578.0 --> 5583.6
but yeah that's like

5581.28 --> 5586.0
what is it now 50 years ago or so that's

5583.6 --> 5586.0
older

5586.08 --> 5590.639
adam knows what he's doing right there's

5588.719 --> 5594.639
been a lot of

5590.639 --> 5596.719
uh cannabis strain developments a lot of

5594.639 --> 5598.32
breeding with some very interesting

5596.719 --> 5601.199
results

5598.32 --> 5604.4
it may actually work even better now

5601.199 --> 5607.839999999999
because trains have been bred

5604.4 --> 5609.28
to accomplish the rest restoratory

5607.84 --> 5613.28
effects

5609.28 --> 5613.28
even better than they used to

5614.08 --> 5620.4
just drop the like jesus

5617.199 --> 5620.4
yeah oh god

5620.8 --> 5625.92
i'm glad you did stop that don't try

5623.92 --> 5627.4400000000005
anything else

5625.92 --> 5628.2390000000005
this is

5627.44 --> 5629.5199999999995
like

5628.239 --> 5632.799999999999
never

5629.52 --> 5635.84
try the oil first

5632.8 --> 5639.54
and of course make sure that just like

5635.84 --> 5642.649
plenty of vitamin c and all that right

5639.54 --> 5642.649
[Music]

5643.12 --> 5647.679
it's not like oh don't take anything

5645.199 --> 5650.0
just don't go for weird experimental

5647.679 --> 5650.0
stuff

5650.719 --> 5656.719
this the the oil is not experimental

5653.92 --> 5658.4
it's like tested

5656.719 --> 5660.88
it's famous for it

5658.4 --> 5662.4
um among those that know and have tried

5660.88 --> 5665.92
it

5662.4 --> 5666.96
high success rate especially in cases

5665.92 --> 5668.88
where

5666.96 --> 5671.84
like all hope has been given up it's

5668.88 --> 5673.76
like yeah i have one month to

5671.84 --> 5675.52
and then they tried and it just goes

5673.76 --> 5678.08
away like

5675.52 --> 5680.639
entirely out of nowhere even though they

5678.08 --> 5684.119
expect it to die any moment basically

5680.639 --> 5684.119
like really

5689.36 --> 5693.36
yeah you can't find any proper re why do

5691.36 --> 5695.92
you think that is

5693.36 --> 5697.92
global mcglobe face why do you think you

5695.92 --> 5701.04
can't find anything on that could it be

5697.92 --> 5705.92
because cancer industry is one of the

5701.04 --> 5708.639
biggest medical industries in the world

5705.92 --> 5710.4
corporate driven medical industry you

5708.639 --> 5712.08
think that they like

5710.4 --> 5715.199
people to know

5712.08 --> 5716.719
that there is like almost considerably a

5715.199 --> 5718.799999999999
cure-all

5716.719 --> 5722.4
for the entire thing that yields the

5718.8 --> 5724.4800000000005
biggest profits ever

5722.4 --> 5727.5199999999995
in the medical industry

5724.48 --> 5728.5599999999995
yeah why do you think they can't find it

5727.52 --> 5730.080000000001
because it's

5728.56 --> 5732.639
that gets removed

5730.08 --> 5734.32
the censorship wars hit

5732.639 --> 5736.08
that sort of thing

5734.32 --> 5739.44
very early on

5736.08 --> 5741.76
like starting 15 years ago very early on

5739.44 --> 5745.119
it started hitting that way before

5741.76 --> 5747.1990000000005
anything else got censored

5745.119 --> 5748.799999999999
like when they attacked censorship

5747.199 --> 5749.919999999999
attacked and all that

5748.8 --> 5751.119000000001
medical

5749.92 --> 5754.8
doctors

5751.119 --> 5756.719
for stepping outside of the norm

5754.8 --> 5757.92
they especially went for that sort of

5756.719 --> 5762.08
thing

5757.92 --> 5764.4800000000005
there were great documentaries in the

5762.08 --> 5767.44
google video days

5764.48 --> 5767.44
before youtube

5768.4 --> 5771.199
or before youtube become became really

5770.4 --> 5772.799999999999
big

5771.199 --> 5775.44
and was bought up by google there was

5772.8 --> 5777.92
google video there were like great

5775.44 --> 5779.919999999999
movies especially about

5777.92 --> 5781.04
yeah the rick simpson oil

5779.92 --> 5782.32
and

5781.04 --> 5784.719
a hundred

5782.32 --> 5787.5199999999995
cures for cancer and

5784.719 --> 5789.92
so many great great videos that just

5787.52 --> 5793.1990000000005
showed you like you know

5789.92 --> 5796.08
everything else but mainstream medicine

5793.199 --> 5799.04
works better to treat cancer everything

5796.08 --> 5801.36
else works better everything else works

5799.04 --> 5801.36
better

5807.679 --> 5812.6
derived from deep sea creatures what

5812.719 --> 5815.04
weird

5817.76 --> 5822.719
right so yeah for your information

5821.199 --> 5825.04
our bodies

5822.719 --> 5829.04
has specific

5825.04 --> 5831.04
designed by god cannot be removed

5829.04 --> 5834.48
designed by god

5831.04 --> 5835.76
cannabinoid receptors on a cellular

5834.48 --> 5839.04
level

5835.76 --> 5840.88
yeah we have specific receptor for the

5839.04 --> 5842.32
unique substances

5840.88 --> 5844.08
that are in

5842.32 --> 5845.759999999999
cannabis plants

5844.08 --> 5848.88
you think that might be for a reason

5845.76 --> 5852.56
that we have that inherently designed by

5848.88 --> 5855.56
the original designer of life

5852.56 --> 5855.56
yeah

5858.4 --> 5862.48
because we're supposed to use that

5862.56 --> 5869.92
it was designed for us to use

5866.08 --> 5871.84
literally designed by god

5869.92 --> 5875.1990000000005
we have specific

5871.84 --> 5876.4800000000005
built in on a genetic level cannabinoid

5875.199 --> 5878.08
receptors

5876.48 --> 5881.28
that work for

5878.08 --> 5882.8
this yeah that restoration process

5881.28 --> 5886.239
right

5882.8 --> 5890.159000000001
that's kind of an important fact

5886.239 --> 5893.599999999999
fact genetic medical fact

5890.159 --> 5894.5599999999995
that should be universally known

5893.6 --> 5898.2390000000005
and it's

5894.56 --> 5901.360000000001
not very popular among

5898.239 --> 5903.119
pharmaceutical industries

5901.36 --> 5904.88
yeah

5903.119 --> 5907.36
and that's why you can't really find a

5904.88 --> 5910.639
lot of information very quickly with

5907.36 --> 5912.4
search results about this you really

5910.639 --> 5914.96
have to know where to dig you have to

5912.4 --> 5919.119
know the names

5914.96 --> 5921.679
you have to bypass all the the paid for

5919.119 --> 5922.799999999999
propaganda against it

5921.679 --> 5926.719
black

5922.8 --> 5929.28
black males [ __ ] shaming just nonsense

5926.719 --> 5929.28
slander

5932.239 --> 5936.04
not a fact though

5938.08 --> 5942.159
you found it in seconds oh lucky you

5940.56 --> 5946.320000000001
cbs

5942.159 --> 5946.32
for some it will not be easily found

5947.679 --> 5952.88
opioid receptors

5949.76 --> 5956.0
yeah but you see clearly opioid receptor

5952.88 --> 5957.36
we make opioids you understand we

5956.0 --> 5959.679
literally

5957.36 --> 5961.92
it's part of our inner metabolism it's

5959.679 --> 5964.0
part of our hormonal cycle we have

5961.92 --> 5966.08
opioid receptors right

5964.0 --> 5968.719
yeah we can get it externally but we

5966.08 --> 5973.36
literally make it in our bodies

5968.719 --> 5973.36
we don't make cannabinoids in our bodies

5973.84 --> 5980.400000000001
and weirdly enough maybe

5977.119 --> 5981.679
in ancient history we actually did

5980.4 --> 5982.48
and then

5981.679 --> 5984.88
that

5982.48 --> 5987.36
ability was taken from us the same might

5984.88 --> 5989.28
go for vitamin c you know that most

5987.36 --> 5991.44
animals actually produce their own

5989.28 --> 5993.599999999999
vitamin c in their body

5991.44 --> 5994.799999999999
we don't

5993.6 --> 5997.4400000000005
it's weird

5994.8 --> 5997.4400000000005
but we don't

5997.84 --> 6001.6
so maybe

5999.119 --> 6003.759999999999
at a time we also had

6001.6 --> 6008.679
we would be able to produce our own

6003.76 --> 6008.679
cannabinoids but we can't now

6016.56 --> 6022.679
oh that's interesting mother's milk can

6019.119 --> 6022.679
contain endocannabinoids

6023.04 --> 6027.92
could that also have involvement of said

6025.52 --> 6029.4400000000005
mother actually taking cannabinoid

6027.92 --> 6033.84
cannabis

6029.44 --> 6033.839999999999
i don't know might be but interesting

6034.159 --> 6037.839999999999
i didn't know that that's interesting

6044.4 --> 6050.5599999999995
all right

6046.239 --> 6054.0
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6050.56 --> 6058.84
i'm glad it got rolling thank you

6054.0 --> 6058.84
dusty ryder for breaking that ice

6064.0 --> 6068.0

6104.8 --> 6108.96
all right i didn't know that i knew that
