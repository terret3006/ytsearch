so at the end of the show

163.92 --> 173.35999999999999
i recommend you re-watch this stream

168.0 --> 173.36
at the beginning i had a special

174.239 --> 179.36
little halloween surprise there it's a

177.599 --> 182.72
joke

179.36 --> 185.59900000000002
ah a little easter egg

182.72 --> 188.08
halloween egg whatever ah hey random

185.599 --> 188.07999999999998
explorer

192.239 --> 199.84
huh well it sounds great

196.159 --> 199.84
anyway i got green tea with me

202.48 --> 207.51899999999998
so yeah it's sunday uh

207.599 --> 214.879
apparently it was halloween night

210.959 --> 214.879
last last night i think

216.48 --> 220.959
i did actually have a bit of a weird

218.48 --> 224.0
moment going to sleep

220.959 --> 226.799
but i didn't get any like creepy dreams

224.0 --> 229.84
or anything

226.799 --> 231.68
uh but it was a little there was some

229.84 --> 234.0
weird tension in here going on

231.68 --> 235.439
but yeah it never really got to me so i

234.0 --> 240.0
felt pretty good

235.439 --> 242.72
all throughout the evening and night

240.0 --> 245.04
yeah didn't go to bed too incredibly

242.72 --> 246.879
late

245.04 --> 250.4
and oh yeah and i think there was

246.879 --> 252.72
actually a full moon yesterday night

250.4 --> 254.64000000000001
and it was also very high i noticed that

252.72 --> 256.32
the moon was standing at a very high

254.64 --> 259.12
point it was like

256.32 --> 259.12
right up there

263.87 --> 267.36
[Music]

265.28 --> 269.44
i take it you mean the moon was totally

267.36 --> 272.8
blocked for you

269.44 --> 282.24
agm because if you're blocking the moon

272.8 --> 284.8
it should just get out of the way

282.24 --> 286.479
yeah and i also noticed that with yeah

284.8 --> 288.0
but typically when it's bright

286.479 --> 297.84
but it really stood out to me that it

288.0 --> 297.84
was like really really bright

302.4 --> 313.94899999999996
ah right hey jim okay oh too bad for you

310.8 --> 313.949
[Music]

315.12 --> 320.0
right i know what you meant agm was just

317.44 --> 320.0
playing around

322.639 --> 327.6
right so yesterday unlike what i said on

326.4 --> 331.039
my show

327.6 --> 333.28000000000003
there was not a live ball busters ugh

331.039 --> 335.12
so crazy because i thought that worby

333.28 --> 338.23999999999995
was

335.12 --> 339.36
but i must have mixed it up i think i

338.24 --> 342.88
asked

339.36 --> 345.84000000000003
john like after

342.88 --> 346.8
the qe live was over in the ball yeah in

345.84 --> 349.919
the panel

346.8 --> 350.639
after in the after panel and he said no

349.919 --> 352.88
but

350.639 --> 354.96000000000004
i thought it was yes anyway anyway there

352.88 --> 357.199
was just a premiere

354.96 --> 358.08
that wasn't there live was hanging in

357.199 --> 360.24
the in the

358.08 --> 361.75899999999996
pool buster's panel waiting for for

360.24 --> 365.199
somebody to get in

361.759 --> 367.84000000000003
it was nothing but oh well

365.199 --> 367.84000000000003
uh

373.199 --> 379.039
all right also i had a really good phone

376.4 --> 381.44
call with my dad

379.039 --> 383.52
who was giving some introspective

381.44 --> 386.8
details which i shall not

383.52 --> 387.19899999999996
reveal but yeah my dad doesn't really

386.8 --> 389.759
talk

387.199 --> 390.479
too much about that sort of thing so

389.759 --> 395.68
that was like

390.479 --> 397.84
really interesting and i agreed

395.68 --> 399.039
like i'm i'm seriously impressed with my

397.84 --> 401.35999999999996
dad nowadays

399.039 --> 402.96
which is such a relief because like 20

401.36 --> 405.68
years ago 30 years ago

402.96 --> 405.68
not so much

407.52 --> 412.4
but yeah yeah he has he's making plans

411.12 --> 415.12
basically for his

412.4 --> 417.28
future because it seems like he's

415.12 --> 418.479
completed the cycle he set out for

417.28 --> 421.039
himself

418.479 --> 422.4
which now is should be around 10 years

421.039 --> 424.56
ago

422.4 --> 424.82
and he's crushing it with what he's

424.56 --> 426.08
doing

424.82 --> 428.4
[Music]

426.08 --> 430.8
being very active being building

428.4 --> 435.19899999999996
constantly

430.8 --> 438.56
working on things on networks on yeah on

435.199 --> 441.84000000000003
on the house a lot of uh

438.56 --> 444.08
yeah rebuilding rearranging

441.84 --> 446.56
but like good stuff i've seen that

444.08 --> 447.44
progress like over the last two years at

446.56 --> 450.479
least

447.44 --> 451.12
it really stood out like wow that place

450.479 --> 455.28
looks like

451.12 --> 455.28000000000003
amazingly luxurious now

462.24 --> 467.44
planets were visible i i didn't see all

465.599 --> 470.87899999999996
that much i did notice the moon but

467.44 --> 473.12
it was still somewhat cloudy

470.879 --> 474.8
but yeah not enough to stop the moon but

473.12 --> 478.56
yeah i couldn't see much of the

474.8 --> 481.36
the star sky or the planets or anything

478.56 --> 483.36
and it was like late anyway and cold and

481.36 --> 484.56
windy didn't really feel like hanging

483.36 --> 487.12
around

484.56 --> 487.12
outside

487.759 --> 492.319
mostly just stayed in watched a lot a

489.919 --> 496.639
lot a lot a lot of silly videos

492.319 --> 498.639
that i like the guy even went live

496.639 --> 501.12
but it was just playing some shooter not

498.639 --> 503.36
too interesting

501.12 --> 503.36
but

505.52 --> 509.84
yeah it's just halloween

510.96 --> 521.8389999999999
nothing too eventful

524.48 --> 529.6800000000001
a planet is a wandering star george

532.839 --> 535.839
sanford

543.6 --> 549.839
yeah welcome by the way

556.8 --> 565.1999999999999
right uh did i watch something

562.24 --> 567.12
i did take there were some reviews of

565.2 --> 570.88
well surprise surprise

567.12 --> 574.8
horror movies oh what

570.88 --> 577.92
horror movie reviews during halloween

574.8 --> 581.3599999999999
how unexpected yeah no

577.92 --> 584.24
but yeah what was again there was

581.36 --> 585.2
one movie that kind of seemed halfway

584.24 --> 587.279
interesting

585.2 --> 589.36
which was supposedly a netflix came out

587.279 --> 592.08
so i might watch that

589.36 --> 594.32
don't even remember the name of it hold

592.08 --> 594.32
on

597.36 --> 600.0
was it again

603.12 --> 609.44
although it might be yet

606.88 --> 610.399
very liberal in certain ways oh yeah his

609.44 --> 615.519
house

610.399 --> 619.839
about some african migrants

615.519 --> 619.839
that move into a ghost house

620.48 --> 626.9590000000001
and i don't know despite

623.839 --> 630.5600000000001
liberal influences i think it might as a

626.959 --> 632.4799999999999
like as a technical movie

630.56 --> 633.92
what i heard about it and the scenes

632.48 --> 637.519
that i did see it was

633.92 --> 640.8
very successful at building real tension

637.519 --> 644.24
and not being cheap as jump scares and

640.8 --> 645.1999999999999
super super annoying people constantly

644.24 --> 647.519
nagging on you

645.2 --> 649.0400000000001
which is what most horror movies these

647.519 --> 651.279
days are

649.04 --> 652.399
although there are some good ones spooky

651.279 --> 655.8389999999999
ones although yeah

652.399 --> 656.48
usually too much cgi this seemed kind of

655.839 --> 659.519
different

656.48 --> 663.2
it so i i might watch that

659.519 --> 667.04
maybe tonight his house

663.2 --> 667.0400000000001
on netflix anyway

673.279 --> 678.16
what else what else stream

681.76 --> 688.399
all right oh rodrigo did a halloween

684.72 --> 691.6800000000001
special but i missed that just

688.399 --> 695.12
overlooked it oh yeah and geo shifter

691.68 --> 695.12
did this weird video

698.0 --> 703.839
let me see in the comments because i did

699.92 --> 703.8389999999999
commented a lot on that one

726.88 --> 732.88
hmm right uh

730.88 --> 735.6
anyway yeah that was all it was pretty

732.88 --> 735.6
quiet evening

737.2 --> 741.279
surprising for saturday really

742.839 --> 748.48
um oh yeah

745.519 --> 750.9590000000001
i did something weird i had my dinner

748.48 --> 750.9590000000001
early

751.04 --> 754.7199999999999
like usually i get oh this sounds so

753.519 --> 757.839
bland but

754.72 --> 762.0790000000001
normally regularly i eat fries

757.839 --> 762.0790000000001
in the somewhat late afternoon

762.32 --> 767.279
and then lit much later but before the

765.36 --> 769.76
night i then eat like a

767.279 --> 771.519
solid meal like a hamburger or something

769.76 --> 776.639
or

771.519 --> 778.5600000000001
yeah more than just a bunch of fries

776.639 --> 780.399
and this time i switched it around

778.56 --> 784.3199999999999
because i don't know i was having some

780.399 --> 787.04
stomach issues and i just felt i need

784.32 --> 787.44
the more rich stuff because there's also

787.04 --> 790.48
like

787.44 --> 794.5600000000001
a chili pepper in there fresh

790.48 --> 796.32
just like that no seeds of course but

794.56 --> 799.3599999999999
and yeah that did me a lot of good i

796.32 --> 803.7600000000001
think that i did that yesterday

799.36 --> 803.76
so i don't know i feel well rested

804.48 --> 807.76
kind of healthy and i don't have a lot

807.12 --> 809.86
of side

807.76 --> 811.12
issues so

809.86 --> 814.16
[Music]

811.12 --> 816.9590000000001
yeah i feel great but yeah i'm also a

814.16 --> 820.56
little mellowed out i think

816.959 --> 820.56
so i just feel really chill

821.279 --> 827.36
and yeah i'm up for yeah whatever any

824.48 --> 831.36
discussion any

827.36 --> 832.16
review yeah good servant gave me like a

831.36 --> 834.0
review

832.16 --> 835.199
of yesterday's show because he didn't

834.0 --> 836.959
see it

835.199 --> 842.16
like it never came up in his

836.959 --> 845.92
notifications until it was over

842.16 --> 848.56
but i really did appreciate his feedback

845.92 --> 849.76
and we had a lot of skype discussion

848.56 --> 857.4399999999999
like yesterday and

849.76 --> 860.56
and this morning even

857.44 --> 863.2790000000001
guess about what yeah about christ and

860.56 --> 865.199
about demons what are they and how

863.279 --> 870.68
should you regard them and

865.199 --> 873.9
yeah heavy stuff

870.68 --> 873.9
[Music]

879.68 --> 882.8389999999999
you know it's always weird with

881.12 --> 886.5600000000001
halloween in me

882.839 --> 888.48
because it i kind of remember

886.56 --> 890.0
like every year this happens like during

888.48 --> 891.1990000000001
the time when i realized okay it's

890.0 --> 894.639
halloween

891.199 --> 898.16
i somehow mellow out really well

894.639 --> 899.839
like i become really like at ease

898.16 --> 902.399
while everybody else seems to get all

899.839 --> 904.8800000000001
like oh overexcited and

902.399 --> 906.079
nervous and even get into arguments with

904.88 --> 908.639
one another because it's

906.079 --> 910.0
the tension and i'm like i don't know i

908.639 --> 913.04
mellow out

910.0 --> 913.519
is that freaky but it happens every year

913.04 --> 916.639
and i

913.519 --> 918.88
don't expect it to happen and so

916.639 --> 921.12
usually when it happens i just ride

918.88 --> 927.8389999999999
through it without

921.12 --> 927.839
anything eventful almost boring

928.0 --> 931.199
although usually the time before that i

930.88 --> 934.399
do

931.199 --> 934.399
build some tension

934.959 --> 938.56
i guess i pick up on the building

936.8 --> 940.639
tension with everybody else out there in

938.56 --> 943.5189999999999
the world especially through

940.639 --> 943.519
internet worlds

944.639 --> 949.199
but usually during it's just i'm all

946.959 --> 955.8389999999999
mellowed out

949.199 --> 955.8389999999999
weird isn't it

964.73 --> 969.839
[Music]

966.839 --> 969.839
anyway

974.16 --> 978.399
are any of you by your own volition or

977.92 --> 979.92
through

978.399 --> 984.16
i don't know your kids or something

979.92 --> 986.88
involved with some halloween activities

984.16 --> 997.8389999999999
anybody trick-or-treating or some

986.88 --> 997.8389999999999
special dress-up party or anything

999.68 --> 1004.959
or that that should have been

1002.88 --> 1006.959
for for the united states it should be

1004.959 --> 1008.959
now like at the end of that right it's

1006.959 --> 1014.079
in the early morning

1008.959 --> 1014.079
after halloween i don't know

1019.68 --> 1024.72
maybe everybody is now mellowed out

1022.0 --> 1029.52
because of all the candy

1024.72 --> 1034.0
it's just just sick of the sugar now

1029.52 --> 1036.959
i don't know any holidays okay

1034.0 --> 1038.0
sure i don't celebrate it either but

1036.959 --> 1041.3600000000001
it's still happening

1038.0 --> 1041.36
you know out there

1047.039 --> 1051.039
and over here you know it's not as

1048.88 --> 1052.4
widespread as in the united states for

1051.039 --> 1055.52
example but there's still

1052.4 --> 1057.6000000000001
plenty of people around that go all i

1055.52 --> 1060.32
don't know

1057.6 --> 1061.6
all theatrically crazy with their house

1060.32 --> 1062.8799999999999
and [ __ ]

1061.6 --> 1064.559
like they got all these little

1062.88 --> 1066.0
miniatures and they have it for

1064.559 --> 1069.28
halloween and they have it for

1066.0 --> 1070.88
christmas and sometimes for santa claus

1069.28 --> 1071.76
but usually mostly halloween and

1070.88 --> 1075.5200000000002
christmas

1071.76 --> 1075.52
so we have them over here as well

1076.64 --> 1080.7990000000002
especially during christmas there are

1078.16 --> 1083.3600000000001
some places in my newspaper cycle

1080.799 --> 1084.72
where i just really like have to keep my

1083.36 --> 1087.9189999999999
eyes closed because they've got

1084.72 --> 1090.559
so many flashing lights it just ah

1087.919 --> 1091.1200000000001
oh my god they're they're trying to

1090.559 --> 1094.48
attack

1091.12 --> 1094.4799999999998
people with epilepsy

1097.679 --> 1100.96
yeah but i i wouldn't do that to my own

1099.919 --> 1103.6000000000001
house

1100.96 --> 1104.64
although i did like even back in the day

1103.6 --> 1108.1599999999999
in my

1104.64 --> 1108.96
old house with my parents we did like

1108.16 --> 1111.44
put like

1108.96 --> 1112.24
a christmas tree and then just like a

1111.44 --> 1115.919
little

1112.24 --> 1116.799
jesus stable and all that i did always

1115.919 --> 1119.919
find that

1116.799 --> 1122.32
kind of interesting but

1119.919 --> 1125.1200000000001
not so flashy and not so much about

1122.32 --> 1125.12
santa claus

1131.52 --> 1137.84
or as we kind of call him

1134.88 --> 1137.8400000000001
christmas man

1139.28 --> 1146.16
yeah the kirsten

1142.64 --> 1148.3200000000002
kerst is christmas man mom man

1146.16 --> 1149.76
so yeah it's christmas man that's how we

1148.32 --> 1152.24
call him

1149.76 --> 1152.24
in dutch

1158.72 --> 1163.3600000000001
but yeah in the netherlands it was

1160.32 --> 1165.9189999999999
culturally always very compartmentalized

1163.36 --> 1168.559
for a long time at least throughout the

1165.919 --> 1170.96
entire 20th century

1168.559 --> 1171.9189999999999
that in the netherlands we did the

1170.96 --> 1176.0
package

1171.919 --> 1176.0
thing and all the silly stories about

1176.24 --> 1180.08
saint nicholas riding his horse over the

1179.2 --> 1182.72
rooftops

1180.08 --> 1184.72
and then dropping presents through the

1182.72 --> 1188.4
chimney using his

1184.72 --> 1191.1200000000001
black petes uh yeah

1188.4 --> 1192.0
basically his servants which happen to

1191.12 --> 1193.6
be very black

1192.0 --> 1195.12
and they were extra black because they

1193.6 --> 1196.3999999999999
go through the chimneys that was kind of

1195.12 --> 1198.7199999999998
the idea

1196.4 --> 1200.0
it's it's become very convoluted since

1198.72 --> 1202.72
then

1200.0 --> 1204.08
but we did it on our on our fifth of

1202.72 --> 1206.48
december

1204.08 --> 1208.559
and then yeah the united states and all

1206.48 --> 1209.84
wherever in harry potter land they all

1208.559 --> 1213.9189999999999
do it

1209.84 --> 1213.9189999999999
like during christmas

1214.48 --> 1217.679
and then in the netherlands we still

1216.159 --> 1220.159
might have a christmas tree and

1217.679 --> 1220.799
definitely out there christmas trees are

1220.159 --> 1222.64
like

1220.799 --> 1224.6399999999999
typical christmas decorations are

1222.64 --> 1227.3600000000001
installed

1224.64 --> 1228.64
also like on street lights and all that

1227.36 --> 1232.24
but other than that

1228.64 --> 1235.6000000000001
yeah it doesn't go it's not that focused

1232.24 --> 1237.6
on it it's mostly just about okay having

1235.6 --> 1240.1589999999999
a christmas tree maybe having special

1237.6 --> 1249.84
cookies for on the christmas tree

1240.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
and that's pretty much it

1250.81 --> 1253.97
[Music]

1256.24 --> 1259.52
although i've seen other dutch people

1258.08 --> 1262.6399999999999
that also like

1259.52 --> 1264.96
don't celebrate saint nicholas

1262.64 --> 1265.919
and then yeah do that sort of thing on

1264.96 --> 1268.799
christmas

1265.919 --> 1271.919
so it's yeah it's always been a bit all

1268.799 --> 1271.9189999999999
over the place i guess

1272.159 --> 1280.5590000000002
or it's become like that at least

1276.4 --> 1280.5590000000002
all right okay anyway what

1282.29 --> 1291.24
[Music]

1284.559 --> 1294.6399999999999
tommy robinson is oh well

1291.24 --> 1296.4
[Music]

1294.64 --> 1298.72
yeah that i don't know that can mean

1296.4 --> 1298.72
anything

1300.96 --> 1304.159
but he does typically drag around a lot

1303.36 --> 1306.559
of hassle

1304.159 --> 1306.5590000000002
within

1307.2 --> 1319.919
antifa people coming after him and [ __ ]

1318.24 --> 1322.4
and the government doesn't really like

1319.919 --> 1322.4
him either

1326.08 --> 1329.6
who that what's his gig well he's kind

1329.12 --> 1333.36
of

1329.6 --> 1334.799
sort of part of the alex jones level

1333.36 --> 1336.799
crowd he has been

1334.799 --> 1338.48
for some time but he yeah there's he's

1336.799 --> 1339.76
got some history man he's went to jail

1338.48 --> 1343.039
and [ __ ]

1339.76 --> 1346.24
because he tried to speak out against

1343.039 --> 1350.0
like yeah as he says it

1346.24 --> 1352.32
muslim pedophile grooming rings

1350.0 --> 1353.039
that he just noticed doing that sort of

1352.32 --> 1355.4399999999998
thing and he

1353.039 --> 1357.76
he really spoke out and got into huge

1355.44 --> 1360.72
trouble with that

1357.76 --> 1363.919
but he's totally like like full-on

1360.72 --> 1366.64
anti-muslim like that

1363.919 --> 1367.919
and yeah i don't think he's ever gonna

1366.64 --> 1370.24
be dissuaded

1367.919 --> 1372.3200000000002
from seeing it slightly different not

1370.24 --> 1374.559
the liberal different but just like

1372.32 --> 1375.84
okay you have muslims that actually

1374.559 --> 1377.6789999999999
behave

1375.84 --> 1379.52
more like christians and then have their

1377.679 --> 1381.52
own traditions and then you have the

1379.52 --> 1384.6399999999999
freaking maniacs

1381.52 --> 1389.12
basically hiding in their religion doing

1384.64 --> 1391.5200000000002
all the nasty [ __ ] the pharisees

1389.12 --> 1393.6
now i don't know if he actually sees it

1391.52 --> 1396.32
like that

1393.6 --> 1396.6399999999999
i haven't listened to him for a while

1396.32 --> 1398.799
but

1396.64 --> 1400.0
yeah he's always getting into a lot of

1398.799 --> 1402.6399999999999
hassle and

1400.0 --> 1403.52
being called nazi and racist and now

1402.64 --> 1406.72
that of course

1403.52 --> 1406.72
he's not that

1406.799 --> 1411.28
but i don't know i sometimes i get the

1408.559 --> 1412.96
feeling that he does push it a bit

1411.28 --> 1417.76
but he's just this i don't know he's

1412.96 --> 1420.0
just he is kind of a head strong guy so

1417.76 --> 1422.0
i don't know i always had sympathetic

1420.0 --> 1424.96
feelings towards him

1422.0 --> 1428.4
never thought he was like a really bad

1424.96 --> 1428.4
dude secretly or anything

1429.44 --> 1431.8400000000001
but yeah

1432.96 --> 1436.96
i think he's gotten trapped in some

1435.2 --> 1440.72
convoluted [ __ ]

1436.96 --> 1442.32
some complicated stuff

1440.72 --> 1445.84
with the media and everything i don't

1442.32 --> 1445.84
know man

1449.76 --> 1458.559
fear now eve racist oh so racist

1452.96 --> 1462.32
really he's a racist

1458.559 --> 1462.32
can't believe i'm hearing this from you

1464.96 --> 1473.8400000000001
how does that make him a racist

1479.6 --> 1486.9599999999998
but yeah he is interfere he is

1483.52 --> 1489.76
that's just that's his puddle just like

1486.96 --> 1489.76
alex jones

1494.32 --> 1500.0
no george sanford no now if there was

1498.08 --> 1504.08
some possibility of actual

1500.0 --> 1506.799
racism i'd be damn well telling you

1504.08 --> 1508.24
probably in giggling fashion because

1506.799 --> 1515.84
that stood out to me no

1508.24 --> 1515.84
this guy is not a racist it's ridiculous

1516.24 --> 1522.559
he might have some like fear

1519.679 --> 1523.52
in that sense like i just like kind of i

1522.559 --> 1525.6789999999999
used to have with

1523.52 --> 1526.96
well with black people when i was much

1525.679 --> 1530.0800000000002
younger i i

1526.96 --> 1532.88
like had fear responses sometimes just

1530.08 --> 1533.84
didn't get it didn't get the frequency

1532.88 --> 1537.3600000000001
and [ __ ]

1533.84 --> 1539.4399999999998
but that yeah i've gotten that's changed

1537.36 --> 1541.6789999999999
i've changed a lot

1539.44 --> 1543.76
so i don't have he may still have some

1541.679 --> 1545.2
of those types of responses so he gets

1543.76 --> 1548.24
really

1545.2 --> 1549.8400000000001
like defensive viscerally because he's

1548.24 --> 1550.64
kind of scared but that doesn't mean

1549.84 --> 1554.3999999999999
that he's like

1550.64 --> 1557.76
looking down on others or

1554.4 --> 1560.88
like treating them like lesser beings

1557.76 --> 1564.559
which is what racism really is okay

1560.88 --> 1566.3200000000002
so again it's just the word racism as

1564.559 --> 1570.96
you just applied it is

1566.32 --> 1573.039
massively convoluted politicized and

1570.96 --> 1575.039
yeah that kind of disappoints me hearing

1573.039 --> 1578.72
you use it like that

1575.039 --> 1582.48
it's just uh maybe i'm looking a little

1578.72 --> 1582.48
bit too much into it but it's just that

1582.799 --> 1586.1589999999999
i didn't even mention anything about a

1584.64 --> 1588.48
race

1586.159 --> 1590.0800000000002
all i said was muslims and yeah that

1588.48 --> 1594.32
doesn't make you a racist because

1590.08 --> 1598.0
muslim is not a race it's dumb

1594.32 --> 1600.6399999999999
to say that but whatever hey neil

1598.0 --> 1600.64
good to see you

1607.279 --> 1610.24
okay but he's

1610.64 --> 1616.159
at speaker's corner okay yeah that might

1613.84 --> 1617.9189999999999
be interesting

1616.159 --> 1620.88
wonder if there's gonna be some flat

1617.919 --> 1620.88
earth is there too

1623.44 --> 1627.8400000000001
i don't know

1638.399 --> 1644.2399999999998
right yeah also by the way

1641.52 --> 1644.799
george sanford about that whole fear

1644.24 --> 1648.159
sells

1644.799 --> 1652.1589999999999
and is addictive yeah that

1648.159 --> 1655.5200000000002
might be true but that doesn't mean that

1652.159 --> 1658.0800000000002
the person is selling fear

1655.52 --> 1660.799
like some devil trying to make everybody

1658.08 --> 1663.6789999999999
afraid knowing that

1660.799 --> 1665.679
no i'm pretty sure that the fear he's

1663.679 --> 1667.8400000000001
selling he believes in

1665.679 --> 1671.039
so he is literally trying to defend

1667.84 --> 1674.72
humanity against his perceived threat

1671.039 --> 1676.96
right and yeah in my own way that's what

1674.72 --> 1679.039
i'm doing as well and learning a lot and

1676.96 --> 1681.44
figuring out yeah so much of it is

1679.039 --> 1682.1589999999999
illusion how do you deal with this it's

1681.44 --> 1684.48
a very

1682.159 --> 1686.72
complicated thing and he's already

1684.48 --> 1688.64
pulled into media so deeply

1686.72 --> 1690.88
it becomes even more complicated that

1688.64 --> 1690.88
way

1691.12 --> 1699.36
because he's becoming part of projects

1696.399 --> 1699.9189999999999
that are tying into those specific

1699.36 --> 1702.24
approach

1699.919 --> 1703.679
levels as it were and that makes it very

1702.24 --> 1707.36
difficult to maneuver

1703.679 --> 1707.3600000000001
from that point on with yourself

1708.24 --> 1712.88
like but i don't know

1723.44 --> 1729.44
all right nils yeah well i had some

1726.0 --> 1732.08
really weird experiences with that too

1729.44 --> 1733.039
because there were times where i would

1732.08 --> 1734.72
basically be

1733.039 --> 1736.64
somewhere like at a swimming pool or

1734.72 --> 1739.44
whatever and like

1736.64 --> 1740.72
i remember this one time and it happened

1739.44 --> 1743.52
other times too where

1740.72 --> 1745.52
i think i was like 12 or something maybe

1743.52 --> 1747.84
younger

1745.52 --> 1749.6
and there would be like this really

1747.84 --> 1753.1999999999998
really black lady and like

1749.6 --> 1755.84
two of her kids and

1753.2 --> 1756.88
like i was basically trying to be social

1755.84 --> 1759.9189999999999
and they would like

1756.88 --> 1762.5590000000002
really like be

1759.919 --> 1762.96
push me like really like get away from

1762.559 --> 1766.1589999999999
me

1762.96 --> 1767.52
you dirty white person it's like what

1766.159 --> 1770.96
the [ __ ]

1767.52 --> 1773.279
and that was like in the 20th century

1770.96 --> 1774.32
right that wasn't like yeah if that

1773.279 --> 1778.32
would happen maybe

1774.32 --> 1780.48
now the last five or ten years okay

1778.32 --> 1782.0
but back then i was like shocked like

1780.48 --> 1785.039
what the [ __ ]

1782.0 --> 1785.44
like i'm i'm literally trying like even

1785.039 --> 1788.0
not

1785.44 --> 1789.1200000000001
trying to be nice as a virtue signal but

1788.0 --> 1792.64
because i just

1789.12 --> 1795.6789999999999
i wanna understand you

1792.64 --> 1798.64
you know this is so that was quite

1795.679 --> 1798.64
shocking at the time

1804.64 --> 1808.24
but yeah i've never went yeah i never

1806.64 --> 1808.7990000000002
went to schools where there were black

1808.24 --> 1812.08
people

1808.799 --> 1815.279
oh oh no white privilege

1812.08 --> 1818.6399999999999
i don't know it's just there weren't any

1815.279 --> 1820.559
and all of it was kind of a web away

1818.64 --> 1824.159
from bigger cities

1820.559 --> 1827.039
so it was more like i guess more rural

1824.159 --> 1828.72
type schools and there just weren't any

1827.039 --> 1831.84
black people

1828.72 --> 1832.3990000000001
and only later on the school there were

1831.84 --> 1835.84
a couple

1832.399 --> 1837.84
it just i don't know black folks didn't

1835.84 --> 1840.48
send their kids there

1837.84 --> 1843.12
for some reason or they didn't know the

1840.48 --> 1846.799
school even existed

1843.12 --> 1851.84
or some but yeah i don't know

1846.799 --> 1851.84
probably completely different now

1859.6 --> 1866.559
maybe it's just that anthroposophy

1863.519 --> 1868.0
which was like that school type and it's

1866.559 --> 1871.84
like based on like

1868.0 --> 1872.72
german sort of christian spirituality

1871.84 --> 1875.039
thing

1872.72 --> 1875.919
maybe that just really doesn't appeal to

1875.039 --> 1878.32
black people

1875.919 --> 1879.44
maybe maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm just

1878.32 --> 1882.8799999999999
completely

1879.44 --> 1882.88
wrong i don't know what that was

1889.44 --> 1893.8400000000001
i just never noticed any

1897.6 --> 1902.559
i do know though that i remember like

1901.039 --> 1906.399
especially in my teens

1902.559 --> 1906.8799999999999
which was after that because that's cool

1906.399 --> 1908.6399999999999
and i

1906.88 --> 1910.24
i just mentioned it's mostly like up

1908.64 --> 1912.72
until 12.

1910.24 --> 1915.279
after that i did notice there was just a

1912.72 --> 1918.559
lot of attention on news and

1915.279 --> 1920.399
through liberal things like

1918.559 --> 1921.6789999999999
do you have to get blacks in the schools

1920.399 --> 1924.399
you have like no more

1921.679 --> 1925.919
white only schools like oh my god it's

1924.399 --> 1932.08
such a problem

1925.919 --> 1932.0800000000002
oh that that started to get pushed i

1932.84 --> 1935.84
noticed

1940.799 --> 1945.039
like i don't know like they wouldn't

1943.279 --> 1947.12
allow in

1945.039 --> 1948.08
black people like does that really

1947.12 --> 1951.36
happen

1948.08 --> 1951.36
did that ever happen

1955.519 --> 1961.36
or is it just been yeah i'm not

1959.039 --> 1962.8799999999999
yeah i'm speculating here but maybe i

1961.36 --> 1963.279
don't know how that even happened like

1962.88 --> 1965.3600000000001
did

1963.279 --> 1967.76
did any of those schools that were white

1965.36 --> 1971.12
only ever refuse a black person

1967.76 --> 1971.919
ever or was it simply black people

1971.12 --> 1973.76
didn't feel

1971.919 --> 1975.3600000000001
welcome because there were so little

1973.76 --> 1978.48
black people

1975.36 --> 1980.0
and they just complained about it which

1978.48 --> 1984.0
is

1980.0 --> 1985.2
just annoying may i don't know how that

1984.0 --> 1988.24
even really happened

1985.2 --> 1991.44
or if it would just literally liberal

1988.24 --> 1992.3990000000001
pushing through media and politics i

1991.44 --> 1994.3990000000001
don't know

1992.399 --> 1996.08
i wasn't paying too much attention to

1994.399 --> 1997.6789999999999
all that back then

1996.08 --> 2004.99
just noticed that it was getting pushed

1997.679 --> 2010.95
a lot

2004.99 --> 2010.95
[Music]

2013.44 --> 2019.8400000000001
also after i became christian racism and

2016.399 --> 2019.84
language just changed

2025.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
all right okay

2036.559 --> 2041.519
i guess that like becoming a christian

2040.64 --> 2043.3600000000001
can

2041.519 --> 2046.0
just make you a little bit more serious

2043.36 --> 2049.2799999999997
and just give you a broader look on

2046.0 --> 2052.159
what it actually is like you you become

2049.28 --> 2054.159
a little bit more serious

2052.159 --> 2057.52
and i guess that it will typically

2054.159 --> 2061.52
change your views and all that

2057.52 --> 2063.2
for me it wasn't that i i had that sort

2061.52 --> 2066.8
of like a

2063.2 --> 2069.52
personal conviction i guess based on

2066.8 --> 2073.04
frequency and my conception of god

2069.52 --> 2075.28
on my own without being a christian

2073.04 --> 2077.2
although every time i heard jesus i was

2075.28 --> 2079.44
like yeah yeah

2077.2 --> 2079.4399999999996
cool

2080.48 --> 2083.679
i never really had a problem with jesus

2083.28 --> 2086.8390000000004
i

2083.679 --> 2088.399
unfortunately got caught up between

2086.839 --> 2091.52
people

2088.399 --> 2093.44
not too great like being virtue

2091.52 --> 2095.119
signaling against christ that's

2093.44 --> 2097.52
basically what that was and i'm like

2095.119 --> 2099.359
really embarrassed by that now

2097.52 --> 2100.72
because there was very popular if you

2099.359 --> 2106.48
said something it's so

2100.72 --> 2106.48
so embarrassing now so embarrassing

2109.68 --> 2116.8799999999997
it makes me feel so cheap remembering

2112.16 --> 2120.96
that i did that [ __ ]

2116.88 --> 2124.0
ugh i know

2120.96 --> 2127.04
yeah it was ignorant

2124.0 --> 2128.56
but it was also just cheap because i

2127.04 --> 2132.24
didn't really mean it

2128.56 --> 2134.88
i was just trying to be popular

2132.24 --> 2137.2
i wanted to be seen as more cool more

2134.88 --> 2140.4
resilient or whatever you know that

2137.2 --> 2140.3999999999996
more hardcore and

2141.52 --> 2145.44
it makes me shiver thinking that to be

2144.16 --> 2148.96
like that now

2145.44 --> 2148.96
so glad i got over that

2150.0 --> 2153.44
i deal with all that differently because

2151.76 --> 2155.119
hey i still kind of do want to be

2153.44 --> 2157.92
popular i want to be liked

2155.119 --> 2159.119
that never really changed i'm just not

2157.92 --> 2162.56
being a complete

2159.119 --> 2162.56
dumbass with it now

2164.72 --> 2173.839
hey nathan oakley

2182.32 --> 2189.119
hey man there you

2186.56 --> 2189.119
cutie

2196.96 --> 2200.7200000000003
all right in the workings of the holy

2199.92 --> 2202.88
spirit

2200.72 --> 2205.2
and that's funny because even before i

2202.88 --> 2207.599
really understood

2205.2 --> 2208.3999999999996
the yeah the christian picture and of

2207.599 --> 2211.52
the

2208.4 --> 2214.0
mistakes and learning from them

2211.52 --> 2214.64
before i really started to grab onto

2214.0 --> 2218.8
that and

2214.64 --> 2222.4
trying to master dealing with it

2218.8 --> 2224.8
before that i kind of like latched on

2222.4 --> 2226.32
top to the idea of the holy spirit

2224.8 --> 2228.4
myself

2226.32 --> 2230.32
i tried to deal with that because it's

2228.4 --> 2232.48
like yeah the intangible thing that's

2230.32 --> 2233.76
out there that's basically responding

2232.48 --> 2237.92
and

2233.76 --> 2240.0
now i conceive it sort of similar but

2237.92 --> 2243.839
different because now i just see it as

2240.0 --> 2247.359
like this inherent

2243.839 --> 2247.839
other side of creation it so i guess it

2247.359 --> 2250.0789999999997
is the

2247.839 --> 2251.119
holy spirit it's like it's because of

2250.079 --> 2254.0
creation

2251.119 --> 2256.7200000000003
but i don't see this physical world as

2254.0 --> 2259.28
kind of the primary

2256.72 --> 2261.2
source it's like this is the manifest

2259.28 --> 2265.76
this is the physical realm the

2261.2 --> 2269.7599999999998
emulation for

2265.76 --> 2271.8390000000004
god i think that the physical realm is

2269.76 --> 2274.4
basically simulatory

2271.839 --> 2276.72
in nature because it's not a simulation

2274.4 --> 2277.04
in a computer made to look real it is

2276.72 --> 2280.0789999999997
real

2277.04 --> 2284.079
it's physical it's just that this real

2280.079 --> 2287.119
physicality in my designer's opinion

2284.079 --> 2288.6400000000003
is most likely to be simulatory in

2287.119 --> 2292.0
nature as in

2288.64 --> 2295.2799999999997
it was created as if thing f

2292.0 --> 2299.839
as if it is a simulation out of nothing

2295.28 --> 2302.2400000000002
that's part of yeah how i conceive it

2299.839 --> 2303.52
i might be incorrect about elements of

2302.24 --> 2307.04
that

2303.52 --> 2313.119
but i still think yeah i've been saying

2307.04 --> 2316.16
that for some time

2313.119 --> 2327.839
yeah i just think of it like that

2316.16 --> 2327.839
but maybe i'm wrong i don't know

2333.28 --> 2341.6800000000003
convicts us oh you mean he goes around

2337.76 --> 2343.76
and basic really

2341.68 --> 2346.48
convict us because yeah i have

2343.76 --> 2349.3590000000004
experienced that

2346.48 --> 2351.68
like through my dark world experience it

2349.359 --> 2355.2
to me it was like i was facing

2351.68 --> 2358.96
god or but it was just

2355.2 --> 2361.2799999999997
really punishment it was like the weird

2358.96 --> 2364.32
spirit quartz or something

2361.28 --> 2366.48
and just for my stupid

2364.32 --> 2368.48
for my arrogance yeah because i have a

2366.48 --> 2370.32
lot of

2368.48 --> 2372.32
i've had a lot of issues and really

2370.32 --> 2376.1600000000003
stupid mistakes and

2372.32 --> 2379.6800000000003
just doubling down on yeah tenacious

2376.16 --> 2382.24
earthly convictions and [ __ ]

2379.68 --> 2384.16
and i like literally remember it's

2382.24 --> 2385.1189999999997
almost like yeah god faces you and says

2384.16 --> 2388.48
like

2385.119 --> 2391.599
he punishes you he basically like this

2388.48 --> 2394.2400000000002
is this is it

2391.599 --> 2397.2000000000003
but then scares the [ __ ] out of me when

2394.24 --> 2399.2
that happens

2397.2 --> 2400.3199999999997
almost like in the physical world

2399.2 --> 2403.2
without the dream

2400.32 --> 2405.599
extra lay on the dark world that would

2403.2 --> 2408.16
also happen it's like this realization

2405.599 --> 2410.0
shock and in the dark world that

2408.16 --> 2412.72
reflected as if you suddenly

2410.0 --> 2413.359
are met by god who's making like a

2412.72 --> 2417.04
judgment

2413.359 --> 2418.64
over you and yeah that's happened a

2417.04 --> 2421.839
couple of times

2418.64 --> 2422.16
but it seems like every time he does

2421.839 --> 2426.0
that

2422.16 --> 2429.68
he's basically laying out the punishment

2426.0 --> 2432.8
for that mistake for as long as it goes

2429.68 --> 2436.0
because i figured out that with certain

2432.8 --> 2436.7200000000003
judgment calls i've been able to redeem

2436.0 --> 2439.76
them

2436.72 --> 2445.04
by basically

2439.76 --> 2448.0
building around the mistake and then

2445.04 --> 2449.2799999999997
yeah ensuring that i learned every

2448.0 --> 2452.319
possible thing about

2449.28 --> 2454.48
it to truly master it and then the

2452.319 --> 2456.16
punishment kind of goes away

2454.48 --> 2458.319
because i used to have a lot more

2456.16 --> 2458.8799999999997
punishment going around and hey just

2458.319 --> 2462.16
look uh

2458.88 --> 2463.119
five years ago compare that to how i am

2462.16 --> 2464.8799999999997
right now just

2463.119 --> 2467.44
the way i look out of my eyes the way

2464.88 --> 2468.56
everything and you'll see the stark

2467.44 --> 2470.64
difference

2468.56 --> 2472.24
and it's not just because i'm more used

2470.64 --> 2474.0789999999997
to doing this

2472.24 --> 2475.7599999999998
it's because there's just been things

2474.079 --> 2481.8390000000004
that have

2475.76 --> 2481.8390000000004
punishment that has dropped away

2483.599 --> 2490.7200000000003
the ethereal world what it depends on

2486.24 --> 2490.72
what you conceive of the ethereal world

2492.839 --> 2497.599
it's

2494.96 --> 2500.64
i've interacted with what i basically

2497.599 --> 2504.4
call the dark world

2500.64 --> 2505.44
because yeah because it was usually very

2504.4 --> 2507.6800000000003
dark

2505.44 --> 2509.28
i never saw any celestial lights in the

2507.68 --> 2511.5989999999997
dark world

2509.28 --> 2515.2000000000003
unless it was something else unless it

2511.599 --> 2515.2000000000003
was literally a memory moment

2515.92 --> 2519.2000000000003
but as it were the in-between world for

2518.4 --> 2522.7200000000003
me

2519.2 --> 2526.8799999999997
which i've been calling the dark world

2522.72 --> 2531.1189999999997
just seem to have i don't know

2526.88 --> 2532.7200000000003
like virtual simulated representations

2531.119 --> 2536.48
like a holodeck

2532.72 --> 2539.359
of imagination conceptions including

2536.48 --> 2540.16
interaction with i guess spirit entities

2539.359 --> 2543.119
and [ __ ] it's

2540.16 --> 2543.1189999999997
very bizarre

2543.359 --> 2550.56
very bizarre place at times

2547.44 --> 2552.8
but it also can be just

2550.56 --> 2555.2
you can close off outside influences and

2552.8 --> 2558.88
then it's really

2555.2 --> 2561.4399999999996
like very much like a dream

2558.88 --> 2561.92
if you have like lucid dreams it's it's

2561.44 --> 2565.359
very

2561.92 --> 2569.599
much like that except you're really

2565.359 --> 2572.24
cut stuck stuck in there and

2569.599 --> 2574.319
you have just so much more grips so it's

2572.24 --> 2576.24
like really an emulation

2574.319 --> 2578.4
it's like a little miniature holodeck

2576.24 --> 2580.9599999999996
simulation in your head

2578.4 --> 2582.8
of your inner world it's quite

2580.96 --> 2584.8
fascinating how it works

2582.8 --> 2586.2400000000002
but it might also depend on your

2584.8 --> 2590.4
personal

2586.24 --> 2593.7599999999998
i guess skill brain range

2590.4 --> 2596.319
i think how well it works has to do with

2593.76 --> 2598.88
how much capacity you have

2596.319 --> 2601.2799999999997
in your mind in order to sustain that

2598.88 --> 2603.28
specific type of emulation process and i

2601.28 --> 2604.5600000000004
think that my brain for some reason

2603.28 --> 2606.4
because i have this massive

2604.56 --> 2612.0789999999997
visualization capacity

2606.4 --> 2621.839
unusual that it works really well for me

2612.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
that's my conclusion

2622.8 --> 2626.1600000000003
and it definitely also has to do with

2624.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
the pineal gland

2626.16 --> 2635.839
but not exclusively

2639.44 --> 2643.839
no i've not tried dmt and i don't i

2643.359 --> 2649.839
don't

2643.839 --> 2653.359
i haven't tried any hallucinogenics

2649.839 --> 2655.599
like ever one time

2653.359 --> 2658.0789999999997
the one time i did it was the wild move

2655.599 --> 2659.839
when i was freaking 15

2658.079 --> 2662.6400000000003
and that was kind of a nice experience

2659.839 --> 2663.68
never never tried anything serious after

2662.64 --> 2666.7999999999997
that

2663.68 --> 2669.2799999999997
i guess the worst event was like absent

2666.8 --> 2670.319
at some pretty bizarre little dream

2669.28 --> 2672.88
hallucinations

2670.319 --> 2673.92
life where you literally just see like a

2672.88 --> 2676.96
movie

2673.92 --> 2679.359
it's just like a movie it's just like oh

2676.96 --> 2680.0
this terror happens in reality and

2679.359 --> 2682.56
certainly

2680.0 --> 2683.76
i see in another time in the same place

2682.56 --> 2687.2799999999997
i've seen that [ __ ] that

2683.76 --> 2690.96
was weird but other than that

2687.28 --> 2692.88
nah i don't know my my dreams

2690.96 --> 2694.56
and my dark world experiences which seem

2692.88 --> 2696.7200000000003
to be just tied in with

2694.56 --> 2697.839
my regular being i said i find them the

2696.72 --> 2701.04
weirdest and i i

2697.839 --> 2703.7599999999998
don't really do anything to

2701.04 --> 2705.359
don't take anything for that and the

2703.76 --> 2708.5600000000004
times that it did happen

2705.359 --> 2711.119
i didn't even know what it was and it

2708.56 --> 2712.16
even felt kind of forced on me at times

2711.119 --> 2714.48
it was just

2712.16 --> 2717.5989999999997
i was not much in control of myself when

2714.48 --> 2722.16
that happened during that time

2717.599 --> 2722.1600000000003
never sought it out really

2722.56 --> 2728.4
like really sorted out like wanting to

2725.76 --> 2730.7200000000003
actually know what it is how you do that

2728.4 --> 2733.28
and then make decisions i've never

2730.72 --> 2736.0
actually even done that it was that

2733.28 --> 2736.0
freaky to me

2736.079 --> 2740.48
even though i've yeah since learned that

2738.079 --> 2745.76
well technically

2740.48 --> 2748.079
there is that you can make that like

2745.76 --> 2749.599
in the smart shop they actually have

2748.079 --> 2752.2400000000002
that

2749.599 --> 2753.6800000000003
the cacti and you they can even teach

2752.24 --> 2757.04
you how to make it

2753.68 --> 2761.839
so i could do it i just don't

2757.04 --> 2761.839
really wanna

2765.44 --> 2768.88
hey sleeping warrior no i've not read

2767.76 --> 2771.2000000000003
that

2768.88 --> 2771.2000000000003
because

2772.8 --> 2779.599
i don't read a lot cops oh

2776.079 --> 2779.599
god slash tires whoa

2781.44 --> 2789.839
okay that's crazy

2800.839 --> 2803.839
ugh

2804.72 --> 2810.0
oh my god oh they broke up a party

2813.28 --> 2819.119
yeah i don't know man british police are

2815.119 --> 2822.96
like being so idiotic with this

2819.119 --> 2822.96
covet situation ridiculous

2828.24 --> 2834.9599999999996
that's it not good that's

2831.52 --> 2834.96
not good i've never tried that

2835.599 --> 2839.2000000000003
not that i remember anyway

2841.839 --> 2845.68
maybe in the dark world i've tried

2843.52 --> 2849.68
everything because it's

2845.68 --> 2851.39
just an emulation but

2849.68 --> 2853.2799999999997
in the physical world no

2851.39 --> 2859.839
[Music]

2853.28 --> 2859.8390000000004
no thank you

2861.04 --> 2867.92
but yeah i yeah i did get like

2864.16 --> 2870.16
when i was 15 this i don't know minimum

2867.92 --> 2871.44
heat of acid i guess it wasn't even like

2870.16 --> 2874.5589999999997
a droplet in the sugar

2871.44 --> 2874.559
it was just this freaking

2874.8 --> 2878.96
little paper with some stuff on it

2881.28 --> 2887.28
but yeah that's 25 years ago and hey the

2884.24 --> 2891.2799999999997
it was just like oh nice colors

2887.28 --> 2891.28
that's it and i felt kind of happy

2891.44 --> 2899.28
that's it in retrospect having that

2896.4 --> 2900.48
once at least did feel like yeah that

2899.28 --> 2903.6800000000003
was

2900.48 --> 2906.4
that didn't feel nefarious at all

2903.68 --> 2908.5589999999997
but i can imagine that if you keep on

2906.4 --> 2910.7200000000003
taking that on a regular basis you might

2908.559 --> 2914.1600000000003
go insane

2910.72 --> 2928.0789999999997
i don't know never really went that far

2914.16 --> 2931.5989999999997
just with that one time so

2928.079 --> 2934.2400000000002
yeah which by the way i got from like

2931.599 --> 2935.2000000000003
pretty dubious people that i hung around

2934.24 --> 2938.5589999999997
with

2935.2 --> 2941.1189999999997
they were like uh they call them

2938.559 --> 2943.8390000000004
yeah they were they were actual gypsies

2941.119 --> 2943.839
in spain

2944.24 --> 2951.359
and they were like pretty

2947.28 --> 2954.3190000000004
yeah they were not very

2951.359 --> 2955.44
cool people well they were kind of like

2954.319 --> 2959.599
sort of soft

2955.44 --> 2961.44
level gangster types but

2959.599 --> 2963.2000000000003
i don't know i kind of hung around with

2961.44 --> 2971.599
them they didn't do anything

2963.2 --> 2973.2799999999997
super criminal or anything and i also

2971.599 --> 2975.44
got them out of trouble a couple of

2973.28 --> 2977.28
times because they were gonna go into a

2975.44 --> 2979.2000000000003
fight with some guys that apparently

2977.28 --> 2982.559
didn't like the looks of them

2979.2 --> 2985.7599999999998
and i thought like no

2982.559 --> 2988.079
let's not do that

2985.76 --> 2992.3190000000004
but yeah that also is man that's that's

2988.079 --> 2992.319
so long yeah that's 25 years ago

2992.88 --> 2998.48
but yeah they those guys had like this

2995.44 --> 3000.48
sticker thing with acid

2998.48 --> 3001.599
didn't even know what it was they could

3000.48 --> 3005.92
barely even speak

3001.599 --> 3009.04
english this was a wild situation for me

3005.92 --> 3010.7200000000003
but very exciting my parents did not

3009.04 --> 3013.839
know where the [ __ ] i was

3010.72 --> 3013.839
by the way

3016.8 --> 3020.079
they thought that was just going out

3018.319 --> 3023.2799999999997
with my regular

3020.079 --> 3026.7200000000003
camping friends anyway

3023.28 --> 3029.3590000000004
let's get back to sleeping war is

3026.72 --> 3029.359
talking about

3031.599 --> 3035.44
civil war is coming oh dear

3036.319 --> 3043.2
i i wouldn't call that civil war

3040.319 --> 3045.119
it's just at some point that yeah the

3043.2 --> 3048.8799999999997
regular people are gonna be

3045.119 --> 3052.079
so fed up with the cops

3048.88 --> 3052.96
doing that that people are literally

3052.079 --> 3057.8390000000004
gonna just

3052.96 --> 3057.839
start to bulk up and then just gang up

3058.079 --> 3062.079
what would you call that civil war i

3059.92 --> 3064.64
would just call that some very serious

3062.079 --> 3064.6400000000003
rioting

3064.8 --> 3069.44
maybe somewhat similar to what happened

3067.839 --> 3071.2799999999997
in the 80s

3069.44 --> 3073.52
in the netherlands something like that

3071.28 --> 3075.28
happened over here

3073.52 --> 3078.72
where yeah it was all there were like

3075.28 --> 3083.0400000000004
straight on police against public fights

3078.72 --> 3084.8799999999997
it had to do with like living space

3083.04 --> 3087.68
like people couldn't live anywhere at

3084.88 --> 3091.359
the time because of the policies

3087.68 --> 3094.16
and yeah something like that

3091.359 --> 3097.04
might happen i would not be surprised

3094.16 --> 3099.7599999999998
but you can't really call it a civil war

3097.04 --> 3099.7599999999998
just yet

3103.359 --> 3108.24
but yeah it could get pretty rough i

3105.44 --> 3112.079
agree sleeping warrior

3108.24 --> 3113.359
all right what is containing the

3112.079 --> 3118.1600000000003
atmosphere

3113.359 --> 3122.839
well for starters a limited volume

3118.16 --> 3125.359
and then yeah how does that limited

3122.839 --> 3127.599
volume

3125.359 --> 3128.96
yeah what basically causes the limited

3127.599 --> 3131.44
volume yeah that's

3128.96 --> 3133.68
kind of pretty open how that's gonna

3131.44 --> 3136.0
work because we don't know exactly how

3133.68 --> 3139.04
much the volume is

3136.0 --> 3140.64
just know it has to be limited must be

3139.04 --> 3143.04
or there could not be stable gas

3140.64 --> 3143.04
pressure

3143.119 --> 3147.599
would be continually changing and if it

3146.16 --> 3152.96
was vast then it would be

3147.599 --> 3156.559
very rapidly changing but

3152.96 --> 3156.559
yeah it could be all sorts of things

3157.04 --> 3165.359
it could be a physical structure

3161.119 --> 3167.76
it could simply be a barrier

3165.359 --> 3168.72
that is not even physical but is simply

3167.76 --> 3172.48
like the end

3168.72 --> 3175.7599999999998
to where material can move towards

3172.48 --> 3178.88
so it would be a cutoff point of

3175.76 --> 3182.1600000000003
physical access as it were

3178.88 --> 3184.0
so a barrier as to material can simply

3182.16 --> 3184.96
not move beyond it anymore it's just

3184.0 --> 3187.44
black

3184.96 --> 3188.96
that's it there is no more material

3187.44 --> 3192.0
space

3188.96 --> 3195.52
i've conceived it like that and yeah

3192.0 --> 3200.319
partially a loop within the realms

3195.52 --> 3202.079
space could be the limiter to the volume

3200.319 --> 3203.52
because then the gas would simply be

3202.079 --> 3209.8390000000004
pressing against itself

3203.52 --> 3209.839
in certain directions

3210.64 --> 3226.0
so yeah there you go

3223.119 --> 3226.559
okay uh yeah sleeping we're sure you can

3226.0 --> 3228.0
send me

3226.559 --> 3231.0400000000004
that letter i don't know if i'm gonna

3228.0 --> 3231.04
read all through it but

3234.559 --> 3239.3590000000004
okay what what about sleeping warrior

3236.88 --> 3239.359
what is it

3240.319 --> 3243.359
you want to come on the show want to

3241.839 --> 3245.68
talk about it you seem to be

3243.359 --> 3245.68
very

3248.0 --> 3251.839
filled up with this

3251.9 --> 3255.03
[Music]

3278.0 --> 3282.48
okay okay sleeping warrior but some hint

3281.28 --> 3284.88
look i'm not gonna just

3282.48 --> 3286.48
live read it out loud because i don't

3284.88 --> 3293.839
know what it is you're not really giving

3286.48 --> 3293.839
me any hint

3303.2 --> 3309.04
it's a letter wait

3306.72 --> 3310.24
how did somebody here we go yeah letter

3309.04 --> 3314.0
written by trump

3310.24 --> 3318.5589999999997
or to trump by bishop vigano i think i

3314.0 --> 3318.559
i read or heard that one that was a good

3318.839 --> 3321.839
one

3323.52 --> 3328.24
oh right okay so yeah yeah i've read

3326.24 --> 3330.9599999999996
i've seen it

3328.24 --> 3335.839
infowars did a article on that i did

3330.96 --> 3335.839
pick up on that

3339.52 --> 3347.52
well joseph 369

3344.319 --> 3349.04
i think the sun and celestial bodies are

3347.52 --> 3352.48
not anywhere they're not

3349.04 --> 3356.319
objects in any location they are only

3352.48 --> 3360.16
apparent like based phenomena

3356.319 --> 3363.839
that seem to have apparent locations

3360.16 --> 3367.04
in relation to the observer

3363.839 --> 3369.68
and wherever they might be

3367.04 --> 3370.88
so no the sun and the celestial bodies

3369.68 --> 3377.839
are nowhere

3370.88 --> 3377.839
they are not objects to be in a location

3379.45 --> 3382.5499999999997
[Music]

3384.48 --> 3388.079

3448.59 --> 3453.03
[Music]

3459.85 --> 3462.98
[Music]

3465.2 --> 3468.0
yeah i got tea

3468.24 --> 3471.839
also a little hungry by the way but

3471.2 --> 3475.839
still got

3471.839 --> 3475.839
a half an hour to go

3486.839 --> 3494.48
sugar and

3490.0 --> 3494.48
last time i had sugar my tea is

3496.64 --> 3506.799
i think 2006.

3503.839 --> 3508.64
oh god not more tea puns please i don't

3506.799 --> 3517.839
even know what it was about anymore but

3508.64 --> 3517.839
i don't care to remember

3521.28 --> 3528.559
oh god yeah the teacup now i remember

3524.559 --> 3528.559
oh good ugh whatever

3529.2 --> 3537.9199999999996
do i use a harvest syrup no

3533.44 --> 3537.92
no does that's not much better

3538.64 --> 3545.2799999999997
i've experienced that as actually worse

3540.96 --> 3548.96
but i did try it for some time at first

3545.28 --> 3552.2400000000002
but it yeah when i started to do that

3548.96 --> 3555.28
it would literally i would literally

3552.24 --> 3559.839
feel pain like it's like

3555.28 --> 3559.8390000000004
my uh

3560.0 --> 3563.68
why do you call that in english again

3562.799 --> 3566.48
the sugar

3563.68 --> 3567.5989999999997
processing organ as it were that it

3566.48 --> 3570.64
didn't like that

3567.599 --> 3570.96
at all so that was a clear indication

3570.64 --> 3572.8799999999997
like

3570.96 --> 3574.4
okay whatever they're gonna say about

3572.88 --> 3577.44
this

3574.4 --> 3580.4
that doesn't like it

3577.44 --> 3580.4
so no thanks

3582.16 --> 3586.0789999999997
it's like the because it it was for it's

3584.48 --> 3590.48
fructose mostly

3586.079 --> 3592.7200000000003
the that one you know

3590.48 --> 3594.559
and that's not much better it's actually

3592.72 --> 3596.72
more polluting when your body breaks it

3594.559 --> 3601.8390000000004
down

3596.72 --> 3601.839
honey honey is okay and he's different

3606.799 --> 3615.839
but i don't know i've never really been

3608.48 --> 3615.839
a fan of honey my tea

3618.64 --> 3622.72
no sleeping warrior now it's not another

3621.839 --> 3626.0789999999997
word for it

3622.72 --> 3627.1189999999997
but space-time conceptions from einstein

3626.079 --> 3631.2000000000003
he definitely

3627.119 --> 3635.2000000000003
used perspective

3631.2 --> 3638.96
as a i guess a formulaic

3635.2 --> 3642.24
guide for his conceptions of what

3638.96 --> 3644.48
space time would be like he definitely

3642.24 --> 3648.16
was inspired by the concept of

3644.48 --> 3652.559
perspective i would agree to that

3648.16 --> 3656.7799999999997
but yeah i wouldn't completely reify it

3652.559 --> 3660.2490000000003
yeah that would simply be incorrect

3656.78 --> 3660.2490000000003
[Music]

3669.04 --> 3675.04
like the honey well i do

3672.4 --> 3676.0
i like honey it's just it's not

3675.04 --> 3679.119
something i

3676.0 --> 3679.76
regularly take sometimes i'm just in a

3679.119 --> 3682.88
weird

3679.76 --> 3686.2400000000002
like rush-like mood for honey

3682.88 --> 3688.88
or hey if i if i have like

3686.24 --> 3690.4799999999996
cold symptom-like situations and i just

3688.88 --> 3692.7200000000003
have a rough throat then i might

3690.48 --> 3695.119
typically get some honey

3692.72 --> 3696.24
but it just very rarely take that i got

3695.119 --> 3699.839
a i got a

3696.24 --> 3703.04
pot of it though

3699.839 --> 3703.04
for when i feel like it

3704.319 --> 3710.0
but those usually last over a year or

3707.839 --> 3712.16
more

3710.0 --> 3713.359
so i i've just stepped away from kind of

3712.16 --> 3716.48
being used to

3713.359 --> 3718.0789999999997
sugar rushes of all sorts because i was

3716.48 --> 3721.28
really addicted to sugar

3718.079 --> 3723.3590000000004
back in the day and i

3721.28 --> 3727.44
really got that out of my system because

3723.359 --> 3729.839
it's dangerous to me

3727.44 --> 3731.599
okay thank you unicorn laser eyes for

3729.839 --> 3736.72
the five dollar super chat donation

3731.599 --> 3736.7200000000003
here is some tea and honey money thanks

3739.28 --> 3744.4
that will definitely get me a package of

3741.839 --> 3744.4
green tea

3747.32 --> 3751.2000000000003
[Music]

3748.799 --> 3751.2
i think

3752.839 --> 3769.839
well probably not so much after

3756.799 --> 3769.839
but oh well it's the gesture that counts

3770.4 --> 3778.48
uh yes joseph three six nine

3775.24 --> 3781.52
kovitzaka definitely has something

3778.48 --> 3786.799
to do with flat earth awakening

3781.52 --> 3786.799
why because it's the next tier

3787.839 --> 3794.839
i think the flat earth awakening

3790.88 --> 3797.839
in its own way is kind of an honest

3794.839 --> 3797.839
test

3799.039 --> 3805.119
and yeah it's out here it's free

3802.48 --> 3806.0
they don't censor it as they used to

3805.119 --> 3807.839
because i think

3806.0 --> 3809.76
they're testing what would happen if

3807.839 --> 3813.119
they didn't

3809.76 --> 3815.28
because i guess the people now over the

3813.119 --> 3815.839
generations have become brainwashed

3815.28 --> 3818.799
enough

3815.839 --> 3820.0
where they will prevent themselves from

3818.799 --> 3822.0
looking into it

3820.0 --> 3823.44
so it doesn't have to be actively hidden

3822.0 --> 3827.2
from them anymore

3823.44 --> 3829.28
like it has had to be for like the last

3827.2 --> 3832.64
hundred years

3829.28 --> 3834.3190000000004
so now

3832.64 --> 3836.48
now that flat earth has been out here

3834.319 --> 3838.88
for some time

3836.48 --> 3840.0
now is the next step i think that the

3838.88 --> 3843.92
kovit

3840.0 --> 3847.359
saga as you say it is simply

3843.92 --> 3850.48
the next peak the next depth

3847.359 --> 3854.0
the next staircase down

3850.48 --> 3857.359
the next thread the staircase downwards

3854.0 --> 3859.039
into deeper mind control and flat earth

3857.359 --> 3861.44
might have been like a test case

3859.039 --> 3864.2400000000002
partially for it just to see how bad the

3861.44 --> 3867.52
conditioning actually turned out to be

3864.24 --> 3870.16
how the dynamics happen when

3867.52 --> 3872.0
people are confronted with and or well

3870.16 --> 3875.2799999999997
with open

3872.0 --> 3875.28
awakening information

3876.16 --> 3879.2
and i think that they've become

3877.68 --> 3883.1189999999997
satisfied enough

3879.2 --> 3886.96
that there will still be plenty of

3883.119 --> 3890.319
absolute idiots to fool

3886.96 --> 3894.16
and enslave and drain

3890.319 --> 3894.799
so and that yeah part of that new

3894.16 --> 3898.16
project

3894.799 --> 3901.839
is the covit indoctrination it's

3898.16 --> 3901.839
the mask age

3904.64 --> 3908.0
now it could have been a lot worse if we

3907.28 --> 3910.7200000000003
hadn't

3908.0 --> 3912.4
all of us resisted it but of course we

3910.72 --> 3914.9599999999996
must

3912.4 --> 3917.039
so yeah it will probably eventually end

3914.96 --> 3920.16
up depending regionally on

3917.039 --> 3921.119
how bad it's going to be based on how

3920.16 --> 3924.3999999999996
much

3921.119 --> 3927.119
resistance people have given

3924.4 --> 3930.1600000000003
because i guess this is the next step

3927.119 --> 3933.839
it's like a resistance test

3930.16 --> 3938.0789999999997
when yeah people in control

3933.839 --> 3941.359
of things are just flaunting

3938.079 --> 3942.48
idiocy and bad policy and just bad

3941.359 --> 3944.799
actions

3942.48 --> 3951.839
in your face how many people will stand

3944.799 --> 3954.96
up against it

3951.839 --> 3958.96
and yeah you must if you don't

3954.96 --> 3965.599
you're gonna go to hell not when you die

3958.96 --> 3967.52
here on earth

3965.599 --> 3969.599
that that's why i've been pretty

3967.52 --> 3971.7599999999998
hardcore and adamant about the whole

3969.599 --> 3974.6400000000003
situation from the get-go

3971.76 --> 3975.44
saying no it doesn't exist it's all

3974.64 --> 3979.0389999999998
hundred

3975.44 --> 3982.16
percent lie every fraction of it

3979.039 --> 3982.96
every fraction every little piece of

3982.16 --> 3987.52
information

3982.96 --> 3990.48
it's a lie everything was never anything

3987.52 --> 3991.28
at best they had some weird mutant

3990.48 --> 3994.96
creation

3991.28 --> 3998.1600000000003
micro cellular organism thing

3994.96 --> 3999.359
based on original virus response

3998.16 --> 4001.2
mechanisms

3999.359 --> 4002.799
and then just made a frankenstein thing

4001.2 --> 4005.4399999999996
of it and then said oh my god

4002.799 --> 4007.44
theoretically this is a monster

4005.44 --> 4009.28
that's the best they've done in my

4007.44 --> 4012.799
opinion i don't think there's

4009.28 --> 4015.28
anything other than just

4012.799 --> 4017.0389999999998
poisoning people and radiating them or

4015.28 --> 4019.3590000000004
whatever with cell phone

4017.039 --> 4020.88
things 5g that sort of thing and then

4019.359 --> 4024.5589999999997
just causing them to get

4020.88 --> 4028.4
a cold and that's then the driver

4024.559 --> 4031.28
the sparker for this mind control

4028.4 --> 4033.6800000000003
panic science fiction novel that is

4031.28 --> 4035.039
being unleashed upon the western world

4033.68 --> 4037.9199999999996
and pretty much the entire world

4035.039 --> 4040.079
wherever they allow it

4037.92 --> 4041.52
wherever governments are permitting it

4040.079 --> 4044.319
pretty much

4041.52 --> 4044.319
so yeah

4047.359 --> 4051.5989999999997
hundred percent mind control hundred

4050.559 --> 4054.559
percent

4051.599 --> 4058.2400000000002
very deeply rooted within the entire

4054.559 --> 4062.6400000000003
foundations of the medical system itself

4058.24 --> 4065.2
it's that extensive the roots are very

4062.64 --> 4066.64
deep to this mind control experiment you

4065.2 --> 4070.0
have to realize that

4066.64 --> 4072.16
it's very deep root

4070.0 --> 4075.119
this one is not just you don't just pull

4072.16 --> 4075.1189999999997
it out like that no

4075.2 --> 4083.0389999999998
the very foundations the misunderstood

4079.599 --> 4086.079
disproven fictional construct

4083.039 --> 4089.3590000000004
of the virus invasive micro

4086.079 --> 4091.76
species is

4089.359 --> 4092.5589999999997
part of the entire foundation of this

4091.76 --> 4096.799
conception

4092.559 --> 4096.799
of this mind control conception

4096.88 --> 4103.4400000000005
so yeah you believe in viruses

4100.159 --> 4105.839
well then almost you have no real excuse

4103.44 --> 4109.04
to even counter it

4105.839 --> 4109.04
because yeah

4109.759 --> 4113.359
you know if you believe anything about

4112.159 --> 4115.5199999999995
that

4113.359 --> 4117.1990000000005
then who's to say that there aren't

4115.52 --> 4121.6
these things out there

4117.199 --> 4125.44
right because you can't see them because

4121.6 --> 4125.4400000000005
blah blah blah whatever excuse

4126.4 --> 4131.12
now if you just realize that the entire

4128.64 --> 4132.64
original foundation of what it's even

4131.12 --> 4136.08
supposed to be

4132.64 --> 4137.679
the virus concept that it's just wrong

4136.08 --> 4139.759
and there's alternatives and they've

4137.679 --> 4142.96
been suppressed to all hell

4139.759 --> 4143.679
and yeah recently last year has been a

4142.96 --> 4146.719
lot of

4143.679 --> 4148.08
doctors subtly bringing it forth because

4146.719 --> 4150.4800000000005
they think it's critical

4148.08 --> 4151.5199999999995
to do that or yeah everything will go to

4150.48 --> 4153.199
hell

4151.52 --> 4155.52
so they just did what they thought was

4153.199 --> 4156.48
necessary and they brought forth the

4155.52 --> 4159.1990000000005
alternatives

4156.48 --> 4160.239
the much more viable alternatives with

4159.199 --> 4162.5599999999995
explanations

4160.239 --> 4163.5199999999995
and research background and everything

4162.56 --> 4165.839000000001
so

4163.52 --> 4167.120000000001
yeah now it's up to the people are you

4165.839 --> 4170.64
still gonna go with it

4167.12 --> 4172.64
like a freaking [ __ ] drone

4170.64 --> 4174.08
or because you need the money because

4172.64 --> 4174.64
you don't want to ask a question to the

4174.08 --> 4176.4
boss

4174.64 --> 4178.2390000000005
oh you don't want to look like you're a

4176.4 --> 4180.48
troublemaker

4178.239 --> 4181.678999999999
yeah yeah yeah well yeah then you're

4180.48 --> 4184.799
going to

4181.679 --> 4185.759
hell might take some time but you're

4184.799 --> 4188.88
going there

4185.759 --> 4194.4
might be a very long path but that's

4188.88 --> 4194.400000000001
where it goes so yeah good luck with

4200.84 --> 4203.84
that

4208.06 --> 4211.249000000001
[Music]

4214.84 --> 4217.84
so

4223.18 --> 4226.289000000001
[Music]

4228.84 --> 4234.32
right i you could also describe it in

4231.84 --> 4237.52
another fashion

4234.32 --> 4240.5599999999995
if company policy

4237.52 --> 4242.64
makes you enslave yourself

4240.56 --> 4245.04
then yeah it's up to you whether you

4242.64 --> 4247.280000000001
want to be a slave

4245.04 --> 4248.08
to the company through the policy or

4247.28 --> 4250.239
whether you

4248.08 --> 4252.32
reject the policy try to defend against

4250.239 --> 4255.919999999999
and then you might be ejected

4252.32 --> 4259.5199999999995
right is it worth it is it worth it

4255.92 --> 4260.96
to be enslaved just to not be ejected

4259.52 --> 4262.8
and yeah what's going to happen if

4260.96 --> 4264.8
everybody does that oh

4262.8 --> 4267.12
then everybody's enslaved well what's

4264.8 --> 4270.88
going to happen if everybody rejects it

4267.12 --> 4272.08
oh oh wait yeah companies aren't really

4270.88 --> 4273.28
going to be working anymore

4272.08 --> 4276.32
they're going to go bust they're not

4273.28 --> 4276.32
going to make their money

4276.88 --> 4280.4800000000005
what's the better choice here

4281.76 --> 4287.84
when you weigh that what do you think

4295.12 --> 4300.08
because yeah if companies are just gonna

4297.92 --> 4303.6
go bust then maybe they'll

4300.08 --> 4307.6
try something else maybe they'll not

4303.6 --> 4309.4400000000005
forward such enslavement policy anymore

4307.6 --> 4310.64
because yeah then they have an excuse

4309.44 --> 4312.639999999999
yeah if i do this

4310.64 --> 4315.84
yeah everybody's gonna quit i can't do

4312.64 --> 4315.84
it because i'll go bust

4317.28 --> 4320.32
oh that's a pretty good reason not to do

4319.04 --> 4322.08
it

4320.32 --> 4330.799999999999
but everybody's just going to go along

4322.08 --> 4330.8
with it yeah it's only going to get

4334.21 --> 4338.06
[Music]

4340.84 --> 4343.84
worse

4344.96 --> 4348.96
right because i predict this if it

4347.84 --> 4351.04
hasn't happened already

4348.96 --> 4353.04
what's going to go to hell next it's the

4351.04 --> 4356.48
next phase

4353.04 --> 4360.239
health insurance

4356.48 --> 4363.839999999999
it's gonna go completely to hell

4360.239 --> 4367.04
completely it's gonna be all mangled up

4363.84 --> 4370.32
through the freaking covet [ __ ]

4367.04 --> 4371.199
it's gonna literally be a giant black

4370.32 --> 4373.92
hole waste

4371.199 --> 4376.639999999999
that does not provide a single useful

4373.92 --> 4376.64
thing anymore

4376.96 --> 4381.04
and hey some countries already half have

4379.6 --> 4382.84
halfway this kind of

4381.04 --> 4384.4
situation well it's going to get even

4382.84 --> 4386.4800000000005
worse

4384.4 --> 4387.679
it's not going to promise a lot of good

4386.48 --> 4389.599999999999
for here either

4387.679 --> 4391.679
that's why i've already pretty much

4389.6 --> 4392.88
stepped away from the medical system

4391.679 --> 4395.28
entirely

4392.88 --> 4396.08
i might still go to a dentist for their

4395.28 --> 4398.639999999999
surgical

4396.08 --> 4399.44
abilities if that is necessary at some

4398.64 --> 4402.56
point but

4399.44 --> 4405.12
other than that hey there's a cat

4402.56 --> 4405.120000000001
at the door

4411.6 --> 4414.56
he was not a cat

4418.08 --> 4427.84
it was my roommate

4438.0 --> 4444.64
right well what i'd be working on

4441.28 --> 4445.04
if i was shop owners and people that

4444.64 --> 4446.96
have

4445.04 --> 4448.64
jobs and all kinds of things stores you

4446.96 --> 4450.0
know things that are being bothered by

4448.64 --> 4454.0
the coveted policy

4450.0 --> 4457.04
i'd band together in national

4454.0 --> 4458.159
maybe even broader groups uh what do you

4457.04 --> 4461.36
call together

4458.159 --> 4463.5199999999995
kind of like a miss sort of union

4461.36 --> 4464.4
maybe maybe there's a little bit too far

4463.52 --> 4467.76
it's not that

4464.4 --> 4468.719
like that just band together and

4467.76 --> 4473.04
actually just

4468.719 --> 4475.04
freaking sue the policy

4473.04 --> 4477.04
and everything that's tied in with it

4475.04 --> 4479.36
sue the people that are basically

4477.04 --> 4483.84
forcing this policy

4479.36 --> 4483.839999999999
or or i don't know

4484.48 --> 4487.839999999999
just trace it back to the people that

4486.4 --> 4490.159
are demanding it that are

4487.84 --> 4491.76
basically causing damage on people's

4490.159 --> 4497.839999999999
jobs and lives

4491.76 --> 4501.6
by enforcing this

4497.84 --> 4501.6
that's the next step that we could take

4502.08 --> 4506.5599999999995
like coordinate just put it out like

4503.92 --> 4508.719
which freaking store owners

4506.56 --> 4510.2390000000005
are making the bad decisions now we're

4508.719 --> 4512.08
going to be sjw

4510.239 --> 4513.599999999999
[ __ ] marxist freaks that are going to

4512.08 --> 4514.32
think exactly the same and do the

4513.6 --> 4516.400000000001
opposite like

4514.32 --> 4518.4
oh which one are you gonna follow the

4516.4 --> 4521.44
corona policies will you just [ __ ]

4518.4 --> 4525.12
kick them out of the way just piss the

4521.44 --> 4527.919999999999
[ __ ] off

4525.12 --> 4529.76
you freaking freak get in your house and

4527.92 --> 4530.4800000000005
quarantine yourself and never come out

4529.76 --> 4533.76
again just

4530.48 --> 4536.718999999999
[ __ ] off right

4533.76 --> 4537.76
but we still got to do the opposite of

4536.719 --> 4540.4
that

4537.76 --> 4541.679
and kind of like figure out who are the

4540.4 --> 4543.839999999999
store owners that are

4541.679 --> 4544.8
like really forcing this [ __ ] on

4543.84 --> 4546.96
everyone

4544.8 --> 4548.64
why are they doing that do they have

4546.96 --> 4552.64
some money interest

4548.64 --> 4555.280000000001
can that be proven can it be highlighted

4552.64 --> 4555.679
and rammed over the head with like oh

4555.28 --> 4557.679
you're

4555.679 --> 4559.84
[ __ ] everybody over because you're

4557.679 --> 4564.08
secretly making some money you

4559.84 --> 4567.92
[ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4564.08 --> 4573.76
sue your ass give us that [ __ ] money

4567.92 --> 4573.76
[ __ ] that that's what you should be

4578.84 --> 4581.84
doing

4582.0 --> 4588.239
ah sorry for the rough language

4586.65 --> 4591.5199999999995
[Music]

4588.239 --> 4594.239
it's just nothing pisses me more off

4591.52 --> 4597.56
than people that are like

4594.239 --> 4601.599999999999
making money off just absolute this

4597.56 --> 4604.719
nonsensical waste i hate it

4601.6 --> 4608.320000000001
horrific i i can't believe that's just

4604.719 --> 4609.12
happening that people choose to go with

4608.32 --> 4612.08
that

4609.12 --> 4612.08
so repulsive

4616.96 --> 4620.84
all right it is sick but yeah it should

4619.76 --> 4624.320000000001
be

4620.84 --> 4626.08
suitable if you're literally if you can

4624.32 --> 4628.239
prove about somebody that they are

4626.08 --> 4632.08
making money like of

4628.239 --> 4634.839999999999
covid investment funds or whatever

4632.08 --> 4637.44
that they're making profits of this

4634.84 --> 4639.76
provably

4637.44 --> 4642.159
that yeah if they are literally then

4639.76 --> 4644.400000000001
forcing that policy

4642.159 --> 4645.36
on other people through whatever control

4644.4 --> 4649.12
they have

4645.36 --> 4652.08
then they should be sued for the full

4649.12 --> 4652.08
profit they make

4655.28 --> 4659.04
and then maybe after that happens a

4657.199 --> 4662.239
couple of times people will realize

4659.04 --> 4662.56
oh wait if i'm gonna screw people over

4662.239 --> 4665.678999999999
by

4662.56 --> 4667.84
forcing this policy on them yeah they're

4665.679 --> 4669.1990000000005
gonna take my money

4667.84 --> 4671.92
because if they don't do it they

4669.199 --> 4672.719
probably will still make some money out

4671.92 --> 4676.64
of it

4672.719 --> 4678.4
little something

4676.64 --> 4680.320000000001
maybe i don't know how it works what

4678.4 --> 4683.759999999999
they even did

4680.32 --> 4687.04
but yeah that way

4683.76 --> 4688.08
at least the world will not be as

4687.04 --> 4693.84
burdened by

4688.08 --> 4693.84
those nonsense policies so

4701.12 --> 4704.32
all right here we go again

4704.96 --> 4711.12
uh yeah not not anytime soon though

4715.04 --> 4721.84
but yes i've seen things

4723.6 --> 4727.679
but yeah what is even a hot war anymore

4725.76 --> 4729.360000000001
you know it's it's not just gonna be

4727.679 --> 4731.84
everything's blowing up like in the

4729.36 --> 4731.839999999999
movies

4733.76 --> 4738.96
no not soon of course not

4737.04 --> 4741.199
it's first it's just going to be a lot

4738.96 --> 4742.32
of grandstanding and maneuvering and

4741.199 --> 4748.08
then just

4742.32 --> 4751.599999999999
until it completely freezes up

4748.08 --> 4751.6
but that's gonna take some time

4754.08 --> 4759.76
so it's gonna be more like a cold war

4757.04 --> 4763.199
situation

4759.76 --> 4764.719
i think with some like oh suddenly

4763.199 --> 4766.5599999999995
something happens like oh

4764.719 --> 4768.2390000000005
wait where did they come from like

4766.56 --> 4770.56
secret

4768.239 --> 4771.678999999999
territory infiltrations and then yeah

4770.56 --> 4774.96
they did

4771.679 --> 4774.96
yeah i don't know man

4775.199 --> 4779.919999999999
but not just like in in big war movies

4778.159 --> 4782.159
it's just gonna go full out not like

4779.92 --> 4782.159
that

4788.96 --> 4792.56
yeah although i don't know

4793.12 --> 4797.36
i don't think so let's just say i've

4796.96 --> 4800.8
never

4797.36 --> 4803.599999999999
remembered just seeing entire destroyed

4800.8 --> 4805.84
cities like in the real world

4803.6 --> 4808.320000000001
never seen it ever it's only in the

4805.84 --> 4808.32
movies

4810.88 --> 4815.36
and yeah in the dark world vision i i

4813.36 --> 4818.5599999999995
kind of really tried to

4815.36 --> 4821.759999999999
i set out to try to know to

4818.56 --> 4823.4400000000005
distinguish like because in my head i

4821.76 --> 4826.08
kind of did

4823.44 --> 4827.44
as some trolls still like to echo the

4826.08 --> 4830.88
what they think is a joke

4827.44 --> 4832.32
oh arwen saved the world in 2005 or

4830.88 --> 4836.159000000001
something what did i say

4832.32 --> 4838.96
i don't remember exactly but yeah

4836.159 --> 4840.638999999999
in that vision i don't exactly even know

4838.96 --> 4845.04
what it was

4840.639 --> 4847.6
but i know that i was greatly concerned

4845.04 --> 4850.88
in general with trying to prevent the

4847.6 --> 4853.52
destruction of the entire world

4850.88 --> 4855.4400000000005
like yeah everything blowing up i was

4853.52 --> 4857.280000000001
concerned with that in retrospect i

4855.44 --> 4858.5599999999995
don't even know for sure if it is

4857.28 --> 4861.92
physically possible

4858.56 --> 4865.120000000001
but i was very concerned with it

4861.92 --> 4869.12
and i was looking and cross-referencing

4865.12 --> 4869.84
and yeah i don't remember having seen

4869.12 --> 4872.639
anything

4869.84 --> 4874.2390000000005
like this big blown-up cities other than

4872.639 --> 4878.159000000001
in movies

4874.239 --> 4882.0
and yeah and beirut

4878.159 --> 4882.0
so that i recognize that one

4885.84 --> 4889.28
so yeah there might be some places blown

4888.4 --> 4892.0
up sort of

4889.28 --> 4893.759999999999
but it's not like like armageddon style

4892.0 --> 4896.4
or movie like ooh

4893.76 --> 4896.96
or the nuke drops and it all blows up in

4896.4 --> 4899.5199999999995
a bi

4896.96 --> 4903.84
followed by a ball of fire or something

4899.52 --> 4903.84
no no

4914.4 --> 4918.4
what are you talking about here we go

4928.84 --> 4931.84
again

4941.199 --> 4944.159
all right well george sanford i don't

4942.56 --> 4946.88
know turn off the news all countries

4944.159 --> 4949.92
work together on the script

4946.88 --> 4951.92
again just because they

4949.92 --> 4954.96
work together to basically uphold a

4951.92 --> 4957.36
consistent narrative for the cattle

4954.96 --> 4958.08
doesn't mean they're not opponents in

4957.36 --> 4962.5599999999995
reality

4958.08 --> 4962.5599999999995
it's just that it's

4963.199 --> 4968.879999999999
they're fighting but they're also

4966.239 --> 4970.879999999999
representing so they're fighting under

4968.88 --> 4974.639
certain agreements

4970.88 --> 4977.28
see that's how it works

4974.639 --> 4979.1990000000005
because they're not all just everybody

4977.28 --> 4979.5199999999995
believes we're enemies it's all just an

4979.199 --> 4983.44
act

4979.52 --> 4986.8
no not at all it's just that

4983.44 --> 4989.28
have certain conventions on how to

4986.8 --> 4990.639
do things and agreements and to make

4989.28 --> 4994.8
things smoother

4990.639 --> 4998.0
for everyone like a controlled conflict

4994.8 --> 5000.72
as it were that that's what they aim for

4998.0 --> 5002.56
doesn't mean they're not enemies

5000.72 --> 5003.84
[Music]

5002.56 --> 5005.84
although it doesn't have to mean that

5003.84 --> 5008.96
they really are enemies because hey

5005.84 --> 5010.32
with that system you can also act like

5008.96 --> 5014.719
your enemies

5010.32 --> 5017.28
for a very long time

5014.719 --> 5018.08
some of you might have picked up upon

5017.28 --> 5020.48
one of those

5018.08 --> 5021.5199999999995
specific relations that has been going

5020.48 --> 5029.839999999999
on for

5021.52 --> 5029.84
a very very long time

5031.7 --> 5034.83
[Music]

5040.32 --> 5043.44
and now of course i'm talking about

5042.56 --> 5046.4800000000005
russia

5043.44 --> 5050.32
and the united states

5046.48 --> 5053.44
the yeah the the basically the

5050.32 --> 5053.44
the boxing partners

5053.76 --> 5058.88
it's like like rocky the comparison is

5057.44 --> 5061.36
uncanny they're like

5058.88 --> 5063.76
the ultimate opponents but they're

5061.36 --> 5066.799999999999
actually just partners

5063.76 --> 5070.0
in ways but they are like

5066.8 --> 5072.08
their ego is invested in be dominating

5070.0 --> 5074.719
the other so it's almost like a

5072.08 --> 5074.719
brotherly

5075.199 --> 5082.239
conflict it's it yeah

5079.44 --> 5082.719
politics it's complicated [ __ ] like that

5082.239 --> 5084.4
but

5082.719 --> 5086.08
yeah they've worked together in many

5084.4 --> 5089.599999999999
ways and in other ways they

5086.08 --> 5099.84
oppose one another so yeah

5089.6 --> 5101.4400000000005
it's complicated

5099.84 --> 5103.4400000000005
all right i'm gonna run out the show by

5101.44 --> 5106.159
the way

5103.44 --> 5106.159
very soon

5109.199 --> 5115.678999999999
find links to china selling secrets

5112.32 --> 5119.12
yeah no doubt china has been basically

5115.679 --> 5121.679
hacking secrets every where they

5119.12 --> 5123.28
yeah they could reach that's been known

5121.679 --> 5126.8
for a while that's just their that's

5123.28 --> 5130.08
even like their standard policy

5126.8 --> 5131.1990000000005
like they've tried to bootleg the entire

5130.08 --> 5134.4
world

5131.199 --> 5137.199
and they've been i don't know halfway

5134.4 --> 5137.199
decent at it

5137.52 --> 5140.88
they started really shitty now they're

5139.92 --> 5145.76
not really

5140.88 --> 5147.52
supreme but they have improved at least

5145.76 --> 5148.8
in the quality of some of their products

5147.52 --> 5151.52
but it's still yeah

5148.8 --> 5153.04
i don't like the concept of the entire

5151.52 --> 5155.280000000001
setup like that

5153.04 --> 5158.32
i would prefer much more local based

5155.28 --> 5158.32
production to keep

5159.12 --> 5166.88
yeah more skilled people together

5162.48 --> 5169.599999999999
to innovate because this

5166.88 --> 5170.56
yeah this giant centralized mass

5169.6 --> 5175.1990000000005
production

5170.56 --> 5178.56
situation it really kind of destroys

5175.199 --> 5179.599999999999
yeah the innovation a lot because it

5178.56 --> 5181.679
becomes just too

5179.6 --> 5184.08
cheap and then it's too easy and then

5181.679 --> 5186.8
you don't need to innovate anymore

5184.08 --> 5188.719
to get out of your situation you just

5186.8 --> 5191.04
get the cheap [ __ ]

5188.719 --> 5193.52
and throw it away when it breaks it's

5191.04 --> 5193.5199999999995
terrible

5194.56 --> 5198.400000000001
yeah yeah china believes in the globe of

5196.48 --> 5201.5199999999995
course of course

5198.4 --> 5204.638999999999
china is pretty hardcore atheist

5201.52 --> 5204.639
hardcore immoral
