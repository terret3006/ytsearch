yesterday

it has it's kind of hazy up there but

110.0 --> 115.84
still

111.52 --> 115.84
still some coming through but

122.56 --> 127.2
i think somebody up there is kind of

125.2 --> 128.56
sick of all this clear blue skies or

127.2 --> 130.959
something

128.56 --> 130.959
you know

131.599 --> 136.07999999999998
but yeah it's still nice and warm

133.599 --> 136.07999999999998
actually

136.239 --> 139.59900000000002
today when i went out for groceries i

138.16 --> 142.0
actually just

139.599 --> 143.92
didn't even have my sweater on

142.0 --> 144.8
underneath my jacket

143.92 --> 146.79999999999998
so

144.8 --> 148.56
it's really nice and warm out there even

146.8 --> 150.0
with the wind the wind is also kind of

148.56 --> 151.599
mild

150.0 --> 154.92
temperature

151.599 --> 154.92
really nice

157.2 --> 159.51899999999998
all right

167.12 --> 172.31900000000002
hello elise g first in chat daniel

170.16 --> 174.239
robles m appeal

172.319 --> 180.28
good to see you all

174.239 --> 180.28
it is sunday the 13th of march 2022.

182.319 --> 185.83999999999997
jeff gassett hello

187.76 --> 190.07999999999998
all right

188.72 --> 192.48
so

190.08 --> 196.15900000000002
i'm doing a bit better than yesterday it

192.48 --> 199.35999999999999
got really painful though my jaw

196.159 --> 202.0
it was really like i basically think at

199.36 --> 204.0
some point the day before yesterday

202.0 --> 207.04
which would be friday i

204.0 --> 210.08
yeah i accidentally made a wound

207.04 --> 212.319
like in my gums

210.08 --> 214.64000000000001
because it was yeah that can happen you

212.319 --> 215.67999999999998
know if you bite down on something hard

214.64 --> 217.67999999999998
and

215.68 --> 220.48000000000002
it's basically

217.68 --> 222.239
not positioned on your molders correctly

220.48 --> 224.319
yeah and

222.239 --> 226.4
because it's been like

224.319 --> 228.07999999999998
almost throbbing and very painful

226.4 --> 230.87900000000002
especially in the evening it was just

228.08 --> 230.87900000000002
very painful

232.4 --> 235.04
and uh

233.76 --> 238.84
yeah

235.04 --> 241.84
so i kind of didn't go onto ball

238.84 --> 243.84
busters it was live

241.84 --> 246.31900000000002
i did kind of want to but i was just

243.84 --> 248.56
like uh

246.319 --> 249.67999999999998
like i wasn't really gonna

248.56 --> 250.48
be able to

249.68 --> 255.31900000000002
just

250.48 --> 255.319
have a lot of input so i stuck to chat

255.36 --> 260.639
right but today's a little better it's

258.239 --> 262.4
i can at least just bite down now

260.639 --> 264.8
without like

262.4 --> 266.4
right so it's better i think probably

264.8 --> 269.44
tomorrow it'll be

266.4 --> 272.56
gone or almost gone so very happy that

269.44 --> 275.759
at least it has restored

272.56 --> 277.68
for a big part this night

275.759 --> 280.47900000000004
and i had yeah i had a shower that

277.68 --> 280.479
probably helps

281.84 --> 286.0
uh

283.68 --> 288.24
right i have to i'd have to remember

286.0 --> 292.639
also that now that it is getting warmer

288.24 --> 292.639
i probably need to shower more regularly

294.88 --> 300.15999999999997
ah

297.6 --> 303.6
because i don't really shower all that

300.16 --> 305.91900000000004
regularly as everybody knows

303.6 --> 308.08000000000004
you can pretty much tell by

305.919 --> 311.84
usually me having

308.08 --> 311.84
loose hair the next day

312.0 --> 316.24
because it is kind of nice

314.08 --> 318.24
and it's just all

316.24 --> 319.36
cleaned

318.24 --> 322.0
anyway

319.36 --> 322.0
low clutch

322.639 --> 330.24
subscribers only is the new change yes

326.16 --> 330.24
and it's working just great

330.479 --> 334.32
i'm really happy about it

335.68 --> 339.039
right

337.12 --> 341.919
i mean i wanted to do originally a

339.039 --> 341.919
subscribe or a

342.0 --> 346.639
members only but then a lot of people

344.88 --> 348.56
that don't have wrenches and aren't

346.639 --> 349.68
members yeah they just wouldn't be able

348.56 --> 350.96
to

349.68 --> 353.36
chat

350.96 --> 356.23999999999995
so this is really a great solution yeah

353.36 --> 356.24
very happy about it

356.319 --> 359.199
hey kevlar

361.68 --> 365.08
adam price

379.28 --> 383.52
orphan red

382.0 --> 384.72
right

383.52 --> 389.039
yeah she's

384.72 --> 394.199
she is kind of interesting but weird

389.039 --> 394.199
it's a very very weird vibe to her

406.16 --> 409.36
but yeah remember her

414.72 --> 420.08000000000004
multiple sun model oh dear

418.4 --> 423.67999999999995
really antonio has a

420.08 --> 427.039
does he have a multiple sun model

423.68 --> 427.039
i didn't even realize that

431.44 --> 436.08
that all part of like his book of the

433.44 --> 438.24
sun

436.08 --> 440.56
anyway i got some yeah

438.24 --> 444.28000000000003
grapefruit juice

440.56 --> 444.28000000000003
feels really good

450.8 --> 453.039
ah

454.96 --> 460.44
extra vitamin c

456.88 --> 460.44
the more the better

487.919 --> 493.12
multiple

489.24 --> 494.72
sunscreen lesson

493.12 --> 497.039
into the sun

494.72 --> 497.03900000000004
what

502.56 --> 506.52
what what does that mean

520.0 --> 526.0
huh all right adam appeal yeah

522.88 --> 527.8389999999999
now grapefruit juice is amazing but it

526.0 --> 530.32
is

527.839 --> 532.399
for me every time

530.32 --> 535.839
when i like start to remember it it's

532.399 --> 535.839
always like during springtime

536.24 --> 541.279
right because like even this winter

538.8 --> 543.68
though like when was it in november i

541.279 --> 546.56
had like a a bottle of grapefruit juice

543.68 --> 546.56
just sitting there

546.64 --> 551.8389999999999
and opened for like a month

549.839 --> 553.9200000000001
and i i did notice i didn't know what

551.839 --> 555.6
was there i just didn't feel like it

553.92 --> 557.8389999999999
right

555.6 --> 560.32
but like around

557.839 --> 563.519
a week ago i just noticed like

560.32 --> 566.88
grapefruit juice grapefruit juice that's

563.519 --> 568.64
this is the moment for it so yeah

566.88 --> 570.8
i always follow my impulses like that

568.64 --> 574.16
but i'm noticing that grapefruit juice

570.8 --> 575.4399999999999
for me is always like starting to

574.16 --> 578.3199999999999
call

575.44 --> 581.519
call me starts to call me

578.32 --> 581.519
around springtime

587.68 --> 593.3599999999999
combined gathered together well that's a

590.399 --> 593.36
very vague

595.04 --> 598.8
way to describe it elishee

599.6 --> 603.839
i mean

600.56 --> 606.16
do they visually

603.839 --> 609.2
that it's like oh there's just always

606.16 --> 610.8
multiple suns up there somewhere but

609.2 --> 611.6
because of the

610.8 --> 615.1999999999999
the

611.6 --> 619.76
the atmosphere the gases in the realm

615.2 --> 620.5600000000001
it somehow lenses into a singular sun is

619.76 --> 623.36
that

620.56 --> 623.3599999999999
what he's saying

624.16 --> 628.8
or is it like oh there used to be three

626.48 --> 631.9200000000001
suns and then they merged and now that

628.8 --> 634.399
is the sun like which one is it like a

631.92 --> 636.7199999999999
literal merger

634.399 --> 640.04
or just like a visual merger through

636.72 --> 640.0400000000001
weird lensing

661.2 --> 665.399
didn't antonio die yeah

679.44 --> 683.6800000000001
a literal merger ah thank you elise g

682.0 --> 685.6
right so it's

683.68 --> 686.7199999999999
he made a mythical story out of it

685.6 --> 689.6
because

686.72 --> 691.36
how could you ever prove that

689.6 --> 693.76
right

691.36 --> 694.8000000000001
and it he probably

693.76 --> 695.92
like

694.8 --> 697.04
cross

695.92 --> 698.399
uh

697.04 --> 700.64
engineered

698.399 --> 702.88
his story also with the trinity like

700.64 --> 704.56
three become one right the son jesus

702.88 --> 707.12
christ the son

704.56 --> 710.2399999999999
that he was very much onto that track he

707.12 --> 712.16
was kind of agnostic like that

710.24 --> 714.16
was not christian

712.16 --> 716.7199999999999
so that would make typical sense that he

714.16 --> 717.519
would let yeah conjure an idea like that

716.72 --> 718.88
whoa

717.519 --> 721.2
there were three

718.88 --> 723.76
sons and then they merged into one and

721.2 --> 725.519
that that is what the trinity story is

723.76 --> 727.04
based on or something i might have not

725.519 --> 729.2
said that

727.04 --> 731.68
but that that that's definitely like a

729.2 --> 733.76
correlatory conclusion

731.68 --> 734.88
you could draw from listening to such a

733.76 --> 737.12
story

734.88 --> 738.639
right because what's the freaking proof

737.12 --> 741.12
of that like oh

738.639 --> 743.76
you can see it how it merges into one

741.12 --> 744.48
sun like every morning or something like

743.76 --> 746.16
no

744.48 --> 748.16
so we suggest that's something that

746.16 --> 749.76
happened in the far far past like oh

748.16 --> 751.4399999999999
really where's the evidence oh you don't

749.76 --> 753.68
have any okay

751.44 --> 753.6800000000001
right

754.24 --> 760.399
i mean he was kind of a

758.24 --> 763.2
a bit of a wizard

760.399 --> 765.68
in a naughty way

763.2 --> 766.88
he did like to make up like

765.68 --> 770.16
basically

766.88 --> 770.16
fantastical stories

770.32 --> 778.0
like i

773.839 --> 778.0
use that same creativity but

779.279 --> 784.24
yeah i've

780.8 --> 787.279
really trained myself to basically not

784.24 --> 789.44
anchor myself into ideas that i conjured

787.279 --> 791.68
myself

789.44 --> 791.6800000000001
right

792.639 --> 797.12
and despite all that i'm still

795.12 --> 800.8
stuck in some odd positions

797.12 --> 801.68
philosophically right

800.8 --> 804.8
like

801.68 --> 806.56
the holographic nature of the celestials

804.8 --> 807.92
which is a very different approach by

806.56 --> 810.16
the way

807.92 --> 812.079
i don't think that

810.16 --> 814.16
because i did actually one-on-one

812.079 --> 817.519
communicate some with antonio subaru i

814.16 --> 820.3199999999999
don't think he ever got that

817.519 --> 822.72
he always responded like oh that sounds

820.32 --> 824.9590000000001
kind of interesting but he didn't give

822.72 --> 825.839
any sign that he was actually letting it

824.959 --> 829.279
in

825.839 --> 833.1990000000001
and considering it so he was definitely

829.279 --> 833.199
not about a holographic skies

836.0 --> 839.12
but yeah the thing is

840.8 --> 846.24
when i say a holographic skies

843.6 --> 848.9590000000001
philosophy idea theory is really like

846.24 --> 850.16
what is right now like what is it not

848.959 --> 852.88
like oh

850.16 --> 855.199
how did it come to be like that and then

852.88 --> 856.959
some mythical story about how it became

855.199 --> 859.04
holographic or something right no it's

856.959 --> 859.92
just like this is what it is how do we

859.04 --> 861.5999999999999
know

859.92 --> 864.24
that

861.6 --> 866.0790000000001
and yeah unfortunately the only real

864.24 --> 869.6800000000001
cornerstone evidence i have to rest on

866.079 --> 872.16
is like yeah it's just not physical

869.68 --> 875.12
none of it is physical it's as physical

872.16 --> 877.4399999999999
as the horizon that we see

875.12 --> 878.72
it's just pure optics

877.44 --> 880.8800000000001
and

878.72 --> 882.839
yeah there's no sign of any of the

880.88 --> 887.24
celestials that they're

882.839 --> 888.8000000000001
like physical objects or even light

887.24 --> 891.6800000000001
manifestations

888.8 --> 894.079
based on very specific positions in

891.68 --> 897.12
space

894.079 --> 898.88
it's all just angular and consistently

897.12 --> 900.8
angular right there's no sign of

898.88 --> 904.48
anything moving

900.8 --> 906.16
on a plane parallel to earth

904.48 --> 908.8000000000001
visually

906.16 --> 910.3199999999999
as it moves visually

908.8 --> 911.279
right so yeah

910.32 --> 913.44
i

911.279 --> 915.8389999999999
it's different but it is kind of like

913.44 --> 917.7600000000001
almost the same thing it's just

915.839 --> 920.32
borderline wizardry

917.76 --> 923.6
but it's not naughty

920.32 --> 923.6
i'm not screwing around

924.079 --> 929.04
like antonio used to do and he loved

926.56 --> 929.04
doing that

929.519 --> 934.399
he was good at it

932.48 --> 936.72
i mean when he would be conjuring a

934.399 --> 939.36
story it would to me be like oh he's

936.72 --> 941.6800000000001
gonna tell a story and he didn't like oh

939.36 --> 943.44
he's going to bring the glorious truth

941.68 --> 946.2399999999999
but it was just always kind of

943.44 --> 950.9200000000001
interesting to listen

946.24 --> 950.92
how he would describe his ideas

958.639 --> 961.639
do

968.56 --> 972.399
right show with seeking star yeah we

971.12 --> 974.079
could do that

972.399 --> 977.079
steamy traveler

974.079 --> 977.079
yeah

1000.56 --> 1004.88
okay i'm appeal well

1002.959 --> 1008.2399999999999
yeah i never heard of him but

1004.88 --> 1008.24
don't dox him or something

1009.12 --> 1011.839
uh

1019.279 --> 1023.68
don't remember

1020.88 --> 1026.559
i don't did antonio

1023.68 --> 1028.3999999999999
no he didn't show up in the 2019 there

1026.559 --> 1031.839
was a lot of like

1028.4 --> 1031.8390000000002
friction back then already

1034.24 --> 1038.24
with antonio and a whole bunch of people

1036.64 --> 1039.679
like he had been basically trying to

1038.24 --> 1043.839
personally attack a whole bunch of

1039.679 --> 1043.8390000000002
people and of course patricia stare

1044.079 --> 1049.24
but i like almost met him in 2019

1049.28 --> 1053.3999999999999
i don't think he showed up

1053.76 --> 1059.679
i don't remember he might have showed up

1056.4 --> 1059.679
after all i don't know

1065.6 --> 1069.28
never thought of ducks don't worry about

1067.44 --> 1071.76
it it's just that

1069.28 --> 1074.08
your friend right it's

1071.76 --> 1076.16
they don't want to be dogs i mean i am

1074.08 --> 1078.84
effectively dogs

1076.16 --> 1082.4
like i don't mind

1078.84 --> 1085.9189999999999
right my address and even my freaking

1082.4 --> 1087.6000000000001
phone number seem to be well known

1085.919 --> 1089.44
by trolls

1087.6 --> 1091.6789999999999
so it doesn't really matter anymore

1089.44 --> 1091.679
right

1091.84 --> 1096.0
but yeah that friend of yours might not

1094.799 --> 1099.84
want to be

1096.0 --> 1103.36
known to be associated right

1099.84 --> 1103.36
so you gotta be careful

1106.4 --> 1110.88
i should interview jeff

1108.64 --> 1110.88
what

1111.679 --> 1114.0
okay

1117.039 --> 1123.84
enjoy star wars

1120.08 --> 1123.84
it could be interesting clutch

1124.72 --> 1130.64
it it all depends

1128.16 --> 1131.76
i've i've tried to envision that

1130.64 --> 1134.8400000000001
because

1131.76 --> 1138.24
i did notice just so

1134.84 --> 1140.1599999999999
much kind of hidden things

1138.24 --> 1142.0
boiling underneath the surface with with

1140.16 --> 1143.52
seeking star water even in that show

1142.0 --> 1145.2
that she was doing

1143.52 --> 1149.24
so i don't know

1145.2 --> 1149.24
like how it would be

1151.36 --> 1155.4399999999998
to do a show with her i don't know what

1153.039 --> 1158.24
it would be like

1155.44 --> 1160.64
i think that if we want to do that i'd

1158.24 --> 1163.76
prefer that we first just kind of get to

1160.64 --> 1166.64
know each other face to face

1163.76 --> 1169.919
over skype in one-on-one calls seeking

1166.64 --> 1171.76
star wars if you can't do that

1169.919 --> 1175.2
that would be a great starter and then

1171.76 --> 1175.2
we can work out like hey

1175.679 --> 1180.72
what is it you want to present

1177.52 --> 1183.9189999999999
are there like detailed issues or

1180.72 --> 1185.84
like communication

1183.919 --> 1188.0800000000002
issues for example like things you

1185.84 --> 1190.6399999999999
absolutely don't want me to do during

1188.08 --> 1192.72
the show etc right or

1190.64 --> 1195.919
like if you have focus problems that i

1192.72 --> 1198.32
can pay extra attention

1195.919 --> 1202.5590000000002
i don't know if that's the case but yeah

1198.32 --> 1204.559
right it's it's better for me at least

1202.559 --> 1205.76
first just have a one-on-one private

1204.559 --> 1207.9189999999999
talk

1205.76 --> 1209.76
before we do a show together

1207.919 --> 1211.5200000000002
we can discuss it

1209.76 --> 1212.32
so if you're up for that seeking star

1211.52 --> 1214.32
wars

1212.32 --> 1216.96
my skype address is in the description

1214.32 --> 1216.96
box below

1217.52 --> 1221.28
let me know

1219.36 --> 1223.4399999999998
hidden it's just

1221.28 --> 1225.76
seeking star wars you're like a freaking

1223.44 --> 1227.8400000000001
balloon filled with energy there's just

1225.76 --> 1230.72
so much like i could see it all the time

1227.84 --> 1233.039
you were like i see so much i gotta say

1230.72 --> 1234.72
i gotta somehow translate it but at the

1233.039 --> 1236.24
same time these guys are kind of

1234.72 --> 1239.679
numpties they're not going to realize

1236.24 --> 1242.96
what i'm talking about i could just see

1239.679 --> 1244.72
you sitting there internally inside on

1242.96 --> 1246.4
this big

1244.72 --> 1248.4
pile of energy and all these things

1246.4 --> 1252.159
you've wanted to communicate but you

1248.4 --> 1252.159
didn't really know how so yeah i was

1254.32 --> 1259.4399999999998
i was seeing a lot of hidden things yeah

1256.799 --> 1261.12
this is what i do is i'm an empath

1259.44 --> 1263.8400000000001
almost telepath

1261.12 --> 1263.84
so

1267.84 --> 1273.84
right it wasn't like a

1269.76 --> 1276.72
saying like oh i don't trust you no no

1273.84 --> 1278.32
it's just that you it's kind of the same

1276.72 --> 1279.6000000000001
thing as with

1278.32 --> 1281.36
damn it

1279.6 --> 1284.1589999999999
what's her name again

1281.36 --> 1284.1589999999999
another lady

1286.64 --> 1290.0
robin stanley

1288.4 --> 1291.2800000000002
right i haven't heard from her in a

1290.0 --> 1293.28
while

1291.28 --> 1296.1589999999999
but she was also like a pretty

1293.28 --> 1297.52
complicated lady

1296.159 --> 1299.7600000000002
who was like

1297.52 --> 1302.24
would and she would typically like hold

1299.76 --> 1304.48
back naturally always even in one-on-one

1302.24 --> 1307.2
conversations right i had to really get

1304.48 --> 1307.2
used to that

1310.48 --> 1314.64
like you have to really figure out how

1312.559 --> 1316.48
to communicate with her and when you do

1314.64 --> 1319.3600000000001
then suddenly it's almost like you have

1316.48 --> 1321.3600000000001
a telepathic connection it's like we

1319.36 --> 1324.3999999999999
could for once we got it attuned

1321.36 --> 1328.08
properly in a conversation over skype

1324.4 --> 1328.0800000000002
then just suddenly it would be like

1328.4 --> 1332.96
we would just figure out each other's

1330.0 --> 1335.6
rhythm and almost yeah you wouldn't even

1332.96 --> 1337.44
have to say everything fully it's just a

1335.6 --> 1340.1589999999999
couple of words and you could

1337.44 --> 1343.2
immediately see the other like got it

1340.159 --> 1345.7600000000002
right almost telepathic

1343.2 --> 1347.679
but you had to get there first

1345.76 --> 1350.08
and i think maybe you got something

1347.679 --> 1350.0800000000002
similar

1354.559 --> 1358.2
hello flip flap

1366.4 --> 1372.88
i am too dumb too deaf guess

1370.4 --> 1376.48
you're too dumb to have to be on the

1372.88 --> 1376.48
show with me come on jeff

1377.36 --> 1381.3999999999999
that's not really true

1389.919 --> 1394.0800000000002
but yeah if you're gonna come on my show

1391.679 --> 1396.5590000000002
there it's good to really have subjects

1394.08 --> 1398.3999999999999
to talk about though

1396.559 --> 1402.2
that would kind of connect

1398.4 --> 1402.2
you gotta figure that out

1403.28 --> 1407.9189999999999
symbology is a huge subject in my life's

1405.679 --> 1407.919
work

1408.24 --> 1412.24
yeah so with

1409.6 --> 1415.3999999999999
the same goes with me

1412.24 --> 1415.4
let me

1416.32 --> 1419.28
share my old

1419.36 --> 1422.36
2006

1427.08 --> 1432.72
symbolics.nl

1428.84 --> 1435.76
website a whole bunch of text

1432.72 --> 1438.32
specifically analyzing everything about

1435.76 --> 1438.32
symbols

1438.48 --> 1443.2
and like yeah i'm still like kind of

1440.64 --> 1446.48
mystified reading this back it's like

1443.2 --> 1448.72
dude i wrote this

1446.48 --> 1452.48
such a long time ago

1448.72 --> 1456.4
and i'm just still like wow what is this

1452.48 --> 1458.559
i was like really deeply immersed like

1456.4 --> 1460.64
real so deeply immersed that i could at

1458.559 --> 1461.84
the time really not communicate it

1460.64 --> 1464.5590000000002
properly

1461.84 --> 1468.24
like i felt

1464.559 --> 1470.32
so isolated compared to now but it was

1468.24 --> 1472.159
okay it was like yeah i'm glad i'm

1470.32 --> 1474.559
isolated because i was almost like

1472.159 --> 1477.1200000000001
afraid of what i was seeing

1474.559 --> 1479.039
it's like okay well at least

1477.12 --> 1481.36
others can't handle that that's good

1479.039 --> 1485.799
because what the [ __ ] if they could

1481.36 --> 1485.799
holy [ __ ] that was scary

1486.32 --> 1488.559
right

1494.32 --> 1498.9189999999999
i linked to that before right right

1501.6 --> 1506.24
but it's still pretty amazing and

1503.84 --> 1508.6399999999999
some of it you know it's not perfectly

1506.24 --> 1508.64
written

1510.4 --> 1515.039
and some some places there are actually

1513.279 --> 1518.32
weird globe

1515.039 --> 1519.84
references right like metaphors using

1518.32 --> 1522.32
the globe

1519.84 --> 1524.1589999999999
like our globe understanding as a

1522.32 --> 1526.1589999999999
metaphor that's something that i used to

1524.159 --> 1531.0390000000002
do a lot

1526.159 --> 1533.919
like in my teens and throughout my 20s

1531.039 --> 1536.1589999999999
it's really weird now to see that back

1533.919 --> 1538.5590000000002
right oh yeah and i can't edit it i

1536.159 --> 1540.5590000000002
literally cannot edit this site

1538.559 --> 1542.48
i have an editor but it just doesn't

1540.559 --> 1544.08
work anymore

1542.48 --> 1547.52
i don't even know if the guy that made

1544.08 --> 1547.52
it if he's still alive

1548.96 --> 1553.039
i don't know

1550.64 --> 1553.8400000000001
but he probably won't help out without

1553.039 --> 1555.84
like

1553.84 --> 1558.24
without me paying in money which i don't

1555.84 --> 1561.279
have i did pay that guy money for that

1558.24 --> 1561.279
website at the time

1561.679 --> 1565.679
right

1563.84 --> 1569.48
but at least like

1565.679 --> 1569.48
it's still all there

1585.919 --> 1589.039
flip flop mr

1587.6 --> 1592.24
hello jose

1589.039 --> 1595.32
no flip flat is his own man i think he's

1592.24 --> 1595.32
a guy

1604.32 --> 1609.12
man yeah i'm feeling way better than

1606.32 --> 1612.72
yesterday instead of like 50

1609.12 --> 1614.559
it's like 25 percent

1612.72 --> 1616.08
so

1614.559 --> 1619.44
helps a lot

1616.08 --> 1619.4399999999998
when it comes to focusing

1622.48 --> 1627.44
anyway yeah seeking star wars

1625.039 --> 1629.2
whenever you want you know no hurry like

1627.44 --> 1631.6000000000001
if you want to do that

1629.2 --> 1635.039
in the summer like in four months or

1631.6 --> 1635.039
something i'm fine with that too

1635.6 --> 1640.039
i'm not in a hurry with such things

1645.76 --> 1650.08
darwin with the holographic nature of

1647.76 --> 1653.52
the sun two marats with three sun

1650.08 --> 1656.1589999999999
speeches are as dark as

1653.52 --> 1660.399
right yeah pichai thinks that it's a

1656.159 --> 1660.3990000000001
reflection of aristarchus pretty much

1666.399 --> 1670.9599999999998
i still think that pha's idea was very

1669.36 --> 1672.1589999999999
interesting like there there is

1670.96 --> 1674.48
something

1672.159 --> 1676.96
like he plucked that story from

1674.48 --> 1676.96
somewhere

1677.039 --> 1680.399
and i've

1678.399 --> 1683.039
heard it before

1680.399 --> 1685.6
it's like his thing of like this big

1683.039 --> 1688.32
tree of life was cut down and then

1685.6 --> 1690.7199999999998
the celestials arrived

1688.32 --> 1693.279
he's not the one that made up that story

1690.72 --> 1694.84
you see he didn't make that up

1693.279 --> 1698.399
that's a thing

1694.84 --> 1701.1999999999998
somewhere from something

1698.399 --> 1703.84
some really old story

1701.2 --> 1706.559
i don't remember where i got it

1703.84 --> 1709.12
but i'm pretty sure he didn't literally

1706.559 --> 1711.52
make that up

1709.12 --> 1712.6399999999999
you might have like heard of it in a

1711.52 --> 1714.24
dream

1712.64 --> 1716.0800000000002
in a vision

1714.24 --> 1718.3990000000001
which might be the same way that i heard

1716.08 --> 1719.279
about it

1718.399 --> 1721.4399999999998
right

1719.279 --> 1724.44
it just never really did anything with

1721.44 --> 1724.44
it

1725.12 --> 1728.12
hmm

1765.279 --> 1768.64
there was something to what

1776.799 --> 1782.399
the rune story

1778.84 --> 1785.36
what is it a rune story

1782.399 --> 1785.36
seeking style water

1786.399 --> 1790.7199999999998
like the aristarchus cutting down the

1788.799 --> 1795.2
tree of life

1790.72 --> 1796.64
and then the celestials came into being

1795.2 --> 1800.64
is that

1796.64 --> 1800.64
is that a room story

1801.039 --> 1805.799
are you talking about something else

1814.72 --> 1820.799
heard someone say the sun was just

1817.12 --> 1823.52
a hole with orange light behind orange

1820.799 --> 1824.72
i don't think orange necessarily

1823.52 --> 1827.12
but

1824.72 --> 1828.0
yeah i've described it like that the

1827.12 --> 1830.4799999999998
well

1828.0 --> 1832.72
the visual of it right

1830.48 --> 1834.48
it did that i think like two weeks ago

1832.72 --> 1837.84
on fed

1834.48 --> 1837.84
or more a month ago i don't know

1838.32 --> 1843.84
where i said like yeah when you look at

1840.559 --> 1846.48
it it is almost like you're looking

1843.84 --> 1846.48
at a hole

1846.88 --> 1851.3600000000001
and through that whole light is coming

1849.039 --> 1853.919
and then when the eclipse

1851.36 --> 1856.4799999999998
solar eclipse happens it's like

1853.919 --> 1859.679
somebody's rolled a boulder

1856.48 --> 1859.679
in front of the hole

1860.48 --> 1865.559
because it it kind of does look like

1862.559 --> 1865.559
that

1867.919 --> 1872.24
right but that's just an impression

1869.76 --> 1875.519
that's just like how

1872.24 --> 1877.279
the eyes and the brain size up the

1875.519 --> 1879.1200000000001
phenomena the holographic phenomena

1877.279 --> 1880.88
doesn't mean that it's literally that

1879.12 --> 1882.2399999999998
it's just like that's kind of what your

1880.88 --> 1884.7990000000002
intuition

1882.24 --> 1886.0
might tell you

1884.799 --> 1891.2
based on

1886.0 --> 1893.76
your automated spatial sizing up ability

1891.2 --> 1898.48
the intermittent process of your brain

1893.76 --> 1900.399
between the actual visual and then your

1898.48 --> 1903.44
the final rendering right there's a

1900.399 --> 1905.36
mechanism in between that tries to help

1903.44 --> 1907.039
you interpret what you're looking at

1905.36 --> 1907.84
spatially

1907.039 --> 1910.1589999999999
and

1907.84 --> 1912.08
that in that system gives me the

1910.159 --> 1913.519
impression like yeah the sun is like a

1912.08 --> 1915.1999999999998
hole

1913.519 --> 1917.1200000000001
a hole in another dimension through

1915.2 --> 1919.519
which that light comes and then solar

1917.12 --> 1920.9599999999998
eclipse is like so a boulders roll

1919.519 --> 1923.279
rolled in front of the hole and that

1920.96 --> 1925.1200000000001
whole thing reminds me

1923.279 --> 1926.64
very much

1925.12 --> 1928.2399999999998
even of

1926.64 --> 1930.3990000000001
uh

1928.24 --> 1933.76
of the story of jesus

1930.399 --> 1936.6399999999999
jesus in golgotha was it

1933.76 --> 1939.519
where he was like put to rest and a big

1936.64 --> 1941.8400000000001
boulder in front of the cave like that's

1939.519 --> 1944.48
literally what that room what a solar

1941.84 --> 1945.4399999999998
eclipse reminds me of which is kind of

1944.48 --> 1947.84
like

1945.44 --> 1951.279
astounding considering there is this

1947.84 --> 1953.519
metaphor of like oh jesus christ the son

1951.279 --> 1953.519
right

1958.32 --> 1962.48
isn't the sun orange no not no emma pio

1961.2 --> 1965.2
it's

1962.48 --> 1968.48
it has different colors it it's

1965.2 --> 1968.48
basically just white

1970.32 --> 1975.6
but when it gets low to the horizon

1974.08 --> 1976.399
then there's all this

1975.6 --> 1979.1999999999998
stuff

1976.399 --> 1982.399
in between thick layers of gas and

1979.2 --> 1984.88
whatever water vapor and then and yeah

1982.399 --> 1987.12
industrial

1984.88 --> 1989.44
waste gases and all that

1987.12 --> 1990.559
and that may cause

1989.44 --> 1992.96
the light

1990.559 --> 1994.48
to basically become

1992.96 --> 1996.24
different from white but it is

1994.48 --> 2000.679
effectively white

1996.24 --> 2000.679
it's just very bright white light

2019.2 --> 2024.64
mostly men are color what

2021.84 --> 2024.6399999999999
that's not true

2024.72 --> 2028.84
but most men are colorblind

2037.039 --> 2042.08
i always thought it was orange well emma

2039.6 --> 2044.559
look there's another effect that might

2042.08 --> 2045.519
give you the impression it's orange

2044.559 --> 2046.559
right

2045.519 --> 2048.8
and that's

2046.559 --> 2051.2
the blue sky

2048.8 --> 2053.2000000000003
right your eyes

2051.2 --> 2055.5989999999997
have a weird contrasting effect i don't

2053.2 --> 2057.839
know if you ever noticed that

2055.599 --> 2059.679
if you're gonna look at one color very

2057.839 --> 2062.0789999999997
bright bright color and you're gonna

2059.679 --> 2064.159
look at

2062.079 --> 2067.3590000000004
like black

2064.159 --> 2069.44
right next to it there is a chance that

2067.359 --> 2072.56
you will get the impression

2069.44 --> 2074.56
like that black is actually

2072.56 --> 2077.7599999999998
let's just say green let's just say

2074.56 --> 2079.599
you're watching at a very bright red

2077.76 --> 2082.48
color and then you're looking at black

2079.599 --> 2084.96
right next to it it's likely that your

2082.48 --> 2086.639
eyes or your brain the intermittent part

2084.96 --> 2088.56
is going to tell you that's actually

2086.639 --> 2094.0
green

2088.56 --> 2094.0
why because that's the opposite of red

2094.56 --> 2097.04
right

2095.44 --> 2099.839
so if you're going to be looking at a

2097.04 --> 2101.68
super clear blue sky and there's this

2099.839 --> 2104.0789999999997
super bright

2101.68 --> 2106.24
light in there

2104.079 --> 2109.04
then because of the color contrast you

2106.24 --> 2111.2
just might start to it might start to

2109.04 --> 2113.04
give you the impression like it's orange

2111.2 --> 2114.96
but that's actually the intermittent

2113.04 --> 2117.119
part of your brain

2114.96 --> 2120.0
in between your eyes

2117.119 --> 2122.2400000000002
and the actual picture you get to see

2120.0 --> 2124.72
kind of telling you like yeah it's

2122.24 --> 2127.72
orange because everything around it is

2124.72 --> 2127.72
blue

2139.839 --> 2144.0
right that's why when it's not a blue

2141.92 --> 2146.56
sky and there's like a lot of clouds

2144.0 --> 2146.56
everywhere

2146.64 --> 2151.5989999999997
but then the sun comes through at some

2148.88 --> 2154.079
point it's not gonna look orange at all

2151.599 --> 2157.28
it's just gonna look white

2154.079 --> 2158.88
because everything around it visually is

2157.28 --> 2160.079
white

2158.88 --> 2163.599
just

2160.079 --> 2165.6800000000003
shades of yeah white to gray

2163.599 --> 2167.44
and then there's no color contrast

2165.68 --> 2169.359
effect

2167.44 --> 2173.16
that's gonna make you give get the

2169.359 --> 2173.16
impression it's orange

2186.32 --> 2188.56
ah

2193.76 --> 2197.3590000000004
wow

2194.8 --> 2201.1600000000003
you get sneezing fits from staring at

2197.359 --> 2201.16
the sun huh

2203.52 --> 2208.079
well i guess if it's like a really

2206.48 --> 2209.68
uh

2208.079 --> 2211.44
heavy

2209.68 --> 2212.839
summer sun right

2211.44 --> 2217.04
and you're like

2212.839 --> 2221.68
somewhat closer to the equator yeah then

2217.04 --> 2221.68
i get it it can be super overwhelming

2222.079 --> 2228.2400000000002
i remember having had sneezing fits too

2225.92 --> 2230.48
like in the summer in spain during

2228.24 --> 2232.16
vacations with my parents and all that

2230.48 --> 2234.0
and then it would be like so freaking

2232.16 --> 2235.92
bright and if i then actually stare at

2234.0 --> 2238.0
it i would indeed like get a sneezing

2235.92 --> 2240.0
fit and it's weird how that works

2238.0 --> 2243.32
but it's only when it's like really

2240.0 --> 2243.32
really bright

2246.8 --> 2252.32
like when there's like this heavy winter

2249.2 --> 2255.4399999999996
sun or like not winterson late winter

2252.32 --> 2257.3590000000004
like there was a lot of it in january

2255.44 --> 2259.2000000000003
where the sun like it was cold but then

2257.359 --> 2262.7999999999997
the sun was like so

2259.2 --> 2265.7599999999998
so bright it's like painful

2262.8 --> 2268.0
yeah that kind of brightness that

2265.76 --> 2272.2400000000002
that would typically

2268.0 --> 2272.24
tend to trigger sneezing yeah

2274.0 --> 2277.64
so you're not alone

2284.56 --> 2289.4
why does it make you sneeze i don't

2286.16 --> 2289.3999999999996
really know

2304.56 --> 2309.359
all right flip flat

2306.8 --> 2311.28
i don't really like sungazing

2309.359 --> 2313.359
oh unless it's with my eyes closed

2311.28 --> 2315.8390000000004
because i don't i don't actually stare

2313.359 --> 2318.64
in this into the sun

2315.839 --> 2318.64
i don't do that

2322.64 --> 2327.839
but i definitely face the sun

2325.119 --> 2327.839
do like that

2328.88 --> 2332.8
right

2329.92 --> 2335.359
as long as just some of that direct

2332.8 --> 2337.52
light eventually

2335.359 --> 2340.48
like goes through

2337.52 --> 2343.44
the soft tissue of your like light goes

2340.48 --> 2344.72
right through your eyeballs right

2343.44 --> 2347.119
just because

2344.72 --> 2348.9599999999996
at the back of your eye it is absorbed

2347.119 --> 2350.4
and registered doesn't mean that like

2348.96 --> 2353.359
really bright light it's basically going

2350.4 --> 2357.28
to go right through you

2353.359 --> 2359.7599999999998
in in ways so yeah if you face the sun

2357.28 --> 2362.0
insert like with chin up

2359.76 --> 2363.76
you can literally have even with your

2362.0 --> 2365.04
eyes closed have

2363.76 --> 2368.5600000000004
that light

2365.04 --> 2369.68
shine onto your pineal gland or

2368.56 --> 2370.56
almost

2369.68 --> 2374.16
like

2370.56 --> 2376.0789999999997
it works something happens

2374.16 --> 2378.8799999999997
but i don't like to basically burn out

2376.079 --> 2378.88
my retinas

2379.119 --> 2382.96
like i mean

2380.24 --> 2384.3199999999997
yeah it would probably restore i'm just

2382.96 --> 2387.28
like

2384.32 --> 2389.2000000000003
really happy with the quality of my eyes

2387.28 --> 2392.6400000000003
because they're really good eyes they're

2389.2 --> 2397.2
really good like i don't need glasses

2392.64 --> 2399.44
right i'm 40 42 i don't need glasses

2397.2 --> 2402.3999999999996
both my parents

2399.44 --> 2402.4
needed glasses

2404.4 --> 2409.76
i don't

2406.24 --> 2412.9599999999996
and i'm like really like oh

2409.76 --> 2412.96
careful with my eyes

2414.64 --> 2419.2799999999997
so yeah i don't want to stare into the

2416.319 --> 2421.2799999999997
sun with open eyes

2419.28 --> 2422.8390000000004
but i guess for some people that works

2421.28 --> 2426.0
fine and they don't

2422.839 --> 2429.72
like they don't get like black spots

2426.0 --> 2429.72
that won't go away

2440.24 --> 2443.04
you will with h

2442.079 --> 2444.88
no

2443.04 --> 2447.7599999999998
no

2444.88 --> 2449.92
i reject that

2447.76 --> 2452.92
okay i just i absolutely reject that

2449.92 --> 2452.92
notion

2453.68 --> 2458.56
right what actually goes

2456.24 --> 2458.56
is

2459.68 --> 2464.96
the the automated ease with which you

2462.8 --> 2468.7200000000003
use your eye muscles

2464.96 --> 2470.88
right because your eyes have muscles

2468.72 --> 2472.64
you didn't know that yeah they do they

2470.88 --> 2474.56
have muscles

2472.64 --> 2476.8799999999997
and if you don't

2474.56 --> 2479.2799999999997
if you like abuse those

2476.88 --> 2481.359
or you don't train them enough you get

2479.28 --> 2483.0400000000004
eye issues that's why most people get

2481.359 --> 2485.7599999999998
glasses

2483.04 --> 2488.0
it's because they're having focus issues

2485.76 --> 2488.0
right

2489.599 --> 2494.4
it's not because literally like they're

2491.92 --> 2496.64
resolute there's like dark pixels or

2494.4 --> 2498.1600000000003
something like on a monitor right

2496.64 --> 2500.48
that's not that's

2498.16 --> 2504.16
very rare

2500.48 --> 2506.319
no it's the eye muscles that get issues

2504.16 --> 2508.72
you can train those

2506.319 --> 2511.04
yeah you don't have to

2508.72 --> 2513.52
surrender oh you get old and then you

2511.04 --> 2516.079
lose it all no

2513.52 --> 2517.839
you lose what you don't use

2516.079 --> 2519.44
if you don't know you have it you're not

2517.839 --> 2522.7599999999998
going to use it and then you're going to

2519.44 --> 2522.76
lose it

2528.56 --> 2534.56
ice

2530.88 --> 2536.6400000000003
can change which age

2534.56 --> 2538.96
huh

2536.64 --> 2538.96
okay

2539.359 --> 2545.48
well that depends then on the the

2542.48 --> 2545.48
heritage

2558.88 --> 2564.2400000000002
this is a well-known fact oh ask a

2561.04 --> 2564.24
doctor okay

2571.599 --> 2574.839
of course

2582.64 --> 2589.1189999999997
well what about if i don't do that

2586.16 --> 2590.72
and i just pay attention to for example

2589.119 --> 2593.6800000000003
my dad

2590.72 --> 2596.72
a very similar type of eyes

2593.68 --> 2598.72
he has glasses but why

2596.72 --> 2601.4399999999996
why does he have glasses

2598.72 --> 2604.0
focus issues not

2601.44 --> 2607.2000000000003
because the quality of the vision is

2604.0 --> 2610.079
actually decreased

2607.2 --> 2613.9199999999996
sees just as much

2610.079 --> 2616.48
as he would have like 40 50 years ago

2613.92 --> 2618.4
except now he just has trouble focusing

2616.48 --> 2623.119
like his trouble reading so has to put

2618.4 --> 2626.0
glasses on right muscle issues not

2623.119 --> 2629.0
not visual quality

2626.0 --> 2629.0
right

2641.119 --> 2643.92
are you the youngest i don't know how

2642.64 --> 2645.44
old are you

2643.92 --> 2649.28
mp1

2645.44 --> 2652.8
probably there's a lot of uh

2649.28 --> 2654.7200000000003
people in their 50s here i think

2652.8 --> 2657.3590000000004
and that's perfectly fine i've always

2654.72 --> 2661.0789999999997
liked people in their 50s those actually

2657.359 --> 2661.0789999999997
freaking pay attention

2663.52 --> 2666.52
hmm

2679.28 --> 2684.96
long distance vision yes right

2682.4 --> 2684.96
that's right

2686.48 --> 2690.88
it's all about what are you doing with

2688.72 --> 2693.7599999999998
your eyes right

2690.88 --> 2696.56
are you like constantly reading

2693.76 --> 2698.88
a book or paper right in front of you

2696.56 --> 2701.599
like most people read very close to

2698.88 --> 2703.28
their eyes right

2701.599 --> 2705.76
that means you're going to be burdening

2703.28 --> 2708.3190000000004
very specific type of muscles in your

2705.76 --> 2709.76
eyes constantly

2708.319 --> 2711.04
right

2709.76 --> 2714.48
now if you

2711.04 --> 2714.48
don't overburden them

2716.72 --> 2722.0789999999997
then you'll have absolutely no issues

2719.28 --> 2724.4
looking into the far distance

2722.079 --> 2726.2400000000002
i like looking into the far distance i

2724.4 --> 2727.92
really like this

2726.24 --> 2729.52
view

2727.92 --> 2733.839
gives me a lot of opportunity to

2729.52 --> 2733.839
basically look into the distance

2734.24 --> 2738.9599999999996
but also

2735.44 --> 2741.52
with my computer screens and before all

2738.96 --> 2744.079
this televisions

2741.52 --> 2746.16
always had like my parents when i was a

2744.079 --> 2748.7200000000003
kid were always telling me don't sit too

2746.16 --> 2750.24
freaking close to the television

2748.72 --> 2752.72
and at first they kind of said it's

2750.24 --> 2754.3999999999996
because of the radiation danger it's

2752.72 --> 2756.8799999999997
really bad for you

2754.4 --> 2758.7200000000003
you could get skin cancer right but

2756.88 --> 2761.359
later

2758.72 --> 2763.68
turns out that it also just has eye

2761.359 --> 2765.839
focus issues if you constantly

2763.68 --> 2768.24
focus on something that's very close to

2765.839 --> 2769.92
you like as if you were reading a book i

2768.24 --> 2772.24
don't like reading books

2769.92 --> 2775.839
i don't like doing that

2772.24 --> 2775.839
always tire my eyes

2776.24 --> 2781.359
but even with screens if you sit too

2779.04 --> 2783.68
close to what you're observing you're

2781.359 --> 2786.319
focusing very close by a lot

2783.68 --> 2787.5989999999997
it's gonna like be very tiresome on your

2786.319 --> 2791.52
eyes

2787.599 --> 2794.1600000000003
and it's not like your eye muscles

2791.52 --> 2797.52
improve a lot like

2794.16 --> 2797.52
like your limb muscles

2799.2 --> 2803.52
i mean they improve some but i mean

2801.599 --> 2805.44
there's not a lot of you're not going to

2803.52 --> 2806.8
bulk up your eye muscles if you know

2805.44 --> 2808.079
what i mean

2806.8 --> 2809.6800000000003
you know

2808.079 --> 2810.88
i don't know maybe

2809.68 --> 2814.0
what the [ __ ]

2810.88 --> 2816.56
maybe there's a way to beef them up

2814.0 --> 2818.96
i i don't recommend it

2816.56 --> 2821.839
it's just

2818.96 --> 2826.599
learn to read at a distance

2821.839 --> 2826.599
it's better for you on the long run

2857.44 --> 2861.68
all of them flies on the windscreen

2861.839 --> 2867.319
uh yeah well you have to keep that clean

2864.319 --> 2867.319
sure

2874.8 --> 2879.8390000000004
go to the igem right

2877.2 --> 2882.7999999999997
i think that's called a library

2879.839 --> 2887.119
but they don't have like

2882.8 --> 2890.319
library instructors and how to like

2887.119 --> 2894.2400000000002
spot your position and

2890.319 --> 2894.24
help you train your eye muscles though

2894.72 --> 2899.24
you're just gonna have to figure it out

2896.24 --> 2899.24
yourself

2908.0 --> 2913.839
drive a lot use my computers a lot

2911.359 --> 2916.4
now driving is not not gonna be bad for

2913.839 --> 2916.4
your eyes

2920.88 --> 2925.52
i don't get that at all

2923.04 --> 2928.079
right like what's bad for your eyes is

2925.52 --> 2930.24
if you like

2928.079 --> 2932.88
drive in a car with a

2930.24 --> 2934.72
open roof and you get a freaking bug

2932.88 --> 2936.8
flying in your eye right that can

2934.72 --> 2938.319
actually seriously

2936.8 --> 2939.52
damage

2938.319 --> 2943.5589999999997
your eye

2939.52 --> 2943.559
you got to be careful with that

2945.2 --> 2950.16
and with computers

2946.8 --> 2950.1600000000003
just make sure that

2950.8 --> 2954.96
this is a personal tip

2952.96 --> 2956.88
i think it's very legitimate

2954.96 --> 2958.48
like don't

2956.88 --> 2961.119
go

2958.48 --> 2963.2
stare at a screen

2961.119 --> 2965.359
especially from close by

2963.2 --> 2967.68
with a really dark room around you make

2965.359 --> 2969.7599999999998
sure that if you have a computer screen

2967.68 --> 2972.8799999999997
in the evening or in the night you're

2969.76 --> 2974.3190000000004
always going to have other lights on

2972.88 --> 2976.7200000000003
surrounding it

2974.319 --> 2979.839
because actually staring at a singular

2976.72 --> 2981.359
screen with all dark around it that's

2979.839 --> 2984.7599999999998
really bad

2981.359 --> 2984.7599999999998
for your eyes

2987.359 --> 2993.2799999999997
i used to do that as a kid and it would

2990.4 --> 2996.2400000000002
literally just give me headaches

2993.28 --> 2998.4
for hours and hours after that

2996.24 --> 3000.8799999999997
or the next day

2998.4 --> 3002.8
then it just couldn't focus anymore

3000.88 --> 3004.48
so always make sure that if you're gonna

3002.8 --> 3007.2000000000003
have if you're gonna be staring at a

3004.48 --> 3009.52
computer screen for whatever

3007.2 --> 3010.8799999999997
for work or even just watching videos

3009.52 --> 3015.44
make sure

3010.88 --> 3015.44
there's light surrounding it all

3016.0 --> 3020.96
so that the computer

3018.079 --> 3023.119
screen light is not the only light that

3020.96 --> 3024.4
comes in because that's really bad for

3023.119 --> 3027.359
you

3024.4 --> 3030.1600000000003
i i can't even like directly say the

3027.359 --> 3033.2
physical process that makes it bad i

3030.16 --> 3035.92
just know from experience is bad

3033.2 --> 3038.72
right and not just with

3035.92 --> 3041.44
with like the old glass tube televisions

3038.72 --> 3044.16
which were said to have radiation but

3041.44 --> 3047.28
with even with modern screens

3044.16 --> 3050.64
even with the freaking mobile like don't

3047.28 --> 3053.52
have don't sit in the dark staring at

3050.64 --> 3057.68
your mobile that's really bad it's

3053.52 --> 3057.68
really really bad for your eyes

3062.079 --> 3066.8390000000004
don't do that

3064.24 --> 3069.68
like really don't it's

3066.839 --> 3071.68
bad and some people have a habit of

3069.68 --> 3073.359
doing that i know

3071.68 --> 3075.839
it's like oh i got into bed and then

3073.359 --> 3079.2799999999997
like ah restless i'm gonna just watch a

3075.839 --> 3082.48
movie or something in the in the dark

3079.28 --> 3085.48
that's really bad for your eyes don't do

3082.48 --> 3085.48
that

3103.599 --> 3106.6400000000003
night time setting

3107.2 --> 3112.16
i hate those

3109.04 --> 3115.119
i don't like nighttime settings

3112.16 --> 3117.839
just have a light on

3115.119 --> 3117.839
very simple

3121.28 --> 3125.8390000000004
right for me it's kind of critical

3127.52 --> 3131.7599999999998
to have a computer screen

3129.839 --> 3132.96
with a white

3131.76 --> 3135.28
background

3132.96 --> 3137.92
like not in the screen but literally

3135.28 --> 3139.119
behind it the wall behind my monitor is

3137.92 --> 3141.28
white

3139.119 --> 3143.44
very helpful

3141.28 --> 3145.6800000000003
because that means that a lot of lights

3143.44 --> 3148.4
gonna scatter there

3145.68 --> 3152.16
it's never gonna be just me accidentally

3148.4 --> 3153.839
getting focused in on like this once on

3152.16 --> 3155.5989999999997
this square

3153.839 --> 3158.96
because there is other

3155.599 --> 3161.3590000000004
things always surrounding it visually

3158.96 --> 3161.359
anyway

3162.72 --> 3166.5589999999997
that great eyes yeah that's really nice

3164.88 --> 3169.359
gadget inspector

3166.559 --> 3171.599
yeah don't project your

3169.359 --> 3174.0789999999997
your

3171.599 --> 3174.079
what is it

3174.16 --> 3178.24
your ocular degeneration onto me thank

3176.96 --> 3180.8
you very much

3178.24 --> 3183.359
my eyes work fine i'm gonna take great

3180.8 --> 3183.3590000000004
care of them

3189.04 --> 3192.8
and

3190.16 --> 3196.5589999999997
i will pretty much ensure that i'm never

3192.8 --> 3197.92
gonna ever need to wear glasses

3196.559 --> 3200.559
and i'm always going to be testing

3197.92 --> 3202.2400000000002
myself oh is it a clear day oh how far

3200.559 --> 3205.3590000000004
can i see

3202.24 --> 3207.04
still remember as a kid i was like 17 or

3205.359 --> 3208.4
something

3207.04 --> 3209.839
i was standing at

3208.4 --> 3212.8
on the beach

3209.839 --> 3214.7999999999997
in spain on the

3212.8 --> 3216.96
on the northern

3214.8 --> 3219.92
northeast coast

3216.96 --> 3222.4
and i could literally watch on the beach

3219.92 --> 3226.0
which was confirmedly like

3222.4 --> 3228.7200000000003
three or four kilometers away

3226.0 --> 3231.76
or more could be more could be ten i

3228.72 --> 3234.7999999999997
don't know very it was like really small

3231.76 --> 3237.28
but it could still make out the color of

3234.8 --> 3239.44
the shirts

3237.28 --> 3242.2400000000002
people were wearing walking on that

3239.44 --> 3244.88
beach okay

3242.24 --> 3244.8799999999997
good eyes

3247.28 --> 3249.599
and

3248.319 --> 3252.4
yeah i'm

3249.599 --> 3256.2400000000002
i really want to retain that ability and

3252.4 --> 3258.2400000000002
i can still make out a lot of detail a

3256.24 --> 3260.0
lot of great detail at fast fast

3258.24 --> 3262.64
distances

3260.0 --> 3265.44
i mean i have really good eyes

3262.64 --> 3267.68
and i'm very happy about that

3265.44 --> 3270.8
and i will do my best to

3267.68 --> 3273.7999999999997
keep them good for as long as i humanly

3270.8 --> 3273.8
can

3295.68 --> 3301.16
hi random explorer yeah it's good to

3298.16 --> 3301.16
hear

3306.64 --> 3310.5589999999997
block the blue hmm

3308.799 --> 3312.4
i've heard of that

3310.559 --> 3314.559
i've heard of that random explorer that

3312.4 --> 3318.28
there are special glasses yeah i don't i

3314.559 --> 3318.28
just don't wear glasses

3320.0 --> 3325.72
i think yeah they would make me look

3321.68 --> 3325.72
like a total nerd anyway

3352.88 --> 3357.76
no risk of blindness from yeah yeah

3355.119 --> 3357.76
that's cute

3362.16 --> 3366.48
still not gonna do it though

3365.28 --> 3369.0400000000004
i don't like

3366.48 --> 3370.96
spots on my retinas

3369.04 --> 3372.88
that last for hours and hours i just

3370.96 --> 3376.599
don't like doing that

3372.88 --> 3376.599
i don't see the point

3403.119 --> 3405.599
30 miles

3404.64 --> 3408.0789999999997
40

3405.599 --> 3411.52
34 miles

3408.079 --> 3415.2000000000003
that's yeah that's quite a distance

3411.52 --> 3416.88
but yeah making out buildings

3415.2 --> 3419.839
it's pretty cool though

3416.88 --> 3419.839
but yeah

3422.28 --> 3428.48
289 i don't know how tall is that i just

3425.92 --> 3430.559
i hate feet

3428.48 --> 3434.599
measure like i don't know

3430.559 --> 3434.599
let's just say meters

3447.88 --> 3450.9790000000003
[Applause]

3455.44 --> 3460.04
88 meters

3457.04 --> 3460.04
okay

3460.96 --> 3463.52
88

3463.92 --> 3468.48
wow that's that's pretty good with the

3465.839 --> 3468.48
naked eye

3471.04 --> 3476.5589999999997
must have been a really clear day though

3473.839 --> 3480.2
usually at that distance things kind of

3476.559 --> 3480.2000000000003
blur up a bit

3504.72 --> 3508.799
what that's the opposite of what they

3506.96 --> 3511.799
say in the usa what

3508.799 --> 3511.799
what

3537.76 --> 3540.76
hmm

3553.839 --> 3558.599
uh that's the

3555.119 --> 3558.599
well they're idiots

3560.48 --> 3563.76
i mean i'm kind of fine with

3562.96 --> 3566.96
like

3563.76 --> 3568.88
length of a person right

3566.96 --> 3570.88
then inches feet

3568.88 --> 3572.96
like on the small scale i think that

3570.88 --> 3575.119
works fine but

3572.96 --> 3577.68
when it's like with really large things

3575.119 --> 3580.4
i think that feet is incredibly

3577.68 --> 3580.3999999999996
confusing

3581.76 --> 3586.4
i'd much rather just use metrics because

3584.799 --> 3589.04
then it's like

3586.4 --> 3592.28
very straight forward

3589.04 --> 3592.2799999999997
to me

3606.48 --> 3609.48
um

3622.079 --> 3625.2000000000003
that's right i'm appeal

3626.16 --> 3631.44
i'm i'm perfectly metric but i basically

3629.04 --> 3634.5589999999997
had to learn

3631.44 --> 3635.599
like how much a feet

3634.559 --> 3636.559
foot

3635.599 --> 3640.96
based

3636.559 --> 3642.799
metrics or yeah measurement system

3640.96 --> 3644.319
also thanks to d and d

3642.799 --> 3646.96
which might

3644.319 --> 3649.2
use freaking feet

3646.96 --> 3652.48
it's called a five foot square

3649.2 --> 3654.16
that's like literally the the metrics of

3652.48 --> 3656.2400000000002
d and d

3654.16 --> 3658.48
in combat

3656.24 --> 3659.4399999999996
everything is in feet so i had to learn

3658.48 --> 3662.64
feet

3659.44 --> 3666.68
it's just that when it comes really big

3662.64 --> 3666.68
i completely lose track

3676.24 --> 3681.9599999999996
i think i'll probably get better at it

3678.16 --> 3681.96
though over time

3685.44 --> 3691.92
i mean the rough formula

3688.88 --> 3694.559
that i basically had

3691.92 --> 3694.559
is that

3694.96 --> 3698.48
10 foot

3696.559 --> 3701.76
is

3698.48 --> 3701.76
three meters roughly

3701.839 --> 3706.5589999999997
and i got that from

3703.68 --> 3708.0789999999997
yeah working with the dnd game board a

3706.559 --> 3710.1600000000003
lot

3708.079 --> 3711.8390000000004
and that's for like how i roughly size

3710.16 --> 3714.3999999999996
it up internally

3711.839 --> 3715.52
of course it's not precise but it's good

3714.4 --> 3719.64
enough

3715.52 --> 3719.64
it's close enough to me

3752.48 --> 3755.839
hey flatter sage

3779.76 --> 3782.76
hmm

3797.76 --> 3800.76
uh

3812.799 --> 3815.799
um

3839.44 --> 3846.4
how's my job better than yesterday but

3841.68 --> 3846.3999999999996
yeah after a while after talking a lot

3846.72 --> 3852.16
it is getting kind of sore again a bit

3849.599 --> 3856.2400000000002
but this is only to be expected it's

3852.16 --> 3856.24
it's it's still fine what

3857.039 --> 3861.0
no sound is not gone

3890.72 --> 3895.2799999999997
oh by the way thanks rick beck i don't

3893.039 --> 3897.76
know if you were in chat

3895.28 --> 3899.76
he gave me paypal last

3897.76 --> 3902.2400000000002
night like he said he would thank you

3899.76 --> 3904.079
very much for that

3902.24 --> 3906.0
that means that i will be able to eat

3904.079 --> 3909.3590000000004
this monday

3906.0 --> 3911.28
that makes me happy i could definitely

3909.359 --> 3913.2
use more support though from anybody

3911.28 --> 3915.8390000000004
that can

3913.2 --> 3915.839
support me

3921.2 --> 3926.319
so yeah if you if you have

3924.0 --> 3928.559
if you have available please donate to

3926.319 --> 3929.92
my paypal it's in the description box

3928.559 --> 3934.28
below

3929.92 --> 3934.28
i think a lot of you already know

3959.68 --> 3962.68
hmm

3982.4 --> 3984.7200000000003
hmm

3988.24 --> 3994.0
changing to summertime at the end of the

3990.4 --> 3996.7200000000003
month really is that gonna happen again

3994.0 --> 3996.72
i thought that was

3997.2 --> 3999.4399999999996
hmm

4000.24 --> 4004.0789999999997
right

4001.28 --> 4004.079
yeah it's during

4004.64 --> 4010.16
spring and autumn right

4007.039 --> 4010.1600000000003
yeah okay makes sense

4010.96 --> 4014.64
we'll see

4012.88 --> 4017.359
and then i guess we're all gonna have to

4014.64 --> 4020.839
get up a little earlier

4017.359 --> 4020.839
but that's great

4021.2 --> 4026.0
because the sun gets up earlier anyway

4026.64 --> 4030.16
today new time

4028.88 --> 4031.119
today

4030.16 --> 4034.44
really

4031.119 --> 4034.44
is that today

4046.079 --> 4049.079
right

4076.16 --> 4079.16
hmm

4100.96 --> 4105.839
yeah yeah me too mfp i kind of like it

4103.44 --> 4105.839
too

4106.48 --> 4109.678999999999
because

4107.759 --> 4112.48
it basically

4109.679 --> 4113.759
people that are on autopilot with time

4112.48 --> 4116.5599999999995
schedules

4113.759 --> 4120.64
is kind of forcing them to basically get

4116.56 --> 4120.64
up earlier and get more of the sun

4122.799 --> 4126.319
right that's what it's really for the

4124.799 --> 4128.239
the time

4126.319 --> 4132.839000000001
shift

4128.239 --> 4132.839
to get more of the sun

4161.6 --> 4164.6
uh

4191.759 --> 4194.759
hmm

4225.92 --> 4230.0
there's no point with all the new

4227.6 --> 4231.76
systems they have well get your spectre

4230.0 --> 4234.64
no there's still the psychological

4231.76 --> 4238.64
influence of having more sun

4234.64 --> 4238.64
it's not just energy saving

4240.0 --> 4243.12
right but

4241.52 --> 4247.6
yeah

4243.12 --> 4249.12
it is a bit confusing as an alternative

4247.6 --> 4251.120000000001
although i don't know if that would

4249.12 --> 4253.12
actually work out in

4251.12 --> 4255.679
in practice

4253.12 --> 4259.04
what could also be done

4255.679 --> 4261.679
is just get rid of the time change

4259.04 --> 4264.56
but then instead

4261.679 --> 4266.4
make it into a time policy

4264.56 --> 4268.719
where it's just like okay well during

4266.4 --> 4273.28
this time

4268.719 --> 4275.28
companies can decide to just all

4273.28 --> 4278.32
uh yeah

4275.28 --> 4280.719
you get to work an hour earlier

4278.32 --> 4283.28
or later and we just do it like that

4280.719 --> 4284.4800000000005
right so that it can be dependent on

4283.28 --> 4286.48
like the

4284.48 --> 4288.718999999999
the organization whether that's going to

4286.48 --> 4290.799999999999
happen or not

4288.719 --> 4293.36
but i think that that's probably going

4290.8 --> 4294.96
to just cause more division

4293.36 --> 4297.04
because then it's like oh these come

4294.96 --> 4299.28
this company oh you're an hour earlier

4297.04 --> 4301.76
oh you closed an hour earlier but yeah

4299.28 --> 4304.32
the company that i work with doesn't so

4301.76 --> 4306.719
then gets like if it's just a free

4304.32 --> 4309.5199999999995
choice based thing that it's gonna get

4306.719 --> 4309.52
it probably

4310.4 --> 4316.239
more confusing at least on the short run

4312.8 --> 4316.2390000000005
but you could do it like that

4317.12 --> 4321.92
then there's no more time confusion but

4319.28 --> 4324.4
it would just be a policy

4321.92 --> 4324.4
system

4324.56 --> 4329.92
so that companies can decide okay it's

4327.199 --> 4331.678999999999
this time of the year we're gonna switch

4329.92 --> 4335.4400000000005
to

4331.679 --> 4335.4400000000005
doing everything an hour earlier

4336.0 --> 4341.28
or not if they decide not to right

4339.12 --> 4343.5199999999995
because would absolutely take the

4341.28 --> 4346.88
obligation out of it

4343.52 --> 4350.159000000001
because if you literally switch time

4346.88 --> 4352.0
that kind of legally obligates

4350.159 --> 4354.239
companies and everything to go along

4352.0 --> 4357.36
with that because like all the time it's

4354.239 --> 4359.04
just changed the convention itself is

4357.36 --> 4362.239
shifted there's nothing there's nothing

4359.04 --> 4362.239
much you could do about that

4362.719 --> 4367.12
and if you take that away then it would

4364.64 --> 4369.12
be left to like okay

4367.12 --> 4372.5599999999995
is a company gonna

4369.12 --> 4374.96
utilize a policy where they

4372.56 --> 4376.56
just make everybody come to work an hour

4374.96 --> 4380.0
earlier during

4376.56 --> 4381.1990000000005
during the summer half of the year

4380.0 --> 4383.92
right

4381.199 --> 4386.0
and then do it like that but then again

4383.92 --> 4388.159
yeah then you get synchronization issues

4386.0 --> 4390.64
like oh this company does that oh the

4388.159 --> 4392.719
other one does it oh

4390.64 --> 4395.4400000000005
so you get instead of time confusion

4392.719 --> 4397.84
like oh you're an hour earlier over

4395.44 --> 4400.32
there in europe

4397.84 --> 4402.8
like oh yeah i don't know why it's

4400.32 --> 4405.199
different well you're gonna get that

4402.8 --> 4406.96
basically on a much tighter scale where

4405.199 --> 4409.759999999999
literal corporations that might be

4406.96 --> 4411.6
working right next to one another

4409.76 --> 4413.52
don't match anymore because of the

4411.6 --> 4417.719
different policies right that problem

4413.52 --> 4417.719
would then roll out of that

4445.12 --> 4452.0
if i had a bitcoin or xmr address

4449.84 --> 4455.84
i do have a bitcoin address actually

4452.0 --> 4455.84
lumpy gas in a vacuum but

4457.76 --> 4463.04
i don't think it's like secure

4461.12 --> 4465.28
i've actually been considering just

4463.04 --> 4468.48
taking the links out

4465.28 --> 4471.199
or did i actually take them out i think

4468.48 --> 4473.599999999999
i've already done that yeah i still say

4471.199 --> 4473.599999999999
it though

4474.96 --> 4480.4800000000005
i've got it automated in my intro but

4478.4 --> 4484.5599999999995
yeah i technically don't have the the

4480.48 --> 4484.5599999999995
bitcoin link in there anymore

4484.719 --> 4491.04
it's not secure at the moment

4487.04 --> 4491.04
so i really appreciate the

4492.32 --> 4497.12
the gesture lumpy gas in the vacuum but

4494.88 --> 4498.719
yeah if you could just hold on to it for

4497.12 --> 4501.84
a while

4498.719 --> 4501.84
and then maybe later

4503.12 --> 4510.12
look for the address it's not there

4506.239 --> 4510.12
yeah i took it out

4527.44 --> 4531.759999999999
like i

4529.199 --> 4533.919999999999
i'm not even sure as to where exactly

4531.76 --> 4537.6
those links lead to you see i still have

4533.92 --> 4539.4400000000005
them saved in a in a text file somewhere

4537.6 --> 4542.4400000000005
but like i'm i've become a bit

4539.44 --> 4542.44
disoriented

4543.36 --> 4548.639999999999
with all of it

4544.64 --> 4548.64
so many things had changed since

4551.36 --> 4558.36
i would have to double check some things

4553.679 --> 4558.36
before i basically put it back

4566.239 --> 4569.239
um

4601.12 --> 4604.12
hmm

4613.92 --> 4619.4400000000005
that's so typical

4616.8 --> 4623.1990000000005
you said your mom used to set your alarm

4619.44 --> 4625.839999999999
clock 20 minutes ahead to not be late

4623.199 --> 4629.28
i used to do that too a lot i actually

4625.84 --> 4633.6
had that sort of done with my phone

4629.28 --> 4633.599999999999
as in i didn't change the time on it

4633.76 --> 4639.280000000001
when winter came

4637.04 --> 4641.28
i just left it at is but i did

4639.28 --> 4643.44
eventually change it back to normal

4641.28 --> 4646.4
again and then just put my alarm clock

4643.44 --> 4646.4
an hour earlier

4649.36 --> 4654.08
but yeah it's a really easy habit

4652.08 --> 4657.76
to fall into i used to do that all the

4654.08 --> 4657.76
time i always had my clock wrong

4658.239 --> 4664.5599999999995
so that when i would look at it

4661.199 --> 4667.678999999999
i wouldn't yeah because i would just

4664.56 --> 4669.4400000000005
always in my mind downplay how much

4667.679 --> 4672.159
time it actually took

4669.44 --> 4675.44
to like get where i needed to be

4672.159 --> 4677.599999999999
i would always size it up as

4675.44 --> 4679.839999999999
needing too little i was basically kind

4677.6 --> 4682.719
of silly like that

4679.84 --> 4685.28
i would just normally expect myself to

4682.719 --> 4686.88
sprint everywhere just to be on time

4685.28 --> 4689.12
which is ridiculous

4686.88 --> 4692.2390000000005
but it just couldn't match it

4689.12 --> 4693.36
a lot of trouble is matching that so

4692.239 --> 4695.199
then i just

4693.36 --> 4696.719
put my alarm clock early and i think

4695.199 --> 4698.719
like oh

4696.719 --> 4700.159
i got five more minutes to get there oh

4698.719 --> 4704.159
i could do that

4700.159 --> 4706.4
but i actually would need 20 minutes

4704.159 --> 4710.719
and that way the tricking myself would

4706.4 --> 4710.719
actually worry it would work i mean

4712.08 --> 4716.159
it's really weird how that is how that

4713.92 --> 4720.92
functions i but i i don't do that

4716.159 --> 4720.92
anymore though i don't really need to

4740.4 --> 4743.4
so

4760.0 --> 4763.0
hmm

4778.0 --> 4781.88
hey nathera wallace

4800.8 --> 4809.2390000000005
it's eaten alive by bugs yeah you gotta

4803.52 --> 4809.2390000000005
be careful with the swampy places there

4834.8 --> 4837.8
ugh

4853.52 --> 4857.52
yeah i might be like i can't imagine

4855.52 --> 4859.280000000001
that

4857.52 --> 4862.159000000001
like me

4859.28 --> 4865.759999999999
and my parents like one time

4862.159 --> 4868.32
went a bit off-road in southern france

4865.76 --> 4870.159000000001
and then we just ended up trying to camp

4868.32 --> 4872.719
somewhere in the wild

4870.159 --> 4876.48
but yeah that kind of was like right

4872.719 --> 4878.08
next to a sort of a swampy

4876.48 --> 4881.839999999999
area

4878.08 --> 4881.84
and we were like ah

4882.32 --> 4885.28
like

4883.36 --> 4887.36
mosquito nightmare

4885.28 --> 4889.84
so yeah we never did that again after

4887.36 --> 4889.839999999999
that time

4911.199 --> 4914.239
in the first movie

4915.199 --> 4920.599999999999
scientists going to the moon yeah i

4916.88 --> 4920.6
think i've seen that

4931.44 --> 4935.199
it's like a silent movie right

4935.6 --> 4939.84
with sort of clay

4937.679 --> 4943.88
the clay moon where they basically shoot

4939.84 --> 4943.88
a giant bullet in it

4952.56 --> 4955.56
hmm

4968.639 --> 4971.639
what

4974.88 --> 4981.04
why was the teapot a thumbs up

4977.04 --> 4981.04
held for review what was it

4983.6 --> 4987.280000000001
weird

4984.48 --> 4988.799999999999
i don't know man i don't understand

4987.28 --> 4991.36
youtube

4988.8 --> 4993.92
like the auto things i don't really

4991.36 --> 4995.12
understand how that works

4993.92 --> 4999.4
why it

4995.12 --> 4999.4
holds things for review right

5006.719 --> 5011.4800000000005
secret symbols of the teapot society

5015.84 --> 5019.32
sounds british

5047.44 --> 5051.839999999999
oh anybody want to see what youtube

5049.6 --> 5054.400000000001
actually

5051.84 --> 5057.84
gave me in the news

5054.4 --> 5057.839999999999
in youtube studio today

5059.28 --> 5063.5599999999995
this is something completely different

5074.32 --> 5077.599999999999
it's so

5076.4 --> 5079.199
the [ __ ]

5077.6 --> 5082.4800000000005
right so yeah

5079.199 --> 5082.48
this is what appeared to be

5082.84 --> 5088.32
today more specifically what

5085.92 --> 5091.56
what are you looking right at there at

5088.32 --> 5091.5599999999995
the right

5102.159 --> 5107.96
maybe it's for the better that you can

5103.92 --> 5107.96
really see it all that clearly

5118.639 --> 5124.400000000001
right anyway yeah because there was a

5121.04 --> 5124.4
freaking bearded lady

5124.96 --> 5129.12
it's like oh

5126.88 --> 5131.679
celebrate your fans with

5129.12 --> 5135.8
hashtag love notes

5131.679 --> 5135.8
really really youtube

5152.0 --> 5156.56
couldn't read yeah it wasn't really

5153.679 --> 5159.04
about it was the freaking picture man

5156.56 --> 5162.84
that picture

5159.04 --> 5162.84
like what the [ __ ]

5168.719 --> 5173.12
i prefer my ladies beardless yeah yeah

5180.639 --> 5185.12
have you shared the black swan fitting

5182.56 --> 5185.120000000001
oh yeah

5186.08 --> 5190.96
yeah

5186.96 --> 5190.96
i will i forgot about that

5193.6 --> 5196.400000000001
yeah that was pretty

5194.84 --> 5199.1990000000005
epic

5196.4 --> 5199.199
i'll share that

5200.96 --> 5205.84
just if i could just get this thing to

5202.96 --> 5205.84
freaking pause

5206.4 --> 5209.4
god

5211.76 --> 5214.0
right

5215.76 --> 5218.08
okay

5218.4 --> 5224.5599999999995
that is really cool

5221.36 --> 5227.96
is elise g send me this

5224.56 --> 5227.96
check it out

5240.639 --> 5245.92
isn't that just

5242.4 --> 5245.92
absolutely astounding

5251.6 --> 5255.92
this is a really big ass fish by the way

5256.96 --> 5261.4800000000005
but just like holy [ __ ]

5267.6 --> 5272.4400000000005
i guess we're not the only farmers

5287.199 --> 5291.12
yeah i don't know how it learned to do

5288.8 --> 5291.12
that i

5291.84 --> 5298.12
it's

5292.84 --> 5298.12
magical it's it is magical

5328.08 --> 5333.84
a monkey was a train switch opera right

5331.52 --> 5337.6
okay but that's a monkey

5333.84 --> 5340.639
i mean a monkey can kind of be trained

5337.6 --> 5342.56
to a certain degree right

5340.639 --> 5345.04
it's still weird though really train

5342.56 --> 5346.080000000001
switch operator what the

5345.04 --> 5348.159
but like

5346.08 --> 5352.88
as swan

5348.159 --> 5352.879999999999
that's a completely different creature

5355.36 --> 5358.96
so it's pretty amazing to just see it do

5357.76 --> 5361.04
that

5358.96 --> 5365.84
but i don't think you can like train

5361.04 --> 5365.84
swans they're super independent

5390.08 --> 5395.32
all right let me just show that again it

5391.92 --> 5395.32
was so amazing

5414.96 --> 5419.199
right

5416.4 --> 5422.159
this is not just a one-time fluke action

5419.199 --> 5422.159
like that's one

5422.32 --> 5426.96
is knowingly feeding these fishes

5429.28 --> 5435.759999999999
because it's doing it twice it's not

5431.12 --> 5435.76
just like oh it's just randomly happen

5446.159 --> 5449.159
hmm

5452.0 --> 5456.239
goat inhaling smoke what the hell

5458.639 --> 5462.36
whoa trippy

5467.199 --> 5469.599999999999
bro

5474.48 --> 5477.839999999999
that's that's funny

5492.8 --> 5496.4800000000005
right but it depends on like what it's

5495.28 --> 5498.639
not just

5496.48 --> 5499.839999999999
it's probably not just random

5498.639 --> 5501.52
that goat

5499.84 --> 5503.679
doing that

5501.52 --> 5505.84
right so it all depends on what incense

5503.679 --> 5508.4
was being burned because if it was for

5505.84 --> 5508.400000000001
example

5509.12 --> 5515.159
the typical one

5511.36 --> 5515.159
what's it called again

5521.36 --> 5525.679
it's very standard it's used like

5523.6 --> 5527.52
typically to clean

5525.679 --> 5530.96
to clean the air

5527.52 --> 5533.1990000000005
it has antiseptic qualities

5530.96 --> 5535.04
is it called again

5533.199 --> 5537.12
ah

5535.04 --> 5541.639
but

5537.12 --> 5541.639
i have some in the closet actually

5547.52 --> 5552.400000000001
sage right

5549.679 --> 5554.88
yeah sage

5552.4 --> 5557.759999999999
is actually like the goat might

5554.88 --> 5559.52
literally be doing that to give itself a

5557.76 --> 5561.52
parasite cleansing

5559.52 --> 5563.52
a lung cleansing really

5561.52 --> 5565.1990000000005
right if that was sage and god would be

5563.52 --> 5569.52
like

5565.199 --> 5572.32
yeah it's doing that literally because

5569.52 --> 5574.8
for medical purposes

5572.32 --> 5578.159
right it's not just like or it could be

5574.8 --> 5578.159000000001
cannabis too who knows

5581.199 --> 5587.638999999999
no sage in tibet

5584.0 --> 5587.639
how do you know that

5594.88 --> 5599.12
anyway it's just an example right

5599.52 --> 5605.6
it could just realize like that's

5603.44 --> 5608.32
like a parasite cleansing

5605.6 --> 5610.639
treatment it's giving itself

5608.32 --> 5612.719
or cannabis

5610.639 --> 5614.84
and then it's just really a stone go

5612.719 --> 5620.44
stoner

5614.84 --> 5620.4400000000005
goat you did seem to enjoy it a lot

5650.08 --> 5653.08
hmm

5665.36 --> 5668.36
hmm

5678.96 --> 5686.2390000000005
right i think i'm gonna run out the show

5681.04 --> 5688.48
my jaw is being very distracting and

5686.239 --> 5688.48
uh

5691.52 --> 5696.2390000000005
finally an early bird show about birds

5694.0 --> 5698.48
and goats apparently

5696.239 --> 5700.638999999999
and fishes

5698.48 --> 5703.36
but i really like that picture the

5700.639 --> 5703.36
vicious one

5705.76 --> 5711.04
it's such a great little clip that it's

5708.239 --> 5713.36
almost like worth just making a photo of

5711.04 --> 5715.84
it and then maybe using it

5713.36 --> 5718.4
in the title card somewhere so yeah i

5715.84 --> 5720.719
really appreciate you sharing that with

5718.4 --> 5722.799999999999
me elishi

5720.719 --> 5724.719
it is pretty epic

5722.8 --> 5727.719
but the stoner code was also kind of

5724.719 --> 5727.719
cool

5728.32 --> 5734.92
you could put the swan feeding the fish

5731.119 --> 5734.92
in your intro

5744.08 --> 5748.4
maybe

5745.199 --> 5750.799999999999
but i really like my intro though

5748.4 --> 5754.08
i really like it as is but

5750.8 --> 5754.08
maybe an outro

5755.44 --> 5760.879999999999
or maybe i'll save it up for like a

5758.4 --> 5764.08
night owl intro right i still kind of

5760.88 --> 5766.96
need a night out intro

5764.08 --> 5769.119
but yeah i'm definitely gonna save it

5766.96 --> 5770.4800000000005
because it is a pretty epic little video

5769.119 --> 5772.5599999999995
there

5770.48 --> 5775.5599999999995
i do want to use it it's like really

5772.56 --> 5775.56
good

5794.719 --> 5799.84
it's kind of funny though i've been

5796.159 --> 5799.839999999999
thinking like just now

5800.719 --> 5805.28
you could basically have like a

5803.04 --> 5807.76
succession of all these kinds of clips

5805.28 --> 5810.88
of animals

5807.76 --> 5812.96
basically taking care of animals but not

5810.88 --> 5814.96
necessarily oh heart string but just

5812.96 --> 5818.159
like really unusual like this like this

5814.96 --> 5819.6
one feeding the fishes

5818.159 --> 5821.5199999999995
or the goat

5819.6 --> 5823.280000000001
acting like a stoner

5821.52 --> 5825.360000000001
and then just have a whole bunch of

5823.28 --> 5827.92
those clips together and then it's like

5825.36 --> 5830.32
this is the animal society right if

5827.92 --> 5832.96
humans are not gonna act like humans

5830.32 --> 5835.28
then the animals will just have to take

5832.96 --> 5836.32
over the role

5835.28 --> 5839.88
right

5836.32 --> 5839.88
that could be funny

5847.199 --> 5850.199
do

5865.76 --> 5870.8
the early goat catches the fish and what

5877.44 --> 5882.919999999999
so rather the early swan feeds the fish

5892.0 --> 5898.719
to really look up to birds

5895.04 --> 5898.719
is that because they're flying

5902.719 --> 5906.719
no but yeah

5904.719 --> 5911.36
i don't really look up to birds but i do

5906.719 --> 5914.0
respect them i do understand like

5911.36 --> 5914.0
they are

5914.239 --> 5919.678999999999
they have an intelligence

5916.88 --> 5922.639
they have communication they have rules

5919.679 --> 5922.639
and they have like

5923.44 --> 5927.44
attitudes

5924.96 --> 5930.119
towards other species that are very

5927.44 --> 5931.759999999999
specific and that are even like

5930.119 --> 5935.119
inter-social

5931.76 --> 5936.96
about other species right it's like for

5935.119 --> 5939.28
example we have crows

5936.96 --> 5942.2390000000005
they're very sharpened they're very

5939.28 --> 5943.5199999999995
defensive too against other species

5942.239 --> 5946.0
but

5943.52 --> 5948.719
like then you have magpies and there's

5946.0 --> 5951.6
like really goofy kind of like out of

5948.719 --> 5955.679
control characters among them

5951.6 --> 5958.320000000001
and crows treat those differently

5955.679 --> 5960.4
than magpies that are much more careful

5958.32 --> 5962.719
nature

5960.4 --> 5965.04
like they can distinguish it's not like

5962.719 --> 5967.44
oh they're all just magpies so we're all

5965.04 --> 5970.56
to give them the rough treatment

5967.44 --> 5973.759999999999
they actually pick out

5970.56 --> 5978.119000000001
on their character with other species

5973.76 --> 5978.119000000001
right that's something that i noticed

5983.84 --> 5988.639
yeah i don't like pigeons to see well

5985.76 --> 5991.360000000001
pigeons i like white doves

5988.639 --> 5993.28
and you know pigeon i don't really do i

5991.36 --> 5995.36
don't really hate them

5993.28 --> 5997.5199999999995
it's just that when there's a lot of

5995.36 --> 5999.44
them that gets a little annoying and

5997.52 --> 6001.76
shitty

5999.44 --> 6003.44
but seagulls yeah i i can't stand

6001.76 --> 6006.84
singles

6003.44 --> 6009.36
i mean i think there's way too many of

6006.84 --> 6011.76
them and they just like

6009.36 --> 6014.08
a bunch of looter birds just

6011.76 --> 6016.400000000001
go everywhere loot everything and then

6014.08 --> 6020.92
go away again like they have no

6016.4 --> 6020.92
territorial loyalty whatsoever

6034.159 --> 6038.0
yeah they just steal your food yeah they

6035.76 --> 6039.4400000000005
steal freaking food from humans too

6038.0 --> 6041.199
they're very

6039.44 --> 6044.0
very cheeky

6041.199 --> 6046.5599999999995
like other birds don't do that freaking

6044.0 --> 6049.52
seagulls will just like

6046.56 --> 6051.52
rub your lunch right off your table on

6049.52 --> 6054.96
your balcony if you're going to the

6051.52 --> 6056.8
toilet for a second yeah they will

6054.96 --> 6058.08
because they're a bunch of looting

6056.8 --> 6059.679
bastards

6058.08 --> 6061.28
they don't give a [ __ ]

6059.679 --> 6064.92
if they think they can get away with it

6061.28 --> 6064.92
they'll just do it

6075.28 --> 6079.119
the pigeons land on your kabob

6079.76 --> 6082.88
those are some pretty cheeky pigeons

6081.6 --> 6085.1990000000005
then

6082.88 --> 6085.1990000000005
damn

6086.56 --> 6093.119000000001
well when pigeons are like in large

6089.199 --> 6094.08
groups they can be pretty like

6093.119 --> 6097.759999999999
yeah

6094.08 --> 6100.239
they'll just freaking swarm you and [ __ ]

6097.76 --> 6101.92
they'll literally just bump into you

6100.239 --> 6104.48
until you fall over

6101.92 --> 6106.4
if they're with enough numbers

6104.48 --> 6107.839999999999
but as individuals they're not that

6106.4 --> 6110.48
terrible

6107.84 --> 6112.88
they're just kind of dumb birds

6110.48 --> 6115.44
but they really get this crazy group

6112.88 --> 6115.4400000000005
momentum

6116.4 --> 6124.679
and then they can get kind of aggressive

6120.639 --> 6124.679
to get what they want

6135.84 --> 6138.96
look clutch

6137.84 --> 6143.119000000001
well

6138.96 --> 6145.52
peck yeah isn't that uh

6143.119 --> 6148.5599999999995
yeah aren't those like magpies don't

6145.52 --> 6149.360000000001
don't like wild magpies typically do

6148.56 --> 6151.119000000001
that

6149.36 --> 6153.679
just attack people there's videos of

6151.119 --> 6155.599999999999
that it's in america too

6153.679 --> 6157.84
like the magpies over here are kind of

6155.6 --> 6158.719
tame they're just a bit nutty and all

6157.84 --> 6161.28
that

6158.719 --> 6163.6
and cheeky and noisy but they don't

6161.28 --> 6166.159
they're yeah they're not like fearless

6163.6 --> 6168.0
or anything they don't just attack

6166.159 --> 6170.4
people

6168.0 --> 6173.28
but there are some wilder magpies in

6170.4 --> 6177.0
america that do that

6173.28 --> 6177.0
that i've seen on video

6185.119 --> 6190.5199999999995
the cheekiest bastard pigeon gets the

6187.52 --> 6190.52
kebab

6195.52 --> 6198.52
man

6207.33 --> 6210.43
[Music]

6212.639 --> 6215.639
do

6222.719 --> 6225.719
so

6244.639 --> 6248.88
australia has to be the worst place on

6246.639 --> 6250.08
earth no it's not

6248.88 --> 6252.88
it's just

6250.08 --> 6254.0
kind of wild

6252.88 --> 6256.32
birds are

6254.0 --> 6259.28
creatures there are just kind of

6256.32 --> 6259.28
rugged and rough

6259.6 --> 6264.4800000000005
and aggressive sometimes

6262.239 --> 6266.959999999999
right because nature there is pretty

6264.48 --> 6270.799999999999
dramatic

6266.96 --> 6274.2390000000005
can get very hot and very cold

6270.8 --> 6276.96
very moist and very dry

6274.239 --> 6278.718999999999
so yeah then animals that have to live

6276.96 --> 6280.719
through that they tend to get a little

6278.719 --> 6284.159
bit more rugged

6280.719 --> 6284.159
just like people by the way

6284.639 --> 6290.32
unless they pamper themselves too much

6289.04 --> 6294.0
in their houses with their air

6290.32 --> 6294.0
conditioning etc etc

6299.92 --> 6303.4400000000005
the worst place on earth is the

6301.36 --> 6307.44
international space station

6303.44 --> 6311.48
no it is on earth actually geoshifter

6307.44 --> 6311.48
they just claim it isn't

6329.6 --> 6334.56
the american bald eagle is an apex

6332.0 --> 6336.719
predator

6334.56 --> 6341.080000000001
really

6336.719 --> 6341.08
then why is it a threatened species

6356.239 --> 6359.839999999999
i mean come on

6360.159 --> 6365.119
if you're an apex predator you're not

6362.0 --> 6369.08
going to be a threatened species are you

6365.119 --> 6369.08
that doesn't make any sense

6384.4 --> 6387.4
uh

6388.96 --> 6394.4800000000005
because guns are more apex

6391.36 --> 6394.48
now what look

6394.56 --> 6398.84
what yeah okay people might have hunted

6396.96 --> 6400.719
them and all that and that's

6398.84 --> 6402.88
terrible but

6400.719 --> 6405.28
it's not really that apex because

6402.88 --> 6407.119
apparently it doesn't procreate all that

6405.28 --> 6409.28
quickly

6407.119 --> 6409.28
so

6410.96 --> 6413.96
right

6415.44 --> 6419.28
bald eagles they're pretty common

6418.08 --> 6420.159
are they

6419.28 --> 6422.08
oh

6420.159 --> 6424.159
okay

6422.08 --> 6426.0
i don't know

6424.159 --> 6427.199
i just i mean i think they're pretty

6426.0 --> 6430.159
cool

6427.199 --> 6432.4
and they look very cool and i like i

6430.159 --> 6434.719
really respect their eyesight which is

6432.4 --> 6438.719
just amazing

6434.719 --> 6438.719
to be able to hunt the way they

6440.84 --> 6446.400000000001
do you have to say

6443.679 --> 6448.4
ipacs pretty dear

6446.4 --> 6450.719
is that steve irwin's accent i don't

6448.4 --> 6450.719
remember

6450.96 --> 6454.679
ipacs predator

6456.0 --> 6459.239
that good

6476.56 --> 6481.96
yeah they're huge

6478.0 --> 6481.96
they're they're really big

6490.0 --> 6494.88
killer whales and apex pretty there

6493.679 --> 6497.1990000000005
for sure

6494.88 --> 6499.28
yeah but they are

6497.199 --> 6502.96
like orcas are

6499.28 --> 6504.8
very successful and dangerous predators

6502.96 --> 6507.44
like they're not going to go extinct any

6504.8 --> 6507.4400000000005
time soon

6508.639 --> 6513.36
right that's what really makes an apex

6510.639 --> 6518.1990000000005
predator is that you can't

6513.36 --> 6518.199
yeah they're not easily endangered

6526.8 --> 6533.28
apparently they have to try to

6529.52 --> 6533.280000000001
yeah so do swans kevlar

6534.0 --> 6539.28
right and by the way

6536.88 --> 6541.92
that is a sign of intelligence

6539.28 --> 6544.48
did you realize that

6541.92 --> 6548.4
have you ever tried to cross-reference

6544.48 --> 6551.44
with every animal ever

6548.4 --> 6556.4
animals that have mates for life

6551.44 --> 6558.879999999999
are always more intelligent always

6556.4 --> 6560.0
pay careful attention

6558.88 --> 6562.0
right

6560.0 --> 6566.08

actually dumber

6576.639 --> 6582.32

6577.76 --> 6585.76

6582.32 --> 6589.5199999999995
to be with somebody your entire life

6585.76 --> 6591.04
to actually make that connection
