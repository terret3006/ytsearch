nice not too cloudy but couple of clouds

103.36 --> 109.079
out

104.64 --> 113.159
there between some nice blue

109.079 --> 113.15899999999999
sky there's a lot of wind

116.479 --> 120.6
out wind is blowing continually but it's

119.399 --> 124.43900000000001

nice it feels pretty

125.799 --> 130.679
warm and it's currently quite

130.959 --> 135.92000000000002
Sunny so yeah amazing Skies again

141.16 --> 144.44
here all

147.84 --> 153.72
right it is Sunday the 9th of June

155.239 --> 162.76
2024 can't believe we're almost

158.8 --> 162.76000000000002
halfway this crazy

167.12 --> 171.56
year that went way quicker than I

172.44 --> 177.68
anticipated or right than I expected I

175.519 --> 180.92000000000002
mean anticipated would be a weird thing

177.68 --> 180.92000000000002
to say

185.08 --> 188.08
uh

189.519 --> 199.68
right temperature is 17°

193.68 --> 202.799
C 0% precipitation but 47% humidity

199.68 --> 202.799
there's always so much

204.44 --> 208.439
humidity

206.799 --> 210.31900000000002
what

208.439 --> 214.28
damn say

210.319 --> 216.51899999999998
13° C tomorrow wow what is

214.28 --> 219.08
this when are we finally going to get

216.519 --> 219.08
some real

219.959 --> 224.64000000000001
summer well today is a nice day at least

223.12 --> 227.64000000000001
so that's

224.64 --> 230.64
something and who knows how weather

227.64 --> 230.64
reports going to change

230.92 --> 234.92
around right

240.48 --> 247.0
so yeah yesterday great

242.92 --> 247.0
show was very happy about

247.079 --> 256.759
it I keep having ups and downs

251.799 --> 259.84000000000003
like shitty shows and then great shows

256.759 --> 262.32
again so let's hope that I can keep it

259.84 --> 263.919
up I keep saying that every time I have

262.32 --> 267.71999999999997
a great

263.919 --> 270.71999999999997
show and then we'll see if I actually

267.72 --> 270.72
manage

271.4 --> 274.0
what

274.28 --> 280.88
okay

276.96 --> 280.88
uh seems that every

281.199 --> 288.52000000000004
time I get all environmentalist with my

285.16 --> 291.91900000000004
subjects I have a great

288.52 --> 295.15999999999997
show and to be fair I have a lot of

291.919 --> 298.19899999999996
things to say in that direction so maybe

295.16 --> 303.36
that contributed to me just having a

298.199 --> 303.36
fluid show and not so many dead

303.72 --> 308.91900000000004
silences which of course don't make all

306.28 --> 308.919
that great a

312.4 --> 316.12
show all right

318.36 --> 326.639
so yeah my lunch break had a a new video

322.56 --> 326.639
very long over an hour long

327.52 --> 334.28
video about all these buildings in New

330.199 --> 337.479
York really fascinating and I mean there

334.28 --> 337.479
is something weird going

344.919 --> 351.71999999999997
on I'm just wondering like how to

348.08 --> 351.71999999999997
picture it all together

352.36 --> 358.44
really like are these really building

354.88 --> 361.199
from a previous civilization but if so

358.44 --> 363.56
what exact exctly was that previous

361.199 --> 366.08000000000004
civilization like then

363.56 --> 369.4
because I mean that architecture is

366.08 --> 372.639
already kind of

369.4 --> 372.63899999999995
metropoline it's

374.16 --> 380.8
like it's not that far away from Modern

378.639 --> 386.08
Day architecture in in a sense so it's

380.8 --> 386.08
kind of weird it's just just strange

390.0 --> 395.039
but yeah

391.56 --> 398.199
just this extremely sparing amount of

395.039 --> 400.759
time with which these gigantic buildings

398.199 --> 402.40000000000003
were supposedly built like that part is

400.759 --> 406.56
really

402.4 --> 406.56
suspicious you don't build like

407.16 --> 413.199
a a 10 story building in in just two

410.84 --> 415.84
years or something like

413.199 --> 419.599
uh in in those times I mean that's

415.84 --> 419.599
completely unrealistic

421.599 --> 425.039
hello who's

425.84 --> 431.08
that hello alternate world first in

435.96 --> 438.96
chat

440.84 --> 447.96
huh welcome to the early bir

444.56 --> 451.28000000000003
show I don't think I've ever heard of

447.96 --> 451.28
you before

457.96 --> 465.23999999999995
what I see on your

460.759 --> 468.47900000000004
channel you are well aware of Flat

465.24 --> 471.479
Earth and you're also into UFOs and

468.479 --> 471.479
stuff

484.8 --> 487.039
all

491.72 --> 496.68
right okay w

498.759 --> 502.56
a what's going on

502.68 --> 510.12
here are you do you have are you having

506.4 --> 510.12
trouble with typing

523.959 --> 530.0
weird

526.16 --> 531.959
right uh so yeah my lunch break great

530.0 --> 534.12
video I put it in my favorite list I

531.959 --> 538.3599999999999
mean it's been a very good Channel thus

534.12 --> 538.36
far very consistent to

554.48 --> 558.6800000000001
um what else

574.64 --> 580.3199999999999
yeah some things that I probably can't

577.2 --> 580.32
really talk about on

582.6 --> 589.72
YouTube let's just

585.12 --> 592.12
say that currently there are certain

589.72 --> 593.0400000000001
life insurance companies that aren't

592.12 --> 597.0
paying

593.04 --> 600.7199999999999
out with people that died

597.0 --> 603.76
suddenly from

600.72 --> 606.76
officially yeah noted as having taken

603.76 --> 608.8
medical experimentation so that's

606.76 --> 611.0
something but I can't really talk

608.8 --> 614.3199999999999
further about it but they basically

611.0 --> 614.32
classify it as

614.8 --> 620.5999999999999
like this is the like they I mean they

618.12 --> 623.519
they are insurance company so they they

620.6 --> 626.0400000000001
will try to like really push

623.519 --> 628.12
it that's what insurance companies do

626.04 --> 631.7199999999999
with these kinds of things but still I

628.12 --> 633.64
mean they basically say like yeah it's

631.72 --> 636.8000000000001
we don't pay out

633.64 --> 640.8389999999999
because doing the medical

636.8 --> 642.76
experimentation is considered like

640.839 --> 646.72
suicide

642.76 --> 649.72
seriously it's pretty brutal but still I

646.72 --> 649.72
mean

657.44 --> 661.72
wow so that's GNA said a

667.079 --> 672.56
president but yeah I mean in a way I

670.04 --> 675.04
kind of agree I mean you can't really

672.56 --> 675.04
blame

676.72 --> 681.32
them right other than that

685.0 --> 690.0
um yeah I did some cooking oh it was

688.8 --> 691.92
great

690.0 --> 696.279
finally made like a big

691.92 --> 696.279
meal with lot of lots of

696.8 --> 703.76
vegetables and some

699.68 --> 707.3199999999999
chicken the chicken was incredibly

703.76 --> 710.88
expensive but it was still worth

707.32 --> 713.399
it let's see what was in it I wrote down

710.88 --> 713.399
the list

714.079 --> 719.92
somewhere oh yeah chicken filet blocks

717.0 --> 723.079
and coconut oil with

719.92 --> 725.16
with Indonesian style hot sauce garlic

723.079 --> 728.3599999999999
and snap

725.16 --> 732.6
sauce then vegetables added carrots

728.36 --> 735.6
broccoli celery green beans and bok

732.6 --> 735.6
choy

736.399 --> 743.839
great like that really replenished me so

739.8 --> 746.5999999999999
yeah man I should probably

743.839 --> 749.0
do actual elaborate cooking like that

746.6 --> 752.16
more often but I mean I was like over 2

749.0 --> 752.16
hours in the kitchen

752.24 --> 757.9590000000001
so while hungry that's the big problem

755.04 --> 761.04
is that oh you're hungry I'm going to

757.959 --> 765.5999999999999
cook but if you then are busy for two

761.04 --> 765.5999999999999
hours like it becomes a little

765.92 --> 774.36
tricky but yeah I got food for like half

768.839 --> 774.36
a week or something and I do feel very

774.72 --> 780.1990000000001
replenished

777.279 --> 784.079
right so altern world are you going to

780.199 --> 787.959
say anything other than W and

784.079 --> 791.68
a and is anybody else going to show up

787.959 --> 791.68
perhaps would be kind of

792.16 --> 800.56
interesting anybody has any

795.56 --> 800.56
questions I'm also up for that

825.68 --> 829.0899999999999
[Music]

850.279 --> 856.16
just some article just came in

852.759 --> 858.5600000000001
apparently 300 billion EUR is missing

856.16 --> 861.7199999999999
from the

858.56 --> 864.8389999999999
pensions over here I mean I'm surprised

861.72 --> 867.839
there was any pensions at all at this

864.839 --> 867.839
point

872.399 --> 877.279
but apparently there's still some left

874.399 --> 879.44
so that is the thing about the article

877.279 --> 882.6
that surprises me is like wait what

879.44 --> 885.6800000000001
there's there's some pension money left

882.6 --> 888.36
you say I kind of thought that there

885.68 --> 891.2399999999999
wouldn't be anything at all or like in

888.36 --> 891.24
the minus or

892.0 --> 895.759
something cuz it was all

895.839 --> 900.72
looted like a decade ago

906.8 --> 913.0899999999999
anyway okay we're going to be like that

909.99 --> 913.09

right yeah but thanks for letting me

1195.48 --> 1200.64
know Spirit phone Spirit boxes

1202.679 --> 1206.0
do you think that was

1211.0 --> 1217.0
viable I've heard of that

1214.88 --> 1222.919
thing

1217.0 --> 1222.919
well they made it work it's creepy

1224.44 --> 1230.64
though afterlife

1226.919 --> 1230.64
communication well that's really

1238.679 --> 1244.8400000000001
freaky I mean sounds like a an

1242.28 --> 1248.3999999999999
electrified Ouija board or something in

1244.84 --> 1252.32
that sense I mean yeah I can imagine

1248.4 --> 1252.3200000000002
that they made something like that

1255.559 --> 1263.3999999999999
sure very weird though

1260.12 --> 1268.3999999999999
like what the hell are you even going

1263.4 --> 1268.4
to talk to them about you

1279.0 --> 1290.159
know but yeah THC Jack I heard even

1284.96 --> 1290.159
that way back then they had

1292.72 --> 1299.1200000000001
like video call systems I mean it might

1296.2 --> 1302.88
be just a weird rumor or

1299.12 --> 1305.32
something but that they actually had

1302.88 --> 1307.72
communication remote communication like

1305.32 --> 1310.84
even with video with some kind of video

1307.72 --> 1310.84
thing really

1311.96 --> 1320.52
weird so who knows where they took

1317.159 --> 1322.7600000000002
it but yeah I mean

1320.52 --> 1327.08
oo Spirit

1322.76 --> 1333.44
phones that you can talk with your

1327.08 --> 1333.4399999999998
ancestors that have passed away like uh

1334.159 --> 1339.6000000000001
why I mean it could be very handy it's

1336.76 --> 1342.279
like hey uh yeah we never actually got

1339.6 --> 1347.279
your will uh could you please Lay It

1342.279 --> 1350.679
Down For Us afterward but I mean like

1347.279 --> 1351.919
the legal implic ations of such a device

1350.679 --> 1354.72
is going to

1351.919 --> 1357.1200000000001
be

1354.72 --> 1359.4
like

1357.12 --> 1363.1589999999999
painful like that's going to

1359.4 --> 1369.679
be going to get crazy and like the the

1363.159 --> 1369.679
grab ability of of it is going to be

1370.64 --> 1375.679
staggering like if like just imagine

1373.279 --> 1377.76
that such a device would actually be

1375.679 --> 1379.679
industrially standardized and just

1377.76 --> 1383.64
legalized

1379.679 --> 1389.679
dude it's going to get so

1383.64 --> 1389.679
grabed people are going to try to like

1390.039 --> 1398.72
trick manipulate

1392.679 --> 1401.0800000000002
it get all legal and weird on it so yeah

1398.72 --> 1401.08
very

1401.12 --> 1409.12
strange such a device including like

1406.279 --> 1411.799
why I mean just for the Cure curiosity

1409.12 --> 1411.799
of it I get

1415.08 --> 1422.6399999999999
it but I

1418.12 --> 1422.6399999999999
mean yeah it's just

1432.279 --> 1438.799
weird but I mean in a

1435.159 --> 1441.3600000000001
sense depending on well how how the

1438.799 --> 1442.32
quality of it would work if you could

1441.36 --> 1446.52
like

1442.32 --> 1448.36
retrieve detailed memory from ped away

1446.52 --> 1451.72
people through that

1448.36 --> 1457.0
device holy

1451.72 --> 1457.0
[ __ ] implications would be

1457.24 --> 1463.6
staggering but it also depends on

1460.44 --> 1466.679
like how it would work

1463.6 --> 1468.9599999999998
like is there a time

1466.679 --> 1472.159
limitation right is is there like a

1468.96 --> 1474.24
certain window of time in which you can

1472.159 --> 1476.2
communicate with the deceased person and

1474.24 --> 1480.919
then it doesn't work anymore or doesn't

1476.2 --> 1484.44
work as well does the the corporate

1480.919 --> 1486.96
Corporal state of the disease matter for

1484.44 --> 1489.159
the communication so like they were

1486.96 --> 1491.3600000000001
buried does it work if they were

1489.159 --> 1494.96
cremated does it not work or does it

1491.36 --> 1497.52
work less or like there's all these

1494.96 --> 1500.559
things but I mean if you could just like

1497.52 --> 1504.44
communicate with the dead like they were

1500.559 --> 1507.0
there fully functional I mean yeah you

1504.44 --> 1509.48
could then potentially use it to

1507.0 --> 1512.44
retrieve detailed

1509.48 --> 1514.6
memories of the dead and that would be

1512.44 --> 1516.919
absolutely

1514.6 --> 1518.399
mindblowing especially if you could

1516.919 --> 1523.0
reach

1518.399 --> 1524.6
back to like a very far ancestor that

1523.0 --> 1527.32
would have been dead for hundreds of

1524.6 --> 1530.1589999999999
years and you could like ask them like

1527.32 --> 1532.1589999999999
hey could you describe the world you

1530.159 --> 1537.159
lived in to

1532.159 --> 1538.64
me like the little things and like what

1537.159 --> 1541.7600000000002
was

1538.64 --> 1545.3990000000001
taught like what did people

1541.76 --> 1547.919
believe the past was like who is ruling

1545.399 --> 1551.76
what do you call it right that kind of

1547.919 --> 1554.039
thing I mean holy [ __ ] implications

1551.76 --> 1555.84
would absolutely be staggering but again

1554.039 --> 1558.919
that all depends on

1555.84 --> 1561.6399999999999
like how

1558.919 --> 1564.3600000000001
what are the parameters of this

1561.64 --> 1564.3600000000001
afterlife

1566.36 --> 1570.9599999999998
communication oh astral soul I don't

1569.919 --> 1574.44
know who you

1570.96 --> 1574.44
are but

1579.2 --> 1583.2
welcome h

1589.12 --> 1591.36
all

1591.84 --> 1599.279
right low Health Luna

1595.32 --> 1599.279
Bar kinds of new people

1601.799 --> 1605.72
today don't know what the hell happened

1604.0 --> 1610.52
with alternate World

1605.72 --> 1610.52
earlier maybe his keyboard crashed or

1615.72 --> 1620.24
something you are the Astro

1620.559 --> 1626.039
I don't know who that is astral Soul so

1628.84 --> 1635.0
pure I don't recognize you but welcome

1632.12 --> 1635.0
to the early bir

1636.039 --> 1642.72
show right so yeah thanks for the

1638.32 --> 1647.36
interesting question there THC Jack hope

1642.72 --> 1647.3600000000001
you appreciate my elaborate answer

1649.12 --> 1656.279
right I mean that is that exactly right

1652.919 --> 1658.44
there is what I typically want in this

1656.279 --> 1661.0
channel it's like oh somebody says

1658.44 --> 1664.72
something it's like

1661.0 --> 1667.799
what guess what I'm going to be able to

1664.72 --> 1672.0
like it not being freshly In My Memory

1667.799 --> 1675.0
I'm going to be able to give a sensible

1672.0 --> 1675.0
elaborate

1675.399 --> 1680.6789999999999
answer that gives perspective that is

1678.24 --> 1683.919
what I can do like even if potentially

1680.679 --> 1686.48
I've never heard of the subject

1683.919 --> 1688.64
before and that's why people should come

1686.48 --> 1690.72
to my channel in my chat during my live

1688.64 --> 1693.159
shows and ask me questions about these

1690.72 --> 1693.159
types of

1697.44 --> 1700.44
things

1702.08 --> 1706.279
what

1703.799 --> 1709.559
rdr2 what what are you talking about

1706.279 --> 1709.559
health lunabar

1720.84 --> 1727.1589999999999
guys I've been thinking about something

1722.84 --> 1729.48
that's to me just as a model of

1727.159 --> 1731.3200000000002
entertainment incredibly mind-blowing

1729.48 --> 1735.32
and it relates

1731.32 --> 1738.8799999999999
to these supposed buildings that just

1735.32 --> 1742.08
come out of nowhere

1738.88 --> 1744.3600000000001
or that my lunch break things are from a

1742.08 --> 1747.1999999999998
previous civilization and they were like

1744.36 --> 1747.1999999999998
always there

1749.84 --> 1756.4399999999998
Etc but I mean in a way it doesn't make

1753.6 --> 1759.0
sense it doesn't even make sense that

1756.44 --> 1762.0
these kind of gigantic buildings would

1759.0 --> 1764.64
just be there in the middle of nowhere

1762.0 --> 1765.919
it which is what it would have been it

1764.64 --> 1768.5590000000002
would have been basically in the middle

1765.919 --> 1770.3990000000001
of nowhere

1768.559 --> 1772.08
right if you're going to build a

1770.399 --> 1773.9189999999999
building that's that big in a

1772.08 --> 1776.9189999999999
civilization you're not going to just

1773.919 --> 1779.44
have one freaking Monumental Palace

1776.919 --> 1780.96
likee building and that's it you're

1779.44 --> 1782.72
going to have

1780.96 --> 1785.88
multiple

1782.72 --> 1789.799
structures to make it a cohesive hole to

1785.88 --> 1791.6000000000001
make it a place just one gigantic

1789.799 --> 1795.1589999999999
building sticking out in the middle of

1791.6 --> 1798.1589999999999
nowhere is like that's not logical

1795.159 --> 1798.159
either

1799.08 --> 1804.0
so

1800.559 --> 1807.399
what what if the

1804.0 --> 1810.159
Freemasons actually figured out a really

1807.399 --> 1811.9599999999998
freaky and magical I mean you can't

1810.159 --> 1815.6000000000001
really describe it any other way a

1811.96 --> 1817.88
magical way to build these kinds of

1815.6 --> 1823.48
insanely Vast

1817.88 --> 1823.48
architectures at an extremely rapid

1825.279 --> 1831.76
Pace what if they figured it out

1829.159 --> 1836.0
but there could be some very serious

1831.76 --> 1838.6
Darkness tied into that process somehow

1836.0 --> 1841.76
like potentially even like you need to

1838.6 --> 1845.6399999999999
sacrifice something kind of thing like a

1841.76 --> 1845.64
deal with the devil

1846.799 --> 1852.9189999999999
scenario but what if it comes down to

1850.36 --> 1855.559
like that they can

1852.919 --> 1859.3990000000001
like basically build a building like

1855.559 --> 1859.399
that almost overnight

1859.48 --> 1864.88
and like the materials just they come

1861.84 --> 1868.4399999999998
from nowhere like they weren't delivered

1864.88 --> 1871.5590000000002
there's not like a giant stash of blocks

1868.44 --> 1876.0
and bars and everything that's been like

1871.559 --> 1879.44
no it literally like manifests out of

1876.0 --> 1884.12
nothing because the logistics of all of

1879.44 --> 1888.72
it like and and my lunch break lays that

1884.12 --> 1891.12
down and now it gets really weird okay

1888.72 --> 1895.519
I'm going to tie Mandela effect into

1891.12 --> 1899.8799999999999
this yeah so what if Mandela

1895.519 --> 1903.88
effect has something to do

1899.88 --> 1903.88
with suspense of

1905.76 --> 1914.039
time what if like this normal linear

1909.399 --> 1916.1999999999998
time experience can somehow be paused

1914.039 --> 1919.799
and everything in

1916.2 --> 1922.0800000000002
it like every one would be basically not

1919.799 --> 1923.639
subject be subjected to entropy except

1922.08 --> 1926.6789999999999
maybe

1923.639 --> 1929.9599999999998
spiritually what if like the whole

1926.679 --> 1933.5590000000002
timeline could be frozen temporary but

1929.96 --> 1936.799
that the builders would

1933.559 --> 1940.96
basically be able to continue

1936.799 --> 1940.96
on in between

1942.32 --> 1946.24
time so it would almost be like the

1944.919 --> 1948.8400000000001
Dragon Ball

1946.24 --> 1952.039
Z uh time

1948.84 --> 1953.4399999999998
chamber you go in for a day but you stay

1952.039 --> 1956.08
in there for a

1953.44 --> 1958.279
year and when you come out it's just one

1956.08 --> 1961.72
day later but you've had all that

1958.279 --> 1964.2
enormous amount of maybe that some kind

1961.72 --> 1966.519
of process like that is

1964.2 --> 1968.3600000000001
involved and that those buildings would

1966.519 --> 1973.08
literally disappear out of nowhere

1968.36 --> 1976.279
because extra time was created in

1973.08 --> 1980.1589999999999
between or from another perspective like

1976.279 --> 1983.88
the entire world is basically put on

1980.159 --> 1986.0800000000002
pause like literally Frozen in time and

1983.88 --> 1988.8400000000001
not subjected to entropy and nothing

1986.08 --> 1990.279
everything and that like they can build

1988.84 --> 1993.4399999999998
in between

1990.279 --> 1997.44
time and then for the normal experienced

1993.44 --> 2000.1200000000001
person it would like literally seem

1997.44 --> 2002.72
like in just a couple of days you just

2000.12 --> 2005.12
see like whoa they continue a lot they

2002.72 --> 2007.159
build a lot and then it's like you don't

2005.12 --> 2009.76
see workers you don't see anything you

2007.159 --> 2012.88
don't see it's just like who half a

2009.76 --> 2015.0
building is there and you go back to

2012.88 --> 2017.7600000000002
sleep then you wake up the next day and

2015.0 --> 2020.039
it's like whoo a giant amount of piece

2017.76 --> 2022.0
is on it's like it built further but you

2020.039 --> 2024.799
didn't hear anything there's no people

2022.0 --> 2027.559
there there's nothing there it just

2024.799 --> 2029.039
expands out of nowhere nobody actually

2027.559 --> 2032.519
get catches a

2029.039 --> 2035.639
glimp of how it's being built but you

2032.519 --> 2038.639
just like surrounded a city is arounded

2035.639 --> 2041.039
and it's just it's there you might see

2038.639 --> 2044.039
some people like checking details or

2041.039 --> 2046.12
whatever but there's basically enormous

2044.039 --> 2050.0
amounts of progress but you don't see

2046.12 --> 2054.48
the people actually building

2050.0 --> 2056.48
it maybe they use some magical way

2054.48 --> 2060.0
to to

2056.48 --> 2062.04
get the job done like that through

2060.0 --> 2064.359
magical

2062.04 --> 2066.24
means and there might be some really

2064.359 --> 2069.359
dark [ __ ] that it gets involved with

2066.24 --> 2072.6389999999997
that too that like oh you want you want

2069.359 --> 2075.119
that Perfection well that requires

2072.639 --> 2078.2400000000002
sacrifice so dark

2075.119 --> 2081.2000000000003
[ __ ] that's what I was

2078.24 --> 2085.4399999999996
thinking I mean these are free masons

2081.2 --> 2085.4399999999996
they do have like this these

2087.079 --> 2093.599
secrets so maybe Free

2090.679 --> 2097.48
Masons is actually like even a hint at

2093.599 --> 2099.76
it it's like yeah just free masonry like

2097.48 --> 2102.52
the Freemasons themselves don't

2099.76 --> 2104.28
particularly even have to be brilliant

2102.52 --> 2108.359
they don't even have to be good

2104.28 --> 2112.599
Architects they just cont let's just get

2108.359 --> 2116.64
it get rough they contact the devil a

2112.599 --> 2119.28
devil whatever be devil hierarchy

2116.64 --> 2121.52
whatever and just like yeah need a

2119.28 --> 2125.5600000000004
building build and that the devil is

2121.52 --> 2128.24
basically a devil isn't the

2125.56 --> 2131.599
architect like they don't even

2128.24 --> 2134.9599999999996
design the thing

2131.599 --> 2137.119
themselves cuz people that are like

2134.96 --> 2139.92
beholding these buildings they're all

2137.119 --> 2143.6800000000003
like how the

2139.92 --> 2147.4
[ __ ] did somebody even design that like

2143.68 --> 2150.3999999999996
it's so insanely elaborate

2147.4 --> 2153.1600000000003
like yeah Freemasons might be smart and

2150.4 --> 2155.92
cool and all that but these buildings

2153.16 --> 2161.8799999999997
are so Overkill like who the hell

2155.92 --> 2165.2000000000003
designed that it seems Overkill so

2161.88 --> 2168.44
maybe supernatural beings did

2165.2 --> 2170.52
it I mean yeah that you just heard that

2168.44 --> 2172.16
I know it sounds really funny and bet

2170.52 --> 2173.4
the trolls are going to have a field day

2172.16 --> 2176.64
with it

2173.4 --> 2179.599
but maybe supernatural beings built

2176.64 --> 2182.4
these gigantic buildings in a surreal

2179.599 --> 2184.6800000000003
way in a record

2182.4 --> 2187.599
time

2184.68 --> 2189.56
because to suggest that all those and

2187.599 --> 2192.28
enormous buildings were just built in

2189.56 --> 2195.96
conventional ways in such a short time

2192.28 --> 2195.96
is absolutely

2201.8 --> 2208.8
Preposterous right so

2204.28 --> 2211.28
that's my alternative idea other than oh

2208.8 --> 2215.88
they were built before that oh really

2211.28 --> 2217.96
how did the tartarians build that H

2215.88 --> 2221.359
let's just get to that like oh the

2217.96 --> 2223.64
previous civilization build how how the

2221.359 --> 2226.0
[ __ ] did they build that then yeah how

2223.64 --> 2227.319
did tartarians build it I mean it's

2226.0 --> 2229.599
equally

2227.319 --> 2231.92
insane how the hell did they build it

2229.599 --> 2234.599
then right I mean even if you have like

2231.92 --> 2235.599
geopolymer and all that Tech like how

2234.599 --> 2239.92
the

2235.599 --> 2239.92
[ __ ] do you build all

2241.079 --> 2246.319
that so

2244.28 --> 2249.599
vast so

2246.319 --> 2249.599
complicated I I

2255.24 --> 2261.04
mean I'm still kind of like holding on

2258.44 --> 2264.52
to the Notions that the terrarians would

2261.04 --> 2267.04
have been just humans well how did just

2264.52 --> 2270.56
humans with more Tech

2267.04 --> 2272.4
available build those buildings I mean

2270.56 --> 2275.04
dude just

2272.4 --> 2277.079
imagine that in this current age a

2275.04 --> 2279.04
building like that would be attempted to

2277.079 --> 2281.44
be built

2279.04 --> 2283.2799999999997
in such a short time like in 2 years a

2281.44 --> 2286.96
giant

2283.28 --> 2289.599
palace with the technology available now

2286.96 --> 2291.839
and let's say like oh yeah so Mason oh

2289.599 --> 2294.2400000000002
yeah we're going to do some geopol we

2291.839 --> 2297.44
just hiding in plight whatever and then

2294.24 --> 2301.16
build it in two years like seriously how

2297.44 --> 2304.359
the [ __ ] do you do that like oh the

2301.16 --> 2309.44
tarians did it how how the hell did the

2304.359 --> 2309.44
tartarians do that it's crazy

2310.28 --> 2313.8390000000004
anyway hello clutch good to see

2313.88 --> 2318.7200000000003
you and J good to see

2323.119 --> 2330.4
you Alexander the Great used the Jin for

2326.119 --> 2332.48
his projects yeah well THC Jack that's

2330.4 --> 2334.119
basically what I'm saying that that

2332.48 --> 2337.119
might have even happened in the Modern

2334.119 --> 2337.119
Age

2338.16 --> 2342.92
and I

2339.24 --> 2347.64
mean Solomon's Temple and all that

2342.92 --> 2350.079
Solomon allegedly also used gin or

2347.64 --> 2353.2
demons for this kind of

2350.079 --> 2356.76
thing so maybe that's something that

2353.2 --> 2356.7599999999998
like the Freemasons still

2358.359 --> 2366.04
know maybe insane fast buildings aren't

2362.16 --> 2366.04
just built by humans

2392.48 --> 2397.44
what what are you guys talking to

2417.599 --> 2425.8
oh Dead redep Redemption okay

2421.8 --> 2425.8
whatever uh

2431.52 --> 2434.44
right so yeah that's

2438.52 --> 2443.88
something that I've been thinking

2441.0 --> 2446.04
of right and I'm going to take a bite on

2443.88 --> 2449.28
Illuminati consone before it gets cold

2446.04 --> 2449.2799999999997
so cheers

2477.72 --> 2481.7599999999998
in the meantime don't forget to rogans

2479.44 --> 2481.76
up the

2483.16 --> 2490.48
show and share it on any non-roll

2486.88 --> 2490.48
platform for him

2507.59 --> 2510.6890000000003
[Music]

2518.359 --> 2524.96
oh and by the way THC

2520.68 --> 2526.7599999999998
Jack like I don't know how much there is

2524.96 --> 2529.359
you should hold weight to what I'm going

2526.76 --> 2529.3590000000004
to say

2530.079 --> 2536.8390000000004
but through my

2533.319 --> 2539.4
past some people have told me that

2536.839 --> 2542.88
Alexander the Great never existed that

2539.4 --> 2542.88
he's a completely fictional

2544.079 --> 2548.6400000000003
character kind of like aredes

2555.96 --> 2561.319
like these are

2558.64 --> 2564.04
characters that were basically designed

2561.319 --> 2567.8
for the far away past based on the false

2564.04 --> 2567.8
history that would be rolled out for

2569.0 --> 2575.68
us like they have

2572.24 --> 2578.24
these designed preceding civilizations

2575.68 --> 2579.44
supposedly for everything that we that

2578.24 --> 2581.9199999999996
we

2579.44 --> 2585.88
know that were effectively made up and

2581.92 --> 2591.48
are a cover for for whole different

2585.88 --> 2591.48
setup and that these unique figures are

2595.28 --> 2602.2400000000002
then thought up as Legends of like the

2599.64 --> 2602.24
further

2605.4 --> 2609.92
past right that's what I've heard and so

2608.16 --> 2612.52
every time I hear Alexander the Great I

2609.92 --> 2615.92
mean it's it's

2612.52 --> 2618.7599999999998
interesting but but it feels like yeah

2615.92 --> 2620.64
it's probably made up like complete

2618.76 --> 2623.6400000000003
complete

2620.64 --> 2626.8799999999997
fiction there was probably no character

2623.64 --> 2626.8799999999997
like that

2666.04 --> 2670.079
what for

2710.4 --> 2716.28
hard to prove well there's one hint

2713.68 --> 2716.2799999999997
about it

2716.88 --> 2723.559
though right I mean supposedly Alexander

2720.119 --> 2727.119
the Great was gay or bisexual or

2723.559 --> 2729.6800000000003
whatever and all every time I see that

2727.119 --> 2732.6400000000003
anywhere like with really prominent

2729.68 --> 2735.64
figures I have like

2732.64 --> 2735.64
strong

2736.52 --> 2741.559
suspicions and with that like the entire

2739.319 --> 2744.2799999999997
supposed ancient

2741.559 --> 2746.4
Greece like oh really ancient

2744.28 --> 2750.76
civilization where that sort of thing is

2746.4 --> 2750.76
normal and and they

2751.839 --> 2757.44
thrived I have some trouble believing

2754.44 --> 2757.44
that

2771.44 --> 2777.96
right and that should be kind of

2774.72 --> 2779.7999999999997
reasonable at this point to to think

2777.96 --> 2782.8
like

2779.8 --> 2786.559
that

2782.8 --> 2789.319
cuz didn't we learn that when you do

2786.559 --> 2792.559
that that that actually like it

2789.319 --> 2792.5589999999997
ruins a

2797.359 --> 2804.92
civilization Newton too no but Newton is

2801.68 --> 2807.44
not that hard to prove he existed I mean

2804.92 --> 2812.359
it's not even that long

2807.44 --> 2812.359
ago it's England I mean I'm

2812.76 --> 2820.44
sorry that's that's not that difficult

2818.04 --> 2822.96
not saying that Newton wasn't made up

2820.44 --> 2826.28
but I'm just saying

2822.96 --> 2829.44
like the chances of there having been a

2826.28 --> 2834.3190000000004
British fella called

2829.44 --> 2834.319
Newton is not that unlikely

2854.8 --> 2860.44
I mean all the letters and everything

2856.8 --> 2865.6800000000003
right I mean that that is actually

2860.44 --> 2870.2000000000003
something huge amounts of letters like

2865.68 --> 2870.2
that that's that really is

2872.359 --> 2877.68
something just like Einstein an actor

2882.359 --> 2887.96
well I don't think like an actor even

2885.4 --> 2892.839
qualifies for somebody that would be

2887.96 --> 2892.839
part of like a history conspiracy like

2904.48 --> 2910.359
that but I think that Newton basically

2907.4 --> 2910.359
got the role

2920.359 --> 2926.839
afterward Shakespeare was Francis Bacon

2924.119 --> 2929.6800000000003
yeah yeah but that's very

2926.839 --> 2934.2799999999997
likely who also wrote

2929.68 --> 2938.2799999999997
the kgv yeah King James Version

2934.28 --> 2938.28
Bible yeah

2946.68 --> 2951.2
all right anyway I'm going to take

2948.319 --> 2951.2
another bite out of

2965.72 --> 2968.72
this

2995.64 --> 2998.64
for

3009.4 --> 3012.599
[Applause]

3025.64 --> 3029.68
e for

3060.839 --> 3069.68
all right so let's adapt the

3064.599 --> 3069.6800000000003
title to what I talked about earlier

3101.839 --> 3108.04
right but yeah just just for a basic

3104.48 --> 3110.079
comparison guys right I mean you have

3108.04 --> 3112.48
probably

3110.079 --> 3114.6800000000003
watched videos from my lunch break and

3112.48 --> 3117.64
you've seen like these colossal

3114.68 --> 3119.48
buildings like colossal

3117.64 --> 3124.44
unbelievably

3119.48 --> 3124.44
big hey check PayPal oh hey

3124.92 --> 3130.839
okay now look at the sagada

3129.04 --> 3133.5589999999997
familia in

3130.839 --> 3137.96
Spain a large

3133.559 --> 3141.3590000000004
Cathedral yeah the S Familia is like

3137.96 --> 3143.799
it's still being built it's being built

3141.359 --> 3147.04
for over a hundred

3143.799 --> 3151.319
years like that's how much

3147.04 --> 3155.04
time it's taken to build that thing

3151.319 --> 3155.92
piece by piece phase by phase yeah and

3155.04 --> 3158.68
that

3155.92 --> 3164.52
building if you really like compare it

3158.68 --> 3165.5989999999997
honestly is way smaller way smaller than

3164.52 --> 3171.079
some of

3165.599 --> 3171.079
these colossal palaces

3171.799 --> 3177.16
colossal and those palaces are like said

3175.04 --> 3180.96
to be built in like

3177.16 --> 3185.44
two to five years or

3180.96 --> 3188.52
something the SAG Familia is still being

3185.44 --> 3190.2400000000002
built it's taken over a hundred years

3188.52 --> 3193.16
and it's

3190.24 --> 3195.4799999999996
smaller than some of these colossal

3193.16 --> 3199.0
palaces that have supposedly been built

3195.48 --> 3204.2400000000002
between 2 and seven years or something I

3199.0 --> 3204.24
mean totally insane

3208.24 --> 3213.839
and I've seen the development of the

3210.2 --> 3217.319
Sada Familia I've seen it in scaffolding

3213.839 --> 3217.319
and everything parts of

3220.72 --> 3229.4399999999996
it I've had very strong suspicions that

3224.2 --> 3232.799
they actually I saw geopolymer casting

3229.44 --> 3236.64
with the S familia in a time when I did

3232.799 --> 3238.2
not know what that was they said it's a

3236.64 --> 3244.7599999999998
special kind of

3238.2 --> 3244.7599999999998
concrete H special kind of concrete huh

3244.92 --> 3247.92
okay

3252.24 --> 3259.24
interesting but it's still even with

3255.079 --> 3262.6400000000003
that being applied it's like taken over

3259.24 --> 3265.64
over a 100 years and it's still not

3262.64 --> 3265.64
finished

3271.559 --> 3278.1600000000003
and then palaces that are like three

3274.0 --> 3282.799
times the size of that entire thing are

3278.16 --> 3285.7599999999998
supposedly buil in two years just insane

3282.799 --> 3285.7599999999998
oh anyway hello

3286.119 --> 3292.2000000000003
thanks

3288.839 --> 3297.0
Martin THC Jack thanks very much for the

3292.2 --> 3297.0
PayPal donation I really appreciate that

3297.2 --> 3299.52
very

3310.44 --> 3317.559
helpful

3312.119 --> 3317.559
awesome hey wrath man it's been ages

3347.319 --> 3352.52
the

3348.96 --> 3352.52
911 all righty

3355.24 --> 3359.2799999999997
then for

3402.16 --> 3406.52
if you want to know what Scott in

3404.119 --> 3409.48
Scotland stands for you just have to

3406.52 --> 3412.4
look into the atmology of

3409.48 --> 3415.839
Scott look look for

3412.4 --> 3419.52
that I mean Scott probably is some word

3415.839 --> 3422.24
for rocks or something not even joking

3419.52 --> 3422.24
it's probably

3425.359 --> 3432.92
like some kind of rock

3428.2 --> 3432.9199999999996
formation it's probably that not a

3433.92 --> 3439.88
person it probably just means like Rocky

3436.92 --> 3441.88
lands and I mean Scotland is a lot of

3439.88 --> 3444.88
mountain so that would make a lot of

3441.88 --> 3444.88
sense

3450.96 --> 3456.839
and Scott

3452.839 --> 3460.48
free would basically be a farmer

3456.839 --> 3462.7599999999998
expression which would mean oh my land

3460.48 --> 3465.119
is free of

3462.76 --> 3467.7200000000003
rocks because that's what Farmers had to

3465.119 --> 3470.4
do with new Farmland they had to get all

3467.72 --> 3472.48
the freaking rocks out of the ground

3470.4 --> 3476.319
especially in Ireland it's pain in the

3472.48 --> 3476.319
ass as a far

3493.599 --> 3498.6400000000003
right so when you figured it out let me

3496.28 --> 3500.96
know if I was right I think I'm right

3498.64 --> 3500.96
about

3505.119 --> 3509.079
this for

3537.28 --> 3540.48
a

3538.319 --> 3546.799
name

3540.48 --> 3546.799
no don't look for it in a name atmology

3568.37 --> 3571.5
[Music]

3581.359 --> 3587.0789999999997
okay Scotland derived from the

3584.96 --> 3591.4
Latin

3587.079 --> 3591.4
scoty a term applied to The

3593.4 --> 3597.76
gales so Scotia

3607.319 --> 3613.799
used by the Roman writers to describe

3610.079 --> 3613.799
the northern gelic group of

3614.52 --> 3617.52
Raiders

3619.92 --> 3626.0
okay so you guess you have to look at in

3623.24 --> 3628.359
in Roman Expressions which makes it all

3626.0 --> 3630.72
very dubious cuz I'm not even sure that

3628.359 --> 3630.72
that was a

3638.68 --> 3646.359
real sque proposing a meaning of a man

3642.64 --> 3646.359
cut off

3651.44 --> 3657.2000000000003
okay so yeah it might be a word for

3654.2 --> 3657.2
outlaw

3657.48 --> 3662.48
like an old Roman word for outlaw

3684.2 --> 3687.27
[Music]

3689.0 --> 3693.4
that would also make sense with Scot

3690.68 --> 3695.359
free like free of Outlaws I mean whether

3693.4 --> 3699.119
it's like rocks in the ground or not

3695.359 --> 3699.119
having outlaws like rob

3699.88 --> 3704.599
you yeah that could work too

3718.96 --> 3722.76
Scottish people ancient Egyptians yes

3721.2 --> 3725.64
wrath that makes

3722.76 --> 3729.92
sense because ancient

3725.64 --> 3734.5589999999997
Egyptians were redheads like Cleopatra

3729.92 --> 3734.559
and like Jesus how dare you

3755.279 --> 3758.279
hello Thomas

3760.359 --> 3765.0389999999998
Larson what what are you talking

3765.119 --> 3771.279
about Antarctica ship in what

3821.4 --> 3825.4
Scotia okay

3850.73 --> 3853.82
[Music]

3862.319 --> 3868.2
someone cut off H could also o mean

3871.64 --> 3876.96
isolation I I was assuming like cut off

3874.68 --> 3883.5589999999997
from the

3876.96 --> 3883.559
law but it could also like be isolated

3905.24 --> 3909.52
hey F outs good to see you

3915.49 --> 3918.56
[Music]

3929.0 --> 3935.48
oops I forgot my

3932.039 --> 3938.599
sound I sometimes get like a runny nose

3935.48 --> 3941.2400000000002
and I can't really understand why I mean

3938.599 --> 3943.48
that and it literally only freaking

3941.24 --> 3946.4799999999996
happens during the live

3943.48 --> 3950.119
show I don't understand

3946.48 --> 3953.599
why like the rest of the day it doesn't

3950.119 --> 3956.52
happen for some

3953.599 --> 3958.48
reason I just get Snee easy or get a

3956.52 --> 3961.52
runny nose during the live show it

3958.48 --> 3964.4
happens like almost every single show

3961.52 --> 3966.72
it's super annoying and just always

3964.4 --> 3966.7200000000003
keeps

3973.68 --> 3978.0
happening all right see you later H

3982.0 --> 3991.52
lunar C cures I don't have a cold Thomas

3987.88 --> 3991.52
lson it's not a

3994.64 --> 4002.359
cold the [ __ ] are you talking about

3998.44 --> 4002.359
wrath why are you bringing up

4014.52 --> 4018.559

4129.6 --> 4136.319
because most of the time it's just made

4131.96 --> 4136.319
up by a troll

4149.279 --> 4156.120000000001
I wish things could patch up no no I

well if he wants to have all these

4212.56 --> 4218.360000000001
freaky fake personalities just to hang

4215.64 --> 4222.280000000001
around me then he's just a sick

4218.36 --> 4227.32
[ __ ] who needs to be

4222.28 --> 4227.32
institutionalized because he's psychotic

4231.4 --> 4236.32
that's his [ __ ] problem like I don't

4233.92 --> 4236.32
care

4253.239 --> 4258.919999999999
man so strange no he's just a disgusting

4260.92 --> 4265.159
scumbag it's not strange at

4272.199 --> 4277.879999999999

4274.88 --> 4277.88
there

4294.04 --> 4300.199
you remember ter wow you've really not

4296.679 --> 4303.6
been around for a long time have you RAV

4300.199 --> 4303.599999999999
yeah he's gone completely

4313.28 --> 4317.239
mental Richard G could see

4343.48 --> 4347.5199999999995
you oh goody hello

4354.679 --> 4359.84
Moxy all right so don't forget the

4356.88 --> 4359.84
Rogan's it up

4360.48 --> 4364.239
guys I only see

4374.12 --> 4378.159
one for

4464.239 --> 4468.04
yeah by the way

4465.6 --> 4471.360000000001
how did you know exactly how did you

4468.04 --> 4471.36
figure that out about

4480.08 --> 4486.639
him besides him giving continual

4483.32 --> 4490.84
[ __ ] Western references to

4486.639 --> 4490.84
nonsense I mean that was kind of a

4492.8 --> 4497.52
hint I mean if you're going to have like

4495.56 --> 4501.360000000001
really

4497.52 --> 4503.96
Bland mainstream Western references all

4501.36 --> 4505.799999999999
the time you're probably some kind of

4503.96 --> 4508.44
stupid Indian

4505.8 --> 4511.56
[ __ ] because that's what they think

4508.44 --> 4511.5599999999995
Western culture is

4515.48 --> 4520.638999999999
like Mikey's Channel

4518.6 --> 4524.8
okay right well thanks for the

4520.639 --> 4524.8
investigation then I guess

4537.84 --> 4544.2390000000005
why he doesn't reach out to me well

4540.159 --> 4547.04
that's why cuz I don't want him here

4544.239 --> 4550.839999999999
ever and I'd appreciate it if you'd kind

4547.04 --> 4553.5199999999995
of like warn me if you figure this

4550.84 --> 4555.52
out a little bit earlier and don't just

4553.52 --> 4557.8
let him hang here that that would be

4555.52 --> 4560.0
great if you actually find that kind of

4557.8 --> 4560.0
thing

4566.36 --> 4571.199
out you just did okay fair

4581.44 --> 4585.159
enough well I'm glad to be rid of him

4583.88 --> 4586.84
because I thought it was kind of a

4585.159 --> 4589.5199999999995
disgusting

4586.84 --> 4592.12
character that just wastes everybody's

4589.52 --> 4594.639
time with stupid nonsense like oh look

4592.12 --> 4597.08
at me playing a video game oh talk about

4594.639 --> 4598.56
the video game oh talk about the cricket

4597.08 --> 4599.92
I should have known from the [ __ ]

4598.56 --> 4601.639
Cricket

4599.92 --> 4605.08
blabber I

4601.639 --> 4607.639
mean you're some guy you talk about

4605.08 --> 4610.719
Cricket I'm probably just going to kick

4607.639 --> 4613.6
you out the next time immediately like

4610.719 --> 4615.6
oh oh you like Cricket okay well bye

4613.6 --> 4617.2390000000005
banned

4615.6 --> 4620.04
that's probably going to happen from now

4617.239 --> 4621.718999999999
on because every time it's a person oh

4620.04 --> 4625.0
they like Cricket well it's [ __ ]

4621.719 --> 4626.639
teret every [ __ ] time so I should

4625.0 --> 4630.92
have

4626.639 --> 4630.92
known I guess I was a bit

4641.719 --> 4647.52
sloppy thought I knew no I didn't I

4644.679 --> 4647.52
didn't didn't realize

4650.32 --> 4660.04
it but I should have I just the thing is

4654.28 --> 4660.04
like I don't really want teret to

4661.239 --> 4670.36
exist so I kind of like don't include

4666.52 --> 4672.280000000001
him in my overall view of reality I kind

4670.36 --> 4676.839999999999
of just like forget about him like

4672.28 --> 4676.84
that's that's how much I care about him

4677.32 --> 4682.799999999999
like as as far as I'm concerned he

4678.92 --> 4686.4800000000005
doesn't exist I keep forgetting about

4682.8 --> 4687.6
him I was actually kind of happy to not

4686.48 --> 4691.04
have

4687.6 --> 4693.320000000001
him try to get in my face for a

4691.04 --> 4695.5199999999995
while but apparently that's because he

4693.32 --> 4697.08
had his stupid sock account and just

4695.52 --> 4700.360000000001
acting like a [ __ ]

4697.08 --> 4703.96
[ __ ] with it when I didn't really pick

4700.36 --> 4706.679
up on it maybe I just wanted that it's

4703.96 --> 4710.8
like yeah it's it's probably ter

4706.679 --> 4713.4800000000005
but if I just like let him be a [ __ ]

4710.8 --> 4715.360000000001
degenerate [ __ ] in my chat like that

4713.48 --> 4718.879999999999
and just let him then he's not going to

4715.36 --> 4723.36
troll me as much I don't know

4718.88 --> 4723.36
why why I did it

4737.48 --> 4743.159

psychopath he wants he wants me to know

4759.04 --> 4765.199
he wants me to know that it's

4767.28 --> 4771.12
[ __ ] little [ __ ]

4787.0 --> 4792.679
scumbag yeah I don't really care about

4822.52 --> 4829.0
really wants to be one of the guys

4826.28 --> 4832.48
just wants to be part of everything so

4829.0 --> 4835.0
much he thinks he has the right to be

4832.48 --> 4835.0

4853.639 --> 4857.6
everything for

4894.76 --> 4901.56

4988.84 --> 4993.8
from a man cut off

5012.28 --> 5014.719

pronounce that

5023.36 --> 5029.199
angas

5025.6 --> 5035.159000000001
mcoin of Glasgow proposed that Scotty

5029.199 --> 5035.159
was derived from the GIC ethon

5039.4 --> 5043.799999999999
Scout

5041.199 --> 5047.678999999999
CH which means

5043.8 --> 5047.679
swarm that could also be

5049.36 --> 5057.159
it that's kind of weird cut off and

5054.159 --> 5057.159
swarm

5062.08 --> 5068.159

5206.639 --> 5211.32
active recently so

5225.239 --> 5231.5599999999995
what are you kidding fiber do I know

5322.08 --> 5327.5599999999995
it in for me now

5324.08 --> 5330.5599999999995
apparently the [ __ ] ter [ __ ]

5327.56 --> 5334.4400000000005
revealing himself Mikey getting

5330.56 --> 5336.360000000001
all horrendous

5334.44 --> 5338.678999999999
he's now convinced that Jesus is a

5336.36 --> 5341.119
pedophile and he's literally sending me

5338.679 --> 5344.96
memes about it the guy is just [ __ ]

5341.119 --> 5347.5199999999995
out of his mind so yeah I don't know why

5344.96 --> 5347.52
why this is

5348.0 --> 5353.199
happening but uh yeah I'm going to like

5351.08 --> 5356.5199999999995
not let it disrupt me and just continue

5353.199 --> 5356.5199999999995
what I do

5368.84 --> 5373.52
everyone has green houses and pictures

5371.52 --> 5376.320000000001
showing off their crops yeah it's all

5373.52 --> 5380.119000000001
the rage now these days fiber

5376.32 --> 5382.639
outs a lot of people do that I mean it's

5380.119 --> 5384.08
a good time to do that to show off that

5382.639 --> 5387.08
you can grow your own

5384.08 --> 5388.719
food and not be dependent on food

5387.08 --> 5391.84
sources

5388.719 --> 5396.04
since Mega Corporation food sources are

5391.84 --> 5396.04
becoming increasingly more

5397.88 --> 5401.719
risky and medled

5403.32 --> 5408.5199999999995
with it's great yeah no it is great of

5416.73 --> 5419.83
[Music]

5422.96 --> 5426.96
course for

5454.199 --> 5457.199
e

5489.96 --> 5494.0
what see bio

5492.14 --> 5497.0
[Music]

5494.0 --> 5497.0
engineer

5498.36 --> 5501.679
really what the

5510.84 --> 5516.88
hell that's that's scary for

5555.96 --> 5560.0
I mean that's like a really weird thing

5558.32 --> 5563.5599999999995
even to say that

5560.0 --> 5565.96
like may contain so it doesn't

5563.56 --> 5571.639
explicitly contain bioengineered

5565.96 --> 5571.639
ingredients but it may what the hell

5577.08 --> 5584.32
I mean I there's like warning labels and

5581.84 --> 5587.0
some types of food is like yeah make

5584.32 --> 5589.48
have like traces of

5587.0 --> 5590.84
peanuts for people that have peanut

5589.48 --> 5593.36
allergy or

5590.84 --> 5596.0
whatever because then peanuts are

5593.36 --> 5598.4
processed in the same

5596.0 --> 5600.96
location and this sounds like may

5598.4 --> 5604.04
contain bioengineered ingredients okay

5600.96 --> 5607.679
so I guess in that location

5604.04 --> 5609.48
there are bioengineered products being

5607.679 --> 5610.92
processed that's what I'm going to

5609.48 --> 5614.718999999999
assume from that

5610.92 --> 5614.719
statement and I mean that's

5621.44 --> 5627.879999999999
crazy you just like him yeah no I used

5625.08 --> 5631.84
to like snakers

5627.88 --> 5635.4400000000005
bars but I kind of quit eating them

5631.84 --> 5639.52
after my teens like last one I ate is

5635.44 --> 5639.5199999999995
like in 2002 I

5642.639 --> 5647.639
think they always gave me like heartburn

5656.4 --> 5663.799999999999
anyway yeah I eat none of that stuff

5660.28 --> 5663.8
like ever

5667.96 --> 5675.4800000000005
like when I switch to organic only

5670.6 --> 5679.4400000000005
diet like all of that crap is all

5675.48 --> 5679.44
gone never touching that

5680.32 --> 5685.84
again like

5682.199 --> 5688.36
dude like the chocolate alone of that

5685.84 --> 5692.28
kind of those types of nonorganic

5688.36 --> 5695.239
products like it stinks to me have like

5692.28 --> 5697.759999999999
a Snickers bar if I smell that it

5695.239 --> 5702.759999999999
literally makes me nauseated

5697.76 --> 5702.76
now cuz it just smells so

5710.88 --> 5719.679
terrible like organic chocolate is just

5716.36 --> 5722.5199999999995
totally different like it's a different

5719.679 --> 5725.04
product as what goes around as supposed

sweets it does have sugar in

it but I mean it's

5842.36 --> 5848.119

food like literally I i' rather feel

5889.96 --> 5896.119
hungry like that's more comfortable to

5893.04 --> 5899.32
me than chugging down non-organic food

5896.119 --> 5899.32
like that

5913.8 --> 5916.719
never heard of it

6845.639 --> 6851.32
right so yeah I'm kind of disappointed I

6847.92 --> 6853.4400000000005
think that freaking teret coming out

6851.32 --> 6856.48
getting kicked out kind of distracted

6853.44 --> 6859.0
everybody away because I was just

6856.48 --> 6863.718999999999
proposing this view on how these

6859.0 --> 6863.719
gigantic buildings would have come about

6866.84 --> 6873.159000000001
I got very little responses from all of

6870.84 --> 6876.52
you over

6873.159 --> 6879.5599999999995
that but I do kind of like Envision like

6876.52 --> 6879.56
they would have just

6880.8 --> 6888.719
like like Rumple Stills can build

6884.76 --> 6892.4800000000005
them right in the night nobody's

6888.719 --> 6894.8
there I mean some like the night watcher

6892.48 --> 6897.959999999999
whatever might even like see it and

6894.8 --> 6900.360000000001
there's like there's this weird light at

6897.96 --> 6901.8
the building it doesn't illuminate

6900.36 --> 6904.199
everything is just this light and it's

6901.8 --> 6906.4800000000005
moving around and then you don't really

6904.199 --> 6908.799999999999
see what's

6906.48 --> 6912.4
there and then the next day you just

6908.8 --> 6912.400000000001
notice like this enormous

6913.76 --> 6920.04
progression like where the hell did even

6916.719 --> 6924.32
all these stone blocks come from like

6920.04 --> 6924.32
you didn't hear anything there's no

6927.079 --> 6930.84
equipment through which you could

6929.04 --> 6933.84
decipher how it would have been

6930.84 --> 6936.599
assembled in the night and just like it

6933.84 --> 6940.159000000001
just keeps getting built like at an

6936.599 --> 6943.04
insanely rapid Pace with

6940.159 --> 6946.0
like nobody knows who's actually doing

6943.04 --> 6948.079
the building and it's super silent and

6946.0 --> 6951.0
it just happens way too quick and then

6948.079 --> 6953.199
people just make up rumors about like ah

6951.0 --> 6955.84
it's the devil building are just these

6953.199 --> 6958.44
crazy Free Masons or it's like oh no no

6955.84 --> 6961.32
they Masons are really with God and they

6958.44 --> 6963.678999999999
get the angels to build the buildings I

6961.32 --> 6965.759999999999
mean that must have like really broken

6963.679 --> 6967.4800000000005
the minds of the people that were around

6965.76 --> 6971.88
at the

6967.48 --> 6973.48
time were they also then declared

6971.88 --> 6975.679
insane

6973.48 --> 6978.5199999999995
right they would just start speaking

6975.679 --> 6980.52
like oh the Free Masons they procured

6978.52 --> 6983.079000000001
the devil to build the building and then

6980.52 --> 6986.400000000001
everybody would be like C right yeah

6983.079 --> 6988.719
yeah yeah no no no that's that's crazy

6986.4 --> 6992.48
God doesn't exist

6988.719 --> 6994.8
Evolution right Evolution proves it and

6992.48 --> 6997.839999999999
all the big bang oh the Big Bang wasn't

6994.8 --> 7002.159000000001
there yet but evolution Theory and all

6997.84 --> 7003.92
that was and darwinian ISM and and those

7002.159 --> 7005.839999999999
people probably would have been like oh

7003.92 --> 7008.92
you're just a religious nutcase and

7005.84 --> 7011.76
we're just not really going to address

7008.92 --> 7013.639
how that monolithic gigantic Palace like

7011.76 --> 7017.119000000001
building

7013.639 --> 7019.28
just was created out of nothing out of

7017.119 --> 7021.119
nowhere in a very short time but just

7019.28 --> 7024.599
not really going to address

7021.119 --> 7027.04
it but if you say something about it

7024.599 --> 7027.04
you're

7028.239 --> 7034.4
crazy I'm just wondering like the people

7031.52 --> 7037.92
of the time that were around like did

7034.4 --> 7037.92
they see it getting

7038.119 --> 7042.5599999999995
built right and this is where it gets

7040.52 --> 7046.119000000001
interesting

7042.56 --> 7049.0
with the uh the Tesla ghost

7046.119 --> 7051.32
phone way to communicate with dead

7049.0 --> 7053.96
Spirits from the past I mean I'd really

7051.32 --> 7057.48
like to make a call to like some people

7053.96 --> 7059.8
in the uh late in the late 18th early

7057.48 --> 7063.678999999999
19th century and like

7059.8 --> 7067.159000000001
hey did you happen to be there when that

7063.679 --> 7068.56
building was getting built or was it

7067.159 --> 7072.638999999999
always

7068.56 --> 7074.4800000000005
there you know some historic

7072.639 --> 7077.4800000000005
I mean a device like that could

7074.48 --> 7079.799999999999
potentially prove extremely useful for

7077.48 --> 7081.5599999999995
historical investigation I mean you

7079.8 --> 7084.28
wouldn't be able to prove anything in

7081.56 --> 7087.92
court with it but I

7084.28 --> 7090.0
mean Spirits if they're intellectually

7087.92 --> 7091.719
cohesive and

7090.0 --> 7096.28
truthful

7091.719 --> 7099.719
could give you the right hints right I

7096.28 --> 7103.48
mean just like oh a guy barely that a

7099.719 --> 7105.36
treasure knew what news what it is and

7103.48 --> 7108.32
then you contact The Ghost and the ghost

7105.36 --> 7110.5599999999995
like uh yeah it's over there and you dig

7108.32 --> 7114.5599999999995
it up and then it's like oh did the

7110.56 --> 7115.639
ghost really tell him where it was we

7114.56 --> 7118.56
don't

7115.639 --> 7120.639
know but you found the treasure though

7118.56 --> 7123.4400000000005
right that's what you should think of

7120.639 --> 7128.32
with like a ghost phone like

7123.44 --> 7130.32
that like you could get the hints you

7128.32 --> 7134.04
could know the secrets that they

7130.32 --> 7134.04
potentially knew

7141.04 --> 7146.599
what the

7142.44 --> 7146.598999999999
Dell I don't know why that

7149.239 --> 7154.28
happened I was just getting a bit

7155.76 --> 7161.4400000000005
piratey since we were talking about bury

7158.84 --> 7163.679
treasure and maybe it's like because of

7161.44 --> 7165.598999999999
that entire discussion of the origin of

7163.679 --> 7170.28
the word

7165.599 --> 7170.28
Scott so blame

7187.92 --> 7193.92
that what Dev SC what the hell are you

7191.679 --> 7196.92
talking about P

7193.92 --> 7196.92
roads

7198.84 --> 7205.679
no just guys

7201.639 --> 7206.400000000001
please just try not to keep piling on

7205.679 --> 7209.4
the

7206.4 --> 7209.4
silly

7209.44 --> 7214.919999999999
please like I'm actually trying to have

7212.599 --> 7217.56
a serious conversation I know it seems

7214.92 --> 7220.4800000000005
to be all hilarious and all that but I

7217.56 --> 7223.679
mean if everybody just keeps joking

7220.48 --> 7226.678999999999
around then nobody Focus is it's

7223.679 --> 7226.679
annoying

7282.4 --> 7286.32
I just put ghost phones in

7287.8 --> 7292.079000000001
there ghost phone

7295.079 --> 7300.36
home would be pretty hilarious if a

7297.48 --> 7304.598999999999
ghost phone would be

7300.36 --> 7307.759999999999
tway it's like once you call a ghost

7304.599 --> 7312.84
up could they call back could you get

7307.76 --> 7314.92
like a ghost stalker that's like oh

7312.84 --> 7316.639
I kind of like conversations with this

7314.92 --> 7318.719
person I'm going to call him back and

7316.639 --> 7321.119
then you keep getting called and it's

7318.719 --> 7323.96
like oh you're having some stalker

7321.119 --> 7328.079
issues do you no it's actually a ghost

7323.96 --> 7330.52
like what yeah I got a ghost

7328.079 --> 7332.5199999999995
troll just won't leave me alone and

7330.52 --> 7334.2390000000005
called him up once for some silly

7332.52 --> 7338.8
question about a building and now he

7334.239 --> 7338.799999999999
won't call stop calling me back

7347.56 --> 7352.079000000001
oh Simon hunt carrots got

7352.52 --> 7358.56
Bann you want to be serious yeah yeah

7356.239 --> 7358.5599999999995
that's

7359.56 --> 7367.0
right I'm yeah it sounds

7362.92 --> 7368.679
silly but uh Apparently that is

7367.0 --> 7371.56
something that was being worked on and

7368.679 --> 7374.4
it's not the first time I've heard that

7371.56 --> 7378.079000000001
that like tech people like Tesla and

7374.4 --> 7381.199
others were working on like a device to

7378.079 --> 7381.199
communicate with the

7381.239 --> 7392.44
dead like a electrified Ouija

7387.119 --> 7392.44
board and it was apparently very serious

7404.159 --> 7409.44
and I'm taking it serious and I'm like

7406.28 --> 7412.36
realizing like it would actually

7409.44 --> 7415.44
potentially be very useful because if

7412.36 --> 7419.0
it's stable not remotely Vis how the

7415.44 --> 7419.0
[ __ ] do you know that carrots got

7419.96 --> 7430.96
banned remotely visible according to

it's like punishing in a way and I do it

7528.04 --> 7530.36
on

7531.44 --> 7537.719

7537.719 --> 7546.199
[ __ ] serious potentially

7541.119 --> 7549.04
scary and then you have to let go of it

7546.199 --> 7553.5199999999995
sounds so funny yeah but it's really

7549.04 --> 7556.4
goddamn serious though yeah

7553.52 --> 7556.400000000001
it's what I like to

7561.36 --> 7567.799999999999
do not a place to be serious well [ __ ]

7565.48 --> 7567.799999999999
off

7568.44 --> 7573.4
then I am a very serious person what I

7571.559 --> 7577.119000000001
do is very

7573.4 --> 7579.5199999999995
serious like I even go ballistic and

7577.119 --> 7582.719
silly because of something that's

7579.52 --> 7586.0
usually very serious

7582.719 --> 7588.2390000000005
I get silly because of seriousness it's

7586.0 --> 7592.159
what I do I am a very serious

7588.239 --> 7595.28
person yeah I don't joke around with

7592.159 --> 7596.96
nonsense I only joke around with really

7595.28 --> 7600.88
goddamn serious

7596.96 --> 7600.88
things to kind of get

7602.28 --> 7608.599
there to draw in attention and then

7605.599 --> 7610.88
literally like put the shackles on you

7608.599 --> 7613.679
and force you to actually take a look

7610.88 --> 7619.52
with the serious is mine

7613.679 --> 7619.52
yeah joke is just a hook the re

7638.559 --> 7645.28
in ghost phon see know and pictures what

7642.0 --> 7648.48
this oh no doubt theyve come by yeah

7645.28 --> 7651.28
sure Optimus I haven't really seen

7648.48 --> 7654.28
pictures of that at Martin Le's Channel

7651.28 --> 7654.28
but I mean it was a

7655.88 --> 7663.92
thing I wonder if they could still be

7660.28 --> 7666.28
used it would be very

7663.92 --> 7670.32
interesting like at this point I'd be

7666.28 --> 7670.32
willing to try it out

7677.199 --> 7682.36
and I think I'd be like the proper

7680.28 --> 7684.599
person to do it because I'd actually

7682.36 --> 7687.5199999999995
take it serious and not act like a

7684.599 --> 7690.2390000000005
[ __ ] [ __ ] teenager that's like so

7687.52 --> 7693.159000000001
funny oh it's all a joke I'm going to

7690.239 --> 7696.558999999999
call something and say something stupid

7693.159 --> 7699.4
no no I take it really damn

7696.559 --> 7701.1990000000005
serious and like like a priest that's

7699.4 --> 7705.558999999999
literally trying to contact the dead

7701.199 --> 7708.36
that's how serious I would take it

7705.559 --> 7710.559
so super duper serious yeah yeah they

7708.36 --> 7713.4
are though

7710.559 --> 7715.96
yeah contacting the dead is a very

7713.4 --> 7715.96
serious

7716.28 --> 7722.8
thing yeah and angels I mean I don't

7719.36 --> 7725.839999999999
know where you're getting that from what

7722.8 --> 7725.84
angels have to do with

7730.239 --> 7735.48
it okay that's kind of funny yet

7743.76 --> 7748.88
ours are only Angels know God from what

7746.88 --> 7751.04
I've seen yeah but there is a God

7748.88 --> 7753.92
because there has to be he's The Keeper

7751.04 --> 7753.92
of the akashic

7755.28 --> 7761.96
record reality couldn't be held together

7758.96 --> 7764.88
without a god

7761.96 --> 7768.559
to keep it

7764.88 --> 7772.28
together to have a uniform

7768.559 --> 7774.719
framework that makes everything fit and

7772.28 --> 7776.36
function throughout

7774.719 --> 7781.84
time

7776.36 --> 7787.799999999999
yeah it's not a matter of perception of

7781.84 --> 7791.88
God no God no structure only chaos and

7787.8 --> 7791.88
yeah no life nothing

7793.32 --> 7798.32
the angels are merely like the

7796.28 --> 7802.32
functionaries they they are the things

7798.32 --> 7802.32
that are performing specific

7803.679 --> 7811.52
tasks they have functions they have

7806.4 --> 7811.5199999999995
maintenance functions for creation

7824.28 --> 7828.88
right so if you're going to supposedly

7827.0 --> 7831.84
communicate with God you're going to

7828.88 --> 7831.84
communicate with an

7833.44 --> 7839.598999999999
Angel that's going to be like the

7836.44 --> 7842.558999999999
spokesperson for God or the avatar for

7839.599 --> 7842.559
God to

7846.679 --> 7850.679
you what

7856.88 --> 7861.079
okay wrath that's pretty messed

7861.44 --> 7867.44
up you don't believe in angels so that's

7864.079 --> 7867.44
your problem

7881.679 --> 7888.119
I'm very very thankful for their

7885.119 --> 7888.119
existence

7897.199 --> 7905.32
yeah he no he it's not

7902.639 --> 7909.0
building

7905.32 --> 7912.0
design and carry through did not give up

7909.0 --> 7912.0
anything

7913.28 --> 7920.48
a long time ago what you think that time

7916.679 --> 7920.4800000000005
applies to God you

7921.4 --> 7927.96
dumbass there is no time that's our

7924.92 --> 7927.96
experience not

7934.44 --> 7938.719
God's oh okay so yeah you have a

7936.88 --> 7941.8
favorite angel even though you don't

7938.719 --> 7943.44
believe in them yeah that's a complete

7941.8 --> 7947.4400000000005
waste of

7943.44 --> 7947.44
time aumu

7988.36 --> 7993.92
oh shut up AA virus delusional [ __ ]

8000.119 --> 8004.079
with e

8032.719 --> 8038.679
wow okay wrath yeah that's pretty messed

8035.679 --> 8038.679
up

8065.44 --> 8071.839999999999
yeah that's insane like you like the

8068.199 --> 8074.558999999999
[ __ ] with who believe doesn't believe in

8071.84 --> 8076.92
Flat Earth and doesn't believe in angels

8074.559 --> 8078.4400000000005
yeah but the Earth is measured flat

8076.92 --> 8082.719
though it is

8078.44 --> 8085.759999999999
flat measured calculated

8082.719 --> 8089.119
navigated perceived

8085.76 --> 8092.400000000001
flat so that is real you're delusional

8089.119 --> 8095.88
about it and yeah what else are you

8092.4 --> 8095.879999999999
delusional about Akuma

8103.159 --> 8107.4
virus want I give a measurement

8107.599 --> 8113.119000000001
90° yeah 90° to the horizon

8133.32 --> 8139.119
okay wrath yeah well it could be I mean

8136.119 --> 8142.239
you can have like a a winged person type

8139.119 --> 8144.0
Vision that is a typical thing that

8142.239 --> 8147.0
people do get to

8144.0 --> 8151.84
see but the Angels

8147.0 --> 8154.199
themselves are not like that

8151.84 --> 8157.079
the Angels themselves are more like

8154.199 --> 8157.079
surreal

8160.04 --> 8165.48
machines 90 in what direction any

8165.76 --> 8170.119000000001
direction just 90°

8197.519 --> 8204.28
oh you don't Richard G okay well you go

8200.559 --> 8207.08
back a retreat to nothingness then

8204.28 --> 8207.08
that's what you want to

8207.599 --> 8214.439
do you go and be lukewarm all you like

8212.439 --> 8217.559000000001
yeah it's not a good thing it's not

8214.439 --> 8217.559000000001
something to be proud

8219.74 --> 8222.819

8424.72 --> 8429.039999999999
you're no longer comfortable making some

8427.52 --> 8431.6
of these statements that the flood

8429.04 --> 8435.92
earthers make like what Richard

8431.6 --> 8439.319
G yeah what are you having doubts

8435.92 --> 8441.84
about no container

8439.319 --> 8448.0
shown what the [ __ ] does that have to do

8441.84 --> 8448.0
with anything no ether what's ether

8453.56 --> 8457.199999999999
no you Earth what the [ __ ] does that

8455.76 --> 8460.2
even

8457.2 --> 8462.560000000001
mean we have no oh so we don't know

8460.2 --> 8465.2
where we are and that means you don't

8462.56 --> 8469.72
know that the Earth is definitely

8465.2 --> 8473.2
flat geometrically oriented measured

8469.72 --> 8474.24
observed and navigated flat oh okay oh

8473.2 --> 8476.52
yeah

8474.24 --> 8479.56
doubts

8476.52 --> 8482.04
sure no it just sounds like you're just

8479.56 --> 8483.479
being a coward

8482.04 --> 8485.880000000001
that's what that sounds like to me

8483.479 --> 8485.88
Richard

8512.319 --> 8515.519999999999
the

8513.76 --> 8519.16
claim

8515.52 --> 8523.84
what I do claim stationary isn't a claim

8519.16 --> 8526.68
it isn't nothing happening is not a

8523.84 --> 8529.399
phenomenon

8526.68 --> 8531.56
dumbass flat until it isn't no the

8529.399 --> 8535.76
geometric orientation of the earth's

8531.56 --> 8538.479
surface is flat not until it isn't it's

8535.76 --> 8540.960000000001
flat the geometric orientation of the

8538.479 --> 8542.599999999999
earth's surface is flat not until it

8540.96 --> 8545.599999999999
isn't it's

8542.6 --> 8545.6
flat

8553.0 --> 8558.479
yeah so you're just being a

8559.72 --> 8565.039999999999
coward yeah rolling

8562.359 --> 8568.319
back you you want to hang around with

8565.04 --> 8570.880000000001

though orientations need containers too

8624.88 --> 8630.479
what the [ __ ] are you okay get the [ __ ]

8627.16 --> 8630.479
out of here

8635.96 --> 8646.039999999999
70% level oceans yeah that's 70% of the

8640.64 --> 8646.039999999999
known Earth surface within this realm is

8646.88 --> 8651.519999999999
water yeah

8649.12 --> 8653.6
that's what's set to be the Earth

8651.52 --> 8656.880000000001
surface yeah

8653.6 --> 8659.12
that's that's water that's like official

8656.88 --> 8661.72
oh it might not be that it might be

8659.12 --> 8664.12
different but I mean that's officially

8661.72 --> 8666.8
the what's the percentage of the earth's

8664.12 --> 8669.6
surface is water so that's what she's

8666.8 --> 8671.96
talking about yeah and it's all flat

8669.6 --> 8674.24
it's all parallel it's all flat in

8671.96 --> 8678.119999999999
relation to the rest of everything that

8674.24 --> 8680.8
is flat yeah the earth's surface is

8678.12 --> 8682.279
parallel to all other parts of the

8680.8 --> 8685.64
Earth's

8682.279 --> 8687.640000000001
surface there's only one geometric

8685.64 --> 8692.319

[ __ ] intellectual

9372.84 --> 9381.880000000001
coward hung around for so

9376.56 --> 9385.199999999999
long got all the arguments to to the N

9381.88 --> 9387.278999999999
detail and then come with this position

9385.2 --> 9390.12

9387.279 --> 9390.12
intellectual

9401.2 --> 9405.6

9533.0 --> 9536.64
bevart I think that that's pretty much

9535.359 --> 9540.04

9536.64 --> 9541.68
now well if you sink that deep then I

9540.04 --> 9543.880000000001

not a

10071.2 --> 10076.240000000002
phenomenon I can claim Earth is

10073.359 --> 10079.720000000001
stationary and and it not being a

10076.24 --> 10082.76
physics claim because it's the claim

10079.72 --> 10086.119999999999
that nothing is happening a claim that

10082.76 --> 10088.319
nothing is happening is not a claim that

10086.12 --> 10090.880000000001
needs evidence to be

10088.319 --> 10093.16
backed it's when you start to claim that

10090.88 --> 10094.24
something is happening that you need to

10093.16 --> 10098.0
back the

10094.24 --> 10101.84

doesn't have to prove it yeah and I gave

10168.64 --> 10175.319
you exactly the reason why because

10172.2 --> 10178.239000000001
stationary is not a claim it's not a

10175.319 --> 10181.0
claim within physics nothing happening

10178.239 --> 10184.199999999999
is not something happening if something

10181.0 --> 10186.359
is happening it's a claim I claim

10184.2 --> 10188.76
something is happening okay prove that

10186.359 --> 10192.04
something is happening I claim nothing

10188.76 --> 10195.319
is happening prove nothing is happening

10192.04 --> 10198.399000000001
how the hell do you prove something that

10195.319 --> 10201.0
doesn't happen like how can you prove

10198.399 --> 10203.96
something isn't

10201.0 --> 10207.16
happening well you'd have to show that

10203.96 --> 10207.16
something is happening

10208.72 --> 10215.88
then in order to have a contrast oh yeah

10213.84 --> 10219.319
I'm not the one making that claim what

10215.88 --> 10221.119999999999
the claim that nothing is happening

10219.319 --> 10224.76
yeah I know

10221.12 --> 10227.640000000001
delard cuz you claim that something is

10224.76 --> 10230.04
happening you claim that Earth moves

10227.64 --> 10234.239
upward

10230.04 --> 10238.479000000001

proof that nothing happens oh really how

10261.76 --> 10266.880000000001
do you suggest I prove nothing happens

10285.2 --> 10292.04
me can you not do that

10289.439 --> 10295.399
please what misrepresenting of your

10292.04 --> 10299.080000000002
claim of motion upward Earth that's not

10295.399 --> 10299.08
happening that you can't

10300.16 --> 10306.439
prove in opposition to my claim that

10304.6 --> 10308.800000000001
nothing is happening for which I do not

10306.439 --> 10311.319
need to provide any proof because it's

10308.8 --> 10314.56
the claim that nothing is

10311.319 --> 10318.278999999999
happening it's effectively not a

10314.56 --> 10318.278999999999
claim it's just a

10323.359 --> 10328.16
statement Richard is Scottish no it's

10325.92 --> 10328.16
not

10328.84 --> 10334.239
Richard where did this or maybe it is

10331.239 --> 10337.359
Richard I just was assuming it's Dell

10334.239 --> 10339.76
because he's talking like Dell and he's

10337.359 --> 10344.04
whining about the clay name of

10339.76 --> 10344.04
stationary that's a Dell

10344.72 --> 10350.438999999998
position and I just explained it like

10348.359 --> 10354.279
several times and he's still holding on

10350.439 --> 10354.279
to it so it's kind of assuming it's

10354.72 --> 10360.239
Dell thought Richard is Canadian I don't

10357.319 --> 10360.239
know what the [ __ ] he

10360.92 --> 10366.76
is I don't care

10364.239 --> 10370.439
anymore right but if this is Richard

10366.76 --> 10370.439
then just [ __ ] off

10370.8 --> 10375.679999999998
yeah you're not welcome here anymore

10372.6 --> 10379.239
Richard you can [ __ ] off now yeah you've

10375.68 --> 10383.2
been [ __ ] off for months now go and

10420.84 --> 10429.0
retain the faculties that they've gained

10424.64 --> 10431.479
in their lives and then actually

10429.0 --> 10431.479
keep

10432.52 --> 10438.0
them I'm so happy that not all the

10435.6 --> 10441.84
people that I've ever gotten to know

10438.0 --> 10441.84
like always lose their

10442.239 --> 10445.76
minds like this

10446.2 --> 10451.720000000001
guy cuz that's what that is it's

10448.84 --> 10452.68
literally like losing your mind gotten

10451.72 --> 10457.039999999999
all this

10452.68 --> 10460.960000000001
info and then it doesn't work anymore

10457.04 --> 10464.359
yeah that's called losing your mind yeah

10460.96 --> 10466.64
if things that make logical sense that

10464.359 --> 10468.319
are argued

10466.64 --> 10471.56
logically

10468.319 --> 10476.439
persistently that have been tested and

10471.56 --> 10478.519999999999
retested and challenged and one over and

10476.439 --> 10480.399
over and over again if suddenly that

10478.52 --> 10483.399000000001
doesn't work anymore in your head well

10480.399 --> 10489.119999999999
guess what you literally lost your

10483.399 --> 10491.358999999999
mind that's what that is yeah if logical

10489.12 --> 10494.439
reality suddenly doesn't make sense

10491.359 --> 10499.279
anymore to you yeah that's not reality

10494.439 --> 10505.399
breaking that's you breaking

10499.279 --> 10505.399000000001

10536.359 --> 10541.6
military scop could be man I don't know

blue pill I don't know doesn't matter

10541.6 --> 10545.399000000001
anymore he's gone

10551.52 --> 10557.08

10553.359 --> 10560.92
surprised if I'm not

10557.08 --> 10563.12
swarmed by military scop [ __ ] all over

10560.92 --> 10564.359
for years I I wouldn't be surprised

10563.12 --> 10568.68
because I

10564.359 --> 10568.68
am kind of psychologically

10573.04 --> 10576.319000000001
aggressive I'm

10576.52 --> 10581.12
headstrong and I dig in

10579.359 --> 10585.2
unusual

10581.12 --> 10588.359
positions in information I do unusual so

10585.2 --> 10592.439
yeah they they like have to be on top of

10588.359 --> 10595.16
it they have to get involved cuz things

10592.439 --> 10597.279
happen and then they know they know they

10595.16 --> 10599.84
can literally have their AI predicted

10597.279 --> 10601.52
that Arn's like something happens Arwin

10599.84 --> 10603.960000000001
just

10601.52 --> 10607.800000000001
immediately

10603.96 --> 10610.08
Strays with that information it's like I

10607.8 --> 10613.08
immedi mediately start digging in entire

10610.08 --> 10616.76
tunnel where most people like would be

10613.08 --> 10620.0
hesitant to go there they'd have to like

10616.76 --> 10622.72
have more information needing to surface

10620.0 --> 10625.319
before they'd feel confident enough to

10622.72 --> 10627.92
take their reasoning into that

10625.319 --> 10631.84
direction I just like oh there's the

10627.92 --> 10633.6
information oh I don't give a [ __ ] about

10631.84 --> 10636.279
what people think if they think I'm

10633.6 --> 10639.04
crazy I'm just immediately going to take

10636.279 --> 10642.560000000001
it and dig

10639.04 --> 10645.84
immediately like I did today it's like

10642.56 --> 10648.0
oh ghost phones oh well how about

10645.84 --> 10651.08
actually entertaining that idea and

10648.0 --> 10654.359
having a practical application and a

10651.08 --> 10658.72
useful utilization Envision for it even

10654.359 --> 10660.960000000001
now yeah that's what I do that type of

10658.72 --> 10664.278999999999
person that does that and does it

10660.96 --> 10666.399
instantaneously upon first confrontation

10664.279 --> 10668.720000000001
is something that un

10666.399 --> 10672.439
Nerfs intelligence

10668.72 --> 10674.16
agencies cuz intelligence agencies want

10672.439 --> 10677.359
to

10674.16 --> 10681.16
control how information spreads and if

10677.359 --> 10684.640000000001
something just has too much wild

10681.16 --> 10687.92
growth unpredictable wild growth that

10684.64 --> 10690.239
ruins their oversight and control that

10687.92 --> 10693.12
makes things harder to control so then

10690.239 --> 10695.64
they will send people over to muddy the

10693.12 --> 10699.52
water to distract

10695.64 --> 10702.16
me right right when I'm to on top of

10699.52 --> 10704.68
things suddenly make stupid silly

10702.16 --> 10707.039999999999
remarks suddenly come out as a

10704.68 --> 10709.08
traitor right because that distracts me

10707.04 --> 10713.720000000001
away from that train of thought that was

10709.08 --> 10718.279
like out of line out of line of what

10713.72 --> 10718.278999999999
they conceive to be as tolerable

10722.6 --> 10728.2
reasoning so that keeps

10725.12 --> 10730.6
happening and today I addressed the a

10728.2 --> 10733.399000000001
bunch of subjects that were highly risky

10730.6 --> 10736.56
risky enough for Tera to suddenly pop up

10733.399 --> 10738.84
and come out and demand all

10736.56 --> 10741.64
attention and then after I kicked him

10738.84 --> 10744.04
out suddenly Richard G just completely

10741.64 --> 10744.039999999999
turn

10744.239 --> 10751.96
coating yeah yeah it's all very

10747.359 --> 10751.960000000001
suspicious it's very suspicious

10775.76 --> 10780.399
you've watched everyone turn on raie I

10778.92 --> 10783.359
don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking

10780.399 --> 10785.72
about with raie ra just doesn't make any

10783.359 --> 10785.720000000001
damn

10786.52 --> 10792.279
sense see really bizarre reasoning and

10794.52 --> 10799.84
positions I mean ra is the kind of girl

10797.359 --> 10802.479000000001
that would be like oh man Terrence

10799.84 --> 10804.960000000001
Howard is like the genius of our era

10802.479 --> 10807.679999999998
like that would be a RI position like I

10804.96 --> 10807.679999999998
don't know

10810.8 --> 10818.199999999999
why why whatever her positions are would

10814.319 --> 10824.0
be taken serious in any way for any

10818.2 --> 10824.0
reason really she's not that

10846.92 --> 10850.960000000001
capable e

10887.56 --> 10891.84
what the hell is that even supposed to

10889.12 --> 10894.12
mean Moxy like what the [ __ ] is your

10891.84 --> 10897.04
point is there some kind of a point

10894.12 --> 10897.04
you're trying to make

10903.92 --> 10909.279
here did his own research yeah and then

10907.04 --> 10912.439
he refused to

10909.279 --> 10915.560000000001
listen yeah what I said is a very valid

10912.439 --> 10919.279
statement yeah about stationary not

10915.56 --> 10921.76
being a claim nothing happening is not a

10919.279 --> 10923.479000000001
phenomenon that you have to provide

10921.76 --> 10928.399
evidence

10923.479 --> 10932.358999999999
for I mean that's not something I made

10928.399 --> 10934.96
up that's real that's how that works

10932.359 --> 10938.0
that's the standard that's like the

10934.96 --> 10940.599999999999
foundation of physics

10938.0 --> 10943.76
comes through that

10940.6 --> 10945.12
reasoning yeah I didn't make that up

10943.76 --> 10947.72
that's

10945.12 --> 10950.239000000001
real it's very inconvenient if you're

10947.72 --> 10951.96
like some kind of presupposing upward

10950.239 --> 10955.16
moving earther or

10951.96 --> 10959.199999999999
whatever then you probably don't like

10955.16 --> 10962.72
it but that is what it is stationary

10959.2 --> 10967.16
isn't a claim it's a description a

10962.72 --> 10967.16
description of nothing happening

out there and you suddenly have like oh

11141.399 --> 11148.399
man I feel this pressure oh

11144.319 --> 11150.76
and I I just can't I feel I I can't

11148.399 --> 11153.358999999999
afford to just call it flat Earth

11150.76 --> 11156.2
anymore I'm going to like just be

11153.359 --> 11159.16
belligerent and just find any way to

11156.2 --> 11160.52
argue that you can't call it flat yeah

11159.16 --> 11163.76
that's called a

11160.52 --> 11167.239
bevard yeah if that's your position

11163.76 --> 11170.12
like that's intellectual cowardice I

11167.239 --> 11172.56
don't want to deal with people like that

11170.12 --> 11174.960000000001
I mean if you have that then you better

11172.56 --> 11178.278999999999
keep it to yourself and consider it as

11174.96 --> 11183.278999999999
your personal intellectual problem

11178.279 --> 11187.12
cuz I don't have respect for that at all

11183.279 --> 11190.720000000001
yeah cuz it's just you trying to be a

11187.12 --> 11193.239000000001
special boy earther trying to avoid

11190.72 --> 11196.399
confrontation with people that have

11193.239 --> 11199.319
spiritual allergic reactions to the

11196.399 --> 11202.039999999999
Declaration that the Earth is flat which

11199.319 --> 11202.039999999999
is what it

11205.479 --> 11210.72
is it's flat

11208.319 --> 11214.399
oh you don't want to call it flat you

11210.72 --> 11216.599999999999
you don't want to submit to that that it

11214.399 --> 11219.358999999999
is measured flat

11216.6 --> 11222.960000000001
everything that's intellectual cowardice

11219.359 --> 11226.56
that means that you no longer want

11222.96 --> 11228.759999999998
to go at at it with the confrontation

11226.56 --> 11228.76
with

11231.2 --> 11235.04
ballards right because every time you

11233.239 --> 11236.56
just say it's flat you're going to have

11235.04 --> 11239.04
these responses you're going to have

11236.56 --> 11241.68
these reactions from these lunatics out

11239.04 --> 11244.76
there they can't help

11241.68 --> 11248.359
themselves they'll band

11244.76 --> 11250.399
together they have like a whole backdrop

11248.359 --> 11254.12
Universe of

11250.399 --> 11256.439
gaslighting that they can unleash on you

11254.12 --> 11259.399000000001
yeah and that's what's that's what it is

11256.439 --> 11261.720000000001
that's what it means to be

11259.399 --> 11265.278999999999
real you want to be real you want to be

11261.72 --> 11268.76
with god with the truth well guess

11265.279 --> 11271.800000000001
what Devil's going to be on your heels

11268.76 --> 11276.56
we're going to GW at your

11271.8 --> 11278.16
heels every damn time that's what it is

11276.56 --> 11280.68
that's the price that's the price of

11278.16 --> 11284.399
being with God of being

11280.68 --> 11284.399
real not backing

11288.08 --> 11294.08
down gaset the G dude Moxy you're just

11292.12 --> 11296.92
one step away just getting

11294.08 --> 11299.039999999999
banned me you do you just want to be

11296.92 --> 11302.88
banned

11299.04 --> 11302.880000000001
you want to join them

11311.01 --> 11314.18
[Music]

11330.72 --> 11335.119999999999
yeah blue pillu it's exactly what it is

11333.04 --> 11337.399000000001
the desired outcome is that we just

11335.12 --> 11339.160000000002
mentally destabilized that we can't find

11337.399 --> 11343.399
our footing anymore that we get

11339.16 --> 11345.2
exhausted and that they can just say

11343.399 --> 11348.72
whatever they

11345.2 --> 11352.399000000001
want without having any

11348.72 --> 11354.479
challenge against it any serious

11352.399 --> 11358.72
grounded

11354.479 --> 11361.08
challenge to have Satan rule yeah so you

11358.72 --> 11364.0
can make up whatever you want claim it

11361.08 --> 11366.039999999999
to be the truth and then just have that

11364.0 --> 11369.439
confirmed because

11366.04 --> 11375.319000000001
nobody has the faculty or the courage or

11369.439 --> 11379.52
the energy left to even look into it

11375.319 --> 11385.6
anymore so that complete delusion can

11379.52 --> 11385.6
just rain without any form of challenge

11406.16 --> 11411.68
yeah yeah I told you not to call me bra

11409.52 --> 11414.319000000001
[ __ ] now you're

11411.68 --> 11416.68
banned so keep making your [ __ ] suck

11414.319 --> 11419.319
accounts I will ban them all I don't

11416.68 --> 11419.319
give a [ __ ]

11421.439 --> 11426.960000000001
anybody else here anybody else wants to

11423.479 --> 11430.039999999999
get kicked out like a [ __ ] [ __ ]

11426.96 --> 11433.039999999999
present yourself I will ban you right

11430.04 --> 11433.04
now

11437.37 --> 11440.419000000002
[Music]

11467.399 --> 11470.399
ah

11506.239 --> 11510.199999999999
for for

11544.319 --> 11550.16
Hello by way ruus didn't see you there

11547.16 --> 11550.16
earlier

11575.479 --> 11578.479
ah

11601.439 --> 11605.64
yeah the chat certainly thinned out

11615.359 --> 11620.6
significantly Optimus you still

11617.92 --> 11622.6
there

11620.6 --> 11627.52
Redman

11622.6 --> 11627.52
Rufus seeking star water

11642.8 --> 11650.119999999999
fibs looking up some law stuff what what

11647.0 --> 11650.12
kind of stuff are you talking

11656.04 --> 11660.080000000002
about for

11704.439 --> 11710.2
oh right yeah yeah yeah no that's true

11706.84 --> 11712.0
Optimus yeah if you're not accused of

11710.2 --> 11716.239000000001
any criminal offense you don't have to

11712.0 --> 11716.239
show your ID that's correct

11719.08 --> 11725.76
although if you're in a

11722.64 --> 11729.88
car that's different though then you

11725.76 --> 11729.880000000001
have to show your driver's license if

11731.319 --> 11735.08
as at least in

11738.84 --> 11742.0
Europe I

11745.92 --> 11749.960000000001
think for

11789.399 --> 11797.439
so yeah today's show primary subject how

11793.239 --> 11797.439
did the tartarians build the monolithic

11798.6 --> 11803.720000000001
palaces how did they actually do it if

11801.16 --> 11807.399
you assume that a previous civilization

11803.72 --> 11809.278999999999
did build them how did they build them

11807.399 --> 11811.278999999999
or were they

11809.279 --> 11815.479000000001
built

11811.279 --> 11817.399000000001
during the yeah the modern civilizations

11815.479 --> 11820.519999999999
era but

11817.399 --> 11822.198999999999
how how did they do that is there some

11820.52 --> 11827.279
weird magical

11822.199 --> 11827.279
process that accompanies the building of

11828.199 --> 11832.6
them right so there's something

11830.359 --> 11834.640000000001
suspicious about these buildings and you

11832.6 --> 11837.960000000001
can take the position that oh they're of

11834.64 --> 11839.0
a previous civilization the terara

11837.96 --> 11840.679999999998
they were

11839.0 --> 11844.56
there

11840.68 --> 11847.960000000001
or they were built in record time in a

11844.56 --> 11847.96
way that's just logically

11849.08 --> 11853.68
impossible how how what it was it built

11852.52 --> 11856.68
so

11853.68 --> 11858.359
that's that's the real question how were

11856.68 --> 11861.479000000001
they

11858.359 --> 11862.84
built that's why it's the main title in

11861.479 --> 11864.56
today's show and that's like the

11862.84 --> 11867.199
question that I'm wondering that I'm

11864.56 --> 11869.479
pondering on we got some free freaky

11867.199 --> 11873.6
ideas about

11869.479 --> 11873.599999999999
it Giants be part of the

11884.72 --> 11890.198999999999
construction I don't think that would

11886.68 --> 11890.199
suffice Optimus I

11890.359 --> 11897.319
mean if it was actually built in those

11893.64 --> 11899.92
times and that quickly then it wouldn't

11897.319 --> 11903.16
matter if you'd have giants like they

11899.92 --> 11905.84
where did they get the materials from so

11903.16 --> 11908.039999999999
quick like yeah giant might be useful in

11905.84 --> 11909.8
lifting a bunch of stuff but still it

11908.04 --> 11911.960000000001
like how the hell could they have done

11909.8 --> 11914.278999999999
it so quickly it's it's just not doable

11911.96 --> 11914.278999999999
it's not

11916.92 --> 11921.52
feasible thinking about the pyramids

11919.239 --> 11923.16
yeah well pyramids is like but yeah

11921.52 --> 11926.92
pyramids is not claimed to have been

11923.16 --> 11929.399
built in recent times like that Al

11926.92 --> 11932.439
though look if they can build Mega

11929.399 --> 11935.0
structures really rapidly magically like

11932.439 --> 11938.960000000001
that then who's to say the pyramids

11935.0 --> 11938.96
weren't like built 300 years

11939.72 --> 11946.76
ago and it's just that we can't believe

11943.0 --> 11946.76
it we just can't believe

11951.16 --> 11957.199
it like where do these Mega structures

11954.479 --> 11959.08
come from how have they suddenly popped

11957.199 --> 11962.560000000001
out of nowhere so

11959.08 --> 11965.68
quickly and if they didn't if they were

11962.56 --> 11967.72
always there then how were they built

11965.68 --> 11970.720000000001
when they exist like when they were

11967.72 --> 11970.72
built

11987.0 --> 11994.479
electricity that makes modern day look

11991.52 --> 11997.0
like it's not the same thing mastering

11994.479 --> 11999.119999999999
electricity they used electricity in a

11997.0 --> 12002.6
completely different type of

11999.12 --> 12006.720000000001
way it's like they

12002.6 --> 12009.239
used macro Electronics yeah we use micro

12006.72 --> 12011.519999999999
Electronics with computers they used

12009.239 --> 12014.439
macro

12011.52 --> 12018.560000000001
Electronics so they use electrics in a

12014.439 --> 12018.56
completely different way

12019.92 --> 12028.239
they just used the buildings

12023.56 --> 12032.119999999999
to get the energy going that basically

12028.239 --> 12032.119999999999
infuses people and

12032.359 --> 12039.0
life it's a completely different type of

12035.76 --> 12039.0
application of

12045.52 --> 12049.319000000001
electrics right right but that's not

12047.72 --> 12051.92
really like

12049.319 --> 12054.0
that's you can't even really like

12051.92 --> 12056.319
compare it like micro Electronics is

12054.0 --> 12059.12
just completely different it's a fractal

12056.319 --> 12060.278999999999
inward thing that can just keep

12059.12 --> 12062.92
developing

12060.279 --> 12065.52
forever like micro Electronics keep

12062.92 --> 12069.08
getting smaller and smaller and smaller

12065.52 --> 12072.0
macro Electronics does not it's just

12069.08 --> 12074.479
what it is it works the way it does it

12072.0 --> 12078.04
seems to have been

12074.479 --> 12080.319
perfected and

12078.04 --> 12082.92
it's just what it

12080.319 --> 12085.6
is it's not something that just keeps

12082.92 --> 12089.239
developing and

12085.6 --> 12093.68
developing it's just applied the correct

12089.239 --> 12093.68
way and then it just works the way it

12093.76 --> 12098.76
works you can't really see like a

12096.52 --> 12101.0
development curve on the F on the on

12098.76 --> 12101.0
those

12104.88 --> 12110.358999999999
functions while the develop curve on

12107.56 --> 12114.08
micro Electronics is very obvious and

12110.359 --> 12114.08
historically recorded

12163.239 --> 12168.198999999999
all right I think I'm going to round out

12165.239 --> 12169.84
the show it's been going for a while 3

12168.199 --> 12172.279
hours 20

12169.84 --> 12175.0
minutes I take a 2-minute break and then

12172.279 --> 12178.09
I'm going to round out so see you

12175.0 --> 12178.09

undercover and that keeps

12434.239 --> 12439.68
happening sometimes she just got to wash

12436.439 --> 12442.960000000001
it all off and leave room for some new

12439.68 --> 12442.960000000001
people like red men

12451.52 --> 12457.76
here right so

12454.68 --> 12460.359
yeah any newcomer that's like been

12457.76 --> 12462.04
holding back CU there's some people that

12460.359 --> 12465.04
you didn't really trust that you thought

12462.04 --> 12466.76
were kind of shady well I kicked them

12465.04 --> 12470.76
out it's your

12466.76 --> 12473.64
time to uh to be part of the chat now is

12470.76 --> 12473.64
all the room in the

12475.279 --> 12480.04
world right so anyhow I'll be back

12478.239 --> 12482.16
tomorrow with flat Earth early bird

12480.04 --> 12484.6
number

12482.16 --> 12488.96
1973 on a

12484.6 --> 12488.960000000001
Monday hope to see you all

nice day where you're at with nice

12499.64 --> 12503.76
weather

12500.84 --> 12506.76
it's come a bit more cloudy over here

12503.76 --> 12508.76
still very windy I think it's probably

12506.76 --> 12512.880000000001
going to rain a little bit later it did

12508.76 --> 12515.399
it did so it did yesterday as

12512.88 --> 12517.198999999999
well the evening it was raining but in

12515.399 --> 12519.08
the night it was very clear sky they

12517.199 --> 12521.279
even had like a bunch of
