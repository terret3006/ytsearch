114.479 --> 119.67999999999999
similar to yesterday

116.88 --> 122.32
it's a bit misty but not really deep in

119.68 --> 124.32000000000001
big gray soup up there

122.32 --> 127.63999999999999
kind of cold

124.32 --> 127.63999999999999
kind of moist

129.599 --> 135.64
not the most appealing weather

132.08 --> 135.64000000000001
to be outside

142.4 --> 144.87900000000002
it'll do

149.52 --> 154.16
hello psych bear first in chat

152.48 --> 156.48
good to see you

154.16 --> 161.07999999999998
on this saturday

156.48 --> 161.07999999999998
the 15th of january 2022

162.319 --> 165.599
started a little late

166.239 --> 169.68
yeah because i

167.44 --> 171.68
had it really

169.68 --> 174.56
a long sleep

171.68 --> 176.64000000000001
yeah no nobody was working like

174.56 --> 178.56
downstairs this morning

176.64 --> 181.2
so i really like

178.56 --> 181.2
slept out

182.08 --> 186.15900000000002
pretty much into what is it

187.28 --> 191.92
half past one i really enjoyed it though

192.4 --> 194.959
very

193.84 --> 197.36
resting

194.959 --> 200.72
my body feels very rested

197.36 --> 201.76000000000002
my mind also decently

200.72 --> 206.519
i even

201.76 --> 206.519
had lunch before i started the show

214.239 --> 216.56
right

216.959 --> 219.28
so

222.64 --> 228.55999999999997
where is the rest

225.519 --> 230.239
anyway yeah yesterday's show was great

228.56 --> 232.799
i haven't watched it back i've barely

230.239 --> 235.04
watched anything back of myself in a

232.799 --> 235.04000000000002
while

235.28 --> 240.439
i don't seem to be finding the time for

237.439 --> 240.439
it

243.04 --> 247.599
even though i i'm pretty sure i've got

244.879 --> 249.439
some good shows

247.599 --> 251.51899999999998
some good performances interesting

249.439 --> 255.48
things i laid down

251.519 --> 255.48000000000002
in a recent few shows

256.799 --> 261.44
but yeah just

258.239 --> 261.44
i don't have the time

262.639 --> 267.759
or like not the mood for it

265.759 --> 271.28000000000003
maybe i'll just get back to all that

267.759 --> 274.47900000000004
when springtime started

271.28 --> 274.479
uh anyway

274.88 --> 279.759
brian's logic uploaded a video this

277.84 --> 283.67999999999995
night i haven't seen it yet though it

279.759 --> 287.759
seems very technical again

283.68 --> 287.759
i'll take a peek later on today

287.84 --> 293.75899999999996
flat earth debates yesterday was great

290.88 --> 295.52
it was really a lot of fun

293.759 --> 299.44
basically the continuation of what it

295.52 --> 299.44
was like on the thursday show

300.56 --> 306.72
it's being made out for a polonium

303.039 --> 308.4
people denier and all that again

306.72 --> 309.6
so it was kind of goofy but still

308.4 --> 314.919
interesting

309.6 --> 314.91900000000004
hey crockett mike sidoonich stone monkey

327.36 --> 331.12
right but yesterday's flatters debate i

329.36 --> 333.91900000000004
was not

331.12 --> 333.919
too chatty

336.96 --> 340.4
i mostly just listened

340.72 --> 344.72
ah

342.4 --> 346.71999999999997
right i was just also watching owen

344.72 --> 351.40000000000003
benjamin

346.72 --> 351.40000000000003
talking about that tyrannical feminine

354.32 --> 360.15999999999997
cut through about a half an hour

357.52 --> 360.15999999999997
good points

361.44 --> 365.6
it's like the tyrannical feminine is

363.36 --> 367.759
something i definitely

365.6 --> 370.16
try to avoid

367.759 --> 372.639
because i find that extremely

370.16 --> 374.72
unattractive

372.639 --> 376.56
so every time owen benjamin says that's

374.72 --> 378.96000000000004
in every woman

376.56 --> 381.84
and i'm my immediate instinctual

378.96 --> 383.84
response internally is yeah you better

381.84 --> 386.08
[ __ ] hide it

383.84 --> 390.19899999999996
i don't want to see that ever

386.08 --> 390.19899999999996
i find that highly repulsive

395.68 --> 398.88
all right

396.8 --> 401.52000000000004
but it's it's interesting

398.88 --> 403.36
owen does know a lot about that behavior

401.52 --> 405.84
type

403.36 --> 407.68
yeah yeah hey guns have never owned rmp

405.84 --> 410.56
good to see you yes i did check my

407.68 --> 413.36
paypal this morning and

410.56 --> 416.56
thank you very much that's gonna

413.36 --> 416.56
get me through the weekend

417.039 --> 420.28
thank you

428.4 --> 432.79999999999995
yes

430.479 --> 432.8
about

433.199 --> 436.40000000000003
a week and two more days and then i'll

435.44 --> 440.319
be

436.4 --> 440.31899999999996
financial safe zone for a while

440.639 --> 446.24
but yeah until that time i'm going to be

442.88 --> 446.24
pretty much dependent on

446.639 --> 450.72
what my viewers and

449.199 --> 452.08
people that follow me through the flat

450.72 --> 454.08000000000004
earth debates what they're gonna throw

452.08 --> 457.12
at me

454.08 --> 459.039
for the next uh what is it

457.12 --> 462.72
14 days

459.039 --> 462.71999999999997
so please anybody listening

462.96 --> 469.75899999999996
don't forget to sponsor your local arwyn

465.36 --> 469.759
or he's going to basically crash

471.52 --> 475.919
because of a lack of food

473.599 --> 477.68
right anyway yeah thanks

475.919 --> 481.35999999999996
thanks for being that supporter gunther

477.68 --> 482.879
neverone really appreciate that

481.36 --> 485.28000000000003
you need coffee

482.879 --> 485.28000000000003
okay

491.68 --> 493.84000000000003
um

495.48 --> 498.649
[Music]

516.64 --> 523.279
hey random explorer good to see you

520.399 --> 523.279
bob wilson

525.04 --> 528.959
does my state welfare no no it doesn't

527.76 --> 532.399
it

528.959 --> 535.8389999999999
wilson it does not provide enough for me

532.399 --> 539.279
it never has

535.839 --> 542.24
it's always like a skeleton support

539.279 --> 543.8389999999999
and what they want you or expect you to

542.24 --> 544.8
do

543.839 --> 547.6
is

544.8 --> 549.68
to basically mark yourself as having

547.6 --> 552.32
problems oh i got this

549.68 --> 553.1999999999999
condition oh i got that condition and

552.32 --> 556.5600000000001
then

553.2 --> 558.88
you may go almost literally go on your

556.56 --> 561.1999999999999
knees to a bunch of social workers

558.88 --> 563.92
specifically designated to do that to

561.2 --> 564.88
see if you can get some extra funding in

563.92 --> 568.0
which

564.88 --> 571.519
you return you will be treated like a

568.0 --> 575.279
literal insane asylum patient

571.519 --> 577.44
and disrespect it and manipulate it

575.279 --> 579.72
and you will get the front line when it

577.44 --> 582.32
comes to social engineering so they're

579.72 --> 584.32
immediately gonna try to force jabs on

582.32 --> 585.7600000000001
you yeah yeah yeah

584.32 --> 587.6
that's what happens

585.76 --> 589.279
if i go beyond

587.6 --> 591.44
the skeletal

589.279 --> 593.8389999999999
input

591.44 --> 595.9200000000001
for yeah which i have constitutional

593.839 --> 598.0
right actually that's really funny about

595.92 --> 600.399
the netherlands we literally have

598.0 --> 603.12
constitutional right

600.399 --> 606.32
for basic social welfare

603.12 --> 609.04
to get around for the basic only

606.32 --> 611.36
if you want more and you can get more

609.04 --> 616.399
you're gonna have to literally

611.36 --> 618.72
degenerate yourself like a pet or a dog

616.399 --> 621.92
and then you have no more time you'll

618.72 --> 624.399
have no more peace of mind trust me

621.92 --> 627.12
because my friend from naimei

624.399 --> 628.959
fell into that trap since she's a single

627.12 --> 632.399
mother and she

628.959 --> 635.4399999999999
constantly constantly

632.399 --> 638.24
is confronted with hellish

635.44 --> 639.9200000000001
social situations

638.24 --> 642.9590000000001
because of it

639.92 --> 644.7199999999999
so i don't do that

642.959 --> 646.2399999999999
i i have to

644.72 --> 648.32
beg

646.24 --> 649.76
the viewers here

648.32 --> 651.6800000000001
to get my

649.76 --> 655.88
to get what i really need to get around

651.68 --> 655.88
and that's just the way it is

669.36 --> 674.48
yeah that's right it is a completely

671.6 --> 677.2
broken system and i am really [ __ ]

674.48 --> 680.48
pissed off at it i'm like seriously

677.2 --> 682.88
pissed off that that's like that

680.48 --> 684.8000000000001
like i am offended when people tell me

682.88 --> 686.48
that oh but you can't get more you just

684.8 --> 688.7199999999999
have to do this and that and i'm like

686.48 --> 691.6
you're a degenerate

688.72 --> 693.44
you deserve to die for your weakness

691.6 --> 694.48
that's my response

693.44 --> 698.48
yeah

694.48 --> 700.48
don't actually say it to them because

698.48 --> 703.04
what's the point but that's what i'm

700.48 --> 705.839
thinking so like oh oh you want just a

703.04 --> 709.519
little bit more from the state so you'll

705.839 --> 712.0
literally mark yourself with the plague

709.519 --> 714.0
and you're we well you're a degenerate

712.0 --> 715.519
like an actual

714.0 --> 719.12
degenerate

715.519 --> 721.44
and often they do start to look and talk

719.12 --> 723.76
like degenerates

721.44 --> 725.839
that you want like i don't want this guy

723.76 --> 727.68
close to me

725.839 --> 731.12
like those were the guys that would be

727.68 --> 734.2399999999999
kicked out of the city 500 years ago to

731.12 --> 734.24
go live in the woods

734.959 --> 738.56
right

736.639 --> 740.24
those types of people

738.56 --> 741.76
they would then end up like robbers and

740.24 --> 745.44
[ __ ] and get killed

741.76 --> 748.8
right degenerates i hate that

745.44 --> 750.9590000000001
i hate it it's evil that it works that

748.8 --> 753.68
way it's evil

750.959 --> 757.5189999999999
should not work that way ever

753.68 --> 760.6389999999999
and [ __ ] basic income [ __ ] is not

757.519 --> 763.279
gonna fix it or replace it either and

760.639 --> 766.8
make it better it won't

763.279 --> 770.56
needs to be completely different

766.8 --> 770.56
and i've discussed this

771.279 --> 775.2
among countrymen

773.2 --> 776.9590000000001
for like 20 years

775.2 --> 778.72
like this is wrong

776.959 --> 781.04
this is wrong this is wrong this is

778.72 --> 782.8000000000001
wrong like if you really mean it then

781.04 --> 783.92
just [ __ ] shoot them in the head

782.8 --> 785.3599999999999
already

783.92 --> 787.04
right

785.36 --> 790.32
but to literally

787.04 --> 791.68
force people to dilapidate their social

790.32 --> 793.7600000000001
status and

791.68 --> 795.68
get real eroded into

793.76 --> 798.399
taking drugs

795.68 --> 801.3599999999999
like anti-anxiety whatever drugs make

798.399 --> 803.44
them addicted to pharmaceuticals because

801.36 --> 806.0
they have a condition because they need

803.44 --> 808.8800000000001
to register that condition just to get a

806.0 --> 812.639
little few extra dimes to get around

808.88 --> 815.12
that's [ __ ] sick it's like

812.639 --> 819.12
a pimp

815.12 --> 821.04
putting heroin in his horse

819.12 --> 825.04
right that's what it's like to me it's

821.04 --> 826.079
so disgusting i hate it i savagely hate

825.04 --> 828.0
it

826.079 --> 830.2399999999999
and i think that the people that engage

828.0 --> 832.959
with that are degenerates and should be

830.24 --> 836.24
ejected from the country

832.959 --> 840.279
like those are our cave crabblers weak

836.24 --> 840.279
pathetic people

850.0 --> 852.959
so yeah it's safe to say i've never ever

851.92 --> 856.399
done that

852.959 --> 858.4799999999999
i'd rather live with some hunger i

856.399 --> 860.56
really do i'd rather live with some

858.48 --> 863.1990000000001
hunger for a while

860.56 --> 864.7199999999999
than to allow myself to be

863.199 --> 866.56
dilapidated

864.72 --> 868.48
in that fashion

866.56 --> 870.7199999999999
just to get an extra few dimes from the

868.48 --> 873.6
system it's so disgusting

870.72 --> 873.6
it's like dude

874.8 --> 878.959
why didn't you just [ __ ] execute them

876.959 --> 882.0
already

878.959 --> 884.8
it's so evil to just force them into

882.0 --> 887.04
some psychological profile

884.8 --> 889.5999999999999
put them on drugs

887.04 --> 891.92
and they'll do it just to get a few bits

889.6 --> 894.5600000000001
of extra money not because they really

891.92 --> 894.56
needed it

894.639 --> 900.24
or they were really having such heavy

897.519 --> 902.399
mental issues that they couldn't just

900.24 --> 905.44
deal with without

902.399 --> 907.76
medical intervention

905.44 --> 909.519
but yeah they turn into dilapidated

907.76 --> 911.4399999999999
people it's so

909.519 --> 914.32
evil

911.44 --> 916.24
it's more evil than basically nazis

914.32 --> 918.8000000000001
executing somebody on the side of the

916.24 --> 921.279
streets in my opinion it's more evil

918.8 --> 921.279
than that

924.32 --> 928.24
every time i think about it i start to

926.399 --> 932.44
gnash my teeth

928.24 --> 932.44
it's so [ __ ] evil

947.199 --> 950.3199999999999
anyway that's certainly got the room

949.199 --> 953.959
going

950.32 --> 953.9590000000001
thank you for that

954.079 --> 958.5999999999999
question remark bob wilson

977.12 --> 981.759
all right

978.639 --> 984.32
but yeah the way it's applied

981.759 --> 986.5600000000001
you could definitely say that

984.32 --> 989.44
the socialism

986.56 --> 994.8
welfare system as how it's become is

989.44 --> 994.8000000000001
actually a eugenics depopulation arm

994.839 --> 1000.399
program yeah

997.279 --> 1002.88
the current day applied social welfare

1000.399 --> 1005.399
systems around the western world

1002.88 --> 1007.92
are actually eugenics

1005.399 --> 1009.759
depopulation programs

1007.92 --> 1011.04
yeah it is

1009.759 --> 1012.48
palpably

1011.04 --> 1015.68
provably

1012.48 --> 1017.1990000000001
because of what happens to the people

1015.68 --> 1018.6389999999999
that

1017.199 --> 1021.3599999999999
stick to that

1018.639 --> 1022.88
what happens to them are they

1021.36 --> 1024.48
the same

1022.88 --> 1027.28
20 years later

1024.48 --> 1029.439
you try and find somebody that goes on

1027.28 --> 1032.24
social welfare

1029.439 --> 1035.439
and then reaches deeper

1032.24 --> 1036.4
who's the same 20 years later they're

1035.439 --> 1039.8390000000002
not

1036.4 --> 1042.0790000000002
they're always either mentally deranged

1039.839 --> 1045.28
physically degenerated

1042.079 --> 1048.319
super anti-social isolated

1045.28 --> 1048.319
drug addicts

1049.6 --> 1055.28
they're [ __ ]

1050.88 --> 1057.2
every time every time they dig deeper

1055.28 --> 1058.32
then that just minimum amount to get

1057.2 --> 1060.16
around

1058.32 --> 1065.48
they're [ __ ]

1060.16 --> 1065.48
every single time they're [ __ ]

1070.16 --> 1074.24
right

1071.52 --> 1076.08
now one way to avoid that is to actually

1074.24 --> 1078.88
do something with your time that's

1076.08 --> 1082.3999999999999
productive for which there is a market

1078.88 --> 1085.5200000000002
and then gather the money

1082.4 --> 1089.2800000000002
on a voluntary basis from participants

1085.52 --> 1089.28
and that is what i'm trying to do here

1089.52 --> 1094.799
i think that's a much more

1092.48 --> 1098.0
it's going to yield a much better result

1094.799 --> 1099.9189999999999
like in 20 years time since i

1098.0 --> 1101.52
started that like what is it eight nine

1099.919 --> 1103.76
years ago

1101.52 --> 1105.84
i am going to be pretty much the same

1103.76 --> 1107.44
and improved i'm not going to be a

1105.84 --> 1109.4399999999998
deranged

1107.44 --> 1112.48
junkie freak

1109.44 --> 1114.3200000000002
that's like teetering in their health

1112.48 --> 1115.919
no i'm going to be fine

1114.32 --> 1118.8799999999999
because i didn't

1115.919 --> 1122.16
go the extra depth

1118.88 --> 1125.0390000000002
into the welfare system

1122.16 --> 1128.4
and take on medical conditions to get a

1125.039 --> 1128.4
little bit of extra money

1131.919 --> 1136.44
hey elise g good to see you

1150.24 --> 1153.619
um

1150.53 --> 1153.619
[Music]

1155.2 --> 1158.559
right

1156.0 --> 1161.84
so yeah

1158.559 --> 1161.84
when i say what i do

1161.919 --> 1167.44
is good i like this setup

1165.12 --> 1169.6789999999999
i'm not trying to escape from it well

1167.44 --> 1172.3200000000002
there's plenty of reasons why i like

1169.679 --> 1174.48
this setup of what i'm doing

1172.32 --> 1176.799
and yeah i think i've explained most of

1174.48 --> 1179.679
it by now

1176.799 --> 1182.4
there's really nowhere to go

1179.679 --> 1184.4
unless i'm willing to basically

1182.4 --> 1187.44
sacrifice my own

1184.4 --> 1189.8400000000001
person and cohesion and health

1187.44 --> 1192.48
yeah because you can always get more

1189.84 --> 1194.48
money if you're willing to

1192.48 --> 1196.08
die for it

1194.48 --> 1198.559
on the short run

1196.08 --> 1202.48
there's always ways to get more money if

1198.559 --> 1207.32
you are willing to literally die

1202.48 --> 1207.32
yeah because it's a eugenic system

1210.08 --> 1216.1589999999999
but i just want to keep going that's

1212.32 --> 1218.32
what i want i want to maintain cohesion

1216.159 --> 1220.48
i want to improve what i've been

1218.32 --> 1222.48
building already

1220.48 --> 1224.96
my skills

1222.48 --> 1228.64
my confidence

1224.96 --> 1228.64
and i want to maintain my health

1229.76 --> 1234.36
right hello daniel robles

1242.0 --> 1248.2
yeah psych bear

1243.76 --> 1248.2
don't know why you come in with that

1249.28 --> 1254.799
but yeah and safe to say i'm not gonna

1251.28 --> 1256.8799999999999
talk about that today psych bear

1254.799 --> 1259.2
with bob

1256.88 --> 1260.96
that thing that happened like years and

1259.2 --> 1264.0800000000002
years and years ago

1260.96 --> 1267.039
but yeah there was a situation

1264.08 --> 1269.36
and bob's still squirting over that i

1267.039 --> 1272.559
basically spoke out about that like he

1269.36 --> 1274.3999999999999
still does that every time

1272.559 --> 1278.6399999999999
he thinks

1274.4 --> 1281.2800000000002
back on everyday or me he always brings

1278.64 --> 1284.0800000000002
that up like how dare you accuse me of

1281.28 --> 1284.799
being apologist for blah blah blah

1284.08 --> 1286.8799999999999
like

1284.799 --> 1288.96
he's said it more

1286.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
combined in air time

1288.96 --> 1294.4
in public on shows we've talked about it

1291.84 --> 1298.08
more than the actual time i spent

1294.4 --> 1299.039
talking about it on video

1298.08 --> 1301.76
really

1299.039 --> 1304.8799999999999
spent more time complaining about

1301.76 --> 1306.64
dimension about that altogether online

1304.88 --> 1311.0
then i've actually talked about it

1306.64 --> 1311.0
online isn't that just amazing

1321.44 --> 1324.559
i have any problems with someone needing

1323.039 --> 1327.919
help it's just when they make it their

1324.559 --> 1330.72
lifestyle well lifestyle is

1327.919 --> 1333.3600000000001
when you make a habit of manipulating

1330.72 --> 1335.76
people out of their money

1333.36 --> 1338.1589999999999
that's when i get a problem with it too

1335.76 --> 1340.1589999999999
if you're like no i'm just going to put

1338.159 --> 1342.96
on

1340.159 --> 1345.2800000000002
poor man's clothes and literally beg for

1342.96 --> 1347.76
money and oh i'm so poor and i'm so

1345.28 --> 1350.32
acting in like a good end like in acting

1347.76 --> 1352.32
like i'm a [ __ ] and i need help and

1350.32 --> 1354.72
then get money and then as soon as you

1352.32 --> 1356.72
got what you want you move away you put

1354.72 --> 1360.559
on your good clothes again

1356.72 --> 1363.76
and you just use it like that's evil

1360.559 --> 1363.76
that's manipulating

1364.48 --> 1370.159
i agree psych bear i don't do that i am

1367.679 --> 1372.64
actually this poor

1370.159 --> 1375.2800000000002
and i'm not even that poor right i'm

1372.64 --> 1380.2
poor maybe by dutch standards by by

1375.28 --> 1380.2
world standards i am not poor at all

1390.96 --> 1394.48
critics of the welfare system are

1392.88 --> 1399.0800000000002
clueless

1394.48 --> 1399.08
what do you mean guns have never owned

1424.72 --> 1428.88
okay wrath that seems weird daughter of

1427.76 --> 1431.84
a cereal

1428.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
what

1432.799 --> 1435.279
okay

1439.84 --> 1442.799
like

1440.559 --> 1442.799
what

1443.44 --> 1449.44
and no i did not see the fight to flat

1445.6 --> 1449.4399999999998
earth i don't watch fight the flat earth

1451.12 --> 1454.799
because every time it's a waste of my

1453.44 --> 1457.3600000000001
time

1454.799 --> 1459.84
i'd rather just watch sesame street or

1457.36 --> 1459.84
something

1462.96 --> 1467.6000000000001
not that i particularly like watching

1465.12 --> 1469.4399999999998
that it's just that that would be less a

1467.6 --> 1472.76
waste of my time than watching fight the

1469.44 --> 1472.76
flat earth

1482.96 --> 1489.1200000000001
yeah but i did hear that he's put out a

1486.24 --> 1491.1200000000001
sexton challenge oh now the anti-flat

1489.12 --> 1493.1999999999998
earthers are gonna

1491.12 --> 1495.6
do a saxon challenge if they're all

1493.2 --> 1498.48
gonna do a sexton challenge so they can

1495.6 --> 1500.48
insert their nonsense reasoning on how

1498.48 --> 1502.72
you don't need the horizon

1500.48 --> 1504.96
for a sex that's what they're gonna try

1502.72 --> 1506.48
even though that's not how you even use

1504.96 --> 1508.88
the sextant

1506.48 --> 1511.039
for hundreds of years

1508.88 --> 1513.3600000000001
so they're just gonna hold on to their

1511.039 --> 1516.48
little micro machination and then

1513.36 --> 1519.52
pretend oh see you can use the sections

1516.48 --> 1520.559
in a globe you can use it

1519.52 --> 1523.44
just

1520.559 --> 1526.0
don't think about logic just look at

1523.44 --> 1528.64
this updated version

1526.0 --> 1531.039
100 years later

1528.64 --> 1533.6000000000001
where we don't need the horizon anymore

1531.039 --> 1536.48
in a direct sense to use it

1533.6 --> 1538.6399999999999
just use that please don't think about

1536.48 --> 1541.039
how it's been used traditionally by

1538.64 --> 1543.76
people all over the world for hundreds

1541.039 --> 1545.039
of years using the horizon and the sun

1543.76 --> 1548.1589999999999
position

1545.039 --> 1549.039
don't think about that

1548.159 --> 1550.4
because

1549.039 --> 1552.0
now

1550.4 --> 1553.1200000000001
we can

1552.0 --> 1555.76
use it

1553.12 --> 1558.0
without the horizon so that fixes

1555.76 --> 1561.36
everything that can make us assert that

1558.0 --> 1561.36
the earth is a globe again

1562.159 --> 1566.0
it's i'm i'm just

1564.08 --> 1568.48
too bored with it

1566.0 --> 1570.799
like i'm not interested anymore

1568.48 --> 1574.64
encountering anti-flat earth nonsense

1570.799 --> 1574.6399999999999
i'm just not interested anymore

1575.36 --> 1578.6789999999999
it's lame

1619.2 --> 1624.8400000000001
do you have covered yet

1621.44 --> 1626.48
probably daniel robles

1624.84 --> 1627.84
probably

1626.48 --> 1630.0
i think i've

1627.84 --> 1631.9189999999999
already had every

1630.0 --> 1634.24
variant

1631.919 --> 1636.7990000000002
i think i typically get the variant like

1634.24 --> 1639.76
before other people do

1636.799 --> 1642.24
just like i get

1639.76 --> 1644.08
weird oracling

1642.24 --> 1647.279
information

1644.08 --> 1650.24
like ahead of time when it's not arrived

1647.279 --> 1654.559
yet with the most majority of people

1650.24 --> 1656.48
i also get sick pretty early

1654.559 --> 1658.799
i do

1656.48 --> 1662.08
it when i get sick

1658.799 --> 1665.76
but i think i probably had all the the

1662.08 --> 1668.1589999999999
covet for ryan's by now

1665.76 --> 1671.52
at one point or another

1668.159 --> 1673.7600000000002
it's just that it's not even like

1671.52 --> 1675.6
doesn't really do anything

1673.76 --> 1678.399
because i'm pretty healthy

1675.6 --> 1681.12
i've been keeping very close track

1678.399 --> 1682.799
my vitamin d3

1681.12 --> 1685.1999999999998
and zinc intake

1682.799 --> 1687.76
and also i've been scoring vitamin c

1685.2 --> 1688.799
constantly so it's just didn't do

1687.76 --> 1690.8799999999999
anything

1688.799 --> 1693.279
yeah i got it and then just

1690.88 --> 1694.3200000000002
recovered like it's not even a basic

1693.279 --> 1697.6
goal

1694.32 --> 1699.76
so i'm done

1697.6 --> 1703.0
i've got all the natural immunity i'll

1699.76 --> 1703.0
ever need

1714.72 --> 1717.039
ah

1718.159 --> 1721.1200000000001
i did last week

1722.84 --> 1728.8799999999999
huh right well it is the season daniel

1726.24 --> 1731.76
robles right everybody

1728.88 --> 1735.0390000000002
typically gets that around

1731.76 --> 1735.039
early january

1735.44 --> 1741.039
or october is always typical typically a

1738.48 --> 1741.039
month for it

1751.44 --> 1757.039
right this like official officially

1754.48 --> 1760.0
registered stats used like

1757.039 --> 1762.8799999999999
charts like okay this is the flu season

1760.0 --> 1765.279
this is like the peak in the year

1762.88 --> 1769.5200000000002
of the few peaks where typically people

1765.279 --> 1769.52
get sick they know when that happens

1770.799 --> 1775.6
and that's always been like that that's

1772.64 --> 1777.2
not like oh then we finally drew out a

1775.6 --> 1781.1999999999998
chart

1777.2 --> 1783.679
after careful study in the last year so

1781.2 --> 1786.0800000000002
no no that's charts they've been using

1783.679 --> 1787.6000000000001
for a hundred years

1786.08 --> 1791.6789999999999
probably

1787.6 --> 1791.6789999999999
yeah it's very well known

1792.799 --> 1796.48
so you don't have to worry about

1794.159 --> 1796.48
anything

1797.12 --> 1804.08
just worry you don't get snared tricked

1800.32 --> 1806.48
into taking some chemical garbage and

1804.08 --> 1808.399
shove it up your nose

1806.48 --> 1810.559
or shove it in your arm

1808.399 --> 1814.52
just be careful not to get tricked into

1810.559 --> 1814.52
that and you'll be fine

1830.96 --> 1833.279
wow

1833.679 --> 1841.44
yeah guns have never that's ridiculous

1837.12 --> 1841.4399999999998
but they're just just destroying it

1843.76 --> 1849.1589999999999
they're literally destroying their own

1846.159 --> 1849.159
systems

1858.08 --> 1862.0
right

1859.279 --> 1866.64
injecting all these

1862.0 --> 1869.039
sports people with yeah with fees

1866.64 --> 1871.1200000000001
and then they literally just drop dead

1869.039 --> 1874.24
on the field during the game

1871.12 --> 1877.039
on a daily [ __ ] basis yeah it's not

1874.24 --> 1880.32
even a rare event it's a daily [ __ ]

1877.039 --> 1882.96
basis totally insane

1880.32 --> 1884.1589999999999
like beyond maniacal that that's

1882.96 --> 1886.96
happening

1884.159 --> 1890.0
like that's literally never

1886.96 --> 1891.6000000000001
ever happened in history nothing even

1890.0 --> 1895.76
close to that

1891.6 --> 1899.1999999999998
in any part of the world ever

1895.76 --> 1900.24
has something that egregious and insane

1899.2 --> 1902.96
happen

1900.24 --> 1904.559
where sportsmen would literally drop

1902.96 --> 1906.3990000000001
dead

1904.559 --> 1910.0
in the middle of a game

1906.399 --> 1914.9599999999998
on a daily basis

1910.0 --> 1918.24
daily it's [ __ ] insane

1914.96 --> 1918.24
it's like even during

1918.48 --> 1922.32
war

1919.679 --> 1924.159
where chemicals are constantly used and

1922.32 --> 1928.0
where it's like full

1924.159 --> 1930.96
blown evil dark warfare with chemical

1928.0 --> 1932.799
war even in such a [ __ ] scenario

1930.96 --> 1935.2
would that never happen something that

1932.799 --> 1938.799
crazy yeah

1935.2 --> 1940.72
it's so insane it's beyond insane the

1938.799 --> 1942.399
people

1940.72 --> 1944.3990000000001
should be

1942.399 --> 1946.8799999999999
literally

1944.399 --> 1949.9189999999999
murdering the ones responsible for this

1946.88 --> 1950.96
like [ __ ] the justice system [ __ ] it all

1949.919 --> 1952.88
target

1950.96 --> 1954.72
pick them out mob

1952.88 --> 1957.7600000000002
go there

1954.72 --> 1959.039
literally just stampede the [ __ ]

1957.76 --> 1961.679
police

1959.039 --> 1962.96
stampeding them like [ __ ] you

1961.679 --> 1964.64
stampede

1962.96 --> 1966.88
get out of the [ __ ] way or get

1964.64 --> 1968.72
crushed under our heels

1966.88 --> 1971.279
get the [ __ ] out

1968.72 --> 1972.88
tear these people out of their little

1971.279 --> 1976.159
fortresses

1972.88 --> 1978.7990000000002
their little palaces overpaid palaces

1976.159 --> 1981.1200000000001
and [ __ ] kill them

1978.799 --> 1982.96
that's what should be happening but no

1981.12 --> 1985.76
people are content

1982.96 --> 1988.32
to just try to imagine like everything's

1985.76 --> 1991.2
normal keep on going watch their

1988.32 --> 1996.24
football game and then see

1991.2 --> 1998.159
how players are literally dropping dead

1996.24 --> 2000.96
almost every game

1998.159 --> 2003.519
yeah they'd rather do that i guess

2000.96 --> 2005.1200000000001
so i guess that you don't deserve to

2003.519 --> 2006.3990000000001
live then

2005.12 --> 2008.08
yeah

2006.399 --> 2011.36
all those people

2008.08 --> 2014.24
that just sit and stare

2011.36 --> 2017.039
you don't deserve to live

2014.24 --> 2018.64
do you understand your weakness

2017.039 --> 2021.44
and insanity

2018.64 --> 2022.6000000000001
of letting this [ __ ] continue

2021.44 --> 2025.919
makes you

2022.6 --> 2029.9189999999999
undeservant to live

2025.919 --> 2032.5590000000002
do you understand the imminent doom

2029.919 --> 2034.88
you summon by your actions and

2032.559 --> 2037.12
especially your inactions

2034.88 --> 2041.0390000000002
imminent doom

2037.12 --> 2041.84
you [ __ ] retards you all deserve to

2041.039 --> 2043.519
be

2041.84 --> 2045.6789999999999
killed

2043.519 --> 2048.24
you deserve to be killed for your

2045.679 --> 2048.2400000000002
weakness

2059.119 --> 2063.28
ah like in kazakhstan the people are

2061.2 --> 2066.0789999999997
taking over

2063.28 --> 2068.079
kazakhstan is complicated

2066.079 --> 2072.2000000000003
i heard it's like a color revolution

2068.079 --> 2072.2000000000003
then russia stepped in

2074.8 --> 2080.159
i'm not even 100 sure what exactly had

2077.52 --> 2080.159
happened there

2081.599 --> 2087.3590000000004
but yeah i'm i think that

2084.48 --> 2088.96
western society

2087.359 --> 2092.3199999999997
should go

2088.96 --> 2095.599
and basically ascend above this social

2092.32 --> 2098.079
contract that has been broken against

2095.599 --> 2100.8
against us we didn't break it it's been

2098.079 --> 2103.92
broken against us and so we should be

2100.8 --> 2105.04
tearing the leaders leaders

2103.92 --> 2107.119
down

2105.04 --> 2109.92
and killing them

2107.119 --> 2113.52
so what do you mean [ __ ] courts

2109.92 --> 2115.44
no we take the leaders that do this and

2113.52 --> 2118.0
then we kill them

2115.44 --> 2121.68
all all of them

2118.0 --> 2124.32
riot mob frenzy we kill him

2121.68 --> 2128.3999999999996
end of the end of it

2124.32 --> 2131.3590000000004
gone no more [ __ ] think tank planners

2128.4 --> 2134.4
no more business schemes

2131.359 --> 2137.359
tear them down and then we kill them

2134.4 --> 2137.359
and it's over

2137.599 --> 2142.0
i don't understand why this is not

2139.52 --> 2145.32
happening on a worldwide scale i really

2142.0 --> 2145.32
don't understand

2157.599 --> 2160.96
right

2158.72 --> 2162.56
and once that's happened once these

2160.96 --> 2165.2
deranged

2162.56 --> 2167.44
psychopathic demons

2165.2 --> 2170.56
been executed

2167.44 --> 2171.68
justly on a spiritual level

2170.56 --> 2173.92
yeah

2171.68 --> 2176.0
what what court system they're part

2173.92 --> 2179.76
they're in the court system right they

2176.0 --> 2181.52
should also be pulled out and executed

2179.76 --> 2183.44
just like that

2181.52 --> 2187.04
all of them

2183.44 --> 2190.079
you all allowed this thing to happen

2187.04 --> 2192.4
and you should die for your contribution

2190.079 --> 2192.4
in that

2192.79 --> 2195.949
[Music]

2197.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
right

2198.32 --> 2204.079
and then after that yeah we can attempt

2201.839 --> 2207.2
to start again and then there's gonna be

2204.079 --> 2209.8390000000004
a really heavy stick mata

2207.2 --> 2211.9199999999996
stigma on yeah anybody that's gonna try

2209.839 --> 2214.0789999999997
to attain a government position or a

2211.92 --> 2217.839
court system position because yeah we

2214.079 --> 2220.32
just had a major surgical intervention

2217.839 --> 2223.2
removing a deadly

2220.32 --> 2224.8
metastasization

2223.2 --> 2226.7999999999997
and everybody's going to be really

2224.8 --> 2229.52
suspicious right i would not be

2226.8 --> 2232.48
surprised and they would not even object

2229.52 --> 2233.7599999999998
if new laws came into play that said

2232.48 --> 2236.32
yeah

2233.76 --> 2238.8
we don't do the death penalty

2236.32 --> 2241.839
under pretty much any circumstances with

2238.8 --> 2242.6400000000003
one exception and that is politicians

2241.839 --> 2244.7999999999997
yeah

2242.64 --> 2245.7599999999998
death penalty for politicians need to

2244.8 --> 2250.5600000000004
return

2245.76 --> 2250.5600000000004
like universally universally

2252.72 --> 2256.3999999999996
because they will

2254.8 --> 2259.2000000000003
again

2256.4 --> 2261.76
be psychopaths getting in that position

2259.2 --> 2265.839
using their immunity and then [ __ ]

2261.76 --> 2270.92
everything up and then walk away clean

2265.839 --> 2270.92
unless they get the death penalty

2271.28 --> 2275.8390000000004
and then it's not going to be so easy

2272.96 --> 2275.839
anymore now is it

2281.839 --> 2285.52
right

2283.52 --> 2288.48
yeah well let's see what happens

2285.52 --> 2290.8
i don't know stasmaret's putin wants to

2288.48 --> 2293.04
see the world burn i have no idea i

2290.8 --> 2297.48
don't think so really

2293.04 --> 2297.48
i think he just mainly wants to

2300.32 --> 2304.6400000000003
save his own country

2302.56 --> 2309.119
i think that's his primary objective i

2304.64 --> 2309.1189999999997
think that's already kind of a big task

2309.359 --> 2313.839
in the face of everything that's

2310.88 --> 2313.839
happening

2314.16 --> 2319.68
but yeah putin is not a world president

2317.44 --> 2322.64
he's not there to save the world he's

2319.68 --> 2325.44
there to keep the world stable so that

2322.64 --> 2327.2
his country will do well

2325.44 --> 2329.92
that's what he's doing

2327.2 --> 2331.839
he's doing it for his nation not for the

2329.92 --> 2334.0
world if the world burns it's none of

2331.839 --> 2337.2
his concern unless it's going to

2334.0 --> 2338.16
indirectly influence his country

2337.2 --> 2339.839
so

2338.16 --> 2340.7999999999997
no he does not want to see the world

2339.839 --> 2343.839
burn

2340.8 --> 2347.04
but i think putin too would like

2343.839 --> 2349.44
certain places to burn

2347.04 --> 2352.24
in order to potentially trigger a

2349.44 --> 2355.68
wake-up call like hey maybe you should

2352.24 --> 2357.52
[ __ ] do something about this insanity

2355.68 --> 2360.3999999999996
right that's probably

2357.52 --> 2361.28
why he would let certain things burn

2360.4 --> 2362.96
because

2361.28 --> 2363.92
yeah people

2362.96 --> 2365.2
you know

2363.92 --> 2366.32
need to

2365.2 --> 2368.3199999999997
actually

2366.32 --> 2372.96
step out of their trance and do

2368.32 --> 2372.96
something only politicians yeah

2375.28 --> 2378.7200000000003
yes only politicians

2380.079 --> 2383.76
that's right that was a carefully

2382.4 --> 2386.56
thought through

2383.76 --> 2389.119
idea steamy traveler only politicians

2386.56 --> 2389.119
that's right

2393.839 --> 2399.92
no stats moretz that's [ __ ]

2397.2 --> 2404.24
he does not want soviet states that is

2399.92 --> 2404.2400000000002
literally [ __ ] you're an idiot

2407.359 --> 2410.88
i'm inclined to take your wrench away

2409.119 --> 2413.52
because it's really stupid to say

2410.88 --> 2416.1600000000003
something like that it really is it's

2413.52 --> 2420.16
really stupid

2416.16 --> 2422.64
he's not soft yet he's not a communist

2420.16 --> 2422.64
at all

2423.44 --> 2428.8
is pretty much

2426.079 --> 2430.7200000000003
in yeah opposition of everything

2428.8 --> 2433.04
associated with that

2430.72 --> 2436.0
he's lift through it and that's why he

2433.04 --> 2438.079
knows it's it's crap

2436.0 --> 2441.2
it's not good it's not good for his

2438.079 --> 2441.2000000000003
country he knows that

2442.0 --> 2446.64
can you elaborate

2443.92 --> 2446.64
i just did

2449.839 --> 2452.4
oh yeah

2450.839 --> 2454.56
mh33

2452.4 --> 2456.48
whatever does that yeah that's not

2454.56 --> 2458.24
dude

2456.48 --> 2460.72
can't be serious

2458.24 --> 2463.2
like that was freaking ukraine

2460.72 --> 2466.319
i don't give a [ __ ] what anything or

2463.2 --> 2468.7999999999997
anybody says that was ukraine there's

2466.319 --> 2471.119
nothing that could convince me otherwise

2468.8 --> 2472.96
there's no reason for russia to ever do

2471.119 --> 2475.2000000000003
something like that

2472.96 --> 2477.119
on purpose

2475.2 --> 2478.56
and i don't think they would do it by

2477.119 --> 2481.04
accident

2478.56 --> 2484.24
ukraine however oh yeah they'll [ __ ]

2481.04 --> 2485.44
around they ukraine is like a wasp's

2484.24 --> 2488.24
nest

2485.44 --> 2490.56
they like to [ __ ] things

2488.24 --> 2493.2
screw it over create confusion and

2490.56 --> 2495.2799999999997
agitation because they use that

2493.2 --> 2499.1189999999997
in their in their mechanisms in their

2495.28 --> 2502.5600000000004
machinations they use that they create

2499.119 --> 2502.56
havoc on purpose

2506.48 --> 2511.2
and that's yeah as far as i'm willing to

2508.4 --> 2511.2000000000003
go about that

2515.839 --> 2519.2
should not remove i'm not talking about

2517.76 --> 2523.2000000000003
removing

2519.2 --> 2527.2
steamy traveler look i'm referring to my

2523.2 --> 2527.2
own country when i'm talking about that

2531.359 --> 2535.2
yeah and by the way like what you

2533.599 --> 2538.079
described there

2535.2 --> 2540.48
i don't even think that should be

2538.079 --> 2542.5600000000004
like off the court system that should

2540.48 --> 2544.56
just the people should just [ __ ] kill

2542.56 --> 2547.359
them

2544.56 --> 2550.4
right so why would you need to

2547.359 --> 2552.4
have somebody get the death penalty when

2550.4 --> 2555.92
you can pretty much guarantee they're

2552.4 --> 2558.0
going to just be killed in jail

2555.92 --> 2560.079
you know

2558.0 --> 2564.079
no but what i'm talking about for

2560.079 --> 2567.92
politicians specifically is to make a

2564.079 --> 2569.6800000000003
like an inescapable example

2567.92 --> 2571.599
right

2569.68 --> 2574.64
to have a direct

2571.599 --> 2577.76
direct consequence to offset

2574.64 --> 2579.52
their psychological

2577.76 --> 2582.5600000000004
trickery

2579.52 --> 2585.2
so i'm not telling like oh we should

2582.56 --> 2588.16
to get rid of the death penalty if you

2585.2 --> 2590.7999999999997
haven't or i'm not talking about that

2588.16 --> 2593.52
i'm not talking about a detailed

2590.8 --> 2595.76
refinement of how we should have justice

2593.52 --> 2598.72
in the court systems worldwide i wasn't

2595.76 --> 2598.7200000000003
talking about that

2599.2 --> 2602.24
she's referring mostly to the

2600.64 --> 2603.2799999999997
netherlands where there is no more death

2602.24 --> 2604.839
penalty

2603.28 --> 2607.92
in other countries

2604.839 --> 2610.64
around which have the same

2607.92 --> 2612.88
and then say okay just yeah

2610.64 --> 2615.1189999999997
okay that's that's cool it's very modern

2612.88 --> 2617.6800000000003
of us now one exception though and

2615.119 --> 2618.839
that's for politicians

2617.68 --> 2622.48
that's

2618.839 --> 2625.2799999999997
for government functionaries

2622.48 --> 2627.44
they should absolutely

2625.28 --> 2629.119
have the risk of getting the death

2627.44 --> 2630.4
penalty if they overstep their

2629.119 --> 2632.2400000000002
boundaries

2630.4 --> 2635.2400000000002
to a certain degree they should

2632.24 --> 2635.24
absolutely

2636.72 --> 2639.04
right

2640.96 --> 2644.96
with like no time limit on it

2643.44 --> 2647.76
so if it turns out that they were

2644.96 --> 2650.2400000000002
secretly doing [ __ ]

2647.76 --> 2653.3590000000004
that 10 years later they will still just

2650.24 --> 2654.4799999999996
legally get the death penalty for it

2653.359 --> 2655.839
right

2654.48 --> 2656.88
because

2655.839 --> 2659.04
yeah

2656.88 --> 2660.48
just people that do that just need to

2659.04 --> 2662.72
die

2660.48 --> 2664.88
they just need to die and be removed

2662.72 --> 2665.7599999999998
from the world even afterward does it

2664.88 --> 2669.52
matter

2665.76 --> 2672.6400000000003
like people that do that need to die

2669.52 --> 2672.64
everybody hates them

2673.52 --> 2677.839
like they even hate themselves but

2675.599 --> 2677.839
anyway

2684.88 --> 2688.4
yeah george sanford it's not the same

2687.04 --> 2691.359
though because

2688.4 --> 2693.92
putin specifically is used they're using

2691.359 --> 2695.119
their own jab system they're using the

2693.92 --> 2697.2000000000003
sputnik

2695.119 --> 2698.6400000000003
and they're not even public about the

2697.2 --> 2701.52
ingredients

2698.64 --> 2705.04
george sanford so it's not the same it's

2701.52 --> 2707.28
still very [ __ ] annoying though

2705.04 --> 2707.2799999999997
right

2707.92 --> 2711.04
like putin's basically engaged with the

2710.16 --> 2712.48
same

2711.04 --> 2713.92
weakness

2712.48 --> 2716.079
almost the same

2713.92 --> 2719.599
as what trump did when he just kept

2716.079 --> 2723.119
promoting it garbage

2719.599 --> 2723.119
but putin has his own

2723.359 --> 2728.48
own types of jabs we don't know what's

2726.4 --> 2730.4
in them they could

2728.48 --> 2734.0
literally be

2730.4 --> 2736.4
all saline i've never even heard of like

2734.0 --> 2738.72
side effects of the sputnik vaccine i've

2736.4 --> 2741.92
never even heard of it

2738.72 --> 2741.9199999999996
you don't know what it is

2742.0 --> 2747.2
we don't know what it is it's not public

2744.48 --> 2750.16
what it is

2747.2 --> 2753.5989999999997
what's in there it's not public

2750.16 --> 2753.5989999999997
so you can't compare it

2758.64 --> 2764.0
four different jobs what are you talking

2760.64 --> 2764.0
about in russia

2770.64 --> 2777.04
well that would really suck

2774.48 --> 2778.88
right well yeah in that case putin's

2777.04 --> 2783.04
taking the same package

2778.88 --> 2783.04
as trump that means he is two

2783.119 --> 2786.839
going towards the end

2784.88 --> 2790.4
it's over then

2786.839 --> 2793.119
right all the legend that trump had of

2790.4 --> 2796.1600000000003
how he's gonna save it and save populism

2793.119 --> 2798.079
and save nationalism and

2796.16 --> 2801.04
yeah that's over

2798.079 --> 2804.2400000000002
it's very over well i guess putin is

2801.04 --> 2804.24
yeah it's over with him too

2805.92 --> 2809.119
if he's really doing that

2809.92 --> 2814.4
but i don't know if he's really

2812.079 --> 2817.8390000000004
going that far

2814.4 --> 2818.88
i don't know if like all these

2817.839 --> 2820.56
like

2818.88 --> 2823.359
american

2820.56 --> 2826.72
pharmaceutical company brand

2823.359 --> 2830.839
vaccines are like approved in russia i

2826.72 --> 2830.839
don't know that george sanford

2831.839 --> 2838.0789999999997
i don't see why that would be done

2834.56 --> 2838.0789999999997
why that would even be allowed

2838.24 --> 2844.04
what what's like in his interest i

2840.559 --> 2844.0400000000004
didn't see it

2851.21 --> 2854.329
[Music]

2854.72 --> 2859.2799999999997
all right yeah psych bear

2856.48 --> 2862.0
yeah i agree yeah if you're thinking

2859.28 --> 2864.96
about revenge and

2862.0 --> 2867.28
and killing and maiming yeah that's not

2864.96 --> 2870.8
good for you

2867.28 --> 2875.599
i'm kind of like at the point where i'm

2870.8 --> 2875.599
very much losing my care for that

2877.04 --> 2883.2
because i size it up i think it would be

2880.0 --> 2886.319
more painful for me to sit like through

2883.2 --> 2889.04
20 years of having to observe

2886.319 --> 2891.359
entire societies mentally degenerating

2889.04 --> 2894.72
committing suicide being

2891.359 --> 2896.64
medically mutilated and

2894.72 --> 2899.1189999999997
living

2896.64 --> 2902.319
torturous remainders of their life

2899.119 --> 2903.599
torturous like everyday torture

2902.319 --> 2905.68
because of that

2903.599 --> 2907.839
for like a prolonged time

2905.68 --> 2910.7999999999997
i think it would be more torturous to do

2907.839 --> 2913.359
nothing and witness as everything around

2910.8 --> 2915.76
you is being tortured to death slowly

2913.359 --> 2918.64
and completely mentally degenerating

2915.76 --> 2920.1600000000003
every cohesion of spirit being lost

2918.64 --> 2922.5589999999997
around you

2920.16 --> 2923.839
well i'd rather be part of a

2922.559 --> 2925.92
murderous

2923.839 --> 2928.72
frenzying mob

2925.92 --> 2932.079
and literally having blood on my hands

2928.72 --> 2935.1189999999997
and maybe even wounding the wrong person

2932.079 --> 2936.319
i'd rather have that on my conscience

2935.119 --> 2938.48
i mean it

2936.319 --> 2943.64
i really do

2938.48 --> 2943.64
i really really mean that

2955.839 --> 2958.839
so

2972.559 --> 2974.8
right

2979.119 --> 2983.2000000000003
so yeah psycbear it's it's up to

2981.52 --> 2985.359
everybody right

2983.2 --> 2987.2
if i'd had a

2985.359 --> 2988.72
family for myself and it was

2987.2 --> 2991.04
homesteading yeah i wouldn't even

2988.72 --> 2995.1189999999997
consider going there

2991.04 --> 2996.88
i don't though i'm solitary here

2995.119 --> 2998.88
so

2996.88 --> 3001.359
i don't have anything to hold me back

2998.88 --> 3001.359
from that

3004.64 --> 3009.2799999999997
so i'm like okay well i'll just

3007.28 --> 3011.76
i'll just be

3009.28 --> 3014.7200000000003
the one to do it then i'll just do it

3011.76 --> 3019.44
then i don't have to

3014.72 --> 3021.7599999999998
stay alive to teach my kids or anything

3019.44 --> 3024.48
or to set the right example prevent them

3021.76 --> 3027.5200000000004
from i don't know getting lost

3024.48 --> 3030.96
as well in the frenzy so i'm like yeah

3027.52 --> 3033.28
i'm i'm already lost i'm already done i

3030.96 --> 3036.57
just send me in i'll do it i'll [ __ ]

3033.28 --> 3038.1600000000003
do it i'll kill them i'll do it

3036.57 --> 3041.839
[Music]

3038.16 --> 3041.839
because it doesn't matter anymore

3042.319 --> 3046.4
it just has to end one way or the other

3044.24 --> 3048.9599999999996
it just has to end and i don't want to

3046.4 --> 3052.2400000000002
sit through the rest of my life seeing

3048.96 --> 3053.16
as the public the general public

3052.24 --> 3054.9599999999996
is

3053.16 --> 3059.2799999999997
degenerating and

3054.96 --> 3061.44
mentally and medically tortured to death

3059.28 --> 3064.1600000000003
with me just watching not being able to

3061.44 --> 3066.319
do anything about it yeah

3064.16 --> 3070.0
the idea of that

3066.319 --> 3071.68
well i'd rather be a murderer that just

3070.0 --> 3074.0
kills

3071.68 --> 3076.48
some politician or whatever i'd rather

3074.0 --> 3076.48
be that

3077.28 --> 3080.8390000000004
i don't want to

3078.559 --> 3083.2000000000003
i don't want to go through that

3080.839 --> 3085.7599999999998
slow torturous

3083.2 --> 3088.3999999999996
voyeur cycle i don't want to see it i

3085.76 --> 3090.559
don't want to spend 20 years watching

3088.4 --> 3091.839
everybody around me

3090.559 --> 3094.2400000000002
slowly

3091.839 --> 3096.7999999999997
being medically and mentally tortured to

3094.24 --> 3098.7999999999997
that i don't want to do that i'd rather

3096.8 --> 3101.8
be a murderer

3098.8 --> 3101.8
absolutely

3114.24 --> 3118.16
yeah psych bear well that's one way to

3116.319 --> 3120.48
regard it

3118.16 --> 3122.96
and i'm staring at it i've been staring

3120.48 --> 3126.319
at it for years

3122.96 --> 3128.88
82 remember episode 82

3126.319 --> 3131.839
that's it's all the same thing guys it's

3128.88 --> 3133.52
all the same vision i had

3131.839 --> 3135.2799999999997
it's the maximum

3133.52 --> 3137.2
punishment

3135.28 --> 3139.28
possible

3137.2 --> 3141.5989999999997
and they're invoking it because

3139.28 --> 3143.2000000000003
the people out there that are in control

3141.599 --> 3145.04
doing this

3143.2 --> 3147.04
that are possessed

3145.04 --> 3150.0
very much possessed

3147.04 --> 3153.359
by considerably the devil

3150.0 --> 3157.2
because it is kind of a unified spirit

3153.359 --> 3160.7999999999997
whatever that is it's unified

3157.2 --> 3162.7999999999997
and it that spirit what it wants

3160.8 --> 3164.88
the only thing it really wants is

3162.8 --> 3167.44
eternal silence

3164.88 --> 3170.1600000000003
and the only way to achieve eternal

3167.44 --> 3172.319
silence is for all

3170.16 --> 3175.2799999999997
life in the realm

3172.319 --> 3176.16
to be extinguished forever

3175.28 --> 3179.119
right

3176.16 --> 3180.8799999999997
so it craves for destruction well what

3179.119 --> 3183.359
can it destroy

3180.88 --> 3186.96
the things that allow it in

3183.359 --> 3190.88
yeah the devil wants to be destroyed

3186.96 --> 3193.92
they want to be executed not for some

3190.88 --> 3196.6400000000003
counterplan oh no we can't do it or it's

3193.92 --> 3197.599
a trap no they literally want to be

3196.64 --> 3200.48
killed

3197.599 --> 3203.2000000000003
do you understand they want to be

3200.48 --> 3203.2
slaughtered

3203.599 --> 3207.599
they want to feel

3205.68 --> 3211.44
that burning

3207.599 --> 3212.88
justice through creation one last time

3211.44 --> 3215.52
before they go

3212.88 --> 3218.88
that's what they really want inside they

3215.52 --> 3222.48
want us to do it not as a trap but

3218.88 --> 3226.04
because they want to die and we must

3222.48 --> 3226.04
give it to them

3235.5 --> 3238.63
[Music]

3243.04 --> 3246.24
okay

3243.92 --> 3246.2400000000002
let's

3247.119 --> 3250.92
wind it back down

3257.44 --> 3262.64
yeah

3259.28 --> 3264.7200000000003
i can get a little frustrated sometimes

3262.64 --> 3266.24
but yeah everything i said is it not

3264.72 --> 3269.2
made up

3266.24 --> 3271.839
it's true they want to die they want to

3269.2 --> 3271.839
be killed

3272.319 --> 3279.839
because in the end the only thing the

3274.88 --> 3279.839
devil wants is for it all to end

3280.96 --> 3286.16
so that there's nothing

3282.799 --> 3288.16
its spirit can touch anymore so it will

3286.16 --> 3291.2
finally have eternal silence because

3288.16 --> 3291.2
there's no more sin

3291.359 --> 3294.319
but until

3292.559 --> 3297.119
that time

3294.319 --> 3299.119
the ones that use him that allow

3297.119 --> 3303.2000000000003
themselves to be possessed by him they

3299.119 --> 3303.2000000000003
sin and they will spread more sin

3303.28 --> 3307.2000000000003
it's like

3304.48 --> 3310.64
the absolute possessed satanists are

3307.2 --> 3310.64
satan's worst enemies

3310.799 --> 3313.28
because

3311.839 --> 3315.2799999999997
they just

3313.28 --> 3316.559
create more

3315.28 --> 3319.28
issues

3316.559 --> 3321.52
the devil has to deal with

3319.28 --> 3323.52
it's just gonna take longer right the

3321.52 --> 3326.4
only reason

3323.52 --> 3328.96
even remotely why it works

3326.4 --> 3331.6800000000003
is because of the outlook that maybe

3328.96 --> 3333.52
satan could through them destroy all

3331.68 --> 3336.3999999999996
life

3333.52 --> 3336.4
at some point

3338.319 --> 3341.839
right because otherwise

3340.319 --> 3343.839
doesn't do that

3341.839 --> 3347.119
it was always going to automatically

3343.839 --> 3349.119
return there will always be newcomers

3347.119 --> 3350.799
completely unconnected completely

3349.119 --> 3354.88
untaught

3350.799 --> 3357.119
that will touch satan again

3354.88 --> 3358.6400000000003
by their own choice nobody telling them

3357.119 --> 3359.92
to

3358.64 --> 3361.52
in the future it's always going to

3359.92 --> 3362.4
happen again

3361.52 --> 3364.72
right

3362.4 --> 3367.28
the only way to stop that from going

3364.72 --> 3368.24
forever until the end of time within the

3367.28 --> 3372.48
realm

3368.24 --> 3372.4799999999996
is to literally destroy all life

3372.799 --> 3380.559
so yeah in in the foundation

3376.079 --> 3384.2400000000002
satan's worst enemies are the satanists

3380.559 --> 3384.2400000000002
because they just won't let it go

3384.799 --> 3388.44
think about it carefully

3397.04 --> 3403.48
not gonna kill anyone anytime okay

3399.119 --> 3403.48
service day that's fine i

3404.24 --> 3410.5589999999997
i'm not being super literal either

3408.0 --> 3412.96
like i don't see myself like

3410.559 --> 3414.799
i probably couldn't do it

3412.96 --> 3417.76
at this point

3414.799 --> 3420.559
but i could sure as hell feed the spirit

3417.76 --> 3420.559
that wanted to

3421.04 --> 3426.96
and i could sure as well help people

3424.88 --> 3431.319
justify doing it

3426.96 --> 3431.319
i sure as hell can do that

3433.76 --> 3439.5200000000004
because yeah it's never going to be fun

3437.92 --> 3441.44
it's always going to be miserable it's

3439.52 --> 3444.839
always going to leave some misery and

3441.44 --> 3444.839
pain afterwards

3451.28 --> 3458.8390000000004
right but yeah that's not an excuse for

3454.319 --> 3458.839
not doing what needs to be done

3465.839 --> 3470.4
granddaddy of human clone you know

3467.68 --> 3471.839
cloning is completely useless

3470.4 --> 3476.48
it is

3471.839 --> 3476.48
cloning is useless it doesn't work

3477.359 --> 3480.72
every clone

3478.799 --> 3483.359
is going to have a shorter life cycle

3480.72 --> 3484.64
and there is no amount of technological

3483.359 --> 3487.44
perfection

3484.64 --> 3490.0
that can actually negate that element

3487.44 --> 3492.7200000000003
there's no nothing that can be done

3490.0 --> 3494.88
so cloning is never going to actually

3492.72 --> 3497.68
provide immortality ever

3494.88 --> 3499.6800000000003
ever it's never going to work ever

3497.68 --> 3503.2799999999997
it is not within the range of

3499.68 --> 3506.68
possibility within creation

3503.28 --> 3506.6800000000003
doesn't work

3538.72 --> 3542.04
right anyway

3545.68 --> 3550.5589999999997
maybe we could cut into another subject

3555.599 --> 3561.28
huh oh mitchell from australia just

3557.839 --> 3563.68

3726.64 --> 3730.8799999999997
that guy is a total

3729.52 --> 3734.88
psychopath

3730.88 --> 3737.28
like a really [ __ ] up one one that

3734.88 --> 3738.319
should be put into a mental institution

3737.28 --> 3742.88
and then

3738.319 --> 3742.88
not allowed on the internet ever again

3744.4 --> 3750.96
it was all him he literally acted like

3748.0 --> 3754.799
he was his own son

3750.96 --> 3757.52
the guy's a [ __ ] insane person

3754.799 --> 3759.599
and he did his shitty thing

3757.52 --> 3762.88
again

3759.599 --> 3764.2400000000002
again false promises again he literally

3762.88 --> 3766.4
wanted me

3764.24 --> 3769.4399999999996
to basically

3766.4 --> 3773.28
report to me how how i've been

3769.44 --> 3775.68
influenced by mk ultra and like dude

3773.28 --> 3778.0
i i'd like i just want to stab through

3775.68 --> 3779.2
his throat i just want him to shut the

3778.0 --> 3782.0
[ __ ] up

3779.2 --> 3785.0389999999998
with his insane rambling he literally

3782.0 --> 3787.92
doesn't know anything about it

3785.039 --> 3790.48
anything he does not understand anything

3787.92 --> 3790.48
about me

3792.0 --> 3797.039
so i had this skype call with him

3795.119 --> 3799.76
and then when i figured out he wasn't

3797.039 --> 3803.599
actually going to pay me he would just

3799.76 --> 3806.7990000000004
wanted me to surrender to him in slavery

3803.599 --> 3810.96
in mental slavery the guy wants me to be

3806.799 --> 3813.2
his absolute unconditional mental slave

3810.96 --> 3816.559
he doesn't even say it but that's what

3813.2 --> 3819.359
he wants he wants me to basically tell

3816.559 --> 3822.88
him whatever he asks for

3819.359 --> 3825.52
no matter if it makes no sense

3822.88 --> 3827.76
and he's never going to give me anything

3825.52 --> 3832.079
ever

3827.76 --> 3832.079
he just wants to drive me insane

3834.96 --> 3839.039
you he actually said

3837.839 --> 3841.44
like

3839.039 --> 3844.559
i don't even i can't even go there it's

3841.44 --> 3844.559
so repulsive

3844.88 --> 3850.559
he basically wanted me to report in to

3847.68 --> 3852.48
the government as a victim

3850.559 --> 3855.92
of mk ultra

3852.48 --> 3857.599
for financial benefits

3855.92 --> 3861.76
yeah

3857.599 --> 3861.76
that was his [ __ ] genius plan

3864.839 --> 3868.92
i uh

3891.839 --> 3897.839
yeah so if you see an icon in chat

3895.68 --> 3900.0789999999997
with that [ __ ] up

3897.839 --> 3903.0389999999998
little kid

3900.079 --> 3908.28
with a hoodie on seeing

3903.039 --> 3908.28
creepy dude that guy is in a

3908.319 --> 3914.48
i bet money that that guy is actually a

3911.119 --> 3917.76
a pedo ring organizer or something i bet

3914.48 --> 3920.64
he he must be that [ __ ] up

3917.76 --> 3923.599
i bet he is i bet he actually deals with

3920.64 --> 3928.319
that [ __ ]

3923.599 --> 3928.319
i i bet he is actually one of those guys

3928.559 --> 3934.079
so creepy i

3930.96 --> 3937.2
i cannot

3934.079 --> 3938.079
overestimate how [ __ ] creepy that guy

3937.2 --> 3940.3999999999996
is

3938.079 --> 3942.6400000000003
he's one of the most creepy people i've

3940.4 --> 3945.839
ever bumped into on the internet

3942.64 --> 3947.2
and he sends me these giant insane

3945.839 --> 3950.64
emails

3947.2 --> 3953.0389999999998
on top of that

3950.64 --> 3953.0389999999998
god

3962.799 --> 3966.079
i already showed you one of these emails

3964.559 --> 3969.92
one time right well

3966.079 --> 3972.0
guess what he sends me one periodically

3969.92 --> 3974.16
yesterday sent me three

3972.0 --> 3978.559
three giant pages

3974.16 --> 3982.5589999999997
with crazy psychopath letter

3978.559 --> 3984.88
changed font sizes and crazy the guy's a

3982.559 --> 3987.119
[ __ ] insane person he needs to be

3984.88 --> 3989.599
locked up and cut off from the internet

3987.119 --> 3989.599
forever

3990.079 --> 3993.079
god

3998.64 --> 4002.44
oh flatter sage

4022.24 --> 4027.68
right oh yeah by the way psych bear

4025.28 --> 4029.44
good comment don't get me wrong at times

4027.68 --> 4030.96
it's extremely hard not to have violent

4029.44 --> 4033.039
thoughts towards these possessed people

4030.96 --> 4034.48
that are blatantly trying to destroy us

4033.039 --> 4038.1600000000003
right well it's not even about the

4034.48 --> 4041.2
thoughts it's about the action

4038.16 --> 4043.7599999999998
that's what i'm about like i don't even

4041.2 --> 4045.0389999999998
actively think about that

4043.76 --> 4047.8390000000004
i just

4045.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
want the action i just want it to be

4047.839 --> 4052.0789999999997
ended

4049.839 --> 4055.0389999999998
and i know that on the inside the

4052.079 --> 4057.039
possessed as you designate them they

4055.039 --> 4058.559
want it too they just want to be

4057.039 --> 4061.76
murdered

4058.559 --> 4065.44
they just want to be murdered for the

4061.76 --> 4067.5200000000004
doubling down on injustice and vile evil

4065.44 --> 4068.7200000000003
that they've dedicated their lives to

4067.52 --> 4071.7599999999998
that's what they want that's their

4068.72 --> 4074.24
reward being murdered

4071.76 --> 4076.559
is their reward

4074.24 --> 4077.9199999999996
sounds crazy right

4076.559 --> 4079.039
yeah

4077.92 --> 4080.319
it is

4079.039 --> 4083.3590000000004
they are

4080.319 --> 4083.359
and that's what it is

4083.44 --> 4086.7200000000003
so

4084.72 --> 4089.68
i just want to give them their just

4086.72 --> 4091.2799999999997
reward that's all

4089.68 --> 4094.3999999999996
i just want to

4091.28 --> 4094.4
help them end it

4094.559 --> 4100.319
and their madness

4097.279 --> 4101.679
that's it that's all

4100.319 --> 4105.359
anyway

4101.679 --> 4107.52
moving off of that from that

4105.359 --> 4109.279
always wally these days

4107.52 --> 4113.719
i don't know i think wally's still

4109.279 --> 4113.719
hanging around in discord and all that

4130.96 --> 4133.839
okay

4154.799 --> 4159.239
what should i call today's show

4160.159 --> 4163.199
kind of a harsh show

4166.159 --> 4169.159
um

4186.48 --> 4189.48
uh

4207.84 --> 4212.8
all right yeah i talked about the

4209.28 --> 4217.28
welfare system issues

4212.8 --> 4221.320000000001
dark traps of the welfare system

4217.28 --> 4221.32
i'm going to assemble a title

4257.84 --> 4259.92
you

4265.71 --> 4269.26
[Applause]

4276.77 --> 4279.829000000001
[Music]

4285.84 --> 4291.12
yeah it's a bit of a long title when i

4288.239 --> 4293.599999999999
can do it welfare dilapidation and the

4291.12 --> 4295.76
devil possessed secretly want to meet

4293.6 --> 4299.159000000001
justice

4295.76 --> 4299.159000000001
i like that

4308.88 --> 4313.400000000001
that's a very long title though

4345.44 --> 4348.4
there's no rest for the wicked only

4346.8 --> 4350.88
death can ring them

4348.4 --> 4352.4
bring it to them blessed truly ask

4350.88 --> 4355.679
forgiveness and turn away from their

4352.4 --> 4357.759999999999
evil ways yeah but they don't

4355.679 --> 4359.76
you see psych bear

4357.76 --> 4361.679
after some point when you've doubled

4359.76 --> 4365.6
down on evil

4361.679 --> 4368.08
so many times to make it to make a point

4365.6 --> 4369.84
at the time to virtue signal to other

4368.08 --> 4372.08
evil

4369.84 --> 4375.1990000000005
there is no way back

4372.08 --> 4377.679
after you've done certain things

4375.199 --> 4379.919999999999
the sheer amount of punishment

4377.679 --> 4382.2390000000005
to actually try to be on the other side

4379.92 --> 4382.2390000000005
again

4382.88 --> 4389.1990000000005
it's it could never be worth it

4386.96 --> 4390.32
unless you're literally

4389.199 --> 4392.879999999999
ready to

4390.32 --> 4396.88
basically live the rest of your life

4392.88 --> 4399.6
like a prisoner in a dungeon

4396.88 --> 4401.04
that's never going to get respect from

4399.6 --> 4402.8
anybody

4401.04 --> 4405.28
it's always going to be scoffed at that

4402.8 --> 4407.6
doesn't have any power that doesn't even

4405.28 --> 4411.28
have any of their old skills

4407.6 --> 4415.280000000001
because the more you double down on evil

4411.28 --> 4418.0
the less you actually get back

4415.28 --> 4420.719
when you step away from evil

4418.0 --> 4423.6
i know this from experience thank god i

4420.719 --> 4425.44
never went so far with it

4423.6 --> 4428.08
but i know at some point if you go

4425.44 --> 4429.759999999999
certain over certain lines

4428.08 --> 4432.159
it's not even about the actions it's

4429.76 --> 4433.76
about how your mind deals with what

4432.159 --> 4436.799999999999
happens

4433.76 --> 4438.320000000001
if you go too far

4436.8 --> 4440.320000000001
you

4438.32 --> 4443.04
the only thing that happens when you

4440.32 --> 4445.679
step away is you lose everything your

4443.04 --> 4448.159
skills your faculties

4445.679 --> 4452.56
your power you just lose everything and

4448.159 --> 4452.5599999999995
you don't get anything back ever again

4452.88 --> 4456.56
or that well not ever again

4455.36 --> 4459.12
but

4456.56 --> 4460.88
you might get like a consolidation prize

4459.12 --> 4461.599999999999
at some point

4460.88 --> 4464.32
but

4461.6 --> 4466.08
it's going to be nothing like what you

4464.32 --> 4467.679
were in the first place

4466.08 --> 4471.5199999999995
right

4467.679 --> 4474.719
so there's oh there's only so far

4471.52 --> 4476.96
you can dive into the darkness

4474.719 --> 4479.92
before there's literally no more way

4476.96 --> 4482.719
back and then the only end and

4479.92 --> 4485.28
the only way out is death

4482.719 --> 4488.4800000000005
that's the only thing

4485.28 --> 4488.48
that will make it stop

4490.56 --> 4497.360000000001
once you go over certain borders only

4492.8 --> 4500.320000000001
death can save you now

4497.36 --> 4503.639999999999
sounds dramatic right it's true

4500.32 --> 4503.639999999999
it's true

4514.8 --> 4519.360000000001
bob's a [ __ ]

4516.48 --> 4521.839999999999
i didn't even talk about bob

4519.36 --> 4523.92
and i'm not gonna put kill them all in a

4521.84 --> 4526.2390000000005
freaking title i'm not a i'm not an

4523.92 --> 4526.2390000000005
idiot

4531.73 --> 4535.969999999999
[Music]

4533.6 --> 4539.089
but anyways thanks for trying

4535.97 --> 4539.089
[Music]

4548.719 --> 4555.28
they've seen the documents

4552.56 --> 4556.8
that flat earth is a psyop okay so all

4555.28 --> 4559.44
right all right

4556.8 --> 4563.4400000000005
so it's a psyop is it

4559.44 --> 4564.48
so how about the technical arguments

4563.44 --> 4567.759999999999
right

4564.48 --> 4570.08
i mean could the truth

4567.76 --> 4572.8
be a psyop

4570.08 --> 4574.64
in a world of lies

4572.8 --> 4576.719
i think it could

4574.64 --> 4580.4800000000005
if the world is already completely

4576.719 --> 4583.679
immersed in lies of a certain type well

4580.48 --> 4585.04
the truth would be a revolutionary act

4583.679 --> 4588.32
so what if

4585.04 --> 4588.32
secret surface then

4589.199 --> 4593.599999999999
tried to secretly introduce the secret

4592.48 --> 4596.0
truth

4593.6 --> 4599.120000000001
as a controlled opposition

4596.0 --> 4602.08
project to take control of anybody that

4599.12 --> 4604.96
would have the faculties and the will

4602.08 --> 4606.239
to actually oppose the whole thing

4604.96 --> 4610.56
yeah

4606.239 --> 4612.239
of course there would have to be a psyop

4610.56 --> 4613.84
of flat earth

4612.239 --> 4616.0
because

4613.84 --> 4618.8
they would be crazy not to create a

4616.0 --> 4620.8
psyop of flat earth they would be crazy

4618.8 --> 4623.12
not to try

4620.8 --> 4625.6
not to try and take control over that

4623.12 --> 4627.92
development process

4625.6 --> 4630.320000000001
it would be crazy not to so of course

4627.92 --> 4632.8
they're going to do that of course

4630.32 --> 4634.159
since flat earth was going to come out

4632.8 --> 4635.76
eventually

4634.159 --> 4638.239
inevitably

4635.76 --> 4640.96
because of the internet revolution is

4638.239 --> 4643.36
because of communication revolution

4640.96 --> 4644.64
then of course they would

4643.36 --> 4650.08
try to

4644.64 --> 4653.679
spearhead some of that in order to

4650.08 --> 4655.76
identify the talents

4653.679 --> 4658.8
steer them a little

4655.76 --> 4662.08
make them try to conform the certain a

4658.8 --> 4665.679
pre-written plan with traps and all to

4662.08 --> 4667.84
my to help them to avoid figuring out

4665.679 --> 4670.4
those traps about it right

4667.84 --> 4672.159000000001
like oh the earth is a disc like it it's

4670.4 --> 4674.719
a disc it has a dome

4672.159 --> 4676.48
right these are the traps these are

4674.719 --> 4679.84
things that we don't know

4676.48 --> 4681.04
but that are being forwarded as proof

4679.84 --> 4683.679
that's

4681.04 --> 4683.679
messiah

4683.76 --> 4687.679
that's inserting

4685.44 --> 4689.759999999999
pre-assumed information that you don't

4687.679 --> 4692.56
know

4689.76 --> 4694.96
understand so yeah of course flat earth

4692.56 --> 4696.4800000000005
was always going to be introduced as a

4694.96 --> 4700.88
saya

4696.48 --> 4700.879999999999
that doesn't mean it's fake though

4701.76 --> 4705.92
it just means

4703.12 --> 4708.159
they're desperate to get some grip on

4705.92 --> 4711.679
the development

4708.159 --> 4711.679
that's what that actually means

4715.199 --> 4720.28
hello by the way tara306 good to see you

4730.239 --> 4733.239
dude

4750.08 --> 4755.199
oh okay terra 306 that's i guess that's

4753.199 --> 4758.239
an indian thing

4755.199 --> 4759.199
to go that far

4758.239 --> 4763.718999999999
so

4759.199 --> 4763.719
kind of crude but yeah

4765.6 --> 4771.04
no service day there is no map

4768.719 --> 4773.199
their maps are all projections all of

4771.04 --> 4775.04
the maps are projections all of the maps

4773.199 --> 4776.639999999999
are projections all of the maps are

4775.04 --> 4779.5199999999995
projections all of the maps are

4776.64 --> 4781.1990000000005
projections all of the maps are

4779.52 --> 4784.080000000001
projections

4781.199 --> 4786.719
there's no globe earth map as in a

4784.08 --> 4789.679
accurate representation of the terrain

4786.719 --> 4792.56
there's no flat earth map as in an

4789.679 --> 4795.04
accurate representation of the terrain

4792.56 --> 4798.360000000001
it's all projections

4795.04 --> 4800.88
there is no map that is an accurate

4798.36 --> 4802.159
representation of the terrain it does

4800.88 --> 4805.52
not exist

4802.159 --> 4806.96
at this time not that is available to us

4805.52 --> 4809.1990000000005
anyway

4806.96 --> 4810.56
or that we can

4809.199 --> 4812.159
confirm

4810.56 --> 4814.4800000000005
it is actually an accurate

4812.159 --> 4817.36
representation of the terrain

4814.48 --> 4821.44
right we might have a map that is but we

4817.36 --> 4823.679
don't know even how to confirm that yet

4821.44 --> 4823.678999999999
so

4824.239 --> 4829.759999999999
do you think globe heads have a bad

4827.44 --> 4832.919999999999
well not an accurate representation of

4829.76 --> 4832.92
the terrain

4836.88 --> 4840.2390000000005
i mean yeah we have a map dude i could

4838.96 --> 4842.08
make a map

4840.239 --> 4845.36
i could literally

4842.08 --> 4847.04
make a map right now

4845.36 --> 4851.5599999999995
off earth

4847.04 --> 4851.56
let me do it i'm gonna make a map

4857.19 --> 4860.28
[Music]

4867.44 --> 4872.28
god i'm making a mess of it but [ __ ]

4869.28 --> 4872.28
that

4885.44 --> 4888.44
good

4892.239 --> 4899.5599999999995
wow that's really messy but [ __ ] it

4895.52 --> 4899.56
just improvising anyway

4903.28 --> 4910.32
right there you go you got a map see i

4907.28 --> 4912.4
just made a map this is a map

4910.32 --> 4914.96
it's a map

4912.4 --> 4918.719
this is a map

4914.96 --> 4920.2390000000005
oh it it doesn't accurately represent

4918.719 --> 4922.4800000000005
the terrain

4920.239 --> 4924.799999999999
it doesn't

4922.48 --> 4925.678999999999
well that's not my problem it's a map

4924.8 --> 4927.12
though

4925.679 --> 4929.04
it's a map

4927.12 --> 4930.639
yeah this is a map

4929.04 --> 4932.96
i just made a map

4930.639 --> 4935.04
there is a map i just made it

4932.96 --> 4938.6
it's not an accurate representation of

4935.04 --> 4938.6
the terrain though

4952.48 --> 4957.759999999999
all maps are flat

4955.36 --> 4960.159
can never be associated with well the

4957.76 --> 4962.639
sphere likes to be able to associate

4960.159 --> 4964.96
itself with others this this fear is

4962.639 --> 4966.8
kind of gamma like that

4964.96 --> 4968.96
nobody actually associates with the

4966.8 --> 4970.84
sphere but the sphere does associate

4968.96 --> 4973.52
with others

4970.84 --> 4975.1990000000005
right it's typical gamma

4973.52 --> 4977.679
just always butting into people's

4975.199 --> 4977.678999999999
business

4978.88 --> 4982.4800000000005
but

4981.04 --> 4986.08
yeah

4982.48 --> 4989.04
the terrain is not spherical

4986.08 --> 4991.28
no coordinate system

4989.04 --> 4992.88
that's actually euclidean based is

4991.28 --> 4995.759999999999
spherical

4992.88 --> 4998.96
it's all based on flat and as my title

4995.76 --> 5002.2390000000005
from yesterday's show

4998.96 --> 5005.12
the globe model only works because the

5002.239 --> 5005.12
earth is flat

5012.159 --> 5015.5599999999995
remember that

5017.92 --> 5024.159
that's true it's really hilarious it is

5020.719 --> 5026.639
true the globe model only works

5024.159 --> 5028.96
because the earth is flat

5026.639 --> 5031.679
if the earth was not flat

5028.96 --> 5034.4
they could have never even constructed

5031.679 --> 5036.4800000000005
mathematically the globe model in a way

5034.4 --> 5039.04
that could work out

5036.48 --> 5041.44
they couldn't have even designed the

5039.04 --> 5042.639
fake globe model if the earth wasn't

5041.44 --> 5046.5599999999995
flat

5042.639 --> 5046.56
isn't that just freaking ironic

5047.12 --> 5051.76
and it's true it sounds really silly it

5049.76 --> 5055.400000000001
sounds like i just made it up it's

5051.76 --> 5055.400000000001
actually true

5066.719 --> 5072.4
i'm not gonna allow i'm not gonna do an

5068.96 --> 5072.4
entire show on why

5072.639 --> 5078.56
i might bring it up at the flat earth

5074.239 --> 5080.5599999999995
debates as a subject as a theme one day

5078.56 --> 5083.1990000000005
i just know it is

5080.56 --> 5086.4800000000005
and these are one of those things that i

5083.199 --> 5089.12
know in five years i will turn out to be

5086.48 --> 5091.28
having called it i will be the one that

5089.12 --> 5093.599999999999
called it i will have turned out to be

5091.28 --> 5093.599999999999
right

5094.48 --> 5101.12
and it does typically fit down the lane

5098.32 --> 5103.36
of the whole spirit of it

5101.12 --> 5104.88
it's all trickery

5103.36 --> 5108.08
and it's

5104.88 --> 5110.159000000001
terribly funny it's terribly funny to

5108.08 --> 5111.84
realize that

5110.159 --> 5114.719
if the earth wasn't flat they couldn't

5111.84 --> 5117.1990000000005
even mate the globe model

5114.719 --> 5120.08
they couldn't have made it work

5117.199 --> 5122.96
that's really [ __ ] funny guys

5120.08 --> 5122.96
it really is

5124.719 --> 5129.36
unless you're a devout heliocentric

5127.12 --> 5132.5199999999995
believer and then it's really confusing

5129.36 --> 5132.5199999999995
and frustrating

5146.08 --> 5148.96
oh by the way

5147.84 --> 5150.719
that's

5148.96 --> 5152.639
that's weird

5150.719 --> 5154.719
talking about the devil possessed

5152.639 --> 5157.92
secretly want to meet justice

5154.719 --> 5160.96
i yesterday like was it

5157.92 --> 5163.12
the war room on infowars

5160.96 --> 5164.96
heard the story come by where some

5163.12 --> 5166.88
person

5164.96 --> 5169.52
would actually just murdered a bunch of

5166.88 --> 5171.76
people during a robbery

5169.52 --> 5173.360000000001
he was like pardoned

5171.76 --> 5176.639
he was like given

5173.36 --> 5178.96
the really light punishment by the judge

5176.639 --> 5180.2390000000005
and he was like uh

5178.96 --> 5182.639
no

5180.239 --> 5185.12
that's crazy i deserve the full

5182.639 --> 5188.08
punishment why aren't you letting me off

5185.12 --> 5190.48
that's not justice

5188.08 --> 5192.96
right so it's true

5190.48 --> 5196.5599999999995
like that person knew

5192.96 --> 5198.719
he he wanted the justice he they want

5196.56 --> 5201.360000000001
the justice people

5198.719 --> 5201.36
they want it

5202.719 --> 5208.32
they really do the devil possessed

5205.36 --> 5210.719
really do want to meet justice they want

5208.32 --> 5213.599999999999
that

5210.719 --> 5213.6
they want to be

5213.679 --> 5217.84
not

5214.8 --> 5220.4800000000005
spared i mean being spared would give

5217.84 --> 5222.4800000000005
them a relief on a

5220.48 --> 5224.5599999999995
like a bodily

5222.48 --> 5226.5599999999995
sense like their bodies would be

5224.56 --> 5228.2390000000005
relieved oh thank god we're not gonna

5226.56 --> 5229.4400000000005
sit through punishment or death or

5228.239 --> 5232.159
something

5229.44 --> 5234.32
but their spirit the ones that actually

5232.159 --> 5235.759999999999
makes the decision that drives the

5234.32 --> 5236.5599999999995
consciousness

5235.76 --> 5239.280000000001
it

5236.56 --> 5244.0
wants to meet justice

5239.28 --> 5244.0
it really does and yeah even yesterday

5244.719 --> 5249.36
i heard about a case where yeah somebody

5247.36 --> 5252.239
basically having done the horrific

5249.36 --> 5254.32
things and knowing and admitting it not

5252.239 --> 5256.718999999999
being happy about it not sick but

5254.32 --> 5257.5199999999995
admitting like i was completely [ __ ]

5256.719 --> 5259.92
up

5257.52 --> 5261.84
and he wanted justice and he didn't get

5259.92 --> 5263.92
it he was let off and he was

5261.84 --> 5266.159000000001
dissatisfied about that like this is

5263.92 --> 5268.0
insane he literally in the courtroom

5266.159 --> 5269.679
apparently spoke out like this is not

5268.0 --> 5272.32
justice

5269.679 --> 5274.639
i should not be let off

5272.32 --> 5277.36
right because

5274.639 --> 5279.6
the devil possessed secretly want to

5277.36 --> 5281.759999999999
meet justice

5279.6 --> 5285.04
and when they put on the pedestal in the

5281.76 --> 5287.52
court then that secrecy will come to the

5285.04 --> 5287.5199999999995
surface

5289.36 --> 5292.5199999999995
all right

5301.36 --> 5306.639
if it was a globe then the globe model

5304.32 --> 5308.5599999999995
wouldn't fit no no it's on monkey3d you

5306.639 --> 5310.88
see if the earth was a globe that would

5308.56 --> 5313.92
mean that the entirety

5310.88 --> 5316.8
of natural law and physics doesn't work

5313.92 --> 5319.679
it could never be a globe like that

5316.8 --> 5321.4400000000005
but if some by some arrangement the

5319.679 --> 5323.679
earth was a globe

5321.44 --> 5326.32
then we could have never

5323.679 --> 5328.08
mapped it the way we did like if the

5326.32 --> 5331.759999999999
earth was actually a globe it would

5328.08 --> 5334.48
probably take a lot more time

5331.76 --> 5337.360000000001
before anybody living on that globe

5334.48 --> 5340.0
could ever come to the conclusion that

5337.36 --> 5343.5199999999995
they're living on a globe

5340.0 --> 5343.52
it would take a lot longer

5343.84 --> 5347.4400000000005
right because it would be much more

5345.28 --> 5349.5199999999995
difficult to map out the terrain you

5347.44 --> 5351.599999999999
can't see as far

5349.52 --> 5352.400000000001
like

5351.6 --> 5353.280000000001
so

5352.4 --> 5354.32
yeah

5353.28 --> 5357.28
if your

5354.32 --> 5359.679
view is very limited

5357.28 --> 5361.36
that means exploration is tougher and

5359.679 --> 5363.12
more hazardous

5361.36 --> 5365.36
that means that you're not going to be

5363.12 --> 5367.84
able to map it all out

5365.36 --> 5370.239
as quickly it's going to take a lot more

5367.84 --> 5370.2390000000005
effort

5370.88 --> 5374.96
and the math would make it very

5373.28 --> 5378.159
difficult

5374.96 --> 5382.8
because how do you actually

5378.159 --> 5382.799999999999
model a globe in the euclidean sense

5382.96 --> 5386.4800000000005
that's extremely difficult

5386.719 --> 5391.44
it is how are you gonna map that that's

5389.44 --> 5393.36
crazy

5391.44 --> 5394.32
like that's literally

5393.36 --> 5396.719
really

5394.32 --> 5400.639
tedious

5396.719 --> 5403.12
mathematically right but it's easy

5400.639 --> 5405.36
to presuppose a globe when you're

5403.12 --> 5407.76
dealing with a flat surface

5405.36 --> 5409.599999999999
it's a really easy fold

5407.76 --> 5412.4800000000005
right because that's what it is you just

5409.6 --> 5415.280000000001
fold that flat surface over a globe it's

5412.48 --> 5417.919999999999
much easier than actually trying to map

5415.28 --> 5420.5599999999995
out the terrain that would be a globe

5417.92 --> 5423.679
it's much easier to do it like that

5420.56 --> 5426.400000000001
so yeah globers are really lucky

5423.679 --> 5429.84
globe believers globe zealots are really

5426.4 --> 5432.879999999999
lucky that the earth is actually flat

5429.84 --> 5435.76
otherwise their globe religion

5432.88 --> 5438.639
might have never come around

5435.76 --> 5440.8
because it would have taken too long and

5438.639 --> 5444.1990000000005
would be too difficult to actually map

5440.8 --> 5444.1990000000005
out the terrain

5453.36 --> 5456.36
right

5465.44 --> 5468.44
hmm

5476.639 --> 5481.04
only a liar and con man yeah well terry

5479.12 --> 5482.32
306 that was

5481.04 --> 5483.6
yeah

5482.32 --> 5486.4
absolutely

5483.6 --> 5490.400000000001
that's what they were

5486.4 --> 5492.719
they were very informed trixie wizards

5490.4 --> 5494.239
that were atheist they did not believe

5492.719 --> 5496.56
in god

5494.239 --> 5498.4
right that's what i think in the bible's

5496.56 --> 5499.84
warn about too when they talk about

5498.4 --> 5501.199
astrologers

5499.84 --> 5503.92
it's not like

5501.199 --> 5506.799999999999
oh astrology is evil no it's the

5503.92 --> 5508.96
astrologers that are atheists that are

5506.8 --> 5511.679
trying to use their knowledge to trick

5508.96 --> 5513.679
you into believing there is no god

5511.679 --> 5514.8
that's basically they're warning you for

5513.679 --> 5516.84
atheism

5514.8 --> 5520.0
not for like the astrology

5516.84 --> 5522.719
itself it's just that at the time

5520.0 --> 5525.36
the ones that were really good at it

5522.719 --> 5527.92
sometimes secretly were atheists and

5525.36 --> 5529.839999999999
kind of evil like that and amoral and

5527.92 --> 5532.4
all that

5529.84 --> 5534.88
they were dangerous back then they were

5532.4 --> 5534.879999999999
wizards

5535.36 --> 5540.0
and they had to keep it a secret because

5537.44 --> 5542.48
there were still laws against blasphemy

5540.0 --> 5543.52
you would die you would be executed

5542.48 --> 5544.839999999999
right

5543.52 --> 5547.360000000001
if you admitted

5544.84 --> 5548.400000000001
it so

5547.36 --> 5551.199
yeah

5548.4 --> 5551.199
it makes sense

5564.08 --> 5568.719
but yeah the globe earth

5566.32 --> 5571.36
belongs in the

5568.719 --> 5573.44
in the category of circus entertainment

5571.36 --> 5577.12
it really does

5573.44 --> 5577.12
it's just little magicians trick

5577.76 --> 5581.719
except really elaborate

5596.08 --> 5600.4
okay flat map of flat earth should be

5598.88 --> 5604.96
yet

5600.4 --> 5604.96
there we go again that yeah but we do

5605.199 --> 5608.719
all the maps are flat because maps are

5607.84 --> 5610.639
flat

5608.719 --> 5611.92
they're all flat

5610.639 --> 5614.08
right but they're still going to be

5611.92 --> 5616.639
projections based on the available

5614.08 --> 5619.679
knowledge there is

5616.639 --> 5624.4800000000005
which are at this stage this is how it's

5619.679 --> 5628.88
done derived from the celestial lights

5624.48 --> 5628.879999999999
which are apparently spherical

5629.44 --> 5631.839999999999
right

5632.239 --> 5637.839999999999
it's kind of complicated like that

5635.12 --> 5639.92
or it started out complicated

5637.84 --> 5642.08
but yeah look there

5639.92 --> 5645.6
there's definitely an opportunity to

5642.08 --> 5648.88
figure out the exact terrain as it is

5645.6 --> 5648.88
it's there it exists

5649.04 --> 5653.6
we are not

5650.239 --> 5656.839999999999
actually dependent purely on

5653.6 --> 5659.84
the celestial lights anymore for our map

5656.84 --> 5664.8
orientation we can literally

5659.84 --> 5667.679
scan and size up exact distances

5664.8 --> 5671.04
right that's a big difference

5667.679 --> 5673.76
so the terrain can be perfectly exactly

5671.04 --> 5677.04
map now

5673.76 --> 5679.84
and yeah i'm really curious to learn

5677.04 --> 5682.32
it yeah if it's already been done

5679.84 --> 5685.119000000001
and what that's like

5682.32 --> 5687.36
like what what will it turn out to be

5685.119 --> 5690.32
like

5687.36 --> 5692.799999999999
and yeah do my theories hold water is

5690.32 --> 5694.96
space linear is it perfectly linear or

5692.8 --> 5697.92
is it just not linear

5694.96 --> 5698.84
and will the scans yield that will

5697.92 --> 5703.04
the

5698.84 --> 5704.88
terrain not actually fit

5703.04 --> 5706.56
like the scans it's like yeah they fit

5704.88 --> 5709.04
next to one another but when you then

5706.56 --> 5712.400000000001
try to close it close the loop it

5709.04 --> 5715.28
doesn't fit right spatial non-linearity

5712.4 --> 5717.679
i'm really curious to see

5715.28 --> 5721.759999999999
if i was right

5717.679 --> 5721.76
with my conceptual idea about it

5722.159 --> 5726.839999999999
like eight years ago

5725.679 --> 5730.4
was it

5726.84 --> 5732.400000000001
eight yeah 2015.

5730.4 --> 5734.48
like when the first flat earth came onto

5732.4 --> 5737.679
the scene i did

5734.48 --> 5740.159
think about it special non-linearity

5737.679 --> 5742.08
just like i did holographic sun

5740.159 --> 5743.44
that's where it started like a real

5742.08 --> 5746.5599999999995
flutter look at the disc look at the

5743.44 --> 5749.5199999999995
dome i'm like uh sun holographic

5746.56 --> 5751.280000000001
uh space not entirely linear

5749.52 --> 5753.1990000000005
and that's how i started

5751.28 --> 5755.5199999999995
even before i actually started doing

5753.199 --> 5757.599999999999
shows

5755.52 --> 5758.4800000000005
right and so i'm really curious was i

5757.6 --> 5761.6
right

5758.48 --> 5761.599999999999
did i see it right

5762.159 --> 5767.96
was i on to something

5764.96 --> 5767.96
hmm

5776.0 --> 5781.36
no no tara 306 that's ridiculous

5780.48 --> 5782.4
you're

5781.36 --> 5784.719
look

5782.4 --> 5786.48
i tried to be harsh

5784.719 --> 5788.4800000000005
and rough

5786.48 --> 5792.159
but

5788.48 --> 5794.638999999999
like okay you're now just raving like a

5792.159 --> 5794.638999999999
maniac

5796.719 --> 5799.84
this is ridiculous

5801.6 --> 5805.280000000001
so the

5802.719 --> 5806.4
teachers should not be executed

5805.28 --> 5808.96
especially

5806.4 --> 5811.119
nasa related [ __ ] look if you have a

5808.96 --> 5812.719
problem with them

5811.119 --> 5816.5599999999995
just

5812.719 --> 5818.88
don't allow the sh the school to

5816.56 --> 5820.56
carry that curriculum right you don't

5818.88 --> 5822.639
why would you kill them that makes no

5820.56 --> 5827.080000000001
sense they're just

5822.639 --> 5827.08
they're just doing their discipline

5828.239 --> 5830.5599999999995
right

5830.96 --> 5835.44
i mean if those same teachers are going

5833.119 --> 5837.44
to be like oh take the box take the

5835.44 --> 5840.159
facts and like manipulating their

5837.44 --> 5842.5599999999995
students on a personal level to get it

5840.159 --> 5845.28
yeah that's another matter but not just

5842.56 --> 5846.96
because they're they're teaching globe

5845.28 --> 5849.28
stuff

5846.96 --> 5853.0
it's ridiculous

5849.28 --> 5853.0
it's just philosophy

5856.159 --> 5859.36
no

5857.44 --> 5863.678999999999
no no no

5859.36 --> 5865.679
no no no no tara 306

5863.679 --> 5866.96
you you're off the track you're off the

5865.679 --> 5869.4400000000005
rails man

5866.96 --> 5869.44
just know

5870.56 --> 5876.96
nobody should ever be killed just

5873.04 --> 5880.199
because they have a philosophical idea

5876.96 --> 5880.199
it's ridiculous

5882.8 --> 5888.0
like that's a really

5885.52 --> 5892.159000000001
really terrible decision

5888.0 --> 5897.719
to go with that that's actual barbarism

5892.159 --> 5897.719
never go with that i never go with that

5905.04 --> 5910.719
i'm serious dude like i already feel

5908.32 --> 5911.759999999999
like with what i do i'm slightly over

5910.719 --> 5915.36
the top

5911.76 --> 5918.639
in the risk zone you're going way

5915.36 --> 5922.199
way over the top there terra 306

5918.639 --> 5922.1990000000005
that's just barbaric

5932.08 --> 5937.6
if you won't ever change uncover

5934.239 --> 5939.919999999999
cultists well yeah but tear it look

5937.6 --> 5942.96
that's a good point but that's because

5939.92 --> 5945.28
that actually gets people killed

5942.96 --> 5946.56
and medically mutilated right that's

5945.28 --> 5948.32
different

5946.56 --> 5949.84
as i said

5948.32 --> 5953.199
like

5949.84 --> 5955.52
these same nasa teachers or whatever are

5953.199 --> 5957.839999999999
going to literally

5955.52 --> 5960.159000000001
get involved with

5957.84 --> 5962.400000000001
forcing people to get jabs or

5960.159 --> 5964.32
manipulating them into that's different

5962.4 --> 5966.32
but that's because there's people

5964.32 --> 5968.48
actually being physically armed out of

5966.32 --> 5968.48
it

5969.76 --> 5975.6
but not just because of the globe ideas

5973.199 --> 5977.04
no matter if it's lies no matter if it's

5975.6 --> 5979.119000000001
machinations

5977.04 --> 5980.44
no

5979.119 --> 5984.0
now that's

5980.44 --> 5985.5199999999995
absolutely not execute worthy like not

5984.0 --> 5988.32
even close

5985.52 --> 5992.92
i don't understand how you could just

5988.32 --> 5992.92
lay it down like that i really don't

5997.36 --> 6002.0
you tested me yeah why why did you get

5999.679 --> 6004.639
tested jared why do you allow yourself

6002.0 --> 6007.639
to be tested

6004.639 --> 6007.639
why

6009.28 --> 6013.44
that i mean that's kind of on you

6013.52 --> 6017.119000000001
the tests don't work they're admitted

6015.92 --> 6019.119
not to work

6017.119 --> 6022.48
for what they're supposedly being used

6019.119 --> 6024.239
for they don't work by the designer

6022.48 --> 6027.04
right the designer said doesn't work

6024.239 --> 6030.32
like that this is not functional

6027.04 --> 6034.28
you shouldn't be using it like that

6030.32 --> 6034.28
right so yeah

6042.88 --> 6045.88
right

6045.9 --> 6049.0599999999995
[Music]

6069.28 --> 6073.36
so what oh yeah stone monkey three i'll

6071.6 --> 6077.159000000001
i'll answer that question and then i'm

6073.36 --> 6077.159
gonna round out the show

6080.0 --> 6085.199
right so what would non-linearity of

6082.8 --> 6087.84
space cause distances over the surface

6085.199 --> 6090.159
of earth to match

6087.84 --> 6093.679
what they would be on a globe well yeah

6090.159 --> 6097.119
that's the thing you got the flat globe

6093.679 --> 6100.4800000000005
so yeah that's in my very very first

6097.119 --> 6102.5599999999995
live show on this channel

6100.48 --> 6105.678999999999
i laid it out as an option the flat

6102.56 --> 6106.8
globe it would be the ultimate irony

6105.679 --> 6109.76
right

6106.8 --> 6113.52
so what if the realms confine and that

6109.76 --> 6115.76
means literally the volume available

6113.52 --> 6118.719
for matter to exist in

6115.76 --> 6121.119000000001
and how it interconnects with itself

6118.719 --> 6123.04
like a self-contained wormhole if you

6121.119 --> 6126.719
want to go through the science fiction

6123.04 --> 6128.639
route of description

6126.719 --> 6131.04
yeah it could turn out to be

6128.639 --> 6133.52
interconnected like a globe which is

6131.04 --> 6133.5199999999995
crazy

6133.76 --> 6137.04
that's like

6135.04 --> 6139.84
the designer saying

6137.04 --> 6141.76
oh you think you're [ __ ] smart people

6139.84 --> 6144.56
you think you're smart oh why don't you

6141.76 --> 6146.639
deal with a [ __ ] flat globe yeah why

6144.56 --> 6148.4800000000005
don't you deal with that see if you can

6146.639 --> 6151.76
wrap your head around that

6148.48 --> 6152.799999999999
humans you think you're so smart

6151.76 --> 6155.679
right

6152.8 --> 6158.96
it might be that it might be

6155.679 --> 6162.2390000000005
literal flat every part of it is flat

6158.96 --> 6164.159
but when you then put every scan segment

6162.239 --> 6167.599999999999
right next to each other

6164.159 --> 6170.08
it's all flat it's always flat but then

6167.6 --> 6172.8
when you zoom out and you see the little

6170.08 --> 6174.159
segments all scanned all put together it

6172.8 --> 6177.1990000000005
just like

6174.159 --> 6179.759999999999
it doesn't fit it it

6177.199 --> 6183.36
when you try to fit it it kind of starts

6179.76 --> 6187.119000000001
clicking in and turning into a glow

6183.36 --> 6189.44
despite every part being potentially

6187.119 --> 6191.679
scanned to the millimeter maybe

6189.44 --> 6195.839999999999
exaggerated centimeter whatever

6191.679 --> 6196.88
but like really accurately scanned flat

6195.84 --> 6200.56
right

6196.88 --> 6203.92
yeah then you got a flat globe

6200.56 --> 6205.119000000001
and a flat globe would only be possible

6203.92 --> 6207.28
only

6205.119 --> 6208.799999999999
under the condition that space is not

6207.28 --> 6212.159
linear

6208.8 --> 6214.08
because in a euclidean

6212.159 --> 6217.839999999999
space where everything is perfectly

6214.08 --> 6220.8
linearly interconnected

6217.84 --> 6223.28
where everything is exactly as is as we

6220.8 --> 6224.88
would represent in a mini scale

6223.28 --> 6227.28
if we could

6224.88 --> 6230.4800000000005
literally represent the entirety of

6227.28 --> 6234.159
earth in a miniature

6230.48 --> 6236.32
then space could not be linear

6234.159 --> 6240.239
because space not being linear is all

6236.32 --> 6241.04
about how does this space available to

6240.239 --> 6244.239
us

6241.04 --> 6245.199
interconnect with itself

6244.239 --> 6249.678999999999
that's

6245.199 --> 6249.678999999999
what spatial non-linearity is all about

6254.48 --> 6260.718999999999
that's right stone monkey 3d exactly

6258.56 --> 6263.280000000001
right because the rectangular looping

6260.719 --> 6266.08
model is is still just a model it's

6263.28 --> 6268.08
still just a projection based

6266.08 --> 6269.6
representation

6268.08 --> 6272.32
i don't know if it's literally

6269.6 --> 6273.4400000000005
rectangular right all these traits need

6272.32 --> 6275.759999999999
to be

6273.44 --> 6279.199
figured out and measured like is the

6275.76 --> 6282.159000000001
equator line which is a derived

6279.199 --> 6284.48
line based on celestial orientation

6282.159 --> 6287.119
but is it a circle

6284.48 --> 6289.759999999999
is it a straight line or is it a

6287.119 --> 6291.679
incomplete circle is it an arc what is

6289.76 --> 6293.84
it we need to know

6291.679 --> 6296.88
we need to know to really figure out

6293.84 --> 6298.08
what the terrain is actually like

6296.88 --> 6300.639
and

6298.08 --> 6303.679
what the confine of the terrain is

6300.639 --> 6305.28
actually like and if yeah that com draws

6303.679 --> 6308.08
the conclusion

6305.28 --> 6310.08
that space is not linear

6308.08 --> 6312.159
yeah then it makes everything more

6310.08 --> 6314.32
complicated but at least we can let go

6312.159 --> 6315.199
of our euclidean assumptions of the

6314.32 --> 6318.239
realm

6315.199 --> 6319.839999999999
and realize we are in a surreal

6318.239 --> 6322.879999999999
matrix

6319.84 --> 6325.119000000001
simulation like situation considering

6322.88 --> 6327.6
space

6325.119 --> 6329.04
and that's it that's just the reality

6327.6 --> 6331.4400000000005
then

6329.04 --> 6334.44
but we need to measure these details

6331.44 --> 6334.44
first

6350.08 --> 6353.92
that's right flatter sage by the way

6351.679 --> 6356.159
thank you for supporting me in that

6353.92 --> 6358.159
this is neil degrasse tyson it's just

6356.159 --> 6362.08
they're just puppets most of these

6358.159 --> 6362.08
spokespeople are just puppets

6363.119 --> 6367.759999999999
right

6364.4 --> 6367.759999999999
they're they're just puppets

6370.4 --> 6375.839999999999
they just tell a good story and yeah if

6373.44 --> 6377.28
you believe that story it's kind of your

6375.84 --> 6379.76
problem

6377.28 --> 6382.159
it really works like that

6379.76 --> 6382.159000000001
anyway

6383.84 --> 6388.159000000001
let me check my paypal one more time

6391.52 --> 6397.280000000001
oh

6392.719 --> 6397.28
i did get some nice 360.

6397.36 --> 6402.239
from

6398.239 --> 6402.239
i i don't know who that is

6402.4 --> 6406.4
thank you very much whoever gave that to

6404.239 --> 6406.4
me

6408.239 --> 6411.44
every little bit helps

6412.239 --> 6415.839999999999
so i really appreciate that

6424.239 --> 6428.04
right anyway

6445.679 --> 6453.56
right yeah i am gonna round out the show

6449.119 --> 6453.5599999999995
got you guys all riled up

6459.199 --> 6462.96
very much over the place

6464.48 --> 6467.44
with today's show

6468.4 --> 6472.879999999999
yeah i'd love to insert like this

6474.0 --> 6478.159
special non-linearity and how to figure

6476.719 --> 6479.76
out

6478.159 --> 6481.5199999999995
the map

6479.76 --> 6483.92
i'd love to fit that in the title too

6481.52 --> 6485.280000000001
but i don't think i can it's the title's

6483.92 --> 6486.159
already kind of big

6485.28 --> 6488.08
so

6486.159 --> 6489.839999999999
i'm just gonna round out thanks

6488.08 --> 6492.08
everybody for coming

6496.48 --> 6499.5199999999995
said was

6497.6 --> 6502.400000000001
really relevant

6499.52 --> 6503.280000000001
and requires like thought careful

6502.4 --> 6505.36
thought

6503.28 --> 6507.599999999999

they'll be much appreciated

6530.159 --> 6533.679

small one i don't know who that was but

6538.32 --> 6543.04
thank you very much

i got enough for this weekend but after

6548.96 --> 6555.04
that it's gonna be zero

6552.159 --> 6557.04
just so you know it is it's not

6555.04 --> 6560.159
because i'm wasting money it's because i

6557.04 --> 6562.88
literally i'm on the edge of broke

6560.159 --> 6565.28
so i really need continued support i

6562.88 --> 6565.28
mean it

6565.44 --> 6570.4
like at least for the next week

6568.96 --> 6571.28
and two days

6570.4 --> 6572.96
right

6571.28 --> 6575.36
so

6572.96 --> 6577.36
if yeah again if you like the show

6577.36 --> 6580.639
otherwise it's yeah it's not gonna be as

6579.52 --> 6582.400000000001
good

6580.639 --> 6584.8
and i might get

6582.4 --> 6588.0
stressed out again and

6584.8 --> 6590.0
just maybe not show up anymore

6588.0 --> 6592.4
i really do

6590.0 --> 6594.48
want to show up

6592.4 --> 6597.199
but it's almost like i can't show up

6594.48 --> 6600.5599999999995
anymore if i don't get support

6597.199 --> 6602.799999999999
i would have to re basically retract

6600.56 --> 6604.080000000001
even if i don't want to i would have to

6602.8 --> 6607.119000000001
do that

6604.08 --> 6611.04
because i can't just

6607.119 --> 6613.92
act like i can stream for free

6611.04 --> 6617.04
i can't do that i'm not in the luxury

6613.92 --> 6619.52
position to be able to do that i really

6617.04 --> 6621.599
really need support it's not a joke it's

6619.52 --> 6624.719
not a ruse

6621.599 --> 6626.639
it's real i really need it

6624.719 --> 6629.44
so please

6626.639 --> 6631.76
support your local army right

6629.44 --> 6633.08
so i will be back tomorrow flat earth

6631.76 --> 6635.599
early bird number

6633.08 --> 6638.4
1128 on the sunday

6635.599 --> 6641.04
so i hope to see you all then

6638.4 --> 6642.239
2 p.m amsterdam time again

6641.04 --> 6645.76
and

6642.239 --> 6649.199
uh there might be a ball busters

6645.76 --> 6651.119000000001
later this evening i'm not 100 sure

6649.199 --> 6653.839999999999
but yeah if it's gonna be live i'll be

6651.119 --> 6653.839999999999
on it

6653.92 --> 6660.679
and until the next video

6657.04 --> 6660.679
keep it flat

6660.72 --> 6674.27
[Music]

6672.32 --> 6692.009999999999
so

6674.27 --> 6692.01
[Music]

6706.96 --> 6709.04
you
