as you can clearly see

132.0 --> 135.76
i'm kind of tense today

136.239 --> 140.879
i was yesterday as well but today it's

138.56 --> 140.879
worse

141.52 --> 146.08
i'm still drying up from sweating from

144.239 --> 148.08
all the yelling

146.08 --> 149.92000000000002
because i'm kind of pissed off i also

148.08 --> 153.28
express that to one of the

149.92 --> 153.83999999999997
store owners not that the supermarket

153.28 --> 156.72
but

153.84 --> 158.31900000000002
that kind of knows that about me and he

156.72 --> 161.68
basically said oh did you hear

158.319 --> 165.2
that prime minister wants to

161.68 --> 171.84
create a policy of mandatory vaccination

165.2 --> 171.83999999999997
that doesn't piss me off at all

172.64 --> 175.2
so yeah

178.64 --> 185.83999999999997
all right eight terabit 3006

182.159 --> 185.84
patricia dockery

188.239 --> 199.84
why is a snoop dog that's that sentence

191.599 --> 199.83999999999997
makes no sense

208.72 --> 214.48
i've never heard of it

212.72 --> 216.959
all right i've been quite yes busy

214.48 --> 221.11999999999998
yesterday

216.959 --> 221.12
plenty of shows hangouts

221.599 --> 224.84
was of course the flat earth debate

223.28 --> 228.799
which was really good

224.84 --> 231.12
again i did my newspaper rounds

228.799 --> 234.15900000000002
everything worked out fine

231.12 --> 236.56
kept it dry as i predicted

234.159 --> 238.72
later in the evening it did can kind of

236.56 --> 241.92000000000002
get cloudy and gray

238.72 --> 243.04
so yeah happened exactly as i said it

241.92 --> 245.76
would

243.04 --> 246.159
and this morning it was kind of well oh

245.76 --> 249.51899999999998
wait

246.159 --> 251.12
totally forgot this morning it was more

249.519 --> 252.84
like

251.12 --> 254.56
[Music]

252.84 --> 256.639
that

254.56 --> 258.479
and it's even a little bit more like

256.639 --> 262.0
this now so

258.479 --> 263.919
but despite that it's really cold

262.0 --> 267.12
not so windy as it was yesterday but

263.919 --> 267.12
it's like water cold and

267.68 --> 272.72
yeah it's winter

278.32 --> 283.84
i really trying to calm down here

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
because

285.12 --> 290.88
it's just the antihistamines making me

288.4 --> 290.88
shaky

292.72 --> 299.759
all right so yeah yeah i also

297.36 --> 300.8
saw roxanne global's denier went live

299.759 --> 303.84000000000003
with some protest

300.8 --> 306.08
news and the five minutes of mute

303.84 --> 308.08
i told her i would make a note of so she

306.08 --> 309.35999999999996
was reading out a news article for five

308.08 --> 312.15999999999997
minutes

309.36 --> 313.759
completely muted that was really silly

312.16 --> 314.40000000000003
but yeah other than that pretty good

313.759 --> 317.44
show

314.4 --> 320.71999999999997
and she's really trying to be like the

317.44 --> 322.479
sort of a grassroots news and she's

320.72 --> 325.759
getting much better at it and like the

322.479 --> 328.88
show is pretty good organized

325.759 --> 332.47900000000004
so yeah i like that uh

328.88 --> 332.479
after that also somewhere

333.199 --> 337.6
yeah rodrigo ferrari nunes went live

335.36 --> 339.44
again this time reviewing contact

337.6 --> 341.6
i didn't sit through the whole thing as

339.44 --> 343.52
if that said through the last part

341.6 --> 344.72
but that was really interesting i always

343.52 --> 348.24
do report uh

344.72 --> 351.28000000000003
do appreciate his

348.24 --> 353.199
sci-fi movie reviews that he does and it

351.28 --> 356.31899999999996
was really interesting and yeah i had a

353.199 --> 359.84000000000003
lot of side notes on top of that i even

356.319 --> 360.72
created or basically figured out a

359.84 --> 363.52
potential

360.72 --> 367.84000000000003
conspiracy back layer of the entire

363.52 --> 367.84
movie that's not that apparent

368.0 --> 373.28
i thought that was pretty cool that i

370.56 --> 373.28000000000003
figured that out

374.4 --> 377.84
like how would the entire story be set

377.52 --> 380.4
up

377.84 --> 381.75899999999996
from the perspective that basically the

380.4 --> 384.96
main character is not

381.759 --> 388.08000000000004
in the know that it is all a giant

384.96 --> 389.919
occult scam yeah

388.08 --> 394.0
and that it was actually designed to

389.919 --> 395.75899999999996
bankrupt the country

394.0 --> 398.319
what the movie is set up like it's like

395.759 --> 400.88
oh you got this alien signal whatever

398.319 --> 402.8
right then oh a millionaire billionaire

400.88 --> 405.44
whatever is dying in spruce

402.8 --> 407.28000000000003
blah and giving all this money to build

405.44 --> 410.0
these things which are like a

407.28 --> 412.63899999999995
billion a piece or more insane one of

410.0 --> 417.28
them blows up

412.639 --> 419.759
and then just to do that little test

417.28 --> 420.96
and after that yeah the movie ends and

419.759 --> 423.759
then of course

420.96 --> 424.88
a few months later federal reserves

423.759 --> 429.36
calls the president

424.88 --> 432.15999999999997
yeah we're bankrupt right now

429.36 --> 433.199
and then a civil war broke out like in

432.16 --> 435.36
the contact

433.199 --> 437.759
universe like they don't show that part

435.36 --> 440.24
like that entire thing is completely

437.759 --> 440.24
insane

441.28 --> 448.52
as a science fiction movie it was

444.479 --> 451.36
okay there was a lot of whining

448.52 --> 453.44
philosophizing about god and now if you

451.36 --> 457.44
believe in god it's not legitimate

453.44 --> 459.36
all that atheist 90s [ __ ]

457.44 --> 465.84
before we all kind of figured out what

459.36 --> 465.84000000000003
was actually going on here

468.08 --> 474.31899999999996
when does it start snowing at your place

470.24 --> 476.639
uh it rarely does tear it 306

474.319 --> 478.08000000000004
but if it does it usually does so around

476.639 --> 481.199
my birthday which is like at the

478.08 --> 481.199
beginning of february

481.599 --> 485.36
but yeah there's no guarantee it is

483.36 --> 486.72
gonna snow it is a sea climate here

485.36 --> 490.47900000000004
after all

486.72 --> 490.47900000000004
so it's not that likely as more land

490.84 --> 496.0
inwards

492.16 --> 498.08000000000004
yes i heard m c tunes talked about me

496.0 --> 500.56
maybe a good motivator on the debate yes

498.08 --> 502.15999999999997
really cute

500.56 --> 504.319
he could also just come on the flat

502.16 --> 506.879
earth debate and behave

504.319 --> 507.52000000000004
like a proper human being and answer

506.879 --> 510.0
direct

507.52 --> 511.599
questions no matter the cost just answer

510.0 --> 513.12
it no matter the cost

511.599 --> 515.5989999999999
and those things will be all right now

513.12 --> 519.44
if he's not gonna do that

515.599 --> 521.6800000000001
then i am not gonna be a good moderator

519.44 --> 523.12
for the debate either because i am gonna

521.68 --> 525.5999999999999
do exactly the same

523.12 --> 527.12
thing as nathan would maybe less

525.6 --> 530.64
punishing and just tell them

527.12 --> 533.279
answer the question right now right now

530.64 --> 536.8
right now that if yeah so it's not gonna

533.279 --> 539.2
make too much of a difference in the end

536.8 --> 540.399
if he wants to have a debate nathan or

539.2 --> 544.24
something

540.399 --> 544.72
that's fine he should be able to just do

544.24 --> 547.519
that

544.72 --> 548.1600000000001
just because these freaks these

547.519 --> 551.76
religious

548.16 --> 553.36
zealots act like complete freaks

551.76 --> 555.6
on the flat earth debates doesn't mean

553.36 --> 556.5600000000001
that he will be automatically treated

555.6 --> 558.72
the same

556.56 --> 563.8389999999999
unless he starts behaving the same way

558.72 --> 563.839
so that's completely up to him

569.04 --> 577.8389999999999
right so yeah i already know

572.72 --> 577.839
i relayed that message yesterday

586.0 --> 591.839
right anyway

600.56 --> 607.279
hey samson

605.36 --> 608.8000000000001
right uh yeah the notes were not too

607.279 --> 611.279
elaborate though

608.8 --> 613.279
but yeah i went to bed had a pretty good

611.279 --> 615.279
sleep

613.279 --> 616.72
oh yeah that was a weird little yeah i

615.279 --> 619.2
had this

616.72 --> 620.0790000000001
in between sleep was weird like around

619.2 --> 624.0790000000001
six o'clock

620.079 --> 624.8
i like got super fatigued after i had my

624.079 --> 626.56
dinner

624.8 --> 628.3199999999999
right after the newspaper round and i

626.56 --> 631.279
slept for like two hours

628.32 --> 632.8000000000001
that's i remember having done that

631.279 --> 634.32
before in the past

632.8 --> 636.24
like even last year and everything has

634.32 --> 638.0790000000001
just been a while since that happened

636.24 --> 640.72
but it was a good it was really like

638.079 --> 642.959
this catch-ups little sleep

640.72 --> 645.12
and it did a lot of good i came out of

642.959 --> 648.16
it a little woozy it usually happens

645.12 --> 652.0
i sleep at unusual times

648.16 --> 653.12
but i think it did help my metabolism to

652.0 --> 656.77
restore

653.12 --> 658.839
certain things that were playing in the

656.77 --> 661.8389999999999
[Music]

658.839 --> 661.839
background

670.32 --> 675.839
[Music]

672.839 --> 675.839
right

683.8 --> 690.64
[Music]

686.16 --> 690.64
right so anyway uh i'm here

690.8 --> 697.12
shows running i'm open for questions

694.56 --> 698.8
also for newcomers there have been a lot

697.12 --> 702.9590000000001
of newcomers recently

698.8 --> 706.56
through other channels too

702.959 --> 709.04
so don't feel shy to ask

706.56 --> 710.399
what you might feel maybe stupid

709.04 --> 712.56
questions

710.399 --> 714.88
if you are a newcomer because yeah

712.56 --> 717.04
that's just necessary it's necessary to

714.88 --> 719.12
ask every question

717.04 --> 721.12
don't be ashamed just because you're in

719.12 --> 723.2
the presence of people that are like

721.12 --> 726.88
five or two years ahead of you don't

723.2 --> 729.6800000000001
worry about it just ask the questions

726.88 --> 731.8389999999999
don't worry about it i will be able to

729.68 --> 731.8389999999999
tell

732.16 --> 737.6
whether you are a newcomer or

735.279 --> 738.88
like a baller zealot trying to troll me

737.6 --> 745.839
or anything

738.88 --> 745.8389999999999
don't worry about it

754.24 --> 759.839
tea needs to cool off i want to drink it

762.959 --> 769.8389999999999
because i need to cool off too sheesh

766.0 --> 769.839
i'm still wet from sweating

770.24 --> 773.92
because when i get really full lungs

772.32 --> 776.1600000000001
pissed off i start

773.92 --> 777.279
like serious sweat breaks out on me like

776.16 --> 779.92
i was literally

777.279 --> 781.279
like sweating like a like it was

779.92 --> 787.8389999999999
mid-summer or something

781.279 --> 787.8389999999999
not even half an hour ago

790.079 --> 794.5699999999999
did someone say my name hey

792.2 --> 797.6790000000001
drunkenbollet411

794.57 --> 797.6790000000001
[Music]

799.68 --> 802.8
the mask zealous dislike my show yeah

801.68 --> 806.399
well because they

802.8 --> 810.079
are marxist mind control

806.399 --> 813.04
surrenderist slaves and slaves don't

810.079 --> 814.2399999999999
like it when people try to take their

813.04 --> 818.88
chains off

814.24 --> 818.88
i know i don't care

819.6 --> 823.44
they act like that i'm just gonna treat

821.6 --> 829.839
them like the slaves

823.44 --> 829.839
that they are

836.64 --> 842.16
[Music]

838.56 --> 846.079
right by the way that doesn't mean that

842.16 --> 848.24
yeah here out here nobody's bothering me

846.079 --> 849.8389999999999
nobody nobody's bothering me about a

848.24 --> 852.0
mask about anything

849.839 --> 855.12
but he's being extremely polite mass

852.0 --> 855.12
square is included

855.44 --> 859.7600000000001
it's very smart of them they might be

858.24 --> 862.8
looking at me and just

859.76 --> 863.279
reading all that suppressed anger about

862.8 --> 866.3199999999999
being

863.279 --> 869.519
severely pissed off about the situation

866.32 --> 871.0400000000001
and being able to politely suppress that

869.519 --> 872.88
they probably know like yeah if i'm

871.04 --> 876.56
gonna wind against this guy

872.88 --> 880.0
i'm gonna get an explosion

876.56 --> 882.2399999999999
intuitively so and that's very smart of

880.0 --> 882.24
them

883.6 --> 887.44
because if you're gonna try to whine to

885.92 --> 887.92
me that i'm supposed to be wearing a

887.44 --> 890.0790000000001
mask

887.92 --> 892.0
i'm gonna give out everything everything

890.079 --> 892.56
that i know that it's all a hundred

892.0 --> 896.36
percent

892.56 --> 898.8299999999999
fake out medical industrialist

the pro the trial run for this and all

961.92 --> 965.4399999999999
take

962.32 --> 967.759
the mandatory vaccines

965.44 --> 970.0790000000001
and then when a lot of them come false

967.759 --> 972.0790000000001

if people are having convulsions and

it's it's just yeah

that [ __ ] tiny womble

1104.64 --> 1109.8400000000001
all vaccines should be abolished

it's over it's over

show that they do

that's taken a vaccine why don't you

look at the statistics

why don't you look at how many of them

1205.36 --> 1209.1999999999998
actually get the freaking disease

when people not taking the [ __ ]

is literally the disease

yeah yeah great

yeah keep doing that keep doing that

keep taking it every [ __ ] year

1255.28 --> 1259.2
a lung disease

1256.159 --> 1263.0390000000002
you're gonna die of it

very bad lungs

1265.039 --> 1268.8799999999999
constantly sick because that's what

happens to people that

1268.88 --> 1275.679
regularly take flu vaccines i've

1272.24 --> 1278.559
seen it i've seen people that do that

1278.559 --> 1291.84
all year long

1280.159 --> 1291.8400000000001

yeah you can't sue them well you don't

1296.159 --> 1299.3600000000001
need to sue them you just need to make

1298.159 --> 1305.8400000000001
it illegal and

1299.36 --> 1305.84
kick them out of the country

do it

keep up taking that [ __ ] poison in

your veins

hear me [ __ ] you die for your [ __ ]

vaccines then

1343.919 --> 1348.48

you

1371.919 --> 1375.3600000000001

slow

1375.36 --> 1380.7199999999998
death that's what they are that's how i

1378.64 --> 1383.3600000000001
classify them

1380.72 --> 1386.24
and that is how i will legally pursue

1383.36 --> 1390.0
any involvement that is forced on me

1386.24 --> 1393.36
with that to the individual

1390.0 --> 1396.48
that actually tries to force that on me

1393.36 --> 1402.55
i will sue them for assault with a

deadly weapon

1410.64 --> 1416.24
i don't know earth passenger

1413.84 --> 1419.039
are you sure that planets don't twinkle

1416.24 --> 1419.039
i don't know man

1419.84 --> 1423.039
but yeah the twinkling to me always

1421.76 --> 1425.52
seems like it is

1423.039 --> 1426.64
sort of like a holographic side effect

1425.52 --> 1429.52
like

1426.64 --> 1430.0800000000002
even the star light for each eye maybe

1429.52 --> 1433.6
slightly

1430.08 --> 1434.559
out of phase because it's such a narrow

1433.6 --> 1436.48
point

1434.559 --> 1437.9189999999999
that already your eyes being slightly

1436.48 --> 1441.039
apart causes a

1437.919 --> 1441.039
a this phasing

1441.76 --> 1446.64
that that would be my angle of approach

1445.44 --> 1448.72
to try and figure out

1446.64 --> 1451.5200000000002
why stars twinkle because of yeah

1448.72 --> 1451.52
holographics

1451.6 --> 1459.039
and planets are obviously have a higher

1454.799 --> 1463.76
yeah higher angular size

1459.039 --> 1473.84
so then that phasing would be less

1463.76 --> 1473.84
does that make any sense

1474.48 --> 1477.2
oh man

1484.84 --> 1491.039
yep yeah but more colored

1487.44 --> 1493.039
look if people are so slavish

1491.039 --> 1495.2
mentally that they will literally

1493.039 --> 1497.679
surrender to slow death for no good

1495.2 --> 1500.799
reason just to get along

1497.679 --> 1502.96
then i don't want their genetics to be

1500.799 --> 1505.279
part of the country anymore so they can

1502.96 --> 1506.96
literally sterilize and kill themselves

1505.279 --> 1510.64
as far as i go because they're too

1506.96 --> 1513.76
mentally weak to defend themselves

1510.64 --> 1516.0800000000002
right but

1513.76 --> 1517.44
they're gonna mandate it that's a

1516.08 --> 1520.24
different thing then they're

1517.44 --> 1523.1200000000001
actually assaulting people that will not

1520.24 --> 1529.78
be slavish to that

1523.12 --> 1532.9299999999998
so that's the big difference

1529.78 --> 1532.93
[Music]

1540.84 --> 1543.84
ugh

1554.84 --> 1558.8799999999999
uh

1556.24 --> 1559.6
right yeah and when you blindly trust

1558.88 --> 1562.3200000000002
man

1559.6 --> 1564.24
you blindly trust every mom because

1562.32 --> 1567.039
those will slip in

1564.24 --> 1569.52
when you give your life authority

1567.039 --> 1572.559
intellectually over to somebody else

1569.52 --> 1574.08
then that power will on average

1572.559 --> 1577.76
statistically inevitably

1574.08 --> 1582.24
result in a power imbalance an ego

1577.76 --> 1582.24
causing them to basically

1582.64 --> 1589.679
start deciding for you because you don't

1587.52 --> 1590.559
when you are effectively going to die if

1589.679 --> 1593.52
you are worth

1590.559 --> 1595.44
maintaining for some long-term reason or

1593.52 --> 1598.24
if your family is supposed to

1595.44 --> 1599.8400000000001
die out because you're too weak that's

1598.24 --> 1601.76
what happens

1599.84 --> 1605.1999999999998
when you give your medical authority

1601.76 --> 1608.48
over to other people blindly

1605.2 --> 1608.88
they will end up eventually deciding on

1608.48 --> 1613.84
your

1608.88 --> 1613.8400000000001
death do you get it

1628.24 --> 1641.84
all right

1652.84 --> 1655.84
man

1659.919 --> 1663.279
see many parents back for the facts

1662.08 --> 1668.08
already oh oh good

1663.279 --> 1671.44
oh die then die you want the vaccine

1668.08 --> 1675.76
die do it

1671.44 --> 1678.96
do your delusional slow suicide then

1675.76 --> 1679.76
yeah do it on your children so they can

1678.96 --> 1682.72
eventually

1679.76 --> 1683.6
find out that your stupidity has

1682.72 --> 1686.96
basically

1683.6 --> 1689.6789999999999
killed their family chances in the

1686.96 --> 1691.52
future once they wake up it's all a scam

1689.679 --> 1693.279
yeah you know what they're gonna do to

1691.52 --> 1696.0
you your own kids your

1693.279 --> 1698.08
[ __ ] scumbags you know what they're

1696.0 --> 1699.919
gonna do to you

1699.919 --> 1703.679
[ __ ] pillow when you're old

1702.48 --> 1706.32
yeah that's what they're gonna do

1826.32 --> 1831.6789999999999
my blood flow

1827.76 --> 1831.679
a lot harder it's like sport

1834.84 --> 1837.9189999999999
effectively

1836.24 --> 1840.72
but i'm gonna get a headache if this

1837.919 --> 1843.2
keeps up for too long

1840.72 --> 1846.799
all that loudness is is basically

1843.2 --> 1846.799
numbing my brain eventually

1847.039 --> 1865.84
hey thank you samson for the 99 cent

1849.84 --> 1865.84
super chat donation

1876.84 --> 1892.48

oh nope

1892.48 --> 1898.24
hey brandon oh did i have a five

1895.679 --> 1899.0800000000002
dollar super chat where i missed oh yeah

1898.24 --> 1902.559
yeah

1899.08 --> 1904.559
expand d o mind 13.

1902.559 --> 1906.399
five dollars thank you very much i like

1904.559 --> 1909.76
your passion

1906.399 --> 1909.76
regarding the vaccines

1910.0 --> 1914.399
right well you know the weird thing is i

1912.88 --> 1918.24
originally started out like

1914.399 --> 1921.039
yeah yeah yeah theoretically in certain

1918.24 --> 1922.559
situations it might actually sort of

1921.039 --> 1926.12
work

1922.559 --> 1928.08
thing is though that the current vaccine

1926.12 --> 1931.36
megacorporations

1928.08 --> 1936.799
don't really even apply

1931.36 --> 1936.799
the system that originally

1937.12 --> 1942.2399999999998
constructed this this medical procedure

1940.88 --> 1945.679
as it were

1942.24 --> 1947.919
so they're not even doing it right

1945.679 --> 1950.3200000000002
it's literally just injecting a whole

1947.919 --> 1953.039
bunch of poison in people

1950.32 --> 1955.6
and and even now with this freaking

1953.039 --> 1957.84
protein nano modification and all that

1955.6 --> 1959.36
it's like what the hell does that even

1957.84 --> 1963.039
have to do

1959.36 --> 1965.1999999999998
with vaccine theory

1963.039 --> 1966.96
it's preposterous it has nothing to do

1965.2 --> 1970.32
with it anymore so

1966.96 --> 1973.519
to even call it a vaccine is

1970.32 --> 1977.2
technically false

1973.519 --> 1981.919
it well

1977.2 --> 1981.919
right uh it's not

1982.159 --> 1986.88
a vaccination against the disease

1984.64 --> 1990.0
according to the original

1986.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
system it's just junk

1990.0 --> 1993.44
being injected directly into your

1991.84 --> 1996.48
bloodstream

1993.44 --> 1997.679
that's what it is now has nothing to do

1996.48 --> 2005.84
with the original

1997.679 --> 2005.8400000000001
concept of vaccines even

2013.279 --> 2020.0
jesus oh my god

2016.84 --> 2025.6789999999999
samson oh my god

2020.0 --> 2025.679
what a horrific story oh my god

2026.96 --> 2033.8400000000001
i'm so sorry to hear that man that's

2030.84 --> 2033.84
horrific

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2051.44 --> 2055.04
you're almost making me a little

2052.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
emotional here my god i can't even

2055.04 --> 2061.839
imagine it

2090.24 --> 2094.72
right right

2095.52 --> 2101.92
i hope you i don't know

2099.599 --> 2103.92
i by the way i have no idea how old you

2101.92 --> 2105.92
are

2103.92 --> 2107.119
otherwise i'd say yeah well maybe you

2105.92 --> 2109.76
could find a new wife

2107.119 --> 2112.2400000000002
i don't know if you're even yeah you

2109.76 --> 2113.76
know it sometimes it's such a huge shock

2112.24 --> 2116.72
especially if you've been together for

2113.76 --> 2118.6400000000003
very long there's just no

2116.72 --> 2120.48
you don't have any room for anybody else

2118.64 --> 2124.4
after that point i i

2120.48 --> 2126.48
i'm julie old oh my god right

2124.4 --> 2128.32
like i've even had that sort of with my

2126.48 --> 2130.0
ex-girlfriend and i've only been with

2128.32 --> 2132.2400000000002
her for three years and just

2130.0 --> 2134.4
just breaking up was so devastating i

2132.24 --> 2134.3999999999996
just

2134.56 --> 2138.96
didn't want it anymore

2140.56 --> 2148.0789999999997
right 50 years

2144.4 --> 2148.8
all right well maybe you could find some

2148.079 --> 2152.079
comfort

2148.8 --> 2156.7200000000003
in my story at it and that is well

2152.079 --> 2160.0
my mother died in 2006

2156.72 --> 2164.16
right after my dad divorced or well no

2160.0 --> 2164.16
my dad divorced my mom in 2001

2165.2 --> 2170.72
but yeah they were married for like what

2168.16 --> 2170.72
is it again

2171.2 --> 2180.64
30 years or something really really long

2175.76 --> 2184.32
and my dad has a new wife

2180.64 --> 2188.72
you know and he's now almost like 70

2184.32 --> 2191.599
but he's had you yeah just somebody else

2188.72 --> 2194.24
and yeah they are really good partners

2191.599 --> 2196.7200000000003
so it's never too late

2194.24 --> 2197.52
but yeah you still need some time to get

2196.72 --> 2199.1189999999997
over it

2197.52 --> 2202.48
and just need to take your time with

2199.119 --> 2202.48
that so did my dad

2206.96 --> 2210.88
so i hope you'll be all right it's a

2208.8 --> 2215.8390000000004
pretty

2210.88 --> 2215.839
heavy story

2234.56 --> 2240.24
oh it's kind of being a loner right

2237.76 --> 2241.119
but hey loners need partners too you

2240.24 --> 2243.68
know

2241.119 --> 2244.56
really they just need one that

2243.68 --> 2247.44
understands

2244.56 --> 2247.44
that you're a loaner

2247.599 --> 2251.52
because loners i myself is a loner i

2250.64 --> 2254.72
just know

2251.52 --> 2256.72
i need solo time

2254.72 --> 2258.72
like when i'm just not surrounded by

2256.72 --> 2259.359
people i really need that if i don't get

2258.72 --> 2262.72
it i'll

2259.359 --> 2264.7999999999997
go crazy so

2262.72 --> 2271.839
you just need to find somebody that gets

2264.8 --> 2271.8390000000004
that and then it's great

2282.839 --> 2285.839
uh

2293.28 --> 2297.52
all right well if you really trust this

2296.32 --> 2299.76
community

2297.52 --> 2302.32
like to remind you that you should first

2299.76 --> 2305.2000000000003
and foremost trust yourself

2302.32 --> 2305.2000000000003
very important

2306.079 --> 2310.48
because there is some weird stuff

2310.839 --> 2314.96
happening there is

2315.04 --> 2320.8
i don't know what it is but i've been

2318.079 --> 2323.6800000000003
catching signs and this is from the

2320.8 --> 2327.6800000000003
wider community

2323.68 --> 2330.7999999999997
that there are there's some things wrong

2327.68 --> 2333.04
there's people that have

2330.8 --> 2333.04
like

2335.68 --> 2340.0
oddities to them that they don't seem to

2339.359 --> 2343.5989999999997
be willing

2340.0 --> 2346.8
to correct and that will

2343.599 --> 2347.119
in my estimation eventually cause them

2346.8 --> 2350.2400000000002
to

2347.119 --> 2352.88
end up pretty much doing the same thing

2350.24 --> 2355.1189999999997
as the new world order does

2352.88 --> 2357.28
now that seems extremely remote it's

2355.119 --> 2360.7200000000003
just that

2357.28 --> 2361.599
there are some weird people among flat

2360.72 --> 2364.0
earth as well

2361.599 --> 2364.96
and shouldn't surprise anyone because

2364.0 --> 2368.72
yeah a lot of this

2364.96 --> 2372.079
is media and there's a lot of really

2368.72 --> 2374.48
freaky people in media and so

2372.079 --> 2376.48
if you hang around on media it's

2374.48 --> 2383.839
inevitable that you will

2376.48 --> 2383.839
bump into these sort of people

2384.0 --> 2391.119
and we in this time period

2387.04 --> 2394.839
should not be tolerant

2391.119 --> 2400.1600000000003
of people with extreme aberrant

2394.839 --> 2403.04
behavior and criminal records

2400.16 --> 2404.24
yet there are people that are also

2403.04 --> 2406.319
forgiving so

2404.24 --> 2407.9199999999996
tolerant that they just seem to be like

2406.319 --> 2409.04
oh it doesn't matter it's all okay

2407.92 --> 2412.079
because they're flattered

2409.04 --> 2413.2
i'm gonna trust that yeah that's gonna

2412.079 --> 2417.52
get everyone in

2413.2 --> 2419.4399999999996
big big trouble

2417.52 --> 2421.52
i'm not even gonna name names you're

2419.44 --> 2423.92
gonna have to figure that one out

2421.52 --> 2425.599
because i don't like to spread that sort

2423.92 --> 2429.839
of thing but there's just

2425.599 --> 2431.44
it's not all all right not everything

2429.839 --> 2433.04
you know them by their deeds you know

2431.44 --> 2434.96
them by their character you know them by

2433.04 --> 2437.92
their records

2434.96 --> 2439.839
but don't just think that all flat

2437.92 --> 2442.88
earthers are cool because they are

2439.839 --> 2445.04
flat earthers be very careful there are

2442.88 --> 2448.56
some

2445.04 --> 2451.2
weirdos there too not just

2448.56 --> 2454.56
dumber people or but just people that

2451.2 --> 2458.48
have aberrant behavior

2454.56 --> 2461.04
that will over time

2458.48 --> 2462.4
risk more and more losing their humanity

2461.04 --> 2466.319
and then they will be

2462.4 --> 2469.44
moles among us to actually pollute

2466.319 --> 2471.04
the cohesion and the purity of the

2469.44 --> 2473.76
spirit of the movement

2471.04 --> 2475.04
you have to understand this don't let it

2473.76 --> 2478.8390000000004
slide

2475.04 --> 2481.599
don't tolerate people that let it slide

2478.839 --> 2483.7599999999998
morally and intellectually don't

2481.599 --> 2486.1600000000003
tolerate it

2483.76 --> 2487.76
do not tolerate this from flat earthers

2486.16 --> 2492.0789999999997
they cannot let it slide

2487.76 --> 2496.0
and they cannot mar they cannot morally

2492.079 --> 2496.96
water things down i will not tolerate

2496.0 --> 2498.8
this

2496.96 --> 2501.68
i will be less tolerant of this i

2498.8 --> 2505.119
already pretty much don't i stay away

2501.68 --> 2507.68
but if i'm gonna see worse

2505.119 --> 2508.88
worse traits popping up then i will

2507.68 --> 2512.0
start to literally

2508.88 --> 2514.7200000000003
mark up people and then report on them

2512.0 --> 2515.68
to the entire community tell and also

2514.72 --> 2517.839
address them

2515.68 --> 2519.7599999999998
like yeah you're doing this and this oh

2517.839 --> 2521.839
you think that's okay do you

2519.76 --> 2523.599
you think it's okay you're free you're

2521.839 --> 2525.2
free to do whatever the [ __ ] you want

2523.599 --> 2529.04
despite everything

2525.2 --> 2531.2799999999997
well guess what no no you're not

2529.04 --> 2532.4
you have a moral and spiritual

2531.28 --> 2536.6400000000003
obligation

2532.4 --> 2538.079
in this giant spiritual war you cannot

2536.64 --> 2540.7999999999997
let it slide

2538.079 --> 2542.4
you cannot or you will be a detriment to

2540.8 --> 2546.1600000000003
all of us

2542.4 --> 2550.1600000000003
you cannot do this and i will not

2546.16 --> 2551.52
stand for it and you know who you are

2550.16 --> 2554.7999999999997
and if you don't

2551.52 --> 2557.7599999999998
i will shake you up until you do know

2554.8 --> 2559.44
eventually and i'm not talking about

2557.76 --> 2560.5600000000004
people in my chat here i'm talking

2559.44 --> 2565.839
actually about

2560.56 --> 2565.839
regular youtubers as well

2567.359 --> 2574.4
do not let it slide

2571.2 --> 2576.48
you do not have that luxury you may get

2574.4 --> 2577.44
the impression that you do and it's all

2576.48 --> 2580.88
free

2577.44 --> 2583.599
it's not you are going to pay the price

2580.88 --> 2583.92
not because we are going to punish you

2583.599 --> 2587.52
but

2583.92 --> 2588.48
because it is not free and it will have

2587.52 --> 2591.28
consequences

2588.48 --> 2593.839
and you will pay the price for that

2591.28 --> 2593.8390000000004
naturally

2595.52 --> 2599.359
this is not the time to let it slide

2600.96 --> 2604.32
[Music]

2605.04 --> 2611.92
we are not here to gain ground with the

2608.16 --> 2613.5989999999997
amoral masses and try to wreak them up

2611.92 --> 2617.2000000000003
to get higher viewers

2613.599 --> 2620.8
in a broader panel right for more

2617.2 --> 2624.0
money or fame or whatever

2620.8 --> 2627.28
yeah letting it slide just to do that

2624.0 --> 2627.92
is wrong it's not just wrong it'll make

2627.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
you a

2627.92 --> 2635.839
problem to us don't do it

2652.0 --> 2663.839
god i look annoying when i'm pissed off

2665.01 --> 2668.0890000000004
[Music]

2676.64 --> 2680.319
hey julio pavin good to see you

2685.04 --> 2688.72
you missed the super chat what again oh

2688.0 --> 2691.599

2688.72 --> 2695.52
keep overlooking them damn it yeah thank

2691.599 --> 2697.44
you colin dresser for the 99.99

2695.52 --> 2699.52
dollar super chat donation our win is

2697.44 --> 2699.92
ace make it a great day i will do my

2699.52 --> 2701.44
best

2699.92 --> 2704.16
although i get the feeling it's going to

2701.44 --> 2706.43
be a very

2704.16 --> 2709.5699999999997
loud day

2706.43 --> 2709.5699999999997
[Music]

2709.599 --> 2719.839
it already kind of is

2729.76 --> 2733.8390000000004
right yeah i do my best calling dresser

2731.76 --> 2733.8390000000004
but

2735.92 --> 2741.839
maybe i just needed to get enough of my

2738.4 --> 2741.839
chest and out in the world

2742.48 --> 2748.16
you know it's weird because i just need

2746.16 --> 2750.48
people to know that i'm taking all of

2748.16 --> 2752.48
this very serious and that i'm not going

2750.48 --> 2753.92
to spiritually let them get away it's

2752.48 --> 2755.839
not like i'm

2753.92 --> 2758.319
like oh you do this then immediately

2755.839 --> 2760.0
this plan unrolls and i'm gonna go these

2758.319 --> 2763.2799999999997
places and meet people and do

2760.0 --> 2765.68
these physical actions no well my spirit

2763.28 --> 2768.7200000000003
does a lot

2765.68 --> 2774.96
and i know i'm being heard much broader

2768.72 --> 2777.4399999999996
than i can even imagine i feel sometimes

2774.96 --> 2778.8
like my show is part on the spiritual

2777.44 --> 2780.48
internet too

2778.8 --> 2783.079
not just the regular one that the

2780.48 --> 2785.68
regular one is completely

2783.079 --> 2787.52
encapsulated made to have a small

2785.68 --> 2788.48
audience but i just sometimes feel that

2787.52 --> 2790.8
there is

2788.48 --> 2791.68
another like in the dark world the

2790.8 --> 2794.1600000000003
internet

2791.68 --> 2797.04
is paying very much attention to every

2794.16 --> 2802.72
[ __ ] thing i say

2797.04 --> 2806.16
sounds really weird doesn't it

2802.72 --> 2811.52
i just noticed i noticed that things

2806.16 --> 2813.68
respond to me like very broadly

2811.52 --> 2814.96
even in the choice of words in the

2813.68 --> 2820.319
vernacular like

2814.96 --> 2820.319
it's too uncanny too uncanny

2820.48 --> 2825.28
it's beyond synchronicity you know

2822.88 --> 2827.359
synchronicity is like when a thing pops

2825.28 --> 2830.2400000000002
up and then

2827.359 --> 2832.24
just that moment another thing exactly

2830.24 --> 2833.5989999999997
like that pops up no no with me it's not

2832.24 --> 2836.68
like that anymore

2833.599 --> 2837.92
it's a giant fractal pattern of

2836.68 --> 2841.44
synchronicities

2837.92 --> 2844.88
everywhere everything it's one thing

2841.44 --> 2846.64
almost it's all becoming one thing to me

2844.88 --> 2848.4
that's what it seems like more and more

2846.64 --> 2852.7999999999997
it's no more synchronicity it's

2848.4 --> 2852.8
one giant synchronicity all of it

2855.04 --> 2862.319
giant fractal pattern of yeah

2858.559 --> 2862.3190000000004
of information parallels

2868.4 --> 2873.839
yeah and as a side effect i get extra

2870.48 --> 2873.839
pissed off

2875.599 --> 2879.44
because that is also an unfortunate side

2877.76 --> 2883.3590000000004
effect the more

2879.44 --> 2883.359
oversight i seem to get

2883.599 --> 2887.6800000000003
the more i realize how little i can do

2886.079 --> 2890.319
about it

2887.68 --> 2891.1189999999997
from a physical standpoint and that

2890.319 --> 2894.64
brings in

2891.119 --> 2897.319
huge frustration and my

2894.64 --> 2899.68
earthly spirit seems to be trying to

2897.319 --> 2900.96
overcompensate like okay it's that big a

2899.68 --> 2903.44
danger that means

2900.96 --> 2904.559
you are literally now training for a

2903.44 --> 2907.28
brutal

2904.559 --> 2909.44
war that's what it feels like for my

2907.28 --> 2911.3590000000004
body sometimes

2909.44 --> 2913.04
like i'm literally in the middle of a

2911.359 --> 2917.68
world war and i'm going to be

2913.04 --> 2917.68
sent to the bloody front any second now

2922.24 --> 2925.2799999999997
even though mentally i know it's

2924.0 --> 2927.28
different

2925.28 --> 2929.2000000000003
it's just i have a body spirit and i

2927.28 --> 2943.8390000000004
have my mind

2929.2 --> 2943.839
and they are different

2946.24 --> 2949.7599999999998
all right yeah investigate this flat

2948.64 --> 2953.359

girlfriend is in the army

2993.2 --> 2999.839

3000.88 --> 3005.04

yeah drunken bullet eric who

3057.52 --> 3064.559
well you can't you can't handle

3061.119 --> 3068.1600000000003
my truth eric dube

3064.559 --> 3073.0400000000004
that guy

3068.16 --> 3077.04
the guy who literally originated

3073.04 --> 3082.0
the safari syndrome

3077.04 --> 3085.68
that eric dubay

3082.0 --> 3085.68
as own benjamin as described

3087.359 --> 3089.5989999999997
right

3093.119 --> 3096.6400000000003
and they despite that i will give credit

3095.68 --> 3100.24
where credit is due

3096.64 --> 3104.48
eric has made some really good videos

3100.24 --> 3108.0
on flat earth he's a good narrator

3104.48 --> 3108.0
so i'm not going to diss him on that

3108.24 --> 3112.16
as for everything else that he does

3112.8 --> 3118.079
so fungi syndrome it is what well

3115.44 --> 3121.28
stefanie is like a secret king

3118.079 --> 3123.92
conspiracy theorist it's like i have the

3121.28 --> 3125.52
truth and nobody can handle it and that

3123.92 --> 3127.76
you're literally gonna bother

3125.52 --> 3129.44
just normies and then tell them oh you

3127.76 --> 3130.48
don't know the truth you can't handle

3129.44 --> 3133.76
the truth

3130.48 --> 3136.96
i know it all you must follow me or

3133.76 --> 3138.88
like that that's savagne

3136.96 --> 3140.319
people who get very pushy and

3138.88 --> 3142.559
manipulative with

3140.319 --> 3143.7599999999998
being a truther and then think that they

3142.559 --> 3147.19
are the secret king

3143.76 --> 3148.96
of it all that

3147.19 --> 3151.52
[Music]

3148.96 --> 3153.119
and yeah eric the bay has had at least a

3151.52 --> 3156.319
lot of followers that are

3153.119 --> 3156.319
very much like that

3156.58 --> 3161.769
[Music]

3164.64 --> 3171.7599999999998
what's the best fe channel to watch well

3168.24 --> 3175.2799999999997
arwin arwin channel

3171.76 --> 3176.4
and flat earth debates and also because

3175.28 --> 3178.96
the flat earth debates

3176.4 --> 3179.44
is a really good nexus point to find

3178.96 --> 3182.559
other

3179.44 --> 3185.44
good technical channels

3182.559 --> 3187.0400000000004
nathan is always looking around for

3185.44 --> 3190.7200000000003
people that make

3187.04 --> 3192.5589999999997
good technical videos

3190.72 --> 3195.1189999999997
so following the flat earth debates

3192.559 --> 3195.8390000000004
nathan oakley 1980 which i am going to

3195.119 --> 3197.119
join in

3195.839 --> 3198.96
any minute now because i'm going to

3197.119 --> 3202.1600000000003
round out the show

3198.96 --> 3204.7200000000003
nathan oakley 1980

3202.16 --> 3207.359
yeah quantum eraser but yeah that's a

3204.72 --> 3211.68
little bit more advanced

3207.359 --> 3214.16
it's very dry in ways

3211.68 --> 3216.24
it's like it's more academic when you go

3214.16 --> 3218.7999999999997
to quantum eraser if you can handle that

3216.24 --> 3220.319
i'd start with flat earth debates first

3218.8 --> 3223.2000000000003
because then you get confronted with the

3220.319 --> 3225.359
basics the housekeeping questions

3223.2 --> 3227.2799999999997
and once you get used to that and get

3225.359 --> 3230.24
used to the baller zealots

3227.28 --> 3232.7200000000003
that phenomena the scene then it's a

3230.24 --> 3235.1189999999997
good place from to move on from there

3232.72 --> 3236.0
to yeah people like quantum eraser and

3235.119 --> 3238.88
others

3236.0 --> 3238.88
yeah youtubers

3239.52 --> 3243.2
so that's what i would recommend

3244.0 --> 3247.28
right but i am going to round out the

3246.079 --> 3249.6800000000003
