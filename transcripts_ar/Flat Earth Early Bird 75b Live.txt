4.22 --> 14.428999999999998
good afternoon welcome to Flat Earth

8.28 --> 17.759999999999998
early-bird number 75 be second part for

14.429 --> 21.42
reals this time a bit of a test run

17.76 --> 24.740000000000002
earlier but that yeah that didn't work

21.42 --> 29.880000000000003
out so I'm doing redoing it now

24.74 --> 32.699999999999996
hello guys Steve John Watson I see you

29.88 --> 36.12
got the notification good I'll

32.7 --> 45.510000000000005
completely open to guests it's for a

36.12 --> 49.82899999999999
subject lift heavy stuff i i've actually

45.51 --> 55.059
now been watching the me tim hang out

49.829 --> 61.64
where he reported about the hole

55.059 --> 64.369
poncho Pete situation and that hit

61.64 --> 67.34
pretty hard because it was really out

64.369 --> 72.58
there and he opened the raw feelings

67.34 --> 76.19
were there and I think that Tim is an

72.58 --> 80.57
insidious sick bastard for what he's

76.19 --> 86.09
doing being like a dry marxist

80.57 --> 92.32
politician just completely abusing what

86.09 --> 94.58
this to spur witch-hunt behavior

92.32 --> 98.3
polarization like nothing else out there

94.58 --> 100.22
it is so shameless so evil what he's

98.3 --> 107.75
done with this because I watched it and

100.22 --> 110.99
yeah let me be blatant let me be very

107.75 --> 115.909
direct yeah he went out of hand he lost

110.99 --> 119.78
control but my god why how what was

115.909 --> 123.97900000000001
actually going on there well apparently

119.78 --> 127.34
he had a guy over was it wasn't Jessa

123.979 --> 130.759
Conda or something I don't know doesn't

127.34 --> 135.62
really matter but he like was a slow guy

130.759 --> 140.72
and yeah Pete just got really sick of

135.62 --> 143.0
something he got hit in a you know he is

140.72 --> 144.95
a sensitive guy and he doesn't respond

143.0 --> 145.34
he's not very disciplined for that kind

144.95 --> 148.819
of [ __ ]

145.34 --> 150.68
but he does do crazy stuff like invite

148.819 --> 152.39
people over for a long periods of time

150.68 --> 157.06900000000002
even though he should know better and do

152.39 --> 159.76
that and just went eh he just like

157.069 --> 165.56
thought get the hell out of my space and

159.76 --> 167.92999999999998
the guy started back talking like there

165.56 --> 168.68
was a flat earth argument going and my

167.93 --> 172.06900000000002
god

168.68 --> 174.98000000000002
you can't do that he was physically

172.069 --> 176.98899999999998
present in the guy's house and when you

174.98 --> 180.349
have that kind of response

176.989 --> 182.469
then you must obey as an outsider as a

180.349 --> 185.76999999999998
guest if you don't you're in

182.469 --> 188.93
that's natural law

185.77 --> 193.46
you got a leave and then ya punch of

188.93 --> 196.16
peat went apeshit and I don't get why

193.46 --> 197.84
the other guy just didn't turn around

196.16 --> 201.85999999999999
and get the hell out of there

197.84 --> 205.34
immediately running like what kind of a

201.86 --> 208.31
weirdo drugged-out zombie are you if you

205.34 --> 211.21
just don't respond to a situation like

208.31 --> 214.19
that and poncho Pete went way too far

211.21 --> 215.78
it's still not very clear what happened

214.19 --> 218.72
he may have used like a knife or

215.78 --> 223.61
something it yeah that's stupid

218.72 --> 226.07
but oh my god it's not what it's

223.61 --> 227.06
portrayed to be and he's gonna be in big

226.07 --> 229.94
trouble now

227.06 --> 232.31
real big trouble from multiple angles

229.94 --> 234.65
because he is kind of unstable and he

232.31 --> 239.72
was totally irresponsible doing this in

234.65 --> 241.94
front of siblings that's gonna hit him

239.72 --> 243.68
hard and I'm talking now to flat

241.94 --> 248.35999999999999
earthers here and I hope this spreads

243.68 --> 251.269
wide because poncho Pete he is gonna

248.36 --> 253.04000000000002
have a serious problem now with the

251.269 --> 255.05
government and there's a big likelihood

253.04 --> 259.43
they're gonna institutionalize him and

255.05 --> 264.26
force him to basically drop flat earth

259.43 --> 267.1
and it might have all kinds of results

264.26 --> 272.419
like he could go on medication and just

267.1 --> 275.84000000000003
be dosed out and or he could become

272.419 --> 278.78
suicidal because what he deals with is

275.84 --> 280.54999999999995
kind of the same [ __ ] what I'm talking

278.78 --> 283.52
about the spiritual but he seems

280.55 --> 287.78000000000003
completely incapable of properly dealing

283.52 --> 290.99
with all this pressure and he doesn't

287.78 --> 293.96
know how to get rid of the demon

290.99 --> 298.46000000000004
it's literally what he was shouting and

293.96 --> 302.06
in a way he was kind of right but that's

298.46 --> 306.44
not the way to deal with it that's look

302.06 --> 308.419
the recipient of the demon has no idea

306.44 --> 309.8
what's going on they never do never

308.419 --> 312.5
really that's the hole in their

309.8 --> 315.259
conscience and if you attack that then

312.5 --> 320.75
the dark side gets exactly what it wants

315.259 --> 323.509
gets your rage it's so foolish but yeah

320.75 --> 325.61
you know the person can only take so

323.509 --> 326.96000000000004
much pressure and I think people just

325.61 --> 329.0
can't take that much pressure

326.96 --> 333.169
unfortunately it's very sad for him and

329.0 --> 335.63
he's gonna be in a very torn up position

333.169 --> 337.599
probably in the near future so anyone

335.63 --> 340.729
that still has any contact with him

337.599 --> 344.03
please be careful and if he suddenly

340.729 --> 346.61
starts out yeah I'm a global now please

344.03 --> 352.88
please this is me personally please

346.61 --> 355.28000000000003
don't push him cuz yeah if if you're

352.88 --> 358.82
gonna push him about that in such a

355.28 --> 362.38899999999995
situation when he basically could lose

358.82 --> 364.479
risk everything all that [ __ ] I don't

362.389 --> 364.479
know

366.53 --> 370.64
it's dangerous makes me think about Jose

369.17 --> 374.15000000000003
as well you know we don't really know

370.64 --> 376.37
what went on with that he never really

374.15 --> 380.33
elaborated on that back sitting home

376.37 --> 382.07
situation so now I'm thinking like did

380.33 --> 386.99
something go wrong there did he go

382.07 --> 389.42
apeshit to be forced back because yeah

386.99 --> 392.09000000000003
when especially when violence is

389.42 --> 394.43
concerned in the psychiatric manual flat

392.09 --> 397.09999999999997
earth is considered a mental disorder

394.43 --> 403.40000000000003
and when you combine that with violence

397.1 --> 405.47
then it's very easy to yeah subconscious

403.4 --> 408.40999999999997
even not even knowing what actually is

405.47 --> 412.13000000000005
the truth or anything force a framework

408.41 --> 415.88000000000005
to get yet to do for somebody back on

412.13 --> 419.69
the globe basically it's very inherent

415.88 --> 421.78
to the system very evil very yeah we're

419.69 --> 427.94
powerless against it the only way to

421.78 --> 428.919
defend against it is to keep control you

427.94 --> 433.87
know

428.919 --> 433.87
it's creepy [ __ ] so please

434.49 --> 439.95
let's be very careful with bunch of

437.19 --> 443.28
people from now on and just screw the

439.95 --> 445.62
Glovers don't they make gloat over all

443.28 --> 449.15999999999997
that [ __ ] they may make them they're

445.62 --> 453.39
freaking Christ like oh my god see you

449.16 --> 456.18
know I literally do that as a sadistic

453.39 --> 458.4
trick they may do that if he turns to

456.18 --> 462.66
the globe but it's not freakin Pete's

458.4 --> 466.52
fault he's just that doesn't mean that

462.66 --> 468.90000000000003
if he goes totally insane and like

466.52 --> 473.12
violently the other way that we should

468.9 --> 475.34999999999997
not defend against that of course but

473.12 --> 477.39
man this is just such a tragedy

475.35 --> 480.15000000000003
happening right there it's like the

477.39 --> 483.71999999999997
darkness getting a foothold and it

480.15 --> 487.21999999999997
saddens me greatly and it hurts me as I

483.72 --> 487.22
felt it happened there

488.49 --> 496.09000000000003
and just did

490.84 --> 500.46
these guys it's just so disgusting but

496.09 --> 504.78999999999996
you do that [ __ ] it's so disgusting

500.46 --> 511.0
it's beyond Malthusian it is literally

504.79 --> 515.169
like Lucifer personified total total

511.0 --> 518.8
political abuse to the maximum it is so

515.169 --> 521.02
evil to do what he did in that video and

518.8 --> 522.6999999999999
draw comparisons to all flat earth and

521.02 --> 525.28
to me yeah

522.7 --> 529.6600000000001
because I sometimes get passionate oh my

525.28 --> 533.41
god I'm the same yeah yeah thanks thanks

529.66 --> 536.26
for that ass I'm not the same like that

533.41 --> 539.89
yeah okay I will defend myself if

536.26 --> 542.77
somebody attacks me it will never cause

539.89 --> 548.14
physical harm to anyone that does not

542.77 --> 550.0889999999999
engage first ever or obviously like if

548.14 --> 553.24
they're freaking storming my house with

550.089 --> 556.3000000000001
a gun or a knife or whatever then yeah I

553.24 --> 557.339
will try to preemptively do something

556.3 --> 563.3599999999999
about it

557.339 --> 568.3100000000001
but yeah I will never start fight

563.36 --> 569.99
maybe a brawl but only yeah not if I'm

568.31 --> 571.6999999999999
gonna end up hurting them because I can

569.99 --> 575.42
size other people up now if I'm not a

571.7 --> 577.76
really big guy so usually in a brawl

575.42 --> 585.55
nobody's really gonna get hurt maybe me

577.76 --> 585.55
if I'm not careful but come on

593.78 --> 604.61
so it's just that sickening abuse it is

598.57 --> 609.4100000000001
it is like the CNN essence that level of

604.61 --> 617.75
just pure concentrated evil form it lies

609.41 --> 620.51
and deceit and polarization disrupting

617.75 --> 625.54
peace been disrupting the energy of

620.51 --> 625.54
peace it is so sick to do that

640.22 --> 645.2
anyway I see a lot of other people chat

643.37 --> 647.59

645.2 --> 652.25

moon I guess I can't see the rest let's

807.46 --> 815.64
see yeah why can't you go to the mood or

813.58 --> 820.5400000000001
what what happen

815.64 --> 821.38
that's the Larry's I'll have to check it

820.54 --> 824.399
out later

821.38 --> 824.399
[Music]

831.33 --> 836.44
yeah Archana a noob I know

834.31 --> 838.4499999999999
bunch of Pete the man is obviously not

836.44 --> 841.6600000000001
well that's why I addressed the

838.45 --> 845.2
situation to clarify that instead of

841.66 --> 847.81
just marking him down oh he is an insane

845.2 --> 850.5400000000001
person which all the ballers love to do

847.81 --> 852.79
as soon as anyone does anything slightly

850.54 --> 855.61
out of the ordinary from their

852.79 --> 858.3399999999999
perspective I know but I do address the

855.61 --> 862.1800000000001
situation because I I felt touched by it

858.34 --> 865.36
and I feel concerned about the guy okay

862.18 --> 867.4899999999999
he has problems but there's always

865.36 --> 874.48
something about him that I did kind of

867.49 --> 876.61
like and yeah I can't help that I don't

874.48 --> 880.57
think he's a very trustworthy guy and

876.61 --> 883.84
he's not always been nice to me and he

880.57 --> 886.6600000000001
goes along with dark people dark

883.84 --> 890.14
intentions it's he is full of problems

886.66 --> 893.64
but yeah that doesn't mean that he

890.14 --> 899.11
deserves some kind of terrible fate okay

893.64 --> 901.38
it's just no I don't want to dehumanize

899.11 --> 901.38
him

904.13 --> 911.769
yeah indeed he has a family and this is

907.19 --> 911.769
just bad it's very dangerous

916.85 --> 920.3290000000001
so I guess yeah whether he liked it or

919.789 --> 924.079
not

920.329 --> 927.829
anyone out there if you can pray for him

924.079 --> 931.6389999999999
pray for him and his family that this

927.829 --> 933.9789999999999
hurt and also by the way the guy that

931.639 --> 935.389
was actually hurt because yeah in the

933.979 --> 937.999
end he really doesn't deserve that

935.389 --> 940.609
either no matter what kind of an ass he

937.999 --> 947.239
may have been pray for them pray for

940.609 --> 951.0790000000001
that situation to be healed push back

947.239 --> 954.7090000000001
the hurts don't be seduced by vengeance

951.079 --> 959.959
or opportunity just let it be healed

954.709 --> 962.209
and come to rest and hopefully a lesson

959.959 --> 966.41
can be learned from all sides and they

962.209 --> 970.4889999999999
can all become better for it but yeah

966.41 --> 973.129
they need our prayers basically your

970.489 --> 975.0600000000001
meditation your good focus their good

973.129 --> 978.65
wishes

975.06 --> 982.76
let's just hope yeah this thing doesn't

978.65 --> 982.76
grow anymore terrible

993.99 --> 1001.45
please

996.86 --> 1004.1800000000001
don't be so free for everyone for what's

1001.45 --> 1010.57
coming don't sit don't focus on some

1004.18 --> 1015.9699999999999
kind of doom okay it's the trick it's

1010.57 --> 1019.839
their trick every time you hold on to

1015.97 --> 1023.9200000000001
that you help them manifest that tension

1019.839 --> 1029.17
to make it happen to get to that point

1023.92 --> 1034.839
don't do it focus on peace don't focus

1029.17 --> 1040.42
on doom focus on peace how many times do

1034.839 --> 1044.8899999999999
I have to say this don't destroy your

1040.42 --> 1049.48
enemies don't enslave your enemies learn

1044.89 --> 1052.69
to understand them and then figure out a

1049.48 --> 1057.49
way to make them indispensable for you

1052.69 --> 1058.3500000000001
and preferably make that mutual in the

1057.49 --> 1063.429
process

1058.35 --> 1064.6599999999999
don't focus on doom and death there is

1063.429 --> 1069.929
no point

1064.66 --> 1069.929
not if we prevent that from happening

1072.9 --> 1079.1100000000001
and you don't have to be full of joy

1075.47 --> 1082.38
necessarily even like you know joy in a

1079.11 --> 1085.6499999999999
way can be a distraction as well but

1082.38 --> 1087.0300000000002
just not yet in another direction don't

1085.65 --> 1089.49
nudge it down

1087.03 --> 1097.29
no nudge it towards a breaking point

1089.49 --> 1099.68
just let it heal let it all heal all of

1097.29 --> 1099.68
it

1116.65 --> 1121.029
and that which cannot be healed cannot

1119.38 --> 1125.89
be healed but it'll show and I think

1121.029 --> 1131.26
that as some drop further in darkness

1125.89 --> 1134.1100000000001
and yeah fall in the abyss others that

1131.26 --> 1138.58
we thought could not be healed will heal

1134.11 --> 1141.1899999999998
I think there's much fewer actually

1138.58 --> 1143.62
going to the absolute depths of the

1141.19 --> 1148.15
abyss than we think

1143.62 --> 1150.1899999999998
I think that most are just being held

1148.15 --> 1155.3200000000002
together by that framework by the

1150.19 --> 1161.14
control framework and I think that if

1155.32 --> 1165.1
just the top break and fall that the

1161.14 --> 1168.159
rest will just wake up think like oh my

1165.1 --> 1171.309
god can we finally move on now from the

1168.159 --> 1173.529
[ __ ] because we already figured out

1171.309 --> 1177.4289999999999
years ago how to do this much much

1173.529 --> 1180.46
better much more sensible and net not

1177.429 --> 1184.0
get every freaking one to hate us you

1180.46 --> 1186.8500000000001
know they must be anxious to finally

1184.0 --> 1189.88
have that opportunity to stop this

1186.85 --> 1193.5
insanity that's what I feel and I think

1189.88 --> 1193.5
I'm probably not alone out there

1205.549 --> 1208.82
chocolate scene

1220.11 --> 1222.86
hmm

1225.33 --> 1233.61
that's funny thing you know a GM yeah

1229.35 --> 1241.379
little vision-related stuff there was

1233.61 --> 1243.2389999999998
this thing about 911 but the funny or I

1241.379 --> 1247.4599999999998
don't know the funny thing was at the

1243.239 --> 1251.009
time I did get like four looks but I

1247.46 --> 1252.21
didn't care it was like yeah this is

1251.009 --> 1255.8600000000001
gonna happen is gonna change everything

1252.21 --> 1260.999
I was just like this is stupid I'm not

1255.86 --> 1264.2389999999998
interested in that kind of [ __ ] and yeah

1260.999 --> 1267.869
I just skipped it then retrospect like

1264.239 --> 1271.95
oh yeah 911 mmm okay well yeah it's too

1267.869 --> 1273.84
late now and even if I had four yet

1271.95 --> 1274.82
spoke out about it probably wouldn't

1273.84 --> 1277.35
have worked anyway

1274.82 --> 1280.34
but they would probably have stopped me

1277.35 --> 1282.6
nipped me in the butt or something so

1280.34 --> 1285.33
yeah that was gonna happen and it

1282.6 --> 1288.98
happened and now we're still figuring

1285.33 --> 1288.98
out what the freakin hell happens

1303.84 --> 1309.59
so yeah if anyone's up for joining the

1307.17 --> 1309.5900000000001
panel

1312.44 --> 1317.3200000000002
right here some young people

1338.559 --> 1341.34
anyway

1344.17 --> 1349.78
if you want my opinion okay if you want

1347.86 --> 1352.6
really my opinion and it's very typical

1349.78 --> 1360.6399999999999
because yeah I'm deal with this [ __ ] I

1352.6 --> 1366.1
think that the final battle of the Bible

1360.64 --> 1370.51
is purely in the spiritual world I don't

1366.1 --> 1375.07
think there's any destruction of the

1370.51 --> 1379.81
physical world this is look I've seen

1375.07 --> 1382.51
you very far for some reason like when I

1379.81 --> 1386.08
was pretty much older I oh my god I hope

1382.51 --> 1387.67
that still comes that means that I don't

1386.08 --> 1390.34
really have to worry about this [ __ ]

1387.67 --> 1393.73
that much I really hope that I'll make

1390.34 --> 1397.0
it that far but yeah no freaking total

1393.73 --> 1400.09
Cataclysm okay all the big cities were

1397.0 --> 1403.0
just still as they are some things

1400.09 --> 1407.34
rebuilt but there was no like cracked

1403.0 --> 1411.13
land or serious Cataclysm [ __ ] no I

1407.34 --> 1414.3
think that the entire thing happens

1411.13 --> 1417.7
purely in the spiritual world basically

1414.3 --> 1420.57
unwittingly we are a reflection of what

1417.7 --> 1424.78
is happening and yeah it's already very

1420.57 --> 1427.12
telling people enter the spiritual angle

1424.78 --> 1430.12
by themselves because it is kind of

1427.12 --> 1432.4199999999998
getting kind of obvious and weird it's

1430.12 --> 1435.76
like a giant spiritual warfare

1432.42 --> 1440.5
experiment and we're all witnesses those

1435.76 --> 1442.77
that are capable of seeing it so I think

1440.5 --> 1444.0
that

1442.77 --> 1446.07
yeah if there isn't going to be any

1444.0 --> 1448.8
Cataclysm it's mostly going to be in the

1446.07 --> 1453.1799999999998
spiritual realm paradigms are going to

1448.8 --> 1455.82
be overthrown visions that groups work

1453.18 --> 1458.0700000000002
two words like a heaven type vision of

1455.82 --> 1459.4199999999998
how it how they want it to be and

1458.07 --> 1462.24
they're going to do anything for that

1459.42 --> 1465.9
collectively those things are going to

1462.24 --> 1468.45
be destroyed those dreams the world that

1465.9 --> 1470.97
they want it to be those things may be

1468.45 --> 1477.78
destroyed but I don't think the actual

1470.97 --> 1485.55
world itself will be that's now what I

1477.78 --> 1487.35
am starting to get hints of yeah maybe

1485.55 --> 1490.79
the world itself will need not be

1487.35 --> 1490.79
destroyed maybe just

1491.58 --> 1497.1899999999998
these dreams of how it should be

1494.7 --> 1501.8990000000001
according to certain people and there's

1497.19 --> 1504.0900000000001
multiple realms like this and it was so

1501.899 --> 1507.36
weird because when I saw these things I

1504.09 --> 1510.72
thought they were literal heavens like I

1507.36 --> 1513.6
thought it was like a literal place but

1510.72 --> 1515.34
since I see now more and more that the

1513.6 --> 1517.019
dark world is all just a spiritual

1515.34 --> 1519.09
reflection I'm start to understand it

1517.019 --> 1522.509
completely differently that is these

1519.09 --> 1526.32
realms these these miracle places

1522.509 --> 1528.539
outside of the physical only outside of

1526.32 --> 1530.759
physical they are the dreams they are a

1528.539 --> 1533.399
collective collection of vision shared

1530.759 --> 1536.279
by people of how they want the world to

1533.399 --> 1538.559
end up to become and they build on that

1536.279 --> 1540.45
and some built very long and there's

1538.559 --> 1543.23
these different religions with different

1540.45 --> 1550.19
visions of how the world should be and

1543.23 --> 1553.16
there are so many of them and they all

1550.19 --> 1557.3300000000002
apparently

1553.16 --> 1560.48
are pretty totalitarian in the end it's

1557.33 --> 1563.33
like yeah they could strive for peace

1560.48 --> 1567.169
and balance but apparently the heaven is

1563.33 --> 1571.28
based on how the entire world would be

1567.169 --> 1573.919
once they completely won and it is

1571.28 --> 1580.25
irrational in that sense it is a dream

1573.919 --> 1583.929
that is irrational it is they haven't

1580.25 --> 1586.25
shared by the the minds of these people

1583.929 --> 1589.8500000000001
that believe in that it's very

1586.25 --> 1592.48
fascinating very fascinating and there

1589.85 --> 1592.48
are many of them

1594.66 --> 1600.15
seen at least five and all by the way

1597.72 --> 1604.89
I've seen some of them destroyed

1600.15 --> 1607.3200000000002
I never understood what that meant it

1604.89 --> 1609.72
felt at the time I thought that this is

1607.32 --> 1612.27
the heaven this is like a place that is

1609.72 --> 1614.88
supposed to be and when they were

1612.27 --> 1617.16
destroyed it was like oh my god you know

1614.88 --> 1622.429
they haven't destroyed what is this but

1617.16 --> 1627.0900000000001
no it's not what it was it's just

1622.429 --> 1628.88
certain dreams were halted in their

1627.09 --> 1632.37
tracks

1628.88 --> 1637.0800000000002
people that shared that dream were

1632.37 --> 1641.34
awoken from that dream pulled back to

1637.08 --> 1645.9289999999999
earth out of that dream into the

1641.34 --> 1650.22
physical world again being a human again

1645.929 --> 1652.76
I guess they're not possessed by the

1650.22 --> 1652.76
idea

1656.45 --> 1666.289
anyway yeah please share this show on

1663.32 --> 1669.59
any social media like or any skype chat

1666.289 --> 1671.769
or whatever and yeah because especially

1669.59 --> 1675.1689999999999
this show is probably not gonna be

1671.769 --> 1678.019
widely known though there are 63 few

1675.169 --> 1681.3500000000001
wings that's not bad and yeah if you

1678.019 --> 1684.139
want to get on the panel you know what

1681.35 --> 1686.4499999999998

below yeah

1711.62 --> 1717.51
that's good

1713.32 --> 1717.51
continue this conversation

1725.28 --> 1729.86
yeah and there's another funny thing

1727.32 --> 1729.86
about that

1731.6 --> 1737.3
I knew about flat earthers hidden my

1734.96 --> 1739.22
visions I talked about this like even

1737.3 --> 1740.99
way earlier like I recognized you

1739.22 --> 1743.48
everybody like you were recognized you

1740.99 --> 1747.17
Jay dreamers one of the first people I

1743.48 --> 1749.66
openly Wizard money one of the first

1747.17 --> 1752.75
people that I openly told that I

1749.66 --> 1756.38
recognized in from my vision and the a

1752.75 --> 1757.73
Patricia steer Mike sergeant Tony Asuma

1756.38 --> 1761.6000000000001
rats even I was weird

1757.73 --> 1763.67
many people Martin leak and there's more

1761.6 --> 1766.99
leaking through even this day but I

1763.67 --> 1773.17
recognized them very early on and

1766.99 --> 1776.24
besides that no we in that grant

1773.17 --> 1779.0600000000002
tournament of the of the visions

1776.24 --> 1783.5
whenever you gonna call it no flat

1779.06 --> 1785.36
earthers did not have like a heaven in

1783.5 --> 1790.82
which they wish to transform everything

1785.36 --> 1795.9199999999998
they were just down to earth that's it

1790.82 --> 1798.9399999999998
and also as things progressed by the way

1795.92 --> 1802.13
more if these heavens just died off and

1798.94 --> 1804.77
that's in retrospect kind of a good

1802.13 --> 1809.9
thing it means that more people came

1804.77 --> 1813.23
down to earth and just stop dreaming

1809.9 --> 1817.0600000000002
away and I think that well the dark

1813.23 --> 1821.68
forces were not very pleased about this

1817.06 --> 1826.94
no anyways thank you Dan Winfield for

1821.68 --> 1830.8
donating one pound ninety nine to my

1826.94 --> 1830.8
super chat wizard money

1833.34 --> 1839.9089999999999
everyone lives in my dream sure and I'm

1837.45 --> 1843.48
probably living in your dream and we all

1839.909 --> 1862.0800000000002
live in each other's a dream and in the

1843.48 --> 1864.1390000000001
end we are all God's dream so thanks for

1862.08 --> 1864.139
that

1902.17 --> 1912.99
that's weird God's dream but he denies

1906.7 --> 1912.99
Christ to his God well

1914.21 --> 1919.58
think about it like this the dark

1917.389 --> 1921.649
entities yeah on the other side that

1919.58 --> 1924.11
eyes did see in the dark world

1921.649 --> 1929.389
they definitely denied Christ all right

1924.11 --> 1933.1899999999998
sure until the end okay but I did not

1929.389 --> 1939.559
I don't and the funny thing is is that

1933.19 --> 1943.69
that still look that world is not their

1939.559 --> 1948.32
dream they are part of it

1943.69 --> 1950.96
understand so in essence you could

1948.32 --> 1954.309
almost say that that and everything else

1950.96 --> 1958.159
is God's dream all of it together

1954.309 --> 1963.83
God dreams and all the dimensions it's

1958.159 --> 1967.49
all one pattern and it's all a weave and

1963.83 --> 1971.029
it comes from God from the Creator and

1967.49 --> 1975.74
in this a chocolate and we get to you

1971.029 --> 1979.999
suit in this yeah the the one on the

1975.74 --> 1982.49
inside the one that is at the center and

1979.999 --> 1986.48
outside of it all that's the one that's

1982.49 --> 1990.679
the creator probably the one outside of

1986.48 --> 1996.909
it all very important he's not as a

1990.679 --> 1996.909
person here he is you know

1998.009 --> 2005.97
it's it's complex I tried to figure that

2002.429 --> 2008.1290000000001
stuff out like 10 years ago and not

2005.97 --> 2010.529
entirely sure I'm still trying to work

2008.129 --> 2014.789
out what I actually made all those years

2010.529 --> 2017.34
ago still not ready a chocolate hold on

2014.789 --> 2021.419
let me off my volume so I can hear you

2017.34 --> 2023.58
oh you're muted yeah I don't worry man

2021.419 --> 2025.23
I'm probably gonna be muting in and out

2023.58 --> 2032.129
because I'm at work and I'm not trying

2025.23 --> 2034.409
to anybody's ears you know work around

2032.129 --> 2039.9289999999999
tools and stuff so it might get loud I

2034.409 --> 2052.159
apologize if it's loud for anybody by

2039.929 --> 2052.159
the way thank you right

2052.23 --> 2059.97
that's the whole point one you see it

2055.169 --> 2061.7999999999997
you see it animated do you see that

2059.97 --> 2064.859
animation though yeah I was alike me

2061.8 --> 2069.4500000000003
yeah yeah so that's why it's dark so you

2064.859 --> 2073.129
see at night the lightning strike yes

I'm a big kid everybody it's alright

2073.369 --> 2078.839
what's going on guys he's doing another

2077.01 --> 2081.69
show we're still this morning was pretty

2078.839 --> 2083.94
short right yeah yeah I had an

2081.69 --> 2086.579
appointment and it pretty much

2083.94 --> 2089.339
impossible time so I had to invaded a

2086.579 --> 2091.26
bit and I thought yeah I'm going to do

2089.339 --> 2093.869
extra show I tried to do it a little bit

2091.26 --> 2096.0600000000004
earlier but yeah Riley was having a

2093.869 --> 2098.9100000000003
really good debate hang out on this

2096.06 --> 2103.859
channel so and yeah I tried it before

2098.91 --> 2106.17
and just YouTube just said no like the I

2103.859 --> 2108.5989999999997
had something planned in and every time

2106.17 --> 2110.25
I started that up I would get like a

2108.599 --> 2112.17
second and then it's just like this

2110.25 --> 2114.869
video is not available and the chat

2112.17 --> 2117.06
would just not come into existence it's

2114.869 --> 2121.02
like okay I'm not allowed to go

2117.06 --> 2122.73
livestream them and I even did like a

2121.02 --> 2124.92
live stream and there was nothing no

2122.73 --> 2126.01
notification you couldn't see a live

2124.92 --> 2128.26
video nothing

2126.01 --> 2131.26
and only afterward like did it appear

2128.26 --> 2131.8
somebody people like hey why did this

2131.26 --> 2134.619
come from

2131.8 --> 2140.1000000000004
it's so weird anyway but that that was

2134.619 --> 2140.1000000000004
fixed so I'm doing it right now

2142.08 --> 2147.0699999999997
yeah I mean that's what I'm cool that

2144.46 --> 2149.44
yours if you're doing your early bird

2147.07 --> 2152.38
and while he's doing his little coffee

2149.44 --> 2154.21
shop now everybody is kind of branching

2152.38 --> 2157.63
off inside a little hangouts and so

2154.21 --> 2161.5
giving people more place with the goals

2157.63 --> 2163.9900000000002
more platforms so it's pretty cool I'm

2161.5 --> 2169.71
pretty impressed with Riley's hangouts

2163.99 --> 2171.609
so far and he's he's he's pretty strong

2169.71 --> 2174.01
it's like my god

2171.609 --> 2175.93
like he really handles all these ballers

2174.01 --> 2177.4
and he takes the time and everything

2175.93 --> 2180.97
it's pretty impressive

2177.4 --> 2181.69
sometimes well I mean it's kind of his

2180.97 --> 2184.6
thing right now

2181.69 --> 2187.84
I call him flattered that they usually

2184.6 --> 2190.359
they think would pretty much be the guy

2187.84 --> 2192.369
and everybody else kind of jumps in but

2190.359 --> 2198.04
if it's Riley so you know you can do

2192.369 --> 2200.65
what you've got to do yeah but it's

2198.04 --> 2201.869
interesting to see that so little has

2200.65 --> 2210.46
changed

2201.869 --> 2216.1000000000004
yeah it's the same things like the exact

2210.46 --> 2218.26
same arrival exact same spontaneous oh

2216.1 --> 2220.54
this is new yeah but you've already said

2218.26 --> 2222.9700000000003
that like hundreds of times in the last

2220.54 --> 2227.68
few years yet it's like the first time

2222.97 --> 2230.16
every time to you like these ballers are

2227.68 --> 2233.859
gonna deal with you on this [ __ ]

2230.16 --> 2235.72
shout out to Bill G and now Rizzo was

2233.859 --> 2242.64
not better than Dragon Ball so sad over

2235.72 --> 2242.64
trike I like notes although

2246.15 --> 2251.71
anyway I'm not gonna get into the geek

2248.29 --> 2256.39
[ __ ] yeah I like Dragon Ball Z abridged

2251.71 --> 2262.14
most wretched

2256.39 --> 2263.89
it's a weird like voicemail I for hi

2262.14 --> 2267.0699999999997
dragon walk right

2263.89 --> 2269.74
no no it's a voiceover project by a

2267.07 --> 2273.28
bunch of liberal Americans and it's

2269.74 --> 2285.1899999999996
halfway decent with the liberal jokes

2273.28 --> 2287.6800000000003
it's not freakin annoying I've watched

2285.19 --> 2289.9900000000002
it from the start it's amazing it's like

2287.68 --> 2291.94
one continual story and it's like

2289.99 --> 2293.95
character build up and they made every

2291.94 --> 2298.41
character into like a silly version of

2293.95 --> 2298.41
it but really detailed it's incredible

2299.34 --> 2308.38
and like their Goku is is more Goku than

2305.32 --> 2309.67
the official Goku and when yeah you get

2308.38 --> 2327.82
to see that then you figure out that

2309.67 --> 2333.12
yeah this is really the guy I'll be

2327.82 --> 2335.86
Davison just put a video up some article

2333.12 --> 2340.33
Trump is trying to get up I mean I don't

2335.86 --> 2342.61
know how or whatever but it's always

2340.33 --> 2345.0099999999998
kind of funny that something's trying to

2342.61 --> 2347.53
throw money at happen like why can't we

2345.01 --> 2349.96
go back to the moon like what is it you

2347.53 --> 2351.7900000000004
know like if I up your budget like like

2349.96 --> 2353.8
though all the money in the world at you

2351.79 --> 2356.35
can we get back to the move in like a

2353.8 --> 2363.76
year or two and they're like no pushing

2356.35 --> 2366.97
sort of like the 2030s or something I'm

2363.76 --> 2370.9900000000002
just thinking now like wasn't that the

2366.97 --> 2373.9599999999996
right word not like something during the

2370.99 --> 2379.54
the Wall Street protest thing what is it

2373.96 --> 2382.15
again yeah but what the primary goal was

2379.54 --> 2385.27
is that they they don't indict them they

2382.15 --> 2387.61
wanted their papers to be looked through

2385.27 --> 2394.42
it has a certain word for

2387.61 --> 2399.1400000000003
right that they have to count its guys

2394.42 --> 2409.67
well yeah now I'm asking chat like

2399.14 --> 2412.46
anybody know is that freaking yeah like

2409.67 --> 2416.3
checking the bookkeeping basically well

2412.46 --> 2418.4900000000002
wouldn't it be amazing if Trump would

2416.3 --> 2421.9700000000003
actually do something like that to NASA

2418.49 --> 2424.0099999999998
it's like hey NASA you've been getting

2421.97 --> 2426.14
you two amounts of money and we still

2424.01 --> 2427.6400000000003
haven't gotten to moon I want to see

2426.14 --> 2432.83
what you do with your money

2427.64 --> 2435.44
oh my god wouldn't that be like a like I

2432.83 --> 2439.37
said I can't you know I just posted

2435.44 --> 2439.85
somebody somebody found it posted a good

2439.37 --> 2443.9
place

2439.85 --> 2446.45
I mean I don't know I don't know how you

2443.9 --> 2448.58
know credible it is yeah I just thought

2446.45 --> 2450.3799999999997
it'd be a funny story because it would

2448.58 --> 2456.2599999999998
be kind of funny if some actually says

2450.38 --> 2457.04
all right we're gonna give tenfold so we

2456.26 --> 2458.75
make this happen

2457.04 --> 2462.41
and they still come up with excuses to

2458.75 --> 2464.36
not make it happen yeah bill G found the

2462.41 --> 2466.79
right word auditing it was about

2464.36 --> 2473.7200000000003
auditing the Fed it's like call for the

2466.79 --> 2475.46
auditing of NASA oh my god it's gonna be

2473.72 --> 2478.97
amazing if that happens

2475.46 --> 2482.63
hey if if Trump wants like a huge pile

2478.97 --> 2484.7
of money to rebuild stuff well yeah

2482.63 --> 2488.9900000000002
there is NASA they're pretty much

2484.7 --> 2490.91
useless so that would be you know what

2488.99 --> 2493.31
it is a many bring good he brings up

2490.91 --> 2495.89
Hebron after so much that I'm starting

2493.31 --> 2499.16
to think he's either like like he's

2495.89 --> 2500.7799999999997
really trying to troll them like I don't

2499.16 --> 2504.92
know how I mean it might sound silly but

2500.78 --> 2508.61
like I don't know me but think about it

2504.92 --> 2512.9300000000003
if you were part of the people that

2508.61 --> 2515.75
would use the globe and agendas with

2512.93 --> 2518.69
that yeah I think that Trump I don't

2515.75 --> 2520.25
know if you believe it but he might want

2518.69 --> 2522.32
something good and he's just

2520.25 --> 2525.89
like yeah and now so you're just [ __ ]

2522.32 --> 2526.34
around you know doing nothing what the

2525.89 --> 2528.2599999999998
hell

2526.34 --> 2530.0
so he's just gonna push that play like

2528.26 --> 2531.92
okay now you're gonna actually do

2530.0 --> 2537.74
something good with that money something

2531.92 --> 2539.7200000000003
big big American can do it or we're

2537.74 --> 2541.1
gonna hand you the money back and we're

2539.72 --> 2543.7099999999996
gonna use it for something else

2541.1 --> 2547.13
I maybe that's what he's gonna try you

2543.71 --> 2550.19
know because yeah the NASA is also

2547.13 --> 2553.55
freaking liberals a lot of them it's

2550.19 --> 2555.62
also part yet tied in with with the

2553.55 --> 2559.55
Hollywood crowd and they are liberal as

2555.62 --> 2561.83
demons totally insane so yeah that's a

2559.55 --> 2564.05
problem even with NASA and maybe he's

2561.83 --> 2567.7999999999997
just trying to say like hey stop [ __ ]

2564.05 --> 2571.54
around and make it make NASA great again

2567.8 --> 2574.73
or you're gonna give us your money back

2571.54 --> 2582.83
sensible isn't it one way or the other I

2574.73 --> 2584.93
mean this is why I say because I that

2582.83 --> 2586.73
would be especially because I used to be

2584.93 --> 2589.49
such a space geek I used to love that

2586.73 --> 2592.64
[ __ ] so much I would I would be the

2589.49 --> 2594.4399999999996
first point to be like okay instead of

2592.64 --> 2596.99
going to kill people with Syria and all

2594.44 --> 2600.05
this other [ __ ] let's talk about this

2596.99 --> 2601.6699999999996
moon nonsense let's go back let's start

2600.05 --> 2604.73
going to other places what's up

2601.67 --> 2609.41
you know let's build cool [ __ ] and cool

2604.73 --> 2611.2400000000002
imagery and inspiring war order that's

2609.41 --> 2614.6299999999997
what it was always meant for it like an

2611.24 --> 2617.72
inspiration to work harder right you

2614.63 --> 2620.87
know let's go a little bit beyond

2617.72 --> 2624.8599999999997
sending a car up there for what it is no

2620.87 --> 2628.45
damn reason let's try to get a cool fake

2624.86 --> 2628.4500000000003
picture of space like are you kidding me

2631.63 --> 2639.65
it was a nice try but it was like overly

2637.25 --> 2648.23
cheap they could have done a lot better

2639.65 --> 2649.4300000000003
job but yeah I mean I hope too many

2648.23 --> 2653.809
people weren't holding their breath for

2649.43 --> 2657.0789999999997
China to provide any uh awesome this one

2653.809 --> 2660.559
by to the moon well I think that their

2657.079 --> 2663.7690000000002
narrative will be a lot more careful but

2660.559 --> 2666.739
as for actual visual productions there

2663.769 --> 2669.2589999999996
they've never been stars at that so it's

2666.739 --> 2671.089
not a narrative it's probably gonna be a

2669.259 --> 2673.43
really good science fiction story

2671.089 --> 2675.5589999999997
they're rolling out that sounds really

2673.43 --> 2680.89
logical and everything that feels more

2675.559 --> 2682.5190000000002
real but with not so much like oh we

2680.89 --> 2685.3089999999997
tell me honestly

2682.519 --> 2690.1299999999997
tell me honestly in your opinion did the

2685.309 --> 2695.2090000000003
CGI of China look even worse than NASA

2690.13 --> 2696.859
well maybe add a little bit of color was

2695.209 --> 2703.459
about it yeah

2696.859 --> 2709.42
the CGI cheynet presented was worse then

2703.459 --> 2709.4199999999996
the quick recreation the media did again

2712.239 --> 2719.449
like I would be so sad if I had if I was

2716.93 --> 2723.0789999999997
forced to believe that you know like if

2719.449 --> 2725.089
this was my paradigm and it's how I felt

2723.079 --> 2727.88
before I you know flattered for anything

2725.089 --> 2730.16
like that I was a NASA fanboy and I

2727.88 --> 2732.589
would continuously wait like when are we

2730.16 --> 2734.479
going back to the main we're gonna you

2732.589 --> 2756.769
know when are we gonna get some nice HD

2734.479 --> 2758.779
from you know yeah but it is like it is

2756.769 --> 2761.689
some type of damage control going on

2758.779 --> 2764.15
because spaces everywhere like it's

2761.689 --> 2766.219
ridiculous every video like half the

2764.15 --> 2768.799
videos I click on like there's some

2766.219 --> 2772.009
space and on sensors that's the ad that

2768.799 --> 2774.349
pops up right or if it's not about space

2772.009 --> 2776.779
then at least there's a zoom in from the

2774.349 --> 2779.7090000000003
planets to the place or something

2776.779 --> 2779.709
there's always something

2784.78 --> 2792.9500000000003
but you got to keep a narrative up so

2787.43 --> 2795.5
that's what it is mr. Adam shut up mr.

2792.95 --> 2800.8689999999997
Adam you can check out the whole chat ya

2795.5 --> 2802.04
know and and real quick like I know I

2800.869 --> 2804.5
didn't want I don't want to bring it

2802.04 --> 2808.1
back to the [ __ ] foot like I want to

2804.5 --> 2811.43
I want to say like I don't know I feel

2808.1 --> 2818.63
bad for that whole situation with this

2811.43 --> 2820.5499999999997
Pete dude well the thing I'm the thing

2818.63 --> 2823.4300000000003
I'm really seeing that I'm really kind

2820.55 --> 2825.38
of not liking like it honestly does not

2823.43 --> 2828.14
matter if this guy's a flat earther or

2825.38 --> 2831.83
globe or anything he's obviously a human

2828.14 --> 2833.72
being with problems and I think it's

2831.83 --> 2836.27
[ __ ] up that people are gonna try to

2833.72 --> 2838.7
take that and not only make it as a joke

2836.27 --> 2840.56
but then try to associate that way

2838.7 --> 2842.4199999999996
everybody is you know either a

2840.56 --> 2843.95
conspiracy theorist or flat earther

2842.42 --> 2846.65
because I mean if you're gonna break it

2843.95 --> 2849.5
down technically right all the stabbings

2846.65 --> 2853.25
let's say let's say it was a stabbing

2849.5 --> 2856.13
how many stabbings have occurred by

2853.25 --> 2859.34
people who believe in a ball in the past

2856.13 --> 2862.1600000000003
year let's say right most of you people

2859.34 --> 2864.3500000000004
also the criminals out there i'm cherdon

2862.16 --> 2867.08
most of them were not flattering

2864.35 --> 2884.0299999999997
goalball believers so to say like this

2867.08 --> 2886.2799999999997
guy losses mine but i mean regular let's

2884.03 --> 2889.4300000000003
just say like a regular domestic abuse

2886.28 --> 2891.17
thing i mean most people osbahr as far

2889.43 --> 2893.96
as the paradigm most people will believe

2891.17 --> 2896.63
we develop all right so to associate

2893.96 --> 2899.06
this guy because he lost his [ __ ] for a

2896.63 --> 2901.31
little bit so associated that because

2899.06 --> 2905.75
that's flat earth or like to me that's

2901.31 --> 2910.5499999999997
so immature it's unreal with problems

2905.75 --> 2915.75
it's sick and file and he played obey

2910.55 --> 2919.1200000000003
the evil politicising psychiatrist

2915.75 --> 2921.55
literally it's like the devil in the

2919.12 --> 2923.65
spot to be that violent and just blew

2921.55 --> 2924.4900000000002
somebody's vulnerability in personal

2923.65 --> 2927.58
situation

2924.49 --> 2930.1
so polarize things and make everything

2927.58 --> 2934.93
worse make everyone more aggravated more

2930.1 --> 2938.92
hateful more vengeful sick what you said

2934.93 --> 2941.94
about Timmy putting out videos and

2938.92 --> 2944.44
trying to equate it to everybody like me

2941.94 --> 2946.9
motives to me even person for you to

2944.44 --> 2948.64
like I mean but it's not just you it's

2946.9 --> 2951.88
the whole community yes I do

2948.64 --> 2953.77
everybody is running around and most

2951.88 --> 2958.3
people that establish before hurting

2953.77 --> 2962.08
other people believe in the ball so take

2958.3 --> 2964.36
your excuses and just shut up yeah well

2962.08 --> 2966.52
it's different it's different it's just

2964.36 --> 2969.3700000000003
the guy that's got problems

2966.52 --> 2971.89
yeah and it's [ __ ] up to put him in

2969.37 --> 2974.65
some type of oh yes flatty's over

2971.89 --> 2980.5
whatever whatever it is obviously there

2974.65 --> 2988.03
was something going on you know shitty

2980.5 --> 2991.57
situation yeah maybe when it comes to

2988.03 --> 2994.27
extreme actions you know but when it

2991.57 --> 2996.8500000000004
comes to ballers in general what we do

2994.27 --> 3000.09
notice is that they allow themselves to

2996.85 --> 3003.0899999999997
behave miserably and parasitical towards

3000.09 --> 3006.48
are the others very easily and without

3003.09 --> 3012.2400000000002
regret and that's something that flat

3006.48 --> 3017.27
earthers on average do not do so yeah

3012.24 --> 3020.37
ballers may not be inherently violent

3017.27 --> 3022.86
cuz yeah the playing ground is theirs

3020.37 --> 3037.14
they're allowed to be sick and even be

3022.86 --> 3038.9900000000002
miserable if they want to hey hey there

3037.14 --> 3042.5699999999997
you know when I do in chocolate

3038.99 --> 3044.7299999999996
I'm sure what's going on chief

3042.57 --> 3046.6200000000003
no but I was just sittin listenin to you

3044.73 --> 3049.07
two and I thought I'd add one about it's

3046.62 --> 3049.0699999999997
all coming out

3049.509 --> 3059.15
yeah well you know just trying to

3056.359 --> 3062.869
reflecting on this situation with a pawn

3059.15 --> 3064.849
shop you know I don't know that's why I

3062.869 --> 3071.569
was ringing can you fill me in guys cuz

3064.849 --> 3076.1600000000003
I'm what's occurred well really hang out

3071.569 --> 3079.459
yesterday it was anyway not too long ago

3076.16 --> 3082.609
and yeah apparently Pancho Pete and

3079.459 --> 3084.259
invited the guy over for ten days so he

3082.609 --> 3087.109
said and he got really pissed off at

3084.259 --> 3090.529
some point and then he assaulted that

3087.109 --> 3094.249
guy when he didn't when he refused to

3090.529 --> 3096.109
leave basically from yeah punch of

3094.249 --> 3100.279
Pete's home and that man he went totally

3096.109 --> 3106.459
apeshit over it and presumably assaulted

3100.279 --> 3109.91
him with a knife so that was yep but

3106.459 --> 3111.589
presumably did but anyway the guy is in

3109.91 --> 3114.019
trouble with the police apparently so

3111.589 --> 3114.589
yeah he did go too far and he's in big

3114.019 --> 3119.299
trouble now

3114.589 --> 3123.529
very sad and yeah Tim just went all

3119.299 --> 3126.229
psychiatric cult [ __ ] over this was

3123.529 --> 3128.269
really disgusting comparing me

3126.229 --> 3130.1899999999996
personally and the entire Flat Earth

3128.269 --> 3131.5989999999997
community like well looks that's what

3130.19 --> 3134.42
that's what you happen when you let

3131.599 --> 3136.13
people deal with Flat Earth long enough

3134.42 --> 3138.6800000000003
yeah they all go insane and turn into

3136.13 --> 3143.829
murderous maniacs that he literally did

3138.68 --> 3148.999
that it's like classic Bolsheviks

3143.829 --> 3150.9990000000003
persecution evil sick to do something

3148.999 --> 3154.12
like that

3150.999 --> 3157.6699999999996
so yeah that happened

3154.12 --> 3162.29
kind of kind of sad that you would take

3157.67 --> 3164.1800000000003
quite a sad situation and twist it it's

3162.29 --> 3166.67
almost like a politician isn't it taking

3164.18 --> 3169.52
me massive tragedy for your own benefit

3166.67 --> 3173.69
exactly it's like the CNN puppets or

3169.52 --> 3176.12
like Hillary Obama lying to your face in

3173.69 --> 3179.78
the most disgusting way possible without

3176.12 --> 3185.48
regret enjoying the darkness as they do

3179.78 --> 3187.76
it just listen to his voice is there it

3185.48 --> 3192.47
sounds even more squirmish than he just

3187.76 --> 3195.4100000000003
does usually it's like if he continues

3192.47 --> 3203.12
this up he will tit literally turn into

3195.41 --> 3205.3399999999997
a snake someone with mental health

3203.12 --> 3207.56
issues it sounds like them somebody's

3205.34 --> 3211.9700000000003
exploiting in there bad things often

3207.56 --> 3214.67
flat all around their mates yeah kind of

3211.97 --> 3216.3799999999997
behavior has nothing to do with what

3214.67 --> 3218.2400000000002
what shape you think the earth is that's

3216.38 --> 3221.84
to do with your mental stability if you

3218.24 --> 3223.8799999999997
behave like that UPS indeed and a bunch

3221.84 --> 3229.3700000000003
of Peter had many issues I've seen them

3223.88 --> 3231.35
I tried to point them out and yeah he

3229.37 --> 3233.72
has dark tendencies in him and he

3231.35 --> 3236.96
doesn't deal with them properly and he

3233.72 --> 3240.2599999999998
has very little discipline which is

3236.96 --> 3243.14
required to deal with it so it's always

3240.26 --> 3243.98
been kind of unstable in in the way with

3243.14 --> 3245.6299999999997
ups and downs

3243.98 --> 3249.2
there's very good moments and then it

3245.63 --> 3251.06
has dark moments and yeah it just went

3249.2 --> 3254.8999999999996
completely out of hand here obviously

3251.06 --> 3259.0099999999998
but like who why the hell would that guy

3254.9 --> 3262.55
would punch a Pete invite somebody like

3259.01 --> 3264.7400000000002
what I presume was jazz a condom for 10

3262.55 --> 3268.19
days in your house what the hell is

3264.74 --> 3270.5
wrong with you man who would do

3268.19 --> 3276.92
something like that no it wasn't it

3270.5 --> 3279.32
wasn't jazz I forget the guys name I

3276.92 --> 3282.44
think it's I think it's jazz I'm not

3279.32 --> 3285.1200000000003
sure it's not jet it's not jazz it's not

3282.44 --> 3287.75
jazz a condo mister alcoholic over there

3285.12 --> 3292.1099999999997
I didn't sound like it he was very slow

3287.75 --> 3298.44
no I wasn't that wasn't okay I don't

3292.11 --> 3300.3900000000003
know anyway yeah who would invite if

3298.44 --> 3308.73
you're like a flat earther and you have

3300.39 --> 3311.4
issues why would you invite a baller the

3308.73 --> 3314.82
guy was the guy wasn't a baller it was a

3311.4 --> 3318.42
somebody that was on his panel when you

3314.82 --> 3320.4300000000003
know like his friend I think hold me on

3318.42 --> 3322.83
that but I'm pretty sure like his friend

3320.43 --> 3329.93
who was like who live not too far away

3322.83 --> 3332.1
from like a neighbor it wasn't it was

3329.93 --> 3339.6299999999997
like a neighbor who just happened to

3332.1 --> 3341.7
join or something no I think because I'm

3339.63 --> 3344.76
pretty sure I remember cuz I've been on

3341.7 --> 3347.8199999999997
branches and panel like maybe two or

3344.76 --> 3349.7700000000004
three times and I'm pretty sure the guys

3347.82 --> 3353.19
like they were cool it wasn't like some

3349.77 --> 3361.98
Bolly like come to that's what I don't

3353.19 --> 3362.96
think that's the case from what from

3361.98 --> 3366.0
what yeah I know

3362.96 --> 3368.37
no I'm not the fact I think like I'm

3366.0 --> 3378.39
talking about [ __ ] but it's kind of like

3368.37 --> 3381.06
it's out there already so and I think

3378.39 --> 3383.64
that it's kind of good that we do talk

3381.06 --> 3388.16
about it instead of just letting d-file

3383.64 --> 3392.27
serpents gossip about it internally yeah

3388.16 --> 3395.8799999999997
because I wanted to you know say that

3392.27 --> 3397.44
right Lord Peter flattered up there so

3395.88 --> 3400.7000000000003
you know he's nuts and stabbing people

3397.44 --> 3400.7000000000003
that's not cool

3402.54 --> 3408.12
don't do it and whether you believe in

3406.17 --> 3411.03
the ball or fly if I pull the flash or

3408.12 --> 3412.29
the stab or anything away but you're

3411.03 --> 3416.55
defending yourself right now

3412.29 --> 3417.06
now I will say I will say one thing

3416.55 --> 3418.789
right

3417.06 --> 3421.669
as far as

3418.789 --> 3424.1600000000003
you know playing devil's advocate if I'm

3421.669 --> 3427.009
pissed off and I thought so if I tell

3424.16 --> 3427.609
you to get out of my house yeah you need

3427.009 --> 3431.38
to get out

3427.609 --> 3435.229
exactly that's the only thing because

3431.38 --> 3437.719
like and I get that and I get that

3435.229 --> 3439.6989999999996
because maybe if it's his friend right

3437.719 --> 3441.919
because I I try to look at it like this

3439.699 --> 3443.9590000000003
like if that's my friend right I'm gonna

3441.919 --> 3446.209
try to help them oh so even if he's

3443.959 --> 3448.4289999999996
pissed off and he tells me to get out of

3446.209 --> 3451.339
the house I'm probably not gonna leave

3448.429 --> 3453.38
if that's my friend right but at the

3451.339 --> 3455.209
same time if he is your friend you

3453.38 --> 3458.599
should be able to judge the situation

3455.209 --> 3460.729
and if you see that your boy is not that

3458.599 --> 3466.429
stable I can see that you might want to

3460.729 --> 3471.589
help him out I also just want to leave

3466.429 --> 3474.38
them alone so that that can go either

3471.589 --> 3476.029
way because I don't know if it was me

3474.38 --> 3485.089
I'm some of you would go in my house and

3476.029 --> 3486.499
I'm that pissed off oh yeah it would it

3485.089 --> 3488.949
be over the subject matter that was

3486.499 --> 3492.019
going on and I wouldn't attack my friend

3488.949 --> 3497.449
for that particular reason so obviously

3492.019 --> 3500.39
there's differences but you know anyway

3497.449 --> 3502.969
I'm gonna meet now all right yeah thanks

3500.39 --> 3505.819
for your opinion agreed I made a comment

3502.969 --> 3509.449
in Tim's the UM Tim Chang not saying

3505.819 --> 3511.519
exactly that like yeah look you know if

3509.449 --> 3513.9790000000003
somebody starts yelling on the top of

3511.519 --> 3517.64
their lungs for you to get out of their

3513.979 --> 3521.1789999999996
house their private house you better

3517.64 --> 3523.279
damn well do it you know just do it and

3521.179 --> 3525.079
then afterwards you can try to fix it

3523.279 --> 3526.909
but you can't hang around and try to

3525.079 --> 3530.6890000000003
discuss it when somebody's going berserk

3526.909 --> 3534.279
over a territorial thing like that it's

3530.689 --> 3534.279
just stupid

3534.28 --> 3546.8500000000004
foolish anyway crazy stuff apologies for

3545.56 --> 3547.18
the destruction and thank you for the

3546.85 --> 3553.48
update

3547.18 --> 3560.44
I'm sir Jess Charlie no problem so what

3553.48 --> 3563.05
else is going on guys get busy getting

3560.44 --> 3565.81
ready for Friday really we're hopefully

3563.05 --> 3568.4500000000003
gonna have Cynthia Holland on this week

3565.81 --> 3571.69
we've got the right week for the ex

3568.45 --> 3577.06
national employeed so another chat with

3571.69 --> 3582.85
her I'm gonna have a little run I think

3577.06 --> 3585.58
about scientism Athens done some great

3582.85 --> 3588.13
work this week I think he deserves a bit

3585.58 --> 3592.93
of recognition for so I'm just gonna

3588.13 --> 3593.92
chat about that oh yeah yeah shout out

3592.93 --> 3596.47
to Nathan Oakley

3593.92 --> 3600.58
again in the background he's helped me a

3596.47 --> 3603.31
lot with you too like the guy is always

3600.58 --> 3608.08
there to help you know if you just ask

3603.31 --> 3612.04
him awesome I think he's done that I

3608.08 --> 3615.79
said a great deal of work convincing

3612.04 --> 3620.59
John Day about the definitions he's

3615.79 --> 3623.86
using and he's I think done a great

3620.59 --> 3627.4
service for us all by getting somebody

3623.86 --> 3630.01
with the credentials that John's got to

3627.4 --> 3631.09
be on board and to recognize the point

3630.01 --> 3635.8300000000004
we're making with regards the

3631.09 --> 3639.36
definitions and terminology yeah and I

3635.83 --> 3642.13
think that sir his patience and

3639.36 --> 3644.53
persistence have paid off I think for us

3642.13 --> 3647.9500000000003
all like I said I think it's quite a a

3644.53 --> 3649.51
big a useful thing that all this work

3647.95 --> 3651.85
and these observations that John's gonna

3649.51 --> 3653.53
do I'm gonna the open look to really

3651.85 --> 3659.52
kill down the line or criticism down the

3653.53 --> 3661.69
line do two descriptive purposes it's

3659.52 --> 3663.4
strengthens I think what John's about to

3661.69 --> 3666.459
do with these observations and what

3663.4 --> 3669.38
they'll bill demonstrates her

3666.459 --> 3671.089
curious I have no idea that he was doing

3669.38 --> 3673.9990000000003
gonna plan something supposed to do

3671.089 --> 3677.989
something yeah 2nd of February

3673.999 --> 3680.209
there's the peer-to-peer experiment test

3677.989 --> 3683.63
as it was labeled was labeled experiment

3680.209 --> 3685.5789999999997
now labeled observation so that will be

3683.63 --> 3687.7090000000003
from I think it's worthy to brighten

3685.579 --> 3691.4
much all the distance back 20 miles of

3687.709 --> 3695.229
it so they'll be laser sight test

3691.4 --> 3698.2690000000002
there's quite a few folks in the UK are

3695.229 --> 3700.249
planning on going down there so might be

3698.269 --> 3702.89
huge flat earthers flat left me up as

3700.249 --> 3705.769
well as it you know seen the observation

3702.89 --> 3710.509
so shall be what second of fab so I

3705.769 --> 3712.4289999999996
think it's a week week sadly okay

3712.429 --> 3719.299
bring to the table you know what he I've

3716.63 --> 3722.569
had my issues with the guy certain

3719.299 --> 3725.569
directions but yeah he did indeed break

3722.569 --> 3728.9
open that new layer that foundational

3725.569 --> 3730.609
layer for the Flat Earth community for

3728.9 --> 3734.2090000000003
the Flat Earth debates he absolutely did

3730.609 --> 3737.5989999999997

3767.569 --> 3775.459
the evening for me but yeah I had I had

3773.15 --> 3778.5190000000002
one show earlier at the normal time or a

3775.459 --> 3782.5589999999997
little bit early a half hour early and I

3778.519 --> 3782.5589999999997
just decided to do an extra show

3783.74 --> 3790.04
chuckle when it did you catch um Anthony

3787.609 --> 3794.63
show earlier yeah I did yeah it was

3790.04 --> 3798.5
great it's very intense yeah classic

3794.63 --> 3802.849
again it's just classic baller syndrome

3798.5 --> 3805.25
it's always the same yeah I don't like

3802.849 --> 3808.339
this cord there's there's just so many

3805.25 --> 3812.599
people on there neural troll they just

3808.339 --> 3813.88
argue to argued seems like hmm I don't

3812.599 --> 3816.76
like it either

3813.88 --> 3819.619
but I do find these hangouts that

3816.76 --> 3822.0200000000004
Anthony has been doing recently I do

3819.619 --> 3826.4
find them very interesting and he's

3822.02 --> 3830.24
getting better at what he does so I was

3826.4 --> 3832.79
like wow he's growing up it's getting

3830.24 --> 3834.95
even better it's really intense to see

3832.79 --> 3842.599
that how well he can handle himself

3834.95 --> 3843.68
these days incredible he does I was

3842.599 --> 3846.65
listening to a bit late this afternoon

3843.68 --> 3848.39
and I was finding it very frustrating

3846.65 --> 3853.64
because whilst he's getting back to the

3848.39 --> 3855.95
ballers haven't changed exactly the same

3853.64 --> 3860.39
aren't they and it's like every time

3855.95 --> 3863.96
they spontaneously arrive with like oh

3860.39 --> 3867.41
but this with that and we all heard that

3863.96 --> 3869.63
exact process manifesting so many times

3867.41 --> 3874.52
like the same people will have made the

3869.63 --> 3876.8900000000003
same argument as if new like 10 times in

3874.52 --> 3879.53
the last 22 years and they don't even

3876.89 --> 3882.04
realize it every time it happens that

3879.53 --> 3886.9700000000003
yeah you already said that like 10 times

3882.04 --> 3890.7799999999997
you don't even remember do you it's so

3886.97 --> 3893.6899999999996
freaky it's like a syndrome these people

3890.78 --> 3895.4300000000003
are literally in a syndrome a giant hole

3893.69 --> 3900.109
in their consciousness and it compels

3895.43 --> 3902.6299999999997
them to move around that around those

3900.109 --> 3907.18
holes constantly and it's taken all its

3902.63 --> 3907.1800000000003
taking on a life of its own that process

3908.36 --> 3912.54
they've obviously had a memo from the

3910.71 --> 3914.55
Tavistock Institute or Suffolk alot of

3912.54 --> 3916.11
them looks they're their new thing that

3914.55 --> 3917.9100000000003
you see a lot of at the moment is this

3916.11 --> 3919.8
trying to pin us to a model so you know

3917.91 --> 3922.71
they're using the phrase well that's

3919.8 --> 3925.38
impossible on the flatter so rather than

3922.71 --> 3930.36
on as your phase of all proof yeah on

3925.38 --> 3932.9100000000003
your model it's impossible well that's

3930.36 --> 3935.63
not look look look see that flat earth

3932.91 --> 3938.22
model every claim they make every time

3935.63 --> 3940.23
about would potentially could not work

3938.22 --> 3942.75
on a disc like yeah sorry guys

3940.23 --> 3945.54
this model does actually account for

3942.75 --> 3948.27
every single aspect in that it does work

3945.54 --> 3951.87
it's just unacceptable to you because

3948.27 --> 3953.52
yeah then they'd have to go to that hole

3951.87 --> 3957.45
in their consciousness again and they

3953.52 --> 3961.19
can't so they just and we dismiss it and

3957.45 --> 3961.1899999999996
move on like nothing ever happened

3965.28 --> 3968.27
how was your show this morning army I

3966.93 --> 3974.3399999999997
didn't I didn't catch it

3968.27 --> 3975.39
it was very tertiary and again wow I

3974.34 --> 3979.77
have to admit I don't know what that

3975.39 --> 3981.81
word means okay yeah where are you

3979.77 --> 3985.44
standing on this all wait where's your

3981.81 --> 3988.65
was your way you viewing it from what's

3985.44 --> 3990.96
your this is I've been talking about

3988.65 --> 3995.46
this for three days now pretty intensely

3990.96 --> 4000.35
so yeah how I view it is I've had very

3995.46 --> 4003.44
intense contact and even early on with

4000.35 --> 4009.5
this phenomena with these people these

4003.44 --> 4012.4700000000003
pills skinned larger white people and I

4009.5 --> 4016.21
think they're an important key role

4012.47 --> 4020.18
really in the entire setup of this world

4016.21 --> 4023.8
they're important part of the past that

4020.18 --> 4027.89
helped shape how everything came to be

4023.8 --> 4030.26
the greys it's okay the greys no not the

4027.89 --> 4031.64
even grace no just what's where that

4030.26 --> 4035.36
comes from that that's why they use it

4031.64 --> 4037.79
with it very easy huh that's weird

4035.36 --> 4041.5
that's my head that's my head but to me

4037.79 --> 4044.93
that's where that phrase comes from okay

4041.5 --> 4048.71
well I don't know you could perhaps call

4044.93 --> 4050.83
them atom mites or something I don't

4048.71 --> 4054.02
know they very much look like these

4050.83 --> 4059.93
these sculptures is marble white

4054.02 --> 4066.68
sculpted people you know kind of odds

4059.93 --> 4070.1
but amazing and I think there's a big

4066.68 --> 4072.2799999999997
key role for them from within the occult

4070.1 --> 4074.75
and I think there's a consciousness

4072.28 --> 4078.6200000000003
spiritual battle in which they are

4074.75 --> 4080.89
involved as well and I've had like well

4078.62 --> 4083.0299999999997
you could call it I guess a Vision Quest

4080.89 --> 4086.48
thing about it where I basically

4083.03 --> 4090.7400000000002
remember something from long ago about

4086.48 --> 4092.75
what happened with them and yeah seeing

4090.74 --> 4095.2299999999996
Martinique is

4092.75 --> 4100.609
book works kind of brought me back to

4095.23 --> 4102.62
that and I talked about it so what I

4100.609 --> 4105.9800000000005
think that probably happened and what's

4102.62 --> 4109.0689999999995
still going on it's pretty intense stuff

4105.98 --> 4109.91
very ethereal though so you might want

4109.069 --> 4111.529
to read yeah

4109.91 --> 4116.599999999999
watch my hangout this morning and

4111.529 --> 4118.31
yesterday if you're interested but if

4116.6 --> 4122.27
you want a summary yeah I think they

4118.31 --> 4126.080000000001
were a humanoid people very close to

4122.27 --> 4128.029
humans that existed a plenty around the

4126.08 --> 4132.44
world and I think they were imaginal

4128.029 --> 4137.77
people with heavy talent in music and

4132.44 --> 4142.25
storytelling and magic and trickery to

4137.77 --> 4144.830000000001
like mental trickery and yeah they

4142.25 --> 4149.69
clashed with the humans in a very

4144.83 --> 4155.7789999999995
typical way and they were exterminated

4149.69 --> 4158.8099999999995
most of them and yeah some part was

4155.779 --> 4160.400000000001
basically they just surrendered to death

4158.81 --> 4162.7390000000005
because they refused to get into

4160.4 --> 4165.679
violence and the other half went

4162.739 --> 4168.589
completely maniac and turned into boogie

4165.679 --> 4170.6900000000005
men that were only out for revenge

4168.589 --> 4173.75
against the humans for doing such

4170.69 --> 4177.0199999999995
something so atrocious as to kill a

4173.75 --> 4180.41
perfectly peaceful people for no damn

4177.02 --> 4183.4400000000005
good reason so I think that that is an

4180.41 --> 4185.9
important key for a past and I think

4183.44 --> 4190.37
their spirits may still actually hunt us

4185.9 --> 4196.639999999999
from the other side of those dark ones

4190.37 --> 4199.84
and maybe the light ones are also key

4196.64 --> 4203.71
players maybe they are angels it's

4199.84 --> 4205.78
yeah how far can you can you weave this

4203.71 --> 4208.15
all together with what we experienced

4205.78 --> 4210.099999999999
and what religion tells us you know and

4208.15 --> 4214.839999999999
I think it's extremely far I think it's

4210.1 --> 4217.09
pretty much all of it I think a lot

4214.84 --> 4224.35
centers around these peoples from the

4217.09 --> 4226.51
past you think they're gone no they're

4224.35 --> 4230.71
not entirely gone they intermingled with

4226.51 --> 4233.56
us and they are spread around remnants

4230.71 --> 4237.85
of them are spread around within us then

4233.56 --> 4239.620000000001
humans probably of all races can be

4237.85 --> 4243.34
funny either you don't think they exist

4239.62 --> 4245.89
in other lands they might but if they do

4243.34 --> 4248.860000000001
yeah who's to say that they haven't been

4245.89 --> 4252.04
slaughtered at some point again you know

4248.86 --> 4254.62
the maniac elites they may actually just

4252.04 --> 4258.67
went out their way to just exterminate

4254.62 --> 4261.24
them and destroy every single remnant of

4258.67 --> 4264.22
their original group of people just

4261.24 --> 4267.01
because they're that freaking evil and

4264.22 --> 4268.63
they can follow that obviously you know

4267.01 --> 4272.38
in terms of their destruction do you

4268.63 --> 4274.54
this is someone's asking mind do you

4272.38 --> 4279.28
think then that they're whoever

4274.54 --> 4282.1
destroyed them is in control of if it

4279.28 --> 4283.84
exists Hyperborean or do you think

4282.1 --> 4287.620000000001
that's where they've retreated see I

4283.84 --> 4289.4800000000005
kinda wanna hope that there is that they

4287.62 --> 4292.0
retreated out of this row are these

4289.48 --> 4297.209999999999
these these lands and left us to it

4292.0 --> 4300.52
right and maybe they can and we can't

4297.21 --> 4303.58
maybe they can psionically open those

4300.52 --> 4305.740000000001
gates we've heard about because they

4303.58 --> 4307.99
have the key in their spirit because

4305.74 --> 4310.66
they can actually ascend to those realms

4307.99 --> 4312.7
and you regular humans can't because

4310.66 --> 4315.01
they don't have that capability maybe

4312.7 --> 4317.05
it's something like that maybe they

4315.01 --> 4320.860000000001
retreated back into heaven and we can't

4317.05 --> 4323.43
follow who knows I don't know if it's

4320.86 --> 4323.429999999999
like that

4323.56 --> 4329.4800000000005
but yeah what was the one you wanna

4325.82 --> 4331.4
speak to on this is Walt Walter flat

4329.48 --> 4336.44
earth had these the guy that if you're

4331.4 --> 4340.25
talking more realms and certainly

4336.44 --> 4343.428999999999
operating on different you say anythi

4340.25 --> 4346.55
realtor said he's an experienced of this

4343.429 --> 4347.96
sort stuffers or personal stuff that in

4346.55 --> 4353.21
the past he would have put down two

4347.96 --> 4354.62
aliens that he knows it's not but yeah

4353.21 --> 4358.429
you should have a chat with Walt

4354.62 --> 4361.79
sometime it's some of these descriptions

4358.429 --> 4363.26
you I think would you would resonate

4361.79 --> 4367.219
with you I think all in the way you're

4363.26 --> 4370.1900000000005
talking there yeah probably yeah I'd

4367.219 --> 4372.7390000000005
love to have him over you know yeah okay

4370.19 --> 4376.599999999999
if you can pass on my skype to him I

4372.739 --> 4379.669999999999
will do I'm saying that I've got a IRM

4376.6 --> 4382.58
tree shape believe it or not we don't we

4379.67 --> 4384.46
do try and plan the chaos that is a

4382.58 --> 4387.32
Friday night

4384.46 --> 4392.39
so got that if I've got that Fe core

4387.32 --> 4395.2699999999995
meeting in a bit as well no yes I'm

4392.39 --> 4396.9800000000005
Gossett there but he see what they're

4395.27 --> 4401.120000000001
doing always they seeing that what they

4396.98 --> 4403.58
filed with YouTube what sorry we know

4401.12 --> 4407.989
Riley the other day didn't he did an

4403.58 --> 4409.3099999999995
Effie call me thing on YouTube and I was

4407.989 --> 4410.69
watching and literally just as it was

4409.31 --> 4417.110000000001
about to end

4410.69 --> 4419.87
they got copyright strike what yeah well

4417.11 --> 4422.0599999999995
it was everything so the whole content

4419.87 --> 4426.86
it was filed by some media company

4422.06 --> 4430.159000000001
registered in the UK is it that same

4426.86 --> 4434.299999999999
company that went after Nathan no this

4430.159 --> 4437.929
is so as far as I know they've contacted

4434.3 --> 4440.3
the company Fe core then this company

4437.929 --> 4443.12
knows nothing about it they're not

4440.3 --> 4445.4890000000005
they're not happy about you know YouTube

4443.12 --> 4449.03
basically opening them up through

4445.489 --> 4450.139999999999
insufficient checks to litigation that's

4449.03 --> 4452.54
got nothing to do with them because

4450.14 --> 4455.42
youtube doesn't other correct screening

4452.54 --> 4456.5
mechanism before it initiates their

4455.42 --> 4458.24
stuff

4456.5 --> 4461.03
and what YouTube do initiate they

4458.24 --> 4463.01
initiate the defendant to file a legal

4461.03 --> 4465.08
claim against this company well this

4463.01 --> 4467.18
company's not filed it so YouTube

4465.08 --> 4469.64
haven't done their due diligence by

4467.18 --> 4472.13
checking with the of the company whether

4469.64 --> 4472.67
this claim is genuine they just hand it

4472.13 --> 4474.61
over

4472.67 --> 4478.76
but suspend the account but in doing so

4474.61 --> 4481.94
that means the youtuber is subject to

4478.76 --> 4484.34
damages yes consequently opens the other

4481.94 --> 4487.639999999999
company up to litigation if they don't

4484.34 --> 4491.06
respond correctly instantly there then

4487.64 --> 4494.780000000001
liable for damages as well to the

4491.06 --> 4496.85
injured party on the so this is as far

4494.78 --> 4499.91
as are aware this company's not happy

4496.85 --> 4503.63
with YouTube and their support in a fake

4499.91 --> 4506.54
or and challenging YouTube and the way

4503.63 --> 4509.95
they deal with these things so here it

4506.54 --> 4513.0199999999995
almost sounds like a bureaucracy issue

4509.95 --> 4515.84
but instead of a government local

4513.02 --> 4519.110000000001
government its YouTube doing almost like

4515.84 --> 4521.47
a bureaucracy just messing it up so

4519.11 --> 4521.469999999999
weird

4521.689 --> 4525.650000000001
so all that they do that but they don't

4524.539 --> 4527.469
just fix it

4525.65 --> 4529.699
come on how hard is it you have

4527.469 --> 4531.409
potentially hundreds of millions of

4529.699 --> 4535.598999999999
programmers around the world so why

4531.409 --> 4543.049999999999
can't you just fix the damn issues guys

4535.599 --> 4549.139
so silly little bit interesting more all

4543.05 --> 4551.9890000000005
that plays out I think yeah I hope it

4549.139 --> 4553.51
works out yes does is kind of a waste

4551.989 --> 4556.19
that they

4553.51 --> 4561.909000000001
because its copyright struck we can't

4556.19 --> 4564.219
see it basically let's now the result

4561.909 --> 4566.589999999999
well it goes into the process so it will

4564.219 --> 4568.71
still follow the process but I think

4566.59 --> 4572.29
there's other challenges hopefully and

4568.71 --> 4575.409
caser this is a good one because I think

4572.29 --> 4577.78
unlike nathan's where dodgy company's

4575.409 --> 4581.19
been formed to to file these claims this

4577.78 --> 4584.55
is this is a identity theft issue and

4581.19 --> 4587.409
and it appears that YouTube have

4584.55 --> 4589.75
facilitated in the identity theft of

4587.409 --> 4590.23
this company's identity in the copyright

4589.75 --> 4592.29
claim

4590.23 --> 4597.449
because they validated it in a way and

4592.29 --> 4600.79
asked efi core whoever it would be to

4597.449 --> 4602.469
respond to this company and start legal

4600.79 --> 4606.219
action to defend themself against this

4602.469 --> 4608.02
company so that this riley's the sort of

4606.219 --> 4612.389
person unique is the legal issues but

4608.02 --> 4615.31
you can see we're injured parties can

4612.389 --> 4617.11
because if you're this company knows

4615.31 --> 4619.389
nothing about it you're also an injured

4617.11 --> 4622.599999999999
party and the only party that's

4619.389 --> 4624.25
responsible for this is YouTube because

4622.6 --> 4626.26
they've accepted the claimant forwarded

4624.25 --> 4630.429
it on to another boy for you to have to

4626.26 --> 4632.56
defend yourself against so it's gonna be

4630.429 --> 4633.969
interesting because it's this company is

4632.56 --> 4634.51
interested in saying this is out of

4633.969 --> 4636.159
order

4634.51 --> 4637.6900000000005
we're not opening ourselves up to this

4636.159 --> 4640.929
anybody can just keep doing this in our

4637.69 --> 4644.23
name and YouTube will strike the channel

4640.929 --> 4646.9
first well we're not happy about like

4644.23 --> 4650.169999999999
because we're not doing it so I mean so

4646.9 --> 4651.759999999999
it would seem positive as it moves

4650.17 --> 4656.38
forward is it unravels that they're

4651.76 --> 4662.04
gonna have to you don't respond in some

4656.38 --> 4666.61
way fix the procedure to make damn sense

4662.04 --> 4669.19
they can just actually strike the target

4666.61 --> 4672.4
first before they have technically

4669.19 --> 4674.29
confirmed the legitimacy of the of these

4672.4 --> 4679.0199999999995
claims it's ridiculous that's the other

4674.29 --> 4682.929
way around yeah it can turn anyone yeah

4679.02 --> 4685.429
yeah anyone can pick up the weapon and

4682.929 --> 4688.519
just assault somebody and then

4685.429 --> 4691.099
it's nothing to stop them except a

4688.519 --> 4694.67
long-winded process afterward that just

4691.099 --> 4698.389
causes damage to YouTube itself so it's

4694.67 --> 4701.469
really totally stupid totally stupid

4698.389 --> 4701.469
that it works like this

4702.28 --> 4710.78
so yeah YouTube's fix it fix the

4705.709 --> 4717.499
procedure it's not that difficult it's

4710.78 --> 4720.079
like are you guys like I don't see any

4717.499 --> 4723.019
reason why they don't fix this this type

4720.079 --> 4725.03
of thing it's so so quickly done you

4723.019 --> 4727.639
just changed the procedures you just

4725.03 --> 4730.67
changed the policies the base policies

4727.639 --> 4733.519
of how these things are done and you got

4730.67 --> 4736.519
it fixed you don't even have to make a

4733.519 --> 4738.320000000001
huge new up program a huge new thing or

4736.519 --> 4741.469
something that costs a lot of money just

4738.32 --> 4744.728999999999
a few tweaks and it's done how hard is

4741.469 --> 4744.729
this guys come on

4751.01 --> 4756.06
so that's happening now apparently well

4754.83 --> 4758.79
that press the Starks I think the

4756.06 --> 4760.5
copyright strike so as I said it was

4758.79 --> 4762.54
literally as Riley was winding up there

4760.5 --> 4769.469
was even Karin Bay and as they were wild

4762.54 --> 4771.81
you know it just caught so we'll see

4769.469 --> 4773.61
where it goes around there I suppose but

4771.81 --> 4775.29
like I said it's an interesting one

4773.61 --> 4779.159
because it is a different approach and

4775.29 --> 4781.86
it's it appears that the other party is

4779.159 --> 4784.409
in support of saying this this process

4781.86 --> 4787.5599999999995
is ridiculous so for me that's quite

4784.409 --> 4791.04
positive if you've got both the

4787.56 --> 4795.0
defendant and the accuser saying this is

4791.04 --> 4797.219
nonsense you've allowed my identity to

4795.0 --> 4799.71
be stolen in this process so that's

4797.219 --> 4802.35
where I think it might require because

4799.71 --> 4804.69
they can ignore stuff like Nathan's all

4802.35 --> 4807.719
day long partner because it's just

4804.69 --> 4810.78
always nothing we can do about that it's

4807.719 --> 4812.969
somebody committing fraud but now

4810.78 --> 4815.009999999999
somebody coming forward is bringing

4812.969 --> 4817.469
other other parties outside of the

4815.01 --> 4821.1900000000005
YouTuber into it so their process should

4817.469 --> 4825.119
have to accommodate as you said earlier

4821.19 --> 4827.4
a validation process of the claim just

4825.119 --> 4830.33
the order by which the procedure goes

4827.4 --> 4830.33
it's so simple

4836.15 --> 4840.7699999999995
yeah why don't they who's not willing to

4839.78 --> 4845.74
go there

4840.77 --> 4845.740000000001
I wonder what's holding them up

4848.53 --> 4854.84
at a time this is that entire is Manik

4851.87 --> 4857.75
so you know that's the reality instead

4854.84 --> 4859.51
of someone operator pressing action on a

4857.75 --> 4863.21
key they're gonna have to have somebody

4859.51 --> 4865.75
contact the other party to confirm the

4863.21 --> 4869.6
validity of the claim from the company

4865.75 --> 4871.93
directly you know to go Glee and that

4869.6 --> 4874.1900000000005
that takes time and money done to him

4871.93 --> 4876.68
that's probably why it was set up in the

4874.19 --> 4879.759999999999
first place like that but unfortunately

4876.68 --> 4883.43
now it's open to abuse and they should

4879.76 --> 4885.4400000000005
have to respond accordingly if if there

4883.43 --> 4888.29
is an issue about that every time

4885.44 --> 4891.98
somebody does that and they can do it

4888.29 --> 4894.739
falsely that actually costs you two well

4891.98 --> 4896.9
make a procedure for that as well and

4894.739 --> 4901.218999999999
that is if you're claiming a false claim

4896.9 --> 4904.37
you're actually gonna pay for for the

4901.219 --> 4906.08
work that was needed to confirm that and

4904.37 --> 4908.57
all just so if you're gonna do a false

4906.08 --> 4910.28
claim yeah you're gonna be fine for it

4908.57 --> 4914.12
basically it's the same thing in this

4910.28 --> 4916.25
country if you call 9-1-1 without an

4914.12 --> 4919.04
actual emergency you're gonna have a

4916.25 --> 4920.9
problem I think they find you for that

4919.04 --> 4922.58
and maybe they give you a warning at

4920.9 --> 4925.58
first I don't know but you're not

4922.58 --> 4927.38
supposed to do that because you're yeah

4925.58 --> 4929.69
you're wasting these people's time and

4927.38 --> 4932.87
others could in be endangered even from

4929.69 --> 4936.889999999999
that at times so yeah with YouTube if

4932.87 --> 4939.0199999999995
you're gonna file a false claim then you

4936.89 --> 4942.5
should pay for that you should pay for

4939.02 --> 4945.290000000001
the damages for the extra employees that

4942.5 --> 4948.17
were required to figure out that you

4945.29 --> 4951.23
were making a false claim it's very

4948.17 --> 4953.63
simple so make the claim er pay for it

4951.23 --> 4957.049999999999
it's kind of it is kind of very similar

4953.63 --> 4960.38
to the judicial system you know it's

4957.05 --> 4963.68
like in the Netherlands you can pretty

4960.38 --> 4967.04
much get a lawyer from the state but if

4963.68 --> 4971.360000000001
you're in the wrong in a process then

4967.04 --> 4974.36
you do have to pay for it so it's like

4971.36 --> 4976.46
that and that kind of works and yeah

4974.36 --> 4977.919
YouTube should should have a similar

4976.46 --> 4982.74
setup

4977.919 --> 4985.7
I think

4982.74 --> 4985.7
what do you think

4987.02 --> 4990.860000000001
I think to ask them to what they do is

4989.39 --> 4992.63
they wash the hands of it don't they

4990.86 --> 4995.089999999999
they say all this legal action and will

4992.63 --> 4997.01
respond if you're prepared to go to

4995.09 --> 5000.34
court with them which i think is what

4997.01 --> 5001.4800000000005
Mason's was like wasn't it so the the

5000.34 --> 5004.6
point I see what they're doing at the

5001.48 --> 5007.209999999999
moment is kind of saying all there's a

5004.6 --> 5011.38
dispute here taking it away and asking

5007.21 --> 5014.59
the parties to resolve it but I said

5011.38 --> 5020.4400000000005
this this the way they the process works

5014.59 --> 5022.75
at the moment is open to abuse and open

5020.44 --> 5025.989
to bringing into innocent parties into

5022.75 --> 5027.91
the process so while she can't expect

5025.989 --> 5030.91
them to mitigate in these circumcise

5027.91 --> 5034.15
them to do that I do think as you said

5030.91 --> 5037.8
earlier a validation of the claim is

5034.15 --> 5042.129999999999
required before anybody's channels are

5037.8 --> 5044.89
actually affected so of course but there

5042.13 --> 5047.67
still needs to be damage control because

5044.89 --> 5050.02
yeah yeah people are gonna slack

5047.67 --> 5052.6
inappropriately thousands and thousands

5050.02 --> 5054.7300000000005
of thousands of times then that's gonna

5052.6 --> 5057.88
cost YouTube a lot of employees to

5054.73 --> 5061.089999999999
double-check all these things that's why

5057.88 --> 5064.54
I say okay if you're gonna false claim

5061.09 --> 5067.03
then you're gonna be fined that's fine

5064.54 --> 5069.46
if it's if it's a claim that's coming

5067.03 --> 5072.219
from another YouTube channel that I

5069.46 --> 5075.76
think that the trouble would be as if

5072.219 --> 5077.71
it's coming from a Potter another party

5075.76 --> 5080.5
like a register coming like in Nathan's

5077.71 --> 5084.07
case then he does require validation but

5080.5 --> 5086.11
it's very difficult because if you put a

5084.07 --> 5091.2699999999995
copyright claim in you know you're

5086.11 --> 5094.089999999999
you're entitled to do that and you not I

5091.27 --> 5095.620000000001
don't think you would have to will you'd

5094.09 --> 5097.4800000000005
have to sign a separate contract to say

5095.62 --> 5102.58
I'm happy to pay costs extra costs to

5097.48 --> 5106.0599999999995
YouTube the issue is is like in this

5102.58 --> 5106.6
case where you've got quite a troll is

5106.06 --> 5108.67
false

5106.6 --> 5110.8
that's it yeah if you can trace the

5108.67 --> 5112.06
person but it and ie they've got a

5110.8 --> 5114.55
channel but if you've got somebody

5112.06 --> 5118.030000000001
that's doing identity theft of a

5114.55 --> 5119.860000000001
registered company well they're not

5118.03 --> 5121.87
going to be traceable to sue

5119.86 --> 5124.03
to get costs back from are they because

5121.87 --> 5125.92
they're it's criminal basically this

5124.03 --> 5128.59
kind of action isn't it because it is

5125.92 --> 5130.9
absolutely yeah says they're not going

5128.59 --> 5132.610000000001
to be traced appalled by but what it

5130.9 --> 5133.889999999999
should be it's traceable by the law like

5132.61 --> 5137.5599999999995
you saying because it does become

5133.89 --> 5140.35
identity theft and and unbasic aliy you

5137.56 --> 5142.51
know it's that's where it will jump

5140.35 --> 5146.35
that's where the police investigator

5142.51 --> 5147.88
should be called on cybercrime as simple

5146.35 --> 5150.04
as that and they have to take it from

5147.88 --> 5153.79
that point on when YouTube does indeed

5150.04 --> 5156.76
in detects identity theft and I think

5153.79 --> 5163.78
they do do that but they actually have

5156.76 --> 5164.62
to confirm it first so get it fixed

5163.78 --> 5166.78
YouTube

5164.62 --> 5168.07
sounds like we fixed the oven sounds

5166.78 --> 5171.94
like we've already got it soared make

5168.07 --> 5174.88
this for a fee will tell them I hope

5171.94 --> 5178.2699999999995
they are listening I really do because

5174.88 --> 5181.26
this is in your best interest okay if if

5178.27 --> 5185.43
it's a money issue this is how you do it

5181.26 --> 5187.77
and this is how you damage control so

5185.43 --> 5194.92
yeah

5187.77 --> 5197.02
stop fooling around and fix it on that

5194.92 --> 5199.39
mate I'm gonna have to do one but cheers

5197.02 --> 5202.27
probably Mazon all right yeah yeah it's

5199.39 --> 5204.01
good to have you man well here I was in

5202.27 --> 5206.05
the day you see yeah I have your on in

5204.01 --> 5208.42
the background and often I'm dipping in

5206.05 --> 5209.74
and out but so I never get chance to

5208.42 --> 5212.95
come on but as soon as I saw was on

5209.74 --> 5214.48
tonight for I quit bosses been a good

5212.95 --> 5216.51
it's good it's good oh and you've

5214.48 --> 5219.04
certainly a help the community pal

5216.51 --> 5221.2
whilst Nathan's been down and I think

5219.04 --> 5222.73
outside of that carved a little niche

5221.2 --> 5224.679999999999
for yourself way I look forward to even

5222.73 --> 5229.48
when Nathan's but you carrying this on

5224.68 --> 5231.610000000001
because it's it's a different vibe you

5229.48 --> 5234.28
know I mean and yeah keep it up pal

5231.61 --> 5237.19
thank you yeah appreciate I do my best

5234.28 --> 5239.8
and I don't know if Nathan would come

5237.19 --> 5241.509999999999
back with the debates I don't know how

5239.8 --> 5244.87
that will work it's it's almost like

5241.51 --> 5248.7390000000005
could I even go back to the way things

5244.87 --> 5250.63
were or what it does not work and you

5248.739 --> 5253.03
more and I'd stick to this I don't know

5250.63 --> 5256.21
I never liked one it why would it work

5253.03 --> 5259.509999999999
out because I'm so used to having my own

5256.21 --> 5261.309
space now yeah but there's nothing

5259.51 --> 5263.110000000001
nothing says you have to give up your

5261.309 --> 5265.929
space when anything comes back your

5263.11 --> 5270.098999999999
shows always before his right it would

5265.929 --> 5271.539
be extra annoying it's like moving back

5270.099 --> 5283.4490000000005
in with your parents you're gonna have

5271.539 --> 5287.53
to do my own show nobody yelling at me

5283.449 --> 5289.178999999999
now is when you wanna show sure when he

5287.53 --> 5292.509999999999
says it when he comes on here

5289.179 --> 5294.1900000000005
tell em to show so especially if you're

5292.51 --> 5295.929
in one of those moods where you really

5294.19 --> 5298.089999999999
want to talk as you know we all know you

5295.929 --> 5300.369
got those moods right what you really

5298.09 --> 5302.92
want to talk so just get on your show

5300.369 --> 5320.409
let it all out for the whole hour don't

5302.92 --> 5323.11
even have guests I don't know but yeah I

5320.409 --> 5327.129999999999
do wanna know honestly all people seem

5323.11 --> 5328.598999999999
to like your show you know it is it is a

5327.13 --> 5330.13
little different from the splatter of

5328.599 --> 5331.84
the bass which is good because you don't

5330.13 --> 5334.809
we don't need another flatter mr. Bates

5331.84 --> 5337.78
you know we got one and it's coming back

5334.809 --> 5339.369000000001
I'm pretty sure of that so yeah man I

5337.78 --> 5347.139
think you should hold on to this this is

5339.369 --> 5348.759999999999
cool I've heard bowlers say that what

5347.139 --> 5349.96
does make fun of Owen but they like it

5348.76 --> 5352.570000000001
so that's just weird

5349.96 --> 5355.36
but okay I think where's my college

5352.57 --> 5357.19
invited in this too because some ballers

5355.36 --> 5359.86
like me and they actually defend me

5357.19 --> 5362.768999999999
against the other ballers that just have

5359.86 --> 5365.86
become even more merciless yeah it's a

5362.769 --> 5367.599
weird dichotomy right like like some

5365.86 --> 5369.249
people like Nathan some people hate them

5367.599 --> 5372.309
some people like you some people hate

5369.249 --> 5373.599
hate you and then same with Riley I mean

5372.309 --> 5376.4800000000005
I guess you know everybody's got that

5373.599 --> 5378.1900000000005
preference but like just I guess the

5376.48 --> 5381.959999999999
structure of the show I guess people

5378.19 --> 5381.96
just don't like Nathan just strong

5382.07 --> 5388.159
I can kind of understand that if I was

5384.679 --> 5390.32
on the receiving end of that know learn

5388.159 --> 5392.839999999999
to answer questions properly we wouldn't

5390.32 --> 5395.719
have that going on but you know whatever

5392.84 --> 5398.599
but they don't like his power when

5395.719 --> 5402.29
Nathan gets pissed off don't use this

5398.599 --> 5405.889
British voice you know Danson the strict

5402.29 --> 5410.63
old teacher you you can't beat that you

5405.889 --> 5412.639
just it is so naturally in an authority

5410.63 --> 5425.02
position just they can't handle it's

5412.639 --> 5425.02
like no that's supposed to be elegant I

5432.04 --> 5438.079
get it it hurts again it hurts that that

5436.01 --> 5442.6900000000005
hole in their consciousness and yeah

5438.079 --> 5442.69
Nathan really knows how to squeeze it

5444.35 --> 5448.04
[Music]

5445.84 --> 5449.9490000000005
well that's cool well like I said before

5448.04 --> 5453.349
it's cool that everybody's kind of

5449.949 --> 5456.888999999999
branching off I'm not really a Holst

5453.349 --> 5460.25
type person so I probably won't be

5456.889 --> 5465.92
starting the show but you never know you

5460.25 --> 5471.28
know if happens all night but I'd rather

5465.92 --> 5473.75
be the guy that comes through you know

5471.28 --> 5476.199
yeah it's always good to have you on the

5473.75 --> 5480.309
panel and yeah you've become like a

5476.199 --> 5480.308999999999
widely known panelists

5484.0 --> 5489.17
well I mean I like I like this this

5486.8 --> 5491.09
subject and it's if the subject is cool

5489.17 --> 5492.9800000000005
the community is awesome you know

5491.09 --> 5496.099
sometimes I even have phone with

5492.98 --> 5497.928999999999
patrollers you know I don't mind a

5496.099 --> 5500.9890000000005
little back and forth sometimes you know

5497.929 --> 5508.76
I mean so

5500.989 --> 5510.23
you know I'd ask if they everybody's

5508.76 --> 5512.12

5602.36 --> 5606.639999999999
guys god bless ya yes sir

5609.01 --> 5616.400000000001
well everybody's getting weird and chat

5611.449 --> 5620.629999999999
here what is up with this paganism like

5616.4 --> 5623.808999999999
what is that even to know said room it's

5620.63 --> 5627.219
just the paganism you have over you

5623.809 --> 5629.78
there's weird fundamentalist Christian

5627.219 --> 5630.65
stuff all of a sudden like where's this

5629.78 --> 5633.13
coming from

5630.65 --> 5637.46
do you think that that is a false

5633.13 --> 5641.389
dichotomy as well you know like if it's

5637.46 --> 5643.61
if it's anything not the Bible then it

5641.389 --> 5645.59
is automatically of the devil no I think

5643.61 --> 5648.558999999999
it's more subtle than that it's more

5645.59 --> 5651.7390000000005
about the spirit of things and yeah the

5648.559 --> 5653.659000000001
ancient pagans probably had some dark

5651.739 --> 5654.86
traditions that were obviously not of

5653.659 --> 5658.539
the light that doesn't mean the whole

5654.86 --> 5661.759999999999
thing is dark by default and so did the

5658.539 --> 5664.039
manifested Christian religions and the

5661.76 --> 5667.7300000000005
Institute's obviously have darkness in

5664.039 --> 5670.219
them so who are you to say that paganism

5667.73 --> 5675.049999999999
is automatically all of the devil you

5670.219 --> 5679.429
know it's just another culture from from

5675.05 --> 5681.63
another era that did not adapt to that

5679.429 --> 5685.7390000000005
method

5681.63 --> 5688.1990000000005
I haven't see it really I just feel it

5685.739 --> 5690.8099999999995
it's the light or it's the darkness it's

5688.199 --> 5693.8099999999995
the method and that is how you know it

5690.81 --> 5696.75
and it can be in anything dark method

5693.81 --> 5701.579000000001
light method you can find it in all

5696.75 --> 5702.63
things it's all about what you do what

5701.579 --> 5704.82
you do with it

5702.63 --> 5706.889
are you gonna walk the path or are you

5704.82 --> 5709.889
gonna walk into the darkness are you are

5706.889 --> 5711.57
you gonna straight there that's where it

5709.889 --> 5713.369
is and some paganism it's in

5711.57 --> 5719.989
Christianity it's in all of it

5713.369 --> 5719.989
everything so no I'm not gonna

5722.179 --> 5730.53
pagan is to worship no other gods really

5725.699 --> 5732.659
really well how about the worshipping of

5730.53 --> 5734.94
gods or a God

5732.659 --> 5742.009999999999
how about worshipping you think

5734.94 --> 5742.009999999999
worshipping is good of anything

5742.92 --> 5747.33
I don't think so not to an extent where

5745.71 --> 5749.81
you're losing yourself

5747.33 --> 5752.25
I don't but isn't that what it is isn't

5749.81 --> 5757.35
worshiping very simply spiritually

5752.25 --> 5760.26
spiritually declaring lordship you no

5757.35 --> 5763.05
more power you are spiritually enslaving

5760.26 --> 5769.08
yourself that is the did the act of

5763.05 --> 5771.0
worshipping I don't do that I I walk in

5769.08 --> 5774.84
the path of Christ it's all equal

5771.0 --> 5778.77
that's worship some freaking statue or

5774.84 --> 5784.35
some authority figure there to be to

5778.77 --> 5787.650000000001
tell me what to do okay whatever this be

5784.35 --> 5789.990000000001
some weird all druidic high priest or

5787.65 --> 5791.87
something like that or if it's a pope

5789.99 --> 5794.28
with the freaking hat and a staff

5791.87 --> 5797.58
doesn't really matter doesn't get

5794.28 --> 5801.83
doesn't there's no difference there is

5797.58 --> 5804.96
no difference it's exactly the same [ __ ]

5801.83 --> 5810.09
we're shipping it's the worshipping part

5804.96 --> 5813.33
that's what's wrong and it's not about a

5810.09 --> 5818.01
disappearance in it's not oh you have to

5813.33 --> 5820.74
do it you have to take the power of

5818.01 --> 5824.79
creation that was given to you by the

5820.74 --> 5827.82
creator and take responsibility that's

5824.79 --> 5830.25
it and if you worship something you you

5827.82 --> 5833.849999999999
basically give that responsibility away

5830.25 --> 5838.14
and you enslave yourself no matter what

5833.85 --> 5842.97
it is whether it be a woman whether it

5838.14 --> 5847.700000000001
be an authority figure whether it be

5842.97 --> 5850.92
some something amazing you saw some

5847.7 --> 5855.2699999999995
whatever a vision anything worshiping

5850.92 --> 5858.03
anything is just no just takes you away

5855.27 --> 5861.22
from your Center you have to do it

5858.03 --> 5865.719999999999
yourself to do it all

5861.22 --> 5869.68
and recognize peace understand recognize

5865.72 --> 5873.76
be at peace worshipping I don't know I

5869.68 --> 5876.91
just maybe I'm not even getting the

5873.76 --> 5879.49
words right but it just feels like it is

5876.91 --> 5886.09
giving away your authority to something

5879.49 --> 5888.49
else and I guess that surrendering to

5886.09 --> 5891.37
the Spirit of Christ in a moment of

5888.49 --> 5894.2699999999995
crisis like that yeah you could call

5891.37 --> 5897.88
that worship again it is kind of like

5894.27 --> 5901.540000000001
just giving it away but that's different

5897.88 --> 5905.04
that's like a energy process it is more

5901.54 --> 5908.05
mystical is that even worshiping it is

5905.04 --> 5911.29
spiritual it seems almost like

5908.05 --> 5916.3
surrendering to a higher power but is

5911.29 --> 5921.46
that worshiping is that making it your

5916.3 --> 5926.38
ruler or is it just surrendering to

5921.46 --> 5929.2
something greater than you because it is

5926.38 --> 5931.51
ordained because you must because

5929.2 --> 5936.8099999999995
otherwise there's only destruction it's

5931.51 --> 5936.81
what is that you know what is that

5939.11 --> 5945.86
well I think all right so I was raised

5943.37 --> 5948.59
Catholic right I'm not religious as is

5945.86 --> 5955.37
right now in any way but I was raised

5948.59 --> 5958.25
Catholic even while I was going through

5955.37 --> 5961.099999999999
that like certain things always kind of

5958.25 --> 5963.56
bothered me about and I mean it just

5961.1 --> 5967.159000000001
about the whole is not just Catholicism

5963.56 --> 5969.29
the whole religious aspect like certain

5967.159 --> 5973.79
things would always bug me out a little

5969.29 --> 5977.51
bit like okay I'm we were supposed to go

5973.79 --> 5981.14
to church so you know pray and worship

5977.51 --> 5983.83
God and have mass and all that and there

5981.14 --> 5988.1900000000005
were points when I would ask my my

5983.83 --> 5990.05
parents like why you know if I go to

5988.19 --> 5991.909
school or I go to church and they told

5990.05 --> 5995.39
me you know God is in me and God is

5991.909 --> 5998.719
everywhere and stuff why do I have to

5995.39 --> 5999.59
get up early on Sunday to go to church

5998.719 --> 6002.11
mm-hm

5999.59 --> 6004.9490000000005
when obviously I should be able to pray

6002.11 --> 6008.679
and talk to God however I want to

6004.949 --> 6010.57
wherever I am right you know like why do

6008.679 --> 6012.61
I have to get up and now I have to put a

6010.57 --> 6015.099999999999
tie on I mean come on

6012.61 --> 6017.17
yeah the mandatory aspect that you have

6015.1 --> 6019.9890000000005
then and then you get to church and and

6017.17 --> 6022.3
this is no way knocking anybody who's

6019.989 --> 6024.218999999999
religious because you know it's just not

6022.3 --> 6025.96
my thing but these are questions that

6024.219 --> 6032.02
I've had since I was brought up in it

6025.96 --> 6034.449
you know and you know I have to you know

6032.02 --> 6036.429
we have to go to church and the priest

6034.449 --> 6040.599999999999
is giving his interpretation of the

6036.429 --> 6043.659
Bible to you you know and it's like okay

6040.6 --> 6047.4400000000005
that's cool but he's telling me what the

6043.659 --> 6049.379999999999
Bible means to him how how am I supposed

6047.44 --> 6052.599999999999
to relate that to what it means to me

6049.38 --> 6055.54
yeah because to me I see the Bible is a

6052.6 --> 6058.6
book that you know it's interpretive you

6055.54 --> 6062.26
know read it take it how you want to

6058.6 --> 6065.42
write but I think people's people take

6062.26 --> 6067.88
it a little bit too literal at times

6065.42 --> 6071.36
because I've had people tell me like if

6067.88 --> 6074.83
you don't live by the book you're going

6071.36 --> 6078.349999999999
to hell and it's like are you serious

6074.83 --> 6081.139
well so we're we're in your book that it

6078.35 --> 6082.429
tells you you tell me that right oh yeah

6081.139 --> 6084.77
that's a good thing

6082.429 --> 6087.2300000000005
like maybe saying guys come out of

6084.77 --> 6090.01
nothing it seemed it's just like a rumor

6087.23 --> 6093.799999999999
that's spread for an eternity almost but

6090.01 --> 6097.159000000001
yeah maybe you should take it let row in

6093.8 --> 6098.84
a non-literal way and that is that what

6097.159 --> 6101.719
they say without completely

6098.84 --> 6104.51
conceptualizing it themselves yeah

6101.719 --> 6106.04
this describes how to do it right and if

6104.51 --> 6110.8
you don't do it right then you go to

6106.04 --> 6114.86
hell so technically it's right but it's

6110.8 --> 6118.58
taken too literal they don't even

6114.86 --> 6119.869
realize it right so they are right but

6118.58 --> 6123.11
not in the way they think they are

6119.869 --> 6130.61
absolutely guiding your life by a book

6123.11 --> 6132.29
that was supposedly written I mean to me

6130.61 --> 6136.159
it's a bit much

6132.29 --> 6138.11
I mean it's a little much even though

6136.159 --> 6141.08
again I don't knock it because you know

6138.11 --> 6143.29
certain people they still have religious

6141.08 --> 6146.35
people in my family you know you'd say

6143.29 --> 6149.63
you take your belief in Jesus and and

6146.35 --> 6151.01
you use that as a staple to lead a good

6149.63 --> 6154.969
life and that's awesome

6151.01 --> 6157.1
you know that's the way I think that

6154.969 --> 6158.33
whatever the purpose of that book is I

6157.1 --> 6161.4490000000005
think that's what it's there for

6158.33 --> 6162.44
like that's like a fate you know I mean

6161.449 --> 6166.33
well no I

6162.44 --> 6168.83
maybe maybe people think that Jesus is

6166.33 --> 6170.75
quite possibly maybe he did I have no

6168.83 --> 6172.46
clue either way right okay well that's

6170.75 --> 6175.1
how you think about it I think that the

6172.46 --> 6178.219
Bible is an incredible multi-dimensional

6175.1 --> 6183.530000000001
book that is beyond the understanding of

6178.219 --> 6186.08
most and it can be interpreted in so

6183.53 --> 6187.82
many different ways from so many

6186.08 --> 6191.78
different angles in so many different

6187.82 --> 6195.4
knowledge sectors and for some freaking

6191.78 --> 6199.009999999999
them reason it always works even though

6195.4 --> 6201.379999999999
from a cultural perspective these differ

6199.01 --> 6203.150000000001
angles contradict each other a hundred

6201.38 --> 6206.32
eighty degrees in things that's the

6203.15 --> 6208.46
creepy thing about it so it's all rights

6206.32 --> 6213.88
even though it doesn't make any sense

6208.46 --> 6213.88
that it all works out that's the Bible

6217.0 --> 6222.769
maybe because I'm I don't follow like a

6220.849 --> 6225.619000000001
religious lifestyle anymore maybe I

6222.769 --> 6228.2300000000005
don't interpret the Bible very well but

6225.619 --> 6231.589999999999
like again for me because I was raised

6228.23 --> 6234.86
with it you know I just take out you

6231.59 --> 6237.38
know be good to others it's not really

6234.86 --> 6239.449
uh personally me I feel like I just I

6237.38 --> 6242.42
don't there's a lot that I don't need in

6239.449 --> 6244.489
that book I've got what I needed I treat

6242.42 --> 6246.559
people who kind of achieve evil the way

6244.489 --> 6249.709999999999
I want to be treated that's cool right

6246.559 --> 6251.6900000000005
well that's that's basically the most

6249.71 --> 6254.929
important thing about it and the rest is

6251.69 --> 6258.169999999999
just more stories that you could learn

6254.929 --> 6260.059
even more from or use it to try to

6258.17 --> 6262.1900000000005
figure out what was actually going on

6260.059 --> 6265.55
back there or is there some hidden

6262.19 --> 6268.839999999999
secret message that's being planted

6265.55 --> 6271.13
there for the occult eyes to find

6268.84 --> 6272.92
because I think the Bible is freaking

6271.13 --> 6277.7300000000005
full of that as well

6272.92 --> 6280.82
so it's all a matter of what angle you

6277.73 --> 6283.4
take towards the book because you can

6280.82 --> 6285.739
interpret it all in a Gnostic way and

6283.4 --> 6289.25
that all works out even though that

6285.739 --> 6295.129999999999
directly contradicts ya the other side

6289.25 --> 6297.25
to do more literalist and just all works

6295.13 --> 6301.4800000000005
all of it

6297.25 --> 6304.39
weirdly enough so far from whatever you

6301.48 --> 6306.37
know it's bad when I understand

6304.39 --> 6309.85
sometimes when people who are heavily

6306.37 --> 6311.38
religious catch a bad name and it sucks

6309.85 --> 6313.120000000001
but it's because you know there are

6311.38 --> 6317.56
certain people who would push it on

6313.12 --> 6322.54
anyway that it's like so insane you know

6317.56 --> 6326.5
I mean it's yeah the the drone ish part

6322.54 --> 6329.32
like those witnesses yeah it's there

6326.5 --> 6333.01
they're not even full spirits basically

6329.32 --> 6337.8099999999995
they're just copy pasting piece of

6333.01 --> 6339.9890000000005
writing obviously down completely on the

6337.81 --> 6342.64
servers are knocking on people's doors

6339.989 --> 6344.5599999999995
you know it means that I'm not knocking

6342.64 --> 6346.0
with anybody's door talking about a

6344.56 --> 6349.030000000001
would you like to talk about the how

6346.0 --> 6351.219
long flat Thursday don't do that you

6349.03 --> 6354.91
know pushing that [ __ ] on people

6351.219 --> 6356.26
another thing cuz you know you're

6354.91 --> 6360.84
talking people thought when you know

6356.26 --> 6365.64
what the thing is again it can be good

6360.84 --> 6369.34
but the problem is is that it's mandated

6365.64 --> 6372.67
you know look like ice I bring up Christ

6369.34 --> 6374.68
and the path in the right moment with a

6372.67 --> 6379.18
new person that's never even thought

6374.68 --> 6381.400000000001
about it or may have had some doubts and

6379.18 --> 6383.59
starting to maybe consider Christianity

6381.4 --> 6387.429999999999
but doesn't like to relate you know it's

6383.59 --> 6392.14
all about the moment and this whole rule

6387.43 --> 6392.9490000000005
system mandates that is just so out of

6392.14 --> 6396.58
whack

6392.949 --> 6400.629999999999
it's corporatized like it's enforced and

6396.58 --> 6406.09
it becomes a natural that way you know

6400.63 --> 6409.39
it becomes unspiritual comes off of of

6406.09 --> 6412.54
the world of matter and with all the

6409.39 --> 6415.81
problems that come with that so it's not

6412.54 --> 6418.3
spiritual anymore if it's all mandated

6415.81 --> 6421.63
and written in the rules and you must do

6418.3 --> 6425.1
it exactly like this and then what does

6421.63 --> 6428.1
that have to do with anything spiritual

6425.1 --> 6428.1
nothing

6429.08 --> 6436.13
and I do consider myself to be

6430.61 --> 6439.13
spiritually just not religious right and

6436.13 --> 6441.97
there is additions give me a second I

6439.13 --> 6441.97
got a new suicide

6445.18 --> 6452.860000000001
