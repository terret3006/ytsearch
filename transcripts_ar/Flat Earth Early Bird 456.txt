189.89 --> 192.25
forgot

196.15 --> 200.77
yeah all right so

209.51 --> 214.25
yesterday was a bit bit of a mixed day

211.829 --> 214.25
for me

221.36 --> 238.01000000000002
I don't know just I was on the debates

225.29 --> 240.519
and what I think and you accidentally

238.01 --> 240.51899999999998
double

254.58 --> 260.98
that's okay it happens yeah you I've

258.579 --> 262.75
been in chat as moderators when the

260.98 --> 265.69
trolls were coming for example over at

262.75 --> 268.63
Patricia's and then like three people

265.69 --> 271.06
would like at the same time try to time

268.63 --> 272.68
somebody out but it kind of land flip

271.06 --> 275.32
flop so somebody hides him somebody

272.68 --> 279.16
hands hide behind and I it's crazy how

275.32 --> 282.59999999999997
that gets so it's just technical I know

279.16 --> 285.699
you so I recognize it when that happens

282.6 --> 285.699
[Music]

285.87 --> 293.889
anyway yeah yesterday bit of mixed day I

290.65 --> 297.28
was on the debates and it was really

293.889 --> 299.56
tough for me to get a word in like it

297.28 --> 305.95
was all pretty high energy and or while

299.56 --> 311.86
high energy it was pretty like on the

305.95 --> 314.139
March as it were and yeah and you have

311.86 --> 319.12
to show I don't know if anybody caught

314.139 --> 322.66
it but like I had this I don't know this

319.12 --> 325.84000000000003
really vision type of thing that I

322.66 --> 329.41
wanted to share almost and yeah I just

325.84 --> 335.61999999999995
couldn't I got I get being put at the

329.41 --> 337.93
back of the line and yeah because of it

335.62 --> 341.039
so many times just thinks that I wanted

337.93 --> 346.81
the input they just they're just lost

341.039 --> 351.389
and and yeah many of the times it

346.81 --> 355.78000000000003
usually turns out to be tenth man and he

351.389 --> 358.03000000000003
you know he never he always opposes when

355.78 --> 360.7
I do something like that and he even

358.03 --> 364.92999999999995
into it just he's like morally against

360.7 --> 368.05
it almost it seems and I'm getting sick

364.93 --> 371.76
of it because he's literally getting in

368.05 --> 371.76
my way a lot

377.36 --> 380.48900000000003
[Music]

381.37 --> 391.719
and I don't think he cares

384.169 --> 394.34
I literally doesn't think he cares and

391.719 --> 397.84
yeah I'm wondering about the rest what

394.34 --> 402.48999999999995
they think about it but yeah it's I

397.84 --> 405.94899999999996
don't really know how to deal with it I

402.49 --> 407.569
need some room to share some things and

405.949 --> 412.509
sometimes those things can get a little

407.569 --> 415.37
complicated and then if I don't feel

412.509 --> 418.189
comfortable just being able to share

415.37 --> 420.379
more complex things then I may even

418.189 --> 422.41900000000004
falter and start to stutter start to

420.379 --> 424.72900000000004
stumble in my explanation of the other

422.419 --> 427.44899999999996
you know why that is it's not because I

424.729 --> 430.00899999999996
can't put it down it's because I

427.449 --> 434.949
basically don't feel comfortable enough

430.009 --> 437.629
because I almost feel like it's not like

434.949 --> 441.909
I'm not welcome to do that or something

437.629 --> 441.909
and then I have trouble

445.57 --> 450.49
so yeah and it's yeah that's really nice

448.06 --> 452.26
yeah I get really punny and all that

450.49 --> 454.54
sometimes too you know and that's all

452.26 --> 457.51
really nice but that's not the only

454.54 --> 463.63
thing I do that's just when I'm in a bit

457.51 --> 466.87
of a goofy mood and then I do that but I

463.63 --> 470.40999999999997
have a lot of deep thoughts as well like

466.87 --> 474.94
bigger picture things that are a lot

470.41 --> 477.87
about our intuitive sensories and I feel

474.94 --> 480.85
I need to express those sometimes and

477.87 --> 492.91
people like 10 that literally get in my

480.85 --> 496.57000000000005
way it seems like they don't care so

492.91 --> 498.70000000000005
yeah I complained about this before yeah

496.57 --> 502.54
you feel hurried that's very much more

498.7 --> 504.07
like what it is and like oh no Arwen has

502.54 --> 508.06
to talk for three minutes

504.07 --> 510.88
Oh what you have your whole early bird

508.06 --> 512.59
show to non-stop talk oh so that means

510.88 --> 518.169
you don't have to say anything any more

512.59 --> 521.86
than like what is this you know Riley

518.169 --> 525.28
and I this is just it you know I I love

521.86 --> 527.17
Riley I love the guy he has certain

525.28 --> 529.81
issues but he's like a good guy and I

527.17 --> 533.14
think I'd get him and he's very

529.81 --> 535.8399999999999
long-winded too you know he's very

533.14 --> 538.6
careful in his approach he's a bit

535.84 --> 540.94
long-winded so every time he talks it's

538.6 --> 542.97
usually pretty long well nobody's

540.94 --> 546.22
interrupting him

542.97 --> 550.45
nobody's interrupting him okay I don't

546.22 --> 553.12
and afterward it's like wow that's you

550.45 --> 555.88
know yeah we can't we may comment on it

553.12 --> 557.8
afterward but nobody's gonna then just

555.88 --> 561.34
talk over and tell him to like yeah

557.8 --> 563.3499999999999
that's enough now Riley you know that

561.34 --> 566.2
that would really trigger him and that's

563.35 --> 569.2
like that it's like personal offense and

566.2 --> 571.3900000000001
people understand that why am I being

569.2 --> 574.44
treated like I'm some second-class

571.39 --> 577.459
citizen I really feel like it sometimes

574.44 --> 581.889
like socially I can't

577.459 --> 581.8889999999999
that there's just something wrong

585.87 --> 588.99
[Music]

595.67 --> 600.17
[Music]

615.93 --> 624.87
and you have do to is like I don't

619.35 --> 628.86
really know what to do about it because

624.87 --> 632.43
I aren't already doing my best and it is

628.86 --> 636.48
provable I even share that it's like

632.43 --> 643.43
there's noticeable progress here why is

636.48 --> 643.4300000000001
this not mutual why am I still yeah

643.55 --> 648.14
handling me sloppily like this

653.77 --> 656.77
because

658.66 --> 666.88
I don't know it's also a matter of trust

662.2 --> 670.09
I think like don't don't they just trust

666.88 --> 672.13
me to have my space and have a little

670.09 --> 674.5
room to put something down that's really

672.13 --> 678.31
complicated does it put them in a bad

674.5 --> 682.17
light does it put the cause or the Black

678.31 --> 685.54
Swan in a bad like have I been negative

682.17 --> 692.8199999999999
towards any of the points in any serious

685.54 --> 692.8199999999999
way that's just wrong no no I haven't

695.58 --> 701.23
sometimes to me it almost feels like I

698.11 --> 705.64
am part of like this weird political

701.23 --> 708.63
party like that but yeah I can still go

705.64 --> 711.61
with all the points it's good enough and

708.63 --> 714.46
there is room for improvement and all

711.61 --> 717.64
that so it like it's sensible to go with

714.46 --> 719.23
that and I treat it like yeah take the

717.64 --> 724.05
group the stance and all that very

719.23 --> 724.0500000000001
seriously but

726.25 --> 733.64
yep why am I not I'm when why do I feel

731.18 --> 736.2099999999999
like I'm getting the back seat a lot of

733.64 --> 736.21
the time now

740.22 --> 743.519
[Music]

745.149 --> 750.279
ace McLeod ad no no topic in specific

748.66 --> 754.48
today I just had some things to get off

750.279 --> 756.87
my chest because I just feel really bad

754.48 --> 756.87
about it

765.14 --> 773.29
now that but don't don't get pissed

770.24 --> 781.34
how dare do you pronounce that name

773.29 --> 784.2099999999999
quick dum-dum quick stop for anyway I am

781.34 --> 787.76
basically already conformed to the group

784.21 --> 790.22
but I'm not I can't keep that up if I'm

787.76 --> 792.76
gonna be designated socially the

790.22 --> 796.9300000000001
energy-wise into a back seat position

792.76 --> 796.93
that's not my position

801.15 --> 807.72
it's unacceptable although I'll

805.32 --> 809.7900000000001
definitely take second seat to Nathan of

807.72 --> 813.35
course you know and he claims a lot of

809.79 --> 816.48
the space and it's I give it to him

813.35 --> 828.66
sometimes I think that even I accept it

816.48 --> 838.44
better than some other panelists its

828.66 --> 841.0799999999999
McLeod ah well yes but the thing is ace

838.44 --> 845.49
McLeod I have a wood yeah I can deal

841.08 --> 849.36
with it because I don't know I see the

845.49 --> 852.9300000000001
humor of it it is it is very odd to me

849.36 --> 855.54
the whole I really take it with a big

852.93 --> 858.029
scoop when you were all of everything

855.54 --> 864.779
that's going on and you know why why I

858.029 --> 868.31
can't because I have been the Zanic I

864.779 --> 872.16
have been the unorthodox literally I I

868.31 --> 874.2299999999999
can feel so much what they're doing even

872.16 --> 878.67
as they're doing it because of my mind

874.23 --> 883.35
was there in a way and I just it's just

878.67 --> 886.4699999999999
insanely funny to me so that kind of

883.35 --> 890.4200000000001
saves the frequency issue I transform it

886.47 --> 890.4200000000001
because I experienced it

894.07 --> 906.22
and in a way I wish I I had a Nathan

901.36 --> 909.67
Oakley the kinda hammer on me back in

906.22 --> 912.25
the day like ten years ago there

909.67 --> 915.13
probably were some people sort of like

912.25 --> 917.47
that but nothing like this nothing like

915.13 --> 917.889
just a constant thing that is there to

917.47 --> 922.779
do that

917.889 --> 924.91
on the internet because I would have

922.779 --> 929.35
probably snapped out of the whole

924.91 --> 931.899
situation a lot quicker that way it is

929.35 --> 934.779
really people also letting you stay in

931.899 --> 937.06
your dream and in even when they

934.779 --> 939.899
probably shouldn't like they they dare

937.06 --> 942.3699999999999
not risk breaking it open

939.899 --> 944.319
especially when it's a person with that

942.37 --> 946.149
is kind of complex like me that's very

944.319 --> 947.949
condensed because then they don't know

946.149 --> 951.04
what might come out of it so they kind

947.949 --> 954.37
of like oh stay away from that well yeah

951.04 --> 959.199
that makes me just wander around in in

954.37 --> 964.389
my mistakes a lot so in a way yeah I

959.199 --> 967.029
wish that I would have been the the

964.389 --> 971.35
baller back then to a flatter debates

967.029 --> 973.899
and and got slapped to the face with all

971.35 --> 976.1800000000001
these real arguments and then basically

973.899 --> 980.079
have done what I have already kind of

976.18 --> 982.449
done in little bits in my own way try to

980.079 --> 985.899
figure it out like I I really tried to

982.449 --> 988.899
take gravity for example and I did a

985.899 --> 991.329
pretty damn good job I'd say damn good

988.899 --> 993.94
job probably one of the best baller

991.329 --> 997.54
defense performances ever that was very

993.94 --> 999.5790000000001
serious Oh baller before it's not even

997.54 --> 1002.519
baller it's just an element of it and

999.579 --> 1004.3499999999999
because I can do that and back in the

1002.519 --> 1010.47
day I would have I would have been the

1004.35 --> 1012.48
best baller ever but it would also be it

1010.47 --> 1014.85
wouldn't take too long before I would

1012.48 --> 1017.009
probably find the Kerch because there

1014.85 --> 1021.38
would be people I could share it with I

1017.009 --> 1025.14
would probably then transform into a

1021.38 --> 1026.13
like an on defense person like I just

1025.14 --> 1030.5590000000002
don't know

1026.13 --> 1032.88
I wouldn't hang around and just

1030.559 --> 1036.539
regurgitate the same nonsense over and

1032.88 --> 1038.4
over again that's not like me the time I

1036.539 --> 1040.77
spend on that frequency would be

1038.4 --> 1045.959
relatively short but I would go through

1040.77 --> 1048.299
all the phases so yeah in that way to me

1045.959 --> 1052.89
sitting there and just here Nathan

1048.299 --> 1061.799
ramming on individuals like bread and an

1052.89 --> 1066.539
Orthodox and all that I yeah I I get

1061.799 --> 1069.33
something out of it more than just

1066.539 --> 1071.73
having to sit through negativity and hey

1069.33 --> 1076.799
if it's really that bad then I'll

1071.73 --> 1079.94
usually just leave if it's getting

1076.799 --> 1079.94
really unreasonable

1086.72 --> 1090.66
[Music]

1092.08 --> 1097.519
all right well so yeah by the way yeah

1095.45 --> 1104.779
thank you for the reminder if the chat

1097.519 --> 1109.8990000000001
tiny mumble what is it I had a good

1104.779 --> 1117.2
conversation right with Brian afterward

1109.899 --> 1119.5089999999998
was it yeah it was after the after-show

1117.2 --> 1123.1390000000001
was over and everybody pretty much left

1119.509 --> 1125.089
I stuck to talk with Brian at a very

1123.139 --> 1131.019
elaborate conversation that was pretty

1125.089 --> 1136.869
damn awesome because I basically yeah

1131.019 --> 1140.989
Brian is a remarkably spiritual person

1136.869 --> 1146.089
he's like very careful and sensitive if

1140.989 --> 1148.009
he needs to be and that's like afterward

1146.089 --> 1150.9189999999999
he kind of stepped to me and like

1148.009 --> 1154.7
basically put it down very carefully

1150.919 --> 1157.8490000000002
like what happened and and then

1154.7 --> 1160.429
proceeded to make room for me to

1157.849 --> 1162.32
actually put down the idea in all its

1160.429 --> 1165.529
glory to somebody that could actually

1162.32 --> 1167.6899999999998
hear it and we went through it had like

1165.529 --> 1170.659
conversation for half an hour at least

1167.69 --> 1173.71
and was awesome and I would love to have

1170.659 --> 1177.229
that guy on my show sometime he also

1173.71 --> 1179.509
forwarded an idea that I should quit the

1177.229 --> 1181.249
early bird show and do a show after the

1179.509 --> 1186.08
flat earth debates goes through the

1181.249 --> 1188.69
timeslot and I kind of disagreed with

1186.08 --> 1191.509
that because of yeah this time slot it

1188.69 --> 1193.789
is this time slot it is kind of the

1191.509 --> 1197.1490000000001
persistence thing I need to keep it's

1193.789 --> 1200.049
just chosen I have to somehow deal with

1197.149 --> 1205.369
it because once I break it it's like it

1200.049 --> 1207.9189999999999
yeah you can't really unbreak it anymore

1205.369 --> 1210.6599999999999
then everything is gonna change so you

1207.919 --> 1212.88
can't get the same momentum problem

1210.66 --> 1216.8700000000001
like I'm now sort of in a thing and I

1212.88 --> 1223.0200000000002
want to keep it up as much as as well as

1216.87 --> 1232.7399999999998
possible so you have no steady other

1223.02 --> 1236.18
show on another timeslot just yet but of

1232.74 --> 1236.18
course I will be part of all the shows

1261.14 --> 1266.0300000000002
yeah coming Casa Gilmore I know it is

1263.84 --> 1270.4399999999998
all very about the Black Swan nowadays

1266.03 --> 1272.96
and for me personally it's getting a bit

1270.44 --> 1276.41
old but I understand that the necessity

1272.96 --> 1279.88
because it is not about getting it

1276.41 --> 1284.21
quickly it is about for the people that

1279.88 --> 1286.13
are kind of more dense to get through to

1284.21 --> 1289.28
them because it is a wider point that

1286.13 --> 1291.2
needs to be wider understood and I told

1289.28 --> 1295.25
it so in a way it is like a positive

1291.2 --> 1298.7
siop it's very important that a lot of

1295.25 --> 1304.43
people get this not just the Flat Earth

1298.7 --> 1307.5800000000002
debaters so I understand but to me

1304.43 --> 1311.15
personally it's a bit tiresome yeah and

1307.58 --> 1313.6
that causes me to get a little bit more

1311.15 --> 1316.8700000000001
dreamy and get very dreamy ideas at time

1313.6 --> 1316.87
at times

1345.0 --> 1353.82
yeah bait well bait and bait 60 RMC look

1349.4 --> 1358.02
there's two very two distinct sides of

1353.82 --> 1360.99
Kiwi one is his intellectual is

1358.02 --> 1363.26
intellect and will end his knowledge and

1360.99 --> 1367.289
his insights and its historical

1363.26 --> 1369.57
everything and oh yeah I damn damn well

1367.289 --> 1372.99
respect that part absolutely

1369.57 --> 1377.3999999999999
it's like a sage a little bit but then

1372.99 --> 1380.85
there is the social side and yeah I safe

1377.4 --> 1384.45
to say I don't respect him what'd he get

1380.85 --> 1387.4189999999999
when he's like that I rather prefer to

1384.45 --> 1389.01
treat him like a very very rowdy dog and

1387.419 --> 1392.8500000000001
sometimes she gotta get rough to get

1389.01 --> 1401.4
through them so but that's just Kiwi

1392.85 --> 1406.62
it's very yeah I'd say very polarized

1401.4 --> 1409.95
opposites in one but yeah so it's I

1406.62 --> 1412.3799999999999
agree I it's often when he does come on

1409.95 --> 1417.3500000000001
he just gets loud and starts yelling at

1412.38 --> 1417.3500000000001
people and that's kind of annoying but

1417.95 --> 1427.0800000000002
it's a learning process I guess also for

1423.78 --> 1430.289
Nathan in like how far did does he let

1427.08 --> 1433.3799999999999
him do that like because Nathan doesn't

1430.289 --> 1440.34
want his show to just get baseline runes

1433.38 --> 1445.98
like that anyway Q he needs Whedon this

1440.34 --> 1449.48
I don't know man maybe does I don't know

1445.98 --> 1449.48
[Music]

1450.66 --> 1457.5700000000002
no but it's all useless it's useless to

1454.0 --> 1460.54
tell him what he should be doing he's

1457.57 --> 1468.07
obviously being driven by these impulses

1460.54 --> 1470.68
and he does not have any desire truly to

1468.07 --> 1472.96
control them he leaves it to moments

1470.68 --> 1475.96
where suddenly he just gets it he just

1472.96 --> 1478.21
does not have his a as steady a grip on

1475.96 --> 1483.3
his own feelings as most people do I

1478.21 --> 1486.8500000000001
think so it's just gonna be a whirlwind

1483.3 --> 1489.52
and that's just the way it is like

1486.85 --> 1493.33
really he that's not just the show

1489.52 --> 1502.15
that's off air it's always like that

1493.33 --> 1505.36
it's just a loud loud person emotionally

1502.15 --> 1511.65
immature well yeah there's you could

1505.36 --> 1511.6499999999999
argue for that yeah Prozac no-nonsense

1515.12 --> 1520.9189999999999
No and also yeah any type of freaking

1518.73 --> 1523.14
medication you're gonna dump on top of

1520.919 --> 1525.72
all that to try to stave these social

1523.14 --> 1527.4
symptoms it's gonna damage the intellect

1525.72 --> 1530.33
parts I know this from personal

1527.4 --> 1530.3300000000002
experience

1530.539 --> 1540.48
so no should definitely not be taking

1534.48 --> 1550.14
things like Prozac and I don't think he

1540.48 --> 1551.0
is anyway just just just John will be

1550.14 --> 1554.13
John

1551.0 --> 1565.13
Nathan will be Nathan Diane Arwen will

1554.13 --> 1565.13
be our win yeah right

1565.8 --> 1575.2
No now I'm going to assume now they make

1571.05 --> 1577.96
actual points that are very to the point

1575.2 --> 1581.41
and then they're ignored and then they

1577.96 --> 1583.18
get very pissed off because it happens

1581.41 --> 1585.88
every single time it happens so

1583.18 --> 1589.1200000000001
persistently that it's like a cognitive

1585.88 --> 1593.0500000000002
dissonance spell being cast by the other

1589.12 --> 1596.83
side by the ballers - on purpose be able

1593.05 --> 1598.72
to misinterpret what they're doing to

1596.83 --> 1601.4199999999998
just point at the loud part and to

1598.72 --> 1604.24
ignore the actual argument from which

1601.42 --> 1607.72
the loudness and the ignoring they're

1604.24 --> 1608.49
off has spawned that's exactly what

1607.72 --> 1624.34
happens

1608.49 --> 1633.52
so the flatter debates now there's still

1624.34 --> 1635.9099999999999
great but yeah there are still some

1633.52 --> 1635.91
issues

1640.97 --> 1647.6000000000001
and did anybody see a wooden Benjamin's

1644.69 --> 1654.2
book-burning yesterday that was just

1647.6 --> 1657.25
hilarious it's ridiculous like a

1654.2 --> 1662.72
pseudoscience book and and even with the

1657.25 --> 1665.42
the like the early racial plan condition

1662.72 --> 1669.14
it was so full of chock full of social

1665.42 --> 1671.6000000000001
engineering what he showed and then like

1669.14 --> 1676.8500000000001
burn every page it was pretty amazing to

1671.6 --> 1680.36
behold anyways yeah it was pretty late

1676.85 --> 1691.4199999999998
but I got a big part of that before I

1680.36 --> 1691.4199999999998
went to bed it's all about geology and

1695.59 --> 1700.87
it was mostly about geology and fossils

1698.379 --> 1706.6789999999999
and dinosaurs and stuff like for kids

1700.87 --> 1709.87
and yeah it was just amazing the the the

1706.679 --> 1712.769
the programming that was in there very

1709.87 --> 1712.7689999999998
obvious now

1742.81 --> 1747.1299999999999
[Music]

1764.759 --> 1768.43
yeah

1767.25 --> 1772.87
[Music]

1768.43 --> 1772.8700000000001
that's oops

1778.46 --> 1781.569
[Music]

1785.19 --> 1794.909
right yeah start talking again I just

1792.57 --> 1797.639
don't want to talk about other people

1794.909 --> 1800.729
all the time you know it it probably

1797.639 --> 1805.559
gets on peoples nerves I need to get

1800.729 --> 1808.95
some subject although yeah you guys are

1805.559 --> 1810.9289999999999
talking about it so yeah okay I guess

1808.95 --> 1813.45
you guys constantly want to bicker on

1810.929 --> 1815.489
about it as well that's by the way Thank

1813.45 --> 1819.44
You Sean Tibet's for the two final

1815.489 --> 1823.289
superjet donation it's a cool pair

1819.44 --> 1829.799
Thanks thanks for that light is

1823.289 --> 1832.32
instantaneous no not really I guess I'll

1829.799 --> 1839.9089999999999
have to show you the video that actually

1832.32 --> 1841.279
proves that it's not instantaneous hold

1839.909 --> 1845.6290000000001
on

1841.279 --> 1845.629
at first I need to find it

1849.52 --> 1852.539
[Music]

1871.44 --> 1874.88
ah there it is

1875.57 --> 1878.1689999999999
hi

1882.7 --> 1895.3890000000001
all right let's see how I'm gonna I

1885.969 --> 1895.3890000000001
don't know how do I do that no dear

1902.56 --> 1905.7
[Music]

1927.29 --> 1932.78
all right let's see never that doesn't

1931.1 --> 1936.01
work

1932.78 --> 1936.01
[Music]

1940.98 --> 1951.8990000000001
ha that does work I do I did cheat

1945.389 --> 1955.26
though cool right

1951.899 --> 1961.4399999999998
uh okay well here's that video

1955.26 --> 1963.99
oh dear it's 26 minutes in today's video

1961.44 --> 1966.409
I will conduct an experiment of the

1963.99 --> 1969.45
direct measurement of the speed of light

1966.409 --> 1970.6490000000001
as I mentioned in my previous blog post

1969.45 --> 1973.789
in last week

1970.649 --> 1977.4189999999999
which I will link it down below right

1973.789 --> 1981.33
yeah that's gonna be a lot of intro talk

1977.419 --> 1989.519
obviously but he's basically using

1981.33 --> 1993.4499999999998
electronics and light sensors to very

1989.519 --> 2001.99
carefully yeah so that you have an

1993.45 --> 2001.99
effective you'll see it right so this is

2002.37 --> 2006.84
so now I turn out the light actually you

2005.01 --> 2010.23
can see this well actually it doesn't

2006.84 --> 2012.99
quite come out as well as I thought it

2010.23 --> 2015.419
would be but you can only see the silks

2012.99 --> 2017.85
called oscilloscope now nothing else but

2015.419 --> 2021.2990000000002
anyway so right now hopefully you can

2017.85 --> 2025.529
see my pointer the upper one again is

2021.299 --> 2028.1689999999999
the laser generated from the pulse

2025.529 --> 2031.559
generator and the lower one is that

2028.169 --> 2033.2990000000002
received pause you can see that the the

2031.559 --> 2035.9089999999999
slope here that's where the

2033.299 --> 2041.69
photomultiplier decide attacks the

2035.909 --> 2044.97
signal and so we gonna use this as our

2041.69 --> 2048.33
you know the fixed reference because

2044.97 --> 2051.27
right now the delay is actually caused

2048.33 --> 2055.56
by either the circuit or I mean the

2051.27 --> 2059.0099999999998
circuit plus my the distance between the

2055.56 --> 2062.31
mirror and the both multiplier so we

2059.01 --> 2064.4700000000003
will actually record that as a you know

2062.31 --> 2067.919
our starting point so right now as you

2064.47 --> 2070.6189999999997
can see the delay is roughly twenty

2067.919 --> 2073.3489999999997
point four five nanoseconds so I'll

2070.619 --> 2076.02
write that down and we will take a look

2073.349 --> 2081.78
did you get that ten twenty point forty

2076.02 --> 2085.8
five nanoseconds yeah it's not a lot of

2081.78 --> 2087.51
time but it is doable this guy is like

2085.8 --> 2090.7200000000003
if you watch the whole video is so

2087.51 --> 2094.5
careful like this guy is this is not

2090.72 --> 2098.7599999999998
some techno babbling idiot this guy's

2094.5 --> 2101.49
really knows and puts down exactly how

2098.76 --> 2105.75
it works it feels like I'm listening to

2101.49 --> 2108.1699999999996
my brother at that level so yeah this is

2105.75 --> 2111.93
way beyond the electronics and all that

2108.17 --> 2114.599
but he knows what is doing in pretty

2111.93 --> 2116.6699999999996
damn sure of it

2114.599 --> 2119.79
right so he's basically showing the

2116.67 --> 2121.65
whole device even excited yes like so

2119.79 --> 2124.56
you could do this yourself if you were a

2121.65 --> 2128.48
bit of an electronics guy alright so

2124.56 --> 2132.43
let's get to the normal more actual

2128.48 --> 2136.66
video where he's where is it

2132.43 --> 2136.66
did I skip it

2139.56 --> 2142.43
or is it

2144.33 --> 2154.83
when he actually does it I only see the

2147.75 --> 2157.01
oppor always miss it right and that was

2154.83 --> 2157.0099999999998
it

2159.83 --> 2165.67
where's the part where is actually

2161.57 --> 2165.67
testing it it is it

2169.99 --> 2173.4599999999996
must have skipped over it

2178.15 --> 2181.779
gotten it more mess

2188.67 --> 2193.71
no this is all this where is that part

2191.69 --> 2197.51
actually does it

2193.71 --> 2197.51
what was it all at the beginning ah

2197.579 --> 2206.46
anyway this is a it's a pretty good

2202.74 --> 2208.2889999999998
video I think I showed it at some time

2206.46 --> 2210.96
ago so I downloaded it to my computer

2208.289 --> 2218.2200000000003
because I thought this is like I need to

2210.96 --> 2221.609
have this alright so yeah I'm pretty

2218.22 --> 2223.799
sure light has a speed its measured and

2221.609 --> 2228.17
it's like even you can vary and

2223.799 --> 2228.17
manipulate the independent variable or

2230.69 --> 2237.51
Li you can change the distance and then

2234.17 --> 2239.94
interactively yeah not was talked about

2237.51 --> 2243.059
so but you can change the the distance

2239.94 --> 2244.71
and therefore the this the total amount

2243.059 --> 2247.94
of time that is gonna take for the light

2244.71 --> 2252.299
to they get there and that's measurable

2247.94 --> 2253.98
interactively and I thought it was in

2252.299 --> 2256.319
this video but I might have to watch it

2253.98 --> 2259.309
back to pinpoint exactly at what point

2256.319 --> 2259.3089999999997
that was shown

2266.0 --> 2270.47
can't be serious can be I

2274.02 --> 2277.159
[Music]

2295.47 --> 2298.89
but it's measurable the speed is

2298.14 --> 2303.24
measurable

2298.89 --> 2305.2799999999997
Karen B how can you say that the rate of

2303.24 --> 2308.31
induction no it's a speed

2305.28 --> 2310.2200000000003
it's a measurable speed and doesn't

2308.31 --> 2313.68
matter what the nature of its

2310.22 --> 2318.1189999999997
transversing is induction whatever it is

2313.68 --> 2323.069
not instantaneous so it has a speed the

2318.119 --> 2326.579
[ __ ] yes yes it does from one point to

2323.069 --> 2329.359
the other it says the speed if you

2326.579 --> 2332.3100000000004
change the distance then the speed also

2329.359 --> 2335.609
changes like in order to speed itself

2332.31 --> 2336.81
but just the time it takes changes so

2335.609 --> 2339.94
yes

2336.81 --> 2339.94
[Music]

2355.54 --> 2364.54
or can be in this video I just shared it

2361.33 --> 2372.04
shows exactly how to measure it

2364.54 --> 2374.59
with a light and a sensor of light it's

2372.04 --> 2377.47
no but that's it doesn't matter what you

2374.59 --> 2380.71
call it what you call the foundational

2377.47 --> 2383.2599999999998
nature of its appearance it is literally

2380.71 --> 2389.35
a speed it is from one point to the

2383.26 --> 2392.4
other speed you can call it the the whoo

2389.35 --> 2395.62
bleep ah bleep hour or whatever or

2392.4 --> 2397.12
extra-dimensional instantaneousness it

2395.62 --> 2400.54
doesn't really matter what you call it

2397.12 --> 2403.2599999999998
it has a speed measurably carrot V don't

2400.54 --> 2403.2599999999998
be ridiculous

2403.41 --> 2414.46
calling it a rate of induction does not

2406.33 --> 2416.5299999999997
take away that it has a speed oh it

2414.46 --> 2418.33
doesn't travel propagates Wow

2416.53 --> 2423.7200000000003
sounds like you're trying to build a

2418.33 --> 2427.63
whole alternative narration to bypass

2423.72 --> 2430.06
real-world problems here well just

2427.63 --> 2434.13
giving it other types of words is not

2430.06 --> 2441.43
gonna undo that it has a speed

2434.13 --> 2444.21
measurably so Karen be no lol the [ __ ]

2441.43 --> 2444.21
is wrong with you

2455.22 --> 2464.4399999999996
yeah wah let's measure it

2461.01 --> 2466.48
well don't be don't go caps on me then

2464.44 --> 2473.559
and start making these ridiculous

2466.48 --> 2474.97
statements oh okay we're just talking

2473.559 --> 2478.9
alright what I pay a lot of attention

2474.97 --> 2479.3799999999997
and if people are gonna say things like

2478.9 --> 2483.609
that

2479.38 --> 2485.9700000000003
then I will will respond to it very

2483.609 --> 2490.0589999999997
passionately especially because this is

2485.97 --> 2491.14
this is my field I'm pretty certain of

2490.059 --> 2493.9900000000002
what I'm saying

2491.14 --> 2496.1189999999997
light has a speed and it doesn't matter

2493.99 --> 2497.589
what you're gonna call it or if what

2496.119 --> 2500.799
you're gonna call the speed or the

2497.589 --> 2504.8089999999997
travel or the way it manifests matter

2500.799 --> 2515.079
what you're gonna call it it has a speed

2504.809 --> 2517.69
you can't get away from it you can call

2515.079 --> 2522.309
me getting triggered but I don't know

2517.69 --> 2524.559
you're the way you try to insert how it

2522.309 --> 2526.4500000000003
does not have a speed and then proceed

2524.559 --> 2529.329
to take all these words that I'm using

2526.45 --> 2531.6699999999996
and then saying no it has this basically

2529.329 --> 2534.4
using another word exactly for the same

2531.67 --> 2538.4500000000003
thing pretty much to try to win the arc

2534.4 --> 2540.13
well sounds like very defensive I don't

2538.45 --> 2544.089
think that I'm really the one being

2540.13 --> 2546.339
triggered about just saying that light

2544.089 --> 2548.349
has a speed measurably so and I even

2546.339 --> 2552.66
showed the video of a guy pretty much

2548.349 --> 2555.6600000000003
doing it and how and even what he built

2552.66 --> 2555.66
so

2557.03 --> 2565.02
it doesn't matter if what the speed of

2560.49 --> 2568.1699999999996
induction is or the speed of the

2565.02 --> 2570.27
traveling it has a speed and if you vary

2568.17 --> 2572.04
the distance the time it takes to go

2570.27 --> 2574.11
there you go it grows longer and that's

2572.04 --> 2576.69
how you measure that it does indeed have

2574.11 --> 2579.65
a speed so it has a speed doesn't really

2576.69 --> 2579.65
matter what you call it

2586.28 --> 2589.409
[Music]

2592.82 --> 2598.8500000000004
how really is it Karen B it's taking the

2596.93 --> 2604.7
energy and converting it to a unit

2598.85 --> 2608.15
really that sounds like a straw man what

2604.7 --> 2611.18
was I talking about a unit now I wasn't

2608.15 --> 2617.21
talking about something having a speed

2611.18 --> 2622.5499999999997
moving from one place to another it's

2617.21 --> 2626.06
not talking about a unit are you

2622.55 --> 2629.1200000000003
addressing fill Bell here oh god yes you

2626.06 --> 2630.98
were right okay sorry it's not your

2629.12 --> 2639.2599999999998
argument I get it

2630.98 --> 2641.9900000000002
I feel Bell look it's well it's pretty

2639.26 --> 2645.0800000000004
much the same thing that even a QE says

2641.99 --> 2649.6699999999996
okay so yeah everybody's up and divided

2645.08 --> 2652.34
about this guess what because people 80

2649.67 --> 2655.34
years ago that started to delve in this

2652.34 --> 2657.8900000000003
either didn't get it or they figured out

2655.34 --> 2660.53
this is too dangerous or they figured

2657.89 --> 2662.69
out yeah we can't openly put this out

2660.53 --> 2667.19
because people can handle it so let's

2662.69 --> 2671.09
just throw in an eternal physicality

2667.19 --> 2674.06
assumption based false dichotomy duality

2671.09 --> 2677.4500000000003
in science and call it the particle wave

2674.06 --> 2680.65
duality issue that people will fight

2677.45 --> 2683.93
over for a hundred years

2680.65 --> 2686.96
mmm delicious everybody's divided about

2683.93 --> 2688.94
this everybody because one thing is

2686.96 --> 2691.25
exactly the opposite of the other yet

2688.94 --> 2693.53
they have both elements so one party

2691.25 --> 2696.2
that's very much unto one side will

2693.53 --> 2698.3
exclude factor from the other side give

2696.2 --> 2701.18
it another spin give it their side to it

2698.3 --> 2704.78
that'll allow them to explain everything

2701.18 --> 2707.0
from their point of view from their side

2704.78 --> 2709.82
from their polarised false dichotomy

2707.0 --> 2712.28
side and the other side does exactly the

2709.82 --> 2716.42
same thing in another structure it's

2712.28 --> 2718.3100000000004
like two almost symmetrical spirals just

2716.42 --> 2721.88
never reaching one another because

2718.31 --> 2724.0099999999998
they're both wrong and they don't get it

2721.88 --> 2726.5
they get polarized almost like it almost

2724.01 --> 2732.8300000000004
like politics this is like a

2726.5 --> 2735.38
political issue of physics yeah that's

2732.83 --> 2737.99
what this is and everybody falls for it

2735.38 --> 2753.23
ballers flat-earthers doesn't matter

2737.99 --> 2756.74
everyone falls for this [ __ ] waver light

2753.23 --> 2760.07
waver life light particle I had a

2756.74 --> 2765.3999999999996
mentally particle I particle list it's

2760.07 --> 2768.26
nonsense it's all very very wrong and

2765.4 --> 2769.94
none of you can handle it I'm just going

2768.26 --> 2774.2000000000003
with the actual data

2769.94 --> 2777.41
I like tangible things and then let all

2774.2 --> 2781.8399999999997
the people all see the tangible data and

2777.41 --> 2786.02
things and look at the inevitable

2781.84 --> 2788.57
consequences I'm just gonna look at the

2786.02 --> 2790.85
data and then look at some more data and

2788.57 --> 2793.9100000000003
then look at some more data and the more

2790.85 --> 2795.74
conflicting the better cuz I might still

2793.91 --> 2799.1299999999997
start to see a certain pattern that

2795.74 --> 2802.0099999999998
everybody just look at the existential

2799.13 --> 2804.92
consequences that all get distracted by

2802.01 --> 2807.5800000000004
that nonsense have not seen that's what

2804.92 --> 2807.58
I'm here to do

2851.7 --> 2855.47
what are you talking about

2858.27 --> 2865.61
I don't care flood is taste pancake

2885.68 --> 2888.87
[Music]

2899.299 --> 2905.959
well look I'm pretty sure that people

2902.839 --> 2909.439
are aware of who rent is and how he does

2905.959 --> 2920.3289999999997
things and everything so thanks but

2909.439 --> 2923.0589999999997
that's really kind of useless if there's

2920.329 --> 2925.9990000000003
some actual real scam going on then

2923.059 --> 2928.579
there will be people that have proof of

2925.999 --> 2930.709
that because they are victimized and

2928.579 --> 2934.009
that will come forward one way or the

2930.709 --> 2938.959
other so this sounds kind of like a bit

2934.009 --> 2941.829
of a stupid troll rumor so let's just

2938.959 --> 2941.8289999999997
get you out of here

2954.84 --> 2960.079
[Music]

2973.04 --> 2979.72
right

2975.22 --> 2982.48
well Scott random to say that there is a

2979.72 --> 2985.75
fixed speed of light that is where you

2982.48 --> 2988.51
would probably go wrong in my opinion

2985.75 --> 2991.27
but it definitely can be established

2988.51 --> 2994.3
that light has a speed

2991.27 --> 3001.29
now how uniform that speed of the light

2994.3 --> 3004.4700000000003
is that's another matter there's in my

3001.29 --> 3011.64
personal view more to be figured out in

3004.47 --> 3013.5
detail I think that the conceptual

3011.64 --> 3015.45
oversight that has been handed to us

3013.5 --> 3019.25
about what light supposed to be and how

3015.45 --> 3019.25
it works is pretty limited

3034.71 --> 3045.27
yeah I know professor Phil Bell energy

3040.75 --> 3048.93
is absorbed it changes something and

3045.27 --> 3051.22
then an electron is released yeah and

3048.93 --> 3052.8399999999997
but it's always gonna be matter bound

3051.22 --> 3056.2
you know it doesn't prove anything about

3052.84 --> 3058.6000000000004
any unit it doesn't prove particles at

3056.2 --> 3063.1299999999997
all because if you're gonna base your

3058.6 --> 3067.0299999999997
readings your minimal if you're gonna

3063.13 --> 3069.1600000000003
try to establish the minimal size of

3067.03 --> 3072.82
something and base your measurement

3069.16 --> 3076.21
readings upon matter a metal plate right

3072.82 --> 3081.6090000000004
metal molecules or atoms right right

3076.21 --> 3083.89
okay what's gonna happen is that it's

3081.609 --> 3087.34
gone lights gonna be on that on that

3083.89 --> 3089.41
matter right and then any reaction

3087.34 --> 3095.07
that's gonna transpire is gonna be

3089.41 --> 3097.8689999999997
dependent on the minimum switch rate

3095.07 --> 3100.7200000000003
critical mass of energy a single

3097.869 --> 3104.59
molecule even requires of the light of

3100.72 --> 3107.91
that specific combined light in order to

3104.59 --> 3110.77
switch around and release that electron

3107.91 --> 3113.92
so it's gonna be matter bound that is

3110.77 --> 3116.65
how they originally kind of arbitrarily

3113.92 --> 3119.14
set the point of what is the minimum

3116.65 --> 3122.71
quanta of light it's basically based

3119.14 --> 3127.5099999999998
upon what is the minimum amount of light

3122.71 --> 3131.89
energy that is required for a molecule

3127.51 --> 3135.46
or an atom to have that specific effect

3131.89 --> 3139.5099999999998
the threshold of that effect was kind of

3135.46 --> 3141.609
used to supposedly claim the minimum

3139.51 --> 3144.13
amount of light because if it was lower

3141.609 --> 3146.77
then that reaction wouldn't take place

3144.13 --> 3151.15
but that doesn't mean that light is a

3146.77 --> 3154.05
particle like matter at all it's like a

3151.15 --> 3154.05
false assumption

3166.57 --> 3173.86
I think light definitely has a speed but

3169.45 --> 3178.56
it is also infinitely divisible there is

3173.86 --> 3181.56
no minimum unit it's it can spread out

3178.56 --> 3181.56
eternally

3202.72 --> 3204.75
ah

3209.999 --> 3215.979
that's funny you say that professor Phil

3212.829 --> 3218.0190000000002
Bell because a ring laser gyro does not

3215.979 --> 3223.3289999999997
rely on the speed of light it relies on

3218.019 --> 3233.6189999999997
the speed of light that is used in the

3223.329 --> 3236.0190000000002
device speed of that light alright

3233.619 --> 3238.569
anyway I'm gonna round out the show so

3236.019 --> 3245.4689999999996
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3238.569 --> 3249.43
like to show a lot of rumour talk a lot

3245.469 --> 3251.44
of social talk what's going down on the

3249.43 --> 3253.4199999999996
internet and the Flat Earth debates and

3251.44 --> 3257.43
blah blah blah blah and the individuals

3253.42 --> 3259.7490000000003
and who all the infighting oh goody I

3257.43 --> 3262.779
prefer talking about this stuff though

3259.749 --> 3264.64
where the show ended up is seriously

3262.779 --> 3266.559
rather to talk about electronics and

3264.64 --> 3269.16
just the mysterious nature of light and

3266.559 --> 3271.4790000000003
all the data concerning it and just

3269.16 --> 3273.93
everybody breaking their heads over that

3271.479 --> 3276.8089999999997
I prefer that than just talking about

3273.93 --> 3279.64
individuals all day long

3276.809 --> 3281.289
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

3279.64 --> 3284.049
you like to show if you did then please

3281.289 --> 3285.4
don't forget there Rogen's up and if you

3284.049 --> 3287.199
haven't already subscribed to my channel

3285.4 --> 3288.609
hit the bell notification so you know

3287.199 --> 3290.559
when I'm going live which is normally

3288.609 --> 3293.589
2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every day

3290.559 --> 3295.42
please also do support me for the paypal

3293.589 --> 3298.479
patron my GoFundMe and the super jet

3295.42 --> 3300.4590000000003
that will be much appreciated I'll be

3298.479 --> 3305.979
back tomorrow with flattered early bird

3300.459 --> 3307.1189999999997
number 457 Saturday edition and I'm just

3305.979 --> 3309.4199999999996
going to join the Flat Earth debates

3307.119 --> 3313.449
right after this it just started up so

3309.42 --> 3318.339
yeah go there after the show ends the

3313.449 --> 3323.4590000000003
hashtag meifa indeed over Mukul yeah

3318.339 --> 3323.459
until the next video keep it flat

3324.65 --> 3347.579
[Music]

3350.25 --> 3352.31
you
