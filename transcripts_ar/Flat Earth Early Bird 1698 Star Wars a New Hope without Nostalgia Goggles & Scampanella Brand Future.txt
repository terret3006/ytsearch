all that right so the weather today is

106.74 --> 109.88
absolutely gorgeous

114.119 --> 119.159
it's not pristine Blue Sky it was

116.22 --> 121.14
earlier there are some clouds around

119.159 --> 122.93900000000001
but it's because there's just a lot of

121.14 --> 125.64
moist in the air during this heat wave

122.939 --> 128.459
the little Heat Wave it's not really

125.64 --> 130.319
that impressive it's just warm it's just

128.459 --> 134.16
a bit of a warm August

130.319 --> 135.42
nothing over the top grass is all still

134.16 --> 137.459
very green

135.42 --> 139.14
right wine especially with all that most

137.459 --> 141.0
moist in the air it's it's going to stay

139.14 --> 144.66
green

141.0 --> 148.04
right so a nice fluffy looking clouds

144.66 --> 148.04
they're not rushing up there

149.099 --> 154.56
so there is a bit of wind here and there

151.8 --> 158.239
sometimes but it's not a lot not enough

154.56 --> 158.239
to make the doors Ram shut

158.28 --> 161.06
and all that

161.4 --> 168.84
so yeah it's kind of warm also I got a

165.54 --> 171.17999999999998
huge new plant well it's gonna be huge

168.84 --> 174.3
I got I finally got that mint plant I

171.18 --> 176.459
wanted organic

174.3 --> 178.37900000000002
like they normally don't even have them

176.459 --> 179.70000000000002
and suddenly they had them

178.379 --> 183.48
it's like

179.7 --> 185.33999999999997
it was just a wish on holding

183.48 --> 188.879
and now it arrives so they have mint

185.34 --> 191.519
plants I found that huge pot

188.879 --> 194.39999999999998
at the side of the road what is it a

191.519 --> 196.68
month ago it completely unscratched I

194.4 --> 198.9
was like whoa that's uh that's exactly

196.68 --> 202.739
what I was looking for

198.9 --> 204.59900000000002
and still had all that dirt so yeah I

202.739 --> 207.20000000000002
got a mint plant

204.599 --> 207.2
foreign

209.7 --> 213.85999999999999
this thing is going to explode

216.0 --> 222.78
because it has a huge amount of dirt and

220.319 --> 225.35999999999999
it's already like it looked like looking

222.78 --> 227.7
at the tops like this wasn't there

225.36 --> 230.87900000000002
yesterday so

227.7 --> 233.76
it's like immediately like yeah

230.879 --> 237.2
it's exploding already

233.76 --> 237.2
within like 12 hours

238.799 --> 244.22
so yeah I'll keep

240.599 --> 244.22
you up to date with that

252.659 --> 259.94
and then at some point I might have some

255.42 --> 259.94
fresh mint leaves for my tea

260.94 --> 266.36
right

262.44 --> 266.36
so let's see who's in chat

267.06 --> 274.82
hello Lynn Lenox first in chat

270.3 --> 274.82
good to see you LSG Thor KC

275.4 --> 278.69899999999996
it's pretty hot over there too

277.199 --> 280.62
all right

278.699 --> 283.34000000000003
all right now yeah I don't know about

280.62 --> 283.34000000000003
Fahrenheit

283.919 --> 290.58
I'm a Celsius guy

287.4 --> 292.82
because I use metric systems and all

290.58 --> 292.82
that

293.639 --> 299.1
uh

295.32 --> 301.32
37 whoa yeah that is that is hot

299.1 --> 304.139
yeah it doesn't get that hot over here

301.32 --> 305.759
you'd have to ask Tarot

304.139 --> 307.56
he gets those kinds of temperatures

305.759 --> 309.6
during summer

307.56 --> 312.66
and worse

309.6 --> 316.759
uh let's see what is it

312.66 --> 316.759
25 degrees oh okay

320.52 --> 325.82
25 degrees Celsius over here high

323.22 --> 329.94000000000005
humidity as I said

325.82 --> 331.38
56 so that is quite a lot and very

329.94 --> 335.28
little wind

331.38 --> 337.44
only 11 kilometers an hour average

335.28 --> 341.34
yep

337.44 --> 343.919
good thing that my senses just work

341.34 --> 346.58
I just like look it up to like see what

343.919 --> 346.58
they have to say

346.86 --> 351.32
of course I can just kind of size it up

351.9 --> 358.4
but the moist level is like a big factor

354.6 --> 358.40000000000003
moist and wind do like definitely

359.759 --> 364.88
very manipulate that perceived Heat

366.36 --> 372.68
anyway

368.639 --> 372.68
hey Richard G good to see you

378.479 --> 382.5
all right

380.16 --> 388.44
so

382.5 --> 388.44
it is Wednesday the 23rd of August 2023

391.5 --> 395.699
and yeah I feel pretty good I think I

393.9 --> 399.06
finally snapped

395.699 --> 400.74
the stay up late lock like I finally

399.06 --> 403.319
managed to like

400.74 --> 405.96000000000004
I just went to bed

403.319 --> 408.74
kind of early for my doing I'm very

405.96 --> 408.73999999999995
happy about that

428.639 --> 433.44
right also I did a little experiment

430.74 --> 437.46000000000004
yesterday with myself in the sense that

433.44 --> 440.16
I watched Star Wars the original one

437.46 --> 442.919
ahead was the modified version though so

440.16 --> 446.819
that did not help a lot I mean oh that's

442.919 --> 449.099
CGI add-on [ __ ] was was just stupid

446.819 --> 450.3
it it worsened it it worsened the

449.099 --> 451.74
quality

450.3 --> 454.139
it did

451.74 --> 457.56
wish I could get my hands on the old

454.139 --> 460.139
under this version the original one

457.56 --> 462.599
but yeah I had some stuff to think about

460.139 --> 463.86
of course the Mandela nonsense with the

462.599 --> 466.199
silver leg

463.86 --> 469.38
and I mean

466.199 --> 471.96000000000004
if you I tested it if you just don't

469.38 --> 474.12
know about it it's really easy to

471.96 --> 478.15999999999997
overlook if you're gripped onto the

474.12 --> 478.16
story I mean this is all psychology

478.319 --> 483.38
right

480.539 --> 483.38
also

485.88 --> 489.36
like

487.02 --> 491.28
putting down the nostalgic goggles for

489.36 --> 493.44
me because I basically watched it

491.28 --> 494.75899999999996
putting down the Nostalgia goggles for a

493.44 --> 496.86
moment

494.759 --> 499.259
because I do have some Nostalgia

496.86 --> 501.72
feelings but actually looking at it

499.259 --> 504.3
really dry it's like

501.72 --> 505.379
yeah looking at it as an uninterested

504.3 --> 508.16
person

505.379 --> 508.16
and

512.959 --> 518.5799999999999
like it one thing it does do is like it

516.779 --> 522.0
keeps your attention

518.58 --> 525.38
very it's a CR it's a well-crafted movie

522.0 --> 525.38
like it's very

526.26 --> 531.8389999999999
you know what type of movie

528.48 --> 535.26
it's and it's like the music is is

531.839 --> 537.72
really the thing about it like

535.26 --> 538.86
the standard of Star Wars music how they

537.72 --> 541.019
deal with it

538.86 --> 544.339
is really like

541.019 --> 548.519
they have a strong

544.339 --> 552.899
multi-tiered theme multiple themes

548.519 --> 555.66
and like and really like are directly

552.899 --> 558.54
attuned to whatever's happening at times

555.66 --> 560.279
like so both strong themes that give the

558.54 --> 562.68
background feeling and then it like the

560.279 --> 564.779
music reaches out and like touches the

562.68 --> 566.9399999999999
actual moment in the move they do that

564.779 --> 569.76
trickery which is like that is the best

566.94 --> 571.86
thing you can do with Movie music it's

569.76 --> 573.8389999999999
really set that standard that impressed

571.86 --> 576.38
the entire world so that's just that

573.839 --> 576.3800000000001
remains

576.66 --> 579.8
the acting

580.019 --> 586.279
is not as good as when you look at it

583.019 --> 586.279
when Nostalgia goggles

586.44 --> 589.5600000000001
but

587.88 --> 592.74
like it works

589.56 --> 594.779
it still works and like Luke isn't even

592.74 --> 597.9590000000001
that annoying I think it's just like

594.779 --> 600.62
he's playing a young guy

597.959 --> 600.6199999999999
and like

600.899 --> 606.959
how old is Luke supposed to be in that

603.779 --> 609.48
movie because if you'd say like okay

606.959 --> 612.779
he's supposed to represent like he's 14

609.48 --> 615.839
or 16. that would make sense with that

612.779 --> 617.82
type of behavior even though the guy was

615.839 --> 620.4200000000001
obviously older

617.82 --> 620.4200000000001
right

620.519 --> 623.18
so

624.899 --> 628.26
like

626.04 --> 630.5999999999999
I'm gonna do like a bit of a screwing

628.26 --> 634.16
with your head for a moment but imagine

630.6 --> 637.86
that instead of Luke it would have been

634.16 --> 640.8
Anakin the young Anakin from the Star

637.86 --> 643.26
Wars one right that you all love so much

640.8 --> 647.519
right well he because he's an annoying

643.26 --> 649.5
[ __ ] but imagine that it was that kid

647.519 --> 653.22
that was Luke

649.5 --> 655.68
at that age right young kid

653.22 --> 658.399
well Ben all those actions kind of make

655.68 --> 658.399
sense in a way

658.62 --> 664.44
right because it's like a young boy's

661.8 --> 665.8199999999999
actions or well not super young not

664.44 --> 670.7
preteen Young

665.82 --> 670.7
right but like a young teenager

671.1 --> 675.36
and that's like because that is what the

673.2 --> 679.6400000000001
story is about is that growth curve

675.36 --> 679.64
and very carefully written

682.14 --> 688.62
also Obi-Wan Kenobi is a very weird

685.8 --> 690.4799999999999
character now of course I have like all

688.62 --> 692.64
the knowledge now of like the so-called

690.48 --> 694.38
prequels and all that but there's a

692.64 --> 696.24
couple of things that are being said in

694.38 --> 698.7
Star Wars

696.24 --> 701.519
that are violated

698.7 --> 703.1400000000001
that have been violated

701.519 --> 706.32
through

703.14 --> 708.6
like the prequels because he says

706.32 --> 712.2
certain things like I don't ever

708.6 --> 716.76
remember owning a Droid with R2D2 what

712.2 --> 718.9200000000001
he blatantly in the movies has met R2D2

716.76 --> 720.959
and looks exactly the same like he would

718.92 --> 723.959
like record so

720.959 --> 727.3389999999999
right these are things that well that

723.959 --> 727.3389999999999
story simply didn't exist

728.94 --> 734.8800000000001
so there's like these details that were

731.64 --> 736.74
clearly written as a like Star Wars was

734.88 --> 739.32
written in a way like from a game master

736.74 --> 742.44
like the universe is already there

739.32 --> 745.74
but it's not written yet so it's like

742.44 --> 748.74
you'd say things that you could say it's

745.74 --> 752.1
all a what if what if type of rollout

748.74 --> 754.5
right because it's supposed to later fit

752.1 --> 756.899
when the things are worked out that's

754.5 --> 759.36
how I worked as a game master

756.899 --> 762.18
and I recognized that in it

759.36 --> 764.88
and and now I recognize even more how

762.18 --> 768.0
the prequels actually [ __ ] that up

764.88 --> 769.92
they didn't hold tight to every single

768.0 --> 772.079
word like every single word that came

769.92 --> 774.4799999999999
out of Obi-Wan Kenobi should have been

772.079 --> 776.8199999999999
like a Golden Rule and they should have

774.48 --> 779.4590000000001
written the moon prequels around that

776.82 --> 781.139
like they must they should have but they

779.459 --> 784.079
didn't

781.139 --> 786.0
I never even realized that

784.079 --> 787.7399999999999
never even thought of that

786.0 --> 789.66
it's just you take what he says for

787.74 --> 792.72
granted

789.66 --> 794.8199999999999
but he's like well because of the

792.72 --> 798.6
prequels they made him into a liar which

794.82 --> 801.74
is a very mean thing to do I think

798.6 --> 805.9200000000001
right anyways so it had me thinking

801.74 --> 808.8
Star Wars 4 A New Hope weird

805.92 --> 811.74
not as without the Nostalgia Googles

808.8 --> 815.2199999999999
it's not that good but it's still like

811.74 --> 817.32
it's a well-written movie as in keeps

815.22 --> 820.399
your attention it has interesting weird

817.32 --> 820.399
things all the time

822.0 --> 824.839
and

825.3 --> 829.56
I mean like the special effects are

828.18 --> 832.019
really aggressive

829.56 --> 835.0189999999999
but not just because of like the

832.019 --> 836.1
technicals of it but also it's just how

835.019 --> 839.4590000000001
it's

836.1 --> 841.98
how the camera time treats it it's it's

839.459 --> 844.8599999999999
a masterpiece in that sense like that

841.98 --> 848.279
there you could say the directing is

844.86 --> 850.139
then the editing is is really masterful

848.279 --> 853.76
so there's yeah there's definitely that

850.139 --> 853.76
but the other things is like

853.86 --> 857.88
yeah because you could say because of

856.2 --> 860.639
the Mandela effect

857.88 --> 863.22
you want to love it you want everything

860.639 --> 865.86
it's some things impressed you so much

863.22 --> 870.3000000000001
that you basically pull the rest up with

865.86 --> 872.04
it within your aesthetic mind

870.3 --> 873.959
and if you put the Nostalgia goggles

872.04 --> 877.74
down then you can certainly see where

873.959 --> 880.4399999999999
those other parameters really were

877.74 --> 882.54
and that's what I did it's been very

880.44 --> 884.94
interesting I mean it is a very

882.54 --> 886.86
interesting movie and the music is just

884.94 --> 890.0600000000001
so impressive

886.86 --> 890.0600000000001
it really is

890.339 --> 895.1
also Darth Vader is not that imposing

896.639 --> 899.72
it's kind of wooden

900.06 --> 905.8199999999999
which is really a giant contrast with

903.12 --> 908.16
the originals Darth Vader

905.82 --> 913.279
because literally

908.16 --> 913.279
is acting like he's got a broken back

913.38 --> 917.48
have you noticed how he moves

917.579 --> 921.3
in Star Wars it's like he has a broken

919.44 --> 923.399
but now he isn't hasn't really broken

921.3 --> 925.56
back he lifts a guy off the ground with

923.399 --> 927.72
his with one arm

925.56 --> 928.8
but the way he moves and like how he

927.72 --> 931.9200000000001
fights

928.8 --> 935.0999999999999
with Obi-Wan like he's really wooden

931.92 --> 938.519
that's not a flexible man at all

935.1 --> 941.639
it's not very impressive

938.519 --> 942.839
and even later too like from what I

941.639 --> 945.32
remember

942.839 --> 945.32
like

948.12 --> 953.699
as far as I I'm gonna I guess have to

950.76 --> 957.12
watch through it again but like

953.699 --> 959.459
Darth Vader doesn't make like jumps he

957.12 --> 961.86
doesn't do like jumps and all that stuff

959.459 --> 963.959
Luke does some jumps which are like whoa

961.86 --> 965.279
when you first saw that it's like whoa

963.959 --> 967.9799999999999
that's Magic

965.279 --> 969.72
right is awesome well how did he jump so

967.98 --> 973.1990000000001
high like what

969.72 --> 975.6600000000001
that was really from Star Wars five

973.199 --> 978.5
but Darth Vader doesn't do that like

975.66 --> 981.12
Darth Vader is just like more

978.5 --> 983.76
non-motion and super calculated and

981.12 --> 985.74
tactical in his maneuvering or that's

983.76 --> 988.62
how he's being represented there it's

985.74 --> 990.839
the style and that is such a massive

988.62 --> 993.3
contrast with

990.839 --> 996.1800000000001
the prequels

993.3 --> 997.92
how Anakin is up till the point that he

996.18 --> 999.5999999999999
does become Darth Vader

997.92 --> 1000.86
it's like

999.6 --> 1003.38
yeah

1000.86 --> 1005.54
it's just that I pick up it's just like

1003.38 --> 1007.639
it's not the same store it's not the

1005.54 --> 1010.639
same person in the suit not the same

1007.639 --> 1010.639
choreography

1016.779 --> 1021.639
hope you didn't get bored with all that

1031.76 --> 1035.079
local move virus

1037.329 --> 1042.6989999999998
[Music]

1039.86 --> 1042.6989999999998
okay

1046.339 --> 1050.98
I have no idea what that is Thor Casey

1051.44 --> 1057.46
if I watch Obi-Wan series no I heard

1054.14 --> 1057.46
terrible things about it

1070.94 --> 1076.0
s way to watch scenes with the music

1072.98 --> 1076.0
what do you mean

1083.36 --> 1088.28
oh Obi-Wan series did those okay fine

1086.419 --> 1092.0
dark AC

1088.28 --> 1094.28
sure maybe I mean despite everybody

1092.0 --> 1097.24
being super complaining I thought that

1094.28 --> 1097.24
Rogue one was great

1099.86 --> 1105.26
I think that Rogue one was like you yeah

1102.799 --> 1107.6
I mean everything has something but like

1105.26 --> 1109.52
Robo was like the only movie that didn't

1107.6 --> 1112.48
feel like it was just a gigantic

1109.52 --> 1112.48
betrayal of everything

1121.82 --> 1124.059
foreign

1131.86 --> 1138.26
also just like the thing I took notice

1135.14 --> 1141.14
of like in the in the story is like how

1138.26 --> 1143.419
they apply techno like I'm trying to

1141.14 --> 1146.3600000000001
back engineer like how they actually

1143.419 --> 1150.7990000000002
designed the story

1146.36 --> 1153.08
like the whole hologram from RTD R2D2

1150.799 --> 1154.94
like how they put that together like

1153.08 --> 1157.1599999999999
very careful

1154.94 --> 1159.919
and like that's the right like that's

1157.16 --> 1162.26
even like high I how I have applied to

1159.919 --> 1165.0800000000002
do like intro Mysteries

1162.26 --> 1169.1
of like magical things it's like you

1165.08 --> 1172.76
have like a a premonition but that's

1169.1 --> 1175.28
like or or like a vision or a site

1172.76 --> 1177.5
or yeah all kinds of things and then

1175.28 --> 1179.539
like work towards something that's gonna

1177.5 --> 1181.76
happen and then when it plays out that a

1179.539 --> 1183.08
person will ask like wait is that like

1181.76 --> 1184.28
from the dream

1183.08 --> 1185.48
yeah

1184.28 --> 1188.299
right

1185.48 --> 1191.9
that's sort of like yeah I mean that's

1188.299 --> 1193.76
just like compelling it it gives you the

1191.9 --> 1195.98
player a mission

1193.76 --> 1199.58
like to keep track of something to try

1195.98 --> 1203.0
to figure out a mystery right

1199.58 --> 1205.52
and in movie storytelling like that is

1203.0 --> 1209.0
also to a certain degree being applied

1205.52 --> 1211.4
with when it's actually written

1209.0 --> 1214.88
well like Star Wars

1211.4 --> 1218.179
like it keeps you busy with I like it

1214.88 --> 1223.24
will spark like ideas and like hey

1218.179 --> 1223.24
technology this technology not that

1223.7 --> 1229.22
and also like how the force is applied

1225.799 --> 1231.5
like yeah it it's great

1229.22 --> 1233.3600000000001
that it's a mystery like the force is

1231.5 --> 1236.12
really the best

1233.36 --> 1238.58
in Star Wars original hope because it's

1236.12 --> 1240.559
such a mystery

1238.58 --> 1242.6599999999999
there's so little

1240.559 --> 1244.6399999999999
and that's like the best because then

1242.66 --> 1246.799
that means it's like it could be

1244.64 --> 1250.8200000000002
everything

1246.799 --> 1252.679
and they sort of even do that

1250.82 --> 1254.8999999999999
with the scene with Darth Vader in this

1252.679 --> 1258.26
in the Death Star with that general or

1254.9 --> 1260.72
whatever it was Lieutenant something

1258.26 --> 1263.3799999999999
that says that this this starts the

1260.72 --> 1263.38
ultimate power

1266.24 --> 1274.0
of this battle station is significance

1269.539 --> 1274.0
compared to the power of the force

1275.12 --> 1277.6
right

1277.7 --> 1280.24
anyway

1284.24 --> 1289.039
right it is I like it is like those

1286.94 --> 1291.8200000000002
types of sentences where that voice like

1289.039 --> 1291.82
really works

1302.6 --> 1306.1589999999999
many bothans getting killed

1306.32 --> 1312.08
I don't even know what a boffin is still

1308.96 --> 1313.58
but I mean didn't they like blow up that

1312.08 --> 1317.9189999999999
Temple

1313.58 --> 1317.9189999999999
wasn't that City bothans or something

1320.059 --> 1325.3999999999999
or it wasn't basically the Rogue one

1322.34 --> 1328.24
crew the bothans

1325.4 --> 1328.24
I don't know

1333.14 --> 1338.1200000000001
um we're in Boston's like

1335.72 --> 1340.4
like part of that weren't that like the

1338.12 --> 1344.02
technical crew that actually built the

1340.4 --> 1344.02
Death Star that tried to leak it

1347.0 --> 1351.86
or if it were then it wouldn't have

1349.58 --> 1354.9189999999999
really worked

1351.86 --> 1357.08
yeah I get it

1354.919 --> 1359.7990000000002
anyway I still don't know what blossoms

1357.08 --> 1359.799
are so whatever

1361.76 --> 1367.82
it's like who are the bothans yeah it

1363.74 --> 1369.38
was that one guy he's the Boston's

1367.82 --> 1372.74
he died

1369.38 --> 1374.8600000000001

1372.74 --> 1374.86
lot

character I've ever seen

1771.32 --> 1777.5
I think he's worse

1773.84 --> 1779.72
actually worse than Jar Jar Binks

1777.5 --> 1781.76
I mean Jar Jar Binks is like annoying

1779.72 --> 1783.2
because he's kind of naturally attention

1781.76 --> 1786.26
grabby

1783.2 --> 1792.6200000000001

2128.079 --> 2134.26
you're an Unapologetic Stars no no it's

2131.079 --> 2137.5
rkc that's perfectly fine

2134.26 --> 2140.8590000000004
once had a parade with the fooled dude

2137.5 --> 2143.079
I hang around I'm a freaking

2140.859 --> 2145.5989999999997
Dungeons and Dragons game master I

2143.079 --> 2149.5
literally wrote a book so you don't have

2145.599 --> 2154.3590000000004
to apologize to me for being a nerd

2149.5 --> 2156.099
because I Am My Own Way am also a nerd

2154.359 --> 2158.44
probably worse

2156.099 --> 2161.6800000000003
nah not worse

2158.44 --> 2163.839
but yeah I just I'm not like a Comic-Con

2161.68 --> 2167.02
Star Wars kind of I was a fair a

2163.839 --> 2169.619
Renaissance Fair guy though

2167.02 --> 2169.619
it's different

2173.14 --> 2178.56
I I was a bit into LARPing

2175.72 --> 2178.56
but uh

2181.48 --> 2187.359
I knew a guy like the the my gaming

2184.72 --> 2188.7999999999997
group that I've been playing for what I

2187.359 --> 2191.0789999999997
had been playing for what is it five

2188.8 --> 2193.2400000000002
years or something with them until it

2191.079 --> 2196.6600000000003
broke up

2193.24 --> 2198.8199999999997
we originally met like in another group

2196.66 --> 2203.56
that was on what the hell was it in on

2198.82 --> 2206.98
meet up before it all got turned to [ __ ]

2203.56 --> 2209.0789999999997
and the guy there like

2206.98 --> 2212.14
that I was basically playing with

2209.079 --> 2215.1400000000003
actually did also have like a costume

2212.14 --> 2217.5989999999997
makeup of Darth Maul that was so good

2215.14 --> 2219.8799999999997
that he like

2217.599 --> 2222.6600000000003
like won a prize for that [ __ ]

2219.88 --> 2222.6600000000003
officially

2223.359 --> 2227.56
well yeah I saw followers that looked

2225.22 --> 2230.8799999999997
like exactly like the movie it just

2227.56 --> 2230.88
looked exactly like that

2232.54 --> 2237.339
like even the same body build and all

2235.78 --> 2240.0600000000004
that

2237.339 --> 2240.06
so

2241.66 --> 2246.52
do I still regularly play D no I haven't

2244.24 --> 2250.2599999999998
played in

2246.52 --> 2250.2599999999998
since the lockdown started

2252.28 --> 2256.3
and the group has like kind of

2254.14 --> 2258.64
officially scattered

2256.3 --> 2261.6400000000003
and I'm not happy about that

2258.64 --> 2265.56
because I had a lot of

2261.64 --> 2265.56
good times with them

2265.9 --> 2269.579
they were all like very different people

2272.619 --> 2276.7200000000003
but it was just it was great

2289.06 --> 2294.099
it was also great because I did actually

2291.7 --> 2296.0789999999997
get them to the point where they

2294.099 --> 2298.6600000000003
accepted

2296.079 --> 2300.82
that I was a flat earther

2298.66 --> 2304.0
and all that

2300.82 --> 2305.619
like they accepted it but kind of under

2304.0 --> 2308.079
the condition that I wouldn't whine

2305.619 --> 2310.6600000000003
about it but they did realize after a

2308.079 --> 2312.52
point that like yeah let's if we're

2310.66 --> 2314.3799999999997
gonna talk about spaceshit then he's

2312.52 --> 2316.48
gonna then that was kind of the rules

2314.38 --> 2318.099
it's like I'm not gonna bother them with

2316.48 --> 2319.599
letters because they didn't believe they

2318.099 --> 2322.54
can't have they were

2319.599 --> 2325.6600000000003
ball that [ __ ] but I mean that's not

2322.54 --> 2327.46
like oh the how dare you no I mean they

2325.66 --> 2329.6189999999997
were very liberal

2327.46 --> 2332.14
and they were good people all of them

2329.619 --> 2334.2400000000002
were like good guys they really were

2332.14 --> 2337.1189999999997
they they were like idealist good guys

2334.24 --> 2338.74
and they just can't handle evil and an

2337.119 --> 2340.54
illusion

2338.74 --> 2343.24
did their best and they did know there

2340.54 --> 2346.359
was trickery in society so they were

2343.24 --> 2347.7999999999997
better than average liberals I'd say

2346.359 --> 2349.66
they were part of my group but they

2347.8 --> 2353.32
accepted that I'd deal with flat Earth

2349.66 --> 2355.06
as long as I wouldn't like get like try

2353.32 --> 2356.98
to push it on them and I didn't I didn't

2355.06 --> 2358.54
want to I wanted them to get curious you

2356.98 --> 2361.48
see that's

2358.54 --> 2364.56
kind of subconsciously gave them

2361.48 --> 2364.56
like little things

2364.599 --> 2370.2400000000002
right but they knew that if some of

2368.8 --> 2372.04
these guys were kind of fanatical

2370.24 --> 2373.66
Glovers

2372.04 --> 2375.7599999999998
because they were just really big fans

2373.66 --> 2378.94
of it they just liked it they liked the

2375.76 --> 2379.9
idea of it all and like the discovery of

2378.94 --> 2382.66
it and

2379.9 --> 2384.82
right so he was trying to play that out

2382.66 --> 2386.74
but I would like counter that with like

2384.82 --> 2389.56
oh yeah well no did you know that the

2386.74 --> 2391.839
girth was a globe his character says

2389.56 --> 2393.099
and then elves that were there is like

2391.839 --> 2395.74
uh

2393.099 --> 2400.3
well it looked kind of it kind of looks

2395.74 --> 2402.64
flat I don't know right this is

2400.3 --> 2405.3390000000004
it's like yeah I am still the game

2402.64 --> 2408.0989999999997
master okay like just because I'm not

2405.339 --> 2409.599
confronting you with my insights about

2408.099 --> 2412.3590000000004
the Flat Earth

2409.599 --> 2415.06
doesn't mean that I'm gonna just let you

2412.359 --> 2418.06
roll out your Globe dreams

2415.06 --> 2420.04
without any confrontation to reasonable

2418.06 --> 2421.2999999999997
levels and that's kind of how we dealt

2420.04 --> 2423.82
with it

2421.3 --> 2426.099
it was all very stimulating

2423.82 --> 2427.6600000000003
right but they accepted that I was a

2426.099 --> 2431.079
flat earther as long as I didn't get

2427.66 --> 2432.5789999999997
pushy on them like as as like religious

2431.079 --> 2435.3390000000004
people do right

2432.579 --> 2439.079
and they wouldn't do it back like they

2435.339 --> 2439.0789999999997
were reasonable and I like that

2439.42 --> 2444.88
and they were acceptant of my

2441.579 --> 2446.98
sensitivity and of my like just my way

2444.88 --> 2449.619
of being and

2446.98 --> 2453.64
and hey I used I could play Dark

2449.619 --> 2456.94
characters and be extremely impressive

2453.64 --> 2459.42
and all that so I can be a very good

2456.94 --> 2459.42
game master

2461.079 --> 2466.5
and they paid me in beer and cookies I'm

2463.9 --> 2466.5
not joking

2466.599 --> 2469.6800000000003
now is the deal

2474.4 --> 2481.7200000000003
chocolate cookies and beer

2478.24 --> 2483.64
if I got that well not the beer but the

2481.72 --> 2485.98
guy would always also give chocolate

2483.64 --> 2488.7999999999997
cookies organic ones even so it was just

2485.98 --> 2490.54
nice like they were carrying they did

2488.8 --> 2492.52
know I eat eight organic and they

2490.54 --> 2496.119
respected it and all that they didn't

2492.52 --> 2498.16
but I mean yeah it's their life

2496.119 --> 2500.1400000000003
also I'm proud that one of the last

2498.16 --> 2502.66
things that I did do

2500.14 --> 2505.48
before yeah the last things that I did

2502.66 --> 2509.2
do when we're still met together was

2505.48 --> 2511.839
like really worn the girl in the group

2509.2 --> 2514.72
will also have to be the girlfriend of

2511.839 --> 2518.94
one of the players really told that Doom

2514.72 --> 2518.9399999999996
don't do it don't take that shot

2519.579 --> 2525.2200000000003
don't do it it's not worth it

2522.46 --> 2527.38
like you have energy you have compassion

2525.22 --> 2531.4599999999996
you you want to help the world don't do

2527.38 --> 2534.2200000000003
it it's gonna take that away from you

2531.46 --> 2535.119
please like I really begged her to her

2534.22 --> 2537.7
face

2535.119 --> 2539.92
when we had frictions although I really

2537.7 --> 2541.359
meant it like I really hope that she's

2539.92 --> 2544.119
okay because

2541.359 --> 2545.74
yes just just like a real a British

2544.119 --> 2550.2000000000003
woman okay

2545.74 --> 2550.2
a British liberal kind of woman

2550.48 --> 2555.88
so it would not be in

2553.42 --> 2557.14
an overstatement to say that she's kind

2555.88 --> 2560.98
of a Karen

2557.14 --> 2564.46
but she's also really nice and she's

2560.98 --> 2565.54
like she wasn't or she is I hope still a

2564.46 --> 2568.54
masseuse

2565.54 --> 2569.859
really cared for people and People's

2568.54 --> 2572.859
Health

2569.859 --> 2575.74
but unfortunately God easily carried

2572.859 --> 2577.839
away with news items and then the newest

2575.74 --> 2579.7
thing and that was like really her

2577.839 --> 2581.92
problem and I really tried to warn her

2579.7 --> 2583.66
like please don't take it please I

2581.92 --> 2587.079
really like look almost with tears about

2583.66 --> 2589.3799999999997
it please I beg of you don't do it beg

2587.079 --> 2589.38
of you

2590.02 --> 2593.52
I really hope she didn't

2593.92 --> 2599.319
right I haven't heard of them

2597.04 --> 2602.8
since

2599.319 --> 2605.68
have not contacted me

2602.8 --> 2608.619
I did try to hit some of them up like

2605.68 --> 2610.839
hey but they haven't really gotten her I

2608.619 --> 2613.839
hope they're all right

2610.839 --> 2616.06
I fear the worst though but I mean I

2613.839 --> 2617.14
might be overplaying it

2616.06 --> 2619.2999999999997
it

2617.14 --> 2621.64
I don't even know what like the average

2619.3 --> 2624.1600000000003
percentage of

2621.64 --> 2626.14
severe damage was in the Netherlands

2624.16 --> 2628.06
because it's different in different

2626.14 --> 2630.5789999999997
regions you see

2628.06 --> 2632.68
it's very different in my country than

2630.579 --> 2635.92
in another country

2632.68 --> 2638.14
or or even like specific regions within

2635.92 --> 2642.2400000000002
my country versus other regions in my

2638.14 --> 2642.24
country so I don't know exactly like

2643.0 --> 2650.02
how to how to see that

2646.66 --> 2652.1189999999997
what I am noticing is that to it doesn't

2650.02 --> 2654.339
just seem like

2652.119 --> 2656.619
half the people died or so it's not like

2654.339 --> 2659.56
I see less people everywhere so it can't

2656.619 --> 2661.78
be all that bad

2659.56 --> 2664.72
there's still plenty of people around it

2661.78 --> 2666.94
it seems just as much as normal and like

2664.72 --> 2670.0
on days where there's a market on the

2666.94 --> 2674.88
street it is still very crowded it looks

2670.0 --> 2674.88
just as crowded as say 10 years ago

2675.7 --> 2681.339
right it looks just as crowded so it's

2678.579 --> 2682.599
not like half of all people died or

2681.339 --> 2684.42
something

2682.599 --> 2687.04
right

2684.42 --> 2689.44
it's not that bad thank God and it's

2687.04 --> 2693.16
still like I just really hope that if

2689.44 --> 2696.0
this [ __ ] hits off again in September

2693.16 --> 2698.7999999999997
because it seems like it's going to guys

2696.0 --> 2700.24
heads up again if I if you hadn't caught

2698.8 --> 2702.94
that yet

2700.24 --> 2704.6189999999997
halfway September there is a big chance

2702.94 --> 2708.46
that there's going to be an attempt at

2704.619 --> 2711.88
another worldwide lockdown

2708.46 --> 2715.42
because of a new covet I mean it's kind

2711.88 --> 2718.839
of been announced and [ __ ] it's

2715.42 --> 2720.64
and and through through peop people have

2718.839 --> 2722.819
been leaking it like that's that's the

2720.64 --> 2722.819
day

2725.5 --> 2731.38
right so I really hope that this time

2728.859 --> 2735.5789999999997
the amount of like rules that people

2731.38 --> 2737.619
abided by like it got pretty bad

2735.579 --> 2740.319
in the Netherlands but then there was a

2737.619 --> 2742.42
lot of pushback but I mean especially

2740.319 --> 2745.18
businesses like restaurants had a

2742.42 --> 2747.099
pounding they had like really bad like a

2745.18 --> 2751.6189999999997
lot of businesses went out of business

2747.099 --> 2751.619
basically restaurants and stuff

2754.3 --> 2758.46
I hope it's going to be different this

2756.28 --> 2758.46
time

2759.22 --> 2764.0789999999997
I mean all the things that came out of

2761.92 --> 2766.2400000000002
what happened then stand it's like

2764.079 --> 2768.819
there's like things have happened it

2766.24 --> 2772.359
like things have been done by the just

2768.819 --> 2774.94
by the justice system and all that so

2772.359 --> 2777.46
they can't just pretend that like that

2774.94 --> 2779.44
all didn't happen right

2777.46 --> 2781.0
the grounds are different if something

2779.44 --> 2784.18
like this is going to roll out and I

2781.0 --> 2786.88
really hope that this time the people

2784.18 --> 2788.44
whether they have a brain or they don't

2786.88 --> 2790.119
that they're all just even

2788.44 --> 2792.52
subconsciously are going to be knit

2790.119 --> 2794.6800000000003
together and like [ __ ] off with this

2792.52 --> 2797.68
delusion we're not fall it doesn't

2794.68 --> 2801.16
matter whether a virus is real or not

2797.68 --> 2803.98
whether viruses exist or not

2801.16 --> 2806.319
what these measures are it's all mind

2803.98 --> 2809.02
control and there is nothing that it can

2806.319 --> 2811.54
even do that could be considered a

2809.02 --> 2812.38
positive influence on anybody's immune

2811.54 --> 2814.96
system

2812.38 --> 2816.819
right and I hope that that is going to

2814.96 --> 2819.52
keep it all knit together all the people

2816.819 --> 2822.4
are just going to be like no no we're

2819.52 --> 2825.4
not gonna do you may take some of us

2822.4 --> 2829.6600000000003
you may take some business of us you may

2825.4 --> 2832.1800000000003
fire some people but we're not going to

2829.66 --> 2835.56
comply

2832.18 --> 2838.54
and I hope there will be peer pressure

2835.56 --> 2841.06
towards others not people you don't know

2838.54 --> 2843.52
but the people that you do know that

2841.06 --> 2847.359
there will be peer pressure towards them

2843.52 --> 2850.78
to say don't do that

2847.359 --> 2852.2799999999997
by you complying you're siding With the

2850.78 --> 2854.8590000000004
Enemy and you don't have to say that

2852.28 --> 2858.4
dramatically but that is what it is like

2854.859 --> 2861.88
you complying gives them literal power

2858.4 --> 2864.94
and the more people that do that will

2861.88 --> 2867.6400000000003
like guarantee it's going to happen

2864.94 --> 2871.06
again like it's not going to stop until

2867.64 --> 2874.0
there is zero people complying

2871.06 --> 2875.98
it's only gonna go away if nobody

2874.0 --> 2879.339
complies

2875.98 --> 2881.319
so use peer pressure not against the the

2879.339 --> 2883.599
the the scummy

2881.319 --> 2885.339
Bill Gates's and all those people right

2883.599 --> 2887.92
that are gonna do what they do I mean

2885.339 --> 2891.339
they're very open about it really

2887.92 --> 2893.5
but the people that might comply you

2891.339 --> 2896.7999999999997
know them they're in your building if

2893.5 --> 2900.119
they're in your family this time

2896.8 --> 2900.119
you push back

2900.46 --> 2906.46
make them conscious make them conscious

2903.819 --> 2909.2799999999997
about the the influence that their

2906.46 --> 2911.579
action their response have on their

2909.28 --> 2911.579
Nation

2911.68 --> 2916.18
and that's why I said yesterday when I

2913.78 --> 2918.579
first mentioned this like if you comply

2916.18 --> 2921.7599999999998
with these measures

2918.579 --> 2925.1800000000003
you're a traitor to your country

2921.76 --> 2928.0600000000004
now maybe not by legal standards but by

2925.18 --> 2930.7
spirits that by God's legal standards

2928.06 --> 2932.88
the stair standards of the spirit you

2930.7 --> 2932.8799999999997
are

2933.339 --> 2939.88
so be aware of that and do not comply

2936.72 --> 2943.66
with their tricks

2939.88 --> 2946.3
do not don't you dare be weak and give

2943.66 --> 2949.54
them more power do you hear

2946.3 --> 2952.96
don't let don't let them do it

2949.54 --> 2954.579
you got to be tight they gotta hold

2952.96 --> 2956.14
do

2954.579 --> 2959.5
if it's within your range of

2956.14 --> 2962.7999999999997
possibilities like try to bribe them to

2959.5 --> 2964.599
not comply okay serious if it's I mean

2962.8 --> 2967.42
if there's oath they only care about

2964.599 --> 2969.46
money and all that yeah well then

2967.42 --> 2971.6800000000003
they'll just do it anyway and all that

2969.46 --> 2973.859
there's gonna be profit to be found in

2971.68 --> 2973.859
it

2974.2 --> 2981.24
and like being part of advertising all

2976.599 --> 2981.2400000000002
that crap and oh do this wear that right

2982.9 --> 2989.319
but they are traitors

2986.56 --> 2991.599
that's literally selling out against

2989.319 --> 2993.64
your nation it's making it's gonna make

2991.599 --> 2996.52
things worse if you comply or if you

2993.64 --> 2999.2999999999997
like partake in business that comes out

2996.52 --> 2999.3
of it directly

3001.079 --> 3005.76
become aware of this excerpt peer

3004.38 --> 3007.6800000000003
pressure

3005.76 --> 3010.5600000000004
this is one of the things that you

3007.68 --> 3013.14
should do it over because it's more than

3010.56 --> 3014.339
that it's not just about People's Health

3013.14 --> 3016.68
anymore

3014.339 --> 3020.04
about their health by compliance no no

3016.68 --> 3022.6189999999997
it's not just by you doing that

3020.04 --> 3026.18
you make it worse for even for the

3022.619 --> 3026.1800000000003
people that don't comply you see

3026.819 --> 3034.88
you must also unify

3031.02 --> 3034.88
or you're a traitor to the nation

3038.88 --> 3044.9
so that's my message

3041.94 --> 3044.9
be warned

3051.079 --> 3055.3390000000004
come by with the interrupt yeah

3056.339 --> 3061.0789999999997
yeah if that sure if they're gonna like

3058.68 --> 3064.7999999999997
shut [ __ ] down then

3061.079 --> 3067.559
but I mean don't just don't comply and

3064.8 --> 3071.46
be prepared

3067.559 --> 3072.7200000000003
get your own power grid

3071.46 --> 3076.2
all right

3072.72 --> 3078.2999999999997
get your own power grid get your own

3076.2 --> 3082.04
well

3078.3 --> 3082.04
get your own biodiesel

3082.44 --> 3085.619
and protect it

3084.29 --> 3087.96
[Music]

3085.619 --> 3090.119
if they're just gonna like blow up their

3087.96 --> 3092.579
own own stations just to starve people

3090.119 --> 3095.28
out to create a Siege

3092.579 --> 3098.76
artificial Siege

3095.28 --> 3101.94
through through depletion of Commerce

3098.76 --> 3104.0400000000004
then you must have those things like

3101.94 --> 3106.859
with your group it's like oh they're

3104.04 --> 3110.7
shutting [ __ ] down well then you gotta

3106.859 --> 3115.44
with your community replace it

3110.7 --> 3120.3799999999997
so get your bio diesel reactor like make

3115.44 --> 3120.38
your own get your own power generators

3120.42 --> 3126.48
get like good Wells and like protect

3124.319 --> 3130.14
them don't just build it

3126.48 --> 3132.18
make sure it's protected it's secure

3130.14 --> 3134.5789999999997
nobody's just gonna walk up there and

3132.18 --> 3136.22
poison it or sabotage it

3134.579 --> 3140.119
yeah

3136.22 --> 3140.1189999999997
protect it actively

3140.76 --> 3146.28
because there will be agents going out

3143.88 --> 3148.2000000000003
like they have sabotaging [ __ ] because

3146.28 --> 3150.7200000000003
that's the plan now the dark ones are

3148.2 --> 3153.0589999999997
going down they're going out and just

3150.72 --> 3155.72
blowing things up food sources power

3153.059 --> 3155.7200000000003
sources

3159.66 --> 3164.7599999999998
and well the BlackRock type companies

3162.96 --> 3167.099
BlackRock Vanguard they just give them

3164.76 --> 3169.1400000000003
open Notes just oh yeah finally there

3167.099 --> 3170.6400000000003
you are okay here's where this is the

3169.14 --> 3173.339
part where you got to blow them then the

3170.64 --> 3176.52
whole thing goes in Goes Up in Flames

3173.339 --> 3179.2799999999997
they're just that one because BlackRock

3176.52 --> 3182.64
Vanguard doesn't give a [ __ ]

3179.28 --> 3184.92
it's all just Monopoly to them it's it's

3182.64 --> 3186.96
just a piece of plastic on a board to

3184.92 --> 3188.64
them they don't care if that stuff blows

3186.96 --> 3190.859
up they don't care if thousands of

3188.64 --> 3192.54
people starve because of that they don't

3190.859 --> 3193.859
care it's all just a bunch of power

3192.54 --> 3196.2
games

3193.859 --> 3198.18
so they'll just like oh terrorists oh

3196.2 --> 3199.6189999999997
finally this exactly what I need now

3198.18 --> 3203.7599999999998
burn this down

3199.619 --> 3206.819
and then I'll proceed like be climbing

3203.76 --> 3210.42
further towards our plan

3206.819 --> 3212.64
yeah starve everybody out evaluate and

3210.42 --> 3216.059
then buy it all up like they'll be

3212.64 --> 3218.4
begging they'll literally give it to you

3216.059 --> 3222.8
just if you give them an apple

3218.4 --> 3222.8
right like complete Psychopaths

3224.7 --> 3228.839
so get your own resources and protect

3227.76 --> 3230.8190000000004
them

3228.839 --> 3232.5589999999997
because there is going to be industrial

3230.819 --> 3235.5
espionage

3232.559 --> 3238.44
and sabotage mostly

3235.5 --> 3241.74
the real Hazard now is covert industrial

3238.44 --> 3243.96
sabotage it's happening everywhere like

3241.74 --> 3246.7799999999997
they're trying this [ __ ] everywhere

3243.96 --> 3248.04
and if like BlackRock fan guard is in

3246.78 --> 3250.619
control

3248.04 --> 3253.38
they just open the doors to the

3250.619 --> 3257.099
saboteurs and the terrorists

3253.38 --> 3259.26
that's reality now people so know where

3257.099 --> 3262.38
they are

3259.26 --> 3264.96
no what is Blackrock Vanguard and what

3262.38 --> 3267.599
is it and be very careful

3264.96 --> 3270.7200000000003
be very careful on

3267.599 --> 3273.02
allowing yourself to rely on systems

3270.72 --> 3276.839
that are

3273.02 --> 3279.599
directly under control of those Mega

3276.839 --> 3283.52
corporate those fronts

3279.599 --> 3283.52
those financial Mega fronts

3283.98 --> 3289.14
corporate fronts right

3286.92 --> 3292.2000000000003
very careful

3289.14 --> 3294.7799999999997
you want the the trail of your product

3292.2 --> 3297.4199999999996
to basically end with

3294.78 --> 3298.559
with individuals with farmers

3297.42 --> 3302.28
with

3298.559 --> 3306.8590000000004
metal workers Engineers that's where you

3302.28 --> 3306.8590000000004
want your Trail to end and not

3306.96 --> 3312.54
in the checkbook of a bunch of Grapplers

3309.119 --> 3314.04
that that's basically what it is

3312.54 --> 3316.02
because if it's gonna end in that

3314.04 --> 3318.24
checkbook of the grappler they will

3316.02 --> 3320.16
literally like have you snuffed out just

3318.24 --> 3323.5989999999997
like that and they won't even notice it

3320.16 --> 3323.5989999999997
it happens to them

3325.44 --> 3327.92
anyway

3328.68 --> 3334.44
so get your own power generator get your

3331.8 --> 3337.319
make your own biodiesel

3334.44 --> 3340.64
and dig your own Wells

3337.319 --> 3340.64
and secure them

3340.92 --> 3343.4
right

3343.8 --> 3348.54
if you got that

3346.26 --> 3351.6600000000003
you you'll make it

3348.54 --> 3355.5589999999997
but make sure it's secured I mean the

3351.66 --> 3359.22
Sabbath like the more it's realized how

3355.559 --> 3361.8590000000004
such a place made by people that aren't

3359.22 --> 3364.2
like part of government just doing that

3361.859 --> 3366.18
the more it becomes apparent to the

3364.2 --> 3369.5989999999997
outside world that that is what's

3366.18 --> 3372.54
keeping everybody strong and healthy

3369.599 --> 3374.579
and uncomplying the more they're gonna

3372.54 --> 3378.48
try to send saboteurs and eventually

3374.579 --> 3381.599
like SWAT teams and maybe even like

3378.48 --> 3384.9
freaking license to Kill spies and [ __ ]

3381.599 --> 3387.54
so you've got to be the the stronger you

3384.9 --> 3389.46
are the the higher the challenges will

3387.54 --> 3391.099
be that you're gonna face so be aware of

3389.46 --> 3395.099
all that

3391.099 --> 3398.0
I mean it's not gonna be a bad thing to

3395.099 --> 3398.0
have like a

3398.04 --> 3403.74
a fortification expert

3401.099 --> 3406.559
be part of your crew if you're gonna

3403.74 --> 3410.64
build a site where you're where you're

3406.559 --> 3413.0400000000004
gonna generate your own biodiesel

3410.64 --> 3416.7
power electricity

3413.04 --> 3418.74
and water supply right it's not bad to

3416.7 --> 3420.2999999999997
have one of those people be part of your

3418.74 --> 3423.3799999999997
team because

3420.3 --> 3426.98
you're probably gonna have to defend it

3423.38 --> 3426.98
from serious

3427.76 --> 3433.079
Espionage or even military assault or

3431.7 --> 3435.859
something

3433.079 --> 3435.8590000000004
at some point

3435.9 --> 3441.079
right

3437.76 --> 3441.079
that's my recommendation

3445.98 --> 3449.76
right

3447.359 --> 3452.7599999999998
Siege was always the method that we're

3449.76 --> 3454.6800000000003
gonna use I I announced this I said that

3452.76 --> 3458.1600000000003
we're gonna do it it's Neo feudalism

3454.68 --> 3460.6189999999997
well neophyalism is just feudalism what

3458.16 --> 3463.0789999999997
did they do with feudalism

3460.619 --> 3465.3
how did most people die starvation how

3463.079 --> 3470.7000000000003
did that happen Siege

3465.3 --> 3470.7000000000003
what is Siege cutting off Logistics

3471.3 --> 3476.04
cutting off food supply

3474.18 --> 3477.66
well what's happening right now it's

3476.04 --> 3479.099
that's exactly what's happening right

3477.66 --> 3481.3799999999997
now and now

3479.099 --> 3484.44
they don't do it with armies that

3481.38 --> 3488.7000000000003
surround castle walls

3484.44 --> 3492.42
they do it with the a digital

3488.7 --> 3495.4399999999996
yeah with digital economy

3492.42 --> 3495.44
and the

3495.78 --> 3501.0
control ability to just turn it off with

3498.42 --> 3504.7200000000003
without any kind of

3501.0 --> 3504.72
like responsibility

3505.44 --> 3510.8
there doesn't seem to be any real legal

3508.079 --> 3510.8
responsibility

3510.839 --> 3516.319
for these Mega corporations just owning

3514.5 --> 3518.52
critical

3516.319 --> 3520.5589999999997
infrastructure and all that on which

3518.52 --> 3522.119
people's lives Depend and they don't

3520.559 --> 3524.46
seem to

3522.119 --> 3528.599
they're not being held to account

3524.46 --> 3532.28
for that responsibility when they fail

3528.599 --> 3532.28
this is a terrible situation

3533.22 --> 3538.98
right so they are like

3535.98 --> 3540.9
nobility that are just going around and

3538.98 --> 3543.299
start giving out orders and then the

3540.9 --> 3546.1800000000003
peons have to follow or they get starved

3543.299 --> 3549.2599999999998
or they get punished some other way

3546.18 --> 3552.0589999999997
and then just see just start happening

3549.26 --> 3554.579
War start happening and

3552.059 --> 3556.92
that the mega corporations they're the

3554.579 --> 3558.2400000000002
new nobility right they are the Neo

3556.92 --> 3560.299
feudalists

3558.24 --> 3562.74
of this

3560.299 --> 3565.74
neo-fuelism that's kind of technocratic

3562.74 --> 3568.68
because the power and the control comes

3565.74 --> 3570.3799999999997
with that control of

3568.68 --> 3574.819
the economy

3570.38 --> 3574.819
of the digital world

3574.859 --> 3579.0589999999997
that's now where the power is and that's

3577.02 --> 3581.099
where they can turn it off or turn it on

3579.059 --> 3583.079
that's how they have power through the

3581.099 --> 3586.98
technocracy so it's like a technocratic

3583.079 --> 3586.98
Neo feudalism basically

3587.579 --> 3591.8390000000004
and the politicians are there to kind of

3590.16 --> 3594.18
Stave off

3591.839 --> 3596.46
the power of the people that they have

3594.18 --> 3599.16
and like allow them to be indoctrinated

3596.46 --> 3601.52
to self-enslave so that it can so that

3599.16 --> 3604.2599999999998
the technocrats can just continue

3601.52 --> 3605.819
abusing their power without any serious

3604.26 --> 3609.0
pushback

3605.819 --> 3611.22
which is legally Justified

3609.0 --> 3612.839
what politicians are there to kind of

3611.22 --> 3615.299
like prevent the people from getting

3612.839 --> 3617.66
enough momentum to actually apply their

3615.299 --> 3617.66
rights

3617.72 --> 3623.66
they're just not getting to it because

3619.92 --> 3623.66
the politicians are holding them off

3625.319 --> 3629.94
you know this is true

3627.54 --> 3631.74
right

3629.94 --> 3633.66
it's not yeah that yeah it's really

3631.74 --> 3638.359
non-communicate well that is digital

3633.66 --> 3638.359
right digital Finance communication

3639.299 --> 3643.559
great

3640.559 --> 3643.559
technocracy

3649.859 --> 3653.46
but

3651.119 --> 3655.2000000000003
but I mean they're not even that much

3653.46 --> 3657.0
shutting down communication it's more

3655.2 --> 3659.0989999999997
like Public Communication right

3657.0 --> 3661.44
Broadcasting

3659.099 --> 3663.9
which is not the same as like oh I'm now

3661.44 --> 3665.04
not able to just call somebody up on the

3663.9 --> 3667.26
phone

3665.04 --> 3668.88
that's not what they're shutting down

3667.26 --> 3671.099
um they might like in China or something

3668.88 --> 3673.079
I'm not sure

3671.099 --> 3675.059
how far they take that

3673.079 --> 3676.6800000000003
but that's not what they shut down they

3675.059 --> 3679.1600000000003
don't shut down like private

3676.68 --> 3682.3799999999997
communication they shut down Public

3679.16 --> 3684.72
Communication Broadcasting

3682.38 --> 3687.599
where you're just sending it out for

3684.72 --> 3690.839
everybody to witness

3687.599 --> 3693.2400000000002
or look up later like but that's a it's

3690.839 --> 3694.819
a different thing though

3693.24 --> 3698.339
right

3694.819 --> 3701.7799999999997
broadcasting is kind of different from

3698.339 --> 3701.7799999999997
just private Communications

3702.119 --> 3706.339
because broadcasting is public

3706.859 --> 3712.619
I don't think people realize that like

3709.559 --> 3715.799
it isn't technically the same

3712.619 --> 3718.6400000000003
and I think that there's a bit of a

3715.799 --> 3721.5
like it's still legally kind of messy

3718.64 --> 3723.839
and also in public Consciousness that

3721.5 --> 3726.68
they're not people aren't aware that

3723.839 --> 3729.599
it's like distinctly different you see

3726.68 --> 3733.7
broadcasting and private communication

3729.599 --> 3733.7000000000003
are legally very different

3736.079 --> 3740.3590000000004
I don't think people are really aware of

3738.18 --> 3740.359
that

3741.599 --> 3746.2200000000003
like privacy laws apply to private

3744.839 --> 3749.16
communication

3746.22 --> 3752.7799999999997
they don't apply to Broadcasting

3749.16 --> 3752.7799999999997
because you're Broadcasting

3753.599 --> 3758.299
but that makes it all very different

3758.94 --> 3764.819
other legal applications to both

3762.72 --> 3767.4199999999996
situations

3764.819 --> 3767.42
anyway

3788.04 --> 3791.0589999999997
final state

3792.599 --> 3798.0
perhaps yeah I mean usually the moments

3795.9 --> 3800.819
where real communication is completely

3798.0 --> 3802.799
turned off and nobody knows why that's

3800.819 --> 3804.72
usually the moments that the Assassins

3802.799 --> 3807.059
are being sent out and then it's like oh

3804.72 --> 3808.5
the power goes off back on it all turns

3807.059 --> 3811.3390000000004
out a whole bunch of people were killed

3808.5 --> 3811.339
surprise surprise

3812.16 --> 3816.18
and then everybody really does their

3814.44 --> 3818.46
best to just forget that it'll happen

3816.18 --> 3820.7
because it's so horrific that that just

3818.46 --> 3820.7
happens

3821.04 --> 3826.079
and it happens more often than people

3823.14 --> 3828.42
would like to admit that it happens

3826.079 --> 3831.6600000000003
and it's never officially recognized in

3828.42 --> 3833.2200000000003
the news either that it happens and when

3831.66 --> 3835.6189999999997
people talk about it on their own

3833.22 --> 3838.2599999999998
private platforms on YouTube

3835.619 --> 3840.359
it's they will just be called conspiracy

3838.26 --> 3842.1600000000003
theorists not because it isn't true but

3840.359 --> 3843.9
because people literally just don't want

3842.16 --> 3845.22
to know that that happens they don't

3843.9 --> 3848.1800000000003
want to hear about it because it's

3845.22 --> 3848.18
[ __ ] terrifying

3849.119 --> 3857.7000000000003
and it makes it very hard to just live

3853.98 --> 3861.0
knowing that that [ __ ] happens

3857.7 --> 3862.859
so yeah power goes off

3861.0 --> 3864.26
dude

3862.859 --> 3868.4
arm yourself

3864.26 --> 3868.4
and be ready

3868.799 --> 3873.299
you might be on their list

3871.619 --> 3875.339
you might be

3873.299 --> 3876.72
it all depends on how big a scale

3875.339 --> 3879.18
they're gonna

3876.72 --> 3881.64
take action

3879.18 --> 3883.859
what their priorities are I mean if

3881.64 --> 3886.3799999999997
you're literally a nobody nobody you're

3883.859 --> 3890.339
not like nobody's publicly aware of you

3886.38 --> 3894.44
or and you don't hold any key position

3890.339 --> 3894.44
where you're defending like a community

3894.72 --> 3898.5
then you probably don't have a lot of

3896.76 --> 3900.6600000000003
things to worry about other than your

3898.5 --> 3903.2
key players from your community getting

3900.66 --> 3903.2
targeted

3910.559 --> 3916.799
right so just because you know you're

3913.02 --> 3919.44
safe don't just stand back

3916.799 --> 3922.4
realize who would be targeted and then

3919.44 --> 3922.4
help defend them

3937.16 --> 3940.5
okay that's weird

3938.89 --> 3942.299
[Music]

3940.5 --> 3944.099
and yes

3942.299 --> 3947.059
of course the buildings would fall

3944.099 --> 3947.059
anyway this is

3947.4 --> 3952.559
the only difference is is that

3949.68 --> 3954.5989999999997
whoever had that giant insurance policy

3952.559 --> 3957.059
on the building wouldn't actually get

3954.599 --> 3960.599
what was it

3957.059 --> 3961.92
10 billion dollars insurance money

3960.599 --> 3966.48
because it

3961.92 --> 3968.04
the the towers were specifically insured

3966.48 --> 3970.64
against

3968.04 --> 3970.64
like

3971.16 --> 3975.54
basically getting completely destroyed

3973.619 --> 3977.4
because of a plane hitting it I'm not

3975.54 --> 3979.799
even kidding like that's like

3977.4 --> 3982.859
almost verbatim

3979.799 --> 3984.5389999999998
like in the insurance contract

3982.859 --> 3988.38
that they had

3984.539 --> 3991.079
like it was like a joke like right

3988.38 --> 3994.02
yeah well that's fine like yeah you can

3991.079 --> 3996.0
ensure it against that because that's a

3994.02 --> 3997.799
for those not in the know it's always

3996.0 --> 4001.4
going to be a win right because yeah

3997.799 --> 4004.819
it's literally physically impossible

4001.4 --> 4005.78
to make a Tower collapse with any kind

4004.819 --> 4010.0389999999998
of Fire

4005.78 --> 4014.3190000000004
without any structural explosives or

4010.039 --> 4014.3190000000004
something like that being involved

4014.599 --> 4018.7400000000002
right so yeah of course we're going to

4016.7 --> 4021.6189999999997
ensure that if that's what you want like

4018.74 --> 4023.66
because that's yeah that's

4021.619 --> 4024.92
10 billion or whatever it is yeah of

4023.66 --> 4027.0789999999997
course because

4024.92 --> 4028.7000000000003
that can never happen I mean it's plenty

4027.079 --> 4030.319
of planes that crashed in the buildings

4028.7 --> 4032.8999999999996
and even buildings that burn out

4030.319 --> 4035.42
completely into like a steel skeleton

4032.9 --> 4037.579
nothing else with left and they still

4035.42 --> 4039.98
wouldn't crash

4037.579 --> 4042.319
because steel frame buildings don't do

4039.98 --> 4045.76
that they don't do that unless the steel

4042.319 --> 4045.7599999999998
frame is blown up

4047.359 --> 4050.44
like the towers

4051.559 --> 4056.599
right so yeah if you if somebody weren't

4054.14 --> 4057.92
broken home and hope that those planes

4056.599 --> 4059.539
or whatever

4057.92 --> 4061.839
then it would have still just all

4059.539 --> 4061.8390000000004
happened

4062.059 --> 4066.619
and like the story might have changed as

4064.64 --> 4068.66
never would have just said oh two

4066.619 --> 4071.119
terrorists went into the building and

4068.66 --> 4072.859
their blue blew up in those floors and

4071.119 --> 4075.26
then it all pancakes like that they

4072.859 --> 4078.5
would have built it into that story then

4075.26 --> 4081.6800000000003
right no planes

4078.5 --> 4084.319
just people in those buildings being

4081.68 --> 4089.2599999999998
terrorists right

4084.319 --> 4089.2599999999998
because yeah those buildings were rigged

4089.299 --> 4092.14
to blow up

4094.88 --> 4097.839
no matter what

4116.96 --> 4121.64
I still have a photo somewhere on my

4119.12 --> 4124.94
computer of like the

4121.64 --> 4126.859
a piece of the steel frame of the towers

4124.94 --> 4127.94
at the bottom that was like in the

4126.859 --> 4130.88
ground

4127.94 --> 4133.5199999999995
where the the steel was literally like

4130.88 --> 4136.279
like almost cut off with a knife

4133.52 --> 4139.52
perfectly smooth cut

4136.279 --> 4142.040000000001
at ground level guys

4139.52 --> 4143.900000000001
at on the part that was out of the

4142.04 --> 4147.259
ground sticking out of it and it was

4143.9 --> 4149.179
like perfectly diagonally cut giant

4147.259 --> 4150.38
steel beam

4149.179 --> 4153.56
yeah

4150.38 --> 4156.46
yeah that happened because of the fire

4153.56 --> 4159.56
like a hundred or something meters up

4156.46 --> 4163.46
yeah yeah sure that that fire up there

4159.56 --> 4166.219
and and the collapsing that caused

4163.46 --> 4168.44
the steel beam of the giant steel frame

4166.219 --> 4173.06
building at the ground level to be

4168.44 --> 4176.299
diagonally perfectly smooth cut

4173.06 --> 4179.4800000000005
like with with that edge still glowing

4176.299 --> 4182.739
I'm sure that fire a hundred meters up

4179.48 --> 4182.739
caused that yeah

4183.859 --> 4187.4800000000005
I still have that photo

4188.9 --> 4193.16
I put it in like

4190.58 --> 4195.32
my anti-new world order logo which was

4193.16 --> 4198.679
like a

4195.32 --> 4201.88
a thing that I did in 2008 when I was

4198.679 --> 4201.88
really into Infowars

4201.92 --> 4208.1
and there was a forum

4205.219 --> 4209.12
and I had a little like News Bulletin

4208.1 --> 4211.219
thing

4209.12 --> 4214.179
and I made that logo for it let's see if

4211.219 --> 4214.179
I can still find it

4215.12 --> 4217.719
somewhere

4221.36 --> 4226.04
yeah

4223.04 --> 4226.04
no

4228.14 --> 4231.9400000000005
yeah there it is

4233.9 --> 4238.54
yeah I used it in the in the picture

4239.84 --> 4244.179
it's like a banner thing but I'm so

4242.659 --> 4247.28
proud it's like one of the worst thing

4244.179 --> 4249.8
first things I've ever photoshopped took

4247.28 --> 4254.32
me quite some time by the way

4249.8 --> 4254.320000000001
uh let's see can I present this thing

4261.14 --> 4264.820000000001
but I put it in the banner

4268.159 --> 4274.839999999999
not a very high resolution

4271.159 --> 4274.839999999999
so excuse the resolution

4280.159 --> 4285.08
there you go

4281.54 --> 4286.4
right but you can see like on the middle

4285.08 --> 4290.48
right

4286.4 --> 4293.62
there is that that steel beam like

4290.48 --> 4293.62
sticking out of the ground

4293.659 --> 4300.5199999999995
perfect day I'm gonna look up

4296.6 --> 4300.52
that's from the World Trade Center

4305.3 --> 4308.14
put it in there

4321.62 --> 4327.92
I was into Alex Jones when it was still

4324.62 --> 4331.0599999999995
cool and Niche

4327.92 --> 4331.06
I'm special

4350.06 --> 4352.06
um

4355.04 --> 4358.54
okay slow mo

4363.38 --> 4366.92
is anybody still here

4365.42 --> 4370.06
beside you

4366.92 --> 4370.06
let everybody go

4370.699 --> 4376.178999999999
is this entertaining to you did you want

4372.86 --> 4376.179
to know about that or not

4378.62 --> 4384.88
I think that the Heat's finally

4381.8 --> 4384.88
it's starting to go

4399.679 --> 4406.12
okay I'm gonna turn you off

4402.219 --> 4406.12
noisy as [ __ ]

4423.92 --> 4427.9400000000005
come on

4425.179 --> 4430.3
man that fan just keeps blowing like a

4427.94 --> 4430.299999999999
madman

4437.719 --> 4441.28
right uh

4441.8 --> 4447.34
let me report a bit yesterday's flight

4444.02 --> 4447.34
Earth debate was pretty cool

4449.6 --> 4455.42
spot again didn't Chiki get back on I

4452.9 --> 4458.98
think I missed most of that actually

4455.42 --> 4458.9800000000005
it was on on the pre-show

4460.4 --> 4464.62
and probably during the live show

4474.8 --> 4479.659000000001
40 carbon dug in plain sight and I was

4478.1 --> 4483.320000000001
like oh cool

4479.659 --> 4487.28
yeah I was spread well I didn't do that

4483.32 --> 4489.799999999999
but I I was like burning on CDs like

4487.28 --> 4493.12
Alex Jones movie like end game and The

4489.8 --> 4493.12
Obama Deception and

4495.98 --> 4503.32
and then uh and about Chemtrails and

4499.159 --> 4503.32
then pass them out to strangers

4506.96 --> 4511.52
I did do that for a bit

4509.179 --> 4513.7390000000005
but I was really like an Alex Jones

4511.52 --> 4514.780000000001
early activist you know when it was

4513.739 --> 4518.0
still cool

4514.78 --> 4520.659
don't worry about it

4518.0 --> 4520.659
uh

4534.44 --> 4538.12
a hole in the Pentagon

4538.28 --> 4544.179
before it collapsed yeah that was

4540.92 --> 4544.179
ridiculous then it looks

4568.9 --> 4573.04
you know what the weirdest thing was

4574.1 --> 4581.26
I kind of knew it was coming but in the

4577.159 --> 4581.259999999999
dark world because that happened in 97

4581.36 --> 4587.12
and it's like

4584.06 --> 4590.120000000001
Jesuit guy or the devil or whatever the

4587.12 --> 4592.04
[ __ ] it was was like really eager to

4590.12 --> 4594.0199999999995
tell me that it was gonna happen but I

4592.04 --> 4599.26
didn't want to know because I was afraid

4594.02 --> 4599.26
about knowing about plans of the future

4599.3 --> 4603.679
because if you back then at least if

4602.06 --> 4606.820000000001
you're new and you started talking about

4603.679 --> 4606.82
it they would come after you

4606.92 --> 4611.179
so

4608.3 --> 4613.159000000001
but like yeah I've never actually warned

4611.179 --> 4615.4400000000005
anybody ever about it

4613.159 --> 4618.5599999999995
actively because I was scared

4615.44 --> 4620.178999999999
when I saw those things in my visions

4618.56 --> 4622.580000000001
but

4620.179 --> 4627.26
I just wanted to take note that I did

4622.58 --> 4630.82
actually see things about 911 happening

4627.26 --> 4630.820000000001
like in 97.

4630.92 --> 4636.32
and I'm sorry that I couldn't really say

4634.28 --> 4638.86
anything about it I was just way too

4636.32 --> 4638.86
intimidated

4639.26 --> 4642.26
foreign

4653.78 --> 4656.96
[Music]

4668.78 --> 4674.3
like not even intimidated about supposed

4671.86 --> 4675.739
terrorists blowing up a building now

4674.3 --> 4677.42
that's not what I was afraid I was

4675.739 --> 4679.218999999999
afraid of that there

4677.42 --> 4683.42
that there was a group that would just

4679.219 --> 4684.7390000000005
organized to do something that crazy and

4683.42 --> 4687.56
dark

4684.739 --> 4690.218999999999
that's the thing that made me too afraid

4687.56 --> 4690.219
to mention it

4691.179 --> 4696.02
like I've never been afraid of freaking

4693.98 --> 4698.718999999999
terrorists

4696.02 --> 4700.88
like that I'm afraid of like mental

4698.719 --> 4703.82
patients from foreign countries that in

4700.88 --> 4706.12
weren't torn countries like crazy PTSD

4703.82 --> 4706.12
people

4706.4 --> 4709.94
some of those people might have been

4707.659 --> 4712.04
tortured or whatever

4709.94 --> 4714.259999999999
and then they end up in your country

4712.04 --> 4715.28
yeah those can be really [ __ ]

4714.26 --> 4717.8
dangerous

4715.28 --> 4720.8
and like be really

4717.8 --> 4722.84
yeah vile murderers and [ __ ]

4720.8 --> 4725.54
that's what that's the thing that you

4722.84 --> 4727.1
got to be careful about but that that is

4725.54 --> 4729.5
it

4727.1 --> 4731.4800000000005
and by the way that barely even existed

4729.5 --> 4734.56
before 9 11. it's really all the

4731.48 --> 4734.5599999999995
freaking Wars

4735.02 --> 4740.4800000000005
from the West basically

4737.54 --> 4744.04
in the Middle East that have caused all

4740.48 --> 4744.04
these people to come into being

4744.38 --> 4750.679
it traumatized the hell out of them and

4746.84 --> 4752.360000000001
now they're crazy and dangerous

4750.679 --> 4754.219
and they get kicked out of their own

4752.36 --> 4755.599999999999
country or recruited to be in full

4754.219 --> 4757.88
trends

4755.6 --> 4760.58
suicide bombers or whatever it

4757.88 --> 4762.02
supposedly is I don't know

4760.58 --> 4764.739
right

4762.02 --> 4764.7390000000005
so yeah

4765.08 --> 4774.26
but like organized terrorism from

4769.88 --> 4777.92
Middle Eastern countries no no

4774.26 --> 4782.4800000000005
not without it directly being organized

4777.92 --> 4784.159
by spy factions in the West

4782.48 --> 4788.239
because

4784.159 --> 4789.28
like even 40 years ago that was just no

4788.239 --> 4791.178999999999
way

4789.28 --> 4793.34
no way

4791.179 --> 4797.179
that any

4793.34 --> 4800.4800000000005
Middle Eastern or something or whatever

4797.179 --> 4802.58
spy would be able to like actually like

4800.48 --> 4806.0199999999995
get somewhere and then blow something up

4802.58 --> 4806.0199999999995
and not get caught

4806.12 --> 4811.94
like because I'm pretty sure that there

4809.0 --> 4814.219
were plenty that tried and spy agencies

4811.94 --> 4816.44
just stopped all of them

4814.219 --> 4819.08
because they were actually doing what

4816.44 --> 4821.0599999999995
they were supposed to do

4819.08 --> 4824.78
but then

4821.06 --> 4826.580000000001
the agenda has changed and then now all

4824.78 --> 4828.5
these terrorists are suddenly coming

4826.58 --> 4830.42
through oh why would that be yeah that's

4828.5 --> 4833.06
because now they're part of the plan and

4830.42 --> 4836.36
so the spider and just get them all give

4833.06 --> 4838.1
them their equipment instructions

4836.36 --> 4839.839999999999
it's like Ah that's where you go that's

4838.1 --> 4845.7390000000005
where you do that this is how you do

4839.84 --> 4845.7390000000005
that like oh thanks Mrs fight agent

4847.04 --> 4850.36
yeah that's the difference

4857.54 --> 4863.84
I mean there might be like just people

4860.62 --> 4865.04
that spy agency people out there that

4863.84 --> 4867.26
are just like

4865.04 --> 4870.14
looking around the social media looking

4867.26 --> 4871.9400000000005
for people to like estimate when are

4870.14 --> 4875.6
they like ready

4871.94 --> 4878.299999999999
to to go Allahu Akbar and just like blow

4875.6 --> 4880.280000000001
themselves and everybody up and then as

4878.3 --> 4883.219
soon as they think like yeah he's ready

4880.28 --> 4884.9
he's gone far he's so it you can't stand

4883.219 --> 4886.94
this road he's ready to do something

4884.9 --> 4888.98
like that and then it just approached

4886.94 --> 4890.96
them it's like hey you really want to do

4888.98 --> 4892.82
that we can help you

4890.96 --> 4895.2390000000005
and then you can leave all this misery

4892.82 --> 4895.239
behind

4902.42 --> 4906.08
and that's probably how all these

4904.76 --> 4908.659000000001
crazies

4906.08 --> 4911.96
then end up in the news in the latest

4908.659 --> 4914.299999999999
shooting or whatever right

4911.96 --> 4915.92
oh people that have just gone to the

4914.3 --> 4918.5
point where they're like oh I'm ready to

4915.92 --> 4923.0
blow myself up and everybody else and

4918.5 --> 4925.159
it's like oh oh well we have a plan

4923.0 --> 4927.4
and we could really use somebody like

4925.159 --> 4927.4
you

4950.12 --> 4952.84
but

4956.96 --> 4963.7390000000005
my favorite disastrous thespian foreign

4960.64 --> 4966.860000000001
I don't remember I just remember this

4963.739 --> 4968.959999999999
one guy that like on an interview said

4966.86 --> 4971.179
like oh yeah I was there when the

4968.96 --> 4973.9
building collapsed due to structural

4971.179 --> 4978.219
failures of the intense jet fuel fire

4973.9 --> 4982.4
like that [ __ ] that was [ __ ] weird

4978.219 --> 4985.659
like oh yes you might have jumped the

4982.4 --> 4990.259999999999
gun on the script a bit there dude

4985.659 --> 4992.5
it's a little early to to figure that

4990.26 --> 4992.5
out

4994.64 --> 5000.280000000001
well the collapse due to structural fare

4997.34 --> 5003.179
because of the intense jet fuel fire

5000.28 --> 5003.179
okay

5023.5 --> 5027.659
right I'm gonna dig into this real color

5028.6 --> 5030.6
um

5040.59 --> 5043.72
[Music]

5055.5 --> 5062.46
this is Camp vanilla that's a good play

5059.8 --> 5062.46
on this name

5070.179 --> 5075.88
but yes Linux

5072.58 --> 5077.86
I mean even a flat Arthur yesterday

5075.88 --> 5079.92
did an Indian

5077.86 --> 5082.839999999999
or a Hindi video

5079.92 --> 5086.4400000000005
reviewing Nathan Oakley's interview or

5082.84 --> 5090.28
his debate with Jaron

5086.44 --> 5091.54
so that video is going far and wide as I

5090.28 --> 5094.5599999999995
said it would

5091.54 --> 5094.56
I told Jason

5095.26 --> 5103.900000000001
I told Nathan Jason oh God

5098.98 --> 5106.239
the fusion between Nathan and Jason are

5103.9 --> 5109.96
whatever

5106.239 --> 5111.58
Jaren and Nathan Jason don't do that

5109.96 --> 5113.92
right

5111.58 --> 5116.14
and now I lost my train of thought well

5113.92 --> 5117.9400000000005
oh no uh yeah last Friday the day after

5116.14 --> 5119.92
he had that debate with Jaren I told

5117.94 --> 5121.178999999999
Nathan like dude you just won the

5119.92 --> 5123.9400000000005
jackpot

5121.179 --> 5126.34
spiritually and he has and it's proven

5123.94 --> 5129.36
because literally everybody wants to

5126.34 --> 5129.360000000001
review that video

5130.179 --> 5136.4800000000005
like all kinds of people not just flat

5133.179 --> 5139.12
side who does a lot of reviewing that's

5136.48 --> 5142.12
pretty much a Daily Show

5139.12 --> 5143.86
but other people too like that video is

5142.12 --> 5147.9
really hit home

5143.86 --> 5147.9
it was a jackpot it was a home run

5147.94 --> 5154.139999999999
and still spreading

5150.88 --> 5154.14
shredding internationally

5171.94 --> 5176.199
and in general it bodes well it boats

5174.699 --> 5178.659
hope for the

5176.199 --> 5180.94
future

5178.659 --> 5182.62
concerning the restoration of the

5180.94 --> 5184.78
understanding of the original scientific

5182.62 --> 5187.48
method

5184.78 --> 5191.58
that it will survive

5187.48 --> 5191.58
the scientism epidemic

5192.58 --> 5199.08
that really started to bloom like a

5195.219 --> 5199.08
fungus in the 60s

5218.199 --> 5221.699
hello Andy Michael

5227.8 --> 5230.8
laughs

5238.36 --> 5244.719
it was already good oh that is the guy

5241.48 --> 5247.36
the one about the

5244.719 --> 5248.199
of course the tower collapsed because of

5247.36 --> 5251.5599999999995
uh

5248.199 --> 5254.98
structural fare due to the jet fuel

5251.56 --> 5257.620000000001
engine fire uh what

5254.98 --> 5260.339999999999
like somebody opt on the script a bit

5257.62 --> 5260.34
dude

5262.06 --> 5267.719
like he was trying to be a smart ass

5264.88 --> 5267.719
what the [ __ ]

5288.639 --> 5294.52
not one video backing jiren strange no

5291.46 --> 5297.4800000000005
it's not strange that's very

5294.52 --> 5297.4800000000005
relieving

5297.52 --> 5301.7390000000005
that's what it is not

5301.9 --> 5306.339999999999
it's a very pessimistic thing to say

5304.42 --> 5308.56
that it's strange

5306.34 --> 5311.38
I mean not everybody's gonna Double Down

5308.56 --> 5313.900000000001
onto hell okay

5311.38 --> 5316.4800000000005
Still Human

5313.9 --> 5318.719
following bad choices perhaps but still

5316.48 --> 5318.718999999999
human

5323.02 --> 5329.679
so yeah glad go out of it good

5327.4 --> 5332.08
that means it that it's finally going to

5329.679 --> 5335.86
go to a dead end and there and then they

5332.08 --> 5338.639
are forced to stop it or lose interest

5335.86 --> 5338.639
from the public

5339.699 --> 5343.44
probably is already happening

5348.1 --> 5351.189
[Music]

5358.48 --> 5364.678999999999
what

5360.219 --> 5364.679
three hours Lee what

5365.8 --> 5370.56
the hell are you talking about LSG

5388.98 --> 5394.678999999999
sarcasm sorry what sarcasm land Linux

5395.62 --> 5400.599999999999
so you have seen videos back in there

5398.139 --> 5402.52
like could you please not be super

5400.6 --> 5405.52
confusing

5402.52 --> 5405.52
foreign

5423.699 --> 5428.4
I'm sorry I didn't really get that joke

5428.62 --> 5435.54
I don't think it works in text

5431.08 --> 5435.54
I think that's like a vocal joke to make

5447.34 --> 5451.7390000000005
so Len Lennox can we have some clarity

5449.44 --> 5451.739
here

5452.679 --> 5457.139
haven't you seen the video backing jiren

5457.3 --> 5462.219
or you have and there were a lot of them

5460.0 --> 5465.3
and they're stupid so what what is it

5462.219 --> 5465.3
what's the sarcasm

5466.0 --> 5470.52
or is the sarcasm about strange

5472.84 --> 5477.84
can I please have some clarity in my

5475.48 --> 5477.839999999999
chat

5485.98 --> 5488.98
foreign

5490.56 --> 5493.589000000001
[Music]

5510.54 --> 5513.719
sarcasm there

5521.92 --> 5526.84
I thought what you did there worked I

5524.32 --> 5528.699
mean you didn't have to say sarcasm like

5526.84 --> 5530.860000000001
if you say sarcasm that could literally

5528.699 --> 5534.58
if you literally say it then that could

5530.86 --> 5538.259999999999
mean like that everything is reversed so

5534.58 --> 5538.26
it kind of makes it confusing

5547.6 --> 5552.46
I mean if you said like oh man

5551.199 --> 5555.879999999999
well

5552.46 --> 5558.159
we're so getting busted I mean this

5555.88 --> 5560.679
Nathan and Jerry interview has been a

5558.159 --> 5562.719
disaster for fed I don't think we can

5560.679 --> 5564.34
recover from this I mean Jason like

5562.719 --> 5567.219
completely

5564.34 --> 5569.56
crushed Nathan

5567.219 --> 5572.139
like that's the time where you say

5569.56 --> 5574.679
sarcasm

5572.139 --> 5574.679
right

5574.719 --> 5580.06
because it's like literally everything

5577.12 --> 5581.92
is turned inside out dramatically

5580.06 --> 5584.1990000000005
though that's the moment when you should

5581.92 --> 5587.82
probably say sarcasm because otherwise

5584.199 --> 5587.82
it can be really confusing

5595.54 --> 5601.6
what you said was very reasonable

5598.12 --> 5603.639
the way you said it and I mean in my

5601.6 --> 5606.46
opinion even the emoticons were applied

5603.639 --> 5608.4400000000005
correctly I mean serious pondering face

5606.46 --> 5610.36
and then a laughing face like that's

5608.44 --> 5614.4
already a sign like

5610.36 --> 5614.4
I'm being slightly sarcastic

5615.82 --> 5619.0199999999995
so you did it right

5620.159 --> 5624.659
sorry for the micromanagement here

5629.32 --> 5633.78
the what is that supposed to mean Fred

5631.239 --> 5633.78
Sparrow

5635.47 --> 5638.789000000001
[Music]

5653.56 --> 5659.8
oh lisp list yeah that's why you

5658.06 --> 5662.92
shouldn't do that

5659.8 --> 5664.659000000001
I mean speech impediments are not text

5662.92 --> 5667.32
based jokes

5664.659 --> 5667.32
come on

5674.32 --> 5679.0599999999995
unless it's like unavoidable like with

5676.659 --> 5682.739

5679.06 --> 5682.7390000000005
somebody's there Elementary

5683.98 --> 5690.178999999999
well of course that's a

5686.92 --> 5690.179
a Japanese

5690.28 --> 5698.32
uh Sherlock Holmes of course it is

5695.5 --> 5702.6
Japanese Sherlock Holmes which says

5698.32 --> 5702.599999999999
that's Elementary my dear Watson

5707.92 --> 5712.5
I have a few military my dear Watson

5715.26 --> 5719.6990000000005
right PayPal oh

5721.0 --> 5725.679
if you adopt Campanella for Jaron on

5723.82 --> 5729.0599999999995
what the [ __ ] are you what does that

5725.679 --> 5729.06
even mean land Lennox

5734.44 --> 5739.54
if I adopt

5738.159 --> 5741.599999999999
but

5739.54 --> 5741.6
what

5745.0 --> 5752.92
you mean to pass the words company sure

5749.32 --> 5755.5
I mean it's it's a good it's a good uh

5752.92 --> 5757.78
it's a cashier little word

5755.5 --> 5760.36
trick there so yeah of course I'm gonna

5757.78 --> 5762.159
I'm passing it on right now saying it on

5760.36 --> 5764.38
my show I'm pretty sure somebody's gonna

5762.159 --> 5767.259999999999
hear that and then it's gonna like leak

5764.38 --> 5768.32
out so the word is Outland Linux be

5767.26 --> 5771.399
assured that

5768.32 --> 5771.398999999999
[Music]

5773.62 --> 5782.099999999999
he wants the term to become standardized

5777.54 --> 5782.1
well I can't promise that

5782.739 --> 5788.739
but I'm pretty sure that like QE is

5785.8 --> 5790.360000000001
gonna when if QE hears it he is probably

5788.739 --> 5791.678999999999
gonna standardize it because it is

5790.36 --> 5796.0
really good

5791.679 --> 5798.46
it's like gerane scampanella right

5796.0 --> 5802.62
I mean he's gonna love that one

5798.46 --> 5805.54
so I'm pretty sure that uh your little

5802.62 --> 5808.5599999999995
your little name jog will will probably

5805.54 --> 5811.659
become standardized

5808.56 --> 5814.360000000001
I can't make it standard I can't make

5811.659 --> 5817.179
something more popular than it will be

5814.36 --> 5820.299999999999
like it hits or it doesn't hit right

5817.179 --> 5824.56
just like the word rumpusing

5820.3 --> 5827.62
like nobody decided that that was

5824.56 --> 5829.719
gonna work and like become a permanent

5827.62 --> 5833.5
vernacular type thing

5829.719 --> 5837.219
it just happened it just worked nobody

5833.5 --> 5840.52
was like yeah oh I got the new word to

5837.219 --> 5842.679
to describe this no no it just started

5840.52 --> 5844.719
happening and then it just it was just

5842.679 --> 5845.56
suddenly standard and now everybody uses

5844.719 --> 5846.699
that

5845.56 --> 5849.04
foreign

5846.699 --> 5852.04
because it's literally quicker to say

5849.04 --> 5854.82
rumpusing than to describe the specifics

5852.04 --> 5854.82
of the action

5855.219 --> 5858.719
and that's just how it works

5863.56 --> 5868.02
right what's a good one I like it

5869.84 --> 5874.3
[Music]

5871.659 --> 5877.36
may be better to attack his claims

5874.3 --> 5879.72
through though as they are more

5877.36 --> 5881.739
ridiculous

5879.72 --> 5884.860000000001
[Applause]

5881.739 --> 5888.04
yes love because that's fair enough

5884.86 --> 5891.16
as a standard that's a good approach

5888.04 --> 5893.62
however I mean

5891.16 --> 5896.139
[Music]

5893.62 --> 5899.34
at some point you gotta realize that

5896.139 --> 5902.9800000000005
just like attacking somebody that's

5899.34 --> 5904.54
provably clinically [ __ ] it it kind

5902.98 --> 5907.959999999999
of becomes

5904.54 --> 5912.719
at some point it just becomes bullying

5907.96 --> 5912.719
it's like I don't understand

5913.98 --> 5918.82
it's like you're not gonna like you

5917.02 --> 5925.84
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're [ __ ] stupid

5918.82 --> 5929.98
like no I don't understand yeah sorry uh

5925.84 --> 5931.179
I know maybe later you know like you're

5929.98 --> 5933.638999999999
not gonna

5931.179 --> 5935.5
like Bully them that's just rude and

5933.639 --> 5939.06
that's just how I'm starting to feel

5935.5 --> 5939.06
about Jared more and more now

5939.1 --> 5945.719
it's like

5941.44 --> 5945.719
if you're gonna argue like that then

5946.659 --> 5953.5599999999995
you gotta be re-categorized

5950.28 --> 5957.04
intellectually socially like you you

5953.56 --> 5961.96
can't just say those things

5957.04 --> 5964.96
and remain an intellectual equal

5961.96 --> 5966.34
so garen's effectively re-categorized

5964.96 --> 5968.679
himself

5966.34 --> 5973.54
and yeah I mean at some point it's just

5968.679 --> 5975.639
pointless to to attack a [ __ ] verbally

5973.54 --> 5978.4
right because they say stupid things

5975.639 --> 5980.6990000000005
because they're a [ __ ] you should be

5978.4 --> 5983.62
expect at some point it's actually

5980.699 --> 5985.78
Dumber of the smarter person to keep

5983.62 --> 5986.98
doing the same thing when you should

5985.78 --> 5989.639
know better

5986.98 --> 5989.638999999999
right

5993.639 --> 5998.92
so it's like the conclusion watching

5995.8 --> 6003.0
that is like oh damn

5998.92 --> 6004.86
okay I guess garen's [ __ ]

6003.0 --> 6007.88
and Petty

6004.86 --> 6007.88
like a little kid

6008.82 --> 6013.259999999999
and he can't admit when he's wrong

6011.46 --> 6015.179
and he double speaks because of it and

6013.26 --> 6018.4800000000005
he doesn't even realize it or he doesn't

6015.179 --> 6021.679
want to it Fubar and and that's just

6018.48 --> 6021.678999999999
like yeah after that point

6024.179 --> 6031.32
like the fault is yours for

6028.58 --> 6033.179
approaching him with the expectation

6031.32 --> 6036.5599999999995
that he's going to be on the same level

6033.179 --> 6036.56
as you you see

6037.52 --> 6045.320000000001
that's your estimation

6041.34 --> 6048.179
fault at that point

6045.32 --> 6050.34
for my efforts thanks thanks Linda Knox

6048.179 --> 6053.12
I really appreciate support check my

6050.34 --> 6053.12
PayPal right now

6059.42 --> 6064.5
oh what was that yeah

6066.0 --> 6071.179
thank you for the support really

6067.62 --> 6071.179
appreciate that very helpful

6072.719 --> 6074.719
um

6082.26 --> 6085.1
excellent

6097.739 --> 6103.98
right so yeah

6100.28 --> 6105.599999999999
to get back to the last

6103.98 --> 6107.099999999999
last role about this and then I'm

6105.6 --> 6109.4400000000005
probably gonna round out the show man

6107.1 --> 6111.780000000001
the time has flown I guess I've been

6109.44 --> 6113.879999999999
having fun I still have to figure out a

6111.78 --> 6116.94
title though but yeah better attack his

6113.88 --> 6119.159000000001
claims but

6116.94 --> 6120.719
at the same time it's kind of pointless

6119.159 --> 6122.759999999999
too I mean

6120.719 --> 6124.56
maybe the basic preface should

6122.76 --> 6128.06
definitely be cleared up science does

6124.56 --> 6128.06
prove things it's proof the

6128.34 --> 6132.42
that it causes something or that it

6130.5 --> 6133.98
doesn't cost something and so

6132.42 --> 6136.08
something's always proven and there's

6133.98 --> 6139.199
nothing that can change that right

6136.08 --> 6142.139
but like keep it to that

6139.199 --> 6144.839999999999
don't go look at all but Jaren said that

6142.139 --> 6146.639
oh now he says the up like yeah it just

6144.84 --> 6148.8
means he double speaks and there's no

6146.639 --> 6151.88
point at trying to keep track because

6148.8 --> 6154.679
he's never gonna fix that later on like

6151.88 --> 6157.02
Jaron is not gonna review his own

6154.679 --> 6160.1990000000005
performance and then fix

6157.02 --> 6162.659000000001
what he said you see

6160.199 --> 6165.599999999999
that's the problem

6162.659 --> 6167.46
so there's no point even trying to hold

6165.6 --> 6169.56
him accountable to anything because he

6167.46 --> 6171.0
doesn't hold himself accountable to

6169.56 --> 6173.1
anything he said

6171.0 --> 6175.94
he won't hold himself accountable for

6173.1 --> 6175.9400000000005
his own double speak

6176.58 --> 6182.179
so why should you why should you take

6179.1 --> 6182.179
him serious at all

6185.28 --> 6190.0199999999995
ah yeah thanks Richard G I enjoyed the

6188.34 --> 6192.900000000001
show too but I am gonna round it out

6190.02 --> 6195.2390000000005
soon uh but how am I

6192.9 --> 6200.0
somebody help me out with the title I

6195.239 --> 6200.0
thought I thought put Star Wars in there

6215.4 --> 6218.48
what else

6219.719 --> 6224.639
yeah 911 but it's a bit risky if I put

6222.78 --> 6227.3
that in the title

6224.639 --> 6227.3
what else

6227.4 --> 6233.78
yeah a bunch of movies

6230.04 --> 6233.78
we started talking about it

6238.8 --> 6242.6990000000005
the 911 talk was a kind of interesting

6241.38 --> 6245.639
though

6242.699 --> 6248.54
and jerrane of course

6245.639 --> 6248.54
uh

6255.12 --> 6258.96
[Applause]

6256.14 --> 6262.38
[Music]

6258.96 --> 6266.4800000000005
yeah and I can't put it in there

6262.38 --> 6266.4800000000005
no it's mostly the footage isn't it

6281.86 --> 6284.95
[Applause]

6293.3 --> 6296.659000000001
[Music]

6294.48 --> 6298.799999999999
maybe I should do that

6296.659 --> 6301.08
thinking like Star Wars A New Hope

6298.8 --> 6305.6
without Nostalgia goals

6301.08 --> 6305.6
and this Campanelli brand

6309.54 --> 6316.46
then at least I directly put your

6313.679 --> 6316.46
your thing

6316.9 --> 6320.11
[Music]

6329.54 --> 6335.6
[Music]

6331.739 --> 6335.599999999999
yes it fits exactly

6344.52 --> 6348.92
tell me what you think guys I just

6349.8 --> 6356.900000000001
it should be there now maybe refresh the

6352.32 --> 6356.9
page what do you think does this work

6374.78 --> 6381.739
[Music]

6377.699 --> 6381.739
what's that I'll just here

6384.98 --> 6390.08

6390.119 --> 6395.099999999999
the nice CGI prop all the way to the

6393.42 --> 6398.3
Moon

6395.1 --> 6398.3
looks very good

6400.98 --> 6405.959999999999
it looks better than a hobo Fortress

6403.44 --> 6410.0
from the United States

6405.96 --> 6410.0
with plenty of solar panel

6410.76 --> 6418.219
nice looking golden bubble

6414.96 --> 6418.219
yes that should work

6421.26 --> 6424.52
Moon Curry

6426.84 --> 6432.96
no I don't think it's safe to eat curry

6429.36 --> 6436.5599999999995
in outer space you know

6432.96 --> 6438.179
your body may not like it and then you

6436.56 --> 6441.8
know what happens

6438.179 --> 6441.8
not recommendable

6449.159 --> 6453.5
right

6451.08 --> 6456.6
