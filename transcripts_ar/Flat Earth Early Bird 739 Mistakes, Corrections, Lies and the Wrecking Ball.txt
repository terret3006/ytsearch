i would normally say oh gofundme but

106.079 --> 108.32
it's

help better because

115.92 --> 118.96000000000001
thanks to what dank did the other day i

118.56 --> 120.96000000000001
was

118.96 --> 123.19999999999999
literally because of that i was able to

120.96 --> 125.03999999999999
just get the solid state drive

123.2 --> 127.43900000000001
didn't have to erect any page of

125.04 --> 127.43900000000001
anything

127.6 --> 131.599
so that was actually much much easier to

130.16 --> 135.35999999999999
do it that way

131.599 --> 139.51999999999998
right and no loss of money whatsoever so

135.36 --> 139.52
all right please do keep supporting me

140.879 --> 146.64
in my daily endeavor everyday show

144.319 --> 147.599
two hours how many people out there do

146.64 --> 151.35999999999999
you know have a

147.599 --> 154.39999999999998
two hour show every single day

151.36 --> 156.959
every single day

154.4 --> 157.44
could you find me one could you find me

156.959 --> 159.92000000000002
one

157.44 --> 161.12
that does that and when i mean one i

159.92 --> 163.92
mean literally

161.12 --> 165.12
one one other person in the world that

163.92 --> 167.67999999999998
freaking does that

165.12 --> 169.28
that would be cool because i'm sure

167.68 --> 171.28
there's people like on radio that are

169.28 --> 173.84
like doing that but

171.28 --> 174.64000000000001
i've not really come across any that

173.84 --> 177.28
were

174.64 --> 177.92
that actually did have a point and and

177.28 --> 179.599
all that

177.92 --> 181.35999999999999
they would not just blah blah blah play

179.599 --> 182.48
standard records and all that right

181.36 --> 184.64000000000001
which i don't do

182.48 --> 186.159
i don't have a standard program i it's

184.64 --> 188.55999999999997
literally me talking

186.159 --> 189.84
literally me talking every freaking day

188.56 --> 192.8
for two hours

189.84 --> 194.159
right so if you can find anybody else

192.8 --> 196.64000000000001
out there

194.159 --> 198.319
you know that would be interesting to

196.64 --> 201.44
learn about

198.319 --> 203.44
but i doubt it and i think that's a

201.44 --> 204.879
that it's that i'm a big frustration to

203.44 --> 206.319
a lot of people because yesterday for

204.879 --> 209.67999999999998
the first time again

206.319 --> 212.72
i thought let's see what happens when a

209.68 --> 214.239
youtube search the name arwin wasn't

212.72 --> 217.519
that interesting

214.239 --> 220.959
right well at least right on top at the

217.519 --> 224.239
at the top was was my account

220.959 --> 226.239
like you saw the ebony tree my name

224.239 --> 228.239
right on top so that's good at least

226.239 --> 229.36
they're fair enough to put my channel on

228.239 --> 233.28
top

229.36 --> 236.959
and then immediately preceding that were

233.28 --> 238.48
i think around 40 different nasty troll

236.959 --> 241.84
videos

238.48 --> 245.11999999999998
like ranging from me clips from me being

241.84 --> 248.64000000000001
very pissed off like like 82 [ __ ]

245.12 --> 252.0
and all that to literally photos of me

248.64 --> 254.72
when i was sad when they they literally

252.0 --> 255.2
actually in paint have drawn tears on

254.72 --> 257.919
that

255.2 --> 259.03999999999996
it's it's real proud work there from

257.919 --> 261.75899999999996
these trolls they

259.04 --> 264.639
really need that i guess they really

261.759 --> 267.84000000000003
need to see arwen all crumbly and they

264.639 --> 268.24
so they they're literally making art of

267.84 --> 271.52
my

268.24 --> 274.88
being of my image as

271.52 --> 275.28
a sad losing shriveling icon like they

274.88 --> 278.96
need

275.28 --> 282.0
an icon of me to imagine that i'm

278.96 --> 284.63899999999995
failing i'm apparently that

282.0 --> 286.24
that painful to people that they are

284.639 --> 288.72
making videos

286.24 --> 289.68
just like that it's really bizarre to

288.72 --> 291.759
see it's like

289.68 --> 294.16
wow it's almost like people are building

291.759 --> 297.44
statues of you

294.16 --> 300.47900000000004
being i don't know impilled by a spear

297.44 --> 301.44
of light or like crying in desperation

300.479 --> 303.59999999999997
on the knees like

301.44 --> 305.199
people are doing that of me for some

303.6 --> 308.47900000000004
reason

305.199 --> 310.88
and it's really bizarre because

308.479 --> 311.52
yeah everybody has a troll video of them

310.88 --> 314.639
you know

311.52 --> 318.4
somewhere but this

314.639 --> 320.08
it's like what really i'm

318.4 --> 322.32
i make that much of an impact that

320.08 --> 326.08
people are actually going to

322.32 --> 328.24
make icons of me not to worship me but

326.08 --> 329.28
to basically stop scoff at me it's

328.24 --> 331.68
almost like

329.28 --> 332.79999999999995
like what happens with trump you know

331.68 --> 335.24
with trump it's like

332.8 --> 336.8
mechanized though it's like literally

335.24 --> 340.16
industrialized

336.8 --> 343.919
ridicules orange man bad and that's so

340.16 --> 346.16
ingrained in everything so ingrained

343.919 --> 348.0
that yeah that that is bigger of course

346.16 --> 350.88000000000005
of course it's very logical

348.0 --> 352.08
right but i'm just this guy in the

350.88 --> 356.24
netherlands on the

352.08 --> 359.44
internet and i got like

356.24 --> 362.8
40 different

359.44 --> 364.8
really nasty troll videos about me like

362.8 --> 366.0
it's not just one video spread around no

364.8 --> 369.36
it's like 40

366.0 --> 371.199
like there's people thousands of hours

369.36 --> 375.28000000000003
have been spent

371.199 --> 379.6
to try and ridicule me

375.28 --> 382.479
like wow that's i must be making

379.6 --> 383.68
quite a big impact i think that that's

382.479 --> 386.0
all happening

383.68 --> 388.24
and i don't even realize it i'm just

386.0 --> 390.56
doing my show being myself upholding my

388.24 --> 394.24
principles following the path

390.56 --> 397.6
being very strict nowadays and

394.24 --> 398.319
yeah trying to help everybody with the

397.6 --> 400.88
truth

398.319 --> 401.6
including especially the uncomfortable

400.88 --> 403.28
truth

401.6 --> 405.44
and not just the uncomfortable truth

403.28 --> 408.71999999999997
that the earth is flat and not a globe

405.44 --> 412.88
that that's all a lie no no all the the

408.72 --> 416.16
really personal up close

412.88 --> 419.039
rarely spoken about truths for people

416.16 --> 419.59900000000005
that they must face inside to actually

419.039 --> 422.31899999999996
ascend

419.599 --> 423.759
and that people don't tell them anymore

422.319 --> 425.599
those truths

423.759 --> 426.96000000000004
now of course speaking about those

425.599 --> 430.319
truths typically

426.96 --> 432.84
will trigger people to no end they

430.319 --> 434.319
it's like they go into this weird

432.84 --> 436.96
ritualistic

434.319 --> 438.24
spiral where they literally start making

436.96 --> 441.44
art

438.24 --> 444.0
to try and defend themselves from

441.44 --> 445.52
getting awoken and i think that many of

444.0 --> 450.08
these troll videos are probably the

445.52 --> 451.84
result of that

450.08 --> 454.15999999999997
right yeah zapped happy isn't that just

451.84 --> 457.44
silly but eventually though

454.16 --> 459.44
underneath those what is it 40 videos

457.44 --> 461.52
then the early bird shows do pop up

459.44 --> 465.36
right

461.52 --> 468.79999999999995
so yeah that's very special like

465.36 --> 471.68
there's i guess

468.8 --> 473.039
a huge amount of people out there that

471.68 --> 475.599
there's a market for

473.039 --> 476.71999999999997
our win hate there's a market for our

475.599 --> 479.28
win hatred

476.72 --> 481.03900000000004
that's funny that's i think that's funny

479.28 --> 483.19899999999996
you know why i think that's funny

481.039 --> 485.039
because it doesn't phase me in the

483.199 --> 488.16
slightest i don't give a [ __ ]

485.039 --> 490.4
all these people are pathetic they they

488.16 --> 492.0
are pathetic because they are spending

490.4 --> 495.19899999999996
time and energy

492.0 --> 497.759
and their channel on ridiculing videos

495.199 --> 499.759
about a guy talking about flat earth in

497.759 --> 503.84000000000003
the netherlands

499.759 --> 505.84000000000003
like what a guy that doesn't even have 2

503.84 --> 506.23999999999995
000 subscribers on his channel and i

505.84 --> 509.28
have

506.24 --> 510.0
40 ridiculing videos from different

509.28 --> 513.039
people

510.0 --> 515.039
how bizarre is that right so i'm not

513.039 --> 516.479
afraid or even faced in the slightest

515.039 --> 517.36
anymore you know i was a little worried

516.479 --> 520.0
at first

517.36 --> 520.8000000000001
a little worried like wow i get i'm so

520.0 --> 523.039
unpopular

520.8 --> 524.959
what do i do nathan help me he's like no

523.039 --> 526.959
no this is all good man this is

524.959 --> 529.8389999999999
this is good for you and i'm like what

526.959 --> 533.3599999999999
what oh it's okay

529.839 --> 535.7600000000001
okay a little unnerving

533.36 --> 537.279
nerving at first but now i'm used to it

535.76 --> 540.959
and

537.279 --> 543.4399999999999
yeah these people i guess are just

540.959 --> 545.4399999999999
i don't know what sometimes now i

543.44 --> 548.0
imagine like all these people are just

545.44 --> 550.48
on the brink of suicide and they are

548.0 --> 552.959
using me as a distraction and

550.48 --> 553.6
all that has to happen is me addressing

552.959 --> 556.3199999999999
them

553.6 --> 557.839
like for real and then doing this and

556.32 --> 560.839
they're dead

557.839 --> 562.32
and they'll end themselves like i can't

560.839 --> 564.48
imagine what

562.32 --> 566.32
other type of state of mind you'd be in

564.48 --> 569.76
to do all that

566.32 --> 571.12
right like you got to be pretty damn

569.76 --> 573.36
feeble-minded

571.12 --> 575.92
and feeble-hearted if you're going to

573.36 --> 577.6
spend so much time on ridiculing videos

575.92 --> 579.92
about some random guy

577.6 --> 582.08
on the internet with less than 2 000

579.92 --> 585.5999999999999
subscribers in the netherlands

582.08 --> 585.6
you got to be pretty [ __ ] up

586.8 --> 590.8
yes i did manage to turn on baldur's

588.8 --> 592.0
buildersgate 3. i wanted to address that

590.8 --> 595.519
today

592.0 --> 597.36
i was very pissed off yesterday about

595.519 --> 599.519
baldur's gate 3 situation and the

597.36 --> 601.6800000000001
company gog

599.519 --> 602.64
and what how they replied to me like oh

601.68 --> 605.279
we we might

602.64 --> 607.4399999999999
not be able to return calls for like a

605.279 --> 609.68
month because of coroner

607.44 --> 610.5600000000001
right i was really livid and told them i

609.68 --> 613.04
want my money back

610.56 --> 614.3199999999999
i got a response really quickly really

613.04 --> 617.68
quickly

614.32 --> 618.1600000000001
and then even yesterday thanks to i

617.68 --> 620.959
don't know

618.16 --> 623.4399999999999
what you george sanford it was you it

620.959 --> 625.8389999999999
was you you gave me that link

623.44 --> 627.12
and in there there was a couple of very

625.839 --> 630.24
basic tips

627.12 --> 630.88
on how to start it up and it worked i

630.24 --> 632.88
worked like

630.88 --> 634.72
immediately so i can now start up

632.88 --> 638.079
baldur's gate 3

634.72 --> 641.279
and it's still in the development phase

638.079 --> 642.16
i didn't know that like i thought it was

641.279 --> 645.279
just out

642.16 --> 648.399
and i basically yeah send the gog

645.279 --> 652.0
team the support team and email back

648.399 --> 653.519
like okay okay uh yeah let me retract my

652.0 --> 654.88
previous statement about wanting my

653.519 --> 657.68
money back

654.88 --> 658.079
it's all right now the gog program is

657.68 --> 661.5999999999999
still

658.079 --> 663.1999999999999
freaking useless and yeah it should be

661.6 --> 664.399
fixed as soon as possible at least i can

663.2 --> 667.9200000000001
play the game

664.399 --> 670.0
so yeah dx11

667.92 --> 672.959
xa in the folder that's right exactly

670.0 --> 675.6
that one yep

672.959 --> 677.5189999999999
yeah i didn't realize i could just start

675.6 --> 678.48
it up directly i thought like oh they

677.519 --> 680.88
are

678.48 --> 682.48
like railroading us through that gog

680.88 --> 684.56
program like you have to do that but

682.48 --> 687.04
apparently it's not true

684.56 --> 687.76
which makes it kind of weird because

687.04 --> 689.519
like why

687.76 --> 691.92
is that program even there it seems

689.519 --> 693.36
completely superfluous it's like a 500

691.92 --> 696.64
megabyte program

693.36 --> 700.24
just to start up other things and you

696.64 --> 700.24
don't even technically need it it's

700.839 --> 706.24
right so anyway

704.0 --> 707.92
i don't really care about the details i

706.24 --> 710.0
just managed to start it up

707.92 --> 712.24
that's steam yeah well this is not steam

710.0 --> 715.76
this is gog it's not steam

712.24 --> 718.72
i had this steam option i bypassed on it

715.76 --> 718.72
no steam i don't

718.959 --> 725.5189999999999
i went for the gog

722.0 --> 728.8
because glg is also i think

725.519 --> 731.6
the same group that uh

728.8 --> 732.56
that made the other baldur gate baldur's

731.6 --> 736.399
gate

732.56 --> 739.1999999999999
uh rebooted like they modernized

736.399 --> 739.76
those games with like so that you can

739.2 --> 742.24
play it

739.76 --> 744.16
really smoothly on modern computers

742.24 --> 746.16
because they're kind of older games

744.16 --> 748.3199999999999
so they fix them up and i really

746.16 --> 750.079
appreciate that i appreciate that so

748.32 --> 752.24
much that they did that

750.079 --> 753.76
that i'm literally willing to just give

752.24 --> 755.2
them money

753.76 --> 757.12
even though i could have probably just

755.2 --> 759.2
downloaded the game in retrospect for

757.12 --> 762.24
free and just play it like that but

759.2 --> 764.8000000000001
i just think that i think that they're

762.24 --> 765.92
i like what they do i just don't like

764.8 --> 768.399
this

765.92 --> 769.36
broken stupid interface thing that's

768.399 --> 772.079
stupid

769.36 --> 775.36
right so at that yeah sort of a

772.079 --> 778.56
correction from yesterday it was fixed

775.36 --> 782.0
and things are fine the game is still

778.56 --> 785.279
it's it's not very easy to to play it

782.0 --> 786.079
in the sense that the graphics is kind

785.279 --> 789.279
of

786.079 --> 791.68
choppy but

789.279 --> 792.48
from what i've been able to do so far it

791.68 --> 795.76
was at least

792.48 --> 797.6
promising and interesting it really does

795.76 --> 801.76
look like neverwinter nights to

797.6 --> 804.399
some kind of advanced version with more

801.76 --> 805.36
visual interactions is a lot of like

804.399 --> 809.279
it's very

805.36 --> 812.639
built up like cut scenes in many ways

809.279 --> 813.04
but yeah we'll see where we get with the

812.639 --> 814.72
game

813.04 --> 817.1999999999999
you know it's still in development i

814.72 --> 820.399
have it i have the rights to it

817.2 --> 821.839
with that and yeah i don't know if i'm

820.399 --> 826.839
gonna be playing it a lot

821.839 --> 829.839
but at least i got it and then later i

826.839 --> 829.839
can

830.0 --> 836.399
fox get the shut up

834.079 --> 838.7199999999999
tara that's ridiculous why would you say

836.399 --> 841.04

making a muck

856.8 --> 860.0
these people here are well behaved

858.72 --> 861.6800000000001
enough and that's why they're in the

860.0 --> 862.72

865.76 --> 871.519
yeah but it's not funny it's not funny

868.8 --> 872.399

871.519 --> 874.88

872.399 --> 876.959
it's stupid don't act like a freaking

874.88 --> 878.88

and yesterday oh what a long weekend it

962.639 --> 966.399
was

963.519 --> 966.399
a long weekend

966.8 --> 973.04
man yesterday three and a half hour show

970.0 --> 975.6
how crazy is that three and a half hours

973.04 --> 976.56
it's the longest show i've ever done

975.6 --> 979.839
ever

976.56 --> 982.2399999999999
since i started up the channel didn't

979.839 --> 985.36
expect it would be that long but yeah

982.24 --> 987.6
when you think you're gonna round out

985.36 --> 989.12
you think it got kind of boring and then

987.6 --> 991.6
this freak

989.12 --> 991.6
comes in

992.16 --> 999.04
this weirdo tony guy who is much

996.0 --> 1001.68
much worse than i've even anticipated

999.04 --> 1002.16
right and it's it's kind of weird

1001.68 --> 1004.3199999999999
because

1002.16 --> 1006.079
this is typical arwenian thing again i

1004.32 --> 1009.36
have not even watched him i have not

1006.079 --> 1011.5999999999999
heard a single thing of his voice

1009.36 --> 1013.759
except for the ice shitty comments in

1011.6 --> 1014.72
chat and his spam and it's basically are

1013.759 --> 1018.5600000000001
you afraid

1014.72 --> 1021.839
the total safari syndrome like classic

1018.56 --> 1022.4799999999999
safonya syndrome it's classic except

1021.839 --> 1025.76
this guy

1022.48 --> 1027.1200000000001
is just so deep into it it looks like

1025.76 --> 1029.439
he's in a full-blown

1027.12 --> 1030.6399999999999
psychosis stuck in savage mode and he's

1029.439 --> 1033.679
never coming out again

1030.64 --> 1037.6000000000001
like ever in his real life either this

1033.679 --> 1040.88
this guy is quite literally in hell

1037.6 --> 1044.7199999999998
in hell in hell itself like his

1040.88 --> 1045.679
his being is displaced in a fantasy

1044.72 --> 1048.88
frequency

1045.679 --> 1049.6000000000001
where he is literally in hell think

1048.88 --> 1052.72
about

1049.6 --> 1055.9189999999999
like the animations of say

1052.72 --> 1057.76
diablo ii he is there

1055.919 --> 1058.96
that is happening around him he is

1057.76 --> 1062.32
literally in hell

1058.96 --> 1065.3600000000001
and he's never coming out again ever

1062.32 --> 1067.2
and it's quite sad that

1065.36 --> 1068.559
certain individual that i've known for a

1067.2 --> 1071.919
long time

1068.559 --> 1076.08
has been hooked and is stuck in hell

1071.919 --> 1080.4
right there with him it's very pathetic

1076.08 --> 1083.84
very very pathetic

1080.4 --> 1086.88
and atrocious to me and that's why i

1083.84 --> 1090.0
basically exercised him cut

1086.88 --> 1090.72
kicked him out of the early jet took his

1090.0 --> 1094.08
wrench here

1090.72 --> 1096.48
because he's completely unreliable

1094.08 --> 1097.28
he's now whether he knows it or not he's

1096.48 --> 1100.0
a spy

1097.28 --> 1100.799
he's a spy and he's [ __ ] out of his

1100.0 --> 1102.64
mind

1100.799 --> 1105.6
and you all know i'm talking about good

1102.64 --> 1108.24
servant it's really sad

1105.6 --> 1109.12
that this happened he's completely out

1108.24 --> 1110.96
of his mind and

1109.12 --> 1112.3999999999999
he cannot be trusted he might be i'm

1110.96 --> 1112.88
just trying to be nice and trying to

1112.4 --> 1116.16
help

1112.88 --> 1119.8400000000001
he's spying he's spying he does not have

1116.16 --> 1123.8400000000001
control over what he does anymore

1119.84 --> 1123.84
so beware of that

1126.4 --> 1130.3200000000002
and yeah the i was quite sad about that

1129.76 --> 1133.76
because

1130.32 --> 1137.28
i really i confided in the guy

1133.76 --> 1142.799
i just told you zaptapi i just

1137.28 --> 1151.84

that i literally don't know about

he can't be a gatekeeper he doesn't have

1451.84 --> 1457.279

1454.559 --> 1458.48

1457.279 --> 1461.76
things in his past he

1458.48 --> 1464.799

1516.559 --> 1520.3999999999999
same

1517.12 --> 1522.799
he's just more nasty that's all

1520.4 --> 1523.44
it's just a fat i don't know what he

1522.799 --> 1525.6
looks like

1523.44 --> 1527.2
he's just a disgusting piece of [ __ ] i

1525.6 --> 1528.8799999999999
don't give a [ __ ] what he does

1527.2 --> 1530.72
he can [ __ ] kill himself for a lie

1528.88 --> 1532.48
care he probably should

1530.72 --> 1534.799
and he'd save a lot of people a lot of

1532.48 --> 1537.1200000000001
pain because he's a [ __ ] scumbag that

1534.799 --> 1539.2
destroys people's lives

1537.12 --> 1541.1999999999998
per default because he has nothing

1539.2 --> 1545.44
better to do with his [ __ ] up life

1541.2 --> 1550.159
right since he's just

1545.44 --> 1550.159
attacking everybody right

1550.72 --> 1554.559
yes hi amanda young yeah you missed

1552.88 --> 1557.8400000000001
everything

1554.559 --> 1557.84
you missed everything

1564.159 --> 1567.919
two more names added to your blog list

1565.84 --> 1571.039
okay rob h that's fine

1567.919 --> 1573.039
well look good servant is not evil he's

1571.039 --> 1576.24
just completely lost it

1573.039 --> 1578.32
he is like a mind control slave or an mk

1576.24 --> 1580.159
ultra slave it's very similar to mk

1578.32 --> 1582.1589999999999
ultra what happened to him

1580.159 --> 1584.72
it's like heavy indoctrination where he

1582.159 --> 1587.1200000000001
literally just loses his mind it's like

1584.72 --> 1589.2
he he probably believes that this tony

1587.12 --> 1591.4399999999998
guy is the only one

1589.2 --> 1593.2
in the world right now that is going to

1591.44 --> 1596.799
take down

1593.2 --> 1597.3600000000001
actual pedophiles and like nasty people

1596.799 --> 1599.039
he

1597.36 --> 1601.039
actually believes that this

1599.039 --> 1604.48
[ __ ] creep

1601.039 --> 1606.1589999999999
is going to do anything anything at all

1604.48 --> 1608.4
except what he's doing right now and

1606.159 --> 1610.0
that is just slandering and [ __ ] and

1608.4 --> 1612.4
vomiting over everybody

1610.0 --> 1613.12
that's the only thing he ever does and

1612.4 --> 1615.039
will do

1613.12 --> 1617.039
you really think this guy is gonna take

1615.039 --> 1620.24
some kind of physical action

1617.039 --> 1624.24
or like get lawyers and sue people no

1620.24 --> 1625.84
he's a [ __ ] scumbag piece of [ __ ]

1624.24 --> 1627.44
and if you believe he's gonna do

1625.84 --> 1630.9599999999998
anything other than

1627.44 --> 1634.24
just [ __ ] on people on the internet

1630.96 --> 1635.919
you're in for a real treat because yeah

1634.24 --> 1637.919
you are going to be part of that

1635.919 --> 1640.24
[ __ ] cycle and in the end

1637.919 --> 1642.3990000000001
you might or might not realize that he's

1640.24 --> 1644.96
never ever going to do something not

1642.399 --> 1649.12
even in a [ __ ] 20 years

1644.96 --> 1652.0
right and good servant fell for it

1649.12 --> 1652.4799999999998
it's really really sad i tried to warn

1652.0 --> 1654.96
him

1652.48 --> 1657.76
he did not listen and now he's lost his

1654.96 --> 1657.76
[ __ ] mind

1660.14 --> 1663.259
[Music]

1667.76 --> 1670.96
way behind are we been working for four

1669.84 --> 1672.559
months now yeah

1670.96 --> 1674.3990000000001
well then you got a problem because

1672.559 --> 1677.6789999999999
there's a lot of things happening here

1674.399 --> 1679.279
a lot and a three hour three and a half

1677.679 --> 1681.279
hour show yesterday

1679.279 --> 1682.399
and a three hour show the day before

1681.279 --> 1685.039
that

1682.399 --> 1688.0
and i have a two hour show every day now

1685.039 --> 1689.84
and it's not gonna be any less

1688.0 --> 1692.0
and there's a there's just a lot of

1689.84 --> 1696.32
things happening constantly

1692.0 --> 1699.36
constantly so

1696.32 --> 1700.399
yeah maybe you could just chat with some

1699.36 --> 1703.76
of the people

1700.399 --> 1705.52
like they'll tell you

1703.76 --> 1707.279
they'll give you summaries of the things

1705.52 --> 1708.96
that have happened

1707.279 --> 1710.88
but anyway i got a news i got a new

1708.96 --> 1713.8400000000001
internet stalker again

1710.88 --> 1714.3990000000001
and he basically took the mind of my

1713.84 --> 1717.039
friend

1714.399 --> 1717.4399999999998
good servant away and now yeah i lost a

1717.039 --> 1720.0
friend

1717.44 --> 1720.0
because of that

1722.72 --> 1728.96
and that sucks it hurt

1726.08 --> 1732.08
although i'll get over it i'm just

1728.96 --> 1733.919
really [ __ ] disappointed about it

1732.08 --> 1735.1999999999998
because i thought that the guy like i

1733.919 --> 1738.3200000000002
thought i could really

1735.2 --> 1740.0
help build him solid

1738.32 --> 1742.8799999999999
so that he would not be mentally

1740.0 --> 1745.76
vulnerable anymore i really i i took

1742.88 --> 1747.5200000000002
good servant on as a project like that

1745.76 --> 1748.08
that's why i got really strict with him

1747.52 --> 1750.1589999999999
too

1748.08 --> 1752.559
because he would just freaking wander

1750.159 --> 1754.0800000000002
off in his mind so easily i had to be

1752.559 --> 1757.76
really brutal to him

1754.08 --> 1757.76
just to make him freaking listen

1757.84 --> 1764.8799999999999
like no stop it right now

1761.2 --> 1767.3600000000001
stop feeding your delusional thoughts

1764.88 --> 1770.3200000000002
get sensible right now i had to do that

1767.36 --> 1770.32
[ __ ] constantly

1772.799 --> 1776.08
and the young i just explained it the

1775.36 --> 1781.84
last half

1776.08 --> 1781.84
hour for [ __ ] sake girl

1787.56 --> 1790.69
[Music]

1792.84 --> 1795.84
right

1821.679 --> 1828.159
did he think you mean a good servant

1825.2 --> 1830.559
yes he was apparently convinced i am

1828.159 --> 1834.0800000000002
totally possessed by demons

1830.559 --> 1838.0
which is absolutely bizarre

1834.08 --> 1839.6789999999999
absolutely bizarre since the behavior

1838.0 --> 1843.12
doesn't show that

1839.679 --> 1845.76
like a demon could not survive acting

1843.12 --> 1846.8799999999999
in this fashion that's how you recognize

1845.76 --> 1850.24
a demon

1846.88 --> 1853.1200000000001
right because the demon is

1850.24 --> 1854.88
actually the misbehavior itself and then

1853.12 --> 1855.279
when the misbehavior is the only thing

1854.88 --> 1858.24
that's

1855.279 --> 1860.24
left then you know somebody's probably

1858.24 --> 1862.159
possessed by the demon because

1860.24 --> 1864.48
you don't recognize any more human

1862.159 --> 1865.8400000000001
behavior or wisdom or sensibility in

1864.48 --> 1868.48
them right

1865.84 --> 1869.519
so yeah good servant basically lost his

1868.48 --> 1872.3990000000001
mind he was

1869.519 --> 1873.2
indoctrinated by this tony frick who

1872.399 --> 1875.12
says yeah

1873.2 --> 1876.3990000000001
darwin is completely possessed by a

1875.12 --> 1879.36
demon he's

1876.399 --> 1880.08
he is trying a big project yeah yeah

1879.36 --> 1882.6399999999999
yeah

1880.08 --> 1883.4399999999998
did you know that you guys know that i

1882.64 --> 1885.76
actually am

1883.44 --> 1886.96
secretly the antichrist did you know

1885.76 --> 1888.799
that and i'm just

1886.96 --> 1890.72
building here building trust with

1888.799 --> 1892.799
everybody

1890.72 --> 1894.32
teaching the principles of the path of

1892.799 --> 1897.9189999999999
christ as i tell

1894.32 --> 1899.6
you know trying to help ascend people's

1897.919 --> 1900.3990000000001
consciousness defending them against

1899.6 --> 1902.48
darkness

1900.399 --> 1904.4799999999998
because that is what the antichrist

1902.48 --> 1906.3600000000001
would secretly do

1904.48 --> 1907.84
like he would fill that role

1906.36 --> 1910.1589999999999
specifically

1907.84 --> 1911.76
to help save the world so that they

1910.159 --> 1914.96
would all trust me

1911.76 --> 1916.399
and then it makes no [ __ ] sense

1914.96 --> 1920.3990000000001
whatsoever

1916.399 --> 1922.8799999999999
right none at all so

1920.399 --> 1924.6399999999999
i don't know what got into him but it's

1922.88 --> 1926.7990000000002
absolutely ridiculous

1924.64 --> 1929.279
it's absolutely ridiculous to think that

1926.799 --> 1932.84
i'm like some secret demon or something

1929.279 --> 1936.159
when i've done nothing but be absolutely

1932.84 --> 1938.24
blatantly blatantly honest

1936.159 --> 1940.96
about absolutely everything things that

1938.24 --> 1943.919
i should not have to be honest about

1940.96 --> 1945.039
because on average it's like damaging to

1943.919 --> 1947.2
be that honest

1945.039 --> 1949.6
in the public and i have done it

1947.2 --> 1952.32
nonetheless and i retain that

1949.6 --> 1953.039
i retain that position i am staying

1952.32 --> 1955.36
honest

1953.039 --> 1956.399
despite all these freaks out there doing

1955.36 --> 1959.279
these things

1956.399 --> 1960.559
i'm doing that right if you think that's

1959.279 --> 1962.32
demonic

1960.559 --> 1964.1589999999999
then you're delusional then you

1962.32 --> 1965.76
literally don't know what reality is

1964.159 --> 1969.44
anymore

1965.76 --> 1971.919
okay it's stupid it's really dumb

1969.44 --> 1972.72
it's embarrassing and i'm literally

1971.919 --> 1976.24
embarrassed

1972.72 --> 1978.08
for good servant for his attitude

1976.24 --> 1979.76
he should be ashamed of himself he

1978.08 --> 1982.96
should step away

1979.76 --> 1984.48
from the demon freak inquisitor wannabe

1982.96 --> 1987.6000000000001
guy

1984.48 --> 1990.559
get a grip back on his life

1987.6 --> 1993.12
get over this [ __ ] and then maybe we can

1990.559 --> 1995.9189999999999
talk again

1993.12 --> 1997.9189999999999
but yeah he absolutely broke our

1995.919 --> 2000.96
friendship and my trust

1997.919 --> 2002.72
and that's not something you meant very

2000.96 --> 2006.24
easily

2002.72 --> 2006.24
if ever so

2006.84 --> 2009.99
[Music]

2012.0 --> 2016.0
triple agent what what does that mean

2016.159 --> 2021.44
what a twist don't know what that means

2026.399 --> 2029.4399999999998
yeah good servant is literally on his

2028.96 --> 2032.159
side

2029.44 --> 2032.88
good servant supposedly good is now the

2032.159 --> 2036.48
slave

2032.88 --> 2040.64
of this disgusting viper demon

2036.48 --> 2044.84
openly miserably behaving viper demon

2040.64 --> 2046.0800000000002
it's shameful it's like literally like a

2044.84 --> 2048.96
jedi

2046.08 --> 2051.119
side right going and standing right next

2048.96 --> 2051.919
to the emperor when the emperor has just

2051.119 --> 2054.159
basically

2051.919 --> 2055.7599999999998
lightning tortured another person and

2054.159 --> 2057.04
then saying no no the emperor is the

2055.76 --> 2060.159
good guy

2057.04 --> 2061.2
that's what good servant basically has

2060.159 --> 2064.2400000000002
done

2061.2 --> 2067.4399999999996
so [ __ ] up it's unbelievable

2064.24 --> 2069.839
so tony is actually a demon

2067.44 --> 2070.879
well just you know them by their

2069.839 --> 2073.52
behavior

2070.879 --> 2074.56
and their actions so you be the judge of

2073.52 --> 2076.96
that

2074.56 --> 2078.879
to be fair i have not even watched or

2076.96 --> 2080.32
listened to anything he's done so far

2078.879 --> 2082.96
i've just gone

2080.32 --> 2084.56
from what other people reported on him

2082.96 --> 2086.32
to me

2084.56 --> 2089.839
like for example here we go again who

2086.32 --> 2089.839
actually engaged him

2090.8 --> 2095.9190000000003
right i'm just going by what other

2094.079 --> 2097.76
people have told me about him

2095.919 --> 2099.359
and what i saw about him in chat

2097.76 --> 2101.44
yesterday it was a

2099.359 --> 2102.7999999999997
yeah from what i got there is just a

2101.44 --> 2105.92
total savage

2102.8 --> 2108.48
miserable scumbag just like

2105.92 --> 2110.48
everybody's evil i'm here to prove to

2108.48 --> 2111.28
the world that this person is evil too

2110.48 --> 2114.56
because

2111.28 --> 2115.2000000000003
yeah yeah it's called just savonia

2114.56 --> 2118.24
syndrome

2115.2 --> 2119.2
classic cervane syndrome probably the

2118.24 --> 2122.64
worst

2119.2 --> 2126.7999999999997
case i've ever seen like this guy

2122.64 --> 2131.2
makes right the hand look like a

2126.8 --> 2134.32
a a level-headed clear mind soldier

2131.2 --> 2137.839
for real this guy is just the worst

2134.32 --> 2141.04
it's tony he's the worst right

2137.839 --> 2142.64
like i i take right to hand any day over

2141.04 --> 2144.4
this guy any day

2142.64 --> 2146.3199999999997
and right the hand will just out of

2144.4 --> 2149.6800000000003
nowhere start yelling at you

2146.32 --> 2152.96
out of paranoia right i take him

2149.68 --> 2155.5989999999997
over this guy any day of the week

2152.96 --> 2158.48
because he's that bad this guy is just

2155.599 --> 2163.2000000000003
[ __ ] up beyond repair it's no

2158.48 --> 2166.56
there's nothing to to salvage

2163.2 --> 2166.56
there's nothing left to salvage

2170.839 --> 2173.839
right

2181.68 --> 2185.68
and yeah i hope you don't take offense

2183.92 --> 2188.8
right to hand

2185.68 --> 2191.1189999999997
i know you might be listening maybe not

2188.8 --> 2191.119
you know

2196.56 --> 2202.72
okay yeah that's yeah that no

2200.24 --> 2203.4399999999996
no you're not gonna do that there's not

2202.72 --> 2205.839
gonna be

2203.44 --> 2207.04
tailor-made sock accounts for anything

2205.839 --> 2208.88
like that

2207.04 --> 2210.64
you might be the guy himself you might

2208.88 --> 2214.88
be somebody else

2210.64 --> 2218.0
no get out of here

2214.88 --> 2221.76
just be a person

2218.0 --> 2229.58
i don't need meme socks

2221.76 --> 2232.76
of anything just be a person

2229.58 --> 2232.7599999999998
[Music]

2233.44 --> 2237.28
and besides i don't think that tony

2235.28 --> 2240.079
stern has any gods

2237.28 --> 2240.96
i think he is a fanatical hardcore

2240.079 --> 2243.52
atheist

2240.96 --> 2244.32
and he just lies about everything he's

2243.52 --> 2247.359
basically just

2244.32 --> 2248.96
reenacting the bible only for power i

2247.359 --> 2252.0789999999997
don't think he believes in anything

2248.96 --> 2255.44
anything at all ever i think he's a

2252.079 --> 2258.8
hardcore fanatical atheist

2255.44 --> 2261.2000000000003
because that's what that turns into

2258.8 --> 2263.3590000000004
that behavior that way of doing things

2261.2 --> 2266.56
that level of nastiness

2263.359 --> 2268.88
that's a sign of fanatical atheism

2266.56 --> 2270.7999999999997
i don't know if that rings a belt with

2268.88 --> 2273.359
you guys

2270.8 --> 2275.04
but yeah you have that too fanatical

2273.359 --> 2279.2
atheists

2275.04 --> 2280.72
fanatical atheists are very nasty people

2279.2 --> 2282.16
there's nothing well there is something

2280.72 --> 2283.52
wrong but they're basically there are

2282.16 --> 2284.0
atheists out there not all of them are

2283.52 --> 2286.8
nasty

2284.0 --> 2287.359
but when they get really like fanatical

2286.8 --> 2290.5600000000004
about it

2287.359 --> 2291.68
those are like really creepy [ __ ] up

2290.56 --> 2294.88
people so

2291.68 --> 2297.04
yeah from the first glance

2294.88 --> 2298.32
i'd say he's a fanatical atheist and

2297.04 --> 2302.24
he's just lying about

2298.32 --> 2302.2400000000002
everything everything

2303.599 --> 2313.839
probably a pathological liar too

2319.44 --> 2323.76
i guess in a world of mandatory

2321.839 --> 2326.88
positivity

2323.76 --> 2329.5200000000004
some just mistake misunderstanding

2326.88 --> 2330.2400000000002
someone who accepts their full spectrum

2329.52 --> 2332.64
of being

2330.24 --> 2334.3199999999997
happy and angry as an evil entity oh i

2332.64 --> 2337.44
would not be surprised

2334.32 --> 2340.6400000000003
it's like what but you're not

2337.44 --> 2343.52
a pre-programmed computer that says

2340.64 --> 2344.16
everything that they think people want

2343.52 --> 2348.24
to hear

2344.16 --> 2351.44
well then you must be evil then right

2348.24 --> 2352.8799999999997
maybe people that don't have any soul

2351.44 --> 2355.92
that don't have any

2352.88 --> 2357.76
natural inherent morality

2355.92 --> 2359.6800000000003
given to them through their spirit by

2357.76 --> 2360.8
god because they all discarded that

2359.68 --> 2363.1189999999997
at some point in their life they

2360.8 --> 2364.96
literally threw god out into the garbage

2363.119 --> 2366.88
and their spirit with it

2364.96 --> 2368.64
yeah they'd probably see it like that

2366.88 --> 2370.96
it's also the the mind

2368.64 --> 2372.0789999999997
disease among a lot of social justice

2370.96 --> 2374.079
warriors

2372.079 --> 2375.92
because they no longer have any natural

2374.079 --> 2378.6400000000003
morality so they just go by the

2375.92 --> 2380.48
the code that was handed to them makes

2378.64 --> 2381.68
no freaking sense and it's completely

2380.48 --> 2384.48
unnatural

2381.68 --> 2384.48
so yeah sure

2390.24 --> 2393.7599999999998
yeah thanks dark steve84 i will don't

2392.8 --> 2397.04
worry about it

2393.76 --> 2399.5200000000004
i'm all right i feel really good i had a

2397.04 --> 2401.92
good night's rest yesterday i got all

2399.52 --> 2404.079
late and all that remember

2401.92 --> 2405.92
i had barely any sleep well this night i

2404.079 --> 2407.119
made sure like okay i'm going to bed at

2405.92 --> 2411.2000000000003
like two o'clock

2407.119 --> 2413.839
and i've slept

2411.2 --> 2414.48
ten and a half hours and it was very

2413.839 --> 2417.44
nice

2414.48 --> 2418.2400000000002
it was great i enjoyed that i feel good

2417.44 --> 2422.16
i feel

2418.24 --> 2424.4799999999996
rested i feel healthy and i feel calm

2422.16 --> 2439.839
i feel calm enough and that's good

2424.48 --> 2439.839
that's exactly what i wanted

2440.96 --> 2443.92
all right see you later

2446.48 --> 2450.8
all right so the show is still going to

2448.16 --> 2454.16
continue for another hour and 20 minutes

2450.8 --> 2456.0
for everybody who's still staying here

2454.16 --> 2457.5989999999997
and yeah even in the middle of it if you

2456.0 --> 2458.16
like the show please don't forget the

2457.599 --> 2461.44
rogan's

2458.16 --> 2463.68
up right

2461.44 --> 2464.88
because yeah votes get [ __ ] with and

2463.68 --> 2467.9199999999996
all that

2464.88 --> 2470.96
so it would be good yes

2467.92 --> 2471.2000000000003
i see i see it going up good so just do

2470.96 --> 2473.28
it

2471.2 --> 2475.4399999999996
already you know even if you like

2473.28 --> 2478.48
because you might leave in the middle

2475.44 --> 2481.04
and then forget about it

2478.48 --> 2482.319
so it's good to just vote it up if you

2481.04 --> 2484.8
if you're already kind of sure that

2482.319 --> 2487.44
you're gonna like it

2484.8 --> 2489.76
right also yeah yeah look at the title i

2487.44 --> 2490.56
i'm getting a lot of title inspiration

2489.76 --> 2492.96
these days

2490.56 --> 2494.16
it's like after the show's ended i'm

2492.96 --> 2496.2400000000002
thinking like wait wait

2494.16 --> 2499.5989999999997
what what am i gonna call the next show

2496.24 --> 2501.9199999999996
and i and yeah i think of these titles

2499.599 --> 2503.28
i like it i like that i got more titles

2501.92 --> 2504.0
and they're very fitting you know

2503.28 --> 2507.119
there's like

2504.0 --> 2509.68
generalized titles that

2507.119 --> 2511.2000000000003
fit rough situations and are always

2509.68 --> 2514.64
relevant

2511.2 --> 2519.52
so i like this one mistakes corrections

2514.64 --> 2519.52
lies and the wrecking ball very proud of

2520.839 --> 2526.72
that

2522.24 --> 2530.52
what youtube recommended me

2526.72 --> 2533.52
early bird show 135 has

2530.52 --> 2536.88
818 dislikes what

2533.52 --> 2539.52
that's bizarre that's really weird

2536.88 --> 2541.359
i don't care man look i i got some

2539.52 --> 2542.4
really bad moments too you know i got

2541.359 --> 2545.52
some moments where i

2542.4 --> 2546.7200000000003
got lost or i like felt really unhealthy

2545.52 --> 2549.7599999999998
or it's just like

2546.72 --> 2552.8799999999997
ragey for no good reason made really

2549.76 --> 2556.96
stupid remarks to people and yes

2552.88 --> 2560.319
those are in there those are in

2556.96 --> 2562.2400000000002
in my things i am not perfect i am not

2560.319 --> 2562.8
going to be perfect every single time

2562.24 --> 2565.9199999999996
although

2562.8 --> 2567.76
well maybe from now on i've reached this

2565.92 --> 2570.56
level where i can no longer

2567.76 --> 2572.88
go underneath a certain level it's just

2570.56 --> 2575.2
not possible anymore physiologically

2572.88 --> 2576.88
so there's no more terrible moments but

2575.2 --> 2579.9199999999996
yeah i've had some pretty

2576.88 --> 2582.1600000000003
embarrassing moments i'd say right

2579.92 --> 2582.96
and again it's just this there's this

2582.16 --> 2586.0789999999997
cult

2582.96 --> 2586.8
this anti-ararwin cult of people out

2586.079 --> 2590.079
there

2586.8 --> 2592.0
that are just obsessing over that like

2590.079 --> 2594.0
they're literally trying to take

2592.0 --> 2596.319
everything i've ever done

2594.0 --> 2598.079
take everything good that i've ever done

2596.319 --> 2599.119
out of it every piece of wisdom every

2598.079 --> 2603.119
good moment

2599.119 --> 2603.839
and just make a chain of really stupid

2603.119 --> 2607.92
freaky

2603.839 --> 2610.319
freak out moments of me and then imagine

2607.92 --> 2611.359
that is the real arwyn that's the only

2610.319 --> 2614.319
real arwyn

2611.359 --> 2616.0789999999997
nothing else about him exists it's only

2614.319 --> 2620.72
those bad moments and then they

2616.079 --> 2623.92
i guess worship that or something

2620.72 --> 2626.3999999999996
i don't know these people are freaks

2623.92 --> 2627.599
i feel like brian in the life of brian

2626.4 --> 2630.2400000000002
sometimes

2627.599 --> 2632.1600000000003
you know and there's this weirdos coming

2630.24 --> 2633.52
after me like yeah the sandal and the

2632.16 --> 2636.319
gourd and like dude

2633.52 --> 2636.96
leave me the [ __ ] alone you freaks this

2636.319 --> 2638.88
is

2636.96 --> 2640.319
that's what it feels like sometimes you

2638.88 --> 2642.079
know i'm just a guy

2640.319 --> 2644.0
walking around and all these weirdos

2642.079 --> 2645.92
coming after me thinking all of a sudden

2644.0 --> 2648.24
i'm the messiah because i said something

2645.92 --> 2650.64
sensible one time

2648.24 --> 2652.9599999999996
see what i mean is really what this

2650.64 --> 2656.0789999999997
feels like sometimes for me

2652.96 --> 2657.359
like why why are these people obsessed

2656.079 --> 2659.8390000000004
so much

2657.359 --> 2661.5989999999997
over a guy with not even 2 000

2659.839 --> 2664.7999999999997
subscribers on the internet

2661.599 --> 2668.4
why why

2664.8 --> 2671.599
what's the big deal i don't get it

2668.4 --> 2674.7200000000003
i'm just a guy here doing a show just

2671.599 --> 2677.76
being absolutely unrelentingly honest

2674.72 --> 2681.68
and straightforward right is that so

2677.76 --> 2682.079
so much trouble is your entire worldview

2681.68 --> 2685.52
that

2682.079 --> 2687.92
feeble that a random guy with less than

2685.52 --> 2691.359
2 000 subscribers on the internet

2687.92 --> 2693.839
cannot be tolerated to exist like what

2691.359 --> 2696.7999999999997
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

2693.839 --> 2697.2799999999997
seriously check into a with a mental

2696.8 --> 2699.3590000000004
health

2697.28 --> 2701.119
expert and tell him what you're doing

2699.359 --> 2703.2
and about me

2701.119 --> 2704.6400000000003
he will tell you you're probably gonna

2703.2 --> 2707.5989999999997
need some medication for that

2704.64 --> 2710.96
okay because it's really insane it's

2707.599 --> 2710.96
really freaking stupid

2711.28 --> 2716.6400000000003
you that is not me you you obsessing

2714.72 --> 2718.9599999999996
over some guy with less than 2 000

2716.64 --> 2722.48
subscribers on the internet

2718.96 --> 2732.41
that's really [ __ ] insane it is

2722.48 --> 2740.16
so yeah what the [ __ ]

2732.41 --> 2741.5989999999997
[Music]

2740.16 --> 2743.04
that's probably why so many people

2741.599 --> 2745.04
choose to make videos about me yeah yeah

2743.04 --> 2745.44
i'm all the thing i'm all the rage now

2745.04 --> 2748.72
again

2745.44 --> 2751.119
i guess the arwenian rage

2748.72 --> 2751.9199999999996
i got plenty of rage moments you know

2751.119 --> 2755.04
poof that

2751.92 --> 2755.52
that episode when when when i just got

2755.04 --> 2759.04
better

2755.52 --> 2761.28
yeah it was [ __ ] up i was so full of

2759.04 --> 2761.68
rage i like if it would have been more i

2761.28 --> 2763.92
would

2761.68 --> 2764.8799999999997
literally start foaming out of the mouth

2763.92 --> 2766.96
because i was just

2764.88 --> 2768.6400000000003
livid i was just out of my mind and

2766.96 --> 2771.76
literally like ah

2768.64 --> 2775.2
war war

2771.76 --> 2777.2000000000003
this is a berserk right

2775.2 --> 2778.3999999999996
it's honest though it's my honest

2777.2 --> 2780.16
feelings

2778.4 --> 2782.2400000000002
it was desperation also it was

2780.16 --> 2782.96
desperation driven and i can talk about

2782.24 --> 2786.319
that

2782.96 --> 2790.319
i'm not like oh i am now going to go

2786.319 --> 2792.64
on other people's shows to tell them

2790.319 --> 2794.24
that didn't really happen no no people

2792.64 --> 2797.5989999999997
are spreading these rumors

2794.24 --> 2799.2
about arwen having said certain things

2797.599 --> 2799.599
and being really pissed off it's all a

2799.2 --> 2802.0
lie

2799.599 --> 2804.079
you know i never did that no even though

2802.0 --> 2807.44
it's right there on my channel

2804.079 --> 2810.079
i didn't do that right so

2807.44 --> 2811.359
because i'm so afraid that people might

2810.079 --> 2813.04
actually see that

2811.359 --> 2815.2799999999997
and then think that that is the only

2813.04 --> 2816.24
thing that i am that i'll go on other

2815.28 --> 2819.599
people's shows

2816.24 --> 2821.68
and talk about how people saying

2819.599 --> 2823.92
that i got really angry and even said

2821.68 --> 2826.0
like i'll be your hitler and all that i

2823.92 --> 2827.359
said that's really silly really silly to

2826.0 --> 2828.96
say such a thing right

2827.359 --> 2831.7599999999998
now i'm gonna go around on other

2828.96 --> 2833.359
people's channels to basically tell them

2831.76 --> 2835.2000000000003
yeah yeah that didn't happen there's

2833.359 --> 2835.7599999999998
just people that they don't like me

2835.2 --> 2838.3999999999996
because

2835.76 --> 2838.8
i believe in gravity or something or i

2838.4 --> 2841.2000000000003
don't

2838.8 --> 2842.7200000000003
i believe in relative density right i'm

2841.2 --> 2845.5989999999997
just gonna tell everybody no no

2842.72 --> 2847.2
that's not real i i never said that it's

2845.599 --> 2848.1600000000003
just people they're just jealous and

2847.2 --> 2851.7599999999998
they're lying

2848.16 --> 2859.839
they disagree with my arguments so

2851.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
yeah that didn't happen

2860.48 --> 2867.28
you might be knowing right now

2863.52 --> 2869.04
or not knowing who i'm referring to

2867.28 --> 2870.7200000000003
because there is somebody out there

2869.04 --> 2874.72
that's actually doing that

2870.72 --> 2876.319
right now it's kind of weird

2874.72 --> 2878.0
and i think that everybody that knows

2876.319 --> 2880.96
that guy

2878.0 --> 2881.359
and they do also agrees that that is

2880.96 --> 2884.16
just

2881.359 --> 2884.16
really weird

2884.8 --> 2888.0
do you know who i speak of

2891.8 --> 2895.7690000000002
[Music]

2898.72 --> 2901.839
i knew you would

2912.0 --> 2915.68
that makes sense right you do something

2914.64 --> 2918.72
you say something

2915.68 --> 2919.68
you don't apologize you don't agree you

2918.72 --> 2922.72
don't address it

2919.68 --> 2925.7599999999998
and then you go on other shows to tell

2922.72 --> 2926.72
that other people are attacking you for

2925.76 --> 2929.76
something that

2926.72 --> 2932.0789999999997
you say you haven't said

2929.76 --> 2934.0
right because of your arguments they

2932.079 --> 2937.52
don't agree with

2934.0 --> 2940.0
even though you did actually say that

2937.52 --> 2942.079
it's still right there on your own

2940.0 --> 2944.24
channel for everybody to look into and

2942.079 --> 2946.0
listen and copy and download

2944.24 --> 2948.0789999999997
and you are going to go on other

2946.0 --> 2950.72
people's shows to tell them no that

2948.079 --> 2950.7200000000003
didn't happen

2952.72 --> 2957.839
sounds like somebody's got a very

2954.559 --> 2957.8390000000004
serious mental problem

2963.76 --> 2969.3590000000004
yeah the name starts with the b

2966.8 --> 2971.8390000000004
and it ends with a b i'll leave it to

2969.359 --> 2971.839
that

2990.559 --> 2994.96
right so anyway let's address the title

2993.2 --> 2997.5989999999997
for a moment

2994.96 --> 2998.4
because i did put it there for a reason

2997.599 --> 3000.88
mistakes

2998.4 --> 3003.92
corrections lies and the wrecking ball

3000.88 --> 3006.8
does anybody understand

3003.92 --> 3007.6800000000003
this title it's a it's a formula it's

3006.8 --> 3009.76
it's not just

3007.68 --> 3011.2799999999997
randomly put together things and it has

3009.76 --> 3014.8
a order

3011.28 --> 3015.92
as a or a chronological order do you see

3014.8 --> 3018.8
it

3015.92 --> 3018.8
you see what it means

3023.359 --> 3027.119
if you don't watch the news you are not

3025.52 --> 3030.64
informed if you watch it

3027.119 --> 3033.92
what's going on right

3030.64 --> 3033.92
i think it's back to normal

3036.16 --> 3043.68
the quality was getting orange

3039.76 --> 3043.6800000000003
not red yet orange

3047.44 --> 3050.8
even the chat disconnected

3050.96 --> 3055.599
it's still working though yeah okay okay

3053.2 --> 3057.359
i'm glad i spotted that in time

3055.599 --> 3060.0
like the youtube was basically getting

3057.359 --> 3061.44
stuck it's it's slow often but it was

3060.0 --> 3063.76
just really stuck but

3061.44 --> 3065.76
apparently my internet connection needed

3063.76 --> 3070.4
a quick refresh i saw it in time

3065.76 --> 3073.92
i'm back right

3070.4 --> 3075.119
where was i right yeah yeah the part

3073.92 --> 3078.2400000000002
about lies

3075.119 --> 3079.599
that every lie once you figure it out

3078.24 --> 3083.4399999999996
it's a lie

3079.599 --> 3084.3900000000003
has truth in it you understand

3083.44 --> 3086.8
how that works

3084.39 --> 3089.52
[Music]

3086.8 --> 3092.4
because nobody lies for no reason like

3089.52 --> 3096.24
even pathological liars

3092.4 --> 3099.52
don't lie for no reason

3096.24 --> 3101.5989999999997
pathological liars when not covering up

3099.52 --> 3104.48
some specific truth

3101.599 --> 3105.2000000000003
lie to fluster and confuse people to

3104.48 --> 3109.28
keep them

3105.2 --> 3112.0789999999997
off guard so they don't catch up

3109.28 --> 3114.1600000000003
mentally on the lies when the

3112.079 --> 3116.8
pathological liar is putting down a very

3114.16 --> 3118.24
serious lie that's really there to

3116.8 --> 3120.079
protect something specific

3118.24 --> 3122.319
that's why pathological liars lie

3120.079 --> 3124.8
constantly to throw people off

3122.319 --> 3126.24
so they don't get a grip on what is true

3124.8 --> 3129.44
and what is not

3126.24 --> 3132.5589999999997
see so every

3129.44 --> 3135.28
lie always has truth

3132.559 --> 3137.44
every single one of them and at that

3135.28 --> 3140.88
basically

3137.44 --> 3143.76
there is only truth all lies

3140.88 --> 3144.48
are always accompanied with truth

3143.76 --> 3149.3590000000004
because

3144.48 --> 3149.359
of that they are a lie you can only lie

3149.68 --> 3157.04
if you know what you say is incorrect

3154.0 --> 3157.599
you see because if you don't know if

3157.04 --> 3161.2799999999997
you're just

3157.599 --> 3163.52
guessing then you're making a mistake

3161.28 --> 3165.599
that's not a lie if you literally don't

3163.52 --> 3168.8
know if you don't have any

3165.599 --> 3169.92
idea with certainty you haven't figured

3168.8 --> 3172.0
it out

3169.92 --> 3173.44
but you say i think this i think this is

3172.0 --> 3174.96
true

3173.44 --> 3177.599
and after what it turns out not to be

3174.96 --> 3179.599
true then you're not lying

3177.599 --> 3181.119
that's called a mistake and people make

3179.599 --> 3184.48
a lot of mistakes

3181.119 --> 3187.76
right it's only when they

3184.48 --> 3190.0
don't correct that mistake

3187.76 --> 3191.76
and hold on to what they said even

3190.0 --> 3193.52
though afterward they found out it

3191.76 --> 3196.88
wasn't true

3193.52 --> 3200.16
that it becomes a lie

3196.88 --> 3204.1600000000003
you see that's the difference

3200.16 --> 3206.0789999999997
between a mistake and a lie

3204.16 --> 3208.0789999999997
a mistake everybody makes mistakes

3206.079 --> 3210.8
constantly right

3208.079 --> 3212.079
it's just that when they find out it was

3210.8 --> 3215.44
a mistake

3212.079 --> 3217.52
and they then don't correct that mistake

3215.44 --> 3218.88
then it becomes a lie if they keep on

3217.52 --> 3222.16
repeating it

3218.88 --> 3224.1600000000003
and pretending like it isn't

3222.16 --> 3225.359
a mistake that it's really true they

3224.16 --> 3227.839
double down on it

3225.359 --> 3228.7999999999997
on the mistake and then it becomes a lie

3227.839 --> 3231.2
because they know

3228.8 --> 3233.3590000000004
it's a lie now if they never really find

3231.2 --> 3233.68
out if it's true and they keep repeating

3233.359 --> 3235.2799999999997
it

3233.68 --> 3237.9199999999996
then they are just complete repeating

3235.28 --> 3240.1600000000003
the mistake and basically

3237.92 --> 3242.079
have a feeling like this might be a lie

3240.16 --> 3242.5589999999997
but i'm kind of i don't want to know i'm

3242.079 --> 3245.119
just i

3242.559 --> 3246.1600000000003
just want to tell this story see that's

3245.119 --> 3248.2400000000002
different

3246.16 --> 3249.359
that's kind of weird and in between it's

3248.24 --> 3251.2
still a mistake

3249.359 --> 3253.92
because they never confirmed to

3251.2 --> 3255.359
themselves that it's actually wrong

3253.92 --> 3257.119
it's only when they actually have

3255.359 --> 3258.7999999999997
confirmed to themselves that their

3257.119 --> 3261.92
assessment was wrong

3258.8 --> 3265.28
that it becomes a lie you see

3261.92 --> 3268.7200000000003
that's how it really works

3265.28 --> 3272.0
and if you hold on to lies

3268.72 --> 3273.2799999999997
then eventually the wrecking ball will

3272.0 --> 3276.48
come

3273.28 --> 3278.6400000000003
one way or the other because when you

3276.48 --> 3281.359
hold on to lies

3278.64 --> 3282.5589999999997
mistakes that you are that you know are

3281.359 --> 3284.799
incorrect

3282.559 --> 3286.0
and yet you conceal that information

3284.799 --> 3288.0
from others

3286.0 --> 3289.52
and repeat it then eventually people

3288.0 --> 3292.559
will find out

3289.52 --> 3294.64
they will confront you about the lies

3292.559 --> 3296.7200000000003
and then when they find out that you are

3294.64 --> 3300.24
indeed covering up those

3296.72 --> 3301.68
lies that you are actually lying about

3300.24 --> 3303.2799999999997
that it wasn't a mistake that needed

3301.68 --> 3304.839
correcting but that you are actually

3303.28 --> 3307.8390000000004
lying about it

3304.839 --> 3310.0789999999997
that's when the pressure from the

3307.839 --> 3313.359
outside starts building then you are

3310.079 --> 3316.4
becoming identified as a liar

3313.359 --> 3320.16
that's holding on to lies knowingly

3316.4 --> 3321.2000000000003
people will start to see that and then

3320.16 --> 3324.24
eventually that's

3321.2 --> 3327.4399999999996
all the people will see

3324.24 --> 3330.0789999999997
and then eventually god's wrecking ball

3327.44 --> 3331.44
will come and will swipe you off your

3330.079 --> 3333.44
feet

3331.44 --> 3335.119
crush everything you were trying to

3333.44 --> 3339.68
build and do

3335.119 --> 3343.599
because yeah nobody needs a liar

3339.68 --> 3346.5589999999997
nobody lying knowingly

3343.599 --> 3348.88
being incorrect and keeping that

3346.559 --> 3352.1600000000003
information from the outside world

3348.88 --> 3353.839
that's satan's domain very specifically

3352.16 --> 3357.359
satan's domain

3353.839 --> 3360.839
it's concealing the truth

3357.359 --> 3363.92
for real knowingly knowingly

3360.839 --> 3368.0
misleading that's lies

3363.92 --> 3372.799
that's satan's domain specifically

3368.0 --> 3375.52
the other side of the truth god's domain

3372.799 --> 3377.119
lies misinformation knowingly not

3375.52 --> 3379.599
mistakes mistakes are

3377.119 --> 3380.1600000000003
just mistakes they're human it's about

3379.599 --> 3383.44
what you

3380.16 --> 3385.68
learn about it when

3383.44 --> 3386.64
you then end up basically going either

3385.68 --> 3389.359
for the lies

3386.64 --> 3390.0
satan's domain or you correct it and you

3389.359 --> 3392.16
try to find

3390.0 --> 3394.799
the truth and then it's god's domain see

3392.16 --> 3394.799
how that works

3396.319 --> 3399.839
yeah i've heard about that zeptappy i

3397.92 --> 3401.6800000000003
don't really care he can do whatever he

3399.839 --> 3405.839
wants

3401.68 --> 3405.839
it's his life

3408.24 --> 3411.839
if he needs to team up with a baller

3410.079 --> 3414.079
then so be it you know

3411.839 --> 3415.68
do whatever the [ __ ] he wants he's

3414.079 --> 3416.96
already conceded that he doesn't really

3415.68 --> 3420.0789999999997
give a [ __ ]

3416.96 --> 3423.839
so he's just engaging

3420.079 --> 3425.119
who knows man maybe he just wants to be

3423.839 --> 3427.04
that friendly or

3425.119 --> 3429.52
flat earther among ballers or something

3427.04 --> 3431.92
eventually i don't know what it is

3429.52 --> 3432.64
i don't know what he wants he just wants

3431.92 --> 3434.96
whatever

3432.64 --> 3437.2
i don't care i don't follow him i don't

3434.96 --> 3441.28
particularly hate him

3437.2 --> 3441.2799999999997
right i just don't care anymore

3441.359 --> 3446.16
he's done some pretty repulsive things

3444.0 --> 3448.72
and he's betrayed our friendship

3446.16 --> 3450.24
not only mine also like sleeping

3448.72 --> 3453.0
warriors and all that

3450.24 --> 3456.0589999999997
and yeah i don't really care anymore

3453.0 --> 3456.059
[Music]

3457.28 --> 3460.559
first time a flat earther and a baller

3458.96 --> 3463.599
collaborate i wouldn't

3460.559 --> 3466.48
say that i think that that's not

3463.599 --> 3466.48
entirely correct

3466.96 --> 3470.48
i think he's the first edit but maybe

3469.76 --> 3474.7990000000004
the first

3470.48 --> 3478.0
more upfront channel to do that

3474.799 --> 3478.0
i think it's happened before

3486.839 --> 3492.7999999999997
anyway

3489.49 --> 3492.7999999999997
[Music]

3495.68 --> 3500.0
yeah it was it definitely was because he

3498.96 --> 3501.92
didn't just give it

3500.0 --> 3503.119
no he gave it to me and then he

3501.92 --> 3506.559
proceeded to

3503.119 --> 3510.7200000000003
whine about it on my channel for

3506.559 --> 3513.3590000000004
months for months he complained about

3510.72 --> 3514.8799999999997
how i am so unthankful blah blah blah

3513.359 --> 3518.16
how i didn't even think

3514.88 --> 3519.599
no no no he did not give it to me he

3518.16 --> 3522.319
gave it to me

3519.599 --> 3523.28
as a trap because he didn't give a [ __ ]

3522.319 --> 3525.52
he just wanted to

3523.28 --> 3526.96
[ __ ] all over me that's what randy

3525.52 --> 3528.319
wanted with that

3526.96 --> 3530.079
he didn't give a [ __ ] he was just

3528.319 --> 3531.44
whining complaining like oh i did

3530.079 --> 3534.2400000000002
something good and he's so

3531.44 --> 3534.96
thankful he did that for [ __ ] months

3534.24 --> 3537.2
dude

3534.96 --> 3538.4
so shut the [ __ ] up and get the [ __ ] out

3537.2 --> 3539.4399999999996
if you're gonna bring that up you're

3538.4 --> 3545.839
banned

3539.44 --> 3545.839
[ __ ] you

3551.28 --> 3554.6400000000003
for months you get it he complained

3554.0 --> 3556.4
about it

3554.64 --> 3557.7599999999998
for months you think that's just

3556.4 --> 3561.04
generous gift

3557.76 --> 3563.5200000000004
no no no that's giving somebody

3561.04 --> 3564.96
something just to be able to [ __ ] all

3563.52 --> 3567.28
over them

3564.96 --> 3567.28
right

3569.52 --> 3573.92
that's what that is and it's all on

3572.48 --> 3587.839
record

3573.92 --> 3587.839
everybody knows he did that

3592.48 --> 3601.839
right we're at the hour mark

3613.359 --> 3617.44
yeah that's right

3627.119 --> 3634.7200000000003
so right so i addressed the title

3632.0 --> 3636.799
is anybody still out there i want a

3634.72 --> 3637.1189999999997
conversation about something i kind of

3636.799 --> 3641.68
ran

3637.119 --> 3645.76
out of literal subjects to talk about

3641.68 --> 3649.44
hey cgi ranty a long time

3645.76 --> 3651.599
i see like cgi

3649.44 --> 3652.88
ranty is like one of the first sock

3651.599 --> 3655.599
trolls

3652.88 --> 3656.0
named after a another person that

3655.599 --> 3657.6800000000003
actually

3656.0 --> 3659.76
turned out to be a real person it's

3657.68 --> 3661.9199999999996
really weird this is

3659.76 --> 3664.3190000000004
so don't ban cgi ranty unless he's going

3661.92 --> 3668.319
to act like a total [ __ ] again

3664.319 --> 3670.4
right i have a random question

3668.319 --> 3672.64
shall i ask that depends on the nature

3670.4 --> 3684.4
of the random question but sure go ahead

3672.64 --> 3687.7599999999998
why not

3684.4 --> 3687.76
no i did not watch that

3688.16 --> 3692.3999999999996
yeah you understand i am not subscribed

3690.24 --> 3695.359
to ranty i don't watch his shows

3692.4 --> 3696.559
i don't i haven't watched anything ranty

3695.359 --> 3699.68
related in

3696.559 --> 3701.76
half a year i don't follow him at all i

3699.68 --> 3703.2799999999997
hear some things about people telling me

3701.76 --> 3706.0
that he did things in the background i

3703.28 --> 3706.0
don't watch him

3706.24 --> 3711.7599999999998
on josie's jose's oh well i definitely

3709.76 --> 3713.119
don't follow jose's it's a complete

3711.76 --> 3717.119
waste of time

3713.119 --> 3721.6800000000003
just a bunch of baller squirting all day

3717.119 --> 3721.6800000000003
terrible stuff so

3725.52 --> 3728.72
he's no branded clothes as slave

3727.839 --> 3731.2799999999997
insignia

3728.72 --> 3731.839
since we became consumer slaves yes it

3731.28 --> 3734.96
is

3731.839 --> 3734.96
it absolutely is

3736.319 --> 3743.44
it's also advertisement though

3739.52 --> 3746.64
but yeah since those brands

3743.44 --> 3749.839
are come with a big price tag

3746.64 --> 3750.64
usually yeah can say more slavish than

3749.839 --> 3753.2799999999997
that

3750.64 --> 3754.0
it's like oh i got this brand right oh

3753.28 --> 3756.559
yeah so you

3754.0 --> 3757.76
paid like double the what what that

3756.559 --> 3760.7200000000003
piece of cloth or whatever

3757.76 --> 3761.28
is worth just to show off with your

3760.72 --> 3765.359
brand

3761.28 --> 3767.039
yeah sounds like mind control slavery to

3765.359 --> 3769.0389999999998
me

3767.039 --> 3770.079
we should wear our own made clothes

3769.039 --> 3774.7990000000004
that's very

3770.079 --> 3774.799
noble of you uh

3775.92 --> 3779.039
i don't know about that

3779.2 --> 3785.52
i guess it would help

3783.68 --> 3787.5989999999997
synthetic materials i don't even know

3785.52 --> 3789.7599999999998
about that

3787.599 --> 3790.799
it's not not all synthetic materials are

3789.76 --> 3793.92
bad you know

3790.799 --> 3797.44
my pants have lasted for

3793.92 --> 3799.76
10 years like wearing them straight

3797.44 --> 3800.48
every day every day two pair two pair of

3799.76 --> 3803.8390000000004
pants

3800.48 --> 3806.079
for 10 years and they were

3803.839 --> 3807.7599999999998
partially made with synthetic materials

3806.079 --> 3809.3590000000004
they were made natural materials they

3807.76 --> 3810.4
would not have lasted that long by a

3809.359 --> 3812.5589999999997
long shot

3810.4 --> 3813.839
it would be destroyed after two years

3812.559 --> 3817.8390000000004
probably right

3813.839 --> 3819.2
so it's not don't over generalize i

3817.839 --> 3821.0389999999998
disagree

3819.2 --> 3822.72
it's really nice idea that you can make

3821.039 --> 3823.599
your own clothes and use all natural

3822.72 --> 3827.52
materials it's free

3823.599 --> 3830.88
very nice right and i agree

3827.52 --> 3833.0389999999998
don't just buy like consumerist and then

3830.88 --> 3836.079
throw it away after a year that's

3833.039 --> 3838.2400000000002
disgusting that's absolutely disgusting

3836.079 --> 3839.76
i'm a guy that buys something and then i

3838.24 --> 3842.64
wear it out until it

3839.76 --> 3843.5200000000004
literally disintegrates that's my

3842.64 --> 3846.4
strategy

3843.52 --> 3849.119
i like to wear things out to the max so

3846.4 --> 3849.92
that it absolutely utilized every aspect

3849.119 --> 3853.039
of it

3849.92 --> 3853.6800000000003
to the max and then create as little as

3853.039 --> 3856.4
waste

3853.68 --> 3858.799
as little waste as possible doing it

3856.4 --> 3858.799
like that

3859.52 --> 3864.16
that's how i do things and it doesn't

3862.079 --> 3866.2400000000002
mean like oh no synthetic materials like

3864.16 --> 3869.52
forbid synthetic materials absolutely

3866.24 --> 3871.9199999999996
not are you insane it's just don't

3869.52 --> 3875.2
buy plastic [ __ ] all the time and then

3871.92 --> 3878.079
throw it away again just don't do that

3875.2 --> 3880.48
stop it stop buying things and then

3878.079 --> 3883.119
throwing it away again don't do that

3880.48 --> 3884.64
if you're going to buy things do

3883.119 --> 3887.2000000000003
research about it

3884.64 --> 3889.5989999999997
know what you're buying know what it is

3887.2 --> 3892.96
know how long it lasts

3889.599 --> 3895.3590000000004
and then decide okay i'm buying this

3892.96 --> 3896.48
this is how long it's gonna last and

3895.359 --> 3898.88
that's it

3896.48 --> 3900.64
it's not like uh yeah this is cool this

3898.88 --> 3902.88
is cool oh i'm buying this oh

3900.64 --> 3904.48
and then like after a week oh i don't

3902.88 --> 3906.48
know why i bought this i think it's

3904.48 --> 3908.48
really ugly now i'm gonna throw it away

3906.48 --> 3911.92
if you do that you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3908.48 --> 3915.2
or a [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] right

3911.92 --> 3918.319
don't buy freaking new stuff if your

3915.2 --> 3921.359
clothes closet is full

3918.319 --> 3925.0389999999998
go [ __ ] yourself

3921.359 --> 3928.16
don't be wasteful but that doesn't mean

3925.039 --> 3928.7990000000004
no more plastic that's ridiculous this

3928.16 --> 3930.319
synthetic

3928.799 --> 3931.839
they're synthetic materials that are

3930.319 --> 3935.2
really awesome

3931.839 --> 3937.68
that are that like last forever

3935.2 --> 3940.8799999999997
seemingly why would you all throw that

3937.68 --> 3940.8799999999997
away that's stupid

3945.92 --> 3951.839
shop rags right

3953.119 --> 3958.079
okay that sounds nice michael jones

3956.4 --> 3960.1600000000003
great value super comfortable boots that

3958.079 --> 3961.44
sounds really interesting i got my own

3960.16 --> 3963.7599999999998
typical brand of

3961.44 --> 3964.7200000000003
boots that i'd like to get from the

3963.76 --> 3967.6800000000003
underground

3964.72 --> 3969.2799999999997
brands it's it's been around for a long

3967.68 --> 3972.0789999999997
time

3969.28 --> 3972.7200000000003
but yeah i do kind of need a new pair

3972.079 --> 3975.92
although they're

3972.72 --> 3978.9599999999996
looking pretty damn good for their age

3975.92 --> 3982.48
basically right so it's like

3978.96 --> 3985.839
steel nosed a lot of laces

3982.48 --> 3987.2
leather all leather with rubber soles

3985.839 --> 3988.88
and i love these things i've been

3987.2 --> 3992.799
wearing these types of food for

3988.88 --> 3994.48
20 years not the same pair by the way

3992.799 --> 3998.16
i've got many different

3994.48 --> 4001.2
re-bought it but i like those boots

3998.16 --> 4003.2799999999997
they're on average cost me like 80 euros

4001.2 --> 4004.48
for a pair which is kind of expensive

4003.28 --> 4008.079
but yeah they last

4004.48 --> 4009.28
really long and i like that and you can

4008.079 --> 4011.52
literally just go

4009.28 --> 4012.559
walk through the modern [ __ ] walk

4011.52 --> 4015.44
through water it'll

4012.559 --> 4015.44
work out great

4017.44 --> 4020.64
but i don't know maybe you found even

4018.96 --> 4022.88
better boots you know

4020.64 --> 4023.92
i'm willing to basically explore what

4022.88 --> 4026.48
else is out there

4023.92 --> 4026.96
i might change brands if it fits if it

4026.48 --> 4029.52
fits

4026.96 --> 4029.52
my image

4032.319 --> 4039.599
rose anvil reviews boots

4036.24 --> 4049.839
but is that male boots too because

4039.599 --> 4049.839
yeah it's just female shoes and all that

4051.44 --> 4056.0
belts kind of stopped me accidentally

4053.92 --> 4059.2000000000003
exposing myself

4056.0 --> 4063.839
okay tiny one well

4059.2 --> 4063.839
that's cute

4066.88 --> 4071.44
back boots sounds interesting

4073.359 --> 4076.48
michael jones i would really appreciate

4075.68 --> 4079.5989999999997
it if you like

4076.48 --> 4082.64
contacted me on skype sometimes because

4079.599 --> 4091.839
i do like to get some of these tips like

4082.64 --> 4091.839
i do like to check it out

4096.239 --> 4105.839
the arvin have you seen arvin ash

4106.719 --> 4110.96
the rv i don't like i didn't know that

4109.279 --> 4112.96
that's silly

4110.96 --> 4119.839
of course he's talking about space you

4112.96 --> 4119.839
know of course

4120.08 --> 4124.239
they probably erected like he probably

4122.96 --> 4126.4800000000005
picked that name was

4124.239 --> 4128.5599999999995
pushed to pick that name so that every

4126.48 --> 4131.199
time somebody hears arwin

4128.56 --> 4132.799
that they can find this arvin guy and

4131.199 --> 4133.44
then think oh wait it was just all the

4132.799 --> 4137.679
ruse

4133.44 --> 4139.759
you know that's really the tag it's all

4137.679 --> 4140.96
everything that's happening out there

4139.759 --> 4143.199
all these people these

4140.96 --> 4144.2390000000005
senseless directionless people that are

4143.199 --> 4147.599999999999
just doing

4144.239 --> 4150.239
stupid [ __ ]

4147.6 --> 4150.96
it's all building they're all building

4150.239 --> 4154.08
to just

4150.96 --> 4154.56
encapsulate anything that's real and

4154.08 --> 4157.6
then

4154.56 --> 4159.679
replace it replace make somebody else

4157.6 --> 4160.88
with very similar names so that people

4159.679 --> 4163.679
can

4160.88 --> 4164.64
very easily mistake those people for the

4163.679 --> 4168.159
real thing

4164.64 --> 4169.92
and then evade contact that's what they

4168.159 --> 4171.12
like to do out there that's what youtube

4169.92 --> 4173.6
with google

4171.12 --> 4174.48
what they like to do is literally

4173.6 --> 4177.04
replace

4174.48 --> 4177.839
everything that is real with something

4177.04 --> 4181.5199999999995
that just

4177.839 --> 4184.96
mimics that so that people will mistake

4181.52 --> 4186.56
the mimic for the actual thing

4184.96 --> 4188.08
that's what they want that's what they

4186.56 --> 4190.64
really really

4188.08 --> 4191.2789999999995
desperately want that's why all these

4190.64 --> 4193.679
[ __ ]

4191.279 --> 4194.96
fake flat earthers that are absolute

4193.679 --> 4198.08
retards that don't know

4194.96 --> 4200.719
anything pop up everywhere and

4198.08 --> 4202.08
and spam this [ __ ] like these are the

4200.719 --> 4204.08
artists and then like oh they get

4202.08 --> 4206.719
invited on the baller show oh

4204.08 --> 4208.64
and they're retards surprise surprise it

4206.719 --> 4210.08
doesn't seem like controlled opposition

4208.64 --> 4213.280000000001
at all

4210.08 --> 4215.04
yeah well google and youtube love those

4213.28 --> 4217.759999999999
[ __ ] retards i bet they get

4215.04 --> 4218.08
big big ass paychecks just to seem like

4217.76 --> 4220.400000000001
an

4218.08 --> 4221.679
absolute [ __ ] [ __ ] they could

4220.4 --> 4224.879999999999
probably get big

4221.679 --> 4226.96
paychecks to act like they're really

4224.88 --> 4230.0
[ __ ] stupid

4226.96 --> 4232.96
as flat earthers you understand

4230.0 --> 4235.12
they get paid to act like being [ __ ]

4232.96 --> 4237.04
retards and flat earthers

4235.12 --> 4238.239
i'm pretty sure they are because there

4237.04 --> 4241.12
are multiple

4238.239 --> 4243.5199999999995
of these people out there that join

4241.12 --> 4246.88
these supposed baller channels

4243.52 --> 4249.1990000000005
to have a debate and show once and for

4246.88 --> 4251.28
all that flatters doesn't have any

4249.199 --> 4252.239
arguments and of course the earth is a

4251.28 --> 4255.599999999999
ball

4252.239 --> 4257.5199999999995
right because there's a big big

4255.6 --> 4258.8
market for that because of the

4257.52 --> 4260.719
desperation

4258.8 --> 4261.84
of people that have actually went to

4260.719 --> 4264.08
real flat earthers

4261.84 --> 4265.4400000000005
and then one shocked the [ __ ] out of

4264.08 --> 4268.48
their ass

4265.44 --> 4270.239
like what the [ __ ] is this this can't be

4268.48 --> 4273.5199999999995
real

4270.239 --> 4276.0
how do they know these things

4273.52 --> 4278.0
how do they remind me of things i've

4276.0 --> 4280.08
learned in school and forgotten

4278.0 --> 4281.44
how can this be this can be this can be

4280.08 --> 4284.64
real shocking

4281.44 --> 4288.0
shocking so let's find the

4284.64 --> 4288.719
actual flat earthers on the baller

4288.0 --> 4291.44
channels

4288.719 --> 4292.32
with really [ __ ] dumb arguments and

4291.44 --> 4295.839999999999
then it's like

4292.32 --> 4297.5199999999995
oh thank god thank god oh i thought that

4295.84 --> 4298.719
flat earth has really had an argument

4297.52 --> 4300.88
sometime you know

4298.719 --> 4302.88
that that the earth was not a ball after

4300.88 --> 4304.32
all well it turns out that there's

4302.88 --> 4306.159000000001
all these flat earths out there and they

4304.32 --> 4307.759999999999
really are stupid they are really dumb

4306.159 --> 4308.719
they might say really stupid things so

4307.76 --> 4310.8
it's all right

4308.719 --> 4312.2390000000005
i could just go back to what i was doing

4310.8 --> 4314.08
don't have to worry about

4312.239 --> 4315.678999999999
that maybe the earth is not a ball after

4314.08 --> 4317.28
all because the flat earthers are stupid

4315.679 --> 4318.88
like all the abolishers saying because

4317.28 --> 4321.04
look at all these flat earthers that are

4318.88 --> 4324.159000000001
just really really dumb

4321.04 --> 4327.36
right right yeah

4324.159 --> 4330.08
so there's a big market for fake

4327.36 --> 4331.599999999999
flat earthers that specifically act like

4330.08 --> 4333.84
flat earthers that are really dumb

4331.6 --> 4337.92
there's a really big market for that

4333.84 --> 4339.28
because ballers especially the religious

4337.92 --> 4342.64
fanatical ones

4339.28 --> 4346.159
are really desperate

4342.64 --> 4348.96
to deadly levels at this point

4346.159 --> 4349.679
facing us every single time not having a

4348.96 --> 4352.4800000000005
single

4349.679 --> 4353.4400000000005
splinter of an argument left nowhere

4352.48 --> 4356.08
left to go

4353.44 --> 4356.5599999999995
they're lost they've lost everything and

4356.08 --> 4358.48
they're

4356.56 --> 4360.400000000001
never getting it back the only way they

4358.48 --> 4363.04
can think they are getting it back

4360.4 --> 4364.08
is through lies through forgetting what

4363.04 --> 4368.239
is real

4364.08 --> 4371.199
again and again and again and then yeah

4368.239 --> 4371.599999999999
a couple of people that are acting like

4371.199 --> 4374.32
they're

4371.6 --> 4375.1990000000005
the real flat earthers and are absolute

4374.32 --> 4378.4
retards that

4375.199 --> 4381.12
can't even coherently speak a sentence

4378.4 --> 4382.879999999999
right yeah those people are very welcome

4381.12 --> 4384.88
because then they

4382.88 --> 4385.92
help those people that just want to

4384.88 --> 4388.56
forget

4385.92 --> 4390.08
they help them reinforce the image like

4388.56 --> 4391.84
wait wait wait no it was an illusion

4390.08 --> 4393.28
that those weren't real flat earth this

4391.84 --> 4395.04
is that's that didn't happen

4393.28 --> 4396.8
because here's the real flat earth yeah

4395.04 --> 4397.5199999999995
they are stupid just like the baller

4396.8 --> 4398.88
said

4397.52 --> 4400.88
it's all right it's all right because

4398.88 --> 4402.88
the flat earthers are all stupid

4400.88 --> 4404.159000000001
i can go back to my business and forget

4402.88 --> 4413.84
about this

4404.159 --> 4413.839999999999
yeah that's what it is

4430.32 --> 4433.92
black tony for hate speech dude who are

4432.88 --> 4437.84
you and why

4433.92 --> 4437.84
are you sucking this [ __ ]

4438.0 --> 4441.84
i don't like that

4443.199 --> 4446.879999999999
and my advice for this tony is don't

4445.6 --> 4450.0
give him any energy

4446.88 --> 4451.679
just ignore him at this point

4450.0 --> 4453.6
now if you see something he's slandering

4451.679 --> 4454.56
somebody specific yeah sure go in there

4453.6 --> 4456.96
and

4454.56 --> 4460.56
rebut it but you got to realize that

4456.96 --> 4462.719
this guy is complete mental patient

4460.56 --> 4464.64
and he is going to on average be ignored

4462.719 --> 4467.199
for being an absolute [ __ ]

4464.64 --> 4467.84
mental patient freak no matter what no

4467.199 --> 4469.36
matter what

4467.84 --> 4470.96
even if he's going after flutter it's

4469.36 --> 4471.92
going to be ignored because he is a

4470.96 --> 4474.32
freak

4471.92 --> 4476.0
has no sensibility to him whatsoever and

4474.32 --> 4478.48
he's disgusting

4476.0 --> 4480.32
everything he says is disgusting so if

4478.48 --> 4483.12
you could you could flag him for hate

4480.32 --> 4485.92
speech it's just useless

4483.12 --> 4485.92
who gives a [ __ ]

4494.84 --> 4499.84
right

4497.12 --> 4499.84
it's useless

4502.4 --> 4505.5199999999995
he is useless he's completely useless

4504.88 --> 4509.1990000000005
and

4505.52 --> 4512.88
it's basically a ponzi scheme

4509.199 --> 4514.96
of him to make people believe

4512.88 --> 4516.159000000001
that he's not completely useless that's

4514.96 --> 4518.719
the ponzi scheme

4516.159 --> 4520.48
the ponzi scheme is the spiritual

4518.719 --> 4522.84
investment that he demands with his

4520.48 --> 4526.159
intensity and his

4522.84 --> 4527.28
veracity that he's really going after

4526.159 --> 4529.679
these people that he's

4527.28 --> 4531.5199999999995
really gonna do something about it

4529.679 --> 4533.679
that's the ponzi scheme

4531.52 --> 4535.76
so every little piece of weight you're

4533.679 --> 4536.4
gonna give him to him any sort of credit

4535.76 --> 4539.679
or

4536.4 --> 4541.92
potential danger is just going to play

4539.679 --> 4542.96
into that spiritual ponzi scheme you

4541.92 --> 4547.1990000000005
understand

4542.96 --> 4550.84
because he's gonna do nothing absolutely

4547.199 --> 4553.36
nothing totally nothing not a single

4550.84 --> 4554.64
individual their lives will truly be

4553.36 --> 4557.36
altered because of him

4554.64 --> 4558.719
ever it's never gonna have any police

4557.36 --> 4562.0
arrive at any door

4558.719 --> 4564.84
ever it's absolutely preposterous the

4562.0 --> 4568.8
guy is a total scam artist

4564.84 --> 4570.4800000000005
total natural scam artist

4568.8 --> 4572.08
because he might even believe that he's

4570.48 --> 4575.36
going to do that i know

4572.08 --> 4577.92
he will not i know it i know it

4575.36 --> 4578.639999999999
i would literally bet money on that he's

4577.92 --> 4580.88
going to do

4578.64 --> 4582.8
absolutely nothing not even with people

4580.88 --> 4584.64
that might halfway deserve it

4582.8 --> 4585.84
right because there's some [ __ ] up

4584.64 --> 4588.88
people he went after

4585.84 --> 4592.2390000000005
too he's not gonna do anything

4588.88 --> 4596.2390000000005
nothing nothing

4592.239 --> 4596.879999999999
not a thing he's only gonna whine about

4596.239 --> 4599.28
it

4596.88 --> 4601.1990000000005
why don't why not why no wine and wine

4599.28 --> 4604.639999999999
and wine no why no wine

4601.199 --> 4607.28
that's the only thing he's going to do

4604.64 --> 4608.96
no nothing else no physical action no

4607.28 --> 4611.44
consequences

4608.96 --> 4611.44
nothing

4612.239 --> 4616.48
and i would bet money on that fact

4614.96 --> 4619.36
because it doesn't matter

4616.48 --> 4619.919999999999
years after years nothing not a thing he

4619.36 --> 4624.0
will do

4619.92 --> 4629.04
nothing nothing but blabber on endlessly

4624.0 --> 4629.04
with his misery and his disgusting

4634.84 --> 4637.84
delusion

4648.88 --> 4652.400000000001
yeah right michael jones it's kind of

4650.4 --> 4655.759999999999
weird isn't it they're just the thought

4652.4 --> 4655.759999999999
of it's kind of ridiculous

4655.84 --> 4661.6
like like architecture just come

4659.04 --> 4662.239
becomes completely impossible on a ball

4661.6 --> 4665.04
it

4662.239 --> 4665.44
is just i don't even want to explain why

4665.04 --> 4667.679
it's

4665.44 --> 4669.36
just blatantly obvious it just becomes

4667.679 --> 4671.76
absolutely impossible

4669.36 --> 4672.88
you know you know that circle-centric

4671.76 --> 4676.159000000001
design is like

4672.88 --> 4676.56
really difficult even if it's just one

4676.159 --> 4680.4
dime

4676.56 --> 4682.96
in one dimension like designing a

4680.4 --> 4684.4
building completely around a single

4682.96 --> 4687.12
point in a circular fashion

4684.4 --> 4689.199
is really difficult architectural wise

4687.12 --> 4690.64
it is

4689.199 --> 4693.12
that's why most buildings are just

4690.64 --> 4696.400000000001
squared they're all boxes

4693.12 --> 4698.32
squared because that's easier right

4696.4 --> 4699.44
well just imagine that the very

4698.32 --> 4702.0
foundation on which

4699.44 --> 4702.5599999999995
all things are built would be spherical

4702.0 --> 4704.719
it's

4702.56 --> 4706.719
it's impossible it's just not nobody

4704.719 --> 4709.679
could do that [ __ ]

4706.719 --> 4711.28
nobody would want to they'd just give up

4709.679 --> 4712.0
at some point because it's still [ __ ]

4711.28 --> 4721.84
difficult

4712.0 --> 4721.84
everything would always crumble

4726.159 --> 4731.5199999999995
you can't build anything on a ball

4729.36 --> 4735.839999999999
have you tried have you tried building

4731.52 --> 4735.84
anything on a ball yet

4741.92 --> 4749.84
oh god my hair is extra fluffy today

4756.719 --> 4760.8
yeah yeah spinning glow i know yeah

4759.36 --> 4762.159
building on a spinning gloves more

4760.8 --> 4766.08
difficulty but it's

4762.159 --> 4766.639999999999
yeah anyway the earth is definitely flat

4766.08 --> 4770.48
guys

4766.64 --> 4771.52
it's absolutely flat oh and there we go

4770.48 --> 4774.48
again the triggers

4771.52 --> 4774.4800000000005
oh the triggers

4775.28 --> 4778.32
because i when do i even say that

4777.28 --> 4779.92
anymore you know

4778.32 --> 4783.36
the title of the show but i don't even

4779.92 --> 4785.1990000000005
have to say it anymore it's just that

4783.36 --> 4786.5599999999995
i know it's still people out there that

4785.199 --> 4788.639999999999
just wait and it just like

4786.56 --> 4790.88
in their mind they're like when is he

4788.64 --> 4792.4800000000005
gonna change that flat earth

4790.88 --> 4795.04
in the title of flat earth early bird

4792.48 --> 4796.5599999999995
show because that was just an entry

4795.04 --> 4798.96
right that that was just

4796.56 --> 4801.04
kind of a scam to get attention to them

4798.96 --> 4803.36
that's what they really think

4801.04 --> 4805.28
and arwyn is not actually here to talk

4803.36 --> 4807.599999999999
about flat earth because of course he

4805.28 --> 4809.599999999999
knows the earth is a globe so it just

4807.6 --> 4811.52
did that for attention

4809.6 --> 4813.120000000001
and yeah he doesn't barely talk about

4811.52 --> 4816.159000000001
flat earth anymore

4813.12 --> 4818.159
because yeah nobody wants to hear those

4816.159 --> 4821.759999999999
lies of course right

4818.159 --> 4825.36
so yeah the earth is [ __ ] flat [ __ ]

4821.76 --> 4826.56
the earth is flat it's flat there's no

4825.36 --> 4830.96
curvature there is

4826.56 --> 4832.88
no non-flat geometrical aspect

4830.96 --> 4834.4
to the surface of the earth it's all

4832.88 --> 4837.6
flat it's not concave

4834.4 --> 4841.28
it's not a sphere it's flat

4837.6 --> 4845.280000000001
flat flat

4841.28 --> 4848.8
flat it's all flat

4845.28 --> 4850.96
yeah it is absolutely

4848.8 --> 4852.2390000000005
there's nothing you can do about it ever

4850.96 --> 4855.44
it is the fact

4852.239 --> 4858.5599999999995
of reality the physical measurable

4855.44 --> 4859.36
confirmed reality that you don't want to

4858.56 --> 4862.719
know

4859.36 --> 4864.159
it is true though right so yeah it's

4862.719 --> 4867.6
your life challenge i guess

4864.159 --> 4868.0
to overcome that lie that you don't want

4867.6 --> 4870.159000000001
to

4868.0 --> 4872.4
learn about you don't want it to be a

4870.159 --> 4874.08
lie you just want to keep it as a

4872.4 --> 4874.5599999999995
mistake and then never find out the

4874.08 --> 4877.28
truth

4874.56 --> 4878.2390000000005
well guess what enough confrontation and

4877.28 --> 4881.5199999999995
it will be

4878.239 --> 4885.04
your lie and then will you defend

4881.52 --> 4888.719
that lie the rest of your life

4885.04 --> 4891.12
lie to other people about it will you

4888.719 --> 4892.08
will you become a liar will the lie

4891.12 --> 4895.12
become you

4892.08 --> 4896.239
will you turn into a baller zealot and

4895.12 --> 4898.96
just spout

4896.239 --> 4901.04
garbage religious fanatical garbage the

4898.96 --> 4902.639
rest of your life to other people offend

4901.04 --> 4904.4
people hurt people

4902.639 --> 4905.92
because they dare question your

4904.4 --> 4909.679
religious conviction

4905.92 --> 4912.96
will you or will you just get the [ __ ]

4909.679 --> 4913.84
over it and realize wait yeah all that

4912.96 --> 4916.4
[ __ ]

4913.84 --> 4917.679
it's all [ __ ] literally [ __ ] is

4916.4 --> 4922.239
[ __ ]

4917.679 --> 4924.4800000000005
it's all ball it's all fake all lies

4922.239 --> 4926.48
right and hey doesn't mean that cool

4924.48 --> 4927.44
science fiction series and movies can be

4926.48 --> 4929.599999999999
enjoyed you know

4927.44 --> 4931.678999999999
i don't mind like watching a spaceship

4929.6 --> 4933.679
going like

4931.679 --> 4936.4
and we're going to another planet and go

4933.679 --> 4940.159
to warp speed

4936.4 --> 4941.199
i love that [ __ ] i love it it's just not

4940.159 --> 4944.5599999999995
real

4941.199 --> 4946.4
you see if you can overcome that you can

4944.56 --> 4949.92
absolutely enjoy

4946.4 --> 4951.679
the ball cosmology in science fiction in

4949.92 --> 4953.4400000000005
fantasy it's lovely it's cool it's

4951.679 --> 4954.4
pretty awesome it's fascinating it's

4953.44 --> 4958.0
interesting

4954.4 --> 4961.92
i like it it's just

4958.0 --> 4961.92
not real

4962.639 --> 4970.0
that's why it's called science fiction

4966.8 --> 4972.96
not because oh look at what the people

4970.0 --> 4973.36
conjured up that in the future will be

4972.96 --> 4977.28
real

4973.36 --> 4980.719
no no it's science fiction

4977.28 --> 4983.759999999999
it's fiction of

4980.719 --> 4987.12
based on science it's

4983.76 --> 4989.360000000001
the science is fiction you see

4987.12 --> 4990.4
that's why it's the genre science

4989.36 --> 4993.44
fiction

4990.4 --> 4995.599999999999
oh you didn't think it meant that

4993.44 --> 4997.36
did you oh it's something different well

4995.6 --> 4999.6
guess what you convoluted

4997.36 --> 5000.88
the meaning for yourself because you

4999.6 --> 5004.88
didn't want to realize

5000.88 --> 5008.159000000001
that it is science fiction

5004.88 --> 5011.6
get it right because the earth is

5008.159 --> 5012.4
flat and all that science fiction idea

5011.6 --> 5014.8
of the ball

5012.4 --> 5018.96
and going in a spaceship away from the

5014.8 --> 5021.360000000001
ball and warp speed to the other galaxy

5018.96 --> 5023.199
never going to happen ever because it's

5021.36 --> 5026.159
physically impossible

5023.199 --> 5027.678999999999
there is no outer space there is no

5026.159 --> 5031.199
infinite room

5027.679 --> 5032.4
of a vacuum with where you can go with a

5031.199 --> 5035.759999999999
vessel

5032.4 --> 5037.5199999999995
to explore that does not exist not in

5035.76 --> 5041.1990000000005
the real world

5037.52 --> 5044.719
in the spiritual realm perhaps there are

5041.199 --> 5045.44
mysteries yet to be unraveled for every

5044.719 --> 5047.84
individual

5045.44 --> 5049.599999999999
potentially right there's in the

5047.84 --> 5053.52
physical reality however

5049.6 --> 5056.639
that does not exist never did exist

5053.52 --> 5060.159000000001
and never will exist and you gotta

5056.639 --> 5063.76
get over that fact fact

5060.159 --> 5064.5599999999995
it's a fact never existed it never will

5063.76 --> 5068.4800000000005
exist

5064.56 --> 5068.4800000000005
only exists in your mind

5069.679 --> 5075.6
learn to distinguish physical reality

5072.88 --> 5076.4800000000005
from science fiction and you'll have a

5075.6 --> 5078.88
great life

5076.48 --> 5080.5599999999995
you will be able to deal with that and

5078.88 --> 5082.32
you can even still talk

5080.56 --> 5084.0
through science fiction about these

5082.32 --> 5086.0
conceptions like

5084.0 --> 5088.239
warp speed what is the warp speed how

5086.0 --> 5090.159
does that work the bending of space time

5088.239 --> 5091.839999999999
how could it mechanically unfold how

5090.159 --> 5094.638999999999
could that technically work

5091.84 --> 5096.639
i love to discuss that [ __ ] i like it i

5094.639 --> 5097.28
like the idea how that would work and

5096.639 --> 5099.92
like

5097.28 --> 5101.28
oh we're going to like different type of

5099.92 --> 5102.56
work we're going to go to like a

5101.28 --> 5105.28
subspace warp

5102.56 --> 5107.76
where we're going to control a wormhole

5105.28 --> 5111.28
and then stretch the time itself

5107.76 --> 5113.4400000000005
so that you can go even faster without

5111.28 --> 5115.04
like the resignation of the speed

5113.44 --> 5117.04
tearing the whole ship apart and then

5115.04 --> 5120.88
you have stability fields

5117.04 --> 5122.96
to actually even enforce that i love the

5120.88 --> 5124.719
i love that [ __ ] it's science fiction i

5122.96 --> 5126.32
love science fiction technology

5124.719 --> 5128.96
mechanics i love it

5126.32 --> 5131.12
i i want to build a science fiction

5128.96 --> 5133.28
technology future game

5131.12 --> 5134.48
i want to build one of that i even did

5133.28 --> 5136.239
that back then

5134.48 --> 5137.599999999999
when i still thought it was real i loved

5136.239 --> 5141.759999999999
that i love

5137.6 --> 5145.04
science fiction technology thinking

5141.76 --> 5148.08
but i also know it's

5145.04 --> 5151.199
not real

5148.08 --> 5154.239
it's not real

5151.199 --> 5158.159
it never will be

5154.239 --> 5161.199
real and that's okay because

5158.159 --> 5161.599999999999
yeah there's a lot of things that we

5161.199 --> 5164.159
love

5161.6 --> 5165.6
and cherish that are not real and that

5164.159 --> 5168.32
we know aren't real

5165.6 --> 5169.04
we know lord of the rings is never

5168.32 --> 5171.36
literal

5169.04 --> 5172.56
it's symbolic it's it has truth in it it

5171.36 --> 5174.96
has a lot of

5172.56 --> 5176.56
spiritual truth in it it's a very great

5174.96 --> 5180.719
story i loved it i was

5176.56 --> 5185.120000000001
named after this book our win

5180.719 --> 5186.4
based on are when a name of a half elf

5185.12 --> 5189.04
it's elven it has an

5186.4 --> 5189.839999999999
elven meaning yeah i love lord of the

5189.04 --> 5191.84
rings

5189.84 --> 5194.8
but i'm not going to pretend like that

5191.84 --> 5195.52
is the physical reality or was the

5194.8 --> 5198.56
absolute

5195.52 --> 5201.52
physical reality at any point

5198.56 --> 5204.080000000001
i might imagine at some point like maybe

5201.52 --> 5206.400000000001
a hundred thousand years ago that was

5204.08 --> 5209.12
literally there

5206.4 --> 5212.239
there's no way to falsify that so it's

5209.12 --> 5215.04
completely useless to contemplate this

5212.239 --> 5216.5599999999995
right but we will still take these

5215.04 --> 5219.199
fiction stories

5216.56 --> 5221.679
and we can cherish them and we can live

5219.199 --> 5224.32
in that imaginary world in our minds we

5221.679 --> 5226.639
can project it and think like yeah

5224.32 --> 5227.679
that's there and this person that's how

5226.639 --> 5230.719
they act and

5227.679 --> 5233.84
it's very inspiring right it's not

5230.719 --> 5234.4800000000005
physical reality though we can live with

5233.84 --> 5237.52
this

5234.48 --> 5238.638999999999
it's just important that you know what

5237.52 --> 5241.360000000001
is real

5238.639 --> 5244.0
in the physical world and what is in our

5241.36 --> 5247.12
imagination which is real to us

5244.0 --> 5248.4
it's just not physical reality it's very

5247.12 --> 5251.679
important

5248.4 --> 5255.28
to have this distinguishment

5251.679 --> 5258.4
you know it's the border between sanity

5255.28 --> 5262.88
and psychosis because if you can't

5258.4 --> 5266.32
distinguish fantasy from reality

5262.88 --> 5268.96
then you are clinically

5266.32 --> 5269.599999999999
in a psychosis that is what psychosis is

5268.96 --> 5271.84
it's the

5269.6 --> 5273.6
inability you lose the ability to

5271.84 --> 5276.639
distinguish

5273.6 --> 5279.360000000001
fantasy something that you imagine from

5276.639 --> 5280.0
the physical things out there brought to

5279.36 --> 5282.08
you by your

5280.0 --> 5283.6
sensories that is what clinical

5282.08 --> 5286.159
psychosis is

5283.6 --> 5287.04
do you understand this is not something

5286.159 --> 5290.96
i just made up

5287.04 --> 5293.04
this is absolutely real confirmed any

5290.96 --> 5295.28
psychology will tell you that i'm right

5293.04 --> 5297.199
about what i just said that last

5295.28 --> 5298.239
sentence about what psychosis is that is

5297.199 --> 5301.36
what it is

5298.239 --> 5304.5599999999995
that's why it's very important to learn

5301.36 --> 5305.599999999999
what is physically real and what is

5304.56 --> 5307.92
fantasy

5305.6 --> 5309.1990000000005
and not mix them up because it's very

5307.92 --> 5312.4
unhealthy

5309.199 --> 5315.199
when the borders start to become fuzzy

5312.4 --> 5317.679
it's very unhealthy for your psyche for

5315.199 --> 5321.199
your consciousness for your soul

5317.679 --> 5323.12
to not be able to distinguish reality

5321.199 --> 5324.239
from fiction all that well it's

5323.12 --> 5327.679
unhealthy

5324.239 --> 5331.678999999999
probably so proven statistically

5327.679 --> 5335.04
studies studies have been made right

5331.679 --> 5337.84
it's very important to know

5335.04 --> 5337.84
the difference

5338.73 --> 5341.79
[Music]

5343.44 --> 5346.638999999999
yeah the matrix is also science fiction

5345.199 --> 5349.12
that's right

5346.639 --> 5350.08
that's right did i say that it's

5349.12 --> 5355.04
absolute physical

5350.08 --> 5357.6
reality at any point tiny womble right

5355.04 --> 5358.96
this is all a simulation oh you were

5357.6 --> 5362.0
addressing zeptappy

5358.96 --> 5365.36
all right this isn't real life

5362.0 --> 5369.52
love think air you're breathing this is

5365.36 --> 5369.5199999999995
yeah yeah that that's very funny

5370.4 --> 5374.32
neo is real okay yeah well that's very

5373.52 --> 5376.159000000001
funny of you

5374.32 --> 5377.44
right but you are now literally

5376.159 --> 5380.0
projecting

5377.44 --> 5383.04
your psychosis may be controlled onto

5380.0 --> 5386.239
this situation when i was

5383.04 --> 5387.04
specifically specifically trying to

5386.239 --> 5391.199
emphasize

5387.04 --> 5394.0
keep fiction apart from reality

5391.199 --> 5394.879999999999
it's not good yeah psychosis yes what

5394.0 --> 5398.159
you just did

5394.88 --> 5400.159000000001
is for the fun of it project a little

5398.159 --> 5404.719
psychosis into the chat

5400.159 --> 5407.839999999999
by saying by quoting the matrix

5404.719 --> 5409.84
not really as a direct joke you didn't

5407.84 --> 5413.4400000000005
say like oh look this is the example

5409.84 --> 5415.360000000001
this is exactly an example right

5413.44 --> 5417.759999999999
no you literally just thought it was

5415.36 --> 5422.239
funny to in the moment as a troll

5417.76 --> 5425.52
reify that into reality as a joke right

5422.239 --> 5428.5599999999995
which makes the borders between fiction

5425.52 --> 5429.52
and reality a little fuzzy again because

5428.56 --> 5431.84
you like that

5429.52 --> 5434.320000000001
because you're a glober and globers

5431.84 --> 5437.4400000000005
don't like to have

5434.32 --> 5439.28
that distinction between fantasy

5437.44 --> 5441.04
and reality all that cleared up they

5439.28 --> 5441.599999999999
don't like it because then you really

5441.04 --> 5444.719
know

5441.6 --> 5448.0
you really know in the

5444.719 --> 5449.199
fibers of your being that the globe is a

5448.0 --> 5451.04
lie

5449.199 --> 5452.32
you don't like that so you'll cover it

5451.04 --> 5455.76
up with those

5452.32 --> 5457.44
fuzzy little jokes yeah and it's

5455.76 --> 5459.6
falls under psychotic behavior but

5457.44 --> 5461.839999999999
that's fine it's absolutely fine it's

5459.6 --> 5463.52
understandable you are a globe after all

5461.84 --> 5465.679
and you've been very well behaved

5463.52 --> 5468.080000000001
and i don't mind making you making that

5465.679 --> 5471.36
joke it's just that

5468.08 --> 5474.159
in after i just did this little speech

5471.36 --> 5477.12
about that it's very telling and i will

5474.159 --> 5478.719
absolutely replied and basically use you

5477.12 --> 5481.92
as an example in it

5478.719 --> 5481.92
friendly example though

5488.32 --> 5495.5199999999995
yes i know septeppe i know

5492.159 --> 5498.32
i don't think we are stuck in a computer

5495.52 --> 5500.0
that is projecting a virtual reality on

5498.32 --> 5500.96
to our senses i don't think that's the

5500.0 --> 5502.8
case

5500.96 --> 5504.32
i don't think we are brains in jars and

5502.8 --> 5507.6
we don't know it

5504.32 --> 5507.599999999999
i'm pretty certain we're not

5507.76 --> 5517.1990000000005
however the similarities to the setup

5514.48 --> 5518.0
that's another matter because i do think

5517.199 --> 5523.12
that this

5518.0 --> 5523.12
all this very physical reality itself is

5524.0 --> 5531.36
oh case in the christ a

5527.6 --> 5533.52
what i i don't know look i don't need

5531.36 --> 5534.159
people to start slandering this freak in

5533.52 --> 5536.8
my chat

5534.159 --> 5537.92
okay i don't know about him he doesn't

5536.8 --> 5542.400000000001
need

5537.92 --> 5546.32
like just ignore him but fine

5542.4 --> 5548.48
whatever who is this by the way look

5546.32 --> 5551.599999999999
who is doing that who are these socks

5548.48 --> 5551.599999999999
from who is this

5554.48 --> 5561.678999999999
i don't know who you are whatever

5557.6 --> 5565.04
anyway yeah the the

5561.679 --> 5567.4400000000005
physical reality we are in could be

5565.04 --> 5568.8
potentially as a as an experiment

5567.44 --> 5571.199
experiment it's an idea

5568.8 --> 5572.320000000001
it's tough to prove right tough to

5571.199 --> 5574.799999999999
actually follow up on

5572.32 --> 5576.96
real physical empirical proof but i

5574.8 --> 5580.0
suspect that the physical reality

5576.96 --> 5583.44
is a simulation

5580.0 --> 5586.0
but it's it's not like we are stuck

5583.44 --> 5587.839999999999
in a computer it's not real it's just

5586.0 --> 5589.28
like electronically projected now i

5587.84 --> 5592.56
think that the very

5589.28 --> 5594.639
physical matter itself is a simulation

5592.56 --> 5598.639
is simulatory

5594.639 --> 5602.4800000000005
in nature built as a simulation

5598.639 --> 5605.28
like a holodeck like a holodeck

5602.48 --> 5606.32
but yeah a holodeck is basically

5605.28 --> 5608.159
physically real

5606.32 --> 5610.159
as a real flesh and blood person you

5608.159 --> 5611.5199999999995
walk in now talking star trek right this

5610.159 --> 5614.159
is an example it's just a

5611.52 --> 5615.1990000000005
metaphor you walk into a holodeck you

5614.159 --> 5618.239
know these things

5615.199 --> 5620.48
are lights somehow

5618.239 --> 5622.08
causing force field and all that to

5620.48 --> 5624.4
emulate physical matter

5622.08 --> 5625.5199999999995
right and they have properties physical

5624.4 --> 5628.638999999999
matter

5625.52 --> 5631.92
well it might be closer to that

5628.639 --> 5635.28
except it is literally

5631.92 --> 5637.1990000000005
the only thing that is like it's all a

5635.28 --> 5640.96
giant hollow deck

5637.199 --> 5643.36
created by god but that

5640.96 --> 5644.08
still means it's real it's still real

5643.36 --> 5647.199
it's because

5644.08 --> 5650.0
it is the only physical reality and

5647.199 --> 5650.32
thus the only physical reality would be

5650.0 --> 5653.12
a

5650.32 --> 5653.599999999999
simulation of the creator that created

5653.12 --> 5656.639
it

5653.6 --> 5658.159000000001
and that's kind of how i see it but it's

5656.639 --> 5660.4800000000005
still philosophical

5658.159 --> 5660.48
you know

5664.239 --> 5672.0
six hour livestream wow really

5667.76 --> 5673.84
how special he must be really squirting

5672.0 --> 5676.08
in his pants over me

5673.84 --> 5678.2390000000005
i think he probably has a massive gay

5676.08 --> 5680.0
boner crush on me and he's just like

5678.239 --> 5682.799999999999
trying to whip his own dick to try and

5680.0 --> 5686.719
forget about me

5682.8 --> 5690.159000000001
i'd see him do that

5686.719 --> 5693.28
he's probably a guy that would like

5690.159 --> 5695.04
just i'm not gonna describe that i think

5693.28 --> 5696.48
whipping his own dick is probably enough

5695.04 --> 5702.159
hints

5696.48 --> 5702.159
i see him to be like that probably worse

5702.93 --> 5706.109
[Music]

5709.0 --> 5713.52
[Music]

5711.76 --> 5714.96
he has a scary voice i don't know what

5713.52 --> 5716.2390000000005
his voice is like i never heard him

5714.96 --> 5718.8
before but i heard it's pretty

5716.239 --> 5718.799999999999
disgusting

5722.4 --> 5727.36
i don't really give a [ __ ] i really

5724.4 --> 5730.5599999999995
don't there's nothing he can do

5727.36 --> 5734.239
nothing not a thing not a thing not

5730.56 --> 5737.52
a thing not a thing not a thing

5734.239 --> 5741.199
no lies will touch me no

5737.52 --> 5743.1990000000005
pressure will faze me you can physically

5741.199 --> 5744.879999999999
threaten me you can literally come to my

5743.199 --> 5748.08
door with a weapon in hand

5744.88 --> 5750.56
i am not going to do anything

5748.08 --> 5752.639
except i don't know if you actually do

5750.56 --> 5754.88
something kill you on the spot

5752.639 --> 5756.400000000001
as natural law because you are trying to

5754.88 --> 5758.719
assault me with a deadly weapon or

5756.4 --> 5762.159
something and then i will [ __ ]

5758.719 --> 5764.719
gut you on the spot really efficiently

5762.159 --> 5766.879999999999
and without mercy

5764.719 --> 5768.32
right but i don't think he's gonna do

5766.88 --> 5771.679
that ever

5768.32 --> 5774.0
so he's just squirting

5771.679 --> 5775.4400000000005
squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt

5774.0 --> 5778.08
squirt squirt squirt

5775.44 --> 5779.04
squirt squirt squirt squirt oh my god

5778.08 --> 5781.199
these are a win

5779.04 --> 5782.56
squirt squirt squirt squirt squirt

5781.199 --> 5785.28
squirts squirt squirt

5782.56 --> 5785.679
squirt squirt squirt squirt oh my god

5785.28 --> 5789.44
our

5785.679 --> 5792.0
win oh no this can be this guy must be

5789.44 --> 5794.32
stopped i can't handle it anymore

5792.0 --> 5795.52
let's imagine some more torture porn or

5794.32 --> 5798.159
something and

5795.52 --> 5799.84
squirt squirts words squirt squirt

5798.159 --> 5802.638999999999
squirt squirt yeah that's

5799.84 --> 5802.639
that's tony

5803.679 --> 5813.84
man that that guy must have some

5805.28 --> 5813.84
seriously drain balls by now i think

5815.84 --> 5819.6
okay yes happy well that's that's an

5818.0 --> 5822.159
interesting concept

5819.6 --> 5823.76
that that would that conception that you

5822.159 --> 5826.48
just put in there chat

5823.76 --> 5828.0
it does match with the simulatory nature

5826.48 --> 5832.08
of physical reality

5828.0 --> 5834.159
it might be it might be very close

5832.08 --> 5835.92
i do think that maybe all of our

5834.159 --> 5839.199
consciousness are like

5835.92 --> 5840.88
god having like spawned spirits and then

5839.199 --> 5842.48
from that spirit split up in more

5840.88 --> 5843.6
spirits in more spirits until there's

5842.48 --> 5845.759999999999
like a billion

5843.6 --> 5847.4400000000005
six billion people or however many there

5845.76 --> 5849.6
are supposedly in the world

5847.44 --> 5852.0
that are basically all crystalline

5849.6 --> 5852.0
spirit

5852.239 --> 5858.0
fragments of god like we are all

5856.0 --> 5859.52
fragments of god that have basically

5858.0 --> 5862.88
crystallized within

5859.52 --> 5864.400000000001
this physical emulation and that

5862.88 --> 5866.32
and with that also comes like an

5864.4 --> 5869.04
original philosophical purpose and that

5866.32 --> 5872.239
is that god created reality

5869.04 --> 5875.679
to learn to learn

5872.239 --> 5879.678999999999
about what he is because

5875.679 --> 5881.1990000000005
if it's only him and he knows all things

5879.679 --> 5882.96
then it doesn't mean anything and he

5881.199 --> 5885.678999999999
can't learn anything about him because

5882.96 --> 5888.4800000000005
he's all things so he basically

5885.679 --> 5889.52
created reality the physical reality and

5888.48 --> 5892.879999999999
all the spirits

5889.52 --> 5896.0
to learn about reality

5892.88 --> 5899.28
and what he is that's a philosophical

5896.0 --> 5903.52
statement right but that backs

5899.28 --> 5905.36
up also what you said in chat

5903.52 --> 5907.119000000001
is there a hierarchy in spirits no

5905.36 --> 5909.199
absolutely not

5907.119 --> 5910.96
there is no natural hierarchy there's

5909.199 --> 5913.28
only your capacity

5910.96 --> 5914.639
your actions your purity and your

5913.28 --> 5916.88
frequency

5914.639 --> 5918.0
and everything works on that it's all

5916.88 --> 5920.32
natural there's no

5918.0 --> 5922.159
set hierarchy there isn't it's only your

5920.32 --> 5924.639
capacity

5922.159 --> 5926.48
what you do what the frequency is and

5924.639 --> 5927.04
what the effect will be on others and

5926.48 --> 5930.239
then

5927.04 --> 5932.8
the hierarchy will naturally form

5930.239 --> 5935.5199999999995
naturally don't no words have to be

5932.8 --> 5939.84
spoken no papers have to be signed

5935.52 --> 5939.84
it's just naturally natural

5946.32 --> 5954.159
so everyone is equally spiritual

5949.44 --> 5954.159
no nobody's equal spiritual

5954.719 --> 5961.6
everybody's different it's just that

5958.639 --> 5963.6
whatever you do is going to reflect upon

5961.6 --> 5966.159000000001
how others respond to you

5963.6 --> 5968.4800000000005
one way or the other there's the path

5966.159 --> 5969.119
you cannot stand still on the path you

5968.48 --> 5971.759999999999
have to go

5969.119 --> 5972.799999999999
somewhere so choose your path carefully

5971.76 --> 5976.08
because

5972.8 --> 5977.84
you will always end up

5976.08 --> 5979.76
at the end of that path with everything

5977.84 --> 5983.28
that comes with it and that's it

5979.76 --> 5986.400000000001
nobody is equal nobody

5983.28 --> 5990.08
everybody is unique but we

5986.4 --> 5992.879999999999
all have traits and choices that we make

5990.08 --> 5995.92
that we may recognize in one another

5992.88 --> 5997.52
right we all share the same physical

5995.92 --> 6000.8
reality

5997.52 --> 6001.6
up to a certain degree but nobody is

6000.8 --> 6004.639
equal

6001.6 --> 6005.6
and there is no hierarchy the only

6004.639 --> 6008.96
hierarchy

6005.6 --> 6012.2390000000005
is what we do and how we reflect

6008.96 --> 6014.4800000000005
how others choose us choose where we

6012.239 --> 6016.799999999999
are in relation to them that's the only

6014.48 --> 6019.759999999999
real hierarchy

6016.8 --> 6021.04
there is no hierarchy and nobody is

6019.76 --> 6024.4800000000005
equal

6021.04 --> 6026.48
everybody is unique it's just hey if you

6024.48 --> 6027.839999999999
want to think that everybody is equal

6026.48 --> 6030.32
and that you're not unique

6027.84 --> 6031.52
then you may adapt yourself to that

6030.32 --> 6034.159
position

6031.52 --> 6035.280000000001
and with it lose your uniqueness it's

6034.159 --> 6038.48
your choice

6035.28 --> 6038.88
it's your choice to do it's not real

6038.48 --> 6041.839999999999
though

6038.88 --> 6042.400000000001
it's only your choice because everybody

6041.84 --> 6045.52
has

6042.4 --> 6048.159
choices all the choices

6045.52 --> 6050.159000000001
but you got to make a choice though you

6048.159 --> 6050.719
cannot not make a choice because you

6050.159 --> 6053.36
will

6050.719 --> 6054.639
run astray you will run into you will

6053.36 --> 6057.679
get stuck

6054.639 --> 6060.0
god forces the choice you must make the

6057.679 --> 6060.96
choice you have no choice about making a

6060.0 --> 6063.36
choice you must make

6060.96 --> 6064.719
a choice whatever choice but you must

6063.36 --> 6067.28
make it

6064.719 --> 6070.4800000000005
and that's natural consequence of how

6067.28 --> 6070.48
this reality works

6075.14 --> 6079.119000000001
[Music]

6077.6 --> 6081.52
right life is short make your decisions

6079.119 --> 6093.839999999999
wisely absolutely rob h

6081.52 --> 6093.84
absolutely certainly

6099.12 --> 6102.849999999999
[Music]

6102.88 --> 6110.639
yeah all right i need to

6106.8 --> 6110.639
eat a little rake i'll be back in two

6118.84 --> 6121.84
minutes

6253.679 --> 6261.84
what is that

6263.52 --> 6266.8
crucial reality kind of westworld here

6265.44 --> 6269.28
if you don't make them

6266.8 --> 6270.639
someone else will yeah that's that's a

6269.28 --> 6272.719
very good point i don't see what the

6270.639 --> 6275.84
hell that has to do with mandela effect

6272.719 --> 6275.84
thirst for truth

6276.88 --> 6282.4800000000005
oh yeah yeah you should probably

6280.239 --> 6284.48
just shut up about that nobody brought

6282.48 --> 6289.839999999999
that up you brought it up

6284.48 --> 6289.839999999999
right you brought it up don't do that

6290.96 --> 6294.4
so you're getting it you're getting a

6292.159 --> 6297.04
timeout

6294.4 --> 6298.159
right nobody said mandela effect you

6297.04 --> 6302.8
said mandela

6298.159 --> 6303.199
right you said it don't do that don't

6302.8 --> 6305.52
put

6303.199 --> 6307.919999999999
your [ __ ] into other people's shoes

6305.52 --> 6307.92
alright

6308.56 --> 6317.84
nobody's claiming it

6321.52 --> 6326.080000000001
time does not exist future and pests are

6323.28 --> 6326.08
not tangible

6327.119 --> 6330.88
that's a difficult one rob h you look in

6329.52 --> 6332.88
physics

6330.88 --> 6334.2390000000005
in physics right in physics you are

6332.88 --> 6336.08
correct

6334.239 --> 6338.48
but is physics the only thing that

6336.08 --> 6338.48
exists

6339.84 --> 6343.119000000001
or are there things like information in

6342.08 --> 6346.159
the spirit

6343.119 --> 6348.5599999999995
and things that are not like measurable

6346.159 --> 6350.0
in energy and all that you got to

6348.56 --> 6351.92
consider that as well

6350.0 --> 6353.119
before you over generalize such

6351.92 --> 6356.719
statements

6353.119 --> 6360.4
right time future and past

6356.719 --> 6364.88
do not exist in physics specifically

6360.4 --> 6367.36
right in the the the lore

6364.88 --> 6369.119
of the physical and natural world but

6367.36 --> 6373.839999999999
that doesn't mean

6369.119 --> 6373.839999999999
that there isn't anything

6375.6 --> 6379.679
oh oh really well go [ __ ] yourself them

6378.08 --> 6382.8
scumbag

6379.679 --> 6385.4400000000005
go [ __ ] yourself i can block and

6382.8 --> 6386.08
censor whoever the [ __ ] i want on my own

show you

6386.08 --> 6390.639

6393.199 --> 6396.719
it don't tune in go [ __ ] yourself you

6395.52 --> 6400.159000000001
scumbags

6396.719 --> 6403.04

6400.159 --> 6403.759999999999

i will kick your ass instantly no regret

6407.52 --> 6413.9400000000005

6410.8 --> 6415.1990000000005
go [ __ ] off

6413.94 --> 6418.5599999999995
[Music]

6415.199 --> 6418.96
i don't give a [ __ ] i will ban you all i

6418.56 --> 6423.04
don't

6418.96 --> 6425.119
give a [ __ ] i only care about people

6423.04 --> 6427.199
that are actually provably people and

6425.119 --> 6429.839999999999
that's a bunch of suck accounts

6427.199 --> 6431.199
some weirdo that just randomly came in

6429.84 --> 6434.2390000000005
you don't have a right

6431.199 --> 6435.5199999999995
you don't you don't have a right to free

6434.239 --> 6439.199
speech in my chat

6435.52 --> 6442.400000000001
if i choose that you don't you got it

6439.199 --> 6444.638999999999
you got it there's nothing you can do

6442.4 --> 6446.799999999999
about it you have no recourse

6444.639 --> 6448.0
this is how it's gonna be and if you

6446.8 --> 6457.84
complain about it i

6448.0 --> 6457.84
ban your ass okay good

6460.639 --> 6464.08
first truth is one of tony tarts i don't

6462.639 --> 6466.400000000001
know if he is

6464.08 --> 6468.32
i really care if he misbehaves then he

6466.4 --> 6470.159
misbehaves if he's just gonna project

6468.32 --> 6470.96
things onto people that they never even

6470.159 --> 6472.4
said

6470.96 --> 6474.639
then i'll time him out for it and if he

6472.4 --> 6477.04
continues then i ban him i don't care

6474.639 --> 6478.2390000000005
you know just because somebody follows

6477.04 --> 6480.08
this freak

6478.239 --> 6482.08
doesn't mean that they're automatically

6480.08 --> 6482.32
an evil person they might just be tuning

6482.08 --> 6483.92
in

6482.32 --> 6488.239
and like trying to figure out what was

6483.92 --> 6491.36
going on you know remember how many

6488.239 --> 6492.799999999999
ballers for people for example threw sai

6491.36 --> 6496.08
mandan

6492.8 --> 6498.0
this freak out there found like nathan

6496.08 --> 6501.199
oakley and found my channel and have

6498.0 --> 6503.92
actually stayed and followed

6501.199 --> 6505.5199999999995
you know they don't all have to be evil

6503.92 --> 6507.84
and insane

6505.52 --> 6509.280000000001
just because they follow this evil and

6507.84 --> 6511.04
insane person

6509.28 --> 6512.32
right so you got to give everybody a

6511.04 --> 6515.28
chance

6512.32 --> 6515.92
if you obviously are very similar to

6515.28 --> 6518.48
this guy

6515.92 --> 6519.28
you just echo disgusting behavior at

6518.48 --> 6521.04
home attacks

6519.28 --> 6523.679
accusations that literally come out of

6521.04 --> 6525.04
nowhere yet then you eventually will get

6523.679 --> 6526.8
banned

6525.04 --> 6529.84
i don't care who you are where you came

6526.8 --> 6531.84
from i only look at the behavior

6529.84 --> 6533.52
and at your methodology and at your

6531.84 --> 6535.92
spirit and in your frequency

6533.52 --> 6536.96
and i can see it you cannot hide it no

6535.92 --> 6539.04
matter what you do

6536.96 --> 6540.159
you can try to hide it it won't work i

6539.04 --> 6542.239
will see it

6540.159 --> 6544.08
right through it i will see it better

6542.239 --> 6545.759999999999
than you see it

6544.08 --> 6548.08
yeah because you can hide things from

6545.76 --> 6551.1990000000005
yourself you can hide things from me

6548.08 --> 6553.76
you can't sorry you just can't

6551.199 --> 6555.36
i'm arwen i'm a [ __ ] wizard and i can

6553.76 --> 6558.159000000001
see right through you

6555.36 --> 6560.48
i don't even have to physically see you

6558.159 --> 6562.799999999999
just a few words and i can see it

6560.48 --> 6565.119
nothing you can do about it you don't

6562.8 --> 6568.320000000001
have to believe it

6565.119 --> 6571.5199999999995
i just know i can right

6568.32 --> 6573.36
so yeah do whatever if you come from

6571.52 --> 6575.52
tony's channel and you're here in my

6573.36 --> 6578.5599999999995
chat checking me out that's fine do it

6575.52 --> 6580.56
that's okay right if you're just gonna

6578.56 --> 6582.400000000001
throw out things like napoleon complex

6580.56 --> 6584.56
which makes no [ __ ] sense

6582.4 --> 6585.5199999999995
like how what the hell does that have to

6584.56 --> 6588.8
do

6585.52 --> 6590.88
this is like random [ __ ] what you you

6588.8 --> 6592.320000000001
you read something in a psychological in

6590.88 --> 6594.2390000000005
a psychology book as

6592.32 --> 6596.0
as a complex and now you thought oh this

6594.239 --> 6600.0
is napoleon complex oh

6596.0 --> 6603.04
right how do you know what that is

6600.0 --> 6605.36
where where did i mention napoleon you

6603.04 --> 6608.32
know that napoleon complex

6605.36 --> 6610.639
is people actually believing they are

6608.32 --> 6612.4
napoleon right that's napoleon complex

6610.639 --> 6614.96
you obviously don't know that

6612.4 --> 6616.0
you're just throwing random psychology

6614.96 --> 6618.159
terminologies

6616.0 --> 6620.159
in here and think you're smart no you

6618.159 --> 6622.239
are a [ __ ] [ __ ]

6620.159 --> 6625.44
a [ __ ] [ __ ] that make that's making

6622.239 --> 6627.199
basis accusation and now you're banned

6625.44 --> 6631.119
because you're [ __ ] [ __ ] in a waste

6627.199 --> 6631.119
of time so go [ __ ] yourself

6636.84 --> 6639.84
[ __ ]

6645.679 --> 6650.4800000000005
ah i'll keep on trying but that's fine

6648.8 --> 6653.1990000000005
you know these trolls are more amusing

6650.48 --> 6655.28
than the baller trolls though

6653.199 --> 6656.239
these guys are like halfway trying

6655.28 --> 6659.28
something

6656.239 --> 6660.08
absolutely utterly failing at least

6659.28 --> 6662.639
they're trying

6660.08 --> 6664.8
something it's not just like basically

6662.639 --> 6667.92
squirting and already faltering even if

6664.8 --> 6669.4400000000005
they haven't finished this sentence yet

6667.92 --> 6671.84
which is kind of the trolls that i had

6669.44 --> 6671.839999999999
before

6672.48 --> 6675.598999999999
these people are actually thinking that

6674.48 --> 6678.879999999999
they are are

6675.599 --> 6680.8
getting somewhere somehow by

6678.88 --> 6682.2390000000005
just throwing out blind accusations that

6680.8 --> 6684.400000000001
have no grip on

6682.239 --> 6685.28
anything anybody has ever said here

6684.4 --> 6686.96
including me

6685.28 --> 6689.199
including anybody in chat literally it's

6686.96 --> 6690.639
like they bring out a new terminology

6689.199 --> 6692.638999999999
it's like oh that's so smart a new

6690.639 --> 6694.4800000000005
terminology that you're accusing people

6692.639 --> 6698.0
of hmm

6694.48 --> 6699.119
do you know what it is apparently you

6698.0 --> 6700.639
don't you just

6699.119 --> 6702.719
looked up something in a list and

6700.639 --> 6705.04
thought oh wait i can say this

6702.719 --> 6706.159
yeah yeah you don't understand what the

6705.04 --> 6708.88
[ __ ] you're doing

6706.159 --> 6710.638999999999
you're a dumbass and you're just here to

6708.88 --> 6712.8
try and pin

6710.639 --> 6714.2390000000005
bad things on people because you're a

6712.8 --> 6715.4400000000005
[ __ ] dumbass you don't know what the

6714.239 --> 6723.839999999999
[ __ ] you're talking about

6715.44 --> 6723.839999999999
get the [ __ ] out right

6727.04 --> 6732.56
pauline always hit his hand well that's

6728.88 --> 6734.56
not napoleon complex though bit of venom

6732.56 --> 6736.639
that's just part of his act now people

6734.56 --> 6739.280000000001
that have napoleon complex they will do

6736.639 --> 6741.04
everything they can to really make

6739.28 --> 6742.639
people believe that they are napoleon so

6741.04 --> 6744.639
they will do that hand thing and they

6742.639 --> 6746.159000000001
will try to get the special hat

6744.639 --> 6748.08
and everything and they will try to talk

6746.159 --> 6749.36
like napoleon discuss the subjects of

6748.08 --> 6751.5199999999995
napoleon

6749.36 --> 6754.239
because that is what napoleon complex is

6751.52 --> 6755.92
but this stupid [ __ ] in chat

6754.239 --> 6757.5199999999995
didn't know that he just looked

6755.92 --> 6759.28
something up in a list and thought he

6757.52 --> 6760.639
was squat throwing out a blind

6759.28 --> 6765.84
accusation

6760.639 --> 6765.84
because he's a [ __ ] dumbass

6765.85 --> 6770.159000000001
[Music]

6768.239 --> 6771.598999999999
should be running for political office

6770.159 --> 6775.96
oh that no

6771.599 --> 6778.88
yeah okey-dokey

6775.96 --> 6783.679
okey-dokey that's not gonna

6778.88 --> 6785.84
get messy at all like

6783.679 --> 6787.679
although yeah this it's something that i

6785.84 --> 6791.76
considered like

6787.679 --> 6793.36
20 30 years ago it's just that

6791.76 --> 6795.119000000001
i don't want to spend the rest of my

6793.36 --> 6798.799999999999
life sitting in between the

6795.119 --> 6801.598999999999
worst most disgusting people imaginable

6798.8 --> 6803.1990000000005
that'll spend all their energy all day

6801.599 --> 6805.52
long through social media

6803.199 --> 6807.598999999999
through face-to-face [ __ ] trying to make

6805.52 --> 6808.8
my life miserable and accusing me of

6807.599 --> 6811.360000000001
being new hitler

6808.8 --> 6812.4800000000005
of being everything that is evil and

6811.36 --> 6815.759999999999
literally writing

6812.48 --> 6819.199
books about that [ __ ] because they

6815.76 --> 6821.52
yeah because i'm the counter opposite in

6819.199 --> 6823.199
every conceivable fashion of everything

6821.52 --> 6826.2390000000005
that they are

6823.199 --> 6827.28
i don't know if that's a great idea you

6826.239 --> 6829.759999999999
know i think that

6827.28 --> 6832.0
me being here on youtube and just being

6829.76 --> 6833.92
a flat earther and being my honest self

6832.0 --> 6834.719
is already enough hassle for the time

6833.92 --> 6836.96
being

6834.719 --> 6838.56
but who knows i've said before look if

6836.96 --> 6840.639
people are literally

6838.56 --> 6842.2390000000005
going to like come to me and say like no

6840.639 --> 6844.2390000000005
you are going to do this

6842.239 --> 6845.919999999999
you are going to be the president of

6844.239 --> 6848.718999999999
this

6845.92 --> 6849.36
then who am i to argue with that i'll do

6848.719 --> 6852.0
it

6849.36 --> 6852.639
but i'm not going to sacrifice

6852.0 --> 6855.84
everything

6852.639 --> 6856.719
just for a shot at that i i don't want

6855.84 --> 6859.679
to waste

6856.719 --> 6860.8
my momentum on that it's not worth it

6859.679 --> 6864.08
but hey if people

6860.8 --> 6864.4800000000005
need me if they need me my country needs

6864.08 --> 6867.199
me

6864.48 --> 6868.239
for real if they come to me they have a

6867.199 --> 6871.36
proposition

6868.239 --> 6872.239
well i might help them out but overall i

6871.36 --> 6875.36
prefer to just

6872.239 --> 6878.08
not get entangled with the really

6875.36 --> 6880.32
[ __ ] up [ __ ] out there like the

6878.08 --> 6881.44
massive massive lie campaigns and all

6880.32 --> 6883.04
that

6881.44 --> 6884.96
that are out there i don't like to be

6883.04 --> 6887.76
involved with that it's too disgusting

6884.96 --> 6892.88
it literally nauseates me

6887.76 --> 6892.88
right so it's not my first pick

6893.119 --> 6897.04
a life coach instead well i am a life

6896.0 --> 6900.32
coach

6897.04 --> 6902.4
i am my own life coach and i offer my

6900.32 --> 6903.04
services to others as well i'm here for

6902.4 --> 6906.719
learning

6903.04 --> 6908.88
with everything so in a technical sense

6906.719 --> 6910.2390000000005
i am sort of a life coach right here

6908.88 --> 6912.8
live online

6910.239 --> 6914.718999999999
and yeah you can contact me on skype

6912.8 --> 6915.76

and i do private consult i do private

6918.56 --> 6925.280000000001
talks

6920.719 --> 6928.2390000000005
like sometimes three and a half hours

6925.28 --> 6930.4
with people one-on-one no not on record

6928.239 --> 6933.919999999999
nothing recorded it's just

6930.4 --> 6936.719
being being me the person

6933.92 --> 6937.679
sizing them up getting to know them and

6936.719 --> 6940.639
giving advice

6937.679 --> 6942.719
and taking advice because i take advice

6940.639 --> 6945.28
too you know sometimes i'm not perfect

6942.719 --> 6946.08
i have issues sometimes i have obstacles

6945.28 --> 6947.36
emotionally

6946.08 --> 6949.199
that i don't know how to deal with them

6947.36 --> 6952.96
and i need to tell somebody

6949.199 --> 6955.678999999999
in confidence right so i share

6952.96 --> 6955.679
that's what i do

6956.159 --> 6962.719
but yeah effectively life coach yes

6959.28 --> 6965.759999999999
i for myself i'm a life coach for myself

6962.719 --> 6965.76
i have always have been

6967.119 --> 6970.96
three and a half consultation costs what

6969.679 --> 6975.36
you want to pay me for that

6970.96 --> 6979.52
really okay

6975.36 --> 6981.92
well it depends on who you are but

6979.52 --> 6984.0
with the people that i've had that long

6981.92 --> 6987.1990000000005
talk with i do it for free

6984.0 --> 6990.08
because i wanted to because i like those

6987.199 --> 6993.759999999999
people and i think that they deserved

6990.08 --> 6995.84
my help or at least my my personal

6993.76 --> 6999.599
attention

6995.84 --> 7001.360000000001
but look if you want to

6999.599 --> 7002.719
if you want some kind of counsel or

7001.36 --> 7006.0
something sure

7002.719 --> 7008.08
contact me and i don't know

7006.0 --> 7009.599
it depends on what kind of money you

7008.08 --> 7009.92
make you know it always does it's kind

7009.599 --> 7012.32
of

7009.92 --> 7013.4400000000005
annoying to me if you're poor as [ __ ]

7012.32 --> 7016.08
i'm not gonna

7013.44 --> 7017.839999999999
ask you to basically give every last

7016.08 --> 7020.4
cent you got

7017.84 --> 7022.400000000001
but hey if you're doing well then yeah

7020.4 --> 7025.04
of course i will ask

7022.4 --> 7026.638999999999
something if that's going to be the

7025.04 --> 7029.28
angle of approach

7026.639 --> 7031.76
if you really specifically want console

7029.28 --> 7035.599
consultation

7031.76 --> 7037.280000000001
yeah but anyway

7035.599 --> 7039.4400000000005
if you're serious about that deep truth

7037.28 --> 7042.84
i don't know who you are i just came in
