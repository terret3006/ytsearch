periodically coming a lot of noise from

90.68 --> 96.83000000000001
down there because they're working at

92.54 --> 101.42
the street earlier they were yeah what

96.83 --> 104.24
is it vibrate pushing a giant steel

101.42 --> 106.369
pillar straight into the ground I think

104.24 --> 109.19
they're doing some kind of foundation

106.369 --> 112.28
for new small bridge work there or

109.19 --> 116.14999999999999
something but they stopped for now thank

112.28 --> 118.78
God because it's very loud but yeah I

116.15 --> 125.93
don't really see any chemtrails today

118.78 --> 130.459
although oh wait I take that back over

125.93 --> 133.45000000000002
there but I don't know they don't seem

130.459 --> 133.45000000000002
to linger very much

135.05 --> 142.34900000000002
all right so yeah yesterday was a total

140.28 --> 147.9
blast

142.349 --> 149.79
I have minty with me only and thank you

147.9 --> 152.27
good servant for the $1 super chat

149.79 --> 152.26999999999998
donation

162.68 --> 169.58
but yeah yesterday was was very exciting

168.39 --> 174.17999999999998
for me it was like a little adventure

169.58 --> 183.36
it's not that special but I I don't know

174.18 --> 185.73000000000002
I felt strong I was well aware of what

183.36 --> 188.10000000000002
could potentially enroll and I was

185.73 --> 190.53
already I had already even with my

188.1 --> 192.12
friend conversed about it like yeah if I

190.53 --> 193.95
don't like the atmosphere if I don't

192.12 --> 197.489
feel good I'm just gonna go so I already

193.95 --> 199.35
decided upon that to stay protected and

197.489 --> 201.59
not just force myself to sit through

199.35 --> 204.45
something I wouldn't like but it was all

201.59 --> 210.209
really good and the people were really

204.45 --> 212.64
nice and it was funny because it indeed

210.209 --> 218.75
was kind of like in a bit of an older

212.64 --> 222.39
crowd tied into that location debajo

218.75 --> 225.0
specifically and even from walking from

222.39 --> 229.98
the station to that place I bumped into

225.0 --> 234.98
a guy who used to be a was it a like a

229.98 --> 238.73899999999998
stage guy who would build up stages for

234.98 --> 241.07899999999998
yeah for for for rock stars and [Â __Â ]

238.739 --> 244.29
back in the day from widom temptation he

241.079 --> 245.85
worked for a bit apparently so yeah that

244.29 --> 249.48
was funny I kind of recognized him but

245.85 --> 251.91
we had a wide conversation even even

249.48 --> 254.48899999999998
mention flat earth for a moment and he

251.91 --> 259.32
he wasn't surprised at all so that was

254.489 --> 261.15
interesting he didn't go to that party

259.32 --> 266.31
however he was just getting groceries it

261.15 --> 271.44
was funny but yeah the party itself the

266.31 --> 274.229
music was it was very diverse there were

271.44 --> 277.59
like three live bands they all put in a

274.229 --> 280.13
lot of effort first band was kind of

277.59 --> 283.919
like two but it was typically electro

280.13 --> 288.21
one guy one girl with the keyboard

283.919 --> 291.29999999999995
guitar and singing it was a bit do mesh

288.21 --> 292.08
so yeah I guess it's not my favorite but

291.3 --> 295.139
they

292.08 --> 296.87899999999996
did it very well melodically so I was

295.139 --> 299.43
kind of like yeah okay they're doing it

296.879 --> 301.259
arrived but it's not really what I want

299.43 --> 304.62
to feel right now but yeah that was the

301.259 --> 307.56
first band the second band was just like

304.62 --> 310.02
an old guard rock band at first their

307.56 --> 312.18
first song was got a wish it was so

310.02 --> 315.599
casual I thought like wow this sounds

312.18 --> 318.419
like a camping band like super bland

315.599 --> 323.4
rock but as they build up and they went

318.419 --> 326.729
for a long time they they became more

323.4 --> 329.63899999999995
serious Rock and like very powerful

326.729 --> 332.159
feeling based rock with personal

329.639 --> 333.75
conflict it was very inspiring and they

332.159 --> 339.33
were all having a blast they were

333.75 --> 341.909
crushing it it was good stuff got

339.33 --> 344.81899999999996
atmosphere and last band

341.909 --> 348.09
Janna was a bit of weird in a way they

344.819 --> 352.529
were kind of Californian so it was like

348.09 --> 354.23999999999995
okay wasn't my favorite they did do a

352.529 --> 357.15
very good job though they were

354.24 --> 360.93
technically very good and they were

357.15 --> 366.44899999999996
creative and the style was a bit odd

360.93 --> 369.029
though at times like but yeah overall

366.449 --> 373.11
great evening had a couple of beers too

369.029 --> 376.319
non-organic really yeah I wasn't gonna

373.11 --> 378.06
bring my own being just a few but I do

376.319 --> 379.77000000000004
feel that now I'd like there's a big

378.06 --> 383.909
difference when they drink it on organic

379.77 --> 390.21
beer I do feel it the next day great

383.909 --> 392.43
time good fun and yeah got to dance even

390.21 --> 398.00899999999996
a little it's good stuff

392.43 --> 401.40000000000003
oh and I had a I had a smoke room

398.009 --> 403.949
conversation with a woman happened to be

401.4 --> 406.37
a psychology and like we broke open the

403.949 --> 411.86
story cans from both sides and was

406.37 --> 414.68
thought she was kind of attractive but

411.86 --> 419.72
yeah as I said I had a really good time

414.68 --> 420.17
was very in and they're fading in a good

419.72 --> 423.67
way

420.17 --> 427.34000000000003
alright a might not know I'm not a not

423.67 --> 431.03000000000003
Ivan no I'm not a musician not really no

427.34 --> 433.66999999999996
no no not at all actually I played on a

431.03 --> 435.46
stage wand as a bassist player but it

433.67 --> 438.23
was ridiculous

435.46 --> 439.46
and I was so stoned out of my mind I

438.23 --> 441.86
didn't even know where I was

439.46 --> 445.88
that is what that was also because I was

441.86 --> 448.58000000000004
got it scared doing that but no you know

445.88 --> 455.51
other than that that's a long time ago

448.58 --> 458.2
was really silly yeah music can't

455.51 --> 458.2
connect people

463.1 --> 470.8
but for me also it was interesting we

466.43 --> 473.71
got because I got a look into just I

470.8 --> 478.01
guess the good science side of the

473.71 --> 479.87
underground ish gothic scene it's not so

478.01 --> 482.99
gothic anymore like I was one of the

479.87 --> 484.94
most gothic looking people there and my

482.99 --> 488.39
friend and a couple of others but most

484.94 --> 491.48
were just kind of casual but I'm pretty

488.39 --> 497.53
sure that they all used to do that more

491.48 --> 497.53000000000003
phonetically but it was just good to see

497.74 --> 503.66
that just all these people there were no

501.05 --> 510.5
nasty people there at all they were all

503.66 --> 513.59
good and yeah you know sometimes the

510.5 --> 517.0
problem is with old memories the really

513.59 --> 519.289
nasty ones seemed to linger and

517.0 --> 522.41
overcrowd the good ones but i forget

519.289 --> 524.15
that in reality there's just a lot of

522.41 --> 526.28
good people in that scene and that is

524.15 --> 529.0
also what I did appreciate and kind of

526.28 --> 529.0
trust about it

542.37 --> 548.529
right anyway so that was yeah I know

545.68 --> 552.2489999999999
California is a weird place but with

548.529 --> 555.67
California it's they were clearly

552.249 --> 558.49
American they were clearly American

555.67 --> 560.259
liberals you could just see at the way

558.49 --> 562.72
they composed themselves the way to look

560.259 --> 567.879
there were really kind of hipsterish in

562.72 --> 570.9100000000001
style modestly so not insane but it's

567.879 --> 573.5500000000001
just that bands from the California

570.91 --> 576.73
region there is this style to that that

573.55 --> 579.43
I did not just recognize from typical

576.73 --> 582.5790000000001
bands from that region Red Hot Chili

579.43 --> 584.4989999999999
Peppers as the as more than anything to

582.579 --> 591.12
California it's just the Californian

584.499 --> 593.74
style I don't know I just recognized it

591.12 --> 598.089
but they'd yeah they were still pretty

593.74 --> 600.16
good great evening but I really love

598.089 --> 602.5290000000001
that rock band they were all like older

600.16 --> 604.42
rockers in their 40s and 50s but they

602.529 --> 608.35
were having such a crushing time in the

604.42 --> 613.05
and was all from the heart like really

608.35 --> 613.0500000000001
serious I loved it like that's good rock

620.39 --> 623.48
[Music]

630.91 --> 640.029
it would make a deal that could be but

634.809 --> 645.4889999999999
anyway I hope you guys get what I mean

640.029 --> 658.569
when I say California style music my

645.489 --> 663.1600000000001
friend got it going it told her Marilyn

658.569 --> 666.759
Manson that's interesting well I haven't

663.16 --> 669.91
really got caught up to what he's been

666.759 --> 675.429
doing I never really appreciated his

669.91 --> 681.1
music it's like good enough but the the

675.429 --> 682.9889999999999
context was poison and I don't know if

681.1 --> 688.859
you're really naive then you don't see

682.989 --> 692.7090000000001
that but for me it seemed like this yeah

688.859 --> 698.759
yeah Tom Parker I get it I agree and I

692.709 --> 700.419
think he even publicly said that I don't

698.759 --> 703.389
never been my thing

700.419 --> 706.569
like even when I was more deeply in the

703.389 --> 708.759
gothic scene there was still a lot of

706.569 --> 712.139
bands that I didn't like or that it was

708.759 --> 712.139
really repulsed by even

727.49 --> 736.67
you don't listen to music anymore numb

730.19 --> 739.1
good servant huh well I don't listen as

736.67 --> 741.11
much music as I used to I used to like

739.1 --> 744.23
constantly play that [Â __Â ] but I kind of

741.11 --> 749.54
used it as escapism so in a way I guess

744.23 --> 751.88
I abused it now I I just used music to

749.54 --> 754.64
set a tone or to get my mind off

751.88 --> 757.22
something quickly because sometimes I

754.64 --> 759.08
get songs stuck in my head that I really

757.22 --> 760.82
don't want in there and that that

759.08 --> 765.14
happened recently I discovered an old

760.82 --> 768.529
song and I'm really wanting to forget

765.14 --> 778.61
that because it's just not me this time

768.529 --> 784.36
it's wrong yeah even gonna hint at what

778.61 --> 784.36
that song is nobody knows it anyway

794.82 --> 807.87
poison the mind that's a bit it's kind

803.38 --> 807.87
of a wide statement there secular music

810.52 --> 819.3389999999999
I don't know for me look music can

817.57 --> 822.85
really stand and fall just by the

819.339 --> 827.2600000000001
message and that doesn't have to be you

822.85 --> 830.26
know those people can be a theists as

827.26 --> 832.66
long as they're being honest and

830.26 --> 835.27
honorable and all that in their

832.66 --> 837.779
struggles and all that that shows that

835.27 --> 843.97
shows with the tone of what they put out

837.779 --> 847.57
you know and sometimes people even just

843.97 --> 849.22
like call themselves atheist but they

847.57 --> 850.8100000000001
are kind of religious but they just

849.22 --> 855.149
don't want to talk about it keep it

850.81 --> 855.149
secret I don't know

862.85 --> 867.8100000000001
that always gotta be the subject let

866.91 --> 870.3199999999999
sapling

867.81 --> 870.3199999999999
really

879.36 --> 885.989
I always did kind of even to this day

883.949 --> 887.429
and in a special way appreciate the

885.989 --> 891.4200000000001
doors even though that

887.429 --> 894.98
yeah the darkness is like addressed even

891.42 --> 902.8789999999999
like there's a lot of very dark [Â __Â ]

894.98 --> 904.549
dwelling around in that music but it

902.879 --> 909.749
still thought it was like really

904.549 --> 911.91
interesting at times like there's

909.749 --> 916.47
something about just the way they play

911.91 --> 920.16
the music often that it's suitable as

916.47 --> 924.779
like background room music for a party

920.16 --> 927.569
and it does spread this weird tone it's

924.779 --> 930.209
interesting but I guess that yeah it's

927.569 --> 932.899
not not for everyone maybe that is just

930.209 --> 932.899
a gothic thing

940.59 --> 946.02
yeah but I definitely don't like

942.81 --> 949.02
listening to the doors on and never did

946.02 --> 951.51
that in the past - but I just as the

949.02 --> 951.9
music style itself I really appreciate

951.51 --> 955.04
it

951.9 --> 955.04
so very careful

972.84 --> 978.14
right Fyodor Dostoevsky yeah and I agree

1172.52 --> 1175.99
what are you guys talking about

1192.909 --> 1198.95
Yeah right yeah if this is about

1195.799 --> 1203.35
freemasons then I agree with Bates here

1198.95 --> 1206.029
I think that a lot of freemasons

1203.35 --> 1208.73
let go especially the ones that like to

1206.029 --> 1211.76
dress up with all their medals and all

1208.73 --> 1215.24
that to them it's kind of like a men and

1211.76 --> 1217.19
men's knitting club what used to be like

1215.24 --> 1220.01
a knitting club for women get together

1217.19 --> 1224.26
babble babble babble it knitting it and

1220.01 --> 1227.779
having a great time because they love it

1224.26 --> 1229.94
usually when they do that and this is

1227.779 --> 1232.61
for like no amend among another and

1229.94 --> 1235.8500000000001
their fantasies and their projects and

1232.61 --> 1242.4499999999998
they're they're building stuffs and

1235.85 --> 1246.1299999999999
their concepts again when she's a gem no

1242.45 --> 1252.0800000000002
it's it's like a hobby club for men and

1246.13 --> 1253.73
fooling around and I guess with some it

1252.08 --> 1257.36
would go very far and they would have

1253.73 --> 1259.76
like seek I guess secret clubs like

1257.36 --> 1265.639
having secrets among one another a lot

1259.76 --> 1271.48
of them think that's interesting so yeah

1265.639 --> 1271.4799999999998
I think that most Freemasons are

1272.01 --> 1281.52
I don't know I've really haven't at

1278.88 --> 1286.44
least yeah it's the last time I think I

1281.52 --> 1289.65
spoke to one I think that was right

1286.44 --> 1293.1200000000001
those were the the colleagues of my

1289.65 --> 1298.02
grandfather I spoke to some of them I

1293.12 --> 1300.0
think there was that was like right

1298.02 --> 1302.36
after he had died when I was 16 or

1300.0 --> 1302.36
something

1305.37 --> 1311.6399999999999
and they asked me about Star Wars that

1307.83 --> 1313.5
was funny because I was I was like very

1311.64 --> 1315.45
proud like I'm smart I'm smart I want to

1313.5 --> 1320.1
learn I want to get connections like

1315.45 --> 1322.5
yeah see you thing with energies and and

1320.1 --> 1324.27
good hope and they were like did you do

1322.5 --> 1326.49
you like Star Wars and I was like oh

1324.27 --> 1330.0
yeah that is so super awesome I love it

1326.49 --> 1334.02
and you saw his disappointment like okay

1330.0 --> 1336.39
then he wanted to break flat earth to me

1334.02 --> 1342.45
but he thought I wouldn't be able to

1336.39 --> 1344.4
handle it and in a way he probably was

1342.45 --> 1345.99
right because on the first response I

1344.4 --> 1347.7900000000002
probably would have been able to handle

1345.99 --> 1351.59
it and then later on realized the

1347.79 --> 1357.03
implications and go into panic because

1351.59 --> 1358.7099999999998
think that sort of happened before but

1357.03 --> 1360.75
yeah that's the only time I really

1358.71 --> 1363.15
remembered that knowingly that they were

1360.75 --> 1366.77
freemasons and they were pretty harmless

1363.15 --> 1373.679
I think they were really polite and

1366.77 --> 1379.92
careful and gentlemanly and curious they

1373.679 --> 1382.95
were very curious but yeah on a personal

1379.92 --> 1388.02
level like they didn't know anything

1382.95 --> 1391.8
about my mother because my grandfather

1388.02 --> 1393.809
literally never talked about his old

1391.8 --> 1400.3799999999999
family that he abandoned and that is bad

1393.809 --> 1403.46
yeah no logos there yeah but yeah it

1400.38 --> 1403.46
made it kind of a mystery

1406.299 --> 1409.799
to them I guess

1414.9 --> 1427.26
she's a gem what the come on dude it's

1423.97 --> 1427.26
too much there

1427.49 --> 1435.859
[Music]

1439.0 --> 1441.69
all right

1452.23 --> 1454.83
huh

1467.87 --> 1474.279
you have a good point there Fyodor

1470.0 --> 1474.279
Dostoevsky I think that a lot of

1474.52 --> 1486.789
renaming happened after World War two

1480.77 --> 1486.789
and a lot of migration soon

1498.27 --> 1513.79
yes Clark yeah peanuts Clark

1506.74 --> 1516.82
it's called privacy privacy but yeah

1513.79 --> 1522.19
look I'm not saying ooh freemasons the

1516.82 --> 1524.56
[Â __Â ] you know I'm just saying I think it

1522.19 --> 1529.69
is a bit over being overblown being

1524.56 --> 1532.1499999999999
overhyped and at the same time yeah I'm

1529.69 --> 1535.3300000000002
not gonna say that there isn't any

1532.15 --> 1537.8200000000002
creepy [Â __Â ] going on anywhere but I

1535.33 --> 1540.79
think that the majority that of them are

1537.82 --> 1543.49
just completely out of the loop or they

1540.79 --> 1544.99
have heard hints about it and just were

1543.49 --> 1546.46
like oh no no I don't want to have

1544.99 --> 1549.04
anything to do with that I just want to

1546.46 --> 1551.74
do my thing here please don't bother me

1549.04 --> 1555.54
with that or something in that direction

1551.74 --> 1555.54
you know

1557.6 --> 1569.539
[Music]

1560.179 --> 1569.539
yeah but I don't know maybe I'm wrong

1572.81 --> 1575.9199999999998
[Music]

1576.72 --> 1583.109
peanuts Clark I I don't even want to

1579.659 --> 1586.1090000000002
want to guess what that would be I am

1583.109 --> 1589.499
really not interesting to fantasize what

1586.109 --> 1591.299
groups of people are disgustingly do it

1589.499 --> 1593.429
it's not something I like to dwell upon

1591.299 --> 1595.83
and find it very worrisome when they out

1593.429 --> 1598.3090000000002
see other people do that constantly it's

1595.83 --> 1598.309
terrible

1629.92 --> 1633.18
what's going on here

1636.42 --> 1644.5900000000001
yeah well the studio 68 has kind of a

1640.78 --> 1649.66
point or at least so I've understood

1644.59 --> 1654.1299999999999
about the degrees that story has echo

1649.66 --> 1657.72
down a bit even in the previous decade

1654.13 --> 1660.97
through interesting sources on YouTube

1657.72 --> 1665.559
so that I think there's something to

1660.97 --> 1668.88
that and that most people just go to 32

1665.559 --> 1668.8799999999999
and leave it there

1691.14 --> 1695.24
hmm your your being just

1695.36 --> 1704.1799999999998
stop being a devil persecuting fantasies

1701.33 --> 1705.86
please it's very annoying and people do

1704.18 --> 1710.17
that it's a bad habit it's not

1705.86 --> 1710.1699999999998
productive it's not crystallized like

1715.52 --> 1731.0
don't over blow things yeah and about

1729.35 --> 1733.58
that you're probably right

1731.0 --> 1738.289
look there's the the deeper secret

1733.58 --> 1741.77
societies and they do meddle with these

1738.289 --> 1746.179
groups but not just Freemasons they

1741.77 --> 1749.23
meddle with a lot of groups they just

1746.179 --> 1749.23
get involved

1758.62 --> 1765.61
I'm pretty sure AGM that Jesus didn't

1761.65 --> 1768.0700000000002
tell you to go and have extreme paranoid

1765.61 --> 1771.25
fantasies of like the worst possible

1768.07 --> 1773.8899999999999
outcome every time there's something

1771.25 --> 1776.669
hidden from you I'm pretty sure that

1773.89 --> 1781.419
Jesus didn't tell you to do that

1776.669 --> 1783.76
you know vigilance is one thing but when

1781.419 --> 1786.01
you then start to draw conclusions based

1783.76 --> 1799.69
on things you haven't seen or witnessed

1786.01 --> 1803.049
then things go bad hey I'm stop it you

1799.69 --> 1805.8400000000001
stop the Cape's stop the raving or I'm

1803.049 --> 1807.76
taking away your wrench because you're

1805.84 --> 1811.32
you're going out of control here it's

1807.76 --> 1811.32
very unpleasant don't do that

1825.14 --> 1828.259
[Music]

1831.56 --> 1835.6799999999998
[Music]

1844.13 --> 1851.8600000000001
yeah AGM you're misbehaving you're

1848.87 --> 1851.86
sowing paranoia

1856.49 --> 1861.56
they're going too far you know it's good

1859.19 --> 1874.0700000000002
to be vigilant but don't start sowing

1861.56 --> 1875.8999999999999
creepy ideas hey and if hey look if they

1874.07 --> 1879.8
get caught doing that kind of [Â __Â ] oh

1875.9 --> 1883.3100000000002
yeah of course you know address them to

1879.8 --> 1885.9199999999998
that but that doesn't automatically

1883.31 --> 1889.04
imply that they're all doing dark [Â __Â ]

1885.92 --> 1892.0600000000002
all of the time it's mostly just being

1889.04 --> 1892.06
sneaky I think

1893.09 --> 1896.1999999999998
[Music]

1901.71 --> 1910.22
yeah don't do that AGM I don't like that

1905.22 --> 1912.84
kind of pulling leg it's not funny

1910.22 --> 1921.48
especially when you go caps so just

1912.84 --> 1923.49
don't know you did it Jim playing that

1921.48 --> 1928.02
they were doing kind of witchcraft and

1923.49 --> 1930.68
[Â __Â ] behind the walls you don't know you

1928.02 --> 1933.789
don't know what they're doing

[Music]

1951.64 --> 1954.64
yeah

1986.36 --> 1994.55
you know what a gem okay I'm gonna put

1991.88 --> 1998.48
this one step forward have you ever

1994.55 --> 2006.55
walked into a lodge and actually asked

1998.48 --> 2010.99
them like do you actually practice

2006.55 --> 2018.55
witchcraft and what does that entail if

2010.99 --> 2022.06
so it's not illegal I think it depends

2018.55 --> 2025.18
well no generally so

2022.06 --> 2025.1799999999998
[Music]

2029.86 --> 2036.84
[Music]

2043.64 --> 2052.5
yeah backtracking backtracking fine stop

2049.38 --> 2055.52
talking about it then yeah don't even

2052.5 --> 2055.52
know how we got there

2071.31 --> 2077.79
it's a secret Tom Parker I I wasn't

2075.12 --> 2081.24
suggesting to go into a lodge and then

2077.79 --> 2082.83
ask them for their secrets I just asked

2081.24 --> 2086.3599999999997
them like do you crack

2082.83 --> 2086.36
do you practice witchcraft

2110.44 --> 2117.54
really Sanford huh this interesting

2114.85 --> 2117.54
perspective

2125.98 --> 2134.109
there's something to that like the whole

2130.75 --> 2136.03
peer pressure based system and give an

2134.109 --> 2138.46
example as to this makes you

2136.03 --> 2141.25
intellectually smart and right and you

2138.46 --> 2142.93
can win with that on many fronts and the

2141.25 --> 2145.329
other one makes you stupid and then

2142.93 --> 2147.0099999999998
you're always wrong so in a way yeah if

2145.329 --> 2150.329
you get confronted with that and then

2147.01 --> 2153.579
conditioned with that then you're taught

2150.329 --> 2156.19
like yeah spell-casting anyway like

2153.579 --> 2159.9100000000003
wizardry and you probably don't even

2156.19 --> 2163.48
realize it but that mechanism will have

2159.91 --> 2167.79
been learned and probably become part of

2163.48 --> 2167.79
your interactions with other people

2179.33 --> 2188.71
hmm Robin Stanley okay makes sense my

2186.02 --> 2191.48
friend that I went out with yesterday in

2188.71 --> 2196.73
Rotterdam is also a librarian and yeah

2191.48 --> 2198.98
she had some pretty freaky people start

2196.73 --> 2205.67
conversations with her as well it would

2198.98 --> 2208.94
be very careful but you do sometimes

2205.67 --> 2217.07
bump into pretty odd individuals at

2208.94 --> 2222.46
libraries well Matt lingard that depends

2217.07 --> 2222.46
on what you define as witches you know

2223.33 --> 2227.56
there's a lot of angles to it

2261.1 --> 2265.6
Shh

2263.08 --> 2273.1
well Matt lingard I've experienced some

2265.6 --> 2276.19
pretty weird [Â __Â ] like what I thought

2273.1 --> 2279.8199999999997
was like pretty impressive magic stuff

2276.19 --> 2284.62
from the Jesuit guy but it's weird

2279.82 --> 2286.84
because yeah it sometimes it's hard to

2284.62 --> 2289.6
tell whether it is in the physical realm

2286.84 --> 2292.3
or not but he works with that I think

2289.6 --> 2298.36
it's it's very weird how that works so

2292.3 --> 2302.3500000000004
yeah there but like well there is like

2298.36 --> 2304.54
hypnotism and all that it's more basic

2302.35 --> 2306.52
social engineering techniques that is

2304.54 --> 2310.12
really really a lot of that is really

2306.52 --> 2312.64
spell alike like spell casting alike but

2310.12 --> 2315.0699999999997
never really witnessed like an entire

2312.64 --> 2318.79
crowd being put to sleep although for

2315.07 --> 2324.3700000000003
example that could happen in certain

2318.79 --> 2326.77
types of churches I've seen that that a

2324.37 --> 2328.45
preacher would go full-on energy and you

2326.77 --> 2331.56
would do something and literally the

2328.45 --> 2331.56
people would faint

2338.02 --> 2345.6
that seemed kind of like magic but it is

2341.8 --> 2348.88
seems to be more about just yeah energy

2345.6 --> 2353.31
density and social response Intermec in

2348.88 --> 2353.31
it I don't know it is complicated thing

2374.52 --> 2377.21
right

2390.02 --> 2398.46
well look the issue is again and this is

2395.79 --> 2404.87
very typical for this age that the

2398.46 --> 2409.86
concept of which has been re-engineered

2404.87 --> 2412.68
culturally yeah impregnated in ways so

2409.86 --> 2417.81
there is also like the superficial which

2412.68 --> 2420.99
idea the style and character type and

2417.81 --> 2424.11
and then there's the idea that who if

2420.99 --> 2426.2099999999996
you know a lot of things about nature

2424.11 --> 2427.86
and herbs and all that and how to heal

2426.21 --> 2430.95
then you could also be considered a

2427.86 --> 2432.69
witch yeah well is that you know I

2430.95 --> 2436.5
actually know a lot of people like that

2432.69 --> 2439.62
including myself in a way but does that

2436.5 --> 2442.59
really make me a witch so what is a

2439.62 --> 2444.96
witch is a witch a pagan somebody that

2442.59 --> 2448.32
follows the old like the old traditions

2444.96 --> 2454.07
what's left of them in a in a

2448.32 --> 2457.77
non-destructive way or yeah or do you go

2454.07 --> 2460.6800000000003
then say okay there's crazy people out

2457.77 --> 2463.02
there that have completely abandoned all

2460.68 --> 2465.72
sensibility and they're doing really

2463.02 --> 2467.43
sick stuff potentially or literally or

2465.72 --> 2469.5899999999997
they just may want to make other people

2467.43 --> 2473.8399999999997
believe that they're doing that to creep

2469.59 --> 2478.4700000000003
them out is that a witch or is that just

2473.84 --> 2481.05
satanic why would you call that a witch

2478.47 --> 2488.91
if it's just straight-out satanic see

2481.05 --> 2491.04
that's the issue it's become there's

2488.91 --> 2495.42
people out there that would typically

2491.04 --> 2497.82
identify themselves as a witch because

2495.42 --> 2501.15
they have certain sensitivities for

2497.82 --> 2504.9
example that that happened yesterday

2501.15 --> 2508.11
even and I remember it's just like but

2504.9 --> 2512.6600000000003
they don't see that as our I'm secret I

2508.11 --> 2512.6600000000003
have a lot of evil secrets and [Â __Â ]

2515.25 --> 2523.53
isn't all evil bad what this is hopeless

2532.12 --> 2537.69
Teresa what I call Fringe darkness

2534.58 --> 2537.69
that's an interesting approach

2552.67 --> 2556.6800000000003
huh yeah

2559.68 --> 2563.96
wow that's pretty serious Fyodor

2561.6 --> 2563.96
Dostoevsky

2570.1 --> 2575.5
but on the other hand there is something

2573.25 --> 2577.99
to it also it is always though edged

2575.5 --> 2579.4
sword with all that [Â __Â ] and that is

2577.99 --> 2582.25
that if you're going to show like these

2579.4 --> 2583.78
how to control situations and I don't

2582.25 --> 2586.27
mean for legal purposes because of

2583.78 --> 2591.9700000000003
course for legal purposes that yeah that

2586.27 --> 2594.97
should be accessible of course no matter

2591.97 --> 2597.24
what but as for publicly throwing it out

2594.97 --> 2600.04
there yeah it does have like a very

2597.24 --> 2602.4599999999996
people get all riled up something goes

2600.04 --> 2605.08
wrong and then they start to potentially

2602.46 --> 2611.28
get all riled up against police for

2605.08 --> 2611.2799999999997
example that's just not good so yeah

2635.17 --> 2638.17
hmm

2639.43 --> 2648.299
that's an interesting way of saying it

2641.5 --> 2648.299
out iemon like me a man like me hmm

2676.5 --> 2679.43
okay

2679.55 --> 2682.9190000000003
[Music]

2688.82 --> 2695.0800000000004
[Music]

2691.38 --> 2698.71
really it doesn't matter lingard what

2695.08 --> 2702.67
about the confirmed historical value

2698.71 --> 2706.3
about the Bible not as much a spiritual

2702.67 --> 2708.4300000000003
message which would be probably rejected

2706.3 --> 2711.51
by atheists but what about the

2708.43 --> 2716.19
historical value would that all just be

2711.51 --> 2716.19
thrown up as well

2719.89 --> 2725.009
oh my chat is frozen thanks for for

2722.68 --> 2725.009
telling me

2732.99 --> 2735.77
thank you

2749.93 --> 2759.5099999999998
yeah thanks for keeping track of that

2752.88 --> 2762.9
Jen as well like from my OBS interface I

2759.51 --> 2765.3900000000003
can barely even see I can route I can't

2762.9 --> 2769.02
read the chat in there so I'd have to

2765.39 --> 2770.94
switch to the YouTube to see what's down

2769.02 --> 2774.35
there but yeah then there's a serious

2770.94 --> 2774.35
video delay and it's kind of confusing

2790.55 --> 2803.32
hmm okay Matt lingard yeah that's

2795.47 --> 2807.14
interesting and when it concerns

2803.32 --> 2811.51
isolated actions moral actions I totally

2807.14 --> 2811.5099999999998
agree with you of course

2840.15 --> 2846.809
all right okay yeah between Tom Parker

2843.42 --> 2849.079
and Matlin garden mint lingard you're

2846.809 --> 2849.079
both

2853.02 --> 2860.52
like I wouldn't consider the Bible up

2856.13 --> 2865.92
completely 100% history but there is

2860.52 --> 2868.34
absolutely referenceable history so in

2865.92 --> 2871.29
that sense yeah since it does contain

2868.34 --> 2874.07
confirmed history you could consider it

2871.29 --> 2877.07
an historical book but it is not only

2874.07 --> 2877.07
history

2886.71 --> 2889.809
[Music]

2897.8 --> 2904.46
yeah indeed Tom Parker oh that's funny

2902.3 --> 2912.11
you bring that up because World War one

2904.46 --> 2914.63
was seems to be very bizarre like it was

2912.11 --> 2917.1800000000003
a the more I think about it it seems

2914.63 --> 2923.42
literally like a war for no reason a

2917.18 --> 2926.72
made-up story context kind of like what

2923.42 --> 2930.23
probably happened during medieval times

2926.72 --> 2932.9599999999996
and Renaissance even is just like groups

2930.23 --> 2936.2
are getting propaganda whatever works

2932.96 --> 2940.01
from their leaders towns Criers and all

2936.2 --> 2942.9199999999996
that the soldiers get informed and then

2940.01 --> 2945.5
they just think they're doing it for a

2942.92 --> 2947.69
really good reason and then they do that

2945.5 --> 2950.03
and that used to work and that would

2947.69 --> 2951.92
make soldiers proud and all that and

2950.03 --> 2958.2200000000003
they'd fight for their Lord and their

2951.92 --> 2963.01
land and they kind of re-engineered that

2958.22 --> 2967.8199999999997
concept I think with World War one and

2963.01 --> 2971.3300000000004
into like a mega war but but almost like

2967.82 --> 2973.9100000000003
a giant play because how does that it

2971.33 --> 2977.93
makes a very little sense the way it all

2973.91 --> 2981.1099999999997
worked and of course yeah it was all

2977.93 --> 2984.2599999999998
created by a giant amount of finance

2981.11 --> 2988.31
because nobody would just muster such

2984.26 --> 2990.34
kind of war things out of nothing nobody

2988.31 --> 2993.98
would pay for that [Â __Â ] no it was all

2990.34 --> 2997.15
giant finance game it was a war game

2993.98 --> 2997.15
paid for

3001.63 --> 3004.8
[Music]

3008.7 --> 3015.7799999999997
yeah one could even consider that World

3011.73 --> 3018.049
War one might have been the first and

3015.78 --> 3021.4500000000003
probably one of the biggest social

3018.049 --> 3026.4
worldwide social engineering programs

3021.45 --> 3033.799
ever unleashed on world society by

3026.4 --> 3033.799
elitists by giant finance in the shadows

3039.619 --> 3045.5
maybe Brenda but not now the show is

3042.69 --> 3045.5
almost over

3054.74 --> 3061.75
[Music]

3067.8 --> 3072.239
[Music]

3096.72 --> 3101.25
or why

3105.28 --> 3109.6800000000003
yeah I know I turned my audio off for a

3107.35 --> 3109.68
second

3127.37 --> 3132.94
now Matt lingard sorry but PI is deduced

3152.48 --> 3157.42
that's the funny thing about math

3154.25 --> 3160.75
overall math doesn't measure things math

3157.42 --> 3160.75
deduces things

3173.92 --> 3180.6800000000003
yeah you know what the difference

3176.029 --> 3183.19
between pi and pi is real pi you can

3180.68 --> 3186.95
bake in the oven finish it and eat it

3183.19 --> 3189.289
the actual PI literally takes forever to

3186.95 --> 3191.74
calculate so you can't ever finish that

3189.289 --> 3191.7400000000002
pie

3244.17 --> 3250.34
no you don't know how to do that man

3247.02 --> 3254.64
leaning art that seems so sad

3250.34 --> 3256.02
it's the easiest thing in the world to

3254.64 --> 3259.4
get the circumference of a circle

3256.02 --> 3263.7
without calculus you know what you do

3259.4 --> 3264.54
has to be solid though if it solid if

3263.7 --> 3269.2799999999997
it's physical

3264.54 --> 3275.34
then you take piece of string take it

3269.28 --> 3277.77
around close it up and yeah then you

3275.34 --> 3281.76
measure how long that string is you

3277.77 --> 3285.05
don't need any PI number for that now

3281.76 --> 3285.05
that's actual measuring

3290.74 --> 3293.77
[Music]

3299.66 --> 3308.87
Oh roll it next to a tape measure can

3305.51 --> 3311.0
also work but then you have to have a

3308.87 --> 3313.1
specific tape measuring device the funny

3311.0 --> 3316.37
thing is you don't even need that you

3313.1 --> 3316.79
just need a piece of string and get its

3316.37 --> 3318.98
length

3316.79 --> 3324.1
it's and then afterwards yeah I didn't

3318.98 --> 3324.1
you can put your ruler next to that

3325.69 --> 3331.43
anyway it's yeah pie it's all really

3329.03 --> 3336.5
funny and all mathematically interesting

3331.43 --> 3339.43
and it's not entirely irrational it's

3336.5 --> 3339.43
just math

3346.56 --> 3352.88
yeah yeah the chat is pretty interesting

3350.49 --> 3352.8799999999997
today

3397.48 --> 3407.829
alright well YouTube YouTube look the

3404.589 --> 3412.63
whole feet thing that was established

3407.829 --> 3415.42
look it was in a time when I guess we're

3412.63 --> 3424.3900000000003
sizing up lengths wasn't all that

3415.42 --> 3428.56
critical I think although yeah that for

3424.39 --> 3431.5
somebody that would actually be the

3428.56 --> 3432.849
architect for for buildings even basic

3431.5 --> 3435.0
buildings then it would be kind of

3432.849 --> 3437.65
necessary to get all the lengths exact

3435.0 --> 3440.68
but I guess that you could then just

3437.65 --> 3443.4100000000003
that it was presumed that okay so if

3440.68 --> 3446.02
somebody's gonna make something based on

3443.41 --> 3450.5699999999997
feet their cousin just gonna huge their

3446.02 --> 3453.97
own foot as the scale ruler for that and

3450.57 --> 3455.71
then yeah it would kind of fit and yeah

3453.97 --> 3458.74
depending on how big the guy's foot

3455.71 --> 3460.599
would be then the size of the building

3458.74 --> 3466.839
or whatever would be a bit bigger I

3460.599 --> 3471.339
don't know maybe that I don't know it's

3466.839 --> 3475.65
kind of silly the Kings foot length okay

3471.339 --> 3477.94
that yeah that's funny

3475.65 --> 3480.4
did that really happen that way

3477.94 --> 3485.98
that the king just say okay the measure

3480.4 --> 3491.609
shell of the length shall be based on my

3485.98 --> 3491.609
thoughts why not

3498.07 --> 3502.9500000000003
hmmm I didn't even know that makes sense

3500.71 --> 3502.95
though

3509.859 --> 3516.459
hmm anyway guys and gals I'm gonna round
