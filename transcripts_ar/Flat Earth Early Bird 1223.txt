weather today is

98.96 --> 101.83999999999999
quite beautiful

106.36 --> 110.479
[Music]

107.6 --> 114.19999999999999
pretty clear skied

110.479 --> 114.2
oh look there's a

114.32 --> 119.03999999999999
plane

115.36 --> 119.04
personal plane flying over there

126.479 --> 131.76
yeah it's really nice clear sky

129.92 --> 135.44
there doesn't seem to be any oh there's

131.76 --> 138.0
another one wow i think it's like

135.44 --> 140.959
like personal airplane flying day out

138.0 --> 144.0
there because i'm seeing multiple

140.959 --> 148.16
personal planes flying

144.0 --> 148.16
but i don't think the cam can pick it up

149.84 --> 154.64000000000001
but yeah it's clear

152.16 --> 157.84
there's a couple of clouds but

154.64 --> 159.35999999999999
really not that significant

157.84 --> 163.12
very sunny

159.36 --> 163.12
but it's also very windy

164.08 --> 168.64000000000001
and it's a nice type of wind it feels

166.56 --> 169.84
like the winds coming from the sea or

168.64 --> 171.11999999999998
something

169.84 --> 173.68
that smell

171.12 --> 176.4
to it it's very nice it's a really nice

173.68 --> 176.4
day out there

182.959 --> 185.84
all right

193.599 --> 196.599
hmm

200.8 --> 205.72
nobody's there yet

202.56 --> 205.72
all right

212.56 --> 217.36
maybe people went out and partied

215.2 --> 220.39999999999998
yesterday wouldn't be surprised

217.36 --> 224.519
friday there was already a bit the case

220.4 --> 224.519
seems to be hanging in the air

226.08 --> 232.31900000000002
myself did not

229.04 --> 232.319
go to bed that late

232.879 --> 237.439
right anyway it is

235.04 --> 241.56
sunday the 24th

237.439 --> 241.56
of april 2022

244.959 --> 250.08
yeah

246.159 --> 250.07999999999998
had a pretty good night rest but

250.48 --> 255.11999999999998
i had a really big dinner for my doing

253.12 --> 257.04
like basically one and a half times what

255.12 --> 258.32
i normally eat and it was like really

257.04 --> 262.40000000000003
stuffed

258.32 --> 264.71999999999997
and i still feel really stuffed from it

262.4 --> 268.12
even though it's been like

264.72 --> 268.12
what is it

270.24 --> 273.93
like 14

272.639 --> 276.0
hours ago

273.93 --> 279.52
[Music]

276.0 --> 279.52
but yeah i felt i needed that

281.199 --> 283.84000000000003
oh

289.28 --> 295.03999999999996
thanks probably regenerating because

292.08 --> 296.639
yeah things are regenerating with my jaw

295.04 --> 299.52000000000004
significantly

296.639 --> 302.24
like a lot of the the yeah the fleshy

299.52 --> 304.15999999999997
bulge side effects from the

302.24 --> 305.6
inflammation

304.16 --> 310.28000000000003
period

305.6 --> 310.28000000000003
is already receding pretty dramatically

310.32 --> 315.199
so i think i'm like

311.919 --> 316.96
regenerating i feel very good

315.199 --> 319.199
like have this weird

316.96 --> 321.44
youngness feeling

319.199 --> 323.28000000000003
weird youngness yeah now i normally i

321.44 --> 324.96
always have that but it's like an extra

323.28 --> 327.039
bit

324.96 --> 328.08
and that i know

327.039 --> 330.639
that

328.08 --> 331.84
because it's very good for personal

330.639 --> 334.40000000000003
morale

331.84 --> 338.0
like it's very encouraging to feel that

334.4 --> 341.12
and it helps regenerating so

338.0 --> 343.759
did it arrive in response to

341.12 --> 345.44
the disease cycle or was it always going

343.759 --> 347.199
to be there and it's just really

345.44 --> 349.6
convenient

347.199 --> 352.24
because it's spring and i do typically

349.6 --> 354.16
get jaw issues in the spring so it's

352.24 --> 356.88
just like

354.16 --> 356.88000000000005
what is this

357.68 --> 362.40000000000003
these are the type of things i wonder

359.52 --> 364.0
about sometimes

362.4 --> 366.479
i wonder about a lot of things and

364.0 --> 369.039
mechanisms like which one is actually

366.479 --> 369.039
the cause

369.199 --> 373.44
because it's much easier in your mind to

371.36 --> 376.24
kind of like turn it around

373.44 --> 376.24
and fixate

377.36 --> 381.28000000000003
with the turnaround view like you think

379.52 --> 383.19899999999996
this is causing that but it's actually

381.28 --> 385.75899999999996
the other way around like it is there

383.199 --> 385.759
because

386.0 --> 388.88
there's a need

389.84 --> 394.56
yeah anyway hello michael khan first in

393.28 --> 395.75899999999996
chat

394.56 --> 398.8
brand m

395.759 --> 401.68
good to see you jeff gas head

398.8 --> 401.68
mike sidunich

402.0 --> 405.639
how are you all doing

423.84 --> 427.79999999999995
what was i doing yesterday

436.479 --> 440.599
there are quite a few videos

452.319 --> 454.96000000000004
let's see

457.84 --> 462.0
yeah no stream from jim bob but he had a

460.16 --> 464.72
couple of uploads

462.0 --> 468.28
funny little videos

464.72 --> 468.28000000000003
that's pretty cool

481.039 --> 485.36
oh yeah david weiss

483.44 --> 487.52
i thought he was like he had uploaded

485.36 --> 489.84000000000003
like the movie the next level but it

487.52 --> 493.479
wasn't

489.84 --> 493.479
it's just a trailer

496.0 --> 498.319
uh

500.879 --> 506.68
all right now i'm kind of puzzled what

502.4 --> 506.67999999999995
was i doing yesterday night

508.16 --> 511.56
wasn't watching

524.64 --> 529.36
just going to look at my history

526.959 --> 529.3599999999999
to see

530.959 --> 535.68
oh yeah i know i remember and no one

533.44 --> 537.839
know why it's so fuzzy i was basically

535.68 --> 540.0
watching back my own shows i watched

537.839 --> 542.8800000000001
yesterday's show back

540.0 --> 545.6
but before that i watched the show from

542.88 --> 547.68
friday back

545.6 --> 550.08
just oh yeah and i sent seeking star

547.68 --> 553.7199999999999
wars hello i sent you an email

550.08 --> 553.72
about my address

562.88 --> 567.4399999999999
all right cool

564.48 --> 570.44
oh yeah i hadn't checked my email yet

567.44 --> 570.44
will

579.36 --> 584.9590000000001
oh

581.279 --> 584.959
oh that looks very nice

586.24 --> 589.24
wow

596.56 --> 602.079
i'm looking forward to having that i

599.519 --> 604.48
really i want to thank you a lot

602.079 --> 606.64
seeking star wars for just for just

604.48 --> 609.04
giving that to me i really appreciate

606.64 --> 610.56
that i will if with your permission show

609.04 --> 613.1999999999999
them off

610.56 --> 613.1999999999999
on the show

616.0 --> 620.32
or yeah you could come on like if i if i

618.8 --> 623.1999999999999
get him

620.32 --> 625.36
we could do a show together

623.2 --> 627.279
and like talk about it and then i'll

625.36 --> 629.519
have like the example right here in

627.279 --> 630.959
front of me

629.519 --> 634.32
what do you say

630.959 --> 634.3199999999999
would you be ready for that

637.76 --> 641.4399999999999
i mean it's not super urgent or anything

640.079 --> 643.12
but it's just

641.44 --> 646.44
thing i think that would make a pretty

643.12 --> 646.44
cool show

646.88 --> 649.04
all right

648.0 --> 652.839
cool

649.04 --> 652.8389999999999
looking forward to that

666.399 --> 670.959
anyway yeah i spent a lot of time

668.32 --> 673.839
yesterday watching back my shows which

670.959 --> 678.0
like together is

673.839 --> 678.0
like four and a half hours or something

679.44 --> 684.9590000000001
i mean friday show was pretty long and

682.88 --> 687.12
yesterday's show was also

684.959 --> 689.8389999999999
like really long was it two hours and 20

687.12 --> 689.839
minutes plus

691.44 --> 698.32
but yeah i was really

694.0 --> 698.32
satisfied and it's it's funny because

698.72 --> 702.5600000000001
i kind of thought that things were going

700.88 --> 705.36
all right for a while

702.56 --> 707.92
but it's like really good now it's weird

705.36 --> 711.44
to say that but like compared to some of

707.92 --> 712.88
the times like a year ago

711.44 --> 714.5600000000001
i had like

712.88 --> 716.8
pretty good moments still like i've

714.56 --> 718.2399999999999
always had those but then

716.8 --> 720.88
like quickly

718.24 --> 723.6
usually followed up by

720.88 --> 726.959
like chaos or confusion or some kind of

723.6 --> 731.839
fears seeping in in some way

726.959 --> 731.8389999999999
but that like it's not happening now

733.519 --> 740.399
i really feel i got it under control

736.56 --> 742.88
i wonder how long i can hold on to this

740.399 --> 745.519
it might simply be until

742.88 --> 747.12
like the the definite end of summer or

745.519 --> 750.88
something

747.12 --> 754.32
but yeah that's like almost half a year

750.88 --> 754.32
so yeah i'm looking forward

757.279 --> 761.12
if it's going to be this beautiful like

759.36 --> 764.12
the entire summer i'm going to be very

761.12 --> 764.12
happy

765.53 --> 768.6899999999999
[Music]

794.959 --> 799.92
right so yeah i don't really have a lot

797.44 --> 803.12
to like reflect upon right now like i

799.92 --> 803.12
was kind of watching a

803.519 --> 806.9590000000001
sort of a documentary

810.0 --> 814.519
that i bumped into on infowars

821.839 --> 825.2790000000001
i think i'll share that

826.639 --> 830.9590000000001
it's it's pretty it's it's pretty

828.72 --> 832.48
interesting it's not perfect

830.959 --> 834.14
but

832.48 --> 837.49
yeah

834.14 --> 837.49
[Music]

840.399 --> 846.48
i mean don't like hang all your weight

843.519 --> 847.92
on this or something but like i think

846.48 --> 850.9590000000001
that it'll

847.92 --> 853.199
stand the test of time pretty well

850.959 --> 854.8
and like i didn't come across anything

853.199 --> 856.88
in there that it was like

854.8 --> 858.56
like well that that is very wrong

856.88 --> 860.959
there's something really wrong here no

858.56 --> 863.5999999999999
no no

860.959 --> 864.6389999999999
i mean there was references to world war

863.6 --> 865.44
ii

864.639 --> 867.76
and

865.44 --> 869.36
like the rollerblading incident 6

867.76 --> 872.3199999999999
million right

869.36 --> 874.48
that's like the only real flag i even

872.32 --> 877.36
heard in there that was like oh god here

874.48 --> 880.16
we go again but

877.36 --> 883.12
the rest was just all very clear and

880.16 --> 887.36
like what i would roughly associate with

883.12 --> 889.92
90s bbc documentary quality

887.36 --> 893.6
it's like a historical

889.92 --> 895.36
researcher basically laying down

893.6 --> 898.639
what is happening in

895.36 --> 901.92
in the ukraine war right now and like

898.639 --> 904.8
with pretty detailed research so it's

901.92 --> 904.8
worth watching

909.839 --> 912.839
right

924.56 --> 927.5999999999999
yeah other than that just reflecting

926.72 --> 930.0
upon

927.6 --> 935.0790000000001
spirit mechanics i'm like enveloped in

930.0 --> 935.079
spirit mechanics pretty constantly now

943.199 --> 947.7589999999999
it's crazy it's like i got this fractal

946.24 --> 951.519
lens

947.759 --> 953.759
right almost like a a gem of true seeing

951.519 --> 955.92
what it would be called in d d

953.759 --> 957.6
terminology which are very precious it's

955.92 --> 960.0
funny because in like the dungeons and

957.6 --> 961.6
dragons movie the second one which is an

960.0 --> 963.92
awesome movie

961.6 --> 965.12
unlike the first one which was extremely

963.92 --> 966.8
annoying

965.12 --> 968.8
and ugly

966.8 --> 970.959
although it had a hilarious villain in

968.8 --> 970.959
it

971.04 --> 975.519
the second one there is like this rogue

973.04 --> 979.4399999999999
and he has a gem of true seeing well to

975.519 --> 982.079
me it's like i have a gem of true seeing

979.44 --> 984.8800000000001
and i'm like whatever i'm doing i'm just

982.079 --> 986.3199999999999
constantly looking through that thing

984.88 --> 989.279
now

986.32 --> 992.48
and realizing like just seeing how every

989.279 --> 994.48
pattern connects like

992.48 --> 996.5600000000001
it's almost like i'm looking at things

994.48 --> 999.44
on an ethereal level

996.56 --> 1002.6389999999999
and just see people's intention and

999.44 --> 1005.36
their will and their impulses

1002.639 --> 1007.519
like virtually represented and how

1005.36 --> 1009.6
everything that happens

1007.519 --> 1010.5600000000001
connects to them and how they then resp

1009.6 --> 1012.8000000000001
it's

1010.56 --> 1015.4399999999999
it gets pretty intense

1012.8 --> 1017.7589999999999
sometimes like

1015.44 --> 1021.0400000000001
what yeah my internal processes like

1017.759 --> 1021.04
that analytically

1022.8 --> 1028.559
yeah and it's it's it's pretty cool too

1025.52 --> 1031.52
because when i was like

1028.559 --> 1032.8799999999999
15 to 25

1031.52 --> 1034.8799999999999
it was

1032.88 --> 1036.5590000000002
incredibly strong too

1034.88 --> 1037.6000000000001
but

1036.559 --> 1039.28
again

1037.6 --> 1041.839
i did not

1039.28 --> 1044.0
know what i was seeing i could see it in

1041.839 --> 1045.4389999999999
every detail but i did not have the

1044.0 --> 1048.4
reflective

1045.439 --> 1051.76
reflective context as much

1048.4 --> 1053.6000000000001
right so a lot of it was wasted on me

1051.76 --> 1056.4
back then

1053.6 --> 1059.84
and i knew that it was very aggravating

1056.4 --> 1062.0
i'm like i'm seeing gold everywhere but

1059.84 --> 1064.24
i can't grab it

1062.0 --> 1065.52
and it's really frustrating that that's

1064.24 --> 1068.4
like

1065.52 --> 1070.32
what's happening to me a lot in my youth

1068.4 --> 1073.2800000000002
like just seeing this

1070.32 --> 1075.84
incredible potential and just not

1073.28 --> 1078.6399999999999
like knowing that it's there know that

1075.84 --> 1081.52
it is going to have complexity and like

1078.64 --> 1083.2
glory that could come out of it i just

1081.52 --> 1084.8799999999999
couldn't grab it

1083.2 --> 1087.44
now i'm

1084.88 --> 1090.0800000000002
able to grab things a lot in a lot more

1087.44 --> 1093.72
detail if so much more to reflect upon

1090.08 --> 1093.72
if so much more

1094.799 --> 1100.32
my own personal personal akashic

1097.84 --> 1100.32
record

1101.039 --> 1105.84
to reflect upon and now

1103.679 --> 1108.96
the patterns like have come back like

1105.84 --> 1110.3999999999999
the demoralization cycle of all that has

1108.96 --> 1113.2
ended

1110.4 --> 1116.24
helplessness into a position where i am

1113.2 --> 1118.88
not really helpless anymore

1116.24 --> 1122.76
and i still have that power apparently

1118.88 --> 1122.7600000000002
it's still to that level

1124.72 --> 1129.2
a bit less pushy

1126.559 --> 1131.6
can you imagine

1129.2 --> 1132.64
more pushy yeah

1131.6 --> 1134.559
i was like

1132.64 --> 1137.5200000000002
yeah

1134.559 --> 1137.52
a bit of mania

1143.76 --> 1149.559
anyway i'm just rambling on about myself

1146.559 --> 1149.559
now

1150.799 --> 1156.32
but yeah to me being me is pretty

1153.679 --> 1156.3200000000002
interesting

1157.2 --> 1160.799
i almost try to avoid

1161.52 --> 1165.36
rolling into complicated situations

1163.919 --> 1167.919
because that would be

1165.36 --> 1170.9599999999998
would too be so interesting and then i'd

1167.919 --> 1170.96
get overwhelmed

1171.679 --> 1173.919
right

1177.28 --> 1181.52
button i got my eye on

1182.48 --> 1186.96
on just like

1183.84 --> 1189.4399999999998
yeah on this media thing

1186.96 --> 1191.28
not the mainstream media although

1189.44 --> 1194.3200000000002
remote eye

1191.28 --> 1196.96
but on like people and how do they react

1194.32 --> 1196.96
how do they

1197.679 --> 1201.919
grow

1200.0 --> 1204.24
in response to

1201.919 --> 1207.1200000000001
the situation

1204.24 --> 1209.52
and how they figure out how to basically

1207.12 --> 1211.6
maneuver through it

1209.52 --> 1213.76
i've been studying it for a long time

1211.6 --> 1216.1589999999999
and there's just a lot more people now

1213.76 --> 1218.64
on a high level doing that

1216.159 --> 1221.8400000000001
just very stimulating

1218.64 --> 1225.039
really gets me like yeah yeah yeah

1221.84 --> 1228.799
like let's go let's go are we ready yet

1225.039 --> 1228.799
are we ready yet guys

1229.679 --> 1232.679
ah

1245.2 --> 1251.64
hello pjs cnet good to see you

1248.53 --> 1251.6399999999999
[Music]

1288.88 --> 1293.5200000000002
right so yeah

1290.96 --> 1295.3600000000001
what do you want me to talk about

1293.52 --> 1297.679
what would you like me to analyze what

1295.36 --> 1300.3999999999999
would you like me to describe

1297.679 --> 1303.72
what would you like me to judge

1300.4 --> 1303.72
i'm here

1306.32 --> 1311.039
i mean you could almost at this point

1308.4 --> 1312.96
just regard me you guys in chat you get

1311.039 --> 1315.679
that

1312.96 --> 1317.3600000000001
like with me it's like you're doing

1315.679 --> 1320.0
tarot except

1317.36 --> 1322.4799999999998
i don't do it with cards you just say

1320.0 --> 1322.48
something

1324.0 --> 1328.48
you just say something that's actually

1326.72 --> 1330.559
worth investigating

1328.48 --> 1333.6
and or pondering upon

1330.559 --> 1336.3999999999999
and then i just unroll it

1333.6 --> 1339.36
i like divine

1336.4 --> 1339.3600000000001
the idea

1342.37 --> 1347.1589999999999
[Music]

1343.44 --> 1347.159
so bring it on

1351.59 --> 1355.01
[Music]

1379.039 --> 1383.44
or just

1380.32 --> 1386.08
like lay back and chill

1383.44 --> 1389.76
or be really busy with work because i

1386.08 --> 1393.76
inspired it again for some reason

1389.76 --> 1393.76
85 percent dark what

1401.679 --> 1406.64
i thought it was a lot more than that

1403.919 --> 1409.8400000000001
but yeah dark matter

1406.64 --> 1412.88
oh that dark matter

1409.84 --> 1414.84
like if only they could just

1412.88 --> 1418.48
figure out a

1414.84 --> 1421.1999999999998
balanced networkable formula for gravity

1418.48 --> 1423.1200000000001
right now all they got is newton

1421.2 --> 1425.039
and it's even not official anymore but

1423.12 --> 1428.6399999999999
yeah einstein gravity doesn't work you

1425.039 --> 1430.24
can't make a a web a network like model

1428.64 --> 1432.4
or gravity with that because you can

1430.24 --> 1434.4
only ever calculate

1432.4 --> 1437.8400000000001
anything

1434.4 --> 1440.0800000000002
from a yeah one point of attraction one

1437.84 --> 1442.1589999999999
body of attraction that's the only way

1440.08 --> 1443.76
einstein gravity works

1442.159 --> 1446.48
you can't

1443.76 --> 1448.24
then calculate everything separately and

1446.48 --> 1449.3600000000001
put it together

1448.24 --> 1451.52
because it's

1449.36 --> 1454.9599999999998
it's not compatible

1451.52 --> 1457.039
right newton's model was so useful

1454.96 --> 1460.72
because you could have as many sources

1457.039 --> 1462.72
of gravity as you wanted to conjure up

1460.72 --> 1464.48
right it was very dynamic it was

1462.72 --> 1467.1200000000001
networkable

1464.48 --> 1470.0
but then of course like the whole

1467.12 --> 1472.1589999999999
balancing out of the math problem came

1470.0 --> 1474.48
into being with the conception of that

1472.159 --> 1476.88
bloated galaxy idea

1474.48 --> 1478.64
and that's why they created dark matter

1476.88 --> 1481.279
like uh

1478.64 --> 1484.24
yeah that's like it won't last it's

1481.279 --> 1487.039
going to rip itself apart so dark matter

1484.24 --> 1490.24
had to be conjured up

1487.039 --> 1492.48
to balance out the math

1490.24 --> 1496.84
that's why there is this fictional

1492.48 --> 1496.84
immeasurable unobservable

1496.88 --> 1501.5200000000002
substance

1499.12 --> 1504.6399999999999
called dark matter

1501.52 --> 1506.6399999999999
it's because of newtonian dependency

1504.64 --> 1508.88
with the in the conjuration of the

1506.64 --> 1511.6000000000001
heliocentric model

1508.88 --> 1515.5590000000002
that's what it is dark matter is based

1511.6 --> 1515.559
on newtonian dependency

1520.32 --> 1524.0
all relative yeah well with einstein

1522.159 --> 1526.24
gravity

1524.0 --> 1530.0
yeah it is all relative but the thing is

1526.24 --> 1531.84
you can't make a mesh model with that

1530.0 --> 1534.48
then

1531.84 --> 1536.9599999999998
you can't just put it together and then

1534.48 --> 1539.279
just like inter-calculate how is it

1536.96 --> 1541.3600000000001
going to maneuver you can't do anything

1539.279 --> 1544.24
with einstein gravity

1541.36 --> 1546.32
you can only isolate a thing

1544.24 --> 1548.0
then calculate the gravity about that

1546.32 --> 1550.72
situation

1548.0 --> 1553.52
but you can't just like makes

1550.72 --> 1556.72
multiple einstein gravity calculations

1553.52 --> 1558.6399999999999
about things and then put it together

1556.72 --> 1560.32
because

1558.64 --> 1563.279
yeah

1560.32 --> 1565.84
it's not compatible like one

1563.279 --> 1568.32
calculation will not be able to give

1565.84 --> 1570.9599999999998
recognition to another

1568.32 --> 1573.36
when you put it together because

1570.96 --> 1575.679
it doesn't work that way and newton's

1573.36 --> 1577.9189999999999
model did

1575.679 --> 1577.919
see

1578.32 --> 1583.039
very yeah it's it's cool

1580.96 --> 1585.1200000000001
i mean to me it's cool i

1583.039 --> 1589.279
figured that out

1585.12 --> 1589.279
the details of how that was designed

1590.08 --> 1593.1999999999998
i was surprised that

1593.919 --> 1599.279
yeah that nathan i told it

1596.799 --> 1601.2
i was talking about that like two weeks

1599.279 --> 1604.48
ago on fed or something

1601.2 --> 1605.52
and newton didn't even realize i mean

1604.48 --> 1607.44
nathan

1605.52 --> 1610.96
didn't even realize it

1607.44 --> 1612.96
as he said in response to that

1610.96 --> 1616.4
but yeah it is

1612.96 --> 1616.4
newtonian dependency

1617.2 --> 1620.799
because

1618.559 --> 1624.559
newton's model is the only thing

1620.799 --> 1627.799
that allows a wep formation

1624.559 --> 1627.799
with gravity

1633.36 --> 1637.7199999999998
all these conceptual problems

1640.0 --> 1643.279
right so thank you for that seeking star

1641.84 --> 1647.0
water

1643.279 --> 1647.0
see it's that simple

1654.08 --> 1659.6789999999999
just say something interesting and i

1656.32 --> 1663.96
respond with like a three to four minute

1659.679 --> 1663.96
detailed rant about it

1673.919 --> 1676.0800000000002
right

1674.96 --> 1680.32
words

1676.08 --> 1683.72
in themselves are my tarot deck

1680.32 --> 1683.72
all of it

1690.3 --> 1693.52
[Music]

1698.36 --> 1704.99
[Music]

1705.919 --> 1709.2
where's everybody else at

1709.36 --> 1714.0

all right michael khan's making dinner

1731.36 --> 1734.08
wait dinner

1737.84 --> 1744.1589999999999
oh wait michael khan is like

1741.2 --> 1746.96
from australia or something right

1744.159 --> 1746.96
that makes sense

1747.6 --> 1751.9599999999998
hey adam price good to see you

all right anyway i got some grapefruit

1836.88 --> 1841.64
juice here

1838.64 --> 1841.64
hmm

1871.519 --> 1874.96
a man like me

1875.6 --> 1880.559
nathan 24 7. what

1885.76 --> 1889.559
you mean nathan oakley

1893.44 --> 1898.039
hmm no i did not hear that

1908.0 --> 1912.159
huh

1910.159 --> 1915.519
has he ever come on

1912.159 --> 1915.519
24 7 discord

1917.36 --> 1921.84
all right

1918.559 --> 1921.84
pretty cool i guess

1934.399 --> 1936.6399999999999
hmm

1944.0 --> 1947.0
right

1947.97 --> 1950.24
[Music]

1949.12 --> 1951.29
anyway

1950.24 --> 1953.1200000000001
guys

1951.29 --> 1956.44
[Music]

1953.12 --> 1956.4399999999998
what's happening

1978.559 --> 1985.2
switch between 24 7 flat earth discord

1982.48 --> 1985.2
and then price

1985.679 --> 1989.3990000000001
i'll link you up

1990.64 --> 1997.2
it's kind of just a discord

1994.08 --> 1997.1999999999998
channel and they just talk

1998.32 --> 2002.36
but all kinds of stuff

2021.919 --> 2027.919
i wonder why they took the chat away

2024.88 --> 2031.519
i don't the chat was like

2027.919 --> 2034.159
it was bots only it's like not even

2031.519 --> 2036.72
anti-flat earthers were just being nags

2034.159 --> 2039.72
or anything no it was just bots just

2036.72 --> 2039.72
bots

2048.079 --> 2050.7200000000003
so yeah

2059.119 --> 2063.599
i mean maybe they could find another way

2061.2 --> 2066.0
to do it right maybe a members only

2063.599 --> 2068.56
system i think that would probably be

2066.0 --> 2070.879
pretty effective

2068.56 --> 2072.7999999999997
to do that like it's like okay you're

2070.879 --> 2076.48
either gonna have no chat or members

2072.8 --> 2078.48
only well like bots

2076.48 --> 2080.56
like oh really they're they're so

2078.48 --> 2082.879
desperate to use their bots that they'll

2080.56 --> 2085.839
actually get memberships

2082.879 --> 2089.679
for it well then at least you're getting

2085.839 --> 2091.52
paid it's like sort of like a troll ad

2089.679 --> 2094.7200000000003
you have to sit through the trolls but

2091.52 --> 2096.96
they do effectively pay you

2094.72 --> 2100.0
to sit through them

2096.96 --> 2100.0
right you could do that

2100.96 --> 2107.04
if you don't have any like 24 7

2104.56 --> 2110.92
youtube chat moderators

2107.04 --> 2110.92
and they don't seem to

2117.2 --> 2120.56
a few days from oh you just know about

2119.28 --> 2124.4
it okay

2120.56 --> 2124.4
yeah they've been around for a long time

2124.48 --> 2128.839
i've been like visiting there

2126.56 --> 2134.2799999999997
sporadically in the

2128.839 --> 2134.2799999999997
last three years at least

2145.839 --> 2148.96
but yeah there's some really cool guys

2147.599 --> 2150.88
on there

2148.96 --> 2152.88
that are also just really good

2150.88 --> 2156.56
conversationalists

2152.88 --> 2156.56
there's people in there that are like

2156.72 --> 2163.04
you say that excellent betas

2160.0 --> 2164.88
like excellent ones then they've they've

2163.04 --> 2166.48
been they've been popping up in general

2164.88 --> 2167.839
like there are people that are really

2166.48 --> 2169.76
good

2167.839 --> 2171.92
it's like this interview mode is they

2169.76 --> 2174.32
know somebody has an expertise they're

2171.92 --> 2178.2400000000002
very sensitive to that and then they

2174.32 --> 2180.6400000000003
know how to like unlock that

2178.24 --> 2183.359
and there's a couple of guys on 24 7

2180.64 --> 2187.0789999999997
discord that regularly visit there that

2183.359 --> 2187.0789999999997
are really good at that

2187.2 --> 2192.0789999999997
right

2188.56 --> 2195.52
it's funny because for example

2192.079 --> 2198.2400000000002
yeah another field that alex jones like

2195.52 --> 2200.56
he does calls and all that

2198.24 --> 2202.56
i'm pretty sure that they're the callers

2200.56 --> 2204.0789999999997
he takes nowadays they're like more like

2202.56 --> 2206.32
panelists

2204.079 --> 2209.04
and a lot of them i have that quality

2206.32 --> 2211.2000000000003
too like they really know how to like

2209.04 --> 2214.32
unlock people's doors

2211.2 --> 2215.7599999999998
like they know how to get alex inspired

2214.32 --> 2217.119
for example

2215.76 --> 2219.6800000000003
right

2217.119 --> 2220.96
and then it typically has those types of

2219.68 --> 2223.2799999999997
colors

2220.96 --> 2224.96
periodically like they not all of them

2223.28 --> 2227.3590000000004
are like that

2224.96 --> 2230.32
but they will pop in there

2227.359 --> 2232.0789999999997
because they really get him going

2230.32 --> 2233.839
and it's good it's like

2232.079 --> 2236.4
good to listen to

2233.839 --> 2238.64
and yeah over 24 7 there's guys like

2236.4 --> 2241.359
that too

2238.64 --> 2243.44
i think sometimes they do also visit

2241.359 --> 2247.52
like the live shows

2243.44 --> 2247.52
at nathan oakley's in discord

2249.44 --> 2252.44
anyway

2278.88 --> 2284.2000000000003
coherent sentence would be great a man

2280.96 --> 2284.2
like me

2288.0 --> 2290.32
all right

2295.359 --> 2299.5989999999997
all right so nathan went there you saw

2297.119 --> 2301.6800000000003
it cool

2299.599 --> 2303.04
i take it he was just talking about the

2301.68 --> 2305.2799999999997
usual

2303.04 --> 2307.92
maybe he was complaining a lot about

2305.28 --> 2309.3590000000004
flat earthers

2307.92 --> 2311.04
that

2309.359 --> 2312.96
have their own delusions i mean that's

2311.04 --> 2315.92
like a whole subject on its own and

2312.96 --> 2318.88
nathan does talk about that now

2315.92 --> 2318.88
more regularly

2320.16 --> 2323.52
and it's worth talking about

2325.119 --> 2329.52
right it's the pitfalls like oh oh you

2327.359 --> 2332.64
think you're a flat earther oh that

2329.52 --> 2332.64
means you're right

2333.2 --> 2339.1189999999997
let me trigger some people just like

2335.44 --> 2341.359
certain category of christians

2339.119 --> 2342.32
think like oh if you just believe this

2341.359 --> 2345.44
riddle

2342.32 --> 2346.56
then you're always good

2345.44 --> 2347.52
uh

2346.56 --> 2348.72
no

2347.52 --> 2350.72
[Music]

2348.72 --> 2352.9599999999996
and the same goes for flat earth it's

2350.72 --> 2355.1189999999997
just because you know the earth is flat

2352.96 --> 2357.52
like how do you know it

2355.119 --> 2359.76
do you actually know it or did you just

2357.52 --> 2361.599
choose the side that you thought was

2359.76 --> 2363.6800000000003
gonna win

2361.599 --> 2365.839
how much do you actually know does that

2363.68 --> 2369.44
mean that you now think you have the

2365.839 --> 2371.52
room to just declare certain things

2369.44 --> 2373.44
to be in a certain way

2371.52 --> 2374.4
because that's works like that in your

2373.44 --> 2376.16
model

2374.4 --> 2377.6800000000003
do you have any backing for that how

2376.16 --> 2378.96
honest are you going to be about are you

2377.68 --> 2382.3999999999996
just going to

2378.96 --> 2384.4
say it like oh of course it's this right

2382.4 --> 2387.119
yeah that might gaslight some people

2384.4 --> 2388.2400000000002
that will just take it

2387.119 --> 2389.76
but

2388.24 --> 2391.7599999999998
when they're tested

2389.76 --> 2394.079
they're just going to be made to look

2391.76 --> 2397.3590000000004
like fools

2394.079 --> 2399.04
you know it's not good so

2397.359 --> 2401.04
yeah just because you're a flat earther

2399.04 --> 2403.119
doesn't mean you could just

2401.04 --> 2405.839
start declaring things that you don't

2403.119 --> 2407.52
have proof for

2405.839 --> 2410.319
right

2407.52 --> 2412.64
i have a whole wide range of potential

2410.319 --> 2414.24
things that i think that the earth could

2412.64 --> 2416.4
turn out to be

2414.24 --> 2419.5989999999997
other than the geometric orientation of

2416.4 --> 2422.1600000000003
the surface being flat

2419.599 --> 2425.04
but i'm always i always try to be very

2422.16 --> 2427.04
careful to outline exactly

2425.04 --> 2429.2799999999997
what my train of thinking is and the

2427.04 --> 2431.52
likelihood and why

2429.28 --> 2434.1600000000003
and i don't just declare like this is

2431.52 --> 2434.16
the truth

2434.88 --> 2440.319
unless i have very direct leads for that

2438.16 --> 2442.56
and it's still going to usually turn out

2440.319 --> 2444.72
to be a gamble it's like

2442.56 --> 2447.2799999999997
like yeah i'm fairly certain that the

2444.72 --> 2450.56
equator is not a literal circle not a

2447.28 --> 2450.5600000000004
euclidean circle

2450.64 --> 2454.16
not a hundred percent sure

2455.599 --> 2461.599
but like with the amount of land

2459.119 --> 2465.319
available north and south

2461.599 --> 2465.319
it seems unlikely

2466.079 --> 2470.1600000000003
i mean there is plenty of land north of

2468.88 --> 2473.28
the equator

2470.16 --> 2476.8799999999997
and it doesn't fit inside the circle

2473.28 --> 2476.88
if it was all euclidean

2477.28 --> 2481.8390000000004
right

2478.72 --> 2481.839
so that's what i do

2482.96 --> 2487.44
and i guess it's kind of tough

2485.28 --> 2489.8390000000004
for a lot of people they don't really

2487.44 --> 2492.0
have this like constructive mind room to

2489.839 --> 2493.839
do that internally

2492.0 --> 2496.16
so they kind of just like listen to

2493.839 --> 2500.52
people again

2496.16 --> 2500.52
and then see if they agree or not

2510.56 --> 2516.0789999999997
flat is fact yep

2513.119 --> 2516.079
hello matthew

2517.839 --> 2523.92
i was presented arguments about places

2520.72 --> 2527.359
with extended days and tools

2523.92 --> 2529.6800000000003
can only work on a cloud

2527.359 --> 2529.68
really

2532.079 --> 2537.6400000000003
extended days

2534.64 --> 2537.64
what

2540.96 --> 2543.68
what the hell

2544.24 --> 2550.839
like who claimed that that sounds

2547.04 --> 2550.839
like what the hell

2552.8 --> 2557.92
i mean there's places where apparently

2556.0 --> 2560.0
the sun never sets

2557.92 --> 2562.48
yeah oh that could only work on the

2560.0 --> 2564.72
globe yeah if you presuppose the sun and

2562.48 --> 2567.52
all that all of that celestial stuff is

2564.72 --> 2569.5989999999997
all physical objects

2567.52 --> 2571.52
in space with the earth ball in between

2569.599 --> 2572.96
yeah then it can only work on a globe

2571.52 --> 2575.04
yeah

2572.96 --> 2578.0
however if it's holographic the sun

2575.04 --> 2580.4
could do whatever the fricking wants

2578.0 --> 2582.24
like very early on i even speculated

2580.4 --> 2584.4
like yeah what if there's some really

2582.24 --> 2587.68
weird celestial [ __ ] going now like what

2584.4 --> 2590.079
if you pass like a potential north

2587.68 --> 2593.7599999999998
antiquater barrier

2590.079 --> 2596.2400000000002
and you just start to see three suns

2593.76 --> 2598.4
and like not like oh sort of a shadow or

2596.24 --> 2600.64
a let's fly but like no actual three

2598.4 --> 2602.56
separate suns

2600.64 --> 2606.0789999999997
and they all cast their own separate

2602.56 --> 2607.599
shadows like oh oh that could only work

2606.079 --> 2609.44
on like what are you talking it's

2607.599 --> 2613.6800000000003
holographic like

2609.44 --> 2615.44
potentially anything crazy could happen

2613.68 --> 2617.359
it could all

2615.44 --> 2619.68
like i don't know man

2617.359 --> 2622.319
it's holographic like who's to say it

2619.68 --> 2624.48
couldn't like turn into a giant fiery

2622.319 --> 2626.64
snake

2624.48 --> 2629.52
that wobbles and crawls

2626.64 --> 2629.52
around the sky

2630.0 --> 2634.88
it's holographic

2632.24 --> 2636.0
it it just seems right now in this

2634.88 --> 2637.119
region

2636.0 --> 2640.16
to look

2637.119 --> 2640.1600000000003
like these discs

2640.319 --> 2643.599
and the moon kind of looks a bit like a

2642.16 --> 2646.3999999999996
rock

2643.599 --> 2649.76
and that's it but it's holographic so

2646.4 --> 2651.839
who's to say it's not able to do some

2649.76 --> 2653.599
really wacky things

2651.839 --> 2656.24
right or it's only possible on the globe

2653.599 --> 2658.56
yeah it's only possible on the globe

2656.24 --> 2660.72
if you assume with your physicality

2658.56 --> 2664.16
assumption bias that those lights in the

2660.72 --> 2667.7599999999998
skies are actual objects

2664.16 --> 2670.3999999999996
shining light over a fast distance onto

2667.76 --> 2673.2000000000003
a ball earth that you're standing on

2670.4 --> 2677.839
yeah then it only works on the globe if

2673.2 --> 2677.839
that's the way you regard those lights

2678.0 --> 2683.2
if you realize that it's quite certainly

2680.56 --> 2686.16
holographic in nature not physical not

2683.2 --> 2688.56
tangible and not certainly not light

2686.16 --> 2690.0789999999997
originating from a euclidean position in

2688.56 --> 2692.319
space

2690.079 --> 2692.319
that

2693.04 --> 2699.359
you can't tell anything about the earth

2696.96 --> 2701.68
and its shape based on the celestial

2699.359 --> 2701.68
lights

2702.079 --> 2707.8390000000004
you can't tell anything about the earth

2705.599 --> 2709.839
you can only figure out oh like there's

2707.839 --> 2712.4
these angular relations

2709.839 --> 2713.599
and specific points

2712.4 --> 2716.319
and that's it

2713.599 --> 2716.319
but they're

2716.839 --> 2721.68
intangible they're weird and holographic

2726.16 --> 2731.44
the only way you can figure out things

2728.96 --> 2733.839
about the earth is by measuring the

2731.44 --> 2733.839
earth

2737.839 --> 2742.04
not the lights in the sky

2752.48 --> 2756.68
hello gum nut man

2783.599 --> 2790.0
watching local low suns

2787.2 --> 2794.48
videos every day

2790.0 --> 2794.48
local lows what what do you mean local

2794.56 --> 2798.48
you mean local as in the videos are made

2796.96 --> 2801.119
in your region

2798.48 --> 2803.839
or actually claiming the sun to be a

2801.119 --> 2803.839
local thing

2805.2 --> 2808.5989999999997
which it is

2827.34 --> 2830.4990000000003
[Music]

2843.2 --> 2847.5989999999997
he said um

2844.48 --> 2849.92
island at 18 hour days

2847.599 --> 2849.92
what

2855.68 --> 2860.319
in the summer in

2857.68 --> 2860.319
i take it

2862.88 --> 2866.2000000000003
adam price

2906.88 --> 2910.7200000000003
okay come nut man

2909.2 --> 2913.1189999999997
sounds a little weird when you say it

2910.72 --> 2913.1189999999997
like that

2913.599 --> 2918.7200000000003
i mean

2915.119 --> 2918.7200000000003
i think i'm doing pretty good

2924.96 --> 2931.04
i mean do i really need to try that much

2928.72 --> 2933.52
it's not like i'm constantly being

2931.04 --> 2936.319
yanked on by some devil telling me like

2933.52 --> 2938.8
oh you could just give this up all you

2936.319 --> 2940.839
need to do is let that go no i'm not in

2938.8 --> 2945.48
some kind of temptation

2940.839 --> 2945.48
phase right now

2956.16 --> 2961.04
not like that anyway

2958.8 --> 2961.6400000000003
it's more isolation that's my challenge

2961.04 --> 2964.699
right now

2961.64 --> 2964.699
[Music]

2966.0 --> 2969.68
i mean you always have a challenge no

2967.599 --> 2971.6800000000003
matter what you do

2969.68 --> 2974.0789999999997
but yeah temptation

2971.68 --> 2976.24
or something especially something bad is

2974.079 --> 2978.6400000000003
not the thing that's like nagging me

2976.24 --> 2978.64
right now

2980.8 --> 2987.079
i'm glad of it

2982.88 --> 2987.079
i hate it when that happens

3018.0 --> 3021.559
a psych bear

3041.839 --> 3044.88
counter blessed

3043.28 --> 3047.44
coming man

3044.88 --> 3052.119
are you again

3047.44 --> 3052.119
you're talking exactly like ajax

3064.8 --> 3069.2400000000002
but yeah if you're not that's fine

3096.16 --> 3099.16
you

3113.2 --> 3116.24
all right come that man

3123.119 --> 3126.839
hey borders boy

3130.08 --> 3133.27
[Music]

3135.96 --> 3139.729
[Music]

3159.359 --> 3164.0789999999997
since learning about sextants flat earth

3161.599 --> 3167.48
is so obvious to everyone baller trolls

3164.079 --> 3167.48
are in tailspin

3168.16 --> 3170.48
right

3171.599 --> 3175.44
well

3172.96 --> 3177.359
they're now basically like they're

3175.44 --> 3179.119
forced into

3177.359 --> 3181.839
machination right it's already there i

3179.119 --> 3184.079
mean terrestrial refraction

3181.839 --> 3185.839
i know we all heard it in refraction

3184.079 --> 3188.6400000000003
back

3185.839 --> 3190.48
but yeah you have to realize they have

3188.64 --> 3194.24
no choice

3190.48 --> 3196.319
and as bowen i will

3194.24 --> 3199.2799999999997
like definitely

3196.319 --> 3202.72
give an example constantly of how to

3199.28 --> 3202.7200000000003
hold on to that properly

3202.8 --> 3205.04
right

3205.28 --> 3209.599
the thing is though that once you do

3207.599 --> 3211.599
everything does become really warped it

3209.599 --> 3214.48
becomes much more of an intellectual

3211.599 --> 3217.2000000000003
challenge it's not just easy

3214.48 --> 3220.48
straightforward after that point

3217.2 --> 3222.8799999999997
so if you're not very mentally flexible

3220.48 --> 3224.8
you will get confused

3222.88 --> 3226.8
if you keep trying to defend the ball

3224.8 --> 3228.0
using terrestrial refraction and nathan

3226.8 --> 3229.3590000000004
is

3228.0 --> 3231.28
like put

3229.359 --> 3233.44
ballers into a position where they

3231.28 --> 3235.28
eventually end up double speaking about

3233.44 --> 3237.76
everything and totally confused because

3235.28 --> 3240.3190000000004
yeah it is very confusing

3237.76 --> 3242.4
if you want to graft

3240.319 --> 3245.119
terrestrial refraction within your

3242.4 --> 3247.6800000000003
argumentation for a ball it's super

3245.119 --> 3247.6800000000003
difficult

3248.16 --> 3256.0789999999997
it really is it's not some something any

3252.0 --> 3256.079
dumbass can do it's that simple

3256.88 --> 3260.7200000000003
right

3257.68 --> 3262.48
you got to be sharp you got to have like

3260.72 --> 3265.2
mental flexibility where you can

3262.48 --> 3266.64
literally

3265.2 --> 3268.8799999999997
warp

3266.64 --> 3270.319
things in your mind

3268.88 --> 3272.88
which is what you have to do is what

3270.319 --> 3276.839
terrestrial refraction is it warps the

3272.88 --> 3280.799
actual flat plane euclidean situation

3276.839 --> 3282.0789999999997
visually into a bow or rather unwraps it

3280.799 --> 3283.92
in the mind

3282.079 --> 3286.4
it is a bow it's the terrestrial

3283.92 --> 3289.28
refraction that makes it look flat right

3286.4 --> 3290.839
you know the earth's a ball

3289.28 --> 3295.44
because it looks so

3290.839 --> 3298.24
flat thanks to terrestrial refraction

3295.44 --> 3299.359
but then you gotta basically after that

3298.24 --> 3302.16
point

3299.359 --> 3305.68
realize that yeah you can't really make

3302.16 --> 3305.68
diagrams with the ball

3305.839 --> 3308.96
because everything

3307.76 --> 3311.119
like the

3308.96 --> 3312.96
effect

3311.119 --> 3316.1600000000003
what a terrestrial fraction actually

3312.96 --> 3318.64
does is like it

3316.16 --> 3320.64
unwraps the ball well

3318.64 --> 3323.44
after that point if you want to use the

3320.64 --> 3325.52
actual bow as it would really be

3323.44 --> 3327.52
in a diagram now now you have to like

3325.52 --> 3329.68
every time you do anything

3327.52 --> 3332.799
you have to bend it so it all just

3329.68 --> 3334.8799999999997
becomes this spherical centered

3332.799 --> 3336.96
warped thing and it becomes even more

3334.88 --> 3339.359
apparent to anybody looking that has

3336.96 --> 3342.559
announced a talent with these things

3339.359 --> 3345.119
that it is actually a flat plane that is

3342.559 --> 3346.799
uniformly being warped

3345.119 --> 3348.96
into a ball

3346.799 --> 3350.48
virtually

3348.96 --> 3353.68
but yeah if you want to believe in the

3350.48 --> 3357.119
ball you really do not have a choice

3353.68 --> 3358.3999999999996
either you go into a deadlock situation

3357.119 --> 3360.079
every time

3358.4 --> 3362.64
every single time

3360.079 --> 3364.48
like yeah black swan

3362.64 --> 3366.24
is not geometric

3364.48 --> 3368.48
well if you then invoke terrestrial

3366.24 --> 3370.9599999999996
refraction you gotta realize that it's

3368.48 --> 3373.92
not an easy thing

3370.96 --> 3374.839
to invoke the conjugation

3373.92 --> 3377.44
it's not

3374.839 --> 3379.04
easy you're going to be confronted with

3377.44 --> 3381.68
the yeah the

3379.04 --> 3384.319
the painful realization that means that

3381.68 --> 3386.319
everything is worked that means you

3384.319 --> 3389.92
can't draw diagrams anymore to

3386.319 --> 3393.52
accurately supposedly represent reality

3389.92 --> 3395.28
without warping every line

3393.52 --> 3397.92
because this terrestrial refraction

3395.28 --> 3399.76
makes everything look flat

3397.92 --> 3402.96
so yeah

3399.76 --> 3405.6800000000003
the ante is up are you really willing to

3402.96 --> 3407.359
dedicate your entire mind to the earth

3405.68 --> 3410.0789999999997
being a ball

3407.359 --> 3413.44
you gotta be able to wrap your head

3410.079 --> 3414.88
around terrestrial refraction

3413.44 --> 3417.2000000000003
pun intended

3414.88 --> 3420.0
if you can't you got a problem you're

3417.2 --> 3421.04
going to end up in a deadlock

3420.0 --> 3422.0
and

3421.04 --> 3425.44
yeah

3422.0 --> 3425.44
and then flat earth wins

3425.92 --> 3431.359
you got to give in at that point so yeah

3429.119 --> 3434.6400000000003
either you take up that challenge and

3431.359 --> 3437.359
allow your mind to warp

3434.64 --> 3437.359
what you see

3437.92 --> 3443.92
or it's over

3440.48 --> 3445.359
terrestrial refraction is the last

3443.92 --> 3447.839
straw

3445.359 --> 3451.92
the globe religion can hold on to to

3447.839 --> 3451.92
convince themselves that it is a ball

3454.88 --> 3460.0
yeah and i know it's a paradox it's my

3457.2 --> 3462.96
paradox right

3460.0 --> 3464.88
the arwynian paradox i discovered it

3462.96 --> 3468.799
yeah

3464.88 --> 3468.799
and i will rule over it

3469.2 --> 3471.9199999999996
as i do

3472.079 --> 3478.119
it's my it's my weapon now

3489.92 --> 3494.799
dingle derp

3491.44 --> 3494.799
syndrome is fatal

3496.16 --> 3501.7599999999998
well it's mentally fatal

3498.4 --> 3503.52
you will turn into a [ __ ] zombie

3501.76 --> 3505.3590000000004
doesn't mean that you will die you might

3503.52 --> 3508.559
still have subconscious mechanisms

3505.359 --> 3512.4
that'll just allow you to survive

3508.559 --> 3512.4
but yeah whatever is in there

3512.88 --> 3517.52
you can only handle so much double speak

3515.2 --> 3519.4399999999996
before you completely break apart and

3517.52 --> 3521.87
and you just become numbed down to

3519.44 --> 3530.42
everything

3521.87 --> 3530.42
[Music]

3544.319 --> 3549.2799999999997
yes gorzilla yeah in a way you're you're

3546.88 --> 3552.0
right yeah

3549.28 --> 3554.6400000000003
constantly lie and then still there is

3552.0 --> 3556.72
like political support people in a way

3554.64 --> 3558.5589999999997
weirdly have that's what happens with

3556.72 --> 3561.4399999999996
the religion especially

3558.559 --> 3563.28
mystery religions

3561.44 --> 3566.16
where the believers don't know what it

3563.28 --> 3570.6800000000003
is actually they're believing in

3566.16 --> 3570.68
they only get the surface of it

3574.079 --> 3578.1600000000003
you will still get political support by

3576.96 --> 3581.359
everybody

3578.16 --> 3583.359
because they think you're defending it

3581.359 --> 3585.2
their group

3583.359 --> 3587.52
even though they don't understand what

3585.2 --> 3588.64
it actually is you're doing as you

3587.52 --> 3590.96
defend

3588.64 --> 3593.7599999999998
what they think

3590.96 --> 3593.76
you're defending

3597.76 --> 3602.6400000000003
and that's very easy it's it's the flock

3600.24 --> 3605.1189999999997
mentality it's just hurting

3602.64 --> 3607.839
it's a herd mechanism and yeah that of

3605.119 --> 3609.92
course they will always have that

3607.839 --> 3612.0789999999997
but just because people support you

3609.92 --> 3615.119
doesn't mean you're right

3612.079 --> 3617.119
doesn't even mean that those people

3615.119 --> 3619.119
even are aware whether you're right or

3617.119 --> 3621.28
wrong they're just supporting you

3619.119 --> 3623.04
they're like on your side they probably

3621.28 --> 3624.7200000000003
a lot of them don't even care whether

3623.04 --> 3626.24
you're right

3624.72 --> 3630.3999999999996
about what you said

3626.24 --> 3633.799
they're just there to support the group

3630.4 --> 3633.799
they don't understand

3668.4 --> 3673.92
oh my god really

3670.72 --> 3675.2
pg sick oh

3673.92 --> 3677.04
god

3675.2 --> 3680.96
no

3677.04 --> 3680.96
no that's so gross

3681.04 --> 3685.839
i can't believe we fell for that

3687.119 --> 3693.119
oh my god when you think things couldn't

3689.839 --> 3693.119
get any uglier

3696.839 --> 3701.7599999999998
dude

3698.799 --> 3704.079
fight the tight shirt is such a [ __ ]

3701.76 --> 3704.079
idiot

3705.92 --> 3711.28
yeah i support the current thing

3708.0 --> 3714.16
somebody should give him like a t-shirt

3711.28 --> 3718.92
that says support the current thing

3714.16 --> 3718.92
and he'd probably wear it

3726.319 --> 3728.64
oh

3728.799 --> 3732.2
so gross

3735.11 --> 3738.1690000000003
[Music]

3770.559 --> 3776.6400000000003
it does really like

3772.96 --> 3779.839
put a big mark on things doesn't it

3776.64 --> 3781.2799999999997
i mean they're not just globe tarts you

3779.839 --> 3783.2799999999997
see

3781.28 --> 3786.6400000000003
they're not just like but i love the

3783.28 --> 3790.4
globe it has to be real no they're also

3786.64 --> 3792.72
[ __ ] trash they're mind controlled

3790.4 --> 3795.28
trash slaves

3792.72 --> 3797.5989999999997
it's like oh if the current thing

3795.28 --> 3800.4
dictation says

3797.599 --> 3801.76
you should be like a murdering monster

3800.4 --> 3804.079
right now

3801.76 --> 3806.7990000000004
then i will support it

3804.079 --> 3806.799
like dude

3807.68 --> 3812.3999999999996
it's not just

3809.2 --> 3816.0
about the globe anymore you're just an

3812.4 --> 3818.2400000000002
out of control mercenary zombie

3816.0 --> 3823.48
at that point you're just

3818.24 --> 3823.4799999999996
like a political mercenary zombie

3824.64 --> 3827.68
it's not about the globe anymore is that

3826.88 --> 3829.76
just

3827.68 --> 3832.0789999999997
there's just one

3829.76 --> 3832.079
button

3834.0 --> 3839.119
one button on like yeah

3836.799 --> 3841.359
on a shirt

3839.119 --> 3843.28
at that point

3841.359 --> 3845.5989999999997
speaking of supporting the current thing

3843.28 --> 3848.799
is

3845.599 --> 3848.799
am i the current thing

3849.44 --> 3852.44
hmm

3852.799 --> 3856.48
well yeah if so then definitely support

3855.359 --> 3860.16
me

3856.48 --> 3860.16
thanks for the super chat godzilla

3863.839 --> 3870.0789999999997
please also consider paypal

3867.119 --> 3871.28
if you actually want to support me

3870.079 --> 3873.599
because that

3871.28 --> 3877.119
does end up in my pocket

3873.599 --> 3879.28
unlike super chats but they're fun

3877.119 --> 3881.839
they're a fun billboard

3879.28 --> 3881.8390000000004
i get it

3911.359 --> 3914.4
you'll get some of it at least

3913.359 --> 3917.119
maybe

3914.4 --> 3917.119
but that's fine

3919.68 --> 3923.1189999999997
that's cool i like your

3921.599 --> 3925.6800000000003
messages you know

3923.119 --> 3928.079
super chatting is a bit of an art too

3925.68 --> 3931.44
and i see you applying it over at nathan

3928.079 --> 3933.6800000000003
oakley's a lot and it's fun

3931.44 --> 3933.68
right

3934.48 --> 3939.599
if you actually want to support me

3936.4 --> 3942.4
financially in a way that's useful

3939.599 --> 3944.7200000000003
then paypal is the way to do it and just

3942.4 --> 3946.4
say it right

3944.72 --> 3948.48
and if you really like doing the

3946.4 --> 3951.119
billboard thing with the super chats

3948.48 --> 3954.96
then like keep it at a minimum amount

3951.119 --> 3954.96
that you can still say something right

3955.52 --> 3958.88
just don't

3956.559 --> 3960.48
like don't pile it on because then it's

3958.88 --> 3962.1600000000003
just such a waste

3960.48 --> 3964.4
i mean

3962.16 --> 3967.68
yeah

3964.4 --> 3969.92
no uh super high super chats

3967.68 --> 3972.16
if you've got money to spend like that

3969.92 --> 3974.319
just please send it through the paypal

3972.16 --> 3976.72
and then i actually get it

3974.319 --> 3976.72
anyway

3977.039 --> 3980.92
thank you for the super chat

3995.44 --> 3999.039
right

3996.96 --> 4001.039
oh by the way george sanford

3999.039 --> 4001.8390000000004
the world would go mentally [ __ ] oh

4001.039 --> 4004.1600000000003
wait

4001.839 --> 4004.16
well

4004.799 --> 4009.28
i wonder how much of the world is

4007.039 --> 4012.48
actually mentally [ __ ]

4009.28 --> 4014.6400000000003
and how much of the world is simply

4012.48 --> 4018.559
lazy

4014.64 --> 4021.7599999999998
and have very easy enabling effects that

4018.559 --> 4023.6800000000003
make them able to act [ __ ] and get

4021.76 --> 4025.76
away with it

4023.68 --> 4028.319
i think there's a lot more people just

4025.76 --> 4031.119
being like oh everybody's [ __ ] now

4028.319 --> 4032.839
so i can just act [ __ ] and i won't

4031.119 --> 4034.6400000000003
stand out it's like

4032.839 --> 4037.0389999999998
yay

4034.64 --> 4040.5589999999997
oh it's so great being dumb for some

4037.039 --> 4042.559
people it is they enjoy being dumb

4040.559 --> 4045.039
weird isn't it

4042.559 --> 4047.599
it's like oh they don't have to be

4045.039 --> 4049.3590000000004
stressed out by all this weird ideas

4047.599 --> 4051.839
they have that have no grounding in

4049.359 --> 4054.0
reality whatsoever so they can just go

4051.839 --> 4055.119
to dumb mode

4054.0 --> 4057.68
right

4055.119 --> 4062.76
well the current

4057.68 --> 4062.7599999999998
media climate enables that

4062.96 --> 4069.28
so i think a lot of people are actually

4065.359 --> 4071.52
acting dumber than they really are

4069.28 --> 4073.76
and you got to realize that when you set

4071.52 --> 4076.72
yourself to something like that you

4073.76 --> 4079.2000000000003
allow that to become you

4076.72 --> 4081.2
then even if you face somebody like in a

4079.2 --> 4084.16
discussion or a debate

4081.2 --> 4086.8799999999997
you won't be able to ascend out of that

4084.16 --> 4089.2799999999997
within the discussion

4086.88 --> 4091.76
right because they are effectively

4089.28 --> 4094.48
[ __ ] because they made themselves

4091.76 --> 4097.52
like they allowed to degrade to that

4094.48 --> 4099.759
mode it's not permanent necessarily

4097.52 --> 4102.080000000001
they're just lazy they just won't get

4099.759 --> 4104.0
out of that mode and they will allow

4102.08 --> 4107.2789999999995
themselves to fail and become super

4104.0 --> 4109.679
humiliated and act embarrassing and

4107.279 --> 4112.56
out of order

4109.679 --> 4114.2390000000005
they won't be able to snap out of it

4112.56 --> 4116.400000000001
that's very difficult

4114.239 --> 4119.759
if you're in the middle of a discussion

4116.4 --> 4122.48
right they would have to step back

4119.759 --> 4124.56
face the pain of what made them lazy in

4122.48 --> 4126.5599999999995
the first place which means taking back

4124.56 --> 4129.279
the responsibility that they put off

4126.56 --> 4130.400000000001
their shoulders taking it back

4129.279 --> 4132.4800000000005
and then

4130.4 --> 4135.2789999999995
once they do that

4132.48 --> 4137.5199999999995
they'll start wisening up a lot

4135.279 --> 4141.679
and become a lot more socially

4137.52 --> 4141.679
respectable naturally that happens

4141.759 --> 4146.56
so don't just think everybody's [ __ ]

4144.239 --> 4149.44
no there's a whole bunch of people that

4146.56 --> 4152.719
are just acting [ __ ]

4149.44 --> 4154.3189999999995
they effectively are because of that act

4152.719 --> 4155.359
they won't get out of it while that's

4154.319 --> 4157.04
happening

4155.359 --> 4158.64
but they do it because they think they

4157.04 --> 4161.12
can get away with it because oh the

4158.64 --> 4162.56
world's [ __ ] so being [ __ ] is

4161.12 --> 4165.3589999999995
okay now

4162.56 --> 4167.679
and then they act [ __ ]

4165.359 --> 4169.1990000000005
and like oh comfortably numb comfortably

4167.679 --> 4172.6
dumb

4169.199 --> 4172.599999999999
that's a thing

4174.0 --> 4176.239
right

4182.48 --> 4186.639999999999
so i just see it like

4185.04 --> 4189.6
that sort of thing

4186.64 --> 4191.839
it's like people are cursed

4189.6 --> 4195.52
right and they enjoy the curse they

4191.839 --> 4197.28
enjoy being retards

4195.52 --> 4199.360000000001
makes things easier they don't have to

4197.28 --> 4203.599999999999
worry so much about things and about

4199.36 --> 4204.88
things going wrong because you're dumb

4203.6 --> 4206.719
right

4204.88 --> 4208.56
people will accept it because you're

4206.719 --> 4210.64
dumb

4208.56 --> 4213.04
that makes it easy anya

4210.64 --> 4216.2390000000005
so yeah career choice right there's

4213.04 --> 4220.239
people that have been caught

4216.239 --> 4221.919999999999
over the ages or like over the decades

4220.239 --> 4225.199
to basically

4221.92 --> 4227.76
act like they're physically handicapped

4225.199 --> 4228.839999999999
and going around in wheelchairs just to

4227.76 --> 4232.159000000001
get

4228.84 --> 4236.08
sympathy right even though they can walk

4232.159 --> 4238.48
they will act it for a very long time

4236.08 --> 4241.199
just to get that well the same thing

4238.48 --> 4243.759999999999
goes for being actually dumb

4241.199 --> 4246.0
they're smart people that can act really

4243.76 --> 4248.2390000000005
dumb and hold on to that

4246.0 --> 4251.199
because it's easy and people won't

4248.239 --> 4254.08
expect as much from you

4251.199 --> 4255.759999999999
to be fair when i was much younger

4254.08 --> 4259.12
i've done that

4255.76 --> 4261.679
i'd be like i don't want to be smart now

4259.12 --> 4263.92
i'm just gonna got in this new group and

4261.679 --> 4265.84
kind of be kind of like an impulsive

4263.92 --> 4268.4800000000005
dumbass

4265.84 --> 4272.88
and that would be great for a very short

4268.48 --> 4274.48
time and then i could i would get to

4272.88 --> 4276.719
restless

4274.48 --> 4278.959999999999
and then snap out of it because i don't

4276.719 --> 4280.32
like it in being dumb i actually do not

4278.96 --> 4283.52
like it

4280.32 --> 4286.48
but it can be temporarily relieving

4283.52 --> 4288.96
right it does unburden you for a bit

4286.48 --> 4291.44
well there's people that made it their

4288.96 --> 4294.4800000000005
life's work

4291.44 --> 4296.719
to act like they're dumb

4294.48 --> 4298.239
there are there are people like that out

4296.719 --> 4300.64
there

4298.239 --> 4302.48
it's quite atrocious

4300.64 --> 4304.96
and sometimes it's pretty difficult to

4302.48 --> 4306.959999999999
even discover them that they are dumb

4304.96 --> 4310.64
because the people that do act like

4306.96 --> 4313.12
they're dumb are actually smart

4310.64 --> 4315.84
and so they will be pretty good at

4313.12 --> 4315.84
acting dumb

4317.87 --> 4321.04
[Music]

4321.52 --> 4328.2390000000005
right so do not underestimate

4325.199 --> 4331.28
it's an act

4328.239 --> 4332.959999999999
and it has a reason

4331.28 --> 4334.96
to be there

4332.96 --> 4336.159
some people like acting like they're

4334.96 --> 4338.32
dumb

4336.159 --> 4340.799999999999
it's it relieves them

4338.32 --> 4344.0
and people will accept it from them if

4340.8 --> 4346.8
they think they are actually dumb

4344.0 --> 4348.96
because yeah he's dumb right

4346.8 --> 4352.12
doesn't know any better don't mind him

4348.96 --> 4352.12
too much

4361.36 --> 4366.0
you've seen that it's insulting to

4363.04 --> 4367.84
people that are truly yeah i know it is

4366.0 --> 4370.32
super

4367.84 --> 4371.84
super insulting

4370.32 --> 4374.08
pjc net

4371.84 --> 4377.1990000000005
the wheelchair thing

4374.08 --> 4379.6
and in a way people acting dumb is kind

4377.199 --> 4381.04
of an insult to people that actually

4379.6 --> 4383.280000000001
have

4381.04 --> 4385.36
mental challenges right but there's the

4383.28 --> 4387.12
thing a lot of people that are really

4385.36 --> 4389.04
mentally challenged

4387.12 --> 4391.36
often

4389.04 --> 4394.239
become really

4391.36 --> 4396.08
dedicated people that build around their

4394.239 --> 4398.08
handicap and then still have a whole

4396.08 --> 4400.88
bunch of talent

4398.08 --> 4404.159
is just a couple of flaws right so they

4400.88 --> 4405.76
won't seem stupid they'll just be oh

4404.159 --> 4407.28
they're not really good at this and that

4405.76 --> 4409.6
right they know that about themselves

4407.28 --> 4411.759999999999
they figure it out so they start out

4409.6 --> 4413.360000000001
like they seem like oh my god i'm kind

4411.76 --> 4416.159000000001
of dumb

4413.36 --> 4417.199
but it's real and then they really work

4416.159 --> 4420.159
on it

4417.199 --> 4422.4
and they still figure out

4420.159 --> 4424.639999999999
kind of how to be smart even with

4422.4 --> 4427.28
actually being dumb

4424.64 --> 4429.76
right and that's

4427.28 --> 4430.719
that's also out there so there's smart

4429.76 --> 4432.719
people

4430.719 --> 4434.4800000000005
acting like they're dumb

4432.719 --> 4436.64
to unburden themselves of the

4434.48 --> 4437.678999999999
responsibility that actually comes with

4436.64 --> 4439.12
insight

4437.679 --> 4440.4800000000005
and burden them from social

4439.12 --> 4441.599999999999
responsibility

4440.48 --> 4444.0
and there's

4441.6 --> 4446.719
actual dumb people

4444.0 --> 4448.48
that are able to act pretty smart and

4446.719 --> 4450.719
they will be respected

4448.48 --> 4450.718999999999
yeah

4450.8 --> 4454.76
both of it is out there

4455.76 --> 4461.12
isn't that just

4457.44 --> 4461.12
funny when you think about it

4464.88 --> 4468.56
can't you be

4466.32 --> 4470.88
smart in some areas and dumb and others

4468.56 --> 4470.88
yes

4473.6 --> 4478.400000000001
but there is such a thing as overall

4476.4 --> 4479.759999999999
structural cohesion

4478.4 --> 4482.639999999999
right

4479.76 --> 4486.159000000001
your method of approach like how refined

4482.64 --> 4488.320000000001
is the fractal output of your spirit and

4486.159 --> 4490.4
your consciousness

4488.32 --> 4491.92
there's just this level and with some

4490.4 --> 4494.839999999999
people it's not

4491.92 --> 4497.84
very refined

4494.84 --> 4499.92
but if they realize that about

4497.84 --> 4501.12
themselves then they can still work with

4499.92 --> 4503.84
that

4501.12 --> 4506.0
and find a way to still actually be

4503.84 --> 4508.32
smart despite

4506.0 --> 4510.33
like operating on a

4508.32 --> 4511.5199999999995
less refined frequency

4510.33 --> 4513.92
[Music]

4511.52 --> 4516.88
right they basically compensated

4513.92 --> 4518.8
effectively with wisdom

4516.88 --> 4520.4800000000005
and they will seem smart even though

4518.8 --> 4523.4800000000005
they might not be all that mechanically

4520.48 --> 4523.48
talented

4527.04 --> 4530.8
fe diplomat and paul p

4531.199 --> 4534.5199999999995
by the way

4544.88 --> 4547.88
right

4556.96 --> 4560.96
i think that

4558.48 --> 4563.36
the whole acting dumb

4560.96 --> 4566.8
is especially

4563.36 --> 4567.679
prevalent like with teenagers

4566.8 --> 4570.64
i think

4567.679 --> 4574.96
a lot of teenagers face that and they

4570.64 --> 4577.1990000000005
eventually grow out of they should right

4574.96 --> 4578.64
acting dumb dumber than they are because

4577.199 --> 4580.5599999999995
it's easy and they want to relieve

4578.64 --> 4583.4400000000005
themselves of that responsibility that's

4580.56 --> 4586.159000000001
being pushed towards them as they grow

4583.44 --> 4590.239
into adulthood and they don't want it so

4586.159 --> 4590.239
they act dumb right to avoid it

4590.88 --> 4595.679
so it's probably very typical to happen

4593.52 --> 4598.8
with teenagers but they're not the only

4595.679 --> 4601.84
ones there's just people

4598.8 --> 4605.400000000001
that still do that

4601.84 --> 4605.400000000001
even as adults

4644.96 --> 4647.96
um

4675.6 --> 4679.679
right

4677.36 --> 4681.5199999999995
i always like to say

4679.679 --> 4683.679
well i don't really typically like to

4681.52 --> 4686.56
say but it is kind of a motto i'm

4683.679 --> 4689.52
holding on to and that is that

4686.56 --> 4690.96
a dumb person is really not that dumb

4689.52 --> 4693.360000000001
if they know

4690.96 --> 4695.52
how dumb they are

4693.36 --> 4697.28
and can be honest with themselves about

4695.52 --> 4698.159000000001
it

4697.28 --> 4701.199
right

4698.159 --> 4703.679
the real dumb people are the ones that

4701.199 --> 4705.44
are really dumb and they can't admit it

4703.679 --> 4709.76
to themselves and they act like they're

4705.44 --> 4714.12
smart those are the real dumbasses

4709.76 --> 4714.12
you know who we speak of

4725.12 --> 4728.0
right

4725.92 --> 4730.2390000000005
and if you even have a boundary like

4728.0 --> 4732.48
that for yourself

4730.239 --> 4735.678999999999
you might even become a little smarter

4732.48 --> 4739.199
as you go

4735.679 --> 4741.04
but first you got to be honest

4739.199 --> 4743.599999999999
that you're not like an incredible

4741.04 --> 4746.0
genius in certain ways even though you

4743.6 --> 4747.120000000001
want that and you want to be associated

4746.0 --> 4750.64
with that

4747.12 --> 4750.64
and be honest about what you got

4751.199 --> 4756.4
and then build on that honestly and then

4754.48 --> 4758.718999999999
you might be smarter you might grow

4756.4 --> 4760.4
smarter you might learn other things

4758.719 --> 4764.0
right that you didn't really want to

4760.4 --> 4766.48
focus on but that actually help

4764.0 --> 4767.84
and that's how you grow out of being

4766.48 --> 4770.718999999999
dumb

4767.84 --> 4773.719
starts with honesty

4770.719 --> 4773.719
self-reflection

4774.56 --> 4779.120000000001
because if you don't do that then you

4776.239 --> 4783.04
can't become a true dumbass

4779.12 --> 4783.04
a dumb person that thinks they're smart

4785.199 --> 4791.839999999999
i'm turning cooker candidates right

4788.88 --> 4791.84
uh

4792.0 --> 4796.159
like tuning craig never grew out of

4794.159 --> 4799.44
their teens

4796.159 --> 4799.44
like two i don't know

4800.239 --> 4803.5199999999995
i don't know about my tune craig for

4802.4 --> 4806.08
sure

4803.52 --> 4808.96
like you can read it off him like he is

4806.08 --> 4810.239
a teenager in a big

4808.96 --> 4811.6
body

4810.239 --> 4814.799999999999
right

4811.6 --> 4814.8
but i'm not sure

4816.32 --> 4820.5599999999995
i mean he's had he said some goofy ass

4818.96 --> 4822.4
[ __ ] right

4820.56 --> 4824.400000000001
but

4822.4 --> 4825.36
he might just be kind of

4824.4 --> 4827.839999999999
like

4825.36 --> 4830.239
a guy that actually enjoys it i mean i

4827.84 --> 4833.92
don't get a scent from a tune like

4830.239 --> 4836.239
like he's degenerating over time right

4833.92 --> 4838.32
i don't see that with him at all

4836.239 --> 4840.638999999999
i don't see him like getting more

4838.32 --> 4842.719
unhealthy starting to shrivel up or

4840.639 --> 4845.1990000000005
something like what happened with

4842.719 --> 4846.719
his name again

4845.199 --> 4849.199
uh

4846.719 --> 4850.2390000000005
with the rueff

4849.199 --> 4853.678999999999
right and

4850.239 --> 4855.919999999999
craig isn't exactly getting more healthy

4853.679 --> 4859.28
looking over time either

4855.92 --> 4862.08
neither is ranty etc etc

4859.28 --> 4864.4
well i don't get that look from mctoon i

4862.08 --> 4867.44
mean yeah he's an anti-flat earther yeah

4864.4 --> 4868.32
he gets really annoying sometimes

4867.44 --> 4871.28
but

4868.32 --> 4871.28
i've seen worse

4871.36 --> 4876.88
and he doesn't look like he's his health

4874.0 --> 4878.88
is degenerating through this

4876.88 --> 4881.28
unlike a bunch of other anti-flat

4878.88 --> 4884.28
earthers that are just palpably

4881.28 --> 4884.28
degenerating

4890.96 --> 4896.4800000000005
i think mattoon might actually really be

4893.36 --> 4896.48
enjoying what he does

4901.6 --> 4905.679
he still looks like he needs a piss

4905.76 --> 4908.639
yeah that's not an indication of health

4907.84 --> 4911.13
though

4908.639 --> 4914.88
godzilla

4911.13 --> 4914.88
[Music]

4917.12 --> 4920.719
hmm

4918.0 --> 4922.8
right pgc net i mean you don't you guys

4920.719 --> 4927.52
don't have to like feel the same about

4922.8 --> 4927.52
it right it's just my impression

4928.48 --> 4934.32
and like he sent me a bible

4932.159 --> 4937.04
yeah

4934.32 --> 4940.48
i mean but he did and he didn't ask him

4937.04 --> 4942.96
he offered it to me like and he actually

4940.48 --> 4945.199
he really meant it as a good deed so he

4942.96 --> 4948.08
has like

4945.199 --> 4952.08
inside of all that weird [ __ ] and baller

4948.08 --> 4954.0
machinations and sneaky and

4952.08 --> 4957.92
tactics

4954.0 --> 4961.28
there is some good impulses in there

4957.92 --> 4964.56
it's not been destroyed

4961.28 --> 4966.8
he still has like some good nature left

4964.56 --> 4969.4400000000005
within all that right

4966.8 --> 4970.4800000000005
that's what i'm convinced of

4969.44 --> 4972.48
and

4970.48 --> 4974.48
it makes sense because if he wouldn't

4972.48 --> 4978.159
then he would start to physically

4974.48 --> 4980.799999999999
degenerate doing that right

4978.159 --> 4982.239
so he has maintained some purity within

4980.8 --> 4985.1990000000005
it all

4982.239 --> 4987.28
and i really hope he works it all out

4985.199 --> 4990.08
and he doesn't lose that that would be

4987.28 --> 4990.08
very tragic

4998.84 --> 5003.12
right yeah now my tune has also been

5002.0 --> 5006.8
very

5003.12 --> 5006.8
very cordial with me

5007.76 --> 5012.320000000001
in general

5009.92 --> 5014.56
like he even addresses me like

5012.32 --> 5017.679
politely like it's like he would say

5014.56 --> 5019.679
like i disagree with that and

5017.679 --> 5021.28
but i don't think you're a bad person

5019.679 --> 5023.04
like just

5021.28 --> 5025.599999999999
like that's

5023.04 --> 5027.6
not really that common anymore

5025.6 --> 5029.04
with anti-flat earthers

5027.6 --> 5030.8
right

5029.04 --> 5033.5199999999995
some of them try but then they just

5030.8 --> 5036.0
can't bear doing that he actually i

5033.52 --> 5038.8
think mctoon actually means it he's very

5036.0 --> 5041.6
serious about that

5038.8 --> 5043.360000000001
and i appreciate that about him right

5041.6 --> 5046.0
that doesn't mean that i really want to

5043.36 --> 5048.719
watch his shows or anything by the way

5046.0 --> 5050.639
but hey if somebody points me at like oh

5048.719 --> 5054.639
look at what mctoon did

5050.639 --> 5057.04
i might actually be inclined to watch it

5054.639 --> 5058.0
because then i get to see the thing that

5057.04 --> 5059.5199999999995
happened

5058.0 --> 5062.4
and i also just get to see like hey how

5059.52 --> 5062.400000000001
is mctoon doing

5063.44 --> 5066.719
is he still doing all right

5069.6 --> 5075.320000000001
anyway

5070.8 --> 5075.320000000001
take a two minute break be right back

5169.36 --> 5172.0
and i'm back

5174.56 --> 5178.92
let's all go dude with the what

5183.12 --> 5186.639
i remember that silly song

5192.96 --> 5201.679
it's like really what is it like 50s

5197.36 --> 5205.28
movie theater advertisement

5201.679 --> 5205.28
like go and buy our snacks

5208.719 --> 5213.52
maybe just an american thing yeah but

5211.84 --> 5216.32
i know

5213.52 --> 5218.96
but it's like one of those things that

5216.32 --> 5220.719
would also like i've seen it through art

5218.96 --> 5222.8
class like

5220.719 --> 5224.719
right

5222.8 --> 5228.719
i've seen it through art class

5224.719 --> 5231.04
like it it's a very like iconic

5228.719 --> 5234.0
snippet

5231.04 --> 5234.0
that's how i know it

5235.44 --> 5240.239
yeah with like the the

5237.12 --> 5243.4
dancing hot dog and popcorn or whatever

5240.239 --> 5243.4
it was

5262.48 --> 5267.5199999999995
all right i think that those little

5264.719 --> 5269.6
thingy the dancing food thingy

5267.52 --> 5272.159000000001
was kind of like the first

5269.6 --> 5274.719
cartoon mascot

5272.159 --> 5276.4
that was being used to sell products

5274.719 --> 5278.2390000000005
like food

5276.4 --> 5280.159
i think it might be like the first one

5278.239 --> 5282.0
where that officially happen in

5280.159 --> 5284.5599999999995
advertisement

5282.0 --> 5287.04
like the start of using mascots for

5284.56 --> 5287.04
products

5288.08 --> 5293.6
right because i've done stuff

5290.56 --> 5296.8
i've had art class like

5293.6 --> 5299.280000000001
in four different schools

5296.8 --> 5301.28
so i've had a lot of art class

5299.28 --> 5304.28
you get to see a lot of those types of

5301.28 --> 5304.28
things

5306.64 --> 5311.280000000001
[Music]

5309.199 --> 5313.36
and i'm very happy about that i always

5311.28 --> 5316.639
enjoyed art class even if the teacher

5313.36 --> 5316.639
were not all that great

5316.96 --> 5320.4
it's still just

5319.12 --> 5321.28
yeah

5320.4 --> 5324.0
it's

5321.28 --> 5326.719
it's very funny because

5324.0 --> 5328.639
the way i experienced some art classes

5326.719 --> 5332.4
was almost like

5328.639 --> 5332.400000000001
like just watching martin luther

5332.48 --> 5338.5599999999995
no disrespect martin you are very

5336.159 --> 5340.339999999999
energetic guy i like it you're very good

5338.56 --> 5343.529
with large bunch of people

5340.34 --> 5343.529
[Music]

5343.6 --> 5347.360000000001
and you do bring a lot of great imagery

5345.92 --> 5348.88
and all that

5347.36 --> 5350.96
but it was like that to me it's like

5348.88 --> 5354.08
okay there's just a teacher they're just

5350.96 --> 5355.84
blabbering something about the art

5354.08 --> 5358.159
and i would disagree with it it's like

5355.84 --> 5360.639
yeah that's super outdated but still i

5358.159 --> 5363.759999999999
get to see really awesome images of like

5360.639 --> 5365.36
old architecture and things and

5363.76 --> 5366.96
that's what i appreciate about it was

5365.36 --> 5370.759999999999
like

5366.96 --> 5370.76
watching martin litka

5380.159 --> 5383.159
anyway

5399.36 --> 5402.36
breathe

5410.56 --> 5413.56
up

5427.36 --> 5430.36
yo

5459.04 --> 5463.44
i bet there is less trolls on sunday

5461.199 --> 5465.759999999999
morning well not always rig back but

5463.44 --> 5467.12
there is today

5465.76 --> 5469.12
i'm

5467.12 --> 5472.32
yeah yesterday

5469.12 --> 5474.159
that was trolls

5472.32 --> 5477.84
the day before that more today it seems

5474.159 --> 5477.839999999999
like it's just like oh

5477.92 --> 5482.4800000000005
maybe they all got hangovers or

5479.6 --> 5485.84
something it has been kind of a party

5482.48 --> 5488.159
atmosphere this weekend

5485.84 --> 5491.84
like even all my roommates all went to

5488.159 --> 5491.839999999999
like this party or something

5492.0 --> 5495.36
on friday

5493.84 --> 5498.2390000000005
there's a lot of party hanging in the

5495.36 --> 5501.239
air and and trolls do still go to

5498.239 --> 5501.239
parties

5505.6 --> 5510.639
martin does some good work on history

5513.04 --> 5517.5199999999995
yeah

5514.96 --> 5521.6
sometimes

5517.52 --> 5523.52
i mean i like the collection of stuff he

5521.6 --> 5527.4400000000005
has

5523.52 --> 5527.4400000000005
his ideas about them however

5530.48 --> 5533.638999999999
i mean

5537.04 --> 5541.04
i think my ideas are a lot better

5541.76 --> 5545.400000000001
that's me right

5546.719 --> 5550.0
but yeah

5547.76 --> 5551.360000000001
it's still just

5550.0 --> 5554.719
interesting

5551.36 --> 5557.92
right he has a lot of juice a lot of

5554.719 --> 5559.679
interesting imagery and it's

5557.92 --> 5562.159
it's just challenging one way or the

5559.679 --> 5564.719
other like even to see like what is this

5562.159 --> 5566.0
is this an actual photograph how was it

5564.719 --> 5567.199
made then

5566.0 --> 5569.679
or is it

5567.199 --> 5571.759999999999
is it a sketch is it was this a building

5569.679 --> 5575.12
that was actually designed or is it a

5571.76 --> 5576.320000000001
design sketch of what could be built

5575.12 --> 5578.719
right

5576.32 --> 5580.32
martin often just like rolls over

5578.719 --> 5582.4800000000005
there's like oh look at this building it

5580.32 --> 5585.199
was destroyed it's like no

5582.48 --> 5587.678999999999
no that's a design sketch it was never

5585.199 --> 5588.799999999999
built obviously

5587.679 --> 5592.0
right

5588.8 --> 5595.28
that's kind of how i watch his shows

5592.0 --> 5598.239
because if you just like listen to

5595.28 --> 5600.08
everything he says unconditionally

5598.239 --> 5601.12
you're not gonna get anything that's

5600.08 --> 5604.159
going on

5601.12 --> 5606.5599999999995
i'm sorry martin you really do

5604.159 --> 5608.719
do that i don't care it's your freaking

5606.56 --> 5611.4400000000005
life you're following

5608.719 --> 5614.2390000000005
right your responsibility

5611.44 --> 5614.239
your price

5614.4 --> 5619.599999999999
i don't want to do that but i i think it

5617.04 --> 5622.32
is kind of funny because

5619.6 --> 5625.1990000000005
i can just figure out basically how he's

5622.32 --> 5625.199
trying to trick me

5625.92 --> 5630.32
it's not working

5628.159 --> 5632.4
but instead of being like uh why is he

5630.32 --> 5635.5199999999995
saying stupid things why is he planting

5632.4 --> 5638.719
stupid suggestions i'm like ah

5635.52 --> 5641.280000000001
this is how this works

5638.719 --> 5644.32
this is what it is i've re-engineered it

5641.28 --> 5647.599999999999
in my mind this is the suggestion will

5644.32 --> 5647.599999999999
people fall for that

5653.04 --> 5658.48
huge amount of assumption dude is it

5655.679 --> 5660.08
the giant assumption squirting fest

5658.48 --> 5663.678999999999
every single time

5660.08 --> 5665.04
like martin is a blabberer he blabbers a

5663.679 --> 5666.4
lot

5665.04 --> 5668.96
but hey

5666.4 --> 5670.32
it's kind of halfway amusing blabbering

5668.96 --> 5672.88
right

5670.32 --> 5675.36
people keep tuning in

5672.88 --> 5675.36
why not

5678.48 --> 5682.799999999999
but i'm not really interested in

5680.639 --> 5684.719
martin's structural approach of the

5682.8 --> 5686.719
material he's dealing with i'm just

5684.719 --> 5687.52
interested in the material he's dealing

5686.719 --> 5691.04
with

5687.52 --> 5695.080000000001
that's what's really interesting to me

5691.04 --> 5695.08
and he deals with a lot

5704.0 --> 5707.6
all right and a lot of flat earthers

5705.52 --> 5709.360000000001
love to fall for it well

5707.6 --> 5711.280000000001
at that point they're not really flat

5709.36 --> 5713.679
earthers anymore now are they they're

5711.28 --> 5716.8
just hippies

5713.679 --> 5719.04
yeah hippies that's right

5716.8 --> 5720.719
before you know it start to form drum

5719.04 --> 5722.88
circles

5720.719 --> 5725.44
if you're not careful if you don't

5722.88 --> 5729.28
get them out of there

5725.44 --> 5730.32
then they start to make festivals

5729.28 --> 5733.36
well

5730.32 --> 5735.36
i think martin is one hell of a hippie

5733.36 --> 5737.04
pretty overtly

5735.36 --> 5738.719
and he kind of pulls it off too it's

5737.04 --> 5742.48
like yeah you get it

5738.719 --> 5744.32
he is a hippie i mean martin litke is a

5742.48 --> 5746.638999999999
hippie

5744.32 --> 5748.159
can't get more straightforward hippie

5746.639 --> 5751.1990000000005
than that guy

5748.159 --> 5751.199
if you know what i mean

5753.36 --> 5757.799999999999
but you got to be careful with hippies

5759.84 --> 5764.32
right if they gather in too many numbers

5762.48 --> 5766.239
then things kind of get tend to get

5764.32 --> 5769.04
[ __ ]

5766.239 --> 5772.718999999999
just like south park called

5769.04 --> 5772.719
in that brilliant episode

5779.6 --> 5783.1990000000005
what's wrong with hippies

5782.08 --> 5785.36
well

5783.199 --> 5786.5599999999995
sloth

5785.36 --> 5789.28
and

5786.56 --> 5791.4400000000005
willing ignorance

5789.28 --> 5793.28
that's what's wrong with hippies

5791.44 --> 5795.839999999999
it's not a like a

5793.28 --> 5798.5599999999995
horrific problem or anything

5795.84 --> 5800.4800000000005
it's just that yeah if you let it

5798.56 --> 5802.4800000000005
just go

5800.48 --> 5804.239
just think that's good then and

5802.48 --> 5807.04
everybody turns into hippies then you

5804.239 --> 5809.839999999999
get a giant sloth epidemic

5807.04 --> 5811.119
and everybody becomes really gullible

5809.84 --> 5814.400000000001
that's what happened that's what

5811.119 --> 5814.4
happened in the 60s

5814.56 --> 5816.88
yeah

5816.96 --> 5825.04
i mean i like hippies sometimes

5820.88 --> 5828.88
my mother was a hippie

5825.04 --> 5831.119
my dad was a bit of a hippie

5828.88 --> 5833.04
but my mother was like really

5831.119 --> 5835.36
like she has like those types of

5833.04 --> 5837.119
photographs

5835.36 --> 5838.08
like when she was young it's like that

5837.119 --> 5840.88
is like

5838.08 --> 5843.679
a model hippie

5840.88 --> 5847.1990000000005
they went in buses they had like

5843.679 --> 5848.32
like headbands with like braided stuff

5847.199 --> 5851.96
and like

5848.32 --> 5851.96
so hippy

5856.159 --> 5862.08
and yeah they're nice

5859.119 --> 5864.639
but hippies kind of squirt

5862.08 --> 5867.04
right literally by the way free love and

5864.639 --> 5869.1990000000005
all that yeah they squirt and squirt

5867.04 --> 5871.28
makes you dumb whether it is mental

5869.199 --> 5873.28
squared or sexual squirt

5871.28 --> 5876.28
it's just a natural fact that's just a

5873.28 --> 5876.28
mechanism

5890.8 --> 5897.4800000000005
the worst thing about hippies is

5893.199 --> 5897.48
patchouli what is that

5902.719 --> 5907.28
i don't know what that is rig back

5904.719 --> 5910.639
remind me

5907.28 --> 5912.4
i've seen a lot of hippy [ __ ] so but the

5910.639 --> 5915.04
smell

5912.4 --> 5915.04
oh god

5915.119 --> 5919.5199999999995
well

5916.8 --> 5923.1990000000005
yeah well i don't mind like

5919.52 --> 5924.88
incense smelling [ __ ] i mean

5923.199 --> 5927.119
i don't mind it i don't like it

5924.88 --> 5930.08
particularly i used to like it i used to

5927.119 --> 5932.5599999999995
burn incense and [ __ ]

5930.08 --> 5935.28
but i do kind of like the smell as long

5932.56 --> 5937.119000000001
as i don't have to be surrounded by it

5935.28 --> 5939.759999999999
all the time

5937.119 --> 5942.639
right

5939.76 --> 5944.400000000001
nice perfume

5942.639 --> 5947.36
right well as long as it's just like

5944.4 --> 5951.799999999999
incense that's cool i do not like

5947.36 --> 5951.799999999999
chemical perfume of any sort

5955.76 --> 5959.280000000001
and hippies do at least tend to avoid

5958.0 --> 5960.159
that crap

5959.28 --> 5961.84
right

5960.159 --> 5964.879999999999
i mean there's one good thing about

5961.84 --> 5967.4400000000005
hippies and that is that they're usually

5964.88 --> 5970.56
more of environmentally aware about

5967.44 --> 5970.5599999999995
things and chemicals

5970.96 --> 5974.56
unless they're like really like junky

5973.119 --> 5976.96
hippies

5974.56 --> 5978.080000000001
and then they're like completely like

5976.96 --> 5979.28
yeah

5978.08 --> 5981.84
they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

5979.28 --> 5981.84
doing

5993.119 --> 5997.44
right but anyway yeah i come from a

5995.199 --> 6000.48
hippie family okay

5997.44 --> 6004.638999999999
so i i reserve the right

6000.48 --> 6004.638999999999
to warn people about hippies

6004.88 --> 6011.119
i really really like that episode of

6008.88 --> 6014.08
south park

6011.119 --> 6015.679
it's like endearing to me because i get

6014.08 --> 6020.08
it

6015.679 --> 6020.08
being among hippies yeah i get

6020.84 --> 6026.56
it they all become [ __ ]

6024.88 --> 6028.32
and it's normal

6026.56 --> 6030.56
and it's okay you can be whatever you

6028.32 --> 6030.5599999999995
want

6032.719 --> 6037.04
i'm tripping man

6034.48 --> 6040.48
i'm going to vegan i'm like i'm going to

6037.04 --> 6042.56
venus oh yes i'm squirting

6040.48 --> 6044.5599999999995
yeah

6042.56 --> 6047.56
dude

6044.56 --> 6047.56
hippies

6063.52 --> 6070.080000000001
right but i i don't really hate hippies

6066.48 --> 6072.799999999999
like cartman does i'm just like

6070.08 --> 6074.8
i realize the risk

6072.8 --> 6078.96
that the risks that are involved that

6074.8 --> 6081.96
usually they themselves are not aware of

6078.96 --> 6081.96
right

6092.4 --> 6094.638999999999
yeah

6094.88 --> 6100.2390000000005
it's funny like my first girlfriend even

6097.199 --> 6105.04
was kind of a neo-hippie

6100.239 --> 6107.759999999999
like a bit of an egyptian themed

6105.04 --> 6111.199
a little bit more eccentric

6107.76 --> 6112.8
a bit sort of glam but not really

6111.199 --> 6115.759999999999
weird heavy

6112.8 --> 6118.76
feels like really weird looking and

6115.76 --> 6118.76
interesting

6122.0 --> 6124.639
so yeah

6124.88 --> 6130.8
second girlfriend which did not last too

6127.199 --> 6132.799999999999
long was just like a stoner hippie

6130.8 --> 6135.8
it's

6132.8 --> 6135.8
uh

6136.32 --> 6140.799999999999
hey steamy traveler long time no see

6138.96 --> 6143.119
good good to have you back how are you

6140.8 --> 6143.119000000001
doing

6144.08 --> 6148.44
we're talking about hippies currently

6160.96 --> 6165.679
happy movement was turned into that but

6162.88 --> 6169.4400000000005
didn't start like that yeah

6165.679 --> 6172.08
i know free mind it started out like a

6169.44 --> 6174.08
shamanistic endeavor right

6172.08 --> 6176.48
very serious all about knowledge

6174.08 --> 6179.44
spiritual knowledge healing

6176.48 --> 6179.44
health food

6179.84 --> 6185.119000000001
awareness of mind control yeah that's

6182.719 --> 6187.199
how it all started that's how the hippie

6185.119 --> 6190.08
culture started and then

6187.199 --> 6194.159
it became industrialized and the music

6190.08 --> 6196.5599999999995
industry started to latch on then drugs

6194.159 --> 6199.44
started to get involved even on the cia

6196.56 --> 6200.639
level yeah they hijacked it and turned

6199.44 --> 6204.759999999999
it from a

6200.639 --> 6204.76
kind of tribal shamanic

6205.52 --> 6210.400000000001
environmental

6207.44 --> 6212.0
actual environmental

6210.4 --> 6216.48
endeavor

6212.0 --> 6216.48
into like yeah a party

6216.84 --> 6221.6
culture that's what they turn it into

6219.679 --> 6223.92
party culture in which

6221.6 --> 6228.8
acting dumb is okay

6223.92 --> 6228.8
in which drug abuse is normalized

6230.4 --> 6234.159
and yeah

6232.56 --> 6235.280000000001
it's kind of pointless in a waste of

6234.159 --> 6237.759999999999
time

6235.28 --> 6240.159
when people do it like that

6237.76 --> 6240.159000000001
i know

6240.239 --> 6244.0
right so in that sense

6242.0 --> 6247.28
i am like a

6244.0 --> 6250.159
more like a hippie founder type i'm very

6247.28 --> 6253.04
shamanic i mean come on guys

6250.159 --> 6254.5599999999995
like i don't have to try that it's just

6253.04 --> 6258.08
me

6254.56 --> 6258.080000000001
it's the way i do things

6258.84 --> 6263.84
everything i grew up like that i grew up

6261.76 --> 6267.6
like being an oracle

6263.84 --> 6267.6
it's just like yeah that's what i do

6267.84 --> 6272.159000000001
and

6268.639 --> 6275.4400000000005
my mother saw that in me allowed it

6272.159 --> 6277.92
to manifest like that

6275.44 --> 6280.799999999999
gave me a purpose

6277.92 --> 6284.08
and i am this

6280.8 --> 6287.76
i am shamanic i am like an oracle i am

6284.08 --> 6291.199
an oracle not like i am one

6287.76 --> 6291.1990000000005
stop downplaying myself

6292.8 --> 6299.1990000000005
and it was rooted in hippie-ism

6296.159 --> 6300.4
right and in my teens especially the

6299.199 --> 6302.96
first half

6300.4 --> 6304.5599999999995
i was a hippie just

6302.96 --> 6306.56
i just was

6304.56 --> 6308.719
i think i started like when i was like

6306.56 --> 6311.84
14

6308.719 --> 6311.84
really with the clothes

6318.96 --> 6324.0
pretty much up until was 21

6321.76 --> 6326.0
and then i kind of transitioned it

6324.0 --> 6327.6
started to work spikies and got more

6326.0 --> 6329.84
gothic and then

6327.6 --> 6331.52
eventually lost the color entirely and

6329.84 --> 6333.28
became more like this and then i lost

6331.52 --> 6335.4400000000005
the spikeys and that's pretty much where

6333.28 --> 6338.4
i am now

6335.44 --> 6338.4
just black

6338.8 --> 6345.119000000001
with a few

6340.159 --> 6347.44
jewels that i've exclusively made myself

6345.119 --> 6350.0
did i have dreadlocks no

6347.44 --> 6354.44
no absolutely not

6350.0 --> 6354.44
no my hair is not suited for that

6358.08 --> 6362.96
but i have had long hair

6360.48 --> 6367.678999999999
kind of like this

6362.96 --> 6370.679
in a ponytail since i was

6367.679 --> 6370.679
13.

6372.639 --> 6376.8
stopped cutting my hair as a decision

6374.88 --> 6379.1990000000005
when i was

6376.8 --> 6381.04
11.

6379.199 --> 6382.5599999999995
then i had a mullet

6381.04 --> 6386.48
when i was 12

6382.56 --> 6387.990000000001
and then at 13 i could actually put it

6386.48 --> 6393.0689999999995
into a ponytail

6387.99 --> 6393.0689999999995
[Music]

6411.199 --> 6415.638999999999
i said no we're younger

6416.32 --> 6418.799999999999
eleven

6420.96 --> 6426.04
no it was eleven

6423.04 --> 6426.04
yeah

6428.639 --> 6433.52
you think trans should have their own

6430.4 --> 6434.96
game separate i totally agree

6433.52 --> 6437.76
i mean

6434.96 --> 6439.92
handicapped people have their own games

6437.76 --> 6440.84
why can't trans people have their own

6439.92 --> 6443.52
games

6440.84 --> 6445.360000000001
right it's just another category of

6443.52 --> 6446.719
handicap uh

6445.36 --> 6447.679
trigger trigger

6446.719 --> 6450.159
no

6447.679 --> 6452.8
but seriously yeah

6450.159 --> 6453.599999999999
do that i mean you could have your own

6452.8 --> 6454.88
thing

6453.6 --> 6458.320000000001
in it

6454.88 --> 6460.8
just leave the freaking women alone just

6458.32 --> 6463.5199999999995
don't put these beefed up men just with

6460.8 --> 6465.679
their penises intact and everything and

6463.52 --> 6468.0
testosterone just saying they're women

6465.679 --> 6469.36

6469.36 --> 6471.839999999999
terrible

6472.4 --> 6475.839999999999
it's like it's not fair

6480.88 --> 6486.639
if you want to have like trans olympics

6483.36 --> 6486.639
then fine

6491.44 --> 6495.04
they know what they're doing yeah

6492.56 --> 6496.56
they're doing it on purpose they're just

6495.04 --> 6498.4
agitating

6496.56 --> 6500.080000000001
to keep people agitated

6498.4 --> 6502.4
like the women there's a lot of women

6500.08 --> 6504.5599999999995

have my freaking hair in 20 years okay

6792.32 --> 6797.5199999999995
at this point i'm pretty certain

6795.76 --> 6803.4400000000005
but yeah it's

6797.52 --> 6806.96
it's not ideal it never was ideal right

6803.44 --> 6809.5199999999995
it never really was

6806.96 --> 6811.599
it's good enough i'm very satisfied with

6809.52 --> 6814.719
this and i kind of like this i kind of

6811.599 --> 6816.88
like this this thing you know why

6814.719 --> 6818.88
because it's kind of like a horn

6816.88 --> 6821.52

that's right yeah yeah yeah

6871.679 --> 6877.119
however this almost this entire show

6875.599 --> 6880.08
i've had like

6877.119 --> 6882.4
six times where i'm like waiting for

6880.08 --> 6885.199
three minutes

6882.4 --> 6887.5199999999995
three or more minutes before somebody

6885.199 --> 6889.919999999999
says anything yeah

6887.52 --> 6892.4800000000005
if nobody's gonna say anything this is

6889.92 --> 6895.1990000000005
what i'm gonna do

6892.48 --> 6897.678999999999
this is what i'm gonna do

6895.199 --> 6900.48
because i don't wanna just sit here

6897.679 --> 6902.96
saying nothing because nobody says

6900.48 --> 6902.959999999999
anything

6903.04 --> 6907.92
i'm an oracle i'm not here for

6906.04 --> 6910.0
storytelling time

6907.92 --> 6911.92
i'm not having a book in front of me i'm

6910.0 --> 6914.639
gonna tell the story for two hours

6911.92 --> 6917.1990000000005
straight i interact with people if

6914.639 --> 6919.92
people don't interact with me i'm gonna

6917.199 --> 6921.919999999999
have to find other frequencies

6919.92 --> 6925.28
for output and this is what's gonna

6921.92 --> 6925.28
happen you understand

6925.92 --> 6932.0
if everybody's gonna resort to sloth

6928.88 --> 6934.159000000001
or just dreaming away yeah i'm gonna

6932.0 --> 6936.719
turn pissed off

6934.159 --> 6938.4
and i'm gonna say very rough [ __ ]

6936.719 --> 6941.36
things

6938.4 --> 6943.92
when trolls appear and do that

6941.36 --> 6946.799999999999
because i don't wanna sit there another

6943.92 --> 6947.92
five minutes waiting for somebody to say

6946.8 --> 6949.84
anything

6947.92 --> 6951.679
that's why

6949.84 --> 6955.03
you understand

6951.679 --> 6958.08
hello gideon sick

6955.03 --> 6958.08
[Music]

6967.84 --> 6971.679
yeah it doesn't matter whether you think

6969.76 --> 6973.92
i sit there and do nothing it's not that

6971.679 --> 6975.76
i'm embarrassed i just don't want to

6973.92 --> 6977.599
waste my time

6975.76 --> 6981.04
yeah

6977.599 --> 6981.04
i'm here for interaction

6982.08 --> 6986.159
if i

6983.199 --> 6989.04
wanted to just sit somewhere in silence

6986.159 --> 6990.0
i do that half the day

6989.04 --> 6993.119
yeah

6990.0 --> 6995.92
i i just sit outside smell more of the

6993.119 --> 6997.679
fresh air and get look outside

6995.92 --> 7000.0
right

6997.679 --> 7003.76
instead of just sitting here and waiting

7000.0 --> 7004.56
for somebody to say anything

7003.76 --> 7005.76
to

7004.56 --> 7008.56
trigger

7005.76 --> 7008.56
a subject

7015.52 --> 7019.92
do i ever come up with an agenda or

7017.44 --> 7020.799999999999
topic list prior to the show i've tried

7019.92 --> 7022.32
that

7020.8 --> 7026.2390000000005
for a while

7022.32 --> 7026.239
and then i'm like yeah [ __ ] that

7027.52 --> 7030.4800000000005
that's not what my show is i don't do

7029.52 --> 7032.96
that

7030.48 --> 7034.879999999999
unless there is something like really

7032.96 --> 7036.8
right there in the moment that inspires

7034.88 --> 7040.2390000000005
me like i watch something right before

7036.8 --> 7040.2390000000005
the show and i'll talk about it

7040.88 --> 7045.119
i don't have a program though that's

7044.0 --> 7047.92
what that is that's what you're

7045.119 --> 7050.32
describing yeah this agenda topic list

7047.92 --> 7053.92
it's called a program

7050.32 --> 7056.239
i don't have a program

7053.92 --> 7058.32
i have a certain order

7056.239 --> 7063.119
of doing things on this show right i

7058.32 --> 7065.36
start out waving hello doing the intro

7063.119 --> 7068.719
doing my intro riddle

7065.36 --> 7070.4
we're doing the weather report

7068.719 --> 7071.44
saying hello to people in chat if

7070.4 --> 7072.719
they're there

7071.44 --> 7075.28
mentioning

7072.719 --> 7075.28
the date

7075.52 --> 7080.639
and start talking about whatever

7078.48 --> 7082.48
i've been doing

7080.639 --> 7084.639
especially if something's really on the

7082.48 --> 7087.44
mind

7084.639 --> 7088.88
and then the rest of the show i interact

7087.44 --> 7089.678999999999
with people

7088.88 --> 7091.92
and

7089.679 --> 7093.04
talk about whatever subjects they bring

7091.92 --> 7097.599
up

7093.04 --> 7097.599
there's trolls then i will ram them down

7097.84 --> 7102.400000000001
this is what my show is that's

7100.48 --> 7104.638999999999
that's the system

7102.4 --> 7107.92
i do not have a program i'm not

7104.639 --> 7107.92
programming people

7109.599 --> 7114.84
i'm interactive this is what i do

7116.92 --> 7120.079
[Music]

7121.679 --> 7126.0
know the vis yeah i know pjc i'm i'm not

7123.92 --> 7128.56
blaming you

7126.0 --> 7131.119
it's just a general thing and it's not

7128.56 --> 7132.639
even like oh how dare you all not say

7131.119 --> 7135.598999999999
anything it's just apparently

7132.639 --> 7137.84
everybody's just like yeah

7135.599 --> 7140.84
it's just i don't have i can't do

7137.84 --> 7143.84
anything with that if everybody's just

7140.84 --> 7146.88
relaxing not saying i can't do anything

7143.84 --> 7150.360000000001
with that it's like yeah that's cool

7146.88 --> 7150.36
boring though

7157.04 --> 7161.76
so yeah sometimes i have to

7159.52 --> 7163.360000000001
sweep up a bit of dust get a little

7161.76 --> 7166.719
rough

7163.36 --> 7166.719
get people going again

7168.56 --> 7173.360000000001
because i want things to talk about on

7170.88 --> 7173.36
my show

7173.52 --> 7177.1990000000005
not particularly good at scraping

7175.679 --> 7178.719
together

7177.199 --> 7180.799999999999
narratives

7178.719 --> 7183.36
programs like that

7180.8 --> 7186.56
i'm just not really good at that i go

7183.36 --> 7187.839999999999
through them too quickly

7186.56 --> 7190.159000000001
right

7187.84 --> 7191.04
i go through them way too quick i and i

7190.159 --> 7193.199
don't

7191.04 --> 7195.119
i don't like to stretch things up if i

7193.199 --> 7197.119
go through it quick i'll go through it

7195.119 --> 7198.799999999999
quick if i miss something i'll readdress

7197.119 --> 7202.799999999999
it until everything is addressed but i

7198.8 --> 7202.8
just go through things really quickly

7208.32 --> 7213.84
huh all right lychee that's funny funny

7210.8 --> 7213.84
coincidence there

7216.56 --> 7220.320000000001
you like the shows where i get angry and

7218.719 --> 7224.32
passionate and start shouting into the

7220.32 --> 7224.32
cameras yeah well i like it too

7225.04 --> 7231.599
right unless i'm like really wrong about

7227.76 --> 7231.599
something and then it's embarrassing

7231.679 --> 7233.84
but

7234.159 --> 7239.839999999999
yeah even then i usually catch on very

7237.28 --> 7242.159
quickly and then correct myself and then

7239.84 --> 7244.0
basically reveal like i was wrong now i

7242.159 --> 7246.0
feel embarrassed for a bit and then get

7244.0 --> 7248.239
over it and move on

7246.0 --> 7248.239
right

7249.119 --> 7254.32
but yeah i do like that about me too

7252.0 --> 7257.84
that i do get passionate and then i that

7254.32 --> 7257.84
i do cross those borders

7258.159 --> 7264.4
because i mean it

7260.48 --> 7267.4
i'm not just randomly spouting violence

7264.4 --> 7267.4
right

7270.32 --> 7274.239
it's not random

7273.199 --> 7276.159
it's

7274.239 --> 7279.28
well judged

7276.159 --> 7282.159
thought through i do not

7279.28 --> 7283.04
give like excessive judgment about

7282.159 --> 7285.598999999999
things

7283.04 --> 7287.679
if there isn't a good cause good reason

7285.599 --> 7290.2390000000005
for that that i can

7287.679 --> 7293.599
like reveal

7290.239 --> 7297.839999999999
and i always reason out why

7293.599 --> 7297.84
i judge somebody harshly

7297.92 --> 7300.32
anyway

7306.0 --> 7309.0
hmm

7311.28 --> 7317.36
what what the [ __ ] he died

7313.679 --> 7321.92
rick back holy [ __ ]

7317.36 --> 7321.92
not that i even know it i i just

7322.159 --> 7326.239
uh

7323.599 --> 7329.599
matt from quantum conscience actually

7326.239 --> 7331.44
reviewed sort of primus album

7329.599 --> 7333.679
when it just came out

7331.44 --> 7335.04
that's how i like

7333.679 --> 7337.04
know about it

7335.04 --> 7338.4
in this moment i never really listened

7337.04 --> 7340.639
to primus

7338.4 --> 7343.119
but he had like a whole bunch of

7340.639 --> 7345.679
criticism like holy [ __ ] they're totally

7343.119 --> 7347.759999999999
shooting themselves in the foot

7345.679 --> 7351.4400000000005
like they're killing their own audience

7347.76 --> 7353.119000000001
that was loyal for a reason

7351.44 --> 7355.598999999999
oh he died for oh

7353.119 --> 7355.598999999999
not die

7356.32 --> 7360.639
okay

7357.679 --> 7360.639
not actually dead

7363.76 --> 7368.639
right okay well if you're interested go

7365.92 --> 7368.639
to uh

7369.44 --> 7373.36
to his website free voice

7376.0 --> 7382.0
free voice dot io

7378.8 --> 7384.4800000000005
let's see if i can find that one

7382.0 --> 7384.48
primus

7387.599 --> 7390.599
dammit

7397.36 --> 7400.639
anyway free voice that i you gotta find

7399.36 --> 7403.36
it yourself but

7400.639 --> 7405.52
he did a whole show about that a while

7403.36 --> 7408.92
ago

7405.52 --> 7408.92
was interesting

7418.48 --> 7422.638999999999
right yeah i get it

7419.92 --> 7424.8
he didn't literally die yeah it's on you

7422.639 --> 7428.079
oh it's on youtube

7424.8 --> 7429.599
oh anyway this is the website of him

7428.079 --> 7431.84
there's some pretty good streams on

7429.599 --> 7435.04
there

7431.84 --> 7437.84
i mean i don't regularly talk about

7435.04 --> 7440.159
quantum of punches too much

7437.84 --> 7442.96
because

7440.159 --> 7445.5199999999995
he's smart but he does things like his

7442.96 --> 7447.92
own way

7445.52 --> 7447.92
and

7448.88 --> 7455.52
there's very little i can add to that

7452.719 --> 7457.84
i mean he is very proficient as what he

7455.52 --> 7457.84
does

7458.48 --> 7462.839999999999
a lot of detail

7460.88 --> 7465.679
framework

7462.84 --> 7467.76
thinking always big picture and i like

7465.679 --> 7469.76
that i do appreciate that i don't always

7467.76 --> 7473.4400000000005
like that

7469.76 --> 7473.4400000000005
sometimes i really do like it

7473.599 --> 7478.4800000000005
i mean i'm not interested in my new

7475.92 --> 7481.4400000000005
details of everything conspiracy right

7478.48 --> 7483.759999999999
i'm not like that at all

7481.44 --> 7486.879999999999
when i i'd like to look at the actual

7483.76 --> 7488.4800000000005
big picture in which conspiracies

7486.88 --> 7489.84
are

7488.48 --> 7492.799999999999
a fragment

7489.84 --> 7495.28
but i definitely want to include the

7492.8 --> 7497.84
the whole range of people that are

7495.28 --> 7500.96
ignoring that and what will they

7497.84 --> 7503.1990000000005
naturally conclude

7500.96 --> 7503.199
right

7504.0 --> 7507.599
not just conspiracy

7505.84 --> 7509.92
people

7507.599 --> 7511.119000000001
i find a lot of them very annoying and

7509.92 --> 7513.679
like

7511.119 --> 7516.839999999999
neurotically jumping to conclusions all

7513.679 --> 7516.84
the time

7525.45 --> 7528.5689999999995
[Music]

7540.159 --> 7543.759999999999
what

7542.4 --> 7545.04
no idea what you're talking about

7543.76 --> 7546.4800000000005
gideon's sick

7545.04 --> 7549.48
jaden

7546.48 --> 7549.48
what

7576.079 --> 7579.599

thought i do draw by but yeah steven

7579.599 --> 7583.04
dude

7580.56 --> 7585.04

7583.04 --> 7588.04
a time you missed a whole bunch of great

7585.04 --> 7588.04
shows

7594.239 --> 7600.239
music yeah i get that

7597.599 --> 7602.88
i don't know what jane's is though never

7600.239 --> 7602.879999999999
heard of that

7603.599 --> 7606.719
i do know tool

7607.599 --> 7609.76
but

7610.719 --> 7616.159
a whole bunch of that type of music like

7613.679 --> 7617.1990000000005
if primus is even close to anything like

7616.159 --> 7619.679
tool

7617.199 --> 7621.5199999999995
i don't like it

7619.679 --> 7623.599
jane's addiction i probably won't like

7621.52 --> 7627.1990000000005
that either i don't like that music guys

7623.599 --> 7627.1990000000005
i think it's very depressing

7628.159 --> 7633.199
if you want to know what i like i like

7630.48 --> 7634.4
mine in a box

7633.199 --> 7638.5599999999995
now that's

7634.4 --> 7638.5599999999995
an entirely different level

7639.199 --> 7644.159
like

7640.0 --> 7644.159
really different it's one guy

7644.84 --> 7648.96
yeah

7646.56 --> 7653.119000000001
pretty much i think maybe like two or

7648.96 --> 7653.119
three but it's mostly one guy

7655.679 --> 7660.4800000000005
now that's music that i like because

7658.0 --> 7662.159
it's a hyper psychological hyper

7660.48 --> 7663.919999999999
spiritual

7662.159 --> 7666.239
and it's just

7663.92 --> 7668.0
amazing

7666.239 --> 7669.28
there's songs in there that are just

7668.0 --> 7670.8
like

7669.28 --> 7672.8
i've heard them

7670.8 --> 7674.400000000001
hundreds of times

7672.8 --> 7675.4400000000005
and then when i hear them again it's

7674.4 --> 7679.28
like

7675.44 --> 7680.96
i just like get so much

7679.28 --> 7683.599
energy

7680.96 --> 7687.76
like this is a holy mission type of

7683.599 --> 7691.28
energy like on a real fractal level

7687.76 --> 7691.280000000001
is really intense to me

7696.159 --> 7699.92
i never had that sort of experience with

7698.32 --> 7702.079
those bands

7699.92 --> 7704.2390000000005
like tulle i was always thought like oh

7702.079 --> 7705.119
they're so smart they're so special they

7704.239 --> 7707.759999999999
have

7705.119 --> 7709.598999999999
smart things they say yeah but it all

7707.76 --> 7711.280000000001
seems

7709.599 --> 7714.079
like

7711.28 --> 7718.719
it's not great it's not strong it's all

7714.079 --> 7718.719
about weakness and dealing with weakness

7719.119 --> 7723.04
it's

7720.079 --> 7726.96
yeah i don't like it

7723.04 --> 7726.96
yeah it's sophisticated i don't like it

7728.48 --> 7732.48
has to be good it has to have power it

7730.719 --> 7735.76
has to have purpose it has to have a

7732.48 --> 7740.919999999999
connection with god and the spirit realm

7735.76 --> 7740.92
those bands don't have that

7747.199 --> 7751.598999999999
and people that listened to them

7749.76 --> 7756.4400000000005
didn't have it either

7751.599 --> 7756.4400000000005
to me they were effectively satanic

7758.639 --> 7762.4800000000005
but yeah what does that mean right

7763.04 --> 7768.239
does it mean like oh they literally

7764.88 --> 7770.96
worship said no it's just like

7768.239 --> 7774.079
it just disconnects it's escapist like

7770.96 --> 7776.639
the whole thing is giant

7774.079 --> 7778.159
escapism

7776.639 --> 7780.639
what they do

7778.159 --> 7780.638999999999
all of them

7781.76 --> 7787.84
and it's funny because in a way mine in

7783.84 --> 7790.88
the box has a bit of it of itself

7787.84 --> 7793.28
but it's all from like a psychologist

7790.88 --> 7795.28
perspective

7793.28 --> 7797.04
and there's never like

7795.28 --> 7800.719
give it up

7797.04 --> 7803.599
it's pointless never it's always

7800.719 --> 7805.84
as a situation that's being sketched and

7803.599 --> 7808.079
has monumental impact

7805.84 --> 7809.1990000000005
what can you learn about it what's going

7808.079 --> 7811.679
to happen

7809.199 --> 7813.678999999999
how will you let this all sink in that's

7811.679 --> 7817.1990000000005
what mine in a box is all about

7813.679 --> 7820.32
specifically that no artsy [ __ ]

7817.199 --> 7822.719
straight forward psychological spiritual

7820.32 --> 7824.96
messages straightforward

7822.719 --> 7829.76
we're guided by

7824.96 --> 7831.44
very retro 90s sounding electronic

7829.76 --> 7833.4400000000005
brilliant

7831.44 --> 7834.96
the best one of the best electronic

7833.44 --> 7837.199
musics

7834.96 --> 7838.56
i've ever heard

7837.199 --> 7840.32
ever

7838.56 --> 7843.04
and it's it's already getting kind of

7840.32 --> 7844.799999999999
old

7843.04 --> 7846.8
it's like

7844.8 --> 7848.0
early 21st century

7846.8 --> 7850.400000000001
level

7848.0 --> 7855.52
like that was kind of the period

7850.4 --> 7859.598999999999
like between 2000 something and 2010

7855.52 --> 7861.92
but it's amazing even now

7859.599 --> 7866.32
there's like four songs and every time i

7861.92 --> 7866.32
hear them it's like holy [ __ ]

7868.0 --> 7871.84
i can hear them echoing in my mind

7893.28 --> 7897.159
it's so what the [ __ ]

7902.239 --> 7905.239
whoa

7912.48 --> 7918.718999999999
holy [ __ ] slow mo moon buggy

7915.36 --> 7921.44
yeah no [ __ ] that sounds intense

7918.719 --> 7924.44
damn bro

7921.44 --> 7924.44
god

7938.56 --> 7942.719
character building or just torture

7940.639 --> 7945.119
building [ __ ]

7942.719 --> 7947.84
i mean i had like a

7945.119 --> 7950.32
a tooth drilled in one time

7947.84 --> 7952.400000000001
and then i didn't take anesthesia

7950.32 --> 7954.5599999999995
it gave me nightmares for two years

7952.4 --> 7956.4
straight every day

7954.56 --> 7958.639
reenacting that it was literal

7956.4 --> 7959.839999999999
post-traumatic stress it was that [ __ ]

7958.639 --> 7961.1990000000005
up

7959.84 --> 7963.4400000000005
right

7961.199 --> 7965.199
i don't recommend it yeah you could call

7963.44 --> 7969.159
it character building or you could just

7965.199 --> 7969.159
