83.84 --> 88.96000000000001
quite beautiful

85.84 --> 88.96000000000001
bit stormy though

89.759 --> 93.6
see the

91.04 --> 94.799
fluffy little clouds up there they don't

93.6 --> 96.479
seem

94.799 --> 99.28
too up high

96.479 --> 99.28
they're rushing

99.759 --> 105.2
there's a nice clear blue sky

102.96 --> 108.24
very deep clear

105.2 --> 110.32000000000001
no traces of any

108.24 --> 112.88
trails left

110.32 --> 116.63999999999999
although yeah they would probably blow

112.88 --> 119.6
disperse very quickly with this wind

116.64 --> 121.92
if they were being laid down

119.6 --> 125.88
it's really beautiful and bright

121.92 --> 125.88
bright autumn sun

128.879 --> 132.679
yeah beautiful day

148.56 --> 150.959
all right

152.72 --> 157.16
hello cleary first in chat

158.48 --> 164.67999999999998
it is monday the 1st of november 2021

169.28 --> 173.2
oh i see i didn't change the title yeah

171.36 --> 177.76000000000002
that was the title i was gonna do

173.2 --> 180.56
yesterday but yesterday i got sick

177.76 --> 184.0
i got kind of carried away saturday

180.56 --> 186.0
i'm gonna blame martin litke

184.0 --> 190.0
his flatter day stream he he just like

186.0 --> 192.879
oh i'm gonna drink absinthe and then i

190.0 --> 193.76
just wanted to sympathize and i did it

192.879 --> 195.92
too

193.76 --> 197.12
even though i know what usually happens

195.92 --> 199.04
when i do

197.12 --> 202.72
and it did

199.04 --> 202.72
but yeah didn't last long

202.959 --> 206.72
and i feel very strong today

208.239 --> 215.20000000000002
because yesterday i must have slept

212.239 --> 217.92000000000002
more yeah more than half the day

215.2 --> 220.79899999999998
and still went to bed early so i had a

217.92 --> 220.79899999999998
lot of rest

221.68 --> 226.28
and it did me a whole lot of good i

223.28 --> 226.28
think

229.84 --> 234.48
yeah hello good servant

231.84 --> 234.48
sam sam

236.48 --> 241.04
right so yeah disregard the title for

239.04 --> 242.79899999999998
now

241.04 --> 245.2
yeah if i find something better to

242.799 --> 248.0
change it in i will

245.2 --> 250.159
or it might become the subject after all

248.0 --> 253.12
i don't know it's not exactly what's on

250.159 --> 253.12
my heart right now

253.599 --> 258.479
because yeah saturday was a crazy day i

256.16 --> 259.6
had a lot of energy but

258.479 --> 264.4
like

259.6 --> 264.40000000000003
it kind of went up to a boiling point

264.8 --> 270.08
in the evening

266.8 --> 271.36
turned into mania a bit

270.08 --> 274.88
right

271.36 --> 274.88
but i'm definitely through that

277.04 --> 280.36
little clutch

283.52 --> 289.919
right also yeah saturday

286.24 --> 293.52
was it somebody recommended me a channel

289.919 --> 293.52
and i did check out his stream

294.479 --> 300.4
was it again

296.56 --> 300.4
yeah jeffrey daughtry

301.84 --> 308.15999999999997
and yeah i think i got pretty close to

303.84 --> 309.67999999999995
my uh superficial analysis my uh

308.16 --> 310.96000000000004
first glance

309.68 --> 314.16
impression

310.96 --> 314.15999999999997
i think i was pretty close

314.4 --> 318.88
but yeah the

316.4 --> 320.96
the choices of words that the guy used

318.88 --> 323.36
in some instances were

320.96 --> 327.19899999999996
very interesting

323.36 --> 328.47900000000004
but it did get kind of sloppy

327.199 --> 331.52000000000004
so

328.479 --> 334.4
i think this guy yeah i don't know

331.52 --> 336.4
i understand why somebody would

334.4 --> 339.84
follow that guy because he does have a

336.4 --> 339.84
few interesting things to say

342.0 --> 344.32
right

347.919 --> 351.71999999999997
right what else

355.759 --> 362.639
oh yeah flat side had a

358.96 --> 364.84
an interesting very interesting video

362.639 --> 367.36
about old

364.84 --> 371.039
photography and like how to do how they

367.36 --> 373.6
did trick photography in old movies

371.039 --> 375.59999999999997
and it was an old video about it

373.6 --> 378.47900000000004
just very interesting to look through

375.6 --> 380.47900000000004
that and how well it works

378.479 --> 382.479
it's pretty amazing so if you haven't

380.479 --> 385.919
seen that check out flat swords latest

382.479 --> 385.919
videos video

387.44 --> 390.88
spaceball is faked

391.12 --> 397.199
that's what it's called also jim bob

395.28 --> 400.67999999999995
had another talk about gravity i was

397.199 --> 400.68
present there

412.319 --> 416.8
so yeah halloween happened yesterday

417.039 --> 421.039
but yeah i was just

418.639 --> 422.88
kind of sick and in bed most of the time

421.039 --> 425.84
it had a really

422.88 --> 428.8
a streak of crazy bad luck like really

425.84 --> 431.84
rapidly to sing after each other

428.8 --> 434.08
that was nuts

431.84 --> 436.15999999999997
like yeah as i was going under the

434.08 --> 437.84
shower when i when i got like the peak

436.16 --> 440.56
sickness

437.84 --> 442.15999999999997
like the shower got clogged like when i

440.56 --> 447.12
just

442.16 --> 447.12
started was that was a total disaster

447.199 --> 452.40000000000003
i managed to fix it afterward

449.52 --> 453.919
but yeah as i was gonna go for like to

452.4 --> 457.19899999999996
get

453.919 --> 459.75899999999996
to get it fixed my key broke off in my

457.199 --> 459.759
bike lock

460.4 --> 465.19899999999996
and oh yeah also a button from my jacket

463.68 --> 467.919
snapped off like pretty much

465.199 --> 470.479
simultaneously it's like what the hell

467.919 --> 471.84
anyway i got a new bike lock

470.479 --> 474.4
cost me like

471.84 --> 477.039
35 euros

474.4 --> 479.84
i yeah managed to put the button back on

477.039 --> 479.84
my jacket

480.639 --> 485.759
so that's

482.16 --> 488.8
always and unclog the shower of course

485.759 --> 489.68
and then finish getting the shower

488.8 --> 490.879
later

489.68 --> 493.12
right so

490.879 --> 495.12
weird day for me yesterday

493.12 --> 496.56
challenging but

495.12 --> 498.479
it did

496.56 --> 501.039
yeah work out just great i thought like

498.479 --> 504.68
oh my god so unlucky all that [ __ ] but

501.039 --> 504.68
it just went away

507.52 --> 510.4
so that was nice

510.56 --> 513.599
that it went away

514.0 --> 517.12
hello nathan oakley

518.159 --> 523.279
entropy

520.959 --> 523.279
nah

526.48 --> 530.279
well the button maybe

536.08 --> 540.399
jeffrey daughtry is a flurf

538.8 --> 542.0799999999999
okay

540.399 --> 545.04
cleary

542.08 --> 546.64
well i wouldn't say because he still he

545.04 --> 549.04
uses the word

546.64 --> 552.24
on our planet and all that so

549.04 --> 552.24
is he really a flerf

552.72 --> 557.2
if he is

554.399 --> 559.76
then he hasn't really integrated the

557.2 --> 563.2
proper vernacular so it doesn't seem to

559.76 --> 566.2
be very hardcore as a flat earther

563.2 --> 566.2
clearly

577.6 --> 580.6
ugh

590.16 --> 595.04
who is he

592.8 --> 595.04
uh

596.0 --> 600.72
yeah nathan uh that's a guy that was

598.24 --> 602.64
recommended to me i before yesterday and

600.72 --> 605.839
never or before two days ago i never

602.64 --> 605.8389999999999
heard of him

606.32 --> 609.519
but

607.36 --> 612.0
he's on

609.519 --> 616.6
on rockfin

612.0 --> 616.6
i'll put the link again in chat

646.24 --> 649.519
he is an [ __ ]

657.76 --> 662.88
i don't know

659.279 --> 662.88
i just watched one stream and

666.079 --> 669.92
i mean yeah he does have some

667.6 --> 673.279
interesting idea he's very like

669.92 --> 673.279
independent minded

673.76 --> 679.6
like he's a guy that

675.44 --> 679.6
i guess typically doesn't like to adapt

680.16 --> 684.56
so yeah maybe in the past he was much

682.64 --> 686.8
more of an [ __ ] maybe he still is i

684.56 --> 689.8389999999999
don't know i've just seen one recent

686.8 --> 689.8389999999999
stream that's it

692.64 --> 695.8
all right

706.0 --> 710.079
but yeah he did have like all these

707.92 --> 713.279
weird

710.079 --> 717.079
themed streams about

713.279 --> 717.079
what was it again the

720.24 --> 725.9590000000001
flat tober fest

722.56 --> 725.959
think it was

742.0 --> 746.079
so yeah but i haven't actually checked

743.76 --> 748.56
those out i i checked out like half of

746.079 --> 752.959
his last stream

748.56 --> 752.959
the archons rise of the archons

755.44 --> 758.7600000000001
that's it

769.12 --> 777.079
he has dividing rods given what

773.12 --> 777.079
he does okay

787.68 --> 792.0
he's you mean his side

795.04 --> 799.68
yeah a little i get what dude every time

797.519 --> 801.839
somebody says that snake oil salesman

799.68 --> 804.0
it's so annoying because snake oil

801.839 --> 805.6800000000001
actually works

804.0 --> 806.399
this is

805.68 --> 808.6389999999999
like

806.399 --> 811.2
snake oil salesman

808.639 --> 814.639
is a medical industrial complex

811.2 --> 816.88
propaganda invention you do realize that

814.639 --> 816.88
right

822.48 --> 826.839
yeah well he does what he has the

825.76 --> 829.8389999999999
the

826.839 --> 832.8800000000001
typical dewyness

829.839 --> 836.5600000000001
so yeah shock and awe

832.88 --> 836.56
interesting story but

839.76 --> 844.88
right he is assimilated some but i don't

842.56 --> 847.04
get the feeling he has fractal inside at

844.88 --> 847.04
all

848.0 --> 851.92
he's a bit of a fantasist in some

849.92 --> 853.279
regions i guess

851.92 --> 854.8
right but yeah that's

853.279 --> 856.72
that's what i got out of just watching

854.8 --> 860.959
one stream i don't know

856.72 --> 860.9590000000001
after that i kind of like yeah i'm not

861.44 --> 865.9200000000001
like the first half of it he got really

863.92 --> 868.079
concentrated and after that it kind of

865.92 --> 868.079
like

868.56 --> 871.8389999999999
became just blabbering

876.959 --> 881.68
you know what i mean yeah he does also

879.6 --> 884.24
have his own product he sells but look

881.68 --> 886.079
there's like half the serious

884.24 --> 888.639
professional streamers out there have

886.079 --> 891.6389999999999
some kind of a product they sell

888.639 --> 891.639
so

899.36 --> 905.36
looked at his website what is his

901.44 --> 907.6800000000001
website you mean just a rockfin page

905.36 --> 911.32
does he have an actual website

907.68 --> 911.3199999999999
i didn't see it

919.519 --> 922.519
do

926.079 --> 929.68
where could he even see his website

938.639 --> 942.32
oh right no sorry like right

945.04 --> 949.519
uh rub your snake oil on this no it

947.36 --> 950.48
doesn't work for that it's not a cure

949.519 --> 953.48
all

950.48 --> 953.48
nathan

958.32 --> 961.32
hello

969.24 --> 975.759
5w30 what does that mean

972.0 --> 975.759
he makes a lot of money i'd no doubt

976.48 --> 979.759
he does look like a jew

978.959 --> 983.8389999999999
no

979.759 --> 983.839
no negative implications necessarily

988.24 --> 993.92
sounds juicy new from kid

991.6 --> 993.9200000000001
what

995.6 --> 997.839
okay

1009.04 --> 1014.399
god very probably well that's not really

1012.0 --> 1014.399
english

1014.56 --> 1017.1199999999999
ex gen

1019.759 --> 1023.04
but

1020.88 --> 1026.72
yeah i agree

1023.04 --> 1026.72
he used to be what

1028.64 --> 1033.88
cleary i l what are you talking about

1044.4 --> 1050.0800000000002
right man created religions not god

1047.679 --> 1053.679
big g right

1050.08 --> 1058.6
that's right god creates the information

1053.679 --> 1058.6000000000001
man-made religion with the information

1077.2 --> 1082.72
very probably is a fairly common

1080.24 --> 1083.84
expression yeah but it's technically not

1082.72 --> 1086.32
correct

1083.84 --> 1088.3999999999999
it feels very off to say that

1086.32 --> 1091.3999999999999
that's like how a foreigner would use

1088.4 --> 1091.4
english

1096.48 --> 1102.88
right it's either very likely

1100.16 --> 1106.6000000000001
or just probably

1102.88 --> 1106.6000000000001
not very probably

1117.52 --> 1125.44
i don't get there yeah no [ __ ] godzilla

1119.919 --> 1130.679
i don't get niche american television

1125.44 --> 1130.679
references yeah no [ __ ] i don't get them

1153.84 --> 1156.799
interesting topic

1157.2 --> 1160.2
sure

1186.08 --> 1192.8799999999999
right but yeah religion

1189.679 --> 1194.799
is a difficult thing because religion

1192.88 --> 1196.3200000000002
can actually

1194.799 --> 1198.72
guide you in

1196.32 --> 1200.3999999999999
typical behavior that can be

1198.72 --> 1202.4
good

1200.4 --> 1204.88
the problem is is when

1202.4 --> 1207.3600000000001
where the priesthood tricks come in you

1204.88 --> 1210.0
see that's the problem where

1207.36 --> 1211.6789999999999
it doesn't just become

1210.0 --> 1214.799
giving you a

1211.679 --> 1218.0800000000002
a format to do good things

1214.799 --> 1219.44
and to focus on that and to stay on that

1218.08 --> 1222.1589999999999
but also

1219.44 --> 1225.2
how to yeah like how can the priesthood

1222.159 --> 1225.2
keep you in

1226.24 --> 1232.159
make you drag in other people

1229.28 --> 1234.3999999999999
and especially when they refuse

1232.159 --> 1236.5590000000002
kind of make them your enemy

1234.4 --> 1239.1200000000001
that is the real priest trick that's the

1236.559 --> 1240.72
real problem then it becomes devil

1239.12 --> 1242.559
persecution

1240.72 --> 1245.039
and there's some people that hang on to

1242.559 --> 1246.08
this like their life depends on it

1245.039 --> 1248.08
because

1246.08 --> 1250.48
they've allowed themselves to become

1248.08 --> 1253.12
indoctrinated like that

1250.48 --> 1255.76
they made it personal they used the

1253.12 --> 1257.6
devil persecution

1255.76 --> 1262.4
to avoid

1257.6 --> 1266.48
facing their their own inflexibility

1262.4 --> 1266.48
yeah that's exactly how that works

1266.72 --> 1270.96
right devil persecutors always

1270.159 --> 1273.44
are

1270.96 --> 1275.1200000000001
psychologically inflexible and that's

1273.44 --> 1277.44
why they do that

1275.12 --> 1278.1589999999999
that's why they're not like jesus just

1277.44 --> 1279.28
like

1278.159 --> 1280.88
okay

1279.28 --> 1284.3999999999999
you think like this

1280.88 --> 1285.3600000000001
well if it's wrong you're gonna find out

1284.4 --> 1288.0
and then

1285.36 --> 1291.36
no issue no personal issue no grudge

1288.0 --> 1293.28
nothing right that's how you should be

1291.36 --> 1295.12
going about

1293.28 --> 1298.8799999999999
right and of course defend yourself if

1295.12 --> 1298.8799999999999
you're going to be directly assaulted

1299.28 --> 1301.76
but

1300.48 --> 1304.48
stop it

1301.76 --> 1306.08
as soon as you as the assault stops and

1304.48 --> 1307.6
realize that

1306.08 --> 1309.84
the assault may

1307.6 --> 1314.24
be coming forth from a misunderstanding

1309.84 --> 1316.6399999999999
or a temporary delusion or a personal

1314.24 --> 1318.4
yeah weakness moment

1316.64 --> 1320.24
right you should know that as a real

1318.4 --> 1323.039
christian

1320.24 --> 1325.679
somebody who follows the path

1323.039 --> 1329.039
and realize that you don't really have

1325.679 --> 1329.76
enemies only people that are just kind

1329.039 --> 1332.72
of

1329.76 --> 1334.1589999999999
think they are

1332.72 --> 1337.039
yeah there's some christians out there

1334.159 --> 1339.8400000000001
that are not like that at all

1337.039 --> 1342.32
and they become quite paranoid devil

1339.84 --> 1345.4399999999998
persecutors

1342.32 --> 1347.76
and that might even be pacifist devil

1345.44 --> 1350.0
persecutors but they will be in that

1347.76 --> 1352.64
mode like oh my god i have to defend

1350.0 --> 1354.559
myself against this unholiness we're

1352.64 --> 1356.5590000000002
being infiltrated by devils and then

1354.559 --> 1358.559
just like oh i'm a good christian i'm a

1356.559 --> 1360.3999999999999
good christian

1358.559 --> 1362.8799999999999
instead of like

1360.4 --> 1364.799
maybe i shouldn't be so afraid

1362.88 --> 1367.44
right don't fear

1364.799 --> 1369.039
like jesus's most repeated

1367.44 --> 1371.44
advice

1369.039 --> 1371.44
you know

1372.72 --> 1375.44
instead of being concerned that you're

1374.64 --> 1378.159
not

1375.44 --> 1381.44
being caught on doing some imperfection

1378.159 --> 1384.159
right because we're still supposed to be

1381.44 --> 1386.24
human as a balance

1384.159 --> 1389.3600000000001
we will have impulses we will have

1386.24 --> 1391.2
impulses that challenge our convictions

1389.36 --> 1392.1589999999999
and everybody has to learn to deal with

1391.2 --> 1394.72
that

1392.159 --> 1397.44
you can't just force it out of you

1394.72 --> 1400.48
because then you end up paranoid against

1397.44 --> 1402.24
your own impulses

1400.48 --> 1404.88
you just have to deal with it like with

1402.24 --> 1404.88
everything else

1408.0 --> 1411.64
hey james mason

1418.24 --> 1423.6
it's corrupted by man now what

1420.96 --> 1426.159
look a religion you can't even say it's

1423.6 --> 1430.3999999999999
corrupted by man it's just that because

1426.159 --> 1433.44
of the nature of religion of a

1430.4 --> 1433.44
collection of

1434.64 --> 1439.44
traditions and behaviors that are like

1442.32 --> 1446.48
emphasized

1443.679 --> 1450.799
forced perhaps

1446.48 --> 1452.88
it always does come automatically with a

1450.799 --> 1455.279
managing class the priesthood class it's

1452.88 --> 1457.279
like you can't do it without it you

1455.279 --> 1459.919
can't have a cohesive

1457.279 --> 1462.559
group set up religion without a priest

1459.919 --> 1465.279
class that keeps it under control and

1462.559 --> 1467.76
it's almost impossible not

1465.279 --> 1471.76
to end up at a point with the priest

1467.76 --> 1474.32
class where they have to use tricks

1471.76 --> 1475.76
to prevent the people from suddenly

1474.32 --> 1478.799
turning on them

1475.76 --> 1481.039
or scattering or creating infighting

1478.799 --> 1482.799
right you have to keep the peace

1481.039 --> 1485.919
in a way and

1482.799 --> 1487.679
then always typical priesthood my little

1485.919 --> 1489.44
mind control tricks

1487.679 --> 1492.24
slip in and that comes with

1489.44 --> 1494.48
indoctrinations to kind of spell people

1492.24 --> 1497.44
to pacify them

1494.48 --> 1499.52
or to stabilize their faith in a

1497.44 --> 1502.559
position even though it's based on a

1499.52 --> 1502.559
spellcraft trick

1504.48 --> 1508.96
and that is literally what jesus warned

1507.039 --> 1511.12
about when he

1508.96 --> 1513.3600000000001
mentioned all that right it's not about

1511.12 --> 1515.6
organizing a group

1513.36 --> 1517.039
it's about a priest whose hood class

1515.6 --> 1520.7199999999998
that then

1517.039 --> 1523.279
ends up managing the sheep and then

1520.72 --> 1525.919
start to use mind control tricks on the

1523.279 --> 1527.919
sheep to keep them at their side

1525.919 --> 1530.3200000000002
that is the universal problem with

1527.919 --> 1531.679
religion and that's why he was against

1530.32 --> 1532.559
that

1531.679 --> 1534.4
like

1532.559 --> 1536.32
find god in yourself

1534.4 --> 1538.4
don't seek god

1536.32 --> 1538.3999999999999
in

1540.84 --> 1547.799
another i'm paraphrasing probably

1543.919 --> 1547.7990000000002
but you know what i mean

1563.679 --> 1568.24
all right so rumors have been spreading

1567.12 --> 1569.76
also i

1568.24 --> 1571.1200000000001
find it hilarious enough to make a

1569.76 --> 1573.2
mention of it

1571.12 --> 1576.8799999999999
rooms are spreading biden pooped his

1573.2 --> 1576.88
pants poopy pants widen

1578.159 --> 1582.919
it's so childish but it's just funny

1584.88 --> 1588.6000000000001
they preached to me

1614.24 --> 1619.2
preach to me brother

1616.72 --> 1619.2
all right

1620.96 --> 1629.6000000000001
well i try not to preach i try to inform

1624.48 --> 1629.6
and i try to lay out thoughts and ideas

1630.64 --> 1634.0
and then i don't know maybe draw

1632.64 --> 1636.0800000000002
conclusions

1634.0 --> 1637.679
in conjunction with other people's

1636.08 --> 1640.48
responses

1637.679 --> 1642.3200000000002
or simply my own

1640.48 --> 1645.919
is that preaching or is it just

1642.32 --> 1647.52
communicating and trying to figure out

1645.919 --> 1650.0
things

1647.52 --> 1652.32
is that preaching

1650.0 --> 1656.64
i mean i don't have some mystical thing

1652.32 --> 1659.76
that i'm like saying this is the thing

1656.64 --> 1660.96
right well perhaps other than

1659.76 --> 1663.12
well

1660.96 --> 1664.159
like things like my spirit mechanics and

1663.12 --> 1668.08
all that

1664.159 --> 1670.7990000000002
but again that's still just explaining

1668.08 --> 1673.12
and trying to help other people

1670.799 --> 1675.12
gain a grasp on how that works so they

1673.12 --> 1679.12
could do it too so it's more like skill

1675.12 --> 1682.12
sharing in a way in a very complicated

1679.12 --> 1682.12
corner

1692.0 --> 1695.0
um

1705.36 --> 1711.6
so yeah how was everybody's weekend

1709.6 --> 1714.08
a lot of people were doing halloween

1711.6 --> 1714.08
thingies

1714.24 --> 1718.08
like

1715.919 --> 1719.44
uh in the netherlands there's no like

1718.08 --> 1722.72
halloween

1719.44 --> 1725.2
trick or treat tradition at least

1722.72 --> 1727.52
not that i've bumped into out there

1725.2 --> 1729.1200000000001
but there are typical like halloween

1727.52 --> 1731.039
parties

1729.12 --> 1733.12
or it's like oh yeah dress up go to a

1731.039 --> 1734.72
party and then it's that theme and

1733.12 --> 1739.4799999999998
that's it

1734.72 --> 1739.48
usually with drinking and stuff and

1739.679 --> 1744.64
just typical parties but with halloween

1741.76 --> 1748.1589999999999
theme we do do or there is a lot of that

1744.64 --> 1749.44
going around very popular among students

1748.159 --> 1752.919
among people

1749.44 --> 1752.919
student age

1755.279 --> 1760.64
so yeah roommates went to

1757.84 --> 1760.6399999999999
parties like that

1764.96 --> 1770.159
we set up decorations no tricks or

1767.2 --> 1770.159
treaters showed up

1778.84 --> 1783.76
ah you should

1781.2 --> 1785.2
no that's mean by the way but

1783.76 --> 1786.8799999999999
you yeah

1785.2 --> 1789.279
and it's late

1786.88 --> 1791.5200000000002
you could have put up signs like no

1789.279 --> 1794.799
factors allowed

1791.52 --> 1796.8799999999999
only unvaxed kids get candy

1794.799 --> 1801.1589999999999
but yeah that's

1796.88 --> 1801.159
that probably gets you into trouble

1816.399 --> 1820.039
hello gaining wisdom

1824.88 --> 1831.0800000000002
mysticism war of the mystics what what

1827.6 --> 1831.08
are you talking about

1848.64 --> 1852.88
as far as i'm concerned

1851.279 --> 1854.64
spiritualism

1852.88 --> 1857.919
and mysticism

1854.64 --> 1857.919
are kind of the opposite

1858.24 --> 1862.24
our spiritualism

1859.84 --> 1866.0
tries to make you understand

1862.24 --> 1868.3990000000001
things practically like basically also

1866.0 --> 1869.76
help you figure out spirit mechanics all

1868.399 --> 1871.1999999999998
that

1869.76 --> 1873.84
mysticism

1871.2 --> 1875.8400000000001
is mostly about keeping a secret and

1873.84 --> 1878.08
then revering that secret and then

1875.84 --> 1880.6399999999999
protecting that secret even if you don't

1878.08 --> 1880.6399999999999
understand

1880.72 --> 1884.96
mysticism is all about secrets and about

1883.679 --> 1887.039
how

1884.96 --> 1889.2
do you regard something

1887.039 --> 1890.64
that you're not supposed to know

1889.2 --> 1894.88
or that is

1890.64 --> 1894.88
well mystical like you don't understand

1895.039 --> 1899.2
that's the real root of mysticism

1899.44 --> 1903.3600000000001
because mysteries can have a very

1901.279 --> 1905.44
binding effect right it plays into

1903.36 --> 1907.279
curiosity and if that curiosity is then

1905.44 --> 1912.3200000000002
never satisfied

1907.279 --> 1912.32
that can like hold people onto a line

1912.64 --> 1916.24
that's why it works

1914.96 --> 1918.159
because there's people that will be like

1916.24 --> 1920.48
yeah i'll do whatever it takes i want to

1918.159 --> 1922.96
know the secret in the end because then

1920.48 --> 1928.039
they too have power

1922.96 --> 1928.039
because of the secret and knowing it

1958.08 --> 1962.72
yeah yeah clutch

1960.72 --> 1965.1200000000001
you're in america right or were you in

1962.72 --> 1967.3600000000001
canada

1965.12 --> 1968.8799999999999
but look america is a whole not a deal

1967.36 --> 1970.399
when it comes to halloween there's all

1968.88 --> 1973.279
this

1970.399 --> 1975.4399999999998
just like it's all about dressing up the

1973.279 --> 1978.32
kids and the candy and all that it's

1975.44 --> 1978.3200000000002
very american

1989.279 --> 1995.12
all right next gen thanks for popping by

1991.279 --> 1995.12
have a good dinner i take it

1999.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
hey thanks for the 99 set sent

2002.559 --> 2009.12
super chat donation that flat fellow

2005.84 --> 2013.72
canada right yeah canada is

2009.12 --> 2013.7199999999998
also very trick or treatish

2032.159 --> 2038.72
okay metal slugs cockatril what

2035.76 --> 2041.12
believe that union

2038.72 --> 2044.1200000000001
with or absorption into the diet here

2041.12 --> 2044.12
absolutely

2046.159 --> 2049.76
no

2047.519 --> 2051.44
is that officially because that doesn't

2049.76 --> 2053.8390000000004
make sense to me

2051.44 --> 2056.48
i mean the first part does yeah it's

2053.839 --> 2057.679
like oh mystical union with something

2056.48 --> 2060.48
greater

2057.679 --> 2062.48
but you don't get to understand it it's

2060.48 --> 2064.56
just feelings it's just something

2062.48 --> 2065.76
amazing like you think there might

2064.56 --> 2068.399
somebody

2065.76 --> 2070.639
have god in them at some point you

2068.399 --> 2072.3199999999997
expect magical things and it kind of

2070.639 --> 2075.2000000000003
triggers

2072.32 --> 2077.9190000000003
kinds of things in the brain

2075.2 --> 2080.72
like some people get so into that

2077.919 --> 2082.879
they literally start hallucinating the

2080.72 --> 2085.2
things that they believe

2082.879 --> 2085.2
really

2085.52 --> 2088.879
but

2086.399 --> 2091.2
not through contemplation and self

2088.879 --> 2092.24
absolutely no it's actually away from

2091.2 --> 2095.1189999999997
that

2092.24 --> 2097.2799999999997
it's away from self

2095.119 --> 2101.32
and just like more like an obsession

2097.28 --> 2101.32
with the mystical thing

2102.4 --> 2106.1600000000003
right away from the self so i don't know

2104.4 --> 2110.359
where you're getting this

2106.16 --> 2110.359
contemplation and self

2119.119 --> 2124.0
knowledge inaccessible to the intellect

2121.92 --> 2125.92
spiritual apprehension

2124.0 --> 2127.04
of knowledge inaccessible to the

2125.92 --> 2130.04
intellect

2127.04 --> 2130.04
what

2139.28 --> 2143.2000000000003
so it is

2141.119 --> 2146.079
how do you get information that you

2143.2 --> 2146.0789999999997
didn't think of

2147.599 --> 2153.6800000000003
okay

2149.599 --> 2153.6800000000003
well in that case i'm a freaking mystic

2153.76 --> 2160.2400000000002
because i get almost all my information

2157.52 --> 2161.68
not by thinking about it

2160.24 --> 2165.68
but by just

2161.68 --> 2168.24
having it manifested through through me

2165.68 --> 2169.2799999999997
my brain only seems to be more like a

2168.24 --> 2173.2
vessel

2169.28 --> 2175.119
to receive it i don't feel like i

2173.2 --> 2178.7999999999997
like it's me

2175.119 --> 2181.2000000000003
i used to i used to identify my

2178.8 --> 2182.88
my even my ego with

2181.2 --> 2185.4399999999996
my intellect

2182.88 --> 2190.079
and i found out that that's actually

2185.44 --> 2190.079
counterproductive it stops my intellect

2190.72 --> 2194.48
and people absolutely do not appreciate

2193.359 --> 2197.68
it

2194.48 --> 2200.88
because everybody thinks or basically

2197.68 --> 2203.1189999999997
receives information

2200.88 --> 2205.04
and come up with the same things even

2203.119 --> 2206.6400000000003
though they have absolutely no contact

2205.04 --> 2208.4
with you

2206.64 --> 2210.0
right

2208.4 --> 2211.359
so maybe

2210.0 --> 2214.72
maybe my

2211.359 --> 2216.24
comprehension that

2214.72 --> 2219.7599999999998
ideas

2216.24 --> 2223.1189999999997
come directly from the creator from the

2219.76 --> 2226.7200000000003
master of all information

2223.119 --> 2228.88
right god big g the designer of all

2226.72 --> 2232.9599999999996
information the creator of the akashic

2228.88 --> 2235.599
library you get it handed to you

2232.96 --> 2237.28
well i guess that would be a mystical

2235.599 --> 2241.7200000000003
process

2237.28 --> 2241.7200000000003
by the oxford definition

2242.32 --> 2247.119
paypal is working oh okay i'll check it

2244.96 --> 2251.88
out could certainly use some

2247.119 --> 2251.88
i've had some costs recently

2257.52 --> 2261.04
whoa

2258.8 --> 2263.44
julio

2261.04 --> 2263.44
dude

2263.68 --> 2267.359
you

2264.8 --> 2268.7200000000003
definitely have been absolved from being

2267.359 --> 2271.839
gay

2268.72 --> 2274.0
man thank you so much that's very

2271.839 --> 2276.48
welcome

2274.0 --> 2278.8
thank you very very much

2276.48 --> 2278.8
damn

2279.44 --> 2283.2400000000002
that's awesome bro

2291.52 --> 2296.16
can go both ways well yeah gaining

2293.359 --> 2297.2799999999997
wisdom that's the whole problem like

2296.16 --> 2300.3199999999997
what

2297.28 --> 2302.1600000000003
metal slugs cockatio

2300.32 --> 2304.8
basically laid out from the oxford

2302.16 --> 2304.7999999999997
dictionary

2305.119 --> 2312.0
it is in my opinion self-contradicting

2308.4 --> 2312.96
it's like three different things

2312.0 --> 2317.64
that

2312.96 --> 2317.64
the first doesn't match the last

2337.119 --> 2340.4
so not try to be understood by the

2339.04 --> 2343.68
intellect but

2340.4 --> 2347.359
by mystical rights or other

2343.68 --> 2347.359
yeah that would make sense

2351.68 --> 2356.1189999999997
it basically means spiritual mysteries

2354.32 --> 2358.96
assumed to be

2356.119 --> 2360.4
incontemplatable incomprehensible

2358.96 --> 2363.2
by the mind

2360.4 --> 2366.1600000000003
and so not try to be understood by the

2363.2 --> 2368.56
intellect but by mystical rights and

2366.16 --> 2371.2799999999997
other practices

2368.56 --> 2374.96
right well effectively you put it on

2371.28 --> 2377.44
hold and you just trust like yeah

2374.96 --> 2380.2400000000002
it's there i don't understand it

2377.44 --> 2383.599
but it must have a function right and

2380.24 --> 2385.2799999999997
then i intellectually definitely do

2383.599 --> 2388.6400000000003
take a grasp on it

2385.28 --> 2390.88
and i have contemplated a lot

2388.64 --> 2394.3199999999997
right it's like oh i'm receiving

2390.88 --> 2395.599
something i feel this is important i

2394.32 --> 2398.88
also feel

2395.599 --> 2401.52
i cannot grasp this right now

2398.88 --> 2404.7200000000003
it brings up too many conflicts it makes

2401.52 --> 2406.0
me defend myself against it but i will

2404.72 --> 2407.68
still

2406.0 --> 2410.48
honor

2407.68 --> 2413.2799999999997
the purity of what i'm receiving

2410.48 --> 2415.359
and realize from practical experience

2413.28 --> 2417.8390000000004
practical wisdom very basic practical

2415.359 --> 2420.24
wisdom you can attain as a very young

2417.839 --> 2423.7599999999998
kid by the way if you

2420.24 --> 2427.04
have it handed down to you

2423.76 --> 2429.599
somebody tells you like you will really

2427.04 --> 2432.16
understand you will really understand

2429.599 --> 2434.0
this you will be at another place in

2432.16 --> 2435.2
your mind and your heart you will feel

2434.0 --> 2437.04
differently

2435.2 --> 2439.68
but you will remember this and

2437.04 --> 2441.92
understand don't worry about it now

2439.68 --> 2443.9199999999996
don't struggle to try to understand it

2441.92 --> 2447.76
right now because you're very unlikely

2443.92 --> 2449.599
to be able to get it it will just

2447.76 --> 2452.1600000000003
create friction

2449.599 --> 2455.6800000000003
and make you feel helpless for not being

2452.16 --> 2455.68
able to understand it right now

2460.8 --> 2465.44
right and i guess that

2463.52 --> 2466.4
in my 20s

2465.44 --> 2468.8
i

2466.4 --> 2470.48
was kind of like into wicca and all that

2468.8 --> 2473.04
and then there was a lot of it there

2470.48 --> 2475.359
were a lot of mystical processes and

2473.04 --> 2477.44
things and even dark things

2475.359 --> 2481.359
where i was just like

2477.44 --> 2483.68
why are they doing this

2481.359 --> 2486.0
why is why is it done like this what is

2483.68 --> 2488.48
the function of ritual what is the

2486.0 --> 2490.88
function of

2488.48 --> 2493.52
of these esoteric things that i didn't

2490.88 --> 2495.76
even call them esoteric then i hadn't

2493.52 --> 2497.68
caught up to that vernacular yet

2495.76 --> 2500.8
the difference between esoterics and

2497.68 --> 2503.52
exoterics didn't understand that

2500.8 --> 2505.44
so it was a mystery to me

2503.52 --> 2509.839
and i kind of like

2505.44 --> 2509.839
tried to figure it out but i couldn't

2510.079 --> 2516.079
but i definitely did not just blankly

2513.119 --> 2516.079
accept things

2519.599 --> 2524.88
it's like i will never surrender myself

2522.16 --> 2524.8799999999997
to something

2526.319 --> 2529.839
that feels

2528.56 --> 2531.92
wrong

2529.839 --> 2534.0
just because i just don't understand it

2531.92 --> 2536.88
yet

2534.0 --> 2540.48
it's like okay if it feels wrong then i

2536.88 --> 2543.44
must understand why it feels wrong or i

2540.48 --> 2546.8
cannot proceed because i might literally

2543.44 --> 2548.88
roll onto something very dark

2546.8 --> 2552.319
right

2548.88 --> 2552.319
my title is wrong no it's not

2561.599 --> 2565.119
that's my take anyway according to the

2563.119 --> 2567.599
difference yeah thank you metal slugs

2565.119 --> 2570.1600000000003
cockatio it's it's an interesting thing

2567.599 --> 2572.6400000000003
to discuss

2570.16 --> 2575.04
i've really never looked it up in a

2572.64 --> 2578.04
dictionary i have my own view on

2575.04 --> 2578.04
mysticism

2593.359 --> 2597.7599999999998
yeah gaining wisdom you're also correct

2596.0 --> 2600.16
almost all religions

2597.76 --> 2602.96
utilize mysticism

2600.16 --> 2604.48
that's right they just say oh no we have

2602.96 --> 2607.119
to do this

2604.48 --> 2610.16
this is the reason why some ridiculous

2607.119 --> 2612.0
chant that literally makes absolutely no

2610.16 --> 2614.0789999999997
sense

2612.0 --> 2616.079
and when you start to think about it and

2614.079 --> 2619.04
cross-reference it with everything else

2616.079 --> 2620.5600000000004
including the materials and sayings in

2619.04 --> 2623.44
that religion

2620.56 --> 2626.0789999999997
you will find out that that is

2623.44 --> 2628.96
completely idiotic that makes absolutely

2626.079 --> 2632.2400000000002
no sense that feels evil

2628.96 --> 2634.64
like why is this thing being

2632.24 --> 2636.9599999999996
said we have to do that

2634.64 --> 2636.96
when

2637.76 --> 2646.76
yeah like for example christ

2641.76 --> 2646.76
actually criticizes that sort of thing

2652.079 --> 2656.0
right and yeah let's get let's get to

2654.319 --> 2659.68
the title

2656.0 --> 2663.76
jesus did not die for your sins right

2659.68 --> 2665.2
that's one of these complaints i have

2663.76 --> 2667.28
every time

2665.2 --> 2671.839
christians say oh he died for your sins

2667.28 --> 2671.8390000000004
it's immediately like oh feel guilty

2673.76 --> 2679.8390000000004
feel guilty towards jesus you owe him

2676.88 --> 2682.0
because he died for your sins

2679.839 --> 2684.4
and like what does that even mean what

2682.0 --> 2686.079
are sins in order for somebody to die

2684.4 --> 2691.079
for them

2686.079 --> 2691.079
right that seems really bizarre

2691.68 --> 2698.3999999999996
like

2693.599 --> 2701.119
can someone's death take away sin

2698.4 --> 2701.119
your sin

2701.2 --> 2706.3999999999996
don't i don't think so it can take away

2703.52 --> 2708.72
their sin and maybe if you are conjoined

2706.4 --> 2710.88
in your sin with them then it will take

2708.72 --> 2712.48
yours away as well but you will still

2710.88 --> 2714.96
pay for it

2712.48 --> 2716.319
because in your life you pay for your

2714.96 --> 2718.8
sins

2716.319 --> 2720.0
so to say that somebody

2718.8 --> 2724.6400000000003
died

2720.0 --> 2724.64
for your sins is preposterous

2724.88 --> 2728.88
because that literally doesn't work that

2727.04 --> 2731.88
never works

2728.88 --> 2731.88
ever

2735.839 --> 2740.0
somebody dying doesn't take your sins

2737.68 --> 2740.0
away

2743.2 --> 2747.5989999999997
okay bye bye

2745.2 --> 2749.9199999999996
neo dude neo

2747.599 --> 2754.8
feel bad for me well maybe you should

2749.92 --> 2754.8
just feel bad for you for turning away

2755.839 --> 2760.7999999999997
and not listening not listening to

2758.079 --> 2765.76
legitimate criticism

2760.8 --> 2768.2400000000002
yeah because i respect jesus a lot

2765.76 --> 2771.0400000000004
even with all the knowledge

2768.24 --> 2773.2
like everything i know about him and

2771.04 --> 2775.04
everything that surrounds him

2773.2 --> 2776.0
if i just be honest

2775.04 --> 2780.24
i'll

2776.0 --> 2780.24
i'll have everybody turn against me

2783.119 --> 2788.6400000000003
but i still honor him because i think he

2786.24 --> 2792.319
was set up

2788.64 --> 2794.8799999999997
i think he was set up

2792.319 --> 2794.88
in ways

2795.04 --> 2802.4
he never claimed he died never

2798.48 --> 2805.599
oh parables yeah yeah that's a parable

2802.4 --> 2805.599
is not literal

2806.4 --> 2810.4
you understand it's not literal

2811.28 --> 2819.119
and everything he taught is about

2814.64 --> 2821.44
redemption and how to do it how to do it

2819.119 --> 2822.88
yourself and he even said like you can

2821.44 --> 2824.8
do this right

2822.88 --> 2827.6800000000003
that's his legacy

2824.8 --> 2829.3590000000004
not him dying

2827.68 --> 2831.839
so you could do whatever the [ __ ] you

2829.359 --> 2831.839
want

2832.8 --> 2836.6400000000003
you're still gonna pay the price for

2834.48 --> 2839.04
whatever you do

2836.64 --> 2841.68
because nobody died

2839.04 --> 2845.2799999999997
for your sins

2841.68 --> 2847.1189999999997
you have your sins you're born with that

2845.28 --> 2850.4
it's gonna happen

2847.119 --> 2853.52
and jesus's example his teachings can

2850.4 --> 2856.88
help you deal with the sins

2853.52 --> 2858.4
and minimize them take them away right

2856.88 --> 2861.119
his life

2858.4 --> 2862.8
his teachings

2861.119 --> 2864.7200000000003
not his death

2862.8 --> 2866.7200000000003
human sacrifice

2864.72 --> 2868.3999999999996
is evil

2866.72 --> 2870.7999999999997
if you're gonna say he died for your

2868.4 --> 2873.8
sins that awfully feels like human

2870.8 --> 2873.8
sacrifice

2874.319 --> 2877.2799999999997
right

2875.28 --> 2880.6400000000003
and that is on

2877.28 --> 2882.88
literally the number one

2880.64 --> 2886.5989999999997
god rule don't

2882.88 --> 2886.599
murder don't kill

2890.079 --> 2893.76
i do think he died seen evidence on both

2892.16 --> 2896.0789999999997
sides right well

2893.76 --> 2898.079
he might have died i look that's not

2896.079 --> 2900.4
even the point right

2898.079 --> 2903.52
he could have not died

2900.4 --> 2905.6800000000003
but he could have also died

2903.52 --> 2908.24
the thing is

2905.68 --> 2910.8799999999997
it's all it's all fine what is most

2908.24 --> 2915.1189999999997
important are his teachings

2910.88 --> 2919.52
and not the chant he died for your sins

2915.119 --> 2921.92
because that to me is a satanic spell

2919.52 --> 2925.2
to suggest somebody

2921.92 --> 2926.839
might die so that you can sin without

2925.2 --> 2928.64
worries is

2926.839 --> 2930.88
atrocious

2928.64 --> 2933.44
atrocious sounds

2930.88 --> 2934.4
like the cremation of care to me in a

2933.44 --> 2938.44
way

2934.4 --> 2938.44
really think about it

2945.92 --> 2950.079
yeah well julio pabin yeah there you go

2948.0 --> 2952.319
that's a promise

2950.079 --> 2954.28
it's a promise you can't give you don't

2952.319 --> 2956.839
know what happens after death you

2954.28 --> 2959.8390000000004
absolutely don't you

2956.839 --> 2961.2
absolutely don't nobody in this world

2959.839 --> 2964.48
does

2961.2 --> 2967.2
even shamans right that go in the other

2964.48 --> 2969.92
world that come through things similar

2967.2 --> 2973.04
as i do they don't know because on the

2969.92 --> 2975.2000000000003
other side you don't get that

2973.04 --> 2978.16
information

2975.2 --> 2981.2799999999997
you don't get the information

2978.16 --> 2984.96
you don't know you can never know

2981.28 --> 2986.6400000000003
never ever can you know what happens

2984.96 --> 2990.16
but what you can know

2986.64 --> 2990.16
is what happens in life

2997.2 --> 3003.2
and if you need a foresight

3000.4 --> 3005.44
if you need an idea

3003.2 --> 3005.4399999999996
that

3006.64 --> 3011.2
it's not all meaningless right the

3008.8 --> 3013.2000000000003
atheist problems like oh there is no

3011.2 --> 3015.359
life after death right yeah that's all

3013.2 --> 3017.2
super depressing and it's not good and

3015.359 --> 3018.96
healthy for your

3017.2 --> 3019.9199999999996
current actions

3018.96 --> 3023.2
so

3019.92 --> 3025.6800000000003
i personally like to believe

3023.2 --> 3029.68
there is something beyond

3025.68 --> 3031.2
it makes much more sense otherwise yeah

3029.68 --> 3032.64
it's weird

3031.2 --> 3034.64
but

3032.64 --> 3037.5989999999997
the most important thing is

3034.64 --> 3041.2799999999997
i trust the designer

3037.599 --> 3043.28
i trust him i trust that this isn't all

3041.28 --> 3046.0
for nothing that there is a purpose to

3043.28 --> 3049.599
it whether that purpose be an afterlife

3046.0 --> 3051.839
a continued life after another

3049.599 --> 3053.599
a continuation of the path in the other

3051.839 --> 3056.48
dimension in the heavens or the hells or

3053.599 --> 3057.7200000000003
whatever they might be

3056.48 --> 3062.76
or

3057.72 --> 3062.7599999999998
reassimilation with god reunification

3064.319 --> 3067.599
losing literal

3066.8 --> 3069.599
you

3067.599 --> 3071.04
maybe

3069.599 --> 3073.28
right there's all kinds of things you

3071.04 --> 3075.2799999999997
can think about it

3073.28 --> 3077.52
but i based that on the trust that the

3075.28 --> 3079.44
designer knew what he was doing and

3077.52 --> 3082.559
every time somebody questions or

3079.44 --> 3084.64
downplays the designer it's always super

3082.559 --> 3085.8390000000004
embarrassing and super wrong and that's

3084.64 --> 3088.5589999999997
why

3085.839 --> 3090.5589999999997
i hold on to my belief my personal

3088.559 --> 3092.8
belief

3090.559 --> 3094.48
that there is something

3092.8 --> 3095.6800000000003
on the other side

3094.48 --> 3099.44
and that

3095.68 --> 3101.44
my efforts beyond the direct results in

3099.44 --> 3103.599
the world and the energies in the world

3101.44 --> 3104.96
and the spiritual dimension in which i

3103.599 --> 3107.28
interact

3104.96 --> 3109.359
and have an effect that beyond that

3107.28 --> 3111.3590000000004
there is still purpose

3109.359 --> 3113.92
that's my personal belief and it has

3111.359 --> 3116.4
nothing to do with christianity

3113.92 --> 3119.8
that's pure me and god

3116.4 --> 3119.8
pure that

3135.599 --> 3139.52
who did he pray to him called father

3137.52 --> 3141.2
yeah

3139.52 --> 3143.52
right well that's another point of

3141.2 --> 3146.3999999999996
course clutch and that is like the the

3143.52 --> 3147.599
diafication of christ

3146.4 --> 3150.88
which

3147.599 --> 3154.0
i am not a big personal fan of that

3150.88 --> 3158.6400000000003
i think it's this idol worship

3154.0 --> 3159.839
which christ recommended against

3158.64 --> 3161.359
right

3159.839 --> 3163.599
that's and that's a bit of the problem

3161.359 --> 3167.2
because because of his parable talk he

3163.599 --> 3168.8
was always talking about

3167.2 --> 3172.72
when he says me

3168.8 --> 3175.44
he doesn't mean oh i am literally god

3172.72 --> 3178.24
it's like no i have it right here you

3175.44 --> 3181.44
can have it that's the thing that that

3178.24 --> 3182.7999999999997
thing that ungraspable spiritual feel

3181.44 --> 3185.599
thing

3182.8 --> 3185.599
that is the thing

3185.839 --> 3189.92
that is god is inside of you

3190.48 --> 3197.2
right not a literal oh the only son of

3194.48 --> 3198.2400000000002
god that is god at the same time and he

3197.2 --> 3200.24
died

3198.24 --> 3204.24
but he's immortal because he's a god all

3200.24 --> 3206.64
that that makes absolutely no sense

3204.24 --> 3209.2
it's a diaphication

3206.64 --> 3212.16
putting him on the pedestal right

3209.2 --> 3214.96
i don't need him to be a god

3212.16 --> 3217.44
i don't need that i need him to be

3214.96 --> 3219.599
what he is what he was

3217.44 --> 3221.28
the beautiful

3219.599 --> 3222.48
wise

3221.28 --> 3225.119
beyond

3222.48 --> 3227.28
understanding wise person

3225.119 --> 3229.599
that shared knowledge and insight with

3227.28 --> 3232.6400000000003
the world that still

3229.599 --> 3237.28
resounds to this day and has

3232.64 --> 3238.319
palpably provably shaped humanity beyond

3237.28 --> 3241.28
that

3238.319 --> 3246.0
right that is the great gift that is the

3241.28 --> 3246.0
divine gift that came through christ

3246.079 --> 3249.96
that's how i see it

3273.2 --> 3277.7599999999998
right well repent for your sin yeah

3276.4 --> 3279.92
well what does that have to do with

3277.76 --> 3283.3590000000004
christ's death exactly

3279.92 --> 3283.359
julie of heaven do you know

3284.079 --> 3288.079
nothing right it's his teachings yeah

3286.24 --> 3289.5989999999997
you have to stop it

3288.079 --> 3292.079
and then

3289.599 --> 3294.559
you'll be better and stronger and closer

3292.079 --> 3294.559
to god

3296.16 --> 3300.68
but it has nothing to do with his death

3323.68 --> 3327.44
that's right christianity is a way of

3325.44 --> 3330.64
life narrow path we walk

3327.44 --> 3332.839
it and make errors on the way

3330.64 --> 3335.7599999999998
right because it's an

3332.839 --> 3337.7599999999998
exploration it's an exploration of the

3335.76 --> 3340.0
path as you go

3337.76 --> 3340.0
right

3342.16 --> 3347.2
and you do make errors

3344.319 --> 3349.839
and the mistakes are the reward because

3347.2 --> 3351.1189999999997
you learn so much from them they shape

3349.839 --> 3352.319
you

3351.119 --> 3355.28
and if you

3352.319 --> 3357.44
are right as you make the mistakes and

3355.28 --> 3359.599
you realize the mistakes then you learn

3357.44 --> 3362.2400000000002
and you become more

3359.599 --> 3364.559
than before the mistakes

3362.24 --> 3367.5989999999997
that's why it's so important

3364.559 --> 3370.079
to not be afraid of making mistakes

3367.599 --> 3372.319
because non-engagement

3370.079 --> 3372.319
is

3372.4 --> 3375.119
a mistake

3375.2 --> 3378.72
that yields little

3385.839 --> 3389.599
living in our flesh as man we sin

3388.24 --> 3390.5589999999997
constantly

3389.599 --> 3393.839
so

3390.559 --> 3395.2000000000003
when we sin we must repent

3393.839 --> 3396.319
well

3395.2 --> 3397.2799999999997
maybe

3396.319 --> 3399.52
or

3397.28 --> 3401.76
how about just recognizing it first

3399.52 --> 3401.7599999999998
right

3403.2 --> 3407.9199999999996
that's the most important thing in my

3405.52 --> 3409.839
opinion is that you recognize it and

3407.92 --> 3412.16
then when you recognize it it's much

3409.839 --> 3414.0789999999997
easier for you to kind of like let it go

3412.16 --> 3418.5989999999997
because it's not as rewarding anymore

3414.079 --> 3418.599
when you recognize it's a sin

3421.52 --> 3425.28
right you first

3423.2 --> 3427.04
the first step and that's by the way

3425.28 --> 3428.6400000000003
counts for a whole bunch of things is

3427.04 --> 3429.52
recognition

3428.64 --> 3431.92
right

3429.52 --> 3433.52
like a drug addict that's very sil

3431.92 --> 3436.079
serious alcoholic

3433.52 --> 3438.24
right what's their main problem

3436.079 --> 3440.799
that they don't recognize it that they

3438.24 --> 3442.72
don't accept

3440.799 --> 3444.559
that they refuse the notion that they

3442.72 --> 3446.3999999999996
might have a problem

3444.559 --> 3447.599
that's the first

3446.4 --> 3450.88
step

3447.599 --> 3452.559
literally in programs well so it is with

3450.88 --> 3456.6400000000003
with sins

3452.559 --> 3458.88
you have to recognize what it is first

3456.64 --> 3462.24
and when you do that's when you can

3458.88 --> 3464.799
start to loosen up the the bonds that

3462.24 --> 3469.8799999999997
come with it

3464.799 --> 3469.88
and then eventually try to step away

3475.92 --> 3479.6800000000003
you've met people that don't learn from

3477.68 --> 3483.2
mistakes yeah well then they become the

3479.68 --> 3485.359
mistake right if you make a mistake

3483.2 --> 3487.2799999999997
you don't realize the mistake and you

3485.359 --> 3489.119
don't correct the mistake you double

3487.28 --> 3490.1600000000003
down on the mistake

3489.119 --> 3492.6400000000003
then

3490.16 --> 3494.799
the mistake becomes you

3492.64 --> 3497.1189999999997
keep on repeating it and then eventually

3494.799 --> 3500.48
you will become the mistake you will be

3497.119 --> 3502.6400000000003
associated with that mistake see

3500.48 --> 3504.4
that happens people can get stuck in

3502.64 --> 3506.96
their sin it's not a guarantee you can

3504.4 --> 3511.04
get out of everything

3506.96 --> 3511.04
it's a test it's a giant test

3515.119 --> 3518.4
hokum

3516.4 --> 3519.92
he's not nasty moon shadow stop being

3518.4 --> 3522.2400000000002
such a

3519.92 --> 3524.88
oversensitive

3522.24 --> 3526.8799999999997
person about that

3524.88 --> 3530.4
akuma virus

3526.88 --> 3533.2000000000003
deserved every word nathan gave him

3530.4 --> 3535.2000000000003
every single word

3533.2 --> 3539.04
he's a bastard

3535.2 --> 3542.0
fight kakumo virus is a sick bastard

3539.04 --> 3542.0
and a masochist

3542.88 --> 3547.44
will be caught lying

3545.28 --> 3550.88
and then just laugh about it

3547.44 --> 3550.88
he's a disgusting person

3550.96 --> 3554.559
i've been saying so for a while

3553.04 --> 3558.24
so no

3554.559 --> 3562.799
he doesn't have a nasty personality

3558.24 --> 3562.799
i mean nathan has moods sometimes

3564.96 --> 3568.68
but so do i

3579.839 --> 3585.48
oh god

3581.52 --> 3585.48
got some ballers in here

3588.72 --> 3591.52
direction

3589.92 --> 3594.88
earth oh you mean

3591.52 --> 3597.28
the presupposition of a disc orientation

3594.88 --> 3601.28
of the flat earth mr slitters thanks for

3597.28 --> 3603.0400000000004
the straw man stereotyping fallacy

3601.28 --> 3606.88
yeah

3603.04 --> 3610.799
they're celestial celestial non-physical

3606.88 --> 3613.76
things not in physical locations

3610.799 --> 3616.4
celestial lights are not physical things

3613.76 --> 3618.6400000000003
in cartesian or euclidean space they are

3616.4 --> 3620.7200000000003
holographic only

3618.64 --> 3622.16
in relation to the observer in that

3620.72 --> 3625.04
location

3622.16 --> 3627.2
they have no position nothing

3625.04 --> 3630.72
there is no

3627.2 --> 3631.9199999999996
problem with the lights being anywhere

3630.72 --> 3633.9199999999996
at all

3631.92 --> 3638.2400000000002
it would only be a problem if there was

3633.92 --> 3641.359
a a perfect inconsistency there isn't

3638.24 --> 3644.72
because they're not physical things in

3641.359 --> 3647.359
specific euclidean positions a

3644.72 --> 3649.04
perspective doesn't apply

3647.359 --> 3652.0789999999997
at all

3649.04 --> 3656.7599999999998
they don't move away their holographic

3652.079 --> 3656.76
at the edge of vision at all times

3657.52 --> 3662.079
how high is the sun it's three armenian

3659.68 --> 3662.0789999999997
units

3665.92 --> 3670.92
anger is a sin no it's not

3676.079 --> 3678.96
please point at

3679.92 --> 3683.599
the ten commandments

3681.52 --> 3685.839
show me where anger is a sin i mean

3683.599 --> 3687.2000000000003
anger is counterproductive when you act

3685.839 --> 3690.0789999999997
out on it

3687.2 --> 3690.0789999999997
a lot of the time

3691.04 --> 3696.079
you can't just make up a sin

3693.92 --> 3698.559
anger is a feeling

3696.079 --> 3699.92
it's a natural response it usually comes

3698.559 --> 3702.2400000000002
forth

3699.92 --> 3702.2400000000002
from

3702.799 --> 3708.48
holding on to principles and those can

3704.88 --> 3712.96
be good and those can be bad

3708.48 --> 3715.28
it's a social thing it's not a sin

3712.96 --> 3717.68
there's many justified reasons to get

3715.28 --> 3717.6800000000003
angry

3718.24 --> 3721.52
what is your three already

3720.079 --> 3724.1600000000003
why don't you follow the flat earth

3721.52 --> 3728.92
debates and find out i mean i've only

3724.16 --> 3728.92
been talking about that for like a year

3749.92 --> 3752.4
wrath

3751.599 --> 3754.799
right

3752.4 --> 3756.48
because because of what it does wrath is

3754.799 --> 3758.24
dangerous

3756.48 --> 3761.28
because when you are

3758.24 --> 3763.2799999999997
exerting wrath you are possessed by the

3761.28 --> 3765.039
anger

3763.28 --> 3767.92
and

3765.039 --> 3770.3190000000004
like that's in wrath moments it's very

3767.92 --> 3771.839
typical that you turn on people that are

3770.319 --> 3774.079
really your friends

3771.839 --> 3775.839
that are like really your cro close

3774.079 --> 3777.599
friends

3775.839 --> 3779.2
right you can't get angry with close

3777.599 --> 3781.28
friends but that doesn't do anything if

3779.2 --> 3784.5589999999997
you're in wrath if you're possessed by

3781.28 --> 3787.119
wrath then you tend to literally hurt

3784.559 --> 3791.119
those that love you the most

3787.119 --> 3791.119
and that you actually love them

3791.839 --> 3794.839
and they get hurt

3793.52 --> 3798.88
right and that's

3794.839 --> 3798.88
provably how it is a sin

3803.119 --> 3806.48
the ether

3804.64 --> 3809.0389999999998
what did bob nodell detect with his

3806.48 --> 3811.52
gyroscope well it's only the ring laser

3809.039 --> 3814.2400000000002
gyroscope dick

3811.52 --> 3816.079
why do you always say a gyroscope do you

3814.24 --> 3818.0789999999997
know how many different gyroscopes there

3816.079 --> 3819.3590000000004
are you know how many of them actually

3818.079 --> 3820.48
had a drift

3819.359 --> 3823.44
one

3820.48 --> 3826.319
one had a drift only the ring laser

3823.44 --> 3829.2000000000003
gyroscope the non-physical one you

3826.319 --> 3830.16
stupid baller [ __ ]

3829.2 --> 3832.72
one

3830.16 --> 3834.799
did it the others didn't not proof of

3832.72 --> 3836.9599999999996
earth spin the others would have also

3834.799 --> 3839.839
drifted they didn't

3836.96 --> 3841.28
you stupid [ __ ]

3839.839 --> 3844.319
how many times are you gonna keep

3841.28 --> 3846.4
echoing that [ __ ] like a complete

3844.319 --> 3850.48
[ __ ]

3846.4 --> 3854.319
it doesn't work you stupid idiot

3850.48 --> 3856.72
one gyroscope out of three drifted the

3854.319 --> 3860.079
non-physical one the non-physical

3856.72 --> 3862.72
mechanical one a ring laser gyro yeah

3860.079 --> 3865.599
laser deviated

3862.72 --> 3868.48
light deviated 15 degrees

3865.599 --> 3871.44
you don't even know what direction

3868.48 --> 3874.0
it doesn't prove earth spin you stupid

3871.44 --> 3874.0
idiot

3876.799 --> 3884.4
no we didn't you lying scum

3880.48 --> 3887.28
you're a lying scumbag it didn't

3884.4 --> 3889.92
you have no proof of this

3887.28 --> 3891.52
regular mechanical gyroscopes don't

3889.92 --> 3893.76
drift

3891.52 --> 3895.7599999999998
you have to like put a stupid

3893.76 --> 3896.6400000000003
machination in there to even get that

3895.76 --> 3898.6400000000003
done

3896.64 --> 3902.0
and then it's very unlikely that even

3898.64 --> 3906.16
exists you made that up you're a liar

3902.0 --> 3906.16
mr slithers and i'm gonna ban you

3906.839 --> 3912.799

3928.16 --> 3934.96
lying scumbag anti-flat earther liar

3932.559 --> 3936.559
you're a lying scumbag

3934.96 --> 3939.2

3936.559 --> 3941.92
for your stupid little fantasy belief

3939.2 --> 3941.9199999999996

3956.48 --> 3961.2
unbanned so just [ __ ] off

3958.799 --> 3965.839
don't want to see your disgusting

3961.2 --> 3965.839
icon here again you understand scumbag

3968.4 --> 3973.28
and yeah oh

3970.16 --> 3977.2799999999997
if he believes yeah if you believe in a

3973.28 --> 3979.3590000000004
lie when it is proven to you it is a lie

3977.28 --> 3984.3590000000004
yeah it's still a lie

3979.359 --> 3984.359
you understand stupid [ __ ]

4008.079 --> 4012.48
you're concerned about raising children

4010.16 --> 4015.359
in the scrub system i understand that

4012.48 --> 4015.359
it's very difficult

4016.72 --> 4020.48
but it's

4018.4 --> 4022.4
right the problem is

4020.48 --> 4024.4
it takes a long time to really

4022.4 --> 4025.92
understand the system and the corruption

4024.4 --> 4028.88
the corruption through media the

4025.92 --> 4031.92
corruption through media narratives etc

4028.88 --> 4033.52
etc right it takes time to figure that

4031.92 --> 4035.599
out

4033.52 --> 4038.72
children don't have the ability to

4035.599 --> 4041.039
completely figure that out

4038.72 --> 4043.68
they might understand and learn how to

4041.039 --> 4046.2400000000002
get about very quickly

4043.68 --> 4048.24
but moral implications and long-term

4046.24 --> 4049.7599999999998
thinking that's something they don't

4048.24 --> 4052.0
really get

4049.76 --> 4054.3190000000004
a lot of the time that's very rare for

4052.0 --> 4056.64
children to be that wise

4054.319 --> 4058.24
very very rare

4056.64 --> 4060.8799999999997
right

4058.24 --> 4063.5989999999997
so yeah i understand it's

4060.88 --> 4066.4
it's difficult but the way to do it is

4063.599 --> 4069.839
to properly

4066.4 --> 4071.839
well censor for them just check what

4069.839 --> 4073.7599999999998
they're in to

4071.839 --> 4077.52
and check if you're going to allow that

4073.76 --> 4080.48
to to them right a parent should always

4077.52 --> 4084.4
be able to forbid their child from

4080.48 --> 4084.4
engaging with things always

4085.68 --> 4090.8799999999997
they're responsible for that

4088.16 --> 4093.44
so yeah you have to keep them away from

4090.88 --> 4093.44
corruption

4093.76 --> 4101.0
and that's not always that easy and you

4096.0 --> 4101.0
must keep paying attention at all times

4130.319 --> 4134.64
you'll feel the problems there may be

4132.88 --> 4137.6
unhealthy levels of what in your

4134.64 --> 4137.6
children already

4138.159 --> 4142.239
teacher says another one they are

4139.759 --> 4144.64
conflicting okay well get them out of

4142.239 --> 4147.44
that school immediately

4144.64 --> 4149.4400000000005
what the hell you're literally letting

4147.44 --> 4152.08
your kids be taught

4149.44 --> 4153.919999999999
by somebody like that

4152.08 --> 4156.719
that's gonna teach them like gay [ __ ]

4153.92 --> 4158.839
and communism just get them out

4156.719 --> 4160.4
immediately

4158.839 --> 4163.12
immediately

4160.4 --> 4164.719
you shouldn't even have had them there

4163.12 --> 4166.4
when you check out the school for your

4164.719 --> 4170.56
kid you should check who's going to be

4166.4 --> 4170.5599999999995
teaching there who's the headmaster

4171.199 --> 4175.2789999999995
very important

4173.359 --> 4179.92
there's freaking communists in there

4175.279 --> 4179.92
just it don't let your children go there

4184.799 --> 4189.839
right and yeah homeschooling if you

4186.64 --> 4189.839
can't find any of that

4192.56 --> 4197.4400000000005
why am i giving parental advice well i'd

4195.12 --> 4199.44
like to think that i

4197.44 --> 4203.28
will be a parent too someday so i'm

4199.44 --> 4204.719
practicing ahead of time

4203.28 --> 4207.84
and besides

4204.719 --> 4209.28
i care about these things i care about

4207.84 --> 4211.1990000000005
children

4209.28 --> 4214.48
even if they're not my own

4211.199 --> 4214.48
i care about them a lot

4215.44 --> 4221.759999999999
i like it when there are children about

4218.8 --> 4222.719
and they are like happy

4221.76 --> 4224.719
and

4222.719 --> 4229.2390000000005
just not worried

4224.719 --> 4229.2390000000005
it's like a relief to see that

4237.12 --> 4244.28
oh you okay so you're the same

4240.239 --> 4244.28
right trying to plan it

4246.4 --> 4251.199
yeah that's difficult

4248.88 --> 4253.1990000000005
oh first you gotta have a wife that is

4251.199 --> 4257.04
actually willing

4253.199 --> 4257.04
right you gotta work for that

4257.44 --> 4262.5599999999995
you usually have to sacrifice some

4259.76 --> 4262.56
things for that

4264.159 --> 4267.839999999999
and

4265.44 --> 4269.44
you gotta find a home base very

4267.84 --> 4271.679
important like you gotta find a home

4269.44 --> 4274.5599999999995
base and then like feel like this is

4271.679 --> 4275.84
where the kids will grow up for like

4274.56 --> 4277.120000000001
a decade

4275.84 --> 4280.96
at least

4277.12 --> 4282.88
it's very important home stability

4280.96 --> 4286.32
they have to have a place where they can

4282.88 --> 4288.159000000001
literally have their dreams unfolded

4286.32 --> 4291.159
and rooted

4288.159 --> 4291.159
earthed

4303.44 --> 4307.919999999999
finding a female oh my god are you one

4305.52 --> 4310.64

4323.199 --> 4328.96

4326.0 --> 4331.44
literally makes them more of a woman

4328.96 --> 4334.88
literally provably

4331.44 --> 4337.28
energy changes women become more when

4334.88 --> 4339.400000000001
they become mothers

4337.28 --> 4342.08
that's a fact

4339.4 --> 4345.12
undeniable fact how [ __ ] dare you

4342.08 --> 4350.04

and sorry if i'm getting a little heated

4482.159 --> 4487.199
it's just these stupid trolls these

4484.719 --> 4491.199
[ __ ] [ __ ]

4487.199 --> 4491.199
keep spamming me it's so annoying

4492.64 --> 4496.56
the same [ __ ] over and over again that

4494.88 --> 4499.36
already addressed

4496.56 --> 4501.679
so why do they think that i literally

4499.36 --> 4504.08
unraveled everything they said that they

4501.679 --> 4506.4
thought they had something and then they

4504.08 --> 4508.96
spam the same [ __ ] over again what are

4506.4 --> 4511.36
you gonna accomplish you idiot

4508.96 --> 4516.12
you think that's gonna prove anything it

4511.36 --> 4516.12
just makes you look like an [ __ ]

4530.159 --> 4534.4
a former children as for my children we

4533.04 --> 4537.96
understand what is required for good

4534.4 --> 4537.96
parenting oh

4538.159 --> 4540.48
that's

4540.8 --> 4546.320000000001
that's not a good attitude in my opinion

4543.6 --> 4546.320000000001
no you don't

4546.8 --> 4550.52
[ __ ] off scumbag

4555.36 --> 4560.96
[ __ ] mr slitters piece of [ __ ]

4558.4 --> 4562.879999999999
yeah but yeah as former children

4560.96 --> 4564.0
understand what is good for parenting no

4562.88 --> 4565.76
you don't

4564.0 --> 4569.199
no you don't really

4565.76 --> 4569.1990000000005
because every child

4570.08 --> 4573.6
is different

4571.92 --> 4574.56
right

4573.6 --> 4577.04
you

4574.56 --> 4580.719
had certain parents they

4577.04 --> 4582.88
departed according to that generation

4580.719 --> 4584.719
it's generational thing

4582.88 --> 4588.0
you're gonna have

4584.719 --> 4589.6
issues with their choices

4588.0 --> 4591.6
naturally

4589.6 --> 4593.1990000000005
because of they're not never parents are

4591.6 --> 4594.88
never perfect

4593.199 --> 4597.199
you're going to have issues because of

4594.88 --> 4600.0
the way they parented you're going to

4597.199 --> 4602.0
say i'm going to do it like this

4600.0 --> 4603.199
or guess what's going to happen your

4602.0 --> 4604.56
children

4603.199 --> 4608.48
are going to have

4604.56 --> 4611.280000000001
issues with that side of parenting

4608.48 --> 4613.28
and they probably will feel very similar

4611.28 --> 4615.36
to your parents

4613.28 --> 4618.08
they will choose that

4615.36 --> 4621.28
because they are naturally going to have

4618.08 --> 4624.159
objections to your parenting you see so

4621.28 --> 4626.32
you can't you can't really say oh just

4624.159 --> 4627.199
because i was a kid i know how to pair

4626.32 --> 4629.759999999999
no

4627.199 --> 4631.919999999999
that's not necessarily true

4629.76 --> 4635.4400000000005
it's it's very good to understand the

4631.92 --> 4638.4800000000005
generational effect

4635.44 --> 4642.12
to really resolve that it's difficult

4638.48 --> 4642.12
it's very difficult

4652.719 --> 4659.12
that's right there is no golden rule

4655.52 --> 4663.1990000000005
every kid is a unique challenge

4659.12 --> 4666.32
but there is a generational effect

4663.199 --> 4667.919999999999
it's very simple it's very likely

4666.32 --> 4670.48
kids will be

4667.92 --> 4673.28
will have similar positions similar

4670.48 --> 4675.759999999999
spiritual vantage points as their

4673.28 --> 4679.679
grandparents

4675.76 --> 4680.8
so there's usually like two generations

4679.679 --> 4682.32
right

4680.8 --> 4683.679
grandparents

4682.32 --> 4686.88
grandchild

4683.679 --> 4688.32
parents and grand grandchild and it's

4686.88 --> 4689.4400000000005
like two

4688.32 --> 4690.4
two

4689.44 --> 4692.799999999999
two

4690.4 --> 4694.929999999999
two it's it skips

4692.8 --> 4698.009
that's usually how it works out

4694.93 --> 4698.009
[Music]

4700.96 --> 4704.6
what are you doing kitty

4706.96 --> 4711.679
staring up trouble with some crows i see

4710.32 --> 4713.759999999999
clothes are like what the hell are you

4711.679 --> 4718.12
doing here

4713.76 --> 4718.12
that's supposed to be on this roof

4731.76 --> 4735.4800000000005
he's drinking water

4740.96 --> 4745.52
i was discounting the notion that you

4743.6 --> 4749.84
need children to know

4745.52 --> 4749.84
what is required for good parenting

4754.4 --> 4757.679
well

4756.4 --> 4759.839999999999
there's that

4757.679 --> 4763.36
but you can have a natural talent and

4759.84 --> 4765.04
just be very about education and about

4763.36 --> 4767.599999999999
ascension

4765.04 --> 4770.159
i think i'd make a great parent in

4767.6 --> 4772.159000000001
certain fronts but i would have issues

4770.159 --> 4773.679
with my personal

4772.159 --> 4775.92
feelings

4773.679 --> 4778.719
that's going to be my big challenge like

4775.92 --> 4780.719
how can i stay in that role some people

4778.719 --> 4783.44
are just they get in that role and they

4780.719 --> 4786.159
never get out and they're perfect at it

4783.44 --> 4787.28
i have like a personality with issues

4786.159 --> 4789.44
that have

4787.28 --> 4791.84
haunted me in my life

4789.44 --> 4793.839999999999
they're not likely to completely go away

4791.84 --> 4796.159000000001
when i become a parent

4793.84 --> 4799.679
but when i do the parenting i think i'm

4796.159 --> 4799.679
going to be very good at it

4799.84 --> 4805.1990000000005
and other people have told me that like

4802.239 --> 4807.759999999999
wow you would make a great father

4805.199 --> 4809.599999999999
and i'm like oh really oh i didn't even

4807.76 --> 4813.96
think about it it's just

4809.6 --> 4813.96
those things come natural to me

4822.48 --> 4825.48
hmm

4834.08 --> 4837.92
oh they're trying to drive the cat out

4843.52 --> 4846.52
kitty

4857.76 --> 4861.56
leave them birds alone

4862.719 --> 4867.12
ah

4863.6 --> 4867.120000000001
thank you for the moderating clutch

4872.4 --> 4876.719
do i have any brothers or sisters

4876.88 --> 4882.08
yeah i have a half brother he does have

4879.92 --> 4887.2390000000005
kids but i don't really

4882.08 --> 4887.239
i have barely any contact

4888.32 --> 4891.92
last time i saw them they were like

4892.8 --> 4895.84
seven and five

4895.92 --> 4899.52
they should be teenagers by now

4901.679 --> 4907.1990000000005
and it is kind of like

4903.76 --> 4907.1990000000005
in a way disappointing but

4907.6 --> 4910.0
i'm just

4910.8 --> 4916.8
i don't

4912.719 --> 4918.88
i just don't have like the

4916.8 --> 4920.159000000001
the spiritual position to really act

4918.88 --> 4922.2390000000005
like an uncle

4920.159 --> 4925.839999999999
that comes by all the time

4922.239 --> 4927.12
it's like i'm very opinionated about a

4925.84 --> 4929.76
lot of things

4927.12 --> 4932.5599999999995
and i'm pretty damn sure that my brother

4929.76 --> 4935.1990000000005
is counter opposite in those opinions i

4932.56 --> 4938.159000000001
think that my brother is actually

4935.199 --> 4941.5599999999995
become more and more liberal since we

4938.159 --> 4941.5599999999995
split apart

4944.0 --> 4948.239
which is really ironic because i used to

4946.4 --> 4950.5599999999995
be the liberal one and he used to be

4948.239 --> 4952.718999999999
kind of the conservative one

4950.56 --> 4954.4800000000005
but i think he's completely moved out of

4952.719 --> 4956.96
that and that's probably also because of

4954.48 --> 4956.959999999999
his wife

4957.84 --> 4963.52
so i'm kind of worried i'm worried about

4960.48 --> 4963.5199999999995
v situations

4964.08 --> 4967.44
and i'm worried that he's like

4970.84 --> 4975.04
like gay kind of liberal

4976.56 --> 4980.639
but there's literally nothing i can do

4978.239 --> 4980.638999999999
about it

4981.84 --> 4986.400000000001
i and i don't know for sure because i

4983.679 --> 4987.92
barely talked to him i'm pretty damn

4986.4 --> 4990.08
sure he doesn't watch my show or

4987.92 --> 4994.56
anything it's like last time i talked to

4990.08 --> 4999.0
him even over the phones years ago

4994.56 --> 4999.0
but i don't know what to say to him

5003.92 --> 5007.76
liberals become liberals when they stop

5005.76 --> 5011.1990000000005
believing in god well there's the thing

5007.76 --> 5014.320000000001
my brother has always been

5011.199 --> 5017.599999999999
a hardcore atheist hardcore

5014.32 --> 5017.599999999999
like unrelenting

5020.56 --> 5024.719
so he's never

5023.199 --> 5028.599999999999
had that

5024.719 --> 5028.6
foundation of recognition

5043.04 --> 5047.199
i mean like even my mother kind of

5045.36 --> 5050.4
believed in god

5047.199 --> 5054.0
my dad definitely did my brother was

5050.4 --> 5056.799999999999
like hard core atheist and i mean like

5054.0 --> 5060.159
really hardcore like he'll get very

5056.8 --> 5060.159000000001
pissed off if you try to

5061.199 --> 5066.48
like make him consider god i don't know

5064.48 --> 5070.28
why

5066.48 --> 5070.28
never understood that

5078.719 --> 5082.84
right and i already had problems with

5080.8 --> 5084.719
him about that even

5082.84 --> 5086.719
before i

5084.719 --> 5089.199
started to walk the path

5086.719 --> 5091.36
even before that even with basic

5089.199 --> 5093.36
spiritualism he just

5091.36 --> 5095.12
looked down upon that and like you are

5093.36 --> 5097.36
an idiot

5095.12 --> 5099.84
not even like oh this is bad this reason

5097.36 --> 5101.36
that you are stupid you're stupid for

5099.84 --> 5104.4800000000005
doing that

5101.36 --> 5105.92
hardcore atheist guys anti-spiritual in

5104.48 --> 5111.32
ways

5105.92 --> 5111.32
like really no respect no none

5112.8 --> 5118.0
and like even when we've talked he just

5115.36 --> 5120.639
doesn't i don't have anything to share

5118.0 --> 5122.719
with him everything i talk about is

5120.639 --> 5126.8
always tied in with spiritual things

5122.719 --> 5130.159
always always always has been he

5126.8 --> 5133.76
just doesn't connect to that at all

5130.159 --> 5133.759999999999
and there's nothing i can do about it

5136.88 --> 5141.36
what does my brother do for a job well

5139.36 --> 5144.88
it's

5141.36 --> 5147.5199999999995
none of your business is really

5144.88 --> 5148.4800000000005
he used to be programmer i learned a lot

5147.52 --> 5150.639
from him

5148.48 --> 5152.638999999999
i don't know what he does now i think he

5150.639 --> 5154.719
he hates programming now

5152.639 --> 5156.719
i think that it's mostly

5154.719 --> 5159.679
the wife does the work

5156.719 --> 5161.6
in a laboratory which is also worrisome

5159.679 --> 5162.8
biological laboratory i don't know what

5161.6 --> 5165.360000000001
she's doing

5162.8 --> 5168.719
i hope she's not involved in this creepy

5165.36 --> 5172.5599999999995
situation i really hope not

5168.719 --> 5172.56
that would be terrifying

5173.28 --> 5178.719
but my brother from what i've gathered

5175.84 --> 5181.12
was mostly the stay up at home father

5178.719 --> 5183.6
raising the kids

5181.12 --> 5184.8
and he's pretty decent at it it's very

5183.6 --> 5187.679
caring

5184.8 --> 5189.52
he was carrying with me

5187.679 --> 5194.28
he really was my big brother always it

5189.52 --> 5194.280000000001
was very he looked out for me

5206.8 --> 5210.8
interestingly atheists still think there

5209.04 --> 5213.04
is an objective morality without an

5210.8 --> 5215.92
anchor of god well they just go with the

5213.04 --> 5218.159
god sense but they don't

5215.92 --> 5219.52
cognitively tie it in with everything

5218.159 --> 5222.719
they just like

5219.52 --> 5225.1990000000005
this feels good that feels wrong

5222.719 --> 5227.92
and then they don't consider long term a

5225.199 --> 5227.919999999999
lot of the time

5228.159 --> 5233.679
right so yeah of course you're literally

5230.4 --> 5236.239
created by god you're literally designed

5233.679 --> 5238.56
or like originally designed

5236.239 --> 5240.159
to be throughout generations to spawn

5238.56 --> 5243.04
forth

5240.159 --> 5246.239
conjure your spirit is conjured by god

5243.04 --> 5246.239
in his creation

5247.92 --> 5251.96
and you have that sense

5252.239 --> 5255.599999999999
most people have that have the god sense

5254.8 --> 5259.1990000000005
to

5255.6 --> 5259.1990000000005
figure out right from wrong

5259.679 --> 5263.6
but that sense has to be developed

5262.48 --> 5266.799999999999
and if you

5263.6 --> 5269.84
don't develop it then you can even

5266.8 --> 5272.159000000001
become like sociopathic or psychopathic

5269.84 --> 5274.400000000001
you can try to staunch it or hide it or

5272.159 --> 5276.96
you could do all kinds of things with it

5274.4 --> 5279.759999999999
if you just properly develop it then

5276.96 --> 5282.159
yeah that sense becomes

5279.76 --> 5285.92
refined morality

5282.159 --> 5285.92
but almost everybody's born with it

5286.0 --> 5290.56
psychopaths aren't born with it

5289.04 --> 5294.44
they have no

5290.56 --> 5294.4400000000005
inner feeling response

5296.56 --> 5300.56
but yeah even as an atheist you can have

5298.639 --> 5303.4400000000005
those senses

5300.56 --> 5305.92
as long as you don't actively erase them

5303.44 --> 5307.36
for some ideological purpose

5305.92 --> 5310.88
because you can do that you can

5307.36 --> 5313.199
literally just erase it from yourself

5310.88 --> 5316.400000000001
doubling down on a mistake until you no

5313.199 --> 5318.719
longer longer can see it's a mistake

5316.4 --> 5320.799999999999
you will only see it through responses

5318.719 --> 5323.8
from others and then choose to ignore

5320.8 --> 5323.8
that

5334.48 --> 5342.08
no god did not design gays

5337.04 --> 5343.6
gay is a trauma-based natural response

5342.08 --> 5348.719
it's trauma

5343.6 --> 5350.400000000001
actions it's in a way survival instinct

5348.719 --> 5354.56
right it's to

5350.4 --> 5357.36
survive in extremely brutal situations

5354.56 --> 5360.719
where you are captured and tortured and

5357.36 --> 5363.04
[ __ ] and then people become gay

5360.719 --> 5364.56
yeah it's not natural

5363.04 --> 5367.44
trauma

5364.56 --> 5370.4800000000005
and torture psychological or physical is

5367.44 --> 5373.12
not natural right it's a sin that's born

5370.48 --> 5375.44
from sin but it is technically a

5373.12 --> 5376.84
short-term survival mechanism

5375.44 --> 5380.08
like stockholm

5376.84 --> 5382.56
syndrome it's very similar it has to tie

5380.08 --> 5382.5599999999995
in with that

5389.52 --> 5394.719
nobody is literally born gay nobody

5395.04 --> 5397.92
that's a myth

5399.28 --> 5403.5199999999995
does my family know i'm a flat earther

5401.36 --> 5405.36
yes

5403.52 --> 5407.679
my dad knows

5405.36 --> 5409.839999999999
my brother

5407.679 --> 5412.0
he probably knows

5409.84 --> 5414.159000000001
i don't think he cares at all about

5412.0 --> 5416.8
those things at all like nothing about

5414.159 --> 5416.799999999999
it he cares

5418.4 --> 5424.0
so maybe he knows maybe he doesn't

5421.199 --> 5427.919999999999
maybe he knows and forgotten i've said a

5424.0 --> 5429.199
whole bunch of really intense and crazy

5427.92 --> 5432.88
things

5429.199 --> 5435.28
not incohesive but like literally crazy

5432.88 --> 5436.8
dangerous creepy things

5435.28 --> 5439.36
when i was younger

5436.8 --> 5442.320000000001
also to him

5439.36 --> 5445.199
but he never got any of it

5442.32 --> 5446.96
because he is a staunch atheist and he

5445.199 --> 5451.36
just doesn't

5446.96 --> 5451.36
it can't do anything with it anything

5451.76 --> 5454.0
so

5457.76 --> 5463.84
yeah and my dad is a flat earther too

5460.8 --> 5466.320000000001
it's not really active but he absolutely

5463.84 --> 5468.159000000001
understand dude my dad understands the

5466.32 --> 5470.639
holographic nature of the globe of the

5468.159 --> 5472.799999999999
heavens okay

5470.639 --> 5476.639
he is a flat earther

5472.8 --> 5479.12
and so is my stepmother they all get it

5476.639 --> 5481.92
but they all have complications because

5479.12 --> 5484.8
there is a whole spiritual tradition out

5481.92 --> 5487.36
there through the alternative circuit

5484.8 --> 5488.1990000000005
where planets

5487.36 --> 5491.639
are

5488.199 --> 5496.239
spiritually not physically spiritually

5491.639 --> 5498.400000000001
incorporated within the virtual space

5496.239 --> 5500.5599999999995
like these certain types of entities

5498.4 --> 5503.5199999999995
certain types of demonic entities or

5500.56 --> 5505.6
different not demonic entities out there

5503.52 --> 5506.8
that have like their own designated

5505.6 --> 5509.04
planets

5506.8 --> 5511.28
that's a thing

5509.04 --> 5513.76
it's a spiritual lore thing and it makes

5511.28 --> 5515.92
it very confusing to just think like

5513.76 --> 5519.1990000000005
wait planets doesn't exist because it

5515.92 --> 5521.52
has been used as an example

5519.199 --> 5523.199
to kind of get an oversight in that

5521.52 --> 5526.0
spiritual realm

5523.199 --> 5528.239
and i've noticed this a lot like even my

5526.0 --> 5531.6
own healer has that issue

5528.239 --> 5533.5199999999995
he finds it very confusing

5531.6 --> 5535.280000000001
when you confront them about like but

5533.52 --> 5536.56
yeah that's not real that's all just

5535.28 --> 5538.8
visual

5536.56 --> 5541.4400000000005
to me it's even less confusing because

5538.8 --> 5543.92
it actually makes a whole bun bunch of

5541.44 --> 5546.879999999999
sense to me when you do realize it's

5543.92 --> 5549.52
holographic and then the spiritual realm

5546.88 --> 5550.639
it's like yeah that actually makes more

5549.52 --> 5554.080000000001
sense

5550.639 --> 5555.28
in a non-heliocentric model system

5554.08 --> 5557.84
reality

5555.28 --> 5559.599999999999
the spiritual model makes a lot more

5557.84 --> 5561.84
sense

5559.6 --> 5564.2390000000005
when you realize that all the celestial

5561.84 --> 5566.56
lights are holographic

5564.239 --> 5569.199
but yeah people have trouble with that

5566.56 --> 5573.400000000001
they just it's confusing to them

5569.199 --> 5573.4
even smart and wise people

5578.0 --> 5584.48
what do my siblings do for a living

5581.84 --> 5586.08
well my dad is a

5584.48 --> 5589.759999999999
a healer

5586.08 --> 5591.6
like an alternative doctor

5589.76 --> 5593.280000000001
uh my brother i don't know what he's

5591.6 --> 5595.1990000000005
doing currently

5593.28 --> 5596.88
i don't know could be doing an office

5595.199 --> 5599.04
job or something i don't know what he's

5596.88 --> 5600.719
doing i literally don't but i do know

5599.04 --> 5603.92
that

5600.719 --> 5607.92
like his wife is

5603.92 --> 5611.56
like a biology labyrinth

5607.92 --> 5611.56
very prestigious

5619.12 --> 5622.5599999999995
who made the hologram

5621.84 --> 5625.1990000000005
it

5622.56 --> 5627.280000000001
nobody made it it's there it's part of

5625.199 --> 5628.5599999999995
the design it's inherent to the design

5627.28 --> 5629.84
of the realm

5628.56 --> 5632.080000000001
it happens

5629.84 --> 5634.32
if you have eyes to see

5632.08 --> 5636.159
you will receive the holographic

5634.32 --> 5638.88
celestial lights

5636.159 --> 5643.239
if there's nothing in between

5638.88 --> 5643.2390000000005
your sight and the edge of vision

5650.159 --> 5653.92
all right okay clutch see you later

5652.4 --> 5656.92
thanks for popping by thanks for the

5653.92 --> 5656.92
moderating

5665.84 --> 5670.96
how am i doing today i'm doing great

5667.36 --> 5673.599999999999
style in 80 12. you're late

5670.96 --> 5674.639
very very late what powers the hologram

5673.6 --> 5677.6
energy

5674.639 --> 5679.6
electricity that is here present

5677.6 --> 5682.08
i think the electrical ether is what

5679.6 --> 5684.719
powers the hologram

5682.08 --> 5687.36
it's just energy hanging in the air

5684.719 --> 5689.44
and then it holographically manifests

5687.36 --> 5690.48
light

5689.44 --> 5693.919999999999
with

5690.48 --> 5696.32
yeah for those who have eyes or cameras

5693.92 --> 5698.8
for those who have the design

5696.32 --> 5701.36
to receive

5698.8 --> 5702.88
the celestial holographic light that is

5701.36 --> 5705.759999999999
ever present

5702.88 --> 5705.76
it's everywhere

5708.88 --> 5713.2390000000005
is my family wealthy no

5714.96 --> 5718.32
middle class at best

5723.84 --> 5727.679
are the stars less visible the higher

5725.76 --> 5729.04
altitude you go yeah so i've heard

5727.679 --> 5730.56
theodore olo

5729.04 --> 5732.32
go witch

5730.56 --> 5735.04
a leg of each

5732.32 --> 5737.28
yeah it seems like the celestial lights

5735.04 --> 5738.88
and not just the stars

5737.28 --> 5740.08
the others too

5738.88 --> 5743.28
that they

5740.08 --> 5744.239
just become different when you go higher

5743.28 --> 5746.719
up

5744.239 --> 5748.0
i have i don't have too much information

5746.719 --> 5751.04
on it though

5748.0 --> 5753.119
but it's already a staunch indicator

5751.04 --> 5755.36
that they are holographic because if

5753.119 --> 5758.08
there are literal lights in positions

5755.36 --> 5760.799999999999
shining from that position towards you

5758.08 --> 5762.8
the observer then as you approach them

5760.8 --> 5766.400000000001
they wouldn't just disappear that makes

5762.8 --> 5769.119000000001
no freaking sense whatsoever

5766.4 --> 5771.839999999999
you would see them better instead

5769.119 --> 5771.839999999999
and you don't

5774.159 --> 5779.32
alright starting 8012 hope everything is

5776.239 --> 5779.32
all right

5786.0 --> 5789.52
can wheelers power the what

5794.159 --> 5798.719
stars more visible oh do you have any

5796.159 --> 5801.36
proof for that rosemary and thyme

5798.719 --> 5805.28
because i don't think so

5801.36 --> 5805.28
there's no evidence of that whatsoever

5805.36 --> 5813.92
oh thank you theodore olo olegovic

5809.679 --> 5813.92
for becoming a member appreciate it

5814.159 --> 5816.638999999999
welcome

5821.119 --> 5824.4
oh god this cat

5825.199 --> 5829.759999999999
i gotta feed him something or he just

5827.04 --> 5832.76
keeps on walking back and forth wanting

5829.76 --> 5832.76
attention

5844.04 --> 5847.76
observatories are built in mountainous

5846.32 --> 5849.36
areas

5847.76 --> 5851.4400000000005
yeah

5849.36 --> 5854.239
well observatories

5851.44 --> 5855.36
those telescopes are not really the

5854.239 --> 5859.199
regular

5855.36 --> 5859.199
type of eye setups are they

5861.92 --> 5868.56
right and besides my mountain height

5866.08 --> 5871.6
is not exactly the height where stars

5868.56 --> 5873.6
disappear you have to go up higher

5871.6 --> 5876.2390000000005
like it is not the normal heights where

5873.6 --> 5877.84
the stars disappear

5876.239 --> 5880.0
right you have to go up pretty high

5877.84 --> 5881.679
before that happens

5880.0 --> 5883.92
mountain height

5881.679 --> 5886.8
does kind of like uh

5883.92 --> 5890.56
decrease the air pressure

5886.8 --> 5890.56
so i guess that does help

5890.88 --> 5894.88
to get a clearer view

5892.8 --> 5899.52
but when you go up even higher then

5894.88 --> 5899.52
there is no stars it just goes away

5901.44 --> 5907.32
stars don't dis yeah they do

5903.84 --> 5907.32
yeah they do

5910.96 --> 5914.96
or

5911.84 --> 5917.360000000001
let's just say it differently

5914.96 --> 5919.6
what we get to see disproves

5917.36 --> 5921.839999999999
heliocentrism right

5919.6 --> 5923.679
because when you go in an area where

5921.84 --> 5924.4800000000005
there is daylight where there is the sun

5923.679 --> 5927.119
around

5924.48 --> 5929.44
you go up really high it gets all black

5927.119 --> 5931.36
up there remember but you don't get to

5929.44 --> 5934.4
see any stars

5931.36 --> 5936.4
you don't see stars

5934.4 --> 5939.199
they should be there because aren't we

5936.4 --> 5942.32
supposed to be surrounded by stars from

5939.199 --> 5944.48
all sides at all time and it's only

5942.32 --> 5947.5199999999995
the day light that kind of drowns it

5944.48 --> 5949.839999999999
away you don't see it anymore well why

5947.52 --> 5952.719
do you still not see any stars

5949.84 --> 5955.52
whatsoever when you go up

5952.719 --> 5956.639
really high start to see the black above

5955.52 --> 5957.92
you

5956.639 --> 5959.84
right

5957.92 --> 5962.4800000000005
and there's no stars

5959.84 --> 5965.119000000001
that makes no sense

5962.48 --> 5967.04
makes no sense

5965.119 --> 5968.799999999999
right now

5967.04 --> 5971.04
if we're talking about

5968.8 --> 5973.360000000001
night time and you do see the stars then

5971.04 --> 5976.0
maybe if you go up really high you still

5973.36 --> 5978.48
see them i don't know i've never even

5976.0 --> 5981.84
seen footage of that maybe

5978.48 --> 5981.839999999999
you would still see them

5981.92 --> 5985.92
but none of this

5983.36 --> 5988.0
has any direct

5985.92 --> 5989.92
correlation even with heliocentrism

5988.0 --> 5992.719
because yeah in heliocentrism you're

5989.92 --> 5994.8
surrounded by stars everywhere and you

5992.719 --> 5996.32
only supposedly don't see them because

5994.8 --> 5998.400000000001
of the daylight

5996.32 --> 5999.84
so if you then go up high during

5998.4 --> 6002.239
daylight

5999.84 --> 6006.84
starts to become black and you don't see

6002.239 --> 6008.4
stars makes no freaking sense at all at

6006.84 --> 6010.4800000000005
all

6008.4 --> 6012.48
it makes even less sense if you go up

6010.48 --> 6015.44
during night time and you'd still see

6012.48 --> 6017.599999999999
the stars then why don't you see any in

6015.44 --> 6019.5199999999995
the black

6017.6 --> 6021.04
during the daytime

6019.52 --> 6023.4400000000005
ascension

6021.04 --> 6027.199
makes no sense at all

6023.44 --> 6027.199
you know it doesn't make any sense

6029.6 --> 6032.88
you will not see stars if the sun is in

6031.84 --> 6035.88
your view

6032.88 --> 6035.88
[ __ ]

6036.08 --> 6038.639
[ __ ]

6040.159 --> 6042.96
that's

6041.199 --> 6045.599999999999
just nonsense

6042.96 --> 6047.52
you still see venus

6045.6 --> 6048.719
during daytime you see those other

6047.52 --> 6050.719
things

6048.719 --> 6053.28
why wouldn't you see that

6050.719 --> 6056.639
oh i'm an idiot okay well get the [ __ ]

6053.28 --> 6056.639
out of here then piece of [ __ ]

6061.04 --> 6065.84
right moonshadow okay yeah that's weird

6062.96 --> 6067.76
then so you see

6065.84 --> 6069.679
stars even high up

6067.76 --> 6071.76
when you do it at night

6069.679 --> 6074.159
but you don't see it when you do it at

6071.76 --> 6074.159000000001
the day

6074.4 --> 6077.638999999999
it's weird

6110.56 --> 6115.1990000000005
wow really

6112.0 --> 6117.76
your cousin steamy traveler that's weird

6115.199 --> 6120.638999999999
cousin's a ham radio operator says long

6117.76 --> 6122.8
distance ham radio improves when the sun

6120.639 --> 6125.28
has more sunspots

6122.8 --> 6125.28
wow

6125.44 --> 6127.839999999999
why

6128.0 --> 6130.96
i don't know sounds like one hell of a

6129.92 --> 6134.92
mystery

6130.96 --> 6134.92
very interesting though

6135.36 --> 6140.159
did he actually provide some

6137.36 --> 6142.239
proof of that of just something that he

6140.159 --> 6145.239
thinks

6142.239 --> 6145.239
weird

6154.8 --> 6158.08
reminds me of apollo astronauts failing

6156.639 --> 6159.6
to keep their story straight if they

6158.08 --> 6163.5199999999995
could see stars or not yeah yeah

6159.6 --> 6165.6
snowbirds but it was extremely confusing

6163.52 --> 6168.320000000001
it still is confusing right how are you

6165.6 --> 6170.8
going to translate that to heliocentrism

6168.32 --> 6173.44
like oh you go up during the day you see

6170.8 --> 6175.76
no stars it's just black oh but then

6173.44 --> 6177.599999999999
nights and then you do see stars so it's

6175.76 --> 6180.96
like oh

6177.6 --> 6183.84
up there oh you see stars because it's

6180.96 --> 6186.32
night on this side of earth oh wait now

6183.84 --> 6188.159000000001
you don't see stars it's they apparently

6186.32 --> 6190.639
what what

6188.159 --> 6193.96
yeah very confusing

6190.639 --> 6193.96
very confusing

6210.56 --> 6217.080000000001
right

6212.639 --> 6217.08
i think i'm gonna round out the show

6218.639 --> 6221.92
and feed that cat

6229.28 --> 6233.719
so yeah it's been an interesting show

6237.679 --> 6242.88
the trolls were not able to stop me

6240.639 --> 6246.76
or break my mood

6242.88 --> 6246.76
yeah a little bit of yelling

6247.04 --> 6252.719
yeah they deserve it

6250.08 --> 6254.5599999999995
right so thanks everyone for coming i

6252.719 --> 6256.56
hope you like this show

rogens it up

6258.159 --> 6261.28
and yeah

6259.28 --> 6266.5599999999995
it's like oh no

6261.28 --> 6268.5599999999995
75 down votes oh no 76 oh

6266.56 --> 6271.52
oh so bad

6268.56 --> 6273.360000000001
oh like it means anything oh you can

it doesn't matter

6282.48 --> 6289.839999999999
a vote is a vote it means attention it

6286.0 --> 6293.28
means i got viewers your down votes mean

6289.84 --> 6295.4400000000005
i got viewers you stupid [ __ ]

6293.28 --> 6297.28
