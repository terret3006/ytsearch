103.36 --> 107.68
still yeah just these little fluffy

105.28 --> 107.68
clouds

108.079 --> 110.63999999999999
it's been

112.84 --> 117.52000000000001
warm

115.04 --> 120.32000000000001
and yeah i'm getting a little dreamy

117.52 --> 120.32
because of the heat

123.36 --> 127.6
stayed up a little late last night by

127.68 --> 132.399
i accident know time is slipping by with

129.759 --> 132.39899999999997
this heat

132.64 --> 139.599
hello clutch bear first in chat

136.4 --> 143.52
milking goats no no don't milk goats

139.599 --> 146.319
don't think goat milking happens

143.52 --> 146.87900000000002
around this time now i'm just late

146.319 --> 157.51899999999998
because

146.879 --> 160.39999999999998
time slipped by

157.519 --> 160.4
and i got caught

161.28 --> 165.04
re-watching owen benjamin's stream again

163.76 --> 171.12
i've yeah i've been

165.04 --> 175.599
listening to that yesterday

171.12 --> 179.20000000000002
over at bitchute

175.599 --> 184.0
yeah the whole panda thing

179.2 --> 186.959
uh it kind of triggered me

184.0 --> 188.48
like it was really freaky i had some

186.959 --> 191.84
memories

188.48 --> 195.2
it's not even dark world memories

191.84 --> 197.28
that yeah caught up on me when i watched

195.2 --> 200.23899999999998
that

197.28 --> 201.04
and been a little weird about that about

200.239 --> 204.31900000000002
the pandas

201.04 --> 207.28
yeah well you know why because it's been

204.319 --> 209.51899999999998
told to me before

207.28 --> 209.519
and

211.599 --> 216.56
for some reason i find it almost kind of

215.36 --> 219.92000000000002
like heart-wrenching

216.56 --> 223.12
like i i never really

219.92 --> 226.39999999999998
went to deep in it at the time

223.12 --> 228.4
i just thought like why and just

226.4 --> 230.64000000000001
thought it was mean spirited but i

228.4 --> 234.159
didn't even really

230.64 --> 237.439
want to believe it it's because i guess

234.159 --> 240.56
it's like a little boy sentiment

237.439 --> 242.4
and i got some like ideas about it even

240.56 --> 244.64000000000001
because of that

242.4 --> 246.959
it's it's because when i was a little

244.64 --> 247.51899999999998
kid i really liked bears i had a teddy

246.959 --> 249.76
bear

247.519 --> 252.0
and i just thought like pandas are so

249.76 --> 253.67999999999998
cute and innocent

252.0 --> 255.36
and i like them because of that even

253.68 --> 258.639
though that makes them

255.36 --> 260.23900000000003
really unnatural

258.639 --> 262.96000000000004
and that's kind of the reason why i

260.239 --> 265.59999999999997
didn't didn't like the idea because i

262.96 --> 266.08
liked pandas i like there to be this

265.6 --> 269.04
cute

266.08 --> 269.68
fuzzy teddy bear animal even though it

269.04 --> 272.8
is

269.68 --> 272.8
probably literally

273.12 --> 276.32
people in costumes

277.6 --> 281.759
right and i think it comes indeed like

279.759 --> 284.32
oh benjamin laid it down pretty

281.759 --> 284.32
detailed

286.0 --> 289.759
like in the 19th century they probably

289.36 --> 293.04
did

289.759 --> 296.8
fake a whole bunch of animals

293.04 --> 299.04
as in stage props that they kept

296.8 --> 299.91900000000004
a secret from the public right to get

299.04 --> 303.6
people's interest

299.919 --> 305.52
and i think that the panda was like a

303.6 --> 308.639
surprising success

305.52 --> 311.59999999999997
among the the theatrics

308.639 --> 313.68
people were probably like brought in get

311.6 --> 315.68
to watch it all and they were like

313.68 --> 318.88
oh i like this one no i don't like that

315.68 --> 321.44
one like it's ugly or it's stupid

318.88 --> 322.8
just like people you have responses and

321.44 --> 325.199
i think that the panda

322.8 --> 328.88
caught a whole lot of sympathy in its

325.199 --> 328.88
act and that's why they kept it

329.199 --> 333.6
because of that weird teddy bear

332.16 --> 337.759
sensation like thing

333.6 --> 340.8
right and i think that's why

337.759 --> 344.32
it's been elevated to all these things

340.8 --> 344.32
and kept around as a trick

345.84 --> 349.28
and yeah it's quite a trip

351.12 --> 355.44
it's funny because somebody in chat

352.8 --> 358.639
dropped it too yesterday i think

355.44 --> 361.44
just sparingly mentioning it but didn't

358.639 --> 364.479
catch my attention then

361.44 --> 367.52
but it has now and it's kind of freaky

364.479 --> 371.12
to realize that there were

367.52 --> 374.24
other people that knew that like

371.12 --> 374.24
15 years ago

379.28 --> 386.08
and that i was kind of like i guess too

382.319 --> 388.47900000000004
weak to be able to to handle that

386.08 --> 395.84
it's really bizarre to realize that and

388.479 --> 395.84
after retrospect

405.6 --> 412.8
yeah weird isn't it

409.599 --> 423.84
so yeah how are you doing it's monday i

412.8 --> 423.84000000000003
am late

434.56 --> 439.919
yeah nathan uh put up this mirroring

438.16 --> 443.12
challenge all the world's a stage and a

439.919 --> 446.0
whole bunch of people have uploaded it

443.12 --> 446.0
mark sergeant

446.96 --> 452.23999999999995
i noticed uploaded it brian's logic

452.72 --> 455.759
quantum eraser

456.4 --> 465.84
it is a really good video

466.16 --> 469.91900000000004
you're moving tomorrow clutch bear

473.599 --> 479.84
anyway i got a illuminati castle

499.759 --> 521.839
a seeking star water good to see you

507.039 --> 521.8389999999999
oh nice clutch bear hmm

532.839 --> 537.9200000000001
so

535.519 --> 541.04
right so the jaw situation is pretty

537.92 --> 541.04
much as i predicted

541.2 --> 544.32
the pressure's died down it's kind of

543.12 --> 547.68
subtle

544.32 --> 550.8000000000001
but it's still raw it's still

547.68 --> 550.8
i have to still be careful

559.519 --> 566.72
but yeah i can i can eat

562.8 --> 568.8
and i can drink tea i'm pretty sure that

566.72 --> 570.1600000000001
tomorrow or the day after it's probably

568.8 --> 577.8389999999999
completely gone

570.16 --> 577.8389999999999
hey rasta hat good to see you

587.279 --> 591.8389999999999
right oh by the way

592.16 --> 596.399
not only joe rogan is a hairless panda

594.64 --> 599.04
but ranty could be considered

596.399 --> 599.04
one as well

599.519 --> 609.519
you might have played a panda

604.88 --> 609.519
or maybe that's still on his to-do list

610.8 --> 614.0
uh hey pat v

616.16 --> 633.8389999999999
ah clutch man that sounds really awesome

636.16 --> 647.8389999999999
love casaus

650.56 --> 655.1199999999999
i'm gonna take out my sandals i'm really

653.36 --> 659.6
glad i have them

655.12 --> 675.839
because yeah my my boots

659.6 --> 675.839
just way too hot with this weather

675.92 --> 680.64
you had bees they are beyond amazing the

679.04 --> 684.3199999999999
bees are awesome

680.64 --> 688.0
like i keep a little like a

684.32 --> 689.839
would be nest

688.0 --> 691.839
and yeah there's one in there right now

689.839 --> 694.8800000000001
so

691.839 --> 697.44
in my own way i i have bees too but it's

694.88 --> 703.8389999999999
not really like a beehive

697.44 --> 703.839
or like for solitary bees typical

727.52 --> 731.8389999999999
[Music]

728.839 --> 731.839
hmm

759.23 --> 762.35
[Music]

770.56 --> 775.04
i live for a month oh that's not very

773.519 --> 777.44
long

775.04 --> 777.4399999999999
really

784.839 --> 787.839
hmm

798.839 --> 801.839
hmm

809.04 --> 815.5999999999999
right so i may seem a little retractive

813.92 --> 818.88
it's really because just this whole

815.6 --> 818.88
situation is like

822.399 --> 826.839
just these doors open and i'm just

824.56 --> 829.8389999999999
gazing at it all

826.839 --> 829.839
again

832.399 --> 835.68
it's just so weird to realize that like

835.36 --> 839.44
it

835.68 --> 839.4399999999999
it had been told to me before

840.839 --> 846.8800000000001
and that even at the time i recognized

844.48 --> 850.16
like yeah that could be but i just

846.88 --> 853.04
didn't want that to be

850.16 --> 856.88
real so i forgot about it and i'm kind

853.04 --> 859.12
of embarrassed about that

856.88 --> 862.48
also just the entire context with these

859.12 --> 865.839
people that told me

862.48 --> 865.839
it just unnerved me

868.56 --> 885.8389999999999
so it's really weird getting confronted

870.32 --> 885.839
with that again

891.79 --> 894.9599999999999
[Music]

897.76 --> 900.079
hmm

907.92 --> 913.8389999999999
really do bees really only live a month

913.84 --> 918.21
[Music]

918.24 --> 923.36
oh wow you're right

925.44 --> 931.1990000000001
28 days it says on a quick search

938.839 --> 941.839
huh

943.56 --> 947.01
[Music]

994.839 --> 997.839
uh

999.44 --> 1002.5600000000001
all right yeah i watched back

1001.199 --> 1006.079
yesterday's show

1002.56 --> 1010.7199999999999
half of it and it was good

1006.079 --> 1013.04
i watched back yesterday uh

1010.72 --> 1014.72
sometimes sundays can be really kind of

1013.04 --> 1018.24
vacant

1014.72 --> 1024.079
with streams but yeah still

1018.24 --> 1026.319
it was really nice weather

1024.079 --> 1027.28
and it can be really awesome to like

1026.319 --> 1031.36
have this roof

1027.28 --> 1031.36
available especially in the evening

1031.6 --> 1035.76
because then it cools up a little

1035.839 --> 1039.1989999999998
but there's still sun like available

1038.799 --> 1042.48
there

1039.199 --> 1043.76
on that specific height so i can really

1042.48 --> 1047.439
enjoy like evening

1043.76 --> 1047.439
sun there it's very nice

1048.3 --> 1053.84
[Music]

1050.84 --> 1053.84
huh

1056.72 --> 1060.08
hey stallion 8012

1063.2 --> 1070.16
butterfly only 24 hours

1067.28 --> 1072.96
i know fruit flies only live for 24

1070.16 --> 1072.96
hours or so

1077.12 --> 1081.28
not sure about the butterfly that's a v

1079.44 --> 1085.6000000000001
well maybe in its butterfly

1081.28 --> 1090.08
form it only lives 24 hours but yeah the

1085.6 --> 1090.08
butterflies have multiple stages

1093.52 --> 1097.679
that seems a little short to do all the

1095.76 --> 1101.679
transformations in

1097.679 --> 1103.76
from egg to larva to cocoon to butterfly

1101.679 --> 1107.44
all in 24 hours that seems

1103.76 --> 1109.36
very rushed and unlikely but maybe in

1107.44 --> 1112.64
their butterfly form

1109.36 --> 1123.84
24 hours i guess could be possible maybe

1112.64 --> 1123.8400000000001
some kind of tropical butterfly

1130.96 --> 1133.28
whoa

1134.16 --> 1139.44
monarch butterfly huh what's that

1146.559 --> 1151.84
all right

1162.84 --> 1165.84
so

1167.2 --> 1169.52
these

1170.4 --> 1173.76
yeah those are pretty awesome didn't

1173.2 --> 1177.1200000000001
know they

1173.76 --> 1179.84
fly they flew that far

1177.12 --> 1179.84
interesting

1182.03 --> 1185.27
[Music]

1205.039 --> 1212.72
what make honey from rotten flesh

1208.72 --> 1212.72
what okay

1214.24 --> 1221.84
that's a little creepy

1268.159 --> 1278.3200000000002
can't find anything about that

1276.159 --> 1279.919
there's a whole bunch of description

1278.32 --> 1284.08
about it

1279.919 --> 1288.3200000000002
over at wikipedia but i didn't see it

1284.08 --> 1288.32
oh vulture was another creature okay

1288.84 --> 1295.36

hmm yeah clutch bear

1335.44 --> 1339.1200000000001
no i appreciate that too and i

1337.36 --> 1340.6399999999999
appreciate that there's other people

1339.12 --> 1343.76
that

1340.64 --> 1346.88
bring up those types of things like

1343.76 --> 1347.6
i like nature stuff and especially about

1346.88 --> 1349.7600000000002
just

1347.6 --> 1351.4399999999998
cultivation of nature in a proper way

1349.76 --> 1353.919
and all that

1351.44 --> 1354.799
like animals and insects are very

1353.919 --> 1358.8400000000001
interesting

1354.799 --> 1360.8799999999999
plants you can get from them medicinal

1358.84 --> 1363.52
qualities

1360.88 --> 1364.159
and also like spirit interactions with

1363.52 --> 1369.36
all that

1364.159 --> 1369.3600000000001
right i'm also very interested in that

1369.6 --> 1377.9189999999999
and sometimes yeah physics mechanics

1373.84 --> 1381.52
mechanics too programming to

1377.919 --> 1382.7990000000002
engineering especially engineering

1381.52 --> 1385.44
concerning certain

1382.799 --> 1385.44
machines

1387.28 --> 1391.9189999999999
yeah so whatever comes up

1393.2 --> 1403.3600000000001

1396.24 --> 1406.159
flat earth

1403.36 --> 1408.6399999999999
but i'll leave that for the flat earth

1406.159 --> 1408.64
debates

1410.799 --> 1417.84
unless somebody brings it up right here

1414.08 --> 1417.84

1481.36 --> 1490.7199999999998

1487.6 --> 1490.7199999999998
the background again

1491.919 --> 1495.1200000000001

young is it still dreary

1519.44 --> 1529.8400000000001
or has have things cleared up a little

1540.84 --> 1543.84
so

1554.84 --> 1557.84
so

1568.84 --> 1574.6399999999999
so

1571.44 --> 1576.88
ah the sun is out ah so it's gonna be

1574.64 --> 1576.88
hot

1577.2 --> 1579.52
nice

1581.76 --> 1587.2
all right adam yeah

1585.039 --> 1589.36
it's it's really awesome over here too

1587.2 --> 1589.3600000000001
and

1592.96 --> 1598.799
like it's astounding the amount of bees

1596.24 --> 1604.48
that are just going about constantly

1598.799 --> 1604.48
oh great some one just entered my room

1608.08 --> 1613.84
what the hell are you doing there

1620.18 --> 1624.159
[Music]

1622.24 --> 1627.84
he seems to be very interested in

1624.159 --> 1627.8400000000001
hanging around back there

1652.84 --> 1669.84
uh

1654.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
why what are you looking for

1678.0 --> 1683.84
ah hello tomoni rogan must have a big

1681.039 --> 1683.84
chinese audience

1685.039 --> 1689.039
all the light from the sun comes from a

1687.44 --> 1694.0
single point

1689.039 --> 1697.84
right well only to the observer

1694.0 --> 1697.84
oh great

1700.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
right so for each observer that is true

1705.279 --> 1711.84
but yeah there's no unity in this

1715.84 --> 1725.84
it's not uniform for everybody and no

1718.48 --> 1725.84
non observers

1740.08 --> 1753.84
okay just sit there and shut up

1754.799 --> 1758.96
insects are colorblind well look amanda

1758.48 --> 1761.1200000000001
young

1758.96 --> 1766.279
like even insects have all kinds of

1761.12 --> 1769.84
senses not just eyes

1766.279 --> 1769.84
electromagnetic sensors

1773.44 --> 1775.8400000000001
and

1776.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
yeah and more

1788.13 --> 1791.279
[Music]

1820.84 --> 1823.84
uh

1847.279 --> 1851.84
space is a secret entrance to a

1849.76 --> 1854.96
country's printing press okay that's an

1851.84 --> 1854.9599999999998
interesting way to put it

1855.52 --> 1865.84
z richington

1888.18 --> 1891.499
[Music]

1891.76 --> 1894.0
oh

1894.96 --> 1900.48
oh he's almost at a thousand

1896.96 --> 1904.96
[Music]

1900.48 --> 1908.24
that's cool yeah subscribe to flat side

1904.96 --> 1913.279
he's pretty cool

1908.24 --> 1913.279
i think he he actually does have 1k subs

1918.84 --> 1921.84
now

1934.55 --> 1937.69
[Music]

1943.76 --> 1949.84
you need subs man that well then you

1945.679 --> 1949.8400000000001
gotta have a channel

1966.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
cam loops that place

1977.6 --> 1991.84
take it in canada

2012.559 --> 2015.9189999999999
that's a pretty weird name for a town by

2014.72 --> 2019.44
the way where

2015.919 --> 2033.1200000000001
how was that established that name

2019.44 --> 2036.0
clutch bear do you know

2033.12 --> 2036.0
oh australia

2042.96 --> 2046.72
right sorry for mixing it up i don't

2044.64 --> 2049.839
know man i'm not too

2046.72 --> 2054.399
familiar with like the uh

2049.839 --> 2054.399
topography of canada and australia

2057.119 --> 2062.0
that topography especially with the

2060.32 --> 2064.7200000000003
netherlands

2062.0 --> 2065.679
a surprising amount with america due to

2064.72 --> 2069.1189999999997
exposure

2065.679 --> 2070.0
and some of england too but outside of

2069.119 --> 2072.2400000000002
that

2070.0 --> 2075.599
yeah maybe because of experience from

2072.24 --> 2080.3199999999997
traveling a little about france

2075.599 --> 2083.04
parts of spain and that's pretty much it

2080.32 --> 2089.839
for the rest my topography knowledge is

2083.04 --> 2089.839
not very good

2090.0 --> 2093.119
oh it is canada

2094.56 --> 2096.879
right

2099.44 --> 2104.8
it would be interesting you know like

2102.079 --> 2108.1600000000003
with those names

2104.8 --> 2111.119
like names aren't just picked randomly

2108.16 --> 2112.0789999999997
or if they are then it is even like

2111.119 --> 2115.359
noted how

2112.079 --> 2118.48
they came to it if it was sort of random

2115.359 --> 2119.5989999999997
like named after a weird thing that

2118.48 --> 2123.04
happened or

2119.599 --> 2125.599
figure mascot or whatever they will

2123.04 --> 2125.599
mention it

2126.48 --> 2134.64
shoes swap indians

2131.359 --> 2134.64
where two rivers meet

2142.839 --> 2145.839
huh

2171.39 --> 2174.5299999999997
[Music]

2184.839 --> 2187.839
so

2192.88 --> 2196.96
frenchies on the other side of the

2194.56 --> 2196.96
country

2198.839 --> 2201.839
huh

2204.96 --> 2210.7200000000003
which side is that like is there really

2208.48 --> 2213.04
like a french side in an english

2210.72 --> 2213.04
side

2213.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
in canada i have no idea i thought it

2216.079 --> 2229.8390000000004
was kind of like mixed up

2240.72 --> 2244.24
quebec is french right but i don't

2243.44 --> 2246.7200000000003
really know

2244.24 --> 2248.4799999999996
the topography right so i don't know

2246.72 --> 2252.72
where

2248.48 --> 2252.72
these cities exactly are placed

2252.8 --> 2259.09
i could probably just look it up

2257.28 --> 2262.1290000000004
why not

2259.09 --> 2262.1290000000004
[Music]

2264.079 --> 2266.48
all right

2267.359 --> 2273.2
okay yeah i subscribe to you now to

2270.4 --> 2273.2000000000003
amanda young

2275.359 --> 2279.44
oh you do actually have a couple of

2276.96 --> 2279.44
videos

2296.839 --> 2302.88
wow oh by the way youtube

2300.0 --> 2303.92
literally tried to suggest a correction

2302.88 --> 2307.28
of your name

2303.92 --> 2309.6800000000003
without an h and a young with an o

2307.28 --> 2310.8
like even though you did pop up at the

2309.68 --> 2313.839
first thing so

2310.8 --> 2313.8390000000004
but very typical

2320.86 --> 2324.01
[Applause]

2326.0 --> 2341.839
oh grace

2366.839 --> 2369.839
hmm

2374.32 --> 2387.119
okay not too straightforward

2383.44 --> 2387.119
so i guess that

2387.2 --> 2393.2
the south east side is mostly the

2390.32 --> 2393.2000000000003
british side

2395.359 --> 2400.24
and that pretty much everything

2396.88 --> 2400.2400000000002
surrounding that huge

2400.48 --> 2405.04
lake thing what's it called

2405.68 --> 2411.839
that's all kind of french

2416.0 --> 2422.56
oh god i hate that

2419.119 --> 2426.2400000000002
stupid agreement blah blah no

2422.56 --> 2426.24
just to show the freaking thing

2433.28 --> 2439.8390000000004
i might be wrong by the way with my

2436.839 --> 2439.839
assessment

2440.319 --> 2446.56
huh okay this map shows something else

2444.319 --> 2453.839
like

2446.56 --> 2453.839
what german

2456.48 --> 2463.599
what the hell

2459.52 --> 2467.359
chinese okay this is

2463.599 --> 2470.7200000000003
something else i think like every map

2467.359 --> 2474.7999999999997
about anything concerning canada just

2470.72 --> 2474.7999999999997
popped up in the search

2479.68 --> 2485.359
let's see what you guys oh tony whitcomb

2482.64 --> 2485.359
holy [ __ ]

2504.88 --> 2510.96
sending paypal donations

2508.8 --> 2512.48
it's a big gesture though it's nice to

2510.96 --> 2516.8
see those numbers come by

2512.48 --> 2520.2400000000002
sometimes thank you very much

2516.8 --> 2520.88
i hope you're enjoying a nice summer

2520.24 --> 2526.0789999999997
weather

2520.88 --> 2526.079
as well oh hello by the way classic

2534.839 --> 2537.839
homeopath

2542.96 --> 2550.319
the province in the middle ontario yeah

2546.88 --> 2552.6400000000003
i'm just trying to find a good google

2550.319 --> 2552.64
map

2556.079 --> 2563.52
like an oversight map

2559.359 --> 2567.68
of yeah where in canada

2563.52 --> 2567.68
like how the languages are spread out

2570.56 --> 2575.68
okay this is a supposed spoken languages

2573.44 --> 2575.68
map

2575.76 --> 2579.8390000000004
oh it's so clumsy

2588.319 --> 2607.839
all right and the huge lake thing it's

2590.72 --> 2607.839
called hudson bay apparently

2610.4 --> 2621.839
okay this is not helping

2625.68 --> 2628.0789999999997
hmm

2632.839 --> 2640.48
okay according to this very simple map

2636.4 --> 2643.52
it's like france is pretty much

2640.48 --> 2643.52
the one province

2645.52 --> 2650.24
not this is all over the place quite

2660.839 --> 2663.839
back

2665.839 --> 2677.839
doesn't seem to be rolling out any

2668.0 --> 2677.839
uniform results

2693.92 --> 2698.4
yeah hudson bay is kind of ocean it

2696.16 --> 2705.839
looks like a big lake but it's like

2698.4 --> 2705.839
openly connected to the ocean yes

2713.92 --> 2719.839
hey shatner's bassoon

2722.319 --> 2726.96
great channel makes me think i make you

2723.92 --> 2726.96
think oh i love that

2730.64 --> 2737.68
i have moments

2733.76 --> 2740.5600000000004
but sometimes i'm just not super fluid

2737.68 --> 2741.9199999999996
especially at the start but usually with

2740.56 --> 2747.44
almost every show like

2741.92 --> 2751.04
after some time i do start getting

2747.44 --> 2751.04
a little bit more talkative

2756.96 --> 2760.0
maybe it's also the heat though i think

2759.44 --> 2761.839
that

2760.0 --> 2763.2
the last couple of years when it got

2761.839 --> 2767.599
really hot

2763.2 --> 2767.5989999999997
i tend to be a little bit more like just

2767.839 --> 2775.839
like soaking up the the nice weather

2771.599 --> 2775.839
kind of mood not so talkative

2778.24 --> 2788.0
although that does that does really

2780.079 --> 2790.079
change in the evening

2788.0 --> 2792.4
absolutely demolished professor phil

2790.079 --> 2796.2400000000002
bell yesterday on time

2792.4 --> 2796.2400000000002
concept in an experiment yeah

2800.56 --> 2803.7599999999998
all right did anybody pick up on like my

2803.119 --> 2807.28
weird

2803.76 --> 2809.6800000000003
ball win scenario

2807.28 --> 2813.44
at the flat earth debate whereas a

2809.68 --> 2813.44
baller i felt straw man

2815.04 --> 2818.24
like i tried to point like i felt like i

2817.52 --> 2821.44
was being

2818.24 --> 2821.4399999999996
it was so weird

2821.76 --> 2827.0400000000004
what was it uh i think daniel field in

2825.119 --> 2831.839
chat did pick up on that he

2827.04 --> 2831.839
actually made mention of it

2835.52 --> 2841.359
but i've seen that been replayed a

2837.52 --> 2841.359
couple of times now it's just like

2841.52 --> 2848.4
the what was it about again specifically

2844.96 --> 2852.559
equator line the definition of it

2848.4 --> 2854.559
how it was concentric to the earth

2852.559 --> 2855.92
even though that can mean a whole bunch

2854.559 --> 2858.48
of things

2855.92 --> 2860.0
it it basically only assumes the earth

2858.48 --> 2864.4
has a center

2860.0 --> 2867.52
but that can technically

2864.4 --> 2869.119
a lower level mean a whole lot a bunch

2867.52 --> 2871.52
of things

2869.119 --> 2872.88
right it's not concentric around the

2871.52 --> 2875.7599999999998
similar geometry

2872.88 --> 2877.6800000000003
that that thing tenthman literally

2875.76 --> 2879.2000000000003
inserted that like three times and

2877.68 --> 2884.0
everybody agreed with it

2879.2 --> 2884.0
and i was just trying to point out no no

2885.76 --> 2890.96
that's not what it said he inserted that

2888.24 --> 2890.9599999999996
in the middle of it

2897.76 --> 2905.3590000000004
i was wrong was i rest ahead sure

2902.319 --> 2907.2799999999997
except that i wasn't though because

2905.359 --> 2908.96
everything they said about how it

2907.28 --> 2911.44
already says

2908.96 --> 2912.16
the ball earth it was wrong the only

2911.44 --> 2914.559
ball earth

2912.16 --> 2916.0
in that whole definition was in the

2914.559 --> 2918.6400000000003
picture

2916.0 --> 2919.2
and the only hint at that it might be a

2918.64 --> 2921.2
ball

2919.2 --> 2923.2799999999997
based on that entire text was that it

2921.2 --> 2927.04
was concentric

2923.28 --> 2928.4
right i wasn't wrong but it's really

2927.04 --> 2932.079
nitpicky

2928.4 --> 2932.079
but i wasn't wrong

2932.88 --> 2935.6800000000003
that's ballwin

2937.03 --> 2940.079
[Music]

2955.28 --> 2958.4
it's an arbitrary line no no no it's

2957.52 --> 2961.52
it's not

2958.4 --> 2963.52
oh yeah it is arbitrary but

2961.52 --> 2965.7599999999998
it doesn't exist well it's not like a

2963.52 --> 2969.28
physical thing it's an extracted

2965.76 --> 2971.8390000000004
concept it's an averaging out

2969.28 --> 2971.8390000000004
right

2977.52 --> 2981.839
the definition said it no the definition

2980.72 --> 2985.5989999999997
didn't say it i

2981.839 --> 2988.64
it was literally on the screen there

2985.599 --> 2990.96
for like 15 minutes and it

2988.64 --> 2992.64
didn't say it the only thing it actually

2990.96 --> 2994.559
said that could hint at

2992.64 --> 2996.839
the earth being a ball besides the

2994.559 --> 2999.8390000000004
picture was the word

2996.839 --> 2999.839
concentric

3000.72 --> 3008.24
and i had to look it up myself to

3003.92 --> 3012.4
to make sure what concentric means

3008.24 --> 3015.2
and yeah i was right

3012.4 --> 3016.64
i really was but it is really nitpicky

3015.2 --> 3019.7599999999998
and i don't care

3016.64 --> 3022.8799999999997
if you disagree rastad i really don't

3019.76 --> 3026.3190000000004
because i know what i'm talking about

3022.88 --> 3027.2000000000003
i don't do random [ __ ] like that i'm not

3026.319 --> 3029.44
gonna

3027.2 --> 3031.52
put myself in the defensive position and

3029.44 --> 3034.559
hold on to it

3031.52 --> 3038.48
unless i'm certain that i'm right

3034.559 --> 3041.8390000000004
about something in it right not

3038.48 --> 3041.839
not that the earth is a ball

3042.48 --> 3048.16
it's that part is is basically a

3044.72 --> 3048.16
controlled opposition act

3053.28 --> 3057.52
yeah so no yeah i had to look up the

3056.079 --> 3069.8390000000004
word

3057.52 --> 3069.839
to make sure

3073.359 --> 3077.359
the center of it could be anywhere well

3075.44 --> 3077.76
that all depends on the nature of the

3077.359 --> 3079.44
realm

3077.76 --> 3080.96
right because if it's rectangular

3079.44 --> 3082.88
looping then there isn't going to be a

3080.96 --> 3086.079
center

3082.88 --> 3089.6800000000003
at all that become

3086.079 --> 3091.599
virtually impossible but technically the

3089.68 --> 3095.359
globe of the heavens

3091.599 --> 3098.559
even within the equator definition

3095.359 --> 3099.119
is concentric they do they don't say it

3098.559 --> 3101.599
like this

3099.119 --> 3104.2400000000002
but it is in reality concentric to the

3101.599 --> 3104.2400000000002
observer

3105.04 --> 3110.96
right that if it would say it like that

3108.839 --> 3114.16
then

3110.96 --> 3115.28
then it's actually correct but yeah it

3114.16 --> 3119.1189999999997
didn't say that but

3115.28 --> 3122.8
i don't care nothing out there

3119.119 --> 3125.119
right now is is like admitting

3122.8 --> 3126.319
that the heavens are purely holographic

3125.119 --> 3139.839
in that fashion so

3126.319 --> 3139.839
nothing out there will

3140.24 --> 3144.9599999999996
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

3142.24 --> 3144.9599999999996
rest ahead

3145.68 --> 3149.68
they were oh yeah i did know i did know

3148.24 --> 3153.1189999999997
oh you're trying to

3149.68 --> 3155.5989999999997
gaslight me now rest ahead dude

3153.119 --> 3155.599
[ __ ] off

3158.24 --> 3161.2799999999997
don't need that [ __ ] from you buddy

3160.319 --> 3163.359
you're wrong

3161.28 --> 3165.8390000000004
i know what i'm talking about i still

3163.359 --> 3168.16
know what i'm talking about

3165.839 --> 3170.0789999999997
right and i do see the forest through

3168.16 --> 3173.2
the trees

3170.079 --> 3174.7200000000003
you don't understand what i'm doing and

3173.2 --> 3177.1189999999997
you don't understand the thinking

3174.72 --> 3180.7999999999997
process behind it

3177.119 --> 3184.079
yeah don't tell me how to act baldwin

3180.8 --> 3187.8390000000004
okay i do know what i'm doing

3184.079 --> 3190.6400000000003
and i stand by my points that i made

3187.839 --> 3193.2
it wasn't in there it can mean the

3190.64 --> 3196.64
things that i said

3193.2 --> 3198.5589999999997
in that context it just all got really

3196.64 --> 3200.48
convoluted because i didn't really get a

3198.559 --> 3203.3590000000004
lot of room

3200.48 --> 3205.28
to even concisely make the points i was

3203.359 --> 3208.0789999999997
just constantly caught up in having to

3205.28 --> 3211.92
defend my position

3208.079 --> 3222.48
and getting scattergun so no rastad

3211.92 --> 3225.2000000000003
i wasn't wrong

3222.48 --> 3227.2
yeah and everybody knows it except not

3225.2 --> 3229.4399999999996
everybody

3227.2 --> 3230.5589999999997
rights already people in the chat here

3229.44 --> 3234.4
that

3230.559 --> 3237.8390000000004
that disagree with that so everybody

3234.4 --> 3237.839
no no

3238.8 --> 3245.52
it was crap well too bad

3242.72 --> 3246.319
because it's there to stay yeah you

3245.52 --> 3249.68
don't like it

3246.319 --> 3251.119
well get the [ __ ] out you don't like it

3249.68 --> 3253.9199999999996
you don't like that way

3251.119 --> 3255.119
or you go and do something then you go

3253.92 --> 3258.7200000000003
and be

3255.119 --> 3262.88
a flat earth debater cosmogenies then

3258.72 --> 3265.68
yeah i don't care you don't like it

3262.88 --> 3266.96
i'm gonna hold on to it you can't make

3265.68 --> 3269.2
me change it

3266.96 --> 3271.359
and i know i'm right and you can try to

3269.2 --> 3274.0789999999997
gaslight me

3271.359 --> 3276.0789999999997
in that nobody likes it that's just

3274.079 --> 3279.44
gonna make me lose respect for you

3276.079 --> 3293.8390000000004
very quickly again so

3279.44 --> 3293.839
no rest ahead deal with it

3318.43 --> 3321.5299999999997
[Music]

3332.839 --> 3335.839
do

3357.68 --> 3363.04
joe rogan the sellout is on blast for me

3360.88 --> 3365.359
i don't even know too much at what he's

3363.04 --> 3365.359
doing

3366.96 --> 3371.119
seems like he's having neil degrasse

3368.72 --> 3377.839
tyson on a lot

3371.119 --> 3377.839
compared to others

3380.4 --> 3386.1600000000003
so i i only really put the title in here

3383.839 --> 3387.68
as an ode to owen benjamin the

3386.16 --> 3391.839
recognition

3387.68 --> 3391.839
of having seen this video

3391.92 --> 3395.359
joe was threatened

3399.119 --> 3402.319
why are you saying that he was

3402.839 --> 3405.839
threatened

3409.92 --> 3413.2000000000003
like i don't think that joe is like

3412.72 --> 3416.839
really

3413.2 --> 3419.839
easily like physically threatened at

3416.839 --> 3419.839
least

3433.92 --> 3437.2000000000003
right thanks clutch bear

3442.96 --> 3447.839
i came up with it pretty much right

3444.799 --> 3447.839
before the show

3455.52 --> 3463.119
what he was i'm saying we don't know

3459.04 --> 3463.119
what yeah that's what you said before

3463.52 --> 3467.92
joe rogan's just like three year auntie

3465.599 --> 3467.92
stall

3469.2 --> 3489.839
oh god the guy has a family

3474.079 --> 3489.8390000000004
does he does joe rogan have a family

3496.96 --> 3500.7200000000003
i don't see it i don't think i think

3499.2 --> 3503.04
look

3500.72 --> 3504.16
this idea that you'd have to be

3503.04 --> 3506.64
threatened into

3504.16 --> 3508.48
coerced into doing something no why are

3506.64 --> 3510.16
you assuming that

3508.48 --> 3512.079
that's going to happen no most of the

3510.16 --> 3514.5589999999997
time i think it's just

3512.079 --> 3515.44
selling out it's just there somebody

3514.559 --> 3518.6400000000003
sees

3515.44 --> 3520.88
where they're going as sort of a threat

3518.64 --> 3522.8799999999997
to their enterprise whatever they're

3520.88 --> 3527.599
upholding their priesthood

3522.88 --> 3527.599
so they just offer him something

3528.0 --> 3533.92
and then he goes with it who who says he

3532.0 --> 3536.079
needs to be threatened who said

3533.92 --> 3537.119
that joe rogan was threatened i think he

3536.079 --> 3541.3590000000004
was just

3537.119 --> 3545.6800000000003
bought out probably offered like

3541.359 --> 3547.92
the whole dmt laboratory quality

3545.68 --> 3551.2799999999997
stuff and all that it probably was just

3547.92 --> 3551.28
offered a whole bunch of things

3553.52 --> 3561.119
like good connections

3558.64 --> 3561.1189999999997
all that

3564.0 --> 3568.24
all right the only thing that's really

3565.68 --> 3570.24
gonna be threatening is to take away

3568.24 --> 3573.839
stuff that he really that he really

3570.24 --> 3573.839
wants to have

3577.2 --> 3587.839
has a wife and daughters hmm

3588.799 --> 3591.119
okay

3592.799 --> 3598.839
i didn't even know that but yeah this

3595.92 --> 3601.839
i know i don't know a lot about joe

3598.839 --> 3601.839
rogan

3618.079 --> 3622.1600000000003
like his wife well maybe they threatened

3620.72 --> 3625.5989999999997
to kind of like

3622.16 --> 3625.5989999999997
harass them or something

3625.839 --> 3630.319
to make that to put them in a bad

3628.88 --> 3632.7200000000003
position in whatever

3630.319 --> 3634.0
yeah his daughters are doing in school

3632.72 --> 3635.52
or something

3634.0 --> 3637.839
you know like that it's like the

3635.52 --> 3640.64
demotion like you have to stop this now

3637.839 --> 3643.7599999999998
or we're gonna demote

3640.64 --> 3646.8799999999997
your family in the hierarchy

3643.76 --> 3648.559
that kind of thing maybe right doesn't

3646.88 --> 3651.2000000000003
necessarily have to come to

3648.559 --> 3652.88
like direct threats of violence and all

3651.2 --> 3657.839
that

3652.88 --> 3657.839
it's just downgrading

3663.2 --> 3666.5589999999997
take away his money well if they had the

3665.2 --> 3671.2799999999997
ability to do that

3666.559 --> 3673.6800000000003
then sure they could use that

3671.28 --> 3673.6800000000003
i don't know

3679.92 --> 3685.839
oh tim is a dumpster pups

3696.839 --> 3699.839
maybe

3704.0 --> 3706.319
hmm

3708.16 --> 3713.839
okay terminoid

3729.2 --> 3734.96
well look i don't even know what what

3732.319 --> 3738.0
joe rogan's position even is anymore

3734.96 --> 3738.0
with the moon landing

3739.119 --> 3744.0
like maybe he just wants to focus on

3743.599 --> 3747.039
like

3744.0 --> 3750.48
a well a kind of a side narrative

3747.039 --> 3752.559
sub mainstream right that was also in

3750.48 --> 3756.0
the movie interstellar

3752.559 --> 3758.6400000000003
how the moonletting landing was an act

3756.0 --> 3760.559
to politically trick the opponent into

3758.64 --> 3761.44
wasting all their resources blah blah

3760.559 --> 3764.3190000000004
blah

3761.44 --> 3764.7200000000003
and that it was actually faked even

3764.319 --> 3768.319
though

3764.72 --> 3769.839
it's possible right now right that

3768.319 --> 3771.68
that's still oh no no but the earth is

3769.839 --> 3774.72
not flat in the outer space is still

3771.68 --> 3778.3999999999996
real but they just had to act it like

3774.72 --> 3780.839
to me i even like already found

3778.4 --> 3782.4
that excuse like 20 years ago when i

3780.839 --> 3786.799
first

3782.4 --> 3788.559
got like my finger dipped into this sort

3786.799 --> 3789.28
of information and wasn't really able to

3788.559 --> 3792.079
handle it

3789.28 --> 3794.0
and had like that response like oh okay

3792.079 --> 3796.6400000000003
that means they just had to fake it

3794.0 --> 3800.0
doesn't mean it's not possible right

3796.64 --> 3805.7599999999998
maybe he's going for that narrative

3800.0 --> 3805.76
or is he like just kind of cocking to

3807.2 --> 3813.52
to space nationalism like he's now

3810.079 --> 3815.44
afraid to admit about the moon landing

3813.52 --> 3818.4
like astronaut level i don't know

3815.44 --> 3822.16
exactly where he is at

3818.4 --> 3825.44
probably the last thing

3822.16 --> 3827.52
i don't know anymore you know if you

3825.44 --> 3830.799
constantly have neil degrasse tyson on

3827.52 --> 3835.52
over the on the floor

3830.799 --> 3837.839
then yeah he's probably to that level

3835.52 --> 3839.599
but i don't really know because i don't

3837.839 --> 3842.96
really watch a show i

3839.599 --> 3845.28
barely sample clips of him

3842.96 --> 3847.119
it's usually like oh alex jones

3845.28 --> 3848.1600000000003
mentioned him in an article again or

3847.119 --> 3850.2400000000002
somewhere else

3848.16 --> 3851.44
some neil degrasse tyson thing happened

3850.24 --> 3853.359
on joe rogans again

3851.44 --> 3856.2400000000002
that's like the only way i ever get

3853.359 --> 3856.24
exposed to him because

3856.799 --> 3859.839
i don't really

3861.68 --> 3864.96
it just doesn't seem to me like he has

3863.599 --> 3869.2000000000003
any

3864.96 --> 3871.92
valuable input left to give

3869.2 --> 3872.24
that might be my impression it might be

3871.92 --> 3876.0
a

3872.24 --> 3881.839
valley in his intellectual career there

3876.0 --> 3881.839
he might come back i don't know

3882.88 --> 3887.2000000000003
it's just i'm not i haven't been very

3884.799 --> 3887.2
impressed

3888.079 --> 3890.7200000000003
for a while

3892.839 --> 3895.839
uh

3897.68 --> 3903.1189999999997
hey that flat fellow howdy yo i'm billy

3906.839 --> 3909.839
okay

3918.4 --> 3937.839
wow so real weird people

3921.52 --> 3937.839
active in the chat here

3960.16 --> 3963.44
no flat fellow no technically the moon

3962.559 --> 3966.3190000000004
look

3963.44 --> 3966.319
it it's

3969.92 --> 3973.92
it is not rotating around its own axis

3972.72 --> 3977.0389999999998
except

3973.92 --> 3977.52
for that the weird little turn that it

3977.039 --> 3979.3590000000004
does

3977.52 --> 3980.799
back and forth right next makes no

3979.359 --> 3984.319
freaking sense

3980.799 --> 3987.0389999999998
but it's not turning the face of it

3984.319 --> 3989.52
because it's always facing the earth

3987.039 --> 3992.1600000000003
which is really weird right

3989.52 --> 3994.319
so from a relativistic point of view it

3992.16 --> 3997.359
doesn't rotate around an axis

3994.319 --> 3997.359
in any sort of way

3999.68 --> 4005.5989999999997
now in the euclidean sense

4003.039 --> 4006.1600000000003
which gets really weird then you could

4005.599 --> 4008.2400000000002
consider

4006.16 --> 4010.8799999999997
it's rotating but that's look we're

4008.24 --> 4013.5989999999997
talking about

4010.88 --> 4016.88
heliocentric cosmology at this point so

4013.599 --> 4016.88
that's not even going to work

4017.119 --> 4022.2400000000002
that's still no it's oh god this

4020.16 --> 4022.24
is

4025.039 --> 4028.6400000000003
it's a yes and no that will never be

4027.44 --> 4031.599
compatible

4028.64 --> 4032.16
never result into either side being

4031.599 --> 4035.2000000000003
correct

4032.16 --> 4036.8799999999997
because it's all just presupposing it's

4035.2 --> 4041.1189999999997
a ball

4036.88 --> 4043.599
anyway tidal locked

4041.119 --> 4046.319
tidally locked oh really it's locked

4043.599 --> 4049.52
with the tides is it so the moon

4046.319 --> 4052.0
passes by twice a day

4049.52 --> 4053.0389999999998
it it goes around the earth twice in a

4052.0 --> 4056.16
day

4053.039 --> 4058.3190000000004
like the tides right and

4056.16 --> 4059.68
sometimes only once a day in other

4058.319 --> 4063.0389999999998
locations and

4059.68 --> 4067.2
another location three times right

4063.039 --> 4067.2000000000003
is that how it's tidally locked is it

4074.839 --> 4077.839
billy

4083.2 --> 4088.48
oh that's oh that isn't what tidal

4086.72 --> 4091.5989999999997
locking is

4088.48 --> 4095.039
oh so it it it's not locking

4091.599 --> 4097.1990000000005
with the tides

4095.039 --> 4099.359
those things that come twice a day in

4097.199 --> 4099.678999999999
certain regions and once a day in others

4099.359 --> 4103.279
and

4099.679 --> 4107.52
three times in other regions and like

4103.279 --> 4110.799000000001
that results in all the spirally visuals

4107.52 --> 4114.2390000000005
when you map them out over the earth

4110.799 --> 4118.0
not not those tides so it's not locked

4114.239 --> 4120.639999999999
in with the tides as the word

4118.0 --> 4120.64
says is it

4128.159 --> 4136.719
i thought that wasn't a claim

4132.88 --> 4139.92
wow tidal locking of the moon has

4136.719 --> 4142.4800000000005
nothing to do with the tides on earth

4139.92 --> 4145.1990000000005
well isn't that just sneaky just put the

4142.48 --> 4147.839
suggestion there of the word tides

4145.199 --> 4149.5199999999995
so you start to associate the tides with

4147.839 --> 4151.04
the moon

4149.52 --> 4152.88
even though that's not even what it

4151.04 --> 4157.679
means

4152.88 --> 4160.400000000001
oh it's just a name

4157.679 --> 4161.839
they just used the word tights in there

4160.4 --> 4164.4
because like oh those

4161.839 --> 4166.4
just random tights why not right has

4164.4 --> 4169.759
nothing to do with the tights though

4166.4 --> 4175.04
just like call it tidal locking

4169.759 --> 4177.04
brilliant right

4175.04 --> 4178.96
tidal locking has nothing to do with

4177.04 --> 4181.92
tides

4178.96 --> 4185.12
even though it is claimed through

4181.92 --> 4188.719
heliocentric cosmologists

4185.12 --> 4192.239
that the moon causes the tights

4188.719 --> 4195.359
through gravity but tidal locking has

4192.239 --> 4195.3589999999995
nothing to do with tights

4195.52 --> 4199.280000000001
that's not confusing at all

4201.28 --> 4209.04
oh it's more

4204.719 --> 4209.04
general than just from

4211.28 --> 4219.92
really tights this is general

4215.76 --> 4223.360000000001
i when you look up the word tides

4219.92 --> 4224.64
where does general come out up as a

4223.36 --> 4231.839999999999
synonym

4224.64 --> 4231.84
i don't think they're compatible

4234.56 --> 4242.080000000001
like how is tidal

4237.92 --> 4245.84
or tides used as a technical

4242.08 --> 4245.84
general terminology

4246.719 --> 4259.84
i don't see it

4267.16 --> 4270.25
[Music]

4270.84 --> 4278.729
hmm

4272.11 --> 4278.728999999999
[Music]

4282.93 --> 4286.52
[Music]

4289.28 --> 4301.84
no it is not a claim really billy

4304.29 --> 4307.39
[Music]

4312.84 --> 4315.84
okay

4321.679 --> 4326.64
oh really billy

4327.44 --> 4334.96
tidal forces which exists on anybody

4330.719 --> 4334.96
orbiting each other not just

4336.08 --> 4343.44
it wow

4339.52 --> 4347.84
okay now so now tidal locking

4343.44 --> 4350.799999999999
does actually refer to tidal forces

4347.84 --> 4351.84
because of orbiting subjected to every

4350.8 --> 4354.56
planet right

4351.84 --> 4356.64
how is that so it does have to do with

4354.56 --> 4361.280000000001
the tides now

4356.64 --> 4363.360000000001
hmm this is very fascinating you seem to

4361.28 --> 4366.48
be kind of in a

4363.36 --> 4369.759999999999
quantum flux position on whether

4366.48 --> 4370.48
the moon actually causes tides or not

4369.76 --> 4374.719
this is

4370.48 --> 4374.718999999999
really fascinating to behold

4379.52 --> 4384.159000000001
wow okay so now it does have to do with

4382.719 --> 4399.84
the tidal forces oh

4384.159 --> 4399.839999999999
oh it's not contradicting at all

4416.88 --> 4424.719
right so billy howdy yo i'm billy

4421.76 --> 4426.64
what about before where you literally

4424.719 --> 4429.04
set 2 233

4426.64 --> 4432.56
tidal locking of the moon has nothing to

4429.04 --> 4432.56
do with tides on earth

4433.84 --> 4444.8
and now you're saying

4440.92 --> 4446.88
237 yes it has to do with tidal forces

4444.8 --> 4450.719
not just tides on earth

4446.88 --> 4450.719
so how are these two statements

4452.84 --> 4457.04
compatible

4454.64 --> 4457.84
because yeah you're trying to be

4457.04 --> 4460.64
rational but

4457.84 --> 4462.400000000001
yeah it is contradicting literally these

4460.64 --> 4466.320000000001
two things right there in chat

4462.4 --> 4469.599999999999
that you've said with four minutes apart

4466.32 --> 4472.5599999999995
classic global by the way right bring in

4469.6 --> 4474.56
the total 180 degrees contradictions

4472.56 --> 4477.679
within the time span of five minutes and

4474.56 --> 4483.84
then say that you didn't do that

4477.679 --> 4487.76
right classic global

4483.84 --> 4490.2390000000005
right yeah seeking star wars but

4487.76 --> 4492.0
you oh you do realize that it's very

4490.239 --> 4493.919999999999
easy to point out

4492.0 --> 4496.159
if you don't get gas lit and then they

4493.92 --> 4499.04
just end up gaslighting themselves

4496.159 --> 4500.799999999999
trying to pull through the situation

4499.04 --> 4503.28
after that

4500.8 --> 4505.360000000001
imagining that they were right after all

4503.28 --> 4508.159
even though everybody can see that they

4505.36 --> 4511.839999999999
were just blatantly wrong

4508.159 --> 4511.839999999999
right gaslighting yourself

4528.56 --> 4533.679
okay now now you're just contradicting

4532.239 --> 4536.159
yourself

4533.679 --> 4536.96
in a singular sentence this is really

4536.159 --> 4540.5599999999995
special

4536.96 --> 4542.56
special audio and billy

4540.56 --> 4545.120000000001
because tidal locking of the moon has

4542.56 --> 4547.52
nothing to do with the tides on earth

4545.12 --> 4549.92
tidal forces caused tidal locking off

4547.52 --> 4550.4800000000005
the moon tidal forces caused tides on

4549.92 --> 4553.12
the earth

4550.48 --> 4556.879999999999
by tidal locking of the moon doesn't

4553.12 --> 4556.88
have to do with the tides on earth

4558.96 --> 4567.84
so why is it called tidal locking then

4568.32 --> 4571.599999999999
yeah yeah i try to be irrational yeah

4571.28 --> 4575.12
but

4571.6 --> 4578.84
why is it called tidal locking then

4575.12 --> 4581.199
why is the word tides put into the

4578.84 --> 4583.679
locking

4581.199 --> 4584.879999999999
right why wouldn't you call it like

4583.679 --> 4588.32
orbital locking

4584.88 --> 4588.32
seems much more sensible

4592.84 --> 4595.84
right

4596.56 --> 4600.56
but no it's called tidal locking you

4598.4 --> 4602.32
already said like yeah it does have to

4600.56 --> 4605.6
do with the tights but then

4602.32 --> 4607.599999999999
you put it all down again

4605.6 --> 4609.6
tell me how it's all involved with the

4607.6 --> 4612.159000000001
different types of tides

4609.6 --> 4614.400000000001
but that tidal locking doesn't have to

4612.159 --> 4617.839999999999
do with tights

4614.4 --> 4617.839999999999
yeah brilliant

4619.84 --> 4628.2390000000005
oh so it's arrived from the tidal forces

4624.32 --> 4631.12
so it does have to do with the tides

4628.239 --> 4632.32
tidal forces you know the thing that's

4631.12 --> 4636.32
described

4632.32 --> 4638.08
as two planets or whatever a moon and a

4636.32 --> 4641.28
planet being close

4638.08 --> 4644.4
and then the mass attracting mass causes

4641.28 --> 4646.5599999999995
the fluid liquids to bulge a little

4644.4 --> 4649.679
right the tidal forces

4646.56 --> 4652.400000000001
that cause tides tides

4649.679 --> 4655.28
caused by supposed tidal forces is said

4652.4 --> 4656.96
in heliocentrism

4655.28 --> 4659.36
but tidal locking of the moon has

4656.96 --> 4665.84
nothing to do with the tides

4659.36 --> 4665.839999999999
okay okay billy sure

4670.65 --> 4673.83
[Music]

4678.64 --> 4683.4400000000005
yeah but but the thing is when you use

4682.159 --> 4687.599999999999
the word date

4683.44 --> 4689.678999999999
as a time or as a social interaction

4687.6 --> 4692.96
yeah that's two different meanings of

4689.679 --> 4696.159
the word well guess what tidal

4692.96 --> 4698.2390000000005
locking tides

4696.159 --> 4699.599999999999
they're based in the same effect

4698.239 --> 4703.12
literally

4699.6 --> 4703.120000000001
described by you

4703.199 --> 4708.639999999999
they're not oh no this is a totally

4706.32 --> 4710.08
different type of tide no no it's the

4708.64 --> 4712.719
cause of tights

4710.08 --> 4714.96
it's totally different it's not directly

4712.719 --> 4715.84
related to the thing that they're called

4714.96 --> 4719.6
tides

4715.84 --> 4720.2390000000005
right it's it's another meaning it

4719.6 --> 4722.8
doesn't have

4720.239 --> 4724.159
anything to do with it no no that's not

4722.8 --> 4727.28
this

4724.159 --> 4729.92
that's not oh date and date no no

4727.28 --> 4731.84
this is exactly the same root of the

4729.92 --> 4735.36
word

4731.84 --> 4738.8
this tide is a laundry well maybe he

4735.36 --> 4742.48
swallowed a couple of tide pots

4738.8 --> 4744.96
or something because you're literally

4742.48 --> 4745.44
contradicting yourself and now you're

4744.96 --> 4747.92
stuck

4745.44 --> 4751.199
into that and you're unable to admit it

4747.92 --> 4751.1990000000005
it's quite bizarre

4758.56 --> 4763.76
yeah keep keep chanting for him keep

4761.04 --> 4768.08
chanting buddies

4763.76 --> 4771.360000000001
leaky warrior moriotis maximus

4768.08 --> 4771.36
fitting name for you

4775.76 --> 4782.320000000001
there is no contradiction there is no

4779.04 --> 4784.56
double speak it doesn't exist

4782.32 --> 4786.5599999999995
tidal locking has nothing to do with

4784.56 --> 4791.04
ties even though

4786.56 --> 4795.1990000000005
it's based on the effect

4791.04 --> 4796.8
of tides because of bodies close to each

4795.199 --> 4800.159
other causing that

4796.8 --> 4819.84
but it has nothing to do with tides

4800.159 --> 4819.839999999999
okay okay everything will be all right

4858.84 --> 4861.84
so

4895.12 --> 4899.12
yeah i'm just gonna let that all sink in

4900.84 --> 4905.1990000000005
because

4902.56 --> 4906.0
this guy whoever made that sock he's a

4905.199 --> 4910.08
trencher

4906.0 --> 4910.08
could be ed or whoever

4913.199 --> 4916.32
because he's he's doubling down on his

4915.36 --> 4918.96
stupid

4916.32 --> 4922.08
he's just saying no tight locking has

4918.96 --> 4925.4800000000005
nothing to do with tights

4922.08 --> 4929.6
even though when you describe it it

4925.48 --> 4930.959999999999
absolutely has to do with tights

4929.6 --> 4933.120000000001
but that's okay that's not a

4930.96 --> 4936.88
contradiction then because you're

4933.12 --> 4940.719
[ __ ] out of your mind buddy

4936.88 --> 4940.719
that's clinically psychotic

4941.44 --> 4947.759999999999
clinically really bad

4944.8 --> 4948.400000000001
if you're literally going with that you

4947.76 --> 4950.8
know

4948.4 --> 4952.879999999999
as a funny act or something and hey you

4950.8 --> 4955.04
have the stupid sock name so you're

4952.88 --> 4957.6
you're almost virtual signaling that you

4955.04 --> 4960.639
are acting stupid on purpose

4957.6 --> 4965.4400000000005
but if that's real to you you

4960.639 --> 4965.4400000000005
need some serious mental help buddy

4970.84 --> 4974.88
seriously guys

4973.12 --> 4977.12
other people in chat can i get some

4974.88 --> 4980.2390000000005
confirmation for that

4977.12 --> 4983.599999999999
because he's just doubling down

4980.239 --> 4984.638999999999
continually but am i wrong about what i

4983.6 --> 4987.76
said

4984.639 --> 4988.4800000000005
or is he indeed literally contradicting

4987.76 --> 4992.0
himself

4988.48 --> 4994.5599999999995
constantly in like an inward spiral loop

4992.0 --> 4996.88
like at this point i should ban you for

4994.56 --> 4999.04
your own protection

4996.88 --> 5000.08
because when you're like this you're

4999.04 --> 5002.48
just gonna

5000.08 --> 5003.84
damage yourself spiritually when you go

5002.48 --> 5007.5199999999995
that doubling down

5003.84 --> 5009.76
on stupid and self-contradiction

5007.52 --> 5009.76
but

5011.28 --> 5015.84
he's like yeah

5017.84 --> 5022.400000000001
but on the other hand it is kind of a

5019.76 --> 5025.679
marvelous example

5022.4 --> 5028.32
you know it is pretty

5025.679 --> 5030.8
telling because i i even mentioned it on

5028.32 --> 5033.199
the flat earth debates from friday

5030.8 --> 5036.08
like yeah that you don't i interrupted

5033.199 --> 5038.4
elijah for it

5036.08 --> 5041.76
like no you don't have to go and look

5038.4 --> 5044.5599999999995
back at the older episodes

5041.76 --> 5045.76
figure out how the ballers contradict

5044.56 --> 5049.84
themselves because

5045.76 --> 5052.56
they literally do it within five minutes

5049.84 --> 5054.32
of the same show and that's just what he

5052.56 --> 5056.2390000000005
did

5054.32 --> 5057.679
and he's still holding on to it he's

5056.239 --> 5060.959999999999
like no it's

5057.679 --> 5064.4
okay to be completely self-contradicting

5060.96 --> 5066.639
i like psychosis i like when things

5064.4 --> 5067.839999999999
don't make any sense in plain sight and

5066.639 --> 5071.04
i double down on i

5067.84 --> 5072.159000000001
like that i like the psychosis huh don't

5071.04 --> 5074.96
you

5072.159 --> 5077.599999999999
well when you're like that it's a really

5074.96 --> 5080.719
sick form of mania

5077.6 --> 5080.96
and you need help it's very unhealthy

5080.719 --> 5084.32
it's

5080.96 --> 5086.8
dangerous for you

5084.32 --> 5090.0
and for people you associate with

5086.8 --> 5093.04
because when you go that far

5090.0 --> 5094.96
[ __ ] happens not through this

5093.04 --> 5095.6
communication not through you on this

5094.96 --> 5097.679
show but

5095.6 --> 5098.88
through when you don't pay attention out

5097.679 --> 5102.88
there it's

5098.88 --> 5106.400000000001
really really unhealthy

5102.88 --> 5107.52
to be this self-contradicting and

5106.4 --> 5109.599999999999
doubling down on it

5107.52 --> 5111.360000000001
it's really bad for you this is a

5109.6 --> 5113.84
genuine warning to you

5111.36 --> 5113.839999999999
billy

5116.32 --> 5119.84
no it's not an aesthetic objection it's

5118.719 --> 5123.84
literally

5119.84 --> 5126.400000000001
the same word by your own description

5123.84 --> 5128.0
route it in the same effect when you

5126.4 --> 5131.44
describe where it came from

5128.0 --> 5131.76
you described a tide as presupposed how

5131.44 --> 5134.4
it's

5131.76 --> 5135.92
working on the heliocentric model you

5134.4 --> 5139.679
literally said it you

5135.92 --> 5142.719
lunatic you literally said it

5139.679 --> 5145.12
in chat right and

5142.719 --> 5146.56
yeah you could cover it up i don't even

5145.12 --> 5149.36
think you will at this point i think

5146.56 --> 5152.88
that you don't care anymore

5149.36 --> 5155.12
but it's all it's all there the text is

5152.88 --> 5157.76
all there record it right whatever you

5155.12 --> 5160.8
do to it afterward or whether i get

5157.76 --> 5163.679
get to ban you because you go overboard

5160.8 --> 5165.52
negative you're just crazy now but if

5163.679 --> 5168.2390000000005
you go negative i might ban you

5165.52 --> 5169.76
but it's all right there on the screen

5168.239 --> 5173.5199999999995
it's never gonna go away it's

5169.76 --> 5174.88
part of the show cannot be edited

5173.52 --> 5178.639
afterward

5174.88 --> 5181.679
right so yeah you think

5178.639 --> 5182.0
you can just do this it's all on record

5181.679 --> 5185.679
this

5182.0 --> 5188.639
is like literally like a psychoanalysis

5185.679 --> 5190.8
it's on record exactly what you do what

5188.639 --> 5193.4400000000005
you do right here

5190.8 --> 5195.4400000000005
you're contradicting yourself really

5193.44 --> 5210.239
badly and you're doubling down

5195.44 --> 5215.04
and you don't seem to be willing to stop

5210.239 --> 5215.04
so hey leaky warrior mr capps

5215.36 --> 5219.12
where comes where does the word title

5217.679 --> 5221.52
come from

5219.12 --> 5222.84
how wh where does that come from what's

5221.52 --> 5225.84
the root of the word

5222.84 --> 5225.84
title

5233.52 --> 5238.0
bro what's the root word of the word

5237.04 --> 5240.32
title

5238.0 --> 5240.32
bro

5245.84 --> 5249.84
now i am rational you can stop

5248.239 --> 5252.48
gaslighting yourself now

5249.84 --> 5253.4400000000005
nobody's buying it you're literally an

5252.48 --> 5256.718999999999
embarrassing

5253.44 --> 5261.839999999999
[ __ ] double speaker

5256.719 --> 5261.84
[ __ ] in chat right now

5262.0 --> 5266.0
making a complete ass of himself and

5264.56 --> 5269.679
thinks that he

5266.0 --> 5270.88
is the one exposing poor old are we

5269.679 --> 5273.92
making a mistake

5270.88 --> 5274.4800000000005
oh yeah oh oh i'm gonna buy that even

5273.92 --> 5276.8
though it's

5274.48 --> 5278.0
literally written down and spelled out

5276.8 --> 5282.400000000001
by yourself

5278.0 --> 5284.96
how you are wrong you literally

5282.4 --> 5286.5599999999995
explained how you are wrong and now you

5284.96 --> 5289.6
can't handle it because you're a

5286.56 --> 5292.96
[ __ ] witless [ __ ]

5289.6 --> 5296.8
you're a [ __ ] an idiot

5292.96 --> 5299.199
right doesn't matter how well you could

5296.8 --> 5300.8
in a certain moment put down the words

5299.199 --> 5303.839999999999
you're a complete

5300.8 --> 5307.04
[ __ ] you

5303.84 --> 5311.52
literally defused your own argument

5307.04 --> 5314.0
and now you refuse the reality of it

5311.52 --> 5316.2390000000005
to let that sink in and you think it's a

5314.0 --> 5318.48
better strategy to just try to gaslight

5316.239 --> 5321.5199999999995
good old irwin right

5318.48 --> 5325.5199999999995
because that works sure sure that

5321.52 --> 5325.52
that works no no it doesn't

5326.159 --> 5332.719
yeah i believe that i know that

5329.199 --> 5337.12
[ __ ] witless [ __ ]

5332.719 --> 5340.159
[ __ ] billy [ __ ]

5337.12 --> 5340.159
yeah you did

5340.56 --> 5345.76
yeah why don't you be rational read back

5343.84 --> 5350.159000000001
what you said

5345.76 --> 5351.92
and then take a [ __ ] hint [ __ ]

5350.159 --> 5353.04
stop trying to gaslight me it's not

5351.92 --> 5354.96
working you're not going to be

5353.04 --> 5358.239
gaslighting my audience

5354.96 --> 5361.199
or anybody that's watching this you're

5358.239 --> 5364.32
only gaslighting yourself

5361.199 --> 5366.0
and that comes with a price

5364.32 --> 5368.96
right and you're going to find out what

5366.0 --> 5372.08
that price is eventually

5368.96 --> 5375.44
yeah let me give a hint part of it is

5372.08 --> 5378.159
dementia yeah can you feel it

5375.44 --> 5379.839999999999
can you feel it all slip away and that's

5378.159 --> 5381.599999999999
what happens when you contradict

5379.84 --> 5382.56
yourself blatantly and then you keep

5381.6 --> 5386.400000000001
holding on to it

5382.56 --> 5389.679
it literally causes spontaneous

5386.4 --> 5392.96
dementia it's happening to you right now

5389.679 --> 5393.679
idiot it's all because you're you're too

5392.96 --> 5396.159
proud

5393.679 --> 5397.92
and arrogant you're a piece of [ __ ] and

5396.159 --> 5407.839999999999
you're holding on to something

5397.92 --> 5407.84
really [ __ ] stupid

5431.76 --> 5438.96
tidal volume cool so it's kind of like

5435.84 --> 5442.2390000000005
the tide up and down

5438.96 --> 5445.84
full empty full

5442.239 --> 5448.959999999999
empty right that the tidal volume

5445.84 --> 5452.32
moved in and out of lungs

5448.96 --> 5456.32
yes yeah how about title locking

5452.32 --> 5456.32
right what is it locked on

5457.6 --> 5465.04
how is it locked in relation to what

5461.199 --> 5470.799999999999
the the tidal forces

5465.04 --> 5473.84
of bodies in orbit of one another

5470.8 --> 5475.6
which are supposed to cause the tides

5473.84 --> 5476.96
on earth right with the moon right so

5475.6 --> 5481.92
they are actually

5476.96 --> 5481.92
the same thing you [ __ ] imbecile

5483.6 --> 5493.52
oh i can't learn from a physics

5490.08 --> 5496.5599999999995
yes i can yes i can [ __ ]

5493.52 --> 5497.6
i can i can learn about physics from

5496.56 --> 5499.92
etymology

5497.6 --> 5502.84
it's called tracing back the meaning of

5499.92 --> 5505.4400000000005
the [ __ ] words

5502.84 --> 5509.12
[ __ ] yeah

5505.44 --> 5511.44
yeah i can thanks thanks for the double

5509.12 --> 5513.76
think hint it's not working

5511.44 --> 5515.36
you're actually giving me good advice in

5513.76 --> 5518.400000000001
your

5515.36 --> 5520.719
double think advice

5518.4 --> 5522.239
discouragement yeah because i know what

5520.719 --> 5522.96
you're doing and you're holding on to

5522.239 --> 5526.4
something that's

5522.96 --> 5528.88
really petty and

5526.4 --> 5530.799999999999
i recommend you don't ever do this to

5528.88 --> 5532.96
anybody's face

5530.8 --> 5534.719
because they're going to show you what

5532.96 --> 5536.88
you actually deserve

5534.719 --> 5538.719
for doing something like that if you do

5536.88 --> 5542.32
it to their face

5538.719 --> 5545.6
right you don't thinking freak

5542.32 --> 5549.679
you freak double thinking freak

5545.6 --> 5552.2390000000005
liar self liar so deluded you can't even

5549.679 --> 5555.4400000000005
realize that you're lying to yourself in

5552.239 --> 5555.44
the [ __ ] moment like a

5558.84 --> 5561.84
freak

5572.84 --> 5575.84
so

5586.84 --> 5592.639
so

5589.28 --> 5593.679
all right yeah let's ban sean hawkins

5592.639 --> 5596.2390000000005
over there

5593.679 --> 5597.52
[ __ ] doesn't have anything real to

5596.239 --> 5600.08
say

5597.52 --> 5601.040000000001
just yeah yeah i'm gonna help you double

5600.08 --> 5604.0
down on your

5601.04 --> 5605.5199999999995
[ __ ] double think stupidity and

5604.0 --> 5607.92
support that

5605.52 --> 5610.56
like a sean hawkins only sean hawkins

5607.92 --> 5612.4800000000005
would chill to the dumbest of [ __ ]

5610.56 --> 5615.120000000001
dumb so i think that stanley stud

5612.48 --> 5616.5599999999995
there it's probably sean hawkins suck

5615.12 --> 5619.599999999999
because only somebody

5616.56 --> 5631.84
that stupid could chill for somebody

5619.6 --> 5631.84
that blatantly wrong

5633.12 --> 5637.44
it's all in your head man yeah yeah you

5635.92 --> 5640.88
know where it's also at

5637.44 --> 5644.48
audio i'm billy yeah

5640.88 --> 5648.08
it's on video it's right there

5644.48 --> 5648.48
it's right there and anybody can watch

5648.08 --> 5651.76
this

5648.48 --> 5653.919999999999
over and over and over again read

5651.76 --> 5654.88
exactly what you said and when you said

5653.92 --> 5657.92
it

5654.88 --> 5659.679
yeah and then see how i analyzed it how

5657.92 --> 5660.4800000000005
i pointed things out and how you

5659.679 --> 5663.28
responded

5660.48 --> 5665.04
yeah it's all perfectly on record you

5663.28 --> 5668.5599999999995
are exposed

5665.04 --> 5670.96
right you're only gaslighting yourself

5668.56 --> 5672.2390000000005
the only one you are attempting to

5670.96 --> 5676.8
convince at this point

5672.239 --> 5678.959999999999
is yourself and your white knight soccer

5676.8 --> 5681.04
buddies out there that are just doubling

5678.96 --> 5683.04
down on your retardation right who's the

5681.04 --> 5683.6
dumber the fool or the fool that follows

5683.04 --> 5686.239
him

5683.6 --> 5689.52
now the [ __ ] fools that follow him

5686.239 --> 5691.349999999999
right but you're pretty damn stupid

5689.52 --> 5692.719
you are

5691.35 --> 5694.8
[Music]

5692.719 --> 5696.159
stopping for being rational is

5694.8 --> 5697.92
irrational

5696.159 --> 5699.44
yeah well you know what's also

5697.92 --> 5702.0
irrational

5699.44 --> 5704.239
double speaking contradicting yourself

5702.0 --> 5706.159
and then doubling down on it for half an

5704.239 --> 5710.0
hour

5706.159 --> 5713.199
yeah so why'd you stop projecting

5710.0 --> 5715.199
why'd you get a little rational because

5713.199 --> 5717.5199999999995
you're getting a little off the rails

5715.199 --> 5718.638999999999
right this is just pure projection at

5717.52 --> 5720.320000000001
this point

5718.639 --> 5722.0
right are you telling me what i'm

5720.32 --> 5723.84
supposed to be telling you because you

5722.0 --> 5725.92
can't tell yourself

5723.84 --> 5728.0
because you're so far down into the

5725.92 --> 5731.04
[ __ ] of self-contradiction you

5728.0 --> 5733.199
can't correct yourself anymore somebody

5731.04 --> 5735.76
else has to do it now so just project

5733.199 --> 5737.599999999999
what i need to tell you yeah project to

5735.76 --> 5740.08
me what i need to tell you

5737.6 --> 5740.96
the necessary things you need to hear

5740.08 --> 5743.119
because you

5740.96 --> 5744.56
can't get through to yourself anymore

5743.119 --> 5747.199
you're that lost

5744.56 --> 5747.1990000000005
billy boy

5750.239 --> 5757.44
technical terms yeah technical like

5753.52 --> 5761.4400000000005
in what causes the thai technicals title

5757.44 --> 5766.08
locking title title based on tides

5761.44 --> 5769.44
tidal forces the cause of tides

5766.08 --> 5773.44
oh so it's in the same root of the word

5769.44 --> 5775.599999999999
right not totally two different meanings

5773.44 --> 5777.678999999999
yeah like you claimed before you double

5775.6 --> 5782.400000000001
speaking funny piece of [ __ ]

5777.679 --> 5785.119
yeah i know it's all on record [ __ ]

5782.4 --> 5787.92
right i'm running out this [ __ ] show it

5785.119 --> 5790.4
was hilarious though

5787.92 --> 5791.679
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

5790.4 --> 5794.08
liked this show

5791.679 --> 5795.92
last part was certainly uh interesting

5794.08 --> 5796.639
going up against the double thinking

5795.92 --> 5799.84
[ __ ]

5796.639 --> 5801.76
in chat it will never stop probably spam

5799.84 --> 5802.639
my comments as well because that's what

5801.76 --> 5804.56
happened

5802.639 --> 5806.0
when you contradict yourself and then

5804.56 --> 5808.320000000001
you try to guess like

5806.0 --> 5810.56
everybody out of that position and then

5808.32 --> 5814.08
they don't let you

5810.56 --> 5816.0
now what i do i i actually put you in a

5814.08 --> 5820.88
cage and then all that gas

5816.0 --> 5824.32
yeah i use it to fry you

5820.88 --> 5825.679
right you're in an oven that gas you're

5824.32 --> 5829.04
trying to gas like yeah

5825.679 --> 5832.4
that's now used to literally bake you

5829.04 --> 5836.8
