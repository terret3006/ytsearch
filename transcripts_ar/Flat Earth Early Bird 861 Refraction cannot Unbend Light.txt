is quite beautiful

88.92 --> 93.18
look at that

90.72 --> 96.17999999999999
sun is out

93.18 --> 98.96000000000001
there's still some clouds pretty fluffy

96.18 --> 98.96000000000001
looking clouds

100.32 --> 104.69999999999999
it's nice and warm oh there the Sun goes

102.899 --> 106.02
behind the cloud now it's a little bit

104.7 --> 108.299
more cold

106.02 --> 110.399
but yeah it's still quite unpredictable

108.299 --> 112.259
weather as when I got up pretty early

110.399 --> 115.07900000000001
today

112.259 --> 116.88
like it started to snow like really

115.079 --> 120.24
heavy snow

116.88 --> 122.33999999999999
like what it was sunny then it just

120.24 --> 124.79899999999999
started to snow very heavily

122.34 --> 127.38000000000001
that was weird but yeah that's that

124.799 --> 131.34
cloud has since passed

127.38 --> 134.879
so no it's kind of nice and sunny again

131.34 --> 137.4
uh yeah inside out of outside of the

134.879 --> 139.26
wind it's really nice and warm outside

137.4 --> 140.64000000000001
though there's a lot of moist in the air

139.26 --> 142.2
and it's cold

140.64 --> 144.95899999999997
[Music]

142.2 --> 147.29999999999998
so yeah it was fully packed

144.959 --> 149.78
closed when I went out for groceries

147.3 --> 149.78
this morning

149.94 --> 155.4
but inside yeah I can just sit in my

152.4 --> 157.94
t-shirt and it's really nice

155.4 --> 157.94
so

158.239 --> 167.81900000000002
it's Monday the 12th 12th 12th

164.64 --> 170.879
12th God

167.819 --> 172.85999999999999
the 12 12

170.879 --> 174.0
I don't know why I can't get this out of

172.86 --> 178.56
my mind

174.0 --> 180.48
the 12 it's 12 April April 12th

178.56 --> 182.659
why can't I get this word out of my

180.48 --> 182.659
mouth

183.06 --> 188.879
12 I'm just gonna call it 12. right

186.36 --> 191.28
April the 12th

188.879 --> 193.2
2021

191.28 --> 194.519
that was weird

193.2 --> 197.94
uh

194.519 --> 200.04
right hello tarot 306 first in chat

197.94 --> 202.85999999999999
welcome back

200.04 --> 206.159
Tom Parker good morning

202.86 --> 207.48000000000002
right so those that have been here from

206.159 --> 209.64
the beginning might know I might have

207.48 --> 212.819
noticed like I did a little Tech

209.64 --> 215.27999999999997
Improvement on the intro because now

212.819 --> 217.319
when the intro ends it's not a black

215.28 --> 219.9
screen you get to see the same

217.319 --> 223.57999999999998
background animation as

219.9 --> 223.58
right over there

223.739 --> 227.519
so yeah that's pretty it's very pretty

225.659 --> 231.2
to look at

227.519 --> 231.20000000000002
so there's now like a transition

231.659 --> 235.26
to adjust the background and then

233.4 --> 236.64000000000001
switching to the front of the show so it

235.26 --> 239.459
looks much better that way you should

236.64 --> 244.76
have done that before but I

239.459 --> 244.76
yeah I didn't realize that was going on

245.099 --> 249.83999999999997
all right so yeah

248.099 --> 253.459
I got up

249.84 --> 253.459
really early for my doing

254.159 --> 260.82
and I went to bed pretty early too

256.919 --> 264.74
to really get myself into some

260.82 --> 264.74
kind of morning action mood

265.44 --> 270.96
and

267.9 --> 274.28
right I did yeah I didn't get I I was

270.96 --> 276.65999999999997
actually planning to to get to like the

274.28 --> 277.73999999999995
unemployment office I guess you could

276.66 --> 280.8
call it

277.74 --> 282.419
but yeah right pretty much when the

280.8 --> 283.5
moment when I was gonna go there it

282.419 --> 287.46
snowed

283.5 --> 290.06
so I passed on that

287.46 --> 290.06
yeah

290.28 --> 293.35999999999996
also just

296.1 --> 302.03900000000004
man I've been having a very dream happy

298.8 --> 304.88
night very very dream happy a lot of

302.039 --> 304.88
different dreams

309.12 --> 314.84000000000003
but yeah overall I've been very I'm very

311.94 --> 314.84
rested this morning

322.38 --> 325.1
hmm

326.22 --> 330.199

333.479 --> 339.919

346.68 --> 349.46
what

357.479 --> 364.74
haha

360.259 --> 367.38
yeah that's very artistic

364.74 --> 370.58
I doubt it's real though

367.38 --> 370.58
very much doubted

377.759 --> 382.5
but that is pretty remarkable looking at

380.759 --> 386.84000000000003
least

382.5 --> 386.84
maybe I can share that hold on

396.28 --> 399.53

545.54 --> 551.8199999999999
not really I'll have them over for a

548.76 --> 555.48
discussion it's just that I've I don't

551.82 --> 557.7600000000001
have too much patience for typical

555.48 --> 560.399
baller rebuttals especially if they

557.76 --> 562.68
start trying to Gaslight me

560.399 --> 567.06
like on my own show

562.68 --> 569.399
but I do tolerate globe earthers in chat

567.06 --> 572.5999999999999
up to a certain extent

569.399 --> 572.6
Louis Hudson

573.72 --> 579.6800000000001
talking about that flight from Sydney to

577.32 --> 579.6800000000001
Chile

580.08 --> 585.32
he was talking about it

582.6 --> 585.32
okay

591.72 --> 595.74
hmm

593.76 --> 597.899
well I guess all of you guys have

595.74 --> 600.66
watched that extensively I haven't I

597.899 --> 603.86
have not watched a single frame or sound

600.66 --> 606.7199999999999
bite I've been doing other things

603.86 --> 609.42
mainly sleeping

606.72 --> 612.6600000000001
when it was night uh

609.42 --> 614.76
but yeah yesterday's Flat Earth debate

612.66 --> 618.54
from the Friday show was really good

614.76 --> 622.2
really a lot of fun with listening back

618.54 --> 625.0999999999999
after that I hang or hung around at 24 7

622.2 --> 625.1
Discord again

625.98 --> 630.98
it was

627.959 --> 630.9799999999999
yeah that was good

631.14 --> 635.8199999999999
I I can end up hanging out there pretty

633.779 --> 637.98
long

635.82 --> 640.98
right also

637.98 --> 644.16
Bible literalist did another stream

640.98 --> 646.32
I was there most of yeah I was there the

644.16 --> 649.76
entire time

646.32 --> 649.7600000000001
she was talking about again

652.5 --> 655.16
ah

658.92 --> 662.0
about the Bible

664.8 --> 670.88
that I know for sure

668.459 --> 670.88
hey

679.98 --> 685.22
right no it was titled prophecies so

689.579 --> 693.62
but yeah that was pretty interesting

699.12 --> 705.36
ah I for some reason completely missed

702.959 --> 706.92
out on tea time with Gary and Terry

705.36 --> 709.92
which according to my YouTube

706.92 --> 709.92
notifications

710.04 --> 714.779
was live

711.959 --> 716.3389999999999
I think it was live pretty early

714.779 --> 718.4399999999999
yesterday

716.339 --> 721.2790000000001
anyway I missed it

718.44 --> 721.2790000000001
uh

728.88 --> 734.16
all right yeah a couple of good

731.339 --> 736.139
observational videos

734.16 --> 739.519
Sky free

736.139 --> 739.519
some really nice

740.459 --> 743.8389999999999
well tests

745.8 --> 751.139
with refraction on the small scale

748.86 --> 754.44
like emulating it

751.139 --> 756.9590000000001
and it's really good stuff

754.44 --> 758.94
so check that out it's just a four and a

756.959 --> 763.76
half minute long video

758.94 --> 763.7600000000001
I'll post a link to that oh what's this

764.639 --> 768.5
video accompanying photo

769.019 --> 772.279
okay what is that

783.899 --> 786.56
dude

786.899 --> 789.56
uh-huh

801.24 --> 804.26
yeah but

811.079 --> 814.56
that's

813.36 --> 818.94
look

814.56 --> 821.8389999999999
I don't see how you can call it a photo

818.94 --> 821.839
serious

822.12 --> 830.579
come on this obviously obviously is an

826.5 --> 832.8
artist's right it's an artist picture

830.579 --> 836.8199999999999
like everything you see there makes no

832.8 --> 839.459
freaking sense right this is a painting

836.82 --> 843.12
you can't seriously assume that that is

839.459 --> 846.26
like physically real a visual real

843.12 --> 846.26
photograph come on

849.0 --> 855.06
like even you see the freaking clouds

851.82 --> 858.24
hanging over that disc and not outside

855.06 --> 860.3389999999999
none of it makes any freaking sense okay

858.24 --> 863.72
this is a complete photo it's not a

860.339 --> 863.72
photograph none of it

874.44 --> 878.36
still interesting though you know

881.94 --> 887.0400000000001
but it's a very weird setup

884.94 --> 890.72
it's basically

887.04 --> 895.26
like a rectangular looping setup crammed

890.72 --> 899.94
inside of a disc inside of other things

895.26 --> 901.139
it makes no bloody sense whatsoever none

899.94 --> 903.4200000000001
at all

901.139 --> 906.5
you gotta realize that right seeking

903.42 --> 906.5
star water come on

913.86 --> 918.48
like and even looking at the scale of

916.199 --> 922.8599999999999
what you're seeing right there how could

918.48 --> 926.1
you ever ever Ascend to that height

922.86 --> 929.339
over the region where it's taken from

926.1 --> 931.1990000000001
supposedly based on what is known mainly

929.339 --> 933.36
that it would be a lot colder all right

931.199 --> 937.139
so you get much higher up

933.36 --> 938.94
when it's much colder makes no sense it

937.139 --> 941.94
wouldn't look like this at all it would

938.94 --> 946.019
all be very very freaking hazy because

941.94 --> 948.24
there is a massive massive amount of air

946.019 --> 951.12
to look through

948.24 --> 955.44
so that thing is obviously blatantly

951.12 --> 955.44
obviously in artists painting

956.16 --> 960.68
gonna get some feedback on that saving

958.259 --> 960.6800000000001
star water

975.42 --> 980.4799999999999
all right anyway Neil Constantino right

979.019 --> 982.8
if you got any

980.48 --> 985.259
comments or anything that stood out

982.8 --> 988.279
about the flight from Sydney to Chile

985.259 --> 988.279
that would be great

991.62 --> 995.519
land set

993.54 --> 1000.2199999999999
one

995.519 --> 1000.22
is what the file States

1000.32 --> 1003.82
no conclusion yet

1012.38 --> 1016.72
okay hello one big pond

1016.88 --> 1023.06
I know I have not been told today yeah

1020.66 --> 1027.28
those things

1023.06 --> 1027.28
uh hello Amanda young good to see you

1030.26 --> 1036.02
all right but seeking star water just

1032.539 --> 1038.299
think about every time you see an

1036.02 --> 1042.319
something where you can absolutely

1038.299 --> 1045.74
confirm that it is real footage right

1042.319 --> 1049.46
there's real visuals

1045.74 --> 1051.38
on camera or whatever

1049.46 --> 1054.8600000000001
none of that looks like that picture

1051.38 --> 1057.6200000000001
none of it so that picture is obviously

1054.86 --> 1061.8799999999999
an artist's

1057.62 --> 1064.2199999999998
work it's not a photograph it can't be a

1061.88 --> 1065.8400000000001
photograph it doesn't match the right

1064.22 --> 1069.919
scale

1065.84 --> 1073.299
with anything we've ever seen out there

1069.919 --> 1073.2990000000002
none of it makes any sense

1078.44 --> 1080.799
right

1108.559 --> 1115.0
dude

1111.26 --> 1115.0
you can even see it

1116.48 --> 1122.299
you can even see that it's drawn

1119.66 --> 1124.22
at like the more shady

1122.299 --> 1127.16
photo

1124.22 --> 1130.24
come on can I get a confirmation so you

1127.16 --> 1130.24
can start water come on

1132.86 --> 1136.84
like this is not a photograph

1169.1 --> 1171.58
right

1172.039 --> 1179.179
and now there's this one oh thanks

1176.419 --> 1181.72
oh what a great time to stall

1179.179 --> 1181.72
right

1188.539 --> 1194.539
right because also yeah in in the real

1191.6 --> 1195.9189999999999
world when you look at when you look

1194.539 --> 1199.7
down

1195.919 --> 1204.5
from a huge distance say a thousand

1199.7 --> 1206.8400000000001
miles a thousand mile distance right you

1204.5 --> 1209.96
don't see the countries

1206.84 --> 1212.1789999999999
or the continents being outlined by a

1209.96 --> 1215.8400000000001
white line versus the ocean

1212.179 --> 1217.5800000000002
you don't actually see that in visual

1215.84 --> 1219.26
reality

1217.58 --> 1221.96
all right

1219.26 --> 1225.44

you're like the things you say you might

1332.36 --> 1336.4399999999998
understand what you're saying but

1334.4 --> 1338.9
there's like three completely different

1336.44 --> 1341.24
ways in how to interpret what you're

1338.9 --> 1343.039
saying right now so can you please be a

1341.24 --> 1345.799
little bit more specific so I actually

1343.039 --> 1349.46
understand what you're saying

1345.799 --> 1349.46
right communication

1351.1 --> 1359.6789999999999
pemars posted me what does that mean

1354.86 --> 1359.6789999999999
what does that mean what does that mean

1373.28 --> 1378.9189999999999
okay seeking star water well you can't

1375.62 --> 1381.26
call it a photo it's not a photo

1378.919 --> 1383.2990000000002
it's not a photo it isn't a photo that's

1381.26 --> 1386.179
not a photo

1383.299 --> 1388.34
all right photos doesn't matter what

1386.179 --> 1393.3200000000002
kind of filters you put over there

1388.34 --> 1396.1399999999999
they don't show after a thousand mile

1393.32 --> 1398.8999999999999
distance they don't show you no matter

1396.14 --> 1402.0200000000002
of filters it's going to show you a

1398.9 --> 1404.9
white line surrounding a continent where

1402.02 --> 1408.22
it's separated from the ocean photos

1404.9 --> 1410.96
don't do that ever not a single time

1408.22 --> 1413.6000000000001
that's an artist rendition that's not a

1410.96 --> 1417.6200000000001
matter of filters it's artists work

1413.6 --> 1421.299
somebody took a pencil and Drew that

1417.62 --> 1421.299
right it's not a photo

1424.159 --> 1426.4
foreign

1428.98 --> 1435.02
take this as an offense I'm being a

1432.74 --> 1437.659
little energetic not blaming you it does

1435.02 --> 1439.6399999999999
look very interesting it is fascinating

1437.659 --> 1442.5390000000002
right just like the early globe

1439.64 --> 1446.179
paintings paintings they were paintings

1442.539 --> 1449.12
right you see them sometimes back in the

1446.179 --> 1451.4
really early Hollywood type movies

1449.12 --> 1455.299
that they started up that's a painting

1451.4 --> 1457.64
right it's a painting

1455.299 --> 1459.3799999999999
I'm pretty damn sure that that

1457.64 --> 1461.48
photograph that you claim is a

1459.38 --> 1464.179
photograph that you shared with me is a

1461.48 --> 1467.38
painting I guarantee it

1464.179 --> 1467.38
that's not a photograph

1467.6 --> 1473.059
at that sort of distance you won't see

1470.299 --> 1474.799
[ __ ] no matter if you even have a

1473.059 --> 1477.32
freaking telescope you won't even see

1474.799 --> 1481.059
[ __ ] you can't see anything at that

1477.32 --> 1481.059
distance it's too much air in between

1486.26 --> 1492.039
so get again gonna get some

1488.659 --> 1492.0390000000002
clarification please

1492.5 --> 1496.6
one big pond what did you mean

1504.26 --> 1509.36
I don't understand what it means to be

1506.659 --> 1511.88
posted by somebody else what does that

1509.36 --> 1513.9799999999998
mean can you please be a little specific

1511.88 --> 1515.72
so I actually understand what you're

1513.98 --> 1519.14
saying instead of just

1515.72 --> 1522.039
reading random blurb

1519.14 --> 1522.039
in my chat

1525.98 --> 1531.919
listen to what he says about the image

1529.34 --> 1535.059
right and find if you call it an image

1531.919 --> 1535.0590000000002
it's not a photograph

1556.039 --> 1560.24
is that a joke tomonoid

1570.44 --> 1575.799
and why

1573.02 --> 1575.799
why

1580.34 --> 1584.6589999999999
a video about me okay

1582.679 --> 1587.659

1591.38 --> 1597.98
people out there that are completely out

1593.659 --> 1599.5390000000002
of their minds making videos about me

1597.98 --> 1603.919
right

1599.539 --> 1605.12
among the true the true Pond scumbags

1603.919 --> 1609.5
out there

1605.12 --> 1612.32
they're real really bad bad bad bad news

1609.5 --> 1614.48

like my outbursts

1616.64 --> 1621.919
right

1618.86 --> 1626.059
they don't like my outrage

1621.919 --> 1627.5
while at simultaneously holding on to a

1626.059 --> 1629.96
higher level

1627.5 --> 1632.059
of morality and all that like they

1629.96 --> 1634.7
really [ __ ] hate that that's why I do

1632.059 --> 1636.44
that because I want to drive them nuts

1634.7 --> 1639.14
to the point where they [ __ ] kill

1636.44 --> 1641.539
themselves right there's a lot of really

1639.14 --> 1644.539
[ __ ] possessed people that are never

1641.539 --> 1647.72
gonna be unpossessed in this world and I

1644.539 --> 1650.059
want them to [ __ ] die get the [ __ ]

1647.72 --> 1653.48

everything to Satan now get the [ __ ] out

1653.48 --> 1656.779
of here

1654.5 --> 1659.059

1656.779 --> 1661.58
lot of people that are teachering on

1659.059 --> 1664.94
that edge of like yeah everybody hates

1661.58 --> 1668.36

1664.94 --> 1670.299

videos out there

1674.96 --> 1680.8600000000001
right

1677.36 --> 1680.86
that's partially what it's meant for

1681.98 --> 1686.24
right and at the same time there's

1683.779 --> 1689.899
people in here

1686.24 --> 1694.159
people that I hang around with then get

1689.899 --> 1698.5
to touch the good side of my character

1694.159 --> 1698.5
I try to assist them

1698.779 --> 1705.08
and help them and use my intellect to

1702.26 --> 1707.96
basically clarify certain things for

1705.08 --> 1710.72
them no cost

1707.96 --> 1713.059
I just demand a little respect not even

1710.72 --> 1716.419
I don't even have to have exaggerated

1713.059 --> 1719.559
amounts just a little right

1716.419 --> 1719.5590000000002
that's the other side

1720.039 --> 1726.44
oh saying you want them to die is not a

1723.74 --> 1729.86
good thing man well

1726.44 --> 1733.8990000000001
would you like these [ __ ] up pieces of

1729.86 --> 1736.6399999999999
[ __ ] stalker scumbags pathological lying

1733.899 --> 1738.559
bastards out there that literally make

1736.64 --> 1742.279
it their lives work to make everybody

1738.559 --> 1747.559
they touch upon miserable

1742.279 --> 1749.86
right would you like them to continue on

1747.559 --> 1752.12
right animated

1749.86 --> 1754.399
unstopped nobody's gonna do anything

1752.12 --> 1755.6
about it they are not gonna stop would

1754.399 --> 1759.3799999999999
you like that

1755.6 --> 1762.559
as an alternative Axel Russell

1759.38 --> 1764.779
we gotta unite no they gotta get the

1762.559 --> 1767.6589999999999
[ __ ] out of this world

1764.779 --> 1769.159
and we gotta have enough sensible people

1767.659 --> 1771.38
left

1769.159 --> 1776.0
to actually

1771.38 --> 1779.2990000000002
get out of this Satan satanic grip

1776.0 --> 1782.539
right out of this squeeze

1779.299 --> 1785.36
that's where we gotta be at

1782.539 --> 1790.299
right I I'm not gonna Unite with [ __ ]

1785.36 --> 1790.299
scumbags they can get the [ __ ] out

1791.12 --> 1794.84
right

1792.74 --> 1797.659
because they are completely unreliable

1794.84 --> 1800.059
in everything their total denial about

1797.659 --> 1802.22
everything like no I don't need those

1800.059 --> 1804.32
people I can't use those people nobody

1802.22 --> 1809.72
can they just need to get the [ __ ] out

1804.32 --> 1812.1789999999999
right other than that yeah I'll Unite

1809.72 --> 1814.159
with anybody that's actually freaking

1812.179 --> 1816.679
worth it

1814.159 --> 1819.2600000000002
somebody that actually cares about the

1816.679 --> 1821.96
things that I care about

1819.26 --> 1824.48
oh yeah we gotta love one another right

1821.96 --> 1828.02
yeah I know

1824.48 --> 1831.5
yeah except for [ __ ] demons right

1828.02 --> 1833.779
yeah Jesus didn't tell you to love

1831.5 --> 1837.58
demons did he

1833.779 --> 1837.58
right he kicked them out

1842.24 --> 1847.04
oh he made a video about me no I didn't

1844.64 --> 1849.5590000000002
see that ranty

1847.04 --> 1852.559
[Music]

1849.559 --> 1854.779
I agree they are scums but you know yeah

1852.559 --> 1855.98
but you know but you know yeah no

1854.779 --> 1859.1
tolerance

1855.98 --> 1862.94
yeah do you see the hashtag

1859.1 --> 1867.2199999999998
in my list hashtag intolerance

1862.94 --> 1867.22
right I put that there for a reason

1867.32 --> 1872.779
scumbags that have absolutely no

1870.26 --> 1875.6
redeemable qualities

1872.779 --> 1878.6
yeah [ __ ] them

1875.6 --> 1882.08
you get a life you get some common sense

1878.6 --> 1883.34
and some morality or get the [ __ ] out of

1882.08 --> 1886.399
this world

1883.34 --> 1888.6399999999999
if you're not gonna get that then get

1886.399 --> 1888.6399999999999
out

1899.059 --> 1902.1789999999999
okay I'm not the one that made him like

1901.399 --> 1905.6589999999999
that

1902.179 --> 1908.48
I'm not the one that made them choose

1905.659 --> 1910.3990000000001
to relinquish every human quality they

1908.48 --> 1913.84
ever had

1910.399 --> 1913.84
for whatever reason

1921.98 --> 1928.88
right and hey in my experience when

1925.159 --> 1931.7
people are that far gone that disgusting

1928.88 --> 1934.64
and evil like evil to themselves

1931.7 --> 1936.679
primarily right the greatest evil they

1934.64 --> 1938.0
commit to themselves

1936.679 --> 1941.3200000000002
right

1938.0 --> 1944.12
when somebody's like that the only thing

1941.32 --> 1946.6399999999999
the only thing

1944.12 --> 1950.2399999999998
that could ever get through to them

1946.64 --> 1954.3200000000002
after that is somebody being brutally

1950.24 --> 1956.419
honest and direct and hard on them right

1954.32 --> 1959.059
that's the only thing that gets through

1956.419 --> 1962.96
to those people being nice

1959.059 --> 1965.779
does nothing they see it as literally

1962.96 --> 1971.3600000000001
like growing ground which they can

1965.779 --> 1973.1
invade and leech upon right so [ __ ] the

1971.36 --> 1976.1589999999999
scumbags

1973.1 --> 1978.019
right I kicked them out of my out of my

1976.159 --> 1980.72
church out of my temple

1978.019 --> 1984.3990000000001
right just like Jesus did with certain

1980.72 --> 1984.3990000000001
groups of people right

1984.62 --> 1990.039
let's get consistent here

1987.679 --> 1990.039
right

1992.24 --> 1996.679
Globes can be saved no but I'm not

1994.58 --> 1999.74
talking about Globes I'm talking about

1996.679 --> 2002.44
[ __ ] up scumbags right if they happen

1999.74 --> 2005.14
to also be Global Believers that's

2002.44 --> 2007.659
really not that important right I got

2005.14 --> 2009.8200000000002
plenty of globe Believers in my chat

2007.659 --> 2012.22
that's fine

2009.82 --> 2013.36
right in certain circumstances it can be

2012.22 --> 2015.7
kind of annoying and another

2013.36 --> 2018.36
circumstances it can be great we can

2015.7 --> 2021.1000000000001
actually agree to things outside

2018.36 --> 2023.6789999999999
of the cosmogony

2021.1 --> 2026.1999999999998
and that's good I like that right I'm

2023.679 --> 2029.38
not talking about globers I'm not saying

2026.2 --> 2031.779
Globus you all have to die you're evil

2029.38 --> 2034.0
no I'm not saying that at all talking

2031.779 --> 2036.88
about human behavior

2034.0 --> 2038.98
about being a person in this world

2036.88 --> 2043.38
created by God whether you believe in

2038.98 --> 2043.38
him or not is completely irrelevant

2045.399 --> 2051.2799999999997
right AGM AGM gets it demon infected

2048.879 --> 2054.159
Liars right it's not just demon infected

2051.28 --> 2057.0400000000004
because everybody has their own demons

2054.159 --> 2060.399
that haunt them their own ego that

2057.04 --> 2063.339
demands certain weird [ __ ] from you to

2060.399 --> 2066.5789999999997
express as a party or that you identify

2063.339 --> 2069.159
with it's very it's a life struggle for

2066.579 --> 2071.139
everybody everybody that has half a

2069.159 --> 2073.7200000000003
brain in this world has life struggles

2071.139 --> 2077.02
with their own egos it's a fact it's

2073.72 --> 2079.1189999999997
absolute fact you cannot deny this do

2077.02 --> 2081.579
even superficial studies you will find

2079.119 --> 2083.079
out that that's true right I'm talking

2081.579 --> 2086.2000000000003
about the people

2083.079 --> 2088.7200000000003
that have completely surrendered to the

2086.2 --> 2092.859
Demonic infection that literally vacate

2088.72 --> 2095.74
that no longer have their Spirits seated

2092.859 --> 2098.3199999999997
in their conscious awareness they

2095.74 --> 2101.14
surrender it to autopilot Behavior

2098.32 --> 2103.0
demonic Auto violent Behavior right

2101.14 --> 2106.1189999999997
that's the people I'm talking about

2103.0 --> 2109.839
those are effectively the zombies those

2106.119 --> 2112.3
are the ones only echoing misery

2109.839 --> 2115.0
because they are imprisoned and they

2112.3 --> 2117.42
cannot get back in the hot seat of their

2115.0 --> 2117.42
own body

2117.82 --> 2124.7200000000003
right and to get them back

2120.52 --> 2127.24
takes monstrous struggle and often

2124.72 --> 2131.7999999999997
afterward it's completely thrown into

2127.24 --> 2134.0789999999997
the garbage bin trust me I tried I have

2131.8 --> 2137.079
tried that [ __ ]

2134.079 --> 2139.119
a lot it was actually almost an

2137.079 --> 2141.76
obsessive focus of mine

2139.119 --> 2143.92
because hey I was into kind of weaker

2141.76 --> 2145.96
stuff spiritual stuff chauvinism all

2143.92 --> 2148.42
that way before Flat Earth like I've

2145.96 --> 2149.56
been into that for 20 years guys 20

2148.42 --> 2151.7400000000002
years

2149.56 --> 2153.96
and I've met some people

2151.74 --> 2157.18
that were

2153.96 --> 2159.64
possessed like

2157.18 --> 2163.1189999999997
up yeah I haven't seen anybody like

2159.64 --> 2166.66
twist their neck around 360 degrees or

2163.119 --> 2169.839
anything but other than that yeah

2166.66 --> 2171.22
right like including the freaking puking

2169.839 --> 2173.44
right

2171.22 --> 2176.6189999999997
I've seen that yet

2173.44 --> 2179.56
that's real and I've tried to help some

2176.619 --> 2180.76
of these people out of it but

2179.56 --> 2185.0789999999997
like

2180.76 --> 2187.48
if they like you can't really do it

2185.079 --> 2189.6400000000003
because if somebody's like really

2187.48 --> 2192.22
seriously possessed and it's kind of

2189.64 --> 2193.54
worth getting them out then that

2192.22 --> 2196.54
possession

2193.54 --> 2199.24
is just too strong for a singular

2196.54 --> 2202.48
individual to basically remove it

2199.24 --> 2206.2799999999997
because you might and like relieve the

2202.48 --> 2208.9
burden that's causing it to be there

2206.28 --> 2211.2000000000003
temporarily in somebody like literally

2208.9 --> 2214.599
just relieving their stress

2211.2 --> 2216.8199999999997
visually not sexually or anything just

2214.599 --> 2219.2200000000003
all kinds of way and spiritual like

2216.82 --> 2221.8590000000004
cleaning it up like therapy effect

2219.22 --> 2223.24
spiritual therapy I've done that right

2221.859 --> 2224.7999999999997
it works

2223.24 --> 2228.2799999999997
but

2224.8 --> 2230.8
then once they have to basically

2228.28 --> 2234.099
take off the ring and throw it in the

2230.8 --> 2235.7200000000003
volcano guess what happens guess what

2234.099 --> 2237.579
happens

2235.72 --> 2239.68
no

2237.579 --> 2242.38
and everything was for absolutely

2239.68 --> 2244.5989999999997
nothing right I've seen this happen

2242.38 --> 2247.54
multiple times

2244.599 --> 2249.579
you can't once people are so far

2247.54 --> 2251.74
possessed

2249.579 --> 2253.7200000000003
that they are going to have that effect

2251.74 --> 2256.359
that as soon as you clean them up they

2253.72 --> 2258.8199999999997
put it right back on like knowingly

2256.359 --> 2261.8199999999997
they'll stare you in the eye and with a

2258.82 --> 2264.7000000000003
grin on their face say no

2261.82 --> 2268.6600000000003
right those people and there's a lot of

2264.7 --> 2272.2599999999998
them are completely [ __ ] they will

2268.66 --> 2275.5
never get out of it ever until they die

2272.26 --> 2277.599
and maybe Beyond Death they will still

2275.5 --> 2280.0
be stuck I don't know I can't tell that

2277.599 --> 2282.339
but I fear that [ __ ]

2280.0 --> 2285.46
right there's nothing you could do about

2282.339 --> 2288.22
that it's just nothing

2285.46 --> 2289.54
once somebody's completely under control

2288.22 --> 2291.8799999999997
over

2289.54 --> 2293.92
if within their ego and they don't have

2291.88 --> 2296.6800000000003
control over themselves anymore and they

2293.92 --> 2299.26
like it right because demons that

2296.68 --> 2303.0989999999997
possess you also provide physical

2299.26 --> 2306.76
pleasure and Consciousness burden relief

2303.099 --> 2309.339
right artificial relief basically guess

2306.76 --> 2312.3390000000004
what it's freaking addictive

2309.339 --> 2314.04
right it's addictive to be like that

2312.339 --> 2317.74
that's why

2314.04 --> 2319.599
no that's why they put it right back on

2317.74 --> 2321.7
as soon as they could

2319.599 --> 2326.38
could let it go they put it right back

2321.7 --> 2328.96
on right it's it's beyond addiction

2326.38 --> 2330.1600000000003
like basic addiction is like behavioral

2328.96 --> 2333.28
right

2330.16 --> 2337.5989999999997
that's pretty tough well people that are

2333.28 --> 2341.6800000000003
like possessed it's addiction times 10.

2337.599 --> 2345.04
it gets really really close it's it's

2341.68 --> 2347.8799999999997
literally just yeah Beyond addiction it

2345.04 --> 2347.88
takes over everything

2348.099 --> 2354.6400000000003
and there's multiple people out there

2351.4 --> 2357.64
that suffer from this and they just rage

2354.64 --> 2361.7799999999997
on all day long

2357.64 --> 2365.2
Ray John disrupt their pure aramone like

2361.78 --> 2367.7200000000003
in spiritual terminology pure ariman

2365.2 --> 2370.359
just death only death it's like and that

2367.72 --> 2374.2
is the only thing that can break him

2370.359 --> 2376.3199999999997
free right only death can release them

2374.2 --> 2378.7599999999998
this is what aramon does once everyone

2376.32 --> 2382.3
completely gets in

2378.76 --> 2385.7400000000002
there's no way back there's no way back

2382.3 --> 2385.7400000000002
but through death itself

2387.88 --> 2391.26
now you can test this [ __ ]

2391.839 --> 2394.839
anyway

2395.38 --> 2402.06
hello Dutch sailor so that is the reason

2398.38 --> 2402.06
why I do say that [ __ ]

2402.52 --> 2409.54
do you think there is a downward bias no

2405.64 --> 2412.359
no this bladder Spritz no there's not a

2409.54 --> 2414.2799999999997
downward bias downward bias is for the

2412.359 --> 2415.839
dance

2414.28 --> 2419.099
literally

2415.839 --> 2419.099
and metaphorically

2427.119 --> 2431.04
there's no downward bias

2442.18 --> 2446.5
if all the sudden Brave parts are gone I

2444.94 --> 2448.319
think we would be very close to Harmony

2446.5 --> 2452.56
in absolute peace

2448.319 --> 2455.88
oh you wish Dutch sailor you wish no no

2452.56 --> 2455.88
no I'm afraid not

2456.339 --> 2463.42
I'm afraid not you see

2459.7 --> 2465.7599999999998
once you tap societally into certain

2463.42 --> 2467.619
levels of Darkness then you can't

2465.76 --> 2471.6400000000003
technically remove it

2467.619 --> 2474.52
but just like the metaphor of the Ring

2471.64 --> 2476.92
of Power having it put on

2474.52 --> 2479.5
yeah you can get it off

2476.92 --> 2481.839
but you'll never forget it

2479.5 --> 2485.38
and so being confronted with all this

2481.839 --> 2488.819
[ __ ] is gonna find its way back

2485.38 --> 2491.579
so even if we basically

2488.819 --> 2494.619
exterminate the the

2491.579 --> 2495.579
monsters that are like at the in the hot

2494.619 --> 2498.6600000000003
seat

2495.579 --> 2501.1600000000003
staring all this forcing it out right

2498.66 --> 2503.56
forcing out the extermination of

2501.16 --> 2506.56
humanity and all that through divide and

2503.56 --> 2508.48
conquer through absolute lies

2506.56 --> 2510.2799999999997
gaslighting

2508.48 --> 2511.599
once they've been unseated it's not

2510.28 --> 2515.1600000000003
gonna be over

2511.599 --> 2518.1400000000003
because they have seated themselves

2515.16 --> 2520.48
in probably more than half the world

2518.14 --> 2521.68
population spiritually

2520.48 --> 2523.9
right

2521.68 --> 2526.5
unfortunately

2523.9 --> 2526.5
like

2526.9 --> 2532.359
right it the damage is already done this

2530.56 --> 2533.44
can't be fixed anymore

2532.359 --> 2535.56
but

2533.44 --> 2539.8
if we let it continue

2535.56 --> 2542.14
then the damage will be absolute

2539.8 --> 2544.0600000000004
and then can never be recovered from

2542.14 --> 2545.56
ever

2544.06 --> 2547.599
right ever

2545.56 --> 2549.4
like there will be no Humanity left if

2547.599 --> 2552.2200000000003
we leave this just going like the way it

2549.4 --> 2555.52
is none none like there will be only

2552.22 --> 2557.5
hate only hate only like oh you see a

2555.52 --> 2559.72
human you kill it

2557.5 --> 2562.0
that's where it's going to lead to if we

2559.72 --> 2564.22
let this continue

2562.0 --> 2567.04
but if we get rid of it and there's a

2564.22 --> 2569.56
good chance it will happen

2567.04 --> 2571.06
then it's not over and it's not

2569.56 --> 2573.4
certainly everybody's gonna come back

2571.06 --> 2577.2999999999997
Kumbaya no no because when that happens

2573.4 --> 2582.2200000000003
then sadly the contrast will form again

2577.3 --> 2584.619
children will make their decision again

2582.22 --> 2588.7799999999997
it's gonna happen again

2584.619 --> 2588.78
right it doesn't stop

2588.819 --> 2593.859
is it even worse

2591.099 --> 2595.2400000000002
it will no if we stop it it's not going

2593.859 --> 2597.5789999999997
to be even worse

2595.24 --> 2599.859
then we still have a chance Humanity

2597.579 --> 2602.98
that is life

2599.859 --> 2605.7999999999997
but it's not going to be over it's just

2602.98 --> 2609.52
gonna be the first strike

2605.8 --> 2612.1600000000003
the strike that basically changes things

2609.52 --> 2614.74
then you get the aftermath which lasts

2612.16 --> 2618.2799999999997
at least 10 times longer

2614.74 --> 2620.68
right ten times dude

2618.28 --> 2623.6800000000003
there's so much damage there's so much

2620.68 --> 2627.66
deprogramming there's so many things

2623.68 --> 2631.18
spiritually culturally lost like

2627.66 --> 2635.16
completely lost so lost that even if you

2631.18 --> 2640.18
see it back in old video you won't even

2635.16 --> 2642.5789999999997
recognize what it is that lost

2640.18 --> 2645.94
right

2642.579 --> 2648.4
the damage is massive

2645.94 --> 2653.079
culturally and spiritually the damage

2648.4 --> 2653.079
that's been done is already massive

2653.38 --> 2658.599
through societal

2655.5 --> 2661.72
indoctrination conditioning schooling

2658.599 --> 2663.04
just personal demonic Behavior and the

2661.72 --> 2665.8799999999997
tolerance of it

2663.04 --> 2665.88
all of that

2670.119 --> 2677.1400000000003
right but hey what do you want you know

2674.079 --> 2679.48
you want to pretend

2677.14 --> 2682.2999999999997
like it's not that bad and just continue

2679.48 --> 2684.46
on until you realize that the final

2682.3 --> 2685.9
moment is there and all life is going to

2684.46 --> 2690.4
end forever

2685.9 --> 2693.4
because you couldn't handle the truth

2690.4 --> 2695.859
or we gonna get together and stop it no

2693.4 --> 2698.14
matter the cost because the cost is

2695.859 --> 2700.0
already like the cost is already going

2698.14 --> 2701.859
to be paid anyway

2700.0 --> 2703.599
right

2701.859 --> 2705.7
we don't know anything and everything is

2703.599 --> 2708.099
lost so

2705.7 --> 2710.98
right might just as well just give it

2708.099 --> 2714.28
your all at least give it a shot think

2710.98 --> 2717.42
the Creator would appreciate that

2714.28 --> 2722.099
we finally stuck up

2717.42 --> 2722.099
for what needs to be stuck up for

2727.72 --> 2730.02
right

2732.04 --> 2739.38
but it has to start with the age of

2736.119 --> 2742.98
communist tolerance ending

2739.38 --> 2742.98
completely ending

2744.4 --> 2747.88
right just

2749.56 --> 2754.02
yeah now I'll stop it at that

2760.06 --> 2763.38
oh Nathan r

2763.96 --> 2766.26
uh

2771.28 --> 2776.98
right but yeah every time people oh you

2774.46 --> 2779.26
shouldn't say that no but there are some

2776.98 --> 2781.599
really [ __ ] up people out there and

2779.26 --> 2785.4
they like to come by my by my show

2781.599 --> 2785.4
typically it's my curse

2785.619 --> 2791.619
and yeah I will say that they need to

2788.92 --> 2794.26
get the [ __ ] out of this world

2791.619 --> 2798.9
because there's nowhere else to go but

2794.26 --> 2798.9
there but down down to Hell

2800.8 --> 2807.099
I'm not gonna hold them back right

2805.24 --> 2810.339
like some

2807.099 --> 2813.76
desperate mother who's just trying to

2810.339 --> 2816.4
protect like their kid or whatever even

2813.76 --> 2819.94
though they know that's a psychopathic

2816.4 --> 2822.2200000000003
murdering monster right yeah they might

2819.94 --> 2824.56
still protect it because they just can't

2822.22 --> 2827.02
stop their mother instinct right it's

2824.56 --> 2829.2999999999997
very tragic

2827.02 --> 2834.18
but you know

2829.3 --> 2834.1800000000003
it can never end well you know it

2838.359 --> 2844.119
right and these people most of them

2841.24 --> 2846.7799999999997
they're not gonna they're not gonna turn

2844.119 --> 2846.78
around right

2847.24 --> 2852.0989999999997
if they make it everything at home if

2849.339 --> 2854.02
they just avoid information

2852.099 --> 2855.7000000000003
there's no real there's nothing to

2854.02 --> 2859.18
relinquish

2855.7 --> 2862.0
now if they have trouble letting certain

2859.18 --> 2864.22
facts and all that get through and they

2862.0 --> 2866.38
get really angry and AD homie that's

2864.22 --> 2868.1189999999997
different that's different that's just

2866.38 --> 2870.28
something in that moment they can't

2868.119 --> 2872.6800000000003
handle and they're

2870.28 --> 2874.5400000000004
having struggles with it and then they

2872.68 --> 2876.7
can get really mean spirited and

2874.54 --> 2879.42
personal as kind of a defensive reaction

2876.7 --> 2879.4199999999996
that's different

2881.26 --> 2884.8
right

2882.7 --> 2886.0
that's not the people those are not the

2884.8 --> 2889.1400000000003
people I'm talking about I'm talking

2886.0 --> 2891.819
about those that will not even go to

2889.14 --> 2895.359
facts or anything they will not discuss

2891.819 --> 2899.2599999999998
anything anymore they just want somebody

2895.359 --> 2902.2599999999998
that does that to go away they want to

2899.26 --> 2905.76
take us out they really do

2902.26 --> 2905.76
like they have no

2905.92 --> 2909.42
nothing to hold them back

2910.72 --> 2916.839
from basically going there and saying

2914.14 --> 2918.7599999999998
that right just like I am like okay the

2916.839 --> 2920.619
demon possessed they need to get the

2918.76 --> 2922.42
[ __ ] out of this world well they think

2920.619 --> 2925.0
the opposite they think that anybody

2922.42 --> 2927.16
that is not demon possessed should get

2925.0 --> 2930.46
out of this world and they will back it

2927.16 --> 2933.16
up and they will do it right and every

2930.46 --> 2935.98
time they do it and you look at it and

2933.16 --> 2938.14
do nothing they grow stronger and more

2935.98 --> 2940.8
evil

2938.14 --> 2940.7999999999997
you understand

2945.94 --> 2949.66
hello chapinator

2951.819 --> 2956.94
I hope you have a great day today yeah

2953.619 --> 2956.94
thanks I will probably

2964.18 --> 2968.74
so any other comments

2967.359 --> 2970.98
don't even remember what I was talking

2968.74 --> 2970.9799999999996
about

2982.66 --> 2989.5789999999997
all right if you kill them you may come

2985.48 --> 2993.66
like them well that depends on why

2989.579 --> 2993.6600000000003
self-defense is a virtue

2999.16 --> 3002.5989999999997
and he atheists here

3003.98 --> 3007.05
[Music]

3009.83 --> 3013.119
[Music]

3015.0 --> 3017.78
huh

3043.559 --> 3048.3190000000004
all right

3045.3 --> 3048.319
but uh

3050.22 --> 3054.74
did I just kill the mood now

3054.96 --> 3059.07
because everybody seems to be gone off

3056.819 --> 3062.189
all of a sudden

3059.07 --> 3062.1890000000003
[Music]

3068.46 --> 3072.5
so Ralph Rodriguez

3085.92 --> 3089.66
right talking about

3088.04 --> 3094.22
controversial

3089.66 --> 3097.6189999999997
mainstream controversy did anybody see

3094.22 --> 3102.0
ridiculous situation

3097.619 --> 3104.1600000000003
the supposed White lives matter protests

3102.0 --> 3106.74
from the KKK I don't even know if they

3104.16 --> 3109.5589999999997
were really involved it's so stupid like

3106.74 --> 3111.7799999999997
every time I see this [ __ ] so stupid

3109.559 --> 3114.5400000000004
and then like I don't know black lives

3111.78 --> 3117.2400000000002
matters or whatever they they went

3114.54 --> 3120.0589999999997
against one another so look yeah looking

3117.24 --> 3124.22
at two stupid controlled opposition

3120.059 --> 3124.2200000000003
groups going at one another basically

3125.46 --> 3129.9
that's funny

3127.2 --> 3131.64
because over at Alex Jones they wanted

3129.9 --> 3136.38
to emphasize

3131.64 --> 3141.14
The Clash well over at Russia today they

3136.38 --> 3141.1400000000003
emphasized how incredibly failed it was

3142.559 --> 3147.78
like nobody came up came showing up

3145.92 --> 3150.079
pretty much that's what they said about

3147.78 --> 3150.079
it

3150.42 --> 3154.38
whatever

3152.28 --> 3157.88
trying to get something started here

3154.38 --> 3157.88
conversation would be great

3164.0 --> 3168.78
so much bad stuff happens in Earth

3166.559 --> 3171.8390000000004
unfortunately I sometimes feel like

3168.78 --> 3175.28
giving up on civilization what

3171.839 --> 3175.2799999999997
what civilization

3179.339 --> 3184.339
where's this civilization you speak of

3187.619 --> 3192.6800000000003
I mean the autopilot [ __ ] train

3195.24 --> 3201.8999999999996
right the a moral civilization where

3199.559 --> 3203.88
people literally don't know what the

3201.9 --> 3208.26
hell they're doing and they can be

3203.88 --> 3211.6800000000003
driven to any level be made to stoop to

3208.26 --> 3216.079
any level and they don't even realize it

3211.68 --> 3216.0789999999997
I don't call that Civilization at all

3219.359 --> 3224.7599999999998
I think that better terminology would be

3221.76 --> 3224.76
uncivilization

3226.94 --> 3230.079
[Music]

3238.8 --> 3242.7200000000003
hey Aaron Brown good to see you

3256.2 --> 3258.3799999999997
foreign

3302.819 --> 3306.2599999999998
all right dead sailor

3311.7 --> 3316.5589999999997
oh it's good to have you this

3314.04 --> 3318.04
the first hour at least thanks for being

3316.559 --> 3321.179
there

3318.04 --> 3321.179
[Music]

3323.46 --> 3326.119
uh

3334.74 --> 3337.74
foreign

3342.5 --> 3348.02
I think they have like a new nest in the

3345.359 --> 3348.02
chimney there

3348.14 --> 3356.359
hey oh thank you very much Nathan r

3352.5 --> 3356.359
for the 10 super chat donation

3356.819 --> 3360.48
that's nice

3358.44 --> 3362.64
yeah if you really want to help me out

3360.48 --> 3365.22
by the way financially please consider

3362.64 --> 3368.7599999999998
donating to my PayPal instead because

3365.22 --> 3371.339
the Super Chat I receive less than three

3368.76 --> 3374.2400000000002
percent of that eventually and it takes

3371.339 --> 3374.24
a long time too

3375.299 --> 3379.099
I appreciate the gesture

3400.68 --> 3405.1189999999997
right

3402.9 --> 3407.579
well the Sailor

3405.119 --> 3409.6800000000003
there's at least one thing you can kind

3407.579 --> 3413.76
of like Trust on and that is that

3409.68 --> 3414.96
satanic worshipers eventually always end

3413.76 --> 3418.38
up

3414.96 --> 3421.099
well destroying themselves like

3418.38 --> 3421.099
guaranteed

3423.18 --> 3427.5589999999997
yeah Tom Parker it is a rip-off but it's

3425.579 --> 3428.94
due to my financial circumstances

3427.559 --> 3431.7000000000003
remember

3428.94 --> 3435.2000000000003
I'm on social welfare I have to report

3431.7 --> 3435.2
my income from Google

3435.599 --> 3440.339
to

3437.04 --> 3442.319
the government and then they take it out

3440.339 --> 3445.5
they take out

3442.319 --> 3448.44
what I made and I received like three

3445.5 --> 3451.74
percent at Max it's nothing right that's

3448.44 --> 3454.799
because that's the reason why if if I

3451.74 --> 3459.319
didn't have social welfare then then I

3454.799 --> 3459.319
would get like seven seventy percent

3464.04 --> 3469.02
swearing too much

3466.5 --> 3471.559
me swearing too much Neil what what are

3469.02 --> 3471.559
you talking about

3475.98 --> 3479.819
but they don't destroy themselves the

3478.859 --> 3482.52
day

3479.819 --> 3485.66
when they start yeah that's right

3482.52 --> 3488.819
but that's because it's a test look

3485.66 --> 3490.859
satanists are like an infection it's an

3488.819 --> 3492.96
inflammation right when you get an

3490.859 --> 3494.7599999999998
inflammation yeah the body has to

3492.96 --> 3497.099
respond there's going to be effect

3494.76 --> 3499.6800000000003
there's going to be burden side effects

3497.099 --> 3501.7200000000003
a test but it's also a test on the

3499.68 --> 3504.54
entire immune system

3501.72 --> 3509.339
it's

3504.54 --> 3511.619
part of the freaking design guys

3509.339 --> 3514.0789999999997
I don't know why

3511.619 --> 3516.78
but that's the way it works

3514.079 --> 3519.2400000000002
and apparently if you take them out

3516.78 --> 3523.079
really really quickly

3519.24 --> 3525.8999999999996
as I presume the Nazis actually did

3523.079 --> 3528.599
right for everything they did wrong

3525.9 --> 3531.359
I'm pretty sure they immediately went

3528.599 --> 3533.76
after the satanists

3531.359 --> 3536.0589999999997
right because they were at the root of

3533.76 --> 3539.599
literally trying to absolutely

3536.059 --> 3539.599
annihilate their country

3539.76 --> 3543.38
after the first World War

3544.099 --> 3550.6800000000003
slotted with porn and just get people

3547.02 --> 3551.94
literally start start up transsexualism

3550.68 --> 3553.799
and all that

3551.94 --> 3556.319
really messed up

3553.799 --> 3558.42
so I'm pretty sure they got taken out

3556.319 --> 3560.7599999999998
first

3558.42 --> 3563.46
and

3560.76 --> 3565.6800000000003
well wouldn't surprise me if a lot of

3563.46 --> 3568.559
those satanists were actually part of

3565.68 --> 3570.839
Jewish families right it's a bit of an

3568.559 --> 3573.78
issue

3570.839 --> 3576.54
and that's how it came to that scenario

3573.78 --> 3578.4
because immediately if you take out

3576.54 --> 3581.46
quick

3578.4 --> 3583.38
it's like that energy the inflammation

3581.46 --> 3587.52
energy

3583.38 --> 3589.88
it continues on after you take it out

3587.52 --> 3593.839
it doesn't go away

3589.88 --> 3593.839
that's the problem

3594.48 --> 3599.64
that's the main problem it's like

3596.52 --> 3602.52
something spiritually karmic it's

3599.64 --> 3606.48
that's the main problem if that problem

3602.52 --> 3608.4
wasn't there then man what then there

3606.48 --> 3610.319
would be no Satanist because they would

3608.4 --> 3613.14
immediately get taken out but the

3610.319 --> 3615.48
problem is is that as soon as they're

3613.14 --> 3618.0
they're sliding in as soon as they've

3615.48 --> 3619.859
gotten into that and they start to open

3618.0 --> 3623.46
up and show it

3619.859 --> 3626.16
you can't take them out because

3623.46 --> 3627.839
it's like when you strike them down they

3626.16 --> 3630.42
become more powerful than ever before

3627.839 --> 3631.859
because now they're already dead there's

3630.42 --> 3633.92
nothing you can take from them but

3631.859 --> 3638.16
everything they've done and their spirit

3633.92 --> 3641.96
moves on continue doing damage

3638.16 --> 3641.96
well if the person's still alive

3647.52 --> 3654.079
it's different it's complicated it

3650.579 --> 3654.079
really is complicated I

3661.98 --> 3667.44
cursing a lot is bad for your health

3663.96 --> 3670.5
well that depends on how you curse like

3667.44 --> 3672.42
what it means to you what are you gonna

3670.5 --> 3675.18
do what is coming out of you what is the

3672.42 --> 3678.839
intention what is the existential

3675.18 --> 3681.3799999999997
intention right every intention has a

3678.839 --> 3681.38
consequence

3683.46 --> 3688.26
so if you're cursing something what are

3685.68 --> 3690.7799999999997
you trying to achieve with the cursing

3688.26 --> 3693.3590000000004
right cursing can be just

3690.78 --> 3695.7000000000003
blanks when you're just venting

3693.359 --> 3698.04
aggression and then immediately as soon

3695.7 --> 3700.74
as it's out try to recover and restore

3698.04 --> 3702.96
that's different as to when you're

3700.74 --> 3708.5589999999997
really trying to curse and just saying

3702.96 --> 3708.559
like no you you are this problem

3710.099 --> 3715.94
I'm gonna pile it all on you

3713.04 --> 3715.94
that's different

3721.44 --> 3726.299
they're like cancer cells they evade

3723.9 --> 3729.539
immune system what

3726.299 --> 3732.5389999999998
I don't know what you're talking about

3729.539 --> 3735.78
as far as I'm concerned cancer cells are

3732.539 --> 3737.4
part of the immune system

3735.78 --> 3738.8390000000004
right

3737.4 --> 3741.599
it's just that

3738.839 --> 3743.7599999999998
people don't get it anymore they don't

3741.599 --> 3746.88
understand it and they're being too like

3743.76 --> 3749.28
oh my God I have a little little pain oh

3746.88 --> 3750.799
my God immediately the medicine and

3749.28 --> 3755.1600000000003
surgery and

3750.799 --> 3757.619
attack the pain attack it no murder the

3755.16 --> 3760.819
cause like that's the attitude that

3757.619 --> 3760.819
makes it all a problem right

3765.48 --> 3770.76
it's just people have become so

3767.579 --> 3773.3390000000004
absolutely wusses

3770.76 --> 3775.5
pampered little babies they don't know

3773.339 --> 3777.66
how to handle pain anymore because

3775.5 --> 3781.799
they're freaking wussies and they're

3777.66 --> 3783.66
stupid they're afraid of pain yeah if

3781.799 --> 3787.44
you're afraid of pain you got a [ __ ]

3783.66 --> 3792.48
problem buddy because life is partially

3787.44 --> 3795.7400000000002
pain it's it's ordained by God there's

3792.48 --> 3799.26
nothing you can do to it to stop it

3795.74 --> 3801.7799999999997
accept surrender to Satan who will give

3799.26 --> 3806.039
you this False Image that you can escape

3801.78 --> 3808.619
that yeah yeah and that's how you get

3806.039 --> 3810.8590000000004
there you get it that's how you get

3808.619 --> 3810.859
there

3825.119 --> 3832.2000000000003
I have the show on Bose speaker on the

3828.66 --> 3834.839
whole job site it's very okay Neil I did

3832.2 --> 3836.46
know that a lot of guys keep up the good

3834.839 --> 3839.22
work

3836.46 --> 3843.059
try not to get too distracted oh yeah

3839.22 --> 3845.16
and the Earth is flat it's flat

3843.059 --> 3849.0
thank God it's flat or construction

3845.16 --> 3850.799
would be a serious pain in the ass

3849.0 --> 3853.14
right because then you would have to

3850.799 --> 3855.96
build everything based on the radius of

3853.14 --> 3858.92
Earth so thank God it's all flat makes

3855.96 --> 3858.92
it so much easier

3861.42 --> 3864.5190000000002
[Music]

3899.339 --> 3902.7
all right well I don't know monk Patrol

3901.2 --> 3906.8999999999996
Maybe

3902.7 --> 3911.22
depends on how she dealt with it

3906.9 --> 3914.1600000000003
did she get that cancer and then went to

3911.22 --> 3916.859
the doctor got all kinds of medicines

3914.16 --> 3919.5589999999997
and surgeries and all that [ __ ] and then

3916.859 --> 3922.02
she died or did she get it not go to the

3919.559 --> 3925.38
doctor say go screw yourselves I'm just

3922.02 --> 3927.5389999999998
gonna continue the way I am

3925.38 --> 3930.96
then it's something else right because

3927.539 --> 3934.98
yeah you can still die right

3930.96 --> 3938.0
and that is part of the design you still

3934.98 --> 3938.0
die at some point

3938.4 --> 3942.2400000000002
right but it depends a lot on what you

3941.22 --> 3945.359
do

3942.24 --> 3949.2599999999998
what kind of garbage you're convinced to

3945.359 --> 3953.2799999999997
inject and take into your body

3949.26 --> 3956.4
right a lot of cancer right let's just

3953.28 --> 3958.619
start it differently cancer is something

3956.4 --> 3962.52
you're born with

3958.619 --> 3964.799
20 different varieties seated in your

3962.52 --> 3968.819
body as part of your metabolic design

3964.799 --> 3969.96
and you have it at all times never goes

3968.819 --> 3972.299
away

3969.96 --> 3974.46
thank God it never goes away you know

3972.299 --> 3975.78
why because it's an inherent part of

3974.46 --> 3978.119
your body

3975.78 --> 3980.46
it's part of your immune system of your

3978.119 --> 3983.2200000000003
metabolism it's supposed to be there

3980.46 --> 3985.26
yeah and suffer and Agony yeah what the

3983.22 --> 3987.5389999999998
[ __ ] monk Patrol that's right suffering

3985.26 --> 3990.48
[ __ ] Agony pain that's right it's

3987.539 --> 3993.1800000000003
part of God it's part of overcoming life

3990.48 --> 3995.16
issues psychological issues learn the

3993.18 --> 3997.5589999999997
German new medicine yeah

3995.16 --> 4000.859
painful that's right

3997.559 --> 4003.26
it all depends on what led up to that

4000.859 --> 4005.98
how they were they eating how were they

4003.26 --> 4009.559
living were they taking any medications

4005.98 --> 4012.02
right what kind of medications

4009.559 --> 4014.42
who was their doctor

4012.02 --> 4016.88
did they have any doctor

4014.42 --> 4020.359
what is their attitude all these things

4016.88 --> 4024.26
matter everything matters right

4020.359 --> 4026.72
yeah get the [ __ ] over it [ __ ]

4024.26 --> 4028.94
yeah my mother died from cancer too

4026.72 --> 4031.0989999999997
although probably not cancer it was

4028.94 --> 4034.099
blatantly obvious she was just

4031.099 --> 4037.1600000000003
completely overdosing on pharmaceutical

4034.099 --> 4040.48
medication of all kinds right and that

4037.16 --> 4042.74
[ __ ] her up so badly a long alongside

4040.48 --> 4045.619
psychological issues

4042.74 --> 4047.8999999999996
that she got cancer she could have

4045.619 --> 4049.46
probably survived that with some real

4047.9 --> 4051.319
tough times

4049.46 --> 4053.799
she couldn't handle it she couldn't

4051.319 --> 4056.96
handle it she got surgery the surgery

4053.799 --> 4060.619
botched and guess what happens when you

4056.96 --> 4061.7
go into cancer surgery and it botches

4060.619 --> 4064.339
yeah

4061.7 --> 4067.0989999999997
cancer gets extremely aggressive and

4064.339 --> 4069.5
then you [ __ ] die yeah that's what

4067.099 --> 4071.9
happens my mother died from that and she

4069.5 --> 4072.799
suffered yeah so don't you [ __ ] tell

4071.9 --> 4076.1600000000003
me

4072.799 --> 4078.68
with Mr outrage yeah I can [ __ ] talk

4076.16 --> 4082.16
about this because it's my own [ __ ]

4078.68 --> 4085.46
family yeah I was freaking there I was

4082.16 --> 4088.2799999999997
there bastard where were you where were

4085.46 --> 4092.859
you ass wipe

4088.28 --> 4092.8590000000004
[ __ ] you [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out

you're literally disgusting dude

4132.14 --> 4136.9400000000005
everything about you is disgusting you

4134.779 --> 4139.52
are one of these [ __ ] satanists I'm

4136.94 --> 4141.0199999999995
talking about that needs to get the [ __ ]

4139.52 --> 4142.64
out of this world because there's no

monk Patrol none whatsoever I've never

4145.759 --> 4152.96
seen you say anything ever that gave me

4150.44 --> 4155.719
some kind of impression that you might

4152.96 --> 4160.699
have some kind of spiritual Sparkle left

4155.719 --> 4160.699
in you you are a vacated scumbag

4162.14 --> 4169.58
I'm glad you call yourself monk Patrol

4165.679 --> 4171.819
you are literally a scumbag do you get

4169.58 --> 4171.8189999999995
that

4180.14 --> 4182.319
foreign

4194.62 --> 4200.0
anything created oh really so how about

4197.719 --> 4202.34
a unique individual

4200.0 --> 4205.04
when they're born how about freaking

4202.34 --> 4207.46
kids with telepathy

4205.04 --> 4207.46
right

4207.62 --> 4214.34
you made that oh it just came by all by

4211.64 --> 4218.659000000001
itself all the extra dimensional

4214.34 --> 4220.58
Timeless thing but just happened to just

4218.659 --> 4224.78
come out of nothing

4220.58 --> 4228.5
it's just random bacteria and then

4224.78 --> 4230.84
some fish and then a bird and or a

4228.5 --> 4233.06
lizard and then a bird and or whatever a

4230.84 --> 4235.46
monkey and then somebody fell out of the

4233.06 --> 4238.400000000001
monkey butt and then you ascended and

4235.46 --> 4241.179
became a inter-dimensional Timeless

4238.4 --> 4244.94
Spirit right

4241.179 --> 4247.4
yeah yeah because everything comes out

4244.94 --> 4250.12
of absolutely nothing right

4247.4 --> 4253.82
if you can demonstrate that in anything

4250.12 --> 4256.28
in anything ever that everything can

4253.82 --> 4257.179
come out in nothing wish you the best of

4256.28 --> 4259.159
luck

4257.179 --> 4262.28
because that doesn't even slide in

4259.159 --> 4264.5199999999995
freaking General philosophy okay it's so

4262.28 --> 4264.5199999999995
stupid

4266.79 --> 4269.97
[Music]

4272.3 --> 4279.5
for reactions or real so how does

4274.699 --> 4282.0199999999995
chemical reaction lead to design right

4279.5 --> 4284.3
and who who made it

4282.02 --> 4286.820000000001
who arranged things

4284.3 --> 4289.88
to have chemical reactions

4286.82 --> 4291.799999999999
right why does it work that way why are

4289.88 --> 4293.36
there such things as chemical reactions

4291.8 --> 4298.04
right

4293.36 --> 4300.98
and how did the microbiology systems

4298.04 --> 4304.04
that are still to this day so

4300.98 --> 4307.159
complicated that even tens of thousands

4304.04 --> 4309.58
of people highly professional studying

4307.159 --> 4313.58
the human body

4309.58 --> 4316.58
still can't even figure it out oh really

4313.58 --> 4321.0199999999995
that just happened to arrive by

4316.58 --> 4323.0599999999995
coincidence out of a pool of Goo really

4321.02 --> 4326.659000000001
really

4323.06 --> 4329.54
how do things design themselves

4326.659 --> 4331.219
Jazz X how do things design themselves

4329.54 --> 4334.88
how does that work

4331.219 --> 4337.9
how can something design itself

4334.88 --> 4337.900000000001
how does that work

4340.76 --> 4345.02
how could it have known where it would

4343.159 --> 4348.5599999999995
eventually go

4345.02 --> 4352.040000000001
in order to have like Offspring already

4348.56 --> 4354.080000000001
have everything they needed in order to

4352.04 --> 4355.76
achieve where they would be going how

4354.08 --> 4357.82
does that work

4355.76 --> 4362.06
how does that work with random

4357.82 --> 4366.139999999999
coincidence based Evolution right yeah

4362.06 --> 4370.219
no it doesn't work at all right there is

4366.14 --> 4374.2390000000005
no I evolution

4370.219 --> 4376.52
there is no inner air evolution

4374.239 --> 4379.159
there is no

4376.52 --> 4381.92
that for crying I would like the pineal

4379.159 --> 4384.62
gland like what the [ __ ] you really

4381.92 --> 4387.679
think that just happened to come and

4384.62 --> 4389.719
into existence out of nothing just like

4387.679 --> 4392.4800000000005
that with everything that comes with it

4389.719 --> 4396.08
is totally ridiculous what natural

4392.48 --> 4397.218999999999
selection survival of the fittest the

4396.08 --> 4401.239
fittest

4397.219 --> 4404.12
are merciless brutal killers

4401.239 --> 4406.58
right if it was just survival of the

fittest there would be nothing there

4406.58 --> 4410.42
would only be juggernauts of Destruction

4408.92 --> 4412.28
and that's it

4410.42 --> 4415.1
there would be nothing there would be

4412.28 --> 4417.5599999999995
subtlety

4415.1 --> 4420.820000000001
doesn't survive

4417.56 --> 4423.5
right when it's survival of the fitness

4420.82 --> 4425.719
it doesn't work at all

4423.5 --> 4429.1
Pioneer Blended get the [ __ ] out of here

I don't have time for that [ __ ]

4453.8 --> 4459.02
especially if you're gonna spam my chat

4455.84 --> 4460.82
for that garbage right

4459.02 --> 4462.8
you have not made a single argument

4460.82 --> 4464.96
you're just saying yeah this works that

4462.8 --> 4467.54
worked this happened that happened no

4464.96 --> 4470.12
proof zero proof there is no proof for

4467.54 --> 4474.26
evolution right evolution

4470.12 --> 4478.5199999999995
is the second most disproven

4474.26 --> 4480.820000000001
supposed scientific theory ever devised

4478.52 --> 4484.280000000001
you know what the number one

4480.82 --> 4485.96
disproven Theory every devised this the

4484.28 --> 4487.46
Earth being a globe

4485.96 --> 4490.28
right

4487.46 --> 4492.92
it's that stupid

4490.28 --> 4496.099999999999
when there's too many signs too many

4492.92 --> 4498.62
structures too many insights that

4496.1 --> 4501.14
disprove something you gotta let it go

4498.62 --> 4502.82
because if you don't you enter the realm

4501.14 --> 4505.76
of Satan

4502.82 --> 4508.4
yeah and I don't give a [ __ ] if you

4505.76 --> 4512.0
don't believe in that and neither does

4508.4 --> 4515.599999999999
he because he will gladly take your

4512.0 --> 4518.06
stupid ignorance and take you and take

4515.6 --> 4520.52
you and toy with you and shove you

4518.06 --> 4523.580000000001
wherever you're gonna go because you

4520.52 --> 4527.92
can't see it anymore because you chose

4523.58 --> 4527.92
ignorance over knowledge

4531.88 --> 4538.46
no inserting a god little G God do don't

4536.42 --> 4540.32
do that right

4538.46 --> 4543.44
creation

4540.32 --> 4544.719
there is only creation things cannot

4543.44 --> 4548.599999999999
happen

4544.719 --> 4550.159
randomly there is no Randomness random

4548.6 --> 4553.6990000000005
doesn't exist

4550.159 --> 4557.54
right the concept of Random

4553.699 --> 4562.339999999999
is very easily redefined as something

4557.54 --> 4564.86
you don't understand the structure of

4562.34 --> 4568.28
right and then seems random then it

4564.86 --> 4570.92
seems chaos chaos is basically a lack of

4568.28 --> 4574.159
insight that's the only thing it is

4570.92 --> 4577.64
because in actuality it doesn't exist

4574.159 --> 4583.42
nothing is random nothing is chaos

4577.64 --> 4583.42
only the mind will perceive it as chaos

4590.38 --> 4596.54
and that's fine because we have our

4593.719 --> 4598.28
limitations with because of the

4596.54 --> 4600.739
interface

4598.28 --> 4603.0199999999995
the physical

4600.739 --> 4604.459999999999
so there is supposed to be blacks there

4603.02 --> 4606.080000000001
is supposed to be things we don't have

4604.46 --> 4608.06
grip on they're supposed to be

4606.08 --> 4609.14
limitations it's part of the learning

4608.06 --> 4611.6
process

4609.14 --> 4613.280000000001
right you can never fully understand

4611.6 --> 4616.719
everything

4613.28 --> 4616.719
because then we couldn't do anything

4633.199 --> 4635.44
foreign

4639.699 --> 4645.98
I don't give a [ __ ] dude I literally

4643.1 --> 4648.02
don't care right it's up to you if you

4645.98 --> 4651.08
don't want to believe it

4648.02 --> 4654.7390000000005
fine go to hell then

4651.08 --> 4658.1
I don't give a [ __ ] I'm not gonna give a

4654.739 --> 4659.659
[ __ ] if you don't want to believe it you

4658.1 --> 4663.6990000000005
understand

4659.659 --> 4663.699
you don't care then I don't care

4663.86 --> 4670.719
right it's your [ __ ] problem

4667.82 --> 4670.719
not mine

4682.0 --> 4686.92
that's right Aaron Brown it's all just

4684.38 --> 4686.92
algorithm

4691.4 --> 4696.259999999999
random is not random

4693.62 --> 4699.14
it's never random

4696.26 --> 4702.4400000000005
there's always a distinct pattern to

4699.14 --> 4705.5
everything it's just that the scale of

4702.44 --> 4709.5199999999995
it the scale of the complexity May

4705.5 --> 4711.92
simply not be worth trying to oversee

4709.52 --> 4713.84
right and then it's just oh yeah you're

4711.92 --> 4715.76
gonna just call it chaos or random and

4713.84 --> 4717.89
that's fine right because we have

4715.76 --> 4721.1
limitations

4717.89 --> 4721.1
[Music]

4730.78 --> 4735.679
I don't really care for your personal

4733.52 --> 4738.38
relationship

4735.679 --> 4741.26
with any God right whether you ignore

4738.38 --> 4744.14
him or believe it that's up to you

4741.26 --> 4747.08
I'm just pointing at that's very nice

4744.14 --> 4749.780000000001
that you choose to ignore him and ignore

4747.08 --> 4752.0
his existence and try to reason your his

4749.78 --> 4755.139999999999
yeah your way

4752.0 --> 4758.179
reason God out of your way literally

4755.14 --> 4761.54
doesn't work though because everything

4758.179 --> 4763.9400000000005
can only ever have been in coming into

4761.54 --> 4766.3
existence through creation and through

4763.94 --> 4766.299999999999
design

4766.88 --> 4771.14
can't be any other way there is no way

4769.94 --> 4774.44
that anything

4771.14 --> 4778.96
here could have originated

4774.44 --> 4778.96
from nothing it's impossible

4781.28 --> 4786.188999999999
ontological primitive

4783.12 --> 4786.189
[Music]

4800.3 --> 4804.8
what about the Big Bang

4802.699 --> 4807.5
stupid concept

4804.8 --> 4810.860000000001
and it's like it's not even 100 years

4807.5 --> 4813.62
old it's a really dumb thing

4810.86 --> 4814.639
made up by some Jesuit priest didn't you

4813.62 --> 4817.4
know

4814.639 --> 4820.2390000000005
in the 20th century

4817.4 --> 4820.239
it's really stupid

4824.54 --> 4831.44
like even if I'd gotten into the concept

4827.84 --> 4833.92
of the Big Bang there is so much wrong

4831.44 --> 4836.36
with it so much

4833.92 --> 4839.0
unbelievable amounts of wrong with it

4836.36 --> 4841.58
and I have addressed that

4839.0 --> 4844.159
I've addressed what is wrong with the

4841.58 --> 4846.8
big bang like even if you presuppose the

4844.159 --> 4849.5599999999995
freaking everything then at every

4846.8 --> 4852.62
[ __ ] step it goes wrong it doesn't

4849.56 --> 4856.04
work nothing makes any [ __ ] sense it

4852.62 --> 4859.219
can't happen that way like no amount of

4856.04 --> 4862.04
technical geometrical

4859.219 --> 4865.34
any sort of emulation will make it work

4862.04 --> 4867.44
it's a science fiction story it's

4865.34 --> 4871.2390000000005
fantasy it's the only thing it can ever

4867.44 --> 4871.239
be it can never work

4871.28 --> 4877.639
even if you presuppose everything it can

4874.219 --> 4880.639
work right that's just like how gas

4877.639 --> 4883.6990000000005
pressure supposedly being held on a ball

4880.639 --> 4885.679
through gravity right but then when you

4883.699 --> 4887.719
look into the technicals

4885.679 --> 4890.54
or you look into that when you look into

4887.719 --> 4892.1
the details oh guess what gravity if

4890.54 --> 4894.26
you're consider it a force it's not even

4892.1 --> 4897.7390000000005
a force but if you consider it a force

4894.26 --> 4899.42
it's a weak Force gas pressure expansion

4897.739 --> 4902.12
within the volume of the container which

4899.42 --> 4905.06
is assumed to be endless volume right

4902.12 --> 4907.159
outer space endless folio yeah

4905.06 --> 4908.2390000000005
considered one of the strongest forces

4907.159 --> 4911.96
known

4908.239 --> 4914.718999999999
right even then within the presupposed

4911.96 --> 4917.719
mechanics and setup it can't work right

4914.719 --> 4918.679
gravity cannot hold gas pressure onto a

4917.719 --> 4922.58
ball

4918.679 --> 4924.92
it's impossible right that's just one

4922.58 --> 4928.34
little Factor there's one little element

4924.92 --> 4931.2390000000005
in the entire mechanism right and the

4928.34 --> 4933.62
same goes for the Big Bang it's so

4931.239 --> 4936.58
Preposterous everything about it is

4933.62 --> 4936.58
stupid everything

4943.04 --> 4948.2789999999995

[Music]

4962.0 --> 4968.0
could God have designed a big bag No

4964.639 --> 4970.88
no because it's [ __ ] lies

4968.0 --> 4973.76
and lies are the domain of somebody else

4970.88 --> 4976.52
if you know what I mean

4973.76 --> 4977.659000000001
Fantastical [ __ ] lies there's only

4976.52 --> 4981.56
one

4977.659 --> 4985.299999999999
spirit that deals in that sort of thing

4981.56 --> 4985.3
right and it's not the Creator

5003.12 --> 5010.96
are we just create [ __ ] no that's

5006.88 --> 5014.58
not creation creation is not just a

5010.96 --> 5019.0
random word it's not the happening right

5014.58 --> 5022.719
creation is called creation not the

5019.0 --> 5026.8
happening it's creation when things get

5022.719 --> 5030.699
made that were before not right creation

5026.8 --> 5033.1
not the happening it's creation

5030.699 --> 5037.62
creation for a reason because something

5033.1 --> 5037.620000000001
got created where before there was none

5049.69 --> 5056.489
[Music]

5072.4 --> 5074.58

5176.26 --> 5179.26
foreign

5181.12 --> 5184.5
and back

5185.739 --> 5188.739
ah

5190.0 --> 5196.32
I can

5192.46 --> 5196.32
pull around with this for a moment

5197.62 --> 5203.4
oh did that work

5200.56 --> 5203.400000000001
no

5204.46 --> 5207.54
what is this

5227.92 --> 5231.179
why isn't this working

5246.4 --> 5250.839999999999
or maybe it's because it's not okay

5248.44 --> 5253.9
let's let's try it out for a second

5250.84 --> 5256.0
yeah all right I have to

5253.9 --> 5258.28
initialize it

5256.0 --> 5260.26
since we're talking about creation and

5258.28 --> 5263.139
the big bang and [ __ ]

5260.26 --> 5265.92
why not put a little different visual in

5263.139 --> 5265.92
there for a second

5267.04 --> 5272.679
I forget it you know it's like even when

5269.62 --> 5276.659
I get pissed off I I like forget like oh

5272.679 --> 5276.659
wait I got other animations too

5294.219 --> 5300.34
is creation Magic

5297.58 --> 5302.92
or are they two separate things what now

5300.34 --> 5305.26
we're talking about the creation as in

5302.92 --> 5306.46
the establishment of everything that we

5305.26 --> 5309.58
know

5306.46 --> 5313.06
and the design I prefer to call it the

5309.58 --> 5314.86
design because that's unmistakable right

5313.06 --> 5319.4800000000005
that's where the intelligence come in

5314.86 --> 5324.299999999999
there's no a design without intelligence

5319.48 --> 5324.299999999999
but in general it's called creation

5335.199 --> 5341.099999999999
right and I'm not about the uh that word

5338.26 --> 5341.1
stupid

5352.659 --> 5359.44
I prefer a more direct form of spells

5356.679 --> 5362.5
through words and direct meaning and

5359.44 --> 5364.599999999999
just purpose in the moment right my

5362.5 --> 5366.88
magic comes through truth

5364.6 --> 5368.139
through in the moment directness of

5366.88 --> 5371.26
spirit

5368.139 --> 5373.179
no holding back just the raw spirit and

5371.26 --> 5375.52
who knows man there might be people

5373.179 --> 5378.28
watching me following me that are having

5375.52 --> 5379.719
all kinds of unique inter-dimensional

5378.28 --> 5382.36
experiences

5379.719 --> 5384.82
because of it because of my directness

5382.36 --> 5386.139
because I'm literally opening up these

5384.82 --> 5388.54
Gates

5386.139 --> 5390.6990000000005
from within on the spirit level where

5388.54 --> 5392.92
people can interface if they have the

5390.699 --> 5395.0199999999995
faculties if they have the courage

5392.92 --> 5397.38
they can literally do all kinds of

5395.02 --> 5397.38
things

5399.28 --> 5404.44
right as far as I allow it

5401.98 --> 5408.9
information sharing it's the spirit the

5404.44 --> 5408.9
internet spirit and I am open for that

5419.38 --> 5422.9400000000005
okay right

5423.46 --> 5426.06
foreign

5451.38 --> 5458.1990000000005
yeah thanks it's it's not my own making

5455.739 --> 5462.48
George Sanford Adam found it but yeah

5458.199 --> 5462.48
it's pretty cool I got more too you know

5466.54 --> 5469.679
see what else I got

5479.32 --> 5483.219
right

5480.699 --> 5486.599999999999
isn't this one amazing I don't think

5483.219 --> 5486.6
I've ever shown this before even

5493.84 --> 5498.4800000000005
but this one's Gonna Get You dizzy over

5496.239 --> 5498.48
time

5510.58 --> 5513.54
now what's this

5514.9 --> 5519.46
huh

5517.36 --> 5523.839999999999
all right yeah that doesn't fully work

5519.46 --> 5526.3
with The Arc the arch in front of it

5523.84 --> 5528.400000000001
but yeah I got a whole bunch of really

5526.3 --> 5531.54
cool background pictures

5528.4 --> 5531.54
let's see this one

5533.8 --> 5537.4800000000005
oh yeah I got some watery stuff

5537.639 --> 5543.34
but this is a little gray though so

5540.159 --> 5546.839999999999
let's get back to the uh

5543.34 --> 5546.84
the winter Doom

5553.16 --> 5557.98
[Music]

5554.98 --> 5557.98
hey

5565.6 --> 5572.08
oh wow look at that

5568.719 --> 5574.42
that's freaking amazing

5572.08 --> 5577.719
the way it looks

5574.42 --> 5580.9
how blue that is

5577.719 --> 5583.9
and then like the haze over there and

5580.9 --> 5588.0
still clouds you know

5583.9 --> 5588.0
it's really beautiful out there I know

5600.4 --> 5602.58
foreign

5614.94 --> 5622.138999999999
let's get back to

5618.28 --> 5622.139
the original Mountain View

5644.08 --> 5649.679
what's wrong with spiders tiny Womble

5646.739 --> 5652.659
spiders are awesome

5649.679 --> 5654.52
spiders eat freaking mosquitoes and

5652.659 --> 5657.0599999999995
flies

5654.52 --> 5657.06
right

5660.28 --> 5663.04
like

5661.36 --> 5666.639
I don't know but

5663.04 --> 5669.699
spiders are not hostile

5666.639 --> 5672.04
like really like you may think they're

5669.699 --> 5674.08
creepy and yeah Arachnophobia it's a

5672.04 --> 5675.94
thing I know some people like get really

5674.08 --> 5680.139
freaked out by it

5675.94 --> 5681.339999999999
but I like spiders like I'm not afraid

5680.139 --> 5684.639
of them

5681.34 --> 5687.219
spiders are especially the bigger ones

5684.639 --> 5689.86
they're like they have an instinct and

5687.219 --> 5691.4800000000005
in a way it's not that different from

5689.86 --> 5693.4
animal

5691.48 --> 5695.259999999999
right in other ways it's completely

5693.4 --> 5697.42
different especially like when it

5695.26 --> 5700.42
concerns food and all that but the

5697.42 --> 5701.9800000000005
spider knows you're a mammal

5700.42 --> 5704.9400000000005
it knows

5701.98 --> 5708.718999999999
it's not gonna be stupid right

5704.94 --> 5708.719
insects are not stupid

5711.219 --> 5718.0
like they don't have

5714.48 --> 5719.739
intellectual engagement really but

5718.0 --> 5722.02
they're not stupid they don't have

5719.739 --> 5727.08
stupid instincts

5722.02 --> 5727.080000000001
and they have like energy sensory

5728.26 --> 5732.76
so if you just have respect for it just

5731.08 --> 5735.4
like with all the other forms of life

5732.76 --> 5736.96
it's not gonna get in your way

5735.4 --> 5740.739
like I

5736.96 --> 5743.199
I like spiders and I'm like happy when a

5740.739 --> 5745.9
spider decides to basically set up shop

5743.199 --> 5747.879999999999
in my room inside of it because then

5745.9 --> 5749.44
they eat the freaking mosquitoes that

5747.88 --> 5752.02
are not invited

5749.44 --> 5753.82
right but I keep my window open so they

5752.02 --> 5757.0
because of the fresh air so they always

5753.82 --> 5758.92
slip in especially during the summer

5757.0 --> 5761.26
and I'm just really happy there are

5758.92 --> 5763.96
spiders out there

5761.26 --> 5768.179
because I prefer spiders hanging around

5763.96 --> 5768.179
than getting bit by mosquitoes

5769.06 --> 5771.9400000000005
all right hey hello Julio paben good

5771.04 --> 5774.84
morning

5771.94 --> 5774.839999999999
good to see you

5795.699 --> 5798.099999999999
this part does our fine as long as

5797.08 --> 5801.34
they're not

5798.1 --> 5804.639
near or on me right Aaron Brown I get

5801.34 --> 5807.400000000001
that I get that but look it's not even

5804.639 --> 5810.219
that bad if you're just prepared for it

5807.4 --> 5813.04
like yeah I get it if you're just like

5810.219 --> 5814.659
not expecting a spider and then suddenly

5813.04 --> 5816.58
it turns one is on your shoulder yeah

5814.659 --> 5818.799999999999
they can freak you even I can get

5816.58 --> 5820.36
shocked by that right it's like ah what

5818.8 --> 5821.139
is that because you don't know what it

5820.36 --> 5823.239
is

5821.139 --> 5825.6990000000005
what if it's like a really poisonous one

5823.239 --> 5828.879999999999
or something yeah it's instinct

5825.699 --> 5831.54
but as long as you can just see him like

5828.88 --> 5831.54
I don't mind

5837.76 --> 5843.280000000001
but yeah they don't typically start

5840.52 --> 5845.26
walking over me or anything

5843.28 --> 5847.36
like they just know like okay we're

5845.26 --> 5849.6990000000005
gonna sit in the corners and then

5847.36 --> 5851.08
eventually make a spider web and then

5849.699 --> 5853.0599999999995
some

5851.08 --> 5855.94
flying thingies are probably gonna get

5853.06 --> 5858.219
in it and I'm like yes yes

5855.94 --> 5861.839999999999
thank you spiders for taking care of the

5858.219 --> 5861.84
stupid flies and mosquitoes

5862.719 --> 5866.699
and they're happy because they have food

5867.46 --> 5873.58
and I don't have to feel like oh I just

5869.98 --> 5876.28
killed a creature for my own convenience

5873.58 --> 5878.32
which always makes me feel bad

5876.28 --> 5880.92
like even if it's a really sucky

5878.32 --> 5880.92
creature

5888.88 --> 5894.82
right yeah Aaron Brown absolutely bats

5892.119 --> 5898.42
bats are freaking awesome

5894.82 --> 5901.42
like there's there's bat nests

5898.42 --> 5905.34
in the forest like over there they hang

5901.42 --> 5908.38
them up like little bed bed cabinets

5905.34 --> 5910.900000000001
they look like little boxes

5908.38 --> 5914.32
with the logo of a bat on it so you know

5910.9 --> 5916.119
it's a bad nest and every night when

5914.32 --> 5919.299999999999
it's warm enough yeah they come

5916.119 --> 5921.58
typically right around here in a circle

5919.3 --> 5924.34
they fly around and they just

5921.58 --> 5927.04
like there's bats right in front of me

5924.34 --> 5928.78
there in the night it's really awesome

5927.04 --> 5931.119
and yeah they scoop up all the

5928.78 --> 5934.3
mosquitoes are great

5931.119 --> 5937.96
holy [ __ ] Julio pebbin

5934.3 --> 5939.46
300 snakes is it isn't that a little

5937.96 --> 5942.34
excessive

5939.46 --> 5945.46
or do you own a snake pit

5942.34 --> 5948.88
for just in case

5945.46 --> 5951.639
sheesh 300 snakes that's

5948.88 --> 5955.06
that's a lot

5951.639 --> 5957.46
that's like this room filled up

5955.06 --> 5959.1990000000005
like half a meter high filled up with

5957.46 --> 5961.679
snakes you can make quite a snake bit

5959.199 --> 5961.678999999999
with that

5962.26 --> 5965.219
foreign

5971.94 --> 5978.28
yeah but they only

5975.28 --> 5981.759999999999
eat walking insects they yeah they're

5978.28 --> 5984.28
not gonna catch flying creatures

5981.76 --> 5988.1990000000005
so yeah they eat but they yeah they also

5984.28 --> 5988.199
eat beetles and all kinds of stuff

5990.04 --> 5996.42
right a chicken is not gonna catch

5992.739 --> 5996.419999999999
mosquitoes or flies

5997.96 --> 6002.699
I breed them it's your business all

6000.0 --> 6005.28
right all right that that makes a little

6002.699 --> 6008.159
more sense then I'd be kind of worried

6005.28 --> 6010.28
if it wasn't business like what do you

6008.159 --> 6012.96
got to do with 300 snakes

6010.28 --> 6014.34
if it's not business

6012.96 --> 6016.8
uh

6014.34 --> 6020.1
all right do you deal in

6016.8 --> 6022.38
are you like a snake poison provider for

6020.1 --> 6026.179
cures too and all that is that your

6022.38 --> 6026.179
business because I heard that happens

6030.139 --> 6033.51
phobia what is that

6032.219 --> 6035.4
but it's archive

6033.51 --> 6038.58
[Music]

6035.4 --> 6042.138999999999
our cap oh no our ARCA

6038.58 --> 6042.139
what is that a menu

6042.239 --> 6045.959999999999
or do you mean arachnophobia

6047.119 --> 6053.119
non-poisons

6048.84 --> 6053.119000000001
all right so you you breed them for pets

6057.6 --> 6062.2390000000005
or Boaz and all that right

6071.46 --> 6074.0
hmm

6074.83 --> 6080.3
[Music]

6077.58 --> 6080.3
huh

6081.719 --> 6084.719
nice

6086.4 --> 6091.619
that's hilarious there's a mom like

6088.619 --> 6091.619
bicycling

6092.159 --> 6096.96
on like a bicycle with a with a cart in

6095.1 --> 6098.6
front of it and there's like six little

6096.96 --> 6103.76
kids sitting in it

6098.6 --> 6103.76
it's a lot of kiss on one bite

6105.84 --> 6110.6990000000005
it's really cute

6108.3 --> 6113.52
let's show it

6110.699 --> 6115.94
you guys see that I had some too much in

6113.52 --> 6115.9400000000005
the distance

6117.6 --> 6122.52
just like this plastic enclosure so it

6120.84 --> 6126.139
almost looks like a

6122.52 --> 6126.139
a bicycle boat ride

6126.9 --> 6129.619
hilarious

6140.46 --> 6146.42
ball python morphs

6142.98 --> 6146.419999999999
okay I'll Google that

6158.159 --> 6163.5599999999995
oh wow

6160.92 --> 6166.6990000000005
oh those are quite beautiful like

6163.56 --> 6166.6990000000005
pattern snakes

6166.8 --> 6173.400000000001
so you you basically breed and sell

6170.4 --> 6173.4
decorative

6173.46 --> 6177.9
snake pets

6176.4 --> 6182.0
that's quite

6177.9 --> 6182.0
that's really beautiful some of these

6186.48 --> 6189.98
present that for a second

6193.38 --> 6196.28
right this

6197.219 --> 6199.88
pretty cool

6235.139 --> 6240.36
she is 80

6237.3 --> 6243.659000000001
000. holy [ __ ] dude

6240.36 --> 6245.699
that's that's an expensive freaking

6243.659 --> 6249.5
snake

6245.699 --> 6249.5
the like a collector's item

6250.26 --> 6255.659000000001
right I do hope they actually use them

6252.6 --> 6258.06
for pets right and not for the leather

6255.659 --> 6260.339999999999
because yeah if they have really amazing

6258.06 --> 6263.119000000001
looking skin

6260.34 --> 6263.119000000001
I don't know

6264.0 --> 6268.76
or is that illegal

6266.04 --> 6268.76
I don't know

6279.48 --> 6285.199
do you only sell them for pets or also

6282.42 --> 6285.1990000000005
for skin

6290.76 --> 6293.4800000000005
to a dog

6294.54 --> 6298.08
foreign

6295.4 --> 6299.82
[Music]

6298.08 --> 6303.119
yeah

6299.82 --> 6305.48
you seem like a chihuahua guy to me tiny

6303.119 --> 6305.48
Womble

6321.0 --> 6327.719
right yeah I'm I'm not a dog eye at all

6324.26 --> 6329.88
like I like dogs I just don't like to be

6327.719 --> 6332.94
responsible for them

6329.88 --> 6336.719
I I can I can handle dogs I just

6332.94 --> 6339.839999999999
Labrador okay that's a that's a nice dog

6336.719 --> 6341.82
nice swimmer dog they're really really

6339.84 --> 6345.659000000001
nice

6341.82 --> 6347.34
the most amazing characters

6345.659 --> 6348.46
great for kids

6347.34 --> 6350.28
too

6348.46 --> 6354.08
[Music]

6350.28 --> 6354.08
but I'm more of a cat guy

6354.36 --> 6359.159
although I haven't had a new cat since

6356.76 --> 6360.96
my old one died because that was kind of

6359.159 --> 6363.36
like my familiar

6360.96 --> 6366.6
I

6363.36 --> 6368.339999999999
I mean I don't just take having a cat

6366.6 --> 6373.76
lightly

6368.34 --> 6373.76
it's like a real serious thing to me

6374.159 --> 6377.82
but I do take care of like the

6376.139 --> 6381.679
neighboring cats

6377.82 --> 6381.679
that sometimes come by to visit

6385.679 --> 6393.6
and there's just this one amazing white

6390.139 --> 6397.38
minksy type cat that's a real Hunter by

6393.6 --> 6402.320000000001
the way it's always like fooling around

6397.38 --> 6402.32
out there that one is like so awesome

6402.9 --> 6406.638999999999
it's like a real real cat

6409.92 --> 6415.32
and he's completely like purely white

6413.04 --> 6419.0
everything about him

6415.32 --> 6419.0
maybe albino I don't know

6419.1 --> 6421.820000000001
they have red eyes

6423.92 --> 6427.219
I don't remember

6428.34 --> 6433.58
I should pay attention next time

6431.04 --> 6433.58
thank you

6434.58 --> 6437.239
all right

6447.42 --> 6452.4800000000005
right

6449.1 --> 6452.4800000000005
so anyway

6452.699 --> 6457.638999999999
the show is almost go getting at an end

6464.1 --> 6469.679
talked about quite a few things today

6467.34 --> 6472.7390000000005
nice and fluid

6469.679 --> 6475.6990000000005
at the lots of chat participation I

6472.739 --> 6475.699
really appreciate that

6483.54 --> 6488.219
although for some reason the upvotes

6486.0 --> 6489.6
today are just not working I don't know

6488.219 --> 6492.659
how that is

6489.6 --> 6495.6
only says three upvotes not that it

6492.659 --> 6498.36
really matters it's just like what

6495.6 --> 6502.4400000000005
there's been at least

6498.36 --> 6504.599999999999
like at least 10 cool people in the chat

6502.44 --> 6506.339999999999
a bunch of Squirt boys do

6504.6 --> 6508.7390000000005
and probably a whole bunch of them

6506.34 --> 6512.28
hanging back there

6508.739 --> 6515.04
but I don't know I thought I saw more

6512.28 --> 6516.719
upvotes earlier and then suddenly

6515.04 --> 6519.719
they're gone again

6516.719 --> 6522.3
so maybe YouTube just decided you're not

6519.719 --> 6526.699
supposed to upvote this this is a bad

6522.3 --> 6526.6990000000005
man you not up for Batman

6527.639 --> 6532.46
but anyway yeah do please check your

6530.04 --> 6532.46
votes

6536.52 --> 6540.84
are we done with housekeeping question

6538.619 --> 6543.78
no the housekeeping questions are going

6540.84 --> 6546.9800000000005
to start actually in about 10 minutes of

6543.78 --> 6546.98
read the Flat Earth debate

6548.58 --> 6551.76
and I haven't really addressed them

6550.619 --> 6555.5599999999995
today

6551.76 --> 6555.56
talked about creation a lot

6556.679 --> 6562.52
and pets

6559.32 --> 6562.5199999999995
little creatures

6563.88 --> 6569.76
all right yeah the title I I I made this

6567.599 --> 6573.2390000000005
title refraction cannot unbend light

6569.76 --> 6575.639
because that's a new realization

6573.239 --> 6578.098999999999
it's been there before I'm just now

6575.639 --> 6579.0
starting to see the true significance of

6578.099 --> 6580.92
it

6579.0 --> 6583.739
of this effect

6580.92 --> 6586.1990000000005
that refraction can never unband light

6583.739 --> 6589.339999999999
it can only bend it

6586.199 --> 6589.339999999999
so that means

6590.4 --> 6596.94
if light for whatever reason is being

6593.82 --> 6601.38
bent because of a medium

6596.94 --> 6604.259999999999
then there is no effect that can unbend

6601.38 --> 6607.1990000000005
it back to straight

6604.26 --> 6608.9400000000005
or seemingly straight that's not a thing

6607.199 --> 6612.419999999999
that can actually happen

6608.94 --> 6616.199
with Optics how about that

6612.42 --> 6618.659
and I still remember and this is a long

6616.199 --> 6622.138999999999
long freaking time ago like more than 20

6618.659 --> 6625.138999999999
years ago like in in the 90s

6622.139 --> 6627.54
with my Ray tracing experiments on my

6625.139 --> 6629.219
computer my Amiga 1200.

6627.54 --> 6632.04
and

6629.219 --> 6634.139
also remembering physics in school with

6632.04 --> 6635.58
Optics we had little Optics

6634.139 --> 6638.46
and yes

6635.58 --> 6640.5599999999995
if light goes through a medium a

6638.46 --> 6641.88
different medium like a glass block or

6640.56 --> 6644.820000000001
whatever

6641.88 --> 6646.5
it's either going to go perfectly

6644.82 --> 6648.78
straight through it if it's lined up

6646.5 --> 6652.44
perfectly or if it's not lined up

6648.78 --> 6653.58
perfectly it's going to bend it more

6652.44 --> 6657.839999999999
right

6653.58 --> 6659.179
so this medium alteration through which

6657.84 --> 6663.96
life passes

6659.179 --> 6667.619
will always bend it more

6663.96 --> 6670.86
nevertheless it never

6667.619 --> 6673.44
is like oh the angle comes in and then

6670.86 --> 6675.739
it turns it into straight that never

6673.44 --> 6675.739
happens

6677.34 --> 6681.2390000000005
so yeah that's something that kind of

6679.32 --> 6684.0
stood out to me and I think that

6681.239 --> 6686.04
going to try to remember that as a

6684.0 --> 6688.56
separate concept because it's really

6686.04 --> 6691.0199999999995
these types of things it's like yeah

6688.56 --> 6692.6990000000005
this is something that

6691.02 --> 6694.8
comes out of

6692.699 --> 6696.9
physical testing and demonstrating

6694.8 --> 6701.6990000000005
things to yourself

6696.9 --> 6704.699
a realization refraction cannot unband

6701.699 --> 6706.919999999999
light it can only bend it so if there's

6704.699 --> 6710.699
taking if there's refraction taking

6706.92 --> 6711.4800000000005
place it's always going to distort The

6710.699 --> 6715.199
View

6711.48 --> 6716.339999999999
never on this started

6715.199 --> 6719.04
right

6716.34 --> 6721.860000000001
and that's weirdly enough something that

6719.04 --> 6723.179
terrestrial refraction the concept for

6721.86 --> 6726.199
the ballers

6723.179 --> 6729.0
to justify why the Horizon is not

6726.199 --> 6731.04
abiding by the spherical geometric

6729.0 --> 6733.02
standard that it should on the ball

6731.04 --> 6736.199
Earth

6733.02 --> 6737.719
why it looks so flat right well it

6736.199 --> 6740.339999999999
requires

6737.719 --> 6745.44
refraction that terrestrial refraction

6740.34 --> 6748.139
it requires light to be unbent

6745.44 --> 6751.259999999999
to

6748.139 --> 6753.4400000000005
basically order itself

6751.26 --> 6755.2390000000005
from a

6753.44 --> 6759.36
deviation

6755.239 --> 6760.739
non-straight into a seemingly straight

6759.36 --> 6763.92
feel

6760.739 --> 6766.32
and that is

6763.92 --> 6769.26
physically impossible

6766.32 --> 6772.739
because refraction cannot unband light

6769.26 --> 6775.56
it can only bend it more

6772.739 --> 6777.9
right so I hope that I didn't spend a

6775.56 --> 6781.38
lot of time today on this is talking

6777.9 --> 6784.32
more about snakes and spiders and

6781.38 --> 6787.02
cats and dogs

6784.32 --> 6789.96
but it is still a worthy thing to take

6787.02 --> 6793.080000000001
note of to remember a little arwenian

6789.96 --> 6794.4
factoid and it's not I'm just bringing

6793.08 --> 6795.96
it up that's why I'm calling it our

6794.4 --> 6797.759999999999
wedding because I like to think I'm

6795.96 --> 6800.58
typically doing that

6797.76 --> 6804.4800000000005
it's not something I made up I'm pretty

6800.58 --> 6807.42
sure that this is absolute fact

6804.48 --> 6808.919999999999
maybe a law one could say It's Our

6807.42 --> 6811.1990000000005
Winning law

6808.92 --> 6814.08
in within physics

6811.199 --> 6815.46
right if you can disprove me

6814.08 --> 6818.04
properly

6815.46 --> 6820.56
seriously because this is not about oh

6818.04 --> 6824.099
Flat Earth this is about physics right

6820.56 --> 6827.580000000001
so if I'm incorrect you can

6824.099 --> 6829.32
literally prove that I would like to

6827.58 --> 6831.179
know about it because I'm pretty sure

6829.32 --> 6833.58
it's impossible with everything I've

6831.179 --> 6835.7390000000005
learned about light going through

6833.58 --> 6839.34
changing mediums

6835.739 --> 6842.759999999999
right bending of light due to refraction

6839.34 --> 6845.400000000001
it always bends it more it never bends

6842.76 --> 6847.139
it less it never turns it from a corner

6845.4 --> 6848.82
into straight

6847.139 --> 6851.88
it always

6848.82 --> 6854.04
aggravates the angle

6851.88 --> 6856.139
the exit angle right that's what I've

6854.04 --> 6859.619
learned about refraction every form of

6856.139 --> 6864.26
refraction so yeah therefore one should

6859.619 --> 6864.259999999999
conclude refraction cannot unbend light

6867.659 --> 6873.239
AGM don't order from Pizza Hut just make

6871.02 --> 6875.9400000000005
your own pizza man I make my own pizza

6873.239 --> 6879.5
I'm gonna make a pizza this afternoon

6875.94 --> 6882.839999999999
because I got like organic Pizza

6879.5 --> 6884.76
pre-baked dough or pre-baked uh pizza

6882.84 --> 6887.52
dough thing

6884.76 --> 6892.26
gonna put some

6887.52 --> 6894.540000000001
olive oil on there soak it in then

6892.26 --> 6897.06
tomato

6894.54 --> 6901.5
it's not juice tomato

6897.06 --> 6904.9800000000005
stuff you know what I mean

6901.5 --> 6907.26
the concentrate on it and then some Red

6904.98 --> 6909.598999999999
Hot Chili Peppers in little blocks and

6907.26 --> 6911.52
some zucchini

6909.599 --> 6915.06
in little blocks

6911.52 --> 6918.06
bet fresh Basils Snippets

6915.06 --> 6920.900000000001
and then some salami on there

6918.06 --> 6924.84
beef organic salami

6920.9 --> 6927.0199999999995
and finish it off with some oregano on

6924.84 --> 6927.02
there

6927.36 --> 6932.0
oh I'm looking forward to that I'm kind

6929.159 --> 6932.0
of hungry right now

6934.679 --> 6941.659
double zero flour for the base Arwin no

6939.42 --> 6941.659
no
