3.529 --> 11.19
good morning welcome to flat earth so

8.58 --> 15.599
good morning welcome to flatter the

11.19 --> 17.839
earlybird number 81 I'm your host Arwen

15.599 --> 17.839
and

18.8 --> 22.34
today is another day

30.42 --> 36.079
yeah

31.85 --> 36.079
well I got what I asked for

40.06 --> 46.83
are you happy now Arlen you happy with

43.39 --> 46.83
all all that insight

50.58 --> 56.64
anyway

53.04 --> 60.21
I'm doing okay I think

56.64 --> 60.21
but shakin

63.18 --> 69.0
as I moved up

65.84 --> 71.48
the spectrum of insight as to what was

69.0 --> 71.48
going on

71.51 --> 75.38000000000001
in a bizarre

75.74 --> 81.17999999999999
realization again it's like

78.92 --> 82.52
shifting that wavelength a little

81.18 --> 87.56
further then

82.52 --> 93.27
suddenly get to a point where I get

87.56 --> 97.07000000000001
why it all is the way it is and I get

93.27 --> 97.07
the plan again and

103.909 --> 107.14
in that sense

107.57 --> 115.49
now everything

110.009 --> 115.49
the world is is what we all asked for

116.08 --> 121.05
in a way is

118.47 --> 125.82
it's a remarkable

121.05 --> 129.72
switch in that sense and a great relief

125.82 --> 132.35999999999999
without losing sight

129.72 --> 135.76
but I was noticing that

132.36 --> 138.61
deeper I gazed in what was going on the

135.76 --> 140.45999999999998
closer I got to the people that were

138.61 --> 143.56
burdened with these

140.46 --> 145.78
these dilemmas with these choice must be

143.56 --> 148.45
even though I don't even know exactly

145.78 --> 151.44
who I'm talking about but just seeing

148.45 --> 154.26999999999998
the flow of things

151.44 --> 156.66
what is bound to happen there should be

154.27 --> 159.99
key people that are carrying that weight

156.66 --> 164.4
but man

159.99 --> 168.96
as you draw closer as I draw closer in

164.4 --> 174.99
my focus I also get all the

168.96 --> 174.99
attention from it and my god

178.68 --> 186.049
it gives me a real good sense of the

182.67 --> 190.26
effect of corruption of the burden of

186.049 --> 192.14000000000001
power which is basically choice and the

190.26 --> 195.87
more you know the more you see the

192.14 --> 199.069
heavier that choice becomes whatever

195.87 --> 199.06900000000002
it's gonna be it's

200.45 --> 209.099
ignorance is bliss guys it really is

204.23 --> 211.19
and yeah I get that everybody draws a

209.099 --> 214.79899999999998
line naturally

211.19 --> 218.79
dependent on how they're built like okay

214.799 --> 221.299
this far and no further I just can't

218.79 --> 226.489
handle it how

221.299 --> 226.489
unravel in the face of it

227.88 --> 231.95
pretty heavy stuff but

233.69 --> 241.77
again wondering with all this insight

239.03 --> 245.18
what is it I'm supposed to be figuring

241.77 --> 248.96
out with this I got my own

245.18 --> 248.96
dreams for the world

252.14 --> 258.359
and in a way I am trying trying to find

255.93 --> 261.0
like in-between solutions and like how

258.359 --> 264.5
would the darkness strike back because

261.0 --> 267.09
it always does it's like a curse

264.5 --> 270.11
it's like every time you find balance

267.09 --> 273.23999999999995
there's always something someone

270.11 --> 275.79
that just does something totally

273.24 --> 278.09000000000003
irrational out of place that ruins it

275.79 --> 282.74
all there

278.09 --> 288.38
what is so freaking

282.74 --> 288.38
it's pure Ahriman and it's like

289.949 --> 295.289
the stronger we become the stronger it

292.349 --> 298.169
becomes the more sharp it becomes the

295.289 --> 300.68
more focused it becomes in doing what it

298.169 --> 300.68
does and

300.8 --> 310.61
how can we bypass this

303.949 --> 310.61
is nonsense and then I think that many

313.069 --> 320.21000000000004
go into

316.099 --> 323.36
like magical thinking in a way

320.21 --> 326.27
and this in this sense not like legit

323.36 --> 330.22900000000004
not knowledgeable but

326.27 --> 333.349
false hope thinking in a way like maybe

330.229 --> 336.08
if we do

333.349 --> 338.15
[ __ ] then

336.08 --> 341.12899999999996
the natural

338.15 --> 343.589
uncontrollable moments will not arrive

341.129 --> 347.719
that kind of thing like we replaced the

343.589 --> 347.719
darkness but it's

349.49 --> 354.02
it doesn't really matter matter either

352.589 --> 356.25
way it's just

354.02 --> 358.87899999999996
if you're gonna do that you're gonna be

356.25 --> 358.879
lost in the process

361.21 --> 365.83
so how can you outsmart

368.5 --> 378.73
that which can outsmart anything it's

373.67 --> 378.73
like it is outsmarting the devil and I

380.05 --> 385.63
don't know I

382.63 --> 385.63
think

385.759 --> 390.43
how far does the power of Ahriman reach

389.089 --> 396.189
you know

390.43 --> 396.189
what is that that that counterbalance

399.37 --> 404.86
in a sense like I would understand the

402.82 --> 408.59999999999997
from a balanced perspective from my own

404.86 --> 411.57
perspective that yes everything is just

408.6 --> 415.51000000000005
not growing too hard not being too

411.57 --> 420.45
enthusiastic ship then yeah sure that

415.51 --> 422.8
they'll work and of course if yeah if

420.45 --> 425.05
somebody starts drowning in their own

422.8 --> 426.91
glory and starting to believe like oh my

425.05 --> 428.89
god it's so blessed everything is

426.91 --> 431.34000000000003
amazing we're going to space let's just

428.89 --> 433.08
so have million kids and

431.34 --> 436.16999999999996
going

433.08 --> 440.46999999999997
euphoric lee berserk as it were

436.17 --> 444.12
that's gonna yeah that's gonna burn the

440.47 --> 448.65000000000003
darkness again and every man will have a

444.12 --> 451.93
strike back effect no matter what

448.65 --> 456.75
so finding a balance again in that but

451.93 --> 456.75
even if everyone was balanced

456.99 --> 461.28000000000003
then what would happen then

463.06 --> 471.01
what the boredom the peace kill us would

466.93 --> 474.1
we be driven mad by no this is too much

471.01 --> 475.08
balance we want something crazy that

474.1 --> 479.20000000000005
[ __ ]

475.08 --> 482.66999999999996
the Seas here it's literally juggling

479.2 --> 486.37
with hot coals it's like no matter

482.67 --> 488.52000000000004
how you design a balance it's always

486.37 --> 492.55
something gonna arrive

488.52 --> 498.29999999999995
to unbalance it it's so crazy how it

492.55 --> 498.3
works as at least this how I'm seeing it

502.5 --> 509.79
so yeah

505.35 --> 514.51
do you get into the juggling game

509.79 --> 517.0600000000001
or do you just say oh [ __ ] it no I'm

514.51 --> 520.8
just gonna go with the overall creator

517.06 --> 523.9899999999999
and that it's supposed to be and

520.8 --> 525.66
then if you do that how much will you be

523.99 --> 529.15
tempted by

525.66 --> 532.6899999999999
the lights how drunk will you get on the

529.15 --> 534.15
light because yeah like in my opinion it

532.69 --> 537.96
corrupts to

534.15 --> 537.9599999999999
in a different way

538.58 --> 542.8100000000001
everybody that's really deep into it

540.8 --> 546.2199999999999
openly says it's yeah it's so addictive

542.81 --> 546.2199999999999
to be on the right side and

546.37 --> 552.2
but in a way it also

549.43 --> 554.829
causes destruction in another fashion

552.2 --> 559.2090000000001
its energy is energy

554.829 --> 559.209
whether it be light or dark energy

559.81 --> 566.3199999999999
anyway yeah the juggling game I guess

563.72 --> 566.32
I'm into that

566.769 --> 570.7
place thinking about it

572.26 --> 575.95
juggling with hot coals

576.709 --> 585.04
anyway let's see was in chat here

579.519 --> 590.079
guys gals did um Dan Winfield

585.04 --> 593.509
gnomes flower Steve JJ

590.079 --> 595.809
Michael or mark righteous force Jeffrey

593.509 --> 595.809
bill

596.079 --> 599.41
[ __ ] juice

599.559 --> 605.05
goober Michael

602.079 --> 606.6099999999999
bill G

605.05 --> 609.6099999999999
Aires

606.61 --> 609.61
106

611.55 --> 614.929
[Music]

617.72 --> 623.37
thank you I kind of need a lighter note

620.58 --> 625.26
for a moment guys are probably just

623.37 --> 628.34
looking away like Oh our winds be you

625.26 --> 628.34
know wizardy again

628.46 --> 637.2800000000001
which will be Wizards that kind of

632.06 --> 640.9499999999999
frolicking around on your part anyway

637.28 --> 645.65
so yeah bill G I in a way I have

640.95 --> 645.6500000000001
considered trying to make fun

646.46 --> 653.88
in their own way in D&D

650.81 --> 656.9699999999999
but yeah my players don't kind of

653.88 --> 658.65
appreciate that on the other hand the

656.97 --> 662.64
funny thing with Dungeons & Dragons is

658.65 --> 665.36
yeah it's very obvious that things are

662.64 --> 668.63
basically created and recreated and

665.36 --> 671.4300000000001
magical beasts and so it's

668.63 --> 674.64
it would be very easy to make a

671.43 --> 676.9799999999999
character that's just making a weird

674.64 --> 681.36
theory like yeah it's all from one thing

676.98 --> 683.84
and that'd be like well anyway it would

681.36 --> 686.7
even kind of be serious you could like a

683.84 --> 690.9300000000001
person that's just trying to through

686.7 --> 693.23
arcane lore which is also science in D&D

690.93 --> 697.01
it's yeah that's just

693.23 --> 701.16
Cain lord Devine more it's

697.01 --> 702.81
something else did indeed but who threw

701.16 --> 705.29
that are just trying to figure out like

702.81 --> 709.0799999999999
yeah how did it all start

705.29 --> 712.73
finding history kind of like what we're

709.08 --> 712.73
also trying to attempt and

715.34 --> 723.65
how's it all derived from one type of

719.72 --> 726.32
matter or yeah you know getting really

723.65 --> 729.98
into the nitty-gritty and even yeah

726.32 --> 733.0100000000001
thinking that oh yeah I have a theory

729.98 --> 735.9200000000001
yeah I finite all these creatures I find

733.01 --> 738.65
all these ancient things and this is how

735.92 --> 743.54
they must have evolved like I already

738.65 --> 748.18
kind of worked this in to what what the

743.54 --> 752.0889999999999
players just come across like ancient

748.18 --> 755.779
wall carvings or constructions like idly

752.089 --> 759.7900000000001
yeah throw ancient ruins in that game a

755.779 --> 759.79
lot because it is just so awesome

760.39 --> 765.529
and I can just give them hints of

762.83 --> 767.45
something and then that hints starting

765.529 --> 769.779
in my mind pretty primitive can turn out

767.45 --> 772.6400000000001
to be pretty vast a

769.779 --> 774.8
part of a vaster thing that was in the

772.64 --> 777.77
ancient past and then I fabricate as

774.8 --> 780.77
they move along more elements of this

777.77 --> 782.8
until they might have an opportunity to

780.77 --> 788.92
actually

782.8 --> 791.8389999999999
get into that factor as a separate yeah

788.92 --> 794.0
archeology adventure or whatever finding

791.839 --> 796.7900000000001
some time this realm where these beings

794.0 --> 801.85
are still that kind of you know that's

796.79 --> 801.8499999999999
the amazing power of D&D

803.53 --> 812.17
you create the world as you go you

807.7 --> 812.1700000000001
deepen the detail as you go

815.029 --> 819.29
anyway yeah I love doing that

819.83 --> 825.32
and I love trying to experiment with

823.92 --> 828.15
reflecting

825.32 --> 831.45
the things that we learn in this world

828.15 --> 834.41
in the game and for my player it players

831.45 --> 836.21
it's a it's a glory as well because I

834.41 --> 839.76
can make

836.21 --> 843.6500000000001
the game more real in a way that they

839.76 --> 847.17
don't understand because they're glowers

843.65 --> 849.09
but they will feel the real and that's

847.17 --> 851.36
almost kind of the trick as what the

849.09 --> 854.09
Hollywood sometimes does it's like

851.36 --> 857.99
hiding real [ __ ]

854.09 --> 860.45
called symbolism or real [ __ ]

857.99 --> 863.97
in

860.45 --> 865.86
in their works and we see the predictive

863.97 --> 867.21
programming in a certain region but

865.86 --> 870.09
there's other things that might just

867.21 --> 872.1600000000001
slip our attention because we're not

870.09 --> 875.45
really focused in those directions of

872.16 --> 877.01
thinking and

875.45 --> 880.1400000000001
that's

877.01 --> 883.4
the power of story building basically

880.14 --> 883.4
it's amazing

884.96 --> 890.089
oh my god bill gee that is just

887.33 --> 893.12
impossible to tell what's my favorite

890.089 --> 895.85
day in the class look I like playing a

893.12 --> 898.16
barbarian okay this was my first

895.85 --> 901.36
character it's kind of obvious that I

898.16 --> 904.7199999999999
have these needs in me

901.36 --> 907.69
and just be

904.72 --> 911.32
simple and

907.69 --> 915.11
impulsive and we were strong and like

911.32 --> 918.0200000000001
protective and like a good barbarian oh

915.11 --> 920.5
my god so such a joy to play a character

918.02 --> 923.8389999999999
like that but I

920.5 --> 926.72
also of course yeah seven seas to like

923.839 --> 929.0500000000001
go throw for the elfin kind and

926.72 --> 931.149
magicians or maybe like

929.05 --> 935.3199999999999
arcane archers

931.149 --> 937.92
like magic powers with bows well

935.32 --> 942.36
all right

937.92 --> 946.18
that's something else and

942.36 --> 950.32
look every class has its amazing aspects

946.18 --> 954.0999999999999
I like the druid a lot for obvious

950.32 --> 956.8290000000001
reasons nature power nature and plans

954.1 --> 959.61
and talking with plants and just of that

956.829 --> 963.55
stuff you know and

959.61 --> 967.3000000000001
I use that too that those cultures from

963.55 --> 968.399
springing forth from the Elvin race in

967.3 --> 971.769
my world

968.399 --> 975.399
obviously but also yeah everywhere

971.769 --> 979.259
pretty much as a minor the aspect some

975.399 --> 983.319
will just be druids but I like Jared's

979.259 --> 987.1
nature stuff and the neutrality the

983.319 --> 991.68
balance thing that's very critical into

987.1 --> 991.6800000000001
it culture in D&D at least and

996.92 --> 999.0699999999999
and

1000.38 --> 1004.93
I don't know anything can really be cool

1003.02 --> 1007.91
at least for a while

1004.93 --> 1009.91
like and I try to make all the classes

1007.91 --> 1013.51
to be really awesome

1009.91 --> 1015.88
like the fighters to are like

1013.51 --> 1020.45
just very

1015.88 --> 1022.55
combat capable special move [ __ ] kind of

1020.45 --> 1024.6100000000001
thing and it's awesome to do that as

1022.55 --> 1028.22
well

1024.61 --> 1030.5
contrast to the barbarian and yeah look

1028.22 --> 1032.95
even rogues like sneaking around his

1030.5 --> 1035.78
[ __ ] like a row can be awesome

1032.95 --> 1039.5
especially because they leave so much

1035.78 --> 1043.0
room for a character with the bluffing

1039.5 --> 1047.63
that they will probably have as a skill

1043.0 --> 1050.54
it just makes fascinating loci like

1047.63 --> 1054.14
characters so yeah I have a couple of

1050.54 --> 1056.54
ropes that I play as NPCs alongside the

1054.14 --> 1059.42
players just as extras to give an extra

1056.54 --> 1061.94
influence tell separate stories give

1059.42 --> 1063.8700000000001
more quests and yeah I got rogues and

1061.94 --> 1066.539
it's like

1063.87 --> 1068.58
they very quickly become the favorite

1066.539 --> 1071.34
character of everyone because they're

1068.58 --> 1074.309
like yeah I got this rope dwarf guy

1071.34 --> 1076.9089999999999
that's like really ugly and he's called

1074.309 --> 1080.22
bald Drake and

1076.909 --> 1083.64
yeah he is definitely inspired on ball

1080.22 --> 1086.4
Drake and he's just very annoying but

1083.64 --> 1089.3300000000002
he's really loyal and really good at

1086.4 --> 1089.3300000000002
what he can do just

1089.72 --> 1096.72
it's just a great part for the story

1092.57 --> 1100.07
it's amusing gives it a comedy aspect to

1096.72 --> 1103.07
like with rogues comes comedy

1100.07 --> 1103.07
yeah

1108.17 --> 1113.17
and then there's all the other branches

1110.21 --> 1116.48
like a paladin

1113.17 --> 1118.94
paladin's can be Oh m'god a penalty new

1116.48 --> 1121.22
or people can be all whiny especially

1118.94 --> 1123.89
liberals of course which are probably

1121.22 --> 1126.29
the predominant group of people playing

1123.89 --> 1130.3400000000001
this game they will be whining about

1126.29 --> 1131.77
paladins a lot because it's not really

1130.34 --> 1135.5
in tune

1131.77 --> 1137.45
with them in a way it's just a burden

1135.5 --> 1139.67
but I would love it because yeah

1137.45 --> 1142.73
paladin's really deal with the high

1139.67 --> 1147.23
moral dilemmas and personal sacrifice

1142.73 --> 1151.48
and stuffing and that is also very cool

1147.23 --> 1154.07
in a way I can appreciate that and

1151.48 --> 1155.84
then on the other side yeah what guess

1154.07 --> 1157.46
what's gonna happen if I would like to

1155.84 --> 1159.26
make a pet and I consider this like

1157.46 --> 1161.48
putting a pallet in the party well

1159.26 --> 1163.07
that's like even a gamer's thing like oh

1161.48 --> 1166.1
my god you're gonna put a pallet in it

1163.07 --> 1168.6799999999998
as an NPC in a party all right to keep

1166.1 --> 1171.11
everyone in line or if I'm gonna do that

1168.68 --> 1174.8600000000001
I wouldn't even do it to keep them in

1171.11 --> 1177.9199999999998
line they would be naturally having to

1174.86 --> 1180.5
do that but they would then of course

1177.92 --> 1183.5600000000002
make fun of the Paladin and screw around

1180.5 --> 1186.95
with him because that's what all the

1183.56 --> 1189.08
indie campers do with paladins unless

1186.95 --> 1191.3300000000002
it's one of their players and then they

1189.08 --> 1194.32
feel like oh [ __ ] he's really trying to

1191.33 --> 1194.32
accomplish something in

1194.48 --> 1199.3700000000001
yeah but so paladin's are awesome but

1197.72 --> 1201.32
it's really difficult to work with

1199.37 --> 1204.1399999999999
you've got to get all your players in

1201.32 --> 1207.05
line two to go with that to take that

1204.14 --> 1209.66
kind of seriously or it's gonna be just

1207.05 --> 1212.84
silly around making fun of the Paladin

1209.66 --> 1215.1100000000001
and my god it can be so funny to do that

1212.84 --> 1220.01
there's this

1215.11 --> 1222.1899999999998
the gamers movie yeah that's like very

1220.01 --> 1225.02
much D&D and

1222.19 --> 1227.3300000000002
it's about a gamer group playing in D

1225.02 --> 1229.25
and then you see them in character doing

1227.33 --> 1232.1
their stuff and it's mostly goofing

1229.25 --> 1233.87
around and typical D&D ship and yeah

1232.1 --> 1235.76
they got a they did exactly that they

1233.87 --> 1239.9899999999998
put a paladin in there and oh my god

1235.76 --> 1241.25
it's so freaking hilarious and wrong how

1239.99 --> 1242.11
do they deal with it and that's so

1241.25 --> 1245.9
typical

1242.11 --> 1247.87
but that's a pretty superficial stance

1245.9 --> 1249.8600000000001
it's what a lot of people are probably

1247.87 --> 1252.53
automatically going to bump into that

1249.86 --> 1255.56
are just surface playing the game not

1252.53 --> 1257.74
taking it very deeply that's not really

1255.56 --> 1257.74
my thing

1258.07 --> 1263.83
and what else is cool yeah you got me

1261.71 --> 1265.6000000000001
talking about DMV now

1263.83 --> 1269.8899999999999
so

1265.6 --> 1269.8899999999999
it is kind of a relief though

1277.77 --> 1281.77
yeah

1279.32 --> 1284.4199999999998
and I

1281.77 --> 1287.09
don't know all the character types I

1284.42 --> 1289.22
only design something if they could be

1287.09 --> 1292.22
interesting in a way so everything I

1289.22 --> 1297.46
designed all the prestige classes and

1292.22 --> 1297.46
some really dark stuff in there to like

1298.24 --> 1306.65
black cards how bizarre is that those

1302.78 --> 1308.53
maniacally surrendering to evil to the

1306.65 --> 1312.47
spirit of evil kind of thing that's

1308.53 --> 1314.87
messed up it's there and at least yeah

1312.47 --> 1317.72
if players are not gonna do that then

1314.87 --> 1320.7199999999998
it's very useful as a game master to use

1317.72 --> 1324.13
them as opponents because they're very

1320.72 --> 1328.76
easy to hate they are like

1324.13 --> 1332.42
the emperor types and they don't always

1328.76 --> 1336.17
necessarily have to be a super smart but

1332.42 --> 1340.04
they will just be nasty types very easy

1336.17 --> 1341.23
feeling yeah you won't be sorry to see

1340.04 --> 1343.52
him go

1341.23 --> 1347.1100000000001
because if you make really really

1343.52 --> 1350.29
awesome opponents that

1347.11 --> 1354.35
then yeah

1350.29 --> 1355.45
either and have end up corrupting your

1354.35 --> 1358.49
party

1355.45 --> 1360.41
that's really can happen that's freaky

1358.49 --> 1362.36
it's just you don't know what the

1360.41 --> 1364.94
players are gonna do and if they even

1362.36 --> 1366.7099999999998
get what's going on so they either then

1364.94 --> 1368.9
if you make it to cool villain they'll

1366.71 --> 1371.32
either corrupt or they will try to find

1368.9 --> 1375.3100000000002
some kind of peace deal

1371.32 --> 1377.01
it's so typical it's not movie hero

1375.31 --> 1379.96
stuff at all

1377.01 --> 1382.65
it's much more pragmatic anyway and it

1379.96 --> 1385.65
is fascinating to behold what they do

1382.65 --> 1385.65
and

1386.13 --> 1390.46
I'm also trying to figure out yeah how

1388.72 --> 1393.16
would things respond to that because

1390.46 --> 1396.19
everything makes it change it always

1393.16 --> 1398.2
does in real world so also in the gaming

1396.19 --> 1400.3600000000001
world has to if there's no real

1398.2 --> 1403.6000000000001
consequences for extreme actions then

1400.36 --> 1405.81
reality doesn't make sense so there has

1403.6 --> 1408.4199999999998
to be a counter response and

1405.81 --> 1411.19
I'm just thinking like

1408.42 --> 1414.21
they've already pretty much made a peace

1411.19 --> 1416.71
deal with the evil group without

1414.21 --> 1419.38
actually tapping into the darkness they

1416.71 --> 1423.54
managed to prevent that to not do

1419.38 --> 1423.5400000000002
something totally corrupt and

1426.73 --> 1432.879
what's gonna happen now with ya those

1430.299 --> 1434.98
giants that they deal they'll go evil

1432.879 --> 1438.73
Giants they were not like for all the

1434.98 --> 1440.279
key people the ice giants are just big

1438.73 --> 1443.44
and

1440.279 --> 1446.2
evil and I emphasize that even in the

1443.44 --> 1449.46
culture like yeah they are like use

1446.2 --> 1452.559
their icy goddess to basically

1449.46 --> 1453.97
mind-control everyone and it's natural

1452.559 --> 1455.34
that's how they always done it so they

1453.97 --> 1459.309
have like

1455.34 --> 1461.259
and wholly spared dark spirit collective

1459.309 --> 1463.239
in them and that makes them like pretty

1461.259 --> 1466.33
creepy but they are very they're still a

1463.239 --> 1469.6000000000001
lawful nature so they will follow orders

1466.33 --> 1472.779
no matter our grief or the darkness they

1469.6 --> 1474.399
get and [ __ ] and and they manage to work

1472.779 --> 1477.19
around it they could have probably

1474.399 --> 1481.4499999999998
destroyed the entire thing over time but

1477.19 --> 1484.21
yeah then my god that yeah it's a

1481.45 --> 1485.95
freaking Empire of giants basically and

1484.21 --> 1488.6190000000001
it's in the middle of nowhere so it's

1485.95 --> 1491.529
not gonna touch their civilization but

1488.619 --> 1497.639
it was basically in the way for their

1491.529 --> 1497.639
travel where they needed to go it's the

1497.77 --> 1502.08
yeah

1500.07 --> 1503.789
and their actions did yeah they're

1502.08 --> 1506.239
actually did have consequences in a

1503.789 --> 1509.1
sense because

1506.239 --> 1510.259
they basically broke a certain and

1509.1 --> 1512.789
chompin

1510.259 --> 1515.1
that was very dark that was keeping

1512.789 --> 1517.7
everything in peace in the peace

1515.1 --> 1521.09
situation because they did that

1517.7 --> 1524.82
yeah war broke out in with the locals

1521.09 --> 1526.309
these snow elves which is like very

1524.82 --> 1529.249
passive

1526.309 --> 1532.099
very smart the hiding

1529.249 --> 1534.33
cultural type of group a

1532.099 --> 1536.46
different type of elves it's just like

1534.33 --> 1539.58
this is the snow world like I think

1536.46 --> 1541.6490000000001
Mario world like this is the snow world

1539.58 --> 1544.4089999999999
so everything can be there but it's

1541.649 --> 1545.9699999999998
gonna be icy or snow seemed in one way

1544.409 --> 1548.19
or the other and everything all the

1545.97 --> 1551.21
dragons they're gonna suddenly be ice

1548.19 --> 1556.3990000000001
dragons and it's

1551.21 --> 1556.3990000000001
so icy lands frost line

1558.68 --> 1564.74
but yeah those peoples are and the

1562.67 --> 1568.6000000000001
Giants are basically attacking the snow

1564.74 --> 1571.55
elves and snow elves are trying to now

1568.6 --> 1574.79
after very long trying to get out of

1571.55 --> 1577.43
their peace mode and somehow get

1574.79 --> 1579.2
stronger and being able to defend

1577.43 --> 1581.18
themselves but yeah they're not really

1579.2 --> 1582.73
succeeding at first because the frost

1581.18 --> 1586.64
giants are just

1582.73 --> 1589.55
enormous and merciless and they're just

1586.64 --> 1592.46
like taking them down as a as a revenge

1589.55 --> 1596.48
action for all the disruption the

1592.46 --> 1599.95
attention is basically caused yeah and

1596.48 --> 1599.95
they're trying to live with that

1601.66 --> 1607.4
it's funny how I kind of give them like

1604.73 --> 1611.1100000000001
this burden of I do emphasize it to them

1607.4 --> 1614.1100000000001
like yeah you did this remember that

1611.11 --> 1614.11
and

1615.86 --> 1620.8899999999999
yeah then you come in with their deities

1623.39 --> 1628.169
and that's just weird because they're

1626.01 --> 1631.41
all so chaotic all over the place and

1628.169 --> 1634.22
there is be the cleric of the party

1631.41 --> 1634.22
which is a dwarf

1640.25 --> 1649.32
and yet it her God is

1645.11 --> 1652.04
unsafe and unsafe is a party car god of

1649.32 --> 1654.99
party and war so

1652.04 --> 1658.29
yeah that can get pretty messy and

1654.99 --> 1660.51
that's probably the reason as to how

1658.29 --> 1663.3899999999999
things progress because yeah that God is

1660.51 --> 1667.22
very happy because yeah they are

1663.39 --> 1671.6100000000001
building a lot of parties and

1667.22 --> 1674.8700000000001
basically creating Wars and but they're

1671.61 --> 1677.6689999999999
doing it for a good reason like

1674.87 --> 1680.2199999999998
the god of that dwarf is for the reason

1677.669 --> 1683.669
to her like yeah these people are

1680.22 --> 1686.58
through vision through commune can

1683.669 --> 1690.5
happen in in this game like yeah these

1686.58 --> 1692.3
people are weak from peace and

1690.5 --> 1694.16
yeah they're they're becoming weenies

1692.3 --> 1697.6699999999998
they're becoming so a boy on your own

1694.16 --> 1700.8500000000001
still not as bad as sorry boys out there

1697.67 --> 1704.21
but like they need a challenge they need

1700.85 --> 1707.51
to get out of this peach situation we'll

1704.21 --> 1709.21
go to war and so that's why she chose to

1707.51 --> 1714.85
do that

1709.21 --> 1714.8500000000001
to force a break in the peace

1715.9 --> 1721.21
and yeah

1718.27 --> 1722.67
it's a good way for me as a game master

1721.21 --> 1725.6100000000001
did

1722.67 --> 1730.3500000000001
to deal with

1725.61 --> 1730.35
all of this typical [ __ ] in the world

1732.26 --> 1739.86
just build something that is very real

1735.6 --> 1743.34
so I can learn from it and find all the

1739.86 --> 1746.06
essences that are released with that

1743.34 --> 1748.8899999999999
virtual situation in this case

1746.06 --> 1751.1
just see like how does this make sense

1748.89 --> 1753.75
how is the perspective of this

1751.1 --> 1755.7199999999998
individual or this group there and I was

1753.75 --> 1758.82
the others got to be and

1755.72 --> 1760.43
yeah I take this game really freaking

1758.82 --> 1764.27
seriously

1760.43 --> 1764.27
only because I can

1764.6 --> 1772.6699999999998
it does make me a bent better world

1768.96 --> 1772.67
painter for the game

1781.75 --> 1786.06
all right so let's see what are you guys

1783.43 --> 1786.0600000000002
are talking about

1797.84 --> 1803.7099999999998
killing the International Monetary Fund

1800.53 --> 1803.71
all right

1814.57 --> 1820.51
yeah sorry about the his it's I

1818.1 --> 1822.9699999999998
don't want to complain about it even

1820.51 --> 1826.09
don't hang it up it's just it's it'll

1822.97 --> 1830.28
stop promise at some point that hissing

1826.09 --> 1830.28
is gonna stop it's gonna be clear

1835.54 --> 1842.539
I found yep look

1838.74 --> 1844.57
from one perspective right

1842.539 --> 1849.18
but

1844.57 --> 1852.61
for me personally to be sure with with

1849.18 --> 1856.3200000000002
but I have I really have to know the

1852.61 --> 1860.59
full thing of everything you're doing

1856.32 --> 1863.3799999999999
because they might also be the last

1860.59 --> 1865.83
defense for some really critical things

1863.38 --> 1868.38
as well so

1865.83 --> 1871.33
you have to know

1868.38 --> 1874.0900000000001
the full scale what will happen if you

1871.33 --> 1876.8799999999999
do actually take something down is there

1874.09 --> 1879.58
another way is there some other way

1876.88 --> 1881.88
again me always trying to do this [ __ ]

1879.58 --> 1881.8799999999999
you know

1882.21 --> 1887.89
you have to know the full picture before

1885.13 --> 1890.6200000000001
you can just say take it all done and in

1887.89 --> 1892.6200000000001
retrospect I even have to say that in a

1890.62 --> 1895.33
way about the Rothschilds

1892.62 --> 1898.4989999999998
for

1895.33 --> 1901.98
for everything all the [ __ ] that

1898.499 --> 1907.6290000000001
surrounds that yeah absolutely

1901.98 --> 1911.009
darkness must be met but also know what

1907.629 --> 1913.259
are they doing that is kind of good and

1911.009 --> 1917.619
how can you

1913.259 --> 1921.519
reinforce that part so that that doesn't

1917.619 --> 1925.6789999999999
get destroyed and learn learn the

1921.519 --> 1929.22
consequences of all these things

1925.679 --> 1933.659
you know and realize that

1929.22 --> 1936.029
big power with big power comes big

1933.659 --> 1939.0390000000002
organizations and

1936.029 --> 1941.23
there's individuals in every one of

1939.039 --> 1943.23
those organizations and they all have

1941.23 --> 1945.97
their level of knowledge

1943.23 --> 1948.779
their dream as to what they're trying to

1945.97 --> 1950.999
maintain for themselves and

1948.779 --> 1954.159
their needs

1950.999 --> 1958.6490000000001
natural need for things to be better in

1954.159 --> 1958.6490000000001
the world as well so how

1958.799 --> 1963.9089999999999
isn't a

1961.049 --> 1965.22
transformation much better than just

1963.909 --> 1968.0700000000002
boom

1965.22 --> 1971.07
taking yeah see

1968.07 --> 1971.07
ya

1972.09 --> 1976.6399999999999
I hope you can do something with that

1977.69 --> 1980.8700000000001
but it's

1984.97 --> 1989.23
so but even then you know even if you

1988.37 --> 1992.6599999999999
don't

1989.23 --> 1996.6200000000001
even if you do even if you don't it's

1992.66 --> 1999.3700000000001
gonna be burdens no matter what there's

1996.62 --> 2001.7399999999998
never a

1999.37 --> 2004.09
perfect

2001.74 --> 2008.43
we

2004.09 --> 2011.36
a perfect win for everyone doesn't exist

2008.43 --> 2011.3600000000001
not entirely

2012.63 --> 2018.5600000000002
but you gotta get as close as you could

2015.78 --> 2018.56
possibly get

2022.65 --> 2026.6000000000001
and it really all eventually does come

2025.32 --> 2031.22
down to personal

2026.6 --> 2035.6599999999999
responsibility for your own

2031.22 --> 2035.66
feelings and your own ego

2036.83 --> 2042.59
again back to the question that I asked

2040.41 --> 2042.5900000000001
yesterday

2045.05 --> 2051.95
or another question or remark like I

2047.88 --> 2056.4900000000002
hope we're all able

2051.95 --> 2060.2
to overcome what is necessary like the

2056.49 --> 2064.7
necessary lost and it is always

2060.2 --> 2064.7
unacceptable that kind of [ __ ] but

2066.57 --> 2072.81
maybe

2068.3 --> 2077.84
again a partial loss into in not so much

2072.81 --> 2082.73
loss and actually a reinforcement

2077.84 --> 2082.73
for more so most

2088.59 --> 2096.8
must learn to tame the darkness on every

2092.79 --> 2099.71
scale basically tamed the darkness

2096.8 --> 2103.4
don't surrender to it

2099.71 --> 2105.26
don't try to deny it exists

2103.4 --> 2110.34
and

2105.26 --> 2113.25
like the ego keep it under control it is

2110.34 --> 2114.8
the ego in a way is a manifestation of

2113.25 --> 2119.97
the darkness

2114.8 --> 2122.9300000000003
it is also viable to it it can push

2119.97 --> 2126.24
through the ego to

2122.93 --> 2128.75
obsess over things that will turn to

2126.24 --> 2128.75
destruction

2133.52 --> 2141.68
yeah but you can't remove it

2136.99 --> 2145.1499999999996
see you can pretend it's not there it's

2141.68 --> 2145.1499999999996
the same thing see

2152.29 --> 2156.609
Wow crowd a jet here

2177.05 --> 2181.42
[Music]

2178.57 --> 2182.2200000000003
I have no idea what you guys are talking

2181.42 --> 2185.2200000000003
about

2182.22 --> 2185.22
anyway

2185.94 --> 2192.36
yeah I don't be hit that's God

2190.53 --> 2195.36
thanks for that

2192.36 --> 2195.36
anyway

2199.18 --> 2201.8399999999997
right

2205.14 --> 2210.39
yes over mocha there needs to be a

2207.369 --> 2216.06
balance between everything

2210.39 --> 2219.8689999999997
on all levels in a way in

2216.06 --> 2222.869
insight and ignorance

2219.869 --> 2222.869
love

2224.73 --> 2227.73
and

2228.869 --> 2235.23
indulgence all these things every side

2232.869 --> 2235.23
always

2238.51 --> 2244.48
it's like again juggling hot coals but

2241.7 --> 2248.6299999999997
on a much smaller scale

2244.48 --> 2251.0
and look we can all be doing it and

2248.63 --> 2252.52
become masters at it and who knows where

2251.0 --> 2254.53
to leave

2252.52 --> 2259.75
you know I

2254.53 --> 2259.75
think personally it could be magnificent

2262.79 --> 2265.87
and in a way

2271.51 --> 2280.1800000000003
all things will in one way or the other

2275.55 --> 2284.1600000000003
transform so either dies or it

2280.18 --> 2287.3199999999997
transforms but it doesn't mean that

2284.16 --> 2289.6
it everything can just automatically

2287.32 --> 2291.119
change without any influence or energy

2289.6 --> 2294.1189999999997
or help from others

2291.119 --> 2294.119
so

2294.15 --> 2299.7200000000003
and how do we all transform in a

2297.029 --> 2303.95
direction in a way

2299.72 --> 2307.7889999999998
that destroys the least things

2303.95 --> 2311.269
if something is in the way how can you

2307.789 --> 2314.3900000000003
help it overcome

2311.269 --> 2318.4399999999996
being in your way

2314.39 --> 2318.44
how can you make that doable

2325.369 --> 2328.15
anyway

2330.51 --> 2333.17
yeah

2335.34 --> 2337.76
and

2348.26 --> 2353.4
yeah

2349.839 --> 2353.4
and everyone you know

2354.029 --> 2361.289
resisting theirs resisting death and

2356.949 --> 2361.289
theirs resisting glory so

2361.38 --> 2367.7090000000003
if a

2364.109 --> 2372.18
champion of light would like

2367.709 --> 2372.18
this is really weird stuff but

2375.34 --> 2379.32
ah dammit I don't know

2380.34 --> 2385.26
discontinued not going there

2398.319 --> 2406.569
yeah just to do get some stuff again I

2403.049 --> 2409.859
am kind of worried again about the

2406.569 --> 2412.749
freaking Amazon rainforest because I

2409.859 --> 2414.269
had confirmation about worries about it

2412.749 --> 2417.1299999999997
and

2414.269 --> 2419.6789999999996
of course there's Brazil now and

2417.13 --> 2422.559
Venezuela and I didn't even realise that

2419.679 --> 2427.179
but yeah that's exactly another swath of

2422.559 --> 2429.009
it so is this there more countries like

2427.179 --> 2429.809
this surrounding that place that are

2429.009 --> 2434.049
gonna

2429.809 --> 2440.0690000000004
certainly have an friction or something

2434.049 --> 2443.109
new like gathering monsters to move

2440.069 --> 2447.479
to basically destroy it because that's

2443.109 --> 2451.359
what how it feels like for me and I

2447.479 --> 2453.0589999999997
get and I am even hearing it secretly

2451.359 --> 2456.089
but

2453.059 --> 2459.309
Venezuela has so many resources

2456.089 --> 2461.679
right right okay but are those resources

2459.309 --> 2464.3390000000004
like right underneath the Amazon or

2461.679 --> 2464.339
something and

2464.429 --> 2469.949
so what is the plan you know if they're

2468.339 --> 2474.219
gonna do this

2469.949 --> 2477.489
how how are they gonna prevent the death

2474.219 --> 2479.619
of that entire region and I think it

2477.489 --> 2481.859
probably could be done even and this is

2479.619 --> 2485.2290000000003
again me

2481.859 --> 2491.009
trying to find that middle way like look

2485.229 --> 2494.6789999999996
at the modern industry and really modern

2491.009 --> 2497.94
mining industry the the most high-tech

2494.679 --> 2500.849
stuff it could

2497.94 --> 2505.27
potentially

2500.849 --> 2505.9500000000003
have industries in there without as much

2505.27 --> 2510.869
as

2505.95 --> 2513.58
one single particle of poison

2510.869 --> 2516.82
coming off them and I'm not talking

2513.58 --> 2521.49
about co2 because yeah bring it on do

2516.82 --> 2525.369
for us actually gonna enjoy that so

2521.49 --> 2528.1899999999996
you know again turn it in the potential

2525.369 --> 2530.53
survival oh and win this is my thing

2528.19 --> 2531.48
yeah I get it resource oh we want the

2530.53 --> 2533.34
resource

2531.48 --> 2539.04
but

2533.34 --> 2539.04
don't kill [ __ ] for it's not necessary

2541.23 --> 2544.23
right

2545.04 --> 2551.859
so obvious

2548.56 --> 2553.84
I'll by the way only sheep cans can't

2551.859 --> 2559.109
see thank you for the super chat

2553.84 --> 2559.109
donations of what is that MZ

2561.78 --> 2566.1200000000003
anyway $10 of some kind

2566.6 --> 2571.25
thanks for that appreciate it

2576.03 --> 2582.9900000000002
yeah I feel good hard even though either

2578.349 --> 2582.9900000000002
you think you're at this flick yeah

2587.79 --> 2596.16
so yeah that is my proposition and I can

2591.46 --> 2598.23
out I could feel last night the bunch of

2596.16 --> 2600.39
freaking

2598.23 --> 2603.4
industrialists I

2600.39 --> 2606.19
don't want to use my profit I don't want

2603.4 --> 2611.4300000000003
the expensive and I'm like are you

2606.19 --> 2614.64
seriously gonna let your ego your hunger

2611.43 --> 2617.3689999999997
freaking destroy it all

2614.64 --> 2619.89
are you seriously gonna do that

2617.369 --> 2622.7400000000002
so no

2619.89 --> 2626.3689999999997
somehow

2622.74 --> 2629.6499999999996
think it might be doable but

2626.369 --> 2632.619
must be kept in check because it's a

2629.65 --> 2634.2200000000003
dangerous situation no matter what it's

2632.619 --> 2637.26
a very risky

2634.22 --> 2637.2599999999998
[Music]

2637.39 --> 2643.75
and look I've even seen weirder things

2640.84 --> 2646.02
like what would happen if it would go

2643.75 --> 2646.02
wrong

2649.38 --> 2657.96
remember about

2652.83 --> 2661.27
Brazil that aliens were so popular

2657.96 --> 2663.51
right in the media brought it up so many

2661.27 --> 2665.28
times it's almost like a folklore thing

2663.51 --> 2667.1400000000003
well

2665.28 --> 2669.3100000000004
think

2667.14 --> 2672.91
if they're just actually gonna

2669.31 --> 2676.2999999999997
completely destroy that [ __ ] I think

2672.91 --> 2678.8799999999997
there's gonna be some really weird alien

2676.3 --> 2680.25
[ __ ] going on if that happens after that

2678.88 --> 2683.25
point

2680.25 --> 2683.25
so

2684.2 --> 2691.46
it's like this always you think oh yeah

2687.109 --> 2694.64
yeah yeah sure it's doable we don't we

2691.46 --> 2696.98
can just drown in our eternal ego self

2694.64 --> 2698.92
worshiping glory and how great we are

2696.98 --> 2702.349
that

2698.92 --> 2704.63
look everybody's happy again except that

2702.349 --> 2708.44
thing being completely destroyed because

2704.63 --> 2710.7200000000003
we are we can afford to do it the better

2708.44 --> 2713.619
way we have to do it the cheap way that

2710.72 --> 2718.0589999999997
kind of [ __ ] okay it will have his dire

2713.619 --> 2718.059
consequences I think this case

2718.54 --> 2723.3
yeah

2721.06 --> 2727.62
I don't know I

2723.3 --> 2727.6200000000003
got a weird feeling about this one

2743.73 --> 2748.52
yeah wouldn't

2745.579 --> 2751.7400000000002
wouldn't the globus just loved it

2748.52 --> 2753.5
there's some serious weird alien type

2751.74 --> 2756.5499999999997
creatures suddenly start

2753.5 --> 2758.39
messing around

2756.55 --> 2761.1600000000003
[Music]

2758.39 --> 2764.609
and all the guy up people would all be

2761.16 --> 2767.42
gushing oh my god it's the alien saviors

2764.609 --> 2770.819
and oh that [ __ ]

2767.42 --> 2773.64
so we fletchers this would be like what

2770.819 --> 2776.5099999999998
the [ __ ] right how did they come from

2773.64 --> 2779.8799999999997
what is this

2776.51 --> 2782.76
this must be some weird freaky extra

2779.88 --> 2786.53
dimensional [ __ ] and it probably will be

2782.76 --> 2786.53
if that's gonna happen

2789.77 --> 2794.42
what am i doing

2792.26 --> 2800.36
I'm just

2794.42 --> 2800.36
saying what might happen

2808.39 --> 2811.92
are you guys talking about

2827.609 --> 2831.14
right

2828.799 --> 2837.709
yes Steve

2831.14 --> 2837.709
no forests no air that's right so ya

2839.029 --> 2846.289
must work away

2841.64 --> 2849.5389999999998
to figure out how to just not

2846.289 --> 2850.94
yeah not turn everything into freaking

2849.539 --> 2854.69
cities and

2850.94 --> 2857.719
polluted industry ground and [ __ ]

2854.69 --> 2859.279
stuff this is

2857.719 --> 2863.009
insane

2859.279 --> 2866.94
sacrifice of nature for no damn reasons

2863.009 --> 2869.42
no good reasons only short-term insane

2866.94 --> 2869.42
reasons

2870.2 --> 2875.479
and

2871.88 --> 2879.69
yeah we look

2875.479 --> 2883.499
forests can be made again so what is

2879.69 --> 2885.41
everyone waiting for and yeah if

2883.499 --> 2889.1299999999997
somebody's stopping it why

2885.41 --> 2894.509
who's stopping that and

2889.13 --> 2899.3
why what is that who would stop no

2894.509 --> 2902.63
forests from being made and why

2899.3 --> 2904.6000000000004
it needs to be some serious looking into

2902.63 --> 2906.9700000000003
that

2904.6 --> 2910.13
like

2906.97 --> 2912.83
Hagrid Wells told me like you would be

2910.13 --> 2916.67
planting trees or trying to in arnhem

2912.83 --> 2919.84
and that they would forbid it very very

2916.67 --> 2924.01
strictly and that just

2919.84 --> 2924.01
doesn't make any damn sense

2925.31 --> 2931.34
yeah Steve plants and discovered I know

2928.9 --> 2933.89
and there will always be more to

2931.34 --> 2936.6200000000003
discover and there will always be things

2933.89 --> 2939.17
like oh [ __ ] we destroyed it we just

2936.62 --> 2940.85
figured out something new we found what

2939.17 --> 2942.71
we accidentally destroyed it's probably

2940.85 --> 2946.49
gonna keep on happening for all eternity

2942.71 --> 2948.9700000000003
but look on the other hand is there a

2946.49 --> 2951.52
limited amount of plant species even

2948.97 --> 2956.29
what's Chris berry

2951.52 --> 2956.29
