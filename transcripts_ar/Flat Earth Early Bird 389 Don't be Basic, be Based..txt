41.77 --> 43.800000000000004
ooh

44.27 --> 50.03
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

46.73 --> 51.949999999999996
number 389 i'm your host

50.03 --> 54.08
Arwen and before I start to show please

51.95 --> 55.97
don't forget to share it like secret

54.08 --> 58.4
Asian man thanks for sharing on D live

55.97 --> 61.1
and everyone looking on the life through

58.4 --> 61.699999999999996
secret Asian man's channel welcome to

61.1 --> 65.059
the Flat Earth

61.7 --> 69.89
early bird show I may eventually use my

65.059 --> 72.92
own channel to stream on D life but yeah

69.89 --> 74.75
thanks for sharing so and if you haven't

72.92 --> 76.34
already subscribe to my channel and hit

74.75 --> 77.9
the bell notification so you know when

76.34 --> 80.60000000000001
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

77.9 --> 82.67
p.m. Amsterdam time every day and please

80.6 --> 84.649
also do support me through the Pay Pal

82.67 --> 87.649
patreon my GoFundMe and the super chat

84.649 --> 91.58
or can be found in the description box

87.649 --> 95.08
my youtube channel yeah any support

91.58 --> 102.35
would be much appreciated so today

95.08 --> 107.11
weather is me little bit of rain here

102.35 --> 107.11
and there but not too bad it's cold

109.41 --> 112.41
seems

112.49 --> 119.03
yeah it's a bit windy also but maybe

115.34 --> 124.07000000000001
because air seems somewhat thick little

119.03 --> 130.3
wind feels like a lot of wind so yeah

124.07 --> 138.29
welcome I have with me today green tea

130.3 --> 142.82000000000002
and leftover breakfasts a strawberry

138.29 --> 146.0
jelly sandwich small so let's see who is

142.82 --> 151.1
in chat today the YouTube chat which is

146.0 --> 153.47
directed straight through OBS a gym was

151.1 --> 155.15
first and then somebody that I highly

153.47 --> 157.13
suspect was a troll and he started

155.15 --> 163.15
basically lying for no good reason

157.13 --> 166.04
so I banned him a flatterer space man

163.15 --> 171.43
secret Asian man of course Robin Stanley

166.04 --> 171.42999999999998
Doc Michael also in the D livestream

172.0 --> 175.3
Amanda young

179.049 --> 188.29000000000002
dank dark michael should be going to bed

182.93 --> 191.409
probably Brenda from Asin goody

188.29 --> 193.76
workhorse stallion 8012

191.409 --> 199.76
seeking star water yeah good to see

193.76 --> 204.95
y'all this Sunday morning for the United

199.76 --> 217.25
States afternoon for Europe and night

204.95 --> 220.04
for Australia and Asia so starting a bit

217.25 --> 223.819
slow today because again I keep on

220.04 --> 230.239
staying online late it's all day life's

223.819 --> 233.32899999999998
false it's it's usually lift the veil

230.239 --> 238.579
that just keeps hanging me in there yes

233.329 --> 241.73000000000002
such good streams I do I am kind of

238.579 --> 243.229
curious about his calling system he does

241.73 --> 246.59
seem to have some trouble with it every

243.229 --> 249.769
now and then but he's been using that

246.59 --> 250.419
for a long time I wonder how he does

249.769 --> 254.84
that

250.419 --> 257.57
because I don't know it seems to like as

254.84 --> 259.549
long as they're calling they don't

257.57 --> 262.75
interrupt the call sound and all that

259.549 --> 266.419
the sound always gets through great and

262.75 --> 268.49
he gets a lot of callers and well I've

266.419 --> 270.59
had trouble with Skype it kind of works

268.49 --> 274.639
but the sound gets a bit wonky through

270.59 --> 278.44899999999996
OBS now I don't know if Nathan Stilton

274.639 --> 282.169
and uses like I don't know what sound

278.449 --> 284.96000000000004
system he uses he might have shared that

282.169 --> 288.099
kind of thing like a long time ago but I

284.96 --> 288.099
probably missed all that

288.22 --> 298.25
but yeah I'm very impressed by his setup

293.02 --> 301.84999999999997
and I kind of hope to maneuver myself a

298.25 --> 305.09
bit into having the similar type of

301.85 --> 307.22
quality for my show because I yeah every

305.09 --> 311.09
time it show us a blast now he's also

307.22 --> 312.92
very very informative and drags in news

311.09 --> 318.04999999999995
with a lot example so he's like a

312.92 --> 320.90000000000003
genuine news researcher me not so much I

318.05 --> 322.79
used to do that like ten years ago up

320.9 --> 324.95
until five years ago probably a lot I

322.79 --> 328.61
was obsessed mainly through Alex Jones

324.95 --> 333.02
but from that point of view when it was

328.61 --> 337.76
still yeah wasn't when he was still a

333.02 --> 342.95
little better but yeah since then I

337.76 --> 345.68
figured out about just how much

342.95 --> 347.87
misinformation is the news and even in

345.68 --> 351.14
alternative news and yeah Flat Earth

347.87 --> 355.64
especially highlighted that for me since

351.14 --> 357.74
then I've just I'm starting to find it a

355.64 --> 360.91999999999996
bit disturbing because every time I just

357.74 --> 366.14
dig into news it always gives me a

360.92 --> 368.3
feeling like yeah like it's all a little

366.14 --> 370.76
poison now sometimes it can still be

368.3 --> 372.83
very interesting but it just deters me

370.76 --> 376.84
from constantly digging into that

372.83 --> 381.09999999999997
because it literally makes me sick

376.84 --> 381.09999999999997
Nathan Proctor doesn't have those issues

382.33 --> 388.88
but yeah anyway I should be trying to

385.7 --> 392.11
stick to what I do best probably in that

388.88 --> 396.73
is stick to Flat Earth Cosmo Jeannie and

392.11 --> 402.32
science and alternative history

396.73 --> 407.69
spiritualism and yeah spiritual

402.32 --> 409.84999999999997
mechanics all that but yeah not

407.69 --> 415.28
everybody's always in for that and I

409.85 --> 417.20000000000005
guess also it's all because maybe what I

415.28 --> 419.80999999999995
like to talk about typically is more

417.2 --> 422.69
subject for the evenings for a lot of

419.81 --> 423.38
people well I don't know I don't know

422.69 --> 429.29
for sure

423.38 --> 431.65999999999997
oh yeah run from us and sure yeah sorry

429.29 --> 436.61
Brenda after that last appearance you

431.66 --> 439.40000000000003
made here it's like pardon me if I

436.61 --> 442.25
literally don't listen to a word you say

439.4 --> 445.21999999999997
ever again that was so ridiculous what

442.25 --> 447.65
you did just declaring outright victory

445.22 --> 450.19000000000005
that that was worse than what rumpus

447.65 --> 452.63
does and rumpus does it very funnily I

450.19 --> 459.68
think it's hilarious when rumpus does

452.63 --> 462.77
that he's been doing it you know no you

459.68 --> 465.8
don't know anything you don't have

462.77 --> 468.95
control over your own memory at all

465.8 --> 473.09000000000003
you can even answer the most basic of

468.95 --> 474.81
basic questions when pushed it's it's

473.09 --> 477.93899999999996
pathetic Rena

474.81 --> 477.939
[Music]

480.27 --> 485.65
yeah for those that don't know what I'm

483.58 --> 491.2
talking about with Brenda here I had a

485.65 --> 494.89
flat earther leeward episode I think a

491.2 --> 497.17
week ago now well Brenda if you could

494.89 --> 499.45
answer those basic questions when why

497.17 --> 504.45
don't you ever white why you always red

499.45 --> 504.45
herring why it's it's pathetic

511.01 --> 520.33
all right yeah Flat Earth earlybird

514.19 --> 523.6690000000001
episode 384 so that's five days ago

520.33 --> 526.1600000000001
Brenda how dare you so check that one

523.669 --> 530.18
out and you'll see exactly what I mean

526.16 --> 533.7199999999999
I really did my best to be as tolerant

530.18 --> 539.9
as I could but you made an absolute fool

533.72 --> 542.63
of yourself Brenda hey I see [ __ ] yous

539.9 --> 548.39
also in the D livestream at secret Asian

542.63 --> 557.47
man please do also visit my youtube

548.39 --> 561.11
channel but yeah I really like that a

557.47 --> 563.51
lot of the people I know on on YouTube

561.11 --> 566.24
are kind of doubling with delight now

563.51 --> 568.79
it's very easy to do it it's not a lot

566.24 --> 571.58
of hassle but it's just good to see all

568.79 --> 576.01
those familiar faces around now when I

571.58 --> 576.01
dig around in India life it's great

595.2 --> 599.61
yeah Brenda well that's why I am letting

597.72 --> 605.94
you continue I'm not even timing you out

599.61 --> 614.61
because I don't need to unless you get a

605.94 --> 617.1800000000001
really file of course but I know dank I

614.61 --> 617.1800000000001
know that you

625.999 --> 635.91
branded destroyed Anthony's good

632.49 --> 639.98
oh I'm sure Simon that in conspiracy

635.91 --> 639.98
Katz gave me award I'm sure they did

640.16 --> 647.579
well and I should be giving conspiracy

644.309 --> 652.679
cats an award - for appearing on my show

647.579 --> 655.2589999999999
and basically getting it right for once

652.679 --> 658.559
concerning the gas pressure and and the

655.259 --> 662.149
container because he said that on my

658.559 --> 662.149
show and he was absolutely correct

663.11 --> 674.269
Simon then however I don't know maybe

670.23 --> 674.269
you should get a like a coward award

675.259 --> 680.809
because he he always just runs away

702.06 --> 704.75
pop

709.85 --> 723.7900000000001
oh yeah yeah the crow it's here there he

721.76 --> 723.79
is

723.94 --> 729.5200000000001
I gave him the bit of bread earlier

736.16 --> 741.29
yeah George is doing just great I called

739.279 --> 746.149
him George for those who don't know this

741.29 --> 747.949
is a kind of well in the area a unique

746.149 --> 752.6
crow

747.949 --> 756.1099999999999
it's from yeah it's it's a mutation type

752.6 --> 760.279
of crow it's typically American they say

756.11 --> 765.11
I think where the crow gets partially

760.279 --> 770.42
white wings and I think it's slightly

765.11 --> 772.399
smaller than than the others he's he's

770.42 --> 774.019
always or he or she I think it's he is

772.399 --> 776.72
always a hanging around with two other

774.019 --> 779.149
crows that are just normal full black

776.72 --> 783.589
and they're slightly bigger and he seems

779.149 --> 785.18
to behave like they're his parents but

783.589 --> 787.5400000000001
that's been going on for a long time

785.18 --> 787.54
anyway

799.07 --> 808.7900000000001
yeah and this this crow is very cheeky

803.209 --> 813.699
and ease it seems very fearless no

808.79 --> 819.56
that's not evolution it's a mutation and

813.699 --> 822.019
I have studied its behavior and it has a

819.56 --> 825.709
complex because it knows it's different

822.019 --> 828.819
like it is different it has these types

825.709 --> 833.029
of wings other crows kind of seem to

828.819 --> 834.769
it's weird you can it's it's tough to

833.029 --> 836.66
explain what as I look at it and how it

834.769 --> 839.0
interacts with others it seems like

836.66 --> 842.12
other crows don't take him as serious

839.0 --> 846.17
but they don't like nag him or bully him

842.12 --> 848.779
or anything so but it knows it's

846.17 --> 851.06
different and it has some probably ego

848.779 --> 853.61
issues it gets very aggressive in

851.06 --> 857.06
defending its own food for example what

853.61 --> 859.3100000000001
more what it claims for itself not

857.06 --> 861.709
against the other crows though but it

859.31 --> 864.13
yeah like very vicious against other

861.709 --> 864.13
words

868.61 --> 872.41
now it's not evolution

873.76 --> 880.899
look it doesn't work because I don't

878.019 --> 883.87
think that this road has a lot of chance

880.899 --> 886.329
of procreating compared to others you

883.87 --> 889.47
may have a chance but it's very slim

886.329 --> 889.4699999999999
because he is different

898.21 --> 917.44
a Rob keen morning no no mutation

913.45 --> 921.82
doesn't work mutation actually works

917.44 --> 924.9100000000001
against procreation it lessens the

921.82 --> 928.5300000000001
chance is not just potentially socially

924.91 --> 933.0699999999999
among the among its kind but also

928.53 --> 934.03
genetically the mutations I tend to the

933.07 --> 937.7800000000001
worse they get

934.03 --> 941.79
and it's tax ok it's tax the worse it

937.78 --> 946.9
gets the more chances of infertility and

941.79 --> 951.3399999999999
erratic behavior so that's just how it

946.9 --> 953.61
works and evolution does not work it's a

951.34 --> 953.61
lie

959.24 --> 966.51
adaptation is how it works and even the

963.99 --> 970.26
genome project revealed that it revealed

966.51 --> 973.53
that it was the original assumptions

970.26 --> 974.9399999999999
were completely wrong and that seemed to

973.53 --> 978.4499999999999
be other things going on mainly

974.94 --> 981.6300000000001
epigenetics and that this is the key to

978.45 --> 985.5300000000001
adaptation make species adapt pretty

981.63 --> 987.6
quickly within a certain range of the

985.53 --> 992.3399999999999
genetic options it's amazing how it

987.6 --> 995.16
works but it always works like a circle

992.34 --> 997.38
and you have the center cord Center

995.16 --> 1000.62
logos of the genetic print you could say

997.38 --> 1004.67
and the more it deviates the tougher it

1000.62 --> 1009.5
becomes and yeah mutation outside of it

1004.67 --> 1013.31
basically breaks it off makes it

1009.5 --> 1017.03
unviable that's how it really works and

1013.31 --> 1020.18
that just shows you adaptation there's a

1017.03 --> 1022.5799999999999
certain genetic spectrum range and if

1020.18 --> 1026.9199999999998
you go too far outside it yeah you know

1022.58 --> 1026.92
it no longer functions as a species

1036.36 --> 1046.8899999999999
yeah it is acro Brenda you idiot

1040.71 --> 1049.1100000000001
it is a crow look you're not even here

1046.89 --> 1051.0300000000002
I've been here I've walked with these

1049.11 --> 1053.1299999999999
creatures I'm seeing it interact with

1051.03 --> 1062.06
others don't tell me it's not a crow you

1053.13 --> 1065.0600000000002
absolute [ __ ] it's not a magpie you've

1062.06 --> 1065.06
idiots

1065.08 --> 1070.1699999999998
[Music]

1066.74 --> 1072.9
there's Magpies around they're different

1070.17 --> 1076.2
very very different oh by the way thank

1072.9 --> 1078.74
you workhorse for the two Australian

1076.2 --> 1081.74
dollar super jet money for tea bags

1078.74 --> 1081.74
Thanks

1085.3 --> 1089.8
[Music]

1116.51 --> 1120.04
now it doesn't

1122.03 --> 1129.72
adaptation has a limited spectrum can

1126.15 --> 1132.72
push it far it can't keep on moving

1129.72 --> 1135.51
astray then it won't work it's always

1132.72 --> 1141.65
based on the central logos foundation

1135.51 --> 1146.24
the original print the ideal blueprint

1141.65 --> 1146.24
of the species

1150.2 --> 1155.76
yeah and it's not an Australian magpie

1153.66 --> 1158.309
either I've seen those as videos of that

1155.76 --> 1160.74
does it get very aggressive in the

1158.309 --> 1164.04
United States as well there are very

1160.74 --> 1168.75
different birds like come on like

1164.04 --> 1173.6599999999999
completely different obviously don't

1168.75 --> 1176.19
know anything about birds either branagh

1173.66 --> 1178.26
must be one of the most ignorant people

1176.19 --> 1180.95
have ever seen on the internet and

1178.26 --> 1180.95
that's saying something

1184.61 --> 1188.51
yes there is Brenda

1196.71 --> 1201.269
and it's it's not technically even ideal

1199.289 --> 1211.83
it's just the original the original

1201.269 --> 1215.759
specs but yeah practically they are

1211.83 --> 1219.4499999999998
ideal because they have the full

1215.759 --> 1225.33
adaptation range still like from an

1219.45 --> 1228.3600000000001
ideal from the original print adaptation

1225.33 --> 1235.86
is as the maximum potential from that

1228.36 --> 1239.4799999999998
point yeah there are Brenda it's called

1235.86 --> 1242.84
the design the design of the creator

1239.48 --> 1249.269
with all the aspects that come with it

1242.84 --> 1252.09
and the design building blocks that well

1249.269 --> 1254.249
we're all designed fundamentally by the

1252.09 --> 1257.9089999999999
Creator like eyes like all our organs

1254.249 --> 1260.669
all the amazing mechanisms and then he

1257.909 --> 1265.3790000000001
put it together in by in bio organic

1260.669 --> 1269.3400000000001
form and made several designs with that

1265.379 --> 1272.009
and with so yeah now I'm just giving a

1269.34 --> 1275.4189999999999
very basic description but what he

1272.009 --> 1277.74
actually did was so amazing and perfect

1275.419 --> 1282.289
energetically and with insight on what

1277.74 --> 1285.059
it does how it can perform that it's

1282.289 --> 1287.399
most people can't really get there with

1285.059 --> 1289.74
them I really care but I can feel that

1287.399 --> 1293.1899999999998
it is just beyond what most people would

1289.74 --> 1297.1490000000001
imagine and he would just create these

1293.19 --> 1301.799
things life beings that can procreate

1297.149 --> 1304.7299999999998
and adapt it's amazing that doesn't form

1301.799 --> 1307.73
out of itself out of a problem of of goo

1304.73 --> 1307.73
Brenda

1314.16 --> 1319.65
you can ignore God all you like Brenda

1325.5 --> 1328.74
hello Nathan

1346.18 --> 1358.8
oh really really you can well why don't

1354.91 --> 1363.0900000000001
you show me a life form spontaneously

1358.8 --> 1364.36
forming on the disposal right conditions

1363.09 --> 1368.01
okay

1364.36 --> 1368.01
wait show me that

1399.0 --> 1402.0
oh well right ace McLeod can make a good

1401.49 --> 1408.179
point

1402.0 --> 1410.82
I kind of agree but the funny thing is

1408.179 --> 1414.21
is that inner ignorant which is just

1410.82 --> 1420.12
idiotic she is kind of kind of like

1414.21 --> 1422.789
handing me points so there's the

1420.12 --> 1426.809
advantage to that as they try to derail

1422.789 --> 1429.21
us they hand us talking points to

1426.809 --> 1431.22
respond to because all these talking

1429.21 --> 1435.51
points that Brenda's trying to attack me

1431.22 --> 1439.02
with we've all been over that with them

1435.51 --> 1441.51
for hundreds of times hundreds of times

1439.02 --> 1443.4
we know probably every corner by

1441.51 --> 1444.45
instinct now because they try to attack

1443.4 --> 1448.289
us with it

1444.45 --> 1451.409
try to overwhelm us with like this body

1448.289 --> 1455.85
of science peer pressure nonsense and we

1451.409 --> 1458.3300000000002
adapted yeah we learned it but we'd

1455.85 --> 1461.01
normally don't talk about that nonsense

1458.33 --> 1464.34
unless it is a specifically brought up

1461.01 --> 1466.049
subject for today or something but hey

1464.34 --> 1467.8799999999999
if she's going to bring up these

1466.049 --> 1470.549
ridiculous statements it's just a good

1467.88 --> 1474.7800000000002
excuse for me to rebuttal that right on

1470.549 --> 1477.03
the spot and maybe point at some social

1474.78 --> 1480.77
media history here with some of these

1477.03 --> 1480.77
people that imperium my chat

1488.82 --> 1496.4099999999999
oh really organelles yeah well guess

1493.89 --> 1501.71
what organelles are not life-forms

1496.41 --> 1504.74
Brenda unless you can show me those

1501.71 --> 1510.66
perpetuating lis existing and

1504.74 --> 1513.9
procreating without a living cell host

1510.66 --> 1516.98
with genetics to support them that would

1513.9 --> 1516.98
be nice Brenda

1525.97 --> 1534.29
it's like what you're trying to say is

1528.56 --> 1542.1699999999998
that I don't know a bed or a chair in a

1534.29 --> 1545.21
house is a house and see it no it's not

1542.17 --> 1547.97
it's not life by itself it can't

1545.21 --> 1552.5900000000001
procreate it can sustain itself without

1547.97 --> 1558.95
a cell host so that doesn't make any

1552.59 --> 1562.07
sense Brenda the preconditions for life

1558.95 --> 1565.21
is procreation and self-sustaining

1562.07 --> 1569.95
that they can survive and procreate

1565.21 --> 1569.95
without some other host surrounding them

1588.1 --> 1597.1699999999998
yeah you can think of them as light

1590.33 --> 1601.31
forms well life does utilize those

1597.17 --> 1606.47
things those biomechanics as part of its

1601.31 --> 1608.95
its yeah of its system but it's like

1606.47 --> 1613.25
declaring that an organ is a

1608.95 --> 1618.07
self-sustaining life form no it actually

1613.25 --> 1621.47
needs the entire body to sustain it and

1618.07 --> 1625.01
procreate can do that by itself like

1621.47 --> 1628.3700000000001
your liver can survive without a human

1625.01 --> 1629.57
and then procreate you know that that's

1628.37 --> 1634.33
not how that works

1629.57 --> 1634.33
Brenda life is life

1648.96 --> 1653.07
that's getting really silly now

1661.71 --> 1670.05
I don't know I think God had a very

1667.11 --> 1673.7299999999998
tough lesson for Brenda and that's

1670.05 --> 1677.99
probably why she has so much trouble

1673.73 --> 1682.88
embracing him because she feels

1677.99 --> 1686.76
unjustified from her point of view as

1682.88 --> 1689.5800000000002
what the creator made her and made her

1686.76 --> 1693.0
go through but that's probably because

1689.58 --> 1696.27
she just completely underestimates where

1693.0 --> 1697.79
she could end up although at this point

1696.27 --> 1699.81
I don't know I don't know how many

1697.79 --> 1705.84
pharmaceuticals she's gone through how

1699.81 --> 1708.45
many psycho psychologically they're

1705.84 --> 1712.02
railing things she's let herself go

1708.45 --> 1719.06
through in order for her to ever reach

1712.02 --> 1723.6
that point in her life but God gave her

1719.06 --> 1725.85
plenty of opportunity I bet yeah Brenda

1723.6 --> 1729.6299999999999
that's the funny thing you don't have to

1725.85 --> 1733.4099999999999
believe in God for creation and the

1729.63 --> 1737.4
Creator to exist it's there and yeah he

1733.41 --> 1743.1000000000001
gives you the choice to not believe it's

1737.4 --> 1744.24
the choice it's part of the design it's

1743.1 --> 1748.7099999999998
called a mistake

1744.24 --> 1750.84
allows you to make mistakes allows you

1748.71 --> 1753.27
to make endless mistakes your entire

1750.84 --> 1755.2099999999998
life if you can bear it because making

1753.27 --> 1757.92
mistakes comes with consequences

1755.21 --> 1761.88
cumulative consequences more and more

1757.92 --> 1765.8100000000002
and the more you ignore it the more you

1761.88 --> 1768.8400000000001
step away from your senses that tell you

1765.81 --> 1771.33
you're doing things wrong the harder it

1768.84 --> 1774.1499999999999
will be to even figure remember that it

1771.33 --> 1776.49
exists and then eventually you dwell in

1774.15 --> 1782.75
the darkness consciously you with your

1776.49 --> 1786.1200000000001
conscious it's very very different

1782.75 --> 1789.72
not very fulfilling on the long run I

1786.12 --> 1792.9599999999998
can tell you that's because I used to be

1789.72 --> 1800.1000000000001
kind of they're not not as bad as this

1792.96 --> 1805.95
my god so embarrassing but I was in a

1800.1 --> 1808.56
lot of denial like 20 years ago but it

1805.95 --> 1809.5800000000002
was just too preoccupied with doing

1808.56 --> 1812.31
other things

1809.58 --> 1816.0
I wouldn't like be talking about my

1812.31 --> 1819.1799999999998
weirdo ID I kind of knew it was off in a

1816.0 --> 1821.99
way I was just trying to figure it out

1819.18 --> 1829.71
in my own way I wanted to do it my way

1821.99 --> 1831.23
and I was it's like in the in the root

1829.71 --> 1833.96
of Steiner spectrum it's slightly

1831.23 --> 1837.66
Luciferian not super I wasn't like I

1833.96 --> 1844.3700000000001
openly gonna defy God I was just trying

1837.66 --> 1849.2900000000002
to see how much of what I thought about

1844.37 --> 1852.1499999999999
the Bible and Christ was really real and

1849.29 --> 1854.1599999999999
well I'm still kind of doing it in my

1852.15 --> 1855.96
own way I'm just more careful I

1854.16 --> 1857.3700000000001
understand more about the Bible in

1855.96 --> 1859.02
Christ I understand more about the

1857.37 --> 1861.78
designer I understand so much more that

1859.02 --> 1864.92
I really didn't that much had feelings

1861.78 --> 1869.94
for a little but I was still very

1864.92 --> 1873.24
distracted by the media Luciferian

1869.94 --> 1877.41
liberal ideas and they've kind of now

1873.24 --> 1879.71
faded but the tendencies are still there

1877.41 --> 1879.71
a bit

1885.28 --> 1890.27
but but that's what it is you try to

1887.96 --> 1895.8400000000001
figure it out complex things sometimes

1890.27 --> 1898.7
and then yeah reality may show you

1895.84 --> 1901.01
irreversibly that you were wrong about

1898.7 --> 1902.8700000000001
something very fundamental and if you

1901.01 --> 1906.02
then don't step away if you choose to

1902.87 --> 1910.1299999999999
ignore it then well a piece of your

1906.02 --> 1912.76
consciousness will close itself off it's

1910.13 --> 1912.7600000000002
very tough

1918.28 --> 1925.33
it's tough to open it up again after

1921.16 --> 1927.7900000000002
that you have to get through

1925.33 --> 1932.9499999999998
well usually feelings of embarrassment

1927.79 --> 1935.29
and sometimes fear can be very personal

1932.95 --> 1937.48
but that's why people do that because

1935.29 --> 1940.74
they really can't handle those feelings

1937.48 --> 1944.5
at the time they they can deal with

1940.74 --> 1949.42
letting go the paradigm they held up

1944.5 --> 1951.82
high turning out to be false it's very

1949.42 --> 1955.8000000000002
tough on people spirit especially if

1951.82 --> 1955.8
they invested a lot of energy into it

1984.43 --> 1992.65
man secret Asian man your stream is kind

1987.58 --> 1996.82
of interrupting a lot I've noticed that

1992.65 --> 1999.49
with some other streams as well so I

1996.82 --> 2001.32
hope that de life can actually handle

1999.49 --> 2003.59
the new amount of people getting on

2001.32 --> 2003.59
there

2010.84 --> 2017.5
I hope they got plenty of surfer backup

2013.66 --> 2021.64
space because yeah they're they're gonna

2017.5 --> 2028.48
explode in in content absolutely they

2021.64 --> 2031.3200000000002
already are so I wonder I hope they'll

2028.48 --> 2031.32
be able to fix it

2059.98 --> 2065.44
ha I'd like this multi-streaming thing

2063.0 --> 2069.0
going back and forth in different types

2065.44 --> 2069.0
of chats I like that

2083.76 --> 2095.38
okay is it win time again what is it

2090.55 --> 2100.0
about w IGN that inspires so many people

2095.38 --> 2104.4
to put that behind words is it so

2100.0 --> 2104.4
unusual that combination of letters

2115.15 --> 2127.779
it fits okay right yeah by the way for

2124.749 --> 2132.249
those people that are not touch for me

2127.779 --> 2135.67
it's kind of weird because WI JN also

2132.249 --> 2139.9199999999996
means in Dutch wine as in the grape

2135.67 --> 2139.92
based alcoholic drink

2146.47 --> 2156.93
and so my name could also be interpreted

2149.47 --> 2162.97
as nectar of the of the gods the are

2156.93 --> 2164.8289999999997
that that kind of idea yeah it's my

2162.97 --> 2168.8489999999997
mother thought about my name a lot I

2164.829 --> 2172.02
think and they were always very deep

2168.849 --> 2172.02
into language so

2188.31 --> 2192.62
okay it's getting kinda silly now

2218.8 --> 2224.01
it's a win-win situation Oh God

2229.9 --> 2241.0190000000002
that's actually pretty catchy God should

2236.65 --> 2242.9
have been doing that and win-win

2241.019 --> 2244.6499999999996
situation

2242.9 --> 2247.869
[Music]

2244.65 --> 2256.239
that's terrible actually but it's also

2247.869 --> 2262.559
kind of funny right oh it's my chat

2256.239 --> 2262.559
stuck no right

2266.49 --> 2272.4599999999996
my god is Rena still talking about this

2269.92 --> 2272.46
nonsense

2273.63 --> 2277.38
yeah I've just

2288.29 --> 2292.82
yeah yeah you know what it's so funny

2291.05 --> 2295.9300000000003
Brenda that you mentioned these things

2292.82 --> 2298.4300000000003
in the same row similarities between

2295.93 --> 2299.18
creationists conspiracy theorists and

2298.43 --> 2304.58
flat-earthers

2299.18 --> 2307.3999999999996
yeah you know what we all share we're

2304.58 --> 2314.0
all right we're all on the side of truth

2307.4 --> 2318.25
and against the system of delusion and

2314.0 --> 2322.37
lies and fake news and control

2318.25 --> 2326.24
psychological warfare you are on that

2322.37 --> 2329.63
side that it's blatantly obvious that

2326.24 --> 2333.9399999999996
anyone takes like 10 minute

2329.63 --> 2333.94
minutes to study your overall behavior

2354.7 --> 2360.75
yeah what if what if what if I'm not

2375.079 --> 2385.38
Brenda eh Brenda nobody cares what you

2380.94 --> 2388.2000000000003
believed and when nobody nobody here you

2385.38 --> 2391.829
may maybe not nobody cares whether you

2388.2 --> 2396.7799999999997
do or not but nobody cares about what

2391.829 --> 2398.6400000000003
you believe you know why because you're

2396.78 --> 2400.98
delusional and you're straight-faced

2398.64 --> 2404.67
liar and you can't even answer basic

2400.98 --> 2406.89
questions you get words wrong you double

2404.67 --> 2409.71
speak in plain sight in a span of a

2406.89 --> 2411.66
minute and then deny you did it even

2409.71 --> 2415.829
when you hear the very recording playing

2411.66 --> 2421.549
afterward nobody cares what you believe

2415.829 --> 2421.549
Brenda you're an idiot and a liar

2434.96 --> 2438.059
[Music]

2449.76 --> 2455.13
yeah well mark colored if you're gonna

2452.16 --> 2456.81
be asking those questions then you're

2455.13 --> 2459.54
kind of presuming that there's any

2456.81 --> 2462.06
normal human social interacting

2459.54 --> 2466.65
mechanics there in order for her to be

2462.06 --> 2469.59
subjected susceptible to inquiry and she

2466.65 --> 2473.7000000000003
is not she does not answer questions

2469.59 --> 2476.19
ever basic questions only when she feels

2473.7 --> 2477.93
that she needs to in order to make some

2476.19 --> 2480.9
kind of temporary point that she can

2477.93 --> 2484.94
answer questions but when it matters she

2480.9 --> 2490.02
never does she's obsessed with winning

2484.94 --> 2492.21
so obsessed that she's barely even

2490.02 --> 2495.21
consciously presence in her social

2492.21 --> 2498.42
communication she is just a ego spirit

2495.21 --> 2500.79
wanting to win no matter what it's even

2498.42 --> 2503.85
kind of the egos probably even separated

2500.79 --> 2509.88
so much from her very conscious and just

2503.85 --> 2515.94
tearing things complete delusion one of

2509.88 --> 2519.69
the worst cases it's probably that

2515.94 --> 2522.15
Brenda can still miraculously function

2519.69 --> 2525.0
in society and pretend to be somewhat

2522.15 --> 2527.13
normal human being and they in the

2525.0 --> 2529.8
liberal world nowaday people like she

2527.13 --> 2533.52
kind of falls in line of what is weirdly

2529.8 --> 2536.2200000000003
enough accepted such but say a hundred

2533.52 --> 2538.05
years ago people that act like that not

2536.22 --> 2539.73
even like me okay people like me a

2538.05 --> 2541.77
hundred years ago yeah we would get in

2539.73 --> 2543.869
trouble because we get in trouble with

2541.77 --> 2544.41
Authority for speaking out that [ __ ] oh

2543.869 --> 2547.44
yeah

2544.41 --> 2549.72
Brenda they would just end up in a

2547.44 --> 2553.08
nuthouse because they're freaking

2549.72 --> 2555.5099999999998
delusional idiots that can't even

2553.08 --> 2558.859
normally communicate that's where Brenda

2555.51 --> 2558.8590000000004
would have ended up a hundred years ago

2560.21 --> 2565.53
but now in this age yeah people like

2563.22 --> 2567.83
that can just roam around and do their

2565.53 --> 2567.8300000000004
thing

2575.73 --> 2583.63
yeah and by the way not saying that she

2581.02 --> 2586.72
should because those types of north

2583.63 --> 2591.01
houses back then it's like a prison for

2586.72 --> 2593.89
crazy people to just store him and that

2591.01 --> 2596.6800000000003
was a terrible time it's like early

2593.89 --> 2598.99
psychiatry you it was pretty horrific so

2596.68 --> 2603.3999999999996
I wouldn't wish that to her but just

2598.99 --> 2606.49
saying you know just saying it's really

2603.4 --> 2609.28
because of this age and what is big yeah

2606.49 --> 2614.2299999999996
what's weirdly enough been forced to be

2609.28 --> 2616.69
tolerated like that makes Brenda people

2614.23 --> 2627.4
like Brenda just be out function in

2616.69 --> 2628.86
society yeah all that attention isn't it

2627.4 --> 2634.09
amazing

2628.86 --> 2637.4700000000003
yeah but yeah then again I do have a

2634.09 --> 2638.67
fascination for crazy people always have

2637.47 --> 2641.1699999999996
[Music]

2638.67 --> 2643.27
my entire life thought they were

2641.17 --> 2647.23
fascinating especially people that were

2643.27 --> 2652.21
socially ostracized as I felt like that

2647.23 --> 2653.89
myself a lot and I would almost I needed

2652.21 --> 2656.53
to study these people in order to

2653.89 --> 2660.0299999999997
understand my own position and what I

2656.53 --> 2663.03
could do with it so was a necessary

2660.03 --> 2663.03
curiosity

2669.57 --> 2675.8
yeah I'm sure you did sure you had a

2674.49 --> 2679.0499999999997
great childhood

2675.8 --> 2682.11
yeah but about that trauma

2679.05 --> 2683.8500000000004
I guess the trauma just sunk in there

2682.11 --> 2685.83
and completely bypassed your

2683.85 --> 2688.2
consciousness I think you were probably

2685.83 --> 2693.5099999999998
in general traumatized by the mind

2688.2 --> 2696.21
control of media and liberal social

2693.51 --> 2698.82
culture and then you won't see that

2696.21 --> 2700.98
you're traumatized because you literally

2698.82 --> 2703.26
don't see that it's trauma you think

2700.98 --> 2706.26
that that's normal and that's part of

2703.26 --> 2709.53
the liberal new way of going about

2706.26 --> 2712.2000000000003
socially so yeah to you that probably

2709.53 --> 2714.4500000000003
all seems just hunky-dory and great and

2712.2 --> 2717.24
I'm not saying that your parents were

2714.45 --> 2720.75
mean to you that doesn't mean that they

2717.24 --> 2726.87
were actually good for your mental

2720.75 --> 2732.48
health on the long run yeah yeah you

2726.87 --> 2734.94
know denial is the first step yeah

2732.48 --> 2737.7
nothing bad happened yeah that's why you

2734.94 --> 2742.92
ended up here the being the person that

2737.7 --> 2745.5899999999997
you are Brenda yeah and you don't

2742.92 --> 2749.07
necessarily have to be personally abused

2745.59 --> 2752.28
in a physical way in order to get

2749.07 --> 2757.56
traumatized you can just be traumatized

2752.28 --> 2760.1400000000003
by being exposed to crazy ideas without

2757.56 --> 2762.7799999999997
any defense without any advice from a

2760.14 --> 2767.24
parent as to how to properly regard that

2762.78 --> 2767.2400000000002
yeah you can damn well be traumatized

2778.66 --> 2785.8399999999997
[Music]

2779.86 --> 2790.27
Wow talk of why look at that guys I do

2785.84 --> 2796.4900000000002
not get abused by you people though

2790.27 --> 2798.59
except on the debates where well when

2796.49 --> 2801.6499999999996
things get kind of abusive and neat you

2798.59 --> 2804.44
even cry out about it Brenda yeah you

2801.65 --> 2806.54
did it again did it again you two-faced

2804.44 --> 2809.69
liar yeah you do complain about being

2806.54 --> 2811.7799999999997
abused Oh or did you forget that because

2809.69 --> 2815.2000000000003
you're not completely fully conscious

2811.78 --> 2818.96
did your ego make you say that again

2815.2 --> 2821.6899999999996
Brenda yeah you do get abused by people

2818.96 --> 2825.19
probably pretty brutally by Nathan and

2821.69 --> 2829.55
you allow it you love it

2825.19 --> 2832.7000000000003
hit me Nathan uh you love it oh yeah you

2829.55 --> 2835.4900000000002
got abuse and you don't even see it

2832.7 --> 2838.1299999999997
right because you had an argument you

2835.49 --> 2840.08
had an argument and you had to win that

2838.13 --> 2841.96
argument your ego told you you had to

2840.08 --> 2843.38
win that argument so you just said oh no

2841.96 --> 2848.78
no I

2843.38 --> 2852.2000000000003
I'm never abused I have no trauma uh see

2848.78 --> 2854.15
I win because you're wrong oh except for

2852.2 --> 2857.93
all those times where you complain about

2854.15 --> 2865.4900000000002
it constantly Brenda you freaking

2857.93 --> 2867.2
lunatic you two-faced lying idiot no way

2865.49 --> 2870.4399999999996
you certainly were acting like a child

2867.2 --> 2872.9199999999996
and hey I wasn't even specific about

2870.44 --> 2876.4700000000003
child trauma I'm just talking about

2872.92 --> 2878.35
societal trauma you know it doesn't have

2876.47 --> 2881.54
to be specifically when you're a child

2878.35 --> 2883.67
when you become a teenager and you're

2881.54 --> 2887.21
certainly subjected to all kinds of

2883.67 --> 2890.9300000000003
media and or your hormones making you

2887.21 --> 2893.2400000000002
want to do be very extreme or something

2890.93 --> 2895.8799999999997
and then society hands you these crazy

2893.24 --> 2897.7099999999996
things to do with that oh yeah that'll

2895.88 --> 2901.9300000000003
that'll traumatize you you don't have to

2897.71 --> 2901.93
be a little child to be traumatized

2906.03 --> 2914.7400000000002
no I never happened yeah sorry Brenda

2945.33 --> 2951.96
profiling it said what that's what I can

3062.39 --> 3068.43
why do you always have to get nasty what

3066.27 --> 3072.3
is it about Karen bees is this some kind

3068.43 --> 3080.0699999999997
of weird like I won't even be going

3072.3 --> 3081.96
there I don't know what it is about you

3080.07 --> 3084.9900000000002
Karen Lee but you always seem to bring

3081.96 --> 3087.53
the GAM out in a lot of people every

3084.99 --> 3087.5299999999997
single time

3125.87 --> 3128.87
yeah

3141.03 --> 3155.4500000000003
yeah Karen B I don't know if I shouldn't

3144.78 --> 3155.4500000000003
even be what the prenda it's just

3155.599 --> 3160.219
yeah and it seems to be with all sexes

3158.299 --> 3169.0389999999998
it's not just the males it's also

3160.219 --> 3171.4990000000003
females or whatever seemed to yeah man

3169.039 --> 3174.4990000000003
but I could barely imagine what would

3171.499 --> 3182.8689999999997
happen Garin if you at some point tried

3174.499 --> 3184.9399999999996
to approach or were like having a flat

3182.869 --> 3190.489
earth debate type setup where you would

3184.94 --> 3195.789
be doing what Nathan does to ballers if

3190.489 --> 3198.4990000000003
you could muster that gap of energy man

3195.789 --> 3202.579
think that all these people would

3198.499 --> 3211.729
literally just lose their minds they

3202.579 --> 3214.4790000000003
would lose sleep over it okay Brenda

3211.729 --> 3214.479
stop it

3215.65 --> 3220.7290000000003
you're not gonna get timed out but I'm

3219.229 --> 3223.359
not gonna let you show that kind of

3220.729 --> 3223.359
message here

3280.16 --> 3284.83
all right well yeah Brenda

3288.03 --> 3295.1400000000003
I think Brenda you severely

3290.33 --> 3297.0
underestimate how repulsive you and

3295.14 --> 3304.41
others like you

3297.0 --> 3308.64
a constantly attack Karen can be yeah of

3304.41 --> 3312.1099999999997
course she doesn't doesn't tolerate that

3308.64 --> 3315.9
kind of thing it's who would you know I

3312.11 --> 3318.63
almost do I sometimes do because I

3315.9 --> 3321.27
specifically chose that I should grow

3318.63 --> 3325.32
skin for it because I was much worse I

3321.27 --> 3328.8
was way worse than Karen B at the

3325.32 --> 3331.05
beginning remember that guys my god I

3328.8 --> 3336.8900000000003
could be so seriously triggered by

3331.05 --> 3339.6800000000003
ballers back then fairy loose cannon

3336.89 --> 3342.39
yeah growing skin is very tough

3339.68 --> 3344.46
especially if you see a lot of detail

3342.39 --> 3348.45
because then you see how disgusting

3344.46 --> 3351.96
things really are and how terrible the

3348.45 --> 3356.6899999999996
delusion is that they carry see more

3351.96 --> 3356.69
detail it's not a pleasant sight people

3359.93 --> 3367.7599999999998
yeah but we don't need to trigger anyone

3363.84 --> 3373.98
Casey Jones done don't get all basic

3367.76 --> 3377.4
stay base don't be basic okay basic is

3373.98 --> 3380.42
not good basic is poller ization basic

3377.4 --> 3384.77
is oversimplification basic is lazy

3380.42 --> 3384.77
don't be basic be based

3385.25 --> 3389.88
that's exactly how I'm gonna call this

3387.99 --> 3393.3689999999997
hangout that's a great name

3389.88 --> 3393.369
[Music]

3402.5 --> 3405.659
[Music]

3410.8 --> 3428.3500000000004
Neal hey what's this damn you you do

3441.51 --> 3444.6290000000004
[Music]

3447.65 --> 3455.04
right

3450.39 --> 3456.0299999999997
I don't know stallion I think that's a

3455.04 --> 3460.8
little too far

3456.03 --> 3462.6000000000004
myself yeah Karen beep yeah it would be

3460.8 --> 3467.96
better if you wouldn't say those things

3462.6 --> 3471.39
in here Karen be it's a little far

3467.96 --> 3474.12
unless you can prove it unless you've

3471.39 --> 3476.79
literally caught Brenda verbally saying

3474.12 --> 3478.77
it's because Chad means [ __ ] if you

3476.79 --> 3481.29
caught her verbally saying yeah I was

3478.77 --> 3484.47
abused as a child that's another matter

3481.29 --> 3486.06
but as long as you don't you shouldn't

3484.47 --> 3490.7099999999996
be saying that kind of thing about

3486.06 --> 3492.99
people like unless it's just in a super

3490.71 --> 3494.51
goofy joking mood like an Owen Benjamin

3492.99 --> 3500.6299999999997
Chad oh whatever

3494.51 --> 3500.63
well maybe not you know what I mean but

3501.44 --> 3509.4
it's better not to do that here

3504.89 --> 3511.0499999999997
progress yeah yeah now it's called a

3509.4 --> 3514.8
minor correction Brenda there's no

3511.05 --> 3519.6600000000003
progress on your side see see she's

3514.8 --> 3522.1800000000003
obsessed obsessed with winning it's it's

3519.66 --> 3524.67
like the only thing that feeds her and

3522.18 --> 3526.56
that's her ego which is the majority of

3524.67 --> 3529.53
her consciousness not much of her

3526.56 --> 3531.59
consciousness left so ego and winning is

3529.53 --> 3535.2000000000003
the only thing that feeds our see the

3531.59 --> 3539.4
exclamation mark see because she thinks

3535.2 --> 3542.7
oh my god I said I I said maybe Karen B

3539.4 --> 3545.1600000000003
did something a little wrong and my god

3542.7 --> 3550.74
and she certainly thinks it's a win it's

3545.16 --> 3555.8599999999997
a win she won Brenda won my god it's

3550.74 --> 3559.02
amazing no you know you didn't I just

3555.86 --> 3563.1
made a minor correction to a good

3559.02 --> 3565.17
follower of mine to clear up how I like

3563.1 --> 3565.95
people to behave here in my chat overall

3565.17 --> 3572.09
that's all

3565.95 --> 3572.0899999999997
Oh is Randy having a show Nathan

3573.8 --> 3578.2400000000002
always having a show right now is he

3579.14 --> 3586.1
would have been nice if you would have

3582.05 --> 3586.1000000000004
conveyed this with me before

3607.05 --> 3614.6600000000003
I didn't hear myself saying yes but okay

3612.33 --> 3614.66
Nathan

3618.57 --> 3621.7490000000003
[Music]

3627.65 --> 3630.94
shut up right now

3640.49 --> 3648.6699999999996
a Nathan see Brenda and Chet

3649.03 --> 3653.8300000000004
let's see that she's doing it again

3674.48 --> 3687.47
I think your your analysis of Brenda is

3681.58 --> 3689.63
180 degrees off Fyodor Dostoevsky or

3687.47 --> 3699.7999999999997
maybe you were trying to be sarcastic

3689.63 --> 3702.85
but if you are then yeah you didn't drop

3699.8 --> 3702.8500000000004
any hints to it

3704.93 --> 3708.0299999999997
[Music]

3732.03 --> 3738.36
I'm almost tempted to get Nathan and

3735.59 --> 3741.1800000000003
Brenda on through Skype but I think that

3738.36 --> 3746.3900000000003
