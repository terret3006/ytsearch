81.36 --> 85.68
being a little late i

83.2 --> 87.92
i got up very late today a very busy

85.68 --> 91.60000000000001
night last night

87.92 --> 94.88
uh the weather today is yeah

91.6 --> 96.15899999999999
what a contrast it's completely

94.88 --> 100.15899999999999
different

96.159 --> 104.24000000000001
it's yeah it's actually pretty amazing

100.159 --> 107.52000000000001
sunny like really sunny and bright

104.24 --> 112.64
very bright type of winter sun

107.52 --> 115.36
very beautiful very blinding

112.64 --> 116.88
but yeah it's it's enervating it there's

115.36 --> 121.36
a lot of energy in the air

116.88 --> 123.92
also it's quite different from yesterday

121.36 --> 125.52
it is kind of cold though but still it's

123.92 --> 127.759
not

125.52 --> 128.959
that cold so when i went out for

127.759 --> 132.0
groceries quickly

128.959 --> 134.16
as quick as i could i like didn't put a

132.0 --> 136.56
scarf on or anything and it's very very

134.16 --> 136.56
doable

139.52 --> 147.36
and a crow i gave them some bread

144.0 --> 147.36
and he's enjoying that

151.04 --> 153.35999999999999
all right

155.28 --> 158.56
but yeah yesterday night was

157.4 --> 160.8
unsurprisingly

158.56 --> 162.0
very restless not just for me it was

160.8 --> 165.20000000000002
just in the air

162.0 --> 167.2
like my uh roommate friend

165.2 --> 168.23899999999998
also couldn't sleep and she's not even

167.2 --> 170.48
paying attention

168.239 --> 171.519
to like whatever is going on out there

170.48 --> 174.64
too much

171.519 --> 178.64000000000001
but she just couldn't sleep so like at

174.64 --> 181.83999999999997
five o'clock no less i was outside

178.64 --> 182.879
like was it four o'clock right i think

181.84 --> 185.44
four o'clock

182.879 --> 186.879
at that point i went out like she

185.44 --> 189.599
knocked on my door

186.879 --> 191.12
like from the outs like what this is

189.599 --> 192.79999999999998
that's never happened before but

191.12 --> 194.879
yeah she just wanted some distraction

192.8 --> 196.8
because she's been she'd been playing a

194.879 --> 198.159
game for like too long couldn't get it

196.8 --> 201.519
out of her head

198.159 --> 201.519
so i gave her some tips

203.44 --> 209.76
right uh yeah got green tea with me

206.72 --> 212.64
let's use in chat before i continue

209.76 --> 215.12
robin stanley was first obermical tom

212.64 --> 215.11999999999998
parker

215.28 --> 218.4
yeah good to see you too hope the rest

217.36 --> 221.20000000000002
will follow soon

218.4 --> 221.20000000000002
it's wednesday

224.08 --> 230.959
and yeah i haven't actually

227.28 --> 232.239
checked any news situation or anything

230.959 --> 235.599
maybe we should do that

232.239 --> 240.959
let's see what happened like

235.599 --> 243.83999999999997
did they finish counting the votes yet

240.959 --> 246.0
where's that i wonder where that's gonna

243.84 --> 246.0
be

247.68 --> 250.72
they're probably still counting it at

249.2 --> 252.48
the moment

250.72 --> 254.72
there's a lot of analysis and

252.48 --> 259.12
predictions it's all over the place and

254.72 --> 259.12
and even completely nonsensical at times

259.759 --> 267.28000000000003
it will be weeks oh [ __ ] really

263.6 --> 270.88
damn okay

267.28 --> 270.88
so that's that's going to take a while

271.52 --> 276.15999999999997
all right well

280.84 --> 283.84
uh

295.28 --> 298.55999999999995
oh you three by the way

299.199 --> 311.84000000000003
michigan in the air still expected what

302.96 --> 311.84
hmm right anyway

314.4 --> 319.35999999999996
yesterday flat earth debate i don't

317.12 --> 321.199
think i was very active

319.36 --> 324.72
it's also probably because i went for

321.199 --> 324.72
groceries somewhere halfway

329.759 --> 332.32
i don't know

334.08 --> 338.15999999999997
was there somebody on there i think it

336.88 --> 341.36
was that well

338.16 --> 344.0
it's called he called again that the the

341.36 --> 344.0
troll guy

344.08 --> 347.75899999999996
the other day i don't remember his name

345.68 --> 350.72
i don't really care too much

347.759 --> 352.639
he's just he was like being unusually

350.72 --> 357.36
conceiting for a baller

352.639 --> 359.12
so it it kind of reminded me a bit about

357.36 --> 362.08000000000004
mark taylor i told him that

359.12 --> 364.319
even i think but yeah that was a

362.08 --> 366.479
flattered debate yesterday

364.319 --> 368.0
there was no benjamin life it was pretty

366.479 --> 370.56
interesting i didn't make a lot of

368.0 --> 373.84
detail notes but

370.56 --> 376.88
uh yeah and then somewhere john

373.84 --> 379.11999999999995
huey john went live i got on there as

376.88 --> 382.639
well

379.12 --> 386.56
didn't get too involved yeah

382.639 --> 389.52
uh much later

386.56 --> 396.72
like in the middle of the night too

389.52 --> 396.71999999999997
rasta had called me over skype

399.86 --> 403.04
[Music]

403.52 --> 409.84
okay that was the sound of crows

406.84 --> 409.84
bickering

411.919 --> 415.599
so it's nice and clear everywhere

420.84 --> 423.84
interesting

434.84 --> 437.84
right

441.36 --> 445.84000000000003
myself gaming i don't think yeah i don't

445.039 --> 450.56
think i watched

445.84 --> 454.88
anything on netflix

450.56 --> 459.28000000000003
no been doing a lot of self-reflecting

454.88 --> 459.28
surprise surprise what i do that every

462.84 --> 465.84
day

465.919 --> 469.12
because i yeah i'm currently in mode

468.319 --> 472.40000000000003
where i

469.12 --> 478.16
have a lot of anticipations as to for

472.4 --> 479.75899999999996
where i can go because yeah there's more

478.16 --> 481.84000000000003
like my clothes and everything they

479.759 --> 483.68
deteriorated over time and now i just

481.84 --> 484.63899999999995
figured out i just realized that

483.68 --> 488.16
basically

484.639 --> 490.639
yeah my last pretty much remaining

488.16 --> 491.199
whole pair of views that were working

490.639 --> 493.759
are now

491.199 --> 495.759
also breaking apart to that level where

493.759 --> 498.08000000000004
i probably can't fix them anymore it's a

495.759 --> 501.36
pretty annoying realization

498.08 --> 504.08
i just really somehow

501.36 --> 504.08000000000004
sometime

504.639 --> 508.8
managed to get like a whole bulk of

506.639 --> 512.0
money together

508.8 --> 512.32
i'm not that's not gonna well it would

512.0 --> 516.479
be

512.32 --> 520.32
weird to just like do a gofundme

516.479 --> 522.719
here i don't know but i have to get some

520.32 --> 523.44
new clothes and i have to do it right so

522.719 --> 525.12
that it's not

523.44 --> 526.72
because the last time i tried it with

525.12 --> 528.8
those pants remember

526.72 --> 530.64
and then i got them from my stepmother

528.8 --> 532.959
was really nice

530.64 --> 534.3199999999999
but then like it yeah it almost

532.959 --> 536.0
literally fell apart

534.32 --> 539.44
when i didn't get the right fabric

536.0 --> 542.72
because i had to do makeshift and that

539.44 --> 546.24
well that doesn't work that doesn't work

542.72 --> 546.24
with my system with what i do

546.839 --> 550.72
right but yeah in order to do that you

549.76 --> 552.959
just need

550.72 --> 554.64
sufficient amount of money available and

552.959 --> 557.76
then not be concerned

554.64 --> 559.519
by scaving off the ants while yeah

557.76 --> 561.6
making it incomplete

559.519 --> 562.88
ending up in the same type of situation

561.6 --> 566.08
again

562.88 --> 567.04
right but that's been on my mind and at

566.08 --> 571.519
the same time

567.04 --> 574.399
like the the company my dad and me

571.519 --> 576.32
it's doing it yeah it's yielding some

574.399 --> 579.04
promising future

576.32 --> 581.36
traits that i might utilize and i don't

579.04 --> 584.0
know exactly even how much money i could

581.36 --> 586.5600000000001
potentially get together from that

584.0 --> 587.12
so i have to kind of check that out but

586.56 --> 590.3199999999999
hey i

587.12 --> 593.279
told everyone i've been sort of talking

590.32 --> 598.6400000000001
about this in the background a little

593.279 --> 602.079
that like yeah end of 2020 it should be

598.64 --> 602.48
like out of that valley and in onto the

602.079 --> 604.4799999999999
hill

602.48 --> 607.839
and i don't know how high the hill will

604.48 --> 610.48
go so that's why i'm kind of into

607.839 --> 612.0790000000001
growing enthusiastic anticipation

610.48 --> 614.9590000000001
because there's a lot

612.079 --> 619.279
i need a lot of money just for

614.959 --> 621.68
maintenance [ __ ]

619.279 --> 623.519
yeah besides just trying to eat and

621.68 --> 626.8
ensure that i can pay my rent and the

623.519 --> 626.8
bills and all that [ __ ] so

627.76 --> 637.12
thumbs downs on sketchy anything what

633.519 --> 639.279
yeah that's to buy high quality right

637.12 --> 641.44
well for example these shoes these types

639.279 --> 645.76
of shoes that i got

641.44 --> 647.36
they're not super luxurious but they are

645.76 --> 650.88
still

647.36 --> 652.72
there's enough shoe on there

650.88 --> 655.279
that they tend to be a little bit more

652.72 --> 657.279
expensive than the average shoe

655.279 --> 658.56
now i know exactly where to get them i

657.279 --> 662.64
get them like on a

658.56 --> 665.3599999999999
on an outside market a batter low play

662.64 --> 665.8389999999999
i've been getting them from that guy for

665.36 --> 670.72
like

665.839 --> 670.72
20 years almost he knows me

671.04 --> 675.92
i even know his name his name is joe

674.8 --> 679.04
[Music]

675.92 --> 681.5999999999999
ah not nike thank you very much

679.04 --> 682.48
this is like from the brand underground

681.6 --> 685.839
it's it's

682.48 --> 686.399
it's british actually but it went

685.839 --> 689.839
through

686.399 --> 692.079
some transitions in the production

689.839 --> 694.0790000000001
because i asked and he informed me about

692.079 --> 696.16
it because i keep track of products that

694.079 --> 696.56
i basically want to stick to my entire

696.16 --> 698.959
life

696.56 --> 700.8
you have to keep track of these products

698.959 --> 702.959
in my opinion that's just how i do

700.8 --> 705.5999999999999
things i'm very

702.959 --> 706.56
monotonous with what i use and but then

705.6 --> 709.44
you have to like

706.56 --> 711.04
guarantee its quality because if you

709.44 --> 711.839
don't pay attention you have to turn to

711.04 --> 714.8389999999999
[ __ ]

711.839 --> 717.36
and then you end up with shitty products

714.839 --> 720.24
uh

717.36 --> 720.24
hey good servant

721.68 --> 728.6389999999999
but yeah shoes i kind of do really uh

725.44 --> 731.36
need a new jacket because like now

728.639 --> 733.36
the ladder itself is just starting to

731.36 --> 736.32
disintegrate at certain points and then

733.36 --> 739.279
you can't fix it anymore

736.32 --> 739.6800000000001
it's been going for a while i can still

739.279 --> 742.959
go

739.68 --> 745.4399999999999
on with it but like i give it

742.959 --> 747.68
another year maximum two and then it's

745.44 --> 750.5600000000001
literally gonna just fall apart

747.68 --> 753.68
gonna be ripped in two almost probably

750.56 --> 756.959
or maybe not that bad but

753.68 --> 759.12
right so maintenance oh boring sorry

756.959 --> 762.88
about that

759.12 --> 765.04
uh but yeah do donate to my paypal this

762.88 --> 765.04
is

765.2 --> 768.24
you know if you guys think that it's

767.44 --> 770.72
worth it

768.24 --> 772.0790000000001
it will sure help me it'll help my

770.72 --> 774.1600000000001
confidence in general

772.079 --> 776.399
because just walking around in

774.16 --> 779.4399999999999
completely raggedy stuff doesn't exactly

776.399 --> 779.44
help my confidence

779.92 --> 786.26
although i don't let it bother me too

782.24 --> 789.2
much because i am kind of used to it

786.26 --> 791.36
[Music]

789.2 --> 793.6
but then again i don't want to like

791.36 --> 796.24
break an ankle because suddenly

793.6 --> 797.6
like i misstep because my shoe literally

796.24 --> 799.279
broke into

797.6 --> 801.36
or something like that like the heels

799.279 --> 803.68
gone off

801.36 --> 803.6800000000001
right

808.519 --> 813.2
equestrian what is an equestrian i don't

811.44 --> 816.24
know what that is

813.2 --> 816.639
but yeah my my jacket i i get them from

816.24 --> 819.76
like

816.639 --> 821.12
the black market in the northwest the

819.76 --> 824.72
country there's this

821.12 --> 828.16
specific like bazaar situation

824.72 --> 830.5600000000001
where i get things really cheap and i

828.16 --> 831.4399999999999
yeah i tend to get my jackets over there

830.56 --> 834.0
because they're leather

831.44 --> 835.6
long jackets and anywhere else but there

834.0 --> 839.04
is just

835.6 --> 839.0400000000001
insurmountable prices

839.68 --> 843.8389999999999
it's not worth it to me

845.68 --> 848.0
right

852.16 --> 857.8389999999999
good clothing is essential i agree

862.16 --> 869.4399999999999
right and and then i guess i should

866.16 --> 871.519
sort of break the news

869.44 --> 873.9200000000001
though that's not very close in the

871.519 --> 876.24
future but also thanks to the company i

873.92 --> 880.56
might be able to

876.24 --> 884.0
yeah through their system rent

880.56 --> 887.5189999999999
potentially pretty good cars for

884.0 --> 890.72
prices that are just insanely cheap

887.519 --> 891.44
insanely cheap by my standards like

890.72 --> 893.76
getting

891.44 --> 895.0400000000001
pretty good cars with full insurance and

893.76 --> 897.4399999999999
[ __ ]

895.04 --> 899.5999999999999
for prices that's like not even a

897.44 --> 903.9200000000001
quarter of what i used to pay for

899.6 --> 903.9200000000001
just my insurance for my old car

904.0 --> 910.88
so yeah i might be able to get that and

907.12 --> 910.88
i mean it's already there

911.199 --> 915.04
and that would be for me very great

914.56 --> 916.959
because

915.04 --> 919.12
if i suddenly get a car and i don't have

916.959 --> 920.8
to worry about so much financial issues

919.12 --> 923.12
concerning that

920.8 --> 924.959
then i can also basically bypass the

923.12 --> 926.5600000000001
whole mask situation with public

924.959 --> 928.8
transport

926.56 --> 930.6389999999999
and go places at least in the

928.8 --> 934.079
netherlands

930.639 --> 935.199
easily and who knows where eventually

934.079 --> 939.4399999999999
hey yeah by the way

935.199 --> 943.519
hello tiny wombo and check paypal i will

939.44 --> 944.32
thank you so yeah that's another

943.519 --> 947.68
development

944.32 --> 955.839
yeah this this company is pretty awesome

947.68 --> 955.8389999999999
so far and

957.199 --> 959.4399999999999
ah

961.36 --> 965.04
yes thank you very much for the paypal

963.199 --> 969.8389999999999
donation i appreciate that

965.04 --> 969.8389999999999
that's sweet

976.959 --> 980.7199999999999
thank you tiny wubble

978.86 --> 986.0
[Music]

980.72 --> 986.0
what are texas on private auto insane

989.44 --> 997.839
uh it's it's been a while though i kind

993.12 --> 997.839
of forgot how much

999.36 --> 1003.6
but i always went by the absolute

1001.68 --> 1003.92
minimum and then i think you have to pay

1003.6 --> 1007.36
like

1003.92 --> 1010.399
80 euros a year and that's

1007.36 --> 1014.0
only for like the taxes of

1010.399 --> 1016.56
having it on the road and you have to

1014.0 --> 1018.16
have a certain level of checkup and that

1016.56 --> 1020.0
also costs money

1018.16 --> 1022.0
it depends on the quality of the car

1020.0 --> 1024.24
could be from 40

1022.0 --> 1026.16
it's always like 40 or 80 euros minimum

1024.24 --> 1029.679
and god

1026.16 --> 1031.679
then you got the fuel and then

1029.679 --> 1034.5590000000002
also the insurance and the insurance

1031.679 --> 1036.5590000000002
depends also greatly

1034.559 --> 1038.24
on the situation how old the car is of

1036.559 --> 1040.079
what your reputation is how long you've

1038.24 --> 1041.76
had the insurance now i kind of like

1040.079 --> 1044.959
sort of did it

1041.76 --> 1045.76
a little grabbler trick on voluntary

1044.959 --> 1048.48
base

1045.76 --> 1049.44
because i kind of took over the

1048.48 --> 1052.16
insurance

1049.44 --> 1053.679
length of my mother's insurance i went

1052.16 --> 1056.799
to the same insurance and said

1053.679 --> 1058.5590000000002
can i take over the policy and they went

1056.799 --> 1062.4
okay with it

1058.559 --> 1065.44
so i had like basically a lifetime of

1062.4 --> 1065.44
accident free

1065.6 --> 1070.559
situated because my mother never had an

1067.44 --> 1072.799
accident as a driver

1070.559 --> 1074.3999999999999
so he sort of grabbed and grabbed a

1072.799 --> 1076.72
chick and that way i got it

1074.4 --> 1077.52
kind of cheap but it was still a buck a

1076.72 --> 1080.24
load of money

1077.52 --> 1082.08
like car insurance is just a bucket load

1080.24 --> 1084.96
of money here

1082.08 --> 1084.96
how much was that

1089.36 --> 1092.8799999999999
i don't know it's all a lot of money to

1091.52 --> 1095.52
me it's and yeah

1092.88 --> 1097.2
living on standard welfare it's just

1095.52 --> 1099.52
unattainable

1097.2 --> 1101.039
but with this new situation i could get

1099.52 --> 1105.2
the whole package like

1101.039 --> 1106.799
under 200 euros i think a year

1105.2 --> 1108.32
and then the only thing i have to worry

1106.799 --> 1111.44
about is fuel

1108.32 --> 1111.4399999999998
it's pretty amazing

1118.0 --> 1122.4
i'm sure that there's people with bigger

1120.32 --> 1124.24
cars and that have a lot more money that

1122.4 --> 1126.64
pay a lot more i'm sure of that

1124.24 --> 1126.64
surely

1131.039 --> 1134.24
but i don't know i don't know what i can

1132.88 --> 1137.44
attain with this

1134.24 --> 1139.679
but it it gives me a yeah a cheap option

1137.44 --> 1142.48
to potentially do something thanks

1139.679 --> 1144.799
to being part of the company it's very

1142.48 --> 1144.799
nice

1146.64 --> 1151.76
hey roger hey jam

1155.6 --> 1159.28
equestrian is a horse rider a trainer

1158.0 --> 1165.84
okay

1159.28 --> 1165.84
i didn't know that

1176.559 --> 1184.48
all right oh yeah well

1180.799 --> 1185.2
you know horse riding i remember that

1184.48 --> 1188.48
because

1185.2 --> 1190.0
like horse riding itself is like it

1188.48 --> 1192.4
wears on your pants

1190.0 --> 1193.6
very much it's a lot of friction that

1192.4 --> 1195.919
happens

1193.6 --> 1197.4399999999998
and yeah if you don't have this special

1195.919 --> 1201.1200000000001
type of horse riding

1197.44 --> 1202.96
fabric pants for that

1201.12 --> 1204.1589999999999
then whatever you're gonna wear it's

1202.96 --> 1207.8400000000001
gonna just

1204.159 --> 1207.8400000000001
it's eventually just gonna be destroyed

1208.4 --> 1211.8400000000001
like even if you wear uh was it the the

1211.28 --> 1214.6399999999999
jeans

1211.84 --> 1214.6399999999999
situation

1215.679 --> 1220.48
so yeah they probably know about fabric

1218.96 --> 1224.32
durability

1220.48 --> 1224.32
they have their sources i'm sure of it

1246.84 --> 1249.84
right

1250.32 --> 1253.6
100 per month okay

1254.48 --> 1258.799
right well anyway look just living on

1257.2 --> 1261.76
social welfare

1258.799 --> 1264.1589999999999
having a car is really not attainable in

1261.76 --> 1264.1589999999999
general

1264.24 --> 1270.159
but yeah look as soon as the gta like

1267.919 --> 1272.64
really kind of explode

1270.159 --> 1273.6000000000001
it it all depends on what the stable

1272.64 --> 1277.6000000000001
income is

1273.6 --> 1280.48
from that once i i basically open it up

1277.6 --> 1282.559
and then i don't know if it's if it's

1280.48 --> 1283.28
just a little on the side then i can use

1282.559 --> 1286.3999999999999
it for

1283.28 --> 1287.039
like yeah investments like it did like

1286.4 --> 1289.679
it closed

1287.039 --> 1290.96
like a maintenance but if it's going to

1289.679 --> 1294.72
be even more then

1290.96 --> 1296.88
yeah i will be absolutely forced to

1294.72 --> 1298.88
eventually get off my social welfare

1296.88 --> 1300.5590000000002
situation if it becomes enough for that

1298.88 --> 1303.5200000000002
and i kind of

1300.559 --> 1305.84
always hoped that would happen is just

1303.52 --> 1305.84
that

1305.919 --> 1311.3600000000001
what's it again it's like murphy's law

1309.2 --> 1313.6000000000001
it's just like it seemed like

1311.36 --> 1315.039
too good to be true so i never really

1313.6 --> 1316.8799999999999
expected that it would

1315.039 --> 1318.08
eventually happen that it would be

1316.88 --> 1320.159
postponed forever

1318.08 --> 1321.84
and it's like that the graduation would

1320.159 --> 1325.0390000000002
screw it up

1321.84 --> 1328.32
but might be

1325.039 --> 1331.039
that it actually is attainable

1328.32 --> 1332.6399999999999
and if it will well i don't know it

1331.039 --> 1334.48
would probably mean that there's going

1332.64 --> 1337.1200000000001
to be a lot of changes in my life

1334.48 --> 1337.1200000000001
because of that

1338.4 --> 1342.3200000000002
and i will definitely also inform you

1341.36 --> 1346.3999999999999
guys about it

1342.32 --> 1350.1589999999999
and perhaps yeah see what i'm gonna do

1346.4 --> 1350.159
with that new situation

1350.48 --> 1353.679
it's looking promising at the moment and

1352.4 --> 1356.64
i'm kind of like

1353.679 --> 1356.64
excited about it

1356.88 --> 1361.679
although not there yet still in the face

1359.84 --> 1362.0
where i'm like looking as everything has

1361.679 --> 1364.24
been

1362.0 --> 1365.36
yeah my clothing are disintegrating in

1364.24 --> 1369.28
front of me

1365.36 --> 1370.9599999999998
still on that face but it's like yeah

1369.28 --> 1372.6399999999999
something's coming something's good it's

1370.96 --> 1375.8400000000001
coming for me

1372.64 --> 1375.8400000000001
at least

1376.33 --> 1389.84
[Music]

1378.559 --> 1389.84
yeah and i can finally move on

1390.0 --> 1396.72
but yeah no guarantees just yet

1394.0 --> 1396.72
so i don't know

1397.28 --> 1405.9189999999999
again murphy's law you know

1402.159 --> 1406.24
reinvestment phase hmm that sounds about

1405.919 --> 1409.44
right

1406.24 --> 1412.32
robin stanley i look good in white too

1409.44 --> 1415.679
yeah i agree hannah koala

1412.32 --> 1420.01
i i am actually wearing a white shirt

1415.679 --> 1423.13
but yeah i don't have any white sweaters

1420.01 --> 1423.1299999999999
[Music]

1423.44 --> 1426.96
i don't even wear black shirts anymore i

1426.64 --> 1430.0
do

1426.96 --> 1432.88
still have them but i i think i'm

1430.0 --> 1436.08
changing like that i'm only gonna buy

1432.88 --> 1436.0800000000002
white shirts from now on

1436.72 --> 1440.64
because it feels a lot better it's weird

1439.039 --> 1442.799
how that works

1440.64 --> 1444.48
and in a way it's like i've i've been

1442.799 --> 1447.2
told that before

1444.48 --> 1448.159
it's just that i find it so ridiculous

1447.2 --> 1451.8400000000001
that

1448.159 --> 1454.88
that just that would work when

1451.84 --> 1455.279
yeah my my eyes don't really see it you

1454.88 --> 1459.2
know

1455.279 --> 1473.84
but for some reason it still

1459.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
has an influence it's weird

1473.919 --> 1491.1200000000001
hey martin tolberg

1486.48 --> 1491.1200000000001
in an irish sweater hmm

1496.32 --> 1500.6399999999999
nice well look i'm not gonna be really

1498.88 --> 1501.6000000000001
i'm not gonna be cold this winter all

1500.64 --> 1505.6000000000001
right

1501.6 --> 1505.6
so that's not the problem

1506.559 --> 1511.12
like i got the sweaters these sweaters

1508.559 --> 1511.84
will last for a very long time i trust

1511.12 --> 1514.799
that i got

1511.84 --> 1515.36
i got two of these they're they're going

1514.799 --> 1518.6399999999999
to last

1515.36 --> 1518.9599999999998
pretty long i i see that i can at least

1518.64 --> 1529.8400000000001
do

1518.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
another five years no problem with them

1540.64 --> 1559.3600000000001
he's still earth journey hello

1556.64 --> 1560.88
ah okay you're on a smoke break martin

1559.36 --> 1566.4799999999998
cool

1560.88 --> 1566.48
thanks for joining yeah uh

1566.88 --> 1569.919
i would love to get into more technical

1569.12 --> 1572.3999999999999
things

1569.919 --> 1572.4
as well

1577.52 --> 1580.8799999999999
but yeah it's also just very appealing

1579.919 --> 1585.679
to to look

1580.88 --> 1588.0
at at that you know

1585.679 --> 1591.2
isn't it it's just this is like a

1588.0 --> 1591.2
painting it's amazing

1592.64 --> 1599.8400000000001
wouldn't you say

1610.4 --> 1613.499
[Music]

1614.159 --> 1618.88
so yeah i don't know with the sun and

1616.0 --> 1620.72
the colors and

1618.88 --> 1622.3200000000002
and it's not as windy too you know

1620.72 --> 1624.559
there's a little breeze but

1622.32 --> 1626.0
yeah compared to before we're up there

1624.559 --> 1628.3999999999999
like you could literally see

1626.0 --> 1629.6
the clouds rushing compared to the back

1628.4 --> 1631.2
to the trees and everything

1629.6 --> 1634.32
that's not happening now they're just

1631.2 --> 1637.279
kind of sitting there the clouds

1634.32 --> 1638.0
and it just gives this much more

1637.279 --> 1641.2
peaceful

1638.0 --> 1642.799
impression so it's just very beautiful

1641.2 --> 1645.919
to kind of look and stare at

1642.799 --> 1646.32
and and not really think about a lot of

1645.919 --> 1649.8400000000001
things

1646.32 --> 1652.8799999999999
it's really very calm calming soothing

1649.84 --> 1654.72
i like it it's really nice compared to

1652.88 --> 1669.8400000000001
yesterday because when everything was

1654.72 --> 1669.84
just constantly restless and [ __ ] and

1674.64 --> 1677.679
yeah i'm gonna be doing newspaper rounds

1676.72 --> 1680.24
too

1677.679 --> 1682.0
this time i will definitely do it and

1680.24 --> 1684.3990000000001
just very nice to have this type

1682.0 --> 1687.039
of weather instead of like the the

1684.399 --> 1690.08
terrible weather last week

1687.039 --> 1692.799
that made me not do it because

1690.08 --> 1694.799
all the papers would just get wet and

1692.799 --> 1697.84
messy

1694.799 --> 1711.84
now that's not gonna happen this evening

1697.84 --> 1711.84
i'm confident of that

1714.32 --> 1718.8799999999999
right so any developments

1719.6 --> 1725.84
i think specifically interesting going

1722.84 --> 1725.84
on

1728.72 --> 1733.52
oh i see david weiss just uploaded a

1731.279 --> 1736.08
video how to fake a rocket launch on

1733.52 --> 1736.08
flat earth

1736.84 --> 1739.84
okay

1760.48 --> 1763.3600000000001
all right uh

1763.52 --> 1766.799
yeah in my recom you youtube

1780.88 --> 1784.3990000000001
it would be the energy is certainly good

1783.76 --> 1786.399
for that

1784.399 --> 1789.1999999999998
just thinking about okay i could

1786.399 --> 1792.4799999999998
potentially for example

1789.2 --> 1796.24
if i had something to really do with it

1792.48 --> 1798.08
a plan i could work on like d and d

1796.24 --> 1801.279
maps and [ __ ] really well now

1798.08 --> 1801.279
unfortunately yeah it's

1802.0 --> 1809.84
it's not happening i'm a little sad

1805.44 --> 1809.8400000000001
about that

1820.48 --> 1825.76
although i guess yeah i'm using my

1822.72 --> 1829.039
creative energy to kind of

1825.76 --> 1832.64
construct my own future i'm alwa

1829.039 --> 1836.08
yeah i got the impression almost i was

1832.64 --> 1837.679
it sounds so weird to translate that out

1836.08 --> 1840.6399999999999
like like i was communicating with

1837.679 --> 1845.1200000000001
myself on the other side

1840.64 --> 1848.3990000000001
being very angry at it as usual

1845.12 --> 1851.84
because it is like it feels maybe

1848.399 --> 1854.0
mistakenly like it's like the inferior

1851.84 --> 1856.1589999999999
character of myself in the past that i'm

1854.0 --> 1859.6
dealing with

1856.159 --> 1860.96
and just because one of the weirdest

1859.6 --> 1863.279
things that

1860.96 --> 1864.72
i yeah that i explain even about that

1863.279 --> 1866.88
whole thing is that

1864.72 --> 1869.919
when i went through that everything was

1866.88 --> 1873.44
too much for me because i could not

1869.919 --> 1876.96
evolve i could not grow beyond

1873.44 --> 1879.2
the character that i was at that time

1876.96 --> 1881.279
so i could like mechanically learn

1879.2 --> 1884.96
things but i could not

1881.279 --> 1885.36
learn from it and then to experience

1884.96 --> 1888.559
just

1885.36 --> 1891.12
vast and vast amount of

1888.559 --> 1892.08
information and like into the future

1891.12 --> 1894.8799999999999
even

1892.08 --> 1896.24
it's all too much and the only thing

1894.88 --> 1898.159
that i could eventually

1896.24 --> 1900.32
keep out of it is kind of the feelings

1898.159 --> 1902.0800000000002
but yeah i was so stuck up and even

1900.32 --> 1904.08
caught up on my own feelings and the

1902.08 --> 1906.0
realization that i wasn't learning and

1904.08 --> 1908.8799999999999
that i was afraid that maybe in real

1906.0 --> 1909.36
life i wasn't learning either that it

1908.88 --> 1913.8400000000001
was

1909.36 --> 1917.12
all getting messed up and now

1913.84 --> 1919.4399999999998
that i realize that consciously again

1917.12 --> 1920.559
i'm trying to correct it sounds really

1919.44 --> 1923.6000000000001
magical right

1920.559 --> 1926.6399999999999
i know it sounds really weird it sounds

1923.6 --> 1926.6399999999999
really weird to me too

1927.279 --> 1934.08
but i'm just i'm just trying

1930.559 --> 1938.8799999999999
i'm just trying to tap into it and and

1934.08 --> 1942.559
try to steer it to get

1938.88 --> 1946.0800000000002
myself from that trip out of

1942.559 --> 1949.519
this contortion back into just like yeah

1946.08 --> 1952.8799999999999
can you please go back to

1949.519 --> 1956.159
working on my life again and

1952.88 --> 1959.0390000000002
setting out things for me that

1956.159 --> 1960.96
that are just good and that are meant to

1959.039 --> 1964.48
be

1960.96 --> 1969.6000000000001
and not some freaky distraction

1964.48 --> 1969.6
that i was caught up in with back then

1970.0 --> 1975.6
so sound yeah it sounds surreal it is

1974.24 --> 1978.24
kind of surreal

1975.6 --> 1978.799
i don't even know if it works but i hope

1978.24 --> 1983.039
to

1978.799 --> 1986.48
feel if it does on the long run

1983.039 --> 1988.32
and hey even earlier when i wasn't

1986.48 --> 1990.08
kind of actively doing this sort of

1988.32 --> 1993.36
thing from more confident

1990.08 --> 1994.799
standpoint as of where i am now i would

1993.36 --> 1996.7199999999998
even explain

1994.799 --> 1998.6399999999999
like i had the feeling there was all

1996.72 --> 2001.679
kinds of things happening

1998.64 --> 2001.679
in that experience

2001.84 --> 2006.48
and that i that maybe i did get control

2004.799 --> 2010.08
of it at some point well

2006.48 --> 2010.08
that this may be that

2010.64 --> 2013.76
but even though that i would get control

2013.279 --> 2017.44
of it

2013.76 --> 2021.679
in that time period the spirit that was

2017.44 --> 2025.279
getting control of that i was back then

2021.679 --> 2027.8400000000001
still would not evolve from it would not

2025.279 --> 2029.679
find the confidence that i would be

2027.84 --> 2032.799
getting right now

2029.679 --> 2038.0
because i back then do

2032.799 --> 2038.0
had did not have it available see

2038.08 --> 2044.72
weird time entanglement stuff man it's

2041.84 --> 2048.7999999999997
it's absolutely fascinating to me in

2044.72 --> 2051.28
ways but i try not to obsess over it

2048.8 --> 2054.32
but i i do just get these moments where

2051.28 --> 2054.32
i'm dealing with it

2054.399 --> 2058.3199999999997
i don't know maybe you guys think i'm

2056.32 --> 2060.48
all crazy now

2058.32 --> 2064.079
i know certain types of ballers will

2060.48 --> 2066.48
definitely try to use this to basically

2064.079 --> 2067.9190000000003
reaffirm their belief that flat earthers

2066.48 --> 2069.76
must be crazy

2067.919 --> 2071.839
and i know that there's going to be very

2069.76 --> 2072.3990000000003
a little other flat earthers out there

2071.839 --> 2076.399
that are

2072.399 --> 2078.56
even going to attempt to try to engage

2076.399 --> 2082.6389999999997
with surreal things of their life

2078.56 --> 2084.56
this open who the hell's doing that

2082.639 --> 2087.04
there might be people trying to do it

2084.56 --> 2089.839
and yeah they'll probably get lost and

2087.04 --> 2089.839
just

2089.919 --> 2095.52
go into free-for-all wherever direction

2093.28 --> 2098.2400000000002
i'm not trying to do that no no no i'm

2095.52 --> 2101.68
trying to tame the surreal

2098.24 --> 2103.839
of myself and i got a plan

2101.68 --> 2104.72
and i even have memories how it worked

2103.839 --> 2107.599
and how

2104.72 --> 2108.3999999999996
i was so disappointed that i couldn't

2107.599 --> 2111.92
pull it

2108.4 --> 2114.56
with me into the past

2111.92 --> 2116.2400000000002
because that is really what i eventually

2114.56 --> 2119.839
wanted in the whole thing i

2116.24 --> 2122.0789999999997
wanted to be here i didn't want to go

2119.839 --> 2125.599
through all that [ __ ]

2122.079 --> 2128.6400000000003
i wanted to be strong

2125.599 --> 2129.2000000000003
already then and i couldn't and i

2128.64 --> 2131.92
couldn't

2129.2 --> 2133.9199999999996
accept that i couldn't and that is

2131.92 --> 2138.16
really kind of what

2133.92 --> 2138.16
created this weird situation

2139.92 --> 2145.839
can anybody still follow me with that

2151.92 --> 2159.839
hello jason

2164.16 --> 2171.5989999999997
yeah okay

2168.48 --> 2174.16
yeah don't fist bump me dude you know

2171.599 --> 2174.1600000000003
your band

2177.119 --> 2180.6400000000003
just because i've been in general

2178.8 --> 2181.6800000000003
leading to people doesn't mean that i

2180.64 --> 2184.7999999999997
will be

2181.68 --> 2186.3999999999996
that to you as well but

2184.8 --> 2188.0
yeah because i don't like you there's

2186.4 --> 2190.079
nothing going to happen ever that will

2188.0 --> 2193.119
make me like you

2190.079 --> 2195.2000000000003
or won't make me want to be more

2193.119 --> 2196.88
tolerant towards you just so you know

2195.2 --> 2198.3199999999997
but hey if you want to hang around here

2196.88 --> 2200.88
that's fine

2198.32 --> 2203.44
but you know the rules you know your

2200.88 --> 2206.88
rules my rules for you

2203.44 --> 2209.359
and they still stand so that's fine

2206.88 --> 2215.839
you want to hang around in my chat

2209.359 --> 2215.839
that's okay

2226.839 --> 2229.839
ah

2234.96 --> 2243.839
right okay i've got 15 more minutes sort

2240.839 --> 2243.839
of

2250.4 --> 2260.0
okay kevin horizons

2256.48 --> 2263.2
wait with you

2260.0 --> 2263.68
sir a convoluted concept but a very

2263.2 --> 2267.68
valid

2263.68 --> 2269.52
very valid one exactly

2267.68 --> 2272.96
are you addressing me or somebody else

2269.52 --> 2272.96
here in chat kevin horizons

2277.359 --> 2282.7999999999997
the full blue moon in south america

2280.48 --> 2282.8
what

2283.599 --> 2287.52
hey manuel aviles

2289.839 --> 2296.4
addressing me about what i was saying

2293.28 --> 2298.7200000000003
oh you mean the yeah

2296.4 --> 2300.96
the the mega convoluted extra

2298.72 --> 2303.2
dimensional entanglement

2300.96 --> 2304.56
situation yeah yeah it can get more

2303.2 --> 2306.7999999999997
convoluted than that

2304.56 --> 2308.0789999999997
but it is fascinating though how much

2306.8 --> 2309.92
i've by now

2308.079 --> 2313.8390000000004
started to realize about what it really

2309.92 --> 2313.839
was and what really happened

2319.44 --> 2328.56
and how foolish it also was

2324.24 --> 2332.0
how foolish it was to just

2328.56 --> 2335.2
want something now that you know

2332.0 --> 2337.52
you will get and then just that sheer

2335.2 --> 2340.48
impatience basically almost wrecking

2337.52 --> 2344.32
yourself but within patience

2340.48 --> 2346.96
just can you imagine like impatience

2344.32 --> 2348.7200000000003
impatience is a big problem with my

2346.96 --> 2352.16
character

2348.72 --> 2354.24
and i've learned to deal a lot with it

2352.16 --> 2356.96
up to levels that i can actually be a

2354.24 --> 2361.2799999999997
halfway tolerable person

2356.96 --> 2365.28
this is but deep down

2361.28 --> 2368.6400000000003
i'm i'm pretty intolerant universally

2365.28 --> 2371.76
but i've just then learned

2368.64 --> 2372.96
what it is to tolerate and the potential

2371.76 --> 2375.28
advantages on it

2372.96 --> 2376.8
of it but also that the tension does

2375.28 --> 2377.28
keep building and you have to deal with

2376.8 --> 2380.4
it

2377.28 --> 2383.28
and it has made me an isolationist

2380.4 --> 2385.6800000000003
to cope with it to kind of isolate

2383.28 --> 2386.96
myself i go to a party it's nice and fun

2385.68 --> 2391.52
and then after a while i

2386.96 --> 2394.079
have to step away and just be on my own

2391.52 --> 2394.079
and come

2394.56 --> 2398.56
and that's the way that i deal with that

2398.88 --> 2406.53
what no what is it good servant

2402.96 --> 2406.53
[Music]

2408.72 --> 2414.48
cue a drone hovering over one hour video

2411.52 --> 2416.16
record start above 15 degrees per hour

2414.48 --> 2417.839
in the same video the earth below has

2416.16 --> 2418.8799999999997
not moved a thousand miles how is that

2417.839 --> 2421.92
possible

2418.88 --> 2424.96
ah well

2421.92 --> 2428.16
it is possible according to the ballers

2424.96 --> 2430.079
because they believe that the earth's

2428.16 --> 2431.68
atmosphere moves in lockstep

2430.079 --> 2433.599
with the rotation of the earth and that

2431.68 --> 2436.16
is why you can only see

2433.599 --> 2438.4
the stars moving because they are not in

2436.16 --> 2441.68
the same reference frame

2438.4 --> 2443.599
and everything else is but yeah in

2441.68 --> 2444.8799999999997
reality it's the other way around it's

2443.599 --> 2447.3590000000004
the stars that

2444.88 --> 2449.92
just appear to angularly move in

2447.359 --> 2453.359
relation to the observer

2449.92 --> 2456.56
and the rest of the earth does not also

2453.359 --> 2460.0789999999997
i re

2456.56 --> 2462.48
realized that air indeed

2460.079 --> 2464.0
is euclidean in nature and that it

2462.48 --> 2467.119
doesn't get

2464.0 --> 2470.8
dragged unlike all gases

2467.119 --> 2474.56
unlike liquids and solids

2470.8 --> 2476.48
liquids and solids have momentum

2474.56 --> 2478.24
applied to them gas does not

2476.48 --> 2480.96
interestingly enough there's only

2478.24 --> 2481.68
pressure mechanics only pressure

2480.96 --> 2484.7200000000003
mechanics

2481.68 --> 2488.56
is is what gases deal with

2484.72 --> 2490.7999999999997
in order for them to move not momentum

2488.56 --> 2492.48
and that really is that's something that

2490.8 --> 2496.079
was a little realization that i had

2492.48 --> 2496.079
yesterday very specific one

2496.88 --> 2500.88
like to really define why it is

2499.92 --> 2504.7200000000003
different

2500.88 --> 2507.6800000000003
in the road rotationary situations

2504.72 --> 2510.64
it's because air does not have drag it

2507.68 --> 2513.68
has frictions it deals with pressure

2510.64 --> 2517.44
and pressure only but it doesn't

2513.68 --> 2520.48
receive momentum

2517.44 --> 2520.88
isn't that just interesting so the idea

2520.48 --> 2523.92
of

2520.88 --> 2525.76
air moving in lockstep is

2523.92 --> 2528.2400000000002
per definition an impossibility and

2525.76 --> 2530.1600000000003
probably a demonstrable

2528.24 --> 2531.9199999999996
impossible it could be demonstrated to

2530.16 --> 2534.7999999999997
be impossible with

2531.92 --> 2535.52
specific centrifuge setups then you put

2534.8 --> 2537.52
all kinds of

2535.52 --> 2539.68
like you take a giant ring that's going

2537.52 --> 2541.7599999999998
to spin

2539.68 --> 2543.2
whatever in their cameras detectors

2541.76 --> 2546.48
temperatures all

2543.2 --> 2548.24
pressure things things to just be

2546.48 --> 2549.76
exactly sure what's going on there you

2548.24 --> 2550.56
put some sand in there you put some

2549.76 --> 2553.5200000000004
water in there

2550.56 --> 2555.68
and you put gases in there and then you

2553.52 --> 2557.359
start rotating the whole thing

2555.68 --> 2559.44
now of course centripetal forces will

2557.359 --> 2561.92
apply and then you can just see

2559.44 --> 2563.76
like yeah yeah eventually the liquids

2561.92 --> 2566.4
will start to move in lockstep with the

2563.76 --> 2569.28
rotation and of course the sands

2566.4 --> 2569.6800000000003
it absolutely will do that guess what

2569.28 --> 2572.88
that

2569.68 --> 2576.0789999999997
air is going to keep on

2572.88 --> 2579.04
flowing at least slower

2576.079 --> 2579.76
and maybe parts will be completely still

2579.04 --> 2582.4
it will

2579.76 --> 2584.6400000000003
never reach a point no matter how long

2582.4 --> 2587.92
you spin that thing this is my

2584.64 --> 2590.72
prediction of this setup there will be

2587.92 --> 2594.319
no point where the gas will eventually

2590.72 --> 2597.2799999999997
move in perfect lock step just like the

2594.319 --> 2598.96
water and the sand it never will that is

2597.28 --> 2603.2000000000003
my prediction and that would

2598.96 --> 2605.599
absolutely definitively dispel the myth

2603.2 --> 2609.359
that air could move in lockstep with the

2605.599 --> 2609.3590000000004
road rotating anything

2610.24 --> 2617.04
so yeah that was

2613.28 --> 2617.0400000000004
a good realization yesterday

2617.76 --> 2623.599
i think i did mention that or

2620.96 --> 2627.359
well not i didn't lay it out fully i

2623.599 --> 2627.3590000000004
think i just asked a question about it

2627.44 --> 2630.88
but i'm putting it down right here so

2629.2 --> 2634.72
this is a realization

2630.88 --> 2638.88
a prediction i have to really

2634.72 --> 2641.839
explain why it's not possible because of

2638.88 --> 2641.839
yeah the lack of

2645.319 --> 2649.839
susceptibility to momentum

2653.92 --> 2660.319
so gases are not susceptible to momentum

2658.48 --> 2662.0
and therefore they cannot move in

2660.319 --> 2666.079
lockstep rotation with

2662.0 --> 2670.079
anything see very

2666.079 --> 2672.2400000000002
one two sentences and it's very very

2670.079 --> 2677.2000000000003
clear

2672.24 --> 2680.4799999999996
so remember that gases

2677.2 --> 2683.1189999999997
are not susceptible to momentum

2680.48 --> 2684.0
so they can never move in lockstep

2683.119 --> 2687.04
rotation

2684.0 --> 2687.04
with anything

2687.839 --> 2695.92
because the only thing that moves gases

2691.119 --> 2695.92
is pressure differential see

2697.68 --> 2702.16
so it can be made to move if the

2699.92 --> 2704.16
pressure division changes

2702.16 --> 2705.359
even if something presses against it

2704.16 --> 2708.3999999999996
because something else

2705.359 --> 2710.7999999999997
might be susceptible to momentum and

2708.4 --> 2711.92
rotate and then it will push against

2710.8 --> 2714.4
that air

2711.92 --> 2716.96
so there will be some drag maybe but

2714.4 --> 2720.319
there will be no momentum

2716.96 --> 2722.0
so it will never eventually move in full

2720.319 --> 2723.92
lockstep with the whole thing

2722.0 --> 2725.76
see and that is really kind of the claim

2723.92 --> 2728.16
that the ballers hang on to to explain

2725.76 --> 2731.0400000000004
the lack of coriolis deviation

2728.16 --> 2732.96
here on earth and then it gets all

2731.04 --> 2735.359
convoluted to hell

2732.96 --> 2735.359
of course

2741.68 --> 2760.16
i'm gonna call the hangout this it's

2744.079 --> 2765.8390000000004
good to title i hang out again

2760.16 --> 2765.839
yeah i hope i spelled it right

2769.44 --> 2789.839
yeah i did huh

2774.88 --> 2793.599
all right

2789.839 --> 2796.4
right it is a lot of fun though you know

2793.599 --> 2797.44
to go through the whole thing and just

2796.4 --> 2800.2400000000002
one by one

2797.44 --> 2802.48
figure out every single impossibility

2800.24 --> 2805.9199999999996
about every step of their claims it is

2802.48 --> 2805.92
it is quite fascinating

2806.079 --> 2811.92
really to discover how much

2809.28 --> 2813.3590000000004
that literally everything they do is

2811.92 --> 2816.8
based on false

2813.359 --> 2818.88
assumptions and false misinterpretations

2816.8 --> 2822.4
of physics and just

2818.88 --> 2824.319
it's pretty astounding how deep it runs

2822.4 --> 2826.2400000000002
and that it can that it can on the

2824.319 --> 2828.72
surface still seem to work

2826.24 --> 2830.319
it's pretty astounding how much the

2828.72 --> 2834.0789999999997
ignorance plays a part

2830.319 --> 2845.04
in the holes in it seeming to work

2834.079 --> 2847.76
it's pretty amazing

2845.04 --> 2850.079
okay you got buzz last night no no doubt

2847.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
probably a lot of people

2850.079 --> 2859.8390000000004
with all the election tensions

2865.76 --> 2871.92
right yeah pugsley lovejoy the assumed

2869.359 --> 2873.2799999999997
force of gravity which it officially

2871.92 --> 2874.88
isn't it's just a bunch of bending of

2873.28 --> 2877.8390000000004
space-time

2874.88 --> 2879.839
yeah it's it's within the spectrum of

2877.839 --> 2881.04
the consideration of the spectrum of

2879.839 --> 2883.68
forces

2881.04 --> 2886.5589999999997
it's the we they even say the weakest

2883.68 --> 2888.16
force it's like a weak force the weakest

2886.559 --> 2890.4
of the main forces

2888.16 --> 2893.2
really if you even consider it as a

2890.4 --> 2897.04
force so how silly is that

2893.2 --> 2899.2799999999997
it's like the yeah the the weak

2897.04 --> 2902.8
the weakest force and it can't do

2899.28 --> 2906.559
anything so that's why they don't

2902.8 --> 2908.6400000000003
use it as a force to do things

2906.559 --> 2910.8
because it is too weak that's probably

2908.64 --> 2913.839
also a mechanical reason why they did

2910.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
step into complete conceptual medium

2913.839 --> 2917.599
because they early on realized like yeah

2915.839 --> 2918.0789999999997
that force is not going to be strong

2917.599 --> 2922.0
enough

2918.079 --> 2923.2000000000003
to really do what people would typically

2922.0 --> 2926.0
imagine it would do

2923.2 --> 2928.3999999999996
based on the stories we give them that

2926.0 --> 2931.839
oh look gravity things fall down right

2928.4 --> 2935.839
and the gas is also pulled in well

2931.839 --> 2939.04
it works only because of the ignorance

2935.839 --> 2940.839
that people might have about that gases

2939.04 --> 2943.92
could

2940.839 --> 2945.839
stick to a ball like that

2943.92 --> 2947.839
because of gravity because they wouldn't

2945.839 --> 2949.68
know that's the only way it could work

2947.839 --> 2950.16
because if you get into the mechanics of

2949.68 --> 2952.24
it

2950.16 --> 2953.359
then it all goes to [ __ ] they realize

2952.24 --> 2956.0
that and that's why

2953.359 --> 2958.4
they gave a default step away option

2956.0 --> 2960.0
into conceptual medium as an explanation

2958.4 --> 2962.2400000000002
of how that could happen

2960.0 --> 2964.72
basically not explaining how it could

2962.24 --> 2966.7999999999997
happen but giving you an alternative

2964.72 --> 2967.7599999999998
imagination of how it could happen that

2966.8 --> 2970.96
could not be

2967.76 --> 2971.5200000000004
tied in to physical reality because it's

2970.96 --> 2974.88
so

2971.52 --> 2976.72
difficult you have to be really smart to

2974.88 --> 2978.319
understand that

2976.72 --> 2980.0
but when you are smart enough to

2978.319 --> 2982.16
understand that and you will get to that

2980.0 --> 2985.44
point you will realize

2982.16 --> 2986.3999999999996
that it's impossible because of what it

2985.44 --> 2988.48
really is

2986.4 --> 2991.04
but you have to be smart enough to get

2988.48 --> 2993.839
that to understand that

2991.04 --> 2995.119
and then yeah what are you gonna do with

2993.839 --> 2997.52
that

2995.119 --> 2998.6400000000003
right so anyway i'm gonna round out the

2997.52 --> 3001.04
show

2998.64 --> 3002.7999999999997
thanks everyone for coming if you like

3023.52 --> 3028.16
super chat or the

3024.48 --> 3030.4
uh paypal donation and yeah please

3028.16 --> 3032.64
everybody keep it coming i really need

3030.4 --> 3036.0
it at this point i'm

3032.64 --> 3040.4
in a bit of a vacuum moment right now

3036.0 --> 3042.8
financially i'll survive but yeah

3040.4 --> 3045.52
the whole earlier part of the hangout

3042.8 --> 3047.92
that's really referring to pretty much

3045.52 --> 3048.88
the next year because i'm still at the

3047.92 --> 3052.64
end of like

3048.88 --> 3055.6800000000003
the the financially dry period

3052.64 --> 3057.5989999999997
so would designate it anyway

3055.68 --> 3059.839
uh i'll be back tomorrow with flat earth

3057.599 --> 3061.3590000000004
early bird number 711 i'm

3059.839 --> 3063.839
going to join the flat earth debates

3061.359 --> 3066.96
which has already started up

3063.839 --> 3069.44
uh hashtag mifa

3066.96 --> 3070.2400000000002
indeed over mukul and until the next

3069.44 --> 3083.59
video

3070.24 --> 3103.8199999999997
keep it flat

3083.59 --> 3103.82
[Music]

3112.8 --> 3114.88
you
