56.35 --> 62.11
normally 2 p.m. after damn time

59.37 --> 66.14999999999999
sometimes it's a little bit earlier like

62.11 --> 74.19
today because I was sick of waiting so

66.15 --> 74.19
today the weather is it's not bad it's

74.369 --> 79.78
it looks kind of grayish now but just

77.86 --> 82.57
yet a moment I was smoking on the roof

79.78 --> 87.39
there and suddenly the Sun broke through

82.57 --> 92.53
and was really warm and like pretty

87.39 --> 95.38
serious thick Sun very nice for a moment

92.53 --> 99.16
so I don't know it's still nice and

95.38 --> 101.44
spring and lots of clouds a little bit

99.16 --> 104.95
of rain here and there but not around

101.44 --> 112.45
here so far so how are you guys and gals

104.95 --> 119.709
all doing guys so far so Steve x-23 20 I

112.45 --> 124.38
mean a gem that's it oh right over moco

119.709 --> 131.92000000000002
hello welcome right so did you guys see

124.38 --> 134.319
a Randy's life Beach footage just just

131.92 --> 139.54
before this pretty much started right

134.319 --> 144.31
after was really amazing and he was

139.54 --> 149.01999999999998
hilarious eel I've filmed his p900 live

144.31 --> 151.15
streamed his p900 filming ships moving

149.02 --> 154.959
into the Mirage in zone or beyond the

151.15 --> 156.34
optical slanter and yeah I was it's

154.959 --> 157.98
always cool to see that kind of thing

156.34 --> 160.63
live streamed

157.98 --> 162.88
although yeah was kind of hard for him

160.63 --> 164.26999999999998
to aim the the live streaming camera

162.88 --> 167.18
sometimes so it would be point

164.27 --> 170.51000000000002
hedid telling about what he was seeing

167.18 --> 173.6
on the p900 but pointing slightly beside

170.51 --> 175.37
it so but yeah that happens it was cool

173.6 --> 178.91
stream so take a look if you haven't

175.37 --> 189.01
already after this I ran T flat earth

178.91 --> 189.01
great channel great footage right so

189.4 --> 197.24
what I've been doing yesterday I went

194.36 --> 202.94000000000003
back to earth bettan went to bed early

197.24 --> 204.89000000000001
again that was good huh kind of skipped

202.94 --> 210.56
dinner in the process weirdly enough but

204.89 --> 212.48
I had like a ultimate bone broth to

210.56 --> 220.85
shake before that and it's as good as

212.48 --> 226.07
amelong was so right yeah but I'm

220.85 --> 229.43
watching more Netflix God holy [ __ ] like

226.07 --> 237.5
that Outlander series holy crap

229.43 --> 240.98000000000002
they get really really messed up it it's

237.5 --> 243.38
quite an extreme context to place it in

240.98 --> 246.47
as I basically started watching in the

243.38 --> 248.93
third season had no idea that any of

246.47 --> 253.52
this had happened to this scale but they

248.93 --> 261.56
get like pretty graphic holy [ __ ]

253.52 --> 264.32
like torture and rape porn and yeah

261.56 --> 266.51
almost up to Game of Thrones levels and

264.32 --> 270.38
you even get to see naked dicks and no

266.51 --> 274.73
that's like holy [ __ ] but that was

270.38 --> 275.56
pretty much pretty messed up to be to

274.73 --> 281.21000000000004
put it lightly

275.56 --> 283.22
huh and I you know what I've been

281.21 --> 285.83
watching this series now for a while

283.22 --> 288.8
but I'm starting to notice certain

285.83 --> 294.10999999999996
patterns in it and it's kind of getting

288.8 --> 296.93
annoying I am kind of losing my sympathy

294.11 --> 297.55
for the main female character because

296.93 --> 301.87
she can

297.55 --> 306.49
like really really annoying sometimes

301.87 --> 308.71
like it's it's of course part of the

306.49 --> 310.63
plot device she's basically did the

308.71 --> 312.94
princess that gets everyone in trouble

310.63 --> 314.56
and then the arrow has to rescue her

312.94 --> 316.03
kind of thing although sometimes the

314.56 --> 320.89
roles are turned around it's interesting

316.03 --> 323.28999999999996
and dynamic as a story but good it's

320.89 --> 326.56
like she's basically a social justice

323.29 --> 331.87
warrior champion kind of thing every

326.56 --> 339.46
single time and like it gets really

331.87 --> 344.35
annoying like too much anyway enough

339.46 --> 347.73999999999995
about that series and yeah just I don't

344.35 --> 350.08000000000004
know it it didn't quite turn out what I

347.74 --> 352.96000000000004
thought it was gonna be on the surface

350.08 --> 356.71
it is quite amazing and the acting is

352.96 --> 359.77
really good but it still kind of messed

356.71 --> 362.40999999999997
up but yeah what's good series now is

359.77 --> 365.16999999999996
not messed up in some kind of way you

362.41 --> 369.75
know it's pretty tough but it is a

365.17 --> 374.38
typical pattern that is like too far

369.75 --> 380.02
things and again social justice warrior

374.38 --> 382.87
pressure this although obviously not

380.02 --> 385.35999999999996
unreasonable is it was very convenient

382.87 --> 389.76
for that to do that like take somebody

385.36 --> 395.22
from the future or from our past but and

389.76 --> 395.21999999999997
then put them in just around

396.18 --> 401.86
pre-renaissance time and then yeah still

399.73 --> 403.78000000000003
a lot of the old shits go gone so yeah

401.86 --> 405.49
you know that's the moment to step in

403.78 --> 408.28
for the social justice where you say oh

405.49 --> 412.06
this is ridiculous this is unfair

408.28 --> 417.45
prosecution or persecution or yeah it's

412.06 --> 422.3
kind of okay we get it but it's

417.45 --> 422.3
I don't know

423.92 --> 429.2
maybe I should slow down on watching

426.08 --> 435.16999999999996
that series it's just a bit too much

429.2 --> 437.32
sometimes that's a good one AGM slowly

435.17 --> 442.54
losing sympathy for the devil as well

437.32 --> 445.54
alright yeah cuz it kind of is in there

442.54 --> 445.54
still

450.809 --> 457.96000000000004
and also like the main character is like

454.96 --> 461.62
this subbu I'm atheist also so she's

457.96 --> 466.15
just a total liberal and literally first

461.62 --> 468.599
wave feminist supposedly literally that

466.15 --> 468.599
and

475.87 --> 479.889
my Effendi like there's a lot of

477.82 --> 482.169
Christianity going on a lot of conflict

479.889 --> 488.76
at that and no Christians back then were

482.169 --> 499.97999999999996
so persecuting and wild supposedly I

488.76 --> 499.98
don't know it just it plays into so many

501.6 --> 507.34000000000003
it plays it into the liberal narrative a

504.76 --> 510.61
lot for people that just want it to see

507.34 --> 513.3389999999999
that way it feeds them and that I know

510.61 --> 517.0600000000001
this is kind of bad about it that's what

513.339 --> 523.229
makes me kind of dislike it because it

517.06 --> 523.2289999999999
doesn't seem fair like

523.789 --> 532.0
it's very complicated how these things

526.85 --> 532.0
are made basically the yeah really

540.9 --> 546.65
okay anyway let's see what you guys are

544.23 --> 546.65
talking about

552.87 --> 562.74
oh by the way I am open for guests just

557.34 --> 567.15
not in chat openly I've put it out in

562.74 --> 569.28
the early bird chat

567.15 --> 572.09
I made put out the link also in the

569.28 --> 572.0899999999999
master bee chat

583.85 --> 589.029
all right yeah

585.84 --> 589.029
[Music]

594.3 --> 599.31
[Music]

595.7 --> 605.6700000000001
um sorry I'm getting distracted by

599.31 --> 607.1099999999999
myself but Alex Jones yesterday also

605.67 --> 610.17
I've been also watching him a little

607.11 --> 612.9300000000001
between just listening merci

610.17 --> 615.15
and he made a couple of good points or

612.93 --> 617.79
rather like he got back to the old thing

615.15 --> 620.67
like Oh Satanists and what are they

617.79 --> 627.51
really and where are they

620.67 --> 631.8299999999999
and he really made a good point he he

627.51 --> 634.35
kind of opened up his his sight on it

631.83 --> 637.07
really well in order for me to kind of

634.35 --> 639.51
feel him out as he was telling it I

637.07 --> 641.0
really got what he was saying and I

639.51 --> 645.06
think he's right

641.0 --> 648.93
that like the Satanist is reverse

645.06 --> 649.7399999999999
twirlers with their lust for for

648.93 --> 651.75
corruption

649.74 --> 654.54
they have lust for corruption basically

651.75 --> 656.97
that they are they have somehow

654.54 --> 661.26
maneuvered themselves in these places of

656.97 --> 669.33
power and they're they're rampant

661.26 --> 673.35
currently the media and moviemaking and

669.33 --> 677.07
in politics and that's really what they

673.35 --> 681.38
are whether they even there's like the

677.07 --> 685.7700000000001
the ones that are just openly vile and

681.38 --> 687.87
really kind of like try to purchase it

685.77 --> 689.8199999999999
it's not it's vile signaling it's not

687.87 --> 693.48
even virtuous it's vile signaling just

689.82 --> 695.61
showing that they really really don't

693.48 --> 699.0
give a [ __ ] about the morality aspect of

695.61 --> 701.28
it it's vile signaling some of them are

699.0 --> 704.24
like that and others are more the virtue

701.28 --> 707.67
signalers and they're really either just

704.24 --> 709.6800000000001
they've literally choke themselves in

707.67 --> 715.8199999999999
the delusion and just go with the power

709.68 --> 719.13
structure or they are absolutely totally

715.82 --> 723.9300000000001
oblivious and stupid naturally and

719.13 --> 727.0
somehow managed they're just trying to

723.93 --> 728.769
grab very high way above

727.0 --> 731.05
they can normally reach but this

728.769 --> 734.829
corrupted system like gives them a hand

731.05 --> 741.8499999999999
to do that I think that is how it is

734.829 --> 744.4799999999999
divided so completely delusional people

741.85 --> 747.6990000000001
that are just kind of lost in the

744.48 --> 750.4300000000001
machinations of the propaganda people

747.699 --> 752.3499999999999
that are really dumb that really don't

750.43 --> 757.4699999999999
get it and that are just grasping way

752.35 --> 762.759
too high and the freakin vile signaling

757.47 --> 769.48
Satanist power-hungry monsters and there

762.759 --> 772.629
yet that's who it has become they work

769.48 --> 778.139
together like really no objections they

772.629 --> 781.9490000000001
work together they that's it

778.139 --> 781.949
that's it I think

786.82 --> 795.12
[Music]

789.44 --> 798.2
so yeah I do watch media things for a

795.12 --> 801.12
good reason because I pick up data I

798.2 --> 803.58
pick up data and sometimes I do it

801.12 --> 809.7
almost telepathically empathically I

803.58 --> 813.26
just somebody has an open moment where

809.7 --> 816.6600000000001
the energy is focused and the same time

813.26 --> 819.6899999999999
if it is as they think is correct it is

816.66 --> 822.5699999999999
their narrative it is their truth and it

819.69 --> 826.74
works it's efficient it makes it serious

822.57 --> 828.5400000000001
it it helps the media effort so people

826.74 --> 830.28
always try to do that and Alex Jones

828.54 --> 832.9499999999999
sometimes has very good moments like

830.28 --> 835.41
these but at the same time these are the

832.95 --> 838.5600000000001
moments where I suddenly get much more

835.41 --> 840.81
reach kind of telepathically when I can

838.56 --> 844.3199999999999
zoom in much more and really do more

840.81 --> 850.92
with my with my insight and my structure

844.32 --> 855.1800000000001
oversight skills and that's where one of

850.92 --> 861.29
my peak skills lie and that's why I keep

855.18 --> 861.29
on digging into media and expanding this

861.65 --> 868.91
because I'm really seriously trying to

864.36 --> 868.91
very seriously try to size up the world

871.13 --> 879.99
by myself and not not through I guess

877.38 --> 884.1899999999999
also through what others tell me but not

879.99 --> 886.53
because they tell me but because I just

884.19 --> 889.6500000000001
listen to what others people have to say

886.53 --> 891.12
and make up my own mind but I take it

889.65 --> 894.4499999999999
very seriously

891.12 --> 897.57
and I always have in a way and that is

894.45 --> 900.2900000000001
also why I don't get repelled very

897.57 --> 905.73
easily if somebody says something bad

900.29 --> 908.5999999999999
unless it just it's a personal snare and

905.73 --> 912.24
then you step away most people keep away

908.6 --> 914.88
but if that happens to me then I'm like

912.24 --> 917.269
puzzled because that's like okay there's

914.88 --> 923.66
something I can't handle why

917.269 --> 926.029
this is bad unless it's just obvious

923.66 --> 928.2199999999999
endless endless trolling and negativity

926.029 --> 931.069
because nobody can sit through that

928.22 --> 933.769
normally without becoming one of them

931.069 --> 936.05
that's just normal but if it is just

933.769 --> 939.17
somebody with a message then I must know

936.05 --> 941.3599999999999
what about it repels them and if it lies

939.17 --> 946.55
with something personal or with a

941.36 --> 948.139
principle that I truly follow because I

946.55 --> 950.8689999999999
must get out of the way all the

948.139 --> 954.529
obstacles from my side as to not get

950.869 --> 957.0400000000001
confused about about things with my

954.529 --> 957.04
judgment

959.09 --> 962.599
[Music]

965.93 --> 972.6899999999999
[Music]

974.11 --> 982.33
so anyway that getting very very meta

978.7 --> 984.88
anyway yeah the controllers who are they

982.33 --> 987.76
the narrate the specific narrative ones

984.88 --> 992.35
the ones that are upholding a narrative

987.76 --> 994.45
being public faces with it so we have to

992.35 --> 999.76
still keep in mind that all of this all

994.45 --> 1002.2800000000001
of these public figures that yeah that I

999.76 --> 1004.92
just described are categorized in three

1002.28 --> 1011.13
orders that all of them are basically

1004.92 --> 1016.4599999999999
fronts they they are the executive part

1011.13 --> 1018.68
of their system because they have

1016.46 --> 1022.38
connections and think tanks and

1018.68 --> 1024.6599999999999
industrialists behind them that you will

1022.38 --> 1027.99
rarely hear about until they come into

1024.66 --> 1036.39
view until their something goes wrong

1027.99 --> 1037.86
and they've been dug up basically and to

1036.39 --> 1046.1000000000001
be fair I don't even know much about

1037.86 --> 1046.1
these people oh l younger

1049.06 --> 1068.01
and glass y'all right just force is also

1055.3 --> 1075.36
here Jason McCormick Missy gognitti and

1068.01 --> 1075.36
Brenda fun awesome right

1081.95 --> 1087.3300000000002
what did I talk about about a lot of

1084.629 --> 1094.4289999999999
things I was talking about the

1087.33 --> 1094.4289999999999
Comptroller's just now mostly the the

1094.94 --> 1103.019
the front that are upholding the the

1099.509 --> 1109.169
corporatist extreme liberal mo massively

1103.019 --> 1112.35
Marxist narrative or worldwide that

1109.169 --> 1115.1090000000002
specific side of it it's like the globe

1112.35 --> 1117.84
aspects they they do kind of go with

1115.109 --> 1123.4189999999999
that but it's not their priority that's

1117.84 --> 1126.869
another group but yeah most like for

1123.419 --> 1132.6490000000001
example the Democratic Party or the CNN

1126.869 --> 1135.299
but all these these people they're all

1132.649 --> 1136.9189999999999
the ones that are really also making the

1135.299 --> 1140.269
money from it basically they are all

1136.919 --> 1140.269
categorized in three categories

1144.74 --> 1151.659
now they they don't keep the globe in

1147.98 --> 1151.659
place they don't really care about that

1159.67 --> 1167.29
they're there total opportunists all of

1162.64 --> 1171.01
them they will do whatever is efficient

1167.29 --> 1174.82
or is allowed by the party concept no

1171.01 --> 1177.52
bounce no morale not really as long as

1174.82 --> 1181.23
it is within their capability and they

1177.52 --> 1185.44
all have different angles to all of that

1181.23 --> 1190.09
so you have the the the the true

1185.44 --> 1192.28
psychopath Satanist maniacs that are

1190.09 --> 1195.73
vile signaling that are really proud of

1192.28 --> 1199.8999999999999
the corruption there they are acting in

1195.73 --> 1202.72
and are throwing out it's there yeah

1199.9 --> 1209.89
that those are the worst and then there

1202.72 --> 1212.6100000000001
is the total delusional ones that really

1209.89 --> 1215.8300000000002
believe it and are like religious

1212.61 --> 1219.37
religiously liberal and just they they

1215.83 --> 1222.1
don't see it they don't see that it's

1219.37 --> 1224.1399999999999
corrupted they they think they believe

1222.1 --> 1226.24
all the propaganda basically they can

1224.14 --> 1230.3400000000001
even be kind of intelligent but they're

1226.24 --> 1232.96
just very confused very manipulated and

1230.34 --> 1235.72
those are like the most tragic by the

1232.96 --> 1237.79
way even though overall I I was kind of

1235.72 --> 1240.8500000000001
in that category I used to be like that

1237.79 --> 1243.85
twenty years ago roughly a little bit

1240.85 --> 1245.5
before that maybe 25 years I was like

1243.85 --> 1248.5
that but I wasn't very active was still

1245.5 --> 1254.11
very young kind of modest just it also

1248.5 --> 1257.89
yeah to myself so not ready to be on

1254.11 --> 1259.75
stage of anything but right so that is

1257.89 --> 1261.64
the second category and then there's the

1259.75 --> 1266.62
third category and those are the really

1261.64 --> 1269.38
really dumb people that just overreach

1266.62 --> 1271.9599999999998
just see like oh they can do anything

1269.38 --> 1274.72
they have power I want to be part of

1271.96 --> 1277.06
that I'll do whatever is required of me

1274.72 --> 1278.53
and they really don't get it they'll

1277.06 --> 1280.8999999999999
never get it because they're really

1278.53 --> 1284.91
freaking them and they're overreaching

1280.9 --> 1284.91
and those are the third category

1292.49 --> 1301.799
right like Maxine Waters is kind of [ __ ]

1295.77 --> 1304.98
although you know she may be like really

1301.799 --> 1307.98
freaking dumb on the social level but

1304.98 --> 1313.8600000000001
she's probably really smart when it

1307.98 --> 1316.26
comes to her own wallet so it's always

1313.86 --> 1319.5
going to be yeah even the dumbest of

1316.26 --> 1330.24
people usually are good at something at

1319.5 --> 1332.94
least so alright Maxine Waters is oh and

1330.24 --> 1334.6200000000001
by the way the second category the ones

1332.94 --> 1337.2
that really believe it is all good and

1334.62 --> 1340.6789999999999
everything they can turn to the dark

1337.2 --> 1343.32
side and they are like the really file

1340.679 --> 1347.25
once the vile signalers the total mood

1343.32 --> 1349.95
the demons they seduce the innocent ones

1347.25 --> 1352.95
they basically turn them like turning

1349.95 --> 1355.0800000000002
Jedi to the dark side that's also

1352.95 --> 1358.02
happens and some of them then either

1355.08 --> 1362.6399999999999
eject or they let themselves get

1358.02 --> 1363.71
corrupted and I think that her name

1362.64 --> 1367.74
again

1363.71 --> 1372.929
Alexandria Cortez is one of those and

1367.74 --> 1375.39
you can see the changes when that

1372.929 --> 1378.409
happens when they go through that

1375.39 --> 1380.76
transition you see them visibly change

1378.409 --> 1386.97
everything about them it's like they

1380.76 --> 1390.09
mutate Hillary Clinton I well if Hillary

1386.97 --> 1392.52
Clinton used to be an idealist that must

1390.09 --> 1398.059
have been when she was like a little kid

1392.52 --> 1401.1
and then she just I don't think that

1398.059 --> 1403.9089999999999
Hillary Clinton has been on the dark

1401.1 --> 1408.5
side for a very very long time

1403.909 --> 1408.5
it's miracle she's even alive

1415.17 --> 1424.96
[Music]

1418.259 --> 1426.759
but right and there's more Hillary

1424.96 --> 1431.98
Clinton was a Republican when she was

1426.759 --> 1437.23
younger really huh that's interesting

1431.98 --> 1441.429
okay well maybe it was like when she was

1437.23 --> 1443.679
a teenager she just got totally yeah

1441.429 --> 1446.799
something ripped her soul out and she

1443.679 --> 1448.3300000000002
just went with it somebody basically

1446.799 --> 1451.09
told her like yeah the only way to

1448.33 --> 1453.309
achieve true power is by becoming pure

1451.09 --> 1457.12
evil and letting Satan take control and

1453.309 --> 1459.7
she's just like hmm okay let me think

1457.12 --> 1462.6899999999998
about it and then after a while like

1459.7 --> 1466.1200000000001
yeah you know what this world sucks

1462.69 --> 1468.279
nobody's I don't really care that much

1466.12 --> 1470.4089999999999
and nobody's seemed to be making that

1468.279 --> 1470.889
might have much effort everybody's go

1470.409 --> 1473.1100000000001
nuts

1470.889 --> 1478.1789999999999
everybody's [ __ ] okay I'll go with

1473.11 --> 1481.12
it maybe that's what happened to her and

1478.179 --> 1483.279
yeah there's always and yeah that's one

1481.12 --> 1487.4499999999998
that happens it's you can't describe it

1483.279 --> 1489.49
it's you lose everything it's you never

1487.45 --> 1491.529
get what you expect it's always you

1489.49 --> 1493.84
literally lose everything and nothing

1491.529 --> 1495.639
what you thought meant anything means

1493.84 --> 1498.36
anything anymore everything is turned

1495.639 --> 1498.36
everything is

1500.66 --> 1505.15
[Music]

1505.2 --> 1516.66
all right right now if you're just gonna

1511.8 --> 1521.79
be [ __ ] in my chat then please go

1516.66 --> 1523.3500000000001
somewhere else please I'm talking about

1521.79 --> 1528.6299999999999
this subject because that's now the

1523.35 --> 1533.9099999999999
subject that I'm talking about evil

1528.63 --> 1536.48
people or slaves to evil people and how

1533.91 --> 1536.48
that works

1542.47 --> 1545.47
okay

1572.97 --> 1575.78
right

1579.249 --> 1587.299
yeah good point John Smith

1581.589 --> 1591.829
well that's but that's the trick of the

1587.299 --> 1594.32
Democratic Party now is it isn't it what

1591.829 --> 1598.549
they do is they have what I said the

1594.32 --> 1601.1899999999998
idealists the ones that really believe

1598.549 --> 1601.519
it and they basically let them do their

1601.19 --> 1604.459
thing

1601.519 --> 1608.179
as long as what they're basically the

1604.459 --> 1612.8590000000002
group they're trying to disrupt is not

1608.179 --> 1618.019
the Democratic Party itself so yeah in

1612.859 --> 1619.789
the Vietnam War was basically the other

1618.019 --> 1624.169
side so yeah they're against war they're

1619.789 --> 1625.699
against war soon as a democratic party

1624.169 --> 1627.769
is in power and they're doing some

1625.699 --> 1630.069
warlike thing then it's a whole nother

1627.769 --> 1632.809
story and then suddenly the Republicans

1630.069 --> 1637.9089999999999
go all up to the arms but it's more

1632.809 --> 1642.019
politically driven really then it's yeah

1637.909 --> 1644.6490000000001
then then it's really about the war in

1642.019 --> 1644.6490000000001
that case

1646.42 --> 1652.24
and now well if you look at how things

1649.99 --> 1654.67
seem to be working right now Democrats

1652.24 --> 1659.61
just a lot of them have just turned

1654.67 --> 1667.15
completely it's the corruption has like

1659.61 --> 1669.9699999999998
expanded the narrative is much more

1667.15 --> 1672.39
brutal the party line is much more

1669.97 --> 1677.47
brutal now it's much more Marxist

1672.39 --> 1680.5900000000001
it's not really the the Democrats we

1677.47 --> 1682.54
originally were used to with their

1680.59 --> 1686.02
problems and their issues still in there

1682.54 --> 1688.27
because even back then people knew just

1686.02 --> 1691.17
like just as long as they're cooperating

1688.27 --> 1695.59
and everything that was how that kind of

1691.17 --> 1698.3200000000002
came along but now it's just totally

1695.59 --> 1701.08
crazy the whole thing has become insane

1698.32 --> 1704.56
and it's echoing on it's not just like

1701.08 --> 1706.81
the US that mentality that liberal type

1704.56 --> 1714.46
of mentality has echoed all throughout

1706.81 --> 1716.6399999999999
Europe and it's bound to be echoing in

1714.46 --> 1719.92
other places as well around the world

1716.64 --> 1725.3200000000002
then that narrative that liberal

1719.92 --> 1729.8500000000001
narrative reaches very far if it's

1725.32 --> 1731.34
allowed if the people allow it to allow

1729.85 --> 1734.49
it in their country

1731.34 --> 1734.49
[Music]

1737.59 --> 1741.97
[Music]

1745.74 --> 1755.41
but yeah but seriously what what really

1750.52 --> 1756.76
good good guy like the Liberals used to

1755.41 --> 1760.8400000000001
have like the really good good guys

1756.76 --> 1763.39
which I thought I was myself sort of at

1760.84 --> 1764.98
least when I was really young I put to

1763.39 --> 1773.14
my teens and then weird she had started

1764.98 --> 1776.1100000000001
to happen yeah I was a liberal I thought

1773.14 --> 1777.91
yeah Democrat yeah even Bill Clinton I

1776.11 --> 1779.6799999999998
thought Bill Clinton was a great guy

1777.91 --> 1781.8100000000002
well of course there's a lot of things

1779.68 --> 1784.45
and not cooked about Bill Clinton that

1781.81 --> 1788.4099999999999
I've since learned thanks to in four

1784.45 --> 1794.14
wars also and a lot of the alternative

1788.41 --> 1797.5
media ever since Obama pretty much but

1794.14 --> 1800.89
yeah the Democratic Party that side the

1797.5 --> 1803.17
Liberals the western liberals had really

1800.89 --> 1806.89
good guys in them and there was kind of

1803.17 --> 1807.73
taken seriously but now that's not that

1806.89 --> 1811.5700000000002
anymore

1807.73 --> 1814.81
and no real good personal of the really

1811.57 --> 1817.6299999999999
original good liberals could be like

1814.81 --> 1820.54
they were and now go with this structure

1817.63 --> 1823.41
with this power structure anymore so

1820.54 --> 1826.33
either a lot of those people have

1823.41 --> 1831.0600000000002
corrupted and gone to the dark side

1826.33 --> 1831.06
whether they even realize it or not or

1833.43 --> 1839.3200000000002
or it's just all been replaced like

1837.31 --> 1846.22
other people step up to the plate that

1839.32 --> 1851.86
are like that don't give a [ __ ] anyway I

1846.22 --> 1853.97
see peanuts Clark hello peanuts good

1868.5 --> 1873.41
good can you hear me okay yeah perfectly

1873.77 --> 1880.1299999999999
yeah man I was just um I I caught some

1877.77 --> 1883.3799999999999
of what you were talking about that I

1880.13 --> 1888.14
was kind of making breakfast so I didn't

1883.38 --> 1899.5800000000002
really pay attention yeah so forgive me

1888.14 --> 1902.19
all right so what did you catch you were

1899.58 --> 1903.84
talking about it said obviously it may

1902.19 --> 1907.2
be a group of people or somebody being

1903.84 --> 1911.82
really evil or something yeah talking

1907.2 --> 1918.15
about the well the liberal movement

1911.82 --> 1920.28
pretty much the neo-marxist and what

1918.15 --> 1923.19
type of people are in there in the front

1920.28 --> 1929.12
lines while are there champions in the

1923.19 --> 1929.1200000000001
media and in politics all that

1929.51 --> 1933.35
and so sure yeah

1933.79 --> 1938.17
yeah it's pretty crazy man hmm

1936.76 --> 1941.11
what was it okay if we talk about Flat

1938.17 --> 1947.3500000000001
Earth guy sure it's sweet

1941.11 --> 1951.6399999999999
yep well first of all I gotta ask the

1947.35 --> 1955.4499999999998
the celebrity guy what what do y'all

1951.64 --> 1958.39
call him um that'd be a big big bear big

1955.45 --> 1962.92
bear oh oh and Benjamin hey yeah I mean

1958.39 --> 1964.15
there's he I mean I mean I was up what

1962.92 --> 1966.52
what's up with him

1964.15 --> 1970.72
I mean well he doesn't believe the

1966.52 --> 1972.1299999999999
heliocentrism but he's basically not he

1970.72 --> 1973.39
doesn't want to be a flat earther and

1972.13 --> 1977.2600000000002
he's sticking to that and he's getting

1973.39 --> 1982.18
other guests on that do kind of delve

1977.26 --> 1986.11
into the fringe knowledge that we also

1982.18 --> 1988.6000000000001
deal with as flat-earthers but but that

1986.11 --> 1990.2099999999998
I don't abide to the flatter that are

1988.6 --> 1992.9199999999998
basically sticking to for things like

1990.21 --> 1997.9
geocentrism that's what's happening to

1992.92 --> 2000.93
us to be expected because I think that

1997.9 --> 2005.2800000000002
what Owen Benjamin's thing is to be fair

2000.93 --> 2007.44
I think he yeah this is actually a

2005.28 --> 2009.66
tactical decision of him I think that he

2007.44 --> 2012.9
does the moon landing because apparently

2009.66 --> 2016.14
there's really a thing that Donald Trump

2012.9 --> 2019.88
doesn't believe the moon landings happen

2016.14 --> 2022.2900000000002
and that's so that is why sticks to that

2019.88 --> 2029.8500000000001
not because of Flat Earth even though

2022.29 --> 2034.98
that is kind of very close to it no no

2029.85 --> 2037.53
by the way I learned my lesson by Eddie

2034.98 --> 2040.47
Bravo right I was fooled by Eddie Bravo

2037.53 --> 2043.85
and so what do you mean I never got my

2040.47 --> 2047.3
hopes up on our own Benjamin and I

2043.85 --> 2049.71
always think that what do you mean all

2047.3 --> 2052.86
with Eddie Bravo I'm trying to I'm

2049.71 --> 2055.29
trying to finish my sentence wait I was

2052.86 --> 2057.77
talking about older I was I was using

2055.29 --> 2060.81
Edea as an example I mean like how he

2057.77 --> 2064.62
remember how Eddie came out you know he

2060.81 --> 2067.29
was really like he obviously he couldn't

2064.62 --> 2070.19
be a just a calm person

2067.29 --> 2073.5299999999997
you know he gets all riled up but no

2070.19 --> 2076.13
obviously it's telling people that space

2073.53 --> 2080.84
is fake and stuff like that and then

2076.13 --> 2084.78
coming out and being Vegas strong right

2080.84 --> 2086.1000000000004
and so now everything that he says I had

2084.78 --> 2089.429
to take with a grain of salt I have to

2086.1 --> 2093.21
be extremely skeptical and I really

2089.429 --> 2095.73
liked any man I really did but I'm not

2093.21 --> 2097.11
gonna get burned like that again oh wait

2095.73 --> 2099.33
what happened

2097.11 --> 2102.33
Vegas strut I didn't hear that right I

2099.33 --> 2105.42
think yeah I don't I kind of don't want

2102.33 --> 2107.73
to get into it right now I can talk to

2105.42 --> 2110.1
you about that later but when when did

2107.73 --> 2111.69
this supposedly happen because as far as

2110.1 --> 2116.85
I know Eddie Bravo it's just Eddie Bravo

2111.69 --> 2118.68
and yeah this mean you can have a talk

2116.85 --> 2121.65
one day about this but I don't wanna do

2118.68 --> 2124.47
it on there okay yeah and hit me up on

2121.65 --> 2126.69
skype Verdun okay I want to know I'll

2124.47 --> 2130.31
explain to you what he did what he did

2126.69 --> 2134.2200000000003
uh English um so Owen Benjamin right

2130.31 --> 2135.39
he's always gonna have one foot in one

2134.22 --> 2139.74
foot out

2135.39 --> 2143.64
right and don't get your hopes up folks

2139.74 --> 2148.29
I'm not right get hope ups about what I

2143.64 --> 2152.0699999999997
I don't know for some reason it seems

2148.29 --> 2155.48
like to a lot of people on YouTube it is

2152.07 --> 2158.28
so important that homeland Benjamin

2155.48 --> 2162.69
knows the earth is far and I don't know

2158.28 --> 2167.52
why because he is has a big audience and

2162.69 --> 2170.16
he has big connections big eyes watching

2167.52 --> 2172.95
him know that's why and he's a very

2170.16 --> 2177.12
talented guy but he will never I predict

2172.95 --> 2182.1
he will never turn flat ever publicly

2177.12 --> 2188.31
ever but he will always keep on touching

2182.1 --> 2190.67
it that's his strategy that's what keeps

2188.31 --> 2190.67
him alive

2192.18 --> 2201.609
so uh so kind of to cut around that out

2196.72 --> 2203.35
I like I said he's always gonna have one

2201.609 --> 2204.7599999999998
foot in one foot out

2203.35 --> 2209.3399999999997
I don't think that's ever gonna change

2204.76 --> 2215.59
but hmm do you do you still listen to a

2209.34 --> 2218.56
Marx order listen - well to be fair not

2215.59 --> 2220.78
really following him but I did watch The

2218.56 --> 2224.71
Secret Show with on Patricius and then

2220.78 --> 2228.1000000000004
he's there sometimes I do bump into some

2224.71 --> 2230.17
of his video or yeah if something was

2228.1 --> 2234.8399999999997
particularly good and then I'll watch it

2230.17 --> 2241.6
but he's not regularly in my scope note

2234.84 --> 2243.2200000000003
so you know less marks harder he's he's

2241.6 --> 2245.47
done he's done more for flutter than

2243.22 --> 2247.48
I'll probably ever be able to do there's

2245.47 --> 2250.77
there's something there's a statement

2247.48 --> 2253.78
that he makes at the beginning of every

2250.77 --> 2257.32
interview he does right at the beginning

2253.78 --> 2263.77
of every strange world show you know on

2257.32 --> 2265.8590000000004
TFR right Adam I know that someone

2263.77 --> 2270.78
somebody has already approached him and

2265.859 --> 2274.93
asked him to stop making that statement

2270.78 --> 2276.52
which is that okay so he'll he'll open

2274.93 --> 2280.8999999999996
up his show or he'll open up his

2276.52 --> 2285.369
interview and he'll obviously as he's

2280.9 --> 2288.73
speaking right he is representing a in

2285.369 --> 2293.56
general a flat earther right and so as

2288.73 --> 2298.39
he's speaking he's saying we as in we're

2293.56 --> 2303.88
are at war with science Oh God really

2298.39 --> 2306.85
yes and every time he says I cringed man

2303.88 --> 2311.1400000000003
and he won't stop I know he's already

2306.85 --> 2314.65
been approached and I don't know it's

2311.14 --> 2318.15
weird why he keeps saying that he's so

2314.65 --> 2320.35
wrong I embrace it man now that I

2318.15 --> 2322.21
understand every now that I own is

2320.35 --> 2324.2799999999997
really go ahead go ahead

2322.21 --> 2325.59
no you you make a good point but I never

2324.28 --> 2330.07
even

2325.59 --> 2333.79
realize like I just take it colloquially

2330.07 --> 2338.6200000000003
you know people use the wrong words for

2333.79 --> 2344.14
things all the time as in 95% of the

2338.62 --> 2347.02
time everyone almost everyone that I

2344.14 --> 2349.0
know like righty

2347.02 --> 2350.83
they're they they're very meticulous

2349.0 --> 2353.17
some people are very meticulous but the

2350.83 --> 2357.52
vast majority is absolutely not and

2353.17 --> 2359.23
they'll colloquial eyes everything well

2357.52 --> 2362.77
there's there's there's two things that

2359.23 --> 2364.54
really bothers me and they may not

2362.77 --> 2367.77
bother other people I don't know maybe

2364.54 --> 2371.91
I'm just a 1/1 and I don't know but

2367.77 --> 2377.38
first of all when he says we are at war

2371.91 --> 2384.24
right and I'm not at war with any damn

2377.38 --> 2388.3900000000003
bar right and what you know why are we

2384.24 --> 2391.5699999999997
pulling the finger at some random

2388.39 --> 2394.27
scientist right well I'm not random

2391.57 --> 2397.92
scientist well I mean when he says that

2394.27 --> 2401.89
it's obviously what whatever

2397.92 --> 2406.81
scientists in general that he's labeling

2401.89 --> 2407.8599999999997
right and there's no like let's take an

2406.81 --> 2409.54
astrophysicist

2407.86 --> 2412.08
just-just-just let's take an

2409.54 --> 2416.11
astrophysics right an astrophysicist

2412.08 --> 2419.14
will admit to you that obviously they

2416.11 --> 2422.11
use spectroscopy to know what this

2419.14 --> 2424.0299999999997
lightnings guy is right but at the end

2422.11 --> 2427.38
of the day that they deduce it they

2424.03 --> 2431.65
still will admit that they deduced right

2427.38 --> 2434.71
so should humanity be be pointing the

2431.65 --> 2437.56
finger at this scientists should we be

2434.71 --> 2443.52
at war with a scientist that admits that

2437.56 --> 2449.38
this is a deduction from observing light

2443.52 --> 2452.74
through well it should be categorized

2449.38 --> 2454.26
with speculative scientists sciences

2452.74 --> 2457.0899999999997
that's how I see it

2454.26 --> 2457.9500000000003
the real sciences and speculative

2457.09 --> 2459.9300000000003
science is

2457.95 --> 2463.23
they call it like theorizing like oh

2459.93 --> 2467.3089999999997
it's not yet but that should should even

2463.23 --> 2470.309
be cut cut loose in I think because the

2467.309 --> 2472.92
theory should can only be theory if it

2470.309 --> 2475.17
could actually be potentially proven if

2472.92 --> 2478.77
you could do it if you could feel tested

2475.17 --> 2480.96
but things like what are there that's so

2478.77 --> 2483.599
remote it's pure speculation you're

2480.96 --> 2486.4700000000003
never gonna test that you can only go

2483.599 --> 2490.1600000000003
with deduction based reasoning so I'd

2486.47 --> 2493.2
I'd brand it speculative Sciences

2490.16 --> 2497.1299999999997
they're really emphasized like yeah this

2493.2 --> 2504.1189999999997
is this is definitely not proven

2497.13 --> 2505.799
physically even even you know scientists

2504.119 --> 2507.71
today will know whatever you want to

2505.799 --> 2511.17
label them as men in white coats

2507.71 --> 2513.63
whatever right they even admit right

2511.17 --> 2516.0
that you cannot use the scientific

2513.63 --> 2520.079
method to show that the earth is in

2516.0 --> 2523.799
movement right so why is Mark said

2520.079 --> 2526.349
sergeant saying that we as in flatterer

2523.799 --> 2530.04
because I am openly if learners are to

2526.349 --> 2539.2200000000003
the public right why are we at war with

2530.04 --> 2542.43
a method why right yeah it's it's old

2539.22 --> 2546.839
it's outdated or he's literally ignoring

2542.43 --> 2548.94
the Flat Earth debates so what but I

2546.839 --> 2552.39
know he's been approached and I know

2548.94 --> 2555.839
he's been told that the way you're

2552.39 --> 2560.22
saying it's the complete opposite

2555.839 --> 2565.049
because when I war with anybody right

2560.22 --> 2568.02
I'm not are you at war all right no okay

2565.049 --> 2574.02
well maybe some maybe yes a can of em

2568.02 --> 2578.819
but not with science I mean my war is on

2574.02 --> 2582.42
ignorance I don't know I just two years

2578.819 --> 2587.94
ago I really got my hopes up with this

2582.42 --> 2589.85
right I thought I thought this was rule

2587.94 --> 2593.69
I thought something Jurassic was what

2589.85 --> 2597.5299999999997
right and I've kind of learned to kind

2593.69 --> 2602.3
of just accept that I may not see

2597.53 --> 2606.32
anything in my lifetime but I can at

2602.3 --> 2609.0800000000004
least provide something shoulders to

2606.32 --> 2611.36
stand on for future generations that can

2609.08 --> 2613.52
come by and they can have this knowledge

2611.36 --> 2617.6
and then maybe they can see something

2613.52 --> 2620.5099999999998
out of this well we are already getting

2617.6 --> 2624.38
things out of it look things are

2620.51 --> 2628.03
changing noticeably because what if what

2624.38 --> 2631.85
we're doing good look you shouldn't be

2628.03 --> 2635.42
expecting when there's some kind of

2631.85 --> 2638.33
paradigm shift in thinking or some kind

2635.42 --> 2640.19
of awakening that subtly at the end of

2638.33 --> 2645.38
it there's this glorious magical

2640.19 --> 2650.0
transformation that never happens but

2645.38 --> 2654.02
what does happen is that like a kid you

2650.0 --> 2657.1
can learn and suddenly you slightly

2654.02 --> 2661.16
altered the way things you do things

2657.1 --> 2664.4
based on what you've learned so that is

2661.16 --> 2670.0899999999997
gonna happen and there's gonna be these

2664.4 --> 2674.06
doubts this this fight against illusion

2670.09 --> 2675.92
that's now a thing is basically the the

2674.06 --> 2678.83
counter against the edge of illusions

2675.92 --> 2682.09
like for real that is not easily gonna

2678.83 --> 2685.13
go away and if it's gonna be fought and

2682.09 --> 2687.3500000000004
harshly fought maybe even first with

2685.13 --> 2689.33
censorship maybe even with spying and

2687.35 --> 2693.85
you get arrested and [ __ ] just for

2689.33 --> 2698.36
saying things then the war will go sub

2693.85 --> 2700.73
subterfuge and it'll be like a high tech

2698.36 --> 2703.82
neo feudalism where it's basically

2700.73 --> 2706.43
knowledge is witchcraft it will be that

2703.82 --> 2708.1400000000003
but in a technic in a technical age with

2706.43 --> 2713.2999999999997
technology that is what it could turn

2708.14 --> 2716.75
out to become but it all depends on on

2713.3 --> 2720.55
how much how many people will awaken

2716.75 --> 2724.32
before it will be clamped down upon

2720.55 --> 2728.8900000000003
are people gonna let it all happen I

2724.32 --> 2731.8
like to know I totally agree with the

2728.89 --> 2734.17
first part then you said right you kind

2731.8 --> 2737.1000000000004
of lost me with when you went down

2734.17 --> 2741.19
witchcraft but not just to compare it

2737.1 --> 2742.96
which we yeah witch trials it's gonna be

2741.19 --> 2744.85
like oh they have knowledge they're

2742.96 --> 2749.65
doing something that's not part of the

2744.85 --> 2752.86
normal so then they get pointed at and

2749.65 --> 2756.42
eventually persecuted it's kind of

2752.86 --> 2760.9500000000003
already happening with political issues

2756.42 --> 2764.79
so but you're but you're right like it's

2760.95 --> 2768.46
it's it was it was very naive of me to

2764.79 --> 2773.68
to have those type of thoughts and I let

2768.46 --> 2777.13
my anger consumed me right and because I

2773.68 --> 2781.87
wasn't I wasn't feeling a response I

2777.13 --> 2783.4300000000003
wasn't seeing any type of I I just

2781.87 --> 2788.2599999999998
didn't like the way it was going I guess

2783.43 --> 2790.8399999999997
right and they're like you're exactly

2788.26 --> 2795.1000000000004
right man I had to let it go I did I do

2790.84 --> 2801.33
and I'm just gonna live my life and I'm

2795.1 --> 2805.99
I gotta stop being so mad at the system

2801.33 --> 2808.75
right I gotta stop being so mad at the

2805.99 --> 2812.95
[ __ ] blow excuse me that been too

2808.75 --> 2815.92
close you know like you don't have to

2812.95 --> 2818.6499999999996
stop being mad at it you just have to

2815.92 --> 2823.78
make sure you don't feed this anger a

2818.65 --> 2827.38
lot of energy that is the trick very no

2823.78 --> 2832.1800000000003
discipline discipline thick-skinned

2827.38 --> 2835.4100000000003
that's that's what it's all about that's

2832.18 --> 2838.18
the real fight right it's a drag

2835.41 --> 2843.16
literally being dragged through the mud

2838.18 --> 2845.44
trying to survive the ride that's what

2843.16 --> 2849.49
flat earth is about really yeah I'm

2845.44 --> 2853.09
feeling it trust me I'm feeling it with

2849.49 --> 2854.37
all this dedication and everything all

2853.09 --> 2856.56
the personal motive

2854.37 --> 2858.75
and in the friendship that I found in

2856.56 --> 2861.7799999999997
the support and the creativity that I've

2858.75 --> 2863.91
seen still it weighs heavily upon me I

2861.78 --> 2870.78
was even contemplating this before the

2863.91 --> 2874.5499999999997
show started like like is there any kind

2870.78 --> 2877.32
of improvement on the outlook in general

2874.55 --> 2879.48
without me basically having to break

2877.32 --> 2882.7200000000003
myself in two in order to just get a

2879.48 --> 2885.69
little bit of change that because that's

2882.72 --> 2889.77
often suggested you do that like oh just

2885.69 --> 2891.51
change everything you know just do

2889.77 --> 2899.07
everything differently that that'll work

2891.51 --> 2901.98
out yeah you're right man and I maybe

2899.07 --> 2907.6800000000003
maybe I needed to go through that to

2901.98 --> 2911.27
finally break right and then to realize

2907.68 --> 2914.3999999999996
that all of this is out of my hands

2911.27 --> 2918.12
right whatever is if whatever is in

2914.4 --> 2920.4300000000003
sequence to happen here it's gonna

2918.12 --> 2921.0
happen and there's knowing that I can do

2920.43 --> 2922.98
about it

2921.0 --> 2925.59
so it's nothing that that Big Bear can

2922.98 --> 2928.2
do about it right and there's nothing

2925.59 --> 2933.09
that anybody know that's not true that's

2928.2 --> 2938.81
not true but you can't just sizably do

2933.09 --> 2941.3700000000003
so the only way to do it is to is the is

2938.81 --> 2943.77
literally to pray it but you don't pray

2941.37 --> 2945.9
it by sitting down and taking an hour to

2943.77 --> 2948.3
do this and then saying something and

2945.9 --> 2951.7200000000003
focusing not that kind of praying but

2948.3 --> 2954.51
life prayer you have to be the example

2951.72 --> 2957.81
and then you have to be impressive in

2954.51 --> 2959.5200000000004
order to literally start to make the it

2957.81 --> 2962.61
resonate with other people and that's

2959.52 --> 2966.96
the only way you can actually change

2962.61 --> 2969.69
things by giving another option and

2966.96 --> 2973.38
making sure that that echoes through

2969.69 --> 2975.09
other people the the method the tool the

2973.38 --> 2978.0
energy all the things that come with it

2975.09 --> 2981.51
the system let's say you have to devise

2978.0 --> 2985.23
a system for yourself master it and then

2981.51 --> 2987.44
see if you can let that rub off on

2985.23 --> 2987.44
people

2988.049 --> 2993.609
and we talked about it and yeah many of

2990.999 --> 2996.459
us use Christianity as one of these

2993.609 --> 2999.549
foundations it's like a lot of

2996.459 --> 3003.4199999999996
principles in there are well understood

2999.549 --> 3005.819
like okay you don't necessarily kill gay

3003.42 --> 3012.7690000000002
people for example that those parts are

3005.819 --> 3016.589
we have evolved from taking yeah from

3012.769 --> 3019.529
taking a certain spirit a certain energy

3016.589 --> 3023.549
a certain method out of it and kind of

3019.529 --> 3025.559
taking the other things not as part of

3023.549 --> 3028.2889999999998
the method but because they're so

3025.559 --> 3036.5690000000004
radically different don't take contrasts

3028.289 --> 3038.969
as if they are the same I agree I agree

3036.569 --> 3043.259
I do feel a lot better though man

3038.969 --> 3048.539
because I was there man I was getting

3043.259 --> 3052.65
battered like I don't know I had some

3048.539 --> 3056.19
strange thoughts going to my I just

3052.65 --> 3061.65
didn't know what to do with this with

3056.19 --> 3063.599
the frustration right yeah yes now when

3061.65 --> 3065.789
it hits you when you get the full

3063.599 --> 3068.489
sensation that's like a balloon about

3065.789 --> 3071.9990000000003
the snap yes are your chest I know the

3068.489 --> 3074.43
feeling that's problematic because she

3071.999 --> 3076.1989999999996
can't be fully rational in when you feel

3074.43 --> 3079.499
that kind of pressure so the best way to

3076.199 --> 3082.829
get rid of it is to first realize like

3079.499 --> 3085.109
oh the stress is somehow deteriorating

3082.829 --> 3087.9300000000003
making my rational thinking and focus

3085.109 --> 3092.009
impossible and then try to just get it

3087.93 --> 3093.8689999999997
out somehow and that could be power

3092.009 --> 3095.609
exercising some people do power

3093.869 --> 3098.4590000000003
exercising when they get this kind of

3095.609 --> 3102.119
moment or they just go and trash

3098.459 --> 3105.5389999999998
something or they take an axe and go

3102.119 --> 3109.039
chop wood you know like really brutal

3105.539 --> 3113.969
actions to really exercise that that

3109.039 --> 3116.0600000000004
frustration that can that can work there

3113.969 --> 3120.41
may be other methods

3116.06 --> 3126.02
you know I've here and I've experienced

3120.41 --> 3128.1499999999996
that while serious sex can help and it

3126.02 --> 3130.87
can typically arise when you're in that

3128.15 --> 3137.54
kind of state and the other person is

3130.87 --> 3139.91
viable for it so I don't act on it don't

3137.54 --> 3145.4
if you're irrational through a stress

3139.91 --> 3147.52
then don't do what it tells you that's

3145.4 --> 3150.94
the first part

3147.52 --> 3153.46
seriously I I have I've really

3150.94 --> 3160.4
contemplated and I have really thought

3153.46 --> 3164.2400000000002
dude do I even want to open a discussion

3160.4 --> 3166.31
up to someone around me about flutter

3164.24 --> 3170.14
dude do I want to put him through what I

3166.31 --> 3173.66
went through good point yeah and and

3170.14 --> 3176.72
maybe their life is a lard but they're

3173.66 --> 3180.62
happy right they're happy because they

3176.72 --> 3184.6099999999997
don't know of all this deception and all

3180.62 --> 3186.35
this well you can size it I totally

3184.61 --> 3188.54
agree and I'm immediately gonna wall

3186.35 --> 3190.46
shove it in our winni in fashion because

3188.54 --> 3195.47
I experience this all the time

3190.46 --> 3198.56
I don't flat smack people really I only

3195.47 --> 3200.8999999999996
do it when they're really asking for it

3198.56 --> 3203.21
because they're blood basically but

3200.9 --> 3206.4500000000003
overexposing their bad behavior or

3203.21 --> 3209.0
something or they're being ridiculously

3206.45 --> 3210.95
open and then you may just try it out

3209.0 --> 3215.63
and they'll take anything and then you

3210.95 --> 3218.12
can maybe let it rub off or I just size

3215.63 --> 3219.98
people up I try to get them know them

3218.12 --> 3221.96
first and just see what are they talking

3219.98 --> 3225.83
about what are they thinking about how

3221.96 --> 3229.91
is their mindset do they already have

3225.83 --> 3233.06
like the structural foundational the

3229.91 --> 3236.45
foundation that could become tools in

3233.06 --> 3238.73
order to wield the concept of flat earth

3236.45 --> 3242.33
and the consequences of it so you size

3238.73 --> 3244.31
up people first buy buy they buy they

3242.33 --> 3247.71
serve by their cybernetics by what they

3244.31 --> 3250.97
talk about by how they think

3247.71 --> 3254.73
how series are they about certain things

3250.97 --> 3258.54
and yeah what do they love beyond

3254.73 --> 3262.41
anything else and why always if they

3258.54 --> 3266.46
love something ask why see if they know

3262.41 --> 3269.94
and then eventually you could get to it

3266.46 --> 3271.829
or they might CB be suspicious and start

3269.94 --> 3273.839
asking already like why are you asking

3271.829 --> 3278.309
me all these weird detailed questions

3273.839 --> 3280.77
and if they ask that question then

3278.309 --> 3282.599
that's already a good sign because if

3280.77 --> 3284.16
they start to ask questions like hey is

3282.599 --> 3286.079
there something special you're trying to

3284.16 --> 3288.569
talk about that means they're not trying

3286.079 --> 3293.79
to evade special things people talk

3288.569 --> 3294.21
about so that's a good sign right yeah

3293.79 --> 3297.72
man

3294.21 --> 3300.569
I mean flats packing I don't know I used

3297.72 --> 3302.609
to be all for but now I'm thinking no

3300.569 --> 3304.319
there man here you can do it you're

3302.609 --> 3307.2
chained you changing their whole world

3304.319 --> 3309.7799999999997
man yeah but it might not sound don't

3307.2 --> 3313.74
work with some people with some cultures

3309.78 --> 3317.4
even like for example what is it New

3313.74 --> 3320.819
Jersey I think would be a good place to

3317.4 --> 3322.829
pretty much do that and nobody would

3320.819 --> 3325.52
mind too much because people do weird

3322.829 --> 3327.9300000000003
things all the time over there a very

3325.52 --> 3332.52
open and everything a very expressive

3327.93 --> 3336.14
and and tolerant overall so but yeah do

3332.52 --> 3338.43
it in some kind of closed off village

3336.14 --> 3340.89
well either they might be really

3338.43 --> 3343.6189999999997
Christian and gays be like oh yeah yeah

3340.89 --> 3346.8289999999997
of course sure sure but yeah we just

3343.619 --> 3350.4
focus on the Bible mostly or they might

3346.829 --> 3352.38
be a little bit more metropolitan and

3350.4 --> 3354.27
then have the real allergic response

3352.38 --> 3357.119
because they think they are so superior

3354.27 --> 3359.49
Lee Western and been to space and all

3357.119 --> 3363.2000000000003
that so you have to size up the culture

3359.49 --> 3365.8799999999997
and size up where the region is and then

3363.2 --> 3370.22
you can figure it out is it like can I

3365.88 --> 3370.2200000000003
do that over here would that be accepted

3370.44 --> 3378.06
you really got to get people right or

3375.12 --> 3383.49
when I I tell you another thing that I'm

3378.06 --> 3387.9
I'm really letting go okay and I'm I'm

3383.49 --> 3391.08
letting go of whatever whatever

3387.9 --> 3391.77
superstition or whatever thing is is in

3391.08 --> 3395.22
order

3391.77 --> 3399.06
okay and in dart Iike this okay like my

3395.22 --> 3400.02
like this this Admiral Byrd Captain Cook

3399.06 --> 3402.99
right

3400.02 --> 3406.89
I I'm really really starting to sense

3402.99 --> 3410.37
some deception right for for a long time

3406.89 --> 3413.1
I was dying to go out there and see

3410.37 --> 3417.21
what's out there right and I think

3413.1 --> 3421.74
that's the idea right but there's a real

3417.21 --> 3424.5
what that okay there's a reason that I

3421.74 --> 3427.6499999999996
was taught that Santa Claus lives at the

3424.5 --> 3431.22
North Pole right and I know that may

3427.65 --> 3433.4700000000003
sound silly right I just I kind of

3431.22 --> 3438.2
stepped back and I looked at this I

3433.47 --> 3438.2
looked at fun or kind of over again and

3438.29 --> 3442.8
there's only a handful of people out

3440.88 --> 3448.17
there talking about the North North Pole

3442.8 --> 3450.9900000000002
whatever it is right and for some reason

3448.17 --> 3456.57
I'm starting to think that whatever

3450.99 --> 3461.5499999999997
we're on the center of it could be the

3456.57 --> 3466.32
most valuable part of it and if there is

3461.55 --> 3468.8300000000004
a mentor right and and you you you know

3466.32 --> 3471.15
look at look at these little

3468.83 --> 3478.71
representations of models that we get

3471.15 --> 3481.67
right you got a you know Dave Dave's app

3478.71 --> 3485.04
right I don't know if you see no I

3481.67 --> 3487.4700000000003
understand what data

3485.04 --> 3488.58
David why said they said oh right but I

3487.47 --> 3495.6299999999997
didn't know you had one

3488.58 --> 3497.7599999999998
oh okay forgive me so basically it kinda

3495.63 --> 3500.19
like a pizza and then some of the moon

3497.76 --> 3502.01
and revolving in a circle and the Sun

3500.19 --> 3507.23
the Sun does

3502.01 --> 3511.5400000000004
like a spiral yeah are you with me that

3507.23 --> 3514.22
type of model mm-hmm yeah the disco so

3511.54 --> 3517.13
that there's something very vital

3514.22 --> 3521.7799999999997
missing from there yeah that it it's

3517.13 --> 3525.11
it's what's in the center right I can't

3521.78 --> 3529.8500000000004
deny that something is making these

3525.11 --> 3535.2400000000002
lives above me move something is

3529.85 --> 3535.24
creating the present time right now and

3535.75 --> 3546.14
I don't know it's something something is

3541.97 --> 3548.2999999999997
giving me it's not like a motivation or

3546.14 --> 3550.52
nothing but it's like I really want know

3548.3 --> 3553.46
more about what's at the center of this

3550.52 --> 3557.6
thing and I know at the beginning when I

3553.46 --> 3561.68
became a father it was all about going

3557.6 --> 3564.11
away in Oregon right no I'm not

3561.68 --> 3566.8999999999996
necessarily well maybe that was the

3564.11 --> 3570.65
northbound South Pole not both were they

3566.9 --> 3574.6600000000003
talked about a lot well maybe maybe the

3570.65 --> 3577.48
path that I I come took I didn't get to

3574.66 --> 3580.25
come across a lot of information right

3577.48 --> 3583.4900000000002
well that's also because in the

3580.25 --> 3585.05
mainstream media the South Pole is

3583.49 --> 3588.7999999999997
brought up a lot and the North Pole

3585.05 --> 3590.7200000000003
never that's unless climate change you

3588.8 --> 3593.21
wear usually even then it's the South

3590.72 --> 3596.3599999999997
Pole so that's there's much more

3593.21 --> 3598.46
mainstream attention on the South Pole

3596.36 --> 3602.6600000000003
than there is on the North Pole that's

3598.46 --> 3605.6
north was never really discussed not not

3602.66 --> 3610.1299999999997
really never put into some kind of

3605.6 --> 3613.4
interesting light I am I've really been

3610.13 --> 3617.2400000000002
thinking about the gas pressure argument

3613.4 --> 3619.85
right and again it clicks in my head

3617.24 --> 3622.04
right in order to have that has to be

3619.85 --> 3628.299
pressing against something I get that

3622.04 --> 3631.089
right and I started realizing there

3628.299 --> 3635.109
there may have to be an opening there

3631.089 --> 3637.619
may have to be and obviously I'm just

3635.109 --> 3643.3489999999997
spitballing I don't know enough to

3637.619 --> 3643.349
really make him honest point right but

3643.679 --> 3652.359
something has to be providing the energy

3648.029 --> 3655.889
that we're in and if and if we're in the

3652.359 --> 3658.899
container yeah

3655.889 --> 3663.879
then the energy is are it's already here

3658.899 --> 3667.029
and it's already it's already being

3663.879 --> 3670.089
spent I guess right whether it be the

3667.029 --> 3675.309
either whether it be something at the

3670.089 --> 3676.989
North creating the present time I know

3675.309 --> 3678.369
that sounds silly because I didn't know

3676.989 --> 3681.129
me and you've never talked about it

3678.369 --> 3683.109
oh no I already kind of talked about it

3681.129 --> 3686.2889999999998
but yeah where is the energy of the Sun

3683.109 --> 3691.419
coming from mostly or the daylight where

3686.289 --> 3694.2090000000003
is that coming from I don't know I don't

3691.419 --> 3697.6589999999997
think necessarily it's coming from any

3694.209 --> 3700.4089999999997
specific location on earth I think it

3697.659 --> 3703.029
may be just a natural side-effect of

3700.409 --> 3706.299
energy that just seems to be naturally

3703.029 --> 3708.369
present in the high atmosphere you know

3706.299 --> 3718.599
where is all that energy coming from

3708.369 --> 3720.549
well it's here right yeah and the other

3718.599 --> 3726.099
day when you were when you were trying

3720.549 --> 3729.459
to defend the the force of whatever it

3726.099 --> 3732.809
is trying to find its equilibrium mm-hmm

3729.459 --> 3736.209
relative to a theory right so I am I

3732.809 --> 3739.3590000000004
really thought about kind of what so

3736.209 --> 3743.9489999999996
basically it when that item is returning

3739.359 --> 3744.819
to its equilibrium its that force for it

3743.949 --> 3748.299
to go there

3744.819 --> 3751.149
yeah and it does so even in force like

3748.299 --> 3754.479
fashioned from a standstill point change

3751.149 --> 3757.749
in the medium it starts accelerating and

3754.479 --> 3759.519
then it moves according to how much

3757.749 --> 3761.5099999999998
differential in the relative density of

3759.519 --> 3764.5699999999997
its surrounding there is

3761.51 --> 3767.0600000000004
and yeah how much maneuvering room

3764.57 --> 3770.3590000000004
how much friction there will be and then

3767.06 --> 3774.79
it will get a velocity but it will

3770.359 --> 3777.08
always start accelerating at first well

3774.79 --> 3780.109
I'm not saying I agree with you but I

3777.08 --> 3782.359
understand I understand the point that

3780.109 --> 3785.5099999999998
you were making like illa it clicked in

3782.359 --> 3788.06
me I guess I got it is that I think a

3785.51 --> 3791.09
lot of people didn't but I understood

3788.06 --> 3793.67
what you were trying to point out the

3791.09 --> 3796.04
fourth springs into being because of the

3793.67 --> 3799.9700000000003
relative density disequilibrium the

3796.04 --> 3802.93
combined situation of the surroundings

3799.97 --> 3807.8799999999997
versus the item and the manoeuvrability

3802.93 --> 3811.0099999999998
that yeah that's a direct link yeah and

3807.88 --> 3813.369
as soon as it happens as soon as yeah

3811.01 --> 3816.619
the conditions there is a disequilibrium

3813.369 --> 3821.8
force pretty much equal actually comes

3816.619 --> 3821.8
into being and starts the displacement

3823.09 --> 3833.78
where before everything was just in

3826.09 --> 3836.9300000000003
balance or no force but I think that

3833.78 --> 3840.7400000000002
even at that basically the thing of a

3836.93 --> 3845.5699999999997
force is that a force is basically still

3840.74 --> 3849.0699999999997
a deduction based conceptualization it's

3845.57 --> 3849.07
its motion theory

3850.01 --> 3857.9
I know motion theory like it's kinda

3856.67 --> 3861.619
like you were saying the other day it's

3857.9 --> 3864.1600000000003
it's not relevant like right but it look

3861.619 --> 3867.9500000000003
but it is in a way well it's a

3864.16 --> 3874.04
mechanical thing and you can figure out

3867.95 --> 3877.79
how that works but it yeah it's not it's

3874.04 --> 3882.17
basically deduction based systems like

3877.79 --> 3890.54
yeah like math it is pretty much math

3882.17 --> 3894.05
most of it but I don't want to let you

3890.54 --> 3900.29
know that I understood the point that

3894.05 --> 3902.3
you were defending all right I do it's

3900.29 --> 3904.43
just a tiny point like yeah they're

3902.3 --> 3907.2200000000003
still force that's it it's not even

3904.43 --> 3908.8689999999997
relative it's not relevant to the

3907.22 --> 3910.7
relative density theory neither are

3908.869 --> 3914.4700000000003
directions even though we can definitely

3910.7 --> 3919.1
establish directions based on our own

3914.47 --> 3922.85
yeah agreeance of perception throughout

3919.1 --> 3924.44
humanity it's not relevant to the

3922.85 --> 3925.8199999999997
relative density theory that theory

3924.44 --> 3927.08
stands alone and that makes it

3925.82 --> 3930.05
scientifically provable

3927.08 --> 3934.22
and then there is still more outside of

3930.05 --> 3939.1400000000003
that theory that's it that's how I see

3934.22 --> 3941.9599999999996
it since we were talking about something

3939.14 --> 3947.48
on the debate show another thing I've

3941.96 --> 3950.96
noticed is the conversation of whatever

3947.48 --> 3952.46
is the beginning all right is for some

3950.96 --> 3954.2
reason very important of course I mean

3952.46 --> 3959.27
it's cool it you know it's that's that's

3954.2 --> 3962.48
what they want talk about but uh it to

3959.27 --> 3964.73
me I just doesn't matter like what the

3962.48 --> 3969.4900000000002
beginning is because I'm more concerned

3964.73 --> 3973.4
with the present yeah all right the

3969.49 --> 3976.79
creation nature you know we're like oh

3973.4 --> 3977.27
we was there yeah it's kind of a dead

3976.79 --> 3979.73
end

3977.27 --> 3982.57
it's philosophical debate and it can

3979.73 --> 3982.57
never be yourself

3983.009 --> 3991.439
I just don't see how maneuver first or

3987.089 --> 3993.959
if the Big Bang or if what whatever all

3991.439 --> 3996.149
right what we're still enslaved and

3993.959 --> 3999.989
we're still here right now

3996.149 --> 4000.6189999999997
so I don't understand why they argue

3999.989 --> 4002.389
about that

4000.619 --> 4006.38
of course it's their show is his show

4002.389 --> 4011.4190000000003
because they can well it is very science

4006.38 --> 4013.789
II in a colloquial sense so it attracts

4011.419 --> 4019.189
the right group that their target group

4013.789 --> 4022.4590000000003
for the show nerds and a lot of nerds

4019.189 --> 4027.109
are ballers so that'll make feet for the

4022.459 --> 4038.3889999999997
regular crew it's just a hunting

4027.109 --> 4042.199
technique right really I I debates to me

4038.389 --> 4045.6490000000003
more and more is it's just it's like a

4042.199 --> 4048.309
tournament it's more like a tournament

4045.649 --> 4051.229
or a fighting pit really than an actual

4048.309 --> 4055.509
debate because there are so much

4051.229 --> 4055.509
hostility that always rears his head

4056.409 --> 4062.869
yeah there's there's a lot of lot of

4061.13 --> 4065.779
good points that get made on our show

4062.869 --> 4067.88
that's [ __ ] absolutely and that is the

4065.779 --> 4071.479
the glorious thing about it that even in

4067.88 --> 4074.989
the combats much of the combat is done

4071.479 --> 4077.569
with with insight with intellectual

4074.989 --> 4082.9990000000003
thing with reasoning so the combat

4077.569 --> 4085.459
itself is done verbally but it's not

4082.999 --> 4093.0789999999997
yeah it's really combat it's not just a

4085.459 --> 4096.559
normal debate it's just it becomes kind

4093.079 --> 4099.46
of odd to me because you you have you

4096.559 --> 4104.059
ever you know two or three men you know

4099.46 --> 4106.909
observably showing no curvature right

4104.059 --> 4109.579000000001
and this is something that can be

4106.909 --> 4111.619
observed obviously and measured right

4109.579 --> 4114.7789999999995
it can't be manipulated so therefore

4111.619 --> 4119.99
obviously you can't call it an expiry

4114.779 --> 4124.68
and then those those same guys that are

4119.99 --> 4128.7789999999995
pointing out something that is obviously

4124.68 --> 4133.049
right there in front of our eyes Sten -

4128.779 --> 4140.339000000001
trying to debunk the Big Bang yeah

4133.049 --> 4142.609
and it's odd to me because it's it's a

4140.339 --> 4146.5199999999995
flat earthers are trying to go from

4142.609 --> 4150.450000000001
showing obviously how we observe the

4146.52 --> 4153.540000000001
earth - then they want to go to killing

4150.45 --> 4156.5689999999995
the globe even more and trying to

4153.54 --> 4165.75
disprove something that's probably not

4156.569 --> 4168.299
even true right I mean I mean do you

4165.75 --> 4171.6
care about arguing about the Big Bang do

4168.299 --> 4172.47
you do you do you wanna defend hard

4171.6 --> 4175.799
doing about it

4172.47 --> 4178.83
no conceptualizing about it oh yeah I

4175.799 --> 4181.56
thought look as much as I do with the

4178.83 --> 4183.66
build of the world so can I do with the

4181.56 --> 4187.64
presupposition of the cosmos and how

4183.66 --> 4191.91
that has been conceptualized yeah I am a

4187.64 --> 4194.400000000001
I like science fiction conceptualization

4191.91 --> 4197.82
so and I tried to throw some of that in

4194.4 --> 4203.129999999999
there during the ball busters I didn't

4197.82 --> 4206.79
appreciate it a lot I seriously think

4203.13 --> 4210.03
that all of our all of our ancestors are

4206.79 --> 4213.93
whoever they were that that all lived

4210.03 --> 4218.28
here before us right or or if if you and

4213.93 --> 4223.200000000001
I or our the return energy of someone

4218.28 --> 4225.54
else I don't know right I think that the

4223.2 --> 4228.66
lights in the sky has always been a

4225.54 --> 4233.07
mystery to these people as they are to

4228.66 --> 4236.49
us now and they're just there for us to

4233.07 --> 4244.5
observe them and right and when we start

4236.49 --> 4246.38
trying to pinpoint what they are I don't

4244.5 --> 4250.82
know I don't know I just

4246.38 --> 4253.1
to me it's not it's not important right

4250.82 --> 4256.299999999999
well they're able out there that are

4253.1 --> 4259.25
terrified of not understanding things

4256.3 --> 4263.9800000000005
I'm okay neurotically with they'd rather

4259.25 --> 4263.98
they'd rather believe lies knowingly

4264.19 --> 4270.0199999999995
Lord yeah do be a story they'd rather

4266.9 --> 4273.5
believe dubious stories then accept that

4270.02 --> 4278.120000000001
they will never know they can stand it

4273.5 --> 4280.16
they can they get they get panicked from

4278.12 --> 4284.21
that sensation there's people out there

4280.16 --> 4287.599999999999
like that yeah see that that I'm totally

4284.21 --> 4292.12
okay with not knowing what those lights

4287.6 --> 4296.93
are right I'm totally okay with that

4292.12 --> 4300.98
because I know that when when any man

4296.93 --> 4306.5
right tries to tell me what those lights

4300.98 --> 4310.25
are it's taken it's it's taking its

4306.5 --> 4313.6
appeal away because not knowing what

4310.25 --> 4317.69
they are is way more fascinating for me

4313.6 --> 4324.410000000001
as I observe them and as I go about my

4317.69 --> 4326.419999999999
walk here it's just me we're all

4324.41 --> 4328.61
different you know maybe it's all it

4326.42 --> 4331.1
depends on how you were raised and on

4328.61 --> 4333.71
your own inner needs and if you have

4331.1 --> 4338.240000000001
been kind of spoiled or if your parents

4333.71 --> 4340.88
are like have self-importance issues and

4338.24 --> 4343.4
are constantly like leaning themselves

4340.88 --> 4346.1900000000005
on like how great knowledge of humans

4343.4 --> 4350.99
are and they're yeah that can rub off

4346.19 --> 4353.24
terribly on kids so it all depends on

4350.99 --> 4356.929999999999
your raising I think and what is in your

4353.24 --> 4362.09
nature you're right you're right man

4356.93 --> 4362.51
that's a big part of it and I'm gonna go

4362.09 --> 4364.1900000000005
man

4362.51 --> 4366.62
cuz I'm there you probably want to yeah

4364.19 --> 4369.259999999999
I kind of wanna show that's true okay

4366.62 --> 4371.54
well forgive his great hunger rainbow no

4369.26 --> 4374.96
example no I was the one rambling mice

4371.54 --> 4376.94
at a time or no you made great points

4374.96 --> 4378.72
and good conversation thanks for popping

4376.94 --> 4381.33
by

4378.72 --> 4386.97
thank you hey have a good weekend yeah

4381.33 --> 4389.5199999999995
you too take care all right so thanks

4386.97 --> 4392.25
peanuts Clark's for Clark peanuts

4389.52 --> 4395.67
Clark for coming and thank you everyone

4392.25 --> 4398.73
else for coming and thank you Steve for

4395.67 --> 4400.41
the persistence as Steve and over Mukul

4398.73 --> 4403.4
for the persistent moderating skills

4400.41 --> 4407.79
very appreciated thank you

4403.4 --> 4409.41
yeah was a interesting show I think I

4407.79 --> 4416.18
think it was interesting I hope you

4409.41 --> 4419.61
thought it was interesting too so right

4416.18 --> 4421.83
I'm gonna round out the show if you

4419.61 --> 4425.16
haven't already subscribed to my channel

4421.83 --> 4426.63
and hit about notifications so you know

4425.16 --> 4431.13
when I'm going live which is normally 2

4426.63 --> 4433.17
p.m. after damn time and please if you

4431.13 --> 4437.79
got any support me through the super

4433.17 --> 4440.3
chat my paypal and also subscribe to my

4437.79 --> 4443.7
patreon if you're part of that system

4440.3 --> 4447.75
the crypto link may follow in the near

4443.7 --> 4449.97
future not sure yet when but the any

4447.75 --> 4451.32
donations would be highly appreciated

4449.97 --> 4454.35
and will contribute to the development

4451.32 --> 4458.099999999999
of my show and tools that I will be

4454.35 --> 4463.29
using on it eventually like the

4458.1 --> 4465.18
microphone that I got so I will be back

4463.29 --> 4474.81
tomorrow with letters early-bird number

4465.18 --> 4477.6
180 180 and yeah it will yeah it's going

4474.81 --> 4480.3
to be a weekend thing so I'm gonna try

4477.6 --> 4482.34
to have a more a bigger panel I don't

4480.3 --> 4482.88
know yet if it's safe to throw it in the

4482.34 --> 4486.6
chat

4482.88 --> 4488.79
we'll figure it out but anyway I'm gonna

4486.6 --> 4493.14
also join the Flat Earth debates if

4488.79 --> 4495.0
there's still room on the panel up for

4493.14 --> 4499.200000000001
the video please if you haven't already

4495.0 --> 4501.81
and yeah I will see you on the next

4499.2 --> 4505.97
letter rebirth tomorrow till the next
