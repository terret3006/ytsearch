so well weather has certainly made it

102.96 --> 109.19999999999999
turn around

105.52 --> 112.32
seems like the uh very moist day

109.2 --> 114.799
from yesterday is over

112.32 --> 117.19999999999999
it's nice and dry a couple yeah there's

114.799 --> 120.399
still some big clouds up there

117.2 --> 120.96000000000001
but there's no rain coming out of it and

120.399 --> 124.0
it's

120.96 --> 127.28
nice and sunny warm

124.0 --> 130.239
with a bit of a breeze but also

127.28 --> 131.84
yeah a warm breeze so it's it's really

130.239 --> 134.959
nice

131.84 --> 135.76
spring day i'm seeing a lot of bees

134.959 --> 138.16
going around

135.76 --> 138.16
a lot of

140.28 --> 144.239
[Music]

141.52 --> 144.239
it's them there

144.56 --> 148.8
they try to find holes in the wall and

147.36 --> 157.84
all that i guess for

148.8 --> 157.84
to find some kind of a nasty

163.36 --> 165.68
right

166.64 --> 170.48
hello matthias the walking witness first

168.959 --> 173.36
in chat

170.48 --> 175.92
where am i at i'm where i'm always at

173.36 --> 175.92000000000002
matthias

180.0 --> 187.68
you track the netherlands as always

184.08 --> 191.04000000000002
should know that anyway uh

187.68 --> 196.0
it's wednesday the 12th

191.04 --> 196.0
12th of may

196.84 --> 199.84
2021

206.72 --> 213.84
hello pat fee

216.799 --> 223.68
right hey cameron kamikaze gilmore good

221.12 --> 223.68
to see you

225.28 --> 232.0
hope all is well yeah i'm not doing okay

229.2 --> 241.83999999999997
a good night rest managed to prevent

232.0 --> 241.84
myself from staying up super late again

248.319 --> 255.83999999999997
so let's see

262.96 --> 267.35999999999996
right yeah yesterday was plenty that

264.72 --> 271.44000000000005
i've been doing

267.36 --> 271.44
of course flat earth debate was good

272.639 --> 277.199
uh there was some tea time with barry

275.199 --> 280.40000000000003
and larry as well

277.199 --> 280.40000000000003
and then later in the day

281.12 --> 286.72
kiwi live and i was also on that show

288.96 --> 292.71999999999997
doing quite well although i had some

291.36 --> 297.84000000000003
sound issues at first

292.72 --> 297.84000000000003
just my mic

304.24 --> 307.919
right beside that

309.36 --> 312.16
what did i do

312.479 --> 315.68
oh yeah martin litka

316.4 --> 325.84
it was fun to sit through that

329.12 --> 335.039
oh yeah yeah level up paula

332.32 --> 336.71999999999997
formerly known as bible literalist was

335.039 --> 339.59999999999997
also alive but it

336.72 --> 341.84000000000003
i completely missed that so i didn't see

339.6 --> 341.84000000000003
that

344.16 --> 348.40000000000003
right and then i kind of proceeded onto

346.08 --> 350.479
netflix to see if i could find something

348.4 --> 352.71999999999997
interesting

350.479 --> 352.71999999999997
but

353.919 --> 367.84
not really right so that's pretty much

358.08 --> 367.84
it for yesterday

376.639 --> 381.84000000000003
oh yeah checked out this morning brian's

379.039 --> 386.479
little video

381.84 --> 389.59999999999997
more in detail trencher stuff

386.479 --> 391.84
elaboration on his optical drop

389.6 --> 393.28000000000003
which like at first i didn't realize

391.84 --> 396.479
what that really meant

393.28 --> 398.71999999999997
i did ask him though like

396.479 --> 400.56
after the live show or after the after

398.72 --> 402.08000000000004
show after the recording stopped

400.56 --> 405.199
yesterday

402.08 --> 408.15999999999997
and the optical drop really is just a

405.199 --> 410.8
basic perspective effect

408.16 --> 412.40000000000003
it's yeah i didn't realize that at first

410.8 --> 413.599
it wasn't the bottom up concealment

412.4 --> 416.79999999999995
effect or anything

413.599 --> 419.599
of that nature it's just that

416.8 --> 421.199
within the line of sight things into the

419.599 --> 423.759
distance that are above you

421.199 --> 425.199
will go down to eye level and by the way

423.759 --> 429.12
the opposite

425.199 --> 432.16
also works out if you're

429.12 --> 434.0
like say on a very high up place

432.16 --> 436.47900000000004
tower or whatever and you're looking

434.0 --> 439.599
down on a whole bunch of things

436.479 --> 440.479
then things way down there into the

439.599 --> 443.12
distance

440.479 --> 445.44
will also move up to eye level so the

443.12 --> 448.88
optical drop is

445.44 --> 450.479
is for everything that is like euclidean

448.88 --> 453.52
wise

450.479 --> 456.31899999999996
in like uh

453.52 --> 457.44
yeah euclidean wise above you in

456.319 --> 460.8
relation to the

457.44 --> 462.08
earth realm then it drops into the

460.8 --> 463.68
distance optically

462.08 --> 466.08
i guess that's why it's called optical

463.68 --> 469.759
drop or it's good to

466.08 --> 470.639
clear that up uh discussing blackpool

469.759 --> 474.0
tower i don't know

470.639 --> 474.0
no i don't think so

475.919 --> 479.039
i don't think that brian's video was

477.52 --> 481.84
about that it was about

479.039 --> 481.84
something else

482.08 --> 488.56
another picture but he also did just the

484.8 --> 488.56
physical demonstration of it again

490.479 --> 493.68
uh yeah i did yeah at one point he did

493.039 --> 498.0
also

493.68 --> 498.0
talk about the blackpool swan again

502.08 --> 505.84
right so watch that

516.56 --> 522.7189999999999
hey jim tomaselli

520.08 --> 522.719
good morning

523.76 --> 526.56
amanda young

531.6 --> 537.2
yeah yesterday's show was really good it

534.16 --> 537.1999999999999
was a real blast

537.44 --> 540.48
it was fun to basically have the title

540.08 --> 543.76
and then

540.48 --> 545.839
actually be a big chunk of the show

543.76 --> 548.959
about the title

545.839 --> 549.839
that worked out great i don't have

548.959 --> 553.279
anything

549.839 --> 553.2790000000001
like for today though

555.92 --> 560.8
i didn't yeah i got up pretty late

558.399 --> 577.839
actually at 12 o'clock

560.8 --> 577.8389999999999
still have plenty of time to prepare

584.399 --> 591.839
brian's kicking rumpus at the moment

587.12 --> 591.839
doing really well

592.64 --> 596.56
at the moment is he in some kind of a

594.56 --> 598.959
live thing

596.56 --> 600.8
cameron kamikaze gilmore or in general

598.959 --> 604.2399999999999
because in general yeah of course

600.8 --> 604.4799999999999
most of us are like nathan was even kind

604.24 --> 608.64
of

604.48 --> 608.64
unwilling to let rompers on yesterday

609.279 --> 618.079
which i understand why we discussed it

613.279 --> 620.88
like during the after show i think

618.079 --> 623.04
but still yeah it's almost a wasted

620.88 --> 627.12
opportunity for more numpty

623.04 --> 627.12
clips but uh

627.6 --> 632.48
we'll see where that goes also yeah kiwi

629.839 --> 636.0
life had an interesting

632.48 --> 638.32
thing going because he he really

636.0 --> 639.839
like made room for ballers to make their

638.32 --> 643.7600000000001
points like ed

639.839 --> 643.7600000000001
came in there another guy

644.72 --> 661.839
and really had like the room to speak

647.6 --> 661.839
and that was interesting

662.64 --> 667.4399999999999
uh what was about again oh yeah about

665.519 --> 670.399
rockets in a vacuum

667.44 --> 672.839
that seemed to be the main subject in

670.399 --> 675.839
kiwi life

672.839 --> 675.839
yesterday

693.36 --> 697.04
hmm it's incredible how thick rumpus is

696.16 --> 698.959
these day

697.04 --> 701.519
these people just can't admit to

698.959 --> 704.56
themselves that they were lied to know

701.519 --> 706.48
one wants to believe that but if you're

704.56 --> 708.64
being intellectually honest you can see

706.48 --> 708.64
it

709.76 --> 716.72
well yeah

713.519 --> 717.36
but they just bypass it they just move

716.72 --> 719.6
on it's

717.36 --> 721.04
just standard red herring you know the

719.6 --> 725.0400000000001
the whole process the

721.04 --> 727.5999999999999
the core of it is gaslighting themselves

725.04 --> 729.12
they're just ensuring that they don't

727.6 --> 732.24
catch on

729.12 --> 732.8
and they know they know why they know

732.24 --> 735.04
that

732.8 --> 736.88
what they're doing becomes pointless so

735.04 --> 745.8389999999999
they just postpone it

736.88 --> 745.8389999999999
for all eternity or they try to

747.2 --> 752.399
oh god yeah well pet feet nobody gives a

750.16 --> 752.399
[ __ ]

753.2 --> 760.8000000000001
all right really really nobody

758.079 --> 764.079
know rant is being paraded around lucky

760.8 --> 764.079
some kind of a victory

764.56 --> 768.3199999999999
but it's all hollow victory

768.639 --> 773.839
like ranty's not going anywhere after

771.04 --> 773.8389999999999
this

781.6 --> 789.36
it was quite as qui was quite a stir

784.839 --> 791.36
up right well yeah that's because

789.36 --> 792.8000000000001
paul it's especially because of the

791.36 --> 795.6
ballers themselves

792.8 --> 797.5999999999999
like they need to believe there is some

795.6 --> 799.12
way out of flat earth once you go there

797.6 --> 802.24
that you can get back

799.12 --> 805.2
right because that is some to them

802.24 --> 807.519
from their vantage point an esoteric

805.2 --> 810.9590000000001
sign

807.519 --> 814.079
that that there is no

810.959 --> 815.04
definitive wind right from the flatter

814.079 --> 817.279
side that's

815.04 --> 818.3199999999999
that's what they desperately seek for

817.279 --> 821.8389999999999
and if somebody

818.32 --> 824.639
just for whatever reason publicly

821.839 --> 828.639
converts back to the ball and starts

824.639 --> 831.12
making their excuses again then

828.639 --> 832.8
from the unknowing perspective that they

831.12 --> 835.519
hold because they actively prevent

832.8 --> 839.68
themselves from actually understanding

835.519 --> 843.12
then it seems like yeah it is like this

839.68 --> 844.3199999999999
weird thing to be a flat earther and you

843.12 --> 847.519
can

844.32 --> 850.32
step out of it like you they

847.519 --> 851.6
they want to dispel once you go flat you

850.32 --> 854.839
can't come back

851.6 --> 857.839
that's what they want to dispel

854.839 --> 857.839
desperately

858.079 --> 862.079
and that's why ranty is being paraded

860.56 --> 871.8389999999999
around like that

862.079 --> 871.8389999999999
even by you pat fee

882.839 --> 885.839
right

899.279 --> 902.8
so yeah i'm really not worried about

901.6 --> 905.839
ranty

902.8 --> 906.959
suddenly saying he's a baller and acting

905.839 --> 910.32
like it

906.959 --> 912.16
like it it just doesn't matter

910.32 --> 914.24
and i think that a lot of ballers

912.16 --> 917.04
overestimate

914.24 --> 919.279
it doesn't matter you believe in the

917.04 --> 921.199
ball and you refuse to get into flat

919.279 --> 925.36
earth it doesn't matter

921.199 --> 925.3599999999999
you see doesn't matter to us

925.44 --> 929.519
especially to us it really doesn't like

928.639 --> 931.36
the only

929.519 --> 933.199
thing that would be good about it in a

931.36 --> 936.8000000000001
direct sense is that

933.199 --> 940.3199999999999
you'd probably stop nagging

936.8 --> 942.24
with yeah with baller comments tropes

940.32 --> 944.32
things that have been repeated endlessly

942.24 --> 946.48
and been refuted every single step of

944.32 --> 950.639
the way it's just that at some point

946.48 --> 953.04
the flat earthers me included get tired

950.639 --> 954.0
of handing you the same refutes over and

953.04 --> 956.3199999999999
over again

954.0 --> 958.88
because you seem to forget it every time

956.32 --> 963.0400000000001
on purpose

958.88 --> 966.639
right in a weird subconscious twist

963.04 --> 969.8389999999999
ballers in chats and in general

966.639 --> 970.8
try to use indoctrination interrogation

969.839 --> 973.12
techniques

970.8 --> 974.0
by just repeating the same line over and

973.12 --> 976.8
over again

974.0 --> 978.32
in a question form demanding an answer

976.8 --> 980.959
from their entire the one they

978.32 --> 980.9590000000001
interrogate

981.12 --> 986.0
right so that they will just give up

984.72 --> 988.88
explaining it

986.0 --> 989.68
right that's interrogation technique

988.88 --> 991.8389999999999
actually

989.68 --> 992.959
right don't know if anybody realizes

991.839 --> 996.1600000000001
that

992.959 --> 998.399
look into that

996.16 --> 1000.88
just repeating the same thing over and

998.399 --> 1002.88
over again

1000.88 --> 1005.8389999999999
it could be refuted because it's asking

1002.88 --> 1005.8389999999999
the question form

1006.639 --> 1012.72
that's what they do in yeah re-education

1010.639 --> 1014.16
literally that's what they do

1012.72 --> 1016.399
re-education

1014.16 --> 1018.399
ask the same thing over and over again

1016.399 --> 1019.519
until you get the answer you want to

1018.399 --> 1022.079
hear

1019.519 --> 1024.079
as the interrogator yeah that's

1022.079 --> 1026.559
re-education technique

1024.079 --> 1027.6
and that's what ballers do all the time

1026.559 --> 1031.039
even in basic

1027.6 --> 1032.6399999999999
chats all the time because they could

1031.039 --> 1036.16
get the correct answer

1032.64 --> 1037.679
it's just not what they want to hear

1036.16 --> 1039.76
right so then they get the correct

1037.679 --> 1043.439
answer then they forget about it

1039.76 --> 1046.16
on purpose maybe move on

1043.439 --> 1047.28
or just ask the same question over again

1046.16 --> 1049.28
right

1047.28 --> 1050.96
nobody's better at this than sean

1049.28 --> 1053.52
hawkins

1050.96 --> 1054.96
he keeps asking the same damn question

1053.52 --> 1057.84
on a daily basis for

1054.96 --> 1059.679
years now has been answered so many

1057.84 --> 1061.12
times in so many ways and he just

1059.679 --> 1063.679
doesn't care

1061.12 --> 1064.3999999999999
because he doesn't listen to the answer

1063.679 --> 1066.72
he ju

1064.4 --> 1068.5590000000002
the only answer sean hawkins ever

1066.72 --> 1072.24
listens to with the stupid

1068.559 --> 1075.36
polaris star rotation whatever

1072.24 --> 1077.52
question is yes you're right sean

1075.36 --> 1079.4399999999998
hawkins it proves that the earth is not

1077.52 --> 1081.52
flat because it can't be possible so it

1079.44 --> 1085.2
must be a globe that's the only

1081.52 --> 1088.4
response that he's fishing for

1085.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
nothing else nothing else see

1088.4 --> 1095.8400000000001
that's what he does

1096.4 --> 1098.72
ah

1104.64 --> 1109.3600000000001
no pat fee no that's not the same thing

1106.799 --> 1112.16
that nathan is doing basically every day

1109.36 --> 1114.9599999999998
with housekeeping questions right

1112.16 --> 1117.3600000000001
because the housekeeping questions

1114.96 --> 1118.48
could be answered and people try to

1117.36 --> 1121.52
answer them

1118.48 --> 1123.52
it's not hand waved it's addressed

1121.52 --> 1126.24
the response is addressed that's

1123.52 --> 1128.48
something that ballers don't do

1126.24 --> 1130.08
when they get an answer to one of their

1128.48 --> 1133.2
questions that they think

1130.08 --> 1136.799
cannot be answered they don't actually

1133.2 --> 1138.16
listen to the answer they don't ask for

1136.799 --> 1141.2
clarification

1138.16 --> 1144.88
to understand the rebuttal right

1141.2 --> 1147.1200000000001
flat earthers especially nathan and crew

1144.88 --> 1149.5200000000002
the flat earth debates they do do that

1147.12 --> 1152.2399999999998
they do inquire further

1149.52 --> 1154.48
they repeat it back they lay out the

1152.24 --> 1157.76
structure of it

1154.48 --> 1160.16
and point at the fallacies

1157.76 --> 1161.12
that's what we do so it's not the same

1160.16 --> 1164.24
not at all

1161.12 --> 1167.12
that's yeah

1164.24 --> 1167.679
i know you want to basically flip it

1167.12 --> 1170.2399999999998
around

1167.679 --> 1172.72
every single time projection is the

1170.24 --> 1174.4
number one defensive mechanism

1172.72 --> 1176.24
with ballers that are cornered they

1174.4 --> 1178.0800000000002
project everything they they turn to

1176.24 --> 1181.52
reverse world tactics

1178.08 --> 1184.08
so any argument anything cleared up

1181.52 --> 1186.6399999999999
from a flat earther site will be used

1184.08 --> 1188.799
turn around 180 degrees and project it

1186.64 --> 1191.679
right back

1188.799 --> 1193.84
ballers driven in a corner act like

1191.679 --> 1196.0
they're a flat earther

1193.84 --> 1197.1999999999998
and the flat earther is the baller and

1196.0 --> 1201.52
then they

1197.2 --> 1206.64
pretend like they're in that position

1201.52 --> 1209.12
it's almost like parroting

1206.64 --> 1210.64
except they reverse the rules during the

1209.12 --> 1213.76
parroting

1210.64 --> 1216.88
it's it's nothing more than know you

1213.76 --> 1218.08
as how a six-year-old learns to be

1216.88 --> 1220.96
defiant

1218.08 --> 1222.48
no you know you that's it that's the

1220.96 --> 1226.559
projecting that's what

1222.48 --> 1226.559
what ballers do that's what you do padfe

1230.96 --> 1234.559
benji mcdonald what are you talking

1232.84 --> 1237.76
about

1234.559 --> 1241.12
over the bacterial fundraising

1237.76 --> 1241.12
i don't know what you're talking about

1246.08 --> 1249.84
hey seeking star wars by the way

1285.919 --> 1290.7990000000002
right so benjamin donaldson please

1288.72 --> 1292.48
respond because if that's just

1290.799 --> 1295.2
it if that's the only thing you're gonna

1292.48 --> 1295.2
say then

1296.799 --> 1300.559
i'm just gonna take you as an

1299.28 --> 1305.84
information

1300.559 --> 1305.84
information placement agent troll

1306.88 --> 1313.7600000000002
right spreading wild rumors that make no

1311.84 --> 1318.559
sense

1313.76 --> 1322.1589999999999
you have more

1318.559 --> 1324.1589999999999
i don't want more i want to know

1322.159 --> 1333.8400000000001
exactly what you're talking about with

1324.159 --> 1333.8400000000001
your previous statement

1335.76 --> 1340.1589999999999
why is gas pressure in a container

1337.6 --> 1342.9599999999998
uniform the entire volume

1340.159 --> 1345.6100000000001
but atmospheric pressure on a container

1342.96 --> 1347.039
flat earth model varies

1345.61 --> 1349.84
[Music]

1347.039 --> 1351.919
gas pressure is not uniform in a

1349.84 --> 1352.559
container unless the container is really

1351.919 --> 1356.159
small

1352.559 --> 1356.1589999999999
but scale matters

1356.64 --> 1364.3200000000002
and there is other influences

1359.679 --> 1366.3200000000002
than just containment within the realm

1364.32 --> 1368.3999999999999
i've suspected for a long time there is

1366.32 --> 1371.2
a direct pressure

1368.4 --> 1372.8400000000001
influence within the realm due to

1371.2 --> 1375.76
temperature

1372.84 --> 1377.6
differentials at height

1375.76 --> 1379.28
so there's a lot more heat being

1377.6 --> 1381.4399999999998
introduced at ground level

1379.28 --> 1383.36
as a rule of fist in general during the

1381.44 --> 1386.559
day

1383.36 --> 1390.559
and up there it seems to be a lot colder

1386.559 --> 1393.36
so this however that is caused

1390.559 --> 1394.1589999999999
within the realm setup that is

1393.36 --> 1397.9189999999999
definitely

1394.159 --> 1399.0390000000002
provably contributing to the gradation

1397.919 --> 1401.919
of the air pressure

1399.039 --> 1403.679
within it and you can demonstrate this

1401.919 --> 1404.159
on a smaller scale as well if you take

1403.679 --> 1407.3600000000001
us

1404.159 --> 1411.2800000000002
an actual man-made smaller container

1407.36 --> 1413.12
you put a heat influencing device on one

1411.28 --> 1414.799
side of the container and a cold

1413.12 --> 1416.9599999999998
influencing on the other side

1414.799 --> 1418.4
a gradient within the gas pressure

1416.96 --> 1421.8400000000001
within that container

1418.4 --> 1425.039
will form as well right

1421.84 --> 1427.9189999999999
so i hope that explains

1425.039 --> 1427.919
your question

1428.84 --> 1431.84
overrider

1433.76 --> 1437.76
oh okay right yeah so you're just a

1435.76 --> 1445.84
slandering scumbag well get the [ __ ] out

1437.76 --> 1445.84
of here then

1447.76 --> 1451.679
might not be around too much longer yeah

1450.4 --> 1457.279
good luck with that

1451.679 --> 1460.3200000000002
[ __ ] no no bear terry is here to stay

1457.279 --> 1463.76
right as the world goes the [ __ ]

1460.32 --> 1464.6399999999999
bertaria is gonna stay right just like

1463.76 --> 1467.279
flat earth

1464.64 --> 1468.3200000000002
the flat earth that was going away any

1467.279 --> 1470.96
moment now

1468.32 --> 1473.52
for five years straight and more

1470.96 --> 1475.6000000000001
remember that trolls oh it's good

1473.52 --> 1478.0
it's failing the flat earth is failing

1475.6 --> 1479.1999999999998
and now owen benjamin is failing bertare

1478.0 --> 1481.84
it's all doomed and

1479.2 --> 1484.799
everything is wrong with it yeah yeah

1481.84 --> 1488.0
wishful thinking buddy

1484.799 --> 1500.24
really from a petty position

1488.0 --> 1502.32
also so yeah it's not gonna go away

1500.24 --> 1503.919
constant evaporation contributes to

1502.32 --> 1507.6
pressure at ground level

1503.919 --> 1509.279
well yeah but that's consequence that's

1507.6 --> 1512.8799999999999
a secondary thing right because

1509.279 --> 1514.88
evaporation doesn't just randomly happen

1512.88 --> 1515.919
it happens because of the conditions and

1514.88 --> 1519.0390000000002
those conditions

1515.919 --> 1522.5590000000002
in fact are heat the heat causes

1519.039 --> 1525.6
evaporation of water

1522.559 --> 1527.279
right so again yes

1525.6 --> 1529.6789999999999
low pressure at ground level due to

1527.279 --> 1532.32
evaporation but that's because

1529.679 --> 1532.3200000000002
of the heat

1535.279 --> 1543.84
hey clutch bear and andrew too by the

1540.84 --> 1543.84
way

1561.2 --> 1564.48
slo-mo moon buggy

1567.84 --> 1572.48
nice benjamin donaldson works at the

1571.12 --> 1585.84
rollerblade museum

1572.48 --> 1585.84
in ibiza allegedly that's brilliant

1601.279 --> 1605.2
okay iron fee that's interesting

1611.12 --> 1616.12
right well the thing is however the gas

1614.559 --> 1620.559
pressure is

1616.12 --> 1624.3999999999999
distributed within a container

1620.559 --> 1626.72
right if there is no

1624.4 --> 1629.2
leak to the container to some kind of a

1626.72 --> 1631.84
lower pressure system surrounding it

1629.2 --> 1634.72
it's all pressing against each other

1631.84 --> 1638.48
against the walls of the container

1634.72 --> 1640.24
and then however the gases might have a

1638.48 --> 1643.279
different pressure or

1640.24 --> 1644.159
average density because of that within

1643.279 --> 1646.32
the container

1644.159 --> 1647.8400000000001
doesn't matter because it all finds a

1646.32 --> 1650.96
balance

1647.84 --> 1652.32
pressuring each other and the container

1650.96 --> 1654.88
walls

1652.32 --> 1656.08
so yes a gradient within a sealed

1654.88 --> 1658.24
container

1656.08 --> 1660.08
as long as the gas is in a stable

1658.24 --> 1663.039
fashion just pressing against the

1660.08 --> 1664.48
each other and the walls it'll just stay

1663.039 --> 1669.84
that way

1664.48 --> 1669.84
gradated non-gradiated either way

1673.84 --> 1683.84
hello agent

1691.76 --> 1695.52
right but that's something by the way

1693.2 --> 1696.32
that i that i really caught on to

1695.52 --> 1701.9189999999999
yesterday

1696.32 --> 1701.9189999999999
during the qe life that conception that

1702.24 --> 1709.44
any gas pressure whether it is

1705.36 --> 1712.559
like even in a rocket or anything

1709.44 --> 1715.2
it only works because it presses against

1712.559 --> 1718.32
the gas that surrounds it which presses

1715.2 --> 1719.1200000000001
against the gases that surround it that

1718.32 --> 1723.039
eventually

1719.12 --> 1723.76
cascade on until it meets the container

1723.039 --> 1726.399
walls

1723.76 --> 1727.919
so it's really the container walls every

1726.399 --> 1731.6
single time

1727.919 --> 1735.2
that effectively press against

1731.6 --> 1737.9189999999999
the gas pressure that is created locally

1735.2 --> 1741.039
wherever it is within the container

1737.919 --> 1744.159
that causes the yeah

1741.039 --> 1745.919
the obj the rocket to move so if there's

1744.159 --> 1748.48
no container walls

1745.919 --> 1750.48
for the gas to bump into the gas that

1748.48 --> 1751.76
surrounds them that cascades on to the

1750.48 --> 1754.559
container walls

1751.76 --> 1756.0
then there will never be any lift there

1754.559 --> 1758.399
will not be

1756.0 --> 1760.0
a pressure build up in order to cause a

1758.399 --> 1764.4799999999998
physical displacement

1760.0 --> 1765.84
of the well the rocket

1764.48 --> 1768.3990000000001
and that was very interesting

1765.84 --> 1771.12
realization how that works like i really

1768.399 --> 1773.279
got this oversight now

1771.12 --> 1774.6399999999999
i could probably title the show like

1773.279 --> 1777.2
this

1774.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
to think a good arranging arrangement

1777.2 --> 1781.8400000000001
for that was this

1784.24 --> 1787.76
where are you getting it oh you didn't

1785.76 --> 1791.76
need to time them out for that

1787.76 --> 1794.799
just let them clutch bear this is not

1791.76 --> 1797.679
uh this is not owen benjamin chat just

1794.799 --> 1802.399
for the record clutch bear

1797.679 --> 1805.76
right in contrast to owen benjamin i do

1802.399 --> 1807.9189999999999
leave gammas in the chat and if they

1805.76 --> 1809.36
if they start squirting really badly

1807.919 --> 1812.0800000000002
i'll take care of it

1809.36 --> 1812.6399999999999
but in general i like to address their

1812.08 --> 1816.72
gamma

1812.64 --> 1819.919
attempts to to try to get that fun

1816.72 --> 1821.679
foundation under like they want to rip

1819.919 --> 1823.919
the carpet from underneath you

1821.679 --> 1825.679
that's what they want to do every time

1823.919 --> 1827.8400000000001
well i'm i'm pretty good i've become

1825.679 --> 1830.96
pretty good at carpet dancing like this

1827.84 --> 1834.72
right so i'm actually

1830.96 --> 1835.76
using them to bring out information that

1834.72 --> 1839.44
they thought

1835.76 --> 1841.84
i couldn't handle and then learn a skill

1839.44 --> 1841.8400000000001
with it

1841.919 --> 1846.0800000000002
right that's also the reason pat fee is

1843.919 --> 1846.7990000000002
still here because he tried to do that

1846.08 --> 1849.4399999999998
too a lot

1846.799 --> 1853.12
in the beginning and then you learn it

1849.44 --> 1853.1200000000001
just doesn't work with arwin

1853.52 --> 1859.039
i respond as

1856.559 --> 1860.8799999999999
if you were actually asking a question

1859.039 --> 1863.2
when you do that

1860.88 --> 1865.1200000000001
and not just trying to prod right trying

1863.2 --> 1866.159
to trigger now i actually just answer

1865.12 --> 1868.08
the question

1866.159 --> 1870.64
right it's very unexpected every time

1868.08 --> 1872.6399999999999
must seem kind of magical

1870.64 --> 1873.8400000000001
once you figure out that i do that every

1872.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
time

1873.84 --> 1879.84
then you stop doing that

1889.279 --> 1893.44
but i appreciate look if somebody gets

1891.679 --> 1895.279
really disgusting in chat right

1893.44 --> 1897.279
look at the chat rules right that's how

1895.279 --> 1899.36
it works look in the description box

1897.279 --> 1901.44
there's very specific chat rules

1899.36 --> 1903.1999999999998
somebody gets like really disgusting or

1901.44 --> 1906.88
sexual or something

1903.2 --> 1910.72
right that's when you can time them out

1906.88 --> 1913.0390000000002
but if they're just being gammas

1910.72 --> 1914.799
that's not sufficient reason it's only

1913.039 --> 1916.96
when they get like really violent or

1914.799 --> 1921.84
perverted or something

1916.96 --> 1921.8400000000001
all right

1922.159 --> 1925.6000000000001
hello iron effie

1927.6 --> 1935.84
uh anyway

1942.64 --> 1950.159
gas pumps never stop pumping that's a

1945.519 --> 1950.159
different type of gas all right

1952.559 --> 1957.039
but yeah overrider makes actually a

1954.559 --> 1960.799
point what will i do when flat earth

1957.039 --> 1963.679
stop bringing income it's true

1960.799 --> 1964.0
and if even kind of well held it against

1963.679 --> 1967.039
you

1964.0 --> 1968.799
all in the past and i probably will keep

1967.039 --> 1970.24
doing that

1968.799 --> 1972.32
right i don't want to be complaining

1970.24 --> 1973.84
pants it's been seven days since i last

1972.32 --> 1977.279
had a

1973.84 --> 1980.0
paypal donation right now

1977.279 --> 1980.399
i don't know the situation out there

1980.0 --> 1983.84
it's

1980.399 --> 1985.76
come with waves in the past so

1983.84 --> 1987.84
but i really do need it and i've been

1985.76 --> 1991.36
trying to tell people that

1987.84 --> 1994.32
i've got some serious bills

1991.36 --> 1996.6399999999999
uh what's my discord server link oh god

1994.32 --> 1999.84
it's been in ages

1996.64 --> 2003.519
uh what what will i do

1999.84 --> 2003.84
i don't know what i'll do could probably

2003.519 --> 2006.24
be

2003.84 --> 2006.24
anything

2007.44 --> 2021.8400000000001
okay let me our wind server

2018.159 --> 2024.96
all right this is the our wind server

2021.84 --> 2027.12
link if you want to join but

2024.96 --> 2029.3600000000001
i i haven't really done anything it's

2027.12 --> 2032.7199999999998
it's literally

2029.36 --> 2036.4799999999998
oh there's some messages

2032.72 --> 2039.679
in there but there's really no

2036.48 --> 2042.48
actual activity i

2039.679 --> 2043.6000000000001
yeah i i thought it was an earlier idea

2042.48 --> 2046.32
to do it but then

2043.6 --> 2048.48
i kind of like felt it wasn't really

2046.32 --> 2050.639
necessary anymore

2048.48 --> 2052.2400000000002
but yeah i'm keeping it there and at one

2050.639 --> 2055.359
point maybe

2052.24 --> 2061.839
i'll actually start really using it

2055.359 --> 2061.839
but not at the current time

2086.839 --> 2089.839
um

2100.36 --> 2103.489
[Music]

2109.28 --> 2117.44
well overrider it's simple you're wrong

2114.079 --> 2120.8
it's not true you can see polaris

2117.44 --> 2122.32
and the southern cross both above the

2120.8 --> 2125.6800000000003
horizon

2122.32 --> 2128.0
when you're at the equator so

2125.68 --> 2129.68
your entire inquiry is a straw man why

2128.0 --> 2132.8
can't you do this

2129.68 --> 2135.839
when you can do that you can

2132.8 --> 2138.4
you can see polaris south of the equator

2135.839 --> 2140.16
you can see part of the southern cross

2138.4 --> 2143.28
north of the equator

2140.16 --> 2146.8799999999997
right above the horizon

2143.28 --> 2149.6800000000003
that makes no sense on the globe

2146.88 --> 2150.48
it should be like in the horizon on a

2149.68 --> 2158.56
globe or

2150.48 --> 2161.44
even worse below it

2158.56 --> 2163.2799999999997
like why can you stand at the equator

2161.44 --> 2166.8
even at ground level

2163.28 --> 2169.8390000000004
and then see polaris to the north

2166.8 --> 2173.2000000000003
and the southern cross to the south well

2169.839 --> 2176.96
above the horizon that makes

2173.2 --> 2176.96
absolutely no sense on the globe

2177.839 --> 2183.04
and there's no like warping distortion

2180.64 --> 2186.7999999999997
going on either it's just all consistent

2183.04 --> 2188.32
angular speeds of all the stars in

2186.8 --> 2189.119
relation to one another there's no

2188.32 --> 2193.6800000000003
warping

2189.119 --> 2196.32
going on it's visually as is

2193.68 --> 2197.04
no alteration so how does that work out

2196.32 --> 2201.839
on a globe

2197.04 --> 2201.839
it doesn't at all

2211.119 --> 2214.56
is it possible to build a functioning

2213.119 --> 2218.48
garden inside the vacuum

2214.56 --> 2220.0
no but you can have it in a sealed

2218.48 --> 2223.52
container though

2220.0 --> 2228.96
right those little forests in a

2223.52 --> 2232.64
in a in a glass jar they do that

2228.96 --> 2236.56
but they do require gas pressure

2232.64 --> 2238.96
right all life requires

2236.56 --> 2241.359
a certain level of gas pressure in order

2238.96 --> 2244.32
to keep its own pressure regulations

2241.359 --> 2247.359
which happens in all life

2244.32 --> 2251.04
like hydrodynamics

2247.359 --> 2252.16
cellular osmosis it requires a certain

2251.04 --> 2254.88
level of pressure

2252.16 --> 2257.839
to be present in order to function

2254.88 --> 2257.839
stably

2259.04 --> 2274.32
terrarium that's that's the thing yes

2271.359 --> 2275.52
um have you actually been in it well

2274.32 --> 2278.32
i've seen

2275.52 --> 2278.32
live footage

2280.56 --> 2285.839
video footage unedited

2286.4 --> 2290.8
time lapse and regular and that's years

2289.76 --> 2294.2400000000002
ago i saw that

2290.8 --> 2294.2400000000002
so it's out there on youtube

2297.2 --> 2305.4399999999996
so are you asking why you don't see the

2300.72 --> 2308.72
full globe of the heavens at all times

2305.44 --> 2310.4
well if you assume you would see a full

2308.72 --> 2312.3999999999996
globe of the heavens which is

2310.4 --> 2315.2000000000003
contradictory of course because

2312.4 --> 2317.28
you only ever get to see a demi sphere

2315.2 --> 2320.0
you never get to see it all

2317.28 --> 2320.32
that's only based on the assumption that

2320.0 --> 2325.04
the

2320.32 --> 2327.599
entire star output the entire heavens

2325.04 --> 2328.8
including this planet planets sun and

2327.599 --> 2331.76
moon

2328.8 --> 2332.88
that they are literally lights hanging

2331.76 --> 2335.5200000000004
in the sky

2332.88 --> 2337.599
over the earth that's what that

2335.52 --> 2340.8
misassumption is based upon

2337.599 --> 2341.119
right that's not what happening that's

2340.8 --> 2343.599
what

2341.119 --> 2345.04
not what's happening on a flat earth all

2343.599 --> 2347.44
of these heavenly bodies

2345.04 --> 2348.079
are holographic in nature and present

2347.44 --> 2351.2000000000003
themselves

2348.079 --> 2352.079
only as a demisphere at the edge of

2351.2 --> 2354.64
vision

2352.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
surrounding the observer that's how you

2354.64 --> 2358.0
see it

2355.839 --> 2360.72
they don't have a euclidean position

2358.0 --> 2360.72
over the earth

2362.96 --> 2370.0
they just reveal themselves optically

2366.48 --> 2372.16
to observers relating to the specific

2370.0 --> 2373.92
location on the earth because there is a

2372.16 --> 2375.44
correlation between

2373.92 --> 2378.32
how the angular positions of the

2375.44 --> 2382.64
heavenly bodies are in relation to

2378.32 --> 2386.079
that earth position

2382.64 --> 2390.0
and that's it so to

2386.079 --> 2392.079
extract some kind of why

2390.0 --> 2393.92
why can't you see it all well that's

2392.079 --> 2396.0
because you simply don't understand what

2393.92 --> 2399.119
you're looking at

2396.0 --> 2402.48
you're assuming a very primitive

2399.119 --> 2405.6800000000003
literal view of a disc

2402.48 --> 2406.64
with stars hanging over them that's not

2405.68 --> 2409.68
what they are

2406.64 --> 2410.56
that's not how you see that that makes

2409.68 --> 2414.48
no sense

2410.56 --> 2414.48
right that's a straw man assumption

2415.92 --> 2419.92
yeah of course he's a ball tar troll duh

2423.359 --> 2428.02
squirt city all of a sudden

2424.95 --> 2428.02
[Music]

2431.359 --> 2434.96
using my analogy you've seen that fe

2433.44 --> 2438.2400000000002
won't even be

2434.96 --> 2441.92
an accepted model of shape of earth

2438.24 --> 2445.2
isn't it a dead end basically

2441.92 --> 2447.599
no it's a good intro

2445.2 --> 2448.72
it's a good transition intro from the

2447.599 --> 2450.56
globe model

2448.72 --> 2452.48
because people that have learned about

2450.56 --> 2455.7599999999998
the globe have

2452.48 --> 2457.2
been taught about how to think how to

2455.76 --> 2460.4
see those things

2457.2 --> 2463.839
it's very tough to step away

2460.4 --> 2465.6800000000003
from all that to how the way that i've

2463.839 --> 2468.0789999999997
been explaining things right

2465.68 --> 2470.16
because you have a lot of physicality

2468.079 --> 2472.7200000000003
assumption bias to deal with

2470.16 --> 2474.24
and so for that purpose to have a flat

2472.72 --> 2477.52
earth model

2474.24 --> 2479.839
a disc model and even say no the sun

2477.52 --> 2480.96
is three or three thousand miles away

2479.839 --> 2484.319
and it is a thing

2480.96 --> 2487.359
hanging up there over the disc is

2484.319 --> 2489.72
a good way to switch away

2487.359 --> 2491.359
from the galactic imagination of

2489.72 --> 2494.319
heliocentrism

2491.359 --> 2494.7999999999997
but it's only a first step to attain

2494.319 --> 2498.079
further

2494.8 --> 2501.2000000000003
understanding you must discover

2498.079 --> 2504.079
why it's not literally

2501.2 --> 2506.3999999999996
that primitive setup of of the disk with

2504.079 --> 2507.3590000000004
the heavenly bodies hanging over the

2506.4 --> 2509.28
disk

2507.359 --> 2511.68
right and then you can struggle against

2509.28 --> 2513.92
it and try to

2511.68 --> 2515.7599999999998
figure out ways but no this is why

2513.92 --> 2518.64
they're hanging over the disk but still

2515.76 --> 2521.8390000000004
they go beyond the horizon etc etc

2518.64 --> 2523.04
but that's basically what ballers do

2521.839 --> 2525.52
with their ball model

2523.04 --> 2526.16
that's what well flat earth is doing the

2525.52 --> 2530.88
same with

2526.16 --> 2534.0789999999997
that specific reified model

2530.88 --> 2536.0
it's only a natural mistake to make the

2534.079 --> 2537.92
point is is that you got to realize

2536.0 --> 2539.76
that mistake at some point and then try

2537.92 --> 2542.8
to move on

2539.76 --> 2542.8
and that's what i've done

2544.48 --> 2551.359
right so yeah there is a place

2548.4 --> 2553.92
for the disc model with everything

2551.359 --> 2557.119
that's been built with it

2553.92 --> 2559.64
to kind of bypass or postpone

2557.119 --> 2560.88
a lot of the physicality assumption bias

2559.64 --> 2564.0
confrontations

2560.88 --> 2565.6800000000003
right because

2564.0 --> 2567.359
you can't really deal with that with

2565.68 --> 2570.24
somebody that believes in the ball

2567.359 --> 2572.24
and in consensus reality and signs from

2570.24 --> 2574.0
the government etc etc

2572.24 --> 2576.0
as long as they believe in that you

2574.0 --> 2577.68
can't get them to overcome their

2576.0 --> 2579.92
physicality assumption bias

2577.68 --> 2581.7599999999998
you can't get you can't switch their

2579.92 --> 2584.88
imagination that far

2581.76 --> 2588.0
so you have to reroute it into a

2584.88 --> 2592.56
flat disc model to first

2588.0 --> 2595.28
get that feet foot in the door

2592.56 --> 2595.68
and make them used to the realization

2595.28 --> 2598.8
look

2595.68 --> 2601.04
it can be different

2598.8 --> 2603.04
what you've been taught is a lie and

2601.04 --> 2605.2
that takes a lot of time to sink in for

2603.04 --> 2608.319
a lot of people it takes a lot of sweaty

2605.2 --> 2611.4399999999996
sleepless nights and then after that

2608.319 --> 2611.7599999999998
then once they get over that first big

2611.44 --> 2615.04
big

2611.76 --> 2616.96
threshold then you can try to get rid of

2615.04 --> 2619.2799999999997
the physicality assumption by his base

2616.96 --> 2621.2
mistakes

2619.28 --> 2622.88
so the disk model definitely has a

2621.2 --> 2625.2
function within the whole

2622.88 --> 2625.92
in the whole learning process but it's

2625.2 --> 2629.1189999999997
not

2625.92 --> 2635.08
the ultimate truth it is not the model

2629.119 --> 2638.199
that is reality

2635.08 --> 2638.199
[Music]

2642.42 --> 2645.61
[Music]

2661.119 --> 2665.28
all right so again to reaffirm what i

2664.319 --> 2668.56
just said

2665.28 --> 2671.76
in response to pad fee the flat earth

2668.56 --> 2676.16
disk model is not a dead end it's a

2671.76 --> 2691.8390000000004
transition model

2676.16 --> 2691.839
hey stopping traffic in my restaurant

2706.72 --> 2713.68
most likely never be reading mandatory

2710.56 --> 2717.2799999999997
why would you mandate anything

2713.68 --> 2718.64
how about taking away mandatory

2717.28 --> 2722.4
curricula

2718.64 --> 2725.92
how about that pat fee how about just

2722.4 --> 2728.079
leaving it up to the people to decide

2725.92 --> 2729.119
what they want their kids to learn how

2728.079 --> 2733.2000000000003
about that

2729.119 --> 2736.96
right why would anybody ever want to

2733.2 --> 2740.24
mandate a flat earth model in schools

2736.96 --> 2742.64
that's ridiculous i think most flat

2740.24 --> 2745.4399999999996
earthers don't care about that at all

2742.64 --> 2748.16
they'd rather just have the flat earth

2745.44 --> 2751.599
have honest representation

2748.16 --> 2753.68
when the subjects brought up so that

2751.599 --> 2755.6800000000003
flat earthers are not just going to be

2753.68 --> 2757.44
per default be shamed in school when

2755.68 --> 2759.04
they bring it up

2757.44 --> 2760.48
and they can just forward their

2759.04 --> 2763.92
arguments

2760.48 --> 2765.2
against the globe right so it's not

2763.92 --> 2769.119
about mandating

2765.2 --> 2771.4399999999996
it's about allowing things again

2769.119 --> 2773.2000000000003
freedom that's what it's all about

2771.44 --> 2776.16
freedom freedom of mind

2773.2 --> 2778.64
freedom of reason freedom to ask

2776.16 --> 2778.64
questions

2781.599 --> 2789.839
without literally being berated or

2784.24 --> 2789.839
punished for it in school

2800.839 --> 2803.839
right

2818.319 --> 2823.359
there's salt layer above where they

2820.8 --> 2825.6800000000003
shoot lasers and create their own stars

2823.359 --> 2825.68
mate

2825.76 --> 2833.3590000000004
oh what

2830.0 --> 2834.48
salt layers i have no idea what you're

2833.359 --> 2836.7999999999997
talking about

2834.48 --> 2839.28
i have heard about like the ability to

2836.8 --> 2843.2000000000003
create stars using certain types of

2839.28 --> 2845.28
lasers i i reviewed that paper with

2843.2 --> 2848.16
robert shortman in one of my first flat

2845.28 --> 2848.1600000000003
earth talk shows

2848.88 --> 2853.44
i still have the document on my computer

2850.96 --> 2856.559
it is really fascinating but

2853.44 --> 2858.88
i think that it works when they they

2856.559 --> 2864.4
have to actually go there

2858.88 --> 2864.4
and then introduce like an aerosol

2866.319 --> 2873.2
or something or they could like amplify

2869.44 --> 2874.8
a star if they wanted to

2873.2 --> 2876.7999999999997
i don't know it's still kind of weird i

2874.8 --> 2878.8
i'm not going to claim there is literal

2876.8 --> 2882.2400000000002
salt layers anywhere

2878.8 --> 2885.76
although maybe nah no it can be

2882.24 --> 2889.5989999999997
makes no sense right

2885.76 --> 2889.599
the stars are not coming off

2889.76 --> 2896.2400000000002
a dome right

2892.88 --> 2899.119
they're rotating how can you

2896.24 --> 2900.0
contribute with the laser on that

2899.119 --> 2903.119
rotating

2900.0 --> 2904.48
thing that apparently rotating thing by

2903.119 --> 2907.44
shooting at a

2904.48 --> 2910.4
physical euclidean stationary position

2907.44 --> 2913.52
on the dome that makes no sense

2910.4 --> 2917.44
right so

2913.52 --> 2917.44
it's it's different has to be

2924.96 --> 2928.079
ah that's a good one matthias the

2926.4 --> 2931.2000000000003
walking witness good quote

2928.079 --> 2931.2000000000003
from richard feynman

2932.72 --> 2936.8799999999997
i would rather have questions that

2935.2 --> 2943.839
cannot be answered than answers that

2936.88 --> 2943.839
cannot be questions brilliant

2955.119 --> 2971.839
send link what dude

2973.359 --> 2975.92
the [ __ ]

2977.359 --> 2985.839
that's lame

2996.839 --> 2999.839
so

3005.359 --> 3013.839
all right yeah

3014.079 --> 3020.0
richard accepted the shape of the earth

3017.119 --> 3021.44
or didn't really want to address it too

3020.0 --> 3024.559
much

3021.44 --> 3027.2000000000003
right famous was not an idiot

3024.559 --> 3029.2000000000003
he knew there was a globe indoctrination

3027.2 --> 3032.319
program going on

3029.2 --> 3034.8799999999997
right that's what the real scientists do

3032.319 --> 3036.48
they realize okay there is a fooling

3034.88 --> 3038.7200000000003
program going on

3036.48 --> 3039.599
now how can i still do my research and

3038.72 --> 3042.319
development

3039.599 --> 3043.28
bypassing all that nonsense so they have

3042.319 --> 3045.599
to think about okay

3043.28 --> 3046.96
how can i present something that's true

3045.599 --> 3050.48
in the real world

3046.96 --> 3053.28
but also has attachment

3050.48 --> 3055.52
options to the globe model so that

3053.28 --> 3059.119
they're not going to nag me

3055.52 --> 3062.64
and strangle me in a dark alley over it

3059.119 --> 3065.2000000000003
right that's what happens

3062.64 --> 3066.5589999999997
so yeah of course feydman at times would

3065.2 --> 3071.5989999999997
have to like

3066.559 --> 3073.3590000000004
defend globe reasoning and models

3071.599 --> 3083.839
doesn't mean that he actually believed

3073.359 --> 3083.839
in it

3090.319 --> 3096.88
right in my own way i am doing the same

3094.839 --> 3101.7599999999998
thing right

3096.88 --> 3101.76
i maintain globe reasoning

3101.92 --> 3106.319
i keep track of it to a cosmogonical

3104.24 --> 3109.4399999999996
society the big difference though is

3106.319 --> 3112.24
unlike the others in the past i just

3109.44 --> 3114.2400000000002
say right now we're engaging in the

3112.24 --> 3117.2799999999997
globe presuppositional thinking

3114.24 --> 3119.839
in the dynamics of that and then

3117.28 --> 3122.2400000000002
fit this thing into there so i'm just

3119.839 --> 3123.04
publicly doing it i'm not keeping it a

3122.24 --> 3126.4799999999996
secret

3123.04 --> 3129.7599999999998
for the elite for the programmers

3126.48 --> 3130.079
i am taking part in the programming

3129.76 --> 3139.5200000000004
though

3130.079 --> 3143.04
i'm just very clear as to when i do that

3139.52 --> 3145.119
pat fee i don't care like literally

3143.04 --> 3146.4
there's more to this freaking world than

3145.119 --> 3148.559
whether people were

3146.4 --> 3152.64
flat earthers or globers like it

3148.559 --> 3154.6400000000003
literally doesn't matter

3152.64 --> 3158.4
i'm much more interested in what people

3154.64 --> 3162.0
actually had developed

3158.4 --> 3164.079
and how that works like the development

3162.0 --> 3165.119
process how does the development in

3164.079 --> 3170.0
itself work

3165.119 --> 3170.0
how does the learning curve work

3172.88 --> 3180.48
the structure of insight

3176.48 --> 3183.52
how does it grow what are

3180.48 --> 3186.64
universal obstacles along the path

3183.52 --> 3189.68
of ascension right

3186.64 --> 3192.96
who cares whether they it's not gonna

3189.68 --> 3195.1189999999997
bother i'm a flat earther i'm a flat

3192.96 --> 3198.96
earther or no i'm a glober no that's

3195.119 --> 3201.6800000000003
for numpties right that's

3198.96 --> 3202.88
that's for people that use it as an

3201.68 --> 3205.44
excuse to not

3202.88 --> 3206.839
dig further because it becomes tougher

3205.44 --> 3209.839
when you dig

3206.839 --> 3209.839
further

3220.96 --> 3223.839
yep

3230.0 --> 3235.76
you could say all is light no

3233.2 --> 3239.04
physicality

3235.76 --> 3239.0400000000004
concerning the stars

3242.4 --> 3250.48
yes but hey the

3245.44 --> 3252.8
the thing you're standing on the dirt

3250.48 --> 3254.8
that's definitely fit solid that's

3252.8 --> 3258.88
physical

3254.8 --> 3261.3590000000004
but any lights up there nope

3258.88 --> 3265.839
there seems to be no evidence whatsoever

3261.359 --> 3265.839
that they are physical

3267.28 --> 3271.3590000000004
or even have like a euclidean origin

3270.16 --> 3274.0
source

3271.359 --> 3279.839
of the light on top of it all right

3274.0 --> 3279.839
makes it even more complicated

3290.839 --> 3293.839
uh

3296.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
yeah it is jim thomas ellie indeed

3317.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
it is a va i don't know what that means

3364.08 --> 3367.31
[Music]

3371.68 --> 3375.839
so if the stars are just holographic

3373.76 --> 3378.96
what is spectroscopy picking up

3375.839 --> 3379.68
light spectrum right that's what it's

3378.96 --> 3384.319
picking up

3379.68 --> 3388.0
light spectrum spectroscopy

3384.319 --> 3391.839
is a misapplication

3388.0 --> 3395.359
of a system that works on earth

3391.839 --> 3395.839
with spectroscopy they figured out okay

3395.359 --> 3397.68
what

3395.839 --> 3399.119
kind of light comes off certain

3397.68 --> 3402.0
materials like

3399.119 --> 3404.0
and then you can basically identify

3402.0 --> 3406.16
materials just by shining light on them

3404.0 --> 3407.04
it's very interesting very effective

3406.16 --> 3409.359
right

3407.04 --> 3410.88
well as soon as you apply that on light

3409.359 --> 3415.2799999999997
that comes from the heavens

3410.88 --> 3418.48
celestial light then you have to reify

3415.28 --> 3421.0400000000004
that it is material that it

3418.48 --> 3421.839
that is creating it or that it reflects

3421.04 --> 3425.2799999999997
the light

3421.839 --> 3428.319
in order for you to pick it up and then

3425.28 --> 3433.0400000000004
try because it's not really all that

3428.319 --> 3435.68
all that useful try to

3433.04 --> 3437.599
analyze okay it must be this material

3435.68 --> 3438.72
based on this spectrum of light that's

3437.599 --> 3441.119
coming from there

3438.72 --> 3443.2
right so it is a direct reification of a

3441.119 --> 3447.92
physical nature of the celestial

3443.2 --> 3450.0
lights to assume it is matter

3447.92 --> 3452.88
that is reflecting the light in order to

3450.0 --> 3456.0
apply spectroscopy to it

3452.88 --> 3458.96
right so the entire process

3456.0 --> 3460.0
when you apply it to celestial light is

3458.96 --> 3475.839
a reification

3460.0 --> 3475.839
from the outset

3484.559 --> 3489.8390000000004
do i think that ballers are a cult

3492.24 --> 3495.9199999999996
it is a religion it is a very cultish

3495.2 --> 3499.2799999999997
religion

3495.92 --> 3504.2400000000002
that makes you ignore things on purpose

3499.28 --> 3504.2400000000002
tells you how to reason out things

3504.48 --> 3507.2
but yeah

3513.52 --> 3520.96
it is like a cult that carries

3516.64 --> 3523.2
uh like a lot of the mechanism itself is

3520.96 --> 3526.2400000000002
the call

3523.2 --> 3528.319
right so a more old-fashioned call is

3526.24 --> 3529.68
basically just relinquishing your

3528.319 --> 3532.24
authority

3529.68 --> 3535.1189999999997
to an individual and then putting them

3532.24 --> 3538.16
on a huge pedestal like they're godlike

3535.119 --> 3538.6400000000003
then relinquishing your whatever you

3538.16 --> 3541.44
need

3538.64 --> 3543.52
in order to please the leader and then

3541.44 --> 3546.88
they make the rules whatever they are

3543.52 --> 3547.52
and then based on whatever the story

3546.88 --> 3550.7200000000003
they used

3547.52 --> 3551.28
in the offset you're gonna hold them to

3550.72 --> 3555.68
that

3551.28 --> 3555.6800000000003
right two basic called principles

3556.319 --> 3559.92
but with the ball religion it's

3558.319 --> 3565.44
different because there is a

3559.92 --> 3569.52
priest handing you data down

3565.44 --> 3572.559
but they are messing it up on purpose

3569.52 --> 3573.92
so because of that it's like a cult

3572.559 --> 3577.28
without a leader

3573.92 --> 3580.4
and the mechanism itself which is built

3577.28 --> 3583.76
by the cult members is

3580.4 --> 3588.64
the leader it's the dream

3583.76 --> 3588.6400000000003
of heliocentrism that is the leader

3589.52 --> 3592.799
and that's why you have trenchers that

3591.28 --> 3596.2400000000002
basically

3592.799 --> 3597.52
bypass top-down priesthood statements

3596.24 --> 3600.319
and arguments

3597.52 --> 3602.48
and have their own trencher narrative

3600.319 --> 3605.68
their own part of the dream they work

3602.48 --> 3609.2
on they build

3605.68 --> 3612.16
the dream the dream is the leader

3609.2 --> 3613.2
it is the objective it's like a working

3612.16 --> 3617.5989999999997
man's

3613.2 --> 3620.64
religion the religion is to build it

3617.599 --> 3622.6400000000003
to reinforce it to spread it the idea

3620.64 --> 3626.839
around to convince everybody that it

3622.64 --> 3629.839
is the leader right the dream is the

3626.839 --> 3629.839
leader

3675.76 --> 3679.44
you hate enjoying football

3680.079 --> 3685.8390000000004
why if you like it you like it

3695.68 --> 3699.7599999999998
it's interesting that randy referred to

3697.839 --> 3700.64
atheists called you really you think so

3699.76 --> 3703.76
you think it's

3700.64 --> 3707.359
interesting that he did that no it's

3703.76 --> 3710.48
just a logical next step

3707.359 --> 3715.359
to say that in his projection

3710.48 --> 3718.4
right of course ballers in chat

3715.359 --> 3720.64
all that for years keep telling

3718.4 --> 3723.92
everybody oh the flat earth is dying

3720.64 --> 3723.92
it's all just a cult

3724.64 --> 3727.839
they've been saying that for years

3729.039 --> 3733.28
how is it interesting that ranty says

3738.839 --> 3741.839
that

3742.079 --> 3746.2400000000002
hey stallion 8012 yeah i'm doing great

3747.839 --> 3751.7599999999998
that's right roof and st hubbins he did

3752.079 --> 3755.8390000000004
no snowbirds

3765.359 --> 3783.52
nathan is called like yeah yeah i know

3769.2 --> 3785.68
i know everybody wants to think that

3783.52 --> 3786.72
he also said that it was a cult without

3785.68 --> 3789.839
a leader

3786.72 --> 3789.839
that makes no sense

3794.48 --> 3798.0
there's not some kind of specific dream

3796.48 --> 3800.72
we're defending

3798.0 --> 3801.92
like most of the people in the flat

3800.72 --> 3804.0
earth debates that

3801.92 --> 3807.76
regularly partake in it they have their

3804.0 --> 3807.76
own thing they're working on

3808.0 --> 3812.48
right and sometimes their ideas take

3810.319 --> 3814.24
them to places that contradicts where

3812.48 --> 3817.119
other people have taken their ideas

3814.24 --> 3819.52
especially this happened in the earlier

3817.119 --> 3820.1600000000003
years of the flat earth debate people

3819.52 --> 3823.839
were just

3820.16 --> 3827.0389999999998
thinking wildly in all directions

3823.839 --> 3838.0789999999997
conflicting about a lot of things

3827.039 --> 3840.079
right so how is it a cult exactly

3838.079 --> 3842.559
all right in a cult there's really no

3840.079 --> 3846.48
room for disagreement

3842.559 --> 3849.6800000000003
that's the point of a cult right

3846.48 --> 3853.119
like at all people are not going to look

3849.68 --> 3856.72
for things to disagree upon in a cult

3853.119 --> 3856.7200000000003
that's not what a cult is

3859.2 --> 3864.72
you don't seek out conflict in a cult no

3861.68 --> 3881.839
you only work to reaffirm

3864.72 --> 3881.839
the narrative the dream

3887.28 --> 3892.3190000000004
claiming we have two or three sons

3890.0 --> 3896.0
really who is claiming that rufus

3892.319 --> 3898.4
who is claiming that yeah

3896.0 --> 3899.28
let me lay down my claim about the sun

3898.4 --> 3904.0
we have

3899.28 --> 3907.76
zero suns right we don't have a sun

3904.0 --> 3909.92
yeah we see the sun disk right

3907.76 --> 3910.96
when nothing is obstructing the daylight

3909.92 --> 3914.0
manifest

3910.96 --> 3916.0
we don't have a sun zero sun so this

3914.0 --> 3918.16
stupid oh look there's some

3916.0 --> 3920.16
visual other thing we're seeing so

3918.16 --> 3921.2
there's another song that must be the

3920.16 --> 3924.24
real song

3921.2 --> 3925.1189999999997
it's all pointless all pointless it's

3924.24 --> 3928.0789999999997
all

3925.119 --> 3928.7200000000003
trying to desperately find some way back

3928.079 --> 3931.8390000000004
to a

3928.72 --> 3933.2799999999997
physical object known as the sun that

3931.839 --> 3936.96
have been poured into us

3933.28 --> 3940.4
endlessly through helios

3936.96 --> 3943.52
reification indoctrination right

3940.4 --> 3944.4
people want their ball back even on a

3943.52 --> 3947.7599999999998
flat earth

3944.4 --> 3949.839
people want that ball sun

3947.76 --> 3951.599
back they want it back so they're gonna

3949.839 --> 3952.64
look well what if this isn't the real

3951.599 --> 3954.96
thing and what is it

3952.64 --> 3956.72
oh oh look another apparition oh that

3954.96 --> 3957.44
must be the real thing so there is a

3956.72 --> 3960.5589999999997
real sun

3957.44 --> 3964.559
out there a ball of fire somewhere or

3960.559 --> 3968.1600000000003
electrical something no there is zero

3964.559 --> 3972.2400000000002
zero zero zero sun no sun

3968.16 --> 3974.5589999999997
there is no sun that thing you thought

3972.24 --> 3975.359
was a ball of fire a big light source

3974.559 --> 3977.8390000000004
physically

3975.359 --> 3979.2
present somewhere in the realm it

3977.839 --> 3982.5589999999997
doesn't exist

3979.2 --> 3986.96
that's a myth that's a dream

3982.559 --> 3993.8390000000004
an illusion put into your mind

3986.96 --> 3993.839
countless generations

3998.88 --> 4002.6400000000003
oh factor 50 sunscreen bags today for oh

4001.76 --> 4004.559
yeah well

4002.64 --> 4006.0
that's actually light being absorbed by

4004.559 --> 4008.88
your skin yeah that's

4006.0 --> 4009.52
not proof there is a physical sun

4008.88 --> 4012.079
anywhere

4009.52 --> 4012.72
yeah you have no proof it's actually

4012.079 --> 4015.44
coming

4012.72 --> 4017.7599999999998
from that what you think is an object in

4015.44 --> 4020.96
the sky

4017.76 --> 4023.039
i say that perceived object which isn't

4020.96 --> 4025.28
an object it's an apparition a purely

4023.039 --> 4028.3190000000004
light based holographic side effect

4025.28 --> 4028.96
is just that a side effect it's a side

4028.319 --> 4032.839
effect

4028.96 --> 4034.0
to the daylight manifest you see it as a

4032.839 --> 4037.7599999999998
signature

4034.0 --> 4040.4
in your position the edge of vision

4037.76 --> 4041.28
exactly coinciding with the direction

4040.4 --> 4045.28
the daylight

4041.28 --> 4048.48
is manifesting from angular wise

4045.28 --> 4050.079
towards the observer that is what it is

4048.48 --> 4053.839
it's secondary there is

4050.079 --> 4057.2000000000003
no sun doesn't exist

4053.839 --> 4060.319
there is no object up there giving

4057.2 --> 4062.0
off light like a lamp in order for you

4060.319 --> 4066.319
to receive it and have

4062.0 --> 4066.319
require sunscreen yeah

4066.88 --> 4072.559
you have no proof that there is there's

4069.92 --> 4076.0
no proof there's no

4072.559 --> 4078.079
physical nature proof to the sun

4076.0 --> 4080.16
whatsoever the only thing you have to

4078.079 --> 4082.2400000000002
fall back on is the presupposition that

4080.16 --> 4084.0
it is a lamp it's sending out light and

4082.24 --> 4084.8799999999997
you're absorbing that light so it must

4084.0 --> 4087.76
be a lamp

4084.88 --> 4089.44
that's basically your claim here right

4087.76 --> 4092.1600000000003
there's no confirmation that it is a

4089.44 --> 4095.28
physical thing whatsoever

4092.16 --> 4096.48
quite the contrary yeah hologram that's

4095.28 --> 4099.679
right battery

4096.48 --> 4102.879999999999
hologram hologram

4099.679 --> 4105.359
zero sun it's a hologram it's a

4102.88 --> 4108.319
light based image that's literally what

4105.359 --> 4108.319
hologram means

4109.52 --> 4119.839000000001
hollow light gram picture

4112.96 --> 4119.839
picture of light

4122.88 --> 4128.0
the sun itself acts as a reflected

4125.6 --> 4129.04
source of light oh really reflected you

4128.0 --> 4132.64
say

4129.04 --> 4135.199
so you're claiming a physical origin

4132.64 --> 4135.679
a start out point for the light in order

4135.199 --> 4138.08
for

4135.679 --> 4139.52
something to reflect it do you andrew

4138.08 --> 4141.5199999999995
what's your evidence for that

4139.52 --> 4144.4800000000005
where's the reflector where's the origin

4141.52 --> 4147.92
source how do you trace it

4144.48 --> 4149.759
let's approach this big lamp let's let's

4147.92 --> 4152.799
get there

4149.759 --> 4155.679
let's see an angular size change

4152.799 --> 4156.64
of a source for this light in order to

4155.679 --> 4159.04
to

4156.64 --> 4161.839
get a hint that it has a physical nature

4159.04 --> 4161.839
of some sort

4172.96 --> 4177.359
what does that have to do with anything

4174.719 --> 4177.359
matthias

4181.44 --> 4185.599999999999
where does the light come from it

4183.44 --> 4187.919999999999
manifests

4185.6 --> 4190.319
it doesn't come from anywhere it just

4187.92 --> 4193.359
comes into being

4190.319 --> 4196.719
there's something obviously feeding it

4193.359 --> 4199.1990000000005
the energy in order for it to manifest

4196.719 --> 4200.4800000000005
but it's non-local it doesn't come from

4199.199 --> 4203.678999999999
anywhere

4200.48 --> 4206.799999999999
it just manifests holographically

4203.679 --> 4208.88
unique to the position

4206.8 --> 4210.8
like the entire light spectrum of

4208.88 --> 4214.400000000001
everything you see

4210.8 --> 4216.719
it's a unique holographic manifestation

4214.4 --> 4217.759999999999
specific to the observer's exact

4216.719 --> 4221.04
position

4217.76 --> 4224.08
so basically every position on earth has

4221.04 --> 4226.719
like a well non-local

4224.08 --> 4228.32
light pattern that it is being that the

4226.719 --> 4231.44
earth is being subjected to

4228.32 --> 4234.88
it's just that if you have eyes then

4231.44 --> 4238.159
that seems to cause you to

4234.88 --> 4239.1990000000005
have a specific location from which the

4238.159 --> 4243.12
daylight

4239.199 --> 4245.759999999999
direction is manifesting yeah

4243.12 --> 4248.719
it's all holographic none of it is in an

4245.76 --> 4248.719
actual location

4248.8 --> 4252.4800000000005
spread out all over the place

4253.52 --> 4257.4400000000005
because yeah one position you see the

4256.08 --> 4260.4
sun

4257.44 --> 4261.919999999999
in the sky it casts shadows and

4260.4 --> 4265.92
everything and all kinds of things

4261.92 --> 4268.4
and then you go like 10 20 miles away

4265.92 --> 4270.2390000000005
and then you look at that location you

4268.4 --> 4273.28
first look at the sun from

4270.239 --> 4274.32
and the shadows it was casting you zoom

4273.28 --> 4277.599999999999
in on it oh

4274.32 --> 4278.639999999999
it's completely different no there is no

4277.6 --> 4280.8
shadows now

4278.64 --> 4282.400000000001
in that location from the sun because to

4280.8 --> 4284.96
the other 20 mile away

4282.4 --> 4286.32
location the sun is in a different

4284.96 --> 4288.32
angular position

4286.32 --> 4289.92
and it doesn't cast those shadows

4288.32 --> 4292.5599999999995
anymore on those

4289.92 --> 4293.28
objects even though the person in that

4292.56 --> 4296.64
location

4293.28 --> 4299.44
is looking at say those clouds and

4296.64 --> 4300.88
yeah the sun from their vantage point is

4299.44 --> 4304.0
casting the shadows

4300.88 --> 4307.28
yeah that's why it's holographic yeah

4304.0 --> 4310.8
makes it very very surreal

4307.28 --> 4315.84
yeah surreal but real because that's

4310.8 --> 4315.84
how it works

4317.45 --> 4320.648999999999
[Music]

4324.87 --> 4328.1089999999995
[Music]

4328.4 --> 4333.36
holographic based photosynthesis why

4333.52 --> 4340.4800000000005
why would that be interesting it already

4336.56 --> 4344.320000000001
is holographic based photosynthesis yeah

4340.48 --> 4344.32
sunlight is holographic

4344.4 --> 4348.639999999999
and when you photosynthesize it through

4346.719 --> 4352.2390000000005
solar panels

4348.64 --> 4354.88
you are photosynthesizing holographic

4352.239 --> 4354.879999999999
based light

4357.92 --> 4371.84
that's already happening

4376.0 --> 4379.679
100 in conjunction with the reflection

4379.04 --> 4385.12
that's

4379.679 --> 4386.719
very cute but that's all

4385.12 --> 4390.48
i have no proof of that right

4386.719 --> 4390.4800000000005
correlation is not a causation

4396.56 --> 4402.88
right yes when we make holograms

4399.84 --> 4405.28
it requires reflections that's what how

4402.88 --> 4408.08
holograms can be created here on earth

4405.28 --> 4408.96
but you know why that is because we can

4408.08 --> 4411.12
only create

4408.96 --> 4412.64
light sources that are physical and

4411.12 --> 4416.08
euclidean

4412.64 --> 4419.52
in order to fabricate using reflectors

4416.08 --> 4422.96
a hologram right

4419.52 --> 4423.4400000000005
that thing out there doesn't seem to

4422.96 --> 4428.56
really

4423.44 --> 4430.799999999999
requiring it the celestialite don't have

4428.56 --> 4432.4800000000005
a there's no proof that they have a

4430.8 --> 4434.96
physical light origin

4432.48 --> 4437.12
right so if you want to lay that claim

4434.96 --> 4440.159
yeah when you have a hologram creator

4437.12 --> 4442.4
you can literally just open it up figure

4440.159 --> 4444.239
out ah here is it coming from right so

4442.4 --> 4445.599999999999
then you turn off this light oh the

4444.239 --> 4449.12
hologram fails

4445.6 --> 4452.56
it breaks up right very manipulate

4449.12 --> 4455.92
yeah you you blot it out

4452.56 --> 4460.64
as it goes towards the hologram

4455.92 --> 4462.56
result oh try and do that

4460.64 --> 4464.56
right if you actually want to have a

4462.56 --> 4467.04
claim that there is

4464.56 --> 4468.56
a physical light source in the euclidean

4467.04 --> 4470.96
position

4468.56 --> 4473.679
then sending out its light that is being

4470.96 --> 4475.52
reflected somehow into the holographic

4473.679 --> 4478.64
display that we see

4475.52 --> 4481.84
well blot it out then

4478.64 --> 4482.400000000001
universally shouldn't be too difficult

4481.84 --> 4485.52
well

4482.4 --> 4489.759999999999
depending on if it's in reach etc etc

4485.52 --> 4489.76
but all of this is just a bunch of myth

4492.8 --> 4496.28
right and if you're gonna hold on to

4494.32 --> 4499.92
that then that is

4496.28 --> 4502.32
physicality assumption bias you assume

4499.92 --> 4504.96
something because you can't imagine it

4502.32 --> 4508.4
could be anything else

4504.96 --> 4512.4
right despite the utter lack of evidence

4508.4 --> 4514.48
for it there is no evidence

4512.4 --> 4517.599999999999
that it is being reflected any of the

4514.48 --> 4519.678999999999
celestial lights there is no evidence

4517.6 --> 4521.04
that what you're seeing is due to some

4519.679 --> 4523.28
kind of mirrory

4521.04 --> 4525.76
reflection even though that might be the

4523.28 --> 4529.04
only thing you can imagine about it

4525.76 --> 4533.12
at this point that's not my problem

4529.04 --> 4533.12
i'd prefer to go by the evidence

4536.84 --> 4539.84
available

4542.08 --> 4548.48
a dome andrew you say a dome so what's

4545.44 --> 4550.239
your evidence that this dome you're

4548.48 --> 4553.839999999999
utilizing

4550.239 --> 4553.839999999999
a light source

4554.0 --> 4557.84
within the dome oh so then it has to be

4556.4 --> 4561.28
within there

4557.84 --> 4562.0
right right so if there is a euclidean

4561.28 --> 4566.0
position

4562.0 --> 4569.44
actual light reflecting

4566.0 --> 4570.0
to create the display we see where is it

4569.44 --> 4573.04
then

4570.0 --> 4575.84
let's approach that euclidean based

4573.04 --> 4578.48
origin position for all that light then

4575.84 --> 4580.32
yeah why don't you do that why hasn't it

4578.48 --> 4595.839999999999
been done

4580.32 --> 4595.84
why can't you approach anything

4601.76 --> 4608.0
no no

4604.88 --> 4611.04
you have no evidence photo mixture

4608.0 --> 4611.04
you have no evidence

4617.76 --> 4627.84
i'm sorry if that that insight deranges

4622.0 --> 4627.84
you in order to start at humming

4632.8 --> 4637.84
you have no evidence this the sun is

4634.84 --> 4637.84
real

4649.52 --> 4652.0
what the

4660.159 --> 4665.839999999999
wow yeah pad feet you no

4672.0 --> 4678.159
yeah no but aurora borealis whatever

4675.44 --> 4681.199
that is it's probably magnetic

4678.159 --> 4684.639999999999
it's not coming from up there

4681.199 --> 4684.639999999999
it's coming from down here

4685.84 --> 4694.0
and i'm i'm sure that

4690.0 --> 4696.0
the sunlight interacts with it

4694.0 --> 4698.32
causing it to basically light up like

4696.0 --> 4700.56
that plasma-like sighting

4698.32 --> 4702.48
right because it is a local thing right

4700.56 --> 4706.56
the holographic

4702.48 --> 4710.4
sun is not local but those

4706.56 --> 4713.04
magnetic the apparitions

4710.4 --> 4714.32
of the what is the aurora borealis they

4713.04 --> 4716.4
are local

4714.32 --> 4721.84
those are actually physical things in

4716.4 --> 4721.839999999999
physical places that you can approach

4746.84 --> 4749.84
so

4750.96 --> 4756.159
what what is the walking

4754.48 --> 4763.839999999999
who are you addressing this is getting

4756.159 --> 4763.839999999999
kind of scattered the chat

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4788.239 --> 4791.36
where's the evidence for a holographic

4790.159 --> 4794.48
sun

4791.36 --> 4797.12
well it's light isn't it can you

4794.48 --> 4800.0
approach it

4797.12 --> 4801.84
no but you still see it well then it's

4800.0 --> 4803.92
an image of light

4801.84 --> 4805.360000000001
that's my evidence the evidence are in

4803.92 --> 4808.4
the word itself

4805.36 --> 4809.679
holographic right if you would like to

4808.4 --> 4812.719
contrast that

4809.679 --> 4815.92
with something else as in pretty much

4812.719 --> 4818.159
the only other option for a nature which

4815.92 --> 4821.36
is non-holographic physical

4818.159 --> 4823.839999999999
then please deliver me the proof

4821.36 --> 4826.159
that it is physical by applying

4823.84 --> 4828.639
perspective

4826.159 --> 4830.839999999999
see the angular size difference when you

4828.639 --> 4833.28
approach it

4830.84 --> 4834.719
right have some evidence that it

4833.28 --> 4839.199
actually abides to

4834.719 --> 4842.32
physical nature in its position

4839.199 --> 4844.32
and then we can start if you bring some

4842.32 --> 4847.04
evidence for that you then we might

4844.32 --> 4849.199
start to refute a holographic nature

4847.04 --> 4850.719
yeah as long as you don't have any

4849.199 --> 4852.96
evidence at all

4850.719 --> 4854.4
that it has a euclidean position like a

4852.96 --> 4856.2390000000005
physical lamp

4854.4 --> 4858.32
i'm going to stick to holographic

4856.239 --> 4859.44
because yeah if there's no evidence for

4858.32 --> 4862.639
physicality

4859.44 --> 4865.28
it's an image of light holographic a

4862.639 --> 4865.28
hologram

4871.12 --> 4874.96
sun's particles what sun particle

4873.679 --> 4877.04
there's sunlight

4874.96 --> 4878.08
and i'm sure the sunlight has a direct

4877.04 --> 4881.5199999999995
influence

4878.08 --> 4881.5199999999995
on whatever is taking place

4881.84 --> 4885.28
at the location where the aurora

4883.679 --> 4888.32
borealis comes up

4885.28 --> 4890.4
right but the aurora borealis is a local

4888.32 --> 4892.4
phenomena it's probably like plasma or

4890.4 --> 4895.759999999999
something

4892.4 --> 4897.28
through magnetism in combination with

4895.76 --> 4898.159000000001
sunlight interaction because the

4897.28 --> 4900.32
sunlight

4898.159 --> 4903.839999999999
the light is still manifesting it's

4900.32 --> 4903.84
still doing things

4912.8 --> 4917.84
no [ __ ] off

4924.4 --> 4928.159
it's very simple for anybody that might

4927.12 --> 4931.04
be wondering

4928.159 --> 4931.759999999999
i'm not related to anyone you've ever

4931.04 --> 4935.84
heard of

4931.76 --> 4939.12
ever okay never unless you may be in the

4935.84 --> 4940.639
music world of some sort and then you

4939.12 --> 4943.92
might have heard of my mother

4940.639 --> 4944.4800000000005
that's it i'm not related to anybody

4943.92 --> 4947.679
you've

4944.48 --> 4949.678999999999
ever heard of so never ask again it's

4947.679 --> 4951.679
stupid and it is annoying as [ __ ] and

4949.679 --> 4952.08
i'm gonna take you for a troll and ban

4951.679 --> 4956.32
you

4952.08 --> 4959.44
immediately yeah you don't have to ask

4956.32 --> 4973.84
i'm not related to anybody you've

4959.44 --> 4973.839999999999
ever heard of it's that simple

4990.639 --> 4995.12
making faces at the camera is that proof

4997.92 --> 5001.84
what has that got to do with anything

5005.36 --> 5009.28
i what his face has got to do with it

5008.159 --> 5014.32
laird of the

5009.28 --> 5020.08
trap brain

5014.32 --> 5023.04
i i make faces to emphasize my points

5020.08 --> 5023.76
my faces aren't the points unless you

5023.04 --> 5026.0
need to

5023.76 --> 5027.6
clean out those ears and actually listen

5026.0 --> 5031.12
to what i was saying

5027.6 --> 5033.360000000001
because i was addressing what you said

5031.12 --> 5034.96
right it's not the faces that are the

5033.36 --> 5037.92
point it's what i said

5034.96 --> 5037.92
that was the point

5038.08 --> 5043.28
sorry if you can't handle it

5041.28 --> 5044.32
sorry i have to take away that ball of

5043.28 --> 5047.12
you again

5044.32 --> 5048.239
yeah all those balls you think you had

5047.12 --> 5049.84
the marbles

5048.239 --> 5052.08
you thought you had because you were

5049.84 --> 5053.92
convinced those are real you're standing

5052.08 --> 5054.4
on a marble and there's marbles in the

5053.92 --> 5056.88
sky

5054.4 --> 5057.5199999999995
everywhere yeah i'm taking it away all

5056.88 --> 5061.6
of it

5057.52 --> 5064.159000000001
all of it there are no marbles

5061.6 --> 5067.1990000000005
you're not standing on a marble you're

5064.159 --> 5071.839999999999
not looking at a marble

5067.199 --> 5071.839999999999
you don't have any marbles left

5073.52 --> 5078.320000000001
and then you're not getting them back

5074.96 --> 5085.84
either once you realize they don't exist

5078.32 --> 5085.84
you're not gonna get them back

5125.92 --> 5130.2390000000005
above the container matthias you have no

5128.96 --> 5131.84
evidence

5130.239 --> 5133.599999999999
you don't even know what the container

5131.84 --> 5136.8
is what the shape of it is

5133.6 --> 5140.88
nothing this is all

5136.8 --> 5143.679
just pure speculation

5140.88 --> 5145.679
specified model based foundational

5143.679 --> 5146.4
speculation you don't have anything of

5145.679 --> 5149.52
any of it

5146.4 --> 5149.5199999999995
evidence for any of it

5150.88 --> 5157.1990000000005
you have no evidence for activity

5154.159 --> 5158.799999999999
outside of the dome that you assume in

5157.199 --> 5159.12
the process there's no evidence that

5158.8 --> 5162.2390000000005
there

5159.12 --> 5163.84
is an actual physical barrier that is

5162.239 --> 5165.919999999999
physical in nature with something

5163.84 --> 5168.08
outside of it you have no evidence for

5165.92 --> 5170.88
this at all

5168.08 --> 5171.6
you don't have a evidence for an actual

5170.88 --> 5174.8
shape

5171.6 --> 5176.2390000000005
of the containment at all there's no

5174.8 --> 5183.6
evidence that it is a dome

5176.239 --> 5186.0
that it is dome-shaped at all

5183.6 --> 5186.0
all right

5186.639 --> 5197.84
that's fine

5210.88 --> 5213.4400000000005
oh really

5217.52 --> 5220.88
but you set it right there

5222.239 --> 5225.839999999999
above the container

5231.44 --> 5239.839999999999
waterfall what oh okay

5234.96 --> 5239.84
you said container not dumb my apologies

5247.199 --> 5253.199
i yeah when i'm reading that back i

5251.679 --> 5255.4400000000005
don't really understand even what you

5253.199 --> 5255.44
meant

5260.96 --> 5265.52
the dome is an energy field well might

5263.92 --> 5268.88
be

5265.52 --> 5272.159000000001
right if there is some kind of well

5268.88 --> 5273.92
tangible barrier even if it's not made

5272.159 --> 5275.839999999999
of material then maybe there is some

5273.92 --> 5281.84
kind of energy shield i've speculated

5275.84 --> 5281.84
about this too

5282.08 --> 5286.4
right there might be a energy field

5284.239 --> 5288.239
container within the wider realm that

5286.4 --> 5290.879999999999
surrounds us

5288.239 --> 5292.159
that surrounds our specific realm to

5290.88 --> 5294.719
basically

5292.159 --> 5296.48
cut it off from the rest of the realm

5294.719 --> 5298.4800000000005
that's what's around us

5296.48 --> 5301.04
that could be the case doesn't

5298.48 --> 5308.879999999999
necessarily have to be the case

5301.04 --> 5312.88
it might be an option

5308.88 --> 5312.88
the sun admits heat no it doesn't

5313.28 --> 5316.96
what's your proof of proximity heat dal

5315.6 --> 5319.280000000001
zach hunt

5316.96 --> 5320.639
give me some evidence where did you

5319.28 --> 5324.0
actually measure

5320.639 --> 5327.04
the heat like

5324.0 --> 5328.56
getting higher as you approach it i

5327.04 --> 5331.76
don't think so

5328.56 --> 5336.159000000001
only heat proof you have is daylight

5331.76 --> 5338.08
sunlight being absorbed right

5336.159 --> 5339.839999999999
but that's not the same as like

5338.08 --> 5342.159
radiation heat

5339.84 --> 5343.4400000000005
like of a radiator a non-lamp thing that

5342.159 --> 5345.759999999999
gives off heat

5343.44 --> 5346.96
right when you get closer to it it gets

5345.76 --> 5348.88
warmer

5346.96 --> 5350.2390000000005
then you get very close and gets very

5348.88 --> 5352.32
warm right

5350.239 --> 5355.44
that's not the type of evidence you have

5352.32 --> 5365.84
concerning the heat of the sun

5355.44 --> 5365.839999999999
that's not what you got

5374.32 --> 5382.0
the star wars sdn that i wouldn't

5377.76 --> 5382.0
jump to that conclusion too quickly

5386.32 --> 5393.92
i feel heat from the sun no you don't

5390.8 --> 5397.12
the heat you're feeling is the daylight

5393.92 --> 5399.12
being absorbed by your skin

5397.12 --> 5400.719
that creates heat that's where the heat

5399.12 --> 5403.679
is at it's within the

5400.719 --> 5404.639
light manifestation that's not proximity

5403.679 --> 5409.28
heat

5404.639 --> 5413.04
to a heat radiating object

5409.28 --> 5417.12
right that's the light

5413.04 --> 5419.6
manifesting and then being absorbed

5417.12 --> 5420.8
and that's how you experience heat from

5419.6 --> 5422.8
the sun

5420.8 --> 5425.28
it's actually heat from the absorption

5422.8 --> 5435.84
of the light

5425.28 --> 5435.84
it's not proximity heat

5446.84 --> 5449.84
so

5450.8 --> 5454.8
okay matthias the walking witness right

5453.199 --> 5459.36
okay well a multiple

5454.8 --> 5463.360000000001
layer like a oceanic circulatory system

5459.36 --> 5466.239
is an interesting concept

5463.36 --> 5468.239
like that's like rome functionality

5466.239 --> 5470.959999999999
dynamics it's interesting to think about

5468.239 --> 5475.44
those types of things

5470.96 --> 5478.32
however like you have to realize

5475.44 --> 5481.839999999999
that in all the wider research the

5478.32 --> 5481.84
oceans weren't always here

5485.84 --> 5489.6
there was always some water but not in

5488.56 --> 5492.88
the quantities

5489.6 --> 5497.120000000001
there is right now due to well

5492.88 --> 5500.08
what is generally called the great flood

5497.12 --> 5501.76
letting in a lot of water apparently

5500.08 --> 5506.32
coming from above

5501.76 --> 5506.320000000001
and then eventually it drains off again

5516.84 --> 5519.84
somehow

5526.48 --> 5534.959999999999
sun heating is local position of the sun

5530.84 --> 5540.56
no no but

5534.96 --> 5540.56
heated by ground from radiant energy

5541.44 --> 5544.638999999999
right well the the air yes the air heats

5544.239 --> 5546.879999999999
up

5544.639 --> 5548.159000000001
from radiant heat from the ground that

5546.88 --> 5551.4400000000005
is correct

5548.159 --> 5555.36
because air has no

5551.44 --> 5556.08
yeah no is transparent so it doesn't

5555.36 --> 5558.159
absorb

5556.08 --> 5560.4
the light that manifests through it

5558.159 --> 5561.599999999999
that's correct so the air itself is

5560.4 --> 5564.0
heated

5561.6 --> 5565.679
by radiant heat from the ground but the

5564.0 --> 5569.92
ground

5565.679 --> 5572.96
opaque material it does absorb the heat

5569.92 --> 5575.84
from the light manifest

5572.96 --> 5575.84
that's correct

5579.92 --> 5589.84
don't talk like that

5614.84 --> 5617.84
so

5623.52 --> 5625.84
hmm

5629.44 --> 5634.32
oh i forgot about that matthias the

5631.6 --> 5634.320000000001
walking witness

5634.56 --> 5639.92
look but dude at this point it's all

5637.6 --> 5643.120000000001
without evidence all of it

5639.92 --> 5648.2390000000005
right i just try not to dwell

5643.12 --> 5648.239
upon these specific tie down

5654.26 --> 5659.84
[Music]

5656.84 --> 5659.84
cosmogenes

5662.4 --> 5664.96
hold on

5667.92 --> 5674.159
all right all right uh

5671.679 --> 5674.8
but yeah it could be it could be that

5674.159 --> 5677.5199999999995
there is

5674.8 --> 5678.96
like a realm compartmentalization and

5677.52 --> 5680.0
that there is another place where there

5678.96 --> 5683.36
is water above

5680.0 --> 5683.36
now how does it get there

5684.239 --> 5687.919999999999
does it like eventually run out

5686.159 --> 5689.5199999999995
completely and then it's all dried up

5687.92 --> 5691.04
and then all the water is down here is

5689.52 --> 5695.6
there compartment beneath

5691.04 --> 5695.6
us well we don't know all these details

5698.96 --> 5706.719
oh there is supposedly big water caverns

5702.56 --> 5708.400000000001
even very down below with very pure

5706.719 --> 5711.6
water and all that

5708.4 --> 5713.119
but yeah where does it go like is there

5711.6 --> 5717.04
a definitive

5713.119 --> 5720.239
physical separated bottom to the realm

5717.04 --> 5723.92
or does it loop in

5720.239 --> 5726.959999999999
back on top is there a water

5723.92 --> 5728.159
recycling system that fashion that yeah

5726.96 --> 5730.56
the flood water

5728.159 --> 5731.28
was built up then it came pouring into

5730.56 --> 5734.4800000000005
the realm

5731.28 --> 5737.199
then it went down

5734.48 --> 5738.48
and then from that downward position

5737.199 --> 5741.119
builds back up

5738.48 --> 5742.959999999999
to where it started that could be a

5741.119 --> 5746.08
possibility

5742.96 --> 5748.159
can't exclude it especially if there is

5746.08 --> 5749.92
spatial non-linearity going on within

5748.159 --> 5752.48
the realm and there is a loop

5749.92 --> 5754.56
because if there's one loop then the

5752.48 --> 5757.678999999999
whole thing could be looping

5754.56 --> 5760.639
in every direction

5757.679 --> 5760.639
can't exclude it

5761.76 --> 5771.84
at least not yet

5818.56 --> 5822.639
gary i'm talking to a light in this guy

5820.96 --> 5824.84
see what gets you

5822.639 --> 5827.36
well who knows right it is an energy

5824.84 --> 5830.159000000001
manifest

5827.36 --> 5832.32
so maybe your spirit can actually

5830.159 --> 5837.04
resonate with that field

5832.32 --> 5841.84
to manifest so yeah maybe

5837.04 --> 5841.84
it does work

5845.44 --> 5849.28
i like pink floyd not really

5850.639 --> 5855.119
how are solar eclipses predicted so well

5853.84 --> 5858.719
and what are they

5855.119 --> 5861.48
i don't know i don't even

5858.719 --> 5862.639
technically know how the light is

5861.48 --> 5866.32
manifesting

5862.639 --> 5869.76
holographically as it is so how

5866.32 --> 5873.44
why eclipses that's just

5869.76 --> 5873.4400000000005
i have no idea

5873.76 --> 5880.320000000001
one holographic field

5877.119 --> 5880.32
negating another

5881.679 --> 5885.92
right maybe it is like a white noise

5883.52 --> 5885.92
effect

5889.92 --> 5894.4800000000005
that's very rough comparison but it's

5892.0 --> 5897.84
just eclipses with the actual

5894.48 --> 5900.32
what is that is is kind of beyond me at

5897.84 --> 5900.32
this point

5901.199 --> 5906.719
but maybe it is like a maybe such things

5904.08 --> 5908.8
are even possible with holographics

5906.719 --> 5911.04
i don't know i'm not a technological

5908.8 --> 5914.4800000000005
expert at the holographic technology but

5911.04 --> 5916.56
maybe you can actually do such things

5914.48 --> 5918.159
the holograms of a specific type of

5916.56 --> 5920.159000000001
light nature

5918.159 --> 5922.08
and that if you like put them through

5920.159 --> 5923.04
one another they cancel each other out

5922.08 --> 5925.84
or something

5923.04 --> 5925.84
who knows

5964.84 --> 5967.84
so

5978.84 --> 5981.84
hmm

5988.0 --> 5995.119
yes rufus said hobbins it it does it is

5991.52 --> 5998.639
and besides it's super mysterious

5995.119 --> 5998.639
and usually people

5998.96 --> 6002.4800000000005
what they fear and they don't understand

6001.199 --> 6006.0
and when they can't do

6002.48 --> 6007.119
anything about it when the thing they

6006.0 --> 6010.719
fear don't understand

6007.119 --> 6012.719
is immutable right then they

6010.719 --> 6014.639
kind of they get the tendency to

6012.719 --> 6015.52
eventually kind of surrender to it and

6014.639 --> 6019.04
then perhaps

6015.52 --> 6021.6
worship it so it's not illogical

6019.04 --> 6036.159
for that to naturally unfold from a

6021.6 --> 6039.04
position of ignorance mind you

6036.159 --> 6039.679
it's not a mystery not if you presuppose

6039.04 --> 6043.199
it's all

6039.679 --> 6046.2390000000005
balls right there's no mystery

6043.199 --> 6047.04
in in your endless space of filled with

6046.239 --> 6050.799999999999
the balls

6047.04 --> 6054.239
the laird of tropes

6050.8 --> 6065.84
no more mysteries just move along

6054.239 --> 6065.839999999999
don't think about it

6079.44 --> 6093.839999999999
yeah that's correct george sanford thank

6081.44 --> 6093.839999999999
you for that input

6095.32 --> 6101.5199999999995
ultraviolet turns the energy into fit

6099.28 --> 6101.5199999999995
d

6102.4 --> 6107.839999999999
what the hell

6108.4 --> 6121.839999999999
wait who are we addressing

6210.719 --> 6215.92
globe of the heavens and all that

6212.88 --> 6218.159000000001
consequences what could be the design

6215.92 --> 6220.0
of the realm and the waters above how

6218.159 --> 6222.799999999999
could that be arranged
