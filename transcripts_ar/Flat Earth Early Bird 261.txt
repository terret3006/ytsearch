104.57 --> 111.88999999999999
super chat donation thank you so much

108.039 --> 116.56
it's a nice start yeah I started early a

111.89 --> 119.68900000000001
bit because I've been well I've been

116.56 --> 121.57900000000001
getting a little bit late every time for

119.689 --> 126.91999999999999
almost a week now so I thought I make up

121.579 --> 132.739
by starting twelve minutes early and I

126.92 --> 137.56
got some things on my chest I have by

132.739 --> 141.14000000000001
the way separately just watched a

137.56 --> 142.94
improvised hangout from Jose that

141.14 --> 144.22
happened a few hours ago that looked

142.94 --> 148.1
interesting

144.22 --> 152.269
it just seemed like face to face talk

148.1 --> 154.7
with a a girl I don't know how she'll

152.269 --> 157.07
old she was I didn't I just looked in

154.7 --> 159.92
the middle of somewhere who was a global

157.07 --> 161.39
but still conspiracy theorizing and it

159.92 --> 165.23999999999998
was a really interesting conversation

161.39 --> 168.08999999999997
reminds me a lot of how conversation

165.24 --> 175.97
feel that I have in coffee shops with

168.09 --> 178.41
people so that was kind of amusing right

175.97 --> 183.81
so yeah let's just say hello to those

178.41 --> 187.01999999999998
who are in chat already a gem cache

183.81 --> 190.38
Wizzle is that how you pronounce that

187.02 --> 193.70000000000002
cache Wizzle and of course in Jennifer

190.38 --> 196.89
Winterburn over mukou stone monkey 3d

193.7 --> 204.75
Tesla Apple good to see you guys and

196.89 --> 211.14
gals but yeah I you might have noticed I

204.75 --> 218.01
had I had some I guess temporary issues

211.14 --> 220.04999999999998
or it's it's really even frustrating or

218.01 --> 221.92999999999998
difficult to talk about because I got

220.05 --> 226.16000000000003
the feeling that I'm being

221.93 --> 231.33
psychologically assaulted by spurs chemo

226.16 --> 237.09
and well gap ballers of course but in

231.33 --> 239.22
that fashion and now ranty it's kind of

237.09 --> 241.65
being sorta doing it before and I took

239.22 --> 245.82
it as sarcasm because he does get this

241.65 --> 249.48000000000002
weird voice when he does that but it's

245.82 --> 254.54999999999998
it's disgusting I cannot accept this

249.48 --> 258.23
behavior I cannot like they they're

254.55 --> 263.58
literally trying to guess like me um

258.23 --> 266.16
that I'm being not open-minded that I

263.58 --> 269.66999999999996
just don't get it it's a total Gaslight

266.16 --> 273.51000000000005
situation and I'm I'm furious about this

269.67 --> 278.1
that they do this that that is troll

273.51 --> 282.09
level but not in chat but actually face

278.1 --> 285.08000000000004
to face having the gall to do that and I

282.09 --> 285.08
am repulsed

286.32 --> 290.73
and I'm already kind of sick of Sporus

288.57 --> 291.63
chemo in general every time doing his

290.73 --> 295.07
weirdo

291.63 --> 298.40999999999997
Brenda routine with with his concept

295.07 --> 300.57
it's gonna keep on it I don't see a lot

298.41 --> 305.07000000000005
of good coming out of it at all

300.57 --> 309.81
I think it'll get worse and this is just

305.07 --> 315.15
a terrible trend and I don't really know

309.81 --> 317.69
what to do about it if this continues on

315.15 --> 322.89
it's all gonna be so derailed

317.69 --> 326.88
it's gonna be just cut loose cut loose

322.89 --> 328.97999999999996
from logos as well it's gonna go into

326.88 --> 331.26
total solipsistic reversal where

328.98 --> 333.06
suddenly everything becomes possible and

331.26 --> 334.86
people start to believe whatever they

333.06 --> 339.24
like and it becomes totally [ __ ]

334.86 --> 341.01
delusional and people don't even listen

339.24 --> 343.26
to one another anymore because it's

341.01 --> 345.18
become so incoherent everything that's

343.26 --> 353.52
what I predict will come out of this if

345.18 --> 356.01
it's not stopped well you got a wrong

353.52 --> 359.52
tesla's Apple there's rumors I addressed

356.01 --> 363.8
it yesterday it isn't canceled if it was

359.52 --> 363.79999999999995
canceled I would have seen it

380.689 --> 391.34900000000005
Thank You Jennifer Winterburn it's the

388.71 --> 393.539
thing is when Randy and even when super

391.349 --> 397.52
schema does it it's kinda played out

393.539 --> 401.81899999999996
with like an angry sadist undertone and

397.52 --> 403.889
it's just downplayed like why are you

401.819 --> 406.8
making such a hassle of this why don't

403.889 --> 410.729
you just let us do this or why do you

406.8 --> 411.71000000000004
think because you're destabilizing the

410.729 --> 415.55
works

411.71 --> 419.00899999999996
the real digging we need to do the solid

415.55 --> 422.849
foundations for the actual figuring it

419.009 --> 425.069
out and now it's good to test some

422.849 --> 429.05
things but to then turn it into a

425.069 --> 434.999
freakin narrative that you're gonna push

429.05 --> 439.469
that's not good you know I like to test

434.999 --> 441.749
things I do it a lot and more than often

439.469 --> 444.36
it when I do something like that I

441.749 --> 449.509
quickly figure out a way to I wasn't

444.36 --> 449.509
mistaken let just move on

453.35 --> 460.85
I don't know Ragnar Stefan elderson I

459.52 --> 464.78
unsubscribe

460.85 --> 466.49
I like this was the drop there's been

464.78 --> 471.59
issues with Randi before with his

466.49 --> 473.72
attitude and the way he I think Ron T

471.59 --> 478.07
has a bit of a Savannah complex in him

473.72 --> 480.29
and that doesn't mean that he's now the

478.07 --> 482.9
ultimate shoe or blah blah blah

480.29 --> 489.95000000000005
because yeah his photography work and

482.9 --> 493.13
his overall dedication should not be

489.95 --> 495.34999999999997
downplayed I will not say that he's

493.13 --> 499.76
useless or anything but this is just

495.35 --> 503.87
wrong and I can't tolerate it like it

499.76 --> 504.83
makes me nauseated literally and he's

503.87 --> 507.47
not a baller

504.83 --> 509.06
he's an unhinged flat earther that

507.47 --> 513.9100000000001
that's basically what you could call it

509.06 --> 519.669
unhinged off the chain no more logos

513.91 --> 528.68
going into wherever getting experimental

519.669 --> 530.66
with reality that unhinged and I don't

528.68 --> 535.31
know what Randy is doing he's probably

530.66 --> 539.99
just gonna keep on entertaining ballers

535.31 --> 542.3299999999999
and he's gone Jose he's gone to do

539.99 --> 545.45
exactly what Jose does except he has a

542.33 --> 551.5400000000001
little bit more backing and that seems

545.45 --> 557.33
to be what he does and maybe maybe

551.54 --> 559.16
Randy's also just gotten bored with with

557.33 --> 561.38
the regular flatter maybe that is it

559.16 --> 566.0
maybe he is simply bored with it and he

561.38 --> 568.64
just wants to keep on exploring even

566.0 --> 571.13
though it crosses certain lines of

568.64 --> 574.1
sanity maybe that's why he's doing this

571.13 --> 576.65
because he's just chronically board with

574.1 --> 581.8100000000001
the regurgitation [ __ ] from both sides

576.65 --> 583.97
and hey I don't blame him but then let

581.81 --> 586.64
yourself literally be tempted by the

583.97 --> 589.76
spirit of Lucifer to sidestep logos

586.64 --> 591.86
that's just wrong it's wrong it's always

589.76 --> 595.1899999999999
wrong there's no good reason to do that

591.86 --> 599.57
ever unless you want to do a specific

595.19 --> 603.6800000000001
mind experiment and contain it say it

599.57 --> 607.87
just like I do when I presuppose baller

603.68 --> 611.93
universe concepts literally every time

607.87 --> 613.9590000000001
clearly mark the territory like this is

611.93 --> 617.05
not a part of reality this is a

613.959 --> 620.2689999999999
presuppositional thing I'm gonna put out

617.05 --> 624.14
that's that's okay that's not what

620.269 --> 626.3
they're doing they're literally reality

624.14 --> 629.6
itself saying no no you have we don't

626.3 --> 635.93
sense it it's not there it's this and

629.6 --> 638.8100000000001
mix it all up into this lesser form of

635.93 --> 643.39
reasoning in just a car [ __ ]

638.81 --> 643.39
construction that's not coherent

644.63 --> 647.74
[Music]

650.8 --> 658.7199999999999
right now and look sprout laugher I'm

655.97 --> 662.03
not necessarily saying that Randy is

658.72 --> 667.96
unhinged saying that he seems to be

662.03 --> 667.9599999999999
tagging along with the unhinged movement

669.46 --> 681.14
right well look sprout lover if Randy is

674.75 --> 684.89
saner Benny is then he Benny's knowingly

681.14 --> 691.43
lying either he is literally falling for

684.89 --> 695.36
it or he's lying and going along with it

691.43 --> 699.53
for his amusement or to to gather a

695.36 --> 705.07
flock that he thinks he gets and can

699.53 --> 705.0699999999999
manipulate either way it's bad news

710.12 --> 713.22
[Music]

717.72 --> 723.82
right septet

719.94 --> 726.1800000000001
yeah I would imagine rumpus is just a

723.82 --> 730.9300000000001
lot of bluster and a lot of quick talk

726.18 --> 733.66
he's perfected his trickery by doing the

730.93 --> 736.7199999999999
rapid talk that's you know it is even

733.66 --> 738.64
classified as a a technique to

736.72 --> 742.12
manipulate by being a really quick

738.64 --> 744.67
talker and being very almost talking

742.12 --> 748.12
like playing a piano like playing Mozart

744.67 --> 750.64
and he is very with his Tony does a lot

748.12 --> 754.93
of things in this very he's really like

750.64 --> 756.97
playing a a tune with his voice as he

754.93 --> 761.4699999999999
does it very quickly and that's his

756.97 --> 763.99
trick doesn't make it make more sense or

761.47 --> 766.09
something and so I can imagine that a

763.99 --> 767.86
lot of ballers find him very annoying

766.09 --> 774.85
because he doesn't listen and he's

767.86 --> 777.85
extremely arrogant at times like I for

774.85 --> 781.9300000000001
some reason he's been kind of polite to

777.85 --> 782.89
me maybe because I reciprocate I just

781.93 --> 785.8
yeah

782.89 --> 792.4499999999999
seeing him act towards others quite

785.8 --> 792.4499999999999
quite arrogantly yeah

793.37 --> 799.7
clean beat grumpus up last night on Sean

796.4 --> 803.36
jeez okay okay I haven't seen that sorry

799.7 --> 806.9300000000001
I've gone to bed last night all not even

803.36 --> 812.0
last night last evening very early 11

806.93 --> 817.9699999999999
o'clock I I needed it very very long

812.0 --> 822.83
sleep although I got up at at 5:00 and

817.97 --> 825.26
then went back to bed at 7:00 so all in

822.83 --> 828.01
all I think I slept like 10 hours and

825.26 --> 828.01
what I needed it

832.57 --> 841.0300000000001
yeah Ragnar Stefan Halverson yeah it

835.45 --> 846.22
does seem so but look it's I've even

841.03 --> 849.55
discussed this with Randy that is yes if

846.22 --> 856.27
you give a the ballers more confidence

849.55 --> 858.79
than maybe the thought is this is that

856.27 --> 863.8
flat earthers need people to keep

858.79 --> 867.13
engaging to train us like we need the

863.8 --> 870.9699999999999
sparring to be as good as we are and

867.13 --> 874.3
maybe randy in his own weird little idea

870.97 --> 877.5400000000001
is trying to help out the enemies to

874.3 --> 879.9699999999999
keep them alive so we can fight them as

877.54 --> 889.36
i don't know maybe i but it doesn't feel

879.97 --> 893.5
like that to me it feels like a savanna

889.36 --> 896.23
is thing where he's stepping into the

893.5 --> 899.91
group consensus that is now newly formed

896.23 --> 905.01
and it's like trying to be an overlord

899.91 --> 908.26
providing a platform providing all these

905.01 --> 914.95
that's what it feels like it feels not

908.26 --> 917.56
good and that's why yeah despite despite

914.95 --> 919.51
everything in the past it's just i can't

917.56 --> 923.26
i can't do this anymore

919.51 --> 925.02
with him and yes he's promoted me yes

923.26 --> 927.12
he's been very helpful and i

925.02 --> 930.43
reciprocated that as well

927.12 --> 936.22
he even financially supported me and

930.43 --> 939.2099999999999
that well I'm not gonna just say yeah

936.22 --> 939.21
whatever

939.61 --> 946.14
he can do it I can't if I could have I

943.36 --> 949.539
would have done the same thing to him

946.14 --> 949.539
[Music]

950.79 --> 957.01
but you know just because somebody gives

955.45 --> 960.3100000000001
me money doesn't mean that they got a

957.01 --> 970.959
free rein to go wherever they like in my

960.31 --> 976.9899999999999
face no no Daniel no now he's the one

970.959 --> 979.3
that pushing me away by by trying to

976.99 --> 982.37
guess like me

979.3 --> 982.37
[Music]

994.3 --> 999.67
well what happened Daniel it happened on

997.69 --> 1002.0100000000001
the debates yesterday when spur schema

999.67 --> 1004.7099999999999
was there and he's kind of done it

1002.01 --> 1009.26
before even over Skype in private

1004.71 --> 1012.72
situations and I would be basically

1009.26 --> 1017.7
pushing back at that moment but he's

1012.72 --> 1020.7900000000001
just saying that I shouldn't get upset

1017.7 --> 1024.32
and just let's for scheme out do his

1020.79 --> 1027.68
thing and just let that all roll

1024.32 --> 1030.839
literally trying to make me stand down

1027.68 --> 1036.02
like it's not a big deal but I've

1030.839 --> 1036.02
explained exactly why it is a big deal

1037.97 --> 1045.2
why I see it as a big deal why it's not

1040.95 --> 1045.2
good it's not helping us

1067.61 --> 1074.8799999999999
hmm yeah by the way I got 10 not only

1071.73 --> 1077.6100000000001
liquids today but tea Tamera coffee and

1074.88 --> 1084.0200000000002
water that's it

1077.61 --> 1084.02
I had a an early lunch now we're go

1103.35 --> 1111.2099999999998
James recently on Jose's he's actually

1107.25 --> 1120.3
pretty cool that's that was my surprise

1111.21 --> 1123.27
like he seems to have gotten a better

1120.3 --> 1125.94
grip on himself he really I've heard him

1123.27 --> 1129.54
there and it was pretty good I was

1125.94 --> 1133.1100000000001
siding with him so he's not the same

1129.54 --> 1136.37
slick James as we had to face on the

1133.11 --> 1140.49
debates but Spurs chemo does seem to be

1136.37 --> 1144.77
going in some in a similar third-party

1140.49 --> 1148.22
direction I just call it unhinging it's

1144.77 --> 1152.67
trying to be special trying to

1148.22 --> 1156.09
cornerstone some suppose it's secret new

1152.67 --> 1164.04
reality but it doesn't really make any

1156.09 --> 1165.6599999999999
sense unhinged and in a way slicked by

1164.04 --> 1169.32
the way Thank You Nathan Oakley for

1165.66 --> 1175.3200000000002
super jet donation much appreciated 199

1169.32 --> 1179.3999999999999
pounds of thanks but select James was a

1175.32 --> 1182.6699999999998
solipsist a a fundamental solipsist in

1179.4 --> 1187.44
his own way but he was not unhinged

1182.67 --> 1191.04
necessarily he had some weird weird

1187.44 --> 1192.78
stories hey but I have some weird

1191.04 --> 1195.12
stories although I tried to contact

1192.78 --> 1197.28
realize them as correctly as possible to

1195.12 --> 1200.32
make them less weird sleek change didn't

1197.28 --> 1203.3999999999999
really make that effort but

1200.32 --> 1209.01
he's basically always been a solipsist

1203.4 --> 1212.2900000000002
but directly not not trying to derail

1209.01 --> 1215.68
everyone necessarily just baby pushing

1212.29 --> 1220.6299999999999
his solipsism that's it it wasn't that

1215.68 --> 1223.3600000000001
bad but yes first chemo is not doing

1220.63 --> 1226.66
that Wow thank you again hmm

1223.36 --> 1230.1
is that another Nathan Oakley what's

1226.66 --> 1232.93
going on anyway thank you dank

1230.1 --> 1240.85
for the five dollar super chat donation

1232.93 --> 1244.68
and the other Nathan Oakley I how's that

1240.85 --> 1250.6599999999999
even possible which one is the real

1244.68 --> 1256.3
weird anyway thanks guys but Spurs chemo

1250.66 --> 1261.91
is seems to be he's not being a

1256.3 --> 1265.36
solipsist he's just basically cut a gap

1261.91 --> 1267.73
in reality by starting out saying we do

1265.36 --> 1271.4699999999998
not I do not sense this I don't know why

1267.73 --> 1274.8600000000001
people have been indoctrinated in the

1271.47 --> 1277.57
supposed sensing of pressure change and

1274.86 --> 1279.4599999999998
then even not seeing it that correctly

1277.57 --> 1283.36
just messing it up being as muddy as

1279.46 --> 1286.75
possible with this description to show

1283.36 --> 1289.03
to basically hide the fact that there is

1286.75 --> 1291.46
no strong coral that there is no strong

1289.03 --> 1295.68
structure there's nothing really

1291.46 --> 1299.53
supporting his theory Oh what the hell

1295.68 --> 1303.22
is that Yin thank you

1299.53 --> 1307.29
free-minded fe for the 500 yen super jet

1303.22 --> 1310.59
donation huh from Japan cool thanks

1307.29 --> 1310.59
that's a new

1311.999 --> 1319.869
but Spurs Kimo is not saying look I'm

1316.57 --> 1323.23
not believing anything anymore and then

1319.869 --> 1325.029
showing issues and building it logically

1323.23 --> 1331.98
step by step Wow

1325.029 --> 1335.83
what is going on okay thanks thanks

1331.98 --> 1337.749
Amanda young for the $4 super jet are

1335.83 --> 1344.98
you super Chad donating to make me stop

1337.749 --> 1351.3990000000001
talking about this subject Thanks thanks

1344.98 --> 1355.259
Nathan again this is really distracting

1351.399 --> 1355.2589999999998
though but I haven't

1363.75 --> 1372.669
talking about right if I would have been

1370.0 --> 1375.94
Spurs Kimo and not so much in a hurry

1372.669 --> 1379.15
and trying to conceptualize the whole is

1375.94 --> 1382.48
gas pressure really a thing I just look

1379.15 --> 1385.27
at it honest and well people might not

1382.48 --> 1388.419
have even noticed because I just say it

1385.27 --> 1390.6399999999999
a couple of sentences and that is it but

1388.419 --> 1393.25
I kind of did that I really did

1390.64 --> 1395.5
entertain his concept and just figured

1393.25 --> 1399.97
it out like is it is the correlate is

1395.5 --> 1404.1
that are they interchangeable but no no

1399.97 --> 1407.08
they're not one always follows the other

1404.1 --> 1409.51
they're never on equal footing the

1407.08 --> 1411.46
pressure increases then also the

1409.51 --> 1414.789
temperature starts to increase somewhat

1411.46 --> 1418.0
but never as much as the pressure and if

1414.789 --> 1420.429
the temperature increases then the

1418.0 --> 1423.309
pressure will follow but never as much

1420.429 --> 1426.669
as the temperature and that's the

1423.309 --> 1432.309
relation that will I promise you will be

1426.669 --> 1434.679
their relation every single time and so

1432.309 --> 1436.24
they are not interchangeable one follows

1434.679 --> 1440.679
the other that's simply it

1436.24 --> 1442.99
I can't simplify it anymore so it's done

1440.679 --> 1448.89
that's say that's basically yeah that's

1442.99 --> 1448.89
end of concept that's it

1450.85 --> 1457.9599999999998
and now of course knowing that as a

1455.08 --> 1461.279
concept and looking in today to

1457.96 --> 1464.679
considering pressure and temperature is

1461.279 --> 1468.639
kind of useful and that is kind of the

1464.679 --> 1469.929
thing why I really liked that part on

1468.639 --> 1473.59
the debates where I had the conversation

1469.929 --> 1476.259
with Adam ikan because we were talking

1473.59 --> 1478.4499999999998
about the issues with the pressure and

1476.259 --> 1480.909
the temperature not necessarily even the

1478.45 --> 1483.8500000000001
cost but just the issue like the balloon

1480.909 --> 1488.1390000000001
that it will rupture because of the

1483.85 --> 1494.6999999999998
conditions and how do you how do you fix

1488.139 --> 1498.37
it so it's good to think about it but to

1494.7 --> 1500.8600000000001
jump ahead to conclusions and say that

1498.37 --> 1504.25
there is no gas pressure there is only

1500.86 --> 1507.539
temperature it's nonsensical and there

1504.25 --> 1512.32
is no empirical evidence to back that up

1507.539 --> 1513.37
not even yea flash-freezing a balloon

1512.32 --> 1518.4399999999998
with air in it

1513.37 --> 1522.4189999999999
in a bunch of liquid nitrogen no by the

1518.44 --> 1522.419
way yeah Adam oh thanks again Nathan

1523.799 --> 1538.87
but Adam ikan Wow thanks man Adam ikan

1531.519 --> 1543.009
did put out a video on the early bird

1538.87 --> 1545.559
chat and he blew up a balloon outside in

1543.009 --> 1550.059
it and then put it in his freezer and

1545.559 --> 1553.36
left it for a couple of hours and when

1550.059 --> 1555.279
he came back the balloon was just as

1553.36 --> 1558.7589999999998
large it hadn't shrunk and even a little

1555.279 --> 1560.95
bit so I I was even surprised to see

1558.759 --> 1564.549
that I thought what should probably

1560.95 --> 1570.3600000000001
shrink a little bit right but no no it

1564.549 --> 1570.36
didn't so that's interesting

1570.37 --> 1576.6789999999999
also now makes me think that of course

1573.26 --> 1579.92
if you put something in the freezer then

1576.679 --> 1583.88
as it has been open the air pressure is

1579.92 --> 1587.059
kind of equalized with the rest so at

1583.88 --> 1589.8700000000001
that the balance between the balloon and

1587.059 --> 1593.1499999999999
the air surrounding it as it is being

1589.87 --> 1597.02
put into or as it is being cut off in

1593.15 --> 1601.49
the container and then everything is

1597.02 --> 1607.04
called that means that that I said is

1601.49 --> 1609.559
the the the relation between the air

1607.04 --> 1611.09
surrounding balloon and inside the

1609.559 --> 1612.53
balloon is going to be pretty consistent

1611.09 --> 1616.6999999999998
so it shouldn't

1612.53 --> 1619.8799999999999
shrink in size because the air outside

1616.7 --> 1624.89
of it is going to shrink similarly so

1619.88 --> 1627.0200000000002
the the pressure will stay equal but

1624.89 --> 1631.0300000000002
then again as soon as it should as soon

1627.02 --> 1635.57
as you would have taken it out then it

1631.03 --> 1637.04
what naturally at first maybe shrink a

1635.57 --> 1643.9399999999998
little because the temperature outside

1637.04 --> 1645.74
is more but I think would you guys agree

1643.94 --> 1647.8400000000001
I didn't

1645.74 --> 1650.03
really it will probably be barely

1647.84 --> 1653.4189999999999
noticeable because you grabbed it out

1650.03 --> 1656.36
it's the normal size and then at first

1653.419 --> 1658.7
it might expand a little and then after

1656.36 --> 1662.02
a while contract again because the

1658.7 --> 1662.02
temperatures become equal

1670.52 --> 1679.58
hmm anyway I think these kind of Oh

1676.059 --> 1681.71
experiments tests Figgy seeing what

1679.58 --> 1685.07
happens I think it is really interesting

1681.71 --> 1687.53
and again very relevant we we need to

1685.07 --> 1690.77
know about these things since we are as

1687.53 --> 1694.97
flat earther says cosmogony explorers

1690.77 --> 1697.01
realm explorers wanting to do that we

1694.97 --> 1700.28
are dealing with temperatures and

1697.01 --> 1703.25
pressure differences and balloons so we

1700.28 --> 1704.809
should know about these things and and

1703.25 --> 1712.3
check it out and test it out for

1704.809 --> 1712.3
ourselves experience it ponder upon it

1714.43 --> 1717.6090000000002
[Music]

1722.25 --> 1728.87
no notice that tapi I don't think so

1733.84 --> 1746.35
but look yeah to say things are pretty

1738.28 --> 1749.05
close to a vacuum look a vacuum I think

1746.35 --> 1754.9299999999998
there's like a half re a half pressure

1749.05 --> 1759.19
concept at it so even though the total

1754.93 --> 1765.6000000000001
sum from 1 psi goes down a very little

1759.19 --> 1773.71
amount if you decrease that 0.05 psi to

1765.6 --> 1776.9099999999999
0.02 would be radically yeah more there

1773.71 --> 1784.74
would be a lot more vacuum power so a

1776.91 --> 1784.74
perfect vacuum is not achievable anyway

1787.41 --> 1795.67
but anyway there is a way to prevent it

1792.31 --> 1798.28
be closed off balloon then as we all

1795.67 --> 1801.3400000000001
know it starts out almost like a almost

1798.28 --> 1802.93
and blown up that's how those weather

1801.34 --> 1805.4499999999998
balloons start and then as they go up

1802.93 --> 1807.3100000000002
higher they start to expand and expand

1805.45 --> 1812.5
and expand and then when they go to that

1807.31 --> 1816.7
certain moment they we've seen it happen

1812.5 --> 1818.83
so the total pressure within the in the

1816.7 --> 1821.56
balloon at the high regions become too

1818.83 --> 1823.6599999999999
much for the volume so then the

1821.56 --> 1827.62
structure is just pressured until it

1823.66 --> 1830.71
ruptures but that can be accounted for

1827.62 --> 1833.8899999999999
to prevent a rupture and make it able to

1830.71 --> 1837.69
continue on even higher using a valve a

1833.89 --> 1844.21
valve that would respond specifically to

1837.69 --> 1846.79
a certain level of pressure I think that

1844.21 --> 1849.25
would prevent the rupture and instead

1846.79 --> 1853.24
puff out a little bit of pressure to

1849.25 --> 1855.61
make it prevent exploding and then it

1853.24 --> 1858.4
could go up even higher who knows how

1855.61 --> 1863.55
high you could go maybe you could even

1858.4 --> 1863.5500000000002
bump into the dog at some point

1891.36 --> 1898.4499999999998
and I think that what would technically

1894.76 --> 1903.94
happen if you had a valve to prevent a

1898.45 --> 1910.96
balloon explosion then it would probably

1903.94 --> 1913.42
go until yeah until it has indeed found

1910.96 --> 1916.77
its equilibrium point with the total

1913.42 --> 1919.27
mass of an D helium and the balloon

1916.77 --> 1923.56
structure and added technical the

1919.27 --> 1925.84
technical things when it's found its

1923.56 --> 1928.09
equilibrium point which would eventually

1925.84 --> 1933.79
be reached at some height

1928.09 --> 1937.9499999999998
it would just hang there until gradually

1933.79 --> 1941.47
some of the gas within he's still pretty

1937.95 --> 1944.3500000000001
pressurized balloon would gradually

1941.47 --> 1948.21
start to slip out because it is so tiny

1944.35 --> 1951.4599999999998
and then eventually the bloom would

1948.21 --> 1953.2
slowly slowly go to could potentially

1951.46 --> 1957.3
take years I have no I'm just saying

1953.2 --> 1959.95
something randomly add it in my mind I

1957.3 --> 1962.4099999999999
might take years before it eventually go

1959.95 --> 1964.68
down or maybe it'll take days I don't

1962.41 --> 1964.68
know

1972.28 --> 1979.42
yeah but Dave Johnson that's why I

1974.73 --> 1982.98
suggested to put valve on there to vent

1979.42 --> 1985.8700000000001
some of that pressure so it can maintain

1982.98 --> 1988.77
structural integrity and then you don't

1985.87 --> 1988.77
have that problem anymore

1997.75 --> 2022.58
oh right hmm hello it is you know what

2019.07 --> 2022.58
you deserve it

2035.85 --> 2047.8899999999999
Wow 33 minutes and 33 seconds mark that

2044.11 --> 2050.169
time is flown I do feel a lot better now

2047.89 --> 2053.8900000000003
that I got some of this stuff off my

2050.169 --> 2056.2599999999998
chest because I don't take potential

2053.89 --> 2060.6099999999997
friendship lightly it really does weigh

2056.26 --> 2062.98
in and betrayal really does hurt or even

2060.61 --> 2065.59
if it isn't pure full betrayal even if

2062.98 --> 2068.11
it is just somebody you considered to be

2065.59 --> 2071.98
relatively close at or consider friends

2068.11 --> 2074.71
to basically fall off the path that

2071.98 --> 2084.22
hurts as well see buddy to see somebody

2074.71 --> 2090.34
slip away so I'm glad well I'm glad that

2084.22 --> 2093.1789999999996
I at least tell took a stand because in

2090.34 --> 2097.2400000000002
the past I've let Randy basically

2093.179 --> 2099.9100000000003
downplay things kind of because I

2097.24 --> 2102.97
thought like yeah he is kind of a guy

2099.91 --> 2106.5299999999997
it's a working man and yeah okay I'm not

2102.97 --> 2108.8199999999997
so I kind of took the the beta position

2106.53 --> 2112.84
but I'm not doing that anymore because

2108.82 --> 2119.82
he's showing things that I do not accept

2112.84 --> 2119.82
in an alpha so that's it done

2123.21 --> 2130.21
no no he didn't calm me down at all

2126.28 --> 2138.3100000000004
Daniel you actually accused me of not

2130.21 --> 2141.4
being open-minded okay that that's a

2138.31 --> 2144.22
real serious insult if somebody out here

2141.4 --> 2151.15
is freaking open-minded it's me I can

2144.22 --> 2152.98
conceptualize anything really well if it

2151.15 --> 2155.35
makes any damn sense and if it doesn't

2152.98 --> 2164.01
then I can conceptualize and explain

2155.35 --> 2167.11
exactly how it doesn't as I have now it

2164.01 --> 2173.6200000000003
seemed earlier I'm not mad I'm

2167.11 --> 2176.2000000000003
disappointed and I'm sickened look I'm

2173.62 --> 2177.73
not mad I'm not am I calling him names

2176.2 --> 2182.83
or anything no I'm just really

2177.73 --> 2186.4900000000002
disappointed and I worry I worry because

2182.83 --> 2190.69
I do care about what is going on in flat

2186.49 --> 2194.37
earth and I do carry or it carries

2190.69 --> 2198.88
weight with me where this is all going

2194.37 --> 2201.4
what we'll end up with at the end of the

2198.88 --> 2205.4500000000003
journey for the individuals when others

2201.4 --> 2208.9
will eventually take their place in some

2205.45 --> 2212.6499999999996
other form and I don't want it to mutate

2208.9 --> 2215.94
into something totally destructive and

2212.65 --> 2220.21
solipsistic and evil and unhinged I

2215.94 --> 2225.94
worry for the long run I worry that

2220.21 --> 2228.52
people somehow out of some weird twiki

2225.94 --> 2231.76
boredom will just start to derail

2228.52 --> 2234.16
themselves and just be

2231.76 --> 2237.0
attention-grabbing and have crazy ideas

2234.16 --> 2237.0
that make no sense

2239.84 --> 2242.98
I worry about that

2244.59 --> 2248.2490000000003
[Music]

2252.85 --> 2257.14
yes yes white bear I can conceptualize

2256.15 --> 2261.4
as fear

2257.14 --> 2263.35
indeed I can I can absolutely presuppose

2261.4 --> 2266.83
it and even know what that

2263.35 --> 2270.25
presupposition entails and where are all

2266.83 --> 2272.62
the problems so that if I would have to

2270.25 --> 2275.65
present it in acceptable way I would

2272.62 --> 2281.3399999999997
have to cover up those big problems in

2275.65 --> 2281.34
order to help the suspense of disbelief

2282.0 --> 2286.74
but I can absolutely

2293.45 --> 2301.339
right well reckon our Stefan he'll

2296.24 --> 2304.5789999999997
listen being open-minded and opinions

2301.339 --> 2310.15
that's one thing but if it's just gonna

2304.579 --> 2313.04
be obviously derailed nonsensical and

2310.15 --> 2315.2000000000003
it's gonna be repeated over and over and

2313.04 --> 2319.0099999999998
over again while at the same time people

2315.2 --> 2322.1499999999996
are being misled gas-lit and strim and

2319.01 --> 2325.3390000000004
and red herring the [ __ ] out of on a

2322.15 --> 2327.76
very hostile level compared to that of

2325.339 --> 2331.49
the psychological attacks of ballers

2327.76 --> 2340.94
then I don't think that being against

2331.49 --> 2343.7599999999998
that is a lack of open mindedness you

2340.94 --> 2345.799
know I did allow him I really killed it

2343.76 --> 2346.46
a little because I was pretty sure of

2345.799 --> 2350.45
the outcome

2346.46 --> 2352.4900000000002
I was pretty quick to arrive to the

2350.45 --> 2355.359
relation between temperature and gas

2352.49 --> 2359.1189999999997
pressure it was very quick to presented

2355.359 --> 2361.97
no response they're not listening they

2359.119 --> 2363.4700000000003
are not listening I even confronted spur

2361.97 --> 2366.5589999999997
schema with it why are you not

2363.47 --> 2369.859
responding to what I said and he just

2366.559 --> 2373.8190000000004
move on like he didn't hear it exactly

2369.859 --> 2376.089
like a baller what am I supposed to do

2373.819 --> 2381.68
am I just gonna sit there and say oh

2376.089 --> 2384.5
well okay I tried to just let him talk

2381.68 --> 2387.29
hours and hours and hours and hours like

2384.5 --> 2390.71
some Brenda and then the next day again

2387.29 --> 2393.41
and the day after again and the day

2390.71 --> 2399.79
after again and just supposed to be

2393.41 --> 2399.79
doing nothing not no no

2408.82 --> 2415.84
no I don't hate Spurs zero defects but I

2413.89 --> 2420.79
certainly do not like him I don't like

2415.84 --> 2426.82
how he does things I think he's sneaky

2420.79 --> 2431.02
and he's manipulative and he's yeah yeah

2426.82 --> 2434.46
that's it it's just how he how he act

2431.02 --> 2434.46
and how he talks

2442.31 --> 2447.56
what are you talking about look reckoner

2445.82 --> 2450.8
Stefan he'll listen when it concerns

2447.56 --> 2456.14
Nathan Oakley yeah he does it in certain

2450.8 --> 2458.84
regions and I confronted him with it but

2456.14 --> 2462.83
I'm not getting any I'm just getting

2458.84 --> 2467.8700000000003
scoffing when I pushed that and there is

2462.83 --> 2470.81
no response to it so I prefer that the

2467.87 --> 2473.93
argument simply doesn't go there because

2470.81 --> 2478.4
it just breaks open a rotten parts

2473.93 --> 2481.1
that's no use to anyone so that's why I

2478.4 --> 2485.11
try to step in before it goes there and

2481.1 --> 2485.11
get it to sensible ground

2490.43 --> 2493.8799999999997
all right Sara Deever yeah I almost

2492.799 --> 2496.49
forgot about that

2493.88 --> 2497.9900000000002
he did say that didn't he you were in it

2496.49 --> 2501.77
for the money yeah that was pretty

2497.99 --> 2505.0099999999998
freakin disgusting he's being oh hi

2501.77 --> 2507.799
horsey about like oh no I'm just doing

2505.01 --> 2511.46
this because I love he's being like a

2507.799 --> 2517.0
freakin leftist politician he acts like

2511.46 --> 2517.0
one he talks like one he thinks like one

2518.319 --> 2523.7889999999998
yeah yeah yeah thanks for reminding me

2521.539 --> 2525.8900000000003
yeah actually I do hate swear scheme I

2523.789 --> 2528.6090000000004
do think he's a pretty disgusting guy

2525.89 --> 2532.339
now that then that I'm thinking about it

2528.609 --> 2535.5789999999997
yeah see I even have the natural

2532.339 --> 2538.369
tendency to just forget about annoying

2535.579 --> 2541.69
things from people in order to get by

2538.369 --> 2541.69
and thanks for reminding me

2543.16 --> 2549.41
all right well do you have a problem

2545.72 --> 2551.75
with that zero defects or are you a

2549.41 --> 2554.6499999999996
super scheme ofan gonna troll me is that

2551.75 --> 2554.65
what you're gonna be doing

2562.36 --> 2570.6400000000003
because yeah if you mean by I can shed

2566.92 --> 2575.92
on him in the sense that he was trying

2570.64 --> 2578.89
to defend solipsism at first when he was

2575.92 --> 2583.0
trying to basically be all protective

2578.89 --> 2585.8799999999997
towards slick James because he was being

2583.0 --> 2587.35
so because he was breaking because he

2585.88 --> 2589.54
was getting unhinged and that's where

2587.35 --> 2599.5
spur schema likes to be he wants to

2589.54 --> 2605.32
unhinge things he is a left-hand path so

2599.5 --> 2607.66
yeah I I detected it and I look it

2605.32 --> 2612.04
really does come down to the path and

2607.66 --> 2615.0699999999997
the frequency and the what I feel about

2612.04 --> 2619.6
it and I stand by that I am not mistaken

2615.07 --> 2622.71
there is zero percent chance that anyone

2619.6 --> 2626.95
out there can Gaslight me about how I

2622.71 --> 2632.35
perceive the frequencies and how I back

2626.95 --> 2634.7799999999997
my arguments when I step away from a

2632.35 --> 2637.27
person when I start to say I don't want

2634.78 --> 2643.21
to associate anymore I am pretty damn

2637.27 --> 2647.14
clear about it right okay I thought so

2643.21 --> 2650.29
zero defects yes you could call Spurs a

2647.14 --> 2651.79
very good role that's kind of a

2650.29 --> 2654.31
contradiction though because trolls

2651.79 --> 2658.75
never are really good it's a negative

2654.31 --> 2661.87
quality but yeah whether you just call

2658.75 --> 2664.45
him a troll as in Oh a troll for a farm

2661.87 --> 2668.56
just doing it to amuse my ego

2664.45 --> 2672.72
anonymously or if he is literally trying

2668.56 --> 2676.24
to unhinge a movement with his hypnotist

2672.72 --> 2679.81
freakin psychology voice [ __ ] that he

2676.24 --> 2683.2299999999996
tries to pull and his nonsensical lame

2679.81 --> 2686.47
reasoning oh I don't think that's a

2683.23 --> 2690.67
troll I I see it as a hostile operation

2686.47 --> 2693.75
I don't say he's a shoe where you go no

2690.67 --> 2693.75
he might just be

2695.02 --> 2700.39
needing in need of this just demon

2698.08 --> 2703.42
coming out saying no I won I want this I

2700.39 --> 2705.85
can do this I want this because because

2703.42 --> 2708.61
I can maybe that's it I don't know what

2705.85 --> 2711.1
is but he is unhinging things he's been

2708.61 --> 2716.17
doing that since Slick took note of that

2711.1 --> 2723.8399999999997
and he is hungry for more subjects to

2716.17 --> 2725.77
unhinge and that's what he's doing and

2723.84 --> 2728.44
it worries me

2725.77 --> 2730.57
I basically stopped caring for Spurs

2728.44 --> 2732.55
Kimo himself because I think that as

2730.57 --> 2736.63
soon as you become hungry to unhinge

2732.55 --> 2737.23
things to break logos that you can't be

2736.63 --> 2739.62
safe

2737.23 --> 2742.54
it's like committing slow suicide

2739.62 --> 2744.91
effectively there's nothing to save

2742.54 --> 2746.41
about it unless you completely stop it

2744.91 --> 2747.85
but then you have to really address the

2746.41 --> 2748.95
problem that's causing it in the first

2747.85 --> 2751.63
place

2748.95 --> 2756.5699999999997
you wouldn't have built all those nasty

2751.63 --> 2756.57
behaviors if you could just do that

2765.15 --> 2771.449
and I lost track of what I was saying

2767.86 --> 2771.449
[Music]

2775.95 --> 2782.95
yeah you know what it's funny you say

2780.13 --> 2787.7200000000003
that Iraq nurse Stefan Henderson says

2782.95 --> 2789.52
Spurs did what he wanted to do he United

2787.72 --> 2792.7799999999997
global and flat earthers everything

2789.52 --> 2796.9
everyone thinks he is an idiot now yeah

2792.78 --> 2799.75
yeah agree to that the funny thing was

2796.9 --> 2806.01
is that I kind of tried to do the same

2799.75 --> 2809.619
thing in my own way except consider it

2806.01 --> 2814.9300000000003
the remember I even have a flat earth

2809.619 --> 2817.57
talks hangout episode named it the dual

2814.93 --> 2820.99
cosmic honor the dual cosmogonic all

2817.57 --> 2825.09
society a society where the globe and

2820.99 --> 2828.3689999999997
Flat Earth can both coexist without

2825.09 --> 2832.36
getting obsessed in wanting to literally

2828.369 --> 2834.9700000000003
destroy and erase the others that was my

2832.36 --> 2836.77
focus I don't know what's worse has been

2834.97 --> 2838.99
doing but it seems more like he's been

2836.77 --> 2841.42
trying to completely swipe the both

2838.99 --> 2846.66
everything else aside and just go and

2841.42 --> 2850.4500000000003
hinge and look at this new science II

2846.66 --> 2852.93
new way to approach reality that's what

2850.45 --> 2852.93
he's been doing

2866.18 --> 2871.549
Wow I didn't know that Jude I haven't

2869.39 --> 2873.14
seen him I don't know how he looks but I

2871.549 --> 2875.529
wouldn't be surprised if he has been on

2873.14 --> 2875.529
camera

2880.16 --> 2887.72
right I agree set that be indeed and

2883.75 --> 2890.29
that's I'm kind of glad that I've built

2887.72 --> 2893.18
an audience that does also include

2890.29 --> 2894.44
Global's like for example Daniel of

2893.18 --> 2897.02
course there's always going to be

2894.44 --> 2900.38
personal issues between me and some

2897.02 --> 2903.05
people and moods and everything but at

2900.38 --> 2904.73
least despite all those things we have

2903.05 --> 2907.2200000000003
kind of an understanding and that's how

2904.73 --> 2911.42
I want it because I do want Globus to

2907.22 --> 2915.62
also respond and think with me and scoop

2911.42 --> 2920.21
and C to help the development because

2915.62 --> 2923.24
I'm yeah that's part of the concept of

2920.21 --> 2928.07
the duo cosmogony society Ducasse

2923.24 --> 2936.4399999999996
mechanical society together despite our

2928.07 --> 2939.52
beliefs keep on figuring things out can

2936.44 --> 2943.85
the convention be only about facts

2939.52 --> 2947.78
Ragnar Stefan Alison I don't know I it's

2943.85 --> 2950.39
probably mostly gonna be merchandising

2947.78 --> 2951.71
oriented which is what most of the

2950.39 --> 2954.62
conventions seem to be just

2951.71 --> 2959.3
merchandising and lectures from certain

2954.62 --> 2962.0899999999997
individuals and with yeah that's what

2959.3 --> 2963.86
I've seen so far from from conventions

2962.09 --> 2967.31
so there is probably gonna be the guy

2963.86 --> 2969.77
with the flat earth disc model the mug

2967.31 --> 2971.93
that the flat earth disc model model

2969.77 --> 2974.72
maker guy is probably gonna be there as

2971.93 --> 2976.43
well and books and all kinds of things

2974.72 --> 2979.66
and yeah that's that's typically what

2976.43 --> 2979.66
those conventions are like

2994.889 --> 2997.889
hmm

3003.23 --> 3013.0190000000002
the truth will defend itself hmm not

3009.089 --> 3015.48
always but the truth usually only

3013.019 --> 3025.319
defends itself if it even if it

3015.48 --> 3027.21
recognizes itself as the truth sometimes

3025.319 --> 3029.279
you don't even see the truth of

3027.21 --> 3032.869
something and then you just let let it

3029.279 --> 3036.239
slip let it go because you didn't see it

3032.869 --> 3039.109
nah sorry I'm just being overly

3036.239 --> 3039.109
philosophical err

3039.55 --> 3042.6090000000004
[Music]

3054.77 --> 3063.97
all right hmm well that this is a good

3061.19 --> 3066.89
point Dave Johnson Dave Johnson says

3063.97 --> 3069.08
have to admit though that a lot of flat

3066.89 --> 3071.8689999999997
earth believers have their own

3069.08 --> 3073.88
individual view of how Flat Earth works

3071.869 --> 3079.2200000000003
and can't come together to fight glowers

3073.88 --> 3081.5
effectively that's true but I can say

3079.22 --> 3083.6299999999997
the same thing for the globus because

3081.5 --> 3085.52
I've seen them among them among one

3083.63 --> 3089.4500000000003
another and they get into fights over

3085.52 --> 3091.79
[ __ ] a lot as well so it's a mutual

3089.45 --> 3097.1299999999997
problem and that is just that people

3091.79 --> 3099.56
that like to build on these things on

3097.13 --> 3102.53
these ideas these views these models the

3099.56 --> 3105.38
calculations they have their own ego and

3102.53 --> 3109.6400000000003
they will always be like new it's

3105.38 --> 3112.46
slightly different because that's what

3109.64 --> 3113.99
those people that deal with this kind of

3112.46 --> 3116.7200000000003
thing that like dealing with this kind

3113.99 --> 3120.58
of thing are just typically like so that

3116.72 --> 3120.58
will always happen on every side oh

3127.57 --> 3140.5
thanks all right okay conversation can

3136.46 --> 3140.5
the conversation be only about facts

3141.28 --> 3148.699
well yeah

3143.599 --> 3152.3590000000004
Oh me about facts blood no probably not

3148.699 --> 3154.9300000000003
although look if you're just saying it

3152.359 --> 3157.069
correctly if you just say okay

3154.93 --> 3159.3489999999997
presupposing this and this and that and

3157.069 --> 3166.069
then conceptualize from that point on

3159.349 --> 3168.1090000000004
then it is kind of factual cause you're

3166.069 --> 3169.91
building on a structure based on an

3168.109 --> 3172.0989999999997
almost Foundation which is factual

3169.91 --> 3174.8799999999997
namely that it you are engaging in a

3172.099 --> 3174.88
free supposition

3183.67 --> 3193.9300000000003
nice a McKenzie globe earth is lollipops

3189.71 --> 3193.93
and fancy fats indeed

3200.89 --> 3207.9
no Jason chromic it's not pronounced our

3204.4 --> 3207.9
vain thank you

3213.52 --> 3219.49
you don't you don't have you can't

3216.13 --> 3225.57
pronounce it Dutch it's rare for people

3219.49 --> 3228.4599999999996
to be able to do that because it's its

3225.57 --> 3230.8
vowel rotation we have our own vowels

3228.46 --> 3232.41
you don't know him it's not in the

3230.8 --> 3235.53
English language

3232.41 --> 3235.5299999999997
[Music]

3243.43 --> 3250.02
AES and my house key good morning

3293.18 --> 3299.5389999999998
well Zep tepi I'm pretty sure that the

3296.27 --> 3308.39
English can pronounce it either because

3299.539 --> 3311.349
I a iia is just not that's the rest like

3308.39 --> 3315.14
some countries of Europe can do that but

3311.349 --> 3316.7000000000003
not England so it's not just the

3315.14 --> 3321.46
Americans they might have even more

3316.7 --> 3325.16
trouble with it than other types but

3321.46 --> 3334.46
there's just no a in the English

3325.16 --> 3340.0099999999998
language I'd I wouldn't even know how to

3334.46 --> 3343.789
describe it using phonetics with like

3340.01 --> 3347.4500000000003
yeah to emphasize how I don't even know

3343.789 --> 3350.38
how to do that how to describe how the

3347.45 --> 3350.3799999999997
sound works

3373.48 --> 3385.63
yeah Ragnar Stefan Alderson D the the

3382.54 --> 3387.46
acceleration rate like well yeah you

3385.63 --> 3389.56
could call that over it's the gravity

3387.46 --> 3394.589
constant or you could say oh wait that

3389.56 --> 3400.9
is the relative density disequilibrium

3394.589 --> 3401.5299999999997
force that is what that is you could say

3400.9 --> 3408.81
it like that

3401.53 --> 3408.8100000000004
I don't attribute that to gravity but

3409.41 --> 3416.41
that seems to be the case it does seems

3414.19 --> 3419.98
to be factual maybe there are slight

3416.41 --> 3425.68
exceptions but it is widely presented as

3419.98 --> 3427.9900000000002
being factual and it should be probably

3425.68 --> 3430.589
although maybe there are exceptions in

3427.99 --> 3433.24
some way that we don't foresee yet I

3430.589 --> 3436.66
just know that they're trying to use it

3433.24 --> 3439.2099999999996
as a one of the foundations to solidify

3436.66 --> 3444.1299999999997
the gravity aberration concepts and

3439.21 --> 3445.7200000000003
everything that's resting on that that's

3444.13 --> 3449.01
what they're using it for that doesn't

3445.72 --> 3453.43
necessarily mean that the origin of that

3449.01 --> 3457.349
measurement is false it's just the

3453.43 --> 3457.3489999999997
conclusions that are drawn from it

3465.68 --> 3471.529
it doesn't know the acceleration rate is

3469.13 --> 3474.7400000000002
the acceleration rate it matters what it

3471.529 --> 3477.98
is called in order to be specific about

3474.74 --> 3482.0
what it is you're describing so it does

3477.98 --> 3484.39
matter some but it is if you're gonna

3482.0 --> 3488.27
draw in some kind of causal relation

3484.39 --> 3490.73
like say oh but it is caused by gravity

3488.27 --> 3492.859
the apparent force this equilibrium

3490.73 --> 3495.52
constant pushing everything down or

3492.859 --> 3499.279
pulling it or whatever displacing it

3495.52 --> 3503.96
then there's a causal relation suggested

3499.279 --> 3505.94
without any actual empirical proof and

3503.96 --> 3510.44
he yeah

3505.94 --> 3513.23
scientific proof I mean but I can then

3510.44 --> 3517.839
replace that structure with the relative

3513.23 --> 3520.069
density theory which does have

3517.839 --> 3522.88
foundations in scientific proof that's

3520.069 --> 3522.88
just the difference

3526.99 --> 3540.5499999999997
I used Dell to practice my Scottish

3529.99 --> 3542.41
accent yeah the well real Scottish is is

3540.55 --> 3544.92
more than just an accent though it's not

3542.41 --> 3549.069
even the accent it's just the flow of

3544.92 --> 3552.329
the way of trying to form sentences and

3549.069 --> 3552.329
I can do it properly

3552.359 --> 3560.0099999999998
that's about the flu how he approached

3555.22 --> 3560.0099999999998
the words and you tie sentences together

3560.91 --> 3564.1299999999997
not really

3562.3 --> 3567.19
yeah I'm not I'm not - I need a lot more

3564.13 --> 3569.8900000000003
practice before I could do that but I do

3567.19 --> 3573.369
admit that listening to Scottish does

3569.89 --> 3573.97
help you get into the flow it's like a

3573.369 --> 3577.2400000000002
dance

3573.97 --> 3579.5499999999997
the words are like a dance with real old

3577.24 --> 3581.8289999999997
Scottish it's also one of the things

3579.55 --> 3590.349
that I really appreciate it from about

3581.829 --> 3593.23
the Outlander series and yeah it's also

3590.349 --> 3596.339
yeah it's an amusement factor for me

3593.23 --> 3596.339
concerning Dale as well

3602.84 --> 3608.94
huh Ragnar Stefan Alison yeah lovely

3606.3 --> 3611.07
trick question well yeah we agreed to

3608.94 --> 3615.18
that but there was some issues because

3611.07 --> 3617.61
of the automated assumption that that

3615.18 --> 3620.79
force would be gravity is why it was

3617.61 --> 3624.03
being denied at first and till I

3620.79 --> 3625.86
basically said look they're still force

3624.03 --> 3627.7200000000003
it's just caused by relative density

3625.86 --> 3631.04
disequilibrium and then proceeded to

3627.72 --> 3634.7099999999996
explain exactly how that works in detail

3631.04 --> 3636.5099999999998
so there is definitely a force but it

3634.71 --> 3639.9
manifests as soon as something comes out

3636.51 --> 3641.6600000000003
of equilibrium then it manifests the

3639.9 --> 3644.04
force because of this equilibrium

3641.66 --> 3645.06
manifests things start accelerating as

3644.04 --> 3646.77
soon as they can

3645.06 --> 3650.4
as soon as they can maneuver within the

3646.77 --> 3652.2599999999998
medium accelerate until the maximum

3650.4 --> 3655.2000000000003
velocity is reached within the medium

3652.26 --> 3659.34
and then when it finds its equilibrium

3655.2 --> 3661.62
point if ever if not blocked because it

3659.34 --> 3663.3900000000003
would require the entire medium to at

3661.62 --> 3664.83
some point basically change in order to

3663.39 --> 3667.44
do that otherwise it's just going to be

3664.83 --> 3669.7799999999997
resting on something else and then that

3667.44 --> 3674.46
force will be translated into pressure

3669.78 --> 3676.3500000000004
locally so there is a force if there is

3674.46 --> 3680.34
a lack of maneuverability for an object

3676.35 --> 3685.3399999999997
within its medium when it is in this

3680.34 --> 3685.34
equilibrium then it that force will
