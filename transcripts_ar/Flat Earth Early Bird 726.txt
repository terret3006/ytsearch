[Music]

77.84 --> 82.96000000000001
sort of like yesterday it hasn't really

81.28 --> 86.08
rained

82.96 --> 89.36
at all so far

86.08 --> 92.88
this weird thin

89.36 --> 94.64
grayish cloud bank but there's still

92.88 --> 96.72
some pieces of blue in between there

94.64 --> 99.759
although it's overall very hazy

96.72 --> 103.2
so it's not really that blue

99.759 --> 106.32
maybe up there a little all right

103.2 --> 106.96000000000001
and it's cold it's freaking cold i'm

106.32 --> 109.67999999999999
literally

106.96 --> 110.079
freezing right here it's that i don't

109.68 --> 112.56
want to

110.079 --> 114.24
completely close my door or i'll be cut

112.56 --> 118.479
off from

114.24 --> 119.83999999999999
fresh air i think

118.479 --> 123.28
because the cold the air is just a

119.84 --> 123.28
little thinner or something

123.92 --> 128.0
that's freezing or well it's not

126.64 --> 133.039
freezing it's water cold

128.0 --> 133.039
and that's just really cold so yeah

134.64 --> 139.27999999999997
i've still got my heat lamp

137.41 --> 143.12
[Music]

good to see you all so far sorry i'm a

166.72 --> 171.76
little late again it's just

168.56 --> 176.64000000000001
i i don't know

171.76 --> 176.64
timing just keeps happening

177.28 --> 180.56
anyway it's friday

182.84 --> 189.519
and i caught a little of iron

187.12 --> 189.519
works

190.64 --> 195.04
this morning hey brandon

195.12 --> 202.8
yesterday was a busy day

198.56 --> 205.04
very busy day in video land there was so

202.8 --> 205.04000000000002
much

206.159 --> 209.76
of course started out with the rage wind

208.319 --> 211.44
episode

209.76 --> 213.04
i decided not to give it a name because

211.44 --> 214.0
i don't want to highlight it too much

213.04 --> 218.56
but yesterday

214.0 --> 221.76
my god i was so pissed off

218.56 --> 224.959
i saw part of it back and it like almost

221.76 --> 224.959
was a little too much

225.36 --> 230.56
i was just really pissed off like that

227.68 --> 233.59900000000002
level is almost the same level as i get

230.56 --> 237.519
pissed off just towards

233.599 --> 240.64
everything on my own

237.519 --> 241.59900000000002
and it's yeah even though i guess it was

240.64 --> 244.39999999999998
honest

241.599 --> 244.39999999999998
was direct

245.12 --> 250.239
gave me a bitter bitter taste afterward

251.2 --> 255.83999999999997
i don't know what you guys think about

253.76 --> 255.84
it

264.16 --> 269.84000000000003
he's seeking star wars by the way

271.759 --> 276.32
right so yeah today i am in a sort of

275.12 --> 279.68
similar mood but

276.32 --> 283.759
not that not that

279.68 --> 286.32
seething but i'm still a little

283.759 --> 286.32
rowdy

287.36 --> 292.96000000000004
yeah nothing wrong with passion on the

289.04 --> 292.96000000000004
topic i know it's just still that

293.12 --> 300.88
bringing out this imagery even carefully

297.52 --> 303.919
of of all that darkness and vengeance

300.88 --> 304.71999999999997
which is really what is like sitting in

303.919 --> 308.32
there

304.72 --> 310.40000000000003
is not good it's just not good it

308.32 --> 312.479
like i don't feel it's is this

310.4 --> 313.67999999999995
productive is this actually achieving

312.479 --> 316.56
something i know it

313.68 --> 318.32
relays a feeling that a lot of people

316.56 --> 320.56
probably are sharing but i wonder

318.32 --> 320.56
just

321.36 --> 324.8
what is the effect of this is this

324.24 --> 329.039
really

324.8 --> 331.68
doing what i want it to i don't know

329.039 --> 333.199
and then interestingly enough yeah the

331.68 --> 336.639
flat earth debates was pretty good

333.199 --> 338.08000000000004
by the way but after that yeah owen

336.639 --> 341.28000000000003
benjamin went live and he

338.08 --> 343.44
really got into alchemy

341.28 --> 344.63899999999995
what that really is the spirit alchemy

343.44 --> 348.08
and and yeah

344.639 --> 348.08
gave a couple of examples

349.84 --> 358.08
like he showed this incredible clip

354.0 --> 361.28
somebody made it's like an sjw

358.08 --> 364.24
rant some person some

361.28 --> 365.35999999999996
woman in the united states and girl and

364.24 --> 367.6
this guy made this

365.36 --> 370.24
awesome metal clip with it and

367.6 --> 370.56
effectively transmutated the entire

370.24 --> 374.319
thing

370.56 --> 376.8
into yeah into something that is super

374.319 --> 378.56
awesome and exhilarating like really

376.8 --> 382.08
made something awesome with it

378.56 --> 386.4
and that's transmutation and it just

382.08 --> 387.039
it was kind of an educational slap to my

386.4 --> 390.31899999999996
face

387.039 --> 390.31899999999996
in a way because yeah

390.479 --> 395.039
i wish i would do something more than

392.4 --> 398.96
like that

395.039 --> 401.199
but it seems like i don't know i'm just

398.96 --> 401.19899999999996
like

405.12 --> 410.479
i need to find a way through this and i

407.6 --> 410.47900000000004
don't know how

412.72 --> 416.88000000000005
direct and emotional speech is hard to

414.479 --> 419.199
control but real yes i know and i do it

416.88 --> 419.199
right

420.84 --> 423.84
but

428.56 --> 432.72
am i achieving what i'm trying to

430.24 --> 432.72
achieve

434.4 --> 437.84
that's what i'm worried about

438.56 --> 445.44
right anyway

442.72 --> 446.24
yeah the owen benjamin had two streams

445.44 --> 448.88
two

446.24 --> 450.319
is pretty quickly after one other was

448.88 --> 452.56
pretty incredible

450.319 --> 454.319
so yeah it was owen benjamin day

452.56 --> 455.919
yesterday had two great streams the

454.319 --> 458.16
first one was

455.919 --> 459.84
pretty awesome with that metal clip and

458.16 --> 462.47900000000004
he made more jokes about

459.84 --> 465.75899999999996
donald trump as well and now it's come

462.479 --> 468.08
out that a new name might be donald's

465.759 --> 469.84000000000003
pump

468.08 --> 471.44
and then people yeah i went on with that

469.84 --> 474.31899999999996
with others in chat and it's like

471.44 --> 477.039
the golden pump the golden pump just

474.319 --> 481.03900000000004
wants to keep the stream going

477.039 --> 483.599
is not but it's not going to change the

481.039 --> 486.56
system it just wants to keep pumping

483.599 --> 487.68
it's yeah i love that [ __ ] that was

486.56 --> 490.56
awesome

487.68 --> 490.56
the golden pump

491.12 --> 495.44
because it's like a joke but it's also

493.36 --> 498.56
true at the same time that

495.44 --> 498.56
now that's beauty

504.96 --> 509.19899999999996
bernadette morris good to see you and

507.28 --> 512.88
earth passenger

509.199 --> 513.36
what are my ultimate goals my ultimate

512.88 --> 516.64
goals

513.36 --> 520.399
is to survive

516.64 --> 521.12
through this [ __ ] without breaking

520.399 --> 523.76
myself

521.12 --> 523.76
in anger

527.76 --> 537.6
but still maintain true you know

534.72 --> 539.6800000000001
and that's very difficult when it starts

537.6 --> 540.399
to well up to that level where you

539.68 --> 543.1999999999999
literally

540.399 --> 544.24
feel like you're losing grip on what

543.2 --> 549.839
you're doing

544.24 --> 549.839
because you're so pissed off

552.24 --> 558.08
my emotions are the fuel of of radical

555.68 --> 561.1999999999999
change

558.08 --> 563.839
of switching or like dropping off the

561.2 --> 563.839
railroads

563.92 --> 569.4399999999999
that can lead to all sorts of things it

566.08 --> 572.32
can lead to a crash it can lead to

569.44 --> 572.32
another path

574.48 --> 581.04
it's up to the individual and if they

577.92 --> 581.04
see this other path

582.16 --> 585.12
otherwise if they're going to do that

583.76 --> 585.68
it's just going to crash and what are

585.12 --> 588.9590000000001
you going to do

585.68 --> 592.0
after that mutter

588.959 --> 594.2399999999999
lose sensibility and then usually

592.0 --> 595.839
go back on the same railroad tracks

594.24 --> 598.0
that's what happens normally

595.839 --> 605.839
when you don't see an alternative track

598.0 --> 605.839
to go on to instead

607.2 --> 614.24
now i guess i'm forwarding

611.12 --> 617.2
an idea and a way of doing things

614.24 --> 618.32
that is very much in another direction

617.2 --> 620.8000000000001
of the general

618.32 --> 622.72
railroad tracks that people are on to

620.8 --> 625.76
it's a pretty radical

622.72 --> 628.72
alteration i trust it i

625.76 --> 629.8389999999999
really trust what i'm doing the method

628.72 --> 632.48
of it

629.839 --> 632.8800000000001
except for the throwing the rage out

632.48 --> 634.72
that

632.88 --> 636.0
that is really the only thing that where

634.72 --> 639.76
i have doubts

636.0 --> 639.76
because it does not really match

640.16 --> 645.92
the christian way you see

643.44 --> 646.8000000000001
it does not really like it it's normal

645.92 --> 649.76
it's

646.8 --> 650.7199999999999
human right can't blame somebody for

649.76 --> 654.0
being human but

650.72 --> 654.9590000000001
it's not really resonating i can't match

654.0 --> 657.76
it

654.959 --> 659.04
it's difficult i have it i can't really

657.76 --> 662.16
get rid of it

659.04 --> 664.079
without breaking the the truth for

662.16 --> 668.24
myself

664.079 --> 670.959
but doing it also

668.24 --> 673.04
pushes me off the path it's a it's a

670.959 --> 674.0
very difficult dilemma for me that i'm

673.04 --> 676.079
dealing with and i

674.0 --> 677.279
have been dealing with that for a longer

676.079 --> 679.4399999999999
time

677.279 --> 681.12
and now it seems to be coming like to a

679.44 --> 683.44
boiling point

681.12 --> 686.8
somehow it because it has become

683.44 --> 686.8000000000001
stronger over the last

686.839 --> 693.2
year

689.279 --> 693.2
tight rope i call it right

693.6 --> 696.88
get in nature breathe drink clean water

695.519 --> 700.0
mostly trust

696.88 --> 703.6
faith in yourself yeah

700.0 --> 707.68
i do all of that

703.6 --> 711.12
like every time i go out for groceries

707.68 --> 714.3199999999999
i make sure that i put in effort

711.12 --> 719.36
and i breathe in a lot the air

714.32 --> 719.36
and pay attention i'm just very active

720.32 --> 724.399
and there's still plenty of nature

722.0 --> 725.12
around here so the atmosphere is not

724.399 --> 728.16
that bad

725.12 --> 731.36
you know it's not like thick stinky

728.16 --> 731.76
city smell or something it's pretty

731.36 --> 734.399
green

731.76 --> 735.519
overall so going out is always going to

734.399 --> 738.55
be

735.519 --> 740.32
good over here

738.55 --> 745.519
[Music]

740.32 --> 748.88
have i studied etymology yeah sort of

745.519 --> 751.279
my my parents basically

748.88 --> 752.24
pushed that on me i'm very happy about

751.279 --> 755.68
that

752.24 --> 759.2
we were always talking about etymology

755.68 --> 761.68
when i was a kid and i

759.2 --> 762.639
yeah that's really what also drove my

761.68 --> 766.079
passion for

762.639 --> 769.2
words because every time you know

766.079 --> 771.1999999999999
if you don't get when you

769.2 --> 773.6800000000001
question words and you don't really get

771.2 --> 775.6
the answer then the curiosity dies and

773.68 --> 776.2399999999999
then also with that kind of the grip and

775.6 --> 780.0
the power

776.24 --> 783.6
the true power of words also fade

780.0 --> 787.44
and my parents really basically fed

783.6 --> 789.9200000000001
me with my curiosity and

787.44 --> 792.639
with that and that's why it really

789.92 --> 794.959
became my thing

792.639 --> 796.16
even though i really don't like looking

794.959 --> 798.2399999999999
up things or i

796.16 --> 800.24
used to not like it nowadays a little

798.24 --> 801.76
easier with google and all that although

800.24 --> 805.44
it's

801.76 --> 805.4399999999999
yeah it's also a little

807.04 --> 815.8389999999999
a little less reliable

810.48 --> 815.839
in ways

816.639 --> 820.72
but most of it i got through other

818.32 --> 820.72
people

820.8 --> 825.5999999999999
through my parents my brother

826.839 --> 829.839
anyway

835.04 --> 838.48
right own benjamin went live the second

837.199 --> 841.5999999999999
time

838.48 --> 842.0790000000001
and he got this kevin dude on like this

841.6 --> 845.9200000000001
viking

842.079 --> 848.959
looking guy again pretty awesome

845.92 --> 850.24
and yeah about health and oh yeah by the

848.959 --> 851.3599999999999
way also

850.24 --> 853.92
big bear in the first room he

851.36 --> 857.36
demonstrated that he had a new cow

853.92 --> 857.76
dandy the cow really really cute looking

857.36 --> 859.839
and

857.76 --> 861.12
explain some things about milk and all

859.839 --> 864.48
that and

861.12 --> 866.24
like old pagan knowledge and what that

864.48 --> 869.12
really is and

866.24 --> 869.12
i just love

869.44 --> 873.7600000000001
what he's doing right now because that

871.44 --> 877.1990000000001
is exactly what i try to do

873.76 --> 879.8389999999999
that is exactly exactly the level

877.199 --> 881.04
that i am trying to wield i have been

879.839 --> 884.1600000000001
for a long time

881.04 --> 887.519
except i do it in a little slower and i

884.16 --> 890.88
guess more cryptic or more

887.519 --> 894.9590000000001
fascination based way and he's

890.88 --> 899.6
he's just a bard so he's just

894.959 --> 903.04
putting down really smart ways

899.6 --> 906.24
to do it and it's his style

903.04 --> 908.399
you know i i in ways i can't really do

906.24 --> 909.199
it like he does because then i would

908.399 --> 912.959
literally

909.199 --> 916.4799999999999
be copying him that's wrong

912.959 --> 917.5999999999999
should i have to be me but it is

916.48 --> 920.88
something that i

917.6 --> 922.24
basically am like damn that's really

920.88 --> 926.0
good

922.24 --> 929.759
i wish i could grow in my own

926.0 --> 934.079
way to that level

929.759 --> 936.0790000000001
more and that's probably what he intends

934.079 --> 941.8389999999999
with it because he does want people to

936.079 --> 941.8389999999999
grow just like i do

943.04 --> 948.0
uh yeah yeah and he told about crow

944.959 --> 951.3599999999999
triple seven having his dream about it

948.0 --> 954.56
i don't really follow crow that much

951.36 --> 958.5600000000001
you know i've seen i've i'm

954.56 --> 962.16
a member of his d live stream

958.56 --> 965.68
and he does a lot of replays on there

962.16 --> 967.8389999999999
but to be honest i really don't

965.68 --> 969.199
understand what big bear likes so much

967.839 --> 972.32
about it i

969.199 --> 975.5999999999999
i don't like it

972.32 --> 977.759
i or maybe it's just

975.6 --> 979.279
that he has his really good moments and

977.759 --> 982.48
i miss out on them because

979.279 --> 986.079
a lot of what he just does is just

982.48 --> 986.0790000000001
like is that it

986.48 --> 991.04
is that so special i don't know man

991.36 --> 996.8000000000001
i i hope people don't interpret that as

994.24 --> 999.44
me being envious or it just don't get it

996.8 --> 1001.4399999999999
sometimes with him you know

999.44 --> 1003.9200000000001
i just don't get it what's so

1001.44 --> 1003.9200000000001
interesting

1006.16 --> 1010.48
and other times i've heard him that he

1008.0 --> 1012.24
was pretty on a roll and he does at

1010.48 --> 1015.1990000000001
times really have this

1012.24 --> 1016.88
phenomenal way of explaining things the

1015.199 --> 1019.279
tone of his voice

1016.88 --> 1020.079
all that and he's good at that give

1019.279 --> 1024.88
recognition

1020.079 --> 1027.6789999999999
or recognition is due but

1024.88 --> 1027.679
i don't know man

1033.439 --> 1037.28
okay here we go again well look i

1035.919 --> 1040.3190000000002
respect if you if

1037.28 --> 1041.28
some of you or all of you like it i

1040.319 --> 1052.0
don't

1041.28 --> 1055.039
i don't know why i just i don't get it

1052.0 --> 1059.59
maybe it's too off

1055.039 --> 1062.9
for me i i can't explain it

1059.59 --> 1062.8999999999999
[Music]

1064.96 --> 1069.1200000000001
although in general i have this problem

1067.36 --> 1071.6789999999999
more and more by the way

1069.12 --> 1073.12
with with many people on the flat earth

1071.679 --> 1076.4
scene

1073.12 --> 1077.84
is that i feel like they're they're

1076.4 --> 1081.3600000000001
slacking

1077.84 --> 1083.84
in their frequency in ways sometimes

1081.36 --> 1085.28
and then again look at me look at me

1083.84 --> 1088.48
with my rage win

1085.28 --> 1088.48
is that slacking too

1088.799 --> 1092.559
you know in retrospect comparing it to

1092.16 --> 1096.72
others

1092.559 --> 1096.72
it kind of is so

1096.88 --> 1100.5590000000002
and i wonder then like what you say good

1099.039 --> 1103.84
servant you tune out

1100.559 --> 1104.72
do people tune out with me when i kind

1103.84 --> 1109.4399999999998
of overstep

1104.72 --> 1112.4
that boundary

1109.44 --> 1112.4
maybe they should

1113.039 --> 1119.28
or maybe they could help me point

1116.16 --> 1121.6000000000001
out how i can fix this and trust me

1119.28 --> 1123.039
saying just pray to jesus and good

1121.6 --> 1124.799
servant you've said that many times it

1123.039 --> 1128.559
doesn't work

1124.799 --> 1133.12
really does not and jesus still helps me

1128.559 --> 1133.6
you know as i said last time when i had

1133.12 --> 1137.1999999999998
this

1133.6 --> 1140.1599999999999
this panic moment i call upon him

1137.2 --> 1141.52
it's there i know it's there it it it

1140.16 --> 1144.72
doesn't have

1141.52 --> 1144.72
a connection with this

1145.76 --> 1154.559
so i don't know

1151.2 --> 1156.96
in ways maybe it's just also frustration

1154.559 --> 1157.9189999999999
because i feel like i'm ready to get out

1156.96 --> 1159.919
in the world

1157.919 --> 1162.72
because i feel like i finally after

1159.919 --> 1164.5590000000002
roughly 20 years have managed to fix all

1162.72 --> 1168.48
the problems

1164.559 --> 1171.6
my inner turmoil and my self-confidence

1168.48 --> 1173.919
and i'm like ready to get out there now

1171.6 --> 1174.8799999999999
and maybe that is what fuels the

1173.919 --> 1178.3200000000002
frustration

1174.88 --> 1178.7990000000002
is that basically i want to get out

1178.32 --> 1181.9189999999999
there i have

1178.799 --> 1184.16
this energy but i not really ready yet

1181.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
for it mentally

1184.16 --> 1193.8400000000001
get it

1203.679 --> 1208.0
right barry daves well look that's up to

1205.44 --> 1209.2
everyone if you want to troll ballers or

1208.0 --> 1211.12
not

1209.2 --> 1213.76
i used to do that a little myself i

1211.12 --> 1217.12
don't do that anymore i just completely

1213.76 --> 1220.8799999999999
dropped that because it's

1217.12 --> 1225.12
kind of cheap and it's not fulfilling

1220.88 --> 1225.1200000000001
it it doesn't even properly

1225.28 --> 1230.24
channel the the real rage and stuff that

1229.36 --> 1232.799
i have inside

1230.24 --> 1234.48
they they don't get it out me anymore

1232.799 --> 1235.679
i'm not even that pissed off with

1234.48 --> 1238.559
baldur's they're just

1235.679 --> 1239.039
a bunch bunch of mental patients that's

1238.559 --> 1241.76
really

1239.039 --> 1243.039
what they are to me like it when they go

1241.76 --> 1245.84
all trolling

1243.039 --> 1247.919
yeah it's disruptive but i'm not even

1245.84 --> 1248.72
pissed off anymore at this moment it's

1247.919 --> 1251.1200000000001
they're just

1248.72 --> 1251.1200000000001
sad

1252.08 --> 1257.1999999999998
but there are plenty of things going

1254.32 --> 1257.2
down in the world

1257.52 --> 1261.76
that are not just sad no those people

1261.28 --> 1265.9189999999999
that

1261.76 --> 1265.919
go ahead with this are horrific

1267.039 --> 1271.76
right and yeah anyway

1273.679 --> 1277.76
right after own benjamin also roxanne

1276.0 --> 1280.0
went live somewhere late in the evening

1277.76 --> 1282.96
roxanne globalist denier

1280.0 --> 1283.679
and she yeah she has this uh really woke

1282.96 --> 1285.8400000000001
show

1283.679 --> 1287.8400000000001
sort of an alternative news and she's

1285.84 --> 1289.76
been building this for some time and i'm

1287.84 --> 1292.1589999999999
gonna i mentioned it yesterday but they

1289.76 --> 1295.28
watched the guy i was really impressed

1292.159 --> 1297.7600000000002
they got a good flow going

1295.28 --> 1299.28
and i like it she is like she's really

1297.76 --> 1301.44
taking out

1299.28 --> 1303.6789999999999
interesting video clips and kind of like

1301.44 --> 1304.64
reports on what the news normally should

1303.679 --> 1307.8400000000001
be doing

1304.64 --> 1309.679
right and it's pretty cool

1307.84 --> 1311.28
sometimes it's not always super

1309.679 --> 1313.679
interesting i've seen it in the past

1311.28 --> 1315.84
where i got kind of bored to be honest

1313.679 --> 1318.48
but this time and yesterday was pretty

1315.84 --> 1320.799
damn good

1318.48 --> 1324.08
and they're always very active very

1320.799 --> 1326.08
concerned with protests and all that

1324.08 --> 1327.1999999999998
and really try to inform you with that

1326.08 --> 1330.32
it's good

1327.2 --> 1332.4
it's interesting and also yeah yeah i

1330.32 --> 1335.52
got a i found a clip

1332.4 --> 1337.679
through pretty shocking by the way

1335.52 --> 1339.6
you've probably seen it by now because

1337.679 --> 1341.679
it's it literally went everywhere i even

1339.6 --> 1343.12
saw it being played live on the alex

1341.679 --> 1346.3200000000002
jones show

1343.12 --> 1349.52
or the the war room that is

1346.32 --> 1349.76
and then because i found that i posted

1349.52 --> 1353.44
it

1349.76 --> 1355.44
in the master bee and also in the

1353.44 --> 1357.2
flat earth early bird chat because it

1355.44 --> 1360.4
was just this news article

1357.2 --> 1362.24
dutch news article about a german doctor

1360.4 --> 1364.3200000000002
that was just doing a live stream when

1362.24 --> 1366.32
he suddenly got violently uh

1364.32 --> 1369.4399999999998
arrested like in the middle of his

1366.32 --> 1372.799
livestream totally insane

1369.44 --> 1374.88
very creepy and yeah that

1372.799 --> 1376.799
that thing is really shocking because

1374.88 --> 1378.72
we've seen people getting arrested

1376.799 --> 1380.72
for no good reason before but just the

1378.72 --> 1383.919
way this happened

1380.72 --> 1386.159
my god this was just

1383.919 --> 1388.3200000000002
straight out of a world war ii movie

1386.159 --> 1389.8400000000001
almost except for of course the computer

1388.32 --> 1393.2
activity but

1389.84 --> 1393.6
that was just nuts roxanna also played

1393.2 --> 1397.039
it

1393.6 --> 1400.1589999999999
at the last part of her show

1397.039 --> 1402.24
i'll share the link it's all dutch

1400.159 --> 1404.64
article but at the bottom

1402.24 --> 1406.88
of the article there is a twitter post

1404.64 --> 1410.159
in which there is the

1406.88 --> 1411.3600000000001
the moment of the arrest so you can

1410.159 --> 1413.919
check it out yourself

1411.36 --> 1415.039
if you probably seen it by now i don't

1413.919 --> 1418.96
know how to find

1415.039 --> 1421.44
that video clip separated you might

1418.96 --> 1424.24
i don't know so i'm just linking to the

1421.44 --> 1424.24
news article

1427.36 --> 1434.6399999999999
right it's it's pretty freaky

1431.76 --> 1435.9
just literally they come they break open

1434.64 --> 1438.0
his door

1435.9 --> 1440.159
[Music]

1438.0 --> 1442.559
you hear them bashing and then they like

1440.159 --> 1446.0
scream

1442.559 --> 1448.72
rage and like hold him under

1446.0 --> 1449.84
gunshot constantly like get on the

1448.72 --> 1451.919
ground like

1449.84 --> 1455.039
he was a violent criminal or something

1451.919 --> 1455.039
totally insane

1455.279 --> 1461.84
totally crazy anyway

1459.039 --> 1461.84
yeah that happened

1462.32 --> 1466.08
very worrisome and also just what the

1465.679 --> 1468.72
[ __ ]

1466.08 --> 1470.84
is up with these police man what the

1468.72 --> 1474.08
[ __ ]

1470.84 --> 1476.8799999999999
like do they even realize that they are

1474.08 --> 1478.799
literally like nazi police right now

1476.88 --> 1482.5590000000002
literally and people are seeing it do

1478.799 --> 1482.559
they realize what they're doing

1482.96 --> 1489.1200000000001
are they doubling down on to death with

1486.159 --> 1493.1200000000001
the control situation like this

1489.12 --> 1493.12
because just [ __ ] up man

1499.52 --> 1505.279
like these these police officers must be

1502.08 --> 1508.3999999999999
having some really bad sleep

1505.279 --> 1511.36
when they do this sort of [ __ ] they must

1508.4 --> 1513.52
be like afraid so they're gonna just be

1511.36 --> 1516.799
pulled out of their houses one day and

1513.52 --> 1516.799
they probably will be

1516.96 --> 1529.8400000000001
for their extreme crime against the

1519.279 --> 1529.84
german people

1534.0 --> 1538.0
right and and with just with the

1535.679 --> 1542.72
freaking history that germany has

1538.0 --> 1544.48
it's so insane you know

1542.72 --> 1546.08
they've never had anything like that

1544.48 --> 1548.0
yeah they might be like oh [ __ ] what's

1546.08 --> 1549.12
going on no no no they have a freaking

1548.0 --> 1552.799
history

1549.12 --> 1556.559
of being nazi germany how the hell

1552.799 --> 1559.279
can you let this happen how the hell is

1556.559 --> 1559.279

1582.559 --> 1586.48
over all over you guys again

1587.36 --> 1592.7199999999998
i think everything that's been said is

1591.039 --> 1595.05
yeah i don't think that there's anything

1592.72 --> 1596.84
i can add to any of it

1595.05 --> 1600.08
[Music]

1596.84 --> 1602.799
right uh also did everybody see owen

1600.08 --> 1605.1999999999998
benjamin he showed yeah the sjw metal

1602.799 --> 1608.1589999999999
clip that was so epic man

1605.2 --> 1608.799
i showed it to my to my roommate and she

1608.159 --> 1612.4

1629.679 --> 1632.4

1668.96 --> 1671.679

and then i'll give it back is that okay

1697.36 --> 1699.9189999999999
here you go

1703.679 --> 1711.8400000000001
tell me when you've done it

1717.36 --> 1725.84
[Music]

1720.399 --> 1725.84
done it

1736.84 --> 1742.1589999999999
good

1739.6 --> 1742.1589999999999
all right

1746.32 --> 1749.52
it's on facebook as well

1750.88 --> 1755.7600000000002
yeah that clip yeah it's going around

1752.96 --> 1759.039
like wildfire

1755.76 --> 1762.799
and it should be because it's absolutely

1759.039 --> 1765.52
preposterous that that happened

1762.799 --> 1766.399
it's it's literally just a doctor that's

1765.52 --> 1768.24
doing

1766.399 --> 1771.84
live streams and in the middle of his

1768.24 --> 1775.44
live stream that just happens it's

1771.84 --> 1778.8799999999999
from the page you linked right

1775.44 --> 1781.8400000000001
the the first one right of the doctor

1778.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
or do you mean the

1782.88 --> 1785.7600000000002
the music clip

1792.559 --> 1796.6399999999999
i wonder if i could just play that video

1794.88 --> 1799.5200000000002
clip or if i would get a strike or

1796.64 --> 1799.5200000000002
something i don't know

1801.84 --> 1809.84
because it's 30 seconds

1809.919 --> 1814.88
but nah anyway the the clip is there in

1813.12 --> 1817.9189999999999
chat

1814.88 --> 1823.2
right did i link it

1817.919 --> 1826.3990000000001
the bit shoot wait

1823.2 --> 1826.3990000000001
where's my bit shoot link

1828.96 --> 1837.8400000000001
no i didn't post it yet okay okay

1832.32 --> 1837.84
here is it

1848.84 --> 1851.84
um

1862.84 --> 1865.84
hmm

1876.84 --> 1879.84
hmm

1891.12 --> 1893.84
anyway

1896.32 --> 1907.84
yeah a busy day yesterday didn't go to

1899.36 --> 1907.84
bed too late

1914.559 --> 1921.84
i feel actually kind of calm now

1933.2 --> 1936.64
all right by the way i did also take a

1935.84 --> 1939.6789999999999
look at

1936.64 --> 1941.919
jaron's d live stream at one point

1939.679 --> 1943.3600000000001
it was just really weird to hear over

1941.919 --> 1946.48
there

1943.36 --> 1948.0
it was a new some guy looked little kind

1946.48 --> 1950.64
of weird

1948.0 --> 1951.44
and he was at some point just saying

1950.64 --> 1953.8400000000001
like

1951.44 --> 1955.76
yeah i'm so glad you're not just talking

1953.84 --> 1957.12
about flat earth anymore because that

1955.76 --> 1963.84
was so boring

1957.12 --> 1963.84
like what the hell

1974.799 --> 1982.6399999999999
it's not like it's over or anything

1978.24 --> 1982.64
there's a lot more to figure out

1985.36 --> 1988.7199999999998
karen has always covered other subjects

1988.08 --> 1990.96
yeah yeah

1988.72 --> 1992.72
well he's always brought them up if it

1990.96 --> 1995.1200000000001
was like actual

1992.72 --> 1995.1200000000001
i know

2001.36 --> 2006.24
like if it's like a current thing

2004.08 --> 2008.24
something he recently discovered

2006.24 --> 2010.48
right fe never boring that's what i

2008.24 --> 2010.48
think

2010.96 --> 2014.88
i don't think it's boring i don't even

2012.88 --> 2017.3600000000001
think it's boring at this point

2014.88 --> 2018.0800000000002
i realize this compared to an

2017.36 --> 2020.4799999999998
alternative

2018.08 --> 2023.039
to finding an alternative i still think

2020.48 --> 2028.159
that actually listening

2023.039 --> 2030.08
to nathan why not about coriola's effect

2028.159 --> 2032.24
and how ballers don't get it

2030.08 --> 2033.76
i think that's actually a lot more

2032.24 --> 2036.32
amusing than anything else

2033.76 --> 2038.64
and i've heard over a thousand hours of

2036.32 --> 2042.08
that by now

2038.64 --> 2042.5590000000002
you know why it's amusing because it's

2042.08 --> 2046.1589999999999
still

2042.559 --> 2049.44
very relevant because it's literally

2046.159 --> 2052.48
a mental break that's happening live

2049.44 --> 2054.48
constantly and that is kind of

2052.48 --> 2056.079
fascinating it's also fascinating to

2054.48 --> 2058.639
just to see how people

2056.079 --> 2059.52
respond to that especially that have the

2058.639 --> 2062.879
coriolis

2059.52 --> 2066.24
viruses call it

2062.879 --> 2066.24
i don't have a backup channel

2067.359 --> 2071.359
although i have erwinian there the other

2069.76 --> 2072.639
account but there's nothing really on it

2071.359 --> 2074.399
a couple of videos

2072.639 --> 2076.56
that's it i don't really do anything

2074.399 --> 2079.2
with it i used it as a sock account when

2076.56 --> 2079.2
i got blocked

2086.839 --> 2091.359
originally

2089.679 --> 2103.839
you and your reference frames have been

2091.359 --> 2103.839
ruined thanks dan yeah

2112.75 --> 2117.839
[Music]

2114.839 --> 2117.839
so

2118.079 --> 2125.2000000000003
right so you know the whole thing is

2122.88 --> 2127.04
when you look at especially how germany

2125.2 --> 2128.16
is dealing with the situation and how

2127.04 --> 2130.56
they are utilizing

2128.16 --> 2133.52
sort of the police state compared to

2130.56 --> 2137.2799999999997
other countries they seem to be worse

2133.52 --> 2138.079
i think now that is a pretty telling

2137.28 --> 2141.119
sign

2138.079 --> 2144.88
historically because usually

2141.119 --> 2146.48
when that is forward that means that

2144.88 --> 2150.88
there is like a

2146.48 --> 2150.88
that's a panic reaction from the state

2151.76 --> 2159.44
because of the consequences of causing

2155.599 --> 2162.56
like acting more autocratic

2159.44 --> 2165.04
like a dictator that's literally a panic

2162.56 --> 2167.839
move because otherwise things will not

2165.04 --> 2169.92
be tanable for whatever they're doing

2167.839 --> 2171.599
so it's actually kind of a tell-taling

2169.92 --> 2176.48
sign when you think of it

2171.599 --> 2180.32
at a distance historically that

2176.48 --> 2183.599
germany might be like about to

2180.32 --> 2187.839
fall and people don't even literally

2183.599 --> 2187.839
realize it or maybe inside they do

2188.4 --> 2192.4
because these kind of moves are just

2192.56 --> 2195.7599999999998
yeah a sign that they're really losing

2195.04 --> 2198.4
grip and

2195.76 --> 2199.8390000000004
that there's heavy urgency behind it

2198.4 --> 2201.76
otherwise

2199.839 --> 2203.359
you're not just gonna do that and

2201.76 --> 2205.44
literally turn

2203.359 --> 2206.72
the people and the world against you

2205.44 --> 2208.88
like that because

2206.72 --> 2210.72
everybody got to see this doctor getting

2208.88 --> 2212.0
arrested and there's not a person out

2210.72 --> 2214.64
there in the world

2212.0 --> 2216.32
except for maybe yeah people that are

2214.64 --> 2217.92
part of the medical industrial complex

2216.32 --> 2220.6400000000003
that are gonna think

2217.92 --> 2221.44
this is okay it's not a person in the

2220.64 --> 2222.96
world

2221.44 --> 2224.7200000000003
that's gonna think that that's okay

2222.96 --> 2226.079
they're all gonna be reminded about

2224.72 --> 2229.68
freaking world war ii

2226.079 --> 2232.2400000000002
nazi germany this is ultra bad

2229.68 --> 2233.44
for the image of germany so the only

2232.24 --> 2237.839
reason they could have ever

2233.44 --> 2237.839
done this is out of panic

2238.24 --> 2245.7599999999998
allow this out of panic to try to

2242.16 --> 2248.0
create a short term mind control over

2245.76 --> 2250.0
the people a deterrent to stop it from

2248.0 --> 2253.44
further destabilizing

2250.0 --> 2253.44
of what's actually going on

2253.76 --> 2259.119
deutsche bank yeah could be i'll bet

2256.4 --> 2262.4
they're in deep trouble for some time

2259.119 --> 2262.4
i've heard the signs of that

2264.16 --> 2268.3199999999997
so a tipping point well i'm not saying

2266.16 --> 2270.3999999999996
that it's literally going to break at

2268.32 --> 2275.28
any moment it's just that

2270.4 --> 2278.32
when it tightens up it usually

2275.28 --> 2281.2000000000003
reaches a a crossroads

2278.32 --> 2282.48
and it tightens up it can usually only

2281.2 --> 2285.2799999999997
tighten up further

2282.48 --> 2286.56
and it then it reaches that crossroad

2285.28 --> 2288.7200000000003
point

2286.56 --> 2291.599
where it where it will actually collapse

2288.72 --> 2291.5989999999997
one way or the other

2293.119 --> 2297.52
in ways you could you could say that

2296.0 --> 2299.839
something like that

2297.52 --> 2303.359
maybe slower is also happening with the

2299.839 --> 2305.2
united states but in germany

2303.359 --> 2306.7999999999997
yeah they're really just gone over the

2305.2 --> 2309.839
border yeah yeah by the way

2306.8 --> 2314.1600000000003
thank you julio pabanol we'll check out

2309.839 --> 2314.16
the paypal i did not miss that

2322.96 --> 2327.839
yes thank you oh

2329.52 --> 2334.56
that is really good thank you very much

2338.839 --> 2344.24
nice

2340.64 --> 2347.359
all right thank you very much for that

2344.24 --> 2355.839
julio pabin you

2347.359 --> 2355.839
are ace

2366.839 --> 2369.839
okay

2384.88 --> 2387.119
right

2389.76 --> 2393.44
by the way i think that with the whole

2392.16 --> 2395.839
the german bank

2393.44 --> 2398.32
what is really causing all that you know

2395.839 --> 2401.7599999999998
it is globalism that does this

2398.32 --> 2406.079
you know how they

2401.76 --> 2406.4
have like a very basic backdrop idea of

2406.079 --> 2410.1600000000003
that

2406.4 --> 2413.44
if you just open up a bank and literally

2410.16 --> 2414.319
spend everything humanly possible on the

2413.44 --> 2416.8
world

2414.319 --> 2419.04
that then the world will grow and then

2416.8 --> 2422.0
eventually

2419.04 --> 2423.04
sort of balance it out unfortunately

2422.0 --> 2425.2
however

2423.04 --> 2426.96
in reality it doesn't really work that

2425.2 --> 2429.359
way yeah it's pretty cool

2426.96 --> 2430.64
making being generous with the rest of

2429.359 --> 2433.7599999999998
the world

2430.64 --> 2435.359
and it does help a little at least on

2433.76 --> 2437.599
the short run

2435.359 --> 2439.68
but eventually it does usually end up

2437.599 --> 2440.2400000000002
with the just that country that went for

2439.68 --> 2443.5989999999997
it

2440.24 --> 2445.4399999999996
completely imploding so yeah it's

2443.599 --> 2448.7200000000003
actually kind of parasitic

2445.44 --> 2452.0
to do that globalists move in

2448.72 --> 2455.2
sway everybody with their idealism being

2452.0 --> 2458.319
generous and nice and even will

2455.2 --> 2458.8799999999997
like put christ in front of people and

2458.319 --> 2460.56
say

2458.88 --> 2462.319
yeah you have to be like that you just

2460.56 --> 2465.44
give it all away

2462.319 --> 2466.96
they will be that [ __ ] nasty i know

2465.44 --> 2469.04
they will

2466.96 --> 2471.839
some of them will they will actually use

2469.04 --> 2473.839
that abuse that

2471.839 --> 2476.72
just because it's convenient and it'll

2473.839 --> 2480.0
work because they're [ __ ] psychopaths

2476.72 --> 2484.3999999999996
but eventually yeah it is

2480.0 --> 2486.319
going to implode and then it's over

2484.4 --> 2488.319
like it's literally going to turn into a

2486.319 --> 2490.88
hell hole and that is what globalism

2488.319 --> 2490.88
really is

2492.839 --> 2497.04
globalism

2494.16 --> 2497.7599999999998
like manipulates everybody to join it

2497.04 --> 2500.88
and then

2497.76 --> 2503.8390000000004
you end up sacrificing yourself

2500.88 --> 2506.1600000000003
for everyone else the problem is

2503.839 --> 2508.64
everyone is sacrificing themselves for

2506.16 --> 2509.359
everyone else while the grabblers at the

2508.64 --> 2512.319
top

2509.359 --> 2513.04
scoop up all those profits that the

2512.319 --> 2515.2799999999997
people

2513.04 --> 2517.599
sacrificing themselves for the world

2515.28 --> 2521.3590000000004
think they are giving to other people

2517.599 --> 2522.4
when in fact all that [ __ ] eventually

2521.359 --> 2525.68
ends up

2522.4 --> 2528.1600000000003
in one giant bag of the grabblers

2525.68 --> 2537.839
that's what it really is and people need

2528.16 --> 2537.839
to realize that

2547.44 --> 2551.68
just like how so many tax systems are

2550.079 --> 2555.04
set up

2551.68 --> 2558.7599999999998
to not even pay off the debt but just

2555.04 --> 2561.52
hand over the freaking money as

2558.76 --> 2564.7200000000003
government-based social welfare for

2561.52 --> 2568.079
corporations and institutions

2564.72 --> 2571.839
globalism does that and people don't

2568.079 --> 2575.3590000000004
even know it that

2571.839 --> 2578.56
money that is standardized taxation

2575.359 --> 2582.48
in places whatever the tax might

2578.56 --> 2586.0789999999997
is literally not paying off the debt

2582.48 --> 2586.48
at all not even close and is literally

2586.079 --> 2589.3590000000004
being

2586.48 --> 2590.64
handed over to corporations and

2589.359 --> 2597.04
institutions

2590.64 --> 2597.04
as well fair unconditional often

2597.68 --> 2606.56
you understand in this situation is also

2601.2 --> 2609.1189999999997
in the netherlands it's terrible

2606.56 --> 2612.0789999999997
now despite that the netherlands does

2609.119 --> 2615.92
seem to be doing financially good

2612.079 --> 2615.92
seems to i don't really know

2616.8 --> 2620.96
but the taxes there yeah there's plenty

2620.24 --> 2624.0
of taxes

2620.96 --> 2625.2
and rarely any of it goes to pay off

2624.0 --> 2628.8
debt

2625.2 --> 2631.5989999999997
pay off national debt it doesn't happen

2628.8 --> 2631.599
it doesn't really

2632.16 --> 2635.359
a lot of it is then pulled in in other

2634.64 --> 2639.52
ways

2635.359 --> 2643.5989999999997
so they do like to even out the the debt

2639.52 --> 2647.119
because we're dutch money very important

2643.599 --> 2650.4
but at the same time there's just tax

2647.119 --> 2652.079
[ __ ] incorporated where the tax

2650.4 --> 2654.319
doesn't even end up in the hands of

2652.079 --> 2655.52
government it's just being given away to

2654.319 --> 2658.24
corporations and

2655.52 --> 2658.24
institutions

2661.359 --> 2666.4
corporate socialism in other words

2674.839 --> 2677.839
technocracy

2683.68 --> 2690.319
right and it's what happens when people

2688.24 --> 2691.5989999999997
don't have control over their government

2690.319 --> 2694.0
then the government

2691.599 --> 2695.3590000000004
political cl starts the politician

2694.0 --> 2698.319
starts to form their own

2695.359 --> 2700.4
class with their own spells to sway

2698.319 --> 2701.839
their followers to just blindly trust

2700.4 --> 2703.76
them because they're so smart

2701.839 --> 2705.2799999999997
they know exactly what to say they're

2703.76 --> 2709.44
always ahead of the curve

2705.28 --> 2712.6400000000003
and then the people believe that

2709.44 --> 2714.88
refrain from correcting them

2712.64 --> 2716.96
and then they end up doing that sort of

2714.88 --> 2719.44
[ __ ] building these systems

2716.96 --> 2720.079
where government where tax money is

2719.44 --> 2724.7200000000003
literally

2720.079 --> 2727.28
funneled into the hands of institutions

2724.72 --> 2730.0789999999997
private institutions often and

2727.28 --> 2730.079
corporations

2731.599 --> 2737.599
it's like i don't know what you call

2735.359 --> 2737.5989999999997
that

2739.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
government condoned theft

2743.04 --> 2747.839
you could say

2763.75 --> 2775.839
[Music]

2765.2 --> 2775.839
all right

2778.88 --> 2782.6400000000003
well george stand for taxes not

2781.76 --> 2785.8390000000004
necessarily

2782.64 --> 2789.839
taxes are part of a social contract

2785.839 --> 2794.0789999999997
but when taxes literally

2789.839 --> 2795.119
are given away to private institutions

2794.079 --> 2798.079
and

2795.119 --> 2798.079
corporations

2798.88 --> 2803.52
like on the like incorporated into a

2801.76 --> 2805.76
standardized system

2803.52 --> 2807.52
you know because it was one thing if it

2805.76 --> 2809.76
was just like okay

2807.52 --> 2812.0
we are going to have to do this like

2809.76 --> 2813.8390000000004
renovate this or build this

2812.0 --> 2815.839
and then people will be like yeah yeah

2813.839 --> 2816.88
that's a good idea okay so then

2815.839 --> 2820.0789999999997
government is gonna

2816.88 --> 2821.6800000000003
find the corporations hire them and yeah

2820.079 --> 2822.48
that's gonna cost some and then that's

2821.68 --> 2826.0789999999997
gonna be

2822.48 --> 2828.72
paid back you got a bill right well

2826.079 --> 2830.0
that's kind of normal that's really how

2828.72 --> 2833.1189999999997
it should happen

2830.0 --> 2836.4
but in reality often

2833.119 --> 2840.559
they sneak in not like that not a

2836.4 --> 2842.559
bill no it's like oh yeah we can't

2840.559 --> 2844.0
find the budget to do this so we're

2842.559 --> 2846.0
gonna make a handshake

2844.0 --> 2847.28
deal with the corporations that will do

2846.0 --> 2850.4
it for free

2847.28 --> 2858.559
and they will just get a permanent tax

2850.4 --> 2861.2000000000003
revenue basically

2858.559 --> 2863.3590000000004
and people don't even realize it often

2861.2 --> 2865.7599999999998
that that is really what's being built

2863.359 --> 2868.0
they just think oh we're so generous of

2865.76 --> 2869.28
them so generous that they'll just give

2868.0 --> 2871.839
it to us

2869.28 --> 2875.44
so nice so we have it now oh it'll be

2871.839 --> 2875.44
alright don't think about it

2889.359 --> 2891.5989999999997
right

2896.559 --> 2900.96
i don't know exactly what what that even

2898.88 --> 2902.319
is is that like does it fall under

2900.96 --> 2904.8
fascism

2902.319 --> 2907.2799999999997
because it is kind of like corporations

2904.8 --> 2910.8
and government working together to

2907.28 --> 2913.599
yeah enslave the public

2910.8 --> 2914.1600000000003
isn't it isn't that technically what the

2913.599 --> 2916.96
foundation

2914.16 --> 2919.359
of fascism really is that specific setup

2916.96 --> 2921.119
conspiracy

2919.359 --> 2922.5589999999997
government corporations against the

2921.119 --> 2929.839
people

2922.559 --> 2929.8390000000004
also violating their rights like that

2932.0 --> 2935.2
they're god-given rights

2936.88 --> 2940.079
right so yeah maybe i should just call

2939.04 --> 2942.4
it fascist

2940.079 --> 2943.8390000000004
the problem is that even using that word

2942.4 --> 2947.52
now

2943.839 --> 2949.44
almost feels to me like

2947.52 --> 2951.68
like i would be associated with a

2949.44 --> 2955.76
freaking sjw or antifa

2951.68 --> 2959.2799999999997
[ __ ] they are fascists by the way

2955.76 --> 2961.8390000000004
antifa and and that's made me

2959.28 --> 2963.76
like hesitant to even use that freaking

2961.839 --> 2965.7599999999998
word anymore

2963.76 --> 2968.8
i almost yeah i'd prefer to just call

2965.76 --> 2968.8
them technocrats

2968.839 --> 2971.839
dictators

2975.119 --> 2978.6400000000003
yeah the communist revolutionaries all

2978.24 --> 2981.04
these

2978.64 --> 2983.7599999999998
terminologies it's just that fascist now

2981.04 --> 2986.16
is just they they destroyed that word

2983.76 --> 2988.079
by corrupting it turning it inside out

2986.16 --> 2990.72
so bad

2988.079 --> 2992.319
that even complaining about fascism just

2990.72 --> 2995.04
makes you associate with

2992.319 --> 2996.4
demons now that's what they did with

2995.04 --> 2999.44
that

2996.4 --> 3000.8
that's the true damage of [ __ ]

2999.44 --> 3003.76
marxism

3000.8 --> 3006.0
turning everything inside out they take

3003.76 --> 3009.28
legitimate things that they foresee

3006.0 --> 3010.88
will be a problem in the future and then

3009.28 --> 3013.92
they defuse it

3010.88 --> 3016.88
by destroying it with false

3013.92 --> 3018.0
[ __ ] turning it inside out the word the

3016.88 --> 3020.319
meaning

3018.0 --> 3021.119
making everybody hate anything to do

3020.319 --> 3024.88
with that

3021.119 --> 3027.599
so badly that when the situation then

3024.88 --> 3029.6800000000003
eventually arrives as predicted by those

3027.599 --> 3032.079
that have done that

3029.68 --> 3032.8799999999997
people will be hesitant to even point it

3032.079 --> 3035.04
out for

3032.88 --> 3036.079
fear of association with those

3035.04 --> 3039.359
disgusting

3036.079 --> 3041.76
bastards that did that

3039.359 --> 3042.72
it's part of the trick it's a standard

3041.76 --> 3045.76
[ __ ] trick

3042.72 --> 3046.72
by the way of marxism that's why i hate

3045.76 --> 3050.4
it

3046.72 --> 3053.5989999999997
it destroys everything that is good

3050.4 --> 3056.7200000000003
everything is systematically

3053.599 --> 3059.76
destroys everything that is good

3056.72 --> 3063.68
and it is too

3059.76 --> 3064.1600000000003
successful at it and that's why it needs

3063.68 --> 3068.16
to be

3064.16 --> 3071.2
erased from human history forever

3068.16 --> 3071.2
everything about it

3077.64 --> 3081.2
[Music]

3079.359 --> 3084.64
unfortunately that's not gonna happen

3081.2 --> 3084.64
i'm pretty convinced that it's not

3085.359 --> 3089.68
because yeah the demons aren't letting

3087.2 --> 3093.52
it go it's too much power

3089.68 --> 3096.16
they literally lo like

3093.52 --> 3098.24
launch themselves forth to grab that

3096.16 --> 3101.2
ring

3098.24 --> 3102.72
the power was there it was conjured it

3101.2 --> 3105.68
was devised

3102.72 --> 3106.7999999999997
and the people that have used it are now

3105.68 --> 3109.52
demons

3106.8 --> 3110.079
and they will not get out they don't

3109.52 --> 3112.559
want to

3110.079 --> 3113.599
they will grab for that ring even if

3112.559 --> 3116.96
that means

3113.599 --> 3119.839
plunging themselves right into a volcano

3116.96 --> 3119.839
do you understand

3120.0 --> 3139.839
marxism is as straightforward demonic

3124.24 --> 3139.839
as anything ever devised

3150.839 --> 3153.839
do

3164.839 --> 3167.839
ugh

3174.29 --> 3177.44
[Music]

3178.839 --> 3182.48
nope

3180.16 --> 3182.48
nah

3184.0 --> 3189.2
no you don't get it to manoid

3187.119 --> 3190.8
i was referring to the lord of the rings

3189.2 --> 3192.64
it's it's symbolic

3190.8 --> 3196.079
and that lord of the rings was also

3192.64 --> 3199.1189999999997
symbolic it's about the psychology

3196.079 --> 3199.8390000000004
it's about being obsessed with the power

3199.119 --> 3203.359
so much

3199.839 --> 3205.52
that you literally just for the idea of

3203.359 --> 3207.839
having it for a few seconds would kill

3205.52 --> 3211.599
yourself

3207.839 --> 3213.68
that that is what it is

3211.599 --> 3215.28
because it is that powerful and it is

3213.68 --> 3217.839
that evil

3215.28 --> 3220.0
and once you get addicted to it it will

3217.839 --> 3223.04
never let you go

3220.0 --> 3225.68
you will become obsessed with power

3223.04 --> 3225.68
and death

3226.88 --> 3235.04
[Music]

3232.4 --> 3236.1600000000003

3235.04 --> 3239.52
literally see

3236.16 --> 3241.7599999999998

do you understand they see human beings

3241.76 --> 3244.88
as pinatas

3245.359 --> 3249.5989999999997
how much money can we crush out of that

3248.079 --> 3254.2400000000002
human being

3249.599 --> 3256.7200000000003
how much that's how they see it

3254.24 --> 3256.72

3259.28 --> 3269.44
can i see people like pinatas

3264.8 --> 3272.559
have no regrets whatsoever

3269.44 --> 3279.839
