83.6 --> 89.6
yeah starting a little early today to

86.56 --> 92.0
compensate for previous

89.6 --> 92.0
shows

93.28 --> 99.119
today the weather is yeah it's kind of

96.32 --> 102.079
similar to yesterday

99.119 --> 103.6
a little bit more clouds maybe but

102.079 --> 107.36
overall it's pretty nice and

103.6 --> 107.36
the sun when it comes through is nice

107.6 --> 115.83999999999999
surprisingly warm

110.64 --> 115.84
but yeah right now it's cloudy

117.439 --> 119.75899999999999
alright

121.84 --> 132.239
so ah

128.56 --> 134.48
i got tamara coffee

132.239 --> 134.48000000000002
tea

140.16 --> 144.879
and yeah there's not many people in chat

142.0 --> 148.239
just yet uh bandsaw bandit

144.879 --> 152.07999999999998
got in early uh and i think yeah there's

148.239 --> 152.08
some other streams going on as well

153.04 --> 160.16
it's not very convenient

157.04 --> 160.16
right so anyway

160.319 --> 162.95899999999997
yesterday

164.8 --> 169.28
yeah yesterday's show was quite a quite

167.36 --> 172.87900000000002
a blast

169.28 --> 176.239
in the sense that i was blasting away

172.879 --> 179.44
and i definitely got some attention

176.239 --> 181.519
so i took note through some other people

179.44 --> 184.07999999999998
as well

181.519 --> 185.84
because yeah yeah the stream was choked

184.08 --> 187.519
it's no surprise

185.84 --> 191.599
let's see where it's currently at it was

187.519 --> 194.8
choked actually three separate times

191.599 --> 198.07999999999998
but oh right yeah it's now at

194.8 --> 202.15900000000002
to avoid 20 52 down votes it was

198.08 --> 202.959
actually at like 40 down votes even

202.159 --> 205.2
degraded

202.959 --> 206.08
for some reason yeah but despite that

205.2 --> 208.07999999999998
when you compare

206.08 --> 211.04000000000002
yesterday's show which i call the ball

208.08 --> 214.4
religion is going down go boom boom

211.04 --> 215.2
compared to the previous shows and this

214.4 --> 219.20000000000002
one

215.2 --> 222.72
pretty quickly had 325 views and then it

219.2 --> 226.159
i don't know it stopped just stopped so

222.72 --> 229.44
suddenly 325 people watched

226.159 --> 232.79899999999998
and yeah hasn't grown since

229.44 --> 236.159
last 10 hours for some reason

232.799 --> 236.799
it's just not not rigged at all but yeah

236.159 --> 239.76
they did

236.799 --> 241.36
it did get more views but yeah they

239.76 --> 243.879
choked it anyway

241.36 --> 245.04000000000002
because yeah the streams before that had

243.879 --> 248.959
203

245.04 --> 252.319
and 236 276

248.959 --> 254.0
280 and that's like five days ago so

252.319 --> 257.84
yeah people do watch my show

254.0 --> 259.84
afterward so that counter goes up

257.84 --> 262.71999999999997
but yesterday's show apparently got a

259.84 --> 262.71999999999997
lot of attention

263.44 --> 267.68
yeah well deserve it because yeah i

266.88 --> 271.36
completely

267.68 --> 271.36
mauled the ballers

272.56 --> 276.24
and yeah there's a lot of them that

274.32 --> 278.479
didn't like that so i've got

276.24 --> 280.08
more troll comments and even some

278.479 --> 283.199
watchers that seem to be

280.08 --> 286.15999999999997
outraged all of a sudden

283.199 --> 287.199
because i expressed that i want all

286.16 --> 291.36
trolls

287.199 --> 296.08000000000004
to die right that's not saying that i

291.36 --> 299.759
am going to kill them nor is it that i

296.08 --> 303.12
like yeah

299.759 --> 306.96000000000004
gonna plan anything like that

303.12 --> 310.24
it's just a genuine feeling that i have

306.96 --> 311.75899999999996
not very happy that i have this you know

310.24 --> 314.56
i just don't know really what to do

311.759 --> 317.199
about it just keeps on building

314.56 --> 318.16
and yeah i like to be very forgiving and

317.199 --> 321.36
understanding and

318.16 --> 325.6
hey i do understand why they're doing it

321.36 --> 326.96000000000004
it's just that

325.6 --> 328.72
yeah i'm having a little bit more

326.96 --> 331.44
trouble forgiving that

328.72 --> 333.52000000000004
because i went through the same things

331.44 --> 336.96
all of it

333.52 --> 338.88
and yeah it was tough but i got out of

336.96 --> 340.63899999999995
it

338.88 --> 342.4
and i stopped all the behaviors i

340.639 --> 344.24
stopped all of those things

342.4 --> 346.15999999999997
and there's just people out there that

344.24 --> 349.52
don't

346.16 --> 353.03900000000004
they're unrelenting unrelenting

349.52 --> 354.88
liars and yeah i

353.039 --> 357.199
i don't really know what to do about

354.88 --> 361.3
that because

357.199 --> 364.369
it arouses sense of vengeance in me

361.3 --> 364.369
[Music]

364.8 --> 369.84000000000003
because they're agitating things

368.0 --> 372.16
just like how they waste their time they

369.84 --> 375.52
agitate people

372.16 --> 380.96000000000004
and yeah is that really something we

375.52 --> 384.0
should be having around you know

380.96 --> 385.84
because i bet that throughout history

384.0 --> 388.72
there were always groups of people

385.84 --> 389.28
bottom dwellers that would just start to

388.72 --> 391.91900000000004
nag

389.28 --> 394.63899999999995
and agitate people perhaps even like rob

391.919 --> 398.79999999999995
them i guess because they weren't

394.639 --> 403.44
provided for by some

398.8 --> 403.44
state funding or whatever right

403.68 --> 408.319
and yeah those people would eventually

405.759 --> 411.52000000000004
be taken care of

408.319 --> 412.96000000000004
well it's not really happening not like

411.52 --> 415.12
that

412.96 --> 416.479
it seems rather that these people are

415.12 --> 419.44
just

416.479 --> 420.0
propped up to become as bad as possible

419.44 --> 422.71999999999997
and then

420.0 --> 424.0
over a long period of time somehow burn

422.72 --> 426.72
themselves out

424.0 --> 430.16
that's very nice it's very nice but yeah

426.72 --> 437.84000000000003
we're all getting subjected to that

430.16 --> 437.84000000000003
so it's not exactly a win-win situation

438.56 --> 447.68
and yeah i i had some needs yesterday to

442.08 --> 451.84
just do exactly what i did

447.68 --> 451.84000000000003
and i think it got some attention

452.4 --> 459.84
so i see more people in chat now

456.4 --> 463.28
obamacall good servant

459.84 --> 463.28
michael o'rourke good to see you

463.68 --> 468.8
yeah anyway

473.35 --> 478.08000000000004
[Music]

475.039 --> 480.96
yeah after the show though i was

478.08 --> 482.24
quite exhilarated at least for a while i

480.96 --> 485.84
was just very

482.24 --> 487.36
happy like i got that off my chest

485.84 --> 489.84
yeah i know this good servant thank you

487.36 --> 493.84000000000003
for linking up in skype

489.84 --> 493.84
hello roger

500.72 --> 506.24
right oh yeah uh anyway yeah on the list

504.08 --> 507.75899999999996
as i don't know when did he start up

506.24 --> 510.319
somewhere in the evening

507.759 --> 511.68
own benjamin went live again that was

510.319 --> 513.36
pretty good i

511.68 --> 515.2
didn't make any specific notes it could

513.36 --> 521.839
be that i got in a little late

515.2 --> 521.839
i don't remember um

525.279 --> 530.56
our time remembering everything that i

527.36 --> 530.5600000000001
was doing yesterday

532.959 --> 542.8
again yeah it did watch like a movie

536.959 --> 548.64
but yeah kind of left a bad taste

542.8 --> 553.519
like it's uh is it uh

548.64 --> 557.12
what's his name again is it

553.519 --> 558.72
seth rogen i think

557.12 --> 563.839
let me check him out no it's probably

558.72 --> 563.839
not him

564.8 --> 577.8389999999999
no it's not him definitely not him uh

568.56 --> 577.8389999999999
what's his name again

580.399 --> 585.279
yeah sorry it's seth macfarlane it knew

583.68 --> 587.5999999999999
it was a seth

585.279 --> 589.2
right that guy he made a movie and it's

587.6 --> 592.5600000000001
all about him

589.2 --> 592.88
in the wild wild west a million ways to

592.56 --> 595.279
die

592.88 --> 596.88
in the well in the west and yeah at

595.279 --> 599.04
funny moments but it's also

596.88 --> 600.24
kind of disgusting and outrageous and

599.04 --> 602.88
there were some like

600.24 --> 604.16
really revolting people in that movie as

602.88 --> 606.079
well

604.16 --> 608.8
supposed to be funny or something and

606.079 --> 608.8
that just like

610.0 --> 613.76
i don't know exactly what he was trying

611.92 --> 619.1999999999999
to accomplish

613.76 --> 620.92
but the movie yeah had grabblers in it

619.2 --> 622.6400000000001
and that kind of ruined it for me

620.92 --> 624.7199999999999
[Music]

622.64 --> 626.64
although you know there were some kind

624.72 --> 628.9590000000001
of funny things about it you know it

626.64 --> 632.64
wasn't an entire waste of time but

628.959 --> 635.68
yeah meh it is corny a bit

632.64 --> 638.64
but then again not really

635.68 --> 642.64
because he just tore things out of

638.64 --> 645.279
normalcy yeah it was absurdistic

642.64 --> 646.0
but yeah there was just some really

645.279 --> 650.16
revolting

646.0 --> 650.16
people in there disgusting things

650.32 --> 653.0400000000001
i don't know man

654.399 --> 658.16
i was actually considering not even

656.16 --> 660.0
mentioning it you know sometimes i watch

658.16 --> 662.3199999999999
movies and i just don't even talk about

660.0 --> 664.079
it because i just think they're not very

662.32 --> 668.0790000000001
noteworthy

664.079 --> 675.8389999999999
and this was kind of on the border but

668.079 --> 675.8389999999999
yeah that happened then

686.839 --> 692.1600000000001
um

689.44 --> 692.1600000000001
not too much

692.64 --> 696.3199999999999
he should have stayed with family guy

698.16 --> 702.8
did you know he also made like this

700.0 --> 705.839
weird star trek version

702.8 --> 708.88
is a separate star trek universe

705.839 --> 710.8800000000001
of his making it's like more about

708.88 --> 714.959
squirting and

710.88 --> 717.36
and trans fluid genderism and all that

714.959 --> 718.399
i thought it was actually kind of

717.36 --> 722.16
interesting

718.399 --> 722.88
but again it's so liberal promoting and

722.16 --> 726.88
that's just

722.88 --> 726.88
you but

730.639 --> 735.2
no you didn't know that

741.92 --> 745.519
like at the time that came out it was

743.839 --> 747.44
sort of competing with star trek

745.519 --> 750.079
discovery

747.44 --> 751.44
and i actually thought that his series

750.079 --> 754.079
was just better

751.44 --> 756.0
it was just smoother it wasn't so

754.079 --> 760.16
freaking

756.0 --> 763.6
like uh seizure inducing

760.16 --> 765.6
flashy as discovery was

763.6 --> 765.98
so i actually just liked his version

765.6 --> 769.12
better

765.98 --> 774.639
[Laughter]

769.12 --> 774.639
hey gaining wisdom all right so

777.36 --> 780.32
uh i'm a little

781.36 --> 784.32
a little drained

785.2 --> 788.9590000000001
oh yeah yeah i forgot to make that i

787.68 --> 791.76
also

788.959 --> 794.0
visited paula's hangout by the

791.76 --> 797.36
literalist

794.0 --> 797.36
talking about the rapture

798.839 --> 804.399
and yeah

802.48 --> 806.5600000000001
i should put down a lot of details about

804.399 --> 806.56
it

806.8 --> 813.279
and yeah i'm i'm just wondering like

810.72 --> 814.24
right so hypothetically if that's going

813.279 --> 816.72
to happen

814.24 --> 818.399
within our lifetime and i don't know

816.72 --> 820.24
there's all these suggestions that

818.399 --> 823.04
that's supposed to happen but again

820.24 --> 823.519
what about the larpocalypse like some

823.04 --> 827.8389999999999
things

823.519 --> 829.76
can simply be all be man done

827.839 --> 831.0400000000001
if they wanted to because they're

829.76 --> 833.92
luciferians and they

831.04 --> 835.12
mock the bible and perhaps they mock it

833.92 --> 837.5999999999999
by

835.12 --> 839.199
creating a fake apocalypse now they

837.6 --> 841.0400000000001
could take that very far

839.199 --> 844.56
but yeah there are definitely some

841.04 --> 846.48
supernatural elements to the rapture

844.56 --> 849.4399999999999
that i don't think man is going to be

846.48 --> 849.44
able to fake that

850.399 --> 854.839
although i could be wrong but it just

852.88 --> 857.279
seems extremely

854.839 --> 859.839
unlikely and the impact would be

857.279 --> 862.72
dramatic anyway

859.839 --> 866.1600000000001
so yeah i'm wondering like okay would i

862.72 --> 869.1990000000001
be raptured am i really a christian

866.16 --> 873.36
you know i i have like

869.199 --> 877.4399999999999
i have some negative yeah things

873.36 --> 880.639
to me and i'm trying to figure out

877.44 --> 880.639
where's that coming from

882.56 --> 889.68
and like how do i resolve this how do i

886.56 --> 892.8
come to peace with it and

889.68 --> 896.88
every time i try to figure it out i just

892.8 --> 900.0
know i learned that i i can't

896.88 --> 901.76
it's just gonna be this

900.0 --> 903.44
and i'm gonna have to figure it out

901.76 --> 907.4399999999999
every single time

903.44 --> 907.44
just to get by and that

908.0 --> 915.199
yeah that doesn't exactly make me

911.68 --> 917.3599999999999
very happy so i then try to forget about

915.199 --> 921.199
it

917.36 --> 924.399
just try to keep doing my best

921.199 --> 927.279
and hey in all my

924.399 --> 929.36
endeavors i really try to keep truth at

927.279 --> 932.8
the top of my priority list

929.36 --> 935.12
pretty much even over civility although

932.8 --> 936.0
yeah it's just counterproductive to go

935.12 --> 939.519
overboard

936.0 --> 941.839
with with yeah uncivil behavior as it

939.519 --> 941.839
were

942.16 --> 946.56
but then again i have to survive somehow

944.56 --> 949.3599999999999
and like

946.56 --> 949.3599999999999
lies just

949.839 --> 953.519
you know when somebody makes a mistake

951.839 --> 955.759
that that

953.519 --> 958.9590000000001
that doesn't really matter to me like

955.759 --> 962.9590000000001
yeah it can be a little annoying

958.959 --> 966.0
but that's nothing like when people

962.959 --> 969.8389999999999
basically lie and then they cover

966.0 --> 973.199
for their lie by kind of pretending

969.839 --> 976.8800000000001
like they didn't know even though

973.199 --> 979.3599999999999
they by all standards should know

976.88 --> 980.16
because they've been over exposed to the

979.36 --> 983.279
details

980.16 --> 983.68
so many times and then it just becomes a

983.279 --> 987.4399999999999
lie

983.68 --> 990.079
a lie in first hand to themselves

987.44 --> 990.8000000000001
and that's something that just i can

990.079 --> 992.88
feel it

990.8 --> 994.3199999999999
you know other people could reason

992.88 --> 996.959
around it and then

994.32 --> 997.6
eventually deduce their lying i can feel

996.959 --> 1000.3199999999999
it

997.6 --> 1000.32
and it hurts

1002.8 --> 1011.68
it's i it's i take it personal

1008.32 --> 1012.8000000000001
almost like it's me that's doing that in

1011.68 --> 1016.399
in the other person

1012.8 --> 1018.16
it's it's it it springs from empathy i

1016.399 --> 1020.959
guess

1018.16 --> 1021.4399999999999
and it is part of my sensitivity you

1020.959 --> 1023.5999999999999
know

1021.44 --> 1025.1200000000001
when you sense something in somebody

1023.6 --> 1027.6
else

1025.12 --> 1028.2399999999998
your spirit's very close to that it's

1027.6 --> 1030.6399999999999
not just

1028.24 --> 1032.16
like a radar and you scan something in

1030.64 --> 1035.1200000000001
the difference no no

1032.16 --> 1035.439
when you feel something in somebody else

1035.12 --> 1039.28
you

1035.439 --> 1042.88
feel it from their perspective

1039.28 --> 1044.799
so you kind of unify with it by accident

1042.88 --> 1048.16
it's inevitable

1044.799 --> 1050.799
and that's just very straining

1048.16 --> 1052.0
but yeah the way that i live the way

1050.799 --> 1054.8799999999999
that i learned to do

1052.0 --> 1056.799
things i just standardized doing that

1054.88 --> 1061.1200000000001
it's a part of

1056.799 --> 1063.44
my going around my socializing even

1061.12 --> 1065.36
and that just becomes very very

1063.44 --> 1067.679
burdensome when i'm constantly

1065.36 --> 1071.28
confronted with people

1067.679 --> 1074.0
that just straight faced lie

1071.28 --> 1074.96
to themselves and everybody like that in

1074.0 --> 1077.36
the open

1074.96 --> 1077.3600000000001
i can't

1079.12 --> 1085.6789999999999
yeah i don't i don't really know

1083.039 --> 1086.24
how long i could hold out like this

1085.679 --> 1090.0
without

1086.24 --> 1093.36
some really good distractions from it

1090.0 --> 1095.44
like a very straightforward

1093.36 --> 1097.12
promise not from people but from the

1095.44 --> 1100.4
situation telling me

1097.12 --> 1103.36
yeah this is going a lot better

1100.4 --> 1105.2800000000002
you're doing great kid you're building

1103.36 --> 1108.559
you're making more money

1105.28 --> 1111.6
you can get out of this box eventually

1108.559 --> 1112.96
you know because the situation like it

1111.6 --> 1115.36
presents itself

1112.96 --> 1116.72
yeah i have my friends i have people in

1115.36 --> 1118.8799999999999
the flat earth

1116.72 --> 1121.28
that i guess respect me and i really

1118.88 --> 1122.48
appreciate that and i got my platforms i

1121.28 --> 1126.08
i got some

1122.48 --> 1129.1200000000001
weight in the game haha wait

1126.08 --> 1132.48
i got some high density in the game

1129.12 --> 1136.3999999999999
and yeah that's good

1132.48 --> 1137.3600000000001
that that kind of implies a growing

1136.4 --> 1141.1200000000001
curve at least

1137.36 --> 1143.28
a growth but at the same time the rest

1141.12 --> 1147.28
of the situation

1143.28 --> 1147.28
yeah i'm getting choked by youtube

1148.4 --> 1152.48
like for real and

1155.12 --> 1161.1999999999998
yeah i i'm i'm just frustrated

1162.84 --> 1167.6789999999999
because

1164.08 --> 1170.8799999999999
realize more and more that hey if i ever

1167.679 --> 1174.0800000000002
ever want to get to any kind of angle of

1170.88 --> 1178.4
getting kids at least in the netherlands

1174.08 --> 1181.36
i'm gonna have to have above

1178.4 --> 1183.44
above social welfare income i must it's

1181.36 --> 1187.6
impossible

1183.44 --> 1191.679
to do it any other way without literally

1187.6 --> 1194.3999999999999
giving your kid over to the state

1191.679 --> 1194.4
eventually

1195.039 --> 1203.2
because yeah the dependency just

1198.64 --> 1205.44
makes them pull your kid away from you

1203.2 --> 1206.559
you know only complete independence and

1205.44 --> 1208.48
that's just

1206.559 --> 1210.32
almost impossible here unless you got

1208.48 --> 1213.2
some serious income

1210.32 --> 1213.6
only complete independence prevents all

1213.2 --> 1216.0800000000002
that

1213.6 --> 1218.799
[ __ ] from just pulling your kids away

1216.08 --> 1220.08
and programming them into social justice

1218.799 --> 1223.28
warriors and just like

1220.08 --> 1225.6
oh you're a boy that means you're gay

1223.28 --> 1227.28
oh you're you're a woman that means you

1225.6 --> 1229.6789999999999
hate men

1227.28 --> 1232.08
that's [ __ ] because that gets programmed

1229.679 --> 1235.44
into kids these days

1232.08 --> 1238.48
not not super overtly but in

1235.44 --> 1240.159
in subconscious narratives just in the

1238.48 --> 1242.08
messages they deal with

1240.159 --> 1243.6000000000001
and hey if they're unlucky then even

1242.08 --> 1246.799
some some actual

1243.6 --> 1250.32
people teachers that are just

1246.799 --> 1254.32
secretly telling them this [ __ ]

1250.32 --> 1258.8799999999999
right and yeah that's specifically

1254.32 --> 1262.1589999999999
i guess here i've seen it

1258.88 --> 1263.919
just you see it you see it on people and

1262.159 --> 1264.24
yeah there's still plenty of people out

1263.919 --> 1265.919
there

1264.24 --> 1269.84
that have kids that really know what

1265.919 --> 1269.8400000000001
they're doing and that's because

1270.48 --> 1274.0
they just got logos with them in a

1272.64 --> 1276.96
certain way

1274.0 --> 1278.48
even from within naive naive position

1276.96 --> 1290.64
they just

1278.48 --> 1293.84
i don't know they did better than i did

1290.64 --> 1294.64
anyway uh yeah thanks nathan oakley 1980

1293.84 --> 1297.1999999999998
in chat

1294.64 --> 1297.2
good to see you

1297.919 --> 1302.1190000000001
so

1299.04 --> 1302.119
[Music]

1302.24 --> 1305.52
i'm just wondering like can i ever make

1304.4 --> 1309.44
it or is this your

1305.52 --> 1312.0
idea that that i'm at some point

1309.44 --> 1312.72
ever going to have like a wife and kids

1312.0 --> 1316.84
and not

1312.72 --> 1318.96
lose it all to the state something like

1316.84 --> 1322.24
that

1318.96 --> 1324.32
is that even an option for me i don't

1322.24 --> 1326.799
know anymore

1324.32 --> 1327.52
i just know that i i gotta get out of

1326.799 --> 1330.6399999999999
this

1327.52 --> 1332.48
like really get out of this and i don't

1330.64 --> 1335.5200000000002
know how to do it

1332.48 --> 1338.96
like even the yeah i've never like run

1335.52 --> 1339.44
a real business never understood that

1338.96 --> 1342.64
like

1339.44 --> 1343.44
before i'd even get to really trying i

1342.64 --> 1348.159
would just get

1343.44 --> 1350.4
so drained so drained from energy

1348.159 --> 1352.72
like literally the breath is pulled out

1350.4 --> 1352.72
of you

1353.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
and i don't understand like how other

1355.039 --> 1361.84
people can even do that

1363.52 --> 1367.76
yeah yeah tarpon stamp that that's

1365.919 --> 1369.919
exactly what i'm talking about i don't

1367.76 --> 1373.84
understand how other people

1369.919 --> 1374.4
can do that you know get is a standard

1373.84 --> 1377.52
job

1374.4 --> 1379.679
just as an employee somewhere yeah any

1377.52 --> 1382.24
most people could do that but you will

1379.679 --> 1385.3600000000001
be subjected to

1382.24 --> 1387.44
degrading behavior somehow it always

1385.36 --> 1388.6399999999999
happens because there's always somebody

1387.44 --> 1392.0
above you

1388.64 --> 1393.3600000000001
that is gonna poo-poo you or treat you

1392.0 --> 1396.64
like you're dumb

1393.36 --> 1400.0
at some point it always happens and

1396.64 --> 1402.72
people are used to that i guess

1400.0 --> 1403.44
it's like the standard [ __ ] system

1402.72 --> 1406.48
that's so

1403.44 --> 1407.52
standard that most people have become

1406.48 --> 1409.84
very good

1407.52 --> 1412.08
and kind of sort of thrive in ignoring

1409.84 --> 1413.84
it just letting that happen letting it

1412.08 --> 1418.1589999999999
slip by

1413.84 --> 1420.9599999999998
i don't really know how to do that

1418.159 --> 1423.0390000000002
no turpenstamp it's not the work

1420.96 --> 1427.8400000000001
necessarily that is degrading

1423.039 --> 1427.84
it is the people that you have to deal

1428.84 --> 1433.6789999999999
with

1430.0 --> 1433.679
they degrade you

1436.65 --> 1443.279
[Music]

1440.64 --> 1445.039
now it's not always going to be the case

1443.279 --> 1448.0
every single time you know

1445.039 --> 1449.039
if i find a really good group and it

1448.0 --> 1452.24
like it clicks

1449.039 --> 1453.279
and they get me and i get them yeah then

1452.24 --> 1456.96
it might be different

1453.279 --> 1458.64
but yeah it hasn't happened so far ever

1456.96 --> 1461.52
ever in my life and it's not like i

1458.64 --> 1461.5200000000002
never tried

1463.279 --> 1466.88
but usually i just didn't connect got

1466.559 --> 1468.96
like

1466.88 --> 1471.0390000000002
really sick of their habits and what

1468.96 --> 1474.559
they think is cool and all that

1471.039 --> 1476.72
just like really had to like hold off

1474.559 --> 1478.6399999999999
just like going at them and just like

1476.72 --> 1480.24
you're disgusting and [ __ ]

1478.64 --> 1481.76
you know what you [ __ ] you're doing

1480.24 --> 1483.76
right well if you do that yeah you

1481.76 --> 1485.12
immediately get fired but if i'd hold

1483.76 --> 1487.679
that back if i had to

1485.12 --> 1488.6399999999999
hold it in right now bite my tongue you

1487.679 --> 1492.159
know what happens

1488.64 --> 1495.44
i get depressed really quickly

1492.159 --> 1497.6000000000001
and real like my entire sleep cycle

1495.44 --> 1500.24
starts to [ __ ] me up

1497.6 --> 1501.76
because i'm just extremely unhappy being

1500.24 --> 1505.44
forced to sit

1501.76 --> 1509.76
in between people that partially

1505.44 --> 1510.48
repulse me and nobody even noted notices

1509.76 --> 1513.6
this

1510.48 --> 1515.6
nobody even notices at that point what

1513.6 --> 1517.52
repulses me anymore

1515.6 --> 1518.799
and if i'd come out for it it would make

1517.52 --> 1520.8799999999999
no sense

1518.799 --> 1523.52
to them it'll be like what are you

1520.88 --> 1529.8400000000001
whining about it

1523.52 --> 1529.84
everybody does that

1535.52 --> 1542.4
yeah that's very nice f-tappy yeah that

1539.12 --> 1544.0
that exactly exactly what you're

1542.4 --> 1544.64
describing in dutch right now in the

1544.0 --> 1548.0
chat is

1544.64 --> 1549.919
exactly where that happens

1548.0 --> 1552.48
where you actually get treated like a

1549.919 --> 1552.48
[ __ ]

1553.039 --> 1559.36
now the thing is i am extremely

1556.159 --> 1563.279
competent i am i can do

1559.36 --> 1563.279
a lot of things a lot

1564.799 --> 1569.52
when it comes at least the technical and

1567.279 --> 1571.039
mechanical things i'm an extremely quick

1569.52 --> 1575.84
learner like i could just

1571.039 --> 1580.48
walk a lot like the

1575.84 --> 1583.6
how do you call that the old-fashioned

1580.48 --> 1586.88
teacher pupil system like the

1583.6 --> 1590.1589999999999
the old system just one student i

1586.88 --> 1590.7990000000002
i thrive in that i learn extremely quick

1590.159 --> 1594.5590000000002
i can just

1590.799 --> 1598.0
copy people eventually

1594.559 --> 1600.72
and i even usually when i like what i'm

1598.0 --> 1602.0
copying i know how to ask the right

1600.72 --> 1604.24
questions that

1602.0 --> 1605.679
the teacher probably wouldn't even bring

1604.24 --> 1608.159
up

1605.679 --> 1610.159
because it works really well i learn

1608.159 --> 1613.44
extremely quickly

1610.159 --> 1616.5590000000002
and am good at what i learn

1613.44 --> 1619.279
but yeah that just doesn't happen

1616.559 --> 1620.72
and if you want some oh job guarantee

1619.279 --> 1622.32
yeah they're not going to fire you

1620.72 --> 1625.52
because you're awkward that means you're

1622.32 --> 1629.279
going to be treated like a [ __ ]

1625.52 --> 1631.279
or people are gonna hold back like oh

1629.279 --> 1634.4
i can't show him that i actually think

1631.279 --> 1637.12
he's a [ __ ] so i'm going to be

1634.4 --> 1638.8400000000001
act like he's normal yeah like i don't

1637.12 --> 1641.84
notice that

1638.84 --> 1641.84
right

1642.159 --> 1644.96
see the issue

1645.76 --> 1650.32
look there's people out here that really

1648.96 --> 1654.72
are kind of retards

1650.32 --> 1658.1589999999999
they may be like adhd people

1654.72 --> 1659.84
that have drug issues alcoholism

1658.159 --> 1661.6000000000001
social issues where they might get

1659.84 --> 1664.0
slappy with people or like

1661.6 --> 1665.1999999999998
real that are like really problematic i

1664.0 --> 1667.6
have none of that

1665.2 --> 1669.76
no the problem with me is i have too

1667.6 --> 1673.6
much smarts

1669.76 --> 1673.6
and too much sensitivity

1674.32 --> 1679.6
and usually people that have that

1677.6 --> 1681.12
especially in their early life they

1679.6 --> 1684.399
damage themselves

1681.12 --> 1687.52
on purpose because they can't handle it

1684.399 --> 1691.4399999999998
they can't handle living among absolute

1687.52 --> 1693.44
retards and demonic fools

1691.44 --> 1694.88
so they literally start to damage

1693.44 --> 1698.3200000000002
themselves starting with

1694.88 --> 1698.3200000000002
escaping through drugs

1699.12 --> 1704.7199999999998
and usually they go very far with that

1702.159 --> 1705.919
i had the same problem but i kind of

1704.72 --> 1708.0
held back because

1705.919 --> 1710.159
i kind of felt like i have something

1708.0 --> 1712.88
important to do in the future

1710.159 --> 1713.679
that's uniquely suited for my skills and

1712.88 --> 1715.3600000000001
that's this

1713.679 --> 1717.2
that's this that's a flat earth debate

1715.36 --> 1719.36
that flat earth early bird that's my

1717.2 --> 1723.039
scientific

1719.36 --> 1725.12
discoveries the cosmogeny modeling that

1723.039 --> 1725.52
i do those are two separate things by

1725.12 --> 1728.6399999999999
the way

1725.52 --> 1732.1589999999999
just for the record and oh

1728.64 --> 1732.159
by the way my chat is not

1732.559 --> 1739.84
working for some reason that is weird

1734.799 --> 1739.84
hold on

1753.919 --> 1759.279
i thought i fine-tuned it hello

1761.12 --> 1763.6789999999999
what the

1765.2 --> 1768.24
why isn't it working

1774.24 --> 1779.919
what the hell okay

1777.44 --> 1784.0800000000002
for some reason that the chat box isn't

1779.919 --> 1784.0800000000002
working anymore i have no idea why

1785.36 --> 1788.4299999999998
[Music]

1792.559 --> 1796.24
this is very odd okay there's no

1794.88 --> 1799.279
functioning chat

1796.24 --> 1802.159
in the early bird recording

1799.279 --> 1802.159
for some reason

1805.84 --> 1812.0
it's not working as usual adam meekin

1809.44 --> 1822.24
if you could contact me over skype i

1812.0 --> 1826.08
could use some help with that

1822.24 --> 1826.08
but yeah not during a live show anyway

1829.52 --> 1837.84
looks like it is

1841.12 --> 1849.1999999999998
yeah work is not a social club

1844.48 --> 1850.3990000000001
sure all right so yeah that's very nice

1849.2 --> 1852.88
so i

1850.399 --> 1854.6399999999999
it's just going to be slavery then i'm

1852.88 --> 1858.64
just going to have to allow

1854.64 --> 1861.8400000000001
myself to get desensitized and degraded

1858.64 --> 1864.159
just to get by right

1861.84 --> 1865.519
because you actually have to thrive at

1864.159 --> 1868.24
your work

1865.519 --> 1870.64
to get more money to grow out of a

1868.24 --> 1874.32
situation right

1870.64 --> 1877.8400000000001
it's working no it's not working

1874.32 --> 1879.6
do you see text here on the left side of

1877.84 --> 1882.32
the screen under the flat earth early

1879.6 --> 1886.0
bird logos do you see text there or what

1882.32 --> 1893.84
i don't well it's not working

1886.0 --> 1893.84
and i can't explain why

1907.6 --> 1910.7199999999998
very weird

1919.6 --> 1922.559
let me try this

1923.2 --> 1928.48
maybe this will work

1926.24 --> 1934.3990000000001
because yeah my firefox browser crashed

1928.48 --> 1937.6
at some point as well

1934.399 --> 1948.799
nope nope the chat

1937.6 --> 1951.279
is gone goody

1948.799 --> 1951.279
anyway

1956.159 --> 1962.3200000000002
so yeah i'm pretty sure again

1960.32 --> 1964.08
again and this is like the conundrum

1962.32 --> 1965.76
that all the trolls are trying to push

1964.08 --> 1967.4399999999998
me for i guess

1965.76 --> 1969.039
that if i want to get out of this

1967.44 --> 1971.679
situation i'm going to have to

1969.039 --> 1974.48
completely break off the scene

1971.679 --> 1978.96
which will be a huge cut also in my

1974.48 --> 1981.76
social life because i'm not gonna handle

1978.96 --> 1983.039
dealing with freaking ballers and at the

1981.76 --> 1986.48
same time

1983.039 --> 1989.2
like get a life and a job out there and

1986.48 --> 1990.64
and like really work at it it's not

1989.2 --> 1994.48
gonna happen

1990.64 --> 1998.24
explained this before so yeah

1994.48 --> 2000.96
are they winning because youtube's still

1998.24 --> 2000.96
choking me

2002.84 --> 2007.6789999999999
right

2004.48 --> 2010.88
doesn't seem like i'm growing here

2007.679 --> 2014.64
do you have you guys realize that it's

2010.88 --> 2019.1200000000001
it's now again over two months

2014.64 --> 2021.679
over two months since i got stuck

2019.12 --> 2024.1589999999999
seventeen hundred and sixty subscribers

2021.679 --> 2027.2
again yeah i even forgot about that one

2024.159 --> 2029.1200000000001
you know it's not just choking my views

2027.2 --> 2030.32
or my views i don't know if my views are

2029.12 --> 2032.799
choked

2030.32 --> 2033.6
at least the votes are severely choked

2032.799 --> 2036.8799999999999
but yeah

2033.6 --> 2041.6789999999999
even my subscribers they're stuck

2036.88 --> 2043.8400000000001
to 70 60 for over two months again

2041.679 --> 2045.039
after like a short growth of like what

2043.84 --> 2047.84
is it again

2045.039 --> 2050.159
40 people like in the time span of a

2047.84 --> 2050.159
week

2050.32 --> 2054.32
and then it's just like no no you're

2053.44 --> 2061.839
stuck it's

2054.32 --> 2061.839
70 60. it's just freaking great

2072.159 --> 2076.56
ballers are everywhere you won't escape

2074.159 --> 2079.599
them yeah that's right

2076.56 --> 2080.96
that's why i'm not in a hurry to

2079.599 --> 2084.159
basically drop this

2080.96 --> 2084.159
and then get out there

2084.32 --> 2091.52
right and try and really

2087.359 --> 2094.0789999999997
get a position somewhere with a job

2091.52 --> 2094.879
because hey if if ballers have to

2094.079 --> 2099.599
freaking

2094.879 --> 2101.359
go to confront me face to face

2099.599 --> 2102.7200000000003
about that i'm a flat earther and that

2101.359 --> 2104.3199999999997
they're going to make sure i'm they're

2102.72 --> 2107.4399999999996
going to lose their job i will

2104.32 --> 2111.52
lose my job because i will

2107.44 --> 2114.8
literally bash their faces in

2111.52 --> 2115.7599999999998
you know i will because i'm that sick of

2114.8 --> 2119.52
it

2115.76 --> 2121.8390000000004
i'm so sick of those types of people

2119.52 --> 2122.56
and yeah they troll me here on the

2121.839 --> 2124.56
internet

2122.56 --> 2127.44
but i know they're out there in the real

2124.56 --> 2130.32
world they just look like normal people

2127.44 --> 2132.32
until the demon comes out until they see

2130.32 --> 2135.44
something that they think is out of

2132.32 --> 2139.2000000000003
order of the commandment of

2135.44 --> 2142.2400000000002
the one eye freaking satan that tells

2139.2 --> 2143.52
this you cannot let that happen because

2142.24 --> 2146.3999999999996
it hurts

2143.52 --> 2147.2
so you gotta bully them put them in

2146.4 --> 2149.76
their place

2147.2 --> 2153.2799999999997
show who has the power yeah i can't deal

2149.76 --> 2153.28
with that anymore those people

2154.64 --> 2158.8799999999997
yeah that's right neon boots and it will

2157.599 --> 2161.839
get another people's

2158.88 --> 2164.079
another person's face bashed in if they

2161.839 --> 2167.04
pull that [ __ ] on me

2164.079 --> 2169.04
you know if they're just like dude don't

2167.04 --> 2170.8
don't think you're like all that you

2169.04 --> 2173.2
know you're the newcomer

2170.8 --> 2175.04
know your place i'd be like yes sir

2173.2 --> 2179.1189999999997
you're completely right

2175.04 --> 2181.44
i agree literally no problem at all

2179.119 --> 2184.4
but if they're gonna be like you're a

2181.44 --> 2188.2400000000002
stupid flat earther i'm gonna make sure

2184.4 --> 2191.92
that yeah you're gonna get kicked out

2188.24 --> 2195.52
i am going to assault them

2191.92 --> 2195.52
they won't see it coming

2199.599 --> 2204.8
i don't care who it is i don't care who

2202.8 --> 2207.04
they think they are i don't care

2204.8 --> 2209.04
what they're gonna do i will [ __ ]

2207.04 --> 2211.52
assault them

2209.04 --> 2215.839
because i'm so fed up with this [ __ ] i

2211.52 --> 2215.839
have been for a very long time

2218.98 --> 2222.099
[Music]

2225.28 --> 2229.0400000000004
i'm not gonna mention flat earth at work

2227.839 --> 2232.88
i don't even mention

2229.04 --> 2235.599
flat earth out there i don't

2232.88 --> 2235.599
i never do

2236.079 --> 2239.2000000000003
what you think i'm like do you do you

2238.64 --> 2242.8799999999997
think i

2239.2 --> 2245.359
like being confronted with baller

2242.88 --> 2248.48
behavior all day long

2245.359 --> 2250.16
i don't you know on the internet i can

2248.48 --> 2252.079
seek it out because i know where they're

2250.16 --> 2254.64
at and then i can

2252.079 --> 2256.4
get in the mood and maul them and then

2254.64 --> 2257.92
step away when i'm done with that [ __ ]

2256.4 --> 2260.2400000000002
in the physical world it

2257.92 --> 2262.8
it doesn't really work like that so i'm

2260.24 --> 2264.64
not gonna spread around

2262.8 --> 2267.119
that i'm just going to be talking about

2264.64 --> 2270.64
flat earth like everywhere

2267.119 --> 2273.52
in the open because yeah

2270.64 --> 2275.04
then i'll get buried under freaking

2273.52 --> 2278.24
sociopath

2275.04 --> 2280.32
program drone maniacs and the

2278.24 --> 2282.9599999999996
netherlands is freaking full of them

2280.32 --> 2283.599
especially the ones that have money

2282.96 --> 2288.079
they're all

2283.599 --> 2288.079
a bunch of control freak liars

2288.56 --> 2292.88
you don't and they don't even remember

2290.4 --> 2295.76
that they are until they're confronted

2292.88 --> 2299.839
with the deeper ingrained lies

2295.76 --> 2299.8390000000004
that they've let slid in slip in

2306.0 --> 2310.8
then you should be totally fine oh

2308.4 --> 2310.8
really

2311.28 --> 2316.88
so what about if people ask me what i do

2314.8 --> 2319.76
and then i say yeah i used to have a

2316.88 --> 2319.76
youtube show

2320.079 --> 2323.599
and there they demand they ask me you

2323.2 --> 2326.0789999999997
know

2323.599 --> 2327.28
maybe they're even going to like act

2326.079 --> 2329.28
like they're halfway

2327.28 --> 2330.8
nice and open about things and then i

2329.28 --> 2332.6400000000003
just tell them yeah i talk about

2330.8 --> 2334.1600000000003
controversial things like flat earth and

2332.64 --> 2337.52
then they're like ah

2334.16 --> 2338.72
oh no you didn't now i'm going to switch

2337.52 --> 2343.2
around my face

2338.72 --> 2344.8799999999997
and i'm going to bully you now right

2343.2 --> 2355.839
because there's people like there too

2344.88 --> 2355.839
like that too out here

2356.72 --> 2364.0789999999997
then they laugh at me i've never

2360.72 --> 2369.839
been laughed at like that

2364.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
public usually people don't do that

2371.76 --> 2377.599
you know i i do have a slightly

2375.28 --> 2379.8390000000004
intimidating look on me

2377.599 --> 2381.04
because i don't look like a freaking

2379.839 --> 2384.56
baby man

2381.04 --> 2387.359
in his pajamas walking around the soy

2384.56 --> 2387.359
face all day

2387.44 --> 2393.119
right so most people don't

2390.8 --> 2394.7200000000003
don't [ __ ] with me because they know

2393.119 --> 2397.04
it's dangerous

2394.72 --> 2399.9199999999996
but yeah if i'm in a job there will be

2397.04 --> 2403.2799999999997
people doing exactly that

2399.92 --> 2403.28
to exert their power

2404.64 --> 2408.319
it almost always happens it's extremely

2407.44 --> 2410.4
rare

2408.319 --> 2412.56
that it doesn't happen you have to have

2410.4 --> 2415.839
like a smaller group

2412.56 --> 2418.88
like an independent company that has

2415.839 --> 2422.4
his own workers and his own ideas

2418.88 --> 2424.96
and with a brotherly feeling but yeah

2422.4 --> 2426.88
those people have their own issues with

2424.96 --> 2430.319
the outside world they're not gonna

2426.88 --> 2431.28
they don't exactly have a an open door

2430.319 --> 2434.56
policy

2431.28 --> 2439.8390000000004
especially to weirdos that don't have a

2434.56 --> 2439.839
record of yeah employment

2442.079 --> 2445.28
so anyway but yeah we'll see what

2444.319 --> 2447.52
happens you know

2445.28 --> 2449.76
at some point if this is going to just

2447.52 --> 2453.28
stay like this

2449.76 --> 2455.76
it's not going to improve then yeah

2453.28 --> 2458.079
it's just going to be bye bye and then i

2455.76 --> 2459.8390000000004
will try and who knows what will happen

2458.079 --> 2461.6800000000003
maybe nothing will happen maybe things

2459.839 --> 2463.52
will go great maybe things will grow

2461.68 --> 2465.5989999999997
great and then suddenly go wrong and i

2463.52 --> 2468.56
will bash somebody's face and then

2465.599 --> 2470.7200000000003
lose my job and end up in jail and then

2468.56 --> 2471.68
i'll probably get back like yeah guys i

2470.72 --> 2474.7999999999997
tried

2471.68 --> 2474.7999999999997
now i'm in jail

2478.56 --> 2481.92
never been to jail by the way ever i

2480.72 --> 2485.1189999999997
have zero

2481.92 --> 2488.64
criminal record zero

2485.119 --> 2488.6400000000003
zero zero zero

2490.56 --> 2495.839
yeah see if you can say the same trolls

2502.69 --> 2507.599
[Music]

2505.119 --> 2510.1600000000003
yeah that's right septeppe in jail you

2507.599 --> 2512.48
don't have to pay for house and food

2510.16 --> 2514.0789999999997
you just don't have a choice and then

2512.48 --> 2517.28
you get shoved

2514.079 --> 2518.48
very bad quality food in you for a long

2517.28 --> 2521.3590000000004
period

2518.48 --> 2522.079
so that yeah anything any health

2521.359 --> 2524.56
situation

2522.079 --> 2525.6800000000003
i've built up for myself will all be

2524.56 --> 2529.2
ripped away

2525.68 --> 2530.64
isn't that just fantastic it'll all be

2529.2 --> 2534.319
for nothing

2530.64 --> 2538.16
get out and i'll be an old wreck

2534.319 --> 2540.64
not really by the way but i will

2538.16 --> 2543.52
grow older from that [ __ ] because of the

2540.64 --> 2543.52
food quality

2549.599 --> 2554.6400000000003
no no tried that

2555.359 --> 2559.359
there there is no help for that

2560.88 --> 2565.839
look for somebody that has a temper i

2563.44 --> 2568.079
have absolute perfect control

2565.839 --> 2569.7599999999998
you realize i have a zero criminal

2568.079 --> 2572.8
record with this temper

2569.76 --> 2574.48
i've never assaulted anyone problem is

2572.8 --> 2577.599
though is that just the level of

2574.48 --> 2578.0
tension has been rising and i'm becoming

2577.599 --> 2581.76
less

2578.0 --> 2584.48
tolerant for it so i risk of that switch

2581.76 --> 2585.5200000000004
just flipping all of a sudden i risk it

2584.48 --> 2587.44
i feel it

2585.52 --> 2588.8
i almost want it to happen because i'm

2587.44 --> 2594.079
so [ __ ]

2588.8 --> 2594.079
sick of this world so sick of it

2600.4 --> 2603.839
nobody is at the door

2603.92 --> 2607.839
are you blabbering about

2646.88 --> 2649.839
all right

2651.359 --> 2654.72
work i'll do push-ups

2660.839 --> 2666.16
well

2662.16 --> 2669.92
i would normally hey vegan [ __ ]

2666.16 --> 2671.7599999999998
long time no see three years yeah

2669.92 --> 2673.839
flat earth early bird that's long isn't

2671.76 --> 2673.8390000000004
it

2674.839 --> 2680.24
it's pretty much two years now by the

2678.079 --> 2680.2400000000002
way

2684.079 --> 2687.92
yeah a good servant look with the

2685.839 --> 2691.2799999999997
push-ups and all that

2687.92 --> 2691.92
it's also just about what my body is

2691.28 --> 2695.6800000000003
like i

2691.92 --> 2698.8
i'm having a lot of issues that

2695.68 --> 2699.52
are not due to my supplementation not

2698.8 --> 2702.319
being

2699.52 --> 2703.52
good or something it's just the

2702.319 --> 2706.8
transition i

2703.52 --> 2710.319
yeah i've been having issues with this

2706.8 --> 2713.44
for some time now my jaw and it's just

2710.319 --> 2716.56
pissing me off too and it's almost like

2713.44 --> 2718.079
getting pissed off makes it worse but

2716.56 --> 2720.319
it's tough to escape from

2718.079 --> 2723.44
i don't know maybe at some point i will

2720.319 --> 2725.839
be released from this anger

2723.44 --> 2727.68
and i'll just stop and i can just let it

2725.839 --> 2730.839
go i want to let it go i

2727.68 --> 2733.52
really do i literally pray to jesus

2730.839 --> 2736.64
christ

2733.52 --> 2738.319
to please help me let it go i really

2736.64 --> 2742.4
want to let it go

2738.319 --> 2744.839
okay i really do it's just not working

2742.4 --> 2747.839
it's not going away

2744.839 --> 2747.839
okay

2751.73 --> 2754.789
[Music]

2762.75 --> 2769.3
[Music]

2772.839 --> 2775.839
ah

2779.68 --> 2785.7599999999998
right seeking star wars yeah correct

2783.2 --> 2788.3999999999996
i i need to add something to that by the

2785.76 --> 2791.599
way it seems like

2788.4 --> 2795.28
i'm mixing up like

2791.599 --> 2798.6400000000003
targets like the ballers

2795.28 --> 2800.5600000000004
the really really shitty maximum liar

2798.64 --> 2803.7599999999998
ballers

2800.56 --> 2807.839
and then you have like the the brutal

2803.76 --> 2810.96
psychopath satanist controller people

2807.839 --> 2814.64
the elitists

2810.96 --> 2815.359
and i when i get very enraged i kind of

2814.64 --> 2819.44
mix it all

2815.359 --> 2822.0
into one in my feelings i tried to still

2819.44 --> 2824.7200000000003
keep them apart

2822.0 --> 2826.64
but yeah some of the anger that gets out

2824.72 --> 2828.0789999999997
that i direct towards baller seems

2826.64 --> 2831.839
overkill

2828.079 --> 2834.96
because i kind of group them in with the

2831.839 --> 2836.88
freaking disgusting murderous psychopath

2834.96 --> 2840.7200000000003
that actually do that sort of thing

2836.88 --> 2842.7200000000003
as their hobby right

2840.72 --> 2845.5989999999997
and that's a problem because they're not

2842.72 --> 2847.839
the same they're just

2845.599 --> 2850.2400000000002
like total opposites from the same

2847.839 --> 2854.319
spectrum but it's very different

2850.24 --> 2857.2
it's both drenched in sin but

2854.319 --> 2860.16
the one is completely different type of

2857.2 --> 2860.16
sin as the other

2861.359 --> 2865.839
it's even hard to put it next to one

2863.52 --> 2868.64
another and then compare it

2865.839 --> 2869.119
but it it should be obvious that like

2868.64 --> 2872.96
real

2869.119 --> 2876.2400000000002
disgusting eugenicist

2872.96 --> 2879.76
satanic murderers

2876.24 --> 2887.839
are not in the same category as

2879.76 --> 2887.8390000000004
religious fanatical delusional ballers

2887.92 --> 2892.319
but when i get very pissed off i kind of

2891.04 --> 2896.319
mix them into one

2892.319 --> 2898.319
in my outbursts so if you picked up on

2896.319 --> 2901.52
that

2898.319 --> 2904.079
yeah i'm sorry about that it's not

2901.52 --> 2904.8
i don't have perfect anger control or

2904.079 --> 2907.8390000000004
anything

2904.8 --> 2915.8390000000004
when i let it out okay i do my best

2907.839 --> 2915.839
it's not i'm not perfect at it

2925.28 --> 2930.079
yeah that's ridiculous negative

2940.839 --> 2943.839
exponents

2948.96 --> 2952.559
all right well george sanford

2954.0 --> 2959.28
hoping doesn't help wishing might help

2956.88 --> 2962.2400000000002
and praying definitely helps

2959.28 --> 2964.079
but it doesn't always work it's not like

2962.24 --> 2966.4799999999996
allopathic medicine

2964.079 --> 2967.8390000000004
it's not like oh you take this pill then

2966.48 --> 2970.4
you get

2967.839 --> 2971.52
this effect it doesn't work like that

2970.4 --> 2973.2000000000003
you see

2971.52 --> 2974.88
if you don't get that it's just because

2973.2 --> 2976.7999999999997
you're stubborn

2974.88 --> 2978.6400000000003
you don't understand that it actually

2976.8 --> 2982.8390000000004
does work it's proven

2978.64 --> 2987.2
does directly proven

2982.839 --> 2987.2
yeah but

2989.839 --> 2997.2
when it comes to yeah intentions

2993.04 --> 3000.079
and the situation the problem is also

2997.2 --> 3000.72
like i'm i feel like i'm being robbed of

3000.079 --> 3005.3590000000004
of my

3000.72 --> 3007.4399999999996
peace of mind and added energy

3005.359 --> 3008.72
like all these people out there getting

3007.44 --> 3011.76
in your face being

3008.72 --> 3015.04
absolutely disgusting they rob you

3011.76 --> 3027.119
of your energy of your peace

3015.04 --> 3030.48
they're stealing it

3027.119 --> 3030.48
what are you talking about

3032.88 --> 3040.0
and i don't want it to be stolen

3036.96 --> 3043.52
i can use it i need it

3040.0 --> 3045.599
i thrive on that piece on that energy

3043.52 --> 3046.72
i don't want them to steal it away

3045.599 --> 3049.599
anymore i want

3046.72 --> 3049.5989999999997
to stop them

3053.2 --> 3056.96
and i'm not willing to just surrender it

3056.48 --> 3061.68
all

3056.96 --> 3068.16
you get it i don't want to surrender

3061.68 --> 3073.2799999999997
the energy i want to claim it

3068.16 --> 3073.2799999999997
it's mine it came out of me

3073.76 --> 3076.8
i'm not just gonna surrender it to the

3075.52 --> 3080.079
world because the world is

3076.8 --> 3083.28
[ __ ] up and run by demons

3080.079 --> 3085.52
i refuse i don't give a [ __ ] i don't

3083.28 --> 3086.079
even give a [ __ ] if the freaking creator

3085.52 --> 3090.0
himself

3086.079 --> 3092.319
ordained it i refuse

3090.0 --> 3097.839
i'm not gonna surrender my energy to a

3092.319 --> 3097.839
bunch of freaking demons

3107.599 --> 3113.6800000000003
thank you so much ben white that's a

3110.64 --> 3115.04
really nice comment i you have no idea

3113.68 --> 3116.8799999999997
you might have an idea now that i'm

3115.04 --> 3120.0
talking about yeah

3116.88 --> 3120.0
that does a lot of good

3120.72 --> 3124.9599999999996
because i do feel often like it's only

3123.76 --> 3127.5200000000004
trolls out there and

3124.96 --> 3129.599
everybody just hates me or is jealous of

3127.52 --> 3133.599
me or just thinks

3129.599 --> 3136.7200000000003
just look at the minor things

3133.599 --> 3138.0
in me that aren't so admirable that's

3136.72 --> 3140.9599999999996
what i feel a lot of the

3138.0 --> 3142.96
time and i do kind of forget then that

3140.96 --> 3146.0
apparently there are people that do

3142.96 --> 3148.0
act yeah actually appreciate me

3146.0 --> 3150.88
i don't get a lot of constant comments

3148.0 --> 3153.04
about that either so

3150.88 --> 3154.48
although i do know just from the regular

3153.04 --> 3158.88
people in my chat

3154.48 --> 3158.88
i know that they do appreciate it

3159.28 --> 3163.44
you have a lot more supporters than you

3161.119 --> 3166.6400000000003
might think well ben white

3163.44 --> 3168.64
i wouldn't know because youtube refuses

3166.64 --> 3172.0789999999997
to

3168.64 --> 3174.0789999999997
just let it be as it is i don't even

3172.079 --> 3174.48
know how many people really watch my

3174.079 --> 3176.88
show

3174.48 --> 3177.92
live i don't even know how many actual

3176.88 --> 3181.2000000000003
views i have

3177.92 --> 3182.8
i don't even know what the real vote

3181.2 --> 3186.48
situation is

3182.8 --> 3189.6800000000003
look even right now even right now

3186.48 --> 3193.04
it says seven up votes and 35

3189.68 --> 3195.359
down yeah

3193.04 --> 3196.88
i don't really feel the appreciation as

3195.359 --> 3199.92
much

3196.88 --> 3201.4300000000003
because it's just being

3199.92 --> 3204.2400000000002
robbed away

3201.43 --> 3208.16
[Music]

3204.24 --> 3210.319
so yeah and i don't exactly expect

3208.16 --> 3211.839
all my the people that really do

3210.319 --> 3215.04
appreciate me that they're

3211.839 --> 3217.44
like gonna counter this action

3215.04 --> 3219.2799999999997
by constantly sending me supporting

3217.44 --> 3223.2000000000003
messages or something

3219.28 --> 3226.88
to kind of a balance

3223.2 --> 3226.8799999999997
against what youtube is doing

3229.119 --> 3232.88
but yeah

3235.599 --> 3243.119
but again i do thank you for the yeah

3239.04 --> 3246.0
pretty appreciative words hey brent m

3243.119 --> 3246.0
long time no see

3249.04 --> 3253.119
youtube are highly controlled by the

3250.72 --> 3256.7999999999997
elite power yes i know

3253.119 --> 3259.839
satanic anti-human control

3256.8 --> 3264.079
freaks are in control

3259.839 --> 3264.5589999999997
of of this system the youtube system and

3264.079 --> 3267.599
they

3264.559 --> 3271.0400000000004
literally leave the switches open

3267.599 --> 3271.52
for any low down goblin grabber piece of

3271.04 --> 3275.119
[ __ ]

3271.52 --> 3276.079
to take it take the reigns of any show

3275.119 --> 3278.48
any group

3276.079 --> 3280.319
and just [ __ ] around with it to destroy

3278.48 --> 3283.2
it they designed it that

3280.319 --> 3285.599
that way or kind of redesigned it it

3283.2 --> 3288.8799999999997
didn't used to be like that

3285.599 --> 3292.079
they made it they made it to be

3288.88 --> 3296.319
corrupt they redesigned the thing

3292.079 --> 3299.04
to mutate it into a corrupt monster

3296.319 --> 3301.599
it doesn't need to be like this they're

3299.04 --> 3303.839
making it like that

3301.599 --> 3304.6400000000003
and i can't believe that that's just

3303.839 --> 3306.96
allowed

3304.64 --> 3307.839
for almost like a worldwide giant

3306.96 --> 3310.64
platform

3307.839 --> 3311.2799999999997
to be just satanically corrupted like

3310.64 --> 3316.48
this

3311.28 --> 3316.48
it's so disgusting unbelievable

3318.839 --> 3322.64
like i

3323.119 --> 3328.1600000000003
i'm really hoping this yeah it sounds

3326.4 --> 3330.2400000000002
kind of silly even saying it like that

3328.16 --> 3333.359
at this point because yeah

3330.24 --> 3336.3999999999996
what is real anymore you know but

3333.359 --> 3340.5589999999997
i would really appreciate it if

3336.4 --> 3343.44
trump the trump administration just

3340.559 --> 3344.559
arrested the management of youtube for

3343.44 --> 3348.0
treachery and

3344.559 --> 3351.92
selling state-owned

3348.0 --> 3352.88
secrets to hostile foreign governments

3351.92 --> 3356.16
and all that

3352.88 --> 3359.2000000000003
just arrest them very quickly

3356.16 --> 3361.2
big swat team deployment boom boom

3359.2 --> 3362.24
get them all up just drag them out of

3361.2 --> 3364.64
their houses

3362.24 --> 3366.16
in the jail and then just freaking

3364.64 --> 3369.52
nationalize youtube

3366.16 --> 3372.3999999999996
bang take it

3369.52 --> 3374.16
and then make it a constitutional

3372.4 --> 3377.6800000000003
platform

3374.16 --> 3381.1189999999997
you know what if uh

3377.68 --> 3384.3999999999996
america can spend is it billions or

3381.119 --> 3386.48
trillions of dollars on on budgets

3384.4 --> 3388.1600000000003
then they can just damn well pay for

3386.48 --> 3391.04
youtube and at least make it a

3388.16 --> 3391.359
a good constitutional based platform

3391.04 --> 3396.48
with
