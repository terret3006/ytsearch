136.16 --> 144.07999999999998
and yeah the birds out there also seem

139.8 --> 144.08
to typically hang around in Shadows

149.7 --> 156.599
right but it looks like the

153.3 --> 159.08
the rain spell is finally starting to

156.599 --> 159.07999999999998
lift again

161.7 --> 166.07999999999998

193.14 --> 199.67999999999998
starting a little late today just like

196.92 --> 201.83999999999997
I had to calm down because I was in a

199.68 --> 203.94
chat conversation over Skype with good

201.84 --> 205.86
servant and it kind of got on my nerves

203.94 --> 209.42
hello

205.86 --> 209.42000000000002
set to calm down from that

215.159 --> 217.159

hello

220.14 --> 226.98

evening is going to be another Dutch

239.7 --> 243.67999999999998
football match soccer

254.22 --> 259.56
right anyway

257.16 --> 260.82000000000005
yeah yesterday's show was pretty damn

259.56 --> 262.74
good

260.82 --> 266.479
I watched it back

262.74 --> 266.479
and it was very satisfied

266.88 --> 272.19
huh

268.83 --> 272.19
[Music]

275.4 --> 281.96
right what else was it yeah it was what

278.4 --> 281.96
also watched a couple of movies

284.759 --> 292.28000000000003
which there's a really

287.479 --> 292.28
Hollywood movie what's the name again

296.639 --> 299.18
thank you

302.94 --> 305.419
[ __ ]

305.94 --> 313.86
I thought I watched it on

309.72 --> 316.58000000000004
on Netflix but it could be mistaken

313.86 --> 316.58000000000004
hold on

338.94 --> 344.46
no I must have watched them

342.6 --> 346.699
on Netflix damn it what's it called

344.46 --> 346.69899999999996
again

351.6 --> 355.56
it's kind of stupid when I don't know

354.0 --> 359.36
the name of it

355.56 --> 359.36
was like a drama movie

359.819 --> 364.699
oh there it is right sleepers

369.18 --> 372.74
and it's woof

375.18 --> 379.8
it was really creepy

377.819 --> 382.97900000000004
it was interesting but it was also

379.8 --> 386.12
creepy it basically was like about

382.979 --> 386.12
child abuse

387.419 --> 393.06
it was very like cult I think it's like

389.699 --> 394.8
supposed to be based on some real event

393.06 --> 400.039
sort of

394.8 --> 400.039
like early 20s mid 20th century

402.56 --> 407.46
yeah Kevin B yeah Kevin Bacon I I

405.6 --> 411.18
normally really like that actor in

407.46 --> 414.06
movies but here he was well I have to

411.18 --> 415.68
say he did a good job

414.06 --> 418.56
but yeah

415.68 --> 423.66
can't really like him for it because he

418.56 --> 423.66
was like the nasty rapist pedo so

425.039 --> 430.139
but

426.539 --> 434.3
like the way he acted it out especially

430.139 --> 434.3
like in the final scene I thought it was

434.759 --> 439.74
like he took the role very serious like

437.94 --> 443.4
in an actor way and that I did

439.74 --> 447.74
appreciate but it became kind of a

443.4 --> 447.73999999999995
Revenge story and then

448.62 --> 454.02
well it eventually ends like uh like how

451.919 --> 455.81899999999996
you would expect but the way they dealt

454.02 --> 458.52
with it with the music

455.819 --> 460.86
it did kind of creep me out because it

458.52 --> 464.15999999999997
was almost kind of glorifying Revenge

460.86 --> 467.12
even though legitimate Revenge

464.16 --> 470.09900000000005
it was very dubious the whole thing

467.12 --> 472.319
morally very dubious

470.099 --> 475.56
but in a way that did make it

472.319 --> 478.259
interesting but it is yeah it is a nasty

475.56 --> 482.22
it's about nasty stuff

478.259 --> 484.379
right anyway I saw that

482.22 --> 485.879
another movie review date no I'm just

484.379 --> 489.18
keeping it short you know I don't like

485.879 --> 492.47900000000004
to spoil movies anyway

489.18 --> 494.90000000000003
yeah sleepers

492.479 --> 498.84
creepy movie

494.9 --> 503.4
interesting but still creepy

498.84 --> 507.17999999999995
not entirely 100 moral it's it's very

503.4 --> 509.65999999999997
typical liberal 20th century

507.18 --> 509.66
anyway

514.38 --> 519.599
Infinity infinite

516.899 --> 522.62
two I don't know what that is I don't

519.599 --> 522.62
know infinite one

523.099 --> 530.399
reincarnation oh God

526.56 --> 533.04
so that's a sci-fi movie I take it

530.399 --> 534.779
you saw it in theaters oh gee she could

533.04 --> 537.12
serve me

534.779 --> 540.06
well this is a movie I wouldn't want to

537.12 --> 542.1
watch in theaters sleepers I watched it

540.06 --> 544.6199999999999
on video and that way you can turn it

542.1 --> 546.72
off and walk away yeah if you're gonna

544.62 --> 549.12
have to ride through it

546.72 --> 552.32
ugh

549.12 --> 552.32
I wouldn't want to

557.1 --> 563.3000000000001
wish Master ugh

559.44 --> 563.3000000000001
which Master is kinda lame

569.459 --> 575.0
was not impressed with that one at all

572.279 --> 575.0
uh

575.16 --> 581.24
right anyway no I didn't want to make

578.519 --> 583.74
today a movie review day

581.24 --> 585.0600000000001
although you guys seem to be bringing it

583.74 --> 588.74
up so

585.06 --> 588.7399999999999
you know I'm flexible

597.81 --> 600.9699999999999
[Music]

622.38 --> 630.86
okay well Dutch sailor can you

625.64 --> 630.86
summarize basically the postulate

630.959 --> 636.54
infinite

633.24 --> 638.7
like what is the key suggestion within

636.54 --> 642.26
reincarnation how

638.7 --> 642.26
what was the point of it

648.779 --> 653.36
how did they suggest the mechanic worked

661.86 --> 667.26
if it's too complicated and and you say

664.92 --> 669.779
that it is actually kind of good despite

667.26 --> 670.98
well the symbols that you did had this

669.779 --> 673.4399999999999
taste for

670.98 --> 676.399
I might just watch it myself if you

673.44 --> 676.399
think that's worth it

701.88 --> 708.54
you know if I may for a second

705.0 --> 710.42
slam down some esoterics

708.54 --> 714.06
like

710.42 --> 716.3389999999999
Jesus's path and his methods are very

714.06 --> 719.66
compatible

716.339 --> 719.6600000000001
with reincarnation

720.06 --> 726.18
not saying that it it suggests it I'm

723.36 --> 728.639
just saying it's mechanically compatible

726.18 --> 734.04
because the suggestion is

728.639 --> 737.1
a great afterlife right to attain heaven

734.04 --> 740.2199999999999
well if you create a better world and

737.1 --> 744.779
that Echoes on then you die

740.22 --> 747.1800000000001
and you would reincarnate in accordance

744.779 --> 750.0
like the level of your Deeds would

747.18 --> 752.16
matter to how you reincarnate then

750.0 --> 754.74
effectively it's the same thing because

752.16 --> 757.56
you created a better world in a previous

754.74 --> 759.839
life and then you now

757.56 --> 762.54
return

759.839 --> 764.4590000000001
within that better world so you

762.54 --> 768.98
literally then created a heaven for

764.459 --> 768.9799999999999
yourself huh how about that one

771.0 --> 777.0
purely esoteric right I'm not saying

774.24 --> 779.279
that it's literal I'm just saying it's

777.0 --> 781.019
mechanically compatible on an esoteric

779.279 --> 783.56
level

781.019 --> 783.5600000000001
huh

787.81 --> 790.9399999999999
[Music]

805.079 --> 809.2199999999999
the good guys need to wrap something

807.06 --> 812.899
from a past life then the memory would

809.22 --> 812.899
get a reboot okay that's weird

814.98 --> 820.0790000000001
so it's not so much about reincarnation

817.32 --> 822.0
as it is about past life or did

820.079 --> 824.0999999999999
did the movie

822.0 --> 826.5
that the camera the story basically

824.1 --> 828.779
follow literally somebody dying and

826.5 --> 831.72
reincarnating otherwise it's about past

828.779 --> 835.04
lives now don't reify that with the

831.72 --> 835.0400000000001
concept of reincarnation

835.22 --> 839.82
there is no definitive

840.66 --> 845.16
like there's no definitive relation

842.88 --> 847.68
between reincarnation and past lives

845.16 --> 851.9399999999999
there is very strong correlations though

847.68 --> 854.3389999999999
it's not definitive proof that they are

851.94 --> 856.86
because of the same thing

854.339 --> 858.48
right it can be other things past life

856.86 --> 862.279
memories

858.48 --> 862.279
there's many ways to explain that

864.12 --> 868.62
concept was funny okay

866.339 --> 871.3800000000001
so it was kind of like a spiritual

868.62 --> 874.139
science fiction with new AG

871.38 --> 876.24
I guess because past lives when it's

874.139 --> 878.639
just focusing on that and memories of

876.24 --> 879.899
that that's usually more directed at new

878.639 --> 882.54
agers

879.899 --> 885.54
they go for that

882.54 --> 888.18
you should just watch it alright

885.54 --> 891.139
I might

888.18 --> 891.1389999999999
I'll look it up

907.44 --> 912.0
oh

909.54 --> 915.56

912.0 --> 915.56
download it from Pirate Bay

915.72 --> 919.639

1577.279 --> 1582.62
videos although they're usually very

1580.58 --> 1586.039
niche

1582.62 --> 1589.76
and I'm not always in the mood for that

1586.039 --> 1592.34
but he has some very interesting

1589.76 --> 1597.22
ideas

1592.34 --> 1597.22
within the territory that he

1598.64 --> 1602.24
that he analyzes

1600.5 --> 1605.36
so yeah

1602.24 --> 1607.84
I do keep track of his what what he's

1605.36 --> 1607.84
talking about

1620.36 --> 1628.4189999999999
I'll uh link you up see

esoterically talented he really knows

1695.96 --> 1698.6200000000001
how to

1699.26 --> 1703.46
yeah Crossroad he has talent for fractal

1702.02 --> 1705.26
thinking

1703.46 --> 1707.8990000000001
and he

1705.26 --> 1710.779
knows how to recognize symbols and

1707.899 --> 1714.039
existential implications

1710.779 --> 1714.039
from different perspectives

1720.559 --> 1725.779
ends up a lot talking about symbolism in

1723.5 --> 1728.659
general that way

1725.779 --> 1729.86
all right hello Nathan r

1728.659 --> 1732.64
see you

1729.86 --> 1732.6399999999999

1766.7 --> 1769.299
huh

1780.5 --> 1784.7
right

1782.299 --> 1787.399
I wonder though you know like how would

1784.7 --> 1789.6200000000001
he do in a life situation

1787.399 --> 1791.2399999999998
because all of his videos are all

1789.62 --> 1794.6789999999999
recorded

1791.24 --> 1794.679
they're all pre-recorded

1796.1 --> 1801.08
I do everything live on the spot

1799.7 --> 1804.22
foreign

1801.08 --> 1804.22
that's what I do

1810.02 --> 1815.9189999999999
what's that

1812.659 --> 1815.919
seeking star water

1820.46 --> 1823.72
oh right

1824.779 --> 1831.34
four days ago

1827.659 --> 1831.3400000000001
I think I didn't watch that one

1833.48 --> 1837.279
right yeah by the way over here in the

1835.7 --> 1840.32
Netherlands The Mask

1837.279 --> 1843.2
Band-Aid sort of suggestion has

1840.32 --> 1846.3799999999999
officially been lifted yesterday when I

1843.2 --> 1848.679
went out nobody was wearing a mask I've

1846.38 --> 1848.679
seen

1848.72 --> 1852.44
in like hundreds of people surrounding

1851.36 --> 1856.34
me

1852.44 --> 1860.3600000000001
maybe three or four women

1856.34 --> 1863.5
and really cocky looky guys still watch

1860.36 --> 1863.5
them that's it

1863.96 --> 1868.8400000000001
nobody was wearing a mask yesterday was

1866.299 --> 1868.84
a delight

1872.36 --> 1877.279
and also funny funny really

1875.419 --> 1879.26
there's been guys

1877.279 --> 1882.2
that have been

1879.26 --> 1884.12
like almost waiting for the mask lifting

1882.2 --> 1886.3990000000001
because now there's a couple of young

1884.12 --> 1889.76
guys like even in the supermarket one

1886.399 --> 1892.76
that's now we're not wearing a mask and

1889.76 --> 1894.44
he's now like proudly showing the

1892.76 --> 1896.36
mustache that he has grown in the

1894.44 --> 1898.039
meantime and yeah he has one hell of a

1896.36 --> 1899.7199999999998
bushy mustache

1898.039 --> 1902.6589999999999
for somebody

1899.72 --> 1905.299
that's still like a late teenager but

1902.659 --> 1907.3990000000001
he's like so and I've seen girls that

1905.299 --> 1908.96
have been like bragging with their new

1907.399 --> 1911.9599999999998
piercings

1908.96 --> 1913.76
as well it's like oh look see that was

1911.96 --> 1915.679
underneath the mask so there's lots of

1913.76 --> 1918.08
people out there now using this

1915.679 --> 1918.8600000000001
situation to kind of show up like oh

1918.08 --> 1921.1399999999999
look

1918.86 --> 1923.6589999999999
this was hiding under the mask I I

1921.14 --> 1927.279
thought it's kind of funny

1923.659 --> 1927.279
that that seems to be happening

1929.72 --> 1935.72
but it like the spirits because of this

1932.539 --> 1937.8799999999999
have definitely been lifted out here a

1935.72 --> 1940.8990000000001
lot of people are just very relieved

1937.88 --> 1940.8990000000001
about this all

1941.179 --> 1943.659
right

1958.46 --> 1962.0
right

1959.539 --> 1964.34
especially like with the guy

1962.0 --> 1966.46
and showing off his mustache he was

1964.34 --> 1968.899
really like oh man look at my mustache

1966.46 --> 1971.1200000000001
and it looked pretty good on him you

1968.899 --> 1973.8799999999999
know it was really manly mustache

1971.12 --> 1975.9189999999999
it's like I haven't really like bumped

1973.88 --> 1977.3600000000001
into him in order to say dude that's a

1975.919 --> 1979.3400000000001
really awesome looking mustache I'll

1977.36 --> 1983.08
probably do that today if I see him here

1979.34 --> 1983.08
in the supermarket today

1983.48 --> 1986.019
you know

1989.6 --> 1995.9599999999998
do you have to wear a mask if you're not

1992.6 --> 1997.4599999999998
faxing it what no nobody has to wear a

1995.96 --> 2001.2
mask Nathan r

1997.46 --> 2001.2
it's all just suggestive

2005.08 --> 2009.6999999999998
all right I have a card I've had it for

2007.299 --> 2011.679
over a year got it from my dad it was

2009.7 --> 2013.179
very quick to figure that out through

2011.679 --> 2016.3600000000001
his circles

2013.179 --> 2018.46
that are very anti-mask anti-vax too for

2016.36 --> 2020.799
a long time

2018.46 --> 2022.8990000000001
if just a card a government exemption

2020.799 --> 2024.94
it's like if you show that card and they

2022.899 --> 2027.82
ask you why

2024.94 --> 2030.1000000000001
then they are literally

2027.82 --> 2032.62
like violating

2030.1 --> 2037.299
like they're not allowed to ask

2032.62 --> 2040.84
that that's the code I don't know why

2037.299 --> 2042.82
but that's how it was so it's really

2040.84 --> 2045.6399999999999
only for those that are lured into

2042.82 --> 2047.74
wearing a mask here

2045.64 --> 2049.78
although they have like burdened

2047.74 --> 2052.839
businesses basically telling them like

2049.78 --> 2055.7400000000002
you have to now mandate masks for your

2052.839 --> 2059.56
employees in the store or

2055.74 --> 2061.24
you might get a fine or you'll not

2059.56 --> 2062.56
get this or that I don't know the

2061.24 --> 2063.879
details

2062.56 --> 2066.879
right

2063.879 --> 2068.859
but nobody was literally mandated to

2066.879 --> 2072.7
wear a mask

2068.859 --> 2075.7
there was just a prefab legal exemption

2072.7 --> 2079.1389999999997
that was very well covered

2075.7 --> 2079.1389999999997
was there from the start

2088.06 --> 2093.2799999999997
right yeah but start seeking star look

2090.52 --> 2095.859
it doesn't really matter what they say I

2093.28 --> 2098.92
don't think that matters is what is

2095.859 --> 2101.74
actual what's the actual structure

2098.92 --> 2104.92
behind it

2101.74 --> 2109.06
over here most of it is just suggestive

2104.92 --> 2109.06
it's just suggestion

2110.859 --> 2113.04
foreign

2115.66 --> 2118.6189999999997
anyway

2119.859 --> 2123.7
no more masks over here I hope they keep

2122.26 --> 2125.2000000000003
it that way I think a whole bunch of

2123.7 --> 2127.5989999999997
people will be

2125.2 --> 2130.0
extra annoyed if the government starts

2127.599 --> 2131.8
whining about the delta virion or

2130.0 --> 2134.14
something because that's the obvious

2131.8 --> 2136.9
next move to roll it back in it's

2134.14 --> 2140.3799999999997
already being applied in other countries

2136.9 --> 2142.6600000000003
in England and in Australia

2140.38 --> 2145.5
and the United States they're attempting

2142.66 --> 2145.5
to insert it

2152.26 --> 2156.4
it's all [ __ ]

2155.2 --> 2158.98
all right

2156.4 --> 2160.6600000000003
it's already studies studies I don't

2158.98 --> 2161.98
know there's already articles coming out

2160.66 --> 2165.2799999999997
basically

2161.98 --> 2166.72
saying that there is evidence that

2165.28 --> 2169.7200000000003
people

2166.72 --> 2172.24
having taken the vaccine which is in a

2169.72 --> 2174.2799999999997
vaccine against coronu actually have

2172.24 --> 2176.6189999999997
three time

2174.28 --> 2180.2200000000003
three times more

2176.619 --> 2181.3
severe reactions to the supposed Delta

2180.22 --> 2182.6189999999997
variety

2181.3 --> 2184.96
right

2182.619 --> 2186.579
so if you actually took the vax this

2184.96 --> 2190.119
Delta variety is going to be more

2186.579 --> 2192.2200000000003
punishing that's literally now already

2190.119 --> 2196.079
starting to come a flood

2192.22 --> 2196.0789999999997
it just goes to show like yeah

2196.48 --> 2203.26
how do you think it was going to help no

2198.7 --> 2206.2599999999998
it's it doesn't not help it makes it

2203.26 --> 2206.26
worse

2212.73 --> 2217.749
[Music]

2220.0 --> 2223.54
no it's good servant don't even joke

2221.98 --> 2226.2400000000002
about that

2223.54 --> 2229.14
don't sarcastically say those things

2226.24 --> 2229.14
don't do that

2229.96 --> 2233.15
[Music]

2236.74 --> 2239.52
bad

2239.74 --> 2243.0
bad frequency

2248.02 --> 2253.44
you understand okay well acted

2250.599 --> 2253.44
acted then

2262.9 --> 2265.44
oh

2267.46 --> 2272.7400000000002
wondering when side effects from the v's

2270.76 --> 2273.82
will start to they're showing all the

2272.74 --> 2276.06
time

2273.82 --> 2279.42
clutch bear

2276.06 --> 2279.42
all the time

2280.24 --> 2284.2599999999998
but you're just seeing the short term

2282.339 --> 2286.06
damage

2284.26 --> 2288.48
right that's what you're seeing now the

2286.06 --> 2291.94
people in which the

2288.48 --> 2293.14
influences are catastrophic much more

2291.94 --> 2296.28
quickly

2293.14 --> 2296.2799999999997
that's what you're seeing

2302.079 --> 2306.28
oh and side effects will start to show

2304.24 --> 2308.4599999999996
in mainstream how do you mean clutch

2306.28 --> 2308.46
bear

2313.24 --> 2319.9799999999996
tree graphic oh God

2316.66 --> 2319.98
seeking star water

2321.7 --> 2326.2599999999998
I don't know

2323.8 --> 2327.52
I don't exactly even know like how we

2326.26 --> 2330.2200000000003
supposed

2327.52 --> 2333.7599999999998
genetic modification technically works

2330.22 --> 2338.3199999999997
like does it work more efficiently when

2333.76 --> 2340.96
the body is burdened or magnetized

2338.32 --> 2343.78
would that be the reason why vaccinated

2340.96 --> 2346.119
people get magnetized because the

2343.78 --> 2348.82
magnetization is part of the genetic

2346.119 --> 2351.52
modification process

2348.82 --> 2353.5
and then yeah if magnetics are involved

2351.52 --> 2357.599
then 5G

2353.5 --> 2360.7
which falls under sort of yeah

2357.599 --> 2364.6800000000003
electrics indirectly frequency things

2360.7 --> 2364.68
yeah might have an influence who knows

2374.859 --> 2383.3199999999997
the Econo clutch bear why the hell

2379.24 --> 2385.18
why would they ever acknowledge the

2383.32 --> 2387.579
vaccine which is in the vaccine is

2385.18 --> 2390.46
damaging in mainstream why would they

2387.579 --> 2394.48
ever do that

2390.46 --> 2396.88
the whole thing on rides on perpetuating

2394.48 --> 2401.76
the scam

2396.88 --> 2401.76
why would they ever admit it mainstream

2402.88 --> 2407.859
like what

2404.74 --> 2410.7599999999998
what option would that give them to

2407.859 --> 2410.7599999999998
continue with

2411.16 --> 2413.339
foreign

2428.74 --> 2435.8999999999996
okay I'm not a hundred percent sure but

2431.44 --> 2435.9
by memory 4G is much more long distance

2436.54 --> 2441.2799999999997
5G is very short distance but at

2439.3 --> 2443.319
extremely broadband

2441.28 --> 2445.5400000000004
so there's more

2443.319 --> 2447.88
short reaching

2445.54 --> 2449.319
compacted

2447.88 --> 2452.98
detail

2449.319 --> 2455.2599999999998
frequency things happening detailed

2452.98 --> 2458.04
information being conveyed but it's a

2455.26 --> 2458.0400000000004
much shorter distance

2460.599 --> 2466.7200000000003
that's what 5G the technology the

2463.68 --> 2467.56
communication technology is supposed to

2466.72 --> 2472.1189999999997
be

2467.56 --> 2475.06
right but 5G might be other things too

2472.119 --> 2477.52
5G with the phone thing might actually

2475.06 --> 2479.619
just be a freaking cover for something

2477.52 --> 2483.099
that isn't really actually revealed yet

2479.619 --> 2485.26
but still is being referenced to as 5G

2483.099 --> 2487.6600000000003
there's a lot of weirdness to this 5G

2485.26 --> 2491.2000000000003
situation

2487.66 --> 2493.66
it like when things go down According to

2491.2 --> 2495.48
some plan it might not actually have to

2493.66 --> 2499.02
do anything

2495.48 --> 2501.28
with 5G

2499.02 --> 2502.72
communication technology

2501.28 --> 2505.8390000000004
right

2502.72 --> 2508.0
that's what I'm

2505.839 --> 2512.319
that's what I've been kind of like

2508.0 --> 2514.92
feeling about it and hearing things

2512.319 --> 2514.92
so

2521.319 --> 2527.64
weapon eyesight well no seeking stuff 5G

2523.96 --> 2527.64
is not weaponized by default

2527.92 --> 2536.2000000000003
it's just the system but yes it has been

2531.24 --> 2539.02
also technologically fabricated into

2536.2 --> 2541.1189999999997
being used in a weaponized fashion that

2539.02 --> 2543.9
is already officially established that

2541.119 --> 2543.9
that exists

2544.9 --> 2549.359
being used by spy agencies even

2563.14 --> 2567.18
if it's sterilized any one of them

2567.28 --> 2572.7400000000002
well look clutch bear the whole idea

2570.339 --> 2575.0789999999997
that the Vex which is in the vaccine

2572.74 --> 2577.74
will sterilize you

2575.079 --> 2582.2200000000003
yeah the thing is

2577.74 --> 2585.16
mainstream would be able to admit that

2582.22 --> 2587.7999999999997
and then when it's placed within a

2585.16 --> 2593.16
discussion in a context that's actually

2587.8 --> 2593.1600000000003
what this is at then they would deny it

2594.52 --> 2598.66
right

2595.54 --> 2601.96
though so they could go double speak

2598.66 --> 2604.839
on like that the vaccine might be be

2601.96 --> 2606.7
sterilizing people

2604.839 --> 2609.7599999999998
you could just say it in one case like

2606.7 --> 2612.7
yeah well it helps with overpopulation

2609.76 --> 2615.099
and against climate change and and then

2612.7 --> 2616.8999999999996
somebody will bring it up like who do

2615.099 --> 2618.819
you think you are that you can just fool

2616.9 --> 2619.9
people into sterilizing themselves and

2618.819 --> 2621.64
then they'll be like what are you

2619.9 --> 2626.02
talking about your conspiracy theories

2621.64 --> 2628.7799999999997
that nobody you can prove that right or

2626.02 --> 2630.819
what are you a racist that yeah

2628.78 --> 2634.1400000000003
that's what I predict about that

2630.819 --> 2634.14
specific detail

2635.44 --> 2641.2000000000003
right because on one hand they wanna

2637.9 --> 2643.839
kind of show this new culture of

2641.2 --> 2645.22
eugenics where it's okay to do that on

2643.839 --> 2649.74
the other hand they can't really

2645.22 --> 2649.74
officially admit it it's still illegal

2669.94 --> 2674.079
[Music]

2672.4 --> 2676.619
what are you talking about George

2674.079 --> 2676.619
Sanford

2677.02 --> 2682.42
got the placebo

2679.78 --> 2684.1600000000003
or if it people get a placebo then

2682.42 --> 2686.079
they're not gonna have any of the

2684.16 --> 2688.8999999999996
effects

2686.079 --> 2690.579
those effects cannot be induced

2688.9 --> 2693.46
psychosomatically

2690.579 --> 2695.6800000000003
they're not gonna become magnetic

2693.46 --> 2699.96
they're not gonna have like

2695.68 --> 2699.96
severe attacks on organs

2700.3 --> 2705.6400000000003
get all these mental disorder like they

2703.24 --> 2706.8999999999996
if you get a placebo then you won't get

2705.64 --> 2709.839
that

2706.9 --> 2712.78
unless in the placebo they still added

2709.839 --> 2715.54
Mercury or something you know no just no

2712.78 --> 2717.3390000000004
genetic modification crap that all

2715.54 --> 2719.88
depends on what kind of placebo you're

2717.339 --> 2719.88
going to be getting

2731.8 --> 2736.599
what percentage of the world population

2733.839 --> 2738.5789999999997
the controllers want to eventually kill

2736.599 --> 2742.5
just

2738.579 --> 2742.5
as much as many as they can get

2742.839 --> 2748.0
Annie will do steamy Traveler

2745.599 --> 2751.619
Annie

2748.0 --> 2751.619
they'll take it all if they could

2757.78 --> 2763.7200000000003
like all these people that are in for

2760.18 --> 2766.4199999999996
that they become completely Spellbound

2763.72 --> 2770.74
by ariman by death they become

2766.42 --> 2773.339
Spellbound they become obsessed with it

2770.74 --> 2773.339
right

2776.26 --> 2781.0600000000004
and when you get to that point

2778.599 --> 2782.7400000000002
spiritually it doesn't matter anymore it

2781.06 --> 2784.7799999999997
doesn't matter anymore if it kills

2782.74 --> 2789.9399999999996
everybody

2784.78 --> 2793.0
you just want to help the world

2789.94 --> 2794.5
by killing off all humans

2793.0 --> 2796.96
right

2794.5 --> 2800.88
then you lose your sense even for your

2796.96 --> 2800.88
own individual existence and

2802.24 --> 2807.4599999999996
yeah then it doesn't matter anymore

2805.66 --> 2810.5789999999997
how many die

2807.46 --> 2813.099
just all of them

2810.579 --> 2816.04
it's insane that's yeah that's the spell

2813.099 --> 2819.52
the getting Spellbound

2816.04 --> 2821.5
by the myth of overpopulation causing

2819.52 --> 2823.72
the total Destruction of the entire

2821.5 --> 2827.38
Realm

2823.72 --> 2829.72
not trusting that God has

2827.38 --> 2833.56
a lot of things

2829.72 --> 2835.8999999999996
hidden within the fabric of reality to

2833.56 --> 2838.14
deal with that

2835.9 --> 2838.14
foreign

2843.099 --> 2849.579
well AGM look Eugenics right the problem

2847.18 --> 2853.4199999999996
is eugenics

2849.579 --> 2856.54
has become totally [ __ ]

2853.42 --> 2859.119
it's been used it's being used as like a

2856.54 --> 2862.48
death cult now and that the original

2859.119 --> 2866.26
idea of eugenics was simply

2862.48 --> 2868.3
to have some to use social engineering

2866.26 --> 2871.96
for practical

2868.3 --> 2874.599
control and population stabilization and

2871.96 --> 2877.3
it's all about tactics with it that's

2874.599 --> 2879.6400000000003
what's what Eugenics is really all about

2877.3 --> 2882.6400000000003
it's about

2879.64 --> 2885.8799999999997
how to change the necessity of making

2882.64 --> 2889.0589999999997
really difficult decision in leadership

2885.88 --> 2892.059
how to bend it to long-term benefit that

2889.059 --> 2894.76
was really the original essence

2892.059 --> 2898.3190000000004
of the idea and then they just turn it

2894.76 --> 2898.3190000000004
into a giant death cult

2900.22 --> 2903.5989999999997
utterly corrupted

2907.14 --> 2913.2999999999997
selective reading

2910.42 --> 2915.16
now but the selective breeding is that's

2913.3 --> 2916.9
more darwinian

2915.16 --> 2917.98
thinking

2916.9 --> 2920.98
right

2917.98 --> 2920.98
eugenics

2921.94 --> 2928.059
just recognizes or originally not

2924.22 --> 2932.4399999999996
talking about the superioris idea

2928.059 --> 2936.579
is that yeah every population group

2932.44 --> 2939.52
if we race every region has their own

2936.579 --> 2941.6800000000003
unique set of talents and their Spirits

2939.52 --> 2943.54
are attuned because of it and that's why

2941.68 --> 2946.66
they function on a higher level show

2943.54 --> 2948.7
unique traits within that spectrum of

2946.66 --> 2951.16
their genetics and their Heritage

2948.7 --> 2953.0789999999997
spiritually right and if you then start

2951.16 --> 2957.22
cross-breeding everything

2953.079 --> 2958.599
then the likelihood of details of the

2957.22 --> 2961.66
Legacy and the spiritual connection

2958.599 --> 2965.619
become lost because the genes are no

2961.66 --> 2967.42
longer synchronized up as much right

2965.619 --> 2969.52
so yeah

2967.42 --> 2973.78
race mixing

2969.52 --> 2977.14
not so good for Peak qualities

2973.78 --> 2979.96
that's it not saying there is I am a

2977.14 --> 2982.0
freaking race mix okay so but I feel

2979.96 --> 2983.859
like I'm more of the exception to then

2982.0 --> 2986.079
yeah

2983.859 --> 2989.859
then the rule

2986.079 --> 2992.38
so that's woven into it but again it's

2989.859 --> 2994.54
all been so exaggerated and it's now

2992.38 --> 2996.46
just it's now just a death call like

2994.54 --> 2998.319
it's just

2996.46 --> 3001.319
right

2998.319 --> 3005.52
so yeah how could I ever know at this

3001.319 --> 3009.119
point just start defending Eugenics when

3005.52 --> 3011.46
so much ugly has been

3009.119 --> 3014.52
built upon it

3011.46 --> 3018.119
since it started

3014.52 --> 3021.18
I can't really I could just try to make

3018.119 --> 3024.38
people understand where it came from and

3021.18 --> 3024.3799999999997
how we corrupted

3034.2 --> 3037.5589999999997
right and there's a whole bunch of other

3035.94 --> 3040.88
things out there in the world that have

3037.559 --> 3040.88
suffered similar Fates

3041.76 --> 3044.7200000000003
foreign

3050.94 --> 3054.8
are you talking about AGM

3059.88 --> 3064.02
it's all about the profits we just

3062.339 --> 3067.5589999999997
collect well that's what it becomes

3064.02 --> 3070.74
about it becomes gravel so the eugenics

3067.559 --> 3073.92
became corrupted turned into how to

3070.74 --> 3076.0789999999997
program people to destroy themselves

3073.92 --> 3078.9
and then the Grapplers thought like hey

3076.079 --> 3081.48
we could freaking profit off them as

3078.9 --> 3085.339
they destroy themselves

3081.48 --> 3085.339
so that's where we're at right now

3085.8 --> 3090.7200000000003
it's just a meat grinder

3088.5 --> 3092.819
for the people

3090.72 --> 3097.16
that yeah

3092.819 --> 3097.16
that don't care about such things

3101.819 --> 3105.42
that don't care

3103.5 --> 3107.16
that they're doing that to other people

3105.42 --> 3108.3
that they're allowing other people to

3107.16 --> 3110.22
program selves to become

3108.3 --> 3112.559
self-destructive

3110.22 --> 3116.0
like that and not just towards

3112.559 --> 3116.0
themselves but towards others

3122.72 --> 3129.319
countries all right but that's

3126.3 --> 3129.319
different though

3160.46 --> 3165.18
controllers have no control if everybody

3162.72 --> 3167.7
is dead

3165.18 --> 3171.5989999999997
well

3167.7 --> 3172.9199999999996
if they all died simultaneously yes the

3171.599 --> 3175.7400000000002
thing is

3172.92 --> 3177.78
it's it's like a meat grinder engine and

3175.74 --> 3181.3799999999997
there's a long line of people and

3177.78 --> 3183.5400000000004
everybody to them is on that conveyor

3181.38 --> 3185.04
belt to the meat grinder right so yeah

3183.54 --> 3187.14
eventually yeah if there's no more

3185.04 --> 3191.119
people yeah it's all gonna end right but

3187.14 --> 3191.1189999999997
that's gonna take a whole lot of time

3191.28 --> 3195.6800000000003
so they don't worry about that they

3193.98 --> 3198.119
don't think about it they're just

3195.68 --> 3202.22
interested in getting the profits from

3198.119 --> 3202.2200000000003
the meat grinder for as long as it goes

3208.319 --> 3215.989
hey Gary ubenga good to see you

3212.68 --> 3215.989
[Music]

3220.1 --> 3223.6189999999997
[Music]

3243.9 --> 3246.559
hmm

3265.619 --> 3267.8
foreign

3289.68 --> 3294.48
well it's arranged like a giant pyramid

3292.079 --> 3296.8390000000004
screen so the real effect the key

3294.48 --> 3300.44
controllers are very few

3296.839 --> 3300.44
very very few

3303.119 --> 3307.619
most are just part of the control

3305.64 --> 3311.5989999999997
they're not really in control they're

3307.619 --> 3311.599
just part of the the Pyramid of control

3313.619 --> 3319.2000000000003
and people inside of that pyramid of

3316.319 --> 3321.98
control often don't even know who is

3319.2 --> 3324.7799999999997
there in control of the one in control

3321.98 --> 3327.38
that controls them

3324.78 --> 3327.38
huh

3337.44 --> 3339.619
foreign

3352.12 --> 3355.199
[Music]

3358.859 --> 3365.48
how

3361.319 --> 3365.48
unless they get pregnant I don't get it

3372.359 --> 3376.74
will the top of the pyramid ever be

3374.22 --> 3379.859
revealed

3376.74 --> 3382.3999999999996
yes but when it will it will be quickly

3379.859 --> 3382.4
forgotten

3388.799 --> 3393.0
in in effect it has already been

3391.619 --> 3397.819
revealed

3393.0 --> 3397.819
it just kind of snow got snowed under

3397.859 --> 3404.819
the theatrics and the players that are

3402.0 --> 3406.02
moved forward as supposedly being the

3404.819 --> 3408.66
front men

3406.02 --> 3411.119
right the actors they're the ones that

3408.66 --> 3412.0789999999997
are there to take the hit to take the

3411.119 --> 3415.5
attention

3412.079 --> 3417.7200000000003
and they you know the real controllers

3415.5 --> 3420.319
can be revealed and then it just gets

3417.72 --> 3420.319
snowed under

3422.4 --> 3425.7200000000003
it's already been revealed

3427.14 --> 3430.94
and some people do remember

3432.599 --> 3437.7000000000003
but yeah whoever's placed on some kind

3435.059 --> 3440.94
of a pedestal in Media

3437.7 --> 3442.22
will be pointed at as a the ultimate

3440.94 --> 3445.079
controller

3442.22 --> 3447.0
distracting away from those that have

3445.079 --> 3450.48
already been revealed but less

3447.0 --> 3454.02
interesting more convoluted more complex

3450.48 --> 3457.02
of who is very probable to be actually

3454.02 --> 3461.299
in control of the situation

3457.02 --> 3461.299
those people are never interesting

3465.66 --> 3469.0989999999997
and they're very secretive

3469.64 --> 3473.9
secretive is not really interesting

3477.9 --> 3482.299
who do I remember was being revealed

3509.099 --> 3514.619
how would I set it up

3511.68 --> 3518.16
okay uh

3514.619 --> 3519.599
one's in control or effectively

3518.16 --> 3521.3999999999996
top

3519.599 --> 3523.8590000000004
bankers

3521.4 --> 3526.319
but like

3523.859 --> 3530.96
hidden in the shadow like the connection

3526.319 --> 3530.96
man that really make things happen

3531.299 --> 3535.5
right

3533.52 --> 3538.559
not the ones that have the biggest pile

3535.5 --> 3542.64
of cash publicly

3538.559 --> 3544.8590000000004
and then the ultimate control lies with

3542.64 --> 3548.22
who they

3544.859 --> 3551.24
trust for personal reasons so it's

3548.22 --> 3555.24
eventually the true control will be

3551.24 --> 3555.24
Outsiders influencing

3555.42 --> 3560.7200000000003
the actual people that that have the

3558.48 --> 3560.72
power

3565.02 --> 3570.839
because yeah everybody that has power is

3567.54 --> 3573.359
just surrendered to the mechanics of the

3570.839 --> 3576.24
what comes with the power

3573.359 --> 3578.819
and they just seek a way out with

3576.24 --> 3582.9599999999996
everything they got

3578.819 --> 3586.799
but because they're so bound to just

3582.96 --> 3588.599
thinking how to maintain it all

3586.799 --> 3592.44
they need others

3588.599 --> 3594.7400000000002
to inspire them to actually find a way

3592.44 --> 3594.7400000000002
through

3601.02 --> 3605.72
so no I don't remember who was revealed

3627.9 --> 3630.319
right

3630.42 --> 3635.64
I don't even know necessarily if no if

3633.599 --> 3638.52
there is a little centralized control

3635.64 --> 3641.64
that one person would be staring at all

3638.52 --> 3644.28
I'd rather think it's just the method

3641.64 --> 3646.92
and the agreement upon using those

3644.28 --> 3650.8190000000004
method and then relying on each other

3646.92 --> 3653.4
using that method that is the control

3650.819 --> 3656.46
so I think that the methods are more in

3653.4 --> 3658.7400000000002
control than the actual people

3656.46 --> 3662.04
because when they step outside of the

3658.74 --> 3663.8999999999996
methods they violate it yeah guess what

3662.04 --> 3666.5589999999997
happens they disappear and they're

3663.9 --> 3666.559
replaced

3667.02 --> 3671.04
so is it the people

3668.88 --> 3673.579
that are in control or is it those

3671.04 --> 3673.579
methods

3677.579 --> 3683.299
Clues do you think that Bill Gates and

3680.4 --> 3683.299
Jeff Bezos

3688.02 --> 3692.059
well I'm sure they have an influence

3697.44 --> 3703.799
right and their power

3700.68 --> 3705.3799999999997
which they flaunt publicly does have

3703.799 --> 3710.819
weight

3705.38 --> 3713.2200000000003
in how things are decided to proceed

3710.819 --> 3716.22
how

3713.22 --> 3719.22
not that it proceeds

3716.22 --> 3721.4399999999996
all right so

3719.22 --> 3723.18
are they just puppets

3721.44 --> 3725.78
well there are puppets to their own

3723.18 --> 3725.7799999999997
methodology

3732.48 --> 3736.92
yeah those Ultra Rich dudes are proxies

3734.88 --> 3738.96
they always are or they wouldn't be so

3736.92 --> 3742.26
public

3738.96 --> 3745.14
again that's the the one to attain the

3742.26 --> 3747.48
attention right those are the deflectors

3745.14 --> 3749.46
they're the lightning rods

3747.48 --> 3752.22
they're the ones you're supposed to be

3749.46 --> 3754.68
outraged over and start believing that

3752.22 --> 3757.7
they are in control right that's the

3754.68 --> 3757.7
function of that

3757.799 --> 3763.619
a real controller would never enter a

3761.7 --> 3765.8999999999996
public Arena

3763.619 --> 3768.059
in that fashion

3765.9 --> 3771.9
they would never present themselves as

3768.059 --> 3774.6600000000003
lightning rods unless

3771.9 --> 3776.64
they're stepping out of the shadows and

3774.66 --> 3779.0989999999997
somebody else is taking over for them

3776.64 --> 3780.66
and then they attain that role but once

3779.099 --> 3782.46
you attain that role you could never go

3780.66 --> 3784.68
back

3782.46 --> 3786.539
once you become a lightning rod for the

3784.68 --> 3789.859
public you can never go back to the

3786.539 --> 3789.8590000000004
Shadows see

3805.92 --> 3811.6800000000003
Trump a lightning rod

3808.92 --> 3813.96
yeah duh

3811.68 --> 3816.5589999999997
it's the biggest lightning rod that was

3813.96 --> 3816.559
ever created

3828.42 --> 3833.0
I don't know what you're talking about

3830.339 --> 3833.0
clutch bear

3841.44 --> 3847.28
no I did not read your comment about

3843.48 --> 3847.28
whether Balloons look for stuff

3853.619 --> 3855.7400000000002
thank you

3881.4 --> 3883.64
foreign

3906.78 --> 3913.2200000000003
have I considered

3910.319 --> 3913.22
uh

3913.38 --> 3918.42
I'm not gonna do that

3915.72 --> 3921.4199999999996
looks for Stuff dude I don't have the

3918.42 --> 3923.4
finances or really the motivation

3921.42 --> 3925.14
this point to do any of that why why

3923.4 --> 3928.76
would I

3925.14 --> 3928.7599999999998
what would I have to prove

3965.4 --> 3969.92
okay clutch bear whatever

3990.059 --> 3994.8590000000004
looks first why would I why would I need

3993.42 --> 3998.88
that data

3994.859 --> 4003.98
I already know there's that data

3998.88 --> 4007.059
why would I specifically need to do that

4003.98 --> 4007.059
I don't see the point

4007.4 --> 4011.2000000000003
determine if the Dome is Rich but

4011.539 --> 4018.1600000000003
no it's not reachable

4015.02 --> 4018.16
that could never work

4020.42 --> 4026.119
how is it gonna do that you know

4022.94 --> 4027.92
balloons just burst at some point

4026.119 --> 4030.44
what you think that you can make a

4027.92 --> 4032.7200000000003
tougher balloon and you think that it

4030.44 --> 4034.7000000000003
that it won't burst at some point like

4032.72 --> 4037.64
okay well good luck with that

4034.7 --> 4041.2
like I don't I don't see why I would be

4037.64 --> 4041.2
sending up a balloon for any reason

4044.0 --> 4048.319
because I'm not gonna reach the Dome

4046.16 --> 4051.16
with a balloon that's literally

4048.319 --> 4051.16
impossible

4051.859 --> 4057.5
only way I could even conceive of

4054.319 --> 4061.46
potentially touching the Dome would be

4057.5 --> 4065.059
through some kind of momentum

4061.46 --> 4068.0
to carry through the super low density

4065.059 --> 4070.6400000000003
layers which a balloon could never go

4068.0 --> 4073.339
through it wouldn't go there

4070.64 --> 4078.5789999999997
it can't it's not

4073.339 --> 4078.5789999999997
low density enough and it never will be

4082.52 --> 4089.38
there's no domes yeah Dome Dome flat top

4086.0 --> 4089.38
whatever the barrier

4099.259 --> 4105.94
yeah but look for stuff it's pointless

4101.779 --> 4105.9400000000005
you can't make a balloon

4106.219 --> 4110.56
that is like no density

4111.92 --> 4119.0
that doesn't work it's never going to

4114.92 --> 4121.64
touch the Dome it's very likely it's

4119.0 --> 4124.52
near to zero pressure right next to it

4121.64 --> 4127.64
nothing can move through that through

4124.52 --> 4129.92
relative density it's never gonna happen

4127.64 --> 4132.1
doesn't matter what kind of device you

4129.92 --> 4132.1
have

4135.219 --> 4140.06
type of material it doesn't matter you

4137.9 --> 4142.94
can't get there with a balloon relative

4140.06 --> 4144.799
density could never make you make the

4142.94 --> 4148.58
device touch the Dome

4144.799 --> 4152.48
can't work never ever you understand

4148.58 --> 4154.219
only momentum could potentially in some

4152.48 --> 4156.379999999999
fashion

4154.219 --> 4159.259
carry an object

4156.38 --> 4162.4400000000005
through the super low density layers in

4159.259 --> 4165.5
order to touch the Dome or flat top or

4162.44 --> 4169.659
whatever is actually

4165.5 --> 4169.659
causing us to have gas pressure up there

4169.699 --> 4172.659
and down here

4186.56 --> 4189.92
what

4188.839 --> 4194.44
what

4189.92 --> 4194.4400000000005
where did that come from getting wisdom

4207.32 --> 4215.12
How can there be zero gas pressure not

4210.32 --> 4219.08
zero not perfect zero I said near zero

4215.12 --> 4222.44
the point is why I said that is there is

4219.08 --> 4225.199
no balloon that could ever naturally

4222.44 --> 4229.219
lift up high enough through relative

4225.199 --> 4231.678999999999
density in order to touch the flat top

4229.219 --> 4235.54
or Dome whatever it is

4231.679 --> 4235.54
that can never work

4244.4 --> 4250.04
what is pressure at the Dome

4247.699 --> 4252.98
it's still pressure it's just very low

4250.04 --> 4255.14
and it's very likely that there is a

4252.98 --> 4258.218999999999
super cold element

4255.14 --> 4258.219
so it's very cold

4268.84 --> 4272.38
all right look

4274.04 --> 4277.94
yeah your comments have a correlation I

4276.26 --> 4279.38
don't see it though

4277.94 --> 4283.879999999999
like

4279.38 --> 4288.14
yeah why do women why do mothers

4283.88 --> 4290.4800000000005
think Super far ahead into the future

4288.14 --> 4291.92
about their children because that's what

4290.48 --> 4294.44
mothers do

4291.92 --> 4297.4400000000005
they have a unique spiritual ability

4294.44 --> 4299.96
like that a lot of them

4297.44 --> 4302.419999999999
they basically get obsessed with their

4299.96 --> 4305.06
own children and that's logical

4302.42 --> 4307.88
and then yeah then you can actually

4305.06 --> 4309.9800000000005
Envision what the future would be like

4307.88 --> 4312.92
even when you're not there

4309.98 --> 4315.08
don't know why they why she did that if

4312.92 --> 4317.54
it serves some specific purpose or if it

4315.08 --> 4320.84
was just her ultimate expression of

4317.54 --> 4325.78
motherliehood who knows

4320.84 --> 4325.78
I don't yeah it came out of nowhere

4334.28 --> 4337.54
God

4335.5 --> 4339.86
stupid fly

4337.54 --> 4343.96
let's get that

4339.86 --> 4343.96
out of here oh

4360.02 --> 4363.400000000001
get out of here

4370.04 --> 4373.0
get out of here

4376.94 --> 4379.94
[ __ ]

4429.26 --> 4431.5
foreign

4439.96 --> 4444.86
for that shit's been going down for a

4442.699 --> 4446.96
long time though it's just now being

4444.86 --> 4448.46
weaponized

4446.96 --> 4450.38
look at how many people already

4448.46 --> 4452.12
basically got arrested because they were

4450.38 --> 4455.12
dumb enough to just confess their

4452.12 --> 4459.08
freaking crime with Visual Evidence on

4455.12 --> 4463.0599999999995
Facebook like a piece of [ __ ] yeah

4459.08 --> 4463.0599999999995
it's been going on for decades now

4480.14 --> 4484.76
right well clutch bear remember that

4483.02 --> 4486.679
yeah you want to leave Canada that's

4484.76 --> 4490.159000000001
exactly what they want they want all

4486.679 --> 4492.08
Canadians to leave all of them die leave

4490.159 --> 4494.48
and then as soon as they're all gone

4492.08 --> 4496.82
then the Chinese freaking claim the

4494.48 --> 4499.879999999999
country to be a completely hundred

4496.82 --> 4501.98
percent communist Chinese state right

4499.88 --> 4504.679
that's what happening that that's what's

4501.98 --> 4506.78
gonna happen yeah

4504.679 --> 4509.0
foreign

4506.78 --> 4511.759999999999
could do something about it

4509.0 --> 4514.28
but not without some serious serious

4511.76 --> 4517.280000000001
Bloodshed and I don't see that happening

4514.28 --> 4517.28
so

4521.78 --> 4526.219
like from all the countries in the world

4523.76 --> 4528.8
and all the situations unfolding it's

4526.219 --> 4531.9800000000005
blatantly obvious by now that literally

4528.8 --> 4536.4800000000005
Canada's government is trying to drive

4531.98 --> 4541.12
everybody away in order to hand over the

4536.48 --> 4541.12
country literally to China

4542.719 --> 4547.52
in its entirety it's like no you own it

4546.26 --> 4550.0
now

4547.52 --> 4550.0
right

4550.52 --> 4554.780000000001
Canada's government right now is

4552.739 --> 4558.94
probably one of the most corrupted

4554.78 --> 4558.94
governments it has ever had

4619.52 --> 4626.080000000001
right anyway

4622.52 --> 4626.080000000001
oh I've already been

4629.06 --> 4634.400000000001
training for yeah over an hour huh the

4632.36 --> 4636.86
time gauge got stuck

4634.4 --> 4639.46
after 70 minutes but that's definitely

4636.86 --> 4639.46
not the case

4639.98 --> 4645.919999999999
which people here would wake up

4642.14 --> 4647.27
let's see no no they just want to die

4645.92 --> 4647.84
they're just like

4647.27 --> 4649.84
[Music]

4647.84 --> 4649.84
um

4649.96 --> 4655.88
yeah yeah you're gonna [ __ ] die right

4652.76 --> 4658.88
now you stupid squirting piece of [ __ ]

4655.88 --> 4661.42
slave you're gonna die

4658.88 --> 4665.56
one way or the other freaking vaccine

4661.42 --> 4665.56
police state cracked down

4665.84 --> 4669.1990000000005
unless

4667.699 --> 4672.4
you yeah

4669.199 --> 4675.678999999999
get some of that ancestral

4672.4 --> 4678.799999999999
beefiness right like during World War II

4675.679 --> 4682.04
when your most awesome soldiers came

4678.8 --> 4684.92
over here to to help us out

4682.04 --> 4688.64
yeah if you don't find that back you're

4684.92 --> 4691.6990000000005
all going to die in Canada

4688.64 --> 4697.06
they're literally gonna wipe you out

4691.699 --> 4697.0599999999995
these satanic sellouts scumbags

4699.32 --> 4702.46
yeah good luck

4704.179 --> 4708.86
either beef up or die

4707.06 --> 4710.360000000001
you don't really have another Choice oh

4708.86 --> 4712.46
yeah or you could leave of course you

4710.36 --> 4713.9
could just go away to America or

4712.46 --> 4716.38
whatever

4713.9 --> 4716.379999999999
right

4733.04 --> 4735.28
foreign

4757.699 --> 4760.839999999999
dude like

4763.58 --> 4769.82
yeah that's right Nathan r

4766.64 --> 4773.02
that's definitely on the list but

4769.82 --> 4776.799999999999
taking things from the United States is

4773.02 --> 4776.8
much more tricky

4777.199 --> 4782.678999999999
right the United States

4779.78 --> 4782.679
like Canada

4783.38 --> 4788.2390000000005
they never really had to fight for their

4785.78 --> 4790.759999999999
independence from the crown right it's

4788.239 --> 4793.159
basically sort of a semi-colony thing

4790.76 --> 4794.8
it's weird the British infrastructure is

4793.159 --> 4797.36
very

4794.8 --> 4800.6
complex regions

4797.36 --> 4802.58
things States

4800.6 --> 4806.120000000001
so yeah

4802.58 --> 4808.28
America you can't just literally take a

4806.12 --> 4811.58
state from them and they'll just let you

4808.28 --> 4815.0
get away with it from that point on no

4811.58 --> 4815.0
Canada yeah

4820.76 --> 4825.679
oh yeah running for public office what a

4823.94 --> 4828.62
great idea

4825.679 --> 4830.659
that's gonna work that's gonna work so

4828.62 --> 4833.3
well

4830.659 --> 4837.32
with my Approach oh that'll rub off

4833.3 --> 4839.3
great it's not like I'm going to be

4837.32 --> 4841.5199999999995
Trump squared

4839.3 --> 4843.860000000001
right

4841.52 --> 4847.1
that literally there's gonna be voice

4843.86 --> 4849.86
recognition software to literally erase

4847.1 --> 4852.320000000001
every time I speak automatically on your

4849.86 --> 4854.54
own computer if I would go and do that

4852.32 --> 4857.9
so that literally nobody even would know

4854.54 --> 4862.719
I exist yeah no I know that's a little

4857.9 --> 4866.659
bit of an Etc what the why the [ __ ]

4862.719 --> 4870.52
would I become a politician

4866.659 --> 4870.5199999999995
it's the most ridiculous thing ever

4877.36 --> 4880.688999999999
[Music]

4885.02 --> 4888.280000000001
stupid YouTube today

4896.36 --> 4898.96
no

4899.54 --> 4903.739
I couldn't think of something more

4901.639 --> 4905.6
destructive to do with my life with

4903.739 --> 4909.739
everything I've tried to achieve so far

4905.6 --> 4912.38
than to actually go for public office

4909.739 --> 4914.12
but hey I'm open

4912.38 --> 4917.719
for a discussion

4914.12 --> 4919.159
I'll be anyone's Think Tank

4917.719 --> 4921.9800000000005
anyone

4919.159 --> 4924.379999999999
and it's already what I'm doing

4921.98 --> 4927.138999999999
even though it's kind of in

4924.38 --> 4929.659000000001
being Shadow banned doesn't matter I I

4927.139 --> 4933.46
bet there's a whole range of people that

4929.659 --> 4933.46
are watching very carefully

4933.739 --> 4941.32
never gonna run public office my God

4937.639 --> 4941.32
it's the worst idea ever

4944.29 --> 4947.42
[Music]

4952.88 --> 4960.02
like how why would you even think that

4956.54 --> 4961.94
somebody in public office can fix the

4960.02 --> 4965.3
situation

4961.94 --> 4967.5199999999995
what empirical evidence do you have that

4965.3 --> 4971.860000000001
people like that can

4967.52 --> 4971.860000000001
and actually fix the situation

4972.199 --> 4975.46
any situation

4981.739 --> 4987.94
I think politicians can fix is their own

4985.219 --> 4987.94
situation

5006.179 --> 5013.179
uh Stephen how long do you think that

5009.82 --> 5014.32
that's gonna stay a secret right so just

5013.179 --> 5016.78
a secret

5014.32 --> 5018.36
terrorist assassination

5016.78 --> 5021.04
group

5018.36 --> 5023.219
uh how long you think that's gonna be a

5021.04 --> 5023.219
secret

5023.92 --> 5028.6
that's not gonna last very long that's

5026.26 --> 5032.139
going to be over very quick

5028.6 --> 5035.08
and if it wouldn't it would be very easy

5032.139 --> 5040.26
to lure us into killing the wrong person

5035.08 --> 5040.26
and then framing us with that yeah no

5041.98 --> 5046.739
you got any more bright ideas steamy

5044.44 --> 5046.739
Traveler

5061.86 --> 5070.179
the solution is to see through lies at

5066.94 --> 5073.48
all lies all of them from inside from

5070.179 --> 5076.42
outside from way in the past onto the

5073.48 --> 5078.9
future the the only solution is to

5076.42 --> 5082.84
figure out the truth no matter the cost

5078.9 --> 5087.638999999999
truth no matter the cost truth no matter

5082.84 --> 5090.400000000001
the cost truth no matter the cost

5087.639 --> 5093.04
that's my solution

5090.4 --> 5095.199
my personal solution

5093.04 --> 5098.139
I think it's

5095.199 --> 5101.259999999999
a little far-fetched for most

5098.139 --> 5104.4400000000005
right you're only human

5101.26 --> 5106.4800000000005
yeah that's my solution though that's

5104.44 --> 5109.5599999999995
how I attend to

5106.48 --> 5109.5599999999995
do what I do

5109.659 --> 5112.86
somebody has to

5115.0 --> 5121.659
my goal is not to attain Earthly power

5118.06 --> 5124.360000000001
or control to fix the thing it's Earthly

5121.659 --> 5125.679
power and control that created all the

5124.36 --> 5127.12
problems

5125.679 --> 5130.36
all of them

5127.12 --> 5133.599999999999
why would I think that I could

5130.36 --> 5137.219
become what caused all the problems in

5133.6 --> 5137.219
order to solve all the problems

5138.699 --> 5141.419999999999
hmm

5144.28 --> 5148.12
although technically it's not even true

5146.26 --> 5150.34
because it's not even the politicians

5148.12 --> 5153.159
and all that that caused the problems

5150.34 --> 5155.8
it's the people indulging

5153.159 --> 5159.4
that actually causes the problems but

5155.8 --> 5161.56
it's always a too polar situation it's

5159.4 --> 5163.599999999999
the enabler

5161.56 --> 5167.26
which are the powers

5163.6 --> 5172.679
and it is the indulging masses

5167.26 --> 5172.679
that enforce that power that make it so

5174.28 --> 5178.199
whether they realize it or not

5196.6 --> 5200.860000000001
well steamy traveler the whole point of

5198.82 --> 5204.099999999999
this of doing that

5200.86 --> 5207.46
the truth no matter the cost

5204.1 --> 5209.5
is that if everything starts to abide by

5207.46 --> 5213.219
those rules

5209.5 --> 5216.04
and eventually lies and control an evil

5213.219 --> 5218.02
dissipates because it gets recognized it

5216.04 --> 5219.76
can't find a way through into the

5218.02 --> 5222.88
darkness anymore

5219.76 --> 5225.9400000000005
without immediately being recognized and

5222.88 --> 5229.900000000001
uncovered and stopped

5225.94 --> 5232.419999999999
right not by another government but by

5229.9 --> 5234.9
all the people recognizing what what is

5232.42 --> 5234.9
being done

5239.92 --> 5246.12
yeah sorry for the tone

5242.92 --> 5246.12
a steamy Traveler

5247.12 --> 5253.26
their legitimate questions it's like

5250.179 --> 5253.26
almost like a

5253.48 --> 5257.98
an interviewer question it's actually a

5256.12 --> 5261.099999999999
good question that a lot of people might

5257.98 --> 5264.159
be asking it's just that the idea of

5261.1 --> 5266.92
doing that it doesn't solve anything and

5264.159 --> 5269.138999999999
I hope I explained that properly

5266.92 --> 5271.9
so the condescending tone was not

5269.139 --> 5273.28
directed towards you it's towards those

5271.9 --> 5276.638999999999
questions

5273.28 --> 5279.84
to the questions on themselves

5276.639 --> 5279.84
and where they come from

5294.0 --> 5298.8
there is no infinite energy from ether

5297.48 --> 5301.659
[Music]

5298.8 --> 5302.76
and it doesn't solve anything Infinite

5301.659 --> 5307.9
Energy

5302.76 --> 5310.38
in infinite Earthly energy doesn't solve

5307.9 --> 5310.379999999999
anything

5311.92 --> 5316.84
yeah

5313.9 --> 5320.5199999999995
you don't solve problems by adding more

5316.84 --> 5320.52
Earthly things to the pool

5323.98 --> 5331.78
if there's an infinite of something then

5327.46 --> 5333.4
people will get used to it and find ways

5331.78 --> 5336.099999999999
to

5333.4 --> 5339.699
spill all of it

5336.1 --> 5342.280000000001
they will there's infinite how long do

5339.699 --> 5346.0
you think infinite will last

5342.28 --> 5348.34
once people really think it's infinite

5346.0 --> 5350.8
it's not gonna last very long there is

5348.34 --> 5351.82
no infinite ether energy there is a lot

5350.8 --> 5353.92
of it

5351.82 --> 5357.46
there's no infinite there is nothing

5353.92 --> 5360.28
infinite in the Physical Realm nothing

5357.46 --> 5363.58
is infinite in the Physical Realm not

5360.28 --> 5367.36
the volume not the amount of energy not

5363.58 --> 5370.96
the total preponderance of time

5367.36 --> 5374.08
nothing physical is infinite there's

5370.96 --> 5379.8
energy there is going to be a quantity

5374.08 --> 5379.8
never infinite that's that's illogical

5394.239 --> 5399.12
what the hell are you talking about

5400.239 --> 5406.228999999999
foreign

5402.76 --> 5406.229
[Music]

5408.0 --> 5414.58
or you're just wrong

5411.58 --> 5416.98
if the ether contains Infinite Energy

5414.58 --> 5419.5
then the loss of thermodynamics is wrong

5416.98 --> 5422.138999999999
hmm what is wrong with this picture

5419.5 --> 5425.699
could it be the assumption that there is

5422.139 --> 5425.6990000000005
infinite energy huh

5427.239 --> 5433.0599999999995
you really think that the Assumption of

5429.52 --> 5435.46
infinite energy is the proof that the

5433.06 --> 5439.84
loss of thermodynamics are wrong could

5435.46 --> 5442.38
it be that the Assumption of it is wrong

5439.84 --> 5442.38
hmm

5469.679 --> 5476.08
Archimedes erroneous approximation dude

5473.139 --> 5480.46
who gives a [ __ ] about freaking math

5476.08 --> 5480.46
it's just math cares

5482.32 --> 5488.94
math is not physical reality it's just

5485.32 --> 5488.94
an extract I'll be back in two minutes

5583.54 --> 5585.719
foreign

5611.679 --> 5614.679
Ty

5618.3 --> 5622.08
it's conceptual

5623.02 --> 5628.06
you're reifying mathematical Concepts

5626.199 --> 5630.719
into physical

5628.06 --> 5630.719
things

5681.34 --> 5686.32
you just got here it's flat well you're

5684.04 --> 5688.9
very very late normally I wouldn't even

5686.32 --> 5690.659
be streaming at this time so you're just

5688.9 --> 5695.199
very very late

5690.659 --> 5698.08
2PM Amsterdam time 2-3

5695.199 --> 5702.178999999999
p.m Amsterdam time that's when I

5698.08 --> 5702.179
normally stream on a Sunday

5707.98 --> 5714.099999999999
right so does anybody else wanna

5711.58 --> 5716.32
address anything otherwise I'm gonna run

5714.1 --> 5720.0
out the show

5716.32 --> 5720.0
it's been interesting so far

5722.679 --> 5729.6990000000005
nice and complex deep esoterics the way

5727.6 --> 5734.02
I like it

5729.699 --> 5737.08
and I appreciate that most of you

5734.02 --> 5740.1990000000005
typically following me in chat know how

5737.08 --> 5743.199
to actually apply it as well that you

5740.199 --> 5746.379999999999
basically get on the same

5743.199 --> 5748.48
type of insight as I do my things I

5746.38 --> 5750.88
really appreciate that that means to me

5748.48 --> 5752.98
it's working

5750.88 --> 5754.78
it's working what I'm doing is working

5752.98 --> 5757.299999999999
my example

5754.78 --> 5759.58
me trying to open up the doors is

5757.3 --> 5761.320000000001
actually working because people are

5759.58 --> 5762.659
getting with it and they're showing

5761.32 --> 5766.0
natural

5762.659 --> 5768.099999999999
examples that would fall out of proof

5766.0 --> 5772.96
that the doors have opened as I

5768.1 --> 5775.84
attempted it very happy about that right

5772.96 --> 5779.679
so don't take my

5775.84 --> 5781.179
annoyed tone sometimes that I sometimes

5779.679 --> 5783.54
have in response to certain questions

5781.179 --> 5786.88
don't take it personal when I do that

5783.54 --> 5789.04
unless I say it's personal

5786.88 --> 5791.1990000000005
and then it's personal right when I'm

5789.04 --> 5794.56
actually talking to you as an individual

5791.199 --> 5798.82
start describing your specific behavior

5794.56 --> 5801.820000000001
if you literally associate with that if

5798.82 --> 5804.4
those that behavior is your thing

5801.82 --> 5806.94
then it is directed at you

5804.4 --> 5806.94
all right

5815.44 --> 5822.04
anyway

5817.54 --> 5824.199
ah right I'm gonna call it for today

5822.04 --> 5826.06
