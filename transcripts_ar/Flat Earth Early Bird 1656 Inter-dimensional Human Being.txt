76.74 --> 83.22
sport has been pretty decent recently so

80.1 --> 84.65899999999999
love to have that continue

83.22 --> 86.84
because

84.659 --> 91.68
saved me a whole lot of

86.84 --> 93.84
Anguish later on anyway weather today is

91.68 --> 95.4
absolutely beautiful

93.84 --> 97.5
it's

95.4 --> 100.799
it's warm

97.5 --> 102.06
it's blue sky but it's also cloudy here

100.799 --> 104.93900000000001
and there

102.06 --> 109.57900000000001
and with some nice wind

104.939 --> 109.579
it's just really beautiful beautiful day

111.24 --> 114.78
it's like not too hot like it was

113.22 --> 117.78
yesterday

114.78 --> 120.96000000000001
it really did start out too hard it by

117.78 --> 123.78
the way there was like a

120.96 --> 125.579
pretty big storm even during my show and

123.78 --> 127.5
that did last for a bit

125.579 --> 130.16
but then later in the evening it kind of

127.5 --> 130.16
cleared up again

130.259 --> 134.04
look at how beautiful all those clouds

132.66 --> 135.42
are

134.04 --> 138.319
so that just

135.42 --> 138.319
amazing

144.98 --> 149.84
beautiful Dutch Skies very typical

150.78 --> 157.44
right but anyway everything is really

154.68 --> 159.66
green still

157.44 --> 163.34
looks a little extra green now that

159.66 --> 163.34
there's this bucket of water

164.04 --> 168.06
that has fallen on top of us yesterday

166.8 --> 171.0
[Music]

168.06 --> 174.42000000000002
so yeah it's been guys it's been a great

171.0 --> 175.98
summer here overall it's been absolutely

174.42 --> 177.89999999999998
fantastic

175.98 --> 179.34
right

177.9 --> 182.28
also

179.34 --> 183.54
it seems

182.28 --> 186.54
like

183.54 --> 189.35999999999999
yeah I talked about yesterday that the

186.54 --> 191.78
cabinet has fallen well it seems loud

189.36 --> 191.78
that

192.54 --> 198.92
there's Maneuvers happening where the

195.48 --> 198.92
guy where basically the

198.959 --> 205.68
the counter cartel

201.72 --> 208.2
is pushing out the cartel

205.68 --> 209.22
I think this might really work

208.2 --> 211.379
s

209.22 --> 213.599
I hope so but I mean it's not going to

211.379 --> 216.98
be the last time but these guys are dug

213.599 --> 216.98
in like Alabama tickets

217.28 --> 223.319
would say

220.319 --> 227.29899999999998
and who who got that from

223.319 --> 227.29899999999998
Jesse Ventura in Predator

228.599 --> 233.28
but I mean these guys are really dug in

231.18 --> 235.86
this cartel here in the Netherlands and

233.28 --> 238.379
even if they get him out

235.86 --> 241.019
he's just kind of like the cherry on top

238.379 --> 242.28
there's still the entire cake that's in

241.019 --> 245.09900000000002
there

242.28 --> 248.519
so but it it's

245.099 --> 251.879
it feels very promising

248.519 --> 256.139
still extremely reserved about it

251.879 --> 258.419
but it this may actually work

256.139 --> 260.22
or may start working

258.419 --> 261.53999999999996
this might be the beginning of a good

260.22 --> 264.36
thing

261.54 --> 268.199
right so I'm kind of

264.36 --> 270.24
carefully enthusiastic about that

268.199 --> 273.84000000000003
right

270.24 --> 275.639
anyway low tarot 306 first in chat

273.84 --> 279.23999999999995
Richard G dank

275.639 --> 282.139
j e zet

279.24 --> 282.139
are we all doing

283.32 --> 289.58
showing us outside but it's only like 25

286.02 --> 289.58
of the Street yeah

291.72 --> 297.66
well I'm not here to give you like this

294.54 --> 299.94
super HD landscape that you can project

297.66 --> 302.40000000000003
on your walls and then feel like you're

299.94 --> 305.04
in arwen's room or something

302.4 --> 307.79999999999995
I'm just here to give you a rough

305.04 --> 312.32
picture so that you can

307.8 --> 312.32
get a feel of what type of weather it is

312.54 --> 316.28000000000003
anyway hey PJ Cru Shank

317.96 --> 324.12
temperature is 25 degrees much more

320.759 --> 326.72
doable low precipitation still high

324.12 --> 326.72
humidity

326.82 --> 330.78
yeah and the heat flash seems to have

329.28 --> 332.34
passed

330.78 --> 335.46
it's going to be

332.34 --> 338.28
28 degrees tomorrow it says and then 23

335.46 --> 340.13899999999995
after with some rain

338.28 --> 344.9
so it's going to be a little bit more

340.139 --> 344.90000000000003
rainy now I guess which is not bad

345.06 --> 350.1
I mean it's better than like scorching

347.28 --> 352.15999999999997
30 plus Heat

350.1 --> 355.639
without any water

352.16 --> 355.639
but yeah

363.96 --> 369.9
just better than what fake Woods

368.34 --> 373.88
oh wow

369.9 --> 373.88
somebody's in a shitty mood

374.28 --> 380.58
some somebody new you're new you might

377.759 --> 383.759
you're a gamma that's already clear

380.58 --> 386.69899999999996
let's see how belligerent

383.759 --> 389.819
you are as a gamma

386.699 --> 392.039
right but of course the screen the video

389.819 --> 394.86
screen is not good enough for the new

392.039 --> 397.5
person and it's almost as bad as the

394.86 --> 399.72
fake Woods in the background of my show

397.5 --> 401.039
so my show is just overall terrible

399.72 --> 405.97900000000004
isn't it

401.039 --> 405.979
J is that thanks for sharing that

406.199 --> 415.16
your opinion on this specific item is is

411.12 --> 415.16
very clear all right

415.8 --> 421.74
ah amoxy

419.28 --> 424.52
feeling a little shitty

421.74 --> 424.52
why is that

424.86 --> 429.259
heavy rain here in absolute cool

429.3 --> 433.919
all right Derek

432.18 --> 437.0
that's funny you you kind of had the

433.919 --> 437.0
same type of weather then

438.12 --> 444.74
unwell okay that is very vague

443.22 --> 447.84000000000003
foreign

444.74 --> 451.319
could it be something you eaten or you

447.84 --> 453.419
didn't eat well or you slept you stayed

451.319 --> 457.259
up too late

453.419 --> 459.37
or you you drank and you didn't eat any

457.259 --> 462.589
combination

459.37 --> 462.589
[Music]

463.68 --> 468.96
we would all probably prefer the real

466.38 --> 471.78
bad yeah but I already told you

468.96 --> 475.58
I'm not gonna stream

471.78 --> 475.58
with that as the background

478.5 --> 485.66
not doing it

481.02 --> 485.65999999999997
it's very inconvenient for me to do that

491.34 --> 497.099
I'd literally have to rearrange like how

494.88 --> 499.58
my furniture is here and I don't have

497.099 --> 499.58
that room

502.919 --> 508.74
yeah I just got negative no no I'm just

506.22 --> 510.36
telling you like hey you come in and

508.74 --> 511.979
first thing you start doing is

510.36 --> 516.659
complaining about

511.979 --> 520.14
the way my show look looks j z

516.659 --> 525.919
sub negative that's like a

520.14 --> 525.919
correct and Analysis that's what that is

527.87 --> 531.1
[Music]

535.68 --> 539.42
you don't really drink okay good to you

541.68 --> 544.279
okay

547.32 --> 553.6800000000001
it was an idea well thanks for your idea

551.22 --> 556.9200000000001
that I didn't ask for I mean did I ask

553.68 --> 558.899
like guys what can I do to make my show

556.92 --> 562.399
look better

558.899 --> 562.399
was I asking for any of that

565.74 --> 571.2
I mean I could give you all kinds of

569.06 --> 575.3
aesthetic advice

571.2 --> 575.3000000000001
based on what I'm getting from you

576.36 --> 579.5600000000001
am I doing that

580.2 --> 584.899
oh okay well okay yeah yeah yeah yeah

grumpy no I feel [ __ ] great

616.08 --> 620.12
I feel actually quite

622.09 --> 627.47
[Music]

629.0 --> 633.26
New World orders going down

633.32 --> 637.1600000000001
very happy about that

637.86 --> 642.5
because I don't want my country to turn

641.399 --> 645.839
into

642.5 --> 650.339
wef country I I don't want to be in a

645.839 --> 653.0400000000001
15-minute City and only getting food

650.339 --> 655.7600000000001
that is either fake meat

653.04 --> 655.76
bugs

656.42 --> 662.64
or Soylent Green I mean that that's

660.36 --> 664.8000000000001
what's gonna happen

662.64 --> 669.14
and I'm very glad that it seems like

664.8 --> 669.14
that's gonna be stopped here at least

680.1 --> 684.5
oh really

682.2 --> 686.399
eight ball pool

684.5 --> 688.5
Indonesians are really good at pool

686.399 --> 691.92
that's interesting

688.5 --> 694.079
hi okay I'm fairly decent at it I mean I

691.92 --> 696.54
used to be pretty good

694.079 --> 698.579
unless I was kind of like not very

696.54 --> 701.9399999999999
focused

698.579 --> 705.18
I used we used to have like a pool table

701.94 --> 708.1400000000001
my old Grandma's Farm where all the

705.18 --> 708.14
family would come together

708.24 --> 713.5790000000001
and we'd play pool there

711.66 --> 716.12
I think my brothers he was even more

713.579 --> 716.12
into it

717.779 --> 724.459
but yeah that's funny Indonesian players

721.5 --> 724.459
are really good at it

725.1 --> 729.5600000000001
you of course you beat them sure

736.68 --> 744.079
and it's Indonesians in Thailand okay

740.519 --> 744.079
I was not aware of that

744.16 --> 748.51
[Music]

752.579 --> 758.42
crap at snooker

754.44 --> 758.4200000000001
yeah but snooker is the real pool

758.76 --> 762.68
that's the that's the tough one

767.04 --> 770.3399999999999
right not gonna talk about this by the

769.26 --> 771.779
way

770.34 --> 774.6600000000001
[Music]

771.779 --> 776.04
a sports channel

774.66 --> 778.68
you know

776.04 --> 782.399
not at intervals tarot seems to want to

778.68 --> 785.399
turn it into a sports channel

782.399 --> 786.959
Derek maybe you should have like a

785.399 --> 789.66
a sports

786.959 --> 792.06
report Channel

789.66 --> 794.6999999999999
Flat Earth Sports

792.06 --> 798.8389999999999
and just have your crooked readout like

794.7 --> 801.24
oh I'm just gonna be slightly racist

798.839 --> 804.6
what yes today in English they create

801.24 --> 807.24
the cricket match was very very strong

804.6 --> 811.8000000000001
play from this side

807.24 --> 816.24
and of course the new player was very

811.8 --> 818.399
good yeah this is ridiculous uh but you

816.24 --> 821.1
I don't know if you wanted to if you

818.399 --> 825.24
really like talking about it

821.1 --> 828.899
you could have like a your own sports

825.24 --> 830.519
gossip Rapport Channel or something

828.899 --> 833.04
I mean why not

830.519 --> 835.079
you could even like since you're not

833.04 --> 836.8199999999999
like corporate or anything you would

835.079 --> 839.6389999999999
just be a YouTuber you could like turn

836.82 --> 841.2
it into sort of a sports report

839.639 --> 845.22
with

841.2 --> 847.98
Flat Earth things in it like every now

845.22 --> 850.2
and then you remind people that the

847.98 --> 851.22
field is actually on a flat plane and

850.2 --> 855.0790000000001
all that

851.22 --> 855.0790000000001
just because you can why not

856.26 --> 862.74
right anyway it's it's just an idea not

859.019 --> 866.36
saying you gotta do it yeah I'm not

862.74 --> 866.36
like Jay is that

867.42 --> 871.74
like oh you have to do this you have to

870.18 --> 874.8
do this tear it

871.74 --> 876.839
you should make it better you have to do

874.8 --> 878.8199999999999
this portrait no no it's just a fun idea

876.839 --> 881.4590000000001
maybe you like it maybe you're like I

878.82 --> 883.2600000000001
don't have the time for that [ __ ]

881.459 --> 886.459
or maybe that's just the thing you've

883.26 --> 886.459
been waiting for who knows

893.88 --> 900.0
but I mean I'll bet that if you do it

896.82 --> 902.1
you get a Frick ton of a follow dude

900.0 --> 904.019
every time you roll in my chat talking

902.1 --> 906.48
about Cricket or something like

904.019 --> 908.76
immediately five people Pike up and

906.48 --> 912.3000000000001
start talking about it in code like

908.76 --> 915.36
almost trying to not be seen talking

912.3 --> 917.3389999999999
about sports in my chat

915.36 --> 919.62
if you just had your own Channel with

917.339 --> 921.12
that like you'd you'd get a ton of

919.62 --> 923.4590000000001
following even if you were a flat

921.12 --> 927.68
earther I bet

923.459 --> 927.68
be there flatter sports reporter

930.959 --> 935.9399999999999
yes yes there it I know but you had to

you like playing crickets you don't like

975.779 --> 978.38
eating them

995.94 --> 998.839
oh

1005.36 --> 1010.519
they're giving me a tough time recently

1007.459 --> 1013.16
yeah yeah no Indonesians when when they

1010.519 --> 1014.779
get the spirit in something they're

1013.16 --> 1017.6
really hard to beat

1014.779 --> 1020.899
I know because I got that too

1017.6 --> 1022.5790000000001
it's like it maybe it's like a universal

1020.899 --> 1025.22
Indonesian thing or something but it's

1022.579 --> 1027.86
like if I'm not motivated to do

1025.22 --> 1030.5
something I'm basically like

1027.86 --> 1035.0
a really lazy bastard

1030.5 --> 1036.74
that's just like um like I sorry

1035.0 --> 1039.14
I wish I wasn't

1036.74 --> 1040.54
but that's how I've worked and it's like

1039.14 --> 1042.74
been

1040.54 --> 1044.959
annoying to me

1042.74 --> 1046.64
because I couldn't get myself motivated

1044.959 --> 1049.94
for things

1046.64 --> 1052.88
and then became unpopular in ways

1049.94 --> 1055.28
because of that right but hey when

1052.88 --> 1057.5
something does hit my Consciousness

1055.28 --> 1059.66
that's like

1057.5 --> 1061.52
yeah that's something I want to do then

1059.66 --> 1065.6000000000001
it's like a completely different story

1061.52 --> 1068.84
and I'm like a Superman at it like I'll

1065.6 --> 1071.1789999999999
be two or three times the person doing

1068.84 --> 1073.52
that thing and that's with that same

1071.179 --> 1074.72
enthusiasm I can literally like learn to

1073.52 --> 1078.08
do things

1074.72 --> 1079.94
in unusually quick speeds if I am

1078.08 --> 1081.74
properly motivated if I'm motivated to

1079.94 --> 1083.74
do something I will literally understand

1081.74 --> 1086.84
things in the future

1083.74 --> 1089.059
concerning it yeah that's how my mind

1086.84 --> 1091.34
starts to work if I am enthusiastic

1089.059 --> 1093.86
about something I will literally be able

1091.34 --> 1095.299
to predict the future about related

1093.86 --> 1099.5
things in it

1095.299 --> 1101.4189999999999
okay that's how far that goes and I

1099.5 --> 1104.12
guess that

1101.419 --> 1107.96
that enthusiasm

1104.12 --> 1112.2399999999998
driving you to be almost indefeatable is

1107.96 --> 1112.24
is kind of an Indonesian thing maybe

1117.08 --> 1121.58
I've met some Indonesian other people

1118.64 --> 1123.6200000000001
and yeah and in the family of course

1121.58 --> 1126.86
they are partially an amazing just like

1123.62 --> 1128.12
me for my dad's side

1126.86 --> 1131.299
I

1128.12 --> 1132.6399999999999
nephews and all that and they have the

1131.299 --> 1135.26
same thing

1132.64 --> 1137.1200000000001
like when they don't know what to do

1135.26 --> 1138.559
they're really [ __ ] useless and they

1137.12 --> 1141.559
seem kind of lame

1138.559 --> 1143.48
but when they have a plan they are

1141.559 --> 1144.9189999999999
awesome

1143.48 --> 1146.539
like

1144.919 --> 1147.919
when they're motivated when they want to

1146.539 --> 1152.02
do something when they want to achieve

1147.919 --> 1152.0200000000002
something they are awesome guys

1153.679 --> 1158.72
and that that's kind of I always took

1156.62 --> 1160.6999999999998
that for granted it's like it's like

1158.72 --> 1162.559
yeah they're just like me but I never

1160.7 --> 1165.6200000000001
thought about it it just felt the

1162.559 --> 1167.48
synchronicity with it now I'm analyzing

1165.62 --> 1168.3799999999999
it it's like yeah hey that is kind of a

1167.48 --> 1170.6
thing

1168.38 --> 1173.2600000000002
I guess

1170.6 --> 1173.26
huh

1174.14 --> 1179.3600000000001
any other sports thing okay fair enough

1176.6 --> 1182.08
turret you just make it cricket news

1179.36 --> 1182.08
then

1185.299 --> 1191.36
I mean do I'm not telling you that man

1188.78 --> 1192.98
you should have a daily news I'm not

1191.36 --> 1194.24
saying you have to talk about crickets

1192.98 --> 1196.76
every day

1194.24 --> 1199.4
it's just it could be a thing it could

1196.76 --> 1202.4
be a thing you might do if you wanted to

1199.4 --> 1205.3400000000001
it's just an idea

1202.4 --> 1206.539
it seemed like hey well you're really

1205.34 --> 1210.86
into that

1206.539 --> 1212.179
you know a lot about it you're smart

1210.86 --> 1216.1999999999998
you

1212.179 --> 1219.6200000000001
you yeah you could probably do it and

1216.2 --> 1221.96
and have a relatively successful small

1219.62 --> 1224.36
YouTube show with that

1221.96 --> 1226.52
and even like mixed Flat Earth into it

1224.36 --> 1229.2199999999998
for the fun of it why not you're not

1226.52 --> 1231.2
bound to any corporate sponsors or

1229.22 --> 1233.66
whatever to do it

1231.2 --> 1236.3600000000001
so I don't know it was just an idea kind

1233.66 --> 1240.14
of from your perspective I am kind of

1236.36 --> 1242.7199999999998
meddling with your with you sorry about

1240.14 --> 1244.96
that you're probably way too busy for

1242.72 --> 1244.96
that

1247.1 --> 1250.0
I don't know

1252.17 --> 1257.66
[Music]

1254.84 --> 1260.299
hey gently us

1257.66 --> 1261.5
the Jazz week yeah you can go [ __ ]

1260.299 --> 1265.059
yourself

1261.5 --> 1265.059
you're not gonna do that

1269.419 --> 1273.3000000000002
yeah it's a good thing you have no

1271.16 --> 1276.51
[ __ ] idea what he looks like

1273.3 --> 1276.51
[Music]

1287.23 --> 1293.42
[Music]

1296.44 --> 1301.5800000000002
right cool

1299.24 --> 1303.98
let's just let's just let it sit there

1301.58 --> 1306.1999999999998
it and who knows maybe at some point you

1303.98 --> 1309.2
could just do it

1306.2 --> 1312.98
you could just start doing it

1309.2 --> 1315.0800000000002
right often the best ideas yeah you get

1312.98 --> 1317.539
them you want to do them immediately but

1315.08 --> 1319.9399999999998
you kind of let need to let it sit

1317.539 --> 1322.76
until the time is right and then it just

1319.94 --> 1323.96
happens it's the same thing with me and

1322.76 --> 1327.86
YouTube here

1323.96 --> 1328.64
I mean I got tuned in in 2015 and I was

1327.86 --> 1330.6789999999999
like

1328.64 --> 1333.44
oh no I'm missing the boat I felt like

1330.679 --> 1335.539
I'm missing the Flat Earth but I want to

1333.44 --> 1338.6000000000001
be I like I have so much

1335.539 --> 1341.12
crazy [ __ ] to talk about like

1338.6 --> 1344.08
Flat Earth waking up to it going back to

1341.12 --> 1346.8799999999999
sleep waking up like I have so much Rich

1344.08 --> 1348.9189999999999
detail to talk about Flat Earth so I was

1346.88 --> 1351.74
just watching that I was like

1348.919 --> 1354.26
scared and like ah I want to participate

1351.74 --> 1356.24
but I was so scared

1354.26 --> 1358.58
so I kind of was just like

1356.24 --> 1362.24
letting it

1358.58 --> 1364.3999999999999
do yeah just letting it sit there and

1362.24 --> 1366.86
like go around in me and then at some

1364.4 --> 1369.5
point 2060 is like

1366.86 --> 1372.08
okay [ __ ] it I'm not gonna hold like I

1369.5 --> 1377.12
noticed that

1372.08 --> 1380.84
everyone out there wasn't growing in the

1377.12 --> 1382.1
curve as fast as where I would be able

1380.84 --> 1384.559
to go

1382.1 --> 1388.58
and I just noticed

1384.559 --> 1392.0
everyone out there is too slow

1388.58 --> 1395.539
I'm gonna have to get involved

1392.0 --> 1398.12
like you guys need me

1395.539 --> 1401.48
or you won't make it that's literally

1398.12 --> 1404.7199999999998
kind of the reason why I got on and like

1401.48 --> 1408.58
yeah I'm gonna have this channel

1404.72 --> 1408.58
I'm gonna start talking in the chat

1408.799 --> 1413.78
and then I'm gonna get to know these

1411.26 --> 1416.059
guys get on with them talk a little

1413.78 --> 1418.76
beget clumsy and I don't give a [ __ ]

1416.059 --> 1421.6399999999999
because man I had so much content just

1418.76 --> 1426.86
with sitting there it's not like oh oh

1421.64 --> 1429.26
hi hello uh Flat Earth uh what do I know

1426.86 --> 1434.059
about no dude I had so much it was just

1429.26 --> 1436.22
like yeah I'm sitting on at this Dam and

1434.059 --> 1439.94
like I don't know how long I can

1436.22 --> 1442.28
withhold it from breaking

1439.94 --> 1443.8400000000001
that's more like what I was like with

1442.28 --> 1445.3999999999999
flat Earth

1443.84 --> 1447.26
and so

1445.4 --> 1449.299
I just made the channel but I mean it

1447.26 --> 1451.94
took me like a year to get there even

1449.299 --> 1455.9189999999999
though I wanted it so much

1451.94 --> 1455.919
because I just had to like

1456.44 --> 1464.72
work out the spiritual Alchemy of it

1461.36 --> 1467.26
and and and also compare the spiritual

1464.72 --> 1471.38
Alchemy and my ideas that I had inside

1467.26 --> 1474.5
with other people and how they jump

1471.38 --> 1477.14
ideas and how fast they want to go and

1474.5 --> 1478.039
how much grasp into the distance they

1477.14 --> 1480.6200000000001
have

1478.039 --> 1483.86
it's like yeah I've just asked like how

1480.62 --> 1487.039
much grasp of the future do you have

1483.86 --> 1488.6
as in like how well can you see into the

1487.039 --> 1491.48
future like I can

1488.6 --> 1493.76
oh you you can't do that you don't know

1491.48 --> 1497.8600000000001
what the hell I'm talking about

1493.76 --> 1497.86
okay I guess uh

1497.9 --> 1503.48
I am yeah I guess I'm

1500.72 --> 1505.82
The World Isn't like exactly like me in

1503.48 --> 1509.96
that sense I guess not everybody can see

1505.82 --> 1512.84
into the future I guess okay well

1509.96 --> 1516.2
I guess I have to

1512.84 --> 1518.1789999999999
explain all that then

1516.2 --> 1520.64
I get visions

1518.179 --> 1521.659
it's freaky I get to see things in the

1520.64 --> 1523.5800000000002
future

1521.659 --> 1526.3400000000001
like literally

1523.58 --> 1528.98
but also just the way I work I see

1526.34 --> 1531.559
things and it's like oh confront me with

1528.98 --> 1533.8600000000001
something new blah blah blah blah oh

1531.559 --> 1537.32
it's interesting

1533.86 --> 1539.6589999999999
boom and it's like boom instantaneous

1537.32 --> 1541.7
crystallized ideas that I could

1539.659 --> 1543.7
basically talk about for 15 minutes I'm

1541.7 --> 1546.46
in

1543.7 --> 1549.98
understanding things about it

1546.46 --> 1553.6000000000001
when I basically never even had that

1549.98 --> 1553.6
subject crossed my thoughts before

1554.0 --> 1557.26
that's how I work

1557.84 --> 1562.8999999999999
and I guess that's not Universal

1567.26 --> 1572.179
right because the idea is they come like

1569.96 --> 1574.3400000000001
a bomb it's just boom

1572.179 --> 1576.5590000000002
it happened the idea already happened

1574.34 --> 1579.08
now it's up to me

1576.559 --> 1582.62
to catch up

1579.08 --> 1584.539
with my explanation about the idea that

1582.62 --> 1587.6589999999999
had already happened it's already there

1584.539 --> 1590.539
it's staring at me on the other side in

1587.659 --> 1593.96
my virtual mind

1590.539 --> 1597.5
and now it's up to me to translate that

1593.96 --> 1599.9
into palatable forms of communication so

1597.5 --> 1602.799
that other people can follow what I just

1599.9 --> 1602.799
saw in my mind

1603.02 --> 1606.58
and that's how I operate

1606.74 --> 1611.72
I you are pretty much deep

1609.74 --> 1615.6200000000001
it's funny that you mention that Aries

1611.72 --> 1618.76
because I was literally named Paul after

1615.62 --> 1618.76
Paul muadid

1619.46 --> 1625.96
that's my mother and my dad told me

1622.94 --> 1628.5800000000002
it was after Paul McCartney which is the

1625.96 --> 1631.7
first one I don't know it's not really

1628.58 --> 1633.9189999999999
worth it but also

1631.7 --> 1636.6200000000001
did you know that in my 20s I was

1633.919 --> 1639.679
actually considering changing my bad

1636.62 --> 1641.7199999999998
last name to atrates but that was in the

1639.679 --> 1643.88
yeah really it's kind of crazy right

1641.72 --> 1646.039
that would have been weird if it

1643.88 --> 1649.64
actually had been at tradies now

1646.039 --> 1652.72
but it would make my name the the

1649.64 --> 1657.0200000000002
acronyms of my full name would be Pa

1652.72 --> 1659.84
p-a-a and that seemed like fun Timmy

1657.02 --> 1662.84
and at the time I did not have a great

1659.84 --> 1665.0
liking it to my dad so I was like kind

1662.84 --> 1667.6999999999998
of ready to ditch that last name anyway

1665.0 --> 1670.46
now I don't feel like that anymore at

1667.7 --> 1671.539
all it's actually a realization like

1670.46 --> 1673.7
wait

1671.539 --> 1676.82
no that family

1673.7 --> 1679.279
line is actually pretty solid like if I

1676.82 --> 1682.779
have any Trace left of a real family

1679.279 --> 1682.779
community it's there

1683.659 --> 1687.7990000000002
and in that family even though they're

1686.059 --> 1690.559
very different from me they're not as

1687.799 --> 1693.08
intellectually oriented

1690.559 --> 1695.24
I get along with that side of the family

1693.08 --> 1697.76
better than with the other that seems to

1695.24 --> 1700.76
like always

1697.76 --> 1704.32
they do things in a different way and

1700.76 --> 1704.32
I just don't fit in there

1704.9 --> 1709.779
not really

1707.299 --> 1709.779
it's weird

1709.82 --> 1714.799
and I used to struggle with that because

1711.62 --> 1717.4399999999998
the side from my mother is really the

1714.799 --> 1722.779
family we always hung around with

1717.44 --> 1725.48
in my youth like to my up to my 20s

1722.779 --> 1727.4
but that's all side also just completely

1725.48 --> 1730.88
scattered when yeah

1727.4 --> 1733.64
a bunch of people started dying

1730.88 --> 1737.1200000000001
starting with my mother

1733.64 --> 1740.8600000000001
that my nephew from my for my aunt my

1737.12 --> 1740.86
mother's side and my grandmother

1741.919 --> 1746.1200000000001
mother of my mother and so like that

1744.08 --> 1748.76
entire family side also basically

1746.12 --> 1751.34
exploded and disintegrated

1748.76 --> 1753.5
not none of such things has happened on

1751.34 --> 1755.36
my dad's side of the family like his

1753.5 --> 1757.539
brothers are still all alive and all

1755.36 --> 1757.539
that

1758.36 --> 1762.1399999999999
even though one has actual depression

1761.179 --> 1764.659
issues

1762.14 --> 1767.2990000000002
all is life and he is like an old man

1764.659 --> 1770.98
and he's still crushing it and he has

1767.299 --> 1770.98
some pretty serious depression issues

1772.22 --> 1778.279
but he's like he's a badass

1775.94 --> 1780.2
even though he he's also kind of like he

1778.279 --> 1782.539
doesn't he kind of has issues with

1780.2 --> 1784.46
hating himself but it's it's exactly

1782.539 --> 1787.0
like me and he even recognized that

1784.46 --> 1787.0
about me

1788.48 --> 1792.679
although I think he might have it a

1790.399 --> 1795.76
little bit heavier like with him the

1792.679 --> 1798.5590000000002
self-loathing like really like

1795.76 --> 1801.559
is really punishing

1798.559 --> 1803.779
with me it's just this nuisance that's

1801.559 --> 1806.48
really distracting me and trying to flip

1803.779 --> 1808.76
me into the Reversed world all the time

1806.48 --> 1811.64
very different tendency

1808.76 --> 1814.039
form anyway

1811.64 --> 1817.3400000000001
yeah

1814.039 --> 1820.1
Chosen One confirmed

1817.34 --> 1822.52
yeah I am the special boy guys didn't

1820.1 --> 1822.52
you know

1822.74 --> 1828.1
well it's certainly damn well feels like

1824.96 --> 1828.1000000000001
I drank the water alive

1828.679 --> 1833.72
I mean what do you think that I mean I

1831.08 --> 1835.8799999999999
think there was even like pointed to me

1833.72 --> 1839.14
that it was that

1835.88 --> 1839.14
the thing that I did

1842.84 --> 1850.899
the yeah what made me

1847.039 --> 1850.899
enter the 80-year vision

1856.64 --> 1864.0800000000002
so yeah I mean it it sometimes I do

1861.02 --> 1867.86
really feel like kind of what it feel

1864.08 --> 1870.3799999999999
what I have a lot of like very personal

1867.86 --> 1874.34
empathy for the Paul a trades character

1870.38 --> 1876.919
like very personal as in not I always

1874.34 --> 1880.22
have empathy but with this it's like

1876.919 --> 1883.22
like he's me and I like I'm rooting for

1880.22 --> 1884.419
me in that story that's what it feels

1883.22 --> 1888.52
like

1884.419 --> 1888.5200000000002
it's like I could have been that guy

1892.12 --> 1898.6999999999998
man I wish I had like a a gurney Hallock

1896.059 --> 1901.6589999999999
as a personal defense trainer that would

1898.7 --> 1901.659
have been so awesome

1908.0 --> 1910.72
foreign

1916.64 --> 1919.64
ER

1920.36 --> 1924.4399999999998
the zagger desachar

1926.6 --> 1931.299
so how do you pronounce that

1931.82 --> 1936.1589999999999
is it desaka is it

1941.659 --> 1945.46
is it like Germanic

1947.48 --> 1952.1200000000001
anyway hello and yeah thanks for sharing

1949.94 --> 1952.1200000000001
that

1953.179 --> 1958.3400000000001
and your souls hurt

1955.94 --> 1960.559
right but it's also like

1958.34 --> 1961.8799999999999
you first even gotta recognize that it's

1960.559 --> 1963.5
happened

1961.88 --> 1966.64
right

1963.5 --> 1966.64
this Sayer

1966.799 --> 1969.76
oh okay

1971.48 --> 1975.6200000000001
listen whatever uh

1977.0 --> 1981.26
right

1978.74 --> 1983.24
so yeah if you're like down about

1981.26 --> 1984.799
something and you don't recognize it

1983.24 --> 1987.02
you're gonna stay in it because you

1984.799 --> 1990.1399999999999
don't see it and it's just overcoming

1987.02 --> 1992.779
you but if you see that it you have that

1990.14 --> 1995.1200000000001
then you can try to figure out what's

1992.779 --> 1997.82
actually causing it because sometimes

1995.12 --> 2000.2199999999998
things can like burden your mood that

1997.82 --> 2003.22
even you don't even consciously realize

2000.22 --> 2006.64
because your subconscious still does

2003.22 --> 2009.1000000000001
know the actual [ __ ] up nature of the

2006.64 --> 2011.679
situation you found yourself in right

2009.1 --> 2013.6
like if you cause if you cook to

2011.679 --> 2016.019
something you often forget a whole bunch

2013.6 --> 2016.019
of things

2017.5 --> 2023.26
oh as part of that but your subconscious

2021.159 --> 2026.679
still knows and then you and it will

2023.26 --> 2028.74
basically your subconscious will feel

2026.679 --> 2032.5800000000002
the failure that your Consciousness

2028.74 --> 2032.58
doesn't pick up on anymore

2033.039 --> 2037.419
so you gotta then reconnect see what's

2035.44 --> 2040.8600000000001
real and then you find out what's

2037.419 --> 2040.8600000000001
actually causing that mood

2044.08 --> 2049.659
so in ways

2045.94 --> 2053.08
future space futurism for me was often a

2049.659 --> 2056.44
form of escapism that made me hopeful

2053.08 --> 2058.72
for the unity of the entire system to

2056.44 --> 2061.179
still transform into something good to

2058.72 --> 2063.0989999999997
build on the future

2061.179 --> 2065.139
but because space and all that is

2063.099 --> 2067.839
actually not real but it's all buried

2065.139 --> 2069.76
underneath all that thing all those

2067.839 --> 2071.919
things that I do with it and the

2069.76 --> 2073.5400000000004
exposure on a television and all that

2071.919 --> 2075.0989999999997
and everybody talking about you learning

2073.54 --> 2078.159
about it in school

2075.099 --> 2081.76
I didn't realize that

2078.159 --> 2083.619
I'm seeking out false hope

2081.76 --> 2086.0800000000004
it's like chasing a dragon that you can

2083.619 --> 2088.839
never catch and it

2086.08 --> 2090.94
isn't fulfilling at all

2088.839 --> 2093.52
but you don't really consciously

2090.94 --> 2095.98
understand that you just feel like

2093.52 --> 2097.839
yeah you can do this but there's

2095.98 --> 2099.7
something wrong you just can't pinpoint

2097.839 --> 2102.4
it and I had issues with that every time

2099.7 --> 2107.2799999999997
it happened and I got agitated from this

2102.4 --> 2107.28
like why am I feeling about this

2107.8 --> 2111.7000000000003
and I wouldn't share it with other

2109.72 --> 2113.3799999999997
people because it's like I don't feel I

2111.7 --> 2116.7599999999998
feel shitty isn't just not a good thing

2113.38 --> 2116.76
to bring up in such a moment

2117.579 --> 2122.44
but it would happen and yeah when I

2119.92 --> 2125.94
figured out about Flat Earth all of that

2122.44 --> 2128.8
[ __ ] just immediately

2125.94 --> 2131.2000000000003
attained a Consciousness point it's like

2128.8 --> 2133.3590000000004
once you figure out Flat Earth there's

2131.2 --> 2135.339
so many things in your life that that

2133.359 --> 2136.66
you don't understand that suddenly makes

2135.339 --> 2140.32
sense

2136.66 --> 2143.339
and those include mood related things

2140.32 --> 2143.339
that you didn't understand

2144.52 --> 2149.98
because reality influences your mood and

2147.4 --> 2152.8
if there's false aspects that have been

2149.98 --> 2155.7
grafted into your reality that you don't

2152.8 --> 2155.7000000000003
see as fake

2156.24 --> 2160.9199999999996
then that will like

2158.859 --> 2164.92
cause

2160.92 --> 2164.92
unidentified moods

2165.579 --> 2169.8590000000004
where you don't understand where it's

2167.38 --> 2169.859
coming from

2171.4 --> 2177.54
but it's because

2173.619 --> 2177.54
you are following an illusion

2178.3 --> 2184.78
and your subconscious might pick up on

2181.72 --> 2186.3999999999996
that and and make you feel off or

2184.78 --> 2188.2000000000003
miserable

2186.4 --> 2189.76
even though your Consciousness has no

2188.2 --> 2192.5789999999997
idea why

2189.76 --> 2195.5200000000004
and flatter the real Awakening in Flat

2192.579 --> 2199.54
Earth really helped

2195.52 --> 2201.7
like place it all like why did you feel

2199.54 --> 2204.46
that way why did you feel that way there

2201.7 --> 2206.9199999999996
and there and there and it will make

2204.46 --> 2209.92
things fall in place where before you

2206.92 --> 2213.359
just didn't understand why

2209.92 --> 2213.359
why you felt that way

2214.42 --> 2219.16
I mean ignorance is ignorance of the

2217.0 --> 2222.66
globe is pretty Bliss

2219.16 --> 2222.66
but in the end you die

2224.079 --> 2231.1600000000003
but also it makes you just kind of like

2227.64 --> 2233.14
very fluid and subjected to all kinds of

2231.16 --> 2236.56
things that you don't understand so you

2233.14 --> 2238.72
basically get slapped around by life if

2236.56 --> 2241.48
you're a global believer because things

2238.72 --> 2245.56
happen to you that you don't

2241.48 --> 2247.54
really know how to place what you're

2245.56 --> 2250.0
feeling or what's happening

2247.54 --> 2251.44
you go about ignorant and so you don't

2250.0 --> 2253.24
understand a whole bunch of things you

2251.44 --> 2254.92
get slapped around but you just

2253.24 --> 2256.24
surrender you accept it's like oh that's

2254.92 --> 2258.46
just part of life

2256.24 --> 2261.7
yeah what not getting to understand and

2258.46 --> 2266.099
getting humiliated and not disoriented

2261.7 --> 2266.0989999999997
is just a part of life I don't think so

2266.2 --> 2271.4199999999996
yeah that's not a part of life

2269.14 --> 2274.5989999999997
that's not natural

2271.42 --> 2276.579
it only starts happening to you when you

2274.599 --> 2279.46
lost your way

2276.579 --> 2282.579
in what is real

2279.46 --> 2285.64
that's when that starts happening

2282.579 --> 2287.2000000000003
if you're awakened to what is real and

2285.64 --> 2290.3799999999997
how things really work

2287.2 --> 2292.8999999999996
then you don't have those issues

2290.38 --> 2295.7200000000003
it only happens when you're ignorant

2292.9 --> 2297.98
because you believe extensively in

2295.72 --> 2300.4599999999996
things that aren't real

2297.98 --> 2303.96
[Music]

2300.46 --> 2306.46
and you know what you believe in

2303.96 --> 2309.28
partially whether you this whether you

2306.46 --> 2311.26
figured it out or not you know on an

2309.28 --> 2314.7400000000002
intuitive level whether something is

2311.26 --> 2315.76
real or not based on how it influences

2314.74 --> 2319.5
you

2315.76 --> 2319.5
when you accepted it

2319.78 --> 2327.7000000000003
even before you know what it is

2323.44 --> 2330.579
because your subconscious does know

2327.7 --> 2332.5
what about it is true or not even if

2330.579 --> 2335.76
your Consciousness believes fully in it

2332.5 --> 2335.76
or is ignoring it or whatever

2339.94 --> 2346.7400000000002
oh Ares 106.

2343.66 --> 2346.74

Flat Earth is not a gender okay Cleary

2682.119 --> 2687.1800000000003
well

2684.22 --> 2687.18
go [ __ ] yourself

2688.78 --> 2696.7200000000003
I'm not like a cheap online

2692.339 --> 2696.72
speech prostitute so

2701.22 --> 2708.0
250 what

2703.839 --> 2708.0
okay well that's decent I guess

2714.52 --> 2719.619
but I mean I wouldn't really be a great

2717.22 --> 2721.8999999999996
debate I wouldn't be like Nathan Oakley

2719.619 --> 2726.9
quality or anything just for the record

2721.9 --> 2726.9
right like I don't do that anymore

2730.42 --> 2735.579
so

2732.4 --> 2738.28
I mean if I'm just gonna argue for

2735.579 --> 2740.8
Flat Earth against the globe or

2738.28 --> 2743.02
something like that I'd keep it so

2740.8 --> 2745.119
simple that it wouldn't be much of a

2743.02 --> 2747.7
show to listen to I'd say a couple of

2745.119 --> 2749.56
things and then if ignored I would

2747.7 --> 2751.96
simply discontinue

2749.56 --> 2754.54
I would just no longer respond like

2751.96 --> 2756.52
you're ignoring me it's like yeah okay

2754.54 --> 2759.46
well then I'm not gonna listen to you or

2756.52 --> 2761.859
[ __ ] because I know exactly what type of

2759.46 --> 2763.839
horse [ __ ] you're talking about

2761.859 --> 2767.02
it's right over there it's that part

2763.839 --> 2769.06
that part within the typical spectrum of

2767.02 --> 2772.079
choices of [ __ ] to talk about that

2769.06 --> 2772.0789999999997
you guys always talk about

2772.18 --> 2774.72
so

2775.119 --> 2782.94
he said I didn't see that

2778.599 --> 2782.94
where where now oh wait

2784.96 --> 2790.78
four shows a month

2787.3 --> 2796.92
for 250 no [ __ ] way

2790.78 --> 2796.92
make that 250 per show and I might do it

2800.579 --> 2806.8
thank you yeah there's no [ __ ] way

2803.859 --> 2809.44
I'm gonna do four shows

2806.8 --> 2812.8590000000004
like like that in the first place

2809.44 --> 2817.44
because I'm gonna be damn well sure that

2812.859 --> 2817.44
I'll be sick of it after one go

2818.2 --> 2822.7599999999998
unless the baller isn't going to be a

2821.02 --> 2825.099
piece of [ __ ] that just gotta wide and

2822.76 --> 2828.099
rumpus and we'll actually have some

2825.099 --> 2830.319
halfway decent conversation

2828.099 --> 2832.6600000000003
and then I might do it like twice but

2830.319 --> 2836.04
there's no [ __ ] way that I'm gonna do

2832.66 --> 2842.2799999999997
four tedious shows with Ballers for

2836.04 --> 2842.2799999999997
measly 250 dollars it's not even euros

2848.8 --> 2855.7000000000003
I mean that's literally 62 and a half

2852.339 --> 2860.68
Euro dollars so it's like

2855.7 --> 2862.72
50 euros for like City debating with a

2860.68 --> 2864.94
[ __ ] baller for probably an hour yeah

2862.72 --> 2867.04
that's not worth it

2864.94 --> 2869.68
that's not worth the energy that'll

2867.04 --> 2872.14
actually cost me to do that because that

2869.68 --> 2874.24
energy is gonna come out of the quality

2872.14 --> 2876.9
of my output on my own show and the

2874.24 --> 2876.8999999999996
flatter of debates

2878.14 --> 2885.4
right

2880.0 --> 2885.4
I mean I might do like four

2885.46 --> 2891.94
half hour debates for 250

2888.839 --> 2894.2799999999997
that's like that might be doable but I

2891.94 --> 2896.02
mean it's not really worth it then

2894.28 --> 2899.1400000000003
for them

2896.02 --> 2901.359
they want to drag it out endless re

2899.14 --> 2904.42
bickering and they just want to see

2901.359 --> 2908.56
people bleed spiritually that makes a

2904.42 --> 2910.98
good debate yeah I'm not doing that yeah

2908.56 --> 2910.98
oh

2912.52 --> 2917.079
I'm not gonna be dismantled for some

2915.579 --> 2919.2400000000002
money

2917.079 --> 2922.42
because why

2919.24 --> 2925.8999999999996
because it's more efficient to be poorer

2922.42 --> 2928.9
and eat less and not have

2925.9 --> 2932.14
a bunch of people publicly chip at your

2928.9 --> 2934.54
spirit that you actually need to survive

2932.14 --> 2937.319
eating less yeah I'm not doing it it's

2934.54 --> 2937.319
not worth it

2938.56 --> 2943.14
60 an hour isn't bad yeah it is bad

2946.9 --> 2953.7400000000002
I mean is 60 an hour

2949.72 --> 2955.66
as a prostitute it's not bad it is what

2953.74 --> 2957.7799999999997
you feel about it when I said it like

2955.66 --> 2957.7799999999997
that

2958.06 --> 2963.5789999999997
or you could just oh 60 an hour man you

2961.24 --> 2966.2799999999997
could make like a

2963.579 --> 2969.099
you could make like uh what is it 600

2966.28 --> 2972.0400000000004
bucks a day yeah really try it try that

2969.099 --> 2974.26
out yeah like you could survive that

2972.04 --> 2975.52
you would have to be one hell of a

2974.26 --> 2979.8390000000004
sturdy

2975.52 --> 2983.2599999999998
sturdy girl to to survive that okay yeah

2979.839 --> 2987.5789999999997
so 60 an hour yeah that is bad because

2983.26 --> 2989.2000000000003
of how much it chips away at my spirit

2987.579 --> 2990.76
yeah

2989.2 --> 2993.22
it's like

2990.76 --> 2996.94
oh yeah you could just work at the glue

2993.22 --> 2998.74
factory a chemical Glue Factory I mean

2996.94 --> 3001.2000000000003
yeah so you can always have that job

2998.74 --> 3004.4399999999996
yeah and then watch

3001.2 --> 3006.54
my brain steadily declined because of

3004.44 --> 3008.099
the constant fumes that hang around and

3006.54 --> 3010.44
I can already see where that's going

3008.099 --> 3012.839
with all the people that already work

3010.44 --> 3014.88
there all their lives that look like a

3012.839 --> 3017.88
bunch of zombies

3014.88 --> 3020.04
yeah oh but but it's good pay yeah yeah

3017.88 --> 3023.7200000000003
that's not worth it

3020.04 --> 3023.72
it's not worth it foreign

3027.2 --> 3032.8799999999997
yeah you could say it like that's very

3029.819 --> 3035.9
very smart ass of you Aries 106 but you

3032.88 --> 3035.9
are technically correct

3037.319 --> 3041.2799999999997
right so

3039.359 --> 3044.2799999999997
no offense

3041.28 --> 3046.02
take taken by the way I'm appeal it was

3044.28 --> 3047.6400000000003
a bit of a rough example there but I

3046.02 --> 3050.4
mean

3047.64 --> 3052.92
yeah 60 an hour isn't bad money if it

3050.4 --> 3058.099
was a very doable job yeah

3052.92 --> 3062.339
you sit just imagine your job is

3058.099 --> 3064.88
publicly debating bickering anti-flat

3062.339 --> 3064.88
earthers

3066.42 --> 3071.04
you think you could do that

3068.4 --> 3073.079
eight hours a day the pay is great

3071.04 --> 3075.24
though how long you think you could hold

3073.079 --> 3077.04
that up how long you think you could do

3075.24 --> 3080.7599999999998
that

3077.04 --> 3084.119
dude you'd be [ __ ]

3080.76 --> 3085.0200000000004
holding off Suicidal Thoughts within a

3084.119 --> 3087.7400000000002
week

3085.02 --> 3087.74
okay

3090.9 --> 3096.7200000000003
there's no [ __ ] way

3093.24 --> 3098.5789999999997
doesn't matter how good the pay is

3096.72 --> 3101.52
it's not doable

3098.579 --> 3103.4
it's like oh hey yeah we can we have

3101.52 --> 3105.96
like this great

3103.4 --> 3109.26
entertainment industry makes you huge

3105.96 --> 3111.18
amount of money yeah yeah it's it's soft

3109.26 --> 3113.3390000000004
torture porn

3111.18 --> 3115.2
but it looks really real you just have

3113.339 --> 3118.2599999999998
to like sit through that

3115.2 --> 3120.74
and you'll get like 500 bucks for an

3118.26 --> 3122.88
hour or something

3120.74 --> 3125.4599999999996
but yeah

3122.88 --> 3129.0
dude

3125.46 --> 3131.28
it will [ __ ] you up though

3129.0 --> 3133.98
because even though it's pretend there's

3131.28 --> 3136.44
no actual torture happening

3133.98 --> 3138.48
everybody's acting like it's real the

3136.44 --> 3141.54
spirit of it's gonna be real it's gonna

3138.48 --> 3144.42
[ __ ] eat you up alive

3141.54 --> 3146.88
like the real thing oh but it gets great

3144.42 --> 3150.839
pay it's not real oh yeah it's oh it's

3146.88 --> 3153.78
just yeah but it's gonna [ __ ] you up

3150.839 --> 3156.599
great pay though huh

3153.78 --> 3159.059
I mean that must be a great job if you

3156.599 --> 3161.2200000000003
are literally a born psychopath and you

3159.059 --> 3162.96
don't have that kind of stress build up

3161.22 --> 3165.1189999999997
because you don't have those senses to

3162.96 --> 3167.78
build up that kind of stress

3165.119 --> 3167.78
right

3168.119 --> 3173.579
it's yeah

3170.64 --> 3176.52
it's got to be durable

3173.579 --> 3181.7000000000003
great pay means nothing if it's not

3176.52 --> 3181.7
durable if you can't keep doing it

3184.74 --> 3190.0789999999997
I mean hey did you know like I even like

3188.099 --> 3193.46
20 years ago and more

3190.079 --> 3197.28
this is great you could get great pay

3193.46 --> 3201.059
for being medically experimented on yeah

3197.28 --> 3202.26
well you could get like 200 to 500 euros

3201.059 --> 3205.619
man

3202.26 --> 3208.8590000000004
for for just sitting there and and

3205.619 --> 3211.2200000000003
taking some pills or getting an

3208.859 --> 3211.22
injection

3213.359 --> 3218.7599999999998
but it gets great pay yeah yeah that's a

3216.72 --> 3222.68
real durable career it's not like

3218.76 --> 3222.6800000000003
something's gonna go wrong at some point

3224.339 --> 3228.859
right and that's why they kind of

3226.319 --> 3232.22
stopped doing that and and just kind of

3228.859 --> 3235.38
forced it on the public so instead of

3232.22 --> 3237.66
well-paid medical experimentation that

3235.38 --> 3239.52
leaves wrecks

3237.66 --> 3241.2599999999998
it's kind of slow in its progress

3239.52 --> 3243.18
because it's not enough volunteer that

3241.26 --> 3246.2400000000002
they just like yeah let's make more

3243.18 --> 3247.6189999999997
progress let's just force everybody to

3246.24 --> 3250.3799999999997
participate

3247.619 --> 3252.839
with a giant uh psychological assault

3250.38 --> 3254.099
and if you fall for it you just became

3252.839 --> 3255.9
volunteer for the medical

3254.099 --> 3259.02
experimentation

3255.9 --> 3260.64
and people yeah the people that are

3259.02 --> 3262.859
smart enough to figure that out that

3260.64 --> 3264.9
just won't do it and I have to take a

3262.859 --> 3267.2999999999997
bit of a

3264.9 --> 3269.52
bit of a beating financially but I mean

3267.3 --> 3272.0
at least they will in the end be the

3269.52 --> 3272.0
survivors

3274.38 --> 3281.52
but yet in the past medical industry did

3278.579 --> 3283.26
experimentations on people for a lot of

3281.52 --> 3284.819
pay they got a lot of money for that

3283.26 --> 3287.2200000000003
[ __ ]

3284.819 --> 3289.74
what I mean things can't go wrong and

3287.22 --> 3291.54
then you're [ __ ] forever you can't get

3289.74 --> 3293.339
any money for it because that's what you

3291.54 --> 3297.119
get paid for it's basically insurance

3293.339 --> 3300.0
pay insurance not to sue them they pay

3297.119 --> 3304.04
you to be experimented on so that if

3300.0 --> 3304.04
things go wrong you can't sue them

3304.319 --> 3306.92
yeah

3306.96 --> 3312.54
that's how it used to work

3309.78 --> 3315.3590000000004
it was Fallen voluntary

3312.54 --> 3316.8
so it was just a job thing that you

3315.359 --> 3320.66
could do and never done it by the way

3316.8 --> 3320.6600000000003
but I knew people that did

3322.099 --> 3326.099
pretty creepy

3329.64 --> 3335.5789999999997
now it's just like oh well we're just

3332.64 --> 3337.3799999999997
gonna mandate it except you can't really

3335.579 --> 3339.1800000000003
mandate but we're gonna suggest it's

3337.38 --> 3342.3
mandated so people that are dumb enough

3339.18 --> 3344.7599999999998
to just immediately fall in line

3342.3 --> 3346.02
to whatever comes rolling out of the

3344.76 --> 3351.599
black box

3346.02 --> 3354.059
they will be our involuntary but still

3351.599 --> 3356.7000000000003
secretly voluntary

3354.059 --> 3360.1400000000003
experiment participants

3356.7 --> 3360.14
that's what they've done now

3360.3 --> 3365.46
problem though is is that yeah it was

3362.099 --> 3367.5
very profitable for them like really

3365.46 --> 3370.619
progressed a lot of research that I

3367.5 --> 3376.319
could have never done with that pace

3370.619 --> 3379.2000000000003
but it was brutally illegal

3376.319 --> 3381.44
and it will lead to like the death

3379.2 --> 3384.0589999999997
penalty on a whole bunch of these people

3381.44 --> 3386.46
that have organized that

3384.059 --> 3390.119
so yeah that's the downside you know but

3386.46 --> 3392.819
right for medical progress right

3390.119 --> 3395.4
having a couple of Executives executed

3392.819 --> 3398.42
for war crimes and all that yeah that

3395.4 --> 3398.42
that's worth it right

3405.3 --> 3412.98
250 to troll four shows as Baldwin

3410.099 --> 3414.9
that's but who the hell would I troll

3412.98 --> 3417.359
and they would really [ __ ] hate me

3414.9 --> 3419.52
after that though

3417.359 --> 3423.38
damn could you imagine

3419.52 --> 3423.38
me up against Nathan

3423.48 --> 3427.8
I would literally working up to the

3425.64 --> 3429.18
point where he would shout at me like an

3427.8 --> 3433.079
anti-flat earther

3429.18 --> 3435.6189999999997
but I'd feel really bad afterwards like

3433.079 --> 3435.619
sorry

3446.24 --> 3450.8999999999996
it's hilarious though

3448.559 --> 3453.78
I mean I think that I could probably do

3450.9 --> 3457.079
that better Ares 106.

3453.78 --> 3459.599
it's less tedious than to have having to

3457.079 --> 3462.8390000000004
keep it absolutely real On My Level

3459.599 --> 3465.119
against anti-flatter it would be more

3462.839 --> 3467.339
fun for me to do it as Bowen from the

3465.119 --> 3469.1600000000003
ball side because dude there's so much

3467.339 --> 3473.4
maneuvering room if you're smart enough

3469.16 --> 3479.42
there's so much [ __ ] to pick from

3473.4 --> 3479.42
right endless straw man scatter gunning

3479.78 --> 3483.78
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3487.93 --> 3493.0789999999997
[Music]

3490.2 --> 3495.54
endless scatter guarding [ __ ] you

3493.079 --> 3498.8390000000004
can never make it stop

3495.54 --> 3502.2
I will never stop giving you [ __ ]

3498.839 --> 3506.22
excuses I will never

3502.2 --> 3508.2
decrease it yeah I can do that

3506.22 --> 3511.0789999999997
yeah I mean

3508.2 --> 3513.2599999999998
not it's not Tommy Gun scatter like the

3511.079 --> 3513.26
classic

3513.319 --> 3520.079
you're gonna get it see

3516.2 --> 3522.66
no it's OC time it's like oh you think

3520.079 --> 3525.44
you got an argument for the Flat Earth

3522.66 --> 3525.44
well what about

3527.04 --> 3532.7
yeah I know they're very small bullets

3528.96 --> 3532.7
but it's [ __ ] intimidating

3532.92 --> 3539.42
you can never find out it'll take you a

3535.5 --> 3539.42
week just to find back all those bullets

3540.24 --> 3544.0989999999997
that were fired in like 10 seconds

3547.74 --> 3553.859
yeah [ __ ] Rena don't literally though I

3551.28 --> 3557.96
don't know if that's even possible

3553.859 --> 3557.96
uh I don't want to know

3560.099 --> 3566.42
yeah I'm not gonna go up against Brenda

3562.619 --> 3566.42
even for a [ __ ] thousand dollars

3566.819 --> 3574.819
no way I'm not not gonna be on any show

3572.04 --> 3574.819
with Brenda

3575.64 --> 3581.52
I might back somebody up maybe as like a

3578.52 --> 3583.559
bait as a Bravo I might back somebody up

3581.52 --> 3585.9
going against Brandon but I am not going

3583.559 --> 3587.76
to be the number one face facing with

3585.9 --> 3590.2400000000002
Brenda I find

3587.76 --> 3591.8590000000004
her

3590.24 --> 3594.839
exorbitant

3591.859 --> 3598.68
exorbitant [ __ ]

3594.839 --> 3601.619
exorbently repulsive

3598.68 --> 3603.1189999999997
very very annoying and

3601.619 --> 3604.44
yeah

3603.119 --> 3606.2000000000003
just know

3604.44 --> 3609.26
not gonna do it

3606.2 --> 3609.2599999999998
[Music]

3609.359 --> 3614.839
and I'm gonna go up for

3610.92 --> 3614.839
against [ __ ] Sean Hawkins either

3615.299 --> 3618.599
it's pretty much most flat earthers I

3617.52 --> 3621.14
don't really want to go up against

3618.599 --> 3621.1400000000003
anyone

3621.18 --> 3626.64
maybe Simon Dan but I mean Simon then

3623.76 --> 3627.5400000000004
doesn't even do any live things so that

3626.64 --> 3629.52
would be

3627.54 --> 3633.619
impossible

3629.52 --> 3633.619
not going up against Mr sensible

3635.22 --> 3640.4399999999996
and besides Mr sensible would just turn

3638.22 --> 3643.0789999999997
it into a general conversation probably

3640.44 --> 3645.54
because none of them really have

3643.079 --> 3648.599
argumentations or they'll go straight to

3645.54 --> 3651.96
stupid math [ __ ]

3648.599 --> 3653.28
and I'm not good at that

3651.96 --> 3655.7400000000002
so

3653.28 --> 3658.3190000000004
like I'm good enough to know when like

3655.74 --> 3661.799
this is [ __ ] but I can't then show

3658.319 --> 3663.319
you the math why it's [ __ ] I can

3661.799 --> 3667.2599999999998
tell you

3663.319 --> 3671.0
descriptively so I don't I'm just not

3667.26 --> 3671.0
I'm not suited for any of that

3678.54 --> 3682.74
win that debate yeah but that's not how

3680.46 --> 3685.2
that works more color you don't win one

3682.74 --> 3688.0789999999997
debate with a word

3685.2 --> 3689.9399999999996
it's much more about endurance right a

3688.079 --> 3691.5
flat earther couldn't win like a hundred

3689.94 --> 3693.059
times in the debate

3691.5 --> 3695.76
but

3693.059 --> 3697.1400000000003
if the other person is just drawing more

3695.76 --> 3700.0200000000004
attention

3697.14 --> 3702.299
then nobody will see those wins except

3700.02 --> 3705.059
for the flat earthers that have enough

3702.299 --> 3707.52
eye to see it that if enough sharpness

3705.059 --> 3710.8190000000004
to see it but there's not yeah what's

3707.52 --> 3713.819
the point there's just no point

3710.819 --> 3713.819
foreign

3715.819 --> 3719.0
yeah sure

3730.68 --> 3735.1189999999997
why am I shooting my aliens what the

3732.66 --> 3736.5589999999997
[ __ ] are you whining about clammy what'd

3735.119 --> 3738.8
you get in here the first thing you do

3736.559 --> 3741.3590000000004
is start whining

3738.8 --> 3744.8590000000004
[Music]

3741.359 --> 3744.859
do you even like my show

3747.359 --> 3751.04
you're just complaining

3753.77 --> 3758.82
[Music]

3764.04 --> 3769.44
do you really like my show so much then

3766.799 --> 3770.94
why don't you just

3769.44 --> 3772.859
join

3770.94 --> 3775.26
the chat

3772.859 --> 3777.72
join what we're talking about

3775.26 --> 3779.76
Connie why do you have to be such a

3777.72 --> 3782.54
weird little awkward [ __ ]

3779.76 --> 3782.5400000000004
all the time

3783.059 --> 3786.059
foreign

3807.72 --> 3810.72
question

3816.4 --> 3819.59
[Music]

3826.14 --> 3831.48
really weird sometimes

3828.599 --> 3833.6400000000003
I wonder what is the point being like

3831.48 --> 3837.619
that being like what

3833.64 --> 3837.6189999999997
the [ __ ] are you whining about Yannick

3846.119 --> 3852.98
like what the [ __ ] are you whining about

3849.839 --> 3852.98
want to get kicked

3855.18 --> 3859.8799999999997
I was pretending to shoot when I joined

3857.7 --> 3859.8799999999997
yeah

3860.579 --> 3866.099
it was metaphorically you dumbass

3863.7 --> 3867.839
scatter gunning yeah we were talking

3866.099 --> 3870.599
about debating

3867.839 --> 3873.48
then I brought up scatter gunning and

3870.599 --> 3876.9
how I could scatter gun

3873.48 --> 3879.059
ball win arguments but it wouldn't be

3876.9 --> 3881.28
like a Tommy Gun

3879.059 --> 3884.4
but it would be like an Uzi which is

3881.28 --> 3888.2400000000002
like Infamous for being insanely

3884.4 --> 3892.859
an insane multitude of bullets spraying

3888.24 --> 3895.0789999999997
yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry this is all

3892.859 --> 3898.74
really difficult for you to just follow

3895.079 --> 3901.46
what the hell is going on on my show

3898.74 --> 3901.4599999999996
[ __ ] man

3903.96 --> 3908.299
like are you just [ __ ] clammy

3909.119 --> 3914.0
starting to think more that that's the

3911.819 --> 3914.0
case

3920.579 --> 3925.6400000000003
yeah I guess that does make you a [ __ ]

3922.859 --> 3925.64
Clary

3928.14 --> 3931.94
why did you ask that question

3934.26 --> 3939.2400000000002
wait don't you have the smarts to figure

3936.96 --> 3941.339
out that maybe

3939.24 --> 3944.5789999999997
I'm doing something metaphorically like

3941.339 --> 3947.22
do you have any critical thinking habit

3944.579 --> 3949.38
do you have internal monologue can you

3947.22 --> 3951.48
think inside your head about what's

3949.38 --> 3953.52
happening out there are you one of those

3951.48 --> 3955.92
people that just doesn't think always

3953.52 --> 3959.54
has to be told exactly what is going on

3955.92 --> 3959.54
or they can't follow what's happening

3962.88 --> 3967.28
you don't have the context when joining

3965.04 --> 3967.2799999999997
yeah

3967.38 --> 3971.46
yeah you know how you can attain the

3969.359 --> 3975.359
context

3971.46 --> 3981.02
you just shut up and you listen for like

3975.359 --> 3981.02
30 seconds to follow what's happening

3982.26 --> 3986.059
yeah you tune in

3995.42 --> 3999.78
or you could rewind for a minute I don't

3998.28 --> 4002.9
recommend doing that because then you

3999.78 --> 4006.38
fall behind but the point is is I'm so

4002.9 --> 4009.579
sick of this guy guys I mean

4006.38 --> 4009.579
what's wrong with it

4010.039 --> 4014.5
and is it me am I being so mean am I

4013.099 --> 4018.02
such a meanie

4014.5 --> 4020.119
let me seems like a nice person but why

4018.02 --> 4023.5
is he always so off

4020.119 --> 4023.5
it pisses me off

4041.78 --> 4046.42
yeah Rachel G that's that's the feeling

4043.76 --> 4046.42
that I get

4048.559 --> 4053.6600000000003
clammy out before in the past

4050.96 --> 4056.299
because of this awkwardness

4053.66 --> 4057.799
because back then I really didn't trust

4056.299 --> 4058.78
anybody and it just kicked him out

4057.799 --> 4061.0389999999998
immediately

4058.78 --> 4062.8390000000004
[Music]

4061.039 --> 4063.76
he's a troll

4062.839 --> 4064.94
what the [ __ ] man

4063.76 --> 4068.98
[Music]

4064.94 --> 4068.98
why did you just have a [ __ ] life

4073.579 --> 4077.78
such a big fan why did you just watch my

4076.28 --> 4081.1600000000003
show

4077.78 --> 4081.1600000000003
and leave me alone

4089.96 --> 4094.579
yeah

4091.52 --> 4097.64
good Clary

4094.579 --> 4100.4800000000005
just sit in the background and listen

4097.64 --> 4100.4800000000005
exactly

4114.859 --> 4119.299
because I don't know even if he's a

4116.839 --> 4123.759
troll or if he's just that weird

4119.299 --> 4123.759
and it just doesn't have any grip

4125.96 --> 4131.9800000000005
I mean this is like the fourth day in a

4128.179 --> 4131.9800000000005
row that you act like this

4132.38 --> 4135.9400000000005
it doesn't seem to go away

4136.58 --> 4140.66
and you seem to not really even take

4139.1 --> 4143.2390000000005
notice of that

4140.66 --> 4145.4
clammy so I think that you think that

4143.239 --> 4148.0
being like that is normal

4145.4 --> 4151.199
it isn't

4148.0 --> 4151.199
[Music]

4153.02 --> 4156.02
it what

4158.98 --> 4162.879999999999
who's Schrodinger's cat

4183.98 --> 4189.739
yeah Mark J yeah you got a good point

4186.02 --> 4192.02
and that that I noticed that

4189.739 --> 4193.8189999999995
especially yesterday why the [ __ ] would

4192.02 --> 4196.280000000001
you bring up that one thing that I'm not

4193.819 --> 4197.900000000001
even gonna repeat like why would you

4196.28 --> 4201.0199999999995
bring that up

4197.9 --> 4203.9
only the trolls do that like why would

4201.02 --> 4207.14
you even give a [ __ ] about any of that

4203.9 --> 4210.94
if you like my activities

4207.14 --> 4210.9400000000005
only trolls bring that up

4214.219 --> 4220.719
but I don't know I think that

4216.62 --> 4220.719
maybe he's just kind of [ __ ]

4222.14 --> 4226.820000000001
let me just lacks that level of

4224.239 --> 4230.199
sensibility maybe it's like whatever

4226.82 --> 4230.199
Autistic or something

4230.9 --> 4237.259999999999
maybe he's a troll by accident

4234.199 --> 4239.86
but I mean I'm gonna force you to become

4237.26 --> 4242.659000000001
aware of those

4239.86 --> 4245.36
incorrect behaviors

4242.659 --> 4248.179
and then you adapt

4245.36 --> 4250.54
because if you don't then I will take it

4248.179 --> 4250.54
as

4250.659 --> 4254.62
malignant refusal

4254.9 --> 4259.0
and that's unacceptable

4264.32 --> 4268.699
you're too quick to lump energy yeah

4266.3 --> 4271.06
Richard yeah but I mean I thought it was

4268.699 --> 4271.0599999999995
a troll

4271.76 --> 4275.96
but

4273.26 --> 4279.679
these days I kind of keep trolls around

4275.96 --> 4281.96
a little longer to like make them roll

4279.679 --> 4284.2390000000005
out their full pattern

4281.96 --> 4287.14
to really make sure whether they are

4284.239 --> 4287.139999999999
consciously a troll

4287.3 --> 4293.9800000000005
or just weird people because I also do

4290.48 --> 4293.98
attract weird people

4294.08 --> 4298.78
I mean I I am kind of weird in my own

4296.54 --> 4298.78
right

4299.719 --> 4305.0
right

4301.34 --> 4308.42
you probably know very very little other

4305.0 --> 4310.94
people out there let alone on the

4308.42 --> 4314.42
internet having a Daily Show

4310.94 --> 4317.419999999999
that are this focused and clear-minded

4314.42 --> 4320.3
but at the same time also display

4317.42 --> 4323.9
complete

4320.3 --> 4326.659000000001
Extreme Rage elaborate

4323.9 --> 4327.44
like that like that doesn't exist out

4326.659 --> 4330.0199999999995
there

4327.44 --> 4332.178999999999
and it probably kind of freaks out some

4330.02 --> 4335.900000000001
people

4332.179 --> 4338.06
because usually it's either one either

4335.9 --> 4341.0
they're just a raging Maniac always

4338.06 --> 4342.679
being frustrated and acting out not

4341.0 --> 4344.12
getting anywhere

4342.679 --> 4347.3
or

4344.12 --> 4349.58
really reserved really smart and then

4347.3 --> 4353.0
always holding and never showing it yeah

4349.58 --> 4355.94
yeah well guess what I am neither

4353.0 --> 4357.8
I am the paradoxical hybrid that you

4355.94 --> 4361.78
didn't think was possible well I am

4357.8 --> 4361.78
possible I am the living proof of it

4372.679 --> 4376.4800000000005
no

4373.64 --> 4376.4800000000005
okay

4379.66 --> 4388.7699999999995
[Music]

4411.739 --> 4414.58
anyhow

4416.3 --> 4419.96
what the hell have I actually been

4417.86 --> 4423.099999999999
talking about

4419.96 --> 4423.1
in this last hour

4428.96 --> 4435.64
started out with

4431.14 --> 4435.64
turrets Cricket show idea

4440.0 --> 4446.3
oh yeah then the debate oh can I go to

4443.96 --> 4448.6
the debate and why I don't want to do

4446.3 --> 4448.6
that

4449.06 --> 4455.179
four shows for 250 euros I mean dollars

4452.719 --> 4457.1
which we will be in less Euros yeah

4455.179 --> 4459.52
there's no [ __ ] way man it's just not

4457.1 --> 4459.52
worth it

4460.73 --> 4465.678999999999
[Music]

4462.98 --> 4468.799999999999
right what would I gain from it except

4465.679 --> 4470.54
beside the money like

4468.8 --> 4474.5

that's first of all

especially you moxie

4599.78 --> 4605.0
so I don't know

4602.179 --> 4607.82
I don't know if I do it because I am not

4605.0 --> 4610.28
really great at debating because of my

4610.28 --> 4615.199
have that

Oakley does

4618.38 --> 4623.42
I'd rather see him do it

4621.14 --> 4625.46
because I know Nathan will absolutely

4623.42 --> 4627.32
devastate the globe

right just because I'm good at

4644.42 --> 4648.86
explaining these things

4647.06 --> 4650.96
calmly

4648.86 --> 4653.38
on my show

4650.96 --> 4656.54
doesn't mean that I'm good when I'm

sharing my time

with an anti-flat earther

4659.06 --> 4662.719
it's not going to be the same thing

4660.44 --> 4666.94
they're going to be painting all over

4662.719 --> 4666.94
what I do disrupting my focus

4667.219 --> 4670.9
and it just gonna piss me off

4671.3 --> 4676.219
and then I'm gonna continually have to

4673.58 --> 4678.8
correct and break in correct it I don't

4676.219 --> 4681.679
want to do it guys I don't want to do it

4678.8 --> 4683.96
if I did it the guy

4681.679 --> 4686.42
from Modern Day debate would probably

4683.96 --> 4689.0
tell me to stop interrupting even though

4686.42 --> 4690.56
I'm literally trying to correct a

4689.0 --> 4693.5

4690.56 --> 4697.0
that's a I don't want to do it really

4693.5 --> 4697.0
I still don't want to do it

it I don't want to do it

4730.28 --> 4734.42
like even if I did it I would do it

4732.56 --> 4737.8
desperately for the money and not

4734.42 --> 4737.8
because I wanted to do it

there's not

it's a giant gamma hive

I mean pay attention

4888.56 --> 4893.659000000001
watch all these videos he's made and

4891.62 --> 4896.42
he's made a lot just just watch them for

4899.42 --> 4906.04
gets on that show then the gamma's pull

4902.78 --> 4910.34
them down to their level it happens

you're not one deck

4982.88 --> 4987.1990000000005
yeah

4984.159 --> 4989.299999999999
one deck doesn't bring up oh they were

4987.199 --> 4992.96
talking at Jam pandas

4989.3 --> 4996.62
yeah because dj1 deck doesn't do that

4992.96 --> 4997.88
he's not a a gamma spaz that hangs

4996.62 --> 5001.26
around with

4997.88 --> 5001.26
with swamp monsters

5030.46 --> 5036.78
the troll I don't know which the troll

5033.04 --> 5036.78
you're talking it could be yeah

5038.5 --> 5044.14
well do I don't even know the I mean

5042.1 --> 5046.900000000001
there is a couple it's not just one guy

5044.14 --> 5049.6
it's just if their soccer counts

5046.9 --> 5051.58
certainly appearing that's always going

5049.6 --> 5053.620000000001
to be one guy

5051.58 --> 5056.32
during that show doesn't mean there's

5053.62 --> 5057.699
only one person that ever does that okay

5056.32 --> 5059.32
it just means

5057.699 --> 5062.5
if there's going to be a troll soccer

5059.32 --> 5063.94
count keeping popping up that's one

5062.5 --> 5067.48
person

5063.94 --> 5069.699
in that specific instance

5067.48 --> 5072.159
doesn't mean there's only one troll that

5069.699 --> 5074.739
ever does that there's multiple

5072.159 --> 5076.12
but if it happens and you see like oh a

5074.739 --> 5079.919999999999
thousand trolls are over running the

5076.12 --> 5079.92
chat that's usually just one person

5083.08 --> 5085.08
um

5088.06 --> 5092.38
but there is one guy that particularly

5090.28 --> 5096.4
likes it like

5092.38 --> 5098.86
create simulacrums of people that we all

5096.4 --> 5100.42
know flat earthers and then like make a

5098.86 --> 5102.94
fake account of them then sort of

5100.42 --> 5104.92
pretend to be them

5102.94 --> 5108.239
there's one there's one troll that

5104.92 --> 5108.2390000000005
typically likes to do that yeah

5114.06 --> 5117.159000000001
[Music]

5119.52 --> 5125.92
there's not only one troll

5123.1 --> 5128.14

5125.92 --> 5132.159
that do have like

5128.14 --> 5134.320000000001
a thousand soccer cards

5132.159 --> 5137.08
I don't think they'd need any more

5134.32 --> 5139.179
though than that

5137.08 --> 5141.36
of course you could just reuse him every

5139.179 --> 5141.36
time

5157.78 --> 5162.04
it's been months yeah that's probably

5160.3 --> 5165.76
because you didn't

5162.04 --> 5167.98
actually read the comment section of my

5165.76 --> 5172.3
last stream

5167.98 --> 5174.5199999999995
in what is it in March or April

5172.3 --> 5177.34
where I clearly left a message like hey

5174.52 --> 5178.4800000000005
I'm on my backup

5177.34 --> 5180.9400000000005

5178.48 --> 5182.739
are we in there that's where I've been

5180.94 --> 5184.9
streaming for three months until I came

5182.739 --> 5188.08
back because my strikes

5184.9 --> 5191.28
the strike periods were all over

5188.08 --> 5191.28

5196.0 --> 5201.34

5215.32 --> 5220.0599999999995
the same

5217.0 --> 5223.06
did you see yesterday's show think that

5220.06 --> 5224.92
topic was about trolls did you see the

5223.06 --> 5228.3
show before yesterday you think the

5224.92 --> 5228.3
topic there was about trolls

5230.08 --> 5236.04

5372.219 --> 5376.179
across it again

5374.139 --> 5380.56
but you're talking about the guy that's

5376.179 --> 5383.62
that his subject was always about

5380.56 --> 5385.780000000001
about the law right about

5383.62 --> 5388.679
how to be

5385.78 --> 5388.679
uh

5390.159 --> 5393.42
about natural law

5393.76 --> 5398.159000000001
the real law damn it what is his name

5395.98 --> 5398.159
again

5398.44 --> 5401.739
um

5399.1 --> 5403.54
I am supposedly subscribed to him

5401.739 --> 5405.9
it could be his channel has been deleted

5403.54 --> 5405.9
or something

5423.82 --> 5426.42
oh yeah

5425.139 --> 5430.08
is

5426.42 --> 5430.08
that what you're talking about

5431.199 --> 5434.28
Flat Earth Court

5434.679 --> 5437.58
is this it

5438.639 --> 5442.1990000000005
yes there was a one right

5443.34 --> 5446.88
he's still out there

5451.08 --> 5456.88
he did come on like fed

5453.94 --> 5459.599999999999
like a few months ago in Discord for a

5456.88 --> 5459.6
bit that was fun

5460.179 --> 5463.62
I don't know what he's doing now

5465.34 --> 5469.179
yeah I did have like these nice reggae

5467.44 --> 5472.0199999999995
sessions

5469.179 --> 5472.02
on this channel

5477.94 --> 5483.219
yeah he is pretty he is smart

5480.82 --> 5486.699
he does have some weird spiritual

5483.219 --> 5489.04
opinions in ways though

5486.699 --> 5491.339999999999
he's not definitely not some Flawless

5489.04 --> 5491.34
guy

5494.26 --> 5499.360000000001
but I mean neither am I

5497.139 --> 5502.12
am I I do like him but I I think I get

5499.36 --> 5503.98
on his nerves a lot

5502.12 --> 5505.179
so I experienced because I'm so

5503.98 --> 5508.799999999999
talkative

5505.179 --> 5508.8
and it gets on his nerves I think

5512.739 --> 5518.08
but he's like he doesn't like hate me or

5515.92 --> 5519.219
anything but I do get him as nervous I

5518.08 --> 5521.76
think

5519.219 --> 5521.76
hmm

5524.62 --> 5530.32
I do think like he is a cool guy though

5527.679 --> 5533.6990000000005
in a way

5530.32 --> 5533.699
he is a first waiver

5541.3 --> 5546.04
I guarantee you do that to everyone

5544.719 --> 5548.139
really

5546.04 --> 5550.56
I don't know Marco you don't really seem

5548.139 --> 5550.56
that

5551.02 --> 5555.2390000000005
annoying in the chat

5575.8 --> 5581.08
you suck at typing

5577.96 --> 5583.12
you should do something about that

5581.08 --> 5587.199
like

5583.12 --> 5590.5599999999995
first off get an actual keyboard

5587.199 --> 5592.54
don't do it with the mobile like you're

5590.56 --> 5596.580000000001
if you do it on your mobile you're not

5592.54 --> 5596.58
gonna learn to type better and faster

5597.699 --> 5604.86
if you really want a speedy type

5601.3 --> 5604.860000000001
you've got to use a keyboard

5606.76 --> 5609.2390000000005
right

5609.699 --> 5614.678999999999
that's what the professionals do it's

5611.679 --> 5617.1
what the typewriter was before it became

5614.679 --> 5617.1
a computer

5622.06 --> 5625.06
what

5628.84 --> 5632.159000000001
the hell does that even mean

5637.36 --> 5642.48
oh you got hand problems okay nerve

5639.82 --> 5642.48
damage e

5648.659 --> 5655.599999999999
typing game oh okay so then I think I

5652.9 --> 5658.839999999999
probably played that before but I mean I

5655.6 --> 5662.8
am a lightning fast typer

5658.84 --> 5664.179
like I never look at my keyboard

5662.8 --> 5666.46
go barely

5664.179 --> 5668.1990000000005
well I do look at my keyboard but when

5666.46 --> 5670.659
I'm like like I want to say something

5668.199 --> 5672.94
now I don't know

5670.659 --> 5676.44
but I mean my keyboard kind of sucks

5672.94 --> 5676.44
because it's not new

5677.92 --> 5683.56
and so I have to like double check every

5680.8 --> 5688.1990000000005
time what I type

5683.56 --> 5688.1990000000005
but I am very fast

5696.88 --> 5700.32
keyboards are gay

5703.84 --> 5708.06
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

5705.52 --> 5708.06
talking about

5711.9 --> 5715.5599999999995
keyboards are not gay

5724.5 --> 5730.3
right unless you think your typewriters

5727.84 --> 5731.9800000000005
are gay if they think that typewriters

5730.3 --> 5737.04
are gay well then you probably think

5731.98 --> 5737.04
that just riding with pen and ink is gay

5737.44 --> 5740.759999999999
I think writing is gay

5742.0 --> 5744.9
I don't think so

5752.32 --> 5756.639
it depends though on what you're writing

5754.9 --> 5759.219
of course

5756.639 --> 5760.36
right so you can be very gay with a

5759.219 --> 5763.179
keyboard

5760.36 --> 5764.5
but you can also be very non-gay with

5763.179 --> 5770.159
the keyboard

5764.5 --> 5770.159
so keyboard is not a separate gay Factor

5771.76 --> 5777.52
writing for the yeah for the gay

5774.94 --> 5780.699
newspaper is gay yes that's right

5777.52 --> 5782.620000000001
but that doesn't make the writing or the

5780.699 --> 5785.5599999999995
device you're using to writing per

5782.62 --> 5788.38
default gay but yeah if you do the gay

5785.56 --> 5790.54
things with devices then yeah that does

5788.38 --> 5792.46
make them gay but it's more because

5790.54 --> 5794.08
you're doing gay things not because of

5792.46 --> 5796.679
the device

5794.08 --> 5802.78
right unless

5796.679 --> 5805.179
the device can only lead to gay results

5802.78 --> 5807.58
right that that was the argumentation

5805.179 --> 5811.3
yesterday with the glasses

5807.58 --> 5812.98
right because you can't use glasses in a

5811.3 --> 5816.58
non-gay way

5812.98 --> 5818.98
unless you're literally born with I

5816.58 --> 5821.92
bad eyesight

5818.98 --> 5823.718999999999
but the re why I said glasses were gay

5821.92 --> 5825.46
you should have paid attention that

5823.719 --> 5829.679
three and a half hour showed what every

5825.46 --> 5833.38
second of it why I said it's gay

5829.679 --> 5837.34
is because the reason why people start

5833.38 --> 5840.1
wearing it it's like oh no oh my eyes a

5837.34 --> 5842.56
little tired oh I quickly

5840.1 --> 5845.56
quickly or quickly do some surgery or

5842.56 --> 5847.780000000001
get a device quickly to correct it so I

5845.56 --> 5850.120000000001
can keep going in this unnatural

5847.78 --> 5853.48
Behavior that's causing these problems

5850.12 --> 5854.86
so that's exacerbate exacerbate those

5853.48 --> 5857.379999999999
problems

5854.86 --> 5858.88
by quickly correcting it so I can keep

5857.38 --> 5861.88
doing that thing that's causing the

5858.88 --> 5863.7390000000005
problems Yeah by wearing glasses and

5861.88 --> 5866.4400000000005
then needing them forever never being

5863.739 --> 5868.54
able to live without them again yeah

5866.44 --> 5872.678999999999
that's why they're gay

5868.54 --> 5875.8
because they always lead to a gay result

5872.679 --> 5877.12
a keyboard doesn't always lead to a gay

5875.8 --> 5882.0
result

5877.12 --> 5882.0
that's why it's not a default gay thing

5883.9 --> 5887.04
you get it

5897.4 --> 5903.299999999999
can Vision be corrected the way they

5900.28 --> 5903.3
correct a lazy eye

5903.52 --> 5908.219
isn't lazy eye like a surgery

5909.219 --> 5916.4800000000005
I mean the point is that no vision

5914.32 --> 5918.46
well you could probably correct it a

5916.48 --> 5921.04
little with that but that's not the

5918.46 --> 5923.679
point the point is is that by the time

5921.04 --> 5926.5
you get to that

5923.679 --> 5931.3
it's already too late you should have at

5926.5 --> 5933.94
first started like realizing yeah it's

5931.3 --> 5936.04
going to be more difficult to focus

5933.94 --> 5939.159
properly as you grow older

5936.04 --> 5943.12
don't over Tire your eyes

5939.159 --> 5945.699
don't keep reading stuff

5943.12 --> 5946.659
non-stop for hours straight looking at a

5945.699 --> 5949.178999999999
screen

5946.659 --> 5951.219
without a break without focusing on

5949.179 --> 5952.4800000000005
other things so that your eyes can

5951.219 --> 5954.88
suddenly

5952.48 --> 5957.94
let those muscles

5954.88 --> 5961.179
loose of it right you gotta learn I

5957.94 --> 5963.759999999999
discipline and I training

5961.179 --> 5967.96
and then you can be 43

5963.76 --> 5971.62
not wear glasses ever not one time in my

5967.96 --> 5973.54
life have I ever worn glasses

5971.62 --> 5974.5
other than to like oh what does that

5973.54 --> 5976.96
look like

5974.5 --> 5980.62
and that's it like three seconds and I

5976.96 --> 5984.52
immediately took them off right

5980.62 --> 5987.48
and now I'm 43 I don't wear glasses even

5984.52 --> 5989.7390000000005
though both my parents

5987.48 --> 5992.259999999999
wore glasses

5989.739 --> 5994.799999999999
after 40.

5992.26 --> 5994.8
you understand

5994.84 --> 5999.400000000001
I don't

5996.4 --> 6001.799999999999
I don't need them and I can still read

5999.4 --> 6003.12
without them

6001.8 --> 6005.88
why

6003.12 --> 6009.42
because I didn't over Tire my eyes it

6005.88 --> 6010.86
didn't like exploit myself

6009.42 --> 6014.1
like that

6010.86 --> 6017.159
and I've had careful training

6014.1 --> 6019.08
my parents confirmed we're gay yeah well

6017.159 --> 6020.5199999999995
they didn't know any better

6019.08 --> 6022.82
yeah they didn't have all that

6020.52 --> 6022.820000000001
information

6025.02 --> 6032.88
but my parents went through uh Organic

6029.4 --> 6034.379999999999
Revolution realization themselves I

6032.88 --> 6036.179
basically got it from them and then

6034.38 --> 6038.58
perfected it

6036.179 --> 6040.32
but yeah my parents do my parents were

6038.58 --> 6045.0599999999995
like hippies

6040.32 --> 6049.32
my parents were literally dope smoking

6045.06 --> 6052.38
flower throwing hippies okay give them a

6049.32 --> 6054.84
break dude yeah they were gay they

6052.38 --> 6057.0
rolled into the gate like everybody

6054.84 --> 6060.0
almost everybody in that generation that

6057.0 --> 6061.92
wasn't just a straight out like a jacket

6060.0 --> 6065.88
wearing Thai wearing jock or something

6061.92 --> 6068.659
okay sure they were kind of gay they

6065.88 --> 6068.659000000001
were very hippie

6069.179 --> 6075.139
but I mean my dad's grown out of that

6076.199 --> 6082.62
as far as you can grow out of that

6078.98 --> 6086.099999999999
[Music]

6082.62 --> 6090.38
and my mother kind of died so yeah God

6086.1 --> 6090.38
really grow out of that okay yeah

6091.02 --> 6098.4800000000005
but yeah they wear glasses

6093.6 --> 6098.4800000000005
but it's because they didn't know

6098.82 --> 6103.199
they told me yeah you all need glasses

6101.34 --> 6105.78
too when you get older

6103.199 --> 6108.5599999999995
and I literally back then as a teenager

6105.78 --> 6108.5599999999995
said no

6108.84 --> 6111.8
I will not

6113.219 --> 6118.52
out of nowhere back then I said no I

6116.28 --> 6123.3
will not I'm gonna like train my eyes

6118.52 --> 6125.52
it's because your your eyes get tired

6123.3 --> 6127.860000000001
which I already noticed back then

6125.52 --> 6129.900000000001
because I was a stupid little computer

6127.86 --> 6132.599999999999
boy that didn't have a social life it

6129.9 --> 6136.5599999999995
was like Yay yay Nintendo

6132.6 --> 6139.08
over to 64. yay Amiga 1200 stare at the

6136.56 --> 6141.780000000001
screen and play the game

6139.08 --> 6143.34
and yeah that's kind of gay

6141.78 --> 6145.82
Escapist

6143.34 --> 6145.82
whatever

6147.0 --> 6151.739
but I noticed like yeah when you do that

6149.94 --> 6152.699
all the time yeah your eyes get kind of

6151.739 --> 6156.9
tired

6152.699 --> 6161.28
well what can you do about it

6156.9 --> 6164.638999999999
you go outside you walk around and you

6161.28 --> 6167.699
stare at the grass at the trees at the

6164.639 --> 6170.46
clouds all these different

6167.699 --> 6173.28
all these different things with

6170.46 --> 6176.96
different distances to your eye and you

6173.28 --> 6180.0599999999995
give your eyes a break from

6176.96 --> 6181.92
staring at a dead thing at a dead set

6180.06 --> 6184.080000000001
distance and then always having to focus

6181.92 --> 6185.9400000000005
all the time yep you got to give your

6184.08 --> 6188.58
eyes a break and actually take that

6185.94 --> 6191.699
serious and keep track of those eye

6188.58 --> 6193.26
muscles how strained are they if you're

6191.699 --> 6195.119
going to over strain them you know what

6193.26 --> 6198.659000000001
eventually happens

6195.119 --> 6201.0599999999995
you start to pull those muscles yeah

6198.659 --> 6202.98
just like when you overdo it with

6201.06 --> 6206.400000000001
training or sport you can pull the

6202.98 --> 6208.08
muscles like yeah that [ __ ] can also

6206.4 --> 6211.099999999999
happen with your eye muscles it's kind

6208.08 --> 6211.1
of painful when it happens

6211.199 --> 6215.46
usually only happens when you're younger

6213.239 --> 6218.5199999999995
and you like overdo studying and [ __ ]

6215.46 --> 6221.699
I've seen it but

6218.52 --> 6223.4400000000005
if you have that and you ram your force

6221.699 --> 6225.0
yourself through it because I have to do

6223.44 --> 6226.98
it I have to do it even though he had

6225.0 --> 6229.139
something like that guess what happened

6226.98 --> 6232.259999999999
you're going to be needing glasses why

6229.139 --> 6233.52
because you literally wrecked your eye

6232.26 --> 6236.84
muscles

6233.52 --> 6236.84
you did it all wrong

6240.0 --> 6245.719
I bet Arwin will need why the [ __ ]

6242.46 --> 6245.719
you're saying that erotic

6249.6 --> 6254.639
I will need glasses within 10 years why

6252.239 --> 6257.879999999999
why would you think that

6254.639 --> 6260.88
I've been staring at computer screens a

6257.88 --> 6263.78
lot since I was six

6260.88 --> 6263.78
mrpo

6264.0 --> 6271.159
what's so different after

6267.08 --> 6274.76
37 years that I'm suddenly gonna need

6271.159 --> 6274.759999999999
glasses in 10 years

6277.56 --> 6280.669000000001
[Music]

6295.44 --> 6301.619
that's good it's true now well yeah I

6298.08 --> 6303.36
mean eventually when I get old enough

6301.619 --> 6305.159
everything will be more tiresome

6303.36 --> 6308.099999999999
probably or maybe I will become even

6305.159 --> 6310.138999999999
stronger but if I do become weaker with

6308.1 --> 6312.4800000000005
a lot of age

6310.139 --> 6314.34
yeah I probably end up wearing glasses

6312.48 --> 6315.0599999999995
and you can all laugh at me at how gay I

6314.34 --> 6317.219
am

6315.06 --> 6320.159000000001
because I'm so old

6317.219 --> 6321.659
that's fine it gives you [ __ ] by that

6320.159 --> 6324.0199999999995
time I'll be happy to get any sort of

6321.659 --> 6324.0199999999995
attention

6331.76 --> 6336.26
or I'll be way too busy to care

6341.46 --> 6343.639
foreign

6346.8 --> 6351.38
by that time I still talk about troll no

6353.159 --> 6358.46
there's a good chance that by the time I

6355.5 --> 6361.739
am really old if I outlive this crazy

6358.46 --> 6363.96
these crazy times and I probably will

6361.739 --> 6368.299999999999
there's a good chance that by the time I

6363.96 --> 6368.3
get old there will be no more trolls

6374.46 --> 6378.96
people will no longer engage in that

6376.86 --> 6380.639
sort of behavior

6378.96 --> 6381.84
because they don't feel they need to

6380.639 --> 6384.54
anymore

6381.84 --> 6386.34
because there's no more dark evil

6384.54 --> 6390.139
incentive to do that sort of thing

6386.34 --> 6394.139
there's no more market for bullies

6390.139 --> 6398.04
yeah there's so much trolls out there

6394.139 --> 6401.82
because there's a literal market for it

6398.04 --> 6405.48
this dark mega corporations funded by

6401.82 --> 6409.739
really [ __ ] evil anti-human bankers

6405.48 --> 6412.799999999999
that want people to throw others

6409.739 --> 6415.32
especially those that that go into No-No

6412.8 --> 6419.04
subjects they want that

6415.32 --> 6421.92
it's their psychological defense yeah

6419.04 --> 6423.239
their defense is attacking that which

6421.92 --> 6426.0
does not

6423.239 --> 6428.58
compart with their mind control program

6426.0 --> 6430.08
which Omega corporations rest on all

6428.58 --> 6432.54
their all rest on the mind control

6430.08 --> 6435.42
program Universal Mind control program

6432.54 --> 6439.08
something goes outside of it then they

6435.42 --> 6441.96
want you to troll them

6439.08 --> 6442.98
yeah there is incentive for trolls to

6441.96 --> 6446.219
exist

6442.98 --> 6448.5599999999995
people get money because they throw it's

6446.219 --> 6452.76
not like an official job or anything but

6448.56 --> 6455.159000000001
it does happen you bet your ass it does

6452.76 --> 6457.860000000001
especially especially when somebody just

6455.159 --> 6463.259999999999
suddenly gets overrun by by thousands of

6457.86 --> 6465.659
them that's paid operation I guarantee

6463.26 --> 6468.2390000000005
right a couple of trolls come rolling in

6465.659 --> 6470.28
and start reeking Havoc that's one thing

6468.239 --> 6473.638999999999
but when it's like massive like on a

6470.28 --> 6474.84
massive skill there's money involved

6473.639 --> 6478.32
right

6474.84 --> 6481.56
but if these [ __ ] up anti-human Mega

6478.32 --> 6484.86
corporations funded by their anti-human

6481.56 --> 6488.1
Eugenics Bankers if that stops yeah if

6484.86 --> 6490.259999999999
Black Card BlackRock Vanguard if that

6488.1 --> 6492.900000000001
stops

6490.26 --> 6497.42
if it breaks up if it's destroyed well

6492.9 --> 6497.42
then so will the incentive for trolling

6499.139 --> 6504.96
it will no longer be a squeeze it till

6502.44 --> 6507.96
you break it economy

6504.96 --> 6510.0
no more no more predatory economy

6507.96 --> 6511.9800000000005
economics

6510.0 --> 6514.26
if there's no more predatory economics

6511.98 --> 6515.28
like that like there is right now in the

6514.26 --> 6517.1990000000005
world

6515.28 --> 6519.78
in these last phases of the New World

6517.199 --> 6522.36
Order hoping for they hope that they're

6519.78 --> 6525.48
gonna Usher in a new phase

6522.36 --> 6527.4
of Neo feudalism but they probably won't

6525.48 --> 6530.339999999999
succeed

6527.4 --> 6533.4
when it's over and all these Mega

6530.34 --> 6535.4400000000005
corporations crumble then so will the

6533.4 --> 6537.299999999999
incentive for trolling

6535.44 --> 6540.36
and you will notice that there won't be

6537.3 --> 6542.88
as much trolling there won't be as many

6540.36 --> 6547.04
nasty ass people on the internet they

6542.88 --> 6547.04
will kind of like just wither

6547.5 --> 6552.119
and retract more into the caves I mean

6550.32 --> 6554.219
you'll still have your jam Panda type

6552.119 --> 6559.58
rooms everywhere

6554.219 --> 6559.58
but they will like be more hidden

6560.04 --> 6565.219
I mean Jam Panda service already pretty

6561.96 --> 6565.219
hidden by itself

6566.04 --> 6570.139
right that's where they will be

6578.84 --> 6585.42
anyway right man this show is already

6583.44 --> 6587.28
time has flown I hope you guys liked it

6585.42 --> 6589.6990000000005
ah what the hell am I gonna title this

6587.28 --> 6589.699
thing now

6593.82 --> 6597.259999999999
FTD today yes

6599.1 --> 6604.1990000000005
pretty sure yeah Nathan opened the panel

6601.26 --> 6605.820000000001
did not report any problems I guess I'm

6604.199 --> 6608.5199999999995
gonna round out I don't know what what

6605.82 --> 6610.199
to name this show though

6608.52 --> 6614.280000000001
maybe I'm just gonna leave it blank

6610.199 --> 6616.619
again but it was a fun show right guys

6614.28 --> 6618.42
fun enough

6616.619 --> 6621.599999999999
right

6618.42 --> 6623.88
and if that DJ one deck happened to be

6621.6 --> 6626.6990000000005
the real DJ one deck that was just in a

6623.88 --> 6628.5
very odd mood for his doing then I hope

6626.699 --> 6631.32
he'll tell me

6628.5 --> 6633.6
if he gets in Discord on fpd

6631.32 --> 6637.0199999999995
because I will unblock him then but it

6633.6 --> 6639.780000000001
just that was a really fresh account

6637.02 --> 6641.52
from may this may that didn't make any

6639.78 --> 6643.5
sense to me and he didn't really talk

6641.52 --> 6646.56
like DJ one that

6643.5 --> 6648.42
from what I've experienced so but if I

6646.56 --> 6651.8
was wrong then I hope to hear back from

6648.42 --> 6651.8
him and I'll block him again

6660.179 --> 6666.92
test your typing skills

6663.48 --> 6666.919999999999
yeah maybe

6668.699 --> 6673.0199999999995
yeah I don't know it was all over the

6671.46 --> 6675.9800000000005
place that you could say test your

6673.02 --> 6675.9800000000005
typing skills

6677.119 --> 6681.86
I could say turrets cricket

6682.26 --> 6685.219
show

6686.699 --> 6691.739
but it's all like these subjects that

6688.86 --> 6693.239
are like kind of weird for a title I did

6691.739 --> 6695.218999999999
enjoy the show though with you guys

6693.239 --> 6697.138999999999
there was a lot of energy the chat was

6695.219 --> 6699.26
great

6697.139 --> 6702.359
but I don't know

6699.26 --> 6702.359
[Music]

6702.36 --> 6708.239
what type in your

6706.02 --> 6711.7390000000005
shifter

6708.239 --> 6711.739
what the [ __ ] a shifter

6718.08 --> 6724.0199999999995
menu later no I'm not gonna call it the

6720.42 --> 6727.26
many layers of gay more colored

6724.02 --> 6729.8
think about that that's not the good

6727.26 --> 6729.8
title

6731.28 --> 6737.9
I mean I literally might get it an adult

6734.34 --> 6737.900000000001
tag if I do that

6744.179 --> 6747.9800000000005
are hearing aids gay it will

6751.56 --> 6754.88
technically yes

6754.98 --> 6759.0
but it's a very understandable mistake

6757.32 --> 6762.42
to make but there are actually

6759.0 --> 6766.52
apparently techniques that really

6762.42 --> 6766.52
prevent hearing decline

6767.4 --> 6771.739
there's some really interesting tricks

6769.38 --> 6771.7390000000005
out there

6772.44 --> 6775.94
but yeah hearing aids

6776.28 --> 6782.94
it's more understandable than glasses if

6779.76 --> 6787.46
you have those but it's still it it does

6782.94 --> 6787.46
have a fraction of gay to it yes

6788.58 --> 6791.179
okay

6793.44 --> 6797.638999999999
only if you listen to gay things well

6796.139 --> 6799.26
that's separate if you listen to gay

6797.639 --> 6800.6990000000005
things that's just gay that doesn't have

6799.26 --> 6803.46
anything to do with

6800.699 --> 6805.44
hearing aids but if you insist on

6803.46 --> 6807.9
getting your hearing aids because you

6805.44 --> 6810.36
want to hear your grandson talk about

6807.9 --> 6812.94
his pronouns

6810.36 --> 6815.42
that is kind of gay

6812.94 --> 6815.419999999999
see

6821.88 --> 6828.0
what is meant by gay anyway yeah that's

6825.48 --> 6830.339999999999
we'll talk about that some other time

6828.0 --> 6832.56
I'm gonna definitely run out now so

6830.34 --> 6834.4800000000005
