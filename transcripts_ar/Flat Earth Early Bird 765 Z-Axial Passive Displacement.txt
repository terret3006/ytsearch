162.239 --> 168.239
right uh

165.68 --> 171.84
yeah yesterday it's a pretty good show i

168.239 --> 171.84
didn't watch it back though

172.08 --> 176.31900000000002
and the flat earth debates was also good

176.959 --> 182.48
uh let's see

180.879 --> 185.84
i think it was pretty much there the

182.48 --> 185.84
whole time

189.14 --> 192.26
[Music]

192.319 --> 195.76
yeah i did check out did oh yeah yeah

194.48 --> 198.56
that's right i

195.76 --> 200.48
almost forgot i watched that movie

198.56 --> 203.68
somebody suggested in chat

200.48 --> 206.39999999999998
it was on youtube

203.68 --> 208.72
and that turned out to be pretty

206.4 --> 211.28
impressive

208.72 --> 213.84
it's again children who chase lost

211.28 --> 213.84
voices

214.159 --> 221.28
an anime movie and it was me

218.4 --> 222.64000000000001
was that you jarrett that recommended

221.28 --> 227.2
that

222.64 --> 231.27999999999997
it's a really it was fascinating

227.2 --> 231.28
it was basically yeah

234.48 --> 238.23899999999998
yeah it was what i thought it was it was

236.64 --> 241.439
based on the hollow earth

238.239 --> 242.08
conception and it's it's interesting

241.439 --> 244.959
that

242.08 --> 244.959
that exists

246.239 --> 250.879
and there was still plenty of uh yeah

248.439 --> 254.72
heliocentrism talk well plenty there was

250.879 --> 257.759
enough of it but

254.72 --> 262.079
when it came to the actual visuals

257.759 --> 265.12
yeah they yeah it was just like

262.079 --> 265.44
doors into another world practically and

265.12 --> 268.479
they

265.44 --> 270.96
yeah they really did show elements of it

268.479 --> 273.59999999999997
like oh there's no stars in there and

270.96 --> 275.12
but it was really elaborate and yeah

273.6 --> 278.40000000000003
magical and

275.12 --> 279.6
basically presented its own origin story

278.4 --> 283.59999999999997
for the world and

279.6 --> 287.84000000000003
what the argothans are like and

283.6 --> 287.84000000000003
yeah very detailed in its own way

288.16 --> 291.84000000000003
it's really made me think

292.16 --> 297.84000000000003
i thought it was a pretty good movie

299.36 --> 302.08000000000004
good to see you

302.72 --> 310.24
yeah yeah flatters debate

306.56 --> 310.72
after show chat yesterday very typical

310.24 --> 314.08
there

310.72 --> 318.72
there are some figures in in there some

314.08 --> 318.71999999999997
sort of baller troll types

318.88 --> 323.12
that just keep on scatter gunning it's

321.039 --> 325.199
unbelievable

323.12 --> 326.24
like i was paying attention there and

325.199 --> 329.68
that

326.24 --> 333.44
one guy was just tirelessly

329.68 --> 335.84000000000003
scatter gunning gaslighting

333.44 --> 339.6
like four different people in chat at

335.84 --> 341.84
the same time and really

339.6 --> 344.24
tight like he was constantly responding

341.84 --> 347.19899999999996
to four different people's arguments and

344.24 --> 349.039
with all the having red herrings and

347.199 --> 352.40000000000003
distraction tactics applied

349.039 --> 356.96
to each one it's just what the hell

352.4 --> 359.919
is that like that baller knew how to

356.96 --> 361.919
basically red herring and gaslight and

359.919 --> 364.639
straw men

361.919 --> 366.4
and lose at the same time of course

364.639 --> 369.6
because it doesn't make any argument

366.4 --> 372.0
really with four different people at the

369.6 --> 375.68
same time

372.0 --> 378.479
not exponential monk it wasn't him

375.68 --> 378.479
what's the other guy

379.28 --> 386.23999999999995
the truth police i sort of banned him

382.56 --> 386.24
and then eventually unbanned him

386.639 --> 390.56
because he just wouldn't stop like he

389.919 --> 392.639
was

390.56 --> 394.0
he was well he was having a conversation

392.639 --> 396.0
but he was effectively

394.0 --> 397.35
just spamming the chat and driving

396.0 --> 400.399
everybody nuts

397.35 --> 400.399
[Music]

403.36 --> 407.28000000000003
stopped debating people in chat for over

406.319 --> 410.40000000000003
a year now

407.28 --> 410.4
it's pointless yeah

411.759 --> 418.40000000000003
it is kind of pointless

414.96 --> 421.52
but there's still you can still just

418.4 --> 423.28
answer their question yeah you can't you

421.52 --> 425.12
can't answer their questions and you can

423.28 --> 427.11999999999995
answer it really well you just can't

425.12 --> 430.88
make them listen

427.12 --> 432.24
or at least give recognition to that

430.88 --> 436.0
they heard what you said

432.24 --> 439.12
in the moment but i've noticed also that

436.0 --> 439.919
even in those types of setup it it may

439.12 --> 442.8
still work

439.919 --> 443.68
like i see it like this they'll take the

442.8 --> 446.0
information

443.68 --> 447.28000000000003
or even almost by accident in their

446.0 --> 450.08
process if you say

447.28 --> 452.23999999999995
really well and concise and just

450.08 --> 454.24
actually answer the question on the

452.24 --> 456.88
level deeper than they realize

454.24 --> 456.88
themselves

456.96 --> 460.08
and then yeah they're not gonna

458.24 --> 460.96000000000004
recognize like you answered their

460.08 --> 464.08
question most

460.96 --> 466.87899999999996
most of the time but they're still

464.08 --> 468.96
going to take it that way and that's

466.879 --> 471.03900000000004
what i kind of try to do

468.96 --> 473.68
so i don't really debate them but i do

471.039 --> 473.68
answer them

475.68 --> 479.44
it's just that when they go nagging like

477.52 --> 480.87899999999996
oh why did you do this why did you do

479.44 --> 484.56
that to present all

480.879 --> 486.96000000000004
or show me every detail just like that

484.56 --> 489.28000000000003
in chat it's not even possible all that

486.96 --> 492.4
sort of nonsense yeah i don't

489.28 --> 494.31899999999996
respond to that anymore

492.4 --> 498.23999999999995
it's just literally them trying to make

494.319 --> 498.24
us waste our own time

499.36 --> 507.28000000000003
anyway uh yeah i got green tea with me

503.68 --> 508.96
and a cross on just a regular

507.28 --> 511.919
actual castle

508.96 --> 520.47
[Music]

511.919 --> 523.629
my breakfast

520.47 --> 523.629
[Music]

528.02 --> 532.1
[Music]

533.2 --> 549.839
hey here we go again good morning

550.16 --> 555.1999999999999
the chocolate filled croissants nah

552.16 --> 555.1999999999999
that's not my thing but

560.64 --> 566.399
i like i i don't even really eat

564.16 --> 568.88
chocolate anymore these days

566.399 --> 569.6
i used to eat a lot of chocolate i was

568.88 --> 574.88
really kind of

569.6 --> 574.88
addicted to it but not anymore

574.959 --> 578.88
although i did have like a self-made

577.6 --> 581.6
chocolate milk

578.88 --> 582.08
i do that now sometimes and i don't use

581.6 --> 585.839
milk

582.08 --> 589.519
i just use cacao regular

585.839 --> 593.2
sugar organical of course and

589.519 --> 593.839
the rice coconut milk and then i blend

593.2 --> 596.6400000000001
it

593.839 --> 598.0
in yeah so then i have chocolate milk

596.64 --> 601.04
without the actual milk

598.0 --> 605.839
but it's just as nice

601.04 --> 605.8389999999999
i do take that every now and then

605.92 --> 623.76
and that's about it concerning chocolate

619.76 --> 627.519
because yeah cacao taken in

623.76 --> 629.36
moderations is it does have kind of

627.519 --> 631.68
health benefits

629.36 --> 632.64
that's what i learned a long time ago if

631.68 --> 636.079
you eat the

632.64 --> 639.1999999999999
raw chocolate type things yeah

636.079 --> 642.16
that also is even better

639.2 --> 647.2
now cacao is not raw as far as i know

642.16 --> 649.76
it's still processed

647.2 --> 650.48
but yeah it feels good every time i take

649.76 --> 653.8389999999999
that

650.48 --> 654.75
as long as i don't take it too regularly

653.839 --> 657.519
huh

654.75 --> 661.2
[Music]

657.519 --> 663.92

661.2 --> 663.9200000000001
like orange

667.04 --> 672.88

691.6 --> 703.839

704.56 --> 706.88
what

712.98 --> 716.0
[Music]

714.839 --> 719.9200000000001
where

716.0 --> 723.44
substitute for chocolate huh

719.92 --> 723.4399999999999
wow that is weird

724.079 --> 731.8389999999999
i've never heard of that before but

726.48 --> 731.839
apparently it's a thing

735.68 --> 745.8389999999999
serotonin silica

747.12 --> 750.72
mediterranean middle east

754.32 --> 760.639
wow just goes to show there is so much

758.079 --> 760.6389999999999
out there i

762.399 --> 773.839
never heard of that before interesting

784.0 --> 787.44
i'll i'll try to look out for that when

786.16 --> 789.279
next time i go to the

787.44 --> 792.24
organic supermarket if they have

789.279 --> 792.24
anything like that

796.24 --> 803.519
but i've never literally never seen that

799.6 --> 803.519
name before so it could be there isn't

810.04 --> 815.8389999999999
[Music]

812.839 --> 815.839
any

817.04 --> 820.399
let's see what i've been doing

826.079 --> 831.12
uh yeah well yesterday i've been

827.92 --> 843.8389999999999
watching where babylon five

831.12 --> 843.839
sort of halfway season five now

847.68 --> 850.8
anything else uh no i don't think so i

850.32 --> 853.519
don't

850.8 --> 855.3599999999999
i was there maybe there was an own

853.519 --> 859.68
benjamin

855.36 --> 864.399
but if there was i forgot to make a note

859.68 --> 864.399
not too sure now i think it probably was

869.68 --> 873.3599999999999
write it i think there was

871.7 --> 875.839
[Music]

873.36 --> 876.399
because i remember like him presenting

875.839 --> 880.24
it

876.399 --> 883.44
like was it a tweet

880.24 --> 886.48
from somebody called ira who was just

883.44 --> 889.7600000000001
trying to

886.48 --> 895.279
go out grocery shopping and then was

889.76 --> 899.04
complaining about anti-mask people

895.279 --> 902.0
so that was kind of funny

899.04 --> 902.88
what's that what was the film that it

902.0 --> 905.36
was the film

902.88 --> 906.16
recommended to me yesterday here we go

905.36 --> 909.36
again

906.16 --> 909.36
by territ by the way

910.8 --> 914.079
i posted a link about it with the yeah

913.519 --> 918.079
in

914.079 --> 918.079
the flat earth early word chat

918.16 --> 922.88
it's called children who chase lost

920.399 --> 927.839
voices

922.88 --> 927.8389999999999
an anime movie

931.759 --> 940.0790000000001
but it was really it was really good

934.959 --> 944.16
and also it was also very anime though

940.079 --> 947.68
but it was just interesting because

944.16 --> 950.0
it had so much like they

947.68 --> 951.279
they tried to like halfway be really

950.0 --> 954.8
historical about

951.279 --> 957.759
things so yeah at some point dr

954.8 --> 958.9499999999999
garth gotham's i don't even know how to

957.759 --> 960.16
say that

958.95 --> 962.399
[Music]

960.16 --> 964.0
so somebody basically starts explaining

962.399 --> 969.04
to

964.0 --> 972.079
an outsider a top sider as they call it

969.04 --> 975.279
uh yeah

972.079 --> 976.959
how why what the situation has been for

975.279 --> 978.079
a long time and that every time they

976.959 --> 981.5999999999999
just try to

978.079 --> 985.12
remain peaceful and then some outsider

981.6 --> 988.0790000000001
opens the gate or comes through again

985.12 --> 991.12
and starts like getting meddlesome and

988.079 --> 993.279
trying to conquer things

991.12 --> 994.24
like and then they show basically

993.279 --> 997.279
historical

994.24 --> 1000.0790000000001
lineup of different

997.279 --> 1000.959
groups that have done that and like even

1000.079 --> 1004.7199999999999
hitler was

1000.959 --> 1006.959
in there so it it already plays into

1004.72 --> 1008.9590000000001
that

1006.959 --> 1012.3199999999999
that myth i guess you could call it or

1008.959 --> 1014.16
maybe there really is something to it

1012.32 --> 1018.0
like the whole yeah the movie really

1014.16 --> 1021.759
played into the the hollow earth concept

1018.0 --> 1021.759
it was yeah quite impressive

1022.56 --> 1025.839
akira or nothing

1033.28 --> 1037.039
now the movie was no akira but it was it

1036.319 --> 1041.039
was still

1037.039 --> 1044.48
pretty good and it's just

1041.039 --> 1045.839
very beautiful artwork too there was a

1044.48 --> 1049.3600000000001
lot of landscape

1045.839 --> 1051.2
art with just a lot of attention paid to

1049.36 --> 1055.4399999999998
it and some

1051.2 --> 1060.0800000000002
really fascinating sort of

1055.44 --> 1063.039
creative uh

1060.08 --> 1064.48
monolithic structures and things and

1063.039 --> 1068.559
just the design

1064.48 --> 1069.44
of the place really interesting to look

1068.559 --> 1073.039
at

1069.44 --> 1073.039
so hey if you like

1073.36 --> 1077.84
like martin luther's hangouts because of

1075.919 --> 1080.72
the photographs and [ __ ]

1077.84 --> 1081.76
well guess what this movie has some

1080.72 --> 1083.84
really

1081.76 --> 1085.52
interesting visuals that they put in

1083.84 --> 1089.52
there

1085.52 --> 1089.52
that is just very fascinating

1092.08 --> 1096.3999999999999
so yeah i do kind of recommend it

1097.52 --> 1102.24
or basically i do recommend i thought it

1099.36 --> 1106.1599999999999
was a really interesting movie

1102.24 --> 1122.77
hey mind the god yeah

1106.16 --> 1125.88
happy 2021 indeed thank you

1122.77 --> 1125.8799999999999
[Music]

1127.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
so what have you all been up to this

1130.24 --> 1137.84
friday night

1138.96 --> 1143.28
ninety percent of rotten tomatoes is

1140.799 --> 1143.28
that good

1144.16 --> 1151.8400000000001
hello iron xxvi

1153.57 --> 1156.619
[Music]

1162.84 --> 1165.84
26.

1188.45 --> 1193.44
[Music]

1190.84 --> 1196.9099999999999
hmm

1193.44 --> 1196.91
[Music]

1204.559 --> 1209.52
the return of christ wow okay

1209.679 --> 1221.8400000000001
oh i think you can wait

1213.84 --> 1221.84
a long time for that

1228.32 --> 1232.8799999999999
i don't know if there's going to be any

1230.48 --> 1236.4
kind of overt

1232.88 --> 1236.4
christ returned like that

1236.559 --> 1240.48
but i do think there is through humanity

1239.52 --> 1243.36
itself

1240.48 --> 1245.76
through us there is like a spirit

1243.36 --> 1251.52
revival a recognition of

1245.76 --> 1255.919
the path in the heat of his words

1251.52 --> 1255.9189999999999
and yeah at least that's what i'm doing

1258.72 --> 1262.0
so yeah i'm not i'm trying not to await

1261.679 --> 1264.3200000000002
any

1262.0 --> 1265.84
christ's return i'm just trying to

1264.32 --> 1269.52
follow example

1265.84 --> 1273.039
in my own way as well as i can

1269.52 --> 1275.6
and learning the process and then

1273.039 --> 1277.44
hopefully some others will sort of try

1275.6 --> 1281.52
it in their own way as well

1277.44 --> 1281.52
i think already quite a few people are

1285.32 --> 1288.3799999999999
[Music]

1288.48 --> 1291.84
jesus comes daily

1293.52 --> 1305.84
if you think that is what jesus is

1306.159 --> 1310.96
i'm not going to be as exoteric like

1308.72 --> 1310.96
that

1311.12 --> 1317.28
the new wakey upload is good oh does he

1314.08 --> 1319.52
did he make a new channel

1317.28 --> 1320.96
i haven't i didn't know that here we go

1319.52 --> 1323.76
again

1320.96 --> 1323.76
we have a link

1324.799 --> 1333.84
to his to his new channel

1339.49 --> 1343.72
[Music]

1357.35 --> 1361.109
[Music]

1372.84 --> 1379.36
right

1374.799 --> 1383.6
let's see yeah so

1379.36 --> 1383.6
ebola earth is absolutely finished but

1385.59 --> 1391.28
[Music]

1387.28 --> 1394.24
maybe argument wise but the belief

1391.28 --> 1394.24
still persists

1394.48 --> 1398.32
i'm not sure we can ever fully get rid

1397.039 --> 1401.84
of that

1398.32 --> 1402.32
in the entire world because it's not

1401.84 --> 1404.9599999999998
really

1402.32 --> 1404.96
our choice

1405.76 --> 1416.4
ah whoa that's a

1409.6 --> 1420.9599999999998
big link

1416.4 --> 1420.96
hey what is that that's not a youtube

1424.88 --> 1427.679
odyssey

1428.64 --> 1431.8400000000001
never heard of that

1440.4 --> 1448.0
huh looks like he has a hole

1444.88 --> 1450.0
whole bunch of videos up there so

1448.0 --> 1452.4
this is like another thing that he also

1450.0 --> 1455.2
uploaded his videos on

1452.4 --> 1455.44
odyssey never heard of it oh they have

1455.2 --> 1458.72
an

1455.44 --> 1462.96
astronaut sort of as a figurehead

1458.72 --> 1462.96
just very telling

1466.08 --> 1469.52
ah and library okay

1471.36 --> 1474.3999999999999
i've never heard of this odyssey before

1473.44 --> 1487.8400000000001
i'll check it out

1474.4 --> 1487.8400000000001
what it's like

1489.679 --> 1497.76
i describe it as a unit

1493.039 --> 1500.32
vector in a down direction what

1497.76 --> 1500.32
oh yeah

1500.88 --> 1509.1200000000001
iron 26 is there a z-axis bias

1506.799 --> 1509.12
yes

1509.84 --> 1514.3999999999999
now the issue though is with the the use

1512.24 --> 1516.64
of the very words itself

1514.4 --> 1518.0
when people say there is an absolute up

1516.64 --> 1522.159
or down that's

1518.0 --> 1525.039
yeah like colloquially

1522.159 --> 1526.8400000000001
yeah sure you could say that when it

1525.039 --> 1529.44
comes to

1526.84 --> 1532.9599999999998
physics no because

1529.44 --> 1536.48
those terminologies are relative

1532.96 --> 1538.08
that's the issue so that's why i

1536.48 --> 1541.039
basically try to avoid

1538.08 --> 1542.559
describing directions as absolute and

1541.039 --> 1547.12
would rather see it as a

1542.559 --> 1549.36
z-axis in a euclidean sense because i do

1547.12 --> 1551.1999999999998
think that the z-axis is extremely

1549.36 --> 1554.24
consistent

1551.2 --> 1557.2
or basically perfectly consistent

1554.24 --> 1559.44
relative density displacement no matter

1557.2 --> 1561.6000000000001
where it is the axis will always be

1559.44 --> 1564.0
parallel of the motion if there is

1561.6 --> 1564.0
motion

1564.32 --> 1571.84
so that is more or less my statement

1572.0 --> 1575.679
yeah and if i i started this some time

1574.96 --> 1577.8400000000001
ago

1575.679 --> 1578.72
didn't really catch on so far but i'm

1577.84 --> 1582.08
i'm

1578.72 --> 1584.159
thinking of calling relative density

1582.08 --> 1587.36
this equilibrium displacement

1584.159 --> 1587.3600000000001
passive displacement

1588.24 --> 1594.32
because yeah the matter

1591.36 --> 1595.1999999999998
does that all by itself without any

1594.32 --> 1598.559
intervention

1595.2 --> 1602.24
including the yeah if

1598.559 --> 1604.3999999999999
a dense object is

1602.24 --> 1605.36
laying on something else that obstructs

1604.4 --> 1608.0800000000002
it and

1605.36 --> 1610.84
still surrounded by air it's going to be

1608.08 --> 1613.76
pressing like what is recognized as

1610.84 --> 1614.72
weight but this still happens because

1613.76 --> 1617.76
it's not at

1614.72 --> 1620.159
equilibrium with its surrounding

1617.76 --> 1621.36
so that's why i call it passive

1620.159 --> 1624.88
displacement because

1621.36 --> 1628.32
it happens without any direct

1624.88 --> 1631.3600000000001
intervention from any anything

1628.32 --> 1632.96
it has to get there perhaps but that

1631.36 --> 1634.7199999999998
is another argument that is like an

1632.96 --> 1637.76
origin argument

1634.72 --> 1639.44
i'm not disputing the origin i'm just

1637.76 --> 1642.799
saying i'm trying to classify

1639.44 --> 1644.0
relative density displacement as passive

1642.799 --> 1646.32
displacement

1644.0 --> 1647.279
because all other kinds of displacement

1646.32 --> 1650.32
always have

1647.279 --> 1653.44
can be or are

1650.32 --> 1656.08
traced to specific actions and energy

1653.44 --> 1658.88
insertions and all kinds of things

1656.08 --> 1658.8799999999999
influences

1664.399 --> 1670.399
so anyway yeah i hope that kind of makes

1666.399 --> 1670.399
sense and we'll see where it goes

1670.799 --> 1674.6399999999999
or if it's even considered relevant

1675.65 --> 1678.759
[Music]

1681.52 --> 1686.8799999999999
anyway yeah z axial passive displacement

1687.36 --> 1691.76
it's kind of the classification for

1689.279 --> 1695.039
relative density this equilibrium

1691.76 --> 1698.8799999999999
displacement or at least the force the

1695.039 --> 1698.8799999999999
the influences of that force

1698.96 --> 1711.8400000000001
which can either be well displacement or

1701.36 --> 1711.84
just pressure

1722.84 --> 1725.84
hmm

1727.32 --> 1730.47
[Music]

1733.2 --> 1742.72
yep iron 26 oh that makes sense

1739.52 --> 1745.52
because the z-axis specifically

1742.72 --> 1748.88
points at both directions it's a line

1745.52 --> 1748.8799999999999
it's not just a direction

1751.36 --> 1754.24
it's an axis

1754.88 --> 1760.0800000000002
yeah because all this downward bias it's

1758.24 --> 1764.08
just getting really tiresome

1760.08 --> 1764.08
and unnecessary and confusing and

1764.84 --> 1773.52
old it's an old idea and

1770.64 --> 1781.1000000000001
it should be discarded because it is

1773.52 --> 1784.22
just outdated

1781.1 --> 1784.2199999999998
[Music]

1804.559 --> 1809.84
anybody else out there

1834.84 --> 1841.6789999999999
hmm

1837.039 --> 1844.799
all of america is severely hungover what

1841.679 --> 1844.799
why are you saying that

1846.48 --> 1855.84
ah a secret asian man good to see you

1850.72 --> 1855.84
i thought so yeah koala

1861.77 --> 1866.1589999999999
[Music]

1863.36 --> 1868.8799999999999
it's kind of a weird chemistry going in

1866.159 --> 1872.0800000000002
my own show sometimes because

1868.88 --> 1872.5590000000002
i think that i do people watching my

1872.08 --> 1875.76
show

1872.559 --> 1876.6399999999999
relax a lot now the problem from my side

1875.76 --> 1881.519
is

1876.64 --> 1885.1200000000001
is that i'm wondering like okay i'm not

1881.519 --> 1887.36
rambling on getting intense or

1885.12 --> 1889.5189999999998
very specific about a subject so does

1887.36 --> 1892.24
that mean it's getting boring

1889.519 --> 1893.84
and people are just vaguely listening in

1892.24 --> 1895.36
the background and kind of doing

1893.84 --> 1898.1589999999999
something else

1895.36 --> 1900.4799999999998
or are they just really actually

1898.159 --> 1904.96
enjoying

1900.48 --> 1904.96
the the calm pace

1905.12 --> 1908.1589999999999
that's a bit of an issue because

1906.72 --> 1910.08
sometimes it's like hey why

1908.159 --> 1912.0
isn't there more conversation why aren't

1910.08 --> 1914.399
you more

1912.0 --> 1915.76
forward or whatever like i hope i'm not

1914.399 --> 1917.5189999999998
getting boring

1915.76 --> 1920.48
but then at the same time yeah it could

1917.519 --> 1924.0
be that

1920.48 --> 1926.159
people actually like it that way this is

1924.0 --> 1926.159
just

1927.279 --> 1932.08
it can be a bit confusing from my side

1932.559 --> 1935.84
uh no

1947.679 --> 1953.279
no my god you're not going to be my next

1950.559 --> 1953.279
good servant

1953.519 --> 1958.0
i'm not going to do that anymore like he

1956.24 --> 1963.2
did that

1958.0 --> 1965.76
it's uncanny to me

1963.2 --> 1967.8400000000001
how much it feels alike what you're

1965.76 --> 1970.399
doing now

1967.84 --> 1972.399
and yes i do kind of appreciate that

1970.399 --> 1976.4799999999998
you're being nice at least

1972.399 --> 1979.1999999999998
right but i've already had

1976.48 --> 1981.84
somebody that did that was extremely

1979.2 --> 1984.72
helpful and defending me everywhere and

1981.84 --> 1988.0
spreading the links constantly

1984.72 --> 1992.08
but it was pushy and he

1988.0 --> 1995.2
wanted to be like he wanted

1992.08 --> 1997.84
also to be with me he wanted to be a

1995.2 --> 2000.64
co-host that's what he wanted

1997.84 --> 2002.72
right and the weird thing is i'm getting

2000.64 --> 2003.679
sort of a similar feeling from you a

2002.72 --> 2005.76
little

2003.679 --> 2007.6000000000001
you're you're being a little bit pushy

2005.76 --> 2009.279
you want to be part of the show you want

2007.6 --> 2011.36
to have a

2009.279 --> 2015.12
you want to have a bit of that spotlight

2011.36 --> 2015.12
well i don't really feel like that

2016.88 --> 2020.7990000000002
there's been issues in the past and as i

2020.159 --> 2022.64
said before

2020.799 --> 2024.72
that those aren't just forgotten like

2022.64 --> 2027.76
that i'm not

2024.72 --> 2033.84
going to hurry up and get another good

2027.76 --> 2033.84
servant situation happening

2038.08 --> 2047.84
all right

2047.91 --> 2053.919
[Music]

2051.28 --> 2054.7200000000003
yeah and by the way has anybody actually

2053.919 --> 2057.1189999999997
been

2054.72 --> 2058.72
keeping track of his activity does he

2057.119 --> 2061.04
still have activities

2058.72 --> 2062.1589999999997
is he still on that tony starring show

2061.04 --> 2063.839
or

2062.159 --> 2066.159
what is he doing now i don't know i

2063.839 --> 2068.72
haven't heard from him in a

2066.159 --> 2068.7200000000003
in a while

2069.599 --> 2089.839
and haven't really looked

2075.76 --> 2089.8390000000004
he has a show with alex what who's alex

2090.399 --> 2093.839
servant at pete

2094.0 --> 2099.599
what what pete pj pete and pete

2100.839 --> 2106.64
what

2102.88 --> 2106.6400000000003
okay it's a

2107.04 --> 2111.7599999999998
peachy oh this is all right

2112.56 --> 2119.68
well i'm not

2116.0 --> 2123.359
surprised though you know look

2119.68 --> 2124.16
what he has a show you say an actual

2123.359 --> 2128.839
show

2124.16 --> 2131.839
like regularly or is it just random live

2128.839 --> 2131.839
streams

2133.68 --> 2138.24
pga can be entertaining indeed but it's

2137.04 --> 2140.88
funny because

2138.24 --> 2143.4399999999996
yeah the man is kind of a a little

2140.88 --> 2145.839
puzzle of his own and

2143.44 --> 2147.839
try to address it like yeah yeah your

2145.839 --> 2150.64
starker side is actually interesting

2147.839 --> 2153.359
and then you drive it into nonsense you

2150.64 --> 2155.359
don't actually work out the concept

2153.359 --> 2157.92
i think sometimes that he just can't do

2155.359 --> 2161.04
it it just doesn't have the faculties to

2157.92 --> 2161.04
build what he saw

2163.52 --> 2168.72
it's almost tragic but

2166.88 --> 2171.839
yeah it is kind of interesting and i

2168.72 --> 2174.7999999999997
guess maybe good servant

2171.839 --> 2176.16
is just following up on that lead see

2174.8 --> 2178.2400000000002
seeing if he can get

2176.16 --> 2182.0
something out of pga or something i

2178.24 --> 2182.0
don't know i'm just speculating here

2183.92 --> 2189.6800000000003
like in a way i wouldn't mind like

2187.359 --> 2190.88
having a a conversation even recorded

2189.68 --> 2193.2799999999997
with pga again

2190.88 --> 2193.28
it's just

2195.839 --> 2200.7999999999997
because yeah every now and then it can

2198.0 --> 2203.68
be interesting

2200.8 --> 2206.32
especially if he tries to hold his

2203.68 --> 2209.44
tongue and not get all savonier

2206.32 --> 2212.0
then yeah conversation with pj can be

2209.44 --> 2212.0
halfway

2212.839 --> 2215.839
interesting

2225.119 --> 2229.599
huh secretary yeah i thought i already

2228.4 --> 2232.96
yeah i thought you were

2229.599 --> 2235.44
up you being in my chat is already kind

2232.96 --> 2235.44
of rare

2237.839 --> 2243.839
living a night owl lifestyle

2245.92 --> 2257.839
hey anna koella you think

2249.76 --> 2257.8390000000004
you like his work

2275.52 --> 2281.92
i mean like he had a show before

2278.72 --> 2284.0789999999997
and all that said with this tom parker

2281.92 --> 2286.64
guy i even went on there a couple of

2284.079 --> 2288.5600000000004
times and

2286.64 --> 2290.56
yeah he's just trying to be a good

2288.56 --> 2294.88
christian all the time

2290.56 --> 2297.119
like maybe a little bit too much uh

2294.88 --> 2298.8
i guess if you appreciate that good

2297.119 --> 2301.44
spirit

2298.8 --> 2303.119
then yeah it is kind of nice to watch

2301.44 --> 2307.359
that

2303.119 --> 2309.119
as for like bigger solutions and deeper

2307.359 --> 2310.56
thinking processes i kind of

2309.119 --> 2312.96
i kind of thought it was a little bit

2310.56 --> 2317.92
boring but then again i

2312.96 --> 2317.92
get bored quite easily like that

2324.8 --> 2333.8390000000004
he's cool and he means well right

2328.8 --> 2333.8390000000004
but he's also kind of delusional

2336.0 --> 2341.04
well that kind of he is just delusional

2338.32 --> 2343.2000000000003
in ways

2341.04 --> 2346.48
and his solutions are always very

2343.2 --> 2346.48
christian and simple

2352.839 --> 2355.839
but

2356.079 --> 2359.2000000000003
yeah his actions

2360.24 --> 2369.839
i don't know no mind of god

2364.079 --> 2369.8390000000004
you don't don't do that it's ridiculous

2379.359 --> 2384.0789999999997
yeah when it comes to that part yeah

2381.92 --> 2388.0
servant of satan i think that

2384.079 --> 2388.0
you're closer to that than he is

2388.64 --> 2393.359
don't know if you realize that from

2391.76 --> 2396.079
things that i've seen from you

2393.359 --> 2396.72
good servant never went there never like

2396.079 --> 2400.1600000000003
that

2396.72 --> 2401.68
you have so

2400.16 --> 2403.44
maybe you should hold your tongue on

2401.68 --> 2410.16
that

2403.44 --> 2412.88
my god

2410.16 --> 2413.44
when will the stumps of obedient slaves

2412.88 --> 2425.839
wake up

2413.44 --> 2429.44
well they they don't

2425.839 --> 2429.44
i don't think they are gonna wake up

2435.04 --> 2438.079
they'll just get more complainy and more

2437.52 --> 2440.64
worried

2438.079 --> 2441.119
and all that but they're not gonna wake

2440.64 --> 2444.24
up

2441.119 --> 2446.6400000000003
they would have could have woken up they

2444.24 --> 2448.56
would have now

2446.64 --> 2450.64
everything that's presented they've a

2448.56 --> 2454.48
lot of people just have chosen to ignore

2450.64 --> 2454.48
it and double down so i don't yet

2454.96 --> 2458.64
some points there's just no more use

2457.28 --> 2461.44
trying to wake them up because they

2458.64 --> 2461.44
don't want to

2462.079 --> 2469.5
nothing can make them wake up

2466.45 --> 2469.5
[Music]

2502.079 --> 2506.48
right so i think that instead of just

2504.8 --> 2508.8
staring at the masses

2506.48 --> 2511.04
and being very frustrated and hoping

2508.8 --> 2512.96
what is going to take it

2511.04 --> 2516.72
for them to wake up instead of thinking

2512.96 --> 2520.56
like that i'd rather focus on

2516.72 --> 2525.52
what can you do about yourself

2520.56 --> 2530.0
and what you do in order to be

2525.52 --> 2532.72
less influenced and less stressed out

2530.0 --> 2533.68
about the fact that those people out

2532.72 --> 2536.0789999999997
there

2533.68 --> 2537.2
are not going to be woken up because

2536.079 --> 2540.1600000000003
they don't want to

2537.2 --> 2542.48
they'd rather die they don't consciously

2540.16 --> 2544.96
realize that but that is what is

2542.48 --> 2544.96
happening

2546.4 --> 2549.28
there's people out there like that

2547.68 --> 2552.16
there's people that are just trying to

2549.28 --> 2554.4
get along that don't want it

2552.16 --> 2555.68
just stretching their patients and

2554.4 --> 2558.079
there's others that just

2555.68 --> 2560.7999999999997
really don't care they just really don't

2558.079 --> 2565.04
care they'll do whatever it said

2560.8 --> 2569.2000000000003
whatever is said top down

2565.04 --> 2571.359
and it is more productive in my opinion

2569.2 --> 2574.3999999999996
to just focus on yourself and see

2571.359 --> 2577.359
like how can i learn to be

2574.4 --> 2579.359
okay with that because there's really

2577.359 --> 2582.0789999999997
nothing you can do to change it

2579.359 --> 2582.0789999999997
you can't

2584.72 --> 2588.64
the only thing that's basically left is

2586.8 --> 2591.44
just trying to be

2588.64 --> 2594.319
an example a better and better example

2591.44 --> 2597.359
to potentially inspire people

2594.319 --> 2601.2
among those people to basically

2597.359 --> 2604.56
figure out like well

2601.2 --> 2604.56
maybe i can be different

2604.64 --> 2607.92
but you'll never know until they step

2606.88 --> 2611.04
out of it

2607.92 --> 2614.64
that's the best you can hope for really

2611.04 --> 2617.04
just be an alternative example

2614.64 --> 2618.319
as radiant as possible as confident as

2617.04 --> 2621.44
possible

2618.319 --> 2624.4
and knowing ways out and

2621.44 --> 2626.56
through and just try to set that example

2624.4 --> 2628.1600000000003
and then hopefully some people will take

2626.56 --> 2630.72
notice and at the right moment in the

2628.16 --> 2630.72
right time

2631.2 --> 2634.24
they will you know use that as a

2633.2 --> 2637.04
stepping stone

2634.24 --> 2637.839
to try to get out of that mental

2637.04 --> 2642.16
position

2637.839 --> 2645.2799999999997
of of just obedience constant obedience

2642.16 --> 2649.839
to a tyrannical system that's the best

2645.28 --> 2649.8390000000004
you can hope for

2661.52 --> 2665.68
yeah tear it 306 i know it's going to be

2664.319 --> 2667.2799999999997
i don't know if it's going to be this

2665.68 --> 2668.8799999999997
year but it will be at some point

2667.28 --> 2671.28
they're basically going to cage

2668.88 --> 2673.04
everyone in and you won't be able to

2671.28 --> 2675.52
travel anywhere unless

2673.04 --> 2677.839
you take a bit of slow death that's

2675.52 --> 2677.839
right

2679.599 --> 2684.0
so can you stop talking about it now

2682.079 --> 2686.48
because yes we know it's there

2684.0 --> 2688.319
they're going to push caging everybody

2686.48 --> 2689.599
in and if you want to move over those

2688.319 --> 2690.0
border you're going to have to take a

2689.599 --> 2693.44
bit of

2690.0 --> 2695.52
slow death yes we know

2693.44 --> 2697.2000000000003
you don't have to freaking say it every

2695.52 --> 2700.8
damn day okay

2697.2 --> 2703.359
can you drop it it's like all

2700.8 --> 2705.44
freaking media is ramming that [ __ ] in

2703.359 --> 2706.88
your face we know it already

2705.44 --> 2709.68
that's what they're gonna do that's what

2706.88 --> 2709.6800000000003
they're gonna try

2710.29 --> 2713.4
[Music]

2715.92 --> 2720.16
so it's time to find other ways to do it

2722.8 --> 2728.7200000000003
it comes down to that just probably

2725.839 --> 2729.04
in general all air traffic is going to

2728.72 --> 2732.0789999999997
be

2729.04 --> 2734.88
for zombies only

2732.079 --> 2736.88
no more convenient quick travel except

2734.88 --> 2740.56
for people that are willing to die

2736.88 --> 2740.56
a slow death for it

2741.839 --> 2745.7599999999998
and not just once constantly constantly

2744.72 --> 2748.72
keep on injecting

2745.76 --> 2750.3190000000004
injecting injecting until you die from

2748.72 --> 2755.2
it

2750.319 --> 2755.2
yes we know you can stop echoing that

2756.9 --> 2761.839
[Music]

2758.839 --> 2761.839
now

2772.839 --> 2775.839
uh

2780.16 --> 2785.42
no no my god has nothing to do with that

2783.76 --> 2787.6800000000003
anymore

2785.42 --> 2790.4
[Music]

2787.68 --> 2792.3999999999996
the agenda doesn't care anymore when

2790.4 --> 2793.119
their people know the earth is flat or

2792.4 --> 2797.44
not

2793.119 --> 2800.48
it has moved on to execution phase

2797.44 --> 2801.68
slowly corralling people closing the

2800.48 --> 2804.96
gates

2801.68 --> 2807.7599999999998
allowing people through only through

2804.96 --> 2808.319
slow death that's their plan they don't

2807.76 --> 2810.0
care

2808.319 --> 2812.079
what you believe anymore don't you get

2810.0 --> 2816.72
it they don't care

2812.079 --> 2820.079
they literally don't give a [ __ ]

2816.72 --> 2821.2
what you believe what you think what you

2820.079 --> 2823.2000000000003
want they don't

2821.2 --> 2825.2799999999997
care about the earth being fled and

2823.2 --> 2829.2799999999997
everybody figuring it out you understand

2825.28 --> 2833.52
they don't care about that anymore

2829.28 --> 2833.52
do you understand

2834.96 --> 2838.96
the controllers the planners the agenda

2837.839 --> 2841.92
it doesn't

2838.96 --> 2843.52
care anymore whether you believe the

2841.92 --> 2846.7200000000003
earth is flat or not

2843.52 --> 2849.68
do you understand stop

2846.72 --> 2850.9599999999996
fooling yourself into thinking that that

2849.68 --> 2853.44
is some kind of

2850.96 --> 2854.16
important thing or that you're a special

2853.44 --> 2855.92
boy

2854.16 --> 2857.2799999999997
because you believe the earth is flat

2855.92 --> 2871.9
they don't care

2857.28 --> 2875.639
anymore you understand

2871.9 --> 2875.639
[Music]

2882.0 --> 2888.8
no that's not what i said minor god

2885.76 --> 2889.119
flat earth is not irrelevant it's just

2888.8 --> 2892.079
that

2889.119 --> 2894.0
the ones that are designing everything

2892.079 --> 2897.04
that is unrolling

2894.0 --> 2899.28
they don't care i'm not saying flat

2897.04 --> 2902.16
earth is not important for the learning

2899.28 --> 2904.4
process of awakening it's just that

2902.16 --> 2906.0789999999997
they don't really care anymore whether

2904.4 --> 2908.7200000000003
people awaken or not

2906.079 --> 2909.6800000000003
they're moving on with the next phase of

2908.72 --> 2912.8799999999997
the plan

2909.68 --> 2915.5989999999997
on to extermination they don't

2912.88 --> 2917.28
care anymore whether everybody

2915.599 --> 2918.1600000000003
eventually will believe the earth is

2917.28 --> 2929.8390000000004
flat

2918.16 --> 2929.839
they don't care do you understand

2931.76 --> 2935.2000000000003
no they're not gonna disband nasa

2933.839 --> 2938.319
they're not gonna disband

2935.2 --> 2942.24
anything they're just gonna let it

2938.319 --> 2945.44
be as it is and slowly move

2942.24 --> 2946.4799999999996
worldwide population to closing the

2945.44 --> 2949.44
borders

2946.48 --> 2951.04
only letting people through by slow

2949.44 --> 2954.48
death

2951.04 --> 2955.68
and then just let it slowly exterminate

2954.48 --> 2959.28
people

2955.68 --> 2959.2799999999997
for as long as they can hold out

2960.96 --> 2971.839
that's it

3003.68 --> 3007.04
yeah i don't even know what this is

3006.0 --> 3009.68
about soul

3007.04 --> 3011.04
and free will i don't even know exactly

3009.68 --> 3012.7999999999997
what the vaccinations are

3011.04 --> 3014.88
to do but if there's going to be some

3012.8 --> 3018.1600000000003
significant spiritual or

3014.88 --> 3022.0
psychological damage from them

3018.16 --> 3025.68
besides just death then that will come

3022.0 --> 3030.64
become blatantly apparent

3025.68 --> 3033.839
very quickly when people are just

3030.64 --> 3034.4
no longer themselves as they were they

3033.839 --> 3036.7999999999997
just go

3034.4 --> 3038.96
full autopilot and like their own family

3036.8 --> 3041.119
doesn't even recognize them anymore yeah

3038.96 --> 3044.16
it's going to cause

3041.119 --> 3046.079
a lot of craziness

3044.16 --> 3047.2
when that becomes apparent if that is

3046.079 --> 3055.8390000000004
the case

3047.2 --> 3055.839
or it's just random slow death

3064.8 --> 3071.8390000000004
zero steamy traveler zero

3068.4 --> 3072.7200000000003
zero people i know that doesn't make any

3071.839 --> 3076.319
sense

3072.72 --> 3078.16
but they don't care

3076.319 --> 3079.7599999999998
they think that they can literally

3078.16 --> 3081.92
exterminate everything

3079.76 --> 3084.3190000000004
and just let everything be automated and

3081.92 --> 3086.319
compute they're that superficial and

3084.319 --> 3089.2
stupid

3086.319 --> 3091.359

3117.359 --> 3122.24
they don't want to lose power so it is

3119.04 --> 3125.359

it's hard to tell

we're just getting to see the overt

even the real controllers they are not

it you know what it is

3542.88 --> 3548.96
it's a terror tactic

3546.48 --> 3552.4
it's literally just showing everybody

3548.96 --> 3554.079
like yeah we got you now

3552.4 --> 3556.319
and if you don't cooperate we're

3554.079 --> 3557.3590000000004
literally just going to execute you

3556.319 --> 3559.7599999999998

that's what that is that's the terror

3559.76 --> 3564.6800000000003
they're trying to spread and that's why

3561.52 --> 3565.839
everybody gets to know about it

3564.68 --> 3568.799
everybody

3565.839 --> 3570.319
in the freaking world gets to know about

3568.799 --> 3574.48
it unless they choose

3570.319 --> 3575.2799999999997
not to look they click it away as soon

3574.48 --> 3576.96
as they see it

3575.28 --> 3580.1600000000003
it's getting tough because it is

3576.96 --> 3583.92

3583.92 --> 3587.76

3586.96 --> 3592.7200000000003

telling people like oh yeah yeah oh the

muslims are coming and they're going to

3608.0 --> 3614.079
suicide bomb all over the place

3611.28 --> 3616.0
it's the same effect like yeah that was

3614.079 --> 3616.6400000000003
information handed down to you yeah of

3616.0 --> 3618.88
course that

3616.64 --> 3621.52
technically did not happen except maybe

3618.88 --> 3625.119
in the middle east here and there

3621.52 --> 3628.24
but it's contributing to the terror

3625.119 --> 3629.359
tactic so don't do that everybody

3628.24 --> 3632.799
already knows

3629.359 --> 3633.5989999999997
it's so in your face it's really hard to

3632.799 --> 3636.88
get away

3633.599 --> 3639.2000000000003
from attaining that information

3636.88 --> 3641.44
in general it's really hard to avoid it

3639.2 --> 3643.2799999999997
so you don't need to pile it on

3641.44 --> 3647.599
it's not something you need to spread

3643.28 --> 3647.599
around because nobody can get away from

3654.839 --> 3658.16
it

3656.16 --> 3662.0789999999997
no that's not the definition of terror

3658.16 --> 3662.0789999999997
that's a definition of terrorism

3662.16 --> 3669.68
terrorism is political terror

3665.359 --> 3673.04
is just terror it's just pure fear

3669.68 --> 3685.839

3701.28 --> 3703.76
you think

3706.0 --> 3712.48
yeah terror tactics is not

3709.119 --> 3715.039
terrorism now terrorism can be

3712.48 --> 3717.92
classified as a terror tactic but it is

3715.039 --> 3717.92
more specific

think an alien invasion

3822.16 --> 3826.319
would be better it's just the story

doesn't mean that

3834.48 --> 3837.68
everything is going to go away it just

you

3948.839 --> 3951.839
elite

3952.559 --> 3956.6400000000003
and being a flat earther in the at this

3954.88 --> 3959.92
point is much more than just

3956.64 --> 3963.44
knowing the earth is flat

3959.92 --> 3966.96
it's also about

3963.44 --> 3970.16
the truth and going against

3966.96 --> 3973.44
the universal lie literally universal

3970.16 --> 3973.44
lies of government

3974.559 --> 3982.3190000000004
so it is cut yeah in a way it is

3978.72 --> 3984.48
there is a bit of anarchy to flat earth

3982.319 --> 3988.4
but yeah that doesn't mean it has to be

3984.48 --> 3990.72
fully anti-government it could also be

3988.4 --> 3992.88
well do a cosmogonical society type

3990.72 --> 3995.5989999999997
scenario just like okay

3992.88 --> 3996.079
we don't want to we want to have freedom

3995.599 --> 3999.28
from the

3996.079 --> 4002.7200000000003
we don't want to be part of the lies but

3999.28 --> 4005.44
yeah if you really think you can stop it

4002.72 --> 4007.9199999999996
you think you can literally stop it good

4005.44 --> 4011.28
luck with that

4007.92 --> 4012.64
because every time somebody actually

4011.28 --> 4015.6800000000003
tries that

4012.64 --> 4018.48
there's a huge amount of people that die

4015.68 --> 4019.44
every freaking time so good luck with

4018.48 --> 4021.52
that

4019.44 --> 4024.559
good luck with getting the lies out of

4021.52 --> 4024.559
government like that

4025.599 --> 4033.839
like overthrowing it like really routing

4030.16 --> 4035.68
those key people good luck with that you

4033.839 --> 4039.44
think you can do that

4035.68 --> 4039.839
well unless you are literally prepared

4039.44 --> 4042.799
to

4039.839 --> 4045.92
die for it you probably shouldn't even

4042.799 --> 4045.92
be considering it

4047.44 --> 4050.7200000000003
now it's much more sensible to just

4049.44 --> 4054.079
figure out

4050.72 --> 4056.48
how to be separate and how to find a way

4054.079 --> 4056.48
past

4058.079 --> 4061.039
past government

4061.52 --> 4066.24
best we can hope for in my opinion is to

4066.319 --> 4070.0
find a place where we can be ourselves

4069.039 --> 4073.039
still

4070.0 --> 4075.68
live lives and stay

4073.039 --> 4077.8390000000004
as much out of government based control

4075.68 --> 4080.5589999999997
scams as possible and then

4077.839 --> 4083.359
get that room to do that and not just be

4080.559 --> 4086.799
coerced into it

4083.359 --> 4087.92
that is really what i think yeah one of

4086.799 --> 4091.0389999999998
the more logical

4087.92 --> 4095.28
aims that we can hope for

4091.039 --> 4099.12
that by waking up you can bypass

4095.28 --> 4099.12
mind control schemes of government

4103.44 --> 4107.3589999999995
because you're not gonna stop it

4108.88 --> 4115.759
not really you can only just

4112.56 --> 4118.88
yeah wake people up from it

4115.759 --> 4122.159
if they want to wake up

4118.88 --> 4123.92
and then yeah leave yeah prevent damage

4122.159 --> 4127.92
that way

4123.92 --> 4130.799
keep enough human livestock

4127.92 --> 4132.319
in prime condition mentally spiritually

4130.799 --> 4135.44
and physically

4132.319 --> 4140.719
to make the human race survive

4135.44 --> 4140.719
over time that

4142.48 --> 4147.5199999999995
it's also part of the own benjamin

4144.799 --> 4149.5199999999995
concept that is also what he thinks i

4147.52 --> 4151.52
believe so at least

4149.52 --> 4153.52
and i agree with that notion it's a much

4151.52 --> 4155.279
more sensible aim

4153.52 --> 4156.799000000001
because when you do it like that you

4155.279 --> 4159.359
don't overtly

4156.799 --> 4159.92
try to take away the control and the

4159.359 --> 4162.96
power

4159.92 --> 4166.4800000000005
from the people that have it just

4162.96 --> 4175.839
try to find a way past it

4166.48 --> 4175.839
or through it

4214.84 --> 4222.8
hmm

4217.6 --> 4222.8
10 mile radius plan yes cute

4223.76 --> 4228.0
well yeah it does really look there is

4228.56 --> 4233.1990000000005
ways to figure it but it takes a lot of

4230.88 --> 4235.52
work and dedication to figure out how to

4233.199 --> 4236.21
become really self-sufficient with very

4235.52 --> 4237.76
little room

4236.21 --> 4240.4
[Music]

4237.76 --> 4240.96
and sit through all the madness without

4240.4 --> 4244.0
being

4240.96 --> 4246.0
influenced or coerced into anything

4244.0 --> 4247.28
but it's really tough but if enough

4246.0 --> 4249.76
people at least

4247.28 --> 4251.36
try it out then there will be

4249.76 --> 4254.56
development

4251.36 --> 4257.28
there will be development and also

4254.56 --> 4258.159000000001
corporations will not be able to help

4257.28 --> 4260.88
but play

4258.159 --> 4261.839999999999
into it and actually make it more viable

4260.88 --> 4263.36
and efficient

4261.84 --> 4265.6
because they can't help it it's a it's

4263.36 --> 4267.839999999999
corporate it's undead it does not have

4265.6 --> 4268.88
its will it just goes where development

4267.84 --> 4273.360000000001
and money is

4268.88 --> 4275.76
you see so if enough people do that

4273.36 --> 4278.159
corporations will have no choice but to

4275.76 --> 4281.6
just follow suit

4278.159 --> 4282.48
because for whatever they want they

4281.6 --> 4286.08
cannot help

4282.48 --> 4288.639999999999
avoid wanting profit and new market

4286.08 --> 4289.12
grounds they cannot help it so if we

4288.64 --> 4292.56
just

4289.12 --> 4295.36
force that by choosing a specific

4292.56 --> 4298.0
direction of development for ourselves

4295.36 --> 4301.839999999999
then they will help us out whether they

4298.0 --> 4301.84
want to or not

4306.48 --> 4313.28
and there's a lot of improvement room

4309.92 --> 4313.28
technology wise for

4313.44 --> 4315.839999999999
farming

4316.88 --> 4324.159000000001
agriculture all kinds

4320.48 --> 4329.839999999999
yeah it's so many things

4324.159 --> 4329.839999999999
very easy things to do

4330.239 --> 4343.04
and even technology wise at some point i

4332.96 --> 4346.4
think that

4343.04 --> 4346.4
yeah would that work

4349.36 --> 4352.96
i don't know i just think there's

4353.36 --> 4356.639999999999
there is room and there could be

4355.92 --> 4359.36
maintained

4356.64 --> 4360.08
room for people to stay out of the

4359.36 --> 4363.679
system

4360.08 --> 4363.679
without being destroyed

4365.199 --> 4369.839999999999
yeah and the amish indeed but the amish

4367.92 --> 4370.88
are like even a step further because

4369.84 --> 4374.0
they don't even use

4370.88 --> 4374.0
internet and all that

4376.239 --> 4379.28
and doing without internet is going to

4378.719 --> 4382.4
be much

4379.28 --> 4385.679
tougher for western society and well

4382.4 --> 4388.159
half the world by now

4385.679 --> 4389.12
but then again yeah if they this is

4388.159 --> 4392.639999999999
always it you know

4389.12 --> 4396.08
if they just kill that

4392.64 --> 4399.12
then everything changes dramatically

4396.08 --> 4402.159
really dramatically and

4399.12 --> 4404.239
i don't think they can control what

4402.159 --> 4407.36
comes out of such a situation i don't

4404.239 --> 4409.28
think they can do that at all

4407.36 --> 4411.839999999999
because there will be just a yeah

4409.28 --> 4415.28
communication

4411.84 --> 4415.28
and then they just lose grip

4422.88 --> 4426.56
and the amish will just persist they

4424.719 --> 4428.4800000000005
will just keep on going as they always

4426.56 --> 4430.96
have

4428.48 --> 4431.759999999999
but there could be basic yeah there

4430.96 --> 4435.28
could be a

4431.76 --> 4437.6
amish light version a hybrid

4435.28 --> 4439.28
attempt a little bit more

4437.6 --> 4442.64
technologically advanced but

4439.28 --> 4445.84
very aimed at being self-sufficient

4442.64 --> 4447.740000000001
and bertaria in its own way kind of is

4445.84 --> 4449.76
an attempt towards that

4447.74 --> 4453.04
[Music]

4449.76 --> 4456.320000000001
it is very admirable and interesting

4453.04 --> 4460.4
and just yeah a time for development and

4456.32 --> 4469.84
figuring it out what is this new thing

4460.4 --> 4469.839999999999
that we have to do to get through this

4480.8 --> 4489.360000000001
give no

4484.96 --> 4489.36
absolutely not i just explained that

4491.679 --> 4495.92
if the internet was disabled there would

4493.84 --> 4498.0
be a massive collapse and then the

4495.92 --> 4500.0
consequences would be out of everybody's

4498.0 --> 4503.04
hands

4500.0 --> 4504.4
including the controller but yeah it

4503.04 --> 4507.84
would destroy

4504.4 --> 4511.12
everything it'll just create

4507.84 --> 4513.76
famine and just hysteria

4511.12 --> 4513.76
big time

4520.0 --> 4523.09
[Music]

4523.6 --> 4528.320000000001
and not just look can you imagine what

4526.159 --> 4528.639999999999
happens if all these people that are now

4528.32 --> 4531.759999999999
all

4528.64 --> 4533.4400000000005
using the internet to squirt all day or

4531.76 --> 4535.84
to be like

4533.44 --> 4537.44
i'm so angry with this i'm so angry i

4535.84 --> 4539.679
have to say it

4537.44 --> 4541.04
right well just imagine if there was no

4539.679 --> 4543.4400000000005
more internet

4541.04 --> 4544.32
for those people to do that yeah guess

4543.44 --> 4547.44
what's gonna happen

4544.32 --> 4549.599999999999
it's gonna start moving into

4547.44 --> 4550.159
face-to-face situations yeah the world's

4549.6 --> 4567.84
gonna be

4550.159 --> 4567.839999999999
[ __ ] that's what's gonna happen

4590.0 --> 4593.36
the internet if anything keeping people

4592.32 --> 4595.84
in place

4593.36 --> 4595.839999999999
sort of

4596.96 --> 4604.4
in ways it helps keep

4600.32 --> 4609.84
people stay in place

4604.4 --> 4609.839999999999
if that is what they use it for

4610.0 --> 4623.84
it also helps people to get to places

4613.36 --> 4623.839999999999
if that is what they're looking for

4624.64 --> 4628.2390000000005
the internet would not go away well i

4626.88 --> 4630.719
wouldn't recommend

4628.239 --> 4633.199
for them to for any reason turn off the

4630.719 --> 4633.199
internet

4634.48 --> 4639.759999999999
the consequences would just be out of

4636.32 --> 4639.759999999999
control that's what i'm saying

4644.56 --> 4648.56
and in a way yeah the internet the

4647.679 --> 4651.679
controllers

4648.56 --> 4652.96
use the internet everything is being

4651.679 --> 4657.04
held together

4652.96 --> 4661.199
also by them through the internet

4657.04 --> 4663.84
if they confiscate the internet

4661.199 --> 4665.678999999999
yeah then still the chaos out there is

4663.84 --> 4667.4400000000005
going to unroll and there's going to be

4665.679 --> 4669.1990000000005
hacking and bypassing

4667.44 --> 4670.48
and because the structural frame is

4669.199 --> 4674.4
still there

4670.48 --> 4676.5599999999995
so there is just no way i do not advise

4674.4 --> 4676.5599999999995
it

4677.28 --> 4693.84
hear me grabblers don't do that it would

4679.84 --> 4693.84
be very stupid

4696.8 --> 4702.159000000001
two controllers of all control over the

4699.52 --> 4707.84
internet what

4702.159 --> 4707.839999999999
that's a very vague question

4710.8 --> 4717.76
i think that the amount of control that

4714.64 --> 4718.320000000001
con controllers the planners the the big

4717.76 --> 4720.4800000000005
guys

4718.32 --> 4722.159
in the shadows and the mega corporations

4720.48 --> 4724.4
actually have over the internet

4722.159 --> 4725.679
i think that's being exaggerated i think

4724.4 --> 4728.08
that people

4725.679 --> 4730.159
overestimate how much control they they

4728.08 --> 4733.04
have

4730.159 --> 4734.0
there's just a lot of suggestions and

4733.04 --> 4737.04
manipulations

4734.0 --> 4738.8
going on and that creates an image like

4737.04 --> 4740.08
they are more in control than they

4738.8 --> 4744.64
probably are

4740.08 --> 4744.64
the internet is like an incredibly free

4746.84 --> 4750.88
place but yeah

4748.56 --> 4752.400000000001
if you get fooled into believing it's

4750.88 --> 4755.12
not then you may be

4752.4 --> 4757.5199999999995
free in that place without realizing it

4755.12 --> 4759.92
and you'll be your own gatekeeper

4757.52 --> 4762.400000000001
as part of the tactics that's standard

4759.92 --> 4765.679
approach tactics for them to maintain

4762.4 --> 4767.44
more control is by bluffing that they

4765.679 --> 4777.84
are in control

4767.44 --> 4777.839999999999
in ways that they actually aren't

4783.28 --> 4787.759999999999
when cable no longer had anything for my

4785.6 --> 4790.08
family i cut it out

4787.76 --> 4790.96
right television i haven't watched

4790.08 --> 4794.32
television in

4790.96 --> 4796.56
ages every time i even get a short

4794.32 --> 4799.28
glimpse of it i'm just like oh my god

4796.56 --> 4802.400000000001
i'm so glad i'm over that

4799.28 --> 4804.08
because just the radiance that comes off

4802.4 --> 4806.08
it in just a few seconds

4804.08 --> 4808.719
every time no matter if it's an

4806.08 --> 4812.8
advertisement or some show

4808.719 --> 4813.76
it's just like oh i can't believe i used

4812.8 --> 4819.84
to watch that

4813.76 --> 4819.84
i can't believe it it's so horrible

4840.56 --> 4844.159000000001
yeah and besides any everything that i

4842.8 --> 4848.8
used to kind of watch

4844.159 --> 4851.04
on tv basically the reason why i watch

4848.8 --> 4853.6
it i've eventually found that on the

4851.04 --> 4853.6
internet

4855.12 --> 4859.36
you can just find those things on the

4856.96 --> 4861.6
internet or even download it and yeah so

4859.36 --> 4865.12
why would i need the tv anymore to watch

4861.6 --> 4867.52
really stupid advertisement to be

4865.12 --> 4870.239
socially engineering manipulation

4867.52 --> 4873.280000000001
programs in your face

4870.239 --> 4877.12
to learn more medical nonsense

4873.28 --> 4879.36
of covid no i don't really feel like

4877.12 --> 4879.36
that

4886.84 --> 4889.84
thanks

4890.96 --> 4903.84
yeah yeah hey nathan ugly

4929.679 --> 4934.96
right so yeah watching tv is a woof

4937.28 --> 4945.12
it's all just massively grappled

4941.52 --> 4949.159000000001
it's all

4945.12 --> 4952.08
arrogant satanic luciferian

4949.159 --> 4956.32
anti-christian gay as

4952.08 --> 4959.84
freaking gay as they can possibly get it

4956.32 --> 4959.84
they're always pushing that [ __ ]

4960.56 --> 4964.080000000001
it's like all these people that aren't

4962.4 --> 4966.4
even officially gay that

4964.08 --> 4968.08
act gay so even if they don't have

4966.4 --> 4971.36
official gays

4968.08 --> 4975.04
they just have people that act gay it's

4971.36 --> 4977.199
so annoying and everybody takes over

4975.04 --> 4979.84
that habit and [ __ ]

4977.199 --> 4982.799999999999
it's like oh it's okay to act like

4979.84 --> 4982.8
you're gay now

4982.88 --> 4987.84
no it's not

4992.8 --> 4996.56
just feels to me like the tv is just

4994.8 --> 4998.320000000001
constantly chanting

4996.56 --> 4999.84
like just let down your guard just let

4998.32 --> 5002.719
down your guard it's all safe just let

4999.84 --> 5002.719
down your guard just

5002.8 --> 5008.320000000001
let the corruption sink in you're

5005.199 --> 5008.32
supposed to corrupt

5009.04 --> 5012.0
that's what it's doing

5013.6 --> 5017.280000000001
that's okay to believe lies it's okay to

5016.0 --> 5020.96
just defy

5017.28 --> 5022.639
everything because you can it's okay

5020.96 --> 5024.719
we're supposed to do that everybody's

5022.639 --> 5028.719
doing it so you do it too because it's

5024.719 --> 5043.84
the only thing you can do that's

5028.719 --> 5043.84
tv for you

5044.159 --> 5048.48
oh secret age man that does not sound

5046.239 --> 5057.839999999999
good maybe you should see like a

5048.48 --> 5057.839999999999
chiropractor or something

5075.199 --> 5078.48
there what do you mean finish this chat

5077.84 --> 5081.360000000001
is being

5078.48 --> 5083.678999999999
chopped in so many ways what does that

5081.36 --> 5099.839999999999
mean

5083.679 --> 5099.84
i have no idea what you mean with that

5100.56 --> 5106.159000000001
what kind of a question is that steamy

5103.6 --> 5106.159000000001
traveler

5108.08 --> 5113.84
yes of course they're monitoring me

5117.679 --> 5123.1990000000005
elimination well i've never even had a

5120.32 --> 5127.12
strike or a warning

5123.199 --> 5128.638999999999
anything so no i used to be quite

5127.12 --> 5130.8
paranoia

5128.639 --> 5133.52
pretty severely when i started i was

5130.8 --> 5136.08
really afraid

5133.52 --> 5138.080000000001
that there might be some covert backlash

5136.08 --> 5141.28
or stuff

5138.08 --> 5141.84
because everybody hates or i thought so

5141.28 --> 5145.679
at least

5141.84 --> 5145.679
hated flat earth so much out there

5148.48 --> 5154.159
but it turns out it's just not the case

5151.28 --> 5156.4
it's just not

5154.159 --> 5157.199
so i don't know worry about elimination

5156.4 --> 5159.28
well look

5157.199 --> 5161.678999999999
if there is at some point some weird

5159.28 --> 5163.5199999999995
control scheme agenda or another group

5161.679 --> 5167.6
taking over and they decide

5163.52 --> 5168.080000000001
yes we are going to rewrite history once

5167.6 --> 5170.320000000001
again

5168.08 --> 5171.28
and put it all back together a coh

5170.32 --> 5175.28
cohesive

5171.28 --> 5176.8
type of vision for everybody and yeah

5175.28 --> 5180.08
that needs to include

5176.8 --> 5183.360000000001
include some serious space

5180.08 --> 5185.28
projects and like actually making a good

5183.36 --> 5187.92
attempt this time to put down

5185.28 --> 5189.44
really good well-crafted visuals instead

5187.92 --> 5191.84
of the crappy [ __ ]

5189.44 --> 5194.08
yeah if they're going to go for such an

5191.84 --> 5197.84
agenda it's very logical

5194.08 --> 5200.0
that in some way of destruction

5197.84 --> 5201.360000000001
they would also take out flat earthers

5200.0 --> 5204.719
just like oh they just

5201.36 --> 5207.04
happen to all die you know in that war

5204.719 --> 5208.4800000000005
we nobody really knows why that person

5207.04 --> 5211.28
got shot but

5208.48 --> 5212.239
yeah it's just uh random bullets or

5211.28 --> 5214.48
something yeah

5212.239 --> 5216.32
that's how they do that so yeah that

5214.48 --> 5218.638999999999
could happen could just happen just like

5216.32 --> 5223.44
that and then you're dead yeah

5218.639 --> 5227.76
well nothing really i can do about it

5223.44 --> 5231.12
accept hope that nobody will find it

5227.76 --> 5233.52
necessary enough or profitable enough or

5231.12 --> 5236.159
anything enough to go for such a step

5233.52 --> 5239.92
for such an agenda and just

5236.159 --> 5242.159
instead sticks to a interesting concept

5239.92 --> 5244.639
of a duo-cosmogonical society where just

5242.159 --> 5246.879999999999
flat earthers can just be flat earthers

5244.639 --> 5248.2390000000005
and globers can be globbers with all the

5246.88 --> 5250.0
consequences that come with it and the

5248.239 --> 5253.28
mind control agenda

5250.0 --> 5257.76
and let's just hope that can last a

5253.28 --> 5257.759999999999
very very long time

5258.239 --> 5264.959999999999
because when it stops yeah

5261.76 --> 5268.08
suddenly genocidal situations could

5264.96 --> 5268.4
unfold could happen just like that i

5268.08 --> 5272.0
know

5268.4 --> 5281.839999999999
it can so let's just try to prevent that

5272.0 --> 5281.84
for as long as we all can how about that

5287.44 --> 5293.5199999999995
see ira cia reading this chat no doubt

5290.96 --> 5295.679
no doubt i have no doubt that they all

5293.52 --> 5297.679
have some kind of tab on me

5295.679 --> 5298.88
but it's probably not even an agent

5297.679 --> 5302.96
watching it's just

5298.88 --> 5304.159000000001
automated information extraction and

5302.96 --> 5306.56
processing

5304.159 --> 5308.48
so they have they know i am here they

5306.56 --> 5312.0
probably tap information

5308.48 --> 5314.0
from me extract it through algorithm

5312.0 --> 5315.679
it doesn't mean anybody specifically

5314.0 --> 5317.44
following me

5315.679 --> 5318.96
but i'm pretty sure they keep an eye on

5317.44 --> 5323.839999999999
me

5318.96 --> 5323.84
probably half since the beginning

5324.239 --> 5328.239
that's why i've said like i've already

5325.76 --> 5332.159000000001
reconciled that i have no privacy

5328.239 --> 5334.48
i must assume that i don't have privacy

5332.159 --> 5336.32
i could claim the right to have privacy

5334.48 --> 5339.919999999999
but practically i don't and

5336.32 --> 5343.04
if i just reconcile with that and

5339.92 --> 5350.159
think from that angle i'll be better off

5343.04 --> 5352.639
in the end

5350.159 --> 5355.44
but i'm not afraid because i'm being

5352.639 --> 5358.400000000001
extremely honest

5355.44 --> 5359.28
i'm trying to do my best to be good and

5358.4 --> 5362.5599999999995
human

5359.28 --> 5365.759999999999
and sensible and interesting

5362.56 --> 5367.92
and i have surreal experiences and

5365.76 --> 5369.04
well what would be considered paranormal

5367.92 --> 5372.96
abilities to some

5369.04 --> 5376.4
level and

5372.96 --> 5378.159
utilize it all and somehow from this

5376.4 --> 5381.28
vantage point

5378.159 --> 5381.28
have an influence

5382.56 --> 5392.0
because i do try to sort of like

5386.88 --> 5394.8
from a fractal perspective also address

5392.0 --> 5398.0
controllers or people that are part of

5394.8 --> 5398.0
the control system

5400.719 --> 5407.679
i do address them too by trying to

5404.0 --> 5411.36
make them see sense and a future to go

5407.679 --> 5413.36
towards instead of just letting their co

5411.36 --> 5415.04
their control arm that have them in

5413.36 --> 5418.4
their grip let them kill

5415.04 --> 5420.639
kill them off so that everybody from

5418.4 --> 5421.92
every position can apply their spirits

5420.639 --> 5424.159000000001
somehow to

5421.92 --> 5428.2390000000005
help the situation make it better for

5424.159 --> 5430.799999999999
everybody including the controllers

5428.239 --> 5434.08
like the best thing we could all imagine

5430.8 --> 5437.6
for is that the actual controllers

5434.08 --> 5440.96
find peace in their hearts

5437.6 --> 5444.719
in order to stop the panic

5440.96 --> 5446.88
plan of let's just kill all the humans

5444.719 --> 5449.199
because they're too dangerous and

5446.88 --> 5452.32
instead start to be

5449.199 --> 5454.719
more like rulers again and actually

5452.32 --> 5455.44
help fix the situation with humanity and

5454.719 --> 5458.6
abandon

5455.44 --> 5461.599999999999
this ridiculous

5458.6 --> 5465.1990000000005
transhumanist robot society idea it's

5461.6 --> 5468.2390000000005
absolutely ludicrous it's not effective

5465.199 --> 5471.36
it's a delusion it can't work

5468.239 --> 5473.5199999999995
it can't work in a hundred years

5471.36 --> 5474.639
technology doesn't work like that you

5473.52 --> 5479.76
can't

5474.639 --> 5483.04
make robots that can repair themselves

5479.76 --> 5486.0
you can't do it it's impossible

5483.04 --> 5487.08
you will always need humans always

5486.0 --> 5490.159
always

5487.08 --> 5492.719
always and you can't even like

5490.159 --> 5496.5599999999995
minimize it or engineer it and you need

5492.719 --> 5496.56
the full-scale human beings

5496.8 --> 5501.4400000000005
in order to find the proper level of

5498.88 --> 5505.4800000000005
creativity to keep

5501.44 --> 5509.5199999999995
things going and they must

5505.48 --> 5512.48
concede to that and let go

5509.52 --> 5514.320000000001
of this ridiculous anti-human dream for

5512.48 --> 5518.239
the future for themselves

5514.32 --> 5518.5599999999995
because it cannot work it cannot work it

5518.239 --> 5520.638999999999
can

5518.56 --> 5522.4800000000005
only all be destroyed that's the only

5520.639 --> 5533.77
thing that can come out of it

5522.48 --> 5540.349999999999
caligula don't do it

5533.77 --> 5540.35
[Music]

5542.48 --> 5548.299
[Music]

5550.56 --> 5563.330000000001
[Music]

5566.159 --> 5568.48
all right

5569.44 --> 5576.719
but yeah maybe in ways it's already

5572.639 --> 5580.2390000000005
a type of being yeah a human being

5576.719 --> 5583.76
yeah they're trying to turn us from man

5580.239 --> 5587.599999999999
and woman into humans and from

5583.76 --> 5590.96
a human into a human being

5587.6 --> 5592.2390000000005
yeah you know a seed you plant in the

5590.96 --> 5595.84
ground

5592.239 --> 5599.04
like a crop understand

5595.84 --> 5602.8
from man and woman into humans

5599.04 --> 5605.92
from humans into a human being

5602.8 --> 5608.96
that's what they're doing or that's a

5605.92 --> 5608.96
that's a plan

5609.28 --> 5612.639
but at the same time there's a big

5610.96 --> 5615.84
awakening going on a

5612.639 --> 5616.719
release of information and people just

5615.84 --> 5620.159000000001
doing whatever

5616.719 --> 5622.88
experimenting being tested being prodded

5620.159 --> 5624.5599999999995
being souped up to be more

5622.88 --> 5626.159000000001
psychologically defensive

5624.56 --> 5628.84
everything it's just a lot of things

5626.159 --> 5630.239
unrolling which could also be a sign

5628.84 --> 5633.12
that

5630.239 --> 5636.638999999999
there is a potential abandonment of the

5633.12 --> 5639.599999999999
transhumanist agenda

5636.639 --> 5641.6
at the same time it's basically it could

5639.6 --> 5644.08
turn out to be a struggle between

5641.6 --> 5645.84
both of these directions that are just

5644.08 --> 5649.92
happening simultaneously

5645.84 --> 5654.159000000001
like two societal ideologies

5649.92 --> 5656.84
that are duking it out individualism and

5654.159 --> 5658.08
truth and awakening and the human

5656.84 --> 5660.96
struggle

5658.08 --> 5661.84
and confusion enlightenment true

5660.96 --> 5664.96
enlightenment

5661.84 --> 5668.400000000001
it's always struggle psychological

5664.96 --> 5669.44
always always a struggle and on the

5668.4 --> 5673.599999999999
other hand the

5669.44 --> 5678.0
the collectivism

5673.6 --> 5680.08
robotic anti-human ideology

5678.0 --> 5682.76
and they're just duking it out at the

5680.08 --> 5685.199
same time

5682.76 --> 5687.679
cross-crossing agendas happening

5685.199 --> 5689.199
playing out at the same time happening

5687.679 --> 5692.639
right now

5689.199 --> 5695.04
playing out simultaneously and it's up

5692.639 --> 5695.04
to us

5695.28 --> 5704.159
to come out of it on one side

5701.52 --> 5704.639
let's make it the right side let's not

5704.159 --> 5707.599999999999
choose

5704.639 --> 5708.2390000000005
death let's not be demoralized and let

5707.6 --> 5712.0
death

5708.239 --> 5715.44
agenda take over don't give up

5712.0 --> 5716.639
be strong endure the manipulation and

5715.44 --> 5720.159
the insanity grow

5716.639 --> 5720.8
wiser because you must you must take the

5720.159 --> 5723.839999999999
pain you

5720.8 --> 5725.76
must take it

5723.84 --> 5727.04
and then when you've taken it there's

5725.76 --> 5728.639
more

5727.04 --> 5730.32
you don't have to take it right away you

5728.639 --> 5733.119
have time to recover

5730.32 --> 5733.679
from burdens that you're taking on but

5733.119 --> 5736.48
there will

5733.679 --> 5738.96
be more and then after those burdens

5736.48 --> 5742.0
there will be more so if you think it's

5738.96 --> 5745.679
just this well then you can forget it

5742.0 --> 5745.679
because there's always more

5745.92 --> 5749.84
there's no end to it there's no end to

5748.4 --> 5752.5599999999995
it one way

5749.84 --> 5752.56
or the other

5753.199 --> 5757.839999999999
always more

5760.48 --> 5764.718999999999
because when it seems like there isn't

5762.8 --> 5768.159000000001
more

5764.719 --> 5771.52
then the inability to see

5768.159 --> 5775.119
more becomes the burden

5771.52 --> 5778.159000000001
the burden of test drop it off again

5775.119 --> 5782.639
when there absolutely will be more

5778.159 --> 5782.638999999999
except it's more risky it will be

5782.84 --> 5787.679
concealed

5784.239 --> 5790.159
in order to discourage you

5787.679 --> 5792.4
see because every time you hit you think

5790.159 --> 5794.879999999999
you hit a ceiling it's almost like a

5792.4 --> 5796.5599999999995
intuitive start sign like oh that's it

5794.88 --> 5799.36
so now i can go back

5796.56 --> 5800.96
back to the beginning again start over

5799.36 --> 5803.679
again

5800.96 --> 5803.679
recede

5804.239 --> 5810.0
well there will be many ceilings

5807.52 --> 5813.84
that are not really there they just seem

5810.0 --> 5813.84
to be there

5815.6 --> 5819.4400000000005
they're just there seemingly to prevent

5819.119 --> 5827.5199999999995
you

5819.44 --> 5841.839999999999
from continuing the growth

5827.52 --> 5841.84
what's going on

5849.28 --> 5852.719
when global construct filters into your

5852.159 --> 5856.48
home

5852.719 --> 5856.4800000000005
it's a hard lesson what

5857.119 --> 5865.759999999999
anyway yeah i'll be back

5860.4 --> 5865.759999999999
two minutes can innocence be regained

5866.639 --> 5869.84
or can it be lost

5876.639 --> 5884.639
no look can innocence be taken

5880.88 --> 5886.639
or can it only be discarded

5884.639 --> 5888.4800000000005
once you discard it and you lose the

5886.639 --> 5890.8
senses that are

5888.48 --> 5892.718999999999
that correlate with it then i don't

5890.8 --> 5893.92
think you can retake it because you

5892.719 --> 5897.199
discarded it you

5893.92 --> 5899.4400000000005
chose to abandon it the innocence

5897.199 --> 5901.678999999999
but if your innocence if it's if it's

5899.44 --> 5905.5199999999995
just being hurt

5901.679 --> 5908.32
then in a way you can

5905.52 --> 5910.639
try to get through it get over it maybe

5908.32 --> 5913.759999999999
even find peace again

5910.639 --> 5916.32
but the innocence

5913.76 --> 5917.84
can still be there it's it's a matter of

5916.32 --> 5922.0
perspective like what is it

5917.84 --> 5922.0
really what is innocence

5922.4 --> 5926.719
in a way innocence is a is a choice

5927.199 --> 5930.5599999999995
but yeah maybe getting a little

5928.8 --> 5933.119000000001
philosophical anyway

5930.56 --> 5934.159000000001

6204.4 --> 6211.119
pretty as hot as you can handle it just

6207.679 --> 6213.28
keep on yeah ramming that water stream

6211.119 --> 6214.48
like directly on the right muscles and

6213.28 --> 6217.44
keep aiming it

6214.48 --> 6219.44
it it kind of works for me it worked for

6217.44 --> 6222.159
me

6219.44 --> 6223.44
so you could you try that as well if you

6222.159 --> 6226.719
have nobody that can

6223.44 --> 6229.919999999999
actually apply massage

6226.719 --> 6232.96
or a heat pack right but

6229.92 --> 6236.56
usually a lot of heat does good also

6232.96 --> 6239.52
i'd go for things like chili pepper

6236.56 --> 6240.4800000000005
you could even like apply it topically

6239.52 --> 6243.76
be careful though

6240.48 --> 6246.48
you don't have any open wounds that can

6243.76 --> 6248.320000000001
be painful

6246.48 --> 6249.839999999999
because it gets the blood flowing the

6248.32 --> 6254.5599999999995
blood flowing is really

6249.84 --> 6260.8
a key component into getting rid of the

6254.56 --> 6264.88
like the tighten up muscles

6260.8 --> 6267.28
my heat and blood flow

6264.88 --> 6267.28
anyway

6271.36 --> 6275.839999999999
right 15 minutes more to go

6284.8 --> 6291.6
right also if you have an issue with

6288.4 --> 6293.839999999999
you have trouble letting go the muscle i

6291.6 --> 6294.96
i try to cut down on the coffee

6293.84 --> 6297.28
specifically

6294.96 --> 6300.2390000000005
because i sometimes have it when i drink

6297.28 --> 6300.239
too much coffee

6300.88 --> 6305.28
stopping the coffee it helps

6306.639 --> 6314.719
stop the forced tightening

6311.119 --> 6317.599999999999
spits out coffee ah well there you go

6314.719 --> 6319.119
this is well i'm not telling you not to

6317.6 --> 6322.159000000001
enjoy the coffee just

6319.119 --> 6323.28
cut down on it because more coffee you

6322.159 --> 6327.839999999999
drink the more

6323.28 --> 6329.5199999999995
typical muscle spasm situations i get

6327.84 --> 6333.1990000000005
and you might be having the similar

6329.52 --> 6333.1990000000005
problem that's why i don't drink much

6342.84 --> 6347.63
coffee

6344.46 --> 6347.63
[Music]

6349.04 --> 6354.0
everybody gets into that it's just your

6351.679 --> 6359.84
role in there and you just need to

6354.0 --> 6359.84
wake up from it for a moment

6368.239 --> 6374.48
it's kind of funny because sort of

6371.36 --> 6376.32
back in the day when yeah i was still

6374.48 --> 6377.759999999999
living with my parents and my brother

6376.32 --> 6380.88
was there and all that

6377.76 --> 6382.88
we kind of did this sort of thing like

6380.88 --> 6385.28
people would start to talk about

6382.88 --> 6388.32
what they had and then everybody just

6385.28 --> 6391.679
tried to think of a solution somehow

6388.32 --> 6392.4
my mother for example would often dive

6391.679 --> 6395.36
into

6392.4 --> 6396.08
a herb book to figure out if there was

6395.36 --> 6398.48
something

6396.08 --> 6401.84
that could be tried and we tried a lot

6398.48 --> 6401.839999999999
of these types of things

6402.639 --> 6406.0
it's for me that's kind of what you do

6404.96 --> 6409.36
as a family

6406.0 --> 6411.679
it's like somebody's just like oh i got

6409.36 --> 6414.159
this problem and then everybody just

6411.679 --> 6414.88
helps figure out why it is there and

6414.159 --> 6418.4
then just

6414.88 --> 6418.400000000001
find a solution and help out

6420.0 --> 6425.44
like let the family be your doctor

6423.44 --> 6428.4
like the entire family not just one

6425.44 --> 6431.119
person in a family

6428.4 --> 6434.239
so that everybody gets makes a habit of

6431.119 --> 6436.639
trying to figure out how to deal with

6434.239 --> 6440.0
physical problems or psychological

6436.639 --> 6440.0
problems but that's a little bit more

6440.84 --> 6445.52
complicated

6442.96 --> 6446.2390000000005
but that way it at least it gets

6445.52 --> 6449.119000000001
addressed

6446.239 --> 6450.32
and when you constantly address it

6449.119 --> 6453.119
especially

6450.32 --> 6454.48
starting out young then you don't start

6453.119 --> 6458.32
making a habit of

6454.48 --> 6459.919999999999
hiding it because when you start to make

6458.32 --> 6461.04
a habit of hiding it because it's

6459.92 --> 6464.08
considered as a

6461.04 --> 6467.6
weakness socially then you can

6464.08 --> 6469.36
just drag around all kinds of problems

6467.6 --> 6471.280000000001
throughout your life that you just not

6469.36 --> 6473.679
used to sharing and you're just like

6471.28 --> 6475.599999999999
used to ignoring or pretending it's not

6473.679 --> 6477.4400000000005
there because it's like an intuitive

6475.6 --> 6478.8
kind of weakness socially

6477.44 --> 6480.799999999999
and then you can build up like

6478.8 --> 6484.400000000001
incredible problems like that

6480.8 --> 6486.8
in later in life so i'm just very glad i

6484.4 --> 6489.04
early in got the habit of just being

6486.8 --> 6490.56
relatively open about the issues and

6489.04 --> 6492.239
trying to work them out because that's

6490.56 --> 6496.719
why i'm now

6492.239 --> 6502.08
40 and i still feel almost 41 by the way

6496.719 --> 6502.08
i feel almost like i yeah this is still

6503.04 --> 6509.04
20 years old level maybe 25

6506.08 --> 6509.04
somewhere over there

6509.84 --> 6514.4800000000005
because i've just taken very meticulous

6512.32 --> 6515.92
care of my body and trying to figure out

6514.48 --> 6519.199
how it works

6515.92 --> 6519.1990000000005
how it works with others

6520.4 --> 6524.239
dr are we natural healer yeah i try to

6523.199 --> 6527.44
be

6524.239 --> 6529.28
as much as i can and i'm

6527.44 --> 6530.5599999999995
pretty confident that i can cover

6529.28 --> 6534.0
whatever is needed

6530.56 --> 6536.2390000000005
bar like yeah extreme

6534.0 --> 6538.88
accident situations or whatever but i

6536.239 --> 6541.839999999999
don't i tend not to get into those

6538.88 --> 6541.84
ever

6549.239 --> 6555.839999999999
right no iron 26

6552.84 --> 6555.84
no

6561.76 --> 6569.84
that's absolute nonsense

6570.4 --> 6574.239
you'll see no no you start dying when

6573.36 --> 6576.0
you're born

6574.239 --> 6578.5599999999995
and that just keeps on going until

6576.0 --> 6578.56
you're dead

6581.52 --> 6586.96
that there is no magical moment position

6584.96 --> 6588.0
in your life when that happens it's

6586.96 --> 6591.199
different forever

6588.0 --> 6594.719
sometimes people suddenly get older

6591.199 --> 6594.719
and sometimes they don't

6595.599 --> 6600.88
now because of my genetic background

6599.119 --> 6602.48
i'm pretty convinced that that's not

6600.88 --> 6605.1990000000005
really going to happen to me

6602.48 --> 6606.159
like that not at least not overnight

6605.199 --> 6609.598999999999
didn't happen

6606.159 --> 6613.28
overnight to my dad either still

6609.599 --> 6615.04
looks pretty damn young for his age

6613.28 --> 6616.96
and i don't think it's gonna happen to

6615.04 --> 6619.679
me either nothing like that

6616.96 --> 6622.2390000000005
actually happened to my mother although

6619.679 --> 6625.28
she did go through a transformation

6622.239 --> 6625.678999999999
because of just the the terrible amounts

6625.28 --> 6627.44
of

6625.679 --> 6630.32
medication and everything that she was

6627.44 --> 6632.799999999999
taking and just going nuts

6630.32 --> 6634.239
that was directly the cause of it it's

6632.8 --> 6636.8
just obvious

6634.239 --> 6639.36
so there's no inherent type of thing

6636.8 --> 6642.400000000001
where i'm just suddenly gonna grow older

6639.36 --> 6642.4
other people do

6642.719 --> 6646.32
but it's also the people that i've seen

6645.36 --> 6648.719
that happen to

6646.32 --> 6650.32
that just suddenly get older those are

6648.719 --> 6653.84
the people that

6650.32 --> 6656.159
have very little grip

6653.84 --> 6658.159000000001
over their own situation that just let

6656.159 --> 6659.36
everything happen that just go along

6658.159 --> 6661.28
with things

6659.36 --> 6663.36
those are the people that i've seen that

6661.28 --> 6667.84
just suddenly

6663.36 --> 6667.839999999999
seem to grow older

6668.08 --> 6673.199
and yeah i knew one of these like a

6670.239 --> 6673.199
former roommate

6673.44 --> 6678.08
not my cousin's brother's former

6675.199 --> 6680.719
roommate but just my former roommate

6678.08 --> 6682.159
was like that he's like a nurse in the

6680.719 --> 6685.44
medical system

6682.159 --> 6687.5199999999995
and he's a really awesome guy really

6685.44 --> 6688.48
easy going but a little bit too easy

6687.52 --> 6692.56
going

6688.48 --> 6695.678999999999
and he was like he should be like 30 now

6692.56 --> 6698.96
and even when he was like 28 27

6695.679 --> 6701.36
he had like a lot of gray hair

6698.96 --> 6702.88
no no balding or anything but just a lot

6701.36 --> 6705.759999999999
of gray hair it's just like

6702.88 --> 6705.76
getting older

6706.0 --> 6711.44
well it's because yeah

6709.599 --> 6713.04
that's just because of the way he is

6711.44 --> 6714.32
because he literally just takes

6713.04 --> 6718.96
everything

6714.32 --> 6718.96
takes on everything and

6720.239 --> 6723.678999999999
didn't have a lot of focus of

6721.84 --> 6724.88
maintaining himself just taking

6723.679 --> 6728.4800000000005
everything

6724.88 --> 6728.4800000000005
and that makes you old i think

6730.239 --> 6738.799999999999
the average life expectancy for an elf

6734.159 --> 6742.96
oh that depends i'm not i'm a half elf

6738.8 --> 6746.639
so i don't know could be 200 years

6742.96 --> 6750.2390000000005
200 years is my main goal

6746.639 --> 6752.719
but it's probably going to be 120 or

6750.239 --> 6754.159
80 if i'm unlucky or if the world is

6752.719 --> 6758.32
completely [ __ ]

6754.159 --> 6758.32
like 50. i don't know

6758.56 --> 6764.080000000001
but if the world allows it i could

6760.32 --> 6767.28
become incredibly old i think

6764.08 --> 6768.159
because i did kind of arrange my life to

6767.28 --> 6773.119
be

6768.159 --> 6776.638999999999
like that very careful

6773.119 --> 6779.119
after a certain point and never went

6776.639 --> 6780.719
extremely over borders never went into

6779.119 --> 6782.4
like i'm going to do this because i want

6780.719 --> 6786.159
to try even if it could

6782.4 --> 6786.159
kill me never

6790.8 --> 6797.119000000001
so yeah 180 who knows

6794.08 --> 6802.239
who knows if people will

6797.119 --> 6802.239
allow me to there isn't some freaky

6802.639 --> 6806.88
like mentality by that time where

6804.639 --> 6808.96
everybody's going to be like oh yeah

6806.88 --> 6810.32
the eugenicists are now starting a

6808.96 --> 6813.76
culture

6810.32 --> 6817.04
where you're just not allowed to live

6813.76 --> 6819.4400000000005
longer than 60 years

6817.04 --> 6821.36
just saying no no it's socially

6819.44 --> 6823.919999999999
irresponsible

6821.36 --> 6824.96
to not commit suicide after 50. they

6823.92 --> 6827.1990000000005
might

6824.96 --> 6828.4800000000005
pull that [ __ ] so by the time i actually

6827.199 --> 6830.5599999999995
do get older

6828.48 --> 6834.799999999999
people will suddenly start to shame for

6830.56 --> 6838.2390000000005
me like how dare you not kill yourself

6834.8 --> 6840.719
yeah that time may come people that time

6838.239 --> 6842.08
may actually come it sounds totally

6840.719 --> 6845.28
insane

6842.08 --> 6848.32
science fiction level star trekkie

6845.28 --> 6850.8
futurist blah blah blah the time machine

6848.32 --> 6852.5599999999995
whatever it might actually happen within

6850.8 --> 6854.88
our lifetimes

6852.56 --> 6855.599
that people are literally going to be

6854.88 --> 6859.04
pointed at

6855.599 --> 6859.52
and shamed for not dying when they're

6859.04 --> 6863.36
old

6859.52 --> 6866.96
like how dare you be old and alive

6863.36 --> 6872.5599999999995
you're greedy serious

6866.96 --> 6872.56
seriously people that may happen at some

6874.84 --> 6877.84
point

6878.159 --> 6881.36
so yeah

6881.679 --> 6886.0
just because you can grow old doesn't

6883.76 --> 6891.84
mean it's going to be easy

6886.0 --> 6891.84
in this world not at all

6908.8 --> 6911.119000000001
hmm

6913.92 --> 6919.84
all right

6921.36 --> 6925.598999999999
i don't know how i'm gonna go i just

6923.92 --> 6928.719
hope that by the time

6925.599 --> 6930.32
that it's time i'll just be over life

6928.719 --> 6933.44
enough that it's not going to be an

6930.32 --> 6935.759999999999
issue to me

6933.44 --> 6937.04
that's my hope because it's been very

6935.76 --> 6940.320000000001
like seriously

6937.04 --> 6943.28
my longing for life when i was young was

6940.32 --> 6943.28
so extreme

6943.36 --> 6950.4
like i was obsessed

6947.36 --> 6952.719
with staying alive and even with the

6950.4 --> 6954.48
prospect of potential immortality and

6952.719 --> 6956.4800000000005
eternal youth

6954.48 --> 6958.718999999999
literally i was kind of obsessed with

6956.48 --> 6960.239
that when i was younger became obsessed

6958.719 --> 6962.88
with that now of course there's a lot of

6960.239 --> 6966.0
confrontation with it

6962.88 --> 6969.119
through media sci-fi and all that

6966.0 --> 6973.199
but i was very much into that not

6969.119 --> 6973.199
realizing what it actually means

6973.679 --> 6979.76
but i've learned since then also through

6975.599 --> 6979.76
my dad that it's really all about

6980.4 --> 6983.92
when you grow older that you just that

6983.119 --> 6987.598999999999
the need

6983.92 --> 6991.92
to stay alive just naturally

6987.599 --> 6994.719
recedes and is replaced by wisdom

6991.92 --> 6996.8
so that when you're really old it just

6994.719 --> 6998.32
doesn't matter to you anymore whether

6996.8 --> 7003.84
you die or not

6998.32 --> 7003.84
and that's the best place to go

7006.159 --> 7009.92
but that as an idea was just completely

7009.04 --> 7013.199
insane to me

7009.92 --> 7014.84
say 20 years ago like i was not like

7013.199 --> 7017.199

7057.599 --> 7061.4400000000005
yourself

7058.239 --> 7065.759999999999
really being protective like that

7061.44 --> 7070.719
in a sensible way that just

7065.76 --> 7070.719
