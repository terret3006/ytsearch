42.43 --> 44.49
you

58.63 --> 63.160000000000004
good

60.55 --> 66.1
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

63.16 --> 68.17
number 363 I'm your host

66.1 --> 69.97
Arwen and before start show please don't

68.17 --> 71.8
forget to share it on any platform you

69.97 --> 74.35
deem fit and also if you haven't already

71.8 --> 75.97
subscribed to my channel and hit the

74.35 --> 77.58999999999999
bell notification so you know when I'm

75.97 --> 80.40899999999999
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

77.59 --> 82.3
amsterdam time every day and please also

80.409 --> 85.24000000000001
do support me and my channel through the

82.3 --> 86.259
paypal patreon my GoFundMe that would be

85.24 --> 90.28
much appreciated

86.259 --> 91.979
super chats are also welcome so yeah

90.28 --> 95.44
welcome back everyone

91.979 --> 102.52
it's been a long weekends without early

95.44 --> 107.17
bird shows weather today is kind of gray

102.52 --> 109.979
it's not raining it's yeah there's a

107.17 --> 117.0
live wind but not a lot sometimes and

109.979 --> 117.0
it's just too big great soup out there

119.22 --> 142.49
yep and yeah it is but still fresh so

136.35 --> 150.29999999999998
today with me I have Tamera coffee tea

142.49 --> 152.34
and in the Illuminati class all looking

150.3 --> 164.46
forward to that it's also my breakfast

152.34 --> 170.48000000000002
actually yeah let's see yeah I'm a bit

164.46 --> 170.48000000000002
flustered here I need to reorient myself

174.65 --> 181.1
hey Amanda young good morning it's been

178.41 --> 183.63
boring with it was boring without you

181.1 --> 185.26999999999998
glad I'm back well thank you Amanda

183.63 --> 189.12
young glad you're back as well

185.27 --> 193.08
and besides well you did get the the two

189.12 --> 196.11
after shows from Friday on Saturday and

193.08 --> 200.36
on Sunday in two bits and it was active

196.11 --> 200.36
on that so he at least got a little me

204.43 --> 216.269
let's see who isn't jet I think a gem

212.079 --> 222.28
was first and then Tom Parker over Mukul

216.269 --> 223.959
Giulio Pavan mark colored the one see

222.28 --> 232.29
you again sleeping warrior of course and

223.959 --> 232.29
great hangout by the way was interesting

236.489 --> 251.12900000000002
George Sanford then Winfield built pop

241.76 --> 260.25
digital demonic Davros hellooo they have

251.129 --> 262.919
Lex yes for sure with a container well

260.25 --> 265.38
simple you have two container and then

262.919 --> 267.50899999999996
you have gas and then it spreads out

265.38 --> 270.36
within the container until it found this

267.509 --> 275.37
gas pressure equilibrium gradient at all

270.36 --> 279.02000000000004
and that is how you can have gas

275.37 --> 281.84000000000003
pressure with the container to flex

279.02 --> 286.34
Kamikaze Gilmore's also here James Mason

281.84 --> 286.34
gotta kill the Hope Mountain Dew

294.189 --> 301.569
yeah I was also inserting a few words

298.479 --> 308.649
over at Del's what's that Friday I think

301.569 --> 310.839
so I'm not too sure Darkman yeah I think

308.649 --> 312.899
I got everyone know so yeah good to see

310.839 --> 317.669
Bill G almost missed you there

312.899 --> 321.309
good to see you all Major Tom

317.669 --> 324.959
indeed dae-jung the world is flat by the

321.309 --> 324.959
way the earth

326.3 --> 329.389
[Music]

331.6 --> 335.72
[Music]

345.93 --> 350.25
while Tom Parker the jet fuel fuel hugs

349.08 --> 354.06
you have to be a little bit more

350.25 --> 356.449
specific but if it concerns that big

354.06 --> 362.49
Jets may actually be using engines that

356.449 --> 366.12
require very little fossil fuels to keep

362.49 --> 369.259
on running then yeah I think there's

366.12 --> 369.259
something to that but

387.28 --> 394.46999999999997
oh really more in heavens that is

389.98 --> 397.47
Pascal's law there's no gradient

394.47 --> 397.47
really

402.92 --> 411.819
[Music]

422.149 --> 431.759
no no that absolutely does not disprove

428.399 --> 434.419
a gradient within a container it's

431.759 --> 434.41900000000004
ridiculous

436.62 --> 439.779
[Music]

442.62 --> 450.95
the gradients are dependent on the

447.6 --> 453.6
overall volume available to the

450.95 --> 456.93
separated container in order for a

453.6 --> 459.66
gradient to to manifest if it's too

456.93 --> 462.21
small and say there's a lot of high

459.66 --> 465.36
pressure going on then the gradient will

462.21 --> 467.78999999999996
be so minut it will probably be barely

465.36 --> 470.40000000000003
measurable if at all doesn't mean that

467.79 --> 472.55
it's not there there's a gradient within

470.4 --> 475.56
the container of this realm and

472.55 --> 478.95
everything else that is within the realm

475.56 --> 482.52
if it has a fluid within it there will

478.95 --> 486.0
also be a gradient in a similar pattern

482.52 --> 491.78999999999996
so the one gradient of one container

486.0 --> 500.67
adapts to the overall gradient pattern

491.79 --> 505.82
within the total container good morning

500.67 --> 505.82
sorry to Cosentino but then saw banded

506.72 --> 513.26
John Wayne Oh Peter Harrington

517.16 --> 524.67
good servant right yeah definitely still

523.08 --> 527.09
need to container that's correct good

524.67 --> 527.0899999999999
servant

533.63 --> 540.319
right yeah Warren Evans but again I hope

537.11 --> 543.6990000000001
you caught that what I said about it yes

540.319 --> 546.9799999999999
the press if the pressure on the entire

543.699 --> 550.069
container increases then that pressure

546.98 --> 556.5790000000001
will be transmitted that's correct

550.069 --> 559.31
it doesn't undo the gradient effect from

556.579 --> 562.4899999999999
forming within the gas pressure system

559.31 --> 567.1099999999999
if it has a chance to settle if it has a

562.49 --> 570.47
chance to find an equilibrium but yeah

567.11 --> 573.92
Pascal's lost mostly about like if you

570.47 --> 576.35
change pressure on one side then it's

573.92 --> 579.29
gonna transfer that pressure within the

576.35 --> 581.36
complete container that's what it seems

579.29 --> 585.519
to be about mostly when I look up

581.36 --> 593.38
Pascal's law in Wikipedia it does not

585.519 --> 597.889
say there cannot be a gradient because

593.38 --> 599.8389999999999
it is about how pressure transfer when

597.889 --> 603.62
the pressure within the container is

599.839 --> 608.8100000000001
changed the total container pressure of

603.62 --> 611.079
the thing yeah being done that's what

608.81 --> 611.079
it's about

617.17 --> 633.37
what it's a gas pressure Ragnar Stefan

631.12 --> 638.23
Alderson atmospheric is gas pressure

633.37 --> 640.74
within our atmosphere within our realms

638.23 --> 640.74
container

642.56 --> 646.06
[Music]

651.67 --> 657.55
no that's not what I said at Ward Evans

655.39 --> 661.93
why don't you listen to what I said okay

657.55 --> 665.92
I'm gonna do people are just so hard

661.93 --> 674.37
hearing I'm just gonna have to show it I

665.92 --> 674.37
guess it's getting kind of ridiculous

675.36 --> 678.36
goody

688.11 --> 698.16
all right so this Pascal's law Pascal's

695.4 --> 700.0699999999999
law is the principle behind hydraulic

698.16 --> 703.5799999999999
lifting and pressure devices right

700.07 --> 706.8000000000001
because it it shows you a pressure

703.58 --> 710.1
within a separated container and then

706.8 --> 713.24
how pressure of one on one side transfer

710.1 --> 716.03
within the pressure of the container and

713.24 --> 719.19
divides it equally

716.03 --> 721.26
that's Pascal's law it doesn't have

719.19 --> 724.4100000000001
anything to do with a container it is

721.26 --> 727.62
about the complete total pressure on the

724.41 --> 730.41
fluids within the container it doesn't

727.62 --> 733.71
say anything about how those fluids

730.41 --> 738.42
settle whether they are perfectly

733.71 --> 745.07
equalized pressure and every point no

738.42 --> 747.39
it's just about the total mechanical

745.07 --> 750.24
transfer of pressure within the

747.39 --> 757.53
container that's what Pascal's law seems

750.24 --> 760.26
to be about change in pressure at any

757.53 --> 762.6
point in an enclosed fluid at rest is

760.26 --> 766.53
transmitted undiminished to all points

762.6 --> 771.03
in the fluid exactly I didn't even read

766.53 --> 772.5899999999999
it I just saw it and the picture here

771.03 --> 777.72
was enough for me to understand what

772.59 --> 781.76
this was about so no it does if you can

777.72 --> 784.2
point at me where it says Pascal's law

781.76 --> 787.71
disproves the gradient

784.2 --> 790.9100000000001
I'd love to see that because I can't

787.71 --> 790.9100000000001
find that here really

807.01 --> 813.38
Wow yeah and at the last part here what

811.58 --> 816.74
I'm seeing right now it's there they're

813.38 --> 819.92
drawing in gravitational [ __ ] so

816.74 --> 824.12
that this is basically Pascal's law this

819.92 --> 827.2099999999999
is it this is the thing and this seems

824.12 --> 831.29
to be speculation [ __ ]

827.21 --> 833.9000000000001
consider yeah concerning the atmosphere

831.29 --> 837.41
pressure so I think they the baller

833.9 --> 839.48
[ __ ] is starting to leak in here it

837.41 --> 849.7099999999999
doesn't really it's just it's even

839.48 --> 854.32
presented as speculation so and they can

849.71 --> 857.27
draw in all kinds of ridiculous things

854.32 --> 860.1500000000001
gravitational explanation for the

857.27 --> 863.81
pressure differential on the earth to

860.15 --> 866.3
slip in the ball [ __ ] but that really

863.81 --> 871.1899999999999
has not a freaking thing to do with

866.3 --> 873.8599999999999
Pascal's law which is pretty direct it's

871.19 --> 876.0500000000001
right here the definition changing

873.86 --> 879.32
pressure at any point in an enclosed

876.05 --> 882.37
fluid at rest rest is transmitted

879.32 --> 886.0600000000001
undiminished to all points in the fluid

882.37 --> 890.21
all right so it's about the transference

886.06 --> 893.54
doesn't say oh look there is a pressure

890.21 --> 895.4300000000001
gradient within the fluid no it doesn't

893.54 --> 903.86
even address that it's not about that

895.43 --> 906.02
it's specific it's very specific they

903.86 --> 908.38
got a mathematical definition or

906.02 --> 908.38
whatever

917.199 --> 923.17
what if Pascal's law is fake really

924.819 --> 934.579
that's okay and you disprove it then you

931.069 --> 936.8
don't like Pascal's law anymore because

934.579 --> 941.2589999999999
it doesn't help you prove your freaking

936.8 --> 945.1099999999999
ball is that the only use really that

941.259 --> 948.139
laws and scientific discoveries have for

945.11 --> 950.3000000000001
you it doesn't prove the ball somehow it

948.139 --> 951.139
can be discarded because it becomes

950.3 --> 952.76
useless

951.139 --> 956.279
is that it

952.76 --> 956.279
[Music]

962.18 --> 967.6289999999999
all right

963.73 --> 970.089
now but Warren Evans I know you want to

967.629 --> 974.109
hear that wasn't in there that's your

970.089 --> 977.35
conclusion that an untested conclusion I

974.109 --> 981.9390000000001
might add right because it doesn't tell

977.35 --> 984.8190000000001
you what the pressure differences within

981.939 --> 987.0999999999999
the body of fluid of that container to

984.819 --> 990.79
which the things are being subjected

987.1 --> 994.809
know that it doesn't say what the

990.79 --> 998.319
pressures are within them so if you can

994.809 --> 1001.799
point at bats within the Pascal's law

998.319 --> 1003.9889999999999
system and not the creating of the

1001.799 --> 1005.579
atmosphere [ __ ] part that comes out

1003.989 --> 1008.22
there and doesn't actually even claim

1005.579 --> 1014.1189999999999
anything just speculation [ __ ] if

1008.22 --> 1014.119
you can point at it tell me and do it

1015.139 --> 1024.24
come on stupid claims your stupid claims

1021.149 --> 1028.939
baller claims just claims you just say

1024.24 --> 1028.939
it is like this you don't have any proof

1030.0 --> 1033.23
[Music]

1035.899 --> 1040.5
yeah if you're gonna troll me you're

1037.829 --> 1042.889
gonna spell my name right next time

1040.5 --> 1042.889
you're banned

1046.25 --> 1052.22
[Music]

1048.7 --> 1058.3600000000001
so Warren Evans you can address that

1052.22 --> 1061.8500000000001
within Pascal's law how the specific

1058.36 --> 1063.9189999999999
Annie called redistribution of pressure

1061.85 --> 1068.269
when exerted on one point within a

1063.919 --> 1070.25
container this spells the effect of a

1068.269 --> 1072.35
gradient of the pressures already

1070.25 --> 1074.69
present within the fluids of the

1072.35 --> 1079.519
container then please be so kind as to

1074.69 --> 1082.88
point me at where it says that okay

1079.519 --> 1086.95
before you start claiming it disproves

1082.88 --> 1086.95
the pressure gradient [ __ ]

1107.98 --> 1112.0
all right more colored

1113.24 --> 1118.57
[Music]

1115.79 --> 1118.57
so

1122.11 --> 1129.1589999999999
yeah just to clear it up a little bit

1124.87 --> 1131.6789999999999
more if you missed out This Is It this

1129.159 --> 1134.409
is the thing what it does it's about

1131.679 --> 1137.769
this little container here and what

1134.409 --> 1141.909
happens with the pressures or the

1137.769 --> 1147.22
equally distributes and here is the

1141.909 --> 1150.3990000000001
definition Pascal's principle it's the

1147.22 --> 1153.279
finest change in a pressure at any point

1150.399 --> 1155.4089999999999
in a enclosed fluid at rest is

1153.279 --> 1160.87
transmitted undiminished to all points

1155.409 --> 1164.409
in the fluid doesn't say it doesn't even

1160.87 --> 1166.87
address what the exact pressures are or

1164.409 --> 1171.279
should be or would be or it doesn't

1166.87 --> 1174.299
address the pressures present within the

1171.279 --> 1176.44
container come yeah the enclosed fluids

1174.299 --> 1179.3799999999999
doesn't address that it just says that

1176.44 --> 1183.76
if you put extra pressure on one point

1179.38 --> 1187.0900000000001
it will equally redistribute doesn't say

1183.76 --> 1190.36
that there is no gradient it just says

1187.09 --> 1194.039
the total pressure increase will

1190.36 --> 1197.35
redistribute so there will be like a new

1194.039 --> 1199.6589999999999
it's like a new entropy effect basically

1197.35 --> 1206.59
it's like the pressure is increased so

1199.659 --> 1210.0390000000002
it immediately transfers out it's about

1206.59 --> 1213.58
settling the new average pressure within

1210.039 --> 1216.75
the container doesn't say there cannot

1213.58 --> 1221.639
be a gradient within the new pressure

1216.75 --> 1221.639
situation doesn't address it

1222.95 --> 1226.1090000000002
[Music]

1232.88 --> 1244.69
okay yeah they got me riled up a bit

1249.39 --> 1257.9
oh really shifted purple you thought

1254.85 --> 1257.8999999999999
that was worth salad

1262.09 --> 1273.1299999999999
so how what what exactly was word salad

1266.19 --> 1275.6200000000001
how did I miss apply the technicals was

1273.13 --> 1278.91
I wrong about something was there a

1275.62 --> 1282.57
direct indication that Pascal's law

1278.91 --> 1285.28
explains exactly what the pressure

1282.57 --> 1287.71
situations within the contained fluid

1285.28 --> 1291.79
must be does it address that did you

1287.71 --> 1295.47
find it word salad did you find it they

1291.79 --> 1299.61
couldn't you find it before you declare

1295.47 --> 1299.6100000000001
what I said word salad

1312.64 --> 1315.919
[Music]

1317.91 --> 1325.03
you don't have anything none of you do

1320.5 --> 1329.88
it's just this stupid game of yours

1325.03 --> 1332.46
constantly getting kind of bored of it

1329.88 --> 1335.65
you know to me it's almost like playing

1332.46 --> 1339.039
civilization 5 I've played that damn

1335.65 --> 1342.429
game so many times it's like every

1339.039 --> 1344.65
single move that is done I just know

1342.429 --> 1348.909
exactly where it's going because I've

1344.65 --> 1350.5900000000001
seen every option what they do so many

1348.909 --> 1352.5390000000002
times because I played that game too

1350.59 --> 1353.98
many times well this with the ballers

1352.539 --> 1358.0
it's kind of turning into it the same

1353.98 --> 1363.52
thing I'm getting kind of tired of just

1358.0 --> 1367.03
seeing how things always happen the

1363.52 --> 1369.34
arguments of the opponents always the

1367.03 --> 1371.9189999999999
same style in the same pattern fully

1369.34 --> 1377.01
automated seemingly so fully fully

1371.919 --> 1380.44
automated very little improvisation even

1377.01 --> 1382.6
present except for the rear oil

1380.44 --> 1386.5900000000001
improvisation overall with the ballers

1382.6 --> 1388.6
lies with how they're gonna paint the

1386.59 --> 1392.74
picture with all the [ __ ] that they

1388.6 --> 1397.6589999999999
got available therein lies some

1392.74 --> 1401.53
creativity but it's just it's the

1397.659 --> 1405.0700000000002
crusting it's the outer shell of the

1401.53 --> 1407.76
entire body of [ __ ] that they sling

1405.07 --> 1407.76
around constantly

1413.09 --> 1424.07
ah or it Evans it's from Wikipedia it is

1420.07 --> 1428.11
it yeah it is I just presented that on

1424.07 --> 1433.6
the screen I know it's from Wikipedia I

1428.11 --> 1437.6299999999999
went through the Wikipedia website and

1433.6 --> 1441.7099999999998
yeah I can present it again if you're

1437.63 --> 1443.89
confused about what happened if you need

1441.71 --> 1443.89
it

1453.26 --> 1456.46
[Music]

1478.96 --> 1486.67
yeah I know Warren Evans if you change

1483.45 --> 1490.0
somewhere within the container of fluids

1486.67 --> 1492.76
if you change the pressure then that

1490.0 --> 1495.49
pressure change will transfer throughout

1492.76 --> 1498.64
the fluid in the entire container that's

1495.49 --> 1502.84
correct technically that would even come

1498.64 --> 1505.8300000000002
for Earth for the earth realm itself for

1502.84 --> 1509.02
some reason something just unleashed a

1505.83 --> 1513.49
hundred thousand tons of compacted air

1509.02 --> 1515.47
yeah the same thing would happen it

1513.49 --> 1518.77
still on a settling a gradient though

1515.47 --> 1521.53
because that happens and Pascal's law

1518.77 --> 1526.86
does not address that doesn't mention

1521.53 --> 1529.3899999999999
about how the pressures within the fluid

1526.86 --> 1532.3899999999999
that were already there how they are

1529.39 --> 1536.1100000000001
arranged what happens to that it just

1532.39 --> 1539.98
addresses the overall pressure within

1536.11 --> 1542.35
the system and how it uniformly changes

1539.98 --> 1544.21
with introduced extra pressure or taking

1542.35 --> 1547.84
away that pressure that's what that's

1544.21 --> 1552.78
about it doesn't address any gradients

1547.84 --> 1552.78
within the fluid body pressure

1558.24 --> 1568.44
that just be not you [ __ ] it doesn't

1564.48 --> 1573.39
say that it's about the pressure

1568.44 --> 1576.39
transfer it's the pressure the

1573.39 --> 1579.0
introduced pressure transformer yeah

1576.39 --> 1580.92
that uniforms the alters depression

1579.0 --> 1585.42
within the fluid container it doesn't

1580.92 --> 1589.41
address any present gradients it doesn't

1585.42 --> 1592.8300000000002
address that that means it's not about

1589.41 --> 1595.8000000000002
that that means it also does not say it

1592.83 --> 1606.26
cannot be because it just doesn't

1595.8 --> 1606.26
address it [ __ ]

1611.02 --> 1617.509
[Music]

1619.44 --> 1631.25
oh my god

1633.8 --> 1647.6699999999998
uniformly means as one right so say a

1644.15 --> 1653.25
family does something uniformly that

1647.67 --> 1654.18
means dad mom teenage kid little kid

1653.25 --> 1656.82
baby

1654.18 --> 1659.76
they all do something as one whatever

1656.82 --> 1661.59
they can they be part of the family they

1659.76 --> 1663.93
do does that mean that they're all

1661.59 --> 1668.54
exactly the same

1663.93 --> 1672.48
height age person they're all uniform no

1668.54 --> 1675.24
doesn't mean that at all it just means

1672.48 --> 1677.46
that they all do something as one it

1675.24 --> 1682.3700000000001
doesn't address that they have to be

1677.46 --> 1682.3700000000001
exactly alike it doesn't address it

1695.17 --> 1698.3490000000002
[Music]

1703.61 --> 1715.6899999999998
I know are in Evans I just told you that

1708.83 --> 1722.6899999999998
I didn't even have to research that in a

1715.69 --> 1727.52
way yeah in a way do you get that in a

1722.69 --> 1733.52
way that means concerning a separate

1727.52 --> 1738.11
thing do you understand that what that

1733.52 --> 1743.8
means that means in a certain things not

1738.11 --> 1745.51
in all things do you understand

1743.8 --> 1750.55
[Music]

1745.51 --> 1750.55
am I getting through to you Warren Evans

1752.04 --> 1755.25
[Music]

1775.05 --> 1780.84
right I think if you're gonna be like

1778.26 --> 1784.61
the top version of that then it wouldn't

1780.84 --> 1790.4099999999999
be uniformly you would call it

1784.61 --> 1793.29
uniformity that's like everybody has to

1790.41 --> 1796.14
be as much the same as possible and then

1793.29 --> 1799.68
you really push that uniformity but

1796.14 --> 1802.14
uniformly is simply concerning a action

1799.68 --> 1803.91
so they're uniformly in one thing

1802.14 --> 1807.8100000000002
they're uniformly going somewhere

1803.91 --> 1811.8600000000001
they're uniformly celebrating something

1807.81 --> 1813.48
it's they're uniformly doing something

1811.86 --> 1816.4199999999998
that doesn't mean that they all have to

1813.48 --> 1821.1
be exactly to say you do realize right

1816.42 --> 1825.8300000000002
that even with Pascal's law say that

1821.1 --> 1829.56
that fluid thing that uniformly changes

1825.83 --> 1832.83
that it's not just one gas or fluid

1829.56 --> 1836.46
maybe it could be a wide variety of

1832.83 --> 1838.4399999999998
different types of mixed-up fluids that

1836.46 --> 1842.72
respond in a very certain way because

1838.44 --> 1845.76
yeah changes the overall body effects

1842.72 --> 1846.9
they become more stable or less

1845.76 --> 1848.73
gradiated

1846.9 --> 1856.47
because it's more mixed up that kind of

1848.73 --> 1859.17
thing right so what then you know if you

1856.47 --> 1860.94
take that that soup of fluids that's

1859.17 --> 1863.4
normally under pressure within that

1860.94 --> 1865.95
thing that device just take it in a

1863.4 --> 1868.95
bucket and leave it there for a very

1865.95 --> 1870.21
very very long time and touched and you

1868.95 --> 1872.76
then like it would have to be

1870.21 --> 1875.04
transparent and then take a look at it

1872.76 --> 1877.41
yeah it's gonna settle ingredients yeah

1875.04 --> 1879.87
that's gonna happen that's right

1877.41 --> 1885.63
probably if it's different types of

1879.87 --> 1891.9499999999998
fluid just very very still but that

1885.63 --> 1896.7
that's because Pascal's law is not about

1891.95 --> 1898.68
the fluid in one part of the fluid in

1896.7 --> 1901.1100000000001
relation to another party it's about the

1898.68 --> 1903.68
overall pressure which is kind of

1901.11 --> 1903.6799999999998
lockstep

1903.94 --> 1909.01
the container however it does mean it

1906.73 --> 1910.93
has to be exactly the same everywhere it

1909.01 --> 1914.23
just means that if there is something

1910.93 --> 1916.72
introduced that changes the pressure of

1914.23 --> 1920.34
that system everything is going to

1916.72 --> 1920.34
change exactly alike

1920.46 --> 1928.81
so say there is for example a container

1923.92 --> 1930.01
with a giant tube on top and there yeah

1928.81 --> 1932.3799999999999
there would probably be a different

1930.01 --> 1934.09
pressure way on top of that then down

1932.38 --> 1937.5100000000002
there if you're gonna introduce more

1934.09 --> 1940.24
pressure then everywhere the pressure is

1937.51 --> 1944.68
gonna increase even at the top but it's

1940.24 --> 1949.27
still gonna be less than the points in

1944.68 --> 1952.48
the fluid container lower but it is

1949.27 --> 1956.08
gonna increase probably you could say

1952.48 --> 1958.48
percentile Y is exactly the same that's

1956.08 --> 1963.6
what Pascal's law is about it does not

1958.48 --> 1963.6
address a gradient within the fluid

1966.64 --> 1969.729
[Music]

1991.43 --> 1995.479
[Music]

1995.7 --> 2003.02
that are really yeah and look at Sperry

1998.73 --> 2005.48
music look at him look at that it's

2003.02 --> 2008.99
wrong to use Pascal's law that is for

2005.48 --> 2011.84
gas pressure in a container atmospheric

2008.99 --> 2017.29
pressure is not the same really sfera

2011.84 --> 2017.29
music is that because you believe ooh

2018.01 --> 2024.17
that the pressure on earth is not within

2022.28 --> 2032.3899999999999
a container is that which you believes

2024.17 --> 2036.89
very music how is that possible can you

2032.39 --> 2039.98
demonstrate how that's possible that bar

2036.89 --> 2041.8700000000001
just claiming it by going outside and

2039.98 --> 2044.1100000000001
pointing at the sky and saying it's a

2041.87 --> 2044.11
vacuum

2052.44 --> 2056.819

2056.039 --> 2058.4700000000003
me a dick

2056.819 --> 2064.169
really you're calling me a dick for

2058.47 --> 2066.5099999999998
calling you out on claiming that those

2064.169 --> 2069.7799999999997
things don't apply to the atmosphere

2066.51 --> 2072.0890000000004
because it is not in a container are you

2069.78 --> 2075.8990000000003
seriously thinking that I'm gonna let

2072.089 --> 2078.859
that go are you seriously you're calling

2075.899 --> 2081.5389999999998
me dick for calling you out on that

2078.859 --> 2084.359
think we haven't looked that up in

2081.539 --> 2086.789
physics study some physics yeah yeah

2084.359 --> 2090.089
yeah you know I did actually do physics

2086.789 --> 2091.71
in school what's quite good at it at the

2090.089 --> 2101.43
time although it's more than 20 years

2091.71 --> 2105.77
ago and yeah great fan of it so yeah

2101.43 --> 2105.77
that's the last time dart man piss off

2112.8 --> 2115.94
and you too

2117.62 --> 2124.74
I'm calling you a dick for your behavior

2120.68 --> 2127.47
not for calling me out really what why

2124.74 --> 2129.87
my dick that makes no sense

2127.47 --> 2133.37
can somebody in chat please address

2129.87 --> 2137.81
Sparrow music because this is like

2133.37 --> 2140.46
getting confusing even to me because

2137.81 --> 2153.7799999999997
starting to make very little sense to me

2140.46 --> 2156.36
what he's saying my behavior well what

2153.78 --> 2158.9700000000003
might what's my behavior exactly getting

2156.36 --> 2162.92
more loud getting pissed off does that

2158.97 --> 2165.66
make me a dick did I humiliate somebody

2162.92 --> 2167.31
undeservedly did i peer pressure

2165.66 --> 2174.02
somebody to them try to manipulate

2167.31 --> 2174.02
anybody why am i dick why what did i do

2174.74 --> 2179.1299999999997
yeah that's very funny

2176.94 --> 2181.17
oh yeah we're all I'll see uh no but

2179.13 --> 2182.4
still I want to know why you called me

2181.17 --> 2191.1
that because I don't think I deserve

2182.4 --> 2193.25
that at all I'm just gonna brush over

2191.1 --> 2193.25
that

2197.73 --> 2200.889

2201.25 --> 2214.89

2204.31 --> 2214.89

freakin baller room for a bunch of kids

2243.609 --> 2249.0099999999998
to hang around and misbehave like a

2260.829 --> 2267.92

2264.17 --> 2271.48
knowing you on this channel it's over

I'm not gonna take that kind of [ __ ] you

2289.31 --> 2296.93
know people are gonna insult me and then

2291.829 --> 2299.3
try to no no no I don't want to just

2296.93 --> 2303.0789999999997
outright ban you because I want to give

2299.3 --> 2305.03
you a chance to either be humiliated by

2303.079 --> 2307.1600000000003
your own disgusting behavior and your

2305.03 --> 2314.21
blind insults that literally have no

2307.16 --> 2317.0299999999997
foundation or whatever just I want to

2314.21 --> 2319.19
see you squirm for a bit before I ban

2317.03 --> 2321.98
you when you start to behave like this

2319.19 --> 2325.099
because I'm just so sick of people

2321.98 --> 2330.099
thinking that that's okay to do that

2325.099 --> 2330.099
it's not it's not okay to do that ever

2330.94 --> 2338.869
this behavior just makes me hate

2334.91 --> 2342.02
humanity in general because people just

2338.869 --> 2354.02
allow themselves to do that [ __ ] and

2342.02 --> 2357.13
think it's alright no it's not take what

2354.02 --> 2357.13
from Nathan Oakley

2361.71 --> 2365.46
everything I take from Nathan Oakley I

2364.079 --> 2369.63
give it right back

2365.46 --> 2372.48
you know that as well as I do but it's

2369.63 --> 2375.96
his show you know I can't try to break

2372.48 --> 2379.17
his show I'm not gonna be just like the

2375.96 --> 2381.599
absolutely [ __ ] ballers that think

2379.17 --> 2385.619
that they can take over the show because

2381.599 --> 2390.809
of some justification or nothing was

2385.619 --> 2392.9100000000003
mean or he didn't want to allow somebody

2390.809 --> 2399.0
to finish their presuppositional

2392.91 --> 2407.97
nonsense speculation assertions oh yeah

2399.0 --> 2411.079
makes him so mean no yeah that's right

2407.97 --> 2414.6899999999996
Warren Evans because sometimes I do

2411.079 --> 2417.9300000000003
overstep the line a bit and then on the

2414.69 --> 2420.569
other hand sometimes they'd like to take

2417.93 --> 2424.2599999999998
my grace a little bit too for granted

2420.569 --> 2430.349
and then I don't just accept that kind

2424.26 --> 2433.1400000000003
of [ __ ] so it's a bit of a game but the

2430.349 --> 2435.6600000000003

2473.039 --> 2478.26
retraction of your previous idiotic

2475.829 --> 2480.599
statement where you claim that Pascal's

2478.26 --> 2484.039
law disproves a gradient maybe you'd

2480.599 --> 2487.6090000000004
like to apologize for your stupidity and

2484.039 --> 2487.6090000000004

pressure locally within the fluid

2561.99 --> 2569.91
container at all does not address it

2565.11 --> 2572.3900000000003
just the uniform change within the fluid

2569.91 --> 2572.39
container

admit that Pascal's law has nothing to

2684.359 --> 2690.0299999999997
do with a freakin pressure gradient

2687.78 --> 2692.1600000000003

ah yeah

3182.829 --> 3191.2400000000002
and it was inevitable but it also

3186.71 --> 3193.779
happened because yeah this weekend in my

3191.24 --> 3198.2599999999998
own way I got subjected to some unusual

3193.779 --> 3200.809
pressure social pressure in ways and I

3198.26 --> 3203.7690000000002
had to be tolerant because these people

3200.809 --> 3209.75
are my real face-to-face friends and I

3203.769 --> 3212.5099999999998
like have to invest in my relation no

3209.75 --> 3216.049
matter how tough that is in a way and

3212.51 --> 3217.67
then I realized something as I was doing

3216.049 --> 3219.279
that I Oh as I was going through it do

3217.67 --> 3223.76
you know what I realized

3219.279 --> 3226.069
what the hell any person could probably

3223.76 --> 3227.9300000000003
take that if they prevented themselves

3226.069 --> 3230.42
from having some kind of bad neurotic

3227.93 --> 3230.8089999999997
response against their socially I can do

3230.42 --> 3233.809
that

3230.809 --> 3237.26
why am i having so much trouble taking

3233.809 --> 3239.539
that pressure why is that in social

3237.26 --> 3243.559
internet why is it so tough on me why am

3239.539 --> 3248.509
i miserable it's because of the [ __ ]

3243.559 --> 3252.619
ballers that [ __ ] that's just did the

3248.509 --> 3255.65
layer of [ __ ] that just sticks and drags

3252.619 --> 3264.6400000000003
me down overall and and my empathic

3255.65 --> 3268.7000000000003
abilities can't separate it I I can't I

3264.64 --> 3272.6299999999997
cannot not let it touch me in a way even

3268.7 --> 3276.1899999999996
though I can act very well that I can at

3272.63 --> 3279.98
a time the pressure still builds and

3276.19 --> 3281.509
yeah then I noticed wow I'm real active

3279.98 --> 3283.309
flat earther you know I'm taking this

3281.509 --> 3287.839
[ __ ] seriously I'm going full ahead I'm

3283.309 --> 3291.529
not backing down but Jesus Christ I have

3287.839 --> 3293.45
almost no life social wise partially

3291.529 --> 3296.21
because of this [ __ ] and I took it on

3293.45 --> 3301.279
kind of because already I'm not very

3296.21 --> 3303.859
socially active by Nature so I took this

3301.279 --> 3305.9
make it even harder and now I'm here and

3303.859 --> 3308.93
I'm having even more trouble connecting

3305.9 --> 3311.0
to people that's just freakin great and

3308.93 --> 3313.0389999999998
it's not because they believe in Flat

3311.0 --> 3315.21
Earth it's because I have to deal with

3313.039 --> 3319.349
freaking demonic

3315.21 --> 3322.17
reiax whole hordes of them on a daily

3319.349 --> 3326.3

people that continue doubling down

3504.0 --> 3512.14
constantly on of his lies create more

3509.35 --> 3513.79
lies in between them to cover for other

3545.83 --> 3554.2

3554.2 --> 3558.8199999999997
seeming absolutely real and a

3556.75 --> 3561.15
possibility for the future now I'm not

3558.82 --> 3561.15
gonna do that

3563.19 --> 3570.88
so yeah sorry if I offended any

3568.03 --> 3572.6800000000003
newcomers it was never meant to address

3570.88 --> 3575.4100000000003
the newcomers there's a lot of just

3572.68 --> 3576.85
general people that get to know me and

3575.41 --> 3579.31
then they see oh my god why does he

3576.85 --> 3583.0299999999997
ranting being so pissed off and calling

3579.31 --> 3585.19
people demons or it's really only meant

3583.03 --> 3588.61
for the people that I really like that

3585.19 --> 3592.65
and we can prove that we have even

3588.61 --> 3596.65
proven that the more prolific people

3592.65 --> 3601.03
that do that but it's very self evident

3596.65 --> 3603.1
really all this behavior so if you got a

3601.03 --> 3605.11
little start all about the anger then

3603.1 --> 3608.3199999999997
yeah don't necessarily take it

3605.11 --> 3609.07
personally it's only when you've gone

3608.32 --> 3614.71
over the edge

3609.07 --> 3616.27
that was meant for you so yeah I will be

3614.71 --> 3622.2400000000002
