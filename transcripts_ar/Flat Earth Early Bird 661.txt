it's very freaking hot

103.84 --> 110.479
it's even hotter than yesterday i think

107.68 --> 110.47900000000001
let me check it

111.439 --> 115.83999999999999
but uh yeah

116.399 --> 123.2
it's a bit of a haze up there again

119.92 --> 126.0
trail remnants maybe

123.2 --> 126.64
and but it's just hot there's not a lot

126.0 --> 128.64
of wind

126.64 --> 131.92
and it's really cooking outside i was

128.64 --> 131.92
like cooked out of my bed

132.72 --> 144.48
again this morning

142.4 --> 145.68
good thing i didn't make it too late

144.48 --> 148.16
yesterday but

145.68 --> 150.0
it wasn't very early either so yeah i

148.16 --> 151.76
gotta keep this in mind if this keeps

150.0 --> 157.84
going i'm gonna have to really go to bed

151.76 --> 160.0
early again

157.84 --> 162.879
but it kept hanging around several

160.0 --> 162.879
streams going on

166.08 --> 172.4
spill bosses out and yeah

170.239 --> 174.64000000000001
oh i bet it's pretty hot over there as

172.4 --> 174.64000000000001
well

175.04 --> 182.239
anyway hey all right good servant

178.64 --> 185.04
first in chat roger is there

182.239 --> 187.44
you go playing an anchor stopping

185.04 --> 190.239
traffic in my rest ahead

187.44 --> 190.239
chewy sticks

194.319 --> 202.07999999999998
yeah exactly okay i yeah

199.04 --> 203.599
indeed but i did follow it from

202.08 --> 206.31900000000002
beginning to end pretty much

203.599 --> 209.599
and it was it wasn't like i was

206.319 --> 212.64
listening a lot of the time

209.599 --> 214.319
i wasn't saying too much some parts i

212.64 --> 217.44
was active in chat

214.319 --> 219.67999999999998
but yeah i was good you know his

217.44 --> 220.879
space crack episodes are always very

219.68 --> 227.84
interesting

220.879 --> 227.84
it brings out all kinds of footage

229.92 --> 236.48
right yeah also uh own benjamin was also

234.159 --> 239.599
alive by the way

236.48 --> 240.72
he was yeah the theme was dune in this

239.599 --> 245.67999999999998
case it was very

240.72 --> 247.76
interesting like the other correlations

245.68 --> 251.04000000000002
in the story that i've seen like with

247.76 --> 254.39999999999998
the iraq situation and all that

251.04 --> 257.44
in afghanistan like i said i saw that

254.4 --> 260.799
even like 20 years ago

257.44 --> 260.799
it was very fascinating

261.919 --> 267.03999999999996
and yeah big bear

265.36 --> 268.72
put some other correlations with the

267.04 --> 272.08000000000004
benefit

268.72 --> 276.16
and the and the jesuits

272.08 --> 279.03999999999996
female form and yeah

276.16 --> 280.56
the pain box got a lot of attention and

279.04 --> 283.84000000000003
it's a good one because

280.56 --> 283.84
it's a very important lesson

292.08 --> 296.0
so yeah it was a good show yeah i

294.24 --> 297.84000000000003
remembered most of it well because the

296.0 --> 299.919
theme is very

297.84 --> 300.88
i like that i like dune i like the

299.919 --> 303.28
series dune

300.88 --> 303.28
a lot

307.28 --> 312.479
right yeah flutters debate was also

310.32 --> 315.84
pretty good yesterday

312.479 --> 320.639
although yeah typical tenth man was

315.84 --> 320.63899999999995
being uh exactly

320.8 --> 324.8
as in the last 10 minutes like he was

322.96 --> 327.75899999999996
being very interrupted it got

324.8 --> 329.6
annoying at some point and i just told

327.759 --> 332.32
him like can you please stop

329.6 --> 333.199
and jittering every two seconds and just

332.32 --> 336.08
let me finish

333.199 --> 337.68
like you don't have to tell me that this

336.08 --> 339.44
is all presuppositional no

337.68 --> 341.36
[ __ ] dude why do you what do you think

339.44 --> 343.12
i'm doing

341.36 --> 345.84000000000003
like i've done that sort of thing it's

343.12 --> 350.0
like an art and i've been doing that for

345.84 --> 353.59999999999997
for a year pretty much since he arrived

350.0 --> 356.639
so like if he doesn't get it

353.6 --> 359.52000000000004
nah then he's just

356.639 --> 361.039
dozed off or something mentally but it's

359.52 --> 363.28
yeah it's very annoying when he does

361.039 --> 363.28
that

363.919 --> 370.08
but yeah after that point after

367.44 --> 372.8
after that point he kind of stopped

370.08 --> 375.44
doing that a little

372.8 --> 381.84000000000003
but yeah good show monday show typical

375.44 --> 381.84
very informative

386.479 --> 395.84
yes i know good servant this is episode

389.56 --> 395.84
661 that's correct

401.84 --> 409.28
so rasta informed me by the way that he

404.96 --> 411.44
was on your show good servant

409.28 --> 413.84
i yeah i'll have to watch that very

411.44 --> 413.84
curious

417.599 --> 425.68
have you see that they found

420.72 --> 425.68
life on venus due to looking at a gas

425.84 --> 432.71999999999997
yeah of course they have

429.759 --> 433.759
if they can already figure out the core

432.72 --> 437.199
of the moon

433.759 --> 440.16
then of course they can just

437.199 --> 451.84000000000003
find life by looking at gas that makes

440.16 --> 451.84000000000003
perfect sense

462.84 --> 465.84
do

467.199 --> 473.68
no it doesn't say 660 refresh

470.4 --> 478.0
i literally edited

473.68 --> 493.84000000000003
i edited it so just refresh the page

478.0 --> 493.84
should say 661

494.56 --> 496.879
right

499.199 --> 505.36
yeah guys it's really hot

502.639 --> 507.36
i got up pretty late i i even like i had

505.36 --> 510.40000000000003
to take a shower

507.36 --> 513.599
so it is all kind of compacted i took

510.4 --> 515.279
like my first joint of the day what is

513.599 --> 518.5600000000001
it now

515.279 --> 520.24
uh like 30 minutes ago roughly

518.56 --> 522.4789999999999
and it's still kind of lingering after

520.24 --> 522.479
yeah

522.8 --> 528.64
so take it easy on me

526.72 --> 530.5600000000001
but at the same time don't take it easy

528.64 --> 532.56
on me because hey if people actually get

530.56 --> 534.8
fired up in chat that usually

532.56 --> 535.76
it's very easy for me to latch on to and

534.8 --> 539.04
then get

535.76 --> 541.76
pulled into activity as well as you all

539.04 --> 541.76
know by now

542.72 --> 545.6
in it

547.519 --> 550.72
yes yeah resta

561.839 --> 567.2790000000001
ah right oh that's much more sensible

570.68 --> 573.75
[Music]

574.399 --> 579.44
but yeah normally i do smoke some in the

577.6 --> 582.24
morning but

579.44 --> 585.44
in the morning in the afternoon never

582.24 --> 588.64
really in the morning that's crazy

585.44 --> 591.0400000000001
but yeah

588.64 --> 593.1999999999999
it's better for me if i smoke it like an

591.04 --> 595.519
hour before the show at least

593.2 --> 596.24
so it can get through like the peak and

595.519 --> 598.24
the dip

596.24 --> 600.48
and get bit normal again because

598.24 --> 605.839
otherwise i'm yeah

600.48 --> 605.839
do it too shortly before the show

606.079 --> 610.8
then sometimes i get a little bit tired

608.24 --> 610.8
at the beginning

612.64 --> 616.0
but yeah especially if you're going to

614.0 --> 619.44
do physical labor

616.0 --> 623.36
it's it's better to just not do it and

619.44 --> 625.519
do it afterward eat some sugar

623.36 --> 625.519
no

626.959 --> 633.8389999999999
no that doesn't that's not gonna help

630.079 --> 633.8389999999999
i got green tea anyway

635.36 --> 639.839
the effect just needs to subside you

637.68 --> 641.12
know taking something quickly is not

639.839 --> 647.519
gonna

641.12 --> 650.64
really help

647.519 --> 652.24
okay that's a weird smiley thing i never

650.64 --> 661.12
seen that one before

652.24 --> 663.44
harass them

661.12 --> 663.44
right

665.04 --> 669.8389999999999
but yeah it's kind of weird you know in

668.0 --> 672.88
a way

669.839 --> 673.36
how i do this show it's kind of rare now

672.88 --> 675.519
that

673.36 --> 677.839
at least during weekdays that i even get

675.519 --> 679.68
into flat earth that extensively

677.839 --> 683.0400000000001
and then as soon as the flat of the bait

679.68 --> 686.64
starts like i get it all out

683.04 --> 688.8
like it's all built up and i done

686.64 --> 692.0
and just put these things down in these

688.8 --> 694.079
conceptions even sometimes from a

692.0 --> 695.92
from an innocent heliocentric

694.079 --> 699.1999999999999
perspective

695.92 --> 701.8389999999999
or from a designer's perspective but

699.2 --> 703.519
yeah during during my own show i rarely

701.839 --> 706.5600000000001
really get to that because i'm just not

703.519 --> 710.16
that inspired to even do that

706.56 --> 710.16
if it's just me sitting here

711.44 --> 716.0790000000001
yeah unless people start bringing in

713.44 --> 719.839
really good questions

716.079 --> 719.8389999999999
like really technical questions

727.41 --> 731.4399999999999
[Music]

729.519 --> 733.2
like what did you guys think about my

731.44 --> 735.519
assessment that

733.2 --> 736.399
since the atmosphere reaches onto the

735.519 --> 740.32
moon now

736.399 --> 745.68
supposedly that they could probably just

740.32 --> 748.5600000000001
harvest that gas on the moon

745.68 --> 749.1999999999999
and and store it in in big tankers and

748.56 --> 752.7199999999999
that way

749.2 --> 753.519
create air or use it for other resources

752.72 --> 754.9590000000001
i don't know what

753.519 --> 757.36
what type of air should be there it's

754.959 --> 761.04
probably only

757.36 --> 764.9590000000001
hydrogen and helium i think

761.04 --> 765.36
it should be very thin but if there is

764.959 --> 768.0
some

765.36 --> 769.279
then technically it it could potentially

768.0 --> 772.32
be collected

769.279 --> 774.399
and if you get that

772.32 --> 776.399
process going without burning some

774.399 --> 779.519
fossil fuels or something

776.399 --> 781.12
by like a natural mechanism

779.519 --> 784.5600000000001
then yeah it might take a long time but

781.12 --> 788.24
you could just slowly build up these

784.56 --> 791.279
gas tankers anyway yeah that was me

788.24 --> 794.32
in my science fiction idea that i put

791.279 --> 794.32
out during the debate yeah

798.839 --> 802.1600000000001
yesterday

800.16 --> 803.4399999999999
because yeah technically i am a

802.16 --> 807.279
scientific

803.44 --> 807.2790000000001
science fiction enthusiast so

810.56 --> 819.1199999999999
i always did that sort of thing

815.12 --> 821.36
it like i have so many memories

819.12 --> 822.5600000000001
because of the associated feeling if you

821.36 --> 824.8000000000001
know when i do that

822.56 --> 827.8389999999999
when i bring up some idea like that i

824.8 --> 831.92
have so many associating

827.839 --> 833.9200000000001
with like my teens and even my preteens

831.92 --> 836.16
where i would see something on tv and

833.92 --> 838.88
then just like immediately start talking

836.16 --> 840.88
to my brother or to a friend

838.88 --> 842.24
about this sort of thing and then just

840.88 --> 843.92
like but

842.24 --> 845.44
this and that and this and that in

843.92 --> 847.76
details and like oh

845.44 --> 848.8000000000001
if this is the case then why haven't

847.76 --> 852.079
they done

848.8 --> 854.7199999999999
that as a technical solution i i would

852.079 --> 856.16
always be busying myself with that

854.72 --> 858.639
because i i i really

856.16 --> 860.8
thought for a long time that like i

858.639 --> 865.839
could really be one of

860.8 --> 865.8389999999999
these people or the designers of that

866.72 --> 872.399
but later

870.32 --> 873.6800000000001
when i tried to get more serious about

872.399 --> 875.44
it i just

873.68 --> 877.3599999999999
got confronted with people that were

875.44 --> 880.8000000000001
supposedly in contact

877.36 --> 885.6800000000001
like with nasa and all that and

880.8 --> 887.8389999999999
yeah they just rejected it

885.68 --> 888.8
like like there's not supposed to be a

887.839 --> 890.72
solution

888.8 --> 894.56
literally that's kind of their that was

890.72 --> 894.5600000000001
their response they were very rejecting

895.68 --> 899.5999999999999
even though yeah i might have had

897.6 --> 901.44
actually a good idea or they would be

899.6 --> 903.279
like huh and then just

901.44 --> 904.9590000000001
move on to the next subject to try and

903.279 --> 907.199
make me forget about it

904.959 --> 909.279
that happened like all the time well not

907.199 --> 913.8389999999999
all the time the times that i was

909.279 --> 913.8389999999999
actually confront with the nasa

914.079 --> 919.04
person representative or yeah whatever

919.92 --> 924.0
it's funny how that works because of

922.399 --> 926.88
like the frequency of that

924.0 --> 927.76
those actions like all associating

926.88 --> 931.519
actions

927.76 --> 934.72
throughout my life they resonate

931.519 --> 936.8
with such a moment so i remember it all

934.72 --> 941.839
of that specific type it's interesting

936.8 --> 941.8389999999999
how that works with my memory sometimes

948.639 --> 953.12
yeah i call it fossil fuels yeah you

950.639 --> 955.6
know when we're talking about

953.12 --> 958.32
i don't know gas collectors on the moon

955.6 --> 960.5600000000001
rock with the atmosphere reaching

958.32 --> 963.0400000000001
there and all that yeah i think if i'm

960.56 --> 965.04
gonna go there

963.04 --> 966.48
yeah i might as just as well save fossil

965.04 --> 983.8389999999999
fuels you know

966.48 --> 983.839
keep it like within that narrative

991.6 --> 997.12
0.2 atoms of atmosphere that reaches the

994.56 --> 1001.3599999999999
moon i think you're down playing it

997.12 --> 1001.36
they really show the graph like with

1001.92 --> 1011.8389999999999
with lines and all that

1012.8 --> 1016.24
it's not going to be 0.2 atoms of

1015.44 --> 1018.399
atmosphere

1016.24 --> 1020.48
total reaching the moon that's just

1018.399 --> 1022.839
ridiculous

1020.48 --> 1025.28
then it would make no sense it's just a

1022.839 --> 1028.24
random one-fifth atom

1025.28 --> 1030.24
sometimes reaching a place that's not

1028.24 --> 1032.079
that basically happens supposedly

1030.24 --> 1033.839
happens throughout the entire vacuum of

1032.079 --> 1038.799
space except maybe at the

1033.839 --> 1041.6789999999999
minimum 17 to the minus

1038.799 --> 1042.6399999999999
10th to the minus tor that thing maybe

1041.679 --> 1044.959
not there

1042.64 --> 1048.3190000000002
but everywhere else yeah that's not

1044.959 --> 1048.319
that's not what that was about

1050.799 --> 1056.6399999999999
just stating facts that are given

1054.4 --> 1058.72
really so they're just downplaying it

1056.64 --> 1060.4
then so it's not

1058.72 --> 1063.039
really reaching the wound that doesn't

1060.4 --> 1066.3200000000002
because it makes no sense

1063.039 --> 1068.96
0.2 atoms atmosphere reaching

1066.32 --> 1071.28
the moon the entire moon that makes no

1068.96 --> 1071.28
sense

1077.039 --> 1080.96
yeah tiny wumbo what he actually means

1079.2 --> 1084.559
is he's just stating

1080.96 --> 1088.24
the information or the data presented to

1084.559 --> 1095.84
him so he thinks

1088.24 --> 1095.84
but i think he misread it

1102.4 --> 1107.1200000000001
okay tiny womble so are you stating then

1105.12 --> 1109.84
that the graph that was presented

1107.12 --> 1110.32
with that those statements that that

1109.84 --> 1114.799
graph

1110.32 --> 1118.48
was actually just fake that it's not

1114.799 --> 1120.24
or like overly suggestive

1118.48 --> 1121.6
are you saying that the entire article

1120.24 --> 1124.88
basically says

1121.6 --> 1128.32
yeah within math

1124.88 --> 1132.0800000000002
somewhere there is sort of this far

1128.32 --> 1133.6
reach supposedly atmospheric layers

1132.08 --> 1135.6
and that will probably go around but

1133.6 --> 1136.24
it's not really an atmospheric layer

1135.6 --> 1137.84
it's just

1136.24 --> 1140.48
much of blabbering is that what you're

1137.84 --> 1143.6
saying tiny wumbo

1140.48 --> 1146.08
i'd like to see some backup

1143.6 --> 1146.08
for that

1146.72 --> 1150.799
because yeah that situation has been

1149.28 --> 1152.72
around for a while and there's

1150.799 --> 1154.96
plenty of people that have read through

1152.72 --> 1154.96
that

1155.29 --> 1158.49
[Music]

1163.12 --> 1168.799
extent of reach yeah so the graph was

1166.24 --> 1170.4
basically misleading because when you

1168.799 --> 1172.08
look at that graph

1170.4 --> 1173.52
you're going to think oh that those are

1172.08 --> 1179.84
atmospheric layers

1173.52 --> 1179.84
right that's natural

1181.039 --> 1184.48
so it was just misleading

1188.24 --> 1193.6
yeah it doesn't matter that it's a b b s

1191.679 --> 1195.039
story and that of course the moon is not

1193.6 --> 1197.36
a physical object out there and the

1195.039 --> 1200.64
earth is not a ball

1197.36 --> 1202.8799999999999
and gas pressure yeah is going to

1200.64 --> 1204.48
expand in all directions until the

1202.88 --> 1206.72
container

1204.48 --> 1208.799
limits the walls of the container have

1206.72 --> 1210.0
been reached and then try to find some

1208.799 --> 1213.12
kind of

1210.0 --> 1213.52
way to divide themselves itself within

1213.12 --> 1216.2399999999998
that

1213.52 --> 1217.36
total container but outer space is

1216.24 --> 1219.84
supposed to be

1217.36 --> 1221.6
an infinite container so that's

1219.84 --> 1223.4399999999998
impossible

1221.6 --> 1224.9599999999998
so yeah the whole thing is complete

1223.44 --> 1228.0800000000002
[ __ ] i know

1224.96 --> 1232.0
is it that hard to stay

1228.08 --> 1235.28
on target in specifics here

1232.0 --> 1238.96
i'm just asking somebody who

1235.28 --> 1238.96
sort of cares about this stuff

1239.44 --> 1245.039
was the picture misleading what it was

1243.039 --> 1247.679
it highly suggestive

1245.039 --> 1250.559
that the atmosphere reaches further

1247.679 --> 1254.0800000000002
wasn't that what the article was about

1250.559 --> 1255.6789999999999
of he's saying well not really

1254.08 --> 1258.0
those things were sort of like

1255.679 --> 1261.6000000000001
calculation blah blah blah

1258.0 --> 1264.72
it wasn't really atmospheric layer

1261.6 --> 1268.9599999999998
then i'd like to just hear that

1264.72 --> 1272.159
like yes yes they were not atmospheric

1268.96 --> 1274.559
layers it was basically a [ __ ] story

1272.159 --> 1275.7600000000002
i'd like to hear it from tiny womble

1274.559 --> 1279.1589999999999
here's who's

1275.76 --> 1281.84
putting this out there sharing us our

1279.159 --> 1286.0800000000002
misunderstanding

1281.84 --> 1286.08
so can i get a confirmation of that tiny

1286.66 --> 1291.8400000000001
[Music]

1288.84 --> 1291.84
womble

1294.5 --> 1297.68
[Music]

1316.84 --> 1319.84
huh

1321.63 --> 1330.8590000000002
[Music]

1372.48 --> 1375.84
all right

1375.919 --> 1380.5590000000002
let me try to find it back the video

1381.6 --> 1389.84
or the picture where's that thing

1386.4 --> 1389.8400000000001
did they retract it or something

1393.76 --> 1397.12
it's been a long time ago

1398.24 --> 1403.84
i still remember how that picture looked

1400.72 --> 1403.84
just trying to find it back

1405.52 --> 1409.9189999999999
it was not a photo or it was a graph

1414.84 --> 1417.84
um

1419.23 --> 1422.259
[Music]

1426.08 --> 1435.9189999999999
right there you go

1431.039 --> 1435.919
yeah from isa yeah

1440.559 --> 1447.039
i guess it it it then would have been

1443.279 --> 1447.039
just an artist interpretation

1450.24 --> 1456.64
right let me

1453.52 --> 1458.6399999999999
share this because this is

1456.64 --> 1461.039
this is close enough to the picture that

1458.64 --> 1464.64
i had in mind

1461.039 --> 1464.64
and it's from isa

1465.2 --> 1473.76
asa alright so

1469.279 --> 1476.32
yeah the light blue

1473.76 --> 1478.559
that's definitely representing

1476.32 --> 1483.76
representing the atmosphere

1478.559 --> 1483.76
so yeah this is from asa

1484.84 --> 1501.84
so

1486.08 --> 1501.84
i guess it is kind of misleading then

1515.279 --> 1518.08
hey agent

1519.44 --> 1525.2
yeah yeah yeah yeah you can stop

1521.279 --> 1525.2
blabbering now it's very annoying

1526.88 --> 1531.6000000000001
yeah you don't have to be an information

1530.159 --> 1534.7990000000002
walking boy

1531.6 --> 1538.48
for institutes okay i don't care

1534.799 --> 1540.4
for that why don't you take a stand why

1538.48 --> 1543.1200000000001
don't you actually

1540.4 --> 1545.44
give your opinion about things you don't

1543.12 --> 1547.36
have to oh look i'm not getting involved

1545.44 --> 1549.44
no you are getting involved you're in my

1547.36 --> 1557.84
chat

1549.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
and i want some feedback

1558.58 --> 1561.82
[Music]

1564.88 --> 1567.2
right

1568.84 --> 1572.799
yeah okay

1571.2 --> 1574.64
just wants to get that out of the way

1572.799 --> 1576.72
that it is misleading

1574.64 --> 1585.8400000000001
and yet not everybody is going to read

1576.72 --> 1585.84
that entire damn thing

1587.039 --> 1592.8799999999999
but yeah i guess you have a point

1590.72 --> 1595.279
if you see an image and you were kind of

1592.88 --> 1597.44
looking for something

1595.279 --> 1600.32
it's important to realize that if it is

1597.44 --> 1603.1200000000001
of a space agency of some kind

1600.32 --> 1604.6399999999999
you literally have to erase the picture

1603.12 --> 1605.9189999999999
from your mind and just read what

1604.64 --> 1606.96
they're talking about because the

1605.919 --> 1609.76
picture

1606.96 --> 1611.3600000000001
can often turn out to be just a complete

1609.76 --> 1613.2
[ __ ]

1611.36 --> 1614.6399999999999
impression that has nothing to do with

1613.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
the actual article

1614.64 --> 1627.8400000000001
i think they like to do that a lot

1629.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
hmm now is it hot over there too agm

1653.76 --> 1656.08
hmm

1665.039 --> 1672.32
hey ordinary bear

1669.039 --> 1672.32
how's the weather over there

1677.679 --> 1681.6000000000001
yeah this definitely seems like a an

1680.0 --> 1684.88
interesting

1681.6 --> 1687.6789999999999
after summer in september again

1684.88 --> 1689.6000000000001
it's not the first time so maybe this is

1687.679 --> 1693.039
like

1689.6 --> 1696.799
yeah it's been happening a lot

1693.039 --> 1697.52
even though like for example 30 years

1696.799 --> 1701.44
ago

1697.52 --> 1701.44
this wouldn't happen not like this

1701.919 --> 1706.5590000000002
there would always be a lot more rain

1704.399 --> 1710.399
during september september would be like

1706.559 --> 1713.6789999999999
rain all the time all the time

1710.399 --> 1715.1999999999998
in the netherlands but now

1713.679 --> 1717.76
it doesn't really happen like that

1715.2 --> 1720.799
anymore so it seems and we get this

1717.76 --> 1725.52
weird little after summer often if it's

1720.799 --> 1729.039
not like too clouded

1725.52 --> 1729.039
so yeah it's interesting

1731.76 --> 1739.84
and it's good for for crops i think

1735.279 --> 1739.84
it's pretty useful

1740.799 --> 1746.399
to get like a last piece of sun before

1743.279 --> 1746.399
being picked and all that

1748.559 --> 1752.0
because before in september if it would

1751.76 --> 1755.52
get

1752.0 --> 1757.919
rainy then yeah we would have issues

1755.52 --> 1759.279
because yeah when it continually rains

1757.919 --> 1762.3200000000002
like that eventually just

1759.279 --> 1764.48
fungus starts to take a grip in all

1762.32 --> 1769.6
kinds of things and other

1764.48 --> 1769.6
issues with yeah food crops and all that

1770.0 --> 1773.919
but yeah with this kind of weather in

1772.32 --> 1778.08
september it's just great

1773.919 --> 1778.0800000000002
it's great for the agriculture here

1778.96 --> 1781.8400000000001
i think

1782.159 --> 1786.88
i haven't personally asked but i would

1785.36 --> 1795.84
suspect that it would be

1786.88 --> 1795.8400000000001
very good

1801.36 --> 1805.6
yep so the after summer and it's funny

1803.919 --> 1809.3600000000001
because

1805.6 --> 1812.7199999999998
also hot maze

1809.36 --> 1815.6
the month of may it's

1812.72 --> 1816.96
you could almost like start to draw like

1815.6 --> 1820.799
patterns

1816.96 --> 1824.48
into it it's almost like okay you got

1820.799 --> 1826.72
like half a year from may to september

1824.48 --> 1828.559
roughly and then both may and september

1826.72 --> 1831.6000000000001
have like heat peaks

1828.559 --> 1835.76
they go down and then you get a big bulk

1831.6 --> 1839.1999999999998
of summer so it is is so much like an

1835.76 --> 1842.8799999999999
oscillating pattern how it works

1839.2 --> 1846.64
much more distinct than it used to be

1842.88 --> 1850.5590000000002
before it used to be much more

1846.64 --> 1853.3600000000001
deeper and then just

1850.559 --> 1853.36
more steady

1853.76 --> 1858.96
and now it just seems to oscillate a

1856.24 --> 1858.96
little more it's

1862.84 --> 1866.32
interesting

1864.08 --> 1868.24
how the weather patterns seem to like

1866.32 --> 1871.279
kind of change

1868.24 --> 1876.32
and with the with the spring break is

1871.279 --> 1879.12
like a yeah a known phenomenon

1876.32 --> 1881.84
that happens every year in a very unique

1879.12 --> 1884.32
moment when usually things are still

1881.84 --> 1885.36
kind of frozen and then suddenly in a

1884.32 --> 1888.1589999999999
week or something

1885.36 --> 1888.7199999999998
it all kind of melts in in specific

1888.159 --> 1891.519
spots

1888.72 --> 1892.0
and gets really nice and sunny and then

1891.519 --> 1894.72
after that

1892.0 --> 1895.76
it goes back to kind of freezing a

1894.72 --> 1898.799
little and

1895.76 --> 1907.84
then eventually the spring really kind

1898.799 --> 1907.84
of starts

1910.399 --> 1916.7199999999998
hmm right tiny one more one england

1913.919 --> 1919.039
it's always kind of been mostly rain in

1916.72 --> 1920.88
the summer anyway

1919.039 --> 1923.36
water just starts to hang around on the

1920.88 --> 1923.3600000000001
island

1928.399 --> 1932.4799999999998
ice skating yeah crochet yeah in the

1931.12 --> 1935.6
netherlands

1932.48 --> 1939.44
yeah we used to have that a lot

1935.6 --> 1943.6
ice skating but now there yeah there

1939.44 --> 1943.6000000000001
there is now like

1944.08 --> 1950.399
was it ski places

1947.36 --> 1952.8799999999999
like artificial official ski places

1950.399 --> 1954.399
there's one that i know of at least

1952.88 --> 1957.6000000000001
maybe more

1954.399 --> 1960.7199999999998
and probably skating

1957.6 --> 1960.7199999999998
how do you even call that

1961.519 --> 1969.84
uh skating stadiums ice skating stadiums

1966.48 --> 1973.039
probably because yeah real

1969.84 --> 1975.36
ice and snow seems to be a little bit

1973.039 --> 1977.36
more rare now it still happens but

1975.36 --> 1978.799
it's not enough it's not cold enough to

1977.36 --> 1981.1999999999998
really

1978.799 --> 1983.679
freeze up the water long enough for it

1981.2 --> 1991.8400000000001
to become skateable

1983.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
ice rinks all right

1994.08 --> 2002.84
arena all right could be

1998.96 --> 2005.8400000000001
ice skating arena is that what they call

2002.84 --> 2005.84
it

2016.84 --> 2019.84
do

2022.0 --> 2025.679
the rink hmm

2026.799 --> 2031.91
i've never heard of that before that

2028.32 --> 2033.36
terminology okay

2031.91 --> 2035.6000000000001
[Music]

2033.36 --> 2037.84
not that i'm particularly interested in

2035.6 --> 2040.48
ice skating i actually kind of hated it

2037.84 --> 2046.72
as a kid because it always freaking hurt

2040.48 --> 2049.04
my ankles

2046.72 --> 2051.28
like i would have actually kind of fun i

2049.04 --> 2053.119
could even like get pretty fast

2051.28 --> 2054.8790000000004
but i would always get to a point where

2053.119 --> 2055.9190000000003
i would just freaking hurt my ankles

2054.879 --> 2058.96
again

2055.919 --> 2061.2799999999997
or my shins it's just so annoying so i i

2058.96 --> 2062.879
don't i didn't really like it

2061.28 --> 2065.8390000000004
because i would always end up with

2062.879 --> 2065.839
bruises and [ __ ]

2070.48 --> 2075.839
hmm all right

2103.68 --> 2108.3999999999996
right anyway that's why are we talking

2106.8 --> 2110.2400000000002
about ice skating

2108.4 --> 2113.04
oh yeah maybe because it's hot and it

2110.24 --> 2117.839
sounds kind of refreshing

2113.04 --> 2117.839
yeah no no ice skating for me

2119.04 --> 2123.119
[Music]

2120.96 --> 2124.88
not that i would never do it again or

2123.119 --> 2128.079
something

2124.88 --> 2131.2000000000003
but you know if i happen to go

2128.079 --> 2133.8390000000004
to a very cold region for some reason

2131.2 --> 2134.72
then i might have just as well try it

2133.839 --> 2138.56
out

2134.72 --> 2140.9599999999996
again and then get

2138.56 --> 2142.64
yeah hurt my shins and my ankles again

2140.96 --> 2146.48
and then remind myself oh yeah that's

2142.64 --> 2146.48
why i didn't really like it that much

2150.32 --> 2154.88
yeah 11 city tour that i don't think

2153.28 --> 2158.88
we're gonna get that for some

2154.88 --> 2162.079
for some time to come

2158.88 --> 2164.1600000000003
unless we get like this bizarre cracking

2162.079 --> 2168.0
cold winter all of a sudden

2164.16 --> 2168.0
might it might just happen i don't know

2171.28 --> 2177.8390000000004
do i think in english

2174.4 --> 2179.6800000000003
yes partly i do but it's because i'm so

2177.839 --> 2182.88
used to it

2179.68 --> 2185.2
especially when i talk technicals when i

2182.88 --> 2186.0
when i go now into the kind of like the

2185.2 --> 2188.8799999999997
the sharing

2186.0 --> 2191.52
talking mode as i am doing now then i do

2188.88 --> 2194.079
tend to think in english

2191.52 --> 2195.52
because i'm doing it so much more in

2194.079 --> 2198.1600000000003
english than i

2195.52 --> 2199.68
am doing it in dutch i you it used to be

2198.16 --> 2200.0
the other way around i used to do this

2199.68 --> 2203.2799999999997
in

2200.0 --> 2205.28
touch too i'm still good at it but now

2203.28 --> 2207.2000000000003
if i'm talking like this in dutch i kind

2205.28 --> 2210.5600000000004
of have to parallel

2207.2 --> 2212.96
because like a dutch conception and an

2210.56 --> 2214.24
english conception will simultaneously

2212.96 --> 2217.2
spawn

2214.24 --> 2217.68
and have to basically like in my mind be

2217.2 --> 2220.0
kind of

2217.68 --> 2221.2799999999997
bit cross-eyed and keep my eyes on the

2220.0 --> 2224.64
right language

2221.28 --> 2224.6400000000003
it's weird how that works

2226.48 --> 2231.68
so it all depends on what

2229.52 --> 2233.44
type of language am i speaking the most

2231.68 --> 2236.0789999999997
watch and i develop it

2233.44 --> 2236.96
i develop the language too as i am

2236.079 --> 2238.8
speaking

2236.96 --> 2241.28
looking up words learning new words and

2238.8 --> 2244.1600000000003
also just

2241.28 --> 2245.119
words arrive sometimes and then they

2244.16 --> 2246.8799999999997
turn out to be

2245.119 --> 2248.2400000000002
correct that's really amazing to me

2246.88 --> 2249.04
every time that happens but the more

2248.24 --> 2252.8799999999997
that happens

2249.04 --> 2257.839
the more my mind like becomes

2252.88 --> 2257.839
that language eventually

2258.72 --> 2264.3199999999997
well more colored it's just english

2262.0 --> 2264.32
you know

2265.2 --> 2269.1189999999997
like i'm clumsy at best at other

2268.16 --> 2271.839
languages

2269.119 --> 2274.079
although i can't understand them a

2271.839 --> 2274.0789999999997
little

2274.32 --> 2279.28
like i can zone tune in to like

2276.88 --> 2281.52
conversations and then eventually

2279.28 --> 2284.96
kind of figure out what language it is

2281.52 --> 2286.8
and then what's i might recognize a

2284.96 --> 2289.44
couple of words and then just

2286.8 --> 2291.2000000000003
build it build what the scenario what is

2289.44 --> 2294.48
actually happening there

2291.2 --> 2294.48
and what they're like

2296.96 --> 2301.76
you think in spanglish good servant

2299.44 --> 2301.76
really

2310.839 --> 2313.92
huh

2312.0 --> 2316.4
right tiny one well yeah i'm what

2313.92 --> 2319.119
basically my profession is speaking

2316.4 --> 2321.52
english it's funny how that worked out

2319.119 --> 2324.839
because i'm speaking english on the show

2321.52 --> 2326.88
on the debates going around i write

2324.839 --> 2329.04
english

2326.88 --> 2330.4
i might occasionally say something in

2329.04 --> 2332.4
dutch

2330.4 --> 2333.44
but i think that most dutch people are

2332.4 --> 2336.56
kind of

2333.44 --> 2338.839
tuned into the english as well so

2336.56 --> 2341.839
they're kind of used to it

2338.839 --> 2341.839
anyway

2352.72 --> 2356.56
that sounds kind of smelly random

2363.51 --> 2366.559
[Music]

2366.839 --> 2369.839
explorer

2380.839 --> 2383.839
right

2386.32 --> 2391.76
yeah good servant makes sense

2389.52 --> 2392.56
but it's also some things i've picked up

2391.76 --> 2396.6400000000003
is that just

2392.56 --> 2398.64
the way to go about in spanish

2396.64 --> 2401.2
and the way to go about in english is

2398.64 --> 2404.72
just so very different

2401.2 --> 2408.7999999999997
the way to be the way to

2404.72 --> 2413.359
how do you say compose yourself

2408.8 --> 2416.319
socially is so different like

2413.359 --> 2418.64
it works differently it's just it's a

2416.319 --> 2421.52
different order

2418.64 --> 2424.24
so sometimes you know i can imagine that

2421.52 --> 2427.359
as an english person sometimes if you

2424.24 --> 2428.72
try to explain something to a spanish

2427.359 --> 2432.24
person that could

2428.72 --> 2433.04
speak spanish or english that they might

2432.24 --> 2435.9199999999996
at some point

2433.04 --> 2437.839
have to just kind of stalk spanish or in

2435.92 --> 2439.6800000000003
the way of spanish to really make the

2437.839 --> 2440.56
other one understand because it's just

2439.68 --> 2442.24
different

2440.56 --> 2445.359
it's a different way of feeling and

2442.24 --> 2445.359
thinking in a way it's

2448.56 --> 2451.2799999999997
like there's this

2451.599 --> 2455.92
this there's just this fiery spirit in

2454.48 --> 2459.44
spanish a lot

2455.92 --> 2461.599
it's like it's kind of normal there

2459.44 --> 2462.8
not that everybody's all fiery all the

2461.599 --> 2464.96
time but it

2462.8 --> 2466.0
it just has a more prominent place

2464.96 --> 2469.68
within the way

2466.0 --> 2471.28
it works and the way you socialize it's

2469.68 --> 2474.0
fascinating how it works and with

2471.28 --> 2475.8390000000004
english it's it's not so much

2474.0 --> 2478.24
with english when things get really

2475.839 --> 2481.599
fired up things can

2478.24 --> 2485.2
get really rough so it

2481.599 --> 2487.92
like more consequences there's less

2485.2 --> 2488.56
diplomacy after things really heat up in

2487.92 --> 2491.839
english

2488.56 --> 2494.48
really really so

2491.839 --> 2496.16
that's why it's avoided usually at all

2494.48 --> 2497.76
costs

2496.16 --> 2500.64
does that makes does it make sense what

2497.76 --> 2500.6400000000003
i'm saying right now

2504.96 --> 2509.839
or is this just a mind fart of mine

2513.2 --> 2517.359
it's just that that meta yeah italians

2515.44 --> 2519.92
may have it too a little

2517.359 --> 2521.5989999999997
they're just more used to being fired up

2519.92 --> 2522.0
so if they get fired up it doesn't

2521.599 --> 2525.76
always

2522.0 --> 2528.24
mean that it ends bad they can also then

2525.76 --> 2528.88
work with it and then maneuver out of it

2528.24 --> 2532.72
again

2528.88 --> 2537.52
somehow you know even bond over

2532.72 --> 2539.4399999999996
being fired up it's more common

2537.52 --> 2542.079
in the mediterranean it's fascinating

2539.44 --> 2544.16
how that works

2542.079 --> 2546.2400000000002
with english yeah you gotta you got a

2544.16 --> 2547.359
problem usually when you get too fired

2546.24 --> 2549.52
up

2547.359 --> 2551.359
things get really hostile and then yeah

2549.52 --> 2556.4
you have to walk away you know

2551.359 --> 2556.4
it'll probably sound familiar and

2556.8 --> 2563.3590000000004
yeah with dutch i don't know

2560.88 --> 2566.0
it's probably very similar to english

2563.359 --> 2566.0
but dutch

2567.68 --> 2571.2799999999997
i don't know it's different again it's

2569.599 --> 2572.2400000000002
it's another way of going about it's

2571.28 --> 2575.28
very

2572.24 --> 2575.2799999999997
similar to german

2576.319 --> 2579.839
italian mentality

2602.72 --> 2606.0789999999997
yeah well people have actually mistaken

2605.599 --> 2608.48
me for

2606.079 --> 2611.3590000000004
italian literally they they would ask me

2608.48 --> 2614.56
are you italian

2611.359 --> 2617.7599999999998
because i got the mustache and i am

2614.56 --> 2620.96
very verbal with my hands but i don't

2617.76 --> 2623.2000000000003
talk with that stupid accent

2620.96 --> 2624.8
but they just think because i am very

2623.2 --> 2629.04
passionate and outspoken and

2624.8 --> 2631.2000000000003
like very straightforward

2629.04 --> 2634.0
some people think that i'm italian and

2631.2 --> 2636.0789999999997
because i wear black leather

2634.0 --> 2638.72
jacket and all that i don't know they

2636.079 --> 2638.7200000000003
just think it

2642.72 --> 2647.9199999999996
but it's probably because when i get

2645.04 --> 2648.56
really when i basically trust somebody

2647.92 --> 2651.52
like

2648.56 --> 2652.48
feels right and i open up and i like get

2651.52 --> 2654.56
all

2652.48 --> 2656.56
descriptive and technical then i

2654.56 --> 2658.48
immediately start to work

2656.56 --> 2660.16
my hands start to flop all over the

2658.48 --> 2663.2
place so i think that probably also

2660.16 --> 2665.44
gives an impression that i'm italian

2663.2 --> 2666.64
also for some reason every italian girl

2665.44 --> 2670.079
that i seem to

2666.64 --> 2673.2
bump into usually in a certain store

2670.079 --> 2673.2000000000003
they all kind of like me

2673.839 --> 2677.68
and it what is also kind of weird is

2675.92 --> 2680.88
that

2677.68 --> 2685.5989999999997
yeah my brother is like has an

2680.88 --> 2685.599
italian partner woman

2685.839 --> 2689.68
so maybe there is something about our

2688.56 --> 2692.4
family

2689.68 --> 2694.64
that just kind of worked with italy like

2692.4 --> 2697.2000000000003
that even though me as a kid going there

2694.64 --> 2698.16
again this yeah some of you probably

2697.2 --> 2701.52
forgot

2698.16 --> 2702.3999999999996
i have like this trauma in italy where i

2701.52 --> 2704.24
was kind of like

2702.4 --> 2705.44
left to my devices with people that i

2704.24 --> 2706.8799999999997
didn't know that got

2705.44 --> 2708.7200000000003
suddenly pissed off because of a

2706.88 --> 2711.92
misunderstanding

2708.72 --> 2713.9199999999996
poor social skills on my part but it was

2711.92 --> 2715.92
a super little kid it was like five or

2713.92 --> 2718.56
something

2715.92 --> 2719.599
so yeah my personal association with

2718.56 --> 2722.7999999999997
italy is not

2719.599 --> 2725.44
really good but yeah when

2722.8 --> 2733.8390000000004
italians come over here then usually i

2725.44 --> 2733.839
kind of tend to like them

2759.599 --> 2763.2000000000003
yes i have absolutely yeah dude tiny

2762.48 --> 2766.96
wombo i

2763.2 --> 2766.96
i even have like a page on

2767.04 --> 2775.2
what is it fiverr

2771.359 --> 2778.319
i literally never got a single response

2775.2 --> 2779.2
but i guess that if i would have to do

2778.319 --> 2782.0
that i would

2779.2 --> 2782.96
have to literally just do that

2782.0 --> 2784.72
specifically

2782.96 --> 2787.359
all the time on fiverr and just

2784.72 --> 2791.4399999999996
constantly advertise with videos

2787.359 --> 2795.7599999999998
well i was kind of in the works of that

2791.44 --> 2798.079
and then i was like okay no i'm going to

2795.76 --> 2799.44
i'm going to just go youtube i'm going

2798.079 --> 2803.8390000000004
to get monetized

2799.44 --> 2803.839
1000 subscribers remember

2803.92 --> 2816.4
of course you remember oh dear so i kind

2807.599 --> 2820.0
of like dropped that

2816.4 --> 2823.839
but yeah i could be

2820.0 --> 2823.839
a translator yes i could

2825.04 --> 2831.839
it's a skill that i have and i've

2827.599 --> 2831.839
actually utilized it before

2852.16 --> 2861.7599999999998
oh nice

2859.599 --> 2863.2000000000003
that's pretty good more colored yeah i

2861.76 --> 2865.92
myself practiced

2863.2 --> 2867.359
a lot on the pronunciation as well with

2865.92 --> 2869.599
the other language like

2867.359 --> 2871.359
it's the thing that i get more about the

2869.599 --> 2873.52
language than actually the entire

2871.359 --> 2874.5589999999997
language is just the way it's pronounced

2873.52 --> 2877.04
the way

2874.559 --> 2877.8390000000004
the sounds work that's the part that i

2877.04 --> 2880.5589999999997
do learn

2877.839 --> 2882.64
pretty easy so even like if i have a

2880.559 --> 2884.6400000000003
piece of paper with some text on it in a

2882.64 --> 2886.64
foreign language

2884.64 --> 2888.8799999999997
i might recognize it and then i will

2886.64 --> 2892.24
basically try to read it out

2888.88 --> 2894.4
in the language as i am basically

2892.24 --> 2896.24
yeah i'm figuring it out on the spot

2894.4 --> 2898.64
like trying to improvise like

2896.24 --> 2901.839
what will the language be and usually it

2898.64 --> 2901.839
turns out pretty damn good

2902.079 --> 2908.319
i can't pre yeah i can if i just know

2906.72 --> 2909.9199999999996
if i have to pronounce it read out a

2908.319 --> 2913.2799999999997
sentence in the language then i can

2909.92 --> 2917.2000000000003
probably do it pretty damn good

2913.28 --> 2917.2000000000003
at least with uh french

2917.52 --> 2924.48
spanish german

2921.28 --> 2928.1600000000003
and english yes just don't eat yet

2924.48 --> 2930.0
it's just second nature other languages

2928.16 --> 2934.0
not so much by the way

2930.0 --> 2934.0
i've kept it kind of european like that

2941.76 --> 2945.599
watched a lot of foreign movies right

2944.24 --> 2948.0
well that'll help a lot

2945.599 --> 2948.88
you know for me i i really got close to

2948.0 --> 2951.92
english

2948.88 --> 2954.0
because back in the day we got a lot of

2951.92 --> 2957.04
cartoons coming in from the united

2954.0 --> 2959.119
states and they had dutch subtitles

2957.04 --> 2960.24
there was no translation for it and

2959.119 --> 2962.7200000000003
that's

2960.24 --> 2965.359
how i got exposed to english at a very

2962.72 --> 2965.359
young age

2967.359 --> 2970.72
and that really made me want to get it

2970.079 --> 2972.559
like i

2970.72 --> 2974.319
because sometimes it was just so amazing

2972.559 --> 2975.599
what i would be seeing on screen in

2974.319 --> 2978.8
space and

2975.599 --> 2981.52
planets and and just fighting

2978.8 --> 2983.3590000000004
[ __ ] and aliens and all kinds of it was

2981.52 --> 2985.7599999999998
so exciting to me

2983.359 --> 2987.2799999999997
robots of course of course the robot

2985.76 --> 2990.0
transformers

2987.28 --> 2992.2400000000002
number one motivator for me to learn

2990.0 --> 2994.079
english

2992.24 --> 2996.0
because i just wanted to know like what

2994.079 --> 2998.319
are they really talking about there must

2996.0 --> 3002.16
be something really deep going on now

2998.319 --> 3002.16
now that i actually know english

3002.559 --> 3007.599
when i watch transformers g1 that at the

3005.28 --> 3009.92
time was just mind blowing to me

3007.599 --> 3011.6800000000003
i realized how incredibly stupid the

3009.92 --> 3012.7200000000003
conversations were and completely

3011.68 --> 3015.68
pointless often

3012.72 --> 3015.68
and pretty

3016.079 --> 3023.44
yeah it wasn't worked out all that great

3020.079 --> 3025.8390000000004
the conversations but back then

3023.44 --> 3027.44
i didn't know that so it was like who

3025.839 --> 3029.68
are these mysterious

3027.44 --> 3031.92
brilliant people that i don't understand

3029.68 --> 3035.2
that are put doing all this action see i

3031.92 --> 3036.88
fantasized like this glory over it

3035.2 --> 3038.5589999999997
because i didn't understand what they

3036.88 --> 3040.1600000000003
were actually talking about and that it

3038.559 --> 3043.2000000000003
was kind of stupid

3040.16 --> 3045.1189999999997
i didn't know that i didn't see it i

3043.2 --> 3046.16
didn't pick it up on my feelings i was

3045.119 --> 3047.76
kind of overwhelmed

3046.16 --> 3050.48
because that's what happens when you're

3047.76 --> 3054.6400000000003
a very little kid

3050.48 --> 3057.76
and i remember that how that worked

3054.64 --> 3061.2
how different things are and also like

3057.76 --> 3063.8390000000004
how mysterious the illusion

3061.2 --> 3065.7599999999998
can be coming out of something that you

3063.839 --> 3069.359
don't understand how much that can

3065.76 --> 3072.3190000000004
inspire you that's

3069.359 --> 3074.72
that is a fascinating thing and it's

3072.319 --> 3076.0
also dangerous by the way

3074.72 --> 3079.5989999999997
because i think it's that same

3076.0 --> 3083.04
fascination that actually allows

3079.599 --> 3087.839
spell casters

3083.04 --> 3090.48
to basically pull around people by that

3087.839 --> 3091.359
mystical feeling because they don't

3090.48 --> 3093.359
understand

3091.359 --> 3096.16
and they want to keep you like that so

3093.359 --> 3101.44
they can keep wielding you

3096.16 --> 3101.44
with that mystic sensation

3101.92 --> 3106.079
and i was prone to that mystic sensation

3104.72 --> 3111.839
a lot

3106.079 --> 3111.8390000000004
up until very late very late

3122.96 --> 3127.2
yeah yeah the cartoons these days in the

3125.28 --> 3130.1600000000003
netherlands

3127.2 --> 3133.68
it's i don't even know what they play

3130.16 --> 3133.68
anymore but i know that

3133.92 --> 3142.16
most cartoons like even on netflix

3138.319 --> 3143.92
they just roll out the dutch

3142.16 --> 3145.7599999999998
the dutch translation there's

3143.92 --> 3146.7200000000003
translations of all kinds of with all

3145.76 --> 3149.3590000000004
kinds of movies

3146.72 --> 3151.5989999999997
that are kind of easily available there

3149.359 --> 3153.68
but the cartoons are just standardized

3151.599 --> 3156.079
starting in dutch like they don't expect

3153.68 --> 3160.8799999999997
children to actually wanna

3156.079 --> 3163.04
see it in english that's been removed

3160.88 --> 3163.04
so

3164.559 --> 3181.8390000000004
it really helped me a lot to get

3167.28 --> 3181.8390000000004
motivated to learn english

3183.599 --> 3189.119
oh god anime oh there's so much anime

3189.599 --> 3195.839
there's too much anime

3197.839 --> 3201.68
but you got to be careful with that [ __ ]

3199.839 --> 3203.599
especially when you're like depressed

3201.68 --> 3205.9199999999996
and feel like isolating because you can

3203.599 --> 3208.8
literally drown in that you could

3205.92 --> 3211.44
literally lose yourself and your mind

3208.8 --> 3212.1600000000003
if you try to escape in it and just keep

3211.44 --> 3215.2000000000003
watching

3212.16 --> 3216.16
all of it because you could probably

3215.2 --> 3219.5989999999997
spend just

3216.16 --> 3221.839
like three years non-stop watching one

3219.599 --> 3224.1600000000003
anime after another it would never end

3221.839 --> 3226.48
so much of it it's insane

3224.16 --> 3227.7599999999998
and there's some freaky [ __ ] up [ __ ]

3226.48 --> 3230.8
in there too

3227.76 --> 3230.8
that's not good for you

3234.24 --> 3238.7999999999997
not saying that all anime is bad there's

3237.04 --> 3243.52
some pretty impressive

3238.8 --> 3246.0
stuff out there that i really admire

3243.52 --> 3246.96
like a movie and an anime that really

3246.0 --> 3251.52
impressed me

3246.96 --> 3254.7200000000003
very young was akira oh my god

3251.52 --> 3258.48
now that movie is kind of bad

3254.72 --> 3260.7999999999997
it's not for kids even though these kids

3258.48 --> 3262.319
now these days will probably be like ah

3260.8 --> 3265.2000000000003
could be worse

3262.319 --> 3267.2
yeah that's not a good sign of the times

3265.2 --> 3270.319
that movie is kind of [ __ ] up but

3267.2 --> 3273.9199999999996
oh my god there's so much

3270.319 --> 3276.24
intensity in there and and also

3273.92 --> 3277.04
just mystery like the science fiction

3276.24 --> 3279.359
mystery is

3277.04 --> 3282.0
really intense of it and i like the

3279.359 --> 3284.48
atmospherics and the music

3282.0 --> 3286.72
and just to realize that especially in

3284.48 --> 3292.0
the beginning scenes

3286.72 --> 3297.1189999999997
they all hand drew

3292.0 --> 3299.44
on paper calculated 3d animation

3297.119 --> 3300.7200000000003
there was not really any computer doing

3299.44 --> 3303.04
anything maybe

3300.72 --> 3304.5589999999997
creating a basic wireframe at the start

3303.04 --> 3307.68
to calculate it easy

3304.559 --> 3308.559
but they drew every frame of those 3d

3307.68 --> 3313.5989999999997
scenes

3308.559 --> 3316.7200000000003
by hand every step so mind blowing

3313.599 --> 3319.3590000000004
in a time where yeah good 3d

3316.72 --> 3321.2
looking things there was not a lot of

3319.359 --> 3324.88
that around

3321.2 --> 3326.64
not a lot at all you know and it was

3324.88 --> 3329.04
like oh computers where's the 3d

3326.64 --> 3329.44
animations it can do 3d animations it's

3329.04 --> 3334.16
still

3329.44 --> 3336.319
crappy wireframes and

3334.16 --> 3337.5989999999997
blocks you know like what do you call

3336.319 --> 3340.319
the

3337.599 --> 3342.4
polygon type 3d and we're all like oh

3340.319 --> 3343.2799999999997
where is it and then that movie came out

3342.4 --> 3346.96
with just this

3343.28 --> 3349.8390000000004
mind-boggling beautiful hand-drawn

3346.96 --> 3352.16
thing it's just blown away by that so

3349.839 --> 3352.16
hard

3353.44 --> 3357.2000000000003
that movie like really sucked me and it

3355.359 --> 3360.0
messed me up a little too it like

3357.2 --> 3360.72
it sold some panic because it's very

3360.0 --> 3362.559
anxious

3360.72 --> 3364.0789999999997
the whole thing is very anxious it is

3362.559 --> 3367.3590000000004
horror in in

3364.079 --> 3371.04
psychological ways but also just to

3367.359 --> 3371.04
just visuals in it

3372.64 --> 3376.0
right but yeah it still it still kind of

3375.44 --> 3378.16
stands the

3376.0 --> 3380.16
test of time it's still amazing but just

3378.16 --> 3380.8799999999997
to realize that it was just completely

3380.16 --> 3385.5989999999997
hand drawn

3380.88 --> 3385.599
in that time is just mind blowing

3385.839 --> 3391.839
that that'll never cease to impress me

3395.83 --> 3399.0989999999997
[Music]

3402.839 --> 3405.839
right

3407.119 --> 3410.2400000000002
yeah the art is fantastic but it's also

3409.52 --> 3412.799
just

3410.24 --> 3414.9599999999996
exhilarating it's so address it's so

3412.799 --> 3417.92
adrenal

3414.96 --> 3418.2400000000002
man that's motorcycle action scenes just

3417.92 --> 3421.76
like

3418.24 --> 3424.24
oh i wanna 3d

3421.76 --> 3424.7990000000004
like back then i would get ideas like i

3424.24 --> 3429.52
want

3424.799 --> 3431.52
this in 3d personal experience

3429.52 --> 3433.28
like a game where it's just that

3431.52 --> 3436.319
motorcycle ganks and like

3433.28 --> 3440.079
bashing each other with pipes and [ __ ]

3436.319 --> 3443.599
just on super speedway situ

3440.079 --> 3445.8390000000004
where is that game yeah

3443.599 --> 3448.559
it's it's kind of dilapidated all since

3445.839 --> 3448.5589999999997
then hasn't it

3448.72 --> 3452.5589999999997
so why isn't there this game there

3450.799 --> 3455.04
should be that game

3452.559 --> 3456.88
but yeah the 3d things are still

3455.04 --> 3459.5589999999997
catching up and

3456.88 --> 3462.0
i don't know everything's all been the

3459.559 --> 3465.28
systematically

3462.0 --> 3467.52
modulized and lazy

3465.28 --> 3470.0
and corporate like quick quick cash and

3467.52 --> 3472.4
just uh quick do this

3470.0 --> 3475.839
it's not really that impressive anymore

3472.4 --> 3475.839
i think the whole gaming industry

3476.16 --> 3480.8799999999997
although yeah of course visuals do

3478.079 --> 3483.8390000000004
become a lot better and

3480.88 --> 3487.119
certain choreography is also becoming a

3483.839 --> 3491.2799999999997
little bit more interesting but

3487.119 --> 3494.559
i don't know the fantastical things

3491.28 --> 3499.119
that i expected there to be not so much

3494.559 --> 3503.8390000000004
i'd expected a much more futuristic

3499.119 --> 3503.839
game industry

3504.0 --> 3510.24
but yeah it's it's turned just corporate

3507.04 --> 3511.7599999999998
too much for that incorpora corporations

3510.24 --> 3514.5589999999997
don't innovate they just

3511.76 --> 3516.0
want to cookie cutter things quickly

3514.559 --> 3520.0
together and just reel in

3516.0 --> 3520.0
the cash that's the problem

3527.52 --> 3535.04
right but yeah i'm not doing

3530.72 --> 3538.16
you know now now that i'm 40. i wouldn't

3535.04 --> 3542.0
really go for such a game anymore maybe

3538.16 --> 3544.3999999999996
try it out sometime because it's

3542.0 --> 3546.799
yeah i don't even want to be like enough

3544.4 --> 3549.2000000000003
like constantly do that i just

3546.799 --> 3551.52
the idea of the action but especially

3549.2 --> 3551.52
also

3553.52 --> 3560.24
like being really immersed in it like

3556.88 --> 3564.1600000000003
from a first person perspective

3560.24 --> 3566.799
with proper 3d that you could actually

3564.16 --> 3568.8799999999997
basically see your hands moving as the

3566.799 --> 3570.96
character in there and do [ __ ]

3568.88 --> 3573.76
but yeah that's not there it doesn't

3570.96 --> 3576.2400000000002
exist

3573.76 --> 3579.6800000000003
it's a lot of preliminaries with ooh

3576.24 --> 3582.64
scanning and but it's all

3579.68 --> 3583.2
it's not really good enough to get real

3582.64 --> 3587.839
immersed

3583.2 --> 3587.839
3d things going

3589.92 --> 3593.76
and with the goggles so far they make me

3592.0 --> 3597.119
sick literally they

3593.76 --> 3600.2400000000002
they cause me to become very ill

3597.119 --> 3603.2000000000003
very quickly so yeah it's not gonna work

3600.24 --> 3603.2
for me i'm afraid

3610.0 --> 3614.48
right i'm gonna round out the show i

3612.4 --> 3615.28
just haven't talked about flat earth at

3614.48 --> 3617.28
all wow

3615.28 --> 3620.079
that that's certainly gonna change with

3617.28 --> 3623.0400000000004
the flat earth debates coming up soon

3620.079 --> 3625.119
but uh anyway thanks everyone for coming

3623.04 --> 3627.2799999999997
i hope you liked this show

3625.119 --> 3629.04
if you did then please don't forget the

3627.28 --> 3631.28
rogan's

3629.04 --> 3632.799
