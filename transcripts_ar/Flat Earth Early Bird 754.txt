issues odd

107.52 --> 111.67999999999999
my volume seems to be extra high for

110.159 --> 114.64
some reason

111.68 --> 114.64
very strange

118.399 --> 124.32000000000001
all right so i have to actually put it

126.84 --> 130.72
lower so how's this

131.44 --> 138.0
yeah it looks better i'll put it at

135.2 --> 138.0
-4

138.319 --> 143.83999999999997
weird okay let's try this out for now

144.0 --> 146.319

yeah it's tuesday

150.8 --> 155.20000000000002
finally the dreary rainy weather did

153.519 --> 157.28
stop

155.2 --> 158.64
so it's still a little clouded out there

157.28 --> 161.2
but

158.64 --> 162.95899999999997
at least it's it's no longer raining

161.2 --> 166.879
because it has been

162.959 --> 170.64000000000001
yesterday all day like even in the night

166.879 --> 173.04
it's very annoying and very wet

170.64 --> 175.76
and also windy so like smoking was a

173.04 --> 175.76
real hassle

182.84 --> 185.84
right

186.8 --> 193.12
doesn't seem to be any wind out today

190.4 --> 198.159
glad of that because i still have to go

193.12 --> 199.59900000000002
out for groceries after the show

198.159 --> 202.79999999999998
because yeah certainly wasn't going to

199.599 --> 206.48
go out in that weather from yesterday

202.8 --> 206.48000000000002
because that was yeah i didn't need to

207.04 --> 213.84
so i stayed in right hey here we go

210.319 --> 213.83999999999997

228.24 --> 233.59900000000002
[Music]

230.4 --> 233.59900000000002

235.76 --> 241.76
start no i don't have a cold

238.56 --> 242.4
i just i had to sneeze and then yeah

241.76 --> 245.439
often

242.4 --> 247.68
in the morning i'm just a little bit

245.439 --> 249.92
yeah snotty or however you want to call

247.68 --> 249.92000000000002
that

250.319 --> 254.07999999999998
and yeah especially if i sneeze right

253.12 --> 257.519
during the intro

254.08 --> 258.079
this is get a little snotty but it's not

257.519 --> 260.959
really

258.079 --> 269.36

260.959 --> 273.44
day so

269.36 --> 273.44
oh you do oh that sucks

276.24 --> 281.36
right then again you just finished

279.12 --> 284.56
watching the babylon 5 series so

281.36 --> 287.28000000000003
you are like in the moral

284.56 --> 290.0
in a demoralized state so that doesn't

287.28 --> 290.0

ago but

311.52 --> 315.28
anyway thanks for being a member

313.46 --> 318.0
[Music]

315.28 --> 319.59999999999997
uh yeah i still got to america to

318.0 --> 322.56
america if you haven't had in that in a

319.6 --> 326.08000000000004
long time just regular coffee here

322.56 --> 326.08
was a little cold i think

327.12 --> 330.32
okay not even that cold

330.8 --> 335.68
oh i did okay right and of course green

336.84 --> 341.67999999999995
tea

338.24 --> 344.96000000000004
very late night last night

341.68 --> 347.199
very very late like past five

344.96 --> 348.23999999999995
it was not that great yeah it was not

347.199 --> 350.72
good

348.24 --> 352.8
although it was worth it because it was

350.72 --> 356.16
just very amusing

352.8 --> 358.40000000000003
and it was also on the 24 7 discord very

356.16 --> 358.40000000000003
late

360.8 --> 364.72
but it was interesting so miggy was at

364.16 --> 367.44
some

364.72 --> 367.91900000000004
was going after somebody neutral and

367.44 --> 371.84
then

367.919 --> 372.56
there was a newbie and then eventually a

371.84 --> 377.039
baller

372.56 --> 379.12
on there and i was part of that

377.039 --> 380.479
but anyway that was very late before

379.12 --> 383.12
that

380.479 --> 385.36
uh yeah flat of debates with the kind of

383.12 --> 389.039
slow start it was weird though

385.36 --> 391.28000000000003
that it was just me tenth man and nathan

389.039 --> 394.31899999999996
for like

391.28 --> 395.19899999999996
first half hour of the live show even so

394.319 --> 397.52000000000004
that was kind of

395.199 --> 399.199
odd that it took everybody a long time

397.52 --> 401.68
to get in there but then when the after

399.199 --> 405.12
show started

401.68 --> 406.8
yeah a lot of the others came in

405.12 --> 408.88
it's kind of void before that this is

406.8 --> 413.759
weird it's not something i'm used to

408.88 --> 416.0
on a monday let's see how that is today

413.759 --> 416.96000000000004
uh anyway i managed to catch own

416.0 --> 421.199
benjamin again

416.96 --> 424.479
live and that was a lot of fun

421.199 --> 427.52000000000004
a lot of comedic things in there

424.479 --> 429.12
and also yeah i just thought it was

427.52 --> 432.24
really freaking funny that

429.12 --> 435.36
denmark bear apparently makes

432.24 --> 438.08
music like sort of a

435.36 --> 439.91900000000004
radiohead style a little bit more

438.08 --> 443.52
hippie-ish maybe

439.919 --> 446.08
and he managed to actually like slip

443.52 --> 447.75899999999996
something by big bear's attention so big

446.08 --> 451.68
bear presented

447.759 --> 455.039
the video clip on top of that

451.68 --> 457.36
and then we all concluded wait

455.039 --> 458.639
did somebody in the video just have

457.36 --> 461.84000000000003
robot sex

458.639 --> 462.40000000000003
you know manually was what this is robot

461.84 --> 465.84
sex

462.4 --> 469.84
i didn't see that oh no so it slipped it

465.84 --> 469.84
by denmark there slipped one by him

470.08 --> 476.08
no that was just really funny because

472.879 --> 476.08000000000004
yeah we know big bear

476.639 --> 481.52
he doesn't like like any kind of

479.039 --> 485.12
pornography or sex situation and he said

481.52 --> 485.68
in anything and denmark basically

485.12 --> 488.4
slipped it

485.68 --> 488.40000000000003
under his nose

489.44 --> 494.4
that that thing about it was funny

496.08 --> 501.44
uh right so that yeah that's pretty much

499.44 --> 504.56
the summary for what i did yesterday

501.44 --> 507.84
not too

504.56 --> 507.84
detailed the notes

509.44 --> 512.319
hey dark steve

518.839 --> 521.839
right

522.479 --> 526.72
yesterday's show i thought still was

524.399 --> 529.04
plenty of good

526.72 --> 529.839
it was good that there was so much

529.04 --> 534.8
activity

529.839 --> 538.32
like there was just people really

534.8 --> 538.3199999999999
asking questions and stuff

541.519 --> 545.36
and yeah i hope to do it again today

547.279 --> 552.72
it is even 24 7. yeah well i go there

550.16 --> 554.56
sometimes it's just that

552.72 --> 557.279
a lot of the time i do feel a bit

554.56 --> 560.56
superfluous or

557.279 --> 561.36
like i take up too much room like i'd go

560.56 --> 564.16
there and just say

561.36 --> 564.8000000000001
like oh okay i'm open for inquiry like

564.16 --> 567.6
on my

564.8 --> 569.3599999999999
rectangular looping nobody really seems

567.6 --> 571.519
to like to entertain that they just

569.36 --> 573.6800000000001
like to think it's really funny and all

571.519 --> 573.68
that

574.32 --> 579.6800000000001
and with them i mean pretty much

577.279 --> 583.12
everybody i know

579.68 --> 585.8389999999999
it's just that my closer friends seem to

583.12 --> 587.92
respect it to not make fun of it they

585.839 --> 589.9200000000001
get that it's very serious but

587.92 --> 592.64
i don't yeah if you know anybody else

589.92 --> 595.04
out there that actually thinks

592.64 --> 597.76
anything about rectangular looping

595.04 --> 597.76
conception

597.92 --> 602.4799999999999
other than oh yeah sure i'll listen

602.88 --> 606.399
does anybody out there have an opinion

604.8 --> 609.8389999999999
about it at all

606.399 --> 612.959
other than i don't get it it's stupid

609.839 --> 612.9590000000001
because i didn't understand

615.839 --> 623.2790000000001
but uh

619.839 --> 625.36
yeah it was interesting being on a 24 7

623.279 --> 627.68
with especially like if there are

625.36 --> 630.0790000000001
newcomers there

627.68 --> 633.8389999999999
that makes it really interesting hey

630.079 --> 633.8389999999999
zack sterling good to see you again

635.519 --> 640.399
yeah did you look up the older

638.48 --> 642.88
rectangular looping videos from the

640.399 --> 646.0
flutter talks

642.88 --> 649.279
zack sterling did recommend you do

646.0 --> 652.48
that oh hello by the way

649.279 --> 661.8389999999999
jm laylor

652.48 --> 661.839
good to see you

695.519 --> 703.839
yeah that's right j.m laylor you have a

699.04 --> 703.8389999999999
very inconvenient name

704.8 --> 709.76
ah you watched bible literally last

706.56 --> 712.3199999999999
night okay was it good

709.76 --> 712.3199999999999
i didn't

715.44 --> 720.9590000000001
did i even see she was live what was it

718.72 --> 720.9590000000001
live

721.76 --> 723.92
no

725.279 --> 733.76
so you just watched a video i guess

731.279 --> 735.2
that wasn't live all right i have a head

733.76 --> 738.16
or i would have had

735.2 --> 738.1600000000001
a notification

741.519 --> 746.16
ten of her videos holy okay

747.839 --> 751.2790000000001
that's a lot

751.36 --> 759.839
i guess you were really interested well

753.519 --> 759.839
good for you

761.279 --> 765.76
somehow you missed a rectangular looping

763.519 --> 766.48
conversation well which conversations

765.76 --> 769.2
exactly

766.48 --> 771.04
because i've never had a conversation

769.2 --> 774.48
with somebody about it

771.04 --> 775.5999999999999
iron fe like literally that's not how it

774.48 --> 777.76
seems to happen

775.6 --> 778.88
when it's brought up it's just me

777.76 --> 782.399
talking about it

778.88 --> 784.639
trying to explain it to others

782.399 --> 785.76
and i don't even hear from others like

784.639 --> 788.9590000000001
oh

785.76 --> 790.24
now i get it no it's just me explaining

788.959 --> 792.959
it nobody

790.24 --> 794.0
even really responds they just wait for

792.959 --> 796.88
me to finish

794.0 --> 798.16
and then declare i don't get it or i

796.88 --> 799.92
don't think it's likely

798.16 --> 803.04
that's really it that's the only

799.92 --> 803.04
response i've ever had

805.92 --> 809.279
just as soon as they seem to understand

807.76 --> 812.639
it they just outright

809.279 --> 816.079
reject it and

812.639 --> 817.76
i'm literally talking about everyone i

816.079 --> 821.92
know

817.76 --> 824.079
including like nathan and all of them

821.92 --> 825.199
chocolate they all think it's it's

824.079 --> 828.079
ridiculous

825.199 --> 829.68
they don't know what it is they don't

828.079 --> 832.3199999999999
know if it is a disc

829.68 --> 834.2399999999999
but rectangular looping of course not of

832.32 --> 836.9590000000001
course it's ridiculous that makes no

834.24 --> 840.0790000000001
sense if space is not linear and

836.959 --> 842.16
looping and no of course not that's

840.079 --> 844.0
just something that is very much

842.16 --> 848.399
unwanted apparently

844.0 --> 848.399
so yeah great

851.6 --> 858.32
now people much much much rather just

854.88 --> 863.4399999999999
assume they're sitting in a domed disc

858.32 --> 863.44
world and leave it to that it seems

864.0 --> 867.6
no it's not a crossbow mark for [ __ ]

867.04 --> 869.519
sake

867.6 --> 871.12
timing you out for that you should know

869.519 --> 875.04
better you've been following my

871.12 --> 885.839
show for at least four years

875.04 --> 885.8389999999999
for [ __ ] sake

885.89 --> 888.9499999999999
[Music]

894.19 --> 899.6
[Music]

910.839 --> 913.839
uh

914.24 --> 918.48
it is a concept go it is my concept is

918.24 --> 921.92
it

918.48 --> 923.1990000000001
oh it's mine so it's just mine all right

921.92 --> 926.56
well there you go

923.199 --> 927.04
it's already a designation a whole range

926.56 --> 929.199
of

927.04 --> 930.8
possible outcomes of what the realm is

929.199 --> 935.12
like it is

930.8 --> 938.4799999999999
mine apparently i made it up

935.12 --> 940.639
it's just my little ideas

938.48 --> 942.48
right well that's that's exactly what i

940.639 --> 944.639
mean cameron k

942.48 --> 946.399
kamikaze gilmore that's exactly what i

944.639 --> 948.639
mean people don't even

946.399 --> 952.32
think it is a possibility they just

948.639 --> 955.04
think it's arwyn's kooky little ideas

952.32 --> 956.24
yeah well no wonder people don't talk

955.04 --> 959.519
about it if it's

956.24 --> 962.16
just my cookie little idea

959.519 --> 963.12
stupid little arwyn fantasy science

962.16 --> 965.519
fiction oh

963.12 --> 967.399
because it can't be real because it's

965.519 --> 971.04
not straightforward forward

967.399 --> 971.04
intuitively easy

971.68 --> 983.8389999999999
right because everybody's pathetic

975.199 --> 983.8389999999999
humans pathetic

986.0 --> 990.88
but then again who the freak am i trying

988.0 --> 990.88
to fool you know

991.68 --> 994.7199999999999
unless massive amounts of people can't

994.24 --> 997.92
even

994.72 --> 998.72
understand basic perspective and who

997.92 --> 1002.079
might

998.72 --> 1004.0
complain about everybody in the freaking

1002.079 --> 1006.399
world

1004.0 --> 1007.36
not even close getting close to

1006.399 --> 1010.72
understanding

1007.36 --> 1014.399
the conception of a looping space

1010.72 --> 1014.399
right yeah

1020.8 --> 1027.6
right okay here we go again yeah

1024.16 --> 1027.6000000000001
get well better soon

1034.72 --> 1039.919
where do i find videos about it relevant

1036.959 --> 1042.4
to fe well squares cosmology

1039.919 --> 1044.4
is one of the channels i can't link to

1042.4 --> 1047.1200000000001
it anymore because youtube likes to

1044.4 --> 1048.4
[ __ ] their audience right youtube

1047.12 --> 1051.4399999999998
doesn't want

1048.4 --> 1054.48
you to use youtube to get informed

1051.44 --> 1054.8600000000001
so i can't post links anymore

1054.48 --> 1057.94
right

1054.86 --> 1057.9399999999998
[Music]

1061.76 --> 1068.16
but square earth cosmology

1065.44 --> 1070.4
yeah used to be free energy that's right

1068.16 --> 1072.559
but it's called squares cosmology

1070.4 --> 1075.1200000000001
that person has it so it has their own

1072.559 --> 1077.76
ideas in a very set

1075.12 --> 1078.7199999999998
like they've made up their mind exactly

1077.76 --> 1081.6
how the realm

1078.72 --> 1083.52
supposed to be like they have the exact

1081.6 --> 1085.84
measurements of their looping realm

1083.52 --> 1088.24
concept or something

1085.84 --> 1089.039
but don't care about that in the

1088.24 --> 1091.28
slightest

1089.039 --> 1093.36
because it's just another model it's

1091.28 --> 1096.96
completely useless to me

1093.36 --> 1100.559
but at least he's had really good

1096.96 --> 1102.48
visual animations of

1100.559 --> 1104.72
literally of the rectangular looping

1102.48 --> 1108.799
realm in itself and that

1104.72 --> 1110.799
part is really good as for

1108.799 --> 1112.08
where can you find more videos about it

1110.799 --> 1113.9189999999999
well my channel

1112.08 --> 1115.12
my channel is the only channel other

1113.919 --> 1117.039
than free energy

1115.12 --> 1119.28
that i even know that talks about it

1117.039 --> 1121.76
other than just a couple of

1119.28 --> 1123.6789999999999
words about it oh like oh yeah there is

1121.76 --> 1127.679
this concept

1123.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
right i'm the only channel i know

1127.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
besides free energy and yeah

1145.84 --> 1150.08
flat water flood earth yeah he's great

1149.039 --> 1153.76
but he doesn't talk

1150.08 --> 1154.0
about the he doesn't talk about looping

1153.76 --> 1157.84
at

1154.0 --> 1160.48
all he's only referencing

1157.84 --> 1163.4399999999998
cosmology interpretations through the

1160.48 --> 1165.919
book of enoch and all that

1163.44 --> 1166.88
so he basically claims it's sort of a

1165.919 --> 1169.2
disc too

1166.88 --> 1171.5200000000002
because they all do it every [ __ ]

1169.2 --> 1174.96
person out there claims the [ __ ]

1171.52 --> 1178.48
disc always that [ __ ] disc

1174.96 --> 1179.3600000000001
no proof for a [ __ ] disc so everybody

1178.48 --> 1182.4
just

1179.36 --> 1185.039
it's a disc it's a disc it's a [ __ ]

1182.4 --> 1186.24
circle circle off the air so it must be

1185.039 --> 1188.48
a [ __ ] disc

1186.24 --> 1189.6
everybody in the [ __ ] world wants to

1188.48 --> 1193.2
think the earth is a

1189.6 --> 1197.84
[ __ ] disk always the same

1193.2 --> 1200.88
always why because map projection

1197.84 --> 1201.6
right map projection yeah you can't deal

1200.88 --> 1204.48
with it

1201.6 --> 1205.52
you can't deal that it doesn't reveal

1204.48 --> 1208.24
the literal

1205.52 --> 1209.6
look of it so you just assume it's that

1208.24 --> 1213.36
anyway

1209.6 --> 1216.0
like physicality assumption by a squared

1213.36 --> 1217.6789999999999
everybody in the [ __ ] world just

1216.0 --> 1220.64
wants to accept it's a

1217.679 --> 1221.6000000000001
[ __ ] disk and at some point they'd

1220.64 --> 1224.64
probably just

1221.6 --> 1227.52
rather be shot in the face then

1224.64 --> 1229.6000000000001
consider that it might not be a literal

1227.52 --> 1233.039
disk

1229.6 --> 1234.6
because people are stupid and lazy as

1233.039 --> 1239.52
[ __ ]

1234.6 --> 1239.52
intellectual lazy to be specific

1240.64 --> 1243.689
[Music]

1247.12 --> 1251.36
flat earth is not infinite infinity is

1250.96 --> 1255.52
not

1251.36 --> 1258.7199999999998
physically possible it's a self

1255.52 --> 1264.24
defeating statement

1258.72 --> 1267.76
there is no infinity in physicality

1264.24 --> 1270.0
that's a physical impossibility consider

1267.76 --> 1270.0
that

1270.72 --> 1277.2
what the okay

1273.84 --> 1280.24
tinten vein who are you

1277.2 --> 1282.72
and how the hell did you get a wrench

1280.24 --> 1291.84
did you rename your account because i

1282.72 --> 1291.84
have never seen your name before

1310.799 --> 1318.48
i don't recognize you when did i give

1313.52 --> 1320.32
you a wrench

1318.48 --> 1322.4
square with the circle cut out that

1320.32 --> 1322.799
doesn't make any sense sex sterling

1322.4 --> 1326.0800000000002
that's

1322.799 --> 1329.44
literally just you thinking of pie

1326.08 --> 1332.559
and a knife that has no

1329.44 --> 1336.159
logical reference to the realm at

1332.559 --> 1339.6789999999999
all but i don't blame you because

1336.159 --> 1340.4
hey everybody else does that [ __ ] nobody

1339.679 --> 1342.96
can deal

1340.4 --> 1345.2800000000002
with the freaking reality of an

1342.96 --> 1347.8400000000001
orientation of the landmasses and ocean

1345.28 --> 1348.8799999999999
nobody in this [ __ ] world can do it

1347.84 --> 1354.559
everybody is

1348.88 --> 1357.679
pathetic everybody including all of you

1354.559 --> 1375.84
i'm not angry at you i'm just really

1357.679 --> 1375.8400000000001
[ __ ] frustrated really frustrated

1383.52 --> 1385.9189999999999
okay

1387.6 --> 1394.32
i just want somebody to be able to

1390.76 --> 1397.76
explain to me in a way

1394.32 --> 1401.2
that is halfway decently understandable

1397.76 --> 1402.1589999999999
what rectangular looping even is what it

1401.2 --> 1404.64
means

1402.159 --> 1405.5200000000002
so that i know that once i die

1404.64 --> 1408.0
eventually

1405.52 --> 1408.8799999999999
it's not going to be forgotten as a

1408.0 --> 1412.32
concept

1408.88 --> 1415.5200000000002
forever because literally nobody in the

1412.32 --> 1418.559
[ __ ] world understands it

1415.52 --> 1418.559
yeah how about that

1427.84 --> 1432.0
i just want people to be able to

1430.96 --> 1434.96
understand

1432.0 --> 1437.6
what it is and that it's not just

1434.96 --> 1440.159
ridiculous fantasy

1437.6 --> 1440.9599999999998
that it is a possibility and that it

1440.159 --> 1444.0
reveals

1440.96 --> 1447.1200000000001
critical gaps in the knowledge

1444.0 --> 1450.159
of mankind still existing

1447.12 --> 1452.8799999999999
to this day critical gaps

1450.159 --> 1455.679
in knowledge that people just per

1452.88 --> 1459.7600000000002
default overlook

1455.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
like super default it's it's just

1459.76 --> 1473.84
frustrating to no end

1474.559 --> 1478.32
that's soon oh never heard of it sounds

1476.72 --> 1481.279
a bit strange to me i've only been

1478.32 --> 1484.32
talking about it and dedicating

1481.279 --> 1486.88
great like a few hundred

1484.32 --> 1487.52
hours to its concept in the last four

1486.88 --> 1490.48
years

1487.52 --> 1493.6
that's all so why would i expect anybody

1490.48 --> 1495.679
to have heard about it

1493.6 --> 1497.4399999999998
right especially if you got a wrench why

1495.679 --> 1501.2
would i expect that you've ever

1497.44 --> 1504.0
heard of it

1501.2 --> 1504.96
because why would anybody care it's just

1504.0 --> 1507.36
a word

1504.96 --> 1509.76
why would you try to figure out what it

1507.36 --> 1509.76
means

1511.919 --> 1515.919
yeah i know [ __ ] waddle you are new here

1513.919 --> 1516.4
and and just being a bit of a dick here

1515.919 --> 1519.679
and

1516.4 --> 1522.88
trying to rattle people's cages because

1519.679 --> 1524.4
like why why doesn't anybody care why

1522.88 --> 1526.4
half of you don't even [ __ ]

1524.4 --> 1530.5590000000002
understand when i'm talking about it

1526.4 --> 1530.5590000000002
when i talk about it regularly

1530.96 --> 1537.4
what my interdimensional talk

1534.08 --> 1540.48
is more [ __ ] comprehensible than the

1537.4 --> 1542.5590000000002
orientation of the realm

1540.48 --> 1543.679
you understand inter-dimensional

1542.559 --> 1546.96
timeless [ __ ]

1543.679 --> 1549.44
better than the freaking orientation of

1546.96 --> 1557.8400000000001
the physical thing we're standing in

1549.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
now that's not frustrating at all

1558.799 --> 1562.48
yeah well if you're like flustered and

1560.799 --> 1563.279
you're like i don't know why you're so

1562.48 --> 1564.64
angry

1563.279 --> 1566.88
i don't understand what you're talking

1564.64 --> 1569.039
about well then i'm not talking to you

1566.88 --> 1571.1200000000001
or maybe i am i don't give a [ __ ]

1569.039 --> 1573.44
anymore it's just

1571.12 --> 1574.4799999999998
why am i even doing this why am i

1573.44 --> 1578.159
spending

1574.48 --> 1578.159
two hours a day

1578.679 --> 1583.44
perpetually and the people that come

1581.679 --> 1586.159
here on a daily basis

1583.44 --> 1599.8400000000001
still don't know what the [ __ ] i'm

1586.159 --> 1599.8400000000001
talking about

1602.64 --> 1614.96
you do prove it to me

1612.799 --> 1616.08
you don't have to catch my show all the

1614.96 --> 1619.52
time

1616.08 --> 1621.9189999999999
it's not about it's not it's not like a

1619.52 --> 1622.679
guarantee you watch my show two hours

1621.919 --> 1627.1200000000001
then

1622.679 --> 1628.8400000000001
automatically as i programmed myself or

1627.12 --> 1631.279
whatever you

1628.84 --> 1631.84
undoubtedly understand the things that i

1631.279 --> 1634.88
talk about

1631.84 --> 1635.76
no no it's about hey pay freaking

1634.88 --> 1638.7990000000002
attention

1635.76 --> 1641.919
in class complicated subject

1638.799 --> 1645.039
yeah it's not just oh you have to be

1641.919 --> 1647.1200000000001
there or you're going on the absence

1645.039 --> 1649.36
list no you actually have to

1647.12 --> 1650.1589999999999
[ __ ] pay attention if you don't get

1649.36 --> 1654.32
it you ask

1650.159 --> 1657.919
questions so you do

1654.32 --> 1658.399
get it that's the issue so everybody's

1657.919 --> 1660.3200000000002
just

1658.399 --> 1661.6789999999999
thinking everything is amusement you

1660.32 --> 1664.1589999999999
don't get it

1661.679 --> 1666.3990000000001
superficial inquiry oh you still didn't

1664.159 --> 1669.679
get it well then just forget about it

1666.399 --> 1683.84
just move on to the next superficially

1669.679 --> 1683.8400000000001
easily digestible thing

1685.36 --> 1690.1589999999999
what you know it's rectangular looping

1688.24 --> 1693.84
really

1690.159 --> 1696.3990000000001
voynich how do you

1693.84 --> 1698.32
know it's rectangular looping i don't

1696.399 --> 1701.279
know if it's rectangular looping

1698.32 --> 1703.12
i just think it has grain design

1701.279 --> 1706.0
potential

1703.12 --> 1706.399
from a designer's perspective and it

1706.0 --> 1709.44
does

1706.399 --> 1712.08
absolutely remain a possibility

1709.44 --> 1716.72
i'm not saying it is it's just that it

1712.08 --> 1716.72
seems very unlikely to be a literal disc

1721.52 --> 1728.0
oh dear yes sleeping warrior sure i've

1725.52 --> 1731.44
seen that

1728.0 --> 1733.84
yeah justice for another 100

1731.44 --> 1736.0800000000002
000 people that are going to undergo the

1733.84 --> 1739.4399999999998
same [ __ ]

1736.08 --> 1741.279
dude there's gonna be more nurses dying

1739.44 --> 1742.64
and doctor or probably mostly just

1741.279 --> 1744.799
nurses there's going to be a

1742.64 --> 1746.3200000000002
record amount of nurses that are going

1744.799 --> 1748.24
to die

1746.32 --> 1749.84
because they are going to be around

1748.24 --> 1751.039
they're going to have that vaccine

1749.84 --> 1753.9189999999999
rammed

1751.039 --> 1755.84
into them and they'll probably be like

1753.919 --> 1758.0800000000002
oh but i cannot give up my

1755.84 --> 1760.08
function because people need me so they

1758.08 --> 1762.1589999999999
risk death

1760.08 --> 1764.799
for something completely useless

1762.159 --> 1766.88
probably sterilize themselves

1764.799 --> 1768.08
yeah so there's probably like hundreds

1766.88 --> 1770.0800000000002
of thousands if not

1768.08 --> 1771.6
millions of nurses around the world are

1770.08 --> 1773.1999999999998
gonna die

1771.6 --> 1775.84
because this [ __ ] government's

1773.2 --> 1779.2
everywhere just trying to ram that [ __ ]

1775.84 --> 1780.9599999999998
down your throat under penalty oh

1779.2 --> 1782.799
otherwise you're gonna be an outcast

1780.96 --> 1784.3990000000001
you're not gonna have a job and

1782.799 --> 1786.32
threats beyond that like oh you're not

1784.399 --> 1787.6789999999999
even going to be able to buy food and

1786.32 --> 1791.039
[ __ ] yeah the threats are

1787.679 --> 1794.88
unlimited unlimited

1791.039 --> 1798.24
threats beyond any [ __ ] nazi movie

1794.88 --> 1802.0800000000002
you've ever seen unlimited

1798.24 --> 1805.6
threats understand unlimited

1802.08 --> 1808.559
threats no limitation

1805.6 --> 1808.9599999999998
in your conception to how far they will

1808.559 --> 1811.55
go

1808.96 --> 1813.52
unlimited threats

1811.55 --> 1816.72
[Music]

1813.52 --> 1819.36
and yeah people will fall for that

1816.72 --> 1820.96
because this world has been made to turn

1819.36 --> 1824.36
everybody compliant

1820.96 --> 1828.159
and that compliance is now going to help

1824.36 --> 1830.32
exterminate people for the eugenicists

1828.159 --> 1834.0800000000002
which is what they designed the whole

1830.32 --> 1837.8799999999999
covet mind control lockdown [ __ ] for

1834.08 --> 1839.1999999999998
specifically that to route out and

1837.88 --> 1843.0390000000002
exterminate

1839.2 --> 1846.0800000000002
the compliant you understand

1843.039 --> 1850.32
eugenicists use covet lockdown

1846.08 --> 1854.399
to exterminate the compliant

1850.32 --> 1854.399
that is what is happening right now

1860.24 --> 1864.08
no i don't wear a face mask not at the

1863.519 --> 1868.159
grocery

1864.08 --> 1868.559
store it's weird i was asked by somebody

1868.159 --> 1871.279
there

1868.559 --> 1872.799
once they basically asked her you're not

1871.279 --> 1874.72
wearing a mask

1872.799 --> 1877.279
probably because out of principle is it

1874.72 --> 1880.08
oh absolutely

1877.279 --> 1880.559
not that it yeah so they don't push me

1880.08 --> 1882.72
for it

1880.559 --> 1884.1589999999999
i wonder if i'm gonna get them into

1882.72 --> 1886.3990000000001
trouble for it

1884.159 --> 1887.3600000000001
i don't know even what the policy for

1886.399 --> 1890.6399999999999
that it's a

1887.36 --> 1893.76
big big big store franchise

1890.64 --> 1896.3990000000001
so i wonder if they have basically done

1893.76 --> 1897.76
what i even suggested by saying no we

1896.399 --> 1901.5189999999998
are going to ignore

1897.76 --> 1901.519
everything all the regulations

1903.12 --> 1909.4399999999998
or maybe it is just not what they say

1906.32 --> 1912.6399999999999
it is it's so it's like the

1909.44 --> 1915.2
whole rule system is so weird and

1912.64 --> 1916.88
contractual i don't even understand

1915.2 --> 1918.72
completely what the rules even are

1916.88 --> 1921.919
supposed to be anymore i don't

1918.72 --> 1924.159
understand it at all it's such a giant

1921.919 --> 1924.159
mess

1928.399 --> 1932.399
ah aren't you all happy aren't you all

1930.88 --> 1935.3600000000001
just relieved

1932.399 --> 1935.76
finally we can talk about some subject

1935.36 --> 1939.039
that

1935.76 --> 1940.96
everybody in the [ __ ] world and their

1939.039 --> 1943.039
grandchild and grandma is [ __ ]

1940.96 --> 1945.6000000000001
talking about all the time

1943.039 --> 1948.0
non-stop for over a year aren't you just

1945.6 --> 1948.48
relieved we're talking about kuronu

1948.0 --> 1950.559
again

1948.48 --> 1952.48
about kuronu because we never want to

1950.559 --> 1954.32
stop talking about kuronu

1952.48 --> 1956.08
why would you talk about rectangular

1954.32 --> 1958.72
looping [ __ ] right

1956.08 --> 1962.6399999999999
that's just difficult well give me a

1958.72 --> 1964.48
headache ouchie ouchie right let's talk

1962.64 --> 1966.88
about kuronu again because

1964.48 --> 1967.84
everybody has something to say about

1966.88 --> 1971.519
keronu

1967.84 --> 1974.559
then you feel so involved for you can

1971.519 --> 1978.24
too talk about karanu you are too

1974.559 --> 1981.039
part of the rest oh makes you feel so

1978.24 --> 1983.039
so much better about yourself instead of

1981.039 --> 1984.799
talking about a subject that's actually

1983.039 --> 1988.48
difficult that you actually have to

1984.799 --> 1988.48
focus on and try to understand

1988.84 --> 1991.84
right

2000.64 --> 2004.24
no i'm not gonna rebrand i'm not gonna

2002.88 --> 2009.2
use it

2004.24 --> 2009.2
it's 100 mind control fakery

2017.679 --> 2025.519
look i'm my responses in general are

2022.08 --> 2028.559
like highly dramatic and unsuitable

2025.519 --> 2028.96
for weeny country which is what i live

2028.559 --> 2031.279
in

2028.96 --> 2032.48
weenie country the country of

2031.279 --> 2036.399
bureaucratic

2032.48 --> 2037.84
weenies that whine all day and squirt

2036.399 --> 2039.76
and think they're accomplishing

2037.84 --> 2042.72
something weenie country

2039.76 --> 2044.32
the netherlands right so as much of the

2042.72 --> 2047.279
rest of europe

2044.32 --> 2048.7999999999997
my responses would be okay this is

2047.279 --> 2051.679
illegal

2048.8 --> 2052.32
it's a scam a provable scam and

2051.679 --> 2055.44
everybody

2052.32 --> 2056.32
involved will have their financial

2055.44 --> 2058.879
records

2056.32 --> 2060.32
prodded figured out how they are

2058.879 --> 2062.48
involved and then

2060.32 --> 2064.0
they are basically going to be put on a

2062.48 --> 2066.56
list

2064.0 --> 2067.72
right then when it's all over and

2066.56 --> 2070.7999999999997
actually

2067.72 --> 2074.0789999999997
proven without any doubt

2070.8 --> 2075.9190000000003
that it is the scam that we know it

2074.079 --> 2077.119
is then all those people are going to be

2075.919 --> 2079.2799999999997
held responsible

2077.119 --> 2081.359
and any pro financial profits they got

2079.28 --> 2084.7200000000003
out of participating in the scam

2081.359 --> 2087.679
will be used to re reparate

2084.72 --> 2088.0789999999997
reparations for the damages that have

2087.679 --> 2091.44
actually

2088.079 --> 2093.9190000000003
been caused by all this [ __ ] right

2091.44 --> 2095.28
that's my approach like absolute

2093.919 --> 2098.72
forbidding

2095.28 --> 2099.0400000000004
it's not oh some people might believe it

2098.72 --> 2102.7999999999997
no

2099.04 --> 2106.56
it's it's forbidden it's fake you're not

2102.8 --> 2110.32
allowed to entertain the proven

2106.56 --> 2112.16
scam on media not allowed

2110.32 --> 2113.3590000000004
oh [ __ ] free speech with your

2112.16 --> 2118.0
delusion well

2113.359 --> 2121.7599999999998
[ __ ] you how about that

2118.0 --> 2122.0
that's my approach not very useful right

2121.76 --> 2125.0400000000004
in

2122.0 --> 2127.04
weenie country and it's

2125.04 --> 2129.04
yeah what do you do what do you do when

2127.04 --> 2132.32
the only solutions left

2129.04 --> 2136.079
are to destroy free speech

2132.32 --> 2137.92
what do you do then you know

2136.079 --> 2139.6800000000003
that's the problem that's the biggest

2137.92 --> 2141.6800000000003
problem it's the problem of

2139.68 --> 2142.8799999999997
the darkness that they are trying to do

2141.68 --> 2145.5989999999997
they are trying to drive

2142.88 --> 2148.079
everybody insane so that we all get so

2145.599 --> 2150.88
desperate that the only solution left

2148.079 --> 2151.52
is to abandon the constitution for any

2150.88 --> 2153.92
reason

2151.52 --> 2155.28
and then once we do that they crack down

2153.92 --> 2157.28
so hard

2155.28 --> 2158.88
that we'll never recover and then we

2157.28 --> 2162.0
have no excuses

2158.88 --> 2164.2400000000002
left to even appeal

2162.0 --> 2165.599
to the constitution in free speech

2164.24 --> 2167.7599999999998
because we already

2165.599 --> 2170.0
tried to break it to get out of the

2167.76 --> 2172.48
situation that's what they want to do

2170.0 --> 2174.48
and that's why the only solution is a

2172.48 --> 2175.359
final solution and that is the moment it

2174.48 --> 2178.32
happens

2175.359 --> 2180.16
it's time to round up and execute a

2178.32 --> 2182.8
whole bunch of people

2180.16 --> 2183.52
a whole bunch like they have to be

2182.8 --> 2186.8
routed

2183.52 --> 2189.599
permanently or there is not going to be

2186.8 --> 2192.96
a way to get out of it alive

2189.599 --> 2196.2400000000002
so once that happens millions will die

2192.96 --> 2198.96
will must die they must be removed

2196.24 --> 2200.16
out of the system so that they cannot

2198.96 --> 2203.44
fester on

2200.16 --> 2205.1189999999997
and that's the only way it could be

2203.44 --> 2205.76
quickly resolved and it's going to leave

2205.119 --> 2209.359
a whole

2205.76 --> 2213.0400000000004
giant mess a giant giant pile of

2209.359 --> 2216.7999999999997
bad karma stinky situations regret

2213.04 --> 2219.359
and shame that's what i see

2216.8 --> 2220.48
so it's just gonna fester on forever

2219.359 --> 2222.72
until everybody

2220.48 --> 2225.119
peoples just start committing suicide

2222.72 --> 2228.3999999999996
because they're going insane from the

2225.119 --> 2231.04
crazy hardcore lies that are being

2228.4 --> 2233.92
spread out over everybody

2231.04 --> 2235.92
or we crack down on free speech and take

2233.92 --> 2239.6800000000003
down the scumbags and

2235.92 --> 2241.6800000000003
execute them all right who's gonna do

2239.68 --> 2243.839
that right who's gonna do that

2241.68 --> 2246.16
yeah all the everybody's just like oh no

2243.839 --> 2247.2799999999997
no i'm the nazi if i'm gonna do that

2246.16 --> 2250.24
then i'm the nazi

2247.28 --> 2251.8390000000004
i'm gonna be executed in nuremberg trial

2250.24 --> 2254.16
because now i'm the batman and

2251.839 --> 2256.16
everybody in the [ __ ] world and their

2254.16 --> 2257.839
grandma's gonna point at me for being

2256.16 --> 2260.3999999999996
the batman now

2257.839 --> 2261.2
because i tried to do something about it

2260.4 --> 2263.92
right

2261.2 --> 2270.64
yeah that's where we're at that's where

2263.92 --> 2274.96
we're at

2270.64 --> 2277.839
to either endure the mind control

2274.96 --> 2279.92
and let it destroy this slightly

2277.839 --> 2283.04
mentally weaker

2279.92 --> 2286.16
or yeah break it

2283.04 --> 2290.96
and break it hardcore and and totally

2286.16 --> 2292.3999999999996
resolve it which means millions of dead

2290.96 --> 2294.88
not just my country because that would

2292.4 --> 2298.0
be a significant percentage

2294.88 --> 2301.2000000000003
and then somehow try to recover from

2298.0 --> 2301.68
that because yeah when giants amounts of

2301.2 --> 2303.52
people

2301.68 --> 2305.2
die because they have turned into

2303.52 --> 2309.52
complete savage

2305.2 --> 2312.64
monsters psychological parasite

2309.52 --> 2314.56
psychopaths yeah

2312.64 --> 2317.04
i don't know any other way out of that

2314.56 --> 2319.7599999999998
than to exterminate them

2317.04 --> 2320.4
but this system as it is built does not

2319.76 --> 2323.599
allow

2320.4 --> 2327.839
that even to be a possibility so how the

2323.599 --> 2327.839
[ __ ] do you get out of that

2330.88 --> 2334.2400000000002
now i have no problem with you plugging

2332.8 --> 2336.96
anything you just can't

2334.24 --> 2340.0789999999997

2368.88 --> 2376.0

2502.72 --> 2505.52
what the [ __ ]

2506.88 --> 2512.6400000000003
okay okay i guess they hurt me then

2510.8 --> 2516.5600000000004
yesterday

2512.64 --> 2516.56
so they put it back

2520.839 --> 2526.0789999999997
huh

2523.52 --> 2526.96
oh too bad they didn't check our channel

2526.079 --> 2530.96
they didn't put

2526.96 --> 2530.96
why don't you put that back to youtube

2531.68 --> 2535.9199999999996
yeah i posted live well yesterday i

2533.76 --> 2536.88
tried that too and it wouldn't show up

2535.92 --> 2539.2000000000003
remember

2536.88 --> 2540.8
it literally would not even show up in

2539.2 --> 2544.319
the early bird chat that's how i

2540.8 --> 2548.7200000000003
noticed like it's not even visible

2544.319 --> 2548.72
but now it is what the

2549.2 --> 2553.5989999999997
so that changed apparently they took

2551.599 --> 2557.76
note

2553.599 --> 2561.3590000000004
of my criticism yesterday i guess

2557.76 --> 2564.1600000000003
weird but good

2561.359 --> 2566.0789999999997
because it was absolutely idiotic that

2564.16 --> 2569.44
they did that

2566.079 --> 2573.119
absolutely idiotic but

2569.44 --> 2577.119
for some reason now i cannot show

2653.839 --> 2658.7999999999997
i guess youtube is trying to rearrange

2656.16 --> 2660.96
its system again

2658.8 --> 2664.079
it's about damn time because it was in a

2695.04 --> 2699.44
they have been derailing the social

2697.76 --> 2703.3590000000004
media capability

2699.44 --> 2704.4
of youtube part of the things that made

2703.359 --> 2707.44
it like

2704.4 --> 2710.8
the number one system

2707.44 --> 2713.52
because it was super effective

2710.8 --> 2714.0
now they just they they removed it they

2713.52 --> 2717.7599999999998
were

2714.0 --> 2721.119
removing the standard functions to make

2717.76 --> 2721.119
it less connectable

2722.319 --> 2724.56
what

2727.599 --> 2733.839
what are you talking about mind work

2735.68 --> 2741.44

that and it can get

2750.0 --> 2753.44
pretty damn frustrated but

2753.52 --> 2756.8
i don't know what the what the issue is

2755.52 --> 2761.839
here

2756.8 --> 2761.8390000000004
did i do something wrong

2763.839 --> 2775.839
scientology religion what how

2783.359 --> 2787.7599999999998
okay so mind warp doesn't like me

2785.599 --> 2791.119
anymore now

2787.76 --> 2803.8390000000004
the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] you came

2791.119 --> 2803.839
especially by just to say that

2824.8 --> 2834.88
what the hell are you talking about

2831.839 --> 2837.68
scientology owns google what how is that

2834.88 --> 2837.6800000000003
even possible

2838.8 --> 2843.3590000000004
how can a religion own something a

2841.92 --> 2859.839
private enterprise

2843.359 --> 2859.839
that makes no sense

2877.92 --> 2882.559
you don't know about scientology yes i

2880.24 --> 2887.839
do know about scientology

2882.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
yes i do

2902.079 --> 2904.4
yes

2906.48 --> 2911.76
well scientology is an atheist religion

2909.52 --> 2911.7599999999998
so

2935.28 --> 2943.3590000000004
the well all atheists have that

2939.2 --> 2946.96
all of that that's the core

2943.359 --> 2949.119
objective of all atheism is to become

2946.96 --> 2951.52
the gods that you don't do not think

2949.119 --> 2951.52
exist

2952.48 --> 2958.319
like god's within

2955.599 --> 2971.839
ironically creation that's the whole

2958.319 --> 2971.839
point of it

2976.319 --> 2980.64
what they do behind the scenes oh you

2978.319 --> 2984.079
mean basically convert people that make

2980.64 --> 2987.5989999999997
them give them all their possessions

2984.079 --> 2987.599
and use assets

2987.68 --> 2995.52
to fund yeah their missionary type

2991.92 --> 2998.559
situation and all that

2995.52 --> 3001.119
but i don't see how they own google

2998.559 --> 3003.44
because that's like a private slash

3001.119 --> 3004.6400000000003
public enterprise i don't know if that's

3003.44 --> 3007.68
even

3004.64 --> 3010.839
allowed i don't know exactly but this is

3007.68 --> 3012.72
like the first time somebody's even

3010.839 --> 3016.0789999999997
mentioning

3012.72 --> 3019.7599999999998
scientology involvement with freaking

3016.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
google that is totally surreal

3019.76 --> 3027.8390000000004
literally that makes no sense

3054.24 --> 3057.9199999999996
but are you saying that scientology has

3056.48 --> 3061.44
gone hostile and is

3057.92 --> 3063.6800000000003
literally conquering land and taking

3061.44 --> 3066.079
things from others

3063.68 --> 3068.24
like are there now a hostile religion

3066.079 --> 3070.319
that is literally just

3068.24 --> 3071.359
conquering others is that what's

3070.319 --> 3074.8
happening is that your

3071.359 --> 3075.7599999999998
claim voynich seems a little dramatic

3074.8 --> 3079.28
there

3075.76 --> 3081.2000000000003
like to see some proof of that

3079.28 --> 3084.2400000000002
because if you are basically stating

3081.2 --> 3087.1189999999997
like oh yeah yeah scientology is now

3084.24 --> 3090.16
trying to become the new vatican that's

3087.119 --> 3090.1600000000003
quite a statement

3092.72 --> 3099.839
has been hostile no

3096.319 --> 3104.079
agenda 23 oh so scientology is the new

3099.839 --> 3104.0789999999997
world religion that's not a stretch at

3108.839 --> 3111.839
all

3114.559 --> 3120.559
it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever

3118.079 --> 3122.8390000000004
it's already the biggest religion that's

the world has not ended disappointingly

3366.72 --> 3377.7599999999998
in the air when i went to bed maybe it

3370.0 --> 3379.76
was my personal anticipation

3377.76 --> 3382.88
they're probably more rastafarian than

3379.76 --> 3391.8390000000004
scientologists what

3382.88 --> 3391.839
what this

3393.23 --> 3400.079
[Music]

3397.04 --> 3402.16
yeah random explorer that's really cute

3400.079 --> 3404.079
but yeah when a cult officially

3402.16 --> 3406.3999999999996
registers as a religion

3404.079 --> 3408.4
and gets recognition as a religion it's

3406.4 --> 3411.52
a religion

3408.4 --> 3414.4
because you know why religions

3411.52 --> 3414.4
are cults

3414.64 --> 3421.2799999999997
almost every single one of them or

3418.16 --> 3422.0789999999997
basically every one of them if it's a

3421.28 --> 3432.079
religion

3422.079 --> 3435.76
then it is a cult

3432.079 --> 3437.44
now people can colloquially call it a

3435.76 --> 3440.7200000000003
religion emphasizing

3437.44 --> 3441.28
something else about it right yeah yeah

3440.72 --> 3443.5989999999997
i know

3441.28 --> 3445.2000000000003
and no everybody loves to bring that up

3443.599 --> 3447.52
especially

3445.2 --> 3449.52
people that don't like those type of

3447.52 --> 3453.04
things and yes

3449.52 --> 3455.44
i'd agree general christianity

3453.04 --> 3456.4
and all the exoteric garbage that's put

3455.44 --> 3460.079
on top of it

3456.4 --> 3463.839
is a cult indeed

3460.079 --> 3465.76
does it mean that following the path of

3463.839 --> 3469.44
christ following that way

3465.76 --> 3472.559
the personal individual religion

3469.44 --> 3475.68
personal way of doing things is wrong

3472.559 --> 3478.559
or is a cult no it's not but the

3475.68 --> 3480.3999999999996
manifested religious traditions and all

3478.559 --> 3482.079
that [ __ ] on top of it yeah technically

3480.4 --> 3484.88
is a gulf yeah that's right

3482.079 --> 3485.76
that's what it is all religions are

3484.88 --> 3488.2400000000002
cults

3485.76 --> 3489.0400000000004
does it mean that all religions are

3488.24 --> 3491.9199999999996
totally

3489.04 --> 3493.04
wrong about everything you know a cult

3491.92 --> 3495.44
can be a cult

3493.04 --> 3496.4
can still have a good point here and

3495.44 --> 3498.88
there

3496.4 --> 3499.92
right because having a good point does

3498.88 --> 3503.119
not make it

3499.92 --> 3505.319
not a cult you understand

3503.119 --> 3508.319
so yeah that's called over

3505.319 --> 3508.319
generalization

3508.64 --> 3514.799
things can be a cult and still have

3511.68 --> 3516.48
good valuable points and data and things

3514.799 --> 3518.48
in them

3516.48 --> 3521.52
having those good things does not make

3518.48 --> 3521.52
it not a cult

screw you

3536.799 --> 3542.24
it's technical a cult is a technical

3539.76 --> 3542.2400000000002
setup

3543.44 --> 3562.4
talking about technicalities here

3559.44 --> 3563.92
right yeah because when we say cult it

3562.4 --> 3566.559
is derogatory

3563.92 --> 3568.799
because it is oh it's filled with people

3566.559 --> 3570.6400000000003
that just blindly accept some kind of

3568.799 --> 3572.16
authority or some sayings that they do

3570.64 --> 3573.5989999999997
not fully understand

3572.16 --> 3575.68
because if they would they wouldn't

3573.599 --> 3577.92
agree to it right that's what we call

3575.68 --> 3580.72
a cult and it is a derogatory

3577.92 --> 3580.7200000000003

3750.0 --> 3754.48
pretty sure nathan does not literally

3752.839 --> 3757.2799999999997
let

3754.48 --> 3759.119
i'm not even gonna go there who knows

3757.28 --> 3764.079
maybe his wife i don't know if

3759.119 --> 3764.079
it's not my business you know what i

3764.52 --> 3769.839
[Music]

3766.839 --> 3769.839
mean

3780.839 --> 3783.839
so

3808.079 --> 3811.92
you know how funny it would be if there

3810.079 --> 3813.92
was like

3811.92 --> 3815.52
i think i don't know why i came up with

3813.92 --> 3819.359
this but i'm thinking now of

3815.52 --> 3822.48
having helium balloons like

3819.359 --> 3824.0
but really spherical balloons that have

3822.48 --> 3825.52
like the ball earth on them can you

3824.0 --> 3829.92
imagine like a whole bunch of

3825.52 --> 3829.92
ball earth's literally floating around

3832.319 --> 3838.4
that's weird i don't know why he came up

3834.16 --> 3841.44
with that it's just seeing like

3838.4 --> 3844.0
just bald earths filled with helium

3841.44 --> 3844.0
floating

3850.319 --> 3857.599
no why voynich

3854.24 --> 3859.359
why why did you have to [ __ ] conjure

3857.599 --> 3863.2000000000003
that image

3859.359 --> 3864.0
you ruined it now you ruined it you made

3863.2 --> 3867.2
it into

3864.0 --> 3870.799
[ __ ] you made it into

3867.2 --> 3872.3999999999996
[ __ ] thanks thanks for ruining it

3870.799 --> 3874.72
thanks for ruining that image by

3872.4 --> 3877.119
conjuring that shitty concept

3874.72 --> 3877.7599999999998
next to it thanks that makes it funny

3877.119 --> 3881.839
now no

3877.76 --> 3881.8390000000004
it doesn't

3883.599 --> 3895.839
hey good julio pebbin good to see you

3900.85 --> 3903.929
[Music]

3906.839 --> 3909.839
ah

3923.359 --> 3929.359
right anyway uh i just thought like hey

3927.359 --> 3931.68
floating ball earth that is kind of

3929.359 --> 3931.68
funny

3931.92 --> 3938.96
especially if you could basically put

3935.76 --> 3940.7990000000004
enough helium in it but not too much

3938.96 --> 3942.319
so that it wouldn't just keep on

3940.799 --> 3945.28
floating upward but that it would kind

3942.319 --> 3945.2799999999997
of hang around

3946.64 --> 3951.839
seriously wouldn't that be kind of funny

3967.52 --> 3969.839
hmm

3973.2 --> 3977.1189999999997
face on helium balloons okay [ __ ] wuzzle

3975.68 --> 3979.839
that's

3977.119 --> 3979.839
unusual

4004.72 --> 4010.24
nathan's housekeeping questions are the

4007.359 --> 4012.0
best for ballers indeed

4010.24 --> 4013.4399999999996
although yeah the amount of ballers are

4012.0 --> 4021.839
kind of drying up though

4013.44 --> 4021.839
you know

4044.64 --> 4050.8799999999997
dry ballers

4049.44 --> 4052.64
well they're all just staying in the

4050.88 --> 4055.599
swamp now because it's

4052.64 --> 4058.64
become too dry outside of the swamp

4055.599 --> 4060.079
swamp is receding it's drying up

4058.64 --> 4063.0389999999998
so they're just trying to stay in the

4060.079 --> 4066.319
wet spots

4063.039 --> 4068.3190000000004
to ensure that they're not gonna dry up

4066.319 --> 4071.839
i think that would be good metaphor so

4068.319 --> 4075.119
that's why they're just all staying away

4071.839 --> 4076.0789999999997
that's a real shame though because it is

4075.119 --> 4079.359
so much fun

4076.079 --> 4079.3590000000004
every time they do try

4083.119 --> 4088.839
right well stevo foster that's really

4085.28 --> 4092.2400000000002
cute but energy is a concept

4088.839 --> 4095.92
so energy does not actually

4092.24 --> 4099.3589999999995
exist in the way that you have been told

4095.92 --> 4099.359
it does it's just a concept

4103.44 --> 4106.879999999999
they know they lost yeah yeah

4107.52 --> 4119.839000000001
so does everybody else

4120.88 --> 4127.6
sleeping warrior what are you doing

4124.08 --> 4130.64

4130.64 --> 4136.08

4150.08 --> 4154.48
like who freak wants to save him anyway

4157.199 --> 4161.839
you think that's even possible

4165.839 --> 4175.839
but i'll check out the video

4183.199 --> 4186.4
noble price no

4186.56 --> 4203.84
just wants a nodal price

4204.55 --> 4207.659000000001
[Music]

4222.159 --> 4230.03
all right you can you can take that from

4225.04 --> 4233.09
me if you like sleeping warrior

4230.03 --> 4233.09
[Music]

4236.56 --> 4239.599
[Music]

4243.6 --> 4247.84
this will be used okay

4248.88 --> 4259.84
oh dear

4264.159 --> 4273.839999999999
yeah yeah

4267.44 --> 4273.839999999999
like i i don't know

4275.28 --> 4278.639999999999
but the thing is look i don't at this

4278.159 --> 4281.679
point

4278.64 --> 4285.12
tony i don't even feel

4281.679 --> 4289.1990000000005
any benefit left to even

4285.12 --> 4291.84
try to prod him like this for me

4289.199 --> 4292.4
because i don't see there anything

4291.84 --> 4295.4400000000005
coming

4292.4 --> 4298.639999999999
anything viable out of his corner

4295.44 --> 4299.5199999999995
at all it's all crap there's nothing

4298.64 --> 4302.4800000000005
coming out of there

4299.52 --> 4303.280000000001
he's about on the same value level as

4302.48 --> 4306.0
pca

4303.28 --> 4307.599999999999
for me at this point right you know

4306.0 --> 4308.239
there is not going to be any more

4307.6 --> 4310.0
progress

4308.239 --> 4312.5599999999995
it's just going to be the same [ __ ]

4310.0 --> 4316.32
over and over again

4312.56 --> 4320.2390000000005
and on top of that the peer pressure

4316.32 --> 4323.199
yeah psycho tactics and all that so

4320.239 --> 4324.959999999999
prodding him will not yield any sort of

4323.199 --> 4327.199
advantage

4324.96 --> 4328.0
in my opinion that's why i just don't

4327.199 --> 4331.919999999999
want to talk about

4328.0 --> 4334.719
him anymore it's it's a waste of time

4331.92 --> 4335.4400000000005
it's just going to make him force other

4334.719 --> 4338.4800000000005
people

4335.44 --> 4340.5599999999995
to start whining again it's like oh

4338.48 --> 4342.239
somebody made a criticism now you have

4340.56 --> 4345.76
to say something bad

4342.239 --> 4347.12
about them or suffer the consequence

4345.76 --> 4348.96
that's pretty much what it will come

4347.12 --> 4353.599999999999
down to and i

4348.96 --> 4353.6
don't see the use for that anymore

4354.719 --> 4361.199
just let it fade

4357.76 --> 4361.1990000000005
just let it all fade

4370.48 --> 4375.04
bob is trying to be a wizard oh

4376.32 --> 4382.0
yeah no and i'm that kind of wizard is

4379.92 --> 4383.4400000000005
just that's not really a wizard it's an

4382.0 --> 4385.84
illusionist

4383.44 --> 4387.12
but yeah everybody knows bob's just

4385.84 --> 4390.400000000001
wants to replace

4387.12 --> 4390.88
nasa he wants to be the new nasa that's

4390.4 --> 4393.44
it

4390.88 --> 4394.0
that's what he always wanted he wants

4393.44 --> 4397.12
his

4394.0 --> 4399.44
version of just those stories for people

4397.12 --> 4400.48
to dig into that's what he wants so he

4399.44 --> 4403.28
always wanted

4400.48 --> 4403.28
i don't care

4403.76 --> 4409.92
people are realizing it

4407.6 --> 4412.719
figuring things out figuring out

4409.92 --> 4415.76
scientific method figuring out

4412.719 --> 4416.56
all these details and if they don't yeah

4415.76 --> 4419.280000000001
then

4416.56 --> 4419.679
he is exactly where they need to be they

4419.28 --> 4423.28
just

4419.679 --> 4425.679
need another cult following

4423.28 --> 4427.599999999999
they need somebody else to feed them

4425.679 --> 4430.88
just so stories of another

4427.6 --> 4434.08
brand that's it

4430.88 --> 4436.400000000001
and those people are not going to be

4434.08 --> 4437.199
persuaded they are not going to be

4436.4 --> 4439.759999999999
informed

4437.199 --> 4440.4
about the real thing because they don't

4439.76 --> 4444.08
wanna

4440.4 --> 4455.839999999999
they just want another just so story

4444.08 --> 4455.84
for their own amusement and that's it

4466.84 --> 4471.360000000001
yeah and

4468.239 --> 4473.759999999999
besides like defeat in gravity i

4471.36 --> 4476.239
i mean it's a good comment i remember

4473.76 --> 4479.679
standstone but

4476.239 --> 4483.04
defeat him like he's already defeated

4479.679 --> 4486.8
he's already defeated by making a claim

4483.04 --> 4490.239
that relies on reification so

4486.8 --> 4492.159000000001
it's i why would i need to defeat him

4490.239 --> 4493.839999999999
the arguments have already been worked

4492.159 --> 4495.599999999999
out that have already been made

4493.84 --> 4497.84
he's already defeated he's just not

4495.6 --> 4501.52
letting go he just keeps on

4497.84 --> 4504.88
trying to play the same game

4501.52 --> 4506.8
hoping that people will forget about

4504.88 --> 4507.52
what has actually been established about

4506.8 --> 4511.84
it

4507.52 --> 4511.84
that's what he's doing

4521.28 --> 4526.8
what math power then

4525.04 --> 4529.199
the note i don't know if they're even

4526.8 --> 4539.84
connected i don't think so

4529.199 --> 4539.839999999999
not sure

4541.84 --> 4545.92
that's ridiculous and guns of nephron

4545.199 --> 4549.839999999999
like

4545.92 --> 4553.52
neil neil can't stand him

4549.84 --> 4556.64
okay that's never gonna happen ever

4553.52 --> 4559.76
like new wouldn't even convert

4556.64 --> 4563.1990000000005
to his side under threat of death

4559.76 --> 4567.84
at this point so that's just a weird

4563.199 --> 4567.839999999999
thing to say

4572.08 --> 4575.92
bad enough bye bye y'all alright see you

4574.64 --> 4581.84
later here we go again

4575.92 --> 4581.84
get well better soon

4584.4 --> 4591.199
yeah and i do kind of agree

4587.52 --> 4591.1990000000005
i hope that was a parrot

4592.88 --> 4596.56
but yeah i don't think that's gonna be

4594.88 --> 4599.36
stopped

4596.56 --> 4600.88
so tony just started about this and now

4599.36 --> 4603.12
everybody's talking about it

4600.88 --> 4605.28
and that was probably tony's idea

4603.12 --> 4607.28
because tony is just trying to light

4605.28 --> 4609.5199999999995
things on fire to get a war going

4607.28 --> 4612.719
because he thinks that works

4609.52 --> 4613.120000000001
works for him does it work in the long

4612.719 --> 4616.159
run

4613.12 --> 4619.44
with the situation i don't think so

4616.159 --> 4621.12
i don't think so at all but yeah there's

4619.44 --> 4622.239
nothing really i can do about it because

4621.12 --> 4624.32
now everybody

4622.239 --> 4625.678999999999
is talking about it and joking about it

4624.32 --> 4628.639999999999
and there's nothing i can do

4625.679 --> 4628.64
really to stop it

4633.92 --> 4639.52
[Music]

4635.28 --> 4639.5199999999995
what i don't

4643.52 --> 4652.080000000001
what the [ __ ]

4650.159 --> 4656.0
zach sterling you can't seem to get

4652.08 --> 4656.0
enough flat earth forget that guy

4662.84 --> 4665.84
right

4670.56 --> 4674.400000000001
they don't even talk about that anymore

4672.4 --> 4674.879999999999
literally when is the last time they

4674.4 --> 4678.32
even

4674.88 --> 4680.2390000000005
mentioned it

4678.32 --> 4682.799999999999
all the [ __ ] do now is talk about

4680.239 --> 4686.639999999999
stupid masks and [ __ ]

4682.8 --> 4690.8
literally literally

4686.64 --> 4693.360000000001
masks freaking ether nonsense

4690.8 --> 4694.320000000001
that there has to be some kind of cause

4693.36 --> 4696.4
of gravity

4694.32 --> 4705.96
nonsense and that's it they don't even

4696.4 --> 4709.148999999999
talk about flat earth anymore

4705.96 --> 4709.149
[Music]

4711.92 --> 4716.88
you want to watch flat earth all the

4713.36 --> 4716.88
time oh it sounds like you're in

4718.32 --> 4722.239
in the entry run don't forget to get

4721.04 --> 4725.36
sleep sometimes

4722.239 --> 4725.36
it can be a problem

4727.84 --> 4731.679
when hey if you want to watch flat earth

4729.679 --> 4735.84
all the time i really do recommend you

4731.679 --> 4735.84
start to watch my flatter talks

4737.12 --> 4744.5599999999995
which is like the beginning

4740.4 --> 4747.679
of my youtube career where i did

4744.56 --> 4750.4800000000005
more themed prepared shows

4747.679 --> 4750.88
it's still all live but i like i put

4750.48 --> 4753.599999999999
down

4750.88 --> 4756.08
a lot of details in them and very

4753.6 --> 4756.08
focused

4756.159 --> 4763.839999999999
it's before the flatter 30 bird

4766.4 --> 4768.799999999999
all right

4769.76 --> 4776.159000000001
cool i'm glad you're enjoying it sex

4772.0 --> 4779.679
sterling i hope

4776.159 --> 4783.759999999999
yeah i hope

4779.679 --> 4785.36
you do kind of stay rested

4783.76 --> 4786.88
because some people that get into it

4785.36 --> 4790.719
they get really also

4786.88 --> 4793.04
paranoid and restless because of it

4790.719 --> 4794.8
but yeah from the looks of it from the

4793.04 --> 4798.48
way you sound in chat

4794.8 --> 4798.4800000000005
that is not the case with you at least

4798.96 --> 4806.32
so that's good how many shows are there

4803.04 --> 4808.56
i don't know like 30 i think

4806.32 --> 4809.599999999999
you don't have to watch them all it's

4808.56 --> 4812.719
it's also like

4809.6 --> 4816.320000000001
it's me different it's me

4812.719 --> 4819.679
much kind of i was more insecure

4816.32 --> 4822.0
i was less fluid in my talking

4819.679 --> 4823.679
so yeah there's that unfortunately but

4822.0 --> 4826.719
there's just a couple of shows and you

4823.679 --> 4829.12
will recognize them by their titles

4826.719 --> 4830.08
that were very specifically dedicated to

4829.12 --> 4832.4
explaining

4830.08 --> 4834.96
concepts especially rectangular looping

4832.4 --> 4834.96
concepts

4845.36 --> 4848.48
so i'm not telling you to watch it all

4847.28 --> 4853.04
just

4848.48 --> 4853.04
click things that seem interesting to

4858.84 --> 4861.84
you

4862.639 --> 4866.159000000001
but yeah i think i would definitely

4865.52 --> 4868.88
recommend

4866.159 --> 4869.28
you watch my first hangout like i'm

4868.88 --> 4871.28
still

4869.28 --> 4872.88
extremely impressed by my very first

4871.28 --> 4875.92
hangout because

4872.88 --> 4878.639
i was doing things

4875.92 --> 4880.4800000000005
like literally for the first time it's

4878.639 --> 4883.679
like

4880.48 --> 4888.08
all these concepts all just entered

4883.679 --> 4891.36
for the first time they put it all down

4888.08 --> 4894.0
and just how much of it has become

4891.36 --> 4896.239
relevant even to this day is just

4894.0 --> 4899.679
mind-boggling to me

4896.239 --> 4902.799999999999
like all those years ago

4899.679 --> 4903.52
still undeveloped underdeveloped and it

4902.8 --> 4905.52
was

4903.52 --> 4910.0
so on target with so many things i i

4905.52 --> 4910.0
just sized the details up so well

4910.48 --> 4914.799999999999
in my first attempt i'm really proud of

4914.239 --> 4917.599999999999
that and

4914.8 --> 4919.360000000001
a little bit surprised too like i would

4917.6 --> 4921.1990000000005
think that

4919.36 --> 4923.199
those things in the beginning would be a

4921.199 --> 4927.199
lot more messy with a lot more

4923.199 --> 4930.0
bad assumptions in them but no

4927.199 --> 4930.5599999999995
not that not that much really i wasn't

4930.0 --> 4933.84
that far

4930.56 --> 4944.400000000001
off at the start that's really

4933.84 --> 4947.84
surprising to me

4944.4 --> 4949.5199999999995
but i think that uh the names i give

4947.84 --> 4952.8
things the terminologies

4949.52 --> 4955.280000000001
those have shifted because i used other

4952.8 --> 4956.320000000001
terminologies back then also because the

4955.28 --> 4957.92
flat earth debate

4956.32 --> 4960.5599999999995
still had to go through certain

4957.92 --> 4960.56
developments

4961.12 --> 4965.5199999999995
so optics were not worked out at the

4963.199 --> 4968.799999999999
beginning during the flatter talks

4965.52 --> 4969.52
and i still believed in gravity as a

4968.8 --> 4972.8
concept

4969.52 --> 4974.2390000000005
for example so it was slightly a

4972.8 --> 4977.52
different approach but

4974.239 --> 4978.48
the mechanics of the realm layout i got

4977.52 --> 4982.0
those

4978.48 --> 4982.0
right away i got those straight

4982.159 --> 4985.759999999999
oh my thoughts on electric universe

4984.08 --> 4988.5599999999995
theory

4985.76 --> 4988.56
well which one

4988.96 --> 4993.84
because there's an electric universe

4991.679 --> 4995.36
theory that basically tries to explain

4993.84 --> 4998.56
the heliocentric

4995.36 --> 4999.599999999999
model universe through electric universe

4998.56 --> 5002.8
theory

4999.6 --> 5003.76
this is really cute but obviously wrong

5002.8 --> 5007.360000000001
because it's a

5003.76 --> 5008.4800000000005
it's a reification of lights into being

5007.36 --> 5010.32
physical objects in

5008.48 --> 5013.36
outer space and that's all just

5010.32 --> 5017.12
impossible as simple as that

5013.36 --> 5020.159
but the overall idea that

5017.12 --> 5021.44
that concept that electrics in the

5020.159 --> 5024.799999999999
universe

5021.44 --> 5028.32
or in the realm are causing things

5024.8 --> 5031.6
yeah absolutely that's what i would call

5028.32 --> 5034.799999999999
the electric ether and it's probably

5031.6 --> 5036.2390000000005
the same force that drives life and even

5034.8 --> 5038.8
consciousness

5036.239 --> 5039.599999999999
and definitely i don't see any other

5038.8 --> 5041.4400000000005
option

5039.6 --> 5043.1990000000005
any other way for it to manifest the

5041.44 --> 5046.08
celestial lights

5043.199 --> 5047.36
it's all being fed into by the electric

5046.08 --> 5050.159
ether

5047.36 --> 5051.12
so in that sense the electric universe

5050.159 --> 5053.44
theory

5051.12 --> 5057.84
from a flat earth perspective yeah it

5053.44 --> 5057.839999999999
makes a lot of sense to me

5062.0 --> 5071.84
plain earth yeah

5080.48 --> 5085.28
right okay well that's helia sent that's

5083.199 --> 5087.678999999999
an heliocentric alternative

5085.28 --> 5089.199
conception which is still absolutely

5087.679 --> 5091.36
wrong

5089.199 --> 5092.32
because yeah the presuppositional

5091.36 --> 5096.08
premise of it

5092.32 --> 5100.239
is absolute bunk it's nonsense

5096.08 --> 5104.48
still defies natural law and all that so

5100.239 --> 5108.799999999999
it's cute it's better than the original

5104.48 --> 5108.799999999999
and it's still [ __ ] so

5120.93 --> 5124.109
[Music]

5140.04 --> 5143.119
[Music]

5152.84 --> 5155.84
hmm

5161.44 --> 5167.04
i'm wondering you know there are plenty

5163.76 --> 5170.2390000000005
of people into flat earth all that

5167.04 --> 5171.679
like at some point the way we're being

5170.239 --> 5174.638999999999
treated

5171.679 --> 5175.36
by social media and all that we might

5174.639 --> 5179.1990000000005
have to just

5175.36 --> 5182.96
kind of like the right

5179.199 --> 5185.199
wing media right they had to start their

5182.96 --> 5185.76
own platforms well maybe flat earthers

5185.199 --> 5188.96
just

5185.76 --> 5188.96
need to kind of do the same

5193.199 --> 5200.48
so that it's not even to ban the ballers

5196.88 --> 5203.04
no no it's just so that we have control

5200.48 --> 5203.04
over it

5203.52 --> 5208.080000000001
and then can deal with it without

5205.6 --> 5208.88
constantly being treated as second-class

5208.08 --> 5212.32
citizens

5208.88 --> 5214.639
within the platform because that is an

5212.32 --> 5214.639
issue

5216.8 --> 5220.0
the issue is not that we do not have the

5218.96 --> 5222.159
numbers the issue

5220.0 --> 5223.6
is is that we do not have control and

5222.159 --> 5227.04
we're being treated

5223.6 --> 5227.04
as second-class citizens

5230.48 --> 5236.159
so some kind of bigger social media

5233.52 --> 5236.159000000001
platform

5236.32 --> 5242.08
like flat tube or something you know

5239.44 --> 5242.08
flat tube

5243.28 --> 5250.96
to give a wider platform

5246.56 --> 5254.0
like really more focused but still

5250.96 --> 5256.719
suitable it can't just be some shitty

5254.0 --> 5258.719
small server based social media thingy

5256.719 --> 5260.4
that's going to break after 100 members

5258.719 --> 5262.4
join

5260.4 --> 5264.32
yeah but it's difficult it's tough it's

5262.4 --> 5267.839999999999
going to cost a lot and a lot of effort

5264.32 --> 5267.84
and dedication to do that

5268.639 --> 5272.96
is it even necessary at this point i

5270.56 --> 5272.96
don't know

5273.92 --> 5277.6
but it is an idea this is not the first

5277.04 --> 5280.639
time

5277.6 --> 5283.52
ever anybody's tried that because i know

5280.639 --> 5284.8
people have tried doing that like even

5283.52 --> 5288.080000000001
years ago

5284.8 --> 5289.52
there was already animal for that i've

5288.08 --> 5295.84
just never heard of it

5289.52 --> 5295.84
actually being successful

5306.84 --> 5309.84
so

5314.159 --> 5319.5199999999995
that's right lightning electricity is

5317.36 --> 5323.04
not visible but electricity

5319.52 --> 5327.280000000001
lighting up gases will make

5323.04 --> 5329.04
the lit up gases create light

5327.28 --> 5332.639
because electricity is technically

5329.04 --> 5336.08
invisible but its influence on material

5332.639 --> 5351.84
is visible or might become visible

5336.08 --> 5351.84
if the tension is high enough correct

5358.239 --> 5365.839999999999
all right

5370.639 --> 5379.84
okay [ __ ] muzzle anyway be right back

5432.84 --> 5435.84
man

5460.84 --> 5463.84
mm-hmm

5496.96 --> 5503.84
uh yeah stevo forster i can safely say

5500.08 --> 5504.28
no absolutely not this is another one of

5503.84 --> 5506.400000000001
these

5504.28 --> 5508.08
speculations that's just absolute

5506.4 --> 5511.36
nonsense

5508.08 --> 5513.28
because you know why the stars are not

5511.36 --> 5517.04
local phenomenon

5513.28 --> 5520.159
phenomena they are not star in the jar

5517.04 --> 5523.12
literal localizable approachable

5520.159 --> 5525.12
phenomena in a specific space guess what

5523.12 --> 5526.96
the stars are not

5525.12 --> 5530.239
they're holographic they move as you

5526.96 --> 5533.28
move which absolutely excludes them

5530.239 --> 5535.04
from being a star in a jar

5533.28 --> 5537.199
it's just not the same thing it

5535.04 --> 5540.719
absolutely is not

5537.199 --> 5544.0
you understand absolutely guaranteed

5540.719 --> 5544.0
is not the same thing

5544.639 --> 5550.639
and yeah the fact that bob has been

5548.32 --> 5552.08
also trying to repeat that and bring

5550.639 --> 5554.08
that back into the table

5552.08 --> 5556.239
convinces me even more that i am

5554.08 --> 5559.199
absolutely correct about that

5556.239 --> 5560.0
that it is absolute [ __ ] does not

5559.199 --> 5562.96
match

5560.0 --> 5564.48
stars out there are not stars in a jar

5562.96 --> 5567.679
because star in a jar

5564.48 --> 5572.32
is a literal provable local

5567.679 --> 5589.84
phenomenon the stars are not

5572.32 --> 5589.84
so not the same not by a long shot

5593.6 --> 5603.84
all right

5606.719 --> 5612.159
well you can call whatever you like you

5609.92 --> 5613.04
literally i'm not denying that that does

5612.159 --> 5615.599999999999
not

5613.04 --> 5616.48
that is not a thing yeah star in a jar

5615.6 --> 5619.84
is a thing

5616.48 --> 5623.759999999999
what it isn't however is the same thing

5619.84 --> 5623.76
as the stars that we see up there

5624.32 --> 5630.639
guaranteed so very cute

5628.56 --> 5632.639
you can then over simplified and say oh

5630.639 --> 5636.2390000000005
water light

5632.639 --> 5638.719
let's juggle let's oversimplify

5636.239 --> 5640.638999999999
put some magical thinking to it

5638.719 --> 5641.44
rearrange the puzzle pieces and then it

5640.639 --> 5644.56
works out

5641.44 --> 5648.08
no it doesn't it's not the same thing

5644.56 --> 5648.080000000001
not by a long shot

5653.6 --> 5659.679
so stars aren't in the firmament if you

5655.679 --> 5662.719
don't even know what the firmament is

5659.679 --> 5663.52
you you might have actually been able to

5662.719 --> 5666.719
deduce that

5663.52 --> 5669.52
that yeah the word is mentioned there's

5666.719 --> 5671.12
all kinds of suggestible elements to it

5669.52 --> 5674.96
and the word origin

5671.12 --> 5679.28
right it doesn't actually say what it is

5674.96 --> 5687.84
though it's so so very cute

5679.28 --> 5687.84
so very very cute

5690.719 --> 5694.32
no no

5694.48 --> 5699.919999999999
they defeated elfinor no radio waves

5698.08 --> 5701.119
definitely do not travel faster than

5699.92 --> 5703.4400000000005
light

5701.119 --> 5705.199
if light even travels and is not simply

5703.44 --> 5708.239
instantaneous

5705.199 --> 5710.32
although i think it isn't but no

5708.239 --> 5715.839999999999
radio waves definitely do not travel

5710.32 --> 5715.84
faster than light

5729.76 --> 5733.679
yeah it's all sound so plausible but

5731.679 --> 5737.1990000000005
you're all now squirting

5733.679 --> 5741.4400000000005
you're all squirting over an idea

5737.199 --> 5745.04
that is absolutely not the case

5741.44 --> 5748.0
guaranteed the phenomenon phenomena

5745.04 --> 5748.56
do not add up the elements are not there

5748.0 --> 5751.6
if you

5748.56 --> 5753.52
want to force it to be there anyway then

5751.6 --> 5754.400000000001
you're literally applying magical

5753.52 --> 5757.4400000000005
thinking

5754.4 --> 5761.28
a massive reification

5757.44 --> 5763.599999999999
massively literally entering delusional

5761.28 --> 5767.04
fantasy territory

5763.6 --> 5770.08
you understand star in a jar

5767.04 --> 5773.36
it's really cute it's not the celestial

5770.08 --> 5774.96
lights it isn't doesn't matter all the

5773.36 --> 5775.759999999999
elements you like to place together oh

5774.96 --> 5778.8
but the

5775.76 --> 5782.4800000000005
waters above and the firmament and

5778.8 --> 5783.76
no it's not that it's already probably

5782.48 --> 5786.879999999999
not that

5783.76 --> 5789.76
a star in a jar when you approach it it

5786.88 --> 5791.36
comes closer the angular size of the

5789.76 --> 5794.159000000001
star in a jar becomes

5791.36 --> 5795.839999999999
bigger to you guess what happens when

5794.159 --> 5796.5599999999995
you go in that direction towards the

5795.84 --> 5799.4400000000005
star

5796.56 --> 5800.2390000000005
oh it's not visible anymore oh it bends

5799.44 --> 5803.44
away

5800.239 --> 5806.879999999999
oh yeah it's not the same not

5803.44 --> 5813.839999999999
by a long shot

5806.88 --> 5813.84
it's not the same

5816.239 --> 5823.919999999999
star in a jar local phenomenon

5819.92 --> 5827.84
celestial lights non-local phenomenon

5823.92 --> 5827.84
that simple

5832.34 --> 5835.859
[Music]

5841.76 --> 5844.939
[Music]

5846.84 --> 5849.84
allegedly

5850.96 --> 5855.84
well okay allegedly

5856.88 --> 5860.2390000000005
i don't think so though radio waves take

5859.04 --> 5869.84
a lot longer

5860.239 --> 5869.839999999999
than laser light for example

5874.56 --> 5879.92
like when it comes to light like

5877.679 --> 5881.52
generating light and then receiving it

5879.92 --> 5884.4800000000005
at a distance

5881.52 --> 5885.119000000001
it's almost instantaneous well with

5884.48 --> 5888.799999999999
radio

5885.119 --> 5892.0
there is literally a consciously

5888.8 --> 5895.04
measurable time difference right

5892.0 --> 5898.239
it takes literally to a conscious person

5895.04 --> 5901.119
measurable time you can like know oh

5898.239 --> 5902.32
yeah that's later right just like an

5901.119 --> 5904.719
explosion sound

5902.32 --> 5907.199
you see the explosion and then the shock

5904.719 --> 5910.56
wave comes from the explosion

5907.199 --> 5913.44
because sound takes

5910.56 --> 5913.4400000000005
time to travel

5913.679 --> 5918.88
way more time than light ever does

5919.04 --> 5925.84
if it light even travels just yeah

5922.84 --> 5925.84
whatever

5927.05 --> 5930.319
[Music]

5958.8 --> 5963.04
so continue for the earth is not

5960.48 --> 5966.239
deferment why the [ __ ] would i ever say

5963.04 --> 5969.36
gravity to that stevo foster what you

5966.239 --> 5969.36
think i'm [ __ ]

5970.8 --> 5978.0
like you can't be serious like or

5973.92 --> 5978.0
unless you're not addressing me then

5978.84 --> 5981.84
right

5989.119 --> 5994.96
you are assuming the firmament is a

5991.84 --> 5997.84
physical object

5994.96 --> 5998.639
you have no reason to believe that as

5997.84 --> 6001.28
you don't know

5998.639 --> 6002.08
what it is you don't even have a

6001.28 --> 6006.0
specific

6002.08 --> 6009.679
nature to what it is spread out

6006.0 --> 6011.199
it's unclear it's not clearly defined in

6009.679 --> 6013.1990000000005
an unmistakable way

6011.199 --> 6015.839999999999
it's not so you don't know what the

6013.199 --> 6018.719
firmament is what we do now know however

6015.84 --> 6019.6
is that we breathe so that the realm the

6018.719 --> 6022.719
space

6019.6 --> 6024.719
in which we reside has to be contained

6022.719 --> 6028.0
and limited

6024.719 --> 6030.0
is it contained by the firmament

6028.0 --> 6031.52
we don't know because we don't know what

6030.0 --> 6033.52
the firmament really is

6031.52 --> 6035.280000000001
we do know however that there is a

6033.52 --> 6038.719
limited amount of volume

6035.28 --> 6041.599999999999
in which the gas pressure can expand

6038.719 --> 6041.6
it's that simple

6042.0 --> 6046.4
what the [ __ ] elijah freeman are you

6044.0 --> 6048.239
blabbering about

6046.4 --> 6051.839999999999
prism refraction what does that have to

6048.239 --> 6051.839999999999
do with anything

6054.639 --> 6067.36
yet so doesn't mean anything

6064.32 --> 6068.48
what does that mean prism refraction

6067.36 --> 6071.04
rainbows etc

6068.48 --> 6072.08
that does not prove a shitty thing it

6071.04 --> 6073.76
just proves that

6072.08 --> 6076.0
yeah light splits up and then we see

6073.76 --> 6080.2390000000005
colors it's really cute

6076.0 --> 6082.639
you need that physical barrier oh really

6080.239 --> 6082.638999999999
you do

6087.04 --> 6093.84
or you just need a limited amount of

6090.84 --> 6093.84
volume

6094.0 --> 6097.76
antecedent oh physical barriers and

6096.48 --> 6100.4
antecedent is it

6097.76 --> 6100.400000000001
no it's not

6101.36 --> 6104.799999999999
limited amount of space is the

6104.84 --> 6107.84
antecedent

6112.88 --> 6117.36
show me where else oh oh you mean like

6117.04 --> 6121.199
oh

6117.36 --> 6125.119
show me that's like saying okay can you

6121.199 --> 6127.759999999999
show me this physical man-made example

6125.119 --> 6129.119
of light coming from a non-local

6127.76 --> 6132.56
location

6129.119 --> 6134.719
light arriving to you from a non-source

6132.56 --> 6137.52
yeah i can't do that ah yeah it's out

6134.719 --> 6140.08
there though it's provably out there

6137.52 --> 6141.280000000001
so that's really oh citation yeah i am

6140.08 --> 6148.4
the citation

6141.28 --> 6151.5199999999995
there is no citation it's really cute

6148.4 --> 6154.799999999999
there is no

6151.52 --> 6156.56
proof or inevitability of a physical

6154.8 --> 6159.119000000001
barrier there is only

6156.56 --> 6161.360000000001
proof that there is a limited amount of

6159.119 --> 6162.08
volume and that means that there is no

6161.36 --> 6164.96
physical

6162.08 --> 6165.28
possibility for any gas to move beyond

6164.96 --> 6167.36
it

6165.28 --> 6168.5599999999995
doesn't mean that the barrier itself is

6167.36 --> 6170.799999999999
physical it just means

6168.56 --> 6174.320000000001
there is a limited amount of volume for

6170.8 --> 6177.6
the gas to move into

6174.32 --> 6180.0
you don't know what it is oh solid solid

6177.6 --> 6181.76
because there cannot be non-physicality

6180.0 --> 6184.239
doesn't exist right

6181.76 --> 6185.76
if there's like limited amount of volume

6184.239 --> 6188.08
that means that space

6185.76 --> 6189.52
the amount of volume is indeed infinite

6188.08 --> 6195.04
by that assumption

6189.52 --> 6195.040000000001
because if only physical things can be

6195.6 --> 6200.320000000001
can be containers then that means there

6198.08 --> 6203.28
is infinite space

6200.32 --> 6204.159
one way or the other what i'm suggesting

6203.28 --> 6206.96
is no maybe

6204.159 --> 6208.08
the limited amount of space itself will

6206.96 --> 6210.96
naturally

6208.08 --> 6212.5599999999995
become the barrier because effectively

6210.96 --> 6215.84
the gas will not have

6212.56 --> 6216.56
space to move into and then will be

6215.84 --> 6219.76
deflected

6216.56 --> 6221.52
it's not a straw man it's not a straw

6219.76 --> 6224.4800000000005
man

6221.52 --> 6226.639
don't don't start that [ __ ] with me dude

6224.48 --> 6228.638999999999
do not

6226.639 --> 6231.679
i know exactly what i'm talking about

6228.639 --> 6234.32
i've literally been discussing this

6231.679 --> 6235.04
one this is one of the subjects for five

6234.32 --> 6237.84
years

6235.04 --> 6239.679
on a daily basis don't freaking tell me

6237.84 --> 6247.28
that i'm straw manning

6239.679 --> 6249.36
simply don't understand what i'm saying

6247.28 --> 6251.679
yeah but your conclusion of light and

6249.36 --> 6256.0
rainbows is that there is a physical

6251.679 --> 6256.0
barrier that was the claim you made

6258.84 --> 6265.28
right

6261.119 --> 6269.199
and i'm drawing in the antecedent for

6265.28 --> 6270.0
gas pressure right so it's very simple

6269.199 --> 6275.04
i'm saying

6270.0 --> 6278.96
what physical barrier barrier perhaps

6275.04 --> 6281.28
maybe due to the literal lack of volume

6278.96 --> 6282.2390000000005
for matter to spread into that doesn't

6281.28 --> 6285.28
mean it's a

6282.239 --> 6287.199
physical object sitting there because

6285.28 --> 6288.08
that would suggest oh so that means that

6287.199 --> 6291.5199999999995
physical object

6288.08 --> 6295.28
is sitting inside more space is it

6291.52 --> 6295.280000000001
right no

6295.44 --> 6302.48
that's my point doesn't have to be a

6299.44 --> 6303.759999999999
physical material based object that is

6302.48 --> 6308.159
the container

6303.76 --> 6308.159000000001
simply needs a limited amount of volume

6308.55 --> 6311.7390000000005
[Music]

6313.6 --> 6320.27
yeah so i didn't

6317.23 --> 6320.2699999999995
[Music]

6325.199 --> 6330.239
how else can we see create a

6327.44 --> 6333.678999999999
rainbow-like effect

6330.239 --> 6333.678999999999
like light through a window

6334.32 --> 6339.599999999999
it's just light going through prismatic

6337.119 --> 6339.599999999999
breakup

6342.84 --> 6349.119000000001
prismatics

6345.679 --> 6351.84
right a rain droplet can be a prismatic

6349.119 --> 6353.679
influence that's what i'm saying yeah

6351.84 --> 6357.6
that's cute

6353.679 --> 6359.84
not proof of a physical barrier though

6357.6 --> 6359.84
right

6362.96 --> 6368.88
besides what physical barrier

6366.0 --> 6371.84
would even be relevant to literal

6368.88 --> 6375.679
non-local phenomenon

6371.84 --> 6378.159000000001
celestial light not literal positioned

6375.679 --> 6379.36
spots from which light emanates not

6378.159 --> 6382.239
literal position not

6379.36 --> 6383.199
outside of the container not inside of

6382.239 --> 6386.718999999999
the container

6383.199 --> 6389.199
it is literally non-local

6386.719 --> 6390.6
celestial lights are not in positions

6389.199 --> 6392.96
they're only

6390.6 --> 6395.119000000001
angular-wise apparently there in

6392.96 --> 6398.96
relation to the observer specific

6395.119 --> 6402.719
location in a very consistent fashion

6398.96 --> 6405.119
that is all they are not anywhere

6402.719 --> 6407.119
they're not behind a firmament they're

6405.119 --> 6408.96
not inside a firmament they are

6407.119 --> 6412.32
non-local things they are not

6408.96 --> 6413.119
actually in positions so nothing is

6412.32 --> 6416.0
going to be

6413.119 --> 6417.119
in between because it the celestial

6416.0 --> 6419.44
lights are not

6417.119 --> 6420.4
anywhere they are literally not in

6419.44 --> 6429.839999999999
positions

6420.4 --> 6429.839999999999
in order for things to be in between

6440.719 --> 6444.159
yeah that's right

6445.92 --> 6449.52
that's what we know about it but if

6448.4 --> 6453.5199999999995
you're going to

6449.52 --> 6456.8
now assume mechanics of light

6453.52 --> 6459.040000000001
based on things that we can make

6456.8 --> 6460.8
here on earth that produce light you're

6459.04 --> 6463.44
already going by things that

6460.8 --> 6466.2390000000005
literally are not the same thing because

6463.44 --> 6469.04
this rainbow effect coming from the sun

6466.239 --> 6470.638999999999
yeah that's really special isn't it well

6469.04 --> 6472.56
can you please try to do that with

6470.639 --> 6474.56
man-made devices

6472.56 --> 6476.8
can you demonstrate that that would be

6474.56 --> 6476.8
cute

6477.28 --> 6480.5599999999995
because i haven't haven't seen it

6481.76 --> 6487.92
so you literally do not know

6485.119 --> 6491.599999999999
like what sunlight even is in order to

6487.92 --> 6491.6
directly cause a rainbow

6492.08 --> 6496.96
with a daylight that's exactly what i

6494.32 --> 6496.96
just said

6497.6 --> 6502.88
you don't know what it is it's non-local

6501.44 --> 6505.5199999999995
light it doesn't matter

6502.88 --> 6508.159000000001
if it's inside it's still gonna be

6505.52 --> 6508.159000000001
daylight

6508.239 --> 6512.0
where do you guide this celestial light

6510.719 --> 6513.92
from the outside into

6512.0 --> 6516.639
some kind of confined box is not

6513.92 --> 6519.679
relevant to what it actually is

6516.639 --> 6519.679
non-local based

6523.76 --> 6527.6
a daylight bulb yeah that's very cute

6526.4 --> 6530.719
but that means

6527.6 --> 6535.6
you have created a light coming from

6530.719 --> 6541.84
a specific physically provable point

6535.6 --> 6541.84
mimics the wavelength that's cute

6557.119 --> 6561.44
doesn't your individual perspective dome

6559.76 --> 6563.1990000000005
of vision obscure the heavenly light

6561.44 --> 6566.5599999999995
well no it doesn't

6563.199 --> 6569.199
because if they were literal lamps

6566.56 --> 6570.080000000001
hanging in a very specific position very

6569.199 --> 6572.4
high up

6570.08 --> 6573.84
we probably wouldn't even see any of it

6572.4 --> 6576.879999999999
because it would be too far

6573.84 --> 6577.92
away for us to actually pick it up in

6576.88 --> 6580.08
for square law

6577.92 --> 6580.08
no

6581.04 --> 6583.84
so

6589.52 --> 6596.080000000001
yeah well the point is you're not making

6593.36 --> 6598.96
a point

6596.08 --> 6599.679
really really cute all that but it does

6598.96 --> 6601.92
not prove

6599.679 --> 6603.119
anything about the the origin of the

6601.92 --> 6606.2390000000005
celestial light

6603.119 --> 6608.639
where they supposedly are or anything

6606.239 --> 6610.638999999999
about a barrier or something reflecting

6608.639 --> 6612.0
it doesn't prove any of that because it

6610.639 --> 6614.8
doesn't prove

6612.0 --> 6616.8
what it is it doesn't prove what the

6614.8 --> 6625.84
celestial lights are

6616.8 --> 6625.84
as a phenomenon

6625.92 --> 6630.0
yeah i'm sure i'll find it interesting

6628.56 --> 6631.52
but it's not going to change my mind

6630.0 --> 6633.119
though because i've already been

6631.52 --> 6634.639
confronted with these type of

6633.119 --> 6638.0
discussions

6634.639 --> 6641.28
hundreds if not thousands of hundreds of

6638.0 --> 6643.52
times in the last five years or last

6641.28 --> 6644.639
four years mostly when i really started

6643.52 --> 6648.159000000001
to

6644.639 --> 6650.08
get it clear that the celestial lights

6648.159 --> 6651.199
were holographic in nature and not

6650.08 --> 6653.599
physical

6651.199 --> 6655.199
right and i've been having that debate

6653.599 --> 6657.04
that discussion with people with

6655.199 --> 6660.32
physicality assumption bias

6657.04 --> 6662.639
ever since not a single exception

6660.32 --> 6664.239
a few people that can actually say okay

6662.639 --> 6667.04
i think i get what you mean

6664.239 --> 6669.04
and then stop whining about it that's

6667.04 --> 6673.04
the best i got out of it

6669.04 --> 6676.08
right like nathan understands my concept

6673.04 --> 6678.4
he repeats it pretty well he's not gonna

6676.08 --> 6681.04
do anything with it

6678.4 --> 6682.4
other than basically use it as

6681.04 --> 6684.48
disclaimer

6682.4 --> 6687.04
for physical nature like with distance

6684.48 --> 6689.839999999999
to the sun and all

6687.04 --> 6691.36
have faith get don't tell me to have

6689.84 --> 6695.84
faith

6691.36 --> 6695.839999999999
the [ __ ]

6698.239 --> 6708.4
to see your observation it's cute

6702.32 --> 6710.08
i've seen a lot of observations

6708.4 --> 6723.119
oh how am i doing in general yeah i'm

6710.08 --> 6725.119
doing fine

6723.119 --> 6727.44
now we don't have a local sun and a

6725.119 --> 6730.32
local moon

6727.44 --> 6732.08
no none of it is local all the celestial

6730.32 --> 6734.5599999999995
lights are non-local they're all

looking

6849.28 --> 6857.759999999999
in the direction from which
