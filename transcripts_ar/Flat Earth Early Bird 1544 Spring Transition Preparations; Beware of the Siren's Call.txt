112.079 --> 116.96
today is yeah different

118.74 --> 123.119
although I don't know man yesterday it

121.32 --> 125.75899999999999
cleared up like at the end of the show

123.119 --> 127.619
was suddenly all blue sky so

125.759 --> 130.56
maybe that'll happen again but right now

127.619 --> 135.8
it seems kind of like

130.56 --> 135.8
cloudy even slightly Misty

135.959 --> 139.70000000000002
slightly not really

140.16 --> 147.12
there's a blue spots in between the

143.28 --> 150.08
clouds though but nothing

147.12 --> 150.08
significant

151.379 --> 155.51999999999998
it's much less wind it's something that

153.48 --> 159.23899999999998
I'm really noticing

155.52 --> 160.98000000000002
also feels just not as nice and warm as

159.239 --> 164.09900000000002
it did yesterday even when it was

160.98 --> 165.54
clouded so I don't know

164.099 --> 169.01899999999998
it's a little cooler I think it's

165.54 --> 171.78
probably around 12 degrees or something

169.019 --> 175.739
anyway I'll check

171.78 --> 177.78
hello tiger bear first in chat Oz good

175.739 --> 184.26
to see you

177.78 --> 184.26
it is Sunday the 19th of March 2023

189.239 --> 195.8
close yeah

191.22 --> 195.8
wow On Target 12 degrees

199.86 --> 205.62
it's hilarious all this forecast like

202.319 --> 208.07999999999998
look at all this rain it hasn't rained

205.62 --> 210.12
rain so I don't know

208.08 --> 212.28
like at home so I don't know what this

210.12 --> 214.22
forecast is talking about concerning

212.28 --> 217.8
that

214.22 --> 220.64
but uh yeah we'll see maybe it will rain

217.8 --> 220.64000000000001
I don't know

223.2 --> 228.379
anyway

224.58 --> 228.37900000000002
yeah how are you guys doing this Sunday

230.7 --> 234.44
I am doing really good actually

237.06 --> 240.62
did not go to bed late

244.799 --> 250.76000000000002
and yeah that was

246.36 --> 253.26000000000002
it was just up earlier and very active

250.76 --> 256.68
watched a whole bunch of things I even

253.26 --> 258.78
watched the Dr Becky video

256.68 --> 261.62
Brian recommended

258.78 --> 261.61999999999995
on Skype

265.02 --> 268.03999999999996
was hilarious

269.88 --> 272.9
very typical

274.38 --> 280.199
four to the Grand Prix oh so racing

277.32 --> 282.68
season starting again

280.199 --> 282.68
okay

289.919 --> 294.5
all right but anyway yeah I got a title

292.02 --> 294.5
for the show

294.72 --> 298.68
kind of

295.919 --> 300.71999999999997
riding on what I was already kind of

298.68 --> 303.06
talking about yesterday

300.72 --> 305.1
on that spring transition I'm really

303.06 --> 307.5
fascinated by it and

305.1 --> 309.41900000000004
it has always had a great influence on

307.5 --> 311.82
me so why not

309.419 --> 314.4
actually highlighted in

311.82 --> 317.12
analyze it

314.4 --> 317.12
s faces

317.759 --> 322.74
right

319.08 --> 327.0
so when spring comes and it's like

322.74 --> 329.039
weights of winter drop off you in a way

327.0 --> 331.08
for some people

329.039 --> 333.12
most will hear the call right there's

331.08 --> 337.25899999999996
it's like this call

333.12 --> 339.6
from nature and it's all about seduction

337.259 --> 340.91900000000004
in all kinds of ways I mean sexual

339.6 --> 343.759
seduction

340.919 --> 343.75899999999996
uh

345.18 --> 349.979
just

346.5 --> 352.02
things like drugs all these things they

349.979 --> 354.24
will also start calling for a whole

352.02 --> 357.84
bunch of people

354.24 --> 361.44
so beware of the sirens call

357.84 --> 363.29999999999995
like when you crawl out of a

361.44 --> 365.21999999999997
slightly lower functioning position

363.3 --> 367.5
mentally

365.22 --> 369.47900000000004
because it's been winter and there's

367.5 --> 371.46
just not a lot of energy available then

369.479 --> 373.74
you have to be aware that when you

371.46 --> 375.71999999999997
retain these fields you're going to then

373.74 --> 380.06
immediate it will be immediately

375.72 --> 380.06
accomplished by seductions again

381.66 --> 385.8
right

383.46 --> 387.18
it's like when you stay inside all the

385.8 --> 388.8
time

387.18 --> 390.419
yeah you have a certain pattern you have

388.8 --> 393.6
a way of dealing with it if you then go

390.419 --> 397.68
outside again then you're gonna face

393.6 --> 400.259
other things that will lead you to

397.68 --> 403.199
a lot of people typically fall back into

400.259 --> 406.699
Old behaviors also right that's the

403.199 --> 406.699
sirens call You're Gonna Be Where

409.86 --> 416.88
best time spent during spring is to

413.6 --> 417.90000000000003
truly just like work on yourself on your

416.88 --> 418.919
condition

417.9 --> 421.31899999999996
um

418.919 --> 422.88
on your health

421.319 --> 427.319
and

422.88 --> 429.419
and yeah work constructive like

427.319 --> 431.94
it's not even like oh going back to work

429.419 --> 433.08
it's like if you most people have been

431.94 --> 437.46
working

433.08 --> 440.039
then like try to use the pulse of it uh

437.46 --> 442.31899999999996
not just get distracted and have more

440.039 --> 444.36
enjoyment for yourself but to like try

442.319 --> 448.40000000000003
to improve

444.36 --> 448.40000000000003
for example your working conditions

449.099 --> 455.15999999999997
that extra energy might also give you an

452.52 --> 457.5
extra piece of insight I mean Deltas can

455.16 --> 460.139
use the sirens call if they don't get

457.5 --> 462.0
seduced and distracted like Gammas

460.139 --> 465.06
typically do

462.0 --> 467.88
they can use the sirens call to be

465.06 --> 470.639
even sharper

467.88 --> 472.8
and well what better to spend that extra

470.639 --> 475.139
sharp edge

472.8 --> 477.96000000000004
with your constructivity then on

475.139 --> 480.419
improving the the conditions in which

477.96 --> 483.56
you are constructed like your work floor

480.419 --> 483.56
for example right

486.06 --> 490.44
so it's not just oh God it's like a

488.46 --> 493.19899999999996
banshee going around the sirens call no

490.44 --> 495.479
no no no there is a lot of energy

493.199 --> 498.24
it's just that

495.479 --> 500.099
you have to be aware of mania

498.24 --> 502.86
of feeling like oh I've been so

500.099 --> 505.139
suppressed oh I'm God again and right

502.86 --> 509.099
unleashing

505.139 --> 512.0600000000001
too much blowing all your gunpowder or

509.099 --> 512.06
you know what

516.06 --> 521.8199999999999
or another you know what like you got to

519.539 --> 523.74
be careful

521.82 --> 525.3000000000001
for the unleash

523.74 --> 527.519
anyway

525.3 --> 530.399
some general advice I think it would

527.519 --> 533.72
apply to literally everybody like at any

530.399 --> 533.72
age category pretty much

534.36 --> 538.6800000000001
as soon as you have awareness

536.519 --> 542.4590000000001
because you're gonna

538.68 --> 545.3389999999999
might go through it more significantly

542.459 --> 547.3199999999999
or somebody else that's close to you

545.339 --> 550.2600000000001
might go through that

547.32 --> 553.5600000000001
it's like more sensitive to to the

550.26 --> 555.8389999999999
phases of the seasons and all that

553.56 --> 558.4799999999999
you know so it's just good to be aware

555.839 --> 561.74
of it and when that happens and prepare

558.48 --> 561.74
for it don't just

563.459 --> 568.5
be like a man that's stuck in a cave

566.279 --> 570.8389999999999
coming out for the first time just

568.5 --> 572.279
completely blinded stumbling into some

570.839 --> 575.5400000000001
hole breaking their leg or something

572.279 --> 575.54
like don't be like that

575.6 --> 580.62
be prepared anticipate what you should

579.54 --> 583.56
know

580.62 --> 586.44
will happen because

583.56 --> 590.0999999999999
it's a cyclical thing it comes with the

586.44 --> 592.32
season anticipate anticipate what

590.1 --> 594.66
happened the last time

592.32 --> 596.279
when something went wrong

594.66 --> 599.279
because of it

596.279 --> 600.32
awareness helps it helps a lot

599.279 --> 602.7
anyway

600.32 --> 605.1500000000001
so what I do here on the Flat Earth

602.7 --> 606.6
early bird show

605.15 --> 610.279
[Music]

606.6 --> 610.279
hello Richard G good to see you

613.22 --> 619.019
pull that last bit of body fat love

616.08 --> 621.4200000000001
ready for a beef season

619.019 --> 624.779
right

621.42 --> 626.459
yeah well that that could be a thing

624.779 --> 629.04
I mean I don't really have a lot of body

626.459 --> 632.42
fat but for me it's like

629.04 --> 632.42
regrowing some muscle

632.82 --> 637.1400000000001
and my muscles always growing very

635.16 --> 639.7199999999999
quickly anyway like it's not really

637.14 --> 640.92
changed with age

639.72 --> 644.88
but

640.92 --> 647.399
the stresses on my body do like get more

644.88 --> 651.36
over time that is something that I have

647.399 --> 654.24
noticed but it's very doable still

651.36 --> 657.12
as long as I'm very careful right now

654.24 --> 659.1
especially with this kind of thing

657.12 --> 661.14
it's like oh I'm opening up again oh I'm

659.1 --> 663.66
seeing more things and it's like ah yeah

661.14 --> 666.0
I'm like I'm 20 again like oh no no no

663.66 --> 669.8389999999999
Arwin don't do that

666.0 --> 672.12
cause you'll be I can do everything

669.839 --> 674.5790000000001
again and then just like just like doing

672.12 --> 677.519
this overly enthusiastic and then like

674.579 --> 680.0999999999999
ah Tara muscle or something right

677.519 --> 682.86
I gotta be careful not to think

680.1 --> 684.839
like just because

682.86 --> 687.3000000000001
energy is coming back spring is coming

684.839 --> 689.9590000000001
back that I'm now suddenly younger than

687.3 --> 689.959
I really am

690.66 --> 695.66
like don't lose oversight because of the

696.36 --> 702.72
the spring of water that you finally

699.12 --> 705.32
find in the desert after a long dwelling

702.72 --> 705.32
you know

707.04 --> 710.8389999999999
be aware anyway ah

711.3 --> 717.3199999999999
trusts it says

714.42 --> 717.3199999999999
do I trust

717.66 --> 723.0
well

719.64 --> 725.279
it's patterns and there's some real it's

723.0 --> 727.92
well thought out patterns

725.279 --> 731.399
in Revelation so

727.92 --> 733.92
there is something to it although

731.399 --> 735.72
yeah what is literal and what isn't and

733.92 --> 739.3199999999999
also

735.72 --> 742.6800000000001
if it is a prediction of the future then

739.32 --> 746.7600000000001
there is a Cassandra effect in place

742.68 --> 748.68
it's like you can't really the real

746.76 --> 753.079
prophecies are

748.68 --> 753.079
like elaborate detail probably is

754.44 --> 758.12
it's really tricky

759.42 --> 761.899
right

762.72 --> 767.7
so

765.26 --> 770.639
[Music]

767.7 --> 773.82
but I mean there's a plenty of parallels

770.639 --> 777.24
in Revelations with things that going on

773.82 --> 779.279
and I've even argued like yeah I mean

777.24 --> 781.62
does it likelihood they're literally

779.279 --> 784.5
using

781.62 --> 787.279
the Bible has an inspiration on how to

784.5 --> 787.279
be the devil

787.5 --> 794.76
so that they literally use it on purpose

792.24 --> 796.6800000000001
very satanic of course but

794.76 --> 799.16
yeah there's multiple things to say

796.68 --> 799.16
about it

799.62 --> 805.139
is that producing the future by

801.24 --> 807.9300000000001
predicting it no it's knowing the future

805.139 --> 809.5790000000001
but not being able to alter it

807.93 --> 812.0999999999999
[Music]

809.579 --> 813.42
and it's not lit what I just mentioned I

812.1 --> 815.4590000000001
mentioned the Cassandra effect not

813.42 --> 817.1999999999999
because it what I mentioned was the

815.459 --> 822.1999999999999
Cassandra effect it's

817.2 --> 824.88
in that realm of bizarre

822.2 --> 827.519
time-based interactions

824.88 --> 829.5
if you're predicting the future if not

827.519 --> 833.36
predicting because that's an estimation

829.5 --> 833.36
but if you're seeing the future

833.76 --> 840.24
then that in a way changes everything

838.92 --> 842.279
it's

840.24 --> 844.26
if it's real right if it's just a

842.279 --> 845.519
prediction predictions are very

844.26 --> 848.16
different

845.519 --> 851.04
from actually having witnessed like

848.16 --> 854.519
Visions or whatever of the future

851.04 --> 856.74
there will be like interpersonal issues

854.519 --> 860.399
because of it

856.74 --> 862.5600000000001
one of them is the Cassandra effect

860.399 --> 864.48
and these interpersonal issues really

862.56 --> 865.56
will feel when I can attest to that

864.48 --> 868.74
personally

865.56 --> 871.68
not not too much but a little

868.74 --> 875.76
that it really does feel like the

871.68 --> 877.8599999999999
universe or God just makes you unable

875.76 --> 880.92
to change it it's like

877.86 --> 882.9590000000001
you want it but it all just becomes

880.92 --> 886.68
contained within a bubble inward it's

882.959 --> 888.54
like you can't really change it and then

886.68 --> 890.3389999999999
when you think you might be able to

888.54 --> 891.959
change it then you find out that it's

890.339 --> 893.1600000000001
certainly too late

891.959 --> 896.2399999999999
it's

893.16 --> 896.24
really bizarre

899.639 --> 905.279
and yeah a prophecy having literally

902.76 --> 908.579
communicated

905.279 --> 912.899
with a knowing of the future

908.579 --> 915.7399999999999
it's really bizarre it's like that can't

912.899 --> 915.74
just happen

916.32 --> 921.0600000000001
it's like even the thing is

919.019 --> 922.74
if you would really want to know about

921.06 --> 926.459
how something's going to roll out then

922.74 --> 928.86
to simulate it in your mind and actually

926.459 --> 931.0189999999999
basically make an elaborate prediction

928.86 --> 935.399
model

931.019 --> 937.5600000000001
is more durable than for somehow through

935.399 --> 940.8
some occult or

937.56 --> 943.9799999999999
yeah interdimensional drug or Seance or

940.8 --> 947.0999999999999
whatever way actually attaining

943.98 --> 948.839
knowledge of the future and then trying

947.1 --> 952.019
to communicate that

948.839 --> 954.12
it's like making a model is a lot more

952.019 --> 956.639
durable

954.12 --> 960.079
than to actually find out and then

956.639 --> 960.0790000000001
trying to communicate that

961.8 --> 965.06
it's really bizarre

967.98 --> 974.519
like I actually tried to do that in ways

972.0 --> 976.44
when I was really like very thick in the

974.519 --> 978.6
visions and [ __ ] and started to notice

976.44 --> 982.1990000000001
there was time

978.6 --> 984.48
things and even communicating it back

982.199 --> 987.3
and when I communicated back something

984.48 --> 990.44
that I saw in the future

987.3 --> 990.4399999999999
it like was

991.199 --> 998.0999999999999
it's like a changed reality itself

995.339 --> 999.6600000000001
it was really but not in the way that I

998.1 --> 1002.6800000000001
wanted

999.66 --> 1002.68
and it's like

1007.1 --> 1011.72
and now

1008.899 --> 1015.94
all these things that I've seen I can

1011.72 --> 1015.94
communicate them now because it's like

1016.279 --> 1021.4399999999999
now I can just tell you sort of like

1019.16 --> 1024.98
what I've seen

1021.44 --> 1027.88
but back then I couldn't it was

1024.98 --> 1027.88
impossible

1030.319 --> 1036.74
when that was actually the real reason

1033.02 --> 1039.5
that I even dug in there it's because I

1036.74 --> 1043.1
want I insisted like no

1039.5 --> 1046.78
if this exists then I have to use it to

1043.1 --> 1046.78
change things it's like otherwise

1047.179 --> 1052.4
why would it even be possible I

1049.82 --> 1055.58
basically got weirdly stuck in some sort

1052.4 --> 1055.5800000000002
of paradoxical

1056.72 --> 1060.88
obsession

1058.16 --> 1060.88
like that

1061.28 --> 1064.0
for a while

1073.22 --> 1077.799
hello George Sanford Tara 306

1078.86 --> 1083.6499999999999
right

1080.56 --> 1083.6499999999999
[Music]

1084.559 --> 1089.96
anyway yeah it started off from hitting

1087.26 --> 1091.7
the ground running

1089.96 --> 1093.74
with the esoteric stuff there

1091.7 --> 1096.6200000000001
immediately diving into

1093.74 --> 1100.039
actual time-based

1096.62 --> 1101.5
conceptions yeah or you could say

1100.039 --> 1104.48
cosmology

1101.5 --> 1105.98
actual interdimensional cosmology and

1104.48 --> 1109.84
functions of the spirit in spirit

1105.98 --> 1109.84
mechanics and not the [ __ ]

1110.02 --> 1115.82
busy astrophysics

1112.7 --> 1118.82
cosmology like the video I watched with

1115.82 --> 1122.9189999999999
Dr Becky God

1118.82 --> 1122.9189999999999
that thing was absolutely ridiculous

1124.88 --> 1130.7800000000002
take a look and

1127.82 --> 1130.78
see what I mean

1132.799 --> 1137.299
anyway

1134.24 --> 1139.039
what is the news about

1137.299 --> 1143.44
okay

1139.039 --> 1143.44
all right anyway yeah yesterday's show

1144.799 --> 1152.98
was pretty cool and yeah flat side also

1148.46 --> 1152.98
had a really intense long stream

1153.44 --> 1158.72
that was interesting some Ballers got on

1156.799 --> 1160.7
there it was getting very tedious

1158.72 --> 1163.58
eventually

1160.7 --> 1166.52
and I got I I went a bit ballistic there

1163.58 --> 1169.28
in the chat I just got so freaking sick

1166.52 --> 1172.7
of that guy just not understanding it I

1169.28 --> 1175.4189999999999
was like ready to just

1172.7 --> 1175.419
strangle

1177.32 --> 1182.2
but it was flat soil was really

1182.36 --> 1188.24
really stable about it

1185.539 --> 1190.46
and funny though because he did like you

1188.24 --> 1193.7
they get to see his face on camera and

1190.46 --> 1196.46
it's like very expressive of like oh

1193.7 --> 1198.7
this guy is [ __ ] stupid just keep

1196.46 --> 1198.7
going

1200.84 --> 1205.52
it was it was a good stream I mean flat

1203.36 --> 1207.8799999999999
side is doing a great job I think with

1205.52 --> 1207.8799999999999
this channel

1208.1 --> 1211.2199999999998
when he gets Ballers on he's pretty good

1210.02 --> 1213.559
at it

1211.22 --> 1216.88
better than I I'm I just don't have the

1213.559 --> 1216.8799999999999
patience for that [ __ ] man

1217.34 --> 1222.74
although I'm not as bad as QE QE is the

1220.94 --> 1225.38
worst I mean

1222.74 --> 1227.78
but that's kind of obvious

1225.38 --> 1230.179
but it's still I don't I lose my

1227.78 --> 1231.2
patience eventually and I do go kind of

1230.179 --> 1233.299
dark

1231.2 --> 1236.6000000000001
like it just really

1233.299 --> 1238.76
gets on my nerve eventually and I think

1236.6 --> 1240.32
Nathan also has that but

1238.76 --> 1242.66
with him

1240.32 --> 1245.9189999999999
it does take a long time he's like

1242.66 --> 1250.4
specifically trained himself to

1245.919 --> 1252.7990000000002
have a longer patience span

1250.4 --> 1255.679
with Ballers which is very wise because

1252.799 --> 1258.08
yeah you want to keep getting them in

1255.679 --> 1260.0590000000002
the show to demonstrate what they're

1258.08 --> 1262.82
like

1260.059 --> 1265.039
even though QE is obviously obstructing

1262.82 --> 1267.08
that because he's out of control

1265.039 --> 1268.94
and I would recommend QE actually get

1267.08 --> 1271.6399999999999
some ashwagandha

1268.94 --> 1273.38
I think that specifically will help him

1271.64 --> 1275.0800000000002
out

1273.38 --> 1277.8200000000002
with his

1275.08 --> 1281.12
uncontrollable mood

1277.82 --> 1284.059
it is great it works excellent

1281.12 --> 1286.8799999999999
and very acutely and it doesn't have

1284.059 --> 1289.28
yeah it's

1286.88 --> 1291.7990000000002
doesn't have anything like some kind of

1289.28 --> 1294.32
a weird transformative impact that

1291.799 --> 1296.9
regular Pharmaceuticals have that try to

1294.32 --> 1298.6399999999999
change your moods it's great so I

1296.9 --> 1301.1000000000001
definitely recommend kiwi try out

1298.64 --> 1302.3600000000001
ashwagandha

1301.1 --> 1304.9399999999998
like

1302.36 --> 1306.6789999999999
just take one on an empty stomach right

1304.94 --> 1309.559
you're always like oh my God he needs

1306.679 --> 1313.52
breakfast Yeah well yeah that you have

1309.559 --> 1316.52
to do something but taking just one pill

1313.52 --> 1318.799
what on capsule

1316.52 --> 1320.36
with a bit of water that takes no effort

1318.799 --> 1322.6399999999999
at all you can literally do that the

1320.36 --> 1325.28
second you can you come out of bed

1322.64 --> 1328.26
and I really recommend you do that John

1325.28 --> 1331.22
I really do it's a serious advice

1328.26 --> 1333.5
[Music]

1331.22 --> 1337.28
it's been great for me I think that

1333.5 --> 1342.1
people that follow my show can attest

1337.28 --> 1344.6589999999999
to that my overall mood has very much

1342.1 --> 1347.4189999999999
smoothing out

1344.659 --> 1350.98
I mean I still have hard moments but

1347.419 --> 1350.98
less uncontrolled

1353.539 --> 1356.539
anyway

1357.26 --> 1359.74
foreign

1363.1 --> 1368.48
yeah no I've been taking I

1365.78 --> 1372.32
I think I've talked about it

1368.48 --> 1374.3600000000001
even at Infowars they now sell ashwagand

1372.32 --> 1376.34
now all of a sudden

1374.36 --> 1378.9799999999998
I started it

1376.34 --> 1381.26
uh

1378.98 --> 1383.179
somewhere before my birthday

1381.26 --> 1387.26
and it's been great

1383.179 --> 1388.94
I got it from my stepmother

1387.26 --> 1391.039
during Christmas

1388.94 --> 1392.659
or rather I picked it up because she

1391.039 --> 1396.26
just had that and I was like what is

1392.659 --> 1399.5590000000002
that huh and then my intuition

1396.26 --> 1401.179
it's just like no just try it out

1399.559 --> 1405.7
it's time

1401.179 --> 1405.7
okay but yeah it's great

1406.7 --> 1411.6200000000001
it doesn't always work like supremely

1410.539 --> 1414.559
but

1411.62 --> 1416.539
sometimes it just makes such a great

1414.559 --> 1419.36
impact when I take it

1416.539 --> 1423.26
ashwagandha

1419.36 --> 1426.4399999999998
right so royal green has it it's

1423.26 --> 1429.14
that that I mean royal green by now is a

1426.44 --> 1433.1200000000001
pretty standard brand

1429.14 --> 1433.1200000000001
so it's it's bound to be everywhere

1434.659 --> 1438.38
I mean

1435.98 --> 1439.58
I've been thinking about it ashwagandha

1438.38 --> 1441.5590000000002
yeah

1439.58 --> 1445.3999999999999
even though I've not taken it for a very

1441.559 --> 1446.78
long time but my healers read out were

1445.4 --> 1449.72
good

1446.78 --> 1451.82
because I asked right it's like okay ask

1449.72 --> 1453.919
the spirits act ask the spirit of Christ

1451.82 --> 1457.52
as your guides

1453.919 --> 1460.2800000000002
like does this have long-term build up

1457.52 --> 1462.08
of some potential negative influence and

1460.28 --> 1463.7
they were like no it doesn't seem to

1462.08 --> 1465.9399999999998
have that at all

1463.7 --> 1468.919
okay

1465.94 --> 1471.2
straightforward like that right

1468.919 --> 1473.72
and

1471.2 --> 1476.9
I think that this could be like

1473.72 --> 1479.5
an actual effective

1476.9 --> 1479.5
like

1479.6 --> 1486.62
how some people use antidepressants

1483.74 --> 1487.78
I think that this would be like a really

1486.62 --> 1489.1999999999998
great natural

1487.78 --> 1491.96
[Music]

1489.2 --> 1495.74
alternative

1491.96 --> 1497.299
because it it it's it hits right where

1495.74 --> 1501.28
you need it

1497.299 --> 1503.4189999999999
you don't have any other like weird

1501.28 --> 1505.1
transformative feelings in your spirit

1503.419 --> 1509.7990000000002
or it doesn't distort anything it

1505.1 --> 1509.799
doesn't take anything away it just fixes

1509.96 --> 1514.7
slight instability

1512.419 --> 1519.38
in Peak energy it's great

1514.7 --> 1522.5800000000002
[Music]

1519.38 --> 1522.5800000000002
can you show that again

1522.62 --> 1526.8799999999999
I mean it's I can show you what's inside

1525.08 --> 1529.039
it's it's just kind of powder-ish

1526.88 --> 1531.919
there's all kinds of forms you can get

1529.039 --> 1534.08
this in I mean it's just

1531.919 --> 1536.24
ground up root

1534.08 --> 1537.74
the ashwagandha plant

1536.24 --> 1539.84
I think

1537.74 --> 1542.84
I think it's Darude

1539.84 --> 1544.8799999999999
right I mean I don't know maybe this

1542.84 --> 1548.9189999999999
plant

1544.88 --> 1552.0200000000002
could even like grow regularly in in

1548.919 --> 1554.6200000000001
moderate weather or in moderate climate

1552.02 --> 1554.62
I don't know

1559.46 --> 1564.64
not sure

1561.86 --> 1564.6399999999999
it's leaves

1564.86 --> 1570.559
I think it's both

1567.679 --> 1572.48
root and the leaves is on on the picture

1570.559 --> 1575.62
anyway

1572.48 --> 1575.6200000000001
right here too

1576.86 --> 1582.58
it's a root

1578.24 --> 1582.58
and the leaves on the other side

1588.29 --> 1591.329
[Music]

1598.64 --> 1602.26
so yeah

1603.5 --> 1609.86
it's been great for me

1606.62 --> 1613.9599999999998
there's no signs of anything dramatic

1609.86 --> 1613.9599999999998
that might roll out of it using it

1622.64 --> 1627.0200000000002
who knows what else it's actually good

1624.919 --> 1629.6000000000001
for even though I I because I'm not

1627.02 --> 1631.1
entirely sure like how to size it up

1629.6 --> 1633.86
because there's all kinds of things I

1631.1 --> 1636.4399999999998
did right changes I stopped drinking tea

1633.86 --> 1638.6589999999999
I stopped drinking beer

1636.44 --> 1641.8400000000001
right around the same time

1638.659 --> 1643.7
so I don't actually know like I haven't

1641.84 --> 1647.12
tested that without it

1643.7 --> 1650.48
but it might be that it's even helpful

1647.12 --> 1653.4799999999998
to basically quit drinking or drugs

1650.48 --> 1655.96
I'm not sure because that's not part of

1653.48 --> 1655.96
my test

1656.179 --> 1662.179
I haven't controlled that situation in

1659.659 --> 1664.7600000000002
order to establish that it just it might

1662.179 --> 1667.159
be helping I would only really find out

1664.76 --> 1669.26
one size quick

1667.159 --> 1671.24
but I I really like I go to the grocery

1669.26 --> 1673.22
store it's like oh there's the beer it's

1671.24 --> 1676.46
like oh yeah good old friend

1673.22 --> 1678.74
but I don't have like oh like I could I

1676.46 --> 1682.039
take one I had nothing

1678.74 --> 1684.02
it's nothing just like no it's a good

1682.039 --> 1685.1589999999999
old friend of beer and I might take one

1684.02 --> 1687.2
it's

1685.159 --> 1689.1200000000001
like some kind of Celebration moment or

1687.2 --> 1691.279
to snap out of a really terrible

1689.12 --> 1693.62
situation for a bit

1691.279 --> 1696.679
but it's it's it stopped

1693.62 --> 1699.2199999999998
there's no more addiction like hunger

1696.679 --> 1699.22
for it

1704.0 --> 1711.5
and I could argue that it's even helped

1707.059 --> 1713.8999999999999
me to basically smoke less as well

1711.5 --> 1715.64
because effectively I have M smoking

1713.9 --> 1717.14
less now whether that is because I

1715.64 --> 1719.9
stopped drinking or whether that's

1717.14 --> 1723.159
because of the ashwagandha I'm not sure

1719.9 --> 1723.159
it might be both

1723.799 --> 1727.54
but overall I'm saying I'm very happy

1726.679 --> 1729.5
with this supplement

1727.54 --> 1731.8999999999999
[Music]

1729.5 --> 1733.88
and it's at the infowar store too now so

1731.9 --> 1735.2
that's like a sign on the wall to me

1733.88 --> 1737.779
it's like oh

1735.2 --> 1740.919
Alex just discovered this apparently

1737.779 --> 1740.919
it's really worth it

1745.159 --> 1751.0
all right

1746.9 --> 1751.0
I mean I can't say I disagree

1761.24 --> 1764.779
looks pretty established this is sleep

1763.64 --> 1767.179
aid

1764.779 --> 1769.84
ashwagandha

1767.179 --> 1769.8400000000001
huh

1772.399 --> 1777.6999999999998
hello dank by the way good to see you

1774.26 --> 1777.7
and Thor Casey

1787.399 --> 1791.84
it's it's kind of funny to her Casey

1789.5 --> 1794.539
because if it's meant as a sleep aid

1791.84 --> 1795.74
well I take it in the morning

1794.539 --> 1799.12
foreign

1795.74 --> 1799.1200000000001
I don't take it at night

1802.399 --> 1807.6789999999999
I ain't going to never own Robert good

1805.64 --> 1808.8200000000002
good to see you how's how's it going I'm

1807.679 --> 1811.539
doing great

1808.82 --> 1811.539
I'm fine

1813.559 --> 1817.8799999999999
hope you guys are doing fine too

1815.899 --> 1818.899
I had I mean the start of the show was

1817.88 --> 1822.64
pretty good

1818.899 --> 1822.6399999999999
I mean the title and everything

1822.919 --> 1827.1000000000001
I got it out quick and now I'm just like

1825.34 --> 1830.3
talking about whatever

1827.1 --> 1830.3
[Music]

1837.74 --> 1841.36
overall sleep and Sleep Quality in some

1839.96 --> 1845.48
people

1841.36 --> 1849.62
well I've been sleeping great but I mean

1845.48 --> 1853.22
I never had real sleep trouble at all so

1849.62 --> 1856.8799999999999
it's not what I'm taking it for

1853.22 --> 1859.159
but I mean yeah my sleep is great

1856.88 --> 1861.38
so it might even be

1859.159 --> 1862.5200000000002
pushing that up to a slightly higher

1861.38 --> 1865.1000000000001
level

1862.52 --> 1867.44
could be

1865.1 --> 1870.32
but I've like I never really had trouble

1867.44 --> 1873.559
sleeping unless I'm like

1870.32 --> 1875.96
in some kind of a fear if I'm like

1873.559 --> 1877.52
got anxiety go through me that's the

1875.96 --> 1880.64
only moments that I have trouble

1877.52 --> 1882.679
sleeping but I mean I have learned to

1880.64 --> 1884.179
deal with that very acutely and

1882.679 --> 1887.24
consciously

1884.179 --> 1890.2
like I can't force my body to just like

1887.24 --> 1890.2
know

1890.299 --> 1894.9189999999999
it's like I take authority like an

1892.64 --> 1898.46
outsider and just say like no you're

1894.919 --> 1901.76
going to do this I command you to

1898.46 --> 1903.679
and then basically force my subconscious

1901.76 --> 1906.52
or whatever to to just let go whatever

1903.679 --> 1906.52
is causing it

1909.74 --> 1916.039
that helps a lot

1913.22 --> 1918.26
although yeah it doesn't always it works

1916.039 --> 1920.12
if you're really surrounded by silence

1918.26 --> 1921.26
and a little bit of dark and it's just

1920.12 --> 1923.2399999999998
calm

1921.26 --> 1924.62
and warmth and all that it works when

1923.24 --> 1926.659
I'm trying to sleep it doesn't always

1924.62 --> 1928.1589999999999
work when you're like

1926.659 --> 1930.5
active in day

1928.159 --> 1933.74
it's a different different type of

1930.5 --> 1936.26
routine required to suppress anxiety

1933.74 --> 1938.48
during the day it's actually much harder

1936.26 --> 1940.6
for me if I have an anxiety during the

1938.48 --> 1940.6
day

1941.6 --> 1948.1399999999999
because it also comes with paranoia

1945.5 --> 1950.84
that's not pleasant but I am not

1948.14 --> 1952.3990000000001
suffering under that really

1950.84 --> 1955.8799999999999
a lot

1952.399 --> 1959.4399999999998
just occasionally a bit just like waking

1955.88 --> 1959.44
up he's like yeah what's going on

1959.779 --> 1963.64
things feel wrong

1967.52 --> 1971.059
but it doesn't really hang around an

1969.86 --> 1973.8799999999999
entire day

1971.059 --> 1976.1589999999999
it used to I used to have times when I

1973.88 --> 1978.3200000000002
was just like I woke up in a bad way and

1976.159 --> 1980.96
then it would just kind of like last for

1978.32 --> 1982.8799999999999
days terrible

1980.96 --> 1986.32
but it's also because I was just not

1982.88 --> 1989.2990000000002
taking care of it it was just trying to

1986.32 --> 1991.1
avoid thinking about it and just wait

1989.299 --> 1993.22
until it goes away and then it didn't go

1991.1 --> 1993.2199999999998
away

1994.1 --> 1999.74
right now I don't avoid it

1997.399 --> 2002.4399999999998
because avoiding things is always lead

1999.74 --> 2004.6
it always leads to trouble in the end

2002.44 --> 2008.26
and you don't build skill

2004.6 --> 2011.08
so just direct confrontation oh you feel

2008.26 --> 2013.6589999999999
bad oh well guess what you are now going

2011.08 --> 2014.9189999999999
to be aware that you're feeling bad and

2013.659 --> 2017.5590000000002
about what

2014.919 --> 2020.2
and what that means to you right you're

2017.559 --> 2024.72
not gonna try to escape from that

2020.2 --> 2024.72
feeling and cause more trouble Arwin

2026.32 --> 2028.86
right

2032.98 --> 2037.919
anyway

2035.08 --> 2037.9189999999999
I'm doing great

2045.46 --> 2049.54
exactly Richard G I'm glad I'm glad

2047.86 --> 2052.24
you're with me on that it's really

2049.54 --> 2055.379
important I mean there's people that

2052.24 --> 2055.379
have just are

2055.619 --> 2059.7400000000002
chronically stunted in the ability to do

2058.899 --> 2064.5989999999997
that

2059.74 --> 2066.4599999999996
it's like I I call them Escape artists

2064.599 --> 2068.9190000000003
people that are you can't really

2066.46 --> 2070.48
confront their everything just bounces

2068.919 --> 2072.879
off

2070.48 --> 2075.46
rumpus is like like that for example an

2072.879 --> 2077.08
escape artist but I find him great find

2075.46 --> 2079.419
it fascinating

2077.08 --> 2082.119
because Escape artists when they know

2079.419 --> 2083.6189999999997
not to go dark

2082.119 --> 2085.7200000000003
they're great

2083.619 --> 2087.159
they're actually quite entertaining and

2085.72 --> 2089.6189999999997
interesting because they know everything

2087.159 --> 2090.94
about stability in the moment

2089.619 --> 2092.98
foreign

2090.94 --> 2095.26
like

2092.98 --> 2097.66
on a subconscious level they might not

2095.26 --> 2099.88
be able to teach it or even try to seed

2097.66 --> 2102.2999999999997
it with others but they have it though

2099.88 --> 2102.3
anyway

2106.599 --> 2109.6600000000003
this spring must mean yeah spring is in

2108.58 --> 2111.88
here

2109.66 --> 2115.14
and I'm doing well

2111.88 --> 2115.1400000000003
looking forward to it

2119.079 --> 2123.599
it's also reading there's a little

2121.0 --> 2123.599
evidence

2125.8 --> 2132.0600000000004
as an

2127.44 --> 2132.06
adaptogen what does that mean

2140.88 --> 2147.1600000000003
I don't know that phrasial I could

2144.0 --> 2148.54
extrapolate what it means by the

2147.16 --> 2150.5789999999997
etymology but

2148.54 --> 2153.94
I don't know that

2150.579 --> 2158.5600000000004
I've never heard that phrase before

2153.94 --> 2158.56
like that Thor Casey adaptogen

2175.0 --> 2178.38
oh man I'm hungry

2179.079 --> 2181.6800000000003
yeah

2181.839 --> 2187.7999999999997
no Illuminati comes on for me though

2184.54 --> 2187.8
couldn't afford that

2191.44 --> 2196.8
but at least I will have a pizza after

2193.54 --> 2196.8
this looking forward to that

2205.3 --> 2207.8390000000004
what

2209.94 --> 2217.359
stabilization of physiological processes

2213.9 --> 2219.64
promotional homeostasis

2217.359 --> 2223.839
uh so that's like a

2219.64 --> 2227.7599999999998
High medicine term like

2223.839 --> 2227.7599999999998
medical research terminology

2230.619 --> 2237.4
right so an adaptogen would basically be

2233.8 --> 2240.1600000000003
the counter opposite of a pathogen then

2237.4 --> 2241.96
instead of a destabilizing factor it's a

2240.16 --> 2243.3999999999996
stabilizing Factor that's pretty much it

2241.96 --> 2245.98
okay

2243.4 --> 2247.54
all right they have a word for it now

2245.98 --> 2250.38
adaptogen

2247.54 --> 2250.38
cool well

2251.26 --> 2257.5200000000004
yeah piece of their cosmology has

2254.859 --> 2257.52
expanded

2261.46 --> 2265.2400000000002
hey GG

2267.22 --> 2270.48
welcome to the Stream

2274.72 --> 2280.98
you're hard so much from debunking

2277.42 --> 2280.98
videos heard yeah yeah

2281.8 --> 2286.119
good luck with the anxiety well I don't

2284.44 --> 2287.44
really need luck

2286.119 --> 2289.599
like

2287.44 --> 2291.7000000000003
I know how to deal with it

2289.599 --> 2293.56
right don't worry about just because I'm

2291.7 --> 2296.3799999999997
describing it doesn't mean that I'm

2293.56 --> 2298.9
describing it because I'm in it yeah I

2296.38 --> 2300.04
can describe States when I'm not in

2298.9 --> 2304.2000000000003
those States

2300.04 --> 2304.2
and still remember like I can

2305.44 --> 2311.2000000000003
do that

2308.02 --> 2312.7
when I'm strong when I'm strong I'm like

2311.2 --> 2314.7999999999997
super flexible

2312.7 --> 2318.2799999999997
with my spirit and like it's like yeah

2314.8 --> 2321.46
then I can really act I can really

2318.28 --> 2325.3590000000004
remember and use my empathic range very

2321.46 --> 2327.099
carefully without getting overwhelmed by

2325.359 --> 2330.22
the spiritual metadata

2327.099 --> 2331.839
when I'm less strong then it all becomes

2330.22 --> 2333.8199999999997
like ah

2331.839 --> 2335.92
it's like a psionic storm it's like

2333.82 --> 2338.619
everything becomes too much

2335.92 --> 2340.839
that's when I'm not strong

2338.619 --> 2343.54
right that's not happening at all now

2340.839 --> 2345.52
I'm I'm very stable I'm very strong it

2343.54 --> 2348.099
might even be because of the ashwagandha

2345.52 --> 2350.32
but also just today

2348.099 --> 2351.46
just good energy

2350.32 --> 2355.38
today

2351.46 --> 2355.38
ever tried Kratom no

2355.54 --> 2360.839
I've heard of it through Owen Benjamin

2357.94 --> 2360.839
I'm not no

2361.06 --> 2363.9
I'm fine

2365.32 --> 2371.1400000000003
don't have some extreme trauma breaking

2368.56 --> 2374.02
out in sweat with like pain and all that

2371.14 --> 2376.859
[ __ ] I don't have extreme trauma okay

2374.02 --> 2376.859
like that

2378.7 --> 2385.48
I have very refined spiritual trauma

2384.16 --> 2389.859
it's like

2385.48 --> 2392.38
or arguably caused my Dark World Vision

2389.859 --> 2395.8199999999997
partially or as a side effect of that

2392.38 --> 2395.82
and drugs so I've had like

2397.48 --> 2400.44
ah

2400.48 --> 2405.82
God now look what I'm letting roll out

2403.78 --> 2408.2200000000003
of my mouth what had happened to me

2405.82 --> 2411.339
basically would probably be classified

2408.22 --> 2414.2799999999997
within the psycho psycho

2411.339 --> 2417.16
see the psychology scene

2414.28 --> 2419.88
as a bad drug reaction that led to

2417.16 --> 2419.8799999999997
psychosis

2420.46 --> 2427.0
except

2422.38 --> 2429.88
it's not like totally oh no not reality

2427.0 --> 2433.839
anymore type psychosis it was really

2429.88 --> 2436.38
subtle like I got lost in a very surreal

2433.839 --> 2436.38
experience

2437.26 --> 2442.119
right

2438.82 --> 2446.04
I did it didn't break my mind but it it

2442.119 --> 2448.6600000000003
broke my spirit in a ways like

2446.04 --> 2450.88
disjointed me it was a very surreal

2448.66 --> 2453.22
experience and very nightmarish also

2450.88 --> 2455.8
because like I didn't

2453.22 --> 2458.0789999999997
function the way I'm used to functioning

2455.8 --> 2460.96
it's like I wasn't in my own body in

2458.079 --> 2462.3390000000004
ways even though I was very much so but

2460.96 --> 2463.66
it didn't work

2462.339 --> 2466.18
the same

2463.66 --> 2467.3199999999997
reality in that experience didn't work

2466.18 --> 2470.2599999999998
the same

2467.32 --> 2472.1800000000003
like there was no physicality to it it's

2470.26 --> 2477.119
really bizarre

2472.18 --> 2477.1189999999997
and I was too deep into that too long

2477.7 --> 2480.96
80 freaking years

2482.859 --> 2486.8199999999997
it's what in general it was just too

2485.619 --> 2489.76
long

2486.82 --> 2492.94
like I at the end I was just so tired at

2489.76 --> 2495.82
the end so tired

2492.94 --> 2498.94
like so tired I I like genuinely wanted

2495.82 --> 2503.6400000000003
to die it's like I just want this to end

2498.94 --> 2503.64
please please God let me go please

2505.839 --> 2512.2599999999998
on the other hand I struggled because I

2509.26 --> 2514.119
was like refusing to give in to that so

2512.26 --> 2517.2400000000002
for some reason I held on within that

2514.119 --> 2519.7000000000003
experience for too long because I was

2517.24 --> 2521.56
afraid and it went crazy

2519.7 --> 2523.4199999999996
it's like at the one time it's like no I

2521.56 --> 2525.7
wanted to end and then the other so I

2523.42 --> 2527.6800000000003
was like no you have to keep it up as

2525.7 --> 2529.8999999999996
long as possible so

2527.68 --> 2531.8799999999997
if you have to be go through more

2529.9 --> 2534.339
torturous things then that is worth it

2531.88 --> 2537.54
but then it didn't seem like worth it

2534.339 --> 2537.54
and it's just everything

2540.839 --> 2547.119
it's hard to describe how [ __ ] up that

2544.0 --> 2550.06
experience was in many ways it was hell

2547.119 --> 2552.1600000000003
it's and it in hell that people usually

2550.06 --> 2555.18
don't get to experience

2552.16 --> 2555.18
that up close

2565.48 --> 2568.2
anyway

2569.7 --> 2575.68
yeah

2571.3 --> 2575.6800000000003
it brings paranoia nah

2577.72 --> 2582.9399999999996
right but yeah I'm not

2580.42 --> 2585.7000000000003
the drugs

2582.94 --> 2588.64
like cannabis hasn't

2585.7 --> 2591.7
really directly been involved

2588.64 --> 2594.4
in that process

2591.7 --> 2597.16
the influence that cannabis has on me is

2594.4 --> 2600.579
much more like social

2597.16 --> 2603.16
as a social influence

2600.579 --> 2608.6800000000003
different kinds positive and negative

2603.16 --> 2611.6189999999997
but that it didn't cause that thing

2608.68 --> 2614.56
that thing was caused by drugs that was

2611.619 --> 2616.839
given to me by somebody else I don't

2614.56 --> 2619.48
even literally I literally don't know

2616.839 --> 2623.04
what it exactly was but I got the idea

2619.48 --> 2623.04
that it was really refined

2623.68 --> 2630.52
like Ayahuasca or LSD of some kind

2627.88 --> 2632.56
but like he engineered it

2630.52 --> 2635.14
that got the impression I don't know if

2632.56 --> 2637.119
he that he probably personally did it in

2635.14 --> 2642.5789999999997
a laboratory

2637.119 --> 2645.46
it was all lit but just that alone was

2642.579 --> 2648.3390000000004
all so mind-blowing to me I was like I

2645.46 --> 2651.76
felt back then like I'm getting this

2648.339 --> 2654.46
sudden entry to like something that I

2651.76 --> 2658.3190000000004
don't even believe it could exist

2654.46 --> 2658.319
like there was I couldn't

2658.359 --> 2664.72
I couldn't not go there

2661.54 --> 2666.52
it was all so unbelievably magic like a

2664.72 --> 2669.359
door to the Gods

2666.52 --> 2669.359
all of a sudden

2670.18 --> 2677.14
to me before I knew it now I I know what

2674.02 --> 2678.88
happened but still it is still so

2677.14 --> 2681.5789999999997
mind-blowing to me when how everything

2678.88 --> 2684.579
that happened in it

2681.579 --> 2688.02
the vision was

2684.579 --> 2688.02
it's unbelievable

2692.5 --> 2697.3
it's like what you can experience there

2694.72 --> 2699.52
is more than a normal person would just

2697.3 --> 2703.54
be able to handle

2699.52 --> 2705.64
like people that could for some reason I

2703.54 --> 2708.7
don't exactly know how it works it just

2705.64 --> 2711.7599999999998
I just got it from somebody didn't know

2708.7 --> 2714.64
anything about it the weight the exact

2711.76 --> 2717.46
Subs I didn't know anything about what I

2714.64 --> 2719.14
was taking it was all pure magic to me

2717.46 --> 2721.839
okay

2719.14 --> 2725.5789999999997
and it's like one [ __ ] time with

2721.839 --> 2725.5789999999997
Echoes that just never stopped

2727.42 --> 2732.4
just parallel universe and I didn't even

2730.66 --> 2734.859
understand it

2732.4 --> 2737.44
I sometimes I didn't even recognize that

2734.859 --> 2739.72
it was not the physical reality it had

2737.44 --> 2741.64
several moments where I would just try

2739.72 --> 2743.4399999999996
to start talking about like

2741.64 --> 2746.56
do you remember this and that happening

2743.44 --> 2748.2400000000002
and like how and it's like I don't know

2746.56 --> 2750.7
what you're talking about

2748.24 --> 2752.9199999999996
like but

2750.7 --> 2755.3799999999997
like we were there

2752.92 --> 2758.079
and then they just don't

2755.38 --> 2760.0
they really didn't know it's like

2758.079 --> 2762.1600000000003
I couldn't tell

2760.0 --> 2764.26
it's like experiences were placed in

2762.16 --> 2767.56
between that hadn't actually happened

2764.26 --> 2770.7400000000002
when to my memory is exactly like it

2767.56 --> 2773.5
really happened and there was like

2770.74 --> 2775.72
a valuable information even being

2773.5 --> 2776.98
exchanged it's like I got all answers

2775.72 --> 2779.3799999999997
from people

2776.98 --> 2781.78
that in the physical world never gave me

2779.38 --> 2784.359
those answers but those answers were

2781.78 --> 2787.8390000000004
really good it's like ah

2784.359 --> 2791.619
and I it would just happen

2787.839 --> 2794.38
it's not like oh the drugs oh I the

2791.619 --> 2798.04
spell is classed now I get the real ads

2794.38 --> 2800.44
no it would just happen unannounced

2798.04 --> 2802.42
unexpected

2800.44 --> 2805.78
okay

2802.42 --> 2808.2400000000002
it was [ __ ] surreal and freaky to be

2805.78 --> 2810.52
me and I went through of definite

2808.24 --> 2812.9199999999996
savonie phase with it because I felt

2810.52 --> 2815.44
like I am like

2812.92 --> 2816.88
there's something really bizarre magical

2815.44 --> 2819.7000000000003
about me and I am like an

2816.88 --> 2823.359
interdimensional TR I was like oh I am

2819.7 --> 2824.6189999999997
the high wizard I was going full savanye

2823.359 --> 2827.56
on that [ __ ]

2824.619 --> 2830.6800000000003
but barely communicating it because I

2827.56 --> 2834.16
every time I would start talking about

2830.68 --> 2837.3999999999996
it I would immediately feel that bubbles

2834.16 --> 2841.48
like that Separates Me from everybody

2837.4 --> 2844.9
else I would start to feel it like

2841.48 --> 2847.3
they will never accept what I'm saying

2844.9 --> 2849.88
right now even though I am basing it on

2847.3 --> 2853.26
my own experience like people will just

2849.88 --> 2853.26
never accept it

2858.88 --> 2867.0
that's what it was like a lot

2862.78 --> 2867.0
especially like in my early 20s

2871.26 --> 2875.26
right

2872.98 --> 2879.06
but I'm really glad that I'm out of all

2875.26 --> 2879.0600000000004
that I am really glad of it

2883.06 --> 2886.7799999999997
because effectively the experience was

2885.7 --> 2890.5789999999997
bad

2886.78 --> 2890.579
and I have to keep reminding myself

2896.38 --> 2902.46
man I'm having like all kinds of weird

2898.859 --> 2902.46
Sensations right now

2908.04 --> 2912.579
right but anyway let's leave that all

2911.5 --> 2915.22
behind

2912.579 --> 2918.099
for now

2915.22 --> 2921.5789999999997
Let It Go

2918.099 --> 2924.06
do not get stuck with my spirit in that

2921.579 --> 2924.0600000000004
[ __ ] again

2924.28 --> 2930.94
you should eat it yeah it might be that

2928.359 --> 2932.56
I'm just gonna take like a bite from a

2930.94 --> 2934.92
piece of bread or something I'll be

2932.56 --> 2934.92
right back

3006.119 --> 3008.3
thank you

3059.66 --> 3063.14
and then back

3070.5 --> 3072.92
foreign

3076.02 --> 3080.0
with pseudoscience DJ

3082.44 --> 3086.48
which pseudoscience are you talking

3084.18 --> 3086.48
about

3100.619 --> 3105.7400000000002
I believe in unproven things what does

3103.26 --> 3105.7400000000002
that mean

3109.339 --> 3114.44
which unproven thing do I believe in

3115.859 --> 3118.859
miracles

3119.04 --> 3121.7
no

3123.72 --> 3130.7
and Magic

3126.839 --> 3130.7
well magic is real

3130.859 --> 3133.7
palpable

3133.74 --> 3138.7799999999997
provable

3135.48 --> 3141.78
so a lot of it is psychological

3138.78 --> 3144.0
but it's definitely real it's not

3141.78 --> 3146.3390000000004
unproven I mean there's literally

3144.0 --> 3148.98
professions for it yeah it's not because

3146.339 --> 3152.339
it's fake

3148.98 --> 3154.92
because the trickery is real yeah and

3152.339 --> 3156.96
Flat Earth there's gigantic amounts of

3154.92 --> 3161.46
proof for that

3156.96 --> 3164.579
all things prove that the Earth is flat

3161.46 --> 3166.98
all things there's no thing that doesn't

3164.579 --> 3169.44
prove that the Earth is flat all things

3166.98 --> 3173.94
prove the Earth is flat

3169.44 --> 3177.319
because it's all based off flat planes

3173.94 --> 3177.319
geometry itself

3179.94 --> 3182.48
all of it

3183.599 --> 3188.9
what experiment

3185.819 --> 3188.9
proved Magic

3189.11 --> 3194.52
[Music]

3191.76 --> 3197.4
well it's not physics

3194.52 --> 3199.74
you can't prove physics

3197.4 --> 3201.78
you can't prove magic with physics it's

3199.74 --> 3203.64
not about that because it has to do with

3201.78 --> 3205.559
consciousness

3203.64 --> 3208.0789999999997
and the spirit

3205.559 --> 3210.1800000000003
and that doesn't fall in the category of

3208.079 --> 3214.2200000000003
physics like that so you're you're

3210.18 --> 3214.22
asking about the wrong field

3220.619 --> 3226.2000000000003
so just because it's not physics doesn't

3223.92 --> 3229.04
mean it isn't real it just means it's

3226.2 --> 3229.04
not physics

3235.859 --> 3241.5589999999997
no no yeah oh you don't want to make me

3238.859 --> 3245.2799999999997
mad yeah but then start stop spouting

3241.559 --> 3247.38
[ __ ] yeah Jay ah how about that stop

3245.28 --> 3249.3590000000004
spouting [ __ ]

3260.64 --> 3266.4
believe it isn't you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3263.579 --> 3268.8
and there's no excuse there's absolutely

3266.4 --> 3272.579

3275.339 --> 3279.2999999999997

if there is no reason for me to do so if

3311.22 --> 3318.02
I'm just upholding a hoax of supposed

3313.92 --> 3321.78
Flat Earth no no I'm not gonna spend

3318.02 --> 3324.839

blabbermouth [ __ ]

3415.559 --> 3422.7200000000003
telling me how

3417.98 --> 3422.72
y'all the pseudoscience of Flat Earth

3423.059 --> 3430.079
piss off

3425.579 --> 3432.2400000000002
not even talking about it yeah Paul [ __ ]

3430.079 --> 3434.8390000000004
not everything is about your [ __ ]

3432.24 --> 3434.839
ball okay

3436.859 --> 3440.0589999999997
oh evil nightmare

3444.0 --> 3447.0
foreign

3464.72 --> 3469.4399999999996
by the way tiger bear what you said

3467.04 --> 3471.48
earlier oh that's like

3469.44 --> 3473.7000000000003
12 minutes ago

3471.48 --> 3475.92
used to consider myself an open-minded

3473.7 --> 3479.72
person then I realized there are some

3475.92 --> 3479.7200000000003
things I don't want to be open to

3484.68 --> 3490.7599999999998
but you only get to that point if you're

3487.26 --> 3490.76
actually getting real

3491.579 --> 3497.099
right if you're just a blabbermouthing

3494.339 --> 3500.16
virtual signaling ass

3497.099 --> 3503.04
you can start keep claiming things even

3500.16 --> 3505.92
though you've never even been

3503.04 --> 3508.2
in contact with any of it

3505.92 --> 3510.119
and it'll keep blabbermouthing that but

3508.2 --> 3513.4199999999996
yeah if you're actually out there and

3510.119 --> 3515.52
standing behind what you believe in

3513.42 --> 3517.079
then you're gonna find out that with

3515.52 --> 3519.42
open-mindedness

3517.079 --> 3522.02
there will also be deranged peoples

3519.42 --> 3522.02
living in

3522.42 --> 3528.859
and that it will warp the preface of

3526.2 --> 3528.859
your beliefs

3529.14 --> 3532.859
then you realize like yeah no no

3531.299 --> 3535.319
actually

3532.859 --> 3539.54
it's not about openness and freedom it's

3535.319 --> 3539.54
about having the right rules

3544.26 --> 3548.28
and when you have the right rules then

3546.059 --> 3551.099
you have a lot of freedom

3548.28 --> 3553.1400000000003
but not freedom from God

3551.099 --> 3554.76
away from God

3553.14 --> 3558.96
but

3554.76 --> 3563.9
Freedom thanks to the right rules

3558.96 --> 3563.9
the right rules give you freedom

3564.0 --> 3568.4
wrong rules take away freedom

3586.16 --> 3589.64
anyways yeah

3593.04 --> 3597.5589999999997
maybe Banning him was too hard I'll just

3598.079 --> 3601.579
leave it to a timeout

3603.54 --> 3608.52
but if he's gonna start spamming again

3606.0 --> 3611.48
like that I will just kick him out I

3608.52 --> 3611.48
don't like people that

3613.92 --> 3620.7200000000003
post endless amounts of messages and

3616.619 --> 3620.7200000000003
don't say anything really interesting

3625.97 --> 3629.0299999999997
[Music]

3629.46 --> 3636.9
all right anyway we're halfway to show

3633.0 --> 3640.76
oh that piece of bread was very

3636.9 --> 3640.76
nice and I take another one

3643.079 --> 3647.579
stop

3644.099 --> 3649.559
when he stops the nonsense

3647.579 --> 3651.7200000000003
okay

3649.559 --> 3654.48
Maybe

3651.72 --> 3656.16
it's just that his baltaria is very

3654.48 --> 3658.26
annoying

3656.16 --> 3660.8999999999996
yeah if you're gonna say oh that's all

3658.26 --> 3663.1800000000003
very interesting except for the suicide

3660.9 --> 3665.64
that's literally oh but I have blockages

3663.18 --> 3669.18
so now I can't classify that other

3665.64 --> 3671.7
analysis that is really good I can't

3669.18 --> 3673.5
classify that as good because I'm a

3671.7 --> 3676.6189999999997
[ __ ] ball Target

3673.5 --> 3678.78
and I can't see those things as good

3676.619 --> 3681.319
can't get into them because you're

3678.78 --> 3681.3190000000004
blocked

3687.48 --> 3692.76
propose to eat

3690.24 --> 3694.4399999999996
yeah so what

3692.76 --> 3696.619
what do you think you got some kind of

3694.44 --> 3696.619
credit

3698.28 --> 3707.2200000000003
dude you can't make demands here or lay

3703.14 --> 3709.5789999999997
claims about me or whatever like that

3707.22 --> 3709.5789999999997
dude

3711.66 --> 3717.98
in a pragmatic or just pushy

3715.079 --> 3717.98
just pushy

3724.98 --> 3729.26
some good evidence for what

3730.02 --> 3734.94
for what for your ball for your ball

3732.54 --> 3738.44
tardia

3734.94 --> 3738.44
you haven't provided anything

3739.68 --> 3745.319
you're just starting to point out oh oh

3742.38 --> 3747.54
Magic is not physics yeah no [ __ ]

3745.319 --> 3751.7599999999998
Sherlock wow

3747.54 --> 3751.7599999999998
what a perception like I don't know that

3753.18 --> 3758.04
can't it's not perceived as pushy it is

3756.24 --> 3759.359
pushy

3758.04 --> 3761.7
yeah

3759.359 --> 3763.38
can't just roll in here especially after

3761.7 --> 3766.14
having been time out

3763.38 --> 3768.54
just telling me Oh I helped you with

3766.14 --> 3770.52
that what like I owe you with because

3768.54 --> 3771.24
you told me to get to get something to

3770.52 --> 3774.96
eat

3771.24 --> 3776.3999999999996
yeah I told me that I was hungry

3774.96 --> 3778.5
before that

3776.4 --> 3780.42
yeah you reminded me that doesn't mean

3778.5 --> 3782.96
that I owe you now

3780.42 --> 3782.96
okay

3784.619 --> 3790.28
that's pushy

3786.96 --> 3790.28
I don't like that attitude

3797.48 --> 3802.22
photographs and videos

3800.22 --> 3805.3799999999997
yeah

3802.22 --> 3808.5589999999997
I don't have to refute your stupid

3805.38 --> 3811.6800000000003
pictures they're not photographs and

3808.559 --> 3812.94
there's no photograph of a ball Earth

3811.68 --> 3816.14
can't

3812.94 --> 3816.14
because it's not a ball

3816.299 --> 3821.299
you can't Photoshop it together to make

3818.4 --> 3821.299
it look like a ball

3822.599 --> 3831.44
as literally admitted by a NASA employee

3827.52 --> 3833.099
who edited those pictures of Earth

3831.44 --> 3836.4
[Music]

3833.099 --> 3838.94
yeah yeah it's Photoshop because it it

3836.4 --> 3838.94
has to be

3840.059 --> 3844.8700000000003
that's an admission on camera not not

3842.76 --> 3848.0800000000004
retracted

3844.87 --> 3848.08
[Music]

3851.599 --> 3856.38
yeah what you lay before me is [ __ ]

3854.46 --> 3858.9
it's not a physics argument either yeah

3856.38 --> 3861.7200000000003
pictures are not a physics argument for

3858.9 --> 3863.7000000000003
starters ah

3861.72 --> 3865.3799999999997
it's not scientific evidence or a

3863.7 --> 3866.5789999999997
picture yeah a picture is not scientific

3865.38 --> 3869.42
evidence

3866.579 --> 3873.319
scientific evidence come from

3869.42 --> 3876.9
establishing a phenomenon and then very

3873.319 --> 3878.94
manipulating what causes that phenomenon

3876.9 --> 3880.319
in order to establish the cause of the

3878.94 --> 3883.98
effect

3880.319 --> 3887.339
yeah a picture it's not scientific

3883.98 --> 3890.46
evidence especially when you claim that

3887.339 --> 3893.7599999999998
the picture is taken from a second law

3890.46 --> 3897.26
of Thermodynamics violating conceptual

3893.76 --> 3897.26
medium of outer space

3899.52 --> 3905.94
there is no such place there could not

3901.799 --> 3909.0
be such a place because we're breathing

3905.94 --> 3911.52
and if there were such a thing as outer

3909.0 --> 3915.839
space surrounding Earth

3911.52 --> 3916.74
and all the gas here what would explode

3915.839 --> 3920.16
off

3916.74 --> 3922.68
and thin out to absolutely nothing

3920.16 --> 3924.96
to spread out in the available volume of

3922.68 --> 3927.359
the universe

3924.96 --> 3930.18
and it would be very much instantaneous

3927.359 --> 3932.4
and no amount of forces could prevent

3930.18 --> 3936.4199999999996
that from happening right

3932.4 --> 3937.98
I can argue that even a freaking black

3936.42 --> 3942.0
hole

3937.98 --> 3945.599
would not be able to prevent

3942.0 --> 3947.579
with all its presumed bending strength

3945.599 --> 3949.8590000000004
and all that even bending light well

3947.579 --> 3952.44
guess what I don't think at the strength

3949.859 --> 3954.5989999999997
of a black hole is strong enough to

3952.44 --> 3957.119
prevent the gas

3954.599 --> 3960.0
wherever it may be in relation to said

3957.119 --> 3962.819
black hole to expand in all directions

3960.0 --> 3965.7
to to fill the available space because

3962.819 --> 3970.859
the amount of force that will be hind

3965.7 --> 3973.3799999999997
gas expanding into a massive insanely

3970.859 --> 3976.2599999999998
Big Value volume

3973.38 --> 3978.6600000000003
is going to be proportional

3976.26 --> 3982.2000000000003
so the power with which it will spread

3978.66 --> 3986.339
out will be enormous so much that even

3982.2 --> 3988.6189999999997
the pulling strength of a virtual idea

3986.339 --> 3990.7799999999997
of a black hole would not be able to

3988.619 --> 3993.48
stop it from spreading around and

3990.78 --> 3996.2400000000002
filling the universe okay there's no

3993.48 --> 3998.88
[ __ ] way gravity even in black hole

3996.24 --> 4000.2599999999998
strength could prevent gas from

3998.88 --> 4003.7400000000002
expanding and filling the available

4000.26 --> 4005.9
volume of the universe okay

4003.74 --> 4008.8999999999996
are we clear on that

4005.9 --> 4008.9
yeah

4014.78 --> 4019.099
the Earth is either contained and there

4017.059 --> 4020.8390000000004
is no outer space no outer space we

4019.099 --> 4022.88
could get to or even establish that it

4020.839 --> 4026.7799999999997
is a thing

4022.88 --> 4029.599
or there's just no outer space at all

4026.78 --> 4031.46
there is no outer space it can't have it

4029.599 --> 4033.7400000000002
can be there you can't have an open

4031.46 --> 4036.44
system to outer space and go there with

4033.74 --> 4039.3799999999997
rockets and have gas pressure sticking

4036.44 --> 4043.339
to this microscopic

4039.38 --> 4047.42
a little place with that thickness

4043.339 --> 4049.88
versus the colossal volume of outer

4047.42 --> 4052.4
space there is no conceivable way that

4049.88 --> 4055.1600000000003
any force in the universe no matter how

4052.4 --> 4058.039
strong could prevent that gas in that

4055.16 --> 4060.02
precise location in the miniature little

4058.039 --> 4062.7200000000003
spot in the volume of the universe

4060.02 --> 4065.48
there's no force that could prevent it

4062.72 --> 4067.7
from exploding in all directions the

4065.48 --> 4069.799
average out in the volume of the

4067.7 --> 4073.2799999999997
universe okay

4069.799 --> 4077.74
yeah because gas pressure expansion in

4073.28 --> 4080.9
available volume is a very powerful

4077.74 --> 4083.839
entropic Force

4080.9 --> 4085.76
it is part of the laws of nature it

4083.839 --> 4087.44
cannot be stopped

4085.76 --> 4091.6600000000003
you see

4087.44 --> 4091.66
it's one of the strongest forces

4091.88 --> 4099.7390000000005
yeah gas pressure expansion in lower

4094.76 --> 4103.819
pressures it will is Unstoppable

4099.739 --> 4107.48
only a physical obstructing barrier that

4103.819 --> 4109.279
can take all that pressure can stop it

4107.48 --> 4111.259
a container

4109.279 --> 4114.080000000001
that's the only thing that can prevent

4111.259 --> 4116.299
gas pressure from explosively expanding

4114.08 --> 4120.699
in all directions

4116.299 --> 4120.699
like unheard of force of explosion

4123.319 --> 4127.759
yeah

4125.0 --> 4130.1
gas pressure is very powerful when

4127.759 --> 4132.08
exposed to extreme low pressure like a

4130.1 --> 4135.799
vacuum is very powerful

4132.08 --> 4139.1
bigger the volume the gas will certainly

4135.799 --> 4140.66
be able to fill the more explosive power

4139.1 --> 4143.96
happens

4140.66 --> 4145.8189999999995
to instantaneously make all that gas

4143.96 --> 4147.08
suddenly displace into the available

4145.819 --> 4149.4800000000005
volume

4147.08 --> 4150.699
now if you have enormous amounts of

4149.48 --> 4154.58
available

4150.699 --> 4159.139999999999
vacuated volume and then suddenly a bit

4154.58 --> 4160.88
again that that's just boom instant it's

4159.14 --> 4163.339
all gone boom

4160.88 --> 4166.6990000000005
nothing can stop it nothing

4163.339 --> 4169.759
yeah that's called natural law

4166.699 --> 4172.16
it's called there is no gas pressure

4169.759 --> 4174.799
without a container physical

4172.16 --> 4176.299
are effectively physical physically

4174.799 --> 4179.199
obstructing

4176.299 --> 4179.199
container

4180.5 --> 4186.799
yeah so your pictures from outer space

4183.44 --> 4189.62
that's super cute but that can't exist

4186.799 --> 4193.04
natural law proves the contrary it

4189.62 --> 4195.679
violates the fundamentals of physics

4193.04 --> 4198.56
understanding

4195.679 --> 4201.34
that picture cannot be what you say it

4198.56 --> 4206.6
is because that's physically impossible

4201.34 --> 4210.26
under every conceivable circumstance

4206.6 --> 4211.88
yeah you can model the physics

4210.26 --> 4213.26
of the globe

4211.88 --> 4216.14
like that

4213.26 --> 4218.54
it doesn't work you can you can meddle

4216.14 --> 4220.34
with geometry and calculus and all that

4218.54 --> 4223.159
and all the positions and the Angles and

4220.34 --> 4224.84
oh that's super cute yeah physics yeah

4223.159 --> 4228.0199999999995
good luck with that

4224.84 --> 4229.219
yeah show me your physics model of ball

4228.02 --> 4230.84
Earth

4229.219 --> 4232.46
yeah

4230.84 --> 4234.02
yeah no it's not going to work though

4232.46 --> 4236.719
because there's a me it's going to be

4234.02 --> 4238.6990000000005
surrounded by exemptions everywhere like

4236.719 --> 4241.1
oh you have to treat gas like a fluid

4238.699 --> 4242.659
and because it has to go down go boom

4241.1 --> 4246.4400000000005
boom even though there's no force and

4242.659 --> 4249.5
it's just a massive cluster [ __ ]

4246.44 --> 4252.259999999999
of incompatibilities with physics

4249.5 --> 4254.9
that's what the ball Earth is it's

4252.26 --> 4257.3
incompatible with physics it doesn't

4254.9 --> 4260.239
work at all

4257.3 --> 4263.4800000000005
Works maybe with a little math a little

4260.239 --> 4265.639999999999
geometry geometry bending [ __ ] in your

4263.48 --> 4269.839999999999
mind you can even fool yourself with

4265.64 --> 4271.9400000000005
Optics by just ignoring perspective in

4269.84 --> 4273.14
your model it's very cute that that can

4271.94 --> 4275.54
work

4273.14 --> 4278.360000000001
when it comes to physics yeah you're

4275.54 --> 4281.06
screwed because nothing about physics

4278.36 --> 4285.799999999999
allows you

4281.06 --> 4288.88
to just assume these nonsensical things

4285.8 --> 4288.88
like outer space

4288.98 --> 4291.459999999999
right

4291.8 --> 4295.06
it's impossible

4297.52 --> 4303.92
oh here it goes again

4300.64 --> 4305.96
the body of science oh you think you're

4303.92 --> 4309.14
a new blab break this kind of nonsense

4305.96 --> 4311.54
dude we've had people blabber us that

4309.14 --> 4313.76
kind of nonsense baseless assertion

4311.54 --> 4315.92
without content yeah

4313.76 --> 4318.08
endless amounts of evidence Oh you mean

4315.92 --> 4319.82
endless amounts of empty boxes where

4318.08 --> 4322.64
there is actually no evidence yeah yeah

4319.82 --> 4328.34
we've heard it before on a daily basis

4322.64 --> 4330.38
for almost a decade JJ a decade on a

4328.34 --> 4333.26
daily basis you think you're new saying

4330.38 --> 4336.679
that you think that's gonna work

4333.26 --> 4339.679
there is no evidence there's just a lot

4336.679 --> 4342.14
of bluff of evidence

4339.679 --> 4344.12
and then when said evidence is actually

4342.14 --> 4346.84
highlighted turns out it's just another

4344.12 --> 4346.84
empty box

4360.14 --> 4363.9400000000005
you guys are unbearable

4369.32 --> 4373.48
I don't know why you think that's a nice

4371.179 --> 4373.4800000000005
guy

4374.84 --> 4377.5
he's not

4381.98 --> 4387.339999999999
there's a wall tart both Tarts are not

4384.739 --> 4387.339999999999
nice guys

4387.44 --> 4391.699
they'd be nice guys if they got their

4389.54 --> 4393.56
ball tardia under control

4391.699 --> 4395.178999999999
like a lot of other people that like to

4393.56 --> 4398.42
visit my chat and they got it under

4395.179 --> 4399.8
control they know they know when they

4398.42 --> 4402.679
should stop

4399.8 --> 4405.14
yeah you become nice

4402.679 --> 4407.06
when you know when to stop when you know

4405.14 --> 4409.58
that you shouldn't continue and you

4407.06 --> 4411.05
shouldn't keep on blabbermouthing that's

4409.58 --> 4414.3
when you become nice

4411.05 --> 4414.3
[Music]

4421.28 --> 4423.88
foreign

4492.08 --> 4495.08
foreign

4545.78 --> 4548.5
good to see you

4564.86 --> 4569.86
mm-hmm

4567.14 --> 4569.860000000001
oh

4579.1 --> 4583.319
[Music]

4583.76 --> 4586.780000000001
what the hell

4592.64 --> 4598.76
yeah six star or no I'm doing fine it's

4595.94 --> 4600.739
just that my chat got all ball targeted

4598.76 --> 4603.02
again

4600.739 --> 4605.78
kind of sick of it

4603.02 --> 4608.320000000001
but I guess I'll let you guys just do

4605.78 --> 4608.32
your thing

4610.28 --> 4614.599999999999
I mean I laid I laid it down pretty well

4613.219 --> 4616.94
and

4614.6 --> 4619.64
I know it's all just gone on deaf ears

4616.94 --> 4621.5599999999995
anyway so

4619.64 --> 4625.820000000001
that's the thing it doesn't matter how

4621.56 --> 4629.42
well you explain something a detail

4625.82 --> 4631.94
from a flat earth side an argument it's

4629.42 --> 4634.04
not even it's just an argument of

4631.94 --> 4636.199
reality and when you argue that doesn't

4634.04 --> 4640.219
matter how well you've argued it it's

4636.199 --> 4643.4
all been completely ignored

4640.219 --> 4645.7390000000005
because because it has to be has to be

4643.4 --> 4648.139999999999
ignored because it's it's over

4645.739 --> 4650.839999999999
that's the whole point it's over it was

4648.14 --> 4653.54
over it's always been over stop wasting

4650.84 --> 4656.3
your own time with your nonsense belief

4653.54 --> 4658.78
you have any idea how freaking insane

4656.3 --> 4658.78
you look

4663.32 --> 4668.78
the whole [ __ ] about Ballers thinking

4666.8 --> 4671.96
that flat earthers are [ __ ] and

4668.78 --> 4674.86
insane it's a hundred percent projection

4671.96 --> 4679.1
100 projection

4674.86 --> 4681.38
exclusively a hundred percent projection

4679.1 --> 4682.76
because you guys are [ __ ] out of your

4681.38 --> 4684.14
mind

4682.76 --> 4686.4800000000005
all of you

4684.14 --> 4689.96
you think that just because the entire

4686.48 --> 4691.639999999999
world is just like you believing in

4689.96 --> 4694.28
something that [ __ ] that it's okay

4691.64 --> 4698.96
it isn't it's satanic it's all wrong and

4694.28 --> 4701.9
you ignore very solid information

4698.96 --> 4704.719
to entertain your delusion

4701.9 --> 4706.48
and it's egregious

4704.719 --> 4710.0
it's bad

4706.48 --> 4713.259999999999
it's bad for you it's bad for everybody

4710.0 --> 4713.26
that does that

4715.719 --> 4722.84
yeah I find

4718.46 --> 4725.2390000000005
science fiction very entertaining

4722.84 --> 4726.5
of me a good Star Wars movie like the

4725.239 --> 4727.699
old ones

4726.5 --> 4730.219
right

4727.699 --> 4733.28
or I like it

4730.219 --> 4736.159
but I know it's fake and it can never be

4733.28 --> 4739.04
ever it's fake it's the magic of

4736.159 --> 4742.219
something a virtual thing that cannot

4739.04 --> 4744.08
exist that can be made to virtually

4742.219 --> 4746.6
exist

4744.08 --> 4750.5599999999995
yeah it's a place that doesn't exist a

4746.6 --> 4753.02
place of make believe that has been

4750.56 --> 4755.54
established

4753.02 --> 4758.540000000001
and it's like it is real

4755.54 --> 4760.82
it's real in people's mind because it

4758.54 --> 4762.56
can't physically exist ever and I'm very

4760.82 --> 4765.799999999999
much aware of that and I'm okay with

4762.56 --> 4768.5
that I think it's magic it is Magic

4765.8 --> 4770.900000000001
space is Magic

4768.5 --> 4774.38
it's something that's so convincing it's

4770.9 --> 4779.659
there because of all the the art that

4774.38 --> 4781.88
surrounds it and all the 3D modeling and

4779.659 --> 4785.62
all that

4781.88 --> 4785.62
but it doesn't exist

4785.659 --> 4792.379999999999
but it's been made very convincingly

4789.5 --> 4796.159
even though if you go by very reasoning

4792.38 --> 4797.84
and foundations of logic even

4796.159 --> 4801.62
physics

4797.84 --> 4805.84
it can't be real It's Magic because you

4801.62 --> 4805.84
want it to be real but it isn't real

4808.52 --> 4813.38
and you wanting it to be real is what

4811.46 --> 4816.08
makes you

4813.38 --> 4818.36
susceptible to manipulation by Wizards

4816.08 --> 4821.0
because Wizards will tell you what you

4818.36 --> 4822.86
want to hear and you'll do things for

4821.0 --> 4825.14
that

4822.86 --> 4827.86
you give them your loyalty you'll give

4825.14 --> 4827.860000000001
them your money

4827.96 --> 4832.84
for them deluding you with something

4830.42 --> 4836.96
that you can very much prove to yourself

4832.84 --> 4838.46
is absolutely factually incorrect the

4836.96 --> 4840.62
belief that the Earth is a globe and

4838.46 --> 4842.06
that there's such a thing as outer space

4840.62 --> 4844.64
cannot be

4842.06 --> 4847.34
it isn't the Earth is in the globe it's

4844.64 --> 4850.6990000000005
flat we don't know the full dimensions

4847.34 --> 4852.26
of the volume with which in which we

4850.699 --> 4853.46
reside

4852.26 --> 4856.280000000001
okay

4853.46 --> 4859.46
don't know what's out there

4856.28 --> 4863.48
do know that Celestial lights are not

4859.46 --> 4867.26
balls at fast distances

4863.48 --> 4869.718999999999
when you go up they disappear from sight

4867.26 --> 4872.84
when you go towards the Moon it doesn't

4869.719 --> 4877.46
increase in angular size as would happen

4872.84 --> 4879.26
if you'd approach a physical object

4877.46 --> 4882.92
yeah

4879.26 --> 4886.2390000000005
the entire idea of outer space is all

4882.92 --> 4886.2390000000005
completely bunk

4886.34 --> 4890.3
it doesn't exist it was always made

4888.199 --> 4892.82
believe it's been heavily heavily

4890.3 --> 4896.659000000001
reinforced over Generations

4892.82 --> 4899.659
it's only in your mind like that it

4896.659 --> 4903.32
doesn't actually exist

4899.659 --> 4906.98
and in a way it's kind of a miracle that

4903.32 --> 4909.32
that the mind and what we see can even

4906.98 --> 4912.259999999999
be tricked to the extent that it can be

4909.32 --> 4914.659
believed in that heavily

4912.26 --> 4916.820000000001
that's part of the magic

4914.659 --> 4920.0
the part of the magic is that the whole

4916.82 --> 4922.88
thing can be made so believable even

4920.0 --> 4926.02
though it's so provably not real

4922.88 --> 4926.02
that's the magic

4930.92 --> 4935.78
no you can't look at flatter scientific

4933.199 --> 4938.599999999999
evidence because Flat Earth doesn't have

4935.78 --> 4940.34
to anything to do with science nor does

4938.6 --> 4943.280000000001
the ball Earth

4940.34 --> 4944.179
yes science is the establishment of a

4943.28 --> 4946.639999999999
Cause

4944.179 --> 4950.659
of an effect

4946.64 --> 4953.06
yeah flat earth falls under geometry

4950.659 --> 4955.58
it's not science

4953.06 --> 4957.320000000001
it's geometry

4955.58 --> 4959.179
okay and there's plenty of geometric

4957.32 --> 4962.12
evidence I mean the Black Swan

4959.179 --> 4967.84
observation very much one

4962.12 --> 4967.84
very hardcore proof from within geometry

4970.699 --> 4976.699
the Earth was the ball that you claim it

4973.4 --> 4978.98
to be then the Horizon would be at a set

4976.699 --> 4982.04
distance and after that everything would

4978.98 --> 4985.218999999999
be obstructed accordingly well guess

4982.04 --> 4986.6
what there's there's been footage plenty

4985.219 --> 4990.44
of it

4986.6 --> 4991.6990000000005
of observation Heights of what is it one

4990.44 --> 4995.139999999999
foot

4991.699 --> 5000.04
and then seeing things

4995.14 --> 5002.88
several miles away that are at the same

5000.04 --> 5002.88
actual height

5003.34 --> 5010.12
okay like being on a beach and seeing

5007.0 --> 5013.54
another Beach miles away when you're

5010.12 --> 5015.64
like directly above the water that's

5013.54 --> 5018.28
physically impossible in every

5015.64 --> 5021.34
conceivable way if the Earth would be

5018.28 --> 5024.28
anything other than flat

5021.34 --> 5026.56
okay because

5024.28 --> 5028.659
light can't bend it doesn't Bend

5026.56 --> 5031.4800000000005
especially when the medium is

5028.659 --> 5034.42
homogeneous on that same height can't

5031.48 --> 5036.699
bend it only bends if there's a hard

5034.42 --> 5038.26
medium changes then it might change its

5036.699 --> 5040.12
angle a bit right yeah terrestrial

5038.26 --> 5044.26
fraction doesn't work it's not based on

5040.12 --> 5046.42
a realistic Optical effect

5044.26 --> 5049.84
so you can forget about that the Black

5046.42 --> 5052.719
Swan the simple observation

5049.84 --> 5055.84
something at a very fast distance yet

5052.719 --> 5058.0
having the observation I'd be very

5055.84 --> 5060.28
very small

5058.0 --> 5062.62
above ocean level for example or

5060.28 --> 5065.32
landlord whatever you're doing

5062.62 --> 5067.84
that proves that the Earth is not a glow

5065.32 --> 5071.0199999999995
that disproves the spherical geometry

5067.84 --> 5074.76
because if the Earth was actually a

5071.02 --> 5078.52
sphere then the Horizon would always be

5074.76 --> 5081.780000000001
obstructing things physically in the

5078.52 --> 5084.96
distance at a very consistent

5081.78 --> 5084.96
non-evading rate

5085.239 --> 5091.0
yeah you can't have an observation of a

5089.08 --> 5093.4
beach

5091.0 --> 5095.08
like what is it like 11 or seven miles

5093.4 --> 5098.739
away

5095.08 --> 5101.5599999999995
from the beach directly over the water

5098.739 --> 5103.12
with your camera you can't have that

5101.56 --> 5105.219
sighting

5103.12 --> 5107.44
if the Earth is a ball that's physically

5105.219 --> 5109.78
impossible

5107.44 --> 5112.36
you understand

5109.78 --> 5115.32
it disproves the spherical geometry the

5112.36 --> 5115.32
Earth is flat

5116.92 --> 5121.8
the Earth is flat it's not as Fair

5125.14 --> 5130.3
you're a Baltar dude float you don't

5127.719 --> 5133.06
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

5130.3 --> 5135.400000000001
I just gave a presentation like 10

5133.06 --> 5138.1
minutes or something

5135.4 --> 5141.159
just to explain this one [ __ ] thing

5138.1 --> 5142.6
in detail do you say it's flock you

5141.159 --> 5148.0199999999995
don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking

5142.6 --> 5148.02
about [ __ ] you're a ball [ __ ] JJ

5149.11 --> 5152.16
[Music]

5156.28 --> 5161.5599999999995
there is no experiment you goddamn

5159.58 --> 5163.3
[ __ ] how many times do I have to say

5161.56 --> 5169.9800000000005
that

5163.3 --> 5169.9800000000005
it's not physics it's geometry idiot

5172.3 --> 5176.08
can't have an experiment to prove a

5175.12 --> 5179.34
shape

5176.08 --> 5179.34
you dumbass

5184.13 --> 5187.1990000000005
[Music]

5192.1 --> 5197.860000000001
you can't use your eyes as precise tools

5194.5 --> 5199.659
who's talking about my eyes what you

5197.86 --> 5202.839999999999
don't think a camera

5199.659 --> 5205.179
a long distance camera is a precise tool

5202.84 --> 5207.219
how about a telescope

5205.179 --> 5208.96
telescope's not a precise tool either

5207.219 --> 5210.94
right you can aim a telescope

5208.96 --> 5213.639
horizontally right you know that right

5210.94 --> 5216.699
well that doesn't count either so you

5213.639 --> 5218.92
just can't use eyes then at all

5216.699 --> 5221.5599999999995
because nothing is where it really is oh

5218.92 --> 5223.42
how convenient

5221.56 --> 5225.76
nothing is where it really is so yeah

5223.42 --> 5228.159
then if nothing is really where it is

5225.76 --> 5231.3
well then the Earth can be a ball

5228.159 --> 5233.92
only have to warp everything everything

5231.3 --> 5235.54
and then the Earth can be a ball because

5233.92 --> 5237.04
everything is worked within world might

5235.54 --> 5238.84
just be a ball you know if nothing is

5237.04 --> 5241.84
where it really is and all that you know

5238.84 --> 5243.58
then why wouldn't it be a ball

5241.84 --> 5245.92
mean if everything is completely

5243.58 --> 5247.659
nonsensical then why wouldn't it be a

5245.92 --> 5250.36
ball right I mean all you have to do is

5247.659 --> 5251.92
just [ __ ] over the entire conceptual

5250.36 --> 5254.139
Universe in your mind and just

5251.92 --> 5256.4800000000005
completely make yourself psychotic and

5254.139 --> 5259.3
idiotic and then the Earth can be a ball

5256.48 --> 5261.9
it's all worth it right it's all worth

5259.3 --> 5261.900000000001
it for you

5266.8 --> 5270.88
yeah JJ I'm not having this discussion

5268.9 --> 5272.98
with you I'm [ __ ] sick of you just

5270.88 --> 5275.8
get the [ __ ] out

5272.98 --> 5279.0599999999995
you're a numpty [ __ ] and my show is

5275.8 --> 5281.9800000000005
not for you to waste [ __ ] two hours

5279.06 --> 5284.080000000001
bickering going through everything I'm

5281.98 --> 5285.94
not gonna go through everything because

5284.08 --> 5289.179
you're too [ __ ] [ __ ] to have

5285.94 --> 5291.9
picked up on that in the last 10 years

5289.179 --> 5294.9400000000005
[ __ ] off

5291.9 --> 5297.879999999999
just go and watch the [ __ ] shows

5294.94 --> 5301.599999999999
before this don't bicker with me because

5297.88 --> 5303.58
you didn't know all of that yeah

5301.6 --> 5306.52
you don't know [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm not

5303.58 --> 5308.38
gonna tell you everything because you're

5306.52 --> 5311.46
too [ __ ] [ __ ] to collect that

5308.38 --> 5311.46
information by yourself

5314.739 --> 5319.08
[ __ ] off too

5316.54 --> 5319.08
dick

5348.1 --> 5355.0
don't care for your ball-tartedness I

5352.179 --> 5357.159
don't give a [ __ ]

5355.0 --> 5359.94
I don't want to convince you I want you

5357.159 --> 5359.94
to [ __ ] off

5360.88 --> 5367.06
yeah I can't make you see a reason I can

5364.719 --> 5369.46
only share reason with you and if you

5367.06 --> 5372.42
refuse to open your [ __ ] eyes then

5369.46 --> 5372.42
get the [ __ ] out

5376.239 --> 5380.98
take your internal obstructions to

5379.12 --> 5383.0199999999995
reality somewhere else

5380.98 --> 5385.239
yeah I'm not here to entertain your

5383.02 --> 5388.2390000000005
delusion like a wizard

5385.239 --> 5390.58
like a ball wizard yeah I'm not here to

5388.239 --> 5393.94
reinforce your [ __ ] ball [ __ ] beliefs

5390.58 --> 5396.6
about nonsense that's impossible

5393.94 --> 5396.599999999999
okay

5421.3 --> 5425.26
what what if we are wrong about reality

5423.82 --> 5427.179
itself

5425.26 --> 5428.7390000000005
I don't know

5427.179 --> 5431.32
oh if you're wrong about that then

5428.739 --> 5433.0599999999995
you're just a solid system useless time

5431.32 --> 5436.179
wasting dick

5433.06 --> 5437.9800000000005
yeah so yeah sure what if what if we're

5436.179 --> 5440.4400000000005
wrong well then reality isn't reality

5437.98 --> 5443.0199999999995
then things don't work as logic then

5440.44 --> 5445.419999999999
there is no logic and then nothing

5443.02 --> 5447.639
really matters now does it so go be it

5445.42 --> 5450.04
brain in a jar somewhere I don't [ __ ]

5447.639 --> 5454.56
care you go be that brain in a jar where

5450.04 --> 5454.56
nothing matters I don't give a [ __ ] yeah

5458.26 --> 5463.96
the Earth is flat it's measurably

5460.719 --> 5465.76
provably flat does it have anything to

5463.96 --> 5468.12
do with physics it only has to do with

5465.76 --> 5471.9400000000005
geometry

5468.12 --> 5474.639
all right this flat there is no other

5471.94 --> 5477.04
reality

5474.639 --> 5478.06
all the other realities are all in your

5477.04 --> 5481.0
mind

5478.06 --> 5484.2390000000005
that you indulge yourself into because

5481.0 --> 5488.26
you allow [ __ ] reality warping

5484.239 --> 5490.78
nonsense in your mind like allow Satan

5488.26 --> 5492.400000000001
to [ __ ] your countries to [ __ ] with your

5490.78 --> 5494.98
consciousness

5492.4 --> 5498.839999999999
so you can indulge in the nonsense

5494.98 --> 5498.839999999999
delusion that is global

5507.42 --> 5512.38
ah

5509.159 --> 5513.699
can't be wrong according to math

5512.38 --> 5515.86
yeah

5513.699 --> 5518.0199999999995
yeah well reality itself can be wrong

5515.86 --> 5519.4
according to math you can prove anything

5518.02 --> 5522.280000000001
with math

5519.4 --> 5524.199
even things that are impossible so who

5522.28 --> 5528.219
gives a [ __ ]

5524.199 --> 5530.259999999999
if anything according to math who gives

5528.219 --> 5534.06
a [ __ ] about math dude

5530.26 --> 5534.06
meth doesn't prove anything

5536.8 --> 5539.8
foreign

5551.739 --> 5559.379999999999
it hasn't bothered okay Terry

5555.88 --> 5559.38
are you changing class

5563.02 --> 5567.42
dude where no nobility just yet

5575.219 --> 5578.639
peasants no better

5579.219 --> 5585.9
I can't tell

5582.159 --> 5585.9
I don't really know any peasants

5594.82 --> 5601.679
hey Dr bazakwood yeah

5598.42 --> 5601.679
thanks for that

5612.88 --> 5618.28
a farmer yeah but the whole um turret

5615.52 --> 5621.400000000001
this is a very different word a farmer

5618.28 --> 5623.88
is not the same thing as a peasant

5621.4 --> 5627.099999999999
foreign

5623.88 --> 5630.78
ER is a professional

5627.1 --> 5630.780000000001
peasant is a Slave

5631.08 --> 5637.719
peasant is specifically

5633.82 --> 5640.36
tied in with uh the monarchy class

5637.719 --> 5644.76
system it's very different

5640.36 --> 5644.759999999999
so a peasant doesn't have to be a farmer

5645.34 --> 5653.219
right a peasant can also just be

5649.12 --> 5653.219
somebody taking care of the horses

5654.58 --> 5658.739
right or a cook

5663.28 --> 5669.699
while a farmer is always going to be

5666.1 --> 5672.46
producing food and working the land and

5669.699 --> 5673.9
milking animals or

5672.46 --> 5676.38
breeding them

5673.9 --> 5676.379999999999
right

5680.92 --> 5686.86
and yeah the average farmer is a lot

5684.04 --> 5689.08
smarter than some farmers are smarter

5686.86 --> 5691.12
than peasants

5689.08 --> 5693.5199999999995
I mean Back In The Day The Peasants a

5691.12 --> 5695.62
lot of them were just so malnutritioned

5693.52 --> 5697.96
that they just didn't have their

5695.62 --> 5700.0599999999995
faculties available to them and on

5697.96 --> 5703.78
purpose

5700.06 --> 5707.7390000000005
they were were food was held back to

5703.78 --> 5709.679
keep them dumb and complacent I mean

5707.739 --> 5713.0199999999995
that supposed

5709.679 --> 5715.32
Nazi tactic I mean it's just medieval

5713.02 --> 5715.320000000001
[ __ ]

5716.32 --> 5722.219
starving people to make them complacent

5718.42 --> 5722.219
it's like as old as time itself

5728.08 --> 5730.62
hmm

5734.139 --> 5738.88
right but

5736.179 --> 5741.159
it's very different now compared to the

5738.88 --> 5742.900000000001
Medieval Times

5741.159 --> 5746.32
of course now

5742.9 --> 5748.719
people don't become suppressed by being

5746.32 --> 5749.86
starved they become suppressed by being

5748.719 --> 5752.38
drugged

5749.86 --> 5754.9
because there is really no actual

5752.38 --> 5756.1
starvation like there was in medieval

5754.9 --> 5760.62
times

5756.1 --> 5760.620000000001
too many ways to make and get food

5760.84 --> 5765.52
right so you can't really suppress

5762.699 --> 5767.759999999999
people like that it doesn't work and

5765.52 --> 5770.080000000001
really in reality when you take away

5767.76 --> 5771.9400000000005
some of the level of food that people

5770.08 --> 5773.0199999999995
are used to it's actually better for

5771.94 --> 5775.659
them

5773.02 --> 5777.580000000001
right because you don't need to stuff

5775.659 --> 5780.04
yourself it's better to not constantly

5777.58 --> 5781.36
stuff yourself so on average except for

5780.04 --> 5785.26
those people that are already like

5781.36 --> 5786.94
really careful with their food

5785.26 --> 5790.179
taking some of it away would actually

5786.94 --> 5792.099999999999
wake people up right because food is

5790.179 --> 5794.86
also can be when you just stuff people

5792.1 --> 5797.1990000000005
with food that's not very healthy it's

5794.86 --> 5802.08
like a drug

5797.199 --> 5802.08
so now they drug people to suppress them

5802.6 --> 5809.9800000000005
and in medieval times they starve them

5805.179 --> 5812.32
they didn't have drugs available like on

5809.98 --> 5813.759999999999
a mass reducible scale in order to do

5812.32 --> 5815.92
any of that

5813.76 --> 5818.679
so they just said like okay then you

5815.92 --> 5820.78
just have less food so you can spend all

5818.679 --> 5823.659
your time worrying about how to get by

5820.78 --> 5826.62
with that little food you still get

5823.659 --> 5829.719
instead of planning or

5826.62 --> 5832.54
bodybuilding yourself to to overthrow me

5829.719 --> 5834.28
or my soldiers right it's a different

5832.54 --> 5836.98
approach but it's basically the same

5834.28 --> 5838.96
thing suppression not through starvation

5836.98 --> 5842.159
but through drugging

5838.96 --> 5842.159
that's what they do now

5847.179 --> 5854.5
right and on top of

5850.679 --> 5856.36
drugs and food and indulgences there's

5854.5 --> 5859.98
also delusion

5856.36 --> 5859.98
yeah delusion entertainment

5861.1 --> 5866.26
this is a great distraction and people

5863.139 --> 5867.76
it's like a good Storyteller is kind of

5866.26 --> 5870.04
valuable

5867.76 --> 5872.4400000000005
can keep up morale can keep people

5870.04 --> 5874.719
stable

5872.44 --> 5875.98
or get them out of a depression even

5874.719 --> 5877.4800000000005
like

5875.98 --> 5878.379999999999
because they're just so bored or

5877.48 --> 5881.32
whatever

5878.38 --> 5886.06
stories keep people busy so there is now

5881.32 --> 5888.759999999999
a storytelling industry on top of drugs

5886.06 --> 5891.6990000000005
am I even conjunct

5888.76 --> 5894.6990000000005
and then yeah

5891.699 --> 5898.9
you got people now they're all religious

5894.699 --> 5901.599999999999
Fanatics under partially under drugs

5898.9 --> 5904.12
feeding of delusions that have been

5901.6 --> 5907.54
created specifically so that they would

5904.12 --> 5910.0199999999995
become their own caretaker and prison

5907.54 --> 5910.0199999999995
keeper

5910.78 --> 5917.199
you're now locked into this religion of

5913.54 --> 5921.76
delusion that you need feed from from

5917.199 --> 5923.32
the top down who created it

5921.76 --> 5925.54
now you're stuck

5923.32 --> 5928.599999999999
the false belief

5925.54 --> 5930.76
probably partially drugged up

5928.6 --> 5933.400000000001
and even if you're like really clean

5930.76 --> 5935.92
well you're still drugged up under the

5933.4 --> 5937.239
delusion yeah doesn't matter if you

5935.92 --> 5939.42
don't take some kind of physical

5937.239 --> 5943.599999999999
substance information

5939.42 --> 5946.84
triggers drugs in your mind

5943.6 --> 5949.2390000000005
and you're loving this [ __ ] because it

5946.84 --> 5952.06
triggers very certain substances in your

5949.239 --> 5953.0199999999995
mind like engaging in delusion on that

5952.06 --> 5956.38
scope

5953.02 --> 5957.34
does something for you yeah yeah it's a

5956.38 --> 5961.54
drug

5957.34 --> 5964.42
you're a drug addict except for taking

5961.54 --> 5966.5199999999995
some substance like smoking or drinking

5964.42 --> 5968.4400000000005
or whatever

5966.52 --> 5970.540000000001
you're taking in information to

5968.44 --> 5974.339999999999
reinforce an illusion that makes you

5970.54 --> 5974.34
feel really special

5976.179 --> 5979.32
but it is a drug

5992.44 --> 5995.339999999999
wow

5996.78 --> 6002.46
molars are so

6000.02 --> 6006.620000000001
innocent need of defending their

6002.46 --> 6006.62
religion this today God

6012.08 --> 6019.139
liked yesterday better

6014.82 --> 6022.08
no Ballers around I'm sick of it

6019.139 --> 6024.179
but I guess with spring also pop up the

6022.08 --> 6026.159
Ballers they're also going to get that

6024.179 --> 6028.86
energy and of course the sirens calls

6026.159 --> 6031.08
immediately like sirens just calling to

6028.86 --> 6034.139
them like oh the energy is coming back

6031.08 --> 6036.98
quickly quickly now you can defend the

6034.139 --> 6039.4800000000005
globe more against us flat earthers oh

6036.98 --> 6041.5199999999995
yeah that's the siren calls of the

6039.48 --> 6044.04
baller oh quickly quickly you're getting

6041.52 --> 6047.159000000001
energy that means you have to spend more

6044.04 --> 6050.159
time and energy on social media

6047.159 --> 6052.759999999999
to try to stop the flat earthers yeah

6050.159 --> 6055.94
that's your Sirens call

6052.76 --> 6055.9400000000005
[ __ ] great

6059.1 --> 6062.0
what can you do

6074.52 --> 6077.52
what

6077.76 --> 6082.56
Flat Earth is not a religion dumbass

6082.86 --> 6087.54
has nothing to do with religion that's a

6085.679 --> 6090.719
direct insult

6087.54 --> 6093.06
there's nothing we talk about that we

6090.719 --> 6095.96
Flat Earth actual living Flat Earth

6093.06 --> 6099.3
there's that talk and share their ideas

6095.96 --> 6102.2390000000005
there's nothing that comes rolling out

6099.3 --> 6106.34
of us that is religious

6102.239 --> 6106.339999999999
has nothing to do with religion

6108.06 --> 6115.5
I'm tired of the [ __ ] straw man

6111.42 --> 6119.159
nonsense about flat earthers

6115.5 --> 6122.34
there is no religion has nothing to do

6119.159 --> 6125.759999999999
with religion or belief

6122.34 --> 6128.46
now people may have beliefs

6125.76 --> 6130.26
that are on top of the Flat Earth though

6128.46 --> 6132.119
that's their own problem it has nothing

6130.26 --> 6135.179
to do with flat Earth though yeah people

6132.119 --> 6137.159
have belief yeah you get it people

6135.179 --> 6140.34
human being

6137.159 --> 6142.82
have beliefs that has nothing to do with

6140.34 --> 6142.82
flat Earth

6144.9 --> 6149.54
it's like saying

6146.71 --> 6152.52
[Music]

6149.54 --> 6155.159
biologists have beliefs

6152.52 --> 6157.8
yeah but it has nothing to do though

6155.159 --> 6160.92
with it biology is just a discipline

6157.8 --> 6163.4400000000005
it's a feel of research and a scientific

6160.92 --> 6164.52
discipline on top right

6163.44 --> 6167.638999999999
that

6164.52 --> 6169.02
has nothing to do with beliefs it's not

6167.639 --> 6173.1
important

6169.02 --> 6175.4400000000005
right including the supposed Theory

6173.1 --> 6178.08
of evolution which is a belief there's

6175.44 --> 6179.58
no proof for it really but they

6178.08 --> 6183.719
classified in there so yeah the

6179.58 --> 6186.179
biologist may have a belief of evolution

6183.719 --> 6190.1
but that has nothing to do with Biology

6186.179 --> 6190.1
because it's not proven

6190.67 --> 6193.779
[Music]

6197.63 --> 6200.729
[Music]

6204.5 --> 6211.8
shut up what where I'm so [ __ ] sick

6208.32 --> 6214.44
do you name arguments that's all you

6211.8 --> 6216.6
ever say who could you name the art we

6214.44 --> 6218.58
are naming the arguments I'm naming the

6216.6 --> 6220.8
arguments the people in the chat are

6218.58 --> 6224.159
naming the argument I'm [ __ ] sick of

6220.8 --> 6226.4400000000005
bald cards whining about what are the

6224.159 --> 6230.58
arguments we're literally saying them to

6226.44 --> 6233.099999999999
you continually you stupid [ __ ]

6230.58 --> 6235.26
continually

6233.1 --> 6238.26
we tell you

6235.26 --> 6240.7390000000005
and you ask oh what are the reasons [ __ ]

6238.26 --> 6240.7390000000005
you dude

6242.82 --> 6245.719
ah

6255.55 --> 6258.68
[Music]

6261.659 --> 6265.08
maybe my actual gun is starting to wear

6263.82 --> 6267.78
off

6265.08 --> 6269.96
no probably not I'm just getting sick of

6267.78 --> 6269.96
it

6274.98 --> 6281.879999999999
so sick of seeing the same thing over

6277.26 --> 6284.900000000001
again it's just a full neurotic display

6281.88 --> 6284.900000000001
I mean I could

6285.54 --> 6293.179
ah no I'm not gonna go there it's just

6288.06 --> 6293.179
that yeah I can fully simulate a baller

6296.46 --> 6301.9800000000005
I just don't even want to anymore it's

6298.26 --> 6304.46
just such a clearly defined form of

6301.98 --> 6308.04
insanity

6304.46 --> 6310.8
so Crystal clearly defined

6308.04 --> 6314.76
what it is how it works what people do

6310.8 --> 6318.42
why they do it what's next

6314.76 --> 6321.3
like if I can just identify every single

6318.42 --> 6323.6990000000005
aspect of it even the unspoken

6321.3 --> 6326.88
descriptions

6323.699 --> 6330.9
and and still it just keeps happening it

6326.88 --> 6334.56
just people keep doing it I I so [ __ ]

6330.9 --> 6337.5599999999995
sick of this madness I'm so sick of it

6334.56 --> 6339.900000000001
being out there obstructing people I'm

6337.56 --> 6343.04
so [ __ ] sick of the [ __ ] ball dude

6339.9 --> 6343.04
I'm so sick of it

6345.6 --> 6352.08
it's not even the ball it's to say I'm

6348.659 --> 6354.719
sick of the ball is a straw man

6352.08 --> 6356.76
to be fair it's actually a straw man

6354.719 --> 6359.82
because I'm not sick of the ball I'm

6356.76 --> 6363.179
sick of these stupid [ __ ] [ __ ]

6359.82 --> 6367.139
people and they're delusional [ __ ]

6363.179 --> 6370.5
dedication I'm so sick of that

6367.139 --> 6374.159000000001
the delusional dedication

6370.5 --> 6375.9
I'm so sick of it I'm not even sick of

6374.159 --> 6379.739
the ball I think it's a great piece of

6375.9 --> 6381.96
art it's great it's awesome it's fake it

6379.739 --> 6384.239
is great piece of art I love it yeah I'm

6381.96 --> 6386.76
not sick of the ball how dare I say that

6384.239 --> 6390.48
I'm not [ __ ] sick off the ball I'm

6386.76 --> 6394.88
sick of ball Tarts and they're

6390.48 --> 6394.879999999999
Eternal dedication to their delusion

6406.76 --> 6411.08
hey Crockett good to see you

6412.639 --> 6415.639
uh

6415.94 --> 6419.78
all right be right back

6452.4 --> 6455.4
foreign

6506.9 --> 6514.339999999999
oh man

6509.659 --> 6514.339999999999
wow time has flown like crazy

6536.76 --> 6539.6
foreign

6545.76 --> 6553.04
you can [ __ ] off now

6547.98 --> 6553.04
I don't need you ball Target here

6555.179 --> 6560.58
even though there are people here that

6557.699 --> 6564.739
are ballers that have wrenches

6560.58 --> 6564.739
they know when to shut the [ __ ] up

6580.139 --> 6585.78
thank you

6582.38 --> 6588.42
adopting my policy request am I I don't

6585.78 --> 6591.3
know if I am I'm just

6588.42 --> 6595.139
you know sometimes somebody can be very

6591.3 --> 6598.02
stubborn you have no proof for the Flat

6595.139 --> 6601.32
Earth or something it's one thing right

6598.02 --> 6605.820000000001
it's annoying but it's like okay so

6601.32 --> 6608.94
but but then if that just turns into a

6605.82 --> 6612.42
forced back and forth and an endless

6608.94 --> 6615.239
dragging out and then forcing me to

6612.42 --> 6617.639
basically like a [ __ ] robot roll out

6615.239 --> 6621.959999999999
my entire curriculum

6617.639 --> 6625.1990000000005
just because some [ __ ] in the moment

6621.96 --> 6627.6
doesn't have the faculties to actually

6625.199 --> 6631.5
remember anything themselves or whatever

6627.6 --> 6633.7390000000005
I'm so sick of that dude I'm so sick of

6631.5 --> 6633.739
that

6633.78 --> 6637.94
I'm you're just [ __ ]

6640.02 --> 6646.080000000001
there's people that watch my show that

6643.199 --> 6650.879999999999
when the first time they speak up

6646.08 --> 6653.5199999999995
they can just explain back to me exactly

6650.88 --> 6655.86
what I mean

6653.52 --> 6657.0
without me explaining it to them first

6655.86 --> 6659.339999999999
okay

6657.0 --> 6662.88
those are people that have just never

6659.34 --> 6665.9400000000005
even spoken up before okay those people

6662.88 --> 6668.9400000000005
are the counter opposite of ball tards

6665.94 --> 6671.28
yeah ball Tarts they blabber all the way

6668.94 --> 6673.86
and then they just don't know anything

6671.28 --> 6676.04
but yapping

6673.86 --> 6676.04
thank you

6681.84 --> 6687.9800000000005
just shut the [ __ ] up and listen and

6686.639 --> 6692.639
learn

6687.98 --> 6698.04
absorb the information to a degree where

6692.639 --> 6701.04
you can repeat it back and reason

6698.04 --> 6701.04
utilizing

6706.32 --> 6709.04
I've dropped

6710.699 --> 6716.4
and I when I get really early and then

6714.36 --> 6719.78
it's like very tough to hold back the

6716.4 --> 6719.78
F-bomb sorry about that

6720.0 --> 6723.96
like I don't mean to I don't I don't

6722.699 --> 6726.119
like it

6723.96 --> 6728.58
I don't like to listen back to my own

6726.119 --> 6730.44
show and hearing myself use the F-bomb

6728.58 --> 6732.659
all the time

6730.44 --> 6735.0
even for just that

6732.659 --> 6737.659
seems like my internet is screwing

6735.0 --> 6737.659
around with me

6883.44 --> 6886.44
God

6887.76 --> 6893.119000000001
damn it

6889.76 --> 6893.119000000001
[ __ ] sound

6896.04 --> 6901.94
right so everything is getting cut up

6899.159 --> 6901.94
probably

6902.88 --> 6907.7390000000005
so I'm just rounding out and the round

6905.58 --> 6910.5
out might also be cut up in the end this

6907.739 --> 6913.138999999999
happened to like a week ago in the show

6910.5 --> 6915.239
and then just everything got cut like it

6913.139 --> 6916.82
went through a blender or something it

6915.239 --> 6919.138999999999
was completely

6916.82 --> 6921.719
unintelligible because of that

6919.139 --> 6925.02

6921.719 --> 6927.2390000000005
