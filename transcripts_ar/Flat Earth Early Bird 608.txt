rob h yeah good to see you all

247.12 --> 252.0

slow

252.84 --> 259.519
ugh

254.959 --> 263.28000000000003
because of the heat and i think i yeah i

[Music]

280.479 --> 288.24
it was yeah it was pretty good

283.52 --> 290.56
yes 608 shows that's right x20

288.24 --> 290.56
no

294.84 --> 301.19899999999996
um what's

297.6 --> 304.56
even about it's the usual

301.199 --> 307.759
um all right

304.56 --> 310.4
and yeah later i think it started really

307.759 --> 312.08000000000004
late this time remember correctly but

310.4 --> 315.12
own benjamin was on

312.08 --> 316.56
with urban farmer i think that that was

315.12 --> 320.479
his name

316.56 --> 323.44
and yeah

320.479 --> 324.08
it was a really good show and that guy

323.44 --> 328.08
was very

324.08 --> 331.12
interesting that's some great ideas

328.08 --> 331.68
and he was very clear to it was clear to

331.12 --> 335.199
me

331.68 --> 337.44
that he was indeed a dnd player

335.199 --> 339.28000000000003
and probably also a game master and that

337.44 --> 341.84
really showed

339.28 --> 342.4
so yeah i had that was very interesting

341.84 --> 345.59999999999997
uh

342.4 --> 347.52
to hear him out and yeah it was overall

345.6 --> 353.24
pretty epic show

347.52 --> 356.4
and yeah especially concerning

353.24 --> 356.88
synchronicities in this year and how

356.4 --> 359.52
that

356.88 --> 359.52
unrolls

360.0 --> 367.84
uh are all d20 ballers

368.24 --> 383.84000000000003
let me look up a word it was in my mind

380.88 --> 386.08
did i my sound still there right yeah i

383.84 --> 395.84
heard something disconnect but i can't

386.08 --> 395.84
pinpoint what that was weird

400.8 --> 406.84000000000003
right yeah i was just considering a word

404.24 --> 409.12
uh in opposition to all the uh

406.84 --> 410.71999999999997
synchronicities that we basically call

409.12 --> 414.479
it like this

410.72 --> 416.88000000000005
these weird parallels and everything

414.479 --> 418.71999999999997
that you bump into typically when well

416.88 --> 419.759
it is said that that happens when you're

418.72 --> 421.52000000000004
doing

419.759 --> 423.759
when you're on the right track that's

421.52 --> 426.639
like a sign

423.759 --> 429.599
right and then we call it synchronicity

426.639 --> 432.40000000000003
so far it's what it kind of i call it

429.599 --> 434.4
it's an interesting word too but is it

432.4 --> 438.08
just kismet

434.4 --> 440.4
which is more destiny or fate

438.08 --> 440.4
is it

441.12 --> 446.5
i don't know just words going through my

444.16 --> 448.88000000000005
mind i don't know

446.5 --> 451.36
[Music]

448.88 --> 454.639
i'm not uh i'm afraid i'm not all that

451.36 --> 454.639
insightful this morning

460.4 --> 468.31899999999996
all right

464.879 --> 470.639
synchronicities anyway

468.319 --> 470.639
um

472.639 --> 479.84000000000003
oh i haven't even opened skype yet huh

480.319 --> 483.03900000000004
oh nothing

485.12 --> 489.36
oh yeah there was an iron rail media

487.599 --> 491.36
live this morning

489.36 --> 493.12
but i kind of missed it i opened it up

491.36 --> 496.47900000000004
then went for groceries

493.12 --> 499.52
then when i got back it was over oh yeah

496.479 --> 503.28
sleeping warrior uploaded a fun little

499.52 --> 504.639
little video mr miyagi explaining to

503.28 --> 508.23999999999995
daniel

504.639 --> 510.639
about the coriolis effect it was funny

508.24 --> 510.639
silly

514.88 --> 519.279
oh yeah i think i missed out on bible

517.519 --> 522.159
literalist i think i popped by there and

519.279 --> 522.159
then missed the rest

522.32 --> 525.279
yesterday evening

530.72 --> 535.839
what was that

538.399 --> 543.839
hey hmm

541.76 --> 546.56
oh i didn't see that one i hadn't i

543.839 --> 550.8000000000001
missed this the good servant apparently

546.56 --> 550.8
that was yesterday in the day even

550.88 --> 553.92
like somewhere after the debates he did

552.8 --> 557.92
a raw talk

553.92 --> 560.56
with martin stolberg hmm

557.92 --> 561.12
i wish i could have watched that that

560.56 --> 563.8389999999999
yeah

561.12 --> 563.839
i'm curious

564.959 --> 570.0799999999999
because he is a guy that is in my chat

567.279 --> 570.08
more recently

572.0 --> 577.839
so i wonder what you guys talked about

586.48 --> 591.839
what are you talking about pesky judges

600.24 --> 605.839
he stats moretz by the way

608.64 --> 619.8389999999999
flat earth bible and mad ks

613.12 --> 619.839
what does that mean

622.63 --> 625.779
[Music]

630.399 --> 633.839
oh masks right

637.47 --> 640.679
[Music]

664.88 --> 668.959
tom parker was with you guys too okay

670.56 --> 676.959
anyway yeah you know maybe i i will uh

674.16 --> 676.959
somewhere today

677.44 --> 681.44
already went out for groceries so i'll

679.76 --> 689.8389999999999
uh

681.44 --> 689.839
i'll see if i can watch it

694.56 --> 701.68
oh okay yeah martin tolberg's

697.68 --> 703.76
is a baller after all but he says there

701.68 --> 705.4399999999999
is some space footage that cannot be

703.76 --> 708.88
discarded as faked so

705.44 --> 711.2
can you be more specific about that

708.88 --> 713.279
because hey if you're gonna if you're

711.2 --> 716.9590000000001
gonna make statements like that

713.279 --> 719.12
in a place like this indirect associated

716.959 --> 721.76
association in cooperation with the flat

719.12 --> 721.76
earth debates

721.839 --> 727.519
yeah you should know what you're gonna

723.519 --> 727.519
expect so can you present this

729.12 --> 735.2
this footage that cannot be discarded as

733.6 --> 739.839
faked according to you

735.2 --> 739.839
martin tolberg martin stallbergs

741.839 --> 745.839
he's like clean

749.519 --> 753.36
uh that

753.839 --> 759.839
i don't know what that means good

756.839 --> 759.839
servant

760.8 --> 765.4399999999999
you know just because somebody refuses

763.6 --> 768.5600000000001
to

765.44 --> 771.36
take at an associated title

768.56 --> 773.04
oh right on the fence a gleam is on the

771.36 --> 773.76
fence really he's on the fence about the

773.04 --> 777.1999999999999
globe

773.76 --> 780.72
can't be serious look if he's

777.2 --> 783.44
a cosmogonical uh

780.72 --> 784.399
agnostic that's one thing you know like

783.44 --> 786.48
okay i don't

784.399 --> 788.16
want to make up my mind about what it

786.48 --> 791.2
could be

788.16 --> 794.88
because i'm not sure and that's honest

791.2 --> 797.519
but that's

794.88 --> 798.079
like undefense is really that you're not

797.519 --> 800.399
sure

798.079 --> 802.2399999999999
yet and if you're in such a position

800.399 --> 803.6
then it's very unlikely that you're

802.24 --> 806.48
going to

803.6 --> 809.44
have very specific ideas that's

806.48 --> 813.04
typically on the fence

809.44 --> 815.839
what he's buying what does that mean

813.04 --> 815.8389999999999
good servant

826.839 --> 829.839
man

833.36 --> 837.839
yeah i need the the lift i know what it

836.959 --> 843.8389999999999
is maybe i need

837.839 --> 843.839
my my blood pressure up a little

848.399 --> 857.839
two models what does that mean

858.639 --> 863.76
we'll have to search for that then yeah

861.44 --> 866.32
martin tolberg that's

863.76 --> 868.8389999999999
i i yeah you would have to do that if

866.32 --> 872.0
you're going to make a claim

868.839 --> 874.24
about such footage to

872.0 --> 876.079
exist and it's actually good to actually

874.24 --> 877.44
have that footage because yeah i can

876.079 --> 880.56
imagine

877.44 --> 881.0400000000001
all kinds of things to be there that

880.56 --> 884.4799999999999
would

881.04 --> 886.399
potentially laid out

884.48 --> 888.48
that maybe the ball might be real after

886.399 --> 891.279
yeah but the thing about those

888.48 --> 892.5600000000001
conceptions that i can make is their

891.279 --> 899.8389999999999
conceptions they're not

892.56 --> 899.8389999999999
actually there that's the point

910.839 --> 913.839
ah

920.639 --> 927.839
i do not know the shape but is there

922.959 --> 927.8389999999999
nothing you know about it

933.279 --> 939.04
you know the we don't know the entire

936.0 --> 941.36
layout of the realm especially

939.04 --> 943.36
beyond a certain point and yet

941.36 --> 944.24
technically the imagination could go

943.36 --> 947.12
wild and

944.24 --> 947.12
even draw in

948.0 --> 953.92
very abnormal types of

951.36 --> 956.16
and visualizations including an edge

953.92 --> 959.36
over which the sea

956.16 --> 960.959
falls down and then who knows what

959.36 --> 962.24
how things are supposed to be working

960.959 --> 963.7589999999999
over there or maybe there is like

962.24 --> 967.04
freaking corners

963.759 --> 969.6800000000001
it's totally freaky in the mind

967.04 --> 971.199
and therefore yeah we definitely don't

969.68 --> 974.079
see any of that here but

971.199 --> 975.3599999999999
yeah we don't know beyond a certain

974.079 --> 978.7199999999999
point

975.36 --> 981.6
and we can only go by the

978.72 --> 982.32
the standards of what we normally bump

981.6 --> 996.72
into

982.32 --> 1001.6
and natural law and a scientific method

996.72 --> 1004.639
but yeah so far just with optics

1001.6 --> 1007.0400000000001
there yeah the earth is definitely not

1004.639 --> 1009.199
the baldness of the size they say it is

1007.04 --> 1011.04
which it would have to be or everything

1009.199 --> 1012.16
that they've basically conceived and

1011.04 --> 1014.7199999999999
presented

1012.16 --> 1016.24
would be completely invalid well that is

1014.72 --> 1019.519
part of the point of what

1016.24 --> 1019.519
flat earthers are doing

1021.04 --> 1025.839
is that hectic

1027.039 --> 1030.559
all right yeah you could call it

1028.319 --> 1033.6
synthetics

1030.559 --> 1037.76
but i call it cosmogeny because that

1033.6 --> 1040.079
literally just entails everything

1037.76 --> 1041.52
including in this case the other

1040.079 --> 1045.28
dimensions

1041.52 --> 1048.96
which i have grafted in

1045.28 --> 1050.48
in yeah into a as a possibility into the

1048.96 --> 1054.0
system

1050.48 --> 1058.48
explain weird things but it's not the

1054.0 --> 1061.28
the dimensions that yeah correlate to

1058.48 --> 1067.84
what's been conceived within mathematics

1061.28 --> 1067.84
it's nothing like that

1069.919 --> 1076.64
like it could be roughly compared but it

1073.28 --> 1080.3999999999999
it's not literally there anyway

1076.64 --> 1081.679
uh but yeah there's no outer space

1080.4 --> 1084.5590000000002
there's not a

1081.679 --> 1086.16
like insane amount of room up there

1084.559 --> 1089.9189999999999
somewhere

1086.16 --> 1089.919
with entire other places

1090.88 --> 1095.8400000000001
and that is a big cornerstone of my

1093.6 --> 1098.8799999999999
cosmogeny

1095.84 --> 1099.28
that that's not there physically now

1098.88 --> 1102.7990000000002
what

1099.28 --> 1105.6
spiritually in some way may exist

1102.799 --> 1106.0
yeah now there is a lot of room there

1105.6 --> 1109.6789999999999
like

1106.0 --> 1113.039
i've considered that in ways spiritually

1109.679 --> 1113.039
there is infinite room

1113.679 --> 1120.88
but probably not without consequences

1118.72 --> 1123.84
but physically there seems to be a

1120.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
limited amount of room

1126.48 --> 1132.16
and it would have to be or

1130.08 --> 1134.96
yeah the physics of the place wouldn't

1132.16 --> 1134.96
make any sense

1135.52 --> 1139.76
like it has to be limited can't be

1137.919 --> 1144.0800000000002
infinite

1139.76 --> 1144.08
infinity is a physical impossibility

1144.72 --> 1151.039
but spiritually yeah

1147.76 --> 1152.0
it seems kind of limitless but still

1151.039 --> 1155.44
yeah it's bound

1152.0 --> 1158.48
you know as even spiritual experiences

1155.44 --> 1161.8400000000001
are engaged from

1158.48 --> 1165.679
from within a a setup where we

1161.84 --> 1167.76
as spirits are tied in with our bodies

1165.679 --> 1168.88
so there is still the physical

1167.76 --> 1171.2
limitation

1168.88 --> 1173.2800000000002
of our bodies is what limits the

1171.2 --> 1176.16
spiritual

1173.28 --> 1177.12
but mechanically it seems spiritually

1176.16 --> 1180.88
there is

1177.12 --> 1184.6399999999999
there is a potential infinity

1180.88 --> 1184.64
physically it doesn't seem to be there

1189.47 --> 1193.84
[Music]

1190.84 --> 1193.84
anyway

1204.84 --> 1209.76
hmm

1207.6 --> 1212.0
but uh yeah back to this to what i was

1209.76 --> 1212.0
saying

1212.72 --> 1214.96
like

1216.32 --> 1223.4399999999998
if the earth is simply considered

1220.32 --> 1224.3999999999999
flat which means the geometrical

1223.44 --> 1227.919
orientation

1224.4 --> 1230.5590000000002
of the interlinking earth

1227.919 --> 1231.44
surfaces including the water in the

1230.559 --> 1235.039
oceans

1231.44 --> 1236.559
not the the the the geometrical

1235.039 --> 1239.6
orientation of it all

1236.559 --> 1244.6399999999999
of that the surface the surface average

1239.6 --> 1246.6399999999999
as it were is flat geometrically

1244.64 --> 1248.72
and yeah there's only so many things

1246.64 --> 1252.5590000000002
that can be

1248.72 --> 1254.4
shaped out of that potentially

1252.559 --> 1257.28
so yeah you could imagine that in some

1254.4 --> 1260.5590000000002
way it might be some gigantic ball

1257.28 --> 1262.96
but design wise that really wouldn't

1260.559 --> 1266.1589999999999
make any damn sense

1262.96 --> 1267.52
like none at all especially with the

1266.159 --> 1271.6000000000001
celestial

1267.52 --> 1277.28
systems it makes no damn sense if

1271.6 --> 1280.1589999999999
yeah the earth was a jupiter-sized ball

1277.28 --> 1282.72
based on the yeah on the heliocentric

1280.159 --> 1285.7600000000002
legend of the giant size of jupiter

1282.72 --> 1285.76
presupposed size

1287.84 --> 1292.32
so yeah but if it's flat that's not the

1291.039 --> 1294.4
end of it

1292.32 --> 1295.9189999999999
that doesn't mean that oh we are just

1294.4 --> 1299.76
limited to this bubble

1295.919 --> 1299.76
with a flat surface within it

1302.84 --> 1308.6399999999999
because yeah

1305.44 --> 1310.64
however large the confine is dependent

1308.64 --> 1314.0
on the nature of its orientation

1310.64 --> 1314.96
in a potential built-in loop or multiple

1314.0 --> 1318.88
loops

1314.96 --> 1321.76
it could have

1318.88 --> 1321.7600000000002
all kinds of

1323.2 --> 1330.4
room that's not maybe even so

1326.799 --> 1333.52
readily available at first glance

1330.4 --> 1336.88
there may be all kinds of space but

1333.52 --> 1337.6
the total the totality of the space

1336.88 --> 1341.2800000000002
available

1337.6 --> 1341.28
will always be limited

1342.24 --> 1350.48
but it could be a lot and it could be

1347.12 --> 1353.36
in any unexpected places even unexpected

1350.48 --> 1353.3600000000001
ways to get there

1353.52 --> 1357.52
but there is a limit to the the total

1355.76 --> 1361.84
amount of it

1357.52 --> 1361.84
absolutely anyway

1374.96 --> 1381.9
[Music]

1400.84 --> 1403.84
um

1414.84 --> 1419.76
uh

1417.76 --> 1422.08
yeah over offset like what are you

1419.76 --> 1422.08
saying

1423.039 --> 1428.48
that that doesn't seem normal english to

1428.84 --> 1431.84
me

1463.6 --> 1474.32
oh goody martin taller

1472.559 --> 1477.12
what kind of show are you watching i've

1474.32 --> 1477.12
never heard of that

1478.4 --> 1487.8400000000001
rip on rabbit holes

1481.76 --> 1487.84
is that a youtube channel

1512.84 --> 1515.84
hmm

1538.32 --> 1544.48
hmm all right you also had a flat earth

1542.32 --> 1546.3999999999999
i'm looking through his list and he also

1544.48 --> 1550.72
had david weiss on

1546.4 --> 1550.72
a week ago it seems hmm

1553.12 --> 1557.84
okay well maybe i'll check it out

1560.64 --> 1567.44
one hour 40. right

1563.84 --> 1571.84
now we'll see man that guy is

1567.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
over a million subscribers that's crazy

1580.32 --> 1585.6789999999999
right so this is the video he's talking

1582.48 --> 1599.84
about that he watched

1585.679 --> 1599.8400000000001
from ripon rabbit hole

1604.08 --> 1609.6789999999999
the weather wildlife lecture of altitude

1606.799 --> 1609.679
temperature what

1611.84 --> 1627.84
guards the edge

1628.64 --> 1633.1200000000001
good servant come on man check your

1630.72 --> 1633.1200000000001
spelling

1634.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
don't be too eager to enter

1638.32 --> 1641.84
keep doing this

1666.08 --> 1670.799
well a peter stone uh maybe

1671.279 --> 1678.0
like why are you straw manning

1674.84 --> 1680.32
orochimaru with an

1678.0 --> 1680.32
edge

1681.2 --> 1685.2
hold water in like what

1687.679 --> 1691.76
it seems like you're projecting this

1689.52 --> 1693.44
idea onto him

1691.76 --> 1695.6
because i don't think he ever brought it

1693.44 --> 1710.559
up maybe is a joke

1695.6 --> 1712.8799999999999
but so far not so much

1710.559 --> 1712.8799999999999
really

1717.12 --> 1723.84
okay that that is what you said

1720.799 --> 1726.32
right so do you believe that that that

1723.84 --> 1726.32
is true

1729.279 --> 1734.24
why why the hell would you believe that

1736.64 --> 1743.6000000000001
yeah i guess i was wrong peter stone but

1739.12 --> 1743.6
it is typical straw man situation so

1751.2 --> 1755.3600000000001
that what is that belief based on it's

1754.159 --> 1757.279
just an idea that

1755.36 --> 1758.9599999999998
popped in your head one day and you've

1757.279 --> 1761.84
always kept

1758.96 --> 1764.64
hanging on to that ever tried to make

1761.84 --> 1768.08
any sense of it

1764.64 --> 1771.76
oh it's a circle a circle

1768.08 --> 1773.9189999999999
right does that sir what does that mean

1771.76 --> 1776.1589999999999
you know talk about it many times circle

1773.919 --> 1777.8400000000001
yeah bible i know a circle the circle of

1776.159 --> 1781.8400000000001
the earth right the circle

1777.84 --> 1781.84
so what does that mean what is a circle

1782.32 --> 1788.6399999999999
a circle is

1785.36 --> 1791.36
it's not a spatial thing it's a path

1788.64 --> 1793.679
it's a pathway that's what a circle

1791.36 --> 1796.9599999999998
means it doesn't mean anything about

1793.679 --> 1799.8400000000001
shapes it's a circle

1796.96 --> 1800.32
so why are you deriving from that that

1799.84 --> 1804.0
means

1800.32 --> 1807.279
the earth is a

1804.0 --> 1810.48
disc with upturned edges as a circle

1807.279 --> 1812.88
in the middle of nothing open

1810.48 --> 1812.88
room

1814.08 --> 1820.6399999999999
like what are you saying that

1817.919 --> 1822.64
it is at an edge and there's like a a

1820.64 --> 1825.679
drop and then there's the bottom

1822.64 --> 1825.679
or something what what

1829.44 --> 1832.64
yeah i know peter stone a circle is a

1831.84 --> 1837.84
geometric

1832.64 --> 1837.8400000000001
shape but it's not a 3d shape

1840.399 --> 1847.039
it's an aspect so yeah technically

1843.84 --> 1849.6
a circle can be considered a geom within

1847.039 --> 1852.08
geometry yeah it is a shape

1849.6 --> 1854.0
but within actual physical reality it's

1852.08 --> 1858.08
not a shape

1854.0 --> 1865.84
it's an aspect it's a it's a thing

1858.08 --> 1865.84
it doesn't point at the direct shape

1876.64 --> 1880.48
yeah exactly again within geometry those

1879.44 --> 1883.519
are technically

1880.48 --> 1884.0
shapes in the physical reality there has

1883.519 --> 1888.08
to be

1884.0 --> 1889.679
a 3d component now you can say yeah it

1888.08 --> 1894.0
has those

1889.679 --> 1896.159
geometrical aspects at its core

1894.0 --> 1896.159
but

1899.2 --> 1906.72
a 3d circle is a sphere oh yeah

1903.279 --> 1910.88
of course not so though because

1906.72 --> 1910.88
yeah it can also be considered a disc

1910.96 --> 1913.8400000000001
or hey

1914.24 --> 1922.24
it's a circle right so yeah could i

1917.44 --> 1924.0800000000002
consider a circle to be a looping space

1922.24 --> 1926.559
it's like a circle right yeah i know

1924.08 --> 1929.519
it's straight line

1926.559 --> 1932.799
but it's still looping in on itself just

1929.519 --> 1949.84
like a circle so do you think that maybe

1932.799 --> 1949.84
that was the hint that was pointed at

1959.039 --> 1963.84
all right

1981.44 --> 1984.48
look at that point it really does sound

1983.6 --> 1987.36
like

1984.48 --> 1987.679
divine technobabble to me because it's

1987.36 --> 1991.279
not

1987.679 --> 1994.72
being very specific as to what is done

1991.279 --> 1999.2
these are descriptive actions

1994.72 --> 2002.96
and like teaching moments as to

1999.2 --> 2003.519
certain facts as it were but it doesn't

2002.96 --> 2006.72
really

2003.519 --> 2010.64
describe a mechanical process

2006.72 --> 2011.039
so yeah that's always been my issue with

2010.64 --> 2016.48
that

2011.039 --> 2016.48
it's that it's not it's not enough

2016.84 --> 2019.84
information

2030.88 --> 2038.0800000000002
yeah you know even if you're gonna say

2034.399 --> 2039.5189999999998
earth is set on foundations okay

2038.08 --> 2041.76
well we know this thing about

2039.519 --> 2044.96
foundations and that is

2041.76 --> 2047.6
they are on something else so yeah what

2044.96 --> 2050.48
are these foundations on

2047.6 --> 2051.679
you know it's just hanging in there or

2050.48 --> 2056.2400000000002
could it simply be

2051.679 --> 2058.8
sitting on the end of spatiality itself

2056.24 --> 2059.359
in the vertical sense downward is there

2058.8 --> 2063.04
just an

2059.359 --> 2063.52
end point where things can simply not

2063.04 --> 2066.0
move

2063.52 --> 2066.0
beyond

2067.04 --> 2069.7599999999998
almost like a

2070.079 --> 2075.9190000000003
immutable glass floor

2074.0 --> 2077.679
like there's just going to be black

2075.919 --> 2079.44
under there and maybe you could shine

2077.679 --> 2082.8
light beyond

2079.44 --> 2089.839
but no matter can go beyond you can't

2082.8 --> 2089.8390000000004
even scratch it

2094.96 --> 2099.76
maybe that's where it's resting on you

2100.839 --> 2104.56
know

2102.16 --> 2104.56
anyway

2106.72 --> 2114.839
the firmament is it

2111.04 --> 2117.839
is solid it holds the water from heaven

2114.839 --> 2117.839
in

2118.88 --> 2121.119
what

2122.48 --> 2131.839
it holds it in or it keeps it out

2126.32 --> 2131.839
that what

2139.92 --> 2143.92
where are your dimensions you are

2141.68 --> 2146.3999999999996
imagining earlier then they're through

2143.92 --> 2146.4
they're not

2146.96 --> 2150.64
yeah they're they're not part of the

2149.119 --> 2153.119
physical

2150.64 --> 2153.1189999999997
space

2154.16 --> 2159.839
they're through

2162.46 --> 2165.63
[Music]

2177.119 --> 2180.599
a window of heaven open and close yeah

2179.28 --> 2184.8390000000004
that's really cute

2180.599 --> 2187.839
orochimaru but that could mean

2184.839 --> 2187.839
anything

2203.04 --> 2208.0
and besides like if you're gonna assume

2206.16 --> 2211.04
that that there's literally

2208.0 --> 2213.44
yes material from outside

2211.04 --> 2216.0
getting within the container that means

2213.44 --> 2218.96
there's going to be significant

2216.0 --> 2219.28
alteration of the entire pressure system

2218.96 --> 2221.359
like

2219.28 --> 2223.0400000000004
it's it's it's a closed pressure system

2221.359 --> 2225.5989999999997
so if there's going to be china

2223.04 --> 2227.04
if there's going to be an opening what

2225.599 --> 2228.96
does that even mean

2227.04 --> 2230.8
how much water would be out there what

2228.96 --> 2234.4
is the pressure of that all

2230.8 --> 2234.4
see there's implications

2235.04 --> 2240.32
it's a lot to take in if you

2238.56 --> 2242.24
really want to think about not saying

2240.32 --> 2244.56
that there's no that's all wrong

2242.24 --> 2246.72
it's just a lot more complicated than

2244.56 --> 2249.839
people probably even realize

2246.72 --> 2251.839
i think there is like a a living like

2249.839 --> 2254.96
the bubble

2251.839 --> 2256.16
with the yeah if if it is a bubble the

2254.96 --> 2258.079
energy shield

2256.16 --> 2260.72
where we're supposed to live and maybe

2258.079 --> 2263.92
everything outside of there

2260.72 --> 2267.839
is like the engineering

2263.92 --> 2270.88
maintenance space so maybe there is like

2267.839 --> 2272.48
a giant water reservoir specifically for

2270.88 --> 2274.4
that function

2272.48 --> 2276.56
that is not an infinite amount of water

2274.4 --> 2278.88
that surrounds the entire earth realm

2276.56 --> 2281.44
it's just a giant reservoir

2278.88 --> 2282.1600000000003
and there may even be just a plumbing

2281.44 --> 2284.56
system

2282.16 --> 2286.48
to the specific earth realm that we sit

2284.56 --> 2288.64
in that it could be flooded that it

2286.48 --> 2290.0
would go down and then recycle itself

2288.64 --> 2293.839
get back up there

2290.0 --> 2295.599
like a giant divine mechanism

2293.839 --> 2297.44
as part of the entire design of the

2295.599 --> 2300.4
realm that is

2297.44 --> 2301.68
laid outside of the normal physical

2300.4 --> 2305.599
confines that

2301.68 --> 2305.5989999999997
yeah living beings are allowed into

2310.56 --> 2314.72
and yeah then it kind of makes sense

2313.68 --> 2317.1189999999997
like

2314.72 --> 2317.1189999999997
remember

2318.48 --> 2321.76
the energy shield does not allow

2320.36 --> 2325.44
[Music]

2321.76 --> 2326.6400000000003
like penetration rapidly so things can

2325.44 --> 2330.48
get out

2326.64 --> 2333.5989999999997
but yeah if you just dump water onto it

2330.48 --> 2335.76
it might just go right through it

2333.599 --> 2337.04
so it's not holding back any water and

2335.76 --> 2339.92
open like a window

2337.04 --> 2340.32
no i think that just water may simply

2339.92 --> 2343.359
from

2340.32 --> 2346.96
much further than the energy barrier

2343.359 --> 2349.92
way out of sight maybe in a

2346.96 --> 2352.48
yeah in a god-sized container it could

2349.92 --> 2355.04
simply be opened mechanically

2352.48 --> 2357.76
and then water would just go right

2355.04 --> 2361.599
through these shields

2357.76 --> 2361.599
and yeah be dumped into the realm

2365.52 --> 2373.839
see yeah i'm just it's called reverse

2368.96 --> 2373.839
engineering on the spot just thinking

2380.839 --> 2383.839
logically

2394.839 --> 2397.839
hmm

2399.92 --> 2403.28
they show you rockets going through

2402.32 --> 2406.56
water and

2403.28 --> 2408.88
[ __ ] that's

2406.56 --> 2412.48
absolute nonsense here at sanford

2408.88 --> 2412.48
absolutely nonsense

2416.48 --> 2439.839
can't be serious

2424.24 --> 2439.839
sure you have

2439.92 --> 2443.119
now that doesn't make any sense george

2441.76 --> 2447.0400000000004
sanford think about it

2443.119 --> 2450.4
water does not float in solid state

2447.04 --> 2451.119
it's impossible literally impossible

2450.4 --> 2454.48
you're not

2451.119 --> 2454.48
thinking clearly about it

2457.119 --> 2460.2400000000002
and there's an energy field it's gonna

2459.119 --> 2463.839
bounce off first

2460.24 --> 2469.2
so it's just not it's not that

2463.839 --> 2469.2
it's not water there this is a myth

2475.68 --> 2481.1189999999997
yeah clouds do float that's right but

2478.88 --> 2482.2400000000002
that's because they're kind of diffused

2481.119 --> 2484.56
and they don't go

2482.24 --> 2486.7999999999997
up after a certain height and this is

2484.56 --> 2490.64
even revealed

2486.8 --> 2493.119
by high altitude balloon footage clouds

2490.64 --> 2495.1189999999997
only go up to a certain point because of

2493.119 --> 2497.76
the density of it

2495.119 --> 2498.56
there's not going to be water way on top

2497.76 --> 2501.8390000000004
of that

2498.56 --> 2502.319
makes no sense especially if it's going

2501.839 --> 2505.119
to be

2502.319 --> 2506.079
in solid form that it makes even less

2505.119 --> 2509.28
sense

2506.079 --> 2511.599
or in liquid form that you would be able

2509.28 --> 2512.079
to actually distinguish it as water that

2511.599 --> 2516.079
makes

2512.079 --> 2516.079
no freaking sense at all

2517.92 --> 2523.839
especially rockets are you serious

2524.4 --> 2528.56
this is all science fiction garbage

2532.319 --> 2537.52
right yes i've even

2535.599 --> 2539.6800000000003
speculated on this look if you're going

2537.52 --> 2541.28
to insist there's water up there

2539.68 --> 2542.72
yeah it's going to be freaking ice and

2541.28 --> 2546.0
it's going to be so cold

2542.72 --> 2548.0789999999997
it's going to be like an ice dome that's

2546.0 --> 2548.079
it

2549.04 --> 2553.7599999999998
no tiny bumble you're not gonna make a

2551.119 --> 2555.52
freaking baller out of me and don't

2553.76 --> 2557.6800000000003
don't go there or you're gonna get time

2555.52 --> 2557.68
out

2559.359 --> 2564.24
in the footage i have seen yeah yeah and

2561.68 --> 2566.64
where did that footage come from did you

2564.24 --> 2566.64
make it

2567.44 --> 2574.079
or was it handed down to you

2570.48 --> 2579.839
through a video that somebody showed

2574.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
like oh this is so real

2588.16 --> 2594.48
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

2591.68 --> 2594.48
george sanford

2594.64 --> 2597.7599999999998
it's unbelievable

2605.44 --> 2608.64
can't be serious man

2609.359 --> 2615.2
that the energy barrier whatever

2612.64 --> 2616.7999999999997
if there even is that is definitely

2615.2 --> 2618.56
first

2616.8 --> 2620.8
because things bump into it and there's

2618.56 --> 2624.16
no visual distortion

2620.8 --> 2627.6800000000003
to assume that there is

2624.16 --> 2635.839
liquid or ice just think about what

2627.68 --> 2635.839
you're saying man it makes no sense

2651.839 --> 2658.24
yay yeah libyan desert class very

2660.839 --> 2663.839
fascinating

2677.44 --> 2680.88
all right right right john that yeah

2679.599 --> 2684.4
sure yeah

2680.88 --> 2686.4
you know about libyan desert class

2684.4 --> 2688.079
though you know

2686.4 --> 2689.44
and this entire myth that that's

2688.079 --> 2691.76
supposed to be the firmament

2689.44 --> 2694.0
oh there's this thing about libyan

2691.76 --> 2698.8
desert glass

2694.0 --> 2702.88
it's only found in libya hello

2698.8 --> 2705.44
so is that where just

2702.88 --> 2706.88
the part of that glass dome just happens

2705.44 --> 2709.92
to keep on crumbling

2706.88 --> 2713.2000000000003
right there right above that

2709.92 --> 2716.0
so that all libyan glass

2713.2 --> 2717.2
falls down to the earth there alone

2716.0 --> 2720.64
right

2717.2 --> 2720.64
doesn't make a lot of sense to me

2722.4 --> 2725.599
i think there's another natural cause

2725.04 --> 2728.0
for that

2725.599 --> 2728.96
you know there's lightning strikes

2728.0 --> 2732.4
because

2728.96 --> 2735.119
like the pretty amazing glass

2732.4 --> 2737.28
desert roses for example i got some of

2735.119 --> 2737.28
that

2737.359 --> 2744.56
you know like this

2741.76 --> 2746.3190000000004
so yeah if it can do that i'm pretty

2744.56 --> 2747.7599999999998
sure there are other things that can

2746.319 --> 2751.119
happen

2747.76 --> 2753.44
i know that there's also meteoric

2751.119 --> 2754.1600000000003
glass whatever you want to call that

2753.44 --> 2757.76
right

2754.16 --> 2761.52
it's high energy impact

2757.76 --> 2764.7200000000003
uh apparently causes

2761.52 --> 2768.24
glass to form out of sand and all that

2764.72 --> 2770.56
and yeah with meteoric glass

2768.24 --> 2772.3999999999996
it's kind of rare but that exists that

2770.56 --> 2775.2
is really like glass

2772.4 --> 2776.56
so i think it's more likely that it's

2775.2 --> 2781.04
actually formed

2776.56 --> 2782.88
locally through certain events

2781.04 --> 2784.24
which i don't really understand how that

2782.88 --> 2785.76
even works you know

2784.24 --> 2788.0
because if there is going to be a

2785.76 --> 2790.3190000000004
physical object impacting then where

2788.0 --> 2792.72
is that actually coming from you know

2790.319 --> 2795.7599999999998
that's a much bigger mystery to me

2792.72 --> 2796.72
like supposed falling stars well little

2795.76 --> 2800.5600000000004
lights

2796.72 --> 2802.8799999999997
but yes rocks coming down

2800.56 --> 2817.839
where is that coming from now that's a

2802.88 --> 2817.839
bigger mystery to me

2836.16 --> 2841.839
that's right tiny wumbo yeah but just

2839.599 --> 2843.599
every time somebody brings up libyan

2841.839 --> 2845.04
glass

2843.599 --> 2847.839
and then says it's the dome it's the

2845.04 --> 2849.04
dummy i i always forget facepalm moments

2847.839 --> 2851.2
because

2849.04 --> 2852.16
dude why do you think it's called lamian

2851.2 --> 2855.2
glass

2852.16 --> 2856.48
because it's only found in libya how are

2855.2 --> 2859.1189999999997
you gonna claim that's like

2856.48 --> 2859.839
the material that is the entire thing

2859.119 --> 2862.319
and

2859.839 --> 2863.04
why then only can it be found in libya

2862.319 --> 2867.119
makes

2863.04 --> 2867.119
just think about it come on

2867.599 --> 2874.1600000000003
yeah because i don't need a freaking

2870.64 --> 2877.92
dome this [ __ ]

2874.16 --> 2878.64
dome it's the next this is just the next

2877.92 --> 2881.44
level of

2878.64 --> 2882.64
obstacle this is the next aberration and

2881.44 --> 2885.04
they've been

2882.64 --> 2888.16
they've been pushing that [ __ ] from

2885.04 --> 2891.44
under the shadows onto us

2888.16 --> 2892.0
like the controllers the actual planners

2891.44 --> 2896.16
that are

2892.0 --> 2897.359
moving forth the declassification of the

2896.16 --> 2899.52
globe lie

2897.359 --> 2900.4
and they're shoving new aberrations in

2899.52 --> 2903.04
her face

2900.4 --> 2904.559
to make everybody get obsessed over that

2903.04 --> 2906.72
[ __ ]

2904.559 --> 2908.559
just like everybody got obsessed over

2906.72 --> 2910.72
freaking globes and that everything

2908.559 --> 2913.599
makes it glow and all that [ __ ]

2910.72 --> 2914.0
and now everything anything that we'll

2913.599 --> 2916.88
find

2914.0 --> 2918.0
certainly is a hint of a freaking dome

2916.88 --> 2921.599
and everything

2918.0 --> 2925.68
it's just ah i find it aggravating

2921.599 --> 2928.88
that people do this stop

2925.68 --> 2931.52
being just stop reinforcing

2928.88 --> 2931.92
any specific image in your mind stop

2931.52 --> 2934.16
saying

2931.92 --> 2935.6800000000003
everything out there is some kind of

2934.16 --> 2940.0789999999997
story proof

2935.68 --> 2943.839
for this idea stop it

2940.079 --> 2944.96
get real the realm is probably a lot

2943.839 --> 2947.599
more mysterious

2944.96 --> 2949.599
than these basic physical conceptions

2947.599 --> 2954.7200000000003
you've been handed out

2949.599 --> 2954.7200000000003
all right figure it out get

2954.839 --> 2957.839
real

2968.839 --> 2971.839
so

2975.04 --> 2978.5589999999997
no tiny wombo dome is not made up

2977.92 --> 2982.4
nonsense

2978.559 --> 2987.599
a dome is a very

2982.4 --> 2992.48
easy to step to physical solution

2987.599 --> 2994.8
for a container and then there is

2992.48 --> 2998.079
because when you do that when you go

2994.8 --> 2999.92
specifically with a spherical dome

2998.079 --> 3002.1600000000003
you're in the you're going to presuppose

2999.92 --> 3003.04
you're in that would make it slightly

3002.16 --> 3005.2
easier to

3003.04 --> 3007.52
somehow understand how the freaking

3005.2 --> 3010.8799999999997
globe of the heavens works

3007.52 --> 3012.64
without having to actually purely

3010.88 --> 3013.04
realize that they're not even physical

3012.64 --> 3017.5989999999997
things

3013.04 --> 3017.599
it makes it easier on the mind see

3017.92 --> 3025.119
the dome is

3021.839 --> 3028.24
just a very basic stepping tool

3025.119 --> 3030.079
it's so basic but it anchors itself in

3028.24 --> 3032.24
your mind as a

3030.079 --> 3033.2000000000003
based on physicality assumption bias

3032.24 --> 3036.8799999999997
because it makes

3033.2 --> 3041.1189999999997
things more easy it allows

3036.88 --> 3043.2000000000003
the mind to go at rest more easily

3041.119 --> 3045.119
and not bump into all kinds of things

3043.2 --> 3046.64
that like drive you insane because

3045.119 --> 3048.1600000000003
they're just they're turning out to be

3046.64 --> 3050.0789999999997
so complex

3048.16 --> 3052.7999999999997
that's what the freaking dome is for

3050.079 --> 3056.8
it's for the dummies

3052.8 --> 3056.8
to prevent them from going insane

3062.0 --> 3065.44
just oh you can't get a globe well

3063.52 --> 3069.119
here's the dome just go freaking

3065.44 --> 3072.48
fantasize about the dome all day long

3069.119 --> 3072.48
because the glow ain't real

3073.599 --> 3083.839
oh no i don't need a dough

3091.04 --> 3094.4
right yeah tiny wumbo yeah and at the

3093.119 --> 3097.52
same time this dome

3094.4 --> 3099.6800000000003
is constantly being used by ballers as a

3097.52 --> 3102.319
straw man attack on flat earthers and

3099.68 --> 3104.0789999999997
they specifically like to use it on

3102.319 --> 3105.44
yeah on people over at the flat earth

3104.079 --> 3108.4
debates of course

3105.44 --> 3109.359
because we absolutely don't assert that

3108.4 --> 3111.599
ever

3109.359 --> 3113.119
like nobody has been doing that for at

3111.599 --> 3114.96
least two years

3113.119 --> 3116.2400000000002
and i'm proud to say that i was kind of

3114.96 --> 3119.44
like on the front of

3116.24 --> 3121.359
making that happen like can you please

3119.44 --> 3123.28
stop asserting this freaking dome you

3121.359 --> 3124.72
have no proof for

3123.28 --> 3126.6400000000003
you know there's a container it's

3124.72 --> 3128.48
containment yes

3126.64 --> 3130.7999999999997
but that could be anything that could be

3128.48 --> 3134.559
all kinds of thing it could be

3130.8 --> 3138.0
a box could be a limited amount of space

3134.559 --> 3139.52
that loops in on itself yeah if it's not

3138.0 --> 3141.68
yeah there's certainly going to be some

3139.52 --> 3143.119
kind of physical barrier in some way it

3141.68 --> 3144.5589999999997
wouldn't even need to be a material

3143.119 --> 3148.6400000000003
barrier it could simply be

3144.559 --> 3151.8390000000004
the end of physical space

3148.64 --> 3154.24
just like no you can't go beyond this

3151.839 --> 3155.599
or it's just looping in on itself it's

3154.24 --> 3156.4799999999996
like yeah you keep on moving in a

3155.599 --> 3159.6800000000003
straight line

3156.48 --> 3162.8
returning exactly where you were

3159.68 --> 3166.0
if you walk far enough fly far enough

3162.8 --> 3169.28
yeah that is also containment

3166.0 --> 3172.319
you don't need a physical structure

3169.28 --> 3176.4
some material made thing

3172.319 --> 3181.839
to contain everything doesn't need to be

3176.4 --> 3181.839
like that

3189.02 --> 3193.2
[Music]

3190.72 --> 3195.9199999999996
yeah well tiny wombo i know that but the

3193.2 --> 3198.72
thing is yeah

3195.92 --> 3199.28
i get it yeah ballers can definitely be

3198.72 --> 3202.16
all

3199.28 --> 3204.96
be like that towards regulars towards

3202.16 --> 3207.2799999999997
regular flat earthers

3204.96 --> 3209.2
that will probably echo dome and they

3207.28 --> 3211.8390000000004
will be like

3209.2 --> 3214.3999999999996
just yeah shut up it's just the old ways

3211.839 --> 3215.839
like everything happened three years ago

3214.4 --> 3218.2400000000002
when things were all right when there

3215.839 --> 3222.5589999999997
was no black swan when there was no

3218.24 --> 3224.319
academics level flat earther front right

3222.559 --> 3226.3190000000004
it wasn't there yet we didn't have the

3224.319 --> 3229.44
arguments fully built

3226.319 --> 3230.88
hadn't figured it out yet but yeah those

3229.44 --> 3233.119
are the good old days for

3230.88 --> 3234.319
for ballers because we don't do that

3233.119 --> 3236.079
anymore

3234.319 --> 3238.48
at the flat of the debates and me

3236.079 --> 3241.3590000000004
neither specifically

3238.48 --> 3242.2400000000002
so every time somebody brings that forth

3241.359 --> 3246.48
it's just

3242.24 --> 3248.5589999999997
just straw man and every time

3246.48 --> 3251.28
somebody brings forth the idea but yeah

3248.559 --> 3254.2400000000002
but you should be able to see

3251.28 --> 3256.7200000000003
there would be no sunset on a flat earth

3254.24 --> 3258.3999999999996
type of situation it's the same thing

3256.72 --> 3259.7599999999998
i happen to have explained that

3258.4 --> 3261.04
yesterday i think it wasn't on the on

3259.76 --> 3264.3190000000004
the debates

3261.04 --> 3265.52
was it on my show yeah it wasn't my show

3264.319 --> 3269.04
wasn't it

3265.52 --> 3272.72
right why that is also

3269.04 --> 3275.839
a straw man although that one is not

3272.72 --> 3277.9199999999996
yeah not that was never really asserted

3275.839 --> 3279.839
by any flat earther although it was like

3277.92 --> 3282.64
in the beginning stages a problem of

3279.839 --> 3284.88
like basically trying to figure out like

3282.64 --> 3285.92
what is this like what are we seeing how

3284.88 --> 3288.96
does this fit

3285.92 --> 3291.28
in that model refining the heavenly

3288.96 --> 3292.079
lights to be in very specific positions

3291.28 --> 3294.88
and trigonometry

3292.079 --> 3295.8390000000004
and all that and the whole math puzzle

3294.88 --> 3298.7200000000003
went on

3295.839 --> 3299.52
right and then yeah arwyn came along and

3298.72 --> 3302.0789999999997
said like no

3299.52 --> 3303.92
they're not in any position and the

3302.079 --> 3305.28
angular speed of the rotation of the

3303.92 --> 3308.559
heavenly bodies is

3305.28 --> 3310.7200000000003
consistent at all times there's nothing

3308.559 --> 3312.559
moving into the distance or coming from

3310.72 --> 3314.799
the distance towards you

3312.559 --> 3316.3190000000004
nothing of the heavenly lights behaves

3314.799 --> 3318.88
like that ever

3316.319 --> 3321.599
and that means there's simply no

3318.88 --> 3324.6400000000003
physicality about it it's just like

3321.599 --> 3324.6400000000003
just light manifest

3324.72 --> 3330.799
and yeah the next step is to then

3327.839 --> 3330.799
step away from

3331.04 --> 3336.96
physicality assumption bias

3334.88 --> 3339.44
type of thinking assuming that it would

3336.96 --> 3342.64
even have to come from a physical object

3339.44 --> 3344.88
which there are indications against so

3342.64 --> 3347.52
if you go up high enough

3344.88 --> 3351.2000000000003
light drops away or it bends away it's

3347.52 --> 3351.2
not in any specific position

3355.52 --> 3363.04
right and you and and there is no

3359.119 --> 3366.319
natural optics that allows

3363.04 --> 3366.88
normal pinpointable light to behave that

3366.319 --> 3370.079
way

3366.88 --> 3373.52
you see that too you know we know

3370.079 --> 3376.0
how ballers love to imagine that like

3373.52 --> 3380.079
the entire horizon can be refracted like

3376.0 --> 3382.64
20 degrees or whatever but in reality

3380.079 --> 3383.8390000000004
there's nothing within physical

3382.64 --> 3386.24
physicality

3383.839 --> 3387.44
there's no optics effects that actually

3386.24 --> 3391.04
allow light to

3387.44 --> 3394.64
bend like that in just

3391.04 --> 3397.44
regular matter it can't

3394.64 --> 3399.04
so then if we go up high enough and we

3397.44 --> 3401.04
notice that all the heavenly bodies

3399.04 --> 3404.079
significantly bend away or even

3401.04 --> 3407.2799999999997
fade out then we must

3404.079 --> 3409.8390000000004
conclude that they really

3407.28 --> 3410.559
are not lights originating from a

3409.839 --> 3414.88
specific

3410.559 --> 3417.52
object because the layout of the realm

3414.88 --> 3418.0
and even the air just simply would not

3417.52 --> 3420.799
allow

3418.0 --> 3421.52
for light to be able to travel in such a

3420.799 --> 3424.0
fashion

3421.52 --> 3425.44
it's physically impossible for that to

3424.0 --> 3427.92
happen

3425.44 --> 3428.64
therefore the only remaining conclusion

3427.92 --> 3430.799
would be

3428.64 --> 3432.0789999999997
is that the heavenly lights themselves

3430.799 --> 3434.72
are holographic

3432.079 --> 3434.7200000000003
effects

3436.96 --> 3441.119
that just manifest in relation to a

3439.92 --> 3443.52
location

3441.119 --> 3445.599
within an observer like it's almost a

3443.52 --> 3447.2
natural effect that just happens as a

3445.599 --> 3450.799
side effect of sight

3447.2 --> 3452.72
itself and that is my vantage point to

3450.799 --> 3456.4
figuring this out

3452.72 --> 3461.04
i think it's a viable angle to it

3456.4 --> 3465.76
i think i'm on to something big

3461.04 --> 3465.7599999999998
complete realm encompassing big

3471.04 --> 3477.04
all right wow it's already three o'clock

3474.64 --> 3478.48
anyway i'm going to round out the show

3477.04 --> 3480.5589999999997
thanks everyone for coming

3478.48 --> 3481.68
i hope you liked the show if you did

3480.559 --> 3483.3590000000004

mifa indeed

3505.2 --> 3508.5589999999997
and steve and obermoco and yeah i

3508.24 --> 3510.5589999999997
thought

3508.559 --> 3512.6400000000003
at least yeah this the show today

3510.559 --> 3515.0400000000004
started a little slow

3512.64 --> 3516.72
but i think uh yeah the last half hour

3515.04 --> 3517.2799999999997
like flew by and i thought it was pretty

3516.72 --> 3520.72
good

3517.28 --> 3523.2000000000003
so again i'll be back tomorrow flat

3520.72 --> 3524.64
earth early bird number 609

3523.2 --> 3526.5589999999997
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

3524.64 --> 3529.44
debates right after this

3526.559 --> 3530.799
should start up any second now until the

3529.44 --> 3544.12
next video

3530.799 --> 3564.35
keep it flat

3544.12 --> 3564.35
[Music]

3585.839 --> 3587.92
you
