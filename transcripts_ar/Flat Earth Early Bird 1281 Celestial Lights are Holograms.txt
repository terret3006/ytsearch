the seriously turned around

113.84 --> 118.799
it did not

115.6 --> 121.36
rain last night as i kind of did expect

118.799 --> 121.36000000000001
would happen

121.52 --> 126.0
was yeah interesting pretty clear night

124.399 --> 127.6
even

126.0 --> 129.44
surprisingly so the clouds just

127.6 --> 132.48
eventually evaporate and now it's all

129.44 --> 135.28
super clear blue

132.48 --> 135.28
beautiful

135.52 --> 138.48000000000002
trail free

137.12 --> 139.68
day

138.48 --> 141.51999999999998
not just

139.68 --> 144.48000000000002
morning but

141.52 --> 144.48000000000002
afternoon as well

148.08 --> 150.48000000000002
all right

150.56 --> 155.599
still a bit of a breeze but that's just

152.48 --> 155.599
really nice actually

160.16 --> 166.879
check what temperature it is yet but

163.76 --> 169.84
it's not like super hot but it's still

166.879 --> 172.0
kind of nice and warm

169.84 --> 174.08
hello clutch first in chat good to see

172.0 --> 174.08
you

176.08 --> 180.0
you're getting rain

177.68 --> 180.0
huh

180.8 --> 185.76000000000002
oh yeah i did watch that

184.64 --> 188.0
clutch

185.76 --> 190.39999999999998
i mentioned it yesterday

188.0 --> 192.72
i thought it was the [ __ ] up movie

190.4 --> 192.72
really

194.4 --> 198.64000000000001
i was like very

197.36 --> 201.12
agitated

198.64 --> 203.04
a lot of it

201.12 --> 206.4
because i thought that nicolas cage was

203.04 --> 210.0
just like the ultimate gamma and i could

206.4 --> 211.28
like everything he did was just wrong

210.0 --> 214.4
spent uh

211.28 --> 218.159
basically screaming at the screen

214.4 --> 218.159
multiple on multiple occasions

220.239 --> 224.56
uh

222.159 --> 226.959
so yeah i did no to be fair i did not

224.56 --> 230.72
think it was a good movie

226.959 --> 232.48
i thought it was highly demoralizing

230.72 --> 236.4
and

232.48 --> 240.04
just like random insane

236.4 --> 240.04
horror basically

243.12 --> 248.959
hey hello manny young

246.319 --> 252.83999999999997
praying hard last night oh okay so

248.959 --> 257.959
huh so you you got all the rain over

252.84 --> 257.959
there well there's no rain over here

258.39 --> 261.59999999999997
[Music]

283.199 --> 290.88
right anyway it is

286.08 --> 294.56
wednesday the 22nd of june 2022.

290.88 --> 294.56
it's a lot lots of twos

294.8 --> 297.84000000000003
check the temperature

301.759 --> 306.96000000000004
oh 24 degrees

304.72 --> 306.96000000000004
huh

307.28 --> 313.75899999999996
i didn't know was that one

310.479 --> 316.32
stats is gonna get even like 26 degrees

313.759 --> 319.6
according to this forecast

316.32 --> 322.24
29 tomorrow what

319.6 --> 324.88
also rain

322.24 --> 326.72
okay

324.88 --> 331.639
so i guess thursday over here is going

326.72 --> 331.639
to be like as like a storm day

338.16 --> 342.56
right

339.039 --> 342.56
so yeah how are you all doing

343.759 --> 347.84000000000003
uh

345.28 --> 348.96
i'm doing okay better than yesterday

347.84 --> 352.4
still

348.96 --> 355.039
like less issues

352.4 --> 357.59999999999997
with my ballet

355.039 --> 360.0
because yesterday was really bad but i

357.6 --> 361.44
had like a call with my healer after the

360.0 --> 363.759
show

361.44 --> 366.56
even during the fed because it wouldn't

363.759 --> 367.91900000000004
be it wasn't just going away

366.56 --> 371.36
and

367.919 --> 374.15999999999997
yeah i did tell this to the guys i think

371.36 --> 377.6
i don't think i told you yet

374.16 --> 378.84000000000003
but i was basically carrying around like

377.6 --> 380.47900000000004
spirit

378.84 --> 381.67999999999995
remnants

380.479 --> 383.199
from my

381.68 --> 386.08
meeting

383.199 --> 386.08
on saturday

388.56 --> 393.759
i basi i think i caught some like weird

390.96 --> 395.75899999999996
post-traumatic stress stuff

393.759 --> 398.88
i contracted it

395.759 --> 401.759
through my over enthusiasm and empathy

398.88 --> 402.71999999999997
basically made it draw made me draw it

401.759 --> 404.40000000000003
in

402.72 --> 406.72
and that's still what was bothering me i

404.4 --> 410.0
mean that [ __ ] just lingers

406.72 --> 412.72
for months sometimes

410.0 --> 415.919
i can even explain why it's just that

412.72 --> 419.36
yeah it's empathy basically

415.919 --> 419.35999999999996
but yeah you better

419.52 --> 423.08
still somewhat

423.68 --> 426.88
tension and all that

427.199 --> 431.759
so because it is cut it is kind of hot

429.28 --> 431.75899999999996
in here

434.88 --> 439.199
anyway

436.09 --> 442.31899999999996
[Music]

439.199 --> 445.12
i had a pretty late night last night

442.319 --> 447.36
at a very interesting spectacle of like

445.12 --> 450.68
the morning glory

447.36 --> 450.68
of like

451.039 --> 457.039
before the sun comes up where you just

453.36 --> 457.039
get this weird light halo

457.36 --> 461.52000000000004
but the rest is still dark and there was

459.44 --> 463.84
like a moon there

461.52 --> 466.71999999999997
i was like

463.84 --> 467.84
not very full it's kind of

466.72 --> 472.24
thin moon

467.84 --> 475.11999999999995
but you could like see the shadow side

472.24 --> 478.96000000000004
like being darker than

475.12 --> 483.039
the lightening up area

478.96 --> 485.68
it was just a really bizarre site

483.039 --> 489.31899999999996
very interesting also with venus very

485.68 --> 489.319
close to the moon

492.24 --> 497.039
it's like interesting sights very clear

494.879 --> 498.40000000000003
skies and then just the morning glory

497.039 --> 499.919
and the moon and

498.4 --> 500.87899999999996
venus

499.919 --> 505.039
it's

500.879 --> 505.03900000000004
it is really surreal anyhow

505.199 --> 511.149
oh pgcnet

507.95 --> 511.149
[Music]

513.12 --> 516.32
hey mike's a niche

517.279 --> 520.279
huh

520.719 --> 524.0
right so yesterday

524.399 --> 527.2
qe live

528.24 --> 533.92
and then jim bob also went live i didn't

531.279 --> 535.36
go on qe live i don't really do that

533.92 --> 538.0
typically

535.36 --> 539.04
save it for ball busters

538.0 --> 543.279
and

539.04 --> 543.279
but i did actually get on gym bob

543.6 --> 546.72
and was there for like a little under an

545.839 --> 549.2
hour

546.72 --> 551.36
second half of the show

549.2 --> 555.0400000000001
and that was pretty good

551.36 --> 555.04
i'm very satisfied about that

555.519 --> 559.44
so here's the link to that with

557.2 --> 560.839
timestamp

559.44 --> 563.2900000000001
if you want to check that

560.839 --> 565.519
out i thought i did pretty good

563.29 --> 569.92
[Music]

565.519 --> 572.32
i i have to watch it back because

569.92 --> 574.7199999999999
i was just so focused

572.32 --> 577.2
while it was happening

574.72 --> 579.44
that i don't even remember everything

577.2 --> 581.839
that i talked about i think it was well

579.44 --> 584.839
typically psychology

581.839 --> 584.839
psychodynamics

585.12 --> 588.519
spirit mechanics

591.36 --> 597.6
but yeah it's like jim bob and me we can

594.88 --> 599.76
like really on that high level

597.6 --> 602.5600000000001
keep on rolling together

599.76 --> 605.36
it is almost a similar dynamic as i have

602.56 --> 607.5189999999999
with the guys over at flat earth debate

605.36 --> 610.16
because that it is what it is it's like

607.519 --> 613.279
we all work in a dynamic together we all

610.16 --> 616.48
understand the same level and we can

613.279 --> 618.72
heighten our standards to that level

616.48 --> 620.9590000000001
and then we expect that well jim bob can

618.72 --> 624.0790000000001
do that too

620.959 --> 625.04
and it's like it is really great

624.079 --> 626.959
it is

625.04 --> 628.24
really great communicating with him on

626.959 --> 630.2399999999999
that high level

628.24 --> 632.46
i can tell you

630.24 --> 634.64
it's very exhilarating for me

632.46 --> 636.9590000000001
[Music]

634.64 --> 639.6
and yeah i do kind of plan to do that

636.959 --> 639.5999999999999
more often

640.079 --> 646.079
i would like to be more of a standard

643.6 --> 648.9590000000001
guest

646.079 --> 651.12
but yeah i do have to be kind of like in

648.959 --> 652.959
the right conditions for that

651.12 --> 655.36
because sometimes i'm like

652.959 --> 657.4399999999999
drunk or like

655.36 --> 659.6
just feeling weird

657.44 --> 663.36
and then i'm not gonna come on

659.6 --> 663.36
in that state i'll just take the chat

663.44 --> 667.0400000000001
right

664.88 --> 670.04
this time i did get on and it was pretty

667.04 --> 670.04
cool

674.079 --> 678.2399999999999
yeah pgcnet yeah i was enjoying that

676.079 --> 680.959
discussion

678.24 --> 683.6
i think so was jim bob

680.959 --> 684.959
i even got to drop my

683.6 --> 689.0400000000001
oh look

684.959 --> 691.04
oh why do you think that planet

689.04 --> 692.8
why does it look so different when you

691.04 --> 695.12
look at it with your eyes and when you

692.8 --> 696.8
look at it through a camera

695.12 --> 699.68
yeah because it's holographic it's a

696.8 --> 703.64
non-local hologram all optical mediums

699.68 --> 703.64
are going to perceive it differently

704.32 --> 709.12
like all

705.44 --> 709.12
observation mediums i mean

710.32 --> 714.639
so that was pretty cool

712.48 --> 717.2
right because say i know that

714.639 --> 718.639
with gymbop i am gonna basically drop

717.2 --> 721.279
information

718.639 --> 723.12
on a wider plate

721.279 --> 727.279
let's there's

723.12 --> 729.04
a decent amount of people watching jimbo

727.279 --> 732.24
right so for me that's a way to

729.04 --> 732.24
basically spread around

740.88 --> 744.92
hello harley quinn

747.519 --> 751.8
who are you to call us family

761.76 --> 765.8389999999999
hello

762.72 --> 765.839
cyan pipes

766.48 --> 772.859
and you will know us

769.73 --> 772.859
[Music]

778.959 --> 783.4399999999999
look fuzzy yeah but that's not what it's

780.8 --> 786.079
about it's not about it looking fuzzy

783.44 --> 788.399
when you don't focus it's about just

786.079 --> 791.3599999999999
looking different

788.399 --> 793.6
looks different different color effects

791.36 --> 795.519
different sharpness different different

793.6 --> 797.36
different different

795.519 --> 800.0
that was the point not oh it looks

797.36 --> 802.32
blurry on the yeah that's cute that's

800.0 --> 806.6
not what the issue was

802.32 --> 806.6
it's that it looks different

823.44 --> 826.9590000000001
your cat looks different with different

825.279 --> 832.079
cameras no

826.959 --> 832.079
no he doesn't you're just being a liar

837.44 --> 840.839
it's the word

850.32 --> 854.9200000000001
yeah i think obtuse is the right word

852.72 --> 859.1
for it

854.92 --> 859.0999999999999
[Music]

865.44 --> 870.5600000000001
he does no he doesn't

868.959 --> 872.7199999999999
it's still going to look like the same

870.56 --> 874.399
cat with the same diameters the same

872.72 --> 875.44
sharpness

874.399 --> 877.839
whatever

875.44 --> 879.0400000000001
the surroundings are right because it's

877.839 --> 881.1990000000001
an object

879.04 --> 883.199
in physical space

881.199 --> 886.24
it's going to be subjected like an

883.199 --> 887.04
object to the factors including the

886.24 --> 889.6
light

887.04 --> 892.24
of the surroundings whatever optical

889.6 --> 893.9200000000001
medium you're going to use

892.24 --> 896.16
to

893.92 --> 899.16
to perceive it with is not going to

896.16 --> 899.16
matter

899.199 --> 906.0
sure the

901.6 --> 908.0790000000001
coloring outputs the filters whatever

906.0 --> 909.44
it's still going to look the same

908.079 --> 911.279
because it's

909.44 --> 913.6
a physical thing

911.279 --> 915.92
it's a creature physical creature with

913.6 --> 919.279
very specific traits

915.92 --> 919.279
that's not going to be different

925.53 --> 928.559
[Music]

930.16 --> 936.16
can i no no i can't

933.68 --> 938.56
it wasn't my claim even

936.16 --> 941.36
it was the claim of the guy that came on

938.56 --> 943.68
with jim bob just asked like huh it

941.36 --> 945.44
looks different why

943.68 --> 948.7199999999999
so i told him why

945.44 --> 952.9590000000001
because i have seen

948.72 --> 956.24
how just yeah when i look at venus with

952.959 --> 960.079
my eyes it looks bloody damn different

956.24 --> 962.639
than when i actually go and try close up

960.079 --> 967.2399999999999
with like my p900

962.639 --> 967.24
oh yeah it looks different alright

974.0 --> 979.04
like even when i just use

976.8 --> 981.3599999999999
my p900 and like

979.04 --> 983.759
close-up of the moon

981.36 --> 987.279
that already looks different than when i

983.759 --> 987.279
just look at it with my eyes

988.079 --> 992.3199999999999
it's because of the

990.0 --> 994.56
also because of the light workings like

992.32 --> 996.5600000000001
the whole light issue

994.56 --> 997.68
even when i just point my freaking

996.56 --> 1000.2399999999999
camera

997.68 --> 1001.5999999999999
as i do to the weather

1000.24 --> 1004.16
it looks

1001.6 --> 1006.32
different like i pointed up oh look now

1004.16 --> 1007.759
it has this effect on it i'll point down

1006.32 --> 1009.12
oh now suddenly it all starts

1007.759 --> 1011.839
contrasting

1009.12 --> 1011.839
looks different

1012.32 --> 1017.279
because of the light workings and

1014.079 --> 1017.279
contrast and all that

1018.72 --> 1024.72
yeah dude you are a pretty

1021.759 --> 1026.589
crappy sock troll all around and now you

1024.72 --> 1029.759
can [ __ ] off

1026.589 --> 1029.759

[Music]

1061.039 --> 1062.64
all right

1061.84 --> 1064.799
so

1062.64 --> 1066.4
yeah

1064.799 --> 1067.84
it's what it is

1066.4 --> 1070.3200000000002
i talked

1067.84 --> 1071.76
on jim bob's yesterday had a

1070.32 --> 1075.12
great

1071.76 --> 1078.48
what is the 50 minute

1075.12 --> 1078.4799999999998
talk it was great

1078.559 --> 1083.76
i'll probably do it again

1081.2 --> 1087.2
and i'm always open for questions

1083.76 --> 1088.559
unless it's only whining

1087.2 --> 1091.039
yeah

1088.559 --> 1092.72
like these shitty sock trolls that are

1091.039 --> 1096.799
now deleted

1092.72 --> 1099.6000000000001
only whining they only ever whine

1096.799 --> 1101.6
they don't have questions they're only

1099.6 --> 1104.1599999999999
whining

1101.6 --> 1106.08
just whining

1104.16 --> 1108.72
just trying to

1106.08 --> 1111.36
like rip everything apart as much as

1108.72 --> 1113.44
they can just start digging scratching

1111.36 --> 1116.24
clawing

1113.44 --> 1118.48
just to try and destroy all cohesion

1116.24 --> 1120.72
just to try and undermine everything

1118.48 --> 1123.1200000000001
that i would assert anything right it's

1120.72 --> 1125.679
all just wrong because arwen said it so

1123.12 --> 1128.0
it is wrong so you're going to dedicate

1125.679 --> 1133.64
significant amounts of time

1128.0 --> 1133.64
to reinforce that belief about me

1173.28 --> 1178.6399999999999
camera now

1175.36 --> 1181.039
first i get like three years of whining

1178.64 --> 1183.919
about not supposedly even having the

1181.039 --> 1185.44
camera not using it now suddenly it's

1183.919 --> 1190.4
incompetent

1185.44 --> 1193.6000000000001
dude go [ __ ] yourself get out of my chat

1190.4 --> 1196.16

1215.2 --> 1219.64
hello mega metal slugs cocktail

1262.08 --> 1267.36
so anything

1265.039 --> 1270.64
you guys would like me to address other

1267.36 --> 1272.4799999999998
than freaking p900 i know absolutely

1270.64 --> 1276.039
nothing about it nor do i care to

1272.48 --> 1276.039
discuss it

1283.28 --> 1288.1589999999999
yeah metal slugs coca-cola they were

1285.2 --> 1288.96
just whining about the camera and about

1288.159 --> 1290.7990000000002
oh

1288.96 --> 1291.6000000000001
because i i said

1290.799 --> 1293.76
on

1291.6 --> 1296.1589999999999
jim bob's and i reference it here like

1293.76 --> 1297.039
oh why do you think

1296.159 --> 1299.1200000000001
these

1297.039 --> 1300.96
planets look so different when you look

1299.12 --> 1304.6
at them with your eyes and like with

1300.96 --> 1304.6000000000001
cameras and telescopes

1304.72 --> 1309.44
and i said because they're holographic

1306.96 --> 1311.8400000000001
they're non-local holograms

1309.44 --> 1314.72
so of course they then had to

1311.84 --> 1317.52
immediately start pumping out like 20

1314.72 --> 1319.28
different whiny messages about how i am

1317.52 --> 1322.24
wrong apparently

1319.28 --> 1325.12
because of the camera whatever blah blah

1322.24 --> 1327.679
blah because that happens every time

1325.12 --> 1330.3999999999999
every time i say

1327.679 --> 1335.2
they're holograms the celestial lights

1330.4 --> 1337.76
are holograms deal with it it's true

1335.2 --> 1340.48
oh i can't immediately show you the

1337.76 --> 1343.12
graphs and everything i can't create a

1340.48 --> 1346.0
micro simulator i can't build a device

1343.12 --> 1350.32
to show you exactly how it manifests

1346.0 --> 1352.64
well for [ __ ] luck boo hoo for you

1350.32 --> 1355.4399999999998
because it's still true it's going to

1352.64 --> 1357.76
turn out to be true in the future

1355.44 --> 1361.2
and in the future you will all be

1357.76 --> 1363.76
thinking about me and how i kept ramming

1361.2 --> 1366.24
it in you and you wouldn't [ __ ]

1363.76 --> 1368.24
listen or not even get what the hell i'm

1366.24 --> 1371.28
talking about yeah

1368.24 --> 1372.96
because it is true it will be turning

1371.28 --> 1376.24
out to be true

1372.96 --> 1379.44
you get it the celestials are non-local

1376.24 --> 1383.1200000000001
holograms i don't know how it's made i

1379.44 --> 1383.1200000000001
just know that is what it is

1383.84 --> 1389.039
it's nothing else there is no viable

1387.2 --> 1392.0
alternative

1389.039 --> 1394.64
there is no viable alternative

1392.0 --> 1398.96
all the other alternatives that people

1394.64 --> 1401.5200000000002
have imagined about them are falsifiable

1398.96 --> 1404.64
and the data that would be required to

1401.52 --> 1405.9189999999999
back up those assertions are all

1404.64 --> 1407.5200000000002
missing

1405.919 --> 1411.039
it's over

1407.52 --> 1414.4
you get it they're non-local holograms

1411.039 --> 1418.08
and you have no proof to the contrary

1414.4 --> 1422.48
you get it yet get the [ __ ] over it with

1418.08 --> 1424.96
your over expensive [ __ ] equipment

1422.48 --> 1426.96
that you wasted all your money on

1424.96 --> 1429.039

1426.96 --> 1432.88
fantasies about how their whole body is

1429.039 --> 1435.52
at giant distances you're idiots

1432.88 --> 1438.159
and you wasted all your money because of

1435.52 --> 1440.96
your stupid little fantasy

1438.159 --> 1443.679
and all this techno babble

1440.96 --> 1444.4
nonsense from your side

1443.679 --> 1446.64

1444.4 --> 1448.72
oh look at the camera always oh look at

1446.64 --> 1450.7990000000002
this different type of lynching

simply

1490.48 --> 1497.0
take you away from that love so then you

1558.64 --> 1560.88

1568.48 --> 1573.44
discussions with them anymore

1570.64 --> 1575.3600000000001
i'd love to debate flat earthers about

1573.44 --> 1578.159
my assertions

1575.36 --> 1582.0
i'm not even going to discuss it with

1578.159 --> 1585.5200000000002
anti-flat earthers or ballers anymore

1582.0 --> 1588.48
because they are not actually inquiring

1585.52 --> 1590.96
they're only trying to ridicule only

1588.48 --> 1594.679
ridiculing

1590.96 --> 1594.679
only ridiculing

1619.919 --> 1627.0
okay

1621.919 --> 1627.0
venus has phases like does it

1629.12 --> 1632.1589999999999
really

1630.4 --> 1636.2
i didn't even know that or i've

1632.159 --> 1636.2
forgotten huh

1657.039 --> 1661.24
yeah yeah you get it

1659.919 --> 1664.72
i know

1661.24 --> 1668.48
heliocentrism is extremely dependent on

1664.72 --> 1670.559
the celestials not being holograms

1668.48 --> 1671.919
they have to all be physical or they

1670.559 --> 1674.399
have nothing

1671.919 --> 1676.159
literally their entire

1674.399 --> 1678.9599999999998
vastness

1676.159 --> 1682.24
all the vastness all the astronomical

1678.96 --> 1685.039
distances and amounts it's all gone in

1682.24 --> 1688.08
one fell swoop it's all gone there's

1685.039 --> 1688.08
nothing there now

1688.32 --> 1691.279
because

1689.2 --> 1693.3600000000001
those things you see those lights are

1691.279 --> 1695.44
not objects

1693.36 --> 1698.399
none of them are

1695.44 --> 1701.3990000000001
they're all non-local holographic

1698.399 --> 1701.399
manifestations

1702.0 --> 1704.48

no

1704.48 --> 1710.1200000000001
heliocentric universe out there it

1706.72 --> 1710.1200000000001
doesn't exist

1730.0 --> 1735.12
kicking you all out trolls just kicking

1732.72 --> 1735.1200000000001
you out

1735.52 --> 1740.32
where are the holograms being projected

1737.6 --> 1743.36
from i don't know

1740.32 --> 1745.36
i don't know anything about how

1743.36 --> 1747.36
or where from

1745.36 --> 1749.84
how the energy

1747.36 --> 1752.24
all of the factors i don't know

1749.84 --> 1755.039
i don't know about it i just know they

1752.24 --> 1758.96
are non-local holograms

1755.039 --> 1760.64
and the evidence for any physical

1758.96 --> 1764.159
nature involved

1760.64 --> 1766.64
or locality of any sort involved is

1764.159 --> 1769.1200000000001
completely elusive

1766.64 --> 1770.64
you have no evidence for any of those

1769.12 --> 1772.1589999999999
factors

1770.64 --> 1773.5200000000002
the only

1772.159 --> 1775.44
logically

1773.52 --> 1779.399
available option

1775.44 --> 1779.3990000000001
is non-local hologram

1781.039 --> 1786.24
how do i know they are because that's

1783.2 --> 1787.2
the only available option

1786.24 --> 1788.48
left

1787.2 --> 1791.279
the others

1788.48 --> 1794.84
are not there those options are not it

1791.279 --> 1794.84
they're disproved

1799.039 --> 1805.8799999999999
so done

1800.72 --> 1805.88
it's the only available known option

1810.559 --> 1815.6
unless you know

1812.48 --> 1819.6
existence in another form that is

1815.6 --> 1822.1589999999999
perceivable yet not physically there if

1819.6 --> 1824.08
you do you know any factor like that no

1822.159 --> 1827.2
no yeah me neither that's why it's a

1824.08 --> 1827.1999999999998
non-local hologram

1827.279 --> 1831.88
you don't land on a hologram numpty

1837.279 --> 1841.76
that's hilarious mr dispensable

1847.279 --> 1850.88
do you see no need to make that claim

1849.039 --> 1853.12
well yeah well it's not your issue

1850.88 --> 1855.2
nathan you're not trying to actually

1853.12 --> 1857.6
define

1855.2 --> 1861.1200000000001
the complex workings

1857.6 --> 1862.799
you're just trying to establish how to

1861.12 --> 1866.0
assure

1862.799 --> 1868.559
baller defeat

1866.0 --> 1873.559
oh that's not my main objective

1868.559 --> 1873.559
that's just a side quest to me

1890.559 --> 1894.559
yeah i wonder if the anti-flat earth has

1892.559 --> 1898.8799999999999
even realized that

1894.559 --> 1902.48
that yeah me taking all of you on

1898.88 --> 1904.3990000000001
is just a side quest to me you get it

1902.48 --> 1907.76
it's not the main thing

1904.399 --> 1910.8799999999999
you're literally like goblin nuisance on

1907.76 --> 1912.48
a side quest to me

1910.88 --> 1916.0
you hear

1912.48 --> 1918.24
that's how much value you have to me how

1916.0 --> 1922.08
much significance

1918.24 --> 1925.32
in my life you're just a side quest

1922.08 --> 1925.32
you understand

1926.06 --> 1932.47

1951.44 --> 1955.44

1983.519 --> 1987.32
hello by the way gordzilla

2000.72 --> 2003.72
what

okay so you're basically okay that is

2008.48 --> 2014.64
very trollish nathan so you're basically

2011.44 --> 2018.6000000000001
criticizing them on their use of their

2014.64 --> 2018.6000000000001

through a camera as when you look at

2039.84 --> 2043.76
them with your eyes

2041.84 --> 2045.36
that that's because of the

2043.76 --> 2046.799
because you don't know how to use the

2045.36 --> 2049.799
camera basically that's what he was

[Music]

2118.4 --> 2121.4

2123.47 --> 2126.5299999999997
[Music]

2150.0 --> 2153.2
don't do that

2151.599 --> 2154.6400000000003
dominoid

2153.2 --> 2155.9199999999996
don't

2154.64 --> 2157.839
make

2155.92 --> 2158.8
jokes of

2157.839 --> 2163.04

feed him you want me to ban you tomonoid

2167.92 --> 2170.96
never do that again

2171.68 --> 2175.2
yeah nathan bringing it up is bad enough

2174.079 --> 2179.04
as it is

2175.2 --> 2183.2799999999997
because every time you do that

2179.04 --> 2186.16
every single time you even chuckle a

2183.28 --> 2188.88
little bit at anything related to these

2186.16 --> 2192.64
[ __ ] sock trolls

2188.88 --> 2196.04
you give them a piece of your soul stop

2192.64 --> 2196.04
doing that

2200.32 --> 2202.8
yes

2205.359 --> 2209.48
they just don't exist

2228.4 --> 2230.8
i know

2231.28 --> 2235.0400000000004
but i understood that that's not worthy

2233.52 --> 2237.839
to you

2235.04 --> 2241.359
and yeah you got to realize these soft

2237.839 --> 2245.04
troll [ __ ] bastards

2241.359 --> 2247.2
they put a lot of effort

2245.04 --> 2250.079
even into the names because they have

2247.2 --> 2251.7599999999998
one sole objective that is to as they

2250.079 --> 2254.6400000000003
say

2251.76 --> 2256.96
dominate the show they want to be the

2254.64 --> 2260.8799999999997
thing that determines what is talked

2256.96 --> 2264.2400000000002
about every time you look at their name

2260.88 --> 2264.2400000000002
even just look at it

2264.32 --> 2269.44
you give them a win every single time so

2268.16 --> 2271.5989999999997
the only

2269.44 --> 2274.079
sensible course of action is to

2271.599 --> 2277.599
literally don't

2274.079 --> 2281.6800000000003
reply to their existence

2277.599 --> 2284.2400000000002
erase it erase it completely don't laugh

2281.68 --> 2287.52
don't look at it don't even make your

2284.24 --> 2290.4799999999996
eyes wander to that deleted spot

2287.52 --> 2293.52
look around it don't look at it it

2290.48 --> 2293.52
doesn't exist

2294.32 --> 2298.599
all right yeah see you later nathan

2299.07 --> 2306.059
[Music]

2307.599 --> 2311.76
no we can't erase virus

2310.24 --> 2315.04
virus is just

2311.76 --> 2319.32
a numpty he's not

2315.04 --> 2319.32
yeah he's not that terrible

2333.2 --> 2340.2
yeah that's very funny gadget inspector

2336.72 --> 2340.2
very funny

2370.88 --> 2373.119
right

2374.88 --> 2380.4
well you know what you know how you

2376.88 --> 2382.56
could fix this this sickening sock troll

2380.4 --> 2385.359
problem

2382.56 --> 2387.839
by making it standard this is a

2385.359 --> 2389.359
potential tip to youtube by making it

2387.839 --> 2391.119
standard

2389.359 --> 2394.24
that you can't

2391.119 --> 2396.8
participate in chat

2394.24 --> 2399.52
for at least

2396.8 --> 2403.28
well a month

2399.52 --> 2404.16
a month after creation of an account

2403.28 --> 2406.3190000000004
huh

2404.16 --> 2410.0
what do you think about that

2406.319 --> 2412.48
how are you gonna fix that up yeah you

2410.0 --> 2414.96
have to make all the stupid socks in

2412.48 --> 2417.28
advance and then yeah one click they're

2414.96 --> 2419.119
gone you can never use them again on

2417.28 --> 2421.599
that channel

2419.119 --> 2425.0
and oh what you gonna do wait another

2421.599 --> 2425.0
six months

2426.56 --> 2432.04
right or a month or six months however

2429.04 --> 2432.04
long

2451.839 --> 2458.24
you can set a longer time yeah pgc net

2454.319 --> 2458.24
but that's that's not the same thing

2458.4 --> 2462.96
there is a slight delay

2461.28 --> 2465.76
right in the chat

2462.96 --> 2468.4
slow mode but that's only to prevent

2465.76 --> 2468.4
spamming

2468.56 --> 2475.2799999999997
subscribers only mode well yeah you

2471.92 --> 2476.4
i mean a sock account can subscribe too

2475.28 --> 2480.1600000000003
right

2476.4 --> 2483.2000000000003
takes a little bit more time

2480.16 --> 2483.2
but not too much

2487.76 --> 2493.599
i mean effectively the only real way to

2490.88 --> 2495.52
to truly get rid of them is to literally

2493.599 --> 2498.0
force them to pay

2495.52 --> 2501.92
just to be able to say stuff

2498.0 --> 2501.92
by making it a members only

2502.88 --> 2506.4
but then again there's a whole bunch of

2504.64 --> 2509.4
you that wouldn't be able to talk in my

2506.4 --> 2509.4
chat

2521.34 --> 2524.3990000000003
[Music]

2531.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
it'd be just you cortila yeah and of the

2534.56 --> 2537.839
wrenches too

2556.4 --> 2563.88
wow really good inspector 10 minutes you

2559.599 --> 2563.88
have to actually wait 10 minutes

2565.359 --> 2570.0
isn't that like you have to be

2567.119 --> 2573.28
subscribed for at least 10 minutes

2570.0 --> 2575.2
i've seen that on d live i think

2573.28 --> 2579.7200000000003
you couldn't comment unless you were

2575.2 --> 2579.72
subscribed for a certain amount of time

2582.4 --> 2587.1600000000003
hey

2583.28 --> 2587.1600000000003
our p12 vacation

2633.52 --> 2638.88
right you're concerned yeah that's just

2635.68 --> 2641.2
how they work sometimes

2638.88 --> 2642.1600000000003
so yeah that's how much effort these

2641.2 --> 2645.04
decks

2642.16 --> 2649.0
in chat actually make so these people

2645.04 --> 2649.0
really have no life

2649.44 --> 2654.64
they they can't like these people have

2652.16 --> 2657.92
absolutely no life they can't or they

2654.64 --> 2660.989
wouldn't be doing this

2657.92 --> 2660.989
[Music]

2662.079 --> 2665.92
crockett

2663.599 --> 2669.119
i mean a guy like me

2665.92 --> 2672.8
why the [ __ ] would you even do that i'm

2669.119 --> 2674.7200000000003
effectively societally a nobody i'm not

2672.8 --> 2676.6400000000003
going to pretend like that's different

2674.72 --> 2679.839
than it is

2676.64 --> 2683.04
why the hell would you nag me

2679.839 --> 2685.68
i effectively have barely have any reach

2683.04 --> 2687.2799999999997
i i might have some influence i may have

2685.68 --> 2690.16
some respect

2687.28 --> 2692.5600000000004
but it's really not enough to really

2690.16 --> 2696.319
take notice off on the larger scale so i

2692.56 --> 2698.96
don't even understand why they do it

2696.319 --> 2702.0
right why they go after nathan oakley i

2698.96 --> 2702.839
totally get that because nathan is

2702.0 --> 2707.2
well

2702.839 --> 2710.64
really making a profile for himself

2707.2 --> 2714.3999999999996
he is doing a lot of effort to

2710.64 --> 2717.1189999999997
become like a new standard and

2714.4 --> 2718.7200000000003
and get reach get as much res reach as

2717.119 --> 2720.96
he can right

2718.72 --> 2723.2
i'm not really doing that

2720.96 --> 2725.839
nathan puts in much more effort into his

2723.2 --> 2727.2799999999997
youtube channel than i do

2725.839 --> 2730.2799999999997
i'm just mostly trying to stay

2727.28 --> 2730.28
consistent

2732.16 --> 2737.1189999999997
at least they are off the streets

2734.88 --> 2737.119
well

2737.92 --> 2742.88
i don't know

2739.599 --> 2742.88
i don't know if that's better

2743.2 --> 2747.4399999999996
i mean

2744.96 --> 2749.28
i'd rather have these troll [ __ ] hats on

2747.44 --> 2750.88
the street why'd you go hang around on

2749.28 --> 2751.76
the street and [ __ ]

2750.88 --> 2754.4
right

2751.76 --> 2756.079
that's much easier to avoid

2754.4 --> 2759.119
it's not like you have to go on the

2756.079 --> 2759.119
street all the time

2759.28 --> 2764.6400000000003
right but yeah you can't avoid them if

2762.079 --> 2767.2000000000003
they keep coming to your channel to

2764.64 --> 2771.16
troll you

2767.2 --> 2771.16
how are you going to avoid that

2780.8 --> 2784.6400000000003
right kicking over gravestones getting

2782.8 --> 2788.96
into trouble getting into fights and

2784.64 --> 2791.92
then getting killed as they should so

2788.96 --> 2793.04
just let them do that then

2791.92 --> 2796.079
yeah

2793.04 --> 2796.079
let them do that

2796.8 --> 2800.48
that's what they want to do then let

2798.48 --> 2803.48
them do that

2800.48 --> 2803.48
right

2810.64 --> 2815.359
let's get into trouble

2812.64 --> 2818.72
get into trouble physically

2815.359 --> 2821.5989999999997
piss some people off physically get into

2818.72 --> 2824.24
more trouble yeah i have no problem with

2821.599 --> 2826.319
these troll pieces of [ __ ]

2824.24 --> 2829.359
being forced off the internet to do

2826.319 --> 2830.8
their crap on the street with the actual

2829.359 --> 2832.4
risk

2830.8 --> 2835.6400000000003
let them do it

2832.4 --> 2835.64
do it

2847.04 --> 2852.4
sometimes i disagree who cares aren't go

2849.92 --> 2852.4
wombo

2852.96 --> 2857.76
i don't care if you guys agree

2856.079 --> 2860.96
whether

2857.76 --> 2863.0400000000004
i ban people or not i don't care

2860.96 --> 2864.0
i'm not asking for people's opinion

2863.04 --> 2867.119
about it

2864.0 --> 2869.52
this is just my policy

2867.119 --> 2872.559
and it's complex

2869.52 --> 2874.64
and sometimes i preemptively ban people

2872.559 --> 2877.119
because there's a psychological war

2874.64 --> 2879.359
happening

2877.119 --> 2882.88
yes i know i read the rest fair enough

2879.359 --> 2884.88
it's orange channel yeah it's fine

2882.88 --> 2887.599
it's just that you had to start with i

2884.88 --> 2890.2400000000002
disagree with

2887.599 --> 2890.2400000000002
or whatever

2891.92 --> 2894.48
it's fine

2894.559 --> 2897.28
i'm just saying

2898.72 --> 2904.7999999999997
sometimes they're just trolls

2901.76 --> 2907.8390000000004
and it's about the timing it's about

2904.8 --> 2911.52
the moment they come in out of nowhere

2907.839 --> 2912.48
it has to be the trolls it has to be

2911.52 --> 2914.96
them

2912.48 --> 2916.8
i can feel it when it is a troll or it's

2914.96 --> 2920.2400000000002
an actual new person

2916.8 --> 2922.2400000000002
instantly so yeah i will just ban

2920.24 --> 2924.319
swaths of people

2922.24 --> 2926.16
like four or five accounts that suddenly

2924.319 --> 2927.2799999999997
come rolling in because that's how they

2926.16 --> 2928.64
do it

2927.28 --> 2931.92
yeah

2928.64 --> 2933.04
they're trying to claim ground like a

2931.92 --> 2934.7200000000003
gang

2933.04 --> 2936.96
a gang of thugs

2934.72 --> 2939.1189999999997
so you have to immediately kick them all

2936.96 --> 2939.119
out

2939.28 --> 2945.2000000000003
right even if they didn't say anything

2942.079 --> 2948.2400000000002
weird in the moment if they just say hi

2945.2 --> 2951.359
right but with a [ __ ] up name and

2948.24 --> 2953.4399999999996
and the timing i know it's them i know

2951.359 --> 2956.5589999999997
it has to be them

2953.44 --> 2958.7200000000003
so i kick them out immediately

2956.559 --> 2961.119
immediately no doubt

2958.72 --> 2965.2
instant execution

2961.119 --> 2968.1600000000003
coming around the corner hi bang dead

2965.2 --> 2969.5989999999997
[ __ ] off i know it's you

2968.16 --> 2971.68
[ __ ] off

2969.599 --> 2974.079
if you know me if you pay attention to

2971.68 --> 2977.04
what's going on and you're new you

2974.079 --> 2979.599
wouldn't have done that

2977.04 --> 2982.0
but you did so you are the troll and now

2979.599 --> 2984.079
you're dead you're banned i shoot you in

2982.0 --> 2986.8
the head immediately the second you come

2984.079 --> 2988.1600000000003
around that corner immediately that's

2986.8 --> 2990.4500000000003
how i do it

2988.16 --> 2993.6099999999997
i'm not gonna change that

2990.45 --> 2993.6099999999997
[Music]

2996.72 --> 3002.72
hey streaming traveler

2999.119 --> 3002.7200000000003
yeah i'm feeling better today

3002.96 --> 3007.359

3005.119 --> 3010.319
yesterday is the yesterday was really

3007.359 --> 3010.319
not feeling great

3011.28 --> 3014.6400000000003
but

3012.16 --> 3016.48
as we talked about

3014.64 --> 3018.0
yeah i had a treatment for my healer

3016.48 --> 3019.52
over the phone by the way always over

3018.0 --> 3020.96
the phone

3019.52 --> 3023.119
and

3020.96 --> 3026.92
that helped back then and it's helping

3023.119 --> 3026.92
now i think so

3036.64 --> 3041.04
yeah get you suspected it's all so

3038.64 --> 3043.359
freaking funny to you but

3041.04 --> 3045.52
do you remember when i banned you do you

3043.359 --> 3047.68
remember how long you were crying and

3045.52 --> 3049.68
whining when i did that

3047.68 --> 3051.68
maybe you should be acting like a 12

3049.68 --> 3055.839
year old in my chat

3051.68 --> 3055.839
i think that everything is just funny

3058.16 --> 3062.0789999999997
maybe it's a french thing i don't know

3067.04 --> 3071.599
hey tony

3068.4 --> 3071.599
sleeping warrior good see you

3072.88 --> 3079.079
any evidence of blurfs actually defining

3075.2 --> 3079.0789999999997
terms yet no

3082.48 --> 3086.319
but

3084.0 --> 3088.48
they can't do that

3086.319 --> 3091.96
they do that then they just immediately

3088.48 --> 3091.96
run into trouble

3148.079 --> 3150.88
yeah tony

3150.96 --> 3155.52
and

3151.76 --> 3155.5200000000004
they like at homes more right

3155.68 --> 3159.2799999999997
so

3157.2 --> 3161.359
they just basically become like

3159.28 --> 3163.2000000000003
political assassins

3161.359 --> 3164.64
they don't have arguments for their

3163.2 --> 3167.16
position

3164.64 --> 3169.92
or it's really broken so they just learn

3167.16 --> 3172.16
everything they can about the opponent

3169.92 --> 3175.04
try to figure out their weaknesses

3172.16 --> 3178.48
so they are like

3175.04 --> 3180.88
social media assassins now

3178.48 --> 3182.8
wouldn't you say

3180.88 --> 3186.4
they're more

3182.8 --> 3189.6800000000003
invested in strategies involving social

3186.4 --> 3192.4
assassination than actual philosophical

3189.68 --> 3194.24
argumentation

3192.4 --> 3197.04
right because the at-home but it's more

3194.24 --> 3199.2
than just standard throw it at the

3197.04 --> 3201.839
at-home right it's not like an impulsive

3199.2 --> 3205.5989999999997
like oh it's just you no no they

3201.839 --> 3208.16
actually profile you they learn every

3205.599 --> 3210.0
trait about you they make they keep

3208.16 --> 3211.7599999999998
records

3210.0 --> 3214.16
of what has happened with you as a

3211.76 --> 3216.2400000000002
person in certain incidents they keep

3214.16 --> 3218.24
records of us tony

3216.24 --> 3220.16
you know that right you know they keep

3218.24 --> 3224.24
records on us

3220.16 --> 3226.7999999999997
because to them their primary

3224.24 --> 3229.52
long-term strategy and goal is to just

3226.8 --> 3232.079
collect as much dirt on us as possible

3229.52 --> 3235.2
so they can

3232.079 --> 3239.04
assassinate us socially because they

3235.2 --> 3241.2
have no actual philosophical arguments

3239.04 --> 3243.92
it's all broken

3241.2 --> 3244.72
they have nothing like not even a little

3243.92 --> 3246.319
bit

3244.72 --> 3249.52
right

3246.319 --> 3252.72
i mean the only way they can even

3249.52 --> 3254.88
attain a radius value for their globe

3252.72 --> 3257.1189999999997
earth is by

3254.88 --> 3259.76
measuring a flat plane and then deriving

3257.119 --> 3259.76
it from that

3260.8 --> 3264.319
and they know it

3262.16 --> 3266.5589999999997
i think that that is probably the most

3264.319 --> 3267.92
punishing realization that they've ever

3266.559 --> 3270.7200000000003
come across

3267.92 --> 3272.2400000000002
it's kind of like sort of naturally

3270.72 --> 3274.0789999999997
started

3272.24 --> 3276.0
leaking out this year it's like yeah

3274.079 --> 3278.6400000000003
yeah yeah you actually do need a flat

3276.0 --> 3281.2
plane

3278.64 --> 3283.2
to actually yeah to

3281.2 --> 3286.96
to create that globe model

3283.2 --> 3286.96
you need it you need it flat

3287.44 --> 3292.64
like if they didn't have that flat plane

3290.48 --> 3294.4
to start with

3292.64 --> 3296.24
their measurements then

3294.4 --> 3298.48
they would have never had this globe

3296.24 --> 3300.4799999999996
model the way it is right now

3298.48 --> 3302.96
you see

3300.48 --> 3306.4
so yeah i i'm not surprised that after

3302.96 --> 3309.92
this point ad homing becoming social

3306.4 --> 3311.44
assassins is the only course of action

3309.92 --> 3313.92
left to them

3311.44 --> 3317.04
unless they just will finally give up

3313.92 --> 3318.64
and get a [ __ ] life

3317.04 --> 3321.839
but yeah for most of them that's not

3318.64 --> 3321.839
really an option anymore

3321.92 --> 3325.6800000000003
because they just are too gross

3324.559 --> 3330.3190000000004
to

3325.68 --> 3330.319
to repulsive right can't go back

3330.64 --> 3335.52
being a social assassin manipulator

3333.2 --> 3339.1189999999997
scumbag is all they have left

3335.52 --> 3339.119
because everybody hates them now

3340.64 --> 3344.24
right so and they even can use that

3343.2 --> 3346.799
right to

3344.24 --> 3350.5589999999997
being hated is just for them an easy

3346.799 --> 3354.16
tool to be able to project how everybody

3350.559 --> 3356.1600000000003
hates you onto your target

3354.16 --> 3359.68
it's very satanic

3356.16 --> 3364.319
it is it's what they do

3359.68 --> 3367.7599999999998
it is very satanic to do that

3364.319 --> 3367.7599999999998
and they do it all the time

3372.799 --> 3377.839
hey john bernards

3374.72 --> 3377.839
bobby stills

3416.4 --> 3424.599
oh man finally

3420.0 --> 3424.599
the sun is no longer hitting the wall

3435.599 --> 3441.0
the gravitons

3437.52 --> 3441.0
oh my god

3459.23 --> 3462.369
[Music]

3472.96 --> 3477.68
gravitons gravitrons it's all the same

3477.92 --> 3483.52
we just seen it

3480.16 --> 3485.44
it's all just made up [ __ ]

3483.52 --> 3489.559
or you name it one way or another

3485.44 --> 3489.559
doesn't really matter in the end

3507.839 --> 3513.7599999999998
gravitron 3 was a good movie

3511.28 --> 3515.599
what is there really a movie like you're

3513.76 --> 3518.3190000000004
kidding right

3515.599 --> 3518.319
never heard of that

3524.4 --> 3529.04
yes tony they hate the definition of

3526.4 --> 3532.2400000000002
effect well they hate

3529.04 --> 3534.24
the definitions of physics

3532.24 --> 3536.24
in general they hate all of it because

3534.24 --> 3539.2799999999997
it's so specific

3536.24 --> 3540.9599999999996
and that specificity so very well and

3539.28 --> 3542.48
detailed

3540.96 --> 3545.68
well worked out

3542.48 --> 3547.04
and they can't apply their nonsense to

3545.68 --> 3549.9199999999996
it so

3547.04 --> 3552.4
yeah anti-flat earthers hate

3549.92 --> 3552.4
physics

3554.96 --> 3557.96
hello

3558.0 --> 3560.799
you still hear me

3561.44 --> 3565.839
yeah my internet got cut off

3564.4 --> 3567.28
i think i

3565.839 --> 3568.7799999999997
yeah

3567.28 --> 3576.2090000000003
i'm back

3568.78 --> 3576.2090000000003
[Music]

3577.76 --> 3583.7200000000003
right yeah yeah the graphitron was that

3579.599 --> 3583.7200000000003
centrifuge thing right

3597.28 --> 3604.559
it's so funny how they suggest that

3601.16 --> 3604.5589999999997
centrifugal force

3605.839 --> 3611.359
is

3607.119 --> 3611.359
like gravity right they always say that

3612.0 --> 3616.64
they always tend to say that [ __ ] right

3614.88 --> 3618.319
that's even how you start learning about

3616.64 --> 3619.92
in school well

3618.319 --> 3622.5589999999997
technically it

3619.92 --> 3624.2400000000002
it's always overlooked how it is exactly

3622.559 --> 3626.2400000000002
the opposite of how gravity is

3624.24 --> 3630.4799999999996
suggesting to function right

3626.24 --> 3633.04
a centrifugal force is to the outside

3630.48 --> 3635.68
and gravity is supposed to be to the

3633.04 --> 3635.68
inside

3636.64 --> 3640.96
but

3638.0 --> 3643.839
why is centrifugal force always the go

3640.96 --> 3645.28
to description for gravity when it is

3643.839 --> 3649.2799999999997
technically

3645.28 --> 3652.079
quite the opposite it is literally

3649.28 --> 3654.0
away from the center instead of towards

3652.079 --> 3656.48
a center which is what gravity is

3654.0 --> 3657.28
suggested to be

3656.48 --> 3661.119
right

3657.28 --> 3663.599
that even stood out to me like in school

3661.119 --> 3668.079
and i was like 12 and

3663.599 --> 3668.079
no no wait i think 13 or 14.

3668.4 --> 3672.7200000000003
that really stood out to me it's like

3670.48 --> 3675.92
okay

3672.72 --> 3679.2799999999997
so the example for gravitation

3675.92 --> 3681.28
of something moving towards

3679.28 --> 3683.76
a central point is going to be

3681.28 --> 3685.0400000000004
demonstrated by something spinning

3683.76 --> 3688.48
around

3685.04 --> 3689.7599999999998
moving things to the outside

3688.48 --> 3692.079
um

3689.76 --> 3693.9300000000003
that seems

3692.079 --> 3697.11
very confusing

3693.93 --> 3697.1099999999997
[Music]

3698.96 --> 3703.16
hey psych bear good to see you

3736.48 --> 3740.64
it's the most convincing reason

3739.28 --> 3742.96
reason

3740.64 --> 3745.7599999999998
i don't need a reason

3742.96 --> 3748.559
for a flat earth it's just flat there's

3745.76 --> 3750.96
no geometric horizon that comports with

3748.559 --> 3753.039
the globe geometry

3750.96 --> 3755.76
there's no coriolis deviation because

3753.039 --> 3757.76
earth is stationary and it we have gas

3755.76 --> 3760.7990000000004
pressure so it has to be contained earth

3757.76 --> 3761.92
is not a spinning ball in outer space

3760.799 --> 3762.88
it is a

3761.92 --> 3764.16
flat

3762.88 --> 3767.76
contained

3764.16 --> 3771.16
realm that is stationary and designed

3767.76 --> 3771.1600000000003
by god

3789.52 --> 3793.2
okay sequoia rain

3791.44 --> 3795.119
projection's a narcissist number one

3793.2 --> 3797.52
weapon

3795.119 --> 3800.1600000000003
is it their number one weapon i know

3797.52 --> 3804.64
they always end up using it but is it

3800.16 --> 3804.64
like the first go-to i wouldn't say so

3805.119 --> 3808.88
i mean

3806.799 --> 3811.44
projection they're only really gonna use

3808.88 --> 3812.88
that the moment somebody tries to break

3811.44 --> 3815.039
through the

3812.88 --> 3816.96
claimed authority of the narcissist

3815.039 --> 3819.2000000000003
that's when they typically start

3816.96 --> 3821.52
projecting

3819.2 --> 3823.0389999999998
especially like pylon projecting right

3821.52 --> 3825.28
it's not just projecting because

3823.039 --> 3827.6800000000003
projecting is kind of a natural effect

3825.28 --> 3829.52
is not necessarily nefarious

3827.68 --> 3832.319
you don't have to consciously know

3829.52 --> 3834.72
you're projecting to do it

3832.319 --> 3836.079
regular projecting is just their [ __ ] on

3834.72 --> 3837.359
your mind

3836.079 --> 3839.119
you're thinking about that because

3837.359 --> 3841.5989999999997
you're dealing with it so you're going

3839.119 --> 3843.28
to assume that the other is involved in

3841.599 --> 3846.48
such a thing right that's typical

3843.28 --> 3847.52
projection what the narcissist does

3846.48 --> 3850.16
is

3847.52 --> 3852.24
they claim an authority about something

3850.16 --> 3855.359
then somebody just says like oh but what

3852.24 --> 3855.359
about this and then

3855.68 --> 3859.1189999999997
they

3856.64 --> 3860.48
like throw something really dark on

3859.119 --> 3862.1600000000003
there right

3860.48 --> 3864.799
out of nowhere that's typically

3862.16 --> 3868.0789999999997
narcissist is to suddenly get really

3864.799 --> 3870.64
dark out of nowhere without a proper

3868.079 --> 3873.28
logical build up to it right a logical

3870.64 --> 3875.92
social situation type build up then they

3873.28 --> 3878.6400000000003
get really dark out of nowhere

3875.92 --> 3880.64
and like basically project some really

3878.64 --> 3882.319
dead terrible darkness inside of them

3880.64 --> 3883.839
that has nothing to do with the person

3882.319 --> 3886.64
or the situation

3883.839 --> 3888.96
on to them to really like mesmerize them

3886.64 --> 3891.2
and shock them right to disable them

3888.96 --> 3893.76
that is the type of projection that

3891.2 --> 3896.0
narcissists do it's very different from

3893.76 --> 3898.48
just natural

3896.0 --> 3900.0
psychological projection which almost

3898.48 --> 3902.72
all people do

3900.0 --> 3902.72
in occasion

3905.44 --> 3912.48
when it's an observation no no the black

3908.72 --> 3915.1189999999997
swan is an argument and it isn't science

3912.48 --> 3919.96
yeah it is not science not claimed to be

3915.119 --> 3919.96
the cause of an effect relationship

3922.559 --> 3926.1600000000003
lex 1

3923.76 --> 3929.8390000000004
is a technical argument

3926.16 --> 3933.7599999999998
that uses observation to make that

3929.839 --> 3933.7599999999998
argument the modus tollens

3935.599 --> 3942.6400000000003
nobody claimed it is a cause and effect

3938.88 --> 3944.559
relationship establishment

3942.64 --> 3948.68
it is it's science

3944.559 --> 3948.6800000000003
it's a what is

3978.64 --> 3981.64
okay

4014.799 --> 4017.799
what

4020.88 --> 4028.1600000000003
what does that mean john bernard's

4024.559 --> 4028.1600000000003
lunar experiences

4029.68 --> 4034.44
is that another word for a period

4047.92 --> 4050.88
except

4049.599 --> 4052.559
well

4050.88 --> 4057.6400000000003
apparently so

4052.559 --> 4057.6400000000003
apparently that's biology for you

4097.199 --> 4102.639999999999
the black swan argument precipice

4100.319 --> 4104.319
that's a paradox

4102.64 --> 4109.12
yeah

4104.319 --> 4111.52
then danny supposed vet fake dumbass

4109.12 --> 4111.5199999999995
idiot

4111.6 --> 4115.759
don't understand that it's my paradox

4117.12 --> 4121.44
i mean

4118.96 --> 4123.44
how many hundreds of times does it need

4121.44 --> 4126.4
to be explained to you

4123.44 --> 4129.759
before you understand that that

4126.4 --> 4129.759
rebuttal doesn't work

4130.08 --> 4134.4
if you're gonna claim terrestrial

4132.239 --> 4136.3189999999995
refraction which is what you are doing

4134.4 --> 4138.799
whether you realize it or not

4136.319 --> 4141.6
in the face of the black swan argument

4138.799 --> 4144.64
well then you can't have

4141.6 --> 4146.56
your radius value established which is

4144.64 --> 4149.359
an integral part

4146.56 --> 4152.080000000001
of the terrestrial refraction formula so

4149.359 --> 4154.319
you end up with a mathematical

4152.08 --> 4157.359
paradox

4154.319 --> 4160.64
where you need the radius of earth

4157.359 --> 4162.799
to do what you do but you don't have it

4160.64 --> 4165.279
anymore

4162.799 --> 4167.759
because now the horizon is refracted you

4165.279 --> 4170.319
can't use it anymore to establish the

4167.759 --> 4170.319
radius

4171.12 --> 4174.599999999999
so it's over

4175.92 --> 4181.759
one way or the other it's over

4178.719 --> 4183.44
oh the horizons refracted well then you

4181.759 --> 4186.0
don't have a globe earth argument

4183.44 --> 4186.0
anymore

4186.319 --> 4190.64
oh it's not refracted well yeah black

4188.48 --> 4192.4
swan earth is not a globe

4190.64 --> 4195.04
so either

4192.4 --> 4197.679
earth is not a globe or you don't have a

4195.04 --> 4200.0
globe argument anymore you pick which

4197.679 --> 4202.8
one because that's the only two choices

4200.0 --> 4205.8
you have in the face of the black swan

4202.8 --> 4205.8
argument

4220.21 --> 4223.39
[Music]

4244.19 --> 4247.36
[Music]

4250.239 --> 4253.36
oh really have you have you done it

4251.76 --> 4254.719
yourself

4253.36 --> 4256.96
have you done that

4254.719 --> 4260.4800000000005
that's the oh no as far

4256.96 --> 4260.4800000000005
no you haven't you're dumb ass

4260.56 --> 4266.400000000001
can't get to space

4263.52 --> 4270.080000000001
space is fake you can't get there

4266.4 --> 4270.08
to observe this globe earth

4270.8 --> 4275.12
it's not a globe no matter how high up

4272.96 --> 4278.159
you go it's not a globe it's always

4275.12 --> 4281.76
going to be flat always no matter how

4278.159 --> 4284.799999999999
high you go it's always going to be flat

4281.76 --> 4288.320000000001
there is no mystical outer space at a

4284.8 --> 4291.12
vast distance in which you will see

4288.32 --> 4295.5199999999995
down and see this

4291.12 --> 4298.719
little globe in between a black space

4295.52 --> 4302.96
that doesn't happen that part is and

4298.719 --> 4302.96
always will be trickery

4303.52 --> 4308.0
that's how they decided to show you how

4306.8 --> 4311.360000000001
it looks

4308.0 --> 4312.96
in the globe cosmology vision

4311.36 --> 4315.04
that's what they do

4312.96 --> 4316.56
in the movies

4315.04 --> 4319.92
what they do

4316.56 --> 4322.080000000001
they show you supposed photographs of

4319.92 --> 4324.2390000000005
bald earth which are never photographs

4322.08 --> 4327.6
they're always imagery because it's

4324.239 --> 4330.4
photoshopped because it has to be

4327.6 --> 4332.0
because you can't actually show a globe

4330.4 --> 4334.719
with natural

4332.0 --> 4337.199
taken photographs because the earth is

4334.719 --> 4340.719
in the globe it cannot be made to look

4337.199 --> 4343.719
like a globe without editing

4340.719 --> 4343.719
huh

4350.08 --> 4355.44
why don't you ask the professionals the

4352.0 --> 4359.36
one that are actually paid to show you

4355.44 --> 4362.32
that imagery and they will tell you on

4359.36 --> 4365.679
camera we've edited it

4362.32 --> 4368.32
it's photoshopped because it has to be

4365.679 --> 4371.1990000000005
this is information

4368.32 --> 4373.12
from 2015

4371.199 --> 4376.0
seven years ago

4373.12 --> 4379.0
it's been there always it's not been

4376.0 --> 4379.0
retracted

4390.96 --> 4395.92
oh now hey dayton oh hi i have a better

4394.32 --> 4399.12
idea

4395.92 --> 4402.96
why don't we pay for a big flight

4399.12 --> 4405.28
and put all the anti-flat earthers on it

4402.96 --> 4407.44
and then set it straight to the center

4405.28 --> 4408.48
of antarctica

4407.44 --> 4409.44
yeah

4408.48 --> 4411.839999999999
like

4409.44 --> 4415.4
prove your globe

4411.84 --> 4417.04
prove it you're gonna fly straight over

4415.4 --> 4418.08
antarctica

4417.04 --> 4420.56
yeah

4418.08 --> 4422.48
should be no problem maybe a little out

4420.56 --> 4425.120000000001
of contact for a while we should be able

4422.48 --> 4429.36
to fly straight on it's not like you're

4425.12 --> 4430.239
suddenly gonna crash into a wall

4429.36 --> 4431.839999999999
so

4430.239 --> 4434.639999999999
why don't you

4431.84 --> 4436.4800000000005
gamble your life on your proclaimed

4434.64 --> 4438.88
beliefs huh

4436.48 --> 4443.28
gamble your life on that

4438.88 --> 4444.719
should be absolutely no risk whatsoever

4443.28 --> 4448.0
right

4444.719 --> 4449.84
all you need is to just fly over

4448.0 --> 4452.48
antarctica

4449.84 --> 4455.12
there's no risk whatsoever so i'm much

4452.48 --> 4457.599999999999
more for that right

4455.12 --> 4459.76
just have a big plane set it on

4457.6 --> 4462.64
autopilot right or remote control or

4459.76 --> 4466.2390000000005
anything something like that

4462.64 --> 4468.56
and just send it like straight down

4466.239 --> 4470.48
straight down there

4468.56 --> 4472.96
filled up with anti-flat earthers and

4470.48 --> 4474.639999999999
they can all do live streams and

4472.96 --> 4476.64
while they're doing it

4474.64 --> 4478.320000000001
so it can all be shown to the world life

4476.64 --> 4480.08
as they're all like oh this is pretty

4478.32 --> 4484.0
cool

4480.08 --> 4486.32
and then just flat all all connections

4484.0 --> 4490.159
disconnected

4486.32 --> 4490.159
and a bunch of smoke in the distance

4493.44 --> 4497.839999999999
i'd be much more inclined to pay for

4495.44 --> 4497.839999999999
that

4513.44 --> 4521.239
hey gadget inspector don't encourage

4516.719 --> 4521.2390000000005
others to break the law

4528.719 --> 4532.32
just look at your own damn country look

4531.12 --> 4534.719
what

4532.32 --> 4536.32
why would you ever encourage anybody to

4534.719 --> 4539.44
do that when you

4536.32 --> 4541.92
you have the result of that

4539.44 --> 4544.48
right in your own backyard gadget

4541.92 --> 4544.4800000000005
inspector

4544.8 --> 4549.88

things

[Music]

4585.44 --> 4592.239
tony you always get in these endless

4589.04 --> 4596.159
back and forth with these freaks

4592.239 --> 4598.879999999999
every time dude how do you do it

4596.159 --> 4601.92
like why are you so efficient in dealing

4598.88 --> 4606.92
with gammas like that i don't understand

4601.92 --> 4606.92
why you let yourself do that

4624.88 --> 4629.52
no no i'm pretty sure you're lying

4627.44 --> 4631.839999999999
dayton ohio

4629.52 --> 4633.1990000000005
tony is not lying

4631.84 --> 4636.88
he wouldn't

4633.199 --> 4638.4
have any reason to

4636.88 --> 4642.159000000001
you see

4638.4 --> 4643.5199999999995
we can simply be wrong about something

4642.159 --> 4645.199
mixed it up

4643.52 --> 4648.56
be wrong and then we admit it and

4645.199 --> 4650.879999999999
there's no absolutely no problem you see

4648.56 --> 4652.4800000000005
there's no problem because as flat

4650.88 --> 4653.6
earthers

4652.48 --> 4654.5599999999995
we

4653.6 --> 4656.4800000000005
know

4654.56 --> 4658.080000000001
that we're trying to do the right thing

4656.48 --> 4660.5599999999995
trying to figure things out as they

4658.08 --> 4662.4
really are and that we can be mistaken

4660.56 --> 4665.52
and that we can correct the mistake and

4662.4 --> 4667.28
that actual progress is purely dependent

4665.52 --> 4672.0
on the correction

4667.28 --> 4672.0
of actual mistakes when we discover them

4672.239 --> 4676.5599999999995
however for you

4674.719 --> 4679.12
anti-flat earthers

4676.56 --> 4682.2390000000005
it's quite the opposite because you know

4679.12 --> 4682.239
you are defeated

4682.64 --> 4688.08
you don't give up you don't give in you

4685.6 --> 4689.76
can't let go of that pretense that you

4688.08 --> 4691.44
always win

4689.76 --> 4693.84
even though everybody can already see

4691.44 --> 4695.839999999999
that you're quite insane for it

4693.84 --> 4697.679
you can't let it go because you need

4695.84 --> 4702.159000000001
that assertion for yourself that

4697.679 --> 4702.159
delusion to even keep going

4702.239 --> 4708.879999999999
because you know you are now

4704.8 --> 4711.1990000000005
dabbling in a dying religion

4708.88 --> 4713.36
it's gonna go away from you and all that

4711.199 --> 4715.5199999999995
stuff it was protecting you from is

4713.36 --> 4718.239
gonna be shoved in your face at some

4715.52 --> 4719.52
point and there is nothing you can do to

4718.239 --> 4721.678999999999
stop it

4719.52 --> 4723.92
but you can make things worse for

4721.679 --> 4726.2390000000005
yourself

4723.92 --> 4727.679
you can double down some more on that

4726.239 --> 4730.639999999999
which you know

4727.679 --> 4733.28
is an ending cause you can double down

4730.64 --> 4735.84
some more make it worse for yourself ah

4733.28 --> 4738.639999999999
there's always more respect

4735.84 --> 4742.2390000000005
people can lose for you

4738.64 --> 4744.320000000001
so once you double down some more eh

4742.239 --> 4746.839999999999
pull down some more do it

4744.32 --> 4749.12
yeah where you how well you fare over

4746.84 --> 4753.88
time sure you're going to be much

4749.12 --> 4753.88
happier in the near future huh

4782.4 --> 4786.719
it just takes one circumpolar flight to

4784.64 --> 4790.1990000000005
prove you wrong oh well do it then

[ __ ] numbnuts

4791.12 --> 4795.04
dayton

4793.04 --> 4797.44
prove it then

4795.04 --> 4799.36
just do it get in that plane go a

4797.44 --> 4802.0
straight line straight to the south

4799.36 --> 4803.599999999999
straight to the south straight dead on

4802.0 --> 4806.719
to the south

4803.6 --> 4810.0
not skimming past antarctica

4806.719 --> 4813.36
in a loop straight dead to the south go

4810.0 --> 4816.639
go in there get in the plane fly it dead

4813.36 --> 4819.679
on south you go till you crash or you

4816.639 --> 4823.12
get on to the other side go dayton do it

4819.679 --> 4826.0
then do it do it now

4823.12 --> 4829.76
get in that plane and fly dead on south

4826.0 --> 4833.199
get on south straight to the south no

4829.76 --> 4835.52
it's not been done lying scum

4833.199 --> 4838.638999999999
it's a [ __ ] sock

4835.52 --> 4838.639
no it's not been done

4838.96 --> 4843.92
there has been no flight dead on south

it's not been done

zero

4856.08 --> 4864.96
they all just skimmed past it none of

4860.639 --> 4867.96
when went straight dead south zero

they haven't

4897.199 --> 4901.28
they have not

4899.12 --> 4903.36
they don't even know where it is

4901.28 --> 4905.28
nobody knows where it is because nobody

4903.36 --> 4909.04
went there

4905.28 --> 4911.84
nobody's ever been to the dead center

4909.04 --> 4911.84
south pole

4912.4 --> 4918.159
and we might have just put a stick

4914.84 --> 4920.8
somewhere right and be like this is it

4918.159 --> 4922.719
that's just the south pole guys

4920.8 --> 4924.4800000000005
but i bet if you're gonna inquire

4922.719 --> 4925.92
inquire some further you're gonna push

4924.48 --> 4928.08
it maybe throw some money at it they're

4925.92 --> 4929.76
gonna tell you yeah okay it isn't

4928.08 --> 4932.96
actually a

4929.76 --> 4935.6
but it's just like we really wanted to

4932.96 --> 4937.12
just say we were here at the south pole

4935.6 --> 4939.1990000000005
so we could just say look this is a

4937.12 --> 4941.199
south pole i know it isn't the south

4939.199 --> 4943.36
wall it's like way over there nobody's

4941.199 --> 4945.12
ever been there you can't we're not

4943.36 --> 4947.599999999999
allowed to really

4945.12 --> 4950.159
but we just have the south pole over

4947.6 --> 4951.6
here see because we just said it's the

4950.159 --> 4954.48
south ball

4951.6 --> 4957.4400000000005
and where we can do that

4954.48 --> 4959.839999999999
yeah nobody's actually been to the south

over antarctica not a single airplane in

to have gone over the south pole

up doing that yes

it's all lies

have proven that they understand what it

5210.0 --> 5213.44
is

5210.719 --> 5216.639

5346.639 --> 5351.12
it's going to reflect on your character

5348.719 --> 5353.52
oh you think because you were surrounded

5351.12 --> 5354.96
by smarter people one time

5353.52 --> 5356.719
that you could just

5354.96 --> 5358.32
keep a hold of that

5356.719 --> 5360.4
no no

5358.32 --> 5363.12
see your character

5360.4 --> 5366.0
your character level intellect level

because you're going to need it

5389.84 --> 5395.1990000000005
because your your planning abilities and

5392.239 --> 5397.5199999999995
oversight and overall understanding it's

5395.199 --> 5399.36
going to kind of slip away more and more

5397.52 --> 5401.6
over time but you already knew that

5399.36 --> 5403.679
right ignorance is bliss

5401.6 --> 5405.6
you just want that virtual stake in the

5403.679 --> 5407.92
matrix huh

5405.6 --> 5410.92
good for you

5407.92 --> 5410.92

5450.32 --> 5457.92
oh that guy is a real [ __ ] pathetic

5454.719 --> 5460.0
like ass sucking scumbag

5457.92 --> 5462.32
oh we got to promote that one

5460.0 --> 5463.84
because youtube's always looking for a

5462.32 --> 5467.28
monstrous

5463.84 --> 5469.6
filthy low-life scumbags

5467.28 --> 5471.84
especially if they can't help themselves

5469.6 --> 5474.2390000000005
being a scumbag as they are

5471.84 --> 5477.28
to lift them up way to the top because

5474.239 --> 5478.08
that's who they want everybody to see

5477.28 --> 5479.5199999999995
right

5478.08 --> 5482.4
if you're gonna have high numbers

5479.52 --> 5486.2390000000005
somewhere on your media you have to be a

5482.4 --> 5489.12
sick psychotic satanic uncaring

5486.239 --> 5491.5199999999995
manipulative piece of [ __ ]

5489.12 --> 5495.679
then you get all the numbers you want

5491.52 --> 5498.56
why because they want everybody to see

5495.679 --> 5500.2390000000005
only scumbags yeah it's part of the

5498.56 --> 5503.280000000001
programming

5500.239 --> 5505.839999999999
convince the entire world that all

5503.28 --> 5510.08
humans are monsters

5505.84 --> 5512.96
everyone that's popular is a monster

5510.08 --> 5516.4
yeah that's what they want why because

5512.96 --> 5518.8
they want to gradually and slowly

5516.4 --> 5521.44
condition all humans

5518.8 --> 5522.8
that all humans are better

5521.44 --> 5526.599999999999
dead

5522.8 --> 5530.84
that's why they do that that's why the

5526.6 --> 5532.4800000000005
unbelievably gross scumbags proven

5530.84 --> 5534.8
criminals

5532.48 --> 5536.799999999999
anti-human demons

5534.8 --> 5540.2390000000005
lifted up to the top

5536.8 --> 5542.4800000000005
right away like a turd floating

5540.239 --> 5544.32
in the sewer

5542.48 --> 5546.48
yeah yeah yeah yeah because they're the

5544.32 --> 5548.88
scumbags that's what they want you to

5546.48 --> 5551.919999999999
see they want to shove that floating

5548.88 --> 5553.84
turd in your face

5551.92 --> 5556.4
that's why they do it

5553.84 --> 5558.52
that's probably why my channels still

5556.4 --> 5561.28
look

5558.52 --> 5562.56
2.35 5k subs

5561.28 --> 5565.759999999999
because

5562.56 --> 5568.159000000001
i do exactly the opposite of that every

5565.76 --> 5570.8
chance i get

5568.159 --> 5573.28
yeah i get in your face about everything

5570.8 --> 5575.6
they don't want i get aggressive about

5573.28 --> 5578.5599999999995
all the things they don't expect you to

5575.6 --> 5578.56
get aggressive about

5580.0 --> 5586.96
i'm trying to be exactly the opposite of

5582.56 --> 5589.92
what they want in every conceivable way

5586.96 --> 5594.719
and i'm really fanatic about it

5589.92 --> 5596.88
exactly the opposite of what they want

5594.719 --> 5600.56
yeah

5596.88 --> 5601.76
i am their antichrist i am an antichrist

5600.56 --> 5603.92
to them

5601.76 --> 5606.8
to their system

5603.92 --> 5608.4
i am the opposite i do exactly the

5606.8 --> 5610.88
opposite

5608.4 --> 5613.44
yeah in every way

5610.88 --> 5615.679
in every way

5613.44 --> 5618.159
no limits

5615.679 --> 5620.08
oh this is how you think

5618.159 --> 5622.159
you're gonna arrange the world this is

5620.08 --> 5624.5599999999995
the way you wanna maneuver everyone well

5622.159 --> 5627.759999999999
guess what i'm gonna do it exactly the

5624.56 --> 5630.320000000001
opposite every time i'm gonna give that

5627.76 --> 5631.76
extra hard push when everybody's oh no

5630.32 --> 5634.0
oh we gotta be

5631.76 --> 5635.280000000001
oh no none

5634.0 --> 5639.199
aggressive

5635.28 --> 5642.48
oh just be tolerant to this no [ __ ] you

5639.199 --> 5644.719
[ __ ] you the time for tolerance is over

5642.48 --> 5647.28
it's over this is the time to be

5644.719 --> 5650.639
dominant and in your face

5647.28 --> 5651.92
and stop listening to standardized

5650.639 --> 5654.719
narratives

5651.92 --> 5656.32
step away from the standardized

5654.719 --> 5658.4
narrative

5656.32 --> 5660.4
it is the trap

5658.4 --> 5663.5199999999995
they're goading you

5660.4 --> 5665.839999999999
they're goading you like sheep in a pen

5663.52 --> 5668.159000000001
and the pen has been arranged with very

5665.84 --> 5670.56
specific pathways and very specific

5668.159 --> 5672.799999999999
little trixies they know exactly where

5670.56 --> 5674.2390000000005
they're sending you you think oh look

5672.8 --> 5676.4800000000005
there's a special thing right in front

5674.239 --> 5678.799999999999
of me how unique that's like a god sign

5676.48 --> 5680.718999999999
no they put it there they expected this

5678.8 --> 5681.76
to happen

5680.719 --> 5684.08
and they're

5681.76 --> 5686.719
trying to maneuver you in a very

5684.08 --> 5689.76
specific predictable way so that if you

5686.719 --> 5692.08
do that you will after that still be

5689.76 --> 5694.2390000000005
very predictable so they can send you to

5692.08 --> 5699.32
the next phase and then after that the

5694.239 --> 5699.32
next phase and after that the slaughter

5702.639 --> 5709.4400000000005
so i do the opposite and yeah that's

5705.679 --> 5711.76
making me absolutely grounded

5709.44 --> 5715.5199999999995
preventing me from launch i could

5711.76 --> 5717.92
imagine that with my overall attitude

5715.52 --> 5719.040000000001
can you imagine even more money dude i'd

5717.92 --> 5720.4
be

5719.04 --> 5724.239
i could be

5720.4 --> 5726.48
monstrously popular i could be

5724.239 --> 5729.36
but it's not happening they're not

5726.48 --> 5731.839999999999
letting that happen

5729.36 --> 5734.4
because they fear me

5731.84 --> 5734.400000000001
fear me

5735.52 --> 5741.119000000001
because i have no respect for power

5738.56 --> 5743.6
without responsibility i basically have

5741.119 --> 5746.4
no respect for power at all

5743.6 --> 5748.159000000001
i only have respect for responsibility

5746.4 --> 5751.04
in the face of power

5748.159 --> 5752.5599999999995
that's the only thing that i really have

5751.04 --> 5756.719
respect for

5752.56 --> 5758.639
somebody with power is [ __ ] to me

5756.719 --> 5760.32
but if they actually understand the

5758.639 --> 5761.1990000000005
responsibility that comes with that

5760.32 --> 5763.5199999999995
power

5761.199 --> 5765.678999999999
and they focus on that

5763.52 --> 5767.92
and they develop that then i respect

5765.679 --> 5767.92
them

5768.08 --> 5773.199
that's how i do it right so i'm rounding

5770.8 --> 5775.1990000000005
