over the sun right now

97.84 --> 101.84
let's not not continually

102.24 --> 107.19999999999999
and yeah there's there's almost no wind

105.2 --> 114.56
which is really nice

107.2 --> 119.92
makes the sunny moments even more nice

114.56 --> 119.92
feels like it's almost summer almost

127.04 --> 129.28
right

132.55 --> 135.679
[Music]

141.52 --> 143.84
so

148.879 --> 159.92
it's tuesday the 13th of april 2021

156.879 --> 162.239
and today yeah i started a little late

159.92 --> 163.67999999999998
sorry about that but i wanted to kind of

162.239 --> 165.84
take my time

163.68 --> 166.72
not hurry into starting perfectly on

165.84 --> 169.84
time it could have

166.72 --> 172.16
i did some groceries right before but

169.84 --> 173.04
also because nathan is not doing a live

172.16 --> 176.16
show today

173.04 --> 178.72
because his youngest daughter is having

176.16 --> 180.319
her birthday second birthday

178.72 --> 182.8
so there's not gonna be a live flat

180.319 --> 185.11999999999998
earth debates and i think

182.8 --> 186.239
i'm going to do a longer show than usual

185.12 --> 189.519
because of it

186.239 --> 190.0
i do feel like it i got some good energy

189.519 --> 192.159
again

190.0 --> 195.12
went to bed extremely early this time

192.159 --> 198.72
even before 12 o'clock

195.12 --> 202.159
and it's doing me a lot of good like

198.72 --> 206.239
did i mention it wow

202.159 --> 207.44
yeah i hadn't really noticed before but

206.239 --> 213.84
it seems like my

207.44 --> 213.84
shoulder pain is now entirely gone

214.159 --> 219.519
it had kind of like dropped slowly but

217.36 --> 224.72000000000003
now i feel like yeah i do have like

219.519 --> 228.56
remnant sore muscle tension

224.72 --> 230.959
a little but the real

228.56 --> 233.68
place where it would seem to be somewhat

230.959 --> 237.36
inflamed over a period

233.68 --> 241.84
last few weeks it seems that finally

237.36 --> 241.84
completely subsided

242.0 --> 248.239
very happy about that because it was a

245.599 --> 248.23899999999998
real burden

250.72 --> 257.68
right so because i'm waiting for people

254.64 --> 257.68
to drop in chat

258.639 --> 261.199
let's see

261.339 --> 264.379
[Music]

266.84 --> 270.71999999999997
right okay let's

278.72 --> 282.0
right yeah yesterday hey hello brendam

281.6 --> 285.68
good to

282.0 --> 287.68
see you first in chat yesterday after

285.68 --> 289.04
the early bird show and it was a good

287.68 --> 292.08
early bird show i thought

289.04 --> 293.91900000000004
didn't watch it back but it still it

292.08 --> 296.32
felt good and hope today is going to be

293.919 --> 300.639
just as good a show

296.32 --> 304.56
nice and fluid no tense

300.639 --> 306.16
stand by moments so i sometimes have a

304.56 --> 309.199
lot

306.16 --> 312.56
but i'm gonna try to do my best again to

309.199 --> 312.56
make that not happen today

313.68 --> 319.039
flat earth debate was also very

316.32 --> 319.039
entertaining

323.68 --> 326.88
right there's still a lot by the way

325.919 --> 329.039
going on

326.88 --> 330.24
back and forth with ballers and

329.039 --> 333.68
seriously the guys

330.24 --> 336.8
in chat are like constantly at it

333.68 --> 340.08
seems like for example flat side now

336.8 --> 340.08
has officially

342.4 --> 348.0
got a copyright strike from mr sensible

345.36 --> 348.0
and it's

348.16 --> 357.28000000000003
it's annoying

353.68 --> 360.88
but mr sensitive is seemingly getting

357.28 --> 363.039
extra gamma these days and trying to

360.88 --> 365.68
take down flat earthers

363.039 --> 366.15999999999997
even that make response videos to his

365.68 --> 370.56
stuff

366.16 --> 374.8
now it's quite pathetic

370.56 --> 374.8
right so these things keep on going

375.52 --> 377.84
right

379.039 --> 382.15999999999997
yeah a tea time with gary and terry was

381.12 --> 385.52
also live

382.16 --> 387.84000000000003
i didn't miss a part of it

385.52 --> 389.19899999999996
but then again i watched this morning to

387.84 --> 392.15999999999997
kind of

389.199 --> 393.36
watch the part that i missed yesterday

392.16 --> 396.0
live

393.36 --> 397.52000000000004
and yeah he had a really great show too

396.0 --> 401.52
very

397.52 --> 406.31899999999996
very funny and informative uh hey

401.52 --> 409.84
dutch sailor agm turret 306

406.319 --> 412.08000000000004
good to see you all

409.84 --> 413.52
right it was funny uh yeah i mean it

412.08 --> 415.35999999999996
made a small note

413.52 --> 418.4
and i wonder if he's gonna pick up on

415.36 --> 421.28000000000003
this somehow so if there's any bears

418.4 --> 422.63899999999995
that also have access to like his live

421.28 --> 425.67999999999995
chats

422.639 --> 428.88
uh i'd like to convey a tip

425.68 --> 432.08
because uh the big bear

428.88 --> 432.479
said he had ant issues and he was gonna

432.08 --> 436.0
try

432.479 --> 440.0
like a a bucket of sugar

436.0 --> 441.919
with what was it again with borax

440.0 --> 444.96
that seems to be a trick well i know

441.919 --> 448.639
through somebody else

444.96 --> 451.28
rasta hat i hope he doesn't mind me

448.639 --> 452.88
conveying this little trick but there's

451.28 --> 456.23999999999995
another way you can also

452.88 --> 458.08
very effectively keep out ants

456.24 --> 459.44
and because he's used that and that is

458.08 --> 462.479
by using

459.44 --> 465.36
cinnamon if you put out

462.479 --> 466.96
like a layer of cinnamon and cinnamon is

465.36 --> 470.319
not hard to get

466.96 --> 473.52
it's not that expensive yeah ants

470.319 --> 475.12
don't touch that stuff and it's not

473.52 --> 478.479
super poisonous

475.12 --> 482.08
it's not bad you just like if you get

478.479 --> 485.84
a huge bucket of cinnamon

482.08 --> 491.919
you could basically keep you can

485.84 --> 493.84
like create borders for ants with them

491.919 --> 497.12
right it doesn't exterminate them

493.84 --> 498.56
but it can very effectively help barter

497.12 --> 500.8
them off

498.56 --> 502.72
every single time and they don't adapt

500.8 --> 507.599
so that would be pretty cool

502.72 --> 509.91900000000004
if somebody could relay that message

507.599 --> 512.0
rasta hat has tested it out several

509.919 --> 512.7189999999999
times it worked every time and it's

512.0 --> 516.32
super cheap

512.719 --> 518.8000000000001
it's non-poisonous so yeah

516.32 --> 520.88
that might be a good tip for the big

518.8 --> 521.8389999999999
bear i hope somebody passes on the

520.88 --> 525.2
message

521.839 --> 526.32
or god forbid he'd actually watch my

525.2 --> 529.839
show

526.32 --> 532.9590000000001
that's a good one although maybe

529.839 --> 534.0
maybe he does you know maybe he still

532.959 --> 537.68
does that

534.0 --> 539.519
nah no way like

537.68 --> 541.68
we'll be very early he'd probably he's

539.519 --> 542.5600000000001
probably like goat milking right now or

541.68 --> 545.04
something

542.56 --> 545.92
and he's not gonna listen to his stream

545.04 --> 550.7199999999999
while

545.92 --> 552.3199999999999
actually attending to his animals

550.72 --> 553.839
i doubt it but maybe maybe i'm

552.32 --> 558.24
completely wrong man but

553.839 --> 558.24
no no no come on who am i

558.88 --> 565.12
but anyway that was a tip hope somebody

562.24 --> 565.12
passes it on

565.68 --> 568.0
uh

569.279 --> 576.88
right uh

573.839 --> 579.2790000000001
yeah brandon also went live but i didn't

576.88 --> 579.279
watch it

579.92 --> 585.1999999999999
i just on passing by heard that rumpus

583.44 --> 586.6400000000001
got in there again he he likes to hang

585.2 --> 590.24
around there

586.64 --> 593.279
rompers and ed and typical ballers

590.24 --> 596.64
right anyway hello cameron kamikaze

593.279 --> 596.64
gilmore good to see you

598.16 --> 609.12
so uh

605.6 --> 609.12
oh yeah almost forgot

609.92 --> 615.279
i watched new earth's video

616.24 --> 621.519
that she uploaded somewhere last night

619.279 --> 623.12
i didn't watch it live oh it is not live

621.519 --> 624.48
she only uploads he doesn't do live

623.12 --> 627.76
streams

624.48 --> 627.76
but that was interesting

631.76 --> 636.0
typical ballers well the trenches if you

634.72 --> 638.32
want to

636.0 --> 640.8
make me say it more correctly tiny

638.32 --> 646.6400000000001
womble don't be so

640.8 --> 648.0
so long toad about it hello anthem splat

646.64 --> 650.24
earth

648.0 --> 650.24
no

653.12 --> 656.8
right so there is no flat earth debate

655.44 --> 659.519
live today

656.8 --> 662.399
he's prob nathan's probably gonna put on

659.519 --> 665.6
every stream of something

662.399 --> 668.72
but i intend to do a longer show maybe

665.6 --> 671.36
even get some flatter debaters on here

668.72 --> 674.399
with me if they want to maybe they've

671.36 --> 677.12
all taken the day off

674.399 --> 677.12
i don't know yet

681.839 --> 689.839
alright let's see

696.24 --> 701.6800000000001
things that i've been thinking about

699.68 --> 703.5999999999999
yeah well yeah watch the new earth video

701.68 --> 707.8389999999999
then went out for groceries

703.6 --> 707.839
and like that stuff really sticks

708.0 --> 711.519
like she has her own

712.24 --> 718.72
cosmology like spiritual cosmology ideas

715.36 --> 719.44
with very much with with the idea of

718.72 --> 722.72
christ

719.44 --> 722.72
but from the

724.16 --> 730.959
more of an esoteric fashion and i

728.16 --> 733.1999999999999
i think it's tough i've never like

730.959 --> 735.279
communicated with her right i've never

733.2 --> 736.8000000000001
she's never been open for direct

735.279 --> 739.76
communication

736.8 --> 743.04
she's not a debater and she's i don't

739.76 --> 746.16
think she's even a flat earther

743.04 --> 749.4399999999999
but like her interpretation of like

746.16 --> 753.12
uh the flow chart

749.44 --> 756.0
of the end times is very interesting

753.12 --> 758.5600000000001
and it does definitely parallel other

756.0 --> 761.839
things that i've seen from more

758.56 --> 764.079
exoteric biblical christians

761.839 --> 764.9590000000001
and it's just interesting how she fills

764.079 --> 767.92
it in with

764.959 --> 768.3199999999999
several individuals and also a lot of

767.92 --> 771.04
talk

768.32 --> 772.399
just about like the different

771.04 --> 775.4399999999999
incarnations how

772.399 --> 779.44
basically the dream

775.44 --> 781.2
reality is yeah she takes this position

779.44 --> 782.639
that the dream reality is the real

781.2 --> 785.0400000000001
reality and this is like

782.639 --> 787.2
the test the physical reality is the

785.04 --> 789.68
test

787.2 --> 791.519
and yeah to a certain extent i i may

789.68 --> 794.8
agree with that

791.519 --> 798.8
but then again on this at the same time

794.8 --> 803.04
i take in a position where i do

798.8 --> 806.399
take this life what we do

803.04 --> 806.399
as very important

810.079 --> 813.3599999999999
like just because you have this

811.839 --> 816.5600000000001
knowledge

813.36 --> 817.44
it might and that's lucifer seduce you

816.56 --> 819.92
to basically

817.44 --> 821.519
say okay earthly existence doesn't

819.92 --> 824.56
really matter

821.519 --> 827.68
as long as you know the right things

824.56 --> 831.279
and all that and i

827.68 --> 834.7199999999999
i instinctively tried to step

831.279 --> 837.92
away from that because

834.72 --> 838.88
i kind of before i became more

837.92 --> 842.0
insightful

838.88 --> 845.519
more accepting of the esoteric things

842.0 --> 848.8
that i picked up on when i was younger

845.519 --> 850.48
before i picked up before i before that

848.8 --> 854.959
all sank in

850.48 --> 857.36
i was i had very much that attitude

854.959 --> 860.7199999999999
namely like this this doesn't mean

857.36 --> 864.0
anything it's just a temporary thing and

860.72 --> 867.12
typical i guess adolescent type of

864.0 --> 870.0
responses with that not good

867.12 --> 871.839
and it got me into trouble like people

870.0 --> 875.76
abuse that

871.839 --> 878.0
like they abused my sense

875.76 --> 879.6
or i let them as a matter of perspective

878.0 --> 881.6
i guess i let them

879.6 --> 883.12
abuse my sense that it isn't didn't

881.6 --> 886.0
really matter

883.12 --> 888.48
like because i just kind of like tried

886.0 --> 890.72
to relinquish my earthly cares

888.48 --> 893.839
even for survival and money and just

890.72 --> 895.6800000000001
wanting to go with the energy

893.839 --> 899.44
while there were plenty of gravelers

895.68 --> 902.16
around and i just

899.44 --> 902.1600000000001
it made me

908.0 --> 914.8
made me let that happen a lot of it

911.36 --> 917.6
and just like from the perspective

914.8 --> 919.4399999999999
of like okay these are their earthly

917.6 --> 920.24
things that they hold on to and they're

919.44 --> 923.6800000000001
not gonna

920.24 --> 926.0
stop that anyway so since

923.68 --> 926.8
it could potentially be the last time

926.0 --> 930.399
that they

926.8 --> 933.3599999999999
exist their spirits like

930.399 --> 934.72
this is this crazy thinking right i

933.36 --> 938.16
thought

934.72 --> 940.0790000000001
i they deserve to have some joy within

938.16 --> 942.88
that stupid choice

940.079 --> 945.519
before they go right that's how i

942.88 --> 945.519
thought it's

946.399 --> 950.959
and now i realize like how stupid that

952.839 --> 955.839
was

956.48 --> 962.399
am i is anybody following that what i

959.6 --> 965.9200000000001
just described

962.399 --> 969.44
has anybody ever experienced that that

965.92 --> 972.24
you gain like a lot of insight on

969.44 --> 972.24
esoterics

972.56 --> 977.04
and then you think like oh okay well

975.12 --> 979.199
that makes sense then that makes sense

977.04 --> 980.88
in who i am and makes sense in who they

979.199 --> 985.8389999999999
are and why they're so

980.88 --> 989.759
messed up and like yeah i don't want to

985.839 --> 991.6800000000001
deprive them more of some remnant joy

989.759 --> 992.9590000000001
that it might experience before they

991.68 --> 997.12
basically

992.959 --> 1003.279
exit to a not so good place

997.12 --> 1003.279
that was like it's like a crazy form of

1003.6 --> 1011.6
neutral liberalism like not i wasn't

1006.639 --> 1013.6800000000001
for them at all i just was so convinced

1011.6 --> 1015.36
that like there's nothing they can do

1013.68 --> 1019.12
right there's nothing they can do

1015.36 --> 1022.839
in their rebellion to stop like

1019.12 --> 1025.439
the way creation is so i would

1022.839 --> 1027.52
basically in retrospect kind of like

1025.439 --> 1029.1200000000001
take on a little god attitude and be

1027.52 --> 1032.319
like oh

1029.12 --> 1036.2399999999998
okay we'll give them

1032.319 --> 1036.24
something right

1036.319 --> 1044.48
and it's so stupid i think

1039.839 --> 1044.48
it i don't like that i did that now

1047.28 --> 1053.76
right uh tara 306 are you a

1050.84 --> 1057.12
transcendental

1053.76 --> 1062.0
uh i almost ran red

1057.12 --> 1062.0
are you a trans dentist but

1062.72 --> 1068.48
what is a transcendentalist a i fakely

1066.4 --> 1069.6000000000001
remember that terminology i don't know

1068.48 --> 1081.84
what it means

1069.6 --> 1081.84
let me look it up

1088.51 --> 1093.41
[Music]

1106.84 --> 1112.32
okay

1108.88 --> 1112.3200000000002
philosophical movement

1114.24 --> 1118.96
right inherent goodness of people and

1120.84 --> 1123.84
nature

1129.6 --> 1132.0
well

1135.36 --> 1143.76
subjective for an objective empiricism

1139.52 --> 1145.6
oh i don't agree with that part

1143.76 --> 1146.799
a lot of what i'm reading here sounds

1145.6 --> 1149.1999999999998
kind of familiar

1146.799 --> 1150.16
but here it says transcendentalism

1149.2 --> 1155.8400000000001
emphasizes

1150.16 --> 1155.8400000000001
subjective intuition over empiricism

1156.0 --> 1159.2
i wouldn't say that

1162.84 --> 1165.84
right

1168.16 --> 1174.4
although a lot of the times

1171.28 --> 1176.6399999999999
my subjective intuition does kind of

1174.4 --> 1176.64
like

1176.84 --> 1181.52
surpass basic empiricism like a literal

1181.12 --> 1184.559
thing

1181.52 --> 1188.8799999999999
in the moment but look

1184.559 --> 1192.08
empiricism is really there to

1188.88 --> 1194.24
distinguish the mechanics

1192.08 --> 1196.96
of the real from the mc the fake

1194.24 --> 1200.559
mechanics the conceptual mechanics so

1196.96 --> 1203.6000000000001
yeah that part

1200.559 --> 1204.32
i definitely don't agree with to say

1203.6 --> 1207.76
that

1204.32 --> 1211.36
subjective intuition is more important

1207.76 --> 1215.2
than objective empiricism

1211.36 --> 1218.799
right but i might

1215.2 --> 1220.0
be taking that understanding as it is

1218.799 --> 1221.84
phrased here out of

1220.0 --> 1223.679
its context right it might not be

1221.84 --> 1227.12
emphasizing so much

1223.679 --> 1235.8400000000001
um physical reality it's

1227.12 --> 1235.84
philosophical natured after all so

1259.2 --> 1263.8400000000001
right it's

1265.919 --> 1274.48
besides the basics basic vantage point

1271.44 --> 1276.48
what i read here i i don't really

1274.48 --> 1278.32
nothing about this or any of these

1276.48 --> 1281.1200000000001
people

1278.32 --> 1281.12
that are shown

1281.76 --> 1291.84
ring any bells of some kind so yeah i

1284.96 --> 1291.8400000000001
don't know

1296.559 --> 1305.84
hmm anyway you think there's more than

1299.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
what's told by modern modern science

1307.36 --> 1309.6
no

1312.88 --> 1321.6000000000001
what does that even mean modern science

1318.799 --> 1322.48
right there's so many things that are

1321.6 --> 1327.12
tested

1322.48 --> 1330.84
figured out that nobody agrees on

1327.12 --> 1334.0
right so there's a lot of empiric

1330.84 --> 1334.48
data that people just refuse to agree

1334.0 --> 1337.52
upon

1334.48 --> 1337.52
they they refuse

1341.52 --> 1347.679
right if that makes that transcendental

1345.2 --> 1348.559
if that is this the core aspect the

1347.679 --> 1352.0
ignoring

1348.559 --> 1354.799
of physical proof over some kind of

1352.0 --> 1358.799
virtual structure that is part of the

1354.799 --> 1358.799
belief then i'm definitely not a

1358.84 --> 1363.12
transcendentalist

1360.08 --> 1366.48
ether what ether

1363.12 --> 1367.36
if there's a concept hello i'm andy

1366.48 --> 1370.799
young

1367.36 --> 1375.84
good to see you one of my funny flatters

1370.799 --> 1375.84
what kind of a question is that

1378.88 --> 1385.679
what are my funny flattered beliefs

1381.919 --> 1386.64
is what didn't expect a question from

1385.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
you

1386.64 --> 1389.8400000000001
like that

1397.76 --> 1403.84
hello mouth eyes

1406.74 --> 1409.94
[Music]

1428.84 --> 1431.84
hmm

1439.76 --> 1446.32
like you think there's a dome

1442.88 --> 1448.7990000000002
nope i think that there is a limited

1446.32 --> 1448.799
volume

1449.919 --> 1454.5590000000002
the dome implies a specific type of

1453.44 --> 1459.8400000000001
geometry

1454.559 --> 1459.84
in some fashion right

1460.88 --> 1465.2
it implies a physical structure

1465.919 --> 1473.8400000000001
hold on

1482.64 --> 1489.8400000000001
uh more land well

1486.72 --> 1492.32
there's probably at least at least

1489.84 --> 1493.36
a little more land also there might

1492.32 --> 1496.72
potentially be

1493.36 --> 1500.24
a lot more land beneath

1496.72 --> 1503.76
this like a sub-realm

1500.24 --> 1505.679
jail as it's called in the the jewish

1503.76 --> 1508.64
cosmology i think

1505.679 --> 1510.5590000000002
right that may exist and with the

1508.64 --> 1512.7990000000002
knowledge of the holographic nature of

1510.559 --> 1515.44
the heavens

1512.799 --> 1516.96
those things are sort of possible right

1515.44 --> 1519.76
because it's not going to be

1516.96 --> 1522.24
just a dark realm there may be like

1519.76 --> 1526.48
their own they may have their own light

1522.24 --> 1526.48
apparitions probably different

1527.36 --> 1533.4399999999998
but yeah there's even stories about this

1531.279 --> 1535.52
about how the inner earth has

1533.44 --> 1538.88
like instead of a sun it has like a

1535.52 --> 1541.76
weird light emanating cloud

1538.88 --> 1542.0800000000002
it's very odd right i think that these

1541.76 --> 1546.32
things

1542.08 --> 1549.52
are viable viable possibilities

1546.32 --> 1550.559
as for like more land beyond the little

1549.52 --> 1553.52
bit

1550.559 --> 1556.24
like to the south potentially and

1553.52 --> 1559.84
potentially even more beneath us

1556.24 --> 1560.32
yes there may be more land segments but

1559.84 --> 1564.24
these

1560.32 --> 1567.36
this i like to talk about that

1564.24 --> 1569.279
as a potential option because also it is

1567.36 --> 1572.4799999999998
very important for the understanding of

1569.279 --> 1573.44
the spatial non-linearity element that

1572.48 --> 1577.919
may be

1573.44 --> 1577.919
an integral part of the realms layout

1578.4 --> 1584.159
but i also very much internally

1581.84 --> 1585.279
recognize that there may simply not be

1584.159 --> 1588.3200000000002
there

1585.279 --> 1588.32
it may simply not

1588.4 --> 1595.3600000000001
right and even the

1592.159 --> 1598.5590000000002
square earth cosmology channel

1595.36 --> 1599.4399999999998
their animations they don't they don't

1598.559 --> 1602.559
have this they

1599.44 --> 1603.6000000000001
just say no there is a barrier just a

1602.559 --> 1606.48
flat barrier

1603.6 --> 1606.48
north and south

1608.799 --> 1612.0
so it's like a tunnel a looping tunnel

1611.36 --> 1615.4399999999998
like the train

1612.0 --> 1615.44
man station from the matrix

1616.32 --> 1623.039
so it could that could be it

1619.44 --> 1626.4
it could also be that still there is

1623.039 --> 1629.039
more land beyond or maybe like i've even

1626.4 --> 1632.799
suggested during some of my hangouts

1629.039 --> 1634.96
the barrier or the loop may shift

1632.799 --> 1636.72
under certain conditions it might be

1634.96 --> 1640.24
flexible

1636.72 --> 1643.52
right so these are the things that i

1640.24 --> 1644.96
talk about but i don't

1643.52 --> 1647.36
regard any of them as like

1644.96 --> 1650.559
fundamentalist beliefs these are just

1647.36 --> 1653.279
mechanical possibilities with

1650.559 --> 1656.399
personal sizing up of percentage of

1653.279 --> 1656.399
likelihood as it were

1666.84 --> 1670.9599999999998
right

1668.399 --> 1670.9599999999998
now what

1673.29 --> 1676.43
[Music]

1678.559 --> 1681.6789999999999
bill casey you want to look this dude

1680.799 --> 1684.8799999999999
nathan r

1681.679 --> 1687.3600000000001
all of you bill gates that shit's been

1684.88 --> 1691.0390000000002
out there for over 10 years

1687.36 --> 1693.039
over 10 years like i remember freaking

1691.039 --> 1696.24
bill gates talking about that [ __ ]

1693.039 --> 1699.2
in the late 90s

1696.24 --> 1701.6
or maybe that was dark world vision of

1699.2 --> 1704.88
future

1701.6 --> 1707.52
but i knew bill gates was like bad news

1704.88 --> 1709.7600000000002
for a long long time

1707.52 --> 1712.8799999999999
i also knew there was absolutely nothing

1709.76 --> 1712.8799999999999
i could ever do about it

1716.08 --> 1721.279
like if anything he is one of these

1717.76 --> 1721.279
people that is going to exit

1721.36 --> 1726.1589999999999
right also by the way i have been

1724.88 --> 1728.159
thinking again about

1726.159 --> 1730.64
my conversation with flat earth data on

1728.159 --> 1730.64
saturday

1730.88 --> 1742.0800000000002
microsoft is more than nonsense

1738.559 --> 1742.08
it's just a software company

1745.36 --> 1748.559
the matrix they scorch this guy yeah i

1747.52 --> 1752.48
know i know

1748.559 --> 1755.52
right but yeah geoengineering has been

1752.48 --> 1756.799
happening since 1995.

1755.52 --> 1759.44
that's when they first started the

1756.799 --> 1759.44
chemtrails

1760.08 --> 1766.1589999999999
now they may have transitioned that

1763.679 --> 1766.96
those substances into a less damaging

1766.159 --> 1769.98
substance

1766.96 --> 1773.059
i don't know for sure

1769.98 --> 1773.059
[Music]

1775.12 --> 1781.84
in authority right in authority

1779.12 --> 1781.84
no

1782.799 --> 1791.679
no he has he's puppeting the system

1788.48 --> 1794.3990000000001
through finance and corporate control

1791.679 --> 1795.1200000000001
he doesn't actually have the authority

1794.399 --> 1798.6399999999999
that's

1795.12 --> 1801.6789999999999
that's part of the image that he's

1798.64 --> 1804.48
bought right he's bought

1801.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
apparent authority he doesn't actually

1804.48 --> 1809.84
have any

1820.64 --> 1826.96
geo engineers going no not really

1825.279 --> 1828.48
yeah they've been testing that [ __ ]

1826.96 --> 1831.3600000000001
forever like since

1828.48 --> 1833.3600000000001
world war ii yeah geoengineering

1831.36 --> 1833.76
experiments have happened for a long

1833.36 --> 1836.799
time

1833.76 --> 1838.32
right that that much is sure

1836.799 --> 1840.32
doesn't mean that that's when they

1838.32 --> 1842.6399999999999
started to unroll the program that was

1840.32 --> 1846.399
in 1995 that's when they started to

1842.64 --> 1849.279
chemtrail like everywhere

1846.399 --> 1850.0
in europe in the united states and

1849.279 --> 1852.559
potentially

1850.0 --> 1852.559
beyond

1855.679 --> 1864.3300000000002
but that's when they started to really

1857.6 --> 1866.799
unroll the program

1864.33 --> 1869.6789999999999
[Music]

1866.799 --> 1870.72
i'm not talking about tactical weather

1869.679 --> 1872.64
manipulation

1870.72 --> 1875.039
that's something else yeah that's been

1872.64 --> 1878.3200000000002
happening for almost a century

1875.039 --> 1882.48
yeah i know that's not the same thing as

1878.32 --> 1882.48
a worldwide geoengineering program

1882.72 --> 1886.96
that has now for some time been just

1885.679 --> 1890.5590000000002
admitted

1886.96 --> 1894.08
right that one actually started in 95

1890.559 --> 1895.84
that's when they started it's also when

1894.08 --> 1898.559
i started to see it

1895.84 --> 1898.559
in the sky

1899.279 --> 1906.159
before that even in the

1902.96 --> 1908.64
the 80s late 80s i saw a couple of

1906.159 --> 1910.24
trails and it worried a lot of people

1908.64 --> 1913.039
when that happened because that was not

1910.24 --> 1914.559
a common sight and they probably did do

1913.039 --> 1918.1589999999999
some chemical [ __ ]

1914.559 --> 1920.8799999999999
back then right that's different that's

1918.159 --> 1921.8400000000001
not a standardized geoengineering

1920.88 --> 1924.0800000000002
program

1921.84 --> 1926.24
you gotta keep these things apart people

1924.08 --> 1928.96
it's not the same thing

1926.24 --> 1930.159
the significance is very important to

1928.96 --> 1932.48
know the difference

1930.159 --> 1934.96
right if you're just gonna say yeah they

1932.48 --> 1936.24
didn't always they always did it it's

1934.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
always

1936.24 --> 1949.84
[ __ ] [ __ ] be specific

1951.039 --> 1957.519
but yes bill gates is returning with

1954.24 --> 1959.679
the articles and videos of him

1957.519 --> 1960.559
blocking out the sun because he is a

1959.679 --> 1962.88
piece of [ __ ]

1960.559 --> 1964.6399999999999
and he wants everybody to fear him he

1962.88 --> 1967.7600000000002
wants to be the little god

1964.64 --> 1968.24
that everybody trembles for and will go

1967.76 --> 1971.6
into

1968.24 --> 1973.279
auto pilot for and be consumed by the

1971.6 --> 1977.84
beast system that's what he's trying to

1973.279 --> 1977.84
do with that

1981.76 --> 1991.84
what it is different what are what are

1984.08 --> 1991.84
you talking about moth eyes

2003.039 --> 2010.559
same idea yeah that's because

2006.32 --> 2015.4399999999998
it's been suggested for a very long time

2010.559 --> 2015.44
bill gates think tank [ __ ]

2015.519 --> 2022.08
has been out there for a long

2018.559 --> 2025.279
time long time

2022.08 --> 2028.559
it's not new you get it it's not

2025.279 --> 2032.95
new it's not new it's not

2028.559 --> 2036.059
new it's been out for a long time

2032.95 --> 2036.059
[Music]

2044.32 --> 2050.48
right articles news articles

2047.84 --> 2052.879
with bill gates saying that he was gonna

2050.48 --> 2056.879
block the sun

2052.879 --> 2058.879
that was out probably like 20 years ago

2056.879 --> 2060.96
at least 10 years ago and it keeps on

2058.879 --> 2062.399
coming back keeps on being brought forth

2060.96 --> 2065.359
look

2062.399 --> 2067.2799999999997
this is what he wanted to do and again

2065.359 --> 2068.399
oh look this is what he wanted to do

2067.28 --> 2072.159
yeah we know

2068.399 --> 2072.159
it's been out for like 20 years

2073.359 --> 2081.7599999999998
like i remember seeing that [ __ ] in

2076.399 --> 2081.7599999999998
school okay and that's like before 2000.

2081.839 --> 2085.919
could be the like the jesuit guy told me

2084.32 --> 2087.28
or something he told me a lot of [ __ ]

2085.919 --> 2090.879
up [ __ ] about the future

2087.28 --> 2093.599
with glee so

2090.879 --> 2095.1189999999997
don't know if i actually saw it on tv or

2093.599 --> 2097.6800000000003
read it in the newspaper

2095.119 --> 2100.56
it might have just been told to me but

2097.68 --> 2102.72
yeah i know i know he's gonna do that

2100.56 --> 2105.52
yeah he's gonna try that he's he's going

2102.72 --> 2107.839
to try to actually block out the sun

2105.52 --> 2110.32
we may actually see a literal attempt

2107.839 --> 2111.92
where he's gonna try to create ragnarok

2110.32 --> 2115.76
it's gonna cause havoc

2111.92 --> 2119.2000000000003
but then again that could be

2115.76 --> 2119.2000000000003
undone right now

2120.32 --> 2124.0
it can be not necessarily prevented it

2123.359 --> 2127.52
could be

2124.0 --> 2129.44
undone quickly right this is not the

2127.52 --> 2132.32
medieval times

2129.44 --> 2132.32
we got stuff

2138.88 --> 2142.079
i think that if bill gates would

2140.72 --> 2144.56
actually like unroll

2142.079 --> 2146.4
super heavy cloud cedars and literally

2144.56 --> 2149.839
block out the sun everywhere we

2146.4 --> 2152.1600000000003
could undo that afterwards

2149.839 --> 2153.119
after it's been done i think that is

2152.16 --> 2156.64
possible

2153.119 --> 2160.56
if we're not all stopped if they're not

2156.64 --> 2162.48
literally just wanting everybody to go

2160.56 --> 2164.88
berserk and try to

2162.48 --> 2165.839
manage to stop that and then they stop

2164.88 --> 2169.2000000000003
it

2165.839 --> 2172.24
even if it would cause their own death

2169.2 --> 2175.2799999999997
right that's the risk

2172.24 --> 2178.3199999999997
that is the risk right

2175.28 --> 2179.599
we could stop it if we could get that

2178.32 --> 2182.88
far

2179.599 --> 2186.1600000000003
if we could get basically enough

2182.88 --> 2188.56
tech technology government

2186.16 --> 2190.72
enough people enough military on that

2188.56 --> 2191.839
side in order to stop it because they

2190.72 --> 2195.1189999999997
will prevent

2191.839 --> 2195.119
you from stopping it

2197.119 --> 2205.6800000000003
the earth will heal itself yeah

2201.44 --> 2205.68
sure eventually

2211.359 --> 2215.2799999999997
if it's god's plan there's nothing to

2212.88 --> 2216.6400000000003
worry about no no that's exactly not how

2215.28 --> 2219.76
it works

2216.64 --> 2220.48
right that's not how it works unless you

2219.76 --> 2223.3590000000004
are just

2220.48 --> 2224.8
willing to like okay sure evil wins

2223.359 --> 2228.16
everybody dies

2224.8 --> 2230.96
if that is if that is what you think is

2228.16 --> 2232.24
like supposed to happen without you

2230.96 --> 2234.88
doing anything about it

2232.24 --> 2234.8799999999997
then yeah

2236.24 --> 2243.839
i don't think that's god's plan

2254.839 --> 2257.839
one

2261.2 --> 2267.5989999999997
right but technically

2264.48 --> 2270.64
i think sounds

2267.599 --> 2271.76
maybe maybe it sounds too easy but i

2270.64 --> 2275.04
think that

2271.76 --> 2278.48
potentially what could be done

2275.04 --> 2280.079
if they actually seed like like ensure

2278.48 --> 2281.839
that the sun never comes through create

2280.079 --> 2283.599
another arachnoid we could undo it

2281.839 --> 2286.7999999999997
through argon generators

2283.599 --> 2290.96
massive amounts of them and huge ones

2286.8 --> 2290.96
like huge argon pillars

2291.52 --> 2299.119
right that could literally

2296.0 --> 2301.359
disperse it all

2299.119 --> 2304.1600000000003
quickly like even if they keep pumping

2301.359 --> 2307.7599999999998
it out it could work

2304.16 --> 2310.24
and yeah you don't even need to

2307.76 --> 2310.88
you don't even need any heavy technology

2310.24 --> 2313.68
for that

2310.88 --> 2314.48
you don't need any like military related

2313.68 --> 2318.0
technology

2314.48 --> 2319.76
even to do that just some basic

2318.0 --> 2321.52
materials

2319.76 --> 2327.8390000000004
it's just that a lot of people would

2321.52 --> 2327.839
have to do that

2332.24 --> 2341.839
god damn it [ __ ] off

2351.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
shut up guys this is stupid

2374.72 --> 2379.04
right i don't see why you're all so

2378.0 --> 2382.16
worried about this

2379.04 --> 2385.52
it's like why are you looking

2382.16 --> 2387.359
for an edge of the abyss to peer over

2385.52 --> 2389.7599999999998
why don't you see that there's still

2387.359 --> 2392.88
just a lot

2389.76 --> 2394.88
that can be done you don't have to

2392.88 --> 2396.079
walk up to the edge of the abyss to

2394.88 --> 2397.839
stare at it

2396.079 --> 2399.44
right you don't need to do that you

2397.839 --> 2403.92
don't need to envision

2399.44 --> 2406.64
doom that's what they want you to do

2403.92 --> 2407.6800000000003
that's part of the spell that's why they

2406.64 --> 2409.5989999999997
do that

2407.68 --> 2411.9199999999996
that's why they constantly pump out

2409.599 --> 2415.599
these blatantly evil

2411.92 --> 2418.7200000000003
doom articles

2415.599 --> 2422.1600000000003
that's why they say these things

2418.72 --> 2425.52
to make us go like we're all [ __ ]

2422.16 --> 2429.1189999999997
let's just give up

2425.52 --> 2429.68
right don't walk over to the edge of the

2429.119 --> 2433.76
abyss

2429.68 --> 2433.7599999999998
just because you want to see how deep it

2435.36 --> 2439.839
[Music]

2436.839 --> 2439.839
is

2441.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
you know what will happen this will

2443.44 --> 2453.839
start staring back at you

2456.27 --> 2461.359
[Music]

2459.599 --> 2464.7200000000003
yeah no [ __ ] it's an addiction aries

2461.359 --> 2468.48
106. absolutely it is

2464.72 --> 2468.48
it's part of safonya syndrome

2468.8 --> 2471.599
it's a sickness

2474.319 --> 2481.52
and they feed you the sickness feed

2477.52 --> 2483.28
psychologically gobble it all up

2481.52 --> 2484.8
and then you become a doom seeker and

2483.28 --> 2486.8
you start to like walk

2484.8 --> 2490.0
everywhere like oh where's the edge of

2486.8 --> 2491.8390000000004
the abyss i want to look into it

2490.0 --> 2494.16
instead of just looking around what is

2491.839 --> 2494.96
there what you could actually do no

2494.16 --> 2498.72
you're gonna see

2494.96 --> 2500.7200000000003
you're gonna ignore it all and look

2498.72 --> 2504.24
where you can find that edge of the

2500.72 --> 2509.839
abyss just to stare in it again

2504.24 --> 2509.839
it's not very productive

2518.8 --> 2523.3590000000004
never seen a futuristic film with

2520.64 --> 2527.68
harmony and peace with it

2523.359 --> 2531.52
have you ever seen any film of any era

2527.68 --> 2531.52
with peace in it and harmony

2532.24 --> 2536.0
like our films with peace and harmony

2535.44 --> 2538.56
even

2536.0 --> 2538.56
interesting

2540.48 --> 2551.839
well thighs

2566.48 --> 2570.4
yeah star trek did have a pretty

2568.319 --> 2572.56
optimistic vision of the future but

2570.4 --> 2575.92
there's no peace and harmony though

2572.56 --> 2578.0789999999997
right even if they attained

2575.92 --> 2580.64
internal peace and harmony which is what

2578.079 --> 2583.92
was suggested

2580.64 --> 2586.72
then still outside there are the others

2583.92 --> 2590.16
that are not peaceful and harmonious

2586.72 --> 2592.3999999999996
right every era always

2590.16 --> 2594.8799999999997
so that doesn't exist in films films

2592.4 --> 2598.0
that are only about peace and harmony

2594.88 --> 2599.599
and series they don't exist because

2598.0 --> 2607.839
nobody's gonna watch it everybody's

2599.599 --> 2607.839
gonna get bored out of their minds

2611.68 --> 2615.04
right that's right moth eyes lessons

2614.64 --> 2617.359
aren't

2615.04 --> 2618.319
learned are only learned through

2617.359 --> 2621.839
struggle

2618.319 --> 2621.839
and strife

2654.56 --> 2663.839
what modern abrahamic doomsday

2660.839 --> 2663.839
what

2688.839 --> 2695.04
uh

2691.359 --> 2698.0789999999997
all right well yeah chabinator

2695.04 --> 2700.88
nathan r yeah that's right

2698.079 --> 2703.04
because everything bill gates touches

2700.88 --> 2704.88
goes to [ __ ]

2703.04 --> 2706.8
like doesn't mean that it will

2704.88 --> 2707.44
permanently always be that because

2706.8 --> 2710.96
there's still

2707.44 --> 2712.079
people working they might counter that

2710.96 --> 2714.079
they might not agree

2712.079 --> 2715.8390000000004
they might simply be financially

2714.079 --> 2718.48
obligated bought up

2715.839 --> 2720.0
all that kind of [ __ ] and some of them

2718.48 --> 2721.839
will keep resisting

2720.0 --> 2725.359
and they will be an integral part that

2721.839 --> 2728.16
cannot be discarded etc etc

2725.359 --> 2730.56
but yeah every time bill gates tries to

2728.16 --> 2734.8799999999997
do something his entire life

2730.56 --> 2734.88
it seems like he is focused on

2735.599 --> 2741.44
ways to make people fail

2739.52 --> 2742.64
that seems to be one of his primary

2741.44 --> 2746.0
objective

2742.64 --> 2749.68
objectives to cause as many people

2746.0 --> 2753.92
as humanly inhumanly possible

2749.68 --> 2757.359
to become failed to fail every test

2753.92 --> 2761.28
every spiritual test every personal test

2757.359 --> 2764.96
so yeah he he is

2761.28 --> 2768.2400000000002
the most satanic person like the real

2764.96 --> 2772.8
esoteric satanist he is

2768.24 --> 2772.7999999999997
the most satanic person i've ever read

2772.839 --> 2778.0789999999997
about

2775.68 --> 2780.96
especially a modern day and he wants to

2778.079 --> 2784.2400000000002
be and doesn't mean that he's the most

2780.96 --> 2788.079
like bloody demonic or whatever no

2784.24 --> 2792.16
he's esoterically

2788.079 --> 2792.1600000000003
most satanic person i've ever seen

2794.48 --> 2802.16
because everything he does

2797.599 --> 2806.56
he does to cause more people to fail he

2802.16 --> 2806.56
just wants entire humanity to fail

2807.44 --> 2815.839
what the hell i

2811.359 --> 2821.44
your leader you need a leader do you

2815.839 --> 2824.72
right well entry fee is paypal donation

2821.44 --> 2826.88
right if you want me to be your leader

2824.72 --> 2831.04
you got to send me money because yeah

2826.88 --> 2833.359
otherwise i can't really do anything

2831.04 --> 2834.8
and yeah i'll try to lead you but you

2833.359 --> 2837.119
gotta recognize that

2834.8 --> 2838.96
you mostly gotta lead yourself and

2837.119 --> 2840.079
that's gonna be part of my leadership

2838.96 --> 2843.359
policy

2840.079 --> 2844.319
to make you lead yourself right but i do

2843.359 --> 2848.24
need funds

2844.319 --> 2851.52
so i'm gonna use this opportunity to ask

2848.24 --> 2852.24
for more funds paypal donations would be

2851.52 --> 2856.4
great

2852.24 --> 2860.319
i still need it i spent

2856.4 --> 2860.319
money also yeah on supplements

2861.04 --> 2868.319
and currently running out of fish oil

2865.2 --> 2869.68
and with what i got i need for food for

2868.319 --> 2873.52
the coming days

2869.68 --> 2876.0
i've like cut down

2873.52 --> 2879.7599999999998
significantly on any form of cannabis

2876.0 --> 2879.76
intake i basically now take

2879.839 --> 2885.839
i've halved it again so i'm really

2883.04 --> 2888.319
to micro dosing standards now and it

2885.839 --> 2890.48
works out great

2888.319 --> 2893.44
and it's even weirder because i'm

2890.48 --> 2893.44
feeling like wow

2893.76 --> 2897.119
it's almost like because i'm slowing

2896.319 --> 2899.119
that down

2897.119 --> 2900.1600000000003
it's starting to work differently and

2899.119 --> 2902.2400000000002
i'm almost

2900.16 --> 2904.48
envisioning like maybe i could really

2902.24 --> 2908.16
completely do without now

2904.48 --> 2911.92
now that i've went under the threshold

2908.16 --> 2914.96
it's bizarre but yeah that's not

2911.92 --> 2916.16
as much of a cost rate now but food

2914.96 --> 2919.92
still is and

2916.16 --> 2922.16
supplements so please

2919.92 --> 2929.839
donate to my paypal so i can get some

2922.16 --> 2929.839
fish oil that will be great

2951.839 --> 2955.2
god made this world so it's going to

2954.4 --> 2959.92
remain

2955.2 --> 2959.9199999999996
a mystery what why

2961.359 --> 2965.92
sardines but

2966.8 --> 2972.88
now regular fish organic is

2970.079 --> 2973.52
also kind of expensive right and the

2972.88 --> 2976.559
problem is

2973.52 --> 2978.24
i don't like eating fish i really don't

2976.559 --> 2979.599
that's why i take fish oil because it's

2978.24 --> 2981.5989999999997
still i need it

2979.599 --> 2984.6400000000003
it's just that i really don't like the

2981.599 --> 2987.28
taste of fish

2984.64 --> 2989.839
right i really don't don't even like the

2987.28 --> 2989.8390000000004
smell of it

2995.2 --> 3000.7999999999997
the spinning bow earth is a metaphor a

2998.319 --> 3013.839
metaphor for what

3000.8 --> 3013.8390000000004
pj says lols

3017.839 --> 3022.88
we are not god so we have to humble

3020.0 --> 3022.88
ourselves no

3024.839 --> 3027.839
no

3028.64 --> 3032.64
that i don't see this sounds like

3030.8 --> 3036.2400000000002
exoterics

3032.64 --> 3036.96
i i disagree like yeah to be humble is a

3036.24 --> 3040.5589999999997
virtue

3036.96 --> 3045.04
right but

3040.559 --> 3045.0400000000004
god also actually wants you to engage

3045.599 --> 3049.839
do the things that are part of the

3047.359 --> 3049.839
design

3051.04 --> 3057.92
and if you have certain capacities

3054.88 --> 3060.4
then it would probably

3057.92 --> 3062.96
feel like a sin not to apply them

3060.4 --> 3062.96
properly

3066.24 --> 3070.24
right but yeah if you mean we need to

3068.96 --> 3072.88
humble ourselves

3070.24 --> 3074.3999999999996
in order to establish that it's

3072.88 --> 3077.92
incredibly difficult

3074.4 --> 3082.64
to know much right it

3077.92 --> 3084.8
like knowledge

3082.64 --> 3086.48
is like a fractal and once you

3084.8 --> 3088.96
understand that then you understand that

3086.48 --> 3090.72
you can never know everything

3088.96 --> 3093.28
and that if you did it would be all

3090.72 --> 3097.839
pointless

3093.28 --> 3097.8390000000004
from a living perspective

3099.04 --> 3102.24
and there's always more and that if that

3101.68 --> 3106.16
is

3102.24 --> 3106.16
being humble perhaps

3106.559 --> 3112.6400000000003
but there is a lot that we can know

3109.599 --> 3115.92
and it grows right and that's not just

3112.64 --> 3119.1189999999997
physical knowledge it's also

3115.92 --> 3120.96
spiritual knowledge there's a lot to

3119.119 --> 3122.96
learn and there's a lot of things you

3120.96 --> 3138.319
can figure out

3122.96 --> 3142.559
there's always more

3138.319 --> 3145.44
okay nathan r if you say so

3142.559 --> 3147.599
now please donate to my paypal i command

3145.44 --> 3147.599

3200.0 --> 3203.28

3220.24 --> 3226.0789999999997
commences okay this is

3223.68 --> 3228.1099999999997
what aries did you donate to my paypal

3226.079 --> 3230.559
as well

3228.11 --> 3237.599
[Laughter]

3230.559 --> 3241.8390000000004
no but look

3237.599 --> 3241.839
as your newly appointed leader

3242.4 --> 3249.04
uh yeah i command you to not just

3246.48 --> 3251.119
stand by and wait for me to give you

3249.04 --> 3255.599
orders

3251.119 --> 3259.2000000000003
i command you to build your life

3255.599 --> 3263.04
learn from the lessons you have

3259.2 --> 3264.3999999999996
and try to work on yourself for on every

3263.04 --> 3267.2
front

3264.4 --> 3267.839
and also figure out which fronts are you

3267.2 --> 3270.64
good at

3267.839 --> 3272.24
working on learn yourself know yourself

3270.64 --> 3275.359
know

3272.24 --> 3278.9599999999996
where the improvement seems

3275.359 --> 3282.0789999999997
the most prevalent and add that

3278.96 --> 3284.4
size up yourself into future

3282.079 --> 3285.3590000000004
growth like you gotta envision where

3284.4 --> 3287.52
you're going to

3285.359 --> 3289.359
with your own development that's very

3287.52 --> 3292.48
important so

3289.359 --> 3295.5989999999997
i command you

3292.48 --> 3295.599
to focus on that

3297.359 --> 3300.24
keep that in mind

3300.559 --> 3308.4
learn yourself learn how you work

3304.319 --> 3312.4
learn what you can do and also

3308.4 --> 3314.64
well at some point you gotta try out

3312.4 --> 3316.319
new things like things you haven't tried

3314.64 --> 3317.44
before as long as they're not immoral

3316.319 --> 3319.359
anyway

3317.44 --> 3322.2400000000002
right you gotta try new things with the

3319.359 --> 3325.2
new skill ranges that you've developed

3322.24 --> 3326.3999999999996
in order to figure out new things that

3325.2 --> 3329.68
you could not

3326.4 --> 3331.6800000000003
see before because when you develop new

3329.68 --> 3335.04
skills

3331.68 --> 3337.2799999999997
you also pick up on new pieces of data

3335.04 --> 3339.319
that you would have missed out on

3337.28 --> 3342.48
because you would have been distracted

3339.319 --> 3344.0
preoccupied with those sensories with

3342.48 --> 3347.04
your conscious focus

3344.0 --> 3348.16
you wouldn't see it in the information

3347.04 --> 3352.64
you were presented with

3348.16 --> 3352.64
energy or verbal right

3356.88 --> 3363.839
supreme commander look i'm not cobra

3359.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
commander thanks terry 306.

3371.37 --> 3376.16
[Music]

3374.16 --> 3377.2799999999997
although i agree that when i get really

3376.16 --> 3380.0
pissed off i might

3377.28 --> 3383.28
sound a little like cobra commander but

3380.0 --> 3387.28
without the screechy voice

3383.28 --> 3387.28
but i can't get pretty pissed off

3388.839 --> 3395.04
uh

3390.4 --> 3395.04
full of wrath and all that [ __ ] uh

3396.0 --> 3401.119
our leader and we're your soldiers we

3397.92 --> 3405.839
will die for you oh really

3401.119 --> 3405.839
right care to prove that

3421.359 --> 3436.319
aladdin what

3433.68 --> 3437.1189999999997
collectively we know far more but we can

3436.319 --> 3441.359
never know

3437.119 --> 3441.359
all as it will kill the desire of

3444.839 --> 3448.48
curiosity

3446.16 --> 3448.48
well

3449.52 --> 3453.119
almost that's an interesting statement

3452.079 --> 3455.8390000000004
there moth ice

3453.119 --> 3456.1600000000003
what you said there collectively we know

3455.839 --> 3459.44
far

3456.16 --> 3461.7599999999998
more but we can never know all

3459.44 --> 3463.119
as it will kill the desire of curiosity

3461.76 --> 3467.76
well

3463.119 --> 3470.0
the thing is you can't know it all

3467.76 --> 3471.599
that's the part you can never like

3470.0 --> 3474.799
really know it all

3471.599 --> 3477.92
because as you said the curiosity

3474.799 --> 3480.24
will fade and then at some point you're

3477.92 --> 3482.7200000000003
just not gonna reach out

3480.24 --> 3483.7599999999998
you're you won't have the curiosity

3482.72 --> 3487.5989999999997
indeed

3483.76 --> 3490.6400000000003
to reach it because from the inside

3487.599 --> 3490.6400000000003
it will be stopped

3490.88 --> 3494.079
right so there is so it's almost like a

3492.559 --> 3497.76
knowledge sale

3494.079 --> 3497.76
say failsafe mechanism

3498.88 --> 3505.92
that keeps you to human standard levels

3503.92 --> 3508.4
well as far as you can take it unless

3505.92 --> 3510.559
you have another mission to guide you

3508.4 --> 3513.599
beyond curiosity right

3510.559 --> 3515.92
because curiosity will typically bring

3513.599 --> 3518.079
you to a certain level of insight

3515.92 --> 3519.52
depending on the levels of curiosity you

3518.079 --> 3523.44
have

3519.52 --> 3526.16
but it is a mission that can reach

3523.44 --> 3526.64
way beyond your normal curiosity levels

3526.16 --> 3528.24
right

3526.64 --> 3530.48
because if you have a really heavy

3528.24 --> 3532.4799999999996
mission and it's it's solid

3530.48 --> 3534.319
it's a real thing it's not just a vague

3532.48 --> 3537.92
idea

3534.319 --> 3540.16
then if you're serious about it

3537.92 --> 3541.76
then at some point during that mission

3540.16 --> 3544.0
it's very likely

3541.76 --> 3545.6800000000003
you will lose your curiosity when you

3544.0 --> 3547.28
learn what you need to

3545.68 --> 3549.1189999999997
but that's not going to make you stop

3547.28 --> 3549.599
though right because you have the

3549.119 --> 3551.6800000000003
mission

3549.599 --> 3555.28
so instead of curiosity it will be the

3551.68 --> 3555.2799999999997
mission that will carry you through

3556.96 --> 3563.599
and that's a burden it's very stressful

3560.0 --> 3565.92
right in a way i've i've reached that

3563.599 --> 3565.92
point

3566.799 --> 3571.28
because i've learned enough to basically

3568.96 --> 3573.68
not really want to know more

3571.28 --> 3575.8390000000004
except for like fields details about

3573.68 --> 3577.5989999999997
cosmogeny and physics perhaps and all

3575.839 --> 3579.599
that

3577.599 --> 3582.6400000000003
but the more existential things yeah i

3579.599 --> 3586.0
have learned more than i could handle

3582.64 --> 3588.96
blatantly and that

3586.0 --> 3592.4
did kind of like ruin that part of the

3588.96 --> 3592.4
natural curiosity

3592.72 --> 3600.0
but i have a mission instead and that

3596.24 --> 3602.0789999999997
now carries me through

3600.0 --> 3603.119
and that mission is also tied in what i

3602.079 --> 3605.8390000000004
do here

3603.119 --> 3607.92
and with the flat earth debates that's

3605.839 --> 3610.96
what carries me through

3607.92 --> 3614.799
if i didn't have it then i'd probably

3610.96 --> 3617.52
retract because yeah

3614.799 --> 3618.72
the counter side of it i'm very tired of

3617.52 --> 3621.28
it all

3618.72 --> 3621.2799999999997
in ways

3626.64 --> 3631.5989999999997
but yeah the mission is just more

3629.119 --> 3631.599
important

3632.64 --> 3642.0
and there is development also i need

3636.799 --> 3644.319
i need it

3642.0 --> 3645.28
i feel that i need it for things in the

3644.319 --> 3648.72
future

3645.28 --> 3652.6400000000003
an age of confusion and and

3648.72 --> 3655.2799999999997
intuitive depletion somebody with a high

3652.64 --> 3657.2799999999997
scale of knowledge

3655.28 --> 3659.0400000000004
and the burdens that come with it are

3657.28 --> 3663.2000000000003
critical

3659.04 --> 3663.2
some they will become critical

3665.359 --> 3674.0
that's kind of part of the mission

3670.079 --> 3676.88
like i'm i'm the living library in a way

3674.0 --> 3678.079
except this library is not full of book

3676.88 --> 3681.52
knowledge

3678.079 --> 3686.799
this library is full of

3681.52 --> 3689.119
memory based communication knowledge

3686.799 --> 3690.4
and including other people's memories

3689.119 --> 3692.799
yeah that's kind of weird how that

3690.4 --> 3694.96
sounds but

3692.799 --> 3695.92
yeah it's it's a different it's more

3694.96 --> 3701.28
akashic

3695.92 --> 3701.28
one could argue right anyway

3703.119 --> 3708.48
curiosity kills the cats i mean

3706.16 --> 3712.799
conspiracy cats

3708.48 --> 3714.96
i heard he made or was it him

3712.799 --> 3717.28
so somebody else made a video about me

3714.96 --> 3717.28
again

3723.68 --> 3727.839
i don't even watch those anymore by the

3725.52 --> 3727.839
way

3736.799 --> 3740.319
i bet the whole bunch of people are now

3738.48 --> 3741.92
going to be squirting over that arwin

3740.319 --> 3745.2799999999997
has become a cult leader

3741.92 --> 3749.6800000000003
because some weirdos in chat

3745.28 --> 3752.7200000000003
pardon me nathan r i do appreciate

3749.68 --> 3754.8799999999997
the dedication with your paypal donation

3752.72 --> 3756.3999999999996
but because some people in chat thought

3754.88 --> 3760.1600000000003
oh we're gonna be

3756.4 --> 3762.88
leader like you decided

3760.16 --> 3764.799
that and now they're gonna call me a

3762.88 --> 3768.559
cult but that's all fine

3764.799 --> 3771.44
right i have more than enough

3768.559 --> 3772.2400000000002
things that i've done in my past here on

3771.44 --> 3774.079
the show

3772.24 --> 3775.4399999999996
right in front of everybody to make

3774.079 --> 3780.799
people write

3775.44 --> 3783.68
like entire fantasy sci-fi

3780.799 --> 3784.48
books about me and what i could be and

3783.68 --> 3787.52
whatever right

3784.48 --> 3789.92
like infinite squirter opportunity like

3787.52 --> 3791.599
yeah i know and that's why i don't

3789.92 --> 3791.92
really go after it anymore because i

3791.599 --> 3793.839
know

3791.92 --> 3796.64
like yeah there's people that are going

3793.839 --> 3799.44
to have out of control ideas

3796.64 --> 3799.92
about me and what i do and what i stand

3799.44 --> 3803.2000000000003
for and

3799.92 --> 3805.52
everything about my secret past even

3803.2 --> 3805.7599999999998
though i literally throw it oh more open

3805.52 --> 3809.0389999999998
than

3805.76 --> 3811.8390000000004
anybody you've ever seen right

3809.039 --> 3811.8390000000004
ever

3812.96 --> 3816.88
right because parts of my past are a

3815.039 --> 3824.2400000000002
secret to me

3816.88 --> 3826.0
had some quite surreal experiences

3824.24 --> 3827.4399999999996
right if you experience things and you

3826.0 --> 3831.2
can't pinpoint it back

3827.44 --> 3839.2000000000003
and you can't find anybody to confirm it

3831.2 --> 3843.7599999999998
that's weird

3839.2 --> 3848.3999999999996
is the new two suns claim

3843.76 --> 3848.4
part of fe cosmology no

3849.2 --> 3853.839
what two sons

3866.64 --> 3870.319
you you know the sun is not an object

3869.92 --> 3872.88
right

3870.319 --> 3872.88
rufus

3873.92 --> 3878.7200000000003
two suns like there is zero suns there

3876.88 --> 3882.1600000000003
is no sun

3878.72 --> 3885.0389999999998
right that's not an object so to say

3882.16 --> 3886.24
here is one sun there is another

3885.039 --> 3889.3590000000004
[ __ ]

3886.24 --> 3891.52
every sun or no sun is a unique

3889.359 --> 3893.2799999999997
observation it's not a thing

3891.52 --> 3895.2
it's just energy manifest it's light

3893.28 --> 3897.76
manifest

3895.2 --> 3899.2799999999997
and that particular part of the globe of

3897.76 --> 3904.3190000000004
the heavens the sun

3899.28 --> 3908.559
happens to be pretty heavy on the energy

3904.319 --> 3911.119
right yeah that's right there is no sun

3908.559 --> 3912.1600000000003
sun is not an object it's an apparition

3911.119 --> 3915.6800000000003
it's a hologram

3912.16 --> 3918.64
it's a side effect of light manifest

3915.68 --> 3920.3999999999996
reaching you from a specific angle in

3918.64 --> 3923.359
relation to your

3920.4 --> 3925.359
position as an observer that's what the

3923.359 --> 3928.4
sun is it's just a side effect

3925.359 --> 3928.4
it's not an object

3933.44 --> 3937.76
it's not an object doesn't matter what

3935.599 --> 3939.6800000000003
filters you put on it's not an object

3937.76 --> 3942.3190000000004
the sun is not an object it doesn't have

3939.68 --> 3944.5589999999997
a proximity

3942.319 --> 3946.4
doesn't have an angular size increase it

3944.559 --> 3949.039
doesn't have a location

3946.4 --> 3951.28
persistently it's not an object there's

3949.039 --> 3954.88
no proof that it is an object

3951.28 --> 3954.88
perspective doesn't apply

3954.96 --> 3961.52
you can't reach it it's not an

3958.16 --> 3963.44
object right you want to claim that's my

3961.52 --> 3966.319
claim the sun is not an object

3963.44 --> 3967.359
it doesn't exist it's light it's just

3966.319 --> 3970.4
light and only

3967.359 --> 3971.92
light light that you see when you look

3970.4 --> 3974.2400000000002
in the direction

3971.92 --> 3976.96
from which that light specifically

3974.24 --> 3980.16
manifests in your position

3976.96 --> 3984.64
that's where you see a sun disk

3980.16 --> 3984.64
it's not an object it's a side effect

3984.799 --> 3991.68
i said there is in the sun i say

3988.16 --> 3994.16
there is no sun the sun doesn't exist

3991.68 --> 3995.68
yeah go squirt for me [ __ ] go squirt

3994.16 --> 3998.24
for me there is no sun

3995.68 --> 4000.319
it does not exist yeah and if you're

3998.24 --> 4002.72
still too dumb to understand that

4000.319 --> 4004.16
then you can take the opportunity to use

4002.72 --> 4007.1189999999997
your misunderstanding

4004.16 --> 4009.359
and build an entire exoteric structure

4007.119 --> 4010.079
on how arwen is crazy for saying there's

4009.359 --> 4012.0
no sun

4010.079 --> 4013.3590000000004
because you're too stupid to understand

4012.0 --> 4015.28
what i'm actually saying

4013.359 --> 4017.2799999999997
even though i've just been explaining it

4015.28 --> 4021.52
two times in a row

4017.28 --> 4023.52
right go ahead oh really moth eyes

4021.52 --> 4026.96
china has an artificial sun where is

4023.52 --> 4026.96
that where is it

4029.52 --> 4035.839
where is it

4057.359 --> 4060.72
in the community

4061.039 --> 4068.559
well the community i am not i am our win

4065.119 --> 4071.6800000000003
i am not the community right

4068.559 --> 4075.3590000000004
disc believers ob

4071.68 --> 4078.2799999999997
celestial object believers

4075.359 --> 4079.839
that's not me i am not a part of that i

4078.28 --> 4083.599
specifically

4079.839 --> 4086.16
say no i don't not me

4083.599 --> 4087.2000000000003
and i've done it over four years ago

4086.16 --> 4089.839
publicly

4087.2 --> 4091.839
i am not a part of that belief here is

4089.839 --> 4094.5589999999997
the alternative and everybody oh it's

4091.839 --> 4095.839
ridiculous ridiculous where did you get

4094.559 --> 4097.759
all that oh that's

4095.839 --> 4100.719
are you making things up arwen are you

4097.759 --> 4103.44
making things up yeah yeah

4100.719 --> 4104.799
no i'm figuring it out because the

4103.44 --> 4107.678999999999
elements

4104.799 --> 4108.719
required for these assumptions of the

4107.679 --> 4111.759
physical object

4108.719 --> 4113.759
are missing and i noticed that and when

4111.759 --> 4116.48
i spoke up about it people

4113.759 --> 4119.12
ignored me and said arwen is a baller

4116.48 --> 4122.3189999999995
he's giving a baller a bottle

4119.12 --> 4125.3589999999995
is he giving a baller a bottle oh

4122.319 --> 4130.159000000001
yeah because he says the sun

4125.359 --> 4133.679
doesn't move away over a disk

4130.159 --> 4136.3189999999995
he says the angular speed of the sun

4133.679 --> 4137.1990000000005
is persistent that's what ballers say to

4136.319 --> 4139.4400000000005
claim

4137.199 --> 4140.879999999999
the earth is a ball and spinning

4139.44 --> 4142.639999999999
underneath the sun

4140.88 --> 4144.719
yeah but that's not my claim though

4142.64 --> 4146.4800000000005
right because i don't think the sun is

4144.719 --> 4149.279
an object

4146.48 --> 4150.48
i think it's a hologram it's a light

4149.279 --> 4154.159000000001
based phenomena

4150.48 --> 4157.599999999999
side effect that's my claim

4154.159 --> 4160.0
and so since it is not a physical object

4157.6 --> 4164.0
with a proximity and a euclidean

4160.0 --> 4167.279
specific location over the earth

4164.0 --> 4168.0
right i'm going to say yeah the sun

4167.279 --> 4171.92
travels

4168.0 --> 4171.92
at a persistent angular speed

4172.0 --> 4175.6
does not abide by the laws of

4174.719 --> 4179.279
perspective

4175.6 --> 4182.400000000001
so it's not an object floating

4179.279 --> 4185.759
over a disk that's right and i've been

4182.4 --> 4185.759
saying it for four years

4186.719 --> 4192.719
yeah i am a f ear

4189.839 --> 4192.719
can't handle it

4194.08 --> 4203.84
oh wait you're asking rufus no rufus is

4197.52 --> 4203.84
a baller

4216.88 --> 4220.400000000001
people never think about the angular

4218.88 --> 4222.0
size increase

4220.4 --> 4224.48
well that's not it's because it's not

4222.0 --> 4227.36
relevant there is no real

4224.48 --> 4227.839999999999
angular size increase right if there is

4227.36 --> 4230.96
some

4227.84 --> 4234.4800000000005
size increase or decrease because of a

4230.96 --> 4237.6
presumed proximity effect a

4234.48 --> 4238.879999999999
object being in a specific position over

4237.6 --> 4241.6
the earth and then

4238.88 --> 4244.08
coming closer going away that's why it

4241.6 --> 4246.88
seems to become bigger and smaller

4244.08 --> 4248.88
yeah if that were the case then the

4246.88 --> 4249.4400000000005
bigger and smaller would not be the only

4248.88 --> 4253.92
thing

4249.44 --> 4258.32
no there would be apparent angular speed

4253.92 --> 4260.96
changes because it's moving over

4258.32 --> 4262.0
the earth at a speed and like all

4260.96 --> 4266.719
objects

4262.0 --> 4269.36
moving over the earth it has a specific

4266.719 --> 4270.84
effect if things go into the distance

4269.36 --> 4274.799999999999
the angular speed

4270.84 --> 4276.88
decreases because of perspective

4274.8 --> 4278.8
right that doesn't apply to the sun so

4276.88 --> 4281.6
there's no very easy alternative

4278.8 --> 4283.360000000001
explanation why is there an angular size

4281.6 --> 4284.64
increase and decrease with things like

4283.36 --> 4287.04
the sun

4284.64 --> 4289.04
well that's because of refraction it's

4287.04 --> 4292.48
because of the atmosphere when it's

4289.04 --> 4295.36
the highest there's less

4292.48 --> 4296.159
this yeah within the range that you're

4295.36 --> 4300.08
looking

4296.159 --> 4302.08
there is less air to look through and

4300.08 --> 4303.6
the amount the preponderance of area

4302.08 --> 4306.88
you're looking through has an

4303.6 --> 4308.159000000001
effect like a lensing effect on the

4306.88 --> 4311.36
hologram

4308.159 --> 4313.5199999999995
of the sun so that's a good explanation

4311.36 --> 4316.799999999999
why there seems to be an angular size

4313.52 --> 4320.719
increase yet there is no angular speed

4316.8 --> 4323.76
changes right done

4320.719 --> 4325.199
the sun is not an object right it

4323.76 --> 4327.6
doesn't exist

4325.199 --> 4328.799999999999
it's a hologram it's a side effect

4327.6 --> 4331.120000000001
there's light

4328.8 --> 4332.719
absolutely there's light manifesting

4331.12 --> 4335.04
it's reaching us

4332.719 --> 4336.4800000000005
it's being absorbed it's being reflected

4335.04 --> 4339.12
all that

4336.48 --> 4341.04
but it's unique it's unique to the

4339.12 --> 4343.76
observer in that location

4341.04 --> 4344.48
because in another spot the sun is going

4343.76 --> 4347.52
to seem

4344.48 --> 4348.4
in another location angular wise and

4347.52 --> 4351.4400000000005
it's going to

4348.4 --> 4355.04
throw off different light with different

4351.44 --> 4356.879999999999
shadows and everything because it's not

4355.04 --> 4359.84
an object it's a side effect

4356.88 --> 4362.0
it's not a thing in a specific location

4359.84 --> 4371.84
shining on us like a lamp

4362.0 --> 4371.84
that's not what the sun is

4372.64 --> 4375.679
all right tom parker glad you liked it i

4374.88 --> 4379.36
know it's a

4375.679 --> 4381.679
it's tough it's a it's a tough

4379.36 --> 4384.88
realization i've been trying to hammer

4381.679 --> 4386.96
it out for four years and i'm very glad

4384.88 --> 4388.56
that some people are at least starting

4386.96 --> 4390.56
to recognize

4388.56 --> 4392.96
that i may have a really good point here

4390.56 --> 4396.320000000001
it's just that yeah when you

4392.96 --> 4396.88
entertain that when you try to see it

4396.32 --> 4398.88
like that

4396.88 --> 4401.04
yeah the world becomes a lot more

4398.88 --> 4405.1990000000005
freaking surreal i know

4401.04 --> 4408.0
reality is surreal it's one of my mottos

4405.199 --> 4410.879999999999
right you think reality is simple and

4408.0 --> 4413.6
literal and all that oh

4410.88 --> 4415.28
well you got a couple of surprises

4413.6 --> 4418.719
waiting for you

4415.28 --> 4422.32
because reality is surreal

4418.719 --> 4426.0
right our minds normalize

4422.32 --> 4428.48
things to us

4426.0 --> 4429.36
because if things are too complicated

4428.48 --> 4432.48
that gives us

4429.36 --> 4435.839999999999
unrest so we oversimplify things

4432.48 --> 4440.5599999999995
and a lot of the teachings we get

4435.84 --> 4446.400000000001
school other places tv

4440.56 --> 4449.6
they hand you the simplifying mechanisms

4446.4 --> 4453.28
that you take for granted

4449.6 --> 4455.84
make it your own to adapt to society

4453.28 --> 4456.719
and then you don't realize that you've

4455.84 --> 4460.159000000001
been handed

4456.719 --> 4460.96
an oversimplification of looking at the

4460.159 --> 4463.04
world

4460.96 --> 4465.04
and taking that for granted and oh look

4463.04 --> 4466.56
somebody has a completely different idea

4465.04 --> 4469.679
he must be crazy

4466.56 --> 4471.92
right even if you believe in flat earth

4469.679 --> 4473.679
you may still think oh this guy is crazy

4471.92 --> 4475.52
right this is crazy what kind of

4473.679 --> 4478.2390000000005
crazy person would say the sun is not an

4475.52 --> 4480.0
object there's no demonstration of this

4478.239 --> 4481.599999999999
everything light we make here on earth

4480.0 --> 4483.679
is from an object how can you

4481.6 --> 4485.280000000001
say that the sun is not an object you

4483.679 --> 4488.0
don't have a demonstration

4485.28 --> 4490.32
right that's what they say because of

4488.0 --> 4493.44
the normalization

4490.32 --> 4494.239
that we've been handed given to us

4493.44 --> 4499.44
through teaching

4494.239 --> 4499.44
through culture of assuming these things

4499.76 --> 4505.76
and not figuring out an alternative

4503.44 --> 4511.839999999999
because then you're crazy then you give

4505.76 --> 4511.84
unrested people

4522.84 --> 4527.4400000000005
ah

4524.69 --> 4532.239
[Music]

4527.44 --> 4532.239
ah that was good it's good to do that

4534.239 --> 4538.4
maybe i should call the hangout after

4536.84 --> 4541.04
that

4538.4 --> 4543.199
yeah i'm gonna do it just to trigger

4541.04 --> 4553.7
people

4543.199 --> 4556.799999999999
it's gonna be fun

4553.7 --> 4556.8
[Music]

4564.84 --> 4581.84
hmm

4567.12 --> 4581.84
there you go

4587.6 --> 4594.88
it's like a projection like a cinema

4591.84 --> 4597.4400000000005
well okay yeah that

4594.88 --> 4600.159000000001
that's the next step isn't there it's

4597.44 --> 4603.5199999999995
now the mechanical nature

4600.159 --> 4604.159
having been deprived of the easy ways to

4603.52 --> 4606.400000000001
imagine

4604.159 --> 4608.239
things even though they're wrong like

4606.4 --> 4611.28
the sun being a physical object

4608.239 --> 4614.718999999999
now comes the issue okay

4611.28 --> 4618.48
so what causes that

4614.719 --> 4619.6
yeah i know right yeah that's a bit

4618.48 --> 4623.5199999999995
difficult right there

4619.6 --> 4626.96
like but we don't even know enough

4623.52 --> 4629.52
about how the hologram of the sun

4626.96 --> 4631.199
specifically manifests in order to

4629.52 --> 4634.56
pursue

4631.199 --> 4637.199
any origin source physically

4634.56 --> 4638.2390000000005
it's tough so all that's left is

4637.199 --> 4642.4
basically

4638.239 --> 4645.12
imaginations like what could

4642.4 --> 4645.679
potentially cause something like that

4645.12 --> 4647.679
and that's

4645.679 --> 4650.64
how i came to the conclusion well it's

4647.679 --> 4654.88
it's probably electric in some way

4650.64 --> 4657.76
and not in a lamp electric as in

4654.88 --> 4659.6
there's something physical energy is

4657.76 --> 4660.08
going through it and that is causing the

4659.6 --> 4663.6
light

4660.08 --> 4665.5199999999995
no rather there is energy

4663.6 --> 4666.64
there is electrical energy there's all

4665.52 --> 4669.679
kinds of energy

4666.64 --> 4673.679
just here it exists it's constant

4669.679 --> 4676.719
or fluctuating it is there everywhere

4673.679 --> 4677.76
there's energy energy even we pick up

4676.719 --> 4680.64
with our spirit

4677.76 --> 4681.679
if you have the senses for it so could

4680.64 --> 4685.04
it be that

4681.679 --> 4686.64
the heavenly body light manifestations

4685.04 --> 4689.84
including the sun are just

4686.64 --> 4693.52
tapping into the haha trigger word

4689.84 --> 4694.64
electric ether not light based medium

4693.52 --> 4697.92
ether right but

4694.64 --> 4700.88
the electric just the electricity there

4697.92 --> 4701.28
the realm might be designed specifically

4700.88 --> 4704.32
so

4701.28 --> 4705.719
that that electrical energy that is

4704.32 --> 4710.32
constantly there

4705.719 --> 4713.44
automatically structurally manifest

4710.32 --> 4716.88
the globe of the heavens

4713.44 --> 4720.4
but how do you test this

4716.88 --> 4723.28
difficult best way

4720.4 --> 4724.799999999999
to try it out would be to get a better

4723.28 --> 4727.679
understanding of the complete

4724.8 --> 4728.320000000001
physical confines of this realm right

4727.679 --> 4731.52
like

4728.32 --> 4734.159
how high does it actually go what is

4731.52 --> 4738.2390000000005
going on in the error layers

4734.159 --> 4740.48
what is the complete geometric confine

4738.239 --> 4742.4
like what is the earth realm actually

4740.48 --> 4743.678999999999
what is the total amount of space what

4742.4 --> 4745.599999999999
is its shape

4743.679 --> 4746.88
what are there are there barrier

4745.6 --> 4749.1990000000005
structures might

4746.88 --> 4751.1990000000005
these barrier structures have some kind

4749.199 --> 4752.96
of intrical influence

4751.199 --> 4754.239
on what happens within other than

4752.96 --> 4757.52
holding the gas

4754.239 --> 4758.718999999999
within right and then if we get a

4757.52 --> 4761.4400000000005
complete oversight

4758.719 --> 4762.4800000000005
and we could basically say okay we can

4761.44 --> 4767.199
now build

4762.48 --> 4770.639999999999
a miniature version very much alike

4767.199 --> 4774.719
and then insert the energies also

4770.64 --> 4776.719
scale down alike and then maybe

4774.719 --> 4779.199
we could like you could have something

4776.719 --> 4782.64
really magical you have

4779.199 --> 4784.799999999999
the realm miniature

4782.64 --> 4785.76
it has to be pressurized and all kinds

4784.8 --> 4788.400000000001
of things

4785.76 --> 4789.679
and then have some micro camry in there

4788.4 --> 4793.12
and who knows

4789.679 --> 4795.84
you might be able to then create

4793.12 --> 4796.32
a micro globe of the heavens within that

4795.84 --> 4798.159000000001
thing

4796.32 --> 4800.4
because of the design if you get it

4798.159 --> 4804.08
right

4800.4 --> 4807.839999999999
that is one of my older ideas

4804.08 --> 4811.92
that even preceded the flat earth

4807.84 --> 4814.719
because that's part i got even way back

4811.92 --> 4814.719
in my visions

4815.04 --> 4820.239
is there a dome well there has to be

4817.12 --> 4822.4
containment somehow

4820.239 --> 4824.0
these are all things we need to figure

4822.4 --> 4827.04
out we need to figure out

4824.0 --> 4828.0
the machine of the realm in order to

4827.04 --> 4831.12
figure out

4828.0 --> 4835.28
how the lights the globe of the heavens

4831.12 --> 4837.12
manifest within it

4835.28 --> 4838.48
because i think that those lights the

4837.12 --> 4842.08
globe of the heavens is

4838.48 --> 4847.839999999999
a intricate manifesting part

4842.08 --> 4847.84
of the design in itself the entire thing

4848.159 --> 4856.08
that is my current assumption

4851.6 --> 4859.52
that is where i would prefer to research

4856.08 --> 4862.239
by emulating the world we might discover

4859.52 --> 4863.280000000001
how the globe of the heavens is actually

4862.239 --> 4875.839999999999
manifested

4863.28 --> 4875.84
within it

4886.84 --> 4893.679
wow so many special

4891.12 --> 4895.04
yeah sorry just stupid fake troll shit's

4893.679 --> 4897.4400000000005
not gonna work

4895.04 --> 4899.76
right there's no flat earther that's

4897.44 --> 4902.48
gonna walk up to me and act like that

4899.76 --> 4905.04
that's only trolls that's trolls that

4902.48 --> 4907.678999999999
don't care either way they just want to

4905.04 --> 4910.159
create more infighting it's really lame

4907.679 --> 4911.12
it's not going to work it's not even

4910.159 --> 4916.638999999999
going to

4911.12 --> 4920.0
change alter the way i feel right now

4916.639 --> 4922.639
some sort of ectoplasma what

4920.0 --> 4931.76
do you even know what ectoplasma is

4922.639 --> 4934.96
nathan rs

4931.76 --> 4937.1990000000005
like ectoplasma is specifically spirit

4934.96 --> 4944.96
activity related

4937.199 --> 4947.839999999999
right living beings

4944.96 --> 4950.08
i don't see how that would exist up

4947.84 --> 4959.4400000000005
there

4950.08 --> 4962.159
it's weird why did you say that

4959.44 --> 4962.159
what is this

4963.49 --> 4966.63
[Music]

4971.36 --> 4975.759999999999
you would certainly see projections

4973.6 --> 4978.96
hitting the other side of the clouds

4975.76 --> 4985.280000000001
on an overcast day

4978.96 --> 4985.28
well yeah yeah when the sun does go down

4985.84 --> 4990.0
even if there is clouds especially if

4988.0 --> 4992.48
they're clouds really high up

4990.0 --> 4993.92
and not so much lower to the ground

4992.48 --> 4996.718999999999
there will be a point that

4993.92 --> 4998.159
even though those high up clouds

4996.719 --> 5001.92
literally cover

4998.159 --> 5004.4
everywhere so vast area yeah

5001.92 --> 5006.4
the sun might still like go underneath

5004.4 --> 5006.799999999999
it and shine on the bottom of it that's

5006.4 --> 5009.12
right

5006.8 --> 5011.04
because it's not in a literal position

5009.12 --> 5014.239
it's only in an angular position

5011.04 --> 5017.5199999999995
in relation to the observer's position

5014.239 --> 5021.36
right and at that angular position

5017.52 --> 5021.360000000001
there are no clouds to block it

5021.84 --> 5029.84
so that is a possibility

5029.92 --> 5035.76
all right okay

5033.199 --> 5036.32
i'll be back two minutes there's gonna

5035.76 --> 5039.52
be more

5036.32 --> 5041.36
show i'm gonna continue the show after

5039.52 --> 5043.120000000001
three even because there's no live flat

5041.36 --> 5045.12
earth debates

5043.12 --> 5046.48
i'm gonna try to fill up that hole a

5045.12 --> 5057.84
little

5046.48 --> 5057.839999999999
i'll see you in two minutes

5068.84 --> 5071.84
oh

5124.84 --> 5127.84
so

5129.199 --> 5134.719
ah i'm back ah it's getting a little

5132.159 --> 5134.719
chilly here

5136.88 --> 5141.84
i'm gonna put my sweater back on

5162.4 --> 5168.719
projection nonsense no okay

5166.719 --> 5171.28
now you're going back and forth with the

5168.719 --> 5174.56
moth eyes here but

5171.28 --> 5176.639
it's not projection nonsense right

5174.56 --> 5178.400000000001
you don't have any evidence of a

5176.639 --> 5179.84
physical nature

5178.4 --> 5183.839999999999
and i've already explained that

5179.84 --> 5183.84
throughout this hangout

5205.76 --> 5209.679
like the what nathan r and maybe the

5208.4 --> 5213.36
sun's existence

5209.679 --> 5214.4800000000005
is like with those electric plasma

5213.36 --> 5217.04
lighters

5214.48 --> 5220.959999999999
what no no because that's still a

5217.04 --> 5220.96
physical thing in a literal position

5221.6 --> 5225.120000000001
there's no life debate today no amanda

5224.159 --> 5228.48
young

5225.12 --> 5232.159
nathan is having a birthday

5228.48 --> 5234.718999999999
for his daughter today so the room he

5232.159 --> 5237.759999999999
normally does the show in is completely

5234.719 --> 5240.88
like filled with presents and

5237.76 --> 5242.400000000001
helium balloons and decorations and all

5240.88 --> 5253.84
that i'm gonna put on the sweater

5242.4 --> 5253.839999999999
because it's way too cold here

5264.84 --> 5267.84
hmm

5295.49 --> 5298.639999999999
[Music]

5306.84 --> 5309.84
so

5317.76 --> 5322.400000000001
right akuma virus yeah you got to be

5319.36 --> 5324.239
careful with that [ __ ] especially if

5322.4 --> 5327.92
you're not used to you need to do a lot

5324.239 --> 5327.919999999999
of stretching and [ __ ] for that

5331.04 --> 5337.36
like yeah when you're a teenager

5334.32 --> 5339.28
and and you're like we really agile yeah

5337.36 --> 5340.5599999999995
you could probably do that [ __ ] just on

5339.28 --> 5342.96
the spot

5340.56 --> 5344.320000000001
right no problem when you get a little

5342.96 --> 5348.4
older

5344.32 --> 5350.88
even in your 20s you need to like

5348.4 --> 5351.679
stretch and [ __ ] otherwise that's gonna

5350.88 --> 5353.6
happen that's

5351.679 --> 5356.4800000000005
that would be just like if i would get

5353.6 --> 5358.639
like doing taekwondo practices all of a

5356.48 --> 5360.799999999999
sudden

5358.639 --> 5362.0
then that probably happened to me too if

5360.8 --> 5366.56
i didn't

5362.0 --> 5366.56
properly prepare my my body for that

5369.199 --> 5372.48
i mean i don't have to stretch for just

5371.04 --> 5379.84
punching or something but

5372.48 --> 5379.839999999999
like any real maneuvers yeah i do

5387.84 --> 5393.84
hey james mason good to see you

5398.8 --> 5401.9890000000005
[Music]

5408.4 --> 5413.199
electric plasma lighters prove it's

5411.6 --> 5417.1990000000005
possible the sun is electric

5413.199 --> 5417.199
no no

5418.8 --> 5424.400000000001
because it's still an elect plasma

5421.52 --> 5428.0
lighter is still an object

5424.4 --> 5431.04
right it's not holographic

5428.0 --> 5433.679
there's still a proximity

5431.04 --> 5435.44
if you get nearer to it the angular size

5433.679 --> 5439.4400000000005
to the observer increases

5435.44 --> 5442.638999999999
right that doesn't happen with the sun

5439.44 --> 5446.638999999999
so when i say the sun is electric

5442.639 --> 5450.0
i don't mean the object presumed to be

5446.639 --> 5452.639
of a sun is electrically driven

5450.0 --> 5454.8
fueled by electricity no i'm saying is

5452.639 --> 5457.92
that whatever causes the hologram

5454.8 --> 5461.360000000001
apparition of it it's very likely that

5457.92 --> 5464.4800000000005
electricity of some form

5461.36 --> 5468.639
has is feeding into that

5464.48 --> 5472.239
phenomena that's it

5468.639 --> 5472.2390000000005
it's not a mechanical device

5474.0 --> 5478.42
also you still haven't donated to my

5475.84 --> 5481.569
paypal in order to uh

5478.42 --> 5481.569
[Music]

5481.679 --> 5491.84
declare me your leader

5493.199 --> 5496.879999999999
all right yeah super straight ear3 i

5495.12 --> 5499.84
caught that on alex jones 2

5496.88 --> 5500.4800000000005
yesterday apparently there's now the the

5499.84 --> 5502.4800000000005
green

5500.48 --> 5504.0
goo chip it's not a chip it's not

5502.48 --> 5507.44
electronic chip it's just a

5504.0 --> 5510.0
green goo thingy a little

5507.44 --> 5512.48
like the matrix like the first matrix

5510.0 --> 5512.48
remember

5513.36 --> 5521.199
they take something out of the tube they

5516.48 --> 5523.839999999999
let them sink into neo's belly button

5521.199 --> 5524.4
it's kind of that that's what they

5523.84 --> 5528.4400000000005
develop

5524.4 --> 5530.839999999999
now i heard about that that's pretty

5528.44 --> 5533.839999999999
[Music]

5530.84 --> 5533.84
freaky

5534.45 --> 5537.62
[Music]

5542.719 --> 5549.52
but yeah it's not a microchip it's a

5546.239 --> 5549.5199999999995
green gooey thingy

5556.639 --> 5560.56
it detects right so it would effectively

5560.159 --> 5563.599999999999
just

5560.56 --> 5568.159000000001
detect virus or

5563.6 --> 5568.159000000001
exosome percentages in your body

5570.239 --> 5576.159
well you know

5573.28 --> 5578.08
i'm not trying to promote it don't take

5576.159 --> 5580.96
it as that but technically

5578.08 --> 5581.28
i wouldn't even mind too much to having

5580.96 --> 5583.6
that

5581.28 --> 5584.96
if it weren't for like who these people

5583.6 --> 5585.84
are what they're actually gonna do with

5584.96 --> 5587.92
that

5585.84 --> 5589.52
but yeah to have a detector that's just

5587.92 --> 5591.6
gonna say look you have this amount of

5589.52 --> 5592.0
exosomes in your body that means you are

5591.6 --> 5597.76
now

5592.0 --> 5603.76
entering like a a six cycle

5597.76 --> 5605.679
right not that i really need that

5603.76 --> 5608.0
because yeah it's not really going to

5605.679 --> 5608.0
matter

5608.4 --> 5612.48
but that's probably what it is it's just

5610.159 --> 5614.638999999999
going to it's just an exosome detector

5612.48 --> 5617.28
just going to detect how many exosomes

5614.639 --> 5620.08
are passing by

5617.28 --> 5621.199
and the more the closer you are to

5620.08 --> 5631.84
actually

5621.199 --> 5631.839999999999
getting sick

5635.28 --> 5639.28
isn't this a repeat show no this is not

5637.04 --> 5642.08
a repeat show

5639.28 --> 5643.199
this is live i'm live we're doing it

5642.08 --> 5645.84
live

5643.199 --> 5645.839999999999
right now

5650.96 --> 5656.4
sun is energy projected from the

5653.76 --> 5656.400000000001
firmament

5656.84 --> 5662.159000000001
what

5658.88 --> 5664.56
that i don't have any clue to that

5662.159 --> 5666.08
i don't know where it's coming from i

5664.56 --> 5669.52
don't think there is anything

5666.08 --> 5669.5199999999995
manifesting outside

5670.88 --> 5674.4800000000005
i think that everything that is

5674.56 --> 5682.080000000001
that we see it's all just manifested

5677.76 --> 5684.08
inside from everything that is inside

5682.08 --> 5687.04
right i'm not presuming there is

5684.08 --> 5689.76
anything outside of the realm

5687.04 --> 5692.48
right perhaps there might be other

5689.76 --> 5695.679
compartments correlating with

5692.48 --> 5697.5199999999995
a heavens realm or something

5695.679 --> 5698.96
but it could be that that's simply not

5697.52 --> 5701.679
the case and that's only

5698.96 --> 5702.08
in the over dimension or in the dream

5701.679 --> 5705.1990000000005
world

5702.08 --> 5708.639
that's supposed to be the real world

5705.199 --> 5711.759999999999
but not the physical world so who knows

5708.639 --> 5714.4800000000005
i don't think that the sun

5711.76 --> 5716.159000000001
the energy that feeds the sun is coming

5714.48 --> 5716.959999999999
from anywhere outside of the realm i

5716.159 --> 5720.5599999999995
have no

5716.96 --> 5721.6
no clues to that right it's very easy to

5720.56 --> 5723.92
imagine

5721.6 --> 5725.119000000001
again imagining it's always the trick

5723.92 --> 5727.92
right

5725.119 --> 5729.599999999999
if you have a glass dome you can have a

5727.92 --> 5731.04
light outside and oh look from the

5729.6 --> 5733.280000000001
inside you could kind

5731.04 --> 5735.92
it could be the realm yeah yeah i've

5733.28 --> 5737.36
seen that for years and years and years

5735.92 --> 5740.4
right

5737.36 --> 5743.839999999999
however there's no absolutely no clue

5740.4 --> 5743.839999999999
that that's actually the case

5744.48 --> 5746.959999999999
at all

5748.159 --> 5750.4
right

5754.0 --> 5759.92
i haven't even seen any

5757.28 --> 5760.5599999999995
balloon high up balloon footage where

5759.92 --> 5763.84
the sun

5760.56 --> 5766.96
is overhead i've not not seen that

5763.84 --> 5768.2390000000005
at all it's always to the side somewhere

5766.96 --> 5770.29
always

5768.239 --> 5773.339999999999
it's never fully overhead

5770.29 --> 5773.34
[Music]

5794.8 --> 5798.719
yeah kumu fires there's no need to

5796.56 --> 5801.1990000000005
confuse things more

5798.719 --> 5802.96
thanks the subject that i'm talking

5801.199 --> 5804.0
about is already kind of confusing no

5802.96 --> 5806.8
need to insert

5804.0 --> 5813.84
more confusion through sarcastic things

5806.8 --> 5813.84
and all that

5824.84 --> 5827.84
so

5839.28 --> 5843.84
huh okay nathan r

5845.52 --> 5849.4400000000005
right it never is isn't it

5852.8 --> 5858.08
like even at the equator it's never

5854.96 --> 5858.08
exactly overhead

5858.639 --> 5862.88
i don't think there's any position

5860.639 --> 5866.84
anywhere on the earth where the sun

5862.88 --> 5872.0
gets exactly above you

5866.84 --> 5872.0
never it's always always angle

5872.639 --> 5877.04
if you can show me a single spot

5875.04 --> 5881.6
anywhere on earth

5877.04 --> 5884.639
where you would see the sun exactly

5881.6 --> 5887.360000000001
90 degrees from all angles right exactly

5884.639 --> 5891.28
the zenith above you that would be

5887.36 --> 5891.28
interesting because i've never seen that

5892.639 --> 5899.52
like paula bible literally did

5896.32 --> 5902.799999999999
some sun mechanical sun hangouts

5899.52 --> 5905.280000000001
figuring that out sun uh with filters

5902.8 --> 5908.96
but also studying the arc of the sun

5905.28 --> 5909.599999999999
right how it appears and she distinctly

5908.96 --> 5912.92
noticed

5909.6 --> 5914.400000000001
within that research yeah it never goes

5912.92 --> 5917.679
exactly

5914.4 --> 5918.48
overhead like never ever not at the

5917.679 --> 5920.32
equator

5918.48 --> 5923.199
nowhere not to the south not to the

5920.32 --> 5926.48
north nowhere does it exactly go over it

5923.199 --> 5932.0
it always goes in a slanted arc

5926.48 --> 5932.0
always so that's very telling

5936.0 --> 5941.679
all right okay nathan r that's that's

5939.44 --> 5953.839999999999
interesting that's interesting to hear

5941.679 --> 5953.84
did you record it

5960.719 --> 5966.4800000000005
right but moth eyes yeah yeah look i'm

5963.44 --> 5970.0
not saying that the sun cannot touch

5966.48 --> 5971.04
a per yeah or may have suggested that

5970.0 --> 5972.48
but that that would have been

5971.04 --> 5974.639
technically incorrect

5972.48 --> 5977.119
i didn't mean to say like it can never

5974.639 --> 5978.2390000000005
be exactly in that spot above you it's

5977.119 --> 5981.28
rather that

5978.239 --> 5984.32
the arc it makes is never

5981.28 --> 5986.639
perfectly like this it's never like it

5984.32 --> 5989.04
might hit that spot

5986.639 --> 5990.8
but it's going to hit that spot and then

5989.04 --> 5994.32
kind of arc away

5990.8 --> 5997.04
not perfectly 180 degrees

5994.32 --> 5998.32
around you it's always going to come at

5997.04 --> 6009.28
an angle

5998.32 --> 6012.5599999999995
like that always

6009.28 --> 6023.84
the arc is never like perfectly straight

6012.56 --> 6023.84
it's always at an angle

6048.84 --> 6051.84
hmm

6080.96 --> 6093.84
kind of a remark is that a kumu virus

6105.199 --> 6108.799999999999
all right but yeah i already corrected

6108.08 --> 6111.84
that

6108.8 --> 6112.88
misunderstanding their akuma virus like

6111.84 --> 6115.360000000001
i suggested

6112.88 --> 6118.159000000001
like a few minutes ago that it would

6115.36 --> 6121.28
never be perfectly straight overhead

6118.159 --> 6124.4
i take that back really did it's

6121.28 --> 6127.599999999999
actually just that the arc is never

6124.4 --> 6127.599999999999
like 90 degrees

6127.92 --> 6134.4800000000005
it's always the arc the set

6130.96 --> 6138.32
that my disc is always

6134.48 --> 6140.879999999999
turned it's always turned it's

6138.32 --> 6141.44
never perfectly like this the apparent

6140.88 --> 6143.52
arc

6141.44 --> 6144.5599999999995
with you in here right it's never like

6143.52 --> 6147.679
this it's

6144.56 --> 6148.0
always turned always so at some point

6147.679 --> 6151.119
yeah

6148.0 --> 6154.56
it might actually get right over you

6151.119 --> 6159.199
but it will not go down exactly

6154.56 --> 6159.1990000000005
on the side opposite of where it came up

6159.52 --> 6166.88
like exactly when yeah

6163.76 --> 6166.88
how do you describe that

6167.199 --> 6177.839999999999
i hope i'm getting through right

6184.56 --> 6187.6
right if you don't understand what i'm

6186.48 --> 6192.08
what i mean then

6187.6 --> 6192.08
please say so and i'll try explaining it

6202.84 --> 6219.84
again

6204.239 --> 6219.839999999999
and it's morning

6234.88 --> 6240.400000000001
what what are you saying chabinator

6237.679 --> 6240.4
that's weird

6241.36 --> 6247.5199999999995
are you gonna tell like

6244.96 --> 6250.2390000000005
a pilot a boat pilot that their

6247.52 --> 6261.84
instruments are not right

6250.239 --> 6261.839999999999
that's kind of a ridiculous thing to say

6288.719 --> 6303.84
i'm getting a little confused as to what

6291.28 --> 6303.84
you're talking about here

6304.56 --> 6311.360000000001
wait is there now like an aeronautics

6308.719 --> 6312.08
engineer and an aviotics engineer in my

6311.36 --> 6317.44
chat both

6312.08 --> 6331.84
disagreeing on the sun position

6317.44 --> 6331.839999999999
that's weird

6370.96 --> 6375.92
all right yeah i

6374.159 --> 6378.48
kind of lost track of what you guys are

6375.92 --> 6378.4800000000005
talking about

6378.639 --> 6384.08
sun position somebody claims it's wrong

6382.32 --> 6386.239
i don't even know what to beat anymore

6384.08 --> 6389.6
at this point

6386.239 --> 6392.48
anyway the sun

6389.6 --> 6393.280000000001
it's not an object it's weird what

6392.48 --> 6395.678999999999
causes it

6393.28 --> 6397.92
who knows but it's very likely to be

6395.679 --> 6401.57
electrical

6397.92 --> 6404.08
because there's a lot of that

6401.57 --> 6407.04
[Music]

6404.08 --> 6409.119
and hey the celestial light angles are

6407.04 --> 6410.96
very persistent

6409.119 --> 6412.88
and predictable and that's why they've

6410.96 --> 6417.52
been used

6412.88 --> 6419.36
for orientation and for navigation

6417.52 --> 6422.88
because of their persistent nature their

6419.36 --> 6422.88
predictable persistent nature

6424.8 --> 6429.84
and that's why some people call it the

6426.48 --> 6429.839999999999
sky clock

6430.0 --> 6435.52
because it effectively is because of its

6432.48 --> 6438.638999999999
predictable nature

6435.52 --> 6441.4400000000005
but as to what is it

6438.639 --> 6444.400000000001
where is it what causes it yeah good

6441.44 --> 6444.4
luck with that one

6445.04 --> 6449.679
i'm not there yet i doubt anybody else

6448.0 --> 6451.679
out there is

6449.679 --> 6453.04
although they might think they are in

6451.679 --> 6455.84
trying to let's

6453.04 --> 6456.8
create it let's create what we think the

6455.84 --> 6458.96
sun might be

6456.8 --> 6461.28
let's make some kind of a lamp thingy or

6458.96 --> 6461.92
plasma and yeah it's all really nice but

6461.28 --> 6465.759999999999
it's still

6461.92 --> 6471.84
a local object that you're creating

6465.76 --> 6471.84
so that's not really going to work

6513.36 --> 6517.44
what do i think sunspots are

6519.6 --> 6527.84
i don't know

6530.639 --> 6535.76
what do you think moon craters are

6534.0 --> 6539.52
right it's the same issue what do you

6535.76 --> 6539.52
think the eclipse is yeah

6539.6 --> 6548.320000000001
is weird i don't know what it is

6544.4 --> 6551.599999999999
is there something truly intrical

6548.32 --> 6554.88
intricately intrinsically connected

6551.6 --> 6555.84
with the sun spots and sunlight output

6554.88 --> 6558.2390000000005
here on earth it's

6555.84 --> 6559.76
suggested by scientists but yeah the

6558.239 --> 6561.678999999999
same scientists are probably freaking

6559.76 --> 6564.56
heliocentrists

6561.679 --> 6564.96
and they always use like a sun model

6564.56 --> 6568.639
with

6564.96 --> 6569.44
giant fountains of fire coming out blah

6568.639 --> 6571.4400000000005
blah blah

6569.44 --> 6572.719
and the dark spots right that's what

6571.44 --> 6575.919999999999
they suggest

6572.719 --> 6578.0
i don't know if there is actually like

6575.92 --> 6580.639
for real

6578.0 --> 6583.28
something that correlates with sunspot

6580.639 --> 6587.28
activity if that actually happens

6583.28 --> 6590.4
yeah it's said but it's said by people

6587.28 --> 6592.0
that very much promote and hold on to

6590.4 --> 6593.92
the heliocentric model

6592.0 --> 6595.36
so i have no idea if there is even

6593.92 --> 6597.84
anything

6595.36 --> 6611.839999999999
any correlation with sunspots and things

6597.84 --> 6611.84
that happen here on earth i have no idea

6640.32 --> 6656.08
what do you see

6652.719 --> 6660.4800000000005
look nathan r you don't have to like

6656.08 --> 6663.92
get on his ass if he saw the sun exactly

6660.48 --> 6665.678999999999
above him exactly that's possible

6663.92 --> 6667.1990000000005
like i made that statement earlier that

6665.679 --> 6669.679
was a mistake

6667.199 --> 6670.96
it can be exactly overhead it's just

6669.679 --> 6674.8
that

6670.96 --> 6678.88
it's never going to be a perfect

6674.8 --> 6680.8
arc like that from one side to the exact

6678.88 --> 6684.88
other side

6680.8 --> 6687.76
with a straight 90 degree

6684.88 --> 6688.8
demi disk like that that's never gonna

6687.76 --> 6691.92
happen

6688.8 --> 6696.2390000000005
it's always coming in an arc

6691.92 --> 6699.76
like that right like

6696.239 --> 6702.718999999999
if you take a virtual circle out of

6699.76 --> 6704.08
uh or surrounding you as to the limit of

6702.719 --> 6708.08
sight

6704.08 --> 6710.08
it's never going to be like 180

6708.08 --> 6711.5199999999995
degrees like that it's always going to

6710.08 --> 6714.639
be shorter

6711.52 --> 6718.0
on one side of the circle

6714.639 --> 6718.4800000000005
as yeah as on the other side that's how

6718.0 --> 6721.52
the sun

6718.48 --> 6723.598999999999
so the sun might come up like this

6721.52 --> 6725.360000000001
this and then get it reach perfectly

6723.599 --> 6726.639
overhead but it's still then gonna go

6725.36 --> 6729.04
down in an arc

6726.639 --> 6731.52
to the other side that's that's what i

6729.04 --> 6734.639
originally meant to say

6731.52 --> 6735.040000000001
right so yeah if he claims he saw the

6734.639 --> 6737.52
sun

6735.04 --> 6740.0
perfectly exactly overhead that is

6737.52 --> 6740.0
possible

6740.56 --> 6744.080000000001
right oh by the way paypal you say

6742.56 --> 6747.76
amanda young ooh

6744.08 --> 6749.76
i will check it out it's nice i can't

6747.76 --> 6752.639
i'm very much looking forward to getting

6749.76 --> 6752.639
my fish oil

6758.32 --> 6765.84
thank you thank you very much

6762.0 --> 6765.84
yeah i'll definitely be able to get it

6772.56 --> 6775.1990000000005
that's nice

6775.92 --> 6779.4400000000005
thank you very much amanda young for

6777.44 --> 6793.839999999999
your continuous support

6779.44 --> 6793.839999999999
i really appreciate it

6804.4 --> 6811.679
ah oh out iron fire iron fires a glober

6809.92 --> 6814.2390000000005
i knew there was something wrong with

6811.679 --> 6817.4400000000005
him he can't handle it

6814.239 --> 6821.44
so hey glober

6817.44 --> 6822.96
yeah engineer on the ship special boy

6821.44 --> 6824.96
you have elite probably got a good

6822.96 --> 6828.32
income a special boy

6824.96 --> 6831.599
well yeah your conception of

6828.32 --> 6833.119
how it works on the flat earth is wrong

6831.599 --> 6835.1990000000005
yeah that's called a straw man

6833.119 --> 6836.159
conception you probably picked it up

6835.199 --> 6838.5599999999995
from some

6836.159 --> 6840.48
relatively superficial flat earth video

6838.56 --> 6843.76
that claimed the earth is

6840.48 --> 6845.598999999999
literally a disk with literally a dome

6843.76 --> 6848.8
under over it

6845.599 --> 6851.92
and literally the moon and sun

6848.8 --> 6855.679
hovering in the euclidean position

6851.92 --> 6858.639
in circles over it right that's

6855.679 --> 6861.28
wrong that's not what the earth is right

6858.639 --> 6863.679
and you're in the wrong hangout for that

6861.28 --> 6864.639
because i don't claim that and most

6863.679 --> 6868.719
people in here

6864.639 --> 6871.4400000000005
neither do they right

6868.719 --> 6872.08
because hey look at the title this sun

6871.44 --> 6874.638999999999
is not an

6872.08 --> 6875.36
object yeah that actually means

6874.639 --> 6878.4800000000005
something

6875.36 --> 6878.88
that's not a joke that's not clickbait

6878.48 --> 6881.839999999999
although

6878.88 --> 6882.159000000001
kind of it is in a way to draw people in

6881.84 --> 6884.32
that

6882.159 --> 6886.638999999999
might think that for their cash right

6884.32 --> 6889.44
well why did you why did you take

6886.639 --> 6890.08
take a look at the information listen to

6889.44 --> 6892.4
what i have to

6890.08 --> 6894.239
say and then see that i'm actually

6892.4 --> 6897.839999999999
making a legitimate point

6894.239 --> 6901.5199999999995
about it right so yeah

6897.84 --> 6904.56
the sun and moon work perfectly

6901.52 --> 6907.360000000001
on a flat earth perfectly you know why

6904.56 --> 6908.56
because i don't assume they're physical

6907.36 --> 6911.92
objects they're light

6908.56 --> 6915.679
based apparitions the sun is a

6911.92 --> 6918.8
hologram like side effect

6915.679 --> 6921.84
it's not actually a thing disc or

6918.8 --> 6922.96
ball in any location it's a side effect

6921.84 --> 6926.400000000001
like a rainbow

6922.96 --> 6929.84
is a side effect right it's

6926.4 --> 6932.32
light manifesting not originating from a

6929.84 --> 6937.04
specific euclidean position in space

6932.32 --> 6941.119
over the earth light manifesting it just

6937.04 --> 6944.719
arrives it's not coming from a source

6941.119 --> 6945.36
a a position based physical source like

6944.719 --> 6947.92
a lamp

6945.36 --> 6949.679
that we would use to create light with

6947.92 --> 6951.599
it's light manifest

6949.679 --> 6953.4400000000005
and when you look in the direction of

6951.599 --> 6954.08
that light manifest in relation to your

6953.44 --> 6957.04
position

6954.08 --> 6958.639
then you will see the sun disk like a

6957.04 --> 6961.199
rainbow

6958.639 --> 6962.8
it's a holographic side effect of

6961.199 --> 6965.919999999999
looking directly

6962.8 --> 6968.159000000001
towards that light manifest

6965.92 --> 6969.679
it's not actually a disc from which the

6968.159 --> 6972.839999999999
light is coming

6969.679 --> 6974.159
the disc is the side effect it's not an

6972.84 --> 6977.28
object

6974.159 --> 6977.679
right and that works perfectly on a flat

6977.28 --> 6981.199
earth

6977.679 --> 6983.76
absolutely perfectly no issues with it

6981.199 --> 6986.96
whatsoever no complications the

6983.76 --> 6988.4800000000005
complications only come in

6986.96 --> 6990.639
when you start to assume they're

6988.48 --> 6993.919999999999
actually balls of fire

6990.639 --> 6997.4400000000005
or whatever hovering

6993.92 --> 7000.639
literally in a euclidean position over a

6997.44 --> 7002.879999999999
literal disk right that's when the

7000.639 --> 7005.679
problem comes in

7002.88 --> 7008.0
and since we don't assume that you don't

7005.679 --> 7011.36
need to tell us

7008.0 --> 7012.8
aaron farr addressing you you don't need

7011.36 --> 7015.839999999999
to tell us

7012.8 --> 7018.96
that none of it works on a flat earth

7015.84 --> 7021.360000000001
because it does because we

7018.96 --> 7022.32
i specifically and hopefully a lot of

7021.36 --> 7026.0
people in chat

7022.32 --> 7029.599
don't assume the celestial bodies to be

7026.0 --> 7033.84
literal physical lamps

7029.599 --> 7033.84
hanging in euclidean space

7034.56 --> 7045.1990000000005
what again the men do you alright

7038.719 --> 7048.88
i'll check it out

7045.199 --> 7048.879999999999
again no wait

7050.08 --> 7054.8
no i i got your paypal man thank you

7052.32 --> 7054.799999999999
very much

7055.28 --> 7059.84
or or are you about to send another one

7062.719 --> 7073.84
i shouted you out i hope you got that

7075.599 --> 7079.28
by the way if anybody else would like to

7077.199 --> 7079.759999999999
contribute that would be great too i'm

7079.28 --> 7086.08
doing

7079.76 --> 7088.0
pretty much a three-hour show today

7086.08 --> 7090.159
because nathan oakley is not doing a

7088.0 --> 7094.32
live show

7090.159 --> 7097.839999999999
he is yeah he is doing a premiere

7094.32 --> 7099.84
show 1388

7097.84 --> 7101.76
and after i round out my show i will

7099.84 --> 7104.639
watch that because it's probably still

7101.76 --> 7104.639
gonna be a good show

7106.32 --> 7111.679
but i am gonna do a three hour show

7108.159 --> 7114.879999999999
today and if already done two hours

7111.679 --> 7116.8
yeah roughly two hours if the sun is a

7114.88 --> 7119.1990000000005
side effect

7116.8 --> 7120.719
do you think the main effect where do

7119.199 --> 7121.598999999999
you think the main effect resides well

7120.719 --> 7124.639
the main effect

7121.599 --> 7127.679
is the light manifest reaching us it is

7124.639 --> 7130.32
the light getting here

7127.679 --> 7131.04
being absorbed scattering reflecting

7130.32 --> 7134.48
causing us

7131.04 --> 7138.08
to naturally see things

7134.48 --> 7142.32
without creating fire

7138.08 --> 7144.48
or a lamp electrically right

7142.32 --> 7146.5599999999995
it's light manifest that's the main

7144.48 --> 7149.678999999999
effect so where is it coming from

7146.56 --> 7152.56
it's here it arrives during the day

7149.679 --> 7154.96
the light manifests when you look at the

7152.56 --> 7157.119000000001
direction

7154.96 --> 7158.0
of the angle at which the light

7157.119 --> 7159.92
manifests

7158.0 --> 7161.679
in that specific position in that

7159.92 --> 7164.0
specific time of day

7161.679 --> 7165.599
then you will see the sun disc as a side

7164.0 --> 7166.8
effect at the epicenter of that

7165.599 --> 7171.84
direction

7166.8 --> 7171.84
that's how i regard it

7197.679 --> 7202.8
yeah by the way yeah dutch sailor yeah

7199.92 --> 7204.639
amanda young is my number one fan

7202.8 --> 7206.400000000001
she declared a couple of times and i

7204.639 --> 7208.96
really appreciate

7206.4 --> 7213.839999999999
her support and her help and also just

7208.96 --> 7213.84
her moral support too

7232.14 --> 7235.209000000001
[Music]

7246.719 --> 7254.0
wow aaron fire you you seem like kind of

7249.28 --> 7258.08
a troll are you triggered

7254.0 --> 7261.04
did did flat earth take away your

7258.08 --> 7261.04
space fantasy

7261.119 --> 7264.799999999999
you don't like it you don't like flat

7264.239 --> 7268.0
earth

7264.8 --> 7272.08
why are you here

7268.0 --> 7272.08
right are you here to prove something

7272.56 --> 7276.080000000001
like it isn't having a well-paying job

7275.44 --> 7279.5199999999995
and being an

7276.08 --> 7280.0
engineer enough for you you have ego

7279.52 --> 7282.56
issues

7280.0 --> 7284.56
you need to come here and just tell us

7282.56 --> 7286.159000000001
how stupid flat earthers are even though

7284.56 --> 7287.280000000001
you don't actually listen to the

7286.159 --> 7288.879999999999
arguments

7287.28 --> 7297.84
is that what you call why you came here

7288.88 --> 7297.84
aaron fire

7302.719 --> 7306.8
like aaron far is are you even listening

7305.28 --> 7308.48
to me

7306.8 --> 7310.56
right i'm gonna do a test right now did

7308.48 --> 7311.678999999999
you get your paper i got your first one

7310.56 --> 7314.639
amanda young

7311.679 --> 7325.84
but i if you have sent another one i

7314.639 --> 7325.84
have not received it

7333.199 --> 7336.4
maybe something went wrong

7336.84 --> 7342.56
right but uh yeah aaron fair

7340.4 --> 7344.159
i'm gonna do a test right now i i hope

7342.56 --> 7346.4800000000005
you're ready for this

7365.04 --> 7369.84
nag

7366.8 --> 7371.04
flat earthers in chat and not actually

7369.84 --> 7374.719
listening to what

7371.04 --> 7378.8
the show host the person talking

7374.719 --> 7380.2390000000005
is saying right and even a kumu virus

7378.8 --> 7383.28
who is kind of a

7380.239 --> 7385.759999999999
troll he even knows that

7383.28 --> 7387.199
like he knows that when i do that yeah i

because yeah if you haven't listened at

7405.44 --> 7408.159
all that totally explains why you are

7407.76 --> 7410.400000000001
still

7408.159 --> 7411.679
blabbering like you haven't heard

7410.4 --> 7414.719
anything

7411.679 --> 7418.08
even though i spent now almost two hours

7414.719 --> 7420.719
explaining the details

7418.08 --> 7422.239
that are very critical to the entire

7420.719 --> 7426.56
argumentation happening

7422.239 --> 7429.919999999999
with you as well so address me

7426.56 --> 7432.079000000001
iron far do it quick

7429.92 --> 7437.84
[Music]

7432.079 --> 7437.84
say my name 30 seconds

7438.88 --> 7442.32
you got 30 seconds aaron fire say my

7441.84 --> 7451.84
name

7442.32 --> 7451.84
or you'll be banned

7455.679 --> 7463.04
ten nine eight

7459.44 --> 7466.638999999999
seven six five

7463.04 --> 7468.96
four three two

7466.639 --> 7468.96
one

7476.84 --> 7479.84
goodbye

7486.719 --> 7492.079
yeah you gotta listen

7489.92 --> 7495.52
you gotta listen when you follow this

7492.079 --> 7500.639
show you can't hang around in my chat

7495.52 --> 7500.639
and ignore me that's not allowed

7504.639 --> 7521.84
especially when you're discussing this

7506.96 --> 7521.84
subject in question

7525.76 --> 7530.159000000001
well andrew the only thing he needed to

7527.76 --> 7532.0
do is just type in my name if he was

7530.159 --> 7535.759999999999
capable

7532.0 --> 7538.88
of going in elaborate typing

7535.76 --> 7539.92
back and forth discussions for like half

7538.88 --> 7542.159000000001
an hour

7539.92 --> 7543.4400000000005
he could have typed my name once in the

7542.159 --> 7545.839999999999
last two minutes

7543.44 --> 7547.44
even gave him two minutes basically and

7545.84 --> 7549.84
so he just wasn't listening

7547.44 --> 7549.839999999999
at all

7555.28 --> 7558.8
and that means that he's not really

7556.8 --> 7560.96
interested he's just there to try and

7558.8 --> 7563.119000000001
make flat earthers look stupid

7560.96 --> 7564.88
to make it worth it everything he

7563.119 --> 7567.36
probably sacrificed to get to his

7564.88 --> 7567.36
position

7574.84 --> 7580.079
right

7576.32 --> 7580.079
that's no excuse steamy traveler

7580.719 --> 7585.04
there's headphones right you do know

7583.28 --> 7589.5199999999995
that like headphones

7585.04 --> 7592.88
you know they've been out there for like

7589.52 --> 7594.88
what is it sixty nine probably a hundred

7592.88 --> 7605.84
years now

7594.88 --> 7605.84
it's no excuse

7613.76 --> 7620.2390000000005
hey and besides it's in the rules

7618.0 --> 7620.239
right

7621.44 --> 7627.839999999999
see just scroll down in the description

7625.04 --> 7631.199
box of the youtube right

7627.84 --> 7633.28
second to last hagglers

7631.199 --> 7635.36
not following the show and harassing

7633.28 --> 7637.44
chat participants will be banned

7635.36 --> 7639.199
if you're in my chat i may choose to

7637.44 --> 7641.598999999999
test you by addressing you

7639.199 --> 7644.638999999999
failure to comply with instructions will

7641.599 --> 7646.96
result in banning

7644.639 --> 7648.88
that rule has been there for several

7646.96 --> 7650.719
months

7648.88 --> 7652.079
right if you don't read the description

7650.719 --> 7655.44
box

7652.079 --> 7657.679
that's your problem there's rules

7655.44 --> 7658.638999999999
and those rules need to be followed

7657.679 --> 7660.96
otherwise

7658.639 --> 7662.96
yeah there's gonna be chaos and trolls

7660.96 --> 7666.88
are just gonna ravage everything

7662.96 --> 7666.88
and take everybody's concentration away

7667.04 --> 7670.8
hey julio papan good to see you

7671.84 --> 7675.84
alexandro gonzalez

7680.159 --> 7684.0
it seems like your chat is slow because

7683.28 --> 7689.04
i been

7684.0 --> 7692.32
wrote that what oh there's

7689.04 --> 7693.199
some sloth in chat well there is slow

7692.32 --> 7695.119
mode

7693.199 --> 7698.239
but it's just five seconds that should

7695.119 --> 7698.239
not be a real problem

7698.88 --> 7704.2390000000005
it's only to prevent like instant

7701.119 --> 7706.96
spammers that are just gonna

7704.239 --> 7706.959999999999
well spam

7712.96 --> 7718.96
right so amanda did you plan to send a

7716.0 --> 7720.32
second paypal because i still haven't

7718.96 --> 7723.04
received it or

7720.32 --> 7725.199
did you not hear me shout out when you

7723.04 --> 7731.84
sent the first one

7725.199 --> 7731.839999999999
maybe you missed that

7742.84 --> 7745.84
so

7746.8 --> 7750.75
all right

7747.7 --> 7750.75
[Music]

7754.239 --> 7758.0
our our leader it's gonna take some

7757.599 --> 7761.28
getting

7758.0 --> 7765.19
used to to hear people

7761.28 --> 7767.599
say that but you paid for it so

7765.19 --> 7769.919999999999
[Music]

7767.599 --> 7773.28
i guess they have to hold up my end of

7769.92 --> 7777.04
the bargain

7773.28 --> 7777.04
it's better than a pit i hope

7777.83 --> 7780.899
[Music]

7782.4 --> 7789.199
but yes i do my best to shine

7786.239 --> 7789.759999999999
light on real science real empiricism

7789.199 --> 7792.879999999999
real

7789.76 --> 7795.599
reasoning because i i'm not just

7792.88 --> 7797.76
physics only right i'm also into

7795.599 --> 7801.84
spiritual mechanics i'm also into

7797.76 --> 7801.84
personal development and

7801.92 --> 7806.56
yeah com complex philosophical

7805.44 --> 7810.079
perspectives

7806.56 --> 7812.079000000001
on things i i draw on as much as i can

7810.079 --> 7813.28
but physics i've always held it in high

7812.079 --> 7816.5599999999995
regard never

7813.28 --> 7819.04
thought like oh physics stupid

7816.56 --> 7819.92
physics for stupid nerds with books and

7819.04 --> 7822.639
glasses no

7819.92 --> 7824.079
no no physics is important it is it's

7822.639 --> 7827.1990000000005
like

7824.079 --> 7828.0
it is like that freaking anchor that

7827.199 --> 7831.04
prevents you

7828.0 --> 7832.32
from just wandering off in freakazoid

7831.04 --> 7834.96
land

7832.32 --> 7835.44
and getting caught up in cult [ __ ] right

7834.96 --> 7838.96
that's

7835.44 --> 7841.36
physics that's for me what physics makes

7838.96 --> 7842.8
what makes physics so important is that

7841.36 --> 7846.799999999999
the realness is like

7842.8 --> 7850.56
it's the physical anchor that keeps you

7846.8 --> 7852.719
real to know these things to know

7850.56 --> 7854.56
science the scientific method to know

7852.719 --> 7857.36
the the natural laws

7854.56 --> 7859.119000000001
to have an oversight over what is and

7857.36 --> 7862.88
what is not

7859.119 --> 7864.799999999999
and also realize that even in that field

7862.88 --> 7866.719
in the development and the research and

7864.8 --> 7870.0
the conceptions there are

7866.719 --> 7872.88
plenty of people that are trying to

7870.0 --> 7874.88
undo it that are trying to get away from

7872.88 --> 7876.079
that that are actually trying to scoop

7874.88 --> 7878.159000000001
that anchor

7876.079 --> 7879.599
out of the ground so they can finally

7878.159 --> 7881.759999999999
float off in

7879.599 --> 7884.4800000000005
science fiction land right that's

7881.76 --> 7888.0
happening too everywhere it is happening

7884.48 --> 7888.48
out there in the the globe religion

7888.0 --> 7892.079
world

7888.48 --> 7895.5199999999995
a lot but also among

7892.079 --> 7898.88
anybody like flat earthers

7895.52 --> 7901.92
flat earthers do that too because yeah

7898.88 --> 7905.52
dreams man it's

7901.92 --> 7907.4400000000005
yeah it's like this

7905.52 --> 7909.84
conundrum where you're faced with

7907.44 --> 7911.759999999999
something

7909.84 --> 7914.639
that's suggestive and then it's like

7911.76 --> 7916.96
yeah but why if it's not real then why

7914.639 --> 7920.159000000001
is this there then why are we perceiving

7916.96 --> 7922.159
this why are we measuring this right

7920.159 --> 7924.799999999999
it's it's the seduction it's it's

7922.159 --> 7928.879999999999
literally lucifer seducing you it's like

7924.8 --> 7930.96
yeah but see all these aberrations

7928.88 --> 7933.28
it's just that yeah if you want to

7930.96 --> 7936.4800000000005
understand it you have to let go

7933.28 --> 7936.8
of the old notions you have to let go of

7936.48 --> 7940.0
the

7936.8 --> 7943.360000000001
the anchor drop stop like cut the

7940.0 --> 7946.159
anchor loose it's lucifer seducing you

7943.36 --> 7950.239
to step away from the true foundation

7946.159 --> 7953.36
so you can pursue aberrations

7950.239 --> 7956.159
bizarre conundrums things

7953.36 --> 7959.04
that you bump into within mathematics

7956.159 --> 7961.598999999999
and within research within modeling

7959.04 --> 7962.8
that aren't actually tied into anything

7961.599 --> 7964.639
physically real

7962.8 --> 7967.76
it's like virtual structures that are

7964.639 --> 7970.8
very useful like the concept

7967.76 --> 7973.360000000001
of the force of gravity like it's a

7970.8 --> 7973.360000000001
concept

7976.0 --> 7981.84
it's an aberration it's an aberration

7978.719 --> 7986.079
that's been endlessly refined

7981.84 --> 7989.119000000001
scientism heliocentrism

7986.079 --> 7991.119
priests through school

7989.119 --> 7993.199
indoctrinated but it's an aberration

7991.119 --> 7994.639
it's not actually a physical thing it's

7993.199 --> 7998.159
a concept it's

7994.639 --> 8000.0
a measurement or a calculation tool that

7998.159 --> 8003.36
works out just great

8000.0 --> 8007.199
it works out fine for a lot of things

8003.36 --> 8009.598999999999
but it's not real it's an aberration

8007.199 --> 8011.28
and yeah so many people just don't like

8009.599 --> 8013.360000000001
that

8011.28 --> 8014.96
so they either throw it out immediately

8013.36 --> 8018.48
never talk about it again

8014.96 --> 8021.599
or they're like but but but it's

8018.48 --> 8023.5199999999995
it's there why does it work

8021.599 --> 8025.84
why does it work it has to be there so

8023.52 --> 8027.1990000000005
it has to be real so we can't rely on

8025.84 --> 8029.92
physics

8027.199 --> 8031.5199999999995
to define things anymore because this is

8029.92 --> 8034.719
there it has to be real

8031.52 --> 8036.639
let's find somehow the proof for that

8034.719 --> 8039.76
it's real and it's physical

8036.639 --> 8041.52
right no yeah there's several pretty

8039.76 --> 8044.2390000000005
prominent people out there now even in

8041.52 --> 8047.280000000001
the among flat earthers that have spent

8044.239 --> 8050.32
a lot of time doing just that

8047.28 --> 8051.199
and with it being seduced by lucifer not

8050.32 --> 8055.44
talking about

8051.199 --> 8058.5599999999995
satanic lucifer talking about

8055.44 --> 8059.598999999999
rudolf steiner conception lucifer right

8058.56 --> 8062.2390000000005
this is a distinction

8059.599 --> 8063.04
lucifer and every man aaron death

8062.239 --> 8066.0
lucifer

8063.04 --> 8068.239
seduction it's very specific right so

8066.0 --> 8069.84
yeah seductions seductions around every

8068.239 --> 8072.4
corner

8069.84 --> 8073.52
and the seduction will be around every

8072.4 --> 8076.4
corner to make you

8073.52 --> 8078.84
let go that anchor of the scientific

8076.4 --> 8083.04
method and physical

8078.84 --> 8087.04
reality the rules the laws

8083.04 --> 8089.36
that show you what is real what is not

8087.04 --> 8092.079
in order to pursue these fantastical

8089.36 --> 8095.839999999999
aberrations that you bump into

8092.079 --> 8095.84
during your research

8096.159 --> 8100.32
just like besides gravity the ether the

8099.599 --> 8103.04
light

8100.32 --> 8104.239
medium-based ether is is another one of

8103.04 --> 8106.239
these aberrations

8104.239 --> 8108.32
it's so suggestive there's things

8106.239 --> 8113.04
there's unique

8108.32 --> 8116.239
man-made conjured phenomena

8113.04 --> 8118.159
that can never be found in nature

8116.239 --> 8120.0
so it's not scientific but it's like

8118.159 --> 8123.28
what are these phenomena what is this

8120.0 --> 8124.48
why did it seem to rotate with the ring

8123.28 --> 8126.8
laser gyro you know

8124.48 --> 8127.598999999999
like why why it has to be an ether it

8126.8 --> 8130.0
has to be that

8127.599 --> 8131.76
has to be this and that and then that

8130.0 --> 8135.04
well

8131.76 --> 8136.96
no it's a phenomenon

8135.04 --> 8138.639
it's just not a natural phenomenon you

8136.96 --> 8144.159
can't derive anything

8138.639 --> 8147.1990000000005
physics related from it and besides

8144.159 --> 8149.119
light doesn't need another medium it

8147.199 --> 8151.759999999999
already has a medium

8149.119 --> 8154.32
the medium is matter matter is the

8151.76 --> 8157.76
medium for light it doesn't need

8154.32 --> 8165.5199999999995
another thing in order

8157.76 --> 8169.599
to function the way it does

8165.52 --> 8169.599
satan is air loss what no

8170.079 --> 8175.599
that's no no i was being very specific

8173.76 --> 8178.88
moth eyes about

8175.599 --> 8182.8
basically spiritual cosmology

8178.88 --> 8183.36
very specific satan is not involved in

8182.8 --> 8187.52
that

8183.36 --> 8189.598999999999
like lucifer and iron man are satan

8187.52 --> 8190.8
it's just that there's very different

8189.599 --> 8194.8
natures to them

8190.8 --> 8194.8
and it's important to distinguish

8195.599 --> 8202.479
in order to help recognize it right

8199.04 --> 8205.439
because it's very different but

8202.479 --> 8206.96
like even rudolf steiner i hear this a

8205.439 --> 8207.599
lot through my healer because i don't

8206.96 --> 8209.438999999998
have any

8207.599 --> 8210.880000000001
rule of steiner books which i regret it

8209.439 --> 8211.679
would have been nice to have some to

8210.88 --> 8214.319
read

8211.679 --> 8215.84
but just i get it i get rid of i get

8214.319 --> 8218.559
what he's doing

8215.84 --> 8220.559
this is my thing too and i haven't even

8218.559 --> 8223.599
read it i know it is

8220.559 --> 8227.358999999999
and this works the iron man and lucifer

8223.599 --> 8230.559
system works very well

8227.359 --> 8233.439
and lucifer if you give in to him

8230.559 --> 8236.16
unfortunately with whatever intention it

8233.439 --> 8239.04
will always lead to ironman

8236.16 --> 8239.76
not absolute death but it will always

8239.04 --> 8243.28
take away

8239.76 --> 8245.439
first you get more then you lose

8243.28 --> 8246.399000000001
and then you will have a whole of having

8245.439 --> 8249.04
known more

8246.399 --> 8251.279999999999
and then having lost it and that's what

8249.04 --> 8253.599
lucifer typically does

8251.28 --> 8254.960000000001
give you and only to take it away or

8253.599 --> 8256.880000000001
have it taken away

8254.96 --> 8259.199999999999
from arimon because everyone doesn't

8256.88 --> 8263.839999999998
want anyone to have anything

8259.2 --> 8263.84
it just wants death of everything

8270.559 --> 8278.08
right kyram is water

8274.08 --> 8279.2
man is what chiron is water man is earth

8278.08 --> 8283.28
wet

8279.2 --> 8283.28
now this is this is kind of like

8283.359 --> 8286.639000000001
yeah they're getting kind of like hippy

8285.92 --> 8290.08
dippy

8286.639 --> 8291.759999999998
elementalist stuff there i i don't do

8290.08 --> 8295.519
that anymore

8291.76 --> 8296.319
right the system for iron man and

8295.519 --> 8299.359
lucifer is

8296.319 --> 8302.319
very specific and it's very real

8299.359 --> 8303.12
it's nothing vague hippy dippy about

8302.319 --> 8308.0
that [ __ ]

8303.12 --> 8310.800000000001
at all it's real it works like that

8308.0 --> 8313.12
it's just a description of a spiritual

8310.8 --> 8313.92
effect and structure of things that are

8313.12 --> 8317.439
real and that

8313.92 --> 8320.559
really happen happen within

8317.439 --> 8320.559000000001
us through us

8326.479 --> 8330.559
the four births out of the body of ram

8329.28 --> 8347.84
oh okay

8330.559 --> 8347.84
hindu cosmology then sorry

8349.84 --> 8353.92
ether don't work though cool idea oh

8352.24 --> 8358.639
really akumovirus

8353.92 --> 8362.719000000001
are you saying ether doesn't work okay

8358.639 --> 8362.719
good to know i think

8367.599 --> 8371.439
what did you miss amanda young

8372.96 --> 8379.678999999998
yeah 130 watching that's quite a lot

8376.399 --> 8383.279999999999
i think it's probably because

8379.679 --> 8383.28
nathan is not doing a live stream

8383.519 --> 8389.12
but i'm glad to take his extra viewers

8386.88 --> 8391.679999999998
and the chat's been really good today so

8389.12 --> 8393.2
i thank you all

8391.68 --> 8395.92
for being part of that i'm still going

8393.2 --> 8399.2
to continue another

8395.92 --> 8399.2
30 minutes at least

8400.84 --> 8406.24
hmm i'm also going to take a two minute

8404.08 --> 8417.84
break again

8406.24 --> 8417.84
so this tea is coming out

8456.84 --> 8459.84
so

8533.12 --> 8536.240000000002
all right welcome back

8540.96 --> 8545.119999999999
okay moth ice you're not sure we can

8543.68 --> 8549.6
rule out ether

8545.12 --> 8549.6
but it needs defining uh

8550.88 --> 8555.519999999999
you know you're literally contradicting

8552.8 --> 8559.358999999999
yourself in that sentence right

8555.52 --> 8561.2
so if you don't even know how to define

8559.359 --> 8564.319
it how can you

8561.2 --> 8566.720000000001
rule it out you haven't defined anything

8564.319 --> 8569.68
to rule it out

8566.72 --> 8570.88
see it's very similar to the concept of

8569.68 --> 8572.880000000001
gravity it's like

8570.88 --> 8574.64
oh gravity has to be there because we've

8572.88 --> 8577.358999999999
been taught gravity and

8574.64 --> 8578.72
newtonian mechanics and einstein but

8577.359 --> 8582.16
we're still

8578.72 --> 8584.96
trying to find what it is

8582.16 --> 8585.439
right that's not the right order of

8584.96 --> 8588.72
doing

8585.439 --> 8591.84
things in physics right

8588.72 --> 8592.88
you don't assume something is there and

8591.84 --> 8597.2
then try to

8592.88 --> 8601.039999999999
find out what it is that makes no sense

8597.2 --> 8604.800000000001
either you know something

8601.04 --> 8608.160000000002
and then you're gonna try to devise

8604.8 --> 8611.199999999999
a theory about it and then see

8608.16 --> 8613.28
if it works but

8611.2 --> 8615.52
if you're already assuming something is

8613.28 --> 8617.04
there and you don't even know what it is

8615.52 --> 8619.04
yet

8617.04 --> 8620.880000000001
that's not the right order of doing

8619.04 --> 8623.68
things

8620.88 --> 8627.839999999998
that's literally chasing a dragon or an

8623.68 --> 8627.84
aberration if you will

8632.64 --> 8637.439
now if you would state that something is

8635.76 --> 8640.479
there

8637.439 --> 8643.92
like hey the man-made device

8640.479 --> 8644.72
ether rotation assumption thing there is

8643.92 --> 8646.399
something there

8644.72 --> 8648.56
something happening it's like yeah of

8646.399 --> 8650.399
course something is happening

8648.56 --> 8652.16
of course it is it's like it's right

8650.399 --> 8655.199999999999
there it seems to happen

8652.16 --> 8658.319
right does that mean either

8655.2 --> 8661.359
no it is kind of assumed

8658.319 --> 8664.72
to be ether because of other reasons

8661.359 --> 8667.04
because ether is

8664.72 --> 8669.358999999999
in the want to be there in order for

8667.04 --> 8672.560000000001
light to be a wave and get that

8669.359 --> 8674.720000000001
issue the conundrum within physics about

8672.56 --> 8678.16
the nature of light out of the way

8674.72 --> 8681.119999999999
that's why ether is necessary

8678.16 --> 8682.0
for certain people that they need to

8681.12 --> 8684.479000000001
believe that

8682.0 --> 8687.52
in order to get away from the conundrum

8684.479 --> 8687.519999999999
of the nature of light

8688.88 --> 8691.119999999999
right

8693.12 --> 8697.04
but doesn't mean that just because you

8695.2 --> 8699.92
have something

8697.04 --> 8700.720000000001
that happens involving in light that is

8699.92 --> 8703.04
yeah conjured

8700.72 --> 8703.76
within a manmade device that doesn't

8703.04 --> 8706.880000000001
mean that

8703.76 --> 8708.56
it is either it's just assumed to be

8706.88 --> 8711.358999999999
ether

8708.56 --> 8712.8
even though ether has no necessity for

8711.359 --> 8715.6
even existing

8712.8 --> 8716.479
because light doesn't need a medium

8715.6 --> 8719.04
other

8716.479 --> 8720.399
than matter matter is the medium for

8719.04 --> 8725.84
light

8720.399 --> 8725.84
right that's it

8737.12 --> 8740.319000000001
well the the misunderstanding really

8739.439 --> 8744.64
comes

8740.319 --> 8747.76
forth from this weird train of thought

8744.64 --> 8753.439
where just because you can shoot light

8747.76 --> 8756.08
through a vacuum then that means that

8753.439 --> 8757.6
there has to be something else that

8756.08 --> 8759.76
propels it

8757.6 --> 8760.800000000001
right that's the assumption it is kind

8759.76 --> 8764.08
of the

8760.8 --> 8766.64
reification of

8764.08 --> 8767.52
light being a wave comparing it to

8766.64 --> 8770.56
literally

8767.52 --> 8773.84
a wave like in water

8770.56 --> 8774.88
where the wave is secondary to the

8773.84 --> 8778.479
material

8774.88 --> 8780.64
the water right the wave is a wave

8778.479 --> 8782.16
of the water and by that train of

8780.64 --> 8784.96
thinking

8782.16 --> 8786.64
people have reified light supposedly

8784.96 --> 8787.199999999999
being a wave even though it's not really

8786.64 --> 8791.039999999999
a wave

8787.2 --> 8793.76
it just has wave function

8791.04 --> 8795.6
apparent wave function by that train of

8793.76 --> 8799.12
thinking they assume there has

8795.6 --> 8802.399000000001
it has to be a wave

8799.12 --> 8805.6
of something else not understanding that

8802.399 --> 8807.68
no it has matter

8805.6 --> 8808.800000000001
it light goes through matter the medium

8807.68 --> 8813.28
for light

8808.8 --> 8815.84
is matter and just because it moves

8813.28 --> 8817.92
more unabsorbed and abated through a

8815.84 --> 8820.8
vacuum

8817.92 --> 8822.08
doesn't mean that there has to be

8820.8 --> 8826.16
another medium

8822.08 --> 8828.72
it's just not conventional it's just not

8826.16 --> 8832.0
comparable to waves in matter

8828.72 --> 8835.358999999999
it's different it's light light is weird

8832.0 --> 8851.84
light is unique it's there it has no

8835.359 --> 8851.84
mass yet it's there

8854.56 --> 8859.84
energy can only be produced by a

8856.88 --> 8859.839999999998
physical object

8862.84 --> 8868.56
uh

8865.52 --> 8868.560000000001
i don't know about that

8870.72 --> 8874.0
there's all kinds of electric energy in

8873.2 --> 8876.319000000001
the air

8874.0 --> 8877.439
that's not really being created by a

8876.319 --> 8880.479
physical object

8877.439 --> 8881.52
it's there it's part of the realm one

8880.479 --> 8884.56
could argue that

8881.52 --> 8886.720000000001
god the designer has

8884.56 --> 8887.68
set it up that there would be energy or

8886.72 --> 8891.119999999999
he's literally

8887.68 --> 8894.319
inserting the energy that then

8891.12 --> 8897.6
cascades into the energy

8894.319 --> 8900.96
that is here right

8897.6 --> 8903.84
but to state all energy must be

8900.96 --> 8905.199999999999
physically produced oh really based on

8903.84 --> 8907.68
what

8905.2 --> 8910.720000000001
on the non-physical object sun that you

8907.68 --> 8910.720000000001
can triangulate

8913.12 --> 8921.84
i don't think so

8927.359 --> 8934.24
before the universe existed what

8931.52 --> 8936.16
is that a question to uh professor phil

8934.24 --> 8938.319
bell in chat

8936.16 --> 8940.16
before the universe existed did

8938.319 --> 8941.439
everything suddenly appear without using

8940.16 --> 8943.76
energy

8941.439 --> 8943.76
what

8945.2 --> 8949.52
well i think that within the big bang

8947.439 --> 8952.479000000001
idea

8949.52 --> 8955.76
it's just an idea very silly idea what

8952.479 --> 8958.399
is suggested is that it all

8955.76 --> 8960.0
critically masked like a giant black

8958.399 --> 8963.039999999999
hole collapsing on itself

8960.0 --> 8966.399
until physicality was

8963.04 --> 8968.319000000001
all reduced to a singular non-existent

8966.399 --> 8970.96
point within space

8968.319 --> 8972.319
and then with that consuming all the

8970.96 --> 8974.88
energy

8972.319 --> 8977.039999999999
ever existing and that would cause the

8974.88 --> 8978.16
critical mass and the reversal of the

8977.04 --> 8981.84
process

8978.16 --> 8983.6
resulting in a universal explosion the

8981.84 --> 8986.880000000001
big bang

8983.6 --> 8989.359
something like that right but even with

8986.88 --> 8991.839999999998
the big bang theorists

8989.359 --> 8992.479000000001
they say like it's probably not really

8991.84 --> 8994.8
the start

8992.479 --> 8996.8
it's probably just one out of multiple

8994.8 --> 8997.679999999998
big bangs and the big bang is like a

8996.8 --> 9000.56
universe

8997.68 --> 9001.439
engine so it keeps on boom everything is

9000.56 --> 9003.119999999999
there and then oh

9001.439 --> 9004.960000000001
black holes start to form it all starts

9003.12 --> 9006.560000000001
to get together and then

9004.96 --> 9008.64
it goes back to the black hole point

9006.56 --> 9011.76
again and then boom over again

9008.64 --> 9015.119999999999
right a universe engine

9011.76 --> 9016.399
that's at least what i thought would be

9015.12 --> 9018.640000000001
the most logical

9016.399 --> 9033.84
when i still thought that heliocentrism

9018.64 --> 9033.84
and the big bang was real

9035.28 --> 9040.560000000001
god must have used energy to create

9037.28 --> 9040.560000000001
everyone you betcha

9043.52 --> 9048.0
okay el juncker this is quite a

9045.6 --> 9052.319
universal question there

9048.0 --> 9055.52
why are we on earth what's the use

9052.319 --> 9058.16
don't know why the pause in there your

9055.52 --> 9058.16
take on it

9058.24 --> 9064.0
why are we in earth what's the use it's

9061.28 --> 9069.68
a learning process

9064.0 --> 9072.72
right so what's the use

9069.68 --> 9075.76
what it depends on the offset of

9072.72 --> 9076.479
your cosmology of everything including

9075.76 --> 9080.479
the spirits

9076.479 --> 9082.479
including god from my perspective

9080.479 --> 9086.24
the preponderance of everything i think

9082.479 --> 9086.24
that we are here to experience

9086.88 --> 9093.438999999998
and learn experience

9090.0 --> 9097.84
simplicity limited

9093.439 --> 9097.84
limitation error

9098.399 --> 9104.16
grief and joy and then

9101.84 --> 9105.439
yeah as a separated spirit because i

9104.16 --> 9107.439
think that every

9105.439 --> 9109.12
part of our consciousness originated

9107.439 --> 9112.16
from the creator

9109.12 --> 9115.04
like we are a part of the creator of

9112.16 --> 9116.399
its spirit that it's like specifically

9115.04 --> 9119.439
designated

9116.399 --> 9123.199999999999
like it has us but it took like a

9119.439 --> 9127.92
a piece of itself separated it

9123.2 --> 9130.640000000001
and like not like

9127.92 --> 9133.12
or rather maybe this separation is a

9130.64 --> 9134.88
difficult word not really separated

9133.12 --> 9136.960000000001
it's rather just take a part of its

9134.88 --> 9138.8
spirit almost like clone that

9136.96 --> 9140.24
and then that they made our

9138.8 --> 9142.84
consciousness

9140.24 --> 9144.16
then created the physical realm a

9142.84 --> 9147.52
sub-realm

9144.16 --> 9151.359
in order to have all these experiences

9147.52 --> 9154.800000000001
now why that depends on why god

9151.359 --> 9158.640000000001
exists why the creator exists

9154.8 --> 9162.56
there might be a super cosmology

9158.64 --> 9165.439
a part of which god is a part

9162.56 --> 9165.84
right an added creation in our earth

9165.439 --> 9169.6
realm

9165.84 --> 9173.84
and everything would be like a sub-realm

9169.6 --> 9177.2
to it and maybe we are all part

9173.84 --> 9179.92
literally of god like that and maybe we

9177.2 --> 9180.640000000001
are an integral intric intrinsic

9179.92 --> 9183.68
learning

9180.64 --> 9187.039999999999
part that god requires of

9183.68 --> 9190.319
us in order to move forward in the

9187.04 --> 9192.720000000001
super cosmology of which god

9190.319 --> 9195.039999999999
the creator himself may be a part he

9192.72 --> 9198.16
might be one of many

9195.04 --> 9200.720000000001
there not on earth

9198.16 --> 9201.68
creator is exclusive to earth pretty

9200.72 --> 9204.88
sure about that

9201.68 --> 9204.880000000001
but beyond

9205.439 --> 9210.64
i don't know but yeah that's assuming

9208.16 --> 9214.319
that there is a super cosmology

9210.64 --> 9214.8
beyond the earth realm and the spiritual

9214.319 --> 9218.08
realm

9214.8 --> 9218.08
as a reflection of it

9219.12 --> 9224.800000000001
so yeah it's quite a complicated uh

9223.12 --> 9226.800000000001
issue there el young thanks for the

9224.8 --> 9230.88
question though it's it's good to

9226.8 --> 9230.88
to go through that for a moment

9238.08 --> 9243.84
thanks for your answer yeah you're

9239.76 --> 9243.84
welcome thank you for your question

9268.84 --> 9271.84
hmm

9273.76 --> 9278.08
right well i see it like this it's god's

9277.04 --> 9280.640000000001
concern right

9278.08 --> 9282.08
the creator like absolute god not a

9280.64 --> 9285.439
pantheon a god no

9282.08 --> 9286.56
the god everything alpha and omega it's

9285.439 --> 9288.64
up to him

9286.56 --> 9290.319
like he might be part of something

9288.64 --> 9293.84
bigger it's not enough

9290.319 --> 9297.279999999999
not any of our business though that's

9293.84 --> 9298.0
because any of that he is i'm pretty

9297.28 --> 9300.880000000001
sure he

9298.0 --> 9302.24
if that exists he shielded the earth and

9300.88 --> 9304.319
its existence off

9302.24 --> 9306.08
from influences from the outside

9304.319 --> 9309.76
completely

9306.08 --> 9313.84
right the earth is his his alone

9309.76 --> 9313.84
his realm

9314.96 --> 9322.08
but he may need us

9318.16 --> 9322.08
for the over realm

9323.04 --> 9329.439
right as we are

9326.16 --> 9332.88
designated to exist develop learn

9329.439 --> 9335.84
go through all these trials so might

9332.88 --> 9338.64
the creator the alpha and omega to us

9335.84 --> 9338.64
have his own

9339.68 --> 9347.359
thing that he

9342.72 --> 9347.358999999999
is involved with in the over dimension

9348.64 --> 9352.72
could be not saying it is per definition

9351.439 --> 9355.92
right it could be that

9352.72 --> 9358.56
he literally is all there is

9355.92 --> 9361.04
i'm just saying and keeping up open my

9358.56 --> 9361.039999999999
options

9361.439 --> 9367.439
because they could be it could be there

9364.88 --> 9368.24
it's just not something that we within

9367.439 --> 9370.08
our lifetime

9368.24 --> 9372.0
would ever really need to concern

9370.08 --> 9373.84
ourselves with because nothing out there

9372.0 --> 9375.6
would be able to influence us

9373.84 --> 9379.68
as we would not be able to influence

9375.6 --> 9379.68
anything out there except for god

9381.6 --> 9386.479000000001
you could even make it a little sillier

9384.56 --> 9389.68
and say that maybe

9386.479 --> 9392.96
terra the earth this

9389.68 --> 9398.319
realm this physical creation is like

9392.96 --> 9398.319
god's school project

9398.88 --> 9404.319
right it's not that tough to imagine

9401.76 --> 9406.64
this at least it does make it feel a

9404.319 --> 9408.72
little silly and undignified perhaps but

9406.64 --> 9411.92
maybe it is

9408.72 --> 9414.96
maybe we are god's school project

9411.92 --> 9425.84
who knows it's not really any of our

9414.96 --> 9425.839999999998
concern though

9437.92 --> 9444.64
okay i'm not gonna tell that

9441.2 --> 9448.08
and i think that things like small

9444.64 --> 9450.72
boy or man or

9448.08 --> 9451.76
woman or i think that those things are

9450.72 --> 9455.679999999998
kind of

9451.76 --> 9458.0
potentially god's constructions within

9455.68 --> 9460.56
the design of physicality

9458.0 --> 9461.04
i don't think any of that in any way

9460.56 --> 9464.319
really

9461.04 --> 9467.28
exists beyond our physical realm

9464.319 --> 9469.119999999999
and the spiritual correlating realm the

9467.28 --> 9473.439
other dimension on top of that

9469.12 --> 9477.2
i think that's unique to our existence

9473.439 --> 9481.359
right so to call him that would be

9477.2 --> 9484.479000000001
like well

9481.359 --> 9484.479000000001
earthifying him

9484.56 --> 9491.84
he's the alpha and omega he potentially

9488.08 --> 9494.16
as a concept invented everything that we

9491.84 --> 9497.6
take for granted within existed

9494.16 --> 9498.479
like as in it may have never existed any

9497.6 --> 9502.24
element of it

9498.479 --> 9505.358999999999
outside ever beyond his design

9502.24 --> 9506.24
we don't know that so to assume that

9505.359 --> 9509.52
everything

9506.24 --> 9511.28
is in a similar structure as earth

9509.52 --> 9514.319000000001
creation is outside of

9511.28 --> 9523.84
earth creation would be

9514.319 --> 9523.84
yeah just that an assumption

9534.84 --> 9537.84
right

9551.04 --> 9554.160000000002
well alyon could

9555.92 --> 9560.64
it gets really weird when i start to tap

9558.16 --> 9564.16
into my dark world visions some of which

9560.64 --> 9567.199999999999
were extremely distinct

9564.16 --> 9569.439
i did actually kind of remember just

9567.2 --> 9571.04
looking over what seemed to be like a

9569.439 --> 9575.359
strategic

9571.04 --> 9575.359
table of the earth

9576.319 --> 9579.84
almost like it was the realm

9580.8 --> 9586.399
it had no top though so it was probably

9582.96 --> 9586.399
a virtual representation

9588.24 --> 9593.84
but yeah i can't prove that that was

9594.16 --> 9599.28
not it would have have to be still based

9596.8 --> 9601.679999999998
on reflections of the physical realm so

9599.28 --> 9603.76
the spiritual realm not

9601.68 --> 9604.880000000001
the place from which the creator

9603.76 --> 9607.84
designer origin

9604.88 --> 9607.839999999998
originated

9611.2 --> 9615.04
which is probably another dimension or

9618.84 --> 9621.84
whatever

9624.16 --> 9627.52
what do you mean by the dark place not

9626.24 --> 9630.64
the dark place

9627.52 --> 9635.04
the dark world that's how i call it the

9630.64 --> 9638.72
dark world

9635.04 --> 9640.880000000001
it is arguably related to dmt

9638.72 --> 9643.358999999999
although i didn't know that or ayahuasca

9640.88 --> 9646.96
or just my pineal gland activities

9643.359 --> 9648.24
because i've had well dark world related

9646.96 --> 9651.358999999999
experience

9648.24 --> 9654.24
before i have ever touched any

9651.359 --> 9654.24
of those things

9654.96 --> 9658.319
like throughout my youth and i kept it a

9657.12 --> 9660.720000000001
secret because

9658.319 --> 9663.84
the things in those experience told me

9660.72 --> 9663.84
to keep it a secret

9664.24 --> 9668.399
that's yeah how freaking weird is that

9671.439 --> 9674.880000000001
but in retrospect from what i've heard

9673.84 --> 9676.880000000001
from my healer

9674.88 --> 9678.24
it's very likely that it was literally

9676.88 --> 9680.399
iron man

9678.24 --> 9690.88
like claiming me from within that realm

9680.399 --> 9693.358999999999
trying to

9690.88 --> 9696.08
it's complicated it's all very very

9693.359 --> 9696.08
complicated

9701.12 --> 9704.720000000001
but why i called it the dark world

9703.04 --> 9706.720000000001
originally is because

9704.72 --> 9709.438999999998
one thing really stood out to me during

9706.72 --> 9711.519999999999
those experiences and that is that

9709.439 --> 9712.960000000001
there were no celestial lights that i

9711.52 --> 9715.359
could ever see ever

9712.96 --> 9717.199999999999
not the sun not the moon no stars

9715.359 --> 9720.319
nothing it would always be

9717.2 --> 9722.720000000001
a black backdrop there might be light

9720.319 --> 9725.519999999999
it didn't come from anywhere things were

9722.72 --> 9725.519999999999
just lit up

9726.0 --> 9730.24
it's very hard to even explain what that

9728.96 --> 9732.479
was like

9730.24 --> 9734.08
there was no celestial lights anywhere

9732.479 --> 9737.119999999999
it was just black

9734.08 --> 9737.52
like a holodeck in which everything is

9737.12 --> 9739.12
black

9737.52 --> 9743.439
except for the things that were

9739.12 --> 9745.68
apparently manifested for me to perceive

9743.439 --> 9746.720000000001
did you receive a paper oh ralph

9745.68 --> 9749.279
rodriguez

9746.72 --> 9749.278999999999
let me check

9754.72 --> 9757.519999999999
yes i did

9757.84 --> 9761.84
i think what is that

9763.76 --> 9766.479
i'm not sure

9772.399 --> 9778.24
or was that a paypal another time

9775.84 --> 9779.76
because i think so yes yes i remember

9778.24 --> 9780.96
that i think i got paypal from you

9779.76 --> 9782.56
yesterday didn't i

9780.96 --> 9786.08
yeah thank you very much man that was

9782.56 --> 9788.479
great thank you very much

9786.08 --> 9789.2
i'm really happy and thankful about all

9788.479 --> 9791.119999999999
this support

9789.2 --> 9792.640000000001
because i do freaking need it okay i

9791.12 --> 9794.880000000001
really do

9792.64 --> 9796.72
but it's just helping so much and then i

9794.88 --> 9797.199999999999
just don't have to worry so much about

9796.72 --> 9799.599999999999
all that

9797.2 --> 9799.6
crap

9801.2 --> 9805.12
get on and just have these great

9803.12 --> 9807.359
hangouts where i'm really fluid

9805.12 --> 9808.640000000001
and not just like i feel bad because i

9807.359 --> 9811.68
have to beg or

9808.64 --> 9814.96
and then that interrupts my flow

9811.68 --> 9816.319
of what i am really here to do so it's

9814.96 --> 9819.438999999998
great

9816.319 --> 9821.68
oh no you send one right now

9819.439 --> 9825.2
oh well i did get another paper but i

9821.68 --> 9825.2
think it was a man of youngs now

9825.68 --> 9831.84
let me check again

9839.04 --> 9842.240000000002
i got 16

9842.319 --> 9847.6
from who is that doesn't say

9856.84 --> 9859.84
what

9863.76 --> 9873.76
nathan richard 13 april

9866.88 --> 9877.92
right yes

9873.76 --> 9882.16
huh no what yeah

9877.92 --> 9887.84
that's weird that's not the amount

9882.16 --> 9887.84
that's strange

9891.279 --> 9895.84
huh well anyway yeah i got your paypal

9894.0 --> 9900.0
thank you very much man i really

9895.84 --> 9915.84
appreciate that

9900.0 --> 9915.84
hey chris berry good to see you in chat

9923.279 --> 9929.439
a gravitational field oh the science

9926.88 --> 9935.278999999999
fiction professor field bell

9929.439 --> 9935.279
the science fiction gravitational field

9936.56 --> 9944.08
oh right ralph rodriguez oh that yeah

9939.92 --> 9948.16
well arwen is my middle name right

9944.08 --> 9949.439
and since there's like millions of polls

9948.16 --> 9952.56
out there

9949.439 --> 9954.720000000001
i just prefer to stick to the actual

9952.56 --> 9956.24
unique name that nobody else out there

9954.72 --> 9961.199999999999
has ever seemed to have

9956.24 --> 9965.039999999999
attained that i got from my mother

9961.2 --> 9967.84
or rather that she offered me

9965.04 --> 9967.84
my middle name

9968.16 --> 9972.319
when i was a really little kid she asked

9970.08 --> 9975.68
me like would you like to be called that

9972.319 --> 9977.76
i was like what does that mean it means

9975.68 --> 9979.439
nectar of the gods and it's based on

9977.76 --> 9981.76
lord of the rings you could technically

9979.439 --> 9983.52
be considered a health elf

9981.76 --> 9985.68
within the lord of the rings and i she

9983.52 --> 9989.04
had read that book to me so i was like

9985.68 --> 9991.52
whoa that's awesome

9989.04 --> 9992.240000000002
yes i want to be that i'll give it my

9991.52 --> 9995.04
everything

9992.24 --> 9998.16
i'll be that name that's how funny how

9995.04 --> 10001.04
that worked out

9998.16 --> 10002.16
that was like when i was like three or

10001.04 --> 10004.960000000001
four

10002.16 --> 10004.96
she asked me that

10006.8 --> 10009.278999999999
i think

10010.319 --> 10015.359
or maybe that's when she first

10011.92 --> 10015.359
confronted me with the name

10016.16 --> 10019.92
because nobody ever called me that right

10018.64 --> 10023.76
it's just my front name

10019.92 --> 10023.76
people call me by my front name out here

10024.56 --> 10028.96
but on the internet as long as i'm doing

10027.2 --> 10030.319000000001
what i'm doing right here i just like to

10028.96 --> 10032.72
be called arwin

10030.319 --> 10034.64
that would be great because then

10032.72 --> 10034.96
immediately everybody will know exactly

10034.64 --> 10037.519999999999
who

10034.96 --> 10041.839999999998
who you're talking about right so that's

10037.52 --> 10041.84
much more helpful

10046.96 --> 10052.88
right but if you looked at the email

10050.319 --> 10054.56
that should tell you that it that it is

10052.88 --> 10058.96
me

10054.56 --> 10058.96
are win33 at gmail.com

10060.96 --> 10065.438999999998
that's what the paypal system is linked

10063.279 --> 10065.439
to

10066.84 --> 10069.84
uh

10076.399 --> 10083.119999999999
you go by your middle name what your

10079.12 --> 10086.240000000002
need mill name is akumu virus

10083.12 --> 10088.960000000001
are you kidding me that's

10086.24 --> 10088.96
ridiculous

10089.92 --> 10095.04
or is your middle name just akumu

10093.439 --> 10097.84
that will make a little bit more sense

10095.04 --> 10097.84
maybe

10116.0 --> 10120.0
we know exactly how light is formed

10118.08 --> 10122.72
except for the sunlight

10120.0 --> 10124.24
for fisherville except for the sunlight

10122.72 --> 10127.039999999999
yeah you don't know

10124.24 --> 10129.039999999999
i don't know nobody knows you certainly

10127.04 --> 10132.640000000001
don't know

10129.04 --> 10133.6
and whether or not there is a field that

10132.64 --> 10136.319
light

10133.6 --> 10137.2
waves are propagated with is

10136.319 --> 10139.439
preposterous

10137.2 --> 10140.560000000001
you know what that field is in which

10139.439 --> 10143.6
light is propagated

10140.56 --> 10146.88
it's called matter matter is

10143.6 --> 10148.319
the field is the medium in which light

10146.88 --> 10150.08
is propagated

10148.319 --> 10153.119999999999
right and it's not a wave and it's not a

10150.08 --> 10156.16
particle it's an infinitely divisible

10153.12 --> 10160.08
beam of energy

10156.16 --> 10163.119999999999
that can split up further

10160.08 --> 10165.76
than matter

10163.12 --> 10166.880000000001
and that's why matter will always be the

10165.76 --> 10169.6
limitation

10166.88 --> 10171.92
of registration of light because in

10169.6 --> 10172.880000000001
order to register light matter has to

10171.92 --> 10175.68
absorb

10172.88 --> 10178.16
a certain amount of energy from light in

10175.68 --> 10181.359
order to transform

10178.16 --> 10183.84
and pass on its registration

10181.359 --> 10185.359
right and since something that's

10183.84 --> 10188.399
infinitely divisible

10185.359 --> 10189.68
could split up beyond or below that

10188.399 --> 10193.199999999999
threshold

10189.68 --> 10195.6
yeah there will be light

10193.2 --> 10196.240000000002
that simply cannot be picked up in any

10195.6 --> 10198.800000000001
form

10196.24 --> 10200.08
unless you find extremely sensitive

10198.8 --> 10204.24
matter that could

10200.08 --> 10204.24
pick up lower thresholds of light

10205.439 --> 10209.84
so that's my theory about light

10210.08 --> 10216.16
it's not a wave it's not a particle it's

10211.92 --> 10222.8
an in beam of infinitely divisible

10216.16 --> 10237.84
light energy medium

10222.8 --> 10237.84
is matter

10242.399 --> 10246.16
gravity feel as a density table yeah

10244.64 --> 10250.24
that's a good one

10246.16 --> 10255.92
yeah it's a spectrum a spectrum of

10250.24 --> 10255.92
density equilibrium

10256.72 --> 10264.08
like where does the certain density

10260.319 --> 10266.0
where in the spectrum of things is the

10264.08 --> 10268.8
direction

10266.0 --> 10269.76
of that density layer and it just

10268.8 --> 10272.08
happens to

10269.76 --> 10274.16
be based on whatever is within the

10272.08 --> 10275.6
medium right whatever is in the realm

10274.16 --> 10277.76
that's really the only thing it's

10275.6 --> 10280.960000000001
dependent on if there was

10277.76 --> 10281.92
other materials then equilibrium points

10280.96 --> 10284.24
would also

10281.92 --> 10284.24
shift

10285.52 --> 10289.279
there was no air it was all water all

10287.52 --> 10291.279
filled up with water yeah there would be

10289.279 --> 10293.2
definitely a rearranging of the

10291.279 --> 10294.800000000001
materials

10293.2 --> 10297.52
because everything that's lighter than

10294.8 --> 10300.8
water less dense will then suddenly

10297.52 --> 10300.800000000001
start going to the top

10301.279 --> 10309.92
towards the boundary up there whatever

10306.479 --> 10309.92
it would be a whole different setup

10311.04 --> 10317.6
so it is all content dependent

10314.64 --> 10319.119999999999
how the density layers arrange

10317.6 --> 10321.84
themselves it is content

10319.12 --> 10321.84
dependent

10332.88 --> 10337.839999999998
uh so rufus don't do that

10336.08 --> 10340.96
don't do that or you're gonna seriously

10337.84 --> 10340.960000000001
piss me off right

10341.439 --> 10349.2
don't misquote me

10345.439 --> 10351.439
i never said non-existent sun did i say

10349.2 --> 10353.76
the sun doesn't exist

10351.439 --> 10355.359
anybody anybody in chat here that has

10353.76 --> 10357.68
watched in the last three hours

10355.359 --> 10362.880000000001
did i at any point say that the sun

10357.68 --> 10364.720000000001
didn't exist

10362.88 --> 10367.199999999999
pretty sure i said the sun is not an

10364.72 --> 10367.199999999999
object

10367.92 --> 10372.0
and there is no sun right

10372.16 --> 10375.6
and with that when i say there is no sun

10374.64 --> 10379.92
i'm pointing at

10375.6 --> 10383.12
the presumed physical object sun

10379.92 --> 10385.279
right i never said the sun doesn't exist

10383.12 --> 10387.84
yeah there is definitely an observation

10385.279 --> 10391.12
so don't put words in my mouth

10387.84 --> 10395.92
rufus or you're gonna go

10391.12 --> 10399.359
in the uh on the lower layer

10395.92 --> 10405.84
of chat participation

10399.359 --> 10405.84
don't misquote me

10415.12 --> 10418.319000000001
right there's definitely a phenomenon

10417.359 --> 10421.12
out there

10418.319 --> 10422.0
the sun disk right it's there it's a

10421.12 --> 10426.240000000002
thing

10422.0 --> 10429.76
right it's just not an object

10426.24 --> 10433.199999999999
and it's not the cause of the daylight

10429.76 --> 10436.24
or what we perceive as sunlight that

10433.2 --> 10440.0
seems to be coming from it

10436.24 --> 10442.08
sort of not really though

10440.0 --> 10443.76
it's coming from that direction that's

10442.08 --> 10447.84
as far as we can go

10443.76 --> 10447.84
with certainty

10458.0 --> 10463.2
right okay okay he said he thought he

10461.359 --> 10465.76
heard that well you were wrong and

10463.2 --> 10465.76
that's okay

10467.04 --> 10470.880000000001
as long as you correct yourself that's a

10472.84 --> 10475.84
virtue

10480.24 --> 10486.399
yeah we definitely do need a container x

10483.279 --> 10488.0
v h k green we absolutely do need a

10486.399 --> 10491.439
container because

10488.0 --> 10495.76
within the confines of the container

10491.439 --> 10499.04
gas might never get that high why

10495.76 --> 10500.08
because there's a container there was no

10499.04 --> 10502.319000000001
container

10500.08 --> 10503.84
yeah it would expand in all directions

10502.319 --> 10507.6
right not getting that

10503.84 --> 10508.0
high or rather gradient formation all

10507.6 --> 10511.12
that

10508.0 --> 10514.96
yeah why that happens because

10511.12 --> 10516.479000000001
there are limits of the volume due to

10514.96 --> 10519.438999999998
the container walls

10516.479 --> 10521.278999999999
being everywhere if there weren't then

10519.439 --> 10523.52
the gas

10521.279 --> 10525.279
would definitely get that high because

10523.52 --> 10527.68
it would be pushed

10525.279 --> 10529.359
from all sides from all other gases to

10527.68 --> 10531.52
go in all directions because there's

10529.359 --> 10532.720000000001
more volume available for it that's what

10531.52 --> 10536.0
it does primarily

10532.72 --> 10537.92
it's only when gases are contained

10536.0 --> 10541.12
within a limited volume

10537.92 --> 10543.76
that it might arrange itself slightly

10541.12 --> 10546.640000000001
differently based on the conditions

10543.76 --> 10547.359
and then yeah there would be less gas

10546.64 --> 10550.56
gathered

10547.359 --> 10552.880000000001
above because of the gradient

10550.56 --> 10553.6
but then gradient and that less gas

10552.88 --> 10557.039999999999
above

10553.6 --> 10559.92
only is there because it's contained

10557.04 --> 10562.080000000002
because the gradient was able to form

10559.92 --> 10564.64
due to the limitations of the volume

10562.08 --> 10564.64
available

10566.24 --> 10571.039999999999
right if there was more volume available

10568.96 --> 10571.759999999998
it would immediately expand in all

10571.04 --> 10576.720000000001
directions

10571.76 --> 10576.72
immediately explosively

10582.88 --> 10586.479
if we were close enough to the sun and

10584.8 --> 10588.319
we walked right into it would we get

10586.479 --> 10589.92
burned you can't get closer to the sun

10588.319 --> 10591.76
it's a hologram it's always going to

10589.92 --> 10594.08
stay at the edge of your vision

10591.76 --> 10594.880000000001
you can't actually reach the edge of

10594.08 --> 10598.56
your vision

10594.88 --> 10598.56
i hope you realize that rufus

10599.359 --> 10605.92
but hey if you want to prove me wrong

10602.64 --> 10609.119999999999
i've i've put out the the challenge

10605.92 --> 10612.16
can you get into the sun

10609.12 --> 10612.84
get a balloon get it exactly into the

10612.16 --> 10615.279
sun

10612.84 --> 10617.12
like approach it i want to see that

10615.279 --> 10619.439
balloon just shifting there as the sun

10617.12 --> 10619.439
comes

10622.319 --> 10627.359
right that's what i want to see the sun

10625.68 --> 10629.76
wait i'm not getting right in front of

10627.359 --> 10631.2
the camera like the sun

10629.76 --> 10633.92
you have the balloon here you have a

10631.2 --> 10635.52
camera you're looking around at the flat

10633.92 --> 10640.56
earth below and then the sun

10635.52 --> 10640.560000000001
comes like that

10640.64 --> 10644.16
like that until it's like so blinding

10643.279 --> 10646.800000000001
and it burns

10644.16 --> 10648.319
and then the balloon drops right i want

10646.8 --> 10651.358999999999
to see that

10648.319 --> 10653.439
before i can even imagine

10651.359 --> 10655.12
that the sun might be anything other

10653.439 --> 10657.2
than a hologram at the edge of our

10655.12 --> 10660.399000000001
vision the point is that i

10657.2 --> 10662.319000000001
haven't seen this ever or even

10660.399 --> 10664.08
heard there was anything you know what

10662.319 --> 10667.119999999999
the only tale

10664.08 --> 10670.08
the only tale fairy tale or myth

10667.12 --> 10671.76
that i've ever heard of anything getting

10670.08 --> 10673.439
close to the sun

10671.76 --> 10675.84
it's a little about a little cereben

10673.439 --> 10678.960000000001
it's about a little angel

10675.84 --> 10679.359
that flow flew too close to the sun and

10678.96 --> 10681.919999999998
its

10679.359 --> 10683.279
wings melted right that's the only

10681.92 --> 10685.92
freaking mythology

10683.279 --> 10686.560000000001
that even suggests that there is some

10685.92 --> 10688.960000000001
kind of a

10686.56 --> 10691.039999999999
thing that you can get close to and then

10688.96 --> 10694.24
proximity heat happens right

10691.04 --> 10697.359
that's the only story ever

10694.24 --> 10700.88
the only one that even

10697.359 --> 10705.84
that that's possible i've never seen an

10700.88 --> 10708.88
actual example of this tested ever

10705.84 --> 10711.439
nothing has ever burned up ever from

10708.88 --> 10714.8
getting too close to the sun ever

10711.439 --> 10715.279
not ever not a single time ever never

10714.8 --> 10717.92
ever

10715.279 --> 10720.16
ever has anything gotten close to the

10717.92 --> 10723.6
sun in order to get burned

10720.16 --> 10724.479
because of proximity heat ever but hey

10723.6 --> 10727.6
if you could

10724.479 --> 10730.8
demonstrate something

10727.6 --> 10733.279
that proves the contrast to that i'd

10730.8 --> 10740.399
love to see and hear and read all about

10733.279 --> 10742.0
it that would be fascinating right i

10740.399 --> 10744.24
think i'm gonna round out the show now

10742.0 --> 10744.24
though

10744.8 --> 10747.039999999999
right

10748.88 --> 10754.16
it's been going for since

10752.16 --> 10757.2
one right so i've been going for three

10754.16 --> 10757.2
hours that's awesome

10758.0 --> 10764.64
oh where did all the watches go i had

10759.84 --> 10769.439
like 120 earlier now that's just 35.

10764.64 --> 10772.08
too bad anyway

10769.439 --> 10773.84
i am rounding out so thanks everyone for

10772.08 --> 10777.12
coming i hope you liked the show

10773.84 --> 10777.76
i thought this show was a a blast it was

10777.12 --> 10780.399000000001
really good

10777.76 --> 10782.319
i was fluent i had a i was able to put

10780.399 --> 10785.199999999999
down a lot of good points

10782.319 --> 10788.96
very clearly at great chat participation

10785.2 --> 10788.960000000001
great questions good challenges

10789.12 --> 10793.279
yeah this was probably one of my best

10791.439 --> 10797.6
shows

10793.279 --> 10798.24
in this period so if you also like this

10797.6 --> 10800.24

great thank you very much for the

10825.12 --> 10829.279
contribution

10826.16 --> 10832.24
i can get some fish oil

10829.279 --> 10833.84
because of that and yeah i do need that

10832.24 --> 10835.84
stuff so

10833.84 --> 10836.960000000001
i mean i can't live without for a while

10835.84 --> 10840.72
but it

10836.96 --> 10843.438999999998
it drains on me so

10840.72 --> 10847.76
i will be back tomorrow with flat earth

10843.439 --> 10850.64
early bird number 863 on a wednesday

10847.76 --> 10852.479
same time one one o'clock and yeah

10850.64 --> 10853.599999999999
there's no flat earth debates live today

10852.479 --> 10857.278999999999
so

10853.6 --> 10860.399000000001
we'll just have to see each other in

10857.279 --> 10863.92
other chats hashtag

10860.399 --> 10865.519999999999
mifa indeed tom parker and until the

10863.92 --> 10881.84
next video

10865.52 --> 10881.84
keep it flat

10882.99 --> 10900.128999999999
[Music]

10949.76 --> 10951.84
you
