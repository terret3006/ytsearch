number 444 I'm your host

66.87 --> 71.01
Arwen and before we start to show please

79.86 --> 84.45
please also do support me and my channel

82.44 --> 86.009
throw the paypal patreon my GoFundMe in

84.45 --> 86.729
the super chat that will be much

86.009 --> 93.74
appreciated

86.729 --> 96.09
oh so I don't know if you can hear that

93.74 --> 98.869
yeah I'm pretty sure the microphone can

96.09 --> 101.009
pick some of that up it's there's a

98.869 --> 105.57
storm going on out there

101.009 --> 108.6
big time well I haven't really seen any

105.57 --> 111.55999999999999
trees go over yet but some serious wind

108.6 --> 111.55999999999999
gusts out there

116.32 --> 123.61
it's it's kind of tough to take a smoke

119.08 --> 125.86
outside in this weather and yeah this

123.61 --> 129.58
also this type of weather typically gets

125.86 --> 132.21
me kind of restless so predicting to

129.58 --> 134.98000000000002
have a quite a productive day today

132.21 --> 136.6
because it usually get very active and

134.98 --> 142.67999999999998
the hey there is some stuff that I have

136.6 --> 147.69
been needing to do for a DND for example

142.68 --> 147.69
but I'm also brewing up some other ideas

148.23 --> 153.32999999999998
getting some interesting ideas forwarded

151.0 --> 157.15
by my dad

153.33 --> 160.3
but the concept of information broking

157.15 --> 163.18
progress like that concept does

160.3 --> 166.39000000000001
information as a commodity it's

163.18 --> 169.66
fascinating and yeah I totally fall down

166.39 --> 173.7
there lain like just absolutely that's

169.66 --> 178.03
my thing so I don't know they're there

173.7 --> 180.66
what they basically suggest is like give

178.03 --> 183.66
courses for your information to

180.66 --> 186.489
basically other educate others about it

183.66 --> 191.1
and of course I'm just giving it out for

186.489 --> 194.47
free here whatever comes to mind but

191.1 --> 197.549
yeah I think I could probably do that

194.47 --> 200.26
like specialized advice for payment and

197.549 --> 202.15
potentially an hour or much more

200.26 --> 204.19
depending on the new complex and

202.15 --> 208.78
complexity of the nature of the problem

204.19 --> 210.82
and all that and I guess I could make

208.78 --> 213.19
money from that it's funny because that

210.82 --> 215.35
type of idea has been on my mind for a

213.19 --> 220.78
long time but I just never thought I was

215.35 --> 223.239
really good enough to to uphold that

220.78 --> 227.62
level of confidence you require in order

223.239 --> 229.51
to kind of shine off the legend that you

227.62 --> 233.68
have to be in order to get paid for

229.51 --> 235.42
advice like that because if if you're

233.68 --> 238.63
not confident enough that people will

235.42 --> 241.23899999999998
just shut er away they will yeah it has

238.63 --> 244.9
to feel alright and it has to be good

241.239 --> 246.62
advice of course so I don't know it was

244.9 --> 250.59
an interesting idea

246.62 --> 252.96
see where it goes yeah one of these

250.59 --> 257.76
things that I thought I could definitely

252.96 --> 258.57
help people to personally identify

257.76 --> 263.34
doublespeak

258.57 --> 265.79
and understand it and why it is there

263.34 --> 269.25
and all that not a flat earth of course

265.79 --> 271.23
although yeah I didn't it's pretty nice

269.25 --> 273.03
people that want that they'll probably

271.23 --> 274.92
figure it out by themselves just by

273.03 --> 278.15999999999997
listening to the flatter scene and all

274.92 --> 281.16
that and see long-term flat earthers

278.16 --> 283.5
deal with it on the spot like I have

281.16 --> 288.41900000000004
like nathan has like randy has like all

283.5 --> 289.89
of us have you know but bears it's not

288.419 --> 291.59999999999997
the only place where there's double

289.89 --> 294.21
speak there double speak all over the

291.6 --> 297.15000000000003
place there's double speak in family

294.21 --> 300.69
culture now sometimes with some people

297.15 --> 302.88
there's it slips in it's on TV it's in

300.69 --> 305.69
politics it's rife in politics it's an

302.88 --> 310.02
entire political stream pretty much

305.69 --> 310.74
based entirely on doublespeak this so

310.02 --> 313.46999999999997
yeah

310.74 --> 315.6
learning how to deal with that well for

313.47 --> 317.52000000000004
some people that may come natural they

315.6 --> 318.96000000000004
have the instincts for others it's much

317.52 --> 321.21
more difficult their instincts aren't

318.96 --> 323.51
that strong with it then how do they

321.21 --> 325.83
deal with it you know do they stay timid

323.51 --> 328.38
scared off by a double speak of the

325.83 --> 330.0
world or maybe they do want to try stuff

328.38 --> 335.54
out but they need to learn how to deal

330.0 --> 339.229
with it well I could potentially offer

335.54 --> 341.94
services to learn how to deal with it

339.229 --> 344.64
paid of course so would be private

341.94 --> 348.02
lessons like that just good

344.64 --> 348.02
conversations I can do it

348.979 --> 358.83
lawyers well--that's lawyers is a bit

353.07 --> 362.25
too far you know I like even know I got

358.83 --> 366.71999999999997
a Riley I got Tony and I'm so glad that

362.25 --> 370.08
I that I can trust him to a degree that

366.72 --> 371.12
is sufficient for me to truly keep him

370.08 --> 374.07
as an anchor point there because

371.12 --> 376.83
judicially I'm just that's

374.07 --> 379.46999999999997
that's still a few steps too far for me

376.83 --> 382.32
that is so complex like a sub layer of

379.47 --> 386.28000000000003
understanding and approach and poof so

382.32 --> 388.68
much but who knows you know maybe 10

386.28 --> 390.59999999999997
years maybe quicker this is the

388.68 --> 394.44
Information Age things go quickly but

390.6 --> 404.24
for now now that that judicial things is

394.44 --> 406.62
a bit too complicated right so yeah I've

404.24 --> 409.83
took note of some interesting things

406.62 --> 411.63
that I popped into yesterday well of

409.83 --> 415.05
course I wasn't the ballbuster show I

411.63 --> 419.4
don't know if you noticed I was a little

415.05 --> 422.01
drunk at first I didn't realize again

419.4 --> 423.96
that it seems to typically happen on

422.01 --> 426.09
certain Saturdays that I just think like

423.96 --> 428.13
yeah party and then it's like oh wait

426.09 --> 430.71
there's a live ball busters oh but I

428.13 --> 437.90999999999997
always basically assume that John just

430.71 --> 440.21999999999997
does premieres right but yeah it was

437.91 --> 441.78000000000003
still it was still nice and eventually I

440.22 --> 446.76000000000005
got my voice under control and lay down

441.78 --> 449.05999999999995
some good points it was a great show

446.76 --> 449.06
again

451.94 --> 458.52
hmm and yeah another guy I rigidly

456.419 --> 460.5
bumped into through Owen Benjamin who

458.52 --> 464.03999999999996
mentioned him it's just some guy in the

460.5 --> 465.81
Internet is I think he is he's

464.04 --> 467.72900000000004
definitely aware of Flat Earth oh he's

465.81 --> 469.86
not like he's definitely is a globe

467.729 --> 473.58
skeptic but a guy called quantum of

469.86 --> 476.97
conscious and he does pre-recorded stuff

473.58 --> 479.03999999999996
where just talks and all over the place

476.97 --> 483.62
kind of like what I do but in a slightly

479.04 --> 487.35
different format and he seems to have

483.62 --> 490.7
dug into the tartarean concept and all

487.35 --> 493.5
these old photographs and pictures of

490.7 --> 495.87
amazing old structures and just thinking

493.5 --> 498.0
about how can that be how can those have

495.87 --> 501.75
been constructed were they always there

498.0 --> 503.97
and yeah some cases it is shown like how

501.75 --> 508.44
they were built like how can they could

503.97 --> 511.94000000000005
have built this stuff so quickly and it

508.44 --> 515.849
seems like history has been scrubbed of

511.94 --> 519.63
certain things like that that is

515.849 --> 521.01
possible and I I left a few comments in

519.63 --> 524.4
the video I'll link the video it's a

521.01 --> 526.64
good video really collected some good

524.4 --> 526.64
pictures

526.91 --> 535.8299999999999
take a look at it it's about 50 minutes

529.8 --> 537.81
long it's a good one well mud flood but

535.83 --> 540.0600000000001
he doesn't really go into the mud flood

537.81 --> 542.8499999999999
itself he's just focusing in this video

540.06 --> 544.709
mostly on the old buildings inexplicable

542.85 --> 551.1
buildings in the world the World's Fair

544.709 --> 555.5889999999999
and all that so what I think more and

551.1 --> 561.48
more that has basically happened is that

555.589 --> 565.11
this age like the late 19th early 19th

561.48 --> 567.36
century was basically the the peak head

565.11 --> 569.82
of the actual Renaissance and the

567.36 --> 572.4590000000001
Renaissance was also technological it

569.82 --> 575.61
was the rediscovery of a lot of

572.459 --> 577.26
Atlantean stuff and it's this has kind

575.61 --> 580.38
of been scrubbed out so they've

577.26 --> 581.02
perfected stone casting all kinds of

580.38 --> 583.779
really

581.02 --> 586.3
techniques and refined the chemistry of

583.779 --> 588.97
it in order to it for it for basic

586.3 --> 593.8599999999999
costing stuff to last extremely long and

588.97 --> 596.47
this is kind of not public anymore this

593.86 --> 598.36
knowledge has been scrubbed out in kept

596.47 --> 601.87
in secret and I think that probably the

598.36 --> 607.42
Freemasons are kind of sort of guardians

601.87 --> 611.23
of it you know Mason's building you know

607.42 --> 614.1999999999999
I have no direct proof but that makes

611.23 --> 616.839
perfect sense to me that they would t be

614.2 --> 619.779
typical guardians of such knowledge and

616.839 --> 623.7900000000001
that maybe maybe it's been designated

619.779 --> 626.5889999999999
now that only the Select can basically

623.79 --> 628.12
use this knowledge you have to be part

626.589 --> 631.24
of a club or something and then you can

628.12 --> 636.36
apply it and and show off with secrets

631.24 --> 638.62
and that that is how it might be

636.36 --> 640.63
surfacing right now because I think that

638.62 --> 643.9590000000001
probably some of these techniques are

640.63 --> 646.779
still a new ways being utilized just not

643.959 --> 651.9399999999999
so fantastical so it's not so blatantly

646.779 --> 653.89
obvious so I think that's really kind of

651.94 --> 655.99
what's going on with this and that just

653.89 --> 660.36
building techniques are so much better

655.99 --> 662.77
than has been taught to us that it is I

660.36 --> 665.94
think that is probably one of the core

662.77 --> 670.0
things that we can all learn from this

665.94 --> 672.7900000000001
alternative history issue concerning the

670.0 --> 676.529
ancient architecture or the amazing

672.79 --> 676.529
level of the architecture

678.22 --> 685.9100000000001
all right and that doesn't mean by the

682.67 --> 690.3499999999999
way that every mason has access to how

685.91 --> 693.65
to do this stuff but you might require a

690.35 --> 695.78
certain level of insider connection to

693.65 --> 698.75
gain attained that and then there's

695.78 --> 700.85
going to be rules surrounding it those

698.75 --> 704.77
rules are probably taken very serious if

700.85 --> 704.77
you're amazing I can imagine

711.28 --> 715.91
anyway I thought that was not worthy

713.66 --> 720.05
that quantum of conscious delved into

715.91 --> 721.88
that you know he has ups and downs in my

720.05 --> 723.76
personal opinion but that seems to be

721.88 --> 728.89
with just mostly his personal

723.76 --> 728.89
philosophical dealings and development

731.089 --> 736.5790000000001
but yeah I like his train of thought at

734.359 --> 739.399
times and this was a good video so check

736.579 --> 741.799
it out if you haven't uh that was that

739.399 --> 747.229
oh yeah another weird little story from

741.799 --> 748.699
the main SAP mainstream media from the

747.229 --> 750.609
alternative media in which now

748.699 --> 753.679
apparently it is claimed at least

750.609 --> 755.599
because it's attributed to scientists

753.679 --> 757.3389999999999
and I think the original source was Fox

755.599 --> 759.349
News but it's odd it's an oddity

757.339 --> 761.089
nevertheless it's claimed that they're

759.349 --> 763.6990000000001
supposed to be in Chernobyl

761.089 --> 766.729
they found certain type of fungus that

763.699 --> 770.319
supposedly eats radiation

766.729 --> 774.019
according to them apparently it thrives

770.319 --> 776.539
in the vicinity where they claim is

774.019 --> 778.609
radiation now this makes me think like

776.539 --> 782.199
oh really it eats radiation does that

778.609 --> 787.6990000000001
how organisms work really you know that

782.199 --> 790.7589999999999
if something could be I would say immune

787.699 --> 792.3789999999999
to it to any effects that it may have I

790.759 --> 796.249
could go with that potentially like

792.379 --> 800.779
cockroaches are known to be pretty much

796.249 --> 806.719
immune but fungi it's totally this is

800.779 --> 812.299
more more kind of a plant like organism

806.719 --> 814.1890000000001
so that that seems illogical to me going

812.299 --> 817.279
with the baseline of what radiations

814.189 --> 819.2289999999999
supposed to be now on the other hand

817.279 --> 824.779
there may simply be a type of fungus

819.229 --> 828.3190000000001
there that just I guess thrives on the

824.779 --> 828.829
on the actual substance that that it all

828.319 --> 831.259
is

828.829 --> 834.559
yeah the radiation so maybe it's some

831.259 --> 838.819
kind of heat and it can it can tap into

834.559 --> 842.659
that so they keep on perpetuating this

838.819 --> 844.699
story about just radiation and how

842.659 --> 847.309
things are supposed to be reacting to it

844.699 --> 849.679
but it just seems more like things are

847.309 --> 852.819
actually not reacting to the radiation

849.679 --> 855.649
or not in the way that they claim

852.819 --> 858.5889999999999
radiation works and then they just spin

855.649 --> 860.8
out stories that kind of fill in the

858.589 --> 865.36
blanks

860.8 --> 869.1099999999999
two together suppose it switcheroo

865.36 --> 871.089
reason as to why the radiations still

869.11 --> 873.339
there but it's not having the fact that

871.089 --> 876.1890000000001
they originally claimed it sounds very

873.339 --> 883.269
baller ish doesn't it so that's what I

876.189 --> 886.439
see in that link the original article

883.269 --> 888.79
from Fox News I normally don't do that

886.439 --> 891.759
I'm not saying that Fox News is a

888.79 --> 895.509
reliable news source necessarily but to

891.759 --> 898.48
just this article is self speaking there

895.509 --> 901.259
is a lot of esoteric value within it

898.48 --> 904.54
that they cannot politicize away and

901.259 --> 907.799
they probably don't even understand so

904.54 --> 907.799
just take a look at that

910.77 --> 914.0799999999999
[Music]

915.04 --> 920.06
you know sometimes people that just

917.72 --> 921.8000000000001
write articles based on bullet points

920.06 --> 925.42
that they get forwarded they don't

921.8 --> 930.2199999999999
really know the bigger picture that much

925.42 --> 933.2299999999999
they're probably professionally aimed at

930.22 --> 936.6700000000001
writing the article perfectly because

933.23 --> 940.58
there's probably a lot of competition so

936.67 --> 942.4399999999999
yeah so things like this may be put

940.58 --> 945.32
forward as just a point of interest

942.44 --> 948.1400000000001
without realizing the greater

945.32 --> 948.9200000000001
consequences and I find that very

948.14 --> 956.87
interesting

948.92 --> 956.87
[Music]

967.91 --> 973.17
the bigger picture euler klein is that

970.829 --> 975.42
there is grave doubts concerning the

973.17 --> 978.5999999999999
nature of radiation in a radioactive

975.42 --> 981.56
material what it actually does and what

978.6 --> 981.5600000000001
is possible with it

987.02 --> 997.31
and that the amount of detriment that it

992.63 --> 1001.66
poses to life in a direct chemical sense

997.31 --> 1003.55
as it were has been quite overblown that

1001.66 --> 1006.54
is the bigger point that's the bigger

1003.55 --> 1006.54
picture the other claim

1016.02 --> 1020.959
right anyway I should go through chat

1026.86 --> 1031.049
what does that means a good servant

1035.57 --> 1040.6299999999999
your walk my walk

1042.55 --> 1049.0
I don't know I I think that Jesus

1046.72 --> 1051.73
Christ's frequency and principles have

1049.0 --> 1056.5
been a very good and rewarding example

1051.73 --> 1061.41
and I can feel the connections from the

1056.5 --> 1067.99
spiritual realm I can feel that yeah I

1061.41 --> 1070.71
can feel creation responding to me if

1067.99 --> 1073.51
that is some kind of answer

1070.71 --> 1076.83
don't really knows know what else to say

1073.51 --> 1076.83
good servant

1086.51 --> 1093.89
and right so it went through the

1091.91 --> 1096.22
articles I should go through chat it's

1093.89 --> 1096.22
been ages

1096.37 --> 1103.25
all right so yielder klein was first

1100.48 --> 1107.02
Preston Parker that one guy ego playing

1103.25 --> 1111.76
the anchor James Mason

1107.02 --> 1116.11
Martin Ellen Nathan Oakley 90-80

1111.76 --> 1116.11
Fiona James Gideon's sick

1119.98 --> 1134.549
Ali be doublespeak belts character it's

1126.6 --> 1140.039
no not really read moot we do we do okay

1134.549 --> 1140.039
I'm a UK bait sixty our MC

1148.469 --> 1155.919
sorry if I've skipped you it's a long

1150.7 --> 1158.519
list today Stacy B yeah that's what

1155.919 --> 1165.46
happens when I start 20 minutes in

1158.519 --> 1167.729
seeking star water pointless soon Rob

1165.46 --> 1167.729
Kane

1171.81 --> 1185.48
yeah I got you all right

1175.62 --> 1185.4799999999998
blinding watching off right

1188.0 --> 1192.11
yeah you know what let's let's have a

1190.43 --> 1193.6000000000001
little fun with chat since there's so

1192.11 --> 1199.36
many people here

1193.6 --> 1204.1999999999998
okay so press 1 if you're a flat earther

1199.36 --> 1211.4299999999998
press 0 if you're a baller please just

1204.2 --> 1215.41
do it once just to see and yeah don't be

1211.43 --> 1215.41
afraid it's gonna judge you

1226.75 --> 1234.24
yeah okay - is undecided sure on the

1232.0 --> 1234.24
fence

1238.4 --> 1241.15
hmm

1245.44 --> 1252.63
right it seems that yeah just the one

1250.33 --> 1255.22
and oh maybe a little bit oversimplified

1252.63 --> 1257.0800000000002
because indeed I guess there are people

1255.22 --> 1261.52
on the fence and there are people that

1257.08 --> 1267.1899999999998
don't want to stick to a geometry and

1261.52 --> 1270.93
just deny the globe I guess right anyway

1267.19 --> 1270.93
yeah good to see thanks for responding

1283.17 --> 1288.1000000000001
man I'm just seeing there's like these

1285.94 --> 1290.3500000000001
birds hovering up there you can see that

1288.1 --> 1294.6599999999999
they're like literally being slapped

1290.35 --> 1294.6599999999999
around sometimes by the wind gusts

1299.51 --> 1305.78
it's almost like they're surfing in this

1302.03 --> 1312.01
wind it really does seem like like

1305.78 --> 1314.1499999999999
surfers on waves just slide around and I

1312.01 --> 1317.24
think they're probably having a lot of

1314.15 --> 1320.5300000000002
fun they don't seem disturbed by it or

1317.24 --> 1320.53
anything anyway

1325.16 --> 1333.1100000000001
yeah I read that the other client that's

1330.81 --> 1333.11
fine

1336.47 --> 1342.089
[Music]

1347.73 --> 1351.67
[Music]

1348.96 --> 1353.56
yeah as long as you don't take that as a

1351.67 --> 1356.3500000000001
sign to start behaving like you did

1353.56 --> 1359.01
before you got banned and that's all

1356.35 --> 1359.01
fine with me

1368.06 --> 1372.49
Preston what why would I get rid of him

1373.03 --> 1378.73
he's just a globe or in denial come on

1375.8 --> 1378.73
he's pretty harmless

1385.19 --> 1393.3200000000002
now this is not a a Flat Earth only chat

1390.159 --> 1396.259
it's just that at times clubbers go too

1393.32 --> 1398.33
far and in the heat of the point they

1396.259 --> 1400.179
double down they show Double Down

1398.33 --> 1403.97
syndrome and that's a big problem

1400.179 --> 1408.44
because that is to me a personal offense

1403.97 --> 1412.07
is when I make a strong point that is

1408.44 --> 1416.1190000000001
not necessarily negative towards them

1412.07 --> 1417.979
you know I try to make my points that

1416.119 --> 1419.9889999999998
are strong as noble as I can and then

1417.979 --> 1423.559
when people Double Down syndrome on me

1419.989 --> 1425.21
it really pisses me off it makes it

1423.559 --> 1429.109
makes me feel like they're a bunch of

1425.21 --> 1432.2
demons and that part you got to learn to

1429.109 --> 1434.4499999999998
control yourself and then to shut up and

1432.2 --> 1438.499
if you can do that then you're always

1434.45 --> 1443.47
welcome here if you can't control

1438.499 --> 1443.47
yourself then you're not welcome

1445.44 --> 1451.74
but hey we get it you believe in the

1449.43 --> 1454.41
globe you want to stick to it and you

1451.74 --> 1457.91
don't like the arguments I get that but

1454.41 --> 1464.0
it doesn't mean that you should then

1457.91 --> 1464.0
assert your doublespeak right away

1468.23 --> 1474.68
there's like doors smacking all over the

1472.44 --> 1474.68
place

1478.82 --> 1486.11
I think I maybe should close this before

1483.83 --> 1497.77
it smacks in my back or something

1486.11 --> 1497.77
damn hello Adam get to see you

1504.139 --> 1510.9599999999998
yeah Black Swan indeed yep

1508.46 --> 1514.679
it's so funny you know the Black Swan

1510.96 --> 1516.8990000000001
because really the Black Swan and what

1514.679 --> 1519.0900000000001
we play with the memes it's all act

1516.899 --> 1520.7399999999998
exoteric s-- it's just playing around

1519.09 --> 1525.24
with something that we can play around

1520.74 --> 1527.429
with because the actual core meaning

1525.24 --> 1533.009
what makes it so important is purely

1527.429 --> 1536.94
esoteric it is rudimentary academics and

1533.009 --> 1540.69
that is the real strength of the Black

1536.94 --> 1544.009
Swan yeah it's all it's a bird it's

1540.69 --> 1546.419
black its aggressive its territorial and

1544.009 --> 1547.35
there aren't as many of them as there

1546.419 --> 1549.749
are white swans

1547.35 --> 1553.4989999999998
everybody knows white swans right but on

1549.749 --> 1559.59
the inside the Black Swan is just a very

1553.499 --> 1563.1290000000001
pure precise clear-cut argument that

1559.59 --> 1568.019
helps people give a foundational

1563.129 --> 1571.4399999999998
understanding when things can no longer

1568.019 --> 1574.049
be because of an exception that has

1571.44 --> 1577.19
become apparent and that is the true

1574.049 --> 1577.19
strength of the Black Swan

1581.52 --> 1587.649
and that's the difference between the

1583.899 --> 1590.07
exoteric side and esoteric side you

1587.649 --> 1590.07
understand

1593.23 --> 1599.26
value it would be valuable to if you

1596.38 --> 1604.029
really got this and the difference it

1599.26 --> 1609.24
helps you see things more if you manage

1604.029 --> 1609.24
to get the training

1611.24 --> 1613.659
yeah

1626.75 --> 1632.13
the

1628.17 --> 1638.8500000000001
go to a photo shop and that's just that

1632.13 --> 1641.5200000000002
arias Preston Parker that it that is

1638.85 --> 1644.4199999999998
amazing I wonder if you realize what you

1641.52 --> 1644.42
just put down there

1658.19 --> 1662.2
yeah what does it have him he can

1668.44 --> 1671.25
what is it

1680.85 --> 1683.389
what

1690.66 --> 1693.789
[Music]

1700.08 --> 1704.36
yeah

1701.99 --> 1708.23
yeah but Preston Park you do realize

1704.36 --> 1713.299
that it's still gonna be worked on right

1708.23 --> 1716.2
it's not as it so it's it's I knew you

1713.299 --> 1716.2
wouldn't really get it

1721.47 --> 1724.009
yeah

1728.03 --> 1733.94
[Music]

1729.58 --> 1737.71
as soon as you subject a photograph to

1733.94 --> 1741.3200000000002
Photoshop then it's no longer photograph

1737.71 --> 1745.75
it's shopped and now it has become a

1741.32 --> 1745.75
picture or an image

1750.73 --> 1755.73
doesn't really matter what you do if you

1752.83 --> 1761.08
alter something it's not really

1755.73 --> 1763.9
photograph anymore could be argued that

1761.08 --> 1768.28
altering for example color layers or a

1763.9 --> 1770.41
little contrast that yeah could be

1768.28 --> 1772.57
argued that it is basically still the

1770.41 --> 1776.46
photograph because nothing in content

1772.57 --> 1778.78
has been altered it's just a

1776.46 --> 1782.23
representation spectrum as where that's

1778.78 --> 1785.29
being slighted but yeah when you're

1782.23 --> 1787.3600000000001
definitely gonna displace things and

1785.29 --> 1793.5
everything yet then it's no longer the

1787.36 --> 1793.5
photograph Oh Preston Parker please

1805.93 --> 1810.469
[Music]

1811.33 --> 1813.6589999999999
I know

1818.22 --> 1822.339
[Music]

1835.27 --> 1838.3899999999999
[Music]

1841.47 --> 1848.309
yeah it's the classic rumpus projection

1845.19 --> 1850.47
response well a lot of ballers do would

1848.309 --> 1852.21
have been doing it forever I used to do

1850.47 --> 1854.22
that kind of thing if I was caught

1852.21 --> 1857.7
flat-footed when I was much younger I

1854.22 --> 1860.22
don't do that anymore but rompers does

1857.7 --> 1867.1390000000001
it the most eloquent eloquently and

1860.22 --> 1871.3790000000001
convinced self convinced but yeah it is

1867.139 --> 1873.779
a baseline fallback position you just

1871.379 --> 1876.019
don't understand I'm pretty sure that I

1873.779 --> 1876.019
did

1876.22 --> 1879.349
[Music]

1881.879 --> 1888.4189999999999
I sew straight right yeah Adam ikan

1886.559 --> 1891.21
that's interesting but it doesn't really

1888.419 --> 1897.1190000000001
work either because if you have every

1891.21 --> 1900.48
wide photographs right then there is a

1897.119 --> 1903.509
like a circle of psychic thing going

1900.48 --> 1905.6390000000001
kind of so there may be some all if

1903.509 --> 1906.269
you've got to squish it together really

1905.639 --> 1909.57
badly

1906.269 --> 1913.139
yeah then that effect will basically

1909.57 --> 1916.139
become apparent but the horizontal

1913.139 --> 1919.529
straight line is pretty much it becomes

1916.139 --> 1921.809
really relevant from a single fixed few

1919.529 --> 1927.239
points that is when it's always straight

1921.809 --> 1931.32
but if you like circle around then yeah

1927.239 --> 1934.3500000000001
it's a circle it's pretty much the line

1931.32 --> 1938.249
of sight it's technically a circle while

1934.35 --> 1941.039
depending on how regular the air clarity

1938.249 --> 1943.259
levels are it is pretty much a circle

1941.039 --> 1945.749
around you so I think that that

1943.259 --> 1948.1490000000001
compressing trick I've seen rumpus even

1945.749 --> 1951.749
do it before and other people Timmie

1948.149 --> 1953.639
and then they say oh this curvature but

1951.749 --> 1956.759
it has more to do really with just the

1953.639 --> 1960.059
line of sight because it's not really

1956.759 --> 1961.499
curvature and it's not look when you're

1960.059 --> 1964.59
going to assume that that is some kind

1961.499 --> 1966.179
of curvature York I don't know if you

1964.59 --> 1968.07
realize it but you kind of then

1966.179 --> 1969.749
automatically assume that you're looking

1968.07 --> 1971.009
at the leading edge of a sphere because

1969.749 --> 1975.69
that is where you're gonna look for the

1971.009 --> 1978.95
curvature right so doesn't really match

1975.69 --> 1978.95
up in the end it's

1980.7 --> 1987.72
it's a funny little trick but still

1984.659 --> 1990.1490000000001
doesn't work because in order for that

1987.72 --> 1991.98
for you to presume that that is

1990.149 --> 1993.389
curvature or proof of curvature then

1991.98 --> 1994.739
you're first going to have to assume

1993.389 --> 2000.7389999999998
that you're looking at the leading edge

1994.739 --> 2003.259
of a sphere and pretty sure that you

2000.739 --> 2005.57
never claimed that the horizon was the

2003.259 --> 2009.019
leading edge of a sphere right that's

2005.57 --> 2012.32
the new tagline now that's the new party

2009.019 --> 2014.779
line narrative okay well then you can't

2012.32 --> 2018.019
really show any photographs and claimed

2014.779 --> 2022.429
to see geometrical curvature or proof of

2018.019 --> 2025.489
curvature in them anymore either so yeah

2022.429 --> 2028.1290000000001
I know it takes some getting used to you

2025.489 --> 2032.239
know you you're basically losing a

2028.129 --> 2034.34
couple of story options to fool around

2032.239 --> 2037.549
with you're losing some of your toys and

2034.34 --> 2043.279
yeah you still don't realize it yet take

2037.549 --> 2045.32
some time to get used to well yeah did

2043.279 --> 2048.73
the whole curvature in photographs is

2045.32 --> 2048.73
pretty much out of the door right now

2056.339 --> 2060.49
it doesn't mean that of course you can

2058.899 --> 2062.5
always presuppose the earth to be a

2060.49 --> 2065.29
globe anyway still gonna do that

2062.5 --> 2067.77
especially concerning space and know the

2065.29 --> 2071.97
entire astronomy and astrophysics

2067.77 --> 2075.19
department and all that cosmology but

2071.97 --> 2078.339
yeah the actual earth-based

2075.19 --> 2080.7400000000002
proof that the earth is a globe the

2078.339 --> 2081.31
actual earth-based proof for earth being

2080.74 --> 2083.169
a globe

2081.31 --> 2085.349
things that we can test here the

2083.169 --> 2088.3289999999997
curvature right the start the foundation

2085.349 --> 2089.9500000000003
where we originally became convinced

2088.329 --> 2092.5600000000004
that hey the urban may be a globe

2089.95 --> 2094.2999999999997
because of things coming off the horizon

2092.56 --> 2099.099
that was portrayed as a geometrical

2094.3 --> 2104.4700000000003
curve well that that's gone and with

2099.099 --> 2106.3900000000003
that everything that is basically some

2104.47 --> 2110.02
kind of analysis of things in the

2106.39 --> 2112.089
distance you see because now when you

2110.02 --> 2114.79
claim that that is falsely proof of a

2112.089 --> 2117.79
curve you are then whether you realize

2114.79 --> 2120.04
it or not automatically assuming that

2117.79 --> 2122.41
you are looking at the curvature of

2120.04 --> 2125.77
Earth which is a geometrical curve that

2122.41 --> 2129.7599999999998
is wise it's a curve right according to

2125.77 --> 2132.7599999999998
you so when you do that you forgot oh

2129.76 --> 2135.7900000000004
wait doesn't really work anymore because

2132.76 --> 2139.0
we've already properly identified the

2135.79 --> 2147.52
horizon now as not being a geometrical

2139.0 --> 2150.01
curve yeah stuff it's the black swan

2147.52 --> 2152.74
but the Black Swan is very territorial

2150.01 --> 2157.1800000000003
he doesn't allow infringing upon his

2152.74 --> 2164.8799999999997
territory when he arrives slaps you very

2157.18 --> 2164.8799999999997
painfully pokes you with this beak

2166.35 --> 2170.04
you've seen the videos

2172.83 --> 2179.22
what is that video you linked you will

2176.59 --> 2179.2200000000003
play an anchor

2188.0 --> 2193.78
Oh

2189.92 --> 2193.78
alright I'm almost there

2197.67 --> 2204.559
so they're like a restream or just the

2201.269 --> 2204.5589999999997
after show I have no idea

2212.16 --> 2216.45
all right sorry to cause it you know

2214.32 --> 2218.55
yeah I said I would still stick to globe

2216.45 --> 2225.6499999999996
busters absolutely it's too way too

2218.55 --> 2225.65
valuable to step away from at this point

2240.02 --> 2243.13
[Music]

2256.17 --> 2258.7400000000002
it

2266.569 --> 2269.569
yeah

2277.49 --> 2292.33
ah right so yeah what else

2289.16 --> 2292.33
[Music]

2294.6 --> 2305.19
I've been watching a bit of Netflix some

2297.6 --> 2307.02
mixed interest some new sci-fi thing it

2305.19 --> 2310.68
was kind of interesting with some good

2307.02 --> 2314.5099999999998
visuals and it's Netflix you know it was

2310.68 --> 2322.5899999999997
a think of mini serie or something

2314.51 --> 2325.34
anyway I'll report back on it once I

2322.59 --> 2325.34
finish it

2332.579 --> 2338.429
yeah I didn't see any D live activity

2334.89 --> 2341.609
yesterday so my surprise although I

2338.429 --> 2344.4590000000003
think old Benjamin may have been live in

2341.609 --> 2348.42
him I missed out on him or just saw a

2344.459 --> 2353.1499999999996
small part and I remember I don't see

2348.42 --> 2353.15
lift avail doing anything recently

2365.94 --> 2368.66
hmm

2377.44 --> 2383.43
all right

2379.309 --> 2394.829
well okay I'll give a hint like yeah

2383.43 --> 2396.359
because I'll be into the sea yeah right

2394.829 --> 2400.5890000000004
oh yeah

2396.359 --> 2402.989
it's called another life it is a season

2400.589 --> 2407.43
so I'm still half well I'm still in

2402.989 --> 2411.63
episode 1 but I was impressed by the

2407.43 --> 2418.3799999999997
amount of interesting condensed

2411.63 --> 2420.119
information in the dialogue so I don't

2418.38 --> 2422.039
know what the how good this year is

2420.119 --> 2429.63
gonna turn out to be but the CGI was

2422.039 --> 2431.789
just baffling or

2429.63 --> 2434.009
well baffling it wasn't even like super

2431.789 --> 2436.6800000000003
flashy baffling it was just like really

2434.009 --> 2439.799
beautiful what they made obviously CGI

2436.68 --> 2443.3089999999997
was just like oh don't I don't know I

2439.799 --> 2445.38
liked it it was very science fiction

2443.309 --> 2447.4500000000003
that really kind of utilizes the

2445.38 --> 2450.089
technology well and they paid a lot of

2447.45 --> 2454.259
attention I think and I kind of liked

2450.089 --> 2459.5389999999998
the characters so far so yeah it's

2454.259 --> 2462.059
another series I don't know but yeah

2459.539 --> 2463.489
that's kind of interesting I think if

2462.059 --> 2468.21
you're interested in science fiction

2463.489 --> 2470.039
it's like an alien encounter thing in a

2468.21 --> 2475.4700000000003
way you know it kind of reminds me of

2470.039 --> 2477.599
that was it like a mini movie what was

2475.47 --> 2483.83
it called again or was it a Netflix

2477.599 --> 2487.46
special movie let me find it

2483.83 --> 2489.62
it reminded me a lot about it it was

2487.46 --> 2492.89
about supposedly some kind of weird

2489.62 --> 2498.65
alien and evolution and pretty much a

2492.89 --> 2502.0699999999997
team of women that went in I think but

2498.65 --> 2503.81
that that movie reminded me quality wise

2502.07 --> 2506.1200000000003
a lot about what I'm seeing in this

2503.81 --> 2508.88
series although that movie wasn't

2506.12 --> 2514.19
directed at outer space this obviously

2508.88 --> 2516.7000000000003
is let me double check the name if I can

2514.19 --> 2516.7000000000003
find it

2522.79 --> 2526.56
was it annihilation

2532.8 --> 2539.1000000000004
could be let me double check that I'm

2535.53 --> 2541.4300000000003
IND be sorry for ya wasting everyone's

2539.1 --> 2544.61
time here just

2541.43 --> 2544.6099999999997
[Music]

2547.19 --> 2555.31
mmm wait no wait no what Oh

2563.18 --> 2568.3399999999997
but it might have been in yeah yeah yeah

2567.68 --> 2571.22
it's the one

2568.34 --> 2574.1000000000004
yeah anihilation that's right from 2018

2571.22 --> 2578.93
this female crowd I thought it was kind

2574.1 --> 2581.81
of good but yeah this series kind of

2578.93 --> 2584.27
reminds me on the creative level about

2581.81 --> 2586.88
it so yeah I don't know if you're

2584.27 --> 2590.02
interested in watching a like some

2586.88 --> 2595.03
proper science fiction something new

2590.02 --> 2599.45
then yeah check it out on Netflix

2595.03 --> 2602.9300000000003
another life you know series anyway yep

2599.45 --> 2605.87
sorry I don't know I if something is

2602.93 --> 2609.2599999999998
good even if January the platform kind

2605.87 --> 2612.0499999999997
of sucks then I still yeah I will point

2609.26 --> 2613.88
it out you know give good things an

2612.05 --> 2618.8500000000004
opportunity always cultivate the good

2613.88 --> 2618.85
things wherever you are pretty much so

2621.82 --> 2625.73
alright

2623.09 --> 2628.6000000000004
oh and in another hand I had kind of

2625.73 --> 2632.66
dipped into a little also a Spanish

2628.6 --> 2637.97
spoken series about witches but I

2632.66 --> 2640.91
thought it was pretty interesting it is

2637.97 --> 2642.68
kind of like a medieval where the

2640.91 --> 2645.1299999999997
witches have more power I don't know I

2642.68 --> 2648.8599999999997
guess it's a widely explored theme but

2645.13 --> 2650.81
it is very Spanish cultured like there

2648.86 --> 2653.57
is a difference you know I can you can

2650.81 --> 2657.71
feel it Spanish have their own approach

2653.57 --> 2660.23
to this it's fascinating and yeah I

2657.71 --> 2663.29
watch it Spanish spoken with English

2660.23 --> 2665.6
subtitles because I don't know I like

2663.29 --> 2667.61
the Spanish language and it's so well

2665.6 --> 2671.0899999999997
spoken in the area they do they do their

2667.61 --> 2674.03
best to speak it properly and you can

2671.09 --> 2676.7000000000003
hear that I like the sound of it so yeah

2674.03 --> 2679.67
that's series called Luna naira

2676.7 --> 2683.8999999999996
and that's not science fiction it is

2679.67 --> 2687.4900000000002
more witchcraft II medieval bit

2683.9 --> 2690.109
fantasies I like it

2687.49 --> 2693.7
so yeah that does or some series I'm

2690.109 --> 2693.7
kind of like looking into now

2698.17 --> 2702.609
alright so that's enough for Netflix

2704.09 --> 2710.92
[Music]

2707.23 --> 2710.92
what else what else

2711.65 --> 2715.179
[Music]

2727.26 --> 2730.4590000000003
[Music]

2731.43 --> 2737.5099999999998
well what else you know look there's

2734.7 --> 2741.3289999999997
things I generally try to keep out of my

2737.51 --> 2743.6400000000003
show that is mainly politics and things

2741.329 --> 2745.349
that involve politics because once you

2743.64 --> 2746.5099999999998
start draggy and that everything becomes

2745.349 --> 2748.71
about it

2746.51 --> 2756.0890000000004
because there well there is a lot of

2748.71 --> 2758.9700000000003
things happening so I do like check out

2756.089 --> 2762.869
our Tea for example every now and then

2758.97 --> 2765.6899999999996
and enforce still too even though it is

2762.869 --> 2769.2000000000003
a lot of very very varied politics it

2765.69 --> 2776.549
gets kind of annoying but I do keep

2769.2 --> 2782.0389999999998
track but it seems like this whole what

2776.549 --> 2784.2
is it this this mark legal situation

2782.039 --> 2789.059
concerning Trump is kind of finally over

2784.2 --> 2791.64
and yeah and it's almost like the

2789.059 --> 2794.15
ballers now the Democrats are basically

2791.64 --> 2798.3489999999997
just double speaking and trying to just

2794.15 --> 2802.099
they're spiraling very blatantly so now

2798.349 --> 2802.099
it's getting kind of weird

2805.61 --> 2809.7200000000003
but yeah that's just America mostly and

2808.28 --> 2817.61
then there's the rest of the world and

2809.72 --> 2822.08
my god so many things happen let's not

2817.61 --> 2825.4300000000003
drag that into here all right now maybe

2822.08 --> 2825.43
when it becomes really relevant

2833.839 --> 2836.41
huh

2840.25 --> 2844.71
and that's an awesome story James Mason

2851.37 --> 2856.49
yeah that's that's a history of things

2867.68 --> 2874.25
ya jerk Sanford and I told you I've been

2872.36 --> 2876.5
telling you from the start I've been

2874.25 --> 2879.11
telling talking even in flatter talks

2876.5 --> 2882.62
about the shit's like no it's just gonna

2879.11 --> 2885.65
win and it's sometimes gonna get kind of

2882.62 --> 2887.9
ugly and the grassroots may get

2885.65 --> 2892.13
resentful at times and it's it's

2887.9 --> 2895.34
confusing it is kind of like changing

2892.13 --> 2900.53
how everything and it jetta CLE works

2895.34 --> 2903.9500000000003
it's confusing what Trump does all the

2900.53 --> 2906.77
Papa Joe well yeah pump maybe Trump may

2903.95 --> 2909.98
be part of the puppet show but his

2906.77 --> 2915.16
puppetry has an influence on the whole

2909.98 --> 2915.16
thing so you know

2919.69 --> 2929.98
and besides Papa just can make quite an

2922.15 --> 2934.03
impression on little children so mayor

2929.98 --> 2940.089
Pelosi is certifiable yes himself yes

2934.03 --> 2942.849
she's in a bad spot right now it's so

2940.089 --> 2947.17
crazy all the things that she's done and

2942.849 --> 2949.119
the attitudes and and she does really

2947.17 --> 2955.869
look like a complete nutcase at this

2949.119 --> 2960.4500000000003
point is she so politicized she's just

2955.869 --> 2960.4500000000003
out of she's become out of this world

2963.119 --> 2971.23
kids should never watch politics well

2965.799 --> 2973.5389999999998
yeah I kind of agreed but they probably

2971.23 --> 2978.4
don't want to you know I hated politics

2973.539 --> 2981.099
when I was a up until my teens like I

2978.4 --> 2983.319
didn't like politics at all until I was

2981.099 --> 2987.52
pretty much 21 and then when 9/11

2983.319 --> 2989.349
happened then suddenly suddenly it did

2987.52 --> 2992.77
kind of catch my interest because there

2989.349 --> 2995.23
was some weird [ __ ] going down but

2992.77 --> 2998.799
before that I absolutely did not care

2995.23 --> 3003.359
even when I heard in my dark world

2998.799 --> 3005.849
vision in 97 I presume it was my dark

3003.359 --> 3008.22
world vision or or if it was in the real

3005.849 --> 3011.7000000000003
world that's some freaky [ __ ] well where

3008.22 --> 3014.97
I was basically shown like oh yeah yeah

3011.7 --> 3020.27
the businessman Trump and Clinton's wife

3014.97 --> 3023.069
are the big company competing thing now

3020.27 --> 3025.77
in 97

3023.069 --> 3030.27
specifically and I mentioned this before

3025.77 --> 3033.27
that as thing as time has moved on I

3030.27 --> 3036.9
remembered that and suddenly realized

3033.27 --> 3039.18
the significance of that even though at

3036.9 --> 3042.7200000000003
the time I literally had no interest in

3039.18 --> 3046.3489999999997
politics when I experienced that so yeah

3042.72 --> 3049.22
that's weird and fascinating to that I

3046.349 --> 3049.2200000000003
still remember it

3062.92 --> 3067.2690000000002
it was kind of funny because when

3065.41 --> 3069.73
President Trump was still running you

3067.269 --> 3074.049
know in the in the the first wave when

3069.73 --> 3078.9900000000002
when the energy was really good it's

3074.049 --> 3082.45
really really good then at that time I

3078.99 --> 3084.22
knew just like ya know I'm absolutely

3082.45 --> 3088.779
certain he's gonna win you can already

3084.22 --> 3092.589
see the signs that it's just not gonna

3088.779 --> 3094.269
switch like even if the Democrats would

3092.589 --> 3096.43
have cheated and they probably already

3094.269 --> 3101.529
even did that at a time it just didn't

3096.43 --> 3104.0789999999997
work wasn't enough the Trump wave worked

3101.529 --> 3111.64
way too well he had too many good points

3104.079 --> 3115.75
and yeah and I knew that he was that

3111.64 --> 3121.15
that's gonna be the thing and it yeah

3115.75 --> 3123.4
Clinton was gonna have to take take a

3121.15 --> 3125.64
back seat and she doesn't like that at

3123.4 --> 3125.64
all

3134.339 --> 3140.009
as has been late in the office like she

3136.949 --> 3147.349
even wrote books about that [ __ ] so it's

3140.009 --> 3147.349
just yeah anyway

3167.31 --> 3173.19
right well you know that one guy there's

3170.37 --> 3175.5
this thing you know because Trump is

3173.19 --> 3179.12
tied in to so many things because he's a

3175.5 --> 3183.06
business guy there's still a lot of risk

3179.12 --> 3186.7799999999997
because what is he actually gonna do

3183.06 --> 3188.61
once once he wins and pretty sure he

3186.78 --> 3190.53
will you know

3188.61 --> 3192.84
especially at this point like some

3190.53 --> 3197.34
really freaky [ __ ] I would have to go

3192.84 --> 3199.92
down to even try to stop that from

3197.34 --> 3204.51
happening at this point but I don't

3199.92 --> 3207.6
think even that would work but what is

3204.51 --> 3211.0200000000004
he gonna do afterward is certainly some

3207.6 --> 3212.22
war gonna is it gonna be the starting

3211.02 --> 3214.65
signal for the military-industrial

3212.22 --> 3216.6299999999997
complex which he does seem to have

3214.65 --> 3219.81
connections with whatever he likes to

3216.63 --> 3223.59
tell everyone are the are they gonna

3219.81 --> 3225.2999999999997
just suddenly start the things are going

3223.59 --> 3228.51
to happen and then suddenly it's gonna

3225.3 --> 3230.07
be some yeah well maybe not a even a

3228.51 --> 3234.9300000000003
congressional war maybe it's just gonna

3230.07 --> 3237.9
do just more executive strikes and [ __ ]

3234.93 --> 3243.0299999999997
and then yeah kind of what we've seen

3237.9 --> 3244.71
the last two decades and it's gonna make

3243.03 --> 3247.17
things better again you know that's the

3244.71 --> 3250.5
thing it's like it's not a perfect

3247.17 --> 3253.53
win-win really Trump I think it's like

3250.5 --> 3256.08
yeah things will be relatively good but

3253.53 --> 3259.44
still the [ __ ] that the dark ones do is

3256.08 --> 3262.56
still gonna unfold basically apparently

3259.44 --> 3267.33
hasn't been able to maneuver around that

3262.56 --> 3272.64
in his planning probably just the

3267.33 --> 3278.16
industry it brings and the money flow

3272.64 --> 3281.1
it's it's yeah he he can't figure out a

3278.16 --> 3283.5299999999997
way to basically scratch it out of the

3281.1 --> 3287.31
plan that's what I think is what really

3283.53 --> 3289.67
happened but we'll see we'll see what

3287.31 --> 3289.67
happens

3293.58 --> 3297.84
that is secretly taking down the evil

3295.77 --> 3300.75
empire well it does certainly seems to

3297.84 --> 3303.27
be taking down a certain section of the

3300.75 --> 3306.96
old guard and he's been absolutely

3303.27 --> 3310.44
blatantly trying to kind of pull some of

3306.96 --> 3313.41
them to his side and didn't overall work

3310.44 --> 3315.42
out that great but he's been trying and

3313.41 --> 3318.39
is almost like visible that he was

3315.42 --> 3321.0
trying that didn't really work out all

3318.39 --> 3324.0299999999997
that well but he's definitely trying to

3321.0 --> 3327.84
take care of the more self-destructive

3324.03 --> 3331.76
parts that really don't like America the

3327.84 --> 3334.8900000000003
the the to fanatical globalist as well

3331.76 --> 3337.17
because I think the Trump also wants the

3334.89 --> 3340.5899999999997
kind of Americanized globalism and once

3337.17 --> 3343.6800000000003
the change that the out the angle to

3340.59 --> 3347.1000000000004
globalism to become more American

3343.68 --> 3350.24
centric because hey that would yeah that

3347.1 --> 3354.5099999999998
would absolutely bring a Golden Age and

3350.24 --> 3357.54
imaginable potentially to America but

3354.51 --> 3360.5600000000004
yeah that's how are these how is that

3357.54 --> 3362.88
gonna be done at this point it through

3360.56 --> 3366.84
manipulations and fooling around and

3362.88 --> 3369.9300000000003
poking and sudden sudden changes in

3366.84 --> 3372.63
government here and there it's pretty

3369.93 --> 3374.25
much gonna be scheming sorry

3372.63 --> 3377.25
make it sound so ugly but it's pretty

3374.25 --> 3379.26
much what it comes down to and that's

3377.25 --> 3381.72
the only way you can kind of manipulate

3379.26 --> 3384.3900000000003
the market and the world politic

3381.72 --> 3388.7999999999997
political scene into that and it's is

3384.39 --> 3393.0
well he's doing pretty okay you know

3388.8 --> 3395.7000000000003
with what what's available I'd say but

3393.0 --> 3398.76
yeah the warlords indeed they're still

3395.7 --> 3403.8799999999997
kind of there they're still involved

3398.76 --> 3407.4300000000003
it's not yeah he's not going for them

3403.88 --> 3412.6800000000003
obviously not in direct sense although

3407.43 --> 3415.41
he I think that Trump probably envisions

3412.68 --> 3416.64
kind of a the military-industrial

3415.41 --> 3420.12
complex

3416.64 --> 3422.58
as a potential powerful defensive armor

3420.12 --> 3425.5499999999997
that it would not be used I think he

3422.58 --> 3428.22
wants that but practically

3425.55 --> 3429.9300000000003
that doesn't fully work because the

3428.22 --> 3432.24
industry is an industry it has to keep

3429.93 --> 3434.8199999999997
on rolling acts have to be done in order

3432.24 --> 3440.4599999999996
for it to survive so it's like a

3434.82 --> 3444.9
vampiric Armour a little and Trump is

3440.46 --> 3446.73
kind of like okay well I'll just have to

3444.9 --> 3449.4300000000003
go with that and kind of find a middle

3446.73 --> 3452.34
road that's what it feels like that this

3449.43 --> 3455.46
is all divining so is just some guy in

3452.34 --> 3456.78
the Netherlands right who cares but

3455.46 --> 3459.69
that's what I think I don't know what

3456.78 --> 3462.57
Trump thinks maybe thinks I'm mind my

3459.69 --> 3464.34
own business you know I bet he has a lot

3462.57 --> 3466.4900000000002
of complex things that he's dealing with

3464.34 --> 3469.2000000000003
that he has to make decisions on that

3466.49 --> 3473.37
there's too little information for this

3469.2 --> 3475.5899999999997
but he still got a good intuition with

3473.37 --> 3482.64
certain types of decisions at least you

3475.59 --> 3486.69
know anyway that's my view on that I

3482.64 --> 3491.39
guess I got political after all sort of

3486.69 --> 3491.39
not really more geopolitical

3496.82 --> 3505.07
now but look politics is real

3499.91 --> 3507.2599999999998
look what is real is what they say and

3505.07 --> 3509.8700000000003
what you get to see on television is

3507.26 --> 3514.46
that real or is that kind of a stage

3509.87 --> 3518.5699999999997
play right that's very relevant thing to

3514.46 --> 3521.66
ask yourself but does that mean that the

3518.57 --> 3524.11
entire thing itself the party themselves

3521.66 --> 3527.6
and that the people themselves are

3524.11 --> 3531.4700000000003
performing a play together or are they

3527.6 --> 3535.88
just bound to certain deals to their own

3531.47 --> 3540.23
personal career and to the narrative

3535.88 --> 3542.06
that they will partially or mostly agree

3540.23 --> 3545.48
upon and then fight for that for

3542.06 --> 3547.52
personal reasons you know so yeah there

3545.48 --> 3550.25
may be some level of acting going on but

3547.52 --> 3553.49
it doesn't mean that it's all a complete

3550.25 --> 3556.01
cover acts and does not represent the

3553.49 --> 3558.68
reality in the slightest but there may

3556.01 --> 3560.36
be secret [ __ ] going down with certain

3558.68 --> 3565.7599999999998
people that are keeping these nefarious

3560.36 --> 3567.71
secrets and then showing another play to

3565.76 --> 3570.0200000000004
the rest of the politicians in the

3567.71 --> 3572.84
public that are not informed about it

3570.02 --> 3575.03
and they anticipate to that that may be

3572.84 --> 3577.79
going on but to automatically assume

3575.03 --> 3580.0600000000004
that the whole political system is that

3577.79 --> 3585.02
per default everywhere that's wrong

3580.06 --> 3588.73
that's just incorrect so it's a little

3585.02 --> 3588.73
bit more nuanced than that

3591.42 --> 3597.849
yeah well run if I see that that does

3594.549 --> 3599.559
seem to be an important Drive hey

3597.849 --> 3602.079
because rich people have a lot of money

3599.559 --> 3603.9990000000003
so if if you need a lot of money then

3602.079 --> 3607.15
you need rich people and yeah the way to

3603.999 --> 3608.979
get them is to buy make making them a

3607.15 --> 3611.319
little bit more rich and hopefully

3608.979 --> 3613.7189999999996
getting certain things done at the same

3611.319 --> 3618.549
time and that's how a lot of politicians

3613.719 --> 3621.2490000000003
function directly or indirectly

3618.549 --> 3624.7889999999998
depending on what the laws of a country

3621.249 --> 3628.029
even allow so anyway I'm gonna round out

3624.789 --> 3629.65
the show thanks everyone for coming I

3628.029 --> 3632.92
hope you like to show it was a bit all

3629.65 --> 3636.579
