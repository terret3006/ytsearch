140.879 --> 147.84
sudden gusts as much it really is kind

145.48 --> 150.79999999999998
of a constant

147.84 --> 153.04

164.72 --> 169.44
blue through the clouds here and there

but I mean that's not going to amount to

169.44 --> 174.44

241.68 --> 247.49
when that happens no I

244.68 --> 250.079
don't

247.49 --> 252.14000000000001
[Music]

250.079 --> 255.799
yeah

252.14 --> 258.839
[Music]

255.799 --> 261.759
right yeah yesterday's

258.839 --> 266.28
[Music]

261.759 --> 266.28000000000003
stream was interesting but

268.6 --> 274.24
frustrating

270.96 --> 276.0
the whole Polaris thing is like it's

274.24 --> 279.96000000000004
very

276.0 --> 285.479
tricky let's just say I am not 100% sure

279.96 --> 285.479
about my case when I present that it

286.6 --> 295.28000000000003
just I can't get this conclusive

291.039 --> 298.8
evidence either way cuz nobody's like

295.28 --> 301.55999999999995
going there to do the actual cross test

298.8 --> 301.56
right underneath

302.479 --> 308.08
Polaris I mean there's like they say

306.0 --> 311.28
they went

308.08 --> 313.44
there but where is like oh yeah and then

311.28 --> 315.75899999999996
they did Celestial navigation and then

313.44 --> 320.319
to make sure that Polaris is actually

315.759 --> 323.97
directly above like no that

320.319 --> 325.56
information is completely elusive thus

323.97 --> 330.199
[Music]

325.56 --> 332.039
far right but my point now is I was

330.199 --> 335.52000000000004
trying to make a point yesterday about

332.039 --> 340.36
the whole Polaris it might be actually a

335.52 --> 340.35999999999996
line not a singular point that you're

340.639 --> 346.8
surrounding there's just not enough

343.96 --> 351.63899999999995
evidence thus far to

346.8 --> 357.84000000000003
really convince me of the super

351.639 --> 357.84000000000003
position of the yeah to be absolutely

358.479 --> 361.479
certain

364.52 --> 368.56
what what the hell does that

369.37 --> 372.649
[Music]

380.479 --> 387.36
mean

383.0 --> 387.36

thing I don't think she has like a

891.32 --> 896.36
properly working

893.959 --> 900.68
computer and she hates doing that sort

896.36 --> 900.6800000000001
of thing on her mobile phone

904.519 --> 910.839
so yeah but mostly she just does not

907.56 --> 910.8389999999999
have time for that kind of

911.36 --> 915.0
nonsense very busy

917.26 --> 922.4399999999999
[Music]

919.6 --> 926.16
lady and with nonsense I mean just like

922.44 --> 929.399

926.16 --> 932.0
like some people have all the time in

929.399 --> 935.399

it n but I was just referencing you

947.319 --> 950.519
watching YouTube in

951.56 --> 956.88
general when you're that busy you just

953.88 --> 956.88
don't have time for

957.6 --> 960.6
that

971.64 --> 980.85
[Music]

987.519 --> 990.519
h

994.67 --> 997.9599999999999
[Music]

1004.72 --> 1009.8000000000001
[Music]

1006.36 --> 1009.8000000000001
wow that's

1011.399 --> 1014.399
crazy

1014.6 --> 1020.48
dang I just reading something this is

1017.24 --> 1020.48
really crazy

1022.24 --> 1026.799
like an economic

1023.839 --> 1031.6000000000001
thing I'm just reading into this this is

1026.799 --> 1034.52
weird I mean it it I I'm just bumping

1031.6 --> 1037.319
into this I in for war so who knows

1034.52 --> 1040.48
according to this because Trump

1037.319 --> 1043.36
basically had a speech some time back

1040.48 --> 1046.039
about like putting tariffs on China and

1043.36 --> 1050.3999999999999
that is apparently provably caused like

1046.039 --> 1050.4
a they call a dead cat bounce

1050.96 --> 1056.679
drop in like the entire Chinese stock

1053.919 --> 1058.8400000000001
market as a direct response like what

1056.679 --> 1061.48
the

1058.84 --> 1064.799
[ __ ] and like he's officially not even

1061.48 --> 1064.799
president like

1069.96 --> 1073.3600000000001
what that's just

1077.4 --> 1084.799
freaky and like bizarre that Chinese

1081.799 --> 1088.1589999999999
economy is like fragile fragile enough

1084.799 --> 1091.76
just a guy saying something can

1088.159 --> 1095.0800000000002
make it plunge that hard that

1091.76 --> 1095.08
that's kind of

1097.039 --> 1102.04
weird

1099.76 --> 1105.19
yeah

1102.04 --> 1105.19
[Music]

1107.32 --> 1112.3999999999999
anyway

1109.36 --> 1115.4799999999998
but I mean my friend what we mostly talk

1112.4 --> 1117.799
about is like social relationships

1115.48 --> 1121.08
and dealing with

1117.799 --> 1122.84
people and like people that get

1121.08 --> 1126.559
demonically

1122.84 --> 1128.6
possessed because we me and her deal

1126.559 --> 1130.039
with that all the time it's a it's a

1128.6 --> 1133.0
typical Hazard

1130.039 --> 1135.679
of intelligent people spirited

1133.0 --> 1137.88
intelligent people other people can't

1135.679 --> 1140.3600000000001
match up to that then they get kind of

1137.88 --> 1142.88
subconscious iously

1140.36 --> 1146.32
jealous and then they start acting out

1142.88 --> 1149.3600000000001
against you and all that or trying

1146.32 --> 1153.52
to dominate you and that kind of

1149.36 --> 1155.4399999999998
thing and so she deals with that all the

1153.52 --> 1157.84
time people are like trying to get in

1155.44 --> 1160.24
her way like a lot and that like

1157.84 --> 1163.24
including freaking friends like

1160.24 --> 1165.1200000000001
everybody does it like it's kind of a

1163.24 --> 1167.24
nut house with her

1165.12 --> 1171.559
sometimes

1167.24 --> 1174.159
but she is like really

1171.559 --> 1177.48
developing

1174.159 --> 1179.88
herself in it getting so much better at

1177.48 --> 1181.48
it and like well so am I and and we talk

1179.88 --> 1183.679
about it's almost like hey how much

1181.48 --> 1185.96
better have you gotten how much better

1183.679 --> 1188.159
have you gotten and like we prove it

1185.96 --> 1190.1200000000001
it's not just like oh I'm so much better

1188.159 --> 1191.2800000000002
no we actually then prove it with

1190.12 --> 1194.1999999999998
examples

1191.28 --> 1197.36
and like I'm capable of describing

1194.2 --> 1200.919
details about myself very eloquently I'm

1197.36 --> 1204.0
like a professional Mar gilby and she

1200.919 --> 1206.7990000000002
can good enough for me to like really

1204.0 --> 1209.799
get it and sometimes like I just finish

1206.799 --> 1213.039
your sentences like I explain exactly

1209.799 --> 1213.039
what she was trying to

1213.84 --> 1218.8799999999999
explain right

1216.48 --> 1221.919
so but yeah she's

1218.88 --> 1225.7990000000002
really doing

1221.919 --> 1229.0
great despite being extremely busy and

1225.799 --> 1231.72
her kid has now entered the rebellious

1229.0 --> 1234.36
face

1231.72 --> 1236.799
like like she's six and she's like

1234.36 --> 1239.8799999999999
really doing the rebellion and like with

1236.799 --> 1242.679
a really intelligent person that's in a

1239.88 --> 1246.7990000000002
life setting where not really surrounded

1242.679 --> 1249.0
by the very picture of stability except

1246.799 --> 1251.48
like Mother's efforts is pretty much the

1249.0 --> 1254.84
stability and the rest it's all dad is

1251.48 --> 1257.039
like it's kind of nuts it's like a kind

1254.84 --> 1257.039
of

1257.12 --> 1261.6399999999999
irresponsible

1259.0 --> 1265.32
like he's trying his best but he is just

1261.64 --> 1268.48
like like a kid he just won't grow up

1265.32 --> 1271.08
basically like for real emotional and

1268.48 --> 1273.0
just like never taking responsibility

1271.08 --> 1275.08
for

1273.0 --> 1276.799
anything like if something goes wrong

1275.08 --> 1279.3999999999999
you always blame somebody else that kind

1276.799 --> 1282.4
of thing this

1279.4 --> 1284.799
like so yeah not a picture of stability

1282.4 --> 1287.039
in total and then yeah you freaking

1284.799 --> 1289.4
Rebels just

1287.039 --> 1292.76
like doing

1289.4 --> 1298.279
that so yeah quite a hassle at home for

1292.76 --> 1298.279
her but uh she's still holding strong

1300.12 --> 1305.6789999999999
and and it's so it's going in the right

1303.6 --> 1307.799
direction like I got a good feeling

1305.679 --> 1312.2
about

1307.799 --> 1314.6
it so like 5 years ago everything in her

1312.2 --> 1318.44
life at all the people all the

1314.6 --> 1321.08
situations were way worse like much more

1318.44 --> 1323.919
unstable and like she would have like

1321.08 --> 1325.84
regular nervous breakdown like real full

1323.919 --> 1329.8400000000001
nervous breakdown

1325.84 --> 1333.6789999999999
[ __ ] not like violence but just like

1329.84 --> 1334.8799999999999
becoming Decap uh decapacitation like

1333.679 --> 1338.72
just

1334.88 --> 1338.72
like over

1339.52 --> 1345.799
tilt and that's not happening as much

1343.08 --> 1348.6
now despite a lot of things still being

1345.799 --> 1349.8799999999999
unstable around here

1348.6 --> 1352.24
because

1349.88 --> 1356.159
people sounds

1352.24 --> 1356.159
familiar sound what sounds

1356.2 --> 1362.559
familiar Carlson being

1358.64 --> 1365.5590000000002
must Poss who

1362.559 --> 1365.559
cares

1374.48 --> 1379.799
Richard yeah what you better damn well

1377.52 --> 1382.9189999999999
believe it he's going to

1379.799 --> 1386.6399999999999
try I mean

1382.919 --> 1386.64
duh but like who

1387.72 --> 1393.159
cares I mean if they do an interview

1390.4 --> 1396.1200000000001
it's just going to be another repetition

1393.159 --> 1398.279
of the pretty open stance that put in

1396.12 --> 1402.08
his

1398.279 --> 1405.72
head I mean you don't get to see it as

1402.08 --> 1409.72
much now if you like go to RT

1405.72 --> 1412.4
like he does like a elaborate speeches

1409.72 --> 1415.039
regularly just laying out the situation

1412.4 --> 1418.159
and everything and like pretty

1415.039 --> 1421.559
accurately so it's not really going to

1418.159 --> 1424.5590000000002
be any revolutionary new revelation or

1421.559 --> 1424.559
anything

1424.919 --> 1427.919
so

1435.2 --> 1446.8400000000001
anyway yeah yes Ste traveler but I

1440.0 --> 1446.84
mean that's Dogecoin like yeah crypto

1449.84 --> 1453.8799999999999
stuff but that's like crypto stuff

1452.88 --> 1455.5200000000002
that's

1453.88 --> 1459.96
not

1455.52 --> 1459.96
like the entire Chinese

1460.96 --> 1469.799
economy it's not just crypto anyway it's

1465.52 --> 1469.799
I find it hard to compare

1482.76 --> 1486.24
heyone buy it's

1487.559 --> 1493.6
you you're going to invest in Bob the

1490.799 --> 1493.6
size SK

1493.72 --> 1498.279
box that is so ridiculous

1496.76 --> 1501.0
man

1498.279 --> 1501.0
that he has

1501.279 --> 1505.32
those what what did they say

1507.399 --> 1513.76
again I'm not super concentrated today I

1510.84 --> 1513.76
miss my fish

1539.399 --> 1543.84
God don't presuppose oh yeah that's what

1541.96 --> 1547.32
he said don't presuppose my logical

1543.84 --> 1547.32
fallacies yeah that's

1551.44 --> 1559.679
God Bittersweet irony it's

1556.679 --> 1559.679
surreal

1562.43 --> 1571.3990000000001
[Music]

1568.159 --> 1573.919
because if you don't get it the

1571.399 --> 1577.6
existential the fractal implications

1573.919 --> 1581.3200000000002
then yeah he probably does think he

1577.6 --> 1583.399
sounds kind of smart but but I mean it

1581.32 --> 1586.2
it really like you and your reference

1583.399 --> 1588.279
frames are ruined kind of he thinks he

1586.2 --> 1590.799
sounds smart

1588.279 --> 1590.799

1593.24 --> 1596.24

1620.399 --> 1625.1999999999998
hey I I I will accept like new

1623.799 --> 1628.2
participants and they might even like

1625.2 --> 1629.679
rolling like uh don't really know how to

1628.2 --> 1631.159
start and say hello I don't want all

1629.679 --> 1633.48
that attention I'm just going to try to

1631.159 --> 1637.0390000000002
get into the conversation but if you're

1633.48 --> 1637.039
going to do that just spouting

1637.52 --> 1643.24
nonsense or like stuff that obviously

1641.559 --> 1646.799
I'm not going to care

1643.24 --> 1648.679
about then you're going to risk being

1646.799 --> 1650.92
identified as a Troll and then I'll just

1648.679 --> 1654.15
kick you

[Music]

1676.519 --> 1683.1200000000001

1679.96 --> 1683.1200000000001
show yesterday that was

1687.12 --> 1693.6399999999999
[Music]

1689.24 --> 1693.64
hilarious yeah that was with Bob right

1706.44 --> 1709.44
yeah

1711.2 --> 1718.64
and I'm GNA think I'm going to turn on

1714.96 --> 1721.48
put my aluminati C saw in the

1718.64 --> 1725.6000000000001
oven maybe turn on my

1721.48 --> 1725.6
coffee yeah be right

1736.399 --> 1739.399
back

1766.32 --> 1769.32

birthday I'm going to be

1816.2 --> 1822.6000000000001
44 all right who wants to talk about

1819.64 --> 1825.24
something need me to Ram something in

1822.6 --> 1826.24
your head again cuz you just can't

1825.24 --> 1829.24
handle

1826.24 --> 1829.24
it

1830.6 --> 1833.48
what should I bring

1834.799 --> 1842.559
on do I need to lay out how

1838.799 --> 1845.399
like arguably like the entire medical

1842.559 --> 1848.84
system is just one giant

1845.399 --> 1851.5189999999998
fraud most of it the models that they

1848.84 --> 1855.8799999999999
have are completely

1851.519 --> 1857.96
wrong that do we need to talk about how

1855.88 --> 1861.0800000000002
the Earth is flat I mean that

1857.96 --> 1861.08
rudimentary I don't

1861.64 --> 1865.019
[Music]

1865.08 --> 1872.279
know like how do you know that the Earth

1870.36 --> 1875.6
is

1872.279 --> 1880.159
flat I believe how do you

1875.6 --> 1880.1589999999999
know how do we know the Earth is

1886.159 --> 1892.6390000000001
lad missing

1889.399 --> 1894.76
curvature Black Swan

1892.639 --> 1897.799
observation oh yeah now I remember what

1894.76 --> 1897.799
I was talking about

1899.48 --> 1905.1200000000001
on on the earth

1901.96 --> 1908.48
Awakenings was about the Black Swan and

1905.12 --> 1912.12
refraction and specifically how

1908.48 --> 1914.0
refraction is under every circumstance

1912.12 --> 1917.6
never capable

1914.0 --> 1920.96
of making something that is geometric Al

1917.6 --> 1923.559
obstructed visible again under any

1920.96 --> 1926.2
circumstance like any and every

1923.559 --> 1928.44
circumstance it's impossible so

1926.2 --> 1929.72
something can be distorted in relation

1928.44 --> 1933.3200000000002
to something

1929.72 --> 1933.32
else or even

1933.88 --> 1937.96
hidden but you can't unhide something

1937.24 --> 1941.279
you

1937.96 --> 1943.919
can't under every type of refraction

1941.279 --> 1948.519
circumstance something is never like

1943.919 --> 1950.6390000000001
made visible that is geom metrically OBU

1948.519 --> 1953.96
obstructed from the

1950.639 --> 1958.84
viewer yeah that is literally in the

1953.96 --> 1960.679
actual refraction effect this is Optics

1958.84 --> 1964.24
research

1960.679 --> 1969.039
miring all that kind of stuff refraction

1964.24 --> 1971.639
based effects visual effects they never

1969.039 --> 1976.039
ever make something that's physically

1971.639 --> 1977.559
blocked from your line of sight become

1976.039 --> 1980.44
visible

1977.559 --> 1983.519
yeah so this whole notion of terrestrial

1980.44 --> 1986.1200000000001
refraction making it look flat is

1983.519 --> 1990.799
absolute ridiculous science fiction

1986.12 --> 1990.799
that's not based in actual physics or

1993.279 --> 1999.2
Optics you can't

1995.399 --> 2002.36
see what should be geometrically

1999.2 --> 2004.88
obstructed doesn't matter like what kind

2002.36 --> 2008.9599999999998
of weird temperature layers there are

2004.88 --> 2008.96
like it doesn't matter

2009.039 --> 2015.0
refraction light Distortion can't make

2012.36 --> 2017.9599999999998
things visible that are directly

2015.0 --> 2017.96
obstructed from

2026.399 --> 2034.039
side what about a lens that bends light

2029.76 --> 2038.08
so you can see what's hiding yeah well

2034.039 --> 2040.519
the air is not that lens though

2038.08 --> 2042.6789999999999
yeah I mean yeah you could use a mirror

2040.519 --> 2045.08
yeah you could use a mirror to see

2042.679 --> 2048.159
what's behind what's something that's

2045.08 --> 2051.119
geometrically obstructed but like

2048.159 --> 2055.119
looking through the air no that doesn't

2051.119 --> 2055.119
do that stey

2059.32 --> 2065.8790000000004
traveler yeah a lens or a mirror any

2063.48 --> 2070.2400000000002
kind of like

2065.879 --> 2070.24
medium distorting

2080.919 --> 2087.72
thing I mean I have no idea how the hell

2083.96 --> 2087.7200000000003
a len like what are you talking

2095.879 --> 2098.879
about

2100.92 --> 2106.04
see me traveler what the [ __ ] are you

2103.4 --> 2108.52
talking about where the hell did you get

2106.04 --> 2110.92
this kind of info

2108.52 --> 2113.28
from and why the [ __ ] would you bring

2110.92 --> 2116.48
that up when I'm talking about

2113.28 --> 2118.5600000000004
refraction with your eyes do we have

2116.48 --> 2122.96
that lens in our

2118.56 --> 2122.96
eyes do we have that in the

2123.599 --> 2128.8
camera what are you talking about

2129.16 --> 2133.52
if you're going to insert like a

2131.04 --> 2137.2
completely new piece of data you better

2133.52 --> 2137.2
be ready to expound on

2155.8 --> 2158.8
it

2173.079 --> 2178.599
you just respond you can't bend around

2175.0 --> 2178.599
the geometric up yeah that's

2185.72 --> 2188.72
right

2190.48 --> 2197.2
what is what kind of response is

2194.079 --> 2199.28
that so you're just you're just stating

2197.2 --> 2202.1189999999997
then like oh there is a lens so yeah you

2199.28 --> 2206.4
can do that

2202.119 --> 2210.04
where what is that I've never heard of

2206.4 --> 2210.04
that that's really

2215.68 --> 2218.96
weird

2217.44 --> 2221.28
it sounds like it could just be

2218.96 --> 2225.56
completely made up and it's really

2221.28 --> 2225.5600000000004
puzzling why you bring this up all of a

2225.92 --> 2231.66
sudden that's even a real

2228.47 --> 2231.66
[Music]

2245.599 --> 2248.6800000000003
thing

2247.64 --> 2251.48
okay

2248.68 --> 2253.7999999999997
that's what you've seen those things

2251.48 --> 2253.8
what the

2255.0 --> 2259.839
lenses lenses that look around a

2260.2 --> 2263.48
corner what the

2264.64 --> 2271.2
hell seem to no but it's it's just very

2268.28 --> 2275.599
puzzling that you bring it

2271.2 --> 2278.5989999999997
up you don't have to go away it's

2275.599 --> 2278.599
just

2280.86 --> 2285.599
[Music]

2283.119 --> 2290.0
do you have any source for that you know

2285.599 --> 2290.0
what those lenses are called that do

2290.04 --> 2294.16
that don't just walk

2305.52 --> 2308.52
away

2314.04 --> 2318.24
because I want to know what these lenses

2315.839 --> 2318.24
are

2318.88 --> 2323.28

2423.56 --> 2428.359
CH

2425.359 --> 2428.359
what

2429.72 --> 2435.3999999999996
what okay so that yeah but that's

2432.839 --> 2438.96
digital thanks

2435.4 --> 2442.8
Mark Bel try

2438.96 --> 2447.28
me yeah but that's not actually like a

2442.8 --> 2447.28
like a a lens or anything that does

2455.319 --> 2460.92
that like you'd actually have to know

2458.76 --> 2460.92
the

2467.599 --> 2474.319
terrain my point is is

2470.839 --> 2478.2
that through regular

2474.319 --> 2483.68
Optics lensing light

2478.2 --> 2483.68
mechanics you can't see behind the

2483.96 --> 2488.88
corner steamy traveler apparent Cur ly

2487.0 --> 2491.839
read something about that that is

2488.88 --> 2494.28
possible and then I upset him and now he

2491.839 --> 2498.04
ran away for [ __ ]

2494.28 --> 2498.0400000000004
sake incredibly

2511.079 --> 2517.52
helpful nitrogen on a pipe yeah that's

2514.0 --> 2520.48
very cumu that's not the environment

2517.52 --> 2523.44
though yeah that's not what we're

2520.48 --> 2523.44
looking at out

2533.8 --> 2541.8
there and besides that is much more

2537.8 --> 2541.8
reminiscent to an actual mirror

2543.079 --> 2551.119
effect it's extreme

2547.319 --> 2555.7599999999998
form of bending of light that in reality

2551.119 --> 2558.76
doesn't happen without a hard border

2555.76 --> 2558.76
transition of

2575.16 --> 2578.16
material

2589.119 --> 2595.88
what they use mirrors but that makes no

2605.079 --> 2608.079
sense

2614.92 --> 2621.28
would need nitrogen less of a

2618.64 --> 2623.0
yeah yeah you'd still need that hard

2621.28 --> 2626.76
border

2623.0 --> 2630.839
eh yeah let the nitrogen just settle and

2626.76 --> 2630.8390000000004
expand and oh yeah it doesn't do that at

2635.079 --> 2639.92
all

2637.28 --> 2644.52
how does light continue to curve through

2639.92 --> 2644.52
sugar water o dexra rotation

2644.92 --> 2649.359
really so where does that happen in the

2657.64 --> 2663.96
air yeah it's ridiculous a kumu

2661.24 --> 2666.359
virus can't see behind Corners this is

2663.96 --> 2668.52
standard Optics I mean these things were

2666.359 --> 2673.16
worked out

2668.52 --> 2675.52
like I think late 19th century or

2673.16 --> 2677.7999999999997
something like all the

2675.52 --> 2680.04
phenomena there's no

2677.8 --> 2682.92
phenomenon

2680.04 --> 2685.839
ever looking at the Horizon and then

2682.92 --> 2689.92
seeing something made visible that is

2685.839 --> 2689.92
geometrically obstructed by like a

2691.64 --> 2698.5589999999997
hill refra it's called dextra rotation

2694.88 --> 2698.559
that specific effect in sugar

2699.839 --> 2704.839
water it can happen yeah except it's

2702.839 --> 2708.64
officially

2704.839 --> 2710.44
recorded as not being able to happen so

2708.64 --> 2712.96
you could just think of it as being able

2710.44 --> 2716.119
to happen akumu it

2712.96 --> 2719.599
doesn't hey Rich G right

2716.119 --> 2719.599
I'm be right

2724.88 --> 2727.88
back

2754.88 --> 2757.88
for

2767.31 --> 2770.699
[Music]

2773.04 --> 2777.119
oh okay not dexra

2777.2 --> 2782.1189999999997
rotation I thought it was called dexra

2779.4 --> 2784.359
rotation right but whatever I mean I

2782.119 --> 2786.92
what can I say about this nonsense with

2784.359 --> 2789.4
sugar water and everything

2786.92 --> 2792.52
like if you really think that light is

2789.4 --> 2795.0
bending then put a

2792.52 --> 2798.0
rod in that

2795.0 --> 2800.0
water right around the bending of the

2798.0 --> 2801.44
water let's see if it still goes around

2800.0 --> 2804.44
it

2801.44 --> 2804.44
then

2805.599 --> 2812.28
yeah cuz yeah oh it seems to go an arc

2809.359 --> 2814.5589999999997
in the water that's cute so does that

2812.28 --> 2817.28
mean that if you put like a physical

2814.559 --> 2819.2000000000003
obstruction in the the middle of the arc

2817.28 --> 2822.44
that it's actually still going to go to

2819.2 --> 2826.04
the other side they didn't test that of

2822.44 --> 2828.04
course right you just assume it right

2826.04 --> 2832.68
right it's not even about like that

2828.04 --> 2835.72
light can't seem to like show or appear

2832.68 --> 2839.24
to have some kind of a curve to The

2835.72 --> 2842.0
Observer it's about that it's not

2839.24 --> 2845.4799999999996
capable of making things visible that

2842.0 --> 2850.359
are behind physical obstruction yeah in

2845.48 --> 2853.52
that light Dex sugar water appears

2850.359 --> 2854.92
appearing to be bending thing there's no

2853.52 --> 2859.28
physical

2854.92 --> 2859.28
object that's inside of the

2859.44 --> 2867.2000000000003
arc around which the light is literally

2863.319 --> 2870.04
moving like beyond the obstruction

2867.2 --> 2870.04
that's not part of

2873.359 --> 2876.92
that right and that's what it's all

2875.319 --> 2879.64
about that's my entire statement here

2876.92 --> 2882.76
it's like no I don't I don't even care

2879.64 --> 2882.7599999999998
if you think that light

2883.52 --> 2893.459
bends it doesn't go around a physical

2888.89 --> 2893.459
[Music]

2895.58 --> 2898.94
[Music]

2901.559 --> 2908.48
obstruction dri nitrogen on it yeah well

2904.64 --> 2911.5589999999997
nitrogen that's liquid nitrogen right so

2908.48 --> 2914.92
you you drip a fluid on it well you know

2911.559 --> 2917.2000000000003
what a fluid like has reflective

2914.92 --> 2921.16
capabilities doesn't it right so it can

2917.2 --> 2921.16
literally work like a mirror on the

2922.72 --> 2929.2799999999997
inside yeah if the liquid on a surface

2926.4 --> 2931.4
it often becomes reflective so it's

2929.28 --> 2933.0
almost like the liquid that you pour on

2931.4 --> 2936.599
it could

2933.0 --> 2939.0
theoretically be almost like a

2936.599 --> 2942.1600000000003
a fiber optic cable kind of effect it's

2939.0 --> 2945.16
just like going in between there and

2942.16 --> 2945.16
emerging on the other

2945.68 --> 2950.2
side the point is it's not a gas it's

2948.799 --> 2953.16
not

2950.2 --> 2956.04
regular non hard

2953.16 --> 2959.8799999999997
bordered

2956.04 --> 2963.4
medium yeah that nitrogen is

2959.88 --> 2967.52
liquid you don't just pour really dense

2963.4 --> 2967.52
nitrogen gas over it now do you

2969.76 --> 2972.8390000000004
pour liquid over

2984.24 --> 2989.3999999999996
it piece of metal in a tank with sugar

2987.0 --> 2992.839
solution L your ban around really oh we

2989.4 --> 2992.839
did do that

2994.52 --> 2999.4
huh

2997.0 --> 3002.839
I never caught that that's interesting

2999.4 --> 3002.839
I'd love to see that

3016.44 --> 3023.16
actually right so you're all just going

3019.119 --> 3025.52
to insist right you're all being

3023.16 --> 3029.0
permanent ballards like you got the

3025.52 --> 3032.92
idence refraction is

3029.0 --> 3035.599
real the Earth is a ball it's curved

3032.92 --> 3037.44
into an apparent flat plane and that

3035.599 --> 3039.52
explains the Black Swan observations

3037.44 --> 3042.88
because it's not really there you really

3039.52 --> 3044.64
believe that [ __ ] don't you it's really

3042.88 --> 3048.7200000000003
sick

3044.64 --> 3048.72
dude [ __ ] sick in the

3054.44 --> 3059.88
head

3056.559 --> 3062.96
seriously that's really

3059.88 --> 3064.7200000000003
disturbing that you guys hold on to that

3062.96 --> 3067.4
really [ __ ]

3064.72 --> 3069.799
[Music]

3067.4 --> 3072.359
disturbing yeah you remember that that's

3069.799 --> 3074.68
cool but I'm not necessarily talking

3072.359 --> 3074.68
about

3084.359 --> 3089.88
you

3086.119 --> 3090.96
I can't explain that I if hey look if in

3089.88 --> 3093.799
sugar

3090.96 --> 3096.079
water it can indeed go around a cent I

3093.799 --> 3099.079
can't explain that I just can't I don't

3096.079 --> 3099.079
know why the [ __ ] that

3101.319 --> 3104.96
happens that's really

3110.64 --> 3116.319
mysterious it can happen on Flat Earth

3113.88 --> 3119.76
too hey but

3116.319 --> 3123.0
yeah sure well maybe it can it's really

3119.76 --> 3128.079
weird doesn't happen in just

3123.0 --> 3128.079
regular non hard bordered mediums

3128.28 --> 3133.559
though cuz all refraction ever is is

3131.119 --> 3136.28
about like hard bordered mediums from

3133.559 --> 3136.28
one to

3137.119 --> 3145.0
another see mirages across yeah that's

3140.16 --> 3148.0
cool I mean if it's hot yeah ground can

3145.0 --> 3150.28
become like a mirror Etc sure Mirage

3148.0 --> 3150.28
just

3152.72 --> 3160.5989999999997
happened but those are reflections

3157.04 --> 3164.4
though imagery reflecting a layer

3160.599 --> 3167.799
reflecting a layer yeah it's not

3164.4 --> 3170.48
actually like in a straight line like

3167.799 --> 3173.359
going around something

3170.48 --> 3177.2400000000002
physical it's reflecting from one spot

3173.359 --> 3177.24
to the other

3182.44 --> 3187.77
when it's really

3184.56 --> 3187.77
[Music]

3188.76 --> 3193.7990000000004
hot over a really large distance it

3191.72 --> 3197.319
could do that

3193.799 --> 3199.32
really the atmosphere you say yeah gas

3197.319 --> 3202.519
doesn't take the shape of sphere

3199.32 --> 3202.5190000000002
[Music]

3202.96 --> 3207.16
though takes the shape of its

3221.76 --> 3226.96
containment that's what it's called only

3224.24 --> 3226.9599999999996
if you name

3231.92 --> 3238.119
it atmosphere does it mean sphere share

3235.44 --> 3238.119
gas oh

3238.16 --> 3245.2
really what does Atmos mean atmo what

3241.96 --> 3245.2
does atmo mean AUM

3247.88 --> 3255.119
virus and then what does Sphere

3252.48 --> 3260.28
mean so you're telling me atmosphere

3255.119 --> 3264.079
doesn't mean gas sphere does it I think

3260.28 --> 3267.079
it quite literally does mean

3264.079 --> 3267.079
that

3269.24 --> 3277.3999999999996
yeah sphere is is that's the name of a

3273.48 --> 3277.4
shape Atmos is

3278.72 --> 3287.0789999999997
gas dragon flies aren't really dragons

3283.24 --> 3290.839
either they aren't that's why it's one

3287.079 --> 3296.119
word that's why dragon fly is not Dragon

3290.839 --> 3301.0789999999997
space fly it's dragon fly yeah of course

3296.119 --> 3301.079
dragonflies aren't dragons that's

3302.52 --> 3308.319
ridiculous it's one

3305.48 --> 3310.2400000000002
word there's other things that have the

3308.319 --> 3314.68
word dragon in

3310.24 --> 3318.16
them yeah dragon as we use for Fantasy

3314.68 --> 3323.7599999999998
Dragons that's actually a colloquial

3318.16 --> 3328.0389999999998
short of like a an arch typal

3323.76 --> 3328.039
word the Dragon

3328.079 --> 3332.7200000000003
okay

3329.799 --> 3335.44
Dr there's all kinds of stuff that

3332.72 --> 3337.9599999999996
there's Dragon basically is like the

3335.44 --> 3342.119
short of and there's many words in which

3337.96 --> 3344.92
dragon is used as part of the

3342.119 --> 3347.6800000000003
word it's not because it has anything to

3344.92 --> 3351.2000000000003
do with a fictional Dragon it's because

3347.68 --> 3354.0
the word dragon is a typical part of a

3351.2 --> 3355.52
whole set of

3354.0 --> 3358.119
constructions

3355.52 --> 3358.119
different

3358.319 --> 3362.0
meanings so

3365.44 --> 3373.079
anyway if there's containment no trip to

3368.76 --> 3374.48
moon or a Mars yeah right but I mean

3373.079 --> 3377.079
trip to

3374.48 --> 3380.2
what the claim that those places are

3377.079 --> 3382.52
actually physical places is already like

3380.2 --> 3382.52
kind of

3383.92 --> 3391.0
absurd

3386.92 --> 3391.0
catfish aren't I wouldn't

3394.839 --> 3400.52
know that's right jellyfish isn't a fish

3397.68 --> 3400.52
made of jelly

3404.799 --> 3409.799
either anyway I'm going to get my coffee

3407.119 --> 3409.799
I'll be right

3413.88 --> 3416.88
back

3473.799 --> 3476.799
um

3487.33 --> 3498.859
[Music]

3500.16 --> 3504.48
yeah can see your blue P Evolution I

3501.96 --> 3507.68
kind of need some backup here like I'm

3504.48 --> 3510.92
getting [ __ ] overrun by these freak

3507.68 --> 3510.9199999999996
Bart [ __ ]

3513.48 --> 3516.659
[Music]

3519.52 --> 3522.69
[Music]

3522.88 --> 3528.599
man I can't type quick up on your

3525.56 --> 3528.599
[Music]

3533.72 --> 3536.72
phone

3538.2 --> 3544.359
all right so yeah enough about damn

3540.88 --> 3544.359
words bunch of

3544.559 --> 3550.7200000000003
kids my point is in the regular air

3551.119 --> 3558.839
circumstance light doesn't bend around a

3554.64 --> 3562.0
corner yeah and to say like oh but

3558.839 --> 3566.48
liquid nitrogen or whatever

3562.0 --> 3569.359
or sugar water yeah you can't then say

3566.48 --> 3571.88
well if it worked at the liquid nitrogen

3569.359 --> 3576.48
or the sugar water you could think of

3571.88 --> 3579.4
air as really thin liquid nitrogen or

3576.48 --> 3581.28
really thin sugar water that's just

3579.4 --> 3585.52
really spread out it's doing the same

3581.28 --> 3590.039
thing no it's completely different

3585.52 --> 3592.799
effect yeah that's not

3590.039 --> 3595.8390000000004
air there light that's not going through

3592.799 --> 3598.319
air yeah I mean I could could say like w

3595.839 --> 3601.16
look at this

3598.319 --> 3602.92
mirror you could see something that's

3601.16 --> 3605.52
there behind the corner because of the

3602.92 --> 3609.88
mirror well you could just think of the

3605.52 --> 3612.68
mirror as really condensed atmosphere

3609.88 --> 3614.96
yeah it's it's the it's a really condens

3612.68 --> 3617.48
atmosphere that makes the signal bounce

3614.96 --> 3619.92
you just like yeah you just the mirror

3617.48 --> 3623.0
it's just a yeah you could think of

3619.92 --> 3625.079
things and effects that you do as being

3623.0 --> 3627.039
like the air

3625.079 --> 3629.76
but then really

3627.039 --> 3632.3590000000004
compacted but it isn't you could think

3629.76 --> 3634.4
of such things but it isn't cuz that's

3632.359 --> 3636.24
not the circumstance that's not the

3634.4 --> 3640.1600000000003
properties of the

3636.24 --> 3642.4399999999996
material at all again just like have a

3640.16 --> 3644.2799999999997
unique effect in a really compressed

3642.44 --> 3646.44
situation with like hard borders and

3644.28 --> 3649.599
then expect like oh if you just thin it

3646.44 --> 3652.119
up really a lot and spread it out it'll

3649.599 --> 3656.52
do the same thing no it

3652.119 --> 3656.52
won't not at all

3657.48 --> 3663.359
like demonstrate it then without

3667.4 --> 3675.76
presupposing like find a really big

3671.52 --> 3677.81
hill yeah that's that's much more

3675.76 --> 3679.48
even and then do it with

3677.81 --> 3682.319
[Music]

3679.48 --> 3688.28
that like where it's actually measured

3682.319 --> 3688.2799999999997
like a a hill not just presupposed to

3690.039 --> 3693.7200000000003
be have different densities and

3692.24 --> 3696.8799999999997
different players yeah but no hard

3693.72 --> 3699.68
layers though there's no big hard layer

3696.88 --> 3701.92
differences not without a storm breaking

3699.68 --> 3701.9199999999996
out

3713.44 --> 3716.44
immediately

3717.92 --> 3723.2000000000003
yeah you do need hard layers kumu that's

3720.88 --> 3726.2000000000003
the whole point of refraction is you

3723.2 --> 3728.2
need very distinct layers if it's not

3726.2 --> 3729.5989999999997
hard layers then it's not going to do

3728.2 --> 3732.0
the same

3729.599 --> 3735.799
thing it's not going to change that

3732.0 --> 3737.76
angle there there's if there's no

3735.799 --> 3740.7599999999998
distinct

3737.76 --> 3740.76
borders

3741.4 --> 3746.64
yeah I'm going to get this Illumina

3744.16 --> 3746.64
anyway wa

3752.53 --> 3756.119
[Music]

3773.359 --> 3776.359
cheers

3778.279 --> 3783.63
density layers the hell's density layers

3781.24 --> 3786.8799999999997
have to do with

3783.63 --> 3786.88
[Music]

3789.16 --> 3794.52
anything according to your logic there

3792.079 --> 3797.599
should be terrestrial refraction when

3794.52 --> 3799.7599999999998
you look straight down or straight up

3797.599 --> 3806.279
cuz that's how the layers are divided

3799.76 --> 3806.279
yeah refraction needs vertical layers

3807.52 --> 3813.359
vertical it's supposed to be bending

3810.2 --> 3818.73
that way right well then you need a

3813.359 --> 3825.909
vertical layer not a horizontal one

3818.73 --> 3825.909
[Music]

3831.11 --> 3836.279
[Music]

3833.279 --> 3836.279
yeah

3842.319 --> 3848.2
there is no refraction within a

3848.57 --> 3852.92
[Music]

3850.119 --> 3854.839
layer like that there is none the

3852.92 --> 3858.839
refraction

3854.839 --> 3862.24
happens that yeah

3858.839 --> 3865.16
layers would have to be

3862.24 --> 3869.0389999999998
vertical in order for any kind of

3865.16 --> 3873.3999999999996
refraction effect to actually

3869.039 --> 3875.2200000000003
happen the layers aren't

3873.4 --> 3877.839
vertical

3875.22 --> 3881.279
[Music]

3877.839 --> 3883.16
yeah now I don't mean horizontal why

3881.279 --> 3885.44
don't you say horizontal one more

3883.16 --> 3887.92
[ __ ] time and I'll time you out for

3885.44 --> 3887.92
24

3888.279 --> 3892.88
hours

3890.279 --> 3896.279
vertical the layers would have to be

3892.88 --> 3900.039
vertical in order for it to look

3896.279 --> 3904.839
horizontal and have an angle

3900.039 --> 3904.8390000000004
change the layer would have to be

3905.0 --> 3909.68
vertical you have to Vertical

3910.44 --> 3913.44
what

3919.839 --> 3927.119
wow I think you uh might have roasted

3923.16 --> 3927.1189999999997
that brain of your a little bit

3927.599 --> 3933.3590000000004
Palpatine we definitely don't have a

3930.52 --> 3935.88
vertical density layer

3933.359 --> 3939.359
dumbass that's the whole point you would

3935.88 --> 3941.44
have to if you want refraction to like

3939.359 --> 3943.7599999999998
bend around a corner

3941.44 --> 3945.64
continually but you don't that's the

3943.76 --> 3946.76
whole point that's my statement that's

3945.64 --> 3950.279
my

3946.76 --> 3956.079
point think about it for a second yeah

3950.279 --> 3956.079
we don't have a distinct border yeah

3968.079 --> 3971.3590000000004
vertical pressure

3976.44 --> 3980.96
radi the pressure grade yeah but that's

3979.52 --> 3983.0
that has no

3980.96 --> 3986.48
influence

3983.0 --> 3991.119
barely the amount of refraction in any

3986.48 --> 3993.119
kind of regular air typically is just

3991.119 --> 3996.119
one pressure to the other it's not that

3993.119 --> 3996.119
much of a difference

3998.319 --> 4005.319
really and it's not if it's layered like

4002.039 --> 4007.119
this if there's differences that are

4005.319 --> 4009.52
distributed

4007.119 --> 4013.0
horizontally then you can't have the

4009.52 --> 4014.88
light bending hey D good see

4013.0 --> 4019.76
you

4014.88 --> 4024.2400000000002
refraction only works when it's like

4019.76 --> 4024.2400000000002
perpendicular to the medium

4025.839 --> 4031.359
change if there are layers somehow here

4029.68 --> 4034.0
on Earth

4031.359 --> 4037.319
supposedly well then they're horizontal

4034.0 --> 4039.079
aren't they right the gas gradient or

4037.319 --> 4041.799
whatever and all the things and the

4039.079 --> 4044.799
water is all horizontal

4041.799 --> 4047.24
right yeah

4044.799 --> 4049.799
so not the right conditions to have a

4047.24 --> 4052.319
continual Optical effect where light is

4049.799 --> 4055.92
getting bend around the corner because

4052.319 --> 4059.24
that requires vertical

4981.92 --> 4986.4800000000005
not

4984.159 --> 4988.638999999999
horizontal so yeah light might bend

4986.48 --> 4991.199
slightly if you look up or down then it

4988.639 --> 4994.84
might oh it might bend or something

4991.199 --> 4994.839999999999
right that's that's what that would

4995.96 --> 5001.4800000000005
do yeah but when you

4999.88 --> 5004.8
look

5001.48 --> 5006.159
parallel two set gradient there should

5004.8 --> 5009.6
be

5006.159 --> 5013.199
zero influence

5009.6 --> 5016.159000000001
zero because there's no hard change

5013.199 --> 5018.08
you're literally looking parallel so

5016.159 --> 5020.239
you're looking through a

5018.08 --> 5024.12
homogeneous

5020.239 --> 5026.08
thing there's no influence now yeah this

5024.12 --> 5028.04
supposed pressure gradient that we

5026.08 --> 5030.32
experience if that's going to lead to

5028.04 --> 5034.8
some kind of refraction it would only do

5030.32 --> 5035.96
so when you look up and down not when

5034.8 --> 5039.2390000000005
you look

5035.96 --> 5042.719
horizontal have no influence whatsoever

5039.239 --> 5042.718999999999
like zero

5046.36 --> 5052.44
influence because the pressure gradient

5048.88 --> 5056.4400000000005
doesn't build up vertically like that

5052.44 --> 5058.0
there's no oh here's this amount of

5056.44 --> 5059.719
pressure and oh here's this amount of

5058.0 --> 5061.76
pressure right next to it and and next

5059.719 --> 5064.56
to that there's another amount of no no

5061.76 --> 5067.8
that's not how it orders itself yeah

5064.56 --> 5071.1990000000005
orders itself

5067.8 --> 5071.1990000000005
horizontally that's

[ __ ] uh well yeah I mean blue it's it's

5155.8 --> 5160.119000000001
nice to say it like

5157.4 --> 5162.32
that why doesn't the government do this

5160.119 --> 5166.04
but the government and NASA actually

5162.32 --> 5166.04
admit that the Earth is measured

5166.84 --> 5173.32
flat remember that these document they

5170.159 --> 5175.599999999999
are out there like even like in Airplane

5173.32 --> 5177.799999999999
manuals we figured it out like yeah it's

5175.6 --> 5179.719
measured flat like

5177.8 --> 5182.8
that's how it

5179.719 --> 5184.719
works it's kind of a side note like as a

5182.8 --> 5186.92
backdrop parameter just to get

5184.719 --> 5188.639
everything right right the circumstances

5186.92 --> 5190.96
right it's like oh yeah the Earth is

5188.639 --> 5193.08
definitely flat like we're going to

5190.96 --> 5196.52
treat the Earth as if it is

5193.08 --> 5200.5199999999995
flat for purpose of modeling the

5196.52 --> 5200.52
scenario right that that kind of

5202.8 --> 5207.679
thing but I mean NASA has admitted too

5205.28 --> 5210.4
that the Earth is measured flat they

5207.679 --> 5212.84
won't talk about it with their

5210.4 --> 5215.119
astronauts but I mean you can find it in

5212.84 --> 5215.119000000001
their

5217.44 --> 5223.36
documents and we have at Flat Earth

5219.679 --> 5226.5

5318.48 --> 5323.239
yeah BL Blu but I mean even more

5321.6 --> 5325.2390000000005
important than

5323.239 --> 5329.119
that water

5325.239 --> 5331.0
level yeah water level so reliable it's

5329.119 --> 5332.599999999999
it's used

5331.0 --> 5335.239
industrially

5332.6 --> 5337.96
so you take a

5335.239 --> 5341.28
pipe and you put water in the pipe and

5337.96 --> 5342.6
then you just hold the ends and it can

5341.28 --> 5345.8
be at any

5342.6 --> 5348.719
distance and at every point will the

5345.8 --> 5350.6
water at both ends of that pipe like a

5348.719 --> 5353.2390000000005
rain pipe or whatever what do you call

5350.6 --> 5356.52
it flexible

5353.239 --> 5359.879999999999
thing it's going to stay exactly at the

5356.52 --> 5362.8
same height perfectly it's super

5359.88 --> 5365.0
reliable as water level like no matter

5362.8 --> 5367.4800000000005
what you do with the

5365.0 --> 5371.52
pipe when you hold it still the water

5367.48 --> 5373.759999999999
will be on exactly the same height at at

5371.52 --> 5373.76
both

5377.36 --> 5385.0
ends like no matter the distance like it

5381.44 --> 5386.839999999999
knows the water itself like knows it it

5385.0 --> 5389.6
finds an

5386.84 --> 5392.52
equilibrium until it's

5389.6 --> 5394.159000000001
level like even if there's a complex at

5392.52 --> 5397.400000000001
Route in

5394.159 --> 5401.879999999999
between the ends of the pipe like it

5397.4 --> 5401.879999999999
doesn't matter the water will find its

5402.96 --> 5408.43
[Music]

5412.719 --> 5416.6

5417.36 --> 5423.839999999999

5420.0 --> 5423.84
remember it's a pretty happy

5440.79 --> 5443.869
[Music]

5445.56 --> 5450.84

[Music]

5461.57 --> 5464.71
[Music]

5476.88 --> 5482.36
small pills that's very funny but I mean

5479.88 --> 5484.679
the whole water being level

5482.36 --> 5487.5599999999995
there's no limitation on the distance of

5484.679 --> 5490.0
that of how that works as long as

5487.56 --> 5491.360000000001
there's like no freezing of the water

5490.0 --> 5494.08
somewhere and a reach you could

5491.36 --> 5496.839999999999
theoretically have it like a th000 miles

5494.08 --> 5498.76
you could have a tube that is a th000

5496.84 --> 5502.679
miles fill it up with

5498.76 --> 5505.4800000000005
water and it would be perfectly level

5502.679 --> 5508.2390000000005
then you like raise up the

5505.48 --> 5510.32
tube and it's like an immediate response

5508.239 --> 5512.44
on the other side and will whatever you

5510.32 --> 5513.96
do no matter the distance since it will

5512.44 --> 5517.32
remain level there might be like a bit

5513.96 --> 5521.28
of a delay because the water literally

5517.32 --> 5523.119
has to move but it will do that so it's

5521.28 --> 5526.36
like you pick up the tube on one side

5523.119 --> 5528.08
and it like creates a wave that just

5526.36 --> 5533.48
goes all the way to the other side and

5528.08 --> 5533.48
then y y y eventually it levels

5536.199 --> 5542.48
out that's amazing to realize like

5539.199 --> 5545.08
there's no distance limit about the

5542.48 --> 5547.718999999999
leveling out of

5545.08 --> 5550.36
water and also water level is so

5547.719 --> 5553.159
reliable that they actually use it to

5550.36 --> 5557.5599999999995
make perfectly flat

5553.159 --> 5562.0
glass they use water for

5557.56 --> 5562.0
that to get the perfect mirror

small scale or a bigger scale scale is

not local

5715.08 --> 5722.0
it oh Earth to Biggie is that your

argument Brianna I mean your overall

5722.0 --> 5727.32
argument in the last half hour what I've

5724.44 --> 5730.04
seen in chat is Earth too Biggie oh

5727.32 --> 5733.08
you're doing it at too small scale

5730.04 --> 5736.6
it's you have to do it on an earth siiz

5733.08 --> 5741.5599999999995
scale to prove that it's a SP and it is

5736.6 --> 5744.280000000001
bending locally Flat Earth too

5741.56 --> 5746.360000000001
biggie

5744.28 --> 5749.32
right right

5746.36 --> 5753.4
Brianna oh it's not big

5749.32 --> 5757.639
enough how about that gigantic longest

5753.4 --> 5761.879999999999
in the world Chinese bridge over the

5757.639 --> 5766.0
ocean that's like super

5761.88 --> 5769.1990000000005
flat yeah is that big enough for

5766.0 --> 5770.6
you is that big enough scale for you oh

5769.199 --> 5772.719
that's too

5770.6 --> 5776.08
small

5772.719 --> 5780.08
it's you're still locally

5776.08 --> 5783.88
flat no it's really

5780.08 --> 5787.719
long it's very

5783.88 --> 5789.159000000001
flat if you drive over it you'll have

5787.719 --> 5791.88
this weird

5789.159 --> 5795.08
sensation like whoa going in the

5791.88 --> 5798.04
straight line that directly to the

5795.08 --> 5799.6
Horizon no curving no bending just going

5798.04 --> 5802.44
there in a straight line and everything

5799.6 --> 5804.639
looks the same

5802.44 --> 5807.919999999999
yeah perfectly

5804.639 --> 5810.28
flat that's how they built it because

5807.92 --> 5812.1990000000005
that's how it

5810.28 --> 5815.5599999999995
works

5812.199 --> 5821.44
they built a flat bridge over the flat

5815.56 --> 5821.4400000000005
ocean at a very long flat

5840.199 --> 5845.96
distance

5842.8 --> 5849.119000000001
did I ask

5845.96 --> 5852.44
them what a bunch a hord of

5849.119 --> 5855.839999999999
ballards why do you ask

5852.44 --> 5857.5199999999995
them the Chinese yeah think they're with

5855.84 --> 5859.679
their space program they're going to

5857.52 --> 5862.96
allow their citizens to just be flat

5859.679 --> 5862.96
earthers are you

5868.84 --> 5873.400000000001
kidding I mean the structural engineers

5871.239 --> 5875.199
will definitely show you the plants and

5873.4 --> 5876.48
then you have like that blueprint and

5875.199 --> 5880.28
it's like yeah

5876.48 --> 5881.28
it's perfectly flat that's exactly what

5880.28 --> 5887.239
it

5881.28 --> 5890.0
is yeah every part pre- designed and

5887.239 --> 5894.638999999999
constructed perfectly

5890.0 --> 5898.8
flat all the parts locking into each

5894.639 --> 5903.119
other designed perfectly flat yep that

5898.8 --> 5903.119000000001
bridge was designed perfectly flat

5905.56 --> 5908.92
people with the big briges

5912.239 --> 5918.04
yeah what I have to so it it is

5915.239 --> 5921.119
dependent on their opinion so if the

5918.04 --> 5922.92
bridge Builders are secretly invested

5921.119 --> 5924.88
they might be like financially in they

5922.92 --> 5927.08
might not even give a [ __ ] it's might

5924.88 --> 5929.400000000001
just be like yeah you want to be this

5927.08 --> 5931.44
big shot Among Us you're going to have

5929.4 --> 5933.96
to reinforce the global religion yeah so

5931.44 --> 5935.799999999999
you better get it right yeah you do it

5933.96 --> 5938.44
you say it's flat one time you

5935.8 --> 5942.2390000000005
immediately use that lose that high

5938.44 --> 5944.638999999999
paying job position you have so you ask

5942.239 --> 5946.839999999999
some Bridge engineer representative

5944.639 --> 5949.32
they'll probably tell you oh yeah oh

5946.84 --> 5952.56
it's built on the sphere it's just too

5949.32 --> 5954.92
big it just seems locally flat but in

5952.56 --> 5958.8
reality it's assembled like a they

5954.92 --> 5962.4800000000005
whatever they'll say who gives a [ __ ]

5958.8 --> 5964.76
it's designed

5962.48 --> 5966.919999999999
flat that's how it's designed the

5964.76 --> 5971.719
blueprints for

5966.92 --> 5975.1990000000005
Bridges like side on view

5971.719 --> 5975.199
flat very

5978.199 --> 5985.4
flat Golden Gate Bridge not talking

5981.48 --> 5985.4
about the Golden Gate Bridge dip

5990.04 --> 5993.04
[ __ ]

5995.119 --> 6000.48
yeah and bridges can be built too to be

5998.159 --> 6001.679
slightly like an arc it's like a

6000.48 --> 6005.5199999999995
strength

6001.679 --> 6007.679
thing yeah Bridges can be built to be

6005.52 --> 6009.8
like an arc because then they have the

6007.679 --> 6013.4800000000005
arc

6009.8 --> 6016.4800000000005
strength yeah if it's just just like

6013.48 --> 6016.48
this

6016.84 --> 6022.04
then it doesn't have that reinforcement

6019.76 --> 6025.119000000001
as if it is in an arc yeah if it's in an

6022.04 --> 6028.76
arc then that makes it stronger it makes

6025.119 --> 6030.5199999999995
it more stable yeah but if it's super

6028.76 --> 6033.56
long there's no point in doing that

6030.52 --> 6035.599
there only Point has only has a point

6033.56 --> 6038.280000000001
within architecture of bridges if it's a

6035.599 --> 6042.119000000001
relatively short bridge when it becomes

6038.28 --> 6043.239
worth it to use that reinforced Arc to

6042.119 --> 6048.5199999999995
strengthen

6043.239 --> 6052.44
it if it's super long like that giant

6048.52 --> 6055.4800000000005
gigantic long road in

6052.44 --> 6060.839999999999
China there's no point it's too long

6055.48 --> 6063.0
they just have support columns every

6060.84 --> 6065.04
distance yeah there's no point in making

6063.0 --> 6068.96
any kind of

6065.04 --> 6070.599
Arc bridges that are shorter can have

6068.96 --> 6073.44
arcs in

6070.599 --> 6075.88
them because of like reinforcement

6073.44 --> 6075.879999999999
because of the

6076.48 --> 6081.36
architecture not saying all of them do

6078.88 --> 6083.2390000000005
but I've seen some of them some bridg

6081.36 --> 6086.759999999999
are slightly

6083.239 --> 6090.4
arked because of the architectural

6086.76 --> 6090.400000000001
advantage of doing

6099.32 --> 6106.599
that Golden Gate Bridge doesn't use

6102.44 --> 6106.598999999999
curve okay fair

6107.32 --> 6111.4
enough I don't even know I'm just

6109.599 --> 6114.88
assuming you're a ball tar just trying

6111.4 --> 6114.879999999999
to get in my way I'm

6129.239 --> 6132.239
sorry

6139.76 --> 6142.76
what

6143.76 --> 6151.92
right level the whole length correct and

6148.92 --> 6151.92
flat

6169.76 --> 6172.76
anyway

6199.679 --> 6202.679

6246.52 --> 6252.88
just this is what I never wanted this to

6250.159 --> 6253.839999999999
happen with dual cosmogonical Society to

6252.88 --> 6257.639
just

6253.84 --> 6262.599
be seeing a bunch of Ballers hoard

6257.639 --> 6262.599
up to find security among their fell

6262.96 --> 6268.0
balarts like that's not what I wanted

6265.32 --> 6270.159
with this Channel at

6268.0 --> 6273.159
all makes me

6270.159 --> 6273.159
very

6275.52 --> 6280.400000000001
tired like you're all just going to

6277.92 --> 6284.96
reinforce each other's

6280.4 --> 6284.96
Ballard that way you're never going to

6289.56 --> 6292.56
learn

6308.199 --> 6311.638999999999
and we're going to convince each

6312.119 --> 6316.88
other to just even to I I don't even

6315.08 --> 6320.08
want to convince

6316.88 --> 6324.04
you like people that go this far with

6320.08 --> 6325.48
their ball arted reasoning are like dead

6324.04 --> 6328.88
they're

6325.48 --> 6331.598999999999
dead you're so [ __ ]

6328.88 --> 6332.8
gone one day Satan is going to come to

6331.599 --> 6336.679
reap your

6332.8 --> 6339.1990000000005
soul yeah that's what that is to

6336.679 --> 6341.719
me it's just not I'm not going to make

6339.199 --> 6341.719
it my

6349.48 --> 6355.759999999999
problem

6352.36 --> 6357.598999999999
like I don't care I you're all just

6355.76 --> 6360.400000000001
continually

6357.599 --> 6362.88
reinforcing your nonsense belief like

6360.4 --> 6366.799999999999
Against All Odds it's in a way a

6362.88 --> 6369.36
testimony to the the dynamic nature of

6366.8 --> 6373.04
human intelligence that people are

6369.36 --> 6376.04
capable of fooling themselves that much

6373.04 --> 6380.719
that long and that

6376.04 --> 6383.56
detailed it is surreal it is the devil I

6380.719 --> 6387.119
mean it's literally Satan in people

6383.56 --> 6390.280000000001
using people's intelligence to persist

6387.119 --> 6391.88
in fooling people's minds about what

6390.28 --> 6394.92
reality

6391.88 --> 6399.679
is that's ball Earth cosmology thanks

6394.92 --> 6402.8
Jesuits thanks for inserting the satanic

6399.679 --> 6405.4800000000005
Antichrist cosmology that you created

6402.8 --> 6408.320000000001
into General society and and calling it

6405.48 --> 6413.429999999999
science you [ __ ]

6408.32 --> 6419.099999999999
scumbags may you be tort Ed for all

6413.43 --> 6419.1
[Music]

6423.37 --> 6426.42
[Music]

6428.08 --> 6435.239
eternity the Jesuits I mean you guys are

6431.0 --> 6439.04
don't give a [ __ ] you probably will yeah

6435.239 --> 6443.879999999999
when you double down on Satan

6439.04 --> 6446.639
cosmology they is going to be a very

6443.88 --> 6449.0
distinct thing that will happen after

6446.639 --> 6452.400000000001
death yeah when you hold onto the

6449.0 --> 6452.4
Reversed world upon

6456.0 --> 6459.679
death doesn't look

6461.04 --> 6465.599
good I don't exactly know what would

6463.52 --> 6468.92
happen even like do you just get sucked

6465.599 --> 6473.400000000001
up by Satan and you

6468.92 --> 6475.84
just instead of reincarnating a demon

6473.4 --> 6479.44
reincarnates not

6475.84 --> 6482.4800000000005
you it could be that if you just that it

6479.44 --> 6484.919999999999
is something like that I mean the more

6482.48 --> 6488.4
ball cosmology ideas have been spread

6484.92 --> 6489.88
the more demonic people have come up the

6488.4 --> 6494.719
higher their

6489.88 --> 6497.52
percentage of demonic Revelation within

6494.719 --> 6498.56
individuals in like every average family

6497.52 --> 6503.4800000000005
has

6498.56 --> 6506.4400000000005
become like has gone up the amount of

6503.48 --> 6508.919999999999
possession has gone

6506.44 --> 6510.48
up like they don't even call it that

6508.92 --> 6512.56
anymore it's not even recognized as a

6510.48 --> 6516.04
thing anymore but you could just see the

6512.56 --> 6518.400000000001
signs and say like yeah the amount of

6516.04 --> 6521.679
possessions that happen

6518.4 --> 6525.28
now of people like even children by

6521.679 --> 6527.56
complete monster demons has definitely

6525.28 --> 6530.8
gone up more and more and

6527.56 --> 6533.4400000000005
that's directly tied into like false

6530.8 --> 6535.56
cosmology belief and like false reality

6533.44 --> 6538.32
belief and look at how far they've taken

6535.56 --> 6541.04
it right on top of the

6538.32 --> 6542.5599999999995
globe how far they flipped everything

6541.04 --> 6545.56
inside

6542.56 --> 6548.56
out more you flip things inside out the

6545.56 --> 6550.639
more vulnerable the people will be that

6548.56 --> 6552.84
actually have a soul that still see

6550.639 --> 6555.2390000000005
things as they really are and then find

6552.84 --> 6557.360000000001
out as their senses awaken as a little

6555.239 --> 6559.199
kid that they're surrounded by people

6557.36 --> 6561.4
that live in an inside world and

6559.199 --> 6564.32
everything is ex exactly the opposite of

6561.4 --> 6567.28
what everybody says it is yeah that's a

6564.32 --> 6568.88
[ __ ] nightmare you're going to panic

6567.28 --> 6572.239
you're going to feel like you just

6568.88 --> 6574.599
awakened in hell as a kid and you will

6572.239 --> 6576.04
become possess because of it you're

6574.599 --> 6579.88
going to

6576.04 --> 6582.76
avenge that Awakening on the world for

6579.88 --> 6585.719
being like that for the world being like

6582.76 --> 6588.96
that that [ __ ] up that [ __ ]

6585.719 --> 6592.84
delusional yeah so what happened with

6588.96 --> 6594.4800000000005
me I'm I am vulnerable to that sort of

6592.84 --> 6597.119000000001
thing I have

6594.48 --> 6601.44
Vengeance yeah my demon is Vengeance and

6597.119 --> 6605.799999999999
it's really [ __ ] got to me it got to

6601.44 --> 6609.919999999999
me very young it's never

6605.8 --> 6611.08
left first I just hide it I pretend it

6609.92 --> 6614.76
doesn't

6611.08 --> 6618.679
exist and then I'm like okay I can

6614.76 --> 6621.0
handle this I'm just going to show

6618.679 --> 6623.28
it that's

6621.0 --> 6625.32
what I do now I'm just like yeah I'm

6623.28 --> 6627.88
just it's part of me now it's never

6625.32 --> 6630.759999999999
going to go away not really I can

6627.88 --> 6632.96
surpress it I can temporarily pretend

6630.76 --> 6636.599
like it doesn't exist and seem like a

6632.96 --> 6638.84
much more stable and overall better

6636.599 --> 6643.119000000001
person but it's not

6638.84 --> 6644.52
real because I have Vengeance in me and

6643.119 --> 6649.04
it's not going to go

6644.52 --> 6650.92
away it's not going to go away until I

6649.04 --> 6654.079
see

6650.92 --> 6656.32
it being fulfilled the Vengeance that I

6654.079 --> 6659.159
wanted when I first woke up in this

6656.32 --> 6661.84
world consciously the very young age and

6659.159 --> 6666.4
realized how [ __ ] up things have

6661.84 --> 6669.0
become and how it is all persisted by

6666.4 --> 6672.36
humans idiotic

6669.0 --> 6675.36
selfishness idiotic selfishness and only

6672.36 --> 6679.0
until that selfishness is like visibly

6675.36 --> 6681.079
tortured and snuffed out on a collective

6679.0 --> 6685.44
massive scale

6681.079 --> 6687.759999999999
will my Vengeance be laid to rest yeah

6685.44 --> 6689.48
I'm cursed with this thing it's going to

6687.76 --> 6694.76
stay

6689.48 --> 6698.36
until until the debt has been

6694.76 --> 6702.320000000001
met the debt in

6698.36 --> 6705.239
pain and not pain of of innocent

6702.32 --> 6708.5199999999995
individuals yeah that only makes it even

6705.239 --> 6711.4
worse for those that actually deserve

6708.52 --> 6713.400000000001
it if there is such a thing they drive

6711.4 --> 6716.04
it up to the point where people can't

6713.4 --> 6719.239
handle it anymore how bad it is in hopes

6716.04 --> 6721.599
that they'll just deflect for

6719.239 --> 6723.879999999999
self-preservation yeah make things so

6721.599 --> 6726.400000000001
bad that you just can't handle it

6723.88 --> 6728.599
anymore and thus you can't persecute

6726.4 --> 6730.96
because you can't even handle thinking

6728.599 --> 6733.079
about it anymore yeah that's where it's

6730.96 --> 6736.0
going to oh you think that's the worst

6733.079 --> 6736.0
of it

6737.04 --> 6745.719
dude you've seen nothing yet

6742.159 --> 6748.679
nothing yeah this kind of ugliness they

6745.719 --> 6751.679
can keep developing and making it worse

6748.679 --> 6754.159
and expressing and systemizing it to the

6751.679 --> 6757.88
point where it's like fractal

6754.159 --> 6759.36
horror they could unroll another 100

6757.88 --> 6763.599
Years of

6759.36 --> 6767.48
nonstop ever increasing slowly worsening

6763.599 --> 6771.84
torture of the mind and soul it will

6767.48 --> 6771.839999999999
never end never

6775.119 --> 6784.28
ever and so the Vengeance in

6779.239 --> 6786.91
me never ends until they end that's the

6784.28 --> 6794.889999999999

here

7626.0 --> 7629.44
yeah apparently Richard yeah I kind

7627.639 --> 7632.679
don't keep track of that [ __ ] it's just

7629.44 --> 7635.839999999999
that I don't want to have anything to do

7632.679 --> 7635.84
with people that do

7635.96 --> 7642.599
that like I don't even do do that with

7639.32 --> 7645.119
people that are like really [ __ ] up

7642.599 --> 7648.159000000001

7645.119 --> 7650.48
little videos about them like I never do

7648.159 --> 7654.32
that have you noticed have you noticed

7650.48 --> 7656.32
that I've never done that not one time

7654.32 --> 7659.119
in my entire YouTube career on this

7656.32 --> 7661.799999999999
channel have I done that not one [ __ ]

7659.119 --> 7665.04
time for good

7661.8 --> 7665.04
reason it's

7666.8 --> 7671.119000000001
disgusting why the hell would you want

7668.679 --> 7671.119
to do

7676.28 --> 7682.96
that I mean unless you're like making a

7678.92 --> 7684.88
good argumentative review of something

7682.96 --> 7687.679
that's one thing right you can make a

7684.88 --> 7690.0
little bit of fun I mean K's treatment

7687.679 --> 7692.1990000000005
but that's just hilarious like that's

7690.0 --> 7694.48
actually really funny and he's literally

7692.199 --> 7697.759999999999
laughing literally laughing I mean

7694.48 --> 7699.119
that's genuinely him thinking it's funny

7697.76 --> 7703.119000000001
not him like

7699.119 --> 7707.119
h no it's him actually laughing that's

7703.119 --> 7710.839999999999
really fun so that's different that's

7707.119 --> 7712.36
just funny you might not get it but if

7710.84 --> 7714.32
you do you're going to think it's funny

7712.36 --> 7717.5199999999995
too

7714.32 --> 7720.4
probably right but just these whiny

7717.52 --> 7722.76
videos to try to catch people on their

7720.4 --> 7726.159
off moments or whatever and then make a

7722.76 --> 7728.1990000000005
summary of it or just give it a shitty

7726.159 --> 7731.679
title like what the [ __ ] is wrong with

7728.199 --> 7731.678999999999
you why would you even do

7741.92 --> 7746.1990000000005
that used to be

7751.599 --> 7759.360000000001
what wow can't say I respect that shanji

7756.159 --> 7762.679

demented at least you're not making a

7779.84 --> 7785.04
big deal out of it I'm sorry but anybody

7782.76 --> 7786.88
that figures out how the Earth is not a

7785.04 --> 7790.32
ball and then goes

7786.88 --> 7794.1990000000005

like hey maybe in a oneone setting we

8148.44 --> 8152.199
could actually have a halfway decent

8150.199 --> 8154.44
conversation but you're looking at a guy

8152.199 --> 8156.44
now who's not not at the top of my game

annoying it'll be fixed tomorrow because

8161.0 --> 8165.48
I will have fish

8162.96 --> 8167.159
oil and probably that'll fix it but I

8165.48 --> 8170.718999999999
just feel like I can't properly

8167.159 --> 8170.719
concentrate as well as I normally

8171.079 --> 8176.96
do and the wind is freaking not helping

8176.96 --> 8183.079
2 hours of freaking akumu virus

8180.44 --> 8184.839999999999
whining double speaking which is like

8274.76 --> 8281.16
anything to do with the scenery the

8281.16 --> 8288.96
leave flatter earth like leave that side

8309.04 --> 8313.92
debate cuz it was actually doing that

8312.24 --> 8317.479

is yeah you're disconnect with reality

[ __ ] head there's no dead end with

8435.16 --> 8442.119999999999
flat earth the earth is measured

8439.08 --> 8443.92
flat Celestial navigation works because

8442.12 --> 8450.52
the Earth is

8443.92 --> 8454.960000000001
flat geometry is based of a flat earth

8450.52 --> 8459.720000000001
flat planes angles to Flat planes angles

8454.96 --> 8463.599999999999
from Flat planes to lights in the

8466.72 --> 8473.88
is in your [ __ ] head you're it's

8468.96 --> 8476.679999999998
called being a [ __ ] and refuses to see

reality cuz it's too inconvenient cuz if

8476.68 --> 8480.64
you have to see reality and they have to

8478.479 --> 8484.16
see how everybody's [ __ ] deranged in

8480.64 --> 8486.96
a [ __ ] disgusting liar as soon as you

8484.16 --> 8489.84

8486.96 --> 8492.039999999999
they have they get all demonic on you

8489.84 --> 8496.880000000001

8492.04 --> 8499.160000000002
that I get it yeah it's called being a

8496.88 --> 8502.759999999998
[ __ ] being a

8499.16 --> 8506.24
coward not being truthful because of

8502.76 --> 8509.880000000001
fear social fear that's what that is

8506.24 --> 8513.319
yeah it's not a dead end the dead end is

8509.88 --> 8517.92
social it's a dead end because you can't

8513.319 --> 8520.439
handle facing the lies of other people

8517.92 --> 8524.08
and those people close by you very close

8520.439 --> 8527.64
to you and when you reveal like the

8524.08 --> 8530.439
truth they will make life hard on you

8527.64 --> 8533.92
that's what people do when you tell them

8530.439 --> 8537.359
things that they don't want to

8533.92 --> 8541.04
accept about you or the entirety of

8537.359 --> 8545.640000000001
reality yeah that's the dead end it's a

8541.04 --> 8548.720000000001
social dead end it's not a mechanical

8545.64 --> 8551.72
reasoning logic dead end absolutely not

8548.72 --> 8554.84
it's absolutely provable that the Earth

8551.72 --> 8554.84
is measured

8566.16 --> 8569.16
flat

8570.12 --> 8574.720000000001
no what working gy bear I have not seen

8572.16 --> 8574.72
that that's

8574.84 --> 8577.84
[ __ ]

8582.359 --> 8589.319
evil why do people hate truth because

8585.2 --> 8591.880000000001
then they have to face the truth

8589.319 --> 8593.88
duper people hate the truth because then

8591.88 --> 8596.72
they have to face it they have to be

8593.88 --> 8598.599999999999
honest about what is real if you have to

8596.72 --> 8600.599999999999
be honest about what's real then things

8598.6 --> 8603.479000000001
that you put away because you didn't

8600.6 --> 8605.08
want to face them are going to be shoved

8603.479 --> 8607.8
in your

8605.08 --> 8610.68
face and the only way to get that away

8607.8 --> 8613.96
from you again to believe of you better

8610.68 --> 8617.960000000001
than you really are you have to kill

8613.96 --> 8622.56
that which forces it back into your view

8617.96 --> 8624.56
and that is the truth destroy the truth

8622.56 --> 8629.08
hide your

8624.56 --> 8629.08
disgraces from yourself

8634.76 --> 8639.319
yeah can't handle the truth so you hide

8637.0 --> 8642.8
from the truth somebody brings out the

8639.319 --> 8645.319
truth well that reminds you of the truth

8642.8 --> 8648.479
that you're hiding from yourself which

8645.319 --> 8649.92
is painful so you destroy the truth that

8648.479 --> 8651.278999999999
reminds you of the truth that you're

8649.92 --> 8654.04
hiding from

8651.279 --> 8659.0
yourself that's how that works that's

8654.04 --> 8659.0
why the truth is so terrible to a liar

8660.55 --> 8665.128999999999
[Music]

8667.24 --> 8673.319
flatter Earth destroy social lives yeah

8670.08 --> 8673.319
well it can

8674.12 --> 8677.68
definitely but it's

8677.92 --> 8684.24
really the point is is that technically

8680.76 --> 8688.0
in a way social lives are a

8684.24 --> 8690.64
lie they are a lie like what kind of a

8688.0 --> 8692.08
social life is a social life when it's

8690.64 --> 8694.92
not based on the

8692.08 --> 8696.479
truth when you're just reinforcing each

8694.92 --> 8699.84
other's

8696.479 --> 8702.08
lies helping each other out to reinforce

8699.84 --> 8705.2
the pretense of being better than you

8702.08 --> 8708.039999999999
really are what kind of a friendship is

8705.2 --> 8709.92
that what kind of a social life is that

8708.04 --> 8714.160000000002
well it's it's the social life that a

8709.92 --> 8714.16
lot of people settle for it's really

8715.64 --> 8722.76
pathetic and I want no part of that

8719.92 --> 8725.08
[ __ ] definitely not going to help

8722.76 --> 8726.64

them face those things that you need to

8737.8 --> 8742.8
face in order to become better than you

8739.96 --> 8745.759999999998

8772.56 --> 8778.119999999999
do why do people like to tell light kids

8776.6 --> 8782.0
Li

8778.12 --> 8782.0
because kids might believe

8786.24 --> 8794.16

lie but that's not what duper is talking

8832.2 --> 8837.240000000002

9172.96 --> 9176.05
got in the

9174.12 --> 9177.92
way and these

9176.05 --> 9180.8
[Music]

9177.92 --> 9183.279
people they are in a very specific way I

9180.8 --> 9185.119999999999
don't know if that's just me or if you

9183.279 --> 9188.720000000001
guys are noticing it

9185.12 --> 9192.640000000001
well like they seem kind of nice at

9188.72 --> 9196.76
first but then they just start to like

9192.64 --> 9198.8
just assume control over you indirectly

9196.76 --> 9201.359
like they're just claiming authority

9198.8 --> 9203.8
over you but not like overtly just

9201.359 --> 9207.08
subtly and they're like suddenly like oh

9203.8 --> 9209.519999999999
now they have become the council that's

9207.08 --> 9212.2
going to rule over me like some [ __ ]

9209.52 --> 9215.359
Communist unelected dictatorship or

9212.2 --> 9217.08
something like that's what it feels like

9215.359 --> 9219.08
they keep doing it they just keep

9217.08 --> 9222.16
Gathering up and it's like oh it's just

9219.08 --> 9226.439
all so natural oh oh it turns oh they're

9222.16 --> 9230.56
all EX flat earthers oh oh they actually

9226.439 --> 9232.84
a bower oh oh and oh they but they know

9230.56 --> 9235.92
so much about me oh and their jobs are

9232.84 --> 9238.2
so good they make so much money and they

9235.92 --> 9241.04
might even support me oh they're so

9238.2 --> 9244.640000000001
above me all of a sudden have you guys

9241.04 --> 9246.479000000001
noticed that like Brianna was absolutely

9244.64 --> 9250.519999999999
like

9246.479 --> 9252.16
that I'm so sick of it I'm so sick of

9250.52 --> 9255.640000000001
these types of

9252.16 --> 9258.279
people who just want to rule over you

9255.64 --> 9261.358999999999
they're dirty disgusting figures that

9258.279 --> 9264.0
just want to get in your way butter you

9261.359 --> 9267.52
up and then they just take you over they

9264.0 --> 9267.52
just try to rule over

9272.64 --> 9276.68
you and I'm sure they're going to try

9275.16 --> 9279.56
again because I

9276.68 --> 9283.56
mean I would not be surprised in the

9279.56 --> 9286.68
least if Rihanna isn't a figure a person

9283.56 --> 9289.0
that's already had like five other

9286.68 --> 9291.52
accounts that try to get in my

9289.0 --> 9293.52
face because they just keep doing it

9291.52 --> 9296.0
over and over

9293.52 --> 9298.560000000001
again like they have longstanding

9296.0 --> 9300.2
projects of like okay I'm going to

9298.56 --> 9303.68
become their best

9300.2 --> 9305.6

9315.68 --> 9320.08
a

9317.439 --> 9323.68
decade since I came out with my flat

9320.08 --> 9328.359
Earth ideas they just knew like this guy

there goes that

9930.12 --> 9934.76
idea oh my God the

9935.479 --> 9941.319
conspiracy that video is funny because

9939.0 --> 9943.279
it's so stupid that you actually thought

9941.319 --> 9945.64
that that was a thing that was like

9943.279 --> 9949.08
scary or outrageous when it it was just

9945.64 --> 9952.119999999999

9957.72 --> 9962.64
was so

9959.92 --> 9965.84
silly like people that could watch it

9962.64 --> 9968.519999999999
could literally watch it and be like uh

9965.84 --> 9972.24
how is this an

9968.52 --> 9975.08
issue he says oh maybe she's a [ __ ]

9972.24 --> 9978.96
with a silly voice obviously then just

9975.08 --> 9981.12
starts chilling and eating on a CA thing

9978.96 --> 9983.438999999998
and then somebody in chat says like oh

9981.12 --> 9987.479000000001
yeah I found video of her she's actually

9983.439 --> 9991.6
person like oh oh okay okay there goes

9987.479 --> 9995.24
that I mean oh my God the

9991.6 --> 9997.08
outrage how dare you Arwin how dare

9995.24 --> 9999.84
you

9997.08 --> 10002.68
casually just suggest that something

9999.84 --> 10005.08
silly might be true don't really care

10002.68 --> 10006.439
about it and then somebody says no way

10005.08 --> 10007.8
here's the evidence against it and I'm

10006.439 --> 10011.359
like oh

10007.8 --> 10011.358999999999
okay oh my

10018.0 --> 10024.88

10028.08 --> 10030.72
fascinating

10031.279 --> 10035.76
one that is a great code indeed seeking

10033.92 --> 10038.279
star welcome by the way that's a great

10035.76 --> 10038.279
entry

10046.68 --> 10052.399
there and I feel really honored because

10050.479 --> 10055.399
I love discussing

10052.399 --> 10058.358999999999
ideas right it's I love

10055.399 --> 10059.88
that and then sometimes I discuss events

10058.359 --> 10063.92
but it's always like

10059.88 --> 10065.479
n i I do like discussing people though

10063.92 --> 10068.72
sometimes

10065.479 --> 10068.72
people can be quite

10068.96 --> 10073.358999999999
fascinating but especially because of

10071.16 --> 10075.8
their

10073.359 --> 10079.479000000001
complications like it's fascinating to

10075.8 --> 10079.479
figure out how somebody

10085.24 --> 10089.08
works which is difficult without a w up

10087.96 --> 10092.08
to

10089.08 --> 10092.08
reinforce

10093.8 --> 10098.319
right

10096.8 --> 10101.358999999999
but I mean that's such a good quote I

10098.319 --> 10101.359
almost want to put it in my

10120.439 --> 10126.52
title right anyway man almost three

10123.8 --> 10131.519999999999
hours again time flies when I'm doing

10126.52 --> 10134.04
these shows today these days I mean not

10131.52 --> 10137.0
today I still remember when it's like oh

10134.04 --> 10139.720000000001
my God have I reached the 2hour mark

10137.0 --> 10142.76
yet and now it's like oh we've gone for

10139.72 --> 10147.199999999999
two and a half hours already oh oh

10142.76 --> 10147.2
okay it's like weekend every day

10148.88 --> 10153.72
now all right so I need a little bit of

10152.04 --> 10155.960000000001
assistance here from the guys that have

10153.72 --> 10159.76
been throughout most to the show like

10155.96 --> 10159.759999999998
what the hell am I going to call

10162.92 --> 10167.960000000001
it talked about refraction

10173.92 --> 10178.76
mostly but there was all this counter

10176.359 --> 10182.279
garbage and it just kept coming and

10178.76 --> 10182.279
eventually I kind of got lost in

10183.2 --> 10189.0
it cuz I'm just not having super

10186.08 --> 10191.76
concentration day

10189.0 --> 10193.479
today so I had trouble maintaining

10191.76 --> 10196.800000000001
oversight it's kind of embarrassing

10193.479 --> 10199.119999999999
really but I mean that's what a lack of

10196.8 --> 10202.519999999999
fish oil can do especially when it's

10199.12 --> 10205.560000000001
like windy weather that that's also a

10202.52 --> 10205.560000000001
detriment to my

10213.64 --> 10216.64
concentration

10224.359 --> 10229.81
maybe I'm just going to call it sweep

10227.279 --> 10235.68
sweeping yeah this is so

10229.81 --> 10238.359
[Music]

10235.68 --> 10240.380000000001
silly I'm going to do it sweeping the

10238.359 --> 10243.41
ball tards under the

10240.38 --> 10243.41
[Music]

10243.64 --> 10246.64
carpet

10246.92 --> 10252.64
right it kind of is because technically

10249.72 --> 10252.64
it doesn't fix

10252.8 --> 10257.358999999999
it what do you

10255.319 --> 10259.119999999999
think oh you were think you were

10257.359 --> 10261.319
thinking in the same direction duper

10259.12 --> 10261.319000000001
that's

10262.8 --> 10268.278999999999
hilarious yeah but no no not cleaning CH

10266.439 --> 10270.279
I I want to say it like this sweeping

10268.279 --> 10273.279
the ballards under the

10270.279 --> 10273.279
carpet

10273.56 --> 10278.359
because

10276.08 --> 10279.88
because of the implications of the

10278.359 --> 10282.68
saying you

10279.88 --> 10284.96
see because by Banning him I don't

10282.68 --> 10287.359
actually fix the problem I just get it

10284.96 --> 10287.358999999999
out of

10287.56 --> 10293.56
sight and I want to emphasize that is

10290.399 --> 10296.599999999999
that just because I end up burning them

10293.56 --> 10299.399
it doesn't mean like oh that means I

10296.6 --> 10302.399000000001
have won I have triumphant in this

10299.399 --> 10305.56
argument no no it's just like ah get out

10302.399 --> 10308.92
of my way you're giving me a damn

10305.56 --> 10308.92
headache it's your

10311.96 --> 10317.0
barded so I'm kind of sweeping it under

10314.68 --> 10318.68
the under the carpet like dust like not

10317.0 --> 10321.84
being a very good cleaner but at least

10318.68 --> 10323.439
it looks a bit cleaner right but they're

10321.84 --> 10325.239
going to come underneath the carpet

10323.439 --> 10327.68
again it's going to fall off it's going

10325.239 --> 10330.96
to get Dusty again ball Tarts all over

10327.68 --> 10333.720000000001
the place I'm sure of it yeah you delete

10330.96 --> 10335.839999999998
it they just make another account and

10333.72 --> 10337.88
then they sneak back back in or they

10335.84 --> 10340.319
start complaining with somebody else

10337.88 --> 10344.479
that then just makes anti rwin videos or

10340.319 --> 10344.479
something right it never really

10348.64 --> 10353.199999999999
stops you think it's a good title okay

10351.279 --> 10355.6
thanks duper it it's the best I could do

10353.2 --> 10355.6
for the

10360.8 --> 10366.438999999998
circumstance they ever ask a glow with

10363.0 --> 10366.439
the carpet your house

10393.359 --> 10398.04
oh

10394.96 --> 10400.64
all right but I mean Akuma virus will be

10398.04 --> 10400.640000000001
back I

10402.76 --> 10407.68
just I wish there was just he could have

10405.279 --> 10409.76
a shock colar or something that it once

10407.68 --> 10412.64
he finally gets over excited and all

10409.76 --> 10416.279
that [ __ ] he won't stop that could just

10412.64 --> 10419.76
just stop stop stop calm down shut up

10416.279 --> 10421.4
sit down shut up don't move don't think

10419.76 --> 10423.359
shut

10421.4 --> 10426.399
[Music]

10423.359 --> 10427.76
up because he just won't do it he can't

10426.399 --> 10430.84
help

10427.76 --> 10433.92
himself like he insists on just being

10430.84 --> 10436.12
kicked out through his behavior and he

10433.92 --> 10438.359
does that every time this happens it's

10436.12 --> 10441.2
very annoying I like having him around

10438.359 --> 10445.479000000001
in general but when he gets like this is

10441.2 --> 10445.479000000001
just oh my God it's so

10447.04 --> 10453.279
annoying he's only here to learn yeah

10450.16 --> 10456.399
well sometimes you need a little bit

10453.279 --> 10459.16
more hard-handed form of Education

10456.399 --> 10459.16
seeking star

10460.82 --> 10464.298999999999
[Music]

10471.76 --> 10475.960000000001
water no but it's mostly about dude

10474.8 --> 10478.479
stand

10475.96 --> 10482.438999999998
down like you're now going into

10478.479 --> 10484.88
disruption mode stand down stop wind it

10482.439 --> 10487.64
down and I'm saying it to him and he

10484.88 --> 10487.64
just won't do

10487.68 --> 10494.12
it like he'll literally keep saying just

10490.92 --> 10496.68
ask just ask no it's not about I'm going

10494.12 --> 10499.76
to adapt to how you want it you need to

10496.68 --> 10503.08
shut up like you need to understand that

10499.76 --> 10505.479
that's in your best interest to do

10503.08 --> 10509.279
that and he

10505.479 --> 10512.479
won't he won't stop and so I had to kick

10509.279 --> 10514.560000000001
him even though I didn't want to cuz now

10512.479 --> 10518.72
the whole chat is deleted again and we

10514.56 --> 10520.68
had interesting conversation this just

10518.72 --> 10523.64
it's such a waste every

10520.68 --> 10526.720000000001
time but if I don't kick him out he'll

10523.64 --> 10530.68
literally spam my chat to no end he will

10526.72 --> 10530.679999999998
just say like all this bald arted

10531.04 --> 10537.560000000001
nonsense and it will ruin the whole show

10534.8 --> 10537.56
it's happened

10538.0 --> 10543.2
before this is not like a new guy I mean

10541.04 --> 10546.6
I known a kumu virus for like half a

10543.2 --> 10550.76
decade every time he gets like this you

10546.6 --> 10550.76
have to kick him out because he won't

10552.92 --> 10559.8
stop the chat will still be on the

10555.12 --> 10559.800000000001
stream yes but it's not the

10559.88 --> 10567.039999999999
same because the YouTube live chat is

10563.399 --> 10571.0
much easier to read Pala

10567.04 --> 10574.720000000001
te like it is on camera it's in the

10571.0 --> 10576.88
video itself as like as real evidence

10574.72 --> 10580.399
like it's really there as evidence the

10576.88 --> 10583.679999999998
text on my chat is there as evidence

10580.399 --> 10587.72
because the the chat from YouTube can be

10583.68 --> 10589.279
messed with it can be made unavailable

10587.72 --> 10591.84
people can

10589.279 --> 10594.399000000001
retroactively or after the fact delete

10591.84 --> 10597.439
their messages themselves which is very

10594.399 --> 10599.199999999999
annoying right so it can be messed with

10597.439 --> 10601.0
and so it could seem like I'm just

10599.2 --> 10603.76
talking to people and they are not even

10601.0 --> 10604.68
there that's why I have the text on

10603.76 --> 10606.800000000001
screen

10604.68 --> 10608.68
to make it CLE that I am actually

10606.8 --> 10612.039999999999
talking to those

10608.68 --> 10614.6
people but for the actual trying to

10612.04 --> 10618.439
follow the conversation and reading the

10614.6 --> 10620.52
chat the YouTube chat is way more

10618.439 --> 10623.800000000001
proficient for

10620.52 --> 10625.6
that like it's way better to read easier

10623.8 --> 10627.16
to

10625.6 --> 10630.92
read

10627.16 --> 10635.84
so that's why I'm annoyed that's why I I

10630.92 --> 10638.68
wish that YouTube would just like

10635.84 --> 10642.0
reconfigure the functions of the timeout

10638.68 --> 10645.04
and the Banning as to not

10642.0 --> 10646.52
retroactively delete everything that was

10645.04 --> 10650.640000000001
said in the

10646.52 --> 10650.640000000001
chat like stop

10652.6 --> 10660.439
that if anything make a separate form of

10656.04 --> 10660.439
ban that says ban and delete all

10662.359 --> 10667.880000000001
messages as a SE separate

10665.0 --> 10670.08
function and then have timeout which

10667.88 --> 10673.759999999998
will not have delete all messages

10670.08 --> 10676.56
definitely not and ban which won't have

10673.76 --> 10679.76
delete all messages

10676.56 --> 10681.278999999999
either right and then if you're like oh

10679.76 --> 10684.16
wow we had a lot of [ __ ] I watch just

10681.279 --> 10686.0
want to delete that then you do just

10684.16 --> 10688.279
delete all

10686.0 --> 10690.84
messages right you could even have like

10688.279 --> 10692.640000000001
a a a moderator function that just says

10690.84 --> 10695.359
delete all messages that doesn't even

10692.64 --> 10698.16
time you out or back you it's just a

10695.359 --> 10701.319
separate button just like go to the

10698.16 --> 10703.8
thing you hover over the

10701.319 --> 10707.84
options right and then it just says

10703.8 --> 10709.8
delete all messages or timeout ban but

10707.84 --> 10712.84
when you use timeout and ban they don't

10709.8 --> 10718.399
delete all the messages PR default I

10712.84 --> 10721.6
mean do that it will greatly improve the

10718.399 --> 10721.599999999999
YouTube chat in my

10722.92 --> 10725.92
opinion

10728.2 --> 10732.52
you can't rewatch my live chats after

10730.56 --> 10735.56
yeah but that's only in the in the first

10732.52 --> 10738.84
like few hours Palpatine if you like

10735.56 --> 10741.72
come back after at least four hours you

10738.84 --> 10742.8
will be able to the watch the the live

10741.72 --> 10745.64
chat

10742.8 --> 10748.56
again it's just it takes some time to

10745.64 --> 10752.84
process for YouTube before it becomes

10748.56 --> 10755.84
available again that's just how it

10752.84 --> 10755.84
works

10757.41 --> 10761.96
[Music]

10759.12 --> 10764.08
right so it's past five here so I'm

10761.96 --> 10768.88
going to round

10764.08 --> 10768.88
out before it gets completely dark out

10776.0 --> 10781.8
there still don't get what was up with

10778.68 --> 10781.800000000001
steamy traveler

10782.84 --> 10788.399
there

10785.64 --> 10790.399
maybe yeah maybe he recognized it quick

10788.399 --> 10793.399
that he was in like an oppositionally

10790.399 --> 10795.72
defiant mood or

10793.399 --> 10797.92
something and he recognized and then

10795.72 --> 10797.92
just

10798.88 --> 10804.399
left but I mean I wasn't like even

10802.239 --> 10807.439
intending to like attack him or anything

10804.399 --> 10809.8
I just like could you please elaborate

10807.439 --> 10812.76
on that like you're like

10809.8 --> 10818.479
throwing basically a spanner in the

10812.76 --> 10818.479
works and then not providing the

10825.84 --> 10832.6
information but anyway he'll be back

10828.8 --> 10832.599999999999
things are I'm proud they're probably

10837.64 --> 10842.119999999999
fine right but yeah just for future

10840.56 --> 10845.278999999999
reference you want to hang around with

10842.12 --> 10848.479000000001
me if you have anti rwin videos on your

10845.279 --> 10848.479000000001
channel you will be

10851.76 --> 10857.279
banned yeah I can't believe I hadn't

10854.88 --> 10860.358999999999
spotted it thank you duper for doing the

10857.279 --> 10860.359
investigations on

10862.319 --> 10867.92
that because I don't really check out

10864.88 --> 10870.56
any Channel that I talk with I just know

10867.92 --> 10872.56
that Brianna Johnson has had like a lot

10870.56 --> 10874.278999999999
of comments and a lot of them were kind

10872.56 --> 10876.119999999999
of negative too

10874.279 --> 10880.640000000001
that she made comments in my comment

10876.12 --> 10883.479000000001
section on my videos and I was like I

10880.64 --> 10885.88
don't know if I really like

10883.479 --> 10888.8
you but I didn't even know she had like

10885.88 --> 10891.399
an anti- Arwin video that's just

10888.8 --> 10893.199999999999
ridiculous just like George Sanford like

10891.399 --> 10895.358999999999
what the [ __ ] are you doing why are you

10893.2 --> 10898.640000000001
hang around here when you have weird

10895.359 --> 10901.84
anti rwi titled

10898.64 --> 10905.64
videos like there's something weird with

10901.84 --> 10905.64
you that's not normal

10907.52 --> 10912.0
anyway thanks everyone for coming I hope

10910.2 --> 10915.0
you like like this show was kind of

10912.0 --> 10915.0
Rowdy and all

10916.76 --> 10920.72
that still interesting

10921.2 --> 10927.16
though oh refraction situation is very

10925.04 --> 10930.84
complicated and worth going through

10927.16 --> 10932.68
several times like I it took me several

10930.84 --> 10937.52
times going through that subject like at

10932.68 --> 10942.92
fed just to really start to understand

10937.52 --> 10946.84
it because Optics is very complicated it

10942.92 --> 10946.84
really is compared to

10947.92 --> 10953.84
most like other physics subjects Optics

10951.04 --> 10955.720000000001
is actually really complicated I find it

10953.84 --> 10958.239
personally very

10955.72 --> 10960.239
complicated and I'm glad that I already

10958.239 --> 10962.439
know all these things about it and that

10960.239 --> 10965.56
I they stick to memory but still it is

10962.439 --> 10965.56
very complicated

10966.96 --> 10971.72
right so

10969.2 --> 10974.08
anyway if you like the show then please

10971.72 --> 10976.358999999999
