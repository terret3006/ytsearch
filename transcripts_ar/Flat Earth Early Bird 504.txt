180.98 --> 187.48899999999998
sphere and all these details in order

182.93 --> 189.14000000000001
for any of it to even work it's not my

187.489 --> 192.37

189.14 --> 192.36999999999998
Julia Pavan

observer one yeah good to see you all

242.7 --> 249.06
yeah so

255.1 --> 258.269
[Music]

264.1 --> 268.54
I went to bed really early yesterday

266.26 --> 272.78999999999996
like incredibly early for my doing

268.54 --> 275.28000000000003
because I thought I needed to sleep and

272.79 --> 278.71000000000004
yeah that was pretty good

275.28 --> 282.25
but at the same time I'm just noticing

278.71 --> 284.26
that my body is having some trend

282.25 --> 286.0
yeah it's spring transition problem so I

284.26 --> 288.73
think it probably has something to do

286.0 --> 291.37
with with all the pollen in the air now

288.73 --> 293.41
I'm not I don't really have a hay fever

291.37 --> 302.35
in a classical sense but I do usually

293.41 --> 307.24
notice some like responses to it and in

302.35 --> 310.8
my case it seems to be like yeah my tear

307.24 --> 314.65000000000003
duct on one side has kind of become

310.8 --> 318.33
inflammation of thing happens more often

314.65 --> 321.25
you know but it is kind of annoying

318.33 --> 325.57
although I don't know it almost seems to

321.25 --> 329.91
be you have retreating already so it's

325.57 --> 329.90999999999997
just a minor inconvenience nothing real

337.639 --> 340.639
yeah

341.03 --> 346.88899999999995
yes Missouri bear I'm pretty sure that

344.25 --> 349.44
just the airlines have been fitted with

346.889 --> 353.94
these it might even literally be like a

349.44 --> 355.65
part of their fuel in a way or all one

353.94 --> 358.59
could argue that they don't really have

355.65 --> 363.53999999999996
much fuel and so they fill it up with

358.59 --> 366.21
the spray stuff instead I don't know but

363.54 --> 370.95000000000005
yeah nobody has to know about it not

366.21 --> 375.89
really it's like the spraying system

370.95 --> 375.89
simply tags along the commercial airline

375.95 --> 380.82
program that's pretty much how they I

378.93 --> 383.04
think they do they're doing it most of

380.82 --> 386.19
it although I have heard that there are

383.04 --> 387.99
special like super high altitude planes

386.19 --> 390.229
that are definitely not commercial

387.99 --> 393.479
airliners that you also spray at times

390.229 --> 397.40999999999997
so it's not just exclusively the regular

393.479 --> 400.03999999999996
airliners that do this from everything

397.41 --> 400.04
I've learned so far

406.39 --> 409.39
right

415.669 --> 421.49899999999997
start is there a problem

417.719 --> 424.439
Digital prison do I need to be Oh caller

421.499 --> 426.619
II and gay and have like a new fancy hat

424.439 --> 429.92900000000003
every day

426.619 --> 433.309
maybe I just have white shirt or black

429.929 --> 437.81899999999996
shirts because I like wearing black I

433.309 --> 438.53900000000004
think it's the only color that really

437.819 --> 440.72900000000004
suits me

438.539 --> 442.769
I've learned all other colors and in

440.729 --> 445.469
retrospect I just didn't like it on me

442.769 --> 450.269
at all it emphasized the wrong qualities

445.469 --> 451.829
I don't want it so I wear black it's a

450.269 --> 455.969
great likelihood I'm always going to be

451.829 --> 458.939
wearing black till I die there may be

455.969 --> 463.55899999999997
exceptions you know I may even have look

458.939 --> 468.389
I do at times if it if it's like if it

463.559 --> 471.17900000000003
works I can wear uniforms like I don't

468.389 --> 473.999
have problems like wearing business

471.179 --> 475.529
uniforms or work uniforms or any of that

473.999 --> 477.71900000000005
it's just that when I wear my own

475.529 --> 480.029
clothes I wear black and this is just

477.719 --> 488.639
always like that it has been like that

480.029 --> 490.939
for 20 years or well for I guess 16

488.639 --> 490.939
years

493.51 --> 503.43
so yeah that's just the way it is well

499.87 --> 509.68
I'm sorry that you don't like it 24/7

503.43 --> 511.81
365 you know sometimes I might wear a

509.68 --> 522.07
white shirt I have a white shirt I've

511.81 --> 523.84
worn it I just don't feel like it on the

522.07 --> 526.9000000000001
other hand you know with this hot

523.84 --> 534.19
weather maybe I just should maybe I

526.9 --> 538.8
should just do it I've no particular

534.19 --> 542.62
problem wearing white it's just that it

538.8 --> 544.93
makes me feel so different you know

542.62 --> 548.86
there is this thing about always wearing

544.93 --> 550.66
black and that is that when you first

548.86 --> 552.37
come somewhere for the first time

550.66 --> 554.14
nobody's ever seen you yeah you draw

552.37 --> 557.14
attention but you know when you just

554.14 --> 559.12
look at it every single time you don't

557.14 --> 561.37
draw a lot of attention no if you're

559.12 --> 562.93
gonna wear color E stuff all the time or

561.37 --> 565.36
change clothes that's gonna draw

562.93 --> 569.13
attention I don't like that I don't

565.36 --> 569.13
really like that too much

578.69 --> 586.639
or at least yeah I don't know maybe I I

584.449 --> 591.68
would like it I'm just not used to it

586.639 --> 594.1
Oh Chet frozen again thanks for

591.68 --> 594.0999999999999
reminding me

604.09 --> 606.8100000000001
yeah

618.43 --> 622.81
thank you light energy I appreciate that

624.49 --> 631.7
right habits are tough to break and the

628.49 --> 636.38
thing is I don't have any reason to

631.7 --> 640.97
break it at this time for real

636.38 --> 642.8
like social wise - it's because yeah I

640.97 --> 644.51
fully admit it if I'm gonna have a

642.8 --> 646.8199999999999
girlfriend and it's gonna be of a

644.51 --> 649.459
certain type it's a great likelihood I

646.82 --> 651.86
will absolutely be their dress-up puppet

649.459 --> 656.0889999999999
up to a certain degree you know I'm not

651.86 --> 658.3100000000001
gonna humiliate myself but I was like

656.089 --> 661.3290000000001
that with my ex - I would always wear

658.31 --> 667.1899999999999
default black stuff but she was very

661.329 --> 669.8599999999999
very dressed up and yes sometimes I

667.19 --> 672.98
would then go with that and it would be

669.86 --> 678.74
a lot of fun but on my own I'm not gonna

672.98 --> 679.94
do that just not just no yeah I did have

678.74 --> 682.279
a super chat by the way thank you for

679.94 --> 686.12
inviting me I almost forgot Guns of

682.279 --> 688.399
Navarone rmp said 15 Canadian dollars

686.12 --> 692.8100000000001
wow that's quite a lot I will never

688.399 --> 697.61
concede the idea 5g is safe deniers are

692.81 --> 699.649
trolls the threat is real yeah thank you

697.61 --> 705.0500000000001
I appreciate that

699.649 --> 708.16
that sentiment thing is though I don't

705.05 --> 714.9799999999999
know if it really can be stopped because

708.16 --> 718.85
it's kind of like being forced like the

714.98 --> 721.01
the veil of democracy and of the

718.85 --> 724.88
people's will that are rejecting it

721.01 --> 727.22
unless this concept that like the people

724.88 --> 732.11
actually have a say in any sort of way

727.22 --> 735.6990000000001
is starting to drop and it's not gonna

732.11 --> 737.99
go back it's gonna drop and people

735.699 --> 740.68
everywhere are gonna figure out that

737.99 --> 743.839
they literally are ruled by a covert

740.68 --> 748.0999999999999
dictatorship under the guise of pure

743.839 --> 750.23
false lie based democracy no to say

748.1 --> 751.7900000000001
whatsoever and politicians in the last

750.23 --> 756.23
moment doing it anyway

751.79 --> 758.81
despite all the consequences that [ __ ]

756.23 --> 760.61
well the Netherlands has already seen

758.81 --> 764.05
that kind of thing happened for like 10

760.61 --> 769.67
years it's been absolutely revolting but

764.05 --> 775.5799999999999
yeah that's gonna be normal

769.67 --> 777.0799999999999
it's not even gonna be like dangerous or

775.58 --> 779.0600000000001
well not going to be perceived to be

777.08 --> 781.34
dangerous it's just things are just

779.06 --> 783.53
gonna be done and I think that the 5g in

781.34 --> 786.32
England is just one of those things too

783.53 --> 788.18
and I guess that is part of the reason

786.32 --> 790.5500000000001
why is like why are you gonna rebel

788.18 --> 792.02
against it if technically you know you

790.55 --> 798.43
won't be able to do anything about it

792.02 --> 798.43
well maybe because I choose to

800.32 --> 809.0600000000001
understand that's a reference to the

805.61 --> 814.58
matrix 3 because I choose to

809.06 --> 816.9799999999999
I refuse even though I know it's

814.58 --> 823.85
probably not gonna work out because I

816.98 --> 826.4200000000001
just I cannot let myself accept it do

823.85 --> 826.4200000000001
you understand

827.69 --> 832.72
they just can't do it this the

830.42 --> 838.18
consequences are too fast to

832.72 --> 846.44
irreversible for me to just accept it I

838.18 --> 848.4499999999999
just can I I don't know I I'd rather

846.44 --> 853.1300000000001
risk breaking it all down it sounds

848.45 --> 854.96
incredibly anarchists of me but yes it's

853.13 --> 856.97
like I want these telephone companies I

854.96 --> 861.4300000000001
want them all to be held accountable for

856.97 --> 865.07
what they're doing I want this

861.43 --> 868.67
conspiracy protection of this [ __ ] to

865.07 --> 871.7900000000001
stop for real and it's a big problem

868.67 --> 875.8399999999999
because it's just another player in the

871.79 --> 879.68
book it's all tied in it's the the

875.84 --> 882.38
political system the judicial system the

879.68 --> 885.02
medical system the main street that

882.38 --> 887.78
they're all covering all covering for

885.02 --> 890.74
this this thing this technology that is

887.78 --> 894.74
there for for two things

890.74 --> 898.16
mind control right information based

894.74 --> 900.17
mind control maybe even literal directly

898.16 --> 904.04
emotional influences because of the

900.17 --> 910.87
radiation the second is the slow kill or

904.04 --> 916.04
fast kill anyone they want and that's

910.87 --> 918.26
completely unacceptable and it's just

916.04 --> 920.99
this one freaking technology that can

918.26 --> 923.81
already provide all of that it already

920.99 --> 927.8
does all of that it's just one freaking

923.81 --> 929.9599999999999
little thing that's I can't even think

927.8 --> 932.42
of on the top of my head what else is

929.96 --> 934.34
even out there that this already it's

932.42 --> 938.06
still kept in the shadows it's probably

934.34 --> 943.0400000000001
even surpasses that it does exist it's

938.06 --> 944.81
just like is it gonna be applied well 5g

943.04 --> 947.5999999999999
and everything that comes with it it is

944.81 --> 952.31
being applied it is just being initiated

947.6 --> 957.63
just like that and yeah what can you do

952.31 --> 960.5999999999999
revolt burn it all down series it sounds

957.63 --> 964.56
yeah it sounds bad I don't know on the

960.6 --> 968.25
other response it's either sit down you

964.56 --> 970.079
shut up you deal with all the dead bucks

968.25 --> 972.779
that are gonna be laying around you deal

970.079 --> 974.779
with the daily headaches spell maybe you

972.779 --> 977.16
want and other people you know we'll

974.779 --> 979.56
family members will they will have

977.16 --> 980.9699999999999
headaches they will have sudden nausea

979.56 --> 983.459
that came out of nothing that's not

980.97 --> 986.3100000000001
gonna go away the doctor can get it away

983.459 --> 989.25
medicine don't help that just gonna sit

986.31 --> 994.709
back and watch things die around you

989.25 --> 996.66
slowly and with agony yeah because the

994.709 --> 1004.6899999999999
death it creates it's not a it's not a

996.66 --> 1009.29
blissful calm that no it's painful okay

1004.69 --> 1014.7090000000001
slow painful it's drag it's gonna drag

1009.29 --> 1016.759
it's not ended yeah or you could say

1014.709 --> 1021.05
screw all of it

1016.759 --> 1023.63
you know I'm ready to be picked up by a

1021.05 --> 1027.6689999999999
SWAT team because I'm not taking this

1023.63 --> 1027.669
[ __ ] anymore and I'm gonna burn it down

1027.819 --> 1035.99
and yeah if I don't know like one out of

1032.689 --> 1038.8700000000001
a thousand do that then yeah it's gonna

1035.99 --> 1040.669
be a ruckus and oh look at the why are

1038.87 --> 1044.059
they going crazy you know then they're

1040.669 --> 1047.0
gone again but yeah maybe if one out of

1044.059 --> 1049.7
ten does it then suddenly the whole

1047.0 --> 1052.72
thing changes because then these towers

1049.7 --> 1056.15
will be burned down and then the

1052.72 --> 1058.94
installers won't be able to repair it

1056.15 --> 1065.3600000000001
again and then there will be police

1058.94 --> 1069.23
lines with shields trying to make the

1065.36 --> 1071.87
people stop in some way because they

1069.23 --> 1075.47
will literally push it they will keep on

1071.87 --> 1078.28
going until you are all dead do you

1075.47 --> 1078.28
understand

1090.2 --> 1093.68
it's your last chance

1103.01 --> 1109.98
yeah and with dead I don't just mean all

1107.7 --> 1111.93
corpses everywhere no there will be some

1109.98 --> 1115.41
corpses and the others will simply be

1111.93 --> 1117.69
Hollow and spending probably the rest of

1115.41 --> 1121.2
your life just trying to forget that it

1117.69 --> 1123.9
all happened because they chose to be

1121.2 --> 1126.72
helpless they chose to ignore it they

1123.9 --> 1128.52
chose to let people suffer and die and

1126.72 --> 1130.77
not even tell them what's causing it

1128.52 --> 1133.02
because they could figure it out and

1130.77 --> 1134.58
then you're gonna have to deal with that

1133.02 --> 1137.7
the rest of your life you're just gonna

1134.58 --> 1139.53
be that guy yeah yeah our government is

1137.7 --> 1143.15
[ __ ] maniacal I can't even talk about

1139.53 --> 1147.99
it anymore but yeah they killed us and

1143.15 --> 1149.73
yeah and I didn't know what to do nobody

1147.99 --> 1153.27
did anything now how could you do

1149.73 --> 1160.08
anything yeah yeah yeah good luck that's

1153.27 --> 1162.45
the way it's gonna go for many of you

1160.08 --> 1167.1599999999999
unless there's enough momentum and you

1162.45 --> 1169.8600000000001
actually stop it actually stop it it's

1167.16 --> 1172.92
gonna get rough it's gonna get very

1169.86 --> 1177.51
rough that might go to civil war levels

1172.92 --> 1179.46
rough might I don't know if it will all

1177.51 --> 1183.12
depends on how much momentum is there

1179.46 --> 1185.3700000000001
and I'm pretty sure there are parties

1183.12 --> 1188.79
even in politics over in England that

1185.37 --> 1190.83
are very much against this they just

1188.79 --> 1195.09
don't have the grip because they got the

1190.83 --> 1200.75
entire media system against them so

1195.09 --> 1207.4499999999998
we'll see where that goes where we all

1200.75 --> 1209.79
the dead from 4G law no but yeah the

1207.45 --> 1213.38
influence is absolutely palpable since

1209.79 --> 1216.6599999999999
4G was introduced roughly the amount of

1213.38 --> 1220.3500000000001
brain cancer alone as skyrocketed to

1216.66 --> 1222.21
epic levels and seen in history so yeah

1220.35 --> 1228.32
that's one little detail about it you

1222.21 --> 1232.65
know and with five years yeah thing is

1228.32 --> 1234.4199999999998
with 4G it's it's it's damaging it's

1232.65 --> 1235.8000000000002
much slower so it's more dependent on

1234.42 --> 1237.0900000000001
idiots just constantly

1235.8 --> 1238.8799999999999
walking hours and hours with the

1237.09 --> 1241.56
cellphone right next to the head right

1238.88 --> 1244.1100000000001
if you do that what 5g is gonna be over

1241.56 --> 1247.53
a lot quicker though you know that's why

1244.11 --> 1253.6799999999998
the phones have instructions on them

1247.53 --> 1255.93
do not use enclosure proxy keep your

1253.68 --> 1258.78
mobile like you have to keep it within

1255.93 --> 1260.22
what is it to feed our meter or

1258.78 --> 1263.34
something you have to keep it away it's

1260.22 --> 1267.99
on the [ __ ] instructions of your

1263.34 --> 1270.03
mobile phone okay why do you think that

1267.99 --> 1275.34
that's not fine no that's for cheese on

1270.03 --> 1291.0
the instructions okay so no consequences

1275.34 --> 1292.35
just right hmm that's interesting

1291.0 --> 1295.46
unicorn Slayer

1292.35 --> 1297.87
yeah fm could kill you quicker than 5g

1295.46 --> 1300.15
right yeah if you're gonna sit right

1297.87 --> 1303.3799999999999
next to the radio tower that transmits

1300.15 --> 1308.8500000000001
this day-in day-out yeah absolutely

1303.38 --> 1311.5500000000002
absolutely but the thing about those

1308.85 --> 1313.83
that technology still is that it is just

1311.55 --> 1316.95
a very far ranging tower so you just

1313.83 --> 1320.73
need one tower the thing is it's all

1316.95 --> 1324.72
about applying without the least damage

1320.73 --> 1330.21
and I think that even the 4G despite all

1324.72 --> 1332.49
the damaging effects is still doable to

1330.21 --> 1334.95
a certain degree because you can just

1332.49 --> 1336.78
have a freaking tower somewhere yeah it

1334.95 --> 1338.52
will have a death zone around it it

1336.78 --> 1341.85
should definitely be clear like okay I

1338.52 --> 1345.69
got one of those towers then there

1341.85 --> 1349.23
should be like at least one or two miles

1345.69 --> 1351.3600000000001
of space surrounding and where that

1349.23 --> 1355.59
should kind of be like a warning zone

1351.36 --> 1358.79
like you can't live there without risk

1355.59 --> 1362.37
and it has to be like very well-known

1358.79 --> 1365.79
right and then yeah still then it's kind

1362.37 --> 1368.1299999999999
of doable but if there's gonna be 5g

1365.79 --> 1368.86
transmitters everywhere then it's gonna

1368.13 --> 1371.3500000000001
be

1368.86 --> 1376.12
similar to living right next to one of

1371.35 --> 1378.4289999999999
those 4G transmitters it's just gonna be

1376.12 --> 1379.9289999999999
almost the same it's slightly different

1378.429 --> 1382.51
but it is still gonna have that

1379.929 --> 1386.169
influence and then you don't have a

1382.51 --> 1390.25
choice to not live right next to the

1386.169 --> 1392.7990000000002
radio tower yeah it's gonna be in the

1390.25 --> 1395.95
street Gardner's now oh wait there's no

1392.799 --> 1401.1
home that's far away enough oh oh how

1395.95 --> 1401.1000000000001
bad too bad yeah

1410.63 --> 1413.63
right

1418.01 --> 1423.89
right well look you don't have to

1420.62 --> 1426.1399999999999
literally become not everybody get sick

1423.89 --> 1428.63
of it and die so I was very clear about

1426.14 --> 1433.01
that right if you let it all happen not

1428.63 --> 1437.5900000000001
everybody's gonna die but some will oh

1433.01 --> 1440.39
yeah oh yeah they will slowly painfully

1437.59 --> 1441.9189999999999
but not everyone there's people that are

1440.39 --> 1444.3200000000002
kind of like it

1441.919 --> 1447.3090000000002
they survive it although you don't know

1444.32 --> 1451.3899999999999
what the longest term consequences are

1447.309 --> 1456.049
it's a great likelihood that just

1451.39 --> 1458.419
sitting in that is gonna cut a severe

1456.049 --> 1461.4189999999999
chunk of your lifespan just like that

1458.419 --> 1463.5200000000002
because your cells are all uniformly

1461.419 --> 1470.8700000000001
aging more rapidly because of the stress

1463.52 --> 1473.929
that kind of [ __ ] so yeah you might not

1470.87 --> 1478.4799999999998
get sick literally but that's usually a

1473.929 --> 1481.4
sign that your body is not processing it

1478.48 --> 1483.46
cuz sickness is this is this is a

1481.4 --> 1486.3200000000002
response if you get sick that means

1483.46 --> 1488.15
there's an issue in your body that is

1486.32 --> 1489.8899999999999
getting resolved that is getting a

1488.15 --> 1493.13
response that is getting a fixed

1489.89 --> 1495.3500000000001
procedure see you know somehow the virus

1493.13 --> 1500.419
is coming right they fix things they

1495.35 --> 1504.23
clean up the dead tissue and detoxify

1500.419 --> 1506.0300000000002
that's what they're supposed to do so if

1504.23 --> 1508.76
you don't have a sick response that

1506.03 --> 1510.02
means that it's not clicking that

1508.76 --> 1513.65
doesn't mean you're not getting the

1510.02 --> 1516.02
damage though it just means that there's

1513.65 --> 1518.44
no cleaner procedure being triggered

1516.02 --> 1518.44
pretty much

1521.71 --> 1527.33
yeah truth of coming you need to have a

1524.15 --> 1529.64
little patience because yeah we I'm

1527.33 --> 1531.86
having a quite an elaborate conversation

1529.64 --> 1533.63
here that there's some specific thing

1531.86 --> 1535.9699999999998
you want me to address then you need to

1533.63 --> 1539.8000000000002
mention my name in it and not just oh

1535.97 --> 1539.8
you're not gonna answer the question I

1544.21 --> 1547.78
don't know where you are

1555.54 --> 1562.47
all right the Sun and the moon patterns

1558.48 --> 1565.6200000000001
why what forces it forces what force

1562.47 --> 1568.3500000000001
it's a manifestation they manifest in

1565.62 --> 1570.33
these relations as I have probably has

1568.35 --> 1576.0
to do with electromagnetic it's really a

1570.33 --> 1578.28
field induced effect this is yeah beyond

1576.0 --> 1580.77
my current understanding but I could

1578.28 --> 1584.1
conceptually presupposition we model it

1580.77 --> 1587.1299999999999
out like how it could be a connection I

1584.1 --> 1589.4599999999998
have suspicions that it is manifesting

1587.13 --> 1594.0900000000001
through electrical energy in some way

1589.46 --> 1597.3600000000001
but as to why what forces it how the

1594.09 --> 1600.72
hell would I know I don't even know how

1597.36 --> 1604.28
they manifest yet I just know they're

1600.72 --> 1607.2
lights I've managed to be able to dispel

1604.28 --> 1609.27
the illusion that they are physical

1607.2 --> 1611.8500000000001
objects in literal positions I think

1609.27 --> 1613.23
that's a pretty good step already now

1611.85 --> 1615.9599999999998
that doesn't mean that I'm gonna

1613.23 --> 1618.66
immediately know exactly like how

1615.96 --> 1621.18
they're made and all that the

1618.66 --> 1624.15
manifestations why they are set the way

1621.18 --> 1625.5900000000001
they are I just know that they are and

1624.15 --> 1627.95
it's a great likelihood that there's

1625.59 --> 1630.78
electricity involved in some way

1627.95 --> 1636.06
naturally in the realm is part of just

1630.78 --> 1637.98
the setup so how does Earth have a

1636.06 --> 1640.82
magnetic field that oh well of course

1637.98 --> 1643.35
well since I just answered that question

1640.82 --> 1648.2
why would you assume that I know that

1643.35 --> 1648.1999999999998
why why would you think that I know that

1654.17 --> 1660.23
no no good servant no the people that

1658.7 --> 1663.1100000000001
are going to be saved are going to be

1660.23 --> 1663.56
saved and the people that are not are

1663.11 --> 1665.84
not

1663.56 --> 1670.01
it's no use people are not gonna listen

1665.84 --> 1672.4099999999999
to this [ __ ] anymore if they are lured

1670.01 --> 1675.1
into the idea of redemption through

1672.41 --> 1678.53
Christ then they will come to you

1675.1 --> 1681.3799999999999
there's no use trying to bring Christ to

1678.53 --> 1683.45
these idiots out there it's no use

1681.38 --> 1685.0700000000002
they're not even gonna listen they're

1683.45 --> 1689.3
not gonna hear you they're not even

1685.07 --> 1691.1899999999998
gonna have a recording in their head of

1689.3 --> 1694.1299999999999
you saying that for later

1691.19 --> 1698.3600000000001
they're not gonna remember it unless you

1694.13 --> 1702.17
know them more personally though I don't

1698.36 --> 1704.36
know man but I get it you're you feel

1702.17 --> 1707.3000000000002
the tension as well and you're yeah

1704.36 --> 1708.86
that's your response it's like oh god

1707.3 --> 1710.99
the pressure is something bad is coming

1708.86 --> 1713.09
we need to bring Christ to people I get

1710.99 --> 1713.69
it's a very basic response it's a good

1713.09 --> 1716.9299999999998
response

1713.69 --> 1720.74
you just got to realize that you can't

1716.93 --> 1723.14
just you can't force it the only way

1720.74 --> 1728.81
really works is they come to you good

1723.14 --> 1731.66
servant if if the feel of the concept if

1728.81 --> 1735.6799999999998
that appeals to them they will have a

1731.66 --> 1738.7900000000002
chance but just you telling it is not

1735.68 --> 1742.0700000000002
gonna make them do anything

1738.79 --> 1745.01
unfortunately right good servant yeah I

1742.07 --> 1746.87
will I will probably get back on on the

1745.01 --> 1750.1299999999999
show next Thursday you say all right

1746.87 --> 1750.1299999999999
that would be cool

1754.43 --> 1761.13
right Missouri bear that that's a good

1758.1 --> 1763.6799999999998
tip well if you've never if you don't

1761.13 --> 1767.88
know anything about the Bible story to

1763.68 --> 1770.76
begin with you know if you've but who in

1767.88 --> 1774.18
this world would just not know anything

1770.76 --> 1777.12
about the Bible and all that seems off

1774.18 --> 1779.73
almost there might be some creepy

1777.12 --> 1781.59
liberals that have just sewed well that

1779.73 --> 1784.08
they literally don't know a word about

1781.59 --> 1784.8899999999999
it because they got these reinforced

1784.08 --> 1788.73
allergies

1784.89 --> 1799.98
socially but people that just completely

1788.73 --> 1803.22
don't know it is rare you know it's like

1799.98 --> 1805.38
this like I personally had to be fair I

1803.22 --> 1809.34
have not fully read through the Bible

1805.38 --> 1812.5800000000002
like every page but I do better damn

1809.34 --> 1815.04
well believe I I get it I get what it's

1812.58 --> 1819.6899999999998
about you don't even need to hear every

1815.04 --> 1823.7
word to get what it is you just need to

1819.69 --> 1827.5800000000002
figure it out you need to feel it and

1823.7 --> 1832.1000000000001
see the overarching implications that

1827.58 --> 1837.6499999999999
are very complex if you don't feel that

1832.1 --> 1837.6499999999999
then it's yeah it's just gonna be words

1841.9 --> 1851.48
secular public schools yeah no Bible

1844.61 --> 1853.76
yeah that's right though the Bible is

1851.48 --> 1854.59
not a standard part of school anymore it

1853.76 --> 1858.62
isn't

1854.59 --> 1860.51
there is some that do trade it but even

1858.62 --> 1863.6
they have to be very careful and

1860.51 --> 1865.43
basically say it is a religion and they

1863.6 --> 1867.77
have to keep it apart from science

1865.43 --> 1870.28
because science contradicts these things

1867.77 --> 1872.6
and then the science need to be

1870.28 --> 1875.21
prioritizes like oh yeah this is the

1872.6 --> 1877.73
belief and that is the real science so

1875.21 --> 1882.32
they say yeah that's now how it works

1877.73 --> 1885.25
it's annoying but yeah that's what

1882.32 --> 1885.25
schools have become

1895.72 --> 1903.16
all right well I think that the young

1900.95 --> 1907.46
Lee real way to really learn the Bible

1903.16 --> 1910.73
without being yea obstructed by school

1907.46 --> 1913.31
policy is to do it in a Sunday school or

1910.73 --> 1915.53
yeah at church at church you know

1913.31 --> 1918.44
because then you don't get distracted by

1915.53 --> 1920.06
nonsense and somebody that's gonna say

1918.44 --> 1922.55
but science is lying

1920.06 --> 1924.83
I trust the Bible more they're not gonna

1922.55 --> 1927.1399999999999
be attacked in church they might have

1924.83 --> 1929.72
some like oh but you shouldn't buy some

1927.14 --> 1932.1200000000001
well hawkish Christians they might do

1929.72 --> 1933.95
that a little but there's not going to

1932.12 --> 1935.9599999999998
be teachers basically threatening you

1933.95 --> 1938.75
with measures and [ __ ] if you say

1935.96 --> 1941.29
something like that you know because it

1938.75 --> 1941.29
is a church

1964.73 --> 1968.69
what are you talking about

1972.46 --> 1978.77
excuse me truth of coming what kind of

1976.34 --> 1980.87
ridiculous day are you looking for a ban

1978.77 --> 1989.3899999999999
this is really annoying

1980.87 --> 1991.1899999999998
you're being very annoying here why

1989.39 --> 1994.73
should you believe the flat earth if it

1991.19 --> 1998.54
can explain simple observe observable

1994.73 --> 1999.55
processes you mean like I explained to

1998.54 --> 2003.07
you

1999.55 --> 2006.46
exactly I explained to you I gave you an

2003.07 --> 2009.9099999999999
answer exactly so you're now basically

2006.46 --> 2013.39
straw Manning me by saying that I didn't

2009.91 --> 2015.3400000000001
give you an answer I did I gave you an

2013.39 --> 2017.98
answer you just apparently chose not to

2015.34 --> 2019.9599999999998
listen to it I don't know what red pill

2017.98 --> 2022.45
philosophy has to do with that he'll

2019.96 --> 2024.58
tell you the same thing or less because

2022.45 --> 2025.57
he doesn't really care too much about

2024.58 --> 2027.84
Club Ling's

2025.57 --> 2032.6499999999999
and all he's not even gonna entertain

2027.84 --> 2036.3999999999999
them put in full effort to answer their

2032.65 --> 2045.5800000000002
questions because I don't even know why

2036.4 --> 2049.7200000000003
I do it at times really but of what I do

2045.58 --> 2054.88
know is that I did give you a detailed

2049.72 --> 2057.5499999999997
explanation as to how why what is

2054.88 --> 2060.36
happening there what it is and what we

2057.55 --> 2060.36
know about it

2071.15 --> 2075.94
[Music]

2073.26 --> 2080.26
hey and if you're willing to settle for

2075.94 --> 2082.389
a model that is based on huge amounts of

2080.26 --> 2087.28
presupposition that will make claims

2082.389 --> 2091.119
that seem more detailed seem to fill in

2087.28 --> 2093.4900000000002
so much more details so that it appears

2091.119 --> 2095.77
that the model has more insight on

2093.49 --> 2097.6299999999997
reality well guess what it's still all

2095.77 --> 2100.41
based on presuppositions that are very

2097.63 --> 2103.23
easily dispelled so you're supposed

2100.41 --> 2107.5589999999997
presuppose the detailed knowledge is

2103.23 --> 2112.42
[ __ ] it's all conceptual fantasy

2107.559 --> 2116.23
garbage without proof and personally as

2112.42 --> 2120.69
a flood Arthur I prefer to go with the

2116.23 --> 2124.059
data that I know is real is data and

2120.69 --> 2127.69
then leave the interpretations to these

2124.059 --> 2130.42
speculators as much as possible and when

2127.69 --> 2132.76
I do speculate I am very careful and

2130.42 --> 2136.2400000000002
clear as to what I'm gonna presuppose

2132.76 --> 2138.73
when I do it to see what the potential

2136.24 --> 2140.77
options could be depending on certain

2138.73 --> 2144.39
circumstances because that is how you

2140.77 --> 2147.849
inquire reality in a truthful honest way

2144.39 --> 2150.04
you don't presuppose you don't go with a

2147.849 --> 2153.52
body of knowledge that fills in so many

2150.04 --> 2156.579
details when it's all based on things

2153.52 --> 2160.21
that are already disproven then you're

2156.579 --> 2164.5
just wasting your own time with false

2160.21 --> 2167.71
beliefs beliefs of all knowingness when

2164.5 --> 2172.299
you absolutely do not know because it's

2167.71 --> 2174.13
based on errors and lies you can

2172.299 --> 2176.74
convince yourself all day long that

2174.13 --> 2179.4900000000002
because there are so many answers even

2176.74 --> 2182.3799999999997
though they're wrong and lies that

2179.49 --> 2184.24
that's the better option well then you

2182.38 --> 2186.76
got a problem because then you have no

2184.24 --> 2188.6499999999996
more critical thinking left in order to

2186.76 --> 2191.829
warn you that you probably shouldn't be

2188.65 --> 2195.46
doing that then it will make you

2191.829 --> 2199.55
delusional yeah

2195.46 --> 2201.8
she was taught these days in critical

2199.55 --> 2205.4900000000002
thought you know it's not something

2201.8 --> 2207.8
that's it's commonly taught anymore I'll

2205.49 --> 2209.99
just just Ram that data in there and

2207.8 --> 2213.1090000000004
then eventually you'll start to convince

2209.99 --> 2215.99
yourself that the data is true because

2213.109 --> 2217.0
there's so much of it and that's how it

2215.99 --> 2222.3489999999997
works

2217.0 --> 2225.01
people will convince themselves because

2222.349 --> 2225.01
they got fooled

2237.08 --> 2243.17
many young yeah I think so I don't know

2239.369 --> 2243.17
why would I don't know

2259.15 --> 2270.719
that's right yeah well the Griffins II

2266.469 --> 2273.369
yeah rival was indeed written by the

2270.719 --> 2276.039
cleverest goat herders that's right

2273.369 --> 2279.369
and guess what can pretty much guarantee

2276.039 --> 2285.13
those goat herders we're a lot smarter

2279.369 --> 2288.9990000000003
than you are they then were smarter than

2285.13 --> 2291.579
you are right now if they time jump to

2288.999 --> 2294.43
this place take your place

2291.579 --> 2296.38
guess what they'd crush it they thrive

2294.43 --> 2297.94
they'd stumble a couple of times they

2296.38 --> 2300.5190000000002
might endanger themselves because

2297.94 --> 2302.7690000000002
they're used to common decency and honor

2300.519 --> 2305.049
right that's a big problem for them now

2302.769 --> 2308.769
in a world where everything is just gama

2305.049 --> 2310.869
devil garbage but they'd still thrive

2308.769 --> 2312.9399999999996
because they'd be much stronger in their

2310.869 --> 2314.71
own person and they'd be much more

2312.94 --> 2317.92
critical in their thinking they could

2314.71 --> 2320.4990000000003
survive and thrive a hundred times

2317.92 --> 2323.14
better than you can because you're stuck

2320.499 --> 2326.9199999999996
up in society you're all stuck in there

2323.14 --> 2328.989
you you can't get loose anymore you gave

2326.92 --> 2331.859
that all up you gave up your personal

2328.989 --> 2336.91
sovereignty to become a cog in a system

2331.859 --> 2339.13
driven by illusions so yeah those goat

2336.91 --> 2341.469
herders you better damn well believe

2339.13 --> 2345.359
they were very freakin smart they were

2341.469 --> 2345.359
freakin smarter than you were buddy

2369.13 --> 2378.03
[Music]

2390.21 --> 2393.21
yeah

2430.89 --> 2444.0
oh nice to hear Missouri bear yeah I've

2442.26 --> 2445.8900000000003
been season quite a lot of bees go

2444.0 --> 2450.78
around here was quite a good site there

2445.89 --> 2469.16
they're looking around love it there's

2450.78 --> 2469.1600000000003
one right now pretty big ones even

2474.44 --> 2476.4700000000003
Oh

2494.72 --> 2498.98
yeah good servant but you know that

2496.849 --> 2501.88
can't really happen because as soon as

2498.98 --> 2505.67
that happens it's over for them

2501.88 --> 2509.839
the whole ball religion rests solely on

2505.67 --> 2511.4900000000002
never conceding never conceding that

2509.839 --> 2513.46
they're wrong that's the the whole thing

2511.49 --> 2516.589
that that drives it as soon as you

2513.46 --> 2520.15
concede it's over the the bring the

2516.589 --> 2520.15
dream snaps it's over

2520.18 --> 2527.68
that's why they spend all their day all

2523.25 --> 2531.04
the time just doubling down red herring

2527.68 --> 2534.859
double thinking their way through and

2531.04 --> 2536.48
yeah that's what they do because they

2534.859 --> 2540.0499999999997
can never concede because as soon as

2536.48 --> 2541.849
they concede any detail any facts that

2540.05 --> 2543.2200000000003
is presented to them about their model

2541.849 --> 2549.98
it's over

2543.22 --> 2553.2099999999996
the dream snaps it's gone and it'll just

2549.98 --> 2557.96
leave this this feeling of dread and

2553.21 --> 2565.04
painful nostalgia and most people can't

2557.96 --> 2567.14
deal with that yeah it it I it felt to

2565.04 --> 2568.79
me on several occasions and it kind of

2567.14 --> 2571.0099999999998
feels like you're being orphaned all of

2568.79 --> 2573.05
a sudden like you lose everyone you ever

2571.01 --> 2582.17
knew that's kind of how it feel felt

2573.05 --> 2584.42
like to me so it is very painful and

2582.17 --> 2587.63
should not be underestimated especially

2584.42 --> 2590.0
for those that have doubled down until

2587.63 --> 2591.92
this far because the more you double

2590.0 --> 2595.04
down the more painful the backlash will

2591.92 --> 2597.64
be they know it that's why they get so

2595.04 --> 2597.64
desperate

2609.45 --> 2617.2
or axial bends look they don't have

2614.74 --> 2622.2599999999998
evidence they think they have evidence

2617.2 --> 2624.339
and they think that evidence is

2622.26 --> 2627.67
significant in some way that it proves

2624.339 --> 2632.0789999999997
anything but yeah that's based on the

2627.67 --> 2634.9300000000003
mindset that is coming from a situation

2632.079 --> 2637.0
where they basically bypassed empirical

2634.93 --> 2639.839
standard they bypass the scientific

2637.0 --> 2643.81
method into the conceptual fantastical

2639.839 --> 2646.21
so they they don't even realize that

2643.81 --> 2649.24
they have no more grip over real

2646.21 --> 2652.569
evidence because they abandoned it

2649.24 --> 2655.8999999999996
because their religion people in their

2652.569 --> 2659.14
religion the ballers the ballers NASA

2655.9 --> 2662.38
has convinced them to abandon it and

2659.14 --> 2665.2
they did it for science because they

2662.38 --> 2668.829
thought they had to give them so much

2665.2 --> 2671.77
liberation so much room to just not be

2668.829 --> 2675.94
drought dragged down by pesky earthly

2671.77 --> 2678.819
matters an empirical confirmable data

2675.94 --> 2681.339
that would be required to prove anything

2678.819 --> 2684.13
no they can just do whatever they like

2681.339 --> 2686.95
and if they can reason it out then it's

2684.13 --> 2689.829
good enough science that's the new

2686.95 --> 2691.6899999999996
science and they don't even realize this

2689.829 --> 2695.9500000000003
because this has been conditioned into

2691.69 --> 2698.02
the public for at least 20 years I had

2695.95 --> 2703.72
that conditioning they attempted it on

2698.02 --> 2706.329
me and unfortunately I kind of fell for

2703.72 --> 2709.359
it back in time because it gave me and

2706.329 --> 2711.13
all this room giant amounts of room and

2709.359 --> 2714.97
made me feel like I was in control

2711.13 --> 2718.589
because I could figure out reality in

2714.97 --> 2718.589
the way that I saw it

2720.92 --> 2728.599
then they started that [ __ ] like yeah

2725.23 --> 2733.94
before the end of the the 20 century the

2728.599 --> 2735.279
20th century so yeah most people are

2733.94 --> 2738.619
used to that

2735.279 --> 2742.16
unfortunately because they lost the

2738.619 --> 2744.9500000000003
original foundation for actual science

2742.16 --> 2750.6499999999996
they lost it they lost the significance

2744.95 --> 2757.73
and the the strictness of the empirical

2750.65 --> 2759.71
scientific method hmm oh thank you

2757.73 --> 2762.619
Guns of Navarone RMP you much

2759.71 --> 2765.319
appreciated 20 Canadian dollar super

2762.619 --> 2768.049
chat donation I enjoy your show no Conan

2765.319 --> 2771.049
sending rhetoric thank you I do my best

2768.049 --> 2777.23
stick it to keep that out I really do my

2771.049 --> 2781.549
best it's stuff sometimes oh thank you

2777.23 --> 2783.71
Walker Walker 78 for the 5-pound super

2781.549 --> 2786.91
jetta nation for your good work wish it

2783.71 --> 2792.91
was more thank you

2786.91 --> 2792.91
wish it was more yeah I kind of duty but

2793.089 --> 2799.099
yeah I'm just gonna keep on going with

2796.069 --> 2802.099
the show for now and we'll see where it

2799.099 --> 2804.17
goes you know I've also been thinking I

2802.099 --> 2807.309
don't know it must be the weather I'm

2804.17 --> 2809.779
just like ah I wanna I want a garden

2807.309 --> 2816.4300000000003
I've actually been thinking of how I

2809.779 --> 2819.589
could somehow get something maybe like a

2816.43 --> 2822.98
it's a mini greenhouse that I could

2819.589 --> 2827.029
maybe even fabricate myself just a bunch

2822.98 --> 2828.619
of wood and and PVC on my balcony

2827.029 --> 2831.98
because that way it would be protected

2828.619 --> 2833.539
from the wind I don't know I don't know

2831.98 --> 2837.589
how long it would last but I'm just

2833.539 --> 2840.6400000000003
feeling this urge like ah I wanna do

2837.589 --> 2840.64
something with my garden

2841.78 --> 2851.63
plant strawberries that's cute that

2848.81 --> 2855.5
could work but I was thinking more of

2851.63 --> 2857.63
plants that could grow vertically so I

2855.5 --> 2861.83
was thinking of tomatoes now tomatoes

2857.63 --> 2866.27
are very quick growing very delicious to

2861.83 --> 2869.15
have him fresh fruits their fruits not

2866.27 --> 2871.0099999999998
vegetables actually he but yeah tomatoes

2869.15 --> 2872.78
are very easy great for this type of

2871.01 --> 2877.13
weather I could do that but again I need

2872.78 --> 2879.77
I could just risk just just getting a

2877.13 --> 2882.9100000000003
standard pot and just whatever happens

2879.77 --> 2885.35
happens I could do that too I guess

2882.91 --> 2887.54
maybe I just need to do it because I

2885.35 --> 2889.73
just need to do it I don't have to make

2887.54 --> 2893.11
some long-term durable plan I just need

2889.73 --> 2897.23
to freaking do it I think I will just

2893.11 --> 2902.0
get a pot dirt-poor the freaking plant

2897.23 --> 2907.79
in it done and that's it and then take

2902.0 --> 2910.58
care of it plant wheat when wheat in a

2907.79 --> 2914.5099999999998
in a plant pot on my balcony are you

2910.58 --> 2919.0
serious or you mean for like the the

2914.51 --> 2919.0
what is it that a special type of grass

2925.75 --> 2931.599
well that's a complicated question there

2928.42 --> 2940.81
Digital prison don't exactly what you're

2931.599 --> 2945.42
referring to specifically they sway one

2940.81 --> 2945.42
way or the other one what does that mean

2949.42 --> 2952.579
[Music]

2957.24 --> 2966.7799999999997
yeah Rattus Rattus Allah is our name but

2965.22 --> 2968.3999999999996
yeah that's not gonna work

2966.78 --> 2970.8300000000004
I don't have a garden it's gonna be

2968.4 --> 2973.7000000000003
plant pots on my balcony that's it

2970.83 --> 2977.45
that's all I got it that's all that's in

2973.7 --> 2977.45
within range for me

2983.44 --> 2991.63
they sway one way or they know oh it's a

2988.39 --> 2993.7599999999998
balancing act and if one tips one way

2991.63 --> 2995.619
then eventually there will be a counter

2993.76 --> 2999.73
move that's just it's a swing of a

2995.619 --> 3002.46
pendulum forever so hey if there's a

2999.73 --> 3004.68
giant momentum to rid the world of all

3002.46 --> 3006.059
evil that's great there will be good

3004.68 --> 3008.6699999999996
it's going to be awesome

3006.059 --> 3010.4100000000003
and then the darkness will creep in from

3008.67 --> 3017.039
the inside it always works like that

3010.41 --> 3021.1189999999997
always always and yeah that like

3017.039 --> 3022.829
technically like even theoretically this

3021.119 --> 3024.839
is so theoretical is probably never

3022.829 --> 3027.03
gonna happen but theoretically even if

3024.839 --> 3030.3289999999997
like good general public all of them in

3027.03 --> 3032.52
the entire world would literally read

3030.329 --> 3036.119
the entire world of the government

3032.52 --> 3037.369
system forever like say it's done you're

3036.119 --> 3042.3900000000003
all fired

3037.369 --> 3046.099
war [ __ ] fight it off and somehow

3042.39 --> 3049.65
prevail it's a good look at that then

3046.099 --> 3054.27
even then yeah it's a great evil that'll

3049.65 --> 3059.25
be gone he'll come back because we are

3054.27 --> 3061.65
human beings and it's a balancing act it

3059.25 --> 3063.63
always is and if everything becomes too

3061.65 --> 3066.4500000000003
good evil people will stand up because

3063.63 --> 3068.4900000000002
they get sick of it and if things get

3066.45 --> 3069.779
too evil good people will stand up

3068.49 --> 3072.75
because they will get sick of it and

3069.779 --> 3076.74
it's just that's how it's gonna be and

3072.75 --> 3079.289
if the old evil people are gone then new

3076.74 --> 3083.27
ones will be born they will become evil

3079.289 --> 3083.2700000000004
during their life they just will

3089.08 --> 3095.17
or or switch like that just like that

3093.13 --> 3098.11
you know if there's this is the thing

3095.17 --> 3101.17
about like the the frequency and period

3098.11 --> 3104.5
of the pure evil and the the seduction

3101.17 --> 3109.2400000000002
of that is if evil is not seen if it is

3104.5 --> 3111.31
not felt by people then somebody new

3109.24 --> 3116.1699999999996
that has never felt it will not

3111.31 --> 3118.63
recognize its elements and be inclined

3116.17 --> 3123.19
to accidentally jump right into it

3118.63 --> 3125.92
without realizing what it is that's much

3123.19 --> 3132.55
more likely to happen when when they've

3125.92 --> 3135.94
never known evil and that way if all the

3132.55 --> 3139.6600000000003
evil were gone the young ones they will

3135.94 --> 3143.23
by accidents do that it will happen

3139.66 --> 3145.12
there's nothing nothing you can do you

3143.23 --> 3147.58
could teach a child anything you want

3145.12 --> 3150.8199999999997
you can deprive them and teach them one

3147.58 --> 3154.81
way the other way it doesn't matter it's

3150.82 --> 3159.9100000000003
gonna happen anyway these things are

3154.81 --> 3168.67
written they are written in Souls it

3159.91 --> 3170.47
happens so yeah balancing it's never

3168.67 --> 3172.42
still balance though you know it's

3170.47 --> 3174.3999999999996
always gonna be moving one way or there

3172.42 --> 3182.38
it's always going to be moving it can't

3174.4 --> 3183.9100000000003
stay still it can't work that's another

3182.38 --> 3189.4
way of saying it Missouri Bear head the

3183.91 --> 3192.87
devil is always prancing about it's a

3189.4 --> 3192.87
funnier way of describing it
