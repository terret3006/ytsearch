2.33 --> 9.809000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.0 --> 12.599
early-bird number Oh God which one is it

9.809 --> 17.759999999999998
59 I'm your host

12.599 --> 19.83
Arwen and yeah today almost the same as

17.76 --> 24.869
yesterday a little bit colder a little

19.83 --> 28.288999999999998
bit more wet and yeah for the rest it's

24.869 --> 33.149
still the same so yeah sorry for

28.289 --> 35.04
starting out a little late it's kind of

33.149 --> 37.44
funny I felt it coming because

35.04 --> 41.61
technically when I went out to get some

37.44 --> 44.19
groceries it looks like it could fit

41.61 --> 48.18
exactly but I felt I was gonna be late

44.19 --> 52.11
and I did because yeah halfway I bumped

48.18 --> 56.129
into somebody I know and I had a very

52.11 --> 59.149
long conversation about 50 minutes at

56.129 --> 62.67
least maybe longer 20 minutes about

59.149 --> 66.15
cancer issues and alternative medicine

62.67 --> 67.71000000000001
and what's really going on in allopathic

66.15 --> 69.63000000000001
medicine and all that yeah very

67.71 --> 73.25
interesting conversation from a person

69.63 --> 77.49
who's been in there and still has the

73.25 --> 82.009
long-term consequences from allopathic

77.49 --> 85.229
cancer treatment and yeah you can't just

82.009 --> 87.45
like walk away out of that break it off

85.229 --> 90.09
just like that it was very sensitive and

87.45 --> 94.049
needed to be talked about she had so she

90.09 --> 96.60000000000001
she had the the need to talk about it so

94.049 --> 98.57900000000001
yeah it just happened I felt it coming

96.6 --> 102.99
and that's why I'm a little bit late so

98.579 --> 105.55999999999999
yeah sorry guys try to not be late in

102.99 --> 105.55999999999999
the near future

111.03 --> 126.399
going on man nice it really does seem

119.77 --> 129.039
like it does seem like now that Nathan

126.399 --> 131.65
is gone from life streaming that all the

129.039 --> 135.66
ballers the standard ballers are just

131.65 --> 141.459
piling on to my comments section and

135.66 --> 144.64
yeah I guess that in the Indonesian way

141.459 --> 146.41
I should be happy about that because I'm

144.64 --> 153.16
getting more attention well I'm not

146.41 --> 159.4
really because I just don't have the

153.16 --> 164.47
patience keep on entertaining religious

159.4 --> 172.11
idiots constantly I'm sick of the red

164.47 --> 172.10999999999999
herrings I'm just sick of their attitude

172.78 --> 179.83
they're only in the way that is their

175.36 --> 185.17000000000002
function they're not here to learn not

179.83 --> 188.26000000000002
at all not even close they've set their

185.17 --> 190.75
minds that they've learned anything they

188.26 --> 192.91
need to know and if they would be able

190.75 --> 195.67
to learn something new then they know

192.91 --> 200.89
they have decided exactly from where

195.67 --> 203.38
that information is coming and yeah how

200.89 --> 206.07999999999998
much they will allow themselves to

203.38 --> 210.26999999999998
scrutinize it because they are extremely

206.08 --> 215.62
selective in this process and I'm

210.27 --> 219.45000000000002
getting kind of fed up with this yeah

215.62 --> 219.45000000000002
I'm getting fed up with a lot of things

222.63 --> 228.23
I'm just wondering is this is this the

226.68 --> 231.68
future of humanity

228.23 --> 231.67999999999998
is that it

240.02 --> 247.34
does that really it you know like I

244.01 --> 248.82999999999998
could imagine I could imagine not saying

247.34 --> 255.38
that it will happen eventually

248.83 --> 257.63
flat-earthers just walk away because we

255.38 --> 260.71999999999997
figured it out we figured it all out

257.63 --> 265.43
we know what is left to do to confirm

260.72 --> 267.88000000000005
certain things to affirm things to find

265.43 --> 272.78000000000003
out to progress it's not gonna happen

267.88 --> 276.40999999999997
probably and we are just sick of this

272.78 --> 280.36999999999995
religious fanatical intolerable trash

276.41 --> 283.67
heap of human beings stalking us every

280.37 --> 284.9
turn and pissing over us and even trying

283.67 --> 289.19
to make a living

284.9 --> 292.23999999999995
pissing onto us it is so sickening that

289.19 --> 294.83
I predict that if there is no actual

292.24 --> 299.42
transition stage and enough guaranteeing

294.83 --> 302.71999999999997
there is I hope there is that will walk

299.42 --> 306.31
away and then yeah these ballers is what

302.72 --> 309.44000000000005
humanity is left with as the winners

306.31 --> 317.47
congratulations you won you've turned

309.44 --> 320.18
into a total anti human pile of garbage

317.47 --> 322.04
pile of garbage without a proper

320.18 --> 326.48
consciousness without proper morale

322.04 --> 329.12
without no even knowledge what they are

326.48 --> 331.79
and their history and not caring not

329.12 --> 337.49
caring about anything purely ego driven

331.79 --> 340.28000000000003
and ego delusions driven is that that

337.49 --> 342.19
would we're going to end up with

340.28 --> 346.4
I predict that if that is gonna happen

342.19 --> 348.83
it's not gonna be too long until pretty

346.4 --> 353.28999999999996
much the entirety of humanity is gonna

348.83 --> 357.68
conclude that it's no longer worth it's

353.29 --> 360.53000000000003
right all that that anti human liberal

357.68 --> 362.66
[ __ ] that we're now trying to fight that

360.53 --> 365.78
we're trying to find reasons for why

362.66 --> 368.45000000000005
that is so wrong oh if you keep up this

365.78 --> 371.27
kind of delusional denialist [ __ ]

368.45 --> 374.65999999999997
behavior then we're all going to end up

371.27 --> 377.93
wanting that and you're gonna wish that

374.66 --> 380.69
as well because yeah there's only so far

377.93 --> 385.43
you can drown in your own [ __ ] before

380.69 --> 387.79
your body starts to falter under it just

385.43 --> 387.79
so you know

390.719 --> 394.339
so this

396.81 --> 409.61
Cheers hmm unto the supremacy of our

404.94 --> 409.61
species we're the best

409.669 --> 415.02
we're the best at lying to ourselves

412.74 --> 419.93
we're the best at pretending with

415.02 --> 424.83
something we're not we're the best at

419.93 --> 427.71
denying actual contact mentally

424.83 --> 431.28
spiritually with everything other than

427.71 --> 433.58
our own inner created desires so what

431.28 --> 433.58
you want

438.93 --> 442.07
I am indeed

456.68 --> 465.08
yeah Nassau C London a winner takes it

461.21 --> 468.52
all including their own life hope you're

465.08 --> 468.52
happy about it mm-hmm

471.25 --> 482.23
you're gonna win everything's gonna die

477.69 --> 486.01
everything does

482.23 --> 489.16
if this delusion says culture of

486.01 --> 490.87
foundational lies is gonna continue then

489.16 --> 493.48
everything is gonna die eventually

490.87 --> 497.34000000000003
because the delusion will migrate and we

493.48 --> 503.83000000000004
will allow absurd death and destruction

497.34 --> 507.19
and it will be justified for juvenile

503.83 --> 511.93
reasons absurdly short-sighted reasons

507.19 --> 514.57
and you'll all love it you're so

511.93 --> 517.45
superior and you know we can sacrifice

514.57 --> 520.4190000000001
whatever we want on this planet because

517.45 --> 523.09
there's always more out there hmm

520.419 --> 525.37
you could always escape last minute get

523.09 --> 528.58
on that rocket ship when everything

525.37 --> 530.97
turns to death and rotting corpses over

528.58 --> 532.72
here and all the nature dies out

530.97 --> 534.76
whatever's left of it

532.72 --> 539.1700000000001
could always escape on that spaceship to

534.76 --> 541.65
the other planets yeah just hope you

539.17 --> 541.65
could do it

543.66 --> 549.42
yeah

546.25 --> 549.42
I don't think so

549.94 --> 554.23
but you can die hoping

566.57 --> 569.7700000000001
yeah it's time

573.12 --> 576.329
it's a get rid of some trolls I'm sick

575.79 --> 579.389
of you

576.329 --> 583.62
you have no function but to make

579.389 --> 587.66
everything worse I'm done with it I'm

583.62 --> 591.779
gonna ban you all so yeah make that last

587.66 --> 594.42
smartass remark please do so enjoy it

591.779 --> 596.3389999999999
while it's there because it's going to

594.42 --> 598.05
be there for just a few seconds and then

596.339 --> 600.8290000000001
there's never going to be anything from

598.05 --> 600.829
you here again

631.51 --> 637.86
no idea I'm not gonna be talking to

635.2 --> 640.5400000000001
myself I'm still talking to my audience

637.86 --> 647.3100000000001
still talking to whoever's listening and

640.54 --> 647.31
just saying I'm done with this real crap

647.76 --> 660.97
this just this intolerable [ __ ] and I

654.34 --> 663.3100000000001
will ban you all I will so yeah keep it

660.97 --> 667.39
up keep it up keep on trying spend your

663.31 --> 670.18
afternoon programming your sucks that

667.39 --> 676.9
try to [ __ ] all over our wins hang out

670.18 --> 679.81
come on bring it on do it do it waste

676.9 --> 686.79
all your time on that [ __ ] you know

679.81 --> 686.79
lifers good luck

692.31 --> 700.4899999999999
so let's see if I can add some guests in

696.449 --> 700.49
here because

703.55 --> 709.4699999999999
feel less than Pleasant not a lot of

707.73 --> 715.91
good things to talk about at this moment

709.47 --> 715.9100000000001
ah hey Constance

724.88 --> 732.98
yeah Constance is awesome see I was with

731.31 --> 736.41
her on a hangout another day with

732.98 --> 738.12
aunties I think a really great person

736.41 --> 739.4599999999999
very positive I could use some of that

738.12 --> 743.22
right now

739.46 --> 747.6600000000001
because I really do feel like I'm just

743.22 --> 752.19
raging some someone to actually temper

747.66 --> 754.77
me and remind me why it is all worth it

752.19 --> 757.6500000000001
and while there is still hope for

754.77 --> 763.41
Humanity despite all this crap I'm just

757.65 --> 768.09
seeing well all the main differences

763.41 --> 772.14
though that I get I see crap with all

768.09 --> 776.07
people everyone almost everyone and

772.14 --> 779.52
including myself not trying to deny the

776.07 --> 782.73
things that I have impulsive issues with

779.52 --> 784.9499999999999
let's just say it like that or ideas

782.73 --> 787.62
that don't seem very constructive to

784.95 --> 791.49
myself but trouble letting go that kind

787.62 --> 795.9
of thing but I'm very clear about that

791.49 --> 800.16
and I can tolerate people's mistakes or

795.9 --> 803.55
people's programmed teachings as long as

800.16 --> 807.5699999999999
they're actually willing to look at them

803.55 --> 810.87
inside their own mind and I can see if

807.57 --> 813.9300000000001
they do this by their response when I

810.87 --> 815.91
explain things to them and that's the

813.93 --> 818.2199999999999
big difference with a lot of ballers out

815.91 --> 821.7199999999999
here and the ones that I get on the show

818.22 --> 824.73
as well what conspiracy caps is know is

821.72 --> 828.39
the best example I could think of it's

824.73 --> 832.02
just somebody just stares right at you

828.39 --> 835.3199999999999
has this conversation nice maybe not

832.02 --> 838.56
stare at you talk at you and you're

835.32 --> 842.4300000000001
gonna say it's things and they're just

838.56 --> 845.13
not responding they obviously do not

842.43 --> 848.3399999999999
have the internal energetic response

845.13 --> 851.1899999999999
that I can sense nor extrapolate from

848.34 --> 853.08
their response that is required for them

851.19 --> 856.97
to actually learn to actually progress

853.08 --> 862.07
no their mind is set they have no

856.97 --> 865.02
interest in information whatsoever and

862.07 --> 868.11
that is something I can't tolerate if

865.02 --> 872.46
I'm utterly repulsive because everyone

868.11 --> 875.4
can be mistaken everyone can false

872.46 --> 881.0400000000001
teachings within them if they're not

875.4 --> 885.03
willing to improve themselves to

881.04 --> 888.3499999999999
actually try to work out where the

885.03 --> 888.35
mistakes are and fix it

889.69 --> 896.23
then there's nothing I have to say to

893.26 --> 900.76
you or do with you and I will not

896.23 --> 906.28
tolerate your presence so simple as that

900.76 --> 909.1
I'm not gonna do that yeah in the real

906.28 --> 912.1
physical life world I can walk away

909.1 --> 914.9200000000001
thank God I can't this place is a little

912.1 --> 919.21
harder I'm just gonna have to clean up

914.92 --> 921.9699999999999
the [ __ ] heads and shovel them outside

919.21 --> 924.6
so the scoops are on their way just so

921.97 --> 933.5500000000001
you know the scoops are on their way and

924.6 --> 936.96
I'm scooping you out Soylent Green is

933.55 --> 936.9599999999999
made out of Globus

943.32 --> 952.84
hey grantee David Reed music man at GM

949.0 --> 955.75
chocolates saying legendary looming

952.84 --> 960.52
hyena 2.0 yeah it was a good video the

955.75 --> 965.94
other day it's awesome Jason McCormick

960.52 --> 965.9399999999999
the red path that's Sylvester

971.92 --> 976.019
yeah it's a lot of people here in chat

978.88 --> 985.42
yeah Lewis Lewis I'm not letting you on

982.12 --> 987.85
the show Lewis and you can stop trying

985.42 --> 989.92
to act like you're the better friendly

987.85 --> 993.5790000000001
person to me Lewis because you are a

989.92 --> 997.6899999999999
creepy deviant Lewis and you're a

993.579 --> 1000.42
pathological liar and somewhat of a

997.69 --> 1004.35
psychopath here and there but overall

1000.42 --> 1006.42
you take a pretty okay stance so that

1004.35 --> 1009.63
makes you tolerable but you are a

1006.42 --> 1014.009
deviant person and I'm not allowing you

1009.63 --> 1016.92
on here and in retrospect yeah I had

1014.009 --> 1020.79
some complaints from flat-earthers like

1016.92 --> 1023.3389999999999
why would you let conspiracy cats on

1020.79 --> 1027.539
because he is a disgusting liar

1023.339 --> 1028.98
and yeah in retrospect maybe I shouldn't

1027.539 --> 1034.459
have on the other hand I did have a

1028.98 --> 1040.909
pretty good pretty good show was amusing

1034.459 --> 1046.5890000000002
so it's conflicting but I'm not here to

1040.909 --> 1048.7800000000002
give you your petri dish moment and just

1046.589 --> 1052.22
show us how good you are at diarrhea

1048.78 --> 1054.289
dumping all over everything you hate or

1052.22 --> 1058.97
pretending that you're the better person

1054.289 --> 1063.71
because there's no room for that here

1058.97 --> 1069.89
you just wallow in your own crap

1063.71 --> 1071.75
and your own the Islamic whatever you

1069.89 --> 1074.8400000000001
want to call it in your own shows just

1071.75 --> 1079.57
enjoy it love it you know you're the

1074.84 --> 1079.57
victor in your own safe space keep it up

1081.16 --> 1084.5800000000002
but yeah

1087.81 --> 1094.59
if you want to be serious actually do

1092.04 --> 1097.47
some actual looking into things and

1094.59 --> 1101.03
figuring out yeah i might allow you

1097.47 --> 1106.28
under the conditions very specifically

1101.03 --> 1110.01
very very specifically that you do

1106.28 --> 1112.92
concede two things and that you do

1110.01 --> 1117.48
answer questions without deviation and

1112.92 --> 1123.5700000000002
if i tell you to answer directly without

1117.48 --> 1127.17
a sub context or a red herring or any

1123.57 --> 1129.4199999999998
kind of meta talk only the answer then

1127.17 --> 1132.03
you will or you will be kicked just like

1129.42 --> 1135.0600000000002
happen with conspiracy cats the house

1132.03 --> 1138.69
are the conditions that i will bring up

1135.06 --> 1140.9099999999999
and we tried to be a little bit less

1138.69 --> 1143.63
interruptive so I was with conspiracy

1140.91 --> 1146.43
cats because why my patience was

1143.63 --> 1148.6200000000001
exceptionally thin at that point for

1146.43 --> 1150.99
obvious reasons that I explained that's

1148.62 --> 1154.32
not gonna happen next time but yeah if

1150.99 --> 1156.24
you're ever gonna be on here as a as one

1154.32 --> 1158.28
of the more notorious ballers these are

1156.24 --> 1162.6
the conditions and you're gonna take it

1158.28 --> 1164.19
or you're gonna leave and for now I'm

1162.6 --> 1170.3899999999999
not gonna let you on because I'm just

1164.19 --> 1174.78
not in the mood not mentally prepared to

1170.39 --> 1177.0200000000002
engage in that kind of social activity

1174.78 --> 1177.02
right now

1186.93 --> 1191.96
now something ironic I'm not forcing

1189.33 --> 1195.54
anyone to say in their own safe space

1191.96 --> 1199.14
you know you can just stop doing that

1195.54 --> 1202.01
[ __ ] act like a normal person and maybe

1199.14 --> 1206.75
engage flat-earthers like normal people

1202.01 --> 1212.48
instead of hiding in Tim the jack off

1206.75 --> 1216.06
fake loser very much loser

1212.48 --> 1218.93
disgusting pathological liar show that

1216.06 --> 1221.34
[ __ ] hole where you keep on hiding

1218.93 --> 1225.15
you're not gonna do anything there

1221.34 --> 1227.31
except wallow in his and your own vomit

1225.15 --> 1229.3200000000002
that's what you're gonna be doing over

1227.31 --> 1231.36
there so if you want to get out of that

1229.32 --> 1234.48
safe space then actually approach

1231.36 --> 1237.6299999999999
somebody in a proper way and get some

1234.48 --> 1241.38
something real going instead of letting

1237.63 --> 1247.3200000000002
yourself get swept down into that into

1241.38 --> 1249.15
that gutter so that gutter so yeah I'm

1247.32 --> 1251.9099999999999
not keeping anyone in their safe spaces

1249.15 --> 1253.5300000000002
by not allowing them on my show they are

1251.91 --> 1255.93
the ones keeping themselves in those

1253.53 --> 1259.76
safe spaces by constantly showing up

1255.93 --> 1259.76
there that's what they're doing

1264.059 --> 1270.37
something ironic you wanted to come here

1266.65 --> 1273.73
I know and that's fine that he wants

1270.37 --> 1276.75
that I don't want that right now I'm not

1273.73 --> 1282.1
ready to deal with that level of

1276.75 --> 1286.54
aggravating interaction I'm still trying

1282.1 --> 1290.1399999999999
to become a calmer person here and calm

1286.54 --> 1293.74
down from all the aggravating stuff that

1290.14 --> 1300.46
has been coming from me from many sides

1293.74 --> 1305.26
in the last few days just try to get

1300.46 --> 1308.1100000000001
back to my old self the nice goody

1305.26 --> 1311.62
two-shoes are women it's not raging all

1308.11 --> 1315.1299999999999
the time it's much better and know that

1311.62 --> 1317.6499999999999
a half of the world loves it when people

1315.13 --> 1320.5590000000002
go all reiji's like oh it's amusing

1317.65 --> 1325.919
oh it's moving it has emotion yeah well

1320.559 --> 1328.3899999999999
I'm not into here to entertain but your

1325.919 --> 1331.24
superficial asses that have nothing

1328.39 --> 1333.97
better to do with their life but just

1331.24 --> 1336.88
stare at screens with people expressing

1333.97 --> 1339.69
things I'm here to educate and I'm here

1336.88 --> 1342.6100000000001
to talk about real things and progress

1339.69 --> 1347.3200000000002
and bring understanding that's what I'm

1342.61 --> 1351.4599999999998
here for so yeah I'm not on purpose

1347.32 --> 1354.52
planning to get over a river and yell at

1351.46 --> 1358.66
everyone I don't plan that I do it

1354.52 --> 1360.85
sometimes and to be fair no matter how

1358.66 --> 1364.48
much it's justified I end up always

1360.85 --> 1367.87
regretting it I always do and not

1364.48 --> 1372.24
because I was wrong but because doing

1367.87 --> 1374.25
that in general is just not very

1372.24 --> 1377.14
effective

1374.25 --> 1379.84
might be effective for the viewer count

1377.14 --> 1382.659
might be effective for commercial

1379.84 --> 1387.76
reasons but not for the actual goals

1382.659 --> 1392.8300000000002
that I care about so I'm gonna try to

1387.76 --> 1394.84
calm down yeah Louis yeah I know you're

1392.83 --> 1402.22
so sorry about so many things

1394.84 --> 1406.4189999999999
that's really nice you'll be sorry so

1402.22 --> 1409.09
I'm gonna get some yeah Super Saiyan

1406.419 --> 1412.2990000000002
rage indeed you don't stop it my hair is

1409.09 --> 1413.08
gonna go on the fire hmm I'm gonna get

1412.299 --> 1416.49
some tea

1413.08 --> 1416.49
I'll be back in

1456.41 --> 1465.38
so I'm gonna try to open up the panel in

1459.81 --> 1465.3799999999999
a more wide fashion let's see

1502.46 --> 1507.71
so alright the links out the master

1506.419 --> 1510.7990000000002
beach at and the fletchers

1507.71 --> 1515.1100000000001
early bird chat so yeah please do come

1510.799 --> 1517.629
on and spare me the suffering it's not

1515.11 --> 1521.139
it's not that bad

1517.629 --> 1521.139
could use some

1523.8 --> 1536.85
some distraction and I've had a lot of

1534.57 --> 1539.49
people contacting me on skype in the

1536.85 --> 1543.06
last few days it's very it's become hard

1539.49 --> 1545.46
to keep track of whoever is there it's

1543.06 --> 1552.1499999999999
not I haven't exactly identified

1545.46 --> 1555.39
everyone yet I wish there was a way to

1552.15 --> 1558.0500000000002
basically group contacts without

1555.39 --> 1561.39
actually putting them in one chat feed

1558.05 --> 1568.58
that would be handy because I think I

1561.39 --> 1568.5800000000002
got like too many contacts

1571.58 --> 1581.3899999999999
is this can you even count this anyway

1576.99 --> 1581.39
a lot

1585.85 --> 1589.619
that's what has been going on

1593.69 --> 1598.19
no I don't need this court server and

1596.21 --> 1602.3790000000001
I'm not gonna go on this court I've told

1598.19 --> 1602.3790000000001
you so many times I'm not gonna do it

1604.25 --> 1607.389
yeah chocolate scene

1610.5 --> 1617.94
yeah another skype group not the issue

1615.929 --> 1620.6100000000001
is not a skype group the issue is just

1617.94 --> 1622.3500000000001
the sheer amount of one-on-one contacts

1620.61 --> 1630.1499999999999
that I got that's the problem

1622.35 --> 1630.87
hey Randy hello alright yeah yeah anyway

1630.15 --> 1634.919
maybe for coming

1630.87 --> 1638.1599999999999
oh yeah no problem so what are you up to

1634.919 --> 1642.39
noella doing a bit of work this morning

1638.16 --> 1643.74
hmm nothing more I can do today I've got

1642.39 --> 1646.41
to wait for the glass to drive for a

1643.74 --> 1657.57
wallpaper so I've got the afternoon off

1646.41 --> 1660.48
all right nice so so what do you know

1657.57 --> 1665.84
anything what do I know I know my

1660.48 --> 1665.84
patience is running exceptionally him I

1666.919 --> 1671.7900000000002
think it's just the moment of the year

1669.84 --> 1674.22
or something but like even yesterday

1671.79 --> 1676.23
night was in the middle of the night I

1674.22 --> 1680.52
was supposed to be going to bed and I

1676.23 --> 1684.27
saw him live in his jet and he was just

1680.52 --> 1687.24
doing exactly the same thing they always

1684.27 --> 1690.75
do exactly the same thing I'm seriously

1687.24 --> 1693.54
starting to consider just taking a

1690.75 --> 1696.929
couple of his shows now and then

1693.54 --> 1699.75
paralleling them and then see how much

1696.929 --> 1702.6000000000001
of a difference it really is because I

1699.75 --> 1704.22
think you could almost copy/paste the

1702.6 --> 1708.24
entire show and not even see the

1704.22 --> 1711.0
difference at this point he does exactly

1708.24 --> 1714.47
the same things says exactly the same

1711.0 --> 1720.33
things shows exactly the same things

1714.47 --> 1721.429
just mind it really is like a religious

1720.33 --> 1725.1499999999999
ceremony

1721.429 --> 1727.23
it literally is a religious ceremony

1725.15 --> 1729.3600000000001
saying that they'll saying that though

1727.23 --> 1730.74
you could say that again about all the

1729.36 --> 1733.6499999999999
channels that do this kind of thing

1730.74 --> 1735.09
Simon Dan the way Eagles these programs

1733.65 --> 1736.919
are saying with conspiracy counsel say

1735.09 --> 1738.48
when Nathan even starting with a house

1736.919 --> 1742.0
keeping it literally is the same

1738.48 --> 1744.82
repetitive stuff that's not

1742.0 --> 1749.41
yeah but that's an actual question that

1744.82 --> 1751.48
we can go into you know they don't even

1749.41 --> 1753.5800000000002
do that it's always the same thing it's

1751.48 --> 1755.6200000000001
again oh look oh look oh my footage or

1753.58 --> 1758.1399999999999
see my drones going up and you can see

1755.62 --> 1759.79
the horizon and just say okay but why

1758.14 --> 1763.21
don't you see your cumulative trauma

1759.79 --> 1766.48
and why is there so little curvature

1763.21 --> 1768.79
like can't it be the optical slants you

1766.48 --> 1770.83
know explain it all from all the angles

1768.79 --> 1775.54
all the three different approaches you

1770.83 --> 1777.46
can use to explain that because slant

1775.54 --> 1780.58
why don't you come on the panel or in

1777.46 --> 1783.01
and explain it I already did that twice

1780.58 --> 1788.01
and you didn't listen I'm not gonna do

1783.01 --> 1791.68
it again you asked so sick of this guy

1788.01 --> 1794.17
so sick of it I literally have been on

1791.68 --> 1797.68
the panel twice and explained it in

1794.17 --> 1799.6000000000001
detail twice on his panel so that's just

1797.68 --> 1802.99
only the times I explained on his panel

1799.6 --> 1805.3
so leave him with 50 other times I've

1802.99 --> 1809.08
explained it in detail online and he

1805.3 --> 1813.49
just doesn't listen he can't even feed

1809.08 --> 1815.74
it back can feed back half of a sentence

1813.49 --> 1818.71
and then he just can't continue that

1815.74 --> 1820.6200000000001
anymore because he can't actually figure

1818.71 --> 1825.46
out what we're saying he can only

1820.62 --> 1828.9399999999998
literally phonetically parrot a part of

1825.46 --> 1831.52
it as he heard it like a parrot just as

1828.94 --> 1836.26
a word he's copying because he's not

1831.52 --> 1839.44
listening to what is being said and that

1836.26 --> 1845.95
is the chronic problem here and I'm so

1839.44 --> 1848.7
oh sick of it so sick if you have a

1845.95 --> 1853.06
channel called Bob the Science Guy yeah

1848.7 --> 1856.3
yeah do you think he's the absolute most

1853.06 --> 1859.21
simple globe head there ever is know

1856.3 --> 1861.19
there's always simpler globe heads oh I

1859.21 --> 1867.73
don't know I mean this guy there always

1861.19 --> 1871.1200000000001
is there's always a worse I always I

1867.73 --> 1875.27
don't think have encountered a thicker

1871.12 --> 1879.61
Globa seriously yep with no thicker

1875.27 --> 1881.27
the crust and that molten iron core

1879.61 --> 1886.3899999999999
haven't let you into a little secret

1881.27 --> 1890.11
hang on one sec I will share my screen I

1886.39 --> 1892.4
am I'm going to do a video later

1890.11 --> 1894.2299999999998
essentially what I'm gonna be doing is

1892.4 --> 1901.19
it's not that latter one actually so I

1894.23 --> 1908.17
wants that it's this yeah so oh by the

1901.19 --> 1911.96
way do you like this yeah yeah thanks

1908.17 --> 1916.6100000000001
it's a tribute especially for you I

1911.96 --> 1918.29
would I know I know I'm just still

1916.61 --> 1920.78
really annoyed that I was so

1918.29 --> 1923.09
interruptive if only it's just the

1920.78 --> 1926.24
perfectionist in me I guess if only I

1923.09 --> 1928.309
had managed to just shut up a few left

1926.24 --> 1930.17
seconds longer and let him finish his

1928.309 --> 1932.12
diarrhea dumps every single time before

1930.17 --> 1937.25
I flushed him and then would have he

1932.12 --> 1938.9899999999998
been even better speak it is speaking of

1937.25 --> 1943.34
diarrhea time see literally nearly

1938.99 --> 1945.89
choked on his own diarrhea vomit when he

1943.34 --> 1947.8999999999999
was debating that oh I'm gonna do a

1945.89 --> 1950.1200000000001
video about that as well I'm actually

1947.9 --> 1952.6100000000001
combining two I might actually do comes

1950.12 --> 1954.86
conspiracy cats and Bob the science guy

1952.61 --> 1957.53
for being the complete idiots that they

1954.86 --> 1963.76
are in one video might be with him worth

1957.53 --> 1965.809
doing actually but I even to this new

1963.76 --> 1969.67
observations with a p900

1965.809 --> 1973.07
and basically he filmed in the distance

1969.67 --> 1975.5900000000001
an oil platform and the distance was

1973.07 --> 1977.03
9.41 miles away he shows him set his

1975.59 --> 1978.9499999999998
camera off it's a foot off the ground

1977.03 --> 1980.1399999999999
the even states in his video that he's

1978.95 --> 1983.48
one foot off the ground

1980.14 --> 1984.89
he then zooms into this oil platform you

1983.48 --> 1987.26
see it perfectly well there's no

1984.89 --> 1989.39
problems with her and if she does yes

1987.26 --> 1991.309
that's Flat Earth you know so could you

1989.39 --> 1992.5400000000002
zoom in a little bit on the tax because

1991.309 --> 1994.16
of this yeah I'll get to that in a

1992.54 --> 1996.23
moment I will get to that ourselves I'll

1994.16 --> 1997.73
just I'll increase it in a minute but

1996.23 --> 2000.76
I'm just letting you know the the

1997.73 --> 2002.65
background so apparently outer space had

2000.76 --> 2004.84
been trained to contact this Bob the

2002.65 --> 2006.1000000000001
Science Guy on a different platform and

2004.84 --> 2007.87
they've had a bit of back and forth and

2006.1 --> 2008.8899999999999
Bob then they started to look at his

2007.87 --> 2011.86
work

2008.89 --> 2016.0
so in his wisdom prob being the science

2011.86 --> 2017.02
guy he he puts a video together that

2016.0 --> 2019.21
kind well

2017.02 --> 2021.34
that is trying to debunk the observation

2019.21 --> 2023.8600000000001
right and he failed miserably

2021.34 --> 2026.29
right so within like two minutes I had

2023.86 --> 2029.62
nearly straight away what he was trying

2026.29 --> 2032.05
to do and how he was doing stuff forget

2029.62 --> 2033.6399999999999
what I thought because basically this is

2032.05 --> 2037.54
what I'm gonna go into in the video but

2033.64 --> 2040.5400000000002
this is his answer essentially right

2037.54 --> 2042.49
Bob the science guy this is this is his

2040.54 --> 2048.55
response right because what he does is

2042.49 --> 2051.85
he he he puts the observer high as six

2048.55 --> 2054.52
feet right in in his video so above the

2051.85 --> 2056.649
science guy says that outer arms was at

2054.52 --> 2057.94
six feet the distance was nine point

2056.649 --> 2060.669
four miles the hidden should be

2057.94 --> 2063.2200000000003
essentially twenty feet right however

2060.669 --> 2065.62
did more accurate and reasonable and

2063.22 --> 2067.3599999999997
obvious thing he should have done was

2065.62 --> 2068.7999999999997
put it at wonderful observation in high

2067.36 --> 2071.9500000000003
because that was where the bloody camera

2068.8 --> 2075.07
was right so it goes that he does this

2071.95 --> 2076.6589999999997
ten minute video about this six foot

2075.07 --> 2079.0
observation as opposed to the one for

2076.659 --> 2082.929
observation and this is his response

2079.0 --> 2085.5
went to my response to him but he says

2082.929 --> 2088.57
I'll post here why I posted on my thread

2085.5 --> 2091.36
Thank You Ramsey for all you for all you

2088.57 --> 2094.1690000000003
do to prove the globe right okay never

2091.36 --> 2097.75
mind and to use a curved calculator

2094.169 --> 2101.02
while you're at it explain how I preach

2097.75 --> 2104.17
reproduced the his photo with a six foot

2101.02 --> 2108.64
observation how seriously did he

2104.17 --> 2110.41
actually just say that did he actually

2108.64 --> 2111.66
just say those words add a lot of words

2110.41 --> 2114.43
that's to come out of this guy's mouth

2111.66 --> 2116.62
whilst you're at it explain how I

2114.43 --> 2119.02
reproduced his photo with a six foot

2116.62 --> 2121.0899999999997
observation hey well why do you think

2119.02 --> 2123.79
Bob because you gave him a higher

2121.09 --> 2125.53
elevation to match your maths if you'd

2123.79 --> 2126.82
have put it at one thought you'd have

2125.53 --> 2129.3100000000004
sinned that they would have been forty

2126.82 --> 2131.86
six feet of hidden so it was awful

2129.31 --> 2133.66
hidden but he didn't match so what you

2131.86 --> 2134.98
did you got you little scale out and you

2133.66 --> 2136.54
got your little scale unimagined you

2134.98 --> 2138.46
little man in you Merc Timor he works

2136.54 --> 2139.9
out that he was six foot tall and then

2138.46 --> 2142.0
you worked out where the curve couch

2139.9 --> 2142.33
should be and it matched your math when

2142.0 --> 2144.79
you

2142.33 --> 2146.62
in that 6-foot observation high but it

2144.79 --> 2148.87
didn't match your math when you put him

2146.62 --> 2150.7599999999998
at 1 foot because at 1/4 that would have

2148.87 --> 2152.2599999999998
been 44 foot hidden which would have

2150.76 --> 2156.19
meant that it would have entirely

2152.26 --> 2158.17
debunked the observation and he wouldn't

2156.19 --> 2160.84
been able to prove it in a globe model

2158.17 --> 2162.94
you complete auto Berk

2160.84 --> 2164.53
what then can't be can you actually

2162.94 --> 2166.63
believe that he actually said this

2164.53 --> 2168.73
whilst you're at explain how I

2166.63 --> 2171.73
reproduced his photo with his six Wubbzy

2168.73 --> 2175.18
observation airy mmm nothing bothers

2171.73 --> 2178.12
nothing bother say surprise me he was at

2175.18 --> 2180.3399999999997
one port so he had to increase so

2178.12 --> 2182.35
basically he obviously put it in at one

2180.34 --> 2184.2400000000002
foot and it didn't match so then he's

2182.35 --> 2186.16
gotten to two for observation three foot

2184.24 --> 2188.89
for foot five foot six foot when he

2186.16 --> 2190.6299999999997
finally got it to match he then decided

2188.89 --> 2194.44
that he's gonna do a six foot

2190.63 --> 2197.44
observation a so that it matches the

2194.44 --> 2201.19
results mm-hmm and this is supposed to

2197.44 --> 2203.77
be some science guy yes Bob the science

2201.19 --> 2204.94
guy I mean somebody is come on it said

2203.77 --> 2210.64
this science guy

2204.94 --> 2213.91
DRDO guy come on so is he a scientist is

2210.64 --> 2216.3399999999997
he a teacher my conspiracy katsuro so

2213.91 --> 2219.46
reliable oh I'm gonna rip him such a new

2216.34 --> 2222.1000000000004
one with it did you know something if

2219.46 --> 2224.28
this if this if read rhetoric or slash

2222.1 --> 2227.5299999999997
Paul Cain had actually wrote these words

2224.28 --> 2228.82
they would be cringing in their pants

2227.53 --> 2230.38
right now because they wouldn't have

2228.82 --> 2232.1800000000003
believed they actually wrote it for the

2230.38 --> 2234.36
first part they wouldn't believe they

2232.18 --> 2236.46
actually the words came out of the mouth

2234.36 --> 2241.21
it's so stupid

2236.46 --> 2243.25
you'd have to actually see it for what

2241.21 --> 2244.7200000000003
it is first I think that this Bob the

2243.25 --> 2246.7
science guy might be one of these

2244.72 --> 2248.7099999999996
persons that is just in the moment

2246.7 --> 2252.46
completely convinced some of themselves

2248.71 --> 2254.83
try to improvise whatever psychological

2252.46 --> 2257.83
tactic they can to make themselves look

2254.83 --> 2260.59
victorious and they just don't read what

2257.83 --> 2263.41
they write afterwards to analyze it ever

2260.59 --> 2266.02
it could be one of these guys which is

2263.41 --> 2270.3399999999997
blurts out the most insane [ __ ] ever and

2266.02 --> 2273.97
just doesn't look back I absolutely lost

2270.34 --> 2275.83
for words with response here I just

2273.97 --> 2280.5699999999997
can't believe what he's actually

2275.83 --> 2283.36
oh my goodness

2280.57 --> 2284.92
so yeah so this is the kind of globe

2283.36 --> 2287.23
tactics we have to put up with

2284.92 --> 2289.15
they've given basically this this outs

2287.23 --> 2291.04
of all the outer lands a six foot

2289.15 --> 2294.55
observation hey when you see that the

2291.04 --> 2296.47
damn camera is a foot a foot off the

2294.55 --> 2298.7200000000003
water you actually see it

2296.47 --> 2301.8399999999997
he stole close to the water he could

2298.72 --> 2303.3999999999996
fall in it mm-hmm right and his guy had

2301.84 --> 2307.6600000000003
to give him a six foot observation hike

2303.4 --> 2308.98
to make it match his maths duh why do

2307.66 --> 2311.3799999999997
you think it didn't work when you put

2308.98 --> 2315.04
him at 1/4 derp because it's not a globe

2311.38 --> 2316.6
you [ __ ] and you couldn't make it match

2315.04 --> 2320.35
the observation so you have to give him

2316.6 --> 2322.72
6 for observation hey what a joker you

2320.35 --> 2325.38
don't have to make the conditions right

2322.72 --> 2327.1299999999997
to make the machination work properly

2325.38 --> 2330.1
that's literally it

2327.13 --> 2332.56
what an idiot what an absolute idiot is

2330.1 --> 2338.3199999999997
he an idiot or does he actually know and

2332.56 --> 2341.89
he's acting so stupid as to prevent mal

2338.32 --> 2343.84
in being accused of mal intent no he

2341.89 --> 2346.3599999999997
could also be acting stupid because if

2343.84 --> 2349.54
you see if he is really aware on how to

2346.36 --> 2352.15
handle these machinations then he might

2349.54 --> 2358.59
not be as stupid as he portrays himself

2352.15 --> 2362.02
to be just saying no I think he's stupid

2358.59 --> 2364.1200000000003
no doubt but I think how stupid is he

2362.02 --> 2366.55
really is he really as stupid as he

2364.12 --> 2368.47
portrays himself or is he just putting

2366.55 --> 2376.78
an extra layer on top of there as a

2368.47 --> 2379.48
defense no I believe that he believes

2376.78 --> 2380.8900000000003
that what he's done is correct he

2379.48 --> 2383.77
believes that by increasing his

2380.89 --> 2385.81
observation height to 6 feet he can then

2383.77 --> 2387.64
make it match the observation and then

2385.81 --> 2391.72
that's proof of a globe that's what he

2387.64 --> 2393.91
in his mind he actually thinks that this

2391.72 --> 2396.49
idiot that's been pulled out of some

2393.91 --> 2398.6499999999996
science lab thinks this side having this

2396.49 --> 2400.0
I have no idea I'm just presuming

2398.65 --> 2401.89
obviously cuz he's got science in his

2400.0 --> 2403.48
name you know we've got conspiracy cats

2401.89 --> 2404.83
who pretends to be a teacher although he

2403.48 --> 2407.5
doesn't ever seem to be at work

2404.83 --> 2408.33
we've got Simon's done a good one that's

2407.5 --> 2411.06
a good one

2408.33 --> 2415.17
about conspiracy cats and I'm gonna take

2411.06 --> 2418.11
a little bit of a risk and say I don't

2415.17 --> 2422.25
think he is a teacher I think he is a

2418.11 --> 2424.6800000000003
complete pathological liar that made up

2422.25 --> 2427.53
being a teacher from the start and I

2424.68 --> 2431.0699999999997
think he's very good at upholding long

2427.53 --> 2433.9500000000003
term acts and I think he isn't a teacher

2431.07 --> 2437.55
because if he is he would have showed us

2433.95 --> 2440.1
our class or his class while he was

2437.55 --> 2442.8
teaching recording it's like see this is

2440.1 --> 2446.31
my class hi this is my student and then

2442.8 --> 2449.88
have some interaction with them and yeah

2446.31 --> 2453.63
as you said he's never been at work so

2449.88 --> 2456.9300000000003
he doesn't look like a teacher how could

2453.63 --> 2460.08
a guy like that have some kind of

2456.93 --> 2463.62
authority over kids especially in those

2460.08 --> 2468.69
age categories it's not gonna work it's

2463.62 --> 2471.75
- sniffling just I don't believe he's a

2468.69 --> 2473.4
teacher I really don't I really really

2471.75 --> 2475.55
done I think he's made it up from the

2473.4 --> 2479.4300000000003
start

2475.55 --> 2481.77
yeah he's I don't know I don't know it's

2479.43 --> 2483.8999999999996
weird how Simon done came on the scene

2481.77 --> 2485.49
you know with science and his name and

2483.9 --> 2487.77
he's possibly a teacher is from the UK

2485.49 --> 2489.9599999999996
you've got conspiracy cats who also has

2487.77 --> 2492.33
supposed to be a teacher in science in

2489.96 --> 2493.53
the UK you know and then you've got this

2492.33 --> 2496.7999999999997
other guy

2493.53 --> 2498.63
Ross fat flat earth who pretends to be a

2496.8 --> 2499.71
science guy I mean if he's in his past

2498.63 --> 2503.46
video gods

2499.71 --> 2506.61
that's shield but that guy is just

2503.46 --> 2506.9700000000003
literally if he is doing it for the

2506.61 --> 2511.4300000000003
money

2506.97 --> 2516.0899999999997
he's just he's a media character that is

2511.43 --> 2519.06
pursuing a social media acting career

2516.09 --> 2521.4
and wants to present shows and hey I

2519.06 --> 2523.68
have nothing against that but it is

2521.4 --> 2527.4900000000002
obvious that he doesn't really care and

2523.68 --> 2530.1
he's just taking on subjects for views

2527.49 --> 2532.29
yeah obviously what web is the latest

2530.1 --> 2534.72
fad wherever he thinks he can sell some

2532.29 --> 2536.7
more t-shirts where he thinks he can

2534.72 --> 2538.56
subscribers that's where he comes along

2536.7 --> 2540.3599999999997
to and he thought what can be the best

2538.56 --> 2541.71
name I can think of because I'm self

2540.36 --> 2544.1400000000003
since I'm and am becoming about

2541.71 --> 2545.48
very popular and oh yeah fight the

2544.14 --> 2550.3799999999997
flutter

2545.48 --> 2553.02
let's go for that Oh what among well

2550.38 --> 2556.7400000000002
it's commercial exploitation it's just

2553.02 --> 2558.69
lying for profit that's what it comes

2556.74 --> 2562.3199999999997
down to it's been handed down like look

2558.69 --> 2565.589
well there is a lot of money in trying

2562.32 --> 2568.589
to stop the flat earthers whose

2565.589 --> 2570.96
religions are being hurt and they need

2568.589 --> 2574.2
their defenders who are in the ditch

2570.96 --> 2576.3
fighting on the rise

2574.2 --> 2578.16
don't get me wrong if I had no morals

2576.3 --> 2580.77
and I wasn't in in this for the truth

2578.16 --> 2581.8199999999997
I'd be if I'd be of empty flattered so

2580.77 --> 2583.23
because that's where you can make the

2581.82 --> 2585.06
most money you'll get the quickest

2583.23 --> 2588.119
subscribers you'll make lots of people

2585.06 --> 2590.67
giving you patreon money lots of live

2588.119 --> 2592.53
streams with people giving you a super

2590.67 --> 2594.1800000000003
chat you know because you're an anti

2592.53 --> 2596.369
flat earther and you can you know you

2594.18 --> 2598.3489999999997
can poke forum and people like to poke

2596.369 --> 2600.3900000000003
fun at flat earthers so they'll

2598.349 --> 2602.31
eventually if you want more it yeah and

2600.39 --> 2603.75
if you want to sell your soul if you

2602.31 --> 2607.109
want to sell your soul then that's the

2603.75 --> 2608.73
sort of thing you should go into if you

2607.109 --> 2609.72
actually are in it for the truth you're

2608.73 --> 2611.55
in it for the long haul

2609.72 --> 2614.339
there's no money in being a flat earth

2611.55 --> 2616.2000000000003
there is absolutely money being an anti

2614.339 --> 2618.24
flat earther so that's why all these new

2616.2 --> 2621.1499999999996
people are coming in and they're just a

2618.24 --> 2623.9399999999996
joke I mean the conspiracy cap actually

2621.15 --> 2626.58
got owned by the poll that came in

2623.94 --> 2629.88
pretending to be a flat earther and he

2626.58 --> 2633.089
had no arguments actually he literally

2629.88 --> 2634.8
got up and this poll guy completely

2633.089 --> 2637.109
owned him and he didn't even realize

2634.8 --> 2639.9300000000003
he'd been owned and then when he

2637.109 --> 2642.48
realized that he he'd actually his first

2639.93 --> 2645.1499999999996
point which was about this the the

2642.48 --> 2649.26
earthquakes and when he was actually put

2645.15 --> 2651.9900000000002
into a corner by the poll he had had to

2649.26 --> 2657.599
admit that basically it was all based on

2651.99 --> 2660.089
a priest supposed make up of the earth

2657.599 --> 2661.77
and that had that if the makeup of the

2660.089 --> 2663.96
earth was different if it had different

2661.77 --> 2665.7599999999998
layers different layer properties then

2663.96 --> 2668.099
the results wouldn't match so his entire

2665.76 --> 2670.38
argument was debunked and he literally

2668.099 --> 2672.51
debunked himself in that moment you saw

2670.38 --> 2675.119
it on his face he jumped up off the seat

2672.51 --> 2675.5690000000004
he squirmed he literally had a face like

2675.119 --> 2677.819
he was

2675.569 --> 2679.499
all flat on the floor and have a heart

2677.819 --> 2681.449
attack he didn't say a word for like

2679.499 --> 2682.799
three seconds he was stuttering he

2681.449 --> 2684.359
didn't know what so they admittedly

2682.799 --> 2686.16
knocked out yeah

2684.359 --> 2688.0789999999997
and this poll came in and he literally

2686.16 --> 2689.339
saved him saved him at the last minute

2688.079 --> 2691.289
and just changed the subject and

2689.339 --> 2694.619
conspiracy counts went yeah yeah yeah

2691.289 --> 2697.7690000000002
yeah yeah yeah and I was older that a

2694.619 --> 2700.259
gold and gold and you'd be just be bunky

2697.769 --> 2706.6499999999996
self you complete more you've got to

2700.259 --> 2708.839
show me that flips oh I'll try and find

2706.65 --> 2711.69
the exact time little thing on the clip

2708.839 --> 2713.459
well honestly I mean I've never seen him

2711.69 --> 2715.829
it was the first time he at first and

2713.459 --> 2718.8289999999997
only time he actually moved out of the

2715.829 --> 2720.059
seat he moved so fast the jumps of his

2718.829 --> 2721.739
suit he moved forward you look

2720.059 --> 2722.9990000000003
absolutely thought it was gonna have a

2721.739 --> 2725.609
heart attack there and then because he

2722.999 --> 2728.549
could see that his entire career as a

2725.609 --> 2731.249
flat earth debunker was draining from

2728.549 --> 2735.749
him like his blood was being pulled out

2731.249 --> 2737.749
of him well he probably lost focus and

2735.749 --> 2740.0989999999997
then had a panic attack

2737.749 --> 2741.8089999999997
literally that's what happens that's

2740.099 --> 2744.299
deadly with that would be another good

2741.809 --> 2746.969
shock that is when it doesn't click and

2744.299 --> 2750.329
it instead turns into a panic I've had

2746.969 --> 2752.099
been in those situations well here was

2750.329 --> 2755.059
the a with the point the point was that

2752.099 --> 2758.88
he says here we have a globe model and

2755.059 --> 2762.2690000000002
we can tell what the S waves are and the

2758.88 --> 2764.339
P waves of the the earthquake detectors

2762.269 --> 2765.7189999999996
and we get these signals back and it

2764.339 --> 2767.7889999999998
only works on a spheroid

2765.719 --> 2769.799
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah and it only

2767.789 --> 2772.1400000000003
works because of the makeup of the earth

2769.799 --> 2773.459
so different layer properties you know

2772.14 --> 2774.8089999999997
obviously you got your P waves in your s

2773.459 --> 2776.43
ways but he got them completely wrong in

2774.809 --> 2777.17
a way cuz some go through water and some

2776.43 --> 2780.1499999999996
don't

2777.17 --> 2782.4300000000003
anyway they give different results so

2780.15 --> 2784.89
basically if the earth isn't made the

2782.43 --> 2787.469
way they say it is with a solid you know

2784.89 --> 2788.8799999999997
chord Center and you know all this kinda

2787.469 --> 2791.67
layers all the way up to the top it's

2788.88 --> 2793.7690000000002
not exactly as they say then all these

2791.67 --> 2796.0190000000002
results mean nothing doesn't mean that

2793.769 --> 2799.2889999999998
it's an absolute proof of the globe at

2796.019 --> 2801.3289999999997
all right and then this pole guy said

2799.289 --> 2803.009
well you do realize that we've only ever

2801.329 --> 2804.8390000000004
been down like seven and a half miles

2803.009 --> 2806.91
under the cross then we have no idea

2804.839 --> 2808.709
what's beneath there and then conspiracy

2806.91 --> 2809.22
cat sees like well yeah suppose you put

2808.709 --> 2811.3489999999997
it out

2809.22 --> 2813.1499999999996
yeah I mean you know we're wrong with

2811.349 --> 2815.25
our assumption about what the earth is

2813.15 --> 2817.98
consisted of and how it's made up then

2815.25 --> 2819.599
yeah then this argument would fall flat

2817.98 --> 2821.28
on its face and he literally then

2819.599 --> 2822.81
realized what he was saying and was

2821.28 --> 2825.69
having a heart attack right at that

2822.81 --> 2827.0099999999998
moment and it was like yeah you just did

2825.69 --> 2832.19
funky South you clown

2827.01 --> 2839.13
oh god the bats

2832.19 --> 2841.68
debunked Ivanka's we're not even at the

2839.13 --> 2846.59
point of debunking or proving anymore

2841.68 --> 2851.19
really I think that face roughly ended a

2846.59 --> 2854.58
year ago yeah I mean after we discovered

2851.19 --> 2857.4900000000002
how curvature is not curvature I think

2854.58 --> 2862.2599999999998
that after that point the ballers went

2857.49 --> 2866.9399999999996
so maniacally insane over having having

2862.26 --> 2870.119
their very sensitive base foundational

2866.94 --> 2873.39
belief uncovered like that that they all

2870.119 --> 2876.599
turned into mental gymnastics mode from

2873.39 --> 2879.5989999999997
that point on and just went on complete

2876.599 --> 2883.0800000000004
denial beyond anything it's no longer

2879.599 --> 2885.7200000000003
just repeating what they've learned

2883.08 --> 2888.69
now it's they construct the lies to

2885.72 --> 2889.589
evade the truth themselves well here's

2888.69 --> 2892.619
the problem here

2889.589 --> 2894.75
conspiracy Cass isn't a debater right

2892.619 --> 2896.19
he'll have a talk with people I didn't

2894.75 --> 2898.89
come across very nice but he isn't

2896.19 --> 2901.05
actually a debater he has an idea about

2898.89 --> 2902.7599999999998
what could prove the globe and then

2901.05 --> 2904.7400000000002
he'll put it to you and then he'll maybe

2902.76 --> 2906.7200000000003
gets you know some feedback and he's

2904.74 --> 2908.8199999999997
normally used to getting feedback that's

2906.72 --> 2910.7099999999996
all positive he isn't used to actually

2908.82 --> 2914.07
getting feedback that counters his claim

2910.71 --> 2916.13
so when this poll put it to him that

2914.07 --> 2918.599
essentially we don't know what's beneath

2916.13 --> 2920.339
seven and a half miles and actually when

2918.599 --> 2922.8
they actually drilled down there we

2920.339 --> 2925.109
found water which they would expect him

2922.8 --> 2926.76
to find at that level easy to find any

2925.109 --> 2929.19
water there so obviously all those

2926.76 --> 2931.32
preconceived ideas how the earth is

2929.19 --> 2934.17
shaped and what's underneath it could be

2931.32 --> 2935.9100000000003
completely wrong and he didn't have a

2934.17 --> 2938.67
response to that and he actually went

2935.91 --> 2940.3199999999997
into what we call flat earth mode where

2938.67 --> 2942.66
he was actually being honest for a

2940.32 --> 2944.6400000000003
moment and he actually said yeah

2942.66 --> 2946.6499999999996
Julie said well oh yeah well I suppose

2944.64 --> 2949.65
if you put it like that then then this

2946.65 --> 2951.54
you know wouldn't work exactly as I just

2949.65 --> 2954.39
showed it you know it wouldn't work this

2951.54 --> 2956.52
way and when he realized he'd conceded a

2954.39 --> 2958.94
point and that this other guy actually

2956.52 --> 2961.02
had a point and he was being honest

2958.94 --> 2963.87
that's when he realized that his

2961.02 --> 2965.67
fallacious argument had no water it was

2963.87 --> 2968.13
completely dead in the water there and

2965.67 --> 2970.83
then he'll never ever ever be able to

2968.13 --> 2973.1400000000003
show that as proof in any other debate

2970.83 --> 2974.64
going forward from now on not only did

2973.14 --> 2976.68
he bunk himself with it because he'd

2974.64 --> 2978.48
actually conceded to himself and no

2976.68 --> 2980.16
Globa come see they don't do that they

2978.48 --> 2981.72
will never ever ever know I think that's

2980.16 --> 2987.24
actually commend the war

2981.72 --> 2989.0699999999997
well it's commendable me being yes he

2987.24 --> 2994.2
went into mentally honest mode for a

2989.07 --> 2996.1200000000003
minute yes he's not trained like the

2994.2 --> 2998.43
slash bar canes and the Reds rhetorics

2996.12 --> 3000.56
and the Shawn hoods and the Miles Davis

2998.43 --> 3003.3199999999997
is these guys that never concede a point

3000.56 --> 3005.14
ever you could literally say the Sun is

3003.32 --> 3007.6400000000003
orange and they would say it was blue

3005.14 --> 3010.43
right if it was a if it was gonna be a

3007.64 --> 3012.41
win for them right and it doesn't matter

3010.43 --> 3014.18
you know it doesn't matter to them they

3012.41 --> 3015.92
would be faced with the absolute

3014.18 --> 3016.7599999999998
clearest proof of anything and they

3015.92 --> 3019.4
would still deny it

3016.76 --> 3021.8900000000003
whereas conspiracy cats isn't in that

3019.4 --> 3024.2000000000003
mindset yet but you'll get there but

3021.89 --> 3026.3799999999997
this one point about this the P waves

3024.2 --> 3030.31
and the S waves and and you know

3026.38 --> 3033.08
detecting earthquakes his holy grail of

3030.31 --> 3035.12
proof that the earth is a sphere he

3033.08 --> 3036.98
debunks himself on his very first proper

3035.12 --> 3038.63
debate and he wasn't even debating a

3036.98 --> 3040.13
flat earth through his debate in a globe

3038.63 --> 3041.69
earth or pretending to be a fight over

3040.13 --> 3045.26
who wrecked him could you might be

3041.69 --> 3046.55
debating me yes always yes that's really

3045.26 --> 3051.1400000000003
like an accident

3046.55 --> 3056.7200000000003
yeah yeah this other global workplace

3051.14 --> 3059.27
mishap you couldn't I mean they gave him

3056.72 --> 3061.43
the easiest targets at first ever debate

3059.27 --> 3063.14
you could ever think of which is another

3061.43 --> 3065.5099999999998
global birth they're pretending to be a

3063.14 --> 3068.08
flat earther and they the other guys

3065.51 --> 3071.84
still wrecked him on every point on

3068.08 --> 3073.2799999999997
every point that you made right yeah and

3071.84 --> 3075.2000000000003
it was just so comical I mean I'm

3073.28 --> 3076.21
thinking when it turned out this guy was

3075.2 --> 3078.2599999999998
a pole

3076.21 --> 3082.2200000000003
could you imagine if he'd been debating

3078.26 --> 3083.8100000000004
Nathan or Antonia you or me and he

3082.22 --> 3088.1
brought these arguments he had have been

3083.81 --> 3091.1
ripped a new one I just would have

3088.1 --> 3092.36
walked away and the other guy you know I

3091.1 --> 3095.18
mean the second point that they brought

3092.36 --> 3096.9500000000003
up about the my observation in this

3095.18 --> 3099.47
looking at the lighthouse and stuff

3096.95 --> 3101.1499999999996
the guy was spot-on again he literally

3099.47 --> 3102.56
said we don't know what the geography of

3101.15 --> 3104.48
the land is there you don't know what

3102.56 --> 3106.13
there's the shape of the water is and

3104.48 --> 3107.57
that you know they land underneath its

3106.13 --> 3108.59
Apocrypha of the land and you don't know

3107.57 --> 3112.46
what the tides are doing

3108.59 --> 3115.46
he was absolutely [ __ ] spot on it was

3112.46 --> 3116.96
genuinely 100% but on aft on the full

3115.46 --> 3118.28
video about it I've not actually put it

3116.96 --> 3120.71
all together yet but I've got all the

3118.28 --> 3122.3900000000003
pieces in place for that as well I mean

3120.71 --> 3126.77
he's absolutely spot-on

3122.39 --> 3128.6299999999997
that it is it so it's and he didn't even

3126.77 --> 3130.0099999999998
know he was being debunked at the time

3128.63 --> 3132.11
and this other guy it was just being it

3130.01 --> 3135.8900000000003
just you know pretending to be a flat

3132.11 --> 3138.8
earther but the guy was right that's a

3135.89 --> 3141.5299999999997
birthday yes cliff oh did you find it

3138.8 --> 3143.69
yet yeah well old I know it's I was like

3141.53 --> 3145.73
the clip right all right once that'll

3143.69 --> 3152.69
happen right hold the fort down for two

3145.73 --> 3157.2
minutes one fan going over an hour time

3152.69 --> 3159.46
has flied flown sorry

3157.2 --> 3161.77
so let's see

3159.46 --> 3164.71
you know how people shop mostly the same

3161.77 --> 3172.2599999999998
people band a couple here and there

3164.71 --> 3179.01
so Nathan Oakley earlier blue data

3172.26 --> 3182.5200000000004
comfort know some tinted monocle hmm

3179.01 --> 3182.5200000000004
chuckling say in

3185.57 --> 3188.26
or she

3190.25 --> 3197.48
some baller trolls that are trying to

3194.65 --> 3201.4700000000003
switch I don't know what they're doing

3197.48 --> 3204.56
they're just being idiots yeah that's it

3201.47 --> 3213.1699999999996
I think I'll wait getting ELLs there

3204.56 --> 3217.19
lucky whines juice mr. Rick's

3213.17 --> 3219.65
j-mac oh sure oh six you know Travis

3217.19 --> 3222.02
cloud yeah thanks guys for joining I

3219.65 --> 3225.109
hope you like the show so far started

3222.02 --> 3228.05
out a bit rough but Randi Kaye mom and

3225.109 --> 3231.3489999999997
lighten the spirits on my side at least

3228.05 --> 3236.57
with this crazy story but what happened

3231.349 --> 3238.82
with that flat or conspiracy cats oh I

3236.57 --> 3242.54
got a hundred a for watching

3238.82 --> 3246.099
that is awesome so yeah the show is

3242.54 --> 3249.17
gonna go on but can you play this in

3246.099 --> 3256.31
person if I send you this link home

3261.77 --> 3268.19
the you know you can play it with volume

3264.89 --> 3269.42
current now do have a time-stamped yes I

3268.19 --> 3274.67
do

3269.42 --> 3278.589
it's 42:22 okay so you're looking for

3274.67 --> 3282.4
conspiracy he's in the top 40 to 22 and

3278.589 --> 3286.599
he's in the top left conspiracy cat

3282.4 --> 3286.599
watch him [ __ ] he's pumped

3286.75 --> 3295.83
okay I'll start at 40 to 70 yep how long

3292.18 --> 3298.39
is it oh it's only like 15 seconds

3295.83 --> 3301.98
Tenzin its no poor yeah then there won't

3298.39 --> 3306.04
be any copyright strike in that sense

3301.98 --> 3313.53
okay let me see how shall I present this

3306.04 --> 3313.5299999999997
I need a third screen I think hold on

3321.1 --> 3326.25
no damn it I hadn't eaten

3332.79 --> 3341.2799999999997
I mean I've never seen anybody squirm as

3335.76 --> 3343.2900000000004
watching her life this is the point

3341.28 --> 3345.8100000000004
where he literally debunks his whole

3343.29 --> 3349.2
claim it debunk his claim in like 15

3345.81 --> 3351.12
seconds and you see the blood draining

3349.2 --> 3367.2599999999998
from his face when he realizes what he's

3351.12 --> 3373.71
done damn it I don't know no window

3367.26 --> 3376.19
captured that what's the one right yeah

3373.71 --> 3379.56
I think I got it ah thank God

3376.19 --> 3380.61
okay now have to integrate this sorry

3379.56 --> 3387.74
could take a while

3380.61 --> 3390.1800000000003
but I'm well underway place that

3387.74 --> 3391.7099999999996
presentation mode

3390.18 --> 3403.77
[Music]

3391.71 --> 3410.089
at source scene oh sorry guys yeah keep

3403.77 --> 3410.089
on talking I'm still working to fix this

3419.18 --> 3423.359
yeah so you guys are gonna love this

3421.26 --> 3428.46
when you see it you literally watch him

3423.359 --> 3430.8289999999997
Lou he debunks his own claim and he

3428.46 --> 3432.329
screams so badly it's unbelievable he

3430.829 --> 3435.42
jumps off the seat he doesn't know what

3432.329 --> 3437.2200000000003
to do with himself is so you can see his

3435.42 --> 3439.8
mind is working at a hundred miles an

3437.22 --> 3454.5
hour how am I gonna get out of it then

3439.8 --> 3456.9

3454.5 --> 3461.63
you doing it Owen I changed the wrong

3456.9 --> 3461.63
thing that's really freaking annoying

3463.069 --> 3467.43
yeah that's the tricky thing if you

3465.45 --> 3472.4399999999996
change something if you change the place

3467.43 --> 3476.22
of a window then suddenly yeah you can't

3472.44 --> 3479.46
undo it it's ridiculous that's what one

3476.22 --> 3483.839
of the big downsides of OBS is that's

3479.46 --> 3485.91
very convenient but if you accidentally

3483.839 --> 3489.27
change something in the wrong way then

3485.91 --> 3491.2799999999997
you have to manually fix it there's no

3489.27 --> 3498.77
way other way to do it and that just

3491.28 --> 3503.52
sucks okay okay I'm ready to present now

3498.77 --> 3507.359
okay so there you go scream what

3503.52 --> 3508.89
conspiracy Cats top left oh you see his

3507.359 --> 3512.25
face with these two big guys go I

3508.89 --> 3513.3489999999997
thought you said no yes I'm not all

3512.25 --> 3516.42
right

3513.349 --> 3517.8590000000004
so what basically what I'm saying is the

3516.42 --> 3519.51
internal structure of the earth you are

3517.859 --> 3520.98
right that the internal structure the

3519.51 --> 3522.4500000000003
earth is going to affect what pattern we

3520.98 --> 3524.16
see on the surface right so this

3522.45 --> 3525.21
structure of the intention to this was

3524.16 --> 3531.75
different mean we

3525.21 --> 3534.93
yeah sorry he can be explained so with

3531.75 --> 3537.9
different areas of different density of

3534.93 --> 3541.43
different material in the in the core

3537.9 --> 3544.17
even on flat plane I can see I mean that

3541.43 --> 3547.109
model probably works

3544.17 --> 3550.01
I don't hesitate there's work just one

3547.109 --> 3553.14
explanation it doesn't it doesn't prove

3550.01 --> 3556.65
the earth is round it just shows that it

3553.14 --> 3559.02
effects our own but it doesn't tell me

3556.65 --> 3570.21
it doesn't tell us that he'd used round

3559.02 --> 3572.04
in fact seconds so he literally you can

3570.21 --> 3573.78
see him admitting yeah you're right if

3572.04 --> 3575.7
the internal structure of the earth is

3573.78 --> 3577.4700000000003
different than then correct we would

3575.7 --> 3579.2999999999997
have we would have different results and

3577.47 --> 3580.68
then he sits forward and he moves

3579.3 --> 3586.4700000000003
forward and he doesn't know what's there

3580.68 --> 3588.4199999999996
then he goes he goes yeah and he sees

3586.47 --> 3590.3089999999997
big eyeballs the biggest eyeballs you

3588.42 --> 3593.79
ever seen he's completely every desire

3590.309 --> 3597.059
is so funny yeah that was a good moment

3593.79 --> 3598.859
oh good I want to eat play again

3597.059 --> 3601.579
good you got to watch it it just just 10

3598.859 --> 3607.819
seconds for me okay

3601.579 --> 3607.819
hilarious get in here again

3615.99 --> 3623.6299999999997
all right what was the time again 42:22

3625.85 --> 3632.16
no yeah I know all right so what

3630.54 --> 3633.6
basically what I'm saying is it the

3632.16 --> 3635.2799999999997
internal structure of the earth you are

3633.6 --> 3636.75
right that the internal structure the

3635.28 --> 3638.2200000000003
earth is going to affect what pattern we

3636.75 --> 3639.9
see on the surface right so this

3638.22 --> 3645.72
structure the intern sure this was

3639.9 --> 3649.77
different mean we yeah so he can be

3645.72 --> 3664.41
explained so with different areas of

3649.77 --> 3666.77
different density or different [ __ ] he

3664.41 --> 3669.24
actually moved off the sea which was

3666.77 --> 3670.5
showing how uncomfortable he was within

3669.24 --> 3672.8399999999997
himself you know if you were if you do

3670.5 --> 3674.88
body language and stuff like this for

3672.84 --> 3676.65
the entire I mean this is like 42

3674.88 --> 3678.9300000000003
minutes in he hasn't moved off his seat

3676.65 --> 3681.15
he's been completely relaxed sat there

3678.93 --> 3684.45
with his can of lager between his

3681.15 --> 3687.39
testicles he's not moved at all and then

3684.45 --> 3689.64
the minute he's actually admitting that

3687.39 --> 3691.2
his argument is fallacious and can be

3689.64 --> 3693.5099999999998
ripped apart by the simple fact that

3691.2 --> 3694.5
nobody knows what the structure of the

3693.51 --> 3696.9900000000002
earth is made up

3694.5 --> 3698.91
that's the minute that he literally

3696.99 --> 3701.04
squirms in his chair he moves he's

3698.91 --> 3703.29
jumping all around the place his face is

3701.04 --> 3705.93
ashen you know complete body language

3703.29 --> 3709.5299999999997
change telling me that he was completely

3705.93 --> 3712.319
wrecked himself well he did accidentally

3709.53 --> 3718.9900000000002
put himself in a corner that's for sure

3712.319 --> 3721.119
and he didn't realize it though that's

3718.99 --> 3724.569
funny when you stuck to the discipline

3721.119 --> 3727.059
of mental gymnastics I think they I

3724.569 --> 3728.799
think those two idiots beneath Lovelace

3727.059 --> 3730.8390000000004
engineer and Steve I think they're

3728.799 --> 3732.64
pretty disappointed with him at this

3730.839 --> 3736.349
moment you know that they're looking at

3732.64 --> 3742.109
him as if to say what have you just done

3736.349 --> 3742.1090000000004
yeah he didn't he didn't do it right

3742.44 --> 3753.819
does that mean you're not supposed to

3745.63 --> 3755.859
admit the truth right so what we're

3753.819 --> 3759.549
doing now we gonna go over and watch bit

3755.859 --> 3766.15
of Nathan's that's like a reload right

3759.549 --> 3769.18

3766.15 --> 3771.599
city and see if I can find myself a

3769.18 --> 3771.5989999999997
