6.78 --> 41.42
[Music]

37.27 --> 44.690000000000005
good morning welcome to flat earther

41.42 --> 49.370000000000005
earlybird number 103 I'm your host

44.69 --> 53.059
Arwen and today he's been bit like

49.37 --> 57.769
yesterday it is no no it's actually

53.059 --> 59.419999999999995
quite different it's been cloudy I don't

57.769 --> 63.649
know if there's even chemtrails I can

59.42 --> 67.67
see there so a gray suit it has rained a

63.649 --> 71.56
little in the morning it's not really

67.67 --> 71.56
cold it's not really warm either

81.88 --> 85.56
yeah that's it

88.649 --> 91.649
so

94.71 --> 105.22999999999999
you guys all do it Steve he has a calm

104.67 --> 110.64
down

105.23 --> 118.55000000000001
then Winfield Shane Walter nothing

110.64 --> 118.55
happening it was a and salt at 667

128.53 --> 135.099
yeah you've been going a little bit over

130.81 --> 137.05
the top my friend so

135.099 --> 140.11999999999998
I hope you're gonna

137.05 --> 143.36
keep Guinea grip

140.12 --> 147.459
because like this panic hyping [ __ ]

143.36 --> 147.459
that's just really annoying

147.7 --> 151.81
hello 101 rock hound

163.34 --> 175.01
appearances can be deceiving you know me

171.08 --> 178.459
I'm just a person nathan is also just a

175.01 --> 180.59
person he does things how he does it

178.459 --> 184.78
and then see what he's doing wrong

180.59 --> 184.78
really and you can see it

190.83 --> 199.08
I listened back yesterday to the Hangout

196.74 --> 201.57000000000002
I did with constants such a great sport

199.08 --> 206.85000000000002
constants and thought like [ __ ]

201.57 --> 209.23999999999998
I don't like hearing myself like this at

206.85 --> 209.23999999999998
all

211.03 --> 215.43
again is this what I'm supposed to be

213.25 --> 215.43
doing

222.51 --> 229.26
it's not like I was wrong but it makes

228.18 --> 232.29000000000002
me feel sick

229.26 --> 236.34
quite literally actually I've I've not

232.29 --> 239.29999999999998
been feeling good today I drank a couple

236.34 --> 242.06900000000002
of beers again yesterday was kind of fun

239.3 --> 244.11
then I woke up really early and it's

242.069 --> 245.95899999999997
like you know this is not good I don't

244.11 --> 250.049
feel good at all

245.959 --> 254.22
and I even had pretty bad headache so I

250.049 --> 257.519
basically drank some tea oh yeah I

254.22 --> 260.549
talked a little too flat earth Fokker in

257.519 --> 263.88
this chat and benefi back and forth and

260.549 --> 266.52
one of those hang out and then tried to

263.88 --> 268.5
get back to sleep again that works but

266.52 --> 270.33
it's almost like I didn't sleep really

268.5 --> 274.26
in the nine yeah I've was asleep but I

270.33 --> 278.03
didn't rest and I got some of that back

274.26 --> 281.03999999999996
in the morning and also took a hand off

278.03 --> 286.19
good organic supplements to kind of help

281.04 --> 286.19
I still don't feel good

294.06 --> 300.78000000000003
in retrospect like the Hangout before

297.03 --> 305.46
the number 101 I really like that one

300.78 --> 311.19
I really did it was very productive good

305.46 --> 313.5
subjects nice close to home and that's

311.19 --> 321.6
good stuff I like that I like that I

313.5 --> 323.43
want that you know I in the world what's

321.6 --> 330.29
happening out there what's really going

323.43 --> 330.29
on it just makes me sick

335.63 --> 342.44
I'm not gonna try to be an apologist for

338.66 --> 345.02000000000004
any of these wrongdoers there are

342.44 --> 348.65
everywhere it's on all sides that's one

345.02 --> 351.91999999999996
of the more creepy realizations like no

348.65 --> 354.4
matter the country no matter the group

351.92 --> 360.05
you're gonna point at it there is

354.4 --> 363.62
darkness in there and they are ruining

360.05 --> 365.72
things so it's almost like what's the

363.62 --> 369.02
point to even picking one group and

365.72 --> 373.85
targeting them when all the opposition's

369.02 --> 377.33
to that group will be well just as bad

373.85 --> 382.31
it it's not even about who is worse more

377.33 --> 386.99
about who has the upper hand I guess and

382.31 --> 389.41
it just makes me feel sick I don't like

386.99 --> 389.41
it at all

392.43 --> 401.73
try not to get into whining complaining

395.26 --> 401.73
mode about it why can't we just

404.58 --> 411.69899999999996
we left to our devices and just live a

407.47 --> 414.0
normal life not having all this [ __ ] to

411.699 --> 414.0
deal with

416.34 --> 418.88
yes

421.09 --> 425.19
gonna be rounding today I hope

430.11 --> 440.84000000000003
I am miss McCloud not first but yeah

456.879 --> 466.189
I've been watching a little bit of yeah

460.119 --> 470.02900000000005
channel fiafia no more news and guys

466.189 --> 475.41900000000004
like really really on top of Israel and

470.029 --> 479.179
the Israel lobby AIPAC all that and he

475.419 --> 481.579
yeah watch the video not all of it

479.179 --> 484.279
because it's just so big so long and so

481.579 --> 487.969
kind of repetitive but he he really

484.279 --> 491.089
shows how Alex Jones changed over the

487.969 --> 496.909
years in his stance and basically went

491.089 --> 501.469
on the Israel lobby defensive you could

496.909 --> 503.68899999999996
say it's don't even know

501.469 --> 506.779
how bad it really is because he does

503.689 --> 511.389
seem to overemphasize the little

506.779 --> 511.389
exaggerate maybe it's just such a mess

517.42 --> 522.15
let's not get into it too much it's just

534.51 --> 542.8
yeah that's right unsalted that's right

538.29 --> 545.4699999999999
I don't I don't want

542.8 --> 550.26
because again like I said right before

545.47 --> 553.26
this every group every group has

550.26 --> 556.26
absolute bad sides and every group are

553.26 --> 556.26
abusing

557.03 --> 563.78
a victim status against another bad

560.57 --> 566.6600000000001
group to try and gain more grip over the

563.78 --> 569.3199999999999
minds of the people and they all do it

566.66 --> 574.1
all of them all of them

569.32 --> 577.69
it's a giant pecking order it really is

574.1 --> 582.47
and it makes me sick it feels it feels

577.69 --> 584.45
non-human all of it where's the humanity

582.47 --> 587.9
really if all you're doing is just

584.45 --> 590.69
trying to abuse whatever social state is

587.9 --> 594.01
to try and get more power it's it is

590.69 --> 594.0100000000001
that the only thing really

598.95 --> 601.5500000000001
you know

607.24 --> 610.24
please

610.31 --> 617.449
please talk about dehumanization look

615.259 --> 619.22
this is exactly the type of [ __ ] I was

617.449 --> 622.569
talking about you're gonna be timed out

619.22 --> 622.5690000000001
just for something that

637.91 --> 644.389
now it is Dominion

640.93 --> 646.7589999999999
that the experiments did work

644.389 --> 650.0790000000001
and they didn't admit that they didn't

646.759 --> 653.7090000000001
work that was a cut out timing thingy

650.079 --> 657.069
there was a big aftermath after that and

653.709 --> 662.0889999999999
yeah that was not part of the movie

657.069 --> 664.16
behind the curve it's been widely

662.089 --> 666.35
discussed look this movie is pretty damn

664.16 --> 670.069
old by now okay and so much has happened

666.35 --> 675.2900000000001
since and keep on claiming that [ __ ]

670.069 --> 677.8689999999999
that's just [ __ ] they did work out

675.29 --> 680.259
and besides when all of that happened we

677.869 --> 685.0400000000001
had no real conceptualization of

680.259 --> 686.869
obstruction of perspective in the

685.04 --> 689.679
limited viewing angle and the

686.869 --> 692.6
diffraction limit of lenses and cameras

689.679 --> 694.73
we didn't have any conception of that we

692.6 --> 701.899
basically were still figuring that one

694.73 --> 702.619
out so yeah it's a free setting that's

701.899 --> 706.36
kind of funny

702.619 --> 710.029
I was watching a bit of Owen Benjamin

706.36 --> 713.509
yesterday he talked a lot about flatter

710.029 --> 717.799
a big segment I I linked it in the Skype

713.509 --> 719.749
chat hopes people watched it was really

717.799 --> 721.999
interesting and he really the funny

719.749 --> 724.4590000000001
thing was he went on about gravity and

721.999 --> 727.999
like what is gravity why can nobody

724.459 --> 731.9889999999999
explain it well Owen Benjamin you want

727.999 --> 736.369
somebody to explain gravity to you right

731.989 --> 738.5590000000001
here you know I get gravity I get it

736.369 --> 742.1890000000001
from every perspective I get the

738.559 --> 746.019
psychological elements how people get

742.189 --> 746.019
stuck up in it

746.25 --> 752.94
I understand it is an aberration and

748.53 --> 758.73
what that means I was on that side I

752.94 --> 762.45
defended gravity if you want to get

758.73 --> 774.1800000000001
gravity talk to me probably nothing but

762.45 --> 776.76
yeah I get gravity and is good because a

774.18 --> 780.12
lot of all it they don't get it because

776.76 --> 783.09
they don't they can't touch the complete

780.12 --> 786.12
picture they're just staring at the dead

783.09 --> 788.37
center point of the aberration see all

786.12 --> 791.19
the elements surrounding it combined and

788.37 --> 793.2
then they look at that hole and they say

791.19 --> 796.0200000000001
it must be there it must be there

793.2 --> 798.0600000000001
because everything points at that there

796.02 --> 803.1899999999999
must be something there even though we

798.06 --> 805.17
can actually point at it even though we

803.19 --> 808.83
can't actually scientifically prove it

805.17 --> 815.04
it must be there and that's gravity it's

808.83 --> 819.2700000000001
a big screw you guys you're not gonna

815.04 --> 822.18
get it because reality is crazy reality

819.27 --> 823.92
has some really freaky elements to it

822.18 --> 827.9899999999999
and if you think you're smart think

823.92 --> 830.99
again because reality is not that simple

827.99 --> 830.99
okay

843.47 --> 848.45
yeah relative density the thing about

846.44 --> 851.2700000000001
relative density is it can be

848.45 --> 852.26
scientifically proven and that's not

851.27 --> 857.77
really the end of it

852.26 --> 864.49
it's basically the beginning and yeah

857.77 --> 867.89
gravity points all the other things that

864.49 --> 869.75
are not tied in with the relative

867.89 --> 873.34
density concepts because yeah the

869.75 --> 878.0
relative density concept it doesn't

873.34 --> 881.4100000000001
explain the alignment ratio doesn't

878.0 --> 885.47
explain when other forces are applied

881.41 --> 887.81
other for when forces are proven forces

885.47 --> 890.1800000000001
are applied how the alignment direction

887.81 --> 895.6999999999999
changes all that and that's all part of

890.18 --> 900.1999999999999
the aberration of gravity justice and it

895.7 --> 902.6
is confusing as like nothing else out

900.2 --> 904.09
there but that is what it is and there's

902.6 --> 905.87
nothing that can be done about it

904.09 --> 907.58
because you can't prove it

905.87 --> 909.41
scientifically that there is something

907.58 --> 912.01
there you can't vary it you can't use it

909.41 --> 916.1899999999999
as an independent variable you can use

912.01 --> 918.89
mass your independent variable and then

916.19 --> 922.0300000000001
you prove them that mass is the cause

918.89 --> 925.48
goodie doesn't prove gravity or you can

922.03 --> 928.0
suggest distance according to the baller

925.48 --> 932.84
Debates yesterday distance is well

928.0 --> 935.51
distance is gravity doesn't make any

932.84 --> 937.88
sense it never did you know all the

935.51 --> 942.17
concepts of gravity all these scientific

937.88 --> 945.65
formulas G is always on the side it's

942.17 --> 949.36
never actually the independent variable

945.65 --> 949.36
that's just yeah

949.38 --> 952.73
that's part of the problem

960.23 --> 972.0
you don't need it you don't need it

965.149 --> 977.64
goodie no what you need is all kind of

972.0 --> 981.41
relative that you're architects really

977.64 --> 985.0699999999999
do need gravity they just need the tool

981.41 --> 985.0699999999999
calculation system

986.31 --> 992.1289999999999
because it works it's very handy

989.66 --> 994.529
architecture doesn't mean that was

992.129 --> 1001.72
actually a thing just means that it

994.529 --> 1001.72
works as a tool as a conceptual tool

1002.27 --> 1005.4399999999999
Oh Karen be

1014.6 --> 1020.41
I'm starter UK Schiphol can't see

1023.35 --> 1035.779
so and if you want to get on the hangout

1026.6 --> 1039.9489999999998
and bring in some subjects preferably

1035.779 --> 1045.529
not about war or [ __ ] like that that'll

1039.949 --> 1051.039
be good oh yeah then I forgot the post

1045.529 --> 1051.039
link to them right now

1057.58 --> 1061.08
anyone's welcome

1067.97 --> 1071.3500000000001
so link is up

1077.78 --> 1083.6
it's not all right it's just a minion

1080.35 --> 1090.7289999999998
what is my education

1083.6 --> 1090.7289999999998
my education is life my education is

1092.1 --> 1101.09
letting everything sink in and then

1095.75 --> 1107.81
discarding that which is not real

1101.09 --> 1111.56
that's my education and yeah I got

1107.81 --> 1117.12
almost nothing when it comes to papers

1111.56 --> 1122.34
did graduate pretty good but that's it

1117.12 --> 1127.7399999999998
the rest is all just me my own nature

1122.34 --> 1130.9199999999998
people I've been confronted with types

1127.74 --> 1133.71
of lore I've dipped into and the

1130.92 --> 1138.15
experiments that I have done mostly in

1133.71 --> 1139.91
the psychological region and it's

1138.15 --> 1142.5300000000002
everywhere

1139.91 --> 1144.99
because yeah every time I play the

1142.53 --> 1147.36
indeed for example being a player or a

1144.99 --> 1150.45
game master especially it is a

1147.36 --> 1151.8899999999999
psychological study is a psychological

1150.45 --> 1157.65
study on the go

1151.89 --> 1161.19
see how people respond how they grab

1157.65 --> 1167.3400000000001
things that they're confronted with and

1161.19 --> 1172.41
how they how they extract purpose from

1167.34 --> 1175.34
it and and justifications and all that

1172.41 --> 1177.9
and that is really it's a big study and

1175.34 --> 1179.76
in D&D in a game where it's absolutely

1177.9 --> 1181.98
again there's more freedom because

1179.76 --> 1183.6
they're not gonna hide [ __ ] from me the

1181.98 --> 1188.85
game master you can't really you know

1183.6 --> 1192.33
allow - so I got pure honesty when I do

1188.85 --> 1194.1
that and that's very reliable also when

1192.33 --> 1197.8999999999999
they do actually try to trick you I

1194.1 --> 1202.8
catch on I get the feel for it and

1197.9 --> 1205.5700000000002
that's my study my study is life my life

1202.8 --> 1210.299
and people around me

1205.57 --> 1213.039
the Internet and time especially time

1210.299 --> 1214.6589999999999
confront with something you can't just

1213.039 --> 1218.519
determine straight out this is

1214.659 --> 1221.409
absolutely true this is wrong or

1218.519 --> 1228.789
anything you've gotta let it sink and

1221.409 --> 1231.5800000000002
let the let the details sink in and see

1228.789 --> 1234.039
okay this is right this is wrong this is

1231.58 --> 1237.9089999999999
politicized that is this is just

1234.039 --> 1240.7
straight-out timeless fact and this is

1237.909 --> 1244.779
the reasons why it's being said or

1240.7 --> 1248.769
portrayed at that moment and the other

1244.779 --> 1254.109
time is when then it is said in another

1248.769 --> 1259.479
way or with another purpose at that time

1254.109 --> 1262.6589999999999
in that moment because you don't you

1259.479 --> 1266.1090000000002
know school education papers they don't

1262.659 --> 1269.3490000000002
teach you that they can't they just

1266.109 --> 1272.619
program you with what you're supposed to

1269.349 --> 1277.33
believe is real and what not and what

1272.619 --> 1280.33
you need to know the score the score to

1277.33 --> 1282.489
be successful they condition you to

1280.33 --> 1284.559
limit your own knowledge to be

1282.489 --> 1287.529
successful that's what that is so I

1284.559 --> 1288.97
don't need those freaking papers the

1287.529 --> 1291.789
more I've thought about it the more I

1288.97 --> 1296.999
I'd prefer a good roll of toilet paper

1291.789 --> 1296.999
at least that has some real use you know

1312.32 --> 1316.56
right

1314.03 --> 1322.85
so

1316.56 --> 1326.51
there you go see that's that's my

1322.85 --> 1326.51
educational references

1340.85 --> 1344.1799999999998
that's a joke

1359.27 --> 1365.72
yeah well I don't think I'm gonna be

1362.809 --> 1368.42
deciding to build a plane anytime soon

1365.72 --> 1372.02
although I do get kind of the basic

1368.42 --> 1375.8000000000002
concept complexities of aerodynamics I

1372.02 --> 1379.07
have been very interested at it and with

1375.8 --> 1383.9289999999999
some quick brushing up on engineering

1379.07 --> 1386.57
details I could probably could probably

1383.929 --> 1388.3700000000001
do it and that goes for a lot of things

1386.57 --> 1390.47
there's a lot of things out there that I

1388.37 --> 1392.84
have absolutely no specialisation in

1390.47 --> 1394.97
that I have no training for but I didn't

1392.84 --> 1397.55
glanced at it I did get bit of a feel

1394.97 --> 1400.03
for it how it is what they're focusing

1397.55 --> 1403.97
on what the where the problematics lie

1400.03 --> 1407.23
within the process and I think I can't

1403.97 --> 1409.6100000000001
do it it's a little a little help though

1407.23 --> 1416.65
I'm going to be doing it all by myself

1409.61 --> 1416.6499999999999
yeah that's much more complicated but

1448.9 --> 1454.72
now not designing planes I never liked

1452.35 --> 1456.58
the concept of designing planes have

1454.72 --> 1459.1200000000001
spaceships there's something I'd love

1456.58 --> 1459.12
the design

1463.14 --> 1467.6000000000001
but yeah not really useful

1473.97 --> 1483.299
so yeah links out anybody wants to join

1480.23 --> 1485.45
and do it through Skype you know what to

1483.299 --> 1485.45
do

1503.929 --> 1509.0700000000002
why are you getting all dark for what

1506.639 --> 1511.2289999999998
the hell are you peeping people getting

1509.07 --> 1517.609
so freakin dark over it's really

1511.229 --> 1517.6090000000002
disgusting you know

1538.29 --> 1541.92
my heart

1555.809 --> 1565.399
alright yeah in McKenzie maybe I'm

1561.809 --> 1568.249
trying to call my healer but he's busy

1565.399 --> 1570.7489999999998
can't get through sucks

1568.249 --> 1574.499
although I don't know if he can even

1570.749 --> 1577.83
really help me at this point because

1574.499 --> 1582.57
maybe it is an external maybe this is

1577.83 --> 1584.46
just coming from the inside is

1582.57 --> 1586.769
everything I'm seem to be getting over

1584.46 --> 1590.58
seems to be mostly routed in the

1586.769 --> 1595.71
uncomfortable reality and that's turning

1590.58 --> 1601.559
me dark and yeah it's not really an

1595.71 --> 1603.029
external influence even I don't know why

1601.559 --> 1609.539
don't you just tell us how you really

1603.029 --> 1612.029
feel Hey hello peanuts birth hey what's

1609.539 --> 1618.149
up what do you mean with that

1612.029 --> 1623.999
I was just messin it's so funny how you

1618.149 --> 1629.57
doing I've done better still feel sick

1623.999 --> 1629.57
haven't we all yeah

1630.909 --> 1640.19
like algae related or like so well it's

1636.59 --> 1645.9189999999999
like a cold that's not really a cold

1640.19 --> 1649.01
that refuses to go away like I I don't

1645.919 --> 1655.039
sneeze all the time cough all the time

1649.01 --> 1659.9
but my nose is bothering me and that

1655.039 --> 1664.309
kind of [ __ ] and I just feel weak in

1659.9 --> 1667.279
little hey Nathan ugly hello hey thanks

1664.309 --> 1670.1299999999999
for joining good to be here

1667.279 --> 1671.169
how are you doing I've been better but

1670.13 --> 1674.0590000000002
I'm okay

1671.169 --> 1676.1000000000001
alrighty what is a leading question to

1674.059 --> 1678.44
us for me to ask your oh please could

1676.1 --> 1683.87
you get it oh that's no problem

1678.44 --> 1687.44
look it's just you know spring is coming

1683.87 --> 1690.83
it's good at the same time so much [ __ ]

1687.44 --> 1694.3990000000001
is happening and every piece of

1690.83 --> 1702.77
information I allow myself to dig in it

1694.399 --> 1705.1399999999999
just it all seems too much oh good it

1702.77 --> 1706.6399999999999
feels like there's no more safe haven

1705.14 --> 1711.44
there's no more things that's really

1706.64 --> 1714.169
purely good out there except for except

1711.44 --> 1716.539
for a flat earth maybe Flat Earth

1714.169 --> 1719.0
debates really does stay good place

1716.539 --> 1721.309
although I bet there's just baller

1719.0 --> 1728.229
religious fanatics that are seeing it as

1721.309 --> 1731.69
the absolute dead center devil axis

1728.229 --> 1738.44
cuz you do push even so hard what it

1731.69 --> 1740.45
needs to be done like you know I got you

1738.44 --> 1743.419
know much respect man and don't don't

1740.45 --> 1746.029
don't get offended okay but you do you

1743.419 --> 1749.1090000000002
notice that you you never can give just

1746.029 --> 1752.409
a concise answer to someone's question

1749.109 --> 1757.9689999999998
you're so descriptive you're you like

1752.409 --> 1760.489
even innocent yeah so what answer do you

1757.969 --> 1762.589
want me to give a concise answer to it's

1760.489 --> 1765.349
just God just sometimes I notice when I

1762.589 --> 1767.779
listen back to your show yep

1765.349 --> 1771.289
you you you never can give just a

1767.779 --> 1774.349
concise answer just one simple okay does

1771.289 --> 1774.559
it bother you no no because I know I

1774.349 --> 1776.899
know

1774.559 --> 1780.859
I know I've done that since I was five

1776.899 --> 1790.9989999999998
okay they're very explanatory it's just

1780.859 --> 1795.32
that my nature to do that okay well

1790.999 --> 1798.259
anyway I my stomach still hurts from

1795.32 --> 1803.539
yesterday from laughing so or hello

1798.259 --> 1805.009
Nathan show that was epic man I get two

1803.539 --> 1806.149
different types of people one will say

1805.009 --> 1807.95
that they laugh really hard the other

1806.149 --> 1810.379
will say it's really painful to watch

1807.95 --> 1811.759
so even Travis is like at the end of the

1810.379 --> 1814.009
shows like that's really painful to see

1811.759 --> 1817.129
me listen to him and you going at it and

1814.009 --> 1819.559
our I see is painful you know it's like

1817.129 --> 1821.389
dragging people kicking and screaming

1819.559 --> 1823.279
out there really just fundamentalism but

1821.389 --> 1823.7589999999998
some people will say they find it it's

1823.279 --> 1831.19
terrible

1823.759 --> 1834.6100000000001
and I'm like okay good yeah

1831.19 --> 1839.5
but it is looks exactly that by the way

1834.61 --> 1842.4699999999998
talking about Travis yeah don't know I

1839.5 --> 1848.95
said anybody noticed that I went into

1842.47 --> 1855.1000000000001
one of his hangouts not me Nora was

1848.95 --> 1856.74
there I don't remember but yeah I was

1855.1 --> 1862.23
kind of drunk

1856.74 --> 1865.66
alright and I did like a total Arwen

1862.23 --> 1868.96
dominations free because they were kind

1865.66 --> 1872.23
of I felt they were belittling you and

1868.96 --> 1876.76
what you do that's right but being

1872.23 --> 1879.3700000000001
nitpicky yeah but it's like it felt like

1876.76 --> 1882.76
the geek Chess Club complaining me

1879.37 --> 1885.52
Rainey not spending more details in this

1882.76 --> 1887.92
way not clarifying and I try to explain

1885.52 --> 1889.96
like it's a process it's a very specific

1887.92 --> 1891.67
process there's big pressure on it

1889.96 --> 1895.42
there's something that needs to be

1891.67 --> 1898.63
accomplished and they just refused they

1895.42 --> 1900.8100000000002
refused no it had to be wrong what

1898.63 --> 1904.5100000000002
you're doing is wrong Nathan

1900.81 --> 1906.04
it's wrong that's okay I mean rather

1904.51 --> 1907.9
flattered this were being critical about

1906.04 --> 1913.06
the minutiae of what we're doing rather

1907.9 --> 1915.43
than globe heads being critical of the

1913.06 --> 1917.83
earth being flat well yet selfie scene

1915.43 --> 1920.47
observably but you know it I know it

1917.83 --> 1922.0
peanuts knows it but there's plenty

1920.47 --> 1923.2
people with the dogmatic religious

1922.0 --> 1925.81
belief in this stuff and that's my

1923.2 --> 1928.27
purpose now the fortunate thing about

1925.81 --> 1929.62
the show is anyone can join so all these

1928.27 --> 1931.15
people you name they'll give people and

1929.62 --> 1933.07
what I'm training them down and I'm open

1931.15 --> 1934.42
to criticism right you know that's the

1933.07 --> 1935.8
whole point really isn't it you know

1934.42 --> 1938.92
that people come on and criticize what

1935.8 --> 1940.6299999999999
we're saying so I'm well open for that

1938.92 --> 1942.72
personally yeah the point is that

1940.63 --> 1946.0
anybody's welcome to join Friend or Foe

1942.72 --> 1947.32
and criticize and be critical even of me

1946.0 --> 1948.52
directly you know in the past when

1947.32 --> 1950.32
people come on I want to directly

1948.52 --> 1952.27
criticize how you run the show there

1950.32 --> 1953.9199999999998
enough sources related to water and this

1952.27 --> 1956.77
is a plateau debate then you know

1953.92 --> 1959.89
further the season clapping alright but

1956.77 --> 1962.12
they don't really they stayed out when's

1959.89 --> 1967.5800000000002
the last time they use or not mean

1962.12 --> 1969.77
I'm there or Nora yeah that's okay okay

1967.58 --> 1972.77
that's fine I'm not saying they must

1969.77 --> 1976.58
join to criticize people to do whatever

1972.77 --> 1979.1
they like I know that's definitely true

1976.58 --> 1981.1999999999998
but it's their cell saw just that we all

1979.1 --> 1983.8999999999999
know each other went through so much

1981.2 --> 1986.66
true and to see that happen it just

1983.9 --> 1989.3000000000002
saddens me they're good people our and

1986.66 --> 1991.3100000000002
you know at the end of the day um if

1989.3 --> 1994.19
they wanted to principal they can I mean

1991.31 --> 1997.01
I'm playing devil's advocate let's flick

1994.19 --> 2003.25
the switch those bastards how dare they

1997.01 --> 2008.23
be critical of us are we we do that's

2003.25 --> 2008.95
not very useful there so just a quick

2008.23 --> 2012.43
question

2008.95 --> 2015.3700000000001
Nathan were you able to validate that

2012.43 --> 2017.5600000000002
that was a real scientist he did send me

2015.37 --> 2019.75
an email I just don't have time to look

2017.56 --> 2022.06
through these things maybe so that said

2019.75 --> 2024.01
I'm on the show now right but rather

2022.06 --> 2026.4099999999999
than sitting at the show I know we set

2024.01 --> 2028.06
up about 10 past and I'm not on here I

2026.41 --> 2030.1000000000001
want to give our win some support

2028.06 --> 2031.96
basically the yes he did send me an

2030.1 --> 2033.58
email there was some downloads and

2031.96 --> 2035.3500000000001
attachment of a photo of something he

2033.58 --> 2037.4499999999998
said was in his lab or words about

2035.35 --> 2039.01
effects and I was like you know even to

2037.45 --> 2040.93
put the caveat so you might not accept

2039.01 --> 2045.82
this as proof blah blah blah blah well

2040.93 --> 2047.41
I'm gonna look again at words it doesn't

2045.82 --> 2049.06
really matter whether or not he's a

2047.41 --> 2050.8
scientist and at the time it seems

2049.06 --> 2052.87
really important in my life in my mind

2050.8 --> 2055.51
because I was falling in fraud but it's

2052.87 --> 2056.8599999999997
irrelevant he he is a fraud because he's

2055.51 --> 2059.1400000000003
claiming that you don't need a

2056.86 --> 2062.4700000000003
hypothesis perform a hypothesis Tucker

2059.14 --> 2064.39
ie science well I hadn't have itself is

2062.47 --> 2067.0899999999997
a demonstration at the very least that

2064.39 --> 2069.19
he doesn't perform science even though

2067.09 --> 2071.38
he claims to be a scientist or may even

2069.19 --> 2073.78
be a scientist for all that demonstrates

2071.38 --> 2075.94
the state of science today which is to

2073.78 --> 2078.82
say that people have substituted this

2075.94 --> 2081.28
methods but could you import results for

2078.82 --> 2083.38
a different definition that says I could

2081.28 --> 2085.1800000000003
just define whatever I like see that

2083.38 --> 2087.07
light in the sky that's a ball of gas

2085.18 --> 2089.44
that is and it's situated in a vacuum

2087.07 --> 2091.48
really well have you put that through an

2089.44 --> 2093.52
empirical method to prove you the causal

2091.48 --> 2094.7400000000002
effect that phenomena that you're

2093.52 --> 2096.899
observing or

2094.74 --> 2099.33
no I'm just going to say that's what is

2096.899 --> 2101.19
in here some acts that's like well

2099.33 --> 2103.17
that's not science but they'll tell you

2101.19 --> 2105.4500000000003
it's science and redefine what science

2103.17 --> 2107.4900000000002
is so that their name badging Pope means

2105.45 --> 2108.0899999999997
something suddenly you know that guy was

2107.49 --> 2114.1189999999997
no exception

2108.09 --> 2117.119
declared he was a scientist yep yeah

2114.119 --> 2119.8500000000004
they all do it interested and he has the

2117.119 --> 2121.11
truth coming from his lips when he tells

2119.85 --> 2127.98
us what he thinks

2121.11 --> 2133.98
hey hysterical step presuppositional

2127.98 --> 2135.33
priesthood but um see question peanuts I

2133.98 --> 2136.89
don't know if there's a scientist or an

2135.33 --> 2138.5699999999997
to be a fairy girl on reflection it

2136.89 --> 2140.43
doesn't matter who did enough to

2138.57 --> 2142.619
demonstrate that he's not interested in

2140.43 --> 2144.75
following a the empirical method the

2142.619 --> 2146.79
science actually is he wants to talk us

2144.75 --> 2150.869
out at using that and give citations of

2146.79 --> 2154.5
how science isn't relevant okay why are

2150.869 --> 2156.81
you a scientist then right over because

2154.5 --> 2162.96
he bypassed it because the scientific

2156.81 --> 2165.869
method developed beyond that in other

2162.96 --> 2168.92
words completely discarded it to make

2165.869 --> 2172.109
things more convenient and to make

2168.92 --> 2175.89
presuppositional more possible that's

2172.109 --> 2178.38
what they did he wanted to give us a

2175.89 --> 2180.33
citation for it it's like I know a guy

2178.38 --> 2182.04
that says that it's not really relevant

2180.33 --> 2183.84
anymore and it's evolved beyond it's

2182.04 --> 2186.63
like well if you're a pseudo scientist

2183.84 --> 2189.03
that be the first thing you do you see

2186.63 --> 2191.4900000000002
this this term science this empirical

2189.03 --> 2195.0600000000004
term based on a method we perform to

2191.49 --> 2196.74
prove things well actually I can't do

2195.06 --> 2199.68
that so let's just pretend that's not

2196.74 --> 2202.41
realized science is looking for a

2199.68 --> 2204.0899999999997
telescope and comparing what we see with

2202.41 --> 2208.52
some burning chemicals here on earth

2204.09 --> 2211.44
that's really science and here's how

2208.52 --> 2213.48
doesn't prove your effects your effects

2211.44 --> 2215.91
being a phenomena of the lights in the

2213.48 --> 2217.35
sky and therefore you could argue that

2215.91 --> 2219.359
it does fall into cause and effect

2217.35 --> 2221.04
reason but you're never going to be able

2219.359 --> 2223.44
to validate the cause of that effect

2221.04 --> 2226.15
I do science so what's your solution

2223.44 --> 2235.18
let's redefine what science that

2226.15 --> 2238.359
right yep when he you were asking for an

2235.18 --> 2239.98
example and to forgive me if y'all don't

2238.359 --> 2244.63
want to discuss this I just thought the

2239.98 --> 2248.77
shows great yesterday but you asked him

2244.63 --> 2250.6800000000003
for an example and he he stated taking a

2248.77 --> 2253.18
cup and blowing into it

2250.68 --> 2257.47
and I couldn't tell if he was just being

2253.18 --> 2260.2
sarcastic like being a smartass or if

2257.47 --> 2263.069
that was his serious answer that was

2260.2 --> 2265.5389999999998
those cognitive dissonance of his vilest

2263.069 --> 2266.349
it's happens that's not the first time

2265.539 --> 2267.4300000000003
penis

2266.349 --> 2269.71
that's happens that's happened on

2267.43 --> 2272.6189999999997
multiple occasions where people start

2269.71 --> 2274.69
their example by saying the words in a

2272.619 --> 2275.859
container so your questions how'd you

2274.69 --> 2277.42
have gas pressure without a container

2275.859 --> 2280.45
the reason that the question being

2277.42 --> 2283.51
obvious you've got a ball of gas with a

2280.45 --> 2284.98
vacuum around it by earth in space

2283.51 --> 2286.7200000000003
that's what they've got in their

2284.98 --> 2288.25
religious funding doing so the reason

2286.72 --> 2289.8689999999997
for the question is obvious how drive

2288.25 --> 2292.42
gas directly without a container like

2289.869 --> 2296.44
here can believe you libel and their

2292.42 --> 2298.119
answers that is in a container here's my

2296.44 --> 2300.369
example you go well that's got a

2298.119 --> 2301.48
container well yeah to make my example

2300.369 --> 2303.069
of how you can have gas pressure without

2301.48 --> 2305.22
a container I need to contain it to do

2303.069 --> 2305.22
that

2308.209 --> 2318.779
yeah it's he he also started a lot by

2313.979 --> 2320.8799999999997
saying I believe it was just just the

2318.779 --> 2324.059
more that he spoke just the more that it

2320.88 --> 2328.079
it confirmed to me that he is veered way

2324.059 --> 2329.699
off any type of scientific method but

2328.079 --> 2331.7690000000002
that's what he wants when he redefines

2329.699 --> 2333.4790000000003
what science is people began you can be

2331.769 --> 2336.479
goddamn sure what he'll be redefining

2333.479 --> 2340.1989999999996
years is what he thinks feels and

2336.479 --> 2343.41
beliefs as science so here's this method

2340.199 --> 2345.15
that leads us to a correlation and I

2343.41 --> 2347.3999999999996
believe that the most likely outcome

2345.15 --> 2349.109
from that correlation is the reality we

2347.4 --> 2352.079
live in that's what it asserts and

2349.109 --> 2354.029
implement some maths along the way and

2352.079 --> 2356.039
then you go over seconds this maths only

2354.029 --> 2357.689
relates to you venting a fundamentalist

2356.039 --> 2358.5890000000004
force you can't prove we're that excited

2357.689 --> 2361.259
to be fill it to see

2358.589 --> 2364.339
oh no but that works like this circle

2361.259 --> 2364.339
jerk circle takes like a day

2368.239 --> 2373.89
hey I'm just testing a little computer I

2371.939 --> 2374.989
got going on over here I've no idea what

2373.89 --> 2382.859
I'm doing

2374.989 --> 2383.63
totally different from before hey okay I

2382.859 --> 2388.339
see

2383.63 --> 2392.429
hello good morning guys what's up yeah

2388.339 --> 2399.929
the moon assigned the usual depends on

2392.429 --> 2403.9100000000003
your reference like it's good it's a

2399.929 --> 2403.9100000000003
bird sound nice is there

2405.63 --> 2411.6600000000003
say what they did you've got some nice

2409.62 --> 2415.0499999999997
sounding birds going on just sounds nice

2411.66 --> 2419.25
there you know yeah thank you yeah it's

2415.05 --> 2419.9700000000003
a nice view over here Thunder it's a big

2419.25 --> 2423.6
house

2419.97 --> 2425.79
and we we rented it there's a small

2423.6 --> 2428.52
house in the backyard of a big house you

2425.79 --> 2431.7
know so we got this this little house

2428.52 --> 2433.49
going on mini mini house and it's cool

2431.7 --> 2437.1299999999997
man it's a lot of trees you know it's

2433.49 --> 2449.7299999999996
flowers and plants and stuff really cool

2437.13 --> 2453.75
stuff in Florida you know we rented a

2449.73 --> 2455.34
small house so the owner he got a big

2453.75 --> 2462.03
house in the yard he got two small

2455.34 --> 2464.4300000000003
houses come we rented one of them they

2462.03 --> 2467.9100000000003
by the way hello Adam Eaton thanks for

2464.43 --> 2469.74
coming Norwin your art buddy better but

2467.91 --> 2473.91
I'm okay it's good to have some friends

2469.74 --> 2477.2999999999997
here afternoon knife and Jose who else's

2473.91 --> 2480.0
with us Venus afternoon like oh shut up

2477.3 --> 2482.67
to DMT matrix thanks for donating to my

2480.0 --> 2486.66
super Chet and it says shout out to

2482.67 --> 2490.02
Nathan yes hello waiter rhytm good

2486.66 --> 2493.56
seeing you like the new icon mate I said

2490.02 --> 2495.81
nice but a bit of all work there yeah

2493.56 --> 2498.21
shout out to two legendary super gloomy

2495.81 --> 2505.5
and perspective hijacking hyena he Peter

2498.21 --> 2507.36
for me I love how the name the name

2505.5 --> 2512.07
rolls out of the tongue you know so easy

2507.36 --> 2514.6200000000003
to learn I think if you've listened to

2512.07 --> 2516.29
shows all hundred on words you know it

2514.62 --> 2520.23
okay

2516.29 --> 2523.14
yes indeed it's in brain it's quite

2520.23 --> 2525.03
quite an important name no no it's not

2523.14 --> 2527.4
just it's the name of a very important

2525.03 --> 2528.9900000000002
youtuber go subscribe today to increase

2527.4 --> 2531.57
superlatively mom's done for watching

2528.99 --> 2533.91
hyena but the reason for that elongated

2531.57 --> 2536.52
name is because that is what they claim

2533.91 --> 2538.72
we've seen when we just see something so

2536.52 --> 2542.2599999999998
as an example I can as

2538.72 --> 2545.77
flat earther say I see a lighthouse I

2542.26 --> 2548.5600000000004
can also say I see a car I can say I see

2545.77 --> 2550.24
a boat I can see anything as long as I

2548.56 --> 2555.13
can see it well fine

2550.24 --> 2557.95
however you don't see that lighthouse or

2555.13 --> 2560.32
that boat what you see is a slightly

2557.95 --> 2562.33
looming non-standard refraction high in

2560.32 --> 2563.7400000000002
a holographic projection of the boat or

2562.33 --> 2565.75
lighthouse coming back from the earth

2563.74 --> 2568.359
care that you don't see because you've

2565.75 --> 2572.64
had a life end at 7 6 of the presupposed

2568.359 --> 2574.72
radius of the earth that's why

2572.64 --> 2576.7599999999998
refraction how you met holographic

2574.72 --> 2578.41
projections exist because we see stuff

2576.76 --> 2581.1400000000003
that according to them we shouldn't

2578.41 --> 2583.74
actually see even though we do well to

2581.14 --> 2587.92
be fair Nathan I haven't heard any

2583.74 --> 2590.2299999999996
baller ever for at least a year now

2587.92 --> 2593.44
bring forth that argument they've

2590.23 --> 2596.55
completely discarded it and they just

2593.44 --> 2600.7000000000003
say no no the curve is there it's there

2596.55 --> 2604.1800000000003
they just don't try to precisely

2600.7 --> 2606.6699999999996
calculate it anymore really they they

2604.18 --> 2609.16
stick to primitive curvature calculator

2606.67 --> 2610.9
and that's about it they don't even try

2609.16 --> 2613.7799999999997
to claim looming anymore you know that

2610.9 --> 2617.71
that news reporter what is the weather

2613.78 --> 2620.9500000000003
guy try to do that with the the outlook

2617.71 --> 2622.93
on that city and that's about it after

2620.95 --> 2624.8199999999997
that I think they completely abandoned

2622.93 --> 2629.3199999999997
that concept even though they really do

2624.82 --> 2630.7000000000003
need it so I can't think of any examples

2629.32 --> 2632.8
of people not wanting to go to the

2630.7 --> 2635.7
mathematics what about you Jose you

2632.8 --> 2635.7000000000003
think give any examples

2636.03 --> 2641.2900000000004
now but the mathematic the mathematics

2639.19 --> 2644.14
of the curvature calculator maybe but

2641.29 --> 2646.84
they don't actually claim that it is all

2644.14 --> 2649.72
uniformly looming up to be a flat plane

2646.84 --> 2652.2400000000002
anymore really it just say either did

2649.72 --> 2655.0
the standard approach oh it's just too

2652.24 --> 2656.7999999999997
big you know you have to go really high

2655.0 --> 2658.63
up and really more and more and more and

2656.8 --> 2664.77
more and eventually you'll start to see

2658.63 --> 2667.78
curve that kind of [ __ ] or just say yeah

2664.77 --> 2670.12
obstruction its curvature I know it

2667.78 --> 2672.9700000000003
looks yeah but that's it they don't even

2670.12 --> 2676.1099999999997
try to claim the looming anymore I

2672.97 --> 2678.9399999999996
haven't heard that in a long long time I

2676.11 --> 2682.57
I don't like going to the math and the

2678.94 --> 2684.34
numbers I mean I do it I play with it in

2682.57 --> 2686.5
the phone but that's for right now I

2684.34 --> 2689.83
just got a computer I got it not gonna

2686.5 --> 2692.44
click on the walther billing I hear it

2689.83 --> 2695.02
does name rolling a lot so I gonna play

2692.44 --> 2697.3
in that setup program whatever he has

2695.02 --> 2698.86
formatted to see how he works and then

2697.3 --> 2700.9
they make ways on the computer version

2698.86 --> 2703.06
because I have used the me quest on the

2700.9 --> 2704.9500000000003
phone but it doesn't have too much

2703.06 --> 2706.93
options you know you just you just put

2704.95 --> 2709.12
the mass and the height and the city

2706.93 --> 2711.91
give you a little raw very old-school

2709.12 --> 2722.5
looking set up so I haven't played a lot

2711.91 --> 2731.3799999999997
in the be more options and stuff yeah I

2722.5 --> 2734.29
appreciate I want to see by myself to

2731.38 --> 2736.69
see if everything adds up even if he

2734.29 --> 2737.38
adds up or not it doesn't tell me

2736.69 --> 2744.94
anything

2737.38 --> 2746.86
I just miss ok reasons number one they

2744.94 --> 2749.62
take the effects of objects hitting

2746.86 --> 2753.85
smaller with distance and call that

2749.62 --> 2757.0
earth so otherwise known as perspective

2753.85 --> 2758.89
it's replaced with their the other

2757.0 --> 2762.79
problem being that they have an assumed

2758.89 --> 2765.7
value of earth as a sphere if you're

2762.79 --> 2767.2799999999997
trying to investigate whether or not

2765.7 --> 2769.77
your photos could you

2767.28 --> 2773.4300000000003
fear proof and you go to a calculator

2769.77 --> 2776.37
that's already decided is this fear that

2773.43 --> 2783.24
doesn't help your case their firms

2776.37 --> 2787.38
counseling I hear that yep

2783.24 --> 2789.45
I gotta practice really quick try to

2787.38 --> 2790.92
share screen but I don't want to mess up

2789.45 --> 2794.3999999999996
because I don't want to share the link

2790.92 --> 2796.58
so you you tell me if if I'm getting a

2794.4 --> 2796.58
nerd

2804.51 --> 2812.1400000000003
see it's right and I tried it for the

2807.97 --> 2814.9599999999996
superjet I try this yesterday or two

2812.14 --> 2817.42
days ago on the vegan going or but it

2814.96 --> 2819.91
doesn't give me windows option it gave

2817.42 --> 2822.73
me the whole the whole screen share and

2819.91 --> 2824.5899999999997
then they ordered the windows option is

2822.73 --> 2825.94
empty it doesn't give me nothing even

2824.59 --> 2831.369
though I got a couple windows open

2825.94 --> 2832.84
that's weird I don't know how that works

2831.369 --> 2836.23
in mobiles

2832.84 --> 2839.29
so can't help you there anyway again

2836.23 --> 2842.53
thank you Dan Winfield for the two-pound

2839.29 --> 2846.22
superjet donation with a question or any

2842.53 --> 2849.5800000000004
panel members left that word out go into

2846.22 --> 2856.33
the Amsterdam conference I just said to

2849.58 --> 2859.08
him hell yes I'd love to do it I'll drag

2856.33 --> 2862.81
your ass along the way all right

2859.08 --> 2866.619
yes I think I'm able to to share the

2862.81 --> 2870.4
window okay let me click on a few photos

2866.619 --> 2873.69
in here so we can take a look at it sure

2870.4 --> 2873.69
okay you're presented

2877.75 --> 2880.99
are you gonna go then always hmm are you

2880.51 --> 2884.71
going

2880.99 --> 2887.3799999999997
eat when was it again September or

2884.71 --> 2893.52
something about 30% time we yeah yeah I

2887.38 --> 2896.319
will definitely try hmm sweet

2893.52 --> 2902.47
yeah I'll she'll be there night I'm

2896.319 --> 2905.17
trying yeah I'm actually it's kind of

2902.47 --> 2908.6499999999996
weird I'm considering maybe taking my

2905.17 --> 2912.549
dad there as well go sweet yeah my dad

2908.65 --> 2915.28
he kind of is a flat earther it's not

2912.549 --> 2917.799
something he brags about he's not an

2915.28 --> 2920.23
activist but yeah talked about it and he

2917.799 --> 2922.18
he looks at things differently now he

2920.23 --> 2923.799
gets the glow of the heavens and he just

2922.18 --> 2927.3089999999997
looks at the moon who's like what is

2923.799 --> 2929.44
that that kind of thing so he really

2927.309 --> 2932.4900000000002
does get it doesn't get the whole

2929.44 --> 2935.619
picture but he gets that the

2932.49 --> 2939.43
heliocentric conceptualization is just

2935.619 --> 2943.049
wrong and that you can see that it is

2939.43 --> 2943.049
wrong when you really look at it

2943.11 --> 2949.38
you brought him into flat chops with you

2946.92 --> 2951.81
this it was very hard not to because

2949.38 --> 2954.48
yeah part of the debates I call him a

2951.81 --> 2957.72
lot for moral support sometimes

2954.48 --> 2962.03
financial support business we talk a lot

2957.72 --> 2966.8999999999996
I'm very comfy clothes to my dad and

2962.03 --> 2969.09
yeah it's hard not to then do the Flat

2966.9 --> 2971.64
Earth awakening on him and it was kind

2969.09 --> 2974.07
of tough on him at first but he's always

2971.64 --> 2977.73
been very neutral so he didn't have like

2974.07 --> 2985.05
standard baller allergies at which I

2977.73 --> 2987.48
find very admirably and yeah I see just

2985.05 --> 2990.57
ok with it he's not like gonna be a flat

2987.48 --> 2993.57
earth activist but he he supports me in

2990.57 --> 2995.42
it and yeah he does think like yeah wow

2993.57 --> 2999.7200000000003
the world is not what we've been told

2995.42 --> 3001.64
and say what my dad started doing oh it

2999.72 --> 3005.8999999999996
was a similar sort of thing you know

3001.64 --> 3011.2999999999997
I've shared my knowledge with them when

3005.9 --> 3013.61
they can't escape and that's not like

3011.3 --> 3015.4700000000003
religious goes to chess but he was in

3013.61 --> 3018.26
the past but and he'll still read his

3015.47 --> 3021.29
Bible so he kind of holds that standard

3018.26 --> 3023.6000000000004
Christian doctorate but what he does do

3021.29 --> 3025.81
now is I've read this bit the Bible it

3023.6 --> 3028.88
makes a lot more sense on the flat plate

3025.81 --> 3032.15
and they'll even argue with the Jurgis

3028.88 --> 3034.2200000000003
witnesses now taking passages in the

3032.15 --> 3035.84
Bible and saying this means the Earth's

3034.22 --> 3038.39
flat doesn't it ok

3035.84 --> 3041.29
he's okay he's not activist but

3038.39 --> 3046.0
certainly I think he recognizes there is

3041.29 --> 3048.98
a lot more certainly using his is faith

3046.0 --> 3052.81
in the Bible he's is rereading it now in

3048.98 --> 3057.25
the light of viewing the descriptions

3052.81 --> 3059.87
from a flat perspective and he's I say

3057.25 --> 3062.49
the scripture is making more sense to

3059.87 --> 3064.7799999999997
him you can see that

3062.49 --> 3066.3999999999996
excitement when he reads a passage in

3064.78 --> 3068.65
that I have this a lot more sense for

3066.4 --> 3071.08
you can if you can see Jesus everywhere

3068.65 --> 3076.42
when he returns you can't do that on a

3071.08 --> 3079.5
ball so yep yeah that's that that's the

3076.42 --> 3084.1
amazing thing about Flat Earth and about

3079.5 --> 3087.76
all of this the waking up of the

3084.1 --> 3092.41
heliocentric atheist deception is that

3087.76 --> 3095.1400000000003
subtly like the Christians they you

3092.41 --> 3096.97
don't discard them because they talk

3095.14 --> 3099.97
nonsense that you don't want to listen

3096.97 --> 3102.64
to with this awakening you suddenly

3099.97 --> 3106.39
realize that there is so much to all

3102.64 --> 3108.42
this writing to all this history and

3106.39 --> 3110.92
everything becomes more interesting

3108.42 --> 3113.53
they're suddenly more to point that

3110.92 --> 3117.46
because you're looking well if you're

3113.53 --> 3119.9700000000003
just a closed-off atheist statist you're

3117.46 --> 3122.35
gonna just like go away we hate that

3119.97 --> 3126.25
even though we don't actually know what

3122.35 --> 3130.0299999999997
it really is not really that kind of

3126.25 --> 3135.55
thing so yeah Flat Earth it does open up

3130.03 --> 3138.9700000000003
a lot a lot of opportunities to just see

3135.55 --> 3141.52
the rich details of what is out there in

3138.97 --> 3144.2799999999997
the past all the writings all the books

3141.52 --> 3149.08
all the the religions where do they come

3144.28 --> 3153.61
from what do they actually say and oh it

3149.08 --> 3154.0
was been joined by Chris Barrie oh hey

3153.61 --> 3156.88
Chris

3154.0 --> 3160.75
thanks for joining and another thing

3156.88 --> 3162.67
that that's why I I really I'm really

3160.75 --> 3168.46
you know curious to see how this thing

3162.67 --> 3171.01
with Anthony goes goes because even if

3168.46 --> 3172.75
it does get failed or even if I still

3171.01 --> 3175.42
think something that official will come

3172.75 --> 3178.21
out because from his discussion

3175.42 --> 3182.62
yesterday it is starting to look like

3178.21 --> 3186.43
whatever is taught in schools cannot be

3182.62 --> 3189.73
questioned and to me that's a big red

3186.43 --> 3192.16
flag if it's the truth why can't we

3189.73 --> 3195.15
question it why can't we confirm it

3192.16 --> 3199.98
there that there should be no issue

3195.15 --> 3202.02
with anyone wanting to check or question

3199.98 --> 3204.3
what children are being taught in school

3202.02 --> 3206.19
because if it is the truth then they

3204.3 --> 3208.9500000000003
will have no problem it's just like if

3206.19 --> 3211.71
if or what if you're being accused of

3208.95 --> 3212.5499999999997
killing someone but you know you didn't

3211.71 --> 3215.1
kill anyone

3212.55 --> 3217.05
you're like okay interrogate me check me

3215.1 --> 3219.0
out you know search me you will have no

3217.05 --> 3222.6000000000004
problem yeah can I have that research

3219.0 --> 3226.89
please he'll want to see what is your

3222.6 --> 3230.43
proof yep but it does that make sense to

3226.89 --> 3233.43
all the people on the panel or yeah it

3230.43 --> 3237.0299999999997
does to me that's just a kind of feeling

3233.43 --> 3239.6099999999997
that I got it's starting to like I'm not

3237.03 --> 3244.59
allowed to question what is being taught

3239.61 --> 3248.52
to children yeah yeah and they're making

3244.59 --> 3251.04
it worse even you know because now the

3248.52 --> 3254.7
that's good loophole or political the

3251.04 --> 3259.08
LGBT stuff is also being forced in there

3254.7 --> 3262.8599999999997
and that cannot be questioned you know

3259.08 --> 3269.0099999999998
so they're actually piling on all these

3262.86 --> 3273.29
in questionable programming's and just

3269.01 --> 3273.2900000000004
forcing it forcing it on everyone

3275.37 --> 3278.2999999999997
wouldn't you say

3279.93 --> 3287.5789999999997
yeah well I don't know I'd put it

3285.869 --> 3290.94
slightly different are when I would say

3287.579 --> 3294.599
there's a there's a liberal agenda that

3290.94 --> 3296.43
has been stated no matter how he offends

3294.599 --> 3299.4900000000002
of the people sensibility as it's been

3296.43 --> 3304.049
stated when democratically as the norm

3299.49 --> 3306.75
and if you stray from the alternative

3304.049 --> 3309.93
liberal laughs opinion of this you are

3306.75 --> 3312.329
casting erred and labeled most

3309.93 --> 3316.43
importantly with some derogatory term of

3312.329 --> 3316.4300000000003
that racist homophobic whatever

3316.549 --> 3321.72
irrespective of whether that's just an

3319.23 --> 3323.579
opinion or and are not an action you are

3321.72 --> 3327.089
labeled with that for holding that view

3323.579 --> 3332.3390000000004
and there's a a custom in in society of

3327.089 --> 3336.66
bullying where you're expected to

3332.339 --> 3339.96
conform for fear of public castigation

3336.66 --> 3344.8799999999997
for expressing any opinion outside of

3339.96 --> 3346.079
those defined by the liberal elite and

3344.88 --> 3348.9
just a couple of things

3346.079 --> 3352.529
what's castigation and then I'll go

3348.9 --> 3355.079
sister for the debate I would say

3352.529 --> 3358.079
sticking a label calling a name or

3355.079 --> 3360.4500000000003
castigating them as into categorizing is

3358.079 --> 3364.26
my understanding so to castigate this

3360.45 --> 3368.279
tip say you're a homophobic or you're a

3364.26 --> 3371.579
racist is that not correct stigmatize

3368.279 --> 3374.39
they stigmatize you you get a stamp off

3371.579 --> 3374.3900000000003
disapproval

3374.63 --> 3379.38
sounds like pest occations like giving

3377.279 --> 3380.88
somebody a friend a label and then

3379.38 --> 3383.01
putting them in a category so you can

3380.88 --> 3387.7200000000003
really clean them so yeah that's what I

3383.01 --> 3389.849
mean I'm not using the right word to

3387.72 --> 3391.5589999999997
gate or castigation it was on this

3389.849 --> 3401.01
morning's the word of the day toilet

3391.559 --> 3404.789
paper make yeah thank you for being here

3401.01 --> 3406.1090000000004
and I'll try to be on right after I was

3404.789 --> 3408.1800000000003
very late yesterday

3406.109 --> 3412.13
well wolves in the Hangout now so I'll

3408.18 --> 3412.1299999999997
probably start my pre-show that okay

3414.109 --> 3422.93
Thank You Nikki hey Chris Barry you

3421.339 --> 3423.7599999999998
haven't spoken up yet what brings you

3422.93 --> 3427.609
here

3423.76 --> 3429.5
I'm just driving just drop my kids off

3427.609 --> 3442.22
it's the only reason I'm up this early

3429.5 --> 3443.72
so steal them I've been enough you know

3442.22 --> 3446.5
I've been going to these discourses or

3443.72 --> 3450.4399999999996
not bunch but like this court server to

3446.5 --> 3452.63
talking of different ballers and you

3450.44 --> 3453.29
know it's just I see hos days on Jose it

3452.63 --> 3455.57
goes there

3453.29 --> 3459.47
the Japan don't want a lot - I hear him

3455.57 --> 3461.2400000000002
on there but uh you know I mean I bring

3459.47 --> 3462.95
all the same arguments that Nathan does

3461.24 --> 3465.68
and it's just it's just a lot harder

3462.95 --> 3468.5299999999997
when it's 1 vs. mini and then not only

3465.68 --> 3470.8999999999996
that but you know they just don't accept

3468.53 --> 3472.5800000000004
anything you say so like for example

3470.9 --> 3475.67
yesterday I was talking about gas

3472.58 --> 3478.31
pressure an extra vacuum this guy named

3475.67 --> 3480.77
Phil the physics guy we're basically

3478.31 --> 3482.81
saying you know well you don't even need

3480.77 --> 3485.05
the eye of gravity just even if gravity

3482.81 --> 3487.13
is grylls just the weight alone of the

3485.05 --> 3489.02
particle to prevent it from going out

3487.13 --> 3491.81
into space I'm just like man if I mean

3489.02 --> 3493.82
that's what you believe then I guess but

3491.81 --> 3495.92
I still know if that's true right so I

3493.82 --> 3497.869
mean it really just comes down to just

3495.92 --> 3498.83
confusion and obfuscation and it's like

3497.869 --> 3501.619
well is that true

3498.83 --> 3503.72
just it's a weight alone of the

3501.619 --> 3505.28
particles like because they're saying oh

3503.72 --> 3508.79
well that's a force so that's kind of

3505.28 --> 3511.3390000000004
you know that doesn't knowledge nullify

3508.79 --> 3513.38
the second law or whatever so just the

3511.339 --> 3515.33
weight alone can't prevent it so you

3513.38 --> 3517.6400000000003
know I just it's fun going in there I

3515.33 --> 3519.3489999999997
guess the talk but there's nothing ever

3517.64 --> 3521.15
coming out of those discs or chats it's

3519.349 --> 3524.17
just off the station and more confusion

3521.15 --> 3524.17
as far as I'm concerned

3525.41 --> 3530.7
yeah that's why I'm never gonna go on

3528.18 --> 3533.18
this court because I know that's that's

3530.7 --> 3536.5789999999997
what it is

3533.18 --> 3538.799
although yeah I guess I was a some

3536.579 --> 3540.509
people do manage to actually get

3538.799 --> 3544.529
something interesting out of it I do

3540.509 --> 3547.739
find what what Anthony Reilly does which

3544.529 --> 3551.789
is a discord based hangout and he does

3547.739 --> 3554.9700000000003
yeah do ya manifest interesting

3551.789 --> 3557.1600000000003
discussions pretty good so it's not all

3554.97 --> 3560.1499999999996
bad it's just not a place that I want to

3557.16 --> 3560.1499999999996
go yeah

3562.43 --> 3568.3799999999997
no I missed it I think he was he

3566.099 --> 3571.9500000000003
basically had a 30 minute talk just

3568.38 --> 3573.779
covering if if a tube if filling a tube

3571.95 --> 3576.3289999999997
with water it wasn't considered a vacuum

3573.779 --> 3577.829
or not he was saying it was and they

3576.329 --> 3579.9300000000003
were the ballers were saying it wasn't

3577.829 --> 3580.829
and I mean it went on 30 minutes it was

3579.93 --> 3583.8289999999997
ridiculous Wow

3580.829 --> 3585.15
and I was like obviously it's a into

3583.829 --> 3587.13
vacuum and they're like no it's not a

3585.15 --> 3589.44
vacuum the vacuum is a complete absence

3587.13 --> 3591.539
of all particles and we're like well

3589.44 --> 3594.299
yeah but it's a suction right it's a

3591.539 --> 3596.099
it's a siphon it's it's not a absence of

3594.299 --> 3598.71
particles it's creating a suction and a

3596.099 --> 3600.3590000000004
siphon which is sort of another

3598.71 --> 3602.19
definition for vacuum writing it you're

3600.359 --> 3604.249
like if you says if you have a straw and

3602.19 --> 3606.539
a drink and there's air in the straw

3604.249 --> 3609.3289999999997
that's it's not a vacuum right there's

3606.539 --> 3610.92
air in but if you suck the straw and you

3609.329 --> 3613.2490000000003
bring liquid into your mouth you're

3610.92 --> 3615.66
creating a vacuum right you are

3613.249 --> 3618.029
evacuating the tube over there

3615.66 --> 3622.3089999999997
what's that I mean it's not exactly the

3618.029 --> 3627.829
same what really makes a vacuum is a

3622.309 --> 3631.3190000000004
volumetric space that has been evacuated

3627.829 --> 3633.63
because a vacuum needs a space to be

3631.319 --> 3636.269
evacuated in order for it to truly be a

3633.63 --> 3640.319
vacuum otherwise yeah it's gonna draw

3636.269 --> 3642.5389999999998
other stuff towards it right but you

3640.319 --> 3644.069
better the point is is they wouldn't let

3642.539 --> 3646.079
it go right it's like okay whether it's

3644.069 --> 3648.569
a vacuum or it's citement it's your

3646.079 --> 3649.8900000000003
coffee or you're adding a force to this

3648.569 --> 3651.96
thing right

3649.89 --> 3655.3199999999997
and I mean it just was ridiculous it was

3651.96 --> 3659.07
just it just went on forever and that's

3655.32 --> 3661.26
kind of my point is you know it's it's

3659.07 --> 3663.69
semantics a lot of times and they don't

3661.26 --> 3665.67
they can't admit that that is why I

3663.69 --> 3666.78
created the siphon in this little his

3665.67 --> 3668.01
little test that they were trying to

3666.78 --> 3669.84
save prove gravity

3668.01 --> 3671.4900000000002
oh well no it didn't prove grab the

3669.84 --> 3672.03
improved suction then and that when he

3671.49 --> 3673.4399999999996
moves

3672.03 --> 3675.6600000000003
I don't you've seen this video where he

3673.44 --> 3677.58
like moves these water bottles up and

3675.66 --> 3679.41
down and it adds more water or less

3677.58 --> 3682.23
depending on if you move it or not

3679.41 --> 3685.5
though that proves gravity because no

3682.23 --> 3687.09
block no I don't know reasons and it

3685.5 --> 3688.92
just doesn't make any sense but they

3687.09 --> 3693.84
have to hold on to gravity they can't

3688.92 --> 3695.25
let it go yep it's very hard let go if

3693.84 --> 3697.59
you don't even know what it is by the

3695.25 --> 3700.35
way I need to mention here only cheapo

3697.59 --> 3702.6000000000004
can't see just donated 20 New Zealand

3700.35 --> 3705.54
dollars to my super Chet and he wishes

3702.6 --> 3709.94
all the best for your tests

3705.54 --> 3712.35
peanuts Clark also yeah he kind of put

3709.94 --> 3715.05
what is it here for now kind of on the

3712.35 --> 3718.5299999999997
spots and because he said I for no good

3715.05 --> 3721.05
reason at all he said if someone super

3718.53 --> 3722.88
cats are in for twenty dollars in the

3721.05 --> 3725.1200000000003
next five minute he will delete his two

3722.88 --> 3728.01
and a half year old YouTube account so

3725.12 --> 3729.3599999999997
not gonna ask you to do that but yeah it

3728.01 --> 3735.63
makes you kind of look stupid now

3729.36 --> 3737.4900000000002
doesn't it my screen is hit play then

3735.63 --> 3739.86
you guys can t continue talking and just

3737.49 --> 3756.8399999999997
present the video I'm sure I mean if you

3739.86 --> 3759.96
want this is the second one this is in

3756.84 --> 3762.84
the little value this is the second spot

3759.96 --> 3766.29
I don't know exactly the coordinates the

3762.84 --> 3768.7200000000003
height is the same height from the

3766.29 --> 3770.4
freeway you know it's really high like

3768.72 --> 3774.7999999999997
from the freeway to the water that's

3770.4 --> 3778.5
maybe 30 or 40 foot high and I it's a

3774.8 --> 3781.59
canal seven-and-a-half 7.2 miles long

3778.5 --> 3783.51
channel to this little bar that the

3781.59 --> 3785.31
division where the boats are on the knee

3783.51 --> 3787.8900000000003
this is about three and a half miles

3785.31 --> 3790.23
from where I am plus there's three three

3787.89 --> 3792.5699999999997
and a three a little three more miles

3790.23 --> 3794.73
past that so it's a total seven miles

3792.57 --> 3797.46
and it gives an illusion of curve as you

3794.73 --> 3799.859
can see here I'm just zooming in in the

3797.46 --> 3801.81
in the automatic setup in the camera I'm

3799.859 --> 3803.64
just zooming in and and that's what I

3801.81 --> 3805.65
catch that's what soundly catches all

3803.64 --> 3807.7799999999997
the time he does videos here most of the

3805.65 --> 3809.9100000000003
times it was a little hazy a little

3807.78 --> 3812.01
foggy but I still took the footage and I

3809.91 --> 3813.54
think it came out pretty good I just let

3812.01 --> 3817.619
the camera roll for a few minutes there

3813.54 --> 3820.2
and it's pretty cool to look at straily

3817.619 --> 3822.56
steep isn't it in that in that shot it's

3820.2 --> 3825.54
quite steady and then really really

3822.56 --> 3827.97
tails up and it curls off more curvature

3825.54 --> 3832.83
on the left side look then you've got on

3827.97 --> 3835.5899999999997
the right yeah it's really cool effect I

3832.83 --> 3838.5
mean like I got the footage from the

3835.59 --> 3840.7200000000003
other side he gives the same effect but

3838.5 --> 3842.94
from the other side I did it lower maybe

3840.72 --> 3844.859
a 10-foot from the water this is a

3842.94 --> 3847.4
little higher 30 or 40 foot above the

3844.859 --> 3847.4
water but

3847.859 --> 3851.6
Doria it looks it looks pretty cool I

3856.4 --> 3861.42
don't know if it's real curved or not it

3858.93 --> 3863.79
looks curved but because it does look

3861.42 --> 3865.65
curved and it straight you know it's a

3863.79 --> 3867.42
straight canal you know come compare

3865.65 --> 3871.55
what you're seeing in your footage to

3867.42 --> 3871.55
this for a second

3875.0 --> 3883.35
what's your zoom level here this is a

3880.17 --> 3886.619
little less than the total 80 times zoom

3883.35 --> 3889.71
the P 980 times in for the easy optical

3886.619 --> 3891.7200000000003
right or the ITO the optical yeah I did

3889.71 --> 3894.39
a little bit less than that I didn't

3891.72 --> 3897.8399999999997
pass that zoom you know the high quality

3894.39 --> 3899.73
isn't why I take the offer if I'm doing

3897.84 --> 3903.9300000000003
I've just knock off the digital zoom so

3899.73 --> 3905.52
a call let's zoom past there it saves it

3903.93 --> 3907.5
gives me a stop you know if I keep

3905.52 --> 3908.79
zooming zooming it will stop what he

3907.5 --> 3910.92
stopped and then I have to click it

3908.79 --> 3914.88
again to go past that yeah so I never I

3910.92 --> 3917.05
never click above that you know can you

3914.88 --> 3920.02
see how the left the left conquer

3917.05 --> 3921.55
is dipping it looks to be curving

3920.02 --> 3923.32
slightly different to the right the

3921.55 --> 3926.8900000000003
right one kind of goes up a little bit

3923.32 --> 3928.21
it's got because you've got the ridges

3926.89 --> 3930.4
and they're sitting slightly higher than

3928.21 --> 3932.77
the diffraction by the two curves look

3930.4 --> 3935.7400000000002
slightly different than you say because

3932.77 --> 3938.32
the curve Y is defined by the shadow

3935.74 --> 3939.6699999999996
under this Dicky out box and yes same on

3938.32 --> 3942.1600000000003
the left but because they're slightly

3939.67 --> 3943.9300000000003
different you get in a it's like leeks

3942.16 --> 3945.43
raised a little bit more on the right it

3943.93 --> 3947.29
doesn't curve for a little bit and then

3945.43 --> 3951.54
continues the curve where's that the

3947.29 --> 3956.05
last ones a lot smoother curve yeah I

3951.54 --> 3957.82
see that yeah let me see if I can play

3956.05 --> 3961.78
they are the one from the other hand

3957.82 --> 3963.4900000000002
really quick and this is almost done

3961.78 --> 3965.7900000000004
miss it next to a few second it's a

3963.49 --> 3968.2
great shot though it's kind of like

3965.79 --> 3969.55
you've got that in the same shot but you

3968.2 --> 3972.37
kind of merging it with their nice

3969.55 --> 3976.0
corridor shot for the face really yes

3972.37 --> 3977.3199999999997
good shot to analyze thank you I look at

3976.0 --> 3980.11
that yeah then died coming all the way

3977.32 --> 3987.1600000000003
out so so we get an idea what's going on

3980.11 --> 3988.9300000000003
that yeah the problem I'm uh I'm a

3987.16 --> 3994.69
screen shared the other ones let me sit

3988.93 --> 3996.8799999999997
up yeah I just wanted to say shout out

3994.69 --> 4006.42
to race man thank you thank you for your

3996.88 --> 4009.3
positive interment indeed yeah but uh on

4006.42 --> 4012.2400000000002
this on this footage that was there was

4009.3 --> 4014.3100000000004
a boat that passed by rock critic and it

4012.24 --> 4016.7099999999996
kind of gave me an idea of the size

4014.31 --> 4020.0099999999998
because when I first was looking at it I

4016.71 --> 4021.9900000000002
didn't realize how big those pillars

4020.01 --> 4025.0200000000004
were and then when I see in that boat it

4021.99 --> 4031.9799999999996
really gave me an idea of how big they

4025.02 --> 4034.97
were yes yes big-time let me hit play on

4031.98 --> 4034.97
this one

4040.32 --> 4049.09
I'll be ready in 30 seconds I am gonna

4047.38 --> 4050.08
probably round out to show somewhere in

4049.09 --> 4053.44
the next five minutes

4050.08 --> 4058.6
what yeah I still want to see that

4053.44 --> 4060.31
footage yeah I'm gonna say that grab a

4058.6 --> 4063.91
sandwich then jump over to Nathan's you

4060.31 --> 4065.49
riding out all in yeah yeah somewhere in

4063.91 --> 4068.23
the next five minutes

4065.49 --> 4071.0499999999997
well I'll say thank you now then chase

4068.23 --> 4075.9900000000002
Robin is on pal thank you for being here

4071.05 --> 4078.25
so it's been a pleasure to have you

4075.99 --> 4082.14
there's the afternoon off work mate

4078.25 --> 4082.14
first chance I've had in a while tea

4087.099 --> 4098.2300000000005
those videos up on your channel now

4089.229 --> 4103.509
how's that muted yes yes they're on my

4098.23 --> 4105.3099999999995
channel take a look and take your time

4103.509 --> 4109.96
you know they break it down to see well

4105.31 --> 4114.75
what we can figure out okay I found this

4109.96 --> 4121.77
B of you one sayin wait our media player

4114.75 --> 4121.77
and I'm gonna click the share window and

4121.829 --> 4129.579
share got it I think you got it how you

4125.38 --> 4136.0
presented yes excellent look at that

4129.579 --> 4142.5689999999995
this is from the order and this is a lot

4136.0 --> 4144.969
lower engagement the weather looks a bit

4142.569 --> 4147.67
[ __ ] here as well yeah I was really

4144.969 --> 4149.71
shitty yeah from the other side he was a

4147.67 --> 4152.77
little clearer but this side looking

4149.71 --> 4155.7390000000005
that way may not I get even before you

4152.77 --> 4157.75
start to see many who say that the fog

4155.739 --> 4160.329
yeah the haze in it it's a lot darker

4157.75 --> 4162.429
Zin there's no no scholar some lioness

4160.329 --> 4165.88
at all is the lightning

4162.429 --> 4168.279
yeah but I like this is I mean does this

4165.88 --> 4169.6900000000005
one of the structures is really long and

4168.279 --> 4172.27
straight you know he's just a little

4169.69 --> 4178.299
canal so he's good to do this kind of

4172.27 --> 4180.279
observations and figure was Conan not

4178.299 --> 4184.449
everywhere there's a seven seven mile

4180.279 --> 4186.790000000001
stretch of little canal off of clear

4184.449 --> 4193.8099999999995
water you know like smooth you know no

4186.79 --> 4196.239
waves no tight or no no no that's it see

4193.81 --> 4198.9400000000005
that's that that waters really curving

4196.239 --> 4201.129999999999
off at the beginning as well just

4198.94 --> 4203.32
noticing there that that's Alma if you

4201.13 --> 4206.5
were on a ball you would actually be

4203.32 --> 4207.94
kind of leaning back to get that shot

4206.5 --> 4210.699
because you've got to lean back to get

4207.94 --> 4213.369
the ball to curve away from and then

4210.699 --> 4215.419999999999
eclipse and it kind of levels out the

4213.369 --> 4218.33
curve on the water or prognosis

4215.42 --> 4219.71
it's from their foreground to the middle

4218.33 --> 4223.94
ground and then it kind of gets a bit

4219.71 --> 4225.35
straighter the water Marge of the

4223.94 --> 4227.089999999999
shadows probably converting that a

4225.35 --> 4231.620000000001
little bit so it's adding to the curves

4227.09 --> 4236.360000000001
me yeah and then baby fog you didn't

4231.62 --> 4240.89
help either yeah it's very foggy in

4236.36 --> 4242.45
there yes but it was really cool just to

4240.89 --> 4244.43
be there and see it with my eyes and

4242.45 --> 4248.29
then zooming in with the camera you get

4244.43 --> 4248.29
a total different perspective you know

4249.19 --> 4255.29
left on side Jose you see how the shadow

4252.11 --> 4256.61
of the overhang is his creator them he's

4255.29 --> 4260.42
a really good example out of the

4256.61 --> 4262.94
perspective there's these relative size

4260.42 --> 4264.92
of the shadow decreases to you in the

4262.94 --> 4267.469999999999
image even though the standard shadows

4264.92 --> 4271.37
the same with all the way what it's

4267.47 --> 4273.5
doing in terms of the the straightness

4271.37 --> 4276.2
of the line of the shadow is curving

4273.5 --> 4281.0
loads because it's shrinking in width

4276.2 --> 4283.07
with the perspective it's what basically

4281.0 --> 4293.87
he said I mean that's quite a quite a

4283.07 --> 4296.63
beautiful shot thank you for your show

4293.87 --> 4298.51
