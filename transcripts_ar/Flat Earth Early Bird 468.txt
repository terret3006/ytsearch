fercho yeah I know good turn yeah hello

88.81 --> 93.76
everyone sorry for being so incredibly

90.55 --> 94.81
late it was I've had a crazy night a

93.76 --> 97.51
good night

94.81 --> 99.729
very good night I could not get myself

97.51 --> 106.69
to go to bed I literally went to sleep

99.729 --> 109.69
at think 8 o'clock it was crazy but yeah

106.69 --> 113.649
because of it I slept very well once I

109.69 --> 115.81
gotten to sleep and then it's just like

113.649 --> 118.509
alarm clock oh yeah uh a rest some more

115.81 --> 122.41
and then I'm like ok I'm good now ok

118.509 --> 125.16
let's wake up it's 5 to 2 what is is

122.41 --> 125.16
dammit

126.75 --> 132.79
so I rushed rushed rushed rushed rushed

129.369 --> 136.3
and I haven't even finished my first

132.79 --> 140.38
coffee yet but yeah that's you shouldn't

136.3 --> 142.3
just chalk that soon as you wake up so I

140.38 --> 144.91
just thought now I have to take some

142.3 --> 149.17000000000002
extra time to wake up I can't just Ram

144.91 --> 155.49
myself into go mode in 5 minutes it's

149.17 --> 159.22
just physically impossible so anyway

155.49 --> 161.37
yeah the weather I don't know it it's

159.22 --> 163.17
not as beautiful it was yesterday

161.37 --> 167.58
this morning and was still beautiful you

163.17 --> 171.0
can still see some bright blue sky over

167.58 --> 177.84
there have it over there it's all big

171.0 --> 181.049
cloud so no wind I maybe yeah that made

177.84 --> 183.48
me even more than surprised that the

181.049 --> 189.95000000000002
worst of the the wind gusts is over now

183.48 --> 189.95
it seems or at least today hmm

191.299 --> 195.41
yeah it's right over there

201.959 --> 205.129
really Jose

208.44 --> 219.78
really no now what one of the reasons I

214.71 --> 224.66
did basically stuck around tensely it's

219.78 --> 224.66
also because of ya channel roadways and

224.78 --> 231.75
she was on very late like a nurse just a

229.49 --> 233.4
one-person here I almost like this and

231.75 --> 235.08
she was interacting with chat it was

233.4 --> 239.31
funny because she was dual streaming

235.08 --> 243.03
with the live and YouTube and I always

239.31 --> 246.87
find her on the life but it's like like

243.03 --> 248.94
two or three people watching their so I

246.87 --> 252.33
end up like being the only one just

248.94 --> 254.64
feeling the entire chat because I do

252.33 --> 255.66000000000003
have a lot to say in the face of what

254.64 --> 259.739
she's talking about

255.66 --> 260.63
just very spiritually aware and she has

259.739 --> 268.22999999999996
some skills

260.63 --> 270.36
I'd like I could feel it and yeah well I

268.23 --> 273.06
I contact her through email I don't know

270.36 --> 275.85
I don't think she says sky per said that

273.06 --> 278.04
may be a little bit difficult but I

275.85 --> 280.83000000000004
emailed her and the said like yeah dude

278.04 --> 282.6
or dude I didn't say that but like

280.83 --> 286.2
thought it would be cool to maybe do a

282.6 --> 289.08000000000004
show together at some point some reason

286.2 --> 290.82
and maybe I want to take one of her

289.08 --> 292.97999999999996
courses to I don't know I don't know

290.82 --> 298.26
what it even would cost her anything she

292.98 --> 301.5
I think she knows my situation the

298.26 --> 306.21
computer serious no but she knows a lot

301.5 --> 309.27
about spiritual healing issues even as

306.21 --> 315.53999999999996
she understands the path and she

309.27 --> 318.81
translated that to me very well and yeah

315.54 --> 321.90000000000003
I see it like this I need to keep on

318.81 --> 324.57
developing my own skills to deal with

321.9 --> 327.06
the spiritual and especially my

324.57 --> 332.63
predicament my personal predicament in

327.06 --> 336.36
this world where I am basically yeah

332.63 --> 339.32
don't take it too literal it seems I

336.36 --> 341.49
feel like I'm like I've been scarred

339.32 --> 342.12
pretty early in my life by being

341.49 --> 343.919
confronted

342.12 --> 346.949
with things that it could not handle not

343.919 --> 350.37
even close like my intellect could grasp

346.949 --> 352.62
it but that was probably the danger

350.37 --> 355.11
because I could grasp things that I

352.62 --> 358.82
could not take and it backlashed big

355.11 --> 364.35
time on me in a very introverted way and

358.82 --> 366.78
now seems that I am I don't know I call

364.35 --> 370.65000000000003
it very sensitive now I have literally

366.78 --> 374.09999999999997
very heavy senses but it's also it seems

370.65 --> 377.37
to be difficult for me to close myself

374.1 --> 380.85
off naturally and my healers confirmed

377.37 --> 382.919
this for a long time working on it

380.85 --> 384.6
figuring out like what should I focus on

382.919 --> 386.46
to prevent that from happening and all

384.6 --> 388.97900000000004
that and I got and kind of okay at it

386.46 --> 395.63899999999995
but it still seems that I'm relatively

388.979 --> 398.25
vulnerable so I want another person to

395.639 --> 401.09000000000003
kind of help me figure it out from

398.25 --> 404.639
another angle from another personal

401.09 --> 412.13899999999995
angle so that I could basically compare

404.639 --> 416.22
the two effects for my conscious and

412.139 --> 419.94
subconscious to really figure out what

416.22 --> 422.36
it is that my healer and her does so

419.94 --> 428.21
that I might be able to somehow

422.36 --> 433.11
assimilate the technique in a more

428.21 --> 438.87
stable way for myself because if I don't

433.11 --> 441.18
and I'll I need I need to progress my

438.87 --> 444.12
knowledge and to do it I need to

441.18 --> 447.389
basically what I call experiment let

444.12 --> 451.05
people do things and then figure out how

447.389 --> 453.87
much I can trust it and then just

451.05 --> 456.15000000000003
compare the feel of it it is almost like

453.87 --> 457.65
yeah getting to know a friend and

456.15 --> 459.51
getting to know another friend and

457.65 --> 461.60999999999996
another friend and another friend over

459.51 --> 464.31
your lifetime and then basically

461.61 --> 466.56
comparing how all the relationships and

464.31 --> 469.71
the interactions went to figure out

466.56 --> 471.51
patterns mostly concerning yourself in

469.71 --> 474.599
the face of different type of characters

471.51 --> 475.08
and then eventually when you got enough

474.599 --> 476.729
compared

475.08 --> 481.65
same material you'll start to notice

476.729 --> 485.55
these patterns so that is kind of like

481.65 --> 487.85999999999996
an impulse Drive that I feel like yeah I

485.55 --> 491.219
want to I want to progress and this is

487.86 --> 492.99
potentially a way to do it that got me

491.219 --> 504.199
kind of enthusiastic as well like that

492.99 --> 511.139
and I did that idea so yeah right also

504.199 --> 515.149
having friends seem hard yeah it is well

511.139 --> 519.12
for me it is but it's also because

515.149 --> 521.519
biggest difficulty for me in general is

519.12 --> 525.12
to kind of find an understanding and a

521.519 --> 530.76
balance with those friends because I am

525.12 --> 535.589
NOT I'm not a very socially balanced

530.76 --> 537.75
person it's like I try not to be

535.589 --> 543.0290000000001
antisocial like especially not on

537.75 --> 546.93
purpose you know like but it's just not

543.029 --> 549.209
I'm not so sociable like some people

546.93 --> 550.89
that is just okay that'll open the door

549.209 --> 551.4899999999999
for anyone that can deal with almost

550.89 --> 555.24
anything

551.49 --> 557.64
that's not me though

555.24 --> 560.24
compared to say 20 years ago I'm a world

557.64 --> 560.24
of difference

572.14 --> 580.52
yeah well michael roark that's a good

576.11 --> 591.04
advice in general for me it's slightly

580.52 --> 591.04
different because for me it is also like

591.31 --> 601.3
does that friendship work for me or does

594.8 --> 601.3
it quickly turn into just a a or is a

603.94 --> 612.8900000000001
more like an acquaintance type situation

608.5 --> 617.03
because I don't know for me a friendship

612.89 --> 621.28
that requires some kind of connection

617.03 --> 623.72
that reaches a deeper level for me

621.28 --> 625.91
that's kind of essential if that's not

623.72 --> 630.35
there then there's just nothing to feed

625.91 --> 632.7199999999999
into for me and then you go into like

630.35 --> 635.08
colleague mode that that's what happens

632.72 --> 635.08
with me

647.13 --> 654.6899999999999
Pete made you rent yeah I noticed that I

650.46 --> 657.8100000000001
I did pop by for a second even though

654.69 --> 660.84
I'm banned there but yeah you know I

657.81 --> 661.8299999999999
banned Randy so of course he's gonna ban

660.84 --> 664.86
me I don't care

661.83 --> 666.5400000000001
there's nothing much to add to that

664.86 --> 671.88
place anyway but yeah

666.54 --> 673.5899999999999
Samhain dropped $1000 on Randy for some

671.88 --> 677.91
reason I think even before his show

673.59 --> 683.52
started that was pretty crazy but that's

677.91 --> 686.7199999999999
all fine you know it's getting it or

683.52 --> 686.72
reason probably

690.41 --> 693.549
[Music]

698.319 --> 705.9989999999999
fear-mongering pays who knows you know I

702.72 --> 715.629
suspect there's things behind it

705.999 --> 717.549
my rent is doing but yeah it's just hmm

715.629 --> 723.399
yeah thanks Michael work us yeah I

717.549 --> 725.9789999999999

869.68 --> 874.76
hey thanks good serpents for the $1

872.39 --> 878.72
super jet donation just came to that

874.76 --> 883.13
oh stop monkey 3d here Paul Roberts the

878.72 --> 905.1700000000001
enemy canoe yeah I think I covered

883.13 --> 908.06
everyone now finally so yeah I saw a

905.17 --> 910.67
absolutely a stone in good movie

908.06 --> 914.8699999999999
yesterday also it's a lot of good stuff

910.67 --> 918.16
that went past or went through me I went

914.87 --> 921.35
to Netflix and got a movie suggested

918.16 --> 925.6
never heard of or wait and I did hear of

921.35 --> 930.35
it but at the time my mind was not at it

925.6 --> 934.36
so I didn't watch that it's called the

930.35 --> 940.52
professor and the madman and it's with

934.36 --> 942.62
Mel Gibson and that movie is so gorgeous

940.52 --> 945.14
although there's some really dark [ __ ]

942.62 --> 947.72
in there as well but it's like personal

945.14 --> 951.11
so it's literally you can't get more

947.72 --> 953.33
accurate with the title it is literally

951.11 --> 956.87
about the foundations of the English

953.33 --> 961.0400000000001
language in a historical sense and about

956.87 --> 965.08
well just the characters of those people

961.04 --> 967.5799999999999
and their culture and also yeah about

965.08 --> 969.71
yeah another figure that apparently I

967.58 --> 974.57
think this is based on history even in

969.71 --> 980.9000000000001
its own way yeah the mad man a guy who's

974.57 --> 983.5100000000001
a I think a civil war vet something like

980.9 --> 985.5
that in American War and he's like

983.51 --> 988.05
heavily PTSD and

985.5 --> 989.97
as his serious mental issues and you

988.05 --> 991.56
figure that out more and more over the

989.97 --> 994.82
movie like what's going on with him and

991.56 --> 999.4499999999999
he's like a super tragic character and

994.82 --> 1001.61
yeah that like he really rubbed off on

999.45 --> 1003.1400000000001
my heart because of just that character

1001.61 --> 1005.66
I could totally get it

1003.14 --> 1010.9399999999999
somebody that just so intense and he

1005.66 --> 1014.5899999999999
can't handle his own feelings and his

1010.94 --> 1020.09
own conscious as it were it's it was

1014.59 --> 1023.75
absolutely a brilliant movie like yeah

1020.09 --> 1028.339
exhilarating and with some really dark

1023.75 --> 1030.47
things in there as well so but in a yeah

1028.339 --> 1036.5
in a good way it like me in a good way

1030.47 --> 1038.329
is like they did it right there's a real

1036.5 --> 1041.12
reasoning by now though anyway I

1038.329 --> 1043.79
recommend if you like the English

1041.12 --> 1047.36
language they like Oxford English and

1043.79 --> 1050.45
all that and you like like historical

1047.36 --> 1053.02
themed movies or if you like Mel Gibson

1050.45 --> 1057.26
because he did create in his movie

1053.02 --> 1059.93
crushing that character yeah watch it to

1057.26 --> 1063.34
tastic it's called the professor and the

1059.93 --> 1063.3400000000001
madman it's on Netflix

1073.38 --> 1081.1000000000001
he can't handle the truth yeah

1077.95 --> 1085.8700000000001
in a way he couldn't it also because

1081.1 --> 1088.1999999999998
yeah well I don't want to spoil too much

1085.87 --> 1091.03
of the movie I think I gave away enough

1088.2 --> 1094.51
you know don't want to just lay out

1091.03 --> 1097.68
their whole process because it's a very

1094.51 --> 1101.59
subtly is there's a lot of subtlety

1097.68 --> 1103.99
built into the movie it's a very gradual

1101.59 --> 1105.49
careful learning process like a really

1103.99 --> 1107.65
well-written book I don't know maybe

1105.49 --> 1110.02
even overpraising it out it made a giant

1107.65 --> 1112.48
impression on me and I will have to

1110.02 --> 1114.67
watch it back maybe in the

1112.48 --> 1118.24
not-too-distant future to compare it

1114.67 --> 1130.74
again it just made a great impression on

1118.24 --> 1130.74
me the news benders what is that

1138.35 --> 1148.549
okay oh oh gods yes you found it thank

1145.61 --> 1150.4699999999998
you thank you

1148.549 --> 1154.309
oh god I'm gonna download that

1150.47 --> 1160.75
immediately yes that was the video that

1154.309 --> 1160.75
Owen Benjamin was playing two days ago

1160.87 --> 1169.789
yes oh that would add such an

1164.96 --> 1172.009
interesting video you don't want to lose

1169.789 --> 1174.07
it outside so I'm gonna put it on my

1172.009 --> 1174.07
computer

1180.93 --> 1187.0800000000002
right but you know what I mean now right

1183.8 --> 1191.28
when I went all like oh my god this is

1187.08 --> 1192.8
like the craziest thing ever if you

1191.28 --> 1198.35
realize that that it was actually

1192.8 --> 1198.35
broadcast in 69 or something

1215.33 --> 1218.33
yeah

1232.8 --> 1245.24
what parts 610 BC they sailed around

1238.95 --> 1245.24
Africa really who exactly did

1248.6 --> 1254.1799999999998
like I'm sure they did you know back

1251.09 --> 1256.73
then the Phoenicians among other it's a

1254.18 --> 1261.8
great likelihood that even back in the

1256.73 --> 1267.1100000000001
day there was like contact with even the

1261.8 --> 1269.0
Americas but probably in secret its I

1267.11 --> 1273.77
could imagine that they basically

1269.0 --> 1276.44
figured out astronomic exploration way

1273.77 --> 1279.32
before anyone else did and they would

1276.44 --> 1281.3600000000001
just like use it as like a secret pilot

1279.32 --> 1284.81
Pirate Island effect they would say like

1281.36 --> 1287.6
yeah nobody even knows how to get there

1284.81 --> 1290.6
we do so where we can basically always

1287.6 --> 1292.79
go there and retreat and nobody would be

1290.6 --> 1297.4099999999999
able to find us without getting lost in

1292.79 --> 1298.07
the storms at sea so I wouldn't be

1297.41 --> 1301.5800000000002
surprised

1298.07 --> 1304.61
back then they did sail around Africa

1301.58 --> 1308.87
and maybe even across the Atlantic

1304.61 --> 1312.52
towards the Americas that were not

1308.87 --> 1312.52
called the Americas of course but

1323.47 --> 1331.4
[Music]

1333.38 --> 1343.3090000000002
yeah I don't really know how even

1335.98 --> 1346.13
totally going around the realm is really

1343.309 --> 1349.309
proving the globe anyway although yeah

1346.13 --> 1352.64
they of course we all know that that is

1349.309 --> 1355.3999999999999
kind of how the historical story of

1352.64 --> 1357.6200000000001
figuring out how the earth is a globe is

1355.4 --> 1360.25
supposed to go I even did a literal

1357.62 --> 1365.3899999999999
presentation about it in school how

1360.25 --> 1368.69
Magellan went around the globe and then

1365.39 --> 1370.97
I used what I my material where it was

1368.69 --> 1373.8200000000002
described everywhere he went and then I

1370.97 --> 1376.34
took like a plastic globe thing with a

1373.82 --> 1378.86
lamp in it and I literally well

1376.34 --> 1381.53
basically trashed it by drawing on it

1378.86 --> 1383.87
with a with a black marker the entire

1381.53 --> 1387.8899999999999
route of how Magellan supposedly

1383.87 --> 1391.2099999999998
supposedly went around the world there

1387.89 --> 1395.98
was a presentation when I was 13 I think

1391.21 --> 1395.98
when I did that 13 or 14

1399.389 --> 1409.6299999999999
but yeah it's just yeah he went he went

1403.419 --> 1411.94
around the realm now look he didn't

1409.63 --> 1415.3600000000001
actually really even went a straight

1411.94 --> 1419.1390000000001
path you had to find his way through and

1415.36 --> 1422.62
around and all that so to conclude from

1419.139 --> 1428.9799999999998
the entire route that he would be going

1422.62 --> 1432.149
around the globe is literally presuming

1428.98 --> 1435.45
the earth is a globe that he went around

1432.149 --> 1439.6
because he basically just trans first

1435.45 --> 1442.95
the map in a certain fashion but you can

1439.6 --> 1445.899
literally interpret that from the disk

1442.95 --> 1449.169
projection perspective that he went

1445.899 --> 1453.309
around the disk or you could also see it

1449.169 --> 1458.289
as yeah he just he just passed a loop of

1453.309 --> 1461.47
the rectangular looping realm and he he

1458.289 --> 1464.169
passed a loop so it all depends really

1461.47 --> 1467.679
on the equatorial orientation within

1464.169 --> 1475.1200000000001
this realm to determine what he really

1467.679 --> 1477.279
did like did he go in a geometrical

1475.12 --> 1480.399
literal circle or did he just go in a

1477.279 --> 1487.75
straight line ending up roughly where he

1480.399 --> 1489.299
started oh he died didn't he like he

1487.75 --> 1494.139
didn't make it to the end

1489.299 --> 1496.809
not enough lemons alright maybe not even

1494.139 --> 1498.879
any lemons I'm not sure I don't remember

1496.809 --> 1503.95
it's a long time ago I think lemons were

1498.879 --> 1506.23
later Magellan I think he was Portuguese

1503.95 --> 1508.5900000000001
they were not exactly all about the

1506.23 --> 1508.59
lemons

1511.62 --> 1514.79
[Music]

1519.2 --> 1524.3
but I'm still I am still glad I

1521.82 --> 1530.58
remembered that stuff even though it's

1524.3 --> 1533.96
25 or more years ago 26 years ago

1530.58 --> 1533.96
something like that

1545.159 --> 1556.8400000000001
Egyptian seal around Africa did they

1548.679 --> 1561.8090000000002
dough did they end up like in a way for

1556.84 --> 1565.4189999999999
Egypt if it was kind of roughly the

1561.809 --> 1568.36
landmass and all that it is now then it

1565.419 --> 1573.1000000000001
would have like the Strait of Hormuz one

1568.36 --> 1575.59
side and the what is it the

1573.1 --> 1578.8899999999999
Mediterranean Sea on the other side well

1575.59 --> 1581.3799999999999
it could be useful for the Egyptians

1578.89 --> 1584.919
back then to have tried to sail around

1581.38 --> 1587.23
it even though I I'd almost think that

1584.919 --> 1591.159
they would probably be more inclined to

1587.23 --> 1595.659
just figure out a land transport way as

1591.159 --> 1600.279
an alternative to to a channel like the

1595.659 --> 1601.659
channel like what is it the ADI the

1600.279 --> 1606.72
biggest channel in the world

1601.659 --> 1608.919
between america or was it again in

1606.72 --> 1611.799
nicaragua or something there that big

1608.919 --> 1613.8990000000001
thing that enables people to move

1611.799 --> 1615.37
through the Americas instead of all the

1613.899 --> 1618.85
way around it every time they want to go

1615.37 --> 1621.789
past so I could forget the name but

1618.85 --> 1625.6299999999999
maybe the Egyptians found a way out to

1621.789 --> 1628.149
basically get boats like roll them on

1625.63 --> 1632.38
land and then I don't know slide them

1628.149 --> 1635.1399999999999
over to the other side from one ocean to

1632.38 --> 1637.8400000000001
the other yet the Suez Canal that was

1635.14 --> 1644.23
the one that was referred to earlier so

1637.84 --> 1646.57
or the Panama Canal right but anyway

1644.23 --> 1650.409
that wasn't there yet at least as far as

1646.57 --> 1654.85
we know things get a bit confusing

1650.409 --> 1658.3300000000002
though but and yeah so the idea pians

1654.85 --> 1663.07
might might have sailed around the

1658.33 --> 1669.46
entirety of of africa they thought it

1663.07 --> 1671.26
was a worthy exploration or or or they

1669.46 --> 1674.409
didn't and they just figured out a way

1671.26 --> 1676.75
to to quickly relatively efficiently

1674.409 --> 1678.0800000000002
transport boats from the strait of

1676.75 --> 1680.24
hormuz

1678.08 --> 1683.809
to the other side in the the

1680.24 --> 1687.23
Mediterranean Sea I don't know I've

1683.809 --> 1689.87
never been in a historical expert at

1687.23 --> 1691.82
those details I just try to figure out

1689.87 --> 1695.7199999999998
like yeah what is it like what would I

1691.82 --> 1698.12
do you know all people or rulers they

1695.72 --> 1700.07
always want to use the most efficient

1698.12 --> 1702.9799999999998
high-tech thing so what could they have

1700.07 --> 1706.4289999999999
come up with back then with what was

1702.98 --> 1710.45
there including the things that we are

1706.429 --> 1712.19
overlooking and trying to imagine that

1710.45 --> 1714.529
some things may not have happened that

1712.19 --> 1717.3200000000002
have been later fabricated on top of it

1714.529 --> 1719.33
as part of our programming taking every

1717.32 --> 1721.49
as much as I can into account I kind of

1719.33 --> 1725.71
just try to think what it's like and

1721.49 --> 1727.85
what they could come up with anyway I

1725.71 --> 1730.3990000000001
guess it would be more effective to

1727.85 --> 1735.4399999999998
actually dig into the research the

1730.399 --> 1737.029
historical research yeah but I've never

1735.44 --> 1742.3890000000001
been too much about digging through

1737.029 --> 1742.389
books that I don't have anyway

1742.46 --> 1745.729
[Music]

1750.16 --> 1754.2
kind of question is that power of its

1757.41 --> 1766.8000000000002
now there's definitely an arc pretty

1761.64 --> 1768.93
sure there is an arc found wasn't it

1766.8 --> 1771.35
like on the top of a mountain in Turkey

1768.93 --> 1771.3500000000001
somewhere

1772.75 --> 1783.86
I'm not sure anyway like even if it was

1781.15 --> 1786.89
anywhere at any point during a

1783.86 --> 1791.059
historical time I would imagine that

1786.89 --> 1793.4
since it was made of wood that over the

1791.059 --> 1797.12
ages it would deteriorate and literally

1793.4 --> 1800.8090000000002
crumble anyway so you would maybe have

1797.12 --> 1805.2199999999998
traces of what powder left if it would

1800.809 --> 1807.77
be intact then I almost cannot imagine

1805.22 --> 1810.38
that over the ages there was not a

1807.77 --> 1812.75
single empire at some point that would

1810.38 --> 1816.71
just decide yeah we're gonna go there

1812.75 --> 1818.87
and we are gonna take that ship apart to

1816.71 --> 1822.3500000000001
use the parts of it I don't know for a

1818.87 --> 1824.84
temple of some kind maybe or for

1822.35 --> 1827.24
whatever purpose because that is

1824.84 --> 1830.1789999999999
typically what empires do they just say

1827.24 --> 1832.82
now screw everything unless it's just

1830.179 --> 1840.1100000000001
too holy to handle destroy and then

1832.82 --> 1843.9399999999998
reform make it into the Empire so if it

1840.11 --> 1848.4399999999998
was still somewhere literally almost

1843.94 --> 1855.3200000000002
recognizable I I'd be baffled for real

1848.44 --> 1861.38
but maybe it is but a Jamie as far as I

1855.32 --> 1864.26
heard heard not really tested it it was

1861.38 --> 1867.5
supposedly somewhere on a mountain in

1864.26 --> 1871.07
Turkey and I did see like satellite

1867.5 --> 1874.51
pictures but yeah is that real I don't

1871.07 --> 1874.51
know man I really don't

1890.45 --> 1899.1200000000001
right while Paul Roberts you can then in

1894.09 --> 1902.22
that case please take your yeah your

1899.12 --> 1902.6399999999999
specific non-christian belief somewhere

1902.22 --> 1904.41
else

1902.64 --> 1907.3200000000002
because we don't really care about

1904.41 --> 1908.19
people that think that Jesus is some

1907.32 --> 1909.8999999999999
kind of scammer

1908.19 --> 1914.3400000000001
or something you know to call him a

1909.9 --> 1918.0900000000001
magician is just really disgusting is it

1914.34 --> 1920.4599999999998
a magician if you figure out the path if

1918.09 --> 1923.31
you figure out creation itself and try

1920.46 --> 1927.6000000000001
to raise everyone and everything out of

1923.31 --> 1936.81
the darkness is that a magician is that

1927.6 --> 1938.6999999999998
a deceiver Paul Roberts it's extremely

1936.81 --> 1941.19
disrespectful no matter what you think

1938.7 --> 1951.3500000000001
of it no matter what you think of what

1941.19 --> 1951.3500000000001
he really was serious you know

1951.38 --> 1960.3200000000002
yeah yes I am but I'm eclectic and I'm

1957.71 --> 1962.8700000000001
figuring out my own way because there is

1960.32 --> 1967.6399999999999
deception in everything everywhere and

1962.87 --> 1974.83
everyone it's just you have to figure

1967.64 --> 1977.66
out which is which you know what yeah I

1974.83 --> 1981.74
absolutely I I believe there was a

1977.66 --> 1985.4
figure that was Jesus maybe even two I

1981.74 --> 1989.299
think there was a unique new tradition

1985.4 --> 1991.88
born out of that that later became

1989.299 --> 1993.74
transformed into Christianity a religion

1991.88 --> 1998.2700000000002
that it was really never supposed to

1993.74 --> 2000.49
become but it did like not like in a

1998.27 --> 2002.74
religion form it was supposed to be a

2000.49 --> 2005.679
personal spiritual to tradition because

2002.74 --> 2008.559
Christianity the more I've seen it the

2005.679 --> 2013.1200000000001
more I've heard about it more I just

2008.559 --> 2017.83
know it is a personal tradition the real

2013.12 --> 2020.9799999999998
church is you your your body and your

2017.83 --> 2024.76
spirit is of the Lord that you need to

2020.98 --> 2028.299
protect so I am much more in that sense

2024.76 --> 2032.02
an esoteric Christian which coincides a

2028.299 --> 2038.549
lot with the approach of Rudolf Steiner

2032.02 --> 2041.1399999999999
and the yeah the his traditions and

2038.549 --> 2046.6589999999999
culture that came out of it that is

2041.14 --> 2052.53
Christian in nature but it is also it

2046.659 --> 2058.54
also does drag in and say in a way like

2052.53 --> 2062.2900000000004
not worship but emphasize reverence for

2058.54 --> 2063.31
the Sun so in a way they do kind of

2062.29 --> 2066.82
esoterically

2063.31 --> 2069.909
equate Jesus and the God and creator

2066.82 --> 2072.52
with the Sun and that was kind of like

2069.909 --> 2076.179
hmm I don't know what to think about it

2072.52 --> 2079.169
and back then yeah like regular

2076.179 --> 2083.31
Christians you could call it they saw

2079.169 --> 2087.04
evil so you are trying to deceive

2083.31 --> 2088.87
because all regular Christians do that

2087.04 --> 2093.94
with freaking everything they don't

2088.87 --> 2098.31
understand everything so but yeah

2093.94 --> 2098.31
they're not they definitely do

2098.43 --> 2104.89
understand the path and the tests of

2101.86 --> 2108.01
creation and the personal relationship

2104.89 --> 2111.49
with God and even the ethereal body on

2108.01 --> 2115.1800000000003
the other side and all that it's all all

2111.49 --> 2119.08
the people there worked on that to no

2115.18 --> 2121.6299999999997
end in the background with books with

2119.08 --> 2124.33
basically counsel thinking about it

2121.63 --> 2128.79
their own way in the 20th century and it

2124.33 --> 2132.91
was all all swept aside it's been almost

2128.79 --> 2135.64
completely ignored by the conscious

2132.91 --> 2137.35
world even though it's been there for

2135.64 --> 2142.33
over 80 years

2137.35 --> 2146.89
oh no way it's pretty much yeah over 80

2142.33 --> 2149.7999999999997
years who knows about this you ever

2146.89 --> 2153.8399999999997
heard about this through any kind of

2149.8 --> 2161.0800000000004
mainstream thing ever ever nope

2153.84 --> 2162.8500000000004
never I never have ever you got to find

2161.08 --> 2165.7
it you got to find it and then you'll

2162.85 --> 2174.46
know it's there if you don't go looking

2165.7 --> 2177.85
for it you don't find it so anyway yeah

2174.46 --> 2181.05
Tanya West absolutely eclecticism and

2177.85 --> 2186.52
Christianity go together there are so

2181.05 --> 2188.4100000000003
essentially intertwined the - yeah you

2186.52 --> 2193.27
could not be more wrong with that

2188.41 --> 2195.67
statement you could not be more wrong

2193.27 --> 2199.95
with that statement eclecticism and

2195.67 --> 2203.32
christianity go together like one

2199.95 --> 2206.9199999999996
absolutely they do collective system

2203.32 --> 2212.52
simply means you teach yourself that

2206.92 --> 2215.4
means that you use yourself as well

2212.52 --> 2218.22
as a social authority Oh for determining

2215.4 --> 2221.4300000000003
what is real and what is not now of

2218.22 --> 2224.3399999999997
course if you cannot wield your own ego

2221.43 --> 2226.83
in the face of that yeah you'll go crazy

2224.34 --> 2228.36
and you'll start to disconnect more and

2226.83 --> 2230.7
more and more in your eclectic wrote

2228.36 --> 2232.44
until nobody understands you anymore and

2230.7 --> 2234.21
then they'll probably see you as a

2232.44 --> 2237.0
lunatic and then you may effectively

2234.21 --> 2239.31
become a lunatic but if you can actually

2237.0 --> 2242.34
manage to handle your ego throughout the

2239.31 --> 2245.5099999999998
process then you can simply carefully

2242.34 --> 2251.61
reflect what you've learned on

2245.51 --> 2254.4300000000003
everything without polarizing everything

2251.61 --> 2257.85
and that is kind of what I've been

2254.43 --> 2260.04
trying to do in my own way because the

2257.85 --> 2264.27
polarization literally destroys

2260.04 --> 2269.0299999999997
understanding it overlooks that

2264.27 --> 2274.64
basically everyone everyone ever always

2269.03 --> 2281.3700000000003
has to them good reasons why they do it

2274.64 --> 2284.3399999999997
or they wouldn't do it now people can do

2281.37 --> 2287.0699999999997
disturbing things in in moments where

2284.34 --> 2290.2200000000003
they have barely any conscious but even

2287.07 --> 2295.52
that is there for a reason it came to

2290.22 --> 2295.52
that for some reason so

2303.92 --> 2309.9300000000003
yeah that's right phone each Christ

2306.09 --> 2312.0
wasn't Christian and the Christianity as

2309.93 --> 2315.1099999999997
a religion wasn't even there yet

2312.0 --> 2319.92
Christ was pretty much against Church

2315.11 --> 2322.6200000000003
against giving yeah the authority of God

2319.92 --> 2326.04
to another person he he championed that

2322.62 --> 2329.99
very concept to take away priesthood

2326.04 --> 2336.09
power of the spirit that was this

2329.99 --> 2338.8799999999997
primary objective to take away the the

2336.09 --> 2343.04
temple in an exoteric sense and put the

2338.88 --> 2345.78
temple back in the body to make the

2343.04 --> 2348.17
individual take responsibility for their

2345.78 --> 2351.0
own and therefore getting in a direct

2348.17 --> 2354.42
connection with God instead of through

2351.0 --> 2357.72
an organization that is prone to abuse

2354.42 --> 2359.85
you eventually which is what kind of

2357.72 --> 2362.81
inevitably always happens with all those

2359.85 --> 2365.52
with religious institutes in general and

2362.81 --> 2369.5099999999998
you can't even say that the people

2365.52 --> 2373.97
within it always meant that to do that

2369.51 --> 2376.92
it's just that it's a setup that causes

2373.97 --> 2380.0099999999998
aberrant power abuse it just it's

2376.92 --> 2382.98
doesn't it's a side effect it slips in

2380.01 --> 2385.53
the darkness just slips in because there

2382.98 --> 2390.21
is a power technically where there

2385.53 --> 2393.3900000000003
should be none why because Christ knew

2390.21 --> 2395.79
that he knew that that would happen and

2393.39 --> 2397.3799999999997
he's probably seen it even back then

2395.79 --> 2399.72
with the old religions and the

2397.38 --> 2402.4500000000003
priesthoods that were around back then

2399.72 --> 2405.2999999999997
that it just happens the darkness slips

2402.45 --> 2407.6099999999997
into them into the priests because

2405.3 --> 2409.8
because of the power they've they are

2407.61 --> 2412.17
given by the people that basically

2409.8 --> 2414.9900000000002
surrender their spiritual sovereignty to

2412.17 --> 2417.87
them and then the power challenges those

2414.99 --> 2421.1699999999996
people lucifer slips in and takes over

2417.87 --> 2422.97
and then it becomes a power abuse set up

2421.17 --> 2424.7400000000002
and the people wielding that power no

2422.97 --> 2427.89
longer care really about the well-being

2424.74 --> 2429.6299999999997
they just care about making sure they

2427.89 --> 2432.96
maintain the power and that the people

2429.63 --> 2435.0
will have their mind their way under

2432.96 --> 2437.67
air control that is what becomes the

2435.0 --> 2440.46
steering factor instead of actually

2437.67 --> 2444.96
helping the people find spiritual

2440.46 --> 2452.51
freedom and Christ knew this that's why

2444.96 --> 2456.27
he said churches temples surrendering

2452.51 --> 2460.4100000000003
your spirit and your relationship with

2456.27 --> 2461.609
God to another leads to the devil or

2460.41 --> 2464.79
they probably didn't say it like that

2461.609 --> 2467.5499999999997
I'm sorry if I'm not quote he probably

2464.79 --> 2475.04
reduced much more literal better word

2467.55 --> 2475.04
and roughly describing it so yeah

2482.13 --> 2484.789
yeah

2490.12 --> 2495.3399999999997
all right Paul Paul rubbish you don't

2492.43 --> 2497.35
even know it's ridiculous the things

2495.34 --> 2499.1200000000003
that you're saying and you're telling us

2497.35 --> 2502.39
we reject all history

2499.12 --> 2505.12
well you're rejecting the official body

2502.39 --> 2508.47
of history or there is great division

2505.12 --> 2511.69
among historians and researchers and

2508.47 --> 2516.3399999999997
record keepers was a great division

2511.69 --> 2518.86
between atheists known atheists because

2516.34 --> 2521.38
the Atheist literally want to just say

2518.86 --> 2523.9900000000002
this is [ __ ] this is not what it

2521.38 --> 2526.69
says because it would lend to much

2523.99 --> 2531.31
support to something deep we don't want

2526.69 --> 2534.4900000000002
to be real but yeah that's really nice

2531.31 --> 2536.97
if you latch onto that yeah but then you

2534.49 --> 2539.68
are literally ignoring all the

2536.97 --> 2542.4399999999996
historians that are not like that and

2539.68 --> 2544.87
that are actually putting the puzzle

2542.44 --> 2548.83
pieces together of how those things

2544.87 --> 2551.44
really did happen how miraculous moments

2548.83 --> 2555.49
were really there with historical

2551.44 --> 2558.16
reference so it seems like you're the

2555.49 --> 2561.04
one that's ignoring history Paul Roberts

2558.16 --> 2563.08
I know

2561.04 --> 2569.68
tiny Womble but I'm addressing him

2563.08 --> 2572.92
because he's talking in my chat oh whoa

2569.68 --> 2575.22
it's already three o'clock how time is

2572.92 --> 2575.2200000000003
flown

2578.83 --> 2587.0
[Music]

2590.09 --> 2599.1000000000004
911s check what you're talking about 911

2593.01 --> 2603.32
why oh by the way 9/11 is probably the

2599.1 --> 2603.3199999999997
birthday of Jesus Christ originally so

2613.92 --> 2618.4300000000003
I'm not saying you're not entitled to

2616.39 --> 2622.56
your opinion but that doesn't make you

2618.43 --> 2628.5
impervious to then getting responses in

2622.56 --> 2628.5
detail to that opinion if you don't mind

2642.29 --> 2647.5
oh you did Wow

2651.23 --> 2657.73
I could say some very inappropriate

2653.96 --> 2657.73
things in response to that but I won't

2659.2 --> 2666.3799999999997
just I hope he realizes what I guess

2663.53 --> 2668.869
what Saturn typically symbolically

2666.38 --> 2673.67
equates to to the people that actually

2668.869 --> 2678.1600000000003
wield the freaking space fantasy for the

2673.67 --> 2678.16
believers just saying

2681.06 --> 2684.15
[Music]

2704.67 --> 2713.64
Oh God

2710.75 --> 2717.0
yeah Paul Robert if you are actually in

2713.64 --> 2719.18
a satellite on its way to Saturn then it

2717.0 --> 2726.329
would be nice if you could open up a

2719.18 --> 2729.299
Skype conversation maybe but yeah I'm

2726.329 --> 2733.53
sure you Paul I'm sure you built a what

2729.299 --> 2737.28
you think is a satellite with

2733.53 --> 2740.549
functioning receivers sender well that

2737.28 --> 2743.0690000000004
and then you've been convinced that it

2740.549 --> 2747.15
was indeed sent to Saturn and you

2743.069 --> 2751.91
probably saw some readout on a screen

2747.15 --> 2754.38
that was telling you that in

2751.91 --> 2756.39
presupposing a coordinate system based

2754.38 --> 2760.65
on the heliocentric model that it was

2756.39 --> 2763.94
indeed going there I bet that it was

2760.65 --> 2763.94
very convincing to you

2771.65 --> 2779.549
anyway this is a conversation oh I think

2777.779 --> 2783.42
I'm gonna round out the show sorry for

2779.549 --> 2786.71
