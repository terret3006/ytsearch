416.479 --> 422.479
the day before

418.56 --> 424.56
benjamin was like yes because

422.479 --> 427.28
yeah yeah i'm rounding out right and

424.56 --> 431.68
then he went on for like 20 more minutes

427.28 --> 434.79999999999995
he got stuck in hilarious

431.68 --> 436.08
setup acting like obama bob dylan and

434.8 --> 439.199
president of

436.08 --> 443.44
trump basically

439.199 --> 443.44
he couldn't stop it so funny

444.88 --> 448.24
like i'm i'm almost wishing he's going

446.56 --> 450.08
to make or that

448.24 --> 452.40000000000003
mountain bear or something it's going to

450.08 --> 454.71999999999997
make a cartoon of that

452.4 --> 454.71999999999997
huh

456.4 --> 460.96
good for you my brother uh what

463.28 --> 483.599
should i be checking my paypal

478.639 --> 486.0
yeah thank you very much dank

483.599 --> 488.639
that's awesome thank you very much for

486.0 --> 488.639
your support

490.8 --> 493.84000000000003
that really helps

500.8 --> 503.599
thank you very much

504.4 --> 509.039
so yeah yesterday no more newspaper

506.639 --> 509.039
rounds

510.879 --> 514.479
kind of weird to realize that because

512.479 --> 518.32
i've been doing that for

514.479 --> 521.839
four years five years that's weird like

518.32 --> 521.839
yeah that doesn't

522.88 --> 530.8
but yeah better i'm not

526.24 --> 532.88
all that sorry uh

530.8 --> 534.0
i wonder if it's even gonna make any

532.88 --> 537.68
kind of difference or

534.0 --> 539.279
apparent difference for my financial

537.68 --> 549.8389999999999
situation

539.279 --> 549.8389999999999
we'll see anyway

553.839 --> 559.12
so yeah anything if you would like me to

560.839 --> 566.48
address

562.56 --> 566.4799999999999
i'm pretty much a blank slate right now

569.12 --> 578.88
but you think passed by

576.0 --> 580.959
really really need to learn to just keep

578.88 --> 583.519
making notes

580.959 --> 586.0
it's weird because there's a lot of

583.519 --> 589.6
things going through my mind and like

586.0 --> 591.36
funny sayings that i just spontaneously

589.6 --> 592.88
come up with in the evening

591.36 --> 594.399
and then i always assume that i'll

592.88 --> 597.04
remember everything

594.399 --> 598.399
well i don't and that's why i should

597.04 --> 601.92
make notes

598.399 --> 604.959
i got a new note block

601.92 --> 606.88
shouldn't really i

604.959 --> 608.8
skipped doing that for like two or three

606.88 --> 611.04
weeks and now i really need to get it

608.8 --> 611.04
back

611.6 --> 615.76
back to discipline to start doing doing

613.68 --> 619.8389999999999
that again

615.76 --> 619.8389999999999
because it was very effective

627.839 --> 635.0400000000001
and tony whitcomb

631.839 --> 636.8000000000001
yesterday like recommended this movie to

635.04 --> 640.3199999999999
me

636.8 --> 642.4799999999999
and now i'm like kind of having

640.32 --> 646.1600000000001
question marks towards him because like

642.48 --> 649.6
that movie

646.16 --> 654.399
technically well crafted but it was like

649.6 --> 657.6
a terrible movie like a really grim

654.399 --> 661.68
really really really grim and not

657.6 --> 664.16
like cartoonish but just like

661.68 --> 665.1999999999999
messed up in every way you could think

664.16 --> 674.959
of

665.2 --> 676.8000000000001
what i'm not even gonna mention the name

674.959 --> 678.399
what's up with the weird thumbnails

676.8 --> 680.16
recently in my channel yeah steamy

678.399 --> 683.36
traveler that's

680.16 --> 686.8389999999999
sort of a new project

683.36 --> 688.0790000000001
that nathan kind of came up with and

686.839 --> 690.6400000000001
adam

688.079 --> 692.3199999999999
is chipping in and so they're making

690.64 --> 695.68
thumbnails

692.32 --> 702.0790000000001
and hey i think it's kind of fun like i

695.68 --> 704.079
myself i

702.079 --> 705.3599999999999
i don't really feel like doing that

704.079 --> 707.68
never really did

705.36 --> 710.0790000000001
always found it very difficult to come

707.68 --> 713.5999999999999
up with a thumbnail

710.079 --> 716.56
uh during the flat earth talks time

713.6 --> 717.9200000000001
when i was doing a show almost once a

716.56 --> 721.8389999999999
week

717.92 --> 726.8
then i would spend quite a lot of time

721.839 --> 729.7600000000001
thinking up what could

726.8 --> 732.079
i do card but it's just i never got good

729.76 --> 732.079
at it

738.399 --> 743.2
right but yeah they are a bit attention

740.32 --> 746.48
grabby and that's kind of on purpose

743.2 --> 751.36
just this

746.48 --> 753.6800000000001
is a kind of a colloquial experiment

751.36 --> 755.76
and some of the shows really got a

753.68 --> 760.6389999999999
massive pile of views

755.76 --> 760.639
compared to well the norm

761.76 --> 772.8
i could specially show 953

766.48 --> 776.0
and 952

772.8 --> 780.16
but yeah yesterday show already just

776.0 --> 782.8
typically exceeds the norm

780.16 --> 785.36
so i don't know who all these extra

782.8 --> 788.079
people are that are clicking on it

785.36 --> 791.519
it might be that it's just working on

788.079 --> 791.519
the ballers or something

798.839 --> 801.839
oh

805.36 --> 815.839
i'm crazy which tony

810.32 --> 815.839
hey jim

816.56 --> 821.92
cheapen the integrity of my show well

819.6 --> 825.44
the show is technically still the same

821.92 --> 828.88
right and to be fair

825.44 --> 831.36
having the exact same picture

828.88 --> 834.639
like almost a thousand times kind of

831.36 --> 834.639
gets a little stale

840.839 --> 843.839
right

848.32 --> 852.72
what no i don't know

854.0 --> 857.839
hey jim do you mean that guy

859.44 --> 864.0790000000001
that good servant really got into for a

861.76 --> 864.079
while

864.56 --> 867.8389999999999
going after everybody and getting all

866.8 --> 870.88
creepy

867.839 --> 873.519
that tony he happens to be called tony

870.88 --> 876.24
there's many many many tonys out there

873.519 --> 878.72
ajm just saying tony is not really

876.24 --> 878.72
helpful

879.199 --> 881.4399999999999
right

882.24 --> 887.279
britney yes steamy traveler but come on

885.04 --> 888.959
what is more attention grabby and

887.279 --> 899.8389999999999
clickbaity than that

888.959 --> 899.8389999999999
right it's on purpose

904.24 --> 911.199
i mean come on sometimes you just gotta

908.079 --> 916.0
joke around a little and i

911.199 --> 916.0
did actually talk about brittany okay

922.88 --> 926.16
all right hello geogene

927.44 --> 941.839
also tear it 306.

942.639 --> 945.519
times what

945.92 --> 952.0
whose wife oh

949.04 --> 955.8389999999999
elon you mean i don't even know who his

952.0 --> 955.839
wife is

961.92 --> 966.8389999999999
right but hey we can talk about whatever

964.48 --> 969.839
now steamy traveler hey if you want me

966.839 --> 972.0790000000001
to

969.839 --> 974.24
get more serious well you know what to

972.079 --> 974.2399999999999
do

974.32 --> 978.24
always the one to ask great questions

976.88 --> 983.8389999999999
and to break

978.24 --> 983.839
open subjects that i can work with so

1020.72 --> 1025.839
right or not

1035.28 --> 1039.839
hey seeking star wars

1041.839 --> 1049.4389999999999
come on not petty it just

1046.16 --> 1049.439
look technically

1049.919 --> 1056.96
you know i agree with steamy traveler

1053.76 --> 1058.64
it's just that i know that when some

1056.96 --> 1062.559
people

1058.64 --> 1066.4
that i respect get that impulse of like

1062.559 --> 1069.44
okay you got it just like

1066.4 --> 1070.4
change something and you got to let that

1069.44 --> 1073.6000000000001
happen right

1070.4 --> 1075.039
and if it's like really you do that you

1073.6 --> 1076.9599999999998
start doing that and it feels

1075.039 --> 1078.96
starts to feel like this is bad like i

1076.96 --> 1082.08
don't want this anymore

1078.96 --> 1083.76
then you stop but hey it might just rub

1082.08 --> 1085.6789999999999
off

1083.76 --> 1087.039
and maybe it could turn into something

1085.679 --> 1088.96
better right like

1087.039 --> 1090.799
it started out like let's be as

1088.96 --> 1094.799
attention grabby as possible

1090.799 --> 1098.48
and silly well not stupid

1094.799 --> 1100.72
but still very attention and then

1098.48 --> 1102.08
maneuver from there on and who knows

1100.72 --> 1104.48
what what type of

1102.08 --> 1106.8799999999999
title cards idols will come out of it

1104.48 --> 1106.88
eventually

1107.28 --> 1113.52
but technically you guys

1110.559 --> 1113.52
could help me too

1119.44 --> 1137.8400000000001
hey kristen good see you

1138.64 --> 1145.5200000000002
well eugene i don't know if they

1141.84 --> 1148.24
actually really checked on anything

1145.52 --> 1148.96
i think that richard branson and crew

1148.24 --> 1153.2
are just

1148.96 --> 1157.039
too busy making money doing the project

1153.2 --> 1157.039
and having some kind of

1157.6 --> 1161.36
influence doing that

1163.2 --> 1168.48
i don't even know if they if they care

1169.679 --> 1172.88
and that comes for a lot of people like

1172.08 --> 1175.1999999999998
that are really

1172.88 --> 1177.679
doing bigger things getting a lot of it

1175.2 --> 1180.799
and spending a lot of money

1177.679 --> 1185.039
like they probably don't care

1180.799 --> 1188.48
at all about whether the earth is

1185.039 --> 1191.36
flat or low they're not actually curious

1188.48 --> 1193.76
to check it they're just they're just

1191.36 --> 1198.9599999999998
there to

1193.76 --> 1198.96
execute the program as they've

1199.919 --> 1205.2800000000002
they've planned it out right

1203.2 --> 1207.2
and if part of that program is to

1205.28 --> 1210.0
reinforce oh look it's a globe

1207.2 --> 1210.32
it's a globe then they'll just say that

1210.0 --> 1212.88
i

1210.32 --> 1214.0
i very much doubt that they actually

1212.88 --> 1216.3200000000002
care

1214.0 --> 1217.76
right they're way too invested in what

1216.32 --> 1221.12
they're doing

1217.76 --> 1223.6
they care

1221.12 --> 1225.28
you really think that they would spend

1223.6 --> 1230.48
money

1225.28 --> 1230.48
to actually try and prove it's a glow

1232.84 --> 1238.72
now

1234.0 --> 1241.28
so the objectives just something else

1238.72 --> 1241.28
probably

1242.24 --> 1249.28
industrial encouragement in ways

1245.84 --> 1253.28
inspiring certain engineers perhaps

1249.28 --> 1255.6
right but not whether to prove

1253.28 --> 1258.0
whether it is flat or globe like that's

1255.6 --> 1260.559
not a genuine curiosity i think any of

1258.0 --> 1264.08
those people

1260.559 --> 1264.08
in the virgin galactic hat

1265.84 --> 1268.8799999999999
like there's probably no footage

1268.08 --> 1270.8799999999999
whatsoever

1268.88 --> 1272.64
where they literally look out the window

1270.88 --> 1275.2800000000002
and really like have that

1272.64 --> 1277.039
like sharp looking like they're really

1275.28 --> 1280.48
like really

1277.039 --> 1284.1589999999999
detailing observing there's probably no

1280.48 --> 1286.72
footage of them actually doing that

1284.159 --> 1288.0800000000002
during that flight whatsoever yeah

1286.72 --> 1290.799
they'll be staring

1288.08 --> 1291.6789999999999
out there but they'll be more concerned

1290.799 --> 1295.039
about

1291.679 --> 1298.159
staring out there being filmed right

1295.039 --> 1302.32
instead of actually being caught sharply

1298.159 --> 1302.3200000000002
observing using observation skills

1302.559 --> 1308.0
because they don't care understand they

1306.08 --> 1310.799
don't actually care about

1308.0 --> 1310.799
what's out there

1314.72 --> 1321.3600000000001
right they probably care more for

1318.0 --> 1325.039
the sensation that they feel

1321.36 --> 1325.039
than what is actually out there

1327.28 --> 1334.72
right and that's right jameson brown

1331.52 --> 1337.6
they did go on an amusement ride it's a

1334.72 --> 1341.919
giant roller coaster without

1337.6 --> 1341.9189999999999
without a rail that's what they did

1345.28 --> 1361.84
hey slow mo moon buggy

1377.84 --> 1382.3999999999999
oh yeah a good servant see you there

1383.039 --> 1389.84
skipped over sorry

1404.64 --> 1409.919
yeah right now eugene is just squirting

1407.76 --> 1411.36
because he didn't actually listen to the

1409.919 --> 1415.679
detailed

1411.36 --> 1417.9189999999999
explanation that i gave i

1415.679 --> 1419.3600000000001
just saying oh they didn't look down no

1417.919 --> 1421.919
that's not what i said no they

1419.36 --> 1425.52
definitely looked out of the window

1421.919 --> 1428.24
but they were not engaging in actual

1425.52 --> 1429.039
detailed observation because you can see

1428.24 --> 1432.559
that

1429.039 --> 1434.8799999999999
somebody does that see it

1432.559 --> 1437.2
how they compose their eyes and their

1434.88 --> 1437.2
face

1438.88 --> 1444.24
and it's just obvious they don't have

1441.76 --> 1448.64
actual interest

1444.24 --> 1451.039
making it on the spot real observations

1448.64 --> 1452.24
they're probably more interested about

1451.039 --> 1455.44
oh we are

1452.24 --> 1458.32
in space and

1455.44 --> 1461.2
we could just believe it's a ball out

1458.32 --> 1464.6399999999999
there we're not actually gonna check

1461.2 --> 1467.279
like that right so they did look through

1464.64 --> 1470.3200000000002
those windows sure they did

1467.279 --> 1471.12
it's not like oh let's have a very very

1470.32 --> 1487.76
sharp

1471.12 --> 1491.039
analytical observation going now

1487.76 --> 1495.039
it's just refraction refraction

1491.039 --> 1498.48
so how does refraction work lynn merlo

1495.039 --> 1500.08
how does that work because

1498.48 --> 1502.0
i've looked up of something about

1500.08 --> 1504.48
refraction effects

1502.0 --> 1505.84
ashes and all that what i learned is

1504.48 --> 1510.24
that what refraction

1505.84 --> 1514.48
officially is in optics is things

1510.24 --> 1518.32
being apparently displaced in relation

1514.48 --> 1518.32
to the horizon right

1518.799 --> 1525.039
specifically in relation to the horizon

1522.0 --> 1529.039
not the horizon itself

1525.039 --> 1534.1589999999999
so how can then refraction

1529.039 --> 1537.039
explain the black swan where the horizon

1534.159 --> 1537.8400000000001
at pretty low observation height is just

1537.039 --> 1542.0
way

1537.84 --> 1545.4399999999998
way too far how does

1542.0 --> 1546.799
something displaced in relation to the

1545.44 --> 1549.279
horizon

1546.799 --> 1550.799
that presumed effect how is that

1549.279 --> 1554.24
supposed to cause

1550.799 --> 1559.679
the horizon to be way

1554.24 --> 1561.84
too far for the geometry to

1559.679 --> 1564.3200000000002
to to make the earth a globe how does

1561.84 --> 1564.32
that work

1565.919 --> 1571.8400000000001
lynn merlot it looks

1569.12 --> 1574.08
different on different well i think that

1571.84 --> 1576.3999999999999
my explanation was a little bit more

1574.08 --> 1579.1999999999998
detailed and elaborate

1576.4 --> 1581.2
yeah looks different look yeah that's

1579.2 --> 1584.96
cute

1581.2 --> 1588.24
but if refraction is gonna displace

1584.96 --> 1592.96
things in relation to the horizon then

1588.24 --> 1595.2
how can that make the horizon be visible

1592.96 --> 1599.6000000000001
far beyond what the geometry of

1595.2 --> 1602.48
presupposed ball earth would allow

1599.6 --> 1602.48
explain that to me

1610.32 --> 1614.559
alright matthew hall yeah i saw it live

1616.32 --> 1623.36
it's just mostly a bunch of blabbering

1619.6 --> 1625.6
girls and pretty makeup and all the

1623.36 --> 1628.3999999999999
black with a bunch of stars on their

1625.6 --> 1631.279
sleeves and all that just smiling all

1628.4 --> 1631.279
the time talking

1631.44 --> 1634.48
that was most of it

1635.76 --> 1644.559
i only got a few shots from the inside

1641.2 --> 1646.96
but yeah they did not go to space yet

1644.559 --> 1648.96
i'm not even sure if they claimed it

1646.96 --> 1651.919
they might have haphazardly just

1648.96 --> 1651.919
sorta claimed it

1652.84 --> 1660.6399999999999
but kind of silly to claim that when

1656.64 --> 1664.3200000000002
officially they couldn't have had

1660.64 --> 1664.3200000000002
and have went to space

1664.64 --> 1669.8400000000001
that's not where space is officially so

1670.799 --> 1677.279
don't see the horizon just

1674.159 --> 1680.8400000000001
see a mirror what

1677.279 --> 1684.72
you don't see the horizon

1680.84 --> 1689.12
wow uh

1684.72 --> 1692.0
i'm pretty sure that if you see

1689.12 --> 1692.799
if you have eyes when optics applies

1692.0 --> 1696.0
yeah you do

1692.799 --> 1699.2
see the horizon

1696.0 --> 1699.2
you absolutely do

1702.72 --> 1706.48
that's really weird thing to say

1706.64 --> 1714.24
right remember

1711.12 --> 1717.36
mirages are things displaced

1714.24 --> 1721.6
in relation to the horizon but

1717.36 --> 1724.6399999999999
the horizon itself does not displace

1721.6 --> 1727.6789999999999
as part of the the effect

1724.64 --> 1739.8400000000001
that the effect cannot

1727.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
cannot achieve that

1751.52 --> 1754.799
well no tom parker

1756.64 --> 1758.88
no

1760.399 --> 1767.84
this time bending gravity does not

1762.72 --> 1767.84
really have anything to do with it

1792.08 --> 1795.84
okay matthew hall

1797.039 --> 1805.12
sure although i find it kind of freaky

1801.52 --> 1808.24
that you would associate virgins

1805.12 --> 1809.6789999999999
as in people who've never had sex before

1808.24 --> 1813.1200000000001
in space

1809.679 --> 1816.24
as sexual i find that kind of weird

1813.12 --> 1818.799
maybe that's the creepy thing

1816.24 --> 1818.799
not sure

1821.279 --> 1829.2
i i think that's mostly you

1824.64 --> 1829.2
because i don't associate virgins with

1830.72 --> 1841.999
that's exactly the opposite but

1837.78 --> 1841.999
[Music]

1842.96 --> 1849.039
how does flat earth explain sunrises and

1846.32 --> 1849.039
sunsets

1849.52 --> 1854.72
how does it explain noon display well

1857.279 --> 1863.12
you have the lights and

1861.039 --> 1864.96
they are visible at a certain angle in

1863.12 --> 1866.559
relation to the observer's position on

1864.96 --> 1871.519
the earth

1866.559 --> 1871.519
and yeah and it's flat

1872.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
there you go

1895.6 --> 1910.6399999999999
indeed seeking star wars it does

1906.72 --> 1914.08
like even all the reflections

1910.64 --> 1915.679
of the sun and the moon especially when

1914.08 --> 1918.1589999999999
it gets darker

1915.679 --> 1919.1200000000001
on the ocean right wherever you are on

1918.159 --> 1923.7600000000002
the ocean

1919.12 --> 1927.6789999999999
the reflections of it are distinctly

1923.76 --> 1927.679
a reflection of a flat surface

1932.84 --> 1935.84
right

1944.32 --> 1950.96
how do you explain lin merlot

1947.36 --> 1953.76
wow that's hilarious how do you

1950.96 --> 1954.72
explain that the horizon is far too far

1953.76 --> 1959.36
to see

1954.72 --> 1962.32
why does it apparently change position

1959.36 --> 1964.6399999999999
well on a flat earth there's no

1962.32 --> 1966.72
objection to this it's called

1964.64 --> 1968.0800000000002
weather conditions right there's

1966.72 --> 1970.96
something called

1968.08 --> 1970.96
refraction

1971.84 --> 1975.12
just general air refraction it blurs up

1974.559 --> 1979.039
things

1975.12 --> 1981.6789999999999
right it's like the limit to it it

1979.039 --> 1982.24
decreases the limit to sight based on

1981.679 --> 1986.159
how much

1982.24 --> 1986.159
moist is in the air for example

1986.559 --> 1991.44
and the temperature has an influence and

1989.2 --> 1994.799
yeah under certain conditions

1991.44 --> 1997.2
the horizon will appear to be closer by

1994.799 --> 1999.36
because you literally cannot observe

1997.2 --> 2001.3600000000001
things beyond it

1999.36 --> 2003.12
even if they are there and they might

2001.36 --> 2006.32
even be

2003.12 --> 2007.039
angular size wise big enough to be

2006.32 --> 2008.8799999999999
perceived

2007.039 --> 2010.64
it's just you're it's not going to reach

2008.88 --> 2014.3200000000002
you it's going to be blurred up

2010.64 --> 2015.76
and it just be dissolved in a universal

2014.32 --> 2018.799
colored soup

2015.76 --> 2022.32
because it's all too diffused

2018.799 --> 2026.0
refracted to be visible and that's why

2022.32 --> 2028.799
some days on that plane the horizon

2026.0 --> 2030.84
seems closer to you than on other days

2028.799 --> 2035.12
when it's much clearer

2030.84 --> 2038.6399999999999
right that's no problem on a flat earth

2035.12 --> 2042.08
that's very easily explained

2038.64 --> 2045.679
on a ball however

2042.08 --> 2049.2
that's a big big problem because the

2045.679 --> 2050.48
horizon on a ball earth is not merely

2049.2 --> 2053.5989999999997
optical

2050.48 --> 2054.159
there's actually a geometrical horizon

2053.599 --> 2056.48
there

2054.159 --> 2057.9190000000003
because it's a physical geometry you're

2056.48 --> 2061.44
standing on

2057.919 --> 2062.879
it's a ball so the horizon is not merely

2061.44 --> 2066.079
going to be limited

2062.879 --> 2069.2799999999997
to your line of sight

2066.079 --> 2071.44
it's going to have to be capped by

2069.28 --> 2073.119
the limitations of the spherical

2071.44 --> 2076.32
geometry

2073.119 --> 2079.76
and that sort of horizon

2076.32 --> 2079.76
that cannot be displaced

2080.32 --> 2086.7200000000003
that's impossible right

2084.32 --> 2088.079
on a flat earth it's no problem horizon

2086.72 --> 2092.1589999999997
can seem very close

2088.079 --> 2096.0
very far away is no issue on a ball

2092.159 --> 2099.04
that doesn't happen horizon

2096.0 --> 2102.24
visible horizon is not going to migrate

2099.04 --> 2103.2799999999997
beyond the geometric edge where it's

2102.24 --> 2109.4399999999996
supposed to cut

2103.28 --> 2109.44
things off cut off the site beyond its

2114.839 --> 2118.32
geometry

2116.4 --> 2120.48
explaining but refraction cannot

2118.32 --> 2121.6800000000003
displace the horizon in relation to the

2120.48 --> 2124.32
horizon already

2121.68 --> 2124.3199999999997
told you this

2128.0 --> 2134.56
it's not gonna move the horizon

2131.68 --> 2134.96
vertically in any form that doesn't

2134.56 --> 2136.72
happen

2134.96 --> 2138.48
refraction doesn't do that it only

2136.72 --> 2142.64
displaces

2138.48 --> 2146.8
objects within the field of view

2142.64 --> 2149.2
in relation to the horizon

2146.8 --> 2150.5600000000004
might go up might go down but the

2149.2 --> 2153.1189999999997
horizon itself

2150.56 --> 2153.119
does not

2154.8 --> 2159.8390000000004
your move lynn merlot

2166.21 --> 2169.36
[Music]

2171.42 --> 2175.07
[Music]

2177.64 --> 2180.719
[Music]

2184.839 --> 2187.839
hmm

2192.0 --> 2197.44
yeah i know i just explained that to you

2194.64 --> 2200.48
i also explained it cannot

2197.44 --> 2205.76
bend or displays

2200.48 --> 2208.64
the horizon you seem to be avoiding

2205.76 --> 2208.6400000000003
addressing that

2213.28 --> 2217.92
do we need to repeat it a couple of

2215.359 --> 2217.92
times more

2222.48 --> 2230.72
yeah i know limerlo wait

2227.119 --> 2230.7200000000003
no no actually that's wrong

2236.48 --> 2243.44
it cannot reveal no refraction does not

2239.92 --> 2246.56
reveal things that are geometrically

2243.44 --> 2250.64
blocked that

2246.56 --> 2253.839
doesn't actually happen isn't that funny

2250.64 --> 2258.72
right the actual sight

2253.839 --> 2258.72
on the object might be concealed

2259.76 --> 2263.8390000000004
and then a mirage or effect or something

2262.32 --> 2267.28
might be visible

2263.839 --> 2269.119
like above it for example but there has

2267.28 --> 2271.0400000000004
to be a straight line aside

2269.119 --> 2274.88
like in theory it would have to be

2271.04 --> 2278.4
possible to see the original location

2274.88 --> 2284.88
things don't actually mirror

2278.4 --> 2289.52
up or move up or stretch up beyond

2284.88 --> 2292.1600000000003
a hill when you look at a hill

2289.52 --> 2293.359
no matter how big that hill is it's

2292.16 --> 2296.7999999999997
earth-sized

2293.359 --> 2299.2
presumed if something is beyond the

2296.8 --> 2302.8
geometry then it cannot

2299.2 --> 2305.52
what is cut off geometrically from sight

2302.8 --> 2307.2000000000003
will not become visible under any

2305.52 --> 2312.4
circumstances

2307.2 --> 2315.7599999999998
that's impossible

2312.4 --> 2317.76
but whatever is visible without

2315.76 --> 2320.4
geometric concealment

2317.76 --> 2321.92
like like a hill getting in the way

2320.4 --> 2324.8
whatever is visible

2321.92 --> 2325.52
that part can displace you can displace

2324.8 --> 2328.7200000000003
upwards

2325.52 --> 2332.88
and it can displace downwards

2328.72 --> 2338.3999999999996
making even less of it visible right

2332.88 --> 2341.839
but the actual horizon itself

2338.4 --> 2341.839
is not displacing

2343.839 --> 2347.92
it inside see

2352.48 --> 2355.52
yeah that's so very cute light bends

2354.48 --> 2357.599
refract you out

2355.52 --> 2358.72
you kid you don't seem to be addressing

2357.599 --> 2362.6400000000003
the actual

2358.72 --> 2369.839
in the field practical hints

2362.64 --> 2369.839
that i'm giving you now lynn merlot

2370.26 --> 2373.309
[Music]

2380.839 --> 2383.839
oh

2421.44 --> 2426.56
yeah clutch where i get feeling myself

2434.88 --> 2439.6800000000003
uh no not really masturbate

2449.52 --> 2452.56
no tiny womble no good servant is

2452.0 --> 2455.04
actually

2452.56 --> 2456.16
right on the money there he's absolutely

2455.04 --> 2458.96
correct it is

2456.16 --> 2458.96
not called will it

2461.04 --> 2466.48
an occultation concealment

2464.72 --> 2468.56
for the consciousness is what the

2466.48 --> 2472.319
religion is all about

2468.56 --> 2475.7599999999998
you overlook things

2472.319 --> 2478.72
in order to maintain

2475.76 --> 2480.88
the possibility in your mind that the

2478.72 --> 2495.839
model works

2480.88 --> 2495.839
so occult religion is exactly what it is

2500.16 --> 2503.68
and i love by the way now that this is

2502.48 --> 2506.64
coming on

2503.68 --> 2506.96
coming afloat own benjamin is talking

2506.64 --> 2510.48
about

2506.96 --> 2510.48
oh god i almost forgot

2512.72 --> 2518.9599999999996
benjamin said that i was like

2517.04 --> 2521.599
[Music]

2518.96 --> 2523.839
he said that he doesn't think christ

2521.599 --> 2523.839
died

2524.16 --> 2530.72
oh and he

2527.2 --> 2535.2
he feels he feels it he's

2530.72 --> 2538.9599999999996
he feels it and that's exactly

2535.2 --> 2543.5989999999997
what i felt that's like

2538.96 --> 2545.359
holy [ __ ] i almost forgot about that but

2543.599 --> 2547.44
yeah i didn't mean to bring that up as a

2545.359 --> 2550.48
subject but yeah that

2547.44 --> 2552.64
he said it but

2550.48 --> 2553.839
he was he's been bringing up subjects

2552.64 --> 2556.96
about what

2553.839 --> 2557.599
occultism really is it's fascinating

2556.96 --> 2560.8
because he's

2557.599 --> 2562.0
like dead on target so on target it's

2560.8 --> 2563.599
incredible

2562.0 --> 2566.24
and i've been talking about it a little

2563.599 --> 2569.599
bit myself

2566.24 --> 2573.359
even referring to like controller elite

2569.599 --> 2577.3590000000004
now we project some kind of

2573.359 --> 2580.4
micro deity state of being on them

2577.359 --> 2582.7999999999997
in our imagination when in reality they

2580.4 --> 2584.96
probably know less than us

2582.8 --> 2586.88
right and open benjamin has another

2584.96 --> 2587.76
angle to that same mechanism that he

2586.88 --> 2590.88
explained

2587.76 --> 2593.44
about occultism that actual cult sexual

2590.88 --> 2595.76
secret societies

2593.44 --> 2598.64
they don't keep the secrets from the

2595.76 --> 2598.6400000000003
outside world

2598.8 --> 2602.6400000000003
secrets from themselves they keep

2601.92 --> 2607.28
secrets

2602.64 --> 2612.48
from themselves

2607.28 --> 2614.6400000000003
perfect fit it's it is that it is that

2612.48 --> 2620.079
so yeah owen benjamin's been quite

2614.64 --> 2623.52
exciting to watch for me recently

2620.079 --> 2626.319
especially when he said his feelings

2623.52 --> 2626.319
about christ

2626.64 --> 2635.839
it's like

2642.56 --> 2649.839
yeah i'm getting a rush even remembering

2652.75 --> 2658.82
[Music]

2670.079 --> 2675.44
pains require no belief no it actually

2673.04 --> 2678.88
requires a method

2675.44 --> 2684.0
and once you reject that method

2678.88 --> 2684.0
you bypass it james mason

2684.56 --> 2691.839
then it becomes a belief whether you

2687.599 --> 2691.839
recognize that it is or not

2695.119 --> 2701.6800000000003
and as soon as the empiricism is

2698.16 --> 2704.72
lost within science it

2701.68 --> 2706.48
becomes a belief it becomes an idea a

2704.72 --> 2710.0789999999997
concept

2706.48 --> 2713.52
that potentially could be reified or not

2710.079 --> 2714.6400000000003
but it's no longer science because the

2713.52 --> 2718.72
science

2714.64 --> 2722.7999999999997
specifically requires the empiricism

2718.72 --> 2724.7999999999997
and take it even more strictly

2722.8 --> 2725.8390000000004
it requires a natural occurring

2724.8 --> 2728.5600000000004
phenomena

2725.839 --> 2730.64
that you as the experimenter can

2728.56 --> 2733.119
manipulate in order to establish the

2730.64 --> 2736.4
cause of an effect

2733.119 --> 2736.96
right so as soon as that empirical

2736.4 --> 2739.6800000000003
element

2736.96 --> 2741.839
is lost for whatever reason it's no

2739.68 --> 2747.52
longer science it becomes belief

2741.839 --> 2750.7999999999997
and guess what a whole bunch of

2747.52 --> 2751.839
claimed to be scientific writings out

2750.8 --> 2754.8
there

2751.839 --> 2756.72
and theories that are not really

2754.8 --> 2758.8390000000004
scientific at all because they do not

2756.72 --> 2761.5989999999997
abide by the scientific method

2758.839 --> 2765.0
whatsoever

2761.599 --> 2768.0
actually pseudoscience are

2765.0 --> 2771.359
perpetuated by belief

2768.0 --> 2774.4
in them obviously not by

2771.359 --> 2775.68
actual testing abiding by the scientific

2774.4 --> 2779.52
method because then

2775.68 --> 2780.48
the people that do that will inevitably

2779.52 --> 2788.96
find out that it

2780.48 --> 2803.839
is not scientific at all

2788.96 --> 2803.839
hey rob h good to see you

2827.04 --> 2831.599
right yeah tarik 306 the whole world got

2830.16 --> 2833.52
inducted

2831.599 --> 2835.28
to the code of heliocentrism without

2833.52 --> 2836.16
knowing it and when you tell them they

2835.28 --> 2838.7200000000003
deny

2836.16 --> 2840.16
being part of it well they don't

2838.72 --> 2843.1189999999997
technically deny being

2840.16 --> 2845.68
part of it they just deny that it is a

2843.119 --> 2848.7200000000003
cult

2845.68 --> 2852.48
and by the way that's typically a cult

2848.72 --> 2855.359
if you deny it but you do not recognize

2852.48 --> 2855.92
the elements that make it a call then

2855.359 --> 2860.88
that is

2855.92 --> 2860.88
part of actual cults cultism

2868.0 --> 2874.88
basically late

2871.04 --> 2878.16
laden with

2874.88 --> 2880.6400000000003
dismissal without consideration of the

2878.16 --> 2880.64
evidence

2880.8 --> 2887.8390000000004
that's the cult does

2895.29 --> 2898.4
[Music]

2904.96 --> 2908.48
right good one dank religion is defined

2908.0 --> 2911.359
as a

2908.48 --> 2912.64
particular system of faith although

2911.359 --> 2915.92
religion does seem

2912.64 --> 2920.48
they have this tenacity

2915.92 --> 2923.04
tendency to always bring in a god

2920.48 --> 2924.64
somehow they always have to have a

2923.04 --> 2928.4
personified god that's what i

2924.64 --> 2932.5589999999997
keep finding in the definitions of it

2928.4 --> 2934.48
and i find that like unrelated

2932.559 --> 2937.3590000000004
disagree with that so yeah what the way

2934.48 --> 2937.359
that you're saying it

2937.68 --> 2943.839
just the system of faith that seems much

2940.0 --> 2943.839
more accurate

2964.559 --> 2973.92
right so most of the faith

2970.48 --> 2976.92
that the globe religion builds on

2973.92 --> 2978.559
are geometrical considerations and

2976.92 --> 2980.48
presuppositions

2978.559 --> 2983.599
right so it's not just straight out

2980.48 --> 2985.92
telling you you have to believe this

2983.599 --> 2987.119
you have to be they're just telling you

2985.92 --> 2991.52
but like

2987.119 --> 2994.559
think about it like this and then they

2991.52 --> 2996.8
don't snap you out of the consideration

2994.559 --> 2998.88
out of the mind experiment that's how

2996.8 --> 3002.0
they operate

2998.88 --> 3004.319
so certain considerations

3002.0 --> 3006.72
mind experiments are basically the

3004.319 --> 3009.359
foundation

3006.72 --> 3011.68
of what carries the entire religion

3009.359 --> 3013.92
narrative

3011.68 --> 3015.44
constantly considerations geometric

3013.92 --> 3018.16
considerations

3015.44 --> 3018.16
primarily

3021.839 --> 3028.4
just think of it as a globe

3025.28 --> 3028.4
that's the foundation

3032.64 --> 3036.319
vantage point of reasoning of

3034.72 --> 3041.839
conversation

3036.319 --> 3041.839
is think of it as a globe

3056.8 --> 3069.8390000000004
kristen i called

3070.0 --> 3073.839
look owen benjamin is just as much a

3072.48 --> 3078.2400000000002
cult

3073.839 --> 3083.839
as flat earth debates as a cult [ __ ]

3078.24 --> 3083.839
doesn't abide by the cult system

3086.48 --> 3090.48
right people like to call things a cult

3088.88 --> 3092.319
when they disagree

3090.48 --> 3094.2400000000002
with what they say right the known

3092.319 --> 3097.599
benjamin says for example there's no

3094.24 --> 3100.8799999999997
freaking moon landing

3097.599 --> 3100.88
the earth is not a globe

3102.319 --> 3106.079
and yeah that pisses off a whole bunch

3104.16 --> 3107.2799999999997
of people that's just one thing right

3106.079 --> 3110.6400000000003
because he touches

3107.28 --> 3113.44
everything else too

3110.64 --> 3115.44
and so people like to call him a cult

3113.44 --> 3118.96
it's total [ __ ]

3115.44 --> 3122.96
everybody has their own voices their own

3118.96 --> 3126.319
processes nobody's forced to do anything

3122.96 --> 3128.96
but there are just guidelines in how to

3126.319 --> 3128.96
go about

3133.359 --> 3139.839
everybody brings their own game

3150.16 --> 3156.16
i don't even know who's following it

3153.92 --> 3156.16
like

3164.96 --> 3169.2
it's more like a clown show right so if

3167.44 --> 3171.28
you have a certain type of clown and

3169.2 --> 3174.0
everybody thinks he's really funny

3171.28 --> 3175.52
for a lot of people apparently you keep

3174.0 --> 3177.599
watching that [ __ ]

3175.52 --> 3179.839
that doesn't automatically make them

3177.599 --> 3183.6800000000003
into a

3179.839 --> 3184.64
it's just a clown show does he actually

3183.68 --> 3187.2799999999997
make people

3184.64 --> 3187.2799999999997
do things

3189.28 --> 3192.6400000000003
does he like set out rules and people

3191.92 --> 3196.8
actually

3192.64 --> 3196.7999999999997
follow him in that

3197.119 --> 3200.559
i don't know i haven't really seen that

3198.88 --> 3200.96
i don't think that fight to flat earth

3200.559 --> 3209.8390000000004
even

3200.96 --> 3209.839
has that back really

3215.76 --> 3220.8390000000004
i mean if you can tell me how we in any

3219.04 --> 3223.599
form

3220.839 --> 3225.359
contributed to the integrity of the

3223.599 --> 3228.96
globe narrative

3225.359 --> 3229.52
let me know i haven't really come across

3228.96 --> 3231.599
anything

3229.52 --> 3233.599
like there's only one thing that i've

3231.599 --> 3237.599
ever heard out of him that kind of

3233.599 --> 3240.8
amused me and that i've adopted

3237.599 --> 3244.559
in my baldwin emulations

3240.8 --> 3247.3590000000004
and that is the anti-flat earth

3244.559 --> 3248.1600000000003
idea that the bending of space-time

3247.359 --> 3251.44
causes

3248.16 --> 3253.5989999999997
the emergent force of gravity

3251.44 --> 3255.44
i thought that that was amusing although

3253.599 --> 3255.92
i'm pretty sure that he didn't come up

3255.44 --> 3259.04
with that

3255.92 --> 3262.0
probably like i don't see him really as

3259.04 --> 3265.2
a guy that comes up with things right

3262.0 --> 3269.28
he's like simon dan in that like dude

3265.2 --> 3269.2799999999997
that guy is so preoccupied with

3269.359 --> 3275.2
really petty superficial mind control he

3271.839 --> 3278.0789999999997
doesn't have any creativity

3275.2 --> 3278.5589999999997
like all his creativity energy is pure

3278.079 --> 3280.96
gamma

3278.559 --> 3282.4
like there's no actual creativity coming

3280.96 --> 3284.96
out of that only

3282.4 --> 3286.64
creativity in how to tear things down in

3284.96 --> 3288.88
the moment

3286.64 --> 3293.839
terrible like that so he couldn't have

3288.88 --> 3293.839
come up with that himself

3301.68 --> 3309.7599999999998
because they are a communist

3304.799 --> 3309.7599999999998
terrorist organization that's why

3309.839 --> 3316.64
call that out a year ago they are

3313.44 --> 3318.799
there's blatantly obvious

3316.64 --> 3321.5989999999997
terrorist organization when you've ever

3318.799 --> 3324.64
seen one

3321.599 --> 3328.48
no i will not change the title

3324.64 --> 3328.96
i absolutely will not black lives matter

3328.48 --> 3332.48
is a

3328.96 --> 3332.48
terrorist organization

3332.799 --> 3336.799
right that doesn't mean that you're

3334.64 --> 3339.92
automatically a terrorist if you like

3336.799 --> 3341.2
are a part of it in some minor way and

3339.92 --> 3343.119
you thought that you were doing

3341.2 --> 3346.48
something nice

3343.119 --> 3349.76
guess what it's a really

3346.48 --> 3352.799
really dark group

3349.76 --> 3357.5200000000004
and they murder people and they

3352.799 --> 3357.52
cause massive massive damage

3358.559 --> 3365.28
it's [ __ ] up

3362.48 --> 3367.92
i will not change the title especially

3365.28 --> 3367.92
after that

3369.28 --> 3378.3190000000004
that's right slow mo moon buggy they do

3376.0 --> 3380.319
dude black lives matters probably

3378.319 --> 3380.88
attacked more black people than any

3380.319 --> 3385.2799999999997
other

3380.88 --> 3386.88
group percentile wise out there

3385.28 --> 3389.2000000000003
and why did they do it because they

3386.88 --> 3392.2400000000002
think oh you're not part of us so that

3389.2 --> 3392.24
means you're the enemy

3394.079 --> 3400.319
it's a terrorist organization

3397.28 --> 3404.0
very evil there's like really

3400.319 --> 3406.64

3406.64 --> 3419.839
blackmailing people and [ __ ]

3408.72 --> 3419.839

3422.06 --> 3425.15
[Music]

3435.599 --> 3447.839

well i'm sorry

3455.839 --> 3464.799
i'm very sorry to you but

3460.24 --> 3464.799
you're like 20 years too late dude

3465.52 --> 3468.559
yeah it is a politicized move that's

3467.76 --> 3472.0
what it is

3468.559 --> 3475.3590000000004
there is no black lives matters

3472.0 --> 3476.559
other than that right there might be

3475.359 --> 3478.88
people that are like yeah

3476.559 --> 3481.76
i i want to help black people in their

3478.88 --> 3481.76
innocence sure

3481.92 --> 3487.6800000000003
that's cute but

3485.119 --> 3489.839
there's a very big part out of there

3487.68 --> 3493.2
that is simply just a terrorist

3489.839 --> 3493.2
political organization

3493.28 --> 3500.799
get massive funding massive protection

3496.96 --> 3503.119
legal insane totally crazy they get

3500.799 --> 3507.44
media coverage

3503.119 --> 3507.44
it's a communist terrorist organization

3511.04 --> 3517.52
oh bbk dave

3514.4 --> 3520.2400000000002
up there it's hilarious you

3517.52 --> 3522.88
you this is a very easy trap to fall for

3520.24 --> 3526.0789999999997
but you're actually wrong bbk dave

3522.88 --> 3529.359
blm is not a plan

3526.079 --> 3532.6400000000003
to exterminate the white race it's to

3529.359 --> 3537.119
exterminate the black race

3532.64 --> 3537.1189999999997
oh you didn't realize that

3538.48 --> 3545.52
who's caused more like

3541.76 --> 3548.96
black deaths and racist

3545.52 --> 3551.839
hatred from blacks and towards blacks

3548.96 --> 3554.16
then black lives matter in the last few

3551.839 --> 3554.16
years

3554.72 --> 3558.24
yeah yeah sure they encourage you to

3557.839 --> 3560.5589999999997
them

3558.24 --> 3561.9199999999996
to attack white people and [ __ ]

3560.559 --> 3566.799
absolutely

3561.92 --> 3569.2000000000003
it's terrible but

3566.799 --> 3571.599
yeah they're actually they are satanic

3569.2 --> 3576.16
they're a communist organization

3571.599 --> 3579.6800000000003
a communist organization always

3576.16 --> 3584.0
attacks the thing that they

3579.68 --> 3587.2799999999997
say they champion that's the formula

3584.0 --> 3590.16
it always has been

3587.28 --> 3590.88
they're not after white people that's

3590.16 --> 3592.48
the cover

3590.88 --> 3595.28
that's what they want you to believe no

3592.48 --> 3598.4
they're actually after black people

3595.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
they're there to eradicate them

3598.4 --> 3602.96
do you understand and it's very likely

3601.839 --> 3605.44
that most of

3602.96 --> 3608.7200000000003
even the ones that are very evil they

3605.44 --> 3608.7200000000003
don't even realize that

3608.799 --> 3612.64
people at the top oh yeah they know oh

3612.16 --> 3615.839
yes

3612.64 --> 3615.839
they do

3640.839 --> 3643.839
um

3647.839 --> 3656.48
all right now but you see aratasa

3651.359 --> 3659.68
here is the thing what you say people to

3656.48 --> 3663.599
bomb it and come in with the military

3659.68 --> 3664.5589999999997
oh really so when exactly did that

3663.599 --> 3670.0
happen

3664.559 --> 3673.599
in 2020 when they did

3670.0 --> 3675.839
20 billion dollars worth of property

3673.599 --> 3678.7200000000003
damage in the united states

3675.839 --> 3680.5589999999997
did the military come in and stop them

3678.72 --> 3684.8799999999997
did they

3680.559 --> 3687.44
they didn't hmm

3684.88 --> 3689.119
well that makes your entire theory

3687.44 --> 3691.52
completely wrong then

3689.119 --> 3691.52
does it

3695.119 --> 3702.2400000000002
20 billion dollars of damage

3699.68 --> 3704.5589999999997
did the military come in no no they

3702.24 --> 3704.5589999999997
didn't

3705.04 --> 3713.839
so where's that theory now

3767.2 --> 3773.52
well i think that there's more

3769.2 --> 3773.52
systematic racism than ever now

3774.88 --> 3782.7200000000003
how could that be would it be because

3779.92 --> 3784.319
it's actually being promoted did you

3782.72 --> 3785.2
know that in the united states they're

3784.319 --> 3789.0389999999998
now

3785.2 --> 3796.72
standardizing critical race theory

3789.039 --> 3800.2400000000002
which is the most anti-black racist

3796.72 --> 3802.319
teaching the way of thinking

3800.24 --> 3803.359
that's probably have has ever been

3802.319 --> 3806.88
conceived

3803.359 --> 3810.88
so if there was no systematic racism

3806.88 --> 3811.2000000000003
there was no need for them uh yeah well

3810.88 --> 3813.92
they

3811.2 --> 3816.0
are sort of having a lot of influence

3813.92 --> 3820.0
right there in the united states and

3816.0 --> 3822.079
they just standardized

3820.0 --> 3824.0
partially like it's not like black lives

3822.079 --> 3825.8390000000004
matter is actually resisting this

3824.0 --> 3827.039
right no they're actually promoting it

3825.839 --> 3830.0789999999997
they're introducing the

3827.039 --> 3833.6800000000003
most anti-black racist

3830.079 --> 3837.52
teaching in school

3833.68 --> 3842.24
ever like

3837.52 --> 3842.24
this [ __ ] is like in ways

3844.4 --> 3849.28
it's getting kind of closer to like nazi

3847.28 --> 3852.88
germany style

3849.28 --> 3853.52
right anti-black and black lives matter

3852.88 --> 3857.839
is oh

3853.52 --> 3860.96
yay yeah because they are anti-black

3857.839 --> 3863.599
you understand this is not some joke

3860.96 --> 3867.76
this is not a conspiracy theory

3863.599 --> 3873.2000000000003
this is practical empirical

3867.76 --> 3873.2000000000003
by their actions you know them

3873.599 --> 3878.1600000000003
well right now in the united states

3875.44 --> 3881.28
critical race theory is being introduced

3878.16 --> 3883.44
and black lives matter is applauding it

3881.28 --> 3885.28
radical race theory is the most

3883.44 --> 3889.76
anti-black racist

3885.28 --> 3892.799
teachings that have ever been found

3889.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
in in american schools in his in their

3892.799 --> 3895.839
history okay

3897.039 --> 3901.119
no i know you know hitler was never

3900.0 --> 3904.24
anti-black i agree

3901.119 --> 3908.0
i agree though some

3904.24 --> 3910.3999999999996
were but that was never really an issue

3908.0 --> 3911.4
there i know it's just a comparison as

3910.4 --> 3914.4
to like

3911.4 --> 3919.119
segregation in this case

3914.4 --> 3919.119
yeah in the jews back then

3919.359 --> 3926.16
yes it's just a comparison not saying

3922.64 --> 3927.839
germany nazi germany was anti-black

3926.16 --> 3929.52
they didn't really have that much

3927.839 --> 3932.64
respect for them

3929.52 --> 3937.839
it all the it's complicated

3932.64 --> 3937.839
it's complicated

3942.0 --> 3946.48
yes renee link right

3946.88 --> 3954.319
so yeah i i stand by my case

3951.2 --> 3957.68
blm is a terrorist

3954.319 --> 3961.359
organization and they are

3957.68 --> 3964.0
communist satanic to the core

3961.359 --> 3965.2799999999997
they are there to destroy that which

3964.0 --> 3969.28
they claim

3965.28 --> 3972.6400000000003
they champion that's what

3969.28 --> 3972.6400000000003
that is that's what they do

3973.52 --> 3979.119
that's how you know it's a communist

3975.599 --> 3982.1600000000003
satanic thing

3979.119 --> 3984.4
they always do exactly the opposite of

3982.16 --> 3987.839
everything they claim

3984.4 --> 3987.839
true marxist that's right

3989.76 --> 3994.7990000000004
maybe it's better to call it marxist but

3992.559 --> 3998.799
the satanic element is very

3994.799 --> 4001.92
important to mention that right

3998.799 --> 4003.359
because it is exactly the opposite of

4001.92 --> 4005.839
what they claim they do

4003.359 --> 4006.5989999999997
that's what makes it satanic because

4005.839 --> 4010.0789999999997
they lie

4006.599 --> 4010.079
180 degrees

4014.96 --> 4021.52
it's an anti-organization

4018.559 --> 4023.119
that's advertising itself as a pro

4021.52 --> 4026.4
organizing

4023.119 --> 4029.119
that makes it satanic

4026.4 --> 4030.48
specifically it's what i call satanic

4029.119 --> 4035.599
right as in satan

4030.48 --> 4040.72
lies god truth

4035.599 --> 4040.7200000000003
so in that order of thinking satanic

4044.0 --> 4049.839
marxism really points at the methods

4046.799 --> 4049.839
they apply

4055.44 --> 4059.039
as in the left it is working

4060.559 --> 4063.8390000000004
you're talking about

4088.839 --> 4091.839
hmm

4125.92 --> 4133.6
h maybe it is what you are saying

4128.96 --> 4136.719
no i don't think so

4133.6 --> 4141.04
oh this is just it is what it is

4136.719 --> 4141.04
this is my opinion i can back it up

4141.12 --> 4148.159
theory is very clear anybody can

4145.04 --> 4151.359
test what i said based on

4148.159 --> 4151.3589999999995
just things that have happened

4151.759 --> 4158.88
right black life matters did

4155.199 --> 4160.719
absolutely organize giant destructive

4158.88 --> 4164.2390000000005
riots

4160.719 --> 4168.4
his outrage riots last year

4164.239 --> 4172.239
in america did a record amount of damage

4168.4 --> 4176.08
like unprecedented amount of damage

4172.239 --> 4178.159
think about just towns multiple towns

4176.08 --> 4181.839
completely burned down and [ __ ]

4178.159 --> 4182.239
horrific deaths i don't even know how

4181.839 --> 4185.04
many

4182.239 --> 4186.159
but just the damage alone right is

4185.04 --> 4189.6
insane

4186.159 --> 4193.04
and nobody did anything about it

4189.6 --> 4195.679
they literally poured

4193.04 --> 4197.76
piles of bricks on the side of the road

4195.679 --> 4203.4400000000005
before it happened

4197.76 --> 4207.280000000001
nobody stopped them no military

4203.44 --> 4209.28
the police if they were even there

4207.28 --> 4211.84
they weren't really doing anything to

4209.28 --> 4211.84
stop them

4214.84 --> 4217.84
right

4219.679 --> 4224.96
so that makes absolutely no sense and

4222.0 --> 4228.48
anybody that would say oh

4224.96 --> 4229.199
they are just there to trigger martial

4228.48 --> 4232.48
law

4229.199 --> 4233.5199999999995
oh really well where where did that

4232.48 --> 4237.678999999999
happen exactly

4233.52 --> 4240.159000000001
last year then no it didn't

4237.679 --> 4240.8
nothing happened they just let them

4240.159 --> 4244.639999999999
trash

4240.8 --> 4248.08
everything peep

4244.64 --> 4252.08
even called it non-violent protesters

4248.08 --> 4255.199
right as as [ __ ] entire buildings were

4252.08 --> 4257.36
literally burning down on camera

4255.199 --> 4261.5199999999995
behind the reporters and they were

4257.36 --> 4261.5199999999995
calling it non-violent protesters

4268.48 --> 4275.759999999999
right and now south africa is getting it

4272.159 --> 4275.759999999999
it feels very similar

4276.08 --> 4280.719
just riled up outraged mobs

4283.04 --> 4287.84
it's it's [ __ ]

4296.0 --> 4299.76
40 damage is not violence are you

4299.04 --> 4302.4
kidding me

4299.76 --> 4302.400000000001
leopold

4312.88 --> 4317.84
okay well there's sure as hell did a lot

4316.0 --> 4321.199
of people get killed as well

4317.84 --> 4323.84
right on record

4321.199 --> 4325.36
like literally just beaten to death on

4323.84 --> 4330.56
the streets

4325.36 --> 4330.5599999999995
yeah how's that for non-violent

4331.28 --> 4337.36
or or did you need to defend

4334.32 --> 4340.639999999999
this some more is this your next

4337.36 --> 4344.44
level globe you can't handle it

4340.64 --> 4350.0
that this satanic lying

4344.44 --> 4353.678999999999
anti-black terrorist organization

4350.0 --> 4355.679
you don't like that to face what it is

4353.679 --> 4358.2390000000005
and what it does

4355.679 --> 4360.32
so you have to find your way through

4358.239 --> 4363.36
it's like oh no that's not

4360.32 --> 4365.599999999999
violence that's not violence

4363.36 --> 4367.839999999999
oh yeah really really well people got

4365.6 --> 4371.04
literally just

4367.84 --> 4374.4800000000005
bashed to death with bricks

4371.04 --> 4378.48
and the side of the road yeah violence

4374.48 --> 4383.759999999999
[ __ ] yeah violence yeah that's right

4378.48 --> 4387.919999999999
thanks it's amazing that it wasn't more

4383.76 --> 4392.64
but yeah yeah people got killed

4387.92 --> 4392.64
from violent assaults of the mobs

4392.96 --> 4399.84
yeah they did

4410.84 --> 4413.84
so

4423.36 --> 4428.32
i appreciate that renee link yes i know

4425.92 --> 4428.32
i am

4429.36 --> 4443.839999999999
very sure about my case in this

4441.84 --> 4446.32
yeah seeking stuff but seeking stuff you

4443.84 --> 4449.6
are right it's just that

4446.32 --> 4453.599999999999
i'm after everything i've said

4449.6 --> 4456.64
about this i'm like really disgusted

4453.6 --> 4459.76
to be honest that they would still

4456.64 --> 4463.84
even attempt

4459.76 --> 4467.1990000000005
to nitpick it out of

4463.84 --> 4470.64
the darkness that it is that's

4467.199 --> 4473.839999999999
really repulsive that's

4470.64 --> 4478.64
cult that's the sign

4473.84 --> 4481.92
that you refuse to believe the facts

4478.64 --> 4483.84
that you are engaging in making up

4481.92 --> 4486.4
excuses

4483.84 --> 4489.52
probably from a process not too far off

4486.4 --> 4489.5199999999995
stockholm syndrome

4494.32 --> 4502.08
plm is a violent

4498.76 --> 4511.84
anti-black racist

4502.08 --> 4511.84
marxist terrorist organization

4526.719 --> 4531.28
right dude you want to be like pro black

4532.96 --> 4538.4
no try to find like the old black

4536.64 --> 4541.92
panther crowd

4538.4 --> 4544.08
not the new [ __ ] it's all garbage

4541.92 --> 4545.84
it's kind of blemish i don't know i

4544.08 --> 4548.159
don't know enough about it

4545.84 --> 4549.28
but i know that the old style black

4548.159 --> 4551.92
panthers

4549.28 --> 4553.5199999999995
because it's been an item some of them

4551.92 --> 4556.56
come on the alex jones so

4553.52 --> 4560.4800000000005
really fascinating people like they are

4556.56 --> 4560.4800000000005
actually pro black right

4561.92 --> 4566.32
so if you want to be pro black find

4564.56 --> 4570.56
people that are actually

4566.32 --> 4574.08
pro-black and expect a lot of resistance

4570.56 --> 4577.280000000001
because the society is becoming satanic

4574.08 --> 4577.28
if you don't support

4577.44 --> 4581.28
the groups that are satanic and

4579.36 --> 4583.92
obviously inverted

4581.28 --> 4585.36
then you will get criticized for

4583.92 --> 4587.92
supposedly being

4585.36 --> 4589.5199999999995
anti-black in this case with blm right

4587.92 --> 4592.32
that's what people will do as part of

4589.52 --> 4595.6
the satanic reverse world spell

4592.32 --> 4600.239
a real defense of a group will

4595.6 --> 4602.64
meet resistance you got to realize that

4600.239 --> 4603.36
if you want to be pro-black find people

4602.64 --> 4606.56
that are

4603.36 --> 4609.36
actually pro-black

4606.56 --> 4609.84
and that are effective at it that don't

4609.36 --> 4612.48
just

4609.84 --> 4613.360000000001
rall you up to hate other races or

4612.48 --> 4618.718999999999
[ __ ]

4613.36 --> 4622.08
no actually help you advise you to

4618.719 --> 4624.8
be cool to do the right thing to

4622.08 --> 4626.32
have a family to teach your kids don't

4624.8 --> 4628.4800000000005
abandon them and

4626.32 --> 4629.759999999999
don't get seduced by the system don't

4628.48 --> 4632.48
become dependent on

4629.76 --> 4633.12
all that right the right teachings that

4632.48 --> 4636.32
by the way

4633.12 --> 4639.84
apply to everybody not just blacks

4636.32 --> 4640.48
right find the right group the right

4639.84 --> 4644.08
crowd

4640.48 --> 4651.839999999999
that is actually pro black get away

4644.08 --> 4651.84
from the satanic freaks

4660.159 --> 4666.96
you're pro-justice oh really pro-justice

4663.92 --> 4666.96
justice for what

4672.88 --> 4677.6
you think it's pro-justice to program

4675.44 --> 4681.04
every black person

4677.6 --> 4684.320000000001
from from a very young age on

4681.04 --> 4687.36
that you don't have a chance in this

4684.32 --> 4690.0
world because you're black

4687.36 --> 4692.48
how is that pro-justice how is it

4690.0 --> 4694.64
pro-justice that people that

4692.48 --> 4695.599999999999
worked hard all their lives that have a

4694.64 --> 4699.12
shop have a

4695.6 --> 4699.6
mall maybe and it all just gets burned

4699.12 --> 4702.239
down

4699.6 --> 4703.04
just like that because they happen to be

4702.239 --> 4705.678999999999
white

4703.04 --> 4707.6
and hey sometimes they were just black

4705.679 --> 4707.92
and they were just black and were like

4707.6 --> 4709.84
yeah

4707.92 --> 4711.6
[ __ ] black lives matter you people are

4709.84 --> 4714.2390000000005
crazy communists

4711.6 --> 4714.96
then they burn their stores down to how

4714.239 --> 4719.12
is that

4714.96 --> 4721.84
justice yeah how is that justice

4719.12 --> 4721.84
you tell me

4734.8 --> 4737.92
that's right renee link i seem to be

4736.64 --> 4749.84
very well informed

4737.92 --> 4749.84
scott that's awesome

4758.08 --> 4768.32
oh so you're gonna ignore everything

4763.199 --> 4768.32
only truth and justice but

4768.719 --> 4771.84
i'm giving you advice on how to actually

4771.04 --> 4774.159
achieve that

4771.84 --> 4777.84
but you're still unwilling to actually

4774.159 --> 4777.839999999999
accept that blm is a

4778.64 --> 4785.4400000000005
i don't even want to keep saying or

4781.679 --> 4790.2390000000005
you know what i mean come on

4785.44 --> 4794.159
seriously let it go

4790.239 --> 4797.12
disconnect they're satanic

4794.159 --> 4798.5599999999995
hey you turn everything inside out and

4797.12 --> 4801.92
spellbound you

4798.56 --> 4805.6
for that step out

4801.92 --> 4808.8
disconnect it hurts you've been fooled

4805.6 --> 4810.96
the longer you stay believing that they

4808.8 --> 4813.92
are

4810.96 --> 4815.92
what they actually say they are the

4813.92 --> 4819.679
worse the pain is gonna get

4815.92 --> 4833.84
let it go you're being spellbound

4819.679 --> 4833.84
let it go arataza rather

4834.83 --> 4838.5289999999995
[Music]

4841.53 --> 4844.62
[Music]

4858.719 --> 4863.28
now you're just rambling that's [ __ ]

4865.84 --> 4872.0
hello arthur lewton luther king

4869.04 --> 4872.719
and the black panther movement they were

4872.0 --> 4874.32
connected

4872.719 --> 4876.4
what the hell are you blabbering about

4874.32 --> 4879.28
they didn't have any effect

4876.4 --> 4881.36
but martha luther king did the black

4879.28 --> 4884.88
panther movement haven't

4881.36 --> 4886.159
sprouted up probably would have never

4884.88 --> 4889.12
even happened

4886.159 --> 4891.199
i don't i'm not the specialist in the

4889.12 --> 4893.199
historical details of what exactly

4891.199 --> 4894.96
happened to actually make a claim like

4893.199 --> 4897.28
that

4894.96 --> 4899.199
but i'm pretty sure that they were

4897.28 --> 4901.92
involved every time i hear about martin

4899.199 --> 4903.759999999999
luther king and it's like a documentary

4901.92 --> 4904.719
or whatever it's always black panthers

4903.76 --> 4906.4800000000005
are also there

4904.719 --> 4909.679
because i'm pretty sure they were

4906.48 --> 4909.678999999999
intricately connected

4910.4 --> 4914.4
like a grassroot action movement and

4913.199 --> 4918.0
more like the legal

4914.4 --> 4921.36
movement right something like that

4918.0 --> 4923.76
i'm being sloppy so

4921.36 --> 4924.5599999999995
but you're being weird man arathaza

4923.76 --> 4930.0
you're being

4924.56 --> 4932.639
very very weird about this

4930.0 --> 4933.76
like this you're not getting my respect

4932.639 --> 4936.400000000001
over doing this

4933.76 --> 4936.96
at all and this is not the first time

4936.4 --> 4939.44
you've

4936.96 --> 4941.679
brought forward just hanging on to bad

4939.44 --> 4945.839999999999
things for bad reasons

4941.679 --> 4945.84
it's not healthy man let it go

4946.56 --> 4949.4400000000005
i insist

4956.159 --> 4961.199
now thank you renee link i thought i was

4958.96 --> 4973.84
right about that

4961.199 --> 4973.839999999999
thanks for confirming

4979.679 --> 4987.84
see me

4990.159 --> 5001.839999999999
still go [ __ ]

5003.679 --> 5007.52
oh agm that's [ __ ]

5007.84 --> 5017.6
we do have color

5014.48 --> 5021.199
absolutely because it matters

5017.6 --> 5021.52
like not like literally the color and

5021.199 --> 5023.678999999999
then

5021.52 --> 5025.84
exclude everything else no no no it's

5023.679 --> 5025.84
just

5027.28 --> 5031.04
the impulses on the inside and

5032.88 --> 5037.36
social feeling strength and compassion

5035.52 --> 5038.88
all kinds of things yeah yeah color

5037.36 --> 5042.5599999999995
absolutely matters for

5038.88 --> 5044.400000000001
how you are it does

5042.56 --> 5045.92
we are not just gonna say oh color

5044.4 --> 5047.839999999999
doesn't exist anymore no no

5045.92 --> 5049.1990000000005
there's another group that likes to do

5047.84 --> 5052.32
that

5049.199 --> 5055.919999999999
communist no

5052.32 --> 5059.04
we are different that doesn't mean that

5055.92 --> 5062.08
we cannot get along and that we cannot

5059.04 --> 5066.0
just support everybody

5062.08 --> 5068.88
to crush it to do well right

5066.0 --> 5070.8
both do well then we could only learn

5068.88 --> 5073.1990000000005
from our differences

5070.8 --> 5075.84
instead of attacking another over the

5073.199 --> 5075.839999999999
differences

5075.92 --> 5078.8
that's my approach

5083.679 --> 5086.719
yeah clutch bear i'm with you on that

5085.44 --> 5089.04
one yeah

5086.719 --> 5092.159
you're not fooling anybody here out of

5089.04 --> 5092.159
taza at this allah

5096.4 --> 5100.879999999999
yeah you're taking it personal in a very

5099.199 --> 5104.239
stupid way

5100.88 --> 5105.4400000000005
in a way that you're not really

5104.239 --> 5107.36
listening anymore

5105.44 --> 5109.44
so you must be triggered because you're

5107.36 --> 5112.5599999999995
not listening anymore and you're just

5109.44 --> 5116.0
spouting typical indoctrination

5112.56 --> 5118.4800000000005
rhetoric based thinking instead of

5116.0 --> 5122.159
addressing everything i've said about it

5118.48 --> 5125.599999999999
like highlighting the mechanics

5122.159 --> 5128.5599999999995
of what it is and does right

5125.6 --> 5128.56
you're not listening

5130.639 --> 5141.84
getting a little bit annoying

5188.719 --> 5193.12
okay thanks for that

5194.4 --> 5197.839999999999
okay to be vague there

5205.04 --> 5210.159
i we're not really talking about that

5207.36 --> 5213.199
right now

5210.159 --> 5216.159
talking about classism and industrial

5213.199 --> 5218.5599999999995
control sure that's taking place i it's

5216.159 --> 5225.599999999999
not really in the conversation right now

5218.56 --> 5229.6
a bit of a red herring away

5225.6 --> 5229.6
but yeah at first glance i can't

5236.84 --> 5239.84
disagree

5249.76 --> 5253.92
truth hurts especially if you're locked

5253.52 --> 5258.88
into

5253.92 --> 5258.88
a reversed world reality

5261.199 --> 5265.04
then it actually really hurts because

5263.52 --> 5268.639
then

5265.04 --> 5269.76
it is forwarded it is inserted towards

5268.639 --> 5273.28
you

5269.76 --> 5274.2390000000005
by habit by systematic nature of the

5273.28 --> 5278.639
reversed world

5274.239 --> 5281.919999999999
way of doing things as the ultimate lie

5278.639 --> 5284.08
so yeah that makes it very hard

5281.92 --> 5285.679
to actually realize when something is

5284.08 --> 5288.96
true and most will

5285.679 --> 5290.32
avoid it while being in that reversed

5288.96 --> 5292.88
world

5290.32 --> 5293.44
which i'm having a lot of suspicion

5292.88 --> 5296.56
right now

5293.44 --> 5296.5599999999995
you're stuck in it

5296.639 --> 5299.84
it's not the first time but i've seen

5299.52 --> 5302.88
you

5299.84 --> 5305.28
say really odd things

5302.88 --> 5307.1990000000005
that i'm now directly suspecting that

5305.28 --> 5311.36
you are

5307.199 --> 5311.36
mind controlled in a really bad way

5315.12 --> 5319.36
i think you might be hanging around have

5318.08 --> 5324.48
been hanging around with some

5319.36 --> 5324.48
really really terrible influencing

5334.84 --> 5337.84
people

5342.4 --> 5351.36
sorry 26 was immigration good for

5345.6 --> 5354.719
english soccer team

5351.36 --> 5354.719
i'm gonna do that are we

5355.76 --> 5359.679
yeah yeah that trolling's not gonna end

5357.6 --> 5362.8
for a while

5359.679 --> 5367.679
and well to be fair they totally deserve

5362.8 --> 5367.679
every bit of it it was all stupid

5376.159 --> 5383.679
right but i'll just keep it to look

5380.0 --> 5386.239
european soccer finals italian stole

5383.679 --> 5393.84
their bike back

5386.239 --> 5393.839999999999
more needs not be said

5411.199 --> 5414.32
uh hey jim you didn't hear that haven't

5412.96 --> 5416.4
you heard that before i've been saying

5414.32 --> 5420.239
that for like

5416.4 --> 5423.839999999999
since the finals

5420.239 --> 5427.839999999999
i'm really surprised that

5423.84 --> 5429.4400000000005
alex j alex jones yeah like he would say

5427.84 --> 5432.2390000000005
that

5429.44 --> 5434.0
my god can you imagine that no i thought

5432.239 --> 5435.44
it was owen benjamin was gonna make a

5434.0 --> 5436.159
joke about it at some point but he

5435.44 --> 5440.08
hasn't

5436.159 --> 5440.08
kind of ignored it

5443.52 --> 5449.84
or maybe i missed that part

5453.44 --> 5457.839999999999
all right hm yeah i thought it was funny

5458.32 --> 5461.759999999999
but what home management did talk about

5460.96 --> 5463.679
that

5461.76 --> 5465.84
what's really hilarious was on that show

5463.679 --> 5465.84
from

5466.719 --> 5470.96
tuesday i think that apparently yeah

5469.679 --> 5475.28
that

5470.96 --> 5479.36
a lot of races tweets and blah blah

5475.28 --> 5482.4
facebook posts towards these

5479.36 --> 5485.5199999999995
yeah the black players

5482.4 --> 5491.04
of the british team which

5485.52 --> 5493.040000000001
yeah also happen to basically ruin the

5491.04 --> 5494.8
yeah the game at the end right they

5493.04 --> 5496.56
might have been great as players

5494.8 --> 5499.4400000000005
during the actual football game with but

5496.56 --> 5501.4400000000005
with the penalties they screwed up

5499.44 --> 5503.04
they got a lot of racist tweets and then

5501.44 --> 5504.4
i heard

5503.04 --> 5506.8
benjamin that apparently like the

5504.4 --> 5508.5599999999995
government's like oh stop being racist

5506.8 --> 5509.92
against these black players but then

5508.56 --> 5512.56
tracing back

5509.92 --> 5514.8
where these messages are coming from

5512.56 --> 5518.0
it's like five percent

5514.8 --> 5523.1990000000005
england and the 95 is all

5518.0 --> 5523.199
coming from china and saudi arabia

5523.36 --> 5530.799999999999
so he did talk about that

5526.96 --> 5533.44
because yeah china saudi arabia they

5530.8 --> 5536.8
don't give a [ __ ]

5533.44 --> 5541.678999999999
they're like [ __ ] you we can make racist

5536.8 --> 5541.679
jokes because we can what are you gonna

5544.84 --> 5547.84
do

5551.84 --> 5561.84
so yeah i did hear about that

5570.0 --> 5577.52
no garbage

5574.719 --> 5577.52
or cabbage

5582.88 --> 5589.04
what about the other races

5585.92 --> 5590.639
well first off into hd race is actually

5589.04 --> 5593.84
a social construct

5590.639 --> 5596.159000000001
it doesn't technically exist

5593.84 --> 5596.96
it would be more legitimate to actually

5596.159 --> 5600.638999999999
designate

5596.96 --> 5604.08
people's in tribes

5600.639 --> 5607.04
like where what's the original region

5604.08 --> 5607.04
where they came from

5608.159 --> 5616.32
it because race is really more just

5611.92 --> 5619.52
how it's identified determined

5616.32 --> 5622.88
is rather through looks and over

5619.52 --> 5622.88
generalized category

5624.0 --> 5629.6
it's kind of arbitrary just go by the

5627.12 --> 5633.679
tribe like what is your original tribe

5629.6 --> 5633.679
where did your ancestors live

5633.92 --> 5638.639
that'll tell you a whole lot more about

5636.56 --> 5640.2390000000005
what you're like

5638.639 --> 5642.2390000000005
if you have any knowledge about that

5640.239 --> 5645.599999999999
whatsoever

5642.239 --> 5659.839999999999
much more valid data

5645.6 --> 5659.84
in my opinion

5665.84 --> 5672.56
well yes vkk dave but effectively by

5669.28 --> 5675.759999999999
what i just described about it about

5672.56 --> 5680.080000000001
racism versus tribes

5675.76 --> 5682.56
racism was there to unravel tribes

5680.08 --> 5683.6
to over generalize to make people think

5682.56 --> 5685.52
that a race

5683.6 --> 5687.280000000001
is more important than their tribe

5685.52 --> 5691.280000000001
origin to

5687.28 --> 5695.04
make it forget about them get it

5691.28 --> 5698.08
but let it all blend into the soup

5695.04 --> 5700.159
the modernized programming

5698.08 --> 5702.96
forget about your tribe when tribe

5700.159 --> 5708.0
knowledge can be extremely important

5702.96 --> 5710.96
and extensive

5708.0 --> 5713.6
ancient tribal knowledge is like can be

5710.96 --> 5717.119
a whole world of knowledge on its own

5713.6 --> 5721.1990000000005
right and they they pushed

5717.119 --> 5724.239
society to make you forget about that

5721.199 --> 5726.638999999999
let it go and just be categorized in

5724.239 --> 5728.159
a race that's what it was there for

5726.639 --> 5732.32
that's why they invented it

5728.159 --> 5734.48
to destroy tribe roots

5732.32 --> 5735.36
that's what it was invented for to

5734.48 --> 5738.5599999999995
destroy

5735.36 --> 5741.28
tribe roots that's what racism and the

5738.56 --> 5745.04
concept the social construct of race

5741.28 --> 5747.92
was invented for specifically

5745.04 --> 5748.4
part of marxism all about destroying the

5747.92 --> 5751.679
roots

5748.4 --> 5752.879999999999
undigging it's all satanic everything is

5751.679 --> 5757.84
there to destroy

5752.88 --> 5757.84
what is valuable

5758.159 --> 5761.5199999999995
race with ethnicity

5762.4 --> 5771.839999999999
uh okay it could be

5766.8 --> 5771.84
wait what's the difference

5773.119 --> 5777.28
expecting that

5778.32 --> 5785.84
what is the difference

5796.0 --> 5802.4
right ethnicity is more about cultural

5798.48 --> 5802.4
expressions and identification

5805.199 --> 5810.839999999999
race about biology right

5808.48 --> 5812.48
well what i'm doing is is the

5810.84 --> 5816.400000000001
highlighting

5812.48 --> 5819.239
how well ethnicity knowledge

5816.4 --> 5820.638999999999
is very much more likely to be lost or

5819.239 --> 5826.159
misinterpreted

5820.639 --> 5828.639
based on racial programming

5826.159 --> 5830.08
right that would have never happened

5828.639 --> 5831.92
then there would have been a whole bunch

5830.08 --> 5834.08
of people having a whole

5831.92 --> 5835.36
extensive background knowledge because

5834.08 --> 5837.36
that would be the norm

5835.36 --> 5839.199
it's like oh tell me about your family

5837.36 --> 5842.239
history right

5839.199 --> 5845.839999999999
100 years ago that was

5842.239 --> 5846.5599999999995
normal everybody knew their family

5845.84 --> 5849.6
history

5846.56 --> 5853.1990000000005
and their family traits and abilities

5849.6 --> 5856.4800000000005
and unique family traits and all that

5853.199 --> 5860.48
yeah that is all

5856.48 --> 5864.159
watered down thanks to race

5860.48 --> 5864.159
theology an idea

5865.679 --> 5869.04
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

5867.679 --> 5870.639
it's turning out to be a very

5869.04 --> 5873.84
interesting show

5870.639 --> 5873.84
very controversial

5877.6 --> 5881.280000000001
and yeah again the title has actually

5880.08 --> 5883.6
been made to be

5881.28 --> 5885.679
relevant throughout the entire hangout

5883.6 --> 5888.719
isn't that interesting

5885.679 --> 5889.52
