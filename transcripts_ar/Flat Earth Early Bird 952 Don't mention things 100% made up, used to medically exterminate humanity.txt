bit of clouds lots of sun

109.68 --> 115.84
very warm out there

124.88 --> 131.44

155.04 --> 159.35999999999999
hour and 40 minutes

156.64 --> 161.599
ahead sorry for starting a little late i

159.36 --> 161.59900000000002
just

162.08 --> 165.639
[Music]

167.519 --> 172.959
i tried to start in time but didn't

169.68 --> 172.959
really work out

175.76 --> 180.959
because oh world terror306 dude those

178.879 --> 185.84
dislikes are there even before

180.959 --> 185.84
literally before the show goes live

189.12 --> 193.84
so welcome to chat also

195.36 --> 201.92000000000002
right so yeah i'm not in the best of

198.959 --> 201.92000000000002
boots today

203.68 --> 209.68
for various reasons but at least there's

205.84 --> 209.68
plenty of things that happen to talk

210.84 --> 216.4
about

212.879 --> 216.39999999999998
yeah yeah i saw that live

217.28 --> 223.44
and yeah it's a bunch of

220.319 --> 225.83999999999997
nice smiley ladies

223.44 --> 228.239
just talking oh they're going to space

225.84 --> 233.28
and other in space and oh

228.239 --> 235.799
right oh the last rocket boost

233.28 --> 238.799
so now they're unbuckling and they're

235.799 --> 238.799
experiencing

238.959 --> 245.439
zero gravity let's not

242.4 --> 246.31900000000002
show that though let's not actually show

245.439 --> 249.68
that no no

246.319 --> 254.159
they're supposedly doing that

249.68 --> 257.28000000000003
let's not actually show that life

254.159 --> 258.4
right let's just say they did that and

257.28 --> 261.28
then much later

258.4 --> 262.4
when obviously they are in descent

261.28 --> 265.44
that's when you show

262.4 --> 268.15999999999997
a short like a second

265.44 --> 269.199
oh look oh look they're floating yeah

268.16 --> 272.40000000000003
yeah no [ __ ]

269.199 --> 273.759
cause they're descending right that

272.4 --> 275.75899999999996
doesn't happen

273.759 --> 277.44
as they're still going up there with the

275.759 --> 278.40000000000003
last rocket boost that's not when

277.44 --> 281.36
weightlessness

278.4 --> 282.96
apparent weightlessness starts starts in

281.36 --> 286.16
the descent

282.96 --> 289.28
they didn't say that though they said as

286.16 --> 291.68
soon as the last rocket boost

289.28 --> 292.79999999999995
upwards that's when they unbuckle

291.68 --> 296.0
because they experience

292.8 --> 298.639
zero g but we're not going to actually

296.0 --> 299.68
show you that we're just gonna say they

298.639 --> 305.6
did that

299.68 --> 305.6
right yeah i saw it live

307.039 --> 311.919
i told everybody that they were gonna do

309.919 --> 312.79999999999995
that and then as it was supposedly

311.919 --> 315.59999999999997
happening

312.8 --> 318.0
say that they're doing it not actually

315.6 --> 318.0
show it

319.759 --> 327.36
yeah so i did see it

323.44 --> 327.36
and that immediately stood out to me

332.72 --> 337.12
right so yeah also obviously

337.6 --> 341.759
the finals in football yesterday

342.639 --> 348.08
i didn't even see the the game live to

345.6 --> 348.08000000000004
be fair

348.16 --> 352.72
i was distracted by other things and in

350.88 --> 355.84
retrospect

352.72 --> 355.84000000000003
i think that would have been

359.759 --> 363.6
yeah the game just ended terribly

365.6 --> 372.24
it was kind of funny because uh vox day

368.96 --> 373.59999999999997
did a a bit of a live stream not too

372.24 --> 375.12
long after

373.6 --> 377.52000000000004
talking about football because

375.12 --> 380.88
apparently he is into football a lot

377.52 --> 384.96
still practices it

380.88 --> 387.039
age of 50. so he had a lot to say about

384.96 --> 387.039
it

392.0 --> 395.52
the only thing that i have to say about

394.24 --> 397.6
it

395.52 --> 399.12
i wonder if it's going to echo on

397.6 --> 400.8
because it's a joke that

399.12 --> 402.24
like a lot of people probably want to

400.8 --> 406.319
make is that

402.24 --> 410.479
yeah that italian keeper basically

406.319 --> 413.84000000000003
caused the italy to want to win yeah

410.479 --> 413.84
stole the bikes back

415.199 --> 423.84000000000003
bears here that are gonna hear this know

417.199 --> 423.84000000000003
what i mean

428.88 --> 437.36
hello hmm yeah seven

432.72 --> 440.8
stone monkey 3d kristen

437.36 --> 442.47900000000004
right also apparently i couldn't i got a

440.8 --> 445.52000000000004
guideline strike

442.479 --> 447.199
like after two days or

445.52 --> 448.56
what i thought was a pretty brilliant

447.199 --> 450.88
title

448.56 --> 452.479
show i didn't even i don't even remember

450.88 --> 455.199
if i

452.479 --> 457.919
just apparently they couldn't handle the

455.199 --> 461.039
joke or they didn't see it they thought

457.919 --> 465.84
they didn't actually see

461.039 --> 467.919
the word up in that title

465.84 --> 470.31899999999996
so they thought i was some kind of a

467.919 --> 472.639
standard

470.319 --> 474.0
other side narrative or something and

472.639 --> 477.599
that to of course

474.0 --> 481.199
immediately remove that right out there

477.599 --> 483.039
any official opposing narrative

481.199 --> 485.44
even though that narrative is still

483.039 --> 486.479
totally bunk because it presupposes

485.44 --> 489.599
viruses exist

486.479 --> 491.36
in the first place that but they didn't

489.599 --> 492.0
see it so they thought it was necessary

491.36 --> 496.72
to strike

492.0 --> 500.0
it so yeah hence the title today

496.72 --> 502.72
and me being a little pissed off

500.0 --> 507.52
because they literally ruined my joke

502.72 --> 521.839
they didn't see it and they

507.52 --> 521.8389999999999
i'm insulted

530.0 --> 533.279
is your hero wow

533.36 --> 541.12
that's really pathetic right

537.12 --> 542.5600000000001
now besides that of course space is fake

541.12 --> 545.76
and it's total [ __ ]

542.56 --> 546.7199999999999
and it wastes the money to be honest i

545.76 --> 550.0
thought

546.72 --> 552.88
the vehicle and

550.0 --> 554.88
what it is designed to do was actually

552.88 --> 557.279
pretty cool

554.88 --> 557.279
i do

558.48 --> 564.88
that is an interesting piece

561.519 --> 568.399
in its kind of it's

564.88 --> 571.76
built for luxurious

568.399 --> 574.8
exploits which is completely pointless

571.76 --> 574.8
and a waste of money

574.839 --> 579.6800000000001
but i thought that is for what it was

577.68 --> 581.3599999999999
supposed to do it was a pretty good

579.68 --> 584.0799999999999
design

581.36 --> 584.08
right so

584.56 --> 589.76
that part i did think

587.6 --> 592.0
i think it's an interesting concept how

589.76 --> 594.959
they designed it

592.0 --> 596.88
and everything seemed to function just

594.959 --> 600.399
smoothly and perfectly

596.88 --> 602.56
for reals so but yeah of course

600.399 --> 604.72
no of course they didn't go into space

602.56 --> 608.16
and had no

604.72 --> 609.839
environment going upward still

608.16 --> 613.1999999999999
that's preposterous and that's why they

609.839 --> 617.7600000000001
didn't show it to you live of course

613.2 --> 633.839
but as it is a mechanical engineering

617.76 --> 633.8389999999999
that is was pretty interesting

635.04 --> 648.8
okay that's

646.48 --> 648.8000000000001
bye

650.8 --> 656.7199999999999
i don't need your [ __ ] bribes

653.92 --> 658.0
yeah i'm not gonna chant your [ __ ]

656.72 --> 661.76
for you

658.0 --> 665.2
for money

661.76 --> 669.2
yeah i don't

665.2 --> 675.839
chant [ __ ] for money you understand

669.2 --> 675.839
they can [ __ ] off

686.839 --> 689.839
um

693.44 --> 699.36
never sell yourself

696.48 --> 699.36
out no

700.24 --> 703.839
it's all i got

728.839 --> 731.839
um

741.44 --> 759.839
everybody can do it it's going to be

743.12 --> 759.839
expensive as [ __ ] though

770.839 --> 773.839
wow

782.24 --> 787.839
hey ajm good to see you

793.63 --> 796.7
[Music]

798.959 --> 802.56
right but anyway as i was saying don't

802.16 --> 804.7199999999999
put

802.56 --> 806.6389999999999
as i was saying what is it 15 minutes

804.72 --> 810.24
ago dude

806.639 --> 814.0790000000001
hey please come back leave me alone

810.24 --> 818.639
stop whining

814.079 --> 818.6389999999999
can you guys uh assist me again

826.079 --> 831.8389999999999
don't hide it just ban him just

829.199 --> 831.8389999999999
straight up

832.32 --> 835.519
now need to timeout just straight out

834.56 --> 837.4399999999999
venom

835.519 --> 839.92
but it's a great likelihood i'll be

837.44 --> 844.1600000000001
first though

839.92 --> 844.4799999999999
so but anyway so when i go into a just

844.16 --> 847.199
full

844.48 --> 849.04
rolling conversation i'm not going to be

847.199 --> 851.8389999999999
then at the same time

849.04 --> 853.5999999999999
all of the time paying attention to chat

851.839 --> 855.36
you see this [ __ ] popping up with

853.6 --> 858.399
this [ __ ]

855.36 --> 861.76
straight out ban straight out

858.399 --> 863.68
right anyway as i was saying i didn't

861.76 --> 867.279
see the english

863.68 --> 871.199
and versus italy final match

867.279 --> 874.56
because i was watching a movie

871.199 --> 877.3599999999999
very very scary movie

874.56 --> 877.3599999999999
dr sleep

880.16 --> 883.68
feel kind of lucky didn't give me

881.68 --> 885.4399999999999
nightmares but

883.68 --> 887.12
when i was watching that that whole

885.44 --> 890.24
thing just triggered

887.12 --> 893.04
so many dark world fish and [ __ ]

890.24 --> 893.04
unbelievable

896.839 --> 903.6
and dare i say

899.92 --> 903.5999999999999
it's not that far off

911.279 --> 919.519
but yeah in i'm not gonna spend like the

915.04 --> 919.519
an entire show explaining exactly why

922.72 --> 927.839
but i will tell people private

932.56 --> 937.3599999999999
because anyway if you haven't seen that

936.639 --> 939.36
movie

937.36 --> 941.839
make sure not to watch it right before

939.36 --> 941.839
going to bed

943.44 --> 955.839
because it is really freaking scary

962.72 --> 966.88
yes he will i demand it

967.6 --> 973.0400000000001
right how else will i know if i'm on the

970.88 --> 977.36
wrong track or on the right track

973.04 --> 977.36
as people blabber all over the place

977.6 --> 982.72
they're opinionated they're politicized

980.56 --> 984.16
they're absolutely unclear in their

982.72 --> 986.32
judgment because

984.16 --> 987.519
they lose that clarity as soon as they

986.32 --> 989.44
get triggered over some

987.519 --> 992.16
personal little stupid mistake and then

989.44 --> 995.36
they lose all their sensibility

992.16 --> 997.519
and body a demonic spirit

995.36 --> 999.04
and start just straight out at home

997.519 --> 1001.36
attacking

999.04 --> 1004.079
and falsely judging like demons

1001.36 --> 1004.0790000000001
typically do

1005.199 --> 1012.16
right but god also judges

1008.48 --> 1015.6
he judges straight out

1012.16 --> 1017.519
in life through the physical world

1015.6 --> 1019.0400000000001
reflection through how your body

1017.519 --> 1021.12
responds through

1019.04 --> 1022.399
what thoughts enter your minds what

1021.12 --> 1024.959
feelings arrive

1022.399 --> 1025.76
what you dream about yeah that's god's

1024.959 --> 1030.079
judgment

1025.76 --> 1033.52
in life and the more you're open to it

1030.079 --> 1034.8799999999999
the quicker things will resolve and the

1033.52 --> 1037.28
quicker

1034.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
you will gain a grasp on what is really

1037.28 --> 1039.839
true

1040.079 --> 1048.48
so yeah god will judge me i demand it

1044.72 --> 1049.44
judge me god show me what is real and

1048.48 --> 1052.48
what is not

1049.44 --> 1056.48
what is wrong with what i think

1052.48 --> 1059.3600000000001
and say and do show me reveal it to me

1056.48 --> 1060.88
right and that's not through somebody

1059.36 --> 1066.32
else's mouth

1060.88 --> 1071.8400000000001
or through their texting

1066.32 --> 1073.76
he reveals it usually through those

1071.84 --> 1075.1999999999998
are either through direct things that

1073.76 --> 1078.64
happen or through

1075.2 --> 1081.039
those that don't know about it

1078.64 --> 1083.3600000000001
right that's what i found out a lot of

1081.039 --> 1086.64
the times you will see

1083.36 --> 1089.52
the purest of truth in those that don't

1086.64 --> 1089.5200000000002
know about it

1091.2 --> 1094.64
they will reflect honestly sometimes

1094.0 --> 1096.559
even it

1094.64 --> 1100.24
when they don't cut yeah you don't even

1096.559 --> 1103.28
have to consciously inform about them

1100.24 --> 1104.64
them about it it's fascinating right but

1103.28 --> 1109.36
what does not

1104.64 --> 1113.2
help at all is listening to opinionated

1109.36 --> 1117.12
demonically possessed scumbags

1113.2 --> 1120.8400000000001
that just want you to stop

1117.12 --> 1123.84
because they do not reflect god's

1120.84 --> 1123.84
judgment

1125.52 --> 1137.84
ah au backup 53

1140.48 --> 1147.039
right i didn't keep track of like the

1144.96 --> 1149.2
exact height and all that

1147.039 --> 1151.679
but yeah i guess that's right i don't

1149.2 --> 1155.76
think any

1151.679 --> 1155.76
vehicle has ever been beyond the karman

1162.84 --> 1165.84
line

1167.679 --> 1171.2800000000002
what if god tells me i've been wrong

1170.16 --> 1174.96
then

1171.28 --> 1179.12
i will draw my conclusions and adapt to

1174.96 --> 1182.32
it right

1179.12 --> 1186.08
have you ever tried it or you

1182.32 --> 1187.9189999999999
just squirt get more angry

1186.08 --> 1189.76
and get more obsessed and start to

1187.919 --> 1193.1200000000001
ignore more things

1189.76 --> 1196.799
right yeah that's god

1193.12 --> 1198.08
judging you for something that you've

1196.799 --> 1201.2
lost focus of

1198.08 --> 1204.24
that's why you become all obsessive

1201.2 --> 1208.4
you become obsessive right

1204.24 --> 1212.32
the obsession that's god telling you

1208.4 --> 1214.64
you're going way out of line

1212.32 --> 1217.52
you're literally not yourself you're not

1214.64 --> 1220.7990000000002
following your own road anymore

1217.52 --> 1224.1589999999999
you're obsessing yeah obsession

1220.799 --> 1225.44
i consider a sin and it doesn't mean

1224.159 --> 1227.2800000000002
that some that

1225.44 --> 1229.1200000000001
something really weighs on you and you

1227.28 --> 1230.799
can't let it go and you keep worrying

1229.12 --> 1234.2399999999998
about it that's not the same thing

1230.799 --> 1237.28
no obsession is surrendering

1234.24 --> 1240.799
to that completely and let it

1237.28 --> 1241.6789999999999
drive you far over all borders of

1240.799 --> 1243.9189999999999
decency

1241.679 --> 1246.8400000000001
breaking all your principles because you

1243.919 --> 1262.96
lose track because you become obsessed

1246.84 --> 1265.1999999999998
yeah it's one of god's punishments

1262.96 --> 1265.2
right

1270.48 --> 1277.84
yeah and i i will apologize to any

1274.64 --> 1277.8400000000001
that deserve it

1278.48 --> 1285.76
and if i make a mistake i will admit it

1282.159 --> 1288.4
but i'm very certain i didn't because

1285.76 --> 1289.6
if i had maken made a mistake i would

1288.4 --> 1292.64
have immediately

1289.6 --> 1293.52
apologized like immediately that's what

1292.64 --> 1295.679
i do

1293.52 --> 1296.8799999999999
because i do make mistakes sometimes and

1295.679 --> 1300.0800000000002
when i do i'm

1296.88 --> 1304.159
very quick very quick to catch on

1300.08 --> 1306.8799999999999
because i'm eager i have hunger hunger

1304.159 --> 1307.44
for correcting my mistakes it's one of

1306.88 --> 1311.44
the most

1307.44 --> 1314.559
honorable delightful thing ever

1311.44 --> 1317.2
it's really i love it i love correcting

1314.559 --> 1317.2
my mistakes

1317.28 --> 1324.08
makes me feel like i'm alive like

1320.32 --> 1326.96
i can i can do it

1324.08 --> 1326.96
i can build

1331.44 --> 1335.28
and one time i've apologized for

1333.28 --> 1335.76
something well i think there's plenty of

1335.28 --> 1338.8799999999999
people

1335.76 --> 1341.12
in the chat right now that can attest to

1338.88 --> 1347.8400000000001
personal situations

1341.12 --> 1347.84
where that has happened

1348.88 --> 1352.3200000000002
for example ajm here we've had plenty of

1351.52 --> 1356.4
bump ins

1352.32 --> 1358.8799999999999
and sometimes he's in a bad mood

1356.4 --> 1361.2
and i misread what he said then he gets

1358.88 --> 1363.5200000000002
pissed off

1361.2 --> 1366.159
and then i yeah hold it very heavily

1363.52 --> 1369.6
against him and then afterward realizing

1366.159 --> 1372.72
wait wait i i misunderstood and this got

1369.6 --> 1374.32
out of hand i'm sorry aj

1372.72 --> 1376.72
and that's happened plenty of times in

1374.32 --> 1376.72
the past

1378.72 --> 1385.1200000000001
and good servant you know that

1382.159 --> 1386.96
we have had like really heavy situations

1385.12 --> 1387.52
together even in private chat and on

1386.96 --> 1390.96
skype

1387.52 --> 1390.96
i've apologized to you

1394.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
right guys

1424.24 --> 1431.84
right hey thanks seeking star wars

1427.6 --> 1431.84
good to see you in this chat

1434.88 --> 1437.679
so there you go

1439.84 --> 1446.6399999999999
oh that's an apology

1443.76 --> 1447.6
yeah that's right that happens sometimes

1446.64 --> 1452.64
or

1447.6 --> 1455.4399999999998
just making an error in judgment

1452.64 --> 1457.44
right temporary and then correcting it

1455.44 --> 1460.64
that's right that's an apology

1457.44 --> 1463.6000000000001
so there you go there you have a one

1460.64 --> 1465.6000000000001
time actually multiple times that i have

1463.6 --> 1469.12
apologized for something

1465.6 --> 1469.12
but it seems like you've already

1470.84 --> 1473.84
forgotten

1492.14 --> 1495.219
[Music]

1498.54 --> 1503.42
[Music]

1505.679 --> 1513.3600000000001
yeah good servant but yeah i

1509.2 --> 1516.159
i it can get ugly and i can get ugly

1513.36 --> 1517.1999999999998
i i try to avoid it at all cost in

1516.159 --> 1521.2
public streams

1517.2 --> 1521.2
because it serves no purpose really

1521.6 --> 1528.559
but a one-on-one situation especially if

1525.44 --> 1531.919
obsession gets involved in some way

1528.559 --> 1534.799
tenaciously then my devilish

1531.919 --> 1537.679
side starts to show and i start to get

1534.799 --> 1537.679
really harsh

1538.24 --> 1545.44
and sometimes that is really

1541.6 --> 1546.7199999999998
what it takes because of the tenacity of

1545.44 --> 1549.919
obsession right

1546.72 --> 1552.72
it obsession

1549.919 --> 1554.48
leads to demonic behavior right and

1552.72 --> 1557.0
that's outside the consciousness

1554.48 --> 1558.559
because that's typically demonic is the

1557.0 --> 1560.88
unconsciousness

1558.559 --> 1562.08
an outside effect taking over the

1560.88 --> 1565.1200000000001
conscious

1562.08 --> 1567.6
without reeling realizing it

1565.12 --> 1568.6399999999999
and when somebody gets demonic like that

1567.6 --> 1572.8799999999999
whether it is by

1568.64 --> 1575.919
accident or by true purpose much rarer

1572.88 --> 1577.1200000000001
then a devilish response is usually the

1575.919 --> 1580.7990000000002
only thing

1577.12 --> 1584.32
i know to really fend it off

1580.799 --> 1587.279
but then afterward if the person

1584.32 --> 1588.48
gets out of their demonically possessed

1587.279 --> 1590.32
state

1588.48 --> 1593.279
which is very much a temporary

1590.32 --> 1595.84
occurrence in most cases

1593.279 --> 1597.279
then they might reflect upon what

1595.84 --> 1599.6
happened be a little hurt

1597.279 --> 1600.72
by my intensity and then i usually get

1599.6 --> 1603.039
back to them and say

1600.72 --> 1603.76
sorry it's like sorry i had to get rough

1603.039 --> 1606.1589999999999
with you

1603.76 --> 1607.36
i don't feel good about getting rough

1606.159 --> 1610.48
but at the time

1607.36 --> 1610.4799999999998
it was necessary

1610.84 --> 1617.6789999999999
right or

1614.559 --> 1619.52
okay i i really went too far i i got a

1617.679 --> 1622.96
little obsessed myself

1619.52 --> 1627.039
in some kind of paranoia towards

1622.96 --> 1630.159
that happens too yeah

1627.039 --> 1632.0
so you got anything else how about you

1630.159 --> 1634.72
apologize all the christians you've what

1632.0 --> 1637.279
apologize for what

1634.72 --> 1637.279
for what

1638.24 --> 1644.88
for telling them exactly what they do

1641.679 --> 1644.88
in technical detail

1645.6 --> 1653.9189999999999
or telling them how they don't

1648.799 --> 1655.2
actually follow christ's own advice

1653.919 --> 1658.24
through what they do

1655.2 --> 1658.24
through their chanting

1661.84 --> 1667.279
and stick to what other people

1665.679 --> 1669.6000000000001
that's what they hold on to when they

1667.279 --> 1671.84
chat

1669.6 --> 1674.9599999999998
what did this other person other than

1671.84 --> 1674.9599999999998
jesus christ say

1675.84 --> 1683.84
i don't apologize for that

1678.88 --> 1683.8400000000001
i don't

1684.88 --> 1690.24
just a human no no he was not just a

1687.84 --> 1694.72
human he is a prophet

1690.24 --> 1698.48
the best of us brightest shining example

1694.72 --> 1702.88
of human conscious ascension

1698.48 --> 1705.76
world had ever seen up until that point

1702.88 --> 1706.24
yeah that's pretty damn special that's

1705.76 --> 1709.12
not

1706.24 --> 1709.1200000000001
just a human

1709.6 --> 1717.36
but he is not god

1714.24 --> 1720.72
because makes no sense when you

1717.36 --> 1724.32
pray to yourself

1720.72 --> 1728.24
as a third person that's where

1724.32 --> 1729.12
logic is destroyed in your mind that's

1728.24 --> 1732.559
where you become

1729.12 --> 1735.84
vulnerable to psychotic influences

1732.559 --> 1738.399
an obsession as is blatantly apparent

1735.84 --> 1739.52
blatantly apparent because that's what's

1738.399 --> 1744.32
happening right

1739.52 --> 1748.8799999999999
that's the demon taking your good will

1744.32 --> 1751.52
and drawing you into nonsense

1748.88 --> 1752.0
an obsession over that nonsense that you

1751.52 --> 1755.039
cannot

1752.0 --> 1756.799
figure out because it makes no sense

1755.039 --> 1759.36
yeah and i'm not going to apologize for

1756.799 --> 1766.72
that i'm just going to point it out

1759.36 --> 1770.1589999999999
again and again and again and again

1766.72 --> 1773.919
do i believe he walked on water

1770.159 --> 1777.1200000000001
yeah yeah i think he did tom parker

1773.919 --> 1780.7990000000002
he probably did i mean i haven't wasn't

1777.12 --> 1785.12
personally there to see it but

1780.799 --> 1788.679
yes i think he just might have

1785.12 --> 1791.6
i have no objection that he had that

1788.679 --> 1796.24
extraordinary very much

1791.6 --> 1796.24
divine ability available to him

1796.88 --> 1799.5200000000002
yes i do

1802.75 --> 1805.849
[Music]

1806.559 --> 1811.76
also because it's no it doesn't seem to

1810.64 --> 1814.96
have been made up

1811.76 --> 1817.919
afterward he communicates

1814.96 --> 1818.559
about it even as it happens all that

1817.919 --> 1823.1200000000001
right

1818.559 --> 1824.8799999999999
that tells me yes that's absolutely real

1823.12 --> 1826.9599999999998
you believe he did well that's fine i

1824.88 --> 1829.7600000000002
see no objection to that right

1826.96 --> 1829.76
i think men

1830.32 --> 1837.279
when infused by extraordinary

1834.08 --> 1841.12
high frequency and purity

1837.279 --> 1842.08
and being assigned right you don't just

1841.12 --> 1845.039
get that

1842.08 --> 1846.0
being assigned appointed through destiny

1845.039 --> 1849.679
through

1846.0 --> 1852.64
prophecy that people

1849.679 --> 1855.1200000000001
jesus christ that he may have absolutely

1852.64 --> 1859.44
have had that ability to do that

1855.12 --> 1862.9599999999998
yes a human that does

1859.44 --> 1866.0
a lot well yeah well yeah they do

1862.96 --> 1878.3990000000001
yeah it's just very

1866.0 --> 1880.72
very rare

1878.399 --> 1880.7199999999998
all right

1885.84 --> 1889.12
thank you seeking star wars

1889.6 --> 1894.48
they knew who else was i know i don't

1892.32 --> 1894.48
know

1901.279 --> 1907.6
why are you straw manning me

1904.64 --> 1909.919
why are you suggesting suggesting that i

1907.6 --> 1909.9189999999999
know

1910.08 --> 1913.12
others that could do it

1915.12 --> 1919.4399999999998
you said it oh really i said oh another

1918.72 --> 1922.799
person

1919.44 --> 1926.0800000000002
definitely did it did i say that

1922.799 --> 1929.279
is that what i said i don't think so

1926.08 --> 1932.96
i said yeah humans could

1929.279 --> 1935.519
do that jesus did it

1932.96 --> 1936.159
but it's extraordinary it's not just

1935.519 --> 1939.279
like oh

1936.159 --> 1941.279
it's just a basic superpower or whatever

1939.279 --> 1942.559
you have to just switch this gene and

1941.279 --> 1949.84
then

1942.559 --> 1949.84
no it's definitely extraordinaire

1951.36 --> 1955.12
said other people do it no i said other

1954.64 --> 1958.24
people

1955.12 --> 1961.5189999999998
could do it i didn't say other people

1958.24 --> 1963.279
do it i don't know another example they

1961.519 --> 1966.24
might be out there

1963.279 --> 1966.24
i don't know about it

1970.64 --> 1975.1200000000001
by denying christ i don't deny christ i

1973.6 --> 1977.6
deny the nonsense

1975.12 --> 1981.5189999999998
chanting that's been made up about him

1977.6 --> 1984.0
that contradicts his own freaking words

1981.519 --> 1987.1200000000001
that's what i'm denying i deny the

1984.0 --> 1987.12
priesthood chants

1987.519 --> 2005.84
the pollution of consciousness

1990.88 --> 2005.8400000000001
and truth

2007.279 --> 2018.48
so kristen you should not be offended

2010.64 --> 2021.519
you should be listening very carefully

2018.48 --> 2021.519
my political talk

2021.919 --> 2025.919
all right my political talk can get a

2025.36 --> 2028.24
little

2025.919 --> 2028.24
rough

2029.919 --> 2036.48
yeah they do it's just very very rare

2033.279 --> 2038.48
it's on record okay well

2036.48 --> 2040.32
maybe you should stop complaining about

2038.48 --> 2042.159
that i already elaborated

2040.32 --> 2045.12
so if you're gonna hold me on my words

2042.159 --> 2047.6000000000001
yeah yeah i am not some apostle i am not

2045.12 --> 2050.72
the return of christ i'm a guy

2047.6 --> 2053.7599999999998
i make mistakes but what i do

2050.72 --> 2057.52
do is i'm a purist

2053.76 --> 2060.7200000000003
and i'll die for that i'll oppose

2057.52 --> 2064.48
every one and everything i know

2060.72 --> 2068.1589999999997
and i'll die a virtually miserable

2064.48 --> 2072.0
painful death because i refuse

2068.159 --> 2073.2000000000003
to [ __ ] i refuse to [ __ ] no matter the

2072.0 --> 2076.24
cost

2073.2 --> 2079.2799999999997
in things that i know

2076.24 --> 2082.879
that i know not guess not think

2079.28 --> 2086.3990000000003
not believe that i know make no sense

2082.879 --> 2089.5989999999997
i refuse no matter the cost

2086.399 --> 2092.0789999999997
and if you're offended by that then you

2089.599 --> 2094.2400000000002
got a problem

2092.079 --> 2095.76
the problem's not with me the problem is

2094.24 --> 2099.359
with you

2095.76 --> 2099.3590000000004
that you don't understand

2099.52 --> 2105.52
that you don't understand what you do

2103.04 --> 2106.079
somebody somebody talked about that

2105.52 --> 2116.88
remember

2106.079 --> 2120.6400000000003
remember they know not what they do

2116.88 --> 2122.96
david blaine this is okay tiny momo

2120.64 --> 2124.72
i don't know man it's david blame is

2122.96 --> 2128.64
just a magician

2124.72 --> 2129.2799999999997
he's very good at it i'm pretty certain

2128.64 --> 2131.52
that

2129.28 --> 2135.0400000000004
the time that he supposedly he walked on

2131.52 --> 2138.72
water it was just a

2135.04 --> 2138.72
elevated bottom thing

2139.04 --> 2145.2
it's hilarious

2142.16 --> 2148.0789999999997
no i'm not gonna dude i

2145.2 --> 2149.2799999999997
don't care it's a straw man to say oh

2148.079 --> 2152.32
other people

2149.28 --> 2155.76
like only

2152.32 --> 2158.079
god himself and not a human

2155.76 --> 2160.7200000000003
could do that that's where things get

2158.079 --> 2160.7200000000003
ridiculous

2161.28 --> 2165.3590000000004
you don't even understand what you're

2163.04 --> 2166.48
trying to create what you're trying to

2165.359 --> 2170.4
define

2166.48 --> 2170.4
in the whole makes no sense

2170.64 --> 2177.5989999999997
why it's fine maybe

2174.16 --> 2180.3999999999996
you know maybe jesus human

2177.599 --> 2182.32
in what he did assigned but he did

2180.4 --> 2185.599
absolutely have

2182.32 --> 2189.44
giant gateway open to the creator

2185.599 --> 2192.96
in himself maybe he's the only one

2189.44 --> 2197.839
the only one ever that has been

2192.96 --> 2197.839
enabled to do that i don't know

2197.92 --> 2205.6800000000003
don't know just know he did it

2202.88 --> 2208.4
and doing that does not make you the

2205.68 --> 2211.44
literal designer and creator of

2208.4 --> 2215.839
all things throughout all time

2211.44 --> 2215.839
yeah that makes no sense

2219.359 --> 2222.4
that's like really tribal belief

2221.52 --> 2224.56
behavior

2222.4 --> 2226.48
like oh something super out of the

2224.56 --> 2229.119
orchestra extraordinary that

2226.48 --> 2230.4
means it must be god oh really you fall

2229.119 --> 2233.52
for on your knees

2230.4 --> 2237.04
for anything you don't understand

2233.52 --> 2237.04
that's terrible behavior

2237.28 --> 2242.96
that's that's spiritual weakness

2240.96 --> 2244.7200000000003
falling on your knees as soon as you

2242.96 --> 2247.359
don't understand something

2244.72 --> 2247.359
it's terrible

2251.52 --> 2254.8
hey nathan oakley

2255.28 --> 2258.48
i had skype closed

2268.839 --> 2271.839
oh

2272.079 --> 2275.2000000000003
okay thanks nathan

2278.64 --> 2282.0789999999997
cool dude

2282.56 --> 2286.32
right yeah i might use this

2287.28 --> 2299.8390000000004
thanks for the title card of this show

2300.0 --> 2304.24
cherry season ends are blue from making

2303.599 --> 2305.92
jam oh

2304.24 --> 2308.3199999999997
nice seeking star wars that sounds

2305.92 --> 2308.32
amazing

2309.52 --> 2317.68
i remember back in old home like

2313.92 --> 2321.359
ago my mother was also always making jam

2317.68 --> 2321.359
from the fruits in the garden there

2321.839 --> 2327.839
of it more than we could eat

2332.96 --> 2339.44
so the cherry yield is good

2336.8 --> 2341.2000000000003
and not birds haven't like stolen all

2339.44 --> 2342.4
the cherries because that's what they

2341.2 --> 2355.839
typically did

2342.4 --> 2355.839
in our garden

2362.36 --> 2365.4990000000003
[Music]

2380.839 --> 2383.839
hmm

2392.88 --> 2397.52
ah much bear thank you so much for being

2395.839 --> 2401.68
here in chat

2397.52 --> 2401.68
it means a lot to me to have support in

2408.839 --> 2411.839
this

2434.72 --> 2439.839
these yeah these are great

2444.56 --> 2450.0
if i had it a serious piece of land i

2447.44 --> 2452.319
i'd get a beehive not even to tap it for

2450.0 --> 2455.92
honey just to have the bees around

2452.319 --> 2458.88
just to have bees around is great

2455.92 --> 2458.88
i love the creatures

2460.319 --> 2463.44
i wouldn't even like try to take their

2462.8 --> 2467.92
honey

2463.44 --> 2470.16
just like just having the bees is

2467.92 --> 2473.2000000000003
now of course if they had a lot of bees

2470.16 --> 2480.48
then eventually like yeah okay

2473.2 --> 2483.04
honey of course

2480.48 --> 2485.44
but yeah bees are more than just for

2483.04 --> 2485.44
honey

2486.48 --> 2489.68
they're great for the plants they're

2488.96 --> 2494.4
great to

2489.68 --> 2509.839
uh pollinate crops

2494.4 --> 2509.839
nature thrives under bees

2527.28 --> 2533.599
so so a au backup

2530.48 --> 2536.64
53 i guess you're one of those

2533.599 --> 2540.1600000000003
boomer ball christians

2536.64 --> 2544.24
right the earth is a ball the ball

2540.16 --> 2547.359
is in the bible and and

2544.24 --> 2550.9599999999996
like the most ridiculous version

2547.359 --> 2553.04
interpretation christianity you hold on

2550.96 --> 2556.56
top of that so you are

2553.04 --> 2564.4
pretty much the definition of a [ __ ]

2556.56 --> 2568.56
christian aren't you

2564.4 --> 2568.56
and probably a bit of a boomer as well

2569.04 --> 2579.839
it's just an amplifying factor

2590.839 --> 2596.16
oh

2592.56 --> 2599.68
i think that maybe a you backup

2596.16 --> 2603.2
i think the au may just be ow

2599.68 --> 2603.2
it should happen to be the

2603.76 --> 2607.8390000000004
like how we

2611.44 --> 2618.88
verbally express pain in dutch

2614.96 --> 2621.76
we say ow a you

2618.88 --> 2623.839
so maybe he's just hurting he doesn't

2621.76 --> 2626.4
even realize it

2623.839 --> 2626.4
ironic

2631.04 --> 2637.7599999999998
the ow back up

2634.64 --> 2640.72
his balls are hurting

2637.76 --> 2644.0
you can't explain me to your rights are

2640.72 --> 2647.2
can you exceed me your rights are

2644.0 --> 2651.92
yeah i could explain it

2647.2 --> 2651.9199999999996
sure i can i've made episodes about it

2652.88 --> 2659.52
it's kind of a complicated subject

2656.4 --> 2661.359
but what i know for sure wherever it's

2659.52 --> 2665.119
coming from it's coming from

2661.359 --> 2667.7599999999998
within the container

2665.119 --> 2669.52
not coming from out there in an endless

2667.76 --> 2674.8
vacuum of outer space

2669.52 --> 2674.8
drifting rock that that doesn't exist

2674.839 --> 2681.119
impossible

2677.2 --> 2681.1189999999997
there is no meteor belt

2681.44 --> 2688.64
there's no drifting rocks

2684.72 --> 2693.839
in a gravity-less environment out there

2688.64 --> 2696.96
that's bull right but hey apparently

2693.839 --> 2700.0
big freaking rocks do fall down

2696.96 --> 2702.96
or rocks things whatever they are

2700.0 --> 2704.319
physical things do apparently come down

2702.96 --> 2707.359
sometimes

2704.319 --> 2710.48
somehow never

2707.359 --> 2714.0789999999997
really a straight downwards angle though

2710.48 --> 2714.56
it's always diagonal never seen a meteor

2714.079 --> 2718.2400000000002
go

2714.56 --> 2720.4
exactly straight down never seen it

2718.24 --> 2722.0789999999997
that only happens when you see the

2720.4 --> 2725.76
falling stars

2722.079 --> 2728.6400000000003
which in my expert opinion

2725.76 --> 2728.88
falling stars are not physical they are

2728.64 --> 2731.04
a

2728.88 --> 2732.319
holographic phenomena as part of the

2731.04 --> 2734.72
globe of the heavens

2732.319 --> 2735.92
the celestials it's a purely celestial

2734.72 --> 2738.0789999999997
phenomenon

2735.92 --> 2739.119
it's different it's a separate

2738.079 --> 2741.8390000000004
phenomenon

2739.119 --> 2742.319
from the times where actual physical

2741.839 --> 2745.92
things

2742.319 --> 2747.04
do come down diagonally wherever they

2745.92 --> 2749.6800000000003
come from

2747.04 --> 2750.24
right who knows how that works is it

2749.68 --> 2754.16
being

2750.24 --> 2757.1189999999997
launched with a giant giant

2754.16 --> 2758.24
ancient or perhaps hypertech modern

2757.119 --> 2761.52
catapult

2758.24 --> 2765.5989999999997
is it being launched from another realm

2761.52 --> 2768.16
neighboring us it's like a

2765.599 --> 2770.4
thing they do or is it even being done

2768.16 --> 2772.7999999999997
from within the realm it's

2770.4 --> 2775.119
a bunch of sneaky freemasons doing that

2772.8 --> 2778.2400000000002
[ __ ] i don't know

2775.119 --> 2781.119
maybe it is like a piece of

2778.24 --> 2782.0
rock or sediment that's next to an

2781.119 --> 2785.04
apparent

2782.0 --> 2787.119
dome or a flat top

2785.04 --> 2788.72
something up there a piece of sediment

2787.119 --> 2791.6800000000003
breaking off

2788.72 --> 2792.56
the vibration or whatever and then

2791.68 --> 2797.52
coming down

2792.56 --> 2801.2
and some reason getting a diagonal angle

2797.52 --> 2801.2
still don't see how that will work

2801.28 --> 2805.2000000000003
i don't know for sure but what i do know

2804.079 --> 2810.48
they're not

2805.2 --> 2813.359
floaty rocks in outer space

2810.48 --> 2813.359
not what they are

2814.839 --> 2817.839
right

2847.119 --> 2850.4
well it seems like some people are very

2849.839 --> 2853.7599999999998
eager

2850.4 --> 2858.1600000000003
for nathan's flat earth debates

2853.76 --> 2861.119
sure they'll be over the chat

2858.16 --> 2861.1189999999997
in an hour time

2862.8 --> 2866.319
won't make space tea

2870.16 --> 2873.839
i got some space tea for you

2879.26 --> 2882.429
[Music]

2884.839 --> 2887.839
cheers

2889.2 --> 2894.16
what's diffraction it's part of optics

2892.8 --> 2898.8
lift

2894.16 --> 2902.5589999999997
it's optics it happens provably palpably

2898.8 --> 2905.92
you know what happens when

2902.559 --> 2910.48
take an object put it on a

2905.92 --> 2913.6800000000003
measured measure confirmed flat surface

2910.48 --> 2914.0
and you observe that object at a very

2913.68 --> 2916.48
low

2914.0 --> 2918.96
observation out in relation to that

2916.48 --> 2921.359
surface and then you move it away

2918.96 --> 2922.4
back and forth and but especially very

2921.359 --> 2924.5589999999997
very far away

2922.4 --> 2927.359
yeah you'll start to notice this weird

2924.559 --> 2930.559
little thing that happens

2927.359 --> 2932.88
the bottom of it becomes concealed

2930.559 --> 2933.6800000000003
from the observer you don't see the

2932.88 --> 2937.359
bottom of it

2933.68 --> 2940.839
right on a confirmed measured

2937.359 --> 2943.5989999999997
flat surface like it's engineered to be

2940.839 --> 2945.7599999999998
perfectly flat perfectly

2943.599 --> 2946.6400000000003
like not even a tenth of a millimeter

2945.76 --> 2949.2000000000003
deviation

2946.64 --> 2950.64
perfectly smooth perfectly flat take

2949.2 --> 2952.64
that object

2950.64 --> 2953.92
you look over that flat surface you move

2952.64 --> 2956.24
the object away

2953.92 --> 2957.2000000000003
and then at some point guaranteed

2956.24 --> 2960.5589999999997
because this is

2957.2 --> 2961.7599999999998
optics inherent the bottom of it seems

2960.559 --> 2965.76
to disappear

2961.76 --> 2969.28
seems to i call it concealment

2965.76 --> 2972.7200000000003
yeah that's diffraction it happens

2969.28 --> 2975.44
always right callers

2972.72 --> 2977.2799999999997
like to suggest that that bottom-up

2975.44 --> 2980.7200000000003
concealment effect which is

2977.28 --> 2985.28
optics inherent happening with confirmed

2980.72 --> 2988.72
flat surfaces yeah they like to suggest

2985.28 --> 2992.1600000000003
that is earth curve obstruction

2988.72 --> 2993.7599999999998
because of a spherical nature of that

2992.16 --> 2998.0
surface you're looking at

2993.76 --> 3003.119
right but that doesn't work because

2998.0 --> 3006.48
the same effect happens on confirmed

3003.119 --> 3013.839
measured flat surfaces

3006.48 --> 3013.839
do you understand

3036.559 --> 3043.0400000000004
yeah nathan oakley it's ridiculous

3040.48 --> 3044.079
these guys are ridiculous hey hey

3043.04 --> 3047.2
numpties

3044.079 --> 3050.48
numpties hey you back up

3047.2 --> 3054.64
lift you numpties

3050.48 --> 3058.72
nathan's panel in this card is open

3054.64 --> 3062.0789999999997
you can go in there and talk to them

3058.72 --> 3063.4399999999996
talk to nathan about it yeah it's not an

3062.079 --> 3067.119
echo chamber

3063.44 --> 3070.079
it has an open discord panel

3067.119 --> 3071.119
you can get in there and talk about this

3070.079 --> 3074.319
make your

3071.119 --> 3076.2400000000002
argument yeah unless

3074.319 --> 3078.24
of course like you're doing right now in

3076.24 --> 3081.68
chat you just at home

3078.24 --> 3085.359
then you will grill you for the fundy

3081.68 --> 3088.5589999999997
or the anti-flat earther that you are

3085.359 --> 3090.4
and start berating you right

3088.559 --> 3092.079
because you're not making an argument

3090.4 --> 3095.6800000000003
you're just at homing

3092.079 --> 3099.04
you don't have an argument you're just

3095.68 --> 3100.24
squirting over your frustration that you

3099.04 --> 3103.52
can't

3100.24 --> 3107.04
rub your delusion about reality

3103.52 --> 3110.319
onto other people so you then get

3107.04 --> 3112.16
in your frustration make a little room

3110.319 --> 3114.8
in your consciousness

3112.16 --> 3115.359
or that little demonic obsession yeah

3114.8 --> 3119.119
yeah

3115.359 --> 3121.92
but demonic possession you enter you

3119.119 --> 3123.359
and then you start making ridiculous

3121.92 --> 3126.319
claims

3123.359 --> 3127.359
get very rough for no reason obsessive

3126.319 --> 3131.2
behavior

3127.359 --> 3133.2
ad homing yeah because you can't handle

3131.2 --> 3136.24
the truth

3133.2 --> 3138.16
and you start accusing person that's

3136.24 --> 3140.0
triggering you

3138.16 --> 3142.5589999999997
for all kinds of things of not letting

3140.0 --> 3144.96
you speak when you have nothing to say

3142.559 --> 3146.7200000000003
you don't have an argument

3144.96 --> 3150.079
and everything you say about him is

3146.72 --> 3153.4399999999996
simply not true provably so

3150.079 --> 3157.119
can't handle it right you can go

3153.44 --> 3160.16
to discord right now to nathan oakley's

3157.119 --> 3162.1600000000003

3165.76 --> 3170.7200000000003

and it seems like you're not listening

3184.319 --> 3186.72

3190.48 --> 3197.119
ah okay you are listening i guess you

3194.0 --> 3200.24
your dementia just made you forget then

3197.119 --> 3202.7200000000003
that i just explained to you exactly

3200.24 --> 3206.16
what diffraction is

3202.72 --> 3208.9599999999996
and the associated phenomenon within

3206.16 --> 3210.0
optics i explained it to you there's no

3208.96 --> 3212.8
need to ask

3210.0 --> 3215.119
nathan so i need to heckle him in my

3212.8 --> 3223.8390000000004
chat because i already gave you

3215.119 --> 3223.839
the explanation live on the show

3234.839 --> 3237.839
um

3242.48 --> 3246.079
i don't give a [ __ ] hey you back up

3244.559 --> 3249.0400000000004
nathan can say whatever the [ __ ] he

3246.079 --> 3249.04
wants in my chat

3252.079 --> 3256.48
if you ask a question whoever whoever

3255.04 --> 3259.359
you're gonna ask right

3256.48 --> 3261.28
i don't care this is my show if somebody

3259.359 --> 3265.7999999999997
asks a question

3261.28 --> 3269.28
and i feel that i can give my expert

3265.8 --> 3269.8390000000004
explanation as an answer to that

3269.28 --> 3271.8390000000004
question

3269.839 --> 3273.04
instead of somebody else then i will

3271.839 --> 3276.48
take that liberty

3273.04 --> 3281.2799999999997
to do it yeah

3276.48 --> 3284.88
and if you then don't listen to it

3281.28 --> 3288.079
start repeating the question then

3284.88 --> 3290.7200000000003
you enter dangerous territory

3288.079 --> 3291.3590000000004
because then you're obviously ignoring

3290.72 --> 3294.5589999999997
me

3291.359 --> 3294.5589999999997
i don't appreciate that

3305.52 --> 3308.16
hey lift

3308.72 --> 3312.24
yeah you're getting a timeout buddy

3310.799 --> 3321.839
you're squirting

3312.24 --> 3321.839
get a point

3323.44 --> 3327.28
you don't have to tell people to not

3325.119 --> 3329.6800000000003
take you serious nobody takes you

3327.28 --> 3329.6800000000003
serious

3331.76 --> 3337.76
a conversation well you're having a

3333.92 --> 3337.76
conversation in my chat

3341.599 --> 3347.04
this is not a free for all side chat

3345.04 --> 3348.16
like at nathan oakley's where the chat

3347.04 --> 3352.0
is really just

3348.16 --> 3352.799
secondary this show the flat earth early

3352.0 --> 3355.92
bird show

3352.799 --> 3356.88
the chat is very direct directly

3355.92 --> 3360.64
connected to

3356.88 --> 3362.0
my activities on the show so this is not

3360.64 --> 3365.7599999999998
a place where you're going to

3362.0 --> 3368.559
elaborately have a discussion

3365.76 --> 3369.3590000000004
with somebody else in chat and just

3368.559 --> 3371.599
ignore me

3369.359 --> 3372.64
that's not going to happen here that's

3371.599 --> 3377.839
not how this

3372.64 --> 3377.839
show works

3388.0 --> 3394.799
yeah no he doesn't have an open chat

3391.04 --> 3398.24
sometimes but most of the times he does

3394.799 --> 3400.96
right especially during the premieres

3398.24 --> 3405.839
there's open chat during every premiere

3400.96 --> 3405.839
premieres are never members only

3408.88 --> 3412.319
and besides that's just the chat right

3411.839 --> 3415.52
the

3412.319 --> 3418.5589999999997
the chat the youtube chat

3415.52 --> 3422.319
right nathan never closes

3418.559 --> 3426.079
his discord panel during the live show

3422.319 --> 3429.119
and the after show you can right now

3426.079 --> 3431.599
join the discord panel

3429.119 --> 3432.2400000000002
for nathan's live show and become part

3431.599 --> 3436.0
of

3432.24 --> 3436.8799999999997
his show yeah nobody's stopping you but

3436.0 --> 3439.68
you

3436.88 --> 3439.6800000000003
from doing that

3443.599 --> 3447.839
hey steamy traveler

people disturbing the flow well

3460.319 --> 3465.119
see me traveler yeah dude when when the

3463.04 --> 3469.04
trolls insist on rolling in here that's

3465.119 --> 3469.04
just what's gonna happen unfortunately

3472.64 --> 3478.24
right and i just kind of use them anyway

3475.92 --> 3479.52
it's a good excuse for me to basically

3478.24 --> 3482.319
start ramming

3479.52 --> 3482.799
details into people's heads that most of

3482.319 --> 3485.599
you

3482.799 --> 3486.559
that actually follow the show because

3485.599 --> 3490.6400000000003
they're interested

3486.559 --> 3492.559
already know sometimes certain points

3490.64 --> 3494.72
are just good points to make

3492.559 --> 3497.119
even though most of you already know

3494.72 --> 3497.1189999999997
about it

3501.44 --> 3505.839
join please explain well why don't you

3503.44 --> 3508.7200000000003
go to nathan oakley 9080 channel

3505.839 --> 3508.72
angel hd

3509.04 --> 3516.799
go to a video any video

3513.119 --> 3520.1600000000003
look in the description box and then

3516.799 --> 3522.88
search for discord

3520.16 --> 3523.2799999999997
and you'll find a link that'll bring you

3522.88 --> 3528.1600000000003
to

3523.28 --> 3530.559
nathan oakley's discord server or rather

3528.16 --> 3532.5589999999997
betty's discord server which nathan

3530.559 --> 3536.079
oakley utilizes and then you'll see

3532.559 --> 3545.8390000000004
the live show within that server and

3536.079 --> 3545.8390000000004
then you can join that

3548.079 --> 3555.52
oh yeah oh so you're already gonna give

3551.599 --> 3555.52
up before you're even gonna start then

3556.799 --> 3563.44
you back up oh cool angel a.d

3560.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
go for it man go for it or girl

3563.44 --> 3573.839
you know

3575.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
no andrea huddle [ __ ]

3579.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
when he went to space

3601.839 --> 3608.0
three times oh well

3605.2 --> 3610.24
did you have anything worthwhile to say

3608.0 --> 3612.319
or did you just do the same things that

3610.24 --> 3614.0
you've been doing in this chat

3612.319 --> 3616.0
because then i'm not surprised that you

3614.0 --> 3617.92
got muted every time

3616.0 --> 3620.96
so far you're just blabbering a bunch of

3617.92 --> 3620.96
at home [ __ ]

3627.359 --> 3630.72
our detailed discussion well steamy

3629.119 --> 3634.6400000000003
travelers

3630.72 --> 3636.72
dude don't worry about it it'll be back

3634.64 --> 3638.72
today is just going to be a conflict

3636.72 --> 3640.9599999999996
date because i'm already kind of pissed

3638.72 --> 3640.9599999999996
off

3641.2 --> 3645.68
or getting a strike on my show from

3644.24 --> 3647.52
friday

3645.68 --> 3650.5589999999997
just because of the title just because

3647.52 --> 3654.4
they didn't get the joke

3650.559 --> 3655.28
and hey england just lost the finals in

3654.4 --> 3656.88
football

3655.28 --> 3658.4
so there's going to be a lot of pissed

3656.88 --> 3660.079
off british people today

3658.4 --> 3661.6800000000003
there's they're going to be triggered

3660.079 --> 3662.4
whether they care about it or not it's

3661.68 --> 3665.839
going to echo

3662.4 --> 3670.88
just going to shine through so

3665.839 --> 3685.839
today was never going to be

3670.88 --> 3685.839
just a smooth talking about subjects day

3695.52 --> 3700.079
search flat moon what's the excuse well

3698.0 --> 3701.599
he didn't even go beyond the carmen line

3700.079 --> 3704.799
research flat moon

3701.599 --> 3705.119
dumbass apparently you don't even know

3704.799 --> 3708.88
the

3705.119 --> 3712.0
the official parameters of your own

3708.88 --> 3715.6800000000003
freaking model you don't even know

3712.0 --> 3718.079
that he technically didn't go to space

3715.68 --> 3720.24
you don't know that because you

3718.079 --> 3721.6800000000003
apparently don't even know how your own

3720.24 --> 3724.799
model works

3721.68 --> 3729.2
you still conclude

3724.799 --> 3729.2
still conclude that he did

3731.039 --> 3741.8390000000004
50 miles in the u.s i didn't didn't go

3734.0 --> 3741.839
beyond the karma line

3761.76 --> 3766.4
all right yeah steamy traveler

3764.88 --> 3768.0
the show's not over yet you know you

3766.4 --> 3770.799
still got

3768.0 --> 3770.799
40 minutes

3773.92 --> 3783.839
i'm just gonna probably ban these

3777.119 --> 3783.839
anti-flat earther scumbags

3798.319 --> 3804.64
[ __ ] out you to

3801.359 --> 3806.88
get the [ __ ] out

3804.64 --> 3806.8799999999997
and

3809.039 --> 3813.2000000000003
you get the [ __ ] up hi

3814.4 --> 3819.44
so let's move on to something more

3822.839 --> 3825.839
productive

3830.64 --> 3839.839
steamy traveler come back

3850.839 --> 3867.839
hello to vamco

3877.119 --> 3884.319
so they basically made an arbitrary line

3881.039 --> 3887.92
at 50 miles they say in that space

3884.319 --> 3889.92
so what actually makes it space then

3887.92 --> 3895.839
just like oh now we're going to say it's

3889.92 --> 3895.839
50 miles

3895.92 --> 3900.48
right so you go 50 miles up from the

3899.039 --> 3903.44
surface

3900.48 --> 3904.559
and then you just say okay beyond that

3903.44 --> 3908.48
it's no longer

3904.559 --> 3910.4
atmosphere it's space

3908.48 --> 3913.039
all right so what actually makes it

3910.4 --> 3913.039
space then

3914.799 --> 3918.559
do any of you know i'm not gonna ask the

3917.599 --> 3921.599
squirters they're

3918.559 --> 3922.0
they are all out of here because they're

3921.599 --> 3924.559
just gonna

3922.0 --> 3926.559
waste everybody's time and start whining

3924.559 --> 3927.92
like a bunch of anti-flat earthers that

3926.559 --> 3930.2400000000002
they are

3927.92 --> 3937.839
sorry for having wasted all of your time

3930.24 --> 3937.839
by not instantly banning them

3947.52 --> 3965.839
steamy traveler come back

3950.96 --> 3965.839
i banned them all

4003.28 --> 4009.039
all right i'm look

4006.559 --> 4009.599
that's fine you know if the us wants to

4009.039 --> 4011.599
declare

4009.599 --> 4012.7200000000003
50 miles to be the karman line that's

4011.599 --> 4017.76
cute

4012.72 --> 4021.359
but they then say beyond that it's space

4017.76 --> 4024.1600000000003
what actually defines

4021.359 --> 4025.0389999999998
beyond the 50 mile space what actually

4024.16 --> 4027.92
defines

4025.039 --> 4030.6400000000003
space to them other than being just

4027.92 --> 4034.48
beyond the 50 mile line

4030.64 --> 4036.799
what makes it space really

4034.48 --> 4037.839
like what is the real difference why

4036.799 --> 4043.2
would they assign

4037.839 --> 4043.2
50 miles to that line that's my question

4045.28 --> 4049.3590000000004
is there anything about it beyond the

4048.16 --> 4052.64
arbitrary

4049.359 --> 4063.839
appointment of the 50 mile line

4052.64 --> 4063.839
is there anything different at all

4088.559 --> 4091.8390000000004
okay so there's more

4092.559 --> 4096.159000000001
assignments to that arbitrary nature

4095.44 --> 4098.4800000000005
then

4096.159 --> 4102.0
that's cute but is there physically

4098.48 --> 4102.0
actually any kind of difference

4103.679 --> 4108.08
that they can prove by the way right

4106.0 --> 4111.04
just like they claimed

4108.08 --> 4112.3189999999995
oh yeah when the last boost rocket boost

4111.04 --> 4115.04
of the

4112.319 --> 4115.52
stops that's when they unbuckle and they

4115.04 --> 4119.199
be

4115.52 --> 4119.1990000000005
floatless they go float

4119.279 --> 4124.56
right is that supposedly what happens

4122.88 --> 4126.400000000001
beyond that 50 miles

4124.56 --> 4128.719
is that what they claim is the

4126.4 --> 4132.639999999999
difference it didn't show it of course

4128.719 --> 4133.839
right they don't show it only upon

4132.64 --> 4137.359
descent

4133.839 --> 4141.04
yeah we know but is

4137.359 --> 4143.759
that what they claim that's my question

4141.04 --> 4144.839
is that the difference after 50 miles

4143.759 --> 4148.159
you become

4144.839 --> 4148.88
floaty lower gravity is that the claim i

4148.159 --> 4151.839
want to know

4148.88 --> 4152.400000000001
from you guys in chat is that what they

4151.839 --> 4156.0
claim

4152.4 --> 4161.839
is the thing that happens after 50 miles

4156.0 --> 4161.839
is that it

4193.92 --> 4203.84
puma virus dude

4204.64 --> 4211.52
yeah yeah the century and

4208.719 --> 4213.679
in outer space yeah that would suck a

4211.52 --> 4217.84
lot

4213.679 --> 4217.84
dude you'd probably get spaced

4217.92 --> 4231.84
it's that much of a hazard

4237.28 --> 4241.759999999999
right so nobody is actually

4241.84 --> 4245.84
addressing what i asked

4255.36 --> 4273.839999999999
right angel hd well yeah it nathan

4258.48 --> 4273.839999999999
oakley came up with the terminology

4279.12 --> 4287.84
i don't know that

4288.48 --> 4296.32
all right agm no worries now i asked

4292.64 --> 4300.719
if that's if the claim

4296.32 --> 4303.04
about the carmen line the 50 mile high

4300.719 --> 4304.0
if there is an official claim that

4303.04 --> 4307.36
beyond

4304.0 --> 4310.56
that line you supposedly

4307.36 --> 4313.44
become weightless at the zero g

4310.56 --> 4314.0
scenario now of course you don't have to

4313.44 --> 4316.48
remind

4314.0 --> 4318.4
me about the reality that's not what i'm

4316.48 --> 4319.28
asking because i know that that doesn't

4318.4 --> 4322.32
exist

4319.28 --> 4324.48
it only happens when you

4322.32 --> 4326.96
fall at a certain rate and then you

4324.48 --> 4329.44
effectively negate relative density so

4326.96 --> 4330.2390000000005
everything becomes floaty alike like the

4329.44 --> 4331.919999999999
vomit comment

4330.239 --> 4333.5199999999995
yeah you don't have to tell me i'm

4331.92 --> 4337.76
asking specifically

4333.52 --> 4340.84
if they have the claim

4337.76 --> 4343.679
that beyond 50 miles you're supposedly

4340.84 --> 4346.8
weightless is that the claim

4343.679 --> 4350.32
because that's what i kind of got out of

4346.8 --> 4353.679
the virgin galactic thing yesterday

4350.32 --> 4355.04
they said oh we're going to unbuckle now

4353.679 --> 4357.36
and they're going to be floaty and then

4355.04 --> 4357.84
they didn't show it until the last

4357.36 --> 4361.04
minute

4357.84 --> 4361.04
in the descent phase

4367.679 --> 4371.84
so that was my question

4386.56 --> 4390.64
no bob the science guy it's always funny

4390.239 --> 4393.5199999999995
oh

4390.64 --> 4395.12
ban people you oh really so you don't

4393.52 --> 4397.120000000001
just answer the question you're just

4395.12 --> 4398.0
going to complain about me banning

4397.12 --> 4400.159
people

4398.0 --> 4402.159
suggesting that they could answer the

4400.159 --> 4404.48
question when none of you have

4402.159 --> 4406.639999999999
ever proven that you can answer the

4404.48 --> 4409.04
question

4406.64 --> 4411.6
most of you just spend time at homing

4409.04 --> 4416.48
and avoiding

4411.6 --> 4420.320000000001
answers two questions given

4416.48 --> 4420.32
hey julio kevin good to see you

4421.12 --> 4424.8
back from vacation welcome back

4425.44 --> 4429.199
oh mind a god long time no see

4435.36 --> 4443.28
i can easily okay well answer then

4439.76 --> 4447.12
ask you nicely now i already did

4443.28 --> 4449.36
is there a claim that above 50 miles

4447.12 --> 4455.28
which is declared the karman line

4449.36 --> 4469.839999999999
you become weight loss

4455.28 --> 4469.84
is that the claim

4479.6 --> 4486.400000000001
wow see dude even freaking akuma virus

4483.28 --> 4486.4
can answer that question

4487.679 --> 4491.1990000000005
that isn't what the karma line is oh

4489.84 --> 4494.64
really

4491.199 --> 4495.12
so what makes the karman line other than

4494.64 --> 4498.96
an

4495.12 --> 4501.5199999999995
arbitrary assignment garmin line is 100

4498.96 --> 4504.32
kilometers what

4501.52 --> 4504.320000000001
oh okay

4506.08 --> 4512.96
is it i just got okay now i'm just

4510.0 --> 4515.12
confused so is that real pam cowell is

4512.96 --> 4515.12
that

4516.56 --> 4523.4400000000005
the us faa definition isn't

4520.08 --> 4526.64
it so it's really just the us

4523.44 --> 4529.199
declaration so

4526.64 --> 4531.679
can we then conclude that it is a

4529.199 --> 4531.678999999999
complete

4536.84 --> 4539.84
follow-up

4541.84 --> 4568.2390000000005
i'm a bit weirded out by that

4552.159 --> 4568.239
hey hey you what

4575.6 --> 4583.4400000000005
what the [ __ ] what does that even mean

4580.56 --> 4585.679
the karman line is where the velocity

4583.44 --> 4589.199
required to generate enough

4585.679 --> 4593.04
lift to counter the weight of the craft

4589.199 --> 4593.04
equals orbital speed

4593.52 --> 4599.040000000001
what does that that doesn't make any how

4596.64 --> 4599.04
is that

4599.76 --> 4602.719
what does that mean

4602.96 --> 4611.44
it's where lift requires a speed

4607.04 --> 4613.679
what so what does that effectively mean

4611.44 --> 4616.799999999999
that that's like a

4613.679 --> 4617.679
something that relates to vehicles doing

4616.8 --> 4620.159000000001
things

4617.679 --> 4621.36
right that's like technical how does

4620.159 --> 4624.0
that actually

4621.36 --> 4624.719
make any kind of an influence or

4624.0 --> 4627.92
whatever

4624.719 --> 4630.719
on the realm what's different what's

4627.92 --> 4630.719
different about it

4631.679 --> 4638.32
rather than an arbitrary assignment

4635.52 --> 4640.88
like oh it's just this is where we call

4638.32 --> 4640.88
it different

4642.159 --> 4651.839999999999
understand this

4651.92 --> 4656.0
yeah so that's exactly what i said i

4654.239 --> 4656.959999999999
know what lift is you don't have to tell

4656.0 --> 4659.04
me

4656.96 --> 4662.08
that has to do with engineering what the

4659.04 --> 4665.84
hell does that have to do with

4662.08 --> 4665.84
at a carbon line

4666.96 --> 4672.88
so there is literally nothing different

4670.8 --> 4674.56
there's no less gravity because of the

4672.88 --> 4678.400000000001
distance

4674.56 --> 4678.88
gravity and yeah the air is a little

4678.4 --> 4681.36
thinner

4678.88 --> 4682.4800000000005
well it gets thinner the higher you go

4681.36 --> 4685.199
anyway

4682.48 --> 4687.199
right now change other than that is the

4685.199 --> 4689.44
pressure gradient

4687.199 --> 4689.44
so

4690.64 --> 4694.159000000001
so according to you bob the science guy

4693.52 --> 4698.8
it's

4694.159 --> 4702.159
because of engineering that they declare

4698.8 --> 4705.52
the karman line to be important somehow

4702.159 --> 4707.679
for vehicles it doesn't within the realm

4705.52 --> 4711.280000000001
actually have any significance other

4707.679 --> 4711.28
than that is that what you're saying

4714.719 --> 4720.159
what the hell is even orbital speed

4716.64 --> 4722.0
supposed to mean

4720.159 --> 4725.36
that's already presupposing that there

4722.0 --> 4725.36
is such a thing as an orbit

4728.88 --> 4735.36
oh my god mind a god no no we can't

4733.679 --> 4737.679
what the hell is wrong with you you

4735.36 --> 4737.679
freak

4738.159 --> 4743.04
jesus can't believe you

4747.12 --> 4763.12
no excuse for something that

4750.48 --> 4766.5599999999995
stupid dude

4763.12 --> 4769.12
oh hey troy shukar shuka thank you for

4766.56 --> 4772.56
the five dollar super chat donation

4769.12 --> 4776.5599999999995
but they said it was 62 miles

4772.56 --> 4779.92
edge of gravity holding them back

4776.56 --> 4780.8
right but not 50 miles then this is

4779.92 --> 4782.8
weird

4780.8 --> 4784.88
also a lower airplane well that lower

4782.8 --> 4786.96
air pressure is everywhere

4784.88 --> 4788.96
like the higher you go the lower the air

4786.96 --> 4791.84
pressure that's always going to be there

4788.96 --> 4791.84
right

4792.88 --> 4799.76
would you think that

4796.64 --> 4802.159000000001
the karmal line also relates to the

4799.76 --> 4805.52
lessening of the presupposed gravity

4802.159 --> 4805.92
grip right because other people in chat

4805.52 --> 4810.080000000001
here

4805.92 --> 4810.08
are disclaiming that and entirely

4815.84 --> 4819.360000000001
okay well bob the science guy another

4817.6 --> 4822.159000000001
one writes the dust yeah

4819.36 --> 4824.639
you mean like virgin galactic yesterday

4822.159 --> 4828.08
that was claimed to go into space

4824.639 --> 4831.1990000000005
but according to your own

4828.08 --> 4834.08
your own arbitrary reassignment

4831.199 --> 4838.48
that's simply not true so nobody went to

4834.08 --> 4838.48
space yesterday then bob the science guy

4842.239 --> 4845.678999999999
stop the science guy i'm talking to the

4845.12 --> 4848.639
guy

4845.679 --> 4851.28
who gave me a super chat it's not my

4848.639 --> 4854.96
opinion

4851.28 --> 4855.599999999999
don't straw man me or i'm going to ban

4854.96 --> 4857.679
you

4855.6 --> 4861.84
and don't [ __ ] call me ranty a piece

4857.679 --> 4861.84
of [ __ ]

4863.76 --> 4870.96
he did hit 80 oh really

4868.0 --> 4871.6
now they did wow the information i'm

4870.96 --> 4875.84
getting here

4871.6 --> 4875.84
is all over the place today

4876.719 --> 4880.2390000000005
over the place i'm getting different

4878.48 --> 4882.159
types of information from different

4880.239 --> 4883.759999999999
people everybody's making their claim oh

4882.159 --> 4885.12
that this is where the carbon line is no

4883.76 --> 4886.08
that is where the carbon line is now

4885.12 --> 4888.08
this

4886.08 --> 4889.92
is the distance they made no that is the

4888.08 --> 4893.679
distance they need oh this is what i

4889.92 --> 4894.96
do does anybody actually have

4893.679 --> 4897.92
what is your source where are you

4894.96 --> 4903.84
getting this this is very very confusing

4897.92 --> 4903.84
from you ballers with your claims

4930.159 --> 4934.799999999999
oh bob the science guy hey you're not

4933.679 --> 4938.0
the first one

4934.8 --> 4938.639
to get into my chat i have been talking

4938.0 --> 4942.32
to

4938.639 --> 4946.2390000000005
other people then you

4942.32 --> 4947.36
before this yeah i know it's very hard

4946.239 --> 4950.959999999999
for somebody

4947.36 --> 4953.04
total solipsistic prison to realize that

4950.96 --> 4956.159
there are other people

4953.04 --> 4959.84
out there yeah

4956.159 --> 4959.839999999999
that also say things

4997.84 --> 5001.84
huh okay again

5007.6 --> 5011.280000000001
yeah well mind of god take it somewhere

5010.719 --> 5029.84
else

5011.28 --> 5029.84
i don't want you here anymore get out

5035.12 --> 5042.239
what you did is called cocking and lying

5038.48 --> 5045.36
to yourself for relief

5042.239 --> 5048.4
i cannot think of a more repulsive

5045.36 --> 5051.759999999999
expression of weakness yeah

5048.4 --> 5054.879999999999
get out oh

5051.76 --> 5056.0
oh you missed the community but i

5054.88 --> 5060.96
thought you felt so

5056.0 --> 5060.96
much better lying to yourself

5061.679 --> 5068.56
yeah oh now oh so are you

5065.199 --> 5070.799999999999
regretting lying to yourself

5068.56 --> 5073.360000000001
actually see yeah i'm back to the globe

5070.8 --> 5077.92
i cannot think of a more repulsive

5073.36 --> 5080.32
[ __ ] thing anybody could do yeah

5077.92 --> 5081.92
i mean hey you're getting sick of all

5080.32 --> 5084.719
this nonsense you can't stop

5081.92 --> 5086.96
getting it out of your head i get that

5084.719 --> 5090.159
then you just walk away

5086.96 --> 5092.32
you don't go say oh i used to be a flat

5090.159 --> 5092.638999999999
earther but then i got stressed out and

5092.32 --> 5095.28
now

5092.639 --> 5095.96
i make glower again i cannot think of a

5095.28 --> 5113.84
more

5095.96 --> 5113.84
repulsive idiotic thing anybody could do

5114.4 --> 5120.48
i mean hey you want to get out of here

5117.44 --> 5122.239
you you don't want all this [ __ ] piling

5120.48 --> 5125.12
on to you you want to get out of

5122.239 --> 5125.44
your head all that i get that man i know

5125.12 --> 5128.08
you

5125.44 --> 5128.879999999999
have issues and not doing that to be

5128.08 --> 5130.96
mean

5128.88 --> 5132.8
not saying that to be mean you've proven

5130.96 --> 5135.84
that you have issues

5132.8 --> 5139.360000000001
step away just stop talking about it

5135.84 --> 5142.639
walk away right you don't

5139.36 --> 5146.0
lie to yourself literally

5142.639 --> 5148.159000000001
take the veil over your eyes again

5146.0 --> 5149.36
and start pretending like the globe is

5148.159 --> 5152.159
real

5149.36 --> 5152.96
that's like spiritually lobotomizing

5152.159 --> 5158.32
yourself i

5152.96 --> 5158.32
cannot believe you do that

5158.96 --> 5165.04
absolutely rip the [ __ ] off you piece of

5166.84 --> 5169.84
[ __ ]

5174.37 --> 5177.399
[Music]

5184.719 --> 5188.56
yeah i don't need you to tell me that

5188.639 --> 5194.88
yeah why don't you go

5192.4 --> 5196.32
and realize what you've done this sin

5194.88 --> 5199.28
you just committed

5196.32 --> 5200.5599999999995
yeah yeah jesus's love is not gonna

5199.28 --> 5204.96
forgive you

5200.56 --> 5211.04
for knowingly lying

5204.96 --> 5214.36
to yourself yeah

5211.04 --> 5218.56
it's not gonna happen you know you're

5214.36 --> 5219.5199999999995
lying yeah doesn't matter what the [ __ ]

5218.56 --> 5222.0
you pray to

5219.52 --> 5222.639
you're not gonna be forgiven when you

5222.0 --> 5227.36
know

5222.639 --> 5227.36
you're lying yeah

5227.6 --> 5233.360000000001
now if you didn't know if you had actual

5231.199 --> 5234.638999999999
doubts that you could prove to yourself

5233.36 --> 5237.679
make sense

5234.639 --> 5241.76
yeah then it's called a mistake but you

5237.679 --> 5245.6
know it's wrong that's lying

5241.76 --> 5248.4800000000005
it's a sin yeah

5245.6 --> 5252.8
jesus is not gonna forgive you for

5248.48 --> 5255.599999999999
knowingly lying

5252.8 --> 5267.84
especially to yourself i cannot think of

5255.6 --> 5267.84
a more atrocious act

5278.639 --> 5284.400000000001
aries wanna 100 i'm not even gonna ask i

5281.679 --> 5284.4
don't want to know

5284.639 --> 5295.84
maybe he did i don't care

5331.04 --> 5337.84
what did who say terror306

5339.92 --> 5343.04
yeah well dude

5343.76 --> 5348.84
you know what my primary inspiration is

5346.719 --> 5351.92
for life

5348.84 --> 5356.0
truth and don't lie

5351.92 --> 5360.0
no matter the cost yeah

5356.0 --> 5364.56
so your interpretation of

5360.0 --> 5367.679
being inspired by me is an atrocity

5364.56 --> 5370.56
when you already admitted that you lied

5367.679 --> 5370.56
to yourself

5370.8 --> 5379.84
i reject you

5387.04 --> 5393.84
is the real i don't know probably

5395.92 --> 5400.32
i don't think the real one has a wrench

5399.28 --> 5404.159
or anything

5400.32 --> 5404.159
i'll double check maybe he is just a

5404.84 --> 5407.84
bastard

5411.12 --> 5416.08
but i don't think so i vaguely remember

5417.6 --> 5421.84
misbehaving earlier and i did take

5423.04 --> 5435.84
french away where

5451.44 --> 5463.839999999999
it's probably him

5500.1 --> 5505.84
[Music]

5502.84 --> 5505.84
ah

5534.239 --> 5539.5199999999995
okay well rob h i guessed that by that

5536.8 --> 5539.52
standard then

5541.28 --> 5550.159
he didn't go into space

5546.32 --> 5552.4
but yeah i'm not gonna ask any glober

5550.159 --> 5554.239
again because they'll just convolute

5552.4 --> 5556.32
everything until you don't even know

5554.239 --> 5559.759999999999
what the [ __ ] going on anymore

5556.32 --> 5560.0
probably because they know conclusively

5559.76 --> 5564.719
that

5560.0 --> 5566.96
they have been lied to with this claim

5564.719 --> 5568.56
that supposedly virgin galactic went

5566.96 --> 5571.04
into space

5568.56 --> 5572.84
if the karman line is just arbitrarily

5571.04 --> 5574.639
assigned by the united states in

5572.84 --> 5579.52
contrast

5574.639 --> 5579.52
to another definition of it after hey

5583.12 --> 5589.44
[ __ ] there is no space space is fake

5587.52 --> 5592.320000000001
cannot exist it's a violation of the

5589.44 --> 5595.36
second law of thermodynamics

5592.32 --> 5595.759999999999
yeah it doesn't apply to atmosphere

5595.36 --> 5598.799999999999
because

5595.76 --> 5601.1990000000005
atmosphere is a fake model based

5598.8 --> 5604.400000000001
conception

5601.199 --> 5606.239
air however air

5604.4 --> 5607.44
gas pressure second law of

5606.239 --> 5610.48
thermodynamics

5607.44 --> 5612.159
definitely applies to that one yeah so

5610.48 --> 5617.839999999999
there is no outer space

5612.159 --> 5617.839999999999
because you're breathing air right now

5652.32 --> 5655.84
well a kumo virus it's because it's

5654.8 --> 5659.360000000001
[ __ ] it just

5655.84 --> 5661.52
draws in a conception of orbits

5659.36 --> 5663.44
with technicals it's all about

5661.52 --> 5663.84
engineering apparently that's what i got

5663.44 --> 5665.839999999999
from

5663.84 --> 5669.52
bob the science guy earlier before i

5665.84 --> 5669.52
banned him for being a scumbag

5670.0 --> 5675.36
she is he is a scum bag

5679.679 --> 5690.0
so are you

5687.52 --> 5692.400000000001
right but it doesn't actually influence

5690.0 --> 5692.4
anything

5696.639 --> 5705.28
like all of it is completely ridiculous

5700.08 --> 5705.28
like if if supposedly

5705.52 --> 5710.4800000000005
at a certain height the presupposed

5708.639 --> 5714.96
gravity would lessen

5710.48 --> 5717.36
a certain point and you wouldn't need

5714.96 --> 5719.84
anything to esca to have an escape

5717.36 --> 5722.48
velocity that makes no sense

5719.84 --> 5725.119000000001
because the escape velocity is

5722.48 --> 5727.119
supposedly all about the gravity

5725.119 --> 5728.5599999999995
so that means the higher up you go the

5727.119 --> 5732.0
less grip you have

5728.56 --> 5735.76
the easier it will be to transport

5732.0 --> 5740.4
weight supposedly of the device

5735.76 --> 5740.400000000001
to go up there and stay up there

5740.48 --> 5745.678999999999
but the whole idea from the line because

5744.08 --> 5749.199
of some escape philos that's

5745.679 --> 5752.56
[ __ ] because it doesn't happen

5749.199 --> 5753.599999999999
things go down it's rocket propelled

5752.56 --> 5756.4800000000005
right

5753.6 --> 5758.719
and the rocket stops after the karman

5756.48 --> 5761.599999999999
line

5758.719 --> 5763.84
that means it's not going to fall back

5761.6 --> 5763.84
down

5764.48 --> 5767.919999999999
because there's no gravity there to pull

5766.96 --> 5771.84
it back

5767.92 --> 5771.84
anymore supposedly

5791.52 --> 5794.080000000001
let's come

5795.199 --> 5799.839999999999
it's a lot get in chat

5801.36 --> 5808.0
to get banned they keep coming

5805.36 --> 5811.199
glober anti-flat earther i mean

5808.0 --> 5815.44
anti-flat earther community is out here

5811.199 --> 5819.119
all properly triggered over this

5815.44 --> 5820.4
foolishness claim somebody supposedly

5819.119 --> 5822.239
going to space

5820.4 --> 5824.638999999999
and all the technicals are all getting

5822.239 --> 5826.959999999999
screwed

5824.639 --> 5829.28
claims are being rearranged and it's a

5826.96 --> 5831.76
giant mess and you all know it

5829.28 --> 5832.96
like a bunch of cockroaches and and yeah

5831.76 --> 5837.04
the fridge just got

5832.96 --> 5837.04
lifted up you're all scouring

5837.6 --> 5841.84
what's happening right here

5880.84 --> 5883.84
um

5900.8 --> 5905.479
it's just a package

5902.4 --> 5905.478999999999
[Music]

5906.4 --> 5911.839999999999
i'm gonna watch this show again okay

5908.48 --> 5911.839999999999
good servant

5914.32 --> 5925.84
it's a messy show though i'm not in the

5917.679 --> 5925.84
best of moods

5932.719 --> 5939.199
i do appreciate however tom parker

5935.52 --> 5942.400000000001
having rejoined

5939.199 --> 5946.32
and not being mean or

5942.4 --> 5949.199
pissy about being banned the other day

5946.32 --> 5953.84
and also not pushing his [ __ ] back to

5949.199 --> 5953.839999999999
the front i really appreciate that

5960.159 --> 5964.08
this is getting messy you think good

5964.84 --> 5968.4800000000005
servant

5966.159 --> 5971.44
yes akumu virus i'm not gonna ban you

5968.48 --> 5974.638999999999
you're being a good boy i agree

5971.44 --> 5974.638999999999
no guarantee though

5975.199 --> 5982.08
because i still i still just

5980.0 --> 5983.52
don't like you dude i don't think i'll

5982.08 --> 5986.96
ever like you

5983.52 --> 5989.679
you annoy me a lot

5986.96 --> 5992.0
and you're very dishonest at times and i

5989.679 --> 5995.76
find that unacceptable

5992.0 --> 5998.0
but yeah for now at least you've been

5995.76 --> 6009.84
behaving in chat

5998.0 --> 6009.84
i appreciate that

6020.84 --> 6023.84
good

6038.639 --> 6045.52
all right i'm gonna round out the show

6041.92 --> 6045.52
in quite over the place

6049.76 --> 6054.159000000001
but yeah i thought at least it was an

6052.32 --> 6057.44
active show

6054.159 --> 6057.44
like that so

6057.6 --> 6062.0
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6060.48 --> 6066.0
liked this show and if you did

6062.0 --> 6068.08
they'll screw that pile on the downvotes

6066.0 --> 6069.679
let's let's get it to a billion down

6068.08 --> 6072.239
votes i don't care about that

6069.679 --> 6074.08
but if you liked it and please don't

6072.239 --> 6076.0
forget to rogan's it up

6074.08 --> 6078.0
and if you haven't already subscribe to

6076.0 --> 6080.239
my channel and hit the bell notification

6078.0 --> 6082.08
so you know when i'm going live which is

6080.239 --> 6084.239
normally 1 p.m amsterdam time in the

6082.08 --> 6085.119
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

6084.239 --> 6087.119
weekend

6085.119 --> 6089.36
please also do support me through the

6087.119 --> 6091.44
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

6089.36 --> 6094.159
and the membership system join button

6091.44 --> 6095.28
they'll be much appreciated any

6094.159 --> 6098.48
donations

6095.28 --> 6099.04
will be unconditional or i don't want

6098.48 --> 6102.0
them

6099.04 --> 6103.04
just on the record right because there

6102.0 --> 6107.44
have been people

6103.04 --> 6110.0
trying to make me say things before

6107.44 --> 6110.799999999999
i do not appreciate that i will never do

6110.0 --> 6113.52
that

6110.8 --> 6115.1990000000005
so the support that i require will have

6113.52 --> 6118.2390000000005
to be unconditional

6115.199 --> 6119.919999999999
but otherwise my entire setup

6118.239 --> 6121.36
everything that i do here will be

6119.92 --> 6124.8
compromised

6121.36 --> 6127.839999999999
and i will not do that right

6124.8 --> 6127.84
because i don't [ __ ]

6128.239 --> 6132.799999999999
right i will be back tomorrow flat earth

6130.239 --> 6135.199
early bird number 953

6132.8 --> 6136.8
on the tuesday and i'm going to join the

6135.199 --> 6139.44

6136.8 --> 6142.159000000001
just now started up the live show hope

6139.44 --> 6145.599999999999
