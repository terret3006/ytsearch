right I think I got you all anyway yeah

215.93 --> 229.719
good morning to you

217.9 --> 229.719
EMB what and seasonably cool yeah anyway

231.73 --> 240.07899999999998
had a very similar night as to yesterday

236.29 --> 241.879
went to bed incredibly early again

240.079 --> 244.579
before 12 I don't know what it is but I

241.879 --> 250.159
just want to go to bed early and then I

244.579 --> 253.06900000000002
I don't know what this is but it's kind

250.159 --> 257.03
of weird because since I'm doing that

253.069 --> 259.699
and then not really getting up in the

257.03 --> 260.15
morning too much because this here's the

259.699 --> 263.84000000000003
weird thing

260.15 --> 265.4
normally I yeah I feel don't feel really

263.84 --> 270.289
all that well in the mornings and this

265.4 --> 274.69
despite whatever kind of eating habits I

270.289 --> 277.88
have right so now I'm just kind of like

274.69 --> 279.889
trying to catch extra sleep but it's

277.88 --> 282.59
very it's like mental you know it my

279.889 --> 284.59000000000003
body is damn well rested and it's like

282.59 --> 290.17999999999995
yeah when are you gonna get out of bed

284.59 --> 292.96999999999997
but my mind is still like it has a lot

290.18 --> 295.34000000000003
to ponder on it always does and where I

292.97 --> 297.38000000000005
leave off the night when they start the

295.34 --> 300.919
morning up it comes back to me and then

297.38 --> 303.65
that is also part when I am for example

300.919 --> 305.57
up very late Y can get so flustered

303.65 --> 309.19899999999996
because I didn't have time to basically

305.57 --> 312.62
work through everything that's been

309.199 --> 314.27000000000004
sitting on me from the last day but I

312.62 --> 316.34000000000003
got a lot of room for that and the funny

314.27 --> 320.87
thing is that if when I do sleep in

316.34 --> 322.69899999999996
between it just I there's a lot of

320.87 --> 326.27
dreams happening I talked about

322.699 --> 330.40000000000003
yesterday to what today again and it's

326.27 --> 334.58
like I'm having a lot of dream activity

330.4 --> 336.38
and it's it's kind of interesting

334.58 --> 338.06
because I even get the feeling there are

336.38 --> 340.4
things being resolved in those dreams

338.06 --> 342.75
but I can't really explain it it's just

340.4 --> 345.21
this sensation and

342.75 --> 349.05
yeah what happens after that when I then

345.21 --> 352.44
get up it's like I'm rested three times

349.05 --> 353.01
as much even though I barely physically

352.44 --> 368.94
sleep

353.01 --> 372.42
it's anyway so it was plenty busy today

368.94 --> 374.01
yesterday of course with the show and

372.42 --> 376.11
the Flat Earth debates which were pretty

374.01 --> 378.69
good I had a lot of trouble getting away

376.11 --> 381.33000000000004
from it but I managed to like slip away

378.69 --> 384.18
in the after show when Nathan was just

381.33 --> 385.44
railing on ballers again and yeah he

384.18 --> 390.90000000000003
didn't like people getting in between

385.44 --> 392.73
that I know that by now but yeah I get

390.9 --> 399.47999999999996
that but it just went away and when I

392.73 --> 403.91900000000004
come back it was over but overall a good

399.48 --> 406.11
debate show it's like you know the

403.919 --> 408.24
debates sometimes have like this kind of

406.11 --> 409.77000000000004
dip where everybody's been like yeah

408.24 --> 411.99
nothing really huh

409.77 --> 414.12
or it's just it doesn't things down

411.99 --> 416.22
really excite us but more recently it

414.12 --> 419.93
seems like there's there's a lot of new

416.22 --> 419.93
energy you're rolling into the debates

421.52 --> 428.37
and yeah we have new baller players as

425.91 --> 432.91900000000004
well from the other side like beavis and

428.37 --> 432.919
butt-head Jackie and Edie

438.499 --> 443.59900000000005
all right so anyway let's see what you

440.789 --> 443.599
guys are talking about

449.53 --> 452.48999999999995
Hey

460.65 --> 464.08
okay you're in the in the same time zone

463.15 --> 466.88899999999995
as mine

464.08 --> 466.889
sure

489.44 --> 493.43
that triggered baller is very uptight

491.87 --> 495.88
which triggered baller are you talking

493.43 --> 495.88
about dank

507.95 --> 513.71
now I can't see the moon come Parker

510.14 --> 518.4499999999999
it's as I said it's so cloudy I can't

513.71 --> 519.32
even see the Sun not anywhere it's

518.45 --> 522.22
pretty big

519.32 --> 522.22
great clouds

533.34 --> 540.5300000000001
mmm events are bandit

559.959 --> 567.699
okay wdp 2020 good luck on that

579.51 --> 583.86
wait who are you talking to

589.04 --> 593.26
is there somebody in chat I'm not seeing

597.1 --> 602.48
me haba okay but he's a key Cobb is

600.92 --> 604.899
actually talking about the weather he's

602.48 --> 610.73
not trying to defend his ball right now

604.899 --> 615.11
I guess you guys are eager for the

610.73 --> 622.029
debates to start in a way I am too you

615.11 --> 622.029
know and a part of that also is because

623.079 --> 633.3199999999999
like again yes yeah I didn't mention

625.91 --> 634.9699999999999
this yet but yes they like I noticed

633.32 --> 636.47
something I hadn't even noticed it

634.97 --> 639.4100000000001
before even though it had been laying

636.47 --> 641.4490000000001
around for a half a day but like the

639.41 --> 644.06
newspapers that I was gonna spread it

641.449 --> 645.829
had like really shitty propaganda in

644.06 --> 648.8199999999999
there I I almost considered just

645.829 --> 652.01
chugging them all in the paper trash

648.82 --> 653.6
because I just I I don't even want to be

652.01 --> 658.91
associated with that type of news

653.6 --> 662.51
because it was BLM propaganda and bad

658.91 --> 665.389
news on how yeah I cuz it is very bad

662.51 --> 667.49
news on how now apparently in politics

665.389 --> 671.12
here locally the Utrecht politics is

667.49 --> 675.5600000000001
trying to push a no gas policy for

671.12 --> 677.269
climate change and it's a terrible but I

675.56 --> 680.329
don't think it has like fully been

677.269 --> 681.139
initiate yet because that's a disaster

680.329 --> 682.819
waiting to happen

681.139 --> 685.699
like they already have been trying that

682.819 --> 691.91
[ __ ] in Amsterdam and it is a disaster

685.699 --> 695.93
every step of the way it's just I don't

691.91 --> 698.449
know man I'm in my mind whether it is

695.93 --> 701.51
because I'm getting more upset about the

698.449 --> 706.3
[ __ ] just keep getting pushed forward

701.51 --> 708.319
and not leading anywhere good that I

706.3 --> 710.8389999999999
might be getting a little bit more

708.319 --> 714.26
extreme but I really feel like maybe we

710.839 --> 719.589
should just call people that push that

714.26 --> 723.55
[ __ ] economic terrorists because

719.589 --> 727.07
it is effectively economic terrorism

723.55 --> 731.54
trying to basically force industry in an

727.07 --> 735.2600000000001
unreasonable position damaging them

731.54 --> 738.38
pushing them burdening them more in ways

735.26 --> 741.68
yeah and it always turns out to become

738.38 --> 744.47
selective and yeah friend politics

741.68 --> 746.5999999999999
bigger industries knowing exactly what

744.47 --> 748.9100000000001
to do with that while the smaller ones

746.6 --> 755.75
are just like what the [ __ ] that's

748.91 --> 760.43
unreasonable which it is and I it's it

755.75 --> 762.38
gets my blood boil really bad so that

760.43 --> 771.079
was in the freaking newspaper had to

762.38 --> 774.11
spread right and another thing that I

771.079 --> 777.079
even didn't get debt to yes it was weird

774.11 --> 778.82
I remember wanting to say it and then I

777.079 --> 780.9799999999999
got dragged off into something else I

778.82 --> 784.5790000000001
think it is that I called Rasta at that

780.98 --> 787.49
point but that was this weird weird

784.579 --> 789.7399999999999
little moment I almost wish I could have

787.49 --> 791.54
recorded I should have recorded it I was

789.74 --> 793.82
just looking around in the Dutch

791.54 --> 800.99
television section you know like the

793.82 --> 804.589
online Dutch television system like 1 2

800.99 --> 808.07
3 and the rest of stuff and like I saw

804.589 --> 812.0290000000001
like ooh on one there is like a 5 min

808.07 --> 815.0
political party broadcast from the PVV

812.029 --> 817.399
which is like the right-wing party and

815.0 --> 821.3
everybody hates their mini media right

817.399 --> 822.829
so I was like okay well I have seen like

821.3 --> 825.1099999999999
advertisements for them before I know

822.829 --> 827.06
what it is typically like so I was like

825.11 --> 830.269
okay I'm curious like what is it gonna

827.06 --> 836.42
be so I'm like click let's go go right

830.269 --> 838.88
now click ok nothing happening click

836.42 --> 842.949
like but it's on right now

838.88 --> 847.48
why can't I go there click click click

842.949 --> 850.91
open a new window right main page again

847.48 --> 851.72
it's like oh this is playing like the

850.91 --> 853.01
real life right now

851.72 --> 857.48
you just can't

853.01 --> 859.61
see it not even that I really wanted to

857.48 --> 861.77
see that but it's just like yeah that's

859.61 --> 863.66
going on the television right now you

861.77 --> 867.76
can't see it because you can't click it

863.66 --> 867.76
we made it so that you can't click it

870.19 --> 878.0300000000001
that makes me feel a little pissed off

875.02 --> 881.03
not because I think that the PV fee is

878.03 --> 885.0699999999999
such a fantastical thing you know it's

881.03 --> 892.39
just that I feel like who the [ __ ] are

885.07 --> 897.5200000000001
you - just censor something like that

892.39 --> 897.52
politically censored the television

897.82 --> 905.0300000000001
because of whatever reason I think it is

900.94 --> 907.9100000000001
quite revolting and I'm sure absolutely

905.03 --> 909.53
sure that PVV members which I have no

907.91 --> 914.24
association with really I don't know

909.53 --> 915.62
anyone I really don't I wouldn't mind

914.24 --> 918.44
getting to know that what I don't think

915.62 --> 920.71
we work out great

918.44 --> 924.97
you know culture wise I'm not like that

920.71 --> 927.83
I'm kind of left way I met unhinged

924.97 --> 929.39
detached laughter you could say you know

927.83 --> 931.58
old-fashioned laughter that just

929.39 --> 933.62
couldn't yeah I'm not going along with

931.58 --> 937.1600000000001
this [ __ ] that's not what I thought I

933.62 --> 940.43
was being promised right and it's not

937.16 --> 942.38
really gonna match too much but yeah

940.43 --> 944.6899999999999
they're going to be an outrage over that

942.38 --> 946.34
like what the [ __ ] well I mean we're

944.69 --> 948.1700000000001
being censored again we're being

946.34 --> 950.99
sensitive and is happening all the time

948.17 --> 953.5699999999999
I know it is not because I'm so

950.99 --> 955.91
interested in the PvP but because every

953.57 --> 957.98
time they're brought up on television

955.91 --> 961.37
Dutch television in some way it's always

957.98 --> 963.74
the same shits like they're so terrible

961.37 --> 965.5
we're gonna spare you from hearing any

963.74 --> 967.64
of it by censoring you know and then

965.5 --> 973.06
yeah then you don't have to hear that

967.64 --> 973.06
and then everybody just does that it is

974.81 --> 987.0799999999999
very painful and again it's it's not

983.85 --> 990.69
even like the PVV is such a great thing

987.08 --> 994.86
it's just that the way they're treating

990.69 --> 997.7090000000001
people by doing that is offensive and

994.86 --> 1001.99
that damn cat again this is like the

997.709 --> 1001.9899999999999
third time this morning no kitty no

1005.74 --> 1020.63
Kitty Bad Kitty so yeah I had to bring

1016.19 --> 1022.8800000000001
it up for a moment it's because I'm not

1020.63 --> 1025.61
even that much into the insider thing

1022.88 --> 1028.429
and just like oh yeah like oh I got a

1025.61 --> 1032.4489999999998
subject know that I can be all about

1028.429 --> 1035.8700000000001
that no it just makes me sick

1032.449 --> 1039.98
literally it literally makes me sick

1035.87 --> 1041.6299999999999
that I had to see that that I had to

1039.98 --> 1045.89
once again be confronted with that

1041.63 --> 1049.19
that's going on in my country with with

1045.89 --> 1052.8700000000001
public utilities that are sponsored by

1049.19 --> 1058.1200000000001
taxpayer money and then that happens

1052.87 --> 1058.12
it's it shouldn't be like that guys

1066.36 --> 1089.9189999999999
right so that's just one little thing

1068.89 --> 1092.0700000000002
you know yeah nee nee nee stop getting a

1089.919 --> 1096.48
little obsessed

1092.07 --> 1096.48
it's a cat of course it

1110.96 --> 1115.55
or are you saying that I am a cat person

1113.36 --> 1118.84
but it's getting annoying when cats are

1115.55 --> 1124.37
constantly trying to make me do things

1118.84 --> 1126.8
so don't know why you're bringing up

1124.37 --> 1130.79
that to me you Cap'n don't know why it

1126.8 --> 1133.0
why you need to do that you know I'm a

happens

1165.84 --> 1172.1699999999998
all right Missouri bear yeah but that's

1167.91 --> 1175.47
look everything you could do they will

1172.17 --> 1178.8000000000002
use and then do it to something that

1175.47 --> 1181.77
actually doesn't deserve it so the more

1178.8 --> 1184.77
you hate on art the ugly part they will

1181.77 --> 1188.58
use as an excuse to destroy the good art

1184.77 --> 1191.43
on television and then say this is what

1188.58 --> 1193.62
you want right you want to burn art

1191.43 --> 1195.93
right here we're doing exactly what you

1193.62 --> 1199.26
want oh it was not the type of art you

1195.93 --> 1201.3
want to burn oh that's too bad because

1199.26 --> 1210.81
you told us to burn art so we're gonna

1201.3 --> 1213.5
burn this art how about that people this

1210.81 --> 1217.86
is the type of people we're dealing with

1213.5 --> 1221.82
you can't just spout out things like we

1217.86 --> 1222.4499999999998
should do this because they're not gonna

1221.82 --> 1225.27
do that

1222.45 --> 1228.0
no they are gonna use what you say and

1225.27 --> 1231.71
then do exactly the opposite and then

1228.0 --> 1231.71
try to pin it on you that's what they do

1232.04 --> 1238.02
you know you gotta literally be careful

1235.2 --> 1240.24
with what you say and I know it because

1238.02 --> 1243.03
I there sometimes things come out of my

1240.24 --> 1247.7
mouth not even like on my show and

1243.03 --> 1251.19
they're like that's it has consequences

1247.7 --> 1254.3700000000001
you gotta be careful with what you think

1251.19 --> 1256.74
and express because those thoughts and

1254.37 --> 1262.56
expressions will be extracted by the

1256.74 --> 1266.04
Machine and then used against you if you

1262.56 --> 1273.11
allow yourself to just do it and think

1266.04 --> 1273.11
there is no consequences to every action

1277.32 --> 1288.6
No so don't talk about burning art you

1284.91 --> 1290.8200000000002
know if things work out all right then

1288.6 --> 1293.6699999999998
it simply won't become anything worth

1290.82 --> 1296.01
anything by the way the whole modern art

1293.67 --> 1301.14
situation in there the whole expensive

1296.01 --> 1303.45
art nonsense it's just another currency

1301.14 --> 1309.1100000000001
really to most of these people they

1303.45 --> 1312.6000000000001
don't give a [ __ ] it's it's just a a

1309.11 --> 1316.9799999999998
trick to move around a lot of money has

1312.6 --> 1319.4299999999998
nothing to do with the actual art most

1339.58 --> 1343.119
really disgusting paintings and [ __ ] out

1341.529 --> 1348.389
there look if you got such a big problem

1343.119 --> 1350.049
with that right do something about it

1348.389 --> 1352.629
because if you're just gonna be

1350.049 --> 1356.769
blabbering about it on the internet all

1352.629 --> 1359.769
day long it's what I said he's gonna

1356.769 --> 1362.619
happen so you either shut the [ __ ] up

1359.769 --> 1365.499
and do something about it

1362.619 --> 1370.7189999999998
like go there and actually do that to

1365.499 --> 1372.519
that art that you hate so much or don't

1370.719 --> 1374.8590000000002
talk about destroying art because

1372.519 --> 1376.83
they're just gonna use it to destroy

1374.859 --> 1380.9689999999998
something that you do actually like

1376.83 --> 1380.9689999999998

their explanations for it you know

1413.19 --> 1423.0700000000002
all right Rasta yeah yeah that happened

1420.22 --> 1424.96
by the way that's right yesterday after

1423.07 --> 1429.46
the show after arrest I had was part of

1424.96 --> 1432.49
that show yeah a cop that rest actually

1429.46 --> 1437.32
recognized from the force right came by

1432.49 --> 1440.38
his house and was looking through his

1437.32 --> 1445.1499999999999
trash cans specifically and he saw it

1440.38 --> 1447.46
like from inside and he went out and

1445.15 --> 1450.91
just went to meet him and asked like

1447.46 --> 1455.65
what's he doing and yeah they apparently

1450.91 --> 1457.48
was looking for something right and

1455.65 --> 1460.8700000000001
there's there was like an alley right

1457.48 --> 1462.16
next to Rasta with bigger trash yeah

1460.87 --> 1464.26
what is it

1462.16 --> 1467.95
trash containers no that no but the cop

1464.26 --> 1473.71
only looked through Rasta hats houses

1467.95 --> 1478.42
trash cans and then went away yeah that

1473.71 --> 1480.19
was weird in that crazy situation over

1478.42 --> 1481.99
there that's by the way grown completely

1480.19 --> 1484.45
out of control I don't know

1481.99 --> 1486.91
I'm surprised that I haven't bumped into

1484.45 --> 1489.94
it like through Infowars yet but it they

1486.91 --> 1492.94
brought in the National Guard in that

1489.94 --> 1495.0700000000002
town over there and they still haven't

1492.94 --> 1498.42
find the supposed guy that seems to be

1495.07 --> 1498.4199999999998
changing in size now too

1500.74 --> 1504.73
yeah I don't know if anybody else has

1502.779 --> 1508.36
picked up on that situation in his town

1504.73 --> 1510.8700000000001
but it's like going nuts still right to

1508.36 --> 1510.87
this moment

1514.87 --> 1518.08
[Music]

1525.11 --> 1529.99
yeah that's right Guns of Navarone RFP

1527.42 --> 1534.89
that's exactly what I was trying to say

1529.99 --> 1539.44
so if you get all hung up it's the same

1534.89 --> 1542.6000000000001
effect as like that the the baseline

1539.44 --> 1549.8300000000002
right wing versus left-wing political

1542.6 --> 1552.6499999999999
view approach or the the info wars and

1549.83 --> 1556.1899999999998
trumpian situation versus the deep state

1552.65 --> 1561.14
er globalists kind it's like yeah that

1556.19 --> 1565.43
type of ikana iconography those type of

1561.14 --> 1568.1000000000001
base narratives they pull people in to

1565.43 --> 1572.03
start basically take on the stories from

1568.1 --> 1574.61
one side and then imagine that that is

1572.03 --> 1579.67
somehow effective against the other

1574.61 --> 1579.6699999999998
virtual side it's not

1586.71 --> 1596.16
although yad may help to get your stress

1589.59 --> 1597.8999999999999
off your chest about it maybe alright

1596.16 --> 1599.76
cuz the only thing that really helps is

1597.9 --> 1602.16
figuring out what is really going on

1599.76 --> 1604.32
what's the real damage who's going to be

1602.16 --> 1609.45
paying for that who's gonna feel the

1604.32 --> 1612.36
real pressure and then somehow breaking

1609.45 --> 1614.1000000000001
it open as a complete contrast to any

1612.36 --> 1615.36
kind of representation of reality that

1614.1 --> 1618.84
we're all going to be shown on

1615.36 --> 1622.4099999999999
television and then show the real

1618.84 --> 1623.82
picture the raw exposed real situation

1622.41 --> 1627.1100000000001
in some way but it's kind of dangerous

1623.82 --> 1627.11
it could be dangerous

1627.74 --> 1634.95
they will at least harass you after that

1631.1 --> 1638.49
for in something like that if you're

1634.95 --> 1641.16
just gonna take their story and then get

1638.49 --> 1645.74
outraged over elements to their story

1641.16 --> 1645.74
then you become part of their story

1658.07 --> 1665.36
largest globalist in North weren't god I

1661.37 --> 1667.9599999999998
don't think so you have a yeah I don't

1665.36 --> 1667.9599999999998
think so

1677.45 --> 1680.559
[Music]

1682.39 --> 1688.8100000000002
but a a sock worn on the globalist hand

1686.86 --> 1690.9599999999998
that's that's a hilarious metaphor I

1688.81 --> 1694.45
don't think it's really like that though

1690.96 --> 1696.67
but yet Trump is basically the corporate

1694.45 --> 1704.98
representative of the United States

1696.67 --> 1708.01
Empire that's effectively what that is

1704.98 --> 1711.1
but he does he can still do things but

1708.01 --> 1713.02
as to what he thinks and feels I don't

1711.1 --> 1719.1699999999998
think he has a lot of respect for like

1713.02 --> 1721.57
the globe at NASA and all that like he

1719.17 --> 1725.02
may think there's something good there

1721.57 --> 1732.21
still possible but at least he is

1725.02 --> 1735.49
publicly annoyed by the blatant failures

1732.21 --> 1737.5
because NASA isn't really doing much and

1735.49 --> 1739.21
they keep postponing every and now

1737.5 --> 1741.16
that's part of their system of course

1739.21 --> 1744.88
but like Trump doesn't like that so

1741.16 --> 1747.6100000000001
whether he doesn't like it because he

1744.88 --> 1749.5
believes it could be real and he's just

1747.61 --> 1752.34
like this is costing too much money and

1749.5 --> 1755.11
just pragmatic about it or whether he

1752.34 --> 1757.99
knows it's all [ __ ] and he's just

1755.11 --> 1763.12
trolling them it could be either but

1757.99 --> 1766.0
however you're gonna view what he thinks

1763.12 --> 1769.4199999999998
and says about it I'm pretty sure he

1766.0 --> 1772.03
doesn't have a lot of respect for that

1769.42 --> 1775.74
for yeah at least who's running that

1772.03 --> 1775.74
program overall

1786.95 --> 1793.04
Missouri bear come on you can't be

1790.86 --> 1797.1
serious

1793.04 --> 1801.69
there's plenty art out there but yeah

1797.1 --> 1804.4099999999999
when the art is being moved around and

1801.69 --> 1807.24
shown everyone through lots of money

1804.41 --> 1809.3100000000002
yeah that's got it it's not gonna be

1807.24 --> 1812.8700000000001
about art it's gonna be about what is

1809.31 --> 1816.78
the arts specifically designated to do

1812.87 --> 1820.08
through the money you know but that's

1816.78 --> 1822.51
not the majority of art there's a lot of

1820.08 --> 1826.79
art being made by people on a daily

1822.51 --> 1829.59
basis and some of it is really good and

1826.79 --> 1833.19
yeah one of the places you can even like

1829.59 --> 1836.37
find that is that over at big bears no

1833.19 --> 1839.0
you're not getting it because they're

1836.37 --> 1842.37
people just send him stuff they make

1839.0 --> 1845.85
that is art that's the real art art is

1842.37 --> 1849.06
not what is being pedestal around by

1845.85 --> 1854.2199999999998
bankers to show off with what they

1849.06 --> 1857.82
declare is art you know art by consensus

1854.22 --> 1860.34
that's not how it works so they like to

1857.82 --> 1862.49
think make you think that it works that

1860.34 --> 1862.49
way

1883.78 --> 1889.23
right yeah deviantART has been around

1886.15 --> 1889.23
for a long time

1912.05 --> 1918.1399999999999
come on Missouri bear can I get some

1914.3 --> 1919.79
feedback to what I just said because get

1918.14 --> 1921.95
the feeling you're squirting a little

1919.79 --> 1923.29
you're like trying to pull things out of

1921.95 --> 1927.8
proportion

1923.29 --> 1932.33
you know don't don't make your entire

1927.8 --> 1936.08
worldview based purely on everything

1932.33 --> 1939.05
that they present to us you shouldn't do

1936.08 --> 1940.9399999999998
that first thing you should learn is to

1939.05 --> 1943.6399999999999
step away but that means the way really

1940.94 --> 1945.95
step away you find something else first

1943.64 --> 1950.5900000000001
don't get hung up on their lies

1945.95 --> 1950.5900000000001
don't make your entire world their lies

1952.3 --> 1957.82
there's so much more better

1995.759 --> 2005.07
hmm right yeah I think you're right guns

2002.159 --> 2009.3300000000002
of never run you know it is a long-term

2005.07 --> 2013.889
plan that's just a that's I guess is all

2009.33 --> 2016.499
based on tested things of which like

2013.889 --> 2020.58
there is no real oversight over at all

2016.499 --> 2024.739
because how it was established to be

2020.58 --> 2029.879
formed this plan that's kind of been

2024.739 --> 2033.049
erased in the in the rearranging of yeah

2029.879 --> 2033.049
history and knowledge

2038.64 --> 2046.19
but I think yeah your it is a very very

2042.299 --> 2049.109
long-term plan but it's not really a

2046.19 --> 2051.0
what is it an individual action based

2049.109 --> 2053.669
plan it's just a it's based on

2051.0 --> 2056.85
directions it's based on how culture

2053.669 --> 2062.879
moves how it can be nudged that's how

2056.85 --> 2064.7999999999997
it's all design it's like a system where

2062.879 --> 2068.129
there's just a lot of games being played

2064.8 --> 2073.57
with humanity whatever it's whatever it

2068.129 --> 2076.749
is at the time that's how it's designed

yeah amanda is spelled with an H at the

2144.059 --> 2147.8590000000004
end people and get it right

2174.37 --> 2183.46
you do we have a huh I don't like art

2180.55 --> 2187.96
can be like really absurdly interesting

2183.46 --> 2190.93
as long as you can just keep the

2187.96 --> 2193.42
nonsense talk from the general public or

2190.93 --> 2194.0699999999997
the museum curator or whatever out of

2193.42 --> 2197.16
the way

2194.07 --> 2200.53
like it's great to just go in a museum

2197.16 --> 2204.16
like with a person and then one-on-one

2200.53 --> 2206.17
like open up your mind and really try to

2204.16 --> 2208.8399999999997
figure out like what's going on here

2206.17 --> 2212.86
what was in the mind of the person what

2208.84 --> 2216.7000000000003
are they Priyanka like really analyze

2212.86 --> 2218.7400000000002
the art to we'll find the tale yeah it

2216.7 --> 2221.29
can be interesting if the atmosphere is

2218.74 --> 2223.9599999999996
good you know if if the artist is

2221.29 --> 2227.23
typically just trying to cause

2223.96 --> 2230.77
controversy or that kind of nonsense

2227.23 --> 2237.1
yeah then it's that's annoying and it's

2230.77 --> 2240.09
with a lot of modern art fifty pictures

2237.1 --> 2244.75
on the wall no but that's not a problem

2240.09 --> 2247.27
you don't have to look at it all you

2244.75 --> 2249.58
have control over where your eyes wonder

2247.27 --> 2252.96
if you see something you don't like you

2249.58 --> 2252.96
forget about it and move on

2256.62 --> 2261.31
you know if I mean some art gallery and

2259.75 --> 2264.1
there's like these old master paintings

2261.31 --> 2266.56
it's awesome and then I walk like to the

2264.1 --> 2268.96
next hall and it looks like modern art

2266.56 --> 2271.5099999999998
Oh simple I'm just not gonna go there

2268.96 --> 2276.9
I'm gonna go back see if there's more of

2271.51 --> 2276.9
the good stuff no it's not that hard

2290.26 --> 2299.579
[Music]

2306.01 --> 2309.1890000000003
[Music]

2312.88 --> 2316.139
[Music]

2318.07 --> 2321.06
what would one

2328.46 --> 2331.27
oh right

2331.88 --> 2339.35
well why is that strange hm it's just

2335.18 --> 2342.02
people bringing it up if it's brought up

2339.35 --> 2344.47
if it's right now their situation being

2342.02 --> 2347.89
presented in the media concerning art

2344.47 --> 2350.2099999999996
that is like trying to agitate people or

2347.89 --> 2353.18
yeah of course it's gonna be brought up

2350.21 --> 2356.62
by a handful of people so it's not

2353.18 --> 2356.62
strange that it's being brought up

2365.78 --> 2371.75
okay I think you're talking about

2367.76 --> 2374.6800000000003
Rembrandt you have a yeah it's the most

2371.75 --> 2380.27
famous one he made the the Night Watch

2374.68 --> 2382.81
now van Gogh is not van Gogh goes from

2380.27 --> 2382.81
the 20th century

2396.49 --> 2400.9689999999996
[Music]

2412.75 --> 2423.13
17th century van Gogh from the 17th

2419.33 --> 2423.13
century I don't think so

2436.33 --> 2445.5299999999997
right yeah it's a big difference there

2447.54 --> 2456.27
now but Rembrandt was from yeah from the

2453.22 --> 2458.9199999999996
time where the the Dutch

2456.27 --> 2461.89
yeah the Netherlands really became a

2458.92 --> 2467.85
thing so that's going to be

2461.89 --> 2467.85
yeah 17th century or 80 now 17th century

2485.21 --> 2500.66
right anyway I like Rembrandt style

2494.569 --> 2502.88
because he his light play he plays with

2500.66 --> 2505.79
light and color contrasts in a really

2502.88 --> 2512.809
elegant manner and I really appreciate

2505.79 --> 2517.16
that it is like the you know in a very

2512.809 --> 2522.9700000000003
careful way the classic arts being

2517.16 --> 2527.93
reinvented like he really figured out

2522.97 --> 2530.2999999999997
like how to be classical and theatrical

2527.93 --> 2532.3089999999997
and it did that's why it really did

2530.3 --> 2537.6400000000003
those paintings that he made really gave

2532.309 --> 2540.5
me the feeling like similar to like old

2537.64 --> 2544.339
Greek style mythology statues and all

2540.5 --> 2547.089
that oh my god that can't you know get

2544.339 --> 2547.089
away

2551.89 --> 2562.2799999999997
this creature really yeah but yeah he

2558.91 --> 2564.71
like what the old Greek mythology's and

2562.28 --> 2567.26
all that do and the old statues they

2564.71 --> 2571.819
really put down like the atmosphere of

2567.26 --> 2575.15
that of the old legends and with the

2571.819 --> 2577.22
Pantheon and all that and in a similar

2575.15 --> 2579.559
manner I thought that Rembrandt

2577.22 --> 2583.7
especially with the Night Watch but more

2579.559 --> 2588.9500000000003
paintings really put down like the like

2583.7 --> 2592.609
that the legend of that time of what was

2588.95 --> 2594.47
going on of the Netherlands and the

2592.609 --> 2596.96
people that were ruling it and what

2594.47 --> 2599.24
everybody was facing and the poverty -

2596.96 --> 2601.7200000000003
and all that and like oh yeah yeah I'm

2599.24 --> 2604.45
staying yeah yeah that's another one

2601.72 --> 2606.6
yeah he's more into like chaotic

2604.45 --> 2611.0699999999997
households and all that

2606.6 --> 2613.2599999999998
which happened to but yeah they really

2611.07 --> 2616.3700000000003
they put I thought ramrod really put

2613.26 --> 2619.8300000000004
down like the legendary feel of that age

2616.37 --> 2623.81
really well with his arts and that's

2619.83 --> 2623.81
probably why he is so appreciated

2628.43 --> 2633.48
suggesting photographic capturing before

2631.14 --> 2637.14
painting a card you may be onto

2633.48 --> 2642.09
something Adam they might have used like

2637.14 --> 2644.5499999999997
camera obscura thingies that were like

2642.09 --> 2647.3700000000003
guild secrets among painters I'm pretty

2644.55 --> 2651.98
sure that was the case because pillar

2647.37 --> 2654.7799999999997
painters have been gilded right that's

2651.98 --> 2657.09
where it came from the painters had

2654.78 --> 2660.3
guilds they were poor but they had a

2657.09 --> 2662.46
guild system because they had tricks

2660.3 --> 2664.8300000000004
they had painters knowledge and [ __ ] and

2662.46 --> 2667.86
I'm sure that this camera obscura thing

2664.83 --> 2676.17
was probably in there since Leonardo da

2667.86 --> 2679.1400000000003
Vinci times right or before even so yeah

2676.17 --> 2682.62
them is like this poor painter shitty

2679.14 --> 2685.1099999999997
people very poor painting great

2682.62 --> 2686.94
paintings and having this box that

2685.11 --> 2690.3900000000003
nobody really knew what that did

2686.94 --> 2692.07
somewhere in a closet that they would

2690.39 --> 2694.74
get out like when nobody was looking

2692.07 --> 2697.26
like okay let's get this they probably

2694.74 --> 2699.0
wouldn't even the people that they were

2697.26 --> 2700.6800000000003
photographing with that they would

2699.0 --> 2703.44
probably he didn't even tell them what

2700.68 --> 2706.83
it was I just told another just hold

2703.44 --> 2708.66
still like like it's all about my eyes

2706.83 --> 2711.09
not about that little box that's making

2708.66 --> 2713.22
a picture that I'm gonna use afterward

2711.09 --> 2716.58
to perfect it they could have done that

2713.22 --> 2719.6899999999996
you know I can easily imagine that that

2716.58 --> 2719.69
was going on back then

2722.94 --> 2726.9900000000002
the overlay method ranked

2745.21 --> 2751.4700000000003
Wow really Turin Shroud that's

2748.66 --> 2751.47
fascinating

2755.75 --> 2759.49
who knows could be

2767.21 --> 2769.7
mm-hmm it's funny that that was brought

2769.13 --> 2772.81
up

2769.7 --> 2772.81
[Music]

2780.869 --> 2786.289
all right so yeah when you look at it

2782.88 --> 2790.589
like that then the old masters were like

2786.289 --> 2794.369
using photography assistants in a very

2790.589 --> 2799.0389999999998
basic and secretive way they were simply

2794.369 --> 2800.9100000000003
using photography to add to the

2799.039 --> 2804.96
three-dimensional perfection of their

2800.91 --> 2808.259
painting arts and hey they did a great

2804.96 --> 2813.21
job is anybody complaining you know no

2808.259 --> 2814.71
their revered and even nowadays if you

2813.21 --> 2816.9
would actually use photographic

2814.71 --> 2819.119
assistants with a lot which a lot of

2816.9 --> 2821.099
painters and artists do by the way

2819.119 --> 2823.469
yeah there's kind of some good stuff

2821.099 --> 2833.21
coming out there so yeah they were just

2823.469 --> 2836.36
very very early with it no caps a DM

2833.21 --> 2836.36
[Music]

2840.26 --> 2844.73
I yeah no problem and you know thank you

2842.93 --> 2846.83
for the $5 to pitch a donation

2844.73 --> 2849.109
you know you've been bit very busy

2846.83 --> 2851.3199999999997
lately didn't forget you I know you

2849.109 --> 2851.3199999999997
don't

2853.22 --> 2856.2999999999997
[Music]

2863.21 --> 2868.309
[Music]

2884.4 --> 2893.4500000000003
I wonder what is hidden behind the

2886.589 --> 2897.18
Rembrandt dark color no but other

2893.45 --> 2898.259
paintings no but there might be things

2897.18 --> 2901.95
covered up in there

2898.259 --> 2904.079
that is correct there was like look you

2901.95 --> 2908.2189999999996
got to realize that these big paintings

2904.079 --> 2910.65
especially right they were propaganda

2908.219 --> 2911.64
art in a way as well so think about it

2910.65 --> 2914.579
like this okay

2911.64 --> 2917.8489999999997
in the time of the Soviet Union it's

2914.579 --> 2919.9500000000003
none that was photography and like

2917.849 --> 2923.279
remember all the photographs with Stalin

2919.95 --> 2925.43
then he literally would edit it out but

2923.279 --> 2928.279
the people that the were excommunicated

2925.43 --> 2932.069
executed bla he would just edit them out

2928.279 --> 2935.64
right so consider this these big

2932.069 --> 2938.0389999999998
paintings were basically state paintings

2935.64 --> 2940.859
they were a representative of the power

2938.039 --> 2942.2990000000004
that's how those big paintings were used

2940.859 --> 2944.13
and that's why they were paid all that

2942.299 --> 2946.67
money because they were basically

2944.13 --> 2950.4790000000003
propaganda tools so it's not

2946.67 --> 2953.15
inconceivable that because of that

2950.479 --> 2955.4399999999996
situations politically what happened

2953.15 --> 2958.829
certain paintings would suddenly be like

2955.44 --> 2960.469
okay this guy freakin betrayed the king

2958.829 --> 2963.3900000000003
or something so it's like painting

2960.469 --> 2966.539
either destroyed or it would be put in

2963.39 --> 2968.1299999999997
the back on hold or if they're part of

2966.539 --> 2971.5490000000004
some bigger picture and then would go

2968.13 --> 2973.8900000000003
like really bad with that individual for

2971.549 --> 2975.9
the state they would basically order

2973.89 --> 2979.0789999999997
like yeah you got to paint him out of it

2975.9 --> 2982.92
do it get him ready get rid of him so

2979.079 --> 2987.9300000000003
very likely that sort something like

2982.92 --> 2989.9990000000003
that could have happened here there well

2987.93 --> 2993.989
Tom Parker it's not that difficult

2989.999 --> 2997.3799999999997
because I've studied arts like four

2993.989 --> 3001.309
times and I literally had it in my exam

2997.38 --> 3005.69
I studied my middle school on arts as

3001.309 --> 3011.059
well physics math English Dutch biology

3005.69 --> 3015.759
and art and like my parents took me to

3011.059 --> 3025.6090000000004
museums a lot at a certain time

3015.759 --> 3029.23
so yeah I am know plenty but like art

3025.609 --> 3032.359
history man I've had that so many times

3029.23 --> 3035.72
it is something was brought up like the

3032.359 --> 3040.13
the names of the the architectural

3035.72 --> 3042.3799999999997
elements of like Roman building or the

3040.13 --> 3044.9900000000002
Greek buildings and so I could even

3042.38 --> 3046.6400000000003
roughly remember the names of like the

3044.99 --> 3048.859
architecture pieces because I've just

3046.64 --> 3052.64
memorized it like four or five times

3048.859 --> 3054.5
over my life you know when you get

3052.64 --> 3058.64
confronted enough eventually it really

3054.5 --> 3060.799
sticks so but I'm pretty sure that

3058.64 --> 3062.3489999999997
paintings were used like this it's

3060.799 --> 3066.349
logical

3062.349 --> 3069.289
like why else would you would you use

3066.349 --> 3071.48
all that just for vanity alone when you

3069.289 --> 3075.6800000000003
could use it for more than just vanity

3071.48 --> 3077.93
of course you would like I don't think

3075.68 --> 3081.74
at any age you really even control it

3077.93 --> 3084.95
had actual money to waste like that

3081.74 --> 3089.269
especially Dutch by the way right so we

3084.95 --> 3090.8289999999997
revered for not wasting money so if yeah

3089.269 --> 3095.2889999999998
if arts are gonna be paid for they're

3090.829 --> 3095.289
gonna have a function must be

3102.55 --> 3111.0600000000004
a Dutchman that doesn't know art is like

3108.61 --> 3115.4500000000003
an American that doesn't know firearms I

3111.06 --> 3121.87
don't know I don't know I think that art

3115.45 --> 3124.1499999999996
is it is considered as a quality among

3121.87 --> 3127.02
Dutch people on average they did kind of

3124.15 --> 3129.88
like keep that on the front line so yeah

3127.02 --> 3133.3
but to compare it to

3129.88 --> 3135.46
knowing guns I don't know it's a bit of

3133.3 --> 3137.94
a leap but I get your point

3135.46 --> 3137.94
thank

3147.109 --> 3155.299
right righty haba well I explained to

3150.619 --> 3157.5190000000002
you exactly why an artist is a performer

3155.299 --> 3158.69
he does something for somebody else and

3157.519 --> 3161.4199999999996
if there's going to be big money

3158.69 --> 3164.049
involved the big money is not because

3161.42 --> 3166.67
the artist is so expensive it is because

3164.049 --> 3168.739
what is going to be making is going to

3166.67 --> 3172.039
have a function that's worth paying that

3168.739 --> 3181.13
money for that's how it really works in

3172.039 --> 3183.829
my opinion you know the patron wants

3181.13 --> 3186.9500000000003
something out of it that's why you're

3183.829 --> 3189.319
putting down that money all right

3186.95 --> 3190.549
anyway I'm gonna round out the show cuz

3189.319 --> 3194.329
the flat earth debates are about to
