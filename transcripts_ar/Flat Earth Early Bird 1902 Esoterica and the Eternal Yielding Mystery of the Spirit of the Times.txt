great right weather today is really

107.799 --> 114.56
mixed one moment it's kind of nice and

110.28 --> 117.799
sunny the other moment well like 15

114.56 --> 120.36
minutes ago literally hail came

117.799 --> 124.68
down so it's like

120.36 --> 124.68
typical Springtime chaotic

125.719 --> 132.119
weather right now yeah there's big

129.28 --> 132.119
clouds flying

132.12 --> 140.44
over also just pieces of Clear Blue Sky

137.239 --> 142.48000000000002
in between and it's just changing around

140.44 --> 145.4
all the time

142.48 --> 147.64
now but yeah there was literally hail

145.4 --> 151.84
falling a little bit

147.64 --> 151.83999999999997
earlier that was weird

154.66 --> 160.64
[Music]

157.64 --> 160.64
H

162.599 --> 168.319
right it is Saturday the 23rd of March

170.21 --> 173.529
[Music]

174.33 --> 181.84
[Applause]

175.56 --> 181.84
2024 temperature is 8° C

187.879 --> 190.879
okay

191.36 --> 200.519
right it's not super warm or anything

196.28 --> 200.519
but oh there there it goes

208.76 --> 211.76
son

211.92 --> 215.879
I'm coming through a little Clear Spot

218.01 --> 222.319
[Music]

220.28 --> 225.68
there

222.319 --> 228.07999999999998
right hello Richard first in chat good

225.68 --> 228.08
to see

238.72 --> 241.72
you

260.959 --> 263.199
all

268.72 --> 271.72
right

273.52 --> 277.44
right so I got a title don't know if I'm

275.56 --> 279.44
really going to talk about it a lot but

277.44 --> 282.12
that's the title I had in

279.44 --> 286.0
mind

282.12 --> 289.32
esoterica although I don't like the word

286.0 --> 291.759
esoterica it's like wrong to

289.32 --> 296.28
me I like

291.759 --> 299.08000000000004
esoterics just CS but that's apparently

296.28 --> 300.44
not the right word for it it's kind of

299.08 --> 304.96
weird

300.44 --> 304.96
oh what's this chat acting weird

308.88 --> 311.88
again

315.4 --> 322.71999999999997
huh all right hello clutch good to see

320.039 --> 325.88
you right so esoterica and the Eternal

322.72 --> 328.8
yearling mystery the spirit of the

325.88 --> 333.199
times I'm getting these types of ideas

328.8 --> 335.56
from just watching Jordan Maxwell

333.199 --> 338.68
streams like older

335.56 --> 341.4
streams including about the mysteries of

338.68 --> 344.199
the structures on Mars which is

341.4 --> 347.59999999999997
hilarious watching that

344.199 --> 351.52000000000004
back but I mean like Jordan Maxwell

347.6 --> 353.56
talks a lot about symbols and esoterics

351.52 --> 356.79999999999995
or

353.56 --> 361.639
esoterica and it has been quite

356.8 --> 365.24
inspiring to just talk about that

361.639 --> 368.52
different a title before I start yeah

365.24 --> 373.599
well sometimes I think of a

368.52 --> 373.599
title the night before and sometimes I

375.16 --> 382.12
don't I had a title two days

378.639 --> 383.40000000000003
ago with my 1900 episode that title was

382.12 --> 387.479
there from the

383.4 --> 390.08
start you you know this you can check

387.479 --> 391.0
it through

390.08 --> 394.84
uh

391.0 --> 394.84
the Twitter X

396.68 --> 405.68
posts yeah hello a man go good to see

400.52 --> 410.19899999999996
you yep you got a wrench that's

405.68 --> 410.199
right we'll see how that

411.96 --> 417.23999999999995
fares must have missed that

418.319 --> 423.44
probably right but usually I don't

421.4 --> 425.84
really have a title before I start the

423.44 --> 427.919
show but sometimes I just do because I

425.84 --> 430.4
just have an idea sometimes I have a

427.919 --> 432.4
title and then like I end up not talking

430.4 --> 434.08
about it the entire

432.4 --> 436.87899999999996
show

434.08 --> 440.4
so it's kind of random like

436.879 --> 444.56
that I'm pretty much happy that I can

440.4 --> 448.52
figure out a title every show now just

444.56 --> 450.039
look at the early bird up to like

448.52 --> 453.15999999999997
episode

450.039 --> 455.31899999999996
1500 and most shows don't have a title

453.16 --> 455.319
at

459.28 --> 462.52
all all

475.039 --> 481.44
right yeah

478.44 --> 481.44
no

483.639 --> 488.56
all

484.8 --> 490.479
right fet [ __ ] going on

488.56 --> 493.8
whatever sure I'm going to end up

490.479 --> 495.12
Banning him for wasting everybody's time

493.8 --> 498.40000000000003
but uh

495.12 --> 502.039
yeah I was just discussing yesterday or

498.4 --> 503.44
rather I came up with an idea an insight

502.039 --> 506.199
about

503.44 --> 511.44
esoterics and

506.199 --> 511.44
how how they yield information

512.0 --> 518.76
continually but that like it is very

515.519 --> 520.279
likely that the more time passes even

518.76 --> 523.959
though the

520.279 --> 527.8
esoterics stay within the symbolism and

523.959 --> 531.4799999999999
people into the future can

527.8 --> 534.5999999999999
literally regard it and discover like

531.48 --> 537.16
there is esoterics to this and then

534.6 --> 540.16
divulge all kinds of

537.16 --> 544.7199999999999
insights based on their understanding

540.16 --> 548.64
and their connectivity with the

544.72 --> 550.0790000000001
esoterics there is a thing a pattern and

548.64 --> 552.6
that is

550.079 --> 556.3599999999999
that

552.6 --> 561.48
esoterics change over

556.36 --> 565.48
time it's yeah that's why I gave it a a

561.48 --> 568.64
separate a separate thing the spirit of

565.48 --> 570.6
the times which is not uh Rudolph

568.64 --> 573.04
Steiner based it's not part of spirit

570.6 --> 575.16
mechanics it's literally the spirit of

573.04 --> 578.5999999999999
the

575.16 --> 581.8
times like the the general colloquial

578.6 --> 585.0
saying the English

581.8 --> 587.279
saying that where everybody's mind is at

585.0 --> 590.64
in a period of time what they typically

587.279 --> 590.64
spend their time thinking

591.04 --> 597.36
about and so when people in a certain

596.079 --> 600.16
time

597.36 --> 603.0
frame get confronted with

600.16 --> 607.56
esoterics they will associate they will

603.0 --> 611.92
be reminded as it were of

607.56 --> 615.8389999999999
esoteric insights that

611.92 --> 615.8389999999999
reflect the spirit of the

615.959 --> 623.4399999999999
times but that also means that esoterics

620.079 --> 626.2399999999999
from very old ancient

623.44 --> 629.32
things will be interpreted through the

626.24 --> 633.279
lens of the spirit of the times and all

629.32 --> 635.5600000000001
older esoteric insights that would have

633.279 --> 640.399
back then say thousands of years ago

635.56 --> 642.2399999999999
been totally normal and logical and like

640.399 --> 644.399
yeah of course it means that like

642.24 --> 647.6
everybody understands that

644.399 --> 650.68
right those types of me

647.6 --> 654.0400000000001
insights would have been stuck to the

650.68 --> 657.4799999999999
spirit of those times and those specific

654.04 --> 660.56
meanings are likely to be lost

657.48 --> 663.399
forever and the period of the times of

660.56 --> 666.8
the current age

663.399 --> 670.2
reinterpreting esoterics from the past

666.8 --> 673.4799999999999
will yeah will also lead to the

670.2 --> 677.72
effective unintended covering

673.48 --> 682.519
up of those very specific assumed to be

677.72 --> 682.519
normal esoteric insights of those

682.6 --> 688.76
times it's an

685.24 --> 691.12
accidental reinterpretation reimagining

688.76 --> 693.92
of as

691.12 --> 696.639
esoterics it's just the realization I

693.92 --> 698.88
got it's like yeah we're looking at that

696.639 --> 701.519
statue from Egypt to this and that and

698.88 --> 704.24
like oh yeah we think that that means

701.519 --> 707.76
this reflect that upon the writings that

704.24 --> 710.399
have been about it

707.76 --> 713.279
but what about those things that weren't

710.399 --> 715.519
written about what about the normal

713.279 --> 717.68
habit-based

715.519 --> 720.279
ways of going

717.68 --> 723.079
about that would Yi yield very specific

720.279 --> 726.04
type of esoteric

723.079 --> 731.0
understanding that's just lost in

726.04 --> 733.8
between so the further away we are from

731.0 --> 737.44
regarding a esoteric

733.8 --> 740.079
symbol or piece of art from the

737.44 --> 744.7600000000001
past the more it

740.079 --> 748.0
becomes hollowed out of the wider

744.76 --> 751.16
esoteric meanings and

748.0 --> 755.56
context but but here's the interesting

751.16 --> 761.399
things almost like plants in

755.56 --> 765.3599999999999
nature new esoteric meanings will

761.399 --> 768.68
emerge from old symbols based on the

765.36 --> 771.72
spirit of the times in the current age

768.68 --> 771.7199999999999
it's like they will

777.199 --> 781.4799999999999
transform so yeah very

782.12 --> 786.9590000000001
esoteric you have any questions please

784.6 --> 786.9590000000001
let me

796.48 --> 803.639
know the Cooper old radio show right

800.16 --> 805.92
well that's the esoterics of those times

803.639 --> 808.399
I don't even know anything about Bill

805.92 --> 812.0
Cooper and his radio show and all that

808.399 --> 812.0
because I never listen to

812.199 --> 819.4399999999999
those so I don't have that specific

815.72 --> 819.44
palette available to

821.6 --> 826.72
me okay yeah yeah your games are over

825.079 --> 830.3199999999999
get the hell out of

826.72 --> 830.32
here stick to your

830.959 --> 835.2399999999999
forums hey LSG good to see

835.92 --> 841.04
you behold the pill horse yes I remember

838.839 --> 841.0400000000001
that

845.279 --> 855.0
but I never read it just to be

850.6 --> 855.0
clear my point is is that

855.72 --> 862.6800000000001
esoterics the further away you are from

858.44 --> 862.6800000000001
the age of a esoteric

864.32 --> 871.0400000000001
symbol the more likely it is you only

867.44 --> 871.0400000000001
get a skeletal

871.079 --> 877.079
set of understandings from those times

874.279 --> 881.32
out of it but the amazing thing is is

877.079 --> 886.079
that new esoteric insights that did not

881.32 --> 889.12
exist were not envisioned back then will

886.079 --> 893.279
emerge from the old

889.12 --> 897.6
symbols like an old tree an old tree

893.279 --> 900.759
stump will still spring forth new little

897.6 --> 903.0
little twigs

900.759 --> 906.279
after

903.0 --> 909.959
centuries a new thing will emerge from

906.279 --> 912.8
the old esoteric symbols that those

909.959 --> 915.279
people that rolled that out probably

912.8 --> 915.279
hadn't

918.8 --> 924.7199999999999
envisioned so it's like esoterics are

921.44 --> 924.72
like this weird

925.12 --> 932.519
timless thing a living

929.519 --> 932.519
information

935.44 --> 941.639
thing and even regarding esoterics like

939.04 --> 945.0
that is

941.639 --> 947.92
esoteric yeah so it's a very esoteric

945.0 --> 947.92
show today thus

948.12 --> 952.0
far low level with

957.92 --> 960.92
me

962.88 --> 965.56
welcome to my

968.759 --> 973.6
show

970.8 --> 976.7199999999999
right yeah glad you get it clutch it's

973.6 --> 979.3190000000001
not only good analogy and interesting it

976.72 --> 983.36
is

979.319 --> 986.079
magical that the way our minds interpret

983.36 --> 986.0790000000001
esoteric

986.839 --> 994.0790000000001
symbols changes it

990.24 --> 998.12
or it doesn't change the old symbol it

994.079 --> 999.16
just you take the seed an old seed and

998.12 --> 1002.68
then

999.16 --> 1005.4399999999999
grow newer things out of

1002.68 --> 1007.5999999999999
it and that could be like

1005.44 --> 1010.6
reinterpretations that are totally

1007.6 --> 1012.88
missing the mark right because an old

1010.6 --> 1015.0
esoteric symbol could have been like

1012.88 --> 1018.48
highly specific let's say we take like

1015.0 --> 1020.16
an old Babylonian statue or something

1018.48 --> 1021.72
and we're like oh that means this and

1020.16 --> 1025.9189999999999
that means that oh that comes from this

1021.72 --> 1029.1200000000001
and that but what if they had like

1025.919 --> 1031.3600000000001
extremely specific meanings to the exact

1029.12 --> 1033.52
shape in geometries and patterns on it

1031.36 --> 1035.8799999999999
like extremely specific and there was

1033.52 --> 1038.8799999999999
like even a mathematical

1035.88 --> 1038.88
Rao

1039.24 --> 1045.959
and you simply

1042.4 --> 1051.4
don't take notice of

1045.959 --> 1054.16
this because the the phras work the

1051.4 --> 1057.16
material that would have to be reflected

1054.16 --> 1060.2
upon of that era when that statue would

1057.16 --> 1063.16
have been made like is completely lost

1060.2 --> 1065.64
and nobody even know that ever

1063.16 --> 1069.64
existed so then you're left to

1065.64 --> 1073.88
reinterpreting it based on what you have

1069.64 --> 1080.4
available and then people naturally will

1073.88 --> 1083.24
expand upon it and growing this new Med

1080.4 --> 1085.1200000000001
meaning like new branches growing out of

1083.24 --> 1087.76
an old tree

1085.12 --> 1089.8799999999999
stump this will keep happening this

1087.76 --> 1093.2
naturally happens with esoterics and so

1089.88 --> 1096.0390000000002
it's like esoteric symbols literally can

1093.2 --> 1096.039
grow new

1096.08 --> 1103.8799999999999
meaning based on the spirit of the

1100.2 --> 1106.6000000000001
times isn't that just

1103.88 --> 1110.0800000000002
fascinating and like good to keep in

1106.6 --> 1112.6399999999999
mind also like very good to keep in mind

1110.08 --> 1115.3999999999999
with in relation to personal ego

1112.64 --> 1117.48
struggles like oh you're into esoterics

1115.4 --> 1119.2
you go somewhere and they're like yeah

1117.48 --> 1121.4
we're interpreting oh of course this

1119.2 --> 1123.48
means that and that and you're like no

1121.4 --> 1127.2
it doesn't mean that it means this and

1123.48 --> 1129.559
this well why are you having this

1127.2 --> 1132.64
radically different interpretation it's

1129.559 --> 1135.96
probably because you're attuned to

1132.64 --> 1141.6000000000001
different Spirit of the times of when it

1135.96 --> 1144.919
was interpreted like even like within

1141.6 --> 1148.28
relatively not too distant

1144.919 --> 1151.7990000000002
past similar symbols would have been

1148.28 --> 1154.84
interpreted in a very different way like

1151.799 --> 1156.72
let's say early 20th century a lot of

1154.84 --> 1159.36
symbols went around especially through

1156.72 --> 1162.3600000000001
the theosophical society that studied it

1159.36 --> 1165.1999999999998
and esoterics all over the place it

1162.36 --> 1167.3999999999999
would have had very specific type of

1165.2 --> 1169.919
interpretations that we now look upon

1167.4 --> 1172.159
and say like that's a little that's

1169.919 --> 1175.3600000000001
interesting but a little

1172.159 --> 1177.44
outdated why because of the spirit of

1175.36 --> 1180.12
the times we have more information

1177.44 --> 1180.1200000000001
available

1180.2 --> 1186.2
which or different types of information

1183.08 --> 1189.12
available which make us see different

1186.2 --> 1192.0800000000002
things in between the

1189.12 --> 1196.1999999999998
esoterics that they wouldn't have seen

1192.08 --> 1198.12
in the early 20th century and so their

1196.2 --> 1200.24
interpretation will Branch off in a

1198.12 --> 1202.36
different direction Guided by different

1200.24 --> 1205.52
guidelines based on the spirit of those

1202.36 --> 1208.4799999999998
times compared to our interpretations of

1205.52 --> 1210.8799999999999
how they interpret it in these times

1208.48 --> 1213.159
based on the in information available to

1210.88 --> 1213.159
us

1214.2 --> 1218.52
now if you keep that in mind

1220.32 --> 1226.32
then it's it will be much more

1224.08 --> 1228.3999999999999
comforting to your ego and less

1226.32 --> 1230.72
threatening when you deal with other

1228.4 --> 1233.3200000000002
people that have another interpretation

1230.72 --> 1233.32
of certain

1237.48 --> 1243.679
esoterics because esoterics are like a

1241.08 --> 1243.6789999999999
living

1248.24 --> 1252.559
information you find new understanding

1251.4 --> 1255.919
based

1252.559 --> 1260.6
on what is happening in the

1255.919 --> 1260.6000000000001
time where you are

1262.87 --> 1266.06
[Music]

1268.679 --> 1273.76
need to read a dictionary to keep up

1270.559 --> 1276.9189999999999
with me a come on it's not that it's not

1273.76 --> 1276.919
that complex come

1282.32 --> 1290.84
on how many complex word have I been

1286.559 --> 1290.84
using I mean it's mostly just

1297.72 --> 1304.13
esoterics maybe we should look up the

1301.03 --> 1304.1299999999999
[Music]

1308.799 --> 1315.72
word yeah intended for or likely to be

1313.08 --> 1317.6789999999999
understood by only a small number of

1315.72 --> 1320.52
people with specialized knowledge or

1317.679 --> 1320.52
interest

1320.88 --> 1325.88
and that is almost a a little puzzle in

1326.279 --> 1333.52
itself so it means hidden another way of

1330.52 --> 1336.4
interpreting it is complex hidden

1333.52 --> 1336.4
meanings in

1338.88 --> 1344.96
between so it is like a a

1342.44 --> 1347.8400000000001
fractal

1344.96 --> 1350.52
structure that can be formed within

1347.84 --> 1350.52
meaning and

1374.96 --> 1382.039
information psychological lens that's

1378.88 --> 1382.0390000000002
that's fascinating a man

1384.32 --> 1389.24
go

1386.52 --> 1390.96
right well in a way that's kind of what

1389.24 --> 1394.84
I just tried to

1390.96 --> 1394.8400000000001
do emphasizing

1395.24 --> 1401.0
that like the mystical

1397.96 --> 1404.48
aspect is always there within the

1401.0 --> 1406.6
fractal meaning of something

1404.48 --> 1409.679
itself but the whole point about

1406.6 --> 1410.8799999999999
mysticism is that can never be resolved

1409.679 --> 1413.76
it can never

1410.88 --> 1417.1200000000001
be locked down

1413.76 --> 1419.039
permanently there's never an end to

1417.12 --> 1423.4799999999998
it but the

1419.039 --> 1425.679
psychology well that that I just

1423.48 --> 1427.559
addressed which has a lot to do with the

1425.679 --> 1429.919
spirit of the

1427.559 --> 1432.6399999999999
times because the spirit of the times

1429.919 --> 1434.1200000000001
will determine a lot about the

1432.64 --> 1437.44
psychological function and

1434.12 --> 1442.12
interpretation of a person in that

1437.44 --> 1442.1200000000001
time hey blue pill Evolution good to see

1448.96 --> 1454.159
you esoteric teachings as a

1451.48 --> 1459.159
manifestation of collective

1454.159 --> 1459.159
unconscious symbols of Psych deeper

1466.559 --> 1470.36
aspect I don't know

1470.52 --> 1477.24
manifestation of this psyche maybe if

1474.32 --> 1480.1589999999999
you if you put it into the

1477.24 --> 1482.2
psyche I'm taking it out of the psyche

1480.159 --> 1484.7990000000002
and I'm saying like it is like in the

1482.2 --> 1487.2
akashik library almost it's just in the

1484.799 --> 1491.039
information and your psyche can tap into

1487.2 --> 1493.0
it with a colored lens based on the

1491.039 --> 1496.679
spirit of the

1493.0 --> 1499.279
times but I mean esoteric symbols are

1496.679 --> 1503.5590000000002
technically Eternal like as long as it

1499.279 --> 1507.72
physically exists people can bump into

1503.559 --> 1507.72
it and start interpreting

1513.6 --> 1517.1999999999998
it hello brick

1527.32 --> 1540.07
topper

1529.48 --> 1540.07
[Music]

1546.64 --> 1551.6000000000001
ah do I follow any particular teachings

1550.6 --> 1553.9599999999998
or

1551.6 --> 1560.24
psychology that's a good question and

1553.96 --> 1560.24
the answer is a very very solid no

1567.52 --> 1572.279
do I have a

1569.24 --> 1576.2
favorite well I have some favorite

1572.279 --> 1576.2
methods I like the Socratic

1576.76 --> 1582.32
method it's very simple and it

1580.08 --> 1585.799
is

1582.32 --> 1591.52
like it is

1585.799 --> 1591.52
perfect soat trees so rates was a

1606.919 --> 1612.279
legend human men's philosopher and

1609.279 --> 1614.96
psychology well guess what I read it as

1612.279 --> 1617.159
philosophy and not psychologist because

1614.96 --> 1619.559
I literally gave you an answer in a

1617.159 --> 1620.72
philosopher I mean I am not interested

1619.559 --> 1623.24
in

1620.72 --> 1626.2
psychologists especially the mainstream

1623.24 --> 1630.279
ones I think they were all kind of

1626.2 --> 1633.24
misguided eugenesis mostly the ones that

1630.279 --> 1633.24
we get to read

1647.159 --> 1650.159
about

1653.399 --> 1656.6399999999999
hey Rich G good to see

1664.31 --> 1667.54
[Music]

1677.12 --> 1684.4399999999998
you

1679.88 --> 1684.44
man my chat's buzzing today

1707.12 --> 1710.12
great

1723.919 --> 1733.519
right also some good Community News it

1727.519 --> 1733.519
seems like uh the yeast is finally

1737.039 --> 1744.76
receding

1739.919 --> 1744.76
I'll leave I'll leave that up for you to

1750.76 --> 1757.1589999999999
interpret but

1753.12 --> 1759.5189999999998
uh yeah it seems like C

1757.159 --> 1760.519
codington own Benjamin stream has

1759.519 --> 1765.039
finally

1760.519 --> 1769.679
been decided to uh take care of uh all

1765.039 --> 1771.919
the bizarre trolling and all that

1769.679 --> 1775.039
and uh

1771.919 --> 1777.3600000000001
yeah they all went after me and they all

1775.039 --> 1779.8799999999999
got banned

1777.36 --> 1783.84
yesterday so it seems like the whole

1779.88 --> 1786.8400000000001
Hitler meme show can now at this point

1783.84 --> 1786.84
be completely

1796.36 --> 1803.799
reversed yeah that's right Richie

1801.279 --> 1806.44
G I mean it's about damn time you would

1803.799 --> 1809.559
say but I mean

1806.44 --> 1811.919
hey it's finally happening like now I

1809.559 --> 1814.6789999999999
can actually just watch the stream and

1811.919 --> 1816.8400000000001
say some things without immediately

1814.679 --> 1819.72
getting a [ __ ] storm of trolls talking

1816.84 --> 1821.1999999999998
about Baldwin and gay Wizard and all

1819.72 --> 1825.679
that

1821.2 --> 1828.48
nonsense just to try to ruin it so

1825.679 --> 1831.679
that's great I can finally just

1828.48 --> 1835.08
have fun in there and be

1831.679 --> 1838.6000000000001
myself so I'm

1835.08 --> 1840.84
like quite ecstatic about

1838.6 --> 1842.1999999999998
that it is nice

1840.84 --> 1844.8799999999999
[Music]

1842.2 --> 1848.039
indeed and it's not just nice for me

1844.88 --> 1851.7990000000002
because since that's happening like

1848.039 --> 1854.36
actual real people just start piping up

1851.799 --> 1856.6
again because literally those [ __ ]

1854.36 --> 1861.24
trolls that went after me like they

1856.6 --> 1861.24
scared away the ACT still normal people

1861.279 --> 1868.12
too because it just it's like just

1865.32 --> 1870.48
trolls Sly running in and just smearing

1868.12 --> 1872.36
[ __ ] on the walls like yeah regular

1870.48 --> 1875.0
people don't really want to sit and talk

1872.36 --> 1875.0
in between

1878.08 --> 1881.6
that so it's

1883.799 --> 1889.9189999999999
great I'm like really happy about that

1895.88 --> 1899.44
ah Rejoice

1901.159 --> 1908.7600000000002
indeed BB has taking action I don't know

1904.24 --> 1911.919
if BB has taken action I'm not sure but

1908.76 --> 1911.919
codington certainly

1916.84 --> 1919.84
did

1921.48 --> 1926.3990000000001
but maybe Owen did actually like start

1924.279 --> 1930.039
to catch on it too because there were

1926.399 --> 1934.7199999999998
more like anti- Arwin troll

1930.039 --> 1937.8799999999999
chats or uh super chats and all that and

1934.72 --> 1939.919
he was probably getting a bit like

1937.88 --> 1942.24
thought it was getting a bit tedious too

1939.919 --> 1942.24
I don't

1944.12 --> 1949.7199999999998
know but yeah it's finally getting

1946.96 --> 1953.1200000000001
cleaned up

1949.72 --> 1953.1200000000001
and it's

1957.559 --> 1962.639
great just like the sun suddenly coming

1960.159 --> 1962.6390000000001
out of the

1967.559 --> 1971.8799999999999
clouds the birds singing in the

1974.279 --> 1979.34
background it's

1976.84 --> 1982.52
great

1979.34 --> 1982.52
[Music]

1984.799 --> 1991.08
what are my thoughts on the

1987.84 --> 1993.1999999999998
eclipse yeah uh what are my thoughts on

1991.08 --> 1995.4399999999998
the eclipse it's a special one that's

1993.2 --> 1995.44
for

1996.559 --> 2004.24
certain I mean it's it's a n it's the

1999.32 --> 2006.76
Neve Eclipse it's one that has

2004.24 --> 2009.76
been foreseen

2006.76 --> 2009.76
and

2010.039 --> 2016.0
accommodated for centuries so there's

2013.039 --> 2016.0
something big going to

2020.88 --> 2026.679
happen right

2022.799 --> 2026.679
and that could be in all

2030.559 --> 2036.519
directions right shit's going down in

2033.84 --> 2039.72
Russia all of a sudden in

2036.519 --> 2039.72
Moscow like

2043.799 --> 2049.0
yeah I think of I've been saying it like

2046.919 --> 2052.28
there's a good chance a hot war will

2049.0 --> 2052.28
literally come out of

2055.0 --> 2058.8
it

2056.879 --> 2062.3199999999997
and I've

2058.8 --> 2066.599
suspected that there might be a phoenix

2062.32 --> 2068.3990000000003
event where basically the new deep State

2066.599 --> 2071.079
because I'm not going to kid

2068.399 --> 2072.5989999999997
kid anybody about or myself or anybody

2071.079 --> 2075.679
else about that it's going to be some

2072.599 --> 2078.28
Grassroots thing but that a new deep

2075.679 --> 2080.96
state will take over the old deep State

2078.28 --> 2082.639
and the old deep state will burn and the

2080.96 --> 2085.679
new deep state will rise out of its

2082.639 --> 2089.0
ashes and then there will be Rejoice at

2085.679 --> 2092.32
least for a while until eventually much

2089.0 --> 2095.2
quicker than people will

2092.32 --> 2097.76
realize or then then people will hope

2095.2 --> 2101.3199999999997
that much quicker people will realize

2097.76 --> 2105.6400000000003
that it is basically still the Old Guard

2101.32 --> 2105.6400000000003
except no more Marxist

2107.68 --> 2114.3999999999996
tactics that's what I think will

2110.88 --> 2118.48
happen lots of false

2114.4 --> 2118.48
Flags or actual

2121.24 --> 2128.2
Flags I think that a lot of supposed

2123.92 --> 2131.88
false flag organizations are like quite

2128.2 --> 2135.16
identified by now as like who they're

2131.88 --> 2135.1600000000003
actually the front group

2136.96 --> 2142.32
for like I think it's kind of safe to

2140.04 --> 2145.7599999999998
say by now that

2142.32 --> 2150.3590000000004
generally whenever something like Isis

2145.76 --> 2153.2400000000002
or is or any of that does anything

2150.359 --> 2155.88
people will like as a reflex now at this

2153.24 --> 2158.0789999999997
point just immediately point at the CIA

2155.88 --> 2161.48
and the United States like yeah that's

2158.079 --> 2164.96
their front group

2161.48 --> 2170.319
like so it's like yeah you can call it a

2164.96 --> 2170.319
false flag but I mean people

2170.44 --> 2178.839
know like what flag it's a false flag

2175.48 --> 2180.96
covering for by now so is that really a

2178.839 --> 2183.52
false flag when people just know like oh

2180.96 --> 2186.359
yeah that flag oh yeah that's not a an

2183.52 --> 2188.68
outsider that's actually an ally of that

2186.359 --> 2191.44
flag so it's not really a false flag

2188.68 --> 2191.44
then anymore is

2193.27 --> 2199.4
[Music]

2195.119 --> 2203.119
it right I think that the overall era of

2199.4 --> 2205.2400000000002
the false flag is ending it doesn't work

2203.119 --> 2210.7200000000003
anymore

2205.24 --> 2210.72
cuz it's figured out too quickly

2216.52 --> 2219.52
now

2233.77 --> 2239.029
[Music]

2239.56 --> 2244.0
can you reveal any more detail about

2241.56 --> 2246.319
what will happen directly after an

2244.0 --> 2251.0
eclipse no not

2246.319 --> 2253.92
really I I mean I could give you

2251.0 --> 2257.24
some some pointers but I don't really

2253.92 --> 2257.2400000000002
know exactly what will

2261.48 --> 2268.0
happen I just know

2265.0 --> 2271.28
that in the coming months there's going

2268.0 --> 2274.0
to be some moves that are

2271.28 --> 2277.7200000000003
made

2274.0 --> 2282.079
and the best case scenario is that with

2277.72 --> 2282.0789999999997
without cities getting blown

2282.839 --> 2290.16
up that there will be a change of the

2286.4 --> 2290.1600000000003
guard in the United

2306.44 --> 2309.44
States

2312.44 --> 2317.0
something will happen well my prediction

2314.839 --> 2319.2
is that something will happen like in

2317.0 --> 2323.48
the weeks following

2319.2 --> 2325.7999999999997
it like before summer even

2323.48 --> 2328.56
starts It's like because it's building

2325.8 --> 2332.079
up hard it's building up really hard the

2328.56 --> 2336.44
energy is building up really hard so

2332.079 --> 2338.04
hard that when I face it thus far it

2336.44 --> 2341.4
just

2338.04 --> 2342.87
like I'm going ballistic over it I'm

2341.4 --> 2344.319
going

2342.87 --> 2347.319
[Music]

2344.319 --> 2347.319
ballistic

2349.44 --> 2355.4
so the energies are just so strong it's

2352.599 --> 2358.319
like that can't just mean that it's

2355.4 --> 2361.28
still going to take

2358.319 --> 2363.7599999999998
months I think that things will happen

2361.28 --> 2366.96
relatively quickly the intensity with

2363.76 --> 2368.96
which Maneuvers are being made are very

2366.96 --> 2371.359
intense

2368.96 --> 2372.88
it's just going to yeah it's going to

2371.359 --> 2377.16
amount to

2372.88 --> 2380.359
a A quickening or a critical mass

2377.16 --> 2380.359
reaction as it

2381.56 --> 2386.839
were and I think that

2384.119 --> 2389.0
like the way things are set up it's like

2386.839 --> 2390.92
there's going to be a hot war between

2389.0 --> 2393.359
Russia and the United

2390.92 --> 2397.52
States

2393.359 --> 2400.839
or the Phoenix event and I I doubt that

2397.52 --> 2402.64
the people that are there and ready and

2400.839 --> 2405.68
have been building up to it for a long

2402.64 --> 2407.2799999999997
time to take over from within the Deep

2405.68 --> 2410.0789999999997
State I think that they're not just

2407.28 --> 2412.599
going to allow a hot War to basically

2410.079 --> 2412.599
ruin

2413.36 --> 2416.679
[Music]

2422.72 --> 2427.4399999999996
everything right and by the way if that

2425.359 --> 2429.7599999999998
happens then things will dramatically

2427.44 --> 2431.839
change around as well because there will

2429.76 --> 2434.88
be a shift in the balance of powers in

2431.839 --> 2437.88
in many ways

2434.88 --> 2439.28
internationally like China right now is

2437.88 --> 2443.52
in a

2439.28 --> 2447.3590000000004
very there I say overconfident position

2443.52 --> 2447.359
and that is going to change for

2451.28 --> 2459.44
them cuz once this

2455.88 --> 2462.56
crazy set Chic communist nonsense from

2459.44 --> 2465.88
the United States against Russia

2462.56 --> 2467.48
stops and NATO and all that just

2465.88 --> 2470.2000000000003
collapses

2467.48 --> 2473.319
politically well that will literally

2470.2 --> 2473.319
shift the balance of

2473.96 --> 2479.88
power and it will change the relations

2477.079 --> 2479.88
between the

2480.079 --> 2488.88
powers right so yeah pretty radical

2484.8 --> 2490.8390000000004
change overall like you you can well you

2488.88 --> 2493.48
don't have to but you can trust my words

2490.839 --> 2495.72
on it I'm predicting that it's as far as

2493.48 --> 2499.079
I go

2495.72 --> 2500.9599999999996
really and I'm I'm really certain about

2499.079 --> 2503.8
that there is something going to

2500.96 --> 2503.8
dramatically

2507.56 --> 2512.839
change all right a man go yes thanks for

2510.44 --> 2516.0
being there see you around hello Duke

2512.839 --> 2516.0
nuk by the way good to see

2516.24 --> 2519.24
you

2527.64 --> 2532.839
will there be a Changing of the Guard

2529.52 --> 2532.839
yes yes there

2540.8 --> 2546.119
will it will be quite astounding too

2543.76 --> 2548.6400000000003
because it's the way it's going to

2546.119 --> 2552.559
happen is like

2548.64 --> 2555.5989999999997
it's just old people out new people in

2552.559 --> 2557.8390000000004
and like very quickly pick it

2555.599 --> 2561.1600000000003
up like people are going to be a bit

2557.839 --> 2563.64
shocked about it that like suddenly this

2561.16 --> 2567.0
Biden government and this the

2563.64 --> 2568.96
arrangements are like literally in a

2567.0 --> 2571.4
very short time span without any

2568.96 --> 2573.2
bureaucracy in between or anything are

2571.4 --> 2575.96
just going to like roll out like

2573.2 --> 2579.0
literally be retracted

2575.96 --> 2582.119
disappear and new people are just

2579.0 --> 2586.24
quickly going to move in and like

2582.119 --> 2588.96
actually start doing their

2586.24 --> 2592.52
job a phoenix

2588.96 --> 2596.88
event a sudden

2592.52 --> 2600.2
rise who will come in Trump

2596.88 --> 2602.44
no no not

2600.2 --> 2604.7999999999997
yet it will

2602.44 --> 2607.4
be

2604.8 --> 2609.2000000000003
a a person whose name I'm not not going

2607.4 --> 2611.48
to

2609.2 --> 2612.5589999999997
say but it will be more like a Dem

2611.48 --> 2615.8
missionary

2612.559 --> 2619.3190000000004
function until the elections happen and

2615.8 --> 2621.48
then I don't see how Trump wouldn't be

2619.319 --> 2625.7599999999998
wouldn't win after

2621.48 --> 2628.2400000000002
that or maybe maybe he will maybe but

2625.76 --> 2633.28
the point is that by it's too short a

2628.24 --> 2635.4799999999996
time span from this spring to the actual

2633.28 --> 2638.52
elections because then they'd have to

2635.48 --> 2641.2
like really prove

2638.52 --> 2644.88
that the elections were stolen

2641.2 --> 2647.7999999999997
Etc that's going to take too

2644.88 --> 2649.8
long like by the time they've proven it

2647.8 --> 2651.319
he's already been reelected so there's

2649.8 --> 2654.48
no

2651.319 --> 2657.359
point it could be that for a few months

2654.48 --> 2660.16
the United States will like not have a

2657.359 --> 2662.5989999999997
president and still

2660.16 --> 2666.04
run on the Deep

2662.599 --> 2669.04
State the new deep

2666.04 --> 2669.04
state

2669.76 --> 2673.6800000000003
is the election about the Phoenix

2690.119 --> 2694.92
no what are you talking about level with

2696.04 --> 2699.04
me

2703.72 --> 2708.1189999999997
threel agencies like most of the free

2706.0 --> 2711.64
letter agencies are just doing what they

2708.119 --> 2715.319
do because they've been greenlighted or

2711.64 --> 2718.7999999999997
even told to do that by the communist

2715.319 --> 2718.8
Marxist Biden

2719.88 --> 2725.2000000000003
government right I mean as soon as that

2722.92 --> 2729.76
all changes the command structure

2725.2 --> 2734.0
changes then they will like gladly adapt

2729.76 --> 2736.1600000000003
back gladly most of it and I mean the

2734.0 --> 2739.76
only real problems that I foresee that

2736.16 --> 2742.44
could happen is that certain CIA

2739.76 --> 2745.4
elements will go completely Rogue and

2742.44 --> 2750.839
will cause trouble for years to

2745.4 --> 2753.119
come and will still try to incite false

2750.839 --> 2757.52
Flags across the country like they will

2753.119 --> 2759.88
continue their program despite them

2757.52 --> 2763.4
not they're not supposed to do that

2759.88 --> 2766.2400000000002
anymore cuz they'll want yeah they'll

2763.4 --> 2769.92
just want to continue that destructive

2766.24 --> 2769.9199999999996
program like that could

2771.68 --> 2776.1189999999997
happen but I mean it's not going to last

2777.8 --> 2784.4
forever so yeah that's the only real

2780.8 --> 2787.76
issue I see is that the CIA parts of it

2784.4 --> 2790.079
because CIA is huge and Bloated

2787.76 --> 2792.7200000000003
and all kinds of

2790.079 --> 2795.88
hidden parts of it and all

2792.72 --> 2799.7999999999997
that and they will cause

2795.88 --> 2804.119
trouble but not like the CIA not the the

2799.8 --> 2805.8390000000004
head of it it's just that they

2804.119 --> 2808.04
distant

2805.839 --> 2810.24
factions that are not really all that

2808.04 --> 2812.04
much under control they may literally

2810.24 --> 2814.72
like turn

2812.04 --> 2819.079
code and just start continuing the

2814.72 --> 2821.5989999999997
program despite the program being ended

2819.079 --> 2824.4
like that is something that could be ex

2821.599 --> 2824.4
that you should

2828.319 --> 2833.44
expect right and if the alleged

2831.44 --> 2837.2400000000002
information coming out

2833.44 --> 2840.16
about Isis claiming the terror attack in

2837.24 --> 2842.7599999999998
in Moscow that just happened

2840.16 --> 2845.839
yesterday well then that might even

2842.76 --> 2848.8390000000004
already be the unrolling of the Rogue

2845.839 --> 2848.839
factions

2849.48 --> 2855.88
cuz those factions want that hot

2853.16 --> 2858.1189999999997
War they want the hot war with Russia

2855.88 --> 2860.88
they want to destroy their

2858.119 --> 2863.88
relationship and they want to

2860.88 --> 2863.88
destroy

2865.839 --> 2871.24
America because they are fundamentally

2868.48 --> 2871.2400000000002
insane and

2875.839 --> 2878.839
satanic

2879.4 --> 2883.2000000000003
so yeah there it goes there's my

2886.2 --> 2892.1189999999997
predictions right let's all just hope

2888.599 --> 2895.0
that there's not going to be any big

2892.119 --> 2897.079
bombs wiping out a lot of military bases

2895.0 --> 2900.24
in potentially a couple of cities let's

2897.079 --> 2901.559
just hope that won't get to that point

2900.24 --> 2905.4399999999996
because it

2901.559 --> 2908.96
could if this thing is left a Fester

2905.44 --> 2913.44
long enough like eventually the leg will

2908.96 --> 2915.04
have to be cut off yeah that's how that

2913.44 --> 2919.16
goes

2915.04 --> 2922.5589999999997
so remedy better arrive quickly or

2919.16 --> 2922.5589999999997
there's going to be some major

2935.72 --> 2940.9599999999996
losses is there any similarities between

2938.52 --> 2943.359
America and Nazi Germany doing dude

2940.96 --> 2946.52
Richard G I don't even know where to

2943.359 --> 2949.839
begin I don't think Nazi Germany was

2946.52 --> 2953.92
anything anything at all like what we're

2949.839 --> 2957.04
being taught about it like at

2953.92 --> 2958.6800000000003
all I think that the entire history

2957.04 --> 2962.2
we've been taught about it is been

2958.68 --> 2962.2
completely flipped upside

2965.72 --> 2971.9599999999996
down

2967.76 --> 2974.4
like not just covered up totally flipped

2971.96 --> 2974.4
upside

2980.0 --> 2985.28
down so I don't even know how to compare

2989.22 --> 2992.29
[Music]

2992.92 --> 2999.7200000000003
it it's always in no but not everything

2996.0 --> 2999.72
is always in inverted not this

3000.58 --> 3003.8489999999997
[Music]

3021.64 --> 3027.5589999999997
much it's like logically it's true that

3025.28 --> 3031.92
any any Empire or

3027.559 --> 3035.52
whatever that stands up reemerges from a

3031.92 --> 3038.48
dark period that they are great for a

3035.52 --> 3041.839
while and then they slowly corrupt and

3038.48 --> 3044.079
become Rusty and more

3041.839 --> 3047.0
authoritarian and less

3044.079 --> 3050.2400000000002
caring about its own people Etc that

3047.0 --> 3052.48
logically happens with Empires right the

3050.24 --> 3055.64
way Nazi Germany is being portrayed is

3052.48 --> 3058.64
that they were just evil from the

3055.64 --> 3058.64
start

3058.96 --> 3062.2400000000002
and I don't buy that at

3062.839 --> 3068.799
all and I think that in the

3065.839 --> 3072.04
end there were they were probably

3068.799 --> 3074.599
getting highly polluted as in I think

3072.04 --> 3077.64
basically I'm going to blame it on them

3074.599 --> 3080.4
that I basically think that Jesuits

3077.64 --> 3080.4
infiltrated

3080.88 --> 3087.4
it or arguably even Hitler surrendered

3085.559 --> 3088.8390000000004
it

3087.4 --> 3094.079
and then went

3088.839 --> 3099.2
away and left it to lesbian replacement

3094.079 --> 3099.2000000000003
Hitler who really love to shout a

3108.96 --> 3113.92
lot

3111.559 --> 3117.7200000000003
right that's what I

3113.92 --> 3121.88
think didn't OB talk about this y

3117.72 --> 3121.8799999999997
today he might have brought it up

3123.799 --> 3129.48
sure I mean it's a subject that he's

3126.799 --> 3131.559
brought up a while ago and then he said

3129.48 --> 3134.28
like oh he was a

3131.559 --> 3136.119
lesbian but I immediately had a

3134.28 --> 3139.3590000000004
different Theory and the show is still

3136.119 --> 3143.1600000000003
there still there on record and that is

3139.359 --> 3148.2
like no there're two different

3143.16 --> 3151.48
people two different people not the same

3148.2 --> 3154.3999999999996
person and om Benjamin only recently a

3151.48 --> 3158.52
few weeks ago started saying like that

3154.4 --> 3162.0
that might be it but his original skit

3158.52 --> 3165.799
was H Hitler was always a

3162.0 --> 3170.68
lesbian which was funny but that made me

3165.799 --> 3170.68
think like no no they're two different

3173.0 --> 3179.079
people and I put it in the show title

3176.64 --> 3180.1189999999997
when I talked about that on my show over

3179.079 --> 3185.2400000000002
a year

3180.119 --> 3185.2400000000002
ago as proof of the timing of

3187.359 --> 3195.04
it I can actually look that up for

3191.559 --> 3197.7200000000003
you so you can scroll back in my shows

3195.04 --> 3197.72
it's still

3197.839 --> 3204.0789999999997
there and see that I did actually talk

3201.839 --> 3204.0789999999997
about

3205.44 --> 3211.2400000000002
it

3208.079 --> 3211.2400000000002
all right so where is

3228.319 --> 3235.44
it yeah it's

3231.64 --> 3238.1189999999997
1345 it show

3235.44 --> 3240.92
1345

3238.119 --> 3243.839
five did the bankers in the Vatican

3240.92 --> 3245.96
replace Hitler with a lesbian

3243.839 --> 3248.96
woman that's the

3245.96 --> 3248.96
show

3249.079 --> 3253.6800000000003
1345 can look it up yourself it's still

3256.68 --> 3261.319
there

3258.319 --> 3264.04
yeah that's in the time

3261.319 --> 3265.96
when Owen was still just talking about

3264.04 --> 3268.2799999999997
oh Hitler was always a lesbian with this

3265.96 --> 3270.92
F and all that

3268.28 --> 3273.48
and and just like oh he just changed a

3270.92 --> 3276.319
lot I don't think so I don't think that

3273.48 --> 3277.64
a a woman would be going through World

3276.319 --> 3280.96
War

3277.64 --> 3285.2
I get

3280.96 --> 3287.92
command end up on the hospital table for

3285.2 --> 3292.4399999999996
being subjected to a gas attack and that

3287.92 --> 3294.2000000000003
they wouldn't like uh that's a

3292.44 --> 3296.92
woman

3294.2 --> 3300.2
yeah that's one [ __ ] of woman

3296.92 --> 3303.92
then bro I

3300.2 --> 3307.8799999999997
mean she was continually on

3303.92 --> 3311.04
math so yeah I mean put any lesbian on

3307.88 --> 3314.359
meth continually and they will be like

3311.04 --> 3318.24
that allegedly some of

3314.359 --> 3321.2799999999997
them but yeah was not a really nice

3318.24 --> 3321.2799999999997
person for

3325.319 --> 3328.319
sure

3330.88 --> 3335.48
there were a lot of nasty trolls in the

3332.72 --> 3339.7599999999998
chat yeah well not anymore

3335.48 --> 3339.76
lelot codington took care of

3345.48 --> 3350.64
him but yeah I mean those trolls have

3348.079 --> 3353.44
been there for quite a while following

3350.64 --> 3355.5589999999997
me around and everything and seems like

3353.44 --> 3358.96
they're now shutting the hell up all of

3355.559 --> 3358.96
a sudden which is

3361.24 --> 3364.24
great

3364.44 --> 3370.2000000000003
what oh Butch of a woman oh I misread

3370.28 --> 3377.599
that lesbian slang okay I don't know

3374.52 --> 3380.28
anything about lesbian slang I'm sorry

3377.599 --> 3383.119
but I'm not really sorry don't know much

3380.28 --> 3383.119
about gay

3385.24 --> 3390.2799999999997
subculture

3387.4 --> 3390.28
right but

3391.839 --> 3396.5589999999997
yeah it's all very interesting isn't

3404.319 --> 3409.96
it you know what the weirdest thing was

3407.599 --> 3412.559
I was subjected to this level of

3409.96 --> 3416.76
information to an

3412.559 --> 3418.2000000000003
extent like when I was like

3416.76 --> 3422.079
15 or

3418.2 --> 3425.68
16 somebody sprang that on to me and it

3422.079 --> 3425.6800000000003
like completely blew my

3426.079 --> 3430.039
mind and it was shocking too because it

3428.799 --> 3433.28
was

3430.039 --> 3437.3590000000004
like at a very young age when I was like

3433.28 --> 3440.3190000000004
barely capable of like handling the ex

3437.359 --> 3442.88
yeah that the world is that evil tends

3440.319 --> 3444.44
to be that government didn't have our

3442.88 --> 3446.76
best interest at heart like I could

3444.44 --> 3449.28
barely even handle that

3446.76 --> 3452.3190000000004
and then somebody telling me like hey

3449.28 --> 3455.6400000000003
you know about that that World War II

3452.319 --> 3457.92
Nazi Germany yeah that's a complete

3455.64 --> 3460.5589999999997
inside out job it's

3457.92 --> 3462.88
like there's all these things

3460.559 --> 3465.6800000000003
that that are

3462.88 --> 3467.559
hidden all these speeches that are like

3465.68 --> 3469.319
forbidden and nobody allowed to talk

3467.559 --> 3470.96
about it and everybody keeps it secret

3469.319 --> 3473.2799999999997
you'll never see it on the television

3470.96 --> 3475.119
and if you like talk about that they'll

3473.28 --> 3478.1600000000003
come after

3475.119 --> 3481.1600000000003
you it's

3478.16 --> 3481.16
like

3486.559 --> 3495.28
amazing and like I'd like to say that

3491.4 --> 3498.119
from what I gathered even energy wise

3495.28 --> 3500.76
the original Hitler the real

3498.119 --> 3504.92
man not the the

3500.76 --> 3508.44
postwar shouty the Jews are the problem

3504.92 --> 3510.52
but the original Hitler was actually

3508.44 --> 3514.76
quite an amazing

3510.52 --> 3518.44
person with with like a great good

3514.76 --> 3522.76
energy a good energy and not

3518.44 --> 3526.92
negative not hateful at all and he

3522.76 --> 3530.599
actually seemed to like be in contrast

3526.92 --> 3535.039
to the other nations be very protective

3530.599 --> 3538.039
of Jews like in speeches I mean like

3535.039 --> 3538.039
what

3541.359 --> 3545.52
it's all magical to

3552.039 --> 3557.4
me subject taken down back in the day

3555.48 --> 3558.96
maybe yeah I'm not going to post any

3557.4 --> 3563.28
videos or anything and I'm not going to

3558.96 --> 3566.599
make any very specific claims that are

3563.28 --> 3569.039
illegal right but by just

3566.599 --> 3572.44
I can say these things I believe that I

3569.039 --> 3574.88
believe that he was like really

3572.44 --> 3577.319
concerned with Jews and tried to protect

3574.88 --> 3580.92
them and he's like

3577.319 --> 3583.319
caught had speeches like complaining to

3580.92 --> 3585.559
other nations why aren't you helping

3583.319 --> 3585.5589999999997
them

3587.92 --> 3595.119
out like why does Germany have to take

3591.16 --> 3598.92
all of them in and willing to do it but

3595.119 --> 3601.96
like having econom problems Etc and like

3598.92 --> 3601.96
it's like

3603.359 --> 3609.0789999999997
wow right but that was before the war

3606.079 --> 3611.76
though so when yeah when war was

3609.079 --> 3614.96
declared on Germany they did not declare

3611.76 --> 3617.48
war it was declared on them that changed

3614.96 --> 3620.119
everything and I think that after that

3617.48 --> 3623.16
point the original Hitler with all his

3620.119 --> 3625.44
amazing Charisma and everything he

3623.16 --> 3626.52
buil I think that that is the moment

3625.44 --> 3629.119
where he left

3626.52 --> 3632.119
for

3629.119 --> 3632.119
Argentina

3633.119 --> 3640.1600000000003
and arguably the Vatican started to get

3637.48 --> 3643.92
involved and and take it take over the

3640.16 --> 3647.359
entire project and then the whole death

3643.92 --> 3651.119
[ __ ] like the death Nazis became part of

3647.359 --> 3655.0389999999998
it it it turned satanic in

3651.119 --> 3657.4
ways right and most of Nazi or regular

3655.039 --> 3659.079
Germany in the war wouldn't even have

3657.4 --> 3662.039
really known about

3659.079 --> 3665.6800000000003
that most of them were just soldiers

3662.039 --> 3669.7200000000003
just like yeah we're just doing our duty

3665.68 --> 3671.0789999999997
and and they weren't even sadistic and a

3669.72 --> 3675.9599999999996
lot of them were

3671.079 --> 3678.319
probably like weirded out of the flip

3675.96 --> 3681.16
around of the narrative where before

3678.319 --> 3683.839
it's like yeah we protect Jews and then

3681.16 --> 3685.64
suddenly like this new raging Hitler ah

3683.839 --> 3687.44
the Jews are the problem of everything

3685.64 --> 3689.839
well a lot of Germans would have been

3687.44 --> 3691.88
very very uncomfortable with the sudden

3689.839 --> 3694.7599999999998
switch around of that and they would

3691.88 --> 3698.079
have just like well like Germans also do

3694.76 --> 3701.7990000000004
kind of like okay boss whatever you say

3698.079 --> 3703.6400000000003
boss like that but not really like oh

3701.799 --> 3705.359
yeah finally we're going to get after

3703.64 --> 3709.64
the Jews and like

3705.359 --> 3712.24
No No No

3709.64 --> 3715.16
Nonsense Spielberg

3712.24 --> 3717.839
fantasy absolutely nothing like that

3715.16 --> 3717.839
that's what I believe

3718.76 --> 3724.039
right and as to like what exactly the

3722.24 --> 3727.16
details are of what happens and the

3724.039 --> 3731.44
numbers I'm not even going to like go in

3727.16 --> 3733.5989999999997
the direction of addressing that so like

3731.44 --> 3736.359
I'll just leave that all to everybody

3733.599 --> 3740.799
else to to bicker about that like I

3736.359 --> 3740.799
don't care I don't care about those

3742.68 --> 3747.799
details I'm much more interested in Pre

3746.52 --> 3749.599
World War

3747.799 --> 3754.48
II

3749.599 --> 3759.039
Germany how it was what they actually

3754.48 --> 3761.0
did main Chef was Jewish right blue as

3759.039 --> 3764.119
I've said this before like the half his

3761.0 --> 3764.119
freaking cabinet was

3765.16 --> 3771.96
Jewish like he he was the man I've heard

3769.4 --> 3775.48
rumors that I definitely can't confirm

3771.96 --> 3778.52
I've heard rumors that Jews at the time

3775.48 --> 3780.72
actually thought of Hitler as like some

3778.52 --> 3784.0
kind of Jewish

3780.72 --> 3784.0
Messiah for

3790.839 --> 3797.24
real and then very likely that after he

3794.96 --> 3801.279
was switched out and the new lesbian

3797.24 --> 3804.24
Hitler started raging on about evil Jews

3801.279 --> 3807.839
that they probably all freaked the hell

3804.24 --> 3810.5989999999997
out like really Big Time Freak the hell

3807.839 --> 3813.599
out because like yeah their Messiah

3810.599 --> 3816.3590000000004
suddenly turns into a devil it seems I

3813.599 --> 3818.4
mean I would freaking freak out it would

3816.359 --> 3820.88
be like yeah Germany this is like the

3818.4 --> 3822.599
the safe country for Jews like we got

3820.88 --> 3824.76
this great leader who was always being

3822.599 --> 3826.6800000000003
very protective us and suddenly he's

3824.76 --> 3830.559
talking about all the Jews are evil like

3826.68 --> 3834.0389999999998
what the [ __ ] scared as hell like wanted

3830.559 --> 3839.8390000000004
to get out of there

3834.039 --> 3839.8390000000004
probably wasn't he partly rth shout

3839.88 --> 3843.7200000000003
no I highly doubt

3844.2 --> 3849.5589999999997
it I think that it's really like

3847.2 --> 3853.319
consciously the Rothchilds that actually

3849.559 --> 3853.3190000000004
betrayed him and ruined

3855.079 --> 3862.88
it I think that Rothchild family played

3858.559 --> 3867.7200000000003
a critical role in basically poisoning

3862.88 --> 3867.7200000000003
the well that was Hitler

3867.96 --> 3870.64
one way or the

3876.64 --> 3884.0789999999997
other yeah that's right no Hitler did

3880.88 --> 3884.079
help found

3884.52 --> 3894.079
Israel he gave them

3887.44 --> 3894.079
money out of the bank and sent them to

3894.64 --> 3899.0789999999997
Palestine

3896.92 --> 3899.079
you

3899.64 --> 3905.0789999999997
know really clear good see you yeah and

3902.72 --> 3908.3999999999996
that's indeed why I'm

3905.079 --> 3909.8390000000004
saying the World War II narrative it's

3908.4 --> 3912.319
all

3909.839 --> 3915.119
false I'm not going to get into specific

3912.319 --> 3918.359
details it's just that everything seems

3915.119 --> 3923.0
completely flipped upside down

3918.359 --> 3924.96
180° like totally flipped not just all

3923.0 --> 3927.599
things were erased something else no

3924.96 --> 3931.839
like totally in

3927.599 --> 3931.839
Reverse like the complete

3943.0 --> 3946.52
opposite that's what I

3948.359 --> 3953.72
think and that train of thinking isn't

3951.16 --> 3955.44
going to change I think after like

3953.72 --> 3957.5589999999997
that's not going to change around like

3955.44 --> 3960.4
this this is what I think about it this

3957.559 --> 3961.799
is what I feel about it I don't care for

3960.4 --> 3964.88
the

3961.799 --> 3967.319
details I'm not going to concern myself

3964.88 --> 3967.319
with

3974.24 --> 3980.3999999999996
numbers but I do think that basically it

3977.559 --> 3983.48
all switched around Hitler

3980.4 --> 3987.2400000000002
evacuated to Argentina and perhaps from

3983.48 --> 3991.44
there to Antarctica or who

3987.24 --> 3995.0389999999998
knows and another person took over for

3991.44 --> 3995.039
him who was a

3995.92 --> 4002.559
woman a woman who like to to yell under

3999.48 --> 4002.559
influence of meth

4002.96 --> 4008.92
lot and probably

4005.839 --> 4012.48
Jesuit I I really heavily suspect the

4008.92 --> 4017.52
Jesuits being involved and they are like

4012.48 --> 4017.52
there on photo and all that

4020.359 --> 4023.279
there's photos of

4042.4 --> 4047.1600000000003
that that's where mangala was in the

4044.96 --> 4050.16
Argentina

4047.16 --> 4050.16
huh

4058.319 --> 4063.44
fascinating right but look I don't know

4061.0 --> 4066.2
all the details I'm really just trying

4063.44 --> 4070.88
to put together a rough picture at this

4066.2 --> 4070.8799999999997
point is still

4071.52 --> 4078.079
sloppy I'm still gathering information

4074.4 --> 4081.2400000000002
about it trying to figure out more

4078.079 --> 4083.319
details but I mean those speeches that

4081.24 --> 4087.0789999999997
Hitler gave like

4083.319 --> 4090.68
being outraged to other countries about

4087.079 --> 4092.6800000000003
how their treatment of Jews I mean that

4090.68 --> 4096.599999999999
really made an improve like I'm not

4092.68 --> 4100.3189999999995
going to forget that like

4096.6 --> 4100.319
that's that's a spell

4104.44 --> 4107.44
breaker

4109.97 --> 4115.92
[Music]

4120.759 --> 4124.159
how to tell which history is

4129.719 --> 4138.199
true the one that's being covered

4134.44 --> 4139.08
up yeah you just take the pieces that

4138.199 --> 4141.48
have been

4139.08 --> 4144.44
suppressed you put them together and

4141.48 --> 4149.12
then everything else that contradicts

4144.44 --> 4152.839
those pieces of solid evidence must be

4149.12 --> 4156.839
disregarded which eventually leads to

4152.839 --> 4160.799
you having to disregard absolutely

4156.839 --> 4163.679
everything everything that was graft put

4160.799 --> 4163.679
together about

4164.359 --> 4167.359
it

4173.77 --> 4177.459000000001
[Music]

4194.32 --> 4197.32
all

4200.0 --> 4206.199
how to detect a coverup is not just made

4202.96 --> 4210.88
up what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4206.199 --> 4213.839999999999
the coverup is literally the made

4210.88 --> 4217.76
up that's why it's a

4213.84 --> 4222.159000000001
cover you cover it with something else

4217.76 --> 4222.159000000001
that is made up that is what a cover up

4222.48 --> 4230.5599999999995
is yeah and the pieces of evidence that

4226.84 --> 4233.04
contradict that cover up are then to be

4230.56 --> 4236.1990000000005
kept out of the loop kept out of

4233.04 --> 4239.88
people's attention kept out of media at

4236.199 --> 4242.799999999999
all cost for a very long time now with

4239.88 --> 4245.400000000001
internet and social media these pieces

4242.8 --> 4247.719
of information will just spread

4245.4 --> 4250.08
underground and so there is no more

4247.719 --> 4252.44
cover up because there is no more

4250.08 --> 4256.64
centralized control of media in order to

4252.44 --> 4259.12
establish that cover up as a permanent

4256.64 --> 4264.12
thing how do you know which is which you

4259.12 --> 4264.12

about it Pope's

4548.08 --> 4557.4
Army this one way of seeing

4551.159 --> 4557.4
it it's more like a ancient Secret

4563.84 --> 4570.679
Service specialized in rewriting

4568.28 --> 4573.44
history in that sense I think that

4570.679 --> 4576.719
that's what they did with Nazi Germany

4573.44 --> 4579.0
that's why they even got involved they

4576.719 --> 4583.8
rewrote the

4579.0 --> 4586.12
history all of it they created another

4583.8 --> 4587.84
picture of it

4586.12 --> 4591.84
basically to

4587.84 --> 4591.84

5104.48 --> 5109.799999999999
that and no luod I don't give permission

5107.719 --> 5114.88
to do that at

5109.8 --> 5119.2390000000005
all sharing on any platform you deem fit

5114.88 --> 5122.0
is sharing the link that doesn't mean

5119.239 --> 5125.04
you can restream yeah it's a very

5122.0 --> 5128.88
different word sharing

5125.04 --> 5131.239
is sharing the link to my show or

5128.88 --> 5133.76
posting the link on a forum so that

5131.239 --> 5137.28
people can watch it in that Forum it

5133.76 --> 5141.2390000000005
does not mean copy it on your own

5137.28 --> 5144.36
channel and then play it on your channel

5141.239 --> 5148.839999999999
that's what that doesn't mean that's why

5144.36 --> 5148.839999999999
I use the word share

5153.239 --> 5158.5599999999995
specifically

5155.639 --> 5158.56
anyway thanks for the

5178.8 --> 5181.8
update

5183.239 --> 5186.239
interesting

5190.61 --> 5206.44
[Music]

5205.04 --> 5210.5199999999995
all right

5206.44 --> 5212.28
so legally and I think this is pretty

5210.52 --> 5216.080000000001
much

5212.28 --> 5220.88
International if you say share

5216.08 --> 5225.28
that explicitly doesn't mean make a copy

5220.88 --> 5228.36
yeah this is same for like video or

5225.28 --> 5231.44
DVDs like Alex Jones back in the day

5228.36 --> 5235.96
when he had like all his like conspiracy

5231.44 --> 5238.96
videos subject oriented he said buy it

5235.96 --> 5240.96
and make copies and redistribute those

5238.96 --> 5245.679
copies you have my full permission like

5240.96 --> 5249.199
that's what he said it's very specific

5245.679 --> 5252.2390000000005
yeah make copies well if you make a copy

5249.199 --> 5256.599999999999
that means you literally take it from my

5252.239 --> 5256.599999999999
YouTube platform and put it on something

5258.159 --> 5264.48
else right that's why I don't use the

5261.88 --> 5269.04
word

5264.48 --> 5272.919999999999
copy you just share it share it

5269.04 --> 5275.199
basically means share the link but also

5272.92 --> 5277.92
you can embed

5275.199 --> 5281.599999999999
my video on something so it's not just

5277.92 --> 5285.92
the link you can do with the video as

5281.6 --> 5288.84
you see de fit you can put it on a

5285.92 --> 5292.679
platform but it's got to be linked to my

5288.84 --> 5295.679
YouTube channel you can't copy my video

5292.679 --> 5299.08
and put it on another

5295.679 --> 5301.04
platform cuz that will be a copyright

5299.08 --> 5303.8
infringement and as soon as I find out I

5301.04 --> 5305.36
will strike you it's not you you

5303.8 --> 5309.96
wouldn't be be the first

5305.36 --> 5312.5199999999995
person who's tried that so legally I am

5309.96 --> 5316.76
in the right and always have been with

5312.52 --> 5321.52
how I say it share on any platform you

5316.76 --> 5324.639
deem fit that does not mean copy on any

5321.52 --> 5328.159000000001
platform you deem fit copy and

5324.639 --> 5332.36
redistribute it means share the link or

5328.159 --> 5332.36
embed the video from my

5333.04 --> 5336.04
channel

5336.199 --> 5338.638999999999
all right

5339.88 --> 5346.88
anyhow pirated

5342.239 --> 5346.879999999999
software the [ __ ] are you talking about

5348.119 --> 5351.5599999999995
[ __ ] oh I

5353.719 --> 5358.56
don't I have what do you mean someone

5357.04 --> 5361.239
who the [ __ ] you think you are get the

5358.56 --> 5361.2390000000005
[ __ ] out of here

5363.04 --> 5366.04
[ __ ]

5372.89 --> 5376.02
[Music]

5391.719 --> 5399.08
yeah I'm going to get my Illuminati KW

5395.119 --> 5399.08
and my coffee be right

5422.96 --> 5425.96
back

5452.92 --> 5455.92
for

5482.92 --> 5485.92
for

5487.76 --> 5495.1990000000005
all right anyway let's get back to the

5491.04 --> 5495.199
subjects cuz they were pretty damn

5496.08 --> 5501.119
interesting

5497.92 --> 5506.04
before nonsense tried to get it way

5501.119 --> 5506.04
in your back did you miss anything not

5506.32 --> 5512.04
much some dip [ __ ] try to live stream my

5510.639 --> 5514.28
live

5512.04 --> 5515.719
stream which they're definitely not

5514.28 --> 5518.48
allowed to

5515.719 --> 5521.159
do I definitely never gave anybody

5518.48 --> 5524.119
permission to do

5521.159 --> 5528.5199999999995
that and my wording can definitely not

5524.119 --> 5532.199
be legally interpreted as meaning that I

5528.52 --> 5532.1990000000005
did so let's move

5542.84 --> 5545.84
on

5557.679 --> 5564.84
right H anyway I kind of wanted to move

5561.44 --> 5564.839999999999
on away from The

5565.719 --> 5571.639
Whole World War II Germany history being

5569.0 --> 5575.0
flipped inside out

5571.639 --> 5577.400000000001
anyway I think I've said

5575.0 --> 5582.0
gave enough hints maybe one day I'll

5577.4 --> 5582.0
give more like I'll do more elaborate

5585.6 --> 5591.84
research I think overall it is a subject

5588.4 --> 5594.638999999999
that's going to be like really dug

5591.84 --> 5599.4400000000005
up and reig it

5594.639 --> 5599.4400000000005
out people want to know what really

5599.56 --> 5605.679
happened they don't care anymore for

5602.76 --> 5607.159000000001
these fake stories and propaganda that

5605.679 --> 5609.4800000000005
we're made to

5607.159 --> 5613.799999999999
believe the level of

5609.48 --> 5616.239
propaganda has migrated into total

5613.8 --> 5618.159000000001
absurdism for quite a while already and

5616.239 --> 5619.48
people are sick of it and they want the

5618.159 --> 5624.199
truth they want

5619.48 --> 5625.599999999999
to have their nonsense spells dispelled

5624.199 --> 5628.04
and they want to know what really

5625.6 --> 5628.04
happened

5630.0 --> 5634.96
now patent said we defeated The Wrong

5632.719 --> 5638.44
Enemy

5634.96 --> 5638.44
Paton knew

5641.199 --> 5646.129999999999
something you would have to

5643.08 --> 5646.13
[Applause]

5647.4 --> 5650.4
conclude

5659.46 --> 5665.719
[Music]

5662.719 --> 5665.719
right

5681.84 --> 5686.159000000001
anyhow hope you still you guys are still

5683.96 --> 5688.159
all here enjoying the show might have

5686.159 --> 5690.32
been a bit of a

5688.159 --> 5693.119
distraction Buton was talking about

5690.32 --> 5695.639
Russia well not Russia about communist

5693.119 --> 5695.639
Russia

5695.96 --> 5699.039
[Music]

5700.88 --> 5706.76
yeah it's a good thing that Russia

5703.56 --> 5706.76
defeated communist

5708.08 --> 5712.88
Russia that they grew out of it I'm very

5711.199 --> 5717.4
happy about

5712.88 --> 5722.639
it it's a great relief also a sign

5717.4 --> 5724.879999999999
that evil eventually always defeats

5722.639 --> 5728.639
itself

5724.88 --> 5733.719
even though it might take like

5728.639 --> 5737.119
Generations but it has Russia has

5733.719 --> 5737.119
defeated that

5748.679 --> 5756.719
communism which means like we

5752.32 --> 5759.36
can any anybody any Nation can overcome

5756.719 --> 5761.36
communism even if it's ruled

5759.36 --> 5764.799999999999
you for a

5761.36 --> 5767.36
century and that's a very good sign if

5764.8 --> 5767.360000000001
you ask

5771.84 --> 5778.76
me an evil will always do its damage

5776.0 --> 5778.76
damage to the

5782.08 --> 5786.199
history Why was the lesbian Hitler story

5785.44 --> 5790.638999999999
not

5786.199 --> 5790.638999999999
known well why do you think it wasn't

5790.84 --> 5796.2390000000005
known cuz you're not supposed to talk

5793.52 --> 5801.719
about it if you ask too many questions

5796.239 --> 5804.48
then you're a Neo-Nazi or anti-semite or

5801.719 --> 5808.4
something yeah then eventually people

5804.48 --> 5811.678999999999
like yeah we're just going to leave that

5808.4 --> 5813.839999999999
alone but I mean it was known that

5811.679 --> 5817.719
Hitler's body in the bunker that was

5813.84 --> 5822.28
burnt that was found back

5817.719 --> 5825.639
was determined to be the body the

5822.28 --> 5829.239
skeleton of a

5825.639 --> 5834.0
woman and not a

5829.239 --> 5836.4
man that that that that they Hitler that

5834.0 --> 5838.56
was actually a female would be lesbian

5836.4 --> 5841.159
that's literally my

5838.56 --> 5843.76
artistic

5841.159 --> 5846.599999999999
interpretation like I indulge I'm just

5843.76 --> 5847.76
going to say that like yeah that Hitler

5846.6 --> 5851.400000000001
was a

5847.76 --> 5854.84
lesbian because I freaking say so and I

5851.4 --> 5858.598999999999
think it's funny and who gives a [ __ ]

5854.84 --> 5860.88
it's freaky enough that it was a

5858.599 --> 5865.1990000000005
woman and it is

5860.88 --> 5868.84
crazy sounds crazy because it is crazy

5865.199 --> 5872.4

weather I really hope

5999.26 --> 6002.43
[Music]

6002.679 --> 6007.88
so not I hope I'm not the only one

6005.32 --> 6007.88
enjoying

6009.32 --> 6014.92
it didn't Russian troops discover the

6011.96 --> 6014.92
bodies yes they

6015.88 --> 6018.9490000000005
[Music]

6022.32 --> 6029.959
did

6024.47 --> 6029.959
[Music]

6052.239 --> 6059.28
for

6054.32 --> 6060.799999999999
[Music]

6059.28 --> 6062.95
all right anyway I'm going to take a two

6060.8 --> 6068.359
minute break I'll be right

6062.95 --> 6068.3589999999995
[Music]

6082.239 --> 6085.239
back

6112.239 --> 6115.239
for

6142.159 --> 6145.159
for

6145.2 --> 6172.119
[Music]

6170.36 --> 6175.119
and I'm

6172.119 --> 6175.119
back

6177.48 --> 6182.32
the lesbian story is nuts yeah well

6180.679 --> 6184.32
reality is

6182.32 --> 6190.119
nuts and I

6184.32 --> 6193.04
mean it was a woman skeleton so it was a

6190.119 --> 6195.639
woman a woman that hung around with

6193.04 --> 6198.76
another woman all the time yet didn't

6195.639 --> 6201.96
have any kids with the woman a bunch of

6198.76 --> 6207.04
dogs I'm

6201.96 --> 6210.52
sorry but but by any universal

6207.04 --> 6210.5199999999995
standard that's a

6211.119 --> 6215.44
lesbian you

6214.23 --> 6220.0
[Music]

6215.44 --> 6220.0
know I don't know what to tell

6221.24 --> 6228.199
[Music]

6232.04 --> 6235.04
you

6244.76 --> 6248.320000000001
right quickly dispose of Hitler's body

6247.32 --> 6254.719
yeah

6248.32 --> 6258.639
because Russia was in on the narrative

6254.719 --> 6258.639
craft they were in on

6259.719 --> 6265.719
it

6261.28 --> 6265.719
yeah it's what coming this

6266.32 --> 6275.96
do rewrite history and write God any

6272.0 --> 6279.719
relation to God out of that

6275.96 --> 6283.76
history strip it all down so there's

6279.719 --> 6286.199
nothing left to erase the

6283.76 --> 6290.52
collective knowledge and memory of

6286.199 --> 6293.919999999999
people so they could be mindless drones

6290.52 --> 6296.4400000000005
it's what communism does

6293.92 --> 6299.84
universally it's their objective to

6296.44 --> 6299.839999999999
erase the minds of

6300.56 --> 6304.96
people and Jesuits invented

6305.719 --> 6312.679
it

6308.0 --> 6314.28
yeah I've said it in streams in the

6312.679 --> 6318.2390000000005
past

6314.28 --> 6320.88
first they took Christ encapsulated it

6318.239 --> 6325.5199999999995
created a false Christian religion that

6320.88 --> 6328.0
ignores Christ then they proceeded to

6325.52 --> 6331.040000000001
turn the world Inside Out Create the

6328.0 --> 6334.199
globe Earth

6331.04 --> 6338.0
lie and deny

6334.199 --> 6342.638999999999
God and replace it with Evolution

6338.0 --> 6346.52
nonsense then they created communism to

6342.639 --> 6351.84
erase the mind of the people of the

6346.52 --> 6351.84
world and falsify basically all of

6351.92 --> 6357.88
history simultaneously like through

6354.719 --> 6361.28
communism the history was

6357.88 --> 6364.2390000000005
erased and then eventually it ends up

6361.28 --> 6367.04
with complete

6364.239 --> 6369.598999999999
transhumanism yeah that's the Four

6367.04 --> 6370.92
Horsemen of the Apocalypse The Four

6369.599 --> 6374.400000000001
Horsemen of

6370.92 --> 6377.679
Doom that's how I

6374.4 --> 6381.638999999999
see the how they've proceeded how they

6377.679 --> 6381.639
started and how they are going to end

6381.92 --> 6384.92
up

6386.76 --> 6388.92
all

6389.52 --> 6394.410000000001
right anyway I'm going to take a bite of

6392.08 --> 6409.64
this Illuminati C on

6394.41 --> 6409.639999999999
[Music]

6411.84 --> 6414.84
Cheers

6416.36 --> 6424.598999999999
[Music]

6422.119 --> 6426.719
why do people think Evolution challenges

6424.599 --> 6429.8
Creation in any

6426.719 --> 6432.0
way because some people actually

6429.8 --> 6441.84
understand what it's about orinoko

6432.0 --> 6443.77
[Music]

6441.84 --> 6446.809
wumble

6443.77 --> 6446.809
[Music]

6447.08 --> 6451.119
yeah

6448.96 --> 6453.28
because

6451.119 --> 6457.839999999999
information that would

6453.28 --> 6460.0
be summarized in alleged genetics and I

6457.84 --> 6463.56
don't even know if genetics are actually

6460.0 --> 6466.92
real like that okay

6463.56 --> 6470.1990000000005
yeah but the idea of genetic and

6466.92 --> 6471.36
information storage within the design of

6470.199 --> 6475.199
a

6471.36 --> 6476.96
being is subject subjected to

6475.199 --> 6479.839999999999
entropy

6476.96 --> 6482.44
mutation is

6479.84 --> 6487.62
literally and

6482.44 --> 6488.759999999999
exclusively the Distortion and loss of

6487.62 --> 6490.8
[Music]

6488.76 --> 6494.679
information

6490.8 --> 6498.4800000000005
evolution is the claim that through the

6494.679 --> 6504.76
loss of information you could achieve a

6498.48 --> 6504.759999999999
superior form which is totally absurd

6506.159 --> 6513.719
you can't mutate which is the loss of

6509.88 --> 6513.719
information of design

6531.719 --> 6534.719
in

6539.76 --> 6547.56
okay thank you for telling me don't know

6542.56 --> 6550.320000000001
when my audio cut out but to uh to

6547.56 --> 6554.360000000001
reiterate Evolution the idea of

6550.32 --> 6558.84
evolution defies

6554.36 --> 6561.88
entropy there is there can be no loss of

6558.84 --> 6564.719
information that will lead to a better

6561.88 --> 6564.719
design

6567.599 --> 6572.88
so

6569.599 --> 6575.119000000001
Evolution and the reality of Creation

6572.88 --> 6580.28
The Inevitable ontological primitive

6575.119 --> 6580.28
reality of creation are fundamentally

6580.599 --> 6589.1990000000005
incompatible mutation is the loss of

6584.08 --> 6589.199
alleged genetic or designer

6589.28 --> 6595.199
information you could never end up with

6591.76 --> 6598.320000000001
a superior verion

6595.199 --> 6601.159
yeah that makes no damn

6598.32 --> 6603.719
sense a mutation is always a loss of

6601.159 --> 6606.92
information it's not going to lead to a

6603.719 --> 6610.719
better species it just

6606.92 --> 6613.4800000000005
can't it's always going to be less less

6610.719 --> 6616.56
Dynamic less

6613.48 --> 6620.839999999999
adaptable less

6616.56 --> 6623.030000000001
resilient evolution is just completely

6620.84 --> 6626.12
reversed reality thinking

6623.03 --> 6626.12
[Music]

6627.56 --> 6634.320000000001
also there is absolutely no actual

6630.8 --> 6637.56
physical evidence of a mutation leading

6634.32 --> 6640.08
like to another species that is that can

6637.56 --> 6644.1990000000005
survive at all there's no evidence of

6640.08 --> 6648.159
that at all yeah the only evidence that

6644.199 --> 6651.638999999999
there is is like within bacteria and

6648.159 --> 6653.44
that's adaptation they can adapt to an

6651.639 --> 6655.639
environment

6653.44 --> 6658.28
and but even adapt

6655.639 --> 6660.1990000000005
back it's that simple but that's

6658.28 --> 6663.04
adaptation that's not a mutation there's

6660.199 --> 6665.839999999999
no actual loss of information happening

6663.04 --> 6667.639
it's just a rearranging of the

6665.84 --> 6669.88
information that's already there and

6667.639 --> 6671.8
there is no loss to it CU if there's a

6669.88 --> 6674.400000000001
loss that's

6671.8 --> 6678.079000000001
irreversible yeah and all forms of

6674.4 --> 6679.879999999999
mutation throughout all forms of life

6678.079 --> 6684.5599999999995

7366.83 --> 7372.04
[Music]

7369.88 --> 7375.52
conversation although is there more even

7372.04 --> 7377.76
to talk about I mean lesbian Hitler oh

7375.52 --> 7381.8
what a triggering subject it

7377.76 --> 7383.1990000000005
is lesbian Hitler lesbian Hitler oh he

7381.8 --> 7386.88
was a

7383.199 --> 7389.96
lesbian and nobody cares it's not even

7386.88 --> 7391.88
the real Hitler the real Hitler went

7389.96 --> 7396.36
away to

7391.88 --> 7398.92
Argentina he probably lived out his

7396.36 --> 7400.759999999999
life up until like

7398.92 --> 7403.76
9080 or

7400.76 --> 7403.76
something

7416.92 --> 7420.719
that's up there with glasses being

7421.32 --> 7428.639
gay yeah but glasses being gay is

7425.88 --> 7433.719
not that's just

7428.639 --> 7433.719
silliness and my personal opinion

7434.44 --> 7439.4
oh in terms of triggering people oh yes

7436.32 --> 7439.4
for sure

7442.28 --> 7447.44
absolutely I bet there's a whole bunch

7444.48 --> 7451.159
of like

7447.44 --> 7454.839999999999
secret secret special boy

7451.159 --> 7457.4
Hitler loving nerds with

7454.84 --> 7460.719
jokes like with with glasses that are

7457.4 --> 7462.36
just like how dare you

7460.719 --> 7466.4800000000005
e

7462.36 --> 7478.4
how dare you mock him he's not a

7466.48 --> 7482.558999999999
[Music]

7478.4 --> 7485.079
lesbian but I mean like yeah the reasons

7482.559 --> 7487.88
why we even care about that at all are

7485.079 --> 7490.48
probably not the same CU a lot of people

7487.88 --> 7492.4400000000005
have special boy syndrome when it comes

7490.48 --> 7494.759999999999
to Hitler

7492.44 --> 7499.32
they have the same issue

7494.76 --> 7501.92
as certain classifications of Jews do

7499.32 --> 7504.079
where they think that they are separate

7501.92 --> 7505.639
they are better and they have a reason

7504.079 --> 7509.36
to think they are better and they hold

7505.639 --> 7514.0
on to people that roll out that

7509.36 --> 7517.239
notion and that is why a lot of people

7514.0 --> 7519.119
secretly admire Hitler because of

7517.239 --> 7522.718999999999
basically all the propaganda that has

7519.119 --> 7526.36
rolled out about him and the Uber

7522.719 --> 7528.679
mention all that nonsense which it is it

7526.36 --> 7528.679
is

7528.96 --> 7537.0
nonsense right it's my

7532.639 --> 7537.0
opinion I think of Hitler very

7539.199 --> 7544.4
differently and so when I talk about

7541.559 --> 7546.28
this it hurts those people that have

7544.4 --> 7549.799999999999
special boy

7546.28 --> 7552.5199999999995
syndrome and that secretly

7549.8 --> 7555.04
secretly admire hit

7552.52 --> 7557.679
because of all the dark stuff and all

7555.04 --> 7559.44
the special boy syndrome that they

7557.679 --> 7561.04
secretly keep inside of them and then

7559.44 --> 7563.5199999999995
like they think they're all better and

7561.04 --> 7564.8
it's all a secret and oh one day we will

7563.52 --> 7569.040000000001
rise

7564.8 --> 7572.559
again yeah yeah that's all Jesuit

7569.04 --> 7575.079
nonsense that you've guzzled up and you

7572.559 --> 7578.1990000000005
took it and you kept it a secret it's

7575.079 --> 7578.199
exactly what they

7579.04 --> 7584.92
wanted for you to keep the Devil's

7582.239 --> 7586.959999999999
Secret inside and let it ruin you let it

7584.92 --> 7589.84
write you let it disconnect you from

7586.96 --> 7592.96
reality further yeah well I'm doing

7589.84 --> 7595.679
exactly the opposite I'm saying like no

7592.96 --> 7598.36
I'm not buying any of this I don't think

7595.679 --> 7600.28
he was like that I think he had very

7598.36 --> 7601.88
admirable qualities and did very

7600.28 --> 7605.44
admirable

7601.88 --> 7605.4400000000005
things before the

7605.96 --> 7613.52
war and that's the Hitler I'd like to

7610.52 --> 7613.52
remember

7618.079 --> 7622.84
and whatever that was after the war

7620.84 --> 7624.4800000000005
started I don't even think it was him I

7622.84 --> 7627.2390000000005
think it was some

7624.48 --> 7630.919999999999
lesbian it just very shouty and on meth

7627.239 --> 7632.638999999999
all the time I don't recognize that

7630.92 --> 7634.76
person as being the same person as

7632.639 --> 7638.4400000000005
Hitler I don't

7634.76 --> 7641.719
recognize it being logically consistent

7638.44 --> 7644.678999999999
even with the drugs and all the the the

7641.719 --> 7646.639
things that

7644.679 --> 7650.96
she

7646.639 --> 7653.599
made the Empire do made Germany do

7650.96 --> 7658.4800000000005
sending soldiers to their death without

7653.599 --> 7662.96
jackets and everything like no man that

7658.48 --> 7666.5199999999995
has lived through a war would ever be

7662.96 --> 7670.079
capable of doing such a thing only an

7666.52 --> 7673.52
ignorant idiot that doesn't actually

7670.079 --> 7679.759999999999
know and has not experienced personally

7673.52 --> 7679.76
War would be capable of such delusional

7681.44 --> 7687.74
acts another important indicator that it

7685.639 --> 7690.79
wasn't the same

7687.74 --> 7690.79
[Music]

7694.02 --> 7703.4400000000005

7700.44 --> 7703.44

h

7793.52 --> 7798.009
[Music]

7809.159 --> 7815.44
right so there's been a

7812.28 --> 7818.0
little tiny little

7815.44 --> 7822.159
incident which was to be

7818.0 --> 7825.04
expected when I handed out a wrench

7822.159 --> 7827.879999999999
and it all fell through very quickly but

7825.04 --> 7830.32
yeah it could be that you've been part

7827.88 --> 7832.639
of my chat recently and you find

7830.32 --> 7835.759999999999
yourself suddenly banned without

7832.639 --> 7836.92
any explanation or knowing even when

7835.76 --> 7841.639
that

7836.92 --> 7841.639
happened and uh yeah you can contact

7841.8 --> 7849.0
me through the

7844.4 --> 7849.0
email if that is the case

7849.719 --> 7857.159
and then I can like unban

7853.92 --> 7859.8
you just to handing out that piece of

7857.159 --> 7861.28
information for anybody that might find

7859.8 --> 7864.360000000001
themselves having been

7861.28 --> 7869.119
suddenly removed without even knowing

7864.36 --> 7873.0
when it happened it's the uh the the

7869.119 --> 7873.0
risk of visiting my

7877.52 --> 7883.2390000000005
channel mut it again

7880.239 --> 7883.239
no

7940.159 --> 7943.159
e

7954.89 --> 7959.599
[Music]

7956.04 --> 7962.73
yeah my mic is acting a bit odd

7959.599 --> 7968.9400000000005
today all right thanks for letting me

7962.73 --> 7968.94
[Music]

7970.119 --> 7973.119
know

7974.5 --> 7986.17
[Music]

7991.4 --> 7994.92
he said no

7999.48 --> 8019.0599999999995
what what are you talking about

8001.88 --> 8019.06
[Music]

8030.04 --> 8033.04
about

8044.559 --> 8049.4800000000005
wow my mic is acting really weird what

8052.17 --> 8058.0
[Music]

8054.079 --> 8062.719
the okay now maybe this time it'll

8058.0 --> 8066.52
actually just stay open

8062.719 --> 8071.199
what the hell man it's weird never had

8066.52 --> 8074.4800000000005
it turn off that many times so

8071.199 --> 8074.48
quickly I don't

8075.119 --> 8080.92
know right I think that overall with the

8078.679 --> 8082.88
energies going around I might just apply

8080.92 --> 8085.599
the technique right

8082.88 --> 8089.36
now because there's a lot of hassle

8085.599 --> 8091.679
going around I feel there's a lot of

8089.36 --> 8094.119
energy going around in including

8091.679 --> 8095.8
negative stuff on troll sides because

8094.119 --> 8100.079
they don't like what's been happening

8095.8 --> 8103.4400000000005
they don't like that they're losing the

8100.079 --> 8105.04
war yeah I know you don't like it I know

8103.44 --> 8109.4
you like

8105.04 --> 8109.4
not you don't like losing the

8111.159 --> 8116.558999999999
war so I'm going to apply the technique

8114.4 --> 8119.96
off screen right away

8116.559 --> 8122.96
yeah be right

8119.96 --> 8122.96
back

8149.92 --> 8152.92
for

8209.84 --> 8212.84
e

8239.84 --> 8242.84

8269.84 --> 8272.84
okay

8273.8 --> 8276.639

8298.719 --> 8305.678999999998
down I I don't blame you though with all

8301.16 --> 8309.92
this hassle that's on the side with the

8305.679 --> 8314.04
show it's taken up quite a few minutes

8309.92 --> 8319.8
sorry about that although like like to

8314.04 --> 8324.0
think that it has yielded some results

8319.8 --> 8324.0
though and did some spring

8326.0 --> 8332.719
cleaning and I feel

8328.719 --> 8332.719
great just apply the tech

8334.16 --> 8341.599
unique and it works it works really

8338.519 --> 8343.84

about

8343.84 --> 8348.399
it the weather continues to be

8348.8 --> 8354.719
great and I feel overall a lot of

8357.88 --> 8365.16
exhilaration a rosemary plant is

8361.399 --> 8365.16
blooming let me just show

8371.16 --> 8376.8
you and I mean this thing is amazing

8374.319 --> 8380.24
because it

8376.8 --> 8383.0
it this went through the entire winter

8380.24 --> 8385.16
with all the storms and everything and

8383.0 --> 8389.64
all the

8385.16 --> 8391.16
freezing and it's like yeah I don't

8389.64 --> 8393.319
care

8391.16 --> 8394.72
I'm just this rosemary bush is just

8393.319 --> 8398.64
crushing

8394.72 --> 8400.72
it just blooming full

8398.64 --> 8404.92
out

8400.72 --> 8404.92
nice Leela purple

8407.0 --> 8412.16
blossoming it's

8409.399 --> 8414.16
amazing like I really like this specific

8412.16 --> 8417.439
plant because it's like there's

8414.16 --> 8419.64
something joyous about this rosemary

8417.439 --> 8422.52
bush like some

8419.64 --> 8424.519999999999
like it just won't give up it's like

8422.52 --> 8427.0
never going to be

8424.52 --> 8429.2
defeated and even like looking at the

8427.0 --> 8431.72
stem it's grown really

8429.2 --> 8433.880000000001
thick it does really seem like it has

8431.72 --> 8437.16
grown

8433.88 --> 8437.16
horizontally it's

8449.64 --> 8455.119999999999
awesome and yeah my mint is also getting

8453.8 --> 8458.24
all

8455.12 --> 8461.08
revitalized look at like all these green

8458.24 --> 8464.28
leaves like these are

8461.08 --> 8468.76
fresh fresh green

8464.28 --> 8470.92
leaves like these were very little stems

8468.76 --> 8472.56
not too long ago and they're really like

8470.92 --> 8476.24
exploding

8472.56 --> 8476.24
again so it's pretty

8477.72 --> 8483.0
amazing very happy that I got

8489.8 --> 8494.92
these and on top of that I just

8498.16 --> 8502.52
repotted

8499.8 --> 8505.84
repotted the

8502.52 --> 8508.52
little oregano plant I

8505.84 --> 8511.56
had but that I kept in the kitchen

8508.52 --> 8513.319000000001
because like yeah I didn't want to let

8511.56 --> 8516.56
make it sit through the

8513.319 --> 8518.96
winter but that's out there as well it's

8516.56 --> 8518.96
doing

8526.7 --> 8530.92
[Music]

8528.479 --> 8533.16
great all right let me show you I'll be

8530.92 --> 8533.16
right

8533.68 --> 8536.68
back

8539.52 --> 8542.52
this

8567.96 --> 8572.08
and the weirdest thing about this

8569.399 --> 8575.119999999999
oregano plant is that it has been just

8572.08 --> 8579.84
growing like this all throughout the

8575.12 --> 8581.800000000001
winter I bought it like when was it in

8579.84 --> 8585.6
November or

8581.8 --> 8589.119999999999
something and like it being winter it

8585.6 --> 8591.720000000001
just didn't care and it just exploded up

8589.12 --> 8593.640000000001
like in the pot it was in before this

8591.72 --> 8597.0
was like way

8593.64 --> 8598.358999999999
smaller so it grew despite being in such

8597.0 --> 8601.04
a little

8598.359 --> 8604.720000000001
pot and I really wonder like if it's

8601.04 --> 8606.800000000001
going to now explode even harder it does

8604.72 --> 8608.479
seem like there's new shoots that are

8606.8 --> 8610.399
really

8608.479 --> 8614.039999999999
Lively like

8610.399 --> 8621.319
here like extra extra thick and

8614.04 --> 8621.319000000001
green so yeah Springtime Joy all

did the glob spins thousand miles an

8776.6 --> 8781.2
hour at the

8778.84 --> 8784.24
equator why do they they say at the

8781.2 --> 8785.880000000001
equator because within the spin of the

8784.24 --> 8788.479
presupposed

8785.88 --> 8793.119999999999
globe it

8788.479 --> 8797.76
is the part that

8793.12 --> 8797.76
transverses presupposed the most

8799.96 --> 8805.8
distance right well at the poles of the

8804.2 --> 8807.359
spin at the

8805.8 --> 8810.479
[Music]

8807.359 --> 8812.92
axis there's not a lot of movement that

8810.479 --> 8812.92
happens

8815.88 --> 8823.319
overall right so just like with a disc

8819.319 --> 8825.0
if you spin a disc the outside of the

8823.319 --> 8829.319
disc

8825.0 --> 8832.12
goes like moves more distance over a

8829.319 --> 8835.479
spin cycle than the inside of a

8832.12 --> 8837.52
is that's why they say that that's why

8835.479 --> 8842.16
the equator is always

8837.52 --> 8842.16
like the point

8842.76 --> 8847.359
that it is it

8845.0 --> 8849.92
transverses I'm not sure about the use

8847.359 --> 8854.6
of that word transverses the greatest

8849.92 --> 8854.6
distance and that's why that is always

8860.64 --> 8868.16
named right and it is a universal issue

8864.08 --> 8871.16
like anything that moves in a straight

8868.16 --> 8874.8
line well then any anything about that

8871.16 --> 8879.039999999999
transfer it is it is the right word oh

8874.8 --> 8882.278999999999
Traverse H traverses thank you thank you

8879.04 --> 8884.76
for that correction I was almost

8882.279 --> 8887.279
there right but anything that moves in a

8884.76 --> 8890.279
straight line well everything about the

8887.279 --> 8894.52
thing that moves in a straight line

8890.279 --> 8896.84
moves equally every part is subjected to

8894.52 --> 8900.24
the same forces

8896.84 --> 8902.04
equally but as soon as there is a non

8900.24 --> 8906.8
straight line

8902.04 --> 8910.439
movement now suddenly you deal with

8906.8 --> 8914.278999999999
centripetal and centrifugal forces and

8910.439 --> 8917.800000000001
the forces are asymmetrically

8914.279 --> 8921.24
distributed some parts of it will be

8917.8 --> 8925.759999999998
moving within ukian space a greater

8921.24 --> 8925.76
distance than other parts of that

8928.319 --> 8934.399
object the force

8930.68 --> 8937.359
and speed distribution becomes more

8934.399 --> 8939.68
complex with a motion that is not in a

8937.359 --> 8939.68
straight

8953.359 --> 8958.359
line

8955.319 --> 8962.039999999999
right I don't know why I said transverse

8958.359 --> 8962.04
that's weird it's Traverse

8965.84 --> 8971.56
I mean it is

8968.68 --> 8974.64
a a word I still have to properly

8971.56 --> 8974.64
assimilate into my

8982.279 --> 8988.479000000001
lexicon and that includes the word

8985.72 --> 8992.479
lexicon let's make

8988.479 --> 8995.199999999999
sure vocabulary yes I used it correctly

8992.479 --> 8997.16
sometimes like oh yeah I'm going to I'm

8995.2 --> 8999.479000000001
going to say something and then

8997.16 --> 9003.119999999999
like does it actually mean what I

8999.479 --> 9005.438999999998
thought it did yeah it did

9003.12 --> 9007.720000000001
awesome it's really funny when I have to

9005.439 --> 9012.319
look up the words that I

9007.72 --> 9012.319
use and then it turns out I was

9018.96 --> 9021.96
correct

9025.279 --> 9029.960000000001
right anyhow man I've been going for two

9028.08 --> 9033.359
and a half hours

9029.96 --> 9036.759999999998
already I hope you all enjoyed the uh

9033.359 --> 9040.2
heavy show that was pretty heavy in ways

9036.76 --> 9042.960000000001
especially the esoterica part I mean

9040.2 --> 9042.960000000001
that's a big

9043.359 --> 9048.92
realization once it is very fast yeah

9046.16 --> 9051.92
yeah yeah it's all relative of course it

9048.92 --> 9051.92
is

9057.399 --> 9063.84
yeah I'd say 1,000 miles an hour that's

9061.479 --> 9063.84
pretty

9066.2 --> 9073.479000000001
fast oh but it takes a very long time

9070.52 --> 9074.960000000001
and like within a day yeah but look at

9073.479 --> 9078.399
the amount of

9074.96 --> 9080.88
distance the total equator

9078.399 --> 9085.76
length that is

9080.88 --> 9089.16
going around in one cycle of 24 hours i'

9085.76 --> 9092.0
I'd say that is quite

9089.16 --> 9096.8
fast

9092.0 --> 9101.2
yeah what is it like 4,000 miles

9096.8 --> 9101.199999999999
roughly but isn't that linear

9101.76 --> 9104.76
speed

9108.84 --> 9111.84
no

9113.319 --> 9116.88
doesn't really matter I mean yeah

9117.04 --> 9122.84
sure it's whether it is in a straight

9120.88 --> 9125.88
line of speed or whether it's in a

9122.84 --> 9127.52
circular motion that's me the only

9125.88 --> 9131.759999999998
difference that makes is like the

9127.52 --> 9135.279
consequences of its influence but the

9131.76 --> 9137.439
amount of distance traveled per time

9135.279 --> 9139.479000000001
unit is the amount of distance travel

9137.439 --> 9140.84
per time unit no matter the pathway it

9139.479 --> 9143.679999999998
takes

9140.84 --> 9143.68
it is quite

9148.84 --> 9153.880000000001
fast you don't experience it so whatever

9151.76 --> 9156.76
yeah no there is no motion the Earth is

9153.88 --> 9161.039999999999
not spinning it's not a ball and that

9156.76 --> 9161.04
Ball's definitely not spinning it's

9161.2 --> 9167.92
stationary

9164.16 --> 9171.24
yeah if it was spinning if it was a ball

9167.92 --> 9173.16
and spinning then we would see Corola

9171.24 --> 9177.8
deviation because

9173.16 --> 9177.8
gas doesn't attain

9178.479 --> 9184.08
momentum it only responds to local air

9181.399 --> 9187.439
pressure differential and resonance

9184.08 --> 9191.0
affect simatics like sound and all that

9187.439 --> 9194.92
which it would have to be subjected to

9191.0 --> 9198.64
externally yeah gas doesn't just like

9194.92 --> 9201.84
eventually just automatically goes along

9198.64 --> 9204.8
with the motion of a

9201.84 --> 9208.8
container doesn't really do

9204.8 --> 9211.479
that unlike liquids and solids which do

9208.8 --> 9213.399
attain momentum and then eventually when

9211.479 --> 9217.16
they have attained momentum you no

9213.399 --> 9219.84
longer need to insert Force to keep them

9217.16 --> 9223.2
going barely you need just a little

9219.84 --> 9226.68
Notch to keep them at the same speed

9223.2 --> 9228.800000000001
same centripetal speed yeah but not with

9226.68 --> 9231.08
gases gases have to be continually

9228.8 --> 9233.24
pushed forth

9231.08 --> 9237.84
with the same amount of

9233.24 --> 9240.8
force that's the difference gases do not

9237.84 --> 9244.04
have

9240.8 --> 9246.679999999998
momentum so if the Earth were a ball and

9244.04 --> 9248.84
that ball were spinning then we would

9246.68 --> 9250.84
have continual coris deviation because

9248.84 --> 9253.439
the gas wouldn't be spinning with the

9250.84 --> 9255.8
Earth because it doesn't do that doesn't

9253.439 --> 9257.24
attain momentum it just responds to

9255.8 --> 9261.399
local air pressure differential and it's

9257.24 --> 9265.279
going to sit still despite any solid or

9261.399 --> 9268.319
liquid objects moving underneath it

9265.279 --> 9268.319000000001
through it all

9269.16 --> 9274.319
that and we do not experience Coralis

9275.0 --> 9282.319
deviation helicopters Don't Drift Off

9279.12 --> 9283.76
hot air balloons don't drift off at a

9282.319 --> 9286.359
giant

9283.76 --> 9289.800000000001
speed always in the same

9286.359 --> 9293.84
direction airplanes don't have different

9289.8 --> 9298.199999999999
TR travel times when going east compared

9293.84 --> 9300.880000000001
to going west so Earth is definitely not

9298.2 --> 9304.279
a ball

9300.88 --> 9304.278999999999
spinning right the

9304.84 --> 9312.16
stationary does air not spin in a

9307.8 --> 9314.679999999998
centrifuge no no it does not unless

9312.16 --> 9318.92
there is a distinct barrier as part of

9314.68 --> 9320.16
the centrifuge to continually push forth

9318.92 --> 9321.52
the air

9320.16 --> 9326.479
with the spinning

9321.52 --> 9331.0
motion the centrifuge does not have a

9326.479 --> 9335.278999999999
plate that's going to push forth the air

9331.0 --> 9336.359
then the air inside will be still while

9335.279 --> 9339.52
the

9336.359 --> 9341.319
materials the liquids and the solids at

9339.52 --> 9343.439
the outer ring are subjected to

9341.319 --> 9346.199999999999
centripetal forces and they will attain

9343.439 --> 9351.6
momentum and they will spin but the air

9346.2 --> 9354.92
will sit still in between it

9351.6 --> 9358.359
it will not catch momentum and start

9354.92 --> 9361.479
rushing with it it won't do that no

9358.359 --> 9363.84
matter how fast it

9361.479 --> 9365.8
spins the only thing that's going to

9363.84 --> 9368.24
move about it is what is going to be

9365.8 --> 9370.24
pushed forth by the solid material

9368.24 --> 9373.319
sticking out

9370.24 --> 9375.92
scooping the surface of it and then

9373.319 --> 9378.56
further in it's not going to be affected

9375.92 --> 9383.84
at all it's going to stand

9378.56 --> 9387.0
still in between the rapid spin spinning

9383.84 --> 9387.0
materials that surround

9387.279 --> 9391.84
it gas does not attain

9392.2 --> 9397.240000000002
momentum so does the jet stream exist in

9396.12 --> 9399.880000000001
the

9397.24 --> 9403.68
atmosphere I don't know they might there

9399.88 --> 9407.438999999998
might be wind streams up

9403.68 --> 9409.68
there I don't know why they would be

9407.439 --> 9412.84
they definitely don't have anything to

9409.68 --> 9417.0
do with the presupposed motion of the

9412.84 --> 9420.52
Earth but there might be some kind of

9417.0 --> 9423.0
perpetually flowing wind up

9420.52 --> 9425.24
there and they could even like Go in

9423.0 --> 9426.96
different directions one height goes in

9425.24 --> 9429.88
One Direction and another height it goes

9426.96 --> 9433.88
in another the opposite direction why

9429.88 --> 9433.88
would that happen I have no

9435.24 --> 9441.84
idea so I don't know Lu

9440.04 --> 9445.6
I don't know with certainty whether

9441.84 --> 9445.6
there are supposed jet

9447.6 --> 9454.319
streams at high altitude there might be

9451.88 --> 9457.16
why would they be there I don't know but

9454.319 --> 9460.319
it's got to be some kind of external

9457.16 --> 9460.319
influence that does

9468.439 --> 9471.439
that

9472.16 --> 9479.2
you know you fly to the West Coast it

9474.92 --> 9479.2
takes longer when you fly

9479.399 --> 9482.399
back

9483.2 --> 9489.52
okay I've never heard of

9485.88 --> 9490.399
that there might be technical reasons

9489.52 --> 9493.560000000001
that

9490.399 --> 9496.599999999999
happens but it's certainly not because

9493.56 --> 9498.72
of the coris deviation that's going to

9496.6 --> 9501.08
alter the flight times because that

9498.72 --> 9505.16
doesn't happen

9501.08 --> 9505.16
there is no coris deviation of

9506.479 --> 9512.358999999999
Earth all right Loop Evolution as I said

9509.24 --> 9512.359
like there might be technical

9514.359 --> 9521.68
reasons like they take a different route

9518.399 --> 9524.479
or they have to they travel differently

9521.68 --> 9528.24
for another reason who knows why that

9524.479 --> 9528.24
is they make more

9528.439 --> 9531.439
stops

9535.0 --> 9540.6
but uh yeah there's definitely no

9537.76 --> 9543.04
differentiating travel times with

9540.6 --> 9545.56
airplanes one way and the other because

9543.04 --> 9548.160000000002
of Cora's deviation making the travel

9545.56 --> 9550.519999999999
times persistently different that

9548.16 --> 9550.52
doesn't

9550.68 --> 9557.24
happen could even be doing it on purpose

9554.6 --> 9560.640000000001
that seems a bit of a stretch I mean I

9557.24 --> 9563.359
don't think airplane like Airlines

9560.64 --> 9566.84
really care that much to reinforce glob

9563.359 --> 9568.6
belief that they would literally

9566.84 --> 9572.08
alter the

9568.6 --> 9575.6
flights just to try to suggest that that

9572.08 --> 9575.6
seems a bit bit of a

9581.399 --> 9587.519999999999
stretch yeah don't tell me what coras

9584.24 --> 9591.319
does or not does not no it's not

9587.52 --> 9591.319000000001
negligible you idiot

9592.12 --> 9597.2
[ __ ] sake is that Brenda you sound like

9598.8 --> 9603.319
Brenda there's certain levels of

9600.88 --> 9606.92
stupidity that are quite

9603.319 --> 9606.92
rare this is one of

9615.359 --> 9622.800000000001
them negligable no corel's deviation is

9619.04 --> 9622.800000000001
defin definitely not

9623.319 --> 9626.68
negligible it's

9627.0 --> 9631.68
ridiculous yeah the earth spin claim is

9630.56 --> 9634.92
very

9631.68 --> 9639.16
specific oh you didn't insult me no you

9634.92 --> 9639.16
insulted intelligence in

9641.84 --> 9647.68
general yeah making a very very stupid

9646.08 --> 9650.52
ridiculous

9647.68 --> 9654.6
unfounded statement

9650.52 --> 9657.800000000001
has no footing in reality whatsoever is

9654.6 --> 9660.960000000001
an insult to my intelligence and of

9657.8 --> 9660.96
anybody else reading

9667.18 --> 9670.249
[Music]

9678.24 --> 9688.199999999999
that

9680.25 --> 9688.2
[Music]

9690.2 --> 9697.479000000001
Corola deviation is definitely not

9694.88 --> 9699.839999999998
negligible it just doesn't happen with

9697.479 --> 9701.599999999999
Earth because Earth is not a ball and

9699.84 --> 9705.319
it's not

9701.6 --> 9707.08
spinning there is no Coral deviation

9705.319 --> 9710.84
because of

9707.08 --> 9713.359
that any provable coris deviation

9710.84 --> 9716.52
happening because of two different

9713.359 --> 9721.2
reference frames one of which is

9716.52 --> 9724.479000000001
moving that is definitely not

9721.2 --> 9727.84
negligable okay definitely

9724.479 --> 9732.039999999999
not it's very palpable that's why it has

9727.84 --> 9733.399
a name that's why it is a thing called

9732.04 --> 9736.76
cholis

9733.399 --> 9736.76
deviation not

9738.16 --> 9741.16
negligible

9744.439 --> 9750.24
if there's no rotation then you can

9746.8 --> 9753.519999999999
ignore it no if there's no rotation then

9750.24 --> 9756.399
there is no coris deviation yeah in

9753.52 --> 9759.92
order for coris deviation to happen

9756.399 --> 9763.88
there have to be two separate reference

9759.92 --> 9767.6
frames one of which is

9763.88 --> 9771.119999999999
moving if there isn't then there is no

9767.6 --> 9771.12
coris deviation

9771.399 --> 9778.16
Earth is not a ball spinning thus there

9774.72 --> 9782.16
is no coris deviation because the Earth

9778.16 --> 9782.16
isn't spinning underneath the

9782.2 --> 9791.399000000001
air right okay fair enough you might not

9786.96 --> 9791.399
be Brenda then if you're going to admit

9796.0 --> 9801.88
that if there's no deviation then ignore

9805.92 --> 9811.479
it ignore it to ignore it would suggest

9809.68 --> 9815.08
that there is something there there

9811.479 --> 9817.92
isn't you can't ignore something that

9815.08 --> 9820.96
literally isn't there it's not

9817.92 --> 9823.960000000001
negligible it's non-existent it's not

9820.96 --> 9826.72
there if it's not there how can you

9823.96 --> 9829.64
ignore it you can't ignore something

9826.72 --> 9832.679999999998
that doesn't exist you can only ignore

9829.64 --> 9832.68
something that does

9840.24 --> 9845.319
exist oh God who was the guy that did

9842.92 --> 9846.84
testing of rotation with the

9845.319 --> 9849.24
gyroscope

9846.84 --> 9853.16
uh I mean Bob

9849.24 --> 9853.16
noell may he rest in

9853.8 --> 9859.56
peace

9856.52 --> 9862.08
yeah but I mean that entire situ was

9859.56 --> 9863.88
quite ridiculous yeah if a

9862.08 --> 9866.0
gyroscope

9863.88 --> 9870.039999999999
shows

9866.0 --> 9872.24
deviation that can mean only one thing

9870.04 --> 9875.080000000002
and that thing is not that the Earth is

9872.24 --> 9879.8
spinning nor that there is an ether

9875.08 --> 9883.319
spinning it means the gyroscope is

9879.8 --> 9887.039999999999
broken because a gyroscope isn't

9883.319 --> 9891.039999999999
supposed to drift if it drifts that

9887.04 --> 9891.04
means it's dysfunctional

9891.2 --> 9899.800000000001
but for some reason everybody overlooked

9895.84 --> 9899.8
that which is

9917.96 --> 9920.96
ridiculous

9924.279 --> 9928.640000000001
yeah blue Evolution probably

9929.439 --> 9934.08
maybe and kumu virus is definitely not

9932.12 --> 9936.279
going to insert his hor [ __ ] about it

9934.08 --> 9936.279
right

9942.359 --> 9948.359
now it's not there then why worry about

9945.2 --> 9949.439
it I'm not worrying about it I'm just

9948.359 --> 9952.640000000001
making

9949.439 --> 9956.0
what is blatantly obvious I'm just

9952.64 --> 9957.76
helping people to see what is real and

9956.0 --> 9961.64
what isn't real what are the globe

9957.76 --> 9961.64
claims and how are they

9967.72 --> 9972.519999999999
debunked oh I'm breathing oh just ignore

9973.16 --> 9979.0
it yeah well that's another part of it

9976.08 --> 9980.52
right I mean there has to be containment

9979.0 --> 9982.68
physical

9980.52 --> 9986.479000000001
containment and not

9982.68 --> 9988.92
a falsely assumed to be a force that

9986.479 --> 9990.84
somehow functions like a container

9988.92 --> 9994.399
barrier even though there's no proof

9990.84 --> 9997.399
that any Force could do that nor is

9994.399 --> 10000.479
there a claim of anything being a force

9997.399 --> 10003.199999999999
in order to be claimed to be doing that

10000.479 --> 10005.72
second law of Thermodynamics definitely

10003.2 --> 10009.08
makes it a natural

10005.72 --> 10012.319
law that there has to be a specific

10009.08 --> 10013.72
physical containment in order for there

10012.319 --> 10017.519999999999
to be gas

10013.72 --> 10019.8
pressure in the first instance and form

10017.52 --> 10024.68
an equilibrium with its surroundings and

10019.8 --> 10028.16
a gradient a stable gradient as it is

10024.68 --> 10028.16
right that's another argument

10032.279 --> 10038.279
though I came to know about Pro post

10035.359 --> 10042.56
coris is so much more the clear what I

10038.279 --> 10042.560000000001
learn about it in school

10046.56 --> 10051.479
yes but that's because in school they

10049.2 --> 10053.2
don't there is this weird

10051.479 --> 10056.8
compartmentalization right because

10053.2 --> 10060.960000000001
Corola deviation is just an apparent

10056.8 --> 10062.8
deviation caused by misinterpretation of

10060.96 --> 10065.839999999998
what is moving and what

10062.8 --> 10068.24
isn't it's very simple it's an illusion

10065.84 --> 10071.04
an illusionary movement but then there

10068.24 --> 10074.92
is the high hijacked version of that

10071.04 --> 10078.439
which fed we called

10074.92 --> 10081.08
Globus that is all based on the idea

10078.439 --> 10082.64
that things are actually moving around

10081.08 --> 10085.319
because the Earth is presupposed

10082.64 --> 10088.599999999999
spinning underneath but that actually

10085.319 --> 10093.319
has nothing to do with the real coris

10088.6 --> 10097.2
effect and in schools well there's a lot

10093.319 --> 10099.278999999999
of trouble with the teachers not really

10097.2 --> 10102.279
knowing how to explain all

10099.279 --> 10102.279
this

10107.6 --> 10110.6
properly

10112.88 --> 10119.16
right right boo yeah BL Evolution but

10116.72 --> 10123.199999999999
it's not too strange that that happened

10119.16 --> 10125.0
because Corola effect has just been

10123.2 --> 10127.720000000001
purposely

10125.0 --> 10129.279
convoluted to the point where even

10127.72 --> 10132.438999999998
teachers just

10129.279 --> 10137.479000000001
get confused about

10132.439 --> 10140.2
it there's so much globi nonsense text

10137.479 --> 10144.56
even if you just look at the Wikipedia

10140.2 --> 10147.479000000001
at Corola effect you have one tiny piece

10144.56 --> 10149.64
of text with an image to demonstrate and

10147.479 --> 10152.08
that is all you need to know what

10149.64 --> 10156.88
Coral's effect is but you have like

10152.08 --> 10159.88
pages and pages of globi effect nonsense

10156.88 --> 10163.519999999999
on top of that and that's been out there

10159.88 --> 10165.358999999999
for a while so no wonder a teacher is

10163.52 --> 10168.04
going to get confused when they try to

10165.359 --> 10170.0
teach their class about Corola effect

10168.04 --> 10172.880000000001
the vast majority of information

10170.0 --> 10176.399
available is complete

10172.88 --> 10179.8
nonsense so it's not surprising to hear

10176.399 --> 10179.8
that teacher didn't get it

10187.64 --> 10193.68
right

10189.76 --> 10193.68
okay Jensen flat I don't know what he

10195.0 --> 10199.8
said that none of the Flat Earth

10197.239 --> 10201.68
Debaters including myself are impervious

10199.8 --> 10205.679999999998
to mistakes

10201.68 --> 10207.76
especially number based mistakes yeah

10205.68 --> 10210.52
especially me I'm

10207.76 --> 10214.0
like I'm not even going to

10210.52 --> 10217.640000000001
try like I hate I don't like numbers I

10214.0 --> 10220.0
don't like math it's not relevant to

10217.64 --> 10223.239
me

10220.0 --> 10226.239
I like to know form and patterns and

10223.239 --> 10230.6
consequences and ratios that's what I'm

10226.239 --> 10230.6
interested in not numerical

10235.2 --> 10240.640000000001
correctness how did I get my knowledge

10237.56 --> 10242.479
about coras well to be fair mostly

10240.64 --> 10246.8
through the Flat Earth

10242.479 --> 10250.64
debates has been discussed endlessly for

10246.8 --> 10250.64
years and eventually

10250.8 --> 10255.8
I just got it hey wood working gy

10256.08 --> 10259.6
bear good to see

10261.51 --> 10264.659
[Music]

10275.6 --> 10279.359
you wonder how that Oldtimer is doing

10277.88 --> 10282.199999999999
with the family

10279.359 --> 10282.2
yeah

10298.16 --> 10303.479
busy that explains it then explains

10304.72 --> 10311.479
what that I actually know what I'm

10306.92 --> 10311.479
talking about due to extended

10313.6 --> 10318.76
exposure listening to people bicker

10316.16 --> 10320.64
about it have misassumptions about it

10318.76 --> 10323.08
getting it wrong over and over again

10320.64 --> 10325.8
having to be corrected over and over

10323.08 --> 10328.239
again yeah that eventually makes you

10325.8 --> 10330.399
really understand how that works and how

10328.239 --> 10333.6
misconceptions about it

10330.399 --> 10336.358999999999
work yeah get exposed to that long

10333.6 --> 10338.52
enough and you can't be Fooled

10336.359 --> 10341.399000000001
Again somebody's going to get deled

10338.52 --> 10343.76
delusional about it I'll immediately be

10341.399 --> 10346.72
able to notice that and point out

10343.76 --> 10348.359
exactly how it is delusional and where

10346.72 --> 10351.16
that leads

10348.359 --> 10354.16
to like

10351.16 --> 10356.96
instantaneously that's what 5 years of

10354.16 --> 10359.439
regular daily exposure to the argument

10356.96 --> 10359.438999999998
does to

10361.88 --> 10366.599999999999
you no you weren't timed out W working

10364.399 --> 10369.16
gy bear somebody banned

10366.6 --> 10371.800000000001
you and I know who

10369.16 --> 10375.84
I had to unban

10371.8 --> 10375.84
you but it's not going to happen

10378.439 --> 10384.08
again but yeah there's been some uh some

10381.84 --> 10388.56
more wrench

10384.08 --> 10391.039999999999
issues and uh yeah two more infiltrants

10388.56 --> 10391.039999999999
have been

10397.439 --> 10400.439
routed

10412.39 --> 10415.51
[Music]

10418.319 --> 10422.56
how dare you acquire Knowledge from an

10420.279 --> 10426.6
unapproved Source Who used common sense

10422.56 --> 10430.439
and discernment that's a great saying

10426.6 --> 10430.439
woodworking welcome back

10447.399 --> 10453.519999999999
oh well thank you blue Devolution I

10449.92 --> 10457.08
really appreciate that that is most

10453.52 --> 10459.359
welcome actually kind of

10457.08 --> 10461.8
convenient awesome aome thank you thank

10459.359 --> 10461.800000000001
you for the

10461.88 --> 10467.358999999999
support I'm glad you enjoyed the show

10464.16 --> 10467.359
today it's been

10467.72 --> 10470.789999999999
[Music]

10487.319 --> 10490.319
interesting

10490.65 --> 10495.309
[Music]

10517.319 --> 10520.319
now

10522.239 --> 10526.68
thank you for the support really

10524.0 --> 10528.64
appreciate it very useful I'm actually

10526.68 --> 10531.08
going to be able to use that like right

10528.64 --> 10531.08
after the

10532.76 --> 10539.279
show oh damn big cloud coming over again

10536.96 --> 10544.88
might be another Hill

10539.279 --> 10544.880000000001
storm look at that like

10545.479 --> 10553.72
yeah see like this the weather really

10549.56 --> 10557.359
does change around a lot in just one

10553.72 --> 10557.358999999999
day just look at

10564.64 --> 10570.439
that so

10566.96 --> 10572.16
uh yeah kind of expecting it to rain or

10570.439 --> 10574.52
hail

10572.16 --> 10577.239
again

10574.52 --> 10580.239
soon

10577.239 --> 10580.239
h

10582.5 --> 10586.6
[Music]

10584.239 --> 10589.72
would you consider the moving object a

10586.6 --> 10589.720000000001
reference frame in

10589.76 --> 10596.04
coris well the moving object is as long

10593.56 --> 10596.039999999999
as it's

10596.239 --> 10602.6
detached or as long as it is

10599.359 --> 10605.92
attached like a moving platform anything

10602.6 --> 10608.52
that is detached attached to it is going

10605.92 --> 10610.2
to be part of the same reference frame

10608.52 --> 10612.640000000001
until it becomes

10610.2 --> 10615.880000000001
detached and then it will attain the

10612.64 --> 10618.68
momentum from the movement it last had

10615.88 --> 10622.119999999999
but become separated from the reference

10618.68 --> 10622.12
frame because it's no longer

10631.88 --> 10636.239
attached getting some rain in California

10634.68 --> 10639.6
but that's a good thing right blue

10636.239 --> 10644.6
Evolution I mean rain is good as long as

10639.6 --> 10644.6
it doesn't continually rain all the

10647.439 --> 10654.359
time is that a yes then it all

10651.2 --> 10659.0
depends if it's

10654.359 --> 10661.6
separated from the moving platform the

10659.0 --> 10664.6
moving reference

10661.6 --> 10664.6
frame

10666.479 --> 10671.56
then then it's no longer going to be

10669.12 --> 10674.960000000001
influenced by the moving reference frame

10671.56 --> 10674.96
if it's a part of it then it

10683.16 --> 10688.399
will they spraying outside my place no

10685.88 --> 10690.08
Jensen flat foot luckily not it's been

10688.399 --> 10695.278999999999
very clear skyed

10690.08 --> 10695.279
and I love it that way no

10697.12 --> 10700.12
spraying

10709.6 --> 10714.2
in the ball model there are no

10711.399 --> 10717.96
non-moving reference r ah that

10714.2 --> 10721.640000000001
technically so if you throw a rock or if

10717.96 --> 10723.199999999999
you would throw a rock on a presupposed

10721.64 --> 10726.0
spinning ball

10723.2 --> 10730.68
Earth then by doing

10726.0 --> 10734.84
that as you throw it it would

10730.68 --> 10738.359
detach from the spinning reference frame

10734.84 --> 10738.359
of spinning ball Earth

10739.2 --> 10745.52
yes anything that physically

10743.0 --> 10749.239
detaches from the

10745.52 --> 10752.880000000001
earth will separate itself from the

10749.239 --> 10756.039999999999
motion of that spinning reference

10752.88 --> 10760.039999999999
frame in the very specific hypothetical

10756.04 --> 10760.04
scenario of a spinning ball Earth

10760.279 --> 10763.359
which of course is not

10764.16 --> 10768.319
reality right anything that detaches

10766.84 --> 10771.08
itself

10768.319 --> 10773.88
physically from the earth and its

10771.08 --> 10777.72
presupposed motion is going to separate

10773.88 --> 10777.72
itself from that reference

10787.04 --> 10791.52
frame

10789.12 --> 10793.68
no I don't misunderstand coris a bit

10791.52 --> 10796.479000000001
just Steve Bronson don't you worry

10793.68 --> 10796.479000000001
yourself about

10806.439 --> 10812.279
that that's right blal Evolution

10812.76 --> 10819.319
exactly yes woodor and gy bear that is

10816.0 --> 10820.92
on top of the the rest of the madness

10819.319 --> 10824.479
that's where things become so

10820.92 --> 10826.56
unbelievably convoluted that it becomes

10824.479 --> 10828.56
intable concerning the different

10826.56 --> 10831.72
reference frames and their motions and

10828.56 --> 10835.0
how every like the

10831.72 --> 10837.64
centripedal incoherence Centrio chaotic

10835.0 --> 10840.04
forces of the continual motions on top

10837.64 --> 10841.68
of motions on top of motions spinning

10840.04 --> 10845.439
motion on spinning motion on spinning

10841.68 --> 10846.52
motion yeah it becomes all quite intable

10845.439 --> 10849.08
that is

10846.52 --> 10851.880000000001
correct that's why

10849.08 --> 10855.56
they only really consider any of these

10851.88 --> 10858.319
forces per separated occasion and not

10855.56 --> 10861.119999999999
compounded with all the other

10858.319 --> 10863.519999999999
presupposed Celestial colossal motions

10861.12 --> 10865.359
that are supposedly happening because it

10863.52 --> 10868.960000000001
just becomes way too

10865.359 --> 10868.960000000001
convoluted to deal with

10875.88 --> 10881.319
it centrifugal

10878.68 --> 10884.880000000001
centripetal it's

10881.319 --> 10884.88
all all that

10905.88 --> 10911.399
stuff this is incredi

10908.56 --> 10914.92
ridiculous no it isn't it's just not

10911.399 --> 10917.479
applicable to earth that is

10914.92 --> 10919.52
all I mean coriolis does happen it's

10917.479 --> 10921.358999999999
what happens when something is moving in

10919.52 --> 10925.52
relation to something

10921.359 --> 10927.319
else coris deviation or rather coris

10925.52 --> 10928.76
perception because it is really about

10927.319 --> 10932.6
the perception of

10928.76 --> 10935.92
it that does take place

10932.6 --> 10939.2
measurably it's just not applicable to

10935.92 --> 10941.2
Earth because Earth is station

10939.2 --> 10945.7
and it doesn't

10941.2 --> 10947.279
move and it definitely doesn't

10945.7 --> 10951.279
[Music]

10947.279 --> 10954.92
spin but Corola effect is just what it

10951.279 --> 10958.84
is it's a an apparent deviation an

10954.92 --> 10958.84
illusion and it does take

10965.64 --> 10971.92
place stars are moving Earth isn't

10968.68 --> 10974.52
spinning yeah or rather the stars appear

10971.92 --> 10976.72
to move cuz what are the stars you know

10974.52 --> 10980.319000000001
it's just something we

10976.72 --> 10980.319
see so yeah

10980.64 --> 10987.88
the the non-local holographic angular

10984.8 --> 10992.679999999998
manifestations of the celestial lights

10987.88 --> 10992.679999999998
appear to be rotating around the

10994.92 --> 11001.52
Observer definitely does not relate to

10997.399 --> 11001.519999999999
anything physical moving now does

11001.6 --> 11005.12
it Corel is applicable to merry go

11004.2 --> 11009.880000000001
rounds

11005.12 --> 11009.880000000001
correct anything actually provably

11026.72 --> 11029.72
moving

11033.56 --> 11037.199999999999
yeah yeah correct would working Steve

11035.52 --> 11041.76
Bronson did say it

11037.2 --> 11044.640000000001
incorrectly it's not applicable to

11041.76 --> 11048.319
Earth it's definitely applicable to

11044.64 --> 11051.92
things on Earth not to Earth

11048.319 --> 11051.92
itself Earth is not

11052.279 --> 11056.399000000001
spinning during an eclipse they look

11054.56 --> 11059.039999999999
like

11056.399 --> 11063.199999999999
projections it's all all very freaky

11059.04 --> 11066.880000000001
Jensen flat foot it is all very freaky I

11063.2 --> 11070.52
mean at any point at any type of

11066.88 --> 11072.599999999999
observation non like the non-local

11070.52 --> 11074.399000000001
holographic angular

11072.6 --> 11076.960000000001
manifestation

11074.399 --> 11079.319
idea of the

11076.96 --> 11081.599999999999
celestials like becomes more apparent

11079.319 --> 11083.68
than ever with like a solar eclipse it's

11081.6 --> 11086.319
just super surreal what you're looking

11083.68 --> 11089.239
at like every everything about what

11086.319 --> 11094.6
you're seeing especially when you go

11089.239 --> 11094.6
high up it is all just unbelievably

11095.8 --> 11102.759999999998
surreal it just looks like this this not

11099.319 --> 11102.76
this isn't a physical

11102.96 --> 11109.358999999999
reality at at such a moment if you like

11106.64 --> 11110.399
realize if you don't if you leave alone

11109.359 --> 11113.68
the

11110.399 --> 11116.039999999999
heliocentric pre assump assumptive

11113.68 --> 11118.319
conceptions it just will make you feel

11116.04 --> 11122.720000000001
like I'm in a holidex

11118.319 --> 11125.399
like this can't be real this is just too

11122.72 --> 11129.0
surreal and that's very understandable

11125.399 --> 11131.08
that you would experience that in such a

11129.0 --> 11134.279
moment now whether you're going to

11131.08 --> 11137.64
conclude like oh we live in a simulation

11134.279 --> 11140.720000000001
it's not real that's a whole different

11137.64 --> 11143.96
matter but it certainly does become

11140.72 --> 11146.679999999998
quite obvious that the heliocentric

11143.96 --> 11149.64
claims about these perceptions are just

11146.68 --> 11149.64
not working

11151.56 --> 11159.92
yeah the moon can't just be completely

11156.439 --> 11161.960000000001
invisible for days and then

11159.92 --> 11166.92
suddenly without

11161.96 --> 11170.08
any lights going past it or

11166.92 --> 11172.6
whatever just like a perfectly black

11170.08 --> 11176.72
disc just suddenly appear in front of

11172.6 --> 11181.479000000001
the Sun and do what it does like no

11176.72 --> 11181.479
there's just no no possibility of that

11182.72 --> 11189.08
whatsoever it can't just block out the

11185.56 --> 11192.88
sun like a perfect black disc when not

11189.08 --> 11196.92
even two days before that it would be

11192.88 --> 11201.119999999999
very visible in the sky even during the

11196.92 --> 11203.08
daytime as another white disc there just

11201.12 --> 11205.399000000001
no way in hell that it's suddenly going

11203.08 --> 11208.68
to completely disappear like that no way

11205.399 --> 11210.84
in hell and then like emerge as a

11208.68 --> 11214.720000000001
perfect black disc to blot out the sun

11210.84 --> 11214.72
there's just no possibility of that

11215.2 --> 11220.12
whatsoever that's even the Ancients

11217.68 --> 11222.76
would realize that preh heliocentrism

11220.12 --> 11226.2
that's why they gave that thing that

11222.76 --> 11229.0
does that block out the Sun a separate

11226.2 --> 11233.279
name as a separate black

11229.0 --> 11234.399
Celestial rahu and kuu they gave it a

11233.279 --> 11238.92
separate

11234.399 --> 11242.239
name rahu and Lilith right right black

11238.92 --> 11245.88
celestial bodies like that are

11242.239 --> 11248.92
significantly not the moon like that has

11245.88 --> 11252.278999999999
a reason yeah like they made a

11248.92 --> 11257.84
difference in preh heliocentric

11252.279 --> 11257.84
cosmology about it that that very

11265.76 --> 11269.439
significant right

11270.6 --> 11273.679
[Applause]

11277.359 --> 11280.319
you can't stand not knowing well you got

11279.0 --> 11283.2
a problem then

11280.319 --> 11285.239
because you just can't you can't really

11283.2 --> 11288.800000000001
know we can

11285.239 --> 11291.88
only figure out more

11288.8 --> 11293.759999999998
details in between what we definitely

11291.88 --> 11297.16
won't be able to

11293.76 --> 11300.279
know and eventually by the contrast of

11297.16 --> 11303.16
what you can know you can be more

11300.279 --> 11306.359
certain about what you can't know I know

11303.16 --> 11308.439
that sounds very mystical because it is

11306.359 --> 11310.960000000001
but that is how I do it there's certain

11308.439 --> 11314.2
things you can never know and if you try

11310.96 --> 11317.599999999999
to focus on filling

11314.2 --> 11319.560000000001
in the black hole like it's you're just

11317.6 --> 11323.239
lose your mind there's no hint there's

11319.56 --> 11326.64
no grasp but by the contrast of what you

11323.239 --> 11329.439
can know you can better understand what

11326.64 --> 11329.439
you can't know

11330.6 --> 11335.640000000001
yeah that's an esoteric statement by the

11332.72 --> 11338.08
way that's going to be applicable

11335.64 --> 11340.479
throughout eternity because it's about

11338.08 --> 11342.359
the very understanding of the nature of

11340.479 --> 11346.16
information and what you can and can't

11342.359 --> 11348.399000000001
know itself so that definitely Loops

11346.16 --> 11349.72
back to the beginning of the show and

11348.399 --> 11351.319
the

11349.72 --> 11353.96
title

11351.319 --> 11356.479
yeah there are some things you can never

11353.96 --> 11360.438999999998
know and the more you learn the more you

11356.479 --> 11363.399
figure out you can know but by knowing

11360.439 --> 11367.800000000001
those things in between what you can't

11363.399 --> 11368.76
know you can better figure out what you

11367.8 --> 11371.399
can't

11368.76 --> 11374.6
know and the boundaries of it and the

11371.399 --> 11374.599999999999
reasons why you can't

11375.399 --> 11383.239
know if you can't remember that what I

11378.439 --> 11386.68
just said to you for the next couple of

11383.239 --> 11391.72
decades you'll learn to develop a lot of

11386.68 --> 11391.720000000001
wisdom based on that esoteric

11415.88 --> 11420.119999999999
statement right and with that I'm going

11418.04 --> 11425.239000000001
to round out the show it's been over 3

11420.12 --> 11425.239000000001
hours and definitely uh need a

11425.319 --> 11429.84
break so yeah hopefully we can continue

11428.399 --> 11432.0
this conversation

11429.84 --> 11433.56
tomorrow looks like you guys want to

11432.0 --> 11436.64
talk more about the Jesuits I don't

11433.56 --> 11436.64
really want to get into that

11437.6 --> 11443.08
now uh my mood is really good I don't

11440.72 --> 11443.84
want to like tap into the darkness again

11443.08 --> 11448.88
like

11443.84 --> 11451.399
that right so hope you all have a great

11448.88 --> 11453.519999999999
weekend thanks everyone for coming I
