136.4 --> 141.48000000000002
right

137.28 --> 141.48
anyway the weather

143.36 --> 148.16000000000003
uh is very different than it was two

145.92 --> 149.599
hours ago

148.16 --> 152.239
because it was

149.599 --> 154.16
well not so cloudy and now it is

152.239 --> 158.16
it's actually kind of nice because it

154.16 --> 159.28
was really broody and hot this morning

158.16 --> 163.68
so

159.28 --> 163.68
i'm happy that i went to bed very early

164.16 --> 168.319
so that i could at least have enough

165.92 --> 170.319
sleep

168.319 --> 172.879
because the the heat just woke me up

170.319 --> 172.879
this morning

173.68 --> 179.36
because yeah it is kind of broody

177.2 --> 180.79999999999998
and it's not windy

179.36 --> 183.04000000000002
compared to yesterday where was

180.8 --> 185.12
relatively clear skies and a lot of wind

183.04 --> 188.959
well now

185.12 --> 191.12
well no clear skies and no wind

188.959 --> 191.12
so

191.68 --> 196.48000000000002
it's rooty and hot but right now there's

194.4 --> 198.87900000000002
just this cloud

196.48 --> 202.39999999999998
which is

198.879 --> 206.159
seriously helping the temperature

202.4 --> 208.87900000000002
hey my camera froze again

206.159 --> 208.879
oh goody

210.159 --> 213.84
anyway on the good side though

216.319 --> 219.319
right

228.4 --> 230.64000000000001
so

236.879 --> 241.67999999999998
hello there pjcnet first in chat letter

240.0 --> 244.239
sage good to see you

241.68 --> 248.15900000000002
it's raining over there okay

244.239 --> 248.159
huh well it hasn't really rained here

248.799 --> 254.48000000000002
it's just kind of moist

250.879 --> 256.15999999999997
it's just hanging in the air

254.48 --> 259.59999999999997
right

256.16 --> 259.6
let's check the temperature

262.0 --> 269.84
27 degrees celsius 50 humidity

266.639 --> 269.84000000000003
i guess it could be worse

270.72 --> 274.639
description mostly cloudy

277.199 --> 280.8
oh

278.24 --> 282.72
it seems like the storm

280.8 --> 286.72
and the rain that they predicted was

282.72 --> 289.36
coming has been moved now again

286.72 --> 291.759
to wednesday thursday

289.36 --> 291.759
okay

292.639 --> 299.04
just keep on moving it around eh predict

295.44 --> 303.28
it coming somewhere it's just like just

299.04 --> 305.52000000000004
can't seem to get the actual date

303.28 --> 307.11999999999995
for it or something i don't know i'm

305.52 --> 309.19899999999996
really taking notice i mean i look at

307.12 --> 311.12
this chart every day and it just keeps

309.199 --> 313.84000000000003
changing around

311.12 --> 313.84000000000003
dramatically

315.039 --> 317.28
so

317.759 --> 320.96000000000004
quite a prediction it's still a tricky

319.919 --> 323.039
thing

320.96 --> 324.96
especially if there's geo engineering

323.039 --> 327.199
involved

324.96 --> 329.75899999999996
and it's not

327.199 --> 331.36
really incorporated

329.759 --> 333.28000000000003
probably

331.36 --> 335.199
i mean i don't think that the geo

333.28 --> 337.11999999999995
engineers are going to roll out a

335.199 --> 340.0
program that they're going to inform the

337.12 --> 341.44
weather forecasters about

340.0 --> 343.6
or maybe they do

341.44 --> 345.919
and we just we're never told maybe it's

343.6 --> 348.88
like a weather forecast or secret or

345.919 --> 348.88
something i don't know

349.199 --> 352.72
but they just yeah

351.039 --> 356.96
the one that google brings forth just

352.72 --> 356.96000000000004
keeps moving it around the predictions

364.4 --> 368.56
right and yeah the clouds here might

366.319 --> 371.03900000000004
have been through cloud seeding because

368.56 --> 372.16
i did see a lot of trails

371.039 --> 374.639
earlier

372.16 --> 376.47900000000004
before all this cloud this cloud started

374.639 --> 380.24
to form because in the morning it was

376.479 --> 383.88
kind of hazy but it was still blue

380.24 --> 383.88
and now it isn't

402.24 --> 406.319
all right anyway how are you doing this

403.84 --> 406.31899999999996
sunday

407.039 --> 413.4
it is sunday the 4th of september 2022.

418.88 --> 425.039
that felt a bit wonky this morning

422.16 --> 427.28000000000003
but had an extra siesta

425.039 --> 431.039
before the show

427.28 --> 432.96
which really did some good

431.039 --> 435.28
and i did it downstairs because it was

432.96 --> 437.75899999999996
way too hot in here

435.28 --> 440.31899999999996
so there is a couch there

437.759 --> 442.0
just in like the general room and it is

440.319 --> 444.56
cooler there

442.0 --> 447.28
so i just went there and just had a

444.56 --> 448.84
little nap for what is it 30 to 45

447.28 --> 453.28
minutes i didn't keep

448.84 --> 453.28
count that did a lot of good

455.12 --> 462.28000000000003
hey gum nut man good to see you

458.72 --> 462.28000000000003
yeah i'm doing good

476.0 --> 479.0
oh

482.96 --> 486.96
right but it's still kind of warm

485.039 --> 492.28
it's just because it cooled down that i

486.96 --> 492.28
actually put back put a shirt back on

494.24 --> 501.199
right anyway

497.12 --> 507.28000000000003
uh yeah yesterday ball busters

501.199 --> 510.08000000000004
i went on it got a surprise apology from

507.28 --> 513.1999999999999
from kiwi for friday the way that

510.08 --> 515.5989999999999
happened so it was like oh wow

513.2 --> 515.599
thanks

516.56 --> 520.2399999999999
i didn't expect that

518.64 --> 522.7189999999999
i thought he'd probably forgotten about

520.24 --> 525.6
it but he hadn't but yeah i was okay

522.719 --> 527.519
anyway this show was interesting

525.6 --> 528.48
uh

527.519 --> 533.48
was

528.48 --> 533.48
decently active on it this time

534.0 --> 537.519
but yeah

535.2 --> 538.8000000000001
yesterday to me was a very energetic day

537.519 --> 542.5600000000001
i i mean

538.8 --> 544.399
i played the jungle fever song

542.56 --> 546.88
on my show listen back to it and the

544.399 --> 548.48
quality was absolutely perfect so it was

546.88 --> 550.16
a perfect rollout

548.48 --> 552.24
sometimes i'm

550.16 --> 555.12
i wonder like oh if i'm gonna play this

552.24 --> 557.92
on my desktop and then through obs is it

555.12 --> 557.92
actually gonna

558.32 --> 565.2
sound exactly like it's supposed to and

560.48 --> 565.2
yes it did so i hope you enjoyed that

566.0 --> 572.08
and i was also listening to

568.399 --> 574.0
well i just compared it to the newer

572.08 --> 576.64
jungle music because there is like a

574.0 --> 578.56
2013

576.64 --> 580.56
jungle

578.56 --> 583.3599999999999
that is like

580.56 --> 585.5999999999999
a direct parallel slash follow-up of the

583.36 --> 588.48
dubstep scene and it is like

585.6 --> 592.399
advanced jungle which is

588.48 --> 595.76
it's not the pure jungle of old

592.399 --> 597.6
but it is very interesting

595.76 --> 599.68
and it does remind me of that and i

597.6 --> 602.32
mixed like a whole thing that i ripped

599.68 --> 605.279
from an online

602.32 --> 607.6
music streaming site

605.279 --> 609.12
uh was it the the grand sound i'm

607.6 --> 612.24
subscribed to that you could find that

609.12 --> 612.24
in my subscription list

614.56 --> 618.2399999999999
i'll cut back to that steamy traveler

616.64 --> 619.8389999999999
hello

618.24 --> 621.44
but uh

619.839 --> 623.2
yeah

621.44 --> 625.44
i just found a whole bunch of songs

623.2 --> 627.839
together

625.44 --> 631.2790000000001
by listening looking at the title then

627.839 --> 633.6
searching for the song separately

631.279 --> 637.36
and then collecting it but before that

633.6 --> 640.32
there was basically like a a giant edit

637.36 --> 641.36
stream it's like a summary stream like

640.32 --> 643.36
things

641.36 --> 646.16
that have been very popular in the

643.36 --> 648.9590000000001
recent year and then they just some dj

646.16 --> 650.959
mixed it mixes it into one mix and i

648.959 --> 652.88
started to basically take one of those

650.959 --> 656.8
mixes that i thought was great and then

652.88 --> 659.04
cutting out or flat cutting as i call it

656.8 --> 660.88
the songs that i just thought sucked out

659.04 --> 664.399
of there

660.88 --> 666.88
and basically do like a surgical cut and

664.399 --> 668.56
hope to keep it fluid and did fairly

666.88 --> 672.399
well

668.56 --> 674.56
but yeah listen back to some of that

672.399 --> 678.8
so it was a kind of a mini party here

674.56 --> 678.8
saturday uh afternoon evening

678.88 --> 683.68
did i avoid copyright click yeah well it

681.76 --> 685.36
it seems like the show didn't get a

683.68 --> 687.04
copyright strike

685.36 --> 689.839
or a

687.04 --> 692.0
demonetization thing no i didn't get

689.839 --> 694.399
anything so i guess it was off the

692.0 --> 694.399
record

697.6 --> 702.32
oh i got a troll threat

700.48 --> 704.32
i hope this isn't your only source of

702.32 --> 706.88
income because you're gonna lose it for

704.32 --> 710.0790000000001
playing a song that is basically off the

706.88 --> 712.48
record from 93.

710.079 --> 712.4799999999999
okay

714.24 --> 719.36
that's like fearing getting a copyright

716.399 --> 720.16
strike for playing like super old donald

719.36 --> 721.6800000000001
duck

720.16 --> 724.0
cartoons

721.68 --> 724.0
really

725.76 --> 728.16
anyway

729.12 --> 732.9590000000001
yeah but nothing

730.88 --> 735.2
it seems like a youtube didn't really

732.959 --> 735.1999999999999
care

739.92 --> 745.5999999999999
fled arthur back and agreeing with me

743.519 --> 747.279
yeah what was that about again yeah flat

745.6 --> 749.36
arthur went

747.279 --> 751.6
went all weird on us

749.36 --> 753.839
that was kind of weird

751.6 --> 757.279
i don't remember exactly what what it

753.839 --> 759.44
was about again i think ether

757.279 --> 761.8389999999999
hey lorenzo barnes

759.44 --> 764.639
hello

761.839 --> 767.519
and turret306 could see you

764.639 --> 770.399
right but apology for q yeah it was just

767.519 --> 772.48
because of uh friday on the friday show

770.399 --> 774.56
steamy traveler

772.48 --> 776.0790000000001
in the after show after the recording

774.56 --> 778.16
stopped

776.079 --> 780.88
the conversation rolled kind of into

778.16 --> 781.76
quantum mechanics

780.88 --> 784.079
and

781.76 --> 786.48
like chocolate had dug up some questions

784.079 --> 790.1999999999999
somewhere about the

786.48 --> 790.2
so again the copenhagen

790.72 --> 795.6800000000001
method or something

792.8 --> 799.3599999999999
which is like an interpretation

795.68 --> 799.3599999999999
and we ask qe about it and

799.44 --> 803.12
and i guess i was a bit pushy when i did

801.6 --> 806.0790000000001
that because he got really pissed off

803.12 --> 808.5600000000001
and started ranting at me for a minute

806.079 --> 810.399
because i pressured him and i kind of

808.56 --> 812.8
because i was really curious in that

810.399 --> 815.839
moment like i was basically testing

812.8 --> 819.68
kiwi's cohesion and he had apparently

815.839 --> 819.6800000000001
not really done breakfast yet

820.88 --> 825.68
but he apologized for that saturday so

824.079 --> 829.199
yeah thanks

825.68 --> 832.079
i do respect that

829.199 --> 834.16
oh yeah god and that of [ __ ] happened

832.079 --> 836.4799999999999
dude hey len lenox

834.16 --> 838.959
dude whitsid got into the ball buster's

836.48 --> 840.72
chat yesterday and just

838.959 --> 842.8
he went full

840.72 --> 845.1990000000001
full blown full-blown savannah

842.8 --> 845.199
i like

845.92 --> 850.3199999999999
i've lost a lot of respect for wits it

848.0 --> 852.48
in the last few days

850.32 --> 854.48
i mean

852.48 --> 857.12
what good is stamina when everything you

854.48 --> 859.1990000000001
do is just stupid

857.12 --> 860.399
i mean yeah you know who else has

859.199 --> 862.56
stamina

860.399 --> 866.24
rumpus

862.56 --> 866.2399999999999
yes stamina too oh

866.72 --> 869.72
yeah

870.16 --> 874.7199999999999
hey classical homeopath

872.24 --> 877.279
but he was just constantly whining in

874.72 --> 879.76
the chat oh i'm being strong and i'm

877.279 --> 883.36
being strowman and i just started saying

879.76 --> 886.079
like uh i'm not having a debate with you

883.36 --> 887.12
with it i'm simply stating a couple of

886.079 --> 890.079
facts

887.12 --> 893.199
oh you're strumming me

890.079 --> 893.199
it's just [ __ ]

894.0 --> 899.839
i don't even know why you got a grinch

896.0 --> 899.839
in that chat but whatever

907.199 --> 912.639
ah can you explain to those of us who

909.44 --> 914.48
are complete idiots no no

912.639 --> 917.279
if you're a complete idiot

914.48 --> 917.279
it doesn't work

917.839 --> 922.0
the whole ether thing yeah the problem

920.0 --> 924.839
about ether is is it's the next

922.0 --> 927.839
aberration just like gravity

924.839 --> 930.48
huh you should have a

927.839 --> 932.72
and a slight understanding at least of

930.48 --> 934.8000000000001
the issues with gravity do don't you

932.72 --> 936.8000000000001
classify homeopath you know how

934.8 --> 939.92
convoluted it is you know kind of the

936.8 --> 942.3199999999999
history that's been dug up behind it

939.92 --> 942.3199999999999
well

942.8 --> 948.959
ether is kind of like that

945.04 --> 950.8
except a lot worse

948.959 --> 952.079
a lot worse

950.8 --> 954.4799999999999
because

952.079 --> 956.16
it's misunderstanding through the nature

954.48 --> 959.36
of light

956.16 --> 963.04
has been just widely spread even in the

959.36 --> 965.44
very lingo that describes the abilities

963.04 --> 968.079
and aspects of light

965.44 --> 970.48
it's like wave description in everything

968.079 --> 972.2399999999999
concerning light everything frequency

970.48 --> 974.639
oscillation

972.24 --> 977.16
wavelength everything about it is all

974.639 --> 979.6
described in waves

977.16 --> 981.8389999999999
semantically it is

979.6 --> 985.279
basically just a description to help you

981.839 --> 986.72
imagine sort of what's going on

985.279 --> 990.079
but it is all

986.72 --> 992.48
reified if you take it literally that

990.079 --> 994.079
that all means that it has to be away

992.48 --> 996.8000000000001
because it isn't

994.079 --> 1000.0
it's a real screw job in a way but it

996.8 --> 1002.0
could have been born out of simply

1000.0 --> 1004.959
not having another recourse i mean they

1002.0 --> 1006.56
were trying to identify light

1004.959 --> 1008.2399999999999
and they just like didn't know what the

1006.56 --> 1010.0
hell to do with it

1008.24 --> 1011.36
when they were figuring things out about

1010.0 --> 1014.0
it like what the hell is this

1011.36 --> 1016.399
diffraction cascade oh it must be a wave

1014.0 --> 1016.399
then

1017.92 --> 1023.759
and other things like yeah

1020.48 --> 1024.72
different frequency of light has another

1023.759 --> 1027.679
color

1024.72 --> 1029.679
it's another wavelength oh really really

1027.679 --> 1031.199
so there's literally weight no no no

1029.679 --> 1033.1200000000001
this is all

1031.199 --> 1036.72
just

1033.12 --> 1038.3999999999999
like this another description of what's

1036.72 --> 1040.72
going on

1038.4 --> 1042.48
to basically point out yeah a spectrum

1040.72 --> 1044.319
there's a spectrum there

1042.48 --> 1045.919
does it actually have to do with

1044.319 --> 1048.799
wavelength

1045.919 --> 1048.7990000000002
i don't think so

1049.84 --> 1053.6
right

1050.96 --> 1056.88
and and all of that

1053.6 --> 1057.76
has echoed on among physicists including

1056.88 --> 1058.96
like

1057.76 --> 1060.799
uh

1058.96 --> 1063.919
nikola tesla

1060.799 --> 1067.52
who were thinking about this

1063.919 --> 1070.4
they were thinking about it

1067.52 --> 1073.9189999999999
a lot and then speculate about ether but

1070.4 --> 1075.039
there has not been any individual in

1073.919 --> 1077.2800000000002
physics

1075.039 --> 1079.039
throughout history that has ever claimed

1077.28 --> 1080.8799999999999
the hypothesis

1079.039 --> 1082.96
because they know that doesn't make any

1080.88 --> 1085.3600000000001
sense

1082.96 --> 1088.0
i think that a lot of

1085.36 --> 1089.84
old physicists even figured out for

1088.0 --> 1091.919
themselves they probably didn't have a

1089.84 --> 1094.72
word for it they figured out that it is

1091.919 --> 1097.3600000000001
an aberration

1094.72 --> 1099.919
so they just talked about it a bit here

1097.36 --> 1102.4799999999998
and there but they never were like oh it

1099.919 --> 1105.48
has to be ether compliant

1102.48 --> 1105.48
now

1108.24 --> 1114.0
it is on the spectrum

1110.559 --> 1114.0
yeah it's getting a bit wavy

1120.16 --> 1124.0800000000002
it doesn't sound as bad as matt is

1121.84 --> 1126.08
attracting mass

1124.08 --> 1127.6
why not

1126.08 --> 1132.32
and besides

1127.6 --> 1132.32
gravity is not mass attracting mass

1132.799 --> 1137.84
huh huh aberration yeah oh yeah you

1135.919 --> 1140.72
people are made to believe it's mass

1137.84 --> 1144.559
attracting mass but that's like only

1140.72 --> 1147.679
the birth of its conception the story

1144.559 --> 1149.52
background it started with the idea of

1147.679 --> 1151.44
mass attracting mass that newton never

1149.52 --> 1153.039
claimed the hypothesis to

1151.44 --> 1155.3600000000001
and then later

1153.039 --> 1158.08
einstein came along

1155.36 --> 1160.799
and basically confirmed that yeah this

1158.08 --> 1163.6
is outdated it doesn't make sense but

1160.799 --> 1165.679
you like gravity well let me show you

1163.6 --> 1167.9189999999999
some bendy space time oh wait i can't

1165.679 --> 1170.24
actually show you but you can think of

1167.919 --> 1174.5590000000002
that i'm showing it to you

1170.24 --> 1174.559
by putting a ball on a sheet

1174.64 --> 1178.3200000000002
and now that's gravity oh it makes no

1176.32 --> 1179.9189999999999
sense oh you can't actually pinpoint

1178.32 --> 1183.039
yeah that's your freaking problem you

1179.919 --> 1183.039
want to believe in gravity

1183.679 --> 1185.919
right

1187.28 --> 1192.559
the observed phenomenon oh really

1190.32 --> 1196.32
naturally observed phenomenon where do

1192.559 --> 1196.32
you see that in nature thulium

1199.039 --> 1203.76
you don't

1201.6 --> 1205.52
mass doesn't attract mass besides what

1203.76 --> 1206.8799999999999
the hell is mass

1205.52 --> 1210.6399999999999
mass

1206.88 --> 1212.24
is an extracted value from density which

1210.64 --> 1214.64
is a real

1212.24 --> 1216.88
aspect of material

1214.64 --> 1218.8400000000001
mass isn't mass is merely a

1216.88 --> 1222.88
mathematically derived

1218.84 --> 1227.1999999999998
concept to which the original newtonian

1222.88 --> 1230.88
gravity mechanics are intricately tied

1227.2 --> 1233.679
but mass doesn't actually exist

1230.88 --> 1236.88
it's merely a derived concept it is not

1233.679 --> 1238.88
a thing and that derived concept does

1236.88 --> 1240.96
not attract

1238.88 --> 1243.6000000000001
itself

1240.96 --> 1245.679
it's ridiculous

1243.6 --> 1247.6399999999999
yeah and when you say mass goats toward

1245.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
the mass because it falls that's a

1247.64 --> 1252.0800000000002
presupposition that is

1249.84 --> 1254.08
hyper presuppositional

1252.08 --> 1255.52
besides you're not able to very

1254.08 --> 1257.4399999999998
manipulate

1255.52 --> 1260.1589999999999
that it does fall

1257.44 --> 1262.96
towards that huge mass

1260.159 --> 1266.7990000000002
it's [ __ ] and outdated thulium

1262.96 --> 1269.8400000000001
you're you're trying to re-wield a 2050

1266.799 --> 1271.9189999999999
level argument this is stupid

1269.84 --> 1273.6
it is a presupposition and it's not what

1271.919 --> 1275.8400000000001
you observe

1273.6 --> 1278.559
you're not observing a mass being

1275.84 --> 1281.84
attracted by another mass numpty [ __ ]

1278.559 --> 1281.84
you're presupposing it

1284.08 --> 1287.9189999999999
yeah we see things fall

1286.559 --> 1291.12
that's right

1287.919 --> 1293.5200000000002
what does that have to do with gravity

1291.12 --> 1293.52
nothing

1294.48 --> 1298.799
it's relative density disequilibrium

1296.88 --> 1300.7990000000002
it's an object whatever you're holding

1298.799 --> 1302.6399999999999
because it takes an object and not just

1300.799 --> 1306.0
air you're holding

1302.64 --> 1308.4
is denser than the medium it is in air

1306.0 --> 1310.48
so it's going to fall down if it would

1308.4 --> 1313.919
be less dense than a medium like a

1310.48 --> 1318.0
helium balloon it would go up

1313.919 --> 1321.039
gravity does not abide by those real

1318.0 --> 1321.039
world effects

1321.28 --> 1326.799
the mass attracting mass gravity

1323.28 --> 1329.12
conception it doesn't do that

1326.799 --> 1330.0
yet it happens in the real world just

1329.12 --> 1332.32
like

1330.0 --> 1334.72
if we were on a spinning ball we would

1332.32 --> 1336.96
see coriolis deviation with everything

1334.72 --> 1338.72
not attached to the earth

1336.96 --> 1341.039
yet we don't

1338.72 --> 1343.76
because the earth is not spinning and in

1341.039 --> 1346.1589999999999
that same fashion helium balloons go up

1343.76 --> 1347.52
because gravity is an outdated concept

1346.159 --> 1349.3600000000001
to which

1347.52 --> 1352.1589999999999
the original

1349.36 --> 1357.4799999999998
inventor did not

1352.159 --> 1357.48
connect any kind of hypothesis to

1360.88 --> 1363.8400000000001
so

1361.919 --> 1367.44
you need to get up to date with the flat

1363.84 --> 1371.1999999999998
earth debate thulium your reasoning is

1367.44 --> 1372.72
just vastly outdated it's really stupid

1371.2 --> 1375.8400000000001
and i'm gonna ban you if you keep

1372.72 --> 1375.84
spamming this [ __ ]

1376.0 --> 1381.36
get with the times you're outdated you

1378.799 --> 1384.24
haven't paid attention

1381.36 --> 1386.799
just regurgitating really stupid old

1384.24 --> 1389.52
outdated arguments i just handed you

1386.799 --> 1392.6399999999999
historical facts about them that should

1389.52 --> 1394.48
tell you this is not something that i

1392.64 --> 1396.64
should be defending

1394.48 --> 1399.6
there's no hypothesis claim

1396.64 --> 1402.96
yeah newton didn't claim a hypothesis

1399.6 --> 1405.28
einstein didn't claim a hypothesis you

1402.96 --> 1407.6000000000001
get it you numpty [ __ ]

1405.28 --> 1409.44
are you paying attention yet

1407.6 --> 1412.24
it's not real

1409.44 --> 1412.24
don't you get it

1415.6 --> 1421.52
different ideas yeah well i don't give a

1417.76 --> 1424.08
[ __ ] about your wonky little ideas that

1421.52 --> 1426.32
you made up when you were 12

1424.08 --> 1428.48
in school when you were presented with

1426.32 --> 1431.6789999999999
newtonian mechanics i don't give a [ __ ]

1428.48 --> 1433.039
what your ideas is as to what causes it

1431.679 --> 1435.039
i know

1433.039 --> 1437.6
what causes

1435.039 --> 1439.679
vertical displacement passive vertical

1437.6 --> 1443.52
displacement yeah it's called relative

1439.679 --> 1445.679
density theory scientifically proven and

1443.52 --> 1448.799
demonstrated theory

1445.679 --> 1452.0
very solid very reliable

1448.799 --> 1453.36
can get extremely complicated in setup

1452.0 --> 1456.48
and it's yet

1453.36 --> 1461.039
perfect in its predictable capacity

1456.48 --> 1462.64
perfect yeah gravity has no such thing

1461.039 --> 1465.039
no such thing

1462.64 --> 1467.679
there's just a standard formula for

1465.039 --> 1470.559
gravity an idea for this and you can

1467.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
mathematically apply this to simulations

1470.559 --> 1476.96
like architectural programs very easy

1473.84 --> 1480.0
just say uh just forced to go that way

1476.96 --> 1481.44
because you're not building with gases

1480.0 --> 1484.48
you're only going to be dealing with

1481.44 --> 1486.96
solids in architecture so yeah gravity

1484.48 --> 1488.799
as a mathematical tool formula works

1486.96 --> 1491.919
just fine

1488.799 --> 1494.48
but it isn't actually real within

1491.919 --> 1494.48
physics

1494.64 --> 1497.039
okay

1497.84 --> 1503.4399999999998
and i'm in a great mood actually

1501.6 --> 1505.9189999999999
it's just

1503.44 --> 1508.799
i have very little tolerance for

1505.919 --> 1510.7990000000002
severely outdated numty [ __ ] that

1508.799 --> 1514.0
won't shut the [ __ ] up and keep

1510.799 --> 1519.9189999999999
regurgitating outdated [ __ ]

1514.0 --> 1519.919
and don't respond to actual responses

1520.0 --> 1524.76
that concern those claims

1537.919 --> 1542.6000000000001
thulium doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's

1539.36 --> 1542.6
talking about

1547.44 --> 1550.559
what velocity

1550.88 --> 1553.6000000000001
what the hell does that have to do with

1552.32 --> 1556.3999999999999
anything

1553.6 --> 1559.1999999999998
no i'm not giving you a [ __ ] cookie

1556.4 --> 1560.64
cutter formula for relative density it's

1559.2 --> 1562.559
a description

1560.64 --> 1565.039
and it works every time you can

1562.559 --> 1566.96
physically do it it works every time now

1565.039 --> 1569.76
i bet there are people out there maybe

1566.96 --> 1572.0
tony's even gone and done it

1569.76 --> 1573.84
i think that adam meekin made the

1572.0 --> 1575.039
formula for it

1573.84 --> 1577.84
you can

1575.039 --> 1580.08
put it into typical math like formula

1577.84 --> 1581.279
the relative density system

1580.08 --> 1583.279
all of it

1581.279 --> 1584.559
you can do that

1583.279 --> 1586.88
yeah

1584.559 --> 1589.52
i don't really care

1586.88 --> 1591.679
i don't care about math at all and

1589.52 --> 1595.2
people that who show me the formula can

1591.679 --> 1597.44
go [ __ ] themselves up the ass with a

1595.2 --> 1601.3600000000001
spike dildo

1597.44 --> 1601.3600000000001
get it go [ __ ] yourself

1605.52 --> 1611.12
yeah because i'm not doing that [ __ ]

1608.24 --> 1613.1200000000001
i can describe how it works yeah because

1611.12 --> 1614.799
that is what the scientific method

1613.12 --> 1616.4799999999998
requires

1614.799 --> 1617.2
description

1616.48 --> 1619.919
not

1617.2 --> 1621.3600000000001
[ __ ] math formulas

1619.919 --> 1622.88
get it

1621.36 --> 1626.1589999999999
description

1622.88 --> 1627.679
you got to describe what it is what

1626.159 --> 1629.6000000000001
you're doing

1627.679 --> 1631.8400000000001
what you're gonna vary and manipulate

1629.6 --> 1635.9189999999999
you have to verbally describe it there

1631.84 --> 1637.12
will not have to be a single form of

1635.919 --> 1639.039
number

1637.12 --> 1640.9599999999998
involved

1639.039 --> 1642.72
in the scientific method do you

1640.96 --> 1644.08
understand that

1642.72 --> 1646.48
yeah

1644.08 --> 1647.84
and so i'm not doing it because i don't

1646.48 --> 1649.84
give a [ __ ]

1647.84 --> 1653.48
with your math obsession yeah i don't

1649.84 --> 1653.48
give a [ __ ] for that

1665.279 --> 1671.84
light has no speed thulium

1668.559 --> 1671.84
it's never been measured

1674.64 --> 1679.6000000000001
light is effectively instantaneous very

1678.0 --> 1681.6
mysterious though

1679.6 --> 1683.52
now you can

1681.6 --> 1685.12
i bet you yeah there's been a video i

1683.52 --> 1689.44
don't even know if that's tricked or not

1685.12 --> 1691.84
where they super slow mo cam

1689.44 --> 1693.919
some light

1691.84 --> 1696.72
but that doesn't actually prove that it

1693.919 --> 1700.0800000000002
has a speed it just proves

1696.72 --> 1700.08
light is really weird

1700.48 --> 1704.64
yeah

1701.6 --> 1707.1999999999998
you can't derive

1704.64 --> 1709.76
the speed of light

1707.2 --> 1712.0800000000002
from a very slow down

1709.76 --> 1714.1589999999999
setting where you have a couple of blips

1712.08 --> 1716.6399999999999
that seem to suggest that it might be

1714.159 --> 1718.0
traversing

1716.64 --> 1719.919
yeah

1718.0 --> 1722.64
because light doesn't

1719.919 --> 1725.039
it manifests it just

1722.64 --> 1726.64
it's there

1725.039 --> 1728.64
from beginning

1726.64 --> 1731.3600000000001
to end it's there

1728.64 --> 1733.039
instantaneous every time all light is

1731.36 --> 1734.24
instantaneous

1733.039 --> 1735.679
red light

1734.24 --> 1739.84
purple light

1735.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
blue light it's all instantaneous

1741.679 --> 1746.919
to be reloaded no it isn't

1744.559 --> 1749.44
it's science fiction speed of light is

1746.919 --> 1751.3600000000001
presuppositional science fiction it has

1749.44 --> 1753.039
never been measured within physical

1751.36 --> 1756.08
reality

1753.039 --> 1757.919
there's been calculations unleashed upon

1756.08 --> 1761.4399999999998
it

1757.919 --> 1763.8400000000001
yeah upon light supposedly it hasn't

1761.44 --> 1766.48
actually been measured it officially has

1763.84 --> 1768.1589999999999
never been measured

1766.48 --> 1769.52
i know this thanks to

1768.159 --> 1772.159
brian

1769.52 --> 1773.9189999999999
bryan's logic

1772.159 --> 1775.44
who's dug

1773.919 --> 1778.5590000000002
through this stuff

1775.44 --> 1780.96
and he stumbled upon that like it hasn't

1778.559 --> 1783.12
actually been measured and there's a

1780.96 --> 1785.279
supposed one-way speed of light and a

1783.12 --> 1786.7199999999998
two-way speed of light but it has never

1785.279 --> 1789.76
been measured

1786.72 --> 1793.1200000000001
it's all conceptual

1789.76 --> 1796.32
more nonsense coming out

1793.12 --> 1800.039
of the misunderstanding of light

1796.32 --> 1800.039
just like the ether

1828.88 --> 1832.64
yeah i got some cool water here

1833.44 --> 1836.76
some gusto

1842.4 --> 1846.799
[Music]

1843.76 --> 1849.039
no flondar i do not learn physics from

1846.799 --> 1851.36
brian and nathan

1849.039 --> 1855.36
but i and do enjoy

1851.36 --> 1857.9189999999999
speculating about physics with them

1855.36 --> 1860.399
and they do dig up things for me

1857.919 --> 1861.8400000000001
that i never knew because i never got

1860.399 --> 1864.2399999999998
there

1861.84 --> 1867.519
i learned physics in school and i

1864.24 --> 1871.6
graduated on it i know how physics is i

1867.519 --> 1875.36
know what it is i know how it works

1871.6 --> 1877.519
and i've learned a lot more about it now

1875.36 --> 1881.1999999999998
like more strictness to it i was

1877.519 --> 1883.2
confronted with the strictness in school

1881.2 --> 1885.3600000000001
safe to say at that age i didn't care

1883.2 --> 1887.1200000000001
for it all that much because i was a

1885.36 --> 1889.76
wild speculator

1887.12 --> 1891.76
right i was a typical baller i just was

1889.76 --> 1893.679
like no

1891.76 --> 1895.679
why does it have to be so strict why

1893.679 --> 1897.279
can't we just figure out how something

1895.679 --> 1899.039
works

1897.279 --> 1901.039
oh here and there and there this is why

1899.039 --> 1903.12
it's not a natural phenomenon i didn't

1901.039 --> 1905.76
understand what that actually meant back

1903.12 --> 1906.559
then i was just like ugh it's physics is

1905.76 --> 1908.64
like

1906.559 --> 1910.6399999999999
really complicated actually if you want

1908.64 --> 1913.1200000000001
to if you actually want to do something

1910.64 --> 1914.3990000000001
with it it's complicated

1913.12 --> 1916.799
right

1914.399 --> 1920.4799999999998
but i did learn

1916.799 --> 1924.0
back then i did graduate on it i just

1920.48 --> 1926.08
learned a lot more about it now

1924.0 --> 1929.039
rather than hanging around with guys and

1926.08 --> 1932.08
constantly talking about it

1929.039 --> 1935.12
like on a daily basis constantly talking

1932.08 --> 1937.279
about yeah you get a lot better then

1935.12 --> 1940.2399999999998
and research is done thanks to the

1937.279 --> 1942.159
internet which didn't exist back then

1940.24 --> 1943.919
when i went to school and learned that i

1942.159 --> 1946.64
didn't have the internet i had to learn

1943.919 --> 1949.44
everything from people and books

1946.64 --> 1952.72
internet is here now there is so much

1949.44 --> 1954.159
more reach to specific information

1952.72 --> 1956.3990000000001
i mean

1954.159 --> 1959.1200000000001
don't you realize that back then if you

1956.399 --> 1963.4399999999998
wanted to find a fact you would actually

1959.12 --> 1966.559
have to dig through a book now you just

1963.44 --> 1969.039
type in the word in the search engine

1966.559 --> 1971.6789999999999
and being it's right there

1969.039 --> 1974.1589999999999
i didn't have that luxury

1971.679 --> 1977.159
okay i didn't have that luxury 25 years

1974.159 --> 1977.159
ago

1984.88 --> 1989.2
okay julian

1986.96 --> 1991.3600000000001
get a freaking point or get the [ __ ] out

1989.2 --> 1994.559
dude

1991.36 --> 1998.1589999999999
stop saying no no no everything i've

1994.559 --> 2000.8799999999999
said is all meticulously researched and

1998.159 --> 2000.88
confirmed

2002.24 --> 2008.3990000000001
you can't backtrack reality

2005.679 --> 2009.679
i said it's true there has been no

2008.399 --> 2010.7199999999998
measured

2009.679 --> 2012.799
speed

2010.72 --> 2014.08
of light

2012.799 --> 2015.9189999999999
yeah

2014.08 --> 2019.1999999999998
and we're talking about

2015.919 --> 2021.44
physics departments around the world

2019.2 --> 2024.48
has been operating for

2021.44 --> 2027.1200000000001
a hundred years so yeah good luck with

2024.48 --> 2029.279
that no measured speed of light yeah in

2027.12 --> 2031.1999999999998
a hundred years

2029.279 --> 2032.799
you might want to make up your mind

2031.2 --> 2034.3990000000001
about it then

2032.799 --> 2036.399
wouldn't you say

2034.399 --> 2037.6789999999999
a hundred years no measured speed of

2036.399 --> 2040.32
light yeah

2037.679 --> 2042.3990000000001
plenty of physics departments yeah

2040.32 --> 2044.48
thousands and thousands and thousands of

2042.399 --> 2046.8799999999999
people dedicating their entire lives to

2044.48 --> 2049.599
physics no measured speed of light you

2046.88 --> 2052.56
get it your numpty [ __ ]

2049.599 --> 2054.159
it's not there it's not measured in 100

2052.56 --> 2055.7599999999998
years

2054.159 --> 2057.28
because you can't because it doesn't

2055.76 --> 2060.9190000000003
have a speed

2057.28 --> 2060.9190000000003
get over it

2061.919 --> 2065.0789999999997
all right

2079.119 --> 2081.359
um

2083.2 --> 2085.6789999999996
i have not time

2084.879 --> 2088.879
to

2085.679 --> 2091.2000000000003
waste on this [ __ ] for half an hour i'm

2088.879 --> 2091.2
sorry

2091.679 --> 2094.879
i do that sort of [ __ ] at the flight of

2093.52 --> 2097.68
debates

2094.879 --> 2099.7599999999998
i'm not gonna waste all my time dealing

2097.68 --> 2101.5989999999997
with the numpty [ __ ]

2099.76 --> 2106.6400000000003
that can't

2101.599 --> 2106.6400000000003
get beyond 2015. i can't deal with it

2106.88 --> 2110.6400000000003
they don't listen

2108.56 --> 2112.96
you just don't listen after i've

2110.64 --> 2114.72
explained everything

2112.96 --> 2117.359
everything you said i explained

2114.72 --> 2119.2799999999997
everything he didn't listen

2117.359 --> 2121.359
oh if you don't listen after all that

2119.28 --> 2125.2400000000002
time you're gonna get the [ __ ] out of my

2121.359 --> 2125.24
show you understand

2130.16 --> 2133.7599999999998
yeah sure it doesn't matter if he's a

2132.079 --> 2136.32
sock account at least he had something

2133.76 --> 2138.32
to say right at least he had something

2136.32 --> 2140.6400000000003
to say and he wasn't just whining or

2138.32 --> 2142.56
purely wasting my time by saying stupid

2140.64 --> 2144.72
[ __ ] that doesn't relate to anything i

2142.56 --> 2146.88
do appreciate a bit of inquiry with flat

2144.72 --> 2149.2
earth even as a baller

2146.88 --> 2151.6800000000003
but if i'm then gonna go off and

2149.2 --> 2155.2
actually be a flat earther give you the

2151.68 --> 2158.16
arguments and then you just don't listen

2155.2 --> 2161.7599999999998
that's gonna piss me off

2158.16 --> 2164.3199999999997
yeah i like inquiry i don't like not

2161.76 --> 2166.8
listening

2164.32 --> 2166.8
you see

2168.079 --> 2171.079
anyway

2172.16 --> 2175.04
hello elise g

2179.28 --> 2183.28
it's been rambling on in wells join

2192.72 --> 2197.839
yeah that's true territ

2195.52 --> 2202.0
i was kind of surprised that he would

2197.839 --> 2202.0
oversimplify it like that really weird

2206.88 --> 2210.7200000000003
right but he doesn't understand the

2209.28 --> 2213.3590000000004
mechanics that he learned he doesn't

2210.72 --> 2215.68
understand that newtonian mechanics

2213.359 --> 2217.04
is not actual physics

2215.68 --> 2220.16
it's

2217.04 --> 2222.96
subphysics it's

2220.16 --> 2224.7999999999997
newtonian mechanics mechanics very

2222.96 --> 2226.4
specific

2224.8 --> 2229.04
things

2226.4 --> 2232.1600000000003
it's its own sub

2229.04 --> 2232.16
field its own

2233.68 --> 2236.72
subject

2235.44 --> 2239.2000000000003
wait no

2236.72 --> 2240.839
you say that so it's not physics it's

2239.2 --> 2244.0
sub

2240.839 --> 2247.839
physics it's its own presupposed little

2244.0 --> 2249.839
thing newtonian mechanics it works great

2247.839 --> 2251.7599999999998
works just fine up until

2249.839 --> 2253.68
yeah you start to actually deal with

2251.76 --> 2255.6800000000003
gases and all that and then it doesn't

2253.68 --> 2257.68
really work at all

2255.68 --> 2259.7599999999998
because it doesn't take gas into account

2257.68 --> 2262.48
like the only way through newtonian

2259.76 --> 2264.2400000000002
mechanics any form of gas is even

2262.48 --> 2266.72
referenced

2264.24 --> 2268.9599999999996
is through air friction

2266.72 --> 2271.4399999999996
of things falling through air that's

2268.96 --> 2273.839
that's it that's all

2271.44 --> 2276.2400000000002
that's the only reference to anything

2273.839 --> 2277.599
gas related in the entirety of newtonian

2276.24 --> 2280.72
mechanics

2277.599 --> 2280.7200000000003
do you realize that

2281.359 --> 2288.16
because it's a sub physics model

2285.52 --> 2290.48
it's not complete it's just a thought

2288.16 --> 2292.0789999999997
experiment to

2290.48 --> 2295.839
basically explain a couple of

2292.079 --> 2295.8390000000004
rudimentary mechanics

2297.68 --> 2303.5989999999997
but it's not actual physics

2300.24 --> 2305.3999999999996
newton never actually claimed

2303.599 --> 2308.32
a valid

2305.4 --> 2311.119
physics-based hypothesis to his

2308.32 --> 2311.119
conceptions

2311.28 --> 2316.079
including gravity most predominantly

2314.079 --> 2319.04
gravity he wrote an entire letter about

2316.079 --> 2319.92
it about how he thinks it's ridiculous

2319.04 --> 2323.44
okay

2319.92 --> 2323.44
newton wrote that

2324.0 --> 2330.079
official historical document

2327.04 --> 2333.2799999999997
you got to deal with that

2330.079 --> 2335.28
mechanics is therefore physics no

2333.28 --> 2337.2000000000003
newtonian mechanics is not a part of

2335.28 --> 2341.1600000000003
physics it's sub

2337.2 --> 2341.16
physics it's not complete

2342.88 --> 2346.1600000000003
it doesn't take into account into

2344.96 --> 2347.68
account

2346.16 --> 2350.7999999999997
gases

2347.68 --> 2353.7599999999998
gas behavior it gas behavior is not a

2350.8 --> 2354.8
part of newtonian mechanics so it is not

2353.76 --> 2356.32
physics

2354.8 --> 2358.0
it's sub

2356.32 --> 2358.88
physics

2358.0 --> 2362.32
it's a

2358.88 --> 2363.599
presupposed little thought experiment

2362.32 --> 2364.88
within

2363.599 --> 2368.76
physics

2364.88 --> 2368.76
it is not physics

2386.64 --> 2390.56
right

2387.44 --> 2392.48
and i think newton even discovered

2390.56 --> 2397.56
what they were going to do

2392.48 --> 2400.079
cuz newton was living in the time where

2397.56 --> 2401.52
heliocentrism was getting rolled out by

2400.079 --> 2404.0
the church it was the time of

2401.52 --> 2406.48
protestants and

2404.0 --> 2409.119
and catholics

2406.48 --> 2410.72
going at it

2409.119 --> 2413.6800000000003
and

2410.72 --> 2416.3999999999996
yeah all these the astralis what is it

2413.68 --> 2417.48
the astronomer figures

2416.4 --> 2419.92
starting to

2417.48 --> 2422.8
supposedly go against the church when

2419.92 --> 2425.88
they were like the pawns of the church

2422.8 --> 2428.8
they were operators for the church yeah

2425.88 --> 2430.96
heliocentrism was invented

2428.8 --> 2434.4
and integrated

2430.96 --> 2436.88
and advertised by the freaking catholic

2434.4 --> 2438.88
church they created it

2436.88 --> 2442.1600000000003
yeah

2438.88 --> 2445.04
they were not like oh no how dare you

2442.16 --> 2448.3999999999996
contradict the old bible

2445.04 --> 2452.16
oh no no that's the people

2448.4 --> 2455.6800000000003
that were that yeah the church was yes

2452.16 --> 2458.0
yes the globe oh yes

2455.68 --> 2458.96
we're gonna mind control the [ __ ] out of

2458.0 --> 2462.079
these

2458.96 --> 2464.8
shitty dumb people yeah that's what they

2462.079 --> 2464.8
actually did

2464.96 --> 2471.28
yeah and newton was living allegedly

2467.92 --> 2473.76
according to history around that time

2471.28 --> 2477.92
so he could probably being a very smart

2473.76 --> 2480.7200000000003
man figure out that his mechanics

2477.92 --> 2483.04
were kind of being used and like oh they

2480.72 --> 2484.0789999999997
wanted to graft it in

2483.04 --> 2486.96
into

2484.079 --> 2489.119
into their ball mechanics right because

2486.96 --> 2491.44
newton didn't take into account gas

2489.119 --> 2493.359
behavior he didn't feel a need to do

2491.44 --> 2495.44
that

2493.359 --> 2497.2
probably and then it didn't work out

2495.44 --> 2499.119
when he tried probably if he even did

2497.2 --> 2500.96
try

2499.119 --> 2501.92
because you can't integrate it

2500.96 --> 2505.359
right

2501.92 --> 2508.0
but he probably figured out like wait

2505.359 --> 2511.7599999999998
they're gonna use my gravity

2508.0 --> 2513.68
to fantasize a model where

2511.76 --> 2516.3190000000004
everything sticks to a ball because of

2513.68 --> 2518.48
that gravity but that makes no sense

2516.319 --> 2520.8
because he probably knew about gas

2518.48 --> 2525.599
behavior he just didn't integrate it

2520.8 --> 2525.599
into his sub mechanics model

2526.24 --> 2530.72
yeah and then when he found out yeah

2528.72 --> 2532.48
well what do you think do you want to be

2530.72 --> 2534.9599999999996
part of the beasts

2532.48 --> 2536.88
of the monstrous illusion that's gonna

2534.96 --> 2538.2400000000002
fool people

2536.88 --> 2540.8
and like

2538.24 --> 2543.9199999999996
create mass hysteria and degenerate

2540.8 --> 2546.8
behavior no i don't think so he was a

2543.92 --> 2548.48
christian as far as i'm concerned

2546.8 --> 2551.3590000000004
so he probably was

2548.48 --> 2553.52
very repulsed by that notion that that

2551.359 --> 2555.119
could happen and i think that that is

2553.52 --> 2557.68
part of the reason why he wrote his

2555.119 --> 2558.7200000000003
letter so passionately towards that

2557.68 --> 2561.04
colleague

2558.72 --> 2563.2799999999997
about how it's absolutely preposterous

2561.04 --> 2566.48
to think that gravity is actually

2563.28 --> 2566.48
a valid hypothesis

2566.72 --> 2571.7599999999998
because he probably knew like holy [ __ ]

2569.2 --> 2574.72
they want to use my mechanics for their

2571.76 --> 2576.96
for their beast system illusion

2574.72 --> 2578.9599999999996
i don't want that i don't want to have

2576.96 --> 2581.28
my mechanics used in that i don't want

2578.96 --> 2583.28
to be part of the beast system

2581.28 --> 2585.44
i did it anyway

2583.28 --> 2588.44
or at least in schools

2585.44 --> 2588.44
right

2593.599 --> 2598.0
hey newton also wrote boyle about an

2596.16 --> 2600.319
ether concert really

2598.0 --> 2602.56
that's hilarious

2600.319 --> 2603.92
did he claim a hypothesis to it seeking

2602.56 --> 2607.319
star order i'm just gonna ask you

2603.92 --> 2607.319
straight out

2607.359 --> 2610.359
interesting

2632.48 --> 2635.48
this

2637.04 --> 2641.96
okay

2638.0 --> 2641.96
this is way too fast

2648.4 --> 2650.8
okay

2652.24 --> 2656.3999999999996
well thanks for the link it does look

2654.4 --> 2659.76
interesting it's just

2656.4 --> 2663.64
yeah too dry text for me to quickly

2659.76 --> 2663.6400000000003
figure out what it is

2680.96 --> 2688.28
nasa live chats disabled oh really they

2684.319 --> 2688.2799999999997
disable it now huh

2698.16 --> 2702.2
hey clutch good to see you

2708.96 --> 2716.4
oh man i'm getting hot again by the way

2712.16 --> 2716.3999999999996
oh i see why the cloud has gone away

2716.88 --> 2722.52
yes i think i'm opening this door

2735.52 --> 2740.56
being the hippie [ __ ] etherist okay

2744.0 --> 2748.8
are you what are you an etherist

2747.04 --> 2751.2
come on seeking

2748.8 --> 2752.2400000000002
i mean you can like it as a conception

2751.2 --> 2754.8799999999997
but

2752.24 --> 2757.68
you got to know that it's not real

2754.88 --> 2759.44
it's just a concept

2757.68 --> 2762.24
an aberration

2759.44 --> 2764.56
i mean have i not explained it well

2762.24 --> 2764.56
enough

2768.64 --> 2771.64
oh

2783.599 --> 2789.839
if you've read my terroid you know

2787.599 --> 2789.839
okay

2793.2 --> 2797.5989999999997
well i didn't read through the entire

2795.2 --> 2797.5989999999997
thing now

2798.0 --> 2802.319
i usually don't i just

2800.16 --> 2805.52
leave that too i'm gonna use it and then

2802.319 --> 2805.52
i'm gonna find out

2814.64 --> 2822.48
you flat earth or oh well yeah

2818.079 --> 2822.48
sure sure the flat earth said something

2824.16 --> 2828.56
there's a lot of flat earthers that say

2826.319 --> 2830.48
a lot of things

2828.56 --> 2833.119
and a lot of those things tend to be

2830.48 --> 2833.119
very dumb

2834.24 --> 2838.72
or just very

2836.4 --> 2840.64
short-term speculations that aren't

2838.72 --> 2842.72
really all that serious so i don't

2840.64 --> 2844.7999999999997
really care if you heard a flat earther

2842.72 --> 2847.04
say that sometime phil well i really

2844.8 --> 2849.8390000000004
don't care i don't say that

2847.04 --> 2854.68
nobody i know

2849.839 --> 2854.68
says that and really holds on to that

2869.52 --> 2872.559
there's not really anything to move on

2871.52 --> 2874.88
to there

2872.559 --> 2876.88
literally

2874.88 --> 2880.48
i mean that's not even a metaphorical

2876.88 --> 2883.92
statement that's a literal statement

2880.48 --> 2885.839
there is no ether and even ether as a

2883.92 --> 2889.52
concept

2885.839 --> 2889.52
is all about what isn't there

2891.28 --> 2897.28
you can never physically prove

2895.24 --> 2900.7999999999997
unmanifested things

2897.28 --> 2903.44
to attempt such a thing is about as

2900.8 --> 2905.76
useful as a dog trying to catch his own

2903.44 --> 2905.76
tail

2905.839 --> 2909.319
that is a metaphor

2916.0 --> 2920.48
ether is like god

2917.76 --> 2923.92
no it's an attempt of man

2920.48 --> 2925.04
to quantify god in that which is not

2923.92 --> 2928.559
there

2925.04 --> 2930.96
it's a highly materialistic born

2928.559 --> 2933.119
futile attempt

2930.96 --> 2936.319
to try to get something that you

2933.119 --> 2939.119
effectively deny in the first instance

2936.319 --> 2942.119
in order to get to that position that's

2939.119 --> 2942.119
either

2944.559 --> 2951.2000000000003
so yeah you could say ether is like god

2949.359 --> 2953.2799999999997
it's not literally though it's the

2951.2 --> 2956.7999999999997
materialistic

2953.28 --> 2958.6400000000003
summoning of god it's basically somebody

2956.8 --> 2961.599
denouncing god

2958.64 --> 2963.7599999999998
and like oh yeah but i actually do

2961.599 --> 2965.76
really need god but i can't allow myself

2963.76 --> 2967.44
to believe it so it's freaking ether

2965.76 --> 2969.44
then it's that thing that's not

2967.44 --> 2971.359
manifested that does everything and it's

2969.44 --> 2974.079
everywhere yeah that sounds kind of like

2971.359 --> 2974.0789999999997
god yeah

2974.72 --> 2981.9199999999996
right so it's just a substitute for god

2978.96 --> 2985.839
it is not god it's a substitute

2981.92 --> 2985.839
born out of materialist ignorance

2991.44 --> 2995.599
can you prove a sphere using a flat

2993.44 --> 2997.359
earth no

2995.599 --> 3000.8
but you need a flat earth to build a

2997.359 --> 3000.7999999999997
sphere earth model

3002.64 --> 3006.839
it's called the haversine formula

3024.48 --> 3027.92
yeah i thought you were probably

3026.0 --> 3030.319
addressing phil bell don't spend all

3027.92 --> 3031.28
your time on him in my chat

3030.319 --> 3034.64
please

3031.28 --> 3034.6400000000003
he's just distracting you

3038.72 --> 3042.16
ha

3039.839 --> 3044.0
that's really nice professor filwell

3042.16 --> 3046.319
whenever you fail at something you make

3044.0 --> 3048.48
progress both win and phil

3046.319 --> 3050.0
provides progress

3048.48 --> 3051.92
oh really

3050.0 --> 3054.079
what if you just make the same mistake

3051.92 --> 3056.96
over and over and over and over again

3054.079 --> 3059.2000000000003
your entire life and you just stick to

3056.96 --> 3061.44
doing the same thing over and over again

3059.2 --> 3064.0
do you make any progress then

3061.44 --> 3065.839
do you make any progress from your

3064.0 --> 3067.839
well fail

3065.839 --> 3071.2
and then fail and then fail and then

3067.839 --> 3073.2
fail and then fail again

3071.2 --> 3075.7599999999998
so professor filwell you might be the

3073.2 --> 3078.3999999999996
exception to that rule that you just

3075.76 --> 3078.4
shared with us

3079.599 --> 3084.319
because you only make progress when you

3081.68 --> 3086.319
actually learn from your failure by

3084.319 --> 3088.079
recognizing it's a failure and then

3086.319 --> 3089.44
correcting it

3088.079 --> 3091.92
if you're just going to make the same

3089.44 --> 3094.8
mistake over and over again

3091.92 --> 3097.839
that's called wasting your time

3094.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
not progress

3105.28 --> 3111.92
anyway i'm really loving this inner food

3107.92 --> 3113.76
[ __ ] i've had some this morning

3111.92 --> 3115.76
and it's great

3113.76 --> 3117.92
like since i've been trying this stuff i

3115.76 --> 3122.2400000000002
haven't felt sick

3117.92 --> 3124.2400000000002
like at all like not even a moment

3122.24 --> 3125.9199999999996
so these were definitely the greens i

3124.24 --> 3128.0
needed

3125.92 --> 3130.8
i'm glad i have so much of it

3128.0 --> 3134.559
and i hope that i can just

3130.8 --> 3136.6400000000003
kind of use it and then eventually

3134.559 --> 3138.559
that i'll have enough and then because i

3136.64 --> 3140.64
don't want to like need this stuff the

3138.559 --> 3142.559
rest of my life

3140.64 --> 3146.24
i hope it's just

3142.559 --> 3146.2400000000002
something i can do periodically

3146.96 --> 3149.52
good stuff

3151.04 --> 3155.04
yeah it is working well for me and it's

3152.559 --> 3157.8390000000004
so funny because i bought it

3155.04 --> 3162.92
like over a decade ago

3157.839 --> 3162.92
and effectively forgot it was even there

3166.8 --> 3173.119
i mean i took it with me

3169.2 --> 3173.1189999999997
moving four times

3174.4 --> 3177.52
that's how old it is

3179.119 --> 3182.319
oh wait three times

3183.28 --> 3188.559
what is that stuff you keep talking

3185.119 --> 3188.559
about it's called inner food

3191.52 --> 3198.4
it has it's basically freeze dried

3195.92 --> 3200.559
vegetables and

3198.4 --> 3202.7200000000003
plants

3200.559 --> 3204.3190000000004
relatively basic ones it's not super

3202.72 --> 3209.3999999999996
exotic

3204.319 --> 3209.4
but it just it really hits the spot

3213.599 --> 3217.839
so

3215.119 --> 3221.359
no wiener

3217.839 --> 3223.839
not wiener inner e-n-e-r

3221.359 --> 3223.839
food

3224.72 --> 3229.1189999999997
from inner health

3227.28 --> 3230.4
it's a bit weird the name but who gives

3229.119 --> 3232.0
a [ __ ]

3230.4 --> 3234.8
looks great

3232.0 --> 3238.24
and it's just free freeze dried

3234.8 --> 3238.2400000000002
vegetable powder that's it

3243.76 --> 3248.48
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

3246.16 --> 3248.48
thank

3248.64 --> 3252.5589999999997
is your computer fixed again nathan

3255.52 --> 3258.96
we missed you yesterday

3259.599 --> 3265.44
did you see by the way did you actually

3262.16 --> 3268.7999999999997
follow that show that you see with it

3265.44 --> 3268.8
going off in in chat

3271.04 --> 3274.5589999999997
oh okay

3272.319 --> 3278.92
fine

3274.559 --> 3278.92
went to the park today all right nice

3279.44 --> 3283.04
but did you see the show yesterday ball

3281.839 --> 3285.599
busters

3283.04 --> 3287.359
with wits it going completely ape [ __ ]

3285.599 --> 3291.6400000000003
in the chat

3287.359 --> 3291.64
i think you broke him or something

3295.119 --> 3300.559
i think that that that three and a half

3298.16 --> 3303.68
hour run thing you did i think it

3300.559 --> 3303.6800000000003
literally broke him

3304.0 --> 3307.839
spent the show trying to fix all right

3320.64 --> 3323.44
what the [ __ ]

3325.44 --> 3328.799
the hell is that kind of a remark man

3327.28 --> 3331.52
lenox

3328.799 --> 3331.52
bird flow

3331.68 --> 3335.5589999999997
what the [ __ ] the point

3337.839 --> 3344.0
what are you afraid of a virus len lenox

3341.599 --> 3346.96
can't be serious

3344.0 --> 3349.28
why would you be afraid

3346.96 --> 3351.28
of that

3349.28 --> 3353.44
unless like this bird is gonna

3351.28 --> 3355.599
physically attack you and wound you or

3353.44 --> 3357.68
something i mean yeah that's something i

3355.599 --> 3359.599
might be worried about

3357.68 --> 3362.72
but like why the hell would you be

3359.599 --> 3366.1600000000003
scared of freaking bird flu

3362.72 --> 3366.16
it's complete horseshit

3371.599 --> 3378.2400000000002
there was a letter posted oh really okay

3376.4 --> 3380.319
yeah oh i clearly don't get jokes at

3378.24 --> 3382.8799999999997
sarcasm yeah especially about things

3380.319 --> 3385.839
that i have not been a part of yeah no

3382.88 --> 3385.839
[ __ ] sherlock

3388.559 --> 3394.4
and besides even if that is a joke i

3391.04 --> 3394.4
think that's just why

3395.2 --> 3400.3999999999996
what if somebody that read that and

3397.839 --> 3404.48
didn't get that

3400.4 --> 3407.28
like i typically do per default

3404.48 --> 3410.2400000000002
shouldn't say that it's an incantation a

3407.28 --> 3412.96
bad one you shouldn't make jokes of

3410.24 --> 3415.359
things that don't exist like they do

3412.96 --> 3416.799
exist

3415.359 --> 3421.0
unless it's like in the middle of a

3416.799 --> 3421.0
conversation about it or something

3436.24 --> 3441.68
oh look terred i'm not treating len

3440.319 --> 3443.44
like a troll

3441.68 --> 3446.0
but i am correcting it because i don't

3443.44 --> 3448.64
want people to make jokes like that it's

3446.0 --> 3448.64
not funny

3450.96 --> 3457.68
best thing is to literally act like it

3454.24 --> 3459.68
does not exist because it doesn't

3457.68 --> 3462.3999999999996
just wipe it out

3459.68 --> 3466.8799999999997
get it viruses all that disease [ __ ]

3462.4 --> 3470.079
it doesn't exist so make it not exist

3466.88 --> 3471.6800000000003
erase it there's no need to know

3470.079 --> 3473.6800000000003
anything about it

3471.68 --> 3476.72
because it doesn't exist

3473.68 --> 3477.9199999999996
it's all horse [ __ ] it's all medical

3476.72 --> 3479.4399999999996
fraud

3477.92 --> 3484.04
that's persisted

3479.44 --> 3484.04
for a century and been weaponized

3494.079 --> 3500.48
yeah and by the way your ego

3497.28 --> 3500.48
that's not your

3501.599 --> 3504.1600000000003
that's actually

3502.96 --> 3506.7200000000003
just

3504.16 --> 3508.64
y-o-u-r

3506.72 --> 3511.64
anyway

3508.64 --> 3511.64
right

3521.44 --> 3526.559
i tend to be quite sarcastic dude yeah

3524.16 --> 3529.359
well i'm sorry to say i technically

3526.559 --> 3531.8390000000004
don't appreciate that

3529.359 --> 3534.24
i see it as like oh okay well that's

3531.839 --> 3535.68
your problem then

3534.24 --> 3538.5589999999997
i'm not gonna be like oh wow he's

3535.68 --> 3540.0
sarcastic so he can just do all that

3538.559 --> 3541.92
no

3540.0 --> 3544.64
just like if somebody's like depressed

3541.92 --> 3546.799
and mopey typically and they like to

3544.64 --> 3549.2799999999997
throw that out like their dirty laundry

3546.799 --> 3551.44
i don't accept that here

3549.28 --> 3554.4
right you can't complain you can say

3551.44 --> 3555.599
like i'm in a shitty situation

3554.4 --> 3559.2000000000003
if you're gonna be complaining because

3555.599 --> 3561.44
that's just the way you are then no

3559.2 --> 3561.4399999999996
no

3562.72 --> 3570.319
not saying that that's what you are but

3565.119 --> 3573.839
i don't typically appreciate sarcasm

3570.319 --> 3573.839
and i try to avoid it

3580.559 --> 3586.079
like in the pure form i mean you can

3583.28 --> 3588.48
actually integrate sarcasm in a very odd

3586.079 --> 3590.799
type of way where you can infuse it with

3588.48 --> 3593.2
positivity

3590.799 --> 3595.52
i've done that a lot

3593.2 --> 3596.5589999999997
especially when i'm like at jim bob's in

3595.52 --> 3598.96
chat

3596.559 --> 3602.4
it does inspire all kinds of

3598.96 --> 3602.4
mental gymnastics with me

3602.64 --> 3607.839
but just straight out sarcasm i i really

3605.44 --> 3610.079
try to avoid that

3607.839 --> 3612.24
because it's a spiritual thing it's not

3610.079 --> 3614.96
about even understanding the joke or

3612.24 --> 3617.2799999999997
something it's about a spiritual thing

3614.96 --> 3620.16
that happens

3617.28 --> 3620.1600000000003
it's not good

3622.4 --> 3629.079
it's like the slow poisoning of a well

3625.52 --> 3629.079
when you do that

3633.68 --> 3636.68
anyway

3642.96 --> 3647.2
i mean by all means if i'm like in the

3644.88 --> 3649.28
middle of a joking situation or

3647.2 --> 3652.0789999999997
something and i'm laughing out loud yeah

3649.28 --> 3655.0400000000004
you can sneak in a sarcastic remark or

3652.079 --> 3656.6400000000003
something because then it's like already

3655.04 --> 3659.04
a joking mood

3656.64 --> 3661.2
but don't do that like in the middle of

3659.04 --> 3664.72
a serious situation it is highly

3661.2 --> 3664.72
confusing and frustrating

3665.76 --> 3668.76
anyway

3678.079 --> 3684.04
weird little micro flies i don't even

3680.48 --> 3684.04
know what they are

3710.72 --> 3714.16
ah thank you ptcnet

3716.72 --> 3719.1189999999997
i know

3724.16 --> 3729.359
it's it's just typical that

3727.119 --> 3731.92
in group dynamics

3729.359 --> 3734.88
if there's sarcasm introduced

3731.92 --> 3736.64
that literally depletes creative energy

3734.88 --> 3739.96
did you know that

3736.64 --> 3739.96
that's universal

3746.24 --> 3750.72
so it's also because of the group

3747.92 --> 3754.2400000000002
dynamics because if it was just me in

3750.72 --> 3756.24
the loan then yeah basically

3754.24 --> 3759.2799999999997
be much more free to do whatever but

3756.24 --> 3763.2799999999997
we're a group dynamic this is a workshop

3759.28 --> 3764.2400000000002
and sarcasm always depletes creative

3763.28 --> 3765.52
energy

3764.24 --> 3768.16
it does

3765.52 --> 3770.48
palpably test it test it for yourself

3768.16 --> 3772.72
like even watching something where

3770.48 --> 3775.839
sarcasm is inserted

3772.72 --> 3779.52
it always does that sarcasm is a

3775.839 --> 3783.24
destroyer of creative energy

3779.52 --> 3783.24
it depletes you

3796.72 --> 3801.839
you're not in this here yeah good five

3798.319 --> 3803.7599999999998
roads i don't recommend it

3801.839 --> 3806.0789999999997
it's a lot of waste of time and you

3803.76 --> 3807.8390000000004
probably end up very very triggered like

3806.079 --> 3811.6400000000003
what's it gets it

3807.839 --> 3811.64
who doesn't get it

3814.559 --> 3820.48
it takes creativity to be sarcastic yeah

3817.44 --> 3822.7200000000003
yeah maybe you're right

3820.48 --> 3822.72
yeah

3823.599 --> 3832.0
but it also then depletes the energy of

3827.44 --> 3832.0
that creativity when you do it

3836.799 --> 3841.68
and i can be sarcastic

3839.2 --> 3843.359
actually within direct verbal social

3841.68 --> 3847.2
interaction

3843.359 --> 3851.319
i employ a lot of minor

3847.2 --> 3851.319
sarcastic elements

3852.4 --> 3858.559
but i don't just make singular sarcastic

3855.44 --> 3859.76
remarks in a chat

3858.559 --> 3860.96
they only

3859.76 --> 3863.6800000000003
employ it

3860.96 --> 3867.76
when i'm verbally communicating

3863.68 --> 3869.2799999999997
yeah so i know yeah and use it sparingly

3867.76 --> 3872.7990000000004
you know why

3869.28 --> 3874.88
because if i use it too much it depletes

3872.799 --> 3877.44
the energy

3874.88 --> 3880.559
i don't want that to happen i don't want

3877.44 --> 3882.7200000000003
to suck you guys dry

3880.559 --> 3885.92
i want to actually

3882.72 --> 3886.799
help you nourish that energy so i avoid

3885.92 --> 3889.039
it

3886.799 --> 3893.119
as much as i can

3889.039 --> 3896.559
only use it in very minor ways for

3893.119 --> 3896.559
theatrical purposes

3902.96 --> 3906.4
yeah

3904.559 --> 3908.7200000000003
it's green yeah and i like the creepy

3906.4 --> 3910.7200000000003
sarcastic turret

3908.72 --> 3913.52
i mean when i go ragewin there's

3910.72 --> 3916.16
definitely creepy sarcasm there

3913.52 --> 3916.16
definitely

3918.24 --> 3923.799
if i'm not just straight out going for

3920.64 --> 3923.799
the target

3933.44 --> 3937.599
right

3935.52 --> 3938.72
but when i do that

3937.599 --> 3941.76
it's

3938.72 --> 3944.3999999999996
a much more intense situation and much

3941.76 --> 3947.28
harder to misinterpret because i'm

3944.4 --> 3951.839
literally on camera verbally doing it

3947.28 --> 3951.8390000000004
and not just typing a sentence in a chat

3964.4 --> 3968.4
i think a lot of my sense of humor came

3966.079 --> 3969.599
from red dwarf

3968.4 --> 3971.2000000000003
right

3969.599 --> 3974.2400000000002
well look

3971.2 --> 3975.68
it just means you have nerd traits

3974.24 --> 3978.3999999999996
nerds have

3975.68 --> 3980.5589999999997
typical predisposition for sarcasm

3978.4 --> 3982.799
but that's also because of the isolation

3980.559 --> 3984.079
factor of being a nerd

3982.799 --> 3985.7599999999998
right

3984.079 --> 3987.2000000000003
and again

3985.76 --> 3991.6800000000003
depleting

3987.2 --> 3993.1189999999997
energy has a function a social function

3991.68 --> 3995.2
why do you do it

3993.119 --> 3997.44
because you

3995.2 --> 3997.4399999999996
you

3998.24 --> 4001.0389999999998
are stuck

4000.079 --> 4003.3590000000004
people

4001.039 --> 4005.28
apply sarcasm kind of because they're

4003.359 --> 4008.0
socially stuck

4005.28 --> 4010.0
and they do it to drain the energy of

4008.0 --> 4014.559
people surrounding them

4010.0 --> 4014.559
so they don't get overwhelmed

4015.119 --> 4020.1600000000003
yeah

4017.2 --> 4022.64
that's how your intuition uses it when

4020.16 --> 4024.64
you've allowed yourself to dabble in

4022.64 --> 4027.52
sarcasm or you think it's really funny

4024.64 --> 4031.359
you start to try and apply it

4027.52 --> 4033.52
especially when you're young you do it

4031.359 --> 4035.92
to deplete

4033.52 --> 4038.72
the other people so you do not get

4035.92 --> 4038.7200000000003
overwhelmed

4039.52 --> 4046.119
that's how i used it

4042.0 --> 4046.119
and i overused it too

4048.0 --> 4050.559
i was young

4050.96 --> 4056.16
and that depletion effect is absolutely

4054.24 --> 4059.0389999999998
there

4056.16 --> 4059.0389999999998
it's palpable

4060.559 --> 4063.8390000000004
i've had people tell me could you please

4062.48 --> 4065.76
stop do that

4063.839 --> 4068.0789999999997
it's like making us miserable could you

4065.76 --> 4069.8390000000004
please stop being sarcastic now

4068.079 --> 4071.92
and it would be like what

4069.839 --> 4073.68
i didn't even know it when it happened

4071.92 --> 4075.6800000000003
when i was in that mood i would just do

4073.68 --> 4079.7599999999998
it do it do it automatically not even

4075.68 --> 4079.7599999999998
realizing that i was being sarcastic

4082.319 --> 4087.0389999999998
and was not pleasant

4084.4 --> 4090.48
it is kind of miserable anyway

4087.039 --> 4091.76
there's a very funny episode about

4090.48 --> 4095.359
sarcasm

4091.76 --> 4096.96
in south park too called sarcastical

4095.359 --> 4098.799
i recommend you watch it if you're

4096.96 --> 4099.92
interested in what i just had to say

4098.799 --> 4102.64
about it

4099.92 --> 4104.319
because there's some good gravy in that

4102.64 --> 4106.159000000001
episode

4104.319 --> 4108.799
and some grossness of course but it's

4106.159 --> 4108.799
south park

4114.0 --> 4118.4
you guys still on

4116.159 --> 4122.2789999999995
professor phil bell you know he's never

4118.4 --> 4122.2789999999995
gonna answer a question

4132.96 --> 4137.359
well tara

4134.48 --> 4140.239
look if professor phil bell

4137.359 --> 4143.759
is not going to defend ether

4140.239 --> 4145.5199999999995
sounds like a very wise choice to me

4143.759 --> 4147.199
sounds like he knows when he's in over

4145.52 --> 4149.1990000000005
his head

4147.199 --> 4152.0
and and he doesn't need it he doesn't

4149.199 --> 4153.759
need it for his ball

4152.0 --> 4158.44
belief

4153.759 --> 4158.44
yeah baseline he doesn't need it

4160.159 --> 4163.159
what

4176.239 --> 4180.879999999999
okay i guess you guys are now having

4177.839 --> 4184.08
your own hangout in chat fine

green goo

4191.199 --> 4196.2789999999995
it literally tastes like grass

4202.8 --> 4209.04
although it doesn't taste as super gross

4205.28 --> 4212.5199999999995
as it did the first time i tried that

4209.04 --> 4212.5199999999995

4321.92 --> 4326.84
naturally occurring phenomenon

4325.36 --> 4329.5199999999995
in in a

4326.84 --> 4331.92
claim how can you falsify something that

minute

4389.52 --> 4394.0
ether was mainstream

4391.679 --> 4398.08
some time ago yeah mainstream

4394.0 --> 4399.84
philosophical [ __ ]

4398.08 --> 4404.32
yeah

4399.84 --> 4407.4400000000005
not scientific hypothesis based

4404.32 --> 4409.92
or or did you not know that

4407.44 --> 4412.799999999999
professor filwell

4409.92 --> 4414.8
what's the hypothesis for ether

4412.8 --> 4416.159000000001
what's the naturally occurring

4414.8 --> 4418.56
phenomenon

4416.159 --> 4421.199
that you as the experimenter can very

4418.56 --> 4421.1990000000005
manipulate

4423.04 --> 4426.56
okay

4424.64 --> 4430.280000000001
because we feel about clearly has like a

4426.56 --> 4430.280000000001
very long delay

4475.44 --> 4481.96
actually it was

4478.64 --> 4481.96
what was

4482.32 --> 4486.44
what are you talking about now

4516.08 --> 4518.4
hello

4522.56 --> 4527.120000000001
it's really weird thing look

4524.8 --> 4528.88
professor phil if you're gonna get in my

4527.12 --> 4531.44
chat and tell me it's been mainstream

4528.88 --> 4534.64
for quite some time and then i

4531.44 --> 4536.08
proceed to ask you okay so what if it's

4534.64 --> 4538.8
science

4536.08 --> 4539.92
mainstream you say so science mainstream

4538.8 --> 4542.88
science

4539.92 --> 4545.28
what's the hypothesis

4542.88 --> 4548.64
and you don't respond

4545.28 --> 4551.44
so maybe it's not really mainstream then

4548.64 --> 4552.96
or not within physics anyway right maybe

4551.44 --> 4555.44
it's just

4552.96 --> 4557.679
a little thingy a little

4555.44 --> 4558.639999999999
conception that people like to ponder

4557.679 --> 4562.159
upon

4558.64 --> 4563.280000000001
play around with in their minds

4562.159 --> 4565.839999999999
yeah

4563.28 --> 4569.759999999999
because it's just an idea there is no

4565.84 --> 4569.76
physical proof for any of it

4571.199 --> 4574.199
[ __ ]

4588.239 --> 4593.849999999999
died

4590.78 --> 4593.849999999999
[Music]

4597.04 --> 4599.36
wow

4601.12 --> 4604.679
there it is

4608.32 --> 4611.44
really

4610.0 --> 4612.88
so

4611.44 --> 4615.04
i take it that

4612.88 --> 4617.28
the medium

4615.04 --> 4618.32
is the naturally occurring phenomena

4617.28 --> 4621.5199999999995
you're gonna

4618.32 --> 4623.679
manipulate as the experimenter in order

4621.52 --> 4626.080000000001
for a light to propagate or not

4623.679 --> 4628.8
propagate

4626.08 --> 4631.04
how did you turn off the ether in order

4628.8 --> 4633.1990000000005
to prove that

4631.04 --> 4635.04
it is the thing needed for light to

4633.199 --> 4637.759999999999
propagate professor filbell could you

4635.04 --> 4640.96
explain that to me

4637.76 --> 4646.6
since you actually dared to usher the

4640.96 --> 4646.6
word hypothesis in your sentence there

4659.36 --> 4664.4
yeah fiberot does seem like he's an

4661.36 --> 4666.96
aetherian after all

4664.4 --> 4666.96
it's just

4675.28 --> 4678.679
not whose

4679.76 --> 4686.0
he literally said the hypothesis

4684.08 --> 4689.12
that means that he claims that it is a

4686.0 --> 4692.32
hypothesis whatever he's referencing

4689.12 --> 4695.04
i don't give a [ __ ] if he did not write

4692.32 --> 4696.32
it originally that's not what this is

4695.04 --> 4699.32
about

4696.32 --> 4699.32
numpty

4710.0 --> 4715.04
michaelson morally

4712.719 --> 4718.96
paper oh it's very wise of you not to

4715.04 --> 4718.96
call that an experiment because it isn't

4719.36 --> 4723.92
yeah

4720.64 --> 4727.04
so how did you very manipulate the ether

4723.92 --> 4728.32
in order for a light to propagate or not

4727.04 --> 4731.679
propagate

4728.32 --> 4734.32
using mickelson morley paper professor

4731.679 --> 4737.36
phil bell who claimed a hypothesis was

4734.32 --> 4738.88
involved with ether

4737.36 --> 4741.12
how are you going to do that then how

4738.88 --> 4744.0
are you going to utilize the knowledge

4741.12 --> 4746.8
of the mickelson morally test

4744.0 --> 4749.28
to vary and manipulate ether in order to

4746.8 --> 4752.0
prove that it is the cause

4749.28 --> 4755.0
of light propagating

4752.0 --> 4755.0
go

4764.159 --> 4768.48
dude

4766.08 --> 4771.36
oh god

4768.48 --> 4775.48
he did he literally said stop lying your

4771.36 --> 4775.48
sock troll piece of [ __ ]

4799.199 --> 4802.199
ah

4806.96 --> 4812.4800000000005
their paper excribes the experiment oh

4810.159 --> 4812.48
really

4813.12 --> 4819.32
okay can you tell us about it

4815.6 --> 4819.320000000001
about this experiment

4820.32 --> 4825.679
what was the independent variable

4822.88 --> 4828.639
was it a naturally occurring phenomena

4825.679 --> 4830.88
did they vary and manipulate it in order

4828.639 --> 4834.96
to prove the cause

4830.88 --> 4834.96
of the effect that they presumed

4835.04 --> 4842.28
or are you still just colloquially

4837.44 --> 4842.28
blabbering like an outdated [ __ ]

4854.4 --> 4857.599999999999
yeah

4855.44 --> 4860.239
you bringing forth that paper is not

4857.6 --> 4861.1990000000005
gonna get you off the hook don't you get

4860.239 --> 4863.759999999999
it

4861.199 --> 4867.04
yeah it's not gonna work you see you are

4863.76 --> 4868.8
not my teacher i'm not in your class you

4867.04 --> 4872.239
can't just say

4868.8 --> 4874.639
read this paper to get an hour off or

4872.239 --> 4878.0
something yeah you're in my chat

4874.639 --> 4882.0
you made the claim you say it's there so

4878.0 --> 4884.32
you then deliver verbally in the chat

4882.0 --> 4887.36
using text

4884.32 --> 4889.12
what about it yeah

4887.36 --> 4891.44
you don't just say oh no you just have

4889.12 --> 4894.08
to read it it's in there yeah we've had

4891.44 --> 4896.08
that little trixie from ballers and

4894.08 --> 4897.679
anti-flat earthers for years yeah it's

4896.08 --> 4900.4
not gonna work

4897.679 --> 4902.719
if you know there's something there

4900.4 --> 4904.239
yeah that's relevant to the discussion

4902.719 --> 4907.36
then you

4904.239 --> 4910.759999999999
type it out

4907.36 --> 4910.759999999999
you get it

4926.719 --> 4931.159
okay great thanks for that

4939.12 --> 4944.48
so i don't refer to it

4942.08 --> 4945.84
it might work with light that's very

4944.48 --> 4947.839999999999
wise of you

4945.84 --> 4950.56
then why the hell did you claim that

4947.84 --> 4952.639
there even is an experiment to prove

4950.56 --> 4954.719
either

4952.639 --> 4956.84
are you backtracking now

4954.719 --> 4959.92
are you saying oh wait wait

4956.84 --> 4962.8
um maybe i just got carried away and i

4959.92 --> 4966.4
was just completing complete horseshit

4962.8 --> 4966.400000000001
like all the other ethereans

4966.8 --> 4970.84
is that what that was professor phil

4968.719 --> 4974.2390000000005
bell because yeah it is very

4970.84 --> 4977.12
wise to not actually claim

4974.239 --> 4979.678999999999
evidence scientific lines

4977.12 --> 4982.4
for ether

4979.679 --> 4984.88
you did do that however

4982.4 --> 4988.159
several times in the chat

4984.88 --> 4990.4800000000005
even use the word hypothesis

4988.159 --> 4990.48
yeah

4990.8 --> 4995.76
but i guess you just now figured out

4993.679 --> 4998.4
that that doesn't work

4995.76 --> 5000.719
so you now say there is no evidence for

4998.4 --> 5003.36
ether very wise of you because there

5000.719 --> 5005.36
isn't there's no hypothesis

5003.36 --> 5007.92
no naturally occurring phenomenon that

5005.36 --> 5011.759999999999
you can very manipulate in order to

5007.92 --> 5016.2390000000005
prove that it exists or causes anything

5011.76 --> 5018.2390000000005
yeah mainly the perpetuation of light

5016.239 --> 5020.5599999999995
there's nothing you can very manipulate

5018.239 --> 5023.919999999999
in order to prevent light from being

5020.56 --> 5023.92
able to do what it does

5024.639 --> 5026.8
yeah

5025.44 --> 5029.5199999999995
you can't

5026.8 --> 5031.679
just prevent light from going wherever

5029.52 --> 5033.76
it's going to go

5031.679 --> 5035.04
the only way to do that is to physically

5033.76 --> 5037.4400000000005
obstruct it

5035.04 --> 5039.36
there's no other way to stop light other

5037.44 --> 5042.32
than physical obstruction and

5039.36 --> 5045.199
effectively absorption into matter yeah

5042.32 --> 5047.12
absorption into matter is the only way

5045.199 --> 5050.5599999999995
to stop lying

5047.12 --> 5054.0
because it doesn't have a medium

5050.56 --> 5057.1990000000005
that it needs in order to be what people

5054.0 --> 5058.96
think it is

5057.199 --> 5062.48
it's not a wave

5058.96 --> 5063.28
it's not a secondary effect

5062.48 --> 5065.919999999999
like

5063.28 --> 5069.12
the ocean ripples

5065.92 --> 5071.12
like actual waves or sound waves

5069.12 --> 5074.32
it isn't that

5071.12 --> 5076.239
it's just been mistakenly interpreted as

5074.32 --> 5077.5199999999995
such

5076.239 --> 5079.36
through the

5077.52 --> 5081.92
wave function

5079.36 --> 5084.5599999999995
description

5081.92 --> 5086.88
that comes out of diffraction cascade

5084.56 --> 5088.2390000000005
from the double slit

5086.88 --> 5091.28
tests

5088.239 --> 5092.959999999999
yeah it's not a way it just has a very

5091.28 --> 5097.599999999999
unique ability

5092.96 --> 5098.4800000000005
to diffract in more than three bands

5097.6 --> 5100.88
and

5098.48 --> 5102.159
when deriving a pattern from this

5100.88 --> 5104.0
diffraction

5102.159 --> 5106.32
people came to the mathematical

5104.0 --> 5108.4
conclusion well this is just like as if

5106.32 --> 5109.199
it had been a wave

5108.4 --> 5112.08
yeah

5109.199 --> 5114.4
but it isn't

5112.08 --> 5117.36
very specifically

5114.4 --> 5117.36
isn't a wave

5118.56 --> 5123.14
are you getting it

5120.0 --> 5123.14
[Music]

5123.679 --> 5126.679
uh

5167.199 --> 5170.879999999999
what murder in a vacuum there is no

5168.88 --> 5172.0
perfect vacuum

5170.88 --> 5174.8
and light

5172.0 --> 5176.0
can travel perfectly through a vacuum

5174.8 --> 5179.12
perfectly

5176.0 --> 5181.04
just because you cannot see it travel

5179.12 --> 5183.199
there doesn't mean

5181.04 --> 5185.12
travel is even a big word

5183.199 --> 5186.638999999999
transverse

5185.12 --> 5189.44
manifest

5186.639 --> 5194.0
it can manifest through vacuum easily

5189.44 --> 5196.48
even more easily than through gas

5194.0 --> 5198.96
actual gas pressure because

5196.48 --> 5202.08
matter absorbs light

5198.96 --> 5205.199
decreases its energy output

5202.08 --> 5208.0
also reflects it so that you might see

5205.199 --> 5209.5199999999995
the light reflecting off including gas

5208.0 --> 5212.56
like a laser

5209.52 --> 5215.360000000001
to see where the laser beam

5212.56 --> 5217.04
is actually going yeah just because you

5215.36 --> 5219.36
can't see it anymore because it's not

5217.04 --> 5221.679
reflecting of any particles in that

5219.36 --> 5224.32
location doesn't mean that oh no it

5221.679 --> 5226.08
doesn't exist no it does [ __ ] exist

5224.32 --> 5230.44
it's right there you just can't see it

5226.08 --> 5230.44
because it's not reflecting of anything

5243.44 --> 5246.638999999999
what makes it go through

5247.12 --> 5252.88
what makes it it's light it goes through

5250.32 --> 5254.719
it manifests being it's right there it

5252.88 --> 5257.679
has the room

5254.719 --> 5261.36
it manifests it just goes

5257.679 --> 5264.8
it doesn't need anything to push it

5261.36 --> 5267.5199999999995
forward or to go through something

5264.8 --> 5270.96
because it's not a wave it's a beam

5267.52 --> 5273.76
and it instantaneously manifests

5270.96 --> 5277.679
bing it's there it doesn't need anything

5273.76 --> 5279.84
to go through all it needs is room

5277.679 --> 5282.56
room

5279.84 --> 5286.08
well transparency so it can actually

5282.56 --> 5288.320000000001
keep manifesting through

5286.08 --> 5290.88
it doesn't move

5288.32 --> 5293.04
it manifests and all it needs is some

5290.88 --> 5298.2390000000005
room to manifest

5293.04 --> 5298.239
before eventually it gets absorbed

5299.12 --> 5303.199
completely by the matter

5301.28 --> 5307.04
that's what happens

5303.199 --> 5309.678999999999
it doesn't need anything to move

5307.04 --> 5313.719
it just manifests

5309.679 --> 5313.719
bing it's right there

5337.199 --> 5343.12
i wouldn't repeal to god saying it being

5340.0 --> 5346.08
the proof the proof is right there

5343.12 --> 5348.719
you can test light it just manifests it

5346.08 --> 5352.239
doesn't need anything

5348.719 --> 5354.719
to manifest through

5352.239 --> 5355.638999999999
except for clear

5354.719 --> 5357.199
space

5355.639 --> 5359.4400000000005
non-opaque

5357.199 --> 5362.159
matter to go through

5359.44 --> 5363.759999999999
or the lack thereof which is also not

5362.159 --> 5365.92
opaque right

5363.76 --> 5367.679
transparent it needs transparency to

5365.92 --> 5369.76
manifest

5367.679 --> 5372.2390000000005
that's all it just needs transparency

5369.76 --> 5374.159000000001
and then the light can manifest

5372.239 --> 5376.959999999999
and if there's something opaque then the

5374.159 --> 5379.28
opaque matter which it will always be

5376.96 --> 5380.88
matter there's not non-matter that is

5379.28 --> 5381.679
opaque

5380.88 --> 5383.679
right

5381.679 --> 5386.159
matter it's always if it's opaque it's

5383.679 --> 5389.04
always matter of some form if it's

5386.159 --> 5391.679
opaque then it will prevent

5389.04 --> 5393.44
the manifestation of light from going

5391.679 --> 5396.56
through there because it will be

5393.44 --> 5400.12
absorbed and reflected

5396.56 --> 5400.120000000001
that's what happens

5432.48 --> 5435.48
hmm

5453.28 --> 5458.28
man i'm getting really hungry by the way

5481.6 --> 5488.04
that's a good one

5483.679 --> 5488.04
that that is a good one

5494.96 --> 5501.56
that's a really witty word

5497.84 --> 5501.56
thank you for that fibroids

5517.6 --> 5522.08
all right yeah i'm sure professor phil

5519.76 --> 5523.84
bell you make a lot of money

5522.08 --> 5525.92
so you don't give a [ __ ] about what

5523.84 --> 5528.0
reality is because in the end you have

5525.92 --> 5529.12
more money than other people that's a

5528.0 --> 5530.639
great

5529.12 --> 5533.36
get great

5530.639 --> 5535.52
standpoint to have especially when it

5533.36 --> 5538.32
comes to debates i mean that's going to

5535.52 --> 5541.6
really help you win the argument there

5538.32 --> 5545.199
i mean you got more money yeah

5541.6 --> 5545.1990000000005
so what do you do with that money

5545.84 --> 5550.08
are you

5546.719 --> 5552.2390000000005
wasting most of it like most people that

5550.08 --> 5556.08
have a lot of money

5552.239 --> 5558.4
that are delusional like yourself

5556.08 --> 5560.239
how how much money are you wasting

5558.4 --> 5562.48
professor phil bell because of your own

5560.239 --> 5565.12
ignorance

5562.48 --> 5566.718999999999
and chasing dreams that are obviously

5565.12 --> 5569.28
not real

5566.719 --> 5571.36
how much of that money of your fantastic

5569.28 --> 5572.5599999999995
little income are you wasting professor

5571.36 --> 5575.28
phil bell

5572.56 --> 5578.719
invested any investments on some stupid

5575.28 --> 5578.719
space launch recently

5601.76 --> 5607.1990000000005
nah i don't think so appreciating that

5605.36 --> 5609.12
i think that he wastes a lot of his

5607.199 --> 5610.799999999999
money

5609.12 --> 5613.36
otherwise he wouldn't be in these

5610.8 --> 5613.360000000001
conditions

5613.52 --> 5618.56
he doesn't look like he's a wealthy man

5616.159 --> 5621.36
probably because he wastes a lot of it

5618.56 --> 5626.280000000001
on complete superfluous [ __ ]

5621.36 --> 5626.28
that doesn't help him or anybody else

5631.52 --> 5635.84
and i agree to that godzilla indeed

5634.32 --> 5640.84
if you're going to be bragging about

5635.84 --> 5640.84
money in my chat you better give me some

5648.96 --> 5651.76
yeah

5649.76 --> 5652.639
otherwise you shouldn't do that

5651.76 --> 5654.56
yeah

5652.639 --> 5656.719
you're looking at a man here who is like

5654.56 --> 5659.280000000001
on the edge of broke constantly yet i

5656.719 --> 5661.199
give my time away

5659.28 --> 5664.239
like to think not for free but

5661.199 --> 5667.759999999999
effectively sometimes it is for free

5664.239 --> 5671.36
and that includes wasting it on somebody

5667.76 --> 5673.12
that literally has a as you say 25 000

5671.36 --> 5675.44
income

5673.12 --> 5675.44
yeah

5675.76 --> 5680.0
so do you do that a lot

5677.92 --> 5682.159
do you go like the

5680.0 --> 5684.719
poor people that are like street

5682.159 --> 5687.839999999999
activists or street performers and then

5684.719 --> 5689.52
do you like demand their time

5687.84 --> 5691.679
for several hours

5689.52 --> 5693.679
and then only give them five cents

5691.679 --> 5695.28
afterward are you one of those people

5693.679 --> 5698.84
professor phil well

5695.28 --> 5698.84
are you like that

5701.66 --> 5704.689
[Music]

5716.82 --> 5720.16
[Music]

5726.32 --> 5729.84
yeah right so

5738.159 --> 5743.92
money hungry space babe okay

5740.88 --> 5746.96
it's a bit over the top but

5743.92 --> 5746.96
yeah i get it

5747.119 --> 5754.44
we support lots of charities oh yes

5751.199 --> 5754.44
of course

5756.239 --> 5759.28
charities for what

5760.719 --> 5764.56
like

5761.84 --> 5766.639
vaccine damage victims let me guess

5764.56 --> 5768.96
child cancer and

5766.639 --> 5770.719
all this [ __ ] that doesn't actually

5768.96 --> 5773.04
prevent

5770.719 --> 5775.36
the thing from reoccurring it actually

5773.04 --> 5777.679
causes more

5775.36 --> 5779.599999999999
of what it claims to help

5777.679 --> 5781.4400000000005
is it are you supporting those types of

5779.6 --> 5785.6
charities professor phil bell because

5781.44 --> 5787.04
there's a lot of them around huh

5785.6 --> 5789.76
like oh

5787.04 --> 5792.48
joe's cancer it's so terrible we're not

5789.76 --> 5794.56
gonna actually stop it from happening

5792.48 --> 5797.28
continually even though a hundred years

5794.56 --> 5799.4400000000005
ago it never happened ever

5797.28 --> 5802.8
no it's just oh it's just it's not

5799.44 --> 5805.28
vaccines or nothing i'll just just give

5802.8 --> 5807.6
charity money and it'll be all right

5805.28 --> 5809.28
because a lot of couple of cancerous

5807.6 --> 5811.1990000000005
kids that are just popping out of

5809.28 --> 5812.88
nowhere we don't know why that's

5811.199 --> 5816.96
happening or they can have a little

5812.88 --> 5819.92
happiness before they die

5816.96 --> 5824.44
is that the type of charity

5819.92 --> 5824.4400000000005
that you help professor phil bill

5827.04 --> 5830.4
or do you actually contribute to

5829.04 --> 5834.08
charities that

5830.4 --> 5836.96
that provably help people

5834.08 --> 5838.84
become better people

5836.96 --> 5841.76
more self-sufficient

5838.84 --> 5843.679
less less of a tool

5841.76 --> 5846.0
to society

5843.679 --> 5848.32
and more self-sufficient

5846.0 --> 5852.52
what type of charities do you give money

5848.32 --> 5852.5199999999995
to professor phil bell

5869.679 --> 5873.1990000000005
super chatter grand

5871.92 --> 5876.08
well

5873.199 --> 5876.08
that would be weird

5876.48 --> 5882.04
i prefer paypal in that fashion but uh

5882.48 --> 5887.759999999999
then at least i'm gonna get that

5885.84 --> 5889.52
i don't know if he would even have that

5887.76 --> 5891.280000000001
look just because he says he has a lot

5889.52 --> 5893.4400000000005
of money doesn't actually mean that he

5891.28 --> 5895.679
actually has it

5893.44 --> 5896.5599999999995
it just means large numbers according to

5895.679 --> 5898.4
him

5896.56 --> 5900.080000000001
past his account

5898.4 --> 5900.879999999999
doesn't mean that he's in control of

5900.08 --> 5903.199
that

5900.88 --> 5905.6
as pro as i said he's probably wasting a

5903.199 --> 5905.599999999999
lot of it

5908.08 --> 5914.719
medical research yes oh

5912.32 --> 5916.88
okay drug rehabilitation that is a good

5914.719 --> 5916.88
thing

5917.119 --> 5921.96
homeless

5918.96 --> 5921.96
sure

5925.199 --> 5930.599999999999
medical research what kind of medical

5927.6 --> 5930.6
research

5939.199 --> 5943.36
that's right sidebar that's exactly my

5941.28 --> 5946.4
sentiment as well that's why i said the

5943.36 --> 5946.4
things that i just said

5951.04 --> 5956.32
yeah so so what kind of medical research

5954.239 --> 5958.879999999999
professor field bill

5956.32 --> 5958.88
would that be

5960.96 --> 5966.92
corona

5963.04 --> 5966.92
virus research

5967.36 --> 5970.719
what type of research

5972.08 --> 5976.08
cancer research i knew it

5975.36 --> 5979.36
so

5976.08 --> 5981.679
you are literally then contributing to

5979.36 --> 5983.92
cancer

5981.679 --> 5983.92
yeah

5984.159 --> 5987.44
you do realize that right

5988.08 --> 5994.0
that cancer research throwing money at

5990.56 --> 5995.52
cancer research literally creates more

5994.0 --> 5997.6
cancer

5995.52 --> 5999.92
do you know that

5997.6 --> 6002.0
do you even know what cancer is

5999.92 --> 6005.36
because those research institutes

6002.0 --> 6005.36
certainly [ __ ] don't

6006.96 --> 6011.199
they don't know [ __ ] about what they're

6009.119 --> 6014.48
actually dealing with they're seeing

6011.199 --> 6016.879999999999
cancer like some kind of invasive thing

6014.48 --> 6018.959999999999
when cancer never just comes out of

6016.88 --> 6022.0
nothing it never

6018.96 --> 6026.8
ever does that ever historically it

6022.0 --> 6031.84
always comes from some kind of poisoning

6026.8 --> 6031.84
toxic overload always yeah

6032.88 --> 6037.36
i mean

6034.159 --> 6038.96
show me a kid a kid

6037.36 --> 6042.32
that isn't just like

6038.96 --> 6045.04
born with like serious issues like

6042.32 --> 6047.759999999999
oh yeah classical issues

6045.04 --> 6049.5199999999995
like what is it again uh

6047.76 --> 6052.2390000000005
like the blood issue that it won't

6049.52 --> 6055.119000000001
coagulate and all that

6052.239 --> 6058.239
those are like typical born issues

6055.119 --> 6062.159
but a lot of like child cancer and [ __ ]

6058.239 --> 6066.4
that is not natural not at all that

6062.159 --> 6066.4
should never happen ever

6066.56 --> 6072.719
right so name one

6069.52 --> 6074.639
one child cancer patient one

6072.719 --> 6077.84
just one

6074.639 --> 6081.92
that as a preteen got cancer

6077.84 --> 6084.159000000001
that did not have a vaccine of any sort

6081.92 --> 6085.1990000000005
name one

6084.159 --> 6089.44
one

6085.199 --> 6090.799999999999
of the hundreds of billions of people

6089.44 --> 6093.119
that have lived

6090.8 --> 6094.56
one name

6093.119 --> 6096.239
one

6094.56 --> 6098.88
one child

6096.239 --> 6102.4
that had cancer before ten

6098.88 --> 6107.119
that did not have a vaccine name one one

6102.4 --> 6111.32
person out of the hundreds of billions

6107.119 --> 6111.32
that have lived one

6121.04 --> 6124.48
yeah it's kind of hard to find those

6122.719 --> 6126.96
nowadays isn't it

6124.48 --> 6129.119
because they just ram that [ __ ] into

6126.96 --> 6131.04
everybody so you're gonna have to go

6129.119 --> 6134.239
back to like

6131.04 --> 6136.56
a hundred years ago or more to even find

6134.239 --> 6138.0
kids that didn't get that [ __ ] and i

6136.56 --> 6140.400000000001
guarantee you

6138.0 --> 6141.44
none of them got cancer

6140.4 --> 6145.32
none

6141.44 --> 6145.32
zero zilch

6158.96 --> 6161.96
uh

6178.639 --> 6181.639
um

6191.36 --> 6195.199
i hope you never need to no you don't

6193.44 --> 6198.0
you don't need to

6195.199 --> 6202.599999999999
you don't need to do that anyway

6198.0 --> 6202.6
people can figure out their own health

6210.08 --> 6215.679
i mean the only thing that i would like

6212.56 --> 6219.679
still go to a doctor for or something is

6215.679 --> 6222.56
i've had a wound and i need it stitched

6219.679 --> 6223.52
now that's a task i would go to a doctor

6222.56 --> 6225.84
for

6223.52 --> 6229.360000000001
that's about it

6225.84 --> 6232.8
or maybe if i like broke a leg and then

6229.36 --> 6236.0
right like serious accidents

6232.8 --> 6238.320000000001
that's the only thing ever

6236.0 --> 6241.04
oh i have an issue i don't feel well i

6238.32 --> 6242.88
don't feel well you have to [ __ ] deal

6241.04 --> 6245.44
with it then

6242.88 --> 6248.32
figure out why you don't feel good

6245.44 --> 6251.199
figure out what you've been doing

6248.32 --> 6253.92
learn about your own health

6251.199 --> 6256.0
and then manage it

6253.92 --> 6259.28
don't just go to the doctor for some

6256.0 --> 6263.6
stupid pill or a fact or something to

6259.28 --> 6265.44
fix something that you don't feel

6263.6 --> 6267.360000000001
no you have to figure out what the hell

6265.44 --> 6270.159
it is you're doing in the first instance

6267.36 --> 6270.159
to cause that

6271.92 --> 6277.119
right like for example ah i feel issues

6274.8 --> 6279.1990000000005
with my with my intestines it's getting

6277.119 --> 6281.44
painful what could be happening yeah

6279.199 --> 6282.719
well to be fair i haven't eaten all the

6281.44 --> 6284.5599999999995
vegetables

6282.719 --> 6287.199
maybe that's the issue maybe i'm missing

6284.56 --> 6289.679
it oh let's test that

6287.199 --> 6291.599999999999
very manipulate the independent variable

6289.679 --> 6292.719
i take some inner food

6291.6 --> 6294.320000000001
i do it

6292.719 --> 6297.04
like every day

6294.32 --> 6297.92
and guess what after two days it's like

6297.04 --> 6300.719
damn

6297.92 --> 6303.04
i have no freaking issue here that was

6300.719 --> 6305.04
the solution did i need to call a doctor

6303.04 --> 6308.08
because my tummy hurts

6305.04 --> 6309.76
no because i'm not a easily panicked

6308.08 --> 6313.44
[ __ ]

6309.76 --> 6316.400000000001
i just figure out what's going on

6313.44 --> 6320.4
and then i take care of it myself

6316.4 --> 6322.799999999999
cheaply without a 200 euro bill for

6320.4 --> 6324.799999999999
being an hour under some doctor that

6322.8 --> 6326.0
isn't even [ __ ] interested in my

6324.8 --> 6328.08
condition

6326.0 --> 6329.36
okay

6328.08 --> 6333.119
thanks

6329.36 --> 6333.119
i'll just take care of it myself

6335.119 --> 6341.36
put yourself from a collapsing one oh

6337.199 --> 6341.36
wow okay that's intense

6342.48 --> 6346.718999999999
i would consider collapsing lung under

6344.8 --> 6348.88
an accident though

6346.719 --> 6351.92
i mean if i had collapsed long i would

6348.88 --> 6354.08
probably go to the doctor with that

6351.92 --> 6356.2390000000005
right because that that does fall under

6354.08 --> 6358.48
like more direct accident type of

6356.239 --> 6361.678999999999
situations

6358.48 --> 6363.839999999999
i think i would die but i did not

6361.679 --> 6366.639
well that's intense man that's

6363.84 --> 6366.639
that's intense

6369.36 --> 6372.88
oh you went to the hospital and it

6370.719 --> 6376.159
wasn't better wow

6372.88 --> 6376.159000000001
well that's just [ __ ]

6378.159 --> 6381.92
okay yeah no wonder then you just didn't

6380.0 --> 6384.92
go after that

6381.92 --> 6384.92
right

6390.96 --> 6395.76
hmm

6392.08 --> 6395.76
now luckily i've never had that

6399.6 --> 6403.85
did search

6400.29 --> 6403.85
[Music]

6405.6 --> 6410.96
oh did not work ouch

6408.639 --> 6410.96
wow

6411.84 --> 6416.32
right but anyway let it be clear if

6414.4 --> 6418.239
something like that happens that does

6416.32 --> 6421.84
kind of fall under the

6418.239 --> 6424.0
calamity or accident category doesn't it

6421.84 --> 6426.0
i mean that's not something that slowly

6424.0 --> 6428.4
starts to grow on you because of

6426.0 --> 6430.4
unhealthy habits i take it

6428.4 --> 6434.0
it's something that just all of a sudden

6430.4 --> 6434.0
happens and you're like ah

6435.04 --> 6437.199
so

6441.04 --> 6444.239
yeah hey

6442.639 --> 6446.56
luna loves ya

6444.239 --> 6448.879999999999
yeah indeed i wasn't sure if you were

6446.56 --> 6451.280000000001
troll or not but i guess not welcome to

6448.88 --> 6451.28
the show

6452.159 --> 6456.4
right but just typical accidents

6454.4 --> 6458.719
calamities that's what i would go to the

6456.4 --> 6461.92
doctor for because it's very acute they

6458.719 --> 6466.0
might have a very quick solution to that

6461.92 --> 6467.6
but if it's like yeah i don't feel good

6466.0 --> 6470.48
i do feel

6467.6 --> 6472.88
bad emotions and i feel bed

6470.48 --> 6475.759999999999
that's not that [ __ ] time to go with

6472.88 --> 6475.76
a doctor okay

6476.0 --> 6480.08
that's more time to go to a therapist

6482.84 --> 6487.76
serious

6484.4 --> 6489.839999999999
besides most people don't even have

6487.76 --> 6492.8
all that much

6489.84 --> 6495.52
[ __ ] on their system most people just

6492.8 --> 6497.360000000001
collapse under their own stress

6495.52 --> 6499.76
because they take too much [ __ ] on their

6497.36 --> 6502.639
shoulders they don't understand

6499.76 --> 6504.08
and then they uh out stress

6502.639 --> 6506.639
by like

6504.08 --> 6509.679
outdated modes of thinking and they over

6506.639 --> 6511.36
stress about everything and then just

6509.679 --> 6512.88
they just collapse under that [ __ ]

6511.36 --> 6516.639
there's pure stress

6512.88 --> 6518.88
right how's the doctor gonna help

6516.639 --> 6521.119
except by recommending like hey maybe

6518.88 --> 6522.2390000000005
you should take a goddamn vacation you

6521.119 --> 6523.44
freak

6522.239 --> 6525.839999999999
this

6523.44 --> 6528.239
well that's you know do you really go to

6525.84 --> 6529.4400000000005
a doctor to get an advice like that

6528.239 --> 6533.159
you know

6529.44 --> 6533.159
is that worth it

6541.36 --> 6545.839999999999
sucks being an empath yeah it can sucks

6543.76 --> 6549.4400000000005
it can suck definitely especially when

6545.84 --> 6551.4400000000005
something somebody's in real anguish

6549.44 --> 6554.08
because you feel that

6551.44 --> 6556.5599999999995
or when somebody's like very out loud

6554.08 --> 6558.639
being extremely whiny

6556.56 --> 6561.1990000000005
like some little kids here in this

6558.639 --> 6563.36
neighborhood something yeah

6561.199 --> 6565.199
i'm just like

6563.36 --> 6569.48
because it just

6565.199 --> 6569.48
it gets straight to me

6573.76 --> 6579.04
because i can hear when they're actually

6576.159 --> 6581.199
whining if they're just like ow

6579.04 --> 6583.28
or something then i'm like oh [ __ ] maybe

6581.199 --> 6584.638999999999
they need help but sometimes kids just

6583.28 --> 6587.759999999999
yell

6584.639 --> 6590.56
just to whine and i can hear it when

6587.76 --> 6590.56
they do that

6592.4 --> 6598.4
i can hear when they intend to be whiny

6595.76 --> 6599.84
and i [ __ ] hate that

6598.4 --> 6602.4
because they don't have authority over

6599.84 --> 6604.159000000001
those children

6602.4 --> 6607.28
to make it stop

6604.159 --> 6610.4
because you should stop if your kid is

6607.28 --> 6612.719
just whining out loud you should stop

6610.4 --> 6612.719
them

6613.119 --> 6617.119
it's indecent not to

6617.52 --> 6622.1990000000005
okay what the hell are you talking about

6619.199 --> 6622.199
fibros

6627.52 --> 6634.2390000000005
empath no there's no such thing

6630.88 --> 6636.4800000000005
either you're open up or you're not

6634.239 --> 6638.799999999999
if you close down

6636.48 --> 6640.879999999999
you go in a direction of closing down if

6638.8 --> 6643.92
you open up you go in the direction of

6640.88 --> 6644.96
opening up you can't

6643.92 --> 6647.92
do that

6644.96 --> 6650.08
as an amp i can

6647.92 --> 6653.84
either it's open or it's not

6650.08 --> 6653.84
you can't like put it in between

6654.719 --> 6659.76
like i can be lucky to

6657.679 --> 6661.84
because of the motion because there's

6659.76 --> 6663.52
always a motion there

6661.84 --> 6665.84
to be in a very

6663.52 --> 6668.719
unique equilibrium position in that

6665.84 --> 6672.159000000001
moment where i have a great balance

6668.719 --> 6672.159
but it never stays

6672.88 --> 6677.599
because naturally as an empath i have a

6675.76 --> 6679.52
tendency to become

6677.599 --> 6682.96
completely open

6679.52 --> 6685.360000000001
which is intangible by the way

6682.96 --> 6687.92
it is not a tenable state of being to

6685.36 --> 6687.92
have that

6689.37 --> 6695.5199999999995
[Music]

6693.36 --> 6698.96
can you waste time wishing for sure you

6695.52 --> 6701.040000000001
can wish for whatever you want

6698.96 --> 6702.4
hey and if like the

6701.04 --> 6705.28
virtual

6702.4 --> 6708.159
imprinting by of by yourself to yourself

6705.28 --> 6710.0
of a shield around you helps you to

6708.159 --> 6712.638999999999
distract you

6710.0 --> 6714.48
from the empathic connection

6712.639 --> 6716.96
then that works too doesn't matter what

6714.48 --> 6719.36
you think of it whether you feel shields

6716.96 --> 6721.679
it's about not connecting because of

6719.36 --> 6724.88
something you're doing

6721.679 --> 6726.719
internal chanting to distract you

6724.88 --> 6729.84
you can do that to

6726.719 --> 6732.639
to prevent empathy from

6729.84 --> 6736.28
yeah throwing [ __ ] at you that you

6732.639 --> 6736.28
really can't use

6741.92 --> 6745.76
be alone to recharge that's right

6744.0 --> 6747.52
i can't block it

6745.76 --> 6750.56
that's why when i'm in the company of

6747.52 --> 6752.88
people i always become exhausted after a

6750.56 --> 6752.88
while

6761.599 --> 6766.88
and then i just have to retreat exactly

6763.599 --> 6766.88
like you said balloon as loves

6778.48 --> 6783.119
you're gonna try okay cool glad i was

6781.04 --> 6784.96
able to give you a good suggestion on

6783.119 --> 6788.44
that

6784.96 --> 6788.44
where's the dog

6793.28 --> 6796.8
an interesting show today

6796.88 --> 6802.159000000001
oh and for those who hadn't or forgot

6799.84 --> 6803.84
about it the title

6802.159 --> 6807.28
can any of you guess what the title is

6803.84 --> 6810.63
referring to

6807.28 --> 6817.389999999999
not expecting you to guess it right but

6810.63 --> 6817.39
[Music]

6820.96 --> 6832.88
can anybody guess

6823.47 --> 6835.84
[Music]

6832.88 --> 6835.84
this says no

6836.48 --> 6841.919999999999
the title of my show

6839.52 --> 6845.8
i mean it's been there from the start

6841.92 --> 6845.8
nobody addressed it

6853.92 --> 6856.56
you're stumped

6856.639 --> 6860.32
what

6858.159 --> 6860.32
no

6860.56 --> 6866.719
the title of my show what is that do any

6863.599 --> 6866.719
of you know what that is

6867.36 --> 6871.48
what are you talking about stumped

6884.239 --> 6887.239
wow

6890.239 --> 6895.919999999999
is nobody seeing the title of my show

6893.119 --> 6898.799999999999
it's called the shamanic little fountain

6895.92 --> 6898.8
of the gods

6898.96 --> 6902.639
yes so i'm asking you

6901.199 --> 6905.119
what do you think

6902.639 --> 6908.56
that is

6905.119 --> 6908.5599999999995
why did i give it that title

6913.44 --> 6916.799999999999
it's my full name

6917.04 --> 6920.0
it's the assembly

6919.28 --> 6923.199
of

6920.0 --> 6925.92
the meanings of my full names

6923.199 --> 6927.44
all of it all three names this is what

6925.92 --> 6930.159
it actually means

6927.44 --> 6930.159
this is me

6930.88 --> 6934.56
this is the full meaning of my name

6936.639 --> 6939.1990000000005
literally

6944.4 --> 6947.839999999999
isn't that interesting

6951.679 --> 6953.92
right

6952.48 --> 6956.239
so

6953.92 --> 6961.119
you already might guess that fountain of

6956.239 --> 6962.799999999999
the gods is actually our win

6961.119 --> 6964.719
yes

6962.8 --> 6967.119000000001
little

6964.719 --> 6970.4800000000005
well my front name is paul

6967.119 --> 6972.96
paul means little one

6970.48 --> 6975.839999999999
and the shamanic part

6972.96 --> 6977.84
is a little cheating but it was very

6975.84 --> 6979.84
appropriate it's my last name which is

6977.84 --> 6982.639
actually a shortened version of an

6979.84 --> 6984.0
original name that i don't even know

6982.639 --> 6986.08
anymore

6984.0 --> 6986.88
was originally indonesian

6986.08 --> 6988.96
but

6986.88 --> 6990.96
the funny thing is that my last name

6988.96 --> 6992.719
come

6990.96 --> 6996.159
in turkish

6992.719 --> 6996.159
means shaman

6999.04 --> 7005.44
so yeah i did mix it up this is not a

7001.199 --> 7005.44
uniform language it's basically

7005.679 --> 7007.92
uh

7009.119 --> 7014.32
what do you call that

7010.96 --> 7017.199
greco romano which is paul

7014.32 --> 7018.799999999999
arwyn which is actually alvin

7017.199 --> 7020.879999999999
which yeah

7018.8 --> 7023.76
go all over the place where alvin was

7020.88 --> 7025.4400000000005
derived from by tolkien right

7023.76 --> 7027.76
and come

7025.44 --> 7031.839999999999
which is originally indonesian name but

7027.76 --> 7031.84
in turkish happens to mean shaman

7032.4 --> 7034.638999999999
or

7035.84 --> 7038.56
way what

7038.8 --> 7043.1990000000005
okay i guess they could also be

7041.44 --> 7046.5599999999995
the way of the little fountain of the

7043.199 --> 7049.678999999999
gods then road of the interesting

7046.56 --> 7053.1990000000005
i'm indonesian no i'm not indonesian i

7049.679 --> 7055.84
have i'm like one sixteenth indonesian

7053.199 --> 7058.239
or something very little but it is

7055.84 --> 7060.56
a very influential set of genes i

7058.239 --> 7060.5599999999995
believe

7062.4 --> 7067.119
and i've always like

7064.32 --> 7069.5199999999995
been drawn to indonesian things it's

7067.119 --> 7071.92
really unique to me there's like this

7069.52 --> 7073.280000000001
calling thing or something that happens

7071.92 --> 7075.92
spiritually

7073.28 --> 7077.5199999999995
right but i'm very little of it

7075.92 --> 7080.32
but still

7077.52 --> 7080.320000000001
it is in there

7081.199 --> 7089.119
i'm also chinese a little

7084.4 --> 7089.119
and german and belgium but mostly dutch

7096.159 --> 7101.679
right but the name from my dad was

7099.52 --> 7103.040000000001
originally from my granddad

7101.679 --> 7105.1990000000005
who was

7103.04 --> 7107.199
half indonesia or like yeah half

7105.199 --> 7110.638999999999
indonesian

7107.199 --> 7110.638999999999
half indonesian half german

7112.4 --> 7119.679
so yeah my family generations have been

7115.599 --> 7119.679
mixing in for quite a while

7120.719 --> 7124.92
like

7121.52 --> 7124.92
over a century

7130.48 --> 7136.48
no that's just called drugs

7133.84 --> 7138.88
and i recommend against it fiber oats

7136.48 --> 7140.718999999999
and even if you do want to talk about

7138.88 --> 7142.8
that i don't want you to talk about that

7140.719 --> 7146.2390000000005
in my chat because it's not a common

7142.8 --> 7148.56
subject to talk about in a 12 plus chat

7146.239 --> 7150.5599999999995
just like sexual subjects

7148.56 --> 7151.360000000001
i don't want to talk about that and

7150.56 --> 7153.119000000001
there

7151.36 --> 7157.36
but the thing i will say is i recommend

7153.119 --> 7159.44
against it you want to try it yes

7157.36 --> 7162.719
well get ready some for some freaking

7159.44 --> 7164.638999999999
nightmares yeah nightmares

7162.719 --> 7167.119
guaranteed one way or the other you're

7164.639 --> 7169.4400000000005
gonna get nightmares it's always it

7167.119 --> 7170.799999999999
always happens

7169.44 --> 7172.0
especially if you haven't tried it

7170.8 --> 7175.119000000001
before

7172.0 --> 7177.76
yeah because you are will you will be

7175.119 --> 7183.159
exposed to your demons

7177.76 --> 7183.159000000001
and you think you know them guess again

7186.159 --> 7193.119
yeah it doesn't sound good it's a very

7188.88 --> 7197.36
very serious trial yeah

7193.119 --> 7199.759999999999
i mean ayahuasca dmt it's not a freaking

7197.36 --> 7203.44
party drug and people that say that are

7199.76 --> 7203.4400000000005
satanic criminals

7204.159 --> 7208.96
evil really really evil

7211.199 --> 7218.48
it's a very dangerous substance it can

7213.76 --> 7218.4800000000005
drive people insane and to suicide

7218.56 --> 7226.639
because it is a trial a really serious

7222.88 --> 7231.119
trial a spiritual internal trial and you

7226.639 --> 7231.119
need to be ready or you can die

7232.0 --> 7238.08
and it's not a threat that's established

7234.8 --> 7238.08
reality about it

7238.239 --> 7242.879999999999
take it very very serious

7242.0 --> 7244.639
right

7242.88 --> 7247.599
i mean if you're gonna be like i am

7244.639 --> 7250.639
gonna be like a healer and a shaman and

7247.599 --> 7252.56
like i'm giving it my life right

7250.639 --> 7255.4400000000005
like there's nothing else out there for

7252.56 --> 7256.4800000000005
me this is what i'm gonna do forever

7255.44 --> 7258.719
then

7256.48 --> 7260.959999999999
then you might be like okay well in

7258.719 --> 7265.599
order to actually establish that i need

7260.96 --> 7269.599
to do this as a trial as a test

7265.599 --> 7271.599
test of spiritual survival and dynamic

7269.599 --> 7274.56
let's test the stamina because it's

7271.599 --> 7274.56
[ __ ] dangerous

7277.44 --> 7281.4
so enough about that

7286.239 --> 7291.36
i mean if you enter the dark world which

7288.96 --> 7294.719
is what it does

7291.36 --> 7297.44
not being prepared not knowing what real

7294.719 --> 7300.4800000000005
sins are you know what's gonna happen

7297.44 --> 7304.96
the demons are gonna rub that [ __ ] in

7300.48 --> 7308.239
your face over and over and over again

7304.96 --> 7311.119
until you literally become haunted by it

7308.239 --> 7313.678999999999
yeah that's what happens

7311.119 --> 7314.88
if you don't recognize a sin in your

7313.679 --> 7316.639
life

7314.88 --> 7320.639
within your spirit

7316.639 --> 7323.4400000000005
you're going to be tortured with it

7320.639 --> 7327.84
and that can virtually last as seeming

7323.44 --> 7327.839999999999
eternity to you in that experience

7332.8 --> 7337.52
i don't know and i don't care

7335.119 --> 7341.598999999999
nobody should enter the dark world

7337.52 --> 7341.599
it is born from terror

7342.96 --> 7348.56
it's an emergency system

7345.84 --> 7350.8
a parallel dimension emergency system

7348.56 --> 7354.88
you only go there

7350.8 --> 7354.88
when you are in terror

7365.44 --> 7369.598999999999
yeah if if you want if you're really

7367.76 --> 7371.119000000001
interested and you want to know a little

7369.599 --> 7374.0
more

7371.119 --> 7376.08
go and watch blueberry

7374.0 --> 7377.44
i had a whole week i was harping about

7376.08 --> 7378.5599999999995
that

7377.44 --> 7381.04
because it's

7378.56 --> 7382.320000000001
the best

7381.04 --> 7386.0
reference

7382.32 --> 7389.36
i know to that substance even existing

7386.0 --> 7391.92
without corrupting it immediately within

7389.36 --> 7391.92
the movie

7392.84 --> 7396.400000000001
blueberry

7394.719 --> 7399.119
if you want to know about that sort of

7396.4 --> 7403.719
stuff watch blueberry

7399.119 --> 7403.719
yeah blueberry or the renegade

7409.199 --> 7412.719
and yeah if you want to find an episode

7411.36 --> 7414.719
about that

7412.719 --> 7417.44
on my show i talked about it very

7414.719 --> 7418.96
elaborately it's some months ago just

7417.44 --> 7420.32
look at

7418.96 --> 7423.199

7438.48 --> 7443.598999999999
yes but it doesn't have subtitles there

7441.36 --> 7448.839999999999
and you really need it because it's not

7443.599 --> 7448.84
a singular language movie

7454.32 --> 7457.32
so

7461.46 --> 7464.56
[Music]

7470.78 --> 7473.87

7559.76 --> 7564.56
the song from the menu

7565.44 --> 7571.199
give you a hint as to the music

7568.48 --> 7571.199
keen to watch

7572.079 --> 7577.04
i hope i'm not gonna get

7573.679 --> 7580.0
it might give me like a music

7577.04 --> 7581.5199999999995
demonetized thingy i don't know i'm

7580.0 --> 7583.76
gonna try it anyway because i want you

7581.52 --> 7585.280000000001

7583.76 --> 7588.0
that

7585.28 --> 7591.36
little intro song even sounds oh yeah by

7588.0 --> 7593.679
the way donate to my paypal please

7591.36 --> 7593.679

7594.48 --> 7598.159
i would really appreciate that uh here

7596.4 --> 7600.638999999999
you go

7598.159 --> 7604.36
oh might get some

7600.639 --> 7604.36
all right there it is

7609.679 --> 7612.679
so

7620.62 --> 7682.129
[Music]

7684.75 --> 7695.609
[Music]

7697.44 --> 7706.96
oh that's actually a mayan calendar

7700.9 --> 7709.96
[Music]

7706.96 --> 7709.96
so

7711.26 --> 7736.25
[Music]

7745.44 --> 7751.839999999999
it's pretty badass intro right

7749.04 --> 7754.88
and it's literally from this from the

7751.84 --> 7759.84
movie so the entire movie is like that

7754.88 --> 7759.84
quality music it's freaking awesome

7770.84 --> 7777.679
right we'll see what happens

7774.48 --> 7779.759999999999
it's like a loop of like what is it

7777.679 --> 7783.119
30 seconds or something

7779.76 --> 7785.599
i hope it won't get a strike for that

7783.119 --> 7787.598999999999
or whatever

7785.599 --> 7790.079
a demonetization of this singular

7787.599 --> 7790.079
episode

7794.079 --> 7799.679
anyways yeah susie yes you'd probably

7796.639 --> 7802.88
love it but i do recommend do not just

7799.679 --> 7805.84
find some standard youtube version

7802.88 --> 7807.92
because it will not have the subtitles i

7805.84 --> 7809.52
tried to warn this like the entire week

7807.92 --> 7812.0
when i was first bringing this on the

7809.52 --> 7815.599
stage here

7812.0 --> 7819.04
all the online [ __ ] and they don't have

7815.599 --> 7821.84
subtitles you need

7819.04 --> 7823.44
subtitles you need it

7821.84 --> 7824.96
if your version doesn't have it you

7823.44 --> 7828.0
notice like hey they're talking i'm not

7824.96 --> 7830.0
seeing subtitles don't watch it because

7828.0 --> 7831.52
you'll miss out

7830.0 --> 7834.0
you need

7831.52 --> 7836.2390000000005
subtitles but they might be very hard to

7834.0 --> 7836.239
find

7838.719 --> 7842.56
right they speak

7840.159 --> 7843.839999999999
what is it a native american language in

7842.56 --> 7846.2390000000005
this

7843.84 --> 7850.719
and there's no subtitles within the

7846.239 --> 7854.28
movie you have to have subtitles

7850.719 --> 7854.28
just so you know

7857.28 --> 7861.36
so make sure of that before you give in

7859.28 --> 7863.44
to your enthusiasm

7861.36 --> 7865.28
i mean it you're going to be sorry

7863.44 --> 7868.239
because you're going to miss out on just

7865.28 --> 7872.239
very esoteric details because like the

7868.239 --> 7874.079
words they speak in this thing matter

7872.239 --> 7876.638999999999
especially what the native americans

7874.079 --> 7876.639
have to say

7876.96 --> 7882.56
very easy to find on bit you

7879.52 --> 7882.56
with the subtitles

7882.96 --> 7887.679
george sanford

7885.199 --> 7889.28
are you sure

7887.679 --> 7891.76
that's interesting i've never even

7889.28 --> 7891.759999999999
checked that

7891.92 --> 7895.4800000000005
let me check that

7898.159 --> 7902.5599999999995
oh maybe

7900.079 --> 7905.799999999999
somebody did actually chat that

7902.56 --> 7905.8
check that

7937.28 --> 7943.04
very easy to find oh yes yes

7940.48 --> 7947.28
so easy i'm literally searching right

7943.04 --> 7947.28
now i'm not finding it yes so easy

7950.079 --> 7953.639
that's from 2004

7957.76 --> 7962.639
nothing nothing nothing yeah

7960.639 --> 7964.2390000000005
great

7962.639 --> 7965.679
you told me that months ago yeah where's

7964.239 --> 7966.638999999999
the link

7965.679 --> 7968.88
where is it

7966.639 --> 7972.679
because i can't find it

7968.88 --> 7972.679
searching right now

7995.52 --> 7998.639
okay

7996.56 --> 8001.76
very ready oh yeah that works okay let's

7998.639 --> 8001.76
see subtitles

8006.639 --> 8012.719
god damn it

8008.96 --> 8012.719
well this thing takes forever to load

8014.719 --> 8019.639
september 2019 uploaded

8024.719 --> 8027.52
video what

8027.76 --> 8031.76
okay there's an original video on

8029.92 --> 8036.36
youtube apparently

8031.76 --> 8036.360000000001
video isn't available anywhere oh goody

8045.84 --> 8050.56
okay well that link is nice

8048.639 --> 8052.32
oh wow they put ayahuasca in the

8050.56 --> 8054.88
freaking title like that's the only

8052.32 --> 8057.36
[ __ ] thing about it

8054.88 --> 8058.719
yeah it's not loading though it's just

8057.36 --> 8060.4
sitting there

8058.719 --> 8063.4
so the stream quality on this one is

8060.4 --> 8063.4
terrible

8071.44 --> 8075.04
you thought i was native american when

8073.119 --> 8078.719
you first saw me

8075.04 --> 8078.719
well i'm a little too white for that

8079.679 --> 8084.0
but yeah

8081.119 --> 8087.759999999999
i mean i have this awesome photo that my

8084.0 --> 8089.76
parents made when i was a baby

8087.76 --> 8093.719
i guess i'll show that off again just

8089.76 --> 8093.719
like i did last time

8096.4 --> 8098.96
where is it

8101.679 --> 8108.119
i got so many photos it's really hard to

8104.079 --> 8108.119
find anything in there

8111.28 --> 8114.159
come on man

8116.56 --> 8122.56
a really cute one too when i was five

8119.28 --> 8122.5599999999995
my first girlfriend

8123.599 --> 8128.4800000000005
it was completely oblivious to what was

8126.0 --> 8128.48
going on

8133.119 --> 8136.679
where is it

8154.239 --> 8157.119
god damn it

8158.88 --> 8163.599
must be here somewhere it's just

8161.84 --> 8166.32
yeah

8163.599 --> 8168.4800000000005
i'm not a very efficient person for

8166.32 --> 8170.239
picking out the right photo in like a

8168.48 --> 8173.759999999999
giant lineup

8170.239 --> 8173.759999999999
because it just makes me dizzy

8177.04 --> 8180.4
it has to be somewhere

8185.28 --> 8189.759999999999
because i'll literally overlook it i'll

8187.36 --> 8193.84
just look at it like five times before i

8189.76 --> 8193.84
first ah there it is damn it

8202.639 --> 8207.16
yeah it's a photo of a photo so

8215.359 --> 8219.599
right

8216.559 --> 8219.599
so that's me

8219.679 --> 8227.24
in america when i was a baby because my

8222.639 --> 8227.24
parents went there when i was a baby

8240.08 --> 8245.24
it's pretty good photo qualities for

8241.92 --> 8245.24
like 1980.

8255.28 --> 8258.28
hmm

8262.319 --> 8266.88
link was posted yeah but even pga cnet

8264.559 --> 8269.518999999998
even back then we didn't actually manage

8266.88 --> 8269.518999999998
to find it

8272.08 --> 8276.479
right but that was an actual native

8273.92 --> 8280.519
american baby right there

8276.479 --> 8280.519
was a lot browner than me

8290.479 --> 8295.84
i mean i'm very pale for like a hybrid

8293.599 --> 8298.0
person

8295.84 --> 8301.12
then again i am technically like three

8298.0 --> 8301.12
quarters just dutch

8302.319 --> 8307.039999999999
and a little bit of many different other

8304.719 --> 8307.039999999999
things

8308.399 --> 8313.84
what a part of the us did i visit uh i

8311.04 --> 8313.84
think that was like

8315.12 --> 8318.559000000001
i don't know

8317.359 --> 8321.439
the

8318.559 --> 8323.438999999998
natural parks and

8321.439 --> 8325.519
it just went through a tour of nature

8323.439 --> 8328.960000000001
really

8325.519 --> 8328.960000000001
i don't even know where that was

8331.04 --> 8337.399000000001
i might like ask my dad maybe he

8333.12 --> 8337.399000000001
remembers the rock that they took

8350.16 --> 8354.0
look like a little michelin man with

8351.76 --> 8358.24
those rules yeah that's because i was

8354.0 --> 8358.24
like really engorging on milk

8358.399 --> 8361.92
my mother used to keep telling me like

8360.479 --> 8364.319
you were like

8361.92 --> 8366.8
a serious boob hog

8364.319 --> 8369.599
because it just

8366.8 --> 8369.599
i want it all

8370.399 --> 8374.719
i yeah i was extremely enthusiastic so

8372.88 --> 8377.039999999999
no wonder i look like a little michelin

8374.719 --> 8377.039999999999
man

8378.0 --> 8381.519
i had plenty of baby fat

8385.84 --> 8390.319
although i never actually did like get

8388.08 --> 8392.0
have a chubby face i was never chubby in

8390.319 --> 8393.92
my life

8392.0 --> 8396.319
except maybe no no that's not really

8393.92 --> 8396.319
chubby

8398.479 --> 8402.438999999998
it's just baby fat

8423.2 --> 8426.2
hmm

8432.8 --> 8436.0
i love being a parent

8436.56 --> 8439.84
i'd like to be one

8441.52 --> 8447.359
i mean if my kid would be like half as

8443.84 --> 8449.68
amazing as i was as a kid to my parents

8447.359 --> 8453.880000000001
i mean it would be such a waste not to

8449.68 --> 8453.880000000001
have that experience in my life

8462.479 --> 8467.679999999998
but yeah you can't really do it alone

8465.68 --> 8470.68
i don't want to be a single dad or

8467.68 --> 8470.68
something

8485.84 --> 8487.92
you

8502.56 --> 8505.6
anyway

8503.76 --> 8507.359
i think i'm gonna round out the show wow

8505.6 --> 8510.16
i've been gone for two hours and 20

8507.359 --> 8512.16
minutes right so again i am going to

8629.84 --> 8635.439
i'm glad i was able to inspire you

8633.359 --> 8638.0
with that it's a movie i'm gonna keep

8635.439 --> 8640.319
bringing back up every now and then

8638.0 --> 8641.6
probably every spin every spring and

8640.319 --> 8642.96
every

8641.6 --> 8646.16
and the summer

8642.96 --> 8648.8
because it's just a movie that's amazing

8646.16 --> 8649.6
and i want people to see it because it

8648.8 --> 8650.96
is

8649.6 --> 8653.359
something else

8650.96 --> 8655.358999999999
it's like one of the most uncorrupted

8653.359 --> 8656.319
movies i've ever seen

8655.359 --> 8659.359
as in

8656.319 --> 8660.479
not hollywood corruption it is really a

8659.359 --> 8664.08
pure

8660.479 --> 8666.319
as they come movie it's kind of unique

8664.08 --> 8667.68
and it was highly

8666.319 --> 8669.6
shedded on like

8667.68 --> 8671.28
everybody's like oh i'm so stupid and

8669.6 --> 8672.24
it's like oh it's beautiful but i don't

8671.28 --> 8674.319000000001
like it

8672.24 --> 8676.8
it was it didn't get the attention it

8674.319 --> 8678.24
deserved

8676.8 --> 8681.519999999999
it didn't

8678.24 --> 8683.68
it's one of the most beautiful movies in

8681.52 --> 8686.319000000001
that sort of genre that i've ever seen

8683.68 --> 8688.960000000001
but it's very different

8686.319 --> 8690.96
from everything else you've seen

8688.96 --> 8692.96
there is no movie like this

8690.96 --> 8696.56
because this is a movie that is very

8692.96 --> 8698.64
much about feelings and the experience

8696.56 --> 8701.6
it's about the spirit this movie is

8698.64 --> 8704.0
about the spirit

8701.6 --> 8706.319
yeah and if you're a scored boy piece of

8704.0 --> 8708.0
[ __ ] atheist materialist that just poo

8706.319 --> 8710.24
poos on everything just because they

8708.0 --> 8712.56
don't get it in that singular moment

8710.24 --> 8715.199999999999
you're not gonna like this movie you're

8712.56 --> 8718.08
gonna think it's kind of underwhelming

8715.2 --> 8722.319000000001
yeah because you're numbed you're numbed

8718.08 --> 8727.479
down by all the violent demonic [ __ ]

8722.319 --> 8727.479
that you've been subjected to that's why

8742.319 --> 8746.199999999999

8753.92 --> 8761.8

8771.68 --> 8775.82
change the energy for the better
