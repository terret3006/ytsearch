7.74 --> 42.679
[Music]

38.17 --> 47.719
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.679 --> 52.549
early-bird episode 101 I'm your host

47.719 --> 58.43
Arwen and today is quite a different day

52.549 --> 60.859
from yesterday can't spot any chemtrails

58.43 --> 64.339
today but there's plenty of clouds it's

60.859 --> 68.2
not as warm as it was yesterday but at

64.339 --> 71.869
least there's no chemtrails feels better

68.2 --> 73.459
so oh yeah by the way thanks for the

71.869 --> 77.09
super chat donation then you'll feel

73.459 --> 82.009
much appreciate it yeah got a super chat

77.09 --> 85.31
even before the show that's nice so yeah

82.009 --> 89.99
how are you guys all doing and gals I am

85.31 --> 96.86
Steve Shan Walter Constance Bruns to see

89.99 --> 100.19
you Ragnar Stefan Alderson mr. sir over

96.86 --> 104.84
Mukul good to see you

100.19 --> 110.769
yeah Yeah right before the show I was on

104.84 --> 114.229
re sheets show twice flat smacking and

110.769 --> 116.119
yeah we had a - interesting

114.229 --> 119.209
conversations right before this it's

116.119 --> 121.849
almost like I wish I had him on my show

119.209 --> 124.72
for long because yeah he was asking

121.849 --> 127.12
pretty good questions and loved that

124.72 --> 131.32
that's about tart area oh yeah and we

127.12 --> 134.53
talked about what is up there the

131.32 --> 136.84
Wealth's presupposed dome what that

134.53 --> 140.35
really is referring also to blow

136.84 --> 145.06
Buster's last Sunday and what is down

140.35 --> 148.09
there the suppose it's super saline

145.06 --> 153.1
water barrier at the bottom of the ocean

148.09 --> 156.16
yeah it was a good conversation but yeah

153.1 --> 161.14
this is my show now so now I have to

156.16 --> 165.22
talk about what I talked about here see

161.14 --> 170.52999999999997
low flatten earth got a Meakin chin

165.22 --> 178.89
Bubba yeah good to see you all so what

170.53 --> 185.49
shall I talk about yesterday I was asked

178.89 --> 191.89
about a couple of things the documentary

185.49 --> 193.81
the documentary behind the curve I've

191.89 --> 196.26999999999998
never actually seen it heard a lot about

193.81 --> 199.989
it and I watched it I watched it

196.27 --> 204.27
completely yesterday and that was tough

199.989 --> 204.27
that was tough to sit through

204.67 --> 217.849
it is quite a devious movie in my

209.69 --> 219.53
opinion it's some very mixed I've had

217.849 --> 222.47
some very mixed feelings about it

219.53 --> 228.68
because yeah there were these two sides

222.47 --> 231.2
one hand there was just de the flat

228.68 --> 236.09
earthers mark Sargent mostly Patricia

231.2 --> 238.60999999999999
steer Jaron Bob other guys the typical

236.09 --> 241.06900000000002
the the first way flat earth if you'd

238.61 --> 244.31
call it and what they do how it is to be

241.069 --> 248.03
Flat Earth there and yeah also the

244.31 --> 250.37
typical problems that come tend to come

248.03 --> 254.56
with being a flat earther and that was

250.37 --> 260.169
kind of nice but then yeah the crew of

254.56 --> 260.169
behind the curve they were

260.299 --> 268.63899999999995
yeah pretty much nasty ballers in their

264.199 --> 272.77000000000004
own way and they emphasized every little

268.639 --> 275.03000000000003
problem that the flat earthers may have

272.77 --> 278.389
psychologically you know my god and

275.03 --> 281.86999999999995
everybody who they really tried to put a

278.389 --> 285.05
baller picture over it like why would

281.87 --> 287.12
flood earthers do that and oh when they

285.05 --> 290.56
turn out to be wrong are they still

287.12 --> 294.889
going to stick to being a Flat Earth in

290.56 --> 299.47
the bias and all that he was quite

294.889 --> 299.47
aggravating quite quite so

300.72 --> 308.82000000000005
also because yeah how they designed that

304.66 --> 316.53000000000003
movie that worked that worked against us

308.82 --> 319.71999999999997
because I'd imagine that if I what

316.53 --> 322.21
basically confront somebody that doesn't

319.72 --> 325.06
know anything about Flat Earth and that

322.21 --> 328.41999999999996
may have the typical skeptical first

325.06 --> 332.02
response and you tell them yeah go watch

328.42 --> 335.59000000000003
this movie it's really out there that's

332.02 --> 338.88
actually gonna work to reinforce the

335.59 --> 342.90999999999997
bias against Flat Earth pretty badly

338.88 --> 347.59
because yeah they made us look like a

342.91 --> 350.5
bunch of reject a reject culture that's

347.59 --> 353.38
just struggling trying to stick together

350.5 --> 355.48
because everybody rejects them because

353.38 --> 359.68
yeah of course Flat Earth is you're

355.48 --> 361.48
wrong man but why is like why are the

359.68 --> 364.03000000000003
Flat Earth they're so enthusiastic and

361.48 --> 369.84000000000003
look they're so creative they're so

364.03 --> 373.45
enthusiastic without without really

369.84 --> 375.31
sharing why well on the other hand the

373.45 --> 379.39
other of course I'm starting to Trisha

375.31 --> 381.25
they did give an explanation like it

379.39 --> 384.66999999999996
really is a sense of community and

381.25 --> 387.31
rejecting the lies outside but the

384.67 --> 392.77000000000004
baller group the bother

387.31 --> 396.31
documentary crew didn't didn't give any

392.77 --> 398.2
hear to that at all they just and with

396.31 --> 403.62
this misted overlook they didn't talk

398.2 --> 406.12
about it and just try to emphasize the

403.62 --> 408.72
psychological isolation and all the

406.12 --> 412.41
effects that come with it it was

408.72 --> 421.08000000000004
extremely repulsive extremely so and

412.41 --> 428.13000000000005
they did in a very manipulative way just

421.08 --> 430.41999999999996
they showed Bob and Jared did 2x

428.13 --> 432.43
experiments not even really scientific

430.42 --> 437.02000000000004
method basic spirits that didn't even go

432.43 --> 440.35
into that and they emphasized how we

437.02 --> 442.39
didn't work out and oh my god it's so

440.35 --> 445.09000000000003
embarrassing it's like all these flat

442.39 --> 447.19
earthers they look they really try they

445.09 --> 449.79999999999995
really try but doesn't work out and

447.19 --> 452.17
they'll keep on going because they're so

449.8 --> 454.63
brave and their endeavour of trying to

452.17 --> 456.28000000000003
prove it's flat well of course it's a

454.63 --> 459.96
ball so the experiments are never going

456.28 --> 465.05999999999995
to work out so dramatic so sad for them

459.96 --> 469.85999999999996
it's evil but they did is evil like

465.06 --> 474.51
really really deep deception evil

469.86 --> 474.51
manipulation evil it's disgusting

476.95 --> 483.07
what we need to do and I think we can we

480.31 --> 485.41
as in the the wider community the people

483.07 --> 488.34999999999997
that have already made much progress

485.41 --> 493.23
made much connections got resources

488.35 --> 497.32000000000005
together what we need to do is make a

493.23 --> 498.91
behind the obstruction movie that's how

497.32 --> 503.08
I think we should call it behind the

498.91 --> 503.44
obstruction yeah it's you know what I

503.08 --> 508.56
mean

503.44 --> 512.5
and actually follow-up of these

508.56 --> 516.94
experiments and see what the actual

512.5 --> 520.479
after result of that was how we figured

516.94 --> 522.19
out optics and explained what is

520.479 --> 529.5600000000001
actually happening there with real

522.19 --> 532.96
optics research references and show that

529.56 --> 536.26
that was just one step on the way it

532.96 --> 539.47
doesn't end there like to be on behind

536.26 --> 542.74
the curve documentary so heavily suggest

539.47 --> 548.14
and literally end on that note oh it

542.74 --> 551.08
didn't work out yeah because it didn't

548.14 --> 553.71
work out I know it did so much more we

551.08 --> 553.71
discovered

557.56 --> 563.53
and also been thinking about just the

559.42 --> 566.02
entire angle how I heard mark and

563.53 --> 569.26
Patricia talk about it like any exposure

566.02 --> 576.85
is good exposure which does have sort of

569.26 --> 580.78
a truth to it but they in retrospect as

576.85 --> 583.12
always after the after the deed could

580.78 --> 586.9599999999999
have done a better job in making

583.12 --> 590.74
absolutely sure that no mistakes were

586.96 --> 593.83
made and there were mistakes made it's

590.74 --> 597.67
like I think it was they talked about a

593.83 --> 599.6800000000001
ring laser gyroscope while the thing was

597.67 --> 603.8199999999999
Bob it wasn't actually a ring laser

599.68 --> 605.9499999999999
gyroscope that kind of thing and it it

603.82 --> 610.45
was a mistake and look we do make

605.95 --> 614.11
mistakes a lot like life we say the

610.45 --> 614.86
wrong thing we we mistake something for

614.11 --> 618.13
something else

614.86 --> 620.53
Hey look I do it I try not to do it but

618.13 --> 622.33
even with really doing my best that

620.53 --> 625.8399999999999
trying to prevent that it happens and

622.33 --> 627.6700000000001
that should not have been part of that

625.84 --> 632.59
movie that should have been corrected

627.67 --> 634.24
and they didn't like the movie makers

632.59 --> 638.0500000000001
didn't do that didn't give the

634.24 --> 641.23
opportunity for the part people part of

638.05 --> 642.5799999999999
the Flat Earth yeah the part the flat

641.23 --> 644.08
earthers that were part of the movie

642.58 --> 647.839
didn't give them the chance to basically

644.08 --> 651.6700000000001
correct it and

647.839 --> 655.129
that's just very unfair of them and

651.67 --> 658.8789999999999
that's why I say we should make a behind

655.129 --> 661.61
the obstruction documentary the second

658.879 --> 664.61
follow-up movie completely by ourselves

661.61 --> 668.9590000000001
and we can and I know we can we don't

664.61 --> 670.999
need these freaking outsiders to do that

668.959 --> 674.569
for us we don't need the mainstream

670.999 --> 678.559
media apparatus to do that for us we can

674.569 --> 682.16
do that unlevel on par with it now I'm

678.559 --> 684.05
pretty sure we can and we should I'd

682.16 --> 688.069
love to be part of that movie if it

684.05 --> 690.079
never came to be to get all the

688.069 --> 693.4699999999999
misunderstandings out of the way

690.079 --> 697.18
and really show what's really going on

693.47 --> 700.279
not just fake hints with all kinds of

697.18 --> 706.05
conclusion like bad jumping to

700.279 --> 709.679
conclusions conclusions in it

706.05 --> 714.54
making real so that's my thing about

709.679 --> 720.209
that behind the curve

714.54 --> 723.7489999999999
what a terrible movie just painful it's

720.209 --> 726.4799999999999
almost like sitting through a live

723.749 --> 732.48
stream of Tim Osman it's just terrible

726.48 --> 736.3190000000001
benign bitter manipulative with great

732.48 --> 741.809
disdain irrational hatred and disdain

736.319 --> 749.689
for what we do with with us the flat

741.809 --> 749.689
earthers so yeah enough about that

754.129 --> 757.129
Oakley

758.38 --> 775.29
the Skeletor up in this right the rig

769.17 --> 775.29
can be good to see you flat-plane Oregon

787.29 --> 792.81
so

789.45 --> 796.38
yeah thanks everyone for coming I am

792.81 --> 798.0899999999999
open the panel is open and I put out the

796.38 --> 804.99
link for anyone who would love to join

798.09 --> 807.7800000000001
see also if you want to be part of this

804.99 --> 809.7
panel yeah and you're not in the flat

807.78 --> 814.0799999999999
earth early bird chat or in the master

809.7 --> 816.51
bee chat then talk to me talk to me

814.08 --> 817.98
through the Skype contact we do have and

816.51 --> 821.42
say hey I want to be part of this and

817.98 --> 821.4200000000001
I'll send you the link immediately

833.459 --> 838.04
a little bit of look out there

841.32 --> 846.9200000000001
see there's no controls up there now

844.199 --> 848.6099999999999
it's really blue behind those clouds

846.92 --> 855.36
looks so much better

848.61 --> 860.759
a little bit more cold I'm wearing a

855.36 --> 864.0600000000001
sweater I got my heat on at least

860.759 --> 868.11
there's no chemtrails quite happy about

864.06 --> 871.649
that I don't know what they're actually

868.11 --> 873.9590000000001
spraying every time they keep on

871.649 --> 876.69
spraying persistently for a period I

873.959 --> 881.459
just feel it they feel it that it has a

876.69 --> 884.37
bad influence on my metabolism or my

881.459 --> 886.67
health and my skin I just feel it when

884.37 --> 888.93
goes away again that kind of clears up

886.67 --> 891.68
so whatever they're spraying it just

888.93 --> 891.68
doesn't feel good

893.42 --> 903.3199999999999
so yeah that disadvantage no chemtrails

899.99 --> 905.42
a little bit that worse weather I guess

903.32 --> 907.34
I don't mind I don't mind worse weather

905.42 --> 910.03
as long as there are no chemtrails then

907.34 --> 910.0300000000001
I'm fine with that

915.82 --> 923.149
yeah and we're all ready for spring I

918.529 --> 929.54
think yeah spring is just around the

923.149 --> 932.05
corner okay Nell a McKinsey good morning

929.54 --> 932.05
willy-nilly

936.18 --> 945.87
so yeah I didn't have a drop of alcohol

941.78 --> 951.23
yesterday anyway nor did I have any kind

945.87 --> 954.9
of best smoke I'm glad I didn't glad

951.23 --> 958.1700000000001
didn't get that and I feel better now

954.9 --> 959.91
yeah I told you that I've been drinking

958.17 --> 965.4599999999999
a lot recently

959.91 --> 969.24
and smoking and just it's always nice

965.46 --> 971.7900000000001
for a while but then there's like the

969.24 --> 976.83
disadvantage just slowly start to pile

971.79 --> 978.87
on and if you keep on going more to

976.83 --> 981.7800000000001
bypass that disadvantage and the

978.87 --> 984.9
disadvantage will grow bigger in that

981.78 --> 987.26
sense I even talked to hurry about it

984.9 --> 989.75
because yeah everybody knows Hari

987.26 --> 994.59
roughly knows him heard about him and

989.75 --> 996.51
he's like drinking a lot and doesn't

994.59 --> 1000.8000000000001
like it when people address him about

996.51 --> 1004.13
that because he has his reasons but it

1000.8 --> 1006.55
just seems like he's going for more and

1004.13 --> 1010.04
more like he used to just drink beer

1006.55 --> 1013.6999999999999
then he drank more beer and even more

1010.04 --> 1015.86
beer and now he's brought a bottle of

1013.7 --> 1017.99
scotch and he's drinking it entirely

1015.86 --> 1019.8000000000001
it's just like I'm worried what are you

1017.99 --> 1023.309
doing

1019.8 --> 1026.789
like I know you like to smooth out the

1023.309 --> 1032.299
jitters and get a little confidence to

1026.789 --> 1035.1299999999999
do what you do but you need to take your

1032.299 --> 1039.049
foot off the gas pedal all call

1035.13 --> 1042.63
concerning and take a break from that

1039.049 --> 1044.8799999999999
try to get through that for a moment

1042.63 --> 1048.5100000000002
maybe you'll have one or two really

1044.88 --> 1051.0590000000002
shitty days but if you don't it's just

1048.51 --> 1055.77
gonna get worse and the toll on your

1051.059 --> 1058.8899999999999
body will will avenge itself you know

1055.77 --> 1062.94
and you need to just take a few steps

1058.89 --> 1066.8990000000001
back to get back in the game on a more

1062.94 --> 1071.3990000000001
sensible level because yeah even says it

1066.899 --> 1073.4699999999998
says I'm drunk I'm drunk and yeah are

1071.399 --> 1076.559
you really being productive in that

1073.47 --> 1080.75
sense you know because in the early days

1076.559 --> 1085.529
he was very vibrant and very snippy and

1080.75 --> 1087.029
super quick quick-witted and chose he

1085.529 --> 1090.75
even showed like one of his earlier

1087.029 --> 1092.789
episodes right in the middle of this

1090.75 --> 1097.46
hangout today and you could see it's

1092.789 --> 1097.46
just a world of difference and it yeah

1099.13 --> 1104.5400000000002
if I were him I'd just try to find a

1101.9 --> 1109.8500000000001
middle road there you know if you want

1104.54 --> 1113.12
to drink a little sure but don't don't

1109.85 --> 1115.6299999999999
chug it down don't chug it all the way

1113.12 --> 1115.6299999999999
No

1117.02 --> 1123.76
so I hope Yahoo you actually take my

1121.4 --> 1123.76
advice

1126.68 --> 1145.0900000000001
try to move on and by the way despite

1142.19 --> 1148.01
all of that even even when he's drunk he

1145.09 --> 1151.25
does actually do a pretty good job flat

1148.01 --> 1155.059
smacking he is still in that very

1151.25 --> 1157.43
creative even when he's drunk so in that

1155.059 --> 1163.46
setting okay it's not like totally

1157.43 --> 1167.059
dropping the ball but ya can't keep

1163.46 --> 1169.4
increasing that alcohol dosage every

1167.059 --> 1173.9289999999999
time it's just not healthy for you you

1169.4 --> 1179.47
know set your priorities hello and

1173.929 --> 1179.47
there's ace of people Free People

1209.79 --> 1216.289
so

1212.289 --> 1219.2
no I do not have a garden grab it hard I

1216.289 --> 1223.07
wish I did wish it a lot

1219.2 --> 1226.279
Oh what turn off the cat's eyes yeah I

1223.07 --> 1228.769
do I used to have a garden like with my

1226.279 --> 1233.269
ax we had a garden and we did gardening

1228.769 --> 1236.479
like she was very much into it I wanted

1233.269 --> 1239.619
to get into it I come from a family

1236.479 --> 1242.479
where my mother was heavily heavily into

1239.619 --> 1246.32
we in our old house we had this back

1242.479 --> 1249.349
garden that she worked on a lot and it

1246.32 --> 1252.95
was amazing it had like fruits of every

1249.349 --> 1255.649
type we had probably like 20 different

1252.95 --> 1258.529
types of fruits and berries in that one

1255.649 --> 1260.4499999999998
relatively small garden by American

1258.529 --> 1262.909
standards that's it was a very small

1260.45 --> 1267.349
garden a Dutch standard it was just

1262.909 --> 1270.8300000000002
decent okay was amazing what you can

1267.349 --> 1273.4089999999999
accomplish with the garden if you really

1270.83 --> 1277.059
put in the effort and the energy and the

1273.409 --> 1277.0590000000002
research on how to

1277.49 --> 1284.99
get that done because it's not just you

1282.2 --> 1287.029
have ground you put seeds in it or you

1284.99 --> 1288.74
put plants it in and then everything

1287.029 --> 1292.01
works by itself now you've got to give

1288.74 --> 1295.779
them the right type of ground you got to

1292.01 --> 1298.64
take care of them during the seasons

1295.779 --> 1300.679
otherwise yeah I eventually like half or

1298.64 --> 1303.7990000000002
more will just die if you don't take

1300.679 --> 1306.5900000000001
care of it it's like an orchard you need

1303.799 --> 1311.899
to take care of it doesn't work without

1306.59 --> 1316.8799999999999
human help and I'd love to do that love

1311.899 --> 1321.08
to do that again but was even suggested

1316.88 --> 1322.94
here like but there are like places here

1321.08 --> 1326.1399999999999
in the city where you can just go there

1322.94 --> 1328.94
and have like a part of that garden and

1326.14 --> 1333.5590000000002
do whatever you like in it but yeah

1328.94 --> 1335.3600000000001
there's no policies that everything has

1333.559 --> 1337.85
to be organic or something so if

1335.36 --> 1340.309
somebody right next to me besides oh I

1337.85 --> 1342.1399999999999
got lice I'm gonna now spray freakin

1340.309 --> 1345.73
poison on it yeah it's gonna get right

1342.14 --> 1349.3300000000002
in my garden that's totally unacceptable

1345.73 --> 1353.98
totally unacceptable there's nothing I

1349.33 --> 1357.25
can do with that needs to be completely

1353.98 --> 1359.559
protected from poison

1357.25 --> 1370.539
and yeah for that I need to have my own

1359.559 --> 1372.61
garden and I want it I wants it yeah and

1370.539 --> 1374.4089999999999
have it here can't haven't like on my

1372.61 --> 1377.5
dog and because everything's just gonna

1374.409 --> 1381.45
be blowing away by the wind you know is

1377.5 --> 1385.45
it's not really assorted it's I think

1381.45 --> 1390.39
right here I could I could probably try

1385.45 --> 1392.78
like a mountain type garden where yeah

1390.39 --> 1395.539
we're typical

1392.78 --> 1397.97
berries or whatever that would grow on a

1395.539 --> 1399.679
mountainside could probably even survive

1397.97 --> 1400.19
in the conditions that are present right

1399.679 --> 1407.21
here

1400.19 --> 1410.23
but yeah it's that's not really the type

1407.21 --> 1410.23
of garden that I want

1413.12 --> 1416.9399999999998
[Music]

1440.33 --> 1444.07
yeah it would be kind of funny to have

1444.28 --> 1449.86
sort of a garden with some berries here

1446.919 --> 1453.5200000000002
and there but yeah there's just these

1449.86 --> 1457.059
periods when there's these gales wind

1453.52 --> 1459.49
just gonna move past so fast that like

1457.059 --> 1461.71
the chairs on my balcony they just get

1459.49 --> 1462.309
bounced around like a freakin pinball

1461.71 --> 1467.1100000000001
machine

1462.309 --> 1470.07
this it's really too windy to get

1467.11 --> 1473.4089999999999
anything there like if you put a

1470.07 --> 1477.01
flowering pot with anything like half of

1473.409 --> 1479.0200000000002
the dirt is probably gonna blow away at

1477.01 --> 1480.549
some point it's gonna fall over tip over

1479.02 --> 1483.6399999999999
and it's gonna spill and everything's

1480.549 --> 1486.69
gonna be blown away it's not really the

1483.64 --> 1486.69
best place for a guard

1493.3 --> 1501.05
mm-hmm but yeah I love love a garden and

1498.34 --> 1503.1499999999999
I'd love chickens

1501.05 --> 1512.84
I want the whole package in that sense

1503.15 --> 1518.02
but yeah you gotta get it first many

1512.84 --> 1518.02
things left to be wanted or left wanting

1518.14 --> 1521.3500000000001
say that

1527.89 --> 1534.039
I don't know I'll get there or something

1531.12 --> 1537.4189999999999
all right yeah hanging tomato plants

1534.039 --> 1542.649
I've done that it's it's doable but

1537.419 --> 1546.76
tomato plants don't like when tomato

1542.649 --> 1549.2199999999998
plants are like quick growing weeds

1546.76 --> 1552.97
their tomatoes are like a weed they're

1549.22 --> 1555.99
very quick growing one year plants and

1552.97 --> 1559.769
they need a proper environment to work

1555.99 --> 1562.72
need to be wind free have plenty of Sun

1559.769 --> 1565.32
they have the right temperature and yeah

1562.72 --> 1568.09
if they don't just put it in the wilds

1565.32 --> 1570.639
somewhere it's not gonna grow I tried

1568.09 --> 1573.1589999999999
I'd like to have some tomato seeds and

1570.639 --> 1574.99
just try it out like okay I'm just gonna

1573.159 --> 1577.8700000000001
throw it over here just see if there's a

1574.99 --> 1586.69
plant gonna grow out of it nope doesn't

1577.87 --> 1589.09
work that way and as for cannabis I I'm

1586.69 --> 1591.7
gonna grow cannabis on my balcony here

1589.09 --> 1594.58
okay there's gonna be objections for

1591.7 --> 1597.429
sure my landlords not gonna like that

1594.58 --> 1600.1899999999998
and then everybody in the environment

1597.429 --> 1605.8890000000001
can just see like oh there is a cannabis

1600.19 --> 1607.96
plant there that's it's not something

1605.889 --> 1610.149
you want to openly advertise you know

1607.96 --> 1614.38
you're gonna have plants like that you

1610.149 --> 1616.2689999999998
want it well out of sight you don't want

1614.38 --> 1618.24
everyone in the neighborhood to see that

1616.269 --> 1620.35
and say oh yeah I'm gonna wait until

1618.24 --> 1623.769
harvesting time then I'm gonna try to

1620.35 --> 1626.7099999999998
rob it and that happened before okay

1623.769 --> 1631.779
that happened to me before in my old

1626.71 --> 1633.73
house in the 90s and we had a huge

1631.779 --> 1637.24
amount of plants and people caught on

1633.73 --> 1639.159
and then one night they just penetrated

1637.24 --> 1640.539
the garden and just ripped it all out

1639.159 --> 1644.3500000000001
they stole everything was

1640.539 --> 1645.73
heart-wrenching terrible experience I

1644.35 --> 1657.4299999999998
cared for those plants

1645.73 --> 1658.8700000000001
and it just stripped it all so yeah you

1657.43 --> 1661.45
got to be careful with these things if

1658.87 --> 1665.53
you're gonna do it even though it may be

1661.45 --> 1667.1200000000001
legal here do a certain amount still got

1665.53 --> 1670.99
to be careful because there's just a lot

1667.12 --> 1673.6299999999999
of bastards out there that that really

1670.99 --> 1678.46
don't care they just want the end result

1673.63 --> 1680.7700000000002
they're too freakin lazy or [ __ ] so

1678.46 --> 1682.72
just grow their own plants they don't

1680.77 --> 1684.67
care they're just were to do what they

1682.72 --> 1686.44
want to do when they want they want

1684.67 --> 1688.68
money they want the fruits and they're

1686.44 --> 1692.23
going to do anything for it

1688.68 --> 1696.03
I'd rather violate somebody else to just

1692.23 --> 1700.9
get it quickly than do it themselves

1696.03 --> 1705.27
it's that mindset it's a plague it's a

1700.9 --> 1705.27
cultural plague on humanity

1708.22 --> 1713.42
to put down bear traps yeah that's

1711.35 --> 1715.9299999999998
hilarious you know what I thought about

1713.42 --> 1720.5600000000002
that I thought you thought about traps

1715.93 --> 1723.44
problem is we got cats if you're gonna

1720.56 --> 1726.1699999999998
put a bear trap out there there's gonna

1723.44 --> 1729.29
be one of the cats that's probably gonna

1726.17 --> 1732.26
end up just in a fey mood start running

1729.29 --> 1735.59
and then write a run right in it snap no

1732.26 --> 1738.64
more cats so new and besides it's kind

1735.59 --> 1738.6399999999999
of illegal to do that

1745.11 --> 1750.51
but I yeah after that happened back then

1747.9 --> 1752.91
I did think like what can you do to

1750.51 --> 1756.81
prevent that from happening and the

1752.91 --> 1759.63
garden we had the entire setup just

1756.81 --> 1762.99
didn't really work we'd had to really

1759.63 --> 1765.15
totally rearrange everything build a

1762.99 --> 1768.75
closed-off fence with Locke and

1765.15 --> 1770.19
everything to get that done and at the

1768.75 --> 1773.28
time there were just weren't the

1770.19 --> 1776.1000000000001
finances to do that and it was

1773.28 --> 1778.29
squabbling in the family my dad and my

1776.1 --> 1782.37
mother had a lot of arguments it would

1778.29 --> 1785.85
never have happened just you know

1782.37 --> 1787.59
sometimes you know what you could do

1785.85 --> 1791.1899999999998
what should be done is just no

1787.59 --> 1794.33
possibility to do it it's really sad how

1791.19 --> 1794.3300000000002
that works out sometimes

1800.24 --> 1805.6490000000001
yeah yeah indeed Constance

1802.98 --> 1808.529
yeah if somebody put a bear trap out and

1805.649 --> 1811.1999999999998
in one of your cats you'll find one of

1808.529 --> 1814.11
your cats basically snapped into there

1811.2 --> 1816.659
you would feel guilty the rest of your

1814.11 --> 1819.4799999999998
freakin life such an image especially

1816.659 --> 1822.179
the way I love cats and love my cats

1819.48 --> 1826.1100000000001
that's image gonna hunt the rest of your

1822.179 --> 1836.549
life so don't recommend using bear traps

1826.11 --> 1839.779
if you got cats and besides we don't

1836.549 --> 1839.779
have bears here so

1852.64 --> 1860.8600000000001
right yep

1855.88 --> 1863.95
cats live dangerous lives and look did

1860.86 --> 1866.83
we are cats got into accidents back then

1863.95 --> 1871.0900000000001
that many we've got a couple of cats

1866.83 --> 1873.28
pretty close by in time order that got

1871.09 --> 1876.52
killed by crossing the road at the wrong

1873.28 --> 1878.77
time getting run over I think we'd like

1876.52 --> 1883.179
three of our cats died that way it was

1878.77 --> 1885.84
terrible haunts me even the memory of

1883.179 --> 1889.63
the feeling that just haunts me

1885.84 --> 1895.1499999999999
but yeah you can't really stop that you

1889.63 --> 1898.6000000000001
know it's like you you can actually

1895.15 --> 1901.24
teach cats to be more careful crossing

1898.6 --> 1905.37
the road if there's a road nearby but

1901.24 --> 1908.919
you got to be there when they are

1905.37 --> 1911.08
juvenile or adolescents and really in

1908.919 --> 1914.7700000000002
that exploration fish you got to be

1911.08 --> 1917.62
there and basically guide them like make

1914.77 --> 1919.86
them aware like yeah there you can you

1917.62 --> 1923.26
hear that cat can you hear there's a car

1919.86 --> 1928.2099999999998
engine approaching from the distance

1923.26 --> 1930.549
that means you don't do reckless jumping

1928.21 --> 1934.24
around at that moment you gotta just

1930.549 --> 1935.4089999999999
stay where you are on the side and not

1934.24 --> 1939.61
on the middle of the road you gotta

1935.409 --> 1943.39
somehow make them aware of it and with

1939.61 --> 1945.4599999999998
some of the later cats even the one that

1943.39 --> 1946.8000000000002
I had for a very long time until died

1945.46 --> 1951.8400000000001
here

1946.8 --> 1956.22
I did teach her and the funny thing was

1951.84 --> 1959.1299999999999
that catch that cat also saw me as

1956.22 --> 1962.94
parent I really took her in this like

1959.13 --> 1968.3100000000002
you are my kid and I will teach you I

1962.94 --> 1970.74
will take care of you and she did learn

1968.31 --> 1974.31
that and she never got into an accident

1970.74 --> 1975.27
even close she was very much aware like

1974.31 --> 1979.05
yeah

1975.27 --> 1981.42
cars are lethal if they move if their

1979.05 --> 1983.85
engine is on that's a sign the danger

1981.42 --> 1986.97
we've got to stay away and she did that

1983.85 --> 1989.6999999999998
and yeah that's why she ended up dying

1986.97 --> 1992.18
from natural causes enough some accident

1989.7 --> 1992.18
thank God

2015.51 --> 2018.23
hmm

2034.89 --> 2042.5400000000002
so yeah hey you guys want to talk about

2039.45 --> 2045.54
gardening or cats or raising your

2042.54 --> 2048.629
animals or whatever get on my panel

2045.54 --> 2052.32
let's get a conversation going back and

2048.629 --> 2054.72
forth it's much more fluid that way than

2052.32 --> 2059.3300000000004
if I just have to talk about whatever

2054.72 --> 2059.33
comes on the top of my mind

2062.71 --> 2068.53
then we can talk about other things as

2064.51 --> 2072.0400000000004
well although I know it's quite amusing

2068.53 --> 2074.17
in our wins jet so you guys always do

2072.04 --> 2077.47
seem to have a lot of fun there it's

2074.17 --> 2080.64
alright I don't mind if you just want to

2077.47 --> 2083.9399999999996
stay there and do that it's fine

2080.64 --> 2083.94
I'll manage

2087.51 --> 2094.71
if you can please do keep on donating to

2090.81 --> 2098.46
my super cat it's going good already

2094.71 --> 2101.52
past a two hundred dollar mark yeah

2098.46 --> 2104.79
still some way to go before I can get to

2101.52 --> 2108.39
that the amount I need for a P nine

2104.79 --> 2110.369
hundred and I don't know if it's not

2108.39 --> 2112.6189999999997
really gonna work out that quickly

2110.369 --> 2115.32
because I guess a lot of people didn't

2112.619 --> 2117.27
just like because I finally had it

2115.32 --> 2120.54
enabled thought yeah that's supporting

2117.27 --> 2122.52
right away and then yeah you're not

2120.54 --> 2125.49
gonna keep on doing that every single

2122.52 --> 2131.16
time of course money doesn't grow on

2125.49 --> 2133.74
your back I've got a money tree so I get

2131.16 --> 2138.35
that bought yeah I do really want that P

2133.74 --> 2142.5899999999997
900 so maybe maybe I should kind of take

2138.35 --> 2145.77
grantees suggestion to get it GoFundMe

2142.59 --> 2147.4500000000003
for it a special thing I don't know what

2145.77 --> 2149.67
do you guys think should I do that or

2147.45 --> 2153.2599999999998
should I just go with the super chat and

2149.67 --> 2153.26
let it roll in gradually

2155.15 --> 2163.29
because yeah a GoFundMe will probably

2158.28 --> 2166.8
get it done much more quickly and it can

2163.29 --> 2169.56
be an event in that sense like other

2166.8 --> 2171.75
people could be talking about it it's

2169.56 --> 2173.97
like how the other guys did it they did

2171.75 --> 2176.58
it the same way one that the ones that

2173.97 --> 2181.64
did it go fund me grant II didn't write

2176.58 --> 2181.64
P 1000 I think right

2183.93 --> 2191.35
and that went pretty fast got it very

2187.27 --> 2199.0
quickly so yeah I am open for doing that

2191.35 --> 2201.4
but it would be a new plan so what do

2199.0 --> 2203.8
you say should I do a GoFundMe for a

2201.4 --> 2206.67
peanut hundred or should I just stick

2203.8 --> 2206.67
through the Super chats

2210.569 --> 2220.89
they truth-seeker media mafia says talk

2217.359 --> 2220.89
about owen gardening well

2223.28 --> 2229.28
yeah oh but yeah I I kind of do talk

2227.0 --> 2232.16
more about gardening stuff also because

2229.28 --> 2235.0400000000004
going oh one does also talk about it and

2232.16 --> 2236.81
it inspires me greatly like in a way I'm

2235.04 --> 2239.0299999999997
kind of jealous of that guy it's not

2236.81 --> 2241.37
surprising though you know he has the

2239.03 --> 2242.2400000000002
freakin gardener he has a family he

2241.37 --> 2245.23
asked kids

2242.24 --> 2251.4399999999996
he has chickens and he has his dachshund

2245.23 --> 2254.06
I'm like Jared I wanted I wanted yeah

2251.44 --> 2260.86
I'm in the Netherlands it's not that

2254.06 --> 2265.16
easier I hope I will get to that point I

2260.86 --> 2269.8900000000003
do believe I could get to that point I

2265.16 --> 2269.89
believe it it's just not gonna be quick

2272.59 --> 2276.6400000000003
all right

2273.92 --> 2279.8
and yeah Constance you make a good point

2276.64 --> 2281.87
super chat is very slow but yeah it is

2279.8 --> 2283.7000000000003
kind of more interactive it's more fun

2281.87 --> 2287.7799999999997
because people can see it you can bring

2283.7 --> 2291.1099999999997
in a message you get more direct social

2287.78 --> 2298.1000000000004
reward from doing that in the open so

2291.11 --> 2302.7200000000003
yeah that that works and yeah a PayPal

2298.1 --> 2304.37
works better it does but as I said if

2302.72 --> 2306.83
you're gonna donate to my paper I'll

2304.37 --> 2309.95
probably end up using it for my own

2306.83 --> 2313.37
lights maintenance and it is up to you

2309.95 --> 2316.91
guys to think if that is a worthy cause

2313.37 --> 2319.2799999999997
or not because to me sometimes I do feel

2316.91 --> 2322.75
like I'm a black hole money-wise it's

2319.28 --> 2322.75
it's not a nice sensation

2325.75 --> 2331.76
but on the other hand yeah financially

2328.91 --> 2334.73
I'm more stable also thanks to the

2331.76 --> 2337.4300000000003
PayPal donation so far like you don't

2334.73 --> 2341.57
get to see this of our win very often or

2337.43 --> 2344.5099999999998
ever because I hide it but in the last

2341.57 --> 2347.0
year especially I have been like talking

2344.51 --> 2350.51
to friends and basically begging like ah

2347.0 --> 2353.21
can I borrow this me something might

2350.51 --> 2354.9500000000003
need something for food or it just

2353.21 --> 2357.41
doesn't work out I don't know what to do

2354.95 --> 2359.66
and of course my dad has been very

2357.41 --> 2362.8399999999997
supportive in that sense and he is doing

2359.66 --> 2365.21
well financially so yeah I don't have to

2362.84 --> 2367.3
feel guilty like I'm taking away his

2365.21 --> 2371.45
slice of bread or something doing it and

2367.3 --> 2373.8500000000004
we're both part company GTI and that's

2371.45 --> 2375.68
working out well so there is again good

2373.85 --> 2377.72
promise for the future in that sense but

2375.68 --> 2380.29
yeah there's still the now still have to

2377.72 --> 2380.29
leave now

2384.78 --> 2392.5400000000004
as I do more with my life I also need

2387.81 --> 2392.54
more food because I've been living

2394.38 --> 2400.289
Low Energy I guess just low food and

2398.309 --> 2405.779
their works out if you don't do a lot if

2400.289 --> 2407.9100000000003
you just enjoy the calm not get

2405.779 --> 2411.029
overworked out about anything don't get

2407.91 --> 2413.1299999999997
manic and like if the dude is now I'm

2411.029 --> 2416.13
gonna smack down that amount of money

2413.13 --> 2417.9
that I can actually spend because I have

2416.13 --> 2421.259
to do things now because that's the way

2417.9 --> 2423.509
you that's the way you lose a lot of

2421.259 --> 2425.969
money and I've been very disciplined and

2423.509 --> 2428.549
that's like nope I'm gonna go out no I'm

2425.969 --> 2430.859
not gonna do this not gonna do that

2428.549 --> 2433.109
because I can't afford it just have to

2430.859 --> 2435.69
pay for my rent and my food and just

2433.109 --> 2442.609
keep it all to minimum no cookies no

2435.69 --> 2445.2290000000003
cookies for our win and that worked but

2442.609 --> 2447.779
can't work forever you can't just sit

2445.229 --> 2452.819
still forever like that and it's moving

2447.779 --> 2455.819
further and with the GTI and the help

2452.819 --> 2458.67
from you guys over my paypal that yeah

2455.819 --> 2461.759
it is working I'm eating slightly more

2458.67 --> 2467.489
reduced on average I eat slightly more

2461.759 --> 2469.89
and it feels better it's it's funny how

2467.489 --> 2473.9990000000003
that works because if you eat less and

2469.89 --> 2475.3799999999997
you don't overdo things then it works

2473.999 --> 2477.509
kind of works

2475.38 --> 2480.599
although the psychological long-term

2477.509 --> 2482.369
burden will be growing like this it's

2480.599 --> 2486.96
kind of sense of dissatisfaction this

2482.369 --> 2489.0
grow over time but

2486.96 --> 2492.119
yeah if I just get more food I'm not

2489.0 --> 2493.98
gonna throw fat never grow fat I could

2492.119 --> 2496.7400000000002
probably eat twice as much as I do now

2493.98 --> 2498.96
and they'll never grow fat but it will

2496.74 --> 2501.45
bring me more energy it will help me

2498.96 --> 2503.25
overcome obstacles easier it will bring

2501.45 --> 2506.819
me more confidence all that like it

2503.25 --> 2508.98
really does especially because I eat

2506.819 --> 2515.0099999999998
purely organic and that just works so

2508.98 --> 2518.819
much more efficient and yeah I I am

2515.01 --> 2522.75
climbing out of that overly efficient

2518.819 --> 2526.41
mode the saving mode I guess energy

2522.75 --> 2528.21
saving modes I'm getting out of it and I

2526.41 --> 2531.1189999999997
kind of have to cuz I have a Daily Show

2528.21 --> 2534.299
now and it's just can't be on safe mode

2531.119 --> 2537.4500000000003
and do that constantly because it takes

2534.299 --> 2541.74
more energy and you can't can't get

2537.45 --> 2544.3489999999997
boring so I'm getting out of it and it's

2541.74 --> 2546.9199999999996
working this it's still working so I'm

2544.349 --> 2546.92
happy about that

2551.48 --> 2556.54
and yeah the future is looking good for

2554.33 --> 2556.54
me

2557.3 --> 2563.1800000000003
on the short run at least or short run

2561.17 --> 2569.2000000000003
like the next year is looking pretty

2563.18 --> 2569.2
good it's only gonna be better

2583.96 --> 2589.09
yeah she want to help me out like the

2586.39 --> 2595.39
more I get the the better it'll go and

2589.09 --> 2600.7200000000003
and I will discipline myself it's a

2595.39 --> 2605.47
wrong word muster some discipline to not

2600.72 --> 2607.8399999999997
get drunk on wealth like oh my god I got

2605.47 --> 2611.7999999999997
so much money now that means I can just

2607.84 --> 2614.08
buy that extra expensive thingy because

2611.8 --> 2617.73
it makes me feel rich I I got over that

2614.08 --> 2620.56
[ __ ] got over that [ __ ] ten years ago I

2617.73 --> 2624.01
went through a cycle like that after my

2620.56 --> 2625.81
mother died and the house was sold yeah

2624.01 --> 2629.0800000000004
that beautiful house with that garden

2625.81 --> 2630.85
that I'll never see back it's so whole

2629.08 --> 2632.7999999999997
in my heart that's probably never got to

2630.85 --> 2635.95
be filled until I have something to

2632.8 --> 2638.38
replace it with have a house of my own

2635.95 --> 2640.2999999999997
with a beautiful garden and fruits and

2638.38 --> 2643.15
everything till that time it's never

2640.3 --> 2645.1600000000003
gonna heal really but I didn't get a lot

2643.15 --> 2648.63
of money out of it a huge amount of

2645.16 --> 2652.24
money the most money I've ever had and

2648.63 --> 2655.9
trying to hold back not to spend it all

2652.24 --> 2659.41
and kind of work I find a middle road I

2655.9 --> 2661.15
did buy a couple more expensive things

2659.41 --> 2664.69
that I probably normally wouldn't buy

2661.15 --> 2666.37
like a little bit more high tech TV that

2664.69 --> 2668.29
kind of thing but it didn't like the

2666.37 --> 2671.2599999999998
biggest cuz I didn't want to throw all

2668.29 --> 2673.0
my money away all at once and I did buy

2671.26 --> 2676.2400000000002
the things that I did that were slightly

2673.0 --> 2679.27
more expensive in mind that yeah it is

2676.24 --> 2681.7
gonna have to last a long time it has

2679.27 --> 2684.7
any of the things that I bought during

2681.7 --> 2689.0099999999998
that time the inheritance money still

2684.7 --> 2691.6
lasts to this day although yeah my pants

2689.01 --> 2694.3700000000003
for example were one of those things

2691.6 --> 2696.92
like tailor-made

2694.37 --> 2698.3599999999997
they lasted like ten years but now

2696.92 --> 2700.06
they're yeah

2698.36 --> 2701.78
they don't last longer than that

2700.06 --> 2707.0
especially if you're gonna wear them

2701.78 --> 2709.75
every single day to pair know about like

2707.0 --> 2712.19
my washing machine is still there

2709.75 --> 2713.06
freezer is still there my refrigerator

2712.19 --> 2715.73
they all still work

2713.06 --> 2721.09
I bought them with in mind this is gonna

2715.73 --> 2724.4900000000002
have to last a very long time and I

2721.09 --> 2728.6800000000003
still got things from that time so it

2724.49 --> 2728.68
wasn't all just a pure waste thank God

2731.08 --> 2737.44
anyway this is just this is our winning

2734.48 --> 2737.44
background [ __ ]

2744.15 --> 2750.71
yeah and I'm just glad that didn't get

2747.33 --> 2753.09
to like eight points poverty wise after

2750.71 --> 2755.52
kicked out like financially everything

2753.09 --> 2759.6600000000003
print crashed absolutely crashed after

2755.52 --> 2761.97
I've my kicked me out and I'm just glad

2759.66 --> 2764.22
that I didn't literally have to throw

2761.97 --> 2767.2799999999997
everything away I got and sell

2764.22 --> 2769.2599999999998
everything else just to be able to

2767.28 --> 2772.44
survive or anything like that I'm so

2769.26 --> 2774.42
glad but I still have stuff even though

2772.44 --> 2774.75
I can all put it in my room I still have

2774.42 --> 2782.88
it

2774.75 --> 2786.5
and still hope to put it back in my own

2782.88 --> 2792.42
house my own more than one little room

2786.5 --> 2795.6
so it can be used again it's gonna

2792.42 --> 2798.63
happen and when it's when it's the time

2795.6 --> 2803.25
I'll I promise you I will give you a

2798.63 --> 2805.85
tour I will show you what I've been

2803.25 --> 2805.85
saving up

2810.38 --> 2812.98
yeah

2823.48 --> 2834.19
and Brenda the brand em lost his family

2829.66 --> 2839.68
last year says it's so sad man that's

2834.19 --> 2843.73
really sucks it's terrible if you really

2839.68 --> 2847.839
have a home and you grow up in there and

2843.73 --> 2851.64
like still have the memories of how it

2847.839 --> 2857.14
was to you the magic you experienced and

2851.64 --> 2859.5099999999998
that that's just it's no longer yours

2857.14 --> 2861.519
it's gone people are not gonna see that

2859.51 --> 2864.13
magic and they're just gonna rearrange

2861.519 --> 2865.99
things every the way they want it's

2864.13 --> 2869.799
gonna be lost yeah that same experience

2865.99 --> 2870.9399999999996
happened to me like I was in a home that

2869.799 --> 2874.21
was paradise

2870.94 --> 2880.0
it was paradise outside it was the most

2874.21 --> 2883.63
amazing paradise or garden I've ever

2880.0 --> 2885.069
come across it was beautiful and fruits

2883.63 --> 2888.9700000000003
everywhere you could just pick them off

2885.069 --> 2894.42
the trees let me just sum up a little

2888.97 --> 2899.64

2943.86 --> 2952.4
made actual made ice cream with that

2946.89 --> 2952.4
stuff fruit punch

2953.65 --> 2959.7400000000002
it was amazing like every every after

2956.769 --> 2963.339
summer it was just amazing we had like

2959.74 --> 2965.9799999999996
the most amazing food and we had too

2963.339 --> 2967.63
much of it we actually asked people like

2965.98 --> 2969.549
yeah come over come over we have all

2967.63 --> 2973.3900000000003
this fruit please take it because it's

2969.549 --> 2975.609
too much we can't we can eat all of this

2973.39 --> 2978.009
we can don't even have the storage room

2975.609 --> 2981.22
to process it into something into jelly

2978.009 --> 2986.23
and then storage just too much ah so

2981.22 --> 2988.74
amazing so amazing what a great time

2986.23 --> 2988.7400000000002
that was

2997.25 --> 3007.63
I have a a bunny as well they're like a

3001.27 --> 3010.66
black mini long era bunny we basically

3007.63 --> 3013.7200000000003
called it licorice but the Dutch it's

3010.66 --> 3016.5989999999997
like topia licorice because there's such

3013.72 --> 3019.81
cute little bunny even a dog

3016.599 --> 3023.23
Lille and so enthusiastic we gave it

3019.81 --> 3026.19
like we had a grass patch and the tree

3023.23 --> 3029.56
in the middle and we gave it like a

3026.19 --> 3032.02
small fence and it would be there and

3029.56 --> 3032.83
that that creature was just afraid of

3032.02 --> 3038.38
nothing

3032.83 --> 3042.73
dogs cats it would just run up to it

3038.38 --> 3044.65
like hey you're there yeah and like cats

3042.73 --> 3047.29
would like blue [ __ ] what's that and you

3044.65 --> 3049.06
run away because that type of enthusiasm

3047.29 --> 3052.9
they don't expect it I love that

3049.06 --> 3056.23
creature and it probably yeah

3052.9 --> 3058.869
at one point we just lost it it probably

3056.23 --> 3061.69
it had been digging holes it probably

3058.869 --> 3063.839
got stuck in one at some point so it's

3061.69 --> 3067.089
still there on the ground

3063.839 --> 3069.69
too bad it's got so many good memories

3067.089 --> 3069.69
there

3075.48 --> 3081.29
yeah Cheers to life

3090.91 --> 3094.68
yeah and what's funny because even then

3094.859 --> 3103.5389999999998
even then like my mother was into a

3097.75 --> 3105.94
herbalism lot and all these old books

3103.539 --> 3107.65
about herbs and how we can use these

3105.94 --> 3110.23
plants and that plants and she

3107.65 --> 3113.19
experimented with them with food

3110.23 --> 3116.799
sometimes and we use certain things

3113.19 --> 3120.579
medicinally it was very fascinating is

3116.799 --> 3125.309
it like willow tree leaves it's very

3120.579 --> 3128.549
fascinating that willow tree leaves has

3125.309 --> 3131.8590000000004
aspirin properties to it does

3128.549 --> 3137.829
fascinating and you could use it like

3131.859 --> 3139.75
that and it's sour though but yeah

3137.829 --> 3142.029
that's one of those things I learned and

3139.75 --> 3143.92
there were other plants like I don't

3142.029 --> 3149.5
even know the English name but like

3143.92 --> 3151.809
ground weed type plants that you could

3149.5 --> 3154.329
just take a leaf and then rub it over

3151.809 --> 3157.15
your skin if you had like mosquito bites

3154.329 --> 3159.67
and it worked really great and I learned

3157.15 --> 3163.349
all these things from my mother because

3159.67 --> 3167.099
she was really into that it's my first

3163.349 --> 3167.099
druid training

3169.83 --> 3180.19
I've always a huge huge massive sympathy

3173.95 --> 3184.56
for for animal and plant life it's part

3180.19 --> 3184.56
of me it's not going away

3208.76 --> 3214.51
yep yeah Constance it would although

3212.3 --> 3217.19
it's not for everyone

3214.51 --> 3220.19
you're kind of hot you got to have a

3217.19 --> 3223.9700000000003
knack for it you got to have a the

3220.19 --> 3225.89
natural room in your head to be able to

3223.97 --> 3230.81
absorb all that information because it's

3225.89 --> 3238.19
so much so many plants so it's insane

3230.81 --> 3240.92
it's it's very similar to like yeah I

3238.19 --> 3244.1
know everything about bugs do you do you

3240.92 --> 3246.08
so can you name all the six million

3244.1 --> 3250.2799999999997
different types of bugs that are out

3246.08 --> 3251.96
there well yeah plants there's a lot of

3250.28 --> 3256.7000000000003
plants Hey

3251.96 --> 3259.13
that's and they all do something they

3256.7 --> 3262.7
all do something some are poisonous some

3259.13 --> 3266.81
are can be used for medical benefits

3262.7 --> 3268.9399999999996
some have weird synergies like okay

3266.81 --> 3271.34
there's this plant and there's that

3268.94 --> 3272.87
plant and they both work fine but if you

3271.34 --> 3275.7200000000003
put them in the ground next to each

3272.87 --> 3278.45
other then for some reason the roots

3275.72 --> 3281.5
cooperate and they both work better one

3278.45 --> 3284.5099999999998
of these examples is a tomato plant and

3281.5 --> 3288.89
basil plants they have a natural synergy

3284.51 --> 3291.9500000000003
so funny because even in in traditional

3288.89 --> 3295.31
cooking like a Mediterranean cooking

3291.95 --> 3296.99
yeah tomatoes basil they're always used

3295.31 --> 3299.27
together anyway it's like even when you

3296.99 --> 3301.37
eat them they have a synergy but as

3299.27 --> 3303.59
plants as living plants they have

3301.37 --> 3306.17
synergies and this is fascinating and

3303.59 --> 3308.36
there's more studies even on this like

3306.17 --> 3312.98
what plants have what types of synergies

3308.36 --> 3315.77
and how can you then arrange the spots

3312.98 --> 3319.34
in a garden where you put certain plants

3315.77 --> 3321.95
and how like schematics of efficient

3319.34 --> 3324.9500000000003
synergy gardening that that was a thing

3321.95 --> 3327.3199999999997
like my ex was into that was very much

3324.95 --> 3330.3799999999997
into that and fascinating works really

3327.32 --> 3331.6800000000003
really interesting so much there's so

3330.38 --> 3335.309
much to plants

3331.68 --> 3338.589
you can spend an entire lifetime

3335.309 --> 3342.19
specializing on it and dying not having

3338.589 --> 3344.46
learned everything so much so much you

3342.19 --> 3344.46
can do

3362.52 --> 3370.2
you want to see a bow it's right there

3366.2 --> 3374.22
there it is you see it it's there it's a

3370.2 --> 3377.16
boat get over it and I'm gonna

3374.22 --> 3378.0499999999997
demonstrate it here I already did that

3377.16 --> 3380.3999999999996
once

3378.05 --> 3382.9700000000003
it's a bow it's really not that

3380.4 --> 3382.9700000000003
interesting

3396.01 --> 3401.96
and look hey as soon as I get some on

3400.07 --> 3406.52
the road life streaming capabilities I

3401.96 --> 3408.26
will do stuff with it okay I will do

3406.52 --> 3410.39
stuff with it but as long as I don't

3408.26 --> 3413.7700000000004
have that capability it's just gonna be

3410.39 --> 3413.77
a prop hanging in the background

3419.41 --> 3422.8799999999997
because I did have to plant

3423.03 --> 3431.25
a gimmick to start shooting Globes globe

3427.56 --> 3434.85
earths with my bow would make some good

3431.25 --> 3438.23
practice and L had I erased video so I

3434.85 --> 3438.23
absolutely want to do that

3454.0 --> 3458.98
right

3456.01 --> 3461.55
yeah Constance you're right about

3458.98 --> 3464.65
gardening and there's even more to it

3461.55 --> 3466.3300000000004
much more because it's not just the

3464.65 --> 3467.65
properties of the plants and everything

3466.33 --> 3474.67
and everything you can learn about it

3467.65 --> 3478.81
there's also the amazing thing that it's

3474.67 --> 3481.33
proven proven psychologically if you

3478.81 --> 3486.49
work with your hands with your fingers

3481.33 --> 3489.75
in the dirt it relieves tension social

3486.49 --> 3494.47
tension psychological tension if that's

3489.75 --> 3496.18
Reuven proven statistically that that

3494.47 --> 3501.0299999999997
actually work they did the research it's

3496.18 --> 3504.43
proven that it does that end and also

3501.03 --> 3507.07
exposing yourself to actual healthy soil

3504.43 --> 3510.1299999999997
and dirt and everything the complex

3507.07 --> 3513.94
micro eco system that is in within it

3510.13 --> 3517.33
also enhances your immune system it

3513.94 --> 3520.359
makes you more healthy and if you have

3517.33 --> 3522.58
little kids that like in the face where

3520.359 --> 3525.0099999999998
they put [ __ ] I'm gonna [ __ ] hopefully

3522.58 --> 3529.6
but stuff in their mouth yeah it's good

3525.01 --> 3533.26
to have them actually put dirt healthy

3529.6 --> 3535.99
soil in their mouth it'll be a huge

3533.26 --> 3539.4100000000003
benefit for them later in life if they

3535.99 --> 3544.2099999999996
do if you let them do that huge benefits

3539.41 --> 3548.109
so there is so much so much the nature

3544.21 --> 3552.94
that benefits mankind if you just take

3548.109 --> 3555.21
your time to actually do it and be part

3552.94 --> 3555.21
of it

3556.96 --> 3563.38
right oh good good on you Stuart F

3560.02 --> 3566.829
that's great I so did I my parents my

3563.38 --> 3569.8
mother knew she would let me like yeah

3566.829 --> 3571.21
and even like oh look at that

3569.8 --> 3574.3590000000004
oh look at that you can put the head in

3571.21 --> 3576.76
her pockets she'd actually do that this

3574.359 --> 3579.88
is awesome I'm so thankful that she did

3576.76 --> 3584.0200000000004
that otherwise I'd probably be a giant

3579.88 --> 3586.54
mess of allergies because I think that

3584.02 --> 3592.0
my grandmother didn't do it with my

3586.54 --> 3595.39
mother and my mother had massive trouble

3592.0 --> 3597.099
with allergies all our life they

3595.39 --> 3600.0589999999997
probably ended up killing her in the

3597.099 --> 3603.01
sense that because of it she went into

3600.059 --> 3605.4100000000003
pharmaceuticals and then one after

3603.01 --> 3607.8590000000004
another and that probably killed her

3605.41 --> 3611.3799999999997
that was probably what really killed her

3607.859 --> 3614.41
and I'm not never gonna let that happen

3611.38 --> 3617.4100000000003
to me ever I've learned from my mother

3614.41 --> 3620.7599999999998
in that sense I learned from her in life

3617.41 --> 3620.7599999999998
and I learned from our in death

3622.37 --> 3629.66
and even though I do have potential for

3626.15 --> 3634.82
allergies that it is because I maintain

3629.66 --> 3638.66
my health so so drastically so dedicated

3634.82 --> 3640.8500000000004
that that's never gonna happen and even

3638.66 --> 3643.6099999999997
if I would have allergies I would I

3640.85 --> 3646.45
would rather just sit through them try

3643.61 --> 3650.1800000000003
to live with it then go to some

3646.45 --> 3652.22
pharmaceutical [ __ ] to try and stay the

3650.18 --> 3657.04
symptoms because it's only gonna make

3652.22 --> 3657.04
things worse probably you know

3657.82 --> 3661.3590000000004
can't speak for everyone out there of

3659.859 --> 3664.54
course look there's people out there

3661.359 --> 3668.04
that just have severe allergies severe

3664.54 --> 3670.93
deadly allergies can't speak for them

3668.04 --> 3678.64
you know once you got the problem you

3670.93 --> 3682.3489999999997
got the problem but yeah

3678.64 --> 3686.519
you can try to work to prevent that

3682.349 --> 3690.4300000000003
don't get any freaking vaccines don't

3686.519 --> 3695.43
expose your kids to GMO or pesticides of

3690.43 --> 3695.43
any type ever let them eat dirt

3695.759 --> 3701.7690000000002
breastfeed them and be very careful what

3699.099 --> 3705.759
you eat when you breastfeed them all

3701.769 --> 3709.0589999999997
these things matter so much it is such a

3705.759 --> 3712.45
huge life quality difference when you do

3709.059 --> 3716.829
this for your kids such a uterus they

3712.45 --> 3719.049
will be thankful forever if you do that

3716.829 --> 3721.2690000000002
even when you're gone they're still

3719.049 --> 3726.549
going to be thankful it's it's a matter

3721.269 --> 3729.819
of species survival or really it is you

3726.549 --> 3730.15
got to do it you can't afford not to do

3729.819 --> 3732.989
it

3730.15 --> 3732.989
you got to do it

3739.28 --> 3742.1800000000003
anyway

3748.45 --> 3753.45
yeah I'm gonna round out the show Flat

3751.03 --> 3756.4300000000003
Earth debates have already started and

3753.45 --> 3759.81
hold on long enough but it was nice it

3756.43 --> 3763.2999999999997
was a nice 100th in first episode and

3759.81 --> 3767.14
yeah I appreciate all of you coming it

3763.3 --> 3769.4500000000003
was good it's good to talk about nature

3767.14 --> 3772.99
and gardening and all the advantages of

3769.45 --> 3777.52
herbalism and what you need to do if you

3772.99 --> 3779.3199999999997
got kids you know and also by the way if

3777.52 --> 3783.07
you do have kids and you don't have a

3779.32 --> 3786.8500000000004
garden or anything be careful where you

3783.07 --> 3789.5800000000004
drop them off to feed them dirt you got

3786.85 --> 3794.68
it you got to know where you're putting

3789.58 --> 3798.58
them like is that ground not polluted do

3794.68 --> 3802.81
the they're the the forest management

3798.58 --> 3805.45
not dump [ __ ] there do they not use

3802.81 --> 3807.64
pesticides like it's almost like before

3805.45 --> 3811.33
you put your kid there you want to have

3807.64 --> 3814.99
a water and ground sample checked by a

3811.33 --> 3816.91
laboratory really because if you just

3814.99 --> 3819.97
look oh look there's trees you're know

3816.91 --> 3822.91
yeah sure well you might end up actually

3819.97 --> 3824.89
having them shove dirt with pesticides

3822.91 --> 3826.24
or whatever remnants of it in your in

3824.89 --> 3829.7799999999997
their mouth and that's not gonna be good

3826.24 --> 3831.2799999999997
so be very careful the quality of dirt

3829.78 --> 3834.82
you're gonna have them shove in their

3831.28 --> 3838.1400000000003
mouths check it check it before you do

3834.82 --> 3842.77
it and also if you get in a new house

3838.14 --> 3844.87
with a garden check the ground you don't

3842.77 --> 3846.7
know what the previous owners have been

3844.87 --> 3850.15
doing with it there might have been

3846.7 --> 3852.3399999999997
really reckless you might end up having

3850.15 --> 3855.31
to just completely replace all of the

3852.34 --> 3858.07
dirt there just scoop it out throw it

3855.31 --> 3859.52
away or whatever and just fill it up

3858.07 --> 3863.75
with really clean

3859.52 --> 3868.78
organic soil before you do anything with

3863.75 --> 3871.49
it the that's gardening tips with Arwen

3868.78 --> 3875.2400000000002
so yeah I am gonna run out the show now

3871.49 --> 3877.2799999999997
so thank you everyone for coming please
