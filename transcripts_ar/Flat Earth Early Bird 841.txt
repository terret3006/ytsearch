still tried to compose myself a little

165.68 --> 171.84

167.76 --> 171.84
all right

176.72 --> 180.48
any chance i can get nathan to pronounce

179.519 --> 185.12

huh hey amanda young you're going to a

197.28 --> 200.239

224.56 --> 228.879
should have there's lots of stuff

226.64 --> 233.27999999999997
happening

228.879 --> 233.28
flat earth debates went on

233.68 --> 238.64000000000001
pretty long and even after the show had

237.28 --> 240.159
ended

238.64 --> 243.76
the after aftershow had ended we were

240.159 --> 243.76
still on for quite a while

243.84 --> 252.239
uh but i was distracted by

248.239 --> 252.239
tea time with gary and terry

252.319 --> 256.159
that was kind of happening at the same

253.92 --> 256.159
time

257.44 --> 262.239
that was good stuff with owen benjamin

259.919 --> 262.239
uh

262.8 --> 269.199
right later

265.919 --> 272.24
yeah brandon brandon toy went

269.199 --> 275.04
live and i actually got on that panel

272.24 --> 275.04
for the first time

275.759 --> 278.639
that was interesting

281.84 --> 284.96
so yeah i got in there

285.12 --> 291.04
it was yeah quite rowdy it it seems to

288.32 --> 294.4
be typically kind of rowdy over there

291.04 --> 297.52000000000004
but yeah i had my moments there and

294.4 --> 300.15999999999997
it was pretty fun to be at brampus in

297.52 --> 300.15999999999997
there as well

302.8 --> 305.039
so

308.88 --> 314.96

hold on

338.08 --> 347.68
hold on how am i gonna find this

343.52 --> 347.68
let's do it through the notifications

350.84 --> 353.919
right

352.08 --> 356.32
i think it's basically randy's old

353.919 --> 356.32
channel

358.96 --> 362.96
anyway here's the link so you can check

361.919 --> 366.08
it out

362.96 --> 368.96
and i was on there yesterday

366.08 --> 369.44
and hey i might just be going there more

368.96 --> 371.039
often

369.44 --> 380.4
i thought it was a pretty interesting

371.039 --> 382.88
place to hang around

380.4 --> 384.88
all right yeah chris chris la jambe

382.88 --> 387.84
hello

384.88 --> 390.24
yeah i heard too about the boulder

387.84 --> 390.23999999999995
shooting

390.8 --> 394.08
it's a boulder there's always something

392.479 --> 397.12
going on there in colorado

394.08 --> 397.12
it's crazy town

405.28 --> 408.96
i think also it used to be uh mark

408.0 --> 412.56
sargent's

408.96 --> 413.919
hometown or maybe that was just a while

412.56 --> 416.479
anyway i remember

413.919 --> 419.68
boulder first because he used to mention

416.479 --> 421.599
that on his stream like in 2015 on a

419.68 --> 424.319
regular basis

421.599 --> 424.88
but uh yeah did some crazy stuff coming

424.319 --> 429.44
out there

424.88 --> 432.319
periodically through the news

429.44 --> 434.56
and yeah apparently yesterday the

432.319 --> 436.8
shooting

434.56 --> 438.24
i i don't know much about it i haven't

436.8 --> 441.039
seen

438.24 --> 444.639
much video evidence or anything i just

441.039 --> 444.639
didn't get too deeply into it

446.56 --> 454.24
right i did pick up on some other stuff

449.68 --> 454.24
however posted some links

457.919 --> 463.919
and especially this one is that

459.68 --> 466.96
apparently there is an israeli petition

463.919 --> 470.71999999999997
to the international criminal court

466.96 --> 474.08
for the mandatory vaccinations

470.72 --> 476.24
and yeah i

474.08 --> 478.15999999999997
i'm not going to directly claim any

476.24 --> 478.879
credit but that was kind of what i had

478.16 --> 481.28000000000003
hoped for

478.879 --> 483.199
that that would happen that's why he

481.28 --> 486.31899999999996
called it like hey did you know there is

483.199 --> 489.52000000000004
a holocaust happening right now

486.319 --> 490.84000000000003
all that yeah because that was going on

489.52 --> 493.52
over there

490.84 --> 495.84
and now this morning i haven't really

493.52 --> 499.19899999999996
looked into it too deeply i also

495.84 --> 499.19899999999996
saw that apparently

499.84 --> 503.35999999999996
medical staff in the uk is also getting

502.879 --> 507.03900000000004
this

503.36 --> 509.599
supposed mandate

507.039 --> 511.759
don't know exactly what that means but

509.599 --> 520.0
it's not good thing

511.759 --> 525.6
it's very upsetting to hear that

520.0 --> 528.08
also uh was it again

525.6 --> 529.0400000000001
we had some conversations yesterday too

528.08 --> 532.08
was uh

529.04 --> 535.8389999999999
during during the flat earth debate like

532.08 --> 535.839
i had an appointment at four o'clock

535.92 --> 540.399
to continue the process with my landlord

538.88 --> 542.32
situation

540.399 --> 545.44
and i found out that actually my social

542.32 --> 548.9590000000001
worker is somebody that is a

545.44 --> 550.24
a dedicated protester he said like he

548.959 --> 552.7199999999999
actually goes to

550.24 --> 554.399
amsterdam like every weekend for this

552.72 --> 557.2
protest that is in the news

554.399 --> 559.279
with those well those violent military

557.2 --> 561.6800000000001
police and all that

559.279 --> 563.36
so he's right there made me kind of

561.68 --> 566.8
proud

563.36 --> 568.08
to be associated indirectly but that was

566.8 --> 570.64
interesting and

568.08 --> 571.6800000000001
so we did kind of like some background

570.64 --> 575.6
tactical talk

571.68 --> 577.5999999999999
for just yet how to safeguard the

575.6 --> 579.44
netherlands for this crazy situation

577.6 --> 582.8000000000001
that's unfolding

579.44 --> 584.8000000000001
pretty much everywhere uh and then this

582.8 --> 589.1999999999999
morning

584.8 --> 593.5999999999999
kind of unexpected the police came

589.2 --> 596.5600000000001
yeah came by for like a casual visit

593.6 --> 598.399
like i woke up with that so just i was

596.56 --> 600.2399999999999
just sleeping at a pretty good night

598.399 --> 601.839
rest and then they come back

600.24 --> 603.519
and i was like oh [ __ ] i didn't do

601.839 --> 608.0790000000001
anything wrong did i

603.519 --> 610.8
no no no okay they just i had

608.079 --> 614.56
mentioned in my uh when i went to the

610.8 --> 614.56
police when is it a week ago

615.04 --> 618.8
that i had indeed interest to contact

617.279 --> 622.0
the

618.8 --> 625.12
uh you call that the the neighborhood

622.0 --> 626.959
cop it's like

625.12 --> 629.44
a person that typically is like a

626.959 --> 631.5189999999999
contact person through the police

629.44 --> 633.6
who knows people in neighborhood and all

631.519 --> 636.5600000000001
that typically

633.6 --> 639.519
it's like an art like a social arbiter

636.56 --> 643.1999999999999
is pretty cool guy by the way

639.519 --> 645.12
and lady as well but yeah i had a

643.2 --> 647.279
conversation

645.12 --> 649.6
basically me explaining the situation

647.279 --> 652.56
again they're sizing it up they

649.6 --> 655.6800000000001
yeah so that was pretty good even though

652.56 --> 658.16
apparently somebody had been spying

655.68 --> 659.519
for the landlord again so suddenly

658.16 --> 662.3199999999999
roommate came down with

659.519 --> 664.0
mobile phone like yeah the landlord

662.32 --> 667.839
wants to talk to you cops

664.0 --> 670.399
like what the hell so

667.839 --> 672.839
yeah that was not very pleasant to

670.399 --> 674.399
notice that

672.839 --> 677.6
again

674.399 --> 680.48
just seems like i'm being spied on

677.6 --> 681.12
right but i hadn't done anything right

680.48 --> 685.519
nobody

681.12 --> 685.519
actually called them so

687.36 --> 694.88
right so that was pretty much uh was it

691.519 --> 694.88
45 minutes ago

696.48 --> 703.839
so yeah i've been very busy

714.839 --> 719.6
right

716.959 --> 720.88
yeah dank i have not heard any details

719.6 --> 723.36
about it either

720.88 --> 725.04
like my mind was not set to it at the

723.36 --> 727.279
time so i kind of heard it in the

725.04 --> 729.5999999999999
background i haven't dug into it

727.279 --> 731.519
like i'm not really in the mood for that

729.6 --> 734.88
sort of thing right now there's so much

731.519 --> 737.68
stuff going on i'm not really

734.88 --> 739.8389999999999
wanting to start figuring out is this a

737.68 --> 743.04
false flag or was this real what

739.839 --> 745.839
is this it's just not the right timing

743.04 --> 745.8389999999999
for me

750.72 --> 753.279
okay

756.079 --> 762.079
fake and gay uh if you say so james

759.839 --> 762.0790000000001
brown

764.399 --> 768.32
like on the surface it didn't really

766.24 --> 772.9590000000001
seem like something that was real

768.32 --> 777.0400000000001
but that's just on the surface

772.959 --> 779.1999999999999
i hadn't really dug deeper into it

777.04 --> 780.3199999999999
usually when these things happen there's

779.2 --> 782.399
some very

780.32 --> 785.12
there's a if it's real there's some real

782.399 --> 788.399
live footage that just shows some

785.12 --> 790.8
unmistakable things and all that didn't

788.399 --> 793.6
pick that up on that

790.8 --> 793.5999999999999
so i don't know

798.839 --> 801.839
uh

829.44 --> 832.9590000000001
right so yeah i'm pretty much up for

832.16 --> 836.639
whatever

832.959 --> 836.6389999999999
you guys want to talk about

841.519 --> 843.839
hmm

859.839 --> 865.519
rats in control of media putting out

862.24 --> 868.839
shows it's back to normal okay

865.519 --> 871.839
i don't know what that means george

868.839 --> 871.839
sanford

874.399 --> 879.44
hello creation bear am i watching crow

920.16 --> 923.4399999999999
democrats putting out phony fake shows

922.56 --> 927.279

923.44 --> 930.9590000000001
everything they put out

927.279 --> 932.88

930.959 --> 941.8389999999999
political players like that

932.88 --> 941.8389999999999
from that side since the 90s

944.16 --> 947.4399999999999

946.8 --> 953.04

947.44 --> 955.839
this is i just didn't spot it back then

1166.88 --> 1174.3200000000002
any news on steve no i do i uh well

1171.76 --> 1176.559
like he sometimes pops by in chat i

1174.32 --> 1181.9189999999999
think i saw him yesterday in here or

1176.559 --> 1181.9189999999999
the day before just saying hello

1183.36 --> 1186.9599999999998
other than that i'm not really keeping

1185.52 --> 1193.84
track

1186.96 --> 1193.8400000000001
of what he's doing tom parker

1195.039 --> 1200.08
sold some gold and silver today really

1197.36 --> 1200.08
dutch sailor

1204.0 --> 1207.84
why did you sell it

1213.28 --> 1218.96
okay that's it you read about it too

1216.559 --> 1221.84
the police for freedom taking it with a

1218.96 --> 1223.919
grain of salt well maybe

1221.84 --> 1225.76
well it would actually be good very good

1223.919 --> 1227.3600000000001
to just take it under the loop see who

1225.76 --> 1231.6
they are

1227.36 --> 1233.84
and if it's not some

1231.6 --> 1234.9599999999998
weird controlled opposition situation

1233.84 --> 1237.6
but i kind of doubt

1234.96 --> 1237.6000000000001
that it is

1244.32 --> 1248.8799999999999
like in a ways it's been long overdue

1247.12 --> 1250.799
like this should have been

1248.88 --> 1252.48
happening like even last year but maybe

1250.799 --> 1253.679
it is maybe it's just now getting

1252.48 --> 1255.76
attention or seeking

1253.679 --> 1256.96
attention because it thinks the group

1255.76 --> 1263.84
thinks they can handle it

1256.96 --> 1263.8400000000001
or it's necessary

1264.32 --> 1268.08
all right that's it good to know

1275.919 --> 1278.96
hello aaron brown

1284.799 --> 1291.84
found half a kilogram found it

1288.48 --> 1291.84
where did you find it

1292.48 --> 1305.84
that's i wish i would just

1295.52 --> 1310.0
find that sort of thing

1305.84 --> 1310.0
or do you mean you buy up stuff

1316.84 --> 1319.84
cheaply

1322.0 --> 1329.28
dumpster diving okay all right

1325.2 --> 1332.24
wow that that's pretty astounding that

1329.28 --> 1347.84
you just find silver in there

1332.24 --> 1347.84
that's just crazy

1389.12 --> 1391.4399999999998
huh

1392.96 --> 1403.8400000000001
okay dac i didn't know that he was doing

1395.28 --> 1403.84
that sort of thing

1406.64 --> 1417.8400000000001
right that's it yeah that makes sense

1428.84 --> 1431.84
so

1456.84 --> 1459.84
hmm

1468.159 --> 1474.96
right well random explorer

1471.52 --> 1478.0
like i do pay attention if i see

1474.96 --> 1482.159
like stuff piled on in a

1478.0 --> 1485.36
uh in a container for a disposal

1482.159 --> 1486.4
i do like put take a look and just size

1485.36 --> 1489.52
up like hey

1486.4 --> 1492.48
what what type of stuff is this

1489.52 --> 1494.0
and sometimes interesting things can be

1492.48 --> 1497.1200000000001
in there

1494.0 --> 1500.96
i've never really seen

1497.12 --> 1503.1999999999998
like i don't know jewelry or whatever or

1500.96 --> 1504.799
cabinets in which or boxes in which

1503.2 --> 1509.6000000000001
jewelry i've never

1504.799 --> 1512.84
but yeah then again those are

1509.6 --> 1515.52
probably to be found in in more remote

1512.84 --> 1516.08
locations like in old people that have

1515.52 --> 1517.9189999999999
died

1516.08 --> 1521.6
their houses which are not going to be

1517.919 --> 1521.6000000000001
in the middle of the city and stuff

1522.4 --> 1529.8400000000001
but yeah whatever hey

1525.44 --> 1529.8400000000001
sleeping warrior good to see you

1535.36 --> 1543.84
yeah the downward bias

1561.36 --> 1565.279
magnet fishing huh

1566.0 --> 1570.799
right oh here in the city they seem to

1568.799 --> 1572.6399999999999
do that a lot of the time

1570.799 --> 1574.0
because sometimes when they go for

1572.64 --> 1576.88
groceries and

1574.0 --> 1578.88
take the route past the river do you see

1576.88 --> 1581.5200000000002
all kinds of scrap metal

1578.88 --> 1583.3600000000001
obviously heavily rusted and all having

1581.52 --> 1584.1589999999999
been dumped like on the side of the road

1583.36 --> 1587.52
that

1584.159 --> 1589.279
yeah that they've obviously fished that

1587.52 --> 1591.279
out

1589.279 --> 1599.84
so there's a lot of magnet fishing going

1591.279 --> 1599.84
on here in this city

1611.2 --> 1613.8400000000001
oh dear

1614.88 --> 1617.999
[Music]

1629.919 --> 1641.8400000000001
oh great

1704.24 --> 1708.159
yeah just don't do that

1708.559 --> 1712.559
i don't know who's doing that it's just

1722.84 --> 1725.84
don't

1728.0 --> 1739.84
wait i'm not mute anymore right

1835.84 --> 1837.9189999999999
you

1890.84 --> 1899.519
hmm okay batman forever forever

1895.279 --> 1899.519
you're very much into that i guess

1899.6 --> 1907.84
digging around in in old battlefields

1912.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
we have the time for that sort of thing

1941.519 --> 1946.08
i can imagine that especially with world

1944.96 --> 1949.1200000000001
war one

1946.08 --> 1951.12
with all the trenches that

1949.12 --> 1953.4399999999998
in the regions where those front lines

1951.12 --> 1956.559
were a lot that you'll probably find

1953.44 --> 1958.64
a lot of stuff in the ground over there

1956.559 --> 1959.76
because yeah they dug all these trenches

1958.64 --> 1962.5590000000002
and of course later

1959.76 --> 1965.36
they were all just filled up again so

1962.559 --> 1970.0
there's bound to be just

1965.36 --> 1974.32
equipment and things all over that place

1970.0 --> 1976.559
i mean they're probably gonna pick

1974.32 --> 1977.6
pick them up take them out before they

1976.559 --> 1979.519
pile it on but

1977.6 --> 1981.84
they're bound to forget a whole bunch of

1979.519 --> 1981.84
things

1982.559 --> 1987.2
and world war ii i don't know so much

1984.64 --> 1987.2
it's different

1988.24 --> 1994.559
it was not a trench war so then

1991.44 --> 1997.3600000000001
things relatively stay on the surface

1994.559 --> 2004.399
and they'll also be picked up quicker

1997.36 --> 2006.9599999999998
detected quicker

2004.399 --> 2006.9599999999998
anyways

2008.0 --> 2019.84
all right

2030.84 --> 2033.84
so

2044.84 --> 2047.84
hmm

2053.04 --> 2061.839
and then

2072.839 --> 2075.839
ugh

2084.639 --> 2089.839
hold on

2100.839 --> 2103.839
so

2128.839 --> 2131.839
so

2145.599 --> 2149.3590000000004
right so guys

2150.0 --> 2156.16
what would you like to talk about what

2153.04 --> 2159.2799999999997
would you like me to talk about

2156.16 --> 2162.0
except your personal hobbies that i

2159.28 --> 2164.7200000000003
probably don't know anything about or

2162.0 --> 2164.72
very little

2164.8 --> 2173.8390000000004
uh i could of course

2168.56 --> 2178.0789999999997
just go with tony's

2173.839 --> 2178.0789999999997
who's still very much on the

2178.72 --> 2189.68
the downward bias exposure tour

2184.56 --> 2189.68
for a while i'm not so obsessed with it

2190.32 --> 2194.8
but i do understand that this is not a

2193.28 --> 2198.0
thing that's going to go away

2194.8 --> 2201.2000000000003
easily because there's just

2198.0 --> 2204.32
a lot of people that hang on to it

2201.2 --> 2206.96
for kind of unforeseen reasons it's

2204.32 --> 2209.2000000000003
it doesn't really make any sense

2206.96 --> 2215.839
especially if you're a flat earther to

2209.2 --> 2215.839
hang on to that

2216.4 --> 2229.839
but yeah it's happening nonetheless

2232.079 --> 2238.0
all right well why tony because they're

2235.52 --> 2238.0
people

2239.359 --> 2245.2
you know all flat earthers or at least

2242.56 --> 2246.56
the vast majority of them used to be

2245.2 --> 2249.52
ballers

2246.56 --> 2252.4
just like that so yeah people hang on to

2249.52 --> 2252.4
old ideas

2252.48 --> 2256.0
even when they face that yeah those

2255.44 --> 2258.64
ideas

2256.0 --> 2260.48
are old and outdated they may just still

2258.64 --> 2263.2799999999997
hang on to them

2260.48 --> 2266.079
for personal reasons because they don't

2263.28 --> 2266.079
want to let go

2266.32 --> 2271.839
it's a human condition

2283.839 --> 2285.92
you

2318.24 --> 2324.9599999999996
ah right aaron brown

2321.44 --> 2324.96
yeah yeah geocentrism

2325.2 --> 2330.0789999999997
centrum is very close to like

2330.32 --> 2334.0
basically flat earth except a ball that

2333.28 --> 2336.96
that's

2334.0 --> 2336.96
the setup for that

2338.56 --> 2345.52
so i think that for example kent hovind

2342.0 --> 2347.839
is like a geocentrist like he believes

2345.52 --> 2350.32
there's a ball but he does

2347.839 --> 2352.24
the same time hang on to the bible in

2350.32 --> 2353.92
ways so he does think it's a container

2352.24 --> 2355.7599999999998
but there might be space out there it's

2353.92 --> 2357.28
kind of weird when he starts to address

2355.76 --> 2360.32
that part

2357.28 --> 2363.52
but i think that overall he is kind of

2360.32 --> 2363.52
like a geocentrist

2363.839 --> 2369.839
a ball earth geocentrist

2395.76 --> 2397.8390000000004
you

2436.4 --> 2440.96
all right doesn't seem like people are

2438.96 --> 2444.64
very talkative today

2440.96 --> 2444.64
that by the way includes myself

2446.319 --> 2450.64
still trying to like kind of let sink

2449.119 --> 2451.2000000000003
everything that just happened i think

2450.64 --> 2453.359
that

2451.2 --> 2457.04
when those police came by like there was

2453.359 --> 2457.04
just this energy shift happening

2457.359 --> 2462.24
in the middle of me just kind of like

2459.92 --> 2466.0
starting up my day and just

2462.24 --> 2469.1189999999997
not really suspecting anything

2466.0 --> 2472.319
this i don't know what happened well i

2469.119 --> 2474.079
kind of do know what happened but yes

2472.319 --> 2480.319
not really anything to do with me in

2474.079 --> 2482.6400000000003
this case

2480.319 --> 2484.4
because i'm just i'm having a very calm

2482.64 --> 2487.44
day

2484.4 --> 2495.839
so far at least when it

2487.44 --> 2495.839
concerns my own mood

2497.119 --> 2500.8
and yeah as i said there are some

2499.52 --> 2502.72
articles out there

2500.8 --> 2504.1600000000003
that have basically given me given a

2502.72 --> 2506.319
sign

2504.16 --> 2507.52
that yeah there may be some positive

2506.319 --> 2510.72
developments

2507.52 --> 2514.48
like say yeah the police

2510.72 --> 2516.3999999999996
in the netherlands finally grouping up

2514.48 --> 2517.839
against this crazy situation from the

2516.4 --> 2519.839
government that

2517.839 --> 2520.96
that made me very happy to bump into

2519.839 --> 2523.839
that

2520.96 --> 2523.839
and also that

2524.88 --> 2530.6400000000003
that there's being uh

2528.0 --> 2533.359
moves being made on a serious scale

2530.64 --> 2535.1189999999997
against mandatory vaccination

2533.359 --> 2536.88
and the countries that are trying to

2535.119 --> 2540.4
apply that

2536.88 --> 2542.319
makes me very relieved which should not

2540.4 --> 2544.88
be a surprise to anyone if they

2542.319 --> 2544.88
follow me

2547.2 --> 2552.56
so i'm kind of calm about it right now

2549.44 --> 2552.56
it's like okay well

2552.72 --> 2565.839
at least there's a movement there

2582.4 --> 2587.359
oh god well tony look why why does he do

2586.16 --> 2591.44
it

2587.359 --> 2593.92
i because

2591.44 --> 2596.7200000000003
he just wants his dielectric

2593.92 --> 2596.7200000000003
acceleration

2597.92 --> 2601.28
he wants that to be the thing maybe

2600.48 --> 2605.119
because

2601.28 --> 2608.48
he he picked that up and

2605.119 --> 2610.96
was hanging on to it very early

2608.48 --> 2612.0
and i don't that might just be the

2610.96 --> 2614.2400000000002
reason

2612.0 --> 2615.92
or maybe it's just become personal and

2614.24 --> 2620.24
it's because we

2615.92 --> 2622.4
the flat earth debate have rejected it

2620.24 --> 2623.2799999999997
that he's kind of being really stubborn

2622.4 --> 2628.96
and just saying

2623.28 --> 2628.96
like no mine is the right one

2629.119 --> 2636.1600000000003
and kind of almost like turning it into

2632.0 --> 2636.16
a political election almost

2638.0 --> 2642.319
spreading the word about this concept

2642.64 --> 2647.1189999999997
to try and convince as many people as

2644.64 --> 2651.2
possible

2647.119 --> 2651.2000000000003
and maybe that's how he perceives us

2656.319 --> 2663.839
i don't know

2669.92 --> 2674.079
all right and by the way to say it

2672.0 --> 2675.44
doesn't matter to us if we have gravity

2674.079 --> 2679.119
or not

2675.44 --> 2682.4
yeah that coming out of you no

2679.119 --> 2685.04
no tony it does matter to you

2682.4 --> 2685.76
because you're always always talking

2685.04 --> 2687.839
about it

2685.76 --> 2690.4
you're hyped up about it it does matter

2687.839 --> 2692.4
to you you don't like gravity you want

2690.4 --> 2696.88
it to go away and you want

2692.4 --> 2699.44
relative density to just be what it is

2696.88 --> 2700.079
and be enough which it is by the way i'm

2699.44 --> 2703.599
with you

2700.079 --> 2704.319
on that but you want it a lot so don't

2703.599 --> 2708.7200000000003
tell me

2704.319 --> 2708.72
it doesn't matter to you because it does

2709.04 --> 2719.839
let's just be honest about that tony

2736.24 --> 2747.839
okay wow

2770.56 --> 2775.839
yeah hello by the way indeed chris berry

2773.119 --> 2775.839
welcome to the

2786.839 --> 2789.839
chat

2807.71 --> 2810.78
[Music]

2851.839 --> 2855.2799999999997
anyway you guys will have noticed i'm

2853.76 --> 2857.5200000000004
not very rambly

2855.28 --> 2858.8
today especially compared to yesterday

2857.52 --> 2862.079
and the day before

2858.8 --> 2864.2400000000002
so today it's just not a uh i'm not

2862.079 --> 2868.559
super talkative

2864.24 --> 2868.5589999999997
although yeah i did bring out some

2870.839 --> 2873.7599999999998
reports

2872.079 --> 2877.3590000000004
maybe it's not me that's not that

2873.76 --> 2877.3590000000004
talkative maybe you guys

2880.72 --> 2884.9599999999996
yeah and and i don't want to just spend

2882.88 --> 2886.48
an hour just talking about bob

2884.96 --> 2889.44
all the time there's already enough

2886.48 --> 2889.44
people doing that

2891.119 --> 2901.839
every time you do that it's basically

2892.96 --> 2901.839
just advertising anyway

2920.8 --> 2925.44
oh yeah yeah yes then brandon toys i

2923.359 --> 2927.44
could talk about that for a few

2925.44 --> 2928.8
was kind of interesting because the

2927.44 --> 2933.359
entire show it seemed

2928.8 --> 2935.9700000000003
was mostly focused on addressing

2933.359 --> 2939.0299999999997
gradation in

2935.97 --> 2939.0299999999997
[Music]

2940.079 --> 2946.88
enclosed systems like with gas

2943.599 --> 2948.8
and how does that work and like tests

2946.88 --> 2951.04
were being figured out

2948.8 --> 2953.28
like oh if you have a vacuum chamber and

2951.04 --> 2955.599
you release a bit of gas in it

2953.28 --> 2957.28
and you just let it settle is it go is

2955.599 --> 2957.599
there going to be a slight gradient or

2957.28 --> 2960.96
not

2957.599 --> 2963.44
through sonic testing

2960.96 --> 2965.28
that was what the guy bringing it up

2963.44 --> 2967.599
suggested

2965.28 --> 2969.6800000000003
and then i had like follow-up ideas like

2967.599 --> 2972.7200000000003
okay so what if

2969.68 --> 2973.52
one side of the container you have a

2972.72 --> 2975.04
cold element

2973.52 --> 2976.72
and on the other side you have a heat

2975.04 --> 2980.24
element

2976.72 --> 2983.359
now is that going to form a persistent

2980.24 --> 2989.2799999999997
stable gradient because that could

2983.359 --> 2992.48
then get yeah get us halfway closer to

2989.28 --> 2994.1600000000003
trying to emulate the dynamic system of

2992.48 --> 2996.079
this world because maybe that is the

2994.16 --> 2998.24
case maybe that is

2996.079 --> 3000.079
what is really going on the heat is

2998.24 --> 3001.9199999999996
introduced at ground level we already

3000.079 --> 3004.1600000000003
kind of know this for sure

3001.92 --> 3005.2000000000003
but there might be a like a cold element

3004.16 --> 3008.72
up there as well

3005.2 --> 3009.7599999999998
and maybe this is a big part of what is

3008.72 --> 3013.839
responsible

3009.76 --> 3013.8390000000004
for the actual pressure gradation

3013.92 --> 3016.96
in a passive form

3017.44 --> 3021.28
right on top of it being a dynamic

3019.839 --> 3023.2
system and they're just being

3021.28 --> 3024.8
pressure differences and winds and all

3023.2 --> 3027.04
that

3024.8 --> 3029.52
so it was kind of interesting to think

3027.04 --> 3029.52
about that

3034.16 --> 3039.44
and then even technically you could see

3037.44 --> 3042.8
how much influence it makes so if you

3039.44 --> 3046.079
have like this closed box container

3042.8 --> 3047.3590000000004
then maybe the like it doesn't even

3046.079 --> 3050.6400000000003
matter how

3047.359 --> 3052.72
how the heat and cold elements

3050.64 --> 3054.16
how they're orientated whether it's up

3052.72 --> 3057.2
or down

3054.16 --> 3059.2
or sideways that the gradient

3057.2 --> 3060.3999999999996
that there would be a gradient formation

3059.2 --> 3069.839
within

3060.4 --> 3072.4
purely dependent on these elements

3069.839 --> 3074.96
i just yeah i just started thinking

3072.4 --> 3074.96
about that

3075.92 --> 3079.2000000000003
like maybe the gradient isn't even the

3078.64 --> 3081.2799999999997
gas

3079.2 --> 3083.2799999999997
gradient as it were isn't even because

3081.28 --> 3085.28
of relative density maybe it is just

3083.28 --> 3086.48
purely because of these heat and cold

3085.28 --> 3090.0
elements that might

3086.48 --> 3092.8
be present here that they are

3090.0 --> 3093.359
actually the more direct cause for the

3092.8 --> 3096.8
gas

3093.359 --> 3098.319
gradient within the realm

3096.8 --> 3101.6800000000003
so though i would thought that was kind

3098.319 --> 3101.68
of interesting to consider

3103.359 --> 3107.2
yeah and who knows maybe people are

3104.96 --> 3108.4
gonna test this like on camera as

3107.2 --> 3110.48
showing their

3108.4 --> 3112.48
vacuum chambers with heat elements

3110.48 --> 3114.2400000000002
called elements and the sonic test

3112.48 --> 3116.64
i would be kind of interested to see

3114.24 --> 3118.72
that if somebody

3116.64 --> 3121.5989999999997
would actually get to building that

3118.72 --> 3123.1189999999997
setup and then demonstrating it

3121.599 --> 3125.839
so who knows what's going to come

3123.119 --> 3125.839
rolling out of this

3126.96 --> 3143.52
but i'll be looking out for that

3139.599 --> 3143.52
yeah crispy look dude

3148.24 --> 3154.72
i mean come on the guy literally said

3152.64 --> 3158.64
that gas go down go boom boom he

3154.72 --> 3158.64
literally unironically said it

3159.44 --> 3167.839
so yeah he's been saying a lot of very

3162.96 --> 3167.839
weird things like that

3206.839 --> 3209.839
uh

3212.88 --> 3215.2000000000003
hmm

3216.319 --> 3220.48
right yeah george sanford so you're kind

3218.48 --> 3223.599
of getting it

3220.48 --> 3227.44
the idea that maybe the gas gradient has

3223.599 --> 3230.8
more direct relation to any

3227.44 --> 3237.839
coal and heat elements than it does to

3230.8 --> 3237.8390000000004
relative density

3239.839 --> 3244.16
and the yeah this is testable

3247.2 --> 3255.4399999999996
so yeah who knows

3251.599 --> 3258.0
might have just stumbled onto

3255.44 --> 3258.88
well the cause of the gas pressure

3258.0 --> 3262.96
gradient

3258.88 --> 3265.6800000000003
the more direct cause instead of just

3262.96 --> 3269.76
presuming that that relative density

3265.68 --> 3269.7599999999998
would have some kind of influence on it

3273.2 --> 3280.5589999999997
as it would do with all non gases and

3276.839 --> 3281.599
yeah like in the open it because it's

3280.559 --> 3285.2000000000003
difficult you know gas

3281.599 --> 3288.0
expands in all directions always

3285.2 --> 3288.64
but yeah when it settles what happens

3288.0 --> 3290.72
then

3288.64 --> 3293.359
does it naturally gradiate even without

3290.72 --> 3296.3999999999996
temperature differences

3293.359 --> 3300.0
on sides or is it really the temperature

3296.4 --> 3303.2000000000003
differences on sides that is going to

3300.0 --> 3306.64
make it form a pressure gradient

3303.2 --> 3307.2
right because every time we demonstrate

3306.64 --> 3309.68
it

3307.2 --> 3311.2799999999997
without the cold elements like in a

3309.68 --> 3312.8799999999997
limited chamber

3311.28 --> 3315.8390000000004
there doesn't seem to be much of a

3312.88 --> 3319.76
gradient forming over time

3315.839 --> 3321.68
yet out here there is a gradient so

3319.76 --> 3323.599
yeah maybe it is just that maybe it is

3321.68 --> 3326.0
the heat and cold elements

3323.599 --> 3328.7200000000003
that are actually the more direct cause

3326.0 --> 3328.72
of the gradient

3328.88 --> 3332.799
of the gas that is settled within the

3332.839 --> 3335.839
container

3337.04 --> 3344.72
ugh yeah batman forever

3342.079 --> 3345.44
yeah he likes the gravimeter a lot

3344.72 --> 3349.2799999999997
because

3345.44 --> 3350.7200000000003
according to him it's direct proof of

3349.28 --> 3354.4
the

3350.72 --> 3354.3999999999996
downward acceleration

3355.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
it's yeah

3374.839 --> 3377.839
hmm

3388.839 --> 3391.839
um

3402.839 --> 3405.839
huh

3463.28 --> 3467.44
uh welcome back i'm andy young uh not

3466.4 --> 3470.319
much you didn't

3467.44 --> 3470.96
miss too much i've addressed i talked a

3470.319 --> 3472.96
little about

3470.96 --> 3475.839
what the subject we talked about over at

3472.96 --> 3475.839
run toys yesterday

3476.48 --> 3483.52
about the idea that maybe

3480.079 --> 3485.8390000000004
it's heat and cooling elements

3483.52 --> 3489.839
that might be the direct cause of the

3485.839 --> 3489.839
the gas pressure gradation

3490.24 --> 3495.7599999999998
and that's testable or at least testable

3493.76 --> 3498.96
whether that could be the possibility we

3495.76 --> 3501.6800000000003
can't really very manipulate

3498.96 --> 3502.64
the heat and cold elements that are part

3501.68 --> 3505.359
of this earth

3502.64 --> 3507.2
it's a little bit much can't really

3505.359 --> 3512.16
isolate it

3507.2 --> 3512.16
but we could emulate it in a smaller

3514.839 --> 3517.839
setup

3528.839 --> 3531.839
hmm

3542.839 --> 3545.839
okay

3556.839 --> 3559.839
hmm

3570.839 --> 3573.839
hmm

3584.839 --> 3587.839
um

3638.24 --> 3643.839
come on guys

3644.48 --> 3648.559
we still got another hour to go

3653.04 --> 3657.839
is everybody just in a mood like this

3655.119 --> 3657.839
just

3664.799 --> 3671.839
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

3696.839 --> 3713.839
hmm

3699.599 --> 3713.839
i'll be back in two minutes

3801.28 --> 3804.799
all right i'm back

3806.079 --> 3812.799
is chocolate going to the big meet up

3809.119 --> 3814.88
what what big meet up i don't know about

3812.799 --> 3825.839
is there some big meetup going on in the

3814.88 --> 3825.839
united states

3836.839 --> 3839.839
what

3850.839 --> 3853.839
um

3864.839 --> 3869.2
hmm

3866.319 --> 3872.5589999999997
all right yeah my show today is just not

3869.2 --> 3872.5589999999997
not super compacted

3873.2 --> 3877.0389999999998
i've just had a strange way of starting

3876.4 --> 3879.039
the day

3877.039 --> 3882.7990000000004
and i'm kind of like out of my element

3879.039 --> 3882.7990000000004
so i'm not so fluid right now

3888.319 --> 3890.799
okay

3892.72 --> 3897.2799999999997
south khaki lack never heard of that

3906.839 --> 3909.839
hmm

3927.599 --> 3930.6400000000003
south carolina

3931.039 --> 3935.2000000000003
i don't know how you get got to the word

3933.28 --> 3937.8390000000004
khaki lag then

3935.2 --> 3937.839
that's weird

3962.839 --> 3965.839
hmm

3970.72 --> 3979.839
welcome back dutch sailor

3990.839 --> 3993.839
hmm

4032.839 --> 4035.839
hmm

4047.839 --> 4051.68
yeah a sleeping worry did you by the way

4050.559 --> 4056.7200000000003
pick up on

4051.68 --> 4056.72
my activity yesterday at brandon toys

4057.44 --> 4061.52
because there was some interesting talk

4059.52 --> 4064.88
then

4061.52 --> 4068.72
about testing gas pressure gradients

4064.88 --> 4072.319
and all that i yeah i elaborated

4068.72 --> 4077.839
on it a little here but it was really

4072.319 --> 4077.839
interesting like an interesting test

4078.24 --> 4081.52
that was being discussed so i thought

4080.24 --> 4091.0389999999998
you might be interested

4081.52 --> 4093.68
in that

4091.039 --> 4096.16
instead of talking about downward biases

4093.68 --> 4096.16
and all that

4102.839 --> 4105.839
no

4116.839 --> 4119.839
hmm

4172.839 --> 4175.839
so

4204.719 --> 4210.96
right so yeah i'm being unusually silent

4209.36 --> 4213.759999999999
here

4210.96 --> 4214.4800000000005
it's just i i can't really find a spring

4213.76 --> 4218.320000000001
to flow

4214.48 --> 4220.879999999999
forth from right now i'm just kind of

4218.32 --> 4222.239
like in a situation where i feel a

4220.88 --> 4224.2390000000005
little pressured from different

4222.239 --> 4226.159
directions and yeah when that happens

4224.239 --> 4231.839999999999
it's just

4226.159 --> 4231.839999999999
it's not a lot coming out right now

4242.96 --> 4248.96
and to be fair i'm not getting a lot of

4245.6 --> 4248.96
input from chad either

4251.199 --> 4254.719
but i'm not gonna blame you

4255.04 --> 4258.56
it's not there it's not there so it's

4258.08 --> 4260.88
not

4258.56 --> 4263.52
there from either sides then yeah that's

4260.88 --> 4266.400000000001
going to be a silent arwin

4263.52 --> 4266.400000000001
a lot of the stream

4271.44 --> 4287.839999999999
and he cures for trigger finger what

4275.28 --> 4287.84
i don't what

4288.8 --> 4292.4800000000005
is that like a medical condition i don't

4291.44 --> 4295.199
know what that is

4292.48 --> 4295.199
tom parker

4297.04 --> 4303.679
your finger locks up okay

4300.4 --> 4305.92
well at the knuckle

4303.679 --> 4305.92
hmm

4306.8 --> 4309.84
that's a tough one

4312.84 --> 4318.88
uh

4315.28 --> 4318.88
are you drinking a lot of coffee

4320.719 --> 4327.28
because every time i have like

4324.159 --> 4329.44
joint or muscle issues

4327.28 --> 4332.4
it usually turns out that i just drank a

4329.44 --> 4334.719
little bit too much coffee

4332.4 --> 4337.5199999999995
because it does tend to do that give me

4334.719 --> 4342.4
more cramps and

4337.52 --> 4345.76
yeah just sore muscles that won't relax

4342.4 --> 4345.759999999999
okay not really

4345.84 --> 4349.6
right well okay

4352.4 --> 4357.839999999999
are you taking any tumeric

4359.92 --> 4371.84
water lacking of potassium that could

4363.199 --> 4371.839999999999
help too

4372.64 --> 4375.04
you do

4382.84 --> 4385.84
huh

4390.08 --> 4395.04
okay well i don't know

4396.84 --> 4400.88
maybe

4398.88 --> 4403.6
have a good yeah i don't know it's just

4400.88 --> 4407.76
an idea maybe have a good massage

4403.6 --> 4411.4400000000005
on yeah the area where it is

4407.76 --> 4414.56
typically getting cramped now i do

4411.44 --> 4418.4
massages on myself i'm pretty good at it

4414.56 --> 4418.400000000001
i can also do it on other people too

4418.64 --> 4421.84
but for example in recent days i've been

4421.12 --> 4425.12
having like

4421.84 --> 4428.159000000001
issues with my shoulder a little

4425.12 --> 4429.44
it just keeps coming back and then i do

4428.159 --> 4432.5599999999995
my own thing

4429.44 --> 4435.919999999999
i don't just touch it or anything i

4432.56 --> 4440.56
really do trade it

4435.92 --> 4444.32
on the spot and that works

4440.56 --> 4444.320000000001
oh okay you're already doing that well

4445.76 --> 4448.88
then i don't really know what what else

4447.92 --> 4451.1990000000005
you could do

4448.88 --> 4451.1990000000005
maybe

4453.52 --> 4461.52
uh stimulate blood flow

4457.44 --> 4464.719
maybe some red pepper or something

4461.52 --> 4467.679
applying it topically so

4464.719 --> 4468.32
to stimulate the uh the blood going

4467.679 --> 4471.84
through

4468.32 --> 4475.28
that might be another option you know

4471.84 --> 4478.400000000001
but seems you're already doing so much

4475.28 --> 4483.84
cbd cbd could help

4478.4 --> 4483.839999999999
could assist in regeneration process

4495.199 --> 4497.839999999999
what

4500.4 --> 4503.839999999999
a person that complains about her finger

4503.36 --> 4507.759999999999
by

4503.84 --> 4510.64
itself what does that mean

4507.76 --> 4511.6
what well i don't know what does that

4510.64 --> 4513.92
mean

4511.6 --> 4525.84
this is i don't know what that means i

4513.92 --> 4525.84
was gonna ask you

4530.239 --> 4534.718999999999
i know my family into music production

4535.44 --> 4542.32
well not so much anymore

4539.28 --> 4545.679
my mother used to be a composer

4542.32 --> 4548.719
and doing a lot in that studio

4545.679 --> 4551.52
stuff with her school

4548.719 --> 4554.08
and but my dad just was a guitar teacher

4551.52 --> 4556.4800000000005
and he kind of gave up on it because of

4554.08 --> 4558.0
well because of just issues he had with

4556.48 --> 4561.839999999999
his fingers doing it

4558.0 --> 4563.44
for so long so there's not

4561.84 --> 4566.0
there's currently not a lot of music

4563.44 --> 4569.12
production going on in my family

4566.0 --> 4569.12
but there used to be

4575.199 --> 4578.839999999999
i would like to know more about

4576.48 --> 4583.04
composition and process of writing music

4578.84 --> 4587.1990000000005
well poof i

4583.04 --> 4590.239
don't ask me i i don't know

4587.199 --> 4592.08
i don't know anything about that it's

4590.239 --> 4593.5199999999995
nothing i find more difficult than

4592.08 --> 4598.4
trying to create music

4593.52 --> 4599.4400000000005
seriously i pick up on music i know kind

4598.4 --> 4602.48
of how to

4599.44 --> 4606.5599999999995
copy it parrot it sing it or

4602.48 --> 4608.0
flute whatever but like composing my own

4606.56 --> 4611.360000000001
stuff

4608.0 --> 4615.84
no i've never done that really

4611.36 --> 4615.839999999999
it's too difficult what's this

4620.719 --> 4624.32
okay the weird glitch there

4626.239 --> 4629.04
in the background

4635.52 --> 4641.4400000000005
like what i could typically do is i can

4638.64 --> 4644.0
analyze music i can

4641.44 --> 4644.5599999999995
figure out all kinds of things about it

4644.0 --> 4647.84
but

4644.56 --> 4651.84
making it that's a whole different deal

4647.84 --> 4651.84
and i'm not good at that

4654.719 --> 4658.8
in a way it's almost like a mystery to

4656.56 --> 4665.84
me in how

4658.8 --> 4665.84
musicians even do that successfully

4673.36 --> 4683.04
her finger move by itself

4677.04 --> 4683.04
what so involuntary spasms

4683.84 --> 4693.84
that's weird

4700.48 --> 4721.839999999999
that sounds like a nerve control

4704.84 --> 4721.84
issue like misfiring

4722.4 --> 4728.4
i want to know how to learn what what's

4724.8 --> 4728.400000000001
in your head put it on paper

4733.12 --> 4736.239
well if you really want to try anything

4735.28 --> 4739.599999999999
like that i just

4736.239 --> 4742.32
use music programs on

4739.6 --> 4744.4800000000005
on a computer like a music writing

4742.32 --> 4745.92
program just something basic to start

4744.48 --> 4749.199
out with

4745.92 --> 4749.679
to just basically have a tune in your

4749.199 --> 4752.719
head

4749.679 --> 4753.36
and then try to match it with what

4752.719 --> 4756.0
you're gonna

4753.36 --> 4758.799999999999
put down and just let it play and then

4756.0 --> 4760.84
is that what you had in mind and if not

4758.8 --> 4762.08
what's the difference how do you get it

4760.84 --> 4777.84
right

4762.08 --> 4777.84
that's that's just training

4778.8 --> 4791.84
all right for me the thinking up part is

4781.52 --> 4791.84
the difficult one

4794.8 --> 4800.0
because yeah on paper yeah you could

4798.4 --> 4802.48
write it down

4800.0 --> 4804.32
but then you don't know for certain like

4802.48 --> 4806.08
if what you wrote down is actually

4804.32 --> 4808.96
correct

4806.08 --> 4810.0
and that's why a computer is so much

4808.96 --> 4812.159
handier because

4810.0 --> 4814.32
computers where you have like music

4812.159 --> 4816.839999999999
writing systems

4814.32 --> 4818.159
it's not that difficult to just make it

4816.84 --> 4820.32
play

4818.159 --> 4822.799999999999
so you can literally hear what it is you

4820.32 --> 4822.799999999999
wrote down

4826.0 --> 4829.6
like here if the tones and the rhythm

4828.239 --> 4831.919999999999
the timing if that

4829.6 --> 4847.84
is all correct according to what you

4831.92 --> 4847.84
hear in your head

4857.199 --> 4861.839999999999
you can't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow

4872.84 --> 4875.84
okay

4881.679 --> 4887.1990000000005
okay dank yeah i've heard about that

4887.44 --> 4893.28
that can happen so yeah don't play it

4891.36 --> 4894.639
over and over and over again unless

4893.28 --> 4898.0
you're satisfied this

4894.639 --> 4898.0
is what i heard in my head

4899.92 --> 4905.6
don't don't play it back too much it's

4902.32 --> 4905.599999999999
it's just for checking up

4905.84 --> 4912.4800000000005
like eventually when you

4909.44 --> 4912.799999999999
you basically get a good feel and skill

4912.48 --> 4915.199
for

4912.8 --> 4917.679
how to write down music you won't really

4915.199 --> 4920.159
even need

4917.679 --> 4920.719
to play things back a lot because you

4920.159 --> 4923.92
just

4920.719 --> 4925.44
know what the notes are what they're

4923.92 --> 4928.719
going to turn out to be

4925.44 --> 4932.638999999999
when you check it you know the

4928.719 --> 4935.12
the computer music studio setup is only

4932.639 --> 4937.679
i only forwarded that as a suggestion

4935.12 --> 4939.199
for training

4937.679 --> 4941.6
because indeed if you're just going to

4939.199 --> 4944.32
keep playing it back constantly yeah

4941.6 --> 4959.120000000001
that's going to influence what how you

4944.32 --> 4962.32
hear it in your head too

4959.12 --> 4964.159
all right it's kind of like a dream

4962.32 --> 4965.759999999999
you had a really intense dream very

4964.159 --> 4968.719
vivid

4965.76 --> 4969.92
it's like an interior meaning of it and

4968.719 --> 4973.44
then when you try to

4969.92 --> 4974.4800000000005
write it down solidify it then like the

4973.44 --> 4977.5199999999995
dream itself

4974.48 --> 4981.199
can change that happens

4977.52 --> 4986.080000000001
and that kind of happens with music too

4981.199 --> 4989.36
from what i've seen with other people

4986.08 --> 4991.84
because i only really just copy tunes in

4989.36 --> 4991.839999999999
my head

4994.96 --> 4998.719
or i don't know at best what i do

4997.679 --> 5001.28
creatively

4998.719 --> 5003.679
is i take some tune and then kind of

5001.28 --> 5005.759999999999
alter it a little take it out of whack

5003.679 --> 5006.88
and then see what that's like that's

5005.76 --> 5008.96
like

5006.88 --> 5009.92
that's something i sort of do sometimes

5008.96 --> 5012.96
when i in the

5009.92 --> 5016.08
in the mood for it

5012.96 --> 5018.56
but mostly it's just like good

5016.08 --> 5018.5599999999995
songs

5019.12 --> 5026.159
that i like those keep just repeating

5022.88 --> 5029.76
in my mind and i enjoy that and i can

5026.159 --> 5033.5199999999995
sing with it if i feel like it

5029.76 --> 5033.52
but making my own

5033.6 --> 5037.52
from scratch melody and all that that's

5036.48 --> 5040.638999999999
just something that

5037.52 --> 5057.84
i have no experience with that

5040.639 --> 5057.84
at all none

5061.36 --> 5063.599999999999
hmm

5064.639 --> 5071.84
hello julia pavin good to see you

people in the effie conference

5157.76 --> 5165.92
in amsterdam in 2019

5161.52 --> 5169.84

5201.28 --> 5207.04
forgetting the names

5202.88 --> 5210.4800000000005
but just yeah a whole bunch of people

5207.04 --> 5213.84
from that that group typically

5210.48 --> 5217.04
those people typically just go together

5213.84 --> 5217.04
to these meetups

5223.12 --> 5226.4
right if i'm forgetting your name i'm

5225.28 --> 5230.159
sorry

5226.4 --> 5230.159
i'm not really good with names

but yeah i met a whole bunch of people

5233.04 --> 5239.84
over there

5234.639 --> 5239.84
it was very interesting experience

5240.08 --> 5243.28
a little tense though i was quite tense

5242.56 --> 5245.6
then

5243.28 --> 5252.239
really nervous and i got really sick

5245.6 --> 5254.400000000001
afterwards but i predicted that

5252.239 --> 5257.28
in a way i was kind of scared to meet

5254.4 --> 5257.28
them in person

5260.32 --> 5266.719
to like move beyond

5263.36 --> 5269.04
internet level contact to real face to

5266.719 --> 5269.04
face

5269.52 --> 5276.0
that was that was kind yeah that was a

5272.4 --> 5276.0
bit scary for me at the time

5277.28 --> 5281.92
oh yeah and of course i met nathan

5278.96 --> 5284.4
oakley he came by to uh

5281.92 --> 5285.1990000000005
basically hand me ranty's camera and

5284.4 --> 5288.159
then he

5285.199 --> 5289.5199999999995

5288.159 --> 5293.28
of that

5289.52 --> 5296.0
during that conference on his show comes

5293.28 --> 5298.159
comes by it's a good photo i look pretty

5296.0 --> 5301.199
good on there so

5298.159 --> 5301.199
i do not mind

5306.32 --> 5309.84
who else was there

5313.92 --> 5316.96
oh yeah of course uh

5317.84 --> 5321.12
from the tour um

5321.44 --> 5325.839999999999
i'm just ridiculous okay i'm freaking it

5328.48 --> 5331.44
i feel terrible

5332.159 --> 5339.599999999999
hey roxanne of course roxanne

5336.48 --> 5343.04
hung around with her a little

5339.6 --> 5343.04
in that amazing van

5344.0 --> 5348.84
and jason then the disbury family that

5347.12 --> 5351.84
guy

5348.84 --> 5351.84
also

5356.8 --> 5363.1990000000005
and lisa part of that team as well

5360.08 --> 5365.28
oh yeah see i remember names wow

5363.199 --> 5368.5599999999995
i can't believe it i'm actually

5365.28 --> 5368.5599999999995
remembering all these names

5371.84 --> 5379.84
but yeah yeah that was a great time it

5374.88 --> 5379.84
was a really interesting experience

5380.639 --> 5393.76
also it's pretty much the last group

5384.08 --> 5395.44
gathering i've ever been to

5393.76 --> 5398.08
i haven't heard of patricia which

5395.44 --> 5398.08
patricia

5400.96 --> 5406.639
you mean patricia steer

5404.159 --> 5408.48
she's still around she did a stream not

5406.639 --> 5411.12
too long ago what is it like two weeks

5408.48 --> 5414.959999999999
ago or something

5411.12 --> 5414.96
she still does streams every now and

5418.84 --> 5421.84
then

5460.96 --> 5467.199
yeah dutch sailor yeah yeah she's well

5464.159 --> 5469.28
she deleted her old channel and then

5467.199 --> 5472.0
started a new one

5469.28 --> 5474.239
and a lot of those early streams of the

5472.0 --> 5477.44
new channel she spent on basically

5474.239 --> 5480.159
talking about that situation

5477.44 --> 5480.159
a lot of it

5484.48 --> 5491.5199999999995
i get the feeling that that time is now

5487.6 --> 5494.88
kind of behind her

5491.52 --> 5499.679
the involved person is not really

5494.88 --> 5499.679
making her life as miserable as he did

5502.84 --> 5505.84
before

5544.84 --> 5547.84
foreign

5558.84 --> 5561.84
so

5586.84 --> 5589.84
uh

5655.84 --> 5660.32
do i watch dr kaufman or dr tom cohen at

5659.6 --> 5663.76
all no

5660.32 --> 5667.04
not really i do have definitely heard of

5663.76 --> 5669.84
dr kaufman i've seen some of his videos

5667.04 --> 5671.44
since he's been an alarmist about the

5669.84 --> 5674.32
situation

5671.44 --> 5676.239
and also brought forth i think he was

5674.32 --> 5680.159
one of the ones that really

5676.239 --> 5682.48
brought forward to the scene the

5680.159 --> 5686.159
terrain theory as an alternative to

5682.48 --> 5688.159
virus theory

5686.159 --> 5690.32
to explain a whole bunch of things so he

5688.159 --> 5692.5599999999995
def yeah i remember him for that

5690.32 --> 5693.44
but i don't really follow his streams

5692.56 --> 5696.8
you know i'm not

5693.44 --> 5696.799999999999
subscribed to his channel

5697.36 --> 5703.36
but i do know him he's a pretty cool guy

5704.159 --> 5708.799999999999
and dr tom cohen i i never heard of him

5712.88 --> 5717.1990000000005
rumble orbit okay well that explains

5715.36 --> 5720.159
because i don't really

5717.199 --> 5720.159
do anything with that

5723.76 --> 5729.84
but yeah good to hear he's still active

5725.76 --> 5729.84
out there

5796.84 --> 5799.84
hey

5807.679 --> 5813.36
i wonder if it's going to be like this

5809.36 --> 5815.44
on the flat earth debate as well

5813.36 --> 5817.28
yesterday everybody couldn't stop

5815.44 --> 5820.638999999999
talking

5817.28 --> 5823.599999999999
and neither could i on my own show

5820.639 --> 5823.6
today it's just

5824.8 --> 5841.84
seems like there's like on the uh

5826.88 --> 5841.84
everything's on slow mode

5848.8 --> 5855.84
right you can't have a a

5852.159 --> 5855.839999999999
heavy show every day so

5857.6 --> 5862.159000000001
nathan is going to crush a lot of bad

5859.679 --> 5862.159
spirits

5866.84 --> 5871.679
maybe

5869.44 --> 5883.839999999999
i don't know if he has anything specific

5871.679 --> 5883.84
planned like that

5885.92 --> 5890.08
i bent them all over here

5890.639 --> 5900.159000000001
oh those bats yeah the trolls yeah

5897.199 --> 5903.199
yeah i'm not really feet yeah feeling

5900.159 --> 5903.199
feeling it today

5908.32 --> 5916.96
all right yeah i did bend them

5912.8 --> 5916.96
because they were just ruining my mood

5918.8 --> 5925.84
and i was kind of done with it

5937.679 --> 5942.32
okay well james ellen if you don't like

5939.76 --> 5942.320000000001
it then

5942.48 --> 5945.839999999999
yeah then don't watch it

5946.159 --> 5949.5199999999995
i think there's still plenty of

5947.6 --> 5953.84
interesting things coming by over at the

5949.52 --> 5953.84
flat earth debates

5992.239 --> 5996.718999999999
it's always useful to keep track of this

5994.239 --> 5996.718999999999
hangout

5997.52 --> 6009.84
you mean mine or flat earth debates

6021.52 --> 6025.4400000000005
hello eric one one one one

6033.92 --> 6037.119
all right that's it yeah thanks i do

6036.32 --> 6041.28
like to be

6037.119 --> 6044.08
kind of like a i grab

6041.28 --> 6045.84
hold of things that stood out to me from

6044.08 --> 6048.5599999999995
all over the scene

6045.84 --> 6050.0
whether it's like a flat earth scene or

6048.56 --> 6053.679
political scene

6050.0 --> 6057.84
or local

6053.679 --> 6060.96
things corona all that yeah i do

6057.84 --> 6065.76
typically like to basically pick out

6060.96 --> 6068.719
interesting things to then share them

6065.76 --> 6071.4400000000005
doesn't always guarantee a fluid hangout

6068.719 --> 6075.44
on my part though

6071.44 --> 6075.44
and today i don't know man it just

6076.0 --> 6079.84
it just feels like it's on mute

6080.56 --> 6083.4400000000005
it's not rolling

6084.32 --> 6089.119
this morning was just too weird for me

6086.8 --> 6092.4800000000005
it really kind of caught me off guard

6089.119 --> 6094.48
and now i feel like i'm like just

6092.48 --> 6096.959999999999
in need of some time to figure it all

6094.48 --> 6096.959999999999
out again

6099.76 --> 6103.679
but i'll be alright probably tomorrow

6101.6 --> 6107.84
will just be a typical show

6103.679 --> 6107.84
as it has been

6134.56 --> 6138.8
hey guns i've never run rmp good to see

6146.84 --> 6149.84
you

6157.44 --> 6164.638999999999
ah wow thank you very much that's

6160.48 --> 6164.638999999999
dutch said i really appreciate that

6166.4 --> 6169.92
but that that is kind of what i do like

6168.48 --> 6172.799999999999
to do

6169.92 --> 6173.28
point at details that i think a lot of

6172.8 --> 6176.88
people

6173.28 --> 6180.48
overlook just

6176.88 --> 6180.88
yeah it is typically what i like to do

6180.48 --> 6183.839999999999
even

6180.88 --> 6184.719
inside of a group that is active with

6183.84 --> 6188.0
subjects i

6184.719 --> 6192.8
it's just almost neurotic like i

6188.0 --> 6192.8
i i always like to do that

6197.28 --> 6202.48
like i've done that since i was a little

6199.119 --> 6204.719
kid it's like every time

6202.48 --> 6206.959999999999
it would almost be like my way to show

6204.719 --> 6209.28
off at first

6206.96 --> 6211.92
to kind of intellectually compete with

6209.28 --> 6215.5199999999995
people that were much more

6211.92 --> 6219.84
confident and had more

6215.52 --> 6223.280000000001
time to have figured things out

6219.84 --> 6225.52
but i could still do that is just

6223.28 --> 6227.679
take a look at the entire picture from a

6225.52 --> 6229.679
fourth dimensional perspective

6227.679 --> 6232.0
just like that and just point at

6229.679 --> 6234.2390000000005
something that

6232.0 --> 6236.159
stands out to me that i think most

6234.239 --> 6237.919999999999
people won't be focused on

6236.159 --> 6247.839999999999
because they'll be distracted by the

6237.92 --> 6247.84
typical elements of it

6258.08 --> 6264.719
right yeah and language clarity

6262.48 --> 6266.08
the communication is very important with

6264.719 --> 6267.679
that every time

6266.08 --> 6270.4
especially if you're going to point out

6267.679 --> 6272.96
something that is kind of

6270.4 --> 6274.08
typically overlooked then clarity is

6272.96 --> 6276.32
everything

6274.08 --> 6277.119
if you just mumble some detail people

6276.32 --> 6280.719
will be like

6277.119 --> 6283.28
what what and just forget about it

6280.719 --> 6285.44
so if i am gonna point out some detail

6283.28 --> 6288.639
then i'll try to make it as clear as i

6285.44 --> 6290.879999999999
possibly can

6288.639 --> 6292.159000000001
to make sure that people actually will

6290.88 --> 6295.28
have the ability

6292.159 --> 6297.599999999999
to focus on it and not just like

6295.28 --> 6299.04
uh this confuses me i'm gonna shove it

6297.6 --> 6302.2390000000005
aside

6299.04 --> 6317.84
right clarity is key

6302.239 --> 6317.839999999999
to being successful in that process

6321.04 --> 6331.84
all right

6336.88 --> 6344.639
what do i think teleported

6341.119 --> 6346.799999999999
that's a sci-fi question stevie traveler

6344.639 --> 6347.679
do i think teleportation will ever be

6346.8 --> 6349.360000000001
realized

6347.679 --> 6352.4800000000005
if looping can be understood and

6349.36 --> 6355.36
controlled no

6352.48 --> 6357.36
control you say what the loop of the

6355.36 --> 6359.44
realm

6357.36 --> 6360.639
we're we're supposedly able to control

6359.44 --> 6364.159
that

6360.639 --> 6365.1990000000005
right or even if if there were if that

6364.159 --> 6369.28
was the case

6365.199 --> 6369.28
which i can't imagine how

6370.0 --> 6373.6
like it's nothing like teleportation

6372.48 --> 6375.599999999999
it's basically

6373.6 --> 6377.76
in a completely different direction the

6375.6 --> 6379.76
concept of teleportation has nothing to

6377.76 --> 6383.6
do with loops

6379.76 --> 6384.159000000001
or even the sci-fi idea of wormholes and

6383.6 --> 6387.280000000001
all that

6384.159 --> 6391.92
it's a completely different category

6387.28 --> 6398.159
teleportation is conceived

6391.92 --> 6398.159
on the basis that you could completely

6398.84 --> 6405.52
analyze to the micro

6402.4 --> 6409.28
molecular level something

6405.52 --> 6409.280000000001
and then basically

6409.36 --> 6416.96
translate that into digital information

6413.679 --> 6420.32
send that to a device

6416.96 --> 6423.119
that can then create the exact replica

6420.32 --> 6425.759999999999
of what the digital representation

6423.119 --> 6427.839999999999
represents

6425.76 --> 6429.92
and that way you teleport that is

6427.84 --> 6432.2390000000005
literally the idea of teleportation and

6429.92 --> 6432.2390000000005
it is

6434.32 --> 6440.84
quite unviable it really is science

6438.48 --> 6443.839999999999
fiction

6440.84 --> 6443.84
and

6444.56 --> 6450.159000000001
no i don't think i don't think i'll

6447.76 --> 6452.08
ever see any hint of any of that being

6450.159 --> 6455.599999999999
real

6452.08 --> 6457.6
within my lifetime at least or ever

6455.6 --> 6458.8
i don't think it it'll ever be possible

6457.6 --> 6463.119000000001
or even like

6458.8 --> 6463.119000000001
worth it it's just never gonna be worth

6468.84 --> 6474.96
it

6471.44 --> 6478.48
but i don't know if creating

6474.96 --> 6480.0
micro wormholes if if such a thing is

6478.48 --> 6483.04
even possible beyond

6480.0 --> 6484.96
space theory and all that

6483.04 --> 6487.199
yeah maybe maybe there can be made

6484.96 --> 6491.52
shortcuts by bending

6487.199 --> 6492.32
spatiality i don't know maybe that is a

6491.52 --> 6495.280000000001
possibility

6492.32 --> 6497.28
that you could just with one step move a

6495.28 --> 6500.639
mile

6497.28 --> 6504.4
somehow through another

6500.639 --> 6507.679
another dimension as it were but

6504.4 --> 6509.599999999999
literally teleportation no no that's

6507.679 --> 6513.52
it really is just ridiculous when you

6509.6 --> 6516.400000000001
think about it

6513.52 --> 6520.080000000001
like why would you like there is no

6516.4 --> 6520.08
advantage of doing that

6521.679 --> 6530.08
compared to what you will need for it

6527.04 --> 6531.04
what create things out of thin air just

6530.08 --> 6534.159
reconstruct

6531.04 --> 6537.76
something based on information

6534.159 --> 6541.119
so yeah if that is

6537.76 --> 6544.08
possibility then

6541.119 --> 6546.08
like teleportation and that used as a

6544.08 --> 6547.44
mode of transportation is just going to

6546.08 --> 6551.679
be a side note

6547.44 --> 6553.598999999999
a total side note compared to

6551.679 --> 6556.88
the things that will be unleashed

6553.599 --> 6556.88
because of that potential

6557.92 --> 6569.84
this yeah

6579.52 --> 6587.119000000001
oh yeah harold

6583.28 --> 6587.119
good questions coming in the last 10

6594.84 --> 6597.84
minutes

6611.52 --> 6616.4800000000005
that's quite a weird question there

6613.76 --> 6616.4800000000005
dorian gray

6623.04 --> 6629.04
high speed underground trains right

6626.56 --> 6639.84
well i think that's actually an

6629.04 --> 6639.84
interesting idea

6640.8 --> 6643.92
steam traveler like underground

6642.4 --> 6648.48
high-speed trains

6643.92 --> 6648.4800000000005
yeah why not

6649.84 --> 6655.04
i don't know i i haven't exactly looked

6652.159 --> 6658.239
into what he has planned or how

6655.04 --> 6659.679
i think i saw some documentary about it

6658.239 --> 6663.598999999999
one time

6659.679 --> 6667.84
or something like that but

6663.599 --> 6667.84
on average yeah why not

6674.96 --> 6680.0
like wasn't he the one that uh that that

6677.679 --> 6682.88
created the idea of like the vacuum

6680.0 --> 6682.88
propelled train

6684.239 --> 6690.239
wasn't wasn't that his idea

6687.76 --> 6694.400000000001
was that what he was utilizing or is it

6690.239 --> 6697.5199999999995
just a general idea out there because

6694.4 --> 6700.799999999999
high speed train like transport

6697.52 --> 6701.599
has been on a lot of designers minds i

6700.8 --> 6704.96
think for

6701.599 --> 6709.84
for a couple of decades now

6704.96 --> 6709.84
so kinds of concepts coming by

6713.679 --> 6717.1990000000005
vacuum propelled okay

6718.159 --> 6723.839999999999
maglev right sure

6762.84 --> 6765.84
hmm

6768.88 --> 6772.400000000001
that have underground cities what guns

6771.76 --> 6779.84
under

6772.4 --> 6779.839999999999
like what

6783.52 --> 6787.679
i'm sure that if there were underground

6785.92 --> 6791.84
cities yet it would benefit

6787.679 --> 6794.56
that enormously to just state like it's

6791.84 --> 6794.56
already there

6795.119 --> 6797.679
i don't know

6798.32 --> 6802.0
anyway i am going to round out the show

6802.159 --> 6807.839999999999
next time come an hour earlier with

6804.4 --> 6807.839999999999
these types of questions

6808.32 --> 6814.639
all right just kidding okay

6811.44 --> 6815.28
all right so anyway thanks for coming

6814.639 --> 6817.4400000000005

one guy

6844.96 --> 6850.4
amanda young uh

6848.48 --> 6852.239
i'm going to join the flat earth debates

6850.4 --> 6854.0
which should start up any minute now

6852.239 --> 6856.5599999999995
and i will be back tomorrow flat earth

6854.0 --> 6860.159
early bird number 842

6856.56 --> 6861.76
on the wednesday edition so until the

6860.159 --> 6875.969999999999
next video

6861.76 --> 6888.72
keep it flat
