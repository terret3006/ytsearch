gray soup

101.22 --> 106.52
with rain here and there

103.38 --> 106.52
also in the night

107.159 --> 110.22
but yeah it was a beautiful day

108.84 --> 113.479
yesterday

110.22 --> 113.479
while it lasted

121.079 --> 128.64
it's still not it's still not cold or

123.96 --> 132.29999999999998
anything though so whatever's going on

128.64 --> 134.76
the temperature seems to have

132.3 --> 138.14000000000001
kind of stabilized

134.76 --> 138.14
to this mild level

141.9 --> 146.76000000000002
oh it's eight degrees Celsius now

144.78 --> 149.7
right

146.76 --> 151.79999999999998
but yeah it's not that cold

149.7 --> 153.83999999999997
it's not even cold enough for me to put

151.8 --> 157.08
my radiator on

153.84 --> 160.019
anyway low Bill Nye the science denier

157.08 --> 162.31900000000002
first in chat Crockett Kevlar good to

160.019 --> 162.31900000000002
see you

162.62 --> 169.20000000000002
it is Thursday the 3rd of February 2022

178.8 --> 181.58
whoa

187.44 --> 190.629
[Applause]

221.099 --> 225.17999999999998
right yeah I'm just reading something

222.9 --> 228.68
off Skype here

225.18 --> 228.68
message from Nathan

228.72 --> 234.78
apparently well he's having some jaw

231.84 --> 236.28
issues enough for him to be kind of

234.78 --> 239.28
worried and gone to the hospital

236.28 --> 239.28
apparently

240.36 --> 245.78
but yeah I've been having teeth issues

243.36 --> 245.78
myself

247.14 --> 253.64
so it's probably a contributor to some

249.9 --> 253.64000000000001
of my bad moods

253.799 --> 257.82
right because there's not really

255.54 --> 259.56
anything I can do about it it's just

257.82 --> 262.86
like last time

259.56 --> 264.78000000000003
now that time where that part of my

262.86 --> 267.0
tooth broke off and that's what is it

264.78 --> 269.52
now a year ago

267.0 --> 271.74
more I don't even remember but that's

269.52 --> 273.84
not really bothering me anymore but yeah

271.74 --> 276.12
the new one is on the other side

273.84 --> 278.82
and it is bothering me

276.12 --> 282.0
because that's kind of like the molar I

278.82 --> 284.09999999999997
used to well chew my food with since it

282.0 --> 286.32
was like the last spot in my mouth that

284.1 --> 288.36
was still just kind of

286.32 --> 290.34
don't have to think about what I'm doing

288.36 --> 292.199
there

290.34 --> 296.419
and that's been bothering me a great

292.199 --> 296.41900000000004
deal in the last week or more

296.699 --> 300.32
anyway hello Adam Price

304.32 --> 310.15999999999997
but apparently Nathan Nathan is having

306.96 --> 310.15999999999997
some issues too

311.46 --> 315.44
ouch

313.02 --> 315.44
right

318.0 --> 320.9
I'm not gonna

325.979 --> 332.09999999999997
I'll just keep that in confidence

330.24 --> 334.46000000000004
I don't know if Nathan's gonna come on

332.1 --> 334.46000000000004
live

334.979 --> 337.82
today though

339.78 --> 344.0
Oh my Jesus I had a price

360.66 --> 363.319
ah

365.4 --> 368.06
right

380.1 --> 386.16
right seems like Nathan had a

384.06 --> 388.44
oh damn

386.16 --> 390.47900000000004
yeah I had a little Calamity a little

388.44 --> 392.639
accident and that's why I went to the

390.479 --> 395.039
hospital but

392.639 --> 397.8
yeah I hope he recovers that sounds yeah

395.039 --> 399.9
it sounded like it it yeah it was pretty

397.8 --> 402.44
serious

399.9 --> 406.13899999999995
it's like a like a work floor accident

402.44 --> 410.78
something he was doing I don't know

406.139 --> 410.78000000000003
but yeah I hope you recover Nathan

421.62 --> 427.44
and price yeah yeah tooth pain

425.4 --> 429.539
yeah I've heard of more people that have

427.44 --> 431.4
done that and I've had a lot of

429.539 --> 434.759
toothache in my life too and that's why

431.4 --> 437.81899999999996
I let dentists just screw around with it

434.759 --> 441.08000000000004
in a time when I thought that oh so they

437.819 --> 441.08000000000004
only know how to do good

442.44 --> 445.039
all right

451.919 --> 456.35999999999996
but yeah I'm just trying to survive

454.5 --> 458.46
through whatever's going on here and I'm

456.36 --> 461.58000000000004
and I am

458.46 --> 463.919
sort of partially reluctantly relying on

461.58 --> 467.099
German new medicine

463.919 --> 469.79999999999995
besides just being confronted with a lot

467.099 --> 473.639
of toothache situations and

469.8 --> 477.0
not really grabbing for pain relief

473.639 --> 481.199
like externally for pharmacally

477.0 --> 484.56
has has kind of like well made me

481.199 --> 486.539
less distracted about it so I'm just

484.56 --> 488.4
yeah I might have a toothache it's just

486.539 --> 492.599
not really

488.4 --> 495.479
really that unbelievably terrible now

492.599 --> 498.78
but it's still kind of disturbing and it

495.479 --> 500.87899999999996
specially tends to get on on my mood

498.78 --> 503.75899999999996
and get more aggressive because of it

500.879 --> 507.06
it's kind of typical it's like toothache

503.759 --> 511.199
but it's not really like ah

507.06 --> 514.019
like that thank God not poof

511.199 --> 516.36
it's just a lot of nuisance all the time

514.019 --> 517.74
I'll survive through it I hope I'll need

516.36 --> 522.1800000000001
to

517.74 --> 523.86
cause I do not have funds even close to

522.18 --> 526.9399999999999
what I need to actually have something

523.86 --> 526.94
done about my teeth

528.66 --> 532.62
as long as I could just

530.519 --> 535.519
survive through it

532.62 --> 535.519
I'll be fine

535.74 --> 540.62
I hope

537.66 --> 540.62
anyway yeah

552.43 --> 558.5799999999999
[Applause]

575.04 --> 577.2199999999999
foreign

587.54 --> 591.66
also by the way why Nathan didn't show

590.399 --> 595.98
up

591.66 --> 598.14
on camera yesterday during the intro

595.98 --> 600.0
right because I guess he already had

598.14 --> 602.76
that accident

600.0 --> 605.22
he still did the show though

602.76 --> 607.9399999999999
so

605.22 --> 607.94
hmm

608.16 --> 612.12
I remember if tumeric was one of the

610.38 --> 616.76
best things for mouth pain

612.12 --> 616.76
hmm okay glad that worked for you

638.339 --> 644.399
George Sanford

640.38 --> 646.38
hello yeah open Oakley had an accident

644.399 --> 650.54
at home apparently

646.38 --> 650.54
I think it already happened two days ago

657.32 --> 661.1400000000001
but yeah he's not doing a live show

659.7 --> 663.98
today

661.14 --> 663.98
oh [ __ ]

670.51 --> 673.63
[Music]

676.38 --> 679.38
foreign

680.15 --> 683.37
[Applause]

697.24 --> 700.49
[Applause]

716.82 --> 722.639
right but anyway Nathan should be all

719.22 --> 724.62
right but he is yeah he did was pretty

722.639 --> 726.779
serious

724.62 --> 729.18
and apparently he still did like a live

726.779 --> 731.04
show with it yesterday without even

729.18 --> 733.8
mentioning it so

731.04 --> 736.74
right it's not like that freaking

733.8 --> 740.8389999999999
serious but it was like yeah

736.74 --> 740.839
still notable enough

743.519 --> 747.18
right but he's not doing a live show

745.62 --> 750.72
today

747.18 --> 752.399
unfortunately yes I was speedy recovery

750.72 --> 756.44
Nathan hope you get

752.399 --> 756.44
you know heal up quickly

762.3 --> 766.62
uh

764.36 --> 770.04
all right

766.62 --> 773.24
but yeah turmeric for mouth pain nah

770.04 --> 773.24
never really worked for me

776.399 --> 781.76
what did work for me again what did I

779.519 --> 781.76
use

788.639 --> 791.54
I don't remember

793.079 --> 795.92
hmm

803.78 --> 806.8199999999999
[Music]

814.62 --> 820.8
anyway yeah my knight

817.86 --> 823.139
that's pretty okay I had a late shower

820.8 --> 826.639
again that's why I'm

823.139 --> 826.639
loose haired and all that

826.74 --> 831.24
also I had

828.12 --> 832.5600000000001
a hot telephone call from my friend the

831.24 --> 836.1
name

832.56 --> 838.4399999999999
before the show is very unusual time and

836.1 --> 840.0600000000001
but I was already kind of getting ready

838.44 --> 842.519
for the show

840.06 --> 846.9799999999999
so I might have kind of overwhelmed her

842.519 --> 846.98
a little by just I explaining

848.76 --> 856.139
well what I've been doing recently

852.32 --> 858.899
and my attitude and all that

856.139 --> 861.32
because man I've been so pissed off even

858.899 --> 861.32
yesterday

864.66 --> 870.18
it's weird there's a consistency to it

867.24 --> 872.639
but every time afterward I'm like wow

870.18 --> 874.7399999999999
what is this

872.639 --> 879.139
doesn't even feel like it's me anymore

874.74 --> 879.139
but it is but it's still different

883.8 --> 890.4799999999999
ugh anyway I'm trying to

887.279 --> 890.48
keep it calm today

895.68 --> 900.899
okay yeah I don't know Adam I think it's

898.62 --> 902.339
on your side because I'm not having any

900.899 --> 904.8
issues

902.339 --> 908.0600000000001
well yesterday's show it at the

904.8 --> 908.06
beginning it had a weird

908.279 --> 913.26
leg again on my side but it doesn't

910.56 --> 915.18
happen that often anymore

913.26 --> 917.519
when it happened again yesterday where I

915.18 --> 919.8599999999999
constantly had to go back to the YouTube

917.519 --> 921.6
and then just keep clicking It Forward

919.86 --> 923.639
because it would constantly keep

921.6 --> 925.5
stalling but it was only at the

923.639 --> 927.9590000000001
beginning like the first

925.5 --> 929.88
five minutes then let's stop

927.959 --> 931.56
but yeah at the price you seem to be

929.88 --> 934.38
having that a lot

931.56 --> 938.42
I don't know why

934.38 --> 938.42
but it seems to be mostly you though

940.68 --> 943.2199999999999
right

945.42 --> 948.139
oh

971.459 --> 976.0189999999999
right and yeah Enterprise no we don't

973.86 --> 979.339
have satellite internet it's all cable

976.019 --> 979.339
everything it's all cable

988.139 --> 991.139
foreign

992.54 --> 995.8389999999999
good to see you

1031.699 --> 1038.14
right anyway a classical homeopath good

1035.36 --> 1038.1399999999999
to see you too

1038.36 --> 1043.6
it's not possible for anyone to have

1040.76 --> 1043.6
satellite internet

1048.86 --> 1054.32
well yeah man but maybe satellite

1051.14 --> 1056.419
internet is more for like radiographic

1054.32 --> 1059.0
non-cable based internet you know

1056.419 --> 1062.44
satellite is like this replacement word

1059.0 --> 1062.44
for a whole bunch of things

1062.48 --> 1065.14
so

1111.32 --> 1117.46
what's the difference between satellite

1113.78 --> 1117.46
and radio but what

1123.98 --> 1131.059
that's like a category error

1128.24 --> 1134.08
one doesn't exclude the other hey Julio

1131.059 --> 1134.08
cabin good to see you

1147.14 --> 1152.1200000000001
Man by the way

1149.9 --> 1154.66
seriously

1152.12 --> 1154.6599999999999
like

1154.7 --> 1160.16
I've just been thinking right in the

1157.4 --> 1164.48
Netherlands they have this idiotic

1160.16 --> 1166.3400000000001
system or any tobacco sold at regular

1164.48 --> 1169.34
stores and all that has to have like

1166.34 --> 1171.6789999999999
these ridiculous

1169.34 --> 1173.9599999999998
warning things on them

1171.679 --> 1179.299
telling you like oh smoking will kill

1173.96 --> 1182.3600000000001
you oh smoking will lead to like severe

1179.299 --> 1185.179
medical conditions and all that

1182.36 --> 1189.9799999999998
and it's just like here like oh

1185.179 --> 1192.679
smoking it causes strokes and serious

1189.98 --> 1194.3600000000001
handicaps and I'm like dude what the

1192.679 --> 1196.9
[ __ ]

1194.36 --> 1196.8999999999999
hold on

1197.419 --> 1202.46
like seriously

1199.58 --> 1204.9189999999999
like oh no this smoking oh it's so

1202.46 --> 1207.26
dangerous but oh go take your jab though

1204.919 --> 1208.64
you know government recommends you to

1207.26 --> 1212.059
take the Jab

1208.64 --> 1215.6000000000001
but no it's this smoking that causes the

1212.059 --> 1219.7
serious handicaps in the

1215.6 --> 1219.6999999999998
and The Strokes and all that oh

1220.58 --> 1225.559
like it was already annoying enough that

1223.039 --> 1227.48
they did this for like the last 10 or

1225.559 --> 1229.82
more years I don't remember when they

1227.48 --> 1231.5
started doing that but now it's just

1229.82 --> 1236.1399999999999
extra egregious

1231.5 --> 1240.08
so I'm laying down another demand

1236.14 --> 1241.4
and that is if when this Corona [ __ ] is

1240.08 --> 1245.24
gonna end

1241.4 --> 1248.6000000000001
then I want those rules to be retracted

1245.24 --> 1251.0
because it's absolutely absurd that

1248.6 --> 1252.98
anything out there

1251.0 --> 1256.34
should be forced to do something like

1252.98 --> 1258.98
this and I bet that all these people

1256.34 --> 1261.1999999999998
they're either just actors it's just a

1258.98 --> 1264.559
complete act or some of the more medical

1261.2 --> 1266.419
situations it's just a scam like they

1264.559 --> 1269.4189999999999
got in an accident

1266.419 --> 1270.7990000000002
whatever and then it's just like oh oh

1269.419 --> 1273.8600000000001
you want to

1270.799 --> 1276.08
we can take some of that the price the

1273.86 --> 1280.84
medical price away if you do this photo

1276.08 --> 1280.84
op and just say that this happened

1281.72 --> 1286.76
it's ridiculous

1284.6 --> 1288.3799999999999
I wonder why cannabis from government

1286.76 --> 1290.48
what are you talking about George

1288.38 --> 1292.2800000000002
Sanford I have no idea what that even

1290.48 --> 1295.059
means there's no cannabis from

1292.28 --> 1295.059
government here

1295.28 --> 1299.98
it was tobacco it wasn't cannabis

1303.38 --> 1306.64
a flatter Sage

1307.22 --> 1311.419
they ever definitely linked smoking took

1309.98 --> 1314.44
answer no

1311.419 --> 1314.44
no they didn't

1317.299 --> 1321.679
right and

1318.98 --> 1323.659
like I even think that it's the main

1321.679 --> 1325.64
problem they steam each other the main

1323.659 --> 1328.5800000000002
problem isn't even the tobacco the

1325.64 --> 1331.2800000000002
problem is the processing

1328.58 --> 1335.36
right it's just the same [ __ ] with food

1331.28 --> 1338.48
right food get it fresh

1335.36 --> 1341.1789999999999
don't pasteurize your milk Etc and it's

1338.48 --> 1343.4
like super epic but it does spoil and

1341.179 --> 1345.38
yeah if you eat spoiled food that's not

1343.4 --> 1347.6000000000001
very good for you right it gives

1345.38 --> 1351.679
problems gives toxicity

1347.6 --> 1354.74
but yeah so pre-packaged [ __ ] that is La

1351.679 --> 1357.8600000000001
meant to let stand in warehouses for

1354.74 --> 1361.7
very long and still be sold in a

1357.86 --> 1363.86
supermarket those have extra [ __ ] added

1361.7 --> 1366.32
to them often one way or another they're

1363.86 --> 1370.1589999999999
like pasteurized or whatever

1366.32 --> 1372.74
and that makes it a lot less healthy

1370.159 --> 1374.7800000000002
that's the thing that's actually causing

1372.74 --> 1376.94
these problems and the same goes in my

1374.78 --> 1378.6789999999999
opinion for tobacco if you just take the

1376.94 --> 1382.48
raw tobacco

1378.679 --> 1382.48
exactly as is from the plant

1383.24 --> 1387.88
there's like that's actually medicinal

1388.159 --> 1392.9
it's just that

1390.02 --> 1395.059
the [ __ ] they do to it right and

1392.9 --> 1397.159
especially more mainstream tobacco

1395.059 --> 1399.44
companies they've done all kinds of [ __ ]

1397.159 --> 1401.6000000000001
they're like what McDonald's does to

1399.44 --> 1405.3200000000002
their food so if you can even call it

1401.6 --> 1407.6589999999999
food right mainstream tobacco

1405.32 --> 1410.12
does that to their tobacco they put all

1407.659 --> 1412.22
kinds of [ __ ] in there to make it more

1410.12 --> 1414.62
easily burning or

1412.22 --> 1417.5
for flavor enhancement all kinds of

1414.62 --> 1419.6
nonsense and that's actually what I

1417.5 --> 1423.08
think is causing the cancer

1419.6 --> 1426.559
and all these disgusting things

1423.08 --> 1428.72
issues just general health issues a

1426.559 --> 1431.98
health burden it's not the tobacco it's

1428.72 --> 1431.98
what they put into it

1441.2 --> 1445.159
it's the same Mornings in the UK yeah I

1443.059 --> 1448.58
think it might be like a European thing

1445.159 --> 1453.0800000000002
but it's it's offensive

1448.58 --> 1455.059
and it's psychosomatically unhealthy

1453.08 --> 1457.6399999999999
doing this

1455.059 --> 1461.6
is not a deterrent

1457.64 --> 1467.24
for people to smoke it isn't what it is

1461.6 --> 1469.8799999999999
is a psychosomatic attack a suggestion a

1467.24 --> 1472.64
suggestion of Doom

1469.88 --> 1476.24
and horror

1472.64 --> 1479.6000000000001
right and that will rub off on people

1476.24 --> 1482.84
that the the imagery here that

1479.6 --> 1484.82
influences people the message that is

1482.84 --> 1488.6589999999999
what influences people people will

1484.82 --> 1491.48
believe that and then conjure it by

1488.659 --> 1495.7990000000002
accident because they believe it

1491.48 --> 1498.279
yeah it's a psychosomatic attack and it

1495.799 --> 1498.279
should stop

1531.14 --> 1533.679
right

1569.62 --> 1573.76
yeah hello Nathan by the way

1577.23 --> 1580.279
[Music]

1578.84 --> 1583.779
right

1580.279 --> 1587.299
but yeah I look

1583.779 --> 1589.46
governments and especially like the

1587.299 --> 1593.6589999999999
image of government they've spilled the

1589.46 --> 1596.419
beans with this supposed medical crisis

1593.659 --> 1599.3600000000001
that is proving to be a giant made-up

1596.419 --> 1601.5200000000002
scam in many ways

1599.36 --> 1604.299
in many ways already right oh they're

1601.52 --> 1607.82
still leaving some

1604.299 --> 1612.86
some ideas out there the trees back to

1607.82 --> 1615.1399999999999
blame but in general it's just

1612.86 --> 1617.36
they played their hand the governments

1615.14 --> 1619.5200000000002
played their hand

1617.36 --> 1621.799
we should know now

1619.52 --> 1625.46
that government

1621.799 --> 1628.22
can't be trusted with their health

1625.46 --> 1630.44
and that's not just for getting a cold

1628.22 --> 1633.1000000000001
that kind of nonsense and all that

1630.44 --> 1635.659
what's still going on although it's

1633.1 --> 1638.4189999999999
slowly retreating

1635.659 --> 1640.5200000000002
but with other things too it's like

1638.419 --> 1644.0800000000002
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

1640.52 --> 1644.08
talking about you're Liars

1644.96 --> 1650.3600000000001
right

1647.0 --> 1651.74
who initiated this who initiated this

1650.36 --> 1653.84
system

1651.74 --> 1656.299
I think it's those people I think it's

1653.84 --> 1658.6999999999998
the same [ __ ] people that are

1656.299 --> 1661.76
attacking us now with Jabs

1658.7 --> 1663.02
and restrictions

1661.76 --> 1666.559
and all that

1663.02 --> 1669.44
lockdowns it's the same people

1666.559 --> 1673.1
and we should recognize that and realize

1669.44 --> 1675.5
what else did they do what other Loops

1673.1 --> 1679.2199999999998
did they make us jump through that are

1675.5 --> 1682.039
complete scams maybe it's time to take

1679.22 --> 1686.799
care of those as well

1682.039 --> 1686.799
you know medical system is pretty much

1686.899 --> 1691.6399999999999
played its hand now

1689.539 --> 1694.82
expose itself

1691.64 --> 1698.3600000000001
to us and how things are being done to

1694.82 --> 1699.9189999999999
us we should take care of the rest too

1698.36 --> 1701.36
now

1699.919 --> 1703.5800000000002
really

1701.36 --> 1706.58
you could actually see this as a great

1703.58 --> 1710.059
opportunity for a crisis

1706.58 --> 1713.4189999999999
I get an opportunity for a crisis reset

1710.059 --> 1716.96
but in this case a public reset the

1713.419 --> 1720.5590000000002
people resetting themselves not for the

1716.96 --> 1724.96
government or for these for these

1720.559 --> 1724.96
crazy Nazi wannabe clowns

1725.84 --> 1731.1789999999999
but in the face of the knowledge

1728.0 --> 1735.559
attained the collective the actual

1731.179 --> 1738.5
public people Collective knowledge

1735.559 --> 1740.899
government cannot be trusted with health

1738.5 --> 1743.26
issues and health recommendations they

1740.899 --> 1743.26
cannot

1743.779 --> 1750.62
so maybe it's time to move on those

1747.08 --> 1753.3799999999999
other institutes or whatever is forcing

1750.62 --> 1756.82
all that garbage as well

1753.38 --> 1756.8200000000002
let's move in people

1759.919 --> 1763.039
get it out

1761.24 --> 1766.76
just

1763.039 --> 1770.0
end it end the nonsense and the the

1766.76 --> 1773.559
medical scam nonsense the suggestions

1770.0 --> 1773.559
all this [ __ ]

1792.02 --> 1794.62
right

1824.299 --> 1831.2
what did humans do before doctors

1828.14 --> 1833.1200000000001
well they just sat through it they just

1831.2 --> 1836.74
seen oh it's just a natural Hazard it's

1833.12 --> 1836.7399999999998
just the body working things out

1836.84 --> 1839.3799999999999
right

1840.559 --> 1846.559
like in the old days sounds weird maybe

1844.34 --> 1848.84
but it's just like yeah people had

1846.559 --> 1851.98
toothaches too

1848.84 --> 1854.059
especially if like more City Life and

1851.98 --> 1857.059
hazardous food

1854.059 --> 1859.899
especially after sugar was introduced

1857.059 --> 1859.899
raw sugar

1860.6 --> 1866.6
cane sugar and all that

1863.96 --> 1868.58
but before that they had tooth X2 and

1866.6 --> 1871.82
they were just like no just sit through

1868.58 --> 1875.4189999999999
it just like we don't care you just man

1871.82 --> 1877.399
it up you know maybe you'll get a little

1875.419 --> 1880.24
bit more Angry well just use that anger

1877.399 --> 1880.2399999999998
then right

1880.58 --> 1885.62
just use it for something

1882.679 --> 1890.0800000000002
bloodletting what that yeah

1885.62 --> 1890.08
that's yeah that's just ridiculous

1893.059 --> 1897.26
it's more like psychosomatic to even do

1895.399 --> 1899.6
that

1897.26 --> 1901.34
but who was doing that the bloodletting

1899.6 --> 1905.4399999999998
nonsense

1901.34 --> 1905.4399999999998
that was like doctors

1906.38 --> 1912.74
and maybe healers too maybe healers kind

1909.5 --> 1914.6
of roll into that maybe people just

1912.74 --> 1917.299
started demanding it

1914.6 --> 1920.1789999999999
I think that the bloodletting

1917.299 --> 1923.12
stuff is really

1920.179 --> 1927.5590000000002
a psychological demon scam I think that

1923.12 --> 1930.1999999999998
it was kind of like insanity

1927.559 --> 1932.48
that probably I don't know certain

1930.2 --> 1934.279
nobility or whatever we're doing and

1932.48 --> 1936.32
then everybody was like oh well there

1934.279 --> 1938.84
are rulers they know best which is the

1936.32 --> 1940.519
most idiotic assumption ever

1938.84 --> 1943.22
they're doing that so we're gonna do

1940.519 --> 1945.679
that too because that's what works right

1943.22 --> 1947.779
and that's how it spread it just got in

1945.679 --> 1950.3200000000002
like a crazy

1947.779 --> 1950.32
thing

1953.72 --> 1959.24
I don't know I think bloodletting is

1956.179 --> 1961.96
just ridiculous I really do it is

1959.24 --> 1961.96
ridiculous

1967.7 --> 1973.1000000000001
like even when you think about it like

1971.0 --> 1974.779
on the spiritual level it's crazy it's

1973.1 --> 1977.24
almost like oh what you're gonna

1974.779 --> 1978.2
literally make a blood sacrifice to a

1977.24 --> 1982.94
spirit

1978.2 --> 1986.0
to hope that he will self your situation

1982.94 --> 1990.0800000000002
that sounds pretty damn creepy to me and

1986.0 --> 1992.48
not Medical in any form like what is the

1990.08 --> 1995.62
medical aspect of that

1992.48 --> 1995.6200000000001
makes no sense

1999.679 --> 2002.519
oh just

2003.64 --> 2010.179
leeches yeah but leeches do actually

2006.46 --> 2013.059
work just like snake oil yeah

2010.179 --> 2016.019
leeches and snake oil work

2013.059 --> 2016.019
you know why

2016.659 --> 2021.46
a leeches actually excrete

2019.6 --> 2023.98
aspirin

2021.46 --> 2027.3990000000001
when they suck on you

2023.98 --> 2029.799
they inject aspirin it's like a blood

2027.399 --> 2031.779
thinner but it also has medical

2029.799 --> 2033.58
qualities

2031.779 --> 2037.059
yeah

2033.58 --> 2040.24
so leeches actually work

2037.059 --> 2042.22
to a certain degree of course

2040.24 --> 2044.08
and snake oil

2042.22 --> 2046.059
also works

2044.08 --> 2048.639
it works for a lot of thing it doesn't

2046.059 --> 2051.419
work for everything but it does actually

2048.639 --> 2051.4190000000003
do things

2053.139 --> 2058.139
it's crazy I've never tried it myself

2055.419 --> 2058.1389999999997
but

2062.919 --> 2071.339
it's very typical

2066.579 --> 2071.3390000000004
it's how it's typical how easy

2072.399 --> 2079.24
bad rumors can be spread and then seed

2075.879 --> 2082.54
themselves in the collective mind for

2079.24 --> 2084.7
hundreds of years where people will Echo

2082.54 --> 2087.579
something they don't even know where it

2084.7 --> 2089.4399999999996
came from they're just heard it they

2087.579 --> 2091.179
filled in the story themselves then

2089.44 --> 2093.2200000000003
everybody pretty much does the exact

2091.179 --> 2095.859
same thing then is like oh so everybody

2093.22 --> 2099.8199999999997
agrees on this even though nobody

2095.859 --> 2103.359
actually knows where it even came from

2099.82 --> 2107.2000000000003
right and so these crazy tenacious

2103.359 --> 2109.5989999999997
rumors that are made as examples of

2107.2 --> 2111.24
something like they're made into

2109.599 --> 2115.119
mistakes

2111.24 --> 2116.4399999999996
blatant mistakes are made into iconic

2115.119 --> 2119.02
thinking

2116.44 --> 2122.8
to echo through the age it's almost like

2119.02 --> 2125.56
a a crazy joke

2122.8 --> 2129.579
whose snake oil salesman Snickers that's

2125.56 --> 2131.7999999999997
that's snake oil salesman is synonymous

2129.579 --> 2133.0600000000004
to scammer

2131.8 --> 2136.26
but

2133.06 --> 2136.2599999999998
but it worked

2138.099 --> 2142.1400000000003
and still it's echoed

2142.839 --> 2147.04
that's like

2144.579 --> 2150.0
Grappler magic or something

2147.04 --> 2150.0
it has to be

2150.88 --> 2157.119
it's like spreading crazy rumors and

2153.7 --> 2159.46
making it into like Universal thinking

2157.119 --> 2162.839
for your own

2159.46 --> 2162.839
Market benefit

2164.92 --> 2168.54
and it happens a lot

2180.339 --> 2186.54
that's what they did with the sphere of

2182.26 --> 2186.5400000000004
theory yeah no doubt No Doubt

2195.16 --> 2200.859
yeah I know Adam price but everybody's

2198.099 --> 2202.54
heard of that stupid saying and every

2200.859 --> 2204.96
time I hear it I didn't noise the [ __ ]

2202.54 --> 2204.96
out of me

2205.0 --> 2212.8
like it's a scam the idea that snake oil

2208.3 --> 2215.1400000000003
is a scammer is the scam

2212.8 --> 2218.32
it's a deterrent it's a deterrent to

2215.14 --> 2222.0
something that actually has legitimate

2218.32 --> 2222.0
medicinal qualities to it

2224.2 --> 2230.02
right it's not really all that different

2227.32 --> 2232.9
from in the 90s where people were like

2230.02 --> 2235.359
oh we want medicinal cannabis we want to

2232.9 --> 2237.579
use that for in the medical system and

2235.359 --> 2241.56
they were like oh yeah the crazy people

2237.579 --> 2245.579
oh they're just Junkies

2241.56 --> 2249.52
it's that it the snake oil salesman

2245.579 --> 2251.6800000000003
identifying as a scammer right

2249.52 --> 2253.9
it's that [ __ ]

2251.68 --> 2256.7799999999997
it's Medical

2253.9 --> 2260.859
devil propaganda

2256.78 --> 2265.3
to make you doubt things that work and

2260.859 --> 2268.42
then play into their little game

2265.3 --> 2270.28
for for you to be their experimental

2268.42 --> 2273.7000000000003
subject

2270.28 --> 2277.7200000000003
medical experimentation subject

2273.7 --> 2280.1189999999997
thanks to widespread mind control lies

2277.72 --> 2283.2
making you distrust things out there

2280.119 --> 2283.2000000000003
that actually work

2283.3 --> 2289.54
it's it's straight out mind control

2286.06 --> 2291.52
can't get more straight out mind control

2289.54 --> 2294.52
than that

2291.52 --> 2296.92
having entire sayings that Echo Through

2294.52 --> 2300.599
the Ages that are a hundred percent

2296.92 --> 2300.599
reversed World lies

2300.94 --> 2306.7200000000003
for your own Market

2304.14 --> 2309.5789999999997
beneficial purposes

2306.72 --> 2312.839
is super sick

2309.579 --> 2312.8390000000004
Super Evil

2355.54 --> 2361.24
yeah but anyway the other Andrew yeah

2358.0 --> 2363.46
maybe in ancient Greece in Egypt

2361.24 --> 2365.9199999999996
bloodletting was a thing too

2363.46 --> 2370.079
but why though

2365.92 --> 2370.079
it doesn't make a lot of sense to me

2370.9 --> 2376.359
like I cannot fit the picture of how

2373.72 --> 2379.68
that would actually work

2376.359 --> 2379.68
like really work

2380.44 --> 2384.4
I mean

2382.42 --> 2386.76
it would almost make more sense that

2384.4 --> 2390.46
they would bloodlet just to

2386.76 --> 2394.3590000000004
expose the blood to analyze it like oh

2390.46 --> 2397.54
how red is it how blue is it how quickly

2394.359 --> 2399.8199999999997
does it coagulate how quickly does it

2397.54 --> 2403.0
change color does it rust right you

2399.82 --> 2406.3
could use

2403.0 --> 2408.64
the study of blood exposed in the open

2406.3 --> 2411.579
to determine like somebody's Health

2408.64 --> 2414.8799999999997
potentially right use it like oh

2411.579 --> 2417.3390000000004
very early laboratory checking

2414.88 --> 2419.28
right that would be for me a more

2417.339 --> 2422.2599999999998
legitimate reason

2419.28 --> 2425.02
for the Ancients to spill a little blood

2422.26 --> 2426.46
just to check it like well how is this

2425.02 --> 2428.8
Blood how what's the quality of this

2426.46 --> 2431.619
Blood what is in this Blood right to get

2428.8 --> 2432.4
a quick diagnosis of what's inside the

2431.619 --> 2434.6800000000003
body

2432.4 --> 2437.38
the blood is there right

2434.68 --> 2441.2799999999997
that makes more sense than oh we have to

2437.38 --> 2445.42
relieve the blood blah blah for this let

2441.28 --> 2448.78
the evil spirits out it makes no sense

2445.42 --> 2452.8
that part makes no sense I think it's

2448.78 --> 2455.5600000000004
lies I think it's another lie

2452.8 --> 2458.319
planted planted there by medical

2455.56 --> 2460.9
industry

2458.319 --> 2465.04
or in this case before the medical

2460.9 --> 2465.04
industry by necromancers

2469.08 --> 2472.21
[Music]

2475.0 --> 2480.339
live blood doctors right yeah yeah

2477.64 --> 2483.7599999999998
that's a whole thing now study of blood

2480.339 --> 2486.7
it's and it is pretty remarkable right

2483.76 --> 2490.119
now bloodletting

2486.7 --> 2491.98
for that to analyze it right in an early

2490.119 --> 2494.7400000000002
stage just see oh how quickly does

2491.98 --> 2496.2400000000002
coagulate how quickly does it rust to

2494.74 --> 2498.64
determine what's the quality of that

2496.24 --> 2501.52
person's blood that makes more sense to

2498.64 --> 2505.1189999999997
me than oh we have to let the blood out

2501.52 --> 2508.24
for evil spirits to come out that sounds

2505.119 --> 2511.599
like a complete [ __ ] nonsense story

2508.24 --> 2512.6189999999997
that they might tell peons just to shut

2511.599 --> 2514.96
them up

2512.619 --> 2517.6600000000003
to stop them from asking questions or

2514.96 --> 2520.42
something right but practically that

2517.66 --> 2521.98
makes absolutely no sense and people

2520.42 --> 2525.1800000000003
that would have practiced it makes no

2521.98 --> 2525.18
sense to even believe that

2526.9 --> 2532.619
does eating snake meat provide health

2529.3 --> 2532.619
benefits no not really

2533.14 --> 2536.22
it's just meat

2536.5 --> 2542.319
raw I don't know about bro I don't know

2539.38 --> 2544.599
about raw meat eating in general I hear

2542.319 --> 2547.18
that some people do that

2544.599 --> 2549.819
it's not my thing

2547.18 --> 2552.64
I don't know

2549.819 --> 2555.2799999999997
I hear that snake kind of just

2552.64 --> 2558.5989999999997
I don't know tastes like chicken it's

2555.28 --> 2558.599
just a little bit more tough

2560.14 --> 2563.4
I've never tasted it

2569.92 --> 2576.42
hello Aries 106.

2572.619 --> 2576.42
blood love it that's gross

2579.16 --> 2582.1189999999997
foreign

2591.22 --> 2598.7999999999997
maybe they did it medically for injuries

2594.94 --> 2598.8
to keep infection out

2600.16 --> 2602.819
what

2603.52 --> 2606.119
no

2607.079 --> 2613.6600000000003
but if you're saying that

2611.02 --> 2616.54
blood let it look but that's still kind

2613.66 --> 2619.0
of ridiculous but yeah maybe

2616.54 --> 2621.7799999999997
bloodletting eventually

2619.0 --> 2625.42
like it was maybe part of an original

2621.78 --> 2627.8190000000004
procedure idea where indeed somebody's

2625.42 --> 2630.579
wounded it starts festering you kind of

2627.819 --> 2633.52
have to break it open for the pus to

2630.579 --> 2635.44
come out right it's super gross but you

2633.52 --> 2637.78
have to maybe

2635.44 --> 2640.66
that's where it came from it's like you

2637.78 --> 2642.76
have to let the evil spirits out the pus

2640.66 --> 2645.339
out of the wound it's not actually about

2642.76 --> 2647.8590000000004
blood right but then maybe other people

2645.339 --> 2649.54
oh I I can do that too and they didn't

2647.859 --> 2651.5789999999997
understand it and they would just start

2649.54 --> 2653.92
cutting in in knots

2651.579 --> 2658.6800000000003
wounds right they thought that maybe

2653.92 --> 2658.6800000000003
that works for not infections

2659.56 --> 2666.5789999999997
right so maybe yeah maybe they just saw

2663.4 --> 2669.04
people basically oh there's an festering

2666.579 --> 2671.079
wound open it up like

2669.04 --> 2672.94
put a cut in it and the pus comes out

2671.079 --> 2674.38
and they're like oh gross the Evil's

2672.94 --> 2677.02
coming out

2674.38 --> 2679.3
and then they thought oh maybe oh this

2677.02 --> 2681.7
person is sick well maybe that's gonna

2679.3 --> 2683.98
work again and just cut

2681.7 --> 2687.64
and it's like no blood's coming out just

2683.98 --> 2690.16
red so it's not working like that

2687.64 --> 2692.94
oh well

2690.16 --> 2692.94
I don't know

2708.099 --> 2710.46
hmm

2716.319 --> 2721.079
what if it was about how it feels yeah

2722.76 --> 2728.619
ah very good surfing yeah yeah I already

2725.92 --> 2735.3
shared that

2728.619 --> 2735.3
and leeches is with two e's not with EA

2738.4 --> 2741.599
hey Jeff guy said

2744.52 --> 2747.3
Hogan

2759.4 --> 2764.2000000000003
right but yeah if you think about it

2761.38 --> 2766.6600000000003
like that bloodletting like oh the story

2764.2 --> 2769.839
is supposed to oh if you just cut and

2766.66 --> 2772.74
then let the evil spirits out that

2769.839 --> 2776.2
sounds like a really dumb interpretation

2772.74 --> 2779.2
really dumb of of a medical procedure

2776.2 --> 2782.0789999999997
where somebody has a festering wound and

2779.2 --> 2785.02
then the doctor makes a cut for the

2782.079 --> 2788.7400000000002
pressure to to get off and then the pus

2785.02 --> 2791.8
usually comes out right gross

2788.74 --> 2793.9599999999996
it sounds like that that's what it

2791.8 --> 2795.28
sounds like

2793.96 --> 2798.819
right

2795.28 --> 2801.76
make a cut then the bad spirits come out

2798.819 --> 2804.52
literally stinks right it stinks it

2801.76 --> 2807.2200000000003
literally stinks pus coming out right it

2804.52 --> 2809.619
bad spirits oh yeah bad spirits indeed

2807.22 --> 2812.0789999999997
it makes perfect sense that's the

2809.619 --> 2816.04
procedure it's not actually letting

2812.079 --> 2819.579
blood drain it's cutting a wound to let

2816.04 --> 2822.4
the pus out I think that is literally

2819.579 --> 2824.3390000000004
what that is

2822.4 --> 2826.7200000000003
and people might have just

2824.339 --> 2830.319
misinterpreted and then just started

2826.72 --> 2832.5989999999997
doing that like some weirdo LARP medical

2830.319 --> 2838.5
procedure that they didn't understand

2832.599 --> 2838.5
perhaps right right that makes sense

2841.43 --> 2844.66
[Music]

2849.73 --> 2852.9
[Music]

2858.4 --> 2865.38
to kept in balance

2862.119 --> 2865.38
all righty then

2867.64 --> 2871.319
Brad Waters thanks for that

2872.859 --> 2876.7
keeping a balance in the body however

2875.02 --> 2878.98
you can see if it is always a good thing

2876.7 --> 2881.5
of course

2878.98 --> 2883.96
although

2881.5 --> 2886.72
keeping it in Balance does that mean

2883.96 --> 2888.88
that just letting blood good blood drain

2886.72 --> 2892.0789999999997
keeps things in balance that doesn't

2888.88 --> 2892.079
make any logical sense

2892.24 --> 2896.5
but if that implies yeah yeah there's

2894.819 --> 2898.0
all kinds of things that happen in the

2896.5 --> 2900.46
body they have to find a balance and

2898.0 --> 2903.4
then oh look it's festering oh then it's

2900.46 --> 2905.8
out of balance now that garbage needs to

2903.4 --> 2907.96
come out it needs to be cleaned

2905.8 --> 2910.5
right if you think like that it does

2907.96 --> 2910.5
make sense

2916.96 --> 2922.059
what

2919.42 --> 2923.98
blood donation is something else George

2922.059 --> 2927.7000000000003
Sanford

2923.98 --> 2931.2400000000002
that I don't think bloodletting was for

2927.7 --> 2933.46
for Infusion purposes

2931.24 --> 2936.5789999999997
or maybe it was back then

2933.46 --> 2939.16
maybe they were literally blood bagging

2936.579 --> 2940.48
they were just taking like

2939.16 --> 2943.66
was it

2940.48 --> 2945.819
sheep's bladders or something and using

2943.66 --> 2948.16
them as blood drips

2945.819 --> 2950.98
I don't know man dude what did they

2948.16 --> 2955.2999999999997
could have done in the past we so under

2950.98 --> 2958.96
we all learned to underestimate

2955.3 --> 2962.2000000000003
how smart and how inventive

2958.96 --> 2963.94
people could have done things so maybe

2962.2 --> 2967.18
in freaking

2963.94 --> 2970.359
a thousand BC they used ships bladders

2967.18 --> 2972.819
as and then let people

2970.359 --> 2974.74
basically

2972.819 --> 2977.38
drain their blood

2974.74 --> 2980.14
and then actually absorb it in the

2977.38 --> 2982.119
bladder or something and then use it as

2980.14 --> 2984.0989999999997
a transfusion I don't know man they

2982.119 --> 2986.6800000000003
could have done it by the way yeah too

2984.099 --> 2988.54
but how do you make a tube you know that

2986.68 --> 2992.8799999999997
without plastic

2988.54 --> 2992.88
just get it all gets a bit complicated

2992.92 --> 2998.6800000000003
I guess organs like

2995.88 --> 3001.079
intestine or something cleaned out

2998.68 --> 3005.8799999999997
intestine could be dried up to be made

3001.079 --> 3008.6400000000003
like a an infusion straw who knows man

3005.88 --> 3011.04
I think it's possible that the Ancients

3008.64 --> 3016.0989999999997
were much more creative

3011.04 --> 3016.099
medically even that we take for granted

3028.68 --> 3034.0989999999997
ha Aries 106. that's really gross

3037.8 --> 3040.52
cover

3041.099 --> 3046.7400000000002
well maybe that's what came out of it

3044.579 --> 3049.26
it's just that the sight of blood may

3046.74 --> 3051.0589999999997
have inspired some to get all vampiric

3049.26 --> 3053.7000000000003
and [ __ ] and they were like oh yeah just

3051.059 --> 3055.38
keep developing that who knows

3053.7 --> 3057.74
I don't think that's where it came from

3055.38 --> 3057.7400000000002
though

3062.48 --> 3067.079
and then like oh yeah we we're just

3065.22 --> 3068.3999999999996
doing medical procedure no that's not

3067.079 --> 3071.6400000000003
how it started

3068.4 --> 3075.96
no that's ridiculous

3071.64 --> 3078.2999999999997
but maybe doctor's effort having like

3075.96 --> 3080.88
seen a lot of blood

3078.3 --> 3085.3390000000004
got a bit curious and then had yeah

3080.88 --> 3085.339
developed some weird freaky habits

3088.5 --> 3091.4
who knows

3097.02 --> 3100.579
flat part of me

3112.94 --> 3116.42
trigger flurf

3118.8 --> 3124.88
thank you for the reporting slo-mo moon

3121.92 --> 3124.88
buggy seems like

3126.619 --> 3132.839
the the anti-flat Earth are actually

3130.859 --> 3134.819
had a pretty decent statement yeah

3132.839 --> 3136.14
because humans always have been smart

3134.819 --> 3139.38
and clever

3136.14 --> 3141.359
and it's true yeah and they always knew

3139.38 --> 3143.2200000000003
the Earth was flat and they always knew

3141.359 --> 3146.2799999999997
that humans were

3143.22 --> 3147.9599999999996
despite being very smart and inventive

3146.28 --> 3150.96
also

3147.96 --> 3154.38
when they're not that they're incredibly

3150.96 --> 3157.8
stupid and willingness their willingness

3154.38 --> 3160.44
to be part of stupid games

3157.8 --> 3163.619
the willingness to be deceived is also

3160.44 --> 3166.099
not to be underestimated

3163.619 --> 3166.099
right

3168.359 --> 3172.7599999999998
and they knew that and they played into

3170.46 --> 3172.76
that

3199.619 --> 3204.0
we know when something is wrong even if

3201.96 --> 3206.099
we can't figure out exactly what it is I

3204.0 --> 3209.4
blame God yeah

3206.099 --> 3211.619
oh blame him thank God thank God that

3209.4 --> 3214.2200000000003
even if your cognition doesn't have the

3211.619 --> 3214.2200000000003
tools available

3214.26 --> 3219.96
to even figure out what something is

3216.3 --> 3222.7200000000003
that we still have like this deeper

3219.96 --> 3226.94
feeling based knowledge that reaches

3222.72 --> 3226.9399999999996
Beyond standard cognition

3228.18 --> 3232.2599999999998
and that we can feel like there's

3230.339 --> 3235.2
something wrong here

3232.26 --> 3237.119
like we can know where it will go even

3235.2 --> 3239.5789999999997
if we don't understand it because we

3237.119 --> 3241.079
will still be able to feel things about

3239.579 --> 3243.48
it

3241.079 --> 3248.1600000000003
and when I mean feel things about it not

3243.48 --> 3252.9
like have your ego develop an opinion

3248.16 --> 3256.64
about it but actual raw sensory data

3252.9 --> 3256.64
those types of feelings

3257.099 --> 3260.3
feel something often

3263.7 --> 3271.02
like you can feel intention

3266.76 --> 3273.7200000000003
even if the thing that has it

3271.02 --> 3276.96
that is the one you're scanning doesn't

3273.72 --> 3279.18
consciously realize it right they have

3276.96 --> 3282.119
an intention and they're not fully aware

3279.18 --> 3284.16
of it you can still as an outsider feel

3282.119 --> 3287.299
that intention

3284.16 --> 3287.299
you can feel it

3288.0 --> 3295.079
even if the subject you're scanning

3291.2 --> 3297.24
doesn't have direct conscious access to

3295.079 --> 3299.2200000000003
it they don't have to be in the full

3297.24 --> 3302.299
know of what they're doing you can still

3299.22 --> 3302.299
feel what it is

3313.68 --> 3320.5989999999997
how does one get timed out

3316.44 --> 3320.599
uh you have to have a wrench

3325.98 --> 3329.54
oh yeah

3330.059 --> 3334.02
all right let's see yeah you can't

3331.98 --> 3336.059
communicate if you have some good input

3334.02 --> 3337.98
I don't care even if you're a troll if

3336.059 --> 3339.599
you have a good input if you have if you

3337.98 --> 3342.42
say something true

3339.599 --> 3345.42
you can stay until you stop saying true

3342.42 --> 3347.76
things and then you have to go

3345.42 --> 3349.98
if you just come in

3347.76 --> 3353.2990000000004
to be an ass

3349.98 --> 3353.299
but then you just go

3362.78 --> 3366.98
little Remnant crossover

3374.52 --> 3378.359
and I can't believe these people

3377.22 --> 3381.72
these

3378.359 --> 3384.2599999999998
troll spawning [ __ ] actually think

3381.72 --> 3384.2599999999998
they're smart

3384.599 --> 3388.52
you're the dumbest [ __ ] in the world

3390.599 --> 3395.94
you're so dumb

3392.579 --> 3397.799
you can't even control

3395.94 --> 3402.66
yourself

3397.799 --> 3406.2599999999998
in order to establish an actual grounded

3402.66 --> 3409.3999999999996
stable personal identity to represent

3406.26 --> 3409.4
yourself with

3409.44 --> 3413.16
that you can actually build with and

3411.72 --> 3415.98
build respect

3413.16 --> 3419.04
no no you have to go Anonymous and

3415.98 --> 3422.4
respawn be unwelcome be a piece of [ __ ]

3419.04 --> 3425.22
then specialize in repeating that

3422.4 --> 3426.48
moving further and further away from a

3425.22 --> 3429.02
stable

3426.48 --> 3432.839
self-reliant

3429.02 --> 3434.339
respectable identity yeah no you're the

3432.839 --> 3437.04
dumb [ __ ]

3434.339 --> 3440.04
Harley Bronte

3437.04 --> 3441.7799999999997
troll Defender you're the dumb [ __ ] not

3440.04 --> 3444.599
me not us

3441.78 --> 3447.3590000000004
we're all ourselves here

3444.599 --> 3451.319
we are all out in the open I I'm not

3447.359 --> 3454.16
making a new sock account yeah I'm me

3451.319 --> 3454.16
I'm Arwin

3455.04 --> 3461.94
my identity is plain and clear I'm very

3458.339 --> 3465.0
direct and open I'm the smart one

3461.94 --> 3468.7200000000003
because I don't try to hide

3465.0 --> 3471.24
my indecences and my identity

3468.72 --> 3475.3799999999997
behind sock accounts

3471.24 --> 3478.3799999999997
because I can do that I can just be me

3475.38 --> 3482.099
and be risky at it yeah I have risky

3478.38 --> 3486.1800000000003
traits I know yeah I'm still doing it

3482.099 --> 3488.819
because I'm not a coward if you hide

3486.18 --> 3492.24
if you constantly hide your identity if

3488.819 --> 3495.18
you respawn stupid supposed funny names

3492.24 --> 3497.2799999999997
and just be a nagging tick in

3495.18 --> 3500.64
everybody's hair constantly

3497.28 --> 3502.92
you're not gonna build anything

3500.64 --> 3505.319
you're not gonna evolve spiritually

3502.92 --> 3508.819
Beyond

3505.319 --> 3508.819
because you don't build on anything

3510.059 --> 3514.099
you just get more annoying

3518.099 --> 3521.099
foreign

3531.059 --> 3538.8190000000004
they used sugar to stop wounds what what

3535.859 --> 3538.819
how does that work

3539.76 --> 3546.2990000000004
they made the patients eat sugar or they

3542.94 --> 3549.38
literally poured it in the wound

3546.299 --> 3549.38
how does that work

3551.819 --> 3556.94
this smart one yeah yeah that's right

3554.299 --> 3560.9
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] second today

3556.94 --> 3560.9
you're a [ __ ]

3565.44 --> 3572.04
you're an identity less cowardice

3570.0 --> 3574.74
little scumbag

3572.04 --> 3578.04
you're a [ __ ]

3574.74 --> 3580.7599999999998
yeah because you know why cowardice is

3578.04 --> 3580.7599999999998
[ __ ]

3581.66 --> 3586.04
fear is for the stupid

3586.44 --> 3591.92
you have it a lot of it you're a [ __ ]

3612.119 --> 3618.119
adding a bag of sugar to the workout bag

3615.78 --> 3621.1400000000003
well be careful though it also does

3618.119 --> 3621.1400000000003
attract ants

3645.079 --> 3649.319
why do you spend so much time addressing

3647.7 --> 3652.16
tools well because they're getting

3649.319 --> 3652.16
they're there

3652.68 --> 3657.0789999999997
you know they're in there so

3657.48 --> 3660.799
I would spend a lot of time

3663.119 --> 3669.96
but I just do address them you know

3667.5 --> 3674.96
like everything they say is all inside

3669.96 --> 3674.96
out and I will shove that in their face

3677.7 --> 3683.9399999999996
all right I'm not leaving them any room

3679.98 --> 3685.619
for comfortable illusions

3683.94 --> 3687.359
all right and that's what they think

3685.619 --> 3691.2200000000003
that they are doing to me and they're

3687.359 --> 3694.5589999999997
not they're just totally Inside Out

3691.22 --> 3696.0589999999997
ridiculous losers

3694.559 --> 3698.78
they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

3696.059 --> 3698.78
even doing anymore

3717.0 --> 3720.799
yeah yeah triggered slur from what a

3720.059 --> 3725.059
name

3720.799 --> 3725.059
interesting yeah they might have used

3725.4 --> 3731.339
uh what is it yeah sugar to absorb the

3728.7 --> 3734.2799999999997
water or the moist in the blood

3731.339 --> 3736.799
they could have also used like chalk for

3734.28 --> 3739.1400000000003
it or was it the

3736.799 --> 3741.24
burnt chalk although I wouldn't put it

3739.14 --> 3742.98
directly on a wound that would literally

3741.24 --> 3745.68
burn it

3742.98 --> 3746.7
but maybe a bandage with some of that in

3745.68 --> 3749.7
between

3746.7 --> 3752.7
or perhaps sugar but yeah you know if

3749.7 --> 3756.299
you leave a sugar bandage on a wound for

3752.7 --> 3759.02
very long that's probably not gonna be

3756.299 --> 3759.02
that great

3759.24 --> 3762.0789999999997
you know

3763.68 --> 3768.5989999999997
I mean the potential for that to start

3765.96 --> 3771.18
rotting is pretty high

3768.599 --> 3773.1600000000003
so it would only be like a first aid

3771.18 --> 3774.4199999999996
thing to basically try to stop the

3773.16 --> 3776.3999999999996
bleeding

3774.42 --> 3781.46
because I wouldn't leave like a sugar

3776.4 --> 3781.46
laced bandage on a wound for very long

3781.81 --> 3784.9
[Music]

3789.96 --> 3792.799
that's right

3792.9 --> 3797.76
anyway yeah for the more long-term

3795.319 --> 3799.44
healing I would generally recommend

3797.76 --> 3803.28
colloidal silver

3799.44 --> 3806.18
or back then a silver coin right you're

3803.28 --> 3806.1800000000003
on the battlefield

3806.22 --> 3812.9399999999996
you get shot or something or cut it yeah

3809.94 --> 3815.28
you you can't continue you're basically

3812.94 --> 3817.44
off to the medic

3815.28 --> 3819.2400000000002
and then yeah take your silver coin and

3817.44 --> 3822.48
put it in your mouth and maybe some

3819.24 --> 3824.8799999999997
surgery right because that's silver now

3822.48 --> 3825.96
these days we have colloidal silver that

3824.88 --> 3830.28
we can make

3825.96 --> 3832.02
dude you got a wound put it on a bandage

3830.28 --> 3835.02
I mean it's not gonna stop the bleeding

3832.02 --> 3837.359
at first right so that's different

3835.02 --> 3839.16
but as soon as you're like as soon as

3837.359 --> 3841.5
you can address some kind of healing

3839.16 --> 3845.2799999999997
process or preventing infection

3841.5 --> 3848.099
preventing gangrene hopefully

3845.28 --> 3850.38
silver colloidal silver put it on there

3848.099 --> 3852.78
it's gonna make everything heal much

3850.38 --> 3855.7200000000003
quicker

3852.78 --> 3859.44
it is naturally disinfectant

3855.72 --> 3862.3799999999997
and it lasts so you can actually have a

3859.44 --> 3865.2000000000003
colloidal silver doused bandage around

3862.38 --> 3868.4
the wound and then leave it like that

3865.2 --> 3868.3999999999996
much longer

3876.42 --> 3880.4
right and then drink some of it

3890.579 --> 3895.579
yeah that sucks Logan's Run but that

3892.559 --> 3895.579
typically did happen

3895.92 --> 3900.839
right you got a bad wound it's not they

3898.619 --> 3903.7200000000003
it's not taken care enough

3900.839 --> 3906.24
care off quickly enough

3903.72 --> 3907.2
and then you get gangrene it's really

3906.24 --> 3909.18
sucks

3907.2 --> 3911.5789999999997
well if you get there quick and you have

3909.18 --> 3913.44
colloidal silver available

3911.579 --> 3915.599
it's much more likely

3913.44 --> 3917.94
that you that you'll be able to prevent

3915.599 --> 3920.4
that

3917.94 --> 3922.92
from happening because yeah gangrene

3920.4 --> 3925.4
once it really hits It's fatal it's very

3922.92 --> 3925.4
dangerous

3953.819 --> 3960.599
yeah Ares 106 yeah

3957.18 --> 3963.5389999999998
but that was it's a crazy time but yeah

3960.599 --> 3966.119
that's where the saying comes from

3963.539 --> 3968.8190000000004
shooting yourself in the foot

3966.119 --> 3970.92
because soldiers in World War One

3968.819 --> 3972.839
they were just going like I don't want

3970.92 --> 3974.339
to do this anymore it's driving me

3972.839 --> 3976.859
insane

3974.339 --> 3980.64
just these disgusting trenches the smell

3976.859 --> 3982.0789999999997
of burnt blood and poison gas and just

3980.64 --> 3984.1189999999997
the horror

3982.079 --> 3986.579
they would shoot themselves in the foot

3984.119 --> 3988.2000000000003
so they would have medical leave yeah

3986.579 --> 3991.4
that's exactly what would happen that's

3988.2 --> 3991.3999999999996
where that saying came from

4011.299 --> 4013.839
hmm

4024.21 --> 4027.309
[Music]

4031.91 --> 4035.219
[Music]

4042.74 --> 4046.0589999999997
hey banjo bear

4047.78 --> 4050.26
hello

4072.3 --> 4075.3990000000003
[Music]

4079.339 --> 4082.299
hmm

4083.96 --> 4088.0
I think I can keep it peaceful today

4123.799 --> 4126.339
foreign

4133.779 --> 4141.6990000000005
man I've been doing some

4136.759 --> 4141.699
way more very basic weight lifting

4141.859 --> 4146.659000000001
I don't know what it is

4143.9 --> 4149.9
started doing that three days ago

4146.659 --> 4153.0199999999995
but it's crazy how quickly that works

4149.9 --> 4155.299
it really is crazy

4153.02 --> 4157.759
it grows like

4155.299 --> 4160.839
so fast

4157.759 --> 4160.839
this is surreal

4166.759 --> 4171.38
but I've always had that I think

4169.1 --> 4172.9400000000005
like I don't need like oh give them

4171.38 --> 4174.7390000000005
training I have to do it a month and

4172.94 --> 4177.8589999999995
then I'll see a result no it's just like

4174.739 --> 4180.459999999999
no I just do it two days and it's just

4177.859 --> 4180.46
like

4182.12 --> 4189.099999999999
it goes away again though but

4185.6 --> 4189.1
anyway what music do I enjoy

4189.56 --> 4194.02
that completely depends on my mood

4194.719 --> 4198.219
in the more recent days

4198.5 --> 4201.699
I'm more into classic

4204.26 --> 4209.4400000000005
I'll do my roommates think when I get a

4207.14 --> 4209.4400000000005
bit loud

4210.08 --> 4214.12
well it does make them nervous

4215.0 --> 4220.76
but I'm always friendly to them and I'm

4217.699 --> 4223.219
always like when I really think I went

4220.76 --> 4224.900000000001
like full-on berserk or something and

4223.219 --> 4227.3
got too loud

4224.9 --> 4229.159
and they'll be like oh hi I hope I

4227.3 --> 4231.320000000001
didn't bother you

4229.159 --> 4234.5599999999995
and they're usually like no yeah I heard

4231.32 --> 4237.38
something but it's not that bad

4234.56 --> 4241.280000000001
you know I am kind of like vocally

4237.38 --> 4243.679
tactical as in I know how to be able to

4241.28 --> 4246.62
express myself

4243.679 --> 4249.26
while being absolutely berserking mad

4246.62 --> 4250.4
without making too much noise at the

4249.26 --> 4253.46
same time

4250.4 --> 4255.799999999999
but yeah once I get going and I like

4253.46 --> 4257.719
can't stop doing it then it always goes

4255.8 --> 4259.400000000001
out of control eventually

4257.719 --> 4262.219
but there's all kinds of tactics of

4259.4 --> 4265.28
dealing with it that still makes me want

4262.219 --> 4267.44
to career and be really up close to the

4265.28 --> 4270.199
mic and and just you feel it you'll hear

4267.44 --> 4272.78
it and you'll see it but it won't be

4270.199 --> 4274.28
like boom through the building or

4272.78 --> 4277.639999999999
something right

4274.28 --> 4280.58
so usually I end up not

4277.64 --> 4282.56
being that much of a burden

4280.58 --> 4284.96
which by the way is a big Improvement

4282.56 --> 4286.46
compared to say five years ago four

4284.96 --> 4288.56
years ago

4286.46 --> 4292.52
when I did also get like a really

4288.56 --> 4295.76
savagely pissed off except not on camera

4292.52 --> 4299.4800000000005
and then like people then I would like

4295.76 --> 4301.34
just be way too loud and yeah some

4299.48 --> 4303.379999999999
people would actually like call the

4301.34 --> 4306.26
police because they thought somebody was

4303.38 --> 4308.36
getting beat up

4306.26 --> 4311.12
I guess what it was me pretty much

4308.36 --> 4313.699
beating myself up

4311.12 --> 4315.739
verbally

4313.699 --> 4317.239
buff win this is

4315.739 --> 4321.218999999999
anyway

4317.239 --> 4321.218999999999
in recent days I've been listening more

4321.739 --> 4326.239
classical music or rather that's the

4324.08 --> 4328.46
music that's now playing off in my head

4326.239 --> 4330.62
and it's it's really interesting too

4328.46 --> 4332.4800000000005
because it's the music from civilization

4330.62 --> 4334.82
five

4332.48 --> 4339.08
and

4334.82 --> 4341.78
uh I've played that game so long

4339.08 --> 4343.58
and have really grown fond of a lot of

4341.78 --> 4345.679
the songs that are in there

4343.58 --> 4348.28
and they're all like good classical

4345.679 --> 4348.28
music

4349.1 --> 4353.1990000000005
but

4350.239 --> 4356.599999999999
not even yeah it's not the Super

4353.199 --> 4358.5199999999995
overplayed tropes not the ones that

4356.6 --> 4360.4400000000005
everybody knows because that's not

4358.52 --> 4363.219
really interesting

4360.44 --> 4363.219
but it's like

4364.58 --> 4369.679
sort of familiar

4367.159 --> 4372.62
like it's very likely you'll have heard

4369.679 --> 4376.659
it at some point

4372.62 --> 4376.659
but it's pretty good music and

4379.58 --> 4384.679
yeah so I'm playing that game and then I

4382.46 --> 4386.42
end up kind of just playing the game for

4384.679 --> 4387.9800000000005
the music really because you're just

4386.42 --> 4392.12
listening to that music while you're

4387.98 --> 4395.419999999999
just doing strategy game management or

4392.12 --> 4397.64
like management game right

4395.42 --> 4399.32
and that's the music that's been going

4397.64 --> 4403.2390000000005
on in my head for a long time but other

4399.32 --> 4403.239
than that I have my times where

4403.719 --> 4410.719
I tend to listen to like Electro

4407.54 --> 4414.34
deep house style

4410.719 --> 4414.34
High electronic music

4418.46 --> 4420.94
and

4424.28 --> 4429.259999999999
yeah the thing with me and music is I

4426.679 --> 4431.6
always kind of forget everything and

4429.26 --> 4434.54
then I bump into it and it all relives

4431.6 --> 4436.64
again it's like the the bloom just

4434.54 --> 4439.3
starts over again it's like it's like

4436.64 --> 4439.3
it's new again

4441.739 --> 4446.178999999999
listening to music while nuking the

4443.84 --> 4447.62
world yeah it's ridiculous I never even

4446.179 --> 4452.06
get to that part

4447.62 --> 4453.8
do you know I always win the game now

4452.06 --> 4459.1
in

4453.8 --> 4464.4400000000005
it's hilarious like usually around 90 35

4459.1 --> 4464.4400000000005
90 42. I'm not even joking

4464.84 --> 4469.400000000001
so I never even get to nuking anybody

4467.12 --> 4473.78
I've already won the game it's just

4469.4 --> 4475.96
giant cultural Victory every time

4473.78 --> 4475.96
foreign

4497.08 --> 4502.239
Space Odyssey great soundtrack yeah

4499.52 --> 4502.2390000000005
pretty cool

4508.34 --> 4512.179
I love playing the late game

4510.26 --> 4516.38
civilization

4512.179 --> 4519.08
yeah well there's a civilization six and

4516.38 --> 4521.6
it sucks I've tried playing and I've

4519.08 --> 4524.42
even learned how it worked some of the

4521.6 --> 4525.9800000000005
thing is they put a lot of effort into

4524.42 --> 4529.04
the music

4525.98 --> 4533.718999999999
but they made it super catch

4529.04 --> 4536.659
it sucks sorry dude it really sucks

4533.719 --> 4538.64
there's like super

4536.659 --> 4541.639999999999
ugly things they do in that that's just

4538.64 --> 4544.34
like Ugh like when they do something

4541.64 --> 4546.62
that ugly with music it literally just

4544.34 --> 4549.02
makes me turn off the game immediately

4546.62 --> 4550.58
like it's so ugly I don't want to play

4549.02 --> 4554.360000000001
this game anymore

4550.58 --> 4557.48
just because of the music like [ __ ] you

4554.36 --> 4560.659
[ __ ] what you do that's terrible it's so

4557.48 --> 4562.639999999999
Kitsch it's so ugly never do that ever

4560.659 --> 4565.879999999999
again

4562.64 --> 4568.820000000001
never I mean it was a nice

4565.88 --> 4571.04
transition trick where they basically am

4568.82 --> 4573.679
take a basic theme started really simple

4571.04 --> 4576.32
they might get full then make it

4573.679 --> 4578.36
orchestral then make it bombastic super

4576.32 --> 4582.08
galactic

4578.36 --> 4584.12
it's [ __ ] up it's it's stupid it

4582.08 --> 4587.6
really gets tiresome listening to that

4584.12 --> 4590.48
wow civilization 5 it just has a whole

4587.6 --> 4592.58
set of different types of really good

4590.48 --> 4594.98
classical music

4592.58 --> 4597.44
and I don't get tired of it

4594.98 --> 4600.5599999999995
I can literally play the game for like

4597.44 --> 4602.839999999999
six hours straight and I don't get tired

4600.56 --> 4604.9400000000005
of the music I mean I don't like all the

4602.84 --> 4608.08
songs that are in there some are kind of

4604.94 --> 4611.9
annoying so like this weird Grappler

4608.08 --> 4614.659
complainy pants victim mentality song

4611.9 --> 4617.96
the violin or screechie that's annoying

4614.659 --> 4620.659
right but at least it was still like

4617.96 --> 4623.0
made well

4620.659 --> 4624.04
it was a serious composition no [ __ ]

4623.0 --> 4628.219
around

4624.04 --> 4632.12
and yeah a lot of it is like really good

4628.219 --> 4633.56
like the Ring of nibalungan style

4632.12 --> 4636.679
awesome

4633.56 --> 4638.3
music civilization five has an amazing

4636.679 --> 4639.7390000000005
soundtrack civilization through I don't

4638.3 --> 4641.6
know I've I don't remember this

4639.739 --> 4644.12
soundtrack I just know civilization

4641.6 --> 4646.659000000001
fight is just full-on

4644.12 --> 4646.659
like

4648.199 --> 4656.259999999999
room recorded classical music like

4651.92 --> 4656.26
Sirius up yeah what do you call that

4656.84 --> 4662.96
not Opera Style

4659.42 --> 4666.26
this full Orchestra it's really good

4662.96 --> 4668.84
I have not heard any other civilization

4666.26 --> 4669.92
game music that was like all that but

4668.84 --> 4672.52
that's better

4669.92 --> 4672.52
no

4678.32 --> 4682.639999999999
and I remember civilization for had a

4680.78 --> 4685.099999999999
kind of amusing soundtrack they had

4682.64 --> 4688.46
interesting stuff and especially

4685.1 --> 4690.7390000000005
interesting Medieval music and when I

4688.46 --> 4692.42
started playing some civilization five I

4690.739 --> 4695.36
started to miss

4692.42 --> 4697.6
the Medieval music from civilization 4

4695.36 --> 4701.86
because they had like the real

4697.6 --> 4701.860000000001
old-fashioned choir boy type

4702.46 --> 4707.78
Medieval music and it was really well

4705.56 --> 4710.42
executed so I missed that in

4707.78 --> 4712.3
Civilization 5 but civilization 5 just

4710.42 --> 4716.78
has like the best

4712.3 --> 4719.54
Industrial Age classical music there is

4716.78 --> 4722.32
the best of it I really like it it

4719.54 --> 4722.32
doesn't Tire me

4723.5 --> 4727.699
civilization three I don't I don't think

4725.78 --> 4729.38
I've ever played I played civilization

4727.699 --> 4734.44
one though

4729.38 --> 4734.4400000000005
yeah on my Amiga 1200.

4734.54 --> 4737.62
that was hilarious

4747.679 --> 4754.0
anyway that's yeah

4750.5 --> 4754.0
that's a game I really like

4754.34 --> 4759.02
but I've mastered it so much that it's I

4757.46 --> 4761.06
don't even have to use my cognition

4759.02 --> 4765.280000000001
anymore to play it it's just I know

4761.06 --> 4765.280000000001
exactly how everything works every time

4765.32 --> 4769.219
there's like no more surprises that can

4767.42 --> 4772.9400000000005
really happen because I must have played

4769.219 --> 4775.34
it through to a win

4772.94 --> 4777.799999999999
like over a thousand times or so it's

4775.34 --> 4781.28
terrible I've played it way too much but

4777.8 --> 4782.96
it's yeah it's a good

4781.28 --> 4785.0599999999995
way to escape

4782.96 --> 4787.58
that's a good way to mellow out

4785.06 --> 4790.06
and I and it's just good music I like

4787.58 --> 4790.0599999999995
the music

4791.06 --> 4795.56
also that music also helps me think

4793.699 --> 4799.159
about the past

4795.56 --> 4803.179
right I constantly use the game

4799.159 --> 4805.04
to try to reconstruct in my mind how

4803.179 --> 4807.5
past events would have gone especially

4805.04 --> 4810.0199999999995
the mentality

4807.5 --> 4812.719
every time

4810.02 --> 4814.400000000001
throughout my life everybody always when

4812.719 --> 4816.679
they thought back about the past it's

4814.4 --> 4818.839999999999
always but though it's older they were

4816.679 --> 4822.4400000000005
not as wise yet they didn't have all

4818.84 --> 4825.139
this and that it was also misunderstood

4822.44 --> 4828.799999999999
and like playing the game

4825.139 --> 4831.86
I'm like fully perfected tactician and

4828.8 --> 4834.679
what I do I want full development

4831.86 --> 4837.259999999999
and then just realizing like what I'm

4834.679 --> 4838.34
accomplishing in the game it's like yeah

4837.26 --> 4841.400000000001
but

4838.34 --> 4843.1990000000005
the ancient would have have been in

4841.4 --> 4844.82
those types of positions too they

4843.199 --> 4847.12
wouldn't have just been screwing around

4844.82 --> 4850.28
like retards no they would have

4847.12 --> 4852.38
absolutely done everything optimal

4850.28 --> 4855.62
and it's just been lost to history or

4852.38 --> 4858.5
hidden hidden from history

4855.62 --> 4861.199
so when I play the game I think about

4858.5 --> 4862.88
are the past a lot

4861.199 --> 4865.879999999999
at the same time

4862.88 --> 4868.1
with the music and and the music is its

4865.88 --> 4870.1990000000005
own manipulation in its own way and I'm

4868.1 --> 4872.719
trying to figure out that

4870.199 --> 4874.58
it's like this music is really made it's

4872.719 --> 4877.4
not something that was written

4874.58 --> 4879.32
specifically for the game I think

4877.4 --> 4882.32
sure though I don't think so I think it

4879.32 --> 4884.239
was like original classical music

4882.32 --> 4887.239
so

4884.239 --> 4889.4
when was that written why to what

4887.239 --> 4891.638999999999
audience was that catering

4889.4 --> 4894.5599999999995
I think about all those things

4891.639 --> 4896.42
constantly when I'm playing the game

4894.56 --> 4899.8
constantly

4896.42 --> 4899.8
dreaming sorry

4900.26 --> 4903.9800000000005
yeah

4902.239 --> 4906.08
anyway

4903.98 --> 4909.159
so yeah that's the music that I listen

4906.08 --> 4909.159
to right now

4932.0 --> 4936.5
I think that banjo bear is gone again

4935.06 --> 4939.76
hope he didn't

4936.5 --> 4939.76
get snowed under

4945.26 --> 4950.139
pretty weird though that it snowed in

4947.96 --> 4950.139
Austin

4952.46 --> 4957.26
played Civilization Revolution no I

4954.92 --> 4959.4800000000005
don't know what that is

4957.26 --> 4961.780000000001
that some newer version or is an older

4959.48 --> 4961.78
version

4962.48 --> 4964.659
foreign

4967.94 --> 4970.94
cool

4985.219 --> 4990.46
oh hello by the way new Constantino good

4988.1 --> 4990.46
to see you

5001.96 --> 5004.139
foreign

5032.26 --> 5035.04
hmm

5043.9 --> 5048.659
right yeah John Levin it's that's crazy

5049.12 --> 5054.219
but it shouldn't be too much of a

5051.28 --> 5056.679
problem if just the

5054.219 --> 5058.2390000000005
well if there's enough gas and

5056.679 --> 5061.06
electricity

5058.239 --> 5063.459999999999
to go around right but I've been hearing

5061.06 --> 5065.7390000000005
a lot that

5063.46 --> 5068.44
that those are being cut off and [ __ ]

5065.739 --> 5071.5
that's the real problem

5068.44 --> 5075.879999999999
so technically Austin not made for snow

5071.5 --> 5078.1
perhaps but if it would just

5075.88 --> 5081.04
be left to

5078.1 --> 5085.08
be able to use the resources to combat

5081.04 --> 5085.08
it it shouldn't be too much of a problem

5087.52 --> 5094.84
it's a massive homeless popular really

5091.12 --> 5094.84
in Austin huh

5127.9 --> 5131.58
no water wow

5170.26 --> 5173.219
okay

5201.1 --> 5206.679
and companies actually put effort in

5203.38 --> 5208.8
making quality game well that's you can

5206.679 --> 5213.1
actually

5208.8 --> 5215.679
retrace exactly how that works right

5213.1 --> 5218.320000000001
when does a company make a great game

5215.679 --> 5221.34
and when does the same company make a

5218.32 --> 5221.34
super sucky game

5221.98 --> 5226.54
they make a great game is when they have

5224.02 --> 5228.4800000000005
a really good game concept and then they

5226.54 --> 5230.92
spend all the time

5228.48 --> 5235.239
perfecting it

5230.92 --> 5239.139
just working around that concept

5235.239 --> 5241.659
and letting that concept be great

5239.139 --> 5244.900000000001
and making it the primary target to

5241.659 --> 5247.0599999999995
uphold that part that is great about the

5244.9 --> 5250.78
game and perfecting that right the

5247.06 --> 5254.02
updates or like whatever add-ons

5250.78 --> 5256.54
that's how you get a really great game

5254.02 --> 5261.9400000000005
when they make a sucky game you

5256.54 --> 5265.48
immediately know by them just trying to

5261.94 --> 5269.08
adapt to successful formula to something

5265.48 --> 5272.62
else oh like to a new console to a new

5269.08 --> 5277.0
thing to a new format

5272.62 --> 5280.659
that's when it sucks like really really

5277.0 --> 5282.82
sucks it's like oh we have to adapt away

5280.659 --> 5286.78
from perfection

5282.82 --> 5288.699
to try to just trying something else and

5286.78 --> 5290.679
then it's all screwed up and then

5288.699 --> 5292.719
everybody's like this sucks

5290.679 --> 5294.04
this is worse than the previous one why

5292.719 --> 5296.5
did you do that

5294.04 --> 5300.4
yeah because they were just trying to

5296.5 --> 5303.159
adapt it to some other things

5300.4 --> 5305.739
it becomes like a an advertisement

5303.159 --> 5307.54
commercial operation instead of just

5305.739 --> 5310.9
perfecting

5307.54 --> 5313.12
what makes a certain game a closed loop

5310.9 --> 5314.86
Perfection a great thing

5313.12 --> 5317.0199999999995
they move away from that and they're

5314.86 --> 5320.38
just adapting it to something and then

5317.02 --> 5322.900000000001
it always sucks every time it's not even

5320.38 --> 5324.9400000000005
games it's even operating systems

5322.9 --> 5327.94
everything

5324.94 --> 5330.638999999999
programmers should make one

5327.94 --> 5333.5199999999995
focused effort

5330.639 --> 5336.52
build around a concept and then

5333.52 --> 5338.580000000001
perfecting that concept and then [ __ ]

5336.52 --> 5341.38
everything else [ __ ]

5338.58 --> 5344.679
advertisement [ __ ] adaptability just

5341.38 --> 5346.2390000000005
make it perfect and screw them like it

5344.679 --> 5348.159
doesn't matter as long as the game is

5346.239 --> 5350.5
perfect because everybody will love it

5348.159 --> 5353.32
forever

5350.5 --> 5355.9
right it will be an example a reminder

5353.32 --> 5359.44
of how things can be good

5355.9 --> 5361.719
right that's how good games are made by

5359.44 --> 5364.48
programmers saying yeah screw you

5361.719 --> 5369.0
corporate we don't give a [ __ ] we're

5364.48 --> 5369.0
gonna make this game perfect right

5370.96 --> 5376.199
and that's those are the games that we

5373.54 --> 5376.199
love to remember

5377.8 --> 5383.92
because they were made around perfecting

5380.56 --> 5387.1
the concept that made it a great game

5383.92 --> 5390.46
they were not just trying to adapt to

5387.1 --> 5394.42
something else or misfocusing them like

5390.46 --> 5396.28
oh we gotta like it's a typical game

5394.42 --> 5398.5
series that would be made on good

5396.28 --> 5401.5
stories and then they're like oh no but

5398.5 --> 5404.26
we gotta adapt to the latest Graphics oh

5401.5 --> 5408.04
it's so important yeah

5404.26 --> 5412.659000000001
like for example Baldur's Gate 3. which

5408.04 --> 5415.84
sucks I'm sorry guys it sucks

5412.659 --> 5419.0199999999995
so really cool engine and blah blah blah

5415.84 --> 5422.62
it has absolutely nothing to do with

5419.02 --> 5426.4800000000005
Baldur's Gate one and two nothing

5422.62 --> 5426.48
it's not even a complete game

5426.52 --> 5433.3
it's oh look at the new engine it's so

5429.28 --> 5438.219
important 3D now [ __ ] you why didn't you

5433.3 --> 5441.04
just use the old 20 year old format ways

5438.219 --> 5442.719
of doing things which is what made that

5441.04 --> 5445.179
game perfect

5442.719 --> 5448.36
it's like still perfect right now

5445.179 --> 5450.76
because of its Simplicity it always runs

5448.36 --> 5452.86
it never errors there's no shitty

5450.76 --> 5455.08
updates you need

5452.86 --> 5459.4
once you realize that people are just

5455.08 --> 5462.46
sick of this stupid new formatting like

5459.4 --> 5465.46
[ __ ] the formatting just make the game

5462.46 --> 5468.28
good make the story good have good voice

5465.46 --> 5470.62
actors that are actually driven have a

5468.28 --> 5472.12
coherent good story that was actually

5470.62 --> 5474.76
thought about

5472.12 --> 5478.96
and not just scrape together with some

5474.76 --> 5481.06
random character generator [ __ ]

5478.96 --> 5483.76
so lazy

5481.06 --> 5486.159000000001
nowadays it's all so lazy there's no

5483.76 --> 5489.52
more of real spiritual

5486.159 --> 5492.46
serious Spirit to this to the games to

5489.52 --> 5495.52
these are RPG games

5492.46 --> 5497.9800000000005
Boulders Gate 3 is an embarrassment

5495.52 --> 5501.9400000000005
compared to Baldur's Gate one and two it

5497.98 --> 5504.04
is an embarrassment it's still an okay

5501.94 --> 5505.9
game I guess

5504.04 --> 5509.1
sorta

5505.9 --> 5509.099999999999
not really though

5510.76 --> 5517.719
because they abandoned what made the

5514.48 --> 5522.638999999999
actual Baldur's Gate games great

5517.719 --> 5526.4800000000005
story actual story drive a focus a story

5522.639 --> 5530.62
drive for the player to latch onto

5526.48 --> 5533.58
instead they turn it into like

5530.62 --> 5533.58
it's gaming

5533.679 --> 5537.88
it turned it into like a more Dragon Age

5536.32 --> 5539.799999999999
thing

5537.88 --> 5541.84
it's like yeah it's a pretty good game

5539.8 --> 5544.860000000001
yeah it's not [ __ ] Baldur's Gate

5541.84 --> 5544.860000000001
though ass

5548.04 --> 5554.38
all right

5550.9 --> 5556.9
and your music is not good I mean it's

5554.38 --> 5559.6
okay it's just not as good as the old

5556.9 --> 5561.96
Baldur's Gate which there was like a

5559.6 --> 5565.900000000001
distinct

5561.96 --> 5568.5
really really playing on the feelings

5565.9 --> 5571.659
and on nervousness and on just this

5568.5 --> 5574.42
visual music music that would literally

5571.659 --> 5577.839999999999
make you imagine [ __ ] happening around

5574.42 --> 5580.42
you yeah that's real Baldur's Gate music

5577.84 --> 5581.9800000000005
they didn't do that

5580.42 --> 5585.42
it's not

5581.98 --> 5585.419999999999
it's just not the same

5587.199 --> 5591.46
yeah ball is good now there's a good

5588.94 --> 5593.919999999999
game because they perfected it they

5591.46 --> 5596.679
perfected that thing

5593.92 --> 5598.96
that was created in the 90s and they

5596.679 --> 5601.2390000000005
perfected it they made like the best

5598.96 --> 5604.54
possible thing the best possible

5601.239 --> 5605.739
Arrangement best possible music you can

5604.54 --> 5609.699
make

5605.739 --> 5612.12
with that format and they did it really

5609.699 --> 5612.12
well

5621.159 --> 5626.44
everyone wants to be wow yeah wow sucks

5624.52 --> 5630.400000000001
it's lame

5626.44 --> 5632.5
it's dumb is it Goofy oh yeah it's a lot

5630.4 --> 5635.44
of fun being around yeah if you're a

5632.5 --> 5637.78
[ __ ] [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm sorry did I

5635.44 --> 5641.62
insult anybody oh

5637.78 --> 5643.78
yeah I'm sorry it's just dumb

5641.62 --> 5646.0599999999995
I mean it's kind of fun if you're like

5643.78 --> 5649.0599999999995
oh yeah I want to play that but it's not

5646.06 --> 5651.400000000001
really that good a game

5649.06 --> 5653.139
I mean there's a lot of Maintenance a

5651.4 --> 5657.219
lot of things and energy and money

5653.139 --> 5659.26
poured into it to keep it like up the

5657.219 --> 5664.9800000000005
standard sure

5659.26 --> 5664.9800000000005
but overall it's not like woo man

5665.32 --> 5670.78
like just think about it like this

5668.5 --> 5673.12
people start to play World of Warcraft

5670.78 --> 5675.82
they have

5673.12 --> 5678.219
then they get really fanatic then

5675.82 --> 5681.46
eventually they kind of stop

5678.219 --> 5683.679
yeah do they ever go back

5681.46 --> 5684.82
do they ever actually want to go back

5683.679 --> 5686.4400000000005
playing

5684.82 --> 5688.659
no they don't

5686.44 --> 5691.239
they usually don't unless their life

5688.659 --> 5693.879999999999
goes to full [ __ ] and they need a

5691.239 --> 5695.919999999999
desperate Escape away from the [ __ ] that

5693.88 --> 5699.6990000000005
they've ended up with in their life and

5695.92 --> 5702.52
then they might just dive back in right

5699.699 --> 5703.98
you have to be that miserable to start

5702.52 --> 5706.2390000000005
playing it again

5703.98 --> 5709.119
I'm sorry

5706.239 --> 5711.159
I'm sorry that's reality

5709.119 --> 5713.679
it's not that good a game

5711.159 --> 5717.759999999999
and it's [ __ ] ugly by the way I think

5713.679 --> 5720.34
it's ugh disgusting cartoonish ugly I

5717.76 --> 5721.84
hate this style but that's a style issue

5720.34 --> 5724.32
I don't like it

5721.84 --> 5728.38
it's not a good game to

5724.32 --> 5731.08
keep coming back to however Baldur's

5728.38 --> 5734.679
Gate Baldur's Gate 2

5731.08 --> 5736.9
I've played through those games

5734.679 --> 5739.54
so many times

5736.9 --> 5741.58
and I would actually enjoy the story I

5739.54 --> 5744.46
would enjoy the music I would still

5741.58 --> 5748.42
enjoy the tension it's like

5744.46 --> 5751.659
it's like an actual piece of theater

5748.42 --> 5753.52
in a basic computer game and it works

5751.659 --> 5755.259999999999
every time it's like I'm going to the

5753.52 --> 5757.42
Opera

5755.26 --> 5760.54
knowing what to expect but still it's

5757.42 --> 5763.96
like yeah man it's still impressive

5760.54 --> 5767.0199999999995
and it's super old

5763.96 --> 5770.92
and it works really well it still works

5767.02 --> 5772.119000000001
yeah World of Warcraft dude gets so

5770.92 --> 5774.4
tedious

5772.119 --> 5776.44
and what are you even doing in World of

5774.4 --> 5779.199
Warcraft grinding

5776.44 --> 5781.178999999999
doing the same stupid action over and

5779.199 --> 5783.699
over and over again and that's a game

5781.179 --> 5785.92
that's Amusement dude why don't you just

5783.699 --> 5788.98
get a job in some Factory or something

5785.92 --> 5791.08
you'll be doing exactly that just doing

5788.98 --> 5793.718999999999
the same stupid thing over and over

5791.08 --> 5795.699
again and guess what you get actual

5793.719 --> 5798.699
money doing that

5795.699 --> 5801.46
I mean you could be on an assembly line

5798.699 --> 5804.159
working doing the same stupid thing over

5801.46 --> 5806.08
and over and over again constantly and

5804.159 --> 5810.099999999999
actually get money out of it

5806.08 --> 5814.9
why don't you do that instead of paying

5810.1 --> 5817.2390000000005
on a monthly basis to do stupid grinding

5814.9 --> 5821.82
for hours

5817.239 --> 5821.82
that doesn't even give you anything real

5822.46 --> 5828.719
I mean

5824.46 --> 5828.719
seriously think about that

5830.739 --> 5833.5199999999995
you know

5836.18 --> 5839.2390000000005
[Music]

5844.99 --> 5848.438999999999
[Music]

5873.1 --> 5879.06
yeah yeah battle toads that was a tough

5875.44 --> 5879.0599999999995
one I've played it a couple of times

5879.219 --> 5884.92
but uh not for too long oh ghosts and

5881.98 --> 5887.799999999999
goblins whoo

5884.92 --> 5890.08
Ghouls and ghosts too like I played

5887.8 --> 5893.02
those on my commodore 64.

5890.08 --> 5896.08
and that that was just like really

5893.02 --> 5900.3
intense spooky music

5896.08 --> 5900.3
for a freaking commodore 64.

5906.4 --> 5911.5
and like yeah

5908.739 --> 5913.239
that game is so tough like even if you

5911.5 --> 5914.739
had like infinite lives then good

5913.239 --> 5917.678999999999
[ __ ] luck

5914.739 --> 5919.54
still almost impossible to just play it

5917.679 --> 5922.1990000000005
through

5919.54 --> 5922.199
uh

5935.04 --> 5940.96
I heard all those poor wow nerds

5938.32 --> 5942.82
feelings just then yeah I did but I did

5940.96 --> 5946.0
it for a good reason

5942.82 --> 5948.82
I mean I'm not telling you oh my God you

5946.0 --> 5950.02
should never do that ever I'm just

5948.82 --> 5953.739
saying

5950.02 --> 5956.4400000000005
if you find yourself just wasting hours

5953.739 --> 5960.04
and hours on grinding something stupid

5956.44 --> 5963.339999999999
to get some virtual little thing

5960.04 --> 5966.82
so you get a plus two bonus on something

5963.34 --> 5969.639
right you spend hours and hours like is

5966.82 --> 5972.88
that really worth it

5969.639 --> 5976.119
I mean you could just like get a job at

5972.88 --> 5980.139
an assembly line and doing that

5976.119 --> 5982.96
and you'll actually get money out of it

5980.139 --> 5985.3
I mean if that amuses you then why don't

5982.96 --> 5987.159
you get a job at an assembly line I mean

5985.3 --> 5990.04
you could do it this is actually a real

5987.159 --> 5991.659
recommendation it's not be being snarky

5990.04 --> 5994.06
serious

5991.659 --> 5997.42
I'm not telling you don't never play

5994.06 --> 6000.8
well I'm just saying I don't like it I

5997.42 --> 6000.8
think personally it's ugly

6000.96 --> 6006.2390000000005
and I don't know anybody that like

6004.5 --> 6008.94
stopped playing it eventually that's

6006.239 --> 6011.218999999999
like oh man I gotta go back to wow I

6008.94 --> 6013.919999999999
mean they might have like nostalgic days

6011.219 --> 6015.659
to when like oh the guys got together we

6013.92 --> 6018.659
were all on the

6015.659 --> 6020.82
on the what is it the voice call thing

6018.659 --> 6023.219
and yeah that was kind of cool back then

6020.82 --> 6027.739
right yeah sure

6023.219 --> 6027.7390000000005
that that looked exciting right

6028.739 --> 6033.959999999999
but if you find yourself just constantly

6032.159 --> 6036.78
grinding and wasting a lot of time in

6033.96 --> 6039.26
that game dude that's not worth it and

6036.78 --> 6039.259999999999
yeah

6048.42 --> 6052.679
right Reno yeah wow is addictive because

6050.52 --> 6055.4400000000005
of the people it makes the game yeah but

6052.679 --> 6058.34
eventually the people get lives

6055.44 --> 6058.339999999999
and they should

6069.739 --> 6076.138999999999
right and I had the same experience with

6073.44 --> 6078.9
other online games that were like even

6076.139 --> 6080.88
shittier that just like really much

6078.9 --> 6083.879999999999
shittier cheaper

6080.88 --> 6086.1
those were free to play

6083.88 --> 6088.08
but they were always offering you to

6086.1 --> 6089.46
waste your money on some virtual things

6088.08 --> 6094.0199999999995
you could get

6089.46 --> 6096.179
but in those games yeah I played it

6094.02 --> 6098.1
because I knew other people that were

6096.179 --> 6100.08
playing it I actually knew them in

6098.1 --> 6102.96
person

6100.08 --> 6105.0
this one girl I met there I actually

6102.96 --> 6106.44
thought she was kind of a I still have

6105.0 --> 6109.26
her on Skype

6106.44 --> 6111.678999999999
she actually sent me some photos normal

6109.26 --> 6111.679
photos

6112.5 --> 6117.239
I was actually thinking of dating her at

6114.719 --> 6120.6
the time meeting her through such a

6117.239 --> 6123.0
online game thing like that nobody knows

6120.6 --> 6125.159000000001
about nobody should know about

6123.0 --> 6127.739
right but it's the people that play it

6125.159 --> 6130.44
but eventually you grow up you grow out

6127.739 --> 6133.678999999999
of it and you should

6130.44 --> 6135.659
n't try to hold on to that

6133.679 --> 6138.54
it's just gonna suck you dry and make

6135.659 --> 6141.299999999999
you super anti-social super socially

6138.54 --> 6144.139
anxious you don't want that you want to

6141.3 --> 6144.139
don't want to go there

6152.219 --> 6159.719
ghosts and goblins give me PTSD

6155.54 --> 6162.179
yeah yeah me too

6159.719 --> 6164.4
God that was so tense

6162.179 --> 6167.76
like some of those parts are so hard

6164.4 --> 6171.259999999999
it's like so tense you're like oh my God

6167.76 --> 6171.26
can I make it this time

6172.28 --> 6179.0
yeah that's like the old hard games from

6175.679 --> 6179.0
the 80s and the 90s

6192.36 --> 6196.4
right anyway I'm gonna take a two minute

6194.04 --> 6196.4
break

6197.84 --> 6202.139
and they'll be right back there's no

6199.92 --> 6204.9800000000005
Life Flat Earth debate so I'll just keep

6202.139 --> 6204.9800000000005
on going for now

6298.5 --> 6302.659
yeah

6300.48 --> 6302.659
foreign

6320.4 --> 6324.5
yeah Johnny M I had blocked everybody

6324.78 --> 6332.0599999999995
don't worry I can still block you if you

6327.42 --> 6332.06
choose to act like a troll again

6380.159 --> 6384.739
potentially making games hard as a risky

6382.619 --> 6384.739
move

6388.02 --> 6390.659000000001
foreign

6388.86 --> 6393.719
doesn't generate a lot of money since

6390.659 --> 6396.0599999999995
not many will play well yeah that's the

6393.719 --> 6398.1
but it's because of the gaming slaves

6396.06 --> 6400.1990000000005
right

6398.1 --> 6403.860000000001
because of people

6400.199 --> 6405.78
that are so full on into escapism they

6403.86 --> 6408.0
just want the next game immediately

6405.78 --> 6410.159
immediately right it didn't used to be

6408.0 --> 6412.86
like that

6410.159 --> 6416.339999999999
right in the 90s it did it really didn't

6412.86 --> 6419.159
it didn't used to be like that

6416.34 --> 6421.5
people would play a game

6419.159 --> 6424.379999999999
and then they would like yeah this is my

6421.5 --> 6426.84
game this is the one I'm gonna play now

6424.38 --> 6429.2390000000005
and then until you yeah

6426.84 --> 6430.9800000000005
you perfected it or you're like I can't

6429.239 --> 6433.619
get Beyond this point

6430.98 --> 6435.48
just have to stop and then

6433.619 --> 6438.119
you might check out okay another game

6435.48 --> 6440.94
right

6438.119 --> 6443.88
but nowadays it's like oh I just won the

6440.94 --> 6446.5199999999995
next game and oh like in the middle of

6443.88 --> 6448.679
the game they just forget about it and

6446.52 --> 6450.6
then it's all another game they just

6448.679 --> 6453.139
from one game to another and they become

6450.6 --> 6453.139
lazy

6453.719 --> 6458.36
because it's already being tend to

6460.5 --> 6465.48
their laziness and that's terrible they

6462.719 --> 6468.659
should just make it really hard

6465.48 --> 6470.5199999999995
but not complicated heart just difficult

6468.659 --> 6474.739
hard like

6470.52 --> 6474.7390000000005
you actually have to like

6476.34 --> 6482.159000000001
be for yeah good in reflexes and all

6479.34 --> 6483.92
that and Etc and Etc and

6482.159 --> 6485.759999999999
like

6483.92 --> 6489.179
memorize

6485.76 --> 6492.42
certain ways of doing things right

6489.179 --> 6495.84
most old games were hard until you

6492.42 --> 6497.639
memorized how to do the routine and then

6495.84 --> 6501.179
you would just go through to click click

6497.639 --> 6503.639
click very easily

6501.179 --> 6505.86
well not easily you worked hard to get

6503.639 --> 6507.4800000000005
to that point and then it would be very

6505.86 --> 6509.94
satisfying that now it's very easy

6507.48 --> 6512.5199999999995
you're an expert at that maneuver

6509.94 --> 6515.599999999999
but newer games don't really seem to

6512.52 --> 6515.6
work like that anymore

6515.88 --> 6521.06
it's all automated it's all to filled in

6532.619 --> 6538.739
we played Black Ops dude I've plain

6535.26 --> 6540.96
played plenty of like Shooters and

6538.739 --> 6543.299999999999
well not even that much

6540.96 --> 6546.659
and I just played Counter-Strike a whole

6543.3 --> 6549.84
bunch back in the day

6546.659 --> 6552.739
with other people massive land networks

6549.84 --> 6552.7390000000005
at school

6552.84 --> 6557.119000000001
during classes so whatever

6557.4 --> 6561.42
just like in that South Park episode

6559.199 --> 6563.5199999999995
where they do that one time it's exactly

6561.42 --> 6565.32
like what I experienced exactly that

6563.52 --> 6568.320000000001
except not

6565.32 --> 6571.44
in like as a six-year-old or anything or

6568.32 --> 6574.619
an eight-year-old but much later

6571.44 --> 6577.678999999999
but yeah I've I've stepped away from all

6574.619 --> 6580.44
those Shooters I don't play them anymore

6577.679 --> 6583.08
like at all never I don't like him

6580.44 --> 6587.299999999999
anymore like they piss me off

6583.08 --> 6587.3
they literally annoy me now

6588.54 --> 6593.28
because I get nauseated

6591.119 --> 6596.759999999999
and I don't like it I don't like doing

6593.28 --> 6600.78
that it it doesn't do it for me anymore

6596.76 --> 6603.179
it doesn't provide a actual suspense of

6600.78 --> 6605.699
disbelief or some kind of a Revenge

6603.179 --> 6608.4
situation fantasy it doesn't work

6605.699 --> 6610.5
anymore I don't want to do that I don't

6608.4 --> 6614.42
even want to virtually start shooting

6610.5 --> 6614.42
like that I don't want to do it anymore

6620.34 --> 6625.139
right because I'm starting to recognize

6623.34 --> 6628.56
as I've grown older

6625.139 --> 6632.4800000000005
that whatever you fantasize about it's

6628.56 --> 6632.4800000000005
just as real as the real world

6633.78 --> 6639.78
you're still subjecting yourself to that

6636.54 --> 6643.08
even though it's fantasy

6639.78 --> 6645.38
your spirit will still take it as real

6643.08 --> 6648.9
it's still gonna

6645.38 --> 6651.900000000001
be what you act it isn't it's still

6648.9 --> 6654.36
gonna do that to you

6651.9 --> 6657.839999999999
it's still going to harden you up

6654.36 --> 6659.82
it's still going to make you apathetic

6657.84 --> 6662.76
it does that's what those types of games

6659.82 --> 6665.58
do and I don't want to play it anymore

6662.76 --> 6669.84
I see it now and it's not fun to me

6665.58 --> 6673.26
anymore it doesn't amuse me doing that

6669.84 --> 6675.360000000001
now what does amuse me is organization

6673.26 --> 6677.639
and building games

6675.36 --> 6679.32
right and if I have to defend the

6677.639 --> 6683.0
building or something sure that's why

6679.32 --> 6683.0
strategy games do work for me

6683.219 --> 6688.199
because there I can still trick myself

6685.739 --> 6690.419999999999
as I am building something even though I

6688.199 --> 6692.46
know in reality I'm not building it but

6690.42 --> 6695.219
I'm just I'm trying to understand the

6692.46 --> 6697.8
development process that's a simulation

6695.219 --> 6702.2390000000005
it's a skeleton like simulation of

6697.8 --> 6705.179
building and then my defense instincts

6702.239 --> 6707.879999999999
to protect what I've built so it's much

6705.179 --> 6711.9
more rewarding to me and much less

6707.88 --> 6714.9800000000005
morally object objectionable

6711.9 --> 6714.98
than shooters

6725.699 --> 6730.32
wouldn't that be hilarious by the way

6727.679 --> 6733.08
playing like a strategy game

6730.32 --> 6734.82
like like a war strategy game and then

6733.08 --> 6736.5599999999995
you're like building up this and that

6734.82 --> 6739.58
and then like yeah I'm gonna make a

6736.56 --> 6739.580000000001
peace treaty with you

6741.26 --> 6746.88
so yeah that's peace

6744.659 --> 6750.739
isn't that that's just silly isn't it

6746.88 --> 6750.7390000000005
but it would be really funny

6781.86 --> 6786.239
Age of Empires yeah yeah I've played

6784.44 --> 6788.94
well I actually played a lot of Age of

6786.239 --> 6789.959999999999
Empires 3 with my ax we would both play

6788.94 --> 6794.96
that

6789.96 --> 6794.96
in cooperation mode it was epic

6797.159 --> 6801.44
I would always be better though but yeah

6802.199 --> 6807.86
that's because I I have less of a life

6816.179 --> 6820.9400000000005
Mortal Kombat was really exciting at the

6818.76 --> 6820.9400000000005
time

6825.42 --> 6829.92
but yeah beat him up games and all that

6829.08 --> 6833.4
foreign

6829.92 --> 6836.3
I mean they're pretty cool I guess

6833.4 --> 6836.299999999999
it's just

6838.679 --> 6841.4
nah

6842.76 --> 6848.76
I haven't played any like beat em up or

6845.219 --> 6852.5
yeah what is it one-on-one combat type

6848.76 --> 6852.5
of games in a long long time

6898.199 --> 6902.699
okay this is getting kind of lame now

6900.42 --> 6905.06
I'm I'm going to stop talking about

6902.699 --> 6905.0599999999995
games

6907.5 --> 6912.739
they weren't that great

6910.199 --> 6912.739
really

6941.76 --> 6946.159000000001
whoever had it coming to 64. yeah me

6946.739 --> 6952.5599999999995
my Commodore 64 and like 2 000 floppy

6950.639 --> 6955.9800000000005
disks

6952.56 --> 6959.719
I got through half of it

6955.98 --> 6959.718999999999
didn't even know what was on the rest

6963.3 --> 6968.04
I did spend like insane amounts of time

6965.94 --> 6969.719
though

6968.04 --> 6972.0
especially unlike boulder dash

6969.719 --> 6974.639
construction kit where I made like 20

6972.0 --> 6978.599
levels 26.

6974.639 --> 6981.3
like really heavy puzzle levels I'm so

6978.599 --> 6984.84
sad that I've lost that like because

6981.3 --> 6989.0
that was great work like I really made

6984.84 --> 6989.0
really complicated puzzles

6989.76 --> 6996.54
it was epic it inspired me to actually

6993.3 --> 6999.679
make like a new boulder dash game that I

6996.54 --> 6999.679
still have the designs of

7000.199 --> 7004.5199999999995
like a Super Bowl the dash with instead

7003.619 --> 7007.82
of

7004.52 --> 7010.119000000001
16 different base blocks that you that

7007.82 --> 7014.119
the game is comprised of

7010.119 --> 7017.179
256 different blocks

7014.119 --> 7021.28
I still have the blueprints it's like

7017.179 --> 7021.28
it's ready to program pretty much

7023.48 --> 7027.5199999999995
I think I showed it on the show one time

7030.02 --> 7035.26
you had an Amiga yeah Amiga 1200 too

7040.28 --> 7045.5599999999995
that's where where my background picture

7042.8 --> 7047.719
from my desktop is from

7045.56 --> 7051.4400000000005
and Rocket Z

7047.719 --> 7054.02
like really beautiful game and like

7051.44 --> 7057.86
player on player game

7054.02 --> 7060.139
I was so insanely good in it I I could

7057.86 --> 7064.299999999999
literally just I would sometimes I

7060.139 --> 7064.3
wouldn't even have to look at the screen

7064.94 --> 7069.699
and I would still win

7066.92 --> 7069.6990000000005
was crazy

7072.32 --> 7078.32
yeah I've never had anything other than

7076.34 --> 7080.719
yeah I don't have any of the newer

7078.32 --> 7084.34
computers or anything never had an Xbox

7080.719 --> 7084.34
never had a PS

7084.38 --> 7093.7390000000005
right I had a Commodore 64 Amiga 1200

7088.3 --> 7096.9400000000005
Nintendo NES Super Nintendo and a PC and

7093.739 --> 7096.94
that's where it all stopped

7105.619 --> 7109.54
that's where I'm at right now

7112.04 --> 7118.219
right man by the way

7114.98 --> 7120.98
that transition from Amiga 1200 to PC

7118.219 --> 7125.06
was a really tough one

7120.98 --> 7127.459999999999
like I because I really love the Amiga I

7125.06 --> 7130.280000000001
love the sound system on that it had

7127.46 --> 7133.88
such amazing potential what could be

7130.28 --> 7136.699
done with it it's just incredible

7133.88 --> 7139.82
such shame and it's freaking Bill Gates

7136.699 --> 7142.299999999999
man Bill Gates ruined it I'm not even

7139.82 --> 7142.299999999999
joking

7145.46 --> 7151.4
like not it's not even personal let's

7148.52 --> 7154.040000000001
just he maybe he did actually ruin it

7151.4 --> 7156.5
pressure I'm not sure he did actually

7154.04 --> 7159.34
make companies blow themselves up on

7156.5 --> 7159.34
purpose like that

7160.159 --> 7166.638999999999
but yeah Amiga just discontinued

7163.46 --> 7170.36
and then the PC I was like really

7166.639 --> 7173.4800000000005
reluctant because every freaking game on

7170.36 --> 7177.139
the PC at that time of the Amiga 1200

7173.48 --> 7179.54
all their games were ugly as [ __ ] like a

7177.139 --> 7181.52
really really ugly

7179.54 --> 7184.9
and I was like with the people they're

7181.52 --> 7188.599
like okay he's awesome like

7184.9 --> 7192.08
ew that's so ugly how can you think

7188.599 --> 7193.34
that's a good gaming computer yuck

7192.08 --> 7197.5
right

7193.34 --> 7197.5
and then Baldur's Gate came out

7197.599 --> 7202.88
literally just like that and then

7200.06 --> 7204.56
suddenly it was like

7202.88 --> 7206.78
okay

7204.56 --> 7210.099
all right

7206.78 --> 7214.239
I guess it's time to get a PC now

7210.099 --> 7214.2390000000005
that's how it happened literally

7215.719 --> 7217.9
foreign

7220.159 --> 7226.638999999999
still remember buying my first graphics

7223.04 --> 7230.3
card it had a whole

7226.639 --> 7232.82
eight megabyte Ram

7230.3 --> 7236.119000000001
man that was so much memory for a video

7232.82 --> 7238.96
card eight megabytes guys

7236.119 --> 7238.96
amazing

7255.28 --> 7260.599
3D FX card yeah exactly those are the

7258.739 --> 7263.48
ones

7260.599 --> 7266.4400000000005
so hilarious I think it worked though

7263.48 --> 7266.44
did its job

7275.96 --> 7280.94
mine is 12 gig yeah that's now

7278.78 --> 7283.46
not getting it George sand we're talking

7280.94 --> 7287.659
about the 90s

7283.46 --> 7292.4
in the 90s a four megabyte Ram 3D FX

7287.659 --> 7294.799999999999
card was like was the [ __ ] dude

7292.4 --> 7296.98
it would make things work smoothly and

7294.8 --> 7296.9800000000005
beautiful

7302.179 --> 7306.32
and they they quickly grew bigger and

7304.58 --> 7307.88
bigger and bigger but it still worked

7306.32 --> 7309.739
you know as long as it worked it was

7307.88 --> 7311.92
great

7309.739 --> 7311.919999999999
foreign

7320.0 --> 7325.06
artifact yeah lots of artifacts that's

7322.46 --> 7325.06
right rhino

7338.96 --> 7343.82
but yeah that's also because the

7340.88 --> 7345.32
programming back then was raw so yeah

7343.82 --> 7347.179
artifacts are going to happen because

7345.32 --> 7349.639
it's literally

7347.179 --> 7352.76
you gotta realize this that games back

7349.639 --> 7356.0
then they were inserted through like

7352.76 --> 7358.639
code like raw code

7356.0 --> 7360.92
it's like a giant transcript and if at

7358.639 --> 7363.5
least one thing is off either it doesn't

7360.92 --> 7367.76
work at all you have to find it what's

7363.5 --> 7369.56
wrong or it creates like a stupid little

7367.76 --> 7371.3
side effect that you don't even notice

7369.56 --> 7373.34
when you're testing it

7371.3 --> 7375.02
right that's how the artifacts came in

7373.34 --> 7376.58
it's like errors that they don't even

7375.02 --> 7379.540000000001
know where like where they come from

7376.58 --> 7379.54
they don't even know

7379.58 --> 7383.78
because that's raw program is really

7381.86 --> 7386.598999999999
tough that's how they did it all back

7383.78 --> 7388.639
then now it's all modules and modules

7386.599 --> 7392.06
this modules that

7388.639 --> 7395.3
it's not really even programming anymore

7392.06 --> 7399.38
so instead of artifacts now everything

7395.3 --> 7404.719
is super bloated now oh just install the

7399.38 --> 7408.26
game it's only 80 gigabytes large like

7404.719 --> 7412.219
who the [ __ ] came up with that right

7408.26 --> 7415.88
installing Ballers Gate 1 was like 200

7412.219 --> 7418.4
megabytes and that was huge

7415.88 --> 7420.619
I don't know if it's 200 something like

7418.4 --> 7423.5
that now it's like the game it's not

7420.619 --> 7427.88
even that big or impressive it's like

7423.5 --> 7430.159
freaking 80 gigabytes large like who the

7427.88 --> 7432.38
[ __ ] does that

7430.159 --> 7435.98
it's insane

7432.38 --> 7439.82
all because of modulizing module module

7435.98 --> 7441.5
module prefab text program things you

7439.82 --> 7444.32
don't have artifacts but everything

7441.5 --> 7446.0
becomes slow as [ __ ] and it takes up all

7444.32 --> 7449.599
your space

7446.0 --> 7452.739
so that's the price that's the price for

7449.599 --> 7452.7390000000005
no more artifacts

7457.28 --> 7462.86
oh yeah Arena yeah I remember that

7460.52 --> 7465.619000000001
putting two graphics cards

7462.86 --> 7467.42
in your computer and then a bridge and

7465.619 --> 7469.639
then you had double the power or more

7467.42 --> 7471.679
like one and a half times I I think I

7469.639 --> 7474.1990000000005
actually did that at some point

7471.679 --> 7477.219
it's hilarious

7474.199 --> 7477.219
I remember that

7488.9 --> 7491.619
foreign

7528.32 --> 7530.98
God

7533.83 --> 7540.469
[Applause]

7545.27 --> 7554.119000000001
[Applause]

7556.55 --> 7560.439
[Applause]

7568.099 --> 7570.34
foreign

7576.159 --> 7580.879999999999
oh wow you can

7578.36 --> 7583.659
you know

7580.88 --> 7583.659000000001
you could

7587.119 --> 7591.339999999999
but yeah the globe is finished that's

7589.099 --> 7591.34
right

7591.56 --> 7599.42
and yeah I think that the the Capstone

7595.3 --> 7601.28
of our Victory is the realization and

7599.42 --> 7602.599
the provable

7601.28 --> 7605.48
fact

7602.599 --> 7609.8
that the only reason the globe model

7605.48 --> 7612.32
even works is because the Earth is flat

7609.8 --> 7616.28
everything that it is based on is

7612.32 --> 7619.46
possible mathematically like is

7616.28 --> 7622.82
the way it twists things only works out

7619.46 --> 7625.219
because the Earth is actually flat if

7622.82 --> 7627.98
the Earth were actually a globe

7625.219 --> 7631.88
then it would be much harder

7627.98 --> 7633.799999999999
to do everything on that Globe Earth it

7631.88 --> 7635.599
would be harder to do the geometry it

7633.8 --> 7638.599
would be harder to

7635.599 --> 7640.9400000000005
explore and to orientate everything

7638.599 --> 7642.139
would be so much harder and it couldn't

7640.94 --> 7643.94
have

7642.139 --> 7647.0
rolled out

7643.94 --> 7649.94
and evolved into what it has become now

7647.0 --> 7652.82
the globe model if the Earth wasn't

7649.94 --> 7655.098999999999
actually flat

7652.82 --> 7658.04
they couldn't have done it like this the

7655.099 --> 7662.4800000000005
globe model as what it has become could

7658.04 --> 7665.239
not have become itself the way it is if

7662.48 --> 7667.5199999999995
the Earth wasn't flat

7665.239 --> 7669.919999999999
it only works because the Earth is flat

7667.52 --> 7672.5
the globe model only works because the

7669.92 --> 7674.719
Earth is flat

7672.5 --> 7677.26
yeah and what do you do after that point

7674.719 --> 7677.26
you know

7677.9 --> 7683.96
I mean except for just watch anti-flat

7681.679 --> 7688.159
earthers try to squirm their way through

7683.96 --> 7690.619
every time not letting it hit their

7688.159 --> 7693.159
conscious and all that but it is what it

7690.619 --> 7693.159
is you know

7711.5 --> 7716.119
foreign

7713.119 --> 7716.119
ER

7724.579 --> 7727.179
oh

7754.0 --> 7759.52
okay Johnny

7756.38 --> 7759.52
that's hilarious

7761.239 --> 7764.839999999999
but are you saying that he needs to come

7763.28 --> 7767.139
on camera I don't know if he wants to

7764.84 --> 7767.139
though

7767.3 --> 7774.34
I think 10th Man kind of likes to stay

7770.0 --> 7774.34
out of the out of the loop like that

7779.78 --> 7786.099
it would be pretty cool though if we had

7781.94 --> 7786.098999999999
like more in the field demonstrations

7786.199 --> 7790.239
have you ever used to sex it no I mean

7789.199 --> 7793.219
I've

7790.239 --> 7796.339999999999
calculated the angle of the Sun versus

7793.219 --> 7799.04
The Horizon at some point it's like I

7796.34 --> 7800.06
don't know how old I was 12 or 60 or

7799.04 --> 7802.28
something

7800.06 --> 7804.88
yeah I've held the sex and I've tried it

7802.28 --> 7804.88
out one time

7804.92 --> 7811.34
do I then know how to cross reference

7808.159 --> 7813.0199999999995
that data with like the charts and

7811.34 --> 7815.02
everything no

7813.02 --> 7815.02
no

7823.46 --> 7827.9
I mean with some practice if you

7826.04 --> 7830.599
basically let me hang around a person

7827.9 --> 7832.699
that knows perfectly how to do it and

7830.599 --> 7835.099
that shows how to do it a couple of

7832.699 --> 7837.82
times then I could probably learn it

7835.099 --> 7837.82
really quickly

7839.659 --> 7844.9
but it's not like a base talent I have

7849.5 --> 7855.28
two shows at the same time no there's no

7852.199 --> 7855.28
life letters debate

7864.92 --> 7867.4
oh

7867.44 --> 7874.54
oh man I got another PayPal donation

7871.76 --> 7874.54
from

7874.599 --> 7881.78
that what is it is that panda bear again

7878.78 --> 7884.0599999999995
wow man thank you

7881.78 --> 7887.8
I just noticed that you're getting

7884.06 --> 7887.8
paypals and not even telling me

7887.96 --> 7893.86
well thank you very much it's like dudes

7890.84 --> 7893.860000000001
helping a lot

7893.9 --> 7898.299999999999
to wouldn't really know what to do

7895.579 --> 7898.299999999999
without this

7899.84 --> 7904.179
thank you very much for the continuing

7901.88 --> 7904.179
support

7907.28 --> 7912.5599999999995
was it flatter Sage I don't know but

7910.34 --> 7915.32
anyway whoever gave that thank you very

7912.56 --> 7917.56
much I really appreciate it it keeps me

7915.32 --> 7917.5599999999995
going

7929.42 --> 7936.02
I need to show someone using the Sextant

7932.239 --> 7938.48
out at Sea based on this assumption well

7936.02 --> 7940.599
that would be freaking hilarious you

7938.48 --> 7940.598999999999
know

7941.78 --> 7946.48
I think they'd ever go for it but how

7944.3 --> 7950.179
funny would it be if we did like a

7946.48 --> 7952.78
baller versus flat Sexton

7950.179 --> 7952.78
race

7954.619 --> 7962.199
right about Race using Sexton only like

7958.76 --> 7962.1990000000005
you know GPS allowed

7963.02 --> 7968.719
right or you have a referee that does

7966.26 --> 7971.119000000001
have GPS and not saying don't bring any

7968.719 --> 7972.92
GPS because yeah if things really go

7971.119 --> 7975.98
wrong you do kind of want to have it

7972.92 --> 7977.179
right but only let the referee have the

7975.98 --> 7979.218999999999
GPS

7977.179 --> 7980.96
and then do a race

7979.219 --> 7983.7390000000005
like a

7980.96 --> 7983.7390000000005
I don't know

7984.32 --> 7990.5
from England to

7987.86 --> 7992.598999999999
what is it to New England or something

7990.5 --> 7995.36
right

7992.599 --> 7998.900000000001
from Ireland to New England

7995.36 --> 8001.659
and then do a race using a sexton on a

7998.9 --> 8004.36
boat and there's referees and they do

8001.659 --> 8006.96
have like yeah you want to be able to

8004.36 --> 8010.36
contact the emergency things whatever

8006.96 --> 8012.639
and have a GPS available for if things

8010.36 --> 8015.28
really go wrong

8012.639 --> 8017.56
but then it's like yeah they keep it a

8015.28 --> 8020.0199999999995
secret Referee on the boat and then like

8017.56 --> 8023.8
flat earthers

8020.02 --> 8027.52
and then the globers and a camera that

8023.8 --> 8029.8
has to be recorded right no yeah they

8027.52 --> 8032.38
have to be honest about what they do

8029.8 --> 8034.659000000001
and then yeah let's do a uh an

8032.38 --> 8037.3
exploration race

8034.659 --> 8039.46
using this accent

8037.3 --> 8042.52
and then let's see how well that works

8039.46 --> 8043.54
out for the globe whale using the

8042.52 --> 8045.6990000000005
section

8043.54 --> 8048.48
this is

8045.699 --> 8048.48
ah

8049.9 --> 8053.28
that would be hilarious

8058.98 --> 8067.379999999999
Atlantic race yeah something like that

8062.94 --> 8067.379999999999
transatlantic Sextant challenge

8073.3 --> 8077.38
yeah but you better

8075.159 --> 8079.839999999999
when you're gonna do it then do it in

8077.38 --> 8081.76
the season when the sea the ocean is the

8079.84 --> 8083.8
least Restless right you don't want to

8081.76 --> 8085.659000000001
like go through it in the middle of a

8083.8 --> 8088.92
super heavy storm

8085.659 --> 8088.92
that would suck

8090.4 --> 8095.799999999999
but still yeah

8092.86 --> 8098.5199999999995
make the the race

8095.8 --> 8101.860000000001
like on a long enough stretch of ocean

8098.52 --> 8105.099
that you'll definitely lose

8101.86 --> 8106.239
visual track of all land right that's

8105.099 --> 8108.579
important

8106.239 --> 8110.619
so that they are basically at some point

8108.579 --> 8113.32
going to be purely adrift at the ocean

8110.619 --> 8115.36
and they have to use the section to find

8113.32 --> 8119.82
their way out

8115.36 --> 8119.82
that would be an interesting challenge

8121.659 --> 8124.839999999999
oh once you splatter said yeah thank you

8123.94 --> 8127.0599999999995
man

8124.84 --> 8128.619000000001
was it for 33 years yeah yeah something

8127.06 --> 8131.679
like that

8128.619 --> 8135.46
yeah unfortunately PayPal does

8131.679 --> 8138.099
take a slight chunk out of it

8135.46 --> 8140.38
but I still got plenty thank you very

8138.099 --> 8143.52
much man

8140.38 --> 8147.0
yeah it was it was 33

8143.52 --> 8147.0
33.89 yeah

8174.94 --> 8182.32
far north as the Army would know

8178.719 --> 8184.86
I wouldn't do that no let's not like a

8182.32 --> 8187.42
Sextant race is not about secretly

8184.86 --> 8192.099
exploring the regions we're not supposed

8187.42 --> 8194.26
to go no it's just about using Sexton

8192.099 --> 8195.639000000001
and who whose approach works better

8194.26 --> 8199.359
right

8195.639 --> 8203.319
I want to see like the anti-flat Earth

8199.359 --> 8205.960000000001
there's goof around with their plum

8203.319 --> 8207.76
like they're Plum Sexton and oh we're

8205.96 --> 8210.639
not gonna look at the Horizon it's just

8207.76 --> 8212.92
gonna DPM the star of the plum oh I want

8210.639 --> 8214.42
to see them try that it would be

8212.92 --> 8216.28
hilarious

8214.42 --> 8219.88
like how are you even gonna

8216.28 --> 8222.179
you're on a moving ship on an ocean it's

8219.88 --> 8224.559
moving how are you gonna get that bubble

8222.179 --> 8226.54
it's like how are you even gonna do that

8224.559 --> 8228.819
what are you gonna hold it really steal

8226.54 --> 8231.7
us about rocks underneath you you can

8228.819 --> 8233.979
hold a bubble so it's stable it'll be

8231.7 --> 8235.960000000001
perfectly still on a moving boat really

8233.979 --> 8239.58
how are you gonna do that

8235.96 --> 8239.58
it's just so silly

8239.8 --> 8244.179
I want to see it on camera I want to see

8242.2 --> 8246.7
them actually do it that would be

8244.179 --> 8248.88
hilarious

8246.7 --> 8248.880000000001
foreign

8272.74 --> 8277.809
Earth

8274.719 --> 8277.809
[Music]

8309.76 --> 8317.04
before I think

8311.62 --> 8317.04
let her others would get lost across it

8319.5 --> 8323.92
Brickle track what the [ __ ] are you

8322.3 --> 8326.759999999998
blabbering about

8323.92 --> 8326.76
what track

8327.04 --> 8335.92
this is orientation and exploration

8332.439 --> 8338.139000000001
navigation sorry this is navigation

8335.92 --> 8340.179
concerning the sexton what the hell does

8338.139 --> 8343.199999999999
that have to do with any track you're

8340.179 --> 8343.2
not given a track

8352.179 --> 8358.179
great circle track Mercator navigation

8356.08 --> 8361.5
what

8358.179 --> 8361.5
does that have to do with it

8362.62 --> 8368.019
I think that flat earthers can pretty

8365.62 --> 8370.0
much use yeah you can use whatever map

8368.019 --> 8371.859
you want

8370.0 --> 8373.84
doesn't really matter you can use any

8371.859 --> 8378.16
map

8373.84 --> 8381.099
this is about operating the sexton

8378.16 --> 8383.74
in the physical world out there not like

8381.099 --> 8387.7
how do you eventually feed that back to

8383.74 --> 8391.319
your positioning system using a map

8387.7 --> 8391.319000000001
that's not really relevant

8394.42 --> 8399.88
it's about actually

8396.42 --> 8402.460000000001
orientating where you are navigating

8399.88 --> 8404.74
using the Sextant figuring it out not

8402.46 --> 8408.358999999999
getting lost

8404.74 --> 8408.359
that's what the challenge is about

8412.96 --> 8419.019999999999
just bath from 80. okay fine

8423.1 --> 8430.66
this is not about oh let's get Tactical

8427.66 --> 8433.72
right this is not about oh what's

8430.66 --> 8435.64
according to the map seems to be the

8433.72 --> 8437.619999999999
shortest route that's not what this is

8435.64 --> 8442.0
about this is about

8437.62 --> 8445.0
will you be able to ex to arrive

8442.0 --> 8447.7
at the designated destination exactly

8445.0 --> 8449.319
which would be like a city a coastal

8447.7 --> 8451.6
city or something

8449.319 --> 8454.84
very specific point on the other side

8451.6 --> 8457.66
that's what it's about not like oh this

8454.84 --> 8461.16
map makes it seem like this is a shorter

8457.66 --> 8461.16
route that's completely irrelevant

8495.28 --> 8500.16
okay Fight The Mirage fine

8500.319 --> 8506.979
if you say so I'm not a

8502.899 --> 8511.06
I'm not a navigator

8506.979 --> 8514.42
right so why don't you uh put down those

8511.06 --> 8516.279999999999
details in front of 10th man why don't

8514.42 --> 8518.319
you discuss that with him I'm pretty

8516.28 --> 8520.720000000001
sure he will know exactly what you're

8518.319 --> 8523.92
talking about I'm not correctly I don't

8520.72 --> 8523.92
really know what you're talking about

8525.46 --> 8530.979
I just thought up the just the sexton

8528.22 --> 8533.5
challenge Sexton

8530.979 --> 8537.539999999999
Flat Earth versus globe challenge can

8533.5 --> 8537.54
you operate a Saxon on a globe

8556.88 --> 8559.97
[Music]

8561.46 --> 8566.8
the South doesn't exist what the [ __ ]

8563.979 --> 8570.819
are you talking about right now what are

8566.8 --> 8573.519999999999
you talking about South doesn't exist

8570.819 --> 8577.42
where are you getting that from

8573.52 --> 8581.08
but you're me you mean a disk model

8577.42 --> 8582.04
the disk model reified into into the

8581.08 --> 8584.64
terrain

8582.04 --> 8584.640000000001
that

8584.92 --> 8591.06
oh [ __ ] off Sean Hawkins you [ __ ]

8587.8 --> 8591.06
[ __ ] piss off

8593.319 --> 8600.699999999999
don't care for your Eternal whining spam

8598.54 --> 8603.359
it's not about you you're not gonna be

8600.7 --> 8603.359
on that boat

8614.14 --> 8622.66
on a flat Earth is it ever no no that's

8617.74 --> 8626.26
on the desk model radar disk model

8622.66 --> 8629.26
a disk model reified into the terrain

8626.26 --> 8632.2
claimed to be literal and euclidean it

8629.26 --> 8634.359
isn't the Earth is not the disk model

8632.2 --> 8637.84
that's not what it is

8634.359 --> 8640.78
that's not a proper scaled layout it's

8637.84 --> 8642.880000000001
not the literal Earth the disk model is

8640.78 --> 8645.76
not the literal Earth the disk model is

8642.88 --> 8649.56
not the literal Earth the disk model is

8645.76 --> 8649.56
not the literal Earth

8654.76 --> 8663.399
just a way to represent the data

8660.22 --> 8667.539999999999
through a projection a map projection

8663.399 --> 8670.84
it's not the literal Terrain

8667.54 --> 8673.18
I don't think it's even orientated in

8670.84 --> 8676.12
disk fashion like that I don't think

8673.18 --> 8678.1
there is a North Pole Point literally I

8676.12 --> 8681.819000000001
don't think there is that point

8678.1 --> 8683.56
and if there is then yeah

8681.819 --> 8685.84
that makes things a little bit more

8683.56 --> 8687.76
complicated and definitely especially

8685.84 --> 8690.58
non-linear

8687.76 --> 8693.64
so whatever the total surface space

8690.58 --> 8696.06
available to us within the volume of our

8693.64 --> 8696.06
Realm

8696.34 --> 8701.979
whatever that's like I don't know it

8699.04 --> 8703.78
could be like a giant triangle and the

8701.979 --> 8707.8
North Pole

8703.78 --> 8709.060000000001
is at that point is at one point of the

8707.8 --> 8711.34
triangle

8709.06 --> 8714.34
and the South Poles

8711.34 --> 8716.92
whatever that would be could be the cell

8714.34 --> 8718.6
yeah that could be the the other two

8716.92 --> 8721.0
points

8718.6 --> 8723.52
and all the space in between I don't

8721.0 --> 8725.2
know how the layout is exactly I just

8723.52 --> 8729.28
known that

8725.2 --> 8731.979000000001
the disk map projection is not a literal

8729.28 --> 8733.899000000001
to scale representation of the terrain

8731.979 --> 8736.479
which is like the physical Earth it's

8733.899 --> 8740.38
still a map projection it's a globe

8736.479 --> 8743.38
based map projection based on globe

8740.38 --> 8745.96
system the orientation of the celestial

8743.38 --> 8748.358999999999
lights which are an apparent globe

8745.96 --> 8750.899
it's not an accurate representation of

8748.359 --> 8750.899000000001
the terrain

8766.3 --> 8771.22
right looping theory model

8769.18 --> 8773.2
right well the the main distinction is

8771.22 --> 8776.74
rectangular

8773.2 --> 8778.6
right there's a loop east to west

8776.74 --> 8781.119999999999
it's all

8778.6 --> 8785.26
not desk

8781.12 --> 8787.42
it's all squared rectangular North is a

8785.26 --> 8790.06
direction South is the direction East

8787.42 --> 8792.939
and West are directions and they Loop

8790.06 --> 8795.16
and maybe just maybe

8792.939 --> 8796.42
don't know if we'll ever find out within

8795.16 --> 8798.22
our lifetime

8796.42 --> 8802.12
for sure

8798.22 --> 8805.3
South and North Loops two

8802.12 --> 8807.1
it could be doesn't have to be but it

8805.3 --> 8810.938999999998
could be

8807.1 --> 8813.640000000001
and if you orientate the terrain in that

8810.939 --> 8817.12
fashion using a rectangular map which is

8813.64 --> 8820.24
like even the most reliably used map for

8817.12 --> 8821.740000000002
orientation in general right so is that

8820.24 --> 8824.08
the terrain

8821.74 --> 8826.6
is that actually the terrain is it

8824.08 --> 8829.3
rectangular well if it is then that

8826.6 --> 8831.819
means there is a loop east to west can

8829.3 --> 8834.519999999999
only be that

8831.819 --> 8837.16
if you want to escape the concept of a

8834.52 --> 8841.66
loop within the orientation of the realm

8837.16 --> 8845.2
then the equator line must be a circle

8841.66 --> 8848.38
it must be a literal euclidean Circle

8845.2 --> 8851.439
and it must be proven to be that

8848.38 --> 8853.899
no calculating no well let's rearrange

8851.439 --> 8856.479000000001
the projection of the data no it must be

8853.899 --> 8859.42
a literal Circle where if you fly over

8856.479 --> 8861.46
it with a plane you are literally

8859.42 --> 8863.56
turning constantly

8861.46 --> 8866.979
if it's not that

8863.56 --> 8869.439
the equator line is not a literal Circle

8866.979 --> 8872.76
then the realm is looping and there's

8869.439 --> 8872.76
nothing you could do about it

8874.12 --> 8878.560000000001
then the entire realm space confine is

8877.18 --> 8882.78
not euclidean

8878.56 --> 8882.779999999999
it's a self-contained space

8883.54 --> 8887.859
current's looping theory is a fact I

8885.939 --> 8890.68
don't know about that steamy traveler I

8887.859 --> 8893.319
don't know about that I just know that

8890.68 --> 8896.64
the way I put it down as to what could

8893.319 --> 8896.64
be is correct

8908.38 --> 8915.399
just me big look no no no it's not it's

8911.92 --> 8919.78
not a globe there's no curve

8915.399 --> 8923.439
their Horizon is not geometric

8919.78 --> 8925.960000000001
there's no coriolis deviation and the

8923.439 --> 8928.84
realm is contained because we have gas

8925.96 --> 8930.539999999999
pressure it cannot the volume available

8928.84 --> 8934.899
cannot be

8930.54 --> 8938.439
Galactic sized because then we would not

8934.899 --> 8941.38
have a gas pressure gradient that is

8938.439 --> 8944.08
literally sizable that is you can size

8941.38 --> 8946.96
up the differences over

8944.08 --> 8950.439
simple distances yeah if the total

8946.96 --> 8952.779999999999
available volume the universe for gas to

8950.439 --> 8954.880000000001
fill would be as large as the

8952.78 --> 8957.7
heliocentric model suggests

8954.88 --> 8962.46
then we would not have a gradient the

8957.7 --> 8962.460000000001
way we do here on Earth fact

8964.54 --> 8969.52
the Earth is absolutely not a globe

8966.76 --> 8970.6
doesn't matter what you think what you

8969.52 --> 8974.5
say

8970.6 --> 8978.640000000001
flaws obstacles problems we run into

8974.5 --> 8981.1
figuring things out it's not a globe it

8978.64 --> 8983.8
never will be a globe it cannot be a

8981.1 --> 8985.06
globe it's never going to turn out to be

8983.8 --> 8987.88
a globe

8985.06 --> 8989.019999999999
you get it it's not a globe it never

8987.88 --> 8991.66
will be

8989.02 --> 8994.899000000001
but hey if it's looping it gets all

8991.66 --> 8997.18
weird and loopy then yeah God might have

8994.899 --> 8999.64
just said hey people you think you're

8997.18 --> 9001.859
smart well go [ __ ] yourself if you think

8999.64 --> 9004.38
you're smart because guess what it's a

9001.859 --> 9006.06
flat Globe yeah it could be a flat globe

9004.38 --> 9009.479
and then we're all just like gonna be

9006.06 --> 9012.18
tortured by freaking surreal nature

9009.479 --> 9015.358999999999
while we're standing on right it's all

9012.18 --> 9017.819
flat perfectly flat perfectly level flat

9015.359 --> 9021.24
everywhere flat the whole way the entire

9017.819 --> 9023.76
surface flat from one side to the other

9021.24 --> 9026.939
but when you try to put it together it

9023.76 --> 9030.06
might still form a globe

9026.939 --> 9033.18
it's just a flat globe and none of that

9030.06 --> 9036.899
makes geometrical sense you cannot

9033.18 --> 9039.12
create it in miniature fashion if that

9036.899 --> 9042.84
were the case it would be an un

9039.12 --> 9046.439
overcomeable surreal nature of the realm

9042.84 --> 9048.6
that we will be facing the flat globe

9046.439 --> 9050.58
never going to be a literal Globe never

9048.6 --> 9054.359
a geometric low

9050.58 --> 9057.84
the globe is near a side note

9054.359 --> 9059.34
as to how land masses orientate in

9057.84 --> 9061.979
relation to each other

9059.34 --> 9064.319
none of it is actually a globe none of

9061.979 --> 9067.26
it is curved none of it has any

9064.319 --> 9069.18
geometric aspects to it it's all flat

9067.26 --> 9071.58
all of it it always will be flooded

9069.18 --> 9075.54
always has been flat because the Earth

9071.58 --> 9079.02
is flat and it's not a geometric literal

9075.54 --> 9082.26
Globe no matter what you think what you

9079.02 --> 9087.84
don't think what you reason out what you

9082.26 --> 9090.02
try to escape from it's not a globe

9087.84 --> 9090.02
foreign

9096.14 --> 9101.279999999999
facts and if you lie to yourself then

9099.359 --> 9102.06
the globe makes so much more sense I

9101.28 --> 9106.2
know

9102.06 --> 9109.619999999999
I know Satan makes so much more sense if

9106.2 --> 9112.979000000001
you just believe him if you just accept

9109.62 --> 9115.380000000001
the lies it all makes sense now yeah

9112.979 --> 9118.199999999999
just accept the lies it doesn't make any

9115.38 --> 9121.679999999998
sense just accept it right it's a globe

9118.2 --> 9125.220000000001
it has to be because I'm dumb

9121.68 --> 9128.64
I'm dumb and I don't understand when I'm

9125.22 --> 9131.34
bumping into or erroneous situations

9128.64 --> 9134.279999999999
that are obviously wrong obviously

9131.34 --> 9136.56
incorrect data that I'm assuming because

9134.28 --> 9139.62
I want it to be a globe because you

9136.56 --> 9142.199999999999
don't care what reality is you just want

9139.62 --> 9144.12
it Globe you just wanted Globe you don't

9142.2 --> 9146.76
want a reality you just wanted Globe

9144.12 --> 9150.62
because you're a liar and you suck

9146.76 --> 9150.62
Satan's [ __ ] like a [ __ ]

9173.1 --> 9175.939
ah

9190.68 --> 9196.56
why Globe shape satanic because it's a

9193.439 --> 9199.5
lie that's why because it's not a globe

9196.56 --> 9202.68
and you're lying you're a liar you

9199.5 --> 9206.76
ignore facts as in actual empirical

9202.68 --> 9209.76
repeatable logic based measured facts

9206.76 --> 9212.34
that you ignore you ignore it you're a

9209.76 --> 9215.1
liar because you ignore facts in order

9212.34 --> 9217.08
to imagine how it works so much better

9215.1 --> 9220.08
on the globe which it doesn't because it

9217.08 --> 9222.66
is in the globe because the facts are

9220.08 --> 9225.42
elusive you don't have Earth curvature

9222.66 --> 9227.399
The Horizon is not geometric

9225.42 --> 9229.62
it's not a globe

9227.399 --> 9231.96
you just like to think of it as a globe

9229.62 --> 9235.319000000001
and that makes you satanic that makes

9231.96 --> 9236.759999999998
you a liar a liar to yourself first and

9235.319 --> 9239.399
foremost

9236.76 --> 9242.04
that's what it does makes you suck

9239.399 --> 9244.68
Satan's [ __ ] you're a liar you lie to

9242.04 --> 9245.76
yourself and through that you lie to

9244.68 --> 9249.899
others

9245.76 --> 9252.06
you're a liar you believe in lies

9249.899 --> 9253.979
you think that the Earth is a globe even

9252.06 --> 9256.26
though you have no evidence for it in

9253.979 --> 9260.22
everything that you need

9256.26 --> 9262.08
it for right everything that you need to

9260.22 --> 9264.96
be there in order for it to be a globe

9262.08 --> 9268.14
doesn't exist it's not actually there

9264.96 --> 9270.779999999999
it's made up it's a lie because the

9268.14 --> 9273.358999999999
Earth is flat it's not a globe and if

9270.78 --> 9276.720000000001
you keep on perpetuating that you're a

9273.359 --> 9279.74
liar and you suck Satan's [ __ ]

9276.72 --> 9279.74
so good luck with that

9283.08 --> 9286.38
no you don't have evidence you [ __ ]

[ __ ]

9286.38 --> 9289.938999999998
get the [ __ ] out of here

9312.47 --> 9315.519999999999
[Music]

9345.66 --> 9348.26

9352.02 --> 9357.08

oh man

9387.84 --> 9395.12
whoa dude

9390.2 --> 9395.12
already two and a half hours damn

9396.359 --> 9399.899000000001
right I'm gonna round out the show soon

9398.399 --> 9401.819
though

9399.899 --> 9404.46
because now

9401.819 --> 9406.92
I've run out of mint tea as well

9404.46 --> 9408.66
almost that is anyway gonna take another

9406.92 --> 9411.5
two minute break I'll be right back and

9408.66 --> 9411.5
then I'm gonna run out

9495.66 --> 9497.84
foreign

9523.38 --> 9528.66
Globe makes more sense no no the globe

9526.2 --> 9531.54
is more programmed

9528.66 --> 9534.18
you're more programmed to go with the

9531.54 --> 9536.76
globe it's called peer pressure Based

9534.18 --> 9538.5
Teaching it's not actually teaching it's

9536.76 --> 9541.979
just peer pressure

9538.5 --> 9543.84
that you've mistakingly taken for

9541.979 --> 9546.119999999999
teaching

9543.84 --> 9548.880000000001
because of the pressure you just accept

9546.12 --> 9551.1
it because if everybody accepts it and

9548.88 --> 9552.839999999998
everybody around you has been through it

9551.1 --> 9554.28
and you've seen them go through it and

9552.84 --> 9555.78
then you see them come out of it and

9554.28 --> 9558.0
they're like oh they accept the peer

9555.78 --> 9560.7
pressure now they can repeat it they're

9558.0 --> 9563.58
part of the system yeah

9560.7 --> 9565.2
it's not because it makes more sense on

9563.58 --> 9568.439
a globe it's because you've been

9565.2 --> 9571.02
conditioned to believe that without

9568.439 --> 9573.78
evidence without inquiry without

9571.02 --> 9576.12
actually figuring out the facts because

9573.78 --> 9578.16
every time that when the facts are

9576.12 --> 9580.740000000002
presented to you

9578.16 --> 9583.14
even verbally

9580.74 --> 9585.6
you forget about it I've already

9583.14 --> 9588.619999999999
mentioned why it is in the globe white

9585.6 --> 9592.2
absolutely is in the globe

9588.62 --> 9594.42
all the claims the globe makes have been

9592.2 --> 9596.58
refuted all of them that's why we got

9594.42 --> 9600.12
the housekeeping questions yes you are

9596.58 --> 9603.359
prayer pressured Reno you are you were

9600.12 --> 9605.7
as a kid everybody was

9603.359 --> 9607.92
real peer pressured

9605.7 --> 9611.640000000001
go with the globe it makes more sense

9607.92 --> 9614.399
because that's what is there everywhere

9611.64 --> 9617.278999999999
the math can be made out to work as long

9614.399 --> 9619.08
as you keep focusing on the the apparent

9617.279 --> 9621.6
sphere of the Stars which are

9619.08 --> 9624.18
holographic by the way very confusing I

9621.6 --> 9627.479000000001
know yeah more confusion used to

9624.18 --> 9630.62
weaponize against you right

9627.479 --> 9633.899
confusion of reality can be used to be

9630.62 --> 9636.359
weaponized against your psyche didn't

9633.899 --> 9639.96
you realize that

9636.359 --> 9641.279
yeah when reality is so difficult to

9639.96 --> 9646.919999999998
comprehend

9641.279 --> 9648.6
it can be used against you that's what's

9646.92 --> 9652.279
happened

9648.6 --> 9657.359
they've used the complicated reality

9652.279 --> 9661.859
against your psyche make you latch on to

9657.359 --> 9666.42
the seemingly easier option

9661.859 --> 9667.640000000001
the globe it's easier everybody talks

9666.42 --> 9672.42
about that

9667.64 --> 9675.5
everybody's working with that yes it is

9672.42 --> 9675.5
yeah really

9675.66 --> 9681.6
there is no evidence for the globe there

9678.18 --> 9684.84
is no evidence for the globe even the

9681.6 --> 9687.479000000001
very concept of evidence and proof and

9684.84 --> 9690.68
scientific method-based actual science

9687.479 --> 9695.039999999999
it has all been destroyed

9690.68 --> 9701.399
grounded up into nonsense

9695.04 --> 9704.04
just to make you believe the globe

9701.399 --> 9705.72
you don't even know what evidence is

9704.04 --> 9708.359
anymore because of the globe

9705.72 --> 9710.58
conditioning you literally don't know

9708.359 --> 9714.42
what evidence is

9710.58 --> 9717.439
because of the globe conditioning

9714.42 --> 9717.439
don't you get it

9729.62 --> 9732.709
[Music]

9743.1 --> 9747.12
life and not an enjoying yeah I know

9745.38 --> 9749.399
it's very enjoyable

9747.12 --> 9752.220000000001
yeah that part though about the Earth

9749.399 --> 9755.399
being a globe that was a lie

9752.22 --> 9758.819
you understand it was a lie oh and just

9755.399 --> 9761.699999999999
for the record God is real

9758.819 --> 9764.519999999999
and everything you do weaknesses and

9761.7 --> 9768.0
strength it's all gonna be

9764.52 --> 9769.560000000001
sized up you're gonna be judged judge

9768.0 --> 9772.979
judges everybody

9769.56 --> 9776.939
he does it right now it's just this yeah

9772.979 --> 9780.3
God's just crazy how flexible he gets

9776.939 --> 9784.14
very hard for a man to actually imagine

9780.3 --> 9787.14
how God how and why God does that and

9784.14 --> 9789.06
have to say whenever I try to personify

9787.14 --> 9793.26
God in some way even though you can't

9789.06 --> 9796.019999999999
really do that it does he pisses me off

9793.26 --> 9799.14
he pisses me off because he's so [ __ ]

9796.02 --> 9801.359
tolerant to evil he really is not on the

9799.14 --> 9804.539999999999
long run but on the short run and it

9801.359 --> 9806.939
pisses me off God it pisses me off the

9804.54 --> 9810.5
ugliness you allowed to be Unleashed

9806.939 --> 9810.5
everywhere like this

9813.12 --> 9818.279
right

9814.979 --> 9820.08
but yeah he's there you're on a flat

9818.279 --> 9822.060000000001
Earth

9820.08 --> 9824.16
and yeah

9822.06 --> 9825.96
have a good time by all means just

9824.16 --> 9828.3
realize

9825.96 --> 9830.88
yeah it's here for a purpose you are

9828.3 --> 9832.438999999998
here for a purpose you serve a function

9830.88 --> 9835.92
for God

9832.439 --> 9839.720000000001
not just for through God for the world

9835.92 --> 9839.72
no for God directly

9842.52 --> 9851.7
considerably we might even be parts

9846.84 --> 9855.359
of God's spirit micro fragments

9851.7 --> 9857.52
that transform and reunite and that

9855.359 --> 9859.319
means that we are literally a part of

9857.52 --> 9862.74
God like a

9859.319 --> 9865.399
a spiritual essential part of God

9862.74 --> 9865.399
himself

9866.52 --> 9871.08
part of his substance

9868.859 --> 9874.02
we might be

9871.08 --> 9875.88
our spirits that is so yeah what we do

9874.02 --> 9878.220000000001
is important

9875.88 --> 9880.8
it always is going through the

9878.22 --> 9882.479
weaknesses and strengths is all part of

9880.8 --> 9885.42
it

9882.479 --> 9888.42
to understand the difference

9885.42 --> 9891.62
to not just be colored by whatever mood

9888.42 --> 9894.72
you are in at the time for your entire

9891.62 --> 9898.04
long-term world view

9894.72 --> 9898.039999999999
all of this is important

9898.92 --> 9901.399
it's this

9902.1 --> 9906.140000000001
Perkins what a [ __ ] [ __ ]

9907.08 --> 9914.039999999999
there's never clearly proves it oh my

9910.2 --> 9917.300000000001
god oh Sean Hawkins

9914.04 --> 9917.300000000001
Sean Hawkins

9917.939 --> 9923.819
I must be missing his retirement home

9921.42 --> 9926.64
I mean the guy really needs to be put in

9923.819 --> 9928.619999999999
a retirement home for sure

9926.64 --> 9931.619999999999
just

9928.62 --> 9934.68
keep him busy so he stopped nagging

9931.62 --> 9937.399000000001
other people like a crazy old coot

9934.68 --> 9937.399
that he is

9944.84 --> 9952.5
and he's so easily identified I mean he

9948.479 --> 9955.38
tries to even go in Anonymous it just

9952.5 --> 9957.84
doesn't work it's he's so stupid you can

9955.38 --> 9960.42
literally just read it off him even as

9957.84 --> 9963.92
he tries to be anonymous he's so [ __ ]

9960.42 --> 9963.92
stupid it's unbelievable

9964.02 --> 9966.2
foreign

9967.8 --> 9972.66
I mean I think that pretty much every

9970.5 --> 9975.6
actual

9972.66 --> 9979.56
like genetic or even by accident

9975.6 --> 9981.779
clinical [ __ ] actual [ __ ] that I've

9979.56 --> 9985.56
met in my life I think that they're all

9981.779 --> 9988.26
actually smarter than John Hawkins

9985.56 --> 9991.14
right they might seem a little weird or

9988.26 --> 9993.899
awkward or have my trouble communicating

9991.14 --> 9998.16
but I'm pretty damn sure they were all

9993.899 --> 10001.34
smarter than Sean hawkins's

9998.16 --> 10003.38
so to call Sean Hawkins a [ __ ] is

10001.34 --> 10008.319
actually when you think about it kind of

10003.38 --> 10008.319
an insult to people that are [ __ ]

10009.439 --> 10013.809000000001

very tough to get certain data through

10178.939 --> 10183.56

10180.92 --> 10186.319
worked out now

10183.56 --> 10188.8

without some kind of social welfare

10268.7 --> 10274.819000000001
