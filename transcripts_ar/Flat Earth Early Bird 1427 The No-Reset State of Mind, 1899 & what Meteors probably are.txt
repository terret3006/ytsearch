over the night thank you dank

107.579 --> 112.25899999999999
right

108.96 --> 114.17999999999999
so the weather today is actually

112.259 --> 117.36
very interesting

114.18 --> 122.119
I've had an amazing

117.36 --> 122.119
two hours before the show

122.399 --> 128.64
because it's been like it's suddenly

124.68 --> 130.56
just cleared up amazingly and it was

128.64 --> 132.35999999999999
yeah two hours ago there weren't even

130.56 --> 137.76
these clouds there

132.36 --> 140.04000000000002
and I had some straight onto the chair

137.76 --> 142.44
where I continued reading the Rudolph

140.04 --> 146.04
Steiner book I had

142.44 --> 148.57999999999998
in the bright Sun so that was freaking

146.04 --> 148.57999999999998
amazing

155.76 --> 158.78
just look at that

164.94 --> 170.459
it is pretty cold though

167.819 --> 172.56
so I've tried to keep that door as

170.459 --> 176.12
closed as possible though not entirely

172.56 --> 176.12
close I do need my fresh air

184.09 --> 187.92000000000002
[Music]

185.519 --> 195.239
right

187.92 --> 195.23899999999998
it is Saturday the 19th of November 2022

199.14 --> 203.659
um

200.28 --> 203.659
let's check the temperature

204.78 --> 210.14000000000001
whoa three degrees Celsius

214.739 --> 221.78
yeah it's called wow it's even gonna

217.379 --> 221.78
freeze this night it says

222.239 --> 224.9
hmm

230.879 --> 233.659
a little bit

238.08 --> 243.65900000000002
right so I'm starting exactly on time

241.08 --> 248.15900000000002
today for a change

243.659 --> 250.439
but yeah I'm usually a little late

248.159 --> 252.239
so of course nobody's here right now in

250.439 --> 254.099
the chat

252.239 --> 256.459
although there are five people watching

254.099 --> 260.699
it says

256.459 --> 265.58
anyway yeah I'm really inspired

260.699 --> 268.88
I mean I I read a few pages

265.58 --> 268.88
and got

269.0 --> 274.139
faced with the typical issues that I

272.4 --> 276.29999999999995
have reading books

274.139 --> 279.3
especially when things get really good

276.3 --> 282.6
it's like I'm reading and then it's like

279.3 --> 286.02000000000004
then I'm suddenly trying to read while

282.6 --> 287.40000000000003
at the same time branching off in my

286.02 --> 288.85999999999996
thinking

287.4 --> 291.479
like

288.86 --> 293.52000000000004
simultaneously simulating comparing a

291.479 --> 296.46
situation that I was reminded of and

293.52 --> 298.68
then eventually I just lose track of

296.46 --> 299.69899999999996
what I'm reading I'm like oh damn it it

298.68 --> 301.8
happened again

299.699 --> 304.08000000000004
because it's like that happens when

301.8 --> 308.24
there's a lot to reflect on

304.08 --> 308.24
and my God Rudolph Steiner

308.28 --> 313.73999999999995
at first it's kind of annoying how

310.56 --> 316.94
meticulous he gets and like

313.74 --> 316.94
he's so

317.96 --> 324.59999999999997
preoccupied with analyzing and defend

321.479 --> 327.84
defending against gamma mindset

324.6 --> 329.22
it's that's what's really standing out

327.84 --> 333.11999999999995
to me

329.22 --> 337.86
because he's like overly protective like

333.12 --> 341.94
perhaps yeah people that'll read that

337.86 --> 344.699
are like deterred from getting

341.94 --> 346.919
hooked on individuals that he's

344.699 --> 350.24
typically describing that are basically

346.919 --> 350.24
there to dumb people down

350.639 --> 355.759
and he's using a lot of like referencing

353.699 --> 358.32
science Community

355.759 --> 360.36
right that's what I'm thinking he's a

358.32 --> 362.46
lot has a lot of references to like the

360.36 --> 364.259
Natural Sciences it was very funny that

362.46 --> 366.96
it just calls it Natural Sciences the

364.259 --> 369.02000000000004
way it's supposed to be but then starts

366.96 --> 371.75899999999996
to like dig into the complications

369.02 --> 373.58
psychologically of the people in that

371.759 --> 376.56
time

373.58 --> 378.84
that are the Arbiters of that that are

376.56 --> 381.32
in that field and are applying their way

378.84 --> 381.32
of thinking

382.02 --> 388.56
and it's just

384.12 --> 391.319
he's just describing with so much detail

388.56 --> 395.699
the spirit mechanics with so much detail

391.319 --> 398.52000000000004
that is just like holy [ __ ]

395.699 --> 403.46000000000004
but what's even weirder is that I just

398.52 --> 403.46
everything he says is like I remember it

403.68 --> 408.66
like I've read all of this before

405.66 --> 408.66
somehow

410.479 --> 414.84
and I'm almost like getting impatient

413.1 --> 415.74
with him it's just like get it on with

414.84 --> 418.02
like

415.74 --> 419.96000000000004
like there must be a more efficient way

418.02 --> 423.18
of saying all this

419.96 --> 425.28
but it is definitely worthy it is such

423.18 --> 426.78000000000003
an elaborate start study in the spirit

425.28 --> 429.0
mechanics

426.78 --> 432.539
which I call Spirit mechanics he call it

429.0 --> 434.759
Spirit Sciences well there's an extra

432.539 --> 437.34
dilemma with translating to Dutch with

434.759 --> 439.88
that so I wonder how they translated it

437.34 --> 439.88
in English

440.52 --> 446.21999999999997
right because it is a Dutch book

443.639 --> 450.06
but it's doable

446.22 --> 452.46000000000004
but also I'm just thinking a lot about

450.06 --> 454.44
like if you didn't know who this guy was

452.46 --> 457.68
and you'd be reading it thinking like

454.44 --> 459.96
this is like somebody of of this era

457.68 --> 463.74
then you'd be like yeah a little

459.96 --> 466.5
autistic very sharp but like he's just

463.74 --> 470.22
too preoccupied right but then when you

466.5 --> 473.22
realize that my God that no no that was

470.22 --> 474.47900000000004
a hundred years ago more than a hundred

473.22 --> 479.52000000000004
years ago

474.479 --> 483.599
then it just like holy [ __ ] like what a

479.52 --> 486.599
hot a hot idea a hot iron

483.599 --> 490.34
that he basically was pulling out with

486.599 --> 493.139
this in that era so like Mega

490.34 --> 495.17999999999995
Progressive but like actually

493.139 --> 498.78000000000003
Progressive

495.18 --> 501.3
like the based on the word progress he

498.78 --> 503.039
was making such a progress in trying to

501.3 --> 506.099
understand and figure things out and

503.039 --> 508.74
being so clear about it so detailed that

506.099 --> 511.8
was unheard of to have such cohesion

508.74 --> 514.32
with that because most people

511.8 --> 516.12
that were into that sort of stuff into

514.32 --> 518.899
Spirit things

516.12 --> 521.94
a lot of them ended up basically

518.899 --> 524.64
trickery Wizards

521.94 --> 526.5
just by the knowledge they stumbled upon

524.64 --> 527.76
and then basically getting seduced by

526.5 --> 529.5
that knowledge

527.76 --> 533.1
becoming it

529.5 --> 535.56
and then just yeah being distracted by

533.1 --> 539.22
it effectively right so hello Mike

535.56 --> 542.459
salunich first in chat good to see you

539.22 --> 545.12
yeah a little Steiner man

542.459 --> 545.1199999999999
heavy

548.94 --> 554.12
I can't yeah I am gonna finish this book

555.74 --> 564.62
I'm yeah it's not bad I mean

560.54 --> 564.62
I got pretty far I'd say

565.44 --> 567.86
like

573.72 --> 577.339
I need some chunk of it

577.48 --> 586.5600000000001
[Music]

583.08 --> 588.1800000000001
right I was also watching in between to

586.56 --> 591.3399999999999
basically wind down a bit because he

588.18 --> 592.92
just gets me so excited

591.34 --> 594.839
[Music]

592.92 --> 597.3
and I even yeah that's one of these

594.839 --> 599.1
issues that I remember from way back

597.3 --> 601.8599999999999
when being confronted with Rudolph

599.1 --> 604.5
Steiner work is that it just winds me up

601.86 --> 608.339
so much I get like so enthusiastic about

604.5 --> 611.339
it that it's like unhealthy

608.339 --> 613.1400000000001
but now that I'm older I'm much more

611.339 --> 615.899
capable of just dealing with that

613.14 --> 618.42
element of myself because that's not the

615.899 --> 619.68
book that's me responding like that it's

618.42 --> 621.5999999999999
just the book

619.68 --> 623.8199999999999
literally

621.6 --> 627.38
his Works in general but especially this

623.82 --> 629.6400000000001
book it's it's literally about Awakening

627.38 --> 633.54
literally about

629.64 --> 637.08
like gaining access to the higher levels

633.54 --> 639.779
of insight and he has like a mechanical

637.08 --> 644.1600000000001
system to describe it all

639.779 --> 646.88
very very detailed very careful

644.16 --> 646.88
incredible

647.579 --> 653.88
100.

649.2 --> 655.9200000000001
and like 120 years ago

653.88 --> 658.459
incredible

655.92 --> 658.459
right

659.16 --> 665.04
so my title today

661.98 --> 667.26
I don't exactly know where I don't

665.04 --> 669.959
remember where I

667.26 --> 672.8
picked that up that idea probably in the

669.959 --> 672.8
middle of my dream walking

673.26 --> 678.36
but it is basically a little trinket

676.26 --> 681.899
idea

678.36 --> 683.82
to address that well what like we're

681.899 --> 687.0
also constant continually being

683.82 --> 689.0400000000001
subjected by the idea of a reset

687.0 --> 691.079
it's almost like the

689.04 --> 692.88
computer culture right oh there's a

691.079 --> 694.38
problem just reset your computer have

692.88 --> 698.22
you tried turning it off and on again

694.38 --> 701.88
right but like this is

698.22 --> 703.98
this effect resets

701.88 --> 707.279
edit like it's being played down from

703.98 --> 709.32
the top the great reset all that [ __ ]

707.279 --> 714.42
right well

709.32 --> 719.779
I think it's actually a spirit mentality

714.42 --> 719.779
that comes from gross failure

721.079 --> 725.16
well

722.82 --> 729.839
if you actually

725.16 --> 732.42
like learn to just not do that

729.839 --> 735.3000000000001
like you will still make failures you

732.42 --> 738.4799999999999
will still make mistakes but if you

735.3 --> 742.8
learn to overcome them

738.48 --> 745.86
like and like prioritize that

742.8 --> 747.24
like even to any contemporary situation

745.86 --> 749.82
you might have

747.24 --> 751.8
that you prioritize learning from what

749.82 --> 754.32
is happening and adapting

751.8 --> 757.38
for yourself for your own personal

754.32 --> 761.339
ability range for example

757.38 --> 765.12
versus any like oh we gotta do this or

761.339 --> 766.44
else we'll lose something

765.12 --> 770.0
right

766.44 --> 773.5790000000001
so if you just hold on to that

770.0 --> 775.5
constructive Spirit spiritual high level

773.579 --> 779.7199999999999
state

775.5 --> 782.789
then you can literally bypass resets

779.72 --> 782.789
[Music]

784.38 --> 790.459
you will not get caught up in a state

787.26 --> 790.459
where you're continually

790.76 --> 795.36
basically making the same mistakes over

793.38 --> 798.0
and over again and that might not even

795.36 --> 800.839
be on an individual scale but unlike a

798.0 --> 800.839
family skill

803.1 --> 808.539
[Music]

809.459 --> 811.9399999999999
right

812.16 --> 819.66
so that's the idea behind the no reset

814.92 --> 821.9399999999999
state that the reset is a state of mind

819.66 --> 823.86
right all these people like uh when is

821.94 --> 826.9200000000001
it finally going to end uh

823.86 --> 828.9590000000001
or like oh Jesus Christ is coming the

826.92 --> 833.279
world's going to be destroyed

828.959 --> 835.3199999999999
right that's a reset mindset

833.279 --> 837.0
it's a reset state

835.32 --> 840.5400000000001
there

837.0 --> 842.519
at a dead end and they need a reset they

840.54 --> 844.62
don't know how to constructively

842.519 --> 846.54
continue from that position they long

844.62 --> 848.579
for a reset

846.54 --> 850.019
well that's a state of mind that's born

848.579 --> 853.62
out of

850.019 --> 856.68
failure like persistent failure

853.62 --> 859.8
like I can't handle this anymore

856.68 --> 863.4799999999999
why why are you not handling

859.8 --> 866.399
maybe you've actually overestimated

863.48 --> 868.38
yourself or maybe you caught up in

866.399 --> 871.26
something that pulled you outside of

868.38 --> 872.16
where you need to be and that's why

871.26 --> 875.1
you're not

872.16 --> 878.2199999999999
able to handle it right

875.1 --> 880.26
now if you avoid that you might avoid

878.22 --> 884.399
these times where you're just like

880.26 --> 886.74
staring at ariman death

884.399 --> 887.56
like oh we need a grade reset I can't

886.74 --> 889.38
handle it anymore

887.56 --> 893.3
[Music]

889.38 --> 893.3
you it's a state of mind

895.74 --> 900.6
the reset mindset

898.8 --> 901.8
[Music]

900.6 --> 903.839
I

901.8 --> 907.199
should change it to no reset mindset

903.839 --> 910.3800000000001
although that's too much set

907.199 --> 912.7199999999999
now I'll leave it like this

910.38 --> 914.959
but it's basically the no reset State of

912.72 --> 914.9590000000001
Mind

916.44 --> 922.8000000000001
yeah I'll add that so is anybody else in

919.92 --> 925.68
chat I'm talking here for 15 minutes I

922.8 --> 928.88
mean yeah it's great gravy as oh

925.68 --> 928.88
Benjamin would say but

929.339 --> 938.129
I mean hello

931.58 --> 938.129
[Music]

940.079 --> 945.4499999999999
oh wait

941.79 --> 945.4499999999999
[Music]

987.42 --> 992.8389999999999

1005.98 --> 1009.049
[Music]

1010.399 --> 1016.94
ah finally hey Susanna Walker

1014.55 --> 1019.459
[Music]

hello a man like me good to see you just

1021.98 --> 1028.9
got here okay okay

1023.48 --> 1028.9
where's the regular gang at I don't know

1032.179 --> 1036.22
maybe they had a heavy night or

1033.98 --> 1036.22
something

1037.579 --> 1043.6989999999998
I mean I had a relatively heavy night

1040.819 --> 1045.3799999999999
but you yeah I did go to bed

1043.699 --> 1048.559
like

1045.38 --> 1051.0800000000002
like basically well enough

1048.559 --> 1053.66
uh

1051.08 --> 1056.3799999999999
no yeah it's it's like getting really

1053.66 --> 1056.38
cold at night

1056.72 --> 1060.82
hey five roads it's you

1062.9 --> 1069.02
I'm having trouble with dominant

1065.98 --> 1072.38
personnet yeah dominant

1069.02 --> 1074.48
but you mean you

1072.38 --> 1078.88
or somebody else

1074.48 --> 1078.88
having a dominant personality Susanna

1090.86 --> 1096.26
oh by the way

1093.559 --> 1097.94
I was yesterday also watching and

1096.26 --> 1103.48
finishing

1097.94 --> 1103.48
the 1899 series on Netflix

1103.64 --> 1109.4
and that

1106.46 --> 1112.039
was not exactly what I expected and

1109.4 --> 1113.8400000000001
that's like

1112.039 --> 1116.96
impressive

1113.84 --> 1120.5
impressive twist

1116.96 --> 1121.88
like seriously I like did not see that

1120.5 --> 1124.24
coming

1121.88 --> 1126.74
there's like an entire weird

1124.24 --> 1129.38
transformation happening during the

1126.74 --> 1132.38
entire series from beginning to end it's

1129.38 --> 1134.2990000000002
very linear in its build and like it

1132.38 --> 1136.64
doesn't tell you

1134.299 --> 1137.72
that it's happening you're just seeing

1136.64 --> 1140.1200000000001
things

1137.72 --> 1143.179
and everybody's in character naturally

1140.12 --> 1145.1599999999999
responding and then like event it gets

1143.179 --> 1149.3600000000001
really surreal

1145.16 --> 1152.66
I'm very impressed and it's

1149.36 --> 1156.8799999999999
yeah I'm trying not to spoiled twist at

1152.66 --> 1160.28
the end but like holy [ __ ]

1156.88 --> 1162.14
did somebody listen to one of my shows a

1160.28 --> 1164.48
few years ago

1162.14 --> 1167.2990000000002
because this sounds like in science

1164.48 --> 1169.96
fiction idea that I actually had and

1167.299 --> 1169.96
described

1172.34 --> 1176.1399999999999
like holy [ __ ]

1177.02 --> 1181.94
like that the end twist was like

1179.78 --> 1185.059
whoa

1181.94 --> 1188.539
I mean that's

1185.059 --> 1189.799
kindness sort of partially what I had in

1188.539 --> 1192.44
mind

1189.799 --> 1195.679
this is really weird to just suddenly

1192.44 --> 1197.9
see that appear like what

1195.679 --> 1200.72
whoa

1197.9 --> 1203.66
also they had really funny and

1200.72 --> 1205.88
interesting play with a lot of symbology

1203.66 --> 1208.039
that made me think that they're also

1205.88 --> 1210.5590000000002
listening to Mac from Quantum conscious

1208.039 --> 1216.58
so yeah Matt

1210.559 --> 1216.58
is gonna review this show I guarantee it

1216.62 --> 1221.6
because they they almost literally like

1219.2 --> 1226.1200000000001
have his catchphrase quote

1221.6 --> 1226.12
like this isn't real like

1226.88 --> 1231.0390000000002
this can't be real like they literally

1229.46 --> 1235.3400000000001
say that

1231.039 --> 1237.919
isn't that it's amazing like oh yeah I'm

1235.34 --> 1240.02
loving it except for the gay [ __ ] even

1237.919 --> 1243.64
though the gay relationships were

1240.02 --> 1243.6399999999999
actually kind of like

1244.52 --> 1250.039
well done

1247.12 --> 1252.5
I hate it but

1250.039 --> 1254.799
yeah

1252.5 --> 1257.6
I mean

1254.799 --> 1261.26
and then with the end twist it gets

1257.6 --> 1264.1999999999998
really weird not really gay but really

1261.26 --> 1267.3799999999999
weird so it yeah it's not about like

1264.2 --> 1269.8600000000001
it's it's less of a gay Invasion as like

1267.38 --> 1269.8600000000001
uh

1270.02 --> 1275.12
as the Sandman is

1272.6 --> 1277.58
because that is like very gay very

1275.12 --> 1280.34
flaming in your face and like gay

1277.58 --> 1282.6789999999999
seductions continually with this it's

1280.34 --> 1285.02
not really like that but there is

1282.679 --> 1287.0800000000002
definitely gay in it

1285.02 --> 1289.0
but

1287.08 --> 1292.52
develop

1289.0 --> 1295.4
relatively interesting I guess I don't

1292.52 --> 1297.62
know it's weird to say that because I'm

1295.4 --> 1302.919
technically not interested but I've seen

1297.62 --> 1302.9189999999999
worse displays of gay story development

1303.799 --> 1307.6399999999999
anyway

1305.24 --> 1309.559
I'm very impressed with the series and I

1307.64 --> 1314.26
bet that Matt from corner of conscious

1309.559 --> 1314.26
is gonna review it he definitely should

1321.62 --> 1324.2199999999998
right

1329.12 --> 1335.6589999999999
you meant the other no no well Susanna

1331.94 --> 1338.8400000000001
you don't seem to be displaying any dump

1335.659 --> 1341.419
typically dominant traits

1338.84 --> 1344.26
like that

1341.419 --> 1344.26
so far

1354.52 --> 1361.039
what that's brought it into the daylight

1359.419 --> 1364.1200000000001
then what

1361.039 --> 1364.12
what are you talking about

1379.24 --> 1384.559
right but anyway uh I hope the dominant

1382.7 --> 1386.419
personality isn't me you're having

1384.559 --> 1389.36
trouble with

1386.419 --> 1391.159
the robots oh you did oh

1389.36 --> 1392.78
okay

1391.159 --> 1395.24
I didn't think you were like into

1392.78 --> 1398.72
Transformer that's usually like a very

1395.24 --> 1402.039
much a boy thing but okay

1398.72 --> 1402.039
what do you think about it

1402.44 --> 1406.419
I did not expect you to watch that

1407.38 --> 1412.0200000000002
[Music]

1409.159 --> 1423.75
but yeah

1412.02 --> 1423.75
[Music]

1428.6 --> 1434.4189999999999
right but maybe you just watched it as a

1431.0 --> 1435.2
study of media and not for nostalgia's

1434.419 --> 1439.72
sake

1435.2 --> 1439.72
which for me is the reason definitely

1440.36 --> 1445.4799999999998
very technical interesting timeline yeah

1447.02 --> 1452.72
well somebody made a lot of effort to

1449.24 --> 1456.08
try and to make the puzzle fit with it

1452.72 --> 1458.419
which by the way is very untypical for

1456.08 --> 1461.799
Transformers it's like the original G1

1458.419 --> 1465.2
series was messy as [ __ ]

1461.799 --> 1467.96
which by the way is universally like an

1465.2 --> 1470.96
issue with most cartoons from that era

1467.96 --> 1473.3600000000001
and even series

1470.96 --> 1475.6000000000001
but yeah they made a real effort like

1473.36 --> 1478.3999999999999
with the entire thing like somebody

1475.6 --> 1482.74
pre-wrote like the entire thing they

1478.4 --> 1482.74
would have had to and it's interesting

1483.22 --> 1488.26
[Music]

1485.72 --> 1488.26
right

1490.22 --> 1495.14
right and it gets even more interesting

1492.08 --> 1498.5
if you really know like the old G1

1495.14 --> 1502.159
Transformer series and the movie

1498.5 --> 1504.679
right because they reflect so much upon

1502.159 --> 1507.5200000000002
the Lord that was all brought out in

1504.679 --> 1510.2
that movie especially and in the series

1507.52 --> 1511.76
even things that they brought out in the

1510.2 --> 1514.1000000000001
series that they barely even address

1511.76 --> 1515.0
it's like well this amazing Concepts

1514.1 --> 1517.6399999999999
like

1515.0 --> 1521.539
the all-spark right

1517.64 --> 1524.2990000000002
like but they don't really do anything

1521.539 --> 1526.7
with it in that series well in here well

1524.299 --> 1529.039
they built it they built that thing out

1526.7 --> 1530.179
of it and that's really what it felt

1529.039 --> 1532.72
like to me

1530.179 --> 1535.94
like they yeah

1532.72 --> 1540.14
[Music]

1535.94 --> 1543.44
and actually taking it serious

1540.14 --> 1545.96
the spirit of it and yeah nothing like

1543.44 --> 1548.799
what like Michael Bay did with his

1545.96 --> 1548.799
nonsense

1549.44 --> 1556.19
right anyway

1551.45 --> 1556.19
[Music]

1557.12 --> 1564.34
but did you watch the entire thing

1560.24 --> 1564.34
that's a lot

1564.5 --> 1572.2
I mean that's like 30 episodes of like

1568.46 --> 1572.2
was it 40 minutes each

1573.42 --> 1578.299
[Music]

1576.5 --> 1581.11
huh

1578.299 --> 1583.46
I guess you binged watched it

1581.11 --> 1585.9399999999998
[Music]

1583.46 --> 1585.94
anyway

1586.159 --> 1591.14
hello everybody I see everybody's like

1588.5 --> 1593.6
super chatty in chat because it's just

1591.14 --> 1596.2990000000002
booming I mean like five min five

1593.6 --> 1598.039
messages every second or something look

1596.299 --> 1599.539
at that

1598.039 --> 1602.36
just

1599.539 --> 1603.31
keeps on rolling and rolling and rolling

1602.36 --> 1606.26
and incredible

1603.31 --> 1609.3799999999999
[Music]

1606.26 --> 1611.3799999999999
I must have the busiest live chat in the

1609.38 --> 1614.8990000000001
entirety of YouTube

1611.38 --> 1614.8990000000001
[Music]

1616.46 --> 1621.46
oh and I'm being sarcastic here for the

1619.279 --> 1621.46
record

1622.7 --> 1628.76
I mean the pretty evident but uh

1626.659 --> 1631.6000000000001
oh hello Tony Whitcomb

1628.76 --> 1631.6
it's you

1635.179 --> 1637.72
right

1638.84 --> 1644.539
Saturday that's why

1641.779 --> 1646.64
but usually on Saturday a lot of people

1644.539 --> 1649.76
like it's an hour later

1646.64 --> 1652.7
and a lot of people are actually usually

1649.76 --> 1654.919
quite relaxed on Saturday

1652.7 --> 1656.1200000000001
which means that they're much more

1654.919 --> 1657.38
chatty

1656.12 --> 1660.9799999999998
anyway

1657.38 --> 1663.38
maybe uh it's gonna turn around

1660.98 --> 1666.919
people have been bad for saying good

1663.38 --> 1669.46
afternoon no no they haven't

1666.919 --> 1673.72
except if they have really

1669.46 --> 1673.72
disgusting stupid troll names

1677.059 --> 1682.84
or are blatantly a sock of somebody else

1693.62 --> 1699.7399999999998
right but they have banned people for

1696.62 --> 1701.059
complaining about me Banning people that

1699.74 --> 1703.39
has happened

1701.059 --> 1716.66
so you're in thin ice buddy

1703.39 --> 1716.66
[Music]

1717.64 --> 1721.779
yeah well Tony Wickham I just talked

1720.5 --> 1723.679
about it

1721.779 --> 1726.46
I just finished

1723.679 --> 1726.46
thinking about it

1728.059 --> 1733.76
yes I have seen good things in the last

1732.02 --> 1737.6
couple of days

1733.76 --> 1737.6
been watching 1899

1738.159 --> 1743.6000000000001
very interesting

1740.6 --> 1743.6
mystery

1745.94 --> 1751.159
yeah

1747.08 --> 1755.48
melange of like historical

1751.159 --> 1757.88
Gothic mystery and just like it gets it

1755.48 --> 1760.94
it's like has a mega twist

1757.88 --> 1763.8200000000002
which I I will not spoil

1760.94 --> 1766.3990000000001
but yeah I told when I started it up I

1763.82 --> 1767.96
just completely had an idea of like oh

1766.399 --> 1772.399
no they're gonna do something like that

1767.96 --> 1774.14
and then it's like what oh [ __ ]

1772.399 --> 1776.6589999999999
okay

1774.14 --> 1779.8990000000001
that's

1776.659 --> 1782.3600000000001
I it made me feel like I was trapped

1779.899 --> 1784.82
there for a second

1782.36 --> 1786.62
but yeah that I'm not gonna elaborate on

1784.82 --> 1789.26
that you'll have to like watch it

1786.62 --> 1791.779
through it to the end to get what

1789.26 --> 1795.46
what that feeling was about how I

1791.779 --> 1795.46
misized it up for being like a

1797.12 --> 1803.02
no I'm not gonna say anymore it's it's

1799.22 --> 1803.02
an interesting series on Netflix

1806.26 --> 1811.8799999999999
immediately hostility no no no no it's

1810.02 --> 1815.96
immediately

1811.88 --> 1818.6000000000001
starting out with the first sentence

1815.96 --> 1822.799
complaining

1818.6 --> 1825.039
and then the second sentence complaining

1822.799 --> 1825.039
to

1826.46 --> 1832.8990000000001
still on thin ice I mean that ice is not

1828.86 --> 1832.899
going to grow any thicker like this

1834.77 --> 1837.97
[Music]

1838.82 --> 1843.26
are we just walked in right now no I'm

1841.279 --> 1846.22
here

1843.26 --> 1849.679
or you mean yourself

1846.22 --> 1852.159
which requires a comma

1849.679 --> 1856.419
or I

1852.159 --> 1856.419
but yeah I get your point

1856.82 --> 1862.76
yeah okay you can [ __ ] off now bye bye

1860.6 --> 1865.399
numpty [ __ ]

1862.76 --> 1868.64

1865.399 --> 1870.9189999999999
don't care I don't care about your

1868.64 --> 1873.679
whining about how I do my show I'm gonna

1873.679 --> 1878.2
way I want it and nothing's gonna stop

1875.899 --> 1878.1999999999998
me

1882.98 --> 1891.27
[Music]

1891.34 --> 1895.1599999999999
no no no

1893.44 --> 1898.239
are you kidding me

1895.16 --> 1898.239
[Music]

1900.86 --> 1904.059
it's the whining dick

1906.5 --> 1914.539
right but yeah anyway I yeah watched

1911.14 --> 1917.48
1899 interesting series

1914.539 --> 1920.179
I definitely think that uh Quantum of

1917.48 --> 1923.0
conscious is going to review it

1920.179 --> 1926.38
like he really kind of has to because

1923.0 --> 1929.44
they seem to have been fans of his and

1926.38 --> 1933.46
well used quotes

1929.44 --> 1933.46
of his catchphrases

1937.779 --> 1946.039
and it is awesome I mean there's like

1942.559 --> 1948.98
very early on not not exactly like the

1946.039 --> 1951.74
first episode I'm not sure

1948.98 --> 1953.84
but like early on like really awesome

1951.74 --> 1956.84
like

1953.84 --> 1958.6399999999999
what yeah awesome surreal [ __ ] happens

1956.84 --> 1960.32
like

1958.64 --> 1962.1100000000001
like real

1960.32 --> 1968.6499999999999
awesome I liked it

1962.11 --> 1968.6499999999999
[Music]

1970.82 --> 1978.74
right and yeah in a way also it has a

1974.24 --> 1982.039
slight just a slight feel very slight of

1978.74 --> 1983.24
like the uh stranger things

1982.039 --> 1984.98
like

1983.24 --> 1988.88
surrealness

1984.98 --> 1992.0
slightly but it's nothing like that

1988.88 --> 1994.22
but it's just like it it gives me the

1992.0 --> 1995.84
same kind of like ooh similar

1994.22 --> 1998.8990000000001
interesting ideas

1995.84 --> 2002.1999999999998
so yeah

1998.899 --> 2005.76
probably better I mean a stranger things

2002.2 --> 2005.76
is like yeah much more

2006.58 --> 2012.82
much more Gravely in ways typical much

2010.12 --> 2017.7399999999998
more holy Woody but still pretty okay

2012.82 --> 2020.2
but yeah this series is like really

2017.74 --> 2022.179
German

2020.2 --> 2023.799
even though it's multi-language and

2022.179 --> 2027.8200000000002
that's also very interesting that's

2023.799 --> 2032.62
actually multi-language they continually

2027.82 --> 2034.0
it's like French Italian

2032.62 --> 2036.039
German

2034.0 --> 2040.14
English

2036.039 --> 2040.14
uh Chinese

2040.65 --> 2046.24
[Music]

2042.96 --> 2049.78
oh Chinese who's trying to be a Japanese

2046.24 --> 2052.179
by the way which is like what this is so

2049.78 --> 2053.98
it's like super multilingual

2052.179 --> 2055.899
and

2053.98 --> 2057.94
it's interesting because there's also

2055.899 --> 2061.1189999999997
like a pretty careful Dynamic of like

2057.94 --> 2064.3
who understands what language and that

2061.119 --> 2067.2400000000002
they actually seem to be learning more

2064.3 --> 2069.94
language like understanding other

2067.24 --> 2071.7999999999997
people's language as they go naturally

2069.94 --> 2073.599
so there's like all kinds of interesting

2071.8 --> 2075.52
character development learning curves

2073.599 --> 2080.099
that are just naturally baked into this

2075.52 --> 2080.099
thing I mean it's it's very interesting

2082.659 --> 2086.26
one of conscious is mentioned every

2084.399 --> 2090.5989999999997
field yeah of course

2086.26 --> 2090.599
he's just not really focused on that

2090.76 --> 2095.28
he's much more focused on this ain't

2092.98 --> 2095.28
real

2095.679 --> 2101.369
right

2098.11 --> 2101.369

2128.079 --> 2131.079
what

2140.2 --> 2143.5789999999997
what does that mean

2145.18 --> 2149.56
what you don't watch Quantum of

2147.28 --> 2151.9
conscious because he mentioned Effie a

2149.56 --> 2156.22
few times how does that that combination

2151.9 --> 2159.42
of text make any sense Tony Whitcomb

2156.22 --> 2159.4199999999996

2176.74 --> 2181.18
I mean is this just me or does that make

2231.099 --> 2237.7000000000003
you can't buy it on DVD

2235.24 --> 2240.54
you might be able to download a rip of

2237.7 --> 2240.54

and I just don't get it

2245.32 --> 2249.48

that film but are you talking about that

2275.859 --> 2280.42
weird film from Williams

2278.92 --> 2283.66
uh

2280.42 --> 2285.46
from Serbia or something Serbia is that

2283.66 --> 2288.7799999999997
what you're talking because you're not

2298.06 --> 2305.32
[Music]

2307.54 --> 2311.2
I don't want to be a dick but are you

something because you just

2312.94 --> 2317.38
this is not communicating

2321.4 --> 2324.599
what's going on here

2325.0 --> 2330.06
or maybe you just have like a dreary day

2327.099 --> 2330.06
because just

2335.8 --> 2338.88
like by accident

2340.76 --> 2343.96
[Music]

2341.92 --> 2348.06
right but okay

2343.96 --> 2348.06

2410.26 --> 2414.0400000000004
mentioned rement blueberry are you

2412.06 --> 2417.359
talking about blueberry because that is

2414.04 --> 2417.359
absolutely a great film

2425.2 --> 2430.96
that texting is not so easy all right

2428.32 --> 2433.2000000000003
yeah that's why I don't do that on the

2430.96 --> 2437.46
telephone that's why I use a keyboard

2433.2 --> 2437.46
because I don't want to torture myself

2441.88 --> 2446.859
blueberry right

2444.16 --> 2449.5
yeah if anybody wants to download that

2446.859 --> 2453.339
blueberry with the proper titles the

2449.5 --> 2456.7
subtitles contact me

2453.339 --> 2459.64
through email I will send you the

2456.7 --> 2463.18

so yeah if you want that email me

2496.72 --> 2500.3199999999997
you're talking about blueberry let me

2498.52 --> 2503.88
re-read this

2500.32 --> 2503.88
and see if it now makes sense

2505.66 --> 2512.3199999999997
purchase the film

2507.52 --> 2515.2
uh absorbs all the way well that depends

2512.32 --> 2517.48
you know with the blueberry DVD I don't

2515.2 --> 2521.14
know

2517.48 --> 2526.18
I have a version

2521.14 --> 2530.16
that like has Dutch subtitles that's my

2526.18 --> 2530.16
DVD it's had Dutch subtitles

2531.88 --> 2538.7400000000002
I'm not sure anymore if it has English

2533.92 --> 2538.7400000000002
subtitles so yeah I don't know

2541.48 --> 2548.02
but I have

2543.579 --> 2551.2000000000003
a well a rip

2548.02 --> 2553.839
of the movie with English subtitles

2551.2 --> 2554.99
baked into it

2553.839 --> 2557.74
right anyway hey

2554.99 --> 2559.7799999999997
[Music]

2557.74 --> 2560.14
Robert guns are never around good to see

2559.78 --> 2568.9500000000003
you

2560.14 --> 2568.95
[Music]

2578.74 --> 2581.74
okay

2588.88 --> 2594.1800000000003
yeah sure Robert

2591.579 --> 2594.1800000000003
what

2594.579 --> 2598.119
this what are you saying there's some

2596.26 --> 2599.5
kind of a Mandela effect going on or

2598.119 --> 2601.78
something

2599.5 --> 2604.619
that the engines because I don't know

2601.78 --> 2604.619
what you're talking about

2613.18 --> 2617.64
the engines are in front now

2619.42 --> 2622.2000000000003
okay

2623.81 --> 2631.92
[Music]

2628.06 --> 2631.92
it's probably a Mandela effect

2639.64 --> 2645.0
right geez what's happening with my

2642.16 --> 2645.0
voice damn it

2647.7 --> 2652.7799999999997
but look how Mandela effect usually

2650.319 --> 2655.8
happen it's psychological it always is

2652.78 --> 2655.8
no exception

2655.96 --> 2662.619
is that you basically mixed up memories

2660.04 --> 2663.64
right just like with the lion and the

2662.619 --> 2667.1800000000003
lamb

2663.64 --> 2670.54
there's a mix up with a popular song

2667.18 --> 2672.16
that was really like spread around

2670.54 --> 2675.88
and you

2672.16 --> 2677.98
cross mix it mix them up right so you

2675.88 --> 2680.319
probably saw

2677.98 --> 2681.3
while those types of planes with the

2680.319 --> 2682.96
engines

2681.3 --> 2686.38
[Music]

2682.96 --> 2690.339
where you say under the wings

2686.38 --> 2693.2200000000003
but not with that one so usually it's

2690.339 --> 2695.2
like they show you an exception and then

2693.22 --> 2696.9399999999996
in your mind you don't remember that it

2695.2 --> 2701.14
is an exception and you just remember

2696.94 --> 2705.359
the more Universal way of that object as

2701.14 --> 2705.359
you are confronted with it you see

2706.839 --> 2710.16
that's the Mandela effect

2711.04 --> 2718.42
Mandela effect typically makes you not

2714.28 --> 2720.76
remember something was an exception

2718.42 --> 2724.8
it's basically a form of

2720.76 --> 2724.8
subconscious over generalization

2734.73 --> 2741.54
[Music]

2737.56 --> 2741.54
right well maybe they are

2742.119 --> 2744.3
thank you

2752.68 --> 2757.8999999999996
I don't know what to say dude

2755.5 --> 2761.68
I have not flown

2757.9 --> 2764.079
in airplanes so

2761.68 --> 2767.3999999999996
except when when I was a baby I don't

2764.079 --> 2767.4
have memories of that of course

2769.96 --> 2774.52
engineering yeah that well that seems

2772.06 --> 2776.44
logical that they just simply figure out

2774.52 --> 2779.22
like oh it's more efficient to put the

2776.44 --> 2779.2200000000003
engines over there

2782.579 --> 2789.28
that could be it but if you're saying

2786.04 --> 2792.04
like oh no it's like been retrofitted

2789.28 --> 2795.1800000000003
with older series

2792.04 --> 2795.18
now that is weird

2795.76 --> 2799.2000000000003
that is actually weird

2806.52 --> 2810.599
I don't know how to explain that

2811.079 --> 2816.579
except maybe they just took the liberty

2813.76 --> 2818.5600000000004
to basically take out what it would be

2816.579 --> 2821.079
typical type stock footage like an

2818.56 --> 2824.14
airplane right oh he's going by the

2821.079 --> 2826.7200000000003
plane well that's not really integral to

2824.14 --> 2828.7599999999998
the series usually or whatever it's just

2826.72 --> 2831.16
stock footage well yeah

2828.76 --> 2834.94
the company owner

2831.16 --> 2837.64
of that footage way after the fact like

2834.94 --> 2840.3
half a century later or whatever

2837.64 --> 2842.6189999999997
yeah they can

2840.3 --> 2845.38
potentially make a decision to start

2842.619 --> 2848.2000000000003
altering some of that stock footage so

2845.38 --> 2850.599
like update it to the newer models or

2848.2 --> 2852.5789999999997
whatever for advertisement and they

2850.599 --> 2855.54
wouldn't even have to tell you

2852.579 --> 2855.54
necessarily

2856.119 --> 2862.78
right I mean yeah what's the stop

2860.44 --> 2865.3
other movie companies from basically

2862.78 --> 2869.26
pulling a George Lucas like what he did

2865.3 --> 2871.8390000000004
with this silly Star Wars CGI updates

2869.26 --> 2873.8190000000004
right what's the stop the others from

2871.839 --> 2876.0
doing that

2873.819 --> 2876.0
thank you

2891.94 --> 2895.28
[Music]

2902.46 --> 2907.9
I don't know what you're talking about

2905.079 --> 2911.1400000000003
but look

2907.9 --> 2916.079
if it's all just different now that

2911.14 --> 2916.0789999999997
means it's just different engineering

2920.56 --> 2924.7
I mean yeah engineering updates like oh

2922.839 --> 2927.4
yeah they figure it out it's like 20

2924.7 --> 2929.98
more efficient if you put it there or

2927.4 --> 2932.26
it's like oh with this new way of

2929.98 --> 2934.06
building the engine it's actually more

2932.26 --> 2935.98
efficient to place it over there because

2934.06 --> 2939.04
then they write that very specific

2935.98 --> 2940.599
turbulent Point blah blah blah blah you

2939.04 --> 2942.87
know it's like yeah this is called

2940.599 --> 2946.07
engineering changes that happens

2942.87 --> 2946.0699999999997
[Music]

2946.66 --> 2950.5
different engines now right well maybe

2949.599 --> 2953.619
they

2950.5 --> 2955.24
remember this vacuum Drive engines that

2953.619 --> 2956.859
they basically have well maybe they

2955.24 --> 2959.2
figure it out in even more efficient

2956.859 --> 2961.98
version of that

who knows

2962.92 --> 2967.29

2976.9 --> 2981.28
if you actually want to know with

2979.119 --> 2983.98
absolute certainty

2981.28 --> 2987.8190000000004
that there is like vetted retroactively

2983.98 --> 2990.4
changed and find freaking postcards

2987.819 --> 2993.94
that are literally like dated to that

2990.4 --> 2995.5
time like find physical stuff or

2993.94 --> 2997.96
footage

2995.5 --> 3001.68
and then analyze it with Photoshop if it

2997.96 --> 3004.64
hasn't been altered

3001.68 --> 3004.64
in any way

3009.18 --> 3011.7799999999997
oh

3024.3 --> 3028.7400000000002
they're just making a topic to talk I

3026.28 --> 3031.98
know and I'm talking about it

3028.74 --> 3034.14
but you had a concern about it

3031.98 --> 3036.54
and I'm just giving you the leads pretty

3034.14 --> 3039.44
much like yeah this is how you figure

3036.54 --> 3039.44
out what's going on

here

3116.099 --> 3123.0
thank you

3118.819 --> 3125.359
used since 1958 it has the engines on

3123.0 --> 3125.359
the side

3127.92 --> 3130.94
not in front

3141.3 --> 3144.8
which one were you talking about

3149.28 --> 3154.6400000000003
yeah seven four seven oh seven four

3151.859 --> 3154.64
seven hold on

3159.92 --> 3165.359
okay I don't know what stock footage

3163.14 --> 3168.7799999999997
you're looking at but

3165.359 --> 3171.7799999999997
these photographs all seem

3168.78 --> 3173.52
like the the usual

3171.78 --> 3176.3590000000004
I have no idea what you're talking about

3173.52 --> 3176.359
guns and everyone

3183.059 --> 3185.599
foreign

3198.18 --> 3201.74
it's just the same old

3238.14 --> 3241.319
I don't know what you're talking about

3239.64 --> 3243.66
but everything I showed right there

3241.319 --> 3246.359
that's just like yeah that's how we use

3243.66 --> 3249.7799999999997
that's how it looks

3246.359 --> 3252.48
look at your yeah no how about

3249.78 --> 3256.02
I'm just not gonna take your little icon

3252.48 --> 3260.22
which is barely visible anyway

3256.02 --> 3263.46
and I just take the well

3260.22 --> 3267.18
the actual just regular pictures out

3263.46 --> 3269.819
there of Boeing 747

3267.18 --> 3272.4199999999996
and looks perfectly normal like I

3269.819 --> 3272.42
remember it

3274.8 --> 3278.7000000000003
maybe it's the wing that was complete

3276.66 --> 3281.3999999999996
yeah or maybe he just had some weird

3278.7 --> 3285.0
Photoshop batch

3281.4 --> 3287.339
yeah you gotta check your sources

3285.0 --> 3290.599
right anyway I'm gonna take a two minute

3287.339 --> 3290.599
break after you heard back

3303.24 --> 3306.02
you know

3345.42 --> 3347.66
foreign

3388.04 --> 3391.64
and the back

3406.14 --> 3412.2799999999997
look up a movie

3409.5 --> 3412.28
okay

3414.96 --> 3423.059
so could it be that the movie didn't

3418.98 --> 3427.02
just use an original specimen

3423.059 --> 3428.7000000000003
that they built a modification that it's

3427.02 --> 3430.5
just like no as long as it looks

3428.7 --> 3433.6189999999997
somewhat close I mean

3430.5 --> 3436.8
it's like a state a lot of movies just

3433.619 --> 3438.839
use stage props

3436.8 --> 3442.1400000000003
foreign

3438.839 --> 3444.48
for such scenes so

3442.14 --> 3445.98
I don't know man I mean if your source

3444.48 --> 3448.079
is like but it's different in the movies

3445.98 --> 3452.96
then yeah well maybe the movie just had

3448.079 --> 3452.96
a modification then I mean it's a movie

3455.04 --> 3462.079
it was probably again I ever Resort back

3458.04 --> 3462.079
to my original argument here

3462.24 --> 3467.7
and that is like yeah oh no they were

3465.119 --> 3469.44
been the exception if you saw something

3467.7 --> 3471.72
in a movie it's like yeah but they have

3469.44 --> 3473.76
they changed it no then it was always

3471.72 --> 3475.3799999999997
changed and you just didn't pick up on

3473.76 --> 3478.38
it

3475.38 --> 3478.38
foreign

3482.24 --> 3486.7999999999997
is the movies yeah

3487.8 --> 3492.42
I mean movies are not exactly known to

3490.98 --> 3494.76
be

3492.42 --> 3497.66
like technically or historically

3494.76 --> 3497.6600000000003
accurate

3502.26 --> 3506.0
I mean it's just the movies

3506.76 --> 3509.76

3511.26 --> 3514.8
yeah I'm not gonna play a clip of that

3513.48 --> 3518.119

anytime that [ __ ] kind of bumps into

4028.46 --> 4033.2
your face a lot of people tend to get

4030.5 --> 4036.14
really distracted by it so I guess it

4033.2 --> 4038.5989999999997
just serves a function

4036.14 --> 4040.52
maybe Mandela effecting is like

4038.599 --> 4041.539
something they can just do it's just

4040.52 --> 4045.14
like oh

4041.539 --> 4048.5
they have a library of typical Mandela

4045.14 --> 4051.14
effects that they anticipate and then

4048.5 --> 4053.72
the algorithm can just like oh now shove

4051.14 --> 4057.46
this thing in specifically that person's

4053.72 --> 4057.4599999999996

4058.64 --> 4064.16
that that's what they that's what it

4060.619 --> 4066.619
might be it might be pure mind control

4064.16 --> 4069.859
it does feel like that to me because

4066.619 --> 4073.099
I've never had any productive result out

4095.839 --> 4099.92

4097.88 --> 4102.259
about it it's one of the things that

4099.92 --> 4105.14
makes it so Mandela effect is that it

4102.259 --> 4108.62
never actually matters it's like every

4105.14 --> 4111.7390000000005

stop whining about [ __ ] that's like

ears

4170.42 --> 4174.46
hanging over the tail

4174.5 --> 4179.179
so that it would seem a lot of the time

4176.96 --> 4180.92
like he had a black tip tail but he

4179.179 --> 4184.42
didn't

4180.92 --> 4184.42
Mandela effect anyway

4186.799 --> 4189.699
what's that

4200.42 --> 4203.14
whoa

4203.36 --> 4206.139999999999
what the

4208.16 --> 4216.28
what the hell was one going up

4212.54 --> 4216.28
but yeah that is weird

4216.44 --> 4220.82
interesting

4218.42 --> 4222.56
it's funny that you can even see the

4220.82 --> 4224.78

4222.56 --> 4227.7390000000005
smoke remnant

4224.78 --> 4227.739
How Bizarre

4231.8 --> 4236.2390000000005

4233.9 --> 4237.62
mean that does definitely look to me

4236.239 --> 4241.639999999999
like

4237.62 --> 4246.14
uh what I described was it two three

4241.64 --> 4248.12
days ago about how sediment on the

4246.14 --> 4249.26
firmament not the freaking firm in

4248.12 --> 4252.26
itself

4249.26 --> 4254.4800000000005
might be breaking off under some

4252.26 --> 4257.84
electrical situation and literally just

4254.48 --> 4261.218999999999
be like the the bang and then bolt off

4257.84 --> 4261.219
at a credible speed

4262.34 --> 4268.9400000000005
well that definitely looks like it but

4264.98 --> 4271.659
the one going up what I don't know how

4268.94 --> 4271.659
to explain that

4276.5 --> 4280.82
I mean I

4278.54 --> 4282.98
unless there was some kind of weird

4280.82 --> 4285.5599999999995
electrical effect or so I don't know

4282.98 --> 4288.86
that that was weird interesting footage

4285.56 --> 4291.620000000001
thanks for sharing that Adam Lincoln

4288.86 --> 4295.0
I think I'm actually gonna play that

4291.62 --> 4295.0
it's definitely worth sharing

4302.0 --> 4304.78
foreign

4308.12 --> 4311.26
here we go

4322.88 --> 4327.28
yeah that's pretty amazing

4327.739 --> 4332.0
especially like that it leaves that that

4330.32 --> 4334.84
smoke Trail

4332.0 --> 4334.84
look at that

4343.82 --> 4348.199
I mean that's literally a smoke Trail

4345.92 --> 4350.659
there's no doubt that that is a physical

4348.199 --> 4352.28
thing that just happened there

4350.659 --> 4353.839999999999
you literally you could literally even

4352.28 --> 4356.12
see the smoke

4353.84 --> 4357.92
like being blown apart

4356.12 --> 4360.199
by the wind

4357.92 --> 4364.82
like as you would see

4360.199 --> 4366.08
uh Trails behind airplanes that are

4364.82 --> 4368.42
persistent

4366.08 --> 4372.0199999999995
as you would see them

4368.42 --> 4375.9400000000005
getting like blown apart

4372.02 --> 4375.9400000000005
well that was this

4376.159 --> 4379.239
very interesting

4384.44 --> 4389.719
I know not on the right side yeah

4387.32 --> 4391.84
but like that thing on the right side is

4389.719 --> 4394.94
just the complete mystery to me I mean

4391.84 --> 4397.219
upward like what

4394.94 --> 4400.58
I mean I'd be inclined to just think

4397.219 --> 4401.9
like it's something electrical then

4400.58 --> 4404.179
I mean

4401.9 --> 4406.54
how else could something like that even

4404.179 --> 4406.54
happen

4406.76 --> 4412.52
with something that's like a physical

4408.8 --> 4414.02
object moving in space I don't get it I

4412.52 --> 4415.040000000001
don't know I don't understand what that

4414.02 --> 4417.679
was

4415.04 --> 4419.26
really weird

4417.679 --> 4422.659
I mean I don't think you could even

4419.26 --> 4425.84
technically even really explain that

4422.659 --> 4430.0
through heliocentric ideas of meteors I

4425.84 --> 4430.0
mean meteors don't shoot up

4432.62 --> 4438.44
it's not like oh no it's coming from the

4434.9 --> 4440.659
distance towards no that thing just went

4438.44 --> 4444.739
up

4440.659 --> 4446.92
not like from the distance towards us at

4444.739 --> 4446.919999999999
all

4447.26 --> 4452.9800000000005
reflect no

4449.6 --> 4452.9800000000005
nothing is reflecting

4457.699 --> 4461.739
there's no reflection of anything

4459.26 --> 4461.7390000000005
physical

4473.36 --> 4476.36
foreign

4495.1 --> 4500.08
side physical like the left I cannot say

4504.44 --> 4509.299999999999
that thing the the Let the Right One

4507.08 --> 4511.58
might be celestial

4509.3 --> 4513.679
like the falling star effect

4511.58 --> 4516.5
which I'm not convinced is like a

4513.679 --> 4519.08
physical thing happening so but the left

4516.5 --> 4521.48
one absolutely was physical I mean the

4519.08 --> 4524.32
smoke trails are literally there that's

4521.48 --> 4524.32
not a hologram

4533.54 --> 4540.219
yeah

4535.96 --> 4540.219
very interesting thanks for sharing

4541.39 --> 4549.149
[Music]

4549.62 --> 4555.159
electric can easily make smoke yeah well

4552.14 --> 4555.159000000001
then still be physical

4555.8 --> 4563.3
yeah just like lightning is physical

4559.94 --> 4566.199
electrical is not mutually exclusive

4563.3 --> 4566.1990000000005
with physical

4566.48 --> 4572.36
now

4567.699 --> 4574.82
holographic that one is kind of mutually

4572.36 --> 4577.96
exclusive

4574.82 --> 4577.96
but physical

4578.9 --> 4583.219
not a reflection I'm not talking about

4581.9 --> 4585.08
reflection when you're talking about

4583.219 --> 4588.08
celestials we're not talking about

4585.08 --> 4588.08
reflections

4588.18 --> 4591.399
[Music]

4592.28 --> 4599.5599999999995
it's a reflection to the right okay let

4594.98 --> 4599.5599999999995
me look again I didn't see that

4614.26 --> 4619.3
no what reflection what are you talking

4617.06 --> 4619.3
about

4623.42 --> 4628.82
you know what's fascinating

4626.0 --> 4632.12
the on the right when it shoots up

4628.82 --> 4635.599999999999
it literally is like a a beam off like

4632.12 --> 4638.62
this bluish color that just

4635.6 --> 4638.620000000001
phases out

4639.199 --> 4644.54
it almost looks like

4642.08 --> 4650.92
a gas lamp

4644.54 --> 4650.92
right powering down that that's odd

4651.02 --> 4654.580000000001
very odd footage

4657.98 --> 4661.9
I don't see any Reflections though

4664.46 --> 4667.94
I mean

4665.719 --> 4672.52
technically

4667.94 --> 4672.5199999999995
they don't they're not simultaneous

4673.94 --> 4682.54
I mean that the one is definitely not a

4678.14 --> 4682.54
reflection of the other definitely not

4687.58 --> 4690.75
[Music]

4693.37 --> 4696.5689999999995
[Music]

4699.04 --> 4705.14
on their side down what

4702.78 --> 4708.34
[Music]

4705.14 --> 4708.34
talking about

4719.36 --> 4722.36
no

4734.84 --> 4738.82
from the lens no

4752.36 --> 4757.599999999999
hmm

4754.88 --> 4757.6
well

4757.76 --> 4765.159000000001
it's there is like a simultaneity though

4761.78 --> 4765.159
with like the brightness

4765.8 --> 4771.14
of it

4767.54 --> 4772.76
Ah that's bizarre so are you suggesting

4771.14 --> 4776.179
it's like a

4772.76 --> 4778.42
sort of a lens flare Reflection from the

4776.179 --> 4778.42
camera

4779.84 --> 4785.12
that's funny by the way because then

4781.94 --> 4788.08
literally then it is literally provably

4785.12 --> 4788.08
holographic

4788.3 --> 4792.9800000000005
by the way for the record I was right

4790.64 --> 4794.96
without even understanding why

4792.98 --> 4797.959999999999
so yeah

4794.96 --> 4799.82
because indeed like the the light when

4797.96 --> 4803.54
it gets really bright on the left side

4799.82 --> 4806.299999999999
then it's simultaneously lits up and

4803.54 --> 4808.6
that pattern is simultaneous I now saw

4806.3 --> 4808.6
that

4809.179 --> 4812.55
but it's pretty bizarre that it would

4811.4 --> 4815.789
look like that

4812.55 --> 4815.789
[Music]

4815.96 --> 4819.7390000000005
but fascinating because that would

4818.12 --> 4822.8
literally mean yeah that's that's

4819.739 --> 4823.759999999999
holographic it's like a reflection I

4822.8 --> 4826.6990000000005
guess

4823.76 --> 4828.679
the entire thing I thought a man like me

4826.699 --> 4831.0199999999995
was pointing at like oh there is a

4828.679 --> 4833.9
reflection of like both things somewhere

4831.02 --> 4837.8
but I didn't understand it right correct

4833.9 --> 4840.32
but yeah it now that you're saying

4837.8 --> 4842.4800000000005
it might be a reflection from like the

4840.32 --> 4845.179
lens or something now I just spotted

4842.48 --> 4848.9
like hey the the super bright lighting

4845.179 --> 4851.3
up goes perfectly simultaneous with The

4848.9 --> 4853.339999999999
Apparition on the right

4851.3 --> 4855.14
the lighting up and dying down is

4853.34 --> 4858.679
perfectly simultaneous like

4855.14 --> 4861.4400000000005
instantaneous that is very suspect and

4858.679 --> 4865.159
that would almost be a guarantee that

4861.44 --> 4868.58
the right thing is holographic in nature

4865.159 --> 4870.32
not necessarily Celestial cause right

4868.58 --> 4871.34
not saying like oh it's a Celestial

4870.32 --> 4875.16
thing

4871.34 --> 4876.7390000000005
but it's a purely light based thing

4875.16 --> 4880.04
[Music]

4876.739 --> 4883.4
that's what it seems to be

4880.04 --> 4886.12
and it might be caused by the camera

4883.4 --> 4886.12
I don't know

4908.54 --> 4911.54
foreign

4922.36 --> 4926.78
I don't think operation Fishbowl is

4925.159 --> 4928.159
actually a real thing because I don't

4926.78 --> 4931.84
think that

4928.159 --> 4931.839999999999
nukes work like that

4943.88 --> 4949.52
another X-File closed

4946.9 --> 4952.879999999999
perhaps really interesting footage

4949.52 --> 4956.6
though I mean to have to yeah any

4952.88 --> 4959.06
footage in which you have like a meteor

4956.6 --> 4961.400000000001
leaving a smoke Bloom is extremely

4959.06 --> 4963.9800000000005
fascinating to me it really because it

4961.4 --> 4967.28
emphasizes yeah that is a physical thing

4963.98 --> 4970.94
and that then well opens up that mystery

4967.28 --> 4974.92
like how what the hell how is that even

4970.94 --> 4974.919999999999
possible where is it coming from

4975.98 --> 4978.5199999999995
right

4984.38 --> 4992.2390000000005
it slows down as it begins to burn

4988.94 --> 4995.0599999999995
no I don't think so

4992.239 --> 4997.4
I think that your eyes don't really know

4995.06 --> 5000.4800000000005
how to size up whatever's happening with

4997.4 --> 5000.48
perspective right there

5002.8 --> 5006.54
it doesn't actually slow down

5015.4 --> 5020.32
yes yes Robert I remember you you

5018.28 --> 5025.78
telling me about that

5020.32 --> 5025.78
indeed hey you change your picture okay

5033.64 --> 5039.280000000001
oh man it's so cold in here

5037.48 --> 5043.08
it's even with the freaking heat lamp

5039.28 --> 5043.08
right next to me in reason

5054.94 --> 5059.739
right guys I hope you're liking the show

5057.4 --> 5061.12
by the way

5059.739 --> 5063.82
what's three

5061.12 --> 5066.34
quarters in

5063.82 --> 5068.94
if you like what I do please donate to

5066.34 --> 5068.9400000000005
my PayPal

5071.08 --> 5074.04
sure use it

5080.679 --> 5088.0
could I it be dropped first

5084.0 --> 5088.0
no uh

5088.55 --> 5092.56
[Music]

5089.94 --> 5096.46
I mean I guess you could technically

5092.56 --> 5102.34
like have a very specific high altitude

5096.46 --> 5105.54
balloon with a big rock on them and then

5102.34 --> 5105.54
use that

5106.48 --> 5109.199
somehow

5110.92 --> 5115.3
I guess it would be technically possible

5112.84 --> 5117.400000000001
to yeah but look if you're just gonna

5115.3 --> 5119.679
like float a rock

5117.4 --> 5122.0199999999995
a really big rock somewhere and then

5119.679 --> 5123.4
drop it it's not gonna be looking like

5122.02 --> 5127.0
that

5123.4 --> 5129.659
because this thing went down with an

5127.0 --> 5129.659
enormous speed

5130.0 --> 5136.06
like it really is it looks like it's be

5132.88 --> 5138.0
it's like a magnetically repulsed object

5136.06 --> 5141.219
that's what it looks like like it's been

5138.0 --> 5144.34
balled up that's why I say like there's

5141.219 --> 5147.52
probably electricity involved and where

5144.34 --> 5149.26
these well these pieces of sediment that

5147.52 --> 5151.42
come dropping off

5149.26 --> 5154.900000000001
they're probably electrified somehow

5151.42 --> 5159.28
because how the hell else would it build

5154.9 --> 5160.719
up that sudden extreme speed and burn up

5159.28 --> 5163.659
right

5160.719 --> 5166.54
I mean just burning up how do you burn

5163.659 --> 5168.46
up metal without just direct heat

5166.54 --> 5170.199
because there's probably not a lot of

5168.46 --> 5172.4800000000005
heat there well there's one way

5170.199 --> 5175.599999999999
electricity

5172.48 --> 5178.419999999999
so who knows man maybe like buffer

5175.6 --> 5180.9400000000005
moment as people imagine it is actually

5178.42 --> 5183.719
like a really heavily electrified

5180.94 --> 5183.719
barrier

5183.94 --> 5188.099999999999
maybe it is like super electrified

5188.38 --> 5194.9400000000005
somehow

5190.96 --> 5194.94
could it be a device now

5199.239 --> 5205.12
but I don't know

5201.28 --> 5208.3
I theoretically I you could imagine that

5205.12 --> 5210.58
maybe some Wizard or whatever figured

5208.3 --> 5212.139
out what meteors are and kind of knows

5210.58 --> 5213.94
how to actively trigger them or

5212.139 --> 5217.56
something

5213.94 --> 5217.5599999999995
that might be a possibility

5226.179 --> 5233.38
I mean there's even like suggestions

5230.639 --> 5235.78
that through magic spells or whatever

5233.38 --> 5238.719
you can literally open portals and have

5235.78 --> 5240.94
meteors sent them and I'm not talking

5238.719 --> 5243.88
about like Dungeons and Dragons or games

5240.94 --> 5246.48
I'm talking about like pretty old

5243.88 --> 5246.4800000000005
stuff

5249.28 --> 5252.54
so yeah maybe

5252.88 --> 5259.06
there is a control over it but it seems

5256.12 --> 5261.46
like meteors is like an inherent built

5259.06 --> 5263.9800000000005
mechanism it's not something that man

5261.46 --> 5265.36
added on Purely I mean the ideas about

5263.98 --> 5269.08
it sure

5265.36 --> 5272.679
but the actual meteor phenomena

5269.08 --> 5275.32
that seems natural seems to be part of

5272.679 --> 5278.159
this cycle

5275.32 --> 5278.159
of the realm

5283.36 --> 5289.839999999999
oh wow okay that's quite a resume Robert

5286.84 --> 5289.84
huh

5299.699 --> 5305.08
it's a meteor orbiting

5303.219 --> 5308.02
give us

5305.08 --> 5309.699
I mean so meteor would be orbiting what

5308.02 --> 5312.1
the [ __ ] supposed to be happening to

5309.699 --> 5315.339999999999
all the satellites then

5312.1 --> 5317.58
I mean they never actually draw any

5315.34 --> 5321.179
freaking consequences of of the

5317.58 --> 5321.179
presuppositions they have

5321.52 --> 5327.400000000001
I mean seriously like there is periodic

5324.42 --> 5329.679
meteoric showers as they call it right

5327.4 --> 5331.839999999999
there is I think especially during

5329.679 --> 5334.36
summer in certain regions I still

5331.84 --> 5336.82
remember that in Spain when we went on

5334.36 --> 5338.679
holiday in the summer a lot of there was

5336.82 --> 5341.259999999999
like in August this special time where

5338.679 --> 5344.86
like like hundreds of little meteors

5341.26 --> 5347.88
would be shooting right

5344.86 --> 5347.88
there's that

5348.76 --> 5352.860000000001
but like why

5361.42 --> 5364.7390000000005
I just don't know

5366.04 --> 5371.739
yeah but

5368.38 --> 5373.54
like have you even like drawn logical

5371.739 --> 5376.959999999999
conclusions like oh there's meteor

5373.54 --> 5380.199
showers like and I mean hundreds

5376.96 --> 5383.5
a lot in a certain period of time in the

5380.199 --> 5388.659
year yeah well what are The Satellites

5383.5 --> 5391.0
doing up there while that happens I mean

5388.659 --> 5392.92
how many of those are there there's like

5391.0 --> 5395.679
tens of thousands of satellites

5392.92 --> 5399.36
supposedly up there none of them are all

5395.679 --> 5402.58
not they're not all geostationary

5399.36 --> 5405.339999999999
so what happens with the freaking meteor

5402.58 --> 5408.94
showers that happen every year

5405.34 --> 5411.88
okay what happens to the satellites

5408.94 --> 5414.28
oh wait yeah it's because they're not

5411.88 --> 5417.1
actually there they're a fictional

5414.28 --> 5419.98
construct the cover for

5417.1 --> 5422.38
radio towers that can simply reach

5419.98 --> 5424.37
throughout most of the realm because

5422.38 --> 5427.58
it's flat

5424.37 --> 5427.58
[Music]

5440.92 --> 5445.38
causes it to explode at that height

5445.719 --> 5448.56
burning up

5450.159 --> 5452.638999999999
right

5456.1 --> 5464.26
so it is probably electrified metal

5461.86 --> 5466.36
that is lit maybe it's even the

5464.26 --> 5469.360000000001
electrification that like

5466.36 --> 5472.719
literally makes it to a point where it's

5469.36 --> 5473.62
liquid that it like a droplet just drops

5472.719 --> 5476.219
off

5473.62 --> 5479.38
right maybe it's so freaking electrified

5476.219 --> 5482.52
and it's like almost like the sediment

5479.38 --> 5486.04
which would be also metal is just like

5482.52 --> 5488.8
partially liquid even and that at some

5486.04 --> 5492.28
point it might drop off and then like it

5488.8 --> 5495.34
gets this giant burst

5492.28 --> 5497.199
and wow it is burning up like it's

5495.34 --> 5499.4800000000005
because it's burning right there's just

5497.199 --> 5502.0599999999995
nothing there to burn because it's like

5499.48 --> 5504.82
almost zero pressure

5502.06 --> 5508.0
right there's no Oxygen well then as

5504.82 --> 5511.719
soon as it basically bolts off then hits

5508.0 --> 5513.94
the oxygen rich part of the air then the

5511.719 --> 5518.02
actual ignition happens

5513.94 --> 5522.46
right so it would be like a molten blob

5518.02 --> 5526.3
of metal that's super hot electrified It

5522.46 --> 5528.28
Bolts off like a magnetic repulsion and

5526.3 --> 5529.54
then as soon as it starts hitting that

5528.28 --> 5532.62
air

5529.54 --> 5536.08
part of the air that has oxygen then

5532.62 --> 5539.739
then suddenly it lights up

5536.08 --> 5541.48
yeah I mean doesn't that model as I just

5539.739 --> 5543.28
presented doesn't that actually make

5541.48 --> 5545.739
perfect sense

5543.28 --> 5547.3
if you compare it too well

5545.739 --> 5550.0599999999995
footage

5547.3 --> 5553.719
like what Adam shared

5550.06 --> 5554.8
what what do you see

5553.719 --> 5557.199
right

5554.8 --> 5559.900000000001
doesn't it make perfect sense

5557.199 --> 5561.339999999999
so it's a piece of like sediment highly

5559.9 --> 5563.799999999999
electrified

5561.34 --> 5567.219
it might be even partially liquefied

5563.8 --> 5570.58
because of it but there's no Oxygen up

5567.219 --> 5573.58
there so it can't burn it it's just

5570.58 --> 5576.4
hot sort of liquidy and then at some

5573.58 --> 5579.34
point it's like bloop it falls off and

5576.4 --> 5582.58
then you get immediate magnetic burst

5579.34 --> 5583.96
like it shoots off like crazy but

5582.58 --> 5586.12
doesn't really have anything doesn't

5583.96 --> 5588.219
really happen it still just has all that

5586.12 --> 5590.98
heat all that energy but it's not

5588.219 --> 5592.96
burning and then suddenly it hits the

5590.98 --> 5595.239
thicker Aero layers with oxygen in it

5592.96 --> 5598.179
and then bang starts to ignite and might

5595.239 --> 5600.879999999999
even explode right because I mean

5598.179 --> 5604.62
it's liquid it's probably partially

5600.88 --> 5604.62
liquid as it drops off

5613.06 --> 5618.580000000001
right so yeah that's

5616.659 --> 5620.138999999999
that's my new model for what I think

5618.58 --> 5622.6
meteors are and it's funny enough

5620.139 --> 5624.659000000001
because it kind of still plays into that

5622.6 --> 5628.42
idea of

5624.659 --> 5630.94
that somehow there is a process up there

5628.42 --> 5635.02
that transmutates

5630.94 --> 5637.78
helium and hydrogen into well what would

5635.02 --> 5640.540000000001
be meteors and yeah maybe that happens

5637.78 --> 5642.88
like on the firmament itself and maybe

5640.54 --> 5646.179
it's electrified in order to do that

5642.88 --> 5648.34
because transmutation every time you

5646.179 --> 5651.28
hear anything about transmutation it's

5648.34 --> 5654.04
either really weird within chemistry or

5651.28 --> 5656.0199999999995
there is super heavy electricity

5654.04 --> 5658.54
involved

5656.02 --> 5659.9800000000005
right

5658.54 --> 5663.6
so yeah

5659.98 --> 5667.718999999999
maybe the firmament is super electrified

5663.6 --> 5670.5
and it actually transmutes hydrogen and

5667.719 --> 5673.9
helium into sediment

5670.5 --> 5675.76
and that that sediment is what we know

5673.9 --> 5677.86
as meteorites that are highly

5675.76 --> 5680.139
electrified and as soon as some part of

5677.86 --> 5682.48
it just drops off it bolts off through

5680.139 --> 5685.54
magnetism and then as soon as it hits

5682.48 --> 5687.58
the oxygen in the air it starts to burn

5685.54 --> 5690.36
and that is what we would see as

5687.58 --> 5690.36
meteorites

5690.58 --> 5696.12
so yeah that's my model

5693.4 --> 5696.12
for that

5697.9 --> 5703.138999999999
I'm kind of surprised how well developed

5700.42 --> 5706.8
it has become really

5703.139 --> 5706.8
kind of proud of it

5720.719 --> 5726.82
I mean it's not like some other Flat

5723.58 --> 5728.38
Earth or Speculator has rolled out this

5726.82 --> 5732.36
amazing

5728.38 --> 5735.219
super elaborate detail and realistic

5732.36 --> 5737.62
conception about what meteorites really

5735.219 --> 5741.76
are right

5737.62 --> 5743.679
I don't know any I'm yeah I'm the guy I

5741.76 --> 5746.280000000001
made a show about it even in flatter

5743.679 --> 5746.28
talks

5748.42 --> 5752.34
right

5750.28 --> 5752.34
yeah

5754.42 --> 5761.34
and that's like four or five years ago

5759.1 --> 5761.34
foreign

5763.48 --> 5767.58
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the

5765.34 --> 5767.58
show

5771.04 --> 5775.239
interesting discoveries

5772.96 --> 5777.28
I've been reading up on

5775.239 --> 5780.58
the book

5777.28 --> 5783.46
from Rudolph Steiner which is incredibly

5780.58 --> 5785.86
interesting the guy was an incredible

5783.46 --> 5788.56
genius

5785.86 --> 5791.639
even though like if you take it in

5788.56 --> 5794.38
modern time

5791.639 --> 5797.28
approach you'd probably think like that

5794.38 --> 5801.659000000001
guy is kind of a bit of an artist

5797.28 --> 5801.659
but he's really sharp

5803.86 --> 5808.5599999999995
so yeah I'm kind of impressed by the

5805.9 --> 5808.5599999999995
book so far

5808.9 --> 5814.239
and it's just fascinating to see

5811.12 --> 5816.76
somebody that like 120 years ago was

5814.239 --> 5819.28
basically trying to do the same process

5816.76 --> 5821.5
as what I'm doing building a framework

5819.28 --> 5823.42
of understanding for Spirit Mechanics

5821.5 --> 5825.76
for the subtle things

5823.42 --> 5830.62
like how the mind works how your

5825.76 --> 5833.46
internal Mechanics Work he he built that

5830.62 --> 5838.179
he built something like that

5833.46 --> 5840.94
120 years ago when absolutely nobody

5838.179 --> 5843.1
would ever yeah I mean it's pretty

5840.94 --> 5845.919999999999
miraculous that he that he was managing

5843.1 --> 5848.400000000001
to do that in that time

5845.92 --> 5848.4
right

5848.56 --> 5854.320000000001
I mean now with the Internet it's you

5852.28 --> 5856.239
can basically figure things out much

5854.32 --> 5859.659
more quickly

5856.239 --> 5862.9
he didn't have internet yeah

5859.659 --> 5865.379999999999
I mean at best he had libraries and the

5862.9 --> 5865.379999999999
post office

5866.44 --> 5870.0
maybe uh

5870.219 --> 5875.5
what do you call it again

5872.38 --> 5877.6
the pre-telephone maybe Telegraph he

5875.5 --> 5881.199
probably had Telegraph available to him

5877.6 --> 5883.179
right the rest it's all just library

5881.199 --> 5886.178999999999
books

5883.179 --> 5888.9400000000005
talking to people

5886.179 --> 5891.58
and letters

5888.94 --> 5892.719
pretty amazing what he achieved with all

5891.58 --> 5896.139
that

5892.719 --> 5898.4800000000005
and how we internalize with such detail

5896.139 --> 5901.42
but it's also funny that because it does

5898.48 --> 5903.58
reveal a lot like what

5901.42 --> 5907.54
what he was facing that he was facing

5903.58 --> 5910.659
like really nasty old block Skeptics

5907.54 --> 5913.12
that were only interested in power and

5910.659 --> 5916.5599999999995
peer pressure

5913.12 --> 5916.5599999999995
even back then

5926.199 --> 5931.599999999999
ah yeah Robert yeah it is a very

5929.62 --> 5935.679
fascinating series

5931.6 --> 5938.92
it's not completely gay free but

5935.679 --> 5941.4400000000005
it's it was very interesting and it's

5938.92 --> 5943.9
like it did not end the way that I

5941.44 --> 5946.419999999999
expected it and that's that's already an

5943.9 --> 5948.339999999999
accomplishment by itself it's a pretty

5946.42 --> 5951.179
good twist

5948.34 --> 5951.179
but uh

5951.4 --> 5958.44
right and I think even with saying that

5953.679 --> 5958.4400000000005
you'll just not totally see it coming

5958.719 --> 5962.44
because it wasn't the twist that I

5960.639 --> 5965.38
expected it would have because it does

5962.44 --> 5967.239
definitely reveal like it's a mystery

5965.38 --> 5969.46
thing there's probably going to be a

5967.239 --> 5971.08
Twist no matter what well I thought like

5969.46 --> 5976.12
oh it's going to be like this right and

5971.08 --> 5977.5599999999995
then it's like no okay all right no

5976.12 --> 5982.5599999999995
huh

5977.56 --> 5982.56
it's interesting how many episodes uh

5983.08 --> 5990.0
eight I think they're an hour each

5986.699 --> 5990.0
so yeah

5990.159 --> 5995.92
and

5992.679 --> 5998.38
it is Mystery so I'd recommend not to

5995.92 --> 6000.96
rush through it too much because there

5998.38 --> 6003.2390000000005
is really like a total transformation

6000.96 --> 6004.86
it's there's like a surreal

6003.239 --> 6007.62
transformation that's happening

6004.86 --> 6010.38
throughout the the entire thing

6007.62 --> 6013.0199999999995
and you need to give it some time to let

6010.38 --> 6015.179
the the parts of it sink in so don't

6013.02 --> 6016.860000000001
just like watch it all in a row right

6015.179 --> 6019.86
that that's gonna be a waste you're not

6016.86 --> 6022.92
gonna appreciate the quality that they

6019.86 --> 6023.65
put into it if you do that

6022.92 --> 6030.34

6069.659 --> 6075.719
the funny thing is that in a way it even

6072.179 --> 6078.179
like applies to the theme

6075.719 --> 6082.46
of my title

6078.179 --> 6082.46
it does I mean yeah

6083.3 --> 6089.52
Wikipedia okay whatever

6086.88 --> 6091.9800000000005
I don't really care what Wikipedia says

6089.52 --> 6094.4400000000005
these things are I'm just going by my

6091.98 --> 6096.239
own analysis and what I know about

6094.44 --> 6099.839999999999
reality

6096.239 --> 6101.169999999999

6158.28 --> 6161.78
yeah I'm not interested

6167.6 --> 6172.8
that's very cute

6170.219 --> 6176.78
but I'm absolutely boycotting anything

6172.8 --> 6176.78
that is Amazon or Bezos related

6177.78 --> 6182.159
yeah start watching it when they

6180.179 --> 6186.02
literally hand it over to something else

6182.159 --> 6186.0199999999995
that's when I'll start watching it

6191.159 --> 6193.28

6205.02 --> 6210.360000000001

6223.32 --> 6227.759999999999

6225.659 --> 6229.5599999999995
by the way I just have kind of cold

6227.76 --> 6231.780000000001

6231.78 --> 6237.48
not grappling I'm not secretly scheming

6235.32 --> 6240.36
against you

6237.48 --> 6242.959999999999
just have cold hands because it's kind

6240.36 --> 6242.96
of cold here

6248.52 --> 6252.4400000000005
no but it's really cool here

ah

6260.04 --> 6264.139
just warm up already damn it

6265.32 --> 6269.88
I think I just need to like eat some red

6267.659 --> 6271.98
pepper or something just to get my blood

6269.88 --> 6274.159000000001

6274.639 --> 6278.4800000000005
I got some so

6292.38 --> 6298.159000000001
oh okay Robert okay that's one way of

6295.38 --> 6298.159000000001
doing it I guess

6306.659 --> 6309.659

6373.26 --> 6378.2390000000005
trying to find just a complete package

6529.739 --> 6532.94
getting kind of hungry

[Music]

6766.34 --> 6772.679
I used to bike bicycle

6769.8 --> 6777.02
think it's like how much would that

6772.679 --> 6777.02
distance be like 20 miles Maybe

6777.2 --> 6786.42
[Music]

6785.46 --> 6789.55

uh no it's like 15 kilometers roughly

6809.699 --> 6814.619
right

6812.219 --> 6817.159
but yeah that's quite a distance if the

6814.619 --> 6817.159
weather sucks

[Music]

6842.4 --> 6845.36

Godzilla

6857.04 --> 6860.3
that is crazy

6868.26 --> 6872.280000000001
you grew up on a farm

6870.96 --> 6874.159
yeah

6872.28 --> 6877.619
well

6874.159 --> 6880.83
that's your manner show for it

6877.619 --> 6883.739
nah just kidding we love your manners

6880.83 --> 6886.44
[Music]

6883.739 --> 6889.009999999999
but you do have like that sort of free

6886.44 --> 6893.839
spirit thing so yeah

6889.01 --> 6893.839
[Music]

6898.739 --> 6904.199
I mean I grew up with a garden like

6901.8 --> 6907.92
garden with like a lot of different

6904.199 --> 6910.739
types of fruits and berries and [ __ ]

6907.92 --> 6913.7390000000005
that's what I grew up with not really a

6910.739 --> 6916.04
farm but still with like Garden care and

6913.739 --> 6916.04
all that

6929.28 --> 6934.739
did I ever visit Farms as a lab yeah I

6932.639 --> 6936.06
worked on it

6934.739 --> 6939.0599999999995
as a kid

6936.06 --> 6942.719
in my troubled times

6939.06 --> 6945.179
when I was like not whenever yeah but

6942.719 --> 6947.639
yeah I basically went to a farm I really

6945.179 --> 6948.9
liked it it was like a biodynamic farm

6947.639 --> 6950.82
too

6948.9 --> 6955.5599999999995
like they had their own Made bread and

6950.82 --> 6958.98
was amazing so so good all the food they

6955.56 --> 6960.6
had I really enjoyed that and yeah but

6958.98 --> 6963.959999999999
there were like completely different

6960.6 --> 6967.1
type of people I was all about like ah

6963.96 --> 6970.619
talking and talking and talking and like

6967.1 --> 6972.84
fantasy and space and all kinds of

6970.619 --> 6973.94
things they were not very talkative

6972.84 --> 6977.400000000001
there

6973.94 --> 6979.5599999999995
So eventually I just like basically got

6977.4 --> 6980.4
the signal like yeah just shut the [ __ ]

6979.56 --> 6982.080000000001
up

6980.4 --> 6985.04
because they would just endlessly

6982.08 --> 6985.04
blabber all the time

6988.5 --> 6993.98
but yeah I did actually work on a farm a

6991.02 --> 6996.179
bit even milked some cows

6993.98 --> 6999.0599999999995
shoveled a lot of [ __ ]

6996.179 --> 7000.7390000000005
but I also did that well doing horseback

6999.06 --> 7004.179
riding

7000.739 --> 7004.178999999999
taking care of the Stables

7004.58 --> 7008.98
so I've been around a bit

7010.52 --> 7015.860000000001
but I did not literally grow up on a

7013.04 --> 7017.78
farm I wasn't like forced to live that

7015.86 --> 7019.219
way and like I would have been actually

7017.78 --> 7022.42
kind of nice too

7019.219 --> 7022.42
in retrospect

7031.28 --> 7035.679
not talk that maybe they were monks no

7033.38 --> 7038.36
they were just like very

7035.679 --> 7040.159
old-fashioned Christian and just not

7038.36 --> 7041.659
very talk they weren't like very

7040.159 --> 7044.659
vernacular

7041.659 --> 7046.759999999999
like real farmer like yeah

7044.659 --> 7048.619
it's like the old-fashioned Dutch farmer

7046.76 --> 7050.179
type

7048.619 --> 7052.46
they're probably not around a lot

7050.179 --> 7055.159
anymore because just the farmers have

7052.46 --> 7056.96
like had to like adapt and move on and

7055.159 --> 7059.36
they were different they're slightly

7056.96 --> 7061.58
different types now but like the old

7059.36 --> 7066.44
farmer that would just like yeah super

7061.58 --> 7069.099
suit first awake I mean like annoyingly

7066.44 --> 7069.098999999999
stoic

7070.42 --> 7074.7390000000005
but that's it that's the word yeah

7075.86 --> 7079.5199999999995
and like they didn't they didn't chat

7078.139 --> 7082.58
with each other

7079.52 --> 7086.080000000001
we just like sit around the table and

7082.58 --> 7088.88
just eat just no talking it was like

7086.08 --> 7091.159
Like a Prayer they had like prayer

7088.88 --> 7095.1990000000005
rituals they were Christian

7091.159 --> 7095.199
but like they just didn't talk

7095.48 --> 7099.919999999999
and for me yeah that eventually kind of

7098.3 --> 7101.56
killed it off because I was just a

7099.92 --> 7103.6990000000005
chatty [ __ ]

7101.56 --> 7105.4400000000005
always chatting always number one

7103.699 --> 7106.699
inquisitive I want to figure out why are

7105.44 --> 7109.339999999999
you like this why are you still why

7106.699 --> 7111.44
don't you talk so much right I do that

7109.34 --> 7113.719
[ __ ] well eventually I just felt like

7111.44 --> 7114.86
I'm not welcome here anymore and I could

7113.719 --> 7118.94
not

7114.86 --> 7121.88
do all that just shutting up I couldn't

7118.94 --> 7125.239
do it I would go literally insane

7121.88 --> 7127.58
because I just had to blabber my head

7125.239 --> 7130.178999999999
off trying to figure everything out I

7127.58 --> 7130.179
couldn't stop

7134.84 --> 7138.9400000000005
Gap win what

7142.46 --> 7146.84
right but I still have like very

7144.739 --> 7149.32
distinct memories about like going to

7146.84 --> 7149.32
that place

7150.8 --> 7159.320000000001
it was the first time I've ever like
