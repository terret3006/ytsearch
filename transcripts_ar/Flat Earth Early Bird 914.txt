76.88 --> 80.15899999999999
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

79.119 --> 82.159
weekend

80.159 --> 84.56
please also do support me through the

82.159 --> 86.88000000000001
paypal patreon crypto wallet super chat

84.56 --> 90.24000000000001
and the membership system join button

86.88 --> 90.24
that'll be much appreciated

93.04 --> 97.759
so whether today's

98.84 --> 105.84
hot it's a little clouded though

103.28 --> 108.32000000000001
but very thin clouds not really stopping

105.84 --> 108.32000000000001
the sun

108.399 --> 111.6
and yeah it's a bit of a breeze here and

111.119 --> 114.0
there

111.6 --> 117.67999999999999
but it is it goes up and down right now

114.0 --> 117.68
it's the wind is kind of still

118.399 --> 121.119
it's really

122.64 --> 126.479
yeah when the wind is still it's really

126.84 --> 131.599
warm

129.36 --> 133.12
this still a little moist in the air as

131.599 --> 137.67999999999998
well

133.12 --> 140.72
so yeah lots of birds out there

137.68 --> 143.84
hanging around with their mouths open

140.72 --> 146.16
typically a sign that that it's hot

143.84 --> 147.68
so i made sure to provide them with some

146.16 --> 151.28
fresh water

147.68 --> 153.44
on the roof a couple of magpies

151.28 --> 156.319
immediately dove into it

153.44 --> 156.319
to take a bath

156.64 --> 161.44
and there's a flock of white doves

158.64 --> 161.44
flying around

162.4 --> 166.239
that's pretty amazing site and they

164.56 --> 170.31900000000002
typically like to go for that

166.239 --> 173.519
bowl of water too yeah

170.319 --> 175.04
maybe they'll come by somewhere during

173.519 --> 178.8
the show

175.04 --> 178.79999999999998
anyway yeah beautiful weather

181.12 --> 184.159
almost shirtless but just thought no

183.599 --> 186.72
it's

184.159 --> 186.72
doable

187.68 --> 196.239
right so it's friday

192.4 --> 199.84
friday friday the 4th of

196.239 --> 199.84
june 2021

200.239 --> 212.08
hey hello amanda young first in chat

204.159 --> 215.92
good to see you how are you doing girl

212.08 --> 217.15
i got another bottle of grapefruit juice

215.92 --> 218.72
again

217.15 --> 222.159
[Music]

218.72 --> 226.0
because i really enjoyed that yesterday

222.159 --> 228.0
it did give me a big boost i yeah i

226.0 --> 229.04
don't know if it really contributed to

228.0 --> 232.72
something

229.04 --> 235.92
i also take vitamin c supplements

232.72 --> 239.519
but yeah this night i did not have

235.92 --> 243.439
pain and [ __ ] anymore

239.519 --> 246.239
and it seems what i thought originally

243.439 --> 249.2
was going to happen

246.239 --> 250.159
uh after last weekend it took a little

249.2 --> 252.23899999999998
longer

250.159 --> 254.39999999999998
as in the sore period took a little

252.239 --> 256.799
longer because i think that now finally

254.4 --> 259.759
it's kind of gone

256.799 --> 259.75899999999996
just a little raw

261.12 --> 266.16
still a little weird because yeah the

264.4 --> 266.96
arrangement of my teeth are slightly

266.16 --> 268.72
different

266.96 --> 270.71999999999997
but i know it's already kind of

268.72 --> 273.52000000000004
maneuvering back

270.72 --> 274.40000000000003
it just happens because yeah the way

273.52 --> 278.71999999999997
your

274.4 --> 278.71999999999997
teeth push against each other

279.84 --> 287.19899999999996
right but yeah no painful stuff i even

283.84 --> 287.19899999999996
like i can just put

288.88 --> 293.84
cold water on there and nothing happens

291.36 --> 293.84000000000003
now that

294.08 --> 301.19899999999996
that's been a long time because i've

297.84 --> 303.52
had issues with that part

301.199 --> 304.56
for a while but so yeah really happy

303.52 --> 307.59999999999997
about that

304.56 --> 310.639
let's hope it stays that way

307.6 --> 313.36
yeah i'm glad you're doing all right

310.639 --> 313.36
amanda young

313.84 --> 319.67999999999995
and so uh so am i

317.28 --> 321.35999999999996
did make it a little late though but not

319.68 --> 325.84000000000003
super late

321.36 --> 325.84000000000003
three o'clock yeah it's it's still late

326.8 --> 331.28000000000003
but it was enough to get a good night's

329.84 --> 333.84
rest

331.28 --> 336.55999999999995
so because like this night it was nice

333.84 --> 336.56
and breezy

336.72 --> 341.759
and cool so yeah most of the night i

339.52 --> 345.59999999999997
pretty much had my door

341.759 --> 349.52000000000004
pretty wide open so i could really like

345.6 --> 351.6
take in the fresh air that was nice

349.52 --> 352.88
that that helped a lot compared to the

351.6 --> 354.88
night before when that

352.88 --> 356.56
didn't really happen and was like sweaty

354.88 --> 358.8
a lot

356.56 --> 358.8
uh

360.479 --> 364.84
right so yeah no flatter debate

362.319 --> 367.72
yesterday

364.84 --> 370.31899999999996
again

367.72 --> 372.319
[Music]

370.319 --> 375.6
i don't know if there will be live

372.319 --> 378.24
letter debates today

375.6 --> 381.84000000000003
there should be nathan hasn't said there

378.24 --> 381.84000000000003
wouldn't be

382.639 --> 395.84000000000003
and i am kind of looking forward to

384.72 --> 395.84000000000003
getting back with the guys

396.88 --> 402.4
all right oh yeah by the way

400.16 --> 403.68
for the first time now since over a week

402.4 --> 406.23999999999995
my youtube is

403.68 --> 408.08
just stable again i can actually see

406.24 --> 410.0
myself on the youtube page without the

408.08 --> 412.88
stupid flickering

410.0 --> 415.039
so that's nice that's nice change back

412.88 --> 417.68
to normal

415.039 --> 419.52
i was almost i was kind of prepared to

417.68 --> 422.24
like okay that's gonna be like that

419.52 --> 422.88
from now on probably to nag with me but

422.24 --> 427.12
it's

422.88 --> 427.12
it's over ok

434.84 --> 451.84
ok let's see

453.68 --> 456.24
all right

461.44 --> 464.879
okay so yeah other than nathan oakley

464.0 --> 468.96
premieres

464.879 --> 473.759
and david weiss had another interview

468.96 --> 475.44
i think in australia

473.759 --> 478.72
i haven't seen that one but i just

475.44 --> 483.039
noticed that in the

478.72 --> 483.03900000000004
in the notification list from youtube

484.639 --> 488.0
has anybody watched that

489.36 --> 493.84000000000003
check yeah tom you

494.08 --> 507.84
right it's 23 minutes

497.759 --> 507.84000000000003
flat earth is ridiculous

512.0 --> 517.12
i might check that out later

515.599 --> 518.88
especially if there's not going to be a

517.12 --> 521.839
live letter of debates and i'll check it

518.88 --> 521.8389999999999
out

525.279 --> 535.8389999999999
oh man i can't really

529.92 --> 535.8389999999999
forgetting to make notes

546.44 --> 552.72
[Applause]

547.6 --> 552.72
hey seeking star water good to see you

554.08 --> 557.279
thunder and lightning storm

559.279 --> 564.399
exciting hello james

574.839 --> 577.839
two

594.399 --> 596.72
right

602.839 --> 605.839
okay

608.88 --> 623.519
yeah james too i know i'm doing fine

618.24 --> 623.519
a little flushed from the heat

630.48 --> 634.5600000000001
but yeah my jaw situation is is kind of

633.36 --> 637.12
rounding out

634.56 --> 640.399
and so like it's it's a real relief

637.12 --> 640.399
getting back to normal

653.839 --> 661.839
what have you all been up to

657.519 --> 661.839
out there

677.279 --> 689.8389999999999
is everybody having a nice summers

691.279 --> 703.8389999999999
so here we go again

707.17 --> 710.3199999999999
[Music]

714.839 --> 717.839
oh

724.72 --> 727.9200000000001
hey tony whitcomb

728.32 --> 731.839
welcome back to chat

733.2 --> 738.32
ewar channel 7

742.24 --> 745.839
don't know about that channel

751.04 --> 755.279
you can't warp your head around it

753.279 --> 758.32
around coriolis effect

755.279 --> 762.0
yeah james too well the problem is that

758.32 --> 762.0
the coriolis effect has been

764.639 --> 770.24
hijacked added on

767.839 --> 772.48
like a parasite adding on to what the

770.24 --> 776.16
coriolis effect is

772.48 --> 779.36
in relation to earth spin claims

776.16 --> 782.079
right that's the problem so

779.36 --> 782.88
when you google it and look in wikipedia

782.079 --> 786.16
or something

782.88 --> 786.56
yeah it's gonna tell you very short

786.16 --> 788.639
piece

786.56 --> 791.8389999999999
what the coriolis effect actually is an

788.639 --> 794.5600000000001
apparent deviation

791.839 --> 798.399
nothing actual it just seems like it's

794.56 --> 798.399
basically an interpretation

799.76 --> 804.639
phenomenal it's based on the

802.24 --> 808.48
interpretation of the person

804.639 --> 809.839
or the observer based on that the

808.48 --> 813.839
observer

809.839 --> 816.24
is rotating is moving

813.839 --> 817.519
relation to everything else and that

816.24 --> 819.36
they would interpret

817.519 --> 823.76
like everything else is actually

819.36 --> 823.76
rotating or moving in relation to them

825.44 --> 828.5600000000001
and how that interpretation would work

827.44 --> 832.1600000000001
mechanically

828.56 --> 835.68
right that's the coriolis effect

832.16 --> 840.399
what it isn't is a force

835.68 --> 844.0
is something that actually causes

840.399 --> 847.279
motion of things actual motion

844.0 --> 847.279
that's what it doesn't cause

848.8 --> 852.639
and that's really where the big mistake

850.639 --> 853.6
comes in and it's been put there on

852.639 --> 856.48
purpose

853.6 --> 857.519
because all the global coriolis effect

856.48 --> 860.0790000000001
claims

857.519 --> 861.76
are that it actually does cause actual

860.079 --> 863.3599999999999
motion of things

861.76 --> 866.88
like it's claimed that they're supposed

863.36 --> 866.88
to be the cause of hurricanes

867.76 --> 872.48
but then when you inquire as to how

873.12 --> 879.04
the problem is is that it's

876.24 --> 879.519
kind of suggested that hurricanes are

879.04 --> 882.56
like a

879.519 --> 886.32
turbulent side effect

882.56 --> 888.7199999999999
of the air standing still

886.32 --> 890.32
in relation to the spinning earth and

888.72 --> 893.6800000000001
then that the friction

890.32 --> 896.48
sort of of it is kind of causing

893.68 --> 898.16
the tornadoes and the hurricanes that's

896.48 --> 900.48
the idea

898.16 --> 901.279
the issue though is for that claim to

900.48 --> 904.88
even become

901.279 --> 906.8
remotely considerable

904.88 --> 908.399
the air would have to stand still in

906.8 --> 910.8
relation to the spinning earth and it

908.399 --> 914.079
doesn't

910.8 --> 916.079
it doesn't so well that

914.079 --> 917.279
very early on flat earthers versus

916.079 --> 919.12
baller

917.279 --> 920.72
got the ballers to basically concede

919.12 --> 923.519
like yeah there is no flight time

920.72 --> 923.519
deviations

925.519 --> 929.279
and then the baller started to come

927.36 --> 931.04
forward with yeah that's because the air

929.279 --> 931.68
moves in lockstep with the earth well

931.04 --> 935.36
guess what

931.68 --> 936.399
if you claim that then the coriolis

935.36 --> 938.72
effect

936.399 --> 940.32
or rather the turbulent side effect of

938.72 --> 942.32
the air moving

940.32 --> 944.9590000000001
or the earth moving underneath the air

942.32 --> 949.36
and then having some friction elements

944.959 --> 951.1199999999999
it cannot cause hurricanes

949.36 --> 953.04
if you say that the air moves in

951.12 --> 955.6
lockstep because then there is no

953.04 --> 957.759
turbulence in order to cause some actual

955.6 --> 960.0
deviations

957.759 --> 960.0
right

960.88 --> 965.8389999999999
it's very confusing that way so the only

963.519 --> 967.68
way you can hang on to that somehow the

965.839 --> 968.9590000000001
coriolis that's not even a coriolis

967.68 --> 971.5999999999999
effect but that the

968.959 --> 973.5189999999999
earth spinning underneath the air would

971.6 --> 976.72
cause the hurricanes

973.519 --> 978.72
and the tornadoes on earth then you

976.72 --> 980.24
would have to anchor yourself within

978.72 --> 981.839
that argument

980.24 --> 984.16
that the earth is spinning underneath

981.839 --> 988.0
the air and so there will be

984.16 --> 991.36
flight time deviations drones deviating

988.0 --> 994.72
right that's how randy lost his drone

991.36 --> 997.6800000000001
took it up too high lost signal and then

994.72 --> 999.12
it floated off to ireland

997.68 --> 1000.8
because the earth was spinning

999.12 --> 1006.079
underneath

1000.8 --> 1011.8389999999999
right so i hope that clarifies

1006.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
about the coriolis effect james 2.

1022.839 --> 1026.079
ah

1024.4 --> 1028.4
right but what the coriolis effect

1026.079 --> 1032.24
actually is is only apparent

1028.4 --> 1032.24
it's not actual deviations

1032.319 --> 1035.76
it's the observer that's deviating and

1034.88 --> 1038.0
the object

1035.76 --> 1038.8799999999999
eject that's just moving or standing

1038.0 --> 1042.24
still

1038.88 --> 1042.959
in relation to the the main reference

1042.24 --> 1046.48
frame

1042.959 --> 1048.48
the is it non-inertial

1046.48 --> 1049.76
i kind of mix them up the names for the

1048.48 --> 1051.919
frames but

1049.76 --> 1053.76
the frame that's standing still right

1051.919 --> 1055.3600000000001
and the observer is in the frame that's

1053.76 --> 1058.48
moving

1055.36 --> 1062.1599999999999
so it's all about reference frames

1058.48 --> 1066.72
something moving the observer and

1062.16 --> 1069.679
the world's reference frame not moving

1066.72 --> 1071.76
that's how we test it here on earth but

1069.679 --> 1074.72
yeah with the globe spinning

1071.76 --> 1075.2
model it's assumed that the earth is

1074.72 --> 1077.3600000000001
moving

1075.2 --> 1079.28
and that the rest around the world is

1077.36 --> 1082.1599999999999
standing still

1079.28 --> 1082.8799999999999
but then the air would also be standing

1082.16 --> 1084.3200000000002
still

1082.88 --> 1086.0
while the earth moved underneath it

1084.32 --> 1088.0
which would means that in relation to

1086.0 --> 1091.36
the earth there would be a constant wind

1088.0 --> 1092.96
in one direction at all time

1091.36 --> 1095.12
because the earth is spinning underneath

1092.96 --> 1095.919
it so to those who are standing on the

1095.12 --> 1098.3999999999999
earth

1095.919 --> 1101.1200000000001
it would be experienced as if there is a

1098.4 --> 1103.919
wind in the constant direction

1101.12 --> 1105.039
one direction right it would be uniform

1103.919 --> 1106.96
and when you would be

1105.039 --> 1109.919
in that reference frame of the air

1106.96 --> 1112.0
standing still in relation to the earth

1109.919 --> 1113.919
it would not be all gushing one

1112.0 --> 1115.84
direction going in the other direction

1113.919 --> 1120.4
no it would be literally like

1115.84 --> 1122.1599999999999
hanging still there would be

1120.4 --> 1125.2
it would be standing still it would be

1122.16 --> 1128.48
like the pressure is equalized

1125.2 --> 1131.039
discounting the idea that yeah

1128.48 --> 1131.76
outer space vacuum right because that

1131.039 --> 1137.44
makes the whole

1131.76 --> 1140.16
setup impossible anyway

1137.44 --> 1143.039
all right let's let's just tackle one

1140.16 --> 1143.039
issue at a time

1144.08 --> 1153.6789999999999
ah yes james 2 you're welcome

1151.36 --> 1156.3999999999999
why would you think the air is standing

1153.679 --> 1156.4
still well

1156.48 --> 1160.559
that's a good question tony whitcomb why

1159.12 --> 1162.559
would he assume that the air standing

1160.559 --> 1164.0
still are not moving in lockstep with

1162.559 --> 1167.52
the presupposed rotating

1164.0 --> 1170.48
ball earth it's because air

1167.52 --> 1171.36
gases are not susceptible to momentum

1170.48 --> 1175.1200000000001
that's kind of

1171.36 --> 1176.84
my expression for it it's probably not

1175.12 --> 1179.039
technically 100

1176.84 --> 1179.6
correct but that's really what it's

1179.039 --> 1182.559
about

1179.6 --> 1184.7199999999998
it's it points at the difference because

1182.559 --> 1187.9189999999999
water

1184.72 --> 1191.1200000000001
uh liquids and solids are

1187.919 --> 1191.6000000000001
susceptible to no momentum that means

1191.12 --> 1195.12
that

1191.6 --> 1196.0
if you have a body of it and you throw

1195.12 --> 1199.9189999999999
it

1196.0 --> 1202.159
it retains the momentum of the throw

1199.919 --> 1203.8400000000001
and then keeps on going after release

1202.159 --> 1206.5590000000002
that's momentum right

1203.84 --> 1208.48
if you take a cup of water your throat

1206.559 --> 1211.52
it's gonna pour out

1208.48 --> 1213.76
in an arc because it has momentum

1211.52 --> 1214.8799999999999
it's not just gonna hang still where you

1213.76 --> 1218.24
stop

1214.88 --> 1220.4
the move or if you did that with gases

1218.24 --> 1222.4
that would happen because gases don't

1220.4 --> 1225.44
have momentum they just

1222.4 --> 1227.679
either hang still sort of in equilibrium

1225.44 --> 1230.4
slowly spreading out or they rapidly

1227.679 --> 1232.24
expand in all directions based on the

1230.4 --> 1234.72
pressure dynamics of what's around them

1232.24 --> 1238.0
and the density of the gases around it

1234.72 --> 1238.96
like the air but it doesn't have

1238.0 --> 1242.32
momentum

1238.96 --> 1243.919
it doesn't retain the throw motion and

1242.32 --> 1246.84
then moves on in an arc

1243.919 --> 1248.64
like a solid wood if you through the cup

1246.84 --> 1250.6399999999999
itself

1248.64 --> 1252.24
or if you had liquid in the cup then the

1250.64 --> 1254.72
water would retain

1252.24 --> 1256.0
the momentum gases don't do that right

1254.72 --> 1260.0
and because of that

1256.0 --> 1263.84
effect inherent to mat to gas

1260.0 --> 1263.84
it's not going to be able to

1266.08 --> 1271.84
get into a lockstep motion

1269.52 --> 1273.76
with matter unless it is specifically

1271.84 --> 1276.48
contained by it and even then

1273.76 --> 1276.8799999999999
there's going to be a gradient because

1276.48 --> 1280.88
if

1276.88 --> 1281.5200000000002
yeah if gas is moving in a container and

1280.88 --> 1285.8400000000001
there's like

1281.52 --> 1289.36
a cut off point there's a wall

1285.84 --> 1290.3999999999999
say you have like a a tire the inside of

1289.36 --> 1293.12
a tire

1290.4 --> 1295.2
and there's a piece that will cut off

1293.12 --> 1297.36
everything

1295.2 --> 1299.6000000000001
so that it can't just flow freely in a

1297.36 --> 1302.24
circle

1299.6 --> 1303.76
then if you keep rotating it the

1302.24 --> 1308.4
pressure dynamics will cause

1303.76 --> 1310.0
more pressure on the side of the wall

1308.4 --> 1311.52
that's pushing there will be more

1310.0 --> 1312.48
pressure and there will be less pressure

1311.52 --> 1314.32
on the other side

1312.48 --> 1316.24
as it's spinning like that because the

1314.32 --> 1320.48
air doesn't have momentum in

1316.24 --> 1322.88
the inner tire it's trying to keep still

1320.48 --> 1324.72
but the thing the ball is pushing

1322.88 --> 1326.24
against it so there would be a pressure

1324.72 --> 1328.96
differential because of it

1326.24 --> 1330.72
now if there was not this wall then the

1328.96 --> 1335.919
air will simply

1330.72 --> 1339.84
hang still as the tire is rotating

1335.919 --> 1340.4
except maybe for like right next to the

1339.84 --> 1343.039
tire

1340.4 --> 1345.039
walls because there might be some

1343.039 --> 1346.48
friction so some of the gas might be

1345.039 --> 1348.08
pulled there might be some micro

1346.48 --> 1350.48
turbulence there

1348.08 --> 1352.799
but overall the body of gas in the inner

1350.48 --> 1354.799
tire as it's rotating is standing still

1352.799 --> 1358.1589999999999
because it doesn't have

1354.799 --> 1362.08
any susceptibility to momentum

1358.159 --> 1366.3200000000002
well that element about gases

1362.08 --> 1366.32
applies to a model

1366.48 --> 1372.32
model ball earth with gases somehow

1369.28 --> 1375.6
being able to stick onto it

1372.32 --> 1377.6789999999999
and then it moving the earth moving

1375.6 --> 1378.8799999999999
the air is not going to move in lockstep

1377.679 --> 1382.72
rotation

1378.88 --> 1382.72
because there's nothing to really push

1386.84 --> 1389.84
it

1400.84 --> 1406.72
oh did i mix you two up

1404.32 --> 1406.72
sorry

1408.4 --> 1412.24
i guess it was tiny one more question

1413.12 --> 1417.84
hey neil cosentino hey agm

1418.32 --> 1422.48
is there fed today or there should be

1422.72 --> 1428.84
nathan hasn't messaged in any skype chat

1426.64 --> 1431.679
that he's not going to do a show today

1428.84 --> 1435.6
so

1431.679 --> 1435.6000000000001
we'll find out in an hour

1437.679 --> 1445.8400000000001
hello hmm

1448.64 --> 1453.279
yeah sorry for mixing you up with tiny

1451.12 --> 1459.84
wombo there tony whitcomb

1453.279 --> 1459.84
it's you're both tws

1466.24 --> 1470.4
how's the weather here sunny hot

1471.6 --> 1476.6399999999999
real summer's day amazing

1484.799 --> 1487.84
pouring rain here

1504.0 --> 1507.76
yes neil i agree

1508.159 --> 1512.159
i think predominantly in america and

1510.799 --> 1515.36
around the regions of

1512.159 --> 1517.0390000000002
syria and iran and maybe

1515.36 --> 1520.0
china is doing it too but i think that

1517.039 --> 1525.12
they're like laying off

1520.0 --> 1525.76
it it seems to mostly be deployed as

1525.12 --> 1530.08
like

1525.76 --> 1532.24
basically an add-on agitation tactic

1530.08 --> 1533.4399999999998
mess around with the weather make it too

1532.24 --> 1543.84
wet or too

1533.44 --> 1543.8400000000001
hot for convenience

1545.52 --> 1549.039
right on the other hand the united

1547.12 --> 1549.52
states has always had pretty heavy

1549.039 --> 1554.72
weather

1549.52 --> 1554.72
right it's naturally it is like that

1554.84 --> 1560.8799999999999
it's it seems like

1557.36 --> 1565.279
yeah cloud seeding and

1560.88 --> 1567.679
maybe some harp like activities as well

1565.279 --> 1571.84
that's good to push to basically push

1567.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
weather fronts around

1577.36 --> 1581.12
never seen it like this okay well why'd

1579.679 --> 1583.8400000000001
you ask rasta

1581.12 --> 1586.32
if he's still willing to come back to

1583.84 --> 1588.1589999999999
chat here because

1586.32 --> 1589.84
he's in california and he's been paying

1588.159 --> 1599.8400000000001
a lot of attention and it's been like

1589.84 --> 1599.84
that for years

1602.4 --> 1627.8400000000001
one day 90 the next 50 hmm

1612.96 --> 1627.8400000000001
yeah that's a big difference

1635.039 --> 1641.44
well neil every region

1638.159 --> 1644.0800000000002
in the united states has its own

1641.44 --> 1646.0800000000002
record of weather patterns like it's

1644.08 --> 1647.9189999999999
been recorded

1646.08 --> 1649.84
for a long time like what is the weather

1647.919 --> 1654.0
like throughout the seasons

1649.84 --> 1657.039
typically and what are the extremities

1654.0 --> 1659.52
so you could technically try to look

1657.039 --> 1659.52
that up

1659.6 --> 1664.32
ask meteorologists that are that seem

1663.039 --> 1667.36
reliable at least

1664.32 --> 1669.84
like hey is this normal weather is this

1667.36 --> 1669.84
typical

1671.2 --> 1675.279
and then they might lay out a history of

1673.44 --> 1675.679
the weather of that region like what

1675.279 --> 1678.24
it's

1675.679 --> 1679.3600000000001
normally like if they have the knowledge

1678.24 --> 1683.84
for that

1679.36 --> 1683.84
in that of that area

1691.279 --> 1695.52
yeah typical weather behavior has been

1693.52 --> 1697.84
studied and recorded for quite a long

1695.52 --> 1697.84
time

1722.84 --> 1727.9189999999999
tortuga

1724.64 --> 1727.919
dry tortugas

1731.12 --> 1733.76
where is that

1734.799 --> 1753.84
florida coast let me

1738.399 --> 1753.84
look at that

1756.72 --> 1759.1200000000001
all right

1763.679 --> 1769.3600000000001
well that's like a tiny tiny tiny little

1766.96 --> 1769.3600000000001
island

1770.64 --> 1774.64
in between florida and cuba

1777.52 --> 1782.24
wow like i zoomed out too far and i even

1780.24 --> 1795.84
just lost where it is

1782.24 --> 1795.84
it's that tiny

1799.44 --> 1806.0800000000002
hey nathan oakley

1802.88 --> 1823.7600000000002
what the hell are you blabbering about

1806.08 --> 1837.84
terror level what

1823.76 --> 1837.84
hey random explorer

1890.84 --> 1893.84
uh

1899.679 --> 1909.039
climate fear oh no

1903.12 --> 1909.039
scared of the weather scary scary

1918.84 --> 1921.84
weather

1946.84 --> 1949.84
so

1955.2 --> 1959.44
hello slow mo moon buggy yeah i was

1957.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
wondering that too like

1959.44 --> 1963.8400000000001
what is this is this some kind of a joke

1964.88 --> 1969.8400000000001
terror level for that

1973.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
like where in england or what

1977.039 --> 1991.84
what does it mean

1993.12 --> 2005.84
oh hello by the way fe diplomat good to

1995.76 --> 2005.84
see you

2017.279 --> 2024.96
oh yeah i keep forgetting

2021.679 --> 2026.799
like it's kind of like the with this

2024.96 --> 2028.799
weather i should really be getting like

2026.799 --> 2030.399
the foot bath out again

2028.799 --> 2033.12
because that worked really well last

2030.399 --> 2035.6789999999999
year when it was hot

2033.12 --> 2037.1999999999998
but i keep forgetting i should really

2035.679 --> 2047.8400000000001
get one

2037.2 --> 2047.8400000000001
get it back in here

2065.839 --> 2072.24
seems like nathan is just thought he

2068.159 --> 2072.2400000000002
wanted to drop that in chat and then

2072.839 --> 2075.839
leave

2098.88 --> 2117.839
okay tiny wumble how do you know that

2118.16 --> 2131.839
mi5 website what they have a website

2135.52 --> 2140.079
threat is listed as substantial

2141.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
hello adam makin by the way good to see

2143.359 --> 2145.839
you

2158.56 --> 2162.32
the threat from terrorism

2164.64 --> 2187.839
from who exactly do they elaborate

2172.8 --> 2187.8390000000004
the terrorists in question

2207.119 --> 2213.359
oh so there's like this level of threat

2210.56 --> 2214.0789999999997
but they don't actually say what who the

2213.359 --> 2216.3199999999997
threat

2214.079 --> 2216.32
is

2222.0 --> 2229.839
counter espionage

2254.839 --> 2257.839
okay

2275.04 --> 2278.88
yeah bad feet we know

2279.04 --> 2285.839
it's hilarious

2312.72 --> 2319.2
it's weird you know i'm thinking about

2316.32 --> 2319.839
like okay if they really somehow want to

2319.2 --> 2323.5989999999997
maneuver

2319.839 --> 2325.7599999999998
aliens onto the scene right

2323.599 --> 2328.56
obviously the backstory is going to be

2325.76 --> 2330.079
complete fake

2328.56 --> 2332.48
but who knows what they're going to

2330.079 --> 2335.92
bring forth as actual

2332.48 --> 2336.56
like live alien like they might keep the

2335.92 --> 2340.0
whole thing

2336.56 --> 2342.7999999999997
as like a military secret in the shadows

2340.0 --> 2344.079
just let the stories of supposed contact

2342.8 --> 2345.8390000000004
out there

2344.079 --> 2348.48
but they might at some point actually

2345.839 --> 2353.2
decide to have

2348.48 --> 2355.68
like aliens or like in between aliens or

2353.2 --> 2357.359
basically altered humanoids as sort of

2355.68 --> 2360.72
representatives or something

2357.359 --> 2364.3199999999997
right it's like even in sci-fi

2360.72 --> 2367.359
series way back they sort of did this

2364.32 --> 2369.119
in there the idea like oh a bridge in

2367.359 --> 2370.88
between

2369.119 --> 2374.1600000000003
but who knows like they might actually

2370.88 --> 2374.1600000000003
have gone ahead and just

2375.28 --> 2380.88
taken a group of people that are like

2378.48 --> 2384.4
instructed like you are the aliens and

2380.88 --> 2386.48
we're gonna genetically modify you

2384.4 --> 2388.8
not to look really different but to have

2386.48 --> 2391.04
a different physiology

2388.8 --> 2392.2400000000002
in ways maybe they'll be like fully

2391.04 --> 2397.599
magnetic or something

2392.24 --> 2399.5989999999997
who knows what right it

2397.599 --> 2400.8
so yeah they might like introduce a

2399.599 --> 2402.8
group of people

2400.8 --> 2404.88
that kind of look a little weird but

2402.8 --> 2408.96
still human

2404.88 --> 2412.48
that are different like really different

2408.96 --> 2415.52
like they might eat different

2412.48 --> 2418.319
they feel different might have weird

2415.52 --> 2418.319
abilities

2419.119 --> 2425.839
who knows

2428.4 --> 2441.599
they will promise everlasting

2439.359 --> 2443.2799999999997
yeah maybe it will really be maneuvered

2441.599 --> 2445.119
eventually

2443.28 --> 2446.6400000000003
to this ridiculous setup where it is

2445.119 --> 2450.56
like okay you want to be an

2446.64 --> 2454.0789999999997
alien like us well take this vaccine

2450.56 --> 2454.0789999999997
and then you'll become one of us

2454.16 --> 2458.0789999999997
super ominous of course but hey since

2457.04 --> 2460.16
people actually

2458.079 --> 2461.119
are willing to double down on something

2460.16 --> 2464.56
they know

2461.119 --> 2465.599
probably going to kill them the corona

2464.56 --> 2468.0789999999997
vaccines then

2465.599 --> 2470.1600000000003
well people will probably also engage

2468.079 --> 2471.28
like within the same range of people

2470.16 --> 2474.56
there will probably

2471.28 --> 2481.8390000000004
be plenty that will try that out

2474.56 --> 2481.839
so uh

2485.68 --> 2491.2799999999997
right the alien facts to cure humanity

2488.48 --> 2495.04
to change you it is something else

2491.28 --> 2509.8390000000004
can't get more freaky mark of the beast

2495.04 --> 2509.839
than that

2515.28 --> 2523.8390000000004
they will want to die but death will

2517.68 --> 2523.839
flee from them that sounds really creepy

2530.72 --> 2535.359
that literally sounds really freaky the

2533.28 --> 2538.3190000000004
idea of that neil like

2535.359 --> 2540.16
that you literally would be so

2538.319 --> 2543.04
impervious

2540.16 --> 2545.68
that you couldn't die but that at the

2543.04 --> 2545.68
same time

2547.76 --> 2554.079
you would kind of be done with it

2550.96 --> 2556.16
you would reach that point

2554.079 --> 2558.079
of your spirit where you're like no i

2556.16 --> 2559.44
i'm done with this life i want to move

2558.079 --> 2562.1600000000003
on right

2559.44 --> 2562.88
and then you get stuck that's that

2562.16 --> 2565.839
sounds like

2562.88 --> 2565.839
hell

2567.04 --> 2569.359
yes

2571.52 --> 2576.16
like you're alive but you can't maneuver

2574.48 --> 2579.839
yourself to actually live

2576.16 --> 2579.839
but you can't die either

2589.15 --> 2593.839
[Music]

2590.839 --> 2593.839
creepy

2605.599 --> 2613.2000000000003
right well pat fee

2609.04 --> 2616.64
wouldn't that be extremely easy to test

2613.2 --> 2619.52
whether the aliens know about jesus

2616.64 --> 2620.7999999999997
breaking away bring him up and see how

2619.52 --> 2624.16
they'll respond

2620.8 --> 2626.6400000000003
if they're like huh oh is that

2624.16 --> 2628.64
okay that's that sounds kind of

2626.64 --> 2631.839
interesting and wise and

2628.64 --> 2634.16
this is pretty heavy don't know

2631.839 --> 2636.24
right then they probably really wouldn't

2634.16 --> 2639.44
know but if they'll be like

2636.24 --> 2641.2799999999997
yeah we don't want to hear about that

2639.44 --> 2644.4
or we've been warned about it or

2641.28 --> 2644.4
something then you know

2645.44 --> 2649.599
they have a deflective response then

2647.28 --> 2663.8390000000004
they must have heard about it

2649.599 --> 2663.839
somehow in some way through someone

2672.24 --> 2677.839
do they know about the buddha

2684.64 --> 2687.68
well i'd be interested to know if buddha

2686.64 --> 2690.56
really was a

2687.68 --> 2691.359
a person too right there's all kinds of

2690.56 --> 2693.92
amazing

2691.359 --> 2693.92
figures

2696.0 --> 2700.4
out there in the world throughout

2697.92 --> 2700.7200000000003
history i'm very curious about all of

2700.4 --> 2703.76
them

2700.72 --> 2707.1189999999997
to know like were they like fabric

2703.76 --> 2707.119
a fabricated legend

2707.839 --> 2711.44
as an example for people to mirror

2710.4 --> 2715.76
themselves to

2711.44 --> 2715.76
or were they actually really that person

2717.04 --> 2720.079
and and why what was that is there some

2719.599 --> 2733.839
real

2720.079 --> 2733.8390000000004
heavy mystical thing about it

2757.119 --> 2763.359
oh george sanford where where well

2760.88 --> 2765.52
i still remember during the x-files

2763.359 --> 2769.52
times

2765.52 --> 2772.4
late 90s that there like

2769.52 --> 2774.079
it got really popular and lots of people

2772.4 --> 2778.4
were into it and a lot of people

2774.079 --> 2781.04
did like put

2778.4 --> 2781.839
god in christ on the back burner or even

2781.04 --> 2785.359
like

2781.839 --> 2789.599
used it to discard them in order to

2785.359 --> 2792.0
pursue the the alien dream

2789.599 --> 2793.76
and the idea of outer space and like a

2792.0 --> 2796.8
futurist society

2793.76 --> 2803.8390000000004
that sort of dream

2796.8 --> 2803.8390000000004
so yeah neil is actually right

2804.079 --> 2808.8
revealing of aliens and building it into

2806.56 --> 2811.359
a thing

2808.8 --> 2813.6800000000003
in the media yeah it does actually make

2811.359 --> 2813.68
people

2814.72 --> 2819.4399999999996
get fascinated get bound by some dream

2817.839 --> 2822.4
idea in relation to it

2819.44 --> 2822.4
and then pursue that

2827.76 --> 2832.079
i've i've never seen any kind of

2836.8 --> 2841.8390000000004
alien story alien contact story where

2842.4 --> 2845.44
the aliens would be compatible with

2844.48 --> 2848.4
christ

2845.44 --> 2850.2400000000002
serious have you ever seen that like

2848.4 --> 2851.92
even if you like take the grey aliens

2850.24 --> 2855.839
and you take jesus christ like

2851.92 --> 2857.6800000000003
it's like how does that word that

2855.839 --> 2859.839
that's not supposed to that's like two

2857.68 --> 2873.68
different stories

2859.839 --> 2875.92
they don't fit

2873.68 --> 2876.8799999999997
or yeah jesus would probably just call

2875.92 --> 2887.839
them like

2876.88 --> 2887.839
demonic monsters

2900.0 --> 2906.64
well pat fee if they'd actually say that

2902.48 --> 2906.64
then they are completely deluded

2907.2 --> 2912.72
because then they obviously don't

2908.88 --> 2916.0
understand what it actually is

2912.72 --> 2918.48
right god's god creation

2916.0 --> 2919.359
all of it has to do with the origin of

2918.48 --> 2921.359
the spirit

2919.359 --> 2923.92
because it is really created and even if

2921.359 --> 2929.839
aliens did exist

2923.92 --> 2929.839
then they were originally created too

2930.0 --> 2938.16
so any society that would say well we're

2933.76 --> 2943.8390000000004
beyond the idea of a creator

2938.16 --> 2943.839
are literally delusional fools

2945.92 --> 2949.76
or they might be gaslighting their

2947.76 --> 2953.119
targets like think yeah

2949.76 --> 2955.0400000000004
no you're not worthy to share that level

2953.119 --> 2956.079
of information with so we're gonna give

2955.04 --> 2958.72
you the atheist

2956.079 --> 2960.88
treatment pretend like we're atheists

2958.72 --> 2965.2
because you probably

2960.88 --> 2965.2000000000003
can't handle this level of truth

2965.839 --> 2970.0
if it was actually a genuine type of

2968.079 --> 2985.8390000000004
alien civilization

2970.0 --> 2985.839
which it's probably not

2991.2 --> 2997.68
oh pat feed it it depends on the context

2995.839 --> 3000.0
right which of the gods might they

2997.68 --> 3003.359
believe in you mean

3000.0 --> 3005.76
physically reify

3003.359 --> 3007.119
why would they do that but would they

3005.76 --> 3010.7200000000003
understand

3007.119 --> 3013.76
what the gods in the stories

3010.72 --> 3014.64
actually stand for represent well they

3013.76 --> 3017.8390000000004
might actually

3014.64 --> 3018.5589999999997
understand that why are you straw

3017.839 --> 3021.359
manning

3018.559 --> 3022.88
these supposed advanced aliens into

3021.359 --> 3026.0
thinking that they would be

3022.88 --> 3029.6800000000003
such short-sighted atheists about

3026.0 --> 3033.76
it and only get all savage about oh

3029.68 --> 3033.7599999999998
refining into physical reality

3038.72 --> 3044.72
right all these 10 000 gods to me

3041.839 --> 3044.72
are all just

3044.96 --> 3052.839
spiritual manifestation fragments of the

3049.04 --> 3054.48
potentially the divine arms of the

3052.839 --> 3058.64
divine

3054.48 --> 3058.64
manifestations representations

3059.52 --> 3063.2
different cultural angles to it

3061.839 --> 3066.4
different spirit

3063.2 --> 3069.4399999999996
loads bound to the cultures

3066.4 --> 3070.0
they're adapted to yeah that's how i see

3069.44 --> 3072.16
it

3070.0 --> 3073.28
why wouldn't the aliens see it like that

3072.16 --> 3083.839
unless they were

3073.28 --> 3083.8390000000004
really short-sighted atheists

3091.359 --> 3097.839
hello psychics traveler

3119.2 --> 3123.04
i don't know what you mean with that

3121.2 --> 3125.359
psychics traveler

3123.04 --> 3127.44
a world full of villains perpetuate the

3125.359 --> 3129.7599999999998
belief of the bible

3127.44 --> 3130.7200000000003
it begs the question for superhero

3129.76 --> 3139.8390000000004
wearing tights i

3130.72 --> 3139.839
i don't see that at all

3140.48 --> 3144.88
now i think superhero wearing tights

3143.44 --> 3147.839
basically comes from

3144.88 --> 3150.88
boys a young age having a lot of fantasy

3147.839 --> 3153.839
playing with dolls

3150.88 --> 3153.839
right

3154.0 --> 3159.119
action figures but the fantasy that

3157.04 --> 3161.2
springs they're from

3159.119 --> 3163.2000000000003
so you can also anchor it kind of into

3161.2 --> 3164.8799999999997
the age range of the mindset that it's

3163.2 --> 3167.2
anchored into

3164.88 --> 3168.7200000000003
right it's kind of the same it flows

3167.2 --> 3181.839
into comics

3168.72 --> 3181.839
that h

3195.599 --> 3199.44
the true origin of the realm we live

3198.319 --> 3202.96
god's fine

3199.44 --> 3206.0
you don't understand pathy you don't

3202.96 --> 3209.599
understand you can't be

3206.0 --> 3212.96
here if it wasn't for a creator

3209.599 --> 3216.1600000000003
you wouldn't get any ideas if it wasn't

3212.96 --> 3218.48
appointed to you

3216.16 --> 3220.24
through the akashic library which god

3218.48 --> 3222.16
designed

3220.24 --> 3237.839
how the ideas get spread around how you

3222.16 --> 3237.839
come to new ideas

3276.839 --> 3293.839
so this is getting a little silly

3302.0 --> 3311.119
well no savior is coming or maybe

3307.119 --> 3311.119
maybe that's not entirely true

3314.24 --> 3320.64
maybe xavier can come through

3317.44 --> 3323.76
you like jesus

3320.64 --> 3323.7599999999998
basically foretold

3324.079 --> 3331.3590000000004
like his teachings are an invite

3328.319 --> 3334.88
it's like get with the program

3331.359 --> 3338.0
you can get very good at this

3334.88 --> 3339.119
right and when they say christ return to

3338.0 --> 3343.2
me

3339.119 --> 3346.319
yeah there might be some physical figure

3343.2 --> 3349.4399999999996
whatever coming back might be but

3346.319 --> 3351.359
to me the actual spirit of christ and

3349.44 --> 3353.68
the ideas and

3351.359 --> 3355.7599999999998
frequency of it is much more important

3353.68 --> 3359.2799999999997
well it can come back

3355.76 --> 3360.2400000000002
through you with all the all the powers

3359.28 --> 3363.76
that come with it

3360.24 --> 3363.7599999999998
and the responsibilities and the

3374.839 --> 3377.839
realizations

3410.079 --> 3415.119
big bang is akin to a tornado through a

3413.119 --> 3419.6800000000003
junkyard building a fleet

3415.119 --> 3433.839
of 747s yeah that's

3419.68 --> 3433.839
that's putting it mildly

3435.359 --> 3439.359
but it's even weirder tony whitcomb when

3437.28 --> 3441.44
you realize that still

3439.359 --> 3442.799
it's held on to that there is infinite

3441.44 --> 3445.359
volume

3442.799 --> 3446.24
if there's infinite volume then how

3445.359 --> 3451.52
could if

3446.24 --> 3455.2
the the explosion of plasma

3451.52 --> 3460.0
and yeah into everything

3455.2 --> 3463.5989999999997
how could it have settled

3460.0 --> 3467.359
found equilibrium

3463.599 --> 3469.04
within their space if the volume is

3467.359 --> 3470.96
infinite

3469.04 --> 3473.2
if the volume of the universe would be

3470.96 --> 3476.0
infinite that the big bang could never

3473.2 --> 3477.2
settle because it wouldn't be just

3476.0 --> 3480.48
exploding

3477.2 --> 3483.2
eternally right it would big bang

3480.48 --> 3484.2400000000002
theory in order for it to remotely work

3483.2 --> 3487.359
there has to be

3484.24 --> 3490.72
literally a limited

3487.359 --> 3494.96
container volume for the universe

3490.72 --> 3498.0
all of it within that this space

3494.96 --> 3499.28
it would have to be or yeah the the

3498.0 --> 3502.24
plasma and all that

3499.28 --> 3503.44
from the original explosion could never

3502.24 --> 3506.8799999999997
be able to

3503.44 --> 3506.88
settle within space

3507.599 --> 3512.2400000000002
you need a limited volume for that like

3509.92 --> 3514.4
even when you try to demonstrate similar

3512.24 --> 3517.1189999999997
effects

3514.4 --> 3519.76
here on earth you have to have

3517.119 --> 3519.76
containment

3521.2 --> 3527.52
gases or plasma they can't settle

3524.48 --> 3532.559
without a container

3527.52 --> 3536.24
explode something it spreads out it

3532.559 --> 3538.48
goes yeah it settles that can only

3536.24 --> 3539.2
happen if there is a limited volume to

3538.48 --> 3541.119
settle in

3539.2 --> 3542.8799999999997
if there's infinite volume it can't

3541.119 --> 3546.079
settle

3542.88 --> 3547.76
it's just gonna

3546.079 --> 3550.319
spread out thinner and thinner and

3547.76 --> 3552.0
thinner and thinner all that plasma

3550.319 --> 3553.68
from the original explosion it's just

3552.0 --> 3556.839
literally gonna be boom

3553.68 --> 3559.839
and it's gone no time to settle for

3556.839 --> 3559.839
anything

3562.64 --> 3566.64
does the bible provide any effort no

3564.96 --> 3569.04
this is physics

3566.64 --> 3570.72
this is just physics bad fee not the

3569.04 --> 3575.04
bible

3570.72 --> 3575.04
this is all presupposing the big bang

3575.92 --> 3580.48
right the physics mechanics of the idea

3579.28 --> 3583.3590000000004
of the big bang

3580.48 --> 3583.359
that's a problem

3585.2 --> 3589.359
there was originally a an explosion of

3588.319 --> 3593.44
matter

3589.359 --> 3596.16
and plasma form extreme extremities

3593.44 --> 3596.799
in order yeah to spread out and then

3596.16 --> 3601.2799999999997
settle

3596.799 --> 3604.64
and form suns and nebulas and

3601.28 --> 3606.7200000000003
eventually planets and moons that

3604.64 --> 3608.0789999999997
could only be possible if there was a

3606.72 --> 3611.68
limited volume

3608.079 --> 3614.559
specific specific not not arbitrary

3611.68 --> 3617.2
specific limited volume to the container

3614.559 --> 3619.2000000000003
of the universe

3617.2 --> 3620.799
because that's how pressure dynamics

3619.2 --> 3624.5589999999997
work like things only

3620.799 --> 3624.559
settle if they're pressurized

3625.119 --> 3631.92
if they find a stable pressure things

3627.599 --> 3631.92
don't settle if they don't find a stable

3640.839 --> 3643.839
pressure

3659.359 --> 3665.92
right yes tony whitcomb yeah the fish

3662.799 --> 3667.52
oh [ __ ] deep ocean fish and the weird

3665.92 --> 3670.0
thing is is that

3667.52 --> 3672.64
if you bring them up they die because

3670.0 --> 3675.2
they depressurize

3672.64 --> 3678.48
but they're specifically designed to be

3675.2 --> 3678.48
in that heavy pressure

3678.559 --> 3684.48
it's it's kind of like us stealth

3682.839 --> 3688.24
fighters

3684.48 --> 3688.64
like they are specifically designed to

3688.24 --> 3690.9599999999996
go

3688.64 --> 3692.5589999999997
at those extreme speeds because when

3690.96 --> 3695.839
they stand still

3692.559 --> 3698.88
they bleed literally like they bleed

3695.839 --> 3700.64
the fuel and [ __ ] it just goes through

3698.88 --> 3702.4
through the matter because the matter

3700.64 --> 3704.16
that it's made of is very unique

3702.4 --> 3707.599
material

3704.16 --> 3710.3999999999996
and it kind of bleeds until you put

3707.599 --> 3712.079
the specific types of forces onto it

3710.4 --> 3713.28
that it's going to be exposed to when

3712.079 --> 3716.1600000000003
it's flying

3713.28 --> 3718.3190000000004
at those high speeds and then suddenly

3716.16 --> 3720.799
it all just compacts

3718.319 --> 3724.4
so stealth fighters are kind of in a way

3720.799 --> 3726.4
just like those deep sea fish

3724.4 --> 3728.48
if you just bring them out in the normal

3726.4 --> 3730.2400000000002
yeah they're dysfunctional the fish is

3728.48 --> 3732.88
gonna die the stealth fighter is just

3730.24 --> 3732.8799999999997
gonna bleed

3733.119 --> 3737.52
but under where it's in the conditions

3735.92 --> 3738.4
where it's supposed to be that's where

3737.52 --> 3741.7599999999998
suddenly

3738.4 --> 3755.839
the matter is exactly optimal

3741.76 --> 3755.8390000000004
to that scenario interesting isn't it

3766.16 --> 3771.2
like seriously the guy that just came up

3769.039 --> 3774.4
with the idea of the stealth fighter

3771.2 --> 3776.0
of it to function like that is like a

3774.4 --> 3779.039
kind of a mad genius

3776.0 --> 3781.119
it's really like like who comes up with

3779.039 --> 3784.1600000000003
that sort of thing

3781.119 --> 3784.96
an airplane that just bleeds but when

3784.16 --> 3787.52
it's in

3784.96 --> 3789.28
in in action that's suddenly where it

3787.52 --> 3790.72
just comes together like who comes up

3789.28 --> 3797.8390000000004
with that

3790.72 --> 3797.839
guys that's some wild thinking

3827.76 --> 3830.88
no magnetic physics degree oh well do

3830.559 --> 3832.96
you

3830.88 --> 3839.839
pat fee do you hold a physics degree do

3832.96 --> 3839.839
you hold a physics degree zero skip

3846.4 --> 3853.839
yes i know pat fee

3881.359 --> 3887.44
uh jeto air tray

3889.68 --> 3896.96
you don't like it you don't like that i

3894.4 --> 3897.52
what you say i don't even say that know

3896.96 --> 3899.68
everything

3897.52 --> 3901.2
better than everybody else well do you

3899.68 --> 3905.44
have anything to

3901.2 --> 3907.0389999999998
refute do you have an argument to refute

3905.44 --> 3908.799
anything i say

3907.039 --> 3910.7990000000004
because that's what the chat is for if

3908.799 --> 3914.079
you disagree with anything i said

3910.799 --> 3919.2
specifically why don't you present

3914.079 --> 3922.6400000000003
a counter argument you know a rebuttal

3919.2 --> 3925.1189999999997
instead of just like oh you're so smart

3922.64 --> 3927.5989999999997
yeah well until you actually give some

3925.119 --> 3930.7200000000003
kind of a response to prove otherwise

3927.599 --> 3936.559
yeah yeah i am chateau

3930.72 --> 3940.0
era three yeah

3936.559 --> 3940.0
who retracted his message

3942.88 --> 3947.119
right and i had physics in school and i

3945.2 --> 3949.1189999999997
was always very interested in physics

3947.119 --> 3965.839
even after school

3949.119 --> 3965.839
i wanted to be a scientist

3967.039 --> 3970.96
and yeah my brother helped out with that

3969.119 --> 3973.839
as well because he was kind of serious

3970.96 --> 3973.839
about it as well

3974.24 --> 3979.839
and he did go to university

3982.319 --> 3993.839
space elves are real though really

4002.88 --> 4007.839
why didn't i go to university then well

4005.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
it's because

4007.92 --> 4012.88
language requirements

4010.96 --> 4015.039
i was never good at languages and the

4012.88 --> 4017.359
only way to get to a university if

4015.039 --> 4018.4
is if i like did like four different

4017.359 --> 4023.2
languages

4018.4 --> 4023.2000000000003
and i just i really didn't want to do it

4026.4 --> 4033.44
and also i didn't really get along

4030.4 --> 4033.44
with just people

4033.76 --> 4037.599
that we're going there again i thought

4037.119 --> 4039.92
that

4037.599 --> 4042.48
most of them were kind of arrogant i

4039.92 --> 4044.319
didn't like it i didn't feel appreciated

4042.48 --> 4046.2400000000002
well in the class where i did actually

4044.319 --> 4050.88
move into

4046.24 --> 4050.8799999999997
i did feel a lot more appreciated

4050.96 --> 4055.599
and i learned a lot i learned a lot

4052.88 --> 4055.599
about people

4057.28 --> 4062.3190000000004
right but yeah i was like a bit of a

4060.96 --> 4064.2400000000002
weirdo anyway you know

4062.319 --> 4065.7599999999998
like i had those moments especially in

4064.24 --> 4068.72
the final years where

4065.76 --> 4070.88
i would barely go to class and then i

4068.72 --> 4074.319
have these fond memories

4070.88 --> 4076.7200000000003
of going to math class

4074.319 --> 4077.68
like after not being there for like

4076.72 --> 4080.3999999999996
weeks

4077.68 --> 4082.16
getting in there seeing a whole bunch of

4080.4 --> 4083.119
classmates sitting there like with

4082.16 --> 4087.2799999999997
headaches and like

4083.119 --> 4090.0
ah and then the teacher

4087.28 --> 4090.559
obviously being stuck into the high

4090.0 --> 4092.4
level

4090.559 --> 4094.7200000000003
mathematical thinking with all the

4092.4 --> 4096.4800000000005
formulas trying to explain something

4094.72 --> 4101.759
relatively simple

4096.48 --> 4105.12
so i just got in there took a bench

4101.759 --> 4108.239
like listened for 10 minutes then

4105.12 --> 4110.96
suddenly out of nowhere i spoke up like

4108.239 --> 4112.239
is this what you mean right guys because

4110.96 --> 4113.44
he's been talking about this and this

4112.239 --> 4115.199
and this feeding him back

4113.44 --> 4117.04
what he was saying and then like you're

4115.199 --> 4119.44
trying to actually explain this but

4117.04 --> 4121.92
holding on to these

4119.44 --> 4123.5199999999995
these elements to keep it mathematically

4121.92 --> 4125.279
correct which is something you think is

4123.52 --> 4127.839000000001
really important

4125.279 --> 4128.96
instead of focusing on trying to help

4127.839 --> 4133.12
these students to

4128.96 --> 4135.44
understand what what the problem is

4133.12 --> 4136.4
and then everybody would be like what

4135.44 --> 4140.5599999999995
taking notes

4136.4 --> 4144.3189999999995
is those were the days man

4140.56 --> 4147.679
because i just had a feel for it

4144.319 --> 4150.159000000001
like i don't get stuck in like

4147.679 --> 4154.4
mathematical puzzles

4150.159 --> 4154.4
but i get a feel for the structure of it

4155.52 --> 4159.359
and i did fine with math like i barely

4158.239 --> 4161.839
went to class

4159.359 --> 4163.1990000000005
but i did fine with it because i had a

4161.839 --> 4165.6
really good feel for it

4163.199 --> 4168.08
i could just feel out like okay this

4165.6 --> 4172.159000000001
feels like it's

4168.08 --> 4172.799
the right pattern for the answer of this

4172.159 --> 4174.48
question

4172.799 --> 4177.04
like there's this percentage of

4174.48 --> 4178.718999999999
likelihood that this pattern is actually

4177.04 --> 4180.64
associated with the question

4178.719 --> 4182.56
so i wouldn't actually freaking

4180.64 --> 4185.679
calculate it

4182.56 --> 4188.88
a lot of the times no calculator

4185.679 --> 4192.08
yeah i do it

4188.88 --> 4194.8
through pattern recognition that's how i

4192.08 --> 4200.32
got through math

4194.8 --> 4200.320000000001
pretty good right with the seven

4200.4 --> 4206.0
on my exam

4203.6 --> 4206.0
huh

4206.64 --> 4212.2390000000005
and with physics i had a six

4209.76 --> 4214.0
but i had a lot of trouble with physics

4212.239 --> 4216.08
back in the time because there was also

4214.0 --> 4217.92
things like electronics and that really

4216.08 --> 4221.04
confused the [ __ ] out of me at the time

4217.92 --> 4223.92
i wasn't ready for it yet

4221.04 --> 4223.92
and other things

4225.679 --> 4230.719
not very likely well dude i will dig up

4229.04 --> 4234.159
my actual diploma

4230.719 --> 4236.2390000000005
at some point because it is true

4234.159 --> 4238.239
everything that i just said is true and

4236.239 --> 4239.919999999999
literally picking it out of genuine

4238.239 --> 4243.28
original memory

4239.92 --> 4246.88
that is true that yes it is

4243.28 --> 4246.88
i'm sorry if you can deal with it

4248.28 --> 4252.889999999999
[Music]

4253.04 --> 4260.08
yeah graduated

4256.84 --> 4263.1990000000005
physics math

4260.08 --> 4267.04
biology english

4263.199 --> 4267.04
dutch and art

4268.159 --> 4286.639999999999
it's kind of weird in between there but

4270.32 --> 4289.679
i insisted i was very much about the art

4286.64 --> 4291.84
hey thanks good servant for the 99 super

4289.679 --> 4300.0
chat donation

4291.84 --> 4303.28
big smile

4300.0 --> 4303.28
you out of the hospital yet

4307.679 --> 4315.84
i can get home today right today oh yeah

4311.679 --> 4315.84
exciting times

4344.64 --> 4349.280000000001
do i have any artwork that i can show

4346.56 --> 4349.280000000001
absolutely

4349.84 --> 4359.12
i have i have shown it on this show

4356.159 --> 4359.92
most of it is still like in storage

4359.12 --> 4362.8
seriously

4359.92 --> 4364.96
it's just in storage that way it keeps

4362.8 --> 4367.6
kind of safe and dry

4364.96 --> 4369.28
but i got some scanned things on my

4367.6 --> 4371.84
computer even

4369.28 --> 4371.84
that i've shared

4378.719 --> 4381.76
it's just that

4382.8 --> 4387.4400000000005
i like the things that i made in school

4385.6 --> 4388.8
but i also did kind of like painting

4387.44 --> 4391.839999999999
after that

4388.8 --> 4394.0
this was decent it's just i never felt

4391.84 --> 4398.159000000001
like yeah i'm good enough

4394.0 --> 4398.64
this like i knew i could do better but i

4398.159 --> 4402.719
couldn't

4398.64 --> 4402.719
get it and that was too frustrating

4406.08 --> 4409.84
so i kind of like stopped doing it and

4408.8 --> 4413.04
started to

4409.84 --> 4416.32
then deviate to more patternism

4413.04 --> 4419.92
speech art and psychology

4416.32 --> 4424.799999999999
and yeah those grounds

4419.92 --> 4429.04
how i have succeeded and developed

4424.8 --> 4440.4800000000005
so that was a good choice anyway

4429.04 --> 4442.8
let's see if i can find some

4440.48 --> 4442.799999999999
hmm

4452.719 --> 4456.719
right no i don't have anything from my

4454.719 --> 4458.88
graduation day

4456.719 --> 4460.88
like i had this wrong it's really big i

4458.88 --> 4469.84
think i showed it once

4460.88 --> 4469.84
it's like really big pencil drawing

4471.76 --> 4476.719
what have you been up to after college

4474.719 --> 4479.76
i'm 41 years old

4476.719 --> 4479.76
it's been a long time

4481.52 --> 4497.84
but what have i been up to after that

4500.159 --> 4507.12
i was just very preoccupied

4503.199 --> 4510.48
with my own things so

4507.12 --> 4513.599999999999
i really tried for a long time to

4510.48 --> 4515.839999999999
like get into game design

4513.6 --> 4517.76
i really like that i've always been

4515.84 --> 4519.360000000001
drawing computer games but yeah i kind

4517.76 --> 4521.84
of got rejected

4519.36 --> 4521.839999999999
twice

4523.36 --> 4530.239
and well after all that

4526.88 --> 4533.28
i kind of turned towards the

4530.239 --> 4537.199
conspiracy theory

4533.28 --> 4539.679
just i'm 41

4537.199 --> 4539.678999999999
ajm

4550.84 --> 4553.84
right

4559.199 --> 4567.839999999999
graphic artist by trade okay cool

4570.159 --> 4574.96
what led him down the path of religion

4572.32 --> 4574.96
and flat earth

4578.84 --> 4584.64
necessity

4581.44 --> 4585.839999999999
but yeah like after i kind of turned to

4584.64 --> 4588.88
goldsmithing

4585.84 --> 4589.4400000000005
in the middle of yeah being conspired no

4588.88 --> 4592.64
no

4589.44 --> 4594.0
great goldsmithing came first it's my

4592.64 --> 4597.52
first attempt to really

4594.0 --> 4597.52
try to do something again

4597.84 --> 4601.28
i got really good it hey i still wear

4600.48 --> 4604.5599999999995
things

4601.28 --> 4608.719
i make to this day right so it really

4604.56 --> 4610.64
seems like yeah that's a good choice

4608.719 --> 4614.8
and then as i was engaging with that

4610.64 --> 4614.8
that's when i got into conspiracy theory

4615.6 --> 4621.52
and the internet more it's like

4618.96 --> 4622.96
around 2005 that's when i really got

4621.52 --> 4625.4400000000005
into it

4622.96 --> 4625.44
and then

4629.12 --> 4634.159
yeah eventually bumped into flat earth

4634.4 --> 4639.5199999999995
then it and then bump to it into it

4637.199 --> 4639.5199999999995
again

4639.679 --> 4645.36
but the religion part like i've even

4643.04 --> 4646.32
during my goldsmithing days i was kind

4645.36 --> 4649.599999999999
of like

4646.32 --> 4652.4
did spiritual exploration it was really

4649.6 --> 4653.280000000001
doing like a spiritual quest to try and

4652.4 --> 4656.719
understand

4653.28 --> 4658.88
well symbols at first but also religion

4656.719 --> 4661.28
and what it does to people's minds and

4658.88 --> 4661.28
all that

4662.84 --> 4668.159000000001
right so i guess

4665.199 --> 4668.159
in a way from

4668.88 --> 4674.0
a very fuzzy sort of atheist but not

4671.76 --> 4679.84
really atheist perspective

4674.0 --> 4679.84
it's like this weird mix-up

4680.32 --> 4685.36
god doesn't exist but he's there based

4682.88 --> 4693.84
on that original idea

4685.36 --> 4693.839999999999
which i actually said when i was five

4704.08 --> 4721.84
hmm weed whackers

4738.4 --> 4743.04
right well yeah i've never followed a

4740.719 --> 4745.52
religion i've tried to make a personal

4743.04 --> 4745.5199999999995
religion

4746.32 --> 4749.84
it's more like a personal tradition

4752.159 --> 4758.0
like it's all about taking what you do

4755.199 --> 4758.32
very seriously and as a responsibility

4758.0 --> 4763.84
to

4758.32 --> 4763.84
the universe or god either way is fine

4769.6 --> 4776.2390000000005
and then through doing that for a while

4773.52 --> 4778.0
holding on to it that's when eventually

4776.239 --> 4780.959999999999
well

4778.0 --> 4783.199
christ kind of opened up to me it's like

4780.96 --> 4786.159
to really show kind of like yeah

4783.199 --> 4786.639999999999
you're you're close enough to actually

4786.159 --> 4788.799999999999
start

4786.64 --> 4790.2390000000005
to start to really understand the wider

4788.8 --> 4792.56
depth of it

4790.239 --> 4794.08
even though i recognized it before

4792.56 --> 4797.120000000001
throughout my youth

4794.08 --> 4800.88
i always kind of feared it

4797.12 --> 4804.08
i did like respectfully

4800.88 --> 4808.159000000001
respectful but fearful just knew like

4804.08 --> 4815.28
i this is too much for me yeah

4808.159 --> 4819.28
but now yeah to uh 2015

4815.28 --> 4822.159
that's when yeah i i really was in it

4819.28 --> 4824.32
in a tight spot psychologically started

4822.159 --> 4826.4
to hallucinate even

4824.32 --> 4829.679
just doing really bad felt really bad

4826.4 --> 4834.5599999999995
about myself felt guilty and scared and

4829.679 --> 4838.0
yeah crazy [ __ ] from my past haunting me

4834.56 --> 4839.679
and then i went over to the the church

4838.0 --> 4842.0
of latter-day saints

4839.679 --> 4844.0
for the first time really in like help i

4842.0 --> 4846.4
need help and this is not something that

4844.0 --> 4848.639
a doctor or whatever can help

4846.4 --> 4850.32
they did a lay on hands and it worked it

4848.639 --> 4852.8
worked miracles

4850.32 --> 4854.08
and after that point i thought like okay

4852.8 --> 4856.2390000000005
now

4854.08 --> 4859.04
now i want to go to church and i did for

4856.239 --> 4859.04
like two years

4859.52 --> 4866.0
and right

4862.719 --> 4867.84
that's how i learned it again like from

4866.0 --> 4869.6
but from where an inside perspective and

4867.84 --> 4872.8
it's it's a great

4869.6 --> 4874.8
joy to be there with these people

4872.8 --> 4876.56
because they're all so great and nice

4874.8 --> 4879.84
and supportive

4876.56 --> 4882.639
but not patronizing right

4879.84 --> 4882.639
not like that

4883.28 --> 4886.32
they're they're pretty open-minded like

4885.6 --> 4889.4400000000005
even with

4886.32 --> 4891.84
complicated subjects

4889.44 --> 4892.719
so yeah i felt really appreciated even

4891.84 --> 4895.76
there

4892.719 --> 4896.639
but then eventually i like got more

4895.76 --> 4898.719
serious

4896.639 --> 4900.0
with my own religion with the idea of

4898.719 --> 4904.96
the path

4900.0 --> 4904.96
and actually avoiding organized religion

4905.36 --> 4909.04
and then i kind of stepped away again

4906.88 --> 4910.639
and then the corona crisis

4909.04 --> 4912.159
nonsense started to hit and they

4910.639 --> 4916.32
basically just closed

4912.159 --> 4918.799999999999
they stopped so it was crazy the timing

4916.32 --> 4918.799999999999
of it all

4918.96 --> 4923.36
but they helped a lot for me to really

4921.92 --> 4926.08
see

4923.36 --> 4928.0
church and christians more for what they

4926.08 --> 4932.08
really are what they can be

4928.0 --> 4932.08
and that like the problems with it

4933.36 --> 4937.5199999999995
in facing other people that aren't like

4935.84 --> 4940.8
that and the misunderstanding

4937.52 --> 4943.4400000000005
even from their side right it's it's all

4940.8 --> 4943.4400000000005
just people

4943.52 --> 4947.040000000001
right and these things i didn't

4944.96 --> 4949.36
understand like 20 years ago i really

4947.04 --> 4952.0
didn't

4949.36 --> 4952.88
i just saw like no they're all just

4952.0 --> 4954.48
idiots

4952.88 --> 4956.0
they're all mistaken they don't know

4954.48 --> 4957.678999999999
what they do

4956.0 --> 4960.32
they keep on chanting from their book

4957.679 --> 4964.639
but they don't understand what it means

4960.32 --> 4967.599999999999
but by thinking that way back

4964.639 --> 4968.08
i overlooked that yeah those things are

4967.6 --> 4972.320000000001
in there

4968.08 --> 4974.719
the chance but in between

4972.32 --> 4975.599999999999
they're still like having a pretty good

4974.719 --> 4979.36
life and

4975.6 --> 4979.360000000001
making pretty decent decisions

4979.679 --> 4984.8
have good morale so there's that

4982.8 --> 4987.84
well that's at least with the mormon

4984.8 --> 4987.84

5345.199 --> 5349.12
physical social interactions

5349.44 --> 5353.839999999999
it's just that i've never been that guy

5351.679 --> 5357.1990000000005
that just goes out on my own

5353.84 --> 5359.360000000001
and just goes to a bar like i every time

5357.199 --> 5363.36
i go somewhere completely on my own

5359.36 --> 5365.12
it i always feel so awkward

5363.36 --> 5367.36
and i've never been able to get rid of

5365.12 --> 5367.36
that

5368.48 --> 5374.718999999999
if i'm with friends then suddenly i

5371.76 --> 5376.159000000001
have a composure in relation to those

5374.719 --> 5379.76
friends

5376.159 --> 5382.08
then i know how to act

5379.76 --> 5384.159000000001
if i'm completely on my own i literally

5382.08 --> 5384.639
don't know how to compose myself like

5384.159 --> 5387.5199999999995
that

5384.639 --> 5389.84
unless i'm it doing something like i'm

5387.52 --> 5392.719
going for groceries

5389.84 --> 5394.8
i have a root i have a plan and then i

5394.8 --> 5401.4400000000005
if i'm just going out

5401.44 --> 5406.239
that

5402.48 --> 5410.5599999999995

5437.84 --> 5442.96
insects

5439.76 --> 5442.96
look at people

5445.679 --> 5450.719
since i am a bit of a celebrity

5452.8 --> 5465.6
i don't really think so i think the

5462.56 --> 5468.159000000001
people out here really don't know

5465.6 --> 5468.159000000001
what i do

5474.239 --> 5479.919999999999
i mean i don't look like a a wussy or

5477.84 --> 5483.12
something

5479.92 --> 5485.1990000000005
i have some charisma as well a nice

5483.12 --> 5491.84
mustache

5485.199 --> 5491.839999999999

5494.32 --> 5498.239

the elven wizard or something no

5501.679 --> 5506.159
i've i don't think i've ever seen

5504.08 --> 5508.4
anybody really recognize me out there or

5506.159 --> 5512.0
maybe they did

5508.4 --> 5514.5599999999995
but then they didn't really know

5512.0 --> 5515.679
what to do with it it would be like oh

5514.56 --> 5517.76
it's that guy and then

5515.679 --> 5520.0
like kind of nervous or something i

5517.76 --> 5522.0
don't know it's it's tough sometimes i

5520.0 --> 5524.159
think that i might be getting recognized

5522.0 --> 5524.159
but

5526.4 --> 5529.839999999999
so far it has not happened except with

5528.719 --> 5533.199
like a

5529.84 --> 5535.04
wife of ara kill the hope like she

5533.199 --> 5537.28
recognized me and like hey you're the

5535.04 --> 5541.36
one with the youtube channel

5537.28 --> 5547.84
my husband watches you that was like oh

yeah black adder was great indeed

5601.6 --> 5604.320000000001
hilarious

5607.199 --> 5610.32
i had the best time in school too

5609.36 --> 5613.839999999999
because

5610.32 --> 5616.96
my english teacher he loved

5613.84 --> 5617.28
black adder and monty python and he

5616.96 --> 5620.32
would

5617.28 --> 5622.719
actually show that in class

5620.32 --> 5626.32
black adder in class and i loved it it

5622.719 --> 5626.32
was like the best time of the day

5627.679 --> 5630.8
but he would also then ask questions

5630.08 --> 5632.48
like

5630.8 --> 5634.2390000000005
did you understand the cultural

5632.48 --> 5636.5599999999995
references

5634.239 --> 5638.4
do you understand what he meant here

5636.56 --> 5645.84
like he would test you too

5638.4 --> 5645.839999999999
it's great fun great fun

5647.28 --> 5651.599999999999
except for those that really didn't like

5649.52 --> 5659.84
black adder or british humor yeah to

5651.6 --> 5659.84

okay

5716.96 --> 5722.4800000000005
then jaren all right well i i could do

5726.84 --> 5729.84
it

5732.88 --> 5736.639
to base a hack how how come that old

5736.08 --> 5743.84
horse

5736.639 --> 5743.84
rad bow born

5747.36 --> 5751.28
spurs is underrated yeah but he's also a

5749.36 --> 5754.639
little bit devious

5751.28 --> 5756.08
but yes spurs has real especially

5754.639 --> 5759.119
psychology skills

5756.08 --> 5759.119
and speaking skills

5763.199 --> 5770.32
control that position how how how is he

5766.0 --> 5785.84
controlled opposition

5770.32 --> 5785.84
can you clarify your claim

5795.76 --> 5799.84
power lands arrive

5805.44 --> 5809.5199999999995
oh oh okay hold hot so are you saying

5808.88 --> 5815.6
that

5809.52 --> 5815.6
he's competing with math power land

5816.8 --> 5821.04
yeah because yeah there was definitely a

5818.719 --> 5821.44
competition they're both kind of savagne

5821.04 --> 5826.96
oh

5821.44 --> 5829.5199999999995
first first i'm the special boy yeah but

5826.96 --> 5832.08
how does that make him controlled

5829.52 --> 5835.040000000001
opposition

5832.08 --> 5837.119
like as a control opposition what has he

5835.04 --> 5839.28
ruined

5837.119 --> 5841.599999999999
i don't think he's ruined anything he's

5839.28 --> 5843.599999999999
put out good stuff like he's

5841.6 --> 5846.320000000001
had some dubious arguments here and

5843.6 --> 5848.639
there but he's also corrected things

5846.32 --> 5851.199
he's improving so i don't really see

5848.639 --> 5854.0
the control there right a real

5851.199 --> 5856.4
gatekeeper controlled opposition

5854.0 --> 5857.84
is gonna ensure that everything stays

5856.4 --> 5860.879999999999
exactly

5857.84 --> 5862.8
the same way including the way of

5860.88 --> 5864.8
thinking right

5862.8 --> 5865.84
there's another individual out there on

5864.8 --> 5869.84
the scene

5865.84 --> 5869.84
that conforms by exactly that

5873.28 --> 5885.04
but eric debay i don't see it

5881.92 --> 5887.36
[Music]

5885.04 --> 5889.5199999999995
huh hi thank you steven traveler i

5887.36 --> 5892.799999999999
appreciate that

5889.52 --> 5892.8
boring and repetitive

5894.48 --> 5900.4
maybe i've always tried to avoid

5898.08 --> 5901.28
just becoming somebody that's going to

5900.4 --> 5905.36
churn out

5901.28 --> 5907.119
my narrative over and over again

5905.36 --> 5909.759999999999
left it to moments where people

5907.119 --> 5912.239
genuinely wanted to ask about it

5909.76 --> 5913.6
and then i quickly on the spot explain

5912.239 --> 5915.599999999999
it

5913.6 --> 5917.119000000001
but they don't do like themed shows

5915.6 --> 5918.719
we're like okay now this

5917.119 --> 5921.119
weird day we're gonna talk about the

5918.719 --> 5922.8
rectangular looping again for two hours

5921.119 --> 5926.639
non-stop

5922.8 --> 5930.639
right i i don't do like full dedications

5926.639 --> 5930.639
i leave it raw i leave it to the moment

5931.04 --> 5934.56
then again i have a an everyday live

5933.52 --> 5937.6
show i don't think

5934.56 --> 5939.84
derrick dube has an everyday live show

5937.6 --> 5939.84
right

5941.04 --> 5944.4
only nathan oakley is really the only

5943.679 --> 5946.8
other guy

5944.4 --> 5953.679
that really has a live show every day

5946.8 --> 5957.04
most of mostly every day

5953.679 --> 5957.679
the rest is all just more about video

5957.04 --> 5967.84
editing

5957.679 --> 5967.84
and doing interviews

5988.8 --> 5992.8
or dube was the original guy well yeah

5991.84 --> 5996.400000000001
good servant

5992.8 --> 5997.119000000001
this is how i know i think eric dubay

5996.4 --> 6000.239
had a

5997.119 --> 6003.119
flat earth book very early

6000.239 --> 6004.5599999999995
because i remember the guy that i got

6003.119 --> 6009.759999999999
into flat earth with

6004.56 --> 6012.8
around 2010

6009.76 --> 6013.1990000000005
he had the book showed it to me and was

6012.8 --> 6016.4800000000005
even

6013.199 --> 6019.678999999999
selling it from his bookstore

6016.48 --> 6021.759999999999
eric to bay's freaking book it like it

6019.679 --> 6022.0
must be eric to base i don't know when

6021.76 --> 6026.96
he

6022.0 --> 6026.96
published it but yeah he had it

6027.679 --> 6030.639
i remember that

6030.96 --> 6038.639
and then yeah he got approached

6035.52 --> 6039.4400000000005
by some weirdo freemason or a jew or

6038.639 --> 6043.36
something

6039.44 --> 6045.04
old man with a bunch of badges

6043.36 --> 6046.799999999999
and then he was threatened like yeah you

6045.04 --> 6050.0
got to stop doing this

6046.8 --> 6051.92
don't no more flat earth or like we're

6050.0 --> 6053.6
gonna take away your kid

6051.92 --> 6056.159
something like that because he just had

6053.6 --> 6056.8
a newborn and after that point he

6056.159 --> 6061.28
stopped it

6056.8 --> 6061.28
he stopped talking about flat earth

6062.84 --> 6067.119000000001
everything

6064.08 --> 6067.119
but yeah his book

6074.52 --> 6079.84
plagiarism of powerlands lectures

6080.159 --> 6084.239
really how

6085.44 --> 6089.119
did he literally talk about math

6088.239 --> 6092.239
powerland

6089.119 --> 6093.92
in his book i haven't read the book i

6092.239 --> 6095.919999999999
don't even know if it's very good

6093.92 --> 6098.96
i just know it existed back then and i

6095.92 --> 6098.96
was boggled by it

6099.96 --> 6102.96
2014

6104.84 --> 6107.84
what

6109.84 --> 6121.84
that it was in no it was 2010

6140.32 --> 6144.239
okay what george sanford that's another

6146.84 --> 6149.84
book

6150.239 --> 6155.839999999999
god wait

6153.44 --> 6158.4
maybe it was math parliament did math

6155.84 --> 6161.6
powerland have a book

6158.4 --> 6165.36
because maybe it was his book then

6161.6 --> 6169.119000000001
because it was there in 2010

6165.36 --> 6172.48
not 2014 2010

6169.119 --> 6176.96
10 10 10 10 not 14

6172.48 --> 6180.239
2010 book flat earth word flat earth

6176.96 --> 6181.119
it had like water going over an edge out

6180.239 --> 6186.5599999999995
at the picture

6181.119 --> 6188.799999999999
it was a flat earth book in 2010

6186.56 --> 6191.4400000000005
i and i thought it was eric the base but

6188.8 --> 6192.08
maybe it was math powerlands or somebody

6191.44 --> 6195.04
else

6192.08 --> 6197.5199999999995
i don't know i don't remember i saw the

6195.04 --> 6197.5199999999995
book like

6202.84 --> 6205.84
once

6218.96 --> 6225.119
you can say nope 2014

6222.08 --> 6228.159
yeah that's a book i guess i saw a book

6225.119 --> 6230.719
in 2010. now i don't know if it was eric

6228.159 --> 6231.28
do base or math powerland or somebody

6230.719 --> 6234.639
else

6231.28 --> 6237.84
i just know it was flat earth absolutely

6234.639 --> 6238.08
literally very visible on the title and

6237.84 --> 6241.4400000000005
i

6238.08 --> 6245.119
also know it was 2010

6241.44 --> 6245.119
not 2014.

6245.52 --> 6261.84
all right this is a physical experience

6248.239 --> 6261.839999999999
physical book

6268.8 --> 6275.84
samuel robot them

6277.36 --> 6289.839999999999
well look

6281.679 --> 6289.84
if i i could recognize the cover

6299.76 --> 6303.84
wow wikipedia doesn't even show any

6314.84 --> 6322.159000000001
pictures

6316.48 --> 6322.159
synthetic astronomy no it's not that

6328.84 --> 6331.84
book

6359.04 --> 6363.679
okay interesting old house yeah i'm

6362.0 --> 6366.8
curious to know

6363.679 --> 6366.8
because look

6367.44 --> 6373.839999999999
i saw an eric debay video with his

6369.76 --> 6378.320000000001
freaking speech in 2012.

6373.84 --> 6382.8
and in 2010 i physically touched

6378.32 --> 6385.28
that book and i'm pretty sure it was his

6382.8 --> 6386.719
it's just that like what the [ __ ] is

6385.28 --> 6389.28
going on

6386.719 --> 6390.159
if that if that's not supposedly

6389.28 --> 6393.119
possible like

6390.159 --> 6401.839999999999
seriously what the [ __ ] is going on then

6393.119 --> 6401.839999999999
there's something really weird happening

6412.84 --> 6417.1990000000005
so

6414.48 --> 6419.678999999999
now seeing his video in 2012 i'm pretty

6417.199 --> 6421.5199999999995
sure that was a dark world vision

6419.679 --> 6424.159
because i saw some really other weird

6421.52 --> 6426.2390000000005
stuff like

6424.159 --> 6429.5199999999995
apparently some visualization of what

6426.239 --> 6432.159
would happen when

6429.52 --> 6434.159000000001
it was declassified that space was fake

6432.159 --> 6438.4
and the astronauts were actors

6434.159 --> 6441.44
like literally seeing that

6438.4 --> 6445.28
very prolonged

6441.44 --> 6448.638999999999
video reports and people responding

6445.28 --> 6452.48
on videos to

6448.639 --> 6454.56
hearing about it and then reflecting on

6452.48 --> 6455.5199999999995
how they are regarding science fiction

6454.56 --> 6458.639
after that but like

6455.52 --> 6462.2390000000005
so much that i see in that vision but it

6458.639 --> 6470.639
it remember clearly that i saw

6462.239 --> 6473.759999999999
that dubai video

6470.639 --> 6474.4800000000005
but yeah the book the book was physical

6473.76 --> 6477.52
that was

6474.48 --> 6480.159
physical i that was 100 not

6477.52 --> 6480.96
vision that was really in the physical

6480.159 --> 6485.839999999999
real world

6480.96 --> 6488.159
that really physically happened

6485.84 --> 6488.159000000001
i just

6491.199 --> 6496.32
i don't remember exactly i just know it

6494.48 --> 6498.799999999999
was a book it was flat earth it was on

6496.32 --> 6502.239
the title it had the picture

6498.8 --> 6505.28
like a boat falling over the edge

6502.239 --> 6507.5199999999995
water for some reason it that that was

6505.28 --> 6509.04
the picture

6507.52 --> 6511.52
and i thought it was written by eric

6509.04 --> 6513.44
dubay but it could be somebody else

6511.52 --> 6515.76
and it was not a book written by

6513.44 --> 6519.5199999999995
somebody like over 100 years old

6515.76 --> 6519.52
guaranteed it was fresh

6524.84 --> 6527.84
fresh

6540.0 --> 6546.639
right but anyway old horse get back on

6544.0 --> 6547.28
get back to me about that what you find

6546.639 --> 6550.2390000000005
out

6547.28 --> 6552.639
i want to figure out what happened right

6550.239 --> 6555.678999999999
a lot of [ __ ] in my life happened

6552.639 --> 6556.8
where afterward i'm like like decades

6555.679 --> 6559.679
later it's like

6556.8 --> 6559.679
what happened

6559.84 --> 6563.28
like for example i got that amazing big

6562.719 --> 6566.32
crystal

6563.28 --> 6568.719
remember but i've never

6566.32 --> 6569.36
managed to find back the store where i

6568.719 --> 6572.32
got it

6569.36 --> 6575.839999999999
so that's like this it's like i open up

6572.32 --> 6578.0
another dimension and then

6575.84 --> 6579.84
i walked into another dimension and then

6578.0 --> 6582.08
found like a magical store that you

6579.84 --> 6584.2390000000005
normally can't get into and bought this

6582.08 --> 6585.599
thing and i could never find the store

6584.239 --> 6587.678999999999
back

6585.599 --> 6589.84
like this sort of [ __ ] happens to me

6587.679 --> 6591.1990000000005
sometimes or it has happened i don't

6589.84 --> 6593.92
know if it's still gonna happen

6591.199 --> 6593.919999999999
i don't think so

6594.719 --> 6600.0
yeah there's no flat earth to make today

6596.48 --> 6600.0
i think nathan has not

6600.8 --> 6603.76
opened up the panel

6605.92 --> 6611.84
he's still recovering

6614.239 --> 6624.718999999999
two thousand dude tiny wumble

6617.76 --> 6627.280000000001
shut the [ __ ]

6624.719 --> 6627.28
how's that

6631.199 --> 6639.839999999999
that can't be 2014

6634.32 --> 6639.84
it can't be

6646.96 --> 6651.119
that that's crazy

6651.679 --> 6654.96
because that what you described

6653.44 --> 6657.5599999999995
described right there yeah that's

6654.96 --> 6660.2390000000005
exactly what it looked like but it was

6657.56 --> 6663.4400000000005
2010

6660.239 --> 6669.5199999999995
or 11 or something somewhere there

6663.44 --> 6669.5199999999995
is it's like before i even met my ex

6669.76 --> 6681.84
just doesn't make any sense

6684.4 --> 6688.5599999999995
could have made it um that's a good

6687.76 --> 6691.84
point

6688.56 --> 6695.84
yeah he might have like held back

6691.84 --> 6695.84
the release of it and that this guy

6695.92 --> 6698.96
had like an early release i think it

6698.08 --> 6701.36
could be that

6698.96 --> 6702.8
that would make more sense but yeah was

6701.36 --> 6706.639
it available

6702.8 --> 6709.04
it could have people taken

6706.639 --> 6710.88
it before it was officially published

6709.04 --> 6714.159
even like

6710.88 --> 6717.52
yeah i know it's a mystery to me

6714.159 --> 6717.5199999999995
but you have a good point there jerry

6720.84 --> 6723.84
sanford

6733.119 --> 6737.92
right yeah but old house i don't even

6736.639 --> 6741.4400000000005
know why we would

6737.92 --> 6741.4400000000005
refer to powerland

6745.28 --> 6750.88
i mean the guy is kind of an artist

6748.4 --> 6752.5599999999995
he's a bit of a blabber he's a bit of an

6750.88 --> 6755.1990000000005
action

6752.56 --> 6757.280000000001
he's an action painting guy and all that

6755.199 --> 6757.759999999999
so he was like kind of an artsy hipster

6757.28 --> 6761.679
but

6757.76 --> 6764.320000000001
like on the long run yeah he helped

6761.679 --> 6765.599
a lot with like the switch moment of

6764.32 --> 6769.28
realization it

6765.599 --> 6772.8
like oh [ __ ] he kind of assisted

6769.28 --> 6776.08
in that mindset at the time but

6772.8 --> 6777.679
what about recently right

6776.08 --> 6780.32
it's kind of the rest of the world has

6777.679 --> 6780.32
moved on

6782.639 --> 6787.679
right so yeah indeed started to research

6785.199 --> 6787.678999999999
he might

6787.76 --> 6792.96
he might have like been one of the first

6790.4 --> 6795.119
people to really spark up the engine but

6792.96 --> 6797.84
the engines running

6795.119 --> 6797.839999999999
right so

6798.159 --> 6802.0
and the bay has just done a lot has had

6801.28 --> 6806.5599999999995
a

6802.0 --> 6810.639
just a big body of work

6806.56 --> 6810.639
yes i know his name is matthew boylan

6811.719 --> 6814.719
2012.

6818.84 --> 6821.84
did

6836.48 --> 6849.839999999999
right dominoid exactly

6874.84 --> 6877.84
hmm

6884.4 --> 6891.839999999999
2012 spirit was definitely not called

6888.8 --> 6891.84
spiritual science

6893.679 --> 6901.36
what that's crazy

6897.92 --> 6904.639
like how the hell did

6901.36 --> 6909.679
my friend get that book did somebody

6904.639 --> 6909.679
like grab it from the future

6910.719 --> 6914.32
through connections or something

6914.639 --> 6918.08
tapped into the system like how is that

6917.199 --> 6922.4
possible

6918.08 --> 6922.4
because i am going to be very adamant

6922.88 --> 6928.96
the book was there i had it in my hand i

6925.76 --> 6928.96
know what it looked like

6929.199 --> 6932.96
how can it only have been published in

6931.239 --> 6938.48
2014 when i

6932.96 --> 6938.4800000000005
literally held it in my hand in 2011

6944.84 --> 6947.84
11.

6952.159 --> 6964.719
how's that even possible

6960.08 --> 6968.239
now this how is that mandela affected no

6964.719 --> 6970.0
mandela is not like yeah i had this book

6968.239 --> 6971.678999999999
wait i couldn't have had this book

6970.0 --> 6973.92
because it wasn't published yet no

6971.679 --> 6976.4
that's not mandela effect that just

6973.92 --> 6978.56
doesn't make any freaking sense

6976.4 --> 6980.638999999999
that's like temporal displacement that's

6978.56 --> 6982.4800000000005
not mandela effect mandela effect are

6980.639 --> 6989.84
slight alterations

6982.48 --> 6989.839999999999
it's not temporal displacement

6993.36 --> 6998.799999999999
flying books hairy hobbit

7000.84 --> 7003.84
what

7006.639 --> 7014.2390000000005
yes what

7011.92 --> 7014.2390000000005
yes

7015.199 --> 7021.44
what the [ __ ] yes palm cow yes

7018.32 --> 7023.5199999999995
that makes sense then so he got it

7021.44 --> 7027.919999999999
through amazon us

7023.52 --> 7027.92
they had like a weird early release

7028.8 --> 7035.119000000001
so it was public publicated

7032.0 --> 7037.36
2040 but it was already released in 2009

7035.119 --> 7040.48
now it makes perfect sense

7037.36 --> 7042.719
yes thank god not it's not

7040.48 --> 7045.04
weird time displacement that's always

7042.719 --> 7048.56
creepy when that [ __ ] happens

7045.04 --> 7050.719
if it can happen when you think it might

7048.56 --> 7058.080000000001
be happening it's freaky

7050.719 --> 7061.36
but okay that makes sense

7058.08 --> 7065.28
yeah tiny wumbo but pam cowell

7061.36 --> 7065.28
just revealed something interesting

7065.36 --> 7072.88
so amazon apparently had like an early

7067.84 --> 7075.1990000000005
crabblers release

7072.88 --> 7077.52
they released it even earlier than it

7075.199 --> 7080.5599999999995
was released

7077.52 --> 7082.159000000001
i wonder now if it the publication date

7080.56 --> 7085.679
because the book has a public

7082.159 --> 7087.44
if it would have said 2014 then

7085.679 --> 7089.28
because if i knew back then that would

7087.44 --> 7090.96
have even freaked me out like what how

7089.28 --> 7093.5199999999995
is this possible

7090.96 --> 7097.44
it says 2014 how can you have it how can

7093.52 --> 7097.4400000000005
i have it in my hand in 2011.

7098.84 --> 7101.84
weird

7108.48 --> 7129.678999999999
harry hubbard i

7112.84 --> 7132.32
okay never heard of him

7129.679 --> 7133.679
oh right guns well i never said it was a

7132.32 --> 7136.4
good book

7133.679 --> 7138.32
i just remember that i had it in my

7136.4 --> 7140.0
hands

7138.32 --> 7143.44
and that i was really shocked about it

7140.0 --> 7146.88
that it existed

7143.44 --> 7146.879999999999
i never actually read it

7148.8 --> 7155.04
i think that even the guy who had it

7153.119 --> 7156.799999999999
he even said like yeah there's a lot of

7155.04 --> 7159.679
[ __ ] in there

7156.8 --> 7161.360000000001
to me i never read it i just remember

7159.679 --> 7164.4800000000005
that i had it in my hands

7161.36 --> 7164.48
in 2011.

7164.719 --> 7168.639
yes tiny womble we read you the first

7168.0 --> 7173.119
time

7168.639 --> 7176.56
tiny womble yes we know

7173.119 --> 7180.32
now scroll back and look

7176.56 --> 7180.320000000001
at what pam cowell said

7180.639 --> 7191.52

7185.52 --> 7191.52

7192.32 --> 7198.799999999999

make earth flat again or free again

and you can interchange earth for europe

7550.239 --> 7562.0
as well if you want

7552.48 --> 7565.119
so mifa can mean all kinds of things

7562.0 --> 7568.639
was an original play on

7565.119 --> 7573.839999999999
words and spirit with the maga

7568.639 --> 7577.84
right that meme that went around

7573.84 --> 7577.84
