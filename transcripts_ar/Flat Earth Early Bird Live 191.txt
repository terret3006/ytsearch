6.75 --> 38.04
[Music]

39.17 --> 46.86
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.08 --> 49.89
early-bird number 191 I'm your host

46.86 --> 51.69
Arwen and please before we start the

49.89 --> 55.29
show don't forget to share it on any

51.69 --> 56.73
platform you deem fit and also if you

55.29 --> 58.53
haven't already subscribed to my channel

56.73 --> 59.879
and hit the bell notification so you

58.53 --> 62.28
know when I'm going live which is

59.879 --> 68.759
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

62.28 --> 73.77
day and yeah welcome today the weather

68.759 --> 76.59
is better it's very nice and warm again

73.77 --> 82.05
still bit cloudy every now and then

76.59 --> 86.10000000000001
what's just nice and warm a bit of a

82.05 --> 95.789
fresh breeze sometimes it's just it's

86.1 --> 102.38999999999999
nice and today I got 2/3 of a iluminati

95.789 --> 107.88
Kisan some tea of course and to Mara

102.39 --> 110.64
coffee prepared it another way or I keep

107.88 --> 112.47
on trying figuring out what's the right

110.64 --> 114.119
way to do it and I was kind of late

112.47 --> 119.13
today sorry everyone

114.119 --> 122.369
because yeah I literally at 2 o'clock I

119.13 --> 125.61
was like oh I forgot my coffee and it

122.369 --> 127.41
takes a damn long time to get through

125.61 --> 131.94
that thing the way that I do it so I

127.41 --> 135.44
think I'm gonna try another setup maybe

131.94 --> 139.38
put regular coffee underneath and the

135.44 --> 144.39
and the tumeric pepper mix with coffee

139.38 --> 148.2
mixed up on top so then maybe the Kepler

144.39 --> 153.95899999999997
force of the regular coffee will kind of

148.2 --> 157.01999999999998
pull down the yeah the liquids that are

153.959 --> 159.93
not going through the coffee with the

157.02 --> 161.90900000000002
tumeric mix all too well maybe they will

159.93 --> 163.709
pull it down and so it will hasten the

161.909 --> 166.92
process I'm gonna try that next time

163.709 --> 169.079
so but at least cheers everyone I'm

166.92 --> 176.14999999999998
gonna enjoy this because I really like

169.079 --> 181.15900000000002
this new habit hmm whoa holy [ __ ]

176.15 --> 184.739
okay right I can taste the pepper now

181.159 --> 189.269
yeah I I actually didn't use my pepper

184.739 --> 193.29
grinder this time I bought a box of them

189.269 --> 196.29
of pepper dust and I literally mix it in

193.29 --> 198.81
with the entire tumeric thing like

196.29 --> 203.04
blended it in and then use that so it's

198.81 --> 212.849
more pepper and whoa it it's a little

203.04 --> 215.12
spicy now didn't expect that Cheers it's

212.849 --> 215.11999999999998
weird

218.76 --> 226.85999999999999
it kind of reminds me of certain type of

223.83 --> 228.81
wine I like to drink I like to drink a

226.86 --> 233.39000000000001
way back when I wasn't so strictly

228.81 --> 237.599
organic yet it was honey wine Mead with

233.39 --> 240.08999999999997
red pepper in it and that was kind of

237.599 --> 241.76899999999998
the same experience it's like hot on the

240.09 --> 244.379
surface the peppery thing is like it

241.769 --> 246.829
hits you but then kind of draws away

244.379 --> 250.64999999999998
it's not that bad

246.829 --> 253.17000000000002
interesting and yet the tumeric effects

250.65 --> 257.959
and maybe even the caffeine combined

253.17 --> 261.269
with the pepper it's bouncing and hands

257.959 --> 263.639
many of these effects I can really feel

261.269 --> 267.99
it like wow this just this sip of coffee

263.639 --> 273.36
hits me I'm not gonna drink this one all

267.99 --> 274.8
out now five artists lever a little oh

273.36 --> 279.139
yeah I made it myself

274.8 --> 281.94
I buy my coffee at Simon and lay felt

279.139 --> 282.69
which has very good organic coffees

281.94 --> 285.12
these days

282.69 --> 291.51
really appreciate that they do and I get

285.12 --> 295.55
the Mexican coffee and then I took yeah

291.51 --> 300.63
tumeric powder and black pepper powder

295.55 --> 303.72
from the organic store got brands mixed

300.63 --> 307.53
it in just totally made one thing out of

303.72 --> 309.57000000000005
it and then I use the coffee and I mix

307.53 --> 312.75
it in with that coffee in the coffee

309.57 --> 315.0
machine and it's a new experience and

312.75 --> 318.78
it's so different

315.0 --> 319.59
because I used to drink coffee and like

318.78 --> 321.9
every time I do

319.59 --> 327.479
it's like hits my stomach pretty badly

321.9 --> 329.21999999999997
like afterward I have to like like get

327.479 --> 330.96
over that or something I don't know it

329.22 --> 332.16
would hit me back but since I'm using

330.96 --> 335.14
tumeric in it

332.16 --> 337.87
even without the pepper

335.14 --> 339.90999999999997
that doesn't happen anymore it's a

337.87 --> 347.79
totally new way of drinking coffee for

339.91 --> 347.79
me so yeah I like it

348.68 --> 357.11
Wow man [ __ ] to be careful next time not

353.93 --> 365.75
to scoop too much into it because it is

357.11 --> 374.63
so hot now anyway thanks take some tea

365.75 --> 381.639
to put out the fire whoo man that's some

374.63 --> 381.639
spicy coffee right Cheers

413.41 --> 421.51000000000005
right so let's see was in chat yeah I

418.01 --> 425.98
level at a long discussion earlier a

421.51 --> 427.73
Steve rent em and sleeping warrior

425.98 --> 433.61
thanks for visiting

427.73 --> 436.33000000000004
uber Mukul glass Shah righteous force or

433.61 --> 436.33000000000004
at the circus

439.37 --> 444.29
yeah he's asking about crow triple7

442.28 --> 445.78999999999996
sorry I don't really meticulously follow

444.29 --> 446.8
him I have no idea what you're talking

445.79 --> 451.03000000000003
about

446.8 --> 454.3
then of course five artists limber Alice

451.03 --> 454.29999999999995
chocolates saying

458.74 --> 464.46000000000004
David read level Li

469.14 --> 473.26
yeah

470.66 --> 473.26000000000005
yeah

479.29 --> 488.17
I think something went wrong when I

481.54 --> 490.63
tried to swallow that last bite I think

488.17 --> 492.96000000000004
something may have slipped in the wrong

490.63 --> 492.96
place

501.54 --> 505.25
or maybe it's just the pepper

510.26 --> 516.27
yeahi games are from finished yeah I

513.06 --> 518.5799999999999
haven't seen it but I've heard too many

516.27 --> 521.01
spoilers about already it's pretty much

518.58 --> 523.4300000000001
exactly what was going to be yeah and

521.01 --> 528.6
what I expected it's always the worst

523.43 --> 533.88
and I'm still playing the game in the

528.6 --> 539.57
online game we which is kind of amusing

533.88 --> 539.57
and basic and I'm still a banker there

540.77 --> 546.48
but yeah i'll i am gonna definitely

543.75 --> 551.279
continue watching it i enjoyed that last

546.48 --> 555.54
season before this one a lot it was very

551.279 --> 558.57
inspiring and yeah i can't wait to see

555.54 --> 564.81
it continue and I pretty much get Game

558.57 --> 566.3100000000001
of Thrones now so yeah I can't wait to

564.81 --> 568.41
see it but it's gonna take a while so I

566.31 --> 572.6099999999999
either have to like download if that's

568.41 --> 575.64
even possible to find anything or wait

572.61 --> 578.3100000000001
until I don't know it becomes available

575.64 --> 580.23
to Netflix or something I don't know

578.31 --> 583.8199999999999
maybe that's gonna happen you know with

580.23 --> 586.2
Netflix the way their what they're doing

583.82 --> 589.6800000000001
there's a chance that they're like going

586.2 --> 595.62
to just buy buy the rights to everything

589.68 --> 597.87
and become like the Universal series and

595.62 --> 599.55
movies network that they're gonna try it

597.87 --> 600.93
at least then there's probably others as

599.55 --> 602.79
well those are just gonna like try to

600.93 --> 606.54
take on everything so maybe it will

602.79 --> 608.3
eventually just all funnel together like

606.54 --> 611.4
that that would be kind of interesting

608.3 --> 613.2299999999999
and ominous of course because they had

611.4 --> 616.74
the more centralized control becomes

613.23 --> 619.1
with the more crazy that controllers get

616.74 --> 619.1
so

628.65 --> 634.17
[Music]

630.949 --> 636.42
the hope well they try it there's

634.17 --> 638.819
certainly elements more complex

636.42 --> 640.1289999999999
political elements to the game Game of

638.819 --> 644.189
Thrones

640.129 --> 647.129
so there's definitely parallels but it

644.189 --> 649.4699999999999
is kind of idealized from an elitist

647.129 --> 656.4590000000001
perspective you have to take that into

649.47 --> 662.119
account like even back then something

656.459 --> 662.1189999999999
like this didn't really last for long so

662.779 --> 668.48
evil doesn't last for long

665.339 --> 668.48
that's the thing about it

676.99 --> 679.99
yeah

688.49 --> 694.91
oh right yeah five artists Lieber Alice

691.7 --> 697.5500000000001
yeah that's a a basic composite bow

694.91 --> 700.42
that's hanging behind me since the start

697.55 --> 700.42
of the show pretty much

709.42 --> 714.61
so yeah I had some subjects to talk

712.27 --> 716.17
about but I'm getting myself distracted

714.61 --> 726.01
from being late and everything in this

716.17 --> 727.7199999999999
weird peppery tumeric coffee hmm okay

726.01 --> 732.39
when it's not so hot it's even it's

727.72 --> 732.39
better I might actually get me out there

738.63 --> 748.17
Oh oh my god that's spicy

743.269 --> 757.5600000000001
hooey okay I hope my stomach is gonna

748.17 --> 761.1899999999999
take that I do eat like like organic red

757.56 --> 765.54
pepper fresh almost every day so I am

761.19 --> 769.86
kinda used to pepper and I have

765.54 --> 777.06
Indonesian genetics somewhat so that

769.86 --> 780.9590000000001
also helps no no chocolate I didn't

777.06 --> 784.5189999999999
watch that your juicer crap show hey

780.959 --> 784.5189999999999
would you like to come on my panel

794.13 --> 802.84
yeah fired up indeed and the heat is

798.88 --> 814.24
starting to radiates I'm going super

802.84 --> 816.6700000000001
saiyan right um okay the subjects it was

814.24 --> 822.72
kind of funny I was on the debate

816.67 --> 825.25
yesterday and had a was very active and

822.72 --> 829.24
Nathan was very the thought I was very

825.25 --> 831.22
interruptive and I didn't care but yeah

829.24 --> 834.16
there were some funny subjects that I

831.22 --> 837.76
would want to reflect back on for

834.16 --> 840.27
example my theory of gas pressure

837.76 --> 842.47
without a container and how the

840.27 --> 845.53
atmospheres would be held together on

842.47 --> 850.1800000000001
planets that had atmospheres thanks to

845.53 --> 853.66
unicorn farts so I thought it was kind

850.18 --> 856.8399999999999
of funny it's what Nathan keeps on using

853.66 --> 858.4599999999999
as a theory to ridicule things to fat to

856.84 --> 860.89
emphasize the fantasy but I actually

858.46 --> 862.84
took it seriously and just said like

860.89 --> 866.4399999999999
okay what if there are unicorns

862.84 --> 868.8100000000001
there were unicorns once during creation

866.44 --> 871.74
you know this you yet my universe

868.81 --> 874.0
conceptualization could still be a

871.74 --> 875.95
creation I don't care about that at all

874.0 --> 879.55
I'm just saying like no it's just Globes

875.95 --> 881.1700000000001
and into a wide thing and gravity sure

879.55 --> 884.62
gravity but yeah that gravity is not

881.17 --> 887.74
gonna keep the gas on the on the surface

884.62 --> 889.57
of the planet you know it would still go

887.74 --> 891.4300000000001
out so if there has to be a vacuum then

889.57 --> 894.0400000000001
there must be unicorn farts and those

891.43 --> 897.55
uniform farts how they would basically

894.04 --> 898.75
do it is the unicorns were once there at

897.55 --> 901.4799999999999
the beginning of life they were

898.75 --> 903.28
basically waking over the puddle in

901.48 --> 905.44
which the rest of life was springing

903.28 --> 908.62
forth or maybe it took a piss and life

905.44 --> 910.87
came out of it I don't know something

908.62 --> 913.0
like that and yeah the unicorns farted

910.87 --> 915.58
and though the unicorns eventually died

913.0 --> 919.96
from old age the farts were unique

915.58 --> 925.1500000000001
material and they were like a gas that

919.96 --> 927.45
has a very low density but like a liquid

925.15 --> 930.37
would have very strong surface tension

927.45 --> 932.7700000000001
very unusual type of gas and it's

930.37 --> 934.63
transparent so you can't really see so

932.77 --> 938.41
all this unicorn fart would then

934.63 --> 941.2
eventually build up in a layer above the

938.41 --> 943.5699999999999
rest of the gas but it would not

941.2 --> 946.0
disperse in space because the surface

943.57 --> 948.5500000000001
tension would enable it to stretch

946.0 --> 951.13
beyond a certain point artificially

948.55 --> 954.4
creating a bubble holding in the rest of

951.13 --> 956.4399999999999
the gas pressure so there you go

954.4 --> 959.35
that's how it works and that's also how

956.44 --> 962.32
you can enable it to basically penetrate

959.35 --> 964.5400000000001
that with the device and then yeah at a

962.32 --> 967.5100000000001
short point it's like bursting a bubble

964.54 --> 971.62
and other gas would try to escape out

967.51 --> 975.1899999999999
but eventually the unicorn farts will

971.62 --> 977.35
like gloop back together so there might

975.19 --> 979.2900000000001
escape some air every time the ship

977.35 --> 983.08
tries to penetrate the outer layer but

979.29 --> 986.98
anyway so there's my theory on a possum

983.08 --> 989.08
potential for an outer space vacuum with

986.98 --> 993.4300000000001
gas pressure on a ball earth with

989.08 --> 996.3100000000001
gravity yeah it's actually serious how

993.43 --> 998.5899999999999
hilarious is that but it would require a

996.31 --> 1000.5999999999999
substance of this very specific nature

998.59 --> 1002.82
that's basically it yeah and I

1000.6 --> 1007.0500000000001
conceptualize it as unicorn farts for

1002.82 --> 1009.5400000000001
the fun of it but who knows potentially

1007.05 --> 1011.49
cause that to come into existence maybe

1009.54 --> 1012.3299999999999
it was an original material it just

1011.49 --> 1016.32
happened

1012.33 --> 1019.35
bla bla bla bla bla anyway then there is

1016.32 --> 1021.48
another of much more extensive theory

1019.35 --> 1024.51
that I also presented very shortly

1021.48 --> 1028.8
because I absolutely expected Nathan to

1024.51 --> 1032.31
just totally laughs me laugh me away and

1028.8 --> 1036.1699999999998
says it is all [ __ ] because yeah it

1032.31 --> 1039.69
is different but I conceptualize

1036.17 --> 1044.76
conceptualize a universe with planets

1039.69 --> 1049.65
and Suns and not in vacuum but in a

1044.76 --> 1052.44
relatively lower gas outer universe that

1049.65 --> 1054.1200000000001
would be everywhere the gas and the

1052.44 --> 1056.1000000000001
planets would be held together by the

1054.12 --> 1058.5
gravity gradually

1056.1 --> 1060.1799999999998
and there would be slightly thicker gas

1058.5 --> 1062.46
pressure on the planets because of that

1060.18 --> 1064.41
and yeah pretty much every planet will

1062.46 --> 1066.78
have to have some kind of gas on it

1064.41 --> 1071.93
because there is gas everywhere and if

1066.78 --> 1074.6399999999999
gravity will hold that matter together

1071.93 --> 1077.3400000000001
then there's bound to get some thicker

1074.64 --> 1080.76
gas pressure on every planet unless it

1077.34 --> 1083.07
is just a weird gas planet which we have

1080.76 --> 1085.62
to be very dense gas that just just be

1083.07 --> 1087.9299999999998
goes beyond the threshold and is enables

1085.62 --> 1090.4499999999998
gravity to basically grasp it together

1087.93 --> 1093.66
somehow right so and how all these

1090.45 --> 1095.73
planets would then motion and and the

1093.66 --> 1099.42
Sun in the universe how that will work

1095.73 --> 1102.18
is yeah the friction supposedly would

1099.42 --> 1104.67
stop the orbits well not if everything

1102.18 --> 1108.3300000000002
is basically set on a magnetic rail of

1104.67 --> 1110.28
orbits and that good ties into an

1108.33 --> 1112.6499999999999
extrapolation on the electric universe

1110.28 --> 1114.99
the original electric universe concept

1112.65 --> 1120.6000000000001
would be an electric universe in a

1114.99 --> 1123.54
gaseous space concept and there would be

1120.6 --> 1127.7099999999998
magnetic reels causing the fixed orbits

1123.54 --> 1129.57
and it would not be a falling gravity it

1127.71 --> 1132.29
would literally just be in orbit real

1129.57 --> 1135.6599999999999
and it would explain much better how

1132.29 --> 1138.06
planets and things don't go out of orbit

1135.66 --> 1140.49
it might then be conceptualized that

1138.06 --> 1144.78
they could be like pushed out of it like

1140.49 --> 1148.05
a ball being pushed or pulled outside of

1144.78 --> 1153.21
a magnetic grip maybe that could happen

1148.05 --> 1156.96
and planets could - silly be dislocated

1153.21 --> 1162.3500000000001
from their orbit now there is a new

1156.96 --> 1166.65
foundation for an outer space cosmos and

1162.35 --> 1169.55
yeah I could extrapolate on this it's

1166.65 --> 1176.0600000000002
all presuppositional of course but it

1169.55 --> 1180.3799999999999
fixes some physics issues and why not

1176.06 --> 1185.03
it's actually much more potent much more

1180.38 --> 1185.0300000000002
interesting and explorable

1195.4 --> 1199.7
yeah and it wouldn't that

1197.45 --> 1202.79
conceptualisation by the way would not

1199.7 --> 1206.03
require unicorn farts to exist just for

1202.79 --> 1212.24
the record so it's actually a little bit

1206.03 --> 1227.02
more serious sort of now I think it is

1212.24 --> 1227.02
an interesting model so that was that

1229.72 --> 1236.89
let's see yeah I had a good talk with my

1232.46 --> 1236.89
dad right before the show very extensive

1238.54 --> 1245.24
about learning about how the frequencies

1242.45 --> 1248.8600000000001
work like really the way I talked with

1245.24 --> 1254.21
Jessica a lot I also referenced that and

1248.86 --> 1256.3999999999999
I have had very extensive interesting

1254.21 --> 1258.71
spiritual experiences not like whew

1256.4 --> 1261.23
something hallucinatory something like

1258.71 --> 1263.45
really shocking nothing like that but

1261.23 --> 1267.429
just I'm seem to be very in tune with

1263.45 --> 1270.92
this this system I'm figuring out with

1267.429 --> 1274.3700000000001
with pure energy and subconscious I'm

1270.92 --> 1278.72
really getting it structured much better

1274.37 --> 1281.36
and I'm almost kind of bit nervous about

1278.72 --> 1283.78
it because I think I'm one of the few

1281.36 --> 1287.1399999999999
people that can actually do it like that

1283.78 --> 1290.12
very few people are talented enough

1287.14 --> 1291.13
while talent is it a talent it's a

1290.12 --> 1293.75
talent for that

1291.13 --> 1295.88
but doesn't necessarily apply to

1293.75 --> 1304.88
everything else oh yeah I can I

1295.88 --> 1308.67
definitely do use it but losing track

1304.88 --> 1313.8000000000002
it is just a talent to really sense

1308.67 --> 1316.8600000000001
things by spiritual and utilizing the

1313.8 --> 1318.48
subconscious like training it much more

1316.86 --> 1321.6299999999999
extensively like you would train a

1318.48 --> 1324.24
soldier like everybody knows basic

1321.63 --> 1325.8600000000001
defense reflexes and [ __ ] but it's

1324.24 --> 1328.35
always going to be basic but when you

1325.86 --> 1331.8899999999999
really train certain elements to them

1328.35 --> 1335.61
like actively take control of it deal

1331.89 --> 1340.5800000000002
with the mechanism then you can make it

1335.61 --> 1344.34
better do more with it even get your

1340.58 --> 1348.4199999999998
visualization mechanism involved so

1344.34 --> 1352.07
there is like a separate feedback your

1348.42 --> 1356.22
visualization like synchronizes with

1352.07 --> 1358.55
with sensing and thinking about things

1356.22 --> 1361.32
and figuring out the frequency it aids

1358.55 --> 1363.27
when I do that it's it's very

1361.32 --> 1371.31
interesting process how it really works

1363.27 --> 1375.66
psychologically I guess yeah but my dad

1371.31 --> 1380.94
we talked about like the spiritual

1375.66 --> 1384.48
revolution and in the forties through

1380.94 --> 1385.68
Rudolf Steiner definitely and also

1384.48 --> 1388.59
through somebody else

1385.68 --> 1391.1100000000001
my dad reminded me about who is right

1388.59 --> 1395.25
after his age and that's guy called

1391.11 --> 1398.49
viktor schauberger who was a little

1395.25 --> 1401.37
younger than Rudolf Steiner but they

1398.49 --> 1408.81
were friends and this guy was kind of

1401.37 --> 1410.9699999999998
like a bit of a hermit and like a ranger

1408.81 --> 1416.4299999999998
type that would always be in forests and

1410.97 --> 1419.19
[ __ ] but he also like became a very

1416.43 --> 1422.1000000000001
fascinating Electrical inventor he

1419.19 --> 1425.94
really figured out magnetics almost like

1422.1 --> 1428.6399999999999
Tesla but did his own basic things with

1425.94 --> 1432.8
it and figured out some fascinating

1428.64 --> 1435.21
applications that I've almost forgotten

1432.8 --> 1437.34
but I've dealt with it before but it

1435.21 --> 1438.45
just it's so subtle in nature his

1437.34 --> 1440.37
solutions that you

1438.45 --> 1444.05
just forget about it it's like so subtle

1440.37 --> 1447.4499999999998
for example what he suggests is that

1444.05 --> 1449.97
this is for he started to focus on

1447.45 --> 1453.21
gardening a lot because he also dealt in

1449.97 --> 1455.28
like hydro engines and even levitation

1453.21 --> 1457.71
devices and [ __ ] like he was told

1455.28 --> 1459.66
inventor but it was discouraged

1457.71 --> 1462.39
eventually to do that and then he went

1459.66 --> 1465.27
into farming and trying to apply it to

1462.39 --> 1467.7800000000002
that and he did it and one of the things

1465.27 --> 1470.79
he figured out basically what he states

1467.78 --> 1473.3899999999999
my dad told me this I'm gonna try to

1470.79 --> 1475.8
find books and actually read up on it

1473.39 --> 1478.6100000000001
because it's that interesting but what

1475.8 --> 1483.27
he said is that when you plow the land

1478.61 --> 1486.57
when you're gonna dig through earth you

1483.27 --> 1491.28
know if you're gonna use steel tools to

1486.57 --> 1494.58
do that like Rick's or a shovel then the

1491.28 --> 1497.3999999999999
presence of that steel is gonna have

1494.58 --> 1501.21
like a weird magnetic side effect on the

1497.4 --> 1504.21
soil that's actually detrimental yeah

1501.21 --> 1506.58
it's like okay who would ever thought

1504.21 --> 1510.0
about that right so what he then figured

1506.58 --> 1512.58
out is if you have copper tools pure

1510.0 --> 1514.41
copper tools or something with mostly

1512.58 --> 1516.03
copper I suggested like why don't you

1514.41 --> 1518.22
mix in a little silver that might be

1516.03 --> 1520.53
interesting to you use copper tools to

1518.22 --> 1524.16
dig through earth so shuffles rakes that

1520.53 --> 1527.72
kind of thing then it actually has a

1524.16 --> 1531.69
beneficial effect and the soil becomes

1527.72 --> 1534.9
energetically more potent yeah like what

1531.69 --> 1536.55
and I have even seen like copper garden

1534.9 --> 1541.16
tools and never really thought about it

1536.55 --> 1545.04
like okay that's interesting but

1541.16 --> 1547.53
definitely worth trying so I I hope that

1545.04 --> 1550.47
somebody forwards this to Owen Benjamin

1547.53 --> 1555.3
because that would be maybe down his

1550.47 --> 1559.31
lane and if he doesn't like this guy

1555.3 --> 1559.31
then maybe his wife will

1560.29 --> 1567.26
if he likes a read up because it is it

1563.6 --> 1569.4199999999998
is very difficult it is more spiritually

1567.26 --> 1571.22
different and electrically oriented is

1569.42 --> 1576.0800000000002
just another way of approaching it all

1571.22 --> 1579.08
and it's fascinating so copper tools for

1576.08 --> 1581.33
gardening I'm gonna try to remember that

1579.08 --> 1584.6899999999998
if you use copper tools for gardening

1581.33 --> 1588.5
it's better for everything because of

1584.69 --> 1590.48
the weird electrochemical interaction

1588.5 --> 1594.11
you have to think of it like a nodes and

1590.48 --> 1595.88
Theo's and the ground is also like a

1594.11 --> 1598.55
conductor apparently so if you're gonna

1595.88 --> 1601.19
use steel it's gonna be almost like

1598.55 --> 1605.0
nickel there is sometimes even little

1601.19 --> 1607.31
nickel and steel right so but if you use

1605.0 --> 1609.86
copper then it will have the opposite

1607.31 --> 1611.0
effect apparently that's what he figured

1609.86 --> 1615.02
out it's amazing

1611.0 --> 1622.46
so trying to remember this let's see if

1615.02 --> 1627.29
you can apply it copper strips keeps the

1622.46 --> 1630.47
slugs of your veg well there you go

1627.29 --> 1632.35
another side effect but there's more to

1630.47 --> 1636.07
it it is like an electrochemical

1632.35 --> 1638.9299999999998
interaction magnetic field related and

1636.07 --> 1641.45
fascinating and I'm gonna read up on it

1638.93 --> 1644.54
this guy was a real amazing inventor

1641.45 --> 1648.95
wave he he pretty much started like the

1644.54 --> 1651.79
weird invention revolution in that time

1648.95 --> 1651.79
the early ones

1654.71 --> 1666.3890000000001
or a copper cups hmm that's interesting

1662.419 --> 1669.96
good work I if I get the juice then I

1666.389 --> 1674.519
would prefer a silver but okay I guess

1669.96 --> 1678.8990000000001
copper I use ceramics I've always used

1674.519 --> 1681.8700000000001
ceramics or of course glass and that's

1678.899 --> 1684.4499999999998
it I don't like porcelain for some

1681.87 --> 1684.9599999999998
reason and I especially don't like steel

1684.45 --> 1689.49
things

1684.96 --> 1693.6000000000001
I don't know why well maybe this is why

1689.49 --> 1694.879
maybe that's why I don't like it what a

1693.6 --> 1701.879
thought

1694.879 --> 1713.61
there you go another inventor viktor

1701.879 --> 1720.149
schauberger kind of his name a very

1713.61 --> 1722.36
German oh wait it's with the K let me do

1720.149 --> 1722.36
that again

1732.86 --> 1739.28
yeah you designed a UFO that's right and

1736.2 --> 1742.14
it crashed into the ceiling and then I

1739.28 --> 1746.16
think that wasn't an American then they

1742.14 --> 1748.71
said like yeah stop doing this this is

1746.16 --> 1753.0
not this is not what we want

1748.71 --> 1755.55
they it was too far like too soon and

1753.0 --> 1758.07
they probably ended up like stealing his

1755.55 --> 1759.51
work and he apparently my dad shared

1758.07 --> 1761.9099999999999
that apparently he used to be very

1759.51 --> 1764.87
afraid that his knowledge and insight

1761.91 --> 1768.15
was going to be abused with good reason

1764.87 --> 1770.6
because it probably has been through

1768.15 --> 1774.0
industry gradually like why our

1770.6 --> 1776.73
gardening tools still naturally why is

1774.0 --> 1778.35
that the standard for example and

1776.73 --> 1780.15
there's more of these types of

1778.35 --> 1782.9599999999998
application what once you start to

1780.15 --> 1787.65
realize the influence of types of metals

1782.96 --> 1790.16
with water and with soil and with

1787.65 --> 1790.16
yourself

1793.16 --> 1799.3200000000002
[Music]

1795.69 --> 1803.6100000000001
all right yeah

1799.32 --> 1807.12
so then we go into all that it is kind

1803.61 --> 1810.24
of related but I find it fascinating

1807.12 --> 1813.3
that he then started to use Applied

1810.24 --> 1815.76
Sciences his knowledge he's like the

1813.3 --> 1820.71
Tesla farmer that's what he became a

1815.76 --> 1825.69
Tesla farmer and fascinating it is very

1820.71 --> 1829.1100000000001
it's probably exquisite knowledge like

1825.69 --> 1831.3300000000002
very good knowledge that is just being

1829.11 --> 1833.1599999999999
overlooked and not really talked about

1831.33 --> 1836.1299999999999
so this is this could be kind of

1833.16 --> 1840.3200000000002
precious to really latch onto and make

1836.13 --> 1840.3200000000002
it our own I'm gonna try it

1843.5 --> 1848.85
unfortunately I don't have a garden but

1845.97 --> 1850.71
if I will get a garden I know I am gonna

1848.85 --> 1865.11
get copper tools all copper tools

1850.71 --> 1867.65
everything so yeah that was kind of

1865.11 --> 1871.5
interesting new revelation from my dad

1867.65 --> 1875.8500000000001
see we have the Flat Earth and our own

1871.5 --> 1883.62
unique sources we pick out and my dad's

1875.85 --> 1885.33
more on the spiritual healer circuit and

1883.62 --> 1887.82
it's like its own circuit it's like an

1885.33 --> 1889.98
alternative medical circuit very

1887.82 --> 1892.86
spiritually focused it's really a thing

1889.98 --> 1894.99
it's like a lot of people hundreds in

1892.86 --> 1897.24
the Netherlands alone and they're more

1894.99 --> 1899.79
out there and they have conventions and

1897.24 --> 1901.59
congresses and everything kind of like

1899.79 --> 1904.95
Flat Earth in their own way but it's

1901.59 --> 1907.1399999999999
more sporadic and they have their own

1904.95 --> 1911.73
issues against the media and everything

1907.14 --> 1915.21
then they yeah they have their own

1911.73 --> 1917.55
precious sources as they're figuring it

1915.21 --> 1920.7
out it is very similar to what Flat

1917.55 --> 1924.02
Earth movement has been doing but in an

1920.7 --> 1928.23
alternative medical way it is really

1924.02 --> 1931.01
beyond the regular alternative medical

1928.23 --> 1934.89
knowledge even that we know

1931.01 --> 1936.84
because I I like spices I like plants

1934.89 --> 1938.88
and applying medical knowledge from

1936.84 --> 1943.05
plants but what these people deal with

1938.88 --> 1945.66
is beyond that it kind of out does it at

1943.05 --> 1948.6
times like they can even figure out okay

1945.66 --> 1952.0800000000002
you take a certain medicine or an

1948.6 --> 1954.4499999999998
influence of any kind medical be it an

1952.08 --> 1958.1899999999998
herb or be the drug even they can

1954.45 --> 1960.99
basically then figure out the frequency

1958.19 --> 1962.7
using a machine figuring out the

1960.99 --> 1965.85
frequency of that substance you like

1962.7 --> 1966.63
scan it energetically it's magnetically

1965.85 --> 1969.57
I don't know

1966.63 --> 1972.39
and then they copy their frequency and

1969.57 --> 1975.51
they apply it to liquid and then that

1972.39 --> 1979.2
liquid if you submit to it if you don't

1975.51 --> 1982.77
if you allow the placebo effect

1979.2 --> 1985.14
basically it will absolutely noticeably

1982.77 --> 1988.53
cause the effects sometimes even

1985.14 --> 1990.15
prettier drastically of whatever the

1988.53 --> 1992.7
substance is you're trying to copy yeah

1990.15 --> 1999.17
that's another freaking technology is

1992.7 --> 2002.06
like copy pasting complex things but

1999.17 --> 2005.21
like an illusion almost but it's not an

2002.06 --> 2007.73
illusion it's just you copy the energy

2005.21 --> 2010.76
signature and not the literal material

2007.73 --> 2015.38
it's amazing to me and I've my dad's

2010.76 --> 2019.01
known this for I've been subject to that

2015.38 --> 2021.3200000000002
stuff because my dad has it like 15

2019.01 --> 2024.3799999999999
years ago even it wasn't it would

2021.32 --> 2027.11
noticeably work you could technically

2024.38 --> 2031.0100000000002
even battle symptoms pretty directly of

2027.11 --> 2033.7099999999998
a lot of things it's amazing including

2031.01 --> 2037.43
anxiety by the way which was troubled

2033.71 --> 2042.56
with regularly throughout my life has

2037.43 --> 2045.23
been very calm the last half year year

2042.56 --> 2047.69
for me except for the 82 of course but

2045.23 --> 2050.77
yeah that's when just that happens when

2047.69 --> 2056.69
you get to push from all sides at once I

2050.77 --> 2059.669
don't see that as a natural Fault on my

2056.69 --> 2067.44
system it was just overkill from the

2059.669 --> 2071.299
side so there is a circuit of these

2067.44 --> 2074.27
alternative medical people that are

2071.299 --> 2082.399
basically performing high-tech wizardry

2074.27 --> 2085.2599999999998
with neutral nutrition the spirit and

2082.399 --> 2089.19
natural healing functions it's just it's

2085.26 --> 2091.679
freakin magic it's as but as much it

2089.19 --> 2094.44
reminds me of priests healing magic as

2091.679 --> 2097.079
you can get pretty much and I've been

2094.44 --> 2100.02
yeah it's almost like I've been holding

2097.079 --> 2104.01
this back but it's just it's so much too

2100.02 --> 2106.44
much I can barely believe it but I've

2104.01 --> 2108.869
experienced it and there is extensive

2106.44 --> 2111.51
knowledge on this and people do apply it

2108.869 --> 2113.46
and it works the only time it doesn't

2111.51 --> 2115.71
work is when other people like are

2113.46 --> 2119.64
hating them when people are like I hate

2115.71 --> 2123.21
this I don't accept it when they

2119.64 --> 2126.45
actively reject it then yeah it won't

2123.21 --> 2128.2200000000003
work this sometimes even hell yeah that

2126.45 --> 2130.89
pretty much happens with so much

2128.22 --> 2131.2799999999997
everything by the way if you just reject

2130.89 --> 2134.3089999999997
it

2131.28 --> 2135.9300000000003
then any benefits such a substance

2134.309 --> 2137.849
whatever it's going to be is going to

2135.93 --> 2140.79
give is not going to be affecting you

2137.849 --> 2146.27
probably very unlikely let's it's a

2140.79 --> 2146.27
direct neural influencer so

2148.93 --> 2154.0899999999997
but it's kind of based on remember the

2152.32 --> 2156.01
yesterday I talked about the potion

2154.09 --> 2161.7000000000003
thing just putting my intentions in

2156.01 --> 2165.88
water it's kind of like that but electro

2161.7 --> 2169.1099999999997
electrical it's a device that kind of

2165.88 --> 2174.78
does that what I do

2169.11 --> 2178.42
based on separate systems um yeah on a

2174.78 --> 2180.5800000000004
mechanized system it's that exists

2178.42 --> 2186.9700000000003
apparently so technology is basically

2180.58 --> 2188.41
now adapting to the to the spiritual you

2186.97 --> 2197.5299999999997
could call her the energetic it's

2188.41 --> 2206.56
fascinating right so I don't know maybe

2197.53 --> 2210.3300000000004
a lot of people have not tuned out hmm

2206.56 --> 2213.64
right that's that's fascinating brendham

2210.33 --> 2215.17
that you really use that and you have to

2213.64 --> 2218.2
leave it overnight it's fascinating

2215.17 --> 2222.82
because remember there is there is

2218.2 --> 2226.72
something special with water being kept

2222.82 --> 2229.3
in copper bowls and remember there was

2226.72 --> 2232.06
even a device that was shown that I saw

2229.3 --> 2233.9500000000003
through Martin littke one time that's me

2232.06 --> 2236.74
it's a while ago now a device that was

2233.95 --> 2239.71
supposedly doing that with water and

2236.74 --> 2241.5099999999998
that water somehow it was enhanced so

2239.71 --> 2242.98
the cup was basically a sitting on

2241.51 --> 2246.3700000000003
something that was emitting an

2242.98 --> 2249.19
electricity somehow doing something was

2246.37 --> 2253.0499999999997
closed in the in the box underneath it

2249.19 --> 2257.08
and that water could then be used for

2253.05 --> 2261.73
for amazing application from what I've

2257.08 --> 2265.12
heard used to yeah you could make rocks

2261.73 --> 2269.2
float by dousing it in that water once

2265.12 --> 2270.58
it was magnetized or whatever you're

2269.2 --> 2273.25
going to call I don't know exactly what

2270.58 --> 2274.96
is magnetized and you applied certain

2273.25 --> 2277.57
sound frequencies and it was supposed to

2274.96 --> 2280.63
levitate in other frequencies it would

2277.57 --> 2282.84
cause that rock to be malleable that's

2280.63 --> 2286.09
one of the

2282.84 --> 2289.8700000000003
ideas I've heard and fascinated that to

2286.09 --> 2294.82
see if that could work if that ancient

2289.87 --> 2299.64
tech is that basic because who wouldn't

2294.82 --> 2303.4
want to try that out you know so maybe

2299.64 --> 2307.65
yeah it is kind of related fascinated to

2303.4 --> 2307.65
learn more about that device

2321.359 --> 2329.869
nice that is really cool

2337.12 --> 2346.18
you know what I think there are like

2342.16 --> 2348.5499999999997
even the more luxurious teep I've seen

2346.18 --> 2351.8199999999997
luxurious teapots that were made of

2348.55 --> 2357.2200000000003
copper as well I thought it was kind of

2351.82 --> 2363.6600000000003
weird but now thinking maybe that is

2357.22 --> 2367.75
actually something I should try out huh

2363.66 --> 2372.0699999999997
see it was everywhere I've learned this

2367.75 --> 2373.66
like probably 20 years ago originally

2372.07 --> 2380.71
and it just completely forgot about it

2373.66 --> 2382.1099999999997
and it's already present and just didn't

2380.71 --> 2386.8
know about it you just think like my

2382.11 --> 2388.9300000000003
copper weird but now that kind of makes

2386.8 --> 2392.19
sense that you would want to use copper

2388.93 --> 2392.19
it's fascinating

2393.96 --> 2401.66
oh my god

2399.17 --> 2405.4500000000003
this is hilarious

2401.66 --> 2408.72
I'm thinking just just think about this

2405.45 --> 2411.2
in a historical context the supposed

2408.72 --> 2413.64
buildup of civilization and that

2411.2 --> 2417.1499999999996
originally was like the Stone Age and

2413.64 --> 2419.0989999999997
then came the the bronze or the Copper

2417.15 --> 2424.08
Age and people would be using copper

2419.099 --> 2427.05
tools like so primitive but hey if they

2424.08 --> 2431.69
used copper tools for agriculture

2427.05 --> 2437.6400000000003
well that would actually be very good

2431.69 --> 2439.9500000000003
isn't that hysterical right so they

2437.64 --> 2442.5299999999997
weren't like ooh oh look at you with the

2439.95 --> 2446.7
copper tools there's a primitive no

2442.53 --> 2448.88
that's actually really good how ironic

2446.7 --> 2448.8799999999997
is that

2450.95 --> 2457.1699999999996
so maybe the original figuring out of

2454.26 --> 2459.8900000000003
using copper for tools is what even

2457.17 --> 2462.33
spawned civilization what made

2459.89 --> 2464.609
agriculture flourish in order to for

2462.33 --> 2468.869
civilization and basically lazy people

2464.609 --> 2473.49
doing other stuff to come into being and

2468.869 --> 2476.78
yeah maybe it was the copper that humans

2473.49 --> 2476.7799999999997
originally started applying

2507.12 --> 2510.3199999999997
[Music]

2527.29 --> 2534.55
mmm the Illuminati Castle is nice that's

2531.8 --> 2534.55
a little dry

2538.32 --> 2541.809
[Music]

2547.46 --> 2556.03
so yeah learned a lot today and I shared

2551.51 --> 2566.6600000000003
some interesting models new concepts to

2556.03 --> 2568.88
think about and hey wouldn't a gaseous

2566.66 --> 2571.42
universe be much prettier to look at

2568.88 --> 2571.42
basically

2576.0 --> 2588.45
I think that that type of painting would

2578.7 --> 2594.8399999999997
be even more amazing it would be almost

2588.45 --> 2597.87
like those real trippy fantasy planet

2594.84 --> 2599.67
type painters like those Street painters

2597.87 --> 2601.2
that would quickly make these things and

2599.67 --> 2603.69
then sell them in boulevards and

2601.2 --> 2606.4199999999996
everything it would be that type of

2603.69 --> 2609.54
universe because yeah hey it's gas

2606.42 --> 2611.34
everywhere but gas is gonna have some

2609.54 --> 2618.5299999999997
kind of light influence on a certain

2611.34 --> 2618.53
scale would be amazing

2643.34 --> 2645.34
ah

2647.72 --> 2656.45
okay right what happens

2658.4 --> 2664.1800000000003
somebody made a funny comment earlier I

2660.56 --> 2664.18
want to respond to that where is it

2669.38 --> 2673.7490000000003
wait no I misread it dope

2694.64 --> 2701.16
fascinating Brandon I'm is this really

2698.91 --> 2706.14
cool that that you're already into this

2701.16 --> 2715.64
it's just like what it was there all

2706.14 --> 2715.64
along why did you not tell me

2728.89 --> 2739.359
I think Pedro from Lewin is naturally

2736.119 --> 2744.73
high on this globe model fantasy in

2739.359 --> 2748.21
Charon be you know that many people can

2744.73 --> 2751.749
experience very similar yeah natural

2748.21 --> 2755.19
drug-induced experiences that correlate

2751.749 --> 2757.2389999999996
very narrowly to when you take drugs

2755.19 --> 2759.4
even though they've never taken the

2757.239 --> 2762.9990000000003
drugs that stimulants will just

2759.4 --> 2764.92
naturally arrive as an extra inspiration

2762.999 --> 2768.4889999999996
when they engage in certain activities

2764.92 --> 2773.039
so maybe he is high he is high on the

2768.489 --> 2778.23
globe and that makes everything possible

2773.039 --> 2778.23
it is kind of like being high I guess I

2778.499 --> 2784.839
do get a little high when I talk about

2781.329 --> 2787.21
my globe presuppositional extrapolations

2784.839 --> 2789.3089999999997
I find it that's why I keep on doing it

2787.21 --> 2791.68
because I do find it kind of stimulating

2789.309 --> 2795.63
it's just kind of stupid to believe

2791.68 --> 2795.6299999999997
that's really real that's all

2808.6 --> 2811.65
Oh God

2814.04 --> 2821.22
patron level you're not getting it when

2818.64 --> 2824.66
you're dealing with Heights height

2821.22 --> 2827.87
references basically a literal height

2824.66 --> 2831.42
that is relevant in orthographic views

2827.87 --> 2834.5699999999997
but when it's concerning actual optics

2831.42 --> 2837.6
and observations there's the angular

2834.57 --> 2841.4900000000002
height or size is completely different

2837.6 --> 2844.49
so what you're suggesting is just it's

2841.49 --> 2844.49
incorrect

2851.4 --> 2857.509
that Brenda stop it

2864.66 --> 2871.5699999999997
Brenda look I if you're gonna keep on

2868.54 --> 2875.92
behaving like this Brenda Brennan from

2871.57 --> 2878.17
the Asin right then I will literally ban

2875.92 --> 2882.64
you like Lottie so you have to stop

2878.17 --> 2885.2200000000003
misbehaving don't go doing that in my

2882.64 --> 2887.44
chat I think I keep on unbanning you

2885.22 --> 2889.4399999999996
every time but you keep on misbehaving

2887.44 --> 2893.17
stop doing that why are you coming here

2889.44 --> 2894.94
just piss around like that you're

2893.17 --> 2898.83
wasting everyone's time including your

2894.94 --> 2898.83
own there's no point to this

2908.58 --> 2911.69
[Music]

2916.62 --> 2926.93
okay thanks for the link five artists

2922.13 --> 2926.9300000000003
I'll definitely check it out right now

2938.44 --> 2941.039
Wow

2943.23 --> 2947.67
oh [ __ ] I'm gonna have to show this to

2946.46 --> 2957.9900000000002
Beijing

2947.67 --> 2964.67
he's gonna go nuts man that's yeah

2957.99 --> 2964.6699999999996
that's a real this is real book it's big

2968.52 --> 2975.92
okay I'm gonna definitely save that link

2971.82 --> 2982.1000000000004
that's a really good one thanks for that

2975.92 --> 2982.1
let's see if I can can you download this

2989.43 --> 2991.46
Oh

2994.42 --> 3003.89
hmm yeah five artists lemur Alice if if

2999.43 --> 3009.049
you're like part of this cut you perhaps

3003.89 --> 3009.049
can i download it is that easy to do

3014.48 --> 3021.19
yeah nice 134 pages

3022.359 --> 3026.66
save the PDF okay I got it

3025.46 --> 3028.4
awesome now I have it on my computer

3026.66 --> 3031.0
it's never gonna go away again

3028.4 --> 3033.4700000000003
that is awesome thanks for to the

3031.0 --> 3036.609
definitely thanks for the link everybody

3033.47 --> 3036.609
else do check it out

3049.32 --> 3052.32
awesome

3061.17 --> 3066.64
who

3062.769 --> 3069.64
I think Dacian may have even mentioned

3066.64 --> 3071.259
this guy and I just overlooked it so I

3069.64 --> 3074.439
probably already know it is this funny

3071.259 --> 3077.429
how these things all come together it's

3074.439 --> 3077.4289999999996
just crazy

3078.359 --> 3083.519
this is just like a totally overlooked

3084.059 --> 3095.3390000000004
no insight in how things work all of it

3092.039 --> 3095.3390000000004
my god

3099.599 --> 3102.259
huh

3104.82 --> 3113.79
it's incredible this book is

3106.53 --> 3116.76
mind-boggling thanks for that right so

3113.79 --> 3117.42
yeah well okay I've pretty much wasted

3116.76 --> 3121.0800000000004
my time

3117.42 --> 3123.89
owing at it but man thanks for that

3121.08 --> 3131.04
that's awesome I I am gonna look into it

3123.89 --> 3133.8199999999997
hmm what's that link you made all right

3131.04 --> 3137.85
he had the PDF version right right oh

3133.82 --> 3145.17
wait it's another yeah it's another type

3137.85 --> 3147.77
of print bigger letters I think I like

3145.17 --> 3147.77
the other one better

3160.61 --> 3165.2000000000003
okay Daniel good luck of that

3171.39 --> 3176.7799999999997
all right there's some cobble ISM in it

3173.49 --> 3176.7799999999997
oh why not

3201.48 --> 3210.69
yeah oh right oh well yeah I'm not look

3206.72 --> 3213.27
with this stuff I literally don't give a

3210.69 --> 3216.66
[ __ ] about the scientific method or

3213.27 --> 3219.839
anything because I mostly just care

3216.66 --> 3223.859
about results and if this stuff yields

3219.839 --> 3228.93
results then that is to be taken into

3223.859 --> 3231.42
account you know I'm just going straight

3228.93 --> 3233.79
to the Applied Sciences and if I really

3231.42 --> 3236.07
get it then I might be able to figure

3233.79 --> 3238.65
out another application for that type of

3236.07 --> 3245.6090000000004
science in whatever fashion maybe even

3238.65 --> 3248.369
just subtly so I'm not gonna claim

3245.609 --> 3252.15
science over this definitely not gonna

3248.369 --> 3255.8900000000003
bring it up at Nathan's this is my

3252.15 --> 3255.89
subject this is my show

3262.83 --> 3267.1
yeah Brenda you are your

3265.93 --> 3270.0099999999998
overgeneralizing

3267.1 --> 3273.19
again and you first came in just

3270.01 --> 3276.78
attacking somebody and I told you not to

3273.19 --> 3276.78
do that so stop it

3299.029 --> 3312.289
okay this time it's permanent piss off

3304.319 --> 3312.2889999999998
Renda I'm sick of you stupid drone

3353.28 --> 3356.28
now

3366.23 --> 3379.7
okay gotta go with you on this one a jam

3374.38 --> 3384.829
this is on you everything she's gonna be

3379.7 --> 3388.8199999999997
doing in chat from now on is on you you

3384.829 --> 3391.73
know what I'm gonna give you a wrench

3388.82 --> 3393.26
you decide on Brenda it's now Brenda's

3391.73 --> 3403.849
now your responsibility for the

3393.26 --> 3405.5890000000004
remainder of the Hangout hmm so not that

3403.849 --> 3409.329
that's gonna last very long because I

3405.589 --> 3409.3289999999997
was just about to round it out anyway

3409.66 --> 3415.43
but yeah if you want to be lenient with

3412.43 --> 3418.0989999999997
these persistently annoying people that

3415.43 --> 3422.48
are just trolling then you take

3418.099 --> 3427.76
responsibility because I don't want to

3422.48 --> 3429.44
these people they just ruin everything

3427.76 --> 3431.21
they ruin the atmosphere they ruin

3429.44 --> 3434.75
people's focus everybody goes troll

3431.21 --> 3438.5
baiting after Brenda and I'm sick of it

3434.75 --> 3439.49
and also disappointed at you for always

3438.5 --> 3444.71
doing that

3439.49 --> 3446.8999999999996
you're so easily seduced stop being so

3444.71 --> 3450.8
easily seduced stop being so troll Betty

3446.9 --> 3455.06
please people all of you in chat all of

3450.8 --> 3459.53
you including my regulars like it's not

3455.06 --> 3464.9
good to do that it's fun can be fun but

3459.53 --> 3466.88
don't let it distract you please that's

3464.9 --> 3469.52
pretty much the reason why I am banning

3466.88 --> 3471.079
her because she's not willing to attune

3469.52 --> 3474.609
to the show

3471.079 --> 3474.6090000000004
and it's just being disruptive

3480.12 --> 3483.12
so

3501.73 --> 3504.96
all right Karen

3505.32 --> 3510.15
you don't have to be militant about it

3507.39 --> 3514.65
but I agree this is my channel I have

3510.15 --> 3517.4100000000003
very specific code of conduct rules for

3514.65 --> 3521.4300000000003
moderators and for the public and have

3517.41 --> 3524.79
to find it very well I've been pretty

3521.43 --> 3527.85
persistent I think been trying out

3524.79 --> 3530.97
things and adjusting but overall it's

3527.85 --> 3535.68
pretty much the same level just no

3530.97 --> 3541.58
prefer that [ __ ] no aggravated attacking

3535.68 --> 3545.0299999999997
no accusations of really terrible things

3541.58 --> 3548.0099999999998
and things will be alright

3545.03 --> 3550.61
and no banning people as a moderator if

3548.01 --> 3554.1000000000004
just because they oppose your opinion

3550.61 --> 3559.9500000000003
unless they're being like only trolling

3554.1 --> 3564.0499999999997
you but I prefer you not respond to that

3559.95 --> 3564.0499999999997
and leave such thing over to meet

3584.43 --> 3589.74
yeah well what'd you say Jose that's up

3587.609 --> 3592.2599999999998
to you in your channel that's how you

3589.74 --> 3593.4799999999996
want to do it and you're gonna bear the

3592.26 --> 3597.2400000000002
consequences of it

3593.48 --> 3599.4
and I'm gonna do how I'm gonna do it and

3597.24 --> 3602.6899999999996
I'm gonna bear the consequences of that

3599.4 --> 3606.869
and I'm very full aware of the results

3602.69 --> 3610.829
although not for the widest of audiences

3606.869 --> 3613.38
I don't don't exactly know yet how that

3610.829 --> 3615.599
works or even if I could reach out to

3613.38 --> 3618.809
that or if I'm being artificially choked

3615.599 --> 3621.299
by the algorithm I don't know I don't

3618.809 --> 3623.099
know if I can adapt and then get a wider

3621.299 --> 3626.4
audience or if the algorithm just

3623.099 --> 3628.799
doesn't allow that because yeah to be

3626.4 --> 3632.579
fair I've been very persistently around

3628.799 --> 3636.39
and Nathan suggested yeah do a daily

3632.579 --> 3639.42
show and it's gonna explode well I do a

3636.39 --> 3641.19
daily show for half a year and I've had

3639.42 --> 3647.16
a channel before that for three years at

3641.19 --> 3648.779
least and I do have a few subscribers

3647.16 --> 3652.77
and they absolutely thank everyone that

3648.779 --> 3656.279
has subscribed to me and that is

3652.77 --> 3660.5389999999998
following my show but it's still yeah

3656.279 --> 3666.02
the growth rate is not exponential izing

3660.539 --> 3669.599
it's just a steady linear slow growth

3666.02 --> 3673.2
it's not at a standstill but it's just

3669.599 --> 3675.809
so incredibly slow even though yeah I do

3673.2 --> 3678.4199999999996
get promoted and I do promote myself and

3675.809 --> 3681.299
literally I try to make connections I'm

3678.42 --> 3683.13
like a public figure in chat that's what

3681.299 --> 3685.98
it comes down to when you have a show

3683.13 --> 3689.4300000000003
like this I am considering myself as a

3685.98 --> 3691.589
social media public figure everything I

3689.43 --> 3693.75
do I'm assuming it's gonna be tracked

3691.589 --> 3695.88
it's gotta be kept

3693.75 --> 3697.92
record off the people are gonna try to

3695.88 --> 3699.7200000000003
troll me with everything kind of try to

3697.92 --> 3702.059
maybe at some point even try to

3699.72 --> 3705.3289999999997
blackmail me or something once I really

3702.059 --> 3708.329
get get going for example financially I

3705.329 --> 3710.1600000000003
don't know they're gonna try it so I am

3708.329 --> 3713.94
kind of a public figure I'm already

3710.16 --> 3716.73
trying to adapt myself to that and I

3713.94 --> 3718.11
take very few risks with it but I do

3716.73 --> 3720.14
take some

3718.11 --> 3730.53
sometimes you have to like make a stand

3720.14 --> 3733.25
in some way I take it very seriously my

3730.53 --> 3736.32
attitude and if I'm gonna let myself go

3733.25 --> 3740.04
in some way like get really pissed off

3736.32 --> 3743.4
or super aggressive I try never to do it

3740.04 --> 3747.39
but sometimes I especially try never to

3743.4 --> 3749.58
do it when I feel weak and then do it

3747.39 --> 3751.5
like as a like a fever effect like

3749.58 --> 3752.16
trying to get rid of the stress never do

3751.5 --> 3755.31
that never

3752.16 --> 3757.2599999999998
I recommend never to do that unless you

3755.31 --> 3760.11
could like do chopping wood or something

3757.26 --> 3766.44
in that way isolated never doing itself

3760.11 --> 3769.38
with social situations but sometimes you

3766.44 --> 3772.83
have to make a stand because I get I

3769.38 --> 3777.21
have people that literally kind of stalk

3772.83 --> 3778.62
me on social media and they keep on they

3777.21 --> 3780.48
have been doing it for years and

3778.62 --> 3782.43
sometimes they lose interest and then

3780.48 --> 3784.11
they come back again and it's

3782.43 --> 3786.8399999999997
practically stalking me and sometimes I

3784.11 --> 3791.52
just have to like show them like this is

3786.84 --> 3795.15
I'm seriously sick of it and I'm gonna

3791.52 --> 3799.2
like literally go dark on you

3795.15 --> 3804.09
specifically and if you don't cut it out

3799.2 --> 3806.6699999999996
and I tried to minimize that as much as

3804.09 --> 3809.9100000000003
possible but it it's just like face to

3806.67 --> 3812.55
face the guy or somebody keeps on

3809.91 --> 3814.0499999999997
bullying you for whatever reason and

3812.55 --> 3818.52
they won't stop you have to at some

3814.05 --> 3820.32
point just show your aggression and make

3818.52 --> 3822.98
a stand and that's this is the only

3820.32 --> 3826.79
thing I can do about it not that it

3822.98 --> 3826.79
matters so much but

3827.72 --> 3840.23
I can't just ignore it all it's just I

3833.78 --> 3844.8190000000004
can't really do that in the sense that I

3840.23 --> 3846.97
can pretend to ignore it but I pretty

3844.819 --> 3852.17
much noticed everything it's one of the

3846.97 --> 3855.25
more negative side effects of just

3852.17 --> 3860.54
observed being extremely observant and

3855.25 --> 3864.849
having a strong having strong sensory

3860.54 --> 3868.0099999999998
and some strong sensory receivership

3864.849 --> 3871.339
doing a lot with the information that I

3868.01 --> 3874.9900000000002
perceive with my brain so I take notice

3871.339 --> 3874.99
of things even when I don't want to

3876.52 --> 3882.589
and then yeah because of that I just

3880.099 --> 3884.569
have to do that so it does happen and I

3882.589 --> 3888.44
did it to Lottie and I basically went

3884.569 --> 3892.0099999999998
all out and said like yeah you gotta end

3888.44 --> 3893.839
it you are such a miserable [ __ ] you

3892.01 --> 3899.329
got it yeah and that's a terrible thing

3893.839 --> 3903.069
to say but and I would never say that to

3899.329 --> 3908.569
hurt somebody but in this case in that

3903.069 --> 3911.9
moment that was real and then even

3908.569 --> 3915.41
though that's wrong if it is really

3911.9 --> 3921.6800000000003
genuinely real in that moment then yeah

3915.41 --> 3925.31
I will do it and I will definitely not

3921.68 --> 3926.7799999999997
repeat that over time but I will do that

3925.31 --> 3931.31
kind of thing and you've noticed this

3926.78 --> 3933.38
for me and I try to be consistent but if

3931.31 --> 3937.5789999999997
I just shut up all the time it always be

3933.38 --> 3942.1400000000003
the goody-goody guy then it wouldn't

3937.579 --> 3943.6400000000003
work I as a person wouldn't function the

3942.14 --> 3946.7599999999998
same

3943.64 --> 3948.89
I would not have this sensation of

3946.76 --> 3951.44
freedom in my being if I couldn't ever

3948.89 --> 3954.29
do that if I had to hide all of that it

3951.44 --> 3960.17
pretend like nothing was there like I

3954.29 --> 3962.54
didn't have these elements so ah man I'm

3960.17 --> 3966.02
talking about 50 minutes about this [ __ ]

3962.54 --> 3969.71
so right yeah misbehaviour I don't like

3966.02 --> 3973.16
it but if somebody pushes you really

3969.71 --> 3975.4700000000003
badly even though others may not

3973.16 --> 3979.46
experience it as that badly or are used

3975.47 --> 3981.3799999999997
at it or something then yeah I think it

3979.46 --> 3984.11
is good to explode as long as you

3981.38 --> 3986.06
minimize and don't from there on start

3984.11 --> 3988.85
behaving like that because then you're

3986.06 --> 3995.72
screwed and you're screwing everyone so

3988.85 --> 3998.18
but yeah moments moments that's it so

3995.72 --> 4000.1
yeah Nathan is on indeed I'm gonna round

3998.18 --> 4003.49

4038.95 --> 4046.5099999999998
hat is might actually just come into

4041.83 --> 4048.58
being pretty quickly maybe before the

4046.51 --> 4051.4900000000002
halfway point of the year even so that

4048.58 --> 4056.62
can't wait but it's it's working out

4051.49 --> 4059.5899999999997
pretty good and yeah until the next oh

4056.62 --> 4062.62
hold on before I go that still have to

4059.59 --> 4067.0
mention please do support my show like

4062.62 --> 4069.79
for example brand M did when she yeah

4067.0 --> 4073.42
they came member of my patreon for life

4069.79 --> 4074.74
no no less so that's like yeah nobody's

4073.42 --> 4076.9300000000003
ever done that

4074.74 --> 4078.91
and I yeah truly want to thank you

4076.93 --> 4081.22
Brandon for having that much faith in me

4078.91 --> 4084.0099999999998
and supporting me on the long run like

4081.22 --> 4089.3199999999997
that is really awesome I will do my best

4084.01 --> 4092.44
to make it up and to stay to keep on

4089.32 --> 4095.29
doing what I do and yeah five four to

4092.44 --> 4099.85
sleep around I get a lot of bad folks

4095.29 --> 4101.95
it's it's Brenda from arason and Lottie

4099.85 --> 4104.35
and all that they they have they really

4101.95 --> 4107.88
hate my guts they really don't like it

4104.35 --> 4109.6900000000005
because I don't adapt to their [ __ ] I

4107.88 --> 4113.2
don't do it

4109.69 --> 4118.419999999999
I refuse to entertain it in any fashion

4113.2 --> 4119.41
I don't let it blow past and I don't

4118.42 --> 4122.47
adapt

4119.41 --> 4127.15
I just freaking kick them in the face is

4122.47 --> 4134.56
basically say piss off your subhuman

4127.15 --> 4136.54
scum bags that's what I do and that's

4134.56 --> 4138.700000000001
why they throw me persistently like this

4136.54 --> 4140.83
and try to make me look bad and like

4138.7 --> 4143.38
nobody's interested in me because I am

4140.83 --> 4147.16
directly their opponent their long run

4143.38 --> 4148.93
long term hostiles and not talking about

4147.16 --> 4151.33
the general ball or public but these

4148.93 --> 4154.39
people that are trolling us that are

4151.33 --> 4159.58
constantly trying to drone their ball

4154.39 --> 4162.280000000001
[ __ ] with us they are hostile to us on

4159.58 --> 4165.55
the long run they're never gonna go away

4162.28 --> 4168.639999999999
ever and it will probably go too crazy

4165.55 --> 4171.28
lengths in order to somehow disrupt us

4168.64 --> 4174.910000000001
discourage us so be prepared for

4171.28 --> 4177.28
anything these people are nuts they're

4174.91 --> 4180.84
just like social just just as warrior

4177.28 --> 4184.03
and Tifa crazies they're nuts

4180.84 --> 4189.360000000001
Pia Mars is as well although it does

4184.03 --> 4193.21
have his normal moments Lottie and

4189.36 --> 4195.429999999999
Brenda and there's a couple of these

4193.21 --> 4197.56
figures especially from the older Flat

4195.43 --> 4201.01
Earth debate guards that are absolutely

4197.56 --> 4202.6
nuts potentially dangerous people even

4201.01 --> 4204.4800000000005
though it might not constantly express

4202.6 --> 4208.26
itself

4204.48 --> 4210.87
just nuts not NASA shields they're

4208.26 --> 4212.79
insane people they are insane people

4210.87 --> 4216.66
that have chosen their region to

4212.79 --> 4219.39
basically be hostile Xin and bash

4216.66 --> 4223.86
everything down that's what they're

4219.39 --> 4225.81
doing nobody's paying them to do that

4223.86 --> 4227.759999999999
I'm pretty convinced that probably

4225.81 --> 4230.9400000000005
nobody's paying them to do that maybe

4227.76 --> 4233.9400000000005
some of the more tinkerers like rumpus

4230.94 --> 4236.54
or something right and what's the other

4233.94 --> 4236.54
guy again

4237.74 --> 4242.37
who's that's personally went to space

4240.15 --> 4246.629999999999
these guys yeah they might have

4242.37 --> 4248.49
connections but the the bad ballers that

4246.63 --> 4251.79
constantly keep controlling that this

4248.49 --> 4254.34
court freaks that they don't they're not

4251.79 --> 4257.34
chillin they are literally insane people

4254.34 --> 4258.93
obsessed over this [ __ ] and their only

4257.34 --> 4266.49
thing they can do is just try to ruin

4258.93 --> 4268.110000000001
everybody's life so again I rants just

4266.49 --> 4273.66
needed to get that off my chest for a

4268.11 --> 4275.849999999999
moment but yeah please do support me

4273.66 --> 4277.98
through my channel with the super chat

4275.85 --> 4279.72
sometimes I don't necessarily even need

4277.98 --> 4281.79
that I do get some money in from

4279.72 --> 4285.570000000001
advertisement again today I did get

4281.79 --> 4289.05
Google money so it seems to be roughly

4285.57 --> 4292.0199999999995
between like 80 and 100 euros that I'm

4289.05 --> 4294.51
now getting apparently it's really sized

4292.02 --> 4297.42
up to the advertisement money so I'm

4294.51 --> 4299.76
pretty amazed by that and thanks

4297.42 --> 4301.5
everybody for actually sitting through

4299.76 --> 4303.360000000001
that I know advertisement can be

4301.5 --> 4305.94
annoying and I apologize for that

4303.36 --> 4309.719999999999
but it really does help me significantly

4305.94 --> 4311.969999999999
if this keeps on going yeah and it's not

4309.72 --> 4314.31
even dependent on the super chats but

4311.97 --> 4318.240000000001
extra support will definitely help me

4314.31 --> 4322.410000000001
out and I still have a project open like

4318.24 --> 4325.92
the GoFundMe for my p1000 and I yeah I

4322.41 --> 4327.11
would very much like to see that get to

4325.92 --> 4331.53
its full potential

4327.11 --> 4333.75
which is now set at 1065 euros for

4331.53 --> 4339.929999999999
ap1000 and it's

4333.75 --> 4343.02
a tripod for it and I will at some point

4339.93 --> 4345.2390000000005
do a real our winner or whinnying tongue

4343.02 --> 4349.26
or a winner tongue how are you gonna

4345.239 --> 4351.69
call it for that p1000 but not just yet

4349.26 --> 4353.969

4351.69 --> 4355.65

4353.969 --> 4361.199
some support from the Flat Earth debate

4355.65 --> 4363.03
guys if they still like me so yeah any

4361.199 --> 4365.94
