beyond the clouds because there are

126.399 --> 129.84
plenty of clouds around

132.16 --> 135.52
but yeah

133.28 --> 138.0
in between clouds it's still really nice

135.52 --> 138.0
and sunny

138.879 --> 143.12
clouds go in front of the sun however it

140.959 --> 145.36
gets kind of chilly

143.12 --> 145.36
so

145.92 --> 148.23899999999998

194.879 --> 198.66

198.66 --> 201.879
[Music]

209.68 --> 213.84
hey jedo good to see you

222.64 --> 224.95899999999997
right

225.68 --> 230.15900000000002
so yeah yesterday's show was a blast i

228.4 --> 232.64000000000001
was very glad to

230.159 --> 235.519
figure out a name for it because that

232.64 --> 237.27999999999997
was a very interesting discussion about

235.519 --> 240.56
the differences between information

237.28 --> 242.799
knowledge and wisdom

240.56 --> 246.0
and i could even

242.799 --> 248.31900000000002
expand thinking about it today expand

246.0 --> 250.239
upon it a little bit

248.319 --> 252.319
to five

250.239 --> 253.68
right

252.319 --> 256.959
god

253.68 --> 259.44
information knowledge wisdom

256.959 --> 262.44
instinct

259.44 --> 262.44
ah

279.52 --> 284.56
this

281.52 --> 287.03999999999996
okay jedo finally got your wife to tune

284.56 --> 289.04
in to nathan's show then he uses the

287.04 --> 291.91900000000004
then he says [ __ ]

289.04 --> 295.16
25 times yeah

291.919 --> 295.15999999999997
it happens

304.88 --> 310.52
sorry that's just really funny

307.52 --> 310.52
uh

312.72 --> 319.6
but it's also funny because like us guys

316.88 --> 322.639
we listen to that and we kind of like

319.6 --> 325.28000000000003
overlook that constantly to just get to

322.639 --> 327.759
the get to the gems get to the the

325.28 --> 330.32
context right

327.759 --> 332.0
but then if you let some oh oh i listen

330.32 --> 334.15999999999997
to this all the time it's really epic

332.0 --> 338.24
i'm learning so much and then you

334.16 --> 339.12
let somebody listen to it and it's like

338.24 --> 340.72
numpty

339.12 --> 342.88
[Music]

340.72 --> 343.759
and then it's like oh [ __ ] wait

342.88 --> 345.36
she

343.759 --> 347.44
or they aren't

345.36 --> 349.44
like used to it blocking it out yet so

347.44 --> 353.24
it's like oh yeah oops

349.44 --> 353.24
i get it hilarious

354.639 --> 356.88
uh

357.759 --> 364.319
don't use it here my wife's like like

359.84 --> 364.31899999999996
you well i don't use it lightly the word

364.639 --> 367.639
so

368.96 --> 375.039
i do still use it but only when i'm like

372.88 --> 377.039
really pissed off at somebody right and

375.039 --> 378.88
i don't use it over and over again but i

377.039 --> 380.4
don't really need to

378.88 --> 381.6
of course

380.4 --> 383.919
because

381.6 --> 386.47900000000004
nobody's like verbally speaking to me on

383.919 --> 386.479
this show

386.56 --> 390.319
so they don't have to ram it in there

392.08 --> 395.479
that's the difference

410.0 --> 412.88
9 30

411.599 --> 415.84
pin

412.88 --> 415.84
austria what

416.639 --> 419.599
you mean pm

417.65 --> 422.599
[Music]

419.599 --> 422.599
what

428.96 --> 432.919
right thought so

437.12 --> 440.319
anyway

438.0 --> 440.319
yeah

442.8 --> 446.8
i watched the video

444.8 --> 448.8
before this show it was really

446.8 --> 450.96000000000004
interesting

448.8 --> 453.52000000000004
the delving into that again from mind

450.96 --> 453.52
unveiled

453.919 --> 457.68
about well

456.0 --> 460.8
dubious

457.68 --> 463.36
background of pigs and

460.8 --> 466.0
like why would certain religions like

463.36 --> 468.40000000000003
forbid you from eating pig and like he

466.0 --> 469.919
really dove into that

468.4 --> 471.919
i thought it was a really good video it

469.919 --> 475.28
was very broad it wasn't just one

471.919 --> 479.84
conclusion and hammering it down

475.28 --> 479.84
so yeah very much worth watching

481.919 --> 488.639
right i happen to basically back

485.52 --> 493.08
a lot of his assertions i don't eat pig

488.639 --> 493.08
i haven't eaten pigs since

495.12 --> 500.919
wow

497.28 --> 505.479
since a long time like since

500.919 --> 505.479
2006 i think

507.039 --> 511.919
this it was even weird because even when

509.199 --> 514.479
i was younger

511.919 --> 516.88
i was really young i really liked it

514.479 --> 519.12
certain things

516.88 --> 521.919
like bacon of course and then after some

519.12 --> 523.599
point i kind of like

521.919 --> 525.1999999999999
i don't know what it was but i just

523.599 --> 527.839
didn't want it anymore maybe it's

525.2 --> 530.0
because maybe it's after i like first

527.839 --> 531.839
saw

530.0 --> 534.16
living pigs and all that

531.839 --> 535.839
and i recognized how freaking smart they

534.16 --> 538.0
were as social

535.839 --> 538.9590000000001
maybe that that was it

538.0 --> 542.399
i don't know

538.959 --> 542.399
i don't remember exactly

544.399 --> 547.399
but

548.88 --> 555.92
the tone's garbage yeah well that's one

553.12 --> 556.9590000000001
one application right but like what are

555.92 --> 561.7199999999999
they

556.959 --> 561.7199999999999
where does this come from where and like

565.04 --> 570.16
like were like these are one of some of

567.36 --> 573.76
the questions that uh mind unfilled also

570.16 --> 577.76
ask is like were pigs originally humans

573.76 --> 580.56
transformed into pigs like our pigs like

577.76 --> 582.88
magical creatures basically that didn't

580.56 --> 585.1199999999999
exist before

582.88 --> 587.279
humans were transformed into pigs and

585.12 --> 589.279
then like he also shows

587.279 --> 591.4399999999999
pieces of the movie willow

589.279 --> 595.6
in which like this dark witch turns an

591.44 --> 595.6
entire army of men into pigs

595.839 --> 599.36
yeah

596.88 --> 601.8389999999999
maybe that was it man

599.36 --> 603.519
maybe watching willow did that i don't

601.839 --> 605.6800000000001
know

603.519 --> 607.36
there's like a lot of suggestions from

605.68 --> 608.56
all directions that there's something up

607.36 --> 609.76
with pig

608.56 --> 613.04
with pigs

609.76 --> 613.04
in different ways

616.48 --> 619.839
low flatter sage

632.0 --> 637.12
also by the way yeah a little just the

634.56 --> 639.8389999999999
detail that i didn't even know about

637.12 --> 643.44
that he also put in there

639.839 --> 645.6800000000001
that apparently it was argued by certain

643.44 --> 648.0790000000001
priests i guess

645.68 --> 650.959
that pigs were supposedly unclean

648.079 --> 652.4799999999999
because they didn't

650.959 --> 654.4799999999999
uh

652.48 --> 656.32
don't forgot

654.48 --> 657.6
the word was it like

656.32 --> 660.0790000000001
they didn't like

657.6 --> 663.12
they don't throw up and re-chew like

660.079 --> 664.7199999999999
cows do and goats apparently also do

663.12 --> 667.279
that i think

664.72 --> 668.32
right and pigs don't do that

667.279 --> 670.56
and

668.32 --> 673.44
maybe that was or at least it was

670.56 --> 675.3599999999999
suggested as a reason for it or argued

673.44 --> 679.2
by priests right but this could be

675.36 --> 679.2
afterward way afterward

680.079 --> 684.0
after

681.12 --> 686.839
kind of like the new format of humanity

684.0 --> 690.399
had already settled post flood and all

686.839 --> 692.6400000000001
that right but yeah maybe

690.399 --> 694.8
you know

692.64 --> 696.0
maybe pigs were

694.8 --> 699.4399999999999
like

696.0 --> 701.76
a human mutation just like during

699.44 --> 703.9200000000001
or pre-flood when there was all kinds of

701.76 --> 704.88
monsters being made

703.92 --> 706.88
through

704.88 --> 708.64
suspected genetic engineering of some

706.88 --> 711.04
kind

708.64 --> 714.959
that maybe pigs actually came out of

711.04 --> 716.56
that and then kind of stuck with us

714.959 --> 718.6389999999999
right that they weren't

716.56 --> 720.56
destroyed i don't know it's

718.639 --> 723.04
there's all kinds of ways to think about

720.56 --> 726.04
it it's very complicated

723.04 --> 726.04
anyway

732.16 --> 736.959
pigs are unclean as they wallow in their

734.16 --> 740.56
own fields no that's

736.959 --> 742.3199999999999
no that's actually not true

740.56 --> 744.8
yeah

742.32 --> 747.2
you might not know this but pigs are

744.8 --> 748.24
actually hygienic

747.2 --> 751.0400000000001
as in

748.24 --> 754.399
they don't roll around in their own [ __ ]

751.04 --> 757.959
they like to roll around in mud

754.399 --> 757.959
not in [ __ ]

758.0 --> 762.56
mean if shit's all they got it's kind of

760.48 --> 763.76
mixed up with mud yeah then now i guess

762.56 --> 767.3599999999999
they will

763.76 --> 769.68
but if you put pigs like in a

767.36 --> 771.92
in a barn or something

769.68 --> 774.399
and not so much that they can't maneuver

771.92 --> 777.1999999999999
anymore then they will naturally start

774.399 --> 781.2
to [ __ ] in one corner

777.2 --> 784.48
and then not hang around in that corner

781.2 --> 784.48
i bet you didn't know that

785.44 --> 791.519
i try to find other farm animals that do

788.399 --> 791.519
that not a lot do

794.8 --> 801.4799999999999
you grew up in a pig farm well did they

797.04 --> 801.48
have any maneuvering room whatsoever

801.6 --> 805.839
i've seen pig farms they're usually all

803.92 --> 809.04
crammed together so yeah what are you

805.839 --> 809.0400000000001
gonna do then you know

810.0 --> 813.76
if shit's all you you can roll in then

812.639 --> 816.16
yeah

813.76 --> 816.16
you know

819.199 --> 824.16
but i'll bet you if you just have pigs

821.519 --> 825.44
and you like open them up to like some

824.16 --> 827.36
grass field

825.44 --> 829.519
they're not there they might look up

827.36 --> 831.44
like puddles of mud

829.519 --> 833.76
but they're not gonna look like or

831.44 --> 836.72
they're not gonna look up a pile of [ __ ]

833.76 --> 836.72
and then roll in it

836.8 --> 840.7199999999999
correct

838.399 --> 844.24
peter harrington

840.72 --> 844.24
who grew up on a pig farm

850.88 --> 857.8389999999999
brain parasites that people got from

853.36 --> 857.839
pork was why it would what

864.079 --> 867.079
okay

870.32 --> 876.36
paddock and they will still

873.36 --> 876.36
okay

885.519 --> 890.5600000000001
look maybe there's like different types

887.6 --> 890.5600000000001
of pigs like that

892.639 --> 898.24
maybe some have like more dignity and

894.8 --> 900.4799999999999
consciousness than others

898.24 --> 903.199
i don't know

900.48 --> 904.399
but yeah i've never seen pigs like do

903.199 --> 906.56
that

904.399 --> 908.56
unless they were all crammed together

906.56 --> 910.88
and they were kind of depressed

908.56 --> 912.8
like if animals don't really know who

910.88 --> 915.199
they are anymore yeah they'll just do

912.8 --> 918.079
whatever

915.199 --> 921.3599999999999
right you got to realize that pigs are

918.079 --> 924.399
like very smart like they have high

921.36 --> 927.04
brain function in consciousness

924.399 --> 928.88
that means just like high brain function

927.04 --> 929.68
in consciousness that

928.88 --> 932.56
if

929.68 --> 935.12
you're not recognized for your

932.56 --> 938.88
intelligence you're gonna get depressed

935.12 --> 940.48
from it people that are depressed do

938.88 --> 942.0
gross things

940.48 --> 944.88
and depraved

942.0 --> 947.279
and they like depraved themselves

944.88 --> 949.199
right so i could argue from that route

947.279 --> 951.199
it doesn't say a lot of good about the

949.199 --> 954.199
pig farm you grew up in though peter

951.199 --> 954.199
harrington

969.04 --> 973.98
right so anyway

970.87 --> 973.98
[Music]

981.37 --> 984.419
[Music]

991.36 --> 996.0
right

993.36 --> 998.5600000000001
but yeah how many of you do even realize

996.0 --> 1001.279
that you can have pigs

998.56 --> 1001.279
as pets

1001.519 --> 1007.519
and they're like

1004.079 --> 1008.4799999999999
potentially as reliable as dogs

1007.519 --> 1011.04
yeah

1008.48 --> 1011.839
i'd like to see you try that with a goat

1011.04 --> 1014.88
right

1011.839 --> 1016.8000000000001
i mean nobody's gonna have a goat pet

1014.88 --> 1019.4399999999999
and then have them inside the house

1016.8 --> 1020.8
they're literally gonna trash the place

1019.44 --> 1023.12
well pigs

1020.8 --> 1025.839
don't

1023.12 --> 1027.52
and again pigs are very easily potty

1025.839 --> 1030.6399999999999
trained

1027.52 --> 1032.959
maybe even easier than dogs

1030.64 --> 1032.959
really

1033.28 --> 1039.12
i've known people that had pigs as pets

1035.52 --> 1040.319
and they were like

1039.12 --> 1043.039
smart

1040.319 --> 1043.039
and social

1044.079 --> 1048.72
i mean i think that pigs are even smart

1046.559 --> 1052.08
to a degree where they literally try to

1048.72 --> 1054.4
follow people's conversations sometimes

1052.08 --> 1056.72
i mean pigs might actually understand

1054.4 --> 1058.0
language to a degree

1056.72 --> 1061.76
some of them

1058.0 --> 1061.76
if they care enough right

1063.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
no that's wrong uh

1068.4 --> 1073.3200000000002
okay peter harrington sure

1080.799 --> 1084.24
what the hell borders boy

1084.88 --> 1089.48
the [ __ ] are you saying that for

1106.799 --> 1112.799
you watched for oh you watched more

1110.16 --> 1115.52
things getting tortured to death videos

1112.799 --> 1119.36
of course you did borders boy

1115.52 --> 1119.36
i know you like to do that [ __ ]

1119.52 --> 1122.52
gross

1142.0 --> 1145.52
people buy mini pigs for pets and they

1144.0 --> 1147.36
find out

1145.52 --> 1151.84
they grow huge

1147.36 --> 1151.84
well yeah they do grow pretty big

1152.0 --> 1157.039
eventually like

1154.4 --> 1158.0800000000002
yeah it all depends also on though like

1157.039 --> 1160.799
how much

1158.08 --> 1164.24
you're gonna feed them

1160.799 --> 1165.679
right i mean you could keep them kind of

1164.24 --> 1168.4
like

1165.679 --> 1170.64
not from bloating if you don't eat them

1168.4 --> 1173.919
a lot but here's the thing they will get

1170.64 --> 1177.44
like very hungry all the time and that

1173.919 --> 1180.0800000000002
might be a bit of a hazard so yeah

1177.44 --> 1181.76
a pig as a pet

1180.08 --> 1185.84
is not

1181.76 --> 1185.84
like it's not without problems

1186.96 --> 1191.28
like you have to realize you gotta have

1189.039 --> 1194.0
like a garden where you know eventually

1191.28 --> 1197.559
they'll just hang there

1194.0 --> 1197.559
a lot probably

1208.64 --> 1214.3200000000002
what the hell

1211.039 --> 1217.36
generally what the [ __ ]

1214.32 --> 1217.36
that's just gross

1219.36 --> 1224.3999999999999
i mean i can't believe you actually

1221.36 --> 1224.3999999999999
thought about that

1224.559 --> 1227.559
gross

1238.159 --> 1243.3200000000002
yeah flutter sage i'm kind of with you

1240.08 --> 1243.32
in a way

1251.6 --> 1258.7199999999998
yeah hey peter harrington yeah you may

1254.24 --> 1260.88
have grown up as you say on a pig farm

1258.72 --> 1263.52
that means you've dealt with pigs on

1260.88 --> 1265.8400000000001
your pig farm yeah

1263.52 --> 1268.08
that says more about

1265.84 --> 1270.559
your parents and how they kept their

1268.08 --> 1270.559
pigs

1270.88 --> 1273.8400000000001
right

1272.32 --> 1276.32
i think you're like

1273.84 --> 1278.9599999999998
maybe overblowing a bit like what you

1276.32 --> 1278.96
know about it

1279.28 --> 1285.6
i mean have you actually like studied

1281.679 --> 1285.6000000000001
pig pathology and all that

1285.84 --> 1291.4399999999998
because that doesn't automatically come

1289.28 --> 1293.44
as a bonus knowledge from growing up in

1291.44 --> 1296.72
a pig farm

1293.44 --> 1300.0
right you just get to deal with the pigs

1296.72 --> 1303.1200000000001
in the farm and their psychology

1300.0 --> 1307.52
so yeah i guess that the pigs that on

1303.12 --> 1311.039
your pig farm roll in their own [ __ ]

1307.52 --> 1315.1589999999999
that tells me personally more

1311.039 --> 1315.1589999999999
about your pig farm

1326.48 --> 1331.2
they used to put pigs on trial in may

1329.52 --> 1333.04
what the hell marks out where the hell

1331.2 --> 1338.68
are you getting that phone

1333.04 --> 1338.68
[Music]

1338.96 --> 1342.159
what

1339.53 --> 1343.6789999999999
[Music]

1342.159 --> 1344.96
on trial

1343.679 --> 1349.039
mark stout

1344.96 --> 1349.919
do you have any actual reference of that

1349.039 --> 1352.1589999999999
that's

1349.919 --> 1354.5590000000002
that sounds like a crazy fairy tale

1352.159 --> 1354.5590000000002
story

1355.039 --> 1358.8799999999999
why would you put a pig on trial

1359.12 --> 1364.32
well unless they used to be humans

1364.4 --> 1368.24
i mean maybe

1366.64 --> 1370.7990000000002
there was still a period where it was

1368.24 --> 1373.039
known like okay pigs transformed from

1370.799 --> 1374.48
humans into pigs through this weird

1373.039 --> 1376.559
genetic [ __ ]

1374.48 --> 1379.28
or they chose it

1376.559 --> 1381.52
and then there's pigs and like yeah

1379.28 --> 1383.6789999999999
people still had some memory like yeah

1381.52 --> 1386.4
they were used to be humans okay we've

1383.679 --> 1387.76
got to give them like human rights maybe

1386.4 --> 1390.72
for a bit

1387.76 --> 1393.28
until it just like turns out that

1390.72 --> 1394.4
they just become animals some of them

1393.28 --> 1396.96
and then

1394.4 --> 1398.96
they're probably like okay maybe we

1396.96 --> 1400.96
shouldn't actually treat them like

1398.96 --> 1405.44
humans because they're not humans

1400.96 --> 1408.76
anymore they're just this pig thing

1405.44 --> 1408.76
i don't know

1416.92 --> 1420.049
[Music]

1422.24 --> 1427.52
a pig killed a child in the town

1425.12 --> 1430.4799999999998
what more justice than killing it on the

1427.52 --> 1433.039
spot

1430.48 --> 1433.039
okay

1435.679 --> 1439.76
well that just

1437.12 --> 1441.9189999999999
if the way you describe that mark stout

1439.76 --> 1445.039
sounds more like

1441.919 --> 1447.44
those medieval people were just like

1445.039 --> 1447.44
really

1449.12 --> 1454.1589999999999
stressed out

1450.48 --> 1456.559
they were probably getting too cramped

1454.159 --> 1459.279
by their lords

1456.559 --> 1461.84
and so they were just like starving and

1459.279 --> 1464.4
just constantly looking for something to

1461.84 --> 1468.48
have vengeance on right because they

1464.4 --> 1470.64
couldn't do anything about their slavery

1468.48 --> 1472.4
that would make sense then that oh a pig

1470.64 --> 1475.279
just kills a

1472.4 --> 1477.279
a kid or something

1475.279 --> 1480.08
and then it's like oh we're gonna put

1477.279 --> 1483.6
him under trial just like if he were the

1480.08 --> 1486.48
lord right so they're just projecting

1483.6 --> 1488.6399999999999
their hunger for vengeance

1486.48 --> 1491.279
against their slave master onto the

1488.64 --> 1494.5200000000002
animal in that situation it sounds more

1491.279 --> 1494.52
like that

1508.4 --> 1513.96
i think i'm getting flooded by numpties

1510.96 --> 1513.96
here

1521.12 --> 1526.1589999999999
because they were ignorant medieval

1524.24 --> 1528.64
people yeah that just sounds like horror

1526.159 --> 1531.2
[ __ ]

1528.64 --> 1532.96
ignorant medieval people what the [ __ ]

1531.2 --> 1534.72
are you how do you know they were

1532.96 --> 1536.72
ignorant how do you know what they even

1534.72 --> 1537.76
knew how do you know what they went

1536.72 --> 1538.72
through

1537.76 --> 1541.279
like

1538.72 --> 1544.559
if you were under like

1541.279 --> 1546.88
just imagine these [ __ ] freaks on top

1544.559 --> 1548.08
right now here in this world in this

1546.88 --> 1549.679
time yeah

1548.08 --> 1551.6
how nasty they are and they're

1549.679 --> 1554.3200000000002
constantly trying to manipulate drive

1551.6 --> 1558.48
everybody crazy drive people to suicide

1554.32 --> 1559.6
now imagine that mindset of those people

1558.48 --> 1564.24
back then

1559.6 --> 1566.7199999999998
having full authority to just on a whim

1564.24 --> 1569.2
have somebody executed right in front of

1566.72 --> 1571.3600000000001
them because they felt like it

1569.2 --> 1574.0
and they had the right and nobody would

1571.36 --> 1575.6789999999999
be able to stop them except by just mobs

1574.0 --> 1576.64
or just

1575.679 --> 1578.64
just

1576.64 --> 1580.5590000000002
everybody just deciding in the spot like

1578.64 --> 1582.96
that person is gonna die no matter what

1580.559 --> 1584.559
happens even if we all die afterward

1582.96 --> 1586.48
right

1584.559 --> 1589.279
yeah

1586.48 --> 1591.3600000000001
you you think you would stay sane

1589.279 --> 1593.919
in a time like that

1591.36 --> 1595.6
i wouldn't

1593.919 --> 1597.679
i'd be a freaking

1595.6 --> 1600.1589999999999
foaming at the mouth robin hood guy

1597.679 --> 1602.72
probably got would be get getting killed

1600.159 --> 1605.679
very young

1602.72 --> 1605.679
in a time like that

1606.32 --> 1610.0
okay

1607.76 --> 1612.4
so don't just call

1610.0 --> 1614.6
medieval people ignorant because some

1612.4 --> 1617.679
stupid freemason

1614.6 --> 1619.6789999999999
pre-programming [ __ ] is standardized

1617.679 --> 1620.64
and rolled out in front of you

1619.679 --> 1622.4
yeah

1620.64 --> 1625.5200000000002
you try to imagine what it would have

1622.4 --> 1628.0800000000002
been like in that time and not all

1625.52 --> 1630.4
everybody's so dumb they didn't know any

1628.08 --> 1632.72
better no how about

1630.4 --> 1634.24
severely punishing psychological

1632.72 --> 1636.96
circumstances

1634.24 --> 1637.919
food deprivation

1636.96 --> 1641.279
and

1637.919 --> 1643.44
like still trying to hold up very old

1641.279 --> 1645.2
knowledge that's kind of become occulted

1643.44 --> 1647.1200000000001
because of the powers that just didn't

1645.2 --> 1648.559
want you to have anything not even

1647.12 --> 1649.6
knowledge

1648.559 --> 1651.44
yeah

1649.6 --> 1656.8799999999999
they weren't dumb

1651.44 --> 1656.88
they were just under heavy pressure and

1657.279 --> 1659.52
like

1660.799 --> 1665.2
things that i can't even imagine

1662.96 --> 1665.2
like

1667.6 --> 1671.36
turmoil like

1669.36 --> 1674.32
societal like

1671.36 --> 1676.8799999999999
perspective like what is all this how

1674.32 --> 1677.84
what is it to be human

1676.88 --> 1679.8400000000001
right

1677.84 --> 1681.36
it's been many transitions throughout

1679.84 --> 1684.6399999999999
history

1681.36 --> 1684.6399999999999
of how people live

1685.12 --> 1689.12
and every time it happens

1687.12 --> 1691.52
whether for good or for bad people then

1689.12 --> 1693.4399999999998
have to adapt and like reorient

1691.52 --> 1695.12
themselves socially and in their own

1693.44 --> 1698.72
identities

1695.12 --> 1698.7199999999998
it's difficult that's tough

1698.96 --> 1702.24
so

1699.84 --> 1702.24
anyway

1705.84 --> 1709.6
didn't say they were dumb just ignorant

1707.6 --> 1710.559
yeah but how do you know ignorant of

1709.6 --> 1713.12
what

1710.559 --> 1716.32
mark stout ignorant of what

1713.12 --> 1716.32
what did they ignore

1716.64 --> 1722.1200000000001
what knowledge that was available did

1718.88 --> 1722.1200000000001
they ignore

1733.12 --> 1739.3899999999999
okay very funny

1736.22 --> 1739.39
[Music]

1765.279 --> 1770.24
i would put a pig on trial in the 21st

1767.84 --> 1773.12
century that's a good one

1770.24 --> 1776.159
well what if a person

1773.12 --> 1778.08
actually identifies as a pig

1776.159 --> 1781.8400000000001
oink oink

1778.08 --> 1781.84
and they commit a crime

1789.279 --> 1793.52
i think that

1790.559 --> 1795.44
like in a liberal court

1793.52 --> 1798.0
you could definitely

1795.44 --> 1800.3200000000002
identify as a pig and they would mark

1798.0 --> 1803.919
you up as a pig

1800.32 --> 1803.9189999999999
being on trial yeah

1804.48 --> 1811.88
i think that can technically happen it's

1806.559 --> 1811.8799999999999
not even that outrageous in my mind so

1827.84 --> 1834.1589999999999
that's i'm getting all weird with this

1830.0 --> 1834.159
so yeah 21st century

1834.24 --> 1840.559
a person identifying as a pig

1837.76 --> 1842.1589999999999
kills a kid

1840.559 --> 1843.44
arguably

1842.159 --> 1846.159
through like

1843.44 --> 1847.8400000000001
post birth abortion and then oh is it

1846.159 --> 1850.5590000000002
legal is it not yeah

1847.84 --> 1852.08
like that scenario can literally be

1850.559 --> 1857.039
placed

1852.08 --> 1857.039
on the times and it actually fits

1859.279 --> 1863.799
people identifying as animals

1864.24 --> 1867.279
doing that yeah

1871.919 --> 1877.7990000000002
hey len linux all right too busy that's

1874.799 --> 1877.799
fine

1886.799 --> 1890.799
yeah marx doubt the court act might

1889.2 --> 1893.8400000000001
actually treat them

1890.799 --> 1893.84
as a pig

1894.399 --> 1897.279
right if they're

1895.919 --> 1900.3200000000002
liberal

1897.279 --> 1903.32
and all trans compatible and all that

1900.32 --> 1903.32
yeah

1908.64 --> 1914.519
pronoun oink or whatever you know

1921.76 --> 1927.279
that sounds like a fantasy to me oh yeah

1924.32 --> 1930.32
no [ __ ] sherlock welcome to the real

1927.279 --> 1933.44
world this is a real world where that

1930.32 --> 1936.24
sort of fantasy retardation actually

1933.44 --> 1936.24
happens now

1936.32 --> 1941.12
yeah i know it's fancy that that's not

1938.48 --> 1945.159
gonna prevent it from actually being

1941.12 --> 1945.1589999999999
real or possible

1952.48 --> 1956.3600000000001
oink is a slurp

1974.08 --> 1978.24
now court will treat them as such in

1975.919 --> 1979.44
illegal yeah but that

1978.24 --> 1982.0
now of course

1979.44 --> 1984.3200000000002
but they might still be like addressed

1982.0 --> 1986.399
as a pig and all that

1984.32 --> 1987.6
they're still gonna be tried as a person

1986.399 --> 1988.84
of course

1987.6 --> 1992.24
but right

1988.84 --> 1995.519
like if a pig had full sentience in

1992.24 --> 1998.3990000000001
human intelligence and verbal capacity

1995.519 --> 2002.48
then i think that it that such a pig if

1998.399 --> 2005.4399999999998
they were actually the animal pig yeah

2002.48 --> 2008.159
they would probably with some hassle be

2005.44 --> 2009.039
recognized as a person too in court

2008.159 --> 2011.8400000000001
right

2009.039 --> 2014.48
because a court it's about

2011.84 --> 2017.12
accountability about your actions and

2014.48 --> 2019.679
all those it's not so much about what

2017.12 --> 2022.1589999999999
type of genetic thing you are

2019.679 --> 2025.039
it's about your intelligence and your

2022.159 --> 2026.5590000000002
communication and your actions

2025.039 --> 2028.559
right so

2026.559 --> 2030.0
i'm getting very weird and technical

2028.559 --> 2033.559
here but yeah

2030.0 --> 2033.559
he's gonna squeal

2034.32 --> 2037.4399999999998
oh this is great

2038.88 --> 2043.3990000000001
i love this subject it's hilarious

2043.55 --> 2046.6599999999999
[Music]

2050.399 --> 2056.3289999999997
uh

2053.19 --> 2056.329
[Music]

2064.159 --> 2069.8
is this a pig roast no actually the

2066.8 --> 2069.8
opposite

2078.72 --> 2082.9599999999996
oh talking about which

2081.2 --> 2085.919
ass stock accounts not going to mention

2082.96 --> 2085.919
that but

2086.0 --> 2091.919
there might still be people

2088.72 --> 2094.6389999999997
big hybrids offspring there might be

2091.919 --> 2096.7999999999997
people out there that have

2094.639 --> 2098.8
remnants of these pig

2096.8 --> 2101.44
transformation

2098.8 --> 2103.04
genetics with them right

2101.44 --> 2105.76
because

2103.04 --> 2109.119
if people at some point were enchanted

2105.76 --> 2111.44
to become a species that is pig

2109.119 --> 2113.52
well maybe they went halfway

2111.44 --> 2116.079
maybe had just slightly

2113.52 --> 2117.92
right partial transformation

2116.079 --> 2120.7200000000003
and they could have still procreated

2117.92 --> 2122.4
with humans so there might be some pig

2120.72 --> 2125.1189999999997
remnants

2122.4 --> 2126.0
in certain bloodlines

2125.119 --> 2128.6400000000003
right

2126.0 --> 2131.359
i think that ranty is one of those

2128.64 --> 2133.44
people that has a pretty high percentage

2131.359 --> 2135.52
of pig genetics

2133.44 --> 2138.2400000000002
passed on

2135.52 --> 2140.4
and yeah you it kind of looks like it he

2138.24 --> 2143.2
acts like it

2140.4 --> 2147.6800000000003
you know he stinks

2143.2 --> 2149.1189999999997
yeah i mean i don't have to guess that

2147.68 --> 2152.96
and

2149.119 --> 2155.2000000000003
he it take me so god i'm annoyed

2152.96 --> 2157.359
and as he's like growing up he's like

2155.2 --> 2161.52
fattening up like a pig too before you

2157.359 --> 2162.7999999999997
know it granty is only just gonna lie

2161.52 --> 2164.079
somewhere

2162.8 --> 2167.119
in the dirt

2164.079 --> 2167.119
all day long just

2169.119 --> 2174.48
and that's what he's gonna be doing the

2170.64 --> 2174.48
rest of the days you know that

2177.839 --> 2182.4
there was a pigment on the seinfeld tv

2180.16 --> 2182.3999999999996
show

2182.8 --> 2186.28
i'm not surprised

2187.44 --> 2193.52
i think there's going to be multiple

2190.16 --> 2196.16
people associating with jews that are

2193.52 --> 2197.28
probably gonna have some weird fantasies

2196.16 --> 2200.3199999999997
about that

2197.28 --> 2204.52
so it doesn't surprise me at all that

2200.32 --> 2204.52
there was a pigment on seinfeld

2232.96 --> 2235.76
hey andrew

2240.0 --> 2244.4
you had to down tool to give runty [ __ ]

2244.64 --> 2247.8799999999997
that's hilarious

2287.359 --> 2290.48
right anyway

2291.44 --> 2295.04
eggs

2293.52 --> 2296.84
they might have been humans at some

2295.04 --> 2299.44
point

2296.84 --> 2301.839
[Music]

2299.44 --> 2304.839
they're smarter than people take for

2301.839 --> 2304.839
granted

2338.8 --> 2341.8
um

2364.4 --> 2366.56
hmm

2365.28 --> 2369.119
okay

2366.56 --> 2372.16
weird [ __ ] going on in the

2369.119 --> 2372.1600000000003
skype chat here

2374.24 --> 2378.3999999999996
this might turn into a very interesting

2376.64 --> 2382.48
fed

2378.4 --> 2384.8
or very rowdy fvd we'll see

2382.48 --> 2384.8
anyway

2388.96 --> 2391.96
right

2420.319 --> 2425.44
oh

2422.319 --> 2427.7599999999998
a horse ranch that has a zebra

2425.44 --> 2427.76
huh

2434.96 --> 2439.44
i always wondered by the way with zebras

2437.52 --> 2441.92
if they are

2439.44 --> 2445.119
trainable like horses

2441.92 --> 2448.079
or are they just too difficult

2445.119 --> 2448.079
i have no idea

2449.28 --> 2456.2400000000002
because i mean

2451.04 --> 2456.24
zebras are very similar to horses

2464.319 --> 2470.48
but i've never ever seen anybody like

2467.44 --> 2472.48
ride a zebra

2470.48 --> 2476.76
they might be just too wild for that or

2472.48 --> 2476.76
something does anybody know

2486.64 --> 2491.04
a lot of work painting them stripes oh

2493.68 --> 2498.3999999999996
they god weaker spines do they

2496.079 --> 2498.4
huh

2499.839 --> 2504.56
that's weird

2502.4 --> 2506.8
by the way i bet that that part is

2504.56 --> 2508.48
actually adaptation

2506.8 --> 2511.599
right

2508.48 --> 2513.119
i mean horses are specifically used to

2511.599 --> 2516.56
carry that weight

2513.119 --> 2518.56
so horses would be

2516.56 --> 2521.7599999999998
bred

2518.56 --> 2523.2
to have strong spines so they would not

2521.76 --> 2525.3590000000004
be able to be

2523.2 --> 2527.4399999999996
ideal riding

2525.359 --> 2529.359
animals right well

2527.44 --> 2531.92
you could do the same

2529.359 --> 2534.4
with zebras you could literally take a

2531.92 --> 2537.04
bunch and then start breeding them on

2534.4 --> 2538.2400000000002
getting stronger spines

2537.04 --> 2540.319
right

2538.24 --> 2542.7999999999997
and then that way yeah you can turn

2540.319 --> 2546.4
zebra into riding animals

2542.8 --> 2546.4
over a couple of generations

2548.839 --> 2554.48
potentially huh but i've never seen

2551.52 --> 2556.319
anybody ride a zebra though

2554.48 --> 2558.88
like i've just never seen that like even

2556.319 --> 2560.8
on footage and i am like a horseback

2558.88 --> 2565.319
rider so

2560.8 --> 2565.319
i pay attention to that sort of thing

2572.0 --> 2577.72
it could have been a painted horse

2574.72 --> 2577.72
right

2587.839 --> 2591.599
zebras can be domestically trained but

2589.839 --> 2593.44
it's cruel well

2591.599 --> 2596.8
technically so

2593.44 --> 2598.8
the same goes with horses right except

2596.8 --> 2601.52
it's already happened for

2598.8 --> 2603.44
a long long time with horses so

2601.52 --> 2605.68
they're already domesticated but yeah

2603.44 --> 2609.28
any wild animal

2605.68 --> 2611.1189999999997
domesticating them usually

2609.28 --> 2613.76
yeah cruelty does

2611.119 --> 2617.599
come into play you're literally breaking

2613.76 --> 2617.599
their will away from the wild

2618.64 --> 2624.04
i don't see how you can do that without

2620.48 --> 2624.04
some kind of cruelty

2642.56 --> 2647.72
hey by the way hello dank good to see

2644.56 --> 2647.72
you there

2656.16 --> 2659.16
hmm

2665.28 --> 2671.2000000000003
okay mateo so there was a zoo that had a

2668.0 --> 2674.0
zebra that they trained to have little

2671.2 --> 2674.0
kids right him

2674.16 --> 2681.16
sounds exciting

2676.88 --> 2681.1600000000003
as a kid i would have loved that

2701.04 --> 2705.92
a large island the middle of

2704.16 --> 2708.0
lake

2705.92 --> 2710.96
okay

2708.0 --> 2713.76
72 million geez

2710.96 --> 2716.96
i mean amazing and all that but

2713.76 --> 2716.96
how big is the island

2717.119 --> 2721.28
like

2719.44 --> 2723.599
how's the water level throughout the

2721.28 --> 2723.599
year

2725.44 --> 2731.319
does it rise and

2727.599 --> 2731.319
at times or something

2739.2 --> 2745.9089999999997
anyway

2741.85 --> 2745.909
[Music]

2763.52 --> 2768.16
okay matthew hall

2765.599 --> 2768.88
they do races really but with people on

2768.16 --> 2771.2799999999997
them

2768.88 --> 2774.2400000000002
i've never seen that though

2771.28 --> 2776.4
i mean they are like horses so yeah in a

2774.24 --> 2779.359
flock they will

2776.4 --> 2781.28
race just like horses but

2779.359 --> 2783.7599999999998
you don't necessarily need an extra

2781.28 --> 2787.1600000000003
strong spine for that

2783.76 --> 2787.1600000000003
but anyway

2807.68 --> 2810.0
hmm

2811.68 --> 2817.839
numbers are dwindling

2814.0 --> 2817.839
what how is that happening

2835.99 --> 2839.16
[Music]

2854.88 --> 2860.0
i mean the only reason i could think of

2856.72 --> 2861.2
pgcnet why zebras zebra numbers would be

2860.0 --> 2863.76
dwindling

2861.2 --> 2866.3999999999996
is because there would be a surplus of

2863.76 --> 2868.0
lions and hyenas

2866.4 --> 2869.359
right

2868.0 --> 2871.76
if they're like

2869.359 --> 2872.96
too many of those then zebras might

2871.76 --> 2875.28
start to

2872.96 --> 2878.28
get dwindling numbers you know what i

2875.28 --> 2878.28
mean

2889.359 --> 2895.2
competition with livestock why how are

2892.24 --> 2898.7599999999998
you mean competition poaching

2895.2 --> 2898.7599999999998
what why

2912.72 --> 2915.839
oh wow

2922.96 --> 2926.079
oh yeah

2927.359 --> 2932.16
yeah seeking star wars the links it

2929.68 --> 2935.9199999999996
tells me it's already sold

2932.16 --> 2935.92
it looks pretty amazing by the way

2942.079 --> 2944.4
yeah

2944.72 --> 2948.04
pretty awesome

2968.0 --> 2972.0
i have canine effect that's weird

2970.079 --> 2974.1600000000003
matthew i didn't know that so

2972.0 --> 2975.76
zebras have very different type of teeth

2974.16 --> 2978.3999999999996
from horses

2975.76 --> 2981.96
that's odd

2978.4 --> 2981.96
i had no idea

2995.04 --> 2999.839
and another weird quest can you

2997.44 --> 2999.839
like do

3000.88 --> 3008.48
zebras crossbreed with horses at all

3005.28 --> 3010.079
i mean horses crossbreed with with

3008.48 --> 3011.76
donkeys right

3010.079 --> 3013.52
and those make mules

3011.76 --> 3015.92
does something like is that something

3013.52 --> 3017.52
like that possible with zebras too or

3015.92 --> 3019.52
are they completely

3017.52 --> 3022.92
genetically incompatible or something i

3019.52 --> 3022.92
have no idea

3056.0 --> 3059.0
hmm

3070.0 --> 3075.68
all right hey steamy traveler yeah so

3072.48 --> 3078.2400000000002
there is a crossovers okay

3075.68 --> 3080.72
what do they look like

3078.24 --> 3083.839
oh well if they existed i could probably

3080.72 --> 3083.839
just google it

3090.4 --> 3093.119
oh [ __ ]

3095.04 --> 3098.4
wow

3096.4 --> 3102.4
yeah they do exist and

3098.4 --> 3104.4
that looks really surreal man

3102.4 --> 3106.7200000000003
wow

3104.4 --> 3108.48
that's weird

3106.72 --> 3112.319
it's kind of cool

3108.48 --> 3112.319
and surreal but weird

3113.599 --> 3118.7200000000003
yeah i think i'm gonna present that

3116.319 --> 3122.44
zorse

3118.72 --> 3122.4399999999996
that's the thing apparently

3139.68 --> 3142.0
right

3148.48 --> 3153.52
wow those

3150.079 --> 3155.44
those like pure white and dance at least

3153.52 --> 3158.64
that's

3155.44 --> 3158.64
totally surreal

3159.44 --> 3166.0
like that's really that's

3161.76 --> 3168.7200000000003
amazing that looks really amazing

3166.0 --> 3168.72
and trippy

3176.72 --> 3179.72
cool

3204.8 --> 3207.8390000000004
um

3205.92 --> 3210.559
right they are infertile right so just

3207.839 --> 3213.04
like mules see me traveler because mules

3210.559 --> 3216.3190000000004
have the same effect

3213.04 --> 3220.319
crossover between donkey and horses

3216.319 --> 3222.8
they're like super weight carriers

3220.319 --> 3223.68
and they have extreme stamina but they

3222.8 --> 3226.48
are

3223.68 --> 3226.48
infertile

3226.88 --> 3230.0
i think

3228.0 --> 3231.92
most like i don't know if it's always

3230.0 --> 3236.04
but most of the time at least i don't

3231.92 --> 3236.04
know don't remember exactly

3237.359 --> 3241.119
look at them painting yours no they're

3239.599 --> 3244.76
not painted

3241.119 --> 3244.76
that's not painted

3260.8 --> 3265.8390000000004
another hoax

3262.24 --> 3265.839
yeah i don't know rufus

3269.839 --> 3273.92
i don't think so

3271.52 --> 3275.92
ah what's that

3273.92 --> 3278.64
steven traveler

3275.92 --> 3280.96
zonkeys

3278.64 --> 3280.96
oh

3281.04 --> 3287.72
so these are zebra donkey crossover

3283.92 --> 3287.7200000000003
specific huh

3301.28 --> 3307.28
yeah ligers also and ligers are really

3304.24 --> 3310.4799999999996
special because they don't stop growing

3307.28 --> 3313.8390000000004
which is really bizarre

3310.48 --> 3313.839
they have basically like

3314.96 --> 3320.559
the ancient giant growth thing

3318.319 --> 3324.48
just like some lizards do that just

3320.559 --> 3324.48
never stop growing what's crocodile

3325.76 --> 3328.7990000000004
well crocodile is a lizard type

3327.599 --> 3330.88
technically

3328.799 --> 3333.24
but they never stop growing

3330.88 --> 3335.28
over time they just keep growing

3333.24 --> 3338.2099999999996
[Music]

3335.28 --> 3339.52
ligers do that too half tiger half lion

3338.21 --> 3342.2400000000002
[Music]

3339.52 --> 3344.16
so they can just become massive but

3342.24 --> 3346.64
eventually they will just buckle under

3344.16 --> 3349.08
their own weight

3346.64 --> 3350.8799999999997
right

3349.08 --> 3352.799
[Music]

3350.88 --> 3355.44
i suspect that the

3352.799 --> 3359.2
the giants

3355.44 --> 3362.7200000000003
the 20 meter tall humans in the past

3359.2 --> 3365.68
had that same effect that they didn't

3362.72 --> 3367.2
like get born like a huge baby or

3365.68 --> 3369.5989999999997
something but they'd started out

3367.2 --> 3371.2799999999997
relatively normal human size and then

3369.599 --> 3372.96
just keep growing and growing and

3371.28 --> 3375.52
growing and growing and growing and

3372.96 --> 3378.64
growing over the lifetime

3375.52 --> 3380.319
now they had the the pyramid

3378.64 --> 3382.64
electric energy

3380.319 --> 3385.2799999999997
to sustain themselves and prevent them

3382.64 --> 3388.92
from buckling under their own weight

3385.28 --> 3388.92
and under hunger

3390.16 --> 3395.1189999999997
and hey maybe that would work for liars

3392.24 --> 3398.0789999999997
right if we had an active functioning

3395.119 --> 3400.319
pyramid energy field i bet a liger could

3398.079 --> 3401.44
like become

3400.319 --> 3404.88
huge

3401.44 --> 3406.799
like as big as an elephant perhaps

3404.88 --> 3408.799
before it would crumble under its own

3406.799 --> 3411.04
way eventually it is going to do that

3408.799 --> 3411.04
but

3411.839 --> 3417.4
can you imagine a liger as big as an

3414.4 --> 3417.4
elephant

3420.16 --> 3424.5589999999997
that's by the way that would be kind of

3422.0 --> 3426.559
dangerous although being that big it's

3424.559 --> 3427.6800000000003
not going to be fast right the bigger

3426.559 --> 3430.2400000000002
they are

3427.68 --> 3432.64
the slower they get because becoming

3430.24 --> 3435.1189999999997
faster at that size

3432.64 --> 3437.68
basically starts meaning that your speed

3435.119 --> 3440.88
is literally going to destroy your body

3437.68 --> 3442.8799999999997
that's why the biggest animals are slow

3440.88 --> 3446.799
because quickness

3442.88 --> 3448.96
takes its toll when you're large

3446.799 --> 3452.0
right and that's why very small animals

3448.96 --> 3454.16
like mice can be just insanely fast

3452.0 --> 3455.76
without any consequence

3454.16 --> 3459.799
because they don't have all that weight

3455.76 --> 3459.7990000000004
so they can be that fast

3484.64 --> 3489.24
no george no it's not

3491.44 --> 3498.799
it's not painted

3494.16 --> 3501.52
painted horses look different

3498.799 --> 3504.079
can't paint them like that not with that

3501.52 --> 3505.92
distinct pattern

3504.079 --> 3508.0
it doesn't work that way

3505.92 --> 3510.319
it's gonna be visible that it's painted

3508.0 --> 3512.16
on and not

3510.319 --> 3514.799
from the skin up

3512.16 --> 3517.7599999999998
hair color you're gonna see that

3514.799 --> 3518.559
yeah

3517.76 --> 3520.559
not

3518.559 --> 3521.6800000000003
like there's just horses that look like

3520.559 --> 3524.6800000000003
that

3521.68 --> 3524.68
period

3551.04 --> 3556.0
hey rick back good to see you ah

3554.48 --> 3559.559
oh house here

3556.0 --> 3559.559

share the show

3577.28 --> 3581.2000000000003
i don't know if it's actually 32 it

3579.04 --> 3584.4
might be keep it yeah it might be a

3581.2 --> 3586.16
number stuck to that

3584.4 --> 3588.48
doesn't mean there's so much activity in

3586.16 --> 3588.48
chat

3594.88 --> 3597.6800000000003
thank you matthew

3599.359 --> 3604.96

3649.76 --> 3655.28
what

3652.0 --> 3659.2
rick beck really he did that oh my god

3655.28 --> 3659.2000000000003
that's so pathetic

3660.0 --> 3664.64
pathetic

3662.079 --> 3666.0
bob you're so

3664.64 --> 3668.48
[ __ ]

3666.0 --> 3670.4
pathetic

3668.48 --> 3671.76
so petty so

3670.4 --> 3674.0
sad

3671.76 --> 3675.5200000000004
that you're still doing that

3674.0 --> 3677.68
i mean

3675.52 --> 3679.119
it's not gonna work

3677.68 --> 3682.48
[Music]

3679.119 --> 3684.48
you understand it's not gonna work bob

3682.48 --> 3686.559
nodell it's not

3684.48 --> 3689.76
going to work

3686.559 --> 3692.88
scientific method is very rigid very

3689.76 --> 3695.0400000000004
strict for a very good reason and i know

3692.88 --> 3698.52
you love to speculate about things that

3695.04 --> 3698.52
you can't prove

3698.64 --> 3702.8799999999997
through inference and all that it's

3700.48 --> 3705.44
great i like to do that myself a bit

3702.88 --> 3709.2000000000003
right except i'm very clear about when i

3705.44 --> 3709.2000000000003
do that and when i don't

3709.52 --> 3714.799
stop

3710.839 --> 3719.68
attacking fundamental knowledge

3714.799 --> 3722.0
bob nodell it's really [ __ ] up

3719.68 --> 3724.839
only place it's gonna maneuver you

3722.0 --> 3730.0
towards is more

3724.839 --> 3731.839
hell more suspense of disbelief about

3730.0 --> 3734.0
who you are

3731.839 --> 3736.88
and what we're all supposed to do here

3734.0 --> 3737.92
it's stupid

3736.88 --> 3741.28
yeah

3737.92 --> 3743.76
nathan's not gonna stop criticizing you

3741.28 --> 3746.3190000000004
for your flawed approaches and

3743.76 --> 3750.6400000000003
especially your ether belief

3746.319 --> 3752.079
your hypocrisy your social hypocrisy

3750.64 --> 3754.8799999999997
amazing

3752.079 --> 3758.48
amazing in your face social hypocrisy

3754.88 --> 3759.599
about the way you conduct yourself

3758.48 --> 3761.92
yeah

3759.599 --> 3764.799
it's not gonna stop

3761.92 --> 3768.48
and taking a position of like

3764.799 --> 3771.839
nathan doesn't understand science it

3768.48 --> 3774.799
just makes everybody want to slap you

3771.839 --> 3777.599
hit you in the face you dumb [ __ ]

3774.799 --> 3780.16
stop doing that it doesn't work it just

3777.599 --> 3781.3590000000004
makes you more petty

3780.16 --> 3783.839
and more

3781.359 --> 3785.119
repulsive

3783.839 --> 3786.88
yeah

if you're gonna attack nathan then

3786.88 --> 3790.7200000000003
attack him on something that's actually

3789.039 --> 3792.7200000000003
a flaw

and he does have him you know and he'll

3792.72 --> 3796.3999999999996
welcome them

3794.0 --> 3798.88
he'll do that right if you're gonna

3796.4 --> 3802.0
attack the scientific method and say

3798.88 --> 3804.1600000000003
they don't understand no dumb [ __ ]

3802.0 --> 3807.359

3804.16 --> 3810.8799999999997
not willing to understand

3807.359 --> 3813.119
doubling down on your pseudo science

3810.88 --> 3816.0
convictions

3813.119 --> 3818.7200000000003
it's not helping it's not helping flat

3893.44 --> 3898.88
claims to master if you don't agree with

3896.559 --> 3900.559
that he attacks you politically like a

3898.88 --> 3903.839
democrat yeah

3900.559 --> 3905.3590000000004
like a neo-liberal democrat he bob

3922.96 --> 3928.799
word like a [ __ ] political agent

3926.799 --> 3932.799
you scumbag

3928.799 --> 3935.2
you banned me for years from people

3932.799 --> 3938.319
from people's channel where you don't

3935.2 --> 3941.7599999999998
even hang around regularly okay you

3938.319 --> 3941.7599999999998
don't even hang around there

3943.92 --> 3948.96
i just want to have some random comments

3946.4 --> 3951.44
i want questions right because i want to

3948.96 --> 3955.599
get to the bottom of things and

3951.44 --> 3958.4
my findings are for everybody including

3955.599 --> 3962.1600000000003
you including jaron including everybody

3958.4 --> 3963.44
right when i go to jim bob's chat

3962.16 --> 3966.72
i

3963.44 --> 3968.16
free to completely throw down whatever i

3966.72 --> 3971.5989999999997
want

3968.16 --> 3973.52
and even seek out a bit of like fringe

3971.599 --> 3976.4
territory

3973.52 --> 3979.839
get a little wonky weird sometimes and

3976.4 --> 3982.799
getting super on point inspired and like

3979.839 --> 3984.0
theological inspired i go in all

3982.799 --> 3985.119
directions

3984.0 --> 3988.4
why

3985.119 --> 3991.039
because it's accepted and everybody can

3988.4 --> 3993.119
take from what i do there like

3991.039 --> 3995.92
i know jim bob's reading my messages

3993.119 --> 3998.4
when i do that because it stands out i

3995.92 --> 4000.4
know it does he doesn't have to name my

3998.4 --> 4003.52
name

4000.4 --> 4007.039
it's there it's there for everybody to

4003.52 --> 4010.079
assimilate copy use as inspiration as a

4007.039 --> 4012.0
template or a grander thought or an

4010.079 --> 4013.6800000000003
another train of thought in a different

4012.0 --> 4016.079
direction it's

4013.68 --> 4019.359
all for everybody yeah

4016.079 --> 4022.88
i can't do that if so if i'm banned

4019.359 --> 4026.0
because some political [ __ ]

4022.88 --> 4029.92
chooses to censor me

4026.0 --> 4032.839
in places that he thinks is theirs like

4029.92 --> 4036.2400000000002
bob thinks he owns

4032.839 --> 4038.319
people and then he bans his political

4036.24 --> 4039.9199999999996
opponents

4038.319 --> 4042.64
that's what he does

4039.92 --> 4046.4
i hate him for that yeah i find him

4042.64 --> 4049.52
annoying a weenie a gamma [ __ ] a lot of

4046.4 --> 4051.76
the times but that's okay because

4049.52 --> 4054.0
there's a lot of them out there flat

4051.76 --> 4056.1600000000003
earthers and ballers

4054.0 --> 4058.559
that's okay that's that's a natural

4056.16 --> 4060.319
hazard it's an occupational hazard what

4058.559 --> 4062.559
i don't

4060.319 --> 4066.64
accept however is that

4062.559 --> 4070.4
people just censor others purely

4066.64 --> 4073.0389999999998
because they are in opposition

4070.4 --> 4075.52
to your ideas

4073.039 --> 4077.2000000000003
that's where it becomes like political

4075.52 --> 4078.88
censorship

4077.2 --> 4081.5989999999997
that's evil

4078.88 --> 4083.92
that's actual censorship yeah that's not

4081.599 --> 4085.52
oh he went too far

4083.92 --> 4088.16
he got a little rough put him in a

4085.52 --> 4090.0
timeout i get that yeah

4088.16 --> 4091.839
of course there's if you're going to

4090.0 --> 4093.68
accept somebody there that's going to

4091.839 --> 4095.839
have a real voice and a real point yeah

4093.68 --> 4097.679
you got to like

4095.839 --> 4100.239
talk a little you know you got to like

4097.679 --> 4102.88
figure out where your positions are

4100.239 --> 4105.2789999999995
you don't by default oh he likes to come

4102.88 --> 4107.1990000000005
there ben never say a word again for

4105.279 --> 4108.64
years and years and years never allowed

4107.199 --> 4111.199
on again

4108.64 --> 4115.279
that's what bob does he's a [ __ ]

4111.199 --> 4119.2789999999995
censoring scumbag i hate him

4115.279 --> 4122.319
i hate him for specifically doing that

4119.279 --> 4124.56
he bans people because they oppose his

4122.319 --> 4128.56
ideas and then he bans them like he

4124.56 --> 4128.56
erases them from existence

4129.92 --> 4134.4
sickening

4131.359 --> 4135.89
like that is genuinely sickening to do

4134.4 --> 4138.879999999999
that

4135.89 --> 4140.799
[Music]

4138.88 --> 4143.1990000000005
he was making some accusations of of

4140.799 --> 4146.319
course he was of course i mean i

4143.199 --> 4148.08
reminded everybody a while ago and i

4146.319 --> 4149.679
will keep doing that

4148.08 --> 4152.4
until the end of my days i'm not going

4149.679 --> 4154.719
to do that oh oh i have to find my way

4152.4 --> 4157.44
into the chat to specifically say that

4154.719 --> 4159.12
again because i am not a dick

4157.44 --> 4161.839
yeah

4159.12 --> 4163.5199999999995
i'd like to actually talk about the

4161.839 --> 4167.359
subjects

4163.52 --> 4170.319
that are on the table in the show

4167.359 --> 4171.359
that's what i like to talk about i'm not

4170.319 --> 4173.759
there

4171.359 --> 4176.0
to find a way through to do some

4173.759 --> 4179.199
political jabbing

4176.0 --> 4181.12
i don't do that i'm not a gamma piece of

4179.199 --> 4185.199
[ __ ] scumbag

4181.12 --> 4189.199
like he is when he popped onto my show

4185.199 --> 4190.239
specifically in my chat to tell people

4189.199 --> 4193.919999999999
and me

4190.239 --> 4196.0
how i need to kill myself yeah

4193.92 --> 4198.96
which is on record i can show that to

4196.0 --> 4200.96
you when he said that

4198.96 --> 4204.32
yeah

4200.96 --> 4204.32
that was around the time

4205.04 --> 4207.28
when

4208.8 --> 4213.84
i reminded everybody

4211.12 --> 4217.04
about subjects he talked about how he

4213.84 --> 4218.0
was basically apologetic

4217.04 --> 4219.6
to

4218.0 --> 4222.48
pedophilia

4219.6 --> 4224.4800000000005
yeah he was on record on tape on his own

4222.48 --> 4227.839999999999
show it's still there

4224.48 --> 4228.959999999999
and that snippet has been copied and put

4227.84 --> 4231.04
on

4228.96 --> 4233.12
someone on samson's channel who hasn't

4231.04 --> 4235.76
been really around here for a while but

4233.12 --> 4237.679
he's still out there i think

4235.76 --> 4241.280000000001
and that video is still there on

4237.679 --> 4243.36
samson's channel i'm subscribed to him

4241.28 --> 4245.12
you could find him in my subscription

4243.36 --> 4247.04
list

4245.12 --> 4250.159
check out that video because it's just

4247.04 --> 4252.32
one video he put up there the bob nodell

4250.159 --> 4255.28
confession

4252.32 --> 4256.08
he talked about pedophiles and

4255.28 --> 4259.28
is

4256.08 --> 4261.5199999999995
repulsive beyond imagination

4259.28 --> 4264.4
and ever since i did that bob's been

4261.52 --> 4267.040000000001
squirting to no end like he literally

4264.4 --> 4269.92
was talking about that on a daily basis

4267.04 --> 4272.08
on other people's shows complaining

4269.92 --> 4275.679
about how i accused him of something

4272.08 --> 4277.76
that he literally on record has said

4275.679 --> 4280.08
without editing

4277.76 --> 4283.04
on record a straight unedited tape of

4280.08 --> 4285.5199999999995
him saying that that's still on his

4283.04 --> 4287.92
channel to this day

4285.52 --> 4290.4800000000005
and he complained about me

4287.92 --> 4293.92
accusing him of something

4290.48 --> 4296.08
that he literally did on record still on

4293.92 --> 4299.6
this channel to this day he complained

4296.08 --> 4300.48
about it for months and months like half

4299.6 --> 4302.159000000001
a year

4300.48 --> 4305.199
non-stop

4302.159 --> 4305.199
never stopped about it

4305.28 --> 4312.239
because he's a freak

4308.32 --> 4314.799999999999
and a psychopath like actual psychopath

4312.239 --> 4317.759999999999
yeah that's why i usually don't really

4314.8 --> 4320.8
like to talk about him because

4317.76 --> 4323.6
he'll just make him more psychopathic

4320.8 --> 4326.2390000000005
and he'll just start nagging me

4323.6 --> 4326.2390000000005
starting to

4326.32 --> 4332.08
throw his imperial sticks at us again

4329.28 --> 4334.08
try to get us banned from more places

4332.08 --> 4338.0
because that's what bob does

4334.08 --> 4341.44
is an imperialist scumbag that uses

4338.0 --> 4345.28
political censorship based on people

4341.44 --> 4348.639999999999
opposing his ideas and exposing his

4345.28 --> 4348.639999999999
inner deviancy

4350.32 --> 4357.799999999999
he's not a derp he's a psychopath

4353.76 --> 4357.8
an actual psychopath

4358.4 --> 4363.5199999999995
in his actions

4361.12 --> 4367.199
you understand

4363.52 --> 4368.8
it's very easy for him to justify

4367.199 --> 4371.919999999999
evil

4368.8 --> 4374.56
it's second nature to him

4371.92 --> 4376.56
he doesn't have the natural

4374.56 --> 4378.56
internal objections anyway i don't know

4376.56 --> 4379.76
why i don't really care at this point he

4378.56 --> 4382.320000000001
doesn't

4379.76 --> 4385.360000000001
he applies this all the time

4382.32 --> 4387.44
to rule to rule over people to try to

4385.36 --> 4389.199
rule over people's minds

4387.44 --> 4391.44
and use violence

4389.199 --> 4393.839999999999
psychological violence if they step out

4391.44 --> 4393.839999999999
of line

4394.0 --> 4402.239
yeah and not discipline i use discipline

4399.12 --> 4405.12
on people not violence i address them i

4402.239 --> 4408.4
confront them with their actions

4405.12 --> 4409.599999999999
i present an alternative

4408.4 --> 4411.839999999999
i help

4409.6 --> 4413.280000000001
them with an analysis with a

4411.84 --> 4415.12
constructive

4413.28 --> 4417.44
angle of approach

4415.12 --> 4420.719
bob doesn't do that

4417.44 --> 4423.759999999999
he just attacks people and puts them

4420.719 --> 4425.52
below him so he can put his boot on

4423.76 --> 4428.88
their skull

4425.52 --> 4431.92
because he's a psychopath

4428.88 --> 4434.8
who's just out to dominate everybody and

4431.92 --> 4438.4400000000005
silence them so he can rule over them

4434.8 --> 4438.4400000000005
that's what he does

4453.04 --> 4457.92
puts it gets it

4455.28 --> 4461.44
well he's a smooth operator which gets

4457.92 --> 4464.0
it very smooth talker very eloquent

4461.44 --> 4466.839999999999
very sharp psychologically

4464.0 --> 4469.36
i think he does have moral

4466.84 --> 4472.32
awareness i think he's just a very

4469.36 --> 4472.32
flexible guy

4473.76 --> 4478.8
i mean he's one of the few people that's

4475.84 --> 4481.1990000000005
like really bob adjacent but that isn't

4478.8 --> 4484.08
a complete coward numpty because of it

4481.199 --> 4487.04
he can just still be himself outside of

4484.08 --> 4487.04
bob's influence

4492.159 --> 4497.759999999999
team kosher what

4494.08 --> 4501.28
he's talking about godzilla

4497.76 --> 4504.320000000001
now he is part of the bob empire yes but

4501.28 --> 4506.8
he is his own man he is not completely

4504.32 --> 4510.0
dependent he's not a slave

4506.8 --> 4512.56
to bob's will

4510.0 --> 4512.56
his whims

4513.36 --> 4518.0
he's just very dynamic

4515.6 --> 4520.400000000001
he has talents like communication

4518.0 --> 4520.4
talents

4521.6 --> 4525.360000000001
nathan thompson

4523.52 --> 4528.320000000001
nathan thomps i don't know but nathan

4525.36 --> 4528.32
thompson is kind of

4529.92 --> 4535.36
he's like what i would call a typical

4532.239 --> 4537.839999999999
hyperactive guy

4535.36 --> 4541.199
that's not really in full control

4537.84 --> 4544.159000000001
especially the ego elements within

4541.199 --> 4546.96
and he is well

4544.159 --> 4549.599999999999
he goes with whatever

4546.96 --> 4550.8
but he's also very easy to get into a

4549.6 --> 4554.400000000001
fight with

4550.8 --> 4558.0
if you like hurt his pride or something

4554.4 --> 4560.879999999999
right but he's not like even a quarter

4558.0 --> 4562.96
as terrible as bob because bob holds on

4560.88 --> 4565.28
to [ __ ] forever

4562.96 --> 4567.04
forever

4565.28 --> 4569.28
yeah

4567.04 --> 4570.239
like i mean he's still gonna have the

4569.28 --> 4572.32
same

4570.239 --> 4574.48
[ __ ]

4572.32 --> 4576.0
[ __ ] responses like in 20 years it's

4574.48 --> 4578.08
still going to be the same if he's still

4576.0 --> 4580.96
alive then he's going to be doing

4578.08 --> 4582.719
exactly the same thing same reasons

4580.96 --> 4585.12
because of things that happened 20 years

4582.719 --> 4586.8
ago yeah i don't think nathan thompson

4585.12 --> 4589.36
is like that

4586.8 --> 4591.28
he gets inflamed he can get into a fight

4589.36 --> 4593.04
probably hey physically you could

4591.28 --> 4595.84
probably kick somebody's ass really

4593.04 --> 4598.32
easily i don't know though if he would

4595.84 --> 4598.32
not sure

4599.04 --> 4604.159
but nathan thompson doesn't really hold

4602.08 --> 4606.719
a grudge

4604.159 --> 4608.5599999999995
he does realize in the end like oh [ __ ]

4606.719 --> 4611.12
it just went out of control again let's

4608.56 --> 4613.280000000001
get under control again

4611.12 --> 4614.8
right

4613.28 --> 4618.08
so yeah

4614.8 --> 4620.159000000001
thompson is a bit of a character

4618.08 --> 4622.5599999999995
but he's not

4620.159 --> 4625.36
yeah when it comes to like

4622.56 --> 4629.52
terrible behavior he

4625.36 --> 4629.5199999999995
he's not even close to glob no deal

4633.36 --> 4638.88
he'll do more physical stuff right he is

4637.04 --> 4641.679
kind of a

4638.88 --> 4644.159000000001
a go-getter he's just like

4641.679 --> 4646.4
march in there get loud

4644.159 --> 4647.199
draw the attention get things going

4646.4 --> 4650.96
that's

4647.199 --> 4653.919999999999
what nathan thompson does

4650.96 --> 4656.64
bob doesn't really do that

4653.92 --> 4660.159
bob is rather a person that likes to be

4656.64 --> 4662.4800000000005
surrounded by his peons so he can enter

4660.159 --> 4664.639999999999
as a respected king

4662.48 --> 4666.5599999999995
because he only likes to enter places

4664.64 --> 4668.159000000001
where he know people are going to grovel

4666.56 --> 4672.52
to him

4668.159 --> 4672.5199999999995
otherwise he's just nothing

4680.08 --> 4684.239
literally took and what are you talking

4681.92 --> 4685.6
about rufus where's your proof for that

4684.239 --> 4687.04
where are you getting that information

4685.6 --> 4689.4400000000005
from

4687.04 --> 4691.5199999999995
he took steroids what what where are you

4689.44 --> 4694.159
getting that info from

4691.52 --> 4695.1990000000005
that sounds like a complete rumor to me

4694.159 --> 4697.5199999999995
rufus

4695.199 --> 4699.04
i mean i'm not excluding that it is that

4697.52 --> 4700.64
it could be true

4699.04 --> 4703.04
just saying i've never heard of that

4700.64 --> 4703.04
before

4704.239 --> 4707.839999999999
where are you getting this from

4719.36 --> 4723.92
yeah no there's no steroids dude that

4721.84 --> 4726.400000000001
guy is hyperactive

4723.92 --> 4728.4800000000005
he's hyperactive

4726.4 --> 4732.04
he's not taking steroids

4728.48 --> 4732.04
i don't think so

4739.36 --> 4744.96
but i don't know in this case i will i

4742.64 --> 4748.0
would prefer to ask

4744.96 --> 4748.96
rasta hat about that he knows much more

4748.0 --> 4751.28
about

4748.96 --> 4753.52
the signs to look out for if somebody's

4751.28 --> 4755.28
taking steroids or not

4753.52 --> 4759.88
i'm just curious as to where you're

4755.28 --> 4759.88
getting this information from rufus

4773.92 --> 4777.84
what does that even mean

4782.56 --> 4787.6
you're positive yeah but how are you

4784.8 --> 4791.159000000001

5025.28 --> 5029.599999999999
nathan seems like a good guy he's a pair

5027.199 --> 5030.879999999999
of positives i disagree with that

5029.6 --> 5032.639
entirely

5030.88 --> 5035.1990000000005
letter sage no

5032.639 --> 5036.88
no he's not

5035.199 --> 5040.4
nathan

5036.88 --> 5040.400000000001
is an egomaniac

5040.96 --> 5044.08
at least he's not like a

5054.84 --> 5059.360000000001
psychopath but yeah i think that he

5058.08 --> 5061.36
might have like

5059.36 --> 5063.679
pretty strong traits of narcissism and

5061.36 --> 5063.679
all that

5064.719 --> 5071.36
but again at least he's not a psychopath

5069.04 --> 5075.04
he is still just the person he does

5071.36 --> 5076.0
actually retract and try to recover from

5075.04 --> 5079.0
his own

5076.0 --> 5079.0
failings

5098.96 --> 5102.719
well flat sabbath

5100.88 --> 5105.1990000000005
i don't know man

5102.719 --> 5107.6
dude i don't even know how rufus ain't

5105.199 --> 5109.839999999999
robbins just ended up in my chat like

5107.6 --> 5109.84
this

5110.32 --> 5115.5199999999995
i mean i remember him from pretty much

5112.56 --> 5115.52
being a troll

5117.36 --> 5122.679
and now he's just

5119.199 --> 5122.678999999999
in my chat

5136.8 --> 5141.04
i don't know maybe he's just there as

5138.8 --> 5144.719
pawn to like

5141.04 --> 5145.84
move the subject away from analyzing bob

5144.719 --> 5148.639
nodell

5145.84 --> 5150.8
right that's what he did oh a little bit

5148.639 --> 5153.28
what do you think about nathan thompson

5150.8 --> 5155.679
oh let's let's have a page long talk

5153.28 --> 5158.48
about nathan thompson now

5155.679 --> 5162.639
to move on

5158.48 --> 5166.799999999999
from my analysis of bob nodell yeah

5162.639 --> 5170.0
are you what plant rufus are you there

5166.8 --> 5172.0
are you there specifically to like

5170.0 --> 5174.0
make me stop talking about certain

5172.0 --> 5177.04
subjects and move on to others is that

5174.0 --> 5179.92
what you're doing here rufus

5177.04 --> 5179.92
is that why you're here

5181.679 --> 5186.32
to

5182.56 --> 5188.320000000001
kind of stare me a little in a direction

5186.32 --> 5191.5199999999995
when i'm talking about things that

5188.32 --> 5194.96
are on the no-no list

5191.52 --> 5197.84
you are in the bob nordell plant

5194.96 --> 5197.84
okay

5224.639 --> 5229.12
ah right oh hey jd

5227.28 --> 5231.36
love city z you watched it very

5229.12 --> 5234.48
enjoyable yeah it was wasn't it great

5231.36 --> 5238.04
movie very good in many different ways i

5234.48 --> 5238.04
liked it a lot

5252.88 --> 5256.719
what did you think of the gamma

5255.6 --> 5259.92
by the way

5256.719 --> 5262.2390000000005
i mean that gamma guy

5259.92 --> 5265.679
remember

5262.239 --> 5270.239
like that could be bob nodell

5265.679 --> 5273.04
just imagine that guy is like bob nodell

5270.239 --> 5274.959999999999
you know bob would do that yeah nah

5273.04 --> 5277.84
probably not that bad

5274.96 --> 5279.04
now i'm even being mean to bob a little

5277.84 --> 5281.84
but yeah

5279.04 --> 5285.44
i mean

5281.84 --> 5285.4400000000005
it's almost bob nobel

5287.44 --> 5290.96
okay that's a little ad homie

5292.0 --> 5298.0
but that was like a perfect gamma

5294.32 --> 5298.0
character wasn't it like

5298.719 --> 5302.4800000000005
there were moments where i was like

5300.239 --> 5304.799999999999
thinking about the guy the main

5302.48 --> 5307.678999999999
character thinking like

5304.8 --> 5310.56
what would happen if we just like

5307.679 --> 5312.88
room overboard like to be eaten by the

5310.56 --> 5315.360000000001
piranhas or something

5312.88 --> 5315.36
this is

5316.639 --> 5320.6
unbearable that guy

5341.92 --> 5344.92
hmm

5359.12 --> 5362.639
so yeah of course

5361.199 --> 5364.239
i'm gonna analyze somebody

5362.639 --> 5366.639
psychologically and all that and

5364.239 --> 5369.678999999999
basically including exposing more

5366.639 --> 5371.12
personal dirt like spiritual things and

5369.679 --> 5373.6
yeah

5371.12 --> 5376.159
i of course expect

5373.6 --> 5378.8
those that don't they're not really fond

5376.159 --> 5381.92
of being analyzed like this

5378.8 --> 5383.84
i expect them to reciprocate

5381.92 --> 5385.92
and

5383.84 --> 5388.08
actually get real

5385.92 --> 5390.0
i mean if you want to criticize me and

5388.08 --> 5393.5199999999995
there is things about me that you can't

5390.0 --> 5397.6
criticize absolutely get real about it

5393.52 --> 5399.92
don't bluff it yeah i don't bluff

5397.6 --> 5401.1990000000005
when i analyze people i don't like

5399.92 --> 5403.84
hahaha

5401.199 --> 5407.28
i could like over exaggerate this and

5403.84 --> 5409.84
make him look really stupid no no you

5407.28 --> 5411.36
see i don't do that anymore

5409.84 --> 5414.32
why

5411.36 --> 5417.12
because it actually kind of detracts

5414.32 --> 5420.12
from real [ __ ] that's there that i can

5417.12 --> 5420.12
see

5421.44 --> 5427.199
so i don't need to exaggerate i just

5424.56 --> 5429.52
i'm honest that's usually terrible

5427.199 --> 5429.5199999999995
enough

5430.96 --> 5434.8
right and i

5432.239 --> 5437.12
fully expect people that i analyze like

5434.8 --> 5438.639
this to try and reciprocate so you go

5437.12 --> 5441.76
and analyze me

5438.639 --> 5443.52
or you rebut me you refute my analysis

5441.76 --> 5445.12
go ahead

5443.52 --> 5448.639
prove me wrong

5445.12 --> 5450.08
i want you to prove me wrong right

5448.639 --> 5452.8
but if you're going to prove me wrong

5450.08 --> 5456.8
then don't prove me wrong in the moment

5452.8 --> 5456.8
prove me wrong the rest of your life

5460.159 --> 5465.199
prove that you are better than

5462.48 --> 5467.44
my analysis prove it

5465.199 --> 5470.879999999999
yeah take that challenge actually do it

5467.44 --> 5470.879999999999
actually be a better person

5471.6 --> 5476.719
right and yeah you can analyze me and

5474.239 --> 5479.04
criticize me all you like just

5476.719 --> 5480.8
be honest about it don't just be a

5479.04 --> 5483.44
backstabbing gamma piece of [ __ ]

5480.8 --> 5485.1990000000005
fantasist that makes up [ __ ] out of

5483.44 --> 5488.08
nothing

5485.199 --> 5490.0
that drags in story association that

5488.08 --> 5493.0
doesn't even involve anything that i've

5490.0 --> 5493.0
done

5508.0 --> 5513.52
why does a greek word fish wow george

5510.48 --> 5516.0
sanford like dude

5513.52 --> 5518.88
have you gone through like a amnesia

5516.0 --> 5521.04
relapse or something i mean why the [ __ ]

5518.88 --> 5522.4800000000005
would you ask me about that

5521.04 --> 5526.159
gamma

5522.48 --> 5529.28
gamma is a very defined word that we use

5526.159 --> 5532.759999999999
right now it's a character personality

5529.28 --> 5532.759999999999
type description

5564.0 --> 5566.239
see

5567.199 --> 5572.08
fed will be going live in about nine

5569.92 --> 5574.63
minutes

5572.08 --> 5577.199
good to know

5574.63 --> 5581.84
[Music]

5577.199 --> 5581.839999999999
how would i describe my personality type

5582.239 --> 5586.959999999999
fractured

5584.639 --> 5589.84
i'm weird

5586.96 --> 5589.84
like really weird

5592.88 --> 5596.4800000000005
i mean

5594.0 --> 5596.48
i have

5597.84 --> 5601.1990000000005
like

5599.36 --> 5604.32
like that's just really complicated

5601.199 --> 5606.48
steamy traveler but i have

5604.32 --> 5608.48
traits of a lot of things

5606.48 --> 5611.44
a very like

5608.48 --> 5613.919999999999
essential core beta

5611.44 --> 5614.638999999999
position like that's literally

5613.92 --> 5618.96
like

5614.639 --> 5622.96
the spiritual levels how i work

5618.96 --> 5625.52
i'm very good at insisting like very

5622.96 --> 5628.0
very [ __ ] good if i need to be

5625.52 --> 5631.84
right that's like where my biggest power

5628.0 --> 5631.84
tends to kind of come afloat

5632.32 --> 5635.199
but

5633.36 --> 5638.48
i also have

5635.199 --> 5641.04
some gamma trait remnants

5638.48 --> 5644.5599999999995
it used to be more of that in the past

5641.04 --> 5647.5199999999995
but it was never a full gamma i i like i

5644.56 --> 5650.96
savagely hate those people like face to

5647.52 --> 5650.96
face i hate him even more

5654.48 --> 5657.759999999999
like

5655.52 --> 5660.320000000001
so i could never be that i could never

5657.76 --> 5663.76
allow myself to slip

5660.32 --> 5665.28
fully into that frequency of gamma

5663.76 --> 5666.400000000001
right

5665.28 --> 5667.84
also

5666.4 --> 5671.199
i do have

5667.84 --> 5672.639
especially in high energy some alpha

5671.199 --> 5674.239
traits

5672.639 --> 5675.679
but

5674.239 --> 5677.04
socially

5675.679 --> 5679.52
it's different

5677.04 --> 5682.96
because i am not really an alpha i'm not

5679.52 --> 5684.84
super easy to go along with people why

5682.96 --> 5687.36
because i see too

5684.84 --> 5690.56
much i can't

5687.36 --> 5692.5599999999995
easily be simple and just smooth and

5690.56 --> 5695.119000000001
just let it all happen i'm not good at

5692.56 --> 5697.679
that because i see too much

5695.119 --> 5699.599999999999
it's like hi person that i should be

5697.679 --> 5701.36
just regularly getting to know chill

5699.6 --> 5703.119000000001
just don't look into it too deeply but i

5701.36 --> 5704.4
can see this is happening to you right

5703.119 --> 5706.32
now and ah

5704.4 --> 5708.0
you're literally having burden on your

5706.32 --> 5710.239
shoulders from your family right i can

5708.0 --> 5712.48
see it i can just [ __ ] see it right

5710.239 --> 5716.799999999999
there without a word

5712.48 --> 5716.799999999999
right yeah that's getting in the way

5717.679 --> 5719.92
so

5721.6 --> 5727.76
alpha beta

5724.159 --> 5730.96
gamma and delta right in

5727.76 --> 5732.4800000000005
in my fanaticism is very delta very

5730.96 --> 5734.4800000000005
mechanical

5732.48 --> 5737.5199999999995
so

5734.48 --> 5737.5199999999995
what does that make me

5738.88 --> 5743.76
not an alpha not like

5741.52 --> 5746.2390000000005
only traits of it so would that would

5743.76 --> 5748.2390000000005
make me like what is it

5746.239 --> 5750.32
an omega or something

5748.239 --> 5752.4
like i don't even fully understand what

5750.32 --> 5754.719
that is the omega

5752.4 --> 5757.36
i just know i have traits from all these

5754.719 --> 5759.36
things and

5757.36 --> 5761.92
it's going to be hard for people to

5759.36 --> 5761.92
place me

5763.36 --> 5768.239
and there might be people that will just

5765.36 --> 5771.759999999999
say like oh he is a gamma transition

5768.239 --> 5775.599999999999
into delta and i'd be like okay fine

5771.76 --> 5777.119000000001
but i do have special abilities

5775.6 --> 5782.1990000000005
they're just not

5777.119 --> 5782.199
totally standard happening all the time

5783.61 --> 5787.36
[Music]

5784.96 --> 5790.8
so yeah that's not a very easy question

5787.36 --> 5790.799999999999
to answer steamy traveler

5793.04 --> 5795.679
right

5794.719 --> 5796.719
it's like

5795.679 --> 5799.4400000000005
i have

5796.719 --> 5802.2390000000005
properties that i think are alpha but

5799.44 --> 5805.599999999999
they could also be like

5802.239 --> 5805.599999999999
refined gamma

5806.639 --> 5810.84
like when i get really

5808.56 --> 5812.4800000000005
passionate and angry and

5810.84 --> 5815.119000000001
like

5812.48 --> 5817.919999999999
judgmental

5815.119 --> 5820.32
i really tried to do it in an alpha way

5817.92 --> 5822.32
not a gamma way you because you can be

5820.32 --> 5824.159
like that in a gamma way and then

5822.32 --> 5826.239
everybody hates you

5824.159 --> 5828.638999999999
because they should because gammas are

5826.239 --> 5831.5199999999995
[ __ ] disgusting

5828.639 --> 5832.4800000000005
and ego maniacal and unrelenting and

5831.52 --> 5835.360000000001
just

5832.48 --> 5838.48
nothing constructive that they do when

5835.36 --> 5842.159
they're enraged so i do that i try to do

5838.48 --> 5842.159
that in an alpha setting

5844.56 --> 5850.719
all ears are alpha no

5848.96 --> 5852.2390000000005
no

5850.719 --> 5855.719
no

5852.239 --> 5855.718999999999
no they're not

5862.88 --> 5867.28
no i think that most

5864.8 --> 5869.679
fears are

5867.28 --> 5872.4
either delta or gamma

5869.679 --> 5874.88
i think universally most people are

5872.4 --> 5877.04
either gamma or delta there is a lot of

5874.88 --> 5879.1990000000005
gammas in this world but they can

5877.04 --> 5882.8
transition into delta

5879.199 --> 5885.199
if they take the effort

5882.8 --> 5887.4400000000005
i think actual alphas are kind of rare

5885.199 --> 5887.44
now

5888.48 --> 5892.48
i bet there has been a whole bunch of

5890.32 --> 5895.5199999999995
alphas that were literally just

5892.48 --> 5895.889999999999
spiritually mutilated that kind of turn

5895.52 --> 5897.679
into

5895.89 --> 5899.52
[Music]

5897.679 --> 5902.4800000000005
gammas

5899.52 --> 5904.88
because just their ability had been like

5902.48 --> 5904.879999999999
broken

5909.44 --> 5914.239
i'd like to think that when i was much

5911.76 --> 5915.04
younger i thought that i was an alpha i

5914.239 --> 5918.239
was

5915.04 --> 5918.239
i was gonna do that

5918.8 --> 5923.04
i had really big

5921.119 --> 5925.759999999999
ideas for myself

5923.04 --> 5927.679
that included social ability to go

5925.76 --> 5931.360000000001
around and be stable

5927.679 --> 5934.639
but then all kinds of [ __ ] happened

5931.36 --> 5936.839999999999
i became more intellectually involved

5934.639 --> 5940.0
and that kind of got in the

5936.84 --> 5942.56
way if i hadn't like chosen to be a

5940.0 --> 5945.199
wizard then i might now be an alpha

5942.56 --> 5946.8
instead or i might be dead because of

5945.199 --> 5948.0
vaxis because i

5946.8 --> 5950.0
wouldn't have

5948.0 --> 5951.119
had the smarts to actually stop that

5950.0 --> 5955.119
then

5951.119 --> 5955.119
right it's very complicated

5956.92 --> 5960.079
[Music]

5962.239 --> 5966.638999999999
but yeah being very smart

5964.8 --> 5968.4800000000005
and intelligent and knowledgeable and

5966.639 --> 5971.1990000000005
disciplined

5968.48 --> 5974.959999999999
doesn't exactly help you in

5971.199 --> 5974.96
socially getting about easily

5975.76 --> 5977.92
it doesn't

5976.88 --> 5980.96
at all

5977.92 --> 5983.6
not to me anyway

5980.96 --> 5985.04
but they're still learning room right

5983.6 --> 5986.96
i mean

5985.04 --> 5990.639
i'm getting better at what i do and how

5986.96 --> 5993.52
i do i compose myself better

5990.639 --> 5996.639
emotion management more discipline

5993.52 --> 5997.92
so i do feel that eventually i will be

5996.639 --> 6002.92
able to

5997.92 --> 6002.92
much move much more smoothly connect

6011.52 --> 6015.1990000000005
are gang members gamers

6017.36 --> 6020.92
mostly yeah

6024.239 --> 6027.119
a lot of them are

6027.92 --> 6034.159
but yeah a gang without a good alpha

6032.639 --> 6037.36
is usually

6034.159 --> 6039.44
a doomed gang like they are gonna go to

6037.36 --> 6042.4
ruin right if there's no proper alpha to

6039.44 --> 6044.799999999999
lead a group that's intense like that

6042.4 --> 6046.96
they're gonna [ __ ] up

6044.8 --> 6048.08
if it's only gammas they're gonna [ __ ]

6046.96 --> 6051.52
up

6048.08 --> 6053.679
but probably die

6051.52 --> 6053.679
so

6054.239 --> 6057.919999999999
yeah

6055.28 --> 6060.4
gang members that don't have an alpha to

6057.92 --> 6061.92
actually lead them usually end up dead

6060.4 --> 6064.4
very quickly

6061.92 --> 6066.719
rather quickly it'll happen at some

6064.4 --> 6066.719
point

6067.199 --> 6071.28
if we're talking about like real

6069.28 --> 6073.44
gangster [ __ ]

6071.28 --> 6075.28
